yeah that's pretty decent it's nice and

101.56 --> 110.789
warm bit cloudy sometimes did windy but

105.909 --> 110.789
not too cold I've been out on my bike

111.509 --> 118.32900000000001
basically hanging around in the city for

114.729 --> 122.25
a change and just basically sat there

118.329 --> 124.869
watched what people were doing musicians

122.25 --> 126.43
like street musicians and everything and

124.869 --> 130.709
yeah was kind of interesting with this

126.43 --> 133.709
weather was nice now it's a bit shady

130.709 --> 133.709
what

133.799 --> 140.20000000000002
see nice and blue but yeah when the Sun

138.76 --> 142.569
hit it's warm

140.2 --> 145.03
oh yeah I was basically just sitting

142.569 --> 147.45899999999997
here on the bench and was like okay the

145.03 --> 149.59
clouds are over okay keep myself warm

147.459 --> 153.849
and then it's like okay clouds are gone

149.59 --> 155.829
it's like boom heat and then I heat up

153.849 --> 157.81
again for when the clouds go away again

155.829 --> 161.43900000000002
and then I'm sufficiently heated up to

157.81 --> 166.419
basically sit through until the next

161.439 --> 168.849
time yeah let's do a more yeah so yeah

166.419 --> 175.75
hello I got to marry coffee today with

168.849 --> 180.25
me and tea no no eating I yeah I've had

175.75 --> 183.31
a very weird day yesterday so

180.25 --> 186.43
disappointment so disappointing yeah

183.31 --> 190.18
so I was supposed to have a ballbuster

186.43 --> 192.639
replacement show night night owl number

190.18 --> 195.639
three but apparently that that show

192.639 --> 199.109
number three is haunted because I can't

195.639 --> 202.739
seem to manifest it every time I try

199.109 --> 204.87900000000002
people don't show up or I get sick or I

202.739 --> 207.879
completely forget about it something

204.879 --> 210.22
gets in the way and this time happened

207.879 --> 214.78
is that my internet connection just

210.22 --> 217.629
broke went out well no yeah usually it's

214.78 --> 219.519
just okay take it in and out start

217.629 --> 225.009
working again no problem this time it

219.519 --> 227.919
didn't and yeah my roommate that's in

225.009 --> 231.569
the room where the device where the

227.919 --> 235.68900000000002
modem is wasn't home so I called her and

231.569 --> 238.689
she said yeah I'll be back in roughly

235.689 --> 240.28
two hours which was kind of exactly when

238.689 --> 247.15
my show was starting so I was like ah

240.28 --> 251.09
really so yeah I waited all that I no

247.15 --> 256.53000000000003
internet no way to reset it

251.09 --> 259.109
it's ridiculous situation really and I'm

256.53 --> 261.71999999999997
seriously but I got myself pretty worked

259.109 --> 264.21
up but I mellowed down eventually

261.72 --> 266.46000000000004
because I really had prepared for the

264.21 --> 268.44
show I had like beers and I thought like

266.46 --> 270.59999999999997
yeah we're gonna I'm gonna I was very

268.44 --> 274.32
enthusiastic about it and then just

270.6 --> 277.97900000000004
nothing right so it was time

274.32 --> 280.919
9 o'clock 9 o'clock p.m. Amsterdam time

277.979 --> 283.40999999999997
and she didn't show up so I called like

280.919 --> 286.46999999999997
yeah well are you there yet

283.41 --> 290.34000000000003
she is like now sorry I this is your

286.47 --> 292.56
problem I I'm not gonna I don't care

290.34 --> 294.09
like oh great yeah

292.56 --> 297.24
thanks that's definitely going to

294.09 --> 299.21999999999997
improve our relation thanks for that so

297.24 --> 301.919
yeah she basically probably went out or

299.22 --> 305.82000000000005
something and I ended up going to bed

301.919 --> 308.82
early but not before I had my beers and

305.82 --> 312.02
basically watched Fletch which is kind

308.82 --> 316.82
of really a fun way to spend your time

312.02 --> 320.07
good old 80 synthesizer I love that [ __ ]

316.82 --> 324.479
so yeah it wasn't a waste of my time

320.07 --> 328.229
entirely and it was interesting not not

324.479 --> 331.889
being detached games and [ __ ] on the

328.229 --> 335.159
internet like so many of them are got

331.889 --> 337.02
time-based and it's interesting not just

335.159 --> 339.51
being closed off from that and that was

337.02 --> 341.4
kind of good actually because I I'm not

339.51 --> 343.5
like a Facebook and it's like constantly

341.4 --> 346.44
your Twitter like every single freaking

343.5 --> 349.139
message no never gonna get into that I

346.44 --> 351.599
would hate it but with games

349.139 --> 352.44
it's almost internet game it's almost

351.599 --> 356.28
the same

352.44 --> 359.63
you still get like the the constant

356.28 --> 363.35999999999996
conditioning time-based conditioning and

359.63 --> 365.31
yeah I have gotten caught into that type

363.36 --> 368.22
of game

365.31 --> 370.35
although yeah I don't do too many at the

368.22 --> 376.20000000000005
same time like I don't really care that

370.35 --> 377.73
much about it and it's fun way for me to

376.2 --> 381.12
basically socialize on a more

377.73 --> 383.70000000000005
superficial level like team oriented and

381.12 --> 388.5
that's good because you don't have to

383.7 --> 390.03
get into conversations really deeply

388.5 --> 390.389
that way and it's good to have that as

390.03 --> 394.28999999999996
well

390.389 --> 401.31
so anyway yeah there was no night I'll

394.29 --> 404.19
show and yeah my landlord - you know

401.31 --> 406.89
like apparently he just didn't pick up

404.19 --> 409.14
so and he basically said to me like yeah

406.89 --> 411.87
the next time it happens just call me

409.14 --> 413.15999999999997
all I did he didn't pick up and he said

411.87 --> 416.97
like yeah you're gonna have to work this

413.16 --> 419.01000000000005
out yourself like what the hell so I'm

416.97 --> 423.24
gonna get some legal counsel on this

419.01 --> 426.21
because this just ridiculous and I'm

423.24 --> 428.669
also gonna have to save up now for well

426.21 --> 430.73999999999995
an alternative plan because I figured

428.669 --> 435.15
maybe I'm just gonna have to put in a

430.74 --> 437.34000000000003
direct internet cable it's gonna be long

435.15 --> 440.64
I'm gonna have to measure it's probably

437.34 --> 442.56
gonna be 25 meters at least it's gonna

440.64 --> 445.56
go throughout the entire house I already

442.56 --> 449.28000000000003
got a route planned for it but once I

445.56 --> 451.26
get that then yeah then it's no more

449.28 --> 454.73999999999995
issue there's never gonna be connection

451.26 --> 459.21
issues after that so that would solve

454.74 --> 463.289
the problem anyway let's see who's in

459.21 --> 467.58
chat and rambling about my home problems

463.289 --> 474.71
enough yeah hello Steve was in there

467.58 --> 474.71

483.4 --> 491.31899999999996
by Steve I was on a hangout it was just

487.81 --> 493.78000000000003
in the chat something punch of Pete was

491.319 --> 496.69
doing and Dell was in there and they

493.78 --> 499.98999999999995
were like troll fighting it it was

496.69 --> 504.15
hilarious I got involved as well it was

499.99 --> 507.43
kind of funny I think it's still going

504.15 --> 510.62899999999996
hey five artists lemur Alice I ran T

507.43 --> 510.629

oh really you want to see it okay okay

535.48 --> 541.139
ranty let me get it

548.009 --> 555.29
I don't know if it's still going anyway

552.42 --> 555.29
this is the link

556.19 --> 566.5
no it's still going he's reviewing

561.89 --> 569.3
somebody else yeah like a Christian

566.5 --> 570.67
conspiracy theorist thing it's it's all

569.3 --> 581.8199999999999
over the place

570.67 --> 583.99
typical poncho Pete hello Voynich right

581.82 --> 586.99
[Music]

583.99 --> 586.99
so

593.99 --> 600.14
yeah well for obvious reasons I

597.86 --> 602.69
literally haven't been watching any

600.14 --> 606.56
videos any YouTube videos because I

602.69 --> 613.07
didn't have any internet so I have not a

606.56 --> 616.64
lot to report on actually kind of did

613.07 --> 618.23
literally nothing yeah I was there at

616.64 --> 623.18
the debates though that was that was

618.23 --> 625.01
good had a good go and that's it after

623.18 --> 629.4799999999999
that point the internet got caught off

625.01 --> 630.92
and I just watched yeah the movie Fletch

629.48 --> 637.72
and that was fun

630.92 --> 637.7199999999999
but that's it wait

638.93 --> 641.559
what did I do

649.93 --> 655.529
I couldn't have been it just that

666.24 --> 673.679
no I think that may actually be it so

668.699 --> 676.0999999999999
yeah yeah Fletch is a classic I I really

673.679 --> 684.119
like the movie because it shows just how

676.1 --> 687.029
good an actor that guy is and like just

684.119 --> 689.879
how he Bluffs his way through and really

687.029 --> 692.73
well and still kind of realistic and

689.879 --> 695.129
there were such funny seems ridiculous

692.73 --> 697.47
funny scenes that were like making

695.129 --> 700.429
relatively boring things suddenly very

697.47 --> 703.23
funny and interesting like that dog

700.429 --> 705.569
jumping through the window to get him

703.23 --> 709.8290000000001
that was so but it was freaking

705.569 --> 713.8389999999999
hilarious and that is like a really

709.829 --> 716.9699999999999
subtle movie magic thing that's not

713.839 --> 720.4200000000001
outrageous but it is kind of silly and

716.97 --> 728.1890000000001
it makes the movie really fun and that's

720.42 --> 731.699
it's a really a classic like 80s yeah a

728.189 --> 733.199
good eighties way of building a movie

731.699 --> 738.7489999999999
and that's what I like about it and

733.199 --> 743.99
music is so so in tuna so cheesy but in

738.749 --> 746.6990000000001
a great way I don't know I love it yeah

743.99 --> 749.339
it's it's one of those movies you can

746.699 --> 750.99
watch every now and then especially if

749.339 --> 755.639
you have nothing better to do any after

750.99 --> 759.449
some time to waste it's really chill and

755.639 --> 764.189
it ends like it's weird because it just

759.449 --> 765.5089999999999
pretty much certainly ends like the way

764.189 --> 767.879
dance you would think like yeah that

765.509 --> 771.089
guy's just gonna keep on go going doing

767.879 --> 774.089
what he does and yeah they didn't have

771.089 --> 776.4590000000001
time to film it all because he the way

774.089 --> 780.089
he does it just keeps on going and going

776.459 --> 786.2589999999999
it's yeah it's probably one of his peak

780.089 --> 786.259
moments in movies yep love that guy

790.25 --> 796.26
anyway this way you do have something to

792.66 --> 801.38
talk about because I didn't get to see

796.26 --> 813.65
any YouTube videos I can't flick through

801.38 --> 817.59
see what did come by alright Randy did a

813.65 --> 821.5799999999999
diffraction limit understanding with

817.59 --> 823.5300000000001
conspiracy cats I got hilarious and I

821.58 --> 828.69
already saw the DeGeorge seen a tanuki

823.53 --> 834.12
do a blood from Nathan non sequitur

828.69 --> 838.11
agreement oh god oh god Nathan really

834.12 --> 844.38
you mirrored that oh yeah I guess you

838.11 --> 846.0500000000001
would after everything the all the [ __ ]

844.38 --> 849.72
he knows that that channel has subjected

846.05 --> 852.5999999999999
us all to they cant deserve pretty much

849.72 --> 856.23
anything we can throw at him so I but

852.6 --> 859.1700000000001
it's just i personally don't even want

856.23 --> 863.04
to touch it it's like when you fight

859.17 --> 865.7099999999999
[ __ ] demons you tend to get covered in

863.04 --> 872.63
[ __ ] you know i just don't like the

865.71 --> 872.63
smell of it yeah what else

874.91 --> 879.26
ya know Owen Benjamin

885.61 --> 890.9300000000001
that's weird

888.18 --> 890.93
okay

892.6 --> 898.0790000000001
oh yeah and the iron fro media I saw

895.48 --> 898.0790000000001
part of it

902.35 --> 908.6800000000001
all right flatter British had a thing -

905.8 --> 910.9799999999999
I completely yeah wasn't on line to see

908.68 --> 910.9799999999999
it

915.81 --> 929.3
right okay well we'll just see what we

919.259 --> 929.3000000000001
can talk about wait what

930.78 --> 938.76
so what kind of no platform is going to

934.29 --> 941.8499999999999
be alright

938.76 --> 943.35
yeah well if there really look i I don't

941.85 --> 945.09
know where you're getting this

943.35 --> 948.45
information it's the first time I'm

945.09 --> 949.2900000000001
airing it it it's pretty ridiculous

948.45 --> 953.21
really

949.29 --> 955.77
it's literally they are just yeah

953.21 --> 958.32
committing suicide almost if they will

955.77 --> 962.93
do that like what's left what's left

958.32 --> 967.2900000000001
from YouTube it'll just be like CNN too

962.93 --> 971.87
if they start to do that and just a

967.29 --> 971.87
bunch of upload video [ __ ] everywhere

973.76 --> 980.72
got a couple of months [ __ ]

977.51 --> 983.45
that's terrible

980.72 --> 985.34
well if that happens I'm just gonna have

983.45 --> 988.4000000000001
to move on to other platforms I've

985.34 --> 990.89
already considered some I've seen people

988.4 --> 994.04
do try other things things like D live

990.89 --> 1001.6899999999999
and [ __ ] shoot is apparently something

994.04 --> 1004.4499999999999
and a lot of other things it's it's

1001.69 --> 1010.6
gonna take some used to getting used to

1004.45 --> 1012.76
for me I'm not very eager natcher

1010.6 --> 1015.6700000000001
I'm not naturally eager to like dive

1012.76 --> 1016.9
onto new platforms but yeah this guys

1015.67 --> 1019.39
I'm gonna have to try

1016.9 --> 1023.41
oh yeah twitch I might try twitch as

1019.39 --> 1026.949
well it would be good because yeah

1023.41 --> 1031.0
talking about D&D which I do would

1026.949 --> 1034.1200000000001
definitely touch a certain group of

1031.0 --> 1037.0
gamers in that in that platform so that

1034.12 --> 1038.6499999999999
could work and yeah that I'm just gonna

1037.0 --> 1040.569
be talking about different types of

1038.65 --> 1042.189
things as I have been doing just my

1040.569 --> 1047.04
interest which goes all over the place

1042.189 --> 1051.52
from gaming to world building

1047.04 --> 1054.97
alternative history comparing movies and

1051.52 --> 1057.96
narratives and ideas with actual

1054.97 --> 1065.02
historical events all that cosmogony

1057.96 --> 1068.26
science-y and my journey in trying to

1065.02 --> 1071.44
improve science basically it's just

1068.26 --> 1075.01
absurdly difficult but still it's very

1071.44 --> 1077.02
much in a conceptual phase all of it but

1075.01 --> 1079.27
that's what I'm doing and yeah we'll

1077.02 --> 1081.7
just see how that all touches on the new

1079.27 --> 1087.79
platforms I have no idea I have no idea

1081.7 --> 1090.3400000000001
if it's gonna be money viable even but

1087.79 --> 1092.11
at least I'm gonna give it a try I will

1090.34 --> 1094.1799999999998
just see what happens I don't know I

1092.11 --> 1099.6399999999999
don't know what type of algorithms they

1094.18 --> 1103.2
apply to to their platforms so I have no

1099.64 --> 1103.2
idea what will happen

1110.53 --> 1113.19
yeah

1114.23 --> 1127.8600000000001
right I might have missed that email I

1116.91 --> 1130.47
don't check my email that often so well

1127.86 --> 1134.1599999999999
if it's gonna happen if YouTube's like

1130.47 --> 1136.98
really shutting that down if you'll even

1134.16 --> 1140.1000000000001
get to that I think that when that

1136.98 --> 1143.88
happens yeah because of this strain it

1140.1 --> 1147.03
will cause on the wire public I think

1143.88 --> 1151.1100000000001
that's the moment that like the the

1147.03 --> 1154.29
corporate heads are gonna be yeah I rest

1151.11 --> 1157.11
it basically and it's gonna be taken

1154.29 --> 1160.44
away from them and it's gonna be more

1157.11 --> 1166.82
yeah split up and maybe even nationalize

1160.44 --> 1171.21
like designated to government or to a

1166.82 --> 1173.49
yeah international public platform based

1171.21 --> 1175.26
on nations I don't know whatever they're

1173.49 --> 1176.49
gonna do I think that YouTube's not

1175.26 --> 1178.98
gonna be dead forever

1176.49 --> 1183.6
but they're gonna try to reinvent it

1178.98 --> 1185.13
into an actual public platform and I

1183.6 --> 1188.6999999999998
don't know how well that will actually

1185.13 --> 1192.3600000000001
work because public platforms usually

1188.7 --> 1194.28
don't have as much funding and corporate

1192.36 --> 1198.06
interest of course that'll keep it all

1194.28 --> 1199.8899999999999
safe and so it yeah we'd I don't know

1198.06 --> 1202.95
where it's gonna go really if it'll ever

1199.89 --> 1206.99
have this kind of momentum and power as

1202.95 --> 1206.99
YouTube has been enjoying

1210.6 --> 1214.83
but yeah if they're gonna take that away

1212.639 --> 1218.9089999999999
then it's gonna break up a lot of [ __ ]

1214.83 --> 1222.32
and it's already so much on the pressure

1218.909 --> 1222.3200000000002
and issues

1228.76 --> 1235.26
well anyway yeah we'll look as long as

1231.85 --> 1237.78
skypes keep keeps on going

1235.26 --> 1241.75
especially if YouTube's gonna be gone

1237.78 --> 1243.85
contact me there and you know it would

1241.75 --> 1246.85
be had it would be very good to really

1243.85 --> 1249.57
have a more technical discussion about

1246.85 --> 1253.7199999999998
these platforms and how they work and

1249.57 --> 1256.75
what you can do with them and how their

1253.72 --> 1259.03
algorithms work how the people on those

1256.75 --> 1261.16
platforms typically are what what are

1259.03 --> 1262.72
the types that are typically on there it

1261.16 --> 1266.5900000000001
would be good to have a general

1262.72 --> 1269.41
discussion so that people can basically

1266.59 --> 1274.03
yeah tune in and learn about these other

1269.41 --> 1277.059
platforms and yeah we can help everybody

1274.03 --> 1279.6689999999999
basically in this forced migration to

1277.059 --> 1283.0
the other other platforms so I am very

1279.669 --> 1287.0490000000002
much up for a wider discussion among

1283.0 --> 1291.1
flat earthers that I know and yeah my

1287.049 --> 1293.23
direct public to talk about this I think

1291.1 --> 1297.37
it's necessary to do that somewhere in

1293.23 --> 1300.309
the next few months at least so yeah

1297.37 --> 1302.26
think about it and please spread the

1300.309 --> 1307.3899999999999
word there needs to be a wider

1302.26 --> 1315.24
discussion about other platforms and how

1307.39 --> 1315.24
we can transit from YouTube so

1319.11 --> 1323.8799999999999
all right then and also yeah there's a

1322.11 --> 1326.2199999999998
lot of people that are actually just

1323.88 --> 1329.24
kind of like Alex Jones are starting to

1326.22 --> 1333.299
really do it with their own website in

1329.24 --> 1338.779
and that takes a lot of money in

1333.299 --> 1338.779
relation to riding along platforms but

1339.769 --> 1346.26
there is enough yeah there's enough

1343.769 --> 1348.0
market for it at least so there are a

1346.26 --> 1349.789
lot of people are gonna go on completely

1348.0 --> 1352.919
self-sufficient websites with their own

1349.789 --> 1355.769
video storage basically their own

1352.919 --> 1359.909
materials that's also interesting you

1355.769 --> 1365.61
know it it wouldn't be too odd an idea

1359.909 --> 1371.029
to have a well on the international

1365.61 --> 1374.1
video platform system that would be

1371.029 --> 1378.919
specifically aimed at flat earthers but

1374.1 --> 1378.9189999999999
yeah that's not going to be easy you

1379.49 --> 1399.679
know what is that let me check watch

1393.84 --> 1399.6789999999999
broadcaster strong community okay

1406.759 --> 1416.539
lifestream video chat hmm okay well that

1415.32 --> 1419.37
could work

1416.539 --> 1424.309
don't know what what type of people hang

1419.37 --> 1424.309
around here but I guess that could work

1428.629 --> 1435.629
interesting right okay I'll just

1431.759 --> 1439.6490000000001
bookmark this among all the others it's

1435.629 --> 1444.869
going to be basically a yeah an update a

1439.649 --> 1448.35
social media research updates damn all

1444.869 --> 1451.22
these platforms what I guess it's good

1448.35 --> 1451.2199999999998
that they are there now

1458.67 --> 1461.789
[Music]

1465.08 --> 1467.739
yeah

1469.49 --> 1472.39
nonsense

1481.29 --> 1489.54
really yeah unsalted you really got to

1485.49 --> 1492.03
explain to me how how exactly Alex Jones

1489.54 --> 1493.98
is controlled opposition or even project

1492.03 --> 1497.09
Mockingbird you really got to tell me

1493.98 --> 1499.8600000000001
that because I really want to hear that

1497.09 --> 1503.9099999999999
look I've been following him for 20

1499.86 --> 1507.2099999999998
years okay and that includes [ __ ] that

1503.91 --> 1509.88
people said about him and thinks that he

1507.21 --> 1512.46
emphasized that people say about him

1509.88 --> 1514.5300000000002
which tends to differ a lot from what

1512.46 --> 1517.74
the general people and his followers

1514.53 --> 1521.549
actually say about him so I've been very

1517.74 --> 1526.34
up to date about who Alex Jones really

1521.549 --> 1530.94
is what he does how he tends to bend

1526.34 --> 1534.24
reality just a tiny bit but he tries not

1530.94 --> 1536.309
to bend the information itself although

1534.24 --> 1541.86
he loves to put things in a political

1536.309 --> 1543.8999999999999
context at it but yeah it's all about

1541.86 --> 1546.51
what you're looking at are you gonna

1543.9 --> 1550.8300000000002
take the information or are you gonna

1546.51 --> 1554.73
take the illusion what is it you want

1550.83 --> 1558.96
from it you know and that's how I've

1554.73 --> 1562.47
been watching him and yes in a sense

1558.96 --> 1566.01
indeed he is burying himself with his

1562.47 --> 1568.25
choices but that's just simply how it

1566.01 --> 1568.25
works

1574.28 --> 1577.47
[Music]

1581.53 --> 1595.6589999999999
half his family is CIA really so you

1588.85 --> 1598.09
mean there are CIA people that are yeah

1595.659 --> 1599.7990000000002
basically joining the family in that

1598.09 --> 1601.6899999999998
sense well that would make perfect sense

1599.799 --> 1605.23
of course they want to keep him very

1601.69 --> 1607.059
close I think that Alex Jones is not as

1605.23 --> 1613.3600000000001
controlled opposition as you would think

1607.059 --> 1615.8799999999999
I think he in a sense he is controlled

1613.36 --> 1618.76
but not the way you think not by his

1615.88 --> 1621.3700000000001
full original cooperation I think they

1618.76 --> 1622.9
basically just locked him in and just

1621.37 --> 1625.059
said yeah keep on doing what you're

1622.9 --> 1629.409
doing but we're gonna modify certain

1625.059 --> 1633.73
things and we'll make sure that it won't

1629.409 --> 1636.49
be in a way that your signature thing

1633.73 --> 1639.46
will be disturbed so we're just gonna

1636.49 --> 1643.299
give you certain suggestions and you can

1639.46 --> 1647.6200000000001
make of that what you want and it's a

1643.299 --> 1651.1
matter of trust it's sources so it's

1647.62 --> 1653.3799999999999
almost like again the Chinese emperor

1651.1 --> 1655.24
affected like what Trump and the deep

1653.38 --> 1657.5490000000002
State is to Chinese emperor affect

1655.24 --> 1660.429
Chinese emperor being completely locked

1657.549 --> 1662.74
in by the political system that is

1660.429 --> 1665.3200000000002
withholding information from the Emperor

1662.74 --> 1667.24
and at the same time yeah not

1665.32 --> 1668.8899999999999
cooperating and doing trying to do as

1667.24 --> 1670.96
much of their own thing as they can and

1668.89 --> 1674.0800000000002
sneak sneakily get away with it every

1670.96 --> 1676.059
time and I think that Alex Jones in his

1674.08 --> 1679.09
own way with the Secret Service has this

1676.059 --> 1682.33
kind of a relation he's basically

1679.09 --> 1686.5
surrounded by the Secret Service that

1682.33 --> 1688.78
are hostile and not hostile and it's

1686.5 --> 1691.84
very difficult to really get to the

1688.78 --> 1693.9089999999999
bottom of it and there's always chances

1691.84 --> 1698.23
of sudden blackmail and [ __ ] it's very

1693.909 --> 1700.0900000000001
difficult and he is thus not as the in

1698.23 --> 1702.34
the open like with the government but

1700.09 --> 1705.789
kind of in the secret in the shadows he

1702.34 --> 1709.48
is also being surrounded by the Secret

1705.789 --> 1711.82
Service that are locking him in in a

1709.48 --> 1713.89
similar way to the Chinese emperor setup

1711.82 --> 1715.52
but in the shadows by the Secret Service

1713.89 --> 1719.0900000000001
so that is how I see

1715.52 --> 1723.429
in that sense yes he is controlled but

1719.09 --> 1727.99
he's not he's basically forced and

1723.429 --> 1730.67
forcibly controlled because he still

1727.99 --> 1734.0
wants to do his own thing and trust me

1730.67 --> 1736.28
that enforced control that circle

1734.0 --> 1743.78
surrounding him is a big strain on him

1736.28 --> 1747.11
because he yeah because he know he knows

1743.78 --> 1749.96
it like he knows that he's also being

1747.11 --> 1752.1789999999999
nudged in directions that originally

1749.96 --> 1756.52
definitely didn't want to go I bet and

1752.179 --> 1759.0800000000002
he's still trying to some times like

1756.52 --> 1761.3899999999999
like subtly break the ice a bit see if

1759.08 --> 1763.1599999999999
he can get away with it he is trying to

1761.39 --> 1766.88
be more critical of Israel have you

1763.16 --> 1770.66
taken notice of this like he he really

1766.88 --> 1775.19
does respond but he there's all this

1770.66 --> 1777.3200000000002
freaking agenda [ __ ] over him that the

1775.19 --> 1780.94
Secret Service is basically trying to

1777.32 --> 1784.82
maneuver him with and I don't think he

1780.94 --> 1787.309
that's like his choice it's just being

1784.82 --> 1789.4099999999999
like yeah if you're gonna go there then

1787.309 --> 1791.96
you're gonna have real serious issues

1789.41 --> 1796.13
and very specifically so that kind of

1791.96 --> 1797.6000000000001
setup it's I don't know I get it if you

1796.13 --> 1799.46
just think oh this is way too

1797.6 --> 1800.4199999999998
complicated to think about it like that

1799.46 --> 1802.64
you know

1800.42 --> 1807.5
he's just a she'll he will always was

1802.64 --> 1811.01
and he was either Bill Hicks or yeah a

1807.5 --> 1815.24
woman or a woman became Bill Hicks and

1811.01 --> 1817.73
then I like right yeah I don't really

1815.24 --> 1821.6
care about that [ __ ] at all I'm just

1817.73 --> 1824.3600000000001
interested in what's going on with this

1821.6 --> 1827.05
guy what is he trying to achieve how is

1824.36 --> 1830.87
he being seduced how is he being coerced

1827.05 --> 1833.45
to what level how much of it does he

1830.87 --> 1839.4399999999998
realize and how much of it does he want

1833.45 --> 1843.43
to realize and yeah I don't know

1839.44 --> 1846.55
I I do find an interest interesting

1843.43 --> 1848.2
still but yeah there is a lot of issues

1846.55 --> 1856.29
with Alex Jones and they're getting

1848.2 --> 1856.29
worse it's it's weird

1858.29 --> 1865.34
ah yes a gym you really have to put that

1862.67 --> 1871.19
dairy with the capital letters and then

1865.34 --> 1874.4299999999998
misspell it as well but yeah I think

1871.19 --> 1879.47
that all this conspiracy nonsense is

1874.43 --> 1882.8500000000001
highly overblown is concerning Alice

1879.47 --> 1886.43
it's it's almost as bad as with Patricia

1882.85 --> 1889.36
but with Alex Jones yeah at the same

1886.43 --> 1892.79
time they did kind of attention graph

1889.36 --> 1894.6499999999999
using the rumors and so did out Alex

1892.79 --> 1897.85
Jones did that and Patricia did that as

1894.65 --> 1902.51
well like try to joke with it like the

1897.85 --> 1904.1
secrets [ __ ] and sneaky pretend like it

1902.51 --> 1906.26
might be real you know that kind of

1904.1 --> 1909.83
thing and Alex Jones did that all the

1906.26 --> 1911.57
time as well and that may be very useful

1909.83 --> 1914.33
to grab a lot of people's attention on

1911.57 --> 1916.52
the short run the long run you got a

1914.33 --> 1919.04
problem really every time when you do

1916.52 --> 1927.83
that because the effect of it wears off

1919.04 --> 1932.36
and then you're stuck so in in having

1927.83 --> 1938.4499999999998
done all that I never I try never to do

1932.36 --> 1941.6899999999998
I used to kind of do that like to try to

1938.45 --> 1947.6000000000001
arouse suspicion just to grab people's

1941.69 --> 1949.5800000000002
attention and that's yeah it can be fun

1947.6 --> 1953.23
on the short run but a long run people

1949.58 --> 1956.3899999999999
are gonna recognize you with that and

1953.23 --> 1958.76
they're just gonna no longer like you

1956.39 --> 1962.0200000000002
and completely distrust you so it's it's

1958.76 --> 1965.06
just not a useful thing to do really

1962.02 --> 1969.32
it's only good if you want to exit the

1965.06 --> 1972.2
scene very quickly after that and well

1969.32 --> 1972.74
Alex Jones definitely isn't exiting the

1972.2 --> 1974.6000000000001
scene

1972.74 --> 1977.06
he's just keeps on going and going and

1974.6 --> 1977.81
going and he's making sure that he keeps

1977.06 --> 1981.9199999999998
on going

1977.81 --> 1985.69
he completely built his own video system

1981.92 --> 1985.69
basically at this point

1987.82 --> 1999.98
anyway a GM please stop the Cape's

1992.06 --> 2002.94
it's really annoying stop it [ __ ]

1999.98 --> 2002.94
seriously

2008.6 --> 2012.83
[Music]

2010.05 --> 2012.83
all right

2021.78 --> 2025.6399999999999
yeah that's right

2026.09 --> 2032.6299999999999
that's correct unsalted

2029.44 --> 2032.63
[Music]

2034.639 --> 2043.2489999999998
Stratford hmm okay I will look that up

2040.19 --> 2048.27
dust ringabel

2043.249 --> 2050.569
trapped it's weird that you never hear

2048.27 --> 2050.569
about that

2056.71 --> 2059.71
okay

2072.69 --> 2082.429
so what is this I don't know there is

2076.079 --> 2084.9900000000002
just a company intelligence company

2082.429 --> 2087.7400000000002
that's what they seem to be advertising

2084.99 --> 2091.7599999999998
with geopolitical Intelligence Platform

2087.74 --> 2091.7599999999998
so I don't know

2101.4 --> 2107.64
is it like Blackwater really are they

2105.6 --> 2111.93
military it sounds like they're just a

2107.64 --> 2116.97
an intelligence organization a private

2111.93 --> 2119.8199999999997
intelligence organization so that's not

2116.97 --> 2121.77
like Blackwater at all I think although

2119.82 --> 2124.44
I don't know maybe they do have like a

2121.77 --> 2126.68
military arm that doesn't show on this

2124.44 --> 2126.68
website

2147.09 --> 2156.61
military logistics okay sure if you say

2150.4 --> 2159.64
so I can't see it right here but yeah

2156.61 --> 2166.51
alright so yeah right so he has

2159.64 --> 2171.31
associations I like what is the angle to

2166.51 --> 2174.4
this because if you're gonna say yeah

2171.31 --> 2177.85
he's tied in with the intelligence yeah

2174.4 --> 2179.2000000000003
no [ __ ] and I wouldn't be surprised if

2177.85 --> 2182.47
he is with the military-industrial

2179.2 --> 2185.29
complex because every time he just

2182.47 --> 2186.81
starts to spout out its nucleo and all

2185.29 --> 2190.69
that [ __ ]

2186.81 --> 2198.2799999999997
it's he's like a flip-flop Warhawk

2190.69 --> 2201.67
himself at times but if that yeah it you

2198.28 --> 2204.1600000000003
could say it might just be his is like

2201.67 --> 2206.41
American dominance hunger or something I

2204.16 --> 2208.48
don't know what that is but yeah that

2206.41 --> 2211.21
has always aroused my suspicions that is

2208.48 --> 2213.37
usually like generally speaking a

2211.21 --> 2215.8
narrative of peace but then suddenly in

2213.37 --> 2217.8399999999997
a tight in a tense situation he can like

2215.8 --> 2220.4500000000003
flip-flop it so no we should just

2217.84 --> 2223.78
freaking show them American power just

2220.45 --> 2225.73
nuke it all know that [ __ ] if you

2223.78 --> 2229.03
followed Alex Jones then you know that

2225.73 --> 2231.01
he's he's been saying things like that

2229.03 --> 2232.9
like over and over I've caught him at

2231.01 --> 2234.01
least like six or seven times in the

2232.9 --> 2239.29
last twenty years

2234.01 --> 2242.44
it just goes talking like that but it's

2239.29 --> 2246.79
yeah that might be yeah maybe he really

2242.44 --> 2248.88
is like a neocon after all but I don't

2246.79 --> 2248.88
know

2250.1 --> 2259.42
I don't know what it is I think it's all

2252.8 --> 2259.42
very watered-down and complicated really

2270.59 --> 2276.98
yeah yeah yeah unsalted that's true he

2273.47 --> 2281.0299999999997
does definitely have like there's

2276.98 --> 2284.3
definitely political targets that's very

2281.03 --> 2287.38
obvious it's mostly to Chinese though

2284.3 --> 2291.38
when secondary is also the yeah the

2287.38 --> 2294.94
Islam of course but yeah on the other

2291.38 --> 2297.98
hand this has a huge point at it like

2294.94 --> 2301.4
you know we talks about all that and the

2297.98 --> 2303.7400000000002
whole migration situation what's going

2301.4 --> 2306.38
on what the elites basically planned for

2303.74 --> 2308.18
us in Europe especially but also America

2306.38 --> 2310.01
and but the thing is that's freaking

2308.18 --> 2314.33
real the only problem about is it's

2310.01 --> 2318.3500000000004
always aimed at a specific part of the

2314.33 --> 2320.81
whole to make it as as extreme as

2318.35 --> 2328.46
possible but it doesn't mean it's not

2320.81 --> 2330.65
real at all yeah okay and so that that's

2328.46 --> 2334.55
that's really nice of course you can

2330.65 --> 2340.01
always blame the Jews say that they are

2334.55 --> 2341.96
the ones that all did it that's if you

2340.01 --> 2346.25
followed Owen Benjamin then you might

2341.96 --> 2348.86
have catched on that they're kind of

2346.25 --> 2354.35
like an uneasy alliance more rather like

2348.86 --> 2358.19
I don't yeah I'm not gonna talk too much

2354.35 --> 2358.79
about it but to say that the Jews run

2358.19 --> 2363.7400000000002
China

2358.79 --> 2368.6
that's nonsense that's not true they're

2363.74 --> 2370.91
working along for now but only up to a

2368.6 --> 2374.45
certain degree it's not even the you

2370.91 --> 2378.3399999999997
know it's rather a a handful of people

2374.45 --> 2382.49
that identify themselves as but it's

2378.34 --> 2387.7000000000003
yeah how many of the general public

2382.49 --> 2387.7
really like these individuals really

2390.18 --> 2405.91
so not look the world is just a mess and

2402.27 --> 2410.56
there's people like there's always going

2405.91 --> 2411.5499999999997
to be ambitious ruthless people that are

2410.56 --> 2413.65
going to take cover

2411.55 --> 2416.86
under groups under the names of certain

2413.65 --> 2420.4
groups and then are going to abuse that

2416.86 --> 2422.8900000000003
those groups to cause [ __ ] and then let

2420.4 --> 2427.69
the group take the heat and that's

2422.89 --> 2428.7999999999997
what's going on here you've got to

2427.69 --> 2431.13
figure that out right now

2428.8 --> 2431.13
right

2440.64 --> 2448.02
yeah hello Nathan by the way Nathan

2443.44 --> 2448.02
Oakley ranty

2456.2 --> 2458.77
what

2459.5 --> 2466.15
Wow

2461.69 --> 2466.15
okay interesting

2475.38 --> 2479.76
anyway see

2497.33 --> 2502.84
right yeah and so that yeah that's the

2500.81 --> 2502.84
thing

2503.26 --> 2510.05
but that's look that's Alex's thing a

2506.48 --> 2513.53
lot and I kind of agree that it's more

2510.05 --> 2515.6000000000004
important that yeah the right to defend

2513.53 --> 2519.71
yourself is and free speech are

2515.6 --> 2523.97
maintained then whatever the average

2519.71 --> 2526.3
color of people are so I kind of agree

2523.97 --> 2526.2999999999997
to that

2535.5 --> 2541.859
it's yeah it's more about the spirit

2538.32 --> 2546.3
really and not the the color of your

2541.859 --> 2551.94
skin and I don't know it just seems to

2546.3 --> 2553.9700000000003
me even ridiculous like oh goody if you

2551.94 --> 2556.98
would hate all the other races so much

2553.97 --> 2559.859
is it really that great to then like

2556.98 --> 2561.27
okay we're now going to exclude them all

2559.859 --> 2564.5699999999997
or something or something terrible

2561.27 --> 2566.91
happens and then goodie we are stuck in

2564.57 --> 2571.77
where we are finally rid of all those

2566.91 --> 2574.46
nuisance nuisances but then at the same

2571.77 --> 2576.78
time yeah we are now in an Italian

2574.46 --> 2580.23
totalitarian empire no more freedom of

2576.78 --> 2586.9500000000003
speech no more right to defend yourself

2580.23 --> 2589.23
and is that really better off cuz yeah

2586.95 --> 2592.9199999999996
it's just gonna get worse I don't know

2589.23 --> 2596.369
it just doesn't make any sense I think

2592.92 --> 2598.08
it really is like didn't yeah we don't

2596.369 --> 2600.119
in the Netherlands we don't really have

2598.08 --> 2603.71
to right to defend ourselves anymore and

2600.119 --> 2606.78
that even to this day is just

2603.71 --> 2611.7200000000003
problematic we kind of adapted to it a

2606.78 --> 2611.7200000000003
bit but it's still problematic

2618.18 --> 2621.6189999999997
I don't know it's tough

2628.839 --> 2631.71
all right

2634.01 --> 2636.7000000000003
hmm

2666.72 --> 2672.359
yeah AGM I don't think that the Nathan

2669.8 --> 2676.02
using chat anymore I just think he just

2672.359 --> 2682.74
said hello and that's it he's probably

2676.02 --> 2684.9
starting up his show right now yeah yeah

2682.74 --> 2691.29
sorry guys it is kind of quite it's just

2684.9 --> 2693.81
it I don't know I don't really like

2691.29 --> 2702.7799999999997
these subjects to be fair I don't really

2693.81 --> 2705.359
like going here you know I think it's

2702.78 --> 2707.94
great that Owen Benjamin talks about

2705.359 --> 2710.94
that constantly because he just knows

2707.94 --> 2713.84
how to wield it I don't really I I've

2710.94 --> 2717.93
always been naturally defensive of it

2713.84 --> 2723.4500000000003
but just every time people say good Jews

2717.93 --> 2729.109
use and I just think no it's not Jews

2723.45 --> 2729.109
it's freaking individuals that are like

2729.14 --> 2737.3689999999997
pretending to be that being among them

2733.83 --> 2739.74
and just acting the opposite and for

2737.369 --> 2743.46
some crazy reason that is kind of like

2739.74 --> 2745.91
accepted by the rest that that basically

2743.46 --> 2749.4
let themselves get enslaved by these

2745.91 --> 2751.6189999999997
non-jews that are just Peres sighting of

2749.4 --> 2755.7000000000003
it all that's how I see it

2751.619 --> 2759.21
know the thing about Jews is they work

2755.7 --> 2760.589
according to religious rules and guess

2759.21 --> 2762.93
what I don't think that these people

2760.589 --> 2767.64
that are in control are actually

2762.93 --> 2770.91
following those rules and if you don't

2767.64 --> 2774.18
follow the rules does that make you the

2770.91 --> 2778.859
bad religion does that make any sense I

2774.18 --> 2780.93
don't think so so I'm just annoyed every

2778.859 --> 2783.869
time people just say Jews and the one

2780.93 --> 2786.359
hand I think it's funny on the other

2783.869 --> 2788.55
hand I don't think it's funny because

2786.359 --> 2791.8199999999997
it's also it's it's funny because it's

2788.55 --> 2793.5890000000004
sad and that's kind of hilarious that

2791.82 --> 2795.29
people can get that dumb and over

2793.589 --> 2797.7
generalizing on the other hand yeah

2795.29 --> 2799.02
that's just people that don't really

2797.7 --> 2802.4399999999996
snap out of that

2799.02 --> 2806.91
that's kind of like not a nice

2802.44 --> 2809.2200000000003
realization you know I love like it's

2806.91 --> 2811.1099999999997
like those times where just an Owen

2809.22 --> 2814.68
Benjamin it's like hilarious to just

2811.11 --> 2816.9
make like Jew jokes but just for the for

2814.68 --> 2819.3199999999997
the hot spot of it and not really nasty

2816.9 --> 2825.81
I don't like those nasty [ __ ] things

2819.32 --> 2828.15
it's just funny but don't I don't get

2825.81 --> 2830.67
this obsession over it but people I

2828.15 --> 2832.9500000000003
really don't like booth you know old man

2830.67 --> 2835.61
what's his name again I haven't seen him

2832.95 --> 2839.79
for a while maybe because I banned him

2835.61 --> 2842.3900000000003

2931.19 --> 2935.2000000000003
Nathan isn't going live because it's

2932.839 --> 2935.2
Sunday

2947.06 --> 2951.81
yep

2949.09 --> 2951.81
see

2974.06 --> 2979.7
yeah sure yeah I'll do a longer hangout

2976.58 --> 2980.15
I can I kind of got some catching up to

2979.7 --> 2982.0699999999997
do

2980.15 --> 2986.83
but the problem is I don't really have

2982.07 --> 2986.8300000000004
any subjects to talk about and I

2992.03 --> 2998.3590000000004
I felt better if you know what I mean

2994.99 --> 3004.4799999999996
but hey if I can get some guests on that

2998.359 --> 3006.609
would be nice yeah it's gonna be through

3004.48 --> 3009.43
Skype though so if you want to be on my

3006.609 --> 3013.27
panel maybe we can get a bigger panel

3009.43 --> 3015.5699999999997
going and a nice conversation that would

3013.27 --> 3015.57
be cool

3036.75 --> 3040.59
hm drop it

3046.08 --> 3057.43
hmm yeah yeah I I I like doing that as

3052.51 --> 3059.86
well five artists leave our Alice but it

3057.43 --> 3062.68
it's kind of difficult to talk about it

3059.86 --> 3068.4700000000003
as a separate subject that's almost like

3062.68 --> 3071.95
talking about the nature of math so I

3068.47 --> 3074.02
love to bring spiritual technical angles

3071.95 --> 3077.4399999999996
to it or relating to psychology and

3074.02 --> 3079.48
spirit energies in situations but it's

3077.44 --> 3082.27
always going to be added on to something

3079.48 --> 3084.54
it's very tough to just talk about it in

3082.27 --> 3084.54
general

3087.08 --> 3090.21
[Music]

3095.55 --> 3106.05
okay hm please go and take your mood

3100.08 --> 3110.18
somewhere else gave you plenty of

3106.05 --> 3110.1800000000003
warning it's getting really annoying

3112.79 --> 3117.15
no batch batch

3114.78 --> 3120.86
I don't try ayahuasca it's not even

3117.15 --> 3120.86
legal here okay

3138.4 --> 3143.52
I have enough experience to go for a

3142.21 --> 3146.26
lifetime

3143.52 --> 3150.43
although yeah I have considered that at

3146.26 --> 3155.4700000000003
some point I might actually be strong

3150.43 --> 3158.08
enough to try to figure some things out

3155.47 --> 3160.5699999999997
with it and maybe I can achieve

3158.08 --> 3164.35
something trying something out with it

3160.57 --> 3168.55
without ending up damaged previous time

3164.35 --> 3172.74
in the past so but I'm not really

3168.55 --> 3176.3700000000003
interested in trying anything like that

3172.74 --> 3176.37
at the moment

3178.51 --> 3181.7090000000003
[Music]

3183.99 --> 3187.12
[Music]

3191.94 --> 3194.6
turn

3196.98 --> 3199.58
that's

3200.23 --> 3203.23
interesting

3207.55 --> 3216.02
that's an interesting claim reading them

3212.33 --> 3218.7999999999997
of their ego really does ayahuasca do

3216.02 --> 3218.8
that really

3231.29 --> 3237.74
I don't know I've had quite different

3234.17 --> 3240.17
types of experience so but yeah to be

3237.74 --> 3244.18
fair I don't exactly know what they gave

3240.17 --> 3248.54
me even so wasn't informed about that I

3244.18 --> 3250.91
had they did mention some things but I

3248.54 --> 3260.75
had no idea what that even was at the

3250.91 --> 3261.98
time okay well if you say that and salt

3260.75 --> 3265.58
at six six seven

3261.98 --> 3268.9
I wouldn't be surprised that you would

3265.58 --> 3272.0
lose your desire for power because I

3268.9 --> 3274.61
probably yeah I can remember several

3272.0 --> 3276.98
times where that basically happened to

3274.61 --> 3281.0
me and I don't really have desire for

3276.98 --> 3285.79
power at all I'm actually more afraid of

3281.0 --> 3285.79
it than that I desire it although I do

3287.41 --> 3293.2999999999997
there are things that I want to do and I

3291.35 --> 3294.74
know that you need some measure of power

3293.3 --> 3298.01
and control to it

3294.74 --> 3302.5899999999997
just to be able to achieve that but I'm

3298.01 --> 3305.8
not like in a rush to just get power

3302.59 --> 3305.8
absolutely not

3306.87 --> 3311.5099999999998
I'd rather have power over myself and

3311.81 --> 3317.79
yeah show how that works so that other

3314.61 --> 3322.86
people might be getting more power over

3317.79 --> 3326.04
themselves and that way make the world

3322.86 --> 3328.44
better including for myself and well for

3326.04 --> 3335.73
the future or any offspring I may

3328.44 --> 3338.76
conceive at some point so you could

3335.73 --> 3342.93
technically call that power but I'd call

3338.76 --> 3347.5400000000004
that power of logos that's the just the

3342.93 --> 3347.54
best way to do it in my opinion

3353.88 --> 3356.88
yeah

3358.17 --> 3360.83
yeah

3362.63 --> 3368.92
but Chris Matt though nobody has to tell

3365.33 --> 3372.0099999999998
me not to take it or to take it because

3368.92 --> 3376.39
when it comes to that kind of stuff

3372.01 --> 3376.3900000000003
nobody's gonna tell me what to do

3383.7 --> 3386.7799999999997
good yeah

3387.67 --> 3390.7690000000002
[Music]

3392.89 --> 3400.15
but I'm not gonna seek it out you know

3395.589 --> 3405.43
oh look my normal freaking brain

3400.15 --> 3408.73
activity like dudes everyone here like I

3405.43 --> 3412.5989999999997
have a show right doing internet YouTube

3408.73 --> 3419.259
stuff for three years at least I think

3412.599 --> 3425.759
now I haven't taken any any type of

3419.259 --> 3429.67
drugs any besides well cannabis coffee

3425.759 --> 3433.329
and alcohol that's it that's like the

3429.67 --> 3435.579
only real anything you could even call

3433.329 --> 3441.9100000000003
drugs that I've taken in all this time

3435.579 --> 3445.3590000000004
and yeah yet skills have come up unique

3441.91 --> 3448.44
ideas connections insight in the moment

3445.359 --> 3450.64
explanations and solutions for

3448.44 --> 3454.18
miscommunications all of that is still

3450.64 --> 3457.8689999999997
achieved so why would I even need to

3454.18 --> 3459.819
like open my mind which that basically

3457.869 --> 3463.539
would do why would I need to do that

3459.819 --> 3467.0389999999998
when it's already well it seems to be

3463.539 --> 3467.039
damn well open doesn't it

3476.48 --> 3479.05
all right

3485.46 --> 3494.369
peanuts Clark well yeah drugs are

3491.569 --> 3498.839
they're not really bad not all of them

3494.369 --> 3501.51
but it's if you'd have make a choice

3498.839 --> 3504.23
it's always it usually turns out to be

3501.51 --> 3508.26
better not to use it than to use it

3504.23 --> 3511.829
unless yeah or to like never start it

3508.26 --> 3514.44
then to become a user it's usually a

3511.829 --> 3519.51
disadvantage but that doesn't mean that

3514.44 --> 3522.69
there aren't things you can achieve also

3519.51 --> 3527.6400000000003
with some form of assistance induced by

3522.69 --> 3531.9
drugs which could be helped with focus

3527.64 --> 3533.97
for example or tension like essential

3531.9 --> 3536.609
tension relief ability that you would

3533.97 --> 3539.819
normally not be able to achieve so it's

3536.609 --> 3542.96
not like it's completely useless but on

3539.819 --> 3546.599
the long run getting used to using drugs

3542.96 --> 3549.66
usually turns out to be worse than never

3546.599 --> 3552.4700000000003
having started them at all I have to be

3549.66 --> 3555.7799999999997
honest about that now on the other hand

3552.47 --> 3558.839
there are still the Kadim cannabinoid

3555.78 --> 3562.28
receptors in our genetics that's just

3558.839 --> 3566.089
there it's proven so to completely

3562.28 --> 3573.299
exclude any type of cannabinoid product

3566.089 --> 3575.16
that does not yield benefit but yeah it

3573.299 --> 3578.16
would definitely look if you compare it

3575.16 --> 3580.95
the to a person that just smokes

3578.16 --> 3583.5
cannabis and a person that doesn't smoke

3580.95 --> 3587.27
cannabis or anything but that does take

3583.5 --> 3591.39
cannabis oil or sell any anything but

3587.27 --> 3594.69
smoking it you can pretty much guarantee

3591.39 --> 3597.7799999999997
that the smoker is going to have more

3594.69 --> 3599.609
health problems on average than the

3597.78 --> 3603.0890000000004
nonsmoker that takes the cannabis oil

3599.609 --> 3606.0789999999997
and I'm pretty sure that we can agree on

3603.089 --> 3606.0789999999997
that that's a fact

3608.56 --> 3614.39
even though the smoker may have a lot of

3611.15 --> 3615.26
just fun and goofy times and wild

3614.39 --> 3619.0699999999997
inspirations

3615.26 --> 3622.1000000000004
you know but yeah that's something else

3619.07 --> 3625.52
so drugs in general I do regard them as

3622.1 --> 3629.39
bad it's I don't know it's it's kind of

3625.52 --> 3631.85
a method a methodology that I kind of

3629.39 --> 3635.5099999999998
apply it's the same for example in a bit

3631.85 --> 3638.5699999999997
sensitive area abortion like abortion is

3635.51 --> 3643.34
bad but does that mean you should

3638.57 --> 3647.9900000000002
completely forbid it with punishment and

3643.34 --> 3652.2200000000003
[ __ ] I don't agree with that but it

3647.99 --> 3655.1299999999997
should never be made or culturally

3652.22 --> 3658.81
turned into or promoted as good that

3655.13 --> 3662.57
should never be and that is the method

3658.81 --> 3665.2599999999998
for me tolerance does not mean

3662.57 --> 3665.26
acceptance

3680.42 --> 3689.849
all right so yeah I don't know look I

3686.43 --> 3692.3689999999997
just got caught up in using drugs and to

3689.849 --> 3695.19
be fair there are two reasons that I

3692.369 --> 3699.21
figured out why I've done that why I got

3695.19 --> 3703.26
into that in the first place and those

3699.21 --> 3705.48
two reasons were one for some reason it

3703.26 --> 3710.4300000000003
was in a period when I was just a young

3705.48 --> 3713.76
teenager basically and I never had the

3710.43 --> 3716.52
startup effect of just getting into

3713.76 --> 3719.57
group social maneuvering and it never

3716.52 --> 3721.71
really worked but for some reason just

3719.57 --> 3726.48
even the first time when I smoked

3721.71 --> 3729.359
cannabis it actually made that happen

3726.48 --> 3732.72
and suddenly people that I barely knew I

3729.359 --> 3735.99
got into great conversations and adapted

3732.72 --> 3739.7999999999997
really well naturally and that kind of

3735.99 --> 3742.91
is I'm still doing it according to how

3739.8 --> 3746.82
that happened cannabis opened me up

3742.91 --> 3749.0699999999997
maybe it kind of repaired me from early

3746.82 --> 3751.619
vaccine damage because I did get a

3749.07 --> 3754.32
couple of vaccines and I think that they

3751.619 --> 3758.6400000000003
did probably have negative influence

3754.32 --> 3761.55
because I am so sensitive yeah probably

3758.64 --> 3764.25
did cause some brain damage up to a

3761.55 --> 3766.44
certain point but I think that I pretty

3764.25 --> 3769.619
much restored most of it and bypass it

3766.44 --> 3772.589
but it has been taken going slow because

3769.619 --> 3779.82
of this so yeah I smoked it I certainly

3772.589 --> 3784.22
was able to connect through it and at

3779.82 --> 3784.2200000000003
the same time yeah that happened

3784.81 --> 3791.24
and it's hard to step away from that

3787.45 --> 3793.5499999999997
because I had missed that ability to

3791.24 --> 3796.7299999999996
socially connect so much I was so

3793.55 --> 3798.71
isolated basically before that always

3796.73 --> 3801.13
did the single person never really

3798.71 --> 3805.43
talking with anyone except for other

3801.13 --> 3809.4500000000003
outcast types I was among the outcasts

3805.43 --> 3814.5499999999997
every time and that's not fun I can tell

3809.45 --> 3818.0299999999997
you but I sought it out it was just I

3814.55 --> 3820.07
didn't feel any other place but when I

3818.03 --> 3822.98
started to smoke that changed and also

3820.07 --> 3826.7000000000003
my relations with the outcast group at

3822.98 --> 3830.57
the time also changed and I felt like no

3826.7 --> 3834.95
I'm finally free of that [ __ ] I don't

3830.57 --> 3837.3500000000004
want to be that that type of person

3834.95 --> 3845.12
anymore and yeah but because of it I I

3837.35 --> 3848.17
pretty much became a cannabis addict you

3845.12 --> 3848.17
know God really

3853.369 --> 3862.46
oh [ __ ] elderly men yeah okay well

3859.729 --> 3864.5789999999997
peanuts Clark that's a very very loaded

3862.46 --> 3867.89
questions

3864.579 --> 3870.1090000000004
an elderly man got arrested in my town

3867.89 --> 3872.5989999999997
for getting at the 13 year old pregnant

3870.109 --> 3878.509
though she half the baby is abortion

3872.599 --> 3881.059
wrongly well that's a hugely loaded

3878.509 --> 3885.92
question so I'm gonna try to answer it

3881.059 --> 3888.71
because I have to in my own opinion but

3885.92 --> 3893.259
I hope I don't stumble around too much

3888.71 --> 3897.739
because it's so loaded the it depends

3893.259 --> 3901.729
did the did the thirteen-year-old at

3897.739 --> 3903.65
least didn't she experienced it as rape

3901.729 --> 3906.68
let's just say it like that because

3903.65 --> 3909.559
that's like it can happen that type of

3906.68 --> 3911.359
relation it just like an aberration and

3909.559 --> 3913.969
she could have just like be like yeah I

3911.359 --> 3915.95
am gonna basically pretend to be a woman

3913.969 --> 3919.309
enough of a normal kind of normal

3915.95 --> 3921.529
relationship with an older man but if it

3919.309 --> 3923.299
was like yeah that she was locked up in

3921.529 --> 3925.279
his basement and he just freakin raped

3923.299 --> 3927.68
her well that's another matter

3925.279 --> 3930.38
you know then it's the conception is not

3927.68 --> 3932.5389999999998
out of love even though it's wrong love

3930.38 --> 3935.089
you could say your fault or forbidden

3932.539 --> 3937.279
love but it would be out of rape if

3935.089 --> 3941.0589999999997
abortion yeah I think that abortion out

3937.279 --> 3943.309
of rape probably and definitely it's up

3941.059 --> 3947.509
to the female that they wouldn't want

3943.309 --> 3949.759
the kid but if it's out of love look and

3947.509 --> 3956.18
I'm gonna get really really complicated

3949.759 --> 3958.21
for a moment but really young girls tend

3956.18 --> 3961.279
to when they have kids

3958.21 --> 3965.21
whether that be tolerated by the society

3961.279 --> 3968.18
or whether it's like accidental they

3965.21 --> 3971.15
tend to get really healthy children the

3968.18 --> 3973.46
only real issue practically every time

3971.15 --> 3975.38
is that yeah when you're really young

3973.46 --> 3978.0190000000002
mother they don't have any good

3975.38 --> 3979.6400000000003
experience and if they're not basically

3978.019 --> 3981.2889999999998
guided by their own mothers in the

3979.64 --> 3984.6189999999997
process and then you get like a three

3981.289 --> 3986.309
step family with young mothers sometimes

3984.619 --> 3988.049
it typically happens that

3986.309 --> 3990.029
every time they get pregnant really

3988.049 --> 3996.299
young because it's just it is the way

3990.029 --> 3999.42
they work but ya know an abortion for a

3996.299 --> 4001.249
13 year old not necessarily absolutely

3999.42 --> 4006.38
it should never be mandated at least

4001.249 --> 4008.209
you'd always be up up to the yeah the

4006.38 --> 4010.759
recipients the one that carrying the

4008.209 --> 4013.189
child even I think or the parents in

4010.759 --> 4022.13
this case it's it's very complicated

4013.189 --> 4025.699
again but yeah it depends like it was

4022.13 --> 4029.9
the 13 year old also like using drugs or

4025.699 --> 4031.849
very unhealthy or tortured because all

4029.9 --> 4033.92
of that's gonna negatively influence it

4031.849 --> 4035.9590000000003
but if it was basically like yeah

4033.92 --> 4039.89
forbidden love accident kind of

4035.959 --> 4041.8689999999997
situation then yeah it would be awkward

4039.89 --> 4043.819
for a thirteen-year-old that will be

4041.869 --> 4047.119
probably 14 or something to have a kid

4043.819 --> 4051.64
it would definitely be awkward but the

4047.119 --> 4054.799
kid might be very healthy it all depends

4051.64 --> 4057.339
so no there's no straightforward answer

4054.799 --> 4057.339
to that really

4075.57 --> 4086.4
all right well I am NOT for mandated

4082.32 --> 4092.4900000000002
abortion if the pregnant female is is

4086.4 --> 4094.29
like really young you know that I don't

4092.49 --> 4097.23
think it should that I definitely should

4094.29 --> 4102.51
not be mandated but you shouldn't force

4097.23 --> 4106.219999999999
it but you cannot abort it either that's

4102.51 --> 4106.22
how I see it really to be honest

4120.679 --> 4130.109
anyway nice thanks for the loaded

4123.929 --> 4136.5
question I see people have already moved

4130.109 --> 4140.63
on and chat to something else talking

4136.5 --> 4140.63
about Crohn's disease what

4148.349 --> 4154.04
right

4150.199 --> 4157.0599999999995
yeah yes look smoking cannabis but also

4154.04 --> 4163.089
especially smoking tobacco has some

4157.06 --> 4165.620000000001
negative potentially negative or like

4163.089 --> 4172.25
has side effects on the metabolism

4165.62 --> 4175.3099999999995
definitely that will wear on your

4172.25 --> 4178.46
metabolism over the time over time so it

4175.31 --> 4181.819
will digress the overall situation if

4178.46 --> 4185.929
you keep on smoking and smoking and I've

4181.819 --> 4191.54
even experienced that so sometimes I

4185.929 --> 4195.7300000000005
wonder should I like try to just cut out

4191.54 --> 4195.73
tobacco out of my system for a while

4199.69 --> 4211.08
or even just tried to stop smoking

4202.96 --> 4211.08
entirely just call my buddy down

4245.19 --> 4254.28
holy [ __ ] smoking for 50 years my god

4250.48 --> 4254.28
that's a long long time

4267.81 --> 4270.859
[Music]

4288.559 --> 4299.3
hmm yep fresh FETs vegetables and fruit

4295.75 --> 4305.719
organic as fresh as possible that's

4299.3 --> 4309.7300000000005
definitely good for you I I try not to

4305.719 --> 4312.13
forget to eat vegetables every day

4309.73 --> 4315.23
weirdly enough yesterday I completely

4312.13 --> 4317.09
forgot it because I started to drink

4315.23 --> 4320.509999999999
beers I had a bunch of chips because

4317.09 --> 4324.079
they were discounted 50% and I just felt

4320.51 --> 4327.5
like it and then yeah the internet went

4324.079 --> 4328.82
dead and I was bummed out and it just

4327.5 --> 4331.67
went to bed really early actually

4328.82 --> 4333.44
without having dinner so I didn't eat

4331.67 --> 4335.63
any vegetables yesterday I can tell you

4333.44 --> 4342.5199999999995
that my body this morning did not like

4335.63 --> 4342.52
that at all so yes

4363.219 --> 4370.19
all right laughing extends your lifespan

4368.06 --> 4372.8
well technically what it does is that

4370.19 --> 4375.799999999999
its statistic alright that's what that's

4372.8 --> 4379.360000000001
how that's determined than what it is is

4375.8 --> 4381.7390000000005
that people that just know how to love

4379.36 --> 4384.98
and especially the ones that really

4381.739 --> 4389.089999999999
enjoy it they will not have to deal with

4384.98 --> 4394.19
the the strain of the stress as much as

4389.09 --> 4395.900000000001
people that don't laugh a lot and if you

4394.19 --> 4397.699
even it out with people that live

4395.9 --> 4400.61
high-pressure lives and people that live

4397.699 --> 4402.83
low-pressure lives especially with the

4400.61 --> 4404.719
high-pressure life if they don't know

4402.83 --> 4407.3
how to properly release their tension

4404.719 --> 4412.46
laughing then they will absolutely

4407.3 --> 4416.71
suffer under it so in that sense yes the

4412.46 --> 4419.3
ability to laugh can save your life

4416.71 --> 4422.05
because if you couldn't then stress

4419.3 --> 4422.05
could kill you

4422.07 --> 4425.5199999999995
[Music]

4428.079 --> 4434.5199999999995
but that doesn't mean that the ability

4431.679 --> 4438.309
to laugh about things will always

4434.52 --> 4440.349
relieve all the stress necessary because

4438.309 --> 4443.349
at some point when you laugh about

4440.349 --> 4445.75
misery that kind of works you kind of

4443.349 --> 4447.6990000000005
make fun of it and then you move on but

4445.75 --> 4451.0
eventually if it just keeps staring you

4447.699 --> 4453.638999999999
in the face eventually it'll lose the

4451.0 --> 4454.659
ability to laugh about it's just not

4453.639 --> 4458.349
funny anymore

4454.659 --> 4462.929
if it just keeps on staring you in the

4458.349 --> 4462.929
face so that only works for so long

4467.719 --> 4478.219
so yeah comedy is not a guarantee and

4474.86 --> 4483.5
even like really big comedians have

4478.219 --> 4486.53
issues with that as well because they

4483.5 --> 4494.21
get a lot of strain as well and they're

4486.53 --> 4496.91
basically forced to use it to seek it

4494.21 --> 4499.04
out in order to achieve comedy and that

4496.91 --> 4503.449
can be very strained for as well because

4499.04 --> 4505.1
everybody may laugh about it and the

4503.449 --> 4507.23
person might be able to laugh a little

4505.1 --> 4509.27
bit about it themselves but at the same

4507.23 --> 4511.4
time they do feel a certain pressure of

4509.27 --> 4513.650000000001
what they have to deal with in the

4511.4 --> 4515.989
background concerning it but if they

4513.65 --> 4519.0199999999995
show that then it kind of dampens the

4515.989 --> 4523.968999999999
effect of the comedy so they have to

4519.02 --> 4525.68
hold back and that is very stressful if

4523.969 --> 4530.59
they're like really strong comedians

4525.68 --> 4537.1990000000005
that seek out yeah

4530.59 --> 4538.969
dangerous subjects so that happens but

4537.199 --> 4542.299999999999
then again a comedian is not the same

4538.969 --> 4544.1
thing as somebody laughing being a bit

4542.3 --> 4547.9400000000005
able to laugh about things

4544.1 --> 4550.51
oh hey Thank You South bean for the $5

4547.94 --> 4553.46
super chair donation much appreciated

4550.51 --> 4557.27
thanks

4553.46 --> 4557.27
[Music]

4562.14 --> 4565.829000000001
[Music]

4566.19 --> 4573.4
right so hey if anybody wants to join I

4570.61 --> 4577.599999999999
could yeah I've been going for an hour

4573.4 --> 4581.049999999999
and 20 minutes roughly 1 hour 15 I could

4577.6 --> 4583.18
technically go on for a long time but

4581.05 --> 4585.01
I'm not gonna do that without people on

4583.18 --> 4586.87
the panel but because I'm not just gonna

4585.01 --> 4588.79
be sitting here talking for three hours

4586.87 --> 4592.48
straight or something that's just too

4588.79 --> 4595.86
much to ask for but if somebody wants to

4592.48 --> 4601.2699999999995
get on talk or maybe multiple people

4595.86 --> 4606.03
yeah I offer my platform for just that

4601.27 --> 4608.2300000000005
can be about anything gonna be about

4606.03 --> 4612.45
subjects we discussed about in this

4608.23 --> 4612.45
hangout earlier whatever you like but

4612.66 --> 4617.8
you're gonna have to call in through

4614.98 --> 4620.549999999999
skype though or let me know in Skype and

4617.8 --> 4620.55
I'll call you in

4643.98 --> 4657.45
ah oh look at that see see how intense

4651.989 --> 4659.639999999999
that Sun is it's really it is middle

4657.45 --> 4663.63
often it's like midsummer now pretty

4659.64 --> 4667.29
much and it's noticeable I also noticed

4663.63 --> 4670.53
and that was really weird it was two

4667.29 --> 4676.94
days ago and it was up extremely late

4670.53 --> 4680.849999999999
and it was like 3:30 at night here and

4676.94 --> 4688.0199999999995
for some reason I could see the daylight

4680.85 --> 4692.280000000001
at the edge 3:30 but it just was this

4688.02 --> 4695.96
tiny little bluish layer and above it

4692.28 --> 4702.87
black and stars I saw this layer 3:30

4695.96 --> 4706.29
already's from the Sun I I've never seen

4702.87 --> 4710.22
it during that time and also the Sun

4706.29 --> 4715.0199999999995
Goes Down really late or rather the Sun

4710.22 --> 4718.47
itself may go beyond sight the the

4715.02 --> 4720.9890000000005
lightt disc it goes out of sight at some

4718.47 --> 4725.1900000000005
point but before it actually becomes

4720.989 --> 4727.7699999999995
completely 100% dark it takes a long

4725.19 --> 4729.12
time and again for some reason now

4727.77 --> 4733.38
during this midsummer

4729.12 --> 4737.55
in the morning or idiotically early 3:30

4733.38 --> 4738.63
you already see the shimmer and in the

4737.55 --> 4742.38
late evening

4738.63 --> 4744.900000000001
you should also still see the remnant of

4742.38 --> 4748.35
the Sun going away or however you

4744.9 --> 4749.25
conceptualize it very long after the Sun

4748.35 --> 4751.4400000000005
has gone down

4749.25 --> 4754.26
that's something I've taken a note of

4751.44 --> 4759.44
have you guys noticed this in the

4754.26 --> 4762.21
northern north of the Equator everyone

4759.44 --> 4766.259999999999
like try to see if you can catch it at

4762.21 --> 4771.75
these unusual times like incredibly

4766.26 --> 4775.25
early and you still see remnant of the

4771.75 --> 4780.06
daylight incredibly late

4775.25 --> 4783.81
like I think like half-past 10:00 at

4780.06 --> 4786.63
night or in the evening you still see

4783.81 --> 4790.02
some remnant of the Sun or even like 11

4786.63 --> 4793.05
o'clock so incredibly late and then in

4790.02 --> 4795.39
the morning of the insane 3:30 you see

4793.05 --> 4797.55
the glow the Morning Glory already how

4795.39 --> 4802.37
is that even possible how is that balls

4797.55 --> 4809.4490000000005
that suppose the Sun have gone around

4802.37 --> 4809.449
and such a short time it's so weird

4809.66 --> 4816.68
[Music]

4823.31 --> 4827.080000000001
what do you guys think about this

4830.29 --> 4833.58
they're her stilt

4843.91 --> 4853.43
yeah really but no but I'm not even

4850.73 --> 4856.459999999999
talking about the Sun disk I'm talking

4853.43 --> 4858.8
about the Morning Glory when the Sun

4856.46 --> 4860.89
starts to shimmer at the horizon when

4858.8 --> 4865.49
everything's pretty much still black and

4860.89 --> 4869.54
I saw that at 3:30 at night and I saw

4865.49 --> 4874.87
the last light strip of the Sun down at

4869.54 --> 4879.53
like 10:30 or 11 o'clock in the evening

4874.87 --> 4880.96
before that so I don't know if you guys

4879.53 --> 4888.53
have seen that as well

4880.96 --> 4891.47
it's so bizarre how close the yeah the

4888.53 --> 4896.469999999999
the sunlight the morning glory and the

4891.47 --> 4896.47
evening shimmer follow each other up

4900.28 --> 4905.33
yeah the real early summer morning it's

4903.47 --> 4908.84
incredible the energy that's in the air

4905.33 --> 4910.94
is just riveting because it's still very

4908.84 --> 4915.02
cool but the energy is already like

4910.94 --> 4918.049999999999
coming in and you like like the birds go

4915.02 --> 4921.38
nuts with that type of energy in

4918.05 --> 4922.7
midsummer in the early morning and then

4921.38 --> 4924.95
the rest of the day yeah they usually

4922.7 --> 4930.97
get a little warm and just hang around

4924.95 --> 4930.97
or like go seek out water a lot

4944.599 --> 4949.82
that's funny yeah that's right unsalted

4947.21 --> 4953.889
the light does not come from the Sun Sun

4949.82 --> 4956.09
is a focal point of the light well a

4953.889 --> 4958.13
focal point of the light that would

4956.09 --> 4963.349
suggest it even being a point it's I

4958.13 --> 4966.8
would rather describe it as yeah an

4963.349 --> 4968.84
apparition at the focal point of the

4966.8 --> 4974.63
daylight direction in relation to the

4968.84 --> 4978.079
observer like a bunch of beams coming in

4974.63 --> 4981.139
from that apparent locations and then an

4978.079 --> 4982.4
apparition of the Sun disc is seen at

4981.139 --> 4987.86
the epicenter of it

4982.4 --> 4990.469
I don't give a fleeting [ __ ] what

4987.86 --> 4992.589999999999
Antonia thinks I came up with this [ __ ]

4990.469 --> 4996.67
three years ago

4992.59 --> 4999.139
holographic Sun way before he was even

4996.67 --> 5002.139
muddying around with what I don't give a

4999.139 --> 5003.9400000000005
[ __ ] when he says he's a robber he he

5002.139 --> 5005.889
steals intellectual people's

5003.94 --> 5009.25
intellectual property and claims he

5005.889 --> 5012.159000000001
invented it he's a filthy vile

5009.25 --> 5014.88
individual and I want no association

5012.159 --> 5014.879999999999
whatsoever

5027.96 --> 5030.96
okay

5049.18 --> 5051.900000000001
all right

5058.35 --> 5064.77
besides if you really yeah I already

5062.64 --> 5067.35
know this I don't even have to freakin

5064.77 --> 5070.35
watch Antonio's videos talking him

5067.35 --> 5072.54
hearing him talk about it but he could

5070.35 --> 5076.02
never explain it even to the level that

5072.54 --> 5080.9
I do and he is supposed to prime

5076.02 --> 5083.64
language he's just ripping people off

5080.9 --> 5089.429999999999
trying to pretend he's the old wise

5083.64 --> 5093.0
wizard meanwhile [ __ ] on everybody

5089.43 --> 5095.93
else no I definitely don't care if you

5093.0 --> 5095.93
agrees with me or not

5108.54 --> 5116.38
yeah no I'm not reading that freaking

5111.49 --> 5118.75
book not gonna do it I'm not gonna waste

5116.38 --> 5121.81
money that I really don't have on that

5118.75 --> 5125.02
[ __ ] thank you very much it's really

5121.81 --> 5126.9400000000005
nice that he wrote a book I'm not gonna

5125.02 --> 5133.39
write a book probably or maybe I will

5126.94 --> 5138.15
eventually but I don't know I I just

5133.39 --> 5142.6900000000005
don't don't see the point I could write

5138.15 --> 5144.879999999999
a story about reasoning about cosmogony

5142.69 --> 5151.96
reasoning and presuppositions make it a

5144.88 --> 5155.08
very technical thing I don't know but

5151.96 --> 5157.15
I'm more interested really in trying to

5155.08 --> 5160.18
figure it out as I go and making it a

5157.15 --> 5161.37
verbal thing because books were never

5160.18 --> 5166.240000000001
really my thing

5161.37 --> 5169.87
no I find books very handy to basically

5166.24 --> 5171.73
store data like for example with my D&D

5169.87 --> 5174.19
work all the technical work it's really

5171.73 --> 5175.87
handy to have it in book form because

5174.19 --> 5180.5199999999995
it's basically a library of a lot of

5175.87 --> 5186.21
technical stuff but as for putting down

5180.52 --> 5186.21
a story I've I don't know

5187.79 --> 5195.29
I am afraid it would just turn out to

5191.99 --> 5199.61
become a very small book because I don't

5195.29 --> 5204.56
like to really ramble on like I don't

5199.61 --> 5212.36
like to pander the story I'd like to be

5204.56 --> 5216.530000000001
extremely concise yeah and I don't know

5212.36 --> 5218.839999999999
if it's gonna work look if this

5216.53 --> 5220.969999999999
everything works out the way it does I

5218.84 --> 5222.53
feel that eventually if I'm gonna be

5220.97 --> 5224.4800000000005
writing a book it's probably just gonna

5222.53 --> 5228.86
be pushed on me it's like yeah you are

5224.48 --> 5232.099999999999
gonna write a book and we'll help you or

5228.86 --> 5233.99
something or maybe just nobody really

5232.1 --> 5235.79
cares at some point about the books

5233.99 --> 5237.679999999999
anymore because the markets gonna be

5235.79 --> 5239.54
spammed with all kinds of projects of

5237.68 --> 5241.37
hundreds of people that all disagree

5239.54 --> 5243.47
with each other and everyone makes

5241.37 --> 5248.03
mistakes about a lot of things and

5243.47 --> 5251.56
there's more stuff going I don't know I

5248.03 --> 5251.5599999999995
have no idea where it's going

5266.59 --> 5272.26
yeah I don't know it's just not my

5269.17 --> 5273.4
priorities like when I started up this

5272.26 --> 5276.7
Flat Earth channel

5273.4 --> 5279.58
I never thought like oh yeah man I have

5276.7 --> 5286.09
to make sure that I get material ready

5279.58 --> 5290.2
together to publish a book nope that was

5286.09 --> 5295.110000000001
never about that I really just wanted to

5290.2 --> 5298.389999999999
train my own personal verbal skill

5295.11 --> 5303.94
develop myself and get into the subject

5298.39 --> 5306.88
and really make a lore out of it a

5303.94 --> 5308.86
technical or cosmic Genie and really get

5306.88 --> 5311.5
onto that I was on that very early on

5308.86 --> 5312.849999999999
never really jumped on a singular model

5311.5 --> 5316.45
can always work and presuppose

5312.85 --> 5319.06
everything as I have with ballers with

5316.45 --> 5323.05
flat earthers with other specific ideas

5319.06 --> 5325.3
and I can do that and I like doing that

5323.05 --> 5327.33
and it was never really about writing a

5325.3 --> 5327.33
book

5328.29 --> 5336.66
although yeah you know what were I able

5333.22 --> 5340.09
to survive let's say the next 30 years

5336.66 --> 5342.67
if our we are able to do that maybe it's

5340.09 --> 5345.7
gonna be actually really easy maybe it's

5342.67 --> 5347.71
not gonna be that easy but who knows but

5345.7 --> 5349.9
maybe after Wow it will definitely

5347.71 --> 5352.84
become worth it they're like write an

5349.9 --> 5356.2
autobiography I've already been talking

5352.84 --> 5358.4400000000005
so much about life and how that all

5356.2 --> 5361.389999999999
worked out there so much to fill in now

5358.44 --> 5363.129999999999
that I think that after a long time I'm

5361.39 --> 5366.0
probably even gonna be a lot clearer

5363.13 --> 5368.92
about it all and I could technically

5366.0 --> 5371.86
talk for like 12 hours straight about

5368.92 --> 5373.4800000000005
all that much more focused but nobody's

5371.86 --> 5375.3099999999995
gonna be listening 12 hours straight

5373.48 --> 5377.679999999999
time yeah and it's like if it like it I

5375.31 --> 5380.55
David I presentation about or wins life

5377.68 --> 5382.63
well goody I don't see that working

5380.55 --> 5384.91
maybe maybe I will

5382.63 --> 5386.26
I don't know 30 years you know I don't

5384.91 --> 5390.82
know how culture is even gonna be

5386.26 --> 5393.58
working at that point but maybe after a

5390.82 --> 5395.2
long time an autobiography will work out

5393.58 --> 5397.63
and I could make it into a pretty

5395.2 --> 5398.449
interesting to read book something like

5397.63 --> 5401.78
that but

5398.449 --> 5405.65
I'm not like oh oh I have to put my my

5401.78 --> 5407.96
little flag in the scape of Flat Earth

5405.65 --> 5409.33
so that everybody's gonna think that it

5407.96 --> 5414.05
was all about me

5409.33 --> 5421.3
no I I'm not gonna adhere to the sivan

5414.05 --> 5421.3
yay in me as a lot of other people have

5422.05 --> 5429.4400000000005
and that's why I generally don't attack

5424.94 --> 5431.66
people I criticize people I don't really

5429.44 --> 5436.5199999999995
attack them unless they're just freaking

5431.66 --> 5439.239
indecent trolls and I don't hold a

5436.52 --> 5439.2390000000005
grudge really

5458.699 --> 5467.759999999999
huh marks Rd is writing a book oh why

5463.26 --> 5471.51
not I'd be interested to read it very

5467.76 --> 5474.6
curious how he would write and the funny

5471.51 --> 5478.26
thing is I'm pretty sure it's not gonna

5474.6 --> 5480.6
be filled up with the shitty attacks on

5478.26 --> 5488.1900000000005
people so I think it's probably gonna be

5480.6 --> 5490.79
either a fun read or interesting I'd be

5488.19 --> 5494.15
interested to read mark sergeant's book

5490.79 --> 5494.15
when it's done

5499.61 --> 5505.41
Flat Earth Society really so he's gonna

5503.13 --> 5509.49
write about the Flat Earth Society like

5505.41 --> 5513.2699999999995
the pre Flat Earth 2050 awakening it's

5509.49 --> 5514.83
got right like a recent historical piece

5513.27 --> 5518.040000000001
is that gonna be it is that what is

5514.83 --> 5522.6
gonna make that's interesting it's like

5518.04 --> 5524.4
the prehistory that's cool then I'm

5522.6 --> 5527.900000000001
definitely gonna be interested to read

5524.4 --> 5527.9
what he has to say about that

5531.38 --> 5534.56
[Music]

5537.96 --> 5548.18
yes hm I think it's all pretty we all

5544.11 --> 5552.87
played blatantly know by now that the

5548.18 --> 5558.39
hypocritical nature of the leftists and

5552.87 --> 5559.89
their LBG literally all that stuff yeah

5558.39 --> 5563.96
they're two-faced we get it you don't

5559.89 --> 5563.96
have to capture please

5570.55 --> 5576.27
[Music]

5573.06 --> 5576.27
probably not

5587.369 --> 5594.719
all right but yeah if you want to know

5590.34 --> 5599.58
Brenda you know there's it's not nice if

5594.719 --> 5601.92
people go all nasty and like : Deidre we

5599.58 --> 5605.73
should get rid of them or something but

5601.92 --> 5611.52
there is also another group that kind of

5605.73 --> 5613.799999999999
does that very persistently so even even

5611.52 --> 5615.869000000001
though they move you know everybody

5613.8 --> 5618.9890000000005
tries to discuss with them but they

5615.869 --> 5620.5199999999995
persistently hold on to that no you

5618.989 --> 5622.709999999999
should definitely throw gays off

5620.52 --> 5624.3
buildings that's what they basically

5622.71 --> 5628.4
want to hold on you know what it is

5624.3 --> 5631.05
it's not Christian because Christians

5628.4 --> 5633.53
don't remember when the last time that

5631.05 --> 5638.4490000000005
Christians even did anything like that

5633.53 --> 5642.21
anywhere but I think that other group

5638.449 --> 5647.449
still kind of does that even to this day

5642.21 --> 5650.25
yet nobody in OBG did blue or the

5647.449 --> 5653.28
leftists or any corporate relation to

5650.25 --> 5656.61
that ever really talks about that or

5653.28 --> 5658.139
rather say like hmm yeah there may be a

5656.61 --> 5661.86
little issue with it

5658.139 --> 5665.55
I hope they change it maybe and that's

5661.86 --> 5668.159
it maybe not even that they were just

5665.55 --> 5672.2300000000005
probably not talking about it so that is

5668.159 --> 5675.629999999999
kind of super hypocritical that if a a

5672.23 --> 5678.209999999999
Christian of some kind priest might get

5675.63 --> 5680.82
a little bit sick of the [ __ ] we

5678.21 --> 5683.75
gotta get rid of them all that they

5680.82 --> 5686.19
would be attack well the other group

5683.75 --> 5689.9
literally incorporates that

5686.19 --> 5693.0
systematically and applies the violence

5689.9 --> 5694.259999999999
without regret and nobody would be

5693.0 --> 5697.31
talking about it's kind of hypocritical

5694.26 --> 5697.31
when you think

5709.619 --> 5714.75
yes peanuts Clark they have to use Skype

5712.26 --> 5719.219
I'm no longer applying Google Hangouts

5714.75 --> 5721.05
it doesn't work it's broken sound often

5719.219 --> 5722.969
just doesn't work can't hear each other

5721.05 --> 5725.88
that kind of [ __ ] not doing it anymore

5722.969 --> 5728.179
it's not that good anyway so Skype works

5725.88 --> 5728.179
fine

5751.929 --> 5758.6900000000005
okay really the Flat Earth Research

5756.11 --> 5769.28
Society building was burned I have a no

5758.69 --> 5771.23
idea that that even existed look I'll be

5769.28 --> 5773.33
sure to read all about it

5771.23 --> 5774.949
when Mark Sargeant finishes his book or

5773.33 --> 5778.909
when he does a video about it or

5774.949 --> 5781.96
whatever but I don't know anything about

5778.909 --> 5781.96
this at all

5797.84 --> 5804.04
it

5799.389 --> 5810.07
no no insulted no they are definitely

5804.04 --> 5813.2699999999995
not that that's I'm kind of disappointed

5810.07 --> 5813.2699999999995
that you should know better

5828.49 --> 5837.55
but seriously insulted like you should

5833.11 --> 5840.19
know that Iran is like one of the last

5837.55 --> 5846.1900000000005
few countries in the world that is not

5840.19 --> 5849.129999999999
in control of the banks of that specific

5846.19 --> 5853.87
target group that you're mentioning it

5849.13 --> 5858.36
isn't so they are definitely not that so

5853.87 --> 5858.36
you are just brutally mistaken my friend

5860.61 --> 5864.0599999999995
it's just silly

5865.41 --> 5869.62
you're making an ass out of yourself

5867.49 --> 5879.88
while saying that kind of [ __ ] it's just

5869.62 --> 5881.38
not true well it's all I should freaking

5879.88 --> 5885.66
time you out for this [ __ ] it's really

5881.38 --> 5885.66
annoying don't be a dumbass

5886.26 --> 5893.2300000000005
you know what Saul control a position

5889.05 --> 5895.39
yourself the biggest controlled

5893.23 --> 5899.65
opposition you ever experienced your

5895.39 --> 5901.780000000001
entire lifetime is you because you're

5899.65 --> 5905.049999999999
the one that's making up these paranoid

5901.78 --> 5907.179999999999
ideas to lock everything out and not

5905.05 --> 5908.47
actually looking into the details and

5907.18 --> 5913.12
then when somebody points that out

5908.47 --> 5916.96
you're suddenly all blood so yeah that

5913.12 --> 5919.57
it's oh that's literally wiping clean

5916.96 --> 5922.36
the information slate so you don't look

5919.57 --> 5929.4
at the details and that's [ __ ]

5922.36 --> 5929.4
that's a [ __ ] act think about it

5929.97 --> 5935.320000000001
all right and apparently in researching

5933.64 --> 5938.04
all of this stuff you haven't really

5935.32 --> 5941.38
kept track of the details because you're

5938.04 --> 5944.95
blatantly over generalizing and making

5941.38 --> 5947.77
brutal assumption mistakes that I've

5944.95 --> 5950.98
just laid out to you so that weight of

5947.77 --> 5952.570000000001
the decades of research law doesn't hold

5950.98 --> 5957.0599999999995
much weight like that if you're gonna

5952.57 --> 5962.38
get such facts so blatantly wrong sorry

5957.06 --> 5965.02
get back to studying I don't need to

5962.38 --> 5975.82
look at it I got the information and you

5965.02 --> 5977.860000000001
got it wrong I got my sources as well I

5975.82 --> 5984.99
pick up on things as well and you're

5977.86 --> 5984.99
wrong or please provide the evidence

5985.23 --> 5990.429999999999
like the literal evidence and not some

5988.06 --> 5993.04
story red hair and [ __ ] surrounding it

5990.43 --> 5996.280000000001
that implies oh it's very similar so it

5993.04 --> 5999.06
must be that like like it's gravity or

5996.28 --> 6004.05
something okay I want some actual proof

5999.06 --> 6006.360000000001
right and I'm pretty sure you're not

6004.05 --> 6007.17
gonna find it because it doesn't make

6006.36 --> 6010.74
any sense

6007.17 --> 6014.79
because if they were then they'd not be

6010.74 --> 6018.179999999999
a target right now they wouldn't be a

6014.79 --> 6021.24
geopolitical target for yeah Israel or

6018.18 --> 6024.08
the United States or any anyone it's

6021.24 --> 6024.08
just not true

6029.15 --> 6034.379999999999
no that's right you didn't say that it

6032.369 --> 6037.348999999999
is very similar you just outright

6034.38 --> 6045.77
declared it's this and it's not you're

6037.349 --> 6045.77
wrong oh really

6045.86 --> 6053.119
really I figure that out one way or the

6051.09 --> 6057.4490000000005
other now won't we

6053.119 --> 6061.32
right because nothing in the world ever

6057.449 --> 6063.2699999999995
happens naturally there's no real

6061.32 --> 6066.299999999999
opposition everything is controlled it's

6063.27 --> 6069.030000000001
all just a play it's all fake everyone

6066.3 --> 6072.139
is actors nothing is real not even you

6069.03 --> 6074.61
but you still believe that you are real

6072.139 --> 6077.309
because that's just natural

6074.61 --> 6084.409
but you're not real either even you are

6077.309 --> 6084.409000000001
fake right get out here

6110.73 --> 6118.33
yeah I know room Thorsen I know about

6115.3 --> 6120.49
Mossadegh I know what happened I know it

6118.33 --> 6123.22
it was on the Alex Jones Show I've been

6120.49 --> 6124.75
pretty much ingrained with all of that

6123.22 --> 6133.150000000001
that's very nice

6124.75 --> 6136.98
it doesn't make them you know what to

6133.15 --> 6141.839999999999
suggest that is totally [ __ ] Iran

6136.98 --> 6145.679999999999
does not have a membership of the

6141.84 --> 6153.81
international banking system it does not

6145.68 --> 6153.81
it's stupid to say that it's really dumb

6157.34 --> 6172.610000000001
ah right so I guess nobody's joining so

6170.0 --> 6177.68
I think I'm gonna probably and end the

6172.61 --> 6182.71
show somewhere well I am getting kind of

6177.68 --> 6182.71
hungry as well that's a good sign

6192.189 --> 6194.76
No

6195.139 --> 6201.05
look the thing is about all of it

6198.409 --> 6203.69
why they did that what the CIA does why

6201.05 --> 6206.6
they overthrow countries look every time

6203.69 --> 6208.61
they see I literally blade in here okay

6206.6 --> 6210.77
every time the CIA does something to

6208.61 --> 6214.82
another country it doesn't turn the

6210.77 --> 6218.780000000001
country into Jews it's absolutely a

6214.82 --> 6222.32
[ __ ] notion but definitely the

6218.78 --> 6224.869
Israeli intelligence is trying to also

6222.32 --> 6227.54
abuse situations to do get a grip on it

6224.869 --> 6228.739
and try to reinforce like over are

6227.54 --> 6233.11
you're going to be part of the World

6228.739 --> 6235.759999999999
Bank that's always part of it off every

6233.11 --> 6237.5599999999995
transition that happens but that doesn't

6235.76 --> 6240.139
mean that everything turns into Jews

6237.56 --> 6244.04
every time a country is overthrown it

6240.139 --> 6244.7300000000005
only happens if that country allows that

6244.04 --> 6251.949
to happen

6244.73 --> 6256.839999999999
and Iran did not allow that to happen so

6251.949 --> 6256.839999999999
stop it please please

6264.639 --> 6273.79
no no peanuts Clark when Alex says China

6267.52 --> 6276.369000000001
that does not mean Israel I think Alex

6273.79 --> 6279.1
is pretty much describing Israel as kind

6276.369 --> 6281.469
of like a forced alliance that's how he

6279.1 --> 6284.29
regards it I understand that that's

6281.469 --> 6286.63
partially true but at the same time

6284.29 --> 6288.73
Israel is not a very reliable ally and

6286.63 --> 6290.59
he pretty much allies with anyone and

6288.73 --> 6293.4
betrays any ally whenever they deem fit

6290.59 --> 6298.9890000000005
and that's widely known internationally

6293.4 --> 6301.54
so it's just a messy setup but the

6298.989 --> 6305.619
Chinese do what the Chinese does and

6301.54 --> 6307.81
they definitely have their influences

6305.619 --> 6310.36
especially corporate wise they have a

6307.81 --> 6314.5
lot of influence on corporations and on

6310.36 --> 6316.7699999999995
the narrative but at the same time you

6314.5 --> 6320.489
could say because of the media

6316.77 --> 6326.110000000001
controllers yet they do turn out to be

6320.489 --> 6329.65
Jews as they say and they are forwarding

6326.11 --> 6332.199
that pro-china narrative as well so at

6329.65 --> 6335.129999999999
this yet C it is just very complicated

6332.199 --> 6335.129999999999
all of it

6344.1 --> 6352.410000000001
that's that's just terrible you guys are

6350.17 --> 6352.41
terrible

6353.91 --> 6361.72
