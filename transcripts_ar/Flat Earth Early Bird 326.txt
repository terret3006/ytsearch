cloudy but still there's no clear spaces

92.24 --> 98.72
anywhere although as many of you may

95.0 --> 105.07
have noticed there was in the evening

98.72 --> 108.86

105.07 --> 111.88999999999999
first two moon videos so my p900

yesterday and I should have premiered

111.89 --> 119.47

115.159 --> 119.47
I didn't think of it at the time

120.77 --> 125.47999999999999
[Music]

122.93 --> 129.34
so let's see who's in chat yeah I got to

125.48 --> 132.46

129.34 --> 132.46
[Music]

134.47 --> 142.13
right so Amanda you almost first today

137.45 --> 146.17999999999998
AJ Emma's hair Steve over McCole ego

142.13 --> 149.66
plane and anchor Dan Winfield oh yeah

146.18 --> 161.48000000000002
good to see you so yesterday was a crazy

149.66 --> 163.57999999999998
day that show was just nuts and it kind

161.48 --> 166.48999999999998
of felt like I almost didn't really have

163.58 --> 169.42000000000002
anything to do with it anymore other

166.49 --> 173.15
than yeah the Trish has bothered me

169.42 --> 175.39
before everybody knows and then

173.15 --> 181.33
proceeded to do it with other people and

175.39 --> 184.16
I blocked here now I unblocked her and

181.33 --> 187.94000000000003
yet this persists I'm gonna block her

184.16 --> 191.04999999999998
again because I just don't don't want to

187.94 --> 195.98
get involved in that nonsense

191.05 --> 200.0
but yeah Gracie stuff going down keeping

195.98 --> 203.6
some track on Rasta and Riley's

200.0 --> 207.31
activities the research the whole thing

203.6 --> 211.42
and yeah they're making work of it I

207.31 --> 215.12
think rest kept himself up all night

211.42 --> 220.1
didn't sleep at all just figuring

215.12 --> 222.04
getting all the data together huh well

220.1 --> 225.10999999999999
I'll see what's gonna happen

222.04 --> 225.10999999999999
[Music]

227.08 --> 232.99
no darkstar Trish didn't body anyone

234.5 --> 243.53
and you're an idiot troll that

238.12 --> 246.08
politicizes any anything that somehow

243.53 --> 248.8
opposes your perceived religious

246.08 --> 256.01
opponent it's very sad

248.8 --> 260.23900000000003
very very very sad yeah yeah Trish was

256.01 --> 262.73
just totally ballistic oh my god today I

260.239 --> 269.39
didn't call it Trish hits the fan for

262.73 --> 271.49
nothing because yeah there were very

269.39 --> 282.65
little words coming out and a lot of

271.49 --> 285.29
crap I was just totally ridiculous yeah

282.65 --> 285.59
of course you do Dark Star of course you

285.29 --> 288.64000000000004
do

285.59 --> 288.64
[Music]

300.73 --> 306.92
right so I'm still tense today because

304.52 --> 309.669
of tomorrow and there will be no early

306.92 --> 317.78000000000003
bird show tomorrow as I said yesterday

309.669 --> 324.68
and just trying to stay level I've

317.78 --> 327.55999999999995
actually even emergency constructing new

324.68 --> 330.35
plants just to preoccupy my mind while

327.56 --> 334.34
that's gonna go down to somehow give it

330.35 --> 336.71000000000004
a purpose even if just temporarily

334.34 --> 339.56
otherwise I'm just gonna go nuts

336.71 --> 348.26
tomorrow and I don't want to do that in

339.56 --> 353.12
front of my dad but anyway yeah things

348.26 --> 355.15999999999997
may change around a little because well

353.12 --> 357.65
what's going down is that there's

355.16 --> 360.29
basically barely any space left to store

357.65 --> 366.229
my stuff they have for a long long time

360.29 --> 370.1
now five years and I'm gonna try to

366.229 --> 373.46
basically turn my room into a semi

370.1 --> 377.47900000000004
storage room and funnily enough the way

373.46 --> 379.21999999999997
I've planned it out the webcam is not

377.479 --> 383.75
gonna pick it up so it's going to be

379.22 --> 386.66
pretty much on that side and I think I

383.75 --> 391.49
could stash quite a lot of things there

386.66 --> 397.31
actually if my dad agrees that to help

391.49 --> 398.78000000000003
me build the the frameworks as it were

397.31 --> 404.14
to store it all because I can't just

398.78 --> 404.14
stack it it's kind of dangerous anyway

404.229 --> 412.24
yeah

405.44 --> 412.24
plants so I can move on

413.24 --> 418.35
because creation is forcing me into

415.74 --> 421.11
another material sacrifice as it were

418.35 --> 429.93
and I'm not happy about it I can tell

421.11 --> 436.11
you that um no no Fyodor we're not gonna

429.93 --> 438.57
donate that focus on her at all yeah and

436.11 --> 440.76
all that super chat money it's

438.57 --> 443.61
completely useless I explained it I

440.76 --> 448.23
explained it before and after she did

443.61 --> 454.44
that besides I have a Bible now and that

448.23 --> 456.62
was what it was supposedly for you got

454.44 --> 456.62
it

458.03 --> 463.5
so whatever the opinions may be about

461.73 --> 467.0
what happened in the past it has been

463.5 --> 470.17
resolved and there is no issue left

467.0 --> 470.17
[Music]

485.959 --> 492.019
yeah it's good catch

488.519 --> 492.019
hm thanks for that

523.79 --> 528.56
yeah it is funny I'm really just trying

526.28 --> 531.56
to puzzle around with the whole room in

528.56 --> 534.77
my mind figuring out if I could

531.56 --> 542.3599999999999
potentially somehow managed to get my

534.77 --> 545.9
actual bed in here because that bed just

542.36 --> 548.84
sleeps so much better than little thingy

545.9 --> 552.4399999999999
that I've been forced to sleep on in the

548.84 --> 561.59
last six years but it takes up a lot of

552.44 --> 563.96
space so it's yeah may not gonna happen

561.59 --> 567.94
anytime soon but anyway yeah this is

563.96 --> 567.94
just preoccupying my mind currently

577.62 --> 584.88
right Fyodor Dostoevsky I agree with you

580.8 --> 587.37
but look there's also people out there

584.88 --> 591.3
that want to use the super Jets as just

587.37 --> 595.32
a message board and it still functions

591.3 --> 598.8
as that so I will shout out super chants

595.32 --> 602.0100000000001
from people it's just that it's at this

598.8 --> 604.64
in my current financial setup as it were

602.01 --> 607.62
it's completely useless to me now that

604.64 --> 609.3
doesn't mean that maybe in the future I

607.62 --> 612.72
will have a different financial setup

609.3 --> 614.8199999999999
and it will become as good as extra

612.72 --> 619.5600000000001
income that I don't have to directly pay

614.82 --> 622.19
back and so but for now yeah that is

619.56 --> 622.1899999999999
just what it is

627.11 --> 637.14
and also yeah in my in my startup and

632.79 --> 639.5
round out sequence I do mention paper

637.14 --> 642.21
yeah PayPal as the primary source

639.5 --> 644.16
sometimes even do a little extra

642.21 --> 646.6700000000001
explanation and say that super Chet

644.16 --> 651.75
saved the super chats for last only as

646.67 --> 655.14
decoration so I've been pretty outspoken

651.75 --> 658.2
about that since I figured that out

655.14 --> 660.23
which has been yeah almost half a year

658.2 --> 660.23
now

678.06 --> 685.9799999999999
no alert from YouTube this morning huh

682.34 --> 688.1700000000001
okay I'll do check the bail notification

685.98 --> 691.07
I don't know why I did start a little

688.17 --> 691.0699999999999
early can we

706.2 --> 716.98
yeah I had a weird talk by the way

710.23 --> 721.78
it was um yeah with the social worker

716.98 --> 723.5500000000001
that kind of it's my contact person with

721.78 --> 726.6999999999999
the government as it were sounds very

723.55 --> 729.76
ominous that way but it is more like my

726.7 --> 733.36
engagement with society helping me to

729.76 --> 735.31
well I basically put out my idea to him

733.36 --> 737.7
about trying to get work somehow and

735.31 --> 743.92
talked it through carefully all of it

737.7 --> 747.37
including well I just hate word about

743.92 --> 750.37
including the handicapped part like my

747.37 --> 754.0600000000001
weird stress out response that I

750.37 --> 755.86
sometimes have and however that would be

754.06 --> 758.65
responded to and just talked in overall

755.86 --> 762.57
and it's very problematic and we did

758.65 --> 765.85
eventually conclude like I'm it's better

762.57 --> 773.8900000000001
to keep on basically doing what I do and

765.85 --> 777.73
maybe find some other like self-reliant

773.89 --> 782.16
type of work activities somehow just add

777.73 --> 782.16
more onto the pile basically and

785.47 --> 794.86
and just see where it goes and who knows

792.58 --> 799.48
may yeah we even figured out look there

794.86 --> 802.0
may be bosses out there that totally get

799.48 --> 806.32
my type because I'm not the only one

802.0 --> 809.98
that has this although I may be one of

806.32 --> 813.6700000000001
the more weird ones because I'm also

809.98 --> 817.44
very fluently spoken and quite

813.67 --> 822.88
insightful yet I still have that thing

817.44 --> 824.62
so it's all about if there are people

822.88 --> 832.57
out there that would be willing to deal

824.62 --> 836.14
with somebody like me and basically have

832.57 --> 840.1800000000001
some function for my specific skills for

836.14 --> 843.61
the peak skills that I can utilize and

840.18 --> 845.62
also yeah it it's also it is kind of

843.61 --> 851.1
about personal bonding too you know they

845.62 --> 851.1
have to kind of be able to like me and

853.26 --> 862.12
it's tough to explain it is very

857.02 --> 865.48
personal and look I with a friend from

862.12 --> 868.3
previous times what similar issues a to

865.48 --> 871.9
mine in another form and he can't did

868.3 --> 874.87
the same had the same thing he was

871.9 --> 878.85
pretty good at what he does but had some

874.87 --> 882.46
issues and there were bosses out there

878.85 --> 886.09
that would then be specifically informed

882.46 --> 888.58
about that and had a special a special

886.09 --> 891.94
kind of contract he did I don't I didn't

888.58 --> 893.6500000000001
like the sound of any of it just the

891.94 --> 898.1400000000001
approach but it did kind of work he did

893.65 --> 898.14
have work because of that despite his

898.69 --> 904.9590000000001
is any cash and I wonder if I could try

903.16 --> 907.329
something similar if that is even

904.959 --> 909.55
sensible or again that I would have to

907.329 --> 912.16
enroll into the Machine and they have

909.55 --> 914.819
all these stamps put on me know these

912.16 --> 917.5
people checking up because that's that

914.819 --> 921.9699999999999
would crush me so that that's never

917.5 --> 923.769
gonna happen like that but if I can find

921.97 --> 929.4590000000001
an understanding with somebody out there

923.769 --> 933.699
that could see some yeah some purpose in

929.459 --> 937.3
getting me into his business or whatever

933.699 --> 940.149
then maybe I can get lucky that way but

937.3 --> 945.0089999999999
other than that it's just gonna be doing

940.149 --> 946.81
more more little things and also

945.009 --> 951.12
basically planning it out you know I

946.81 --> 954.9699999999999
I've always shied away from even just

951.12 --> 958.6
businesslike thinking it's but I got to

954.97 --> 962.23
do it so anyway I got somebody to talk

958.6 --> 967.7090000000001
with about that on a semi-professional

962.23 --> 970.649
level and I'll get there eventually

967.709 --> 975.279
biggest part for me is to just be

970.649 --> 978.97
reasonable and sensible about how I see

975.279 --> 982.99
myself in doing this I can't have insane

978.97 --> 985.269
expectations I can't just imagine only

982.99 --> 987.189
the glory parts without taking into

985.269 --> 990.55
account dealing with the pressures and

987.189 --> 991.99
all that so I mustn't idealize in my

990.55 --> 995.2299999999999
mind whatever I'm going to visualize

991.99 --> 998.0790000000001
into the future or or it'll smash me in

995.23 --> 1000.99
the face when y'all get there that's

998.079 --> 1005.939
happened before one of the bigger

1000.99 --> 1009.92
problems so yeah that's what I'm doing a

1005.939 --> 1016.709
lot of self-reflection in preparation of

1009.92 --> 1019.3499999999999
tomorrow oh by the way notice hello

1016.709 --> 1023.5189999999999
Jason of the disparate family good to

1019.35 --> 1026.179
see you of my chat is it actually Jason

1023.519 --> 1026.179
or is this

1026.39 --> 1033.7900000000002
it's this somebody from the tour anyway

1030.829 --> 1033.79
thanks for popping by

1049.45 --> 1052.569
[Music]

1056.789 --> 1064.799
right well that's the whole point of me

1060.399 --> 1067.6299999999999
bringing it up like that Lorie let TL

1064.799 --> 1070.86
the regarding of the handicapped that's

1067.63 --> 1070.8600000000001
that's the whole point

1071.909 --> 1080.529
it's a weird duality I can't somehow

1074.95 --> 1084.19
have to deal with because I can't just

1080.529 --> 1087.19
pretend like that I have no no failings

1084.19 --> 1089.74
in my system that are that become

1087.19 --> 1091.779
apparent as it were I can't keep on

1089.74 --> 1094.36
hiding that because eventually it'll

1091.779 --> 1099.82
snap and yeah

1094.36 --> 1102.36
the fallout so it's kind of a where do

1099.82 --> 1105.58
allottee I have to deal with like okay

1102.36 --> 1108.4599999999998
I'm not just gonna like take the mark

1105.58 --> 1112.559
and like oh I'm a kneecap now because

1108.46 --> 1119.5900000000001
that's for me psychologically just

1112.559 --> 1123.1589999999999
undoable and it feels ridiculous being

1119.59 --> 1124.6899999999998
as well-spoken and smart as I am smart

1123.159 --> 1128.0100000000002
enough whatever I don't even care

1124.69 --> 1128.01
anymore you know

1134.76 --> 1138.809
so

1136.5 --> 1142.32
it's a weird duality I have to somehow

1138.809 --> 1150.299
be able to figure out the right type of

1142.32 --> 1155.299
representation of what I am and build it

1150.299 --> 1160.62
up on a a framework into the future that

1155.299 --> 1165.48
doesn't eat me up on the inside slowly

1160.62 --> 1168.4499999999998
it has to be constructive in order for

1165.48 --> 1170.549
me to continue building from wherever

1168.45 --> 1173.8500000000001
I'm gonna be ending up because I don't

1170.549 --> 1176.45
can't even oversee that might become

1173.85 --> 1179.6299999999999
pretty chaotic all of a sudden

1176.45 --> 1179.63
[Music]

1187.05 --> 1199.95
hmm Paul that a good show could be yeah

1196.94 --> 1202.56
I'm just in a bit of a retracted mode

1199.95 --> 1207.5900000000001
and it's really the nervousness it's

1202.56 --> 1210.9299999999998
just like it's kind of the same as

1207.59 --> 1213.4199999999998
before the conference except there was a

1210.93 --> 1218.43
much more positive excitement and this

1213.42 --> 1221.8700000000001
is more like not so positive but it is

1218.43 --> 1223.64
the same experience tension wise really

1221.87 --> 1226.6499999999999
[Music]

1223.64 --> 1233.3100000000002
but when I'm like that I tend to retract

1226.65 --> 1235.38
it just not not touch the snare so that

1233.31 --> 1237.71
it keeps on vibrating just keeping it as

1235.38 --> 1241.5
still as possible for the time being

1237.71 --> 1243.77
because that way I yeah I can keep it

1241.5 --> 1243.77
cool

1248.74 --> 1256.299
[Music]

1268.91 --> 1275.25
[Music]

1279.11 --> 1287.3799999999999
[Music]

1306.96 --> 1315.64
all right now I didn't eat it

1312.87 --> 1318.9599999999998
come on you didn't need to timeout hojae

1315.64 --> 1318.96
for that was just a lame joke

1321.06 --> 1324.23
[Music]

1326.7 --> 1332.1000000000001
all right well Karen B I would say just

1328.98 --> 1334.08
has his own and take I don't know I

1332.1 --> 1335.1299999999999
think that Jose is probably on average

1334.08 --> 1338.97
pretty nervous

1335.13 --> 1354.41
approaching groups so that is what he

1338.97 --> 1354.41
does he just he's just a little nervous

1355.76 --> 1363.48
so it just puts down like an axe for a

1359.94 --> 1364.95
moment as an intro to stave off the

1363.48 --> 1368.16
nerves

1364.95 --> 1368.16
[Music]

1372.869 --> 1379.569
yeah but if he's gonna be all nasty

1375.669 --> 1388.5590000000002
again then that was on the debates if

1379.569 --> 1391.059
it's just I don't know why does that he

1388.559 --> 1394.979
self-sabotage is immediately right well

1391.059 --> 1394.979
yeah that's a matter of perspective but

1422.63 --> 1425.5
all right

1426.28 --> 1430.78
yeah mark Collard yeah well that's

1428.2 --> 1437.23
that's my approach does he was just

1430.78 --> 1439.27
really triggered for some reason and he

1437.23 --> 1445.69
acted out I don't know I guess a lot of

1439.27 --> 1448.0
people are experiencing similar moods or

1445.69 --> 1451.18
a little things subtly trigger them more

1448.0 --> 1453.01
than usual everybody's having a little

1451.18 --> 1455.2
bit trouble maintaining their composure

1453.01 --> 1460.99
but it is also the time of the year

1455.2 --> 1466.68
I think so everybody's a little bit more

1460.99 --> 1466.68
on edge just the time of the year

1478.9 --> 1491.3200000000002
all right good for you Daniel but look

1486.01 --> 1495.52
Nathan Nathan just puts down the

1491.32 --> 1501.9099999999999
arguments and then pushes them to as far

1495.52 --> 1504.82
as it can go you can call that nasty

1501.91 --> 1509.76
behavior but the real nasty behavior is

1504.82 --> 1513.28
the blatant purposefully placed ignorant

1509.76 --> 1515.679
the the pretense of ignorance that is

1513.28 --> 1517.3899999999999
systematically applied by the ballers in

1515.679 --> 1521.8600000000001
these arguments that dragged on for

1517.39 --> 1525.8500000000001
hours because they systematically ignore

1521.86 --> 1529.6
things and do not respond so that will

1525.85 --> 1532.87
eventually spur forth nasty behavior but

1529.6 --> 1536.08
that nasty behavior is not just random

1532.87 --> 1540.52
nastiness that is a direct response to

1536.08 --> 1542.62
the level on this psychological garbage

1540.52 --> 1547.3899999999999
that is being shuffled in our faces

1542.62 --> 1550.4399999999998
every time so it's a matter of

1547.39 --> 1550.44
perspective Daniel

1555.429 --> 1561.49
and a forum one tonight no it's not a

1558.009 --> 1564.559
full moon tonight not here

1561.49 --> 1564.559
[Music]

1567.51 --> 1575.87
now I think the full moon should be on

1571.5 --> 1579.0
Sunday I did check it not too long ago

1575.87 --> 1579.0
[Music]

1580.84 --> 1587.1999999999998
[Applause]

1581.69 --> 1587.2
[Music]

1598.79 --> 1608.73
sitting out there to tell fara right 13

1603.78 --> 1611.25
October that's when the moon is full as

1608.73 --> 1614.49
I as I remember it so it's no it's not a

1611.25 --> 1617.27
full moon it's what is it what's it

1614.49 --> 1620.51
called when it's growing is that waxing

1617.27 --> 1623.49
so it's a waxing moon it is it is

1620.51 --> 1628.83
technically that the time when tension

1623.49 --> 1632.08
does build up so you got a point but

1628.83 --> 1635.27
it's not full not until the 13th

1632.08 --> 1635.27
[Music]

1645.83 --> 1649.299
josè stop it

1655.66 --> 1661.26
yeah Ragnar it is it should be

1665.17 --> 1669.9
now it's full moon Sunday the 13th

1692.34 --> 1702.99
all right right I don't know who this is

1695.28 --> 1704.61
it is a troll obviously but oh wow even

1702.99 --> 1712.08
getting a little racist at it that's

1704.61 --> 1715.32
really that's really classy but I first

1712.08 --> 1719.55
off there is no nasty behavior here I do

1715.32 --> 1725.1899999999998
not behave nasty although it sometimes

1719.55 --> 1727.8799999999999
in chats up up to certain specific type

1725.19 --> 1731.79
of troll individuals I can get kind of

1727.88 --> 1734.3100000000002
painful I agree to that but that's

1731.79 --> 1742.77
separate that's not my public behavior

1734.31 --> 1746.3999999999999
really that's not what I do here but yes

1742.77 --> 1754.68
as for saying these things to people's

1746.4 --> 1757.5500000000002
faces yes definitely I would absolutely

1754.68 --> 1758.93
because all the arguments are real

1757.55 --> 1762.45
[Music]

1758.93 --> 1764.1000000000001
although in in reality the difference is

1762.45 --> 1765.96
is that if somebody's going to be

1764.1 --> 1768.29
backtracking when I when they actually

1765.96 --> 1771.0900000000001
face the arguments start muttering

1768.29 --> 1774.18
probably in themselves because its face

1771.09 --> 1778.62
to face I'm not gonna just smash them

1774.18 --> 1782.3400000000001
outright unless they keep on trying to

1778.62 --> 1788.2199999999998
assert their ignorance then I'm gonna be

1782.34 --> 1789.36
like okay you better just piss off get

1788.22 --> 1791.32
out of my face

1789.36 --> 1793.01
if you're gonna act like a lunatic

1791.32 --> 1798.1399999999999
[Music]

1793.01 --> 1798.14
that's what I would do that's it

1801.159 --> 1812.6190000000001
now that's not true Daniel I do it with

1804.679 --> 1818.23
everyone and it's not projecting it is

1812.619 --> 1821.2389999999998
analyzing projecting is seeing something

1818.23 --> 1825.109
that is actually what you're preoccupied

1821.239 --> 1829.059
with and then you overlay that structure

1825.109 --> 1832.1589999999999
onto somebody else but when you project

1829.059 --> 1834.019
it's very clear because you also start

1832.159 --> 1837.169
to point out little details that are

1834.019 --> 1839.269
just completely not present that's how

1837.169 --> 1841.429
you recognize projection when things get

1839.269 --> 1842.779
too specific in a personal way that is

1841.429 --> 1848.299
when you know people somebody is

1842.779 --> 1850.85
projecting so yeah you can't try to eye

1848.299 --> 1854.139
out psychologize me because I know

1850.85 --> 1854.139
exactly what I'm doing

1867.4 --> 1872.5600000000002
[Music]

1870.12 --> 1875.4599999999998
yeah stop whining

1872.56 --> 1875.46
Daniel

1876.29 --> 1883.849
[Music]

1891.679 --> 1897.539
yeah it's none of your concern if you

1895.32 --> 1901.61
don't know what was talked about then

1897.539 --> 1901.61
don't complain about what is being done

1906.23 --> 1909.39
[Music]

1910.929 --> 1914.47
it's not funny

1917.02 --> 1931.15
anyway right yeah I thought let's show

1925.27 --> 1936.51
some awesome moon footage it's very

1931.15 --> 1936.51
specific part completely without sound

1938.01 --> 1944.22
I'm not too happy about the resolution

1940.99 --> 1944.22
of this thing I don't get it

1948.72 --> 1955.3600000000001
like the resolution of what I got is

1952.54 --> 1960.8999999999999
pretty damn low even though I have a

1955.36 --> 1964.87
soup or hire a thousand a DP at least

1960.9 --> 1967.0300000000002
sized footage of that but I can't seem

1964.87 --> 1972.2199999999998
to isolate it I I guess I don't have the

1967.03 --> 1974.77
proper equipment to do it also that yeah

1972.22 --> 1977.26
depite transferring a video file from

1974.77 --> 1980.8
the P 900 to my computer seemed like

1977.26 --> 1988.08
quite a hassle it was a bit of a

1980.8 --> 1988.08
disappointment let's see

1991.01 --> 1994.21
[Music]

1998.85 --> 2003.4399999999998
I'll just present it through the Skype

2001.37 --> 2007.7199999999998
because I put it out in the early bird

2003.44 --> 2007.72
chat as well hey

2012.73 --> 2014.76
Oh

2029.99 --> 2039.6200000000001
okay yeah so I I didn't premiere this

2035.929 --> 2046.7
last night so I'm just gonna show it to

2039.62 --> 2049.5699999999997
you this is the isolated video the

2046.7 --> 2049.57
special piece

2066.8 --> 2071.9190000000003
yeah pretty cool

2075.23 --> 2080.0
yeah I cut out the parts where I

2077.48 --> 2085.179
actually talked I'm glad that I managed

2080.0 --> 2085.179
to hold my tongue during the whole thing

2085.63 --> 2088.82
[Music]

2094.89 --> 2103.56
right so anyway that was a got one of my

2100.86 --> 2106.79
first moon shots and that happened so

2103.56 --> 2106.79
what's very happy about that

2114.41 --> 2120.609
okay

2116.619 --> 2122.8900000000003
well actually Twitter it it does kind of

2120.609 --> 2126.13
look like a hologram because there's

2122.89 --> 2127.9
just this apparent spherical structure

2126.13 --> 2131.65
there but if you then contrast to

2127.9 --> 2134.349
something flying closer by that's just

2131.65 --> 2138.4790000000003
the scale of it all just doesn't make

2134.349 --> 2138.4790000000003
any sense at all

2143.38 --> 2155.11
noloty I'm just timing you out because

2145.66 --> 2159.6099999999997
you're being annoying yeah I just said

2155.11 --> 2161.98
exactly that then you'll stop asking

2159.61 --> 2166.8900000000003
questions after I just put out the

2161.98 --> 2166.89
answer [ __ ] sake

2174.73 --> 2184.329
I just set the whole scale where it

2181.66 --> 2186.46
supposedly is the moon and the surface

2184.329 --> 2188.4100000000003
this the presupposed surface and all

2186.46 --> 2192.07
that what you're looking at and then

2188.41 --> 2196.5989999999997
scale it to the plane flying right in

2192.07 --> 2200.7400000000002
front of it the scale is off it's not

2196.599 --> 2203.1090000000004
the same size in the same realm it's the

2200.74 --> 2209.0699999999997
the moon is holographic it's not

2203.109 --> 2209.0699999999997
literally there like as the visuals show

2214.5 --> 2223.96
shut up Jose our on venue after the show

2222.43 --> 2226.7799999999997
is over because you're just being a dick

2223.96 --> 2227.8
and I don't want you whining like a

2226.78 --> 2233.36
troll in my chat

2227.8 --> 2233.36

[Music]

2286.329 --> 2292.849
people insist on destroying my chest

2289.039 --> 2296.509
because they are complete [ __ ] no

2292.849 --> 2301.579
other reason really replay the moon

2296.509 --> 2308.859
footage no I could just play the the

2301.579 --> 2308.8590000000004
video let's see how well that goes

2340.82 --> 2355.04
the hell OBS is kind of [ __ ]

2348.69 --> 2355.04
sometimes alright um okay

2359.64 --> 2363.23
[Music]

2369.19 --> 2376.669
[Music]

2370.819 --> 2389.5389999999998
yeah I'll just play both clips represent

2376.669 --> 2390.769
them including commercials put them

2389.539 --> 2394.3590000000004
there so it's my own fault

2390.769 --> 2394.359
all right so here you go

2429.22 --> 2432.2799999999997
[Applause]

2464.7 --> 2471.98
oh I think I forgot to put it off mute

2468.589 --> 2471.98
no I didn't

2492.24 --> 2497.819
it's pretty interesting looking and

2495.72 --> 2504.569
literally didn't move so this entire

2497.819 --> 2507.72
slide by Monsieur just its own angular

2504.569 --> 2510.68
motion across the heaven the camera

2507.72 --> 2510.68
completely still

2513.06 --> 2516.93
there's a couple of clouds

2540.21 --> 2556.819
so anyway thought not bad for our first

2546.0 --> 2556.819
go see you in the early bird show

2602.19 --> 2609.06
all right yeah Harry Harrison I did it I

2605.98 --> 2609.06
can complain about it

2619.4 --> 2627.2290000000003
yeah yeah I know I was muted

2623.07 --> 2627.2290000000003
[Music]

2629.95 --> 2635.12
so yeah I don't know what's wrong with

2632.21 --> 2636.95
Jose but he was apparently so triggered

2635.12 --> 2642.47
by me blocking him because of his

2636.95 --> 2646.04
ridiculous behavior that he's he said in

2642.47 --> 2650.62
Skype the movements hashtag unsub Arwen

2646.04 --> 2654.14
begins today you little prick it's just

2650.62 --> 2657.74
what got him so insanely triggered all

2654.14 --> 2661.16
of a sudden and what

2657.74 --> 2665.12
what does Jose's why does he think he

2661.16 --> 2668.77
has the right to just act like an

2665.12 --> 2668.77
[ __ ] in here I did just

2672.48 --> 2678.57
you know I don't get it I make fun of

2675.21 --> 2682.2
some people that themselves obviously

2678.57 --> 2685.6800000000003
behave very terribly on their own

2682.2 --> 2689.16
volition they started right so at least

2685.68 --> 2693.3289999999997
I can reciprocate or I should be allowed

2689.16 --> 2696.66
to I don't get why Jose thinks that he

2693.329 --> 2702.119
can just get in my chat all of a sudden

2696.66 --> 2704.8199999999997
and act like this I don't get it and why

2702.119 --> 2708.15
he then needs to declare some kind of

2704.82 --> 2710.01
war or whatever against me because I'm

2708.15 --> 2713.07
not tolerating it even though I did say

2710.01 --> 2718.67
look just cool it down and you'll be

2713.07 --> 2718.67
unblocked after this so I don't get it

2718.82 --> 2725.9900000000002
what did I ever do wrong here Jose you

2723.51 --> 2725.9900000000002

2757.49 --> 2765.3599999999997
regularly if I come over there you know

2761.51 --> 2767.73
he does treat me graciously when I get

2765.36 --> 2770.55
on and I really do appreciate and I want

2767.73 --> 2773.01
to reciprocate that but at the same time

2770.55 --> 2776.82
if I start to behave like really nasty

2773.01 --> 2779.28
and disruptive Lee which I never do I

2776.82 --> 2782.9100000000003
hope certainly hope I managed to

2779.28 --> 2786.57
completely stop that all of it in its

2782.91 --> 2788.91
tracks and now I did like go over the

2786.57 --> 2791.01
edge like way in the past even before

2788.91 --> 2793.08
the early bird show because it was very

2791.01 --> 2796.1400000000003
hard to handle all that [ __ ] in the

2793.08 --> 2798.5099999999998
Patrol nastiness but I think I managed

2796.14 --> 2801.06
pretty well so what I do expect that if

2798.51 --> 2804.1800000000003
I go for the edge that he's gonna block

2801.06 --> 2807.87
me tie me out as well and I wouldn't

2804.18 --> 2810.87
mind but I don't get why he doesn't feel

2807.87 --> 2814.6099999999997
the same it's to his own man if you you

2810.87 --> 2814.6099999999997
know if he's just gonna be in shed and

2817.25 --> 2823.59
get all attacking and complaining about

2820.83 --> 2826.35
the moderation well he knows how the

2823.59 --> 2828.6600000000003
moderation works here now on the other

2826.35 --> 2833.24
hand the person who timed him out the

2828.66 --> 2833.24
first time that was kind of unnecessary

2836.73 --> 2843.5
so that probably triggered him initially

2839.91 --> 2847.3489999999997
you know Jose always wants to do a very

2843.5 --> 2852.48
fake sounding artificial intro message

2847.349 --> 2854.849
act and you got to let him do that if

2852.48 --> 2860.64
you don't he's gonna turn into a total

2854.849 --> 2863.07
shitty troll pretty much so please take

2860.64 --> 2866.0989999999997
that into account the next time you see

2863.07 --> 2871.28
one of his very annoying fake sounding

2866.099 --> 2871.28
intro messages in the chat okay people

2879.0 --> 2881.96
okay

2904.81 --> 2907.35
who

2915.05 --> 2921.6000000000004
right

2917.64 --> 2924.5499999999997
yeah man

2921.6 --> 2927.3399999999997
Rhys I haven't I've never really seen

2924.55 --> 2929.38
you this forward like I think ever since

2927.34 --> 2932.8500000000004
your inspiration you've been much more

2929.38 --> 2936.79
forward but yeah I do agree with you

2932.85 --> 2939.6
that's probably because it is kind of a

2936.79 --> 2942.61
attention grabby cry-baby attitude

2939.6 --> 2954.04
unnecessarily so it's part of his acts

2942.61 --> 2959.26
and with act I mean not a script it's

2954.04 --> 2964.08
just the act he puts up to represent

2959.26 --> 2964.0800000000004
himself that kind of act

no that's not true by the way rector

3045.3 --> 3051.23
Stefan Helder San Jose has stopped me

3047.55 --> 3057.63
from saying what I was thinking at times

3051.23 --> 3060.45
but right but that's when I'm actually

3057.63 --> 3064.07
on the panel because mostly Jose just

3060.45 --> 3064.0699999999997
seems to ignore what is in chat

3067.77 --> 3070.969
[Music]

3074.22 --> 3084.6099999999997

3114.54 --> 3122.79
cause it just doesn't want doesn't have

3117.66 --> 3125.7599999999998
the dumb phones yeah yeah I have to say

3122.79 --> 3132.08
you know does I get so many persistent

3125.76 --> 3136.2900000000004
downloads it's just nuts like every show

3132.08 --> 3139.71
it's usually like 27 the early bird

3136.29 --> 3141.63
shows that is you know my my special

3139.71 --> 3143.79
upload is footage or whatever it's not

3141.63 --> 3146.6400000000003
the same thing but like the earlier

3143.79 --> 3148.65
somebody are a lot of people like really

3146.64 --> 3151.62
don't like the early bird show for some

3148.65 --> 3156.9300000000003
reason or they politically or whatever

3151.62 --> 3159.98
ly oppose it that they think it's

3156.93 --> 3163.44
actually worth the attention to keep on

3159.98 --> 3167.78
doing that or put some kind of bots

3163.44 --> 3167.78
situation in place in order to do that

3168.23 --> 3171.71
it's freaky

3173.92 --> 3183.1
it's like what did I ever do I'm just a

3179.29 --> 3186.64
guy giving his views and insights on

3183.1 --> 3193.87
things think psychology think spirit

3186.64 --> 3196.2999999999997
wise science wise physics historic

3193.87 --> 3199.72
history conceptualizations I just

3196.3 --> 3202.57
conceptualize a lot and I share those

3199.72 --> 3204.8799999999997
ideas and I try to be very correct and

3202.57 --> 3209.0800000000004
open-minded about everything what why do

3204.88 --> 3213.7200000000003
I deserve 30 dislikes in a video that

3209.08 --> 3213.72
hasn't even ended yet what is that about

3226.6 --> 3235.0899999999997
yeah I know Sparrow music but that's not

3230.05 --> 3240.61
my issue it's just that it's so

3235.09 --> 3242.65
persistent and look let's just say it

3240.61 --> 3245.4100000000003
like this compare it to the Flat Earth

3242.65 --> 3247.36
debates right and I'm a part of that as

3245.41 --> 3250.8399999999997
well I do my own thing

3247.36 --> 3253.78
in my own standards but yeah there is

3250.84 --> 3257.65
like some serious negative [ __ ] at what

3253.78 --> 3259.69
times and hey you could argue deservedly

3257.65 --> 3263.35
so maybe a little bit too far but it is

3259.69 --> 3266.38
a pretty insane situation overall so

3263.35 --> 3269.2599999999998
it's a much more anything goes type set

3266.38 --> 3272.6800000000003
up naturally but then I would imagine

3269.26 --> 3275.2900000000004
that people would be potentially we have

3272.68 --> 3277.95
heard about that and then say like oh

3275.29 --> 3282.94
god it's really better downvotes

3277.95 --> 3291.0899999999997
sure but what did I ever do to get 38

3282.94 --> 3295.54
down votes here you know am I constantly

3291.09 --> 3299.32
hating on people being very evil or

3295.54 --> 3302.17
merciless or super hypocritical in my

3299.32 --> 3304.8700000000003
dealings in some way that just would

3302.17 --> 3310.33
cause people to be drawn in like this

3304.87 --> 3312.69
and persistently do that I'm just a guy

3310.33 --> 3317.56
talking on average pretty calmly

3312.69 --> 3321.52
sometimes a little bit passionate I'm

3317.56 --> 3323.89
very open direct and talk about a lot of

3321.52 --> 3332.32
personal details that people usually

3323.89 --> 3336.1299999999997
tend not to do but is it that bad

3332.32 --> 3338.1400000000003
I know I just I'm just talking in

3336.13 --> 3340.7200000000003
general because I know you guys a lot of

3338.14 --> 3341.35
you and not even that I have seen face

3340.72 --> 3344.8599999999997
to face

3341.35 --> 3349.15
I do trust I have felt and I trust that

3344.86 --> 3350.65
you do appreciate it and you don't see

3349.15 --> 3355.15
it from that but apparently they're

3350.65 --> 3359.05
still swaths of people out there that

3355.15 --> 3360.7200000000003
somehow find it so objectionable what I

3359.05 --> 3364.57
do here

3360.72 --> 3369.1899999999996
the content the way I do it the subjects

3364.57 --> 3371.6800000000003
may be that they would dedicate

3369.19 --> 3376.39
something anything to constantly

3371.68 --> 3379.2999999999997
download me throughout the history of

3376.39 --> 3381.31
this entire show now 39 down five see

3379.3 --> 3382.9
now it's just a sport because I'm

3381.31 --> 3385.7799999999997
talking about it so that's just like oh

3382.9 --> 3389.65
yeah now we can fool around and maybe

3385.78 --> 3411.0
you could get it to minus 300 votes or

3389.65 --> 3411.0
something you know this - 42

3415.48 --> 3421.2400000000002
now thank you David Johnson's I

3417.46 --> 3427.29
appreciate the recognition because I do

3421.24 --> 3430.0299999999997
take pride in that and I also am very

3427.29 --> 3432.91
convinced that that is just a better way

3430.03 --> 3436.9
to conduct yourself to not take so much

3432.91 --> 3439.54
foot in a certain opinion because it

3436.9 --> 3443.4100000000003
disrupts the clarity what you're dealing

3439.54 --> 3446.77
with even though it may seem like it

3443.41 --> 3449.97
will help you direct you on a path

3446.77 --> 3449.97
towards result

3454.19 --> 3459.589
but just having this absolute neutrality

3457.369 --> 3462.349
and honesty about all the elements and

3459.589 --> 3464.75
the needs that compel you from the

3462.349 --> 3468.77
inside to grab onto things and take them

3464.75 --> 3474.289
for for more real than you should know

3468.77 --> 3477.65
that is all apart of trying to figure it

3474.289 --> 3479.63
out because aberrations and mind traps

3477.65 --> 3483.38
are hidden everywhere and a lot of

3479.63 --> 3486.77
people that deal with the knowledge grow

3483.38 --> 3490.1600000000003
to overlook it overlooked those details

3486.77 --> 3493.599
and then get set in their ways in their

3490.16 --> 3499.25
approach it's not it's a natural

3493.599 --> 3505.299
response to do that but it is disruptive

3499.25 --> 3505.299
and it convolute s-- so much oversight

3511.27 --> 3516.109
mind traps

3512.9 --> 3518.2400000000002
well presuppositional mind traps mostly

3516.109 --> 3522.98
daniel having made up your mind about

3518.24 --> 3524.75
details that you settle for presupposing

3522.98 --> 3527.63
them because you are so convinced it

3524.75 --> 3530.359
must all be correct because something

3527.63 --> 3535.279
any aspect of anything tells you that it

3530.359 --> 3542.109
must that's a mind trap my trap of your

3535.279 --> 3547.099
own design your mind traps you into

3542.109 --> 3551.9
preventing taking other approaches as

3547.099 --> 3554.8590000000004
equal prevents you you'll shove

3551.9 --> 3554.859
everything else aside

3568.24 --> 3575.8599999999997
and another mindtrap is the the

3572.47 --> 3578.14
philosophical based religious pursuit to

3575.86 --> 3581.98
liberalize the scientific method and

3578.14 --> 3585.7
make anything into science that

3581.98 --> 3590.56
everything can be science now that is

3585.7 --> 3596.1099999999997
another mind trap it's the the

3590.56 --> 3598.96
convolution the the cracking up of the

3596.11 --> 3602.05
actual foundation on which you should be

3598.96 --> 3609.82
building things and convoluted to make

3602.05 --> 3613.26
the dream more easily yeah to make the

3609.82 --> 3617.3500000000004
dream more easy to to work with and

3613.26 --> 3619.92
present as acceptable overlooking the

3617.35 --> 3619.92
foundation

3620.59 --> 3626.139
[Music]

3632.17 --> 3636.07
[Music]

3648.06 --> 3655.9
that's a good point peanuts Clark yeah

3653.2 --> 3660.0699999999997
look if you're if you're looking for

3655.9 --> 3663.0
information to enrich your own designs

3660.07 --> 3666.7200000000003
or plans with yeah the Internet is great

3663.0 --> 3670.95
but the Internet has also become a

3666.72 --> 3676.99
widely widespread redesigned and

3670.95 --> 3680.98
designated socially to become an escape

3676.99 --> 3684.1299999999997
an escape from the burdens of regular

3680.98 --> 3686.02
social life for example and so people

3684.13 --> 3689.83
that are going to use the Internet to

3686.02 --> 3694.63
escape at they are not open-minded at

3689.83 --> 3696.25
all they just want to be entertained and

3694.63 --> 3697.48
they don't want to be confronted with

3696.25 --> 3702.25
things that'll make things more

3697.48 --> 3706.78
difficult to them so the Internet is

3702.25 --> 3708.9
very much divided up at it vast majority

3706.78 --> 3713.6200000000003
is just looking for amusement that

3708.9 --> 3715.39
before they did with the TV but the TV

3713.62 --> 3718.3599999999997
is kind of like outdated is so much more

3715.39 --> 3720.5499999999997
on the internet so they'd those previous

3718.36 --> 3724.42
TV watchers just migrated to the

3720.55 --> 3728.8300000000004
Internet and use it for entertainment

3724.42 --> 3733.1800000000003
and distraction and escapism in all

3728.83 --> 3739.14
directions gaming movies Netflix chat

3733.18 --> 3739.14
forums so

3743.75 --> 3746.75
well

3747.58 --> 3750.12
you

3764.11 --> 3778.3
doesn't sound like a very viable name

3766.39 --> 3782.68
there Dave Johnson but yeah early-bird

3778.3 --> 3784.51
no no I know I know there's a lot of

3782.68 --> 3788.56
people that have recommend it just

3784.51 --> 3791.9700000000003
ignore it all just let people throw out

3788.56 --> 3797.29
their garbage and just leave it there

3791.97 --> 3802.33
no that was never gonna be my strategy

3797.29 --> 3806.82
I want more interaction I don't want my

3802.33 --> 3810.06
chat to be a dumping ground for mentally

3806.82 --> 3810.06
sick people

3822.34 --> 3832.52
all right so yeah anyway I'm gonna round
