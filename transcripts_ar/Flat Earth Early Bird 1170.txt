and there's less wind

108.56 --> 114.479
and it's like really warm inside here

110.72 --> 116.64
now because the sun was shining in here

114.479 --> 117.439
that's why i'm wearing a t-shirt right

116.64 --> 120.64
now

117.439 --> 123.83999999999999
and not my sweater although

120.64 --> 125.92
i might put it back on

123.84 --> 128.959
somewhere during the show because yeah

125.92 --> 131.75900000000001
the sun is like receding

128.959 --> 131.75900000000001
from my room

134.72 --> 138.0
it's just beautiful

138.16 --> 142.879
bright sunny

140.48 --> 146.23899999999998
clear sky day

142.879 --> 146.239
again on this monday

152.08 --> 155.92000000000002
hello slo-mo moon buggy first in chat

154.239 --> 158.16
and thank you for the paypal you were

155.92 --> 160.95899999999997
part of that i did recognize you

158.16 --> 160.959
stone monkey

161.84 --> 167.84
right it is monday the 28th of february

166.319 --> 170.83999999999997
february

167.84 --> 170.84
2022

171.12 --> 177.12
a little late because i had a pretty

173.92 --> 179.76
late sunday night

177.12 --> 179.76
pretty late

180.72 --> 185.599
so i kind of woke up 15 minutes before

183.04 --> 187.04
one

185.599 --> 189.28
and that's part of the reason why i'm

187.04 --> 189.28
late

189.44 --> 192.239
hey elis g

192.72 --> 197.2
you think you're not sure slow mo move

195.28 --> 200.0
buggy

197.2 --> 203.04
yeah no thanks for that

200.0 --> 206.76
it is like really necessary so

203.04 --> 206.76
i'm very thankful

213.44 --> 216.72
and please keep it coming

217.04 --> 222.64
i might like crawl out of this

219.36 --> 222.64000000000001
temporary death hole

225.12 --> 227.84
all right

232.56 --> 237.12
right and at the same time right now

234.56 --> 237.12
there's some

237.84 --> 241.84
work going on there

242.08 --> 246.239
making a bit of noise i don't know if

243.599 --> 248.48
you're hearing a lot about it but

246.239 --> 252.31900000000002
there's like a

248.48 --> 255.84
crane thing removing a tree there that's

252.319 --> 255.83999999999997
been blown over during the storm

256.479 --> 260.15999999999997
so it's like cutting it up and

262.88 --> 267.199
moving the pieces probably so they could

265.6 --> 270.24
just

267.199 --> 270.24
get rid of it later

274.639 --> 279.40000000000003
hey wrath good to see you

282.44 --> 287.199
[Applause]

285.36 --> 290.24
and i can't believe that february is

287.199 --> 290.24
almost over again

290.72 --> 295.84000000000003
it's the last day of february

293.759 --> 298.47900000000004
sometimes forget that february is a

295.84 --> 298.479
shorter month

302.56 --> 305.56
right

313.68 --> 319.52
so yeah yesterday's show was certainly

317.039 --> 319.52
intense

319.68 --> 325.84000000000003
it's not like

321.28 --> 325.84
loud but it was like tense

331.36 --> 335.91900000000004
like i could have titled it just like

333.28 --> 339.11999999999995
nazis nazis nazis but that i didn't

335.919 --> 341.919
really want to draw that attention to

339.12 --> 341.919
it like that

347.28 --> 351.59999999999997
but it certainly was a whole

349.6 --> 353.84000000000003
a lot of back and forth especially just

351.6 --> 356.0
this weird thing with gordzilla in the

353.84 --> 356.0
end

359.84 --> 363.71999999999997
ah hey davey little

371.199 --> 377.8
right anyway i hope you thought the show

374.0 --> 377.8
yesterday was interesting

380.16 --> 385.44
and again today i feel

382.08 --> 385.44
a bit better again

385.6 --> 390.639
i haven't had any more pain

387.52 --> 392.88
so i did call that and

390.639 --> 394.479
so my body is still kind of recovering

392.88 --> 397.44
but

394.479 --> 397.44
yeah it's just

401.44 --> 405.759
i'm kind of glad to move out of that

403.44 --> 405.759
zone

406.84 --> 415.31899999999996
huh because it's really not freaking

410.24 --> 415.319
pleasant to be like in physical pain

422.0 --> 425.12
i can't really focus

425.36 --> 431.28000000000003
or well i can focus but the focus works

427.759 --> 431.28000000000003
differently and usually

432.16 --> 434.84000000000003
skip

433.12 --> 437.84000000000003
certain

434.84 --> 440.15999999999997
subtleties which i typically when i feel

437.84 --> 442.71999999999997
just good i don't like to skip that's

440.16 --> 443.84000000000003
what i play around with

442.72 --> 446.24
right

443.84 --> 450.88
hence the complaint

446.24 --> 452.40000000000003
from saturday like yeah why why do you

450.88 --> 455.919
why do you put me in the state i can't

452.4 --> 455.919
do what i'm supposed to be doing

456.08 --> 459.599
complain to god i guess

460.96 --> 463.96
anyway

472.96 --> 477.599
i heard in the vines

475.84 --> 478.96
that you had

477.599 --> 481.12
an episode

478.96 --> 482.71999999999997
an episode

481.12 --> 485.199
what

482.72 --> 486.879
no not an episode i just felt

485.199 --> 489.039
really sucky

486.879 --> 490.72
because i was in physical pain

489.039 --> 493.039
and like on the saturday i thought like

490.72 --> 495.44000000000005
oh it's going away and then it kind of

493.039 --> 498.56
came back

495.44 --> 498.56
like during the show

499.199 --> 503.44
and instead of just choosing to like

500.96 --> 505.84
break off the show i thought like no i'm

503.44 --> 508.24
going to

505.84 --> 511.11999999999995
kind of push through it see what happens

508.24 --> 511.12
and that happened

512.32 --> 516.719
but i was definitely like with my

514.479 --> 518.64
feelings i was in a in a pretty tight

516.719 --> 522.9190000000001
spot

518.64 --> 522.919
but yeah doing much better now

534.0 --> 537.68
hey rig back good to see you

545.68 --> 550.64
i've never seen a star set what

550.959 --> 554.3599999999999
what do you mean

568.959 --> 573.7199999999999
hey that flat fellow good to see you

588.56 --> 594.8
yeah right that's right jose

591.839 --> 597.0400000000001
well i mean i think most people are just

594.8 --> 598.8
well the thing about it right about when

597.04 --> 600.88
you're in pain is there's like this

598.8 --> 602.4799999999999
natural instinct especially for a whole

600.88 --> 606.24
lot of men

602.48 --> 608.32
to basically keep it completely private

606.24 --> 612.48
to not like give recognition that it

608.32 --> 615.9200000000001
exists it is like a it's like escapism

612.48 --> 618.9590000000001
as a tactic in response to such a state

615.92 --> 621.519
and that does actually work

618.959 --> 625.1199999999999
for a whole bunch of people

621.519 --> 627.2
this yeah it's complicated because just

625.12 --> 629.92
how we can use our focus in their spirit

627.2 --> 633.279
basically to rearrange how the energy

629.92 --> 635.279
flows in our body and if you literally

633.279 --> 637.4399999999999
completely

635.279 --> 639.4399999999999
like put it in a corner

637.44 --> 641.6800000000001
for your sensories

639.44 --> 643.6800000000001
then that can kind of work to ignore it

641.68 --> 645.519
so when i yeah

643.68 --> 648.079
i normally do that

645.519 --> 649.6
right when i'm out here i don't start

648.079 --> 650.64
like ah

649.6 --> 653.36
never

650.64 --> 655.68
but on my show i do actually take the

653.36 --> 658.32
opportunity to kind of like well use it

655.68 --> 661.519
as a study

658.32 --> 664.72
use it as a study opportunity

661.519 --> 667.12
right i am also here for the psychology

664.72 --> 667.12
a lot

669.76 --> 673.0
all right

686.0 --> 689.839
yeah that's on

701.36 --> 705.22
you hold it in too long hurts inside

703.44 --> 707.2
yeah well that's right

705.22 --> 708.8000000000001
[Music]

707.2 --> 711.44
when you're on your own and you got to

708.8 --> 713.3599999999999
kind of find those moments to be on your

711.44 --> 715.6800000000001
own you got to eventually confront it

713.36 --> 718.5600000000001
it's just that in your normal going

715.68 --> 720.3199999999999
about you don't complain

718.56 --> 722.16
to other people about it unless you're

720.32 --> 724.48
like you're a gamma

722.16 --> 726.399
or well even gammas typically don't do

724.48 --> 727.6800000000001
that they then just start projecting

726.399 --> 729.6
their misery

727.68 --> 730.4799999999999
on others instead

729.6 --> 733.279
right

730.48 --> 735.76
so typically for example when nathan

733.279 --> 737.76
says share your pain when trolls are

735.76 --> 740.24
like very very very rare

737.76 --> 742.639
right that is actually

740.24 --> 746.5600000000001
a lot of the times you could probably

742.639 --> 750.8
prove or inquire and figure out

746.56 --> 750.8
well then it is actual pain

751.44 --> 754.8000000000001
that drives that behavior

755.04 --> 757.279
right

757.36 --> 764.32
oh i learned to really confront pain a

760.399 --> 767.68
lot i kind of had to learn that

764.32 --> 767.6800000000001
because i'm very sensitive

769.04 --> 774.48
and it's very difficult to keep avoiding

771.76 --> 777.36
it like with me if i try to ignore pain

774.48 --> 780.0790000000001
completely like use that escapism tool

777.36 --> 782.32
to just ignore it

780.079 --> 784.6389999999999
it tends to have like terrible backlash

782.32 --> 784.639
on me

785.519 --> 790.0
but that's because i'm just really

787.6 --> 791.279
sensitive and just freaky [ __ ] starts to

790.0 --> 793.279
happen

791.279 --> 795.4399999999999
so i i kind of always have to confront

793.279 --> 798.56
it

795.44 --> 800.9590000000001
like when i was younger

798.56 --> 804.079
i had so much more energy and i could

800.959 --> 807.1999999999999
just like put it aside but even then

804.079 --> 807.1999999999999
things would go wrong

809.519 --> 812.88
like a

810.8 --> 814.959
save the dream what

812.88 --> 816.079
no it's a blown over tree during the

814.959 --> 819.76
storm

816.079 --> 819.76
from yeah from this month

820.0 --> 824.32
and they're just cutting it up for

821.68 --> 824.3199999999999
transport

827.519 --> 829.839
uh

830.399 --> 836.24
hey steamy traveler new shirt no

833.76 --> 837.76
no no no absolutely not but i am not

836.24 --> 839.279
wearing a sweater because it was kind of

837.76 --> 840.72
hot in here

839.279 --> 844.639
today

840.72 --> 846.32
with the sun hitting hitting in my room

844.639 --> 849.04
but yeah it is

846.32 --> 850.5600000000001
as you can see behind me it is receding

849.04 --> 852.24
the the sun

850.56 --> 854.079
angle is turning

852.24 --> 856.24
like outside of my room and it is

854.079 --> 858.2399999999999
getting a little cooler here so i might

856.24 --> 860.0790000000001
do even during the show put my sweater

858.24 --> 861.6800000000001
back on

860.079 --> 864.079
or or not

861.68 --> 864.079
we'll see

869.04 --> 873.24
the rv stream what

892.56 --> 896.88
okay this g i'm checking out your link

894.639 --> 898.639
what is that

896.88 --> 900.079
oh that

898.639 --> 902.8
that

900.079 --> 905.279
hilarious

902.8 --> 906.959
yeah that's a trick

905.279 --> 909.04
at least g that's an older trick

906.959 --> 910.7199999999999
actually

909.04 --> 913.4399999999999
you see

910.72 --> 915.279
when you look at it really carefully you

913.44 --> 917.0400000000001
will notice

915.279 --> 919.92
that it's not actually a complete

917.04 --> 921.8389999999999
triangle neither one of them like the

919.92 --> 923.5999999999999
the two different colored parts the blue

921.839 --> 926.8000000000001
and the red

923.6 --> 930.399
they don't have exactly the same angle

926.8 --> 931.7589999999999
but because of the color arrangement

930.399 --> 934.079
your

931.759 --> 935.759
geometric

934.079 --> 939.04
yeah the

935.759 --> 940.72
your mind warps it a little

939.04 --> 944.639
because of the two different colored

940.72 --> 947.1990000000001
parts you can't really see it on a flash

944.639 --> 948.9590000000001
that it's not exactly a perfect

947.199 --> 951.199
straight line when you combine them but

948.959 --> 953.8389999999999
if you look really really carefully and

951.199 --> 956.959
you can measure it also you can deduce

953.839 --> 958.24
it based on the square background

956.959 --> 960.3199999999999
right

958.24 --> 962.44
is that

960.32 --> 964.24
it's actually your visual

962.44 --> 967.759
misinterpretation that it is a

964.24 --> 970.5600000000001
consistent triangle either one right

967.759 --> 970.5600000000001
that's the trick

970.72 --> 973.6800000000001
it's a visual trick

976.48 --> 983.519
i actually have a picture of that image

979.839 --> 986.5600000000001
on my computer from like 20 years ago

983.519 --> 986.5600000000001
see if i can find it

991.839 --> 996.48
yeah here it is

993.759 --> 1000.12
it's exactly that

996.48 --> 1000.12
let me show you

1014.639 --> 1017.639
oh

1024.0 --> 1026.559
come on

1026.88 --> 1029.88
what

1039.36 --> 1041.76
right

1046.24 --> 1050.64
so see

1047.919 --> 1050.64
the same one

1051.2 --> 1054.559
let's just look up close

1058.32 --> 1060.6399999999999
that

1059.12 --> 1062.6399999999999
on the top

1060.64 --> 1064.24
triangle

1062.64 --> 1066.4
the green one

1064.24 --> 1068.24
is two by five

1066.4 --> 1070.5590000000002
the bottom one

1068.24 --> 1073.2
is three

1070.559 --> 1073.2
by eight

1076.16 --> 1079.16
see

1084.08 --> 1087.52
but because

1085.52 --> 1089.679
like if you're color blind there is a

1087.52 --> 1092.08
chance that you will immediately see

1089.679 --> 1095.8400000000001
through it because you don't distinguish

1092.08 --> 1095.84
red from green with this

1100.96 --> 1107.0
right anyway

1102.72 --> 1107.0
so that's been around for a while

1126.24 --> 1132.76
boo to a goose what

1129.36 --> 1132.76
hello youtube

1153.36 --> 1157.76
that guy on globe buster's going to the

1155.2 --> 1160.64
north pole really

1157.76 --> 1163.12
really okay david little

1160.64 --> 1165.8400000000001
sure is he's taking his accident well he

1163.12 --> 1165.84
should

1177.039 --> 1182.0
oh really flat fell that's annoying you

1179.2 --> 1184.48
got an you got a troll stalker or like

1182.0 --> 1184.48
somebody

1184.799 --> 1189.4
acting like you that's really annoying

1193.84 --> 1196.08
uh

1196.96 --> 1199.96
what

1210.159 --> 1214.3200000000002
what

1211.919 --> 1214.3200000000002
false

1215.76 --> 1219.2
except maybe for the

1218.159 --> 1222.64
what is it

1219.2 --> 1224.72
for the elevation angle like

1222.64 --> 1226.0800000000002
you have to correct

1224.72 --> 1228.48
for that but that's because of the

1226.08 --> 1232.0
height of the observer but if you're

1228.48 --> 1234.4
pretty much standing at at sea level or

1232.0 --> 1237.12
ground level it's going to be 180

1234.4 --> 1237.1200000000001
degrees jose

1245.12 --> 1249.1589999999999
on the flat earth by the way

1250.24 --> 1252.96
great you said if the earth was a globe

1252.159 --> 1254.48
right

1252.96 --> 1257.52
will it be over

1254.48 --> 1260.159
well it should be

1257.52 --> 1262.96
if the earth was a globe which it isn't

1260.159 --> 1266.0800000000002
so it never is

1262.96 --> 1270.039
more than 180 degrees

1266.08 --> 1270.039
except for the dip correction

1277.52 --> 1280.0
and what

1281.36 --> 1287.559
really youtube that's hilarious

1284.32 --> 1287.559
from 2018

1288.72 --> 1293.919
holy [ __ ]

1290.559 --> 1297.28
did you inform nathan about that

1293.919 --> 1298.0800000000002
that would be really funny to

1297.28 --> 1301.6399999999999
to

1298.08 --> 1301.6399999999999
go over that

1315.039 --> 1318.039
huh

1325.039 --> 1328.96
ah

1327.36 --> 1333.3999999999999
right

1328.96 --> 1333.4
take two minute break i'll be right back

1472.799 --> 1475.12
yo

1482.88 --> 1488.72
oh man if you guys are already like this

1485.36 --> 1491.279
in in my in my early birth chat

1488.72 --> 1493.2
then it's probably gonna be a pretty

1491.279 --> 1494.48
heavy day on the flat earth debates

1493.2 --> 1497.279
today

1494.48 --> 1497.279
i suspect

1497.36 --> 1500.52
all right

1502.159 --> 1505.96
probably going to be a blast

1519.679 --> 1525.8400000000001
i'd love to take a rumpus to my pub

1523.2 --> 1525.8400000000001
oh really

1526.64 --> 1531.5200000000002
well you could probably just find him in

1528.88 --> 1533.3600000000001
discord or something david little i mean

1531.52 --> 1536.559
you don't actually have to physically

1533.36 --> 1536.559
get him into a pub

1540.159 --> 1543.1200000000001
i don't know if he's a pop kind of guy

1542.08 --> 1545.1999999999998
even

1543.12 --> 1548.08
i don't know a lot about

1545.2 --> 1551.3600000000001
like rompus's personal life he

1548.08 --> 1554.08
he rarely gets into personal preferences

1551.36 --> 1557.84
although sometimes he does

1554.08 --> 1557.84
but not a lot of details

1568.64 --> 1574.3200000000002
even you are bawling

1571.52 --> 1574.32
right jose

1579.36 --> 1584.1589999999999
but look the tension on the ball versus

1581.679 --> 1586.0800000000002
flat earth has been on for quite a while

1584.159 --> 1587.7600000000002
especially since we discovered that it

1586.08 --> 1589.1999999999998
is absolutely

1587.76 --> 1591.6
mathematically

1589.2 --> 1593.039
geometrically

1591.6 --> 1595.36
logically

1593.039 --> 1598.0
through design

1595.36 --> 1599.36
system logic and all that back

1598.0 --> 1602.159
engineering

1599.36 --> 1604.7199999999998
that the ball earth model is based on a

1602.159 --> 1606.0
flat plane

1604.72 --> 1607.6000000000001
yeah that's

1606.0 --> 1609.52
upped the tension for a while some

1607.6 --> 1610.84
anti-flat earthers have already gone

1609.52 --> 1615.52
completely

1610.84 --> 1619.279
insane they've gone to like full

1615.52 --> 1621.76
almost like sjw style double think

1619.279 --> 1624.24
complete derangement

1621.76 --> 1624.24
ideas

1624.96 --> 1628.0
where they literally

1626.64 --> 1630.7990000000002
like don't know what the hell they're

1628.0 --> 1630.799
doing anymore

1632.08 --> 1637.039
so yeah then when the energy gets high

1634.88 --> 1641.279
enough then suddenly everybody's all

1637.039 --> 1643.52
really like ready to go at it

1641.279 --> 1646.399
so yeah it could be an interesting day i

1643.52 --> 1649.12
suspect there will probably be

1646.399 --> 1651.6
a couple of anti-flat earthers getting

1649.12 --> 1653.36
in through discord

1651.6 --> 1656.32
and nathan telling them to suck his

1653.36 --> 1656.32
balls eventually

1656.559 --> 1661.36
maybe

1658.799 --> 1661.36
probably

1664.399 --> 1667.7199999999998
hey crockett

1675.2 --> 1677.919
if it's not in a book he doesn't think

1677.2 --> 1680.48
it

1677.919 --> 1683.48
yeah i've suspected that too

1680.48 --> 1683.48
youtube

1707.76 --> 1714.72
there's no map showing your well a map

1712.32 --> 1716.24
is an exploration

1714.72 --> 1720.279
device

1716.24 --> 1720.279
it's not a model jose

1727.919 --> 1732.48
it's just a projection every every map

1730.559 --> 1733.76
is

1732.48 --> 1737.76
right

1733.76 --> 1741.2
and if we are potentially facing a

1737.76 --> 1743.279
impossible geometric puzzle in a way

1741.2 --> 1745.919
it could be the case although i kind of

1743.279 --> 1749.52
doubt it but yeah spatial non-linearity

1745.919 --> 1750.5590000000002
could make it so a flat globe effect

1749.52 --> 1752.48
what are you going to do how are you

1750.559 --> 1754.72
going to represent something that is all

1752.48 --> 1756.08
perfectly flat but interconnects like as

1754.72 --> 1758.0
if it is a globe what are you going to

1756.08 --> 1760.0
do you know how are you going to present

1758.0 --> 1762.399
that like oh

1760.0 --> 1764.88
let's make an art class project today

1762.399 --> 1767.6789999999999
we're going to actually

1764.88 --> 1769.1200000000001
make a physical model of what the earth

1767.679 --> 1770.64
exactly is

1769.12 --> 1773.039
good luck

1770.64 --> 1775.1200000000001
and yeah nobody will be able to succeed

1773.039 --> 1777.2
because how do you

1775.12 --> 1779.4399999999998
do that

1777.2 --> 1781.279
you're gonna have to like do the same

1779.44 --> 1783.8400000000001
thing as

1781.279 --> 1787.039
the map projections

1783.84 --> 1787.039
and choose a

1787.279 --> 1792.72
yeah an

1789.279 --> 1795.279
even out representation of some kind

1792.72 --> 1798.0
right which is what map projections are

1795.279 --> 1800.799
they're like even out

1798.0 --> 1802.799
made uniform

1800.799 --> 1804.1589999999999
so that you could have like a yeah a

1802.799 --> 1806.32
cohesive

1804.159 --> 1809.6000000000001
oversight with it

1806.32 --> 1813.12
but the in reality it isn't

1809.6 --> 1815.36
in reality it's all flat but it just

1813.12 --> 1816.6399999999999
like there's things that are not

1815.36 --> 1817.9189999999999
logically

1816.64 --> 1820.159
possible

1817.919 --> 1823.039
geometrically

1820.159 --> 1824.7990000000002
how everything orientates if the

1823.039 --> 1827.36
information we've been handed about it

1824.799 --> 1827.36
is correct

1827.919 --> 1833.039
right

1829.36 --> 1835.1999999999998
like the dude does the land south of the

1833.039 --> 1837.44
equator actually fit

1835.2 --> 1839.8400000000001
outside of the equator if it is a

1837.44 --> 1843.76
perfect ring

1839.84 --> 1846.08
does the land inside of the ink or north

1843.76 --> 1848.72
of the equator

1846.08 --> 1850.48
if the equator was a ring actually fit

1848.72 --> 1852.559
within that limited

1850.48 --> 1854.88
circle geometrically right all these

1852.559 --> 1854.8799999999999
things

1854.96 --> 1858.0
or like

1856.08 --> 1859.4399999999998
the rectangular map

1858.0 --> 1860.88
even

1859.44 --> 1863.519
does it

1860.88 --> 1865.8400000000001
actually fit i mean i don't think it's

1863.519 --> 1867.919
like perfectly rectangular

1865.84 --> 1869.84
but i do think that's probably like if

1867.919 --> 1871.6000000000001
there's spatial looping going on and

1869.84 --> 1873.6
especially non-linearity that's the best

1871.6 --> 1875.519
way to represent it to just to

1873.6 --> 1879.84
understand what's going on

1875.519 --> 1879.84
and to emphasize the looping factor

1879.919 --> 1886.24
right but it's still a projection

1884.24 --> 1888.88
so like how are you going to make a

1886.24 --> 1891.2
physical literal representation of the

1888.88 --> 1895.679
earth's surface

1891.2 --> 1895.679
it's like you don't know how

1896.08 --> 1902.29
that's why we got that projections

1898.46 --> 1902.29
[Laughter]

1916.24 --> 1922.08
without gravity the ball cannot exist at

1918.799 --> 1925.519
all well tony whitcomb do not

1922.08 --> 1928.0
underestimate the creative dynamic range

1925.519 --> 1930.72
of possibilities that comes with

1928.0 --> 1933.6
globe religion

1930.72 --> 1935.44
there's a lot of things possible tony

1933.6 --> 1938.7199999999998
there's a lot of ways that

1935.44 --> 1940.159
the ball can be made to work within

1938.72 --> 1942.48
fictional

1940.159 --> 1943.6000000000001
within a fictional setup

1942.48 --> 1945.3600000000001
right

1943.6 --> 1946.24
i literally just

1945.36 --> 1949.12
pull

1946.24 --> 1950.0
entire systems out of my sleeve on a

1949.12 --> 1952.0
whim

1950.0 --> 1954.48
literally it like literally just

1952.0 --> 1956.64
manifests just like that

1954.48 --> 1956.64
so

1958.399 --> 1964.559
a ball could definitely be

1961.6 --> 1966.399
invented to work even without gravity or

1964.559 --> 1967.84
well depends on what type of gravity

1966.399 --> 1969.84
right because

1967.84 --> 1972.08
newtonian gravity yeah for sure that

1969.84 --> 1977.6
doesn't make sense right they discard it

1972.08 --> 1980.96
but einstein gravity well it's like a

1977.6 --> 1982.6399999999999
clean white canvas it is like

1980.96 --> 1985.6000000000001
artistically

1982.64 --> 1988.0800000000002
creatively einstein gravity is like a

1985.6 --> 1990.48
clean slate you can literally do with it

1988.08 --> 1992.08
whatever the [ __ ] you want

1990.48 --> 1993.679
because

1992.08 --> 1996.399
of its

1993.679 --> 1998.24
mathematical arrangement

1996.399 --> 2000.7199999999998
because it cannot

1998.24 --> 2002.88
calculate for more than one one body of

2000.72 --> 2006.159
attraction you can never make a unified

2002.88 --> 2007.44
model out of it which leaves

2006.159 --> 2010.64
designers

2007.44 --> 2012.3990000000001
automated mechanism like with newtonian

2010.64 --> 2015.3200000000002
gravity leaves that completely out of

2012.399 --> 2018.32
the loop henceforth whatever

2015.32 --> 2021.36
infrastructure is envisioned for the

2018.32 --> 2024.799
galactic motions and everything

2021.36 --> 2029.1999999999998
is purely up for design

2024.799 --> 2032.48
there is no automated pattern

2029.2 --> 2034.88
right newtonian gravity gave

2032.48 --> 2036.88
a grip on an automated pattern that

2034.88 --> 2038.7990000000002
could unify it all

2036.88 --> 2040.96
simultaneously and then didn't really

2038.799 --> 2042.8799999999999
work out right that's why we had dark

2040.96 --> 2045.039
matter and dark energy and all that to

2042.88 --> 2047.6000000000001
compensate for the mathematical

2045.039 --> 2050.72
error that came out of it but there was

2047.6 --> 2055.04
a unified method well einstein gravity

2050.72 --> 2057.2
doesn't provide a unified pattern system

2055.04 --> 2060.679
so it's left up

2057.2 --> 2060.6789999999996
to the artist

2060.72 --> 2066.7999999999997
right the designer of the concept

2064.0 --> 2068.48
to do with it as they

2066.8 --> 2070.7200000000003
envision

2068.48 --> 2073.28
it's a clean slate it's

2070.72 --> 2076.399
it's a white canvas einstein gravity is

2073.28 --> 2078.48
a white canvas for the universe

2076.399 --> 2080.96
and i've already started to experiment

2078.48 --> 2083.76
with it a little with my conception of

2080.96 --> 2085.679
like how einstein gravity

2083.76 --> 2088.159
arranged

2085.679 --> 2090.0
the planetary bodies and everything the

2088.159 --> 2092.159
way it is

2090.0 --> 2096.0
or it's presumed to be

2092.159 --> 2098.56
the way it is presumed to be right

2096.0 --> 2098.56
so yeah

2101.52 --> 2105.44
not scientific yet no of course not

2105.68 --> 2111.2
but there would never even be scientific

2108.32 --> 2112.4
evidence of any of that globe stuff

2111.2 --> 2114.56
the whole

2112.4 --> 2117.599
situation

2114.56 --> 2121.839
that globers or globe or

2117.599 --> 2123.76
spurs travel claimed science

2121.839 --> 2126.88
that was the problem

2123.76 --> 2129.119
it wasn't the problem

2126.88 --> 2129.119
well

2129.52 --> 2134.079
they'd just created a problem by

2131.839 --> 2136.16
claiming science

2134.079 --> 2137.92
it would have never been science because

2136.16 --> 2141.359
science established the cause of an

2137.92 --> 2145.839
effect it doesn't establish what is

2141.359 --> 2145.839
so it wasn't ever science right

2146.079 --> 2151.119
so even saying oh globe isn't science

2148.88 --> 2154.32
doesn't even address that their entire

2151.119 --> 2154.32
system is based on

2155.04 --> 2159.839
on fallacies every every part of the way

2158.16 --> 2161.7599999999998
and there's no mechanical logical

2159.839 --> 2163.52
consistency natural laws are being

2161.76 --> 2166.079
ignored a whole bunch of things are

2163.52 --> 2169.44
being ignored in favor or there's like

2166.079 --> 2169.44
data cherry picking

2169.599 --> 2175.3590000000004
to favor proof

2171.52 --> 2175.359
for a concept right

2175.44 --> 2181.04
but it was never science

2178.16 --> 2181.04
like even if they

2181.28 --> 2185.0400000000004
if they had

2182.96 --> 2188.64
yeah well they don't have the science

2185.04 --> 2190.16
method correct of course nobody in

2188.64 --> 2191.359
their field

2190.16 --> 2195.68
understand

2191.359 --> 2195.68
applies the scientific method right

2197.28 --> 2202.1600000000003
but them calling

2199.28 --> 2203.92
themselves like this the scientists and

2202.16 --> 2205.2
having a body of science science

2203.92 --> 2207.44
authority

2205.2 --> 2210.56
that was kind of the more egregious

2207.44 --> 2212.64
problem a culturally deranging

2210.56 --> 2214.48
problem

2212.64 --> 2216.96
the problem is that they call themselves

2214.48 --> 2219.119
scientists it's a more upfront problem

2216.96 --> 2221.68
even than the cohesion of the entire

2219.119 --> 2221.6800000000003
religion

2223.04 --> 2229.52
right and we've already seen it like

2225.76 --> 2231.5200000000004
burrow itself further

2229.52 --> 2235.119
and that's why now like

2231.52 --> 2237.599
completely blatantly lying bastard

2235.119 --> 2239.359
anti-human pieces of [ __ ]

2237.599 --> 2242.1600000000003
claim they have the science and they

2239.359 --> 2244.0
just need to stick to the science it's

2242.16 --> 2245.7599999999998
just become a

2244.0 --> 2248.4
pseudonym for

2245.76 --> 2250.7200000000003
whatever they say you're supposed to

2248.4 --> 2250.7200000000003
believe

2252.4 --> 2256.2400000000002
so

2253.359 --> 2258.0789999999997
right addressing signs and for what it

2256.24 --> 2260.64
really is the method

2258.079 --> 2263.28
is kind of important now for humanity's

2260.64 --> 2265.1189999999997
survival you could argue right it's a

2263.28 --> 2266.6400000000003
cultural problem that's grown out of

2265.119 --> 2269.28
hand

2266.64 --> 2273.04
like in the world right now not just

2269.28 --> 2273.0400000000004
like flat earth on the internet

2279.04 --> 2282.48
it's funny they claim up and down is

2280.8 --> 2285.8390000000004
relative well that's just

2282.48 --> 2285.839
it's just playground stuff

2286.16 --> 2290.24
right

2287.599 --> 2291.76
like if it all was like that yeah up and

2290.24 --> 2295.64
down is relative no

2291.76 --> 2295.6400000000003
yeah sure why not

2341.76 --> 2346.48
proof and evidence are different oh

2343.28 --> 2346.48
that's really important

2346.72 --> 2350.64
is it is it really important in the

2349.119 --> 2352.96
context of

2350.64 --> 2354.56
the entire conversation

2352.96 --> 2356.88
lydia logs

2354.56 --> 2356.88
is it

2361.119 --> 2364.76
hello by the way snowbirds

2381.76 --> 2385.5200000000004
hello by the way speed reader

2385.76 --> 2388.76
hmm

2403.119 --> 2409.2000000000003
oh wow i even missed that little

2406.4 --> 2411.76
that that little troll turret there from

2409.2 --> 2413.68
them versus them versus us

2411.76 --> 2415.28
what the [ __ ]

2413.68 --> 2417.52
that's hilarious

2415.28 --> 2418.96
it's so funny

2417.52 --> 2421.839
i mean

2418.96 --> 2424.64
i used to act like that too you know

2421.839 --> 2428.24
when i was 12.

2424.64 --> 2428.24
maybe he is 12 i don't know

2440.96 --> 2443.96
so

2458.88 --> 2462.2000000000003
hey gordzilla

2467.68 --> 2471.9199999999996
uh i don't think they're here to

2469.359 --> 2474.88
convince anybody godzilla

2471.92 --> 2477.2000000000003
it's it's odd that you say that

2474.88 --> 2480.6400000000003
you should know better than that by now

2477.2 --> 2483.52
like globers don't come in

2480.64 --> 2486.0789999999997
chats or anywhere to convince anybody

2483.52 --> 2487.839
else they come in there to defend their

2486.079 --> 2489.28
own religion they're there to convince

2487.839 --> 2491.7599999999998
themselves

2489.28 --> 2494.0
they're not there to pull you to their

2491.76 --> 2498.44
side

2494.0 --> 2498.44
they know that that doesn't work

2526.64 --> 2530.7999999999997
yeah flatter city well yeah but isn't

2528.64 --> 2533.359
that just

2530.8 --> 2538.0
it's bureaucracy right it's the

2533.359 --> 2538.0
bureaucracy of the information details

2538.319 --> 2543.68
and they apply it very eloquently

2541.68 --> 2545.5989999999997
which is extremely aggravating by the

2543.68 --> 2548.16
way if you actually want a serious

2545.599 --> 2548.1600000000003
inquiry

2548.8 --> 2552.48
but yeah of course they will move on to

2551.68 --> 2553.9199999999996
like

2552.48 --> 2556.72
instead of

2553.92 --> 2559.76
discussing the egregious fallacy or

2556.72 --> 2563.04
error in everybody's face it will move

2559.76 --> 2565.44
on to little details or like oh no you

2563.04 --> 2566.24
don't understand what i mean

2565.44 --> 2570.48
or

2566.24 --> 2572.319
no you misunderstand that word

2570.48 --> 2574.4
and then like move

2572.319 --> 2576.4
like way out of the scope of the

2574.4 --> 2578.56
original discovery of the fallacy that

2576.4 --> 2581.52
undoes it all right and they don't even

2578.56 --> 2583.599
end up correcting for that mistake they

2581.52 --> 2584.56
just move their attention away from it

2583.599 --> 2588.56
that's

2584.56 --> 2588.56
the bureaucracy like effect

2591.28 --> 2594.96
that works so well

2592.88 --> 2597.44
in a live discussion right you point out

2594.96 --> 2600.56
an egregious error they immediately move

2597.44 --> 2603.2000000000003
into nitpicking about details

2600.56 --> 2604.88
and then if you go with them to see if

2603.2 --> 2607.9199999999996
it leads anywhere

2604.88 --> 2609.76
you end up like oh yeah now we agree on

2607.92 --> 2610.96
this little detail

2609.76 --> 2612.96
but

2610.96 --> 2615.2
like the entire

2612.96 --> 2617.839
previous pointing out of the entire

2615.2 --> 2619.839
argument being completely broken

2617.839 --> 2623.2
is kind of forgotten and that's exactly

2619.839 --> 2626.319
what they wanted i as baldwin apply this

2623.2 --> 2629.2
automatically i don't

2626.319 --> 2630.88
you see when i'm baldwin i don't plan

2629.2 --> 2633.52
things

2630.88 --> 2636.8
it's pure intuition

2633.52 --> 2636.8
it's just a mechanism

2641.92 --> 2646.96
it's like a game

2644.48 --> 2649.44
and you respond with the right impulses

2646.96 --> 2651.68
at the right moment and you learn to

2649.44 --> 2654.64
sense them out

2651.68 --> 2658.319
it's almost like sub communication

2654.64 --> 2658.319
communication behind the words

2660.96 --> 2667.359
and the really good globe wizards know

2663.2 --> 2667.359
how to do that part perfectly

2671.2 --> 2675.1189999999997
borwin

2673.44 --> 2676.48
uh speed read i don't know if you're new

2675.119 --> 2679.119
here

2676.48 --> 2683.04
but yeah on the flat earth debates i

2679.119 --> 2683.04
sometimes go into ball win mode

2683.359 --> 2686.72
and i start to justify

2687.359 --> 2693.119
certain elements about the ball right

2690.96 --> 2695.2
i'm pretty much at this point the only

2693.119 --> 2698.079
one that's even virtually

2695.2 --> 2701.52
brought forth some way some halfway

2698.079 --> 2701.52
cohesive arguments

2701.92 --> 2705.76
for example why

2703.68 --> 2709.2
there's no geometric

2705.76 --> 2711.8390000000004
sphere edge why the horizon isn't

2709.2 --> 2713.839
geometric when you look at it and work

2711.839 --> 2715.68
with that and how the sextant can work

2713.839 --> 2717.359
on an apparent flat plane and still

2715.68 --> 2720.3999999999996
prove a globe like

2717.359 --> 2722.4
but it is very deep

2720.4 --> 2724.1600000000003
within psychological mechanics so it's

2722.4 --> 2726.64
never like what i do is never going to

2724.16 --> 2728.56
be like the ultimate universal method

2726.64 --> 2730.96
that all the ballers will just easily

2728.56 --> 2733.119
apply because it requires you to get a

2730.96 --> 2737.839
really heavy

2733.119 --> 2737.839
oversight it's gonna that's strainful

2737.92 --> 2742.7200000000003
and most people that will like try to

2740.0 --> 2744.88
follow it will already bump into

2742.72 --> 2747.839
understanding why the entire thing is

2744.88 --> 2747.839
actually false

2748.0 --> 2753.04
that's why most just don't do that

2750.64 --> 2755.2
they rather just go in their own little

2753.04 --> 2756.8
double think

2755.2 --> 2758.319
micro corner

2756.8 --> 2760.319
which makes them seem a lot more

2758.319 --> 2764.92
ignorant

2760.319 --> 2766.8
but they will be facing less

2764.92 --> 2768.8
incontroversible

2766.8 --> 2770.079
evidence for the failure of their

2768.8 --> 2773.04
religion

2770.079 --> 2775.28
which is their priority

2773.04 --> 2776.8
the anti-flat earther priority to

2775.28 --> 2780.2400000000002
prevent

2776.8 --> 2782.5600000000004
insight on how you're wrong

2780.24 --> 2784.0789999999997
like that's the main priority

2782.56 --> 2787.359
right

2784.079 --> 2790.6400000000003
they do what they do not to convince us

2787.359 --> 2792.72
to convince themselves to keep them in

2790.64 --> 2794.64
the zone to prevent themselves from

2792.72 --> 2798.04
accidentally learning that which they

2794.64 --> 2798.04
cannot handle

2805.839 --> 2812.92
you don't usually agree

2808.64 --> 2812.92
kakumovar that's just arrogant

2816.4 --> 2822.1600000000003
you don't have the luxury not to agree

2819.359 --> 2824.319
you don't have any other grip i'm the

2822.16 --> 2827.92
only one that's actually figured out in

2824.319 --> 2829.599
how to make this halfway tenable

2827.92 --> 2833.52
with the red i'm the only one that's

2829.599 --> 2835.6800000000003
actually master terrestrial refraction

2833.52 --> 2838.64
which is a pure spell it's a machination

2835.68 --> 2838.64
i've mastered it

2839.2 --> 2843.04
i mean i can't write it down

2840.88 --> 2844.4
mathematically but i know exactly what

2843.04 --> 2845.7599999999998
it is

2844.4 --> 2848.319
how it's there

2845.76 --> 2851.0400000000004
what it function is

2848.319 --> 2852.4
and what the natural consequences would

2851.04 --> 2854.96
actually be

2852.4 --> 2856.4
i have a very good oversight in this and

2854.96 --> 2858.7200000000003
that's pretty unique i don't think

2856.4 --> 2860.48
rumpus even has this level of oversight

2858.72 --> 2862.24
although now that i've said it if he

2860.48 --> 2864.079
picks up on that he might suddenly get

2862.24 --> 2866.16
like what no

2864.079 --> 2868.88
no or he doesn't know what he's talking

2866.16 --> 2870.48
about i have actually mathematically

2868.88 --> 2872.88
written down

2870.48 --> 2874.96
an attempt to actually formulate

2872.88 --> 2877.119
terrestrial fracture i bet he has right

2874.96 --> 2878.319
he is a good math guy

2877.119 --> 2880.48
i am not

2878.319 --> 2882.8
but i understand exactly what it is

2880.48 --> 2882.8
though

2884.8 --> 2887.8
um

2920.64 --> 2924.0789999999997
i don't think like them

2925.2 --> 2929.52
uh

2927.119 --> 2932.0
i don't think like the rest of the flat

2929.52 --> 2932.0
earthers

2933.359 --> 2938.4
well i do i just don't see any necessity

2936.16 --> 2939.68
for expressing that

2938.4 --> 2942.64
right

2939.68 --> 2945.04
i think that's kind of like

2942.64 --> 2946.0
a bit cowish behavior

2945.04 --> 2947.52
ooh

2946.0 --> 2949.359
just stating that blatantly obviously

2947.52 --> 2952.319
like oh the ball is false the balls yeah

2949.359 --> 2954.0
it's like hello

2952.319 --> 2957.319
you really need to keep saying that

2954.0 --> 2957.319
every time

2957.52 --> 2961.7599999999998
like that's kind of obvious by now it's

2959.76 --> 2963.92
it's not about whether it's false or not

2961.76 --> 2965.92
it's about like how is it false what's

2963.92 --> 2967.839
actually being thought out how is the

2965.92 --> 2971.839
train of thinking working how's the

2967.839 --> 2974.0789999999997
mechanism set up how do people deal

2971.839 --> 2976.24
with that mechanism if they believe in

2974.079 --> 2976.2400000000002
it

2976.48 --> 2980.88
that's my priority it's just getting

2978.72 --> 2982.24
through it i don't care like somebody

2980.88 --> 2985.359
doesn't need to point out to me like

2982.24 --> 2988.319
that's false well although

2985.359 --> 2991.2
if i would by accident assume that some

2988.319 --> 2993.839
kind of a mechanism or piece of data or

2991.2 --> 2995.9199999999996
whatever was official

2993.839 --> 2997.52
and it turns out that it wasn't that

2995.92 --> 2999.52
like for example

2997.52 --> 3002.0
not a good example

2999.52 --> 3004.319
but it is an example

3002.0 --> 3006.72
what if i didn't know terrestrial

3004.319 --> 3008.8
refraction it was actually a pure

3006.72 --> 3010.5589999999997
machination if i'd actually still

3008.8 --> 3013.3590000000004
thought like no that's actually a real

3010.559 --> 3015.92
thing right

3013.359 --> 3015.92
well i'm

3016.0 --> 3023.48
there to basically figure out

3018.72 --> 3023.48
ah now this is not a cohesive sentence

3033.68 --> 3037.839
i don't know how to express this

3035.92 --> 3039.92
but i'm always i'm not i don't really

3037.839 --> 3041.68
care yeah i care to be pointed out if

3039.92 --> 3043.92
something is wrong

3041.68 --> 3046.0789999999997
if my assumptions about something's

3043.92 --> 3049.28
background is wrong now i know i

3046.079 --> 3049.28
remember what i wanted to say

3051.44 --> 3055.839
but i don't need to be constantly

3054.0 --> 3058.8
reminded of that it's not like i'm gonna

3055.839 --> 3061.2
i'm gonna forget

3058.8 --> 3062.88
once i figured out like the true nature

3061.2 --> 3067.04
of something like once i figured out

3062.88 --> 3067.04
what terrestrial refraction actually was

3067.2 --> 3070.3999999999996
like after that point i can never forget

3069.44 --> 3073.52
it

3070.4 --> 3073.52
because i yeah

3074.48 --> 3078.88
it's really important

3076.079 --> 3081.04
it's like a a key factor in the whole

3078.88 --> 3083.599
development process of what's what's

3081.04 --> 3084.48
going down in the flat earth versus

3083.599 --> 3087.92
globe

3084.48 --> 3087.92
philosophical argument

3090.88 --> 3098.1600000000003
and i'm using it as

3093.52 --> 3098.16
as my baller simulator baldwin

3102.24 --> 3107.1189999999997
although yeah balwin isn't just a baller

3104.8 --> 3109.92
simulator

3107.119 --> 3111.52
he is me from the past which is not like

3109.92 --> 3114.48
what ballers are

3111.52 --> 3117.52
in the past i knew ballers

3114.48 --> 3120.8
and i freaking couldn't stand them

3117.52 --> 3122.64
yeah because 20 years ago and more

3120.8 --> 3125.119
ballers were

3122.64 --> 3126.0789999999997
just like ballers are now

3125.119 --> 3127.92
except

3126.079 --> 3130.6400000000003
more confident

3127.92 --> 3132.48
more bravada more arrogant about it

3130.64 --> 3135.2799999999997
because they thought they absolutely

3132.48 --> 3135.28
undefeatable

3136.079 --> 3141.2000000000003
well i was just always curious to figure

3139.28 --> 3143.44
out how does this work how does this

3141.2 --> 3143.4399999999996
work

3144.559 --> 3149.0400000000004
and i believed in the ball but i

3146.72 --> 3152.0789999999997
wouldn't act

3149.04 --> 3154.4
like i didn't care about the dominance i

3152.079 --> 3156.4
didn't care that to be smarter than

3154.4 --> 3158.88
everybody right

3156.4 --> 3160.64
or to keep up and act like i'm smarter

3158.88 --> 3162.8
than everybody i didn't care for that

3160.64 --> 3165.2
attitude at all i just actually wanted

3162.8 --> 3167.52
to be smarter than everybody and do

3165.2 --> 3169.4399999999996
realize that when you are that you

3167.52 --> 3171.68
probably end up hated by everybody

3169.44 --> 3174.079
because everybody gets jealous or they

3171.68 --> 3176.0789999999997
get really frustrated or they think

3174.079 --> 3177.3590000000004
you're dangerous

3176.079 --> 3178.8390000000004
right

3177.359 --> 3182.64
so

3178.839 --> 3184.0789999999997
yeah i kind of like outballed them all

3182.64 --> 3186.5589999999997
in a way

3184.079 --> 3188.559
religiously that is they just made it

3186.559 --> 3190.3190000000004
about ego

3188.559 --> 3192.3190000000004
and just feeling like you're part of the

3190.319 --> 3195.839
winning team intellectually

3192.319 --> 3195.839
i don't care for that at all

3196.72 --> 3202.72
i actually get kind of uncomfortable

3199.2 --> 3202.72
with that social position

3203.2 --> 3208.72
i guess it you could call it

3204.8 --> 3211.44
oppositional defiance disorder

3208.72 --> 3213.2799999999997
for for yeah an association it's not

3211.44 --> 3215.359
really a disorder it's just a way of

3213.28 --> 3217.52
doing things a way of

3215.359 --> 3219.2799999999997
being

3217.52 --> 3222.319
it's not like a

3219.28 --> 3225.2000000000003
a compulsive thing that i involuntarily

3222.319 --> 3229.5589999999997
do now i actually want that

3225.2 --> 3229.5589999999997
it makes it even weirder i guess

3256.559 --> 3260.3190000000004
to prove a ball you just got to know how

3258.8 --> 3262.96
to contain gas

3260.319 --> 3265.839
without a container

3262.96 --> 3265.839
lol

3266.24 --> 3273.2799999999997
well i have my theories about that too

3270.0 --> 3276.24
there would have to be basically a

3273.28 --> 3279.559
a gravity space-time bending gravity

3276.24 --> 3279.5589999999997
side effect

3280.799 --> 3285.28
like gravity has to be

3283.28 --> 3287.92
the container or rather there has to be

3285.28 --> 3290.4
a container

3287.92 --> 3290.4
effect

3290.48 --> 3295.2
through gravity which is not the

3292.559 --> 3298.079
newtonian form by the way it's you have

3295.2 --> 3300.319
to get really artistic again

3298.079 --> 3302.96
through einstein gravity in order to

3300.319 --> 3304.079
envision how gravity could basically

3302.96 --> 3306.7200000000003
prevent

3304.079 --> 3308.4
the gas from venting off without

3306.72 --> 3310.319
completely

3308.4 --> 3312.559
deranging

3310.319 --> 3315.04
our understanding of physics right

3312.559 --> 3317.0400000000004
because like

3315.04 --> 3319.52
as boeing

3317.04 --> 3322.16
like the whole downward factor is

3319.52 --> 3324.799
completely nonsense like i don't need

3322.16 --> 3326.8799999999997
that as balwin i've even like

3324.799 --> 3329.2
kind of rolled out like now it's just

3326.88 --> 3331.6800000000003
relative density right

3329.2 --> 3334.96
because i accept that level of reality i

3331.68 --> 3337.359
don't have to go to that tiny [ __ ]

3334.96 --> 3339.68
hole where everything goes down go boom

3337.359 --> 3340.48
boom because so newtonian gravity even

3339.68 --> 3342.319
though

3340.48 --> 3344.4
you could think of it like that but it

3342.319 --> 3346.4
isn't officially right i don't go to

3344.4 --> 3350.079
that kind of level

3346.4 --> 3350.079
as ballwin i don't need to

3350.24 --> 3356.9599999999996
i have a much ra wider range of dynamics

3354.0 --> 3358.559
to work with in my imagination in order

3356.96 --> 3362.04
to keep the ball

3358.559 --> 3362.0400000000004
model cohesive

3363.76 --> 3369.6800000000003
but i don't just like to share every

3366.16 --> 3371.2799999999997
single detail about it

3369.68 --> 3374.3999999999996
i like to hold back

3371.28 --> 3375.599
on the way i envision the globe model

3374.4 --> 3378.799
universe

3375.599 --> 3380.319
because it's like too good for you

3378.799 --> 3382.16
for the world

3380.319 --> 3385.52
you don't deserve it

3382.16 --> 3385.52
huh how's that

3389.68 --> 3394.8799999999997
yeah

3391.119 --> 3399.04
first let's get rid of the demons

3394.88 --> 3399.04
and then i'll give you the full glory

3399.92 --> 3404.48
show it to you i'll i'll paint it i'll

3402.48 --> 3407.28
paint

3404.48 --> 3407.28
the details

3407.63 --> 3410.96
[Music]

3409.599 --> 3413.04
but no

3410.96 --> 3414.0
get rid of these [ __ ] demons in this

3413.04 --> 3418.72
world

3414.0 --> 3420.16
and then and then i'll go there

3418.72 --> 3422.16
before that time

3420.16 --> 3424.48
the world doesn't deserve what i have to

3422.16 --> 3424.48
offer

3424.88 --> 3429.359
so i'll give you only little snippets

3426.88 --> 3432.359
just to remind you of what needs to be

3429.359 --> 3432.359
done

3442.559 --> 3445.559
so

3457.2 --> 3463.5989999999997
you don't make fun of anything

3461.04 --> 3467.2
well you don't have that luxury akumu

3463.599 --> 3467.2000000000003
you don't i mean you're very

3469.68 --> 3474.64
light-hearted about the situation but

3472.4 --> 3476.88
you don't really have any grip to make

3474.64 --> 3480.24
fun of it right to make fun of something

3476.88 --> 3482.96
you actually have to have grip on it

3480.24 --> 3484.799
now ballers are anti-flat earthers that

3482.96 --> 3486.559
do try to make fun of flat earthers

3484.799 --> 3490.0
guess what

3486.559 --> 3492.1600000000003
they're not making fun of model details

3490.0 --> 3493.599
i mean they sometimes straw men and then

3492.16 --> 3495.359
make fun of that

3493.599 --> 3498.319
but that doesn't really work so they end

3495.359 --> 3500.5589999999997
up trying to get a grip on the flat

3498.319 --> 3503.04
earthers feelings in their social life

3500.559 --> 3505.52
and like yeah this strain that a flat

3503.04 --> 3507.68
earther will compare to a glober have to

3505.52 --> 3510.799
go through in their life

3507.68 --> 3512.48
in order to do what they do

3510.799 --> 3516.559
and then they push on that because

3512.48 --> 3517.76
that's the only thing they have grip on

3516.559 --> 3520.1600000000003
right

3517.76 --> 3522.7200000000003
not on actual mechanical arguments

3520.16 --> 3525.52
because in that

3522.72 --> 3528.799
in that area

3525.52 --> 3532.96
the flat earth debaters just have

3528.799 --> 3532.96
pretty much 99 win

3534.72 --> 3541.8799999999997
and 1

3536.16 --> 3541.8799999999997
is not enough ever to get an actual win

3545.119 --> 3550.7200000000003
i mean i'm trying as ballwin right

3547.2 --> 3550.72
there's still some maneuvering room

3552.0 --> 3556.88
but yeah

3553.76 --> 3560.3190000000004
that's only because of what i am because

3556.88 --> 3563.359
i am a dual cosmogenist because i can

3560.319 --> 3564.4
believe in the ball religion

3563.359 --> 3567.68
and

3564.4 --> 3570.0
still no flat earth at the same time

3567.68 --> 3571.359
or rather separately i can't literally

3570.0 --> 3574.24
have it at the same time that will

3571.359 --> 3576.96
conflict but i can basically choose like

3574.24 --> 3579.359
now i'm going left to the left i'm going

3576.96 --> 3581.68
to be a baller now and then i am a

3579.359 --> 3584.0
baller

3581.68 --> 3586.72
on top of it it's like a mask i put on

3584.0 --> 3590.16
but that mask becomes me but i can then

3586.72 --> 3592.0789999999997
just choose to to put it off

3590.16 --> 3594.72
and then i have another

3592.079 --> 3594.7200000000003
aspect

3596.799 --> 3600.799
that i can focus

3599.839 --> 3603.68
right

3600.799 --> 3606.16
because flat earth to me is not a belief

3603.68 --> 3607.9199999999996
it's a discovery journey it's trying to

3606.16 --> 3609.7599999999998
figure things out how they really are

3607.92 --> 3612.319
and it's very conflicting because the

3609.76 --> 3614.48
majority of people in the world don't

3612.319 --> 3616.0
want to know things they don't want to

3614.48 --> 3618.16
know heavy

3616.0 --> 3620.88
big implication type things they don't

3618.16 --> 3620.8799999999997
want to know it

3621.52 --> 3625.839
if it's real they'd love to fantasize

3623.92 --> 3628.0
about such things in movies when they

3625.839 --> 3630.96
know it's fiction but they don't really

3628.0 --> 3635.44
want to be confronted with really

3630.96 --> 3635.44
big things that narrow their imagination

3637.44 --> 3641.92
right so as a flat earther i don't have

3639.599 --> 3645.839
a belief i just kind of have a mission

3641.92 --> 3647.599
but as a baller i do have a belief

3645.839 --> 3651.599
and i do

3647.599 --> 3653.599
i do even as baller ball win i know

3651.599 --> 3654.559
technically that i could never really

3653.599 --> 3656.48
win

3654.559 --> 3657.92
but the only real win

3656.48 --> 3660.72
would be

3657.92 --> 3662.64
to reform the ball religion and

3660.72 --> 3664.799
basically

3662.64 --> 3667.44
get the demons out of it

3664.799 --> 3669.04
although is that impossible at this

3667.44 --> 3670.559
stage

3669.04 --> 3672.319
so much

3670.559 --> 3674.7200000000003
yeah like

3672.319 --> 3676.88
maybe the entire infrastructure of what

3674.72 --> 3681.9199999999996
it really is is actually demonic in

3676.88 --> 3681.92
nature i don't know for sure i hope not

3682.0 --> 3687.04
can it be redeemed can it be an archaic

3684.64 --> 3689.359
mind tool that can stand the test of

3687.04 --> 3689.359
time

3689.92 --> 3694.64
a game that we can play with our own

3692.4 --> 3697.2000000000003
suspense of disbelief and to learn from

3694.64 --> 3699.1189999999997
it and to learn from the psychology

3697.2 --> 3701.1189999999997
right because we are learning a lot from

3699.119 --> 3703.04
psychology at least

3701.119 --> 3706.559
and a lot of people are refining their

3703.04 --> 3709.04
math and geometry skills a lot

3706.559 --> 3709.76
so even just by being preoccupied with

3709.04 --> 3713.599
it

3709.76 --> 3715.92
serves an educational function

3713.599 --> 3719.6400000000003
in different regions right do do a

3715.92 --> 3719.64
cosmetic society

3742.96 --> 3747.28
how do you go back to the heliocentric

3745.039 --> 3747.28
lie

3748.16 --> 3752.0
once you know the truth and the proof is

3750.4 --> 3752.88
undeniable

3752.0 --> 3755.839
uh

3752.88 --> 3758.319
you forget about it guns of nephron

3755.839 --> 3761.7599999999998
maybe you can't imagine that

3758.319 --> 3764.24
but what if you out of look

3761.76 --> 3767.039
i've already explained many times on my

3764.24 --> 3769.0389999999998
shows that i've been awoken

3767.039 --> 3771.8390000000004
to the flat earth

3769.039 --> 3773.92
like many times even throughout my very

3771.839 --> 3776.4
young years

3773.92 --> 3777.599
but what i would do is just like hear

3776.4 --> 3780.1600000000003
him out

3777.599 --> 3781.52
see it as like a story

3780.16 --> 3782.72
even though it's supposed to be about

3781.52 --> 3785.599
the truth

3782.72 --> 3788.0
figure out the mechanics to get a feel

3785.599 --> 3788.799
mechanically about it

3788.0 --> 3791.52
but

3788.799 --> 3794.88
never let the implications of it being

3791.52 --> 3797.2
true sink through you see

3794.88 --> 3798.559
so just understand the mechanics of

3797.2 --> 3801.0389999999998
reality

3798.559 --> 3801.039
about it

3801.28 --> 3806.96
but never letting it destroy

3804.64 --> 3811.2799999999997
my belief in the globe

3806.96 --> 3813.28
so i would just forget about it

3811.28 --> 3815.52
at first it would be like a mechanical

3813.28 --> 3817.039
memory of like the arguments and then

3815.52 --> 3818.96
after a while it kind of fades away and

3817.039 --> 3820.7990000000004
then i literally forget

3818.96 --> 3822.88
that i've ever heard it

3820.799 --> 3824.88
and that's happened like five or six

3822.88 --> 3826.799
times throughout my life

3824.88 --> 3828.559
somebody would completely lay it out i

3826.799 --> 3829.44
would literally in the moment be like

3828.559 --> 3831.52
damn

3829.44 --> 3834.16
you're right it is flat that makes

3831.52 --> 3837.7599999999998
perfect sense and then the next day i

3834.16 --> 3840.319
would have literally forgotten it

3837.76 --> 3842.079
i would literally face the person they

3840.319 --> 3845.52
would ask a question about it and i'm

3842.079 --> 3845.52
like what what are you talking about

3845.68 --> 3849.839
and they'd be kind of freaked out like

3848.079 --> 3851.2000000000003
what's going on here we had this

3849.839 --> 3854.5589999999997
conversation

3851.2 --> 3854.5589999999997
and i'm like i don't remember

3854.64 --> 3858.5589999999997
and they'd be weirded out and that's

3856.799 --> 3861.44
happened to me

3858.559 --> 3863.599
quite a few times in my past

3861.44 --> 3864.839
it's like amnesia

3863.599 --> 3867.28
it's what the

3864.839 --> 3869.119
ballers function or the anti-flight

3867.28 --> 3871.3590000000004
earth is they have that mechanism too

3869.119 --> 3873.6800000000003
but they abuse it

3871.359 --> 3875.0389999999998
constantly so they must be

3873.68 --> 3877.2
mentally

3875.039 --> 3880.0
degrading because they are apparently

3877.2 --> 3881.7599999999998
constantly having amnesia about

3880.0 --> 3884.0
everything and they and they kind of

3881.76 --> 3886.96
know it intuitively and they enforce

3884.0 --> 3888.72
their own amnesia i never did that

3886.96 --> 3890.16
because i wouldn't just the next day

3888.72 --> 3893.2799999999997
immediately like oh tell me about

3890.16 --> 3895.92
flutter so i can break it again no i'd

3893.28 --> 3898.7200000000003
literally forget everything about it

3895.92 --> 3900.96
and just start doing other things

3898.72 --> 3903.68
and then at a later point it'd be so

3900.96 --> 3905.359
forgotten i'd be like what is this

3903.68 --> 3906.3999999999996
all over again

3905.359 --> 3910.5589999999997
like

3906.4 --> 3911.44
a mouse being drawn to the cheese

3910.559 --> 3913.599
right

3911.44 --> 3915.28
like hey what is this

3913.599 --> 3918.079
all over again

3915.28 --> 3921.559
several times people several times this

3918.079 --> 3921.559
happened to me

3942.24 --> 3946.5589999999997
geez poor arwin memory what

3946.799 --> 3951.68
no it's not poor

3949.119 --> 3954.48
it's on purpose by arranged by the

3951.68 --> 3954.48
subconscious

3957.44 --> 3961.76
it's very simple

3959.2 --> 3963.4399999999996
from the inside i was judged i cannot

3961.76 --> 3966.6400000000003
actually handle this

3963.44 --> 3969.2000000000003
but i'm very curious and i do eventually

3966.64 --> 3972.0789999999997
want to understand but never then from

3969.2 --> 3976.0789999999997
that position

3972.079 --> 3976.079
realizing that it changes everything

3976.319 --> 3981.359
having a feel for it but never letting

3978.559 --> 3981.3590000000004
that sink through

3983.44 --> 3989.52
i just it's like no i'm not ready to

3985.839 --> 3990.96
grow up that's basically what it is

3989.52 --> 3992.88
that's the feeling

3990.96 --> 3995.839
that's what drives it it's like no i'm

3992.88 --> 3999.359
not ready to snap out of this dream yet

3995.839 --> 4002.0789999999997
i need it i need it and the society has

3999.359 --> 4004.319
a lot of it and i still need to feel

4002.079 --> 4008.7200000000003
part of that society

4004.319 --> 4008.72
to get around for my dreams

4015.28 --> 4018.52
what's this

4022.48 --> 4027.4
that's not necessary matthew hall

4039.359 --> 4044.2
nobody's fighting over you lydia logs

4053.44 --> 4055.839
right

4059.28 --> 4064.0
yeah guns have nephron it does happen

4061.68 --> 4065.7599999999998
but it does have it's it's not common

4064.0 --> 4067.599
though

4065.76 --> 4071.039
right because

4067.599 --> 4073.839
to do that to actually

4071.039 --> 4077.119
agree to lie

4073.839 --> 4079.599
specifically for money or like societal

4077.119 --> 4082.0
advantages that's exactly like satanic

4079.599 --> 4084.319
corruption that the elites used to get

4082.0 --> 4084.319
power

4084.64 --> 4088.4
it's

4086.0 --> 4091.2
it's through the choice and it's very

4088.4 --> 4093.2000000000003
it's it's treacherous because there's a

4091.2 --> 4095.52
spiritual aspect to it you know the

4093.2 --> 4098.3189999999995
truth versus lies

4095.52 --> 4101.04
god versus the devil

4098.319 --> 4102.4800000000005
well if you then take money or perks

4101.04 --> 4104.56
to lie

4102.48 --> 4106.799
that's pretty straight out

4104.56 --> 4110.88
a bad situation that you get yourself

4106.799 --> 4110.88

4130.96 --> 4134.719
bit annoying but you could just try to

4133.04 --> 4137.199
ignore him and if he starts spamming

4134.719 --> 4140.319
