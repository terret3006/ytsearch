4.43 --> 12.45
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

8.49 --> 17.34
early-bird number 96 I'm your host

12.45 --> 18.299999999999997
Arwen and today sunny sunny day it's

17.34 --> 22.109
been all day

18.3 --> 24.65
oh yeah chemtrails are all over the

22.109 --> 31.46
place but doesn't seem to really matter

24.65 --> 31.459999999999997
because it is really really sunny so

31.61 --> 40.85
that's good it's nice like it so what

38.309 --> 49.14
you gonna do about it

40.85 --> 57.53
and though I'm live it seems very oddly

49.14 --> 60.17
like no one is here no activity in chat

57.53 --> 68.31
none whatsoever

60.17 --> 71.96000000000001
and YouTube is acting weird don't

68.31 --> 71.96000000000001
understand what it's doing

74.719 --> 83.74
maybe just everybody's gone although see

80.96 --> 94.63999999999999
for watching

83.74 --> 99.79899999999999
hey a person JJ yeah I'm starting early

94.64 --> 104.299
because I got sick of waiting so how are

99.799 --> 107.59
you doing see some Sun and chemtrails

104.299 --> 107.59
it's really nice

113.58 --> 119.39
it's Sun and lots of chemtrails goody

127.0 --> 134.26
whatever that is given trails trails

131.64 --> 137.89
artificial clouds I don't know what they

134.26 --> 142.0
are I know that everything's been said

137.89 --> 143.92
about them you can imagine and what if

142.0 --> 149.83
it is true and what of it is just a

143.92 --> 153.13
bluff even in control

149.83 --> 156.28
is anybody in control are they

153.13 --> 159.69
suggesting they are in control are they

156.28 --> 159.69
or is it just a bluff

168.959 --> 171.65
so

172.81 --> 179.19
oh wait I forgot my tea let me get it

176.77 --> 179.19
for a moment

247.92 --> 263.24
ooh ooh 10 watching and still I can only

258.06 --> 265.35
see JJ and Jeff this is quite unusual

263.24 --> 269.13
hey to a twin

265.35 --> 270.47
oh is it Valentine's Day oh that makes

269.13 --> 273.51
sense

270.47 --> 276.69000000000005
makes a lot of sense means people are

273.51 --> 280.73
not here because they may actually have

276.69 --> 280.73
lives some time

287.86 --> 295.06
anyway I am open to a another person or

292.52 --> 295.06
a troll

298.07 --> 307.39
No maybe actual person Wesley stays and

301.94 --> 307.39
flutters news talks do the morning

314.98 --> 318.88
turn off cats eyes

322.17 --> 332.25
typical I'm very hungry

326.25 --> 332.25
but getting anything except tea

342.51 --> 346.21999999999997
so what's going on out there

348.22 --> 356.56
I barely remember anything from last

352.09 --> 362.78999999999996
evening because I went overboard on the

356.56 --> 362.79
red wine again it's weird

376.1 --> 385.87
see there were a lot of hangouts as

379.7 --> 389.09
usual I think I ended up watching

385.87 --> 392.57
multiple streams at the same time it's

389.09 --> 395.67999999999995
very typical I used to do that a long

392.57 --> 395.68
time ago as well

397.29 --> 405.55
playing video games listening music and

402.69 --> 410.05
watching the Alex Jones Show at the same

405.55 --> 412.889
time I used to do that a lot o ultra

410.05 --> 412.889
multitasking

418.57 --> 425.53
punch of Pete's tensho pizzas as a new

423.74 --> 428.53000000000003
channel oh goody

425.53 --> 428.53
so

430.55 --> 433.39
what is it about

440.419 --> 445.03
just same old same old how's he doing

467.639 --> 474.169
means snacks it's not in the future you

471.96 --> 474.169
mean

481.41 --> 488.96000000000004
anyway yeah if any of you are open to

485.25 --> 491.96
join that will be interesting

488.96 --> 491.96
Gus

492.47 --> 495.07000000000005
yeah

497.27 --> 504.5
don't feel I have anything sensible to

499.61 --> 510.94
talk about really so much going on and

504.5 --> 510.94
all the synchronicities all these

512.29 --> 517.23
all these things going on that just

514.45 --> 522.5500000000001
seems like everything is being halted

517.23 --> 525.15
dead in its tracks every front and it is

522.55 --> 525.15
quite

527.26 --> 532.89
I don't even know if it could call it

529.0 --> 532.89
frustrating it just seems pointless

534.15 --> 541.98
every news thing I see seems completely

539.14 --> 541.98
pointless

545.55 --> 550.1999999999999
realizing more and more that no matter

547.86 --> 553.23
where you get some kind of news from

550.2 --> 556.85
some kind of narrative from it's always

553.23 --> 560.76
incomplete it's always incomplete

556.85 --> 564.39
because it has to be otherwise it would

560.76 --> 566.779
be pointless to put it out so super

564.39 --> 566.779
ironic

577.01 --> 586.12
I guess with pessimistic I've been

580.87 --> 588.839
feelings of pessimism in that sense but

586.12 --> 588.839
doesn't

588.87 --> 593.47
doesn't mean anything really so I'm just

591.63 --> 597.73
gonna

593.47 --> 599.86
see I can do right here yeah one of

597.73 --> 602.77
these things I realized and kind of

599.86 --> 607.09
disappointed disappointed maybe myself

602.77 --> 612.1
but also even my audience that is yeah I

607.09 --> 616.4200000000001
had this this intro remember months ago

612.1 --> 620.62
I think even before 2019 an intro to my

616.42 --> 624.54
show that I still don't have a title for

620.62 --> 627.55
and I don't have the intro so goodie

624.54 --> 629.92
it's more that I don't have it's just me

627.55 --> 632.3499999999999
Arwen talking in the same damn room over

629.92 --> 634.74
and over again with the same shitty mic

632.35 --> 634.74
sound

640.58 --> 648.0200000000001
going anywhere I don't know is it going

643.61 --> 651.0500000000001
anywhere it is that a lot of good people

648.02 --> 657.49
and a lot of good stories from other

651.05 --> 657.49
people I do really appreciate that but

667.66 --> 675.63
just feels like the entire balance it's

671.589 --> 675.6300000000001
very far-fetched

676.46 --> 682.9000000000001
I know maybe some of you get this

678.23 --> 685.79
sensation too sometimes it doesn't

682.9 --> 690.8299999999999
really matter what you choose where you

685.79 --> 696.4699999999999
go it's always it's never gonna find

690.83 --> 699.22
rest it's never gonna be enough and it's

696.47 --> 701.8100000000001
never going anywhere

699.22 --> 706.9100000000001
now that's certainly a message is not

701.81 --> 713.0
gonna make a lot of people happy yes it

706.91 --> 716.23
is honesty so it feels and feels like

713.0 --> 716.23
the entire world

717.51 --> 723.62
designed just to make things implant

743.72 --> 746.9200000000001
but right

747.01 --> 755.079
what's the use of even thinking about

749.68 --> 757.18
that when you could just go with it

755.079 --> 760.8389999999999
no matter where it goes no matter how

757.18 --> 764.279
insane it is doesn't even seem it just

760.839 --> 768.61
is it doesn't really matter you just go

764.279 --> 771.399
you help out to destroy the world and

768.61 --> 777.24
you give a little bit of consolation

771.399 --> 777.24
prize in the process delicious delicious

784.079 --> 790.189
yeah even if you wouldn't you will

789.089 --> 792.5690000000001
anyway

790.189 --> 795.54
doesn't really matter what you do or you

792.569 --> 801.139
don't you're going to contribute to it

795.54 --> 801.139
all funny isn't it

803.81 --> 813.17
anyway I am guessing I am pushing your

808.71 --> 813.1700000000001
people now just pushing you

817.06 --> 821.31
must be human nature

823.24 --> 828.19
must be the other side or they blame

826.15 --> 831.52
everybody else off because that's always

828.19 --> 834.58
funny how it works we were all trolls

831.52 --> 838.24
even if we don't know it we always blame

834.58 --> 840.64
the others the outside for everything

838.24 --> 841.26
that we think is wrong and then Oh guess

840.64 --> 846.49
what

841.26 --> 848.95
really quickly your if you don't have

846.49 --> 851.98
all these obstacles installed to prevent

848.95 --> 854.2900000000001
you from learning what is real really

851.98 --> 857.02
quickly you find out that all of the

854.29 --> 859.54
accusations is exactly what you are

857.02 --> 862.09
doing funny isn't it

859.54 --> 865.3199999999999
you can only accuse others of what you

862.09 --> 869.22
are doing wrong it's brilliant

865.32 --> 869.22
it's brilliant system

885.98 --> 893.6800000000001
and yes JD impatience absolutely

890.66 --> 893.68
impatience I'm

898.07 --> 904.75
I am super impatient with the entire

902.33 --> 904.75
thing

908.629 --> 914.249
getting sensations of restlessness just

912.42 --> 922.04
wanting to throw everything overboard

914.249 --> 926.339
just RAM in some new angle that I hate

922.04 --> 929.399
that I just find something that I've

926.339 --> 933.0500000000001
tried not to do all my life and just do

929.399 --> 939.689
it full strength full force completely

933.05 --> 942.649
ramming through that but is it gonna be

939.689 --> 942.649
any different

959.76 --> 966.58
and again yeah look I have been building

963.19 --> 969.22
up a super modest show here just the guy

966.58 --> 973.3000000000001
talking and I got an audience and yeah

969.22 --> 975.22
if I did that I'd be giving up again I'd

973.3 --> 981.0699999999999
be throwing something away again so

975.22 --> 983.35
maybe I should just take and I'm yeah I

981.07 --> 985.3900000000001
am being a little bit are witty and

983.35 --> 989.35
dramatic here maybe I should just take

985.39 --> 990.34
this suffering and raffle in it just

989.35 --> 993.1
enjoy it

990.34 --> 997.5400000000001
and keep on doing what I'm doing until

993.1 --> 999.94
it kills me and that's the whole plan

997.54 --> 1005.8199999999999
that's always been the plan maybe is

999.94 --> 1012.4200000000001
just choose something give it everything

1005.82 --> 1012.9300000000001
and then die I am such a positive mood

1012.42 --> 1016.5899999999999
today

1012.93 --> 1021.5999999999999
this is this is no I'm not despite all

1016.59 --> 1023.97
that Sun out there there's chemtrails

1021.6 --> 1028.47
filtering out all the all the good vibes

1023.97 --> 1033.18
I don't know what it is but yeah I guess

1028.47 --> 1038.839
I could blame my dreams maybe maybe give

1033.18 --> 1043.3700000000001
something else you know it's not me

1038.839 --> 1045.799
not me my fault was my dreams my dreams

1043.37 --> 1052.2489999999998
are the thing that are making me feel

1045.799 --> 1057.71
terrible and doing all this you know

1052.249 --> 1062.539
it's not amalgamation of everything what

1057.71 --> 1064.549
I do what the world does how I respond

1062.539 --> 1067.039
to it how I make choices how the world

1064.549 --> 1069.649
make choice it's not that must be

1067.039 --> 1073.639
something isolated just a dream

1069.649 --> 1078.1999999999998
no yeah we don't really understand dream

1073.639 --> 1080.24
so this is the easy target can just

1078.2 --> 1083.779
blame that and yeah it's something

1080.24 --> 1085.879
mystical more the mystical thing is mr.

1083.779 --> 1089.45
Blaine yeah

1085.879 --> 1093.769
it's the dream it's not me it's not the

1089.45 --> 1095.799
world's the dream that's to blame you

1093.769 --> 1095.799
know

1097.01 --> 1105.35
that way I can at least uphold some

1099.99 --> 1105.35
level of illusion that things are okay

1135.529 --> 1143.37
periodic right

1138.72 --> 1152.49
it is but it's just the way this thing

1143.37 --> 1157.6499999999999
started up is just unusual so odd you

1152.49 --> 1164.22
can just look at every simple detail and

1157.65 --> 1168.6000000000001
seems so the same yet everything seems

1164.22 --> 1171.74
to be turned in an opposite direction it

1168.6 --> 1171.74
just feels so weird

1186.029 --> 1192.13
for Orlovsky I'm

1188.66 --> 1192.13
39 years old

1226.18 --> 1236.1100000000001
so yeah I put out the link in chat

1230.43 --> 1241.5700000000002
almost an hour ago so is anybody gonna

1236.11 --> 1246.79
join distract me from this weird spiral

1241.57 --> 1252.49
thing and I don't know maybe we can

1246.79 --> 1257.2
actually talk about a subject that can

1252.49 --> 1260.86
help us distract from what's out there

1257.2 --> 1262.8700000000001
and just puzzle on something in the

1260.86 --> 1266.1399999999999
moment because it's really nice

1262.87 --> 1268.29
distraction it's what I like the most

1266.14 --> 1276.3000000000002
about the whole Flat Earth debates it's

1268.29 --> 1281.43
it's such an enveloping distraction and

1276.3 --> 1281.43
maybe maybe that is why we even do it

1290.75 --> 1293.35
yeah

1299.13 --> 1308.73
hey all right IRA killed the hope yeah

1305.34 --> 1313.32
yeah I did yeah I did that was your wife

1308.73 --> 1316.8600000000001
and talk to cool cool to see ya how are

1313.32 --> 1322.11
you doing it's the first time you spoke

1316.86 --> 1324.9799999999998
out in my chat now that does make me

1322.11 --> 1324.9799999999998
feel good for a moment

1328.33 --> 1331.1999999999998
thank you

1339.73 --> 1342.45
hmm

1356.56 --> 1359.6399999999999
so yeah

1371.35 --> 1377.6499999999999
our set curve right where is it

1406.26 --> 1414.679
yep that's okay it's sunny should be

1411.69 --> 1414.679
happy should probably

1415.46 --> 1418.75
we're doing something

1432.45 --> 1438.799
yeah

1435.21 --> 1438.799
still very kempt really

1444.5 --> 1451.88
I've been thinking maybe we should just

1447.31 --> 1454.97
soon say it's all just not now in the

1451.88 --> 1460.15
future in the future I should do

1454.97 --> 1464.42
something yeah but maybe just screw the

1460.15 --> 1467.72
intro animation and just do the intro

1464.42 --> 1471.41
video with music Chris Barry made things

1467.72 --> 1473.9
pretty cool just do that and screw the

1471.41 --> 1479.3000000000002
title card because at least I got that

1473.9 --> 1481.73
and nobody else seems to care so I'm

1479.3 --> 1489.08
just gonna do that and it's gonna be

1481.73 --> 1492.89
sloppy it's gonna be what it is because

1489.08 --> 1496.01
apparently that is how things happen

1492.89 --> 1501.38
with our win always half measures

1496.01 --> 1504.83
half measures all the way so if I am

1501.38 --> 1508.46
gonna actually continue something that

1504.83 --> 1512.27
I've built up then at least I can do it

1508.46 --> 1516.5900000000001
half-assed that way I can do something

1512.27 --> 1520.66
and complete it without actually

1516.59 --> 1520.6599999999999
completing it that would probably

1521.32 --> 1528.4399999999998
complete the circle that way I can

1525.83 --> 1531.53
finish something without finishing it

1528.44 --> 1535.18
that would be properly it would be

1531.53 --> 1535.18
proper for me I think

1547.309 --> 1555.98
really Nick it's a troll flip-flopping

1552.63 --> 1555.98
time are you sure

1568.549 --> 1575.839
I don't believe it for a second I

1572.44 --> 1582.739
believe that the trolls that were on the

1575.839 --> 1586.099
globe side may have may have lost it in

1582.739 --> 1587.989
a sense as in that they have given up

1586.099 --> 1590.869
caring about it and are just gonna

1587.989 --> 1593.3890000000001
flip-flop and try to drive everyone

1590.869 --> 1598.339
insane luring people into some kind of

1593.389 --> 1600.6789999999999
trust and then breaking that it's like a

1598.339 --> 1604.549
next step in psychological warfare

1600.679 --> 1607.249
Jose showed the way in a very nice way

1604.549 --> 1610.219
and now the trolls can follow and do it

1607.249 --> 1614.869
exactly the same but much more brutal

1610.219 --> 1616.909
and harsh and just screw with us all and

1614.869 --> 1621.049
you say oh look we're the flat-earthers

1616.909 --> 1623.659
and we really curved and we want war and

1621.049 --> 1626.119
we're gonna kill everyone who so you're

1623.659 --> 1628.999
gonna turn into the enemy to try and

1626.119 --> 1632.349
destroy us and confuse everyone and

1628.999 --> 1632.349
that's just great

1636.299 --> 1639.54
thanks Nick

1643.79 --> 1651.6499999999999
anyway yeah I got another new Georgie

1648.2 --> 1656.8300000000002
cool because it's so valuable so

1651.65 --> 1656.8300000000002
important that

1656.85 --> 1661.07
that was another was it

1662.88 --> 1666.96
why did I even see that

1667.35 --> 1675.77
was another Mars related thing but now I

1671.79 --> 1681.35
gotta find it back that's not so easy

1675.77 --> 1684.72
because there is so much news stuff and

1681.35 --> 1686.58
news if you can even call it news

1684.72 --> 1689.73
anymore these days all right it wasn't

1686.58 --> 1692.58
info worst thingy yeah NASA's Mars rover

1689.73 --> 1699.06
declared dead they'd given up because

1692.58 --> 1702.6599999999999
there was a dust storm on Mars and no so

1699.06 --> 1706.62
they're giving up Mars right while

1702.66 --> 1713.13
giving up mesa de Ulua more finances

1706.62 --> 1717.4199999999998
lost more loss less outlook so yeah but

1713.13 --> 1721.0500000000002
you know we gather enough money extract

1717.42 --> 1724.47
it from people's dreams more than we

1721.05 --> 1728.37
could eventually do something again in

1724.47 --> 1734.84
the future there's always chance huge

1728.37 --> 1734.84
chance so doesn't really mean anything

1739.55 --> 1742.6299999999999
seems like

1743.0 --> 1749.299
who's ever whoever is rolling these

1745.909 --> 1754.1200000000001
things out determining what is gonna hit

1749.299 --> 1758.98
the news is just fooling around and

1754.12 --> 1758.9799999999998
could just switch it around you know

1759.01 --> 1764.44
could be saying one thing one day and

1761.63 --> 1767.6000000000001
the exact opposite the other day and I

1764.44 --> 1770.1200000000001
don't know maybe at the point where

1767.6 --> 1772.039
they're gonna do it nobody even cares

1770.12 --> 1774.8799999999999
anymore or even listens anymore it just

1772.039 --> 1774.8799999999999
doesn't matter

1788.44 --> 1792.72
global Internet shutdown

1796.28 --> 1803.02
course global internet shutdown it's

1799.7 --> 1803.02
makes perfect sense

1808.92 --> 1814.89
because now where everything is crazy

1811.46 --> 1816.72
things don't make any sense people have

1814.89 --> 1819.5700000000002
all the freedom in the world to do

1816.72 --> 1822.29
something but everything gets so jumbled

1819.57 --> 1824.34
and messed up and distracted that

1822.29 --> 1826.2
doesn't really matter what you do it

1824.34 --> 1831.27
it's all senseless so they're just gonna

1826.2 --> 1837.6000000000001
shut it down all of it so at least you

1831.27 --> 1839.49
can miss it so much and hurts by that it

1837.6 --> 1841.02
was there that you had an opportunity

1839.49 --> 1844.29
that it got screwed up and it's got

1841.02 --> 1848.8799999999999
taken away it's the perfect mental

1844.29 --> 1851.04
torture give give you something make you

1848.88 --> 1854.13
love it potentially make you dependent

1851.04 --> 1859.08
on it and then shove it under you it's

1854.13 --> 1861.5100000000002
like yeah that's gone now suffer suffer

1859.08 --> 1865.55
for what you had and you don't have it

1861.51 --> 1865.55
anymore lovely lovely

1869.99 --> 1874.9
who knows

1873.01 --> 1879.309
you know with all these things all these

1874.9 --> 1881.2
suggestions is it all gonna end

1879.309 --> 1882.84
it's everything just gonna end there it

1881.2 --> 1888.48
would look they're destroying all that

1882.84 --> 1892.0
is it just all all Bluff all of it and

1888.48 --> 1895.21
nothing ever happens I think sometimes

1892.0 --> 1897.25
like it's all of love everything nothing

1895.21 --> 1899.1100000000001
really ever happens or if it's gonna

1897.25 --> 1899.77
happen nobody's ever gonna tell you

1899.11 --> 1903.9099999999999
about it

1899.77 --> 1906.22
it's just gonna happen because maybe

1903.91 --> 1910.929
things that are talked about are all the

1906.22 --> 1913.3600000000001
things that are not gonna happen and you

1910.929 --> 1914.94
won't find out what is gonna happen

1913.36 --> 1920.53
until it happens

1914.94 --> 1922.67
makes strategical financial sense you

1920.53 --> 1926.78
know

1922.67 --> 1929.27
make everyone lost and keep the actual

1926.78 --> 1933.26
foresight completely to yourself so you

1929.27 --> 1936.98
can end up on top you know why would

1933.26 --> 1941.2
they in any kind of truth what is going

1936.98 --> 1941.2
on any of it to anyone

1949.97 --> 1954.1290000000001
I am in such a shitty mood today

1967.26 --> 1974.34
but it's part of this cycle what okay

1972.24 --> 1979.43
I'm getting a notification now that

1974.34 --> 1983.6999999999998
apparently I've just gone life hmm

YouTube thank you for notifying that I

1995.4 --> 2000.41
just went live

1997.19 --> 2007.27
even though I just went live 33 minutes

2000.41 --> 2010.72
ago whew 33 minutes yeah so meant to be

2007.27 --> 2013.72
so to mantra it's all synchronicities oh

2010.72 --> 2013.72
oh

2017.19 --> 2020.19
right

2020.7 --> 2027.46
only Schiphol can't see says he is in

2023.769 --> 2039.3990000000001
the Hangout well I don't see you there

2027.46 --> 2042.19
oh wait now I do okay right are you

2039.399 --> 2049.7799999999997
gonna join my show everyday to try to

2042.19 --> 2052.359
rescue me from my own insanity I can't

2049.78 --> 2056.349
hear you by the way I got my volume up

2052.359 --> 2060.879
fully but I can't hear you so and you're

2056.349 --> 2065.579
not even now yes I can I had to get back

2060.879 --> 2065.5789999999997
to the screen of that hangout to Linda

2065.849 --> 2076.7200000000003
cool I'll come back

2070.48 --> 2080.32
I'm not you know I think good you do

2076.72 --> 2084.1589999999997
that what I don't feel I'm doing any

2080.32 --> 2086.9700000000003
good or I feel like it's such a crazy

2084.159 --> 2091.3
sensation it feels like I have to do

2086.97 --> 2096.0699999999997
[ __ ] in order for things out there to go

2091.3 --> 2105.099
good it is the most bizarre ironic

2096.07 --> 2110.8590000000004
sensation I can think of like maybe if I

2105.099 --> 2113.23
am pessimistic and just dark in a non

2110.859 --> 2117.25
demonic but just super pessimist way

2113.23 --> 2119.92
then maybe in an ironic response the

2117.25 --> 2124.119
world will actually finally start to

2119.92 --> 2126.16
make sense again because I don't does

2124.119 --> 2131.079
that make any sense thing probably

2126.16 --> 2133.66
doesn't I think I think you need to

2131.079 --> 2136.03
trust just a moment I think right as the

2133.66 --> 2137.7999999999997
moment you're beginning to know and have

2136.03 --> 2140.8590000000004
traction and have control in your own

2137.8 --> 2142.869
mind and you know feel good again about

2140.859 --> 2144.819
yourself so something comes along to go

2142.869 --> 2147.19
you should be sure and rather than

2144.819 --> 2149.41
listening to yourself you know you're

2147.19 --> 2149.89
leaning towards the others and I don't

2149.41 --> 2156.97
agree

2149.89 --> 2161.92
I mean towards the green meaning meaning

2156.97 --> 2164.3489999999997
other than yourself you know I mean the

2161.92 --> 2164.89
information that you give comes from

2164.349 --> 2167.38
your heart

2164.89 --> 2171.5789999999997
and that can't be taught you have to

2167.38 --> 2177.4500000000003
have the heart and so right you know

2171.579 --> 2180.6600000000003
it's not it's not a way it's your way

2177.45 --> 2180.66
that is

2181.02 --> 2188.11
you know and so you think this is all

2184.51 --> 2190.0
just part of of the cycle it's supposed

2188.11 --> 2192.94
to be there I think supposed to be

2190.0 --> 2196.6
expressed I'm supposed to be pessimistic

2192.94 --> 2198.67
to show the back parts I don't want to

2196.6 --> 2202.27
show it I think it's so disgusting and

2198.67 --> 2204.64
ugly you know I think it's really

2202.27 --> 2210.88
disgusting the way that I feel and think

2204.64 --> 2213.64
right now you know but that doesn't mean

2210.88 --> 2216.3
an entire you know throwing it all away

2213.64 --> 2219.91
and throw a little loud I mean it's just

2216.3 --> 2223.3900000000003
explained I think it doesn't make any

2219.91 --> 2226.81
sense to do it but it's almost like that

2223.39 --> 2230.2599999999998
even if I don't I will do it anyway just

2226.81 --> 2232.95
in another way it's like that system

2230.26 --> 2236.11
that systematic response is just

2232.95 --> 2239.7999999999997
following me around wherever I go so

2236.11 --> 2243.81
even if I don't give up I'll still give

2239.8 --> 2246.88
up because I can't not do it

2243.81 --> 2251.67
even though I may convince myself that I

2246.88 --> 2254.11
can see I guess it's the demons just

2251.67 --> 2258.73
following me around and getting very

2254.11 --> 2262.09
very very close to my mind maybe that is

2258.73 --> 2267.1
it well remember what it says in

2262.09 --> 2269.08
Ephesians you know it talks about you

2267.1 --> 2272.74
know you put on your armor of God so

2269.08 --> 2278.49
that you can you can stop with the fiery

2272.74 --> 2281.74
arrows of the demons all right and so

2278.49 --> 2283.72
these thought forms that make you doubt

2281.74 --> 2286.45
what did I tell the other they the doubt

2283.72 --> 2289.99
is not the divine the doubt doesn't

2286.45 --> 2291.8199999999997
enable faith to manifest doubt down

2289.99 --> 2296.4399999999996
exactly your trust I don't know to what

2291.82 --> 2300.01
process doubt to what even yourself do

2296.44 --> 2302.34
what do i what is it about myself that I

2300.01 --> 2302.34
doubt

2302.94 --> 2310.5
the fact the fact that you are coming in

2309.07 --> 2313.3900000000003
here you know

2310.5 --> 2315.28
today and saying that you're upset and

2313.39 --> 2317.56
all the rest of it you doubt the good

2315.28 --> 2325.69
that you do in that very statement I

2317.56 --> 2326.92
mean no I disagree I myself I do it

2325.69 --> 2328.42
really listening we could have it a lot

2326.92 --> 2330.46
we can have it a lot we can have a lot

2328.42 --> 2335.7400000000002
worse than we have it of course of

2330.46 --> 2342.359
course and and so build on the platform

2335.74 --> 2346.41
of the positivity you know and and reach

2342.359 --> 2351.339
out of the way you're reaching out but

2346.41 --> 2357.22
don't deny don't deny that you have

2351.339 --> 2359.2599999999998
something to offer and it's you know if

2357.22 --> 2362.0499999999997
I listen back to the first time I came

2359.26 --> 2367.17
on your show without my face and I hear

2362.05 --> 2369.9300000000003
myself talking now you know I believe

2367.17 --> 2375.099
the difference of heart despite my

2369.93 --> 2378.97
despite my voice you know that day it's

2375.099 --> 2382.6600000000003
an emotion inside my thoughts it's a

2378.97 --> 2385.109
it's a it's a it's a way you've given me

2382.66 --> 2390.3689999999997
to look at the things that I've found is

2385.109 --> 2394.29
this tasteful and horrible and should

2390.369 --> 2399.4
you put rationale you'll be given me

2394.29 --> 2402.46
another insight and even the trolls that

2399.4 --> 2405.339
come here they can't help it they can't

2402.46 --> 2407.53
help with this it's like what what's he

2405.339 --> 2410.5
gonna say today I I just gotta say

2407.53 --> 2412.8390000000004
something so unoriginal suggested to

2410.5 --> 2417.369
make myself you feel like I'm pushing

2412.839 --> 2419.29
somebody down yes sir all of these all

2417.369 --> 2421.9900000000002
of these things you read you know

2419.29 --> 2423.4
there's a part of the brain you know

2421.99 --> 2425.77
this thing they say this is

2423.4 --> 2429.73
psychological yeah it's like a logic boo

2425.77 --> 2432.5099999999998
the thing is when you hear anything the

2429.73 --> 2435.43
brain what am i what am i he says ah

2432.51 --> 2437.92
that's me that's me that's me

2435.43 --> 2444.0389999999998
so if you read all of these hateful

2437.92 --> 2445.63
people could have truly a problem in in

2444.039 --> 2446.8590000000004
my eyes you know rather than like talk

2445.63 --> 2451.7200000000003
about the other day constructive

2446.859 --> 2453.339
criticism and you know a way to explain

2451.72 --> 2456.4599999999996
what someone did or how they're made of

2453.339 --> 2459.72
heal etcetera they just attack with the

2456.46 --> 2462.16
words what they consider wisdom or witty

2459.72 --> 2463.4199999999996
these are some of the worst comedians

2462.16 --> 2469.5389999999998
I've ever seen in my life

2463.42 --> 2472.15
you know little X money just just I

2469.539 --> 2477.5200000000004
don't know who is this funny thing

2472.15 --> 2480.549
well these trolls that come here you

2477.52 --> 2484.15
know right and and if you read those

2480.549 --> 2486.0099999999998
right and then you go to sleep and then

2484.15 --> 2487.4500000000003
you you know all that's processing

2486.01 --> 2492.75
whether you like it or not that's your

2487.45 --> 2496.96
subconscious true true so so you know

2492.75 --> 2501.27
you've got to focus and truly like it's

2496.96 --> 2504.549
a JM AG's base him I mean he this is hot

2501.27 --> 2508.869
he's he's here to listen to you he or

2504.549 --> 2514.21
she's here to listen to you and I don't

2508.869 --> 2517.1800000000003
know peanuts yeah I love you guys okay

2514.21 --> 2521.7
that's whatever I'm going through right

2517.18 --> 2526.18
now and being ultra pessimistic look

2521.7 --> 2528.97
it's weird it it is part of what I'm

2526.18 --> 2533.41
trying to I'm trying to make sense of it

2528.97 --> 2535.99
and yeah I do realize like you guys the

2533.41 --> 2539.3799999999997
people that come on the panel I am

2535.99 --> 2542.62
noticing that you are growing and

2539.38 --> 2545.23
almost like proud of you guys and I'm

2542.62 --> 2547.95
not saying that because of what I do you

2545.23 --> 2551.14
are turning to [ __ ] or something no it's

2547.95 --> 2555.3399999999997
everything else seems to have an

2551.14 --> 2558.4
opposite and equal reaction in the other

2555.34 --> 2563.56
direction and that is the part of that

2558.4 --> 2565.35
like yeah I know us guys and gals and

2563.56 --> 2569.74
that's nice

2565.35 --> 2573.31
but I can't look away from what is out

2569.74 --> 2577.33
there and it just feels like every time

2573.31 --> 2579.93
I try to do something good here yeah you

2577.33 --> 2582.73
guys in response it's like a garden

2579.93 --> 2585.43
spirit and it's great but then

2582.73 --> 2591.42
everything out there just seems to

2585.43 --> 2598.35
worsen in eco and opposite response and

2591.42 --> 2598.35
I find that absolutely fundamentally

2599.49 --> 2606.27
intolerable was the worst thing that

2603.73 --> 2606.27
happened today

2609.9 --> 2619.59
well in my direct surroundings not not

2613.65 --> 2625.26
much okay but do you have food for

2619.59 --> 2628.98
dinner not a lot but yeah I guess that

2625.26 --> 2629.73
what I am again and it makes me feel so

2628.98 --> 2632.67
stupid

2629.73 --> 2635.82
because yeah you guys have been helping

2632.67 --> 2641.16
me out financially okay and that is

2635.82 --> 2649.6200000000003
awesome what it seems like the more help

2641.16 --> 2652.68
I get the more it seems to just dissolve

2649.62 --> 2656.04
and nothing I I don't understand I

2652.68 --> 2660.5099999999998
should be having more because of what I

2656.04 --> 2662.7599999999998
got and again it's seems like it's

2660.51 --> 2664.8
exactly the same and that's not a good

2662.76 --> 2667.5600000000004
message to put out there like yeah those

2664.8 --> 2674.36
murder bTW yeah it does matter but it

2667.56 --> 2679.23
seems like even though I do get it it's

2674.36 --> 2682.52
it's not building I want it to build up

2679.23 --> 2688.11
I want like a reserve and then I can

2682.52 --> 2690.75
maybe do something with that but the

2688.11 --> 2694.6200000000003
super chats of course that's another

2690.75 --> 2696.87
thing that's just in wait but it seems

2694.62 --> 2700.23
like the more money I get the more it

2696.87 --> 2703.95
disintegrates right in front of me and I

2700.23 --> 2707.45
don't get it because I don't feel like

2703.95 --> 2710.8689999999997
I'm like expand yeah

2707.45 --> 2713.1189999999997
giving out more money absolutely not

2710.869 --> 2716.349
it just seems exactly the same it

2713.119 --> 2716.349
doesn't make any sense

2719.619 --> 2726.94
anyway I think you feel a responsibility

2722.579 --> 2731.38
and yeah I'm getting money so I must

2726.94 --> 2733.63
become wealthier it's a mandate it's a

2731.38 --> 2736.509
karmic man that you give me something I

2733.63 --> 2738.819
got a half this on top and it just feels

2736.509 --> 2742.799
like it's all disintegrating into

2738.819 --> 2749.229
nothing doesn't even feel like it's more

2742.799 --> 2753.64
that's like but again maybe it is just

2749.229 --> 2757.299
me going through this pessimist Valley

2753.64 --> 2759.999
another type of Valley not be the pain

2757.299 --> 2769.029
not the sensitivity Valley the overset

2759.999 --> 2771.2189999999996
but just in my mind just and I'm trying

2769.029 --> 2775.559
to quit smoking cannabis because of

2771.219 --> 2775.559
financial reasons and it haunts me

2781.61 --> 2787.4500000000003
well

2783.92 --> 2787.4500000000003
it's not an easy thing to do

2789.7 --> 2793.96
now the worst thing about it is that

2791.71 --> 2797.29
when you're poor it's actually kind of

2793.96 --> 2799.7200000000003
easy not to do it because you can't then

2797.29 --> 2802.48
when you actually get money that's when

2799.72 --> 2805.74
it becomes tough and that is the [ __ ]

2802.48 --> 2805.7400000000002
up thing about drugs

2807.26 --> 2813.05
because when you got money that's when

2809.6 --> 2819.65
it really starts that take a piece of

2813.05 --> 2821.6800000000003
your mind and just owns you and I hate

2819.65 --> 2821.6800000000003
it

2827.17 --> 2830.5
and I feel I've quit smoking oh well you

2830.02 --> 2832.54
lie on it

2830.5 --> 2835.84
I've Smyth quits well right and the bits

2832.54 --> 2836.47
for like five years in a row non-stop no

2835.84 --> 2838.57
problem

2836.47 --> 2841.8399999999997
well it was a problem it frickin

2838.57 --> 2844.7400000000002
depressed the [ __ ] out of me what I had

2841.84 --> 2844.7400000000002
a lot of distractions

2849.82 --> 2855.2200000000003
and there's always the constant worry

2851.62 --> 2856.72
isn't there you know no it's like well

2855.22 --> 2860.1699999999996
no that's what the week never explained

2856.72 --> 2863.23
to me when you get some more we've got

2860.17 --> 2865.03
some and at that moment you enjoy it and

2863.23 --> 2866.8
then there's that moment we have start

2865.03 --> 2869.13
wishing how much you got left and then

2866.8 --> 2871.9
there's a worry you we've got the song

2869.13 --> 2876.27
left but you'd never know how much you

2871.9 --> 2878.44
got there finding its moves too

2876.27 --> 2884.44
you know well at least I can have some

2878.44 --> 2886.77
now you know in it yeah yeah I know what

2884.44 --> 2889.93
you're going through

2886.77 --> 2893.62
it's believed I don't know if you know

2889.93 --> 2896.2
exactly because it's like I decided I'm

2893.62 --> 2898.7799999999997
trying to decide like yeah no I don't I

2896.2 --> 2900.37
just don't want to think about it

2898.78 --> 2904.3
anymore I don't need it

2900.37 --> 2909.93
I've actually feel better now because it

2904.3 --> 2911.8900000000003
gave me heart [ __ ] literally like heart

2909.93 --> 2915.6699999999996
palpitations or whatever you're gonna

2911.89 --> 2919.83
call it and it bothered me a lot I even

2915.67 --> 2923.89
explained this during the hard times

2919.83 --> 2928.69
those few weeks ago you know I don't do

2923.89 --> 2932.71
it really know over barely and and if

2928.69 --> 2934.69
that helps but for some reason there's

2932.71 --> 2937.26
just something else happening at the

2934.69 --> 2941.5
same time I don't know maybe it is just

2937.26 --> 2945.4500000000003
waking me up more in a way that I don't

2941.5 --> 2949.06
really want to I don't know what it is

2945.45 --> 2953.85
but I'm just thinking about yeah what

2949.06 --> 2958.06
what if the money like it's back again

2953.85 --> 2961.0299999999997
it's got a call me again it's gonna like

2958.06 --> 2963.52
it be like a troll get in my face and I

2961.03 --> 2965.38
won't get it out of my face it's gonna

2963.52 --> 2968.82
be looking me straight in the eye

2965.38 --> 2972.04
wherever I go even if I close my eyes

2968.82 --> 2976.1200000000003
that [ __ ] yeah and that only happens

2972.04 --> 2980.95
every time that yeah that the man

2976.12 --> 2983.29
is there yep exactly

2980.95 --> 2986.02
and then when them I hate him and I

2983.29 --> 2988.57
don't want that and it's available well

2986.02 --> 2990.31
no in the scenario when the money's

2988.57 --> 2994.0
you're getting low but it's available

2990.31 --> 2996.49
and you start dividing between guess my

2994.0 --> 3000.6
mean your car food on the table or all

2996.49 --> 3004.7
the addiction you know yeah all that I'm

3000.6 --> 3008.37
totally understand you yeah you know

3004.7 --> 3011.31
it's but that but that's really if you

3008.37 --> 3013.62
decide to go with it that's what happens

3011.31 --> 3017.88
when you really decide to go with it to

3013.62 --> 3019.7999999999997
live with it but when you don't when you

3017.88 --> 3022.05
decide to like no I don't want this

3019.8 --> 3025.26
anymore that's when it's really gonna

3022.05 --> 3027.7200000000003
stare you in the face that's when it's

3025.26 --> 3031.26
gonna become a absolute nightmare of

3027.72 --> 3034.7099999999996
your own conscience well let me share a

3031.26 --> 3040.59
little bit of a story with you again you

3034.71 --> 3043.23
know and you know the whole of last year

3040.59 --> 3048.42
I was smoking cannabis many years before

3043.23 --> 3051.3
that I had no job since my dad collapsed

3048.42 --> 3059.67
and I needed in my mind I needed it and

3051.3 --> 3062.19
I had no need to work because I had my

3059.67 --> 3065.67
house pay for my rent was paid for to

3062.19 --> 3067.86
have a break from everything and instead

3065.67 --> 3070.44
of capitalizing every day on the time

3067.86 --> 3072.7200000000003
that I had I was waking up there all

3070.44 --> 3075.63
different hours of the day not knowing

3072.72 --> 3079.31
what time it was feeling like I didn't

3075.63 --> 3079.31
even hear and

3080.12 --> 3088.66
a month is that from the Tuesday that

3083.51 --> 3092.5
just have that I've stopped completely I

3088.66 --> 3095.5699999999997
just I said these thoughts on my own

3092.5 --> 3098.99
who's benefiting from it the only person

3095.57 --> 3100.7000000000003
who benefited from it little piece in

3098.99 --> 3103.52
the middle where I felt a cave every

3100.7 --> 3105.41
other time it wouldn't worry wait am I

3103.52 --> 3109.67
gonna have enough is that a Mahina of is

3105.41 --> 3112.58
it gonna be there tomorrow I used it as

3109.67 --> 3117.14
a coping mechanism because I believed it

3112.58 --> 3120.62
was a coping mechanism after two weeks

3117.14 --> 3123.46
just after the two weeks they were hot

3120.62 --> 3127.22
flashes they were headaches I was

3123.46 --> 3129.62
sitting in my room constantly needing to

3127.22 --> 3131.54
throw up just sitting in my car outside

3129.62 --> 3134.48
where it was breeze I was out there from

3131.54 --> 3136.82
10:30 at night till 2:30 in the morning

3134.48 --> 3139.7
until my body had absolutely purged

3136.82 --> 3142.34
itself I had eaten good food all that

3139.7 --> 3144.02
day but my body with the time there was

3142.34 --> 3149.9300000000003
time to catch the chicks that I hadn't

3144.02 --> 3152.18
been you know deserving and when I went

3149.93 --> 3157.97
to see my brother and on the trip that

3152.18 --> 3159.9199999999996
you helped me with I told him did you

3157.97 --> 3163.8999999999996
hear that I have because he always told

3159.92 --> 3165.5
me hey you've always called me a peanut

3163.9 --> 3167.96
yes

3165.5 --> 3169.7
sorry always a peanuts Clara and to

3167.96 --> 3172.94
justice it wanted to say hello

3169.7 --> 3174.3199999999997
yeah good to continue yeah a peanuts hey

3172.94 --> 3178.7000000000003
good morning morning

3174.32 --> 3182.78
yeah sorry Katina and so when I saw him

3178.7 --> 3184.8199999999997
he had he had been given the update cuz

3182.78 --> 3187.94
that's a you know it's always me we put

3184.82 --> 3189.6200000000003
my shadow before his I might be doing in

3187.94 --> 3192.62
this finale but what he's doing you know

3189.62 --> 3194.75
type mentality and when I said to him he

3192.62 --> 3196.88
heard obviously say yeah I heard and

3194.75 --> 3199.78
he's looking at me like I'm back on it

3196.88 --> 3202.4
type thing it's in that ain't going back

3199.78 --> 3204.23
instantly he tries to justify his own

3202.4 --> 3207.38
life oh it's okay

3204.23 --> 3209.119
yeah he's because all of a sudden he's

3207.38 --> 3213.6800000000003
in a position that he never saw thought

3209.119 --> 3219.07
I'd be in and it's a position that I

3213.68 --> 3219.0699999999997
never thought I'd be but I tell you what

3219.49 --> 3229.339
even if you just take a break from it

3223.27 --> 3231.92
did you get another view then that's

3229.339 --> 3234.5
better than believing the whole time

3231.92 --> 3239.81
that you need it even if you cut it down

3234.5 --> 3244.46
and you give it to yourself every new

3239.81 --> 3247.609
moon every full moon if once a week you

3244.46 --> 3250.13
know and then break yourself up into

3247.609 --> 3252.5299999999997
just you forgetting that you put there

3250.13 --> 3254.1800000000003
was time to smoke it I mean these these

3252.53 --> 3262.9300000000003
are the things where it can I can't

3254.18 --> 3262.93
control you but it's vices of any nature

3264.04 --> 3275.44
by in the instance not so much evil but

3270.069 --> 3279.71
they're not off the light you know and

3275.44 --> 3283.819
you've got enough light in you and the

3279.71 --> 3286.9900000000002
up and down emotions you know that we go

3283.819 --> 3290.42
through you know me

3286.99 --> 3294.6499999999996
only just recently stopping you know

3290.42 --> 3297.5
there was an irritation there was you

3294.65 --> 3299.69
know restlessness it was the

3297.5 --> 3304.96
restlessness there was waking up at

3299.69 --> 3309.56
different hours there was dreams where I

3304.96 --> 3311.0
got high in my dream and I woke up

3309.56 --> 3313.7599999999998
you're feeling guilty because I thought

3311.0 --> 3316.069
it was real I mean realizing oh thank

3313.76 --> 3319.369
goodness I didn't break my promise to

3316.069 --> 3321.829
myself you know and when the mother more

3319.369 --> 3324.38
than one take over that makes it to me

3321.829 --> 3326.69
it's a month of today you know it oh

3324.38 --> 3330.98
yeah I completely forgot you know my

3326.69 --> 3336.589
mother was the goal but you know

3330.98 --> 3340.91
and I tell you what my integers show and

3336.589 --> 3343.0099999999998
I had to stop then you know I didn't

3340.91 --> 3347.1189999999997
even know that that was actually

3343.01 --> 3350.349
happening at the time exactly exactly

3347.119 --> 3352.67
and and and I haven't told anyone

3350.349 --> 3358.339
obviously didn't or than the people and

3352.67 --> 3360.29
I haven't let you know but you know I'm

3358.339 --> 3365.3289999999997
not afraid to say that if it had a

3360.29 --> 3368.39
control on me I would have a stressful

3365.329 --> 3372.349
situation and I wouldn't think to myself

3368.39 --> 3378.02
oh that's alright it's alright but I

3372.349 --> 3379.52
tell you what as I began to clear up my

3378.02 --> 3381.77
mind I mean I'm still got a long way to

3379.52 --> 3387.65
go it's only been a month and I've been

3381.77 --> 3388.22
smoking for so many years that this

3387.65 --> 3391.9100000000003
month

3388.22 --> 3395.0
you know this introduced by my family

3391.91 --> 3396.6189999999997
was all my mama dead it was never a bad

3395.0 --> 3399.589
thing it wasn't it was it was a social

3396.619 --> 3401.21
thing it was never you know and now that

3399.589 --> 3404.15
the thing that I was introduced to

3401.21 --> 3407.18
brother family this is now turned on me

3404.15 --> 3409.849
and used against me look what you doing

3407.18 --> 3411.8289999999997
this is this and so they began to you

3409.849 --> 3413.7200000000003
know society people around me began to

3411.829 --> 3416.21
put me at a level and a level that I

3413.72 --> 3418.79
almost like a barrier across my you know

3416.21 --> 3421.76
we couldn't you know see myself out of

3418.79 --> 3423.29
it and I was accepting of that but it's

3421.76 --> 3427.5200000000004
That moment when you realize all those

3423.29 --> 3430.0099999999998
thoughts those things that come crashing

3427.52 --> 3430.88
in like arrows to your brain that's not

3430.01 --> 3433.6090000000004
from God

3430.88 --> 3436.099
that's not from the light that's from

3433.609 --> 3438.7999999999997
just the negative that's the thing that

3436.099 --> 3441.23
feeds off the pain and suffering of

3438.8 --> 3445.069
those who choose to do evil and cause

3441.23 --> 3449.18
harm those things those are the things

3445.069 --> 3451.94
that grab you those way that's why you

3449.18 --> 3456.94
miserable empowering how much because

3451.94 --> 3459.9700000000003
it's not you and that moment you

3456.94 --> 3462.339
you start to realize this like wow look

3459.97 --> 3464.47
what I look what I saw like look look

3462.339 --> 3467.2
like look what I did with my days you

3464.47 --> 3469.45
know Anna you can look at myself in the

3467.2 --> 3471.22
mirror can be honest with the person

3469.45 --> 3472.359
rather than you get hotter than myself

3471.22 --> 3474.4599999999996
in the mirror how can you deal with you

3472.359 --> 3479.0099999999998
today you know I can I can deal with

3474.46 --> 3482.319
life today do with it as somebody who

3479.01 --> 3488.2000000000003
was how so greatly from your words of

3482.319 --> 3493.48
wisdom your insight I just I just want

3488.2 --> 3497.14
you to know that with the timing it was

3493.48 --> 3505.0
perfect you know given from God that

3497.14 --> 3506.3799999999997
what you told me you know and it just it

3505.0 --> 3508.93
showed me like I couldn't heal even

3506.38 --> 3512.079
ridges it what you told me though that

3508.93 --> 3515.319
night the first time we spoke if I was

3512.079 --> 3517.48
to smoking if I was leaving the brain

3515.319 --> 3520.5099999999998
I've had some amazing times you know

3517.48 --> 3523.63
some revelations great synchronous this

3520.51 --> 3527.4300000000003
thing just amazing connection all these

3523.63 --> 3530.4100000000003
different things but I've done it now

3527.43 --> 3537.2
it's time to take the future back that I

3530.41 --> 3540.1099999999997
want for myself you know and

3537.2 --> 3543.43
p'tee interactions with people have

3540.11 --> 3547.58
become so easy because I'm one person

3543.43 --> 3549.44
one mind again you know I can I'm the

3547.58 --> 3551.21
same as I wake up is when I go to bit

3549.44 --> 3554.06
there's no up and down there's no are

3551.21 --> 3555.89
and anymore though you know I'm laughing

3554.06 --> 3559.97
that's the same things I used to say I

3555.89 --> 3561.41
could only enjoy if I was hot and so

3559.97 --> 3563.48
that's me

3561.41 --> 3566.54
and I'm not saying that everybody has to

3563.48 --> 3568.88
do what I do oh that's how you do it but

3566.54 --> 3572.35
I'm just saying it's like these these

3568.88 --> 3574.85
thoughts that I sorta come rushing in

3572.35 --> 3576.88
and then to doubt in the whirring all

3574.85 --> 3581.72
these things it's not necessary

3576.88 --> 3587.33
and now when I speak about God and faces

3581.72 --> 3588.7099999999996
and everything it feels true like I

3587.33 --> 3590.84
wouldn't have cool I wouldn't have

3588.71 --> 3593.66
joined the show and spoken to you I

3590.84 --> 3595.9700000000003
wouldn't have spoken just peanuts clack

3593.66 --> 3599.62
with the words that I was able to you to

3595.97 --> 3601.58
give him they wouldn't have beamed there

3599.62 --> 3606.64
you know they would have come across

3601.58 --> 3610.61
from all sorts of angles you know and so

3606.64 --> 3613.8799999999997
you know I I was thanking by peanut

3610.61 --> 3615.44
thank about you but it took you to give

3613.88 --> 3617.51
me to that position so I could go and

3615.44 --> 3619.88
deal with the people who had written

3617.51 --> 3625.5200000000004
written me off you could come back and

3619.88 --> 3626.9300000000003
say haha you never say never and now now

3625.52 --> 3628.82
they're all reeling from the feeling

3626.93 --> 3631.91
they have no idea they now look at their

3628.82 --> 3633.65
own lives and addicted to cigarettes and

3631.91 --> 3636.35
alcohol is crutches plus they have

3633.65 --> 3640.4300000000003
cannabis you know you know it's like

3636.35 --> 3645.65
it's it's just turning the tables or

3640.43 --> 3648.77
both on my thought patterns in and out

3645.65 --> 3653.26
of me and then sometimes this is what it

3648.77 --> 3656.46
takes but your direction and what you do

3653.26 --> 3659.13
it's amazing

3656.46 --> 3661.89
and you don't see it because you're so

3659.13 --> 3663.75
humble in just now and and stop

3661.89 --> 3667.02
flattering me I get it

3663.75 --> 3671.22
I think I get it it's not me it I'm just

3667.02 --> 3673.32
a cog in the sea it's God doing it and

3671.22 --> 3678.0299999999997
apparently he chose to do that through

3673.32 --> 3682.8
me it's not me okay you're done right I

3678.03 --> 3685.5
just happened as a song you know the

3682.8 --> 3689.07
lyrics of this song you just call on

3685.5 --> 3692.73
your brother when you need a hand we all

3689.07 --> 3696.0
need somebody to lean on that doesn't

3692.73 --> 3699.03
mean that you make that person your

3696.0 --> 3700.59
constant war it means that when you're

3699.03 --> 3704.2200000000003
feeling weary there's something to

3700.59 --> 3706.23
support you and you supported me I saw

3704.22 --> 3708.7799999999997
you on the show today just distraught

3706.23 --> 3712.83
we're talking before you started and I

3708.78 --> 3714.9900000000002
didn't even realize so I I'm here I'm

3712.83 --> 3722.37
your brother from New Zealand you know

3714.99 --> 3726.99
and you know it's it's it's what it is

3722.37 --> 3730.2
you know and whatever this is I'm

3726.99 --> 3732.1499999999996
blessed to be able to even be online to

3730.2 --> 3735.24
have the ability and the devices to talk

3732.15 --> 3740.96
to you to tell you thank you you keep

3735.24 --> 3748.41
your head up you know and you direct you

3740.96 --> 3753.15
and I can't I can't I can't you know say

3748.41 --> 3759.27
anything any other way but you I'm not

3753.15 --> 3762.27
here you know where you are and I'm not

3759.27 --> 3767.1
here where I am but everything is where

3762.27 --> 3769.44
it is and everything is moving in the

3767.1 --> 3772.02
way it does even though even the trolls

3769.44 --> 3775.17
here they get a listen they have to read

3772.02 --> 3779.73
they have to evaluate why even a

3775.17 --> 3783.63
question why and that's what I had to do

3779.73 --> 3786.57
is like why why am I gonna do that why

3783.63 --> 3788.03
do I need to feel like that why and so

3786.57 --> 3791.09
when I ask you questions

3788.03 --> 3793.4300000000003
me young reason why this is all there

3791.09 --> 3796.61
you know and then we're sharing

3793.43 --> 3801.23
information you know and we're using the

3796.61 --> 3803.9300000000003
system of the internet that was meant

3801.23 --> 3805.61
you know in a way to divide us because

3803.93 --> 3808.8799999999997
now we can take a photo and judge the

3805.61 --> 3812.4500000000003
color and the size and the gender and

3808.88 --> 3813.8
the things you you know staff and all

3812.45 --> 3817.04
the different things that we can just

3813.8 --> 3820.28
you know I'll bring up his Twitter to

3817.04 --> 3823.13
bring up his Facebook blah blah instant

3820.28 --> 3830.15
gravity nation that's what yeah yeah

3823.13 --> 3834.9500000000003
exactly and and so few people can

3830.15 --> 3838.04
actually just open the platform that you

3834.95 --> 3841.7
do to welcome on someone to talk you

3838.04 --> 3843.98
know and I I just you know that's true

3841.7 --> 3850.1499999999996
yeah I wouldn't have I wouldn't have him

3843.98 --> 3853.88
I wouldn't have had the the the words

3850.15 --> 3857.63
wouldn't have had with the calmness that

3853.88 --> 3860.87
I went on my trip with if you didn't

3857.63 --> 3865.1600000000003
take the time and so now I'm taking the

3860.87 --> 3871.31
time to say here kaha like I told you

3865.16 --> 3875.48
we'd be strong and you know his peanuts

3871.31 --> 3880.25
that I'm you you know and ready to say

3875.48 --> 3886.01
hello you know so thank you thank you I

3880.25 --> 3888.85
know I get it I guess I really just

3886.01 --> 3892.1000000000004
needed somebody like AI feel like [ __ ] I

3888.85 --> 3895.19
can comfort me a little because it just

3892.1 --> 3899.2
feels really shitty and also I look

3895.19 --> 3902.33
besides the cannabis I'm worried because

3899.2 --> 3907.79
I'm drinking wine a lot

3902.33 --> 3911.0299999999997
now and it seems like it is it's it's

3907.79 --> 3917.33
like a temporary replacement but I'm

3911.03 --> 3921.82
afraid of it it's I get this feeling

3917.33 --> 3931.48
like I can't really retract and nothing

3921.82 --> 3935.09
you know it's and in a way the wine

3931.48 --> 3938.62
makes me feel good

3935.09 --> 3941.9900000000002
not over-the-top it has an obvious

3938.62 --> 3944.6
noticeable downside and it feels more in

3941.99 --> 3947.06
balance actually than when I was smoking

3944.6 --> 3949.88
cannabis it's a really weird sensation

3947.06 --> 3953.57
like yeah maybe a red wine addiction

3949.88 --> 3955.9100000000003
would be more sensible than cannabis

3953.57 --> 3957.7400000000002
addiction because it's not gonna cost as

3955.91 --> 3960.0099999999998
much if you take too much you just get

3957.74 --> 3963.3799999999997
physically sick and puke it out and

3960.01 --> 3966.05
you'll always have the down side which

3963.38 --> 3970.7000000000003
is not financial but actually physical

3966.05 --> 3974.98
so it's better to oversee but then again

3970.7 --> 3974.98
yeah it's freaking alcohol you know and

3975.46 --> 3982.7
like alcohol is worse this world this

3980.12 --> 3984.2
world this world is not an easy world to

3982.7 --> 3987.95
live in and it certainly hasn't been

3984.2 --> 3990.68
made easier you know yeah Warner its but

3987.95 --> 3993.47
but that's the thing it's like profit

3990.68 --> 3995.93
margin but it's so it's so weird and

3993.47 --> 3998.45
compass I'm gonna break through a moment

3995.93 --> 4000.0699999999997
almost dispel but not really because you

3998.45 --> 4003.1299999999997
made really good points and they're

4000.07 --> 4006.28
right on target you got it but it's like

4003.13 --> 4010.1800000000003
the extremity of this world what I've

4006.28 --> 4011.6800000000003
been noticing it if I smell cannabis it

4010.18 --> 4014.98
drives me insane

4011.68 --> 4017.5299999999997
it's like cannabis enhances things but

4014.98 --> 4021.09
it's already too strong well the alcohol

4017.53 --> 4025.3
actually gives it a little and just

4021.09 --> 4028.589
makes me more able to enjoy the parts

4025.3 --> 4031.5890000000004
that I choose to enjoy of it

4028.589 --> 4033.779
and that's why this switch seems to have

4031.589 --> 4034.459
happen because cannabis just drives me

4033.779 --> 4040.769
nuts

4034.459 --> 4042.689
now chemically chemically cannabis

4040.769 --> 4043.9199999999996
alters the firing patterns of the

4042.689 --> 4047.18
neurons in your brain

4043.92 --> 4051.029
so rather than ABCD you might go to DC a

4047.18 --> 4052.9199999999996
b c d a a BBC and you might that's all

4051.029 --> 4054.479
of incredible revelation yeah you might

4052.92 --> 4058.17
have revelation but then all of a sudden

4054.479 --> 4059.7889999999998
you might have an over influx of of the

4058.17 --> 4062.009
of the weight that you were feeling

4059.789 --> 4065.3390000000004
because now now you're seeing more

4062.009 --> 4067.7690000000002
negative sides unnecessarily open of a

4065.339 --> 4071.279
not so negative thing and it Hans's it

4067.769 --> 4073.979
you know like for me i used to smoke

4071.279 --> 4079.709
cannabis because i miss my partner like

4073.979 --> 4083.3289999999997
crazy you know and then i was planning

4079.709 --> 4086.6699999999996
to leave in december but between

4083.329 --> 4088.9790000000003
November 13th and December 1st that's

4086.67 --> 4091.17
when my father's mind was poisoned and I

4088.979 --> 4093.6789999999996
was considered a untrustable my money

4091.17 --> 4096.659
was taken back and you know all because

4093.679 --> 4099.54
my shadow was put in front of my my

4096.659 --> 4102.5689999999995
brother's shadow and you know there is

4099.54 --> 4103.469
no shadow no I'm transparent you know

4102.569 --> 4107.4890000000005
thank you

4103.469 --> 4109.409
and so there's nothing it is not like I

4107.489 --> 4113.598999999999
said I'm the same person when I wake up

4109.409 --> 4116.79
in the morning when I go to bed you know

4113.599 --> 4121.92
it's just it's just the way it is and

4116.79 --> 4123.659
and for me it was a necessary step you

4121.92 --> 4126.089
know a glass of wine with food and

4123.659 --> 4129.0
everything's fine but not finishing a

4126.089 --> 4132.839
bottle or two like my father does who's

4129.0 --> 4139.369
already sick you know to excess so

4132.839 --> 4139.369
everyone's different but lit you know

4140.38 --> 4148.299
I don't know let your worries their

4144.219 --> 4153.52
worries be present but don't look at the

4148.299 --> 4155.339
worry as you know an unconquered boo in

4153.52 --> 4157.4800000000005
comfortable uncomfortable thing

4155.339 --> 4159.79
something that can't be conquered

4157.48 --> 4162.129999999999
something but but but I don't see it

4159.79 --> 4164.049
like that the problem is is that I'm

4162.13 --> 4166.92
actually quite aware there's nothing I

4164.049 --> 4174.819
can do about it but just sit through it

4166.92 --> 4176.9490000000005
and my mind doesn't like that I want to

4174.819 --> 4179.650000000001
be able to do something about it and

4176.949 --> 4182.469
it's quite blatantly obvious to me that

4179.65 --> 4185.679
I can't and that is actually the thing

4182.469 --> 4188.889
that is just maniacally frustrating me

4185.679 --> 4192.7300000000005
in this moment and also it has to do

4188.889 --> 4196.09
with the whole spectrum of everything I

4192.73 --> 4199.419999999999
went through it first the pressure on my

4196.09 --> 4202.0
shoulders in my heart just going nuts my

4199.42 --> 4206.52
mind just being super clear and

4202.0 --> 4212.4
everything and actually movie and then

4206.52 --> 4214.719
me going nuts for a moment and just

4212.4 --> 4218.739
trying to breathe through tracting and

4214.719 --> 4221.409
then the back thing because yeah I I got

4218.739 --> 4223.629999999999
an issue it pretty much started three

4221.409 --> 4226.929
days ago and it it's normal it's the

4223.63 --> 4228.639
normal cycle of this always something

4226.929 --> 4231.88
like this happens it happens to my dad

4228.639 --> 4234.7300000000005
as well he even said like two weeks ago

4231.88 --> 4237.46
he had that because it's apparently in

4234.73 --> 4241.239
the family that's the the the after

4237.46 --> 4245.07
effect but it's so in the way and the

4241.239 --> 4250.19
way I feel like my back it's not as bad

4245.07 --> 4256.429
it was like two days ago but it was

4250.19 --> 4259.219
bad enough yesterday like I did my

4256.429 --> 4263.09
newspaper rounds I do it every Wednesday

4259.219 --> 4265.88
I did it yesterday even though my back

4263.09 --> 4267.92
was killing me and I was like yeah [ __ ]

4265.88 --> 4269.9890000000005
my back killing me I'm gonna do this and

4267.92 --> 4272.81
I'm gonna suffer it and I'm gonna like

4269.989 --> 4275.0
it I'm gonna like suffering under it I'm

4272.81 --> 4276.88
gonna feel like one of these employees

4275.0 --> 4280.88
that's literally destroying themselves

4276.88 --> 4284.900000000001
to work to to the glory of God that [ __ ]

4280.88 --> 4288.92
and I did that and I almost fainted a

4284.9 --> 4291.19
few times cause of like certain shocks

4288.92 --> 4294.5
that would happen unexpectedly it like

4291.19 --> 4298.3099999999995
prevent myself from collapsing it was it

4294.5 --> 4301.07
was insane just freakin newspapers and

4298.31 --> 4305.679
it was dangerous what i was doing and i

4301.07 --> 4309.049999999999
jus enjoyed it but now afterwards this

4305.679 --> 4312.86
it is happening the next day and also

4309.05 --> 4317.1990000000005
like after that i got wine and i drank

4312.86 --> 4322.04
it and i drank more than one wall like

4317.199 --> 4326.5599999999995
like what the hell it my attempt to do

4322.04 --> 4329.81
something extremely right righteous

4326.56 --> 4332.27
actually had an elastic effect and made

4329.81 --> 4337.909000000001
me go too far in the other direction and

4332.27 --> 4340.610000000001
it's like what is this I try to do

4337.909 --> 4345.949
something really right and immediately I

4340.61 --> 4349.639
got a back a backlash running off going

4345.949 --> 4352.638999999999
the other way too much I do it too much

4349.639 --> 4357.29
good something too much bad happens

4352.639 --> 4359.57
overcomes me I I felt pride like yeah I

4357.29 --> 4362.06
did it I conquered the challenge and now

4359.57 --> 4364.25
I'm gonna enjoy the hangouts with wine

4362.06 --> 4368.869000000001
and I'm gonna go a little bit too far

4364.25 --> 4374.15
and now afterwards it's like why

4368.869 --> 4376.98
why didn't I just do it moderately why

4374.15 --> 4387.768999999999
because it only cost me more money now

4376.98 --> 4392.098999999999
and oh my god I didn't even want to

4387.769 --> 4396.3
interrupt y'all so slow no no it's your

4392.099 --> 4400.349
turn now thanks for coming I hope you I

4396.3 --> 4405.03
hope you guys are doing well and I just

4400.349 --> 4407.719
wanted to you know a lot of things went

4405.03 --> 4411.139
through my mind yesterday bad no I

4407.719 --> 4413.28
hadn't you know I hadn't had a good day

4411.139 --> 4419.67
something negatively did happen to me

4413.28 --> 4421.71
but I didn't let it faze me and I just

4419.67 --> 4425.07
really started thinking you know and and

4421.71 --> 4430.53
just kind of like you said earlier you

4425.07 --> 4432.179
know I'm being that a brother in need

4430.53 --> 4434.369
you know somebody so somebody who's

4432.179 --> 4436.829
there for you and or one made a comment

4434.369 --> 4439.86
saying just once somebody to cover him

4436.829 --> 4442.53
you know and I just started thinking

4439.86 --> 4447.199
really hard about this this this globe

4442.53 --> 4450.449
lie and what it really means to me and

4447.199 --> 4453.469
you know what what if you know because

4450.449 --> 4455.848999999999
we can what what we can observe it is

4453.469 --> 4460.769
beautiful and amazing we can observe the

4455.849 --> 4466.860000000001
stars we can observe life right before

4460.769 --> 4470.969
our eyes you know and what if there's

4466.86 --> 4475.289
somewhere on this earth that when we

4470.969 --> 4481.92
observe it it makes us fall to our needs

4475.289 --> 4483.719
and to me that that's the own that's the

4481.92 --> 4486.84
biggest thing it could be there there

4483.719 --> 4491.099
has to be something on this earth and

4486.84 --> 4495.6900000000005
that it just sets it right in there

4491.099 --> 4498.860000000001
horse does that make sense maybe whether

4495.69 --> 4498.86
whether it be

4498.91 --> 4507.48
there'd be something at the North Pole

4501.0 --> 4509.56
or whether it be something out far away

4507.48 --> 4512.049999999999
of course I don't know what's out there

4509.56 --> 4515.830000000001
I'm gonna been there the ants are so

4512.05 --> 4519.85
edge or anything out there right but

4515.83 --> 4526.39
imagine imagine seeing something that

4519.85 --> 4530.97
just 100% shows that you are creating

4526.39 --> 4535.39
and whatever we're in is creative but

4530.97 --> 4540.7300000000005
how would that that's weird how would

4535.39 --> 4543.04
something how would it look like well

4540.73 --> 4546.129999999999
that is exactly what it would suggest

4543.04 --> 4551.17
because to me everything already does

4546.13 --> 4552.58
suggest exactly that really every detail

4551.17 --> 4555.01
of everything around us

4552.58 --> 4559.3
and you want to see Beauty peanuts you

4555.01 --> 4562.54
want to see intricate design yeah I'm s

4559.3 --> 4565.12
I see it all around understand like what

4562.54 --> 4568.75
I'd be really really really intricate

4565.12 --> 4574.42
design never never look at any videos of

4568.75 --> 4579.75
color electron microscope images yeah

4574.42 --> 4579.75
Mike responded to say a microscope yeah

4579.99 --> 4589.719999999999
like mine the electron microscope ten

4586.3 --> 4592.77
thousand magnification you're telling me

4589.72 --> 4598.42
there's no creator no intelligent design

4592.77 --> 4603.01
please I'm just telling you right now it

4598.42 --> 4607.99
will it will it will comfort you knowing

4603.01 --> 4610.570000000001
the detail in a single house fly little

4607.99 --> 4611.139999999999
own every butterfly wing or anything

4610.57 --> 4614.82
else

4611.14 --> 4619.29
you know that's wit war on your hand

4614.82 --> 4623.44
there's like a video cold like images

4619.29 --> 4626.32
you know like electron microscope images

4623.44 --> 4628.719999999999
hot one and two I looked at hot two and

4626.32 --> 4630.63
it was about twelve minutes 12 minutes

4628.72 --> 4633.84
long and it

4630.63 --> 4638.13
that I could not take my eyes off the

4633.84 --> 4640.77
screen and I began to just feel that if

4638.13 --> 4645.66
that's a fly-in offensive butterfly wing

4640.77 --> 4648.450000000001
and that's this how special how we you

4645.66 --> 4650.97
know we have a consciousness to choose

4648.45 --> 4654.69
how bad our day is going rather than

4650.97 --> 4659.1
like a like your room it like a remedial

4654.69 --> 4660.96
I like a memory of out all right the

4659.1 --> 4663.3
other day I ate that I did this with my

4660.96 --> 4665.43
mouth and I put food and then I didn't

4663.3 --> 4666.87
you know I mean it's like a an animal

4665.43 --> 4669.72
response to feed itself there's more

4666.87 --> 4671.7
primal than a human who decides you know

4669.72 --> 4674.280000000001
I'm gonna have pizza tonight do I'm a

4671.7 --> 4676.59
chicken now you know what I mean so just

4674.28 --> 4679.17
go you know you can eat with the things

4676.59 --> 4683.610000000001
that technology does for the benefit of

4679.17 --> 4691.86
mankind and womankind and humans in

4683.61 --> 4695.12
general it's amazing and it makes you

4691.86 --> 4698.61
look at just everything differently and

4695.12 --> 4700.65
yeah you just you do it in your own time

4698.61 --> 4704.37
and it's only a recommendation if you do

4700.65 --> 4708.8099999999995
it off but yeah it blew me away

4704.37 --> 4710.97
the answer is inward that's major yeah

4708.81 --> 4714.9800000000005
that's where you find the truth in words

4710.97 --> 4720.780000000001
and this is reflected upon by the wisest

4714.98 --> 4723.99
known humans so is finally want to find

4720.78 --> 4728.61
the truth look inward from every

4723.99 --> 4731.46
conceivable perspective of that word

4728.61 --> 4733.38
and yeah maybe there is something

4731.46 --> 4736.139
miraculous out there though not

4733.38 --> 4741.9890000000005
excluding it no there's been stories of

4736.139 --> 4745.38
like rivers going onward that no thing

4741.989 --> 4747.379999999999
so maybe there is something amazing out

4745.38 --> 4751.679
there somewhere

4747.38 --> 4753.329
why else would these with these certain

4751.679 --> 4756.42
parts of the earth

4753.329 --> 4758.099
be cut off towards us what why are we

4756.42 --> 4761.099
not allowing they're the only thing I

4758.099 --> 4769.079
can think of is there's something there

4761.099 --> 4771.869000000001
that really puts it in there has to be

4769.079 --> 4775.28
something really either amazing there or

4771.869 --> 4779.4
something there really lets us know

4775.28 --> 4780.349
either what we're in or who we are does

4779.4 --> 4783.089999999999
that make sense

4780.349 --> 4786.4490000000005
well it will reveal the other side

4783.09 --> 4789.71
basically and it's funny because in my

4786.449 --> 4793.129999999999
mind recently I've been conceptualizing

4789.71 --> 4795.9890000000005
something new which is probably very old

4793.13 --> 4797.82
it made me think like there's a circle

4795.989 --> 4800.339999999999
of the earth and then there's the four

4797.82 --> 4805.44
corners and together they're like a

4800.34 --> 4808.889
square but what what if what if the

4805.44 --> 4811.549999999999
corners of that square are actually

4808.889 --> 4811.55
Mount Meru

4812.949 --> 4819.259999999999
yeah what if they if you'd fold them

4816.86 --> 4822.369
together even though there are all flat

4819.26 --> 4827.869000000001
but if the corners fold it together make

4822.369 --> 4831.17
Mount Meru with four rivers and that is

4827.869 --> 4832.308999999999
the miracle basically that is it's not

4831.17 --> 4839.32
that the North Pole

4832.309 --> 4841.820000000001
it is the South Pole yesterday as I was

4839.32 --> 4845.03
watching all the chemtrails being

4841.82 --> 4850.82
sprayed and I started thinking about the

4845.03 --> 4853.55
seasons and you know who could could

4850.82 --> 4857.11
they be that good you could could they

4853.55 --> 4859.159000000001
could they be making the seasons you

4857.11 --> 4861.53
know faking it

4859.159 --> 4863.9
what do you mean not faking it but could

4861.53 --> 4866.449
they you know because we we feel

4863.9 --> 4869.089999999999
different times of the year you know we

4866.449 --> 4872.509999999999
see the leaves fall off and then we see

4869.09 --> 4879.469
we see them grow you know could could

4872.51 --> 4883.999
they be that good D know the Creator mmm

4879.469 --> 4888.019
you know that the mysterious they oh the

4883.999 --> 4890.8
controllers right the opposing could

4888.019 --> 4895.63
could they be that good the opposing

4890.8 --> 4898.729
separate one say our seasons even real

4895.63 --> 4900.8
yeah I think they are but I think they

4898.729 --> 4905.269
are a natural consequence of the

4900.8 --> 4908.329000000001
energies and yeah maybe the controllers

4905.269 --> 4910.249
do have influence on these energies they

4908.329 --> 4916.07
have management they might have

4910.249 --> 4918.679
management control but yeah what are you

4916.07 --> 4922.13
gonna do with it because the original

4918.679 --> 4924.17
program just works best naturally so

4922.13 --> 4926.679
they may be fooling around with it

4924.17 --> 4930.76
tinkering slightly or trying it out

4926.679 --> 4930.76
experimenting but

4930.889 --> 4935.4490000000005
I think that the seasons are just

4933.23 --> 4938.0199999999995
naturally present as part of the design

4935.449 --> 4938.0199999999995
of this world

4940.489 --> 4949.218999999999
I tried to I tried I tried the Sundays

4943.309 --> 4954.409000000001
yesterday and that it didn't feel right

4949.219 --> 4956.059
it made me nauseous and it didn't it

4954.409 --> 4960.4
didn't feel and didn't feel right I

4956.059 --> 4963.400000000001
couldn't really do it wait what oh

4960.4 --> 4967.78
you'll find me have you ever Sundays

4963.4 --> 4973.489
sorry it's all the same to me okay well

4967.78 --> 4975.438999999999
you know I took notice about these great

4973.489 --> 4978.079
lights in the sky and night I take

4975.439 --> 4981.1990000000005
notice at what angle they're going on in

4978.079 --> 4989.63
my head and it does change because

4981.199 --> 4994.999
change and what sense so so like like

4989.63 --> 4995.900000000001
last night I had to look straight up to

4994.999 --> 4998.749
see the moon

4995.9 --> 5001.239
I acted to tilt my head all the way all

4998.749 --> 5004.36
the way back and then the moon is

5001.239 --> 5006.879999999999
entwined over my head and then a couple

5004.36 --> 5011.789
of months ago I could look I could look

5006.88 --> 5011.789
almost 45 degrees and I could see all

5012.179 --> 5020.86
right so it does make the sense that if

5016.889 --> 5021.969
something is is moving in and out so

5020.86 --> 5026.549999999999
something's moving in and out like

5021.969 --> 5029.199
oscillations right cyclical nature

5026.55 --> 5034.51
oscillation cyclical nature it's all

5029.199 --> 5037.499
cyclical energy cyclicality phase

5034.51 --> 5037.499
cyclicality

5038.229 --> 5043.929
swing of the pendulum I talk about it

5041.17 --> 5050.369
all the time everything to me is

5043.929 --> 5054.01
obviously cyclical sound like sound and

5050.369 --> 5059.949
yeah they're from you can reason back

5054.01 --> 5063.219
that God spoke and the word became it

5059.949 --> 5064.659
all because a word is sound and a sound

5063.219 --> 5067.809
is cyclical

5064.659 --> 5070.57
so maybe God's Word is what has

5067.809 --> 5075.28
manifested all things in its cyclical

5070.57 --> 5078.67
nature as it and everything filled in

5075.28 --> 5083.11
between automatically by the design of

5078.67 --> 5090.429
it well it's very ethereal

5083.11 --> 5092.079
but yeah so oh yeah

5090.429 --> 5094.829
forgive me I forgot you know what can I

5092.079 --> 5097.09
call you cuz you gotta give a long name

5094.829 --> 5099.699
people and all these people can see

5097.09 --> 5103.9890000000005
can't see you can pull me wreath can't

5099.699 --> 5107.32
read snow carries no no me wreath great

5103.989 --> 5109.268999999999
okay thank you it's gonna be different

5107.32 --> 5112.38
for me because it always it will always

5109.269 --> 5115.119000000001
remind me of Malcolm in Midland

5112.38 --> 5121.32
you're obviously not that guy I think

5115.119 --> 5121.32
but that's where I didn't know that name

5121.849 --> 5128.360000000001
mmm-hmm I can't I can't I kind of do a

5125.4 --> 5134.58
boy I was not suspect yeah I broke it

5128.36 --> 5136.83
yeah it'll come back to me yeah well I

5134.58 --> 5140.2699999999995
want you touching on there about the

5136.83 --> 5143.01
Creator speaking things into the system

5140.27 --> 5146.55
well a creation itself

5143.01 --> 5150.84
it became yeah exactly you know I would

5146.55 --> 5153.4800000000005
say in the Quran yeah I like to rip into

5150.84 --> 5158.79
full Scripture okay that's it for

5153.48 --> 5161.459999999999
example you say in the beginning their

5158.79 --> 5166.349
world you know the Word was God

5161.46 --> 5168.4800000000005
you know it was with garden so in the

5166.349 --> 5172.5
Quran it says if the Creator only has to

5168.48 --> 5178.44
say it literally says the words say save

5172.5 --> 5183.23
me and it is so that goes exactly in

5178.44 --> 5190.5
line with what you're saying about

5183.23 --> 5195.089999999999
creation through sound so BN it is you

5190.5 --> 5198.239
know is this is the same thing when you

5195.09 --> 5200.76
ask me I need a crash this is this how

5198.239 --> 5202.348999999999
you want it is this what you want you

5200.76 --> 5206.429
know so you want then all I have to say

5202.349 --> 5210.360000000001
is be and it is you know and no it's not

5206.429 --> 5213.119
what I wanted you see so that's why it's

5210.36 --> 5216.8099999999995
too personal to me because if I didn't

5213.119 --> 5219.15
speak up and really let it out you know

5216.81 --> 5223.02
you couldn't be different there's no way

5219.15 --> 5225.9
to know but God willing

5223.02 --> 5231.119000000001
it's this way God willing I'm here

5225.9 --> 5236.449
talking to you and you know I I think

5231.119 --> 5241.049999999999
the biggest thing is that destroys

5236.449 --> 5244.0199999999995
getting any information and working out

5241.05 --> 5248.7300000000005
anything is the division of the people

5244.02 --> 5252.659000000001
you know and we just kind of went

5248.73 --> 5254.15
backwards where we had to you know live

5252.659 --> 5256.28
how I can do it

5254.15 --> 5258.19
and you know past the candle or you know

5256.28 --> 5260.69
what I mean and you ran out of candle

5258.19 --> 5263.33
kirisame then you've got no light for

5260.69 --> 5265.46
the night and you know these things we

5263.33 --> 5267.53
don't even think about and these things

5265.46 --> 5271.19
we don't even considered you know in the

5267.53 --> 5272.929
whole modern world right we live in

5271.19 --> 5275.54
boxes we live in

5272.929 --> 5278.9890000000005
almost human enclosures you know

5275.54 --> 5281.09
apartment blocks you know and things

5278.989 --> 5283.79
like this they're just they're all

5281.09 --> 5288.2300000000005
they're all they're necessary and you

5283.79 --> 5289.79
know we destroy rain forests you know we

5288.23 --> 5294.11
do all these different things and it's

5289.79 --> 5296.15
all for the production of what if

5294.11 --> 5299.75
there's no God and there's no meaning to

5296.15 --> 5302.8099999999995
life and in this life is the only time

5299.75 --> 5303.44
and point of life then who's at the

5302.81 --> 5307.1900000000005
front

5303.44 --> 5310.129999999999
who's winning you know who's closer to

5307.19 --> 5311.928999999999
the goal if this if the meaning of life

5310.13 --> 5315.650000000001
is in this life and the meaning of life

5311.929 --> 5318.29
is not because then ourselves you know

5315.65 --> 5322.759999999999
in creation doesn't stretch further into

5318.29 --> 5323.739
unknown realms in then why what is it

5322.76 --> 5330.26
all for

5323.739 --> 5332.509999999999
why why does the Atheist consider you

5330.26 --> 5335.9890000000005
know I heard this I heard this scenario

5332.51 --> 5340.13
and it's kind of prison why does an

5335.989 --> 5343.968999999999
atheist consider himself to a stone or

5340.13 --> 5345.679
even you know the food you know they're

5343.969 --> 5346.969
carbon and its carbon there's no meaning

5345.679 --> 5350.33
for anything when they're all just

5346.969 --> 5354.26
they're all the same but no here we are

5350.33 --> 5358.04
in a modern day time we've got things

5354.26 --> 5360.08
left behind like for example in in

5358.04 --> 5362.929
Lebanon and I don't know if you know

5360.08 --> 5365.989
this peanuts you mind that you might

5362.929 --> 5368.21
have heard of the temple Bell Vic have

5365.989 --> 5373.37
you heard of the temple Bell Vic I have

5368.21 --> 5375.14
know that name is new okay so this you

5373.37 --> 5376.969
know this is always like a an attempt Oh

5375.14 --> 5380.7390000000005
blah blah blah but just a few things

5376.969 --> 5385.349
about this temple the one it has tips

5380.739 --> 5387.989
that each tip weighs 1200 tons

5385.349 --> 5392.369000000001
and it's one piece of granite but one

5387.989 --> 5395.098999999999
piece of limestone this and another

5392.369 --> 5396.839999999999
stone I think it's 1800 tons it's like

5395.099 --> 5401.01
which cut in the ground it can't be

5396.84 --> 5405.78
moved by any enemy machinery in the

5401.01 --> 5409.159000000001
quarry we mix do the temple is a hundred

5405.78 --> 5412.73
and twenty six foot long obelisk

5409.159 --> 5415.739
unfinished lying down on its side

5412.73 --> 5419.28
because it was damaged in maybe Wars or

5415.739 --> 5422.25
fighting or something so it was but it's

5419.28 --> 5426.03
a hundred and twenty six foot long piece

5422.25 --> 5429.119
of rock just lifted there you know and

5426.03 --> 5431.13
we're just in it low and behold there's

5429.119 --> 5434.098999999999
Wars and all sorts of warring in Lebanon

5431.13 --> 5436.5
and you can't get there and you know the

5434.099 --> 5441.21
things that are left behind the the

5436.5 --> 5445.71
mysteries of the world and not not the

5441.21 --> 5451.32
ones that you know are in the in the

5445.71 --> 5453.3
main the main news I mean well you do

5451.32 --> 5456.75
yeah yeah alternative news

5453.3 --> 5460.9490000000005
sometimes exactly the main news is is is

5456.75 --> 5466.38
the is the one that you know always has

5460.949 --> 5470.369
you know which has the be hanging all

5466.38 --> 5477.75
the way to present it and for example

5470.369 --> 5481.409
you know Israel is one of the most holy

5477.75 --> 5484.59
places in the world because that's where

5481.409 --> 5487.17
Jesus is tomb what you know it has been

5484.59 --> 5492.3
discovered and under an apartment block

5487.17 --> 5494.25
you know you know coming like normally

5492.3 --> 5496.53
they check the things like underground

5494.25 --> 5498.719
before they build apartment blocks there

5496.53 --> 5500.55
was a lot of problems but they recently

5498.719 --> 5502.53
uncovered it using modern technology

5500.55 --> 5504.81
that they've found it but now here is

5502.53 --> 5507.38
Israel claiming that all other people

5504.81 --> 5510.119000000001
know not all it's all Jewish people

5507.38 --> 5512.31
everybody know means I might anti-semite

5510.119 --> 5516.32
I'm just stating facts

5512.31 --> 5521.21
yeah these

5516.32 --> 5524.268999999999
these this idea that they have the

5521.21 --> 5525.71
answer and they are the one you know

5524.269 --> 5526.849
there it's them and the chosen they're

5525.71 --> 5530.36
going to build the temple and all the

5526.849 --> 5534.889
rest of it yeah they fire upon children

5530.36 --> 5541.78
with weaponry and murder them daily you

5534.889 --> 5545.9890000000005
know and they have a serious amount of

5541.78 --> 5552.619
you know power against children who have

5545.989 --> 5554.539
nothing left and they battle and they

5552.619 --> 5557.15
and they and they hide and then they

5554.539 --> 5562.0
justify and they harden and then hear

5557.15 --> 5562.0
you harden them so they ha yeah exactly

5563.92 --> 5568.84
mirdon under ended off the people in

5566.75 --> 5572.0
Israel themselves because there's a lot

5568.84 --> 5575.2300000000005
Israelis that are just like we don't

5572.0 --> 5578.63
like this this is crazy

5575.23 --> 5581.75
exactly you know and I think I think you

5578.63 --> 5585.650000000001
need to if you're gonna unite the people

5581.75 --> 5588.76
and you're gonna get them to listen you

5585.65 --> 5594.768999999999
can't put it in lower than yourself you

5588.76 --> 5597.469
have to realize that no no person has

5594.769 --> 5600.05
the answer and completely answer about

5597.469 --> 5606.05
how we even have the consciousness that

5600.05 --> 5609.53
we have is that if therefore we we're

5606.05 --> 5613.849
all on an equal unknown basis you know

5609.53 --> 5616.639
starting the basis and so therefore we

5613.849 --> 5619.039
go through it and so the atheists will

5616.639 --> 5621.8
find one piece of Scripture and be like

5619.039 --> 5625.07
I got that's the reason why God doesn't

5621.8 --> 5628.070000000001
exist and then you move along the

5625.07 --> 5633.5
scriptures and you find if you actually

5628.07 --> 5638.38
gather them you know like that's you see

5633.5 --> 5641.0
you said about you know when you die and

5638.38 --> 5644.51
you stand before whatever created you

5641.0 --> 5647.03
whether it's God or energy you know in

5644.51 --> 5648.889
the in the oldest Hindu texts before

5647.03 --> 5649.639999999999
they slip through jealousy into their

5648.889 --> 5652.25
multiple go

5649.64 --> 5654.62
for everything there is no God God has

5652.25 --> 5657.04
no image there is no thought there is no

5654.62 --> 5659.36
picture that you can come up with

5657.04 --> 5664.0
because if you do then that's not God

5659.36 --> 5667.099999999999
you know right you Jesus Jesus El Cid

5664.0 --> 5669.14
it's all things that's why it's the

5667.1 --> 5673.490000000001
Alpha and Omega how can you personify

5669.14 --> 5676.6900000000005
that which is all things right exactly

5673.49 --> 5681.05
it makes no sense and Jesus said you

5676.69 --> 5684.11
know I am the father of one and he also

5681.05 --> 5685.7300000000005
said the father is greater than I and

5684.11 --> 5687.17
there is more than you know he just can

5685.73 --> 5690.19
be the whole Trinity saying and all the

5687.17 --> 5695.57
rest of it but it later on in the Quran

5690.19 --> 5701.629999999999
Jesus says you know in chapter 5 from

5695.57 --> 5705.08
116 to 118 he says he says if you knew

5701.63 --> 5706.46
you know if you knew and if it's not a

5705.08 --> 5711.5
hundred and if it's not the chapter five

5706.46 --> 5713.78
verse chapter 4 171 to 174 he says God

5711.5 --> 5715.58
asked him did you say they worship you

5713.78 --> 5718.099999999999
and your mother before me said no and if

5715.58 --> 5720.35
you did if I did you you know I would

5718.1 --> 5723.77
have said that and so that's what he

5720.35 --> 5725.870000000001
meant he clarified and that's what we

5723.77 --> 5728.570000000001
what do we do is he under your one God

5725.87 --> 5730.58
above all you know so and then and

5728.57 --> 5733.009999999999
there's the second chapter of the Quran

5730.58 --> 5736.67
again like it I told you as I read the

5733.01 --> 5739.820000000001
rest to you it brings it says oh there

5736.67 --> 5742.34
were all had they all had a meaning so

5739.82 --> 5745.04
chapter 5 verse 19 it says Christmas

5742.34 --> 5747.92
this message this message came so that

5745.04 --> 5752.36
you can say no misses came for you you

5747.92 --> 5754.85
know it's a whole process and if

5752.36 --> 5757.25
anything we'd be moved away from there

5754.85 --> 5759.43
on another look at this separation I

5757.25 --> 5761.03
think I can make separation

5759.43 --> 5763.64
compartmentalization the total

5761.03 --> 5765.92
separation of all things that's what

5763.64 --> 5770.33
they're trying because I've thought for

5765.92 --> 5774.9800000000005
a long time like the Elohim are the

5770.33 --> 5778.729
pantheon but they are the designation

5774.98 --> 5782.509999999999
they are the designated drivers or

5778.729 --> 5787.459
the forces the one force separated into

5782.51 --> 5790.400000000001
many it because that's the only way

5787.459 --> 5794.57
something that is all can interact with

5790.4 --> 5796.969
itself is by separating its yeah it's

5794.57 --> 5798.469
mystical in that sense but yeah you're

5796.969 --> 5808.249
you're giving me all kinds of

5798.469 --> 5811.28
inspiration I was just gonna say just

5808.249 --> 5816.159
kind of what he said about not force on

5811.28 --> 5822.259999999999
a fight a any type of image in your head

5816.159 --> 5824.03
and I I wanted to ask y'all you know I

5822.26 --> 5827.619000000001
know where I know Arlen has to round out

5824.03 --> 5827.619
here shortly because the show is always

5828.13 --> 5838.639
real quickly the D phrase as above so

5834.739 --> 5843.409
below that that the definition of that

5838.639 --> 5847.209
it keeps changing as I'm either maturing

5843.409 --> 5849.799999999999
or whatever I'm going through I keep I

5847.209 --> 5853.119
keep rounding it off I keep I keep

5849.8 --> 5856.01
changing right so just real quickly I

5853.119 --> 5858.799999999999
want to know what that phrase means to

5856.01 --> 5861.17
you guys where the time well what

5858.8 --> 5863.03
doesn't it mean oh by the way thanks

5861.17 --> 5865.459
tell me what it means to you you know I

5863.03 --> 5867.978999999999
don't know what it means to you first I

5865.459 --> 5869.539
want to thank over Mukul for donating $2

5867.979 --> 5874.070000000001
to my super chat thank you very much

5869.539 --> 5880.999
over mobile as above so below

5874.07 --> 5884.989
I think it has to do with scaling it's

5880.999 --> 5889.01
the microcosm macrocosm thing it just

5884.989 --> 5893.808999999999
implies to me that the structure of all

5889.01 --> 5897.4400000000005
things work all the same on every scale

5893.809 --> 5901.779
it is the pattern it is like a giant

5897.44 --> 5905.098999999999
fractal from the absolute all too

5901.779 --> 5908.709000000001
the absolute separated micro

5905.099 --> 5910.779
miniaturized thing until it cannot be

5908.709 --> 5914.3189999999995
separated further I think that's what it

5910.779 --> 5915.819
refers to but there's many other levels

5914.319 --> 5919.659000000001
to approach it this one is pretty

5915.819 --> 5924.069
extreme so I think it references it was

5919.659 --> 5926.919
a de fractal nature of it all I think

5924.069 --> 5929.439
away III I was gonna say something

5926.919 --> 5932.559
similar I was saying that if we're in

5929.439 --> 5937.809
the mid of like say for example if we're

5932.559 --> 5943.029
in the middle of a of a scale did you

5937.809 --> 5948.249
say we start from subatomic particles

5943.029 --> 5952.029
then the atoms into this the minerals

5948.249 --> 5954.8189999999995
yeah and then to the plants and then to

5952.029 --> 5959.619000000001
the animals and then there's us and then

5954.819 --> 5962.799
these angels and then this God so all

5959.619 --> 5964.629
those things sustain each other so the

5962.799 --> 5966.009
subatomic particles create the atoms

5964.629 --> 5967.659
which makes us Dickstein you know

5966.009 --> 5969.779
minerals which makes the plants which

5967.659 --> 5972.2789999999995
should be the animals which then feed us

5969.779 --> 5977.6990000000005
and then give us the ability to think

5972.279 --> 5985.179
and in right and the next thing that we

5977.699 --> 5987.339
we pass our best intentions to be you

5985.179 --> 5989.919
know the Grand Master's of our our own

5987.339 --> 5992.859
self and those who pass on may even get

5989.919 --> 5996.999
to be and at the top this God and so we

5992.859 --> 5999.6990000000005
could give our reverence to them pass

5996.999 --> 6002.519
God but they are at a higher

5999.699 --> 6004.409
consciousness level in us the animal

6002.519 --> 6006.509
there's a lower consciousness level as

6004.409 --> 6008.489
the plant has a consciousness little

6006.509 --> 6011.159
like you know that's why there's a

6008.489 --> 6013.558999999999
symbiotic nature which they was to be

6011.159 --> 6018.659
and the flower so that's what it means

6013.559 --> 6022.549
to me you know that's cool man that's

6018.659 --> 6023.69
really yours is a lot better than mine

6022.549 --> 6028.49
what

6023.69 --> 6032.71
your interpretation I I'm starting to

6028.49 --> 6035.92
kind of wonder if if what what we see

6032.71 --> 6038.69
the lights in the sky reflects

6035.92 --> 6042.47
consciousness here on earth and however

6038.69 --> 6045.2
it is your honor know is what we see in

6042.47 --> 6048.320000000001
the Stars that is fascinating concept I

6045.2 --> 6051.74
thought of that before especially if

6048.32 --> 6054.38
yeah if we go into weird rectangular

6051.74 --> 6057.59
looping thingies and holographic skies

6054.38 --> 6061.82
and yeah if we can't actually pinpoint

6057.59 --> 6066.74
the origin of what causes the globe of

6061.82 --> 6071.049999999999
the heavens holographic phenomena you

6066.74 --> 6076.01
may be right it may be some kind of

6071.05 --> 6078.71
mirror reflection of the world but maybe

6076.01 --> 6081.83
not in a physical literal time-bound

6078.71 --> 6087.32
sense but more like an ethereal map of

6081.83 --> 6092.03
all existence that we just get see all

6087.32 --> 6094.7
the time maybe that's why the

6092.03 --> 6097.849999999999
astrologers and everything can actually

6094.7 --> 6101.03
read read them and predict things

6097.85 --> 6104.450000000001
because that is what it is because it is

6101.03 --> 6110.12
a giant ethereal reflection of all

6104.45 --> 6113.03
creation throughout time somehow I've

6110.12 --> 6116.72
always wondered you know because a a

6113.03 --> 6119.17
woman is can can experience something

6116.72 --> 6123.38
that that us3 will never experience

6119.17 --> 6125.72
right with a child and I've always

6123.38 --> 6128.33
wondered you know what if it's the set

6125.72 --> 6131.54
of this earth being controlled by you

6128.33 --> 6135.14
know men Brotherhood for Freemasons

6131.54 --> 6138.56
whatever imagine if this earth was was

6135.14 --> 6142.280000000001
ran by women right first of all there

6138.56 --> 6144.200000000001
would be pillows everywhere yeah and I

6142.28 --> 6149.929999999999
just wondered if

6144.2 --> 6152.42
chokolate factories right if we was

6149.93 --> 6157.13
brands on women and women made the

6152.42 --> 6158.99
decisions imagine what our sky

6157.13 --> 6160.58
look like an imagine how bright and

6158.99 --> 6163.3
beautiful it would be and that's what

6160.58 --> 6167.44
has above so below means to me

6163.3 --> 6172.64
maybe maybe because what what I see Mars

6167.44 --> 6174.049999999999
it's so red it's blood red and I've

6172.64 --> 6175.88
never seen it like that of course I've

6174.05 --> 6179.33
only been paying attention for the last

6175.88 --> 6183.17
four years but when I look at Mars it's

6179.33 --> 6184.91
just it's a dead red I disagree I

6183.17 --> 6189.29
thought it was always kind of more

6184.91 --> 6194.86
orange II more or maybe orange

6189.29 --> 6198.98
ochre like not really red not the real

6194.86 --> 6205.04
literal RGB red but more like a bit

6198.98 --> 6206.839999999999
orangey reddish do you know do you know

6205.04 --> 6207.38
what what kind of led me to think that

6206.84 --> 6211.400000000001
way

6207.38 --> 6217.43
sorry do you know what led me to think

6211.4 --> 6219.95
that way okay because because it seems

6217.43 --> 6226.06
like you can only see the stars from the

6219.95 --> 6226.0599999999995
earth yeah yeah yeah yeah so so to me

6226.75 --> 6232.37
they could possibly be reflecting what

6229.82 --> 6233.8099999999995
is happening on earth and that's just

6232.37 --> 6234.8
the way I think of it I know you gotta

6233.81 --> 6237.4400000000005
go

6234.8 --> 6241.16
yeah I'm most sorry to see this go cuz

6237.44 --> 6242.87
like I started up pretty shitty mood and

6241.16 --> 6247.19
now it's really good and interesting and

6242.87 --> 6249.74
no really now I have to go but yeah I

6247.19 --> 6253.73
should probably run out to show almost

6249.74 --> 6254.42
we should continue it maybe we can't

6253.73 --> 6256.5199999999995
tomorrow

6254.42 --> 6258.08
maybe you guys want to get back on and

6256.52 --> 6261.080000000001
kind of try to continue this

6258.08 --> 6264.5
conversation if your hearts and your

6261.08 --> 6266.75
minor are still in there I never want to

6264.5 --> 6270.29
encroach on your show you know and then

6266.75 --> 6273.11
never want to I never want to you know

6270.29 --> 6274.64
be be on your show and you just feel

6273.11 --> 6276.38
compelled to have me on the show because

6274.64 --> 6279.08
you know you're such a kind person

6276.38 --> 6280.25
I won't even want to be invited so you

6279.08 --> 6282.38
know if you want me back on the show

6280.25 --> 6286.73
make time for you let's have all this

6282.38 --> 6288.05
all right no I hear of an incredibly

6286.73 --> 6291.0199999999995
valuable contrary

6288.05 --> 6295.7
Oshin every time you're on although yeah

6291.02 --> 6297.68
I have personal moods reflections

6295.7 --> 6300.71
sometimes but yeah they are all over the

6297.68 --> 6304.25
place like I can hate people equally as

6300.71 --> 6307.43
much as I love them it's all a matter of

6304.25 --> 6311.18
on which side of the mirrors do I seem

6307.43 --> 6312.83
to be at the time and at first I was

6311.18 --> 6316.01
like are you again

6312.83 --> 6320.09
but that was my response to absolutely

6316.01 --> 6322.79
everything and and you kind of woke me

6320.09 --> 6327.52
up out of that and now I'm really really

6322.79 --> 6327.5199999999995
glad that you came so thank you so much

6331.72 --> 6338.87
how random topics come up and I get to

6336.05 --> 6344.570000000001
kind of explore those topics that aren't

6338.87 --> 6346.67
always talked about but you know man we

6344.57 --> 6348.5599999999995
didn't even give him any ID any indicate

6346.67 --> 6353.77
an indication that you were you know

6348.56 --> 6356.0
you're upset but you know I did today

6353.77 --> 6358.22
just a little just a little bit about

6356.0 --> 6360.23
the browser you know before you started

6358.22 --> 6365.240000000001
to shower oh you know it may be that's

6360.23 --> 6367.639999999999
fine but well did I miss the part after

6365.24 --> 6370.969999999999
that because I was like rambling on like

6367.64 --> 6374.75
a crazy pessimist for like ten minutes

6370.97 --> 6378.2
or something or 15 but maybe you just

6374.75 --> 6382.51
look past it because probably what

6378.2 --> 6386.21
everyone should do I feel in retrospect

6382.51 --> 6388.67
it is what it is but it's good thank you

6386.21 --> 6390.68
good we all go through those okay yep I

6388.67 --> 6395.57
guess we do and I guess it was meant to

6390.68 --> 6401.240000000001
be just that every time I get in that

6395.57 --> 6403.639999999999
position it has this convincing element

6401.24 --> 6405.5199999999995
to the feelings that just tell you yeah

6403.64 --> 6409.88
this is forever

6405.52 --> 6411.2300000000005
it's crazy how that works those are the

6409.88 --> 6413.33
negative thoughts those are the ones

6411.23 --> 6416.089999999999
that I told you do you think you have

6413.33 --> 6419.62
control over but

6416.09 --> 6423.92
your thoughts yeah those are situations

6419.62 --> 6426.62
alouicious illusions exactly exactly and

6423.92 --> 6429.95
this is negative it was pretty look it

6426.62 --> 6432.22
might have absolutely if I call my

6429.95 --> 6435.98
healer I get the chance

6432.22 --> 6438.2

6435.98 --> 6440.54
tell me yep that was Irie man

6438.2 --> 6443.45
every man got to you because that is

6440.54 --> 6446.06

6449.3 --> 6454.37

the light was didn't expect this what

6537.53 --> 6542.33
happened at all

6539.32 --> 6545.78
although yeah I should probably know

6542.33 --> 6548.13
better than to not expect this kind of

6545.78 --> 6551.82
thing to happen
