am not wearing a shirt it's too freakin

73.64 --> 85.25
hot it's pure blue sky no clouds this

81.59 --> 88.399
time there is some wind but like even

85.25 --> 93.399
the wind is just warm so it'll probably

88.399 --> 96.89
be a lot nicer in the evening but yeah

93.399 --> 107.709
it's just it just pretty much became

96.89 --> 112.55
survivable here because yeah it just

107.709 --> 119.03
stopped hitting my window just now it

112.55 --> 120.649
really happens to a clock stat so but

119.03 --> 123.83
yeah it's a hot day there's a lot of

120.649 --> 127.67
people in boats and just splashing

123.83 --> 129.47
around at the river it's so hot that

127.67 --> 131.3
there's not even a lot of people walking

129.47 --> 133.489
around because it's just too warm and

131.3 --> 143.39000000000001
like the street is radiating all this

133.489 --> 145.56900000000002
heat so yeah I have a foot bath today

143.39 --> 148.22
also

145.569 --> 151.42999999999998
on the recommendation of some want

148.22 --> 155.45
somebody in chat yesterday it's really

151.43 --> 158.9
nice actually so thanks for the tip yeah

155.45 --> 163.36999999999998
it's really easy to do that yeah I do

158.9 --> 167.239
live very near a river it's yeah right

163.37 --> 168.65
next to it like my street the vet plants

167.239 --> 172.44
um the vet

168.65 --> 174.59900000000002
fight named in Dutch is actually the

172.44 --> 178.67
name of the river that that that's gone

174.599 --> 184.56
right through Utrecht and I'm next to it

178.67 --> 188.67
anyway but I'm not swimming in there by

184.56 --> 192.51
the way you know that maybe at one point

188.67 --> 198.42
I will I don't know but yeah it's not my

192.51 --> 200.39999999999998
type of water all right so anyway I got

198.42 --> 203.39999999999998
no green tea with me today because I

200.4 --> 206.64000000000001
noticed this morning like hey that's my

203.4 --> 209.34
green tea what I literally didn't drink

206.64 --> 211.67999999999998
any of it it's just too damn warm

209.34 --> 214.489
yesterday I had like one cup and that

211.68 --> 219.53
was it so I'm not gonna waste another

214.489 --> 224.0
teabag on that but I did get another big

219.53 --> 224.0
big glass of grapefruit juice

226.959 --> 234.189
oh I guess I really hit the spot

230.349 --> 241.689
yesterday and I got a bottle of cold

234.189 --> 245.98
water then I put it in the cooler so

241.689 --> 250.85899999999998
yeah I got plenty of refreshments for my

245.98 --> 256.37899999999996
feet and for my stomach

250.859 --> 256.379
let's see who's in chat this Friday

257.16 --> 261.82000000000005
would be surprised if this turns out to

259.72 --> 267.15000000000003
be the hottest Friday in the Netherlands

261.82 --> 271.99
of this year right so a DM was first

267.15 --> 274.88899999999995
gaining wisdom and a young good servant

271.99 --> 274.889
Missouri bear

275.43 --> 284.46
dank Robin Stanley

279.09 --> 284.46
Sarita Cosentino we have

285.82 --> 289.98
and the mighty Nigel

291.61 --> 297.47900000000004
- it's racist flag okey-dokey

297.84 --> 303.659
that particular fan of that but sure

305.789 --> 313.71
gideon sick yeah good to see you all

318.659 --> 329.5
yeah i'm still sort of skinny I'm really

326.83 --> 332.139
not that skinny why well I am kinda

329.5 --> 337.27
skinny I guess but it used to be a lot

332.139 --> 341.31
worse I couldn't make my stomach crawl

337.27 --> 344.43899999999996
in like it would look kind of creepy so

341.31 --> 346.469
I have to make some real effort to do

344.439 --> 346.469
that

352.51 --> 355.2
all right

356.1 --> 362.69
so ya just realized that at the same

358.92 --> 365.7
time over in Australia and New Zealand

362.69 --> 372.36
it's really cold probably maybe even

365.7 --> 376.28999999999996
snowing how about that how weird is that

372.36 --> 378.15000000000003
I still have trouble like I brought it

376.29 --> 381.45000000000005
up remember was it on the show yesterday

378.15 --> 384.5
or the day before about the seasons and

381.45 --> 387.97999999999996
how basically in the same realm confined

384.5 --> 390.98
in one location there's a lot of heat

387.98 --> 394.74
for all the consequences of that and

390.98 --> 397.82
then on another side it's extremely cold

394.74 --> 401.26
with the yeah this is the opposite and

397.82 --> 404.399
everything looks completely different I

401.26 --> 404.399
[Music]

405.11 --> 417.38
have I find that very odd just surreal

411.59 --> 422.58
you know before before I knew there was

417.38 --> 425.96999999999997
south of the Equator as well I like God

422.58 --> 428.96999999999997
really freaked out by the idea that

425.97 --> 431.58000000000004
there was the opposite season supposedly

428.97 --> 433.83000000000004
on the other side it really freaked me

431.58 --> 436.74
out when I first heard that like really

433.83 --> 446.4
like that doesn't make any damn sense to

436.74 --> 450.18
me intuitively because I don't know hot

446.4 --> 456.46999999999997
flows the cold so why isn't the heat

450.18 --> 456.47
basically melting the cold in the south

457.28 --> 464.28
how can it cool off so much over the

461.73 --> 466.41
distance in order to over there

464.28 --> 470.07
literally just freeze up I just don't

466.41 --> 473.66
understand I don't understand how that

470.07 --> 473.65999999999997
can persist for such a long time

474.3 --> 488.11
it's indirect open contact there's no

477.19 --> 490.45
barrier in between guys anyway probably

488.11 --> 493.0
a little bit too surreal for us to even

490.45 --> 494.59
realize how surreal that is you know

493.0 --> 497.74
some things in this realm were just so

494.59 --> 500.26
complicated we'd rather just say no I

497.74 --> 502.33
don't see why that's why that's weird

500.26 --> 504.09999999999997
because they just can't handle thinking

502.33 --> 513.22
about that it might actually be very

504.1 --> 515.5600000000001
freaking weird yeah but with the season

513.22 --> 517.45
situation really it doesn't even matter

515.56 --> 519.64
what the Sun is whether it's an object

517.45 --> 522.76
or whether it's this supposed ball of

519.64 --> 526.42
heat close by or very far away it

522.76 --> 530.56
doesn't really matter to me in that con

526.42 --> 533.2199999999999
in that context it it still just totally

530.56 --> 533.2199999999999
surreal to me

542.51 --> 545.6
[Music]

558.019 --> 564.41
hmm

560.54 --> 566.66
okay Missouri bear I see that you're

564.41 --> 575.8389999999999
gonna go with another Black Swan photo

566.66 --> 578.56
all the flat horizons a bummer clap

575.839 --> 578.5600000000001
Gator fish

589.03 --> 597.65
right so anyway was i doing yesterday

595.82 --> 600.98
yeah there was a flat earth debate very

597.65 --> 603.1999999999999
alone and it was very good and it wasn't

600.98 --> 606.5600000000001
even part the whole tided I wasn't even

603.2 --> 609.4300000000001
there present during the show the whole

606.56 --> 612.92
time got some groceries in between and

609.43 --> 615.14
yeah when I listen back to it when it

612.92 --> 617.9
was played in the evening up to pretty

615.14 --> 619.34
late it was really good and even the

617.9 --> 621.64
parts I wasn't there was just really

619.34 --> 621.64
good

629.42 --> 634.67
so you had a good time that show it's

632.18 --> 638.0799999999999
very active and I hope to get another

634.67 --> 638.0799999999999
show like this today as well

642.29 --> 648.4889999999999
because they will of course echo um in

645.41 --> 648.4889999999999
the weekend

649.809 --> 654.639
yeah misery Barris a pretty decent

652.22 --> 654.639
picture

654.98 --> 658.239
[Music]

685.65 --> 690.0799999999999
yeah yeah yeah but doesn't really matter

702.23 --> 715.74
right hmm so oh yeah that I continued

713.19 --> 717.21
watching dark kidding I think I'm

715.74 --> 718.89
nearing the end of the second season

717.21 --> 719.57
it's probably gonna end there or

718.89 --> 726.6
something

719.57 --> 735.57
that series is just crazy like I'm gonna

726.6 --> 738.63
nickname it like time incest maybe a bit

735.57 --> 740.5200000000001
too much but yeah people that watched it

738.63 --> 747.21
will probably get that like oh come on

740.52 --> 749.88
really like stay off like don't be

747.21 --> 752.58
attracted with that girl you don't know

749.88 --> 754.67
yet because she will turn out to be your

752.58 --> 756.44
mother

754.67 --> 764.01
[Music]

756.44 --> 770.2800000000001
that's Oh God like it gets kind of out

764.01 --> 773.25
of hand at some point yeah but still

770.28 --> 775.8199999999999
think it is a pretty fascinating series

773.25 --> 775.82
overall

794.66 --> 800.37
no but there's various sounds like

797.34 --> 802.4100000000001
really surreal like pretty surreal and

800.37 --> 804.26
depressing in a way drama in there in

802.41 --> 809.28
the sense that the people are like yeah

804.26 --> 812.37
I'm gonna have to like hey Dad I'm gonna

809.28 --> 814.9499999999999
have to do this which will mean that I

812.37 --> 820.92
will never have existed but we have to

814.95 --> 825.35
do this that got like really yeah time

820.92 --> 828.2099999999999
travel overkill Krystal drama situation

825.35 --> 829.71
it's kind of the first thing the first

828.21 --> 834.02
time I've ever seen that in the series

829.71 --> 834.02
done halfway decent really

845.88 --> 852.46
alright by the way doesn't what do you

848.11 --> 856.84
know which star was just blazing last

852.46 --> 858.82
night blazing was so right that it

856.84 --> 861.69
didn't even look like a star to me it

858.82 --> 865.9200000000001
just looked like this this blob of light

861.69 --> 871.12
it's almost like dancing it's crazy

865.92 --> 873.4
what's that Venus probably was there was

871.12 --> 875.62
that one and another one that was at a

873.4 --> 878.29
not too far away from it and they were

875.62 --> 880.15
like well the the bright one was just

878.29 --> 883.18
really bright but both of them kept

880.15 --> 892.75
visible the entire night really bright

883.18 --> 894.6999999999999
and yeah by the way once I started

892.75 --> 898.96
noticing that I was already kind of like

894.7 --> 904.2700000000001
yeah I'm gonna sleep it was just freakin

898.96 --> 908.08
on I've actually just literally slept on

904.27 --> 910.06
the balcony apart like in the very late

908.08 --> 912.3100000000001
evening just put my cushion on there and

910.06 --> 916.78
just lay just on the balcony just like

912.31 --> 921.2099999999999
that because the wind and it was no more

916.78 --> 921.2099999999999
Sun I know that yeah that was amazing

941.1 --> 949.19
because somewhere he comes at night

950.32 --> 959.38
so was it there was it Fitness Missouri

954.459 --> 961.959
where like in the night it was over

959.38 --> 964.35
there so it was pretty much roughly in

961.959 --> 964.3499999999999
the south

967.04 --> 980.259
I saw it mostly in the south and I think

977.149 --> 984.31
it was already pretty far away from

980.259 --> 984.3100000000001
where the Sun comes up

991.48 --> 1000.48
no I don't have air-conditioner Gideon

994.16 --> 1000.48
sig would work here anyway

1000.93 --> 1006.6389999999999
and beside like after two it's okay it's

1004.42 --> 1009.2199999999999
really up until two o'clock in the

1006.639 --> 1013.149
afternoon that I'm just cooking here

1009.22 --> 1016.869
that's why I prefer to don't go to bed

1013.149 --> 1021.119
too late during this summer and then go

1016.869 --> 1021.119
out like do my groceries in the morning

1024.27 --> 1029.9189999999999
because like in the morning sitting just

1027.309 --> 1031.449
here behind the computer is not fun but

1029.919 --> 1038.8600000000001
just sitting there it just makes me

1031.449 --> 1041.319
sweat constantly Europeans do not

1038.86 --> 1045.25
believe in air condition well I would

1041.319 --> 1048.85
believe in it if I'd have a place for it

1045.25 --> 1052.95
it's just one silly little room I don't

1048.85 --> 1052.9499999999998
have a proper place to put it in

1062.96 --> 1068.1190000000001
and besides if you have a big enough

1064.999 --> 1070.7
house there's always going to be a part

1068.119 --> 1072.139
where it's cooler because it's in the

1070.7 --> 1075.169
opposite side of where the Sun is

1072.139 --> 1077.5089999999998
heating you know so that that works good

1075.169 --> 1079.009
enough I don't have that luxury to

1077.509 --> 1080.99
maneuver to the other side of the

1079.009 --> 1089.779
building just like that because it's not

1080.99 --> 1093.6490000000001
my room they would let me install well

1089.779 --> 1097.249
not if it's like if it's a removable one

1093.649 --> 1099.7399999999998
not if I'm going to alter like the wall

1097.249 --> 1102.8890000000001
or something no there's no way that the

1099.74 --> 1105.049
landlord would allow that and yeah it

1102.889 --> 1115.7299999999998
would cost him more electricity which he

1105.049 --> 1119.899
would not like at all so Wow I got a

1115.73 --> 1123.73
feet bath and it's really cool so who

1119.899 --> 1127.029
needs an Erica when you got just water

1123.73 --> 1127.029
in a container

1140.62 --> 1149.1499999999999
no that's not an aerco getting sick

1144.23 --> 1152.02
that's an air filter the air filter is

1149.15 --> 1154.22
broken it was never an air-conditioner

1152.02 --> 1156.37
doesn't change the temperature of the

1154.22 --> 1156.3700000000001
air

1170.58 --> 1176.28
nope it's not gonna happen there's not

1174.3 --> 1178.44
gonna be an air conditioner on this show

1176.28 --> 1182.25
ever it's just not gonna happen

1178.44 --> 1184.5900000000001
not here in this building so you can

1182.25 --> 1185.57
stop talking about it now it's not gonna

1184.59 --> 1188.57
happen

1185.57 --> 1188.57
mm-hmm

1201.11 --> 1208.85
right Kevin yep painted white and they

1204.41 --> 1212.63
have very like traditional cellar

1208.85 --> 1215.33
systems it's a very important way to

1212.63 --> 1219.89
keep things cool and if they were really

1215.33 --> 1223.34
well designed then they even use the

1219.89 --> 1226.13
natural cold from the cellar within like

1223.34 --> 1231.32
a circulatory system to keep the place

1226.13 --> 1234.25
cool without having to require a lot of

1231.32 --> 1234.25
air conditioner

1238.39 --> 1245.44
like when they draw the air through a

1242.44 --> 1247.89
bigger basement with a lot of room where

1245.44 --> 1247.89
it's cool

1264.12 --> 1269.82
yeah well that's really nice Missouri

1266.46 --> 1273.779
bear that's great yeah I would like a

1269.82 --> 1277.4089999999999
house too yeah maybe a garden maybe a

1273.779 --> 1282.929
room to do my goldsmithing maybe a room

1277.409 --> 1286.6200000000001
to have a proper freakin bed yeah that

1282.929 --> 1288.6000000000001
would be really great lovely yeah and

1286.62 --> 1289.9189999999999
when I got all that then yeah maybe then

1288.6 --> 1293.4289999999999
I would consider getting an air

1289.919 --> 1295.64
conditioner yeah that's just freaking

1293.429 --> 1295.64
great

1305.2 --> 1308.349
[Music]

1341.22 --> 1346.38
I don't know Missouri bear I doubt it I

1344.1 --> 1348.75
think our conditioner probably has

1346.38 --> 1350.88
contributed to more health problem here

1348.75 --> 1356.7
than you health problems then you

1350.88 --> 1360.48
realize even back in the day it's known

1356.7 --> 1363.75
that just it radically changes the

1360.48 --> 1367.83
temperature and especially when you stay

1363.75 --> 1372.45
in that then you go out and the heat

1367.83 --> 1374.85
it's really bad for you like it can get

1372.45 --> 1378.3300000000002
you act actually get you sick

1374.85 --> 1381.3799999999999
so yeah no air conditioner is not really

1378.33 --> 1384.03
that freakin good it's only good if

1381.38 --> 1386.3090000000002
you're an American and you think you

1384.03 --> 1387.809
can't live without one because everybody

1386.309 --> 1390.059
taught you you have to have an air

1387.809 --> 1396.78
conditioner on your head to survive as a

1390.059 --> 1400.85
species this is or you could just have a

1396.78 --> 1400.85
cool place to sit in the shade you know

1401.6 --> 1404.6
sorry

1427.2 --> 1435.1200000000001
write it in sick that's right and also

1430.26 --> 1437.91
very important very very important that

1435.12 --> 1440.61
you take in enough minerals because the

1437.91 --> 1443.67
more fluid are gonna pass through you

1440.61 --> 1447.03
because of sweating and [ __ ] and yeah

1443.67 --> 1449.13
the more minerals are gonna come out

1447.03 --> 1451.83
with that sweat and I'll bet that most

1449.13 --> 1453.3600000000001
of you will take regular showers just to

1451.83 --> 1456.87
cool off well every time you do that

1453.36 --> 1462.27
another layer of minerals is extracted

1456.87 --> 1465.8999999999999
from your body and removed and when it's

1462.27 --> 1471.3899999999999
hot those minerals actually form a

1465.9 --> 1474.3300000000002
physical provable protection against

1471.39 --> 1477.15
well the Sun for starters it does that

1474.33 --> 1478.62
it's in there's in nature there's other

1477.15 --> 1481.77
creatures that have it much more

1478.62 --> 1483.33
pronounced like say hippos they actually

1481.77 --> 1485.7
just sweat out that stuff and it's

1483.33 --> 1488.79
literally just the natural sun

1485.7 --> 1491.04
protection well I think that the most

1488.79 --> 1493.95
animals have that to some degree and I

1491.04 --> 1498.02
think humans are among those so be

1493.95 --> 1502.2
careful if you're gonna shower a lot

1498.02 --> 1506.52
make sure you also drink enough water

1502.2 --> 1510.45
with I know what I do is make sure to

1506.52 --> 1514.68
get some some salt some natural crystal

1510.45 --> 1520.5900000000001
salts not refined so I take Himalayan

1514.68 --> 1525.54
salt you could use other types make sure

1520.59 --> 1527.22
you get that in your system as well even

1525.54 --> 1529.71
though you would think it would make you

1527.22 --> 1532.79
very thirsty it actually helps you

1529.71 --> 1536.01
retain some of the water in your system

1532.79 --> 1539.18
so they so don't that you don't sweat it

1536.01 --> 1542.64
out as quickly and it helps basically

1539.18 --> 1545.1200000000001
eject this protection layer over time on

1542.64 --> 1545.1200000000001
your skin

1562.72 --> 1565.5
hmm

1570.91 --> 1574.3500000000001
okay a gym

1577.05 --> 1584.97
well I think I think that only really

1579.72 --> 1587.43
works in winter that type of thing is

1584.97 --> 1589.92
done typically in cold regions take a

1587.43 --> 1592.53
very hot bath or a sauna and then just

1589.92 --> 1596.0700000000002
go out and just literally dive in the

1592.53 --> 1597.69
snow that's how they do it over there

1596.07 --> 1599.3999999999999
because if you do this it is if you take

1597.69 --> 1602.22
a freaking hot bath during the summer

1599.4 --> 1608.3700000000001
dude you might just go

1602.22 --> 1610.8500000000001
you might just die yeah that's

1608.37 --> 1615.1699999999998
potentially dangerous I wouldn't do it

1610.85 --> 1615.1699999999998
but in a winter that's something else

1617.84 --> 1622.1699999999998
however really cold showers yeah

1621.03 --> 1624.66
everybody

1622.17 --> 1627.51
nobody's gonna really object to it as

1624.66 --> 1630.2
much as normal as much as during the

1627.51 --> 1630.2
other seasons

1639.75 --> 1642.62
hmm

1645.7 --> 1653.829
yes atm I've yeah I've heard that it is

1651.009 --> 1657.159
used for the therapies with opioid

1653.829 --> 1659.399
related addictions including alcohol by

1657.159 --> 1659.3990000000001
the way

1676.34 --> 1688.76
right so this is this is all great what

1687.5 --> 1691.57
do you want to talk some flat earth

1688.76 --> 1691.57
maybe

1710.29 --> 1716.37
no I didn't hear that in sorry bear did

1713.5 --> 1716.37
he go at it again

1717.21 --> 1722.04
it's my tune all right

1726.33 --> 1736.08
what's new Gideon sick uh I don't know

1731.129 --> 1739.799
what's really new yeah you can't really

1736.08 --> 1746.4589999999998
say what's new anymore because it's it's

1739.799 --> 1750.179
just a several tier awakening process

1746.459 --> 1752.219
happening measurably like measurably

1750.179 --> 1754.6490000000001
awakening you can see that there is

1752.219 --> 1757.259
literal progress and I could see like

1754.649 --> 1761.039
even going around the Alex Jones channel

1757.259 --> 1763.95
still they had some weird thingy majiggy

1761.039 --> 1766.709
with Kuro knew that they were almost

1763.95 --> 1769.979
kind of like yeah it's real and I

1766.709 --> 1772.6190000000001
remember well it's all just getting

1769.979 --> 1777.3790000000001
ahead and I'm especially starting to

1772.619 --> 1780.509
notice that that what I said earlier

1777.379 --> 1784.1689999999999
everybody's getting sick of it like

1780.509 --> 1787.919
mentally getting sick of it that seems

1784.169 --> 1790.909
to be echoing now to the to the max like

1787.919 --> 1796.039
I didn't expect it to be this pronounced

1790.909 --> 1796.0390000000002
but like everybody's done with it and

1797.209 --> 1808.009
that's good I think on the other hand it

1802.109 --> 1812.1899999999998
doesn't seem like there is a response to

1808.009 --> 1815.549
that rejection and that's something that

1812.19 --> 1819.1490000000001
does kind of worry me like it's almost

1815.549 --> 1822.539
like it doesn't matter they're still

1819.149 --> 1825.2689999999998
gonna keep the playbook going whether we

1822.539 --> 1827.009
go along with it or whether we all start

1825.269 --> 1831.469
to reject it that's the weird feeling

1827.009 --> 1833.999
I'm getting like to have to play it out

1831.469 --> 1837.929
are there more flat-earthers that alex

1833.999 --> 1840.2
jones sort of maybe I do get hints of it

1837.929 --> 1840.2
sometimes

1849.34 --> 1855.48
oh yeah that one thing that was a little

1852.759 --> 1859.6
weird just a snippet you know it's it's

1855.48 --> 1863.1390000000001
absolutely 100% your attention-grabbing

1859.6 --> 1865.299
us but I think that Alex Jones I don't

1863.139 --> 1867.4599999999998
know maybe accidentally at one point but

1865.299 --> 1869.559
he kept it in a freaking advertisement

1867.46 --> 1873.039
play so it keeps on playing he makes a

1869.559 --> 1875.1689999999999
hint at the firmament were they saying

1873.039 --> 1876.999
and then he realized like Oh what the

1875.169 --> 1882.159
[ __ ] did I just say and then the clip

1876.999 --> 1886.84
cuts talks about like why birds hit

1882.159 --> 1889.6290000000001
their heads in the blue sky yeah weird

1886.84 --> 1896.9499999999998
saying but it's like yeah why would a

1889.629 --> 1899.59
bird hit their head in the sky right I

1896.95 --> 1902.74
don't know but this is just completely

1899.59 --> 1905.259
not important at this point he's

1902.74 --> 1907.48
probably just regretting that he didn't

1905.259 --> 1910.48
just brutally step on the flat earth

1907.48 --> 1913.24
bandwagon because it's yeah the ballers

1910.48 --> 1916.3600000000001
are just running down they're getting

1913.24 --> 1918.94
more psychologically associated with the

1916.36 --> 1921.9399999999998
Liberals because of these synchronicity

1918.94 --> 1924.759
and tactics even though many ballers are

1921.94 --> 1927.1000000000001
still adamantly opposed to liberals of

1924.759 --> 1928.99
course but just because of their

1927.1 --> 1931.6789999999999
techniques because of the method because

1928.99 --> 1935.409
of the way they wield propaganda and

1931.679 --> 1938.47
distractions they're becoming on the

1935.409 --> 1941.529
same frequency whether that be by

1938.47 --> 1943.869
accident or by pre-engineered social

1941.529 --> 1948.759
engineer design seem to be getting

1943.869 --> 1952.2099999999998
closer so there's just not a lot of good

1948.759 --> 1954.869
in being on it on the baller side

1952.21 --> 1954.8690000000001
anymore

1956.039 --> 1962.71
see

1958.99 --> 1964.45
I don't hear Alex Jones talking about

1962.71 --> 1965.25
his silly space stories a lot anymore

1964.45 --> 1969.78
anyway

1965.25 --> 1969.78
he has other types of stories now

1978.14 --> 1983.5400000000002
Alex Jones doesn't want to defend Effie

1980.93 --> 1988.19
that's why he runs away he can score it

1983.54 --> 1990.98
on their feet yeah he does definitely

1988.19 --> 1993.41
run away and it's like on camera where

1990.98 --> 1995.6
he would just be there like no no I'm

1993.41 --> 1999.0800000000002
just gonna act all silly and crazy and

1995.6 --> 2002.4099999999999
funny because I am going to deny this no

1999.08 --> 2005.4099999999999
matter what like a mauler yeah he did

2002.41 --> 2007.51
that so but that's really his personal

2005.41 --> 2009.94
choice I don't think it is like a he'll

2007.51 --> 2013.27
set up I think he's a true believer or

2009.94 --> 2015.55
an addict to the belief personally it's

2013.27 --> 2017.83
not something he's been ordered to do I

2015.55 --> 2020.1699999999998
think he's been giving that option at

2017.83 --> 2023.4399999999998
some point he was like [ __ ] yeah space

2020.17 --> 2025.75
[ __ ] I'm going there I believe it and

2023.44 --> 2029.23
he just went with it and everybody's

2025.75 --> 2039.82
like okay and that's okay we got plenty

2029.23 --> 2042.3600000000001
of plans for you then right and benefits

2039.82 --> 2042.36
probably

2051.56 --> 2056.15
but anyway yeah it don't really talk

2054.05 --> 2059.48
about flat earth over an Alex Jones is

2056.15 --> 2061.159
just the freaking politics just the

2059.48 --> 2064.22
politics that's it

2061.159 --> 2068.84
that's that's what it is now it's just

2064.22 --> 2072.2799999999997
that and yeah some general education

2068.84 --> 2076.78
about world politics and stuff too and

2072.28 --> 2076.78
but this is kind of general stuff by now

2078.88 --> 2086.96
haha Dark Matter exists because if we if

2082.31 --> 2090.37
it didn't we'd be wrong yep a dark

2086.96 --> 2100.34
matter is a natural consequence of the

2090.37 --> 2101.99
unresolved gravity equation is it's

2100.34 --> 2106.73
because of gravity it's there because of

2101.99 --> 2110.87
gravity gravity has caused so much crap

2106.73 --> 2113.69
oh it's like no you can't solve it

2110.87 --> 2116.9
you're not allowed to solve it but you

2113.69 --> 2119.54
can try so go ahead people in

2116.9 --> 2122.48
universities you're smart right you got

2119.54 --> 2124.55
the paper so you try and work around

2122.48 --> 2128.6
what you actually need to solve in order

2124.55 --> 2134.03
to solve this problem uh what if there

2128.6 --> 2137.24
was this substance I couldn't see it and

2134.03 --> 2139.82
you can't detect it but it's so strong

2137.24 --> 2141.14
that it offsets the imbalance in the

2139.82 --> 2144.4700000000003
gravity even though we don't really

2141.14 --> 2145.0099999999998
understand what gravity is would that

2144.47 --> 2149.06
work

2145.01 --> 2153.11
Dark Matter yes we did it we finally

2149.06 --> 2160.93
solved the problem or rather bypassed it

2153.11 --> 2160.9300000000003
again yeah dark matter dark energy

2161.05 --> 2167.09
it's from the darkness from the in from

2164.6 --> 2171.29
the lack of light from the inability to

2167.09 --> 2175.3
actually be allowed to resolve the

2171.29 --> 2175.3
problem in a proper way

2191.48 --> 2198.13
you have well you can see the effect of

2194.81 --> 2198.13
the wind and you can hear it

2207.23 --> 2218.48
I hear it constantly now Steve it's not

2216.17 --> 2221.9
too dark to see it's not because of a

2218.48 --> 2224.06
lack of it's literally invisible lat

2221.9 --> 2229.67
light does not affect it it passes

2224.06 --> 2233.45
through it without any effect so you

2229.67 --> 2237.23
can't know it's there but it can be

2233.45 --> 2239.8689999999997
calculated to be there or the gravity

2237.23 --> 2243.4
assumption on which the whole system

2239.869 --> 2243.4
rest would be wrong

2250.52 --> 2255.57
[Music]

2255.67 --> 2263.779
No yeah yeah that's exactly what I said

2260.0 --> 2265.73
that's not no that's yes yes I heard the

2263.779 --> 2268.69
effect of the wind that's exactly what I

2265.73 --> 2268.69
said that's right

2275.02 --> 2278.23
[Music]

2280.109 --> 2286.44
no no no that's see I can hear it I can

2284.4 --> 2288.829
perceive it isn't it by perception isn't

2286.44 --> 2291.4790000000003
it about distinguishing it from

2288.829 --> 2293.819
something else right in order to

2291.479 --> 2297.959
establish it is there well guess what

2293.819 --> 2301.619
all the elements that are available to

2297.959 --> 2304.589
beings and consciousnesses in order to

2301.619 --> 2305.069
perceive something do not apply to dark

2304.589 --> 2309.45
matter

2305.069 --> 2313.14
Yaba there is nothing else that people

2309.45 --> 2315.18
have ever even tried to conceive that

2313.14 --> 2317.959
abides by those standards and is still

2315.18 --> 2317.959
taking serious

2323.89 --> 2332.2889999999998
yes I hear the effect of it I can deduce

2328.42 --> 2335.65
wind is happening because things are

2332.289 --> 2337.4500000000003
moving and the reason they are moving is

2335.65 --> 2339.94
because there is an air current going

2337.45 --> 2342.549
through it and that makes sound and

2339.94 --> 2345.43
there is a visual movement going on

2342.549 --> 2348.279
therefore I can a very easily deduce

2345.43 --> 2350.2889999999998
that there is air displacement which is

2348.279 --> 2370.45
also known as wind now have you got a

2350.289 --> 2372.489
point with this tiny Womble shut up if

2370.45 --> 2377.0789999999997
you're going to be a smartass like that

2372.489 --> 2379.45
then yeah keep it up and yeah we'll

2377.079 --> 2381.819
terminate the freaking relationship as a

2379.45 --> 2383.259
baller you can just [ __ ] off that and if

2381.819 --> 2385.89
you're going to be a smartass like that

2383.259 --> 2385.89
how about that

2396.61 --> 2405.19
yeah but we say people say the wind

2401.98 --> 2408.79
makes a sound you know just like a

2405.19 --> 2411.37
vacuum sucks right we say it and

2408.79 --> 2414.2799999999997
everybody knows what you mean it's

2411.37 --> 2417.7
called communication I'm sorry if it's

2414.28 --> 2422.26
not technically perfect every single

2417.7 --> 2425.77
time because I am NOT a my life is not a

2422.26 --> 2428.7000000000003
physics explanation okay I use language

2425.77 --> 2454.66
to communicate not just physics

2428.7 --> 2457.29
okey-dokey all right so let's not get

2454.66 --> 2461.08
too over he didn't get a footbath and

2457.29 --> 2463.09
stop being a smartass we're not even

2461.08 --> 2468.61
talking physics right now we were

2463.09 --> 2473.29
talking mechanics and somebody else drew

2468.61 --> 2475.48
in wind and just because you can't see

2473.29 --> 2478.57
it apparently is enough reason for them

2475.48 --> 2480.37
to compare it for me not believing in

2478.57 --> 2482.4100000000003
dark matter that I shouldn't believe in

2480.37 --> 2487.2
wind which is ridiculous because there

2482.41 --> 2491.47
is plenty around to deduce from literal

2487.2 --> 2494.14
observations detections changes that can

2491.47 --> 2496.87
be perceived in order to deduce that

2494.14 --> 2500.3799999999997
there is something definitely there the

2496.87 --> 2503.3399999999997
same does not count for dark matter it's

2500.38 --> 2510.28
a false equivalence you can't compare it

2503.34 --> 2513.73
so it's it's just a straw man a a

2510.28 --> 2516.78
bollard and a straw man argument who

2513.73 --> 2516.78
would have seen that coming

2544.89 --> 2548.0299999999997
[Music]

2548.23 --> 2554.29
hmm it works surprisingly well I have to

2551.68 --> 2558.99
say the food bath thing would have to

2554.29 --> 2558.99
careful not to get our regular foot feet

2559.5 --> 2567.82
no I'm liking this foot bath so far I'm

2565.869 --> 2572.23
not getting like any like heat waves

2567.82 --> 2574.599
that are breaking my focus although I am

2572.23 --> 2579.4900000000002
good I'm still freaking out I am still

2574.599 --> 2581.67
somewhat sweaty so that's better than

2579.49 --> 2581.6699999999996
without

2593.5 --> 2601.51
all right anyway yeah dark matter it's

2598.48 --> 2604.77
it's nothing it's literally a fictional

2601.51 --> 2609.1000000000004
construct in order to offset

2604.77 --> 2611.17
it's a highly fantastical fictional

2609.1 --> 2613.06
construct - because yeah because it's

2611.17 --> 2615.1
literally the Emperor without closed

2613.06 --> 2617.08
scenario it's like something that cannot

2615.1 --> 2619.2999999999997
be detected you just have to accept it's

2617.08 --> 2622.9
there that's exactly what dark matter is

2619.3 --> 2627.7200000000003
okay the Emperor's clothes are made out

2622.9 --> 2631.06
of dark matter yeah

2627.72 --> 2638.4399999999996
this story could literally be rewritten

2631.06 --> 2640.71
with that small added detail in it what

2638.44 --> 2640.71
work

2680.15 --> 2682.7200000000003
yeah

2685.38 --> 2689.579
and it's funny you know because dark

2687.599 --> 2694.619
matter and dark energy there's still

2689.579 --> 2699.119
just a subject you can pick up in

2694.619 --> 2704.489
physics or rather in theoretical physics

2699.119 --> 2709.2000000000003
it's just in there and yeah people are

2704.489 --> 2713.15
even like considering okay going for

2709.2 --> 2717.14
that making it their life their project

2713.15 --> 2717.14
it's so ridiculous

2720.019 --> 2725.64
now I bet that a lot of people when

2722.999 --> 2728.009
they're even working on it not a lot of

2725.64 --> 2730.0789999999997
people but enough enough people would

2728.009 --> 2731.759
probably figure out like what the [ __ ]

2730.079 --> 2733.6800000000003
is going on you know they would have way

2731.759 --> 2736.829
awakened like wait with this gravity

2733.68 --> 2738.3289999999997
thing it's like let's let's see what's

2736.829 --> 2739.9500000000003
going around in the trenches on the

2738.329 --> 2742.1090000000004
internet what are people saying about it

2739.95 --> 2746.6299999999997
these days and they come back like oh my

2742.109 --> 2747.8089999999997
god I didn't know it was this bad [ __ ]

2746.63 --> 2752.099
okay

2747.809 --> 2754.44
okay let's step back here oh right okay

2752.099 --> 2757.4990000000003
I could I did drop out of school right

2754.44 --> 2759.569
now and try to snow weight college money

2757.499 --> 2764.1899999999996
I have to finish it or it's gonna not

2759.569 --> 2768.5389999999998
gonna get my loan back right okay I'll

2764.19 --> 2777.079
just write a story about how it's not

2768.539 --> 2777.079
really working and hmm yeah

2780.859 --> 2786.019
or who knows maybe they'll get all

2783.46 --> 2789.259
fantastically inspired and imagine this

2786.019 --> 2791.6299999999997
dark matter universe where it's like the

2789.259 --> 2793.339
antimatter it turns out to be dark

2791.63 --> 2795.8900000000003
matter and there's an entire universe

2793.339 --> 2797.989
made out of dark matter and from the

2795.89 --> 2802.46
dark matter universe everything looks

2797.989 --> 2804.95
normal but then the regular matter looks

2802.46 --> 2808.549
like dark matter in the dark matter

2804.95 --> 2819.739
universe dirt dude and we got a science

2808.549 --> 2821.299
fiction book you know I'm right maybe

2819.739 --> 2823.579
there already is one like that I

2821.299 --> 2825.259
wouldn't be surprised one bit you know

2823.579 --> 2840.819
dark matter has been around for a long

2825.259 --> 2849.2
time what am I having for supper tonight

2840.819 --> 2852.46
hamburger self-made of course and some

2849.2 --> 2852.46
french fries as usual

2865.1 --> 2868.75
me sorry bear what

2869.96 --> 2874.79
that should be enough to realize the

2872.9 --> 2879.2000000000003
absolute contradiction but it saved the

2874.79 --> 2881.39
world from God yeah well you can only

2879.2 --> 2887.33
save the world from God with absolute

2881.39 --> 2888.89
contradictions that's like a really deep

2887.33 --> 2896.72
truth if you think about it very

2888.89 --> 2898.2799999999997
carefully I will set as much as well we

2896.72 --> 2900.68
can't allow this to happen for a

2898.28 --> 2903.32
philosophical reasons like yeah we can

2900.68 --> 2908.4199999999996
allow this truth to sink in and then

2903.32 --> 2911.54
move on but we can't because this hobby

2908.42 --> 2914.57
is just too interesting too much has

2911.54 --> 2917.48
been invested too many people basically

2914.57 --> 2920.1800000000003
put their lives on the line for this

2917.48 --> 2921.47
game that turns out to be fake but we

2920.18 --> 2924.0989999999997
got to keep it going

2921.47 --> 2928.609
there's an entire generation now

2924.099 --> 2931.4900000000002
dependent on us upholding that as the

2928.609 --> 2935.74
truth it's called the baby boomer

2931.49 --> 2935.74
generation when to the moon

2944.53 --> 2947.739
[Music]

2963.5 --> 2971.03
that's tiny womble what you just said

2967.099 --> 2974.44
there is total blabbering nonsense you

2971.03 --> 2980.59
literally just made such a brutal

2974.44 --> 2982.84
mistake it's unbelievable unbelievable

2980.59 --> 2986.7200000000003
okay

2982.84 --> 2990.76
the term dark matter is used to describe

2986.72 --> 2996.6189999999997
a phenomenon that is currently

2990.76 --> 3000.3300000000004
undiscovered fully yeah that you can't

2996.619 --> 3004.69
have a phenomena that is undiscovered

3000.33 --> 3007.81
that is a blatant visceral contradiction

3004.69 --> 3014.4700000000003
with what a phenomena is if it's not

3007.81 --> 3020.23
discovered then it's not a phenomena for

3014.47 --> 3022.75
real for real you can't have unexplained

3020.23 --> 3026.14
yeah I can't have undiscovered phenomena

3022.75 --> 3030.49
then it's not a phenomena no no you

3026.14 --> 3034.68
can't if it's not discovered it's then

3030.49 --> 3034.68
you can't call it a phenomena a

3034.95 --> 3041.71
phenomena is real it's something that

3038.44 --> 3044.68
you can detect or perceive and then you

3041.71 --> 3047.89
study it now if you're gonna presume

3044.68 --> 3050.71
that something must be there in order

3047.89 --> 3053.5299999999997
for something else to work then you

3050.71 --> 3056.14
could call it an undiscovered phenomena

3053.53 --> 3058.57
but it's basically saying no it's a

3056.14 --> 3061.089
concept and we're just really hoping we

3058.57 --> 3063.4
will find it one day yeah that's what

3061.089 --> 3067.44
that means it's not a phenomena then if

3063.4 --> 3067.44
it's not discovered this is ridiculous

3071.94 --> 3078.51
yeah that's right you observe something

3075.539 --> 3080.0690000000004
but you don't know the cost no or you

3078.51 --> 3085.4
could know the cost but the thing is you

3080.069 --> 3089.94
observe it right so if there is a

3085.4 --> 3094.309
phenomena but you haven't discovered it

3089.94 --> 3099.4500000000003
yet meaning you haven't observed it

3094.309 --> 3105.049
perceived it detected it right then it's

3099.45 --> 3105.049
not a phenomena it's not a phenomenon

3117.76 --> 3123.17
it's the meaning of words tiny Womble

3120.6 --> 3126.3489999999997
meaning of words

3123.17 --> 3126.349
[Music]

3131.3 --> 3139.82
I think I could safely state that if you

3136.61 --> 3144.59
can't perceive or detect it then it's

3139.82 --> 3150.86
not a phenomenon just like if you can't

3144.59 --> 3153.2200000000003
see it then it's not a horizon it's very

3150.86 --> 3157.58
similar actually now to think about it

3153.22 --> 3159.6499999999996
eerily similar hmm no it's not a

3157.58 --> 3161.9
language problem it's absolutely not a

3159.65 --> 3162.94
language problem tiny whoa oh no it's

3161.9 --> 3166.85
not

3162.94 --> 3170.66
phenomenon thing that is observed

3166.85 --> 3173.87
detected in order for you to know there

3170.66 --> 3177.5899999999997
is something right that makes it a

3173.87 --> 3179.96
phenomenon if you have to discover it if

3177.59 --> 3183.38
you have to freaking find it first you

3179.96 --> 3184.67
don't even know if it's there for sure

3183.38 --> 3187.48
because you haven't found you have to

3184.67 --> 3192.4
discover it then it's not a phenomenon

3187.48 --> 3192.4
it's a contradiction in terms

3199.14 --> 3203.64
well what are you talking about the

3201.119 --> 3207.98
Mikey Nigel while you're repeating

3203.64 --> 3207.98
yourself what fully

3218.599 --> 3225.7000000000003
it's been discovered has it really where

3221.63 --> 3232.489
I was a detective how was it measured

3225.7 --> 3235.3089999999997
observed I think you're lying now to

3232.489 --> 3239.63
anyone I know I kind of put you on the

3235.309 --> 3244.579
spot this is you're just wrong this is

3239.63 --> 3248.299
wrong and I don't want to start treating

3244.579 --> 3250.279
you like Nathan treats people even

3248.299 --> 3252.079
though you'd probably deserve it at this

3250.279 --> 3254.109
point for saying something as stupid as

3252.079 --> 3254.1090000000004
that

3278.45 --> 3284.5589999999997
it's just one little step away from

3280.789 --> 3287.259
getting a timeout here get out of here

3284.559 --> 3290.1800000000003
why don't you bring it up to Nathan

3287.259 --> 3297.529
bring it up to Nathan Oakley see how

3290.18 --> 3299.989
that goes it's a concept it's not a

3297.529 --> 3306.849
theory it's definitely not a scientific

3299.989 --> 3312.68
theory it falls under theoretical

3306.849 --> 3316.94
physics and cosmology née cosmology it's

3312.68 --> 3320.69
not science there's definitely not a

3316.94 --> 3325.779
viable hypothesis or theory for it it's

3320.69 --> 3325.779
a concept and there is no proof for it

3326.349 --> 3333.049
it's literally it's like the standard

3330.009 --> 3335.599
basis it's like this is the front line

3333.049 --> 3338.329
this is what is said about it you can

3335.599 --> 3347.119
see it you can observe it you can detect

3338.329 --> 3350.3900000000003
it that's what it is to start out it has

3347.119 --> 3355.609
been discovered oh we did actually see

3350.39 --> 3358.7
it see it did you know you didn't the

3355.609 --> 3362.8089999999997
whole point is that you can't that's how

3358.7 --> 3366.589
it is established stop contradicting

3362.809 --> 3370.329
yourself stop contradicting yourself

3366.589 --> 3370.3289999999997
stop contradicting yourself

3375.87 --> 3380.39
[Music]

3377.44 --> 3382.789
no you don't you don't see any effect

3380.39 --> 3386.029
they don't even know what the effect is

3382.789 --> 3389.779
it's just there to sit there in the way

3386.029 --> 3391.849
in order to counteract the cluster [ __ ]

3389.779 --> 3396.44
that isn't even understood known as

3391.849 --> 3397.46
gravity that's what it is there is no

3396.44 --> 3400.4900000000002
effect

3397.46 --> 3403.9900000000002
tiny Womble stop lying or this is your

3400.49 --> 3403.99
last day here on this show

3436.619 --> 3442.6600000000003
right so I'm gonna round it out and if

3439.24 --> 3445.359
he's smart it's gonna shut his mouth for

3442.66 --> 3447.8799999999997
now and think about the stupid things he

3445.359 --> 3450.0989999999997
said and actually do some research on

3447.88 --> 3453.55
the bluff comments he made in order to

3450.099 --> 3456.01
establish that he's wrong then you can

3453.55 --> 3461.8
apologize the next time you come here at

3456.01 --> 3463.8100000000004
tiny Womble I don't care how polite you

3461.8 --> 3466.329
are don't pull a conspiracy cat's on me

3463.81 --> 3469.32
if you're just straight-out making

3466.329 --> 3472.3590000000004
claims that are absolutely not true

3469.32 --> 3476.32
officially established that means you're

3472.359 --> 3480.609
lying or you are delusional and bluffing

3476.32 --> 3487.0
I don't accept that in my chat tiny

3480.609 --> 3492.39
mumble yeah so yeah you're definitely

3487.0 --> 3495.88
getting a timeout for that it's done

3492.39 --> 3497.89
yeah you made claims about proof for

3495.88 --> 3500.349
freaking dark matter and it's been

3497.89 --> 3505.3799999999997
detected that you can see it somehow

3500.349 --> 3508.7200000000003
it's all lies and you know it's lies and

3505.38 --> 3511.7200000000003
you are going to find the proof that it

3508.72 --> 3514.48
is lies by pointing at what is

3511.72 --> 3516.5499999999997
officially established about it and then

3514.48 --> 3518.68
you're gonna get back to me and you're
