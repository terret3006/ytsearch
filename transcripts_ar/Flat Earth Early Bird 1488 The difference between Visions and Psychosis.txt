7.89 --> 37.769999999999996
[Music]

58.399 --> 63.32

90.78 --> 95.34
and yeah I can definitely use the

93.36 --> 97.079
support

95.34 --> 100.619
please keep it coming

97.079 --> 104.1
right the weather today is

100.619 --> 106.439
well kind of the same it's a bit Misty

104.1 --> 109.19999999999999
slightly

106.439 --> 112.13999999999999
uh there's been no new snow but the snow

109.2 --> 115.43900000000001
from yesterday is like half of it is

112.14 --> 116.42
still just around hasn't melted or

115.439 --> 120.25899999999999
anything

116.42 --> 120.259
and it is pretty cold

121.439 --> 131.72
I think it's probably water cold like

125.82 --> 131.72
like one or two above zero Celsius

132.18 --> 135.68
because it feels really cold

139.2 --> 142.2
okay

149.819 --> 155.94
low turret

152.04 --> 158.34
there are 306 first in chat CU LSG good

155.94 --> 161.0
to see you

158.34 --> 161.0
foreign

163.64 --> 170.879
it is Saturday the 21st of January 2023

172.8 --> 177.3
let's see what the temperature is

174.89 --> 181.879
[Music]

177.3 --> 181.87900000000002
yeah one to resell shoes I knew it

181.98 --> 185.76
if it were below that it would be less

184.56 --> 188.7
cold

185.76 --> 191.54
it would feel less cold that's why it's

188.7 --> 191.54
water cold

194.28 --> 199.8
because there's just more moist in the

196.5 --> 201.599
air hence the mistiness and

199.8 --> 203.459
it just

201.599 --> 205.319
extracts Heat

203.459 --> 207.959
from you quicker

205.319 --> 210.98
than if it were freezing because then it

207.959 --> 210.98
would be drier

216.42 --> 219.2
anyway

221.519 --> 224.59900000000002
how are you guys doing

224.9 --> 229.34
my show yesterday was pretty intense

234.9 --> 242.0
still over the crazy internet thing that

237.599 --> 242.0
happened and split my show apart

243.42 --> 249.42
I mean that kind of ruined it in a way

245.94 --> 251.76
if technically I guess that videos could

249.42 --> 253.55999999999997
be just sewn back together with that

251.76 --> 255.54
piece cut out and then it would have

253.56 --> 258.66
been great because

255.54 --> 263.299
after that was just behind me

258.66 --> 263.29900000000004
thought it was very fluid

263.82 --> 267.96
although yeah

266.16 --> 271.44
I still would like to get some feedback

267.96 --> 274.08
like even asked illest Geo for the over

271.44 --> 276.259
Skype LSG haven't had any response from

274.08 --> 276.25899999999996
you

279.9 --> 285.38
like Could you actually follow what I

282.9 --> 285.38
was saying

290.699 --> 296.639
and can you relate

294.0 --> 299.04
like have you had like moments in your

296.639 --> 300.36
life when you were younger that

299.04 --> 302.639
you

300.36 --> 305.16
got involved in something really

302.639 --> 308.699
shocking and it like jolted you awake

305.16 --> 312.32000000000005
like you suddenly became

308.699 --> 312.32
an adult version of yourself

314.639 --> 320.36
right and I'd like to hear other

316.68 --> 320.36
people's feedback on that too

328.08 --> 335.21999999999997
didn't take me as being flustered no

331.199 --> 337.56
I wasn't flustered I was just like

335.22 --> 340.68
organizing my thoughts and my

337.56 --> 344.4
expressions in a different kind of way

340.68 --> 346.38
it it becomes like a fractal and

344.4 --> 349.79999999999995
normally when people do that there's

346.38 --> 352.259
other people that typically go into that

349.8 --> 353.46000000000004
mood but they actually do become

352.259 --> 356.039
flustered

353.46 --> 358.73999999999995
one of those people is Merle

356.039 --> 360.65999999999997
who is actually pretty Visionary but he

358.74 --> 363.84000000000003
just hasn't doesn't have control it's

360.66 --> 366.12
stress completely derails him

363.84 --> 369.06
it doesn't do that with me

366.12 --> 372.0
uniquely maybe although there's probably

369.06 --> 374.759
other people out there that also

372.0 --> 377.58
can keep their wits about it when doing

374.759 --> 380.52000000000004
it because when you do it you you like

377.58 --> 383.4
start rolling and you keep rolling but

380.52 --> 386.58
you lose track of what you're doing

383.4 --> 388.31899999999996
right well I used to do had that too

386.58 --> 391.02
that's typically a response by the way

388.319 --> 393.18
of cannabis and yeah I am still smoking

391.02 --> 395.84
cannabis right no more alcohol though no

393.18 --> 395.84000000000003
more green tea

396.6 --> 399.259
foreign

401.28 --> 405.539
well typically when you get rolling

403.5 --> 407.759
start but behaving in that type of

405.539 --> 411.419
pattern but I figured out a way

407.759 --> 414.539
to kind of hijack that system

411.419 --> 417.29999999999995
and apply fractal thinking to it

414.539 --> 419.039
but it can be tricky like sometimes I

417.3 --> 421.38
slightly lose balance and that's the

419.039 --> 424.919
moment where I'm like damn it what was I

421.38 --> 427.74
trying to say then I can't get it back

424.919 --> 430.08
but still if I had perfect Focus I

427.74 --> 432.36
wouldn't have those moments even

430.08 --> 435.24
right

432.36 --> 438.90000000000003
because what I was doing was basically

435.24 --> 442.02
trying to puzzle together like intense

438.9 --> 444.65999999999997
memories and really like putting them in

442.02 --> 446.78
a row to like try to form a history out

444.66 --> 449.97
of it out of my memory

446.78 --> 449.96999999999997
[Music]

450.0 --> 453.24
because

451.259 --> 456.36
well the Dark World Visions are

453.24 --> 459.36
extremely tricky to me when it comes to

456.36 --> 463.139
placing it them within time you see

459.36 --> 465.66
because time works differently there and

463.139 --> 469.02
so does your Consciousness when it is

465.66 --> 472.319
there so it's like really the normal

469.02 --> 474.419
time based thing that you experience and

472.319 --> 477.18
with your memory use

474.419 --> 478.62
to place it very easily it doesn't work

477.18 --> 480.78000000000003
as well there

478.62 --> 484.56
so it's always been really tricky trying

480.78 --> 488.15999999999997
to place it and when I got my re

484.56 --> 490.34
visit moment like in 2015 or 14

488.16 --> 492.78000000000003
somewhere there

490.34 --> 494.69899999999996
remembering my Dark World Visions and it

492.78 --> 497.21999999999997
would be kind of scared about it I had

494.699 --> 499.44
no clue where it all was it was like

497.22 --> 502.139
just this separated world and I couldn't

499.44 --> 504.96
connect it it's what the [ __ ] is this

502.139 --> 506.52
and like all these memories but I can't

504.96 --> 508.37899999999996
really place them anymore I'm not even

506.52 --> 510.479
sure like when they really happened did

508.379 --> 513.24
they all happen in one moment

510.479 --> 515.279
or were they actually spread out and if

513.24 --> 518.52
they were spread out well then why would

515.279 --> 521.82
I tap back into them

518.52 --> 523.38
in dreams because I have had well very

521.82 --> 527.779
conscious moments where I'm just

523.38 --> 527.779
dreaming and then I tap into that

528.12 --> 536.4590000000001
but also sort of separated from that

532.92 --> 538.92
just these moments in the dark world and

536.459 --> 540.54
a lot of them it's very difficult to

538.92 --> 543.06
place

540.54 --> 544.68
so to me it's like this puzzle this time

543.06 --> 547.8599999999999
puzzle

544.68 --> 550.14
and I was trying to arrange some things

547.86 --> 553.62
without giving away too much information

550.14 --> 556.26
because I just don't want to talk about

553.62 --> 557.88
the more horrific things like publicly

556.26 --> 559.92
like that

557.88 --> 562.5
they're really scary I don't want to

559.92 --> 564.86
give away details it's just I don't want

562.5 --> 564.86
that

567.54 --> 572.64
when I was younger going to that level

570.3 --> 575.76
and talking about that which is like

572.64 --> 578.88
actual horror basically actual

575.76 --> 581.459
mental even talking about it

578.88 --> 584.22
at like very

581.459 --> 586.9799999999999
had massive fear

584.22 --> 588.72
on me because of that and I would be

586.98 --> 590.22
able to suppress that in a moment but I

588.72 --> 592.5
would then get like totally have

590.22 --> 594.24
nightmares over it basically and I do

592.5 --> 595.92
not want to cause that on to other

594.24 --> 598.019
people that might be sensitive and

595.92 --> 600.42
following me which they have good reason

598.019 --> 602.16
to follow me because I am here basically

600.42 --> 604.14
to help you train

602.16 --> 606.68
how to deal with that sensitivity

604.14 --> 610.4399999999999
without

606.68 --> 612.959
losing it or losing your mind which is

610.44 --> 614.6400000000001
what I have attempted to do all my life

612.959 --> 616.68
and I think that I've been pretty

614.64 --> 618.959
successful at it even though I've not

616.68 --> 621.3599999999999
accomplished

618.959 --> 623.54
properly integrating with society as

621.36 --> 623.54
much

624.0 --> 632.06
and that might be possible I I just

628.26 --> 632.06
hasn't worked out thus far

632.64 --> 636.36
maybe because I'm a little over focused

634.86 --> 638.94
on that project

636.36 --> 641.76
on that live project

638.94 --> 643.9200000000001
because it's so essential when you

641.76 --> 646.62
because there's a lot of empaths out

643.92 --> 648.959
there naturally like that

646.62 --> 650.519
that end up just becoming classified

648.959 --> 651.779
autistic

650.519 --> 653.82
or

651.779 --> 656.7
insane

653.82 --> 658.2
they end up attracting getting possessed

656.7 --> 660.839
really severely because of their

658.2 --> 663.1800000000001
rejection from society

660.839 --> 667.1400000000001
and then it gets worse and they get more

663.18 --> 670.9799999999999
demonic and they become evil Psychopaths

667.14 --> 673.14
right a lot of evil Psychopaths you

670.98 --> 674.88
might not understand it doesn't even

673.14 --> 677.04
matter anymore because when they're like

674.88 --> 679.14
that it doesn't matter anymore where

677.04 --> 681.959
they came from really

679.14 --> 684.42
because they've gone too far they've let

681.959 --> 686.459
it slide too much and just because

684.42 --> 689.8199999999999
Society didn't connect with them is not

686.459 --> 692.0999999999999
an excuse you see

689.82 --> 694.98
right

692.1 --> 698.16
but they all a lot of them started out

694.98 --> 699.899
like brilliant empaths

698.16 --> 702.3
and then

699.899 --> 707.579
they didn't know what to do with it and

702.3 --> 710.459
people just do like creepy they they do

707.579 --> 714.3199999999999
[ __ ] up stuff with you

710.459 --> 714.3199999999999
to try to mold you in some way

714.779 --> 718.7
and that's happened to me

720.12 --> 722.6
right

727.019 --> 731.519
in a way arguably you could even say

729.54 --> 734.459
that at certain points I was aware of

731.519 --> 738.12
that and I was going along with it

734.459 --> 741.3599999999999
because I did not want to be

738.12 --> 744.36
like this isolated like

741.36 --> 746.519
I didn't want to let my

744.36 --> 749.7
Focus

746.519 --> 752.16
my empathy go but I didn't want to not

749.7 --> 753.899
be integrated with Society either

752.16 --> 756.54
and I've always been into like this

753.899 --> 759.0
dualistic position concerning that where

756.54 --> 761.24
I can't really find a proper balance not

759.0 --> 761.24
really

761.459 --> 765.1199999999999
it's almost like a wound that just could

763.92 --> 770.3
never heal

765.12 --> 770.3
until one part of me just breaks

774.0 --> 778.139
kind of tricky

776.279 --> 781.079
right but

778.139 --> 783.42
I'm just keep it going and until I start

781.079 --> 786.0
to see that

783.42 --> 788.36
until I start to see reflections of what

786.0 --> 788.36
I'm doing

789.0 --> 795.18
I need to see people that have this

792.18 --> 797.519
I what I'm basically waiting for is to

795.18 --> 800.7199999999999
meet people that can really teach me

797.519 --> 800.72
about my skill

801.12 --> 808.26
because I've never met any really I've

804.3 --> 810.42
met people that have tricks like I do a

808.26 --> 812.399
couple and they know how to utilize it

810.42 --> 814.62
for themselves and sometimes they

812.399 --> 817.32
recognize people with which it works and

814.62 --> 819.54
then they apply that's cool

817.32 --> 821.7
but never the way that I've been doing

819.54 --> 823.86
things

821.7 --> 825.4200000000001
like my real internal function because

823.86 --> 827.76
it's

825.42 --> 831.8
compared to others like I feel really

827.76 --> 831.8
like a computer processor sometimes

831.98 --> 838.62
it's the way my spirit moves internally

836.04 --> 841.1999999999999
it's not like demonic or evil and

838.62 --> 846.44
restrained it's

841.2 --> 846.44
mechanical it's it's like almost

847.32 --> 853.74
it's just like a computer sometimes it's

850.26 --> 855.98
but it feelings are are part of it

853.74 --> 855.98
though

856.16 --> 860.459
it's yeah I mean this is getting kind of

858.899 --> 864.42
fuzzy I guess

860.459 --> 866.76
my description like very esoteric

864.42 --> 871.16
like how am I describing my in the the

866.76 --> 871.16
the forms of my inner thinking

872.339 --> 877.74
and a lot of people

875.76 --> 880.3199999999999
from what I've sensed because I've

877.74 --> 882.3
literally seen people just actively

880.32 --> 884.1
trying to think and all that and I get a

882.3 --> 886.459
lot of data I'm at spiritual metadata

884.1 --> 886.4590000000001
from that

887.16 --> 893.959
it's their internal world is much slower

891.24 --> 893.9590000000001
than mine

894.66 --> 900.66
because with me it's like

897.62 --> 901.68
and it's like some like uh for example

900.66 --> 904.56
how

901.68 --> 906.54
in The Matrix right Neo

904.56 --> 908.5999999999999
goes to the program and gets the

906.54 --> 911.2199999999999
training right upload it

908.6 --> 914.88
right and you see the fisher fisher

911.22 --> 917.1
flash well that's how fast it actually

914.88 --> 920.16
happens inside

917.1 --> 922.26
but not with like the a shocking impact

920.16 --> 924.42
of it because that's how it's always

922.26 --> 926.9399999999999
going in there

924.42 --> 929.279
and when I first saw the Matrix that

926.94 --> 930.9590000000001
happening I was like

929.279 --> 934.56
yes

930.959 --> 934.56
yes that

935.339 --> 945.8000000000001
that's what I'm doing except yeah

940.079 --> 945.8
it it it in a lot of it stays internal

946.139 --> 951.42
in the past when I was younger I would

948.66 --> 954.779
literally just assimilate skills and

951.42 --> 957.18
just be able to freaking do it now I'm

954.779 --> 959.3389999999999
just become more careful it's like oh

957.18 --> 961.38
yeah I I got all these things that I

959.339 --> 963.9590000000001
could potentially do but should I

961.38 --> 965.88
actually do them

963.959 --> 969.3599999999999
right

965.88 --> 972.18
and a lot of it is no

969.36 --> 974.88
I have to actually like chill out

972.18 --> 977.899
physically

974.88 --> 981.36
if I because otherwise I'm gonna end up

977.899 --> 983.699
exhausting myself and then that system

981.36 --> 986.16
will stop

983.699 --> 988.8
functioning like that

986.16 --> 992.16
I will become exhausted and then I will

988.8 --> 995.04
like have it turn off momentarily

992.16 --> 999.54
right so this is yeah

995.04 --> 1002.7199999999999
says what's happening here inside of me

999.54 --> 1006.8199999999999
like pretty much

1002.72 --> 1006.82
since I first can't remember

1009.139 --> 1013.339
I still do have memories of not being

1011.779 --> 1016.72
like being

1013.339 --> 1019.639
really a more normal functioning person

1016.72 --> 1021.32
like of the moral functioning I'm

1019.639 --> 1023.9590000000001
talking about like my number five and

1021.32 --> 1025.419
six among other people that I would

1023.959 --> 1028.3999999999999
literally just

1025.419 --> 1031.459
become like them with their frequency in

1028.4 --> 1034.8190000000002
their lower routine and it would make me

1031.459 --> 1037.88
so hurt and miserable I would like

1034.819 --> 1040.459
become instantly depressed

1037.88 --> 1042.5590000000002
or not ins it would slowly start to

1040.459 --> 1044.059
happen and then eventually it would be

1042.559 --> 1047.559
like help

1044.059 --> 1047.559
what's happening to me

1049.04 --> 1054.6789999999999
because it's like a natural

1051.98 --> 1056.419
frequency for me to function like when I

1054.679 --> 1058.1200000000001
was very little I was surrounded by

1056.419 --> 1060.5800000000002
little kids

1058.12 --> 1063.86
and I'm like

1060.58 --> 1068.0
help me I want to learn mathematics

1063.86 --> 1070.6999999999998
but I couldn't even properly say that

1068.0 --> 1072.3
but literally like that

1070.7 --> 1075.5
I was yeah

1072.3 --> 1075.5
[Music]

1075.559 --> 1080.6
as soon as I could talk like people

1077.72 --> 1083.419
would instantly recognize like oh [ __ ]

1080.6 --> 1086.62
he's really talking though

1083.419 --> 1086.6200000000001
like like an adult

1086.78 --> 1094.52
like even getting yeah just getting the

1091.039 --> 1098.72
details like because I learned it

1094.52 --> 1101.179
using my parent skills right mimic

1098.72 --> 1102.799
I've been I'm not that's a lot how I do

1101.179 --> 1104.8400000000001
a lot because it's like a natural skill

1102.799 --> 1107.66
I really have like a parrot skill I can

1104.84 --> 1110.32
just mimic something instantly never

1107.66 --> 1110.3200000000002
heard it before

1112.1 --> 1116.5
and that's also How I Learned language

1116.78 --> 1121.7
right

1117.86 --> 1123.62
and even now I can sometimes if I really

1121.7 --> 1126.44
Zone in

1123.62 --> 1128.12
understand foreign languages

1126.44 --> 1131.24
but not

1128.12 --> 1133.28
not like with my intellectual part but

1131.24 --> 1136.34
I'm simply

1133.28 --> 1138.2
reading the feelings and the way the

1136.34 --> 1140.24
people speak and then cross-referencing

1138.2 --> 1142.94
with every time I've seen that in that

1140.24 --> 1145.28
language to really understand the

1142.94 --> 1148.16
culture of what is happening

1145.28 --> 1149.96
and then sometimes I can get a glimpse

1148.16 --> 1152.059
really of like

1149.96 --> 1154.64
I can almost get inside their head of

1152.059 --> 1156.9189999999999
that moment and just understand what's

1154.64 --> 1159.98
happening

1156.919 --> 1162.7990000000002
and they're now still like I wouldn't

1159.98 --> 1165.44
have any kind of notice of what it

1162.799 --> 1169.0
actually is they're saying because even

1165.44 --> 1169.0
what they're saying might be just

1169.22 --> 1173.3600000000001
like not even about what they're

1171.5 --> 1175.9
thinking and

1173.36 --> 1175.8999999999999
it right

1177.86 --> 1180.52
what's this

1185.66 --> 1192.46
anyway I'm rambling

1189.14 --> 1192.46
I'll slow it down now

1195.679 --> 1198.5800000000002
foreign

1214.419 --> 1221.6200000000001
does the glass grow as we grow

1218.84 --> 1221.62
that's funny

1221.96 --> 1225.22
but yeah I guess

1225.62 --> 1230.4799999999998
I mean the higher your Consciousness the

1228.02 --> 1233.179
more you realize was already there you

1230.48 --> 1236.84
just start to see how it works so that

1233.179 --> 1239.0590000000002
glass definitely gets bigger because how

1236.84 --> 1244.059
it works doesn't really overall change

1239.059 --> 1244.059
the ego nature that's behind it still

1244.52 --> 1249.559
expresses itself the same

1247.28 --> 1252.08
the same balance

1249.559 --> 1253.3999999999999
so yeah the glass metaphorically does

1252.08 --> 1255.26
grow bigger the higher your

1253.4 --> 1257.48
Consciousness becomes

1255.26 --> 1260.799
happened

1257.48 --> 1260.799
hello Stevie Traveler

1278.1 --> 1282.829
[Music]

1299.48 --> 1310.819
foreign

1301.65 --> 1310.8190000000002
[Music]

1321.5 --> 1326.679
what are you talking about D Frank

1339.159 --> 1343.96
you're talking nonsensically dude

1351.679 --> 1354.64
foreign

1356.67 --> 1359.709
[Music]

1363.58 --> 1369.76
by the way and it's great I'm I'm not

1366.44 --> 1369.76
going back for a while

1370.1 --> 1376.52
I feel great

1372.32 --> 1378.9399999999998
I got no more stomach issues at all like

1376.52 --> 1378.94
at all

1383.26 --> 1390.1
it literally makes me feel like I'm in

1387.32 --> 1390.1
my 20s again

1394.69 --> 1397.769
[Music]

1402.26 --> 1407.36
okay you're out of here nonsense

1411.96 --> 1415.16
[Music]

1417.74 --> 1423.74
Healthy Living is the best yeah but only

1420.2 --> 1426.039
if you have a healthy mind to accompany

1423.74 --> 1426.039
that

1430.34 --> 1434.02
right that's the thing though

1434.059 --> 1438.74
if you're a dirty Grappler and you're

1436.76 --> 1440.84
just money money money and then you just

1438.74 --> 1442.46
like oh I need to take care of my help I

1440.84 --> 1444.98
don't feel great

1442.46 --> 1447.5
oh no yeah and then you get all the best

1444.98 --> 1451.22
supplements and all like

1447.5 --> 1452.36
therapy and massages and everything yeah

1451.22 --> 1455.0
guess what

1452.36 --> 1458.9799999999998
oh your body's in top condition but yeah

1455.0 --> 1458.98
that that wasn't the problem though

1460.4 --> 1465.679
all those things now only serve to

1463.1 --> 1467.78
distract you away from the core of the

1465.679 --> 1472.179
problem which is your spirit

1467.78 --> 1472.1789999999999
which is the reason why

1472.28 --> 1478.46
you keep feeling shitty

1474.98 --> 1481.7
and then that results in bodily

1478.46 --> 1483.559
anguish or that that sort of thing and

1481.7 --> 1485.179
then you blame the body well guess what

1483.559 --> 1488.1399999999999
you're an idiot

1485.179 --> 1488.14
you're ignorant

1498.5 --> 1506.0
and arguably you could say it's like an

1502.12 --> 1510.799
esoteric rule like the pure your spirit

1506.0 --> 1513.62
is by the true standard of God which it

1510.799 --> 1516.26
is not even really spoken or written

1513.62 --> 1518.4189999999999
it's just the way things are and it's

1516.26 --> 1520.76
palpable you will feel it you will know

1518.419 --> 1522.98
you will see

1520.76 --> 1525.26
and the more you become pure the more

1522.98 --> 1527.059
you will see how it is

1525.26 --> 1528.98
and there might still be like rose

1527.059 --> 1532.1589999999999
colored Darkly

1528.98 --> 1535.1
altered perception because of who you

1532.159 --> 1537.8600000000001
are compared to everybody else

1535.1 --> 1540.3799999999999
even as you become purer and higher

1537.86 --> 1542.0
conscious right because of who you are

1540.38 --> 1543.5590000000002
you might still see certain things

1542.0 --> 1545.059
slightly different from everybody else

1543.559 --> 1547.22
and that's why it's important to

1545.059 --> 1550.1589999999999
cross-reference everybody with everybody

1547.22 --> 1553.72
else with that

1550.159 --> 1553.72
in your estimations

1556.279 --> 1561.2
right

1558.86 --> 1564.1399999999999
now I'm losing track what was my point

1561.2 --> 1566.8600000000001
was that the point

1564.14 --> 1566.8600000000001
uh

1571.46 --> 1579.93
right you need to know what is

1575.779 --> 1582.2
right and just do that

1579.93 --> 1583.5800000000002
[Music]

1582.2 --> 1586.22
and then

1583.58 --> 1587.1999999999998
if you yeah no like I got my point back

1586.22 --> 1591.26
sorry

1587.2 --> 1593.659
then the pure you become the less your

1591.26 --> 1595.7
body actually will need because

1593.659 --> 1598.22
you get Mana

1595.7 --> 1601.76
you could call it that you get the

1598.22 --> 1603.98
energy from the Purity and that actually

1601.76 --> 1605.84
nourishes your body too and then you

1603.98 --> 1608.0
just need less

1605.84 --> 1610.24
and the purer you become the less you

1608.0 --> 1610.24
need

1614.779 --> 1620.6
you become more your body starts to

1617.36 --> 1623.36
function more efficiently basically and

1620.6 --> 1625.1
arguably that'll age you less as well

1623.36 --> 1627.26
if you can

1625.1 --> 1628.9399999999998
deal with the stresses and you might

1627.26 --> 1632.779
have a mechanism for that

1628.94 --> 1635.659
if you avoid it just for that then

1632.779 --> 1638.24
eventually fate will catch up with you

1635.659 --> 1641.419
because if you avoid stress altogether

1638.24 --> 1643.94
then you will not be trained you will

1641.419 --> 1647.0
not you will lose that interface yet you

1643.94 --> 1650.179
will not understand it anymore

1647.0 --> 1653.12
and then it may

1650.179 --> 1653.96
and close you because you lose sight of

1653.12 --> 1657.9399999999998
it

1653.96 --> 1657.94
talking all about this pure spirit

1663.5 --> 1670.22
all right and this is also my personal

1665.96 --> 1671.9
issue with for example Buddhism or what

1670.22 --> 1675.02
I've seen out there

1671.9 --> 1679.6000000000001
people that are like yeah no just don't

1675.02 --> 1679.6
just don't respond at all just don't

1680.96 --> 1684.64
basically ignore everything

1686.9 --> 1692.6000000000001
and what that yeah that may bring you

1689.659 --> 1695.48
that peace but it is effectively a

1692.6 --> 1699.4399999999998
decided form of ignorance

1695.48 --> 1702.2
and you may find peace but then you die

1699.44 --> 1704.539
as I like to say right that's that

1702.2 --> 1706.22
because then you lose track of what's

1704.539 --> 1709.48
really happening

1706.22 --> 1709.48
in certain ways

1710.299 --> 1717.74
and then the world encloses you you

1713.539 --> 1720.44
actually do become isolated and then

1717.74 --> 1722.9
you may not even see things coming

1720.44 --> 1725.3600000000001
so are you then just gonna oh well when

1722.9 --> 1727.8200000000002
I when they come for me then I just die

1725.36 --> 1730.9599999999998
like oh is that all

1727.82 --> 1730.96
still reasonable

1732.14 --> 1734.679
right

1736.4 --> 1741.5590000000002
well anybody with slightly Earthly

1739.64 --> 1743.2990000000002
perspective will think that like yeah no

1741.559 --> 1746.8999999999999
that's not really reasonable that's like

1743.299 --> 1749.9
a spiritual thing but what is then the

1746.9 --> 1752.24
point of that

1749.9 --> 1755.6200000000001
is it just like oh no they're just going

1752.24 --> 1755.6200000000001
to escape the world then

1759.559 --> 1766.22
is that really the purpose is that truly

1763.159 --> 1768.98
the purpose to just escape the world

1766.22 --> 1770.539
or is it only destined for those that

1768.98 --> 1773.74
really don't have any business here

1770.539 --> 1773.74
anymore that like

1775.399 --> 1779.84
that can't connect with their Spirit up

1778.1 --> 1782.539
properly with the world anymore are

1779.84 --> 1785.299
those supposed to escape because they

1782.539 --> 1787.34
would obviously feel reason during their

1785.299 --> 1789.3799999999999
life

1787.34 --> 1791.36
for wanting to go

1789.38 --> 1794.8600000000001
because it's like [ __ ] this world like

1791.36 --> 1794.86
this world is everything sucks

1795.08 --> 1798.62
like there's all these potential and

1797.059 --> 1802.82
nobody's using it it's only getting

1798.62 --> 1804.9799999999998
worse like what am I doing here right I

1802.82 --> 1808.279
imagine that those people would actually

1804.98 --> 1811.46
strive to escape the world spiritually

1808.279 --> 1814.46
and like argue yeah

1811.46 --> 1816.6200000000001
no longer reincarnate because what do

1814.46 --> 1821.3600000000001
they want here right nothing there's

1816.62 --> 1825.1399999999999
nothing left for them but everybody know

1821.36 --> 1827.4799999999998
so are these Buddhists then individuals

1825.14 --> 1830.1200000000001
that are like that

1827.48 --> 1833.14
that they really don't want anything

1830.12 --> 1833.1399999999999
from the world anymore

1837.98 --> 1843.08
or is it some weird Noble sacrifice

1841.34 --> 1844.76
drive that they isolate themselves

1843.08 --> 1848.1789999999999
because they think that that's the right

1844.76 --> 1850.419
thing to do for the world or God or

1848.179 --> 1850.419
something

1852.14 --> 1855.159
which one is it

1855.32 --> 1860.48
right I Ponder on these some these type

1858.26 --> 1863.0
of things sometimes

1860.48 --> 1864.8600000000001
anyway

1863.0 --> 1867.98
Ponder upon these types of things

1864.86 --> 1871.52
actually a lot more than oh what is Bill

1867.98 --> 1873.38
Gates doing or Sorrows or oh no that

1871.52 --> 1875.6589999999999
like no

1873.38 --> 1878.919
those people are not interesting

1875.659 --> 1878.919
actually barely

1879.559 --> 1886.1589999999999
they have a couple of unique talents

1883.7 --> 1889.8990000000001
and their life is pretty [ __ ] up and

1886.159 --> 1889.8990000000001
they ignore a lot of things

1890.899 --> 1899.059
and they have demonic impulses that they

1894.86 --> 1901.6999999999998
treat like pets

1899.059 --> 1904.22
that sometimes they need to feed but

1901.7 --> 1905.299
they don't they don't they are not that

1904.22 --> 1907.64
it's

1905.299 --> 1911.96
they are not really interesting people

1907.64 --> 1914.919
actually a lot of them are really boring

1911.96 --> 1914.919
did you know that

1914.96 --> 1919.24
they don't have any wisdom to share

1921.26 --> 1927.08
there a lot of them are kind of kooky

1924.62 --> 1928.6399999999999
are just really boring

1927.08 --> 1932.24
I mean

1928.64 --> 1934.76
why would you care about these people

1932.24 --> 1938.059
except for well yeah

1934.76 --> 1941.02
the challenges they have imposed upon us

1938.059 --> 1941.02
the rest of the world

1948.86 --> 1954.4599999999998
all right controls are very healthy yeah

1951.44 --> 1954.46
well they do their best

1955.82 --> 1960.799
to stay healthy at least and they can I

1958.76 --> 1964.179
mean they're they they don't have any

1960.799 --> 1964.179
money limitation so

1966.46 --> 1971.2
so yeah their bodies are relatively

1969.2 --> 1975.559
healthy but

1971.2 --> 1978.94
their minds are just com deranged

1975.559 --> 1978.94
and not getting any better

1995.6 --> 2001.84
I wonder some of them like almost keep

1999.32 --> 2003.1
parts of their own Consciousness like in

2001.84 --> 2005.1999999999998
prison

2003.1 --> 2008.74
and that

2005.2 --> 2011.8600000000001
if you just have traits and you suppress

2008.74 --> 2015.76
them for an ultimate goal well that

2011.86 --> 2017.86
internally starts deny it yeah

2015.76 --> 2019.12
and can like

2017.86 --> 2023.08
I've

2019.12 --> 2023.08
speculated speculation

2023.5 --> 2029.74
that if you do that too long

2026.799 --> 2031.6
and you well like these people that your

2029.74 --> 2034.98
internal Spirit could at some point just

2031.6 --> 2034.98
break out and kill you

2035.62 --> 2042.279
might get a massive like feedback

2040.32 --> 2044.9189999999999
shock

2042.279 --> 2047.2
to get you a heart attack

2044.919 --> 2050.02
that that is the internal spirit that

2047.2 --> 2051.46
has been like mercilessly godlessly

2050.02 --> 2054.94
suppressed

2051.46 --> 2056.859
and it at some point it builds counter

2054.94 --> 2058.599
strength it builds pressure and then at

2056.859 --> 2064.08
some point it breaks through and just

2058.599 --> 2064.0800000000004
kills you just like end it now back

2066.46 --> 2071.159
yeah

2068.619 --> 2071.159
dude

2074.02 --> 2078.7
right no matter how healthy they are

2077.159 --> 2081.879
[Music]

2078.7 --> 2083.74
or it'll seep through more slowly and

2081.879 --> 2088.2599999999998
just start to give massive health

2083.74 --> 2088.2599999999998
problems that that will not go away

2094.0 --> 2100.3
anyway

2096.03 --> 2102.099
[Music]

2100.3 --> 2105.1800000000003
hello James Mays good to see you

2102.099 --> 2105.1800000000003
classical homeopath

2117.94 --> 2123.28
if your mind is deranged it allows your

2120.76 --> 2125.5600000000004
body to be healthier

2123.28 --> 2126.73
what you mean when you don't take the

2125.56 --> 2129.96
weight

2126.73 --> 2129.96
[Music]

2130.0 --> 2135.28
when you reject

2131.8 --> 2137.5
actual spiritual responsibility

2135.28 --> 2139.92
yeah your body would probably be

2137.5 --> 2139.92
healthier

2142.66 --> 2152.2799999999997
but that poses another type of toll

2147.88 --> 2152.28
you literally become irresponsible

2152.619 --> 2157.06
okay that's the price there is always a

2155.8 --> 2159.4
price

2157.06 --> 2161.56
what do you want it to be

2159.4 --> 2164.32
no more weight

2161.56 --> 2167.859
or do you want to become spiritually

2164.32 --> 2170.46
irresponsible you know

2167.859 --> 2170.46
foreign

2173.4 --> 2179.76
spiritually irresponsible also means

2176.14 --> 2179.7599999999998
completely unreliable

2179.859 --> 2183.48
and that means isolation

2184.14 --> 2187.359
[Music]

2185.46 --> 2190.06
disconnection

2187.359 --> 2193.02
people will not understand you

2190.06 --> 2194.5099999999998
you will then no longer understand you

2193.02 --> 2197.38
now you're lost

2194.51 --> 2200.5
[Music]

2197.38 --> 2203.2000000000003
and that's when like the really creepy

2200.5 --> 2205.38
things can suddenly crawl in from the

2203.2 --> 2205.3799999999997
back

2205.72 --> 2210.9599999999996
and you can get really seriously

2207.82 --> 2210.96
possessed like a monster

2212.68 --> 2216.7799999999997
so

2213.94 --> 2216.78
don't do that

2221.26 --> 2228.94
I've experienced micro versions of that

2225.24 --> 2231.3999999999996
entropy cycle myself in my teens and I

2228.94 --> 2234.359
would actually become

2231.4 --> 2234.359
deranged

2234.52 --> 2240.22
in my mind I would always be pacifist

2237.04 --> 2242.859
but I would just become deranged

2240.22 --> 2244.9599999999996
by not taking responsibility he had a

2242.859 --> 2248.14
really severe corrupting influence on me

2244.96 --> 2250.96
so yeah I had to learn to stop doing

2248.14 --> 2254.6189999999997
that and actually take responsibility

2250.96 --> 2258.2200000000003
but yeah that was very miserable at

2254.619 --> 2260.52
first very tough now I can't stop doing

2258.22 --> 2260.52
it

2262.78 --> 2269.88
now actually taking the weight is

2266.38 --> 2269.88
what keeps me going

2273.16 --> 2278.8799999999997
but it's a spiritual weight that I carry

2275.92 --> 2282.7000000000003
I do not carry much like direct

2278.88 --> 2285.46
responsibility weight from out there

2282.7 --> 2288.52
concerning a job or a family at this

2285.46 --> 2290.76
point although I do kind of long for

2288.52 --> 2290.7599999999998
that

2292.0 --> 2295.9
I mean I've never been great at it but I

2294.16 --> 2299.56
want to try it out now I think that I

2295.9 --> 2305.1600000000003
might actually be able to just do it now

2299.56 --> 2305.16
and and like fluidly integrate even

2308.619 --> 2312.82
I mean certainly compared to a lot of

2311.44 --> 2315.64
other people and how they

2312.82 --> 2320.579
psychologically function out there

2315.64 --> 2320.5789999999997
I think that I could really be

2321.64 --> 2327.8199999999997
present myself as somebody that would be

2325.0 --> 2330.4
like where everybody wants that

2327.82 --> 2332.5
so I would be be wanted I think I can

2330.4 --> 2335.38
very much do that now

2332.5 --> 2337.599
if I have the right

2335.38 --> 2339.94
place to be

2337.599 --> 2343.119
with the right vision

2339.94 --> 2345.599
so that I can attain the right attitude

2343.119 --> 2345.599
right

2349.42 --> 2354.82
but

2350.8 --> 2358.44
now I'm just doing this

2354.82 --> 2358.44
glad Earth early bird show

2359.14 --> 2362.7599999999998
and the flatter of the debates

2366.339 --> 2372.7
and there's plenty weights to carry

2369.579 --> 2375.28
because people in this field yeah I mean

2372.7 --> 2378.64
it's the internet for one

2375.28 --> 2381.1600000000003
the whole weight situation works very

2378.64 --> 2382.48
differently here

2381.16 --> 2385.3199999999997
it's a different way of socially

2382.48 --> 2385.32
functioning it's

2386.38 --> 2391.2400000000002
more fluid

2388.18 --> 2393.2799999999997
more easy going overall and people are

2391.24 --> 2397.7999999999997
much more tolerant

2393.28 --> 2397.8
even though in ways they shouldn't be

2406.839 --> 2411.24
I'm grateful that this is what I'm doing

2408.46 --> 2411.2400000000002
yeah thanks man

2414.76 --> 2417.96
and I like doing it

2419.44 --> 2423.919
foreign

2420.78 --> 2423.9190000000003
[Music]

2426.16 --> 2432.8799999999997
I mean if I have a family and I could

2430.119 --> 2435.04
still do it I would still do it

2432.88 --> 2438.339
because I like doing it

2435.04 --> 2440.8
I mean in a way you guys are my friends

2438.339 --> 2444.099
it's a different form of friends it's

2440.8 --> 2448.8
through through the internet but

2444.099 --> 2452.46
it's it's better in a way

2448.8 --> 2452.46
more specific

2457.42 --> 2464.56
and with internet friends there's less

2460.359 --> 2466.9
like a hassle concerning Logistics

2464.56 --> 2469.839
like you have to

2466.9 --> 2471.88
pre-arrange a time for to meet somebody

2469.839 --> 2473.56
or something and they having a schedule

2471.88 --> 2476.88
and

2473.56 --> 2476.88
well there's a lot less of that

2476.92 --> 2482.36
on the internet

2477.92 --> 2482.36
[Music]

2488.14 --> 2494.68
like I've seen many friend circles break

2491.38 --> 2496.6600000000003
apart out there I've studied that

2494.68 --> 2499.2999999999997
even as a teen

2496.66 --> 2502.18
at going into my 20s

2499.3 --> 2504.2200000000003
I just noticed so many friend circles

2502.18 --> 2507.2799999999997
that would literally start falling apart

2504.22 --> 2508.9599999999996
because everybody got a job

2507.28 --> 2511.2000000000003
Etc and then nobody would have time

2508.96 --> 2511.2
anymore

2511.24 --> 2517.24
and then like it became such a hassle to

2513.76 --> 2519.4
just find a common date

2517.24 --> 2521.6189999999997
to meet

2519.4 --> 2522.52
and then eventually like they just give

2521.619 --> 2526.2400000000002
up

2522.52 --> 2529.3
and it'll see multiple friend circles

2526.24 --> 2532.8999999999996
like with my brother

2529.3 --> 2534.3390000000004
who did his own like uh sort of tabletop

2532.9 --> 2536.38
role playing games

2534.339 --> 2540.94
and

2536.38 --> 2544.1800000000003
other friends and friends from school

2540.94 --> 2548.579
like all the friend circles

2544.18 --> 2548.5789999999997
that always ended up happening

2555.92 --> 2562.38
[Music]

2558.339 --> 2567.1
it was very frustrating to me even

2562.38 --> 2567.1
[Music]

2569.32 --> 2572.92
right Wife and Kids you know it's not

2571.3 --> 2576.7200000000003
even about that

2572.92 --> 2576.7200000000003
it's just people's jobs alone

2587.5 --> 2592.359
and also with I guess smarter people

2589.9 --> 2594.88
they typically do get higher paying jobs

2592.359 --> 2596.92
that really takes their concentration so

2594.88 --> 2598.359
they then get so into it they just can't

2596.92 --> 2600.099
do anything else and they can't even

2598.359 --> 2602.44
remember

2600.099 --> 2605.38
they just they they've thrown everything

2602.44 --> 2608.52
away except for that job then

2605.38 --> 2608.52
that also happens

2614.92 --> 2621.16
especially in like team that in 20s

2618.52 --> 2623.68
transition when when you start careers

2621.16 --> 2626.22
and right

2623.68 --> 2626.22
so

2629.56 --> 2632.04
yeah

2632.44 --> 2634.68
foreign

2646.5 --> 2653.74
but it's it's weird isn't it just think

2649.9 --> 2655.7200000000003
about how this has formed over like the

2653.74 --> 2659.0789999999997
last hundred years or so

2655.72 --> 2661.54
how things have transitioned from

2659.079 --> 2664.54
there was no internet it wasn't even

2661.54 --> 2669.599
really phones maybe a couple of phones

2664.54 --> 2669.599
the rich people like early 20th century

2670.0 --> 2675.579
and

2672.04 --> 2677.5
everybody would just have friends in

2675.579 --> 2679.48
their in the neighborhood

2677.5 --> 2682.619
and you would like go to a pub together

2679.48 --> 2682.619
or do other stuff

2683.859 --> 2688.48
and that's the people you knew then and

2686.5 --> 2692.02
you would have wife and kids and then

2688.48 --> 2696.0
yeah now there's the internet and that's

2692.02 --> 2699.46
really helpful because the working

2696.0 --> 2701.92
situation has become like rapidly more

2699.46 --> 2703.7200000000003
complicated compared to a hundred years

2701.92 --> 2707.02
ago

2703.72 --> 2708.9399999999996
and that really gradually became well to

2707.02 --> 2710.74
this point where base basically it

2708.94 --> 2713.98
consumes all your time

2710.74 --> 2715.359
it's really strenuous

2713.98 --> 2719.339
to even

2715.359 --> 2719.339
keep focused on a lot of these things

2719.38 --> 2723.88
and

2721.48 --> 2726.54
a negative influence on your person a

2723.88 --> 2729.28
lot more than compared to typical jobs

2726.54 --> 2731.619
way back then when everything was much

2729.28 --> 2734.8190000000004
more natural

2731.619 --> 2734.819
you could just be yourself

2735.04 --> 2740.68
reasonable

2737.14 --> 2743.3799999999997
the job would be reasonable right now it

2740.68 --> 2746.14
isn't and that really can you imagine

2743.38 --> 2748.3
that we would have to work still in this

2746.14 --> 2750.8799999999997
world out there on that level like

2748.3 --> 2753.3390000000004
working at Amazon or something right

2750.88 --> 2754.54
and there would be no internet to have

2753.339 --> 2757.96
friends

2754.54 --> 2760.96
everybody would be [ __ ]

2757.96 --> 2764.5
you would just be doing the slave job

2760.96 --> 2766.42
and not having time to connect up with

2764.5 --> 2769.66
anybody ever

2766.42 --> 2773.859
except maybe at home if you're lucky

2769.66 --> 2776.98
that will be so [ __ ] right

2773.859 --> 2779.52
but that's because jobs have become so

2776.98 --> 2779.52
strenuous

2779.74 --> 2784.3799999999997
now compared to a hundred years ago

2784.42 --> 2787.859
so how did this happen

2791.619 --> 2794.92
it's like

2793.18 --> 2799.5989999999997
that's

2794.92 --> 2803.98
it must be because of like banking

2799.599 --> 2806.6800000000003
the banking have the financialization

2803.98 --> 2809.14
of Labor and

2806.68 --> 2812.339
and corporations

2809.14 --> 2812.339
have just become

2813.18 --> 2821.56
parasitical on the actual Workforce that

2816.52 --> 2823.599
that drives them that gave them all that

2821.56 --> 2826.72
and it's getting worse and worse

2823.599 --> 2829.42
becoming intangible well the funny thing

2826.72 --> 2831.9399999999996
is if you now completely go out of the

2829.42 --> 2834.339
system like for example Owen Benjamin

2831.94 --> 2836.5
yeah and a lot of people out there

2834.339 --> 2839.38
homesteaders and all that

2836.5 --> 2840.94
and they built their own little isolated

2839.38 --> 2843.2200000000003
economy

2840.94 --> 2845.079
well that then starts to work kind of

2843.22 --> 2847.54
like what it was like a hundred years

2845.079 --> 2852.8390000000004
ago yeah you have to work

2847.54 --> 2852.839
but it it's less strenuous in ways

2852.94 --> 2857.56
and it's not unnatural and you just get

2855.76 --> 2860.0400000000004
a lot of energy from it and then it all

2857.56 --> 2860.04
works

2861.22 --> 2867.0989999999997
so if that works kind of roughly like it

2863.8 --> 2870.88
would 100 years ago then that means that

2867.099 --> 2875.38
the financialization is the cause of the

2870.88 --> 2878.8
degeneration of the working conditions

2875.38 --> 2882.54
it maybe it's just a correlation but

2878.8 --> 2882.54
the pattern is distinctly there

2887.8 --> 2893.5600000000004
so it's actually the ability to just

2890.88 --> 2896.5
financialize and gain enormous riches

2893.56 --> 2901.119
that has caused so much

2896.5 --> 2904.06
terrible working conditions that's

2901.119 --> 2907.119
so literally engaging working in that

2904.06 --> 2910.42
sort of system is what makes these

2907.119 --> 2913.1400000000003
people so stinking rich and is why your

2910.42 --> 2913.14
life sucks

2916.48 --> 2919.48
foreign

2922.3 --> 2926.059
[Music]

2926.579 --> 2933.76
ER I I didn't really work as a jeweler I

2930.88 --> 2936.579
I was a Goldsmith I never like worked in

2933.76 --> 2938.7400000000002
a jewel store or worked for

2936.579 --> 2940.9
somebody that would

2938.74 --> 2943.0
like that

2940.9 --> 2946.48
and yes I did have a lot of free time

2943.0 --> 2951.52
when I was goldsmithing on my own

2946.48 --> 2954.04
but I also had money from my inheritance

2951.52 --> 2957.06
so I didn't actually have to work I was

2954.04 --> 2957.06
actually kind of a

2957.099 --> 2962.2000000000003
in a luxurious position back then also

2960.339 --> 2964.24
yeah because if you have finances well

2962.2 --> 2965.3799999999997
then you can get materials very easy so

2964.24 --> 2968.319
it was just

2965.38 --> 2972.06
kind of letting my inspiration go

2968.319 --> 2972.06
and getting all these things done

2972.16 --> 2976.18
that I would never do now

2974.619 --> 2979.2400000000002
because I don't have the money for that

2976.18 --> 2981.339
now it's just like oh whatever the

2979.24 --> 2985.2999999999997
customer wants and then I that's all

2981.339 --> 2987.7599999999998
that is it that's what I could get then

2985.3 --> 2990.8390000000004
could never just make something and then

2987.76 --> 2990.8390000000004
see if I can sell it

2990.94 --> 2993.48
anyway

2994.78 --> 2999.5400000000004
a jeweler yeah what's wrong with that

3001.02 --> 3008.88
oh no you a Jew in Jewels oh no yeah

3006.24 --> 3011.18
I've met some really badass Jews

3008.88 --> 3011.1800000000003
actually

3012.359 --> 3021.359
as as a Goldsmith

3015.72 --> 3025.3799999999997
like I I actually had one make use a

3021.359 --> 3030.24
printed gold for very specific links in

3025.38 --> 3033.3
a multi gold ring that I made

3030.24 --> 3035.2799999999997
for yeah as wedding rings for a good

3033.3 --> 3036.6600000000003
friend of mine

3035.28 --> 3039.7200000000003
awesome

3036.66 --> 3041.0989999999997
Jews are awesome dude the ones that

3039.72 --> 3042.48
actually

3041.099 --> 3046.38
like

3042.48 --> 3049.92
aren't just sniveling freaks

3046.38 --> 3051.2400000000002
right I mean most Jews that I've met are

3049.92 --> 3053.4
pretty awesome actually

3051.24 --> 3056.5789999999997
except well

3053.4 --> 3060.0
it gets they get really grapply when it

3056.579 --> 3061.2000000000003
gets near bankers and when it gets near

3060.0 --> 3064.079
Media

3061.2 --> 3067.14
those kind of suck

3064.079 --> 3072.8
but pretty like the Jeweler Jews are

3067.14 --> 3076.14
[ __ ] awesome dude they are like Sharp

3072.8 --> 3078.599
morally very stable

3076.14 --> 3079.92
like awesome

3078.599 --> 3085.4
so

3079.92 --> 3085.4
write it on the Phantom where's the duet

3087.359 --> 3092.0
really

3089.46 --> 3092.0
so

3095.94 --> 3102.2000000000003
did I ever get interested in mechanical

3098.4 --> 3103.98
watches no I mean I find it fascinating

3102.2 --> 3107.0989999999997
[Music]

3103.98 --> 3108.54
the the quality of the craftsmanship

3107.099 --> 3110.7000000000003
I've seen

3108.54 --> 3114.7799999999997
yeah watchmakers

3110.7 --> 3117.1189999999997
like on the goldsmithing uh

3114.78 --> 3119.52
school that I went to there was

3117.119 --> 3120.96
watchmaking as well and I did I did

3119.52 --> 3123.119
actually hang around with that just to

3120.96 --> 3125.64
see like what they were doing

3123.119 --> 3128.76
I did I do like it I do like how

3125.64 --> 3131.16
engineering it is

3128.76 --> 3133.2000000000003
but I am not interested in doing that

3131.16 --> 3138.24
myself

3133.2 --> 3139.5
it's very time consuming and boring not

3138.24 --> 3142.5
my thing

3139.5 --> 3142.5
foreign

3145.2 --> 3151.2599999999998
but I definitely respect the people that

3149.04 --> 3153.859
do that

3151.26 --> 3153.8590000000004
absolutely

3158.76 --> 3163.079
right but I'm not really a watch guy

3160.859 --> 3165.18
anyway never was

3163.079 --> 3167.4
oh no that's not true I did wear a watch

3165.18 --> 3169.9199999999996
like

3167.4 --> 3171.96
pretty much to the end of my teens and

3169.92 --> 3174.92
then I was like

3171.96 --> 3174.92
nah

3175.44 --> 3181.8
I basically stopped what using a watch

3178.319 --> 3184.8
because I wanted to just know the time

3181.8 --> 3187.92
in my mind my mother never needed a

3184.8 --> 3190.6800000000003
watch she always very she was like

3187.92 --> 3192.54
trying to figure out what time it was

3190.68 --> 3195.2999999999997
just in her mind

3192.54 --> 3197.7
she was pretty good at it

3195.3 --> 3199.6800000000003
I wasn't when I was young but I

3197.7 --> 3201.5989999999997
basically at some point decided like no

3199.68 --> 3203.46
I'm not going to be dependent on looking

3201.599 --> 3205.7000000000003
at some device to tell me the time

3203.46 --> 3205.7
anymore

3205.92 --> 3211.02
unless I just woke up or something right

3209.7 --> 3213.18
but

3211.02 --> 3215.7
and so I stopped using a watch and then

3213.18 --> 3217.859
yeah I've never been like oh I I don't

3215.7 --> 3220.14
need a watch anymore I go to mobile no I

3217.859 --> 3222.72
don't have that either

3220.14 --> 3225.42
I don't have a smartphone

3222.72 --> 3229.819
I don't take my phone with me

3225.42 --> 3229.819
I just have to know what time it is

3231.359 --> 3234.98
so I keep track of it in my mind

3235.079 --> 3240.7400000000002
what kind of watch did I wear uh Swatch

3238.319 --> 3240.74
thing

3247.92 --> 3255.1800000000003
I like I didn't like digital watches

3252.78 --> 3257.1600000000003
I like digital alarm clocks though I did

3255.18 --> 3260.2799999999997
like those even though they made a

3257.16 --> 3262.2599999999998
shitty noise but at least they work

3260.28 --> 3265.88
but not on my arm

3262.26 --> 3265.88
then I wanted the actual

3265.92 --> 3270.02
uh analog watch

3274.38 --> 3282.76
right I haven't worn a watch in ages

3309.96 --> 3314.88
thank you thank you so much LSG that's

3313.14 --> 3318.2599999999998
awesome

3314.88 --> 3318.26
this is very helpful

3323.28 --> 3327.8
yeah I'm gonna go out for groceries

3325.2 --> 3327.7999999999997
after this

3328.38 --> 3333.38
get some

3330.66 --> 3333.3799999999997
decent dinner

3334.74 --> 3338.2999999999997
yeah thank you so much for the support

3346.14 --> 3349.7999999999997
I'm yeah and by the way we made it

3348.359 --> 3353.04
through

3349.8 --> 3355.7400000000002
I dropped alcohol on the way I'm I'm

3353.04 --> 3357.9
really gonna see if if that's going to

3355.74 --> 3360.5589999999997
change like how this financially all

3357.9 --> 3360.559
works now

3366.9 --> 3371.099
because yeah the last month has been

3369.119 --> 3373.619
quite strenuous

3371.099 --> 3377.54
financially

3373.619 --> 3377.54
so let's see if I can get out of this

3395.52 --> 3398.52
no

3396.96 --> 3402.319
huh

3398.52 --> 3402.319
that's cool for Casey

3404.7 --> 3408.72
does the cold weather one make me want

3407.16 --> 3411.5
to no I don't want to drink anymore

3408.72 --> 3411.5
actually

3415.38 --> 3420.839
I mean it makes me want to drink more

3417.54 --> 3424.44
warm and warm mint tea that's for dude

3420.839 --> 3427.7599999999998
I've been like drinking so much minty in

3424.44 --> 3427.76
the last few days it's crazy

3428.78 --> 3434.88
and also yeah with the cold it the tea

3432.72 --> 3437.839
itself gets colder quicker and that

3434.88 --> 3437.839
that's annoying

3443.28 --> 3448.6400000000003
you meant earlier what do you mean you

3445.74 --> 3448.64
mean last month

3450.599 --> 3454.1600000000003
what make me want to drink more

3455.339 --> 3460.819
no

3457.2 --> 3460.819
not particularly no

3464.339 --> 3470.599
I mean overall drinking is much more

3467.4 --> 3470.599
pleasant when it's warmer

3496.22 --> 3502.3799999999997
whiskey bill was 45 a bottle

3500.16 --> 3505.2
okay

3502.38 --> 3507.1800000000003
that's pretty expensive

3505.2 --> 3510.2599999999998
but still yeah it all depends on how

3507.18 --> 3510.2599999999998
long you're going to do with that

3511.68 --> 3519.0
for me it was roughly six euros a day

3516.42 --> 3520.44
or that's what it's become

3519.0 --> 3524.16
it was

3520.44 --> 3524.819
like a year ago it was not that exp it

3524.16 --> 3528.319
was

3524.819 --> 3528.319
a euro 70.

3531.119 --> 3536.059
per bottle instead of two

3533.46 --> 3536.059
right

3544.5 --> 3548.96
so yeah that should add up I know

3550.559 --> 3556.2000000000003
but then again also

3553.2 --> 3558.7799999999997
I'm probably gonna eat slightly more

3556.2 --> 3562.2799999999997
because yeah drinking that beer was

3558.78 --> 3562.28
basically like a meal

3563.76 --> 3567.7200000000003
so

3565.38 --> 3571.819
it's not like I'm just getting all that

3567.72 --> 3571.819
money and and it's not gonna be

3572.579 --> 3579.98
redirected

3575.04 --> 3579.98
I will see anyway I'm feeling great

3583.88 --> 3587.289
[Music]

3600.059 --> 3605.099
right so yeah

3602.66 --> 3607.5
yesterday's letter of debate was pretty

3605.099 --> 3609.78
interesting

3607.5 --> 3614.18
it got cut short though in the after

3609.78 --> 3614.1800000000003
show because yeah Nathan's computer

3614.28 --> 3619.76
crashed he was like crash testing it

3616.859 --> 3619.7599999999998
after that point

3623.099 --> 3626.6400000000003
but at least the live show just worked

3625.02 --> 3629.42
so that was cool

3626.64 --> 3629.42
uh

3635.64 --> 3638.24
all right

3638.46 --> 3644.52
yeah Jim Bob

3641.46 --> 3646.7400000000002
was live that was pretty cool

3644.52 --> 3648.66
uh

3646.74 --> 3651.24
outside of that I've been yeah I've been

3648.66 --> 3652.2599999999998
playing Baldur's Gate or the police gay

3651.24 --> 3654.859
too

3652.26 --> 3654.8590000000004
a lot

3657.059 --> 3661.6800000000003
like just some it's really bizarre

3660.24 --> 3664.3799999999997
because

3661.68 --> 3667.319
I'm watching it now with more detail

3664.38 --> 3669.859
than it was like when I first started

3667.319 --> 3669.859
playing it

3671.099 --> 3676.5
because like the story of it is really

3674.099 --> 3679.76
[ __ ] creepy actually

3676.5 --> 3679.76
in a lot of ways

3681.059 --> 3686.2200000000003
it's just like pretty bizarre

3684.119 --> 3689.1600000000003
playing through it again and now with

3686.22 --> 3691.799
another just

3689.16 --> 3694.8799999999997
trying to look at it as like somebody

3691.799 --> 3697.38
that wasn't me would see it

3694.88 --> 3699.42
so yeah studying just I'm always

3697.38 --> 3702.02
studying

3699.42 --> 3702.02
anyway

3707.64 --> 3711.66
feel like you already made it through

3709.2 --> 3715.2
the winter yeah in a way

3711.66 --> 3718.319
I mean January is like

3715.2 --> 3720.5989999999997
a pretty annoying month

3718.319 --> 3724.2
saw a grocery store but yeah I know you

3720.599 --> 3726.98

3767.7 --> 3770.54
we'll see

3833.4 --> 3836.42
right anyway

3837.059 --> 3843.78
still got

3839.819 --> 3847.46
another 40 minutes or so to go

3843.78 --> 3847.46
I can talk about whatever

3862.98 --> 3867.859
I've been watching Owen Benjamin before

3864.9 --> 3867.859
the show by the way

3868.44 --> 3871.819
before I get to an episode

3902.46 --> 3905.0
foreign

3943.22 --> 3950.54
so yeah guys come on

3946.14 --> 3950.54
give me something give me something

3951.9 --> 3957.14
I pretty much shared everything

3954.42 --> 3957.14
I mean

3960.75 --> 3966.839
[Music]

3964.52 --> 3969.2599999999998
just what do you want to know what do

3966.839 --> 3969.2599999999998
you want to know

3969.54 --> 3974.7799999999997
ask me a question

3972.24 --> 3974.7799999999997
come on

3978.21 --> 3982.38
[Music]

3981.0 --> 3984.96
what are your thoughts what are your

3982.38 --> 3987.059
Reflections what do you think about what

3984.96 --> 3990.539
I'm talking about do you think

3987.059 --> 3992.52
that it's safe talking about

3990.539 --> 3994.7990000000004
like the subject that I talked about

3992.52 --> 3997.1
yesterday

3994.799 --> 3998.64
because I sure don't

3997.1 --> 4001.94
[Music]

3998.64 --> 4005.18
but in this world it just seems like

4001.94 --> 4007.579
people don't even see it

4005.18 --> 4011.9199999999996
don't even see

4007.579 --> 4011.92
the Potential Threat of such knowledge

4017.599 --> 4021.8590000000004
because I'm not giving it to them I'm

4019.4 --> 4024.2000000000003
not like oh this is how you corrupt it

4021.859 --> 4026.839
oh look oh here's the blueprint on how

4024.2 --> 4029.839
to be a complete [ __ ] psychopath oh

4026.839 --> 4032.72
that's who we have to worry about yeah

4029.839 --> 4035.9
yeah yeah but you're actually literally

4032.72 --> 4037.52
programming people that listen to you to

4035.9 --> 4042.079
be that

4037.52 --> 4045.079
oh oh you didn't realize that

4042.079 --> 4047.2400000000002
oh yeah that's what happens

4045.079 --> 4048.6800000000003
get really intense and you try to warn

4047.24 --> 4050.5389999999998
somebody about something and then

4048.68 --> 4052.16
confront them with information they

4050.539 --> 4054.7990000000004
absolutely cannot deal with then they

4052.16 --> 4057.6189999999997
literally become traumatized by it

4054.799 --> 4059.119
just as if it were to really happen and

4057.619 --> 4061.28
then they're

4059.119 --> 4064.6400000000003
they're undergoing that influence it's

4061.28 --> 4067.099
gonna have a grip on them now

4064.64 --> 4068.37
leading potentially to the long-term

4067.099 --> 4069.98
slide

4068.37 --> 4072.5
[Music]

4069.98 --> 4074.299
so

4072.5 --> 4076.16
yeah it's happening a lot out there

4074.299 --> 4079.66
though

4076.16 --> 4079.66
like it's called fear porn

4083.0 --> 4086.839
although yeah there are some really

4084.619 --> 4090.799
[ __ ] nasty people out there as well I

4086.839 --> 4094.66
mean I personally cannot deny that but

4090.799 --> 4094.66
just harping on about it

4095.66 --> 4100.88
that's not gonna help it that's or well

4099.14 --> 4104.1990000000005
that's not gonna help against it that's

4100.88 --> 4104.1990000000005
actually going to help for it

4107.299 --> 4114.62
right because you got to realize that

4110.299 --> 4116.54
like with that real evil [ __ ]

4114.62 --> 4119.239
and you're really evil you want

4116.54 --> 4122.92
everybody to know you're really evil

4119.239 --> 4122.919999999999
because otherwise what's the point

4125.0 --> 4130.46
right but you don't want to be liable or

4127.52 --> 4134.799000000001
like have that proof so what do you do

4130.46 --> 4134.799
you spread rumors about it

4137.12 --> 4144.04
and then people fear you

4140.6 --> 4144.04
but they don't have proof

4145.699 --> 4147.699
um

4155.179 --> 4161.12
who's the black beard meant oh right the

4159.259 --> 4163.64
the black bearded man

4161.12 --> 4167.62
the man in Black you could just call him

4163.64 --> 4167.62
a man in Black but not a suit

4169.04 --> 4175.54
foreign

4171.279 --> 4175.540000000001
it was more like a dress

4175.94 --> 4182.299
you could also call him like

4179.259 --> 4184.339
yeah Black dressed Santa Claus or

4182.299 --> 4185.839
something he he was not like a skinny

4184.339 --> 4191.239
man or anything

4185.839 --> 4193.88
and he had glasses it was very bearded

4191.239 --> 4196.16
basically only see the top of his face

4193.88 --> 4199.28
with the glasses

4196.16 --> 4204.08
they had the sort of black

4199.28 --> 4206.239
almost veil-like hat on two

4204.08 --> 4208.28
it was all very weird

4206.239 --> 4209.718999999999
but that figure

4208.28 --> 4213.44
is

4209.719 --> 4215.96
an entity or yeah

4213.44 --> 4217.94
that's

4215.96 --> 4220.219
it's called it's really complicated

4217.94 --> 4223.28
because I think that

4220.219 --> 4224.96
may have been like my personification of

4223.28 --> 4227.9
God

4224.96 --> 4230.26
As I understood it

4227.9 --> 4230.259999999999
because

4230.9 --> 4236.48
like he does

4233.08 --> 4239.199
on many occasions like he always answers

4236.48 --> 4239.199
honestly

4241.4 --> 4246.139999999999
and he's brilliant

4244.82 --> 4249.739
but

4246.14 --> 4251.96
some of the feelings that drove him

4249.739 --> 4254.718999999999
because he did have feelings they

4251.96 --> 4258.02
couldn't sense that in that experience

4254.719 --> 4260.659
they were not like it didn't it wasn't

4258.02 --> 4262.580000000001
that it wasn't trustworthy to that level

4260.659 --> 4265.099999999999
it's like

4262.58 --> 4266.719
it's part of a challenge it's so

4265.1 --> 4270.26
complicated guys

4266.719 --> 4272.84
but every time he appears it's a giant

4270.26 --> 4275.62
Monumental sign to me that it is a dark

4272.84 --> 4275.62
World experience

4283.1 --> 4288.679
it might potentially be like what would

4286.28 --> 4291.62
be considered a demon or something that

4288.679 --> 4294.26
slipped in when it happened in 2017

4291.62 --> 4296.42
which is the distinct first time where

4294.26 --> 4299.42
he literally like announced his presence

4296.42 --> 4302.12
and try to prove to me that he was God

4299.42 --> 4304.9400000000005
through his might over the simulation

4302.12 --> 4307.46
but I just knew like I'm not that stupid

4304.94 --> 4309.5599999999995
dude

4307.46 --> 4311.6
but still he

4309.56 --> 4314.4800000000005
acted

4311.6 --> 4317.06
as I like

4314.48 --> 4319.419999999999
he mostly seen benevolent it was so

4317.06 --> 4319.42
complicated

4320.36 --> 4324.96
I don't even know how to describe what

4322.699 --> 4328.089999999999
it is like

4324.96 --> 4328.09
[Music]

4328.4 --> 4335.42
he served the purpose

4331.699 --> 4337.5199999999995
but it's both both male level and and

4335.42 --> 4340.46
benevolent it

4337.52 --> 4343.659000000001
I can't explain I can't I couldn't

4340.46 --> 4343.659
pinpoint it

4346.219 --> 4351.08
I mean through through yeah black

4348.98 --> 4353.959999999999
bearded man

4351.08 --> 4356.36
he was also the one that literally when

4353.96 --> 4358.52
I was a little kid or at least in the

4356.36 --> 4361.58
vision I was a little kid

4358.52 --> 4364.219
forced me or like really pushed me to

4361.58 --> 4365.84
drink blood which is like something I

4364.219 --> 4367.699
didn't even want to do so that was also

4365.84 --> 4369.860000000001
the black bearded man right I mean that

4367.699 --> 4372.379999999999
can be good

4369.86 --> 4374.299999999999
it's so weird

4372.38 --> 4377.6
but other times

4374.3 --> 4379.46
in situa like he's in my vision he

4377.6 --> 4382.400000000001
warned me

4379.46 --> 4384.9800000000005
that coffee would be my death

4382.4 --> 4386.96
like literally like

4384.98 --> 4389.36
in the kitchen black bearded man

4386.96 --> 4392.3
standing right next to it pointing at it

4389.36 --> 4395.659
or well not Point basically

4392.3 --> 4398.360000000001
nudging at it like

4395.659 --> 4402.879999999999
you really want to keep doing that

4398.36 --> 4402.88
so he did warn me on occasion

4404.36 --> 4408.5599999999995
I don't know man I don't know I don't

4406.88 --> 4412.82
know what it what he is

4408.56 --> 4414.92
my healer said that that he was not like

4412.82 --> 4417.62
not trustworthy at least he confirmed

4414.92 --> 4420.1990000000005
that and that

4417.62 --> 4422.42
The Entity that entities basically has

4420.199 --> 4425.239
gone away

4422.42 --> 4427.6990000000005
he even suggested that it might be like

4425.239 --> 4430.718999999999
a deceased person that he was really

4427.699 --> 4433.46
that person and that in spirit form

4430.719 --> 4435.14
after death he lingered because he was

4433.46 --> 4437.42
actually in her life a really evil

4435.14 --> 4441.1990000000005
person and that he basically just

4437.42 --> 4443.3
slipped in when I did that and arguably

4441.199 --> 4445.639999999999
the Jesuit guy who was the one that

4443.3 --> 4448.28
actually gave me that stuff

4445.64 --> 4451.46
so that I would enter that

4448.28 --> 4453.86
he seemed to have

4451.46 --> 4456.679
brought him in

4453.86 --> 4459.38
like to meet me

4456.679 --> 4461.4800000000005
in that experience

4459.38 --> 4464.4400000000005
but he might have been like an actual

4461.48 --> 4464.44
deceased person

4464.48 --> 4469.48
that had not

4466.58 --> 4472.1
like pretty recently died or something

4469.48 --> 4474.94
mysterious as [ __ ] everything about his

4472.1 --> 4474.9400000000005
to me is like

4476.239 --> 4482.36
like this happened like 25 years ago and

4480.219 --> 4485.62
and still

4482.36 --> 4485.62
I'm not sure

4502.1 --> 4507.5
absolutely On Target this is how they

4504.8 --> 4509.900000000001
work and what exactly do that's

4507.5 --> 4513.38
wait that's something you said six

4509.9 --> 4516.82
minutes ago wait is my chat dead again

4513.38 --> 4516.82
this is just YouTube

4521.659 --> 4526.219
no it is dead

4524.239 --> 4529.218999999999
people are not talking for six minutes

4526.219 --> 4529.219
goody

4530.06 --> 4535.219
right but then again I am talking about

4532.64 --> 4536.659000000001
like Vision stuff and that does kind of

4535.219 --> 4539.86
make you

4536.659 --> 4539.86
turn inward I guess

4543.1 --> 4549.4400000000005
bring you into a dream state as well to

4547.219 --> 4551.9
try to compare it

4549.44 --> 4553.099999999999
figure out what that is that I'm

4551.9 --> 4555.0199999999995
describing

4553.1 --> 4556.400000000001
maybe you're wondering like what it

4555.02 --> 4558.7390000000005
would feel like

4556.4 --> 4561.679
compared to your normal state that

4558.739 --> 4563.239
you're at or if you had an experience in

4561.679 --> 4567.04
your past

4563.239 --> 4567.04
if it was the same as that

4588.8 --> 4593.84
you were wondering okay hello Bill Nye

4591.56 --> 4597.159000000001
the science denier

4593.84 --> 4597.159000000001
wondering about what

4606.739 --> 4612.699
really Matthew Hall

4610.04 --> 4612.699
okay

4613.82 --> 4617.86
that is quite freaky

4627.62 --> 4631.64
yeah a long time to say hello welcome

4629.84 --> 4633.860000000001
back

4631.64 --> 4635.42
hope you're doing okay I mean that's a

4633.86 --> 4639.199
pretty messed up dream

4635.42 --> 4641.78
right but it also does happen logically

4639.199 --> 4646.82
in response to

4641.78 --> 4649.699
reading hearing out about it a lot right

4646.82 --> 4651.98
I mean it's literally logical according

4649.699 --> 4654.259999999999
to basic psychology

4651.98 --> 4655.94
that if you're watching videos where

4654.26 --> 4658.58
they talk about blood drinking and

4655.94 --> 4662.12
vampirism in the real world the torture

4658.58 --> 4665.9
it with you that you're gonna have then

4662.12 --> 4667.5199999999995
that as a theme potentially woven into

4665.9 --> 4671.42
your Dreamscape

4667.52 --> 4673.580000000001
you gotta realize that yeah I mean

4671.42 --> 4674.78
you can't just oh I'm just doing this in

4673.58 --> 4677.239
real life

4674.78 --> 4680.92
you know and then my dreams oh no I'm

4677.239 --> 4680.919999999999
free oh really you are

4681.44 --> 4688.58
I mean why don't you ask FBI agents that

4684.92 --> 4691.46
literally go on the internet to find

4688.58 --> 4693.44
child molesters and child porn dealers

4691.46 --> 4696.14
why don't you ask them about their

4693.44 --> 4699.159
dreams okay

4696.14 --> 4699.159000000001
they know

4699.44 --> 4705.08
so

4700.699 --> 4708.159
don't get into that [ __ ] because it's

4705.08 --> 4708.159
gonna invade you

4734.54 --> 4739.06
only had some paranormal experiences

4740.96 --> 4744.219
to pick me up

4745.36 --> 4753.0199999999995
2016 and as a kid in Idaho okay

4749.92 --> 4756.63
what kind of paranormal experiences are

4753.02 --> 4759.869000000001
you talking about blue pill devolution

4756.63 --> 4759.869
[Music]

4773.659 --> 4778.039
foreign

4774.85 --> 4778.039000000001
[Music]

4837.739 --> 4841.0
that's creepy

4841.219 --> 4846.9800000000005
I mean footsteps slapping noises and all

4844.219 --> 4849.159
that that sounds like a poltergeist-like

4846.98 --> 4849.159
effect

4850.4 --> 4854.98
you have any teenage daughters

4876.02 --> 4881.900000000001
do you think psychosis is some dude

4880.28 --> 4883.94
yes

4881.9 --> 4886.299999999999
absolutely thank you orange it was a

4883.94 --> 4886.299999999999
good question

4886.88 --> 4890.08
a little kid okay

4890.719 --> 4895.82
right oh blue build Evolution it might

4893.0 --> 4898.76
be your Poltergeist effect I have I

4895.82 --> 4901.179
still do have Poltergeist effects

4898.76 --> 4901.179
still

4903.14 --> 4907.76
it's

4904.46 --> 4909.14
it's basically like a side effect

4907.76 --> 4912.88
of

4909.14 --> 4912.88
having an intense spirit

4913.1 --> 4917.6
especially a struggling spirit

4915.98 --> 4919.58
right

4917.6 --> 4922.219
anyway yeah orange peel very good

4919.58 --> 4925.699
question there I think psychosis

4922.219 --> 4928.4
sometimes misdiagnosed

4925.699 --> 4930.259999999999
that people are experiencing it entering

4928.4 --> 4932.719
some kind of other dimension yes out of

4930.26 --> 4935.719
body experiences is what they are

4932.719 --> 4937.82
the problem with psychosis

4935.719 --> 4940.76
is not that they've experienced it is

4937.82 --> 4942.799999999999
that they don't know what to do with it

4940.76 --> 4945.9800000000005
or that they get really confused about

4942.8 --> 4948.58
reality because of it that's the actual

4945.98 --> 4948.58
psychosis

4949.82 --> 4957.199
but the problem is is that in Psychiatry

4953.12 --> 4960.199
typically if somebody has Visions or

4957.199 --> 4962.719
they just say oh that's that's Madness

4960.199 --> 4968.139999999999
no it's not

4962.719 --> 4968.14
but you can't go mad because of it

4969.98 --> 4973.19
[Music]

4975.86 --> 4981.98
to yeah usually when you're in that

4978.739 --> 4985.58
state you're more delicate so

4981.98 --> 4987.86
you can actually get spiritually damaged

4985.58 --> 4991.04
there

4987.86 --> 4993.08
that much is true but just having that

4991.04 --> 4995.42
such experience doesn't is not what

4993.08 --> 4997.88
psychosis technically is psychosis is

4995.42 --> 5000.1
literally losing track

4997.88 --> 5003.219
no longer being able to distinguish

5000.1 --> 5006.34
which one is the reality

5003.219 --> 5007.96
right right and so if you then this is

5006.34 --> 5010.6
typically what can happen through

5007.96 --> 5012.28
serious psychosis if you in real life

5010.6 --> 5013.900000000001
you're very well behaved you just know

5012.28 --> 5016.84
how to do but

5013.9 --> 5019.0
you have impulses that you can't really

5016.84 --> 5020.679
deal with like maybe monstrous impulses

5019.0 --> 5022.96
and then in your dreams you're like a

5020.679 --> 5024.58
monster and you just like to just

5022.96 --> 5026.7390000000005
sometimes just shoot everybody or

5024.58 --> 5028.78
something right well then an actual

5026.739 --> 5034.599999999999
psychosis

5028.78 --> 5037.659
is when suddenly you switch around

5034.6 --> 5040.42
you don't understand that it's not a

5037.659 --> 5042.339999999999
dream anymore and you just act like it

5040.42 --> 5044.62
as if it is a dream and you just like

5042.34 --> 5047.8
start being a monster

5044.62 --> 5050.0199999999995
if that is what happens if that's the

5047.8 --> 5053.02
Awakening within that dream state right

5050.02 --> 5055.42
that is the psychotic element when you

5053.02 --> 5058.179
can't distinguish anymore

5055.42 --> 5060.9400000000005
between reality and well what they say

5058.179 --> 5063.64
fantasy or the dream state

5060.94 --> 5065.86
that's really like that's serious

5063.64 --> 5067.06
psychosis and it's very potentially

5065.86 --> 5069.9
dangerous

5067.06 --> 5069.900000000001
with some people

5072.76 --> 5076.42
right

5074.739 --> 5078.94
and I think that's also what happens

5076.42 --> 5082.3
what goes so seriously wrong

5078.94 --> 5085.659
with ssris where people that suddenly go

5082.3 --> 5088.179
off it they that happens they literally

5085.659 --> 5090.099999999999
go in the berserking frenzy

5088.179 --> 5091.78
like they would in a dream where they're

5090.1 --> 5095.14
really pissed off and they just kill

5091.78 --> 5096.46
everybody including their own

5095.14 --> 5097.96
kids

5096.46 --> 5100.179
right which

5097.96 --> 5102.82
you could never do that in an awakened

5100.179 --> 5105.88
state so that is like a hardcore psych

5102.82 --> 5108.639999999999
psychosis flip

5105.88 --> 5112.0
when that happens hardcore psychosis

5108.64 --> 5115.320000000001
hardcore as hard as it gets

5112.0 --> 5115.32
usually end up dead

5116.44 --> 5121.239
so yeah SSRI is very dangerous

5119.56 --> 5123.9400000000005
actually

5121.239 --> 5125.919999999999
serious psychosis risk

5123.94 --> 5130.5599999999995
in my opinion

5125.92 --> 5130.56
I'm not a medical doctor I'm not a

5130.78 --> 5137.219
there's a chemist concerning Psychiatry

5133.6 --> 5137.219
but I know this from

5138.34 --> 5144.58
studying it out there

5141.72 --> 5148.659000000001
[Music]

5144.58 --> 5150.76
right but just having visions or dreams

5148.659 --> 5153.94
are really intense out of body

5150.76 --> 5155.679
experiences that is not psychosis but oh

5153.94 --> 5159.48
yeah if you're gonna go to the doctor

5155.679 --> 5164.62
and like oh I want the mainstream world

5159.48 --> 5166.599999999999
to accept this yes all right yeah that

5164.62 --> 5168.5199999999995
mainstream world

5166.6 --> 5169.780000000001
that doesn't even accept the Earth is

5168.52 --> 5173.76
flat

5169.78 --> 5176.62
that is engaged in eugenics

5173.76 --> 5179.5
genocidal programs oh yes they're no

5176.62 --> 5182.5599999999995
they're just going to accept it and no

5179.5 --> 5186.219
no you cannot

5182.56 --> 5189.52
do that you cannot convert the system to

5186.219 --> 5191.86
accepting your Visions or real yeah it

5189.52 --> 5195.76
will never be mainstream

5191.86 --> 5197.38
you're asking the Beast system to accept

5195.76 --> 5199.780000000001
reality

5197.38 --> 5201.9400000000005
it's not going to and if you keep doing

5199.78 --> 5204.099999999999
that it will [ __ ] you up it's gonna

5201.94 --> 5206.98
medicate you it's gonna ruin your life

5204.1 --> 5209.4400000000005
you're going to be marked as insane

5206.98 --> 5212.62
and your life is ruined now

5209.44 --> 5213.638999999999
and you probably become a drug addict

5212.62 --> 5216.88
yeah

5213.639 --> 5220.78
don't [ __ ] do that ever

5216.88 --> 5224.02
it's none of their [ __ ] business okay

5220.78 --> 5226.12
now if you're literally losing grip on

5224.02 --> 5228.52
what is reality between the dream and

5226.12 --> 5231.04
reality now that's a risk that's an

5228.52 --> 5233.26
actual problem you don't need medication

5231.04 --> 5235.54
for that you just need Focus you not

5233.26 --> 5238.0
just need to talk about it

5235.54 --> 5241.12
somebody that's actually supportive and

5238.0 --> 5243.28
not just trying to get that crazy notion

5241.12 --> 5246.28
out of your head like it's reality yeah

5243.28 --> 5249.12
no no that part those people need to go

5246.28 --> 5249.12
[ __ ] themselves

5249.219 --> 5252.82
why don't you go take your own

5250.54 --> 5254.86
psychology psychosis medicine and some

5252.82 --> 5257.739
of them even do by the way

5254.86 --> 5260.38
it's deranged

5257.739 --> 5264.58
you need to just talk about it you need

5260.38 --> 5267.06
to just talk about it to figure out what

5264.58 --> 5267.0599999999995
is real

5267.1 --> 5273.04
and then you can undo the psychotic

5269.8 --> 5274.2390000000005
effect then you can stop losing track of

5273.04 --> 5276.639
what is real

5274.239 --> 5279.638999999999
you just need to focus and to have

5276.639 --> 5281.62
somebody that will just accept it

5279.639 --> 5284.5
and help you

5281.62 --> 5288.46
be a reflection like be a reflection

5284.5 --> 5290.56
word for you to figure it out as your

5288.46 --> 5292.3
you need to talk about it to figure it

5290.56 --> 5296.38
out but not against somebody that's

5292.3 --> 5298.6
obstructive and there to just oh oh I

5296.38 --> 5302.26
want to just get you to the point where

5298.6 --> 5304.3
you're gonna deny it's real yes so

5302.26 --> 5307.360000000001
[ __ ] helpful no that's how you make

5304.3 --> 5310.5
the psychosis worse you piece of [ __ ]

5307.36 --> 5314.04
[ __ ] little psycho psychotic

5310.5 --> 5314.04
psychological Grappler

5317.32 --> 5321.96
ugh

5318.94 --> 5321.96
I hate those people

5322.06 --> 5325.679
they don't understand anything

5329.139 --> 5333.52
they're just denying that it exists

5331.3 --> 5335.8
that's their that's their resolve just

5333.52 --> 5336.530000000001
[ __ ] denying all of it

5335.8 --> 5339.609
idiots

5336.53 --> 5339.6089999999995
[Music]

5343.78 --> 5346.32
anyway

5353.08 --> 5358.26
do I know it's always a dark World

5355.239 --> 5358.259999999999
Experience no

5358.54 --> 5364.8
you have to figure that it figure out

5360.82 --> 5364.799999999999
that it is you don't just know

5365.5 --> 5371.679
I experience those types of things

5369.1 --> 5374.139
still at a very young age

5371.679 --> 5377.38
and my parents just thought it was just

5374.139 --> 5379.42
dreams or lucid dreams it's not just

5377.38 --> 5380.86
dreams or lucid dreams it's something

5379.42 --> 5383.86
else

5380.86 --> 5383.86
foreign

5386.46 --> 5390.82
lucid dream is just a higher sensory

5389.02 --> 5392.679
state but it's usually a very short

5390.82 --> 5395.199
moment no

5392.679 --> 5397.42
Dark World experience is a continual

5395.199 --> 5402.178999999999
lucid dream that you

5397.42 --> 5402.179
potentially can't snap out of

5406.9 --> 5411.159
or it's

5408.58 --> 5413.34
you can't just make it stop a lot of the

5411.159 --> 5413.339999999999
time

5413.5 --> 5419.38
you're like stuck in it

5416.62 --> 5422.8
you need to resolve something you need

5419.38 --> 5426.42
to figure out how to Let It Go

5422.8 --> 5426.42
what's doing that

5426.58 --> 5430.36
there's been entities there that would

5428.62 --> 5433.0199999999995
literally tell me like yeah you just

5430.36 --> 5433.0199999999995
have to die

5433.36 --> 5442.48
and I think that means just let go

5437.92 --> 5444.34
literally and then later in 2019 97 when

5442.48 --> 5447.5199999999995
I entered that dark world

5444.34 --> 5450.639
I forgot about that sort of

5447.52 --> 5453.52
or I was flustered confused about like

5450.639 --> 5455.32
rearranging my mind probably not in a

5453.52 --> 5458.620000000001
good way

5455.32 --> 5460.54
to embrace a new view on it which was

5458.62 --> 5463.42
illogical

5460.54 --> 5465.219
and I kind of forgot that and then I

5463.42 --> 5468.6990000000005
thought that they were literally talking

5465.219 --> 5471.82
about my real world

5468.699 --> 5474.04
like not the vision but my yeah my

5471.82 --> 5476.86
physical self death

5474.04 --> 5479.739
and then I kept going because I was

5476.86 --> 5483.46
afraid that I was afraid to actually die

5479.739 --> 5486.82
so in that sense within the vision

5483.46 --> 5489.1
that was psychotic because I thought it

5486.82 --> 5492.04
was actually I didn't understand it for

5489.1 --> 5493.84
what it really was I was off

5492.04 --> 5496.12
in a way

5493.84 --> 5497.4400000000005
throughout it

5496.12 --> 5499.659
and that

5497.44 --> 5502.0599999999995
kind of forced me to take it much more

5499.659 --> 5503.739
serious than I should have been taking

5502.06 --> 5506.080000000001
it

5503.739 --> 5507.5199999999995
and that resulted in just nightmares

5506.08 --> 5509.08
afterward

5507.52 --> 5512.139
like

5509.08 --> 5514.239
periods of like Savage demoralized

5512.139 --> 5518.6990000000005
sensation

5514.239 --> 5518.699
where it feels terrible about myself

5523.78 --> 5528.159
anyway

5526.12 --> 5530.82
did my siblings experience Dark World

5528.159 --> 5530.82
next week no

5531.1 --> 5535.679
or maybe but they don't talk about it

5536.139 --> 5538.8
like ever

5541.48 --> 5546.9
I think my mother has though has had

5544.06 --> 5546.900000000001
those experiences

5552.88 --> 5557.219
but she just thought it was dreams

5559.0 --> 5562.719
I'm not sure I'm not sure if she had

5561.1 --> 5565.900000000001
like a full Dark World Experience I'm

5562.719 --> 5568.96
not entirely sure maybe maybe she did I

5565.9 --> 5571.839999999999
I will never know because

5568.96 --> 5573.699
at the time I never really and at the

5571.84 --> 5576.159000000001
time I wasn't

5573.699 --> 5579.638999999999
I was just much more interested in my

5576.159 --> 5582.4
experience than really my parents

5579.639 --> 5585.52
so I didn't really hear them out about

5582.4 --> 5588.04
it didn't like inquire that deeply as I

5585.52 --> 5589.659000000001
would now now I inquire very deeply back

5588.04 --> 5593.699
when I was a little kid I didn't really

5589.659 --> 5593.699
do that that much and even as a teen

5593.98 --> 5599.5
I was just mostly spending a lot of time

5595.9 --> 5601.48
inquiring into myself so almost like a

5599.5 --> 5604.36
little self-obsessed and I guess that I

5601.48 --> 5607.299999999999
still have some of those traits

5604.36 --> 5610.54
but it's because I do stuff with it

5607.3 --> 5614.139
it's not just to distract me away from

5610.54 --> 5617.139
everything else I actually do construct

5614.139 --> 5622.38
with it I do constructive

5617.139 --> 5622.38
work on myself with doing that anyway

5623.26 --> 5626.56
wow

5624.699 --> 5630.239
man those

5626.56 --> 5630.2390000000005
20 minutes flew by quickly

5631.06 --> 5634.4800000000005
and that's what you get when people

5632.56 --> 5636.780000000001
subtly roll out good points and good

5634.48 --> 5636.78
questions

5637.0 --> 5639.6
uh

5648.58 --> 5651.42
we'll probably

5653.98 --> 5657.25
[Music]

5669.97 --> 5673.189
[Music]

5677.21 --> 5680.27
[Music]

5681.82 --> 5684.36
foreign

5692.34 --> 5695.9400000000005
make a good title

5696.52 --> 5701.139
difference between visions and psychosis

5699.159 --> 5703.299999999999
wouldn't you say

5701.139 --> 5705.1
I mean that was a very good point that I

5703.3 --> 5708.9400000000005
was making

5705.1 --> 5710.139
because it's so detailed and it's really

5708.94 --> 5712.78
an issue

5710.139 --> 5715.38
I mean Psychiatry is terrible

5712.78 --> 5715.38
at that

5715.48 --> 5719.138999999999
because

5717.06 --> 5722.139
I used to call that because of

5719.139 --> 5724.719
materialism because they just deny

5722.139 --> 5726.76
God and all that and a lot of the times

5724.719 --> 5729.46
that is the reason it's because they

5726.76 --> 5733.4400000000005
just don't get it they they don't accept

5729.46 --> 5733.44
it being a thing

5734.92 --> 5739.6
so they just call it delusion and then

5737.08 --> 5742.179
if you try to make a case why it's real

5739.6 --> 5744.280000000001
why it isn't just delusion

5742.179 --> 5746.1990000000005
that it might be a dream or something

5744.28 --> 5747.58
then they say oh that means you're

5746.199 --> 5750.419999999999
psychotic

5747.58 --> 5750.42
it isn't

5752.139 --> 5758.1990000000005
in a way dreams are real

5754.84 --> 5760.3
but they're not like the physical world

5758.199 --> 5763.98
real

5760.3 --> 5763.9800000000005
but they do have a purpose

5764.56 --> 5769.860000000001
it's there for a reason

5766.719 --> 5774.0
and sometimes those reasons actually

5769.86 --> 5774.0
transcend normal time

5774.28 --> 5779.5
it's like a some dreams can be a

5777.58 --> 5781.84
communication between your Timeless

5779.5 --> 5784.62
spirit and your Earthly vessel

5781.84 --> 5784.62
consciousness

5784.659 --> 5790.9
right the Contemporary Consciousness

5787.12 --> 5794.199
that the that I am now right now here

5790.9 --> 5796.42
you are right there where you are

5794.199 --> 5798.099999999999
but there is another self

5796.42 --> 5799.96
in the Timeless realm in the spirit

5798.1 --> 5803.139
realm that is the you that is the

5799.96 --> 5805.42
Timeless you and it is timeless and it

5803.139 --> 5807.58
can sometimes communicate things to you

5805.42 --> 5809.8
about the future

5807.58 --> 5812.26
even

5809.8 --> 5814.84
through your dreams

5812.26 --> 5819.159000000001
and that is real and that is something

5814.84 --> 5820.06
that Psychiatry absolutely cannot deal

5819.159 --> 5822.638999999999
with

5820.06 --> 5826.54
foundationally

5822.639 --> 5828.159000000001
that's why you should never go to them

5826.54 --> 5830.26
when you're having these types of

5828.159 --> 5832.78
experiences because they'll just try to

5830.26 --> 5834.04
take it away from you that's their

5832.78 --> 5836.32
solution

5834.04 --> 5838.92
suppress it don't don't go there don't

5836.32 --> 5838.92
think about it

5838.96 --> 5841.96
foreign

5848.38 --> 5851.88
that's right orange peel

5852.84 --> 5858.0
and they tried to do that with me too

5855.219 --> 5858.0
and

5858.04 --> 5863.739
I didn't keep pushing I didn't go why

5860.8 --> 5865.42
don't you understand me I realized just

5863.739 --> 5867.699
roughly around

5865.42 --> 5871.0
my teens

5867.699 --> 5873.9
that I think it was like around 15 or 16

5871.0 --> 5878.62
like they are just not going to learn

5873.9 --> 5880.719
I must become my own psychologist I have

5878.62 --> 5882.699
no other choice

5880.719 --> 5885.28
there's not going to be anybody out

5882.699 --> 5887.44
there that is going to respond to me in

5885.28 --> 5891.699
the way that I need

5887.44 --> 5894.159
I must become my own psychologist

5891.699 --> 5896.138999999999
I was already studying myself but then I

5894.159 --> 5898.659
realized no I actually have to also

5896.139 --> 5901.900000000001
besides just analyzing also take the

5898.659 --> 5905.62
responsibility for my own psychological

5901.9 --> 5908.92
well-being on a very high level

5905.62 --> 5911.58
and and like because there's nobody else

5908.92 --> 5911.58
that can do it

5912.159 --> 5916.0599999999995
because they just don't understand they

5914.5 --> 5917.92
just don't understand what the [ __ ]

5916.06 --> 5920.9800000000005
going on I understood it a lot better

5917.92 --> 5923.76
and it could make them understand by

5920.98 --> 5923.759999999999
explaining it

5924.219 --> 5928.0
but they would just then be kind of

5925.96 --> 5930.159
blown away and then didn't know what to

5928.0 --> 5933.36
do with it forget about it again and

5930.159 --> 5933.36
just go about their business

5935.62 --> 5941.08
right because what I needed mostly was

5938.199 --> 5943.62
somebody that I could try to explain

5941.08 --> 5946.9
these things to that I was experiencing

5943.62 --> 5949.0
I didn't need advice

5946.9 --> 5952.42
I need it

5949.0 --> 5955.6
a witness I needed a witness

5952.42 --> 5958.719
that could give sensory feedback to me

5955.6 --> 5961.5
as I was trying to explain it that is

5958.719 --> 5961.5
what I needed

5961.98 --> 5967.9
not advice

5964.9 --> 5970.719
because their advice sucked and was like

5967.9 --> 5974.46
on like three stairs cases lower than

5970.719 --> 5974.46
mine it's totally pointless

5978.94 --> 5982.96
doctors refused to look into spiritual

5981.46 --> 5985.42
metaphysical yeah but that's because

5982.96 --> 5988.139
they've been trained not to I mean it's

5985.42 --> 5988.139
not their field

5992.44 --> 5994.799999999999
foreign

6002.639 --> 6008.88
I mean some alternative doctors holistic

6005.94 --> 6010.86
doctors might actually right

6008.88 --> 6013.62
holistic doctors are a whole different

6010.86 --> 6016.259999999999
game when they're actually holistic and

6013.62 --> 6018.0
it's not just a like a corporate ruse

6016.26 --> 6020.6
promotion or whatever

6018.0 --> 6020.6
right

6021.239 --> 6026.879999999999
because the whole list holism within the

6024.42 --> 6028.9400000000005
medical field typically

6026.88 --> 6031.82
does

6028.94 --> 6034.919999999999
incorporate the spirit well-being

6031.82 --> 6037.799999999999
and just like a whole yeah holistic

6034.92 --> 6040.679
perspective which is very different from

6037.8 --> 6043.62
the allopathic perspective

6040.679 --> 6046.92
when the allopathic perspective is what

6043.62 --> 6049.739
actually drives Psychiatry that's the

6046.92 --> 6052.26
same root it's the same method of

6049.739 --> 6054.659
approach as allopathic medical system

6052.26 --> 6056.9400000000005
psychiatry

6054.659 --> 6059.4
a holistic doctors

6056.94 --> 6061.32
are different very different approach

6059.4 --> 6063.12
they don't typically do that and a lot

6061.32 --> 6065.5199999999995
of them are spiritually interested

6063.12 --> 6067.5599999999995
that's usually why they end up becoming

6065.52 --> 6069.659000000001
a holistic doctor

6067.56 --> 6071.580000000001
or in that field

6069.659 --> 6073.799999999999
because they are interested in spirit

6071.58 --> 6076.86
and do treasure it and don't want to

6073.8 --> 6079.820000000001
throw it away just to become part of the

6076.86 --> 6079.82
main system

6086.94 --> 6092.879999999999
like homeopath well I guess right

6090.78 --> 6095.239
I didn't know that about Homeopathy but

6092.88 --> 6095.2390000000005
sure

6097.08 --> 6103.44
thought the Homeopathy was pretty much a

6099.84 --> 6107.04
very physical based system

6103.44 --> 6107.04
but yeah

6112.199 --> 6116.5199999999995
anyway I hope you guys are enjoying the

6114.42 --> 6118.88
show it's been very interesting for me

6116.52 --> 6118.88
at least

6122.46 --> 6127.38
and this is a good subject to take into

6125.219 --> 6129.84
consideration because we're going to be

6127.38 --> 6132.36
dealing with a lot more of it

6129.84 --> 6133.619000000001
I mean with all that media [ __ ] rolling

6132.36 --> 6137.099999999999
out

6133.619 --> 6139.44
the hardcore 9084 double speak from the

6137.1 --> 6142.9800000000005
mainstream and all the fair porn and

6139.44 --> 6145.259999999999
like dark horror [ __ ] Unleashed on the

6142.98 --> 6148.799999999999
supposed Rebel side

6145.26 --> 6150.06
it's gonna cause a lot of people

6148.8 --> 6153.6
well

6150.06 --> 6155.6990000000005
that are gonna have visions that are

6153.6 --> 6157.139
because of the stress it's gonna unlock

6155.699 --> 6159.9
that

6157.139 --> 6162.06
the urgency and

6159.9 --> 6165.54
and psychosis on top of that because

6162.06 --> 6168.3
well double speak makes you psychotic it

6165.54 --> 6169.5
literally is like flipping it around too

6168.3 --> 6171.8
much

6169.5 --> 6171.8
foreign

6171.98 --> 6177.239
it just Blends into one and then that's

6175.02 --> 6179.1
psychosis right

6177.239 --> 6181.82
that's what double speak does so it's

6179.1 --> 6186.06
gonna breed both Visions

6181.82 --> 6190.38
trauma-based visions and psychosis so

6186.06 --> 6191.88
yeah very very relevant subject that I

6190.38 --> 6193.86
talked about today

6191.88 --> 6194.88
for the world right now to know about

6193.86 --> 6198.679
this

6194.88 --> 6198.679
very very relevant

6207.0 --> 6212.58
yeah orange built well look homeopathy

6213.3 --> 6219.179
is complicated it's not just that what

6217.08 --> 6221.46
you're talking about Orange Peel I mean

6219.179 --> 6223.92
that's like that's what I learned too

6221.46 --> 6225.119
but it's it's more complicated than just

6223.92 --> 6227.82
that

6225.119 --> 6230.82
I mean it's a pretty long

6227.82 --> 6233.88
elaborate field of study

6230.82 --> 6237.0599999999995
it's become that I I'm not super I'm not

6233.88 --> 6238.8
like a fan of Homeopathy but I do know

6237.06 --> 6240.3
that it's a little bit more complicated

6238.8 --> 6243.900000000001
than just

6240.3 --> 6246.08
just diluting something to microns and

6243.9 --> 6249.92
and that was supposed to do something

6246.08 --> 6249.92
it's not just that

6252.06 --> 6254.360000000001
right

6258.54 --> 6263.82
but

6259.76 --> 6266.04
I I mean if it was just a completely a

6263.82 --> 6268.28
failure then it would have died out by

6266.04 --> 6268.28
now

6270.719 --> 6274.44
so something's working

6272.76 --> 6277.9400000000005
you know

6274.44 --> 6277.94
otherwise it wouldn't be here

6279.5 --> 6287.109
[Music]

6287.219 --> 6292.88
anyway hope you guys enjoyed the show I

6290.04 --> 6292.88
think I'm gonna round out

6293.1 --> 6296.6
hey at freeze huh

6299.28 --> 6303.96
you can see the same thing about

6301.08 --> 6307.44
religion yeah but there is

6303.96 --> 6309.2390000000005
doesn't mean any of it is true well that

6307.44 --> 6311.759999999999
depends on what you're focusing on

6309.239 --> 6314.4
concerning the religion

6311.76 --> 6317.280000000001
is the experience not true

6314.4 --> 6319.799999999999
is what it does to you not true

6317.28 --> 6321.719
or are you just like oh no the things

6319.8 --> 6324.06
that they talk about didn't actually

6321.719 --> 6324.96
happen in the real world you can't prove

6324.06 --> 6326.219
it

6324.96 --> 6328.679
yeah so

6326.219 --> 6330.659
I know that part is the the exclusive

6328.679 --> 6334.8
part you're focused on because you're

6330.659 --> 6337.0199999999995
not a very spiritual person at phrase

6334.8 --> 6340.7390000000005
right but yeah religion is around

6337.02 --> 6343.619000000001
because it does serve a function

6340.739 --> 6345.54
there is things you can learn within

6343.619 --> 6349.82
religion

6345.54 --> 6349.82
that you cannot in other things

6350.34 --> 6355.32
it's just a fact

6352.619 --> 6357.78
right and then whether it is literally

6355.32 --> 6361.0199999999995
all historically true or something

6357.78 --> 6363.38
it becomes secondary

6361.02 --> 6363.38
anyway

6366.42 --> 6370.7390000000005
fun funny to see that you're still

6368.58 --> 6372.96
around by the way I haven't seen you

6370.739 --> 6376.199
around in a long time

6372.96 --> 6378.86
[Music]

6376.199 --> 6378.86
foreign

6380.6 --> 6387.06
okay evidence independent of experience

6384.48 --> 6389.94
that's cute

6387.06 --> 6394.52
so that completely excludes science then

6389.94 --> 6394.5199999999995
at Grace you do realize that right

6400.8 --> 6405.4800000000005
because

6402.42 --> 6407.639
if yeah if you're not experiencing it

6405.48 --> 6410.879999999999
then how can you

6407.639 --> 6414.32
very manipulated to see a result

6410.88 --> 6414.32
you'll have to do that

6416.58 --> 6420.139
yeah theoretical

6420.179 --> 6426.659
mental imagery and ideas and structures

6423.659 --> 6428.46
is not science just for the record

6426.659 --> 6430.32
science isn't based on experience no

6428.46 --> 6434.159
it's not based on measurements it's

6430.32 --> 6434.159
based on interacting

6434.219 --> 6440.88
with the phenomenon in order to prove

6438.78 --> 6444.179
the cause of an effect

6440.88 --> 6446.219
the interaction yeah that that is that

6444.179 --> 6448.9800000000005
has to be you have to experience it you

6446.219 --> 6450.42
have the experimenter has to be involved

6448.98 --> 6453.599999999999
with it

6450.42 --> 6456.42
so if you don't experience anything

6453.6 --> 6458.719
then how do you know it actually caused

6456.42 --> 6458.719
the effect

6459.9 --> 6464.46
so

6461.639 --> 6466.08
in my point stands at phrase I'm afraid

6464.46 --> 6468.56
you're not gonna get from underneath

6466.08 --> 6468.5599999999995
that one

6471.3 --> 6476.58
personal experience is irrelevant it's

6473.88 --> 6478.86
irrelevant yeah I know your personal

6476.58 --> 6481.92
experience is irrelevant

6478.86 --> 6483.96
because you've been ignoring it and then

6481.92 --> 6486.84
yeah it becomes irrelevant because you

6483.96 --> 6490.38
haven't actually connected up with

6486.84 --> 6494.4800000000005
supposed intellectual heritage

6490.38 --> 6494.4800000000005
that you're juggling with huh

6516.239 --> 6519.138999999999
right anyway

6519.42 --> 6523.92
next time if you want to talk join a

6521.76 --> 6527.360000000001
little earlier at face that's it it's

6523.92 --> 6527.36
kind of fun to see you back though

6528.9 --> 6535.82
I've had some hilarious times in the

6531.78 --> 6535.82
past on fvd with that phrase

6535.86 --> 6541.08
means that he has put his voice out so

6538.5 --> 6542.94
he's not just a Troll he's actually a

6541.08 --> 6545.719
person

6542.94 --> 6545.719
for the record

6548.1 --> 6551.96
although he can be very trollish

6558.239 --> 6560.419999999999
foreign

6561.679 --> 6565.76
experiments yeah but it does matter

6568.679 --> 6573.2390000000005
if you're

6570.84 --> 6576.0
like how can you know something is true

6573.239 --> 6577.638999999999
absolutely for real if you haven't done

6576.0 --> 6580.08
it yourself

6577.639 --> 6582.4400000000005
that means you're just trusting on other

6580.08 --> 6582.44
people

6584.46 --> 6590.76
or um just writing just because it is

6588.659 --> 6593.219
writing I mean

6590.76 --> 6595.9400000000005
actual science requires you to actually

6593.219 --> 6595.94
test it

6596.159 --> 6602.879999999999
