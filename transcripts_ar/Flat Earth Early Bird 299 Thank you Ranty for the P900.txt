70.06 --> 76.78
I don't know yeah you've seen the name

72.61 --> 78.82
of the episode anyway and of course the

76.78 --> 82.509
Super chats if that's the best way for

78.82 --> 84.07
you so good morning everyone today is I

82.509 --> 91.54
mean my t-shirt again because it's

84.07 --> 93.729
really lovely look at that oh just add a

91.54 --> 98.19000000000001
nice smoke on the roof there in the Sun

93.729 --> 104.83
a very mild warm wind it's great

98.19 --> 109.63
beautiful Sunday and I feel good no

104.83 --> 113.16
alcohol yesterday ray and I will people

109.63 --> 118.84
I'm doing this because it's such a clear

113.16 --> 120.429
calculation maybe you know dropping the

118.84 --> 122.92
ball a few more times

120.429 --> 126.13
still walking back but in my mind it is

122.92 --> 130.209
said I am going the direction of

126.13 --> 135.43
stopping drinking entirely for for the

130.209 --> 137.47
coming period for the winter yeah

135.43 --> 140.70000000000002
chocolate yeah

137.47 --> 144.31
stopping traffic I'm arrested I did a

140.7 --> 148.53
the Airwolf song in chat at the Flat

144.31 --> 157.39000000000001
Earth debates for me err that's true

148.53 --> 161.62
glad you recognized it anyway I got

157.39 --> 162.819
tumeric coffee with me and tea that's it

161.62 --> 167.159
good enough for now

162.819 --> 169.81
and well mm-hmm

167.159 --> 173.709
let's see who's in chat first before we

169.81 --> 177.329
move on okay hmm was first stone monkey

173.709 --> 184.739
3d a bit of a discussion about

177.329 --> 184.739
perspective Aaron Johnson Jensen's

189.799 --> 202.4
here Chico Amanda you Steve doc Michael

199.799 --> 207.87
Ratner Stefan he'll listen

202.4 --> 212.989
ya see delete delete and of course rest

207.87 --> 212.989
ahead yeah good to see you all

213.769 --> 225.269
so yeah was kind of surprised yes like

218.159 --> 229.68
really surprised actually because as we

225.269 --> 231.62900000000002
were doing the ball Buster's life and I

229.68 --> 233.43
was kind of distracted all because I was

231.629 --> 235.10899999999998
making such an awesome character I'm

233.43 --> 237.93
gonna be talking about that for a little

235.109 --> 240.389
but I was so distracted that I literally

237.93 --> 242.549
didn't understand the subject was

240.389 --> 245.609
addressed because I was just so into

242.549 --> 248.579
creating what I had imagined and I'll

245.609 --> 251.28
get to that later but anyway yeah then R

248.579 --> 254.549
Antigua went live said in the

251.28 --> 258.389
description like yeah giving OHP 900 so

254.549 --> 262.139
I thought oh okay right

258.389 --> 263.46000000000004
I had no idea that he was gonna turn out

262.139 --> 268.25
to give it to me

263.46 --> 268.25
because I read to be fair I've been so

268.849 --> 274.62
guarded towards ranty because of a lot

272.909 --> 279.71999999999997
of things that have happened in the past

274.62 --> 282.21
and just overweight that went on that I

279.72 --> 285.84000000000003
really expected him to just give it to

282.21 --> 289.5
somebody else just to nag me but I was

285.84 --> 293.71999999999997
completely wrong I really that was a

289.5 --> 296.699
Mitch misjudgment and in retrospect that

293.72 --> 299.94000000000005
was kind of dumb of me to expect that

296.699 --> 304.38
because ranty does like win-win

299.94 --> 307.53
situations he's not dumb and I never

304.38 --> 310.44
really thought he was but by the way you

307.53 --> 312.9
can be dumb and it gets so much done and

310.44 --> 315.83
so much figured out you can't be done so

312.9 --> 320.63899999999995
Randy is definitely not really dumb but

315.83 --> 327.75
yeah getting me that p900 it's

320.639 --> 333.539
that's really an awesome gift and and I

327.75 --> 337.02
hope I will how do you say be worthy of

333.539 --> 338.81899999999996
that gift because I do I'm not gonna

337.02 --> 341.639
just like ah finally I got it and then

338.819 --> 344.61
just let it collect dust somewhere no

341.639 --> 347.789
I'm definitely gonna start out with some

344.61 --> 350.939
actual nice Alessio photo photography

347.789 --> 353.06899999999996
and film maybe although it may take a

350.939 --> 355.5
while before I get it figured out I'm

353.069 --> 359.52000000000004
not really good with figuring out

355.5 --> 363.15
electronics but I will get it done I

359.52 --> 365.9
have to know I hope Randy still has the

363.15 --> 368.4
instruction manual or maybe he has

365.9 --> 372.75
extensive advice I'd definitely be

368.4 --> 375.419
welcome welcome for it although just try

372.75 --> 378.509
not to rush it because I get confused

375.419 --> 380.909
and stressed out really quickly in the

378.509 --> 384.349
beginning when learning new things when

380.909 --> 387.599
there's still so much to figure out so

384.349 --> 388.49
we'll get it worked out and yeah Thank

387.599 --> 393.509
You Randy

388.49 --> 395.729
thank you absolutely also a bit

393.509 --> 399.87
surprising though that you would give it

395.729 --> 401.789
away kind of like I guess I didn't see

399.87 --> 404.4
the whole hang out by the way that he

401.789 --> 406.11
did I haven't seen it I just jumped in

404.4 --> 409.08
at the moment and he pretty much said

406.11 --> 411.509
that he was gonna give it to me like

409.08 --> 417.599
jumped out of the ball busters panel for

411.509 --> 418.11
like five minutes so but yeah it's

417.599 --> 421.43899999999996
awesome

418.11 --> 427.589
and it certainly brighten up my mood a

421.439 --> 429.96000000000004
lot right PDF manual it'll work out

427.589 --> 434.039
I'm sure it will and there's so many

429.96 --> 435.719
people now that I know that have done

434.039 --> 437.339
things with it that will probably be

435.719 --> 438.509
willing to help if they can find the

437.339 --> 440.58
time for it

438.509 --> 443.72900000000004
I'll get it sorted out one way or the

440.58 --> 446.389
other so well yeah looking forward to

443.729 --> 446.389
that a lot

454.26 --> 461.15999999999997
and for in so many ways you know I

457.67 --> 463.29
wonder also can it be is it also an

461.16 --> 466.56
effective camera for like normal

463.29 --> 469.32
close-up shots because then I probably

466.56 --> 471.87
end up taking it with me everywhere just

469.32 --> 475.5
to see if I can catch interesting

471.87 --> 477.9
looking moments atmosphere pictures even

475.5 --> 481.11
if I were going out just like see if I'd

477.9 --> 485.7
let just get a good look I'm really good

481.11 --> 488.07
at getting very sharp foot photographs

485.7 --> 492.12
in relative action situations I got a

488.07 --> 494.69
feel for that I don't know if this

492.12 --> 497.34000000000003
camera is good for that probably have to

494.69 --> 501.03
heighten or shorten the shutter time and

497.34 --> 502.97999999999996
all that anyway we'll get there event it

501.03 --> 506.39
might take some time a little bit longer

502.98 --> 508.62
probably that the rest of the guys

506.39 --> 511.8
because I'm not great with new

508.62 --> 517.41
technology but once I get it figured out

511.8 --> 519.33
it'll be a natural part of me it's no I

517.41 --> 522.65
definitely not gonna see any curve with

519.33 --> 525.69
the camera I might see some concealment

522.65 --> 528.6899999999999
beyond the optical slant point we know

525.69 --> 532.9200000000001
as the horizon but now no curvature

528.69 --> 537.3800000000001
maybe a curvature of a hill there may be

532.92 --> 537.38
some hills here and there that's it

550.96 --> 553.96
yeah

556.82 --> 559.9300000000001
point it down

560.57 --> 563.1400000000001
what

570.06 --> 574.6999999999999
right so check oh well I might I

574.88 --> 579.0
definitely have if I'd have peed on

577.26 --> 580.89
hundred I said this before I'll

579.0 --> 585.35
definitely have more incentive to

580.89 --> 589.46
actually go to a beach for some reason

585.35 --> 589.46
because it can do something there

590.12 --> 594.9
unfortunately it really won't be the

592.47 --> 597.09
summer anymore on the other hand that

594.9 --> 600.65
can have its advantages if it's still

597.09 --> 604.0500000000001
relatively nice weather and clear and

600.65 --> 607.53
it's not so warm that's gonna be crowded

604.05 --> 611.3599999999999
on the beaches then I can get some

607.53 --> 611.36
really nice shots perhaps

617.959 --> 622.459
dock weekend arrest that

630.65 --> 639.15
no but I kind of do one a hashtag me if

636.33 --> 642.0
I had now if I'm gonna be out there with

639.15 --> 652.74
my camera I kind of want that hat to be

642.0 --> 655.2
a part of it I was thinking I don't know

652.74 --> 661.02
if it's the best of ideas but I kind of

655.2 --> 665.2800000000001
could convert my GoFundMe to getting was

661.02 --> 669.66
it 250 euros together for a batch of

665.28 --> 673.7099999999999
hashtag nifa hats because I I had to

669.66 --> 674.78
order them with a minimum of a hundred

673.71 --> 678.75
or something

674.78 --> 680.9399999999999
unfortunately so oh yeah I couldn't

678.75 --> 683.73
order just one thought it was kind of

680.94 --> 686.9100000000001
annoying as well but I don't know you

683.73 --> 690.36
you know what if I'd go have a hashtag

686.91 --> 694.0799999999999
me if I had um do that stuff and people

690.36 --> 696.3000000000001
want it I might just give them away to

694.08 --> 706.26
people that are interested in hashtag me

696.3 --> 708.66
for hats or who knows maybe I could the

706.26 --> 710.73
issue is I would probably just send them

708.66 --> 714.35
over the mail but then I'd have mailing

710.73 --> 714.35
bills and all that

714.59 --> 721.6800000000001
customs thing no but yeah I tried that

718.56 --> 726.2099999999999
that doesn't exist they don't do that

721.68 --> 728.1899999999999
here maybe I haven't really looked at

726.21 --> 733.47
the right spot but I did look around for

728.19 --> 737.85
a bit and I did ask around in town as

733.47 --> 740.64
well and nobody would really do it they

737.85 --> 743.76
do it for all kinds of things but either

740.64 --> 747.18
the the type of hats they will do it on

743.76 --> 750.33
would be extremely limited or you'd have

747.18 --> 757.0699999999999
to buy them in the big batch I don't

750.33 --> 762.99
know embroidery shop oh oh you mean like

757.07 --> 769.869
that like it's a custom-made Android hmm

762.99 --> 773.7090000000001
yeah I could try that it wouldn't look

769.869 --> 778.149
as flashy though because there is some

773.709 --> 781.2399999999999
kind of like a weird extra magic to it

778.149 --> 784.17
like I want it to look like it is a mass

781.24 --> 788.319
production item as well and kind of

784.17 --> 789.9699999999999
better quality i if it was embroidered

788.319 --> 792.2489999999999
then it looked like oh that is like a

789.97 --> 794.649
unique one-of-a-kind and it's our wins

792.249 --> 796.4200000000001
only and I don't want that I want other

794.649 --> 807.55
people to feel like hey that looks kind

796.42 --> 809.319
of cool can I have one as well so but I

807.55 --> 811.7199999999999
haven't considered that yet

809.319 --> 817.8
I might just step up to one of those

811.72 --> 822.0590000000001
shops and ask that that's interesting

817.8 --> 822.059
yeah thanks for the suggestion

826.91 --> 842.4599999999999
by hats right well I could try it I

839.21 --> 847.1700000000001
could try to get like the exact type of

842.46 --> 851.9100000000001
right neon yellow cap that I envisioned

847.17 --> 858.05
for it order that over the internet in a

851.91 --> 858.05
single one and then get that worked on

860.66 --> 868.6999999999999
sure but I haven't bumped into any of

866.19 --> 871.8000000000001
the exact type of hats that I wanted

868.7 --> 875.5200000000001
just looking around in the in town so

871.8 --> 877.8499999999999
far nobody seems to have those type of

875.52 --> 877.85
hats

885.43 --> 888.43
hmm

911.99 --> 918.3
well Rasta look I appreciate it advice

915.87 --> 920.7
let's talk about this stuff over Skype

918.3 --> 927.93
and not right during my hangout because

920.7 --> 942.33
it's it's it's a let's go ahead and get

927.93 --> 944.64
to that a little later anyway yeah yeah

942.33 --> 948.6800000000001
neon noodle I know a decent tripod I

944.64 --> 951.779
already mentioned that earlier because I

948.68 --> 957.89
see it is unlikely that rent is going to

951.779 --> 957.89
send the tripod with it as well so

965.35 --> 971.83
but yeah that might be better okay I

968.02 --> 973.5699999999999
think I'm gonna reroute the once I get

971.83 --> 975.9100000000001
to p900 I have to be sure that I'm

973.57 --> 979.0
actually going to be receiving it and

975.91 --> 992.61
once I get it I will change my GoFundMe

979.0 --> 992.61
into just for the tripod the ad

994.79 --> 997.7199999999999
whatever

1004.43 --> 1010.26
right well I'd like to have not a

1008.55 --> 1014.79
universal try but were the one that

1010.26 --> 1019.11
actually is of the of night what did the

1014.79 --> 1022.5889999999999
of Nikon themselves I want it to be one

1019.11 --> 1025.85
that was destined for the P 900 so

1022.589 --> 1025.8500000000001
there's not gonna be any issues

1036.1 --> 1039.6599999999999
did he say that now

1043.089 --> 1048.289
what he bought a condition on it I have

1046.37 --> 1051.9799999999998
no idea what you're talking about but

1048.289 --> 1054.89
yeah look the whole thing with the Bible

1051.98 --> 1057.44
yeah as soon as I get the actual

1054.89 --> 1062.9
opportunity that I can actually spare it

1057.44 --> 1065.059
I will ya buy it but it's in my

1062.9 --> 1072.1000000000001
financial situation it's it's now a

1065.059 --> 1074.45
luxury I I said that before so yeah I

1072.1 --> 1077.6299999999999
didn't think that Bible that Trish

1074.45 --> 1079.4
specified was a bad idea I just can't

1077.63 --> 1081.7990000000002
afford it right now and even though she

1079.4 --> 1086.299
donated quite a substantial amount to my

1081.799 --> 1090.6689999999999
super chat already shared that that

1086.299 --> 1093.6689999999999
doesn't actually all end up in my pocket

1090.669 --> 1093.669
so

1107.95 --> 1127.3300000000002
right well if that is it that's what

1113.36 --> 1127.33
this is all about fine what okay

1136.77 --> 1143.3899999999999
all right sure sure I'll get right on it

1143.96 --> 1154.26
fine all right I'll just get a whatever

1152.34 --> 1156.87
Bible if that is what this is all about

1154.26 --> 1159.99
if this is some kind of ridiculous

1156.87 --> 1162.12
vampire test like I am just trying to

1159.99 --> 1164.91
get around it because I can't really own

1162.12 --> 1167.04
a Bible because I spontaneously ignite

1164.91 --> 1170.16
if I touch one you know that kind of

1167.04 --> 1172.92
maybe they are really that [ __ ] that

1170.16 --> 1176.3700000000001
they're just neurotically trying to push

1172.92 --> 1180.89
this through I don't know what it is but

1176.37 --> 1180.8899999999999
fine I don't really give a [ __ ] you know

1181.04 --> 1194.97
I'll get a Bible somewhere yeah I heard

1189.84 --> 1198.54
yeah I heard you mercury m7 it's been

1194.97 --> 1200.88
set like ten times before in this chat

1198.54 --> 1203.49
and I'm reading it as I'm talking so

1200.88 --> 1206.429
just so you know I know I know

1203.49 --> 1208.47
Bibles are free I know Bibles are free

1206.429 --> 1212.67
Bibles are free I know

1208.47 --> 1215.179
Bibles are free I know okay is that

1212.67 --> 1215.179
clear

1215.63 --> 1218.769
[Music]

1226.94 --> 1230.089
[Music]

1245.94 --> 1262.1100000000001
I'd say about 200 meters [ __ ] no sir

1259.17 --> 1265.8300000000002
check oh I I think I even have it

1262.11 --> 1269.1299999999999
downloaded somewhere but no I have to

1265.83 --> 1272.99
have the paper and I don't know what

1269.13 --> 1276.93
they got in in stock for me maybe they I

1272.99 --> 1278.94
think they're I seriously am now if this

1276.93 --> 1281.94
is real I don't know if it is I haven't

1278.94 --> 1284.16
heard from Bronte maybe everybody's just

1281.94 --> 1287.21
playing on me right now so I'm just

1284.16 --> 1290.16
gonna leave it I'll see what's going on

1287.21 --> 1298.44
I'll ask around if it is indeed

1290.16 --> 1302.3700000000001
conditional that would be pretty pretty

1298.44 --> 1306.99
annoying if that is the case and I don't

1302.37 --> 1310.6699999999998
think so but anyway look I don't know

1306.99 --> 1314.76
what other people other flat-earthers

1310.67 --> 1316.53
the my fellow debaters whatever I don't

1314.76 --> 1320.7
know what they're thinking about me and

1316.53 --> 1323.16
my Christian attitude and being super

1320.7 --> 1325.8
inconveniently honest and straight and

1323.16 --> 1326.64
all that right don't know what they

1325.8 --> 1330.12
think about it

1326.64 --> 1334.3400000000001
but I'm not gonna change or create or

1330.12 --> 1336.2399999999998
set up a show that's gonna be all about

1334.34 --> 1338.9099999999999
Christianity and the Bible constantly

1336.24 --> 1343.14
that's never gonna happen it's not my

1338.91 --> 1345.5400000000002
thing so I don't know what anybody's

1343.14 --> 1348.39
expecting but even if I got a Bible if

1345.54 --> 1351.42
you think that I'm on my show gonna

1348.39 --> 1354.5900000000001
bring out some verse every day you can

1351.42 --> 1359.73
forget about it it's not gonna happen

1354.59 --> 1365.22
I'm a some point they show do a lot

1359.73 --> 1367.47
about it just this in the past you don't

1365.22 --> 1373.25
need a Bible for that you just need to

1367.47 --> 1373.25
be interested in the moment doing that

1382.26 --> 1385.1299999999999
okay

1390.09 --> 1392.6589999999999
what

1392.9 --> 1407.41
right could be yes your esta

1397.33 --> 1407.4099999999999
now I'll hear him up you know we'll see

1415.33 --> 1421.1299999999999
look but even if it if it turns out to

1418.34 --> 1423.59
be that annoying and like its condition

1421.13 --> 1426.98
you have to get a Bible and especially

1423.59 --> 1430.4599999999998
if Trish is then gonna be behind it and

1426.98 --> 1433.64
start claiming like some queen like she

1430.46 --> 1435.919
made me into a true Christian thank

1433.64 --> 1439.91
thanks to the help of grantees

1435.919 --> 1443.7800000000002
generosity because she made me get that

1439.91 --> 1446.659
Bible that's yeah that's really

1443.78 --> 1450.289
disgusting but I'd actually just take it

1446.659 --> 1451.88
anyway because I'll just ignore her if

1450.289 --> 1462.2
that is really what she's going to be

1451.88 --> 1465.89
doing right they can they can think that

1462.2 --> 1469.3400000000001
all they like I was a Christian by my

1465.89 --> 1471.47
own consent and trust me before that

1469.34 --> 1476.9289999999999
time oh yeah there's been plenty of

1471.47 --> 1479.3600000000001
Christians trying trying to get me on

1476.929 --> 1482.6000000000001
the right path as they envisioned it

1479.36 --> 1486.82
while I was doing my own thing that

1482.6 --> 1486.82
doesn't work it never works

1499.35 --> 1502.4299999999998
[Music]

1504.059 --> 1511.59
well Fyodor Dostoevsky look I'd agree

1509.159 --> 1517.7
that it is a useful tool and having a

1511.59 --> 1517.6999999999998
Bible has advantages absolutely I just

1519.109 --> 1526.4689999999998
I've been trying to demonstrate that

1522.479 --> 1529.1090000000002
it's not essential it is essential to

1526.469 --> 1532.739
have the recognition but possession yeah

1529.109 --> 1535.619
that's convenient but I don't personally

1532.739 --> 1537.839
think it is essential look if there were

1535.619 --> 1539.6999999999998
no Bibles in the world and nobody would

1537.839 --> 1544.649
know what was written in them yeah that

1539.7 --> 1547.789
would be a big problem but if you just

1544.649 --> 1550.4989999999998
know what it's about if you understand

1547.789 --> 1552.479
the overarching principles and the

1550.499 --> 1555.089
complex depth and the personal

1552.479 --> 1558.589
entanglement that everyone has once they

1555.089 --> 1563.489
engage if you just get that that is

1558.589 --> 1566.07
enough and that you remember that is the

1563.489 --> 1570.1390000000001
critical part about it not that you

1566.07 --> 1573.239
continually just read pages every day

1570.139 --> 1578.1899999999998
although that may work very well for

1573.239 --> 1584.94
some people it might go that right down

1578.19 --> 1587.8490000000002
their Lane of how they can function but

1584.94 --> 1594.779
it's everyone's own choice it it's about

1587.849 --> 1597.119
understanding the spirit of it that's

1594.779 --> 1600.089
what makes it that's what real

1597.119 --> 1605.039
Christians are not that you have items

1600.089 --> 1607.379
that that is what the Catholics did with

1605.039 --> 1611.609
their form of Christianity make it about

1607.379 --> 1619.789
items and individuals items and saints

1611.609 --> 1622.9189999999999
and little tricks and blessings and an

1619.789 --> 1626.549
atonement with bribes and all that

1622.919 --> 1631.969
it's materialization of Christianity and

1626.549 --> 1631.969
I firmly oppose that

1633.05 --> 1641.81
I think a person with absolutely no

1638.03 --> 1645.79
possessions whatsoever but with the

1641.81 --> 1650.6299999999999
clear spirit and mind can be a Christian

1645.79 --> 1654.71
if they have been confronted with the

1650.63 --> 1658.24
Bible and got to the point where they

1654.71 --> 1658.24
started to really understand it

1678.509 --> 1689.1
Preston Parker well things this place

1683.759 --> 1690.779
all over the place on earth that's yeah

1689.1 --> 1695.1899999999998
it's caused by a relative density

1690.779 --> 1698.789
disequilibrium when the density of an

1695.19 --> 1701.159
object is very different from the

1698.789 --> 1703.23
density of the medium it is in and then

1701.159 --> 1706.0800000000002
providing there's maneuverability it

1703.23 --> 1708.45
will start to accelerate from its

1706.08 --> 1714.09
disequilibrium point towards its

1708.45 --> 1718.3500000000001
equilibrium point until it can no longer

1714.09 --> 1721.1
maneuver that is how that works on a

1718.35 --> 1725.1789999999999
flat earth or earth or in this realm

1721.1 --> 1725.1789999999999
here in the real world

1739.98 --> 1745.32
all right so yeah just one more thing

1743.88 --> 1749.279
about the whole Bible and then just

1745.32 --> 1752.9399999999998
please move on right as I said you don't

1749.279 --> 1755.039
need it to be a Christian but that

1752.94 --> 1757.769
doesn't mean that you shouldn't have one

1755.039 --> 1759.87
either it's not like oh if you're going

1757.769 --> 1762.6
with all these items then that

1759.87 --> 1765.4399999999998
automatically makes you bad Christian or

1762.6 --> 1768.1789999999999
something no that's not true either

1765.44 --> 1770.97
it all depends on what your focus is

1768.179 --> 1774.929
gonna be are you gonna be a focus in on

1770.97 --> 1777.929
unraveling like item collecting or

1774.929 --> 1780.96
hoarding which that can turn out to

1777.929 --> 1782.8500000000001
become if you're engaged in that if that

1780.96 --> 1785.51
is your focus then you're sidestepping

1782.85 --> 1788.1589999999999
the actual point of the Christianity and

1785.51 --> 1791.519
evading the path by being distracted by

1788.159 --> 1796.3200000000002
grappler behavior collection drifts

1791.519 --> 1800.09
hoarding and then you're a bad Christian

1796.32 --> 1803.789
but if you do have a lot of items and

1800.09 --> 1808.519
still manage to actually focus on the

1803.789 --> 1808.519
spiritual path as well then it works

1815.12 --> 1823.3999999999999
but when the path concerns and walking

1818.45 --> 1826.01
it yeah it there is like a fist rule for

1823.4 --> 1831.7
it and that is it refers back to that

1826.01 --> 1834.29
for a wealthy person to go to heaven is

1831.7 --> 1837.07
more likely than for it what is it a

1834.29 --> 1841.61
camel to go through the eye of a needle

1837.07 --> 1844.73
because the more material things you

1841.61 --> 1848.03
have or options doing things with the

1844.73 --> 1850.3700000000001
material realm trade money items that

1848.03 --> 1851.78
can do things towards other in the

1850.37 --> 1854.3799999999999
material realm the more you have of

1851.78 --> 1857.81
those the more you get distracted

1854.38 --> 1861.3200000000002
dragged down from the actual spiritual

1857.81 --> 1869.6599999999999
path the less possessions you have the

1861.32 --> 1871.82
better it works and in all times this is

1869.66 --> 1874.76
also the reasons why monks basically

1871.82 --> 1878.54
lived a life of humility and poverty

1874.76 --> 1881.33
because that helps so much better to

1878.54 --> 1883.43
focus on actually getting the frequency

1881.33 --> 1886.1299999999999
right that's the reason behind it

1883.43 --> 1890.3300000000002
because material possessions are a

1886.13 --> 1892.9
distraction to walking the path even if

1890.33 --> 1898.54
those material possessions are claimed

1892.9 --> 1902.45
to help you walk the path if you then

1898.54 --> 1905.21
get distracted by the material nature of

1902.45 --> 1908.06
the items and start collecting start

1905.21 --> 1910.3700000000001
hoarding then you've evaded the path and

1908.06 --> 1912.5
you've actually defeated the purpose of

1910.37 --> 1919.51
what the items were supposedly for in

1912.5 --> 1919.51
the first place so I hope that helps

1928.28 --> 1936.06
[Music]

1931.11 --> 1936.06
no I am NOT

1944.34 --> 1947.2099999999998
hello Jose

1956.57 --> 1968.06
yeah literally right well look as I

1965.03 --> 1970.31
presented it just now the littleit I'm

1968.06 --> 1973.07
not saying that you literally have to be

1970.31 --> 1976.07
naked and have absolutely is nothing but

1973.07 --> 1978.47
what is part of your body in order to be

1976.07 --> 1980.6
a proper Christian no no no no I'm just

1978.47 --> 1985.6100000000001
saying that the more you have the more

1980.6 --> 1990.9499999999998
material you've gathered that you own

1985.61 --> 1993.35
legally or consider to own the more you

1990.95 --> 1996.74
will get distracted so if you just have

1993.35 --> 1998.06
a pair of clothes and maybe a bag with

1996.74 --> 1999.6200000000001
more clothes that's not going to be a

1998.06 --> 2002.8899999999999
lot of distraction although it could be

1999.62 --> 2005.53
at times you know things that you don't

2002.89 --> 2009.3700000000001
have can also distract you a lot if

2005.53 --> 2010.6499999999999
you're kind of needed but yeah that's

2009.37 --> 2013.87
complicated

2010.65 --> 2018.27
it's just that if you have a lot it

2013.87 --> 2018.27
tends to distract you a lot more

2032.32 --> 2038.37
Preston Parker has some serious trouble

2034.75 --> 2043.179
understanding the relative density issue

2038.37 --> 2046.4089999999999
yeah things do not fall up because the

2043.179 --> 2050.44
density of the medium above it is

2046.409 --> 2054.79
definitely going to be lower than it and

2050.44 --> 2058.78
it only goes towards the point where the

2054.79 --> 2063.429
medium could potentially be of equal

2058.78 --> 2064.69
density as it and well with a rock for

2063.429 --> 2066.639
example in air that's never going to

2064.69 --> 2070.179
happen because there's no point in the

2066.639 --> 2072.849
air at any point where it is going to be

2070.179 --> 2075.339
even close to having the same density as

2072.849 --> 2078.01
a rock so then it will just lay on the

2075.339 --> 2080.74
ground and because it's still surrounded

2078.01 --> 2083.139
by dense by.ya era that is less dense

2080.74 --> 2087.359
than it it will then because it can no

2083.139 --> 2092.139
longer maneuver push with pressure as

2087.359 --> 2094.359
long it is not surrounded dipped in some

2092.139 --> 2096.25
kind of liquid very likely that is of

2094.359 --> 2098.77
equal density of the rock itself in

2096.25 --> 2100.98
which it would freely be suspended if it

2098.77 --> 2100.98
were

2108.37 --> 2112.21
[Music]

2109.8 --> 2116.4100000000003
the relative density theory is

2112.21 --> 2119.68
everything about the medium versus the

2116.41 --> 2121.96
object that is in that medium what will

2119.68 --> 2125.6499999999996
it do and being able to predict that

2121.96 --> 2129.07
based on the densities of it versus the

2125.65 --> 2129.55
medium it is in and it works out every

2129.07 --> 2132.4
time

2129.55 --> 2134.77
it's definitely fall it definitely falls

2132.4 --> 2140.8
into the category of the scientific

2134.77 --> 2141.08
method just ask a sleeping warrior about

2140.8 --> 2144.32

2160.34 --> 2164.1400000000003
the gravity waves

2167.769 --> 2174.9199999999996
like grab gravity waves and what would

2172.67 --> 2180.38
be causing these gravity waves according

2174.92 --> 2182.509
to what theory because is that the

2180.38 --> 2186.2000000000003
bending of space-time that causes the

2182.509 --> 2192.049
gravity waves where was that ever stated

2186.2 --> 2197.0789999999997
I think that gravity waves is a complete

2192.049 --> 2201.44
fictional concept totally fictional and

2197.079 --> 2203.599
look there may be some weird force alike

2201.44 --> 2205.43
distortions going on because of the

2203.599 --> 2210.069
electromagnetic changing nature of the

2205.43 --> 2213.95
world there may be fluctuations in

2210.069 --> 2216.829
what's going on but to presume that is

2213.95 --> 2220.3999999999996
that it is gravity waves when it's not

2216.829 --> 2222.8590000000004
even clear what gravity really is that

2220.4 --> 2228.339
that just doesn't make sense it's

2222.859 --> 2234.069
literally conjuring up conceptual things

2228.339 --> 2237.969
out of nothing not based on any theory

2234.069 --> 2237.969
it's conjuration

2240.4 --> 2249.7200000000003
a string theory

2254.64 --> 2263.91
all right well you do realize that

2257.849 --> 2269.099
string theory is technically how do you

2263.91 --> 2271.319
say it is literally looking for a needle

2269.099 --> 2273.299
in a haystack that is the foundations of

2271.319 --> 2276.17
what that is every time that's why

2273.299 --> 2280.859
nobody can get anything viable out of it

2276.17 --> 2283.759
it's so theoretical so big nobody's

2280.859 --> 2286.89
getting anything out of it

2283.759 --> 2289.71
it's just another way to conceptualize

2286.89 --> 2293.22
as to how the foundations of this micro

2289.71 --> 2296.64
world works makes no sense it's very

2293.22 --> 2299.029
little actual proof surrounding a string

2296.64 --> 2299.029
theory

2311.78 --> 2320.23
and besides string theory conflicts with

2315.37 --> 2320.23
everything else also

2333.5 --> 2341.599
all right

2335.41 --> 2348.17
Oh Resta sorry I don't know what I'm

2341.599 --> 2349.73
supposed to say [ __ ] to the LIGO is

2348.17 --> 2354.38
this I don't even know what the supposed

2349.73 --> 2357.589
LIGO experiment waits I've a glee

2354.38 --> 2359.599
remembers someone mentioning that's just

2357.589 --> 2370.849
some time ago I don't even remember what

2359.599 --> 2379.78
that was now Preston Parker I don't

2370.849 --> 2383.1800000000003
really care to to debate you on any yeah

2379.78 --> 2386.329
presuppositional micro world theory that

2383.18 --> 2392.54
has very little actual proof it's just

2386.329 --> 2394.94
like pattern recognition within its on

2392.54 --> 2398.119
the same kind of level nonsense as what

2394.94 --> 2400.849
happens in the there's a little

2398.119 --> 2405.559
difference to forget the whole thing in

2400.849 --> 2410.4500000000003
France the cyclotron the thing why do I

2405.559 --> 2413.3590000000004
forget it yeah interpreting a bunch of

2410.45 --> 2416.569
lines on the black background that's

2413.359 --> 2419.75
kind of what string theory falls in is

2416.569 --> 2425.119
just finding the patterns in in total

2419.75 --> 2427.25
chaos with very little success rate of

2425.119 --> 2429.44
people actually smart enough to even

2427.25 --> 2431.29
attempt to figure it out what the

2429.44 --> 2434.78
patterns could be it and there's no real

2431.29 --> 2440.41
sensibility coming from it anyway I've

2434.78 --> 2443.9300000000003
never heard any kind of physical

2440.41 --> 2446.8289999999997
adaptation or experimental adaptation as

2443.93 --> 2450.73
to how string theory has been applied

2446.829 --> 2450.73
technological wise in any way

2462.63 --> 2465.319
Wow

2466.78 --> 2475.02
gravity waves due to rotation around the

2470.32 --> 2475.02
Sun Jesus

2477.64 --> 2490.1189999999997
that's still monkey 3 that's just

2482.16 --> 2492.22
ridiculous there is no gravity waves

2490.119 --> 2494.799
there's no alteration of how heavy

2492.22 --> 2495.91
things perceivably are air there's no

2494.799 --> 2498.099
thing

2495.91 --> 2500.41
swinging into a certain direction it's

2498.099 --> 2502.839
just total nonsense

2500.41 --> 2505.359
it's all what should be what should be

2502.839 --> 2508.8089999999997
what is not again just like with the

2505.359 --> 2512.2889999999998
Coriolis nonsense yeah indeed things

2508.809 --> 2514.42
high up should be spinning or not

2512.289 --> 2517.599
spinning as the Earth spins underneath

2514.42 --> 2519.9990000000003
but it doesn't same goes for this yeah

2517.599 --> 2522.19
all these things gravity waves should

2519.999 --> 2524.7389999999996
definitely have these certain intervals

2522.19 --> 2531.2200000000003
in this periodic window yet closure blah

2524.739 --> 2533.88
it doesn't it's just more imagining of

2531.22 --> 2535.569
how it should be in heliocentric

2533.88 --> 2538.529
conceptualization well that's not

2535.569 --> 2538.529
reality sorry

2575.18 --> 2582.91
that sounds like a ridiculous conspiracy

2577.64 --> 2582.91
theory fyodor dostoyevsky but whatever

2612.77 --> 2615.77
okay

2628.84 --> 2638.25
look mercury m7 just save it for the

2633.07 --> 2641.23
debates okay is as Nathan not been

2638.25 --> 2643.87
explaining it for hours and hours and

2641.23 --> 2646.7400000000002
hours basically screaming at this point

2643.87 --> 2646.74
is that not enough

2655.01 --> 2663.67
the weather patterns it's ridiculous the

2659.99 --> 2663.6699999999996
weather patterns go in all directions

2663.79 --> 2670.609
that's not consistent with the spinning

2666.859 --> 2674.0
of a ball it should only go in one

2670.609 --> 2678.3199999999997
direction or maybe if counter wise

2674.0 --> 2681.17
through turbulence go slightly less fast

2678.32 --> 2684.4700000000003
in that direction should not be just

2681.17 --> 2686.78
literally going in both ways on a

2684.47 --> 2689.0
singular rate that's not consistent with

2686.78 --> 2695.5400000000004
any kind of pattern that should come

2689.0 --> 2701.48
forth from earth spinning underneath air

2695.54 --> 2703.369
layers because if hey if that spinning

2701.48 --> 2704.869
underneath the air in any kind of way

2703.369 --> 2706.73
even though it's supposedly in lockstep

2704.869 --> 2708.82
with the earth though that negates it

2706.73 --> 2711.68
entirely but even if it were doing that

2708.82 --> 2714.4700000000003
yeah oh sure there may be spinning

2711.68 --> 2718.25
patterns coming out of it but that would

2714.47 --> 2721.49
be caused by the air moving over the

2718.25 --> 2724.1
earth in the first place so that would

2721.49 --> 2728.54
not result in the supposed tornadoes

2724.1 --> 2732.83
caused by the air turning over the earth

2728.54 --> 2734.96
as it were they shouldn't be going in

2732.83 --> 2738.2799999999997
relation to the orientation of the earth

2734.96 --> 2741.26
itself in both directions at equal rates

2738.28 --> 2744.25
that should never happen that doesn't

2741.26 --> 2744.25
make any sense

2745.51 --> 2751.46
understand so if the air were moving

2749.3 --> 2754.55
over the earth because the earth was

2751.46 --> 2757.82
spinning underneath right and that

2754.55 --> 2760.1000000000004
spinning or that moving of the air would

2757.82 --> 2763.04
cause tornadoes and all that the

2760.1 --> 2765.68
spinning of the air the turbulence then

2763.04 --> 2769.0099999999998
yeah that would be part of the air still

2765.68 --> 2770.6
moving over the earth all going in that

2769.01 --> 2773.6000000000004
one direction relatively and then

2770.6 --> 2777.41
spinning across that as it is moving in

2773.6 --> 2780.0499999999997
that one direction so hey if then by

2777.41 --> 2782.81
turbulence the natural evolving of

2780.05 --> 2784.6400000000003
turbulence they yeah some parts of it

2782.81 --> 2787.77
would be sort of spinning in opposite

2784.64 --> 2790.3199999999997
directions that means that one

2787.77 --> 2792.48
of the spins in one direction is going

2790.32 --> 2794.4300000000003
to go very fast over the earth in

2792.48 --> 2796.85
relation to the one going in the other

2794.43 --> 2799.74
direction which is going to go very

2796.85 --> 2801.66
slowly the other direction or not even

2799.74 --> 2805.22
the other direction just much slower

2801.66 --> 2811.74
across the earth in the same direction

2805.22 --> 2814.83
if you presume that all that turbulence

2811.74 --> 2822.6
and the weather patterns is actually

2814.83 --> 2824.04
caused as a Coriolis by the air staying

2822.6 --> 2827.25
in the same place and the earth spinning

2824.04 --> 2829.11
underneath okay that's the only way you

2827.25 --> 2830.7
could figure that out and then there

2829.11 --> 2833.1
would be certain consequences as I

2830.7 --> 2835.35
explained because if the weather

2833.1 --> 2837.81
patterns come because the earth is

2835.35 --> 2840.27
spinning underneath the air then all

2837.81 --> 2842.91
that air is still going to be moving in

2840.27 --> 2845.16
that singular direction whatever

2842.91 --> 2848.33
turbulence effect comes out of it

2845.16 --> 2848.33
just saying

2862.369 --> 2868.259
all right

2864.559 --> 2871.46
eastward headwinds are caused by

2868.259 --> 2878.16
Coriolis oh how about the west winds

2871.46 --> 2880.789
mercury m7 how about those you know the

2878.16 --> 2883.71
one I just included in my full

2880.789 --> 2889.19
explanation how about those who's that

2883.71 --> 2889.19
mercury m7 can you address that perhaps

2891.74 --> 2895.519
this is where you go away

2905.0 --> 2912.29
Oh Preston Parker oh oh you got me

2908.99 --> 2914.66
seasons the seasons story on the

2912.29 --> 2918.68
heliocentric made model makes absolutely

2914.66 --> 2920.69
no sense where the distance towards the

2918.68 --> 2922.6699999999996
Sun of the earth is supposedly going to

2920.69 --> 2927.91
have some kind of influence and it's

2922.67 --> 2931.099
very close during the summer and winter

2927.91 --> 2933.02
that's gonna result on one side having

2931.099 --> 2935.57
all winter and on the other side having

2933.02 --> 2937.7599999999998
summer that makes no damn sense just

2935.57 --> 2940.4
starting out with that right

2937.76 --> 2944.84
as for what causes the seasons on the

2940.4 --> 2947.7200000000003
Flat Earth well the Sun cycles perhaps

2944.84 --> 2949.04
they seem to be specifically attuned in

2947.72 --> 2952.06
relation to position on the earth

2949.04 --> 2957.5
dividing by the apparent equator line

2952.06 --> 2960.0499999999997
into two opposing cycles of the Sun and

2957.5 --> 2963.92
when the Sun is at its dimmest and the

2960.05 --> 2968.4500000000003
moon is at its strongest that is when

2963.92 --> 2970.42
things get colder and when the Sun gets

2968.45 --> 2973.6699999999996
strongest and the moon gets dimmest

2970.42 --> 2977.51
that's when it gets really hot those

2973.67 --> 2982.31
that is how the seasons work on a flat

2977.51 --> 2985.76
earth so if you could please explain how

2982.31 --> 2992.45
there can be summer and winter on the

2985.76 --> 2994.4
same globe at a short distance from the

2992.45 --> 2997.4199999999996
Sun that that would be nice if you could

2994.4 --> 2997.42
explain that somehow

3002.35 --> 3011.66
because usually a few your proximity to

3007.4 --> 3014.39
a vast giant heat and light source that

3011.66 --> 3017.87
proximity becomes less you get closer

3014.39 --> 3021.2599999999998
then overall the heat increases that's

3017.87 --> 3026.39
fist rule if you assume all that so how

3021.26 --> 3028.8500000000004
can then it be colder on one side of the

3026.39 --> 3032.44
earth which is still connected through

3028.85 --> 3039.14
atmosphere well when it's further away

3032.44 --> 3043.0
it's not as cold and not as hot but also

3039.14 --> 3047.5099999999998
not as cold during the spring and the

3043.0 --> 3050.23
autumn part of the cycle around the Sun

3047.51 --> 3053.2900000000004
it makes no sense none of that makes any

3050.23 --> 3053.29
logical sense

3057.07 --> 3064.79
now it wasn't Preston Parker I just

3060.95 --> 3069.02
explained to you the way the Sun cycles

3064.79 --> 3072.59
work is very specific to the relation of

3069.02 --> 3075.05
the position of the earth it's divided

3072.59 --> 3079.34
how these Sun functions what type of

3075.05 --> 3082.73
output the apparent Sun disk has is very

3079.34 --> 3091.27
specific to the location within the

3082.73 --> 3091.27
earth realm it's not a singular source

3092.5 --> 3098.37
okay

3095.22 --> 3098.37
[Music]

3099.71 --> 3107.76
whatever the source of the daylight is

3102.96 --> 3114.089
outputting depends on the time and the

3107.76 --> 3117.9500000000003
location on the earth not just just

3114.089 --> 3117.95
drinking green tea so checker right

3128.99 --> 3135.5099999999998
Resta ridiculous isn't that it's very

3132.809 --> 3138.8390000000004
much overlooked every time it you know

3135.51 --> 3141.0
ballers love to ask this in between the

3138.839 --> 3144.42
whole set of straw man questions like

3141.0 --> 3147.68
will your models how does how do the

3144.42 --> 3150.9300000000003
seasons work on a flat earth not even

3147.68 --> 3154.109
realizing what their side of the story

3150.93 --> 3156.3489999999997
their heliocentric story actually is and

3154.109 --> 3160.38
when you really look at it how

3156.349 --> 3164.01
absolutely [ __ ] that visualization

3160.38 --> 3169.079
is how dumb and ill thought through it

3164.01 --> 3171.8390000000004
really is they always forget it it's

3169.079 --> 3174.27
that's why they never brag about their

3171.839 --> 3176.0389999999998
side of that story they just ask us oh

3174.27 --> 3180.93
how do you seasons work on the Flat

3176.039 --> 3185.19
Earth well just look how how it

3180.93 --> 3187.46
supposedly works on your globe just look

3185.19 --> 3187.46
at it

3194.759 --> 3197.759
yeah

3212.62 --> 3215.46
yep

3239.59 --> 3256.31
so all right I know I think yeah that

3253.22 --> 3258.5
subject is pretty much done for now put

3256.31 --> 3262.36
it all out there both sides of the

3258.5 --> 3264.05
explanation both my Flat Earth

3262.36 --> 3265.79
conceptualization of the seasons

3264.05 --> 3267.23
relating to the holographic nature of

3265.79 --> 3271.75
the globe of the heavens including the

3267.23 --> 3273.53
daylight's and the heliocentric

3271.75 --> 3275.48
conceptualization of what causes the

3273.53 --> 3277.7900000000004
seasons and you just compare the two in

3275.48 --> 3278.75
look what actually sounds more

3277.79 --> 3284.3
ridiculous

3278.75 --> 3291.95
and what has more m-yeah empirical proof

3284.3 --> 3297.05
or data that supports it because I'm

3291.95 --> 3302.2
pretty sure that during the winter the

3297.05 --> 3306.65
Sun is not bigger than during spring and

3302.2 --> 3309.89
autumn I'm pretty sure about that I'm

3306.65 --> 3312.17
pretty sure it's just the same size but

3309.89 --> 3315.47
hey according to the heliocentric system

3312.17 --> 3319.58
during the summer and the winter on both

3315.47 --> 3322.16
sides of the globe the Sun should be

3319.58 --> 3325.61
bigger because it's closer significantly

3322.16 --> 3328.49
closer so it doesn't actually change in

3325.61 --> 3336.1400000000003
angular size though during the season

3328.49 --> 3339.31
cycle whoops mmm tough luck

3336.14 --> 3339.31
tough luck lovers

3345.58 --> 3352.23
anyway I think I'm gonna run out the

3347.59 --> 3352.23
show it's been nice

3360.079 --> 3362.619
it

3364.309 --> 3367.309
so

3368.65 --> 3379.81
yeah to round out the show thank you

3374.74 --> 3384.0699999999997
again Randy for the p900 you you said

3379.81 --> 3389.14
you would give me I'm yeah I really hope

3384.07 --> 3393.13
that's really hoped to get it and thank

3389.14 --> 3398.23
you again for doing that I hope I can

3393.13 --> 3401.26
live up to to the work it has done in

3398.23 --> 3405.76
your possession somewhat probably not as

3401.26 --> 3409.7200000000003
much but I will do my best and thank you

3405.76 --> 3412.23
again right

3409.72 --> 3414.85
yeah there's gonna be ball busters

3412.23 --> 3420.55
there's evening no wait not ball busters

3414.85 --> 3422.23
globe busters Sunday and yeah Flat Earth

3420.55 --> 3423.67
debates gotta be tomorrow I don't know

3422.23 --> 3426.33
if rent is gonna do anything this

3423.67 --> 3430.51
