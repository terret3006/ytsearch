bill nye the science denier adam meekin

153.2 --> 158.16
jeff gas head good to see you guys

155.599 --> 158.16
clearly

158.319 --> 161.44
slo-mo moon buggy

163.36 --> 168.08
just

164.72 --> 171.08
starting a little late today

168.08 --> 171.08
because

171.36 --> 177.36
yesterday was an eventful day

174.4 --> 177.36
for me that is

179.04 --> 185.2
like on my way to groceries i broke my

181.84 --> 188.239
bicycle chain all of a sudden

185.2 --> 189.599
and it was like cold and shitty weather

188.239 --> 190.4
but

189.599 --> 192.07999999999998
yeah

190.4 --> 194.64000000000001
on the way

192.08 --> 198.48000000000002
went to bicycle repair shop

194.64 --> 200.48
and they were able to basically fix it

198.48 --> 204.23899999999998
very quickly

200.48 --> 207.2
cost me 35 euros though

204.239 --> 207.20000000000002
so yeah

207.599 --> 212.76
it's not exactly money i have as a

209.76 --> 212.76
surplus

217.44 --> 221.92
okay david hall hello

219.36 --> 223.519
thoughts about vacuum next to non-vacuum

221.92 --> 225.599
okay sure

223.519 --> 227.76
get to that

225.599 --> 229.11999999999998
uh

227.76 --> 232.48
alright but

229.12 --> 235.12
what happened was why didn't go to bed

232.48 --> 236.64
super early

235.12 --> 239.36
kind of ended up watching owen

236.64 --> 241.35999999999999
benjamin's fully even though i

239.36 --> 244.72000000000003
was very late

241.36 --> 244.72000000000003
because it was really interesting

246.0 --> 251.439
and then this morning like yeah

248.72 --> 253.35999999999999
it happens a lot of the time that like

251.439 --> 254.56
pretty early in the morning i go to the

253.36 --> 257.68
bathroom

254.56 --> 260.079
wake up go to the bathroom

257.68 --> 263.919
and this time when i did that afterward

260.079 --> 266.56
i took like a shot of iodine

263.919 --> 269.52
like as i'm still half asleep

266.56 --> 271.919
and boy did i have some like

269.52 --> 274.639
heavy dreams and [ __ ]

271.919 --> 276.88
and then i woke up like a quarter past

274.639 --> 276.88
one

280.4 --> 283.44
it basically had like an extra

282.24 --> 287.44
dimensional

283.44 --> 289.12
dating experience really weird

287.44 --> 292.08
i don't know maybe that's why i did

289.12 --> 292.08
refuse to wake up

294.639 --> 298.40000000000003
dreamt about going out with women

298.639 --> 303.12
and like studying

300.88 --> 304.24
like studying like what are they really

303.12 --> 306.4
like

304.24 --> 308.88
it's something

306.4 --> 311.59999999999997
i could say like like figure women out

308.88 --> 314.479
again but then the again part really

311.6 --> 314.47900000000004
wouldn't be fair

320.56 --> 325.84
there's tons of fe bots in chat lately

333.84 --> 338.23999999999995
yeah well there there seem to be like

336.4 --> 341.039
some standard

338.24 --> 344.24
flat earth commenting bots around at

341.039 --> 344.24
some places yeah

349.039 --> 352.759
phil is a pot

353.6 --> 359.56
all right by the way thank you that flat

355.36 --> 359.56
fellow for the 99 cents

366.88 --> 371.919
oh god sean hawkins had another stupid

369.44 --> 371.919
video

372.08 --> 377.12
using autographic view

375.039 --> 379.28
and then saying oh look it's all wrong

377.12 --> 381.84000000000003
it's accident it's all

379.28 --> 381.84
uh

383.039 --> 386.08
it's never gonna end

388.639 --> 394.28000000000003
i made by jim bob yesterday was really

391.28 --> 394.28
awesome

395.44 --> 398.96
and so was mitchell from australia by

397.28 --> 401.35999999999996
the way

398.96 --> 405.35999999999996
tenth man got on there and

401.36 --> 405.36
a very elaborate presentation

406.24 --> 409.639
it was great

416.639 --> 420.28000000000003
oh what's on this

423.599 --> 426.599
hmm

442.16 --> 444.56
ew

449.36 --> 455.52000000000004
that's that's disgusting david hall

453.759 --> 457.52000000000004
doesn't really make any sense to me if

455.52 --> 460.15999999999997
you create a vacuum somewhere it's just

457.52 --> 463.639
gonna cause it

460.16 --> 463.639
a quick implosion

487.759 --> 496.639
anyway yeah how are you guys doing it is

490.879 --> 496.639
tuesday the 30th of november 2021

496.72 --> 502.28000000000003
so yeah tomorrow's december can you

498.96 --> 502.28
believe it

508.72 --> 512.08
meanwhile out there the

513.039 --> 516.88
the c

514.24 --> 520.0
and v elites are trying to roll out a

516.88 --> 521.36
new thing

520.0 --> 523.68
it's like

521.36 --> 526.5600000000001
when that happens i usually don't even

523.68 --> 528.3199999999999
directly address it unless somebody

526.56 --> 531.04
immediately brings it up because it's

528.32 --> 532.88
like so obvious i feel stupid for even

531.04 --> 535.04
trying to share it with people oh did

532.88 --> 537.12
you know this was going on well i know

535.04 --> 538.8
there's like no way

537.12 --> 540.48
they could avoid

538.8 --> 542.959
bumping into that

540.48 --> 547.2
even on the short term so

542.959 --> 547.1999999999999
but yeah the supposed omicron

547.36 --> 551.92
right

549.68 --> 555.68
i mean i thought delta was the problem

551.92 --> 555.68
but oh no omicron it's like

555.76 --> 561.08
a new variant for every jab pretty much

563.68 --> 566.7199999999999
hello snowbirds

569.839 --> 573.7600000000001
right and it's

571.44 --> 575.839
so annoying because every time something

573.76 --> 578.08
like that happens alex jones goes all

575.839 --> 579.36
super squirty over it and it's oh so

578.08 --> 581.44
serious

579.36 --> 583.279
and he still even addresses like yeah

581.44 --> 586.48
it's mind control

583.279 --> 589.92
it's all just fake it's mind control but

586.48 --> 591.6
it's a real virus oh that's so real oh

589.92 --> 593.4399999999999
it's still dangerous they're still

591.6 --> 594.8000000000001
spraying it it's

593.44 --> 597.12
like

594.8 --> 597.12
ugh

598.399 --> 604.24
it's annoying

600.399 --> 608.48
but to me it's quite obvious that he is

604.24 --> 608.48
still trying to reify some real

609.68 --> 614.0
disease

611.279 --> 617.04
that's doing something outside of

614.0 --> 619.12
people that took jabs

617.04 --> 622.079
other than just the flu

619.12 --> 622.079
which i think it is

623.68 --> 629.279
and the flu always can be

626.16 --> 631.04
like weird and unexpected forms that

629.279 --> 632.72
suddenly pop up

631.04 --> 636.16
the way it manifests

632.72 --> 640.72
but that's always been like that

636.16 --> 642.88
very very rarely a reason to panic

640.72 --> 645.36
and especially all these measures is

642.88 --> 647.519
just preposterous that that doesn't help

645.36 --> 650.519
at all

647.519 --> 650.519
anyway

661.36 --> 667.04
the true sign of intelligence is not

663.44 --> 667.0400000000001
knowledge but imagination

670.64 --> 674.8
that's

671.6 --> 678.88
a weird thing to say

674.8 --> 678.88
i mean it's almost true

679.68 --> 683.5999999999999
but i think that's like no

684.8 --> 691.3599999999999
the true sign of intelligence is that

687.519 --> 694.0
you have mastery over the imagination

691.36 --> 694.0
but still

694.72 --> 699.9200000000001
have plenty of knowledge to reflect on

698.48 --> 702.9200000000001
because otherwise you're just a

699.92 --> 702.92
fantasist

704.24 --> 708.399
if you have nothing to anchor your

706.24 --> 710.64
imagination with in the real world you

708.399 --> 710.64
know

711.12 --> 719.2
come and say that to my unfacts what

714.88 --> 723.72
oh at least at least she uh

719.2 --> 723.72
she's envied adam meekin

734.56 --> 740.16
yeah gadgets but nobody they never did

738.24 --> 743.12
make sense it's

740.16 --> 744.88
it's like conditioning programs under

743.12 --> 747.04
the guise of some

744.88 --> 748.88
virtual threat

747.04 --> 750.639
that's what they're doing it's happening

748.88 --> 751.8389999999999
over here in the netherlands again as

750.639 --> 754.16
well

751.839 --> 756.1600000000001
seem to be new

754.16 --> 758.56
like they're just recycling the [ __ ]

756.16 --> 759.76
they tried before

758.56 --> 762.3199999999999
so now

759.76 --> 763.4399999999999
like a lots of people are wearing masks

762.32 --> 766.0790000000001
again

763.44 --> 768.5600000000001
and i am not except for like the one

766.079 --> 772.519
coffee shop because the owner like

768.56 --> 772.5189999999999
insists on it because

772.639 --> 779.04
he's a nutty he realizes

776.8 --> 779.04
like

779.6 --> 784.399
i basically tried to explain like no you

782.48 --> 786.399
can't get fined

784.399 --> 789.2
like the shop owner can't get that's not

786.399 --> 792.399
how it works this time

789.2 --> 795.839
it's like the person themselves risks of

792.399 --> 797.6
getting a fine if they don't wear a mask

795.839 --> 798.639
right

797.6 --> 800.72
but

798.639 --> 802.48
it just doesn't care but all other

800.72 --> 804.0
plates i don't wear masks like i'm

802.48 --> 805.76
wearing masks still in the grocery shore

804.0 --> 807.04
almost everybody now is wearing masks

805.76 --> 807.92
again and it's like

807.04 --> 813.0
yeah

807.92 --> 813.0
i what can you do but laugh about it

814.399 --> 819.36
and basically joke around a bit like

816.399 --> 820.959
yeah yeah they told us it doesn't work

819.36 --> 822.5600000000001
like

820.959 --> 826.3199999999999
the ones that are now saying we have to

822.56 --> 828.399
do it again they told us it doesn't work

826.32 --> 831.0400000000001
and yet everybody's still

828.399 --> 833.04
doing it again because they got word

831.04 --> 834.8
that they're supposed to do it again

833.04 --> 837.76
without actually

834.8 --> 840.0
critically inquiring

837.76 --> 841.68
background information because that's

840.0 --> 843.839
what a lot of people do

841.68 --> 843.8389999999999
here

844.72 --> 848.88
i'm not doing that

847.6 --> 851.0400000000001
and i'm getting

848.88 --> 853.36
appreciative looks too because yeah i

851.04 --> 857.92
was my bike chain broke

853.36 --> 860.8000000000001
i walked the the rest of the groceries

857.92 --> 863.68
and yeah i got quite a few

860.8 --> 864.8
interesting looks from women which might

863.68 --> 866.8
be

864.8 --> 870.519
also what kind of spurred the dream

866.8 --> 870.519
event this morning

872.0 --> 876.32
because yeah i'm walking around

874.24 --> 879.36
in my black coat

876.32 --> 880.48
with my mustache very confident very

879.36 --> 884.0790000000001
driven

880.48 --> 888.48
and yeah that drew some eyes

884.079 --> 888.4799999999999
got some interesting eye contact moments

889.44 --> 894.1600000000001
and that usually makes quite an

891.279 --> 894.16
impression on me

896.72 --> 901.6
people break the rules face a fine yeah

899.199 --> 902.639
well i got an exemption card anyway and

901.6 --> 903.44
that's

902.639 --> 907.32
like

903.44 --> 907.32
it's government issue

916.88 --> 921.4399999999999
are you getting wisdom

919.12 --> 921.44
bry

922.48 --> 927.399
going to the pub for a haircut what

943.199 --> 949.279
david i have no idea what you're talking

945.36 --> 954.519
about but it sounds all really messed up

949.279 --> 954.519
but i guess i expect that from you now

969.759 --> 973.6
hey eric one one one one

978.079 --> 981.56
your band

986.079 --> 990.4399999999999
don't try sneaking back in

1008.079 --> 1011.079
ah

1017.92 --> 1020.7199999999999
look who's there

1020.959 --> 1027.6789999999999
mr jones

1023.199 --> 1027.6789999999999
long time no see can't say i missed you

1037.76 --> 1042.559
right yeah mr jones considering that

1041.12 --> 1045.6789999999999
our evidence

1042.559 --> 1049.84
is supported by black swan and

1045.679 --> 1052.72
geometric application of sextants i say

1049.84 --> 1054.8799999999999
that the flat earth for evidence is very

1052.72 --> 1056.48
straight to the point in literally in

1054.88 --> 1059.2
your face

1056.48 --> 1061.28
because we assume things are where we

1059.2 --> 1063.679
see them

1061.28 --> 1067.36
now the globe on the other hand

1063.679 --> 1068.64
the evidence for that is quite elusive

1067.36 --> 1070.7199999999998
because

1068.64 --> 1072.4
in the face of the arguments from the

1070.72 --> 1074.72
flat earth side

1072.4 --> 1076.96
you have to start assuming that things

1074.72 --> 1078.84
are not where you see them

1076.96 --> 1081.8400000000001
in order to justify

1078.84 --> 1086.0
the spherical geometry that

1081.84 --> 1086.0
is not accounted for in observations

1086.799 --> 1090.24
the next one has been the yeah but how

1089.039 --> 1092.559
you know

1090.24 --> 1095.2
there's only one way to

1092.559 --> 1097.84
see bigly debunk is and that is to

1095.2 --> 1100.4
assume terrestrial refraction

1097.84 --> 1103.36
which leaves you with an intangible r

1100.4 --> 1106.24
value that you can no longer establish

1103.36 --> 1109.6
except for mathematical derivation of

1106.24 --> 1112.24
transverse distance which is not is

1109.6 --> 1115.1999999999998
circumstantial evidence at best

1112.24 --> 1115.2
it's not really

1115.44 --> 1119.2
a geometric measurement

1117.84 --> 1121.84
because you're just transversing

1119.2 --> 1124.32
distance and then making an assumption

1121.84 --> 1125.28
over that right that's the best you

1124.32 --> 1127.76
could do

1125.28 --> 1130.559
so you can say it's been debunked but

1127.76 --> 1132.4
the thing is you can't really

1130.559 --> 1135.12
debunk

1132.4 --> 1137.6000000000001
the argument

1135.12 --> 1140.2399999999998
the argument is this set up

1137.6 --> 1142.9599999999998
like geometric consequences

1140.24 --> 1145.52
of course assuming that what you see is

1142.96 --> 1148.4
exactly where it is

1145.52 --> 1151.84
the only way to bypass that is to assume

1148.4 --> 1151.8400000000001
things are not where you see them

1155.36 --> 1162.1999999999998
yeah you're not listening

1157.76 --> 1162.2
shouldn't be expecting you to listen

1165.76 --> 1170.48
i have debunked to claim that in fact no

1168.0 --> 1173.6
that's [ __ ] david hall

1170.48 --> 1176.48
now it's not like a moment where there

1173.6 --> 1180.6399999999999
is low pressure and oh pressure the the

1176.48 --> 1183.28
the point is the pers a persistent

1180.64 --> 1185.8400000000001
vacuum right the vacuum

1183.28 --> 1188.08
out there in supposed outer space is

1185.84 --> 1190.3999999999999
there all the time

1188.08 --> 1192.32
and it's extremely strong

1190.4 --> 1194.0800000000002
and the gas pressure here on earth is

1192.32 --> 1195.039
here all the time

1194.08 --> 1197.36
that's

1195.039 --> 1199.52
the setup

1197.36 --> 1202.32
that the house creep keeping question is

1199.52 --> 1204.559
about not like oh can you temporarily

1202.32 --> 1206.1589999999999
create a vacuum yeah sure temporarily

1204.559 --> 1208.1589999999999
and then

1206.159 --> 1210.5590000000002
you break the barrier between the vacuum

1208.159 --> 1213.6000000000001
and the gas pressure the

1210.559 --> 1216.8799999999999
general air and it immediately

1213.6 --> 1220.36
fills the available volume of the vacuum

1216.88 --> 1220.3600000000001
that's the point

1230.0 --> 1234.72
how about brian's leprechauns

1232.559 --> 1237.12
structures i haven't heard about him

1234.72 --> 1240.559
about that in a while

1237.12 --> 1240.559
i think he's still holding on

1240.96 --> 1245.8400000000001
like what he's going through reminds me

1243.2 --> 1247.1200000000001
a ton about when i was still stuck on

1245.84 --> 1249.52
gravity

1247.12 --> 1251.6789999999999
it's like yeah

1249.52 --> 1254.08
it's not the sphere gravity but it's

1251.679 --> 1257.3600000000001
still like a

1254.08 --> 1258.96
well like a one directional gravity

1257.36 --> 1262.6399999999999
i was still holding on to that for a

1258.96 --> 1264.96
very long time i i fought for that

1262.64 --> 1266.96
not as balwin by the way that was before

1264.96 --> 1269.2
that

1266.96 --> 1269.2
so

1274.48 --> 1277.48
uh

1277.52 --> 1283.12
is the current claim

1280.48 --> 1285.919
is the current claim is that that's not

1283.12 --> 1290.08
a proper sentence but yeah

1285.919 --> 1294.5590000000002
supposedly the moon is still slightly

1290.08 --> 1297.1999999999998
presupposed as an object slightly within

1294.559 --> 1299.36
the upper riches of the atmosphere where

1297.2 --> 1302.4
it's very very thin because it keeps

1299.36 --> 1302.3999999999999
gradiating out

1303.12 --> 1307.9599999999998
that's that's the claim then lenox

1320.0 --> 1324.0
nathan needs to add persistent no no

1322.64 --> 1326.4
david hall

1324.0 --> 1329.36
because

1326.4 --> 1332.24
it's not necessary to even say that

1329.36 --> 1334.3999999999999
because nathan is

1332.24 --> 1336.24
in his housekeeping question is asking

1334.4 --> 1338.96
about a natural

1336.24 --> 1341.679
occurring phenomena and you can't even

1338.96 --> 1344.24
emulate that

1341.679 --> 1347.039
right as soon as you create a vacuum in

1344.24 --> 1349.28
a man-made vacuum chamber

1347.039 --> 1352.08
you're already unable to attain the

1349.28 --> 1352.08
proof because

1353.039 --> 1356.52
it's not scientific

1360.32 --> 1364.48
well although i don't know if yeah maybe

1362.48 --> 1367.76
maybe you should

1364.48 --> 1367.76
put persistent in there

1368.08 --> 1373.24
but

1368.799 --> 1373.24
i don't know we all get it

1380.08 --> 1383.6
i mean yeah

1381.76 --> 1385.36
it's not like ballers are constantly

1383.6 --> 1387.12
coming in like oh but you can't create a

1385.36 --> 1389.039
vacuum see it's right there it's just

1387.12 --> 1391.039
for that

1389.039 --> 1392.08
tenth of a second

1391.039 --> 1394.1589999999999
it

1392.08 --> 1396.0
no they don't do that

1394.159 --> 1398.24
because everybody already

1396.0 --> 1403.48
understands kind of the premise of the

1398.24 --> 1403.48
question the housekeeping question so

1406.48 --> 1409.76
no

1407.36 --> 1411.9189999999999
no david hall

1409.76 --> 1416.039
i don't think so

1411.919 --> 1416.039
8th frank drebin

1419.6 --> 1424.1589999999999
when i get ben for asking question

1422.08 --> 1426.32
constant pressure at mount everest what

1424.159 --> 1428.5590000000002
oh you mean the gradient that can only

1426.32 --> 1430.6399999999999
exist because

1428.559 --> 1434.24
the available volume

1430.64 --> 1436.7990000000002
is already filled with the gas

1434.24 --> 1438.559
and then can gradiate out as a secondary

1436.799 --> 1440.1589999999999
effect yeah

1438.559 --> 1444.039
now you're not going to get banned for

1440.159 --> 1444.0390000000002
just bringing that up

1472.4 --> 1476.72
yeah but it doesn't david hall it

1474.32 --> 1478.32
doesn't exist in a circumstance that's

1476.72 --> 1483.039
the whole point

1478.32 --> 1485.2
any actual vacuum next to non-vacuum gas

1483.039 --> 1486.64
will immediately dissipate as soon as

1485.2 --> 1489.76
the barriers

1486.64 --> 1491.279
that allow that vacuum to persist

1489.76 --> 1493.44
are taken away

1491.279 --> 1496.32
that's the point

1493.44 --> 1497.76
that what you describe is like a false

1496.32 --> 1499.6
assumption of

1497.76 --> 1502.48
the setup

1499.6 --> 1502.48
that doesn't happen

1504.799 --> 1508.24
this is not about can you create vacuum

1506.96 --> 1511.1200000000001
chambers

1508.24 --> 1515.0
and keep them vacated yeah you can that

1511.12 --> 1515.0
doesn't actually prove

1515.679 --> 1521.52
the gas sticking to a ball in an

1517.84 --> 1521.52
infinite outer space vacuum

1527.52 --> 1532.0
exit velocity to go beyond the karma

1535.76 --> 1540.24
i don't know len lenox

1538.08 --> 1542.3999999999999
it's all quite surreal how that

1540.24 --> 1545.2
supposedly works they they kind of like

1542.4 --> 1546.48
treat gas conceptually in their mind

1545.2 --> 1549.039
even i think

1546.48 --> 1551.3600000000001
like a liquid you know they

1549.039 --> 1553.84
they go to the fluid

1551.36 --> 1554.799
idea and then they just imagine how it's

1553.84 --> 1557.52
like

1554.799 --> 1559.679
just like water

1557.52 --> 1561.52
versus the air they imagine the air

1559.679 --> 1564.72
versus the vacuum just

1561.52 --> 1564.72
hanging in there and then

1567.52 --> 1572.08
like when it

1569.039 --> 1575.039
when it just loses that critical mass

1572.08 --> 1576.8799999999999
pull from the gravity because

1575.039 --> 1579.2
like there's more gas and then it

1576.88 --> 1581.3600000000001
escapes like a

1579.2 --> 1584.24
like a plume just escapes because the

1581.36 --> 1586.24
gravity is just not enough for it to

1584.24 --> 1588.159
prevent it from escaping something like

1586.24 --> 1591.76
that i don't know man

1588.159 --> 1591.7600000000002
it's also weird

1596.48 --> 1602.48
no david hall it doesn't

1599.679 --> 1603.8400000000001
yeah i'm glad you think you could help

1602.48 --> 1605.44
with that

1603.84 --> 1606.72
no

1605.44 --> 1608.88
i already

1606.72 --> 1612.679
explained to you

1608.88 --> 1612.679
why that's unnecessary

1624.88 --> 1631.72
hey rachner stefan hellerson

1627.52 --> 1631.72
yeah long time no see indeed

1640.08 --> 1645.6
you're seeking star water also there is

1642.0 --> 1645.6
no evaporation in a bottle

1647.2 --> 1649.44
uh

1651.84 --> 1655.9189999999999
well if it's hot

1653.44 --> 1657.919
perhaps it's a bit closed off bottle

1655.919 --> 1660.5590000000002
it's hot

1657.919 --> 1663.2
but yeah evaporation will

1660.559 --> 1666.76
cause also the gas pressure

1663.2 --> 1666.76
to become higher

1669.039 --> 1671.44
anyway

1672.88 --> 1679.7600000000002
do you think the moon is real no

1677.44 --> 1681.6000000000001
it's a hologram

1679.76 --> 1683.84
i'm just gonna say it like that so you

1681.6 --> 1686.6399999999999
can have like your giant

1683.84 --> 1688.399
train of thought squirt response as all

1686.64 --> 1690.48
ballers do every time

1688.399 --> 1692.7199999999998
makes you feel really smart when a flat

1690.48 --> 1694.159
earther says no the moon is a hologram

1692.72 --> 1697.679
just like that

1694.159 --> 1699.3600000000001
not carefully explaining it

1697.679 --> 1701.679
just say it like that

1699.36 --> 1703.279
and then you can

1701.679 --> 1705.279
think

1703.279 --> 1707.2
for a period that you're smart for

1705.279 --> 1710.399
having heard that a flat earther said

1707.2 --> 1713.039
the moon is a hologram

1710.399 --> 1716.4799999999998
and that that's supposedly so stupid and

1713.039 --> 1716.48
that's fine you can think that

1720.48 --> 1724.08
why are there

1721.84 --> 1726.48
because they aren't they're not shadows

1724.08 --> 1728.72
they just seem like shadows

1726.48 --> 1731.2
that's the point you can

1728.72 --> 1733.919
create an illusion of a shadow within

1731.2 --> 1733.919
the hologram

1735.2 --> 1742.679
you can create shadow play in an

1738.399 --> 1742.6789999999999
apparent image in a hologram

1755.76 --> 1758.0
what

1759.24 --> 1766.039
electromagnetic scars what are you

1761.679 --> 1766.039
talking about seeking star wars

1801.6 --> 1804.32
white swan

1806.559 --> 1812.96
dude mr jones

1809.039 --> 1816.559
by saying white swan just saying that

1812.96 --> 1818.32
immediately proves without a doubt

1816.559 --> 1820.6399999999999
for those who actually understand the

1818.32 --> 1824.24
black swan argument that you don't

1820.64 --> 1824.24
understand the blackstone argument

1824.559 --> 1831.44
right when you say white swan

1828.0 --> 1833.52
in response to a black swan claim

1831.44 --> 1835.52
you immediately prove you do not

1833.52 --> 1837.84
understand what the black swan argument

1835.52 --> 1837.84
is

1839.36 --> 1843.4399999999998
i think that most in the chat here know

1841.52 --> 1845.44
that by now

1843.44 --> 1849.799
even the ballers

1845.44 --> 1849.799
that have stuck around for a while

1856.24 --> 1865.84
we bounce lasers of the move right yes

1861.679 --> 1865.8400000000001
sure i'm sure you did it yourself

1874.799 --> 1879.84
yeah that's right bill nye the science

1876.32 --> 1879.84
denier you get it

1882.48 --> 1887.0
pink ducks next what

1896.399 --> 1901.9189999999999
bounce lasers

1898.96 --> 1904.24
they did did they actually show it bill

1901.919 --> 1907.039
my designs deny or

1904.24 --> 1910.159
did they just say

1907.039 --> 1912.48
oh yeah we bounce lasers of the moon

1910.159 --> 1916.3200000000002
i mean back in the 50s people would be

1912.48 --> 1916.32
very impressed by even a claim

1919.519 --> 1922.64
so

1920.48 --> 1924.159
try it dude

1922.64 --> 1927.3600000000001
up

1924.159 --> 1929.8400000000001
dude i made an entire item about that mr

1927.36 --> 1930.7199999999998
jones an entire item

1929.84 --> 1932.8799999999999
like

1930.72 --> 1935.76
how do you actually test whether there

1932.88 --> 1937.6000000000001
is a signal rebounds

1935.76 --> 1939.679
from the moon

1937.6 --> 1941.84
specifically

1939.679 --> 1943.519
how do you prove that there is no proof

1941.84 --> 1946.8799999999999
of this

1943.519 --> 1950.559
and the setup is very

1946.88 --> 1953.0390000000002
easy to perform

1950.559 --> 1956.96
but you need several cameras to actually

1953.039 --> 1956.96
prove that you are indeed

1957.039 --> 1963.039
well receiving a signal rebounds that

1960.24 --> 1965.679
directly coordinates with the apparent

1963.039 --> 1968.399
position of the moon within

1965.679 --> 1970.48
view of the same setup that's why you

1968.399 --> 1972.799
need multiple cameras

1970.48 --> 1973.679
right to actually prove that's a real

1972.799 --> 1977.039
thing

1973.679 --> 1980.3990000000001
i have never seen a single example ever

1977.039 --> 1982.799
and yeah that's since the 50s right it's

1980.399 --> 1984.8799999999999
quite a long time 70 years i've never

1982.799 --> 1987.76
seen a single

1984.88 --> 1989.1200000000001
demonstration that actually

1987.76 --> 1992.64
gives

1989.12 --> 1996.0
room to the idea that a radio signal can

1992.64 --> 1998.72
actually be bounced off the moon somehow

1996.0 --> 2000.96
never seen one single demonstration

1998.72 --> 2003.2
that's actually a demonstration not just

2000.96 --> 2005.679
a still shot of like oh look there's a

2003.2 --> 2007.039
readout oh it's aiming at the wound even

2005.679 --> 2009.8400000000001
though you don't even see the moon in

2007.039 --> 2012.08
the shot and you don't see how this it's

2009.84 --> 2014.24
varied right oh pointed away from the

2012.08 --> 2016.399
moon oh there's no signal pointed at the

2014.24 --> 2018.799
moon again oh there's a signal well then

2016.399 --> 2022.0
you got a phenomenon now you got

2018.799 --> 2025.039
something interesting never seen that

2022.0 --> 2026.88
and that includes by the people claiming

2025.039 --> 2027.84
you can do that

2026.88 --> 2030.3990000000001
okay

2027.84 --> 2034.32
it doesn't exist

2030.399 --> 2036.4799999999998
if it does find it for me

2034.32 --> 2038.6399999999999
exactly the way i said it

2036.48 --> 2040.72
it should not be difficult if that's a

2038.64 --> 2042.88
real thing

2040.72 --> 2047.679
you can't trick it if that's a real

2042.88 --> 2051.04
thing it's called rid of shut up

2047.679 --> 2053.119
can't just radar

2051.04 --> 2055.919
in your backyard buddy

2053.119 --> 2055.9190000000003
it's ridiculous

2057.28 --> 2063.679
i can't just get a radar to test that's

2060.399 --> 2063.679
absolutely preposterous

2064.56 --> 2069.2
it's claimed that people could do it

2066.399 --> 2070.0
with radio transmitters ham radio i

2069.2 --> 2072.3199999999997
think

2070.0 --> 2075.44
themselves here on earth it's claimed

2072.32 --> 2079.2400000000002
right now even though nobody's actually

2075.44 --> 2079.2400000000002
demonstrated it

2089.599 --> 2094.7200000000003
yeah radio club exactly yeah the plenty

2092.8 --> 2096.8790000000004
of claims

2094.72 --> 2099.7599999999998
claims you can do it say you could do it

2096.879 --> 2103.1189999999997
oh i got a ham radio i did it

2099.76 --> 2106.4
but you never actually get to see

2103.119 --> 2110.079
them do it and like beyond a doubt show

2106.4 --> 2113.28
that yeah like oh the moon is over there

2110.079 --> 2115.28
okay let's take this radio thing

2113.28 --> 2116.8
even at the moon oh look at the signal

2115.28 --> 2118.8
reader

2116.8 --> 2120.48
i'm pointing away

2118.8 --> 2121.52
pointing at the moon

2120.48 --> 2123.119
right

2121.52 --> 2125.04
that's proof

2123.119 --> 2128.56
that is actual

2125.04 --> 2130.48
demonstration never seen it ever

2128.56 --> 2132.0
and i've put this

2130.48 --> 2135.04
down

2132.0 --> 2136.4
on camera several times for at least two

2135.04 --> 2138.16
years

2136.4 --> 2139.839
probably more

2138.16 --> 2142.3999999999996
because yeah the subject

2139.839 --> 2146.0789999999997
has come up quite a few times

2142.4 --> 2149.2000000000003
build it myself now you see i have no

2146.079 --> 2151.04
direct interest

2149.2 --> 2153.2
to prove

2151.04 --> 2155.2799999999997
that it's a real thing you see it's not

2153.2 --> 2158.3199999999997
my claim

2155.28 --> 2161.8390000000004
that you can actually bounce a signal of

2158.32 --> 2164.48
the moon that's baller claims

2161.839 --> 2167.2
they say it's a possibility

2164.48 --> 2170.64
so they should demonstrate that because

2167.2 --> 2174.3199999999997
it's in their interest not mine

2170.64 --> 2176.56
you see mr jones it's not in my interest

2174.32 --> 2179.52
to do that i am not going to

2176.56 --> 2179.52
spend money

2180.4 --> 2183.2000000000003
to do that

2184.4 --> 2192.2400000000002
why don't you do it you seem to be very

2188.16 --> 2192.24
interested in proving it do it

2192.64 --> 2196.48
it's your claim that the moon is a

2194.24 --> 2200.2
holocaust yeah but if if i might claim

2196.48 --> 2200.2
that the moon is a hologram

2203.359 --> 2210.16
what i have to prove that it doesn't

2205.599 --> 2210.1600000000003
rebound dude you know how easy that is

2213.119 --> 2217.2000000000003
like

2214.4 --> 2217.2000000000003
it's pointless

2218.079 --> 2222.1600000000003
it's very easy to take some radio

2220.16 --> 2226.0
transmitter aim it at a bunch of stuff

2222.16 --> 2226.0
and then not get a signal rebound

2227.44 --> 2232.7200000000003
it's i could very easily just show how

2230.48 --> 2235.359
it doesn't work like i don't even have

2232.72 --> 2239.68
to get complicated

2235.359 --> 2239.68
probably but i have no interest in doing

2240.839 --> 2245.92
that i'm actually more interested in

2244.079 --> 2249.44
what if it actually worked what if you

2245.92 --> 2250.88
could bounce a signal off the moon maybe

2249.44 --> 2253.92
you could

2250.88 --> 2256.7200000000003
maybe the hologram has some

2253.92 --> 2258.7200000000003
unforeseen influence i mean

2256.72 --> 2262.3999999999996
you don't even realize that if there is

2258.72 --> 2263.4399999999996
a radio signal rebound somehow

2262.4 --> 2266.96
with the

2263.44 --> 2269.28
angular position of the moon

2266.96 --> 2272.7200000000003
it doesn't necessarily prove to me it's

2269.28 --> 2275.52
a physical object it just gives a

2272.72 --> 2277.9199999999996
starting point where you might start to

2275.52 --> 2279.92
assume something like that you see

2277.92 --> 2282.8
because other than that there is no hint

2279.92 --> 2284.32
whatsoever there's only optical

2282.8 --> 2286.4
suggestions

2284.32 --> 2287.76
due to the nature of the hologram of the

2286.4 --> 2290.1600000000003
moon

2287.76 --> 2293.1600000000003
and yeah it's a hologram so that's

2290.16 --> 2293.16
pointless

2306.56 --> 2311.96
how did i come well yeah

2308.96 --> 2311.96
dude

2312.4 --> 2318.4
just watch my streams

2315.359 --> 2320.96
how did i come to that conclusion

2318.4 --> 2324.48
well due to the appearance

2320.96 --> 2328.0
due to the angular consistency

2324.48 --> 2329.68
and due to the complete lacking

2328.0 --> 2333.2
of

2329.68 --> 2333.2
application of perspective

2333.28 --> 2337.28
right which is by the way also the

2335.28 --> 2341.0400000000004
angular consistency because the angular

2337.28 --> 2344.48
speed of the celestials don't change

2341.04 --> 2346.88
during a single pathway ever

2344.48 --> 2350.72
that means

2346.88 --> 2350.7200000000003
yeah perspective isn't applying

2350.96 --> 2356.2400000000002
and perspective applying is kind of

2353.359 --> 2360.56
necessary in order to

2356.24 --> 2363.4399999999996
start anchoring down a visual phenomenon

2360.56 --> 2366.24
into euclidean space like that's what

2363.44 --> 2369.28
you require in order to prove actual

2366.24 --> 2371.5989999999997
position based nature

2369.28 --> 2373.8390000000004
of an object

2371.599 --> 2376.8
so that was kind of the start and just

2373.839 --> 2379.119
the way it appears also the

2376.8 --> 2380.96
ripple in the moon that crow triple 7

2379.119 --> 2382.96
shot

2380.96 --> 2384.0
a long time ago now

2382.96 --> 2387.2
and

2384.0 --> 2388.24
other weird phenomena like

2387.2 --> 2390.48
the moon

2388.24 --> 2392.72
never going down

2390.48 --> 2395.119
it just disappears

2392.72 --> 2397.9199999999996
right before it touches the horizon it

2395.119 --> 2398.96
just disappears it doesn't actually go

2397.92 --> 2401.2000000000003
down

2398.96 --> 2403.52
apparently like the sun does another

2401.2 --> 2407.68
hint right there's many hints of a

2403.52 --> 2411.4
holographic nature weird little things

2407.68 --> 2411.3999999999996
ah she's just whining

2429.28 --> 2435.52
yeah hey david hall i got i got a tip

2431.68 --> 2439.2799999999997
for you stop talking about your freaking

2435.52 --> 2442.88
bombs and [ __ ] yeah this is not

2439.28 --> 2445.3590000000004
a military tactical forum

2442.88 --> 2448.2400000000002
right i don't care about your freaking

2445.359 --> 2450.0
weapons of mass destruction obsession

2448.24 --> 2451.2
how you want to slaughter everyone and

2450.0 --> 2453.839
everything

2451.2 --> 2453.839
okay

2454.56 --> 2460.44
if this is going to be a daily

2455.839 --> 2460.44
occurrence i am going to ban you

2469.52 --> 2472.52
so

2480.319 --> 2485.839
i don't want to interact with somebody

2482.56 --> 2488.4
that just 24 7 things about mass

2485.839 --> 2490.0789999999997
destruction and murder and torture all

2488.4 --> 2494.04
the time yeah

2490.079 --> 2494.04
i don't need that here

2495.68 --> 2499.1189999999997
didn't you say the sun is also

2497.04 --> 2500.96
holographic yes indeed

2499.119 --> 2502.56
the same thing

2500.96 --> 2504.079
and there's weird

2502.56 --> 2505.68
phenomena

2504.079 --> 2509.28
with that as well

2505.68 --> 2511.7599999999998
like crepustricular ray-based shadows

2509.28 --> 2513.52
how one observer will see the light

2511.76 --> 2516.079
beams

2513.52 --> 2518.64
hit like right in front of them and then

2516.079 --> 2520.8
another observer in another location for

2518.64 --> 2522.72
example like on the mountainside a mile

2520.8 --> 2525.2000000000003
away or more

2522.72 --> 2527.52
looks with his binoculars towards the

2525.2 --> 2529.16
position of the first person and he will

2527.52 --> 2532.24
not see those

2529.16 --> 2534.48
prospuscular ray beams hit those same

2532.24 --> 2537.52
locations as the first person that's

2534.48 --> 2541.119
another hint another hint

2537.52 --> 2541.119
as to a holographic nature

2541.28 --> 2548.6400000000003
because that doesn't happen

2544.96 --> 2551.839
with lights that are actually in literal

2548.64 --> 2551.839
euclidean positions

2551.92 --> 2558.079
shadows cast by euclidean based

2555.68 --> 2561.2799999999997
world anchored lights

2558.079 --> 2563.6800000000003
when observed their shadows and whatever

2561.28 --> 2566.3190000000004
from another position it will always be

2563.68 --> 2569.04
in the exact same position

2566.319 --> 2572.96
to any other observers

2569.04 --> 2572.96
so there's another hint for you

2573.04 --> 2579.72
can a hologram give off heat yes it can

2576.72 --> 2579.72
absolutely

2581.28 --> 2586.88
or rather the light

2583.76 --> 2589.599
with with which it is formed can also

2586.88 --> 2592.319
contain heat that when absorbed yeah

2589.599 --> 2595.119
will basically give off heat because

2592.319 --> 2596.96
there's no hologram literally radiating

2595.119 --> 2599.44
heat like a radiator

2596.96 --> 2601.92
there's no proximity heat

2599.44 --> 2604.8
but the light that can make up a

2601.92 --> 2607.2000000000003
hologram can definitely contain

2604.8 --> 2611.92
well infrared

2607.2 --> 2611.9199999999996
which when absorbed translates into heat

2612.0 --> 2615.0
yes

2626.24 --> 2630.64
our gram can give off enough heat to

2628.24 --> 2632.0789999999997
warm planet well yeah if it has enough

2630.64 --> 2635.0789999999997
energy

2632.079 --> 2635.079
yes

2637.2 --> 2640.5989999999997
thank the designer

2664.8 --> 2668.5600000000004
okay david hall fine

2669.92 --> 2677.48
i just don't think that any kind of

2672.56 --> 2677.48
special bomb is gonna prove anything

2681.52 --> 2685.92
who's the design

2683.04 --> 2688.24
dude stop asking like a six-year-old

2685.92 --> 2693.0
dude

2688.24 --> 2693.0
i'm not your kindergarten teacher okay

2706.96 --> 2709.96
so

2736.319 --> 2740.88
that's what seekers of truth yeah but

2738.079 --> 2742.96
he's not a seeker of truth mr jones is a

2740.88 --> 2745.2000000000003
whiny baller

2742.96 --> 2748.0
that just scatter guns questions he's

2745.2 --> 2752.3999999999996
just rambling rambling rambling rambling

2748.0 --> 2754.8
trying to tire a flat earther out

2752.4 --> 2757.599
so that he can

2754.8 --> 2760.2400000000002
put it to rest and forget about all of

2757.599 --> 2762.88
it again that's why they constantly do

2760.24 --> 2765.04
the same routine over and over again not

2762.88 --> 2766.8
because they're assimilating information

2765.04 --> 2768.24
because they're actually inquiring

2766.8 --> 2770.48
information

2768.24 --> 2773.839
it's because they want to just tire you

2770.48 --> 2776.48
out so they can still feel victorious

2773.839 --> 2778.72
afterward when they can just easily

2776.48 --> 2780.88
forget everything again

2778.72 --> 2784.24
like thousands of times and that's why

2780.88 --> 2787.04
they always go the same stupid route in

2784.24 --> 2789.1189999999997
their basic six-year-old question

2787.04 --> 2792.8
routine it's because they forget

2789.119 --> 2794.48
everything immediately

2792.8 --> 2796.6400000000003
they just want to give that same

2794.48 --> 2798.319
responsibility oh holy crap oh holy crap

2796.64 --> 2799.839
i've never heard of a hologram what is a

2798.319 --> 2802.079
hologram

2799.839 --> 2805.2
like how does that work yeah yeah i've

2802.079 --> 2807.599
said it like thousands of times you know

2805.2 --> 2809.04
over the last few years thousands of

2807.599 --> 2811.839
times

2809.04 --> 2816.2799999999997
you just want to forget it all again so

2811.839 --> 2816.2799999999997
that's fine just piss off

2823.44 --> 2826.44
uh

2835.04 --> 2840.119
shut the [ __ ] up dude stop whining

2847.839 --> 2851.2799999999997
sky is full of electricity well there is

2849.92 --> 2853.04
definitely

2851.28 --> 2856.48
electrical energy

2853.04 --> 2856.48
absolutely charlie welsh

2856.72 --> 2861.2799999999997
right could be considered the electric

2858.88 --> 2861.28
ether

2861.359 --> 2865.92
there is energy there so if there is

2863.359 --> 2868.4
energy there then

2865.92 --> 2871.2000000000003
maybe there's more

2868.4 --> 2874.079
right maybe more high up out of reach

2871.2 --> 2877.2799999999997
there is even more energy

2874.079 --> 2877.28
can't really measure it

2877.44 --> 2882.16
right you have to put a stick in it to

2879.52 --> 2884.96
measure that

2882.16 --> 2887.359
but yeah if you can't reach that stick

2884.96 --> 2890.8
far enough then you can't measure it you

2887.359 --> 2890.7999999999997
can't measure how much is there

2893.44 --> 2898.839
no such thing as an ether oh yeah just

2895.92 --> 2901.76
hand wave dismiss it why not i

2898.839 --> 2904.4
mean you already know exactly what i'm

2901.76 --> 2907.92
talking about are you right or you're

2904.4 --> 2907.92
just going bagok

2908.319 --> 2914.16
trigger response

2910.24 --> 2918.0789999999997
immediately hand wave dismiss it

2914.16 --> 2918.0789999999997
you probably don't even know what it is

2921.359 --> 2925.2
but i think you probably heard einstein

2923.44 --> 2927.119
say at some point that it didn't exist

2925.2 --> 2930.48
for some reason so

2927.119 --> 2930.48
that's why you just say that

2931.599 --> 2936.319
hand waving no charlie wells get the

2933.599 --> 2936.319
[ __ ] out of here

2941.44 --> 2946.96
i've not hand wave dismissed a single

2944.24 --> 2949.5989999999997
thing i don't hand wave dismiss

2946.96 --> 2952.2400000000002
i never do that it's like a neurotic

2949.599 --> 2954.6400000000003
habit never to do that i always address

2952.24 --> 2957.52
everything no matter how stupid a troll

2954.64 --> 2959.68
you are if you're really stupid and it's

2957.52 --> 2961.7599999999998
really boring then i'll just get into

2959.68 --> 2963.5989999999997
your psychology and explain exactly

2961.76 --> 2966.6400000000003
what's going on and what you can expect

2963.599 --> 2968.48
to see in the future

2966.64 --> 2972.96
with a character like that

2968.48 --> 2975.839
yeah i always address everything i never

2972.96 --> 2978.96
hand wave dismiss even when everybody

2975.839 --> 2979.92
expects me to do that yeah every single

2978.96 --> 2981.92
time

2979.92 --> 2985.839
every single time

2981.92 --> 2985.839
every day every day

2994.16 --> 2999.52
ether is his substance wrong

2997.04 --> 3001.52
no the ether

2999.52 --> 3003.28
well there is ether which is actually a

3001.52 --> 3005.68
chemical

3003.28 --> 3009.599
and then there's the

3005.68 --> 3010.8799999999997
mythical medium for light

3009.599 --> 3013.2000000000003
the ether

3010.88 --> 3014.7200000000003
the light ether which is absolute

3013.2 --> 3017.68
mechanical fiction based on a

3014.72 --> 3020.319
misconception of the nature of light

3017.68 --> 3022.7999999999997
being waves it's ridiculous

3020.319 --> 3026.0
and then there's the electric ether

3022.8 --> 3028.88
which is what nikola tesla

3026.0 --> 3028.88
was dealing with

3035.52 --> 3040.559
it's not a substance

3037.76 --> 3042.4
it's basically an electric field that is

3040.559 --> 3044.96
ever present

3042.4 --> 3049.2400000000002
and that seems to correlate even with

3044.96 --> 3049.2400000000002
the celestial activity

3055.52 --> 3059.04
there's nothing mythical about it

3059.44 --> 3063.28
it's mysterious

3061.359 --> 3064.48
it's not mythical it's because it's

3063.28 --> 3066.48
there

3064.48 --> 3069.28
it's been established over the ages

3066.48 --> 3072.079
again and again like people rediscover

3069.28 --> 3072.079
that that's there

3073.359 --> 3078.88
right gravity is a mythical force

3077.04 --> 3082.7599999999998
well it's not even a force but you can

3078.88 --> 3082.76
think of it as a force

3082.96 --> 3087.079
it's quite mythical like that

3106.48 --> 3112.319
medium for transmission of

3108.359 --> 3112.319
electromagnetic wave interesting

3121.839 --> 3127.44
i need to inquire about that for a bit

3125.28 --> 3128.8
because my conception of the electric

3127.44 --> 3132.4
ether

3128.8 --> 3134.96
i didn't necessarily even connect that

3132.4 --> 3138.319
to what you're talking about i take that

3134.96 --> 3141.839
i take that the luminiferous ether is

3138.319 --> 3144.5589999999997
like enough an established concept

3141.839 --> 3146.7999999999997
i'm not sure if that is even

3144.559 --> 3146.8
it

3146.96 --> 3153.599
seems like a more specific

3149.119 --> 3155.6800000000003
medium again a medium assumption

3153.599 --> 3156.7200000000003
i'm just talking about energy that's in

3155.68 --> 3158.8799999999997
the air

3156.72 --> 3161.4399999999996
like it's there

3158.88 --> 3164.0
this is not about how the mechanics of

3161.44 --> 3166.559
electricity even work it's about the

3164.0 --> 3168.24
establishment that there is the energy

3166.559 --> 3171.28
there

3168.24 --> 3171.2799999999997
and it fluctuates

3176.64 --> 3181.24
if i put the white lab coat on oh

3182.64 --> 3186.7999999999997
well maybe i'll put on my crease ropes

3188.4 --> 3191.2000000000003
it's white too

3191.52 --> 3195.64
maybe yeah it's like oh

3196.8 --> 3204.52
why don't i do that you know

3200.319 --> 3204.52
maybe he'll believe me this way

3220.0 --> 3223.0
man

3233.28 --> 3238.2400000000002
i

3234.839 --> 3240.09
mean it's not a lab coat

3238.24 --> 3245.2799999999997
but it is white

3240.09 --> 3245.28
[Music]

3254.0 --> 3259.68
ah this thing looks much better on me

3256.24 --> 3259.68
now that i have a mustache

3262.4 --> 3268.44
make sure i have a pen in my pocket this

3264.4 --> 3268.44
thing doesn't have any pockets

3282.24 --> 3287.839
you then have to say this is an egg

3286.079 --> 3290.88
okay

3287.839 --> 3293.599
right i'm gonna run out the show

3290.88 --> 3295.839
i just impulsively wanted to show this

3293.599 --> 3298.559
like this is the closest i have to a lab

3295.839 --> 3298.5589999999997
coat i mean

3299.2 --> 3304.0789999999997
lab coat

3301.2 --> 3306.96
white priest rope

3304.079 --> 3308.0
with claims of intelligence and

3306.96 --> 3310.0
knowledge

3308.0 --> 3314.0
like beyond where people understand it

3310.0 --> 3314.0
it's not that big of a difference really

3315.2 --> 3318.799
right but this is my white wizard cloak

3317.76 --> 3322.079
indeed

3318.799 --> 3323.7599999999998
did you know that i actually went into

3322.079 --> 3327.119
like the mormon church wearing this

3323.76 --> 3330.88
thing once like with my with my staff by

3327.119 --> 3330.88
