quite different

110.72 --> 116.32
there was really a lot of

113.6 --> 120.88
blue sky and sun this morning although

116.32 --> 120.88
unfortunately there's just this cloud

121.2 --> 124.56
gone in front of the sun

126.88 --> 131.68
so yeah there's no

129.44 --> 135.52
brightness right now but it has been

131.68 --> 135.52
like that pretty much the entire morning

136.959 --> 143.84
quite a nice change

139.599 --> 143.83999999999997
compare compared to the last few days

145.76 --> 151.76
i also got this boost of energy from it

149.12 --> 151.76
this morning

151.92 --> 154.92
huh

159.76 --> 166.0
all right hello bill nye the science

166.0 --> 171.84
gadget inspector

168.48 --> 171.84

173.36 --> 178.87900000000002
the alert bell never wrong yeah it's

176.16 --> 181.519
it's unpredictable

178.879 --> 184.67999999999998
that's why i just say the time you know

181.519 --> 184.68
it's like

185.12 --> 190.0
hopefully the bell will help you out but

188.8 --> 192.56
in the end

190.0 --> 194.8
yeah i i just checked the channel at the

192.56 --> 194.8
time

195.519 --> 198.519
uh

198.56 --> 203.68
got snow in france oh really

201.44 --> 203.68

222.08 --> 229.76000000000002
i had some

224.48 --> 229.76
like weather reports about storm irwin

235.36 --> 240.799

240.799 --> 245.0
of november 2021.

251.04 --> 255.12
not where i live it was known

253.519 --> 257.199
okay

255.12 --> 261.72
sure

257.199 --> 261.72
uh hey bex good to see you

270.479 --> 275.36
right

272.08 --> 278.08
so yeah yesterday for me was kind of a

275.36 --> 282.199
bit of a quiet day

278.08 --> 282.19899999999996
weren't a lot of like streams

288.0 --> 291.68
i even thought that like the flattered

290.0 --> 293.12
debates were kind of shorter than i

291.68 --> 296.479
thought it would be

293.12 --> 298.88
but yeah

296.479 --> 301.44
it was good

298.88 --> 305.039
seeing that back

301.44 --> 305.039
still very ball when ish

307.039 --> 310.039
uh

311.36 --> 315.199
yeah gerund at some more

313.919 --> 318.52
clips

315.199 --> 318.52000000000004
good stuff

343.759 --> 346.759
hmm

353.199 --> 356.88
then the war between jiren and jake

355.36 --> 359.68
started

356.88 --> 359.68
didn't really

362.479 --> 368.56
i don't know i haven't seen like actual

365.039 --> 368.56
current day live streams

370.4 --> 373.59999999999997
from jiren about that

374.08 --> 379.08
but maybe that's all like on rockfin and

376.08 --> 379.08
stuff

380.319 --> 384.47900000000004
hey elise g good to see you

385.28 --> 388.79999999999995
it's gone crazy okay

389.12 --> 393.759
well i just remember that

391.199 --> 395.759
jaren did address jake like even a long

393.759 --> 399.28000000000003
time ago

395.759 --> 399.28000000000003
that's where that clip came from

402.08 --> 406.44
but is it really worth it

411.599 --> 416.8
i mean that this is just like the time

414.08 --> 418.479
when ips was getting all rowdy that's

416.8 --> 420.24
also really time

418.479 --> 421.68
that i got to pick up on jake the

420.24 --> 423.199
[ __ ]

421.68 --> 425.199
and

423.199 --> 426.72
they were all just like oh screw it

425.199 --> 429.599
we're just gonna

426.72 --> 432.72
do whatever we want you can't stop us

429.599 --> 436.24
type of attitude ips

432.72 --> 438.319
and with jake and with some others and

436.24 --> 440.88
and they constantly just go after

438.319 --> 442.319
everybody

440.88 --> 445.039
but it's a waste of time because you

442.319 --> 446.96000000000004
can't really you can't really attack

445.039 --> 448.96
these guys

446.96 --> 450.71999999999997
because they're just openly shameless

448.96 --> 453.52
bastards

450.72 --> 453.52000000000004
it's no point

453.759 --> 458.12
like if you don't pick up on that

476.24 --> 479.84000000000003
hello the v man

480.76 --> 483.88
[Music]

490.319 --> 494.72
both sides are wrong what

497.039 --> 500.44
what do you mean

508.879 --> 514.919
your opinion that's

511.039 --> 514.919
that doesn't really help

527.12 --> 531.839
like wrong about what that there are

529.279 --> 533.68
arguments

531.839 --> 535.839
there are analysis of each other like

533.68 --> 535.8389999999999
what

536.16 --> 543.8389999999999
they wrong to engage

540.16 --> 543.8389999999999
i'd agree with that part but

544.08 --> 547.88
like what do you mean

553.839 --> 556.839
um

576.56 --> 581.279
a quantum unconscious had a very curious

578.88 --> 581.279
video

581.68 --> 585.3599999999999
on this free voice website

585.6 --> 589.9200000000001
anybody see that

587.6 --> 593.12
like he went completely overkill

589.92 --> 595.36
conspiracy conspiracy theories

593.12 --> 597.2
conspiracy theories he like let himself

595.36 --> 599.839
go in like oh

597.2 --> 602.0790000000001
look he's just seeing twin towers in

599.839 --> 605.2
literally everything

602.079 --> 607.279
and it was really overkill

605.2 --> 610.6400000000001
but he also pointed out a couple of

607.279 --> 613.279
interesting little details in

610.64 --> 614.8
in the very old movie he was reviewing

613.279 --> 618.04
in that

614.8 --> 618.04
i don't know

619.92 --> 624.16
and like it was an old movie black and

621.92 --> 624.16
white

624.72 --> 630.0790000000001
which he thinks is like a

627.36 --> 633.0790000000001
predictor of the 911

630.079 --> 633.079
situation

633.36 --> 636.24
it was interesting

637.519 --> 640.519
uh

664.56 --> 667.1199999999999
right so what do you guys thought about

666.32 --> 670.0790000000001
my

667.12 --> 672.64
mom my elaborate back and forth with

670.079 --> 674.88
professor phil bell yesterday

672.64 --> 678.8
on my uh here

674.88 --> 678.8
like what did you guys think about that

685.519 --> 691.44
i mean was it a waste of time

689.6 --> 694.72
did

691.44 --> 697.2790000000001
did i achieve anything

694.72 --> 699.9200000000001
i just tried to elaborate on a lot of

697.279 --> 703.519
details of his background

699.92 --> 705.92
from kind of a neutral perspective

703.519 --> 708.72
to really figure out like oh it's

705.92 --> 711.04
supposedly a professor so what exactly

708.72 --> 713.0400000000001
does he do to make him that

711.04 --> 715.4399999999999
to make him think about it too right you

713.04 --> 717.4399999999999
have to be neutral not just like oh i'm

715.44 --> 719.6800000000001
gonna get him i'm gonna get him oh i'm

717.44 --> 720.8000000000001
gonna catch him

719.68 --> 722.959
but just

720.8 --> 727.4799999999999
like really try to

722.959 --> 727.4799999999999
get real information out of it

732.0 --> 735.04
he is the best

736.48 --> 741.76
hello good servant

739.12 --> 741.76
he is the

743.44 --> 745.839
who

747.279 --> 751.04
you mean quantum of conscious

752.24 --> 758.6800000000001
good servant

754.32 --> 758.6800000000001
i mean he is all about that

764.399 --> 768.48
yeah there was even a baller calling in

766.16 --> 770.959
that yeah gadget inspector yeah

768.48 --> 773.76
well those kinds of hilarious situations

770.959 --> 776.3199999999999
do kind of happen here

773.76 --> 776.3199999999999
don't they

781.839 --> 787.72
and i do really appreciate that about my

784.72 --> 787.72
show

788.0 --> 792.8
because it's not just oh it's all about

790.399 --> 794.88
the fronts of the flat earth versus the

792.8 --> 797.04
front of the ballers

794.88 --> 797.04
no

798.16 --> 802.3199999999999
i mean that is an issue but it's not

801.12 --> 804.5600000000001
it's not what

802.32 --> 807.279
what's being focused on so you do get to

804.56 --> 808.16
see that yeah flat earthers have a lot

807.279 --> 810.399
of

808.16 --> 812.959
different opinions about things and can

810.399 --> 814.56
get into arguments about other subjects

812.959 --> 816.959
other details

814.56 --> 819.279
but so can ballers

816.959 --> 821.199
and it's not like they all

819.279 --> 823.519
find each other all that trustworthy

821.199 --> 823.519
either

824.88 --> 831.12
right

826.8 --> 831.12
if he is a professor i will eat my hand

835.68 --> 840.079
well apparently there nobody eventually

838.32 --> 843.1990000000001
even linked me up

840.079 --> 844.959
but apparently there is on video

843.199 --> 848.079
well basically a video where he is

844.959 --> 848.079
giving a class so

851.36 --> 856.839
so i've heard from you guys in chat

857.199 --> 861.4799999999999
i haven't actually seen it yet

870.639 --> 875.6
frank was his name seemed to know

873.44 --> 878.9200000000001
right well i don't really know who he

875.6 --> 878.9200000000001
was but

904.399 --> 910.279
dude if you're gonna troll me at least

906.639 --> 910.279
spell it right

921.04 --> 924.8
a professor wouldn't talk to or have

922.959 --> 926.88
anything to do with trolls i don't know

924.8 --> 930.199
about that jeff gas head i don't know

926.88 --> 930.199
about that

945.519 --> 949.759
like just because you're

947.279 --> 952.88
teaching at some place doesn't make you

949.759 --> 955.519
impervious for bad

952.88 --> 957.4399999999999
character judgment and

955.519 --> 960.88
doesn't automatically mean you have a

957.44 --> 963.12
very high standard social life okay

960.88 --> 963.12
so

964.959 --> 968.8389999999999
i disagree with that

975.759 --> 981.759
but they say he controls satellites

979.759 --> 982.88
you're not buying that

981.759 --> 984.16
gadget

982.88 --> 986.56
why not

984.16 --> 986.56
i mean

986.72 --> 992.5600000000001
if a guy just says he controls

989.04 --> 995.5999999999999
satellites in orbit right

992.56 --> 999.5999999999999
him just saying that should be enough

995.6 --> 999.6
proof for you to believe that i mean

999.759 --> 1003.6800000000001
that's like normal right it's like oh

1001.839 --> 1006.5600000000001
yeah i have a car

1003.68 --> 1008.7199999999999
you're not gonna be like oh my god

1006.56 --> 1010.8
show me that car

1008.72 --> 1012.8000000000001
you know because like who doesn't have a

1010.8 --> 1014.8
car it's not that weird and there's so

1012.8 --> 1016.7199999999999
many satellites out there so if you just

1014.8 --> 1019.68
say like dude because satellites are

1016.72 --> 1022.1600000000001
real i can control them

1019.68 --> 1024.8799999999999
not demonstrate how he does that but

1022.16 --> 1026.799
just say like yeah i can that's like why

1024.88 --> 1028.72
would you question that

1026.799 --> 1030.48
i mean it's satellites there's so many

1028.72 --> 1032.959
of them

1030.48 --> 1035.28
supposedly

1032.959 --> 1037.28
why would you

1035.28 --> 1039.839
draw doubt when somebody makes a

1037.28 --> 1041.839
statement like i control satellites in

1039.839 --> 1043.6789999999999
orbit

1041.839 --> 1046.6399999999999
that's like should be the normalest

1043.679 --> 1046.64
thing in the world

1047.6 --> 1050.6
right

1057.28 --> 1062.48
yeah i'm actually being sarcastic i hope

1060.0 --> 1066.28
people realize that

1062.48 --> 1066.28
otherwise you've got a problem

1069.76 --> 1072.559
right oh yeah

1074.64 --> 1082.16
i got inspired yesterday bake to uh make

1078.48 --> 1082.16
or rather modify a meme

1083.6 --> 1088.6789999999999
it's been kind of in the weight for a

1085.36 --> 1088.6789999999999
long time

1097.36 --> 1100.6789999999999
ah man

1116.24 --> 1119.24
hey

1125.52 --> 1129.28
oh man

1127.36 --> 1131.28
i'm getting sniffy all of a sudden ah

1129.28 --> 1134.28
look sun is coming out again look at

1131.28 --> 1134.28
that

1136.88 --> 1140.72
see now that's what i'm talking about

1140.88 --> 1143.3600000000001
beautiful

1143.76 --> 1149.24
and it's so wind still it's like really

1146.24 --> 1149.24
remarkable

1156.72 --> 1160.2
don't go away

1165.76 --> 1170.799
ah bit sniffy

1168.08 --> 1170.799
we'll be all right

1171.679 --> 1176.48
i don't have a car but i have many

1173.84 --> 1180.84
satellites

1176.48 --> 1180.84
right good servant you get the jokes

1198.32 --> 1204.6789999999999
a real professor would not lie and troll

1200.64 --> 1204.679
fe channels well

1209.52 --> 1214.08
unless they were really into ball earth

1214.72 --> 1217.84
i mean

1216.0 --> 1219.76
if you engage in that sort of thing

1217.84 --> 1222.3999999999999
you're not gonna get like a lot of

1219.76 --> 1224.559
respect from higher ups

1222.4 --> 1226.0800000000002
because they kind of

1224.559 --> 1228.08
explicitly

1226.08 --> 1230.559
warn you

1228.08 --> 1234.48
pretty sure they do

1230.559 --> 1237.44
like don't engage with that

1234.48 --> 1237.44
like don't do that

1240.159 --> 1244.24
like you don't get recommended like oh

1242.32 --> 1246.72
make all these counter arguments why

1244.24 --> 1248.4
flat earthers are wrong no they just say

1246.72 --> 1250.08
don't engage with that

1248.4 --> 1252.4
like it's a trick

1250.08 --> 1255.039
so if he's falling for that that means

1252.4 --> 1255.039
like okay

1256.88 --> 1259.0390000000002
like

1260.559 --> 1265.28
yeah that basically

1262.799 --> 1267.9189999999999
halts him

1265.28 --> 1272.3999999999999
in any virtual progress he could have

1267.919 --> 1272.4
gotten like career-wise connection-wise

1273.28 --> 1278.3999999999999
or maybe or maybe when that happens and

1276.32 --> 1279.76
you do go for it you get like another

1278.4 --> 1282.4
designation

1279.76 --> 1284.48
in this in the system and like okay

1282.4 --> 1286.64
that person just goes after the flat

1284.48 --> 1288.72
earthers

1286.64 --> 1290.7990000000002
make sure he keeps it up but don't

1288.72 --> 1294.88
really involve them anymore because

1290.799 --> 1294.8799999999999
basically they go completely nuts

1295.2 --> 1298.88
just kind of plain for all to see

1300.4 --> 1306.0
hey frank drebin

1303.52 --> 1308.72
right anyway memes

1306.0 --> 1308.72
remember the

1309.679 --> 1314.88
the meme that i bumped into thanks to

1311.679 --> 1318.24
paul joseph watson

1314.88 --> 1322.4
about the hamburgers

1318.24 --> 1322.4
right the advertisement for hamburgers

1324.559 --> 1331.6
and yeah it's like

1327.76 --> 1334.0
gay men kissing and then

1331.6 --> 1336.559
like the product or like the

1334.0 --> 1338.64
other person that the meetings with is

1336.559 --> 1341.52
asking like are you sure this is gonna

1338.64 --> 1343.1200000000001
sell more hamburgers

1341.52 --> 1346.12
and the guy with the idea is like

1343.12 --> 1346.12
hamburgers

1346.799 --> 1349.76
because he's actually trying to sell the

1348.799 --> 1351.039
gay

1349.76 --> 1353.36
right

1351.039 --> 1354.96
that meme

1353.36 --> 1357.28
i think is quite

1354.96 --> 1359.679
well known by now i made a modification

1357.28 --> 1362.799
of that

1359.679 --> 1362.799
flat earth style

1364.48 --> 1369.039
might not be as

1365.919 --> 1372.24
widespread gripping as the original

1369.039 --> 1374.72
which is like widely adaptable

1372.24 --> 1377.72
but i still think it's funny so here it

1374.72 --> 1377.72
goes

1390.48 --> 1395.2
right let me read it out for those that

1392.799 --> 1397.679
aren't looking right now

1395.2 --> 1399.8400000000001
behold our latest strategy against those

1397.679 --> 1402.0
pesky flat earthers

1399.84 --> 1404.9599999999998
then you see arguments on a piece of

1402.0 --> 1406.88
paper the horizon isn't geometric

1404.96 --> 1408.64
we don't expect to see coriolis

1406.88 --> 1410.96
deviation

1408.64 --> 1413.1200000000001
then the other guy is like are you sure

1410.96 --> 1414.4
this is going to help us prove the ball

1413.12 --> 1417.84
earth

1414.4 --> 1417.8400000000001
ball earth

1420.88 --> 1424.64
is that a gym bombing i don't know i

1423.36 --> 1427.279
i'm not sure

1424.64 --> 1430.679
i don't think so

1427.279 --> 1430.679
it could be

1432.4 --> 1437.52
but probably not

1435.279 --> 1440.08
but maybe it is i don't know if is this

1437.52 --> 1440.08
his meme

1443.039 --> 1446.799
i just

1444.88 --> 1450.0
bumped into it i didn't really trace it

1446.799 --> 1450.0
back to a source so

1450.88 --> 1455.0
anyway tell me what you think

1480.159 --> 1485.679
i should be in advertising oh yes

1484.48 --> 1488.96
oh

1485.679 --> 1488.96
what a great idea

1489.279 --> 1495.52
it's not just diametrically opposed to

1492.24 --> 1495.52
everything i stand for

1496.799 --> 1502.559
but by the way

1498.4 --> 1502.5590000000002
it doesn't necessarily have to be

1510.32 --> 1515.039
nah it's just a meme it's like me

1512.96 --> 1517.919
modification i don't even freaking make

1515.039 --> 1517.919
these myself

1519.039 --> 1524.4
but when i see this kind of stuff

1522.159 --> 1525.679
that's when i get like

1524.4 --> 1528.4
like these

1525.679 --> 1529.679
well fractal insights and then i like

1528.4 --> 1531.8400000000001
yeah

1529.679 --> 1534.24
this situation applies to a whole bunch

1531.84 --> 1536.48
of things guess what it also applies

1534.24 --> 1539.36
structurally

1536.48 --> 1541.6
to an entire field

1539.36 --> 1544.32
in the same way

1541.6 --> 1545.9189999999999
with a slightly different angle but it

1544.32 --> 1548.8799999999999
is the same

1545.919 --> 1552.3600000000001
and that's what i do that is

1548.88 --> 1552.3600000000001
what i do

1559.76 --> 1563.76
so yeah i thought that was very

1561.279 --> 1565.919
appropriate

1563.76 --> 1567.919
right it's technically not even the same

1565.919 --> 1571.8400000000001
joke

1567.919 --> 1571.8400000000001
but it is the same pattern

1572.559 --> 1579.36
so i hope you guys appreciate that meme

1575.2 --> 1579.3600000000001
i've been spamming it all over like

1579.52 --> 1584.1589999999999
skype and

1580.72 --> 1585.84
even in discord

1584.159 --> 1588.96
but then again it was sunday and

1585.84 --> 1591.6
everybody was just kind of like not

1588.96 --> 1593.679
all there with their attention

1591.6 --> 1597.9599999999998
i thought it would get more

1593.679 --> 1597.96
responses but anyway

1606.96 --> 1609.96
man

1616.24 --> 1619.24
so

1628.559 --> 1633.52
the space job he claims is also fake oh

1634.32 --> 1637.32
wow

1640.64 --> 1645.76
well frank drabin

1643.2 --> 1650.64
if that's really true

1645.76 --> 1650.64
i would kind of appreciate it if ballers

1650.88 --> 1656.96
would actually expose him but like make

1653.76 --> 1659.44
work of it actually prove like okay

1656.96 --> 1661.76
we all like the ball we believe it's a

1659.44 --> 1663.8400000000001
possibility and no it's complicated

1661.76 --> 1666.48
whatever you know your belief

1663.84 --> 1670.6399999999999
but like this guy is just a liar and a

1666.48 --> 1672.88
faker and i am going to prove it

1670.64 --> 1674.3200000000002
i mean doing that as a flat earther is

1672.88 --> 1676.48
kind of tough

1674.32 --> 1678.0
if you are a baller and you're like

1676.48 --> 1680.0
connected

1678.0 --> 1681.12
it would probably be in the best

1680.0 --> 1683.52
interest of

1681.12 --> 1684.399
well the honor

1683.52 --> 1687.44
of

1684.399 --> 1689.12
your position within this philosophical

1687.44 --> 1691.6000000000001
debacle

1689.12 --> 1695.039
to basically expose people that are just

1691.6 --> 1697.84
overt liars that even lie about

1695.039 --> 1697.84
what they've done

1698.64 --> 1704.72
in their attempts to promote

1702.159 --> 1707.5200000000002
their authority in the field

1704.72 --> 1710.88
right i think it would be in your best

1707.52 --> 1713.44
interest as ballers to expose people

1710.88 --> 1715.919
that are just faking that [ __ ]

1713.44 --> 1717.919
because do you really want to have

1715.919 --> 1720.5590000000002
people like that represent your side of

1717.919 --> 1720.5590000000002
the argument

1720.799 --> 1726.559
when they're like provable liars

1724.24 --> 1728.3990000000001
you know

1726.559 --> 1731.6789999999999
i know isn't it weird

1728.399 --> 1735.279
i'm actually defending the ball again

1731.679 --> 1735.279
or at least the community of it

1735.36 --> 1741.52
yeah if you can call that a community

1737.2 --> 1741.52
because it's not all just trolls okay

1746.799 --> 1750.32
right frank robin well

1749.039 --> 1752.96
all right

1750.32 --> 1756.6399999999999
you could make work of it if you think

1752.96 --> 1758.32
you have like a lead

1756.64 --> 1761.279
animal data

1758.32 --> 1763.6
about professor phil bell that proves

1761.279 --> 1767.84
that he is a liar

1763.6 --> 1767.84
then make a little video about it

1774.64 --> 1781.159
see if you can actually put a video

1776.64 --> 1781.159
together where you make your case

1825.919 --> 1829.96
anyway here's the meme again

1836.399 --> 1840.0
how how does it apply

1842.399 --> 1846.4799999999998
like you could literally just paste

1846.72 --> 1852.48
like faces

1849.44 --> 1855.44
you could like paste the face a rumpus

1852.48 --> 1859.919
over the guy with the with the blue with

1855.44 --> 1862.159
the blue sweater and the orange tie or

1859.919 --> 1863.679
one of the other guys your net nuke or

1862.159 --> 1865.279
whoever you want

1863.679 --> 1868.3200000000002
and it would be

1865.279 --> 1870.24
pretty accurate

1868.32 --> 1872.96
i mean they probably wouldn't say like

1870.24 --> 1875.279
ball earth but that is basically what

1872.96 --> 1877.3600000000001
they do they probably realize it and

1875.279 --> 1880.159
then make up a whole bunch of excuses to

1877.36 --> 1880.1589999999999
get away from it

1881.679 --> 1885.88
but it does work out anyway

1893.919 --> 1898.3990000000001
would need a journalist to dig deeper

1905.44 --> 1908.799
right

1906.559 --> 1908.799
well

1910.159 --> 1912.48
yeah

1912.64 --> 1915.279
maybe that's

1915.36 --> 1920.799
yeah maybe you know some journalists

1917.44 --> 1922.24
like do you know often like journalists

1920.799 --> 1924.08
that are like in the middle of their

1922.24 --> 1928.0
study

1924.08 --> 1928.0
are really good for that sort of like

1928.08 --> 1930.519
thing

1928.88 --> 1933.44
right because they're not like all

1930.519 --> 1935.679
encapsulated by some contractual

1933.44 --> 1938.799
interest or whatever

1935.679 --> 1941.6000000000001
and not even bound by a lot of rules yet

1938.799 --> 1944.399
so a lot of like journalist

1941.6 --> 1948.12
students are very suitable for doing

1944.399 --> 1948.12
that sort of uh

1949.6 --> 1952.08
research

1958.24 --> 1962.88
or maybe you had just happened to know

1960.48 --> 1964.88
people

1962.88 --> 1967.6000000000001
that might be interested in doing

1964.88 --> 1967.6000000000001
something like that

1968.96 --> 1973.279
i don't know anybody but maybe you

1974.84 --> 1981.4399999999998
do phil bill his real name well look

1978.399 --> 1984.2399999999998
gadget inspector

1981.44 --> 1987.519
maybe it is maybe it's different right

1984.24 --> 1988.64
that can also be figured out i mean he

1987.519 --> 1992.72
has been

1988.64 --> 1996.96
on camera plenty of times with his face

1992.72 --> 1999.6000000000001
so there is a very solid identifier

1996.96 --> 2002.48
now it could be that it's just all a

1999.6 --> 2005.799
giant cover [ __ ] story i don't know

2002.48 --> 2005.799
if it is

2006.48 --> 2011.279
then he would be like a very serious

2010.159 --> 2013.519
weirdo

2011.279 --> 2013.519
but

2013.84 --> 2019.0
right

2014.64 --> 2019.0
you can figure all those things out

2024.72 --> 2031.48
they would imprison jordan what the hell

2027.2 --> 2031.48
no jeff gassett that's ridiculous

2033.12 --> 2037.4399999999998
like people that are actually in deep

2035.679 --> 2040.159
cover

2037.44 --> 2043.3600000000001
pretending to be all these things and

2040.159 --> 2043.3600000000001
lying about it and then

2043.919 --> 2047.8400000000001
getting online trying to get in people's

2046.159 --> 2050.2400000000002
fit they don't really have that much

2047.84 --> 2051.919
power look because it's all lies like

2050.24 --> 2053.5989999999997
what are they gonna do

2051.919 --> 2056.56
nothing

2053.599 --> 2057.599
it means they're not actually connected

2056.56 --> 2061.52
right

2057.599 --> 2063.28
now if he turns out not to be lying

2061.52 --> 2065.28
then well you could just give an honest

2063.28 --> 2067.28
report like okay i thought it was fake

2065.28 --> 2069.44
but look i did some research it turns

2067.28 --> 2071.52
out that he actually is this and that

2069.44 --> 2073.359
and that

2071.52 --> 2076.24
and what is he going to do come after

2073.359 --> 2076.24
you for just

2077.119 --> 2081.9190000000003
basically confirming with his part of

2079.52 --> 2082.639
his claims i don't think so

2081.919 --> 2087.399
so

2082.639 --> 2087.3990000000003
he's not gonna come after you for that

2099.76 --> 2104.2400000000002
who knows maybe he would try to do the

2102.079 --> 2106.8
same thing to you or something

2104.24 --> 2108.8799999999997
i get you all investigated i don't know

2106.8 --> 2113.4
what he would do but he's not you're not

2108.88 --> 2113.4
gonna get into real trouble for that

2123.119 --> 2126.7200000000003
and like how are you going to imprison a

2124.96 --> 2128.0
journalist for

2126.72 --> 2131.04
like

2128.0 --> 2132.8
uncovering a grifter

2131.04 --> 2134.48
so i think it would probably be

2132.8 --> 2137.88
classified

2134.48 --> 2137.88
like no

2146.32 --> 2151.04
so is there no way

2148.32 --> 2153.92
for globals to measure an r value when

2151.04 --> 2158.68
they say the horizon is refracted

2153.92 --> 2158.6800000000003
well you can't optically measure it

2160.079 --> 2167.44
let's get into ballwin mode for a second

2163.92 --> 2171.2000000000003
you can still derive the r value

2167.44 --> 2176.0
from transverse distance

2171.2 --> 2178.0
and then yeah you have to presuppose

2176.0 --> 2180.24
you have to presuppose the orientation

2178.0 --> 2182.48
basically

2180.24 --> 2184.64
but with terrestrial refraction

2182.48 --> 2187.44
optically measuring

2184.64 --> 2190.44
geometry of the earth is

2187.44 --> 2190.44
pointless

2202.32 --> 2207.04
never know what they would do with us no

2208.079 --> 2212.5600000000004
like

2209.839 --> 2214.48
are you saying that professor phil is in

2212.56 --> 2218.64
australia like i don't think he's

2214.48 --> 2218.64
australian at all gadget inspector

2223.04 --> 2226.52
or is he

2237.04 --> 2243.32
i thought he was like american

2239.52 --> 2243.32
but maybe i'm wrong

2247.68 --> 2251.2
he has an aussie accent

2255.119 --> 2257.76
okay

2256.4 --> 2259.52
all right

2257.76 --> 2261.5200000000004
well still it doesn't really matter that

2259.52 --> 2265.079
much

2261.52 --> 2265.079
like no

2294.16 --> 2298.64
right also

2295.599 --> 2301.3590000000004
saying never you would never know what

2298.64 --> 2302.96
they would do in australia these days

2301.359 --> 2305.68
because it's going to hell no that's

2302.96 --> 2307.599
entirely wrong assessment

2305.68 --> 2310.3199999999997
no you know exactly what they're going

2307.599 --> 2311.76
to do because it is going to hell

2310.32 --> 2313.92
right you know

2311.76 --> 2315.3590000000004
how they operate like what are they

2313.92 --> 2318.48
gonna

2315.359 --> 2319.68
step over the normal civil boundaries

2318.48 --> 2321.92
for

2319.68 --> 2323.839
they're not gonna do that for when you

2321.92 --> 2325.44
expose a grifter

2323.839 --> 2327.2
they're gonna do it for when you

2325.44 --> 2330.56
criticize their

2327.2 --> 2330.56
hostile policies

2331.04 --> 2335.92
right the sea related policies

2334.32 --> 2337.52
if you're gonna criticize that as a

2335.92 --> 2339.119
journalist oh yeah they're gonna come

2337.52 --> 2340.4
after they're not

2339.119 --> 2343.28
they

2340.4 --> 2345.44
why the hell would anybody in the

2343.28 --> 2347.44
australian government give just the

2345.44 --> 2349.839
slightest of shits or even the police

2347.44 --> 2351.359
why would they give a [ __ ] about some

2349.839 --> 2353.119
clown

2351.359 --> 2355.7599999999998
pretending to be

2353.119 --> 2359.28
a satellite operator

2355.76 --> 2361.44
and fake like why would they give a [ __ ]

2359.28 --> 2364.1600000000003
think about it

2361.44 --> 2365.92
don't blurt [ __ ] out

2364.16 --> 2367.2
think about it

2365.92 --> 2372.64
don't

2367.2 --> 2372.64
make me do it every time you realize it

2379.04 --> 2383.0
hey slow mo moon buggy

2403.28 --> 2407.44
ah summer moon buggy i'm going to keep

2405.04 --> 2408.56
on showing this thing because people

2407.44 --> 2410.7200000000003
get in

2408.56 --> 2412.56
like five minutes before i round out the

2410.72 --> 2414.48
shows sometimes and then they miss

2412.56 --> 2416.4
everything

2414.48 --> 2419.28
so i'm just gonna keep showing my meme

2416.4 --> 2421.839
that i made yesterday

2419.28 --> 2424.0
i'm gonna get very spammy because i want

2421.839 --> 2427.599
everybody to see this i'm not gonna let

2424.0 --> 2427.599
you slip past this [ __ ]

2437.04 --> 2442.48
uh okay mike said the niche thanks so he

2439.359 --> 2443.2799999999997
was in australia all right makes sense i

2442.48 --> 2445.92
guess

2443.28 --> 2450.599
i didn't realize i haven't really heard

2445.92 --> 2450.599
professor phil bell's voice a lot

2456.64 --> 2461.72
all right so you got that slow mo moon

2458.72 --> 2461.72
buggy

2499.68 --> 2505.04
i can't read it on my phone

2502.319 --> 2505.04
ah damn it

2505.76 --> 2508.76
uh

2510.079 --> 2512.8
too small

2514.88 --> 2520.319
all right i'll just

2517.52 --> 2520.319
read it out

2520.64 --> 2525.2
right so it's based this is not an

2522.48 --> 2527.599
original meme i basically modified it it

2525.2 --> 2529.4399999999996
says the first picture behold our latest

2527.599 --> 2531.52
strategy against those pesky flat

2529.44 --> 2533.119
earthers and the second one that's

2531.52 --> 2535.52
what's on the paper

2533.119 --> 2538.4
the horizon isn't geometric we don't

2535.52 --> 2539.52
expect to see coriolis deviation

2538.4 --> 2541.839
then

2539.52 --> 2544.0
the next one

2541.839 --> 2547.04
second guy is like are you sure this is

2544.0 --> 2550.599
going to help us prove the ball earth

2547.04 --> 2550.599
ball earth

2556.0 --> 2559.56
so that's it

2570.319 --> 2574.319
that's good yeah i thought so

2574.8 --> 2580.6400000000003
very appropriate

2577.52 --> 2580.64
just the way i like it

2588.96 --> 2591.2
right

2591.599 --> 2596.1600000000003
feel free to spread it around

2594.0 --> 2597.599
the problem is i can't just

2596.16 --> 2599.359
like

2597.599 --> 2600.88
share the image

2599.359 --> 2603.359
like i could dump it somewhere on

2600.88 --> 2604.839
discord i think i'd

2603.359 --> 2608.48
i think i dumped

2604.839 --> 2608.48
it in the

2608.8 --> 2612.8
in the text

2611.04 --> 2613.92
room from

2612.8 --> 2616.4
fed

2613.92 --> 2619.28
from the fed room

2616.4 --> 2623.44
i put it in there

2619.28 --> 2623.44
that's probably spammed away by now

2629.839 --> 2634.7599999999998
i'll i'll put it in there if you're

2631.76 --> 2634.76
interested

2636.72 --> 2641.56
because it is definitely up for copying

2657.44 --> 2661.839
right so

2658.96 --> 2663.119
this is on the flat earth debate

2661.839 --> 2665.52
science

2663.119 --> 2665.52
channel

2666.0 --> 2670.079
live stream nathan oakley main chat

2672.079 --> 2677.6800000000003
that's where you can find it

2673.92 --> 2680.48
anyway let's get back

2677.68 --> 2680.48
to my show

2683.92 --> 2689.359
you should make more if them

2687.119 --> 2689.359
now

2689.68 --> 2693.7599999999998
now i've had my periods when i tried to

2692.319 --> 2697.72
do that but

2693.76 --> 2697.7200000000003
it's just by happenstance

2708.64 --> 2710.96
what

2712.96 --> 2719.839
your cracked phone screen had blocked

2715.68 --> 2719.839
60 people that's insane

2720.88 --> 2725.119
wow talk about pocket banning that's

2726.48 --> 2730.2
how did that happen

2744.72 --> 2749.1189999999997
but yeah gadget inspector look it

2747.119 --> 2750.96
if there's some meme going around

2749.119 --> 2754.6400000000003
there's a good chance i'll figure out

2750.96 --> 2754.64
some kind of modification of it

2754.8 --> 2762.319
it's it's just what i did with the uh

2758.64 --> 2765.2
the npc meme remember all that when that

2762.319 --> 2765.2
was all the [ __ ]

2768.56 --> 2772.24
it was really basic

2770.319 --> 2773.68
but yeah i made a couple of those as

2772.24 --> 2776.64
well i'll show them they're still like

2773.68 --> 2776.64
on my desktop

2777.119 --> 2782.6400000000003
that was like a whole thing

2779.92 --> 2784.8
what is it now two years ago

2782.64 --> 2788.48
right

2784.8 --> 2791.2000000000003
perhaps there is no proof of r

2788.48 --> 2791.2
r is proven

2795.359 --> 2800.48
perhaps flat earthers are not so stupid

2797.52 --> 2802.4
flat earth is dumb

2800.48 --> 2805.359
downward acceleration force can be

2802.4 --> 2809.359
widely deduced to exist

2805.359 --> 2809.359
there is only density and buoyancy

2812.96 --> 2817.319
it's extra funny now that meaning

2818.16 --> 2826.2799999999997
i love my p900 it's a great camera i

2821.2 --> 2826.2799999999997
must have a p1000 it is better

2854.559 --> 2859.559
got a new one all right lg good

2870.0 --> 2872.88
they're good

2871.04 --> 2875.04
decent

2872.88 --> 2878.88
like at the time they were great but

2875.04 --> 2880.88
look everybody out there was using memes

2878.88 --> 2883.6800000000003
was using the memes there must have been

2880.88 --> 2887.2000000000003
like a hundred million variants

2883.68 --> 2890.2
of those out there and i gave it a go

2887.2 --> 2890.2
too

2901.119 --> 2906.079
why couldn't they make made the phones

2903.359 --> 2908.0789999999997
with bulletproof glass

2906.079 --> 2911.52
well because service day this is what i

2908.079 --> 2913.52
suspect it's conspiracy theory

2911.52 --> 2915.2
they make it

2913.52 --> 2916.48
so that it breaks

2915.2 --> 2919.4399999999996
you know why

2916.48 --> 2922.0
because they want you

2919.44 --> 2924.559
to give them the phone

2922.0 --> 2926.4
so they can get your metadata that it

2924.559 --> 2929.6800000000003
has collected and then they give you a

2926.4 --> 2931.52
new one a fresh new one oh it's all new

2929.68 --> 2934.0789999999997
right it's really easy you just get the

2931.52 --> 2935.68
new one and they take everything you've

2934.079 --> 2938.48
done that's like

2935.68 --> 2938.48
on that phone

2940.72 --> 2946.24
not even talking about literally data

2942.8 --> 2947.76
caches of like photo library but other

2946.24 --> 2950.16
metadata

2947.76 --> 2953.28
and they take it and they use it to

2950.16 --> 2953.2799999999997
model things out

2954.24 --> 2960.3999999999996
and that's why i think they kind of like

2958.4 --> 2962.7200000000003
have all this breakable glass because

2960.4 --> 2963.839
like the phone is gonna keep working you

2962.72 --> 2966.319
know

2963.839 --> 2968.48
but when the glass break it's [ __ ] so

2966.319 --> 2969.92
it's like it's ultimate weakness why

2968.48 --> 2972.4
would they keep the weakness well

2969.92 --> 2974.64
because they want you to get a new one

2972.4 --> 2977.359
so they you give them your old one then

2974.64 --> 2980.7999999999997
they get the metadata

2977.359 --> 2980.7999999999997
that's what i think is going on

2981.359 --> 2986.16
because it is completely pointless that

2983.68 --> 2989.2
that glass is so breakable it should be

2986.16 --> 2991.2799999999997
absolutely unscratchable unbreakable

2989.2 --> 2993.4399999999996
like you should it should be so strong

2991.28 --> 2994.96
you should be able to like bash the

2993.44 --> 2997.28
phone with a hammer

2994.96 --> 2999.44
have all the electronics all the plastic

2997.28 --> 3002.6400000000003
completely crushed and the glass would

2999.44 --> 3004.64
be unscratched and perfectly whole that

3002.64 --> 3009.4
should be the case

3004.64 --> 3009.4
but it isn't this is quite the opposite

3026.4 --> 3030.319
i just a new phone why

3029.359 --> 3032.64
why

3030.319 --> 3032.64
guys

3032.72 --> 3037.2799999999997
can you please just

3034.48 --> 3038.72
check your sentences before you click

3037.28 --> 3040.48
enter

3038.72 --> 3043.5989999999997
for real

3040.48 --> 3043.599
like the amount

3043.68 --> 3048.5589999999997
of errors i'm seeing like from everybody

3046.319 --> 3051.92
and you're smart people but

3048.559 --> 3055.8390000000004
like seriously

3051.92 --> 3059.44
just read it before you type enter and

3055.839 --> 3059.44
like read it for real

3061.119 --> 3066.079
don't just read it on whether it like

3064.0 --> 3068.4
feels like it expresses what you want to

3066.079 --> 3070.96
say actually check the grammar of what

3068.4 --> 3070.96
you're saying

3078.88 --> 3082.96
okay so you keep your old phone well

3080.559 --> 3083.92
like there's plenty of people

3082.96 --> 3086.96
right

3083.92 --> 3088.559
it just works like this like oh i broke

3086.96 --> 3089.839
the screen

3088.559 --> 3091.2000000000003
okay

3089.839 --> 3093.119
uh

3091.2 --> 3096.0
you'll just get a new one for like a

3093.119 --> 3097.6800000000003
fixed fee right that's the easiest

3096.0 --> 3100.16
that's what people do

3097.68 --> 3100.16
like it

3100.48 --> 3106.079
getting a new phone is kind of expensive

3103.839 --> 3107.92
if you don't hand in your old one

3106.079 --> 3110.48
from what i understand i don't have

3107.92 --> 3112.319
actual experience in this because i've

3110.48 --> 3114.0
never ever

3112.319 --> 3116.319
had a smartphone

3114.0 --> 3116.319
ever

3117.04 --> 3122.64
i think that the total amount

3119.839 --> 3125.2
of time that i've spent interfacing with

3122.64 --> 3126.0789999999997
like the freaking touch screen phone

3125.2 --> 3127.2799999999997
thing

3126.079 --> 3129.92
overall

3127.28 --> 3131.6800000000003
must have been a max of

3129.92 --> 3134.319
15 minutes

3131.68 --> 3138.7999999999997
my entire life

3134.319 --> 3141.599
yeah that's how much time i spent

3138.8 --> 3146.4
like iphones and all that

3141.599 --> 3151.6400000000003
smartphones a maximum total time of even

3146.4 --> 3151.64
interfacing 15 minutes that's it

3158.8 --> 3163.3590000000004
i've stared at screens

3161.119 --> 3166.76
a lot more but actually interacting with

3163.359 --> 3166.7599999999998
it no

3166.96 --> 3169.96
uh

3218.96 --> 3221.28
huh

3219.839 --> 3223.7599999999998
okay

3221.28 --> 3226.7200000000003
right so seriously guys i know

3223.76 --> 3229.8390000000004
absolutely nothing about

3226.72 --> 3233.16
smartphones i i just don't know anything

3229.839 --> 3233.16
about them

3238.8 --> 3243.6800000000003
i just know i see every time people

3241.76 --> 3246.48
always oh

3243.68 --> 3248.5589999999997
half the people i see always have some

3246.48 --> 3250.0
freaking cracked screen

3248.559 --> 3252.1600000000003
and they always have these stupid

3250.0 --> 3254.48
stories of like oh look i just got it

3252.16 --> 3257.2
and then it's it's only a week old i

3254.48 --> 3261.28
already got a crack it's like yeah

3257.2 --> 3261.2799999999997
yeah it's not you're not the only one

3261.599 --> 3266.4
that's like half the people

3264.559 --> 3269.7200000000003
that i bump into

3266.4 --> 3269.7200000000003
with the phone

3295.2 --> 3301.5589999999997
a pc

3296.88 --> 3301.559
it didn't have an ssd wow

3306.48 --> 3308.72
huh

3319.119 --> 3324.4
i don't know anyone who hands a phone

3322.4 --> 3329.079
back when broken

3324.4 --> 3329.079
or they are done what does that mean

3360.72 --> 3366.2799999999997
no david hall i don't know anything

3362.96 --> 3366.28
about that

3376.72 --> 3381.7599999999998
is that a recent development or are you

3378.48 --> 3385.0
talking about like

3381.76 --> 3385.0
the 40s

3420.64 --> 3423.64
huh

3434.64 --> 3436.96
wow

3440.96 --> 3446.359
okay david hold i take it that's in the

3443.359 --> 3446.359
past

3446.48 --> 3452.079
i mean if that had recently happened i

3448.799 --> 3454.319
think we'd be hearing about it a lot

3452.079 --> 3454.319
uh

3457.28 --> 3461.8390000000004
wrote a manifest dude i'm not really

3462.72 --> 3466.72
super interested

3464.72 --> 3469.1189999999997
although

3466.72 --> 3472.359
yeah maybe it will it will get to that

3469.119 --> 3472.359
what 2011.

3476.72 --> 3482.64
oh wait was it that guy

3479.44 --> 3483.52
i think i remembered now

3482.64 --> 3485.359
what

3483.52 --> 3488.359
really they were all

3485.359 --> 3488.359
communists

3489.44 --> 3493.44
i don't know about that dude it just

3491.76 --> 3496.88
seemed like kind of

3493.44 --> 3496.88
a crazy shooter

3498.559 --> 3503.559
i don't know if we're talking about the

3499.839 --> 3503.5589999999997
same thing but

3511.68 --> 3516.68
everybody knows that story oh really

3539.04 --> 3544.119
on the island what island

3568.799 --> 3572.04
oh wow

3572.72 --> 3577.8799999999997
that's

3574.16 --> 3577.8799999999997
kind of messed up

3594.559 --> 3599.44
like for real that is i don't know man

3597.28 --> 3600.88
i i can't just straight out say oh

3599.44 --> 3603.28
that's so cool

3600.88 --> 3605.28
because oh

3603.28 --> 3606.48
no i mean if it

3605.28 --> 3609.76
like

3606.48 --> 3611.68
i don't even understand like

3609.76 --> 3614.2400000000002
a bunch of youngsters

3611.68 --> 3617.1189999999997
really

3614.24 --> 3618.16
they were all evil they were all like oh

3617.119 --> 3620.2400000000002
they're gonna

3618.16 --> 3621.92
we're going to like take down the world

3620.24 --> 3623.5989999999997
like were they all just

3621.92 --> 3626.079
being trained

3623.599 --> 3628.96
as like communist operatives or were

3626.079 --> 3631.3590000000004
they just happen to be

3628.96 --> 3634.319
in those circles you know i mean if he

3631.359 --> 3636.799
had like taken out like the real bad

3634.319 --> 3639.7599999999998
teachers that do like creepy [ __ ] up

3636.799 --> 3643.599
initiations and conditioning and [ __ ]

3639.76 --> 3647.599
i get it but like everybody

3643.599 --> 3651.28
that seems well literally overkill

3647.599 --> 3651.28
very cruel actually

3652.079 --> 3655.079
uh

3660.16 --> 3663.16
so

3670.24 --> 3674.799
dude

3671.599 --> 3677.2000000000003
i have to go there

3674.799 --> 3677.2
it's like

3683.68 --> 3688.48
like service day what would you even

3685.76 --> 3690.2400000000002
want with that

3688.48 --> 3692.88
what are you gonna do with that book

3690.24 --> 3697.5589999999997
like what is it

3692.88 --> 3697.559
good for at this point nothing

3704.16 --> 3707.359
i mean

3705.44 --> 3708.4
the best you could get out of it is just

3707.359 --> 3709.7599999999998
like the

3708.4 --> 3712.48
mindset

3709.76 --> 3714.88
of what was going on

3712.48 --> 3720.119
that's pretty much it that's like all

3714.88 --> 3720.119
like it's like a historical relic now

3743.28 --> 3748.44
party members

3745.44 --> 3748.44
hmm

3759.119 --> 3762.799
okay david hall dude

3761.52 --> 3766.44
i'm not gonna

3762.799 --> 3766.44
comment on that

3778.16 --> 3783.52
i mean if he was like in the knowledge

3781.2 --> 3786.3999999999996
that they have always already committed

3783.52 --> 3788.4
like savage atrocities

3786.4 --> 3791.039
like in secret or whatever and they try

3788.4 --> 3793.44
to recruit him too in it

3791.039 --> 3795.3590000000004
then i kind of get it

3793.44 --> 3797.839
but if they were like just because

3795.359 --> 3797.839
you're even

3800.96 --> 3807.119
just because you're like on the wrong

3802.96 --> 3807.119
side doesn't automatically

3807.359 --> 3814.96
like make you guilty or anything right

3811.599 --> 3818.0
but they were definitely already guilty

3814.96 --> 3819.28
of things of atrocities for political

3818.0 --> 3822.0
power

3819.28 --> 3824.0
in initiations or whatever

3822.0 --> 3826.079
yeah

3824.0 --> 3828.799
then it would kind of make sense a bit

3826.079 --> 3830.96
it's still very crude

3828.799 --> 3830.96
but

3832.4 --> 3838.0
i don't know man this is just all dude

3835.119 --> 3840.799
this is like this is just completely

3838.0 --> 3843.76
ruining the atmosphere here

3840.799 --> 3846.48
i don't know why you had to

3843.76 --> 3848.48
draw that in like why

3846.48 --> 3853.0
why did you even bring him up like you

3848.48 --> 3853.0
think that's a good idea to do that

3855.44 --> 3858.079
i don't get it

3863.599 --> 3873.119
he tried to stop marx yeah but he did it

3868.88 --> 3876.6800000000003
in a very crude and well

3873.119 --> 3876.6800000000003
evil way

3891.359 --> 3894.68
i don't know

3905.92 --> 3911.839
taking these marks yeah but

3909.839 --> 3913.7599999999998
yeah but david whole

3911.839 --> 3916.5589999999997
not preemptively

3913.76 --> 3918.7200000000003
like what this guy obviously did is

3916.559 --> 3921.039
basically preemptive

3918.72 --> 3921.0389999999998
well

3921.44 --> 3926.16
it's already way too late for that it's

3924.72 --> 3929.52
already

3926.16 --> 3929.52
too late for that now

3929.599 --> 3934.48
so it's not

3930.799 --> 3936.88
a similar example

3934.48 --> 3938.72
because what i kind of suggested is is

3936.88 --> 3941.119
more just like

3938.72 --> 3944.0
direct opposition

3941.119 --> 3945.839
to the autocracy like now that it is

3944.0 --> 3949.039
unfold now that

3945.839 --> 3950.48
people have actually done this [ __ ]

3949.039 --> 3952.0
right

3950.48 --> 3956.319
now you have

3952.0 --> 3957.839
like in a way a righteous excuse

3956.319 --> 3961.68
if you then

3957.839 --> 3964.0789999999997
do that theoretically allegedly

3961.68 --> 3967.9199999999996
before even this all would have unfolded

3964.079 --> 3970.4
right let's just imagine oh we're gonna

3967.92 --> 3975.599
like sneak attack

3970.4 --> 3977.039
like fouchy or whatever like in 2018.

3975.599 --> 3979.839
uh

3977.039 --> 3979.8390000000004
that makes no sense

3980.24 --> 3985.4399999999996
that

3981.68 --> 3985.44
that would not have the same

3988.0 --> 3993.359
effect i guess right now

3990.799 --> 3995.52
it's unfolded it's already underway now

3993.359 --> 3997.119
it requires more action

3995.52 --> 3998.64
and it's not going to be just an easy

3997.119 --> 4000.6400000000003
win

3998.64 --> 4003.839
so it's different

4000.64 --> 4007.359
i'm more talking about like

4003.839 --> 4010.0789999999997
militant occupational strategy not just

4007.359 --> 4014.64
like freaking assassinate a whole bunch

4010.079 --> 4014.6400000000003
of people i never said it like that

4019.68 --> 4024.24
this is more about like militant

4021.44 --> 4024.2400000000002
occupation

4025.599 --> 4029.3590000000004
not just

4027.68 --> 4032.0789999999997
take out a whole bunch of people

4029.359 --> 4035.119
preemptively that's

4032.079 --> 4039.319
that's not really effective and

4035.119 --> 4039.319
it just makes everything worse

4049.28 --> 4053.44
i mean if if something like that is

4051.28 --> 4055.52
gonna happen now it's just gonna be like

4053.44 --> 4058.079
civil war [ __ ] and everybody's gonna

4055.52 --> 4060.319
start shooting everybody

4058.079 --> 4060.319
right

4061.68 --> 4066.3999999999996
now the main strategy should be

4064.24 --> 4069.2
to counter the corruption which is what

4066.4 --> 4070.0
is going on it's like blatant corruption

4069.2 --> 4073.4399999999996
of

4070.0 --> 4073.44
the judicial system of

4074.559 --> 4079.3590000000004
of media

4077.119 --> 4082.079
of the political system

4079.359 --> 4082.96
those three primarily

4082.079 --> 4088.319
and

4082.96 --> 4090.88
they bluff with their corrupted power

4088.319 --> 4092.48
but it's still bluff because their their

4090.88 --> 4095.119
foundations are corrupted they're

4092.48 --> 4096.96
actually doing illegal things so

4095.119 --> 4099.4400000000005
in my opinion

4096.96 --> 4103.199
my view the the proper way would be to

4099.44 --> 4105.919999999999
have a militant response not like

4103.199 --> 4108.719
like a [ __ ] [ __ ] no

4105.92 --> 4111.279
militant occupation

4108.719 --> 4113.359
getting to the people

4111.279 --> 4117.040000000001
the key people that are corrupted that

4113.359 --> 4120.400000000001
are making it work the way it does

4117.04 --> 4123.2789999999995
getting them not just to kill them

4120.4 --> 4123.2789999999995
to arrest them

4127.839 --> 4131.44
and then like yeah

4129.92 --> 4133.52
once

4131.44 --> 4135.678999999999
the corrupted situation has been

4133.52 --> 4138.319
neutralized the key people that are

4135.679 --> 4142.0
keeping it that way are taken

4138.319 --> 4145.04
out of the game not killed but just

4142.0 --> 4147.12
no longer able to act and to make it

4145.04 --> 4149.199
work the way it did

4147.12 --> 4151.2789999999995
then you can start like

4149.199 --> 4154.4
thinking about how i'm how are we

4151.279 --> 4156.2390000000005
actually going to judge these people

4154.4 --> 4158.639999999999
in accordance with the laws that have

4156.239 --> 4160.718999999999
already broken like how do you deal with

4158.64 --> 4162.96
all the law breaking the preponderance

4160.719 --> 4164.4800000000005
of it

4162.96 --> 4166.4800000000005
right

4164.48 --> 4167.919999999999
it's not just like oh go in there just

4166.48 --> 4170.159
shoot it all no

4167.92 --> 4172.4
this is a giant mess it doesn't work

4170.159 --> 4174.799
it's only gonna inflame it

4172.4 --> 4176.799
it's like

4174.799 --> 4179.12
shooting in a cancer it's gonna make the

4176.799 --> 4179.92
cancer more violent

4179.12 --> 4181.199
no

4179.92 --> 4183.52
you gotta

4181.199 --> 4186.0
corner it off

4183.52 --> 4187.679
and then remove it in a single go

4186.0 --> 4190.159
because if you don't

4187.679 --> 4193.12
there's something

4190.159 --> 4195.679
still left and tangled

4193.12 --> 4197.5199999999995
it's gonna explode a lot of the time

4195.679 --> 4199.679
it's gonna actually get a lot worse and

4197.52 --> 4204.4800000000005
more aggressive

4199.679 --> 4204.4800000000005
right so that's my view on that

4204.88 --> 4208.8
and i find it kind of off-putting that

4207.04 --> 4209.76
you say

4208.8 --> 4212.96
that

4209.76 --> 4216.08
that idea i had and i tried to express a

4212.96 --> 4216.96
militant occupation

4216.08 --> 4220.0
be

4216.96 --> 4221.679
in the same trainer thinking as that guy

4220.0 --> 4223.199
in norway

4221.679 --> 4225.52
that just murdered a whole bunch of

4223.199 --> 4225.5199999999995
people

4226.239 --> 4230.12
even though yeah

4231.92 --> 4236.0
even though they might have all been

4233.6 --> 4237.52
[ __ ] up or could have become very

4236.0 --> 4238.88
[ __ ] up

4237.52 --> 4242.320000000001
that's true

4238.88 --> 4242.32
but it's still no it's not

4242.48 --> 4248.4
it's not a viable strategy to actually

4245.199 --> 4252.678999999999
stop all this from happening you see

4248.4 --> 4252.679
wrath invokes wrath correct

4259.36 --> 4264.159
right i mean as soon as like

4261.92 --> 4266.0
real

4264.159 --> 4269.199
black

4266.0 --> 4272.239
dressed military forces literally start

4269.199 --> 4274.4
shooting people in the streets and like

4272.239 --> 4277.36
as a norm right

4274.4 --> 4279.12
like suddenly it's really movie like

4277.36 --> 4281.36
nazi behavior

4279.12 --> 4284.32
super autocratic with just

4281.36 --> 4286.4
death punishment and [ __ ]

4284.32 --> 4289.84
or literally just beating up people in

4286.4 --> 4289.839999999999
the street really bad

4290.159 --> 4294.159
not yeah well yeah

4292.159 --> 4294.96
australia

4294.159 --> 4296.4
right

4294.96 --> 4298.32
that's when

4296.4 --> 4300.639999999999
kind of like yeah

4298.32 --> 4302.96
it becomes different but up until that

4300.64 --> 4302.96
point

4303.6 --> 4308.64
you could still go after the apparatus

4306.88 --> 4311.04
that might that

4308.64 --> 4314.6
is partially responsible for unleashing

4311.04 --> 4314.6
that sort of thing

4330.159 --> 4334.4
killing a citizen's word of government

4332.159 --> 4337.679
why not the opposite way around

4334.4 --> 4340.639999999999
because then you are exactly

4337.679 --> 4344.08
as evil as the government david oh don't

4340.64 --> 4347.679
you get that this is basic morality

4344.08 --> 4347.679
basic morality

4350.08 --> 4353.84
what you want to

4351.76 --> 4355.92
you want to be that evil government

4353.84 --> 4357.360000000001
except you're going to be evil to the

4355.92 --> 4359.52
evil people

4357.36 --> 4362.239
not the innocent people

4359.52 --> 4362.2390000000005
really

4364.8 --> 4370.96
no

4366.88 --> 4373.679
no the problem is the evil and you can't

4370.96 --> 4377.44
get rid of the evil

4373.679 --> 4380.88
by replacing it you see

4377.44 --> 4380.879999999999
it's a systemic problem

4383.44 --> 4387.04
killing evil's morally just

4387.76 --> 4392.320000000001
the action perhaps

4389.76 --> 4394.08
but what about the results

4392.32 --> 4397.08
david have you ever thought about the

4394.08 --> 4397.08
results

4411.52 --> 4414.719
yeah i think your

4413.679 --> 4418.719
moral

4414.719 --> 4418.719
awareness is a little underdeveloped

4419.199 --> 4423.678999999999
it's not so black and white simple i

4421.76 --> 4426.0
mean

4423.679 --> 4427.679
what is true and what is lies yes that

4426.0 --> 4429.36
is black and white

4427.679 --> 4432.64
but

4429.36 --> 4432.639999999999
how things work

4433.199 --> 4440.879999999999
and results and all that they aren't

4437.92 --> 4444.1990000000005
let's try to be real here

4440.88 --> 4446.2390000000005
let's not try to adapt reality to your

4444.199 --> 4449.44
oversimplified view of things but

4446.239 --> 4452.599999999999
instead you adapt to the complications

4449.44 --> 4452.599999999999
of reality

4464.719 --> 4467.719
um

4475.28 --> 4478.28
mm-hmm

4504.8 --> 4509.719
hold on i need to open the door for

4506.32 --> 4509.719
somebody else

4536.0 --> 4539.479
[Music]

4563.44 --> 4566.44
huh

4566.8 --> 4572.92
yeah somebody

4568.08 --> 4572.92
collecting a package that was left here

4593.52 --> 4599.120000000001
all right

4595.04 --> 4601.199
yeah david talk correct i agree

4599.12 --> 4603.599999999999
inaction

4601.199 --> 4606.32
makes things more complex but what type

4603.6 --> 4607.679
of action you see

4606.32 --> 4608.5599999999995
if you

4607.679 --> 4611.52
like

4608.56 --> 4614.0
get very fatalistic

4611.52 --> 4615.280000000001
in your actions

4614.0 --> 4617.84
then

4615.28 --> 4620.32
it's not gonna have a stabilizing result

4617.84 --> 4623.84
like isn't this action

4620.32 --> 4625.5199999999995
motivated by the need to stabilize all

4623.84 --> 4627.12
this to stop it

4625.52 --> 4629.4400000000005
right well if you're going to draw in

4627.12 --> 4631.12
like fatalistic

4629.44 --> 4633.199
approaches

4631.12 --> 4635.679
it's not going to have that intended

4633.199 --> 4637.44
result it's just going to be your moment

4635.679 --> 4639.4400000000005
where you need to squirt

4637.44 --> 4642.48
basically

4639.44 --> 4645.5199999999995
and it just causes more damage

4642.48 --> 4645.5199999999995
do you understand that

4646.4 --> 4650.799999999999
it's now slaughtering

4648.4 --> 4655.36
militant occupation

4650.8 --> 4658.08
by very disciplined and informed people

4655.36 --> 4662.44
that really know what's going on and

4658.08 --> 4662.44
what is required of them

4722.56 --> 4725.96
all right anyway

4771.199 --> 4775.28
that's insane david hall

4773.44 --> 4777.839999999999
you really need to check your moral

4775.28 --> 4777.84
confess

4779.28 --> 4783.84
you really do

4781.28 --> 4786.4
you sound damaged like everything i've

4783.84 --> 4786.400000000001
just said

4786.48 --> 4788.799999999999
does not

4787.76 --> 4791.84
match

4788.8 --> 4791.84
what you just said

4793.6 --> 4798.159000000001
i don't think you you got out of it what

4796.0 --> 4802.92
i was actually trying to share

4798.159 --> 4802.92
if that is really your statement there

4806.56 --> 4811.280000000001
yeah you're insane dude i'm not

4808.96 --> 4815.679
appreciating this anymore

4811.28 --> 4816.48
right i've been patient you seem to be

4815.679 --> 4819.12
just

4816.48 --> 4822.239
consumed by a spirit of murder

4819.12 --> 4824.08
and i don't wanna

4822.239 --> 4826.879999999999
deal with you

4824.08 --> 4828.88
if you're gonna be like that

4826.88 --> 4830.84
i just tried to give you some really

4828.88 --> 4833.76
serious

4830.84 --> 4835.6
considerations and you've proven with

4833.76 --> 4838.08
everything you're saying right now that

4835.6 --> 4839.1990000000005
you literally don't give a [ __ ] you just

4838.08 --> 4842.32
want to

4839.199 --> 4843.678999999999
you just want to kill the baddies

4842.32 --> 4846.96
like some

4843.679 --> 4849.36
video game idiot has no more moral

4846.96 --> 4849.36
compass

4849.6 --> 4854.639
i do not appreciate that

4852.719 --> 4857.36
i heard what you said i don't agree with

4854.639 --> 4861.159000000001
you right yeah yeah so you're just

4857.36 --> 4861.159
insane okay

4862.32 --> 4866.28
what

4863.28 --> 4866.28
yeah

4877.28 --> 4881.44
right

4879.36 --> 4883.28
yeah i can also assure you that you are

4881.44 --> 4885.599999999999
on a watch list

4883.28 --> 4887.759999999999
i can assure you that

4885.6 --> 4890.56
because people that talk like that and

4887.76 --> 4892.400000000001
that really have no moral

4890.56 --> 4894.56
restraint

4892.4 --> 4896.0
those are considered actual dangerous

4894.56 --> 4897.92
people like

4896.0 --> 4899.84
i might be on like

4897.92 --> 4903.84
maybe a watch list but i don't think so

4899.84 --> 4903.84
because i have absolutely no record

4904.48 --> 4910.08
where it it leads me to be sized up as

4907.6 --> 4911.1990000000005
something that inevitably is going to do

4910.08 --> 4913.199
something

4911.199 --> 4916.08
idiotic like that

4913.199 --> 4919.04
the way you're talking you do you

4916.08 --> 4919.04
understand david hall

4919.36 --> 4922.88
you understand that this is a public

4921.12 --> 4925.599999999999
platform and everything you've said in

4922.88 --> 4927.6
chat is literally visible to everybody

4925.6 --> 4931.1990000000005
including

4927.6 --> 4933.76
like data leaching operations including

4931.199 --> 4933.759999999999
tactical

4935.04 --> 4938.239
and security based

4938.32 --> 4942.84
so if you're really like if that is your

4941.199 --> 4946.08
opinion you

4942.84 --> 4949.04
are not that yeah well

4946.08 --> 4951.44
you're considered a danger to society

4949.04 --> 4951.44
because

4951.52 --> 4957.6
you don't seem to be

4953.52 --> 4960.88
really capable of grasping

4957.6 --> 4960.88
moral complexities

4961.76 --> 4966.96
it's just a discussion yeah yeah but i

4964.0 --> 4971.239
guarantee you you are on a watch list

4966.96 --> 4971.2390000000005
if that is your actual stance

4978.4 --> 4985.239
yeah a logical conclusion i think he is

4980.88 --> 4985.2390000000005
i definitely think he is

4986.0 --> 4990.48
right

4987.199 --> 4993.12
yeah people that post messages and then

4990.48 --> 4996.0
immediately retract them

4993.12 --> 4999.4
as a first entry are banned i don't care

4996.0 --> 4999.4
who you are

5002.08 --> 5008.0
your first

5003.36 --> 5008.0
entry sentence should be hello

5009.6 --> 5012.719
and not

5011.199 --> 5015.04
quickly say something and then retract

5012.719 --> 5018.04
retracted that means you're banned

5015.04 --> 5018.04
immediately

5030.56 --> 5038.56
what your ex david oh lord no i wouldn't

5034.88 --> 5040.88
you're only exploring

5038.56 --> 5043.280000000001
terrorist assaults on political

5040.88 --> 5044.159000000001
opponents oh okay

5043.28 --> 5046.32
sure

5044.159 --> 5048.719
just talking about just exploring like

5046.32 --> 5050.799999999999
oh maybe that's a good idea

5048.719 --> 5052.4800000000005
yeah

5050.8 --> 5054.400000000001
that's all

5052.48 --> 5057.839999999999
uh

5054.4 --> 5057.839999999999
good luck with that

5058.96 --> 5061.199
cut

5067.679 --> 5070.639
get contained

5071.76 --> 5074.92
all right

5130.639 --> 5134.08
oh we do

5132.0 --> 5136.0
no it's not true service day

5134.08 --> 5138.32
just waking up is not gonna make them

5136.0 --> 5140.639
lose are the powers it's just gonna make

5138.32 --> 5142.88
them move on to a more aggressive more

5140.639 --> 5145.1990000000005
overt strategy

5142.88 --> 5147.84
and that mechanism

5145.199 --> 5152.638999999999
keeps going

5147.84 --> 5152.639
like it doesn't like it's not gonna stop

5153.679 --> 5159.36
until like their side is just completely

5157.28 --> 5163.199
gone

5159.36 --> 5166.48
but you can't quickly

5163.199 --> 5168.48
surgically remove them

5166.48 --> 5171.599999999999
you have to approach this like a very

5168.48 --> 5171.599999999999
diseased patient

5173.28 --> 5177.92
can't just like

5175.28 --> 5181.5199999999995
get in there like immediately remove

5177.92 --> 5183.84
no that's just gonna kill the patient

5181.52 --> 5183.84
no

5184.639 --> 5188.719
gotta isolate the corruption

5189.12 --> 5193.04
then in one

5191.199 --> 5194.4
swoop

5193.04 --> 5197.28
remove it

5194.4 --> 5199.199
not just kill it because it has to be

5197.28 --> 5203.199
analyzed exposed for the corruption it

5199.199 --> 5205.5199999999995
like the corrupting effect has to be

5203.199 --> 5208.48
put on a pedestal

5205.52 --> 5208.4800000000005
as a deterrent

5208.8 --> 5212.8
has to be proper trials

5213.52 --> 5216.56
because otherwise

5215.28 --> 5218.159
it's

5216.56 --> 5220.639
there's a risk that it's just going to

5218.159 --> 5222.839999999999
come back again in another form and

5220.639 --> 5225.84
there's actually a big risk this is very

5222.84 --> 5227.52
typical when there's already fronts

5225.84 --> 5229.6
of some sort

5227.52 --> 5232.080000000001
that as soon as like one front is

5229.6 --> 5236.84
defeated the other one takes over and

5232.08 --> 5236.84
starts doing it on the same level

5251.36 --> 5256.0
biblical times require biblical morality

5254.4 --> 5260.36
that's not a

5256.0 --> 5260.36
that's a pretty good statement there

5272.88 --> 5276.159000000001
we will never be shut down

5276.56 --> 5280.360000000001
you don't know about that

5282.239 --> 5286.638999999999
but

5283.84 --> 5288.56
if they do shut us down if they get all

5286.639 --> 5290.56
drastic and

5288.56 --> 5292.080000000001
like overkill

5290.56 --> 5295.679
then with

5292.08 --> 5297.6
among them will rise

5295.679 --> 5299.36
newer generations that by their own

5297.6 --> 5301.52
volition

5299.36 --> 5304.159
need to be good

5301.52 --> 5306.56
demand the world changes for the better

5304.159 --> 5309.04
actual better not just party politics

5306.56 --> 5311.76
better because newer generations they

5309.04 --> 5313.84
will become completely impervious

5311.76 --> 5315.52
to political jargon

5313.84 --> 5318.0
completely imperfect they will just

5315.52 --> 5319.92
instantly recognize it as

5318.0 --> 5324.08
that's real communication that's

5319.92 --> 5324.08
political talk and they will not be

5324.56 --> 5330.0
kept stuck

5326.719 --> 5331.52
anymore they will evolve

5330.0 --> 5333.28
spiritually

5331.52 --> 5334.96
to literally know what it is and they

5333.28 --> 5337.44
will not be influenced and they will

5334.96 --> 5339.76
start resisting again and go

5337.44 --> 5342.48
we will rise again

5339.76 --> 5343.679
you can't stop it just like you can't

5342.48 --> 5345.839999999999
permanently

5343.679 --> 5347.4400000000005
remove the darkness

5345.84 --> 5350.0
you can also

5347.44 --> 5351.759999999999
never permanently remove the light it

5350.0 --> 5354.639
needs the light

5351.76 --> 5359.8
the world needs the light in people or

5354.639 --> 5359.8
it all collapses like really collapses

5364.88 --> 5371.28
because then morality collapses it like

5367.679 --> 5374.8
morality is not just a code of conduct

5371.28 --> 5377.36
it's also energy energy we all share we

5374.8 --> 5381.52
feed off the energy of

5377.36 --> 5384.48
of morality of real morality

5381.52 --> 5385.92
like we literally need it

5384.48 --> 5388.799999999999
for strength

5385.92 --> 5390.88
now if morality basic morality is no

5388.8 --> 5392.8
longer allowed

5390.88 --> 5393.92
then everybody

5392.8 --> 5397.679
will

5393.92 --> 5400.719
start withering under the lack of it and

5397.679 --> 5403.76
die like really die

5400.719 --> 5406.719
they can't get rid of good they can

5403.76 --> 5410.88
never succeed like they know they can't

5406.719 --> 5410.88
they can't just do a lot of damage

5417.12 --> 5423.92
but we should realize that it's the same

5421.44 --> 5423.919999999999
for us

5425.04 --> 5429.36
you can never prevent things from

5427.12 --> 5430.159
corrupting

5429.36 --> 5433.48
that

5430.159 --> 5433.48
it's impossible

5434.0 --> 5440.08
but you just can give a lot of good

5436.56 --> 5443.04
guidance for those that don't corrupt

5440.08 --> 5445.12
to stay afloat and

5443.04 --> 5449.639
basically

5445.12 --> 5449.639
allow good to dominate

5450.239 --> 5455.759999999999
for the morality to echo and make it an

5453.28 --> 5458.159
example for newer generations to also

5455.76 --> 5460.159000000001
take on mission on the same level with

5458.159 --> 5462.4
the lessons learned much quicker because

5460.159 --> 5464.719
they don't have to figure it out all by

5462.4 --> 5466.5599999999995
themselves in a wild crazy world against

5464.719 --> 5468.8
them

5466.56 --> 5468.8
so

5472.48 --> 5474.718999999999
yeah

5475.12 --> 5478.88
my solution

5476.719 --> 5481.6
that i've talked about is militant

5478.88 --> 5484.2390000000005
occupation and that means people

5481.6 --> 5484.2390000000005
militant

5484.96 --> 5490.56
determine people that are ready for

5487.679 --> 5493.12
anything including the end to make the

5490.56 --> 5496.0
final moves to

5493.12 --> 5499.12
corner the corruption

5496.0 --> 5499.12
citizens arrest

5499.92 --> 5504.719
and then also protect that because yeah

5502.8 --> 5507.1990000000005
when that happens you might suddenly get

5504.719 --> 5509.84
attacked

5507.199 --> 5511.28
by mercenary armies

5509.84 --> 5513.4400000000005
that's a risk

5511.28 --> 5517.679
and then if that happens like all hell

5513.44 --> 5521.12
will break loose like really seriously

5517.679 --> 5523.4400000000005
but if we don't then it's a slow choking

5521.12 --> 5527.599999999999
death for everybody and everything until

5523.44 --> 5530.239
people no longer even remember

5527.6 --> 5530.2390000000005
reality

5530.88 --> 5537.1990000000005
you can't sit through a long haul

5534.56 --> 5538.88
if you already know and can deduce that

5537.199 --> 5541.678999999999
at the end you will not have the

5538.88 --> 5544.679
faculties to even remember what you're

5541.679 --> 5544.679
doing

5565.28 --> 5569.759999999999
about the french revolution the french

5567.6 --> 5572.159000000001
revolution was a communist revolution

5569.76 --> 5575.52
actually david hall

5572.159 --> 5577.679
it's it was literally the start

5575.52 --> 5581.4400000000005
of the beast revolution

5577.679 --> 5581.4400000000005
that's what the french revolution was

5583.679 --> 5588.1990000000005
it's very very hijacked

5590.239 --> 5595.12
you you didn't know that

5592.88 --> 5599.4800000000005
you're just hungry for blood

5595.12 --> 5599.48
you don't see it anymore do you

5623.12 --> 5630.719
yeah dave without dude

5625.36 --> 5631.92
guys like david hall is a guy that is

5630.719 --> 5633.92
scarred

5631.92 --> 5636.96
and partially possessed maybe

5633.92 --> 5639.84
permanently by iri man spirit of iron

5636.96 --> 5643.28
we're we have a guy here in the chat

5639.84 --> 5646.159000000001
that is obsessed with death

5643.28 --> 5648.5599999999995
and when you obsess over death you lose

5646.159 --> 5650.96
the subtleties

5648.56 --> 5652.719
you lose your subtle sentence it's

5650.96 --> 5654.0
literally burned out you don't care

5652.719 --> 5656.56
anymore

5654.0 --> 5659.04
and then eventually you also lose the

5656.56 --> 5662.080000000001
care to distinguish

5659.04 --> 5665.44
moral from immoral that's the problem

5662.08 --> 5665.44
that's the problem david hall

5667.28 --> 5669.5199999999995
right

5670.8 --> 5675.679
you spend all your life

5673.04 --> 5678.0
fighting demons you become

5675.679 --> 5678.0
them

5683.199 --> 5688.96
yeah oh such a great idea david oh you

5686.0 --> 5691.119
have such a brilliant tactical mind just

5688.96 --> 5693.6
thinking of revolution friends got rid

5691.119 --> 5696.719
of the monarchy yeah and then you got

5693.6 --> 5697.52
[ __ ] jacobins

5696.719 --> 5701.44
yeah

5697.52 --> 5703.119000000001
the worst most immoral

5701.44 --> 5706.08
group

5703.119 --> 5706.08
of those times

5707.119 --> 5711.92
like

5708.639 --> 5715.04
anti-god not not even like oh we're in

5711.92 --> 5718.2390000000005
atheists no anti

5715.04 --> 5719.76
it was literally the beast breaking out

5718.239 --> 5722.718999999999
yeah i'm not saying that the french

5719.76 --> 5724.159000000001
nobility was great they had massive

5722.719 --> 5725.92
problems

5724.159 --> 5726.96
they were evil

5725.92 --> 5729.04
they were

5726.96 --> 5731.04
like insane

5729.04 --> 5734.0
and disgusting

5731.04 --> 5736.8
but who took over

5734.0 --> 5740.239
you do you even care

5736.8 --> 5741.52
or you just want slaughter you just want

5740.239 --> 5743.44
to kill you don't care for the

5741.52 --> 5745.4400000000005
consequences anymore from what i'm

5743.44 --> 5747.759999999999
reading here david hall you don't seem

5745.44 --> 5749.759999999999
to really care about the consequence you

5747.76 --> 5751.52
just want to slaughter

5749.76 --> 5754.92
that's arimon

5751.52 --> 5754.92
that's death

5778.32 --> 5782.639
overthrown by peaceful times no militant

5781.119 --> 5785.679
occupation

5782.639 --> 5788.4800000000005
right militant occupations usually

5785.679 --> 5791.4400000000005
happen by military military that is like

5788.48 --> 5793.839999999999
really nationalist

5791.44 --> 5797.5199999999995
like it happens in third world countries

5793.84 --> 5799.52
all the time and it's arguably corrupted

5797.52 --> 5800.719
some are more than others

5799.52 --> 5803.52
but that's how they do it's like

5800.719 --> 5805.28
government gets all like oh

5803.52 --> 5806.96
we're gonna just [ __ ] you up because

5805.28 --> 5809.28
we're in power and then the military

5806.96 --> 5811.36
coming like no you're not

5809.28 --> 5813.84
we're supplanting you

5811.36 --> 5813.839999999999
right

5814.08 --> 5818.159
well what

5815.84 --> 5821.28
if we try to somehow

5818.159 --> 5824.08
create a well a collective grassroots

5821.28 --> 5824.08
free people

5824.639 --> 5828.2390000000005
militant concept

5826.96 --> 5831.36
somehow

5828.239 --> 5833.919999999999
where we all just decide like yes

5831.36 --> 5833.92
we are

5834.08 --> 5839.04
like actual free people army

5836.96 --> 5841.76
like because we decide

5839.04 --> 5843.6
and we know how it works

5841.76 --> 5845.679
and yeah dave you're not going to be

5843.6 --> 5848.639
part of it because you're obsessed with

5845.679 --> 5849.92
death and slaughter yeah that's not what

5848.639 --> 5852.2390000000005
we need

5849.92 --> 5856.56
you see

5852.239 --> 5856.5599999999995
we need control stability

5857.119 --> 5863.0
wisdom

5859.6 --> 5863.0
not slaughter

5868.4 --> 5872.879999999999
like under the american yeah exactly

5870.639 --> 5875.52
exactly

5872.88 --> 5878.400000000001
right it should be there

5875.52 --> 5879.84
the second amendment is not

5878.4 --> 5883.92
a right

5879.84 --> 5886.32
to be fed like i i won again

5883.92 --> 5888.32
i have the right to get a gun like no

5886.32 --> 5890.719
it's about yeah

5888.32 --> 5892.799999999999
you have the right to self defense

5890.719 --> 5894.4800000000005
and it comes with a price and that price

5892.8 --> 5897.84
is

5894.48 --> 5900.4
you have to be citizen militant

5897.84 --> 5902.8
you have to actually

5900.4 --> 5906.48
uphold the duty

5902.8 --> 5907.76
to take out corrupted influences in your

5906.48 --> 5911.839999999999
government

5907.76 --> 5914.2390000000005
that's part of the contract

5911.84 --> 5916.96
it's not just oh everybody gets a free

5914.239 --> 5918.879999999999
gun no no it's actually rather a

5916.96 --> 5919.92
contract if you sign on to it if you

5918.88 --> 5922.08
agree

5919.92 --> 5924.719
second amendment you have the right to

5922.08 --> 5927.36
this do that well that also means the

5924.719 --> 5928.639
duty

5927.36 --> 5932.239
to actually

5928.639 --> 5933.679
uphold the contract you see

5932.239 --> 5936.959999999999
and that's what i like about it it's

5933.679 --> 5939.84
just that people seem to forget

5936.96 --> 5939.84
what it is

5948.719 --> 5953.28
right

5950.239 --> 5956.718999999999
and you have to because if you don't

5953.28 --> 5958.4
you're gonna lose it you can be

5956.719 --> 5960.719
like you could have a freaking bunker

5958.4 --> 5963.119
with the thousands of guns and rocket

5960.719 --> 5965.44
launchers and all that [ __ ]

5963.119 --> 5968.48
but if you're just if it's just gonna be

5965.44 --> 5971.5199999999995
a weapons cache that's it you think you

5968.48 --> 5971.5199999999995
can survive like

5972.32 --> 5974.96
an army

5975.199 --> 5981.5199999999995
oh if everybody else has it too they can

5979.04 --> 5982.719
go after us all yeah they can you know

5981.52 --> 5984.56
how they do it

5982.719 --> 5986.56
one by one

5984.56 --> 5988.4800000000005
one by one

5986.56 --> 5991.1990000000005
oh oh you you want to be last on that

5988.48 --> 5994.08
list no no no the point is

5991.199 --> 5996.159
you don't build a freaking bunker with

5994.08 --> 5998.0
weapons caches

5996.159 --> 6000.239
some hoarder

5998.0 --> 6002.8
now the point is

6000.239 --> 6006.959999999999
you take

6002.8 --> 6007.84
that militant duty of self-defense and

6006.96 --> 6009.28
you

6007.84 --> 6012.159000000001
organize

6009.28 --> 6014.48
to take out the corruption

6012.159 --> 6017.44
militantly to go in there and say you

6014.48 --> 6017.44
are under arrest

6020.0 --> 6024.639
that's actually what you're supposed to

6021.52 --> 6026.88
do not not just let it all go to [ __ ] as

6024.639 --> 6030.96
people are literally being like

6026.88 --> 6034.400000000001
sacrificed in the streets and like

6030.96 --> 6036.8
tortured and [ __ ] publicly and crazy

6034.4 --> 6039.44
[ __ ] and you're oh but i'm safe in my

6036.8 --> 6041.4400000000005
bunker with a huge amount of weapons i

6039.44 --> 6043.04
could take an army oh really you can't

6041.44 --> 6045.36
no you can't

6043.04 --> 6047.6
that's [ __ ]

6045.36 --> 6049.36
that's you cowering in your little

6047.6 --> 6051.119000000001
weaponized cave

6049.36 --> 6054.119
that's not what the second amendment is

6051.119 --> 6054.119
about

6071.36 --> 6074.799999999999
this is disgusting

6073.119 --> 6076.5599999999995
david hall

6074.8 --> 6078.88
i'm going to end up removing you if you

6076.56 --> 6082.320000000001
don't stop bringing up all these

6078.88 --> 6082.32
disgusting things

6085.36 --> 6090.719
you're just presenting this these things

6088.48 --> 6093.04
like they're good

6090.719 --> 6096.56
all of that everything you've given an

6093.04 --> 6098.719
example is evil corrupted garbage that

6096.56 --> 6102.719
has only made things work

6098.719 --> 6104.8
made people hate other people more

6102.719 --> 6106.88
all those actions you think are

6104.8 --> 6110.639
supposedly some kind of collusions have

6106.88 --> 6112.400000000001
only made things worse a lot worse

6110.639 --> 6115.28
do you even know what the [ __ ] you're

6112.4 --> 6115.28
doing david hall

6115.84 --> 6121.84
you're a real creep

6117.92 --> 6121.84
starting to piss me off

6138.32 --> 6141.32
what

6159.76 --> 6163.400000000001
hey steamy traveler

6166.96 --> 6171.4800000000005
oh hello by the way pj cruz shank

6205.28 --> 6209.04
service date

6207.76 --> 6210.8
check

6209.04 --> 6215.719
the sentence

6210.8 --> 6215.719
before enter not after

6238.08 --> 6242.159
what happens to the occupancy when the

6240.239 --> 6244.799999999999
army comes in

6242.159 --> 6248.32
it's a bloody shootout

6244.8 --> 6252.159000000001
or surrender and then the military is

6248.32 --> 6252.159
absolutely evil and

6252.719 --> 6257.679
yeah if that happens then it's going to

6254.96 --> 6263.04
be guerrilla war and like literally

6257.679 --> 6264.2390000000005
snipers just shooting the military

6263.04 --> 6267.76
constantly

6264.239 --> 6270.48
like yeah if military actually

6267.76 --> 6272.0
starts preventing

6270.48 --> 6273.28
the corruption

6272.0 --> 6275.92
in their own country they're not even

6273.28 --> 6278.96
allowed to operate in their own country

6275.92 --> 6282.639
right officially lawfully so if they do

6278.96 --> 6284.8
then they are an invading military force

6282.639 --> 6286.84
even though they're supposedly the the

6284.8 --> 6291.6
military of that

6286.84 --> 6291.6
country and yeah that means war

6294.88 --> 6299.76
and it would be in their best interest

6296.96 --> 6299.76
not to do that

6301.28 --> 6306.08
because i think that if the military

6303.84 --> 6309.4400000000005
goes to that direction it might also

6306.08 --> 6312.159
like split up in factions

6309.44 --> 6313.04
but those that are actually gonna

6312.159 --> 6315.04
like

6313.04 --> 6317.84
just side

6315.04 --> 6317.84
like against

6318.0 --> 6320.8
against the people

6319.6 --> 6323.119000000001
and gonna

6320.8 --> 6325.1990000000005
back atrocities and a communist

6323.119 --> 6330.04
occupation they're all going to end up

6325.199 --> 6330.04
being executed every single one

6331.04 --> 6335.5199999999995
right so i wouldn't go there if i were

6333.199 --> 6335.5199999999995
them

6338.96 --> 6342.84
right they don't have to do that they

6340.96 --> 6345.36
can just be the

6342.84 --> 6350.0
military and

6345.36 --> 6351.44
let the people get rid of the corruption

6350.0 --> 6353.04
and they can do

6351.44 --> 6356.36
what they're actually supposed to be

6353.04 --> 6356.36
doing again

6376.719 --> 6379.719
so

6388.88 --> 6393.119
don't forget the rogan's up yeah maybe

6391.28 --> 6395.28
i'm gonna round out the show this is not

6393.119 --> 6398.28
gonna get any more

6395.28 --> 6398.28
pleasant

6410.239 --> 6414.879999999999
hmm all right bex

6412.8 --> 6418.56
thanks yeah i've met

6414.88 --> 6421.1990000000005
i've met some people that had like

6418.56 --> 6423.679
parents that were like 50

6421.199 --> 6427.36
when they were born

6423.679 --> 6427.36
so it gives me some hope

6427.52 --> 6432.080000000001
because

6429.76 --> 6432.08
yeah

6433.199 --> 6438.879999999999
at least i'm not like

6435.199 --> 6440.799999999999
visibly aging or anything so

6438.88 --> 6442.2390000000005
right anyway i'll be right back in two

6440.8 --> 6445.56
minutes and then i'm probably gonna run

6442.239 --> 6445.5599999999995
out the show

6461.199 --> 6464.199
so

6525.6 --> 6528.659000000001
[Music]

6532.88 --> 6537.28
yes

6535.119 --> 6539.44
yes service date no it's good to have

6537.28 --> 6543.679
had this conversation

6539.44 --> 6543.678999999999
even though i don't really like like it

6548.8 --> 6552.88
but i guess it is all very relevant

6553.199 --> 6558.879999999999
and it's very tricky to find anybody

6555.28 --> 6561.04
talking about this that isn't gonna like

6558.88 --> 6563.04
get out of control and sloppy because

6561.04 --> 6565.92
it's really tough it's tough to deal

6563.04 --> 6568.639
with this tension

6565.92 --> 6571.36
what's going on out there

6568.639 --> 6573.28
like most people will respond either

6571.36 --> 6575.5199999999995
completely trying to forget about it

6573.28 --> 6577.92
don't want to have any association or

6575.52 --> 6579.92
anything to do with it to escape from it

6577.92 --> 6581.36
or they'll get on it and get all right

6579.92 --> 6583.599
attack them no

6581.36 --> 6586.799999999999
this is that's

6583.599 --> 6588.56
how most people will respond to those

6586.8 --> 6592.159000000001
tensions

6588.56 --> 6594.88
it's very tough to keep your focus

6592.159 --> 6597.119
try to stay real

6594.88 --> 6599.1990000000005
when you're dealing with this

6597.119 --> 6601.199
so i guess it's good to have addressed

6599.199 --> 6604.638999999999
it

6601.199 --> 6606.96
although yeah david hall is like

6604.639 --> 6606.96
you're

6608.159 --> 6612.239
you're kind of on my bad news list now

6613.119 --> 6616.08
which by the way

6618.159 --> 6621.48
this is

6625.119 --> 6630.88
yeah so is george sanford right away for

6627.28 --> 6634.48
a while but yeah david whole worst cat

6630.88 --> 6634.4800000000005
just stop whining cats

6636.84 --> 6641.360000000001
hey freaking

6639.04 --> 6641.36
cat

6642.4 --> 6647.04
welcome to the club david

6644.96 --> 6651.08
oh wow so you even recognize the dude

6647.04 --> 6651.08
george stanford alrighty

6656.0 --> 6660.0
all right but it's still look

6658.159 --> 6662.08
it's not banned

6660.0 --> 6664.88
but i am gonna get

6662.08 --> 6667.5199999999995
i'm gonna get stick and basically start

6664.88 --> 6670.0
slapping your fingers

6667.52 --> 6671.84
because i think that you need the pain

6670.0 --> 6673.04
of having your fingers slapped to get

6671.84 --> 6675.28
through you

6673.04 --> 6676.639
if you have these kind of weird moral

6675.28 --> 6677.84
compass

6676.639 --> 6681.28
issues

6677.84 --> 6683.52
where you seem just very numb down

6681.28 --> 6685.199
yeah that's gonna require me to get

6683.52 --> 6688.0
harsh

6685.199 --> 6689.5199999999995
to get from the old block that's how you

6688.0 --> 6692.56
need to deal with that

6689.52 --> 6692.56
that's my experience

6692.719 --> 6698.56
right old hard teachers

6696.0 --> 6701.04
are essential in a time when there's a

6698.56 --> 6703.679
lot of trauma going around

6701.04 --> 6704.719
especially wartime

6703.679 --> 6707.119
right

6704.719 --> 6709.52
like directly after the war lots of

6707.119 --> 6710.96
strict teachers because that's that's

6709.52 --> 6713.360000000001
what kept

6710.96 --> 6717.119
it afloat that's what keeps people

6713.36 --> 6717.119
disciplined enough to survive

6721.119 --> 6725.04
it's something that

6722.639 --> 6726.0
the liberal media has been trying to

6725.04 --> 6727.76
like

6726.0 --> 6729.04
make us forget

6727.76 --> 6730.88
all that

6729.04 --> 6733.199
right anyway

6730.88 --> 6736.4800000000005
