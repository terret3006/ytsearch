82.259 --> 86.78
right so yeah the weather today is

87.36 --> 91.28
yeah there's a lot of rain

91.979 --> 96.53999999999999
it just stopped now but I mean it's

94.619 --> 99.42
raining hard

96.54 --> 102.619
it's a really big cloud flying over so I

99.42 --> 102.619
bet it's gonna happen again

103.38 --> 109.14
that cloud that's floating away there's

106.56 --> 112.38
a lot of rain came and looks like

109.14 --> 114.84
there's more coming

112.38 --> 118.579
so it's a very rainy day

114.84 --> 118.57900000000001
it's not super cold though

118.68 --> 123.84
doesn't really seem to matter how much

121.14 --> 127.2
it's clouded and raining it

123.84 --> 129.86
I think it's still like 22 degrees

127.2 --> 129.86
let's check it

131.52 --> 135.86
it's 20 degrees

133.379 --> 135.85999999999999
all right

136.02 --> 138.44
anyway

139.64 --> 144.54
hello Taylor Vision First in chat Guns

143.04 --> 148.56
of Navarone

144.54 --> 151.57999999999998
Robert B r p good to see you

148.56 --> 151.58
you're up early

152.22 --> 159.239
right it is Monday the 17th of July 2023

159.3 --> 162.62
audio problems

165.0 --> 169.4
well they're not registering on my side

172.48 --> 175.53
[Music]

184.5 --> 189.26
can only catch the first half hour oh

187.019 --> 189.26000000000002
okay

189.959 --> 193.879
well thanks for popping by Taylor vision

198.42 --> 204.439
hey Terra 306

201.31 --> 204.439
[Music]

208.2 --> 214.319
right

210.06 --> 218.0
yeah I feel better today I actually had

214.319 --> 218.0
a really decent dinner yesterday

218.099 --> 222.78
took me long enough I'm I'm finding that

220.799 --> 224.959
I'm having trouble eating in recent

222.78 --> 224.959
times

226.26 --> 231.959
I don't know exactly what it is

229.739 --> 233.76
it's just I think it might be just me

231.959 --> 236.58
stressing out

233.76 --> 238.79899999999998
over the state of my country

236.58 --> 241.35000000000002
well I'm so patriotic

238.799 --> 242.87900000000002
no but seriously like there's a lot of

241.35 --> 247.22
[Music]

242.879 --> 247.22
like very irritating things happening

254.879 --> 259.5
because

256.26 --> 262.86
yeah remember how our cabinet fell

259.5 --> 266.28
well I already had a suspicion that it

262.86 --> 268.86
would not be the end of it and it isn't

266.28 --> 271.75899999999996
he's basically the Prime Minister has

268.86 --> 271.759
basically tricked us

273.9 --> 277.56
and it's even the second time it

275.52 --> 280.919
happened there's elaborate videos about

277.56 --> 283.68
it in fully in Dutch

280.919 --> 286.34
but he basically like by throwing the

283.68 --> 286.34000000000003
cabinet out

286.979 --> 291.36
he sort of

288.419 --> 294.53999999999996
yeah because he's still there supposedly

291.36 --> 297.84000000000003
he's the missionary

294.54 --> 299.82
he's supposed to like still make things

297.84 --> 302.82
run until there's a new cabinet but if

299.82 --> 305.09999999999997
he can just hold it off a new cabinet

302.82 --> 307.32
from coming then he can technically

305.1 --> 308.24
have more power than even as a prime

307.32 --> 310.74
minister

308.24 --> 312.96000000000004
indefinitely and it seems like he's like

310.74 --> 316.199
openly planning that

312.96 --> 318.419
like he literally said that

316.199 --> 323.78000000000003
on television

318.419 --> 323.78
the guy is like a mad psychopath

324.12 --> 330.36
like this is getting

326.34 --> 332.34
to zelinski levels now with him it's

330.36 --> 333.96000000000004
really [ __ ] up

332.34 --> 336.61999999999995
and

333.96 --> 336.62
I'm

336.9 --> 343.039
my mind is not really in all that good a

339.66 --> 343.03900000000004
place because of this

343.68 --> 347.6
well Moxie Kevin k

349.68 --> 355.52
oh her headphones died all right that

352.979 --> 355.52
makes sense

362.6 --> 367.64000000000004
[Music]

371.58 --> 374.06
right

374.28 --> 378.84
and it's so [ __ ] up because I'm

376.139 --> 382.259
continually trying to correlate like

378.84 --> 385.79999999999995
what's happening now to my visions

382.259 --> 388.56
to match it and I'm finding that so many

385.8 --> 390.84000000000003
times that I had like

388.56 --> 394.56
Asians of what was about to happen and

390.84 --> 398.81899999999996
then when reality catches up on it it's

394.56 --> 403.34
like every time yeah that happened

398.819 --> 403.34000000000003
but there's so much like missing

403.919 --> 409.44
and so much information missing from the

406.74 --> 412.139
Visions every [ __ ] time it's really

409.44 --> 416.84
agitating and it is Cassandra I mean it

412.139 --> 416.84000000000003
is like it's probably on purpose

424.02 --> 426.96
you don't understand what's the

425.46 --> 428.46
difference between dark quote visions

426.96 --> 431.29999999999995
and Nightmares

428.46 --> 431.29999999999995
uh

431.58 --> 436.31899999999996
well

432.96 --> 439.62
the Sleep state of it because nightmares

436.319 --> 441.90000000000003
and regular dreams you're like you kinda

439.62 --> 444.66
know you're dreaming

441.9 --> 447.0
you might you're less conscious you you

444.66 --> 448.97900000000004
don't care as much

447.0 --> 451.8
you're just following your typical

448.979 --> 453.9
programming things but you don't really

451.8 --> 456.12
spend a lot of Consciousness on like

453.9 --> 459.78
where you are at and

456.12 --> 462.36
sizing things up and keeping track

459.78 --> 465.71999999999997
right that doesn't happen and that's how

462.36 --> 466.97900000000004
you then can find out like oh wait I'm

465.72 --> 469.02000000000004
dreaming

466.979 --> 471.24
the Dark World Vision is completely

469.02 --> 473.81899999999996
different because you do get all those

471.24 --> 475.979
elements and it is exactly like you're

473.819 --> 478.259
awake

475.979 --> 481.25899999999996
but there's more weird traits about it

478.259 --> 484.38
because it's like yeah you can basically

481.259 --> 488.28000000000003
move your arms through your own body

484.38 --> 490.259
is one of those things typical

488.28 --> 492.11999999999995
or that's one of the things that I had

490.259 --> 492.96000000000004
typically that things could move through

492.12 --> 494.639
me

492.96 --> 496.85999999999996
it's like things are trying to touch me

494.639 --> 500.16
and I can like see it as if it's

496.86 --> 503.94
touching me but I literally cannot feel

500.16 --> 507.96000000000004
it on that spot on my body right

503.94 --> 510.9
can feel other things there but not the

507.96 --> 512.8199999999999
touch of the skin that sort of thing so

510.9 --> 514.86
it's like it's just a completely

512.82 --> 518.0390000000001
different type of experience altogether

514.86 --> 520.62
than just dreaming

518.039 --> 522.24
yeah and nightmarish you wake up from

520.62 --> 525.6
nightmares

522.24 --> 528.66
usually in a very specific type of ways

525.6 --> 531.36
you wake up from nightmares

528.66 --> 533.6
the Dark World Vision nothing works like

531.36 --> 533.6
that

536.22 --> 543.6800000000001
anyway

538.68 --> 543.68
how do I train Derek dude

544.26 --> 549.899
this is all from the past

547.56 --> 553.0189999999999
and I wish it basically never had them

549.899 --> 555.18
it's I mean it must sound like really

553.019 --> 557.399
fascinating but it's literally all

555.18 --> 559.38
[ __ ] nightmares it was all [ __ ]

557.399 --> 563.519
nightmares man

559.38 --> 567.8389999999999
I'm talking about it to try to give it a

563.519 --> 572.54
place or something to try to resolve it

567.839 --> 577.0400000000001
or dissolve it perhaps neutralize it

572.54 --> 577.04
because it's been haunting me

577.08 --> 580.229
[Music]

581.16 --> 587.399
so you shouldn't train yourself

584.88 --> 589.98
does one have to be an oracle to enter

587.399 --> 592.82
them maybe

589.98 --> 592.82
I don't know

593.399 --> 600.66
the thing is is that

596.279 --> 602.8389999999999
I rolled into it with really [ __ ] up

600.66 --> 607.019
occult circles

602.839 --> 610.44
that literally tried to MK Ultra me

607.019 --> 615.0
in the process okay tarot you don't

610.44 --> 617.22
train yourself to do that yeah I didn't

615.0 --> 621.12
like oh cool we're gonna do something

617.22 --> 623.76
really unusual okay here's the books to

621.12 --> 625.62
study on exactly what the [ __ ] that is

623.76 --> 630.0
and what I should do and how I should

625.62 --> 634.519
prepare no I had no preparation whatso

630.0 --> 634.519
[ __ ] ever nothing yeah

636.36 --> 641.72
there is nothing you can do to train

639.3 --> 641.7199999999999
yourself

642.06 --> 646.5
why the [ __ ] would you want to do that

644.16 --> 649.16
why the [ __ ] you want to go to hell

646.5 --> 649.16
Tarot

651.0 --> 656.459
why the [ __ ] would you want Dark World

653.579 --> 659.279
Visions yeah my life is practically in

656.459 --> 661.14
shambles I don't really have much of a

659.279 --> 663.38
[ __ ] life why the hell would you want

661.14 --> 663.38
that

666.44 --> 670.2
okay

668.399 --> 672.779
yeah if you want to control your

670.2 --> 674.6400000000001
nightmares that's something else that is

672.779 --> 677.22
something that I could probably help you

674.64 --> 679.74
with yeah

677.22 --> 681.36
you don't learn to deal with your

679.74 --> 684.54
nightmares by

681.36 --> 686.5790000000001
basically going through what I did I

684.54 --> 689.579
learned to get control over my

686.579 --> 692.5999999999999
nightmares before

689.579 --> 692.5999999999999
all that happened

696.839 --> 702.6
it's just lucid dreaming like if you

700.44 --> 704.7
want some control over your dreams look

702.6 --> 707.519
into lucid dreaming there's people out

704.7 --> 710.279
there that are really focused on that

707.519 --> 713.4590000000001
and they know tricks on how to

710.279 --> 715.4399999999999
make yourself get more control or how to

713.459 --> 717.18
keep yourself in the dream and then have

715.44 --> 719.3000000000001
control over the dream all that sort of

717.18 --> 719.3
thing

721.68 --> 726.12
you always tune into mid deep

723.54 --> 728.54
conversation yeah you do more colored

726.12 --> 728.54
hello

745.56 --> 752.399
right so yeah to get a little sarcastic

750.0 --> 753.899
again back on what territory how do you

752.399 --> 756.6
train yourself to have Dark Wolf where

753.899 --> 759.839
you don't train yourself to have them

756.6 --> 762.72
but yeah like with all things

759.839 --> 766.019
doing things consciously

762.72 --> 769.82
is training and you become better at it

766.019 --> 771.899
and at the end of the ride I pretty much

769.82 --> 774.36
mastered it

771.899 --> 776.76
thing is I'll probably never be able to

774.36 --> 778.86
do it again that's one of the things

776.76 --> 782.279
this is I don't know if I've ever told

778.86 --> 784.6800000000001
anybody but at the end of all of this

782.279 --> 786.899
last time I met the man in Black he

784.68 --> 790.399
literally told me this is the last time

786.899 --> 790.399
you're going to experience it

791.399 --> 797.279
and that was

794.279 --> 797.279
2013.

801.72 --> 807.62
and I haven't since I haven't had that

804.839 --> 807.62
effect since

811.44 --> 814.98
I haven't met it since I haven't gone

813.24 --> 816.9590000000001
back to the Dark World since I'm very

814.98 --> 819.66
happy about that because

816.959 --> 822.42
in all that time that I actually spent

819.66 --> 824.7199999999999
with my Consciousness in there yeah I

822.42 --> 827.76
learned more about it but it's like

824.72 --> 830.339
every little [ __ ] detail that I

827.76 --> 833.579
learned you could say had like a massive

830.339 --> 835.86
burden with it so it's like I have like

833.579 --> 838.9799999999999
debt now

835.86 --> 842.76
not literally like that but

838.98 --> 844.9200000000001
like it's it's not [ __ ] worth it it's

842.76 --> 847.8
not worth it

844.92 --> 850.019
yeah that's my [ __ ] conclusion it's

847.8 --> 852.3
not [ __ ] worth it don't [ __ ] do

850.019 --> 854.639
what I do I've said it four years ago

852.3 --> 859.62
five years ago and I really mean it

854.639 --> 862.62
don't [ __ ] do it get a life get a

859.62 --> 865.5600000000001
life don't do what I did

862.62 --> 869.1
get a life

865.56 --> 871.8599999999999
focus on life on Earth

869.1 --> 873.48
on a family on a girlfriend on how to

871.86 --> 876.0600000000001
deal with that and how to protect your

873.48 --> 879.24
children focus on that [ __ ] man don't

876.06 --> 882.56
[ __ ] get into what I did it literally

879.24 --> 882.5600000000001
wrecks your life

888.3 --> 894.3599999999999
I'm just telling it's like a wharf it to

891.66 --> 896.36
me it's like a [ __ ] War Story yeah

894.36 --> 899.4590000000001
when you hear a war story you know

896.36 --> 903.12
terrible experience you want oh I do I

899.459 --> 903.1199999999999
want to do that no

906.66 --> 912.0
okay anyway I'll just move on you

909.959 --> 915.18
probably didn't even mean that

912.0 --> 919.639
is like that it's just that freaking

915.18 --> 919.6389999999999
Dark World Visions are [ __ ] haunting

920.1 --> 925.8000000000001
and it's like I'm used to it now so that

923.16 --> 926.88
it doesn't like actually induce fear in

925.8 --> 929.459
me

926.88 --> 932.3389999999999
anymore like it did when it really first

929.459 --> 935.16
started to pop back up in 2015 and

932.339 --> 938.8800000000001
started to regain memories of it was

935.16 --> 941.579
literally terrifying like every [ __ ]

938.88 --> 944.76
time terrified yeah very mysterious and

941.579 --> 948.42
wonders but also very much terrifying

944.76 --> 949.74
like that layer of like it's all it's

948.42 --> 952.459
all bad

949.74 --> 952.4590000000001
do it

952.68 --> 957.959
like the demons are just like alluring

955.98 --> 960.32
like oh will we take more will he dive

957.959 --> 963.66
deeper yes

960.32 --> 965.5790000000001
come here oh this is the real thing this

963.66 --> 967.68
is what you should focus on no no

965.579 --> 970.62
and I have been even advised the latest

967.68 --> 973.519
basically like lay it to rest don't even

970.62 --> 973.519
talk about it

973.62 --> 978.72
thing is there's so many fascinating

975.72 --> 980.82
aspects about it and I don't just want

978.72 --> 985.62
to have gone through that enormous

980.82 --> 989.839
length of hell time and then have

985.62 --> 989.839
absolutely nothing out of it

991.019 --> 995.54
I don't want it all to just be for

993.3 --> 995.54
nothing

999.54 --> 1006.639
even though it was completely idiotic

1002.18 --> 1006.6389999999999
the way I I got into this

1019.899 --> 1026.419
flashes right Rich G yeah

1023.48 --> 1028.4
now flashes is like

1026.419 --> 1030.38
that's like

1028.4 --> 1032.6000000000001
lucid dreaming

1030.38 --> 1035.48
that's very typical

1032.6 --> 1037.819
lucid dreaming is very adjacent to Dark

1035.48 --> 1040.16
World Vision except that

1037.819 --> 1041.959
now imagine lucid dreaming but without

1040.16 --> 1045.14
all the light and all the good feelings

1041.959 --> 1046.4
those go away and you can't snap out of

1045.14 --> 1051.16
it

1046.4 --> 1051.16
and then [ __ ] entities come come over

1051.32 --> 1058.84
start to interact with you try to get

1054.26 --> 1058.84
things from you get you to do things

1059.54 --> 1068.48
[Music]

1066.5 --> 1069.74
you do it a lot though yeah well I bet

1068.48 --> 1072.98
you do

1069.74 --> 1076.4
a lot of the people that have that

1072.98 --> 1079.299
are drawn to me and my stories

1076.4 --> 1079.299
what I talk about

1079.52 --> 1084.74
so most people in here that are regular

1082.1 --> 1088.24
visitors they do have like strong pineal

1084.74 --> 1088.24
glands and they will have

1088.4 --> 1093.0800000000002
like

1089.559 --> 1095.539
foresight visions

1093.08 --> 1097.22
or lucid dreaming on a more regular

1095.539 --> 1101.44
basis than average

1097.22 --> 1101.44
most of you here have that

1113.059 --> 1118.22
wow okay that's messed up our color

1116.78 --> 1120.62
although

1118.22 --> 1123.26
you haven't had

1120.62 --> 1125.86
methadone Addiction in the past not

1123.26 --> 1125.86
surprising

1130.34 --> 1134.8999999999999
because yeah

1132.5 --> 1137.179
it enhances the nightmares and that

1134.9 --> 1139.7
might be a lasting effect

1137.179 --> 1143.179
like I don't really have like terrifying

1139.7 --> 1145.88
night terrors where I'm like ah

1143.179 --> 1150.14
and the weird thing is is that

1145.88 --> 1153.0200000000002
they still do sort a trigger except

1150.14 --> 1154.88
I don't know how I've got like they

1153.02 --> 1157.52
can't get to me

1154.88 --> 1158.96
like they'll still scare me but they

1157.52 --> 1161.36
won't like

1158.96 --> 1164.1200000000001
connect up so that it's like really

1161.36 --> 1166.76
visceral to me

1164.12 --> 1168.6789999999999
maybe it is also a side effect from

1166.76 --> 1171.559
going through the Dark World for so long

1168.679 --> 1174.26
that's that it's just physically doesn't

1171.559 --> 1175.22
really have an effect on me anymore too

1174.26 --> 1179.32
much

1175.22 --> 1179.32
so even if I have nightmares it's like

1179.48 --> 1183.5
like I just it's too easy for me to

1181.94 --> 1186.02
become conscious that it's a dream it's

1183.5 --> 1187.94
like oh no there's a devil murdering me

1186.02 --> 1190.22
or something or I'm getting sacrificed

1187.94 --> 1193.0
on alternates like yeah yeah yeah I know

1190.22 --> 1193.0
this isn't real

1193.22 --> 1196.22
mm-hmm

1197.72 --> 1202.4
but it's oh but it's so scary yeah but I

1200.78 --> 1204.5
know it's not real

1202.4 --> 1206.539
and this is never gonna happen

1204.5 --> 1208.94
I would never get to the point where

1206.539 --> 1211.16
this could happen

1208.94 --> 1212.299
because I'd probably end up dead before

1211.16 --> 1216.16
that

1212.299 --> 1216.16
like trying to kill you

1216.2 --> 1219.2
uh

1225.62 --> 1228.6399999999999
wow okay

1244.7 --> 1248.419
yeah

1246.08 --> 1252.1599999999999
typical Market yeah that's an That's a

1248.419 --> 1252.16
classic isolation

1265.34 --> 1270.9189999999999
I mean that's like it's literally like

1268.16 --> 1275.0400000000002
ah demons playing with cutting off your

1270.919 --> 1277.4
senses it's classic isolation

1275.04 --> 1278.6
[Music]

1277.4 --> 1281.419
foreign

1278.6 --> 1283.6399999999999
you can actually overcome such dreams if

1281.419 --> 1285.88
you had it again and you'd be aware of

1283.64 --> 1285.88
this

1285.919 --> 1290.74
you could literally use that moment to

1288.44 --> 1293.6000000000001
basically just

1290.74 --> 1296.0
reroute your thinking of the situation

1293.6 --> 1297.62
as if you were like in an isolation tank

1296.0 --> 1300.26
right where you're like floating in

1297.62 --> 1302.84
salty water in absolute silence

1300.26 --> 1305.299
you could literally make that out of it

1302.84 --> 1307.82
like re-imagine

1305.299 --> 1310.52
what's happening around you

1307.82 --> 1312.5
you could attempt that if it ever comes

1310.52 --> 1314.78
back

1312.5 --> 1316.7
right it's like no I'm embracing the

1314.78 --> 1319.82
science

1316.7 --> 1322.94
and I'm embracing the isolation

1319.82 --> 1327.4399999999998
I'm not letting it make me believe like

1322.94 --> 1330.26
it's permanent and or that and

1327.44 --> 1332.9
yeah you just you can't regain control

1330.26 --> 1334.94
you can reimagine

1332.9 --> 1337.76
what it is and that might even like

1334.94 --> 1339.44
transform visually around you what

1337.76 --> 1343.1
you're in and you could be like I'm

1339.44 --> 1344.6000000000001
stuck in a coffin to like no wait I'm in

1343.1 --> 1346.6399999999999
an isolation tank and guess what

1344.6 --> 1348.74
suddenly you're floating in an isolation

1346.64 --> 1353.3200000000002
tank

1348.74 --> 1353.32
because you reimagined the situation

1353.419 --> 1355.96
right

1356.6 --> 1361.82
have you ever tried such thing

1359.659 --> 1364.64
I do that all the time

1361.82 --> 1366.74
it works really well it's like because

1364.64 --> 1370.4
you just have to realize that in a dream

1366.74 --> 1372.799
or in the dark world it's a Holodeck

1370.4 --> 1375.8600000000001
you it's literally a Holodeck that's

1372.799 --> 1379.1589999999999
projected by your freaking mind

1375.86 --> 1382.1589999999999
you can reimagine it and it's not like

1379.159 --> 1384.0200000000002
oh how do I rearrange this thing that's

1382.159 --> 1386.419
secondary because it's a projection no

1384.02 --> 1389.4189999999999
you just think of it differently

1386.419 --> 1389.419
reimagine

1393.14 --> 1399.98
right but with reimagining does come

1396.62 --> 1401.36
letting go of bracing it only works when

1399.98 --> 1403.34
you let go

1401.36 --> 1407.24
and that could be

1403.34 --> 1408.86
giving in to a virtual thread of

1407.24 --> 1411.6200000000001
imminent death

1408.86 --> 1413.539
so it's very handy to actually be aware

1411.62 --> 1416.539
it's a dream and that no physical

1413.539 --> 1419.6589999999999
permanent harm can over can help come to

1416.539 --> 1421.76
you there and then you can let it go and

1419.659 --> 1424.659
then you either wake up or you start

1421.76 --> 1424.6589999999999
reimagining

1434.059 --> 1438.44
fight or flight yeah well if you yeah if

1436.7 --> 1440.3600000000001
you're gonna literally panic in your

1438.44 --> 1442.28
dream then you lose control like once

1440.36 --> 1445.1
you panic you can't do all those things

1442.28 --> 1446.12
anymore what I just described yeah that

1445.1 --> 1448.9399999999998
sucks

1446.12 --> 1451.1789999999999
the trick is to never let it get to that

1448.94 --> 1451.179
point

1461.659 --> 1466.419
oh you were frozen huh

1464.299 --> 1466.4189999999999
um

1476.9 --> 1481.3400000000001
yeah

1478.7 --> 1484.059
might have been a sleep paralysis Factor

1481.34 --> 1484.059
added to it

1485.48 --> 1490.22
well that's pretty mess usually sleep

1487.46 --> 1492.6200000000001
paralysis is like a waking

1490.22 --> 1494.48
it's like you wake up and then you can't

1492.62 --> 1496.1
move

1494.48 --> 1498.6200000000001
bye

1496.1 --> 1502.48
if you then stay in the dream then

1498.62 --> 1502.4799999999998
you're paralyzed in your dream

1504.5 --> 1507.82
but it's probably rooted in the same

1506.48 --> 1509.799
effect

1507.82 --> 1512.299
[Music]

1509.799 --> 1514.039
suppresses dreams from my experience no

1512.299 --> 1518.72
well I don't seem to have the issue I

1514.039 --> 1518.72
had a huge dream last night huge

1522.26 --> 1526.48
it was very visual

1528.5 --> 1535.1
might have something to do with the

1530.72 --> 1535.1000000000001
movie I watched yesterday oof

1535.82 --> 1542.539
oh man I watched a movie that was like

1538.7 --> 1543.94
really intense it was another Spanish

1542.539 --> 1547.34
like

1543.94 --> 1549.74
Satanism themed thing and not like

1547.34 --> 1553.1
modern garbage Hollywood crap or

1549.74 --> 1556.039
Satanism but like old style like kind of

1553.1 --> 1558.32
like Cthulhu but there's movies about

1556.039 --> 1559.82
there's there are multiple of these

1558.32 --> 1562.4189999999999
types of moves I find them very

1559.82 --> 1562.4189999999999
fascinating

1562.88 --> 1568.94
and they're all Spanish but they're

1565.94 --> 1571.22
pretty good this one was also very

1568.94 --> 1573.26
interesting in many ways

1571.22 --> 1575.779
it was like

1573.26 --> 1578.6
it was like really dark

1575.779 --> 1582.4
but it was even more suggestive dark

1578.6 --> 1582.3999999999999
than it was actually dark

1583.58 --> 1589.72
and that's interesting

1585.38 --> 1589.72
but uh what was it called again uh

1591.98 --> 1594.58
damn it

1598.22 --> 1601.779
oh yeah Elementary

1602.62 --> 1608.26
it's like Elementary Watson what you say

1606.08 --> 1611.72
it in Chinese Elementary

1608.26 --> 1615.14
I don't know but it's about it's like

1611.72 --> 1617.059
about this blacksmith that was more that

1615.14 --> 1621.5800000000002
was like

1617.059 --> 1621.58
more evil than the devil

1624.799 --> 1630.26
but it it didn't really seem like it was

1627.62 --> 1631.52
really it was a tragedy story about

1630.26 --> 1634.1
yeah

1631.52 --> 1635.84
a guy that basically went crazy

1634.1 --> 1638.6589999999999
and he made a deal with the devil and

1635.84 --> 1641.84
there's like literally a demon like in

1638.659 --> 1645.3200000000002
the flesh they keep it in a cage

1641.84 --> 1648.74
and it's pretty well played out and then

1645.32 --> 1650.84
later in like the the last part like

1648.74 --> 1652.1
they literally go to the gates of hell

1650.84 --> 1653.36
and that

1652.1 --> 1656.539
it's

1653.36 --> 1659.84
It's relatively basic

1656.539 --> 1662.539
it's not like ooh CDI spectacle Overkill

1659.84 --> 1663.86
no but it's like pretty simple but

1662.539 --> 1667.4
really

1663.86 --> 1669.02
it's very intimidating I mean that I

1667.4 --> 1671.38
thought it was pretty intimidating in

1669.02 --> 1671.3799999999999
ways

1671.48 --> 1676.52
and

1673.659 --> 1678.2
fascinating ahead of really fascinating

1676.52 --> 1681.32
way it ended

1678.2 --> 1684.26
because it's basically like yeah spoiler

1681.32 --> 1687.5
alert sorry but it's basically the yeah

1684.26 --> 1690.08
the blacksmith like goes and finds in

1687.5 --> 1693.74
Hell goes to hell he literally

1690.08 --> 1696.1999999999998
gives up his life to rescue a girl that

1693.74 --> 1697.64
just sold her soul to the devil just

1696.2 --> 1699.6200000000001
because she wanted to find her mother

1697.64 --> 1701.659
because everybody bullies her all the

1699.62 --> 1703.9399999999998
time it's really [ __ ] up

1701.659 --> 1707.8400000000001
it's it's pretty dark the whole story

1703.94 --> 1711.02
thing but then he basically like gives

1707.84 --> 1712.8799999999999
in from having fought off the contract

1711.02 --> 1715.46
with the devil basically says no no take

1712.88 --> 1717.919
me to hell I need to rescue her which is

1715.46 --> 1720.38
like super heroic

1717.919 --> 1722.539
like underneath the dark it's all very

1720.38 --> 1725.2990000000002
fascinating how they

1722.539 --> 1727.82
oh they made it and it ends up like he

1725.299 --> 1729.9189999999999
basically goes through the hates a Gates

1727.82 --> 1733.279
of Hell with a big hammer like as an

1729.919 --> 1734.6000000000001
offensive like I'm I'm gonna find her

1733.279 --> 1738.88
mother

1734.6 --> 1738.8799999999999
that's where the story it's fascinating

1741.32 --> 1745.3999999999999
right so that was on Netflix very

1743.48 --> 1747.14
unexpected

1745.4 --> 1748.94
good

1747.14 --> 1751.48
dark

1748.94 --> 1754.94
but like

1751.48 --> 1757.64
real serious on the myth of it really

1754.94 --> 1761.179
really serious I liked it it was it is

1757.64 --> 1763.8200000000002
very like Catholic though it's it is

1761.179 --> 1766.159
about that too it's a it's like even

1763.82 --> 1768.74
like no

1766.159 --> 1772.1000000000001
you made up the devil like you made up

1768.74 --> 1774.6200000000001
hell it is about it's like part of the

1772.1 --> 1776.48
theme of it you get an intro story and

1774.62 --> 1780.1999999999998
it's about that

1776.48 --> 1784.22
very fascinating movie guys so in this

1780.2 --> 1787.5800000000002
case I will recommend you watch that

1784.22 --> 1789.559
it's not Ultra gory or anything I mean

1787.58 --> 1791.539
the movie from yesterday is more gory

1789.559 --> 1794.08
than this one

1791.539 --> 1794.08
foreign

1812.899 --> 1816.82
let me see if I can get the full name

1819.39 --> 1822.479
[Music]

1830.96 --> 1835.8990000000001
yeah Elementary the blacksmith and the

1833.6 --> 1835.899
devil

1836.899 --> 1841.1589999999999
that's what it's called

1838.52 --> 1842.899
and it is Spanish spoken and I would

1841.159 --> 1845.3600000000001
watch it like that I don't think there's

1842.899 --> 1846.799
like other

1845.36 --> 1849.559
speaker over

1846.799 --> 1854.2
it's all in Spanish Spanish actors they

1849.559 --> 1854.2
do a really good job at it I felt

1855.039 --> 1859.399
it really does feel like Spain in like

1858.02 --> 1863.559
that era

1859.399 --> 1863.559
it's like in the 1800s

1867.679 --> 1873.3200000000002
absolutely do not mind for yeah me me

1870.2 --> 1875.72
too if they're good they're some of them

1873.32 --> 1878.24
just suck especially if they're in the

1875.72 --> 1883.179
modern times most kind of suck

1878.24 --> 1883.179
but these like historical type things

1883.64 --> 1889.3400000000001
they're often very awesome

1886.46 --> 1891.679
because they're not like hollywooded as

1889.34 --> 1895.4189999999999
much they're like another four this is

1891.679 --> 1895.419
just another type of Storytelling

1898.159 --> 1903.38
yeah that was the way of the serpent

1901.52 --> 1905.4189999999999
that was a movie from yesterday and that

1903.38 --> 1908.659
was Swedish

1905.419 --> 1910.88
there's a Swedish Medieval Times

1908.659 --> 1913.5200000000002
post medieval times but it's still kind

1910.88 --> 1916.64
of medieval-ish it was also interesting

1913.52 --> 1919.72
enough a lot about the 18th and 19th

1916.64 --> 1919.72
century recently

1922.71 --> 1925.979
[Music]

1930.64 --> 1937.94
Chinese Sherlock Elementary my dear

1934.52 --> 1937.94
Watson yep

1938.059 --> 1942.44
foreign

1939.44 --> 1942.44
mentary

1944.659 --> 1949.46
and I immediately imagine oh Benjamin

1947.059 --> 1951.8799999999999
doing a China oh Elementary yeah

1949.46 --> 1951.88
Washington

1952.76 --> 1955.299
uh

1974.96 --> 1980.24
yeah exactly Mark Allard and these

1977.659 --> 1982.279
actors like they get they really get

1980.24 --> 1986.059
into it

1982.279 --> 1989.36
and it's like their anguish acting also

1986.059 --> 1991.279
is very like very visceral and realistic

1989.36 --> 1994.58
I mean it's very the

1991.279 --> 1997.46
it's very convincing and which is weird

1994.58 --> 2000.279
because I mean there's a literal devil

1997.46 --> 2001.8990000000001
in it in a cage and it's like that makes

2000.279 --> 2003.82
it like what

2001.899 --> 2006.2199999999998
but they still make it they make

2003.82 --> 2007.74
people's like respond like what what the

2006.22 --> 2010.679
[ __ ] is that

2007.74 --> 2013.48
like what is that

2010.679 --> 2015.539
they make it very convincing like how

2013.48 --> 2019.0
these people are all

2015.539 --> 2021.039
[ __ ] their pants sometimes and

2019.0 --> 2022.6
and still trying to do the right thing

2021.039 --> 2025.419
and

2022.6 --> 2027.84
it's interesting and it just the acting

2025.419 --> 2027.8400000000001
was good

2037.96 --> 2040.44
right

2041.14 --> 2046.8600000000001
right

2042.7 --> 2046.8600000000001
rare exports no

2047.559 --> 2050.46
never heard of that

2059.619 --> 2064.78
oh

2061.26 --> 2067.8590000000004
you had to pull out the wieners

2064.78 --> 2067.8590000000004
oh goody

2070.419 --> 2076.919
yeah there's no wieners in this movie

2073.179 --> 2076.919
guys there's no wieners

2079.3 --> 2085.98
there's little children in it and no

2082.3 --> 2085.98
wieners so it's all good

2090.7 --> 2096.04
although like they do slap the children

2093.76 --> 2100.9
but I mean yeah come on

2096.04 --> 2102.46
freaking speaking in the 18th century

2100.9 --> 2105.9
uh

2102.46 --> 2105.9
that's always good I know

2113.56 --> 2117.42
it's about Krampus okay

2120.22 --> 2127.56
it's taken for Santa that's hilarious

2124.48 --> 2127.56
sounds interesting

2132.88 --> 2137.88
I might check it out I take it it's not

2135.46 --> 2137.88
on Netflix

2138.16 --> 2144.2999999999997
I might have seen it actually but if I

2141.339 --> 2144.2999999999997
have I've forgotten

2157.5 --> 2160.8
all right

2163.78 --> 2170.7000000000003
it is on 2B

2166.0 --> 2170.7
yeah I don't care I don't do that

2170.98 --> 2174.42

2175.18 --> 2179.859
A Christmas Tale okay you didn't say

2177.94 --> 2182.38
that part

2179.859 --> 2185.7
uh

2182.38 --> 2185.7000000000003
oh there's plenty of that

2188.32 --> 2192.839
doesn't really look like a very popular

2190.359 --> 2192.839
movie

2207.64 --> 2213.06
let's see if this works what the hell

2210.339 --> 2213.06
[ __ ] off

2215.98 --> 2218.82
uh

2219.339 --> 2227.04

[ __ ] pop-up [ __ ] piss up piss off

2229.3 --> 2235.32
holy [ __ ] that's new

2232.599 --> 2235.32
uh

2245.02 --> 2252.359
okay well let's see if this downloads

2248.32 --> 2252.3590000000004
you did not have a lot of seeds

2256.78 --> 2259.5
hmm

2260.5 --> 2263.52
we'll see

2265.39 --> 2272.4
[Music]

2267.099 --> 2272.4
yeah I don't know I'm not doing it

2274.54 --> 2280.18
I'm not gonna use any online watching

2277.66 --> 2283.24
sites I don't do it I don't trust them

2280.18 --> 2285.91
they're [ __ ] dangerous yeah you do

2283.24 --> 2288.52
the wrong thing your computer is [ __ ]

2285.91 --> 2291.96
[Music]

2288.52 --> 2291.96
I'm not doing it

2294.339 --> 2298.859
it might work for you I'm not risking

2296.68 --> 2298.859
that

2302.23 --> 2305.309
[Music]

2308.26 --> 2313.6600000000003
I'm just gonna download it from Pirate

2310.839 --> 2317.22
Bay as usual

2313.66 --> 2317.22
it's much safer that way

2317.859 --> 2323.339
ah it is actually downloading awesome oh

2320.5 --> 2323.339
very quick too

2323.56 --> 2325.74
thank you

2325.78 --> 2332.5
well I'm downloading it 2.4 megabytes

2329.98 --> 2334.119
from one seed

2332.5 --> 2338.579
damn

2334.119 --> 2338.579
that guy's got a serious upload speed

2345.04 --> 2350.98
note yeah right

2348.099 --> 2355.02
oh it's not oh yeah that makes it even

2350.98 --> 2355.02
more suspect more colored

2360.52 --> 2366.24
yeah owned by Walmart

2362.98 --> 2366.2400000000002
so by China

2367.359 --> 2373.42
and I mean you could definitely trust

2370.119 --> 2377.76
Chinese software right

2373.42 --> 2382.0
it's not like oh we Chinese we give you

2377.76 --> 2384.9
nice free streaming oh yeah very

2382.0 --> 2384.9
trustworthy

2386.14 --> 2389.04
no thanks

2393.22 --> 2397.839
without Chinese code using a computer

2396.04 --> 2399.82
without what the [ __ ] are you talking

2397.839 --> 2404.64
about

2399.82 --> 2404.6400000000003
now I just I'm not doing it

2414.099 --> 2419.6800000000003
I just download my stuff it's perfectly

2417.22 --> 2422.4399999999996
safe I have it on my computer which

2419.68 --> 2424.359
means that in 10 years I can flick

2422.44 --> 2425.68
through it and like hey what's this I

2424.359 --> 2428.74
don't remember this

2425.68 --> 2430.359
oh yeah let's see that again

2428.74 --> 2433.2999999999997
yeah

2430.359 --> 2435.94
like that much better

2433.3 --> 2438.46
I like to collect good movies because I

2435.94 --> 2441.04
forget about them

2438.46 --> 2442.96
and it's not like oh it's on Netflix oh

2441.04 --> 2445.06
that means it's always going to re-pop

2442.96 --> 2448.359
up every now and then

2445.06 --> 2451.839
no you'll just forget about it

2448.359 --> 2454.9
I like to have it on my computer

2451.839 --> 2458.0789999999997
my database isn't even that huge it's

2454.9 --> 2462.2200000000003
all still fill like

2458.079 --> 2464.98
fits very easily on a hard disk

2462.22 --> 2466.359
it's not even a quarter full

2464.98 --> 2468.839
with it

2466.359 --> 2468.839
so

2475.18 --> 2479.9199999999996
download it yeah yeah okay fair enough I

2477.88 --> 2481.42
mean if you guys are like on mobiles and

2479.92 --> 2483.46
all that and

2481.42 --> 2485.6800000000003
I'm just saying like I'm not doing that

2483.46 --> 2490.5
I don't trust

2485.68 --> 2490.5
like free download sites like that

2494.44 --> 2499.48
or what is it a free streaming

2509.38 --> 2514.2400000000002
I had it before that I tried that out

2511.66 --> 2516.64
and it would literally just give me like

2514.24 --> 2518.859
an endless pop-up cycle I had to like

2516.64 --> 2520.359
reset my computer because I couldn't get

2518.859 --> 2524.7
out of it

2520.359 --> 2524.7
like I'm not doing that [ __ ] again dude

2525.16 --> 2527.8199999999997
uh

2543.46 --> 2546.69
[Music]

2554.32 --> 2558.599
end up having to fix their mistakes yeah

2559.0 --> 2561.839
foreign

2574.38 --> 2579.359
stick okay that's a really big stick

2577.0 --> 2579.359
then

2581.02 --> 2587.92
right and make sure to have a copy

2583.24 --> 2591.0299999999997
though of that [ __ ] you need a backup

2587.92 --> 2591.03
[Music]

2601.119 --> 2607.7400000000002
and I'm switching them oh okay well

2603.7 --> 2607.74
that's cool if you yeah

2610.3 --> 2613.599
yeah okay I'm switching to Linux helps

2612.76 --> 2615.8190000000004
that

2613.599 --> 2618.2200000000003
that's great

2615.819 --> 2620.7599999999998
glad everybody was okay with that

2618.22 --> 2620.7599999999998
transition

2631.54 --> 2638.02
yeah

2634.18 --> 2642.1189999999997
whoa the download's already almost ready

2638.02 --> 2642.119
let's get that thing is going so fast

2643.78 --> 2649.5600000000004
oh wait no it stopped that's not good

2654.4 --> 2660.119
why didn't just stop

2656.859 --> 2660.119
it's like a two-thirds

2662.26 --> 2667.599
damn it

2664.839 --> 2669.88
anyway I'll I'll try to find a version

2667.599 --> 2673.1400000000003
later

2669.88 --> 2673.1400000000003
rare exports

2674.44 --> 2678.28
anyway

2676.119 --> 2681.54
right so you haven't heard anything of

2678.28 --> 2681.5400000000004
Nathan yet by the way

2682.359 --> 2687.0
really hope there's going to be an fvd

2684.46 --> 2687.0
live today

2690.22 --> 2694.649
[Music]

2713.76 --> 2720.4
okay Morgan yeah no but to be fair I've

2717.28 --> 2722.5
actually been considering Linux for for

2720.4 --> 2725.319
a while it's just I never got to it it's

2722.5 --> 2727.119
like I'm still using this and it's

2725.319 --> 2729.52
working

2727.119 --> 2732.28
I mean I I technically don't have

2729.52 --> 2734.74
problems it's not like oh

2732.28 --> 2737.3190000000004
yeah there's a certain thing about it

2734.74 --> 2740.0789999999997
that I can't fix and it's just

2737.319 --> 2743.2
it's getting worse no no it's fine it

2740.079 --> 2744.4
has been fine exactly like this

2743.2 --> 2747.819
and

2744.4 --> 2749.56
I just don't have a direct reason

2747.819 --> 2752.4
to switch

2749.56 --> 2752.4
to Linux

2752.68 --> 2759.1189999999997
but it's it is like in the long term

2755.02 --> 2759.119
planning though as an option

2759.7 --> 2763.72
and also I've been just waiting and

2761.74 --> 2765.22
waiting and waiting for it to get better

2763.72 --> 2769.2999999999997
and

2765.22 --> 2771.819
more software to be adapted to it

2769.3 --> 2775.38
so I guess that at this point it's just

2771.819 --> 2775.38
it's fully matured

2787.359 --> 2792.66
okay

2788.7 --> 2792.66
it's not about the code

2793.9 --> 2799.9
it's not about yeah I know like half the

2797.14 --> 2802.839
things or maybe all of them that are in

2799.9 --> 2804.46
my computer are fabricated in China yeah

2802.839 --> 2806.68
I realize that's not what I'm talking

2804.46 --> 2809.619
about

2806.68 --> 2811.72
when I mentioned like like Walmart

2809.619 --> 2814.599
streaming sites

2811.72 --> 2816.7799999999997
it's about them just feeding you for

2814.599 --> 2816.78
free

2817.48 --> 2821.099
like I don't trust that

2821.319 --> 2824.88
you shouldn't trust that either

2832.06 --> 2837.359
you do realize that like Walmart like

2834.579 --> 2837.3590000000004
ruined

2837.4 --> 2841.54
like almost all mom and pop stores in

2840.16 --> 2845.0989999999997
the United States

2841.54 --> 2845.099
you do realize that right

2870.28 --> 2875.26
anyway I'll stop pestering you about it

2872.98 --> 2877.8
you want to do that fine you go find

2875.26 --> 2881.26
your free streams

2877.8 --> 2884.44
Walmart and wherever

2881.26 --> 2886.0
I mean it's all gonna lead to [ __ ] in in

2884.44 --> 2888.579
the end they're all gonna censor [ __ ]

2886.0 --> 2893.22
they're all gonna push [ __ ] in your face

2888.579 --> 2893.2200000000003
if you don't want to see they always do

2898.54 --> 2901.72
but then again I mean Netflix does that

2900.76 --> 2905.3390000000004
too

2901.72 --> 2905.339
and that is paid

2905.579 --> 2911.5600000000004
I'll stop complaining about that fine

2908.319 --> 2913.68
you use that I downloaded from Pirate

2911.56 --> 2913.68
Bay

2926.02 --> 2931.38
although this particular download seems

2928.839 --> 2931.38
to be broken

2935.079 --> 2940.079
try another one

2937.42 --> 2940.079
foreign

2988.2 --> 2994.56
let's see if this one will work

2992.02 --> 2994.56
right

2995.619 --> 3001.04
so guys

2997.599 --> 3001.04
in the first hour

3020.46 --> 3025.52
I reviewed a movie

3022.68 --> 3025.52
for a bit

3028.74 --> 3032.359
talked about Vision stuff

3033.26 --> 3036.7400000000002
and dreams

3042.58 --> 3050.23
[Music]

3054.78 --> 3059.52
I'm definitely gonna steal that thing

3057.0 --> 3062.16
yeah even though I made it up

3059.52 --> 3064.819
Elementary my dear Watson because I was

3062.16 --> 3064.819
the one that

3065.819 --> 3071.7799999999997
The Slow Mo un buggy said it though

3068.099 --> 3071.78
and now it's the title of the show

3081.0 --> 3086.099
it's kind of funny too because Owen

3083.46 --> 3088.8
Benjamin Had A [ __ ] home show that

3086.099 --> 3092.6600000000003
was his last show it was [ __ ] homes

3088.8 --> 3092.6600000000003
scene so it all comes together

3093.92 --> 3099.11
this is

3095.91 --> 3099.1099999999997
[Music]

3103.319 --> 3108.079
all synchronicities all over the place

3114.51 --> 3118.179
[Music]

3137.16 --> 3144.0589999999997
[Music]

3140.22 --> 3147.0
right any feedback on yesterday's show

3144.059 --> 3149.28
before or anything and the chat's a

3147.0 --> 3152.3
little uh slow today

3149.28 --> 3152.3
or it is right now

3195.54 --> 3201.24
I'm gonna talk about that okay uh

3205.2 --> 3210.18
oh apparently the climate cult in the

3208.26 --> 3211.7400000000002
Netherlands has gone to like serious

3210.18 --> 3213.359
cold status

3211.74 --> 3216.5989999999997
because now

3213.359 --> 3218.0989999999997
like on the news the actual news

3216.599 --> 3221.28
websites

3218.099 --> 3222.059
they have like a literal box that tells

3221.28 --> 3225.6800000000003
you

3222.059 --> 3228.9
you're you cannot say

3225.68 --> 3231.54
that you cannot talk about any kind of

3228.9 --> 3234.119
denial about the influence of Humanity

3231.54 --> 3235.859
on climate change seriously they have it

3234.119 --> 3239.46
in a box

3235.859 --> 3241.38
like in the chat there in the comment

3239.46 --> 3245.16
section it's so [ __ ] up they're

3241.38 --> 3246.839
literally cultists now

3245.16 --> 3249.6189999999997
so I'm like yeah what are we gonna do

3246.839 --> 3249.619
about this cult

3253.559 --> 3259.3190000000004
what are you gonna do about a cult that

3255.96 --> 3261.359
insists that is basically has set their

3259.319 --> 3264.5589999999997
sights on the extermination of mankind

3261.359 --> 3264.5589999999997
what do you do about that

3265.079 --> 3269.0
what do you do about those people

3271.44 --> 3276.839
how do you get them out other than by

3274.859 --> 3279.2999999999997
declaring them incompetent which they

3276.839 --> 3283.5
are if you're a climate cultist then you

3279.3 --> 3286.6800000000003
are incompetent and not only that you're

3283.5 --> 3288.42
at utterly untrustworthy

3286.68 --> 3291.7799999999997
because

3288.42 --> 3294.319
your cult is literally about destroying

3291.78 --> 3294.3190000000004
Humanity

3296.819 --> 3302.54
what

3299.099 --> 3302.54
oh damn itnar

3302.7 --> 3308.1189999999997
how is your house did it survive

3308.88 --> 3311.42
damn

3319.26 --> 3324.2400000000002
I've been easy to listen to first thing

3321.78 --> 3327.8590000000004
in my morning oh all right oh thanks for

3324.24 --> 3327.859
that lumpy guys I appreciate that

3329.579 --> 3335.579
because yeah don't forget often if I get

3333.42 --> 3339.059
angry again and it seems to happen

3335.579 --> 3341.099
regularly sometimes it's pissing me off

3339.059 --> 3342.98
and but then the pissing off is the

3341.099 --> 3345.6600000000003
problem really

3342.98 --> 3348.72
but I don't it does not make me feel

3345.66 --> 3352.5589999999997
great when I get all really angry again

3348.72 --> 3355.5589999999997
I mean it might be well placed and

3352.559 --> 3357.96
appropriate even to a degree but it

3355.559 --> 3361.619
makes me feel terrible

3357.96 --> 3365.76
every time afterward

3361.619 --> 3368.76
I wish I could like not do that anymore

3365.76 --> 3371.46
because I feel so I feel like a [ __ ]

3368.76 --> 3373.44
hypocrite too

3371.46 --> 3375.839
I feel like a hypocrite when it happens

3373.44 --> 3378.119
because it's like yeah

3375.839 --> 3380.7
I get all blood first you know that but

3378.119 --> 3383.4
like I'm never gonna do that

3380.7 --> 3385.5
like and even if I would get to the

3383.4 --> 3388.26
point of doing that it would be nothing

3385.5 --> 3391.5
like that experience

3388.26 --> 3394.94
will be no rage and energy

3391.5 --> 3394.94
like that at all

3395.64 --> 3399.7799999999997
and it just

3397.079 --> 3400.8590000000004
it pisses me off it makes me feel like

3399.78 --> 3402.5400000000004
I'm

3400.859 --> 3407.0589999999997
like

3402.54 --> 3407.0589999999997
giving a twisted view of reality almost

3416.099 --> 3423.7200000000003
I just wish I could like bypass that

3420.48 --> 3425.52
or like not have it be so Savage every

3423.72 --> 3427.6189999999997
time

3425.52 --> 3429.839
because I bet that that is also the

3427.619 --> 3431.28
thing that basically keeps me completely

3429.839 --> 3434.4
out of the

3431.28 --> 3438.3
Loop in ways and I don't want that

3434.4 --> 3439.92
anymore I want to be more adaptable I

3438.3 --> 3442.92
want to be

3439.92 --> 3447.119
a person that could be named out there

3442.92 --> 3450.599
because people weren't like terrified to

3447.119 --> 3454.28
have any form of association with me

3450.599 --> 3454.28
besides Nathan Oakley

3456.839 --> 3461.22
I mean even the rest of the guys there

3459.0 --> 3463.2
are not yeah they're friendly but

3461.22 --> 3465.5
they're not gonna associate with me a

3463.2 --> 3465.5
lot of them

3466.02 --> 3472.74
not everybody but it's just

3469.74 --> 3472.74
foreign

3492.839 --> 3498.2
that is the dumbest [ __ ] thing I've

3495.66 --> 3498.2
ever heard

3501.54 --> 3504.8
what the hell man

3508.819 --> 3513.18
what the [ __ ] is up with and all those

3511.14 --> 3515.16
[ __ ] people that just get on the

3513.18 --> 3517.44
street and block track like what the

3515.16 --> 3520.859
[ __ ] is wrong with them these people

3517.44 --> 3523.98
need to be locked in asylums literally

3520.859 --> 3525.24
they're a danger to themselves and

3523.98 --> 3528.14
others

3525.24 --> 3532.4399999999996
per definition

3528.14 --> 3535.04
they're a danger to themselves and

3532.44 --> 3535.04
others

3539.04 --> 3548.819
only a lunatic puts their hand in cement

3543.839 --> 3550.339
until it hardens only a lunatic does

3548.819 --> 3555.54
that

3550.339 --> 3559.0789999999997
they need to be locked up in asylums

3555.54 --> 3561.5589999999997
they are a danger to others and

3559.079 --> 3561.559
themselves

3563.059 --> 3568.7400000000002
not throw away the key

3566.22 --> 3572.22
no you don't need to throw away the key

3568.74 --> 3577.5
they just need to be stopped right put

3572.22 --> 3580.3999999999996
in Asylum or yeah in a institution where

3577.5 --> 3583.74
they can be taken care of and basically

3580.4 --> 3588.48
deprogrammed it from this cult

3583.74 --> 3592.319
yeah you can get people out of cults

3588.48 --> 3595.5
there is like programs for that

3592.319 --> 3597.359
to get people out of calls get the call

3595.5 --> 3600.9
out of their mind

3597.359 --> 3603.54
it's pretty it's a pretty heavy process

3600.9 --> 3606.7200000000003
to get that done but it is doable and it

3603.54 --> 3609.72
has been adapted I've known people that

3606.72 --> 3609.91
have been in Cults and that got out of

3609.72 --> 3613.0499999999997
it

3609.91 --> 3613.0499999999997
[Music]

3616.079 --> 3621.059
like with that help

3619.38 --> 3623.88
because you're going to be fighting off

3621.059 --> 3625.799
trying to automatically roll back in

3623.88 --> 3627.9
that's typically what Cults do they

3625.799 --> 3628.98
program you in such a way that you can't

3627.9 --> 3632.0
leave

3628.98 --> 3637.28
not because they don't let you leave but

3632.0 --> 3637.28
they make you not let yourself leave

3637.74 --> 3640.5789999999997
programming

3641.339 --> 3645.18
they make you think that you're

3643.44 --> 3646.859
dependent and that you're always that

3645.18 --> 3650.5789999999997
you want to go back that's like almost

3646.859 --> 3653.16
an addiction response right

3650.579 --> 3658.02
but that can be taken care of and these

3653.16 --> 3660.1189999999997
new climate cultists they are provably a

3658.02 --> 3664.559
danger to themselves and others and they

3660.119 --> 3666.78
should absolutely be apprehended

3664.559 --> 3670.8590000000004
and secured

3666.78 --> 3673.079
in a medical facility

3670.859 --> 3676.02
or they can be treated

3673.079 --> 3677.7000000000003
for their mental illness

3676.02 --> 3678.98
and

3677.7 --> 3682.819
like

3678.98 --> 3682.819
disconnected from their cult

3683.819 --> 3686.66
needs to happen

3688.38 --> 3693.1800000000003
yeah and as far as I'm concerned dude

3691.02 --> 3696.0
I'm at the point where I'm like so

3693.18 --> 3698.339
[ __ ] sick of these [ __ ] [ __ ]

3696.0 --> 3702.42
dystopian future Netflix movies and

3698.339 --> 3707.04
series I'm so sick of it oh it have

3702.42 --> 3710.4
always some stupid sjw sounding [ __ ] oh

3707.04 --> 3713.7
it had to happen always that stupid way

3710.4 --> 3717.9
they use their voice so [ __ ] arrogant

3713.7 --> 3721.5
and pretentious every [ __ ] time it

3717.9 --> 3724.619
sucks like now I like it hover over

3721.5 --> 3726.799
something it's like oh yeah of course it

3724.619 --> 3731.76
had to happen and immediately like

3726.799 --> 3734.819
delete that [ __ ] I want it deleted

3731.76 --> 3738.42
get rid of these [ __ ] [ __ ]

3734.819 --> 3741.24
dystopian future [ __ ] things oh we

3738.42 --> 3744.359
had to ruin the climate again [ __ ] you

3741.24 --> 3748.22
get rid of them

3744.359 --> 3748.22
they should be illegal

3750.18 --> 3757.02
they're part of the climate cult

3753.0 --> 3760.98
it should be made illegal

3757.02 --> 3763.68
yeah top down red lights to scripts like

3760.98 --> 3765.9
that like yeah you should just not be

3763.68 --> 3766.98
allowed to do that anymore

3765.9 --> 3769.02
yeah

3766.98 --> 3771.9
just like you're not allowed to make

3769.02 --> 3775.079
child porn right

3771.9 --> 3776.76
not allowed these [ __ ] up oh we

3775.079 --> 3780.54
destroyed it all through climate change

3776.76 --> 3784.98
movies anymore it should be forbidden

3780.54 --> 3784.98
it should be forbidden

3785.16 --> 3788.8999999999996
because of the dangers

3790.2 --> 3796.6189999999997
palpable dangers that are around there's

3793.68 --> 3799.0789999999997
damage being done indirectly by people

3796.619 --> 3800.76
that are being influenced by that type

3799.079 --> 3805.26
of media product

3800.76 --> 3805.26
and so they need to be forbidden

3812.48 --> 3818.88
standing in the road is dangerous it is

3815.04 --> 3822.18
illegal lumpy gas in the vacuum

3818.88 --> 3825.1400000000003
and if police don't get rid of them they

3822.18 --> 3825.14
are negligent

3830.04 --> 3835.319
right they're just as negligent by

3832.68 --> 3839.3999999999996
letting climate call tests block the

3835.319 --> 3842.46
road as they are when they let a bunch

3839.4 --> 3845.1600000000003
of writing crazy people Loot and burn

3842.46 --> 3849.599
down into grocery stores it's the same

3845.16 --> 3849.5989999999997
[ __ ] thing it's negligence

3851.76 --> 3857.3390000000004
and

3853.4 --> 3859.079
incapability because the some [ __ ]

3857.339 --> 3861.7799999999997
psychopath

3859.079 --> 3863.819
is the judge there or the mayor or

3861.78 --> 3864.5400000000004
whatever or the police chief and they

3863.819 --> 3866.7599999999998
just

3864.54 --> 3868.92
they're not allowed to do anything about

3866.76 --> 3870.7200000000003
it I've heard of stories where there's

3868.92 --> 3873.42
places in America

3870.72 --> 3876.0
where you're not allowed to even address

3873.42 --> 3878.099
a shoplifter

3876.0 --> 3880.859
somebody steal something out of your

3878.099 --> 3882.7200000000003
store you're not even allowed to address

3880.859 --> 3884.22
them about it

3882.72 --> 3886.6189999999997
and there were stores where there's

3884.22 --> 3890.339
literally shoplifting happening

3886.619 --> 3893.099
over 50 times a day

3890.339 --> 3895.319
until they basically close up shop

3893.099 --> 3896.7000000000003
because they couldn't handle the losses

3895.319 --> 3899.94
anymore

3896.7 --> 3902.7
yeah that's because

3899.94 --> 3904.92
it's top down blocked it's literally

3902.7 --> 3907.3799999999997
encouraging criminality and the same

3904.92 --> 3909.839
goes for this climate cultism

3907.38 --> 3911.579
it's criminal and it's being encouraged

3909.839 --> 3913.44
top down

3911.579 --> 3916.44
people that are doing that should be

3913.44 --> 3919.26
arrested yeah the climate cultists they

3916.44 --> 3921.7200000000003
should get medical treatment for that

3919.26 --> 3924.599
the police Chiefs

3921.72 --> 3927.24
all that that are actually preventing

3924.599 --> 3929.76
police from doing their job and keeping

3927.24 --> 3934.16
order and preventing criminality those

3929.76 --> 3934.1600000000003
should go to jail for life

3934.28 --> 3937.3390000000004
thank you

3938.04 --> 3942.18
if not just straight out stoned to death

3940.5 --> 3944.94
at this point

3942.18 --> 3946.799
in some regions I mean so much [ __ ]

3944.94 --> 3949.02
damage has been done by those types of

3946.799 --> 3950.94
people they should be identified have

3949.02 --> 3955.02
their picture

3950.94 --> 3958.26
like hung with posters on the streets so

3955.02 --> 3961.02
that everybody knows that guy that is

3958.26 --> 3964.1600000000003
the guy that has literally trashed this

3961.02 --> 3968.04
place with his [ __ ] judgment yeah

3964.16 --> 3972.92
this is where he lives

3968.04 --> 3972.92
now feel free to do something about it

3981.74 --> 3985.64
that's my recommendation

3988.18 --> 3991.3799999999997
[Music]

3995.43 --> 3998.64
[Music]

3999.48 --> 4005.96
yeah you have to know

4002.299 --> 4007.579
you have to know who is ordered the

4005.96 --> 4011.26
police

4007.579 --> 4011.26
to not do anything

4011.839 --> 4017.119
who has made that happen you have to

4014.72 --> 4020.74
identify the people

4017.119 --> 4023.539
that have put that into place and then

4020.74 --> 4027.14
publicize it make sure that everybody

4023.539 --> 4029.42
gets to see their face

4027.14 --> 4031.8799999999997
yeah and I mean you could just print out

4029.42 --> 4033.92
thousands of thousands of pamphlets or

4031.88 --> 4036.5
something and just stick them to the

4033.92 --> 4038.42
lantern poles and you put their [ __ ]

4036.5 --> 4040.88
address on there everything and yeah

4038.42 --> 4043.339
it's [ __ ] illegal [ __ ] that you just

4040.88 --> 4044.599
do it anyway make sure you don't get

4043.339 --> 4046.7599999999998
caught

4044.599 --> 4047.78
or whatever you just run away or

4046.76 --> 4049.8190000000004
something

4047.78 --> 4051.619
what I mean what the [ __ ] police gonna

4049.819 --> 4054.799
arrest you for that while they literally

4051.619 --> 4058.039
let people steal from stores no [ __ ]

4054.799 --> 4061.0389999999998
that it's it's Anarchy it's chaos

4058.039 --> 4064.2200000000003
you could just as well print out posters

4061.039 --> 4066.619
with their face on it and their address

4064.22 --> 4070.8799999999997
calling for people to do something about

4066.619 --> 4073.1600000000003
it right because that trash everywhere

4070.88 --> 4075.26
and that crime and people getting just

4073.16 --> 4077.359
attacked in the street and nobody ever

4075.26 --> 4079.3390000000004
doing anything about it yeah that's

4077.359 --> 4082.0989999999997
because of those people

4079.339 --> 4084.92
that prevent the police from being able

4082.099 --> 4087.2000000000003
to do anything about it yeah and they

4084.92 --> 4090.799
should be publicized they should be

4087.2 --> 4092.299
known who they are with their face and

4090.799 --> 4094.7599999999998
their address

4092.299 --> 4097.88
put it all over the city so that

4094.76 --> 4100.52
everybody knows who does that

4097.88 --> 4102.859
yeah and then it's just a matter of time

4100.52 --> 4105.080000000001
before somebody out there is going to be

4102.859 --> 4107.0
okay I'm done with this [ __ ] and this is

4105.08 --> 4109.759
now gonna end yeah

4107.0 --> 4113.179
make sure that they know who's actually

4109.759 --> 4116.44
keeping it like that who's the cause of

4113.179 --> 4116.4400000000005
it being that hell

4117.62 --> 4120.62
foreign

4153.52 --> 4158.259
yeah that's just [ __ ] insane man

4169.279 --> 4174.5
but I mean uh Canada is just a

4172.699 --> 4177.0199999999995
horrendous

4174.5 --> 4179.299
I mean you need to [ __ ] assassinate

4177.02 --> 4180.38
Your Leader there you need to do it

4179.299 --> 4185.0
because

4180.38 --> 4188.2390000000005
he's gonna [ __ ] everybody so bad

4185.0 --> 4191.42
so what's one of the most overt satanic

4188.239 --> 4193.94
Prime Ministers I've ever seen Trudeau

4191.42 --> 4197.42
is one of the worst ever

4193.94 --> 4200.719
and I mean we got one we got potentially

4197.42 --> 4202.219
the worst over here who's the most overt

4200.719 --> 4205.219
psychopath

4202.219 --> 4207.9800000000005
in power that have ever that anybody

4205.219 --> 4211.04
probably has ever witnessed okay

4207.98 --> 4213.32
but I mean even we don't do it that

4211.04 --> 4216.92
terribly

4213.32 --> 4219.739
in Canada it's so [ __ ] up I mean there

4216.92 --> 4222.14
is no other cars of there's nothing else

4219.739 --> 4225.139999999999
you can [ __ ] do about it

4222.14 --> 4225.14
foreign

4225.38 --> 4230.4800000000005
because there's just one message that's

4227.84 --> 4233.12
rolling out to everybody in Canada from

4230.48 --> 4237.32
from your government and that is kill

4233.12 --> 4239.599999999999
yourself die we don't care

4237.32 --> 4242.299999999999
we don't care about your problems we

4239.6 --> 4245.2390000000005
don't care about the your problems that

4242.3 --> 4247.46
we've caused [ __ ] die kill yourself

4245.239 --> 4249.919999999999
that's their message

4247.46 --> 4254.26
they're getting very overt about it

4249.92 --> 4254.26
you should do something about it

4255.02 --> 4258.92
or die

4257.06 --> 4261.679
and you should tell that to everybody

4258.92 --> 4265.46
around you like yeah

4261.679 --> 4270.32
yeah we could all just slowly wither and

4265.46 --> 4273.28
die humiliated and crippled and poisoned

4270.32 --> 4273.28
or

4273.5 --> 4278.84
we do something about it and [ __ ]

4277.159 --> 4283.48
[ __ ] everything

4278.84 --> 4283.4800000000005
like [ __ ] whatever happens after that

4283.94 --> 4287.15
[Music]

4290.86 --> 4294.049999999999
[Music]

4298.82 --> 4305.44
yeah I know Richard G I know

4301.58 --> 4305.44
you should do something about it

4323.12 --> 4328.159
full cope

4324.82 --> 4332.36
nah it's faux

4328.159 --> 4335.44
French for fake remember

4332.36 --> 4335.44
who called

4335.55 --> 4338.659000000001
[Music]

4338.9 --> 4342.759999999999
because that's literally it

4342.92 --> 4351.28
that the globe in a nutshell

4346.06 --> 4351.280000000001
foe call it's the cult of fake

4355.64 --> 4361.9400000000005
didn't no it is it isn't that's what I

4359.84 --> 4364.52
made of it I called it folk called in

4361.94 --> 4367.9
2016 and it is the best way to say it

4364.52 --> 4367.900000000001
come on you know that

4371.54 --> 4375.58
because Pho you know

4406.4 --> 4412.159
yeah no [ __ ] Sherlock I know that

4409.06 --> 4414.26
Elementary my dear Watson you don't have

4412.159 --> 4415.82
to tell me

4414.26 --> 4418.92
logical conclusion

4415.82 --> 4418.92
[Music]

4448.219 --> 4457.52
right so my my Universal tactic remains

4452.54 --> 4459.5199999999995
you have to know who's literally the the

4457.52 --> 4462.8
Cornerstone who has the Cornerstone

4459.52 --> 4465.679
responsibility in these cities that are

4462.8 --> 4467.659000000001
going to hell who has the Cornerstone

4465.679 --> 4471.28
responsibility

4467.659 --> 4471.28
for the police operations

4475.04 --> 4481.64
that's what you need to focus on who did

4478.64 --> 4484.280000000001
that who kept it in that way

4481.64 --> 4487.280000000001
those people need to be known those

4484.28 --> 4490.54
people need to be known and recognized

4487.28 --> 4490.54
with their face

4490.719 --> 4497.9
everywhere do that I'm I'm literally

4494.179 --> 4501.62
telling you in America do that

4497.9 --> 4504.799999999999
the faces of the people that have put it

4501.62 --> 4508.219
in place to be that hellhole they need

4504.8 --> 4510.860000000001
to be identified and everybody needs to

4508.219 --> 4514.76
know what they look like what they're

4510.86 --> 4516.739
called and potentially where they live

4514.76 --> 4518.179
but yeah if you're gonna add that

4516.739 --> 4520.4
information

4518.179 --> 4523.04
then it will be tricky because you might

4520.4 --> 4524.239
get arrested as you're spreading that

4523.04 --> 4527.54
poster

4524.239 --> 4530.54
so you got to balance it out carefully

4527.54 --> 4533.78
this is just just highlight the targets

4530.54 --> 4537.14
highlight the cause yeah that's what you

4533.78 --> 4540.199
do you highlight the cause

4537.14 --> 4543.8
get the person that's causing the

4540.199 --> 4547.099999999999
situation known so that everybody can

4543.8 --> 4549.02
focus on that and I don't like oh those

4547.1 --> 4552.88
damn neighbors or whatever the [ __ ]

4549.02 --> 4552.88
they're gonna blame for it yeah

4553.04 --> 4559.94
make sure that everybody knows who has

4557.0 --> 4563.12
put those [ __ ] up systems in place

4559.94 --> 4566.96
so that criminals don't get arrested

4563.12 --> 4570.82
it needs to be like really really well

4566.96 --> 4570.82
known by everybody there

4574.52 --> 4579.9800000000005
and then if enough people know and

4577.28 --> 4582.8
eventually they'll start to draw some

4579.98 --> 4585.32
conclusions and maybe [ __ ] do

4582.8 --> 4588.4400000000005
something about it yeah

4585.32 --> 4591.38
but before that happens everybody needs

4588.44 --> 4595.46
that Focus point a point

4591.38 --> 4598.28
person that they can absolutely know

4595.46 --> 4599.96
about that they are the ones that did

4598.28 --> 4602.719
that

4599.96 --> 4608.54
do that

4602.719 --> 4608.54
this may actually be a solution strategy

4610.84 --> 4614.9800000000005
so anybody listening

4615.44 --> 4619.599999999999
those hell hole cities where crime has

4617.96 --> 4622.2390000000005
been legalized

4619.6 --> 4627.8
learn learn

4622.239 --> 4630.139999999999
who exactly has put that in place

4627.8 --> 4632.42
that the police literally can't do

4630.14 --> 4635.06
anything about crime who put it into

4632.42 --> 4638.36
place those rules is the police chief

4635.06 --> 4642.38
it's the mayor whoever the [ __ ] it is

4638.36 --> 4646.159
get the individual identified and then

4642.38 --> 4650.42
spread the knowledge on posters with

4646.159 --> 4653.139999999999
their face very clearly identifiable

4650.42 --> 4657.56
and spread it around so that everybody

4653.14 --> 4660.02
gets to see that everybody every [ __ ]

4657.56 --> 4663.26
body and I mean like on every goddamned

4660.02 --> 4664.780000000001
Lantern Pole every goddamn Lantern pole

4663.26 --> 4667.9400000000005
in the entire city

4664.78 --> 4669.739
every [ __ ] one of them

4667.94 --> 4671.54
as far as you can

4669.739 --> 4673.218999999999
I mean if you literally do everybody

4671.54 --> 4677.12
you're going to need a lot of people and

4673.219 --> 4679.42
a lot of pamphlets but get radical about

4677.12 --> 4679.42
it

4679.64 --> 4685.179
right

4681.1 --> 4685.179
that's my recommendation

4688.52 --> 4693.26
right

4690.86 --> 4695.42
and for the joke of it you could even

4693.26 --> 4697.280000000001
like turn it into a Most Wanted or

4695.42 --> 4699.4400000000005
whatever but that might be like over

4697.28 --> 4700.759999999999
more overtly illegal get you even more

4699.44 --> 4703.5199999999995
trouble in

4700.76 --> 4705.1990000000005
but anyway

4703.52 --> 4708.5
figure it out

4705.199 --> 4711.5599999999995
it's a worthwhile thing to try out and

4708.5 --> 4713.6
it may actually fix the situation on the

4711.56 --> 4717.080000000001
long run if you do that right you just

4713.6 --> 4720.08
need to have people that do that that

4717.08 --> 4725.62
are causing that entire situation to be

4720.08 --> 4725.62
very very exposed that's what you need

4728.96 --> 4733.699
right and it could be that like even

4731.48 --> 4735.199
doing that will make them resign because

4733.699 --> 4737.0599999999995
there's literally going to [ __ ] their

4735.199 --> 4739.339999999999
pants once they see that their face is

4737.06 --> 4741.92
everywhere because they know they're

4739.34 --> 4743.96
doing that they know they're [ __ ] all

4741.92 --> 4747.02
over the town when they do that they're

4743.96 --> 4749.179
very well aware of it yeah

4747.02 --> 4751.64
so what could happen then is Oh They'll

4749.179 --> 4754.28
resign and some other flunky takes over

4751.64 --> 4756.5
well if he's gonna reinforce the same

4754.28 --> 4760.4
rules guess what you're gonna do it

4756.5 --> 4763.219
again and this time it's their face

4760.4 --> 4764.839999999999
and their name and potentially address

4763.219 --> 4767.9
and you just

4764.84 --> 4771.219
do it until

4767.9 --> 4771.219
no more flunkies

4771.5 --> 4776.719
do I have these protests in Netherlands

4774.02 --> 4779.320000000001
yes we have those [ __ ] idiots in the

4776.719 --> 4779.32
Netherlands too

4785.54 --> 4790.219
next great video too of literally like

4788.36 --> 4793.58
citizens

4790.219 --> 4796.46
like dragging them out of the street and

4793.58 --> 4800.659
even throwing them out like throwing it

4796.46 --> 4803.3
like on the side like good I like it

4800.659 --> 4805.339999999999
[ __ ] them up

4803.3 --> 4808.58
dude if it were up to me it would be

4805.34 --> 4811.3
just like okay just just plank that

4808.58 --> 4811.3
truck just

4813.08 --> 4816.98
just do that dude just [ __ ] do it

4815.48 --> 4821.739
just [ __ ] him up

4816.98 --> 4821.739
[ __ ] them [ __ ] the climate cultists

4821.78 --> 4824.96
I mean if you really want to make a

4823.76 --> 4828.02
difference

4824.96 --> 4830.96
just put gasoline over yourself and

4828.02 --> 4833.179
light yourself in bonfire in your

4830.96 --> 4837.159
climate protest yeah I think it will be

4833.179 --> 4837.159
very fitting end for your kind

4839.78 --> 4842.739
foreign

4845.28 --> 4850.4
[Music]

4846.82 --> 4852.679
or all put your just

4850.4 --> 4855.08
if maybe like a hundred of them and then

4852.679 --> 4857.36
all put their hand in the same puddle of

4855.08 --> 4860.719
concrete that would be great too I mean

4857.36 --> 4863.36
they're definitely not gonna be in our

4860.719 --> 4866.06
way after that point you just leave them

4863.36 --> 4870.259999999999
just leave them like that could create a

4866.06 --> 4872.84
whole new industry like special food and

4870.26 --> 4875.2390000000005
[ __ ] cleanup

4872.84 --> 4877.1
but at least they are not gonna get on

4875.239 --> 4879.86
the street if they have their hands

4877.1 --> 4881.96
locked into a piece of concrete

4879.86 --> 4884.78
what's that on my shirt that's the early

4881.96 --> 4887.3
bird logo you should recognize it it's

4884.78 --> 4889.159
right next to the early bird logo in the

4887.3 --> 4892.12
video

4889.159 --> 4892.12
can't you see

4892.64 --> 4897.820000000001
it's the early bird logo right next to

4895.1 --> 4897.820000000001
the real thing

4902.4 --> 4905.61
[Music]

4909.68 --> 4914.289000000001
[Music]

4952.34 --> 4957.62
mean there should be a very serious

4954.5 --> 4960.739
Revolution I mean it's over guys it is

4957.62 --> 4964.58
[ __ ] over this [ __ ] priest [ __ ]

it's over it's not gonna happen

4968.06 --> 4974.4800000000005
the only peaceful solution is you die

5135.82 --> 5140.98
this [ __ ] notion that we can find a

5139.0 --> 5143.44
peaceful solution to this

5140.98 --> 5147.0599999999995

5152.32 --> 5157.54

this they have to be exterminated they

5157.54 --> 5164.94
are literally saying we have to be

5159.76 --> 5164.9400000000005
exterminated and they are doing it yeah

5165.1 --> 5173.139
but we don't want to be evil like them

5167.38 --> 5175.96
well then die then you [ __ ] [ __ ]

5173.139 --> 5177.88
yeah you aren't like them you have

5175.96 --> 5180.58
feelings you have things

5177.88 --> 5182.92
you have natural impulses and you have a

resentment against being evil and evil

5182.92 --> 5189.04

5184.84 --> 5191.9800000000005

5189.04 --> 5195.04
like War yeah it's War it's literally

5191.98 --> 5197.138999999999
War when there's war there's people that

5195.04 --> 5199.96
get sent out to be absolutely

5197.139 --> 5203.52
slaughtered yeah you think that's good

5199.96 --> 5206.199
oh because of what uh

5203.52 --> 5208.900000000001
some struggle

5206.199 --> 5210.94
you think that's no so why is that okay

5208.9 --> 5213.759999999999
it's okay to send soldiers to slaughter

5210.94 --> 5216.159
people to blow up weddings and

5213.76 --> 5218.860000000001
they get killed

5216.159 --> 5220.839999999999
you get PTSD and all [ __ ] up and then

5218.86 --> 5222.88
ignore it at the hospital later right

5220.84 --> 5226.360000000001
that's okay

5222.88 --> 5229.4800000000005
but I mean you oh we can't actually do

5226.36 --> 5232.299999999999
violence internally we can't do that

5229.48 --> 5233.739
just leave that to their random racist

5232.3 --> 5236.26
murderers

5233.739 --> 5239.08
that just attack innocent people on the

5236.26 --> 5241.54
streets right just let that happen

5239.08 --> 5244.36
though right we won't do anything

5241.54 --> 5247.659
because that's evil but I mean it's not

5244.36 --> 5249.88
evil to just let everything be hell and

5247.659 --> 5251.86
innocent people getting murdered and

5249.88 --> 5253.719
assaulted all the time that's okay

5251.86 --> 5255.46
though

5253.719 --> 5258.82
yeah or

5255.46 --> 5261.46
or maybe stop this [ __ ] [ __ ]

5258.82 --> 5264.48
notion that you can get out of this with

5261.46 --> 5264.4800000000005
a peaceful solution

5271.659 --> 5278.82

dust like on your skin or like on your

gonna start reacting with the sweat and

5495.82 --> 5501.9
it's [ __ ] painful dude like it can

unless it's gonna crash immediately

5656.739 --> 5661.419999999999
do you think losing a hand is enough to

5659.679 --> 5663.82
shake some sense in those people no

5661.42 --> 5666.46
it'll make it much worse

5663.82 --> 5669.58
because now they sacrificed they

5666.46 --> 5671.62
literally sacrificed their body

5669.58 --> 5673.9
to the cause yeah

5671.62 --> 5675.76
yeah it's much harder to step away from

5673.9 --> 5678.099999999999
it after that point

5675.76 --> 5680.320000000001
the more you sacrifice the more you lost

5678.1 --> 5681.88
to your [ __ ] up delusion the harder it

5680.32 --> 5684.639
is to get out of it

5681.88 --> 5687.1
because if you get out of it you're made

5684.639 --> 5691.26
much more aware of how much you actually

5687.1 --> 5691.26
lost and it was for nothing

5696.1 --> 5702.159000000001
so it will not shake some sense in these

5698.98 --> 5703.48
people it will make it worse

5702.159 --> 5706.9
yeah

5703.48 --> 5710.5599999999995
like mutilating cultist doesn't help it

5706.9 --> 5713.219
only strengthens their idiotic fate

5710.56 --> 5713.219
faith

5713.5 --> 5719.4
right as the martyrdom effect

5716.199 --> 5719.4
it's tied in that

5719.44 --> 5724.36
right that's why it's best to like

5722.199 --> 5726.82
either just leave them

5724.36 --> 5729.04
or like if they really need to go then

5726.82 --> 5731.5599999999995
just [ __ ] kill them

5729.04 --> 5733.36
that I but I wouldn't do anything in

5731.56 --> 5736.120000000001
between

5733.36 --> 5738.82
because anything you really do to them

5736.12 --> 5741.159
is just gonna make them more angry and

5738.82 --> 5742.96
more feel more marketer-ish about

5741.159 --> 5746.82
themselves

5742.96 --> 5746.82
which makes them more arrogant

5748.239 --> 5750.839999999999
so

5751.719 --> 5754.26
right

5754.48 --> 5759.459999999999
so yeah you have three options you just

5756.639 --> 5762.28
avoid them as much as you can

5759.46 --> 5764.679
get them in a mental hospital because

5762.28 --> 5766.86
they will need it or you [ __ ] kill

5764.679 --> 5766.86
them

5767.139 --> 5771.4800000000005
but I wouldn't do anything in between

5768.88 --> 5771.4800000000005
really

5773.679 --> 5780.96
physically hurting them is only gonna

5775.96 --> 5780.96
make them more Angry like wasps

5783.699 --> 5787.9
all right if you're gonna get rid of

5785.139 --> 5792.6
them you gotta get rid of them

5787.9 --> 5792.599999999999
don't do have jobs in that sense

5798.159 --> 5804.699
besides those [ __ ] freaks they like

5801.82 --> 5808.96
that these are the same people that

5804.699 --> 5811.239
literally make themselves handicapped

5808.96 --> 5813.76
it's the same type of people so if you

5811.239 --> 5815.919999999999
if they if that girl is gonna lose their

5813.76 --> 5817.900000000001
hand they're gonna be proud of it that

5815.92 --> 5819.82
they did that for climate change I'm not

5817.9 --> 5821.44
joking guys

5819.82 --> 5824.139
yeah

5821.44 --> 5828.419999999999
that girl's gonna be tied in with that

5824.139 --> 5828.42
[ __ ] movement the rest of her life

5843.34 --> 5847.4800000000005
I mean you got to realize we're talking

5845.08 --> 5849.719
about the same level of people where

5847.48 --> 5853.0599999999995
there's factions that literally

5849.719 --> 5856.62
literally castrate themselves

5853.06 --> 5856.620000000001
for climate change okay

5862.42 --> 5869.1990000000005
those those people

5864.42 --> 5872.92
they mutilate themselves

5869.199 --> 5875.62
like climate change freak cultists

5872.92 --> 5877.84
typically they have no problem with

5875.62 --> 5880.599999999999
self-mutilation because they think that

5877.84 --> 5882.400000000001
they are the problem in that sense

5880.6 --> 5883.84
they think humanity is the problem they

5882.4 --> 5885.94
think they are the problem so it's like

5883.84 --> 5888.52
yeah if you lose a part of your body

5885.94 --> 5890.919999999999
well that will reduce your CO2 output

5888.52 --> 5895.42
they will literally argue that to you

5890.92 --> 5897.54
okay these people are [ __ ] up

5895.42 --> 5897.54
okay

5900.639 --> 5905.92
because just think about it if you just

5902.739 --> 5907.98
didn't have any legs that will save you

5905.92 --> 5912.1
what is it

5907.98 --> 5914.379999999999
one third of body mass maybe more

5912.1 --> 5918.1
well all that money Mass needs less food

5914.38 --> 5921.28
and that has less CO2 output so cutting

5918.1 --> 5925.179
your legs off is good for climate change

5921.28 --> 5927.099999999999
cultist why don't you try it out

5925.179 --> 5929.4400000000005
I'm dead serious maybe you should all

5927.1 --> 5931.320000000001
just [ __ ] cut your legs off

5929.44 --> 5934.0599999999995
and that way

5931.32 --> 5935.679
it's going to be less difficult to get

5934.06 --> 5938.02
you off the streets because you could

5935.679 --> 5941.26
simply roll you with your wheelchairs

5938.02 --> 5943.42
could just roll you out of the way

5941.26 --> 5946.12
it's better than dragging you with those

5943.42 --> 5948.84
legs still stuck to you with all that

5946.12 --> 5948.84
extra weight

5953.15 --> 5956.25
[Music]

5963.159 --> 5968.44
corporations yeah but the corporations

5965.56 --> 5969.76
can't do anything if they're held a task

5968.44 --> 5972.599999999999
by the law

5969.76 --> 5972.6
more color

5973.48 --> 5978.54
you realize that government can just say

5976.42 --> 5981.9400000000005
nope

5978.54 --> 5985.6
any second they can just do it you can

5981.94 --> 5987.699
say nope you're not allowed to do that

5985.6 --> 5990.219
but they don't

5987.699 --> 5993.699
and that's the problem

5990.219 --> 5996.34
that's what I'm saying big part probably

5993.699 --> 5998.138999999999
key part of all of that [ __ ] that

5996.34 --> 6000.860000000001
happens in the big cities where all that

5998.139 --> 6004.32
crazy shit's going on and all looting

6000.86 --> 6007.32
it's the police Chiefs a lot of the time

6004.32 --> 6009.42
police chief mayor

6007.32 --> 6011.5199999999995
those are the ones that are doing that

6009.42 --> 6014.4
yeah the corporations are just doing

6011.52 --> 6016.620000000001
what they do because they can get away

6014.4 --> 6018.9
with it just like the [ __ ] looters

6016.62 --> 6021.9
they're just looting because they can

6018.9 --> 6026.96
get away with it yeah if the law is

6021.9 --> 6026.96
enforced they stop doing it

6028.86 --> 6034.219
that's the issue that's why you should

6030.84 --> 6036.360000000001
have posters of those key people

6034.219 --> 6039.12
everywhere so that they're known

6036.36 --> 6044.099999999999
everybody knows who is causing that [ __ ]

6039.12 --> 6046.5
yeah police Chiefs Mayors those are the

6044.1 --> 6049.58
ones those are the ones that are turning

6046.5 --> 6049.58
it into a hell hole

6052.08 --> 6059.659
hey now I got both movies downloaded huh

6056.699 --> 6059.659
both the same

6060.0 --> 6065.699
I guess the other one did come online

6061.5 --> 6069.719
cool I guess I'll be watching

6065.699 --> 6072.62
is it again rare exports

6069.719 --> 6072.62
somewhere tonight

6074.58 --> 6076.58
um

6087.48 --> 6091.28
this is such a dark place dude

6097.139 --> 6102.84
slow moment oh my God that type of

6099.78 --> 6105.0599999999995
people they bring they seriously bring

6102.84 --> 6107.42
out the Nazi at me

6105.06 --> 6109.92
because I do have like

6107.42 --> 6113.119
you might have spot but I mean that's

6109.92 --> 6113.119
like when I do

6121.26 --> 6126.4800000000005
let's just say and it's not gonna happen

6123.659 --> 6128.28
but I mean that person like that talked

6126.48 --> 6130.138999999999
to me like that and the world was

6128.28 --> 6131.639
slightly different I literally get my

6130.139 --> 6134.42
Luger and just shoot him in the face

6131.639 --> 6134.42
right on the spot

6137.06 --> 6142.04
just [ __ ] you die [ __ ]

6142.08 --> 6146.9
you're a demon you need to get out of

6144.78 --> 6146.9
here

6147.03 --> 6150.09
[Music]

6153.42 --> 6160.1990000000005
yep people let's say the natural order

6156.6 --> 6161.9400000000005
of things shouldn't be yeah

6160.199 --> 6164.4
how about

6161.94 --> 6168.678999999999
I create a little natural order with

6164.4 --> 6168.679
this bullet in your [ __ ] skull [ __ ]

6184.5 --> 6188.9
I mean I am I probably yeah

6189.06 --> 6193.26
at least I do if a person talked to me

6191.699 --> 6195.78
like that now

6193.26 --> 6198.320000000001
I'd punch them in the face just just

6195.78 --> 6198.32
like that

6199.86 --> 6205.5599999999995
and if they're particularly [ __ ] up

6203.219 --> 6207.78
about it I punched them really hard so

6205.56 --> 6210.9800000000005
they'd probably break their nose and

6207.78 --> 6210.98
maybe punch in all the time

6212.219 --> 6217.42
a little bit more angle upward

6214.33 --> 6217.42
[Music]

6221.1 --> 6225.42
I'm gonna stop talking like this it's

6223.5 --> 6227.639
just gross

6225.42 --> 6230.54
I just [ __ ] hate these people I hate

6227.639 --> 6230.54
them so bad

6231.119 --> 6235.44
like

6232.619 --> 6236.88
even when I was a [ __ ] liberal weirdo

6235.44 --> 6239.94
idiot

6236.88 --> 6243.2390000000005
and I was afraid of climate change I was

6239.94 --> 6246.5
never that [ __ ] I was never like that

6243.239 --> 6250.619
I was never like oh we have to die

6246.5 --> 6252.0
never never never never and I've been

6250.619 --> 6253.799999999999
surrounded by people like that

6252.0 --> 6256.44
[Music]

6253.8 --> 6259.1990000000005
and I even back then I felt like yeah

6256.44 --> 6261.119
yeah you should just kill yourself man I

6259.199 --> 6263.099999999999
mean if it's that bad if the world is in

6261.119 --> 6264.96
such a bad position with all this

6263.1 --> 6267.84
overpopulation and all these [ __ ] up

6264.96 --> 6269.699
useless eaters like yourself

6267.84 --> 6270.719
then maybe you should do something about

6269.699 --> 6273.32
that

6270.719 --> 6273.32
I mean

6273.54 --> 6279.06
if you kill yourself dude for climate

6276.54 --> 6282.56
change I'll pray for you

6279.06 --> 6282.56
I've said that to people

6283.44 --> 6287.5199999999995
and that those are the one of the few

6285.84 --> 6291.26
kind of things that are kind of dark

6287.52 --> 6291.26
that I'm not ashamed about at all

6292.26 --> 6297.119000000001
because yeah if you're that much into

6294.36 --> 6299.46
that dude then [ __ ] kill yourself I

6297.119 --> 6300.96
mean it and if you're not and if you're

6299.46 --> 6303.719
gonna just bother other people then

6300.96 --> 6305.52
eventually those people will kill you if

6303.719 --> 6308.119
you're too cowardly to do it yourself

6305.52 --> 6308.119000000001
[ __ ]

6309.0 --> 6312.239
anyway yeah see you next time Mark

6310.86 --> 6314.46
caller

6312.239 --> 6317.099999999999
why do I always [ __ ] get dark at the

6314.46 --> 6321.199
end of my shows these last week

6317.1 --> 6321.1990000000005
sucks I don't want to get dark

6321.42 --> 6326.04
I don't wanna the world's so [ __ ] up

6324.0 --> 6328.44
though

6326.04 --> 6330.239
I thought that my solution part with the

6328.44 --> 6333.0599999999995
postage was a much better idea I hope

6330.239 --> 6335.58
you that sticks to mind and not me I'm

6333.06 --> 6337.26
gonna shoot you with the lure which is a

6335.58 --> 6339.54
ridiculous thing that I even said and

6337.26 --> 6341.88
why the [ __ ] did I just say that why the

6339.54 --> 6345.0
[ __ ] did I just say that

6341.88 --> 6347.6990000000005
is it just anger is it just anger that

6345.0 --> 6349.56
makes me just say like [ __ ] it I'm just

6347.699 --> 6352.0199999999995
gonna say something that sounds really

6349.56 --> 6356.42
[ __ ] but I'm so pissed off I I just

6352.02 --> 6356.42
want to say it is that what this is

6358.32 --> 6361.699
what do you guys think

6375.36 --> 6381.5
or you just don't care maybe you guys

6377.699 --> 6381.5
just ignore me when I'm like that

6387.84 --> 6393.8
[Music]

6389.52 --> 6393.8
once things get negative I spiral yeah

6393.98 --> 6397.209999999999
[Music]

6398.34 --> 6403.400000000001
I

6399.719 --> 6403.4
yeah yeah I do

6408.9 --> 6413.159
anger becomes for yeah that's a very

6411.119 --> 6416.58
good point there slo-mo moon buggy it is

6413.159 --> 6419.159
that is true

6416.58 --> 6421.5599999999995
and it has been proven even on my show

6419.159 --> 6423.54
that they get really pissed off then I

6421.56 --> 6426.139
cool down then I usually get a really

6423.54 --> 6426.139
good idea

6432.84 --> 6436.8
anger never the best response

6435.48 --> 6439.739
well

6436.8 --> 6442.4400000000005
what else are you gonna do if your heart

6439.739 --> 6444.239
just hurts from all that the terrible

6442.44 --> 6446.699
things around you what the [ __ ] are you

6444.239 --> 6450.0599999999995
gonna do are you just gonna let it let

6446.699 --> 6451.5599999999995
it sink in there like Let It Burn just

6450.06 --> 6454.080000000001
burden you out is that what you're

6451.56 --> 6457.5
supposed to do then because I'm pretty

6454.08 --> 6460.08
sure that's actually really unhealthy

6457.5 --> 6462.179
that's actually bad for your heart to

6460.08 --> 6464.4
like they have this saying in the

6462.179 --> 6465.659
Netherlands don't make a murder pit out

6464.4 --> 6468.299999999999
of your heart

6465.659 --> 6471.619
and that means don't keep it all in it

6468.3 --> 6471.619000000001
will [ __ ] [ __ ] you up

6473.34 --> 6477.119000000001
yeah

6474.659 --> 6479.28
and it does [ __ ] me up like in the past

6477.119 --> 6481.5
when I was younger and I mean really

6479.28 --> 6482.5199999999995
young so really healthy and all that

6481.5 --> 6484.92
yeah

6482.52 --> 6486.719
I had times where I had almost like had

6484.92 --> 6489.6
heart attacks

6486.719 --> 6491.82
because I would just keep in everything

6489.6 --> 6494.280000000001
because I was too afraid that people

6491.82 --> 6495.599999999999
would attack me if I got angry

6494.28 --> 6498.0
yeah

6495.6 --> 6500.1
that actually almost got me a heart

6498.0 --> 6503.52
attack when I'm a [ __ ] little kid no

6500.1 --> 6505.619000000001
less okay so can you imagine like I'm

6503.52 --> 6508.02
not gonna risk that [ __ ] now I'm not

6505.619 --> 6510.659
gonna try it anymore

6508.02 --> 6513.540000000001
I mean

6510.659 --> 6517.379999999999
I will try to avoid

6513.54 --> 6519.6
feelings of aggression if I see an

6517.38 --> 6522.3
option to do that

6519.6 --> 6524.1
that doesn't make me like cuck in the

6522.3 --> 6526.4400000000005
process

6524.1 --> 6528.900000000001
but I'm definitely not gonna like let

6526.44 --> 6531.419999999999
all that [ __ ] come by and like oh yeah

6528.9 --> 6532.92
let's just see how unbelievably horrific

6531.42 --> 6536.46
Things Are

6532.92 --> 6539.6990000000005
and then like just just swallow that

6536.46 --> 6542.78
like no no I'm not just gonna just

6539.699 --> 6542.78
swallow that yeah

6545.04 --> 6549.3
I'm gonna be [ __ ] pissed off about it

6547.32 --> 6552.86
I'm gonna take it too far I'm gonna be

6549.3 --> 6552.860000000001
talking about killing them all

6555.179 --> 6560.58
but

6556.92 --> 6563.52
if possible I'd love to avoid getting to

6560.58 --> 6566.58
that point but I mean I can't just

6563.52 --> 6568.4400000000005
always avoid it because there's so much

6566.58 --> 6571.619
[ __ ] in the world right now that

6568.44 --> 6574.08
requires some kind of action

6571.619 --> 6576.839999999999
that requires us to do more than just

6574.08 --> 6579.0599999999995
like oh well just let it happen we can't

6576.84 --> 6580.9800000000005
do anything about it it can't continue

6579.06 --> 6583.860000000001
on guys

6580.98 --> 6586.138999999999
you can't it'll be so bad at some it

6583.86 --> 6588.48
already is so [ __ ] bad it's so bad

6586.139 --> 6591.719
that people that are trying to be good

6588.48 --> 6593.459999999999
are literally getting mental issues

6591.719 --> 6596.82
from how [ __ ] up the world's getting

6593.46 --> 6598.32
okay we can't just keep going like oh

6596.82 --> 6604.219
just ignore it

6598.32 --> 6604.219
just move on it can't continue people

6605.1 --> 6611.400000000001
it can't continue like that because it's

6608.46 --> 6614.1
not gonna stop getting worse you see

6611.4 --> 6617.159
you should realize that by now just

6614.1 --> 6619.92
looking at the direct past and see the

6617.159 --> 6623.219
development curve of this horror

6619.92 --> 6627.2390000000005
it's not gonna get better it's only

6623.219 --> 6630.5
gonna get worse and so ignoring it is

6627.239 --> 6630.5
not going to be durable

6631.619 --> 6636.78
right but then what do you do you want

6634.86 --> 6639.839999999999
to get to some action well how do you do

6636.78 --> 6642.36
action that's not just okay let's get

6639.84 --> 6643.860000000001
the Torches and rakes and [ __ ] kill

6642.36 --> 6645.96
them right

6643.86 --> 6650.4
how do you

6645.96 --> 6652.9800000000005
lay that part off as much as you can

6650.4 --> 6655.699
to try to be a little bit more

6652.98 --> 6655.699
constructive

6657.719 --> 6661.56
and that's pretty difficult and I

6659.58 --> 6663.36
thought that my idea was a decent idea

6661.56 --> 6665.52
the poster idea

6663.36 --> 6667.799999999999
and it's funny because it's in an

6665.52 --> 6670.56
indirect way kind of Lent from Alex

6667.8 --> 6674.04
Jones who did that with Obama

6670.56 --> 6676.7390000000005
remember the Obama Joker posters that

6674.04 --> 6678.719
thing went round like crazy and it

6676.739 --> 6681.0599999999995
really did its job I mean didn't get him

6678.719 --> 6684.0
out of power or anything but it has

6681.06 --> 6687.3
certainly spread awareness about

6684.0 --> 6690.38
The hoax of

6687.3 --> 6690.38
of what he did

6691.5 --> 6695.84
remember all the slogans

6696.02 --> 6699.4400000000005
what was it again

6701.88 --> 6707.400000000001
hope and change but how did he said it

6704.46 --> 6709.86
in a special way again

6707.4 --> 6712.259999999999
it's kind of in my head this place with

6709.86 --> 6715.259999999999
with make America great again from Trump

6712.26 --> 6718.159000000001
but Obama used to say certain things too

6715.26 --> 6718.159000000001
what was it again

6719.34 --> 6725.1
right but that poster thing really kind

6721.739 --> 6728.099999999999
of broke the spell from Obama

6725.1 --> 6732.06
to a degree didn't completely destroy it

6728.1 --> 6735.719
but it helped and well maybe now in this

6732.06 --> 6737.580000000001
more localized where it's everywhere and

6735.719 --> 6740.04
Mayors and police Chiefs are literally

6737.58 --> 6743.96
[ __ ] up their cities by letting by

6740.04 --> 6743.96
legalizing criminal Behavior

6744.119 --> 6750.719
well maybe something similar could be

6747.36 --> 6752.639
tried to just highlight the head figures

6750.719 --> 6755.159
that are the actual cause so you don't

6752.639 --> 6757.4400000000005
stare at the criminals

6755.159 --> 6758.94
right all the time like the piece is a

6757.44 --> 6760.44
[ __ ] on the street that actually do it

6758.94 --> 6761.94
and you're like they're the fault the

6760.44 --> 6764.94
other fault no no no

6761.94 --> 6768.48
it's the people that are preventing the

6764.94 --> 6770.879999999999
police from tackling those people that

6768.48 --> 6773.759999999999
are the problem

6770.88 --> 6776.219
and that needs to be spread the

6773.76 --> 6779.9400000000005
awareness of that and you could do it by

6776.219 --> 6783.7390000000005
making the posters of those specific key

6779.94 --> 6783.739
people and spreading them everywhere

6784.02 --> 6791.0
it might help it might be an actual

6787.82 --> 6795.0599999999995
non-aggressive solution from my part hey

6791.0 --> 6797.1
so yeah please take it

6795.06 --> 6799.860000000001
I don't just want to be the guy that

6797.1 --> 6803.400000000001
says kill them all all the time I

6799.86 --> 6805.92
actually do want to attempt peaceful

6803.4 --> 6807.54
Solutions but I don't give it much

6805.92 --> 6810.08
chance but I mean that doesn't mean we

6807.54 --> 6810.08
shouldn't try

6812.159 --> 6815.839999999999
make some memes yeah sure

6821.159 --> 6824.719
oh [ __ ] slow mo

6824.76 --> 6828.179
yeah

6826.26 --> 6830.76
but I mean especially the older

6828.179 --> 6833.52
generation is gonna get it

6830.76 --> 6836.58
like they're really aiming for everybody

6833.52 --> 6837.719
that's older to [ __ ] them up

6836.58 --> 6840.78
like

6837.719 --> 6844.219
Elderly Homes they're like really doing

6840.78 --> 6844.219
their best to euthanize them

6849.48 --> 6854.218999999999
but even like the less older like

6851.58 --> 6858.36
anybody that would be

6854.219 --> 6860.28
at the pension age right

6858.36 --> 6861.599999999999
that's who they want to [ __ ] up that's

6860.28 --> 6864.0
who they want to kill because they don't

6861.6 --> 6865.679
want people to have old age with

6864.0 --> 6869.82
pensions they don't want that anymore

6865.679 --> 6871.56
they just want you to work until you die

6869.82 --> 6873.54
that's what they want the world to

6871.56 --> 6874.7390000000005
become like that's why all Pension funds

6873.54 --> 6876.84
everywhere in the world are getting

6874.739 --> 6880.44
looted

6876.84 --> 6885.02
and why old homes are the primary target

6880.44 --> 6885.0199999999995
for eugenics executions

6905.159 --> 6911.48
Obama said is great yeah but Obama's a

6908.699 --> 6915.119
[ __ ] lying bullshitter man

6911.48 --> 6917.9
he's a total poor [ __ ]

6915.119 --> 6917.9
puppet

6918.119 --> 6922.339999999999
he just talks [ __ ] all day long

6927.0 --> 6932.94
oh yeah now I remember what Obama said

6929.159 --> 6935.4
yes we can that was a stupid slogan but

6932.94 --> 6939.379999999999
it worked really well

6935.4 --> 6939.379999999999
people got so bound up by that

6941.159 --> 6946.0199999999995
