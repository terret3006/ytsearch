[Music]

262.32 --> 265.519
[Music]

265.96 --> 270.88
time I was just having a weird

268.68 --> 273.72
experience right before before I started

270.88 --> 276.479
going live here it's watching Taboo

273.72 --> 276.47900000000004
conspiracy

277.919 --> 284.79999999999995
video just to check out what he would be

282.039 --> 288.039
saying was this priest about the state

284.8 --> 290.52000000000004
of Israel and reading into it and then

288.039 --> 293.12
he started like

290.52 --> 296.15999999999997
reading like list of

293.12 --> 299.6
curses and like when he started reading

296.16 --> 302.08000000000004

312.12 --> 317.919
not feel that coming all right so I hope

315.199 --> 320.28000000000003
it's not going to be in the

317.919 --> 321.919
way but that was a weird thing that

320.28 --> 324.44
happened pretty much right before I

321.919 --> 324.44
started the

324.88 --> 331.479

669.48 --> 673.399
terrible

671.9 --> 676.48
[Music]

673.399 --> 678.839
clunky and he's always reifying the

celestials into literal

678.839 --> 685.839
positions with his arguments he's been

681.12 --> 687.72
doing that for like half a decade and I

685.839 --> 692.399
re

687.72 --> 696.519
like I literally confronted him with

692.399 --> 699.12
that almost face to face from the chat

696.519 --> 701.48
like a long time ago like he's not

699.12 --> 703.399
listening I I think he doesn't

701.48 --> 707.04
understand it at

703.399 --> 707.88
all because he just he doesn't rebut any

707.04 --> 711.48
of

707.88 --> 717.0
it he's just not

711.48 --> 717.0
listening so bad for flat Earths

717.959 --> 723.04

836.6 --> 843.6800000000001
committed sound like it's just so

840.639 --> 846.24

Show's theme from yesterday so he wasn't

or

862.44 --> 866.399
something I mean he's got to do

867.68 --> 870.68
something

875.8 --> 880.8389999999999
everyone has superpowers and he has

878.0 --> 880.839
evidence

890.199 --> 893.199
okay

897.68 --> 900.68

910.35 --> 913.59
[Music]

913.8 --> 917.88
fibs I don't get

915.36 --> 924.24
[Music]

917.88 --> 924.24
it da is a grifter well yeah I

924.86 --> 930.6
[Music]

927.6 --> 930.6
mean

932.48 --> 937.759
grifter I don't know but he he does

934.8 --> 937.7589999999999
weird things

941.56 --> 944.7099999999999
[Music]

947.759 --> 953.1990000000001
sometimes I don't know what he's doing I

950.48 --> 957.36
I just don't get

953.199 --> 959.639
it like 5 years ago I thought I kind of

957.36 --> 962.1990000000001
got what David was was doing and all

959.639 --> 965.44
that what he's doing now like

962.199 --> 967.3199999999999
I like I don't get it anymore like I

965.44 --> 970.4290000000001
don't understand what he's like

967.32 --> 970.4290000000001
[Music]

970.72 --> 977.639
doing so maybe you're right maybe it's a

973.56 --> 977.6389999999999
grifter or something I don't know man

978.36 --> 984.87
I I don't know what is

981.66 --> 984.87
[Music]

987.519 --> 990.519
happening

993.8 --> 999.4399999999999
yeah don't worry fibro you just focus on

997.199 --> 1002.3599999999999
work

999.44 --> 1004.639
then of the tribe what are you talking

1002.36 --> 1004.639
about

1013.959 --> 1021.16
clutch do you mean he's a Jew well from

1018.279 --> 1022.079
a Jewish family because as far as I know

1021.16 --> 1024.12
he's a

1022.079 --> 1027.36
Christian I

1024.12 --> 1031.039
mean unless you're saying his secretly

1027.36 --> 1033.24
acting all of it which is kind of

1031.039 --> 1036.919
paranoid like why the hell would he do

1033.24 --> 1036.919
that like even as a

1038.4 --> 1043.1200000000001
Jew that just doesn't make any sense

1045.679 --> 1053.64
really he's for business and

1049.08 --> 1058.1599999999999
what no no that that now you just

1053.64 --> 1060.7990000000002
stumbled into like the dumbest idea ever

1058.16 --> 1063.2
which is that somebody would infiltrate

1060.799 --> 1066.8799999999999
Flat

1063.2 --> 1070.0800000000002
Earth pretend to be a

1066.88 --> 1072.7600000000002
Christian to like achieve something to

1070.08 --> 1077.3999999999999
get rich like nobody becomes a flat

1072.76 --> 1080.4
earther to become rich okay that is

1077.4 --> 1080.4
ridiculous

1081.88 --> 1086.72
that's what baller trolls used to say

1084.159 --> 1086.72
absolute

1097.2 --> 1106.52
horeshit but I mean he is a business guy

1101.72 --> 1109.64
he does know how to do

1106.52 --> 1112.24
business but I mean

1109.64 --> 1114.5200000000002
it's not going to get rich of Flat Earth

1112.24 --> 1114.52
that's

1115.4 --> 1120.1200000000001
ridiculous I mean his app is like a

1117.76 --> 1122.559
success and all that and yeah that's the

1120.12 --> 1125.9599999999998
closest you could come to like some

1122.559 --> 1125.96
financial success like

1129.919 --> 1136.159
that but I mean it's obvious that David

1133.4 --> 1137.3200000000002
is doing a lot of business outside of

1136.159 --> 1140.3200000000002
Flat

1137.32 --> 1140.32
Earth

1144.0 --> 1151.0
what the hell does that mean LSG

1146.96 --> 1151.0
what hello by the way Simply

1153.64 --> 1159.3200000000002
Shredded simman Den does okay of what

1157.0 --> 1163.08
the [ __ ] are you talking about Simon Den

1159.32 --> 1165.9189999999999
is not a flat earther it's an anti flat

1163.08 --> 1168.96
and there's huge pots of

1165.919 --> 1170.76
money that people throw at anti flat

1168.96 --> 1173.64
earthers because they hate Flat Earth so

1170.76 --> 1176.28

1348.76 --> 1354.24

[Music]

1387.44 --> 1395.279
never really spoke against San what

1391.679 --> 1397.8400000000001
really multiple times I would like

1395.279 --> 1401.48
heliocentrism to still

1397.84 --> 1404.279
exist like it I well I think it would be

1401.48 --> 1406.1200000000001
kind of a waste to just have all of it

1404.279 --> 1410.4
completely

1406.12 --> 1410.3999999999999
erased I think it's a very

1410.52 --> 1416.84
entertaining tool if properly

1414.48 --> 1418.799
wielded right the problem about

1416.84 --> 1421.84
heliocentrism is that it is being

1418.799 --> 1424.32
reified into physical reality that's the

1421.84 --> 1427.8799999999999
real problem about it if you just treat

1424.32 --> 1431.84
it as a consideration as an idea it's a

1427.88 --> 1431.8400000000001
mind experiment then it's really

1436.88 --> 1439.88
cool

they deserve to have a place here like

1880.799 --> 1889.1589999999999
they think I owe them that place of

1885.039 --> 1889.1589999999999
being part of my show

1889.44 --> 1895.3990000000001
because they want to own me they want to

1893.159 --> 1898.0390000000002
use me like a puppet that's what they

1895.399 --> 1900.639
really want they're addicted and they

1898.039 --> 1902.639
can't handle that a guy despite

1900.639 --> 1904.32
everything despite his own life despite

1902.639 --> 1905.9189999999999
his own

1904.32 --> 1911.24
conditions

1905.919 --> 1911.24
refuses to be pushed

1912.519 --> 1918.039
around and basically my life situation

1916.32 --> 1921.2
is pretty much like like yeah I

1918.039 --> 1925.559
literally sacrificed absolutely

1921.2 --> 1929.8400000000001
everything to do that everything to be

1925.559 --> 1934.279
completely free and not beholden to

1929.84 --> 1938.6
anyone with my speech to any

1934.279 --> 1942.519
level you cannot make me shut up or say

1938.6 --> 1946.08
things that you want me to say yeah you

1942.519 --> 1949.08
can't and you never

1946.08 --> 1949.08
will

1951.6 --> 1958.519
I'm content to live like this until I'm

1955.799 --> 1961.279
old and

1958.519 --> 1964.159
gray without much

1961.279 --> 1968.279
changing under the condition that I can

1964.159 --> 1971.0
be absolutely free to say things exactly

1968.279 --> 1976.039
like I want to say

1971.0 --> 1979.039
them at the time that I want to say

1976.039 --> 1979.039

into that since it is in your name but I

2089.079 --> 2093.32
mean like there should be like a whole

2090.919 --> 2095.879
bunch of stock market shifts happening

2093.32 --> 2100.2000000000003
right now pretty

2095.879 --> 2103.04
big or in the middle of it or about

2100.2 --> 2105.839
to I've been hearing predictions that

2103.04 --> 2106.8
like Bitcoin gold and silver is going to

2105.839 --> 2110.0
like

2106.8 --> 2112.8
explode or not really it's rather that

2110.0 --> 2115.24
the dollar is like going to go Zimbabwe

2112.8 --> 2117.599
freefall and I mean yeah that can be

2115.24 --> 2119.72
rumors I'm definitely not somebody to

2117.599 --> 2122.119
take Financial advice from but I'm

2119.72 --> 2126.3199999999997
hearing it out

2122.119 --> 2128.88
there and hey GTI currency has literally

2126.32 --> 2133.04

weenies

2166.44 --> 2170.319
okay I didn't see

2170.359 --> 2176.119
it but it's probably YouTube's

2173.64 --> 2179.16
anti-aggression

2176.119 --> 2182.44
algorithm I mean YouTube is literally

2179.16 --> 2185.3999999999996
now Unleashed like nanny

2182.44 --> 2189.7200000000003
Bots that don't even spot words that

2185.4 --> 2192.04
just spot angry intention and then

2189.72 --> 2193.8799999999997
removes that like a freaking

2192.04 --> 2197.72
kindergarten

2193.88 --> 2197.7200000000003
teacher so that might be

2203.359 --> 2211.2

2206.88 --> 2214.1600000000003
this with the life speaking person

2211.2 --> 2216.16
unless I say something really bad and

2214.16 --> 2218.2799999999997
then I'll get a strike or something but

2216.16 --> 2222.24
I mean yeah you can't

2218.28 --> 2226.28
delete my live spoken comments now can

2222.24 --> 2228.7599999999998
you too bad I can speak out all my

2226.28 --> 2231.079
aggressive

2228.76 --> 2233.6400000000003
intent as much as I want I mean it's

2231.079 --> 2236.8
going to be my own detriment if I do it

2233.64 --> 2239.92
if I don't do it correctly

2236.8 --> 2241.96
appropriately but I can do it and that's

2239.92 --> 2244.56
called

2241.96 --> 2246.8
freedom freedom apparently you don't

2244.56 --> 2248.92
really have anymore in the YouTube chat

2246.8 --> 2250.88
because if you say something stupid

2248.92 --> 2254.3
that's kind of like aggressive or

2250.88 --> 2257.449
something YouTube now just removes

2254.3 --> 2257.449
[Music]

2268.28 --> 2273.52
that

2270.28 --> 2273.52
right hey

2275.44 --> 2279.079
Crockett get to see

2279.24 --> 2286.9599999999996
you creepy 9084 [ __ ] I don't know man

2283.88 --> 2289.04
I'm I've seen it happen before I'm just

2286.96 --> 2291.839
kind of surprised that they're trying it

2289.04 --> 2293.72
again because it was a major disaster

2291.839 --> 2296.52
last time I mean it literally makes

2293.72 --> 2296.52
people really

2303.44 --> 2310.119
confused just YouTube it three videos

2306.64 --> 2312.52
and then the video player blocked what

2310.119 --> 2312.52
what the

2313.76 --> 2319.4100000000003
[ __ ]

2316.2 --> 2321.5989999999997
really what type of videos D

2319.41 --> 2324.1299999999997
[Music]

2324.13 --> 2330.099
[Music]

2330.44 --> 2334.48
videos but that's pretty messed

2335.52 --> 2338.52
up

2342.359 --> 2350.24
ter are you talking about specific

2344.8 --> 2350.2400000000002
Indian videos or like all over the place

2356.04 --> 2360.839
international I have noticed that there

2358.2 --> 2363.319
are some videos out there that are like

2360.839 --> 2365.72
Regional and they say like this video is

2363.319 --> 2368.079
not accepted in your region so you can't

2365.72 --> 2371.2799999999997
watch it

2368.079 --> 2374.079
could do T can you just describe it

2371.28 --> 2376.6400000000003
please just describe you you can't you

2374.079 --> 2378.7200000000003
just say like hey this was the video

2376.64 --> 2381.72
this is what it was

2378.72 --> 2381.72
about

2383.72 --> 2391.8799999999997
H goodie okay YouTube does not give it

2388.4 --> 2391.88
oh well it's not blocked for

2393.4 --> 2398.4
me or this is a video about

2399.88 --> 2403.92
video

2400.92 --> 2403.92
player

2408.839 --> 2412.839
okay Jesus that's a big

2415.119 --> 2420.7200000000003
Channel never stop using ad I don't even

2417.839 --> 2423.24
use ad block and it doesn't form any

2420.72 --> 2423.24
problem with

2425.359 --> 2430.0789999999997
me but uh yeah I

2442.2 --> 2448.56
mean ter are you saying that it's the

2445.04 --> 2450.119
ads that block the video or something is

2448.56 --> 2451.7599999999998
that what you're saying is that what

2450.119 --> 2453.6400000000003
he's saying I don't know because you're

2451.76 --> 2455.88
not saying a lot you're just giving me a

2453.64 --> 2457.68
link and expecting me to understand

2455.88 --> 2460.1600000000003
everything

2457.68 --> 2462.7599999999998
then I'm not going to watch that video

2460.16 --> 2465.04
obviously since I right now having a

2462.76 --> 2465.0400000000004
live

2485.24 --> 2488.24
show

2490.04 --> 2494.64
oh that's what you're saying it's an

2493.4 --> 2497.28
anti-ad

2494.64 --> 2498.8799999999997
blocker okay fair

2497.28 --> 2502.88
enough

2498.88 --> 2506.2000000000003
hey YouTube has the absolute logical

2502.88 --> 2508.28
right to do that I mean where the hell

2506.2 --> 2511.52
do you think YouTube is getting its

2508.28 --> 2515.0
maintenance from on average it's from

2511.52 --> 2517.7599999999998
ads if they're going to make a maneuver

2515.0 --> 2521.52
to try to un do or

2517.76 --> 2524.3590000000004
counterterm counteract against ad

2521.52 --> 2527.28
blocking yeah I mean what the hell would

2524.359 --> 2532.319
you expect like oh but that's so

2527.28 --> 2535.119
inconvenient yeah well too [ __ ] bad

2532.319 --> 2539.04
yeah they got bills

2535.119 --> 2542.2000000000003
too they need the stupid ads to to make

2539.04 --> 2544.04
sure they don't make a gigantic loss

2542.2 --> 2547.24
which they typically would because

2544.04 --> 2549.68
YouTube uses a lot of bandwidth on

2547.24 --> 2552.4799999999996
average I mean it's a miracle that

2549.68 --> 2556.0
YouTube even

2552.48 --> 2556.0
exists it really

2558.68 --> 2563.96
is if there were no ads it would make

2561.64 --> 2568.5989999999997
like insane

2563.96 --> 2573.68
losses so yeah I'm not against that at

2568.599 --> 2576.52
all i' almost applaud it it's like yeah

2573.68 --> 2580.1189999999997
yeah kick those ad blockers off yeah oh

2576.52 --> 2582.319
it was all so nice so easy yeah yeah but

2580.119 --> 2585.28
it's literally ruining YouTube when you

2582.319 --> 2587.7599999999998
do that enough for them to make a

2585.28 --> 2591.4
maneuver now to kick you off when you

2587.76 --> 2593.8
use it so yeah I kind of applaud that I

2591.4 --> 2595.1600000000003
don't use ad blocker I will never have

2593.8 --> 2597.319
this issue

2595.16 --> 2600.7599999999998
then

2597.319 --> 2603.839
good I want YouTube to be stable and

2600.76 --> 2607.0400000000004
secure financially so that it will

2603.839 --> 2610.0
continue to exist and not EV go so

2607.04 --> 2612.68
bankrupt it's like oh yeah we're just

2610.0 --> 2614.68
deleting everything because we can't

2612.68 --> 2617.5989999999997
afford it anymore and we're bankrupt

2614.68 --> 2621.0
yeah would do you want that you want

2617.599 --> 2625.079
YouTube to just like oh well we're

2621.0 --> 2627.839
totally bankrupt delete all the videos

2625.079 --> 2627.8390000000004
is that what you

2630.2 --> 2634.52
want if I used ad blocker I would say

2633.76 --> 2637.559
the

2634.52 --> 2639.359
opposite yeah but I don't use ad blocker

2637.559 --> 2641.88
specifically because of the before

2639.359 --> 2641.88
mentioned

2649.079 --> 2654.92
reasons and I already give the luxury

2652.2 --> 2657.72
with the ads on my channel which they do

2654.92 --> 2660.92
have yeah there are ads on my channel

2657.72 --> 2662.5989999999997
and I specifically choose that they

2660.92 --> 2665.64
always are

2662.599 --> 2669.6400000000003
skippable always skippable you will

2665.64 --> 2671.2799999999997
never see an ad on my channel that lasts

2669.64 --> 2676.16
more than 5

2671.28 --> 2678.6800000000003
seconds I swear it is that so terrible

2676.16 --> 2681.16
yeah I wouldn't want to watch like 15 or

2678.68 --> 2683.68
20 second stupid ads about some

2681.16 --> 2686.3999999999996
disgusting alcohol that you can't skip

2683.68 --> 2690.1189999999997
yeah I get it that's why they're all

2686.4 --> 2694.0
skippable 5c skippable

2690.119 --> 2694.96
ads it's not a big deal dude it's not a

2694.0 --> 2697.68
big

2694.96 --> 2700.0
deal

2697.68 --> 2703.9199999999996
I don't like ads either but I like it

2700.0 --> 2707.68
even less when something just shuts down

2703.92 --> 2710.92
entirely because it can't pay for the

2707.68 --> 2712.0099999999998
bandwidth anymore yeah that's what I

2710.92 --> 2715.149
really

2712.01 --> 2715.1490000000003
[Music]

2721.2 --> 2727.7999999999997
dislike so I just don't use ad

2724.359 --> 2730.44
locker hey and if a video is completely

2727.8 --> 2732.3590000000004
Chuck full with ads so much that it

2730.44 --> 2733.079
really makes it disruptive you know what

2732.359 --> 2737.92
I

2733.079 --> 2740.7200000000003
do I say [ __ ] you and I don't watch the

2737.92 --> 2742.88
video because it's too many ads it's

2740.72 --> 2746.359
it's annoying

2742.88 --> 2749.48
yeah it's yeah when people overdo it

2746.359 --> 2753.48
it's just oh oh oh well then I just

2749.48 --> 2755.0
don't watch the video then [ __ ] you then

2753.48 --> 2757.2400000000002
you're going to shove like 10

2755.0 --> 2760.92
advertisements down my throat during one

2757.24 --> 2762.8799999999997
15minute video well [ __ ] you then I'm

2760.92 --> 2766.04
just not going to watch your

2762.88 --> 2766.04
video you

2766.43 --> 2769.62
[Music]

2769.839 --> 2773.839
know it's too many ads well then I'm

2772.52 --> 2777.839
just going to watch something else that

2773.839 --> 2777.839
doesn't have too many ads it's that

2784.8 --> 2787.8
simple

2789.4 --> 2794.6800000000003
oh hello

2791.64 --> 2797.68
me holy [ __ ] that's an old

2794.68 --> 2797.68
account

2800.319 --> 2807.319
2007 it's a fine balancing art between

2803.8 --> 2810.3590000000004
content and ads yeah and it doesn't make

2807.319 --> 2810.359
an ads less

2810.68 --> 2820.2
annoying but the point is that without

2815.839 --> 2824.04
out the ads it all goes away

2820.2 --> 2827.16
yeah I mean hey would you like the

2824.04 --> 2830.5589999999997
alternative of like oh no no you just

2827.16 --> 2832.68
have to pay to have a YouTube account to

2830.559 --> 2834.2000000000003
be able to watch YouTube videos is that

2832.68 --> 2836.319
what you

2834.2 --> 2839.16
want like

2836.319 --> 2842.24
Rockin is that what you just want that

2839.16 --> 2845.2
because you hate the ads so much that

2842.24 --> 2848.5589999999997
you'd rather just give a standard

2845.2 --> 2850.5589999999997
payment on a monthly basis to just be

2848.559 --> 2853.2000000000003
able to watch any YouTube

2850.559 --> 2855.559
video yeah that would be the only other

2853.2 --> 2858.0789999999997
viable solution if they absolutely

2855.559 --> 2861.3590000000004
excluded ads from being part of YouTube

2858.079 --> 2864.319
yeah you know what it would also do

2861.359 --> 2866.2799999999997
dramatically cut down on viewers

2864.319 --> 2868.72
dramatically it would make the whole

2866.28 --> 2873.76
[ __ ] thing collapse because the vast

2868.72 --> 2879.0789999999997
majority of YouTube viewers don't pay or

2873.76 --> 2881.6400000000003
they can't pay so you choose

2879.079 --> 2884.76
teret yeah good buy a premium that's

2881.64 --> 2887.359
right so it's already there it's B the

2884.76 --> 2889.1600000000003
option is basically already there you

2887.359 --> 2891.68
could go buy

2889.16 --> 2895.7599999999998
premium and then you don't have the

2891.68 --> 2895.7599999999998
ads and that would be a fair

2900.24 --> 2903.4599999999996
[Music]

2904.64 --> 2907.64
deal

2908.599 --> 2912.52
they give you free trials yeah I know

2910.359 --> 2915.72
they're continually like offering it to

2912.52 --> 2915.72
me I'm not taking it

2916.079 --> 2922.04
though I don't take anything I don't

2919.24 --> 2924.0
need anything I don't need oh free

2922.04 --> 2926.16
temporary upgrades oh it can grade it up

2924.0 --> 2929.24
so it just grades down again and it

2926.16 --> 2931.359
starts whining on my at my ass and

2929.24 --> 2934.5589999999997
through email continue like oh are you

2931.359 --> 2938.0789999999997
sure you didn't want to [ __ ] off I'm not

2934.559 --> 2940.0
GNA pay for it and that's that I'll

2938.079 --> 2942.3590000000004
watch the stupid

2940.0 --> 2945.41
ads and if there's too many of them I

2942.359 --> 2948.61
will not watch the video and that's

2945.41 --> 2948.6099999999997
[Music]

2955.839 --> 2961.0789999999997
that right d so yeah I am totally giving

2960.119 --> 2965.799
it to

2961.079 --> 2969.119
them I'm saying yes YouTube I'm with you

2965.799 --> 2970.359
I agree with YouTube I'm on their side

2969.119 --> 2974.319
in

2970.359 --> 2978.119
this good I'm glad you're you finally

2974.319 --> 2979.839
managed to break the ad blocker the

2978.119 --> 2982.92
illegal ad

2979.839 --> 2986.04
blocker I'm

2982.92 --> 2989.359
glad cuz it was a

2986.04 --> 2991.92
manace it was a cheap ass hack that only

2989.359 --> 2991.92
created

2994.52 --> 2997.52
losses

3004.32 --> 3007.53
[Music]

3012.64 --> 3016.359
you'd be pissed if you used that yeah

3014.44 --> 3018.839
yeah that's why you shouldn't be using

3016.359 --> 3022.319
ad blocker always and getting

3018.839 --> 3025.64
spoiled yeah oh I don't have a hassle

3022.319 --> 3029.72
all for free oh now you're going to just

3025.64 --> 3035.04
expect the thing that's basically

3029.72 --> 3038.24
illegal oh but but my luxury it was so

3035.04 --> 3040.4
easy my luxury that I shouldn't I didn't

3038.24 --> 3043.8799999999997
actually deserve and weren't supposed to

3040.4 --> 3046.559
use was so easy luxury right it's like

3043.88 --> 3049.48
me complaining about damn it Pirate Bay

3046.559 --> 3053.1600000000003
is down how dare they make it difficult

3049.48 --> 3057.16
to reach Pirate Bay when I'm used to

3053.16 --> 3059.72
ille technically illegally download

3057.16 --> 3063.1189999999997
videos and

3059.72 --> 3066.0789999999997
games man I'm so angry that they got

3063.119 --> 3070.559
after them like no I totally get it I'm

3066.079 --> 3072.7200000000003
very glad it's there though because it's

3070.559 --> 3074.92
not like a blocking tool it's actually

3072.72 --> 3076.9599999999996
makes things available for me that I

3074.92 --> 3079.599
literally would never be able to have

3076.96 --> 3082.319
because I couldn't pay for it or simply

3079.599 --> 3084.76
not reliable enough when you buy

3082.319 --> 3088.52
something well when you get a hacked

3084.76 --> 3092.559
product it's already fully updated and

3088.52 --> 3094.92
tested so that it's actually a safer

3092.559 --> 3099.3190000000004
product than when you buy it from the

3094.92 --> 3101.04
store yeah yeah yeah they don't tell you

3099.319 --> 3103.7599999999998
that

3101.04 --> 3106.04
so it's slightly different but the point

3103.76 --> 3109.6400000000003
is I'm not going to complain that

3106.04 --> 3109.64
they're trying to go after

3109.88 --> 3116.92
them like how dare they do that it's

3114.04 --> 3120.24
like a [ __ ] it was such a great thing

3116.92 --> 3123.04
for me but I mean ad blocker is like

3120.24 --> 3126.2
yeah you're just a spoiled Brad I'm

3123.04 --> 3129.7599999999998
sorry oh they they crack down your near

3126.2 --> 3131.68
illegal trick oh do I have to be angry

3129.76 --> 3136.0
now for you because they crack down on

3131.68 --> 3137.96
your illegal trick no I saw that coming

3136.0 --> 3141.28
a mile

3137.96 --> 3144.2
away so it's your problem you got used

3141.28 --> 3147.0
to that luxury that you really didn't

3144.2 --> 3150.04
actually deserve

3147.0 --> 3150.04
and now it's going to go

3150.16 --> 3153.79
[Music]

3156.559 --> 3162.3190000000004
away how about downloading pirate movie

3159.16 --> 3165.8799999999997
I just talked about that o I literally

3162.319 --> 3168.319
fully just addressed that like not even

3165.88 --> 3168.319
a minute

3170.359 --> 3178.799
ago and it is slightly

3174.24 --> 3181.2
different because Pirate Bay actually is

3178.799 --> 3181.2
about

3182.68 --> 3190.319
availability and there is an advancement

3186.599 --> 3193.6800000000003
component to availability you see even

3190.319 --> 3197.64
through three download because products

3193.68 --> 3200.9199999999996
spread become more easily

3197.64 --> 3204.16
known and good products will

3200.92 --> 3206.839
be more quickly

3204.16 --> 3209.52
recognized

3206.839 --> 3212.5589999999997
so it's different than when it's an ad

3209.52 --> 3215.319
blocker because ad blocking is pure

3212.559 --> 3218.599
convenience for The Watcher and pure

3215.319 --> 3220.68
financial detriment and nothing else for

3218.599 --> 3224.559
for the company that's doing it that's

3220.68 --> 3227.72
all or Pirate Bay and all that giving

3224.559 --> 3230.7900000000004
availability to download products

3227.72 --> 3233.72
actually helps spread those

3230.79 --> 3238.0
[Music]

3233.72 --> 3241.3999999999996
products and become more widely tested

3238.0 --> 3242.72
Etc so there is an actual advantage to

3241.4 --> 3245.48
having that

3242.72 --> 3246.9599999999996
around that I mean the the copyright

3245.48 --> 3249.2
companies are not going to agree they

3246.96 --> 3251.839
are going to like be legally obligated

3249.2 --> 3254.64
to try to fight it off right because

3251.839 --> 3258.319
that's literally their Turf that's their

3254.64 --> 3260.8799999999997
Turf but there is an industrial

3258.319 --> 3264.2799999999997
advancement to having products

3260.88 --> 3267.599
downloadable for free because it spreads

3264.28 --> 3269.559
better and spread is very important for

3267.599 --> 3273.04
software and

3269.559 --> 3273.0400000000004
games that is

3273.72 --> 3281.2799999999997
known right when products crack down too

3278.64 --> 3283.799
hard on their security they become

3281.28 --> 3285.8390000000004
infamous because of it and it's actually

3283.799 --> 3288.599
a detriment to the product on the long

3285.839 --> 3290.799
run you see so why they don't do it as

3288.599 --> 3294.319
badly anymore they used to crack down

3290.799 --> 3295.92
super hard like especially around 2010

3294.319 --> 3299.44
in that era

3295.92 --> 3301.44
so hard and it was all negative it all

3299.44 --> 3303.799
bad for them so they stopped doing it

3301.44 --> 3307.079
like that and they

3303.799 --> 3310.44
should because if you just

3307.079 --> 3314.3590000000004
allow products to spread even for free

3310.44 --> 3318.48
they collect more

3314.359 --> 3321.4
Fame people know about it

3318.48 --> 3323.76
better and hey if people are like you

3321.4 --> 3326.079
have like like a Photoshop an old

3323.76 --> 3328.1600000000003
Photoshop that's techn you can legally

3326.079 --> 3331.52
download that because it's so

3328.16 --> 3333.24
old well because of that people will use

3331.52 --> 3335.2
Photoshop and if they then go

3333.24 --> 3337.4799999999996
professional they will definitely

3335.2 --> 3342.0
consider buying a professional modern

3337.48 --> 3345.68
version of it right so because the old

3342.0 --> 3348.48
Photoshop was freely downloadable people

3345.68 --> 3352.2
could get to know it learn about it get

3348.48 --> 3354.839
good at it like it and then eventually

3352.2 --> 3358.48
when they go professional because of all

3354.839 --> 3360.96
that that they chose to buy the official

3358.48 --> 3363.64
version so it's actually in their

3360.96 --> 3363.64
benefit you

3366.2 --> 3373.16
see but that doesn't count that entire

3369.359 --> 3375.52
system that Loop like the spread loop

3373.16 --> 3379.92
with pirating is not the same with ad

3375.52 --> 3383.4
blocking because there is literally no

3379.92 --> 3387.44
Advantage for the industry at all when

3383.4 --> 3390.44
ad blocking is used no Advantage at all

3387.44 --> 3392.48
so yeah I com I think it's good I think

3390.44 --> 3395.64
it's good they're cracking down on

3392.48 --> 3395.64
it they

3397.4 --> 3404.2000000000003
should if you really think it's so

3399.76 --> 3404.2000000000003
important then buy YouTu

3408.359 --> 3413.359
premium all right

3410.599 --> 3416.3590000000004
anyway that was quite a

3413.359 --> 3418.38
rant but I'm I'm glad that it came up

3416.359 --> 3421.59
because this all needs to be

3418.38 --> 3421.59
[Music]

3432.78 --> 3435.9990000000003
[Music]

3443.799 --> 3446.799
said

3450.0 --> 3452.48
clear

3453.319 --> 3461.16
history right so removing the cookies

3456.319 --> 3461.16
basically solves the issue of the video

3462.599 --> 3466.6800000000003
blocking remove it and

3467.44 --> 3470.44
reinstall

3473.799 --> 3481.4
okay right well you guys can hold back

3477.4 --> 3484.2400000000002
on on the tips on how to bypass the new

3481.4 --> 3487.2000000000003
security

3484.24 --> 3490.2799999999997
yeah you can use another place to

3487.2 --> 3494.2
communicate how to bypass it

3490.28 --> 3494.2000000000003
again because I don't want you

3502.4 --> 3509.119
to skip ads after 5 Seconds better

3505.599 --> 3509.119
that's right totally

3511.119 --> 3515.96
agree see see it's all worth

3517.48 --> 3525.319
it get a few and I mean I

3521.44 --> 3528.839
get you accepting it gives

3525.319 --> 3531.799
me like some money too I mean you don't

3528.839 --> 3533.16
might not realize it but I get some For

3531.799 --> 3536.52
Those

3533.16 --> 3539.839
ads so you watching through stupid 5

3536.52 --> 3542.68
Seconds of some idiot oh we're so we're

3539.839 --> 3545.64
so woke yeah yeah well that actually

3542.68 --> 3548.7599999999998
gives me money and you can skip it after

3545.64 --> 3548.7599999999998
5 seconds

3555.119 --> 3560.6800000000003
so and YouTube doesn't like it by the

3557.839 --> 3563.0389999999998
way that I do that it's always giving

3560.68 --> 3566.48
like this suggestion bar in the YouTube

3563.039 --> 3570.039
Studio like you you can just let YouTube

3566.48 --> 3573.52
handle it we do it better it's like and

3570.039 --> 3577.7200000000003
it's been saying that because I click

3573.52 --> 3580.839
off the like un Unstoppable

3577.72 --> 3584.72
ads it doesn't like that I do that it

3580.839 --> 3588.7599999999998
want you to sit through 20 to 30 seconds

3584.72 --> 3591.2799999999997
of some stupid drunk ass alcohol ad oh

3588.76 --> 3594.4
so great this latest

3591.28 --> 3597.96
liquor they want that so they're trying

3594.4 --> 3602.799
to manipulate me in stopping to do that

3597.96 --> 3602.799
cuz they don't want me to have ads like

3604.0 --> 3608.52
that but hey I can choose to do it the

3606.92 --> 3609.88
way I want to do it and this is the way

3608.52 --> 3612.68
I want to do

3609.88 --> 3616.7200000000003
it all my ads are

3612.68 --> 3619.319
skippable which is very doable it's a

3616.72 --> 3622.8799999999997
minor nuisance I mean you can barely

3619.319 --> 3625.799
compare this with the nuisance that we

3622.88 --> 3627.4
knew from the television remember that

3625.799 --> 3630.799
remember the

3627.4 --> 3633.799
five minute ad

3630.799 --> 3636.96
blocks block of AD in between your

3633.799 --> 3639.079
series that you literally can't do

3636.96 --> 3641.599
anything about you can like take a

3639.079 --> 3643.96
toilet break or

3641.599 --> 3647.28
something because you can't skip any of

3643.96 --> 3650.16
it and it's like it's not one freaking

3647.28 --> 3655.4
ad it's like

3650.16 --> 3658.799
six or eight and they last minutes

3655.4 --> 3661.1600000000003
yeah remember that I think that with a

3658.799 --> 3663.0389999999998
5-second skippable ad we've got it

3661.16 --> 3666.52
pretty damn good

3663.039 --> 3666.5200000000004
here I really

3673.59 --> 3676.76
[Music]

3683.44 --> 3688.48

3691.72 --> 3695.1699999999996
[Music]

3695.44 --> 3706.16

3699.68 --> 3709.839
though at all I mean guys I've got like

3706.16 --> 3713.44
1766 videos and they are all with

3709.839 --> 3716.119
ads and I barely get

3713.44 --> 3717.88
anything

3716.119 --> 3720.52
with all of

3717.88 --> 3722.92
that and people still watch my older

3720.52 --> 3727.72
videos and they still get those ads and

3722.92 --> 3727.7200000000003
it's just even with that it's barely

3731.799 --> 3738.4
anything after the video ends are the

3734.039 --> 3738.4
most irritating yeah usually

3742.16 --> 3746.359
yeah I agree

3747.52 --> 3751.359

3749.079 --> 3753.96

3916.76 --> 3920.039
times [ __ ]

3923.079 --> 3927.4
sake

3925.2 --> 3931.5989999999997
twitch got ads now too all those

3927.4 --> 3938.0
platforms will get ads all of

3931.599 --> 3938.0
them there is no videos without

3939.68 --> 3947.839
ads it isn't it's not going to

3944.079 --> 3951.48
exist yeah television had ads for a

3947.839 --> 3955.359
reason YouTube has ads for a

3951.48 --> 3958.48
reason if you want something to to stay

3955.359 --> 3962.48
it's going to get

3958.48 --> 3962.48
ads and that's

3964.96 --> 3970.68
that right unless there's like a literal

3967.88 --> 3973.039
in video sponsored thing which is

3970.68 --> 3975.52
literally also an ad so there will be

3973.039 --> 3978.119
ads and that's just that you got to get

3975.52 --> 3981.7599999999998
over it yeah you don't want ads well

3978.119 --> 3984.6400000000003
turn off your freaking screen then

3984.64 --> 3991.41
your [ __ ] life get used to it you

3987.279 --> 3998.929
want a screen you get an ad deal with

[Music]

4003.279 --> 4011.31

4007.1 --> 4011.31
[Music]

4011.92 --> 4018.559
okay whatever crap he SS yeah well he

4015.799 --> 4021.359
Alex Jones is Justified in continually

4018.559 --> 4023.0
advertising the crap he sells which is

4021.359 --> 4024.2
not crap at all they're actually really

4023.0 --> 4028.359
good

4024.2 --> 4030.1099999999997
products yeah yeah it does justify it

4028.359 --> 4033.3289999999997
literally

4030.11 --> 4033.329
[Music]

4042.319 --> 4048.319
does yeah if didn't do that there

4045.92 --> 4051.319
wouldn't be an infow Wars do you

4048.319 --> 4053.72
understand that teret literally there

4051.319 --> 4057.24
literally would not be an infow Wars if

4053.72 --> 4059.799
he didn't have those whiny Naggy

4057.24 --> 4061.9199999999996
ads which to be fair they're not even

4059.799 --> 4064.7599999999998
that bad the problem really is that you

4061.92 --> 4067.64
get them shoved in your face all the

4064.76 --> 4070.92
time I mean the amount of ads on infow

4067.64 --> 4073.16
Wars is like brutal it's worse than old

4070.92 --> 4074.64
American television in that sense it's

4073.16 --> 4076.3999999999996
worse

4074.64 --> 4077.64
but the ads in themselves they're not

4076.4 --> 4080.7200000000003
even that

4077.64 --> 4083.44
bad they're they got good music quality

4080.72 --> 4086.359
and all that for their ads and I mean

4083.44 --> 4089.119
the products themselves are good they

4086.359 --> 4090.92
are it's just a fact deal with it you

4089.119 --> 4093.48
don't like it you don't have to like it

4090.92 --> 4095.44
their products are good and they're not

4093.48 --> 4098.08
overly expensive

4095.44 --> 4100.6
either and that's just a fact you don't

4098.08 --> 4100.6
have to like

4101.56 --> 4106.6
it Alex J still yeah yeah he looks like

4104.6 --> 4110.120000000001
Baron har Conan right

4106.6 --> 4112.400000000001
now from the newer version he completely

4110.12 --> 4114.159
shaved himself in supposed protest

4112.4 --> 4117.3589999999995
against nuclear war and he literally

4114.159 --> 4118.679
looks like a toad or Baron har Conan but

4117.359 --> 4121.359
I

4118.679 --> 4125.08
mean it's kind of

4121.359 --> 4126.0
cool it's just like yes Baron what do we

4135.64 --> 4140.279
mean yes he's still around and he's

4138.159 --> 4143.0
still doing his thing and he's still

4140.279 --> 4146.4400000000005
Shilling for the not so obvious

4143.0 --> 4150.25
establishment like nobody else's

4146.44 --> 4153.449

4177.359 --> 4183.759
doing that I

4179.92 --> 4186.4400000000005
mean it's not that bad even he's just

4183.759 --> 4188.839
giving you a lot of bad options when it

4186.44 --> 4191.159
comes to

4188.839 --> 4192.88
politicians and it's weird how he does

4191.159 --> 4197.199
he says that he does that because he

4192.88 --> 4197.1990000000005
wants all decides to be known and

4197.8 --> 4202.679
heard and technically he is doing

4224.56 --> 4229.159000000001
time I've changed in such an amount of

4232.36 --> 4239.4
time he had a lot more just pushing

4235.52 --> 4242.64
force behind him back then youthful

4239.4 --> 4245.12
force and he's now really just a

4242.64 --> 4248.0
business guy that just arranges things

4245.12 --> 4250.679
and like gets system set up that's and

4248.0 --> 4253.84

4542.12 --> 4546.8
cool I always wanted to say that now

4544.28 --> 4546.8
it's in the

4549.12 --> 4555.76
title Alex Jones Baron meet ball AR

4553.48 --> 4558.08
Conan I think that's a pretty good title

4555.76 --> 4561.639
I think he'd actually appreciate that

4558.08 --> 4565.48
he's called himself a meatball by the

4561.639 --> 4567.1990000000005
way now of course om Benjamin started

4565.48 --> 4569.759999999999
that as far as I know he might have

4567.199 --> 4572.08
gotten it from somebody else out there

4569.76 --> 4574.4400000000005
whatever but I mean he calls himself the

4572.08 --> 4577.6
meatball and I bet that he'd love

4574.44 --> 4579.678999999999
playing a role as Baron Haren I mean he

4577.6 --> 4582.400000000001
could literally do that he could like

4579.679 --> 4584.1990000000005
put himself Alex Jones in a harness and

4582.4 --> 4585.719
then have him FL around like Baron

4584.199 --> 4588.678999999999
harode and

4585.719 --> 4592.719
like I mean that would be [ __ ]

4588.679 --> 4595.92
amazing I would be like yes yes that is

4592.719 --> 4599.76
so freaking hilarious and

4595.92 --> 4603.159
cool to see Alex Jones like Baron harod

4599.76 --> 4606.639

4626.6 --> 4631.360000000001
he's got to do

4628.04 --> 4633.76
it I hope he does it now at least the

4631.36 --> 4637.12
title is out there and maybe he will do

4633.76 --> 4637.12
it that would be really

4639.44 --> 4646.638999999999
cool if he's going to do it then I could

4642.6 --> 4649.76
I could technically say hey I call it I

4646.639 --> 4652.4800000000005
gave Alex Jones that idea and who

4649.76 --> 4654.4400000000005

4950.12 --> 4954.88
tappy suddenly get it wrong yesterday it

4952.36 --> 4954.88
makes no

4958.199 --> 4962.96
sense did get weird after that stream

4960.96 --> 4965.32
where he did say his sister's gone

4962.96 --> 4969.08
missing what you think that they're

4965.32 --> 4972.4
literally holding his sister

4969.08 --> 4974.679
hostage it's like you have to be a you

4972.4 --> 4976.638999999999
have have to ruin your flat Earth now or

4974.679 --> 4979.639
we're going

4976.639 --> 4982.4400000000005
to we going to bury your sister alive or

4979.639 --> 4984.76
something like that you think that's

4982.44 --> 4984.759999999999
pretty

4990.639 --> 4995.719
dramatic has he said anything about his

4993.28 --> 4995.719
missing

4998.32 --> 5003.719
sister I I'm more Curious has I mean

5001.08 --> 5006.679
since he has gotten has he actually said

5003.719 --> 5008.84
anything about her on any stream to

5006.679 --> 5011.76
anybody or in a

5008.84 --> 5015.08
chat ever said what actually happened if

5011.76 --> 5015.08
she's found what's going

5027.28 --> 5034.48
on my show should start 1 hour earlier

5030.8 --> 5034.4800000000005
no it shouldn't that's

5036.12 --> 5041.719
nonsense and besides I'm usually late

5039.44 --> 5044.638999999999
these days so definitely shouldn't start

5041.719 --> 5047.2390000000005
earlier now you start earlier when the

5044.639 --> 5050.159000000001
summer arrives when the days become

5047.239 --> 5052.599999999999
longer the Morning Becomes earlier then

5050.159 --> 5053.839999999999
you go back an hour now it's winter so

5052.6 --> 5057.679
day becomes

5053.84 --> 5059.679
shorter the Morning Becomes later cuz

5057.679 --> 5061.92
it's darker

5059.679 --> 5063.76
longer that's how it works that's the

5061.92 --> 5065.6
logic behind it that's why there is a

fine it's not complete yet I it doesn't

5198.96 --> 5204.08
have a standard I had to order the

5201.239 --> 5204.919999999999
standard because it literally has no

5204.08 --> 5209.84
back

5204.92 --> 5211.2390000000005
thing and that standard is costly but it

5209.84 --> 5214.56
will be worth it because it's going to

5211.239 --> 5218.04
be a very good one that's going to make

5214.56 --> 5218.04
