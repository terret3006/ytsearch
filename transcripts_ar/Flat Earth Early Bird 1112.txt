116.579 --> 124.86
really the overall was pleasant today it

119.939 --> 126.83999999999999
seems kind of like gray soup and Misty

124.86 --> 130.259
it did warm up

126.84 --> 133.62
because it was freezing yesterday

130.259 --> 136.45899999999997
and yeah everything is unfrozen

133.62 --> 136.459
overnight

136.56 --> 139.64000000000001
and yeah

140.099 --> 145.26
I went out for groceries before the show

143.04 --> 146.57999999999998
also a reason why I'm a little late this

145.26 --> 148.879
time

146.58 --> 152.239
because I did go to bed like super early

148.879 --> 152.239
one o'clock

153.9 --> 156.92000000000002
because I didn't need it

foreign

161.76 --> 166.2

163.14 --> 168.599
so I had a Christmas dinner yesterday

166.2 --> 172.319
over at my dad's

168.599 --> 175.379
and it was amazing

172.319 --> 179.17999999999998
I felt really good and everybody felt

175.379 --> 179.17999999999998
really good and we were all just

179.64 --> 184.44
in tune

181.26 --> 185.94
with one another and

184.44 --> 188.28
yeah

185.94 --> 189.959
like I didn't like Get over stressed or

188.28 --> 193.2
anything like last year I did get a bit

189.959 --> 196.739
overstressed it typically happens but

193.2 --> 197.879
this year no I was just completely

196.739 --> 200.659
fine

197.879 --> 200.659
calm

204.78 --> 210.72
so yeah I had a great time dinner was

207.18 --> 214.98000000000002
delicious we had like a

210.72 --> 217.94
wild dish with with actual hunted deer

214.98 --> 217.94
and hair

219.9 --> 226.68
and like this yeah I don't even whinish

223.44 --> 229.56
cooked sauce typical hunting stuff and

226.68 --> 230.459
yeah something I've read I rarely eat

229.56 --> 232.86
that

230.459 --> 235.379
but it was delicious

232.86 --> 237.48000000000002
and yeah my body was like hey that's

235.379 --> 241.26
something

237.48 --> 243.29899999999998

a lot

243.299 --> 246.08

288.479 --> 291.78
about it

290.34 --> 294.0
and yeah

291.78 --> 296.69899999999996
yesterday I wouldn't have had time to do

294.0 --> 299.16
a show basically I wouldn't have

296.699 --> 302.479
so

299.16 --> 302.47900000000004
but I'm back today

308.82 --> 315.65999999999997

397.8 --> 402.479
watch anything anyway

399.78 --> 404.94
so yeah

402.479 --> 407.59999999999997
don't really have super much to talk

404.94 --> 407.6
about today

411.9 --> 417.06
although yeah I could still make like

413.88 --> 419.539
mention of uh flatter day night flatter

417.06 --> 422.16
Day Christmas Eve

419.539 --> 425.9
of red Martin lead because I did watch

422.16 --> 425.90000000000003
that on Saturday that was a lot of fun

429.36 --> 436.16
but yeah other than that no

432.0 --> 436.16
kind of laid off the media a bit

449.28 --> 452.23999999999995
where is everybody

467.759 --> 470.47900000000004

475.62 --> 482.039
Stream Christmas stream as well which

479.099 --> 485.0
was hilarious as far as I've gotten

482.039 --> 485.0
which is like an hour

494.4 --> 499.5
the anti-flers are officially off the

496.86 --> 502.86
rails officially okay

499.5 --> 505.58
well they have been kind of for a while

502.86 --> 505.58000000000004

556.92 --> 559.04
thank you

592.8 --> 596.76
what

594.959 --> 598.6199999999999
okay

596.76 --> 601.519
I was just browsing around and

598.62 --> 601.519
apparently somebody

603.66 --> 608.3
tried to assassinate the Queen of

606.06 --> 608.3
England

609.899 --> 616.56
this Christmas like what the [ __ ]

614.16 --> 618.86
could be all just a giant setup though

616.56 --> 618.8599999999999
but

621.18 --> 625.04
the Indian sick guide

635.399 --> 641.76
okay that literally just bumped into it

638.459 --> 644.5999999999999
so weird though

641.76 --> 644.6
mm-hmm

645.2 --> 649.519
hey wrath good to see you

663.36 --> 666.38
hello clutch

681.42 --> 684.019
foreign

691.579 --> 696.959
of nonsense yeah well that's Flat Earth

694.62 --> 699.5600000000001
there's for you it's been like that for

696.959 --> 699.56
a while really

703.019 --> 706.399
hey Mike zidinich

760.019 --> 762.92
hmm

794.519 --> 799.74
huh

796.56 --> 804.0189999999999
oh just bumped into something else

799.74 --> 804.019
which seems interesting as well

805.26 --> 811.16
huh

807.48 --> 811.16
with a crossbow yeah crazy

852.42 --> 855.079
ah

878.959 --> 885.779
right so guys how was your uh Christmas

883.079 --> 889.2199999999999
weekend and all that

885.779 --> 889.22
hope you all enjoyed it

890.22 --> 896.9590000000001
probably a bit tired from like family

893.88 --> 896.959
stuff and all that

898.5 --> 903.62
like I'm not particularly tired because

900.72 --> 903.62
of that but

904.5 --> 910.079
I'm just

906.66 --> 913.26
tough to start up today again

910.079 --> 916.2199999999999
despite going really bit early to bed

913.26 --> 916.22
it's weird

917.519 --> 922.98
right also by the way I gotta

920.579 --> 926.2399999999999
giant amount of supplements from my

922.98 --> 926.24
stepmom amazing

931.8 --> 934.88
all this

936.959 --> 940.5189999999999
like fish oil

941.04 --> 947.88
vitamin C

943.1 --> 950.66
astaxentine it's like expensive as [ __ ]

947.88 --> 950.66
and

950.82 --> 955.44
and a bunch of other stuff I'm not

953.339 --> 957.72
particularly familiar with but

955.44 --> 961.1
interesting

957.72 --> 964.139
bone food

961.1 --> 967.8000000000001
multivitamin and immune energy isn't so

964.139 --> 972.019
much mushroom based so yeah well she

967.8 --> 972.019
basically deals in these supplements

973.019 --> 980.12
and she kind of likes to play Santa

976.32 --> 980.12
I'm really happy with that

993.12 --> 998.759
big baiting Glovers at this point is

995.579 --> 1003.019
ineffectual campaign not worthy of your

998.759 --> 1006.22
time as enlightening individ right

1003.019 --> 1006.22
well look

1006.5 --> 1011.66
the Ballers is what I'm saying the

1009.38 --> 1014.18
anti-flat earthers are going more and

1011.66 --> 1016.639
more towards the

1014.18 --> 1020.12
CNN frequency

1016.639 --> 1022.5790000000001
and yeah it's absolutely no use debating

1020.12 --> 1024.26
CNN if you even get the chance

1022.579 --> 1027.819
if you know what I mean

1024.26 --> 1027.819
so that makes perfect sense

1032.72 --> 1038.839
see it as pretty much a bunch

1035.179 --> 1040.1000000000001
like politically programmed blabbering

1038.839 --> 1043.52
gammas

1040.1 --> 1045.4389999999999
well that's not too far off of what

1043.52 --> 1047.4189999999999
anti-flat earthers do

1045.439 --> 1049.039
they're super gamma they blabber

1047.419 --> 1052.539
constantly

1049.039 --> 1052.539
it's part of their tactical system

1057.919 --> 1063.7990000000002
and yeah are they political well

1060.919 --> 1066.6200000000001
they certainly seem to treat the globe

1063.799 --> 1068.96
like a political issue as in you can't

1066.62 --> 1070.58
surrender no matter what it's more it's

1068.96 --> 1073.4
almost Beyond political more like

1070.58 --> 1075.4399999999998
religious but then again yes kind of CNN

1073.4 --> 1077.0
is kind of doing the same thing as in

1075.44 --> 1080.24
like we

1077.0 --> 1082.66
like you have to believe it that sort of

1080.24 --> 1082.66
attitude

1116.36 --> 1120.9189999999999
levels of global cognitive dissonance

1118.82 --> 1124.039
and I would rather not denial have never

1120.919 --> 1126.14
been higher well

1124.039 --> 1128.66
that is debatable

1126.14 --> 1133.7
I think they've always been this high

1128.66 --> 1136.8200000000002
it's just never been tested before right

1133.7 --> 1139.22
they were always gonna go this far

1136.82 --> 1142.8799999999999
it just never came to it because they

1139.22 --> 1144.559
had some safe ground which now through

1142.88 --> 1146.2990000000002
the Flat Earth developments and

1144.559 --> 1149.6
discoveries

1146.299 --> 1152.299
has been significantly

1149.6 --> 1154.4599999999998
yeah taken

1152.299 --> 1157.039
the ground has been gained it's like

1154.46 --> 1160.16
they lost that maneuvering room and so

1157.039 --> 1164.5
now it is just well what we get to see

1160.16 --> 1164.5
that is what it always was gonna be

1164.78 --> 1170.799
it was always as intense as that it just

1168.62 --> 1173.4799999999998
never really had to come to this before

1170.799 --> 1175.78
and now it does what do you think about

1173.48 --> 1175.78
that

1176.419 --> 1181.76
can't handle the alpha oh yeah I noticed

1179.0 --> 1184.72
this the sound thing again I'll put it

1181.76 --> 1184.72
foreign

1184.92 --> 1188.029
[Music]

1193.9 --> 1198.8600000000001
well the Black Swan

1197.36 --> 1202.6999999999998
yeah

1198.86 --> 1207.1589999999999
the the sun distance reification

1202.7 --> 1207.159
Sextant especially the sexton

1207.98 --> 1212.6
yeah those discoveries the things that

1210.5 --> 1215.659
were always there we are just figuring

1212.6 --> 1217.3999999999999
out how much of an impact they really

1215.659 --> 1220.88
have

1217.4 --> 1222.8600000000001
those Fe discoveries yeah very

1220.88 --> 1225.38
significant ones

1222.86 --> 1228.5
ones that you now spend blabbering

1225.38 --> 1229.8200000000002
endlessly about never confronting and

1228.5 --> 1231.679
that's why you forget that's why you

1229.82 --> 1233.059
have to ask every time like whatever

1231.679 --> 1234.8600000000001
discovered if he didn't make any

1233.059 --> 1238.28
Discovery yeah because the ones we did

1234.86 --> 1241.6399999999999
you immediately forget them immediately

1238.28 --> 1244.22
it's instinct you can't remember them

1241.64 --> 1248.2990000000002
because it breaks everything

1244.22 --> 1250.659
that you're obsessed with that's why you

1248.299 --> 1250.6589999999999
forgot

1251.419 --> 1255.039
see there we go again

1256.28 --> 1262.1789999999999
section is a globe thing yes

1259.52 --> 1262.179
yeah sure it is

1262.28 --> 1267.32
except you need right angles

1264.559 --> 1270.2
as a Baseline

1267.32 --> 1272.6589999999999
flat Lanes all that you know doesn't

1270.2 --> 1275.1200000000001
work on the globe actually at all like

1272.659 --> 1278.0800000000002
not even close I mean you could

1275.12 --> 1278.08
mentally

1278.179 --> 1282.5
back engineer it into a globe what

1281.0 --> 1285.86
you're doing with it

1282.5 --> 1289.28
but the physical practical actions in

1285.86 --> 1292.8799999999999
reality are absolutely in requirement of

1289.28 --> 1296.12
a flat line and straight angle

1292.88 --> 1298.9
on a flat plane

1296.12 --> 1302.4799999999998
and then after that has been done

1298.9 --> 1304.8200000000002
exactly like that then you could back

1302.48 --> 1306.559
engineer it in your mind and bend it

1304.82 --> 1309.32
around that Globe again like you're so

1306.559 --> 1310.58
used to it's your culture yeah bending

1309.32 --> 1313.1
things around the globe that are

1310.58 --> 1315.26
actually flat that's your culture you

1313.1 --> 1317.48
understand that no you don't but it is

1315.26 --> 1319.039
it is your culture it's your habit of

1317.48 --> 1321.159
doing that

1319.039 --> 1322.78
yeah it happens

1321.159 --> 1326.0
afterward

1322.78 --> 1329.48
after it's already been done on a flat

1326.0 --> 1330.679
plane admittedly so I know you can't

1329.48 --> 1332.9
handle it and that's why you forget

1330.679 --> 1335.299
every single time it's brought up every

1332.9 --> 1336.3200000000002
single time you'll just say it's a globe

1335.299 --> 1338.72
thing

1336.32 --> 1341.299
which is obviously even as it is

1338.72 --> 1344.02
presented a very ill thought through

1341.299 --> 1344.02
statement

1351.559 --> 1354.46
ah

1369.98 --> 1378.88
it only works on the glow what globe

1373.58 --> 1378.8799999999999
right let me present my uh Cartoon again

1383.419 --> 1386.98
a little joke where is it

1401.9 --> 1404.679
hmm

1407.6 --> 1413.74
what

1410.299 --> 1413.74
oh for [ __ ] sake

1415.159 --> 1418.1200000000001
uh

1422.72 --> 1429.64
yeah that's better

1426.02 --> 1429.6399999999999
yeah here you go

1436.419 --> 1441.3200000000002
I should make one of these with the

1438.74 --> 1444.02
section too

1441.32 --> 1447.46
now it doesn't work

1444.02 --> 1447.46
not exactly like that

1447.62 --> 1454.3999999999999
I think there's a lot more room to make

1450.62 --> 1458.1999999999998
hilarious cartoons short cartoons based

1454.4 --> 1458.2
on anti-flat earthers and what they do

1483.02 --> 1486.02
laughs

1497.72 --> 1499.9
foreign

1505.1 --> 1510.9189999999999
would it be less disturbing to me if the

1508.64 --> 1512.9
globe reifying anti-fleurthers were

1510.919 --> 1516.0800000000002
indeed algorithm Bots

1512.9 --> 1518.72
no no that would be even more disturbing

1516.08 --> 1523.1589999999999
because that means that algorithm Bots

1518.72 --> 1525.799
have been developed to actually Attain

1523.159 --> 1528.0800000000002
well full-blown human qualities

1525.799 --> 1532.58
because yeah this sort of level of

1528.08 --> 1534.4399999999998
insanity can only be found in humans

1532.58 --> 1536.6589999999999
this is kind of a weird statement isn't

1534.44 --> 1539.3200000000002
it but it's true only humans can be that

1536.659 --> 1539.3200000000002
delusional

1542.659 --> 1548.2990000000002
and yeah whatever they carry in their

1545.48 --> 1551.299
Spirit you know so if that were Bots

1548.299 --> 1553.46
that would be freaky because that means

1551.299 --> 1556.6399999999999
that there's Bots that can literally

1553.46 --> 1558.74
emulate proper human insanity and

1556.64 --> 1563.14
basically make it rub off

1558.74 --> 1563.14
right that's beyond just political

1563.48 --> 1569.299
honey putting or something that's creepy

1566.72 --> 1572.0
so no

1569.299 --> 1573.26
it's just humans and unfortunately a lot

1572.0 --> 1575.0
of humans

1573.26 --> 1576.98
just get caught up in this sort of

1575.0 --> 1580.4
nonsense

1576.98 --> 1582.559
and dedicate their refined skills to

1580.4 --> 1584.179
something that is completely and utterly

1582.559 --> 1586.94
pointless

1584.179 --> 1589.1000000000001
because the self-defeat is all over the

1586.94 --> 1592.3400000000001
place

1589.1 --> 1594.32
right and even as I'm saying this I know

1592.34 --> 1596.8999999999999
that the anti-flat Earth is listening

1594.32 --> 1600.3799999999999
are literally taking my words and saying

1596.9 --> 1603.6200000000001
ha ha ha Arwin is exactly projecting

1600.38 --> 1604.5200000000002
about what the flat earthers are going

1603.62 --> 1606.6789999999999
through

1604.52 --> 1609.2
they are actually the ones point because

1606.679 --> 1610.64
that's what they do now right you have

1609.2 --> 1612.38
to keep in mind every time you're

1610.64 --> 1613.4
dealing with an anti-flatter you're

1612.38 --> 1617.0
dealing

1613.4 --> 1620.0590000000002
with an unwilling to adapt six-year-old

1617.0 --> 1621.2
mindset every single time they can't

1620.059 --> 1624.559
help it

1621.2 --> 1627.8600000000001
they will have a voice inside

1624.559 --> 1630.559
making everything you do turn 180

1627.86 --> 1632.84
degrees right back onto you they're

1630.559 --> 1634.279
obsessed with that some of those some of

1632.84 --> 1636.02
the anti-flat earth is out there

1634.279 --> 1637.34
obsessed

1636.02 --> 1639.62
with

1637.34 --> 1642.399
forming an image in their mind how

1639.62 --> 1645.1399999999999
everything flat earthers do is actually

1642.399 --> 1647.899
what they are doing

1645.14 --> 1652.22
that we are

1647.899 --> 1655.76
the anti-ball earthers right

1652.22 --> 1658.159
and that we are delusional not them even

1655.76 --> 1660.679
though everything that we say is based

1658.159 --> 1662.0
on logically consistent arguments backed

1660.679 --> 1665.1200000000001
by

1662.0 --> 1666.86
like empirical facts and

1665.12 --> 1670.6399999999999
logic

1666.86 --> 1673.2199999999998
and theirs is all based on reverse

1670.64 --> 1675.8600000000001
engineering how you make

1673.22 --> 1678.38
a flat plane into a globe and then

1675.86 --> 1681.6789999999999
overlooking that fact that that is

1678.38 --> 1684.2
actually what they're doing like they on

1681.679 --> 1686.6000000000001
purpose lose the oversight

1684.2 --> 1689.8400000000001
to the order of which they do things

1686.6 --> 1692.899
like the the order of the processes they

1689.84 --> 1695.6589999999999
Overlook that always they

1692.899 --> 1697.8799999999999
they're not supposed to have the

1695.659 --> 1701.0590000000002
oversight over that you see because if

1697.88 --> 1703.88
they would then The Logical pattern

1701.059 --> 1708.22
would sink in and grain them and then

1703.88 --> 1708.22
they couldn't unsee it anymore

1708.38 --> 1711.44
so anti-flatter there's a lot of them

1710.36 --> 1714.4399999999998
are like

1711.44 --> 1714.44
persistently

1718.7 --> 1724.94
going about

1720.62 --> 1727.1589999999999
with it with a persistent ignorance on

1724.94 --> 1730.0
purpose

1727.159 --> 1730.0
they have to

1732.26 --> 1738.679
and you could almost see it as like a

1735.14 --> 1741.0800000000002
kid believing in Santa Claus serious

1738.679 --> 1744.8600000000001
this is not even a joke

1741.08 --> 1746.6589999999999
right you can in a weak moment be made

1744.86 --> 1749.4189999999999
to believe in Santa Claus when I was a

1746.659 --> 1751.1000000000001
really little kid at the moment I really

1749.419 --> 1752.72
believed it was real even though I

1751.1 --> 1754.8799999999999
already got the hints that it kind of

1752.72 --> 1757.64
doesn't make sense I still believed it

1754.88 --> 1759.679
because I wanted it to be real

1757.64 --> 1763.5800000000002
magical thinking that's what that's

1759.679 --> 1766.64
called at least that's what I was told

1763.58 --> 1768.559
and then you systematically like a game

1766.64 --> 1771.0200000000002
in your subconscious because you're not

1768.559 --> 1773.779
conscious of it because you believe it

1771.02 --> 1778.059
you ignore things

1773.779 --> 1781.48
that are contradicting the magical dream

1778.059 --> 1781.48
iconic vision

1782.72 --> 1788.38
and that's what anti-flatter authors do

1785.14 --> 1788.38
exactly that

1794.779 --> 1802.299
the moment

1797.2 --> 1802.299
oh my God that's hilarious

1803.779 --> 1806.679
ah

1819.02 --> 1824.96
Santa always wrote just like my mom it

1822.02 --> 1827.5
was suspicious and cause trust issues

1824.96 --> 1827.5
hmm

1828.74 --> 1835.039
well my mom had a very

1831.62 --> 1838.4599999999998
careful handwriting

1835.039 --> 1841.039
like much better than my dad's and

1838.46 --> 1843.279
so it was always a pleasure to even read

1841.039 --> 1843.279
it

1843.86 --> 1846.82
like I didn't

1847.46 --> 1852.559
I didn't even think like Santa has to

1850.34 --> 1854.24
have her handwriting I never that

1852.559 --> 1857.4189999999999
literally

1854.24 --> 1861.08
wow yeah I've literally before this

1857.419 --> 1862.94
moment never even considered that

1861.08 --> 1865.519
like I just never thought about it like

1862.94 --> 1867.159
oh yeah Santa is a person well they're

1865.519 --> 1870.38
gonna have a handwriting

1867.159 --> 1871.3990000000001
uh never thought of that before ever

1870.38 --> 1873.74
since

1871.399 --> 1875.9799999999998
and I'm almost 42 and that's pretty

1873.74 --> 1875.98
weird

1881.779 --> 1887.539
yeah and in my case I'm basically

1884.72 --> 1891.14
referring to Saint Nicholas which we

1887.539 --> 1892.46
celebrate on the fifth

1891.14 --> 1894.919
it's not

1892.46 --> 1898.519
it's not Christmas

1894.919 --> 1901.8200000000002
but it's very similar

1898.519 --> 1903.2
to the Christmas tradition with presents

1901.82 --> 1905.059
and everything and

1903.2 --> 1909.14
and we don't have somebody that go

1905.059 --> 1912.2
through the chimneys or there's like

1909.14 --> 1915.5
the main difference is

1912.2 --> 1917.96
like our Santa Claus is actually a saint

1915.5 --> 1920.72
who lives in Spain

1917.96 --> 1923.0
as a really big boat

1920.72 --> 1927.26
a steamboat

1923.0 --> 1932.12
and he has workers that are

1927.26 --> 1934.22
oh black Pete's back face oh yeah I love

1932.12 --> 1936.4399999999998
it freaking love it you ain't gonna take

1934.22 --> 1938.6000000000001
our black face away it's our Christmas

1936.44 --> 1940.3990000000001
tradition you hear me

1938.6 --> 1943.399
you can't take away

1940.399 --> 1946.1
it I don't care how supposedly insulted

1943.399 --> 1948.7399999999998
you are whatever blah blah blah

1946.1 --> 1951.3799999999999
it's the tradition right so we don't

1948.74 --> 1952.82
have elves we have black Pete's and

1951.38 --> 1955.159
they're the ones that are supposedly

1952.82 --> 1957.6789999999999
going through the chimneys that's also

1955.159 --> 1960.2600000000002
why they get all black

1957.679 --> 1963.44
Santa Claus just rides around on his

1960.26 --> 1967.1
horse over the rooftops everywhere yeah

1963.44 --> 1969.74
I know that makes a lot more sense right

1967.1 --> 1974.0
I mean he doesn't have a

1969.74 --> 1977.36
flying sled or anything but yeah he just

1974.0 --> 1980.86
walks over the rooftops with a horse

1977.36 --> 1980.86
right makes perfect sense

1993.2 --> 1999.74
and at least he just lives in a normal

1995.12 --> 2001.9799999999998
country not somewhere in a giant ice cap

1999.74 --> 2001.98
foreign

2003.159 --> 2007.779
and he only has to provide for the

2005.74 --> 2011.2
Netherlands which makes it more doable

2007.779 --> 2013.779
even in the mind of a kid

2011.2 --> 2017.38
because it's not said like no this is

2013.779 --> 2019.6
Santa Claus goes to everybody uh no he

2017.38 --> 2020.7990000000002
only goes to the places where it's

2019.6 --> 2023.559
celebrated

2020.799 --> 2026.74
which is the Netherlands and I think

2023.559 --> 2029.44
maybe like Germany

2026.74 --> 2031.539
too perhaps I don't know but mostly it's

2029.44 --> 2033.96
just focus or not it's just here in the

2031.539 --> 2033.96
Netherlands

2035.58 --> 2040.799
anyway just thought it was funny to

2038.32 --> 2040.799
bring that up

2056.619 --> 2060.7200000000003
oh Jesus seeking star water

2064.599 --> 2067.44
an eight-year-old

2068.859 --> 2071.8199999999997
roof

2073.04 --> 2076.239
[Music]

2077.56 --> 2082.679
oh oh that's terrible Wesley sure

2083.679 --> 2089.8
yeah well thank God in my family

2086.159 --> 2093.2200000000003
nobody's getting waxed or at least not

2089.8 --> 2096.04
my stepmom and my dad but my stepmom was

2093.22 --> 2098.5
kind of like and I'm a bit worried a

2096.04 --> 2100.599
little bit but she's

2098.5 --> 2103.02
she has to make her own decision but she

2100.599 --> 2105.099
said like yeah I'm gonna take the tests

2103.02 --> 2107.68
once a year

2105.099 --> 2110.619
for the QR code because that apparently

2107.68 --> 2113.2799999999997
like makes a whole lot of difference for

2110.619 --> 2116.26
her profession

2113.28 --> 2119.38
yeah otherwise it would be literally

2116.26 --> 2121.96
just building down and then losing it

2119.38 --> 2125.1400000000003
but still I kind of had to warn her like

2121.96 --> 2129.099
uh okay that seems reasonable it's

2125.14 --> 2131.4
better than a jab but ugh

2129.099 --> 2135.28
I mean

2131.4 --> 2137.02
there may potentially be very dangerous

2135.28 --> 2141.099
stuff

2137.02 --> 2143.5
in in the tests that get absorbed by you

2141.099 --> 2145.42
especially if you do it in your nose

2143.5 --> 2147.64
and yeah you might yeah they might

2145.42 --> 2151.42
contain all kinds of things

2147.64 --> 2153.5789999999997
not 100 sure yet it might be selective

2151.42 --> 2156.16
it might be already Universal without

2153.579 --> 2159.4
having even told anybody

2156.16 --> 2161.74
but basically potential nanowire

2159.4 --> 2165.82
invasive technology

2161.74 --> 2168.7599999999998
that's also part partly in

2165.82 --> 2170.8590000000004
the Jabs apparently

2168.76 --> 2173.7400000000002
dude I told you there was so much [ __ ]

2170.859 --> 2176.0789999999997
in there you this is Gonna Take Years

2173.74 --> 2178.8999999999996
to even lay it all out what the hell's

2176.079 --> 2181.9
all in that [ __ ] right

2178.9 --> 2184.96
but yeah just going about with tests can

2181.9 --> 2187.599
also be a compounding danger especially

2184.96 --> 2190.3
if you do it frequently

2187.599 --> 2194.6400000000003
right so that's about it

2190.3 --> 2194.6400000000003
nobody's getting the jab ever

2196.24 --> 2199.4399999999996
hey LSG

2202.66 --> 2206.98
all right

2204.339 --> 2209.38
I I hope she figures it out I mean she's

2206.98 --> 2212.38
a really awesome lady

2209.38 --> 2215.079
and people have actually respect for and

2212.38 --> 2217.06
she deserves it because she's she's

2215.079 --> 2219.6400000000003
serious

2217.06 --> 2220.72
right in a way she's cut yeah sounds a

2219.64 --> 2221.98
bit weird

2220.72 --> 2225.5789999999997
she's

2221.98 --> 2227.68
kind of like a priest in a way but in

2225.579 --> 2230.8590000000004
her own way Maggie kind of a pagan

2227.68 --> 2232.66
priest but not dude everything is about

2230.859 --> 2236.94
calm and

2232.66 --> 2236.94
Clarity and just natural

2237.579 --> 2244.42
and good good and clear and natural so I

2241.839 --> 2246.94
yeah very pleasant especially during

2244.42 --> 2250.48
Christmas because that that's also how

2246.94 --> 2253.18
she decorates everything and

2250.48 --> 2256.359
for her like it all

2253.18 --> 2258.46
she makes the display for people to

2256.359 --> 2261.7
rejoice

2258.46 --> 2264.359
like she tells us

2261.7 --> 2267.52
so she like has this Christmas tree

2264.359 --> 2269.2
amazing really big one too it's a pretty

2267.52 --> 2271.78
big building

2269.2 --> 2274.48
pretty big room amazing tree and she

2271.78 --> 2277.48
just keeps the window open day and night

2274.48 --> 2279.7
so that anybody that goes by because

2277.48 --> 2282.7
there's like a road there and a walking

2279.7 --> 2286.4199999999996
path anybody can just look at it she

2282.7 --> 2288.2799999999997
like even went out there to test it

2286.42 --> 2290.44
what would it look like from the outside

2288.28 --> 2292.96
like that's how much she cares about

2290.44 --> 2296.339
other people okay

2292.96 --> 2296.339
in those types of things

2297.4 --> 2302.44
it's just great

2299.32 --> 2304.6600000000003
I really love my stepmom

2302.44 --> 2306.16
and of course my dad really happy for

2304.66 --> 2309.7799999999997
him

2306.16 --> 2309.7799999999997
and he was doing really good

2312.04 --> 2315.04
still

2313.359 --> 2317.92
yeah

2315.04 --> 2320.579
still doing great

2317.92 --> 2320.579
huh

2320.859 --> 2324.7799999999997
what are you talking about

2329.92 --> 2334.96
oh the graphene

2331.78 --> 2337.0600000000004
yes well the graphene

2334.96 --> 2339.15
reminds a whole lot of people including

2337.06 --> 2342.2599999999998
myself of

2339.15 --> 2342.26
[Music]

2344.74 --> 2347.74
nanotech

2349.3 --> 2352.26
yeah creepy

2358.3 --> 2361.44
from the death guard

2363.16 --> 2369.22
right yeah we did Lay cards too that's

2366.22 --> 2371.14
it's tradition it's her tradition she's

2369.22 --> 2373.5989999999997
really about card reading and all that

2371.14 --> 2376.839
she has amazing card decks

2373.599 --> 2381.0
and of course drawing just

2376.839 --> 2381.0
pretty heavy cards as usual

2384.82 --> 2388.0
like

2385.9 --> 2391.42
yeah I could just say it it wasn't an

2388.0 --> 2394.18
animal based deck so my dad got an owl

2391.42 --> 2399.06
I got a ladybird

2394.18 --> 2399.06
and my stepmom had a Raging Bull

2402.16 --> 2408.0989999999997
and yeah apparently there were some

2404.68 --> 2410.2
Spirits involved too which happens over

2408.099 --> 2413.6400000000003
there

2410.2 --> 2413.64
got a visit from my grandma

2417.76 --> 2423.099
yeah

2420.06 --> 2424.96
didn't see any Apparition but I

2423.099 --> 2428.1400000000003
definitely felt it oh I did see actually

2424.96 --> 2432.099
an apparition of one of the dogs

2428.14 --> 2436.7799999999997
that had like died two years ago

2432.099 --> 2439.599
who I've really bonded with and I like

2436.78 --> 2442.2400000000002
Step Brothers says like oh look it's

2439.599 --> 2445.02
named the dog like pharah like oh it's

2442.24 --> 2448.1189999999997
this is there and I'm like what what

2445.02 --> 2450.4
I saw something

2448.119 --> 2452.26
in the corner of my eye like the colors

2450.4 --> 2455.1600000000003
of that dog

2452.26 --> 2455.1600000000003
that was weird

2456.94 --> 2464.2200000000003
it's always a magical time

2460.18 --> 2464.22
Christmas at my stepmoms

2469.54 --> 2476.7
yeah what Wesley sure

2472.42 --> 2476.7000000000003
Starbucks uses graphene

2476.98 --> 2480.28
a

2478.18 --> 2483.0989999999997
is that even legal

2480.28 --> 2485.38
I don't think that's just legal

2483.099 --> 2488.52
wisely sure are you sure about that that

2485.38 --> 2488.52
is not just a rumor

2492.22 --> 2498.839
I said you're at it good for Emily visit

2494.619 --> 2498.839
yeah yeah no I'm very happy about it

2499.0 --> 2507.579
I'm also happy that I didn't like

2504.28 --> 2509.8
let the tension build up and get to me

2507.579 --> 2512.079
like kind of happened last year a bit

2509.8 --> 2514.7200000000003
not that I get in a real fight but I

2512.079 --> 2517.3590000000004
would just be like oh this and that just

2514.72 --> 2519.339
you know too much energy and that's like

2517.359 --> 2523.06
to them it's like

2519.339 --> 2526.2999999999997
no no real anger no personal attacks

2523.06 --> 2528.5789999999997
never we don't do that I don't do that

2526.3 --> 2532.119
and they don't either

2528.579 --> 2534.7000000000003
right we're way above that sounds a bit

2532.119 --> 2539.619
yeah but it that's what it is

2534.7 --> 2542.98
but I didn't like get like too energetic

2539.619 --> 2545.38
just had a really nice calm

2542.98 --> 2548.319
carefully thought out

2545.38 --> 2550.3
didn't drink anything

2548.319 --> 2553.2
didn't smoke anything and they didn't

2550.3 --> 2553.2000000000003
really need to

2554.92 --> 2561.099
just enjoying talking nibbling on great

2559.0 --> 2564.339
things apparently my dad makes cookies

2561.099 --> 2568.06
now like cookies

2564.339 --> 2569.14
with like that uh doughless cookies

2568.06 --> 2571.7799999999997
weird

2569.14 --> 2573.42
based on like nuts and all kinds of but

2571.78 --> 2576.94
it was delicious

2573.42 --> 2580.0
so it's all kinds of nibbly things and

2576.94 --> 2582.2200000000003
then eventually dinner it's just great I

2580.0 --> 2584.319
had a really good time it was really

2582.22 --> 2587.16
like

2584.319 --> 2587.16
a relief

2618.52 --> 2624.52
but yeah that graphene story Wesley

2622.06 --> 2627.22
shirt that's kind of messed up

2624.52 --> 2629.2599999999998
like I don't know if that's real though

2627.22 --> 2631.839
because I don't think it's legal to just

2629.26 --> 2634.7200000000003
put that in food

2631.839 --> 2637.48
I mean like tracking through packaging

2634.72 --> 2639.7599999999998
and all that is one thing right but in

2637.48 --> 2642.22
the actual food

2639.76 --> 2645.1600000000003
I don't know how that works in the US

2642.22 --> 2647.8799999999997
but I don't think that's legal in Europe

2645.16 --> 2647.8799999999997
at all

2649.96 --> 2653.819
at least I hope not God

2662.8 --> 2667.42
I swear they wanted to open their

2664.9 --> 2669.76
locations weird

2667.42 --> 2673.079
strange Wesley sure

2669.76 --> 2673.079
it's a really odd story

2687.119 --> 2692.1400000000003
Monsanto but yeah but that's that's

2689.56 --> 2695.619
different

2692.14 --> 2698.46
that's different seeking like Monsanto

2695.619 --> 2702.839
like they couldn't just

2698.46 --> 2702.839
secretly poison [ __ ] right

2702.94 --> 2707.619
I mean the worst that could happen is

2705.04 --> 2709.9
some food producer would use GMO and

2707.619 --> 2712.079
then not say it but they even would have

2709.9 --> 2712.079
to

2713.02 --> 2716.98
right so it's more like an evil in plain

2715.06 --> 2721.119
sight that's not the same as just

2716.98 --> 2724.56
secretly putting nanotech in drinks

2721.119 --> 2724.56
that's a whole other level

2739.72 --> 2745.24
no Wesley sure that's not true

2742.18 --> 2748.06
no entire league judicial system is not

2745.24 --> 2750.52
based in frauds it's a system it's

2748.06 --> 2753.4
persistent

2750.52 --> 2758.04
and it's not just constructed by evil

2753.4 --> 2758.04
people right you gotta realize that

2758.68 --> 2765.46
this yeah like a lot of this legal stuff

2763.119 --> 2768.1600000000003
the basis

2765.46 --> 2770.26
the foundations are created by very

2768.16 --> 2772.5989999999997
smart people

2770.26 --> 2775.48
there's a lot of passion

2772.599 --> 2777.7000000000003
and wisdom in the past when not

2775.48 --> 2781.48
everybody was completely [ __ ] yet

2777.7 --> 2784.5
right like I mean modern some Modern

2781.48 --> 2786.819
judges may be getting all loopy and

2784.5 --> 2788.98
delusional through political correctness

2786.819 --> 2790.06
indoctrination or whatever that kind of

2788.98 --> 2793.9
[ __ ]

2790.06 --> 2796.2999999999997
but the the books everything that's been

2793.9 --> 2801.04
building for hundreds of years

2796.3 --> 2802.8390000000004
that's actually made by very wise people

2801.04 --> 2805.9
that was their life

2802.839 --> 2809.0789999999997
was the dedication to get it right

2805.9 --> 2812.28
so don't say it it's all [ __ ] all

2809.079 --> 2812.28
legal is [ __ ] no it's not

2814.06 --> 2819.4
but yeah you gotta have it it really

2816.7 --> 2822.16
only works when you have like people in

2819.4 --> 2823.9
the justice system that are good and

2822.16 --> 2825.7
that are wise

2823.9 --> 2829.119
and I want to do the right thing and

2825.7 --> 2831.72
that they're not politically dissuaded

2829.119 --> 2831.7200000000003
from it

2832.06 --> 2835.2
and that matters everything

2835.54 --> 2842.88
because yeah a judicial system in a time

2839.5 --> 2845.559
can be corrupted by the judges whatever

2842.88 --> 2846.6400000000003
ignoring terrible things just ignoring

2845.559 --> 2848.44
it

2846.64 --> 2851.0789999999997
yeah and then everything goes to [ __ ]

2848.44 --> 2853.44
it's not because the judicial system no

2851.079 --> 2856.7200000000003
that's because of those freaking people

2853.44 --> 2858.339
that are corrupting and not tackling the

2856.72 --> 2861.16
issue at hand

2858.339 --> 2864.42
see it's not the system it's the person

2861.16 --> 2864.42
that's how it works

2865.599 --> 2871.839
Justice can only be dispensed if the

2869.44 --> 2873.2200000000003
person acting

2871.839 --> 2877.54
at it

2873.22 --> 2880.54
isn't uncorrupted that's the difference

2877.54 --> 2880.54
now

2893.44 --> 2898.18
this is ridiculous so what are you going

2895.9 --> 2900.2200000000003
to replace it with Wesley sure you're

2898.18 --> 2902.14
just gonna go Barbarian on everybody's

2900.22 --> 2903.64
ass

2902.14 --> 2907.14
like

2903.64 --> 2907.14
what the [ __ ] is the point

2908.02 --> 2913.18
you're just squirting you just say no no

2910.54 --> 2916.18
more law no more law you're so corrupted

2913.18 --> 2919.54
no you're being a [ __ ]

2916.18 --> 2923.6189999999997
why did you listen to what I said

2919.54 --> 2926.68
it's the individuals the system itself

2923.619 --> 2928.3
is not bad

2926.68 --> 2930.819
yeah common law

2928.3 --> 2934.6800000000003
yeah you can use that that's also part

2930.819 --> 2934.68
of it don't you get it

2948.099 --> 2955.9
look into my being naive excuse me are

2952.119 --> 2958.1800000000003
you giving me lip bro bro

2955.9 --> 2961.44
this is not a place to go squirting like

2958.18 --> 2961.44
that you get me

2962.14 --> 2965.339
I know what I'm talking about

2973.599 --> 2979.319
that's right ask and receive you get it

2976.72 --> 2979.319
hold on

2999.22 --> 3002.18
foreign

3029.46 --> 3034.619
you can't use that I don't know where

3031.92 --> 3036.839
here is according to you and I don't

3034.619 --> 3039.38
know like what kind of system you're

3036.839 --> 3039.38
dealing with

3041.4 --> 3047.2200000000003
but yeah maritime law doesn't supposed

3044.52 --> 3049.44
to apply to the land

3047.22 --> 3053.22
it doesn't

3049.44 --> 3056.46
probably lead like look people in the

3053.22 --> 3059.0989999999997
justice system can use it for bad you

3056.46 --> 3060.9
understand they can it's the individuals

3059.099 --> 3065.2200000000003
doesn't make the systematic makes the

3060.9 --> 3068.819
individual but bad right the system is

3065.22 --> 3071.16
a set of carefully refined tools that

3068.819 --> 3072.119
you have to use in a certain way to get

3071.16 --> 3074.7
it right

3072.119 --> 3077.04
and can be abused by individuals

3074.7 --> 3079.2599999999998
corruption that's what it's called

3077.04 --> 3081.72
now if there's some reason somewhere

3079.26 --> 3085.1400000000003
when they're applying direct maritime

3081.72 --> 3088.2799999999997
law they're not supposed to do that

3085.14 --> 3088.2799999999997
that's corruption

3091.38 --> 3096.059
it's not the system they're not supposed

3093.54 --> 3098.22
to like you can't complain

3096.059 --> 3100.98
about the law

3098.22 --> 3104.0989999999997
or the law it's all [ __ ] it's all

3100.98 --> 3106.68
bullsh well yeah it would be [ __ ] if

3104.099 --> 3108.6600000000003
it's not applied if they don't actually

3106.68 --> 3110.4199999999996
keep to it they don't stick to it they

3108.66 --> 3113.3999999999996
just

3110.42 --> 3115.319
maneuver whatever they want politically

3113.4 --> 3117.359
to get whatever they want as quickly as

3115.319 --> 3120.0589999999997
possible Right

3117.359 --> 3124.64
that's corruption that's not the law

3120.059 --> 3124.6400000000003
system that's the people abusing it

3131.22 --> 3133.8799999999997
uh

3135.42 --> 3141.059
yes yes that's right so you can start

3137.76 --> 3145.26
yeah but yeah that that's right

3141.059 --> 3147.5400000000004
Court language is different it's not our

3145.26 --> 3151.3190000000004
regular language there's a lot of coding

3147.54 --> 3153.54
in there you have to get it you have to

3151.319 --> 3155.16
get it if you go in there otherwise

3153.54 --> 3156.96
you're going to do things that you don't

3155.16 --> 3158.5789999999997
understand

3156.96 --> 3160.44
you're not gonna have the oversight

3158.579 --> 3163.7400000000002
that's kind of why you need a lawyer

3160.44 --> 3165.96
because they are supposed supposed to

3163.74 --> 3167.22
understand that and then they can tell

3165.96 --> 3169.5
you like no

3167.22 --> 3173.2799999999997
don't answer there

3169.5 --> 3174.9
yes answer this right because they have

3173.28 --> 3178.88
the oversight over how that works

3174.9 --> 3178.88
they're supposed to that's their job

3212.88 --> 3217.619
okay Wesley sure sure

3215.76 --> 3219.3590000000004
look

3217.619 --> 3221.7000000000003
again

3219.359 --> 3224.5789999999997
seems like a corruption situation

3221.7 --> 3226.74
probably one that's been put into place

3224.579 --> 3230.3
a long time ago so long that people

3226.74 --> 3230.2999999999997
don't even remember that happen

3239.339 --> 3244.68
right but as far as I know that doesn't

3242.46 --> 3245.94
apply here in Europe

3244.68 --> 3249.44
hope

3245.94 --> 3249.44
don't have full oversight

3287.4 --> 3292.04
iron what never heard of that

3299.819 --> 3302.599
foreign

3306.42 --> 3311.66
yeah that's what it reminds me about too

3308.579 --> 3311.6600000000003
Freeman that's right

3318.54 --> 3325.819
wow that really really sucks look if

3322.5 --> 3325.819
it's that bad yeah

3326.099 --> 3330.54
I'd say

3327.9 --> 3333.2400000000002
have a freaking Revolution and wipe it

3330.54 --> 3335.16
all off the entire [ __ ] thing then if

3333.24 --> 3337.14
it's that corrupted that fundamentally

3335.16 --> 3340.339
corrupted where everybody in the justice

3337.14 --> 3342.72
system is all part of the fundamental

3340.339 --> 3345.359
egregious corruption

3342.72 --> 3349.0789999999997
that completely rearranges just how law

3345.359 --> 3350.52
works yeah they should probably all just

3349.079 --> 3353.819
be

3350.52 --> 3355.14
put on a fire and lit lit up yeah I

3353.819 --> 3357.839
agree

3355.14 --> 3361.16
good luck with that

3357.839 --> 3361.16
I'm not gonna do that

3361.5 --> 3367.5
I mean if something like that was going

3364.02 --> 3369.72
on here I might consider it

3367.5 --> 3372.599
it's going to be your problem though

3369.72 --> 3375.66
your problem as an American as you were

3372.599 --> 3377.52
born an American into that slavery into

3375.66 --> 3381.2599999999998
that corruption and you're gonna have to

3377.52 --> 3381.2599999999998
fix it because nobody else will

3387.54 --> 3392.04
yeah and make sure not to burn down any

3390.24 --> 3395.359
ancient buildings while you're at it

3392.04 --> 3395.359
just go for the people

3395.4 --> 3401.339
don't get all [ __ ]

3398.88 --> 3403.7400000000002
and burn everything down because the

3401.339 --> 3406.38
symbols that we associate yeah that's

3403.74 --> 3408.0589999999997
because they want that right that's what

3406.38 --> 3411.0
corruption does take something beautiful

3408.059 --> 3412.3190000000004
rub it in your face in association with

3411.0 --> 3415.619
the darkness

3412.319 --> 3418.68
and then that beauty becomes corrupted

3415.619 --> 3421.92
to you in your psyche and then you might

3418.68 --> 3424.819
be seduced in the end to burn that

3421.92 --> 3427.14
instead of

3424.819 --> 3431.099
dislodging it

3427.14 --> 3434.16
saying no we will not let your Decades

3431.099 --> 3435.96
of indoctrination corrupt this innocent

3434.16 --> 3438.7799999999997
thing

3435.96 --> 3440.339
that you have associated with you by

3438.78 --> 3443.52
your own actions

3440.339 --> 3446.52
and not by the thing

3443.52 --> 3448.5
it is ancient right that's

3446.52 --> 3450.359
what I'm talking about just go for the

3448.5 --> 3452.52
people don't

3450.359 --> 3455.2799999999997
don't start building burnings

3452.52 --> 3460.4
burning buildings that's ridiculous

3455.28 --> 3460.4
right so yeah go ahead dude

3460.559 --> 3470.2400000000002
start the revolt go ahead good luck

3465.599 --> 3470.2400000000002
I mean you got guns and [ __ ]

3470.46 --> 3476.52
right I I bet they have absolutely no

3474.299 --> 3479.579
plan to respond to such an action

3476.52 --> 3482.339
whatsoever it's not gonna work in their

3479.579 --> 3486.2400000000002
favor if you do this right

3482.339 --> 3489.0589999999997
I'm sure you had this well planned out

3486.24 --> 3490.859
very carefully over decades in

3489.059 --> 3493.079
conjunction with other people that are

3490.859 --> 3495.0589999999997
just as sharp-minded as to figure out

3493.079 --> 3496.319
how to resolve this

3495.059 --> 3498.96
right

3496.319 --> 3502.52
it's already underway oh

3498.96 --> 3502.52
are you a q follower

3508.41 --> 3511.489
[Music]

3515.46 --> 3519.32
[Music]

3538.76 --> 3543.8390000000004
pro-american government because I think

3540.96 --> 3546.059
that American government is actually a

3543.839 --> 3548.94
pretty decent system

3546.059 --> 3552.0
in its roots it's just

3548.94 --> 3554.4
there's this giant infection sitting on

3552.0 --> 3555.54
it called Satan

3554.4 --> 3560.819
yeah

3555.54 --> 3562.44
like really really satanic people that

3560.819 --> 3564.0
are sitting there

3562.44 --> 3566.2200000000003
festering

3564.0 --> 3568.319
making it terrible it's not the system

3566.22 --> 3570.7799999999997
it's the people

3568.319 --> 3573.599
it's the freaking people that do that

3570.78 --> 3577.099
that have allowed that to persist and

3573.599 --> 3577.099
that even make it worse

3600.78 --> 3606.7400000000002
okay Wesley shares sure okay it sounds

3604.2 --> 3606.74
interesting

3610.14 --> 3618.0589999999997
I mean if it's if it's real

3614.52 --> 3620.579
then we'll find out right there might be

3618.059 --> 3623.28
yeah if you say there might be a

3620.579 --> 3627.5
revolution in the court systems in the

3623.28 --> 3627.5
U.S that would be interesting

3629.64 --> 3635.64
now of course that could absolutely like

3632.7 --> 3639.1189999999997
it always does in every moment of an

3635.64 --> 3641.5789999999997
actual Revolution lead to a complete

3639.119 --> 3644.7000000000003
slap around making everything a hundred

3641.579 --> 3647.1600000000003
times worse it could also happen

3644.7 --> 3649.859
gotta realize that because that's

3647.16 --> 3652.02
exactly what they want these satanists

3649.859 --> 3654.0
now are designing things to agitate

3652.02 --> 3656.04
everybody to enforce them to make a move

3654.0 --> 3658.98
so they can make the counter move that

3656.04 --> 3660.66
they've planned for for decades on every

3658.98 --> 3663.599
single system

3660.66 --> 3665.0989999999997
that's what they always do

3663.599 --> 3667.2000000000003
so every time

3665.099 --> 3670.5
you start a revolution to Route them

3667.2 --> 3673.7599999999998
they're gonna give you a war like a

3670.5 --> 3673.76
really serious War

3673.98 --> 3677.88
on levels you don't even understand

3675.96 --> 3681.559
exist yet

3677.88 --> 3681.559
that's what they always do

3689.28 --> 3696.1800000000003
because that's what satanists do

3693.359 --> 3698.88
they're unbelievably tenacious and

3696.18 --> 3701.22
that's why it's pretty much worth every

3698.88 --> 3705.42
conceivable sacrifice

3701.22 --> 3707.04
to literally route them out roots and

3705.42 --> 3709.6800000000003
all forever

3707.04 --> 3711.839
without a second thought as to what is

3709.68 --> 3714.8999999999996
being sacrificed in the process it's

3711.839 --> 3718.859
really worth it because they will make

3714.9 --> 3723.7200000000003
everything an absolute nightmare beyond

3718.859 --> 3726.5989999999997
your comprehension if you don't do that

3723.72 --> 3728.8799999999997
if you think you can get a fair fight

3726.599 --> 3731.6400000000003
out of it you can't they will make

3728.88 --> 3734.28
everything a giant nightmare that's why

3731.64 --> 3739.3799999999997
you have to move Swift and without Mercy

3734.28 --> 3741.8390000000004
Swift and without Mercy Swift very Swift

3739.38 --> 3744.359
very very Swift and without Mercy

3741.839 --> 3746.16
without hesitation absolutely without

3744.359 --> 3747.24
hesitation

3746.16 --> 3750.18
because

3747.24 --> 3752.9399999999996
otherwise it's just going to be a hell

3750.18 --> 3755.8999999999996
much worse than it was before

3752.94 --> 3755.9
it's the only way

3757.44 --> 3759.68
foreign

3770.7 --> 3775.22
no you don't know what you're talking

3772.14 --> 3775.22
about Lucifer

3775.319 --> 3779.819
and they don't take the Jabs and

3777.059 --> 3782.7000000000003
boosters they don't some do

3779.819 --> 3786.72
the ones that matter don't yeah they

3782.7 --> 3789.299
make their players their faces their

3786.72 --> 3791.7
puppet on a stick that goes in front of

3789.299 --> 3794.28
the cameras and supposed to represent

3791.7 --> 3796.4399999999996
yeah they make those take them and make

3794.28 --> 3799.38
them suffer in front of the camera yeah

3796.44 --> 3801.359
the ones that actually matter don't do

3799.38 --> 3804.539
that

3801.359 --> 3807.0589999999997
they don't do that ever they know what

3804.539 --> 3810.78
they're doing they don't sacrifice

3807.059 --> 3813.98
themselves to Satan you see they only do

3810.78 --> 3813.98
that with others

3822.539 --> 3827.5200000000004
yeah the puppets on a stick

3825.18 --> 3830.5789999999997
that you get to see in the news and TV

3827.52 --> 3834.0
and everything they they're not the

3830.579 --> 3836.6400000000003
rulers they're puppets on a stick they

3834.0 --> 3839.339
get to suffer

3836.64 --> 3841.92
in plain sight right the more in plain

3839.339 --> 3844.68
sight the better they want the suffering

3841.92 --> 3848.539
to rub off you see they're not gonna do

3844.68 --> 3848.5389999999998
it the people that don't get on camera

3848.579 --> 3854.1600000000003
that are actually staring the plan

3850.799 --> 3857.52
managing it the dark [ __ ] they don't do

3854.16 --> 3859.3799999999997
it they're not freaking insane well not

3857.52 --> 3863.0
like that

3859.38 --> 3863.0
they're not self-destructive

3864.44 --> 3869.579
like that not in the direct they're not

3866.88 --> 3872.339
like trying to find a way out to haste

3869.579 --> 3874.2000000000003
in the end they don't do that no they'll

3872.339 --> 3876.74
haste in the end for everybody else not

3874.2 --> 3876.74
themselves

3876.78 --> 3883.52
right and by doing that they literally

3880.039 --> 3883.5200000000004
end their spirit

3885.96 --> 3891.14
that like they they have no soul because

3888.24 --> 3894.18
of that it's machine-like efficiency

3891.14 --> 3896.8799999999997
they don't fall for their own traps to

3894.18 --> 3899.2799999999997
believe that is [ __ ]

3896.88 --> 3902.6400000000003
right and the puppets on the stick you

3899.28 --> 3906.3590000000004
get to see in media are not them they're

3902.64 --> 3908.64
the straw man you get it

3906.359 --> 3910.38
they're all Straw Men

3908.64 --> 3912.839
if you get to see him on the news

3910.38 --> 3915.78
they're a straw man

3912.839 --> 3917.94
they're not the ones in control

3915.78 --> 3921.3190000000004
they never are they're the straw man

3917.94 --> 3921.319
they're the puppets on the stick

3931.799 --> 3938.18
yeah that's absolute [ __ ] [ __ ]

3935.46 --> 3938.18
no

3939.559 --> 3946.44
[ __ ] they're actors

3943.02 --> 3949.5
the only group Soul complex they have is

3946.44 --> 3953.4
through their act that they're acting

3949.5 --> 3956.88
and they believe in their act

3953.4 --> 3959.64
they're not in control

3956.88 --> 3962.6400000000003
they're not in control

3959.64 --> 3967.02
and Lucifer you think

3962.64 --> 3971.1189999999997
through them is not in control either

3967.02 --> 3971.119
it's just Minds

3972.119 --> 3980.2400000000002
they're Lucifer if at best is trying to

3975.66 --> 3980.24
control people's minds is separate

3980.579 --> 3985.44
they're not actually in control they're

3983.039 --> 3988.8590000000004
just kind of like being left to control

3985.44 --> 3990.9
people's minds or attempt that somehow

3988.859 --> 3993.24
whatever it takes

3990.9 --> 3997.2200000000003
they're not actually in control of the

3993.24 --> 3997.22
system they're puppets on a stick

3997.44 --> 4004.039
they're there to Mesmerize you to stare

4000.799 --> 4007.339
you to convince you to distract you

4004.039 --> 4010.4
to take the blame to be the lightning

4007.339 --> 4012.5789999999997
rod when things go sour that's what they

4010.4 --> 4012.579
are

4013.16 --> 4019.18
that's why they go on camera that's why

4015.92 --> 4019.1800000000003
they're the puppets on a stick

4021.52 --> 4029.44
you have absolutely no evidence of that

4024.44 --> 4029.44
notion whatsoever a hive-minded [ __ ]

4033.079 --> 4039.02
people can be naturally hive-minded

4035.859 --> 4041.839
naturally good I've minded

4039.02 --> 4045.2599999999998
the mind is simply very flexible it's

4041.839 --> 4047.5389999999998
not something special they do

4045.26 --> 4050.98
they just applied on a different

4047.539 --> 4050.98
frequency path

4055.039 --> 4061.7000000000003
the only hive

4057.38 --> 4064.1600000000003
that they share is the political

4061.7 --> 4067.64
Legacy they are trying to program

4064.16 --> 4069.6189999999997
everyone with and they will step

4067.64 --> 4072.2599999999998
finish each other other sentences

4069.619 --> 4074.539
everything because that's what they do

4072.26 --> 4077.0
that's not a hive mind that's called a

4074.539 --> 4079.46
political program that everybody's

4077.0 --> 4081.88
adapting to the the puppets on the stick

4079.46 --> 4081.88
that is

4082.88 --> 4088.839
it's cool I used to be naive too I think

4085.039 --> 4088.8390000000004
you're still naive and I think that's

4089.059 --> 4093.8590000000004
kind of soliciting to get banned if

4091.64 --> 4097.159
you're gonna talk to me like that

4093.859 --> 4098.719
I'm taking you very serious

4097.159 --> 4101.12
yeah

4098.719 --> 4104.12
I know about these things I know about

4101.12 --> 4107.239
Spirit mechanics I know about what

4104.12 --> 4109.94
people think is collectivism I know all

4107.239 --> 4114.62
that I know how it works

4109.94 --> 4116.0599999999995
I can like build that if I needed to

4114.62 --> 4119.54
narratives

4116.06 --> 4121.719
mind control ideas seductions all these

4119.54 --> 4121.719
things

4122.06 --> 4126.5
I do know what I'm talking about I am

4124.04 --> 4131.0
not freaking naive about this you're

4126.5 --> 4131.0
overblowing it you're squirting

4131.719 --> 4138.5
I have to take it a little step further

4134.44 --> 4141.94
alienate the enemy for yourself

4138.5 --> 4141.94
draw it out of proportions

4142.4 --> 4150.2789999999995
yeah that's what you're doing Wesley

4145.339 --> 4150.2789999999995
sure and it is naive still right now

4167.06 --> 4170.54
what the

4168.56 --> 4174.080000000001
asking receipt what are you talking

4170.54 --> 4176.259
about EEG hetero dining never heard of

4174.08 --> 4176.259
that

4194.6 --> 4202.179
I don't know jack [ __ ] okay well hey

4197.36 --> 4202.179
good get the [ __ ] out then bye

4207.89 --> 4214.42
[Music]

4211.04 --> 4214.42
you have no proof

4214.82 --> 4219.44
you're just assuming it you're not

4217.219 --> 4222.679
listening at all

4219.44 --> 4225.379999999999
and then you're giving me lip

4222.679 --> 4228.159
even though I've really carefully tried

4225.38 --> 4228.159000000001
to address it

4234.92 --> 4240.4400000000005
yeah and I I know how mind Dynamics work

4238.1 --> 4243.620000000001
I know how Spirit Dynamics work I have a

4240.44 --> 4246.04
very very fine-tuned sense

4243.62 --> 4249.679
that I've maintained and developed

4246.04 --> 4251.659
specifically to be able to do that at

4249.679 --> 4253.4
pretty much the cost of almost

4251.659 --> 4255.679
everything else that I could have

4253.4 --> 4261.379999999999
developed during my lifetime

4255.679 --> 4263.659
yeah I'm very good at doing that

4261.38 --> 4266.4400000000005
could almost say it's like my one

4263.659 --> 4266.44
skill

4266.659 --> 4274.639999999999
I know how the mind works I know how you

4270.199 --> 4278.719
can adapt to Collective thinking

4274.64 --> 4281.679
that doesn't make you a collective mind

4278.719 --> 4284.84
you have your own mind you have your own

4281.679 --> 4288.38
individual conscious and yeah you can

4284.84 --> 4291.679
shove that in the corner psychologically

4288.38 --> 4294.32
and just focus on the hive as an

4291.679 --> 4297.02
escapism it's called workaholism yeah

4294.32 --> 4299.9
that's Workaholics do that

4297.02 --> 4301.400000000001
they shove their own personal experience

4299.9 --> 4303.5
in life and

4301.4 --> 4306.0199999999995
Sensations they don't really know what

4303.5 --> 4307.159
to do with for a long time they shove it

4306.02 --> 4309.56
in the corner

4307.159 --> 4312.62
outside of their attention span and then

4309.56 --> 4314.3
they focus and give a lot of energy

4312.62 --> 4317.0
to

4314.3 --> 4318.9800000000005
the task at hand or the mindset whatever

4317.0 --> 4322.58
you're doing

4318.98 --> 4327.08
that's not a collective mind

4322.58 --> 4329.8
that's normal that's human psychological

4327.08 --> 4329.8
Behavior

4330.26 --> 4335.1990000000005
you don't know what the [ __ ] you're

4331.94 --> 4335.199
talking about Wesley sure

4335.9 --> 4338.62
not me

4340.699 --> 4343.699
foreign

4347.5 --> 4352.1
yeah you're probably gonna go full on

4350.12 --> 4354.82
gamma on me now just like Gadget

4352.1 --> 4354.820000000001
inspector did

4355.219 --> 4361.04
because once you start once you open

4358.1 --> 4363.4400000000005
that up you can't help it now you gotta

4361.04 --> 4365.0
defend your position and how I'm wrong I

4363.44 --> 4367.339999999999
know how that works

4365.0 --> 4369.86
if you could just let it go then I'll

4367.34 --> 4372.679
probably unban you at some point

4369.86 --> 4376.0599999999995
unless you're gonna gamma out on me

4372.679 --> 4376.06
and then I'm not gonna do that

4400.48 --> 4406.0599999999995
luciferous groups whole complex the sun

4403.76 --> 4408.08
is okay

4406.06 --> 4411.8
pre-ordomic man

4408.08 --> 4415.12
the terrorists are just squirting

4411.8 --> 4415.12
you're squirting man

4415.58 --> 4420.5199999999995
like you literally

4417.92 --> 4420.52
like

4420.92 --> 4426.1990000000005
that it's just a matter of Occam's razor

4423.679 --> 4427.6990000000005
it really is

4426.199 --> 4429.379999999999
I mean

4427.699 --> 4432.08
just say oh there you have this they

4429.38 --> 4436.659000000001
have that that's super overblown you're

4432.08 --> 4436.659
trying to conjure this effect into being

4440.96 --> 4446.44
when yeah

4443.42 --> 4449.179
regular non-evil

4446.44 --> 4452.839999999999
non-overly ambitious

4449.179 --> 4452.84
people can

4452.9 --> 4459.5
Forge themselves to act collectively as

4456.14 --> 4461.780000000001
well I do that all the time group

4459.5 --> 4464.96
dynamics

4461.78 --> 4468.5
to function for the group in a certain

4464.96 --> 4471.02
way to fulfill a specific role

4468.5 --> 4472.82
within the group dynamics that's

4471.02 --> 4476.0
Collective

4472.82 --> 4478.58
it's what you do it's normal

4476.0 --> 4481.04
unless you're like really bad at

4478.58 --> 4484.64
connecting with other people and then

4481.04 --> 4485.84
you're gonna kind of like Miss

4484.64 --> 4488.0
a lot of steps you're gonna

4485.84 --> 4491.4800000000005
miscommunicate you're going to ruffle

4488.0 --> 4492.62
feathers accidentally etc etc and vice

4491.48 --> 4494.36
versa

4492.62 --> 4496.28
right

4494.36 --> 4499.82
that's when you can't

4496.28 --> 4503.599999999999
click in to the collective mindset

4499.82 --> 4506.179
and this is like basic social behavior

4503.6 --> 4507.9800000000005
like you learn that as a very young kid

4506.179 --> 4510.92
that's normal

4507.98 --> 4514.159
you should be learning that because you

4510.92 --> 4517.219
need to have that skill

4514.159 --> 4521.5599999999995
like organized groups of people can't

4517.219 --> 4521.56
function unless you have that skill

4532.04 --> 4537.4
ah are you gaining wisdom

4534.8 --> 4537.400000000001
cool

4575.3 --> 4577.900000000001
right

4580.88 --> 4585.219
Oh look The truthful

4585.56 --> 4590.06
the natural all they have to do is just

4588.08 --> 4592.1
remind you

4590.06 --> 4594.5
of what is real

4592.1 --> 4596.2390000000005
because yeah all the laws are written on

4594.5 --> 4598.94
everybody's heart

4596.239 --> 4601.04
and what the darkness does is kind of

4598.94 --> 4603.32
the same but they manipulate you they

4601.04 --> 4605.36
try to trick you

4603.32 --> 4608.0599999999995
in

4605.36 --> 4610.94
having a yeah dislocated priority

4608.06 --> 4612.7390000000005
attached to something really sensitive

4610.94 --> 4614.719
and important

4612.739 --> 4616.159
right that's the manipulation it's

4614.719 --> 4618.199
really dark

4616.159 --> 4621.759999999999
so yeah the laws written on the heart

4618.199 --> 4621.759999999999
can kind of be manipulated

4621.98 --> 4625.94
but if you don't

4624.14 --> 4628.52
do that

4625.94 --> 4630.08
then yeah you'll find that if you're

4628.52 --> 4632.0
going to make a certain stand or a

4630.08 --> 4635.179
certain statement

4632.0 --> 4637.219
and you do it really focused with clean

4635.179 --> 4640.78
energy inside of you

4637.219 --> 4640.78
it's going to resonate

4648.199 --> 4650.799999999999
right

4651.739 --> 4655.4
ah

4653.659 --> 4659.0599999999995
I see Nathan's gonna have a flat Earth

4655.4 --> 4661.219
debate today looking forward to that

4659.06 --> 4663.9400000000005
and I'm gonna round out the show pretty

4661.219 --> 4663.94
soon I think

4671.84 --> 4675.32
right

4672.739 --> 4678.759999999999
you know what I'm gonna earn Ben Wesley

4675.32 --> 4678.759999999999
sure for now

4681.14 --> 4685.280000000001
I think he might have just gotten got

4683.179 --> 4686.6
caught up in the Heat of the Moment too

4685.28 --> 4689.5599999999995
much

4686.6 --> 4689.56
and we'll see

4690.98 --> 4694.699
if he can

4692.48 --> 4696.799999999999
impose himself or if he's gonna keep on

4694.699 --> 4698.9
doing this now from now on because if he

4696.8 --> 4701.38
will then I will definitely ban him

4698.9 --> 4701.379999999999
permanently

4707.06 --> 4709.54
anyway

4714.98 --> 4717.28
foreign

4733.239 --> 4738.199
controlling trillions from the Shadows

4735.679 --> 4740.179
oh Jeff gas had

4738.199 --> 4743.12
well I'm not saying that there isn't

4740.179 --> 4745.659
like spiritual entanglements out there

4743.12 --> 4745.659
as well

4749.3 --> 4754.159000000001
but that's like just a shady advisor

4752.06 --> 4757.6
thing right

4754.159 --> 4757.599999999999
it doesn't take control
