81.72 --> 87.96
there's still the cold wind

84.18 --> 89.88000000000001
from yesterday except now it's yeah it's

87.96 --> 93.0
all clouded up

89.88 --> 97.19999999999999
so it's just really cold

93.0 --> 99.36
even you had to put my heater on back

97.2 --> 103.159
behind me

99.36 --> 103.159
because it is just cold

104.399 --> 110.64
all right no rain though

107.82 --> 112.55999999999999
still dry

110.64 --> 117.02
but yeah it's

112.56 --> 117.02
this Friday is cold

118.439 --> 120.979
right

122.04 --> 125.46000000000001
so it's

123.719 --> 128.039
Friday

125.46 --> 131.039
April 2nd

128.039 --> 131.039
2021

139.58 --> 145.62
ah

141.14 --> 148.92
commentates culminated fizz

145.62 --> 152.36
good morning and Cameron Kamikaze

148.92 --> 152.35999999999999
Gilmore good to see you

160.08 --> 162.68
so

164.04 --> 167.28
yeah yesterday's show

165.4 --> 169.739
[Music]

167.28 --> 171.78
was pretty cool it was nice having

169.739 --> 173.94
sleeping Warrior on

171.78 --> 177.36
like he didn't even know he was calling

173.94 --> 179.64
during the show but this is

177.36 --> 182.94000000000003
but I just pulled him in and it was good

179.64 --> 185.599
to talk about relative density

182.94 --> 185.599
again

189.48 --> 194.599
what's on my mind today

191.76 --> 194.599
uh

195.54 --> 198.019
well

199.8 --> 206.0
what's on my mind I don't know a lot of

202.8 --> 206.0
personal stuff right now

207.0 --> 211.86
like my shoulder hurts

209.58 --> 213.54000000000002
I had a talk with my dad

211.86 --> 216.06
over the phone

213.54 --> 218.04
basically getting into the details of it

216.06 --> 221.239
and

218.04 --> 221.239
gave me some advice

225.659 --> 228.44
and

229.98 --> 232.57999999999998
foreign

232.799 --> 236.299
I'm just yeah

239.159 --> 242.64
I don't know I feel like I'm kind of in

241.2 --> 244.98
a tough spot

242.64 --> 248.22
but

244.98 --> 251.879
yeah also explain yeah it was just

248.22 --> 253.92
interesting hey hello mind Warp

251.879 --> 257.699
like the through the German new medicine

253.92 --> 261.259
the correlation of the shadow of the the

257.699 --> 261.259
shoulder what it does

261.359 --> 265.56
and

262.919 --> 268.25899999999996
the interesting perspective on that so

265.56 --> 271.04
basically when you look it up

268.259 --> 271.04
uh

271.979 --> 276.44
it basically points out that it

274.44 --> 280.259
correlates with

276.44 --> 283.5
a sensation of failure

280.259 --> 286.68
yeah but the good thing is

283.5 --> 289.44
that to take into account is that yeah

286.68 --> 291.84000000000003
if you feel that

289.44 --> 294.78
right it's almost like a prize like that

291.84 --> 296.69899999999996
if you feel it that means it's actually

294.78 --> 300.419
resolved

296.699 --> 303.74
and then when it goes away again then

300.419 --> 303.74
it's completely resolved

305.58 --> 312.18
but yes

308.039 --> 313.979
I have a lot of personal feelings and

312.18 --> 317.28000000000003
ideas about myself

313.979 --> 321.59999999999997
that aren't really reflected by others

317.28 --> 324.9
as much you know the trolls try but fail

321.6 --> 327.12
it's just that it's inside myself and a

324.9 --> 329.82
lot of the times I feel like I'm a

327.12 --> 332.28000000000003
failure like I don't have a wife I don't

329.82 --> 333.36
have kids I don't have a stable income

332.28 --> 335.58
really

333.36 --> 337.08000000000004
although I do have this show and I have

335.58 --> 340.25899999999996
you guys

337.08 --> 342.539
kind of help taking care of me

340.259 --> 344.52000000000004
through the show through your PayPal

342.539 --> 349.21999999999997
donations

344.52 --> 349.21999999999997
so it could be all it could all be worse

349.44 --> 353.539
so maybe this is like the

353.759 --> 360.0
mid-life crisis

356.16 --> 363.47900000000004
conflict resolving itself

360.0 --> 366.479
right that's a good way to look at it

363.479 --> 369.0
but I really hope it's gonna just go

366.479 --> 371.59999999999997
away at some point because it's it's

369.0 --> 371.6
painful

372.06 --> 374.78000000000003
ah

375.96 --> 382.63899999999995
right a seeking star water glad you

378.479 --> 382.639
enjoyed yesterday's show too

382.86 --> 387.0
I think the best about it is that yeah

385.199 --> 389.96000000000004
if I have somebody on you can really

387.0 --> 389.96
keep things fluid

397.08 --> 404.78
yeah Richie triple five you have a point

401.34 --> 407.75899999999996
a triple triple

404.78 --> 409.979
quintuple zero

407.759 --> 412.8
good to see you in here

409.979 --> 415.52
yeah get some peace and quiet

412.8 --> 415.52000000000004
but

419.34 --> 422.0
still

423.539 --> 429.479
in ways I think that but yeah I don't I

426.84 --> 432.35999999999996
don't know I just think that if I would

429.479 --> 434.18
have had Wife and Kids

432.36 --> 436.8
then a lot of the

434.18 --> 439.8
unrest and

436.8 --> 442.68
ego issues and self issues towards

439.8 --> 445.8
myself would be

442.68 --> 449.699
easier to resolve because I had

445.8 --> 452.699
responsibilities outside of myself to

449.699 --> 456.18
basically focus on

452.699 --> 458.22
because having all this peace and quiet

456.18 --> 460.62
also means you have

458.22 --> 464.03900000000004
silence and loneliness

460.62 --> 466.319
right that's the downside of it

464.039 --> 468.9
and it's kind of wearing on me at times

466.319 --> 471.599
now not always a lot of the times I do

468.9 --> 473.75899999999996
appreciate the quiet I'm just like yeah

471.599 --> 477.599
I can just be

473.759 --> 481.379
peaceful and relaxed and just enjoyed

477.599 --> 484.08
the beautiful sights or the nice weather

481.379 --> 487.02000000000004
or just like

484.08 --> 489.06
easily being able to enjoy superficial

487.02 --> 491.28
interactions with other peoples like

489.06 --> 494.52
other women like them looking at me

491.28 --> 497.46
having a inner response me picking up on

494.52 --> 499.639
that and being like Oh yeah well cool at

497.46 --> 499.63899999999995
least

500.34 --> 504.539
at least somebody's out there is

502.319 --> 506.34000000000003
interested right well if you have Wife

504.539 --> 510.419
and Kids it doesn't work like that at

506.34 --> 513.139
all anymore then the Dynamics shift

510.419 --> 513.139
ah

515.7 --> 519.719
the more wisdom you attain the more

517.38 --> 522.14
isolated you become yes

519.719 --> 522.1400000000001
yes

526.2 --> 531.1800000000001
right but

528.72 --> 534.6
there's also just the the overall

531.18 --> 538.56
financial situation and

534.6 --> 541.2
you guys have helped me keep going

538.56 --> 544.92
you definitely have

541.2 --> 547.019
but it seems like I can't get it in

544.92 --> 550.4399999999999
Balance really properly

547.019 --> 553.2
and every time I ask somebody

550.44 --> 555.0
they always tell me it's because you

553.2 --> 557.279
smell cannabis

555.0 --> 560.6
and it's like it hurts every time they

557.279 --> 560.6
say it because

561.36 --> 565.14
I'm really used to it

563.7 --> 569.399
I quit

565.14 --> 573.0
like decades ago one time for eight

569.399 --> 576.6
years straight and that first year was

573.0 --> 578.339
absolutely miserable

576.6 --> 581.7
like I was

578.339 --> 584.7600000000001
constant bad mood constantly

581.7 --> 586.32
like I would just not talk because every

584.76 --> 588.3
time and there was even face to face

586.32 --> 590.519
situation I would open my mouth I would

588.3 --> 592.8599999999999
say something spiteful

590.519 --> 595.019
because it was just really making me

592.86 --> 598.2
miserable

595.019 --> 601.5
and now I wonder

598.2 --> 604.62
could I do it again I got more skills I

601.5 --> 607.44
got more internal mechanism oversight

604.62 --> 609.72
better Stress Management compared to

607.44 --> 612.0600000000001
back then when I did not have oversight

609.72 --> 614.339
did not know what who I was what to do

612.06 --> 617.279
with the world anything it was a mess

614.339 --> 619.5
like that just wildly dreaming

617.279 --> 622.38
unrealistically

619.5 --> 625.76
and then quitting yeah

622.38 --> 625.76
you really feel

626.04 --> 631.399
like nothing it was depressing but maybe

631.56 --> 635.18
maybe I have to try again

635.399 --> 639.3
because yeah

637.5 --> 642.959
you know

639.3 --> 644.459
God gives you ample warning

642.959 --> 646.7399999999999
and if you don't take the warnings

644.459 --> 649.1999999999999
eventually you drown you know it's kind

646.74 --> 651.36
of ironic that I I gave that piece of

649.2 --> 653.7
advice to somebody else a roommate

651.36 --> 656.279
concerning the vaccines

653.7 --> 659.0
when I myself should probably be taking

656.279 --> 659.0
that advice

669.839 --> 677.0600000000001
if I did have a child at my age

673.14 --> 677.06
chances they're disability what

678.3 --> 684.14
that's where are you getting that from

681.3 --> 684.14
I'm a guy

685.019 --> 688.5
and I eat very healthy despite

687.06 --> 691.3199999999999
everything

688.5 --> 693.74
so I don't know where you got that from

691.32 --> 693.74
you know

694.079 --> 700.68
and who's to say that I would get a

697.019 --> 703.64
child with a woman of my age right

700.68 --> 703.64
who's saying that

703.68 --> 710.18
I don't really

705.48 --> 710.1800000000001
I hadn't really planned it like that

713.339 --> 716.339
so

718.079 --> 722.6389999999999
I don't see why he needed a timeout for

720.959 --> 725.779
that mind Warp

722.639 --> 725.779
it's a little odd

733.2 --> 739.1
boat has sailed for me right okay that

736.019 --> 739.1
is a little much

739.68 --> 745.5
yeah and I'm not going to accept because

742.32 --> 748.38
even when I'm 60

745.5 --> 753.26
I could still get a kid I could still

748.38 --> 753.26
have children right because I'm a man

755.1 --> 760.2
it is possible

757.079 --> 763.38
like even when I was with my ex

760.2 --> 765.12
we met a guy it was pretty cool

763.38 --> 766.4399999999999
whose dad

765.12 --> 770.639
was

766.44 --> 774.3000000000001
it 55 when he got him

770.639 --> 777.98
with his wife of 30.

774.3 --> 777.9799999999999
right that is possible

778.44 --> 782.22
now I'm not saying that oh I plan to get

780.6 --> 785.279
a kid in

782.22 --> 789.72
15 years or something this is

785.279 --> 794.1
or fifth 25 years what is it yeah no

789.72 --> 798.0790000000001
damn I'm getting old 15 years

794.1 --> 798.0790000000001
but it's not an issue

800.459 --> 807.66
and besides I'm still very

803.88 --> 812.06
young physically for my age

807.66 --> 812.06
so I don't see the issues here

815.339 --> 819.6
yeah mine's warped no yeah I get it I

818.519 --> 822.36
get it

819.6 --> 825.3000000000001
it's it's a little border

822.36 --> 828.24
It's On the Border

825.3 --> 830.2199999999999
but I also thought it was just wrong

828.24 --> 832.5600000000001
so that part I didn't really understand

830.22 --> 834.899
it's a very strange thing to say against

832.56 --> 836.0999999999999
them to a man like oh after a certain

834.899 --> 840.5
age

836.1 --> 840.5
you gotta give up no no

840.959 --> 844.0999999999999
absolutely not

849.18 --> 853.9399999999999
all right anyway lots of people rolling

851.339 --> 853.94
into chat

856.199 --> 859.88
taking star Waters here

862.56 --> 865.04
huh

868.38 --> 872.899
oh is it talking about flat earth right

874.32 --> 879.24
but yeah it's wearing a little only I

877.44 --> 882.3000000000001
think I have to quit because my

879.24 --> 885.42
financial situation isn't allowing it

882.3 --> 889.199
I had kind of dreamed that the amount of

885.42 --> 891.36
support would be increasing over time

889.199 --> 894.24
it's not

891.36 --> 895.92
I mean you guys have the ones that are

894.24 --> 899.519
supporting me here

895.92 --> 901.3199999999999
have really helped me out a lot

899.519 --> 902.76
and I really hope you continue doing

901.32 --> 906.0790000000001
that

902.76 --> 906.079
it's just that

907.38 --> 913.32
you have the the people there's not

910.199 --> 919.079
other people out there that seem to just

913.32 --> 922.1990000000001
get in here and also add to that which I

919.079 --> 924.06
hoped I hoped it would grow but

922.199 --> 927.3
then again

924.06 --> 929.0999999999999
maybe the way I do my show and

927.3 --> 931.62
everything and with all the silent

929.1 --> 934.1990000000001
pauses which are still there with I see

931.62 --> 937.32
it as a problem it's not a terrible

934.199 --> 940.4399999999999
problem but it is especially a problem

937.32 --> 943.32
for a lot of people their attention

940.44 --> 945.6
you know there's so many streamers out

943.32 --> 947.519
there that do regular streams that never

945.6 --> 950.279
have that problem ever

947.519 --> 952.259
like they always they can always keep on

950.279 --> 954.6
rolling and I have trouble with that

952.259 --> 956.5790000000001
sometimes

954.6 --> 958.5
especially when there's things in the

956.579 --> 961.199
back of my mind that I really don't

958.5 --> 963.68
think is wise to share because it's not

961.199 --> 966.92
gonna help anybody

963.68 --> 966.92
including myself

969.0 --> 974.36
so

970.32 --> 974.36
I guess this is the way it's gonna be

977.04 --> 981.959
and

978.06 --> 984.4799999999999
I'm willing to at least entertain an

981.959 --> 987.42
experiment with it to see like okay is

984.48 --> 991.0790000000001
it really going to even out my financial

987.42 --> 993.66
situation if I completely quit smoking

991.079 --> 995.7589999999999
and is it doable like isn't there going

993.66 --> 998.759
to be like a backlash psychological

995.759 --> 999.779
response that makes me just go Manic and

998.759 --> 1002.6
just

999.779 --> 1004.16
throw the money away another way

1002.6 --> 1007.639
because that's kind of what I'm also

1004.16 --> 1010.9399999999999
nervous for because every time

1007.639 --> 1012.639
start to maneuver and maneuver somewhere

1010.94 --> 1016.8800000000001
else

1012.639 --> 1020.1800000000001
impulses make me do rash things I hate

1016.88 --> 1023.36
it I hate that it happens

1020.18 --> 1026.12
and I'm working very hard on the

1023.36 --> 1028.459
prevention of this but that causes also

1026.12 --> 1030.1989999999998
stress it's almost like a condition like

1028.459 --> 1032.9
oh you're gonna break free you're gonna

1030.199 --> 1035.419
maneuver to another position in your

1032.9 --> 1038.9
life you must

1035.419 --> 1041.9
pay literally pay money price for that

1038.9 --> 1045.679
in some way some useless way to the

1041.9 --> 1048.26
universe I that's how it feels sometimes

1045.679 --> 1049.2800000000002
to me every time try to maneuver out of

1048.26 --> 1052.28
a

1049.28 --> 1055.52
set up into something else

1052.28 --> 1058.46
it never comes down no it's always

1055.52 --> 1061.22
oh so there is a possibility things

1058.46 --> 1062.32
might be different spend spend spend

1061.22 --> 1066.28
spend

1062.32 --> 1066.28
it's terrible

1068.179 --> 1072.5590000000002
it's not even that I do it it's just

1070.4 --> 1075.039
that I get those impulses and I freaking

1072.559 --> 1075.039
hate it

1081.2 --> 1086.539
but uh

1083.48 --> 1089.72
right I'm gonna try this you know I I

1086.539 --> 1092.84
think I it's if I get some more

1089.72 --> 1095.419
donations in the coming weeks which I

1092.84 --> 1098.24
definitely require to get around

1095.419 --> 1101.419
even without smoking

1098.24 --> 1103.7
then yeah I'll just have to do that and

1101.419 --> 1108.4
see what happens maybe there will be

1103.7 --> 1108.4
some improvement in my performance

1111.2 --> 1116.0
because I think also that the smoking of

1113.6 --> 1118.539
the Cannabis has a weird trade-off

1116.0 --> 1118.539
where

1123.559 --> 1129.3799999999999
dude foulan

1125.36 --> 1132.34
dude shut the [ __ ] up

1129.38 --> 1132.3400000000001
how about that

1133.039 --> 1136.84
yeah shut up

1138.74 --> 1143.96
I don't give a [ __ ] what your science

1140.9 --> 1145.94
says I don't give a [ __ ] in general what

1143.96 --> 1148.16
sign says

1145.94 --> 1149.8400000000001
stop talking about that or I'm kicking

1148.16 --> 1152.38
you out

1149.84 --> 1152.3799999999999
all right

1163.2 --> 1166.239
[Music]

1166.4 --> 1171.74
ever considered that maybe the increase

1169.4 --> 1174.26
in age yielding

1171.74 --> 1177.02
less than desirable results in

1174.26 --> 1179.72
procreation has something to do

1177.02 --> 1182.4189999999999
with societal pollution

1179.72 --> 1185.84
the preponderance of unhealth healthy

1182.419 --> 1188.96
eating habits the compounding of

1185.84 --> 1191.72
vaccination habits maybe that has

1188.96 --> 1194.9
something to do with it and not just age

1191.72 --> 1197.84
ever considered that

1194.9 --> 1200.6000000000001
you think that that was included in the

1197.84 --> 1204.799
study that that those variables will

1200.6 --> 1208.4599999999998
isolate it I don't think so right

1204.799 --> 1211.72
freaking drop it I'm kicking you out

1208.46 --> 1211.72
it's the last warning

1233.299 --> 1238.6399999999999
hello Bogart

1236.059 --> 1240.74
I'll say rid

1238.64 --> 1243.94
thanks for popping by

1240.74 --> 1243.94
zero skip

1253.76 --> 1256.299
right

1256.58 --> 1263.299
but yeah in doing pseudoscience or just

1260.14 --> 1266.539
hearsay nonsense

1263.299 --> 1270.02
you know there's a lot of indoctrination

1266.539 --> 1272.12
nonsense going out under the guise of

1270.02 --> 1275.12
supposed science

1272.12 --> 1276.9799999999998
and then statistical studies so every

1275.12 --> 1279.02
time somebody presents you with that

1276.98 --> 1280.58
like foulon Buchanan apparently got

1279.02 --> 1283.1589999999999
caught up in

1280.58 --> 1286.82
you gotta present

1283.159 --> 1290.0
how how was this figured out you know

1286.82 --> 1292.3999999999999
you can't just say a study tells you

1290.0 --> 1295.9
this that's crap

1292.4 --> 1299.72
that's literally social engineering

1295.9 --> 1304.159
manipulation of ideas of people

1299.72 --> 1307.1000000000001
unless it's you can look into it and see

1304.159 --> 1308.419
if within the process of coming to that

1307.1 --> 1312.6999999999998
conclusion

1308.419 --> 1312.7
they isolated all the variables right

1313.52 --> 1318.62
so yeah

1314.96 --> 1321.8600000000001
undoing pseudoscience indeed

1318.62 --> 1324.4599999999998
it applies to everything not just the

1321.86 --> 1324.4599999999998
cosmogony

1327.27 --> 1330.329
[Applause]

1334.94 --> 1338.8400000000001
right Flat Earth debate yesterday was

1336.86 --> 1340.6999999999998
also pretty cool

1338.84 --> 1342.3799999999999
it's active

1340.7 --> 1345.4
are in there

1342.38 --> 1350.0590000000002
Ballers got into

1345.4 --> 1353.1200000000001
uh that's gonna be back on Saturday so

1350.059 --> 1357.52
can't wait to hear that back I usually

1353.12 --> 1357.52
enjoy watching back the shows

1357.74 --> 1360.52
uh

1362.539 --> 1366.799
right oh before this today before the

1365.24 --> 1368.659
show started I also watched some tea

1366.799 --> 1370.8799999999999
time with Gary and Terry

1368.659 --> 1375.919
was interesting piece

1370.88 --> 1379.3400000000001
about like a capturing Matrix about how

1375.919 --> 1381.2
to basically gradually condition a a

1379.34 --> 1383.8999999999999
group of hogs

1381.2 --> 1387.559
to

1383.9 --> 1389.659
to get into a fenced environment

1387.559 --> 1391.34
without stressing them out or making

1389.659 --> 1393.6200000000001
them feel captured

1391.34 --> 1395.9599999999998
how to condition them is very

1393.62 --> 1398.84
straightforward very

1395.96 --> 1402.679
clear-cut how that worked very clearly

1398.84 --> 1405.4399999999998
presented and it was an interesting

1402.679 --> 1408.74
interesting piece of information to

1405.44 --> 1412.5800000000002
consider as to how humans in similar

1408.74 --> 1415.22
ways are also being socially engineered

1412.58 --> 1419.1999999999998
and Owen Benjamin put that down quite

1415.22 --> 1419.2
clearly so I appreciated that

1423.18 --> 1426.249
[Music]

1447.26 --> 1449.799
right

1452.72 --> 1459.5
well yeah Bogan also read

1457.76 --> 1461.9
I'm going to get to the root of the data

1459.5 --> 1464.36
the origins of bull crap

1461.9 --> 1466.159
of the bull crap you'll find is often

1464.36 --> 1467.3799999999999
faulty foundations right and that

1466.159 --> 1470.9
applies

1467.38 --> 1474.6200000000001
to flowerland's suggestion too because

1470.9 --> 1478.52
he told me like it applied to me

1474.62 --> 1481.82
when obviously as I explained yeah sure

1478.52 --> 1486.32
it will apply statistically

1481.82 --> 1489.26
to the average of everyone but why could

1486.32 --> 1493.22
it have to do perhaps

1489.26 --> 1495.74
with the average people's habits

1493.22 --> 1498.6200000000001
their condition what they subject

1495.74 --> 1500.059
themselves to over time and then yeah at

1498.62 --> 1502.34
some point

1500.059 --> 1505.58
if you're among those people that do

1502.34 --> 1508.279
that then yeah the age Factor

1505.58 --> 1510.9189999999999
is correlatory it's not causal it's

1508.279 --> 1513.14
correlatory because of what they

1510.919 --> 1516.38
actually did in all that time yeah it

1513.14 --> 1518.24
might lead to those types of

1516.38 --> 1519.38
conception issues

1518.24 --> 1523.64
right

1519.38 --> 1526.7
but that does not apply to me I'm pretty

1523.64 --> 1530.2990000000002
damn certain it doesn't

1526.7 --> 1532.279
right that's how you undo it that's how

1530.299 --> 1535.52
you undo that

1532.279 --> 1538.94
also I thought I don't know why he said

1535.52 --> 1540.98
that it's like a very dark thing to say

1538.94 --> 1543.0800000000002
to somebody in my position

1540.98 --> 1545.299
it's literally saying like I feel bad

1543.08 --> 1547.34
for not having

1545.299 --> 1549.679
kids and a wife

1547.34 --> 1552.9189999999999
to say that like yeah the window is

1549.679 --> 1555.5
close give it up no no absolutely not

1552.919 --> 1557.0590000000002
that's intolerable

1555.5 --> 1559.58
right

1557.059 --> 1562.52
if somebody is gonna give up such a

1559.58 --> 1566.98
thing that's big

1562.52 --> 1566.98
and you shouldn't push them into it ever

1573.62 --> 1582.02
it it gives up a off a very creepy

1577.84 --> 1583.82
Eugenics vibe to me when somebody does

1582.02 --> 1586.48
that

1583.82 --> 1588.3799999999999
I'm glad I spotted it and was able to

1586.48 --> 1591.22
diffuse it

1588.38 --> 1591.22
with information

1596.02 --> 1603.22
ah okay commented fizz

1600.62 --> 1603.2199999999998
is this

1613.64 --> 1618.3200000000002
you need yeah oh wow

1623.72 --> 1632.48
so culminated Fizz like distance visible

1628.7 --> 1634.5800000000002
so are you assuming that

1632.48 --> 1636.679
these things

1634.58 --> 1639.5
out there are visible

1636.679 --> 1641.72
or not visible at some point at some

1639.5 --> 1644.179
distance because Earth curve is blocking

1641.72 --> 1645.679
it is that what you think

1644.179 --> 1647.779
because I'm pretty sure that the

1645.679 --> 1651.1000000000001
geometric Horizon

1647.779 --> 1651.1
has been disproven

1651.98 --> 1655.58
like

1653.299 --> 1658.96
The Horizon does not abide by

1655.58 --> 1658.96
geometrical standards

1659.299 --> 1665.12
it's not in the right place

1662.36 --> 1667.1589999999999
and it would always have to be in the

1665.12 --> 1669.82
right place in order for it to be

1667.159 --> 1669.8200000000002
geometric

1677.72 --> 1681.58
or you're doing the math on that though

1683.059 --> 1687.58
oh why don't you do the math on it then

1697.88 --> 1703.88
well she doesn't need to commit this she

1701.84 --> 1705.559
doesn't need to there's plenty of Black

1703.88 --> 1708.44
Swan observations

1705.559 --> 1711.7
you only need one Black Swan to disprove

1708.44 --> 1711.7
that all swans are white

1729.799 --> 1736.279
hey if seeking star water saw

1733.1 --> 1738.559
a extremely far distance sight at

1736.279 --> 1742.399
minimal observation height yeah then you

1738.559 --> 1745.8799999999999
could say oh look I saw a Black Swan

1742.399 --> 1749.08
look again the site does not abide by

1745.88 --> 1749.0800000000002
the spherical geometry

1749.779 --> 1754.039
you know

1751.399 --> 1758.7199999999998
that doesn't mean that because she says

1754.039 --> 1761.12
that she has to calculate it

1758.72 --> 1765.14
you know because flat earthers don't

1761.12 --> 1767.4799999999998
really claim the Earth is a sphere

1765.14 --> 1770.3600000000001
with the natural consequences that come

1767.48 --> 1774.58
with it mainly The Horizon being the

1770.36 --> 1774.58
sphere Edge blocking side behind it

1775.76 --> 1777.8799999999999
thank you

1778.62 --> 1781.78
[Music]

1791.96 --> 1797.179
yeah well I

1794.539 --> 1800.24
I'm not really interested interested if

1797.179 --> 1802.64
you are gonna do the math for it

1800.24 --> 1805.22
Jay if you want to do the math for it to

1802.64 --> 1807.6200000000001
basically confirm

1805.22 --> 1811.039
that it is a Black Swan observation then

1807.62 --> 1812.84
go ahead but don't expect us to get all

1811.039 --> 1814.64
excited for it

1812.84 --> 1818.4399999999998
because we don't have a claim that the

1814.64 --> 1818.44
Earth is a sphere or has a radius

1828.26 --> 1832.899
hello Dean right good to see you in chat

1841.54 --> 1846.339
[Music]

1872.12 --> 1875.84
the ditch seeking star order did you

1874.82 --> 1877.8799999999999
tell

1875.84 --> 1881.4399999999998
did you share the observation height

1877.88 --> 1881.44
it's kind of important

1882.019 --> 1888.46
for if you want to try and calculate

1884.84 --> 1888.4599999999998
what it would be like on the globe

1891.679 --> 1897.679
scrolling that not back now to see if

1894.14 --> 1901.039
you mentioned anything about hype

1897.679 --> 1902.48
22 miles across

1901.039 --> 1905.98
right

1902.48 --> 1905.98
so no height mentioned then

1914.24 --> 1918.74
standing on the shore viewing from the

1916.399 --> 1921.3799999999999
shore Okay so

1918.74 --> 1924.38
how high is that

1921.38 --> 1928.64
is that like

1924.38 --> 1931.3600000000001
five feet six feet observation height

1928.64 --> 1931.3600000000001
what is it

1936.919 --> 1941.96
okay well there you go now you got now

1939.559 --> 1943.96
you got some calculable data I don't

1941.96 --> 1947.0
even know how this culminated Fizz guy

1943.96 --> 1948.919
was going to calculate any of that in

1947.0 --> 1951.88
the first place without you even sharing

1948.919 --> 1951.88
the observation height

1954.26 --> 1959.2
six thousand foot elevation what

1959.539 --> 1962.919
the hell are you talking about

1973.46 --> 1977.6200000000001
it doesn't matter if it has an elevation

1980.059 --> 1986.0
right even look if it is supposedly

1982.82 --> 1988.72
higher than sea level

1986.0 --> 1992.899
okay so now

1988.72 --> 1996.44
the presumed radius of which you're

1992.899 --> 2000.6399999999999
looking over should be slightly bigger

1996.44 --> 2003.94
right so how much will that Inc or will

2000.64 --> 2006.8200000000002
that decrease the required drop

2003.94 --> 2009.5800000000002
for a spherical geometry

2006.82 --> 2012.6399999999999
very little it's still a five feet

2009.58 --> 2016.26
observation height and what did you say

2012.64 --> 2016.26
again 22 miles

2016.48 --> 2022.2
I'm pretty sure that's still not gonna

2018.279 --> 2022.2
abide by spherical geometry

2033.1 --> 2040.84
really so yeah on this six

2037.48 --> 2045.72
thousand foot increased above the

2040.84 --> 2045.72
standard presumed Earth spherical radius

2046.14 --> 2051.7200000000003
2022 mild distant observation at five

2049.179 --> 2051.7200000000003
foot height

2052.48 --> 2057.899
so how does that work

2055.24 --> 2057.899
right

2058.659 --> 2064.48
did you I don't need to calculate it I

2061.359 --> 2066.7599999999998
can just size it up observation height

2064.48 --> 2068.379
distance observation height distance

2066.76 --> 2070.119
right

2068.379 --> 2074.339
how would that work on a sphere it's

2070.119 --> 2074.339
very simple you wouldn't see [ __ ]

2076.48 --> 2080.859
you wouldn't be able to see the shore on

2078.399 --> 2084.04
the other side it would be blocked by

2080.859 --> 2087.419
the body of water in between

2084.04 --> 2087.419
if you were on a sphere

2089.8 --> 2097.96
so I don't need to numerically calculate

2094.48 --> 2099.7
that to quickly size it up as

2097.96 --> 2101.44
spherically impossible

2099.7 --> 2104.02
right

2101.44 --> 2108.7000000000003
I'm not afraid of math I just don't give

2104.02 --> 2113.44
a [ __ ] buddy I don't give a [ __ ]

2108.7 --> 2116.9199999999996
I don't need numbers to quickly size up

2113.44 --> 2118.48
the scenario and disprove geometry and

2116.92 --> 2122.339
now you're getting the [ __ ] out of here

2118.48 --> 2122.339
get the [ __ ] out of my chat [ __ ]

2130.24 --> 2133.14
foreign

2142.65 --> 2145.76
[Music]

2149.92 --> 2157.119
yeah you can go to a a math forum

2154.3 --> 2159.28
and start a math squirting all over the

2157.119 --> 2162.7000000000003
place why don't you go to a math forum

2159.28 --> 2166.0
and prove mathematically oh at six foot

2162.7 --> 2167.7999999999997
six thousand foot elevation height above

2166.0 --> 2170.98
sea level

2167.8 --> 2172.6600000000003
yeah the 22 Mile distant observation at

2170.98 --> 2174.88
five foot observation height how that

2172.66 --> 2178.66
proves the globe okay you go and do that

2174.88 --> 2182.56
over there over here I don't give a [ __ ]

2178.66 --> 2187.14
right I don't need to calculate to know

2182.56 --> 2187.14
that that is spherically impossible

2188.26 --> 2190.8
foreign

2214.5 --> 2217.67
[Music]

2218.92 --> 2223.5
God he was spamming my check with that

2221.14 --> 2223.5
crap

2233.079 --> 2236.28
all right uh

2245.47 --> 2248.5899999999997
[Music]

2252.4 --> 2254.579
foreign

2258.06 --> 2265.2
I don't think it was a sock I think it

2260.619 --> 2265.2000000000003
was just a glober doing a globe thing

2267.339 --> 2273.18
I don't think he was like a troll he was

2269.74 --> 2273.18
just not listening

2277.119 --> 2282.7000000000003
right and then when you have that

2279.64 --> 2285.16
terrible terrible hap habit

2282.7 --> 2288.3999999999996
of telling people that you don't

2285.16 --> 2290.56
understand or whatever because you're

2288.4 --> 2292.7200000000003
not engaging in math

2290.56 --> 2295.18
that's the moment where I kick you out

2292.72 --> 2297.7599999999998
and tell you to get the [ __ ] out

2295.18 --> 2298.8999999999996
because I'm not wasting my time on that

2297.76 --> 2301.3590000000004
[ __ ]

2298.9 --> 2304.48
I already laid down the argument without

2301.359 --> 2308.5
the math you don't need the math the

2304.48 --> 2311.44
math is only a tool to assist to get a

2308.5 --> 2314.74
little bit more precise when it matters

2311.44 --> 2317.7400000000002
right or when you have a 22 Mile

2314.74 --> 2320.9199999999996
observation of a shore

2317.74 --> 2323.5
at a 5 foot observation height it

2320.92 --> 2327.04
doesn't matter what the numerics will

2323.5 --> 2327.82
yield I know this is impossible on the

2327.04 --> 2331.119
sphere

2327.82 --> 2333.6600000000003
I don't need to calculate it whether it

2331.119 --> 2333.6600000000003
is or not

2349.01 --> 2352.4990000000003
[Music]

2356.38 --> 2362.04
all right

2358.8 --> 2362.04
so anyway

2362.8 --> 2365.8790000000004
[Music]

2369.94 --> 2375.88
so if you like my work please consider

2373.599 --> 2378.4
I'm gonna do some of this

2375.88 --> 2382.98
please do consider

2378.4 --> 2382.98
donating to my PayPal I do need it

2383.88 --> 2388.8
and it's day over in the background

2393.46 --> 2397.66
ah

2394.9 --> 2400.3
I can really use the support

2397.66 --> 2403.06
in this case for food

2400.3 --> 2404.7400000000002
because I yeah unless like some insane

2403.06 --> 2407.38
amount comes rolling in and I don't

2404.74 --> 2409.839
think so and with insane I truly mean

2407.38 --> 2411.7000000000003
insane and that really hasn't happened

2409.839 --> 2414.819
so far

2411.7 --> 2417.8799999999997
like I don't foresee how I can just keep

2414.819 --> 2421.54
on going still smoking cannabis

2417.88 --> 2424.599
also maybe if I stop smoking then my

2421.54 --> 2427.7799999999997
shoulder situation will kind of

2424.599 --> 2430.7200000000003
die down a little

2427.78 --> 2433.6600000000003
because I don't know if

2430.72 --> 2436.839
in the last few weeks I I am starting to

2433.66 --> 2441.04
spot a correlation like the smoking is

2436.839 --> 2443.56
not helping it at least so maybe then if

2441.04 --> 2448.0
I quit it's it'll stop

2443.56 --> 2450.54
I hope certainly hope so and who knows I

2448.0 --> 2453.04
could at least use the

2450.54 --> 2456.4
the soberness

2453.04 --> 2458.8
to maybe cut down on the silent moments

2456.4 --> 2460.9
on my show because I think I don't know

2458.8 --> 2463.7400000000002
in retrospect I think it also has to do

2460.9 --> 2463.7400000000002
with cannabis

2464.8 --> 2469.78
especially when I smoke right before I

2467.56 --> 2472.66
start the show

2469.78 --> 2475.0600000000004
it's better to kind of wait like to

2472.66 --> 2477.16
smoke when I did did it it's always

2475.06 --> 2480.359
better to smoke like not right before

2477.16 --> 2480.359
but like half an hour

2480.76 --> 2485.94
and then I don't have it as much

2483.22 --> 2485.9399999999996
but anyway

2486.88 --> 2489.599
uh

2493.599 --> 2499.3
right anybody else

2496.599 --> 2502.599
I have a subject to discuss

2499.3 --> 2505.1400000000003
besides the math of seeking star Waters

2502.599 --> 2505.1400000000003
observation

2518.14 --> 2522.52
all right there was no brandons

2520.3 --> 2525.3590000000004
yesterday there was only a Premiere I

2522.52 --> 2525.359
didn't really watch it

2549.88 --> 2554.04
otherwise I'm just gonna go digging

2577.119 --> 2583.359
right at least yeah the according to the

2581.2 --> 2584.98
Dutch alternative news

2583.359 --> 2586.74
there is

2584.98 --> 2589.66
like this

2586.74 --> 2592.2999999999997
situation with our cabinet is coming to

2589.66 --> 2596.02
a culmination more and more

2592.3 --> 2600.48
so that's at least

2596.02 --> 2600.48
uh somewhat comforting

2601.0 --> 2604.66
everybody's sick of the lockdowns and

2603.16 --> 2607.0
the corona measures people are saying

2604.66 --> 2609.16
like no this is just the flu we should

2607.0 --> 2610.72
treat it as just the flu and stop all

2609.16 --> 2614.5
this craziness

2610.72 --> 2617.02
vaccines aren't really vaccines

2614.5 --> 2619.0
and yeah everybody's sick of the Prime

2617.02 --> 2622.119
Minister and

2619.0 --> 2625.2
and the way he does things

2622.119 --> 2628.839
so a lot of reading some in-depth

2625.2 --> 2631.18
articles about just how things happen

2628.839 --> 2633.4
with the

2631.18 --> 2636.3999999999996
different government

2633.4 --> 2636.4
compartments

2639.339 --> 2643.119
and how that's messing up so yeah I'm

2641.56 --> 2645.7
reading up

2643.119 --> 2648.54
and there is a lot out there

2645.7 --> 2648.54
right now

2650.8 --> 2655.78
and I'm glad that there's just more

2653.319 --> 2658.96
attention on this it's helpful for me

2655.78 --> 2661.48
and it's definitely necessary for the

2658.96 --> 2662.56
country I think for my country

2661.48 --> 2664.54
right

2662.56 --> 2667.319
apparently it just

2664.54 --> 2667.319
what is this

2668.5 --> 2671.099
hoof

2677.38 --> 2681.2200000000003
okay

2678.78 --> 2683.5600000000004
according to this article apparently

2681.22 --> 2686.4399999999996
Russia is sending a whole bunch of Tanks

2683.56 --> 2688.7799999999997
to the border with Ukraine so that

2686.44 --> 2691.3
there's tensions rising over there and

2688.78 --> 2695.02
it's worrisome because of course Ukraine

2691.3 --> 2697.599
is tied into the Europe situation

2695.02 --> 2701.319
so this is threatening

2697.599 --> 2703.6600000000003
not saying it is unjustified

2701.319 --> 2705.88
because Ukraine has been kind of a mess

2703.66 --> 2708.96
situation

2705.88 --> 2708.96
for a long time

2716.98 --> 2723.16
right but yeah I don't know the the

2720.46 --> 2725.2
media people writing they say oh world

2723.16 --> 2727.1189999999997
is getting ready for the third world war

2725.2 --> 2731.7599999999998
blah

2727.119 --> 2731.76
well maybe maybe that will happen

2741.22 --> 2745.24
I don't know so yeah that's just me

2743.56 --> 2747.52
scrolling through that

2745.24 --> 2750.06
oh check my PayPal

2747.52 --> 2750.06
oh

2750.64 --> 2755.339
heard that in a while

2752.68 --> 2755.339
check it out

2766.18 --> 2772.839
oh wow

2768.7 --> 2774.5789999999997
is this your first PayPal donation

2772.839 --> 2776.68
because I'm the first time I'm seeing

2774.579 --> 2779.2000000000003
that name wow thank you so much that's

2776.68 --> 2782.02
that's very generous of you I really

2779.2 --> 2784.18
appreciate that

2782.02 --> 2787.5
that is

2784.18 --> 2787.5
that is going to help

2788.26 --> 2793.119
I can already feel myself getting fed in

2791.68 --> 2795.8799999999997
the future by it

2793.119 --> 2799.6800000000003
thank you very much seeking star water I

2795.88 --> 2799.6800000000003
really appreciate that thank you so much

2800.56 --> 2803.2799999999997
huh

2804.52 --> 2810.7599999999998
back at you

2807.28 --> 2814.119
I'm really glad that

2810.76 --> 2815.0200000000004
that you are appreciating my activities

2814.119 --> 2818.6800000000003
because

2815.02 --> 2821.5
I am basically at your service

2818.68 --> 2823.7799999999997
all of you guys in my chat it is what I

2821.5 --> 2827.38
try to do I try to be

2823.78 --> 2830.26
like an open arbitrary somebody you can

2827.38 --> 2831.88
ask questions complicated questions that

2830.26 --> 2834.099
you might not even realize how

2831.88 --> 2835.78
complicated they are I'll be able to

2834.099 --> 2837.28
figure that out it's something I

2835.78 --> 2841.3590000000004
typically do

2837.28 --> 2844.48
and I'm glad that

2841.359 --> 2846.52
I'm of use basically because that's

2844.48 --> 2849.04
really what it's all about

2846.52 --> 2852.16
that I'm at least having a

2849.04 --> 2854.68
an effect a positive effect on people to

2852.16 --> 2856.5989999999997
the level that they feel

2854.68 --> 2859.7799999999997
not forced

2856.599 --> 2861.6400000000003
but just like I don't know spiritually

2859.78 --> 2863.1400000000003
obligated I don't know it's a little I

2861.64 --> 2865.24
don't know how to describe it but they

2863.14 --> 2866.859
feel it's worth it I really appreciate

2865.24 --> 2868.7799999999997
that thank you so much seeking star

2866.859 --> 2870.96
water

2868.78 --> 2870.96
foreign

2872.92 --> 2875.92
that's

2876.22 --> 2880.5989999999997
that's crazy

2878.26 --> 2884.5200000000004
like literally the pain levels in my

2880.599 --> 2884.52
shoulder just don't went down 30 percent

2887.26 --> 2892.2000000000003
that's crazy

2889.66 --> 2892.2
oh

2892.24 --> 2897.9599999999996
literally I

2894.819 --> 2897.96
didn't see that coming

2898.72 --> 2903.2799999999997
anyway

2900.94 --> 2905.38
and let's continue with this with the

2903.28 --> 2907.9
show

2905.38 --> 2911.7000000000003
right so

2907.9 --> 2911.7000000000003
that situation is happening

2926.74 --> 2929.64
what uh

2950.079 --> 2952.619
what

2968.14 --> 2971.46
oh goody

2978.099 --> 2984.04
okay I'm just reading quickly glancing

2981.46 --> 2985.96
through this RT article

2984.04 --> 2989.2599999999998
where they basically just say this

2985.96 --> 2992.2
woodnik vaccine is

2989.26 --> 2994.9
it is genetically engineered

2992.2 --> 2997.2999999999997
it is a genetic engineering thing they

2994.9 --> 3001.2200000000003
just say it and then say how it's

2997.3 --> 3001.2200000000003
supposed to protect it this is just

3007.2 --> 3011.18
all right so it's not a placebo

3012.0 --> 3017.599
all right so if you want to squirt over

3014.339 --> 3017.599
that some take a look

3045.9 --> 3048.44
oh

3060.18 --> 3066.18
hmm okay this is interesting

3063.24 --> 3069.18
that's an article on RT about the Dutch

3066.18 --> 3071.7
Parliament and a vote of no confidence

3069.18 --> 3073.68
situation which he apparently barely

3071.7 --> 3075.839
escaped from what like that's apparent

3073.68 --> 3078.14
the whole situation is even echoing on

3075.839 --> 3078.14
to

3078.599 --> 3083.119
new sources outside of the country so

3088.38 --> 3090.98
right

3092.28 --> 3095.059
hmm

3099.48 --> 3105.68
it will destroy the immune system well

3101.819 --> 3105.68
I'm certainly not gonna trust it

3112.98 --> 3118.7400000000002
like it's just there is no safe Corona

3116.52 --> 3121.2
vaccine there is none

3118.74 --> 3124.2
only safe Corona vaccine would be a

3121.2 --> 3127.98
saline solution Placebo that has nothing

3124.2 --> 3131.3999999999996
in it that's the only safe vaccine

3127.98 --> 3134.94
the corona vaccine the only safe vaccine

3131.4 --> 3137.52
against Corona is no vaccine

3134.94 --> 3140.4
because I don't think you can vaccinate

3137.52 --> 3142.74
it they're trying to experiment to kind

3140.4 --> 3147.119
of get rid of

3142.74 --> 3149.0989999999997
flu and cold I guess trying to do it

3147.119 --> 3151.6400000000003
through genetic engineering but this is

3149.099 --> 3154.2000000000003
all highly experimental

3151.64 --> 3155.8799999999997
and I could pretty much guarantee it's

3154.2 --> 3158.54
not gonna work because it's based on

3155.88 --> 3162.359
completely faulty medical models

3158.54 --> 3165.119
assuming viral infection

3162.359 --> 3167.94
right and as soon as you in a medical

3165.119 --> 3171.9
model and this is my opinion as a Layman

3167.94 --> 3173.88
and I have sources for this that are not

3171.9 --> 3175.079
really officially accepted surprise

3173.88 --> 3178.7000000000003
surprise

3175.079 --> 3181.7400000000002
yeah as soon as you say viral infection

3178.7 --> 3184.6189999999997
immediately it's all wrong

3181.74 --> 3187.5
immediately so if you're going to assume

3184.619 --> 3189.599
any kind of action medically

3187.5 --> 3192.54
by that standard

3189.599 --> 3195.8590000000004
it's immediately wrong

3192.54 --> 3195.859
because that's not what it is

3197.88 --> 3203.4
right so yeah to assume that it will

3200.579 --> 3205.619
destroy the immune system I'm not saying

3203.4 --> 3208.079
just a rush you know every freaking one

3205.619 --> 3211.44
out there every single one out there

3208.079 --> 3212.76
that is part of this project this Corona

3211.44 --> 3215.28
project

3212.76 --> 3217.0200000000004
it's very likely they will all destroy

3215.28 --> 3219.78
your immune system and also it's been

3217.02 --> 3221.339
said that the very proteins that are

3219.78 --> 3224.1600000000003
being changed and all that will

3221.339 --> 3226.92
typically result

3224.16 --> 3231.2
into

3226.92 --> 3231.2000000000003
what is it again yeah into

3231.619 --> 3238.02
Alzheimer's

3233.46 --> 3240.599
like this is the primary thing that the

3238.02 --> 3241.74
altering of the proteins will have as a

3240.599 --> 3243.96
result

3241.74 --> 3246.24
getting this through multiple sources

3243.96 --> 3248.7
that are relaying it through much more

3246.24 --> 3251.4599999999996
in-depth research that is going to build

3248.7 --> 3254.46
this plaque in certain spots of the

3251.46 --> 3256.5
brain because of the that protein that

3254.46 --> 3259.7400000000002
altered protein and that will literally

3256.5 --> 3262.22
result in Alzheimer's that's what I got

3259.74 --> 3262.22
from it

3263.819 --> 3269.22
so the more of these protein alteration

3267.319 --> 3271.8
experiments you're going to inject in

3269.22 --> 3273.24
yourself the quicker this process will

3271.8 --> 3275.52
happen

3273.24 --> 3279.9199999999996
the quicker you will get Alzheimer's

3275.52 --> 3283.92
that's my prediction based on widespread

3279.92 --> 3285.48
Gathering through sources

3283.92 --> 3286.619
what's going to happen so that's my

3285.48 --> 3289.44
prediction

3286.619 --> 3292.44
giant Alzheimer's epidemics

3289.44 --> 3295.38
literally dwelling people that

3292.44 --> 3297.78
barely can hold on to knowing what's

3295.38 --> 3300.599
going on like even in their direct

3297.78 --> 3302.579
surroundings that's what we're gonna see

3300.599 --> 3304.38
and people are gonna call it a zombie

3302.579 --> 3306.7200000000003
apocalypse

3304.38 --> 3309.359
but it only works if enough people

3306.72 --> 3312.5989999999997
actually are stupid enough to get it

3309.359 --> 3316.7599999999998
and I don't know how many will be

3312.599 --> 3316.76
getting it I don't know exactly

3316.92 --> 3323.099
I just know that statistically in Europe

3319.859 --> 3327.319
over 4 000 people have died as a direct

3323.099 --> 3327.319
result of taking the vaccine so far

3330.78 --> 3335.1800000000003
but that's just the short-term result

3345.599 --> 3350.2200000000003
huh my classical homeopath and not just

3348.42 --> 3352.5
all virus all acute diseases are the

3350.22 --> 3354.0
body's way of regaining about right well

3352.5 --> 3355.859
this is also what German new medicine

3354.0 --> 3359.22
teaches is that

3355.859 --> 3360.359
when you get symptoms that's usually a

3359.22 --> 3362.3999999999996
sign

3360.359 --> 3366.5989999999997
that it's getting tackled that is

3362.4 --> 3369.599
getting addressed so that's like after

3366.599 --> 3372.1800000000003
Ward as soon as you really start to get

3369.599 --> 3375.119
the symptoms that's your body

3372.18 --> 3377.339
getting together with a unified plan to

3375.119 --> 3379.6800000000003
deal with it

3377.339 --> 3383.819
and that's when you get sickness

3379.68 --> 3387.799
symptoms with most things

3383.819 --> 3387.799
unless it's just acute poisoning

3392.579 --> 3398.4
but yeah look at this point I'm not

3395.4 --> 3402.599
going to tell people like

3398.4 --> 3404.2200000000003
don't trust classic vaccination

3402.599 --> 3406.26
I don't really

3404.22 --> 3409.3799999999997
think I need it

3406.26 --> 3412.559
right but if there's people out there

3409.38 --> 3415.26
that are like no no we want the vaccine

3412.559 --> 3418.38
possibility then I'm like oh yeah sure

3415.26 --> 3419.5200000000004
sure I get it I get it

3418.38 --> 3421.44
so

3419.52 --> 3422.819
if this is really important to you

3421.44 --> 3426.0
realize that

3422.819 --> 3428.2799999999997
the corona vaccines aren't vaccines

3426.0 --> 3430.619
they're not really

3428.28 --> 3433.3190000000004
vaccines in the traditional sense this

3430.619 --> 3435.54
is a genetic engineering based

3433.319 --> 3438.42
experiment

3435.54 --> 3443.599
to tackle a condition

3438.42 --> 3443.599
that's not really an infectious disease

3443.7 --> 3449.5989999999997
like

3444.92 --> 3449.599
bacterial diseases are infectious

3450.839 --> 3456.44
so

3452.52 --> 3456.44
right just don't take it

3456.54 --> 3462.359
and then after it's all over whatever is

3458.94 --> 3465.78
left of humanity we can deal with the

3462.359 --> 3469.2599999999998
medical system and and yeah decide after

3465.78 --> 3473.4
that like do we even still need facts

3469.26 --> 3477.0
are there still any facts Believers left

3473.4 --> 3480.359
to basically demand regular vaccines to

3477.0 --> 3482.7
be utilized in society anymore we'll see

3480.359 --> 3486.0589999999997
after that it could be that this

3482.7 --> 3488.7
vaccination scam is just gonna have so

3486.059 --> 3492.6600000000003
much impact that people are going to be

3488.7 --> 3495.8999999999996
[ __ ] vaccines forever we've just been

3492.66 --> 3498.1189999999997
genocided with vaccines we're never ever

3495.9 --> 3500.579
going to take any we're never going to

3498.119 --> 3502.98
allow any form of vaccine to ever be

3500.579 --> 3505.799
used again it's just going to be

3502.98 --> 3508.319
considered a weapon and just like you're

3505.799 --> 3510.42
not allowed to commit suicide

3508.319 --> 3511.44
you might not be allowed to take a

3510.42 --> 3514.44
vaccine

3511.44 --> 3517.68
right that could be the result of all

3514.44 --> 3521.04
this it could be not saying it will but

3517.68 --> 3523.2599999999998
yeah that's how the swing of opinions

3521.04 --> 3526.38
tend to happen

3523.26 --> 3528.8390000000004
in the face of extreme

3526.38 --> 3530.7000000000003
situations like these

3528.839 --> 3533.4
when it's just being forced on people

3530.7 --> 3535.74
and then they just fall victim to it on

3533.4 --> 3536.76
mass and it's just getting a lot of

3535.74 --> 3540.24
attention

3536.76 --> 3543.119
then yeah the backs lash of it might be

3540.24 --> 3545.339
that just gonna be a world consensus

3543.119 --> 3547.92
like yeah no more vaccines [ __ ] that

3545.339 --> 3549.119
technology we don't need it anymore it's

3547.92 --> 3551.28
outdated

3549.119 --> 3553.92
it's a scam

3551.28 --> 3557.88
it could be it's my personal attitude

3553.92 --> 3559.2000000000003
I'm just not gonna try to force that on

3557.88 --> 3561.059
other people

3559.2 --> 3564.5989999999997
I don't want to

3561.059 --> 3567.5400000000004
somebody believes that taking that is

3564.599 --> 3570.48
good for some reason fine I'm not gonna

3567.54 --> 3572.099
stop you just make sure it's actually a

3570.48 --> 3575.9
vaccine

3572.099 --> 3575.9
that's it that's all

3592.859 --> 3595.4
right

3595.44 --> 3599.96
well clasio classical homeopath

3600.9 --> 3604.559
that's why they want to suppress all

3602.339 --> 3606.7799999999997
acute disease because it will result in

3604.559 --> 3609.1800000000003
more con chronic degeneration yeah I

3606.78 --> 3611.28
agree with that

3609.18 --> 3614.3999999999996
well that's it at least the the

3611.28 --> 3618.059
Psychopaths the corporate industrial

3614.4 --> 3622.079
medical complex people

3618.059 --> 3625.1400000000003
yes that I'm I'm no doubt that is part

3622.079 --> 3629.04
of their long-term plan

3625.14 --> 3631.64
to have more people to feed on

3629.04 --> 3635.599
like that because of a broken down

3631.64 --> 3635.5989999999997
chronic degeneration

3636.18 --> 3640.2799999999997
broken down uh immune system

3645.359 --> 3649.859
so yeah you consider that the medical

3647.76 --> 3652.44
industrial complex has just grown really

3649.859 --> 3654.359
out of control and it's now realizing

3652.44 --> 3656.88
it's out of control for some time

3654.359 --> 3659.0989999999997
knowing that people are eventually going

3656.88 --> 3660.6600000000003
to figure it out so it's literally

3659.099 --> 3663.48
conspired

3660.66 --> 3666.0589999999997
with with banks politics and

3663.48 --> 3670.38
corporations

3666.059 --> 3674.2200000000003
to attack people in order to guarantee

3670.38 --> 3676.7000000000003
Financial income through dependency on

3674.22 --> 3676.7
the long run

3678.72 --> 3680.8999999999996
foreign

3686.96 --> 3692.88
The Brute

3689.94 --> 3696.5
The Brute has stood up and is now

3692.88 --> 3696.5
creating victim slaves

3697.319 --> 3702.72
that's what it's doing

3700.26 --> 3704.48
because it's the only way it can foresee

3702.72 --> 3708.3799999999997
its

3704.48 --> 3708.38
continuation of existence

3717.359 --> 3720.02
right

3732.72 --> 3735.74
all right ah

3735.9 --> 3739.339
yeah I'll be back in two minutes

3743.16 --> 3746.0
foreign

3836.4 --> 3839.4
foreign

3860.6 --> 3863.679
[Applause]

3869.0 --> 3876.119
good to see you ask and receive

3873.119 --> 3876.119
PJ

3877.44 --> 3882.14
yeah Andrew nobody's messing with my

3879.96 --> 3882.14
stuff

3886.2 --> 3893.96
anybody here what happened to Whitsett

3889.339 --> 3893.96
I vaguely heard some rumors

3895.14 --> 3899.8799999999997
like I think he got arrested for drug

3897.599 --> 3902.2200000000003
possession or something I think it's

3899.88 --> 3905.299
just probably cannabis

3902.22 --> 3905.299
so I don't know

3905.52 --> 3908.9
but I heard something

3925.46 --> 3928.51
[Music]

3934.26 --> 3938.8190000000004
oh yeah Cameron kamegasti Gilmore I

3936.599 --> 3940.5
don't know if that's true I haven't

3938.819 --> 3942.72
really checked up I haven't seen

3940.5 --> 3944.88
anything from Whitsett in a while too so

3942.72 --> 3946.5589999999997
who knows it's true I don't know I don't

3944.88 --> 3949.6800000000003
know the circumstances I haven't heard

3946.559 --> 3952.2000000000003
anybody actually talking about it

3949.68 --> 3957.319
that know anything beyond rumors

3952.2 --> 3957.319
so I don't know but I heard that yeah

3960.72 --> 3966.48
right and it's not funny though guys

3963.059 --> 3970.26
like it's not like getting arrested for

3966.48 --> 3973.099
weed is just that doesn't is stupid I

3970.26 --> 3973.099
really think it's stupid

3983.46 --> 3988.26
20 grand well 20 grams is quite a lot

3986.28 --> 3990.2400000000002
though like in the Netherlands you're

3988.26 --> 3991.38
not allowed to have that much on on

3990.24 --> 3994.7599999999998
yourself

3991.38 --> 3994.76
that's a pretty big bag

3997.38 --> 4001.2400000000002
but it's still ridiculous though

4012.5 --> 4018.22
what what is Nathan Thompson got to do

4015.02 --> 4018.22
with that seeking star water

4024.26 --> 4026.7400000000002
oh

4039.02 --> 4044.66
all right Andrew yeah getting caught

4041.539 --> 4047.6800000000003
with dandelions how dare you it is

4044.66 --> 4047.68
ridiculous I agree

4060.02 --> 4064.94
foreign

4061.66 --> 4067.339
should not be regulated well at least it

4064.94 --> 4070.0
should not be a criminal offense like

4067.339 --> 4070.0
that you know

4070.339 --> 4077.96
like I get it if you're gonna it's

4073.7 --> 4080.4399999999996
complicated it's just really complicated

4077.96 --> 4084.7
I think technically it should just be

4080.44 --> 4084.7000000000003
legalized everywhere but

4087.44 --> 4093.88
in the condition the world is in I don't

4089.839 --> 4093.88
really see that happening anytime soon

4096.02 --> 4100.2390000000005
the 30k bondage

4100.339 --> 4103.48
that's crazy

4119.42 --> 4122.38
right anyway

4127.699 --> 4132.8589999999995
and I don't know

4129.859 --> 4132.859
foreign

4169.839 --> 4175.299
ER I heard that too in some states it's

4173.299 --> 4178.819
just completely legalized and even

4175.299 --> 4181.04
industrialized like Colorado

4178.819 --> 4184.06
and then other states it's still

4181.04 --> 4184.06
completely illegal

4203.84 --> 4210.219
right yeah yeah that that true that that

4207.26 --> 4210.219
too iron Fe

4211.82 --> 4217.04
yeah because

4213.38 --> 4219.02
cannabis is not just the weed for the

4217.04 --> 4222.26
smoking and getting high

4219.02 --> 4226.040000000001
or even the CBD oil extract it's also

4222.26 --> 4228.26
indeed usable to

4226.04 --> 4230.12
to grow those plants another type of

4228.26 --> 4232.6990000000005
plants for the fibers

4230.12 --> 4234.14
for attack for industry

4232.699 --> 4237.678999999999
and

4234.14 --> 4241.96
like it would work very good for that so

4237.679 --> 4246.02
they also with they basically

4241.96 --> 4247.58
started the war on drugs that included

4246.02 --> 4250.719
cannabis

4247.58 --> 4253.4
specifically also to completely just

4250.719 --> 4258.08
ruin and Poison the Well for that

4253.4 --> 4260.48
industry to create Superstition and just

4258.08 --> 4265.239
uh

4260.48 --> 4265.239
call it again and stigmatize it

4267.92 --> 4271.0
I agree with that

4276.27 --> 4279.409000000001
[Music]

4283.1 --> 4285.58
hmm

4292.46 --> 4298.52
acre of hemp is equal to 10 acres of

4294.92 --> 4303.58
trees is it in what sense

4298.52 --> 4303.580000000001
you mean in the CO2 absorption

4305.239 --> 4309.62
could be

4307.46 --> 4311.78
and that is just very ironic in

4309.62 --> 4315.199
retrospect then

4311.78 --> 4318.139999999999
right so the climate change carbon

4315.199 --> 4320.719
credit nonsense happening being rolled

4318.14 --> 4324.679
out through globalism on the world but

4320.719 --> 4328.28
yet hemp bad because ham oh yeah

4324.679 --> 4331.88
somebody made a Nutty video one time

4328.28 --> 4334.759999999999
about how you go all crazy smoking it so

4331.88 --> 4337.219
now this plant which is like a perfect

4334.76 --> 4338.719
solution to the virtual problem of

4337.219 --> 4341.36
climate change and the carpet credit

4338.719 --> 4342.9800000000005
system yeah that's not not really

4341.36 --> 4346.659
allowed anymore

4342.98 --> 4346.659
it is quite ridiculous

4359.56 --> 4364.88
or dictator in China

4362.5 --> 4368.32
immediately yeah it's supposed to be

4364.88 --> 4368.32
illegal right

4369.4 --> 4373.0
but that's just fine

4381.5 --> 4387.34
is it good for biodiesel really well I'm

4389.48 --> 4395.08
I'm not that much of a proponent for

4392.239 --> 4395.08
biodiesel

4395.6 --> 4398.92
you know I think it's

4399.08 --> 4405.32
it's not necessary

4402.26 --> 4406.64
like as an extra thing to have around

4405.32 --> 4409.699
sure

4406.64 --> 4412.04
why not but it like

4409.699 --> 4414.5599999999995
I think just things like coal and

4412.04 --> 4417.5
regular oil

4414.56 --> 4420.679
like it's not gonna replace it people

4417.5 --> 4424.06
it's not it's not gonna replace it that

4420.679 --> 4424.06
would be a bad idea

4424.1 --> 4428.7390000000005
oh hello Julia pavin

4431.719 --> 4435.76
okay I'll check PayPal what is this

4439.64 --> 4442.780000000001
this is quite typical

4445.34 --> 4451.3
wow thank you thank you very much

4448.82 --> 4451.299999999999
man

4452.12 --> 4457.82
you guys really do know how to pile it

4454.58 --> 4459.98
on all at once every time

4457.82 --> 4461.719
so I'm waiting for like weeks and it's

4459.98 --> 4465.08
like oh damn it's been so long and then

4461.719 --> 4467.36
suddenly it comes dropping in but yeah

4465.08 --> 4469.04
thank you very much

4467.36 --> 4471.62
that is

4469.04 --> 4475.0
extremely helpful

4471.62 --> 4475.0
thank you very much

4477.56 --> 4480.04
hmm

4482.12 --> 4488.719
huh

4484.34 --> 4490.219
right well it's 20 down so it's like at

4488.719 --> 4491.96
50 now

4490.219 --> 4494.78
it's crazy

4491.96 --> 4497.6
why is that working so well well it must

4494.78 --> 4500.48
be because just

4497.6 --> 4504.159000000001
worries about money is just that

4500.48 --> 4504.159
stressful to me I think

4505.58 --> 4511.5199999999995
it is like I used to call it Financial

4509.36 --> 4515.62
phobia

4511.52 --> 4520.580000000001
because I just have excessive responses

4515.62 --> 4524.12
to the fear of the lack of money or

4520.58 --> 4527.0
debt all that like I have a like almost

4524.12 --> 4528.199
like a spiritual allergic responses to

4527.0 --> 4530.9
this

4528.199 --> 4532.82
and it is stressful but yeah this is

4530.9 --> 4534.92
helping a lot thank you so much Julio

4532.82 --> 4538.719
cabin and thank you earlier seeking star

4534.92 --> 4538.719
water for your contribution as well

4540.8 --> 4544.76
of course money worries are stressful

4542.78 --> 4546.86
yes they are

4544.76 --> 4548.0
thank you so much for helping me out

4546.86 --> 4550.4
with that

4548.0 --> 4553.78
are against it

4550.4 --> 4553.78
I really appreciate that

4557.6 --> 4566.02
um the van is made of weed fiber weed

4563.179 --> 4566.02
that's funny

4567.38 --> 4572.84
could it be done like instead of just

4570.62 --> 4576.58
like fiberglass

4572.84 --> 4576.58
using hemp fiber

4578.3 --> 4583.2390000000005
does that work I never even thought

4580.76 --> 4583.2390000000005
about that

4592.699 --> 4596.78
and bio

4594.5 --> 4599.0
isn't self-sufficient look at the waste

4596.78 --> 4602.62
from food industry

4599.0 --> 4602.62
right well you know what

4607.1 --> 4615.56
could that be done could like food

4610.78 --> 4618.98
industry waste actually be used

4615.56 --> 4621.38
to convert to biofuel because if that

4618.98 --> 4625.04
shit's just gonna be thrown out and left

4621.38 --> 4627.32
a rot then maybe food waste could

4625.04 --> 4629.0
actually almost like a recycling thing

4627.32 --> 4632.54
be collected

4629.0 --> 4635.06
and then turned into biofuel instead

4632.54 --> 4637.94
if it's gonna just rot away

4635.06 --> 4639.620000000001
or maybe used for compost or maybe turn

4637.94 --> 4641.48
into biofuel

4639.62 --> 4643.699
now at some point the pointer is just

4641.48 --> 4647.5
going to be too much compost

4643.699 --> 4647.5
and yeah food industry

4647.719 --> 4652.159
it's not all that

4649.88 --> 4655.219
good for the ground anyway you know it's

4652.159 --> 4657.08
the garbage put in there but for biofuel

4655.219 --> 4660.38
it would matter less

4657.08 --> 4662.719
if there is some polluted element to it

4660.38 --> 4665.179
because yeah it's not going to be for

4662.719 --> 4668.0
plants to grow off that if it's just

4665.179 --> 4671.36
going to be converted to biofuel

4668.0 --> 4675.14
that would actually work great if

4671.36 --> 4678.08
if the logistics for such a setup could

4675.14 --> 4681.38
work because yeah food and especially

4678.08 --> 4685.219
food remnants take up space

4681.38 --> 4688.82
right so Logistics will probably be

4685.219 --> 4691.0
the Crux of the situation to make it

4688.82 --> 4691.0
work

4716.0 --> 4719.739
but yeah when you think about that you

4718.28 --> 4722.42
could even

4719.739 --> 4724.459999999999
consider bringing it up to the point

4722.42 --> 4728.62
where even just like

4724.46 --> 4732.14
sewer stuff could potentially be

4728.62 --> 4733.88
converted to fuel

4732.14 --> 4737.06
all that crap

4733.88 --> 4739.159000000001
and garbage food garbage a lot that

4737.06 --> 4742.820000000001
people throw away

4739.159 --> 4744.86
and the toilet paper all of those things

4742.82 --> 4749.599999999999
contain

4744.86 --> 4752.36
well feel like substances so maybe maybe

4749.6 --> 4754.280000000001
on the very very long run some system

4752.36 --> 4757.719
could even be a device to literally get

4754.28 --> 4757.719
biofuel out of

4758.06 --> 4762.92
yeah out of just sewer waste

4761.0 --> 4764.84
but that might be a little bit of a

4762.92 --> 4767.179
stretch I just kind of popped into my

4764.84 --> 4768.7390000000005
head just now like it could potentially

4767.179 --> 4770.719
be used for that

4768.739 --> 4773.178999999999
but then again yeah what would come out

4770.719 --> 4774.8
of it would it not be extremely polluted

4773.179 --> 4778.1
it's difficult

4774.8 --> 4780.8
it might not be worth it in the end

4778.1 --> 4784.52
and also yeah you're going to have to

4780.8 --> 4787.28
deal with a constant influx of new type

4784.52 --> 4789.620000000001
of substances being dumped into it

4787.28 --> 4792.62
just through new food through new

4789.62 --> 4794.96
medications all that stuff it's going to

4792.62 --> 4799.219
be a constant shift to deal with how to

4794.96 --> 4801.92
get rid of the dangerous pollutants

4799.219 --> 4805.0
in order for the biofuel not to become

4801.92 --> 4805.0
extremely toxic

4827.659 --> 4832.04
all right yeah Julio Kevin thank you by

4830.239 --> 4836.5
the way I really appreciate it I know

4832.04 --> 4836.5
you've you've supported me for years now

4837.38 --> 4843.58
and you really helped me stay afloat so

4840.26 --> 4843.58
I thank you a lot for that

4874.4 --> 4880.339999999999
right yeah seeking style water like

4877.639 --> 4882.679
there's been a whole lot of attention to

4880.34 --> 4885.139
all kinds of recycling

4882.679 --> 4887.06
since the 90s especially I took note of

4885.139 --> 4889.159000000001
maybe it's just because I Grew Older and

4887.06 --> 4892.84
started to get interested but recycling

4889.159 --> 4892.839999999999
has always caught my attention

4894.199 --> 4899.659
and yeah there has been a lot of

4897.8 --> 4901.76
development in it especially in the

4899.659 --> 4903.739
Netherlands it was always a high

4901.76 --> 4906.4400000000005
interest

4903.739 --> 4908.659
because of well because we want to be

4906.44 --> 4911.36
environmentally friendly like even

4908.659 --> 4912.799999999999
before the the carbon credit nonsense

4911.36 --> 4915.739
came out

4912.8 --> 4917.4800000000005
we're generally interested in recycling

4915.739 --> 4920.718999999999
and things

4917.48 --> 4924.0199999999995
but yeah now with the crisis situation

4920.719 --> 4927.02
and everything going on out there

4924.02 --> 4928.88
there's just less

4927.02 --> 4931.34
room

4928.88 --> 4932.54
to consider it

4931.34 --> 4935.179
it's just

4932.54 --> 4938.179
you know recycling is in a way it

4935.179 --> 4939.7390000000005
requires a certain level of stability in

4938.179 --> 4941.3
order to achieve that

4939.739 --> 4944.419999999999
because

4941.3 --> 4945.92
there has to be effort put into it to to

4944.42 --> 4948.7390000000005
keep it going

4945.92 --> 4952.1
you have to have that maneuvering room

4948.739 --> 4953.839999999999
within Society to achieve that or it's

4952.1 --> 4956.8
just gonna Heap up and then nothing's

4953.84 --> 4956.8
gonna be recycled

4965.9 --> 4972.259999999999
right oh yeah I heard about that

4969.219 --> 4975.139
incinerators like burning trash and then

4972.26 --> 4981.1
using the ashes as filler in

4975.139 --> 4986.36
in the building sector also as like uh

4981.1 --> 4988.34
foundational foundations for roads

4986.36 --> 4992.36
like I heard that they did that they'd

4988.34 --> 4995.7390000000005
just take the ashes put them in big bags

4992.36 --> 4995.739
and then use them

4996.56 --> 5004.54
as filler for like a bridge typical Road

5001.179 --> 5004.54
Bridge constructions

5005.62 --> 5010.239
that's how they use it a lot in the

5007.96 --> 5013.12
Netherlands

5010.239 --> 5016.299999999999
and there are some downsides to that too

5013.12 --> 5019.48
because those ashes within the within

5016.3 --> 5022.4800000000005
the bags they are still toxic

5019.48 --> 5025.659
so if they were to rupture and

5022.48 --> 5029.138999999999
everything it will contribute to

5025.659 --> 5030.28
the pollution of the ground in that

5029.139 --> 5034.3
location

5030.28 --> 5037.679
so it's it's literally a mixed bag

5034.3 --> 5037.679
it's a little complicated

5043.9 --> 5048.78
oh Sean Hawkins playing with his dolls

5046.659 --> 5048.78
again

5062.62 --> 5067.36
yeah but I understand when you got

5065.08 --> 5069.159
nothing you don't have to faculties you

5067.36 --> 5071.44
don't have the

5069.159 --> 5076.08
social skills

5071.44 --> 5076.08
the time left in your life

5076.48 --> 5081.04
and the intellect yeah you're gonna then

5079.239 --> 5083.98
get really frustrated with people like

5081.04 --> 5085.719
Nathan and kiwi that are quite merciless

5083.98 --> 5088.659
and then now of course you're gonna

5085.719 --> 5092.44
basically make virtual dolls out of them

5088.659 --> 5094.54
and then imagine how you can defeat them

5092.44 --> 5097.659
to give yourself some peace and quiet

5094.54 --> 5101.46
inside I know it's it's very logical of

5097.659 --> 5101.46
you Sean Hawkins to do that

5101.679 --> 5107.88
just so you know in reality you're not

5104.8 --> 5107.88
demolishing anything

5110.1 --> 5117.219
prove they are wrong about Einstein's

5112.84 --> 5120.6990000000005
superseding Newton oh my God

5117.219 --> 5123.699
really you proved that

5120.699 --> 5123.699
really

5126.46 --> 5131.5
and how did you prove that did you prove

5128.679 --> 5133.78
that by saying you proved that

5131.5 --> 5136.719
and not following up on it not have an

5133.78 --> 5138.58
actual presentation and referenceable

5136.719 --> 5140.679
data

5138.58 --> 5142.239
you're just saying it spreading it as

5140.679 --> 5144.46
rumor and then hoping that people

5142.239 --> 5146.678999999999
actually buy into it out of sheer

5144.46 --> 5148.9800000000005
boredom is that what you think Sean

5146.679 --> 5148.9800000000005
Hawkins

5156.94 --> 5160.259999999999
they're on citations

5160.36 --> 5164.219
oh really and how are you gonna do that

5166.06 --> 5172.179
really so

5169.12 --> 5176.0199999999995
how are you gonna use Newton's citations

5172.179 --> 5177.04
to prove that Einstein did not supersede

5176.02 --> 5179.9800000000005
him

5177.04 --> 5182.08
and then how are you gonna use which

5179.98 --> 5186.48
Einstein

5182.08 --> 5186.48
citations are you going to use

5187.179 --> 5191.8
that there aren't any that where

5189.58 --> 5195.42
Einstein basically said no no Newton

5191.8 --> 5195.42
mechanics definitely work

5195.58 --> 5201.76
they were I don't think Einstein ever

5198.219 --> 5204.46
even really addressed Newton's mechanics

5201.76 --> 5207.06
I don't think he ever even did that he

5204.46 --> 5210.34
literally just conjured his own

5207.06 --> 5214.9800000000005
conceptual medium and then wandered off

5210.34 --> 5214.9800000000005
into that not really addressing Newton

5222.28 --> 5228.099999999999
check out the videos on my Channel

5224.56 --> 5230.860000000001
videos you have a video really is it so

5228.1 --> 5233.639
your videos as in Sean Hawkins

5230.86 --> 5233.639
blabbering

5235.9 --> 5238.62
okay

5239.199 --> 5242.04
okay

5242.5 --> 5247.36
I think I'll bring that up then

5245.08 --> 5249.659
on the Flat Earth debates that you said

5247.36 --> 5249.659
that

5251.38 --> 5255.179
so that the guys can have a good laugh

5259.48 --> 5264.5199999999995
all right

5261.76 --> 5268.0
well Sean Hawkins your your gas lighting

5264.52 --> 5270.84
is not working I'm sorry I'm immune to

5268.0 --> 5270.84
ball [ __ ]

5280.42 --> 5282.6
foreign

5285.4 --> 5290.62
yeah I haven't seen you in a while

5288.28 --> 5293.46
yeah things are all right in my world

5290.62 --> 5293.46
I'm having

5295.36 --> 5302.159
well it's not perfect

5297.699 --> 5302.159
but I'm still I'm still keeping going

5303.159 --> 5306.42
still keep going

5336.76 --> 5341.38
what flat on the pulse I

5339.94 --> 5344.638999999999
what

5341.38 --> 5344.639
are you saying

5373.42 --> 5378.88
yeah well flat on the pearls why don't

5375.699 --> 5381.219
you just try to rewrite your sentence

5378.88 --> 5383.139
and then just get it right the first

5381.219 --> 5385.0
time how about that

5383.139 --> 5387.54
because I'm not making any sense of what

5385.0 --> 5387.54
you just said

5413.02 --> 5418.8
okay well if you're not gonna rewrite it

5415.06 --> 5418.8
then I'm not gonna read it

5446.58 --> 5452.679
oh okay yeah I didn't see that he was

5450.1 --> 5454.780000000001
gossiping about Whitsett was he he

5452.679 --> 5457.6
didn't use the name in there so I didn't

5454.78 --> 5460.739
see that and the sentence was kind of

5457.6 --> 5460.7390000000005
written sloppily so

5461.02 --> 5468.4800000000005
yeah I don't really care for as to how

5464.679 --> 5468.4800000000005
we got to that scenario you know

5473.32 --> 5481.42
no Sean Hawkins he didn't you're a liar

5477.58 --> 5483.699
you're a liar you're not blocked

5481.42 --> 5486.6990000000005
he would never block you on his channel

5483.699 --> 5488.5599999999995
because you're too [ __ ] funny to

5486.699 --> 5493.799999999999
block

5488.56 --> 5493.8
right it's too amusing to block you

5494.02 --> 5500.139
so down don't bring that nonsense um

5498.28 --> 5501.4
being blocked it's all [ __ ] you're

5500.139 --> 5506.1
not blocked

5501.4 --> 5506.099999999999
you're too funny to block okay

5518.44 --> 5523.299999999999
unless he blocked you at some point in

5520.96 --> 5526.0
chat when I wasn't there

5523.3 --> 5528.96
but I don't think so I don't see why

5526.0 --> 5528.96
Nathan would do that

5529.179 --> 5535.78
like Nathan will block nasty sock trolls

5533.4 --> 5539.0199999999995
spamming and [ __ ] and getting all nasty

5535.78 --> 5541.659
but you are an actual person that's or

5539.02 --> 5544.719
at least had the balls to get on camera

5541.659 --> 5547.599999999999
and identify themselves for real

5544.719 --> 5549.159
that deserves some respect for whatever

5547.6 --> 5553.54
it's worth

5549.159 --> 5556.239
and then why would they block you

5553.54 --> 5557.139
right because we know exactly who you

5556.239 --> 5560.86
are

5557.139 --> 5563.56
and everything you do is going to be

5560.86 --> 5565.9
part of you so why would we want to

5563.56 --> 5567.639
prevent you from making an ass of

5565.9 --> 5569.86
yourself which you do pretty much with

5567.639 --> 5572.400000000001
every time you appear

5569.86 --> 5572.4
you know

5596.06 --> 5599.1990000000005
[Music]

5605.15 --> 5608.86
[Music]

5616.78 --> 5619.08
foreign

5624.179 --> 5630.84
Hawkins if you really have this proof

5627.76 --> 5638.219
where Einstein said no

5630.84 --> 5640.84
my gravity does not replace or supersede

5638.219 --> 5645.52
Newton's gravity

5640.84 --> 5648.219
then could you perhaps verbaten quote it

5645.52 --> 5651.219
you know you're on a computer you could

5648.219 --> 5652.2390000000005
literally type it in Brackets or like

5651.219 --> 5654.94
yeah

5652.239 --> 5656.799999999999
so you know this is a quote if you got

5654.94 --> 5660.4
that evidence you should be able to

5656.8 --> 5663.28
literally copy that in a 200 character

5660.4 --> 5665.92
message easily you know you don't

5663.28 --> 5669.46
if you just put the summary in it

5665.92 --> 5672.6990000000005
maybe on top of that a reference as to

5669.46 --> 5676.2390000000005
where and when he said that in what

5672.699 --> 5678.339999999999
publication or what letter letter that

5676.239 --> 5680.678999999999
would be great

5678.34 --> 5683.02
you know I'm not gonna watch your

5680.679 --> 5686.5
freaking video though you're going to

5683.02 --> 5689.02
just have to quote him with that if you

5686.5 --> 5692.159
really have this evidence that you're so

5689.02 --> 5692.159000000001
assured off

5711.88 --> 5716.86
and we should first no no it's not about

5714.58 --> 5720.76
that

5716.86 --> 5722.799999999999
charge Sanford in this case it's about

5720.76 --> 5724.719
Sean Hawkins just

5722.8 --> 5726.88
basically

5724.719 --> 5729.34
try to Bluff because I'm pretty sure

5726.88 --> 5731.619
it's a bluff Bluff that Einstein's

5729.34 --> 5733.96
gravity never superseded Newton even

5731.619 --> 5736.36
though that is officially accepted then

5733.96 --> 5738.04
many people have

5736.36 --> 5740.44
basically

5738.04 --> 5743.219
put that down on writing throughout the

5740.44 --> 5743.219
last hundred years

5743.38 --> 5751.36
but if he says that Einstein actually

5748.44 --> 5754.9
himself said no no no it doesn't

5751.36 --> 5756.339999999999
Newton's gravity is still in effect

5754.9 --> 5761.4
literally

5756.34 --> 5761.400000000001
then I would like to see that quote

5763.96 --> 5768.0
so this is about what was said

5776.199 --> 5781.119
but it seems like Sean Hawkins just just

5779.26 --> 5783.219
gone away again

5781.119 --> 5785.199
so it was just probably complete

5783.219 --> 5788.639
[ __ ] and he just made it up on the

5785.199 --> 5788.638999999999
spot to try and Gaslight us

5792.219 --> 5796.84
or as I said at the start he's just

5794.679 --> 5800.02
playing with his dolls again

5796.84 --> 5801.9400000000005
right and that's Spaceballs reference by

5800.02 --> 5805.3
the way

5801.94 --> 5806.799999999999
right remember that scene in Spaceballs

5805.3 --> 5810.28
Darth helmet

5806.8 --> 5813.28
Darth helmet playing with his opponent

5810.28 --> 5815.92
characters right

5813.28 --> 5817.179
isn't that exactly what Sean Hawkins is

5815.92 --> 5820.9
doing

5817.179 --> 5822.88
QE Nathan oh playing with his dolls

5820.9 --> 5825.04
again

5822.88 --> 5829.08
right

5825.04 --> 5829.08
I thought it was a great comparison

5850.78 --> 5853.44
right

5873.82 --> 5880.44
no no quote and there's the daylight

5877.42 --> 5880.4400000000005
again boom

5891.45 --> 5894.5199999999995
[Music]

5895.9 --> 5898.08
foreign

5899.58 --> 5903.3
Hawkins has moved on

5928.0 --> 5935.4
all right so let us also move on I got

5931.0 --> 5935.4
still I got 25 more minutes for the show

5935.5 --> 5937.679
foreign

5944.76 --> 5951.639
talking about Recycling and

5948.48 --> 5953.5
biofuel How Could You extract it through

5951.639 --> 5955.96
cannabis

5953.5 --> 5959.199
through food

5955.96 --> 5961.36
waste recycling

5959.199 --> 5963.46
like especially with restaurants and all

5961.36 --> 5965.38
that and supermarkets they have a lot of

5963.46 --> 5968.44
food waste you know some of it is

5965.38 --> 5970.84
basically forwarded to Farms like

5968.44 --> 5973.599999999999
people's horses and stuff

5970.84 --> 5976.0
but yeah still a lot is wasted and

5973.6 --> 5978.639
especially the lower quality that's not

5976.0 --> 5980.619
that nutritious like it is just wasted

5978.639 --> 5982.84
you know

5980.619 --> 5985.0
nobody wants to feed that garbage to

5982.84 --> 5988.360000000001
their animals

5985.0 --> 5991.6
so why could it not be

5988.36 --> 5994.48
why couldn't it be devised a system

5991.6 --> 5997.3
where just all the food waste

5994.48 --> 6000.0
specifically could be collected and just

5997.3 --> 6002.639
quickly turn into biofuel pretty much no

6000.0 --> 6005.9
matter the quality of the food it

6002.639 --> 6005.900000000001
wouldn't have to matter as much

6006.36 --> 6012.78
you know so you can get rid of the the

6009.32 --> 6015.179
majority of crappy food being wasted not

6012.78 --> 6017.099999999999
just the organic food because I'm all

6015.179 --> 6020.46
for

6017.1 --> 6023.46
turning organic food waste into compost

6020.46 --> 6026.1
that is the best thing ever it's like

6023.46 --> 6028.9800000000005
everybody should do that but yeah with

6026.1 --> 6031.9800000000005
the the regular crappy food

6028.98 --> 6034.0199999999995
not so recommendable because yeah it's

6031.98 --> 6036.839999999999
gonna basically get into the ground

6034.02 --> 6038.400000000001
influence it influence the plants it's

6036.84 --> 6040.4400000000005
not as good

6038.4 --> 6042.659
but it's still a waste if it would

6040.44 --> 6045.9
literally be wasted and just end up on

6042.659 --> 6050.28
the garbage so a biofuel

6045.9 --> 6052.5599999999995
solution for regular food waste not

6050.28 --> 6055.139
organic food waste

6052.56 --> 6058.080000000001
I don't know I don't see that as a bad

6055.139 --> 6060.2390000000005
idea I think that would be viable

6058.08 --> 6063.139
but it would require a pretty stable

6060.239 --> 6063.138999999999
Society though

6073.38 --> 6077.34
right

6074.639 --> 6079.139
I would order it in such a fashion that

6077.34 --> 6080.76
organic

6079.139 --> 6083.219
food waste

6080.76 --> 6087.6
oh well or food that's just outdated and

6083.219 --> 6089.76
all that should be given to well to the

6087.6 --> 6092.6990000000005
homeless to people in need of food the

6089.76 --> 6095.159000000001
poor that still that can get around that

6092.699 --> 6097.86
need food make it organic

6095.159 --> 6100.44
do that at least

6097.86 --> 6102.96
and the rest and especially like the

6100.44 --> 6105.719
remnants like Peels and all that [ __ ]

6102.96 --> 6109.199
try to compost them if it's suitable for

6105.719 --> 6111.119
that and everything else that is food

6109.199 --> 6114.599999999999
waste should be

6111.119 --> 6116.5199999999995
probably or could be turned into biofuel

6114.6 --> 6118.6990000000005
then you at least get something out of

6116.52 --> 6118.6990000000005
it

6123.6 --> 6128.400000000001
no biofuel is quick or efficient I don't

6126.3 --> 6130.679
know George Sanford I'm just putting

6128.4 --> 6134.239
together ideas I already said he had

6130.679 --> 6134.2390000000005
Logistics might be a problem

6139.86 --> 6147.179
but at least you'd get the biofuel out

6143.219 --> 6150.719
of waste instead of like dedicating Farm

6147.179 --> 6154.46
grounds to creating biofuel now that

6150.719 --> 6154.46
seems like a huge waste to me

6162.3 --> 6168.26
done 50 gallon drums with your fryer oil

6165.36 --> 6168.259999999999
right

6169.139 --> 6174.4800000000005
yeah with the oil yeah fry frying oil

6172.139 --> 6176.58
and of course that's that's great for

6174.48 --> 6179.78
biofuel that's like one of the the most

6176.58 --> 6179.78
efficient things for it

6198.08 --> 6203.36
dude George Sanford what are you

6200.639 --> 6203.36
babbling about

6230.34 --> 6235.619000000001
okay iron Fe

6232.44 --> 6238.0199999999995
that's thank you for the quote although

6235.619 --> 6240.36
I don't really understand

6238.02 --> 6243.139
nor do I see what that would have to do

6240.36 --> 6243.139
with gravity

6246.719 --> 6252.4800000000005
and what gravity is and what it's not

6250.08 --> 6256.639
it's you brought up theory of relativity

6252.48 --> 6256.638999999999
but that's not gravity though

6265.94 --> 6271.739
yeah clutch Bear yeah George Sanford is

6269.4 --> 6275.04
a bit of a contrarian I I spotted that

6271.739 --> 6277.919999999999
too yeah he has been for some time

6275.04 --> 6280.739
that's also why he hasn't a wrench

6277.92 --> 6283.32
even though he's been um in my chat for

6280.739 --> 6286.04
quite some time at least a year well

6283.32 --> 6286.04
probably more

6287.76 --> 6294.1990000000005
a realist now a contrarian is not a

6290.219 --> 6294.199
realist a contrarian is a contrarian

6302.159 --> 6311.4
right and nobody suggested that the

6306.5 --> 6315.78
biofuel gained from my recycling idea

6311.4 --> 6318.179
was going to be some giant reservoir of

6315.78 --> 6320.099999999999
fuel no

6318.179 --> 6322.08
it's recycling

6320.1 --> 6325.5
so it's going to be a little extra it's

6322.08 --> 6328.38
it should never be the main fuel source

6325.5 --> 6330.9
to replace all others I I'm totally

6328.38 --> 6332.34
against that totally

6330.9 --> 6335.119
it's ridiculous

6332.34 --> 6335.119000000001
to do that

6336.36 --> 6340.199
doesn't mean that it shouldn't be used

6338.82 --> 6342.84
at all

6340.199 --> 6346.199
it's just that this

6342.84 --> 6348.96
he had Neo environmentalist idea of oh

6346.199 --> 6352.799999999999
we gotta get rid of all the

6348.96 --> 6355.26
all the oil and all the coal and so

6352.8 --> 6357.360000000001
biofuel to replace it all that that's

6355.26 --> 6359.159000000001
where it goes wrong

6357.36 --> 6361.0199999999995
that's bad

6359.159 --> 6363.98
because then it's gonna actually cause

6361.02 --> 6363.9800000000005
more waste

6392.219 --> 6400.92
our refineries do use not does use

6398.219 --> 6405.2390000000005
all right it will Refinery one okay it

6400.92 --> 6407.9400000000005
is does our Refinery you have a Refinery

6405.239 --> 6410.48
I didn't know you have a Refinery George

6407.94 --> 6410.48
Sanford

6419.88 --> 6423.900000000001
just bare minimum two-piece government

6421.92 --> 6426.84
okay fine

6423.9 --> 6429.78
well if it's that inefficient then I'm

6426.84 --> 6431.1
I'm very happy to completely discard the

6429.78 --> 6435.179
concept

6431.1 --> 6437.820000000001
I never really liked biofuel at all

6435.179 --> 6439.7390000000005
to me it seems much more logical if

6437.82 --> 6442.739
you're gonna try to conjure some

6439.739 --> 6445.0199999999995
alternative fuel source entirely to just

6442.739 --> 6447.839999999999
go with hydrogen

6445.02 --> 6450.780000000001
or even better water just create the

6447.84 --> 6451.8
hydrogen literally right in front of the

6450.78 --> 6454.619
engine

6451.8 --> 6457.92
and not somewhere in some facility in

6454.619 --> 6462.08
order to store it all in a tank

6457.92 --> 6462.08
just literally created on the spot

6462.719 --> 6467.699
you know

6464.04 --> 6470.1
because biofuel to replace

6467.699 --> 6473.94
gasoline

6470.1 --> 6477.56
from oil and all that that's idiotic

6473.94 --> 6481.138999999999
sorry it is idiotic

6477.56 --> 6482.820000000001
stupidest environmental squirter idea

6481.139 --> 6486.36
ever

6482.82 --> 6487.98
really it is it's very stupid to think

6486.36 --> 6489.42
that that's going to be a solution to

6487.98 --> 6491.4
anything

6489.42 --> 6494.9
especially a solution for the

6491.4 --> 6494.9
environment it's not

6501.42 --> 6506.1
right but yeah if you can make your own

6504.119 --> 6509.099999999999
biofuel that would be cool

6506.1 --> 6511.280000000001
you see in certain setups

6509.1 --> 6514.9800000000005
it's kind of like with

6511.28 --> 6517.139
uh with solar power and wind power if

6514.98 --> 6520.619
you if you say Have a Farm

6517.139 --> 6523.26
having a windmill on like literally on

6520.619 --> 6526.619
the farm right there yeah that could be

6523.26 --> 6528.719
quite handy some solar panels right

6526.619 --> 6531.0
there not at a distance going through a

6528.719 --> 6533.699
wire and all that just right there yeah

6531.0 --> 6535.08
that could be great a great addition and

6533.699 --> 6539.04
hey maybe

6535.08 --> 6542.4
creating your own biofuel from your own

6539.04 --> 6545.04
waste products on the farm like the

6542.4 --> 6548.219
vegetable waste products

6545.04 --> 6550.739
whatever or I don't know fat

6548.219 --> 6552.42
if you're in animal farms

6550.739 --> 6555.598999999999
I don't know

6552.42 --> 6558.179
like yeah then maybe you could use

6555.599 --> 6560.9400000000005
biofuel for your tractors or something

6558.179 --> 6562.679
you know to create it yourself

6560.94 --> 6565.379999999999
to make it even more self-sufficient

6562.679 --> 6567.92
yeah that's actually a great formula in

6565.38 --> 6567.92
my opinion

6568.139 --> 6575.04
but as a standardized societal

6570.9 --> 6579.32
adaptation it's it's the worst don't do

6575.04 --> 6579.32
biofuel standard don't do it

6586.93 --> 6589.9890000000005
[Music]

6591.239 --> 6594.08
wow

6594.84 --> 6600.2390000000005
tempted to make a biofuel plan but not

6598.38 --> 6603.92
enough crops to keep it operating while

6600.239 --> 6603.919999999999
that's that's ridiculous then

6628.679 --> 6634.82
right so that's my opinion on biofuel

6636.599 --> 6642.5
it's a good tool but it shouldn't be

6639.78 --> 6642.5
standardized

6661.98 --> 6667.5
although yeah again maybe for Farms it

6665.099 --> 6670.679
would be great maybe Farmers would be

6667.5 --> 6673.46
like yeah man I got all this vegetable

6670.679 --> 6676.679
waste anyway so why not just make

6673.46 --> 6679.32
biofuel out of it for my tractor and

6676.679 --> 6680.34
then yeah it would be cool if typical I

6679.32 --> 6682.32
guess

6680.34 --> 6684.900000000001
if that is a thing that could really

6682.32 --> 6689.099
work out on the long run than to make

6684.9 --> 6691.86
tractors run on regular Diesel and also

6689.099 --> 6693.599
to make the motor specifically good for

6691.86 --> 6698.119
biofuel as well

6693.599 --> 6698.119000000001
so that they could choose to do that

6700.02 --> 6707.219
right iron Fe I agree

6703.56 --> 6709.26
for Farms it's great because if you have

6707.219 --> 6712.26
Vegetable Farms you're going to usually

6709.26 --> 6714.54
have a lot of green waste so why not use

6712.26 --> 6717.780000000001
it you know

6714.54 --> 6720.119
if you got more green waste then you can

6717.78 --> 6722.639
recycle

6720.119 --> 6725.82
or that you can turn into compost it's

6722.639 --> 6728.6990000000005
just too much for that to it like it

6725.82 --> 6730.799999999999
would effectively pile up

6728.699 --> 6733.32
and just get in the way then why not

6730.8 --> 6735.9800000000005
turn it into biofuel instead that seems

6733.32 --> 6735.98
very sensible

6738.659 --> 6744.299999999999
what kind of modifications do you need

6740.88 --> 6747.119
to do an engine to let it run on biofuel

6744.3 --> 6750.659000000001
I'm not sure I'm not an engineer I'm not

6747.119 --> 6753.119
an engine technician with engines but I

6750.659 --> 6754.44
do know that biofuel is very close to

6753.119 --> 6755.58
diesel

6754.44 --> 6758.159
so

6755.58 --> 6761.76
I think diesel engines can

6758.159 --> 6764.759999999999
be adapted or even just run straight out

6761.76 --> 6767.6990000000005
on biofuel I'm not sure ask a

6764.76 --> 6770.88
a motor engine technician about these

6767.699 --> 6773.699
things I don't know I I'm not a I'm not

6770.88 --> 6776.6990000000005
an engine technician

6773.699 --> 6779.04
but I from what I've heard it's very

6776.699 --> 6782.839999999999
close to diesel

6779.04 --> 6782.84
it requires diesel engines

6798.3 --> 6802.5
right

6799.98 --> 6804.598999999999
so yeah diesel engines is the first

6802.5 --> 6807.44
thing I would think about engaging in

6804.599 --> 6812.34
that and just ask

6807.44 --> 6814.799999999999
the the well the salesman for the

6812.34 --> 6817.139
the vehicle tractor or whatever it's

6814.8 --> 6818.9400000000005
going to be or just the engine for

6817.139 --> 6821.82
whatever you're going to use it and just

6818.94 --> 6824.58
ask like hey this is the diesel engine

6821.82 --> 6826.98
could this work on biofuel what would I

6824.58 --> 6829.679
do would it need a modification what

6826.98 --> 6831.959999999999
just learn learn about it and they'll

6829.679 --> 6833.82
probably know because biofuels have been

6831.96 --> 6836.099
around and have gotten a lot of

6833.82 --> 6838.739
attention so yeah any engine

6836.099 --> 6841.139
manufacturer especially directing at

6838.739 --> 6843.0599999999995
diesel engines they would be good to

6841.139 --> 6844.619
know this stuff so they should probably

6843.06 --> 6846.42
know it

6844.619 --> 6848.339999999999
so just ask

6846.42 --> 6850.619
if you're actually planning on doing

6848.34 --> 6852.599
something like that

6850.619 --> 6855.0599999999995
of course you're going to do that you're

6852.599 --> 6856.4400000000005
not insane of course you're going to

6855.06 --> 6858.4800000000005
inform yourself before you're actually

6856.44 --> 6861.48
going to try something out like that

6858.48 --> 6861.48
anyway

6865.92 --> 6870.5
drink cooking oil straight into the tank

6868.02 --> 6870.5
really

6872.82 --> 6877.88
directly on oil

6875.28 --> 6877.88
what

6881.94 --> 6888.9
oh yeah we'll we'll build Williams yeah

6886.02 --> 6893.360000000001
there are plenty of YouTube videos all

6888.9 --> 6893.36
about that on YouTube I bet there are

6940.199 --> 6944.46
really

6941.699 --> 6946.699
many better ways to move a machine like

6944.46 --> 6946.699
what

6958.619 --> 6964.38
when it comes to vehicles I actually

6960.9 --> 6966.36
think that combustion engines are really

6964.38 --> 6969.619
cannot be matched

6966.36 --> 6969.619
by any other thing

6970.139 --> 6974.58
uh

6972.179 --> 6976.1990000000005
hydrogen

6974.58 --> 6978.9
runs on

6976.199 --> 6982.638999999999
internal combustion engines

6978.9 --> 6982.638999999999
seeking style water so

6985.98 --> 6990.5599999999995
magnetics

6988.02 --> 6990.56
what

6991.08 --> 6997.38
you mean Electric engines

6993.9 --> 7000.08
they're not very efficient

6997.38 --> 7003.92
like they might be efficient in use but

7000.08 --> 7006.94
as to the energy consumption overall

7003.92 --> 7006.9400000000005
it's not that great

7015.98 --> 7022.098999999999
also like very cold temperatures

7020.06 --> 7024.320000000001
you know very cold temperatures winter

7022.099 --> 7026.119000000001
spells can have a negative influence

7024.32 --> 7028.699
negative impact

7026.119 --> 7031.94
on electric driven cars too I think

7028.699 --> 7034.28
although maybe they've devised a way to

7031.94 --> 7037.82
account for that in regular electric

7034.28 --> 7040.639
cars these days I don't know probably

7037.82 --> 7042.5599999999995
but I I never really thought that

7040.639 --> 7044.9800000000005
electric cars and all that were a great

7042.56 --> 7044.9800000000005
idea

7045.98 --> 7050.78
and it's turning out there's articles

7048.32 --> 7053.659
coming out about this just periodically

7050.78 --> 7057.139
for like last few decades

7053.659 --> 7062.0
like yeah they are a huge power drain

7057.139 --> 7066.400000000001
like they're costing a lot more energy

7062.0 --> 7066.4
than just regular fuel cars

7066.44 --> 7072.08
because yeah you don't notice that as

7069.98 --> 7075.5
you're using it

7072.08 --> 7078.44
but there's just yeah a lot of energy

7075.5 --> 7081.139
and fuel has actually been wasted to

7078.44 --> 7082.219
create all that electricity to pump in

7081.139 --> 7086.4400000000005
your car

7082.219 --> 7086.44
so it's actually not efficient at all

7091.76 --> 7097.58
right I don't know about magnetics what

7095.42 --> 7100.42
does that have to do with Magnetic

7097.58 --> 7100.42
engine what

7110.619 --> 7116.799999999999
Perpetual magnet motors yeah good luck

7113.119 --> 7116.799999999999
with that this is

7122.5 --> 7128.119
steamy traveler what a silly thing to

7125.48 --> 7131.619
say for you

7128.119 --> 7131.619
that Joe were better than that

7131.78 --> 7136.96
it's all right

7133.04 --> 7136.96
I'm gonna run out the show soon anyway

7138.96 --> 7142.149
[Music]

7149.96 --> 7155.56
right so yeah I'm very satisfied about

7152.42 --> 7158.9
today's show it's very fluid

7155.56 --> 7161.599
interesting wide subjects I literally

7158.9 --> 7164.48
just grabbed everything

7161.599 --> 7166.219
even little politics here and there

7164.48 --> 7169.879999999999
and then ended up with this long

7166.219 --> 7171.9800000000005
discussion about fuels and biofuels and

7169.88 --> 7173.84
how how what is best

7171.98 --> 7175.5199999999995
and I like talking about that sort of

7173.84 --> 7176.900000000001
things I'm very environmentally

7175.52 --> 7181.219
interested

7176.9 --> 7184.219
you know like the real thing not some

7181.219 --> 7186.58
[ __ ] trendy oh we got a safe blood

7184.219 --> 7189.9800000000005
it no [ __ ] that

7186.58 --> 7193.699
[ __ ] that [ __ ] right now how about

7189.98 --> 7196.94
just being efficient and clean

7193.699 --> 7200.719
and getting real right that's true

7196.94 --> 7202.46
environmentalism no [ __ ] dreams to

7200.719 --> 7203.78
spread her out and make people feel good

7202.46 --> 7207.92
no

7203.78 --> 7211.639
just get real and efficient

7207.92 --> 7214.58
right that's true environmentalism

7211.639 --> 7217.52
that's how I like to approach it

7214.58 --> 7220.28
and for that you just need to talk about

7217.52 --> 7222.619000000001
it a lot go through what is out there

7220.28 --> 7225.259999999999
what would be a solution what isn't

7222.619 --> 7226.82
turning out to be a solution how do you

7225.26 --> 7229.3
move on

7226.82 --> 7229.299999999999
right

7233.239 --> 7238.759999999999
mini steam Fusion what

7239.78 --> 7246.259999999999
mini what does that even mean

7244.04 --> 7250.219
that's weird I know there are by the way

7246.26 --> 7253.04
gas powered like air compressed

7250.219 --> 7254.599
air-based Vehicles the Japanese have

7253.04 --> 7256.639
made a couple of those like small

7254.599 --> 7259.46
Vehicles almost like

7256.639 --> 7262.34
little motorcycles

7259.46 --> 7263.719
that have like a a tank of super

7262.34 --> 7267.5
compressed air

7263.719 --> 7270.02
and they run for like very very far just

7267.5 --> 7273.199
on pure pressure so there's no

7270.02 --> 7275.96
combustion whatsoever and like

7273.199 --> 7278.48
but they are small Vehicles so it's just

7275.96 --> 7280.639
personal vehicles not yeah it's not

7278.48 --> 7282.98
going to be a hauling truck or something

7280.639 --> 7285.679
that's not gonna work

7282.98 --> 7287.48
but that was interesting too to see that

7285.679 --> 7289.88
come by

7287.48 --> 7291.379999999999
to see that pass by that that's also

7289.88 --> 7295.159000000001
happening

7291.38 --> 7297.7390000000005
over in Japan they got that thing

7295.159 --> 7300.08
anyway I'm gonna round out the show so

7297.739 --> 7302.718999999999
thanks everyone for coming I hope you

7300.08 --> 7304.5199999999995
liked the show I I did I I really

7302.719 --> 7306.82
enjoyed this show

7304.52 --> 7310.280000000001
my shoulder also feels a little better

7306.82 --> 7313.659
PayPal donations helped a lot it really

7310.28 --> 7313.659
did please keep it coming

7314.3 --> 7317.659000000001
I'm not I'm not out of the woods just

7316.82 --> 7320.179
yet

7317.659 --> 7321.619
but this will definitely help a lot on

7320.179 --> 7323.42
the short run

7321.619 --> 7326.0
it's a great relief thank you very much

7323.42 --> 7329.119
I hope also that yeah the show has been

7326.0 --> 7330.5
entertaining and informative and put you

7329.119 --> 7333.199
to thinking

7330.5 --> 7336.56
about things that that actually help

7333.199 --> 7340.5199999999995
yourself in the world

7336.56 --> 7342.8
uh if you like the show then please

7375.08 --> 7378.739
Saturday edition so it's going to be two

7376.639 --> 7380.599
o'clock

7378.739 --> 7382.699
uh and I'm gonna join the Flat Earth

7380.599 --> 7385.099
debates it has just started up I just

7382.699 --> 7388.699
got the notification I'll get on the
