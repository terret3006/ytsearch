211.439 --> 216.12
it's forecast to be a little bit more

213.159 --> 219.319
rainy for the rest of the week and then

216.12 --> 221.56
in the weekend it might be freezing and

219.319 --> 224.56
clearing up a

221.56 --> 224.56
bit

227.319 --> 234.879
H okay so according to this prediction

253.12 --> 257.439
that like

254.439 --> 257.43899999999996
during

264.24 --> 267.56
Autumn I don't

from the same beer even though that was

290.24 --> 294.479
now two days ago I don't know what it is

292.84 --> 298.56
but

294.479 --> 300.96
somehow that stuff like did

298.56 --> 303.88
something

300.96 --> 306.4
and it's still like trying like my

303.88 --> 310.759
system's trying to get it out it's kind

306.4 --> 314.039
of tragic in a way because like

310.759 --> 318.08000000000004
before New Year's Eve I actually felt

314.039 --> 320.84
really good and then after that since

318.08 --> 322.4
I've drunk that one freaking beer like

320.84 --> 326.23999999999995
not so

322.4 --> 326.23999999999995
much but I'll get it

back anyway hello borders boy I could

329.88 --> 332.08
see

335.52 --> 341.639

337.919 --> 344.96
yesterday again very long

341.639 --> 344.96000000000004
show was

353.8 --> 358.479

course or little

426.479 --> 429.479
spoil

429.72 --> 435.40000000000003
uh but yeah I feel like after I've had

433.479 --> 438.96
that I'll be like completely fully

435.4 --> 441.44
restored like more on the physical side

438.96 --> 446.15999999999997
other than that still feel pretty

441.44 --> 448.319
good I have to contact my healer again

455.68 --> 462.759
yesterday it's also very long show it

462.759 --> 468.72
like a New Year's Banning type of show I

466.68 --> 470.879
don't know how many freaking people he

468.72 --> 474.759
he might have like banned like a whole

470.879 --> 478.44
ton of them in the end he was just like

474.759 --> 481.319
you're B you're B your B everybody just

478.44 --> 481.319
kept

481.8 --> 487.96000000000004
doing that

483.639 --> 487.96000000000004
thing hey dupons good to see

500.36 --> 505.12
you I have no Illuminati cassant

506.319 --> 512.919
today just not doing that today I think

511.0 --> 515.88
still I have one I'm just not putting it

512.919 --> 518.8389999999999
in the oven because it just feel

515.88 --> 520.2
weird I'll probably get hungry later but

518.839 --> 523.2
then I'll

520.2 --> 525.36
just

523.2 --> 528.2
get

525.36 --> 532.399
lunch although I do actually have to get

528.2 --> 536.9590000000001
the bread from the store in order to get

532.399 --> 536.959
lunch so whatever I'll make

538.2 --> 541.2
it

543.72 --> 547.48
destruction of the YouTube physics

547.6 --> 551.0
videos yeah yeah

551.92 --> 556.959
yeah a Feer that's a rabbit stew

557.48 --> 560.48
yes

562.56 --> 571.1199999999999
literally like it is a the name of a

566.16 --> 571.12
meal that you can order in Germany

579.0 --> 584.48
it may it basically means like peppered

598.12 --> 601.12
rabbit

601.48 --> 608.64
well anyway yeah it was fun it it's like

604.959 --> 608.64
interesting videos to

609.959 --> 614.5999999999999
review then yeah I did actually also

612.72 --> 617.399
contribute to that it didn't just let

614.6 --> 617.399
Nathan do

618.36 --> 624.8000000000001
everything she was like she just brought

621.8 --> 626.959
it Beyond confessional debating and was

624.8 --> 629.399
like I figured out like that's

626.959 --> 631.4399999999999
paradoxical debating it's not even like

629.399 --> 634.32
like

631.44 --> 636.6
confessing how what you believe or what

634.32 --> 640.36
you claim to be is actually wrong but

636.6 --> 643.5600000000001
just like no just completely saying the

640.36 --> 644.72
opposite and then leaving it there this

643.56 --> 647.5189999999999
is like

644.72 --> 649.72
what didn't you just say it was exactly

647.519 --> 649.72
the

650.6 --> 655.5600000000001
opposite that was

652.68 --> 657.079
weird they might be taking it to a new

655.56 --> 660.76
level God

657.079 --> 663.079
forbid they take this cra even

660.76 --> 666.0
further confessional debating was

663.079 --> 666.0
already crazy

677.44 --> 685.72
enough right okay work I'm not really

681.16 --> 689.36
much of a rabbit either I don't eat

685.72 --> 692.76
rabbits I used to have one and it was

689.36 --> 692.76
really really

708.12 --> 713.88
cute but I get it I mean rabbits

711.68 --> 716.12
especially if you have multiple like you

713.88 --> 718.2
have to like trim them down because

716.12 --> 720.32
otherwise you'll just be surround

718.2 --> 722.839
surrounded by rabbits all the time

720.32 --> 722.839
eating

723.88 --> 727.8389999999999
everything they ruining all your

730.12 --> 734.72
roots although not as bad as goats

741.56 --> 748.0
but never heard of

744.639 --> 751.8
that does it look interesting maybe

748.0 --> 751.8
review Worthy for Flat Earth

753.04 --> 762.68
debates race rabits for ah okay fair

757.72 --> 762.6800000000001
enough rapid fur is really

771.44 --> 777.769
nice

774.13 --> 777.769
[Music]

777.839 --> 780.839
uhoh

800.199 --> 804.88
it sounds it looks like a little it's

802.8 --> 807.76
kind of interesting this

804.88 --> 810.279
channel but I mean it is going to be

807.76 --> 813.6
barded

810.279 --> 817.68
thanks thanks for that video

813.6 --> 817.6800000000001
feed recommendation

823.83 --> 826.889
[Music]

837.759 --> 840.759
tip

853.279 --> 858.079
right hey clutch good to see you happy

855.88 --> 858.079
New

862.56 --> 867.199
Year how you

865.32 --> 870.6800000000001
doing hope

867.199 --> 870.68
you're recovering

871.36 --> 877.6800000000001
still I don't know what his credentials

873.92 --> 878.519
are W who cares you know I mean they

877.68 --> 881.3599999999999
might

878.519 --> 884.92
Care at the Flat Earth debate we don't

881.36 --> 887.0790000000001
really care about your

884.92 --> 889.7199999999999
credentials we just care whether you get

887.079 --> 889.7199999999999
it right or

896.56 --> 902.7589999999999
not going against the main stream while

899.279 --> 905.399
staying in their Paradigm okay how far

902.759 --> 910.0
like anti Flat Earth

905.399 --> 912.04
level or is he just like like a modest

910.0 --> 914.6
glober which is almost like a

912.04 --> 917.7199999999999
contradiction in terms

914.6 --> 919.6800000000001
N I just wanted to say that because I'm

917.72 --> 922.32
a flat

919.68 --> 926.0
earther but

922.32 --> 927.36
uh there are actually modest glowers but

926.0 --> 930.6
I mean if you're going to make videos

927.36 --> 930.6
about it you can't be that

936.8 --> 944.7589999999999
modest right clut yeah no because I've

940.04 --> 944.759
been trying to apply the technique to

946.88 --> 950.079
you and

952.8 --> 957.0
others or or at least like that's what I

955.519 --> 959.68
did

957.0 --> 962.199
uh where

959.68 --> 962.199
two days

967.6 --> 971.839
ago I hoped it had a good

987.519 --> 990.519
influence

991.319 --> 995.4799999999999
right

992.68 --> 996.7589999999999
anyhow yeah what are we going to talk

995.48 --> 1000.279
about

996.759 --> 1000.279
today not really

1011.839 --> 1016.24
sure Brian had an interesting or

1014.68 --> 1019.2399999999999
interesting a good

1016.24 --> 1023.0
video it's a bit dry but I mean it's all

1019.24 --> 1027.439
that math stuff always but ran up loaded

1023.0 --> 1029.64
video right angle elevation triangle of

1027.439 --> 1032.52
Doom basically about how you're going to

1029.64 --> 1036.16
need a flat Earth for that it's always

1032.52 --> 1039.199
good to have just like concise videos

1036.16 --> 1039.199
just laying that

1039.319 --> 1047.3999999999999
out and it's going to be plenty of

1043.919 --> 1050.4
responses to videos like

1047.4 --> 1050.4
that

1054.08 --> 1057.76
what

1056.24 --> 1061.48
neomorphism

1057.76 --> 1061.48
no never heard of

1062.96 --> 1066.32
that Google

1077.08 --> 1080.3999999999999
it oh

1085.679 --> 1089.72
okay yeah that sounds a bit

1107.32 --> 1110.32
silly

1114.28 --> 1119.12
potential matter

1116.88 --> 1125.7990000000002
body and

1119.12 --> 1125.799
the actual namely substantial

1126.4 --> 1131.159
form it's kind of weird to describe that

1132.52 --> 1136.12
way Hy

1136.88 --> 1143.7600000000002
morphism but I mean mean like it does

1140.48 --> 1148.159
sound a little bit like the idea that I

1143.76 --> 1151.08
do also abide by even through the works

1148.159 --> 1153.4
of Rudolph Steiner is that like yeah

1151.08 --> 1156.0
this is just a throne of Flesh and your

1153.4 --> 1160.0
spirit and your Consciousness like

1156.0 --> 1163.039
that's the real you and it exists

1160.0 --> 1165.919
like separate from your body as well

1163.039 --> 1165.919
from your physical

1166.84 --> 1171.3999999999999
body so it's sounds a little bit like

1170.039 --> 1173.8799999999999
that's it might have been like a

1171.4 --> 1177.64
precursor idea of

1173.88 --> 1177.64
that at the ancient

1182.28 --> 1187.24
Greeks and I mean it's not that hard to

1185.4 --> 1190.76
like think of it like that if you just

1187.24 --> 1192.72
take a living human and how they are how

1190.76 --> 1194.64
they recognize things how they respond

1192.72 --> 1197.08
and then oh they're dead and then like

1194.64 --> 1200.8400000000001
yeah that's just a sack of

1197.08 --> 1204.6399999999999
meat if it doesn't have all the old

1200.84 --> 1207.1589999999999
qualities and then yeah it is really

1204.64 --> 1210.2800000000002
like well what is it actually that's

1207.159 --> 1212.0390000000002
making it alive then well the spirit and

1210.28 --> 1213.6
the Consciousness that's what make it

1212.039 --> 1216.559
makes it different so maybe that's like

1213.6 --> 1220.0
a separate body and they're United and

1216.559 --> 1220.0
right that type of

1220.36 --> 1224.28
thinking did you have any thoughts with

1223.52 --> 1227.1589999999999
the

1224.28 --> 1230.1589999999999
word

1227.159 --> 1230.159
duper

1233.2 --> 1235.919
you brought it

1257.12 --> 1260.12
up

1288.64 --> 1293.4
hello

1290.0 --> 1293.4
duper what the

1295.08 --> 1300.799
[ __ ] always ask a question and then walk

1298.559 --> 1303.72
away from your keyboard immediately

1300.799 --> 1308.559
after you always do

1303.72 --> 1308.559
that oh an ad oh okay fair

1312.24 --> 1316.279
enough so what about

1317.039 --> 1321.64
it what did I add

1321.88 --> 1327.0
bro did the ad last like four

1327.84 --> 1331.8799999999999
minutes what the hell are you talking

1337.84 --> 1344.32
about right you brought up hilom

1341.559 --> 1346.9189999999999
morphism then I looked it up looked into

1344.32 --> 1349.3999999999999
it and I I talked about it for like

1346.919 --> 1353.3600000000001
three minutes and then wondering why you

1349.4 --> 1353.3600000000001
weren't responding after asking

1355.44 --> 1364.44
that nothing you just wanted to know my

1359.24 --> 1364.44
opinion okay well apparently that was a

1364.76 --> 1370.36
thing and it sounds like a precursor to

1367.88 --> 1373.44
like the idea of like there's multiple

1370.36 --> 1376.559
bodies besides the physical body there's

1373.44 --> 1378.6000000000001
the the spirit bodies so yeah that's

1376.559 --> 1383.279
kind of what it sounds like a precursor

1378.6 --> 1386.36
of and I very much back that notion it's

1383.279 --> 1386.36
like part of

1387.52 --> 1394.08
the of

1390.72 --> 1397.3600000000001
the the physiological

1394.08 --> 1401.799
idea on which even the technique that I

1397.36 --> 1401.799
apply is based so

1406.88 --> 1409.88
yeah

1416.4 --> 1422.4
wow skill freaking

1418.6 --> 1422.3999999999999
fireworks not as much

1429.26 --> 1432.289

1549.399 --> 1556.1999999999998
podcasts and they've been censored

1552.6 --> 1559.6789999999999
now Mark Zuckerberg really doesn't want

1556.2 --> 1559.679
any peace

1563.12 --> 1570.36
dirty little grabler

heard

1708.48 --> 1713.3990000000001

Australia's

1714.559 --> 1719.399
fake like it's not even funny it's just

1717.44 --> 1722.3990000000001
annoying [ __ ]

1719.399 --> 1722.399
stupid

1726.36 --> 1731.039
anyway oh you think Zuckerberg is data's

1729.72 --> 1734.039
evil

1731.039 --> 1734.039
twin

1734.919 --> 1739.3990000000001
uh maybe a little bit

1747.559 --> 1752.2
but yeah whatever it

1749.279 --> 1755.08
is it's free to make fun of him because

1752.2 --> 1759.919
he literally now banss

1755.08 --> 1765.399
podcasts of actual Jew and Muslim doing

1759.919 --> 1770.24

1782.559 --> 1789.9189999999999
your

1784.88 --> 1792.919
Facebook I know that might require some

1789.919 --> 1795.76
really complicated things but I mean

1792.919 --> 1798.679
it's just like really abandon that ship

1795.76 --> 1804.1589999999999
everybody needs to abandon that he

1798.679 --> 1807.48
literally wants War he just wants war

1804.159 --> 1809.0800000000002
that guy should not even be in business

1807.48 --> 1812.799
at

1809.08 --> 1812.799
all with that kind of

1826.24 --> 1829.24
attitude

1844.279 --> 1850.32
lore yeah that's his name thanks Wy good

1848.0 --> 1850.32
to see

1855.32 --> 1862.2
you was it lur yeah he was called Lura

1858.6 --> 1862.1999999999998

1886.159 --> 1889.159
nerdy

1900.24 --> 1906.039
yeah can you imagine robots laying eggs

1903.44 --> 1906.039
that's just

1914.99 --> 1919.159
[Music]

1916.159 --> 1919.159
weird

1937.399 --> 1942.9189999999999
you went to a Star Trek invention what

1940.24 --> 1942.919
what's wrong with

1943.399 --> 1947.84
that I mean if you do it now you're

1946.519 --> 1952.519
you're gay

1947.84 --> 1952.519
pretty much but I mean in

1953.48 --> 1959.6
1976 that's when it was

1956.24 --> 1959.6
still not

1960.639 --> 1964.519
cool which means it was

1976.039 --> 1981.519
cool

1977.559 --> 1981.519
11 years old right so what's the

1983.32 --> 1987.32
problem did you meet the

1991.2 --> 1996.76
shat don't think Shatner is particularly

1994.399 --> 1999.84
a guy that like goes to all the

1996.76 --> 1999.84
conventions or

2005.96 --> 2010.159
anything oh you did actually

2029.159 --> 2033.44
awesome young

2031.2 --> 2037.679
Sheldon oh my

2033.44 --> 2040.2
God bro that's a slowmo you can time him

2037.679 --> 2040.2
out for

2041.679 --> 2046.48
that I mean that's a pretty serious

2044.48 --> 2050.0
insult

2046.48 --> 2052.96
there since it's kind of like no

2050.0 --> 2057.639
Sheldon's a [ __ ]

2052.96 --> 2057.639
[ __ ] and a [ __ ] who thinks he's

2065.52 --> 2070.879
brilant and most of the time not funny

2068.639 --> 2070.879
but

2091.04 --> 2098.879
anyway

2093.919 --> 2098.879
what okay the cartoon

2104.839 --> 2111.32
you're bad don't worry about

2107.359 --> 2113.96
it just be careful what you call

2111.32 --> 2116.28
people

2113.96 --> 2120.04
H I don't even know what those are

2116.28 --> 2120.0400000000004
slow-mo moon buggy but it sounds

2120.119 --> 2125.32
funny I didn't even know there was a

2122.44 --> 2128.16
Star Trek cartoon no I do but it just

2125.32 --> 2131.119
looked like a comic book

2128.16 --> 2131.1189999999997
with some moving

2140.359 --> 2144.96
Parts

2142.56 --> 2146.64
Tribbles weren't those just like the

2144.96 --> 2150.88
fluffy ball

2146.64 --> 2152.4
things I remember the Star Trek old old

2150.88 --> 2155.92
Star

2152.4 --> 2158.64
Trek where there was like weird fluffy

2155.92 --> 2161.44
balls that would just like multiply out

2158.64 --> 2165.5989999999997
of thin air and then just clog the

2161.44 --> 2165.599
engines or something is that

2167.48 --> 2173.88
those because those things were just

2170.64 --> 2175.5989999999997
toys that were being sold as like yeah

2173.88 --> 2178.44
it's a fluffy

2175.599 --> 2180.44
thing and they were even called tribles

2178.44 --> 2183.319
but I I didn't know that was from Star

2180.44 --> 2183.319
Trek at the

2185.72 --> 2188.72
time

2190.4 --> 2195.6800000000003
horrible cartoon you were into it don't

2193.16 --> 2195.68
worry about

2195.76 --> 2201.92
it I was in some terrible stupid

2199.04 --> 2203.839
cartoons too that thank God like I've

2201.92 --> 2205.359
since then since I realized how

2203.839 --> 2208.04
unbelievably stupid they were I

2205.359 --> 2211.5989999999997
literally like erased them from my

2208.04 --> 2211.599
soul so I don't

2215.68 --> 2218.68
remember

2221.4 --> 2227.56
I mean there were a lot of really stupid

2223.52 --> 2227.56
cartoons around back

2229.56 --> 2235.2
then Mr T Chuck Norris stter

2239.079 --> 2246.2000000000003
yeah wait it was also like it's the time

2243.2 --> 2247.16
where suddenly animated movies became

2246.2 --> 2249.9199999999996
more

2247.16 --> 2252.359
pushed to the Forefront they were

2249.92 --> 2254.7200000000003
actively being made more popular it

2252.359 --> 2257.7999999999997
wasn't like oh it's a grassroot thing no

2254.72 --> 2260.7999999999997
no no that was like artificially being

2257.8 --> 2260.8
pushed

2269.319 --> 2274.359
right because they wanted people to get

2271.92 --> 2274.359
into

2275.599 --> 2278.599
comics

2291.2 --> 2293.7999999999997
logical

2293.88 --> 2299.7200000000003
Val story I think I saw that one can

2296.72 --> 2305.0789999999997
send the link yeah sure if you can find

2299.72 --> 2309.4399999999996
it but Owen Benjamin played that on his

2305.079 --> 2309.44
stream from like last year

2335.52 --> 2338.52
Christmas

2404.0 --> 2410.16
right so yeah sorry for not being super

2406.52 --> 2411.28
active here just kind of waiting I don't

2410.16 --> 2415.1189999999997
feel

2411.28 --> 2415.119
great it's the same as

2415.56 --> 2422.52
yesterday ah oh my God that's that [ __ ]

2419.76 --> 2422.5200000000004
looked so

2425.359 --> 2429.5989999999997
ugly

2426.71 --> 2431.44
[Music]

2429.599 --> 2434.599
now this is definitely not the video

2431.44 --> 2434.599
that om Benjamin was

2438.88 --> 2446.2400000000002
playing right anyway thanks for that for

2442.119 --> 2446.2400000000002
sharing that slow M Moon

2453.96 --> 2460.44
buy wouldn't work go to no no Nathan is

2457.4 --> 2463.92
not missing the point it's just he

2460.44 --> 2466.2000000000003
doesn't care he doesn't care for that

2463.92 --> 2469.119
point would working gy bear don't you

2466.2 --> 2472.3999999999996
understand like Nathan doesn't give a

2469.119 --> 2474.4
[ __ ] that Owen wants to be a comedian or

2472.4 --> 2477.92
is trying to be

2474.4 --> 2477.92
comedic he doesn't

2478.56 --> 2483.92
care and to be fair in the face of like

2481.8 --> 2487.1600000000003
the Flat Earth subject and everything I

2483.92 --> 2489.599
don't really care that much either

2487.16 --> 2492.5989999999997
so it's like yeah no I I like Owen Ben

2489.599 --> 2492.599
he's awesome he's

2492.64 --> 2498.2
funny but he gets things

2496.079 --> 2501.92
wrong especially in the physics

2498.2 --> 2504.839
department and he bites down a big chunk

2501.92 --> 2507.76
the FEA nonsense with The Ether hor [ __ ]

2504.839 --> 2511.599
that he loves so much oh and Benjamin

2507.76 --> 2514.8
you love your ether yeah it's

2511.599 --> 2517.2000000000003
wrong oh but oh so many of your yeah

2514.8 --> 2519.52
they're all wrong

2517.2 --> 2523.4399999999996
all of it is wrong it's all

2519.52 --> 2528.319
wrong and hey you either care to figure

2523.44 --> 2530.7200000000003
out why or you don't care to figure out

2528.319 --> 2535.52
why and considering that he's been

2530.72 --> 2539.04
rolling it out for years I'd say he

2535.52 --> 2542.4
doesn't really care to look into

2539.04 --> 2546.44
why he's just hanging around with his

2542.4 --> 2548.76
friends in his David Wise app and and

2546.44 --> 2551.04
circles and wit it oh and he might have

2548.76 --> 2554.88
wit it on again soon because everybody

2551.04 --> 2556.0
wants him to have wit it on yes yes so

2554.88 --> 2558.92
you should

2556.0 --> 2563.96
realize what that

2558.92 --> 2567.7200000000003
is yeah Owen's kind of a Feasta nonsense

2563.96 --> 2572.0
guy and he thinks he's super good at it

2567.72 --> 2575.5589999999997
and he isn't like he really really

2572.0 --> 2577.68
isn't like I'm better at it could just

2575.559 --> 2579.559
say it out straight yeah he's more

2577.68 --> 2582.04
entertaining he's more charismatic he's

2579.559 --> 2583.92
more successful in life yeah but I'm

2582.04 --> 2587.839
better at this because he's getting it

2583.92 --> 2591.2000000000003
wrong and like who cares though he

2587.839 --> 2594.48
probably doesn't care enough if he'd car

2591.2 --> 2594.48
enough he'd get it

2600.04 --> 2604.359
right like Christopher Gard yeah know

2602.4 --> 2607.2400000000002
and Christopher Gardner is an ether tart

2604.359 --> 2610.52
too they're all a bunch of ether

2607.24 --> 2613.4399999999996
tards yeah ether

2610.52 --> 2618.24
tards people that believe in ether are

2613.44 --> 2618.2400000000002
retards yeah including Nicola

2618.48 --> 2624.319
Tesla pseudo

2620.76 --> 2624.3190000000004
scientist ether

2626.96 --> 2633.96
tards people that can't keep it down to

2630.28 --> 2633.96
earth that's what that

2635.079 --> 2643.92
is and uh jealousy no it's just wrong

2640.0 --> 2643.92

2681.2 --> 2684.5989999999997
interesting but I

2687.359 --> 2693.0789999999997
mean I'm never going to ask him anything

2690.599 --> 2693.079
physics

2693.119 --> 2698.119
related I mean I might even ask him

2695.599 --> 2701.48
constru instruction related thing sure

2698.119 --> 2705.52
physics related yeah [ __ ] off think I'm

2701.48 --> 2705.52
going to ask an ether [ __ ] about

2706.16 --> 2709.16
physics

2715.44 --> 2721.8
no esoteric side of thing bro

2718.48 --> 2723.52
woodworking guny bear like yeah you know

2721.8 --> 2726.28
what is part of the technique through

2723.52 --> 2729.559
rudol sin yeah it's called the ethereal

2726.28 --> 2733.2000000000003
body yeah ether yeah yeah yeah you know

2729.559 --> 2735.6400000000003
what it isn't physics it's not a

2733.2 --> 2737.7999999999997
physical thing or a background medium

2735.64 --> 2739.359
blah blah blah blah blah here goes the

2737.8 --> 2742.8390000000004
Techno bble

2739.359 --> 2744.68
doyo nonsense scatter gun discipline

2742.839 --> 2746.7599999999998
thanks to Ken wheeler and wit it yeah

2744.68 --> 2750.68
yeah yeah that's the thing that I'm like

2746.76 --> 2754.3190000000004
[ __ ] that erase that it's [ __ ] it

2750.68 --> 2756.7599999999998
makes you dumb it's like a micro ball

2754.319 --> 2758.599
Cosmos and if you can repeat it you

2756.76 --> 2761.119
think you're really smart but you're

2758.599 --> 2764.119
actually even more

2761.119 --> 2767.48
[ __ ] than a ball believer that's

2764.119 --> 2770.52
what's really going on yeah that

2767.48 --> 2772.599
horeshit if you're like into physics and

2770.52 --> 2774.359
you think that's real you're a [ __ ]

2772.599 --> 2775.04
[ __ ] you need to get the [ __ ] out of

2774.359 --> 2778.52
the

2775.04 --> 2780.88
physics just just go to healing and all

2778.52 --> 2783.2
that stuff and hey that's great man I do

2780.88 --> 2784.8
that works really well yeah you know

2783.2 --> 2789.0789999999997
what I don't

2784.8 --> 2791.8390000000004
do mix it in with physics

2789.079 --> 2795.1600000000003
talk because that's

2791.839 --> 2798.92
[ __ ] and they don't belong together

2795.16 --> 2798.92
there is no ether in

2814.8 --> 2817.8
physics

2822.28 --> 2827.559
there will be a way to reconcile all of

2824.079 --> 2830.119
it yeah that's right by saying ether is

2827.559 --> 2832.4
pseudo science here's exactly why it's

2830.119 --> 2836.8
pseudo

2832.4 --> 2838.88
science yeah I mean Dr Oto with his

2836.8 --> 2841.04
water crystals and everything what

2838.88 --> 2842.839
declared pseudo science even though

2841.04 --> 2847.48
that's like one of the most useful

2842.839 --> 2849.96
freaking discoveries ever ever yeah and

2847.48 --> 2854.52
he's a pseudoscientist but no ether

2849.96 --> 2854.52
ether ether [ __ ] your ether it's

2854.72 --> 2861.0
[ __ ] yeah ether pseudo science

2858.16 --> 2864.48
anybody that talks ether should just

2861.0 --> 2867.4
have like a giant automated stamp of

2864.48 --> 2869.839
pseudo science by the algorithm right on

2867.4 --> 2873.2400000000002
your [ __ ] forehead every

2869.839 --> 2873.24
time cuz it

2874.359 --> 2881.2799999999997
is you ring up ether pseudo

2877.8 --> 2881.28
science there you

2883.44 --> 2890.079
go if you want to keep your physics

2885.8 --> 2890.079
straight don't listen to that hor

2898.2 --> 2902.16
[ __ ] what the [ __ ] is

2903.48 --> 2909.68
my YouTube

2906.72 --> 2909.68
the hell is

2917.079 --> 2922.6800000000003
this oh Firefox is getting [ __ ]

2919.839 --> 2926.0789999999997
[ __ ] again oh [ __ ] off then yeah

2922.68 --> 2926.0789999999997
that's right

2934.599 --> 2937.599
bye

2942.76 --> 2949.559
really that's still taking 20% of my

2945.88 --> 2953.48
browser of my CPU

2949.559 --> 2953.48
dat my computer's kind of

2953.92 --> 2960.6800000000003
[ __ ] like why the [ __ ] is opening a

2958.079 --> 2964.119
basic

2960.68 --> 2967.0789999999997
browser causing my fan to

2964.119 --> 2970.96
blow because takes so much processor

2967.079 --> 2970.96
time what the [ __ ] is this hor

2989.79 --> 2993.09
[Music]

2994.52 --> 2997.52
[ __ ]

3000.04 --> 3003.839
yeah hey ter 306 good to see

3022.96 --> 3030.2
you no wouldn't working no no physical

3026.96 --> 3032.48
non-physical that's not nobody cares

3030.2 --> 3035.68
there is no blurring

3032.48 --> 3037.079
out physics deals with the physical and

3035.68 --> 3040.3999999999996
natural

3037.079 --> 3044.44
world it doesn't deal with the other

3040.4 --> 3045.839
things and that it never will cuz those

3044.44 --> 3051.44
other

3045.839 --> 3051.44
things have no relation to physics

3052.96 --> 3059.599
yeah Spirits don't alter the way physics

3061.4 --> 3069.76
work and neither does

3064.96 --> 3069.76
either it isn't anything to do

3074.96 --> 3079.48
anything yeah nobody cares about that

3077.319 --> 3084.359
either dupons I don't care that you keep

3079.48 --> 3087.359
on recycling that subject over and over

3084.359 --> 3087.359
again

3087.52 --> 3095.16
yeah like oh people don't don't want

3090.24 --> 3098.24
antim well fine then no nothing then

3095.16 --> 3101.0789999999997
whne and no nothing definitely never

3098.24 --> 3104.24
ever ever become a chemist and get the

3101.079 --> 3107.96
[ __ ] out of my face then

3104.24 --> 3111.0789999999997
yeah yeah [ __ ] off then like what are

3107.96 --> 3113.2
you whining about ATS are not real yeah

3111.079 --> 3117.3590000000004
well good you'll never ever become a

3113.2 --> 3117.359
chemist now get the [ __ ] out of my sight

3118.359 --> 3121.92
yeah nobody

3122.4 --> 3125.64
cares it

3127.359 --> 3134.2799999999997
works there's literally nothing better

3130.16 --> 3137.0
that exists that works so stop whining

3134.28 --> 3139.6800000000003
about it like present your alternative

3137.0 --> 3142.079
model that works even better or shut the

3139.68 --> 3144.04
[ __ ] up about it seriously it's not just

3142.079 --> 3147.28
to you duper it's to everybody that's

3144.04 --> 3147.2799999999997
whining about that

3150.88 --> 3156.4
yeah and when I'm say works better I

3153.88 --> 3159.2400000000002
mean actually works better and not just

3156.4 --> 3159.2400000000002
in your [ __ ]

3162.96 --> 3170.04
math like with a higher accuracy yield

3166.68 --> 3173.64
rate in chemical processes yeah you can

3170.04 --> 3177.799
get a a better than the atomic model

3173.64 --> 3181.48
model good prove it it apply that model

3177.799 --> 3184.64
and then get a higher accuracy yield

3181.48 --> 3187.64
rate with your chemical

3184.64 --> 3187.64
tests

3188.359 --> 3194.72
yeah when you got that we can talk for

3192.64 --> 3199.1189999999997
that shut the [ __ ]

3194.72 --> 3201.5589999999997
up stop whining about not having

3199.119 --> 3204.52
enough it's not good

3201.559 --> 3208.2000000000003
enough shut the [ __ ] up seriously pisses

3204.52 --> 3210.119
me off do something then stop whining

3208.2 --> 3212.9199999999996
about things that are there and way

3210.119 --> 3215.2000000000003
better than any of you could have ever

3212.92 --> 3219.7200000000003
thought up

3215.2 --> 3222.64
okay have something better that works

3219.72 --> 3224.9599999999996
then and stop whining about the things

3222.64 --> 3228.359
that are in place that

3224.96 --> 3228.359
work if you

3234.16 --> 3237.16
don't

3244.799 --> 3249.92
oh you got to get your team to high

3246.0 --> 3249.92
school okay slow-mo yeah see you

3254.079 --> 3261.1600000000003
later I just don't want to get in oh man

3258.4 --> 3263.319
it's just fuing bickering day isn't it

3261.16 --> 3265.92
so Owen got caught up in a total

3263.319 --> 3267.799
bickering show yesterday

3265.92 --> 3269.28
mostly bickering got kind of funny at

3267.799 --> 3272.24
the

3269.28 --> 3274.119
end and it's just here it's like I

3272.24 --> 3276.0
didn't want to do that I don't want to

3274.119 --> 3278.6400000000003
do it I don't want to bicker I don't

3276.0 --> 3282.28
want to [ __ ] bicker I don't want I

3278.64 --> 3284.7599999999998
refuse to bicker you hear me God I will

3282.28 --> 3288.1600000000003
not [ __ ]

3284.76 --> 3291.8390000000004
bicker I will rather just re end the

3288.16 --> 3297.0789999999997
show instead I refuse to [ __ ] bicker

3291.839 --> 3297.0789999999997
I hate it I hate everything about it

3299.839 --> 3302.359
not doing

3314.599 --> 3322.1600000000003
it but I mean atomist allergies do do

3318.88 --> 3324.359
actually piss me off

3322.16 --> 3327.0389999999998
though like I don't care if you're going

3324.359 --> 3330.319
to make it the new [ __ ] religion

3327.039 --> 3330.3190000000004
it'll still piss me

3330.44 --> 3334.559
off right once you give up on the ball

3333.119 --> 3336.92
Earth and then it's like oh yeah but

3334.559 --> 3338.559
atomism is just not real it's something

3336.92 --> 3342.48
else and you make that into the new

3338.559 --> 3342.48
world religion it'll still piss me

3348.599 --> 3354.0
off bicker is a weird word though sure

3352.48 --> 3357.0
it

3354.0 --> 3357.0
is

3365.52 --> 3369.119
hello by the way Tommy good to see

3383.92 --> 3386.92
you

3413.88 --> 3416.88
what

3440.599 --> 3446.799
wow by the way if tomorrow I feel even

3444.599 --> 3446.799
like

3447.079 --> 3452.079
half of what I feel today I'm just not

3449.52 --> 3452.079
going to do a

3452.48 --> 3459.079
show this like I feel very uncomfortable

3455.96 --> 3462.92
pretty much all the time

3459.079 --> 3465.4
now since yes it's sucks I need to get

3462.92 --> 3468.76
this out of my system whatever

3465.4 --> 3471.64
happened [ __ ]

3468.76 --> 3473.7990000000004
beer although it probably wasn't just

3471.64 --> 3476.52
the

3473.799 --> 3478.7599999999998
beer

3476.52 --> 3481.0
maybe it's just exposure to all like the

3478.76 --> 3484.6400000000003
chemical smoke from the firework I don't

3481.0 --> 3484.64
know what the hell

3485.64 --> 3490.52
happen but I just don't feel super

3488.76 --> 3492.7990000000004
comfortable right now which is a shame

3490.52 --> 3495.52
because I did like three days ago felt

3492.799 --> 3495.52
like super

3498.119 --> 3504.0
fit have a great and bigger free day all

3502.2 --> 3506.52
right woodworking gy Bear yeah talk to

3504.0 --> 3509.64
you later

3506.52 --> 3509.64
how can ether be it

3511.079 --> 3520.7200000000003
can't doesn't exist doons there is no

3515.52 --> 3520.72
ether it does not exist it's made

3528.0 --> 3531.0
up

3531.359 --> 3536.72
right just like dark matter is made up

3563.64 --> 3566.64
for

3567.4 --> 3573.839
what the hell does that mean wrangling a

3570.359 --> 3573.839
dog that's just

3593.64 --> 3596.64
weird

3599.559 --> 3604.8390000000004
I don't know what AR's failure has

3601.359 --> 3604.839
anything to do with that orle

3620.039 --> 3623.44
wble but

3623.559 --> 3626.559
hello

3638.799 --> 3642.64
okay right fair enough if that's what

3640.88 --> 3645.2400000000002
you say I mean I don't know if that's

3642.64 --> 3646.799
actually the case

3645.24 --> 3651.0789999999997
but

3646.799 --> 3655.359
yeah there is no ether yeah Tesla was

3651.079 --> 3657.48
wrong the guy who married his epig

3655.359 --> 3659.92
was

3657.48 --> 3662.359
wrong how dare you but he did all these

3659.92 --> 3664.52
things yeah oh it's almost like he's

3662.359 --> 3668.359
being pushed by the mainstream isn't he

3664.52 --> 3670.7599999999998
is like this oh this suppressed hero was

3668.359 --> 3673.16
just rebelling against yeah that's why

3670.76 --> 3674.7990000000004
he's [ __ ] mainstream and is pushed

3673.16 --> 3678.72
like

3674.799 --> 3681.359
everywhere as in like not by literally

3678.72 --> 3684.0
by the mainstream but he's seated

3681.359 --> 3685.68
everywhere like try to find a freaking

3684.0 --> 3688.24
person out there in this world that

3685.68 --> 3691.24
doesn't know about Tesla

3688.24 --> 3694.4799999999996
roughly right I mean everybody's heard

3691.24 --> 3697.839
of that why because it's

3694.48 --> 3700.92
everywhere in

3697.839 --> 3704.24
everything they want you to know about

3700.92 --> 3707.6800000000003
Tesla they want you to think of him as

3704.24 --> 3707.68
like this secret electric

3708.48 --> 3712.559
genius even though he pushed

3713.44 --> 3720.4
ether they want it they want you to

3717.2 --> 3723.359
worship idiots yeah just like they want

3720.4 --> 3723.359
you to worship

3725.839 --> 3731.599
Einstein that's what they

3728.079 --> 3731.599
want they want

3732.599 --> 3739.92
freaks that got certain ideas that

3736.119 --> 3742.52
are SL above average at at least right

3739.92 --> 3744.44
but that are wrong that are very very

3742.52 --> 3748.079
wrong and then they want anybody that's

3744.44 --> 3751.16
sticks out beyond the average to latch

3748.079 --> 3753.52
onto those things because they the

3751.16 --> 3756.16
slightly smarter people associate that

3753.52 --> 3759.079
with being special boy or you know about

3756.16 --> 3763.5989999999997
the special boy so you're smarter and

3759.079 --> 3766.76
then you learn their incorrect

3763.599 --> 3770.88
ideas that's why they do

3766.76 --> 3770.88
it that's why they promote

3772.48 --> 3779.039
Tesla CU it popular IES

3776.039 --> 3779.039
incorrect

3779.119 --> 3782.4
ideas like

3803.279 --> 3806.279
ether

3852.68 --> 3861.0789999999997
the gas has to pass yeah I don't know

3855.839 --> 3866.2
duper I think wit it is like genuinely

3861.079 --> 3866.2000000000003
provably register [ __ ]

3866.44 --> 3873.44
and that his own little wheelie that he

3869.88 --> 3875.599
keeps doing like literally makes him

3873.44 --> 3878.4
demented in order for him to make

3875.599 --> 3878.4
statements like

3886.079 --> 3892.3590000000004
that yeah if he's claiming oh gas has to

3890.039 --> 3897.5200000000004
pass through something so it must be e

3892.359 --> 3901.119
no no no you [ __ ] [ __ ] it's called

3897.52 --> 3907.0389999999998
space a available

3901.119 --> 3910.48
volume room for things to exist in yeah

3907.039 --> 3915.599
that's what gas passes through just like

3910.48 --> 3920.079
what light passes through yeah available

3915.599 --> 3923.52
space which it just Avail Space Room

3920.079 --> 3924.92
doesn't exist it has to be ether there's

3923.52 --> 3928.64
no

3924.92 --> 3930.96
space like a volume that that doesn't

3928.64 --> 3934.839
exist there is no volume there is only

3930.96 --> 3934.839
ether because she's a [ __ ]

3940.599 --> 3947.079
[ __ ] he doesn't wit doesn't believe in

3943.799 --> 3947.079
volume there's only

3953.079 --> 3956.079
ether

3981.92 --> 3987.279
all right so now got a bicker title

3984.72 --> 3990.0
after all with the nice straw man in

3987.279 --> 3990.0
there who

3993.799 --> 3999.2
cares but I mean it's

3996.2 --> 4000.4399999999996
something something to talk about and it

3999.2 --> 4005.52
is

4000.44 --> 4007.599
true heard it so many times from wit it

4005.52 --> 4010.279
agitates the [ __ ] out of me every time

4007.599 --> 4012.6800000000003
he does it makes me want to beat him

4010.279 --> 4012.68
with a

4013.0 --> 4016.0
stick

4032.119 --> 4037.6800000000003
guys passes through nothing this this an

4034.68 --> 4039.5989999999997
asine what you mean available

4037.68 --> 4042.799
volume

4039.599 --> 4044.88
nothing is that an asite claim so if you

4042.799 --> 4047.88
like d

4044.88 --> 4050.559
compress a vacuum chamber you get all

4047.88 --> 4053.44
the gas out did does that mean you just

4050.559 --> 4053.44
filled it with

4055.96 --> 4064.4
ether I'm a ether

4060.279 --> 4067.599
[ __ ] there's no volume there's only

4064.4 --> 4072.039
ether it can't be going through nothing

4067.599 --> 4075.0
that sh asine claim it has to be either

4072.039 --> 4078.559
cuz there's no empty volumes that

4075.0 --> 4078.559
doesn't exist it must be

4102.839 --> 4105.839
ether

4124.159 --> 4128.639999999999
right so is that it am I going to round

4125.96 --> 4128.64
out the show

4132.799 --> 4135.799
now

4142.0 --> 4145.48
W it could also be a

4145.679 --> 4149.319
gatekeeper how does that

4150.719 --> 4156.08
work I mean I did not know that he had

4153.6 --> 4158.120000000001
like his own media station with a lot of

4156.08 --> 4161.64
connections and everything and in order

4158.12 --> 4161.64
for him to be some kind of a

4162.719 --> 4167.08
gatekeeper

4164.56 --> 4167.080000000001
who is he

4183.159 --> 4189.2789999999995
gatekeeping I just think he's like a

4186.199 --> 4192.719
state like a Feasta nonsense guy and

4189.279 --> 4194.8
those that's like Grassroots controlled

4192.719 --> 4198.159
opposition

4194.8 --> 4200.4800000000005
they just come and meet to rise the

4198.159 --> 4204.239
demand of the system to have a

4200.48 --> 4206.959999999999
controlled opposition against re

4204.239 --> 4210.12
reality he's connected to the

4206.96 --> 4211.92
globas okay well for them it's pretty

4210.12 --> 4213.5599999999995
much the same I don't even see how they

4211.92 --> 4216.08
are actually

4213.56 --> 4219.8
Gatekeepers other than

4216.08 --> 4222.64
their dealers of feista nonsense which

4219.8 --> 4225.400000000001
makes them get

4222.64 --> 4229.400000000001
promoted because that's what the system

4225.4 --> 4232.239
wants it wants people to get into

4229.4 --> 4234.159
nonsense that's provable nonsense and

4232.239 --> 4236.199
then make that popular and spread it

4234.159 --> 4238.32
around so everybody believes in that

4236.199 --> 4240.678999999999
nonsense as an alternative to the

4238.32 --> 4243.0
mainstream nonsense right what they

4240.679 --> 4245.52
don't want is you to actually figure out

4243.0 --> 4245.52
the real

4245.88 --> 4252.08
things so yeah you talk a lot of hor

4249.0 --> 4254.8
[ __ ] but people aren't figuring it out

4252.08 --> 4256.0
that it's hor [ __ ] you get to go to the

4254.8 --> 4261.92
front of the

4256.0 --> 4261.92
line you get the luxury seat

4267.12 --> 4273.04
then okay tomino well I don't know where

4270.04 --> 4274.88
you got that but that makes even less

4273.04 --> 4278.36
sense

4274.88 --> 4281.400000000001
no there's just no ether it's not a dome

4278.36 --> 4286.239
it's not available volume or what is in

4281.4 --> 4288.28
between or there to meet the necessity

4286.239 --> 4290.32
for a medium for things that are

4288.28 --> 4294.08
considered as a wave when they

4290.32 --> 4296.96
aren't yeah there just isn't any either

4294.08 --> 4300.12
it's literally a madeup word that

4296.96 --> 4304.0
literally applies to

4300.12 --> 4309.159
nothing yeah that's the reality of it

4304.0 --> 4309.159
it's a madeup word that applies to

4312.56 --> 4315.56
nothing

4318.12 --> 4323.679
have I been there I don't have to be

4320.84 --> 4327.84
anywhere to know that what I'm talking

4323.679 --> 4331.08
about is correct there is no ether

4327.84 --> 4335.12
nothing is The Ether do you understand

4331.08 --> 4339.4
whatever is it's not ether because ether

4335.12 --> 4342.719
isn't it does not exist it's made up and

4339.4 --> 4344.08
anything that we might find out figure

4342.719 --> 4347.679
out

4344.08 --> 4351.08
bump into is not going to be ether

4347.679 --> 4354.2390000000005
because ether does not exist it's made

4351.08 --> 4357.639
up yeah just like you're never ever

4354.239 --> 4360.759999999999
going to bounce into dark matter because

4357.639 --> 4364.28
it's made up it never

4360.76 --> 4367.4800000000005
existed and you can know that about

4364.28 --> 4371.239
it now I want you to know that about the

4367.48 --> 4373.599999999999
ether as well is the same thing the same

4371.239 --> 4377.4
process the same end result made of up

4373.6 --> 4377.400000000001
horse [ __ ] doesn't apply to

4378.96 --> 4381.96
anything

4402.36 --> 4405.36
okay

4422.84 --> 4428.0
