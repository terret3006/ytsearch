158.64 --> 164.30999999999997
let's go through the chat quickly so AGM

161.7 --> 169.5
was first today Amanda you know Tom

164.31 --> 175.65
Parker who is my guest on a plane matrix

169.5 --> 182.31
media Oprah moko and dusty Flint gravels

175.65 --> 185.91
porn Robin Stanley Phillip Cooper yeah

182.31 --> 191.91
good to see you all so yeah I got Tom

185.91 --> 196.37
Parker holding on with me on skype so

191.91 --> 198.0
Tom Parker are you there yeah I'm here

196.37 --> 200.39000000000001
all right

198.0 --> 205.38
yeah good to have you on the show thank

200.39 --> 208.35
you good to be here all right so yeah

205.38 --> 211.65
you wanted to talk about some ethereal

208.35 --> 215.54
subjects today I guess

211.65 --> 219.72
concerning stars again maybe orbs and

215.54 --> 221.4
yeah where we previously left off yeah I

219.72 --> 224.31
mean I wish I had a little bit more info

221.4 --> 227.04
but like I'm just gonna read one

224.31 --> 230.37
definition here okay okay like this

227.04 --> 232.44
comes from in Genesis where very first

230.37 --> 235.47
chapter it talks about you know God made

232.44 --> 239.1
the Stars if you look that up in the

235.47 --> 243.18
Hebrew that were the stars one of the

239.1 --> 246.78
definitions is heavenly power and then

243.18 --> 249.33
in parentheses it says that serve God

246.78 --> 252.12
you know cuz I last week I kind of made

249.33 --> 255.78
the reference that I believe stars are

252.12 --> 257.91
angels and I think some are good some

255.78 --> 260.88
are bad I think there's also bad ones up

257.91 --> 263.79
there so that's just like I say when

260.88 --> 267.24
words mean things and not what does that

263.79 --> 269.46000000000004
mean to you because look look when you

267.24 --> 271.32
get the metaphorical there's

269.46 --> 272.88
metaphorical things when you start

271.32 --> 275.43
saying those kind of things and then

272.88 --> 281.43
there's the physical consequences

275.43 --> 284.28000000000003
effects influences the data so how would

281.43 --> 286.56
you like to approach this because you

284.28 --> 288.97999999999996
have to say they are angels you know

286.56 --> 292.01
when we think of angels we think of

288.98 --> 295.65000000000003
humanoid beings with wings that are

292.01 --> 297.57
servants of the Creator as it were well

295.65 --> 299.54999999999995
when we look up there I see a point of

297.57 --> 301.38
light and when you go up high enough

299.55 --> 304.169
they apparently go away or something

301.38 --> 307.44
it's complicated it's a holographic

304.169 --> 309.47999999999996
phenomena rather so but I put in their

307.44 --> 311.91
place to do what they do to give us

309.48 --> 313.74
light that for us to see them and as far

311.91 --> 315.35
as these angels have in these wings I

313.74 --> 318.72
mean that's more man-made stuff than

315.35 --> 320.97
biblical stuff you know I'm not sure if

318.72 --> 323.22
any we're in the Bible it mentions that

320.97 --> 325.95000000000005
the actually have wings indenter maybe

323.22 --> 329.13000000000005
one class of anything so I think there

325.95 --> 332.64
look I think there is plenty of mention

329.13 --> 336.18
about descriptions within houses and

332.64 --> 338.21
rings yeah and most of the time winter

336.18 --> 341.79
described him and he take on human form

338.21 --> 343.44
right so I mean I went on the human form

341.79 --> 348.41900000000004
they don't have wings no but they are

343.44 --> 350.85
then like incognito kind of thing right

348.419 --> 352.44
they can be whatever they want to be I

350.85 --> 355.38
believe you know I believe they can

352.44 --> 357.81
transform into just about anything it

355.38 --> 361.979
all even really depends on what you

357.81 --> 364.86
think that they are because yeah well on

361.979 --> 368.55
the other side I've seen angel related

364.86 --> 373.13
things and and even stranger beings very

368.55 --> 376.13
much Hindu like God things and Buddha

373.13 --> 378.17
like it's a saying there's toes evil

376.13 --> 380.87
part of it to us so but but what I'm

378.17 --> 383.33000000000004
saying is that in angelic Encounters who

380.87 --> 386.54
says that that is in the physical real

383.33 --> 390.37
world rather than in the dream world and

386.54 --> 394.61
then reflecting upon the real world

390.37 --> 396.71
because that is a kid I think it has a

394.61 --> 398.54
biblical point of view you know creation

396.71 --> 401.53999999999996
point of view you know I mean I think

398.54 --> 404.15000000000003
everything we see is real was created by

401.54 --> 405.74
God you know it's up to us whether we

404.15 --> 408.34999999999997
accept that or not I mean because you

405.74 --> 411.26
got two choices I mean you got creation

408.35 --> 414.89000000000004
or you got Big Bang I mean you know

411.26 --> 417.26
there's nothing in between that you know

414.89 --> 420.14
I mean anywhere you look in nature you

417.26 --> 423.68
see design right no to have a design you

420.14 --> 425.78
got to have a designer of course you

423.68 --> 428.63
know so now but I'm not saying that

425.78 --> 430.48999999999995
angels are not real or not as the

428.63 --> 434.96
business Bible says them I'm just saying

430.49 --> 437.0
I'm trying to really put put them more

434.96 --> 439.60999999999996
in the real-world experience in a way

437.0 --> 442.64
and yeah I've never seen physical be

439.61 --> 445.85
I've seen people having amazing energy

442.64 --> 448.01
and even like certain Christians in

445.85 --> 449.57000000000005
moments just have this amazing purity

448.01 --> 451.64
that you would think that the Angels

449.57 --> 453.89
were with them that kind of thing and

451.64 --> 458.0
you know that they do no harm whatsoever

453.89 --> 461.63
they couldn't even conceive it and so is

458.0 --> 464.24
it literal or is it like on the other

461.63 --> 468.95
side and it will become metaphorically

464.24 --> 471.62
real in the dream and then that doesn't

468.95 --> 474.40999999999997
mean that there aren't these energies

471.62 --> 479.39
and these beings potentially that ride

474.41 --> 483.26000000000005
with us you know yeah does that make any

479.39 --> 484.88
sense are real I mean I just I think

483.26 --> 487.96999999999997
it's all real I don't think there's any

484.88 --> 494.15
I'm not saying it's not real I'm saying

487.97 --> 496.34000000000003
it may be real in another sense not

494.15 --> 499.65999999999997
physically literal but more

496.34 --> 502.38899999999995
metaphorically but based on real

499.66 --> 506.21900000000005
experiences that keep on happening

502.389 --> 511.21000000000004
and that have effects that keep on

506.219 --> 512.829
establishing so yeah yeah I mean I mean

511.21 --> 514.93
a lot of people do kind of think it that

512.829 --> 517.6899999999999
way I think it's literal you know I

514.93 --> 523.959
think every everything is you know

517.69 --> 526.8000000000001
everything in the Bible anyways so I

523.959 --> 529.8389999999999
haven't read through all of it just yet

526.8 --> 533.38
I'm basically trying to relate to my

529.839 --> 537.2790000000001
personal experiences and and and yeah my

533.38 --> 540.04
senses of things how I feel something

537.279 --> 544.149
out whether it is in a dream or in the

540.04 --> 546.519
real world yeah anyway yeah I I

544.149 --> 548.44
understand what you go but least desktop

546.519 --> 550.0600000000001
often just feelings and stuff I mean

548.44 --> 552.1
that's when we get ourselves in trouble

550.06 --> 553.51
then we're not just feelings also

552.1 --> 556.36
principles of course

553.51 --> 558.1899999999999
listen figure it out that was very

556.36 --> 561.5790000000001
complicated for me when I was young

558.19 --> 565.72
right I went purely by feelings I didn't

561.579 --> 569.079
understand logos the structure as to why

565.72 --> 571.9590000000001
so was it yeah kind of like a liberal in

569.079 --> 574.17
that way that's problematic and then now

571.959 --> 576.699
I'm figuring it figuring it all out

574.17 --> 580.87
signal that it's not just good you have

576.699 --> 584.2299999999999
to use and use certain methods and avoid

580.87 --> 588.339
others and it's about the path not just

584.23 --> 591.839
the the moments of good that you seek

588.339 --> 591.839
out so

592.24 --> 596.9300000000001
right and like I say if you haven't read

595.069 --> 599.36
the book Enoch it's something you may

596.93 --> 601.25
want to read because it's just it puts a

599.36 --> 602.9300000000001
whole different spin on that on what the

601.25 --> 607.43
stars really are and how they work and

602.93 --> 608.18
you can actually watch what he says come

607.43 --> 610.91
to pass

608.18 --> 612.769
month after month of how these stars and

610.91 --> 615.889
moon in the Sun out really how they work

612.769 --> 618.5600000000001
how you get the seasons I mean what they

615.889 --> 621.23
are I mean I know ya do something you

618.56 --> 625.3389999999999
would enjoy well I've heard flat waters

621.23 --> 628.79
videos about it he like read it out very

625.339 --> 631.22
long videos with pictures background so

628.79 --> 634.639
yeah I've read it through him basically

631.22 --> 640.4590000000001
I don't have the book I just have a

634.639 --> 644.0
Bible and that's it but but yeah I've

640.459 --> 646.2199999999999
heard about it and one of the more

644.0 --> 648.319
interesting things were talk of portals

646.22 --> 651.759
concert like portals of the yes to the

648.319 --> 657.11
east west and that just means like

651.759 --> 660.23
portals really really so I think it's

657.11 --> 667.5790000000001
just holographic and well what was

660.23 --> 671.36
making the hologram energy energy that

667.579 --> 675.9799999999999
makes light manifest somehow in a

671.36 --> 679.339
specific pattern what a pattern boy has

675.98 --> 683.089
been perfected and you know followed for

679.339 --> 685.49
6,000 years that's one heck of a energy

683.089 --> 687.4390000000001
level you know dance I mean that's why

685.49 --> 691.16
you got to put the creation on it to in

687.439 --> 695.11
my point of view of course that it

691.16 --> 695.11
wasn't it yeah

695.15 --> 703.1
I don't know machole difficult because

698.839 --> 705.83
we don't know yeah what happened or like

703.1 --> 708.9200000000001
how things were completely like like

705.83 --> 710.9300000000001
extreme long times ago if everything was

708.92 --> 715.52
always there if the start or was like

710.93 --> 719.4499999999999
this and but from recorded history it

715.52 --> 721.6999999999999
seems to be always exactly the same with

719.45 --> 727.13
some weird events though they do happen

721.7 --> 728.69
those weird events some of the

727.13 --> 731.96
alignments that take place I mean just

728.69 --> 733.4300000000001
not too long ago what what was a

731.96 --> 737.86
December of last year I think it was

733.43 --> 742.55
that one alignment came with all of them

737.86 --> 744.29
up there like ten eleven planets or

742.55 --> 747.1999999999999
whatever all lined up and went through

744.29 --> 749.2099999999999
the Virgo when all that stuff might have

747.2 --> 750.07
been two years ago and all but just it's

749.21 --> 754.58
unbelievable

750.07 --> 755.7
remember all signs you know pointing to

754.58 --> 756.97
something

755.7 --> 762.7900000000001
[Music]

756.97 --> 766.52
yeah pointing yeah look it's it seems

762.79 --> 771.89
it's astrology and the energy workings

766.52 --> 774.29
and yeah that it's something else and I

771.89 --> 777.1899999999999
guess that even the Book of Enoch kind

774.29 --> 781.76
of touches upon that but I don't know I

777.19 --> 784.7900000000001
don't know really why it does work that

781.76 --> 786.79
way or where that energy where it is

784.79 --> 789.29
being created is it being injected

786.79 --> 793.3389999999999
externally from like physically the

789.29 --> 797.029
outside is it the side effect of

793.339 --> 800.69
everything as it is or is there a

797.029 --> 803.24
specific specific set unchangeable

800.69 --> 806.57
element somewhere within the creation of

803.24 --> 809.45
this realm that allows this to be

806.57 --> 812.5400000000001
projected unchangingly in that pattern

809.45 --> 814.94
because it's not bound by physical

812.54 --> 817.16
matter because then it would probably be

814.94 --> 819.5200000000001
much more subjective all to change even

817.16 --> 821.7199999999999
at least at points so anyway I've

819.52 --> 823.91
personally been interested in that

821.72 --> 827.0
concept i've even entertained it early

823.91 --> 831.019
on like what if some

827.0 --> 834.709
I don't know big place like really blew

831.019 --> 837.5600000000001
up somewhere like yeah let's not even go

834.709 --> 839.3889999999999
there but just like some landscape part

837.56 --> 841.8789999999999
would be radically altered would that

839.389 --> 844.72
directly then start to reflect upon how

841.879 --> 847.49
the heavens look like and then you can

844.72 --> 849.8000000000001
understand the correlation potentially

847.49 --> 853.1
between the matter in the realm and the

849.8 --> 855.319
heavens but so far it doesn't seem to

853.1 --> 858.3190000000001
really work like that and you don't

855.319 --> 860.75
really want to test that experiment if

858.319 --> 864.139
you know what I mean no yeah

860.75 --> 865.579
you mess with the darkness out there I

864.139 --> 868.699
mean that will bite you I mean Esther

865.579 --> 870.31
that that spiritual realm is real you

868.699 --> 873.3789999999999
know and there's some wicked wickedness

870.31 --> 876.829
in high places out there and you go

873.379 --> 878.259
looking for you will find it they'll

876.829 --> 885.29
find you

878.259 --> 886.4300000000001
there's nothing mess with there and then

885.29 --> 892.639
I'm sure we've all been there and done

886.43 --> 898.75
stupid things wickedly and it's hard to

892.639 --> 904.61
break from that man some scary [ __ ] yeah

898.75 --> 907.97
yeah I yes I mean we could feel dark and

904.61 --> 913.5500000000001
we can feel light right I mean the

907.97 --> 916.129
darkness good and the evil I mean so if

913.55 --> 923.149
you can feel it one I see sometimes you

916.129 --> 925.97
well to be fair with Psychopaths it's

923.149 --> 929.6
really tough to feel because they don't

925.97 --> 932.75
really have a natural feeling response

929.6 --> 936.9200000000001
and so I can't really read much of them

932.75 --> 940.16
as they do it and the a combined that

936.92 --> 945.5
with being very computer confused that's

940.16 --> 947.3
very dangerous combination and I think

945.5 --> 948.949
for the most part in anybody knows if

947.3 --> 951.439
they're doing good or bad I mean it's

948.949 --> 953.689
like it's in our nature

951.439 --> 956.8389999999999
you know I mean your contents will let

953.689 --> 958.91
you know if you're you know something

956.839 --> 960.589
sometimes it may be blurred or you don't

958.91 --> 963.799
have as much feeling just because of

960.589 --> 970.249
whatever but you know person knows right

963.799 --> 972.379
from wrong well the the point is with

970.249 --> 975.409
the system of the conscious which is

972.379 --> 977.659
like a yeah nerve relating response

975.409 --> 983.749
system influences your metabolism all

977.659 --> 987.399
kinds of things that has yeah conscious

983.749 --> 991.249
and thus moral reflection as a

987.399 --> 995.569
physiological response so that that can

991.249 --> 998.3290000000001
be measured but you I I don't know I

995.569 --> 1001.449
think people can also sense it some

998.329 --> 1003.3689999999999
people a lot better than others but if

1001.449 --> 1006.039
there's no physiological response

1003.369 --> 1009.999
because that system is not there then it

1006.039 --> 1012.639
becomes very tough to make it out if

1009.999 --> 1017.529
they're just acting or if they believe

1012.639 --> 1019.149
something is real I mean even if you

1017.529 --> 1021.22
meet people that are like really dark

1019.149 --> 1023.379
like early on the hillside I mean they

1021.22 --> 1027.49
freaking all they're evil right I mean

1023.379 --> 1030.159
II know where of course you know so I

1027.49 --> 1032.019
mean if they know that portion of it

1030.159 --> 1037.48
they also what there's the opposite to

1032.019 --> 1039.879
it well we have evil or days or they

1037.48 --> 1042.129
just say evil really doesn't exist and

1039.879 --> 1044.289
it's about something else and there's

1042.129 --> 1049.5
some mysterious greater good of which

1044.289 --> 1049.5
the actual resolve eludes them forever

1052.42 --> 1063.01
that's one way to keep yourself in the

1056.71 --> 1066.51
dark and there's one way to stay out of

1063.01 --> 1066.51
the dark read that Bible

1067.11 --> 1072.81
well I does certainly make impact

1072.87 --> 1078.76
absolutely it didn't leave altering for

1076.15 --> 1080.5
me it wasn't even as much as like

1078.76 --> 1085.09
reading the Bible although I thought

1080.5 --> 1088.24
yeah it's still under way but it really

1085.09 --> 1091.6599999999999
was for me just from not being used to

1088.24 --> 1094.95
it like stepping towards a a community

1091.66 --> 1098.0500000000002
of people that are Christians or yeah

1094.95 --> 1099.67
well these are like Mormons but they're

1098.05 --> 1103.6299999999999
still very Christian they have that

1099.67 --> 1105.97
light and that was like so impactful

1103.63 --> 1108.1000000000001
just being among these people seeing how

1105.97 --> 1109.96
they were what they were carrying inside

1108.1 --> 1114.85
that it was so well so much lights a

1109.96 --> 1118.18
little poison in there like negativity

1114.85 --> 1122.08
and that yeah it can in a way almost be

1118.18 --> 1125.77
nauseating but if you realize that it's

1122.08 --> 1128.02
actually just innocence in a way very

1125.77 --> 1130.3
carefully maintained by some people and

1128.02 --> 1132.7
others are just like going along with

1130.3 --> 1135.1299999999999
the hoard that it

1132.7 --> 1138.7
yeah it's that is a real thing that

1135.13 --> 1140.88
energy is real and that pulled me out of

1138.7 --> 1144.43
one of like when one of my worst

1140.88 --> 1147.94
nightmares you could say because I had

1144.43 --> 1150.19
like a just like I had a week ago and I

1147.94 --> 1154.18
felt really bad and then was before I

1150.19 --> 1155.02
had a Daily Show way before that and I

1154.18 --> 1157.0
just

1155.02 --> 1159.4
yeah the nightmares overcame me really

1157.0 --> 1161.83
badly to the point that I even I think

1159.4 --> 1164.98
that I started to hallucinate was very

1161.83 --> 1169.21
surreal like visually that that's like

1164.98 --> 1173.92
waking that's never happened really that

1169.21 --> 1176.26
I can remember or or rarely it was bad

1173.92 --> 1180.04
and then I was like oh [ __ ] everything's

1176.26 --> 1182.29
going wrong and I have to like seek that

1180.04 --> 1184.48
this is not no longer psychological this

1182.29 --> 1185.86
is becoming spiritual so I just went to

1184.48 --> 1189.58
that church and just said

1185.86 --> 1191.4399999999998
me like the darkness is overwhelming me

1189.58 --> 1193.9289999999999
and they just immediately kind of

1191.44 --> 1197.76
understood my language also at it

1193.929 --> 1201.45
because I do talk very spiritual and

1197.76 --> 1204.58
another Navy super new-agey atheist way

1201.45 --> 1206.8300000000002
so they got it and they did a lay on

1204.58 --> 1210.27
hands and that really like switched

1206.83 --> 1214.96
something at least temporarily and like

1210.27 --> 1217.9
closed off the the yet the unnerved part

1214.96 --> 1220.9
that was probably the more direct cause

1217.9 --> 1223.0300000000002
of the hallucination side effects that's

1220.9 --> 1226.8090000000002
like a physical effect that happened to

1223.03 --> 1229.4189999999999
click it was fascinating so yeah don't

1226.809 --> 1231.61
underestimate it it is really something

1229.419 --> 1234.2800000000002
it's not just a bunch of delusional

1231.61 --> 1236.4099999999999
people it's not true

1234.28 --> 1239.98
for sure I mean you know your mind is a

1236.41 --> 1241.21
battlefield in Nam you do that bad in I

1239.98 --> 1242.5
mean that's what's gonna come out of you

1241.21 --> 1244.8400000000001
you feel that good in that's what's

1242.5 --> 1247.179
gonna rule you you know so you got to be

1244.84 --> 1248.9189999999999
careful on what your the movies you're

1247.179 --> 1251.14
watching the music you're listening to

1248.919 --> 1254.38
you know anything like that I mean

1251.14 --> 1257.14
because it's it's a spiritual world

1254.38 --> 1259.69
spiritual battle and it's up to you to

1257.14 --> 1262.48
decide what you're gonna allow to run

1259.69 --> 1267.3700000000001
your life you know so whatever you let

1262.48 --> 1270.22
in is what's gonna come out right yeah

1267.37 --> 1274.27
and I let them in and I I've been with

1270.22 --> 1278.919
them like every week for a year and then

1274.27 --> 1280.57
it was like okay I can cured and then I

1278.919 --> 1283.1200000000001
started to get kind of annoyed by

1280.57 --> 1284.6789999999999
typical cultural details that in the

1283.12 --> 1289.1999999999998
past even I've always annoyed me it's

1284.679 --> 1292.1200000000001
just a difference in taste and like yeah

1289.2 --> 1295.3300000000002
but I'm still like I still consider

1292.12 --> 1298.6899999999998
these people as friends and I always

1295.33 --> 1300.9099999999999
know that I'm welcome to just get step

1298.69 --> 1302.74
back in if I if I needed to for whatever

1300.91 --> 1305.41
reason over area if I just wanted to

1302.74 --> 1309.97
talk to these people and yeah it's right

1305.41 --> 1312.49
next to me so that also helps yeah you

1309.97 --> 1314.41
didn't read yourself I mean I don't like

1312.49 --> 1317.26
that's one thing like this flat whole

1314.41 --> 1318.1490000000001
flat or thing wakes you up too I mean

1317.26 --> 1320.489
you

1318.149 --> 1322.1889999999999
to know anything to do it for yourself

1320.489 --> 1324.539
you have to research it for yourself I

1322.189 --> 1326.8490000000002
mean I don't believe anything anyone

1324.539 --> 1328.679
tells me anymore but I mean you can tell

1326.849 --> 1329.789
me it's raining outside I'm gonna go

1328.679 --> 1332.279
look out the window before I'm gonna

1329.789 --> 1335.579
believe you because I just refuse to be

1332.279 --> 1337.769
light to any more openly well but

1335.579 --> 1340.019
there's no need really to assume that

1337.769 --> 1341.789
everyone is lying to you it all depends

1340.019 --> 1343.469
on the weight of the consequences of

1341.789 --> 1347.009
your acceptance of what they're saying

1343.469 --> 1349.8590000000002
you know and if they're pathologically

1347.009 --> 1352.169
lying about nonsensical things like that

1349.859 --> 1354.029
then that will review itself very

1352.169 --> 1358.0790000000002
quickly like for example with Trish

1354.029 --> 1359.909
Blyden don't worry don't worry I'm

1358.079 --> 1362.099
saying just don't worry you know don't

1359.909 --> 1365.3990000000001
worry about the lies they will reveal

1362.099 --> 1369.299
themselves don't be in fear constantly

1365.399 --> 1369.809
of being light it's not that I didn't

1369.299 --> 1373.439
say that

1369.809 --> 1376.1689999999999
very well all right so what I mean is no

1373.439 --> 1377.8490000000002
what I mean is like gum the people who

1376.169 --> 1380.5490000000002
told you when the Easter Bunny Santa

1377.849 --> 1382.829
Claus the spinning ball they didn't

1380.549 --> 1383.999
think they were lying you know they

1382.829 --> 1386.039
thought they were telling you the truth

1383.999 --> 1387.959
so I guess it what I'm saying is no

1386.039 --> 1390.779
matter what I always look to make sure

1387.959 --> 1393.269
for truths not because I'm worried or

1390.779 --> 1393.629
you know everything's on my mind bugging

1393.269 --> 1395.219
me

1393.629 --> 1397.589
they're just I ain't gonna be

1395.219 --> 1399.989
bullshitting no more okay I just it's

1397.589 --> 1402.539
just amazing it relies we've been taught

1399.989 --> 1405.599
the indoctrination well yeah the

1402.539 --> 1409.799
bullshitting is kind of a has become a

1405.599 --> 1413.029
cultural thing that is true but I still

1409.799 --> 1416.479
see it as that most people are just

1413.029 --> 1419.099
mistaken and they're so used to

1416.479 --> 1422.429
defending things without completely

1419.099 --> 1425.9389999999999
understanding them or just getting away

1422.429 --> 1427.6190000000001
with say like yeah I understand this and

1425.939 --> 1429.719
people then let you get away with that

1427.619 --> 1432.509
because that's normalized and people

1429.719 --> 1434.009
kind of want somebody who claims that so

1432.509 --> 1435.809
they don't have to think about they can

1434.009 --> 1437.579
then rely on them it's just like

1435.809 --> 1443.129
laziness intellectual laziness and

1437.579 --> 1444.6589999999999
that's so normalized now that yeah you

1443.129 --> 1446.4589999999998
actually they've done a spinning ball

1444.659 --> 1449.3690000000001
flying through space right but it is a

1446.459 --> 1452.04
mistake they're all mistakes that's how

1449.369 --> 1455.8799999999999
I see it and people

1452.04 --> 1458.31
rarely lie knowingly because there's so

1455.88 --> 1461.25
much more punishing to do that exactly

1458.31 --> 1463.59
you have people only really lie for what

1461.25 --> 1466.14
they think is a very critical reason

1463.59 --> 1472.35
that could be very selfish it could also

1466.14 --> 1474.3000000000002
be unselfish or just you know missing

1472.35 --> 1476.1899999999998
right and I'm not saying if they're like

1474.3 --> 1479.52
lying to me on purpose

1476.19 --> 1481.95
my guess my point is is you know we've

1479.52 --> 1484.53
been like to our whole lives with all

1481.95 --> 1485.94
being known that we're being liked where

1484.53 --> 1488.46
the people didn't know they were lying

1485.94 --> 1491.04
to us yeah the problem cautious about

1488.46 --> 1493.05
you know this you know obviously I'm

1491.04 --> 1495.6299999999999
working deeper things the problem is to

1493.05 --> 1499.8
focus the problem is that the focus lies

1495.63 --> 1502.8600000000001
on the model on the on the Legos and not

1499.8 --> 1504.93
on the persons approach to information

1502.86 --> 1507.6299999999999
because that is the fundamental problem

1504.93 --> 1511.3500000000001
in general that's how we've been wrongly

1507.63 --> 1514.44
conditioned to deal with information to

1511.35 --> 1518.61
memorize accepts don't critically think

1514.44 --> 1524.1000000000001
don't try to figure it out you know

1518.61 --> 1526.32
don't keep asking why too much that's

1524.1 --> 1531.24
what they try to do and that is really

1526.32 --> 1533.1299999999999
our main task is not so much even well

1531.24 --> 1535.26
it may become eventually you know when

1533.13 --> 1537.5100000000002
Flat Earth has become kind of like so

1535.26 --> 1539.85
widespread that like everybody's heard

1537.51 --> 1543.48
about it it's more a task than to help

1539.85 --> 1547.28
people figure out that their entire

1543.48 --> 1549.72
approach to the situation has been wrong

1547.28 --> 1552.09
dad I'd say what that day's coming soon

1549.72 --> 1555.0
do it cuz I mean this latter thing is

1552.09 --> 1558.27
getting I mean but saturated is

1555.0 --> 1560.22
everywhere this but I'd say what I

1558.27 --> 1563.06
looking at that moon yesterday I mean it

1560.22 --> 1565.71
was you know he finally had a decent day

1563.06 --> 1568.86
and it was prior owned I don't know four

1565.71 --> 1570.0900000000001
or five o'clock in the afternoon it's I

1568.86 --> 1572.1599999999999
think it was like just a sliver of a

1570.09 --> 1573.09
moon quarter moon or whatever but I tell

1572.16 --> 1575.76
you what that thing didn't even look

1573.09 --> 1578.07
like it was as high as the clouds

1575.76 --> 1579.36
I mean it's this I still can't figure

1578.07 --> 1580.77
out there I shouldn't say figure to

1579.36 --> 1584.8799999999999
understand why we can't get that

1580.77 --> 1587.43
distance to that thing and then all the

1584.88 --> 1591.63
distance probably changes dependent

1587.43 --> 1593.91
Portland's coming out of really yeah but

1591.63 --> 1597.63
how do you know there's a distance how

1593.91 --> 1599.01
do you know it's not just a parents well

1597.63 --> 1600.5100000000002
I mean it's a distance I mean me and you

1599.01 --> 1604.59
are you saying that dividend can see

1600.51 --> 1606.21
you'll see my heat but I'm just

1604.59 --> 1611.1899999999998
wondering like do you really think that

1606.21 --> 1613.41
it is physical then well I mean it's a

1611.19 --> 1615.3
light of some sort yeah that's okay

1613.41 --> 1618.42
object so I don't know but you better

1615.3 --> 1621.87
it's only what a light object that's

1618.42 --> 1627.0900000000001
kind of a contradiction it's light or

1621.87 --> 1628.86
it's an object which one is it it's the

1627.09 --> 1632.1899999999998
lesser light to the do he made two great

1628.86 --> 1635.85
lights light yeah so has it ever been

1632.19 --> 1639.96
addressed as an an object well then okay

1635.85 --> 1644.9399999999998
it's a light but it's a light that's in

1639.96 --> 1646.65
the air or in the sky right and we can

1644.94 --> 1647.88
see it so it has to be a distance from

1646.65 --> 1653.19
where we are

1647.88 --> 1656.5700000000002
why is we mean why it's a light why does

1653.19 --> 1656.5700000000002
there have to be a distance to it

1658.67 --> 1665.13
because it is just light so it gets

1661.26 --> 1669.6
further away no no but doesn't increase

1665.13 --> 1673.2
and decrease in light when it goes away

1669.6 --> 1677.1599999999999
there's well there's more atmosphere in

1673.2 --> 1680.1000000000001
between the distance the edge of vision

1677.16 --> 1681.99
where you see it and your yeah and your

1680.1 --> 1683.6999999999998
hot right above you so there is an

1681.99 --> 1686.79
effect like that there's more matter

1683.7 --> 1690.21
more gas to go through and all that but

1686.79 --> 1692.55
there's no proximity yeah that would

1690.21 --> 1695.73
warrant a little location from which

1692.55 --> 1698.22
light is coming because then you'd have

1695.73 --> 1700.2
proximity effects when something comes

1698.22 --> 1704.8500000000001
closer there's a lot more energy output

1700.2 --> 1706.3500000000001
and it goes away it decreases the latest

1704.85 --> 1706.8799999999999
consolidated the size of that moon is

1706.35 --> 1709.82
always

1706.88 --> 1712.0100000000002
the same the the portion that's lit

1709.82 --> 1714.1399999999999
changes but the size of it does not I

1712.01 --> 1716.69
mean you can't say that it's not a

1714.14 --> 1719.66
distance away from us yeah you can

1716.69 --> 1723.89
because the distance the requires

1719.66 --> 1726.92
proximity it that's kind of it a

1723.89 --> 1729.1100000000001
distance means it's a physical spatial

1726.92 --> 1730.49
thing so if there is a distance then

1729.11 --> 1732.53
there has to be literally something

1730.49 --> 1735.14
there but I'm pretty sure that if

1732.53 --> 1737.57
somehow you could instantly teleport to

1735.14 --> 1739.25
that apparent location where you size up

1737.57 --> 1741.86
the moon to be from your current

1739.25 --> 1745.22
location that it would be just as far

1741.86 --> 1746.24
away in another spot because it is not

1745.22 --> 1748.3700000000001
at any distance

1746.24 --> 1750.94
it's an apparent distance it's like a

1748.37 --> 1756.08
hologram moves with you like a rainbow

1750.94 --> 1758.39
like the horizon yeah more like a

1756.08 --> 1761.05
rainbow it is an optical effect the

1758.39 --> 1767.51
horizon is an optical distortion of

1761.05 --> 1770.08
material view the Mirage is beyond

1767.51 --> 1770.08
horizon

1771.61 --> 1777.25
okay heads are you still following sorry

1774.61 --> 1779.9399999999998
it's just didn't really expect a

1777.25 --> 1783.79
dacovian to be going in this direction

1779.94 --> 1786.1200000000001
me either but anyways I put it like this

1783.79 --> 1788.32
if we just see we could have went to it

1786.12 --> 1789.79
yesterday afternoon and I could have

1788.32 --> 1791.4399999999998
stood on it

1789.79 --> 1792.73
yeah well it was close enough to where

1791.44 --> 1795.73
you still want to see the curvature of

1792.73 --> 1797.68
the earth you know nothing that's a

1795.73 --> 1802.03
that's a terrible thing to say that's

1797.68 --> 1806.26
very ball dish of you since there's no

1802.03 --> 1810.36
curve obviously but I mean it just

1806.26 --> 1810.36
appears to be that long and that close

1812.83 --> 1818.4099999999999
right well appearances are deceiving

1816.04 --> 1829.09
because yeah if you move it moves with

1818.41 --> 1831.43
you yes it's deep it's weird how it

1829.09 --> 1834.9399999999998
works I don't know why it white the

1831.43 --> 1837.3600000000001
light manifests like that but it just

1834.94 --> 1843.66
seems that it's nonlocalized it just

1837.36 --> 1846.34
manifests within within visual did ya

1843.66 --> 1852.52
just happens cameras pick it up humans

1846.34 --> 1854.32
pick it up I wonder I think infrared

1852.52 --> 1858.25
even picks it up that makes it even

1854.32 --> 1862.27
weirder have you ever done that test

1858.25 --> 1865.93
where um attack at a little gauge call

1862.27 --> 1869.1399999999999
where you can measure the heat in the

1865.93 --> 1870.5800000000002
light or the shade mm-hmm I ever done

1869.14 --> 1872.8000000000002
that test yourself we've done that yeah

1870.58 --> 1875.6499999999999
I've done that but it's a long time ago

1872.8 --> 1877.3
or well long like 10 years ago and

1875.65 --> 1879.19
there's a difference it's not as I've

1877.3 --> 1880.51
seen some results for it they make it

1879.19 --> 1882.49
like an art sergeant and some others

1880.51 --> 1884.5
having a huge distant you know

1882.49 --> 1886.39
temperature difference now we only were

1884.5 --> 1889.9
in a within a couple different degrees

1886.39 --> 1892.42
or the light to the Sun was cooler you

1889.9 --> 1894.4
know than the shade you know so I mean

1892.42 --> 1896.2
I've never seen a huge drastic

1894.4 --> 1897.52
temperature change but I mean there was

1896.2 --> 1899.71
temperature change within a few degrees

1897.52 --> 1901.27
I mean in everywhere everywhere we

1899.71 --> 1905.56
tested it wasn't just like in one spot

1901.27 --> 1907.65
you know we were doing it all over you

1905.56 --> 1907.6499999999999
know

1908.659 --> 1916.2
so mean that's in this interesting you

1911.039 --> 1919.53
know yet they for me the moon

1916.2 --> 1925.2
temperature like that is I tested it and

1919.53 --> 1926.039
it was pretty clear yeah the plane is

1925.2 --> 1930.659
cooler

1926.039 --> 1933.84
all right or whatever yeah is the light

1930.659 --> 1937.8200000000002
cooler the interaction of that light

1933.84 --> 1941.1
with the matter seems to cool down so

1937.82 --> 1943.4399999999998
whether it is the light there's a

1941.1 --> 1946.08
process going on as a result of the

1943.44 --> 1948.929
moonlight hitting things that does

1946.08 --> 1951.0
increase cooling down now how that

1948.929 --> 1954.3200000000002
transpired I don't exactly understand

1951.0 --> 1957.51
but it seems to just work like that

1954.32 --> 1959.85
right if you want to see how the moon

1957.51 --> 1961.98
gets its light and it goes through its

1959.85 --> 1964.08
phases again that's in the book Enoch

1961.98 --> 1964.559
would be the best 10 15 bucks you ever

1964.08 --> 1971.82
spent

1964.559 --> 1973.3799999999999
alright it's here so not the good

1971.82 --> 1974.789
servant who I like that guy you ease

1973.38 --> 1976.94
comes up with some nice comments and

1974.789 --> 1985.289
stuff in here yeah he's great

1976.94 --> 1989.3700000000001
Amanda too in everybody even Lori's got

1985.289 --> 1991.799
to get someone a hard time all day yeah

1989.37 --> 1995.0
but I got a I'm gonna run Arwen no I'll

1991.799 --> 1998.429
stay in but I gotta get off mic here so

1995.0 --> 2002.0
alright yeah you're at work right yeah I

1998.429 --> 2003.8300000000002
run a business so okay that's fine hey

2002.0 --> 2006.409
thanks for being on the on the show man

2003.83 --> 2007.8799999999999
it's been interesting yeah no thanks for

2006.409 --> 2012.8200000000002
having me again we'll talk soon all

2007.88 --> 2012.8200000000002
right later guys later

2020.38 --> 2026.0500000000002
hmm all right yeah that was interesting

2031.529 --> 2040.779
I'm thinking all right oh by the way did

2038.23 --> 2044.82
anyone any of you catch your auntie's

2040.779 --> 2044.82
yesterday that was hilarious

2046.679 --> 2055.9900000000002
yeah he actually just full heartedly

2049.54 --> 2060.46
declared that gravity is is a force

2055.99 --> 2064.0299999999997
field that contains the atmosphere of

2060.46 --> 2066.94
the globe earth like a closed bottle of

2064.03 --> 2071.71
like a glass bottle yeah he pretty much

2066.94 --> 2073.329
went there and then double down on every

2071.71 --> 2077.379
other silly assertion he ever made

2073.329 --> 2083.79
before that including that he never self

2077.379 --> 2087.3689999999997
contradicts it was pretty interesting

2083.79 --> 2090.19
and eventually just started like

2087.369 --> 2094.569
permanently rumbling everything non-stop

2090.19 --> 2097.349
even ranty just completely over I'm

2094.569 --> 2097.349
pausing the panel

2110.28 --> 2115.2000000000003
yeah thanks for being on the panel again

2112.56 --> 2123.86
Tom Parker sorry if I maybe was maybe a

2115.2 --> 2123.8599999999997
little rough strict or something

2126.369 --> 2134.65
but yeah the moon is a tough concept and

2129.599 --> 2137.17
again physicality assumption bias is is

2134.65 --> 2143.559
rampant for everyone it's probably the

2137.17 --> 2146.829
root cause of lunacy oh well thanks

2143.559 --> 2149.849
Karen be well I'll check that out that's

2146.829 --> 2149.849
that's nice

2157.41 --> 2162.739
I'll bet use that hundred ninety pages

2161.2 --> 2164.009
[Music]

2162.739 --> 2173.2690000000002
hmm

2164.009 --> 2173.2690000000002
okay thanks I'll store that uh uh yeah

2304.17 --> 2314.5
right sorry I was muted now yeah Dusty's

2309.33 --> 2318.13
Flint gravels porn if I could get a

2314.5 --> 2322.27
witch or amazing to interview well

2318.13 --> 2324.58
that's yeah I'm not gonna do that I'm

2322.27 --> 2326.8
not gonna look out for one but if I just

2324.58 --> 2329.37
happen to bump into one then I might

2326.8 --> 2329.3700000000003
consider it

2356.46 --> 2361.8
yeah yeah concerning rumpus John Watson

2359.67 --> 2365.2200000000003
I've been figuring out there's something

2361.8 --> 2367.59
that could still be done with it but I

2365.22 --> 2370.5899999999997
don't know it's just very experimental

2367.59 --> 2375.6000000000004
idea but I think that maybe if you could

2370.59 --> 2379.53
just let him do his thing and like sort

2375.6 --> 2384.0
of give it him and then specifically

2379.53 --> 2387.32
start to analyze how he misinterpreted

2384.0 --> 2390.6
and Miss connected the things afterward

2387.32 --> 2393.9300000000003
with great detail just literally like

2390.6 --> 2397.08
the the process of constructing the

2393.93 --> 2401.0699999999997
machination within the explanation as it

2397.08 --> 2403.3199999999997
went and then just do that like without

2401.07 --> 2406.6200000000003
hostility I think that may have

2403.32 --> 2411.3
interesting influences you might even

2406.62 --> 2413.5499999999997
like just just say oh yeah yeah that

2411.3 --> 2414.8700000000003
seems correct this is something like

2413.55 --> 2416.94
that he you never really know what's

2414.87 --> 2427.8599999999997
gonna happen but I might try that at

2416.94 --> 2431.07
some point but yeah usually when you

2427.86 --> 2432.7200000000003
invite rumpus it always ends up in rum

2431.07 --> 2436.1000000000004
passing there's just no way around it

2432.72 --> 2436.1
rumpus will be rumpus

2463.45 --> 2468.6299999999997
Ariely be yeah that was an interesting

2465.7 --> 2468.6299999999997
stream earlier

2496.32 --> 2499.04
Wow

2501.239 --> 2511.229
700 miles of planes that's a lot that's

2505.359 --> 2511.229
a lot of land dates 60s RMC

2547.78 --> 2557.44
laughs yeah right but distracted here

2566.86 --> 2573.9300000000003
Wow okay Jeffrey bill I have no idea

2571.15 --> 2573.9300000000003
what you're talking about

2574.56 --> 2582.22
puppet you mean pillars right

2579.06 --> 2586.38
the granite pillars you being batteries

2582.22 --> 2586.3799999999997
yeah well that could be

2591.71 --> 2594.91
wouldn't be surprised

2607.83 --> 2610.949
[Music]

2620.48 --> 2630.29
you got a point there baits 6 erm see

2624.369 --> 2634.9
yeah without the ballers I think we

2630.29 --> 2634.9
would not have so many great laughs

2639.48 --> 2643.58
no Jeffrey bailed that's just you

2665.46 --> 2668.119
yeah

2668.52 --> 2671.09
what

2684.589 --> 2691.029
what I don't even know what are you

2688.13 --> 2691.029
seeing pillars

2703.24 --> 2712.81
oh wait what okay that is very weird

2709.15 --> 2716.14
when I googled the word and then clicked

2712.81 --> 2722.32
images yeah I'm completely swamped with

2716.14 --> 2726.609
pictures of batteries but I don't

2722.32 --> 2729.69
understand the root of that word is that

2726.609 --> 2729.69
Spanish or something

2781.02 --> 2787.35
now look there is sound I'm just having

2785.01 --> 2788.9700000000003
a couple of silent moments as well so

2787.35 --> 2792.23
that may be a little confusing sorry

2788.97 --> 2796.3799999999997
about that just a bit distracted by this

2792.23 --> 2801.68
pls I don't know why why you would

2796.38 --> 2801.6800000000003
choose that non English word

2805.49 --> 2811.1
pylons i know and pillars

2846.939 --> 2849.939
mmm

2856.93 --> 2863.7999999999997
yeah well when they looking for a pylon

2859.6 --> 2867.36
as a definition it seems to be referring

2863.8 --> 2867.36
mostly to architecture

2880.26 --> 2884.03
yeah I I know

2906.14 --> 2913.94
it seems to be described mostly as a a

2909.94 --> 2917.4500000000003
support tower for us steel tower for

2913.94 --> 2921.71
structures like bridges or something

2917.45 --> 2925.1
that suspends things that is what a

2921.71 --> 2929.0
pylon seems to be defined as primarily

2925.1 --> 2931.31
so I don't see the connections with

2929.0 --> 2933.97
batteries although yeah see a lot of

2931.31 --> 2933.97
power wires

2943.64 --> 2949.939
all right

2944.97 --> 2949.939
[Music]

2955.5 --> 2961.219
[Music]

2970.72 --> 2975.4599999999996
okay

2972.91 --> 2977.769
I wouldn't be surprised about that that

2975.46 --> 2981.509
they like open collection batteries that

2977.769 --> 2987.339
would gather frequencies of energy

2981.509 --> 2997.859
atmospheric electricity yeah like the is

2987.339 --> 2997.859
it the tesla era as it were

3000.68 --> 3007.71
they're really kind of using that i

3002.91 --> 3012.5
think but that was before the electric

3007.71 --> 3012.5
company revolution system really set in

3038.16 --> 3042.3489999999997
okay fine

3087.88 --> 3094.54
or gonna keep boxes or crystal batteries

3092.31 --> 3097.39
it's just how I see it

3094.54 --> 3100.23
like crystal batteries crystals collect

3097.39 --> 3100.23
energy

3120.579 --> 3123.3900000000003
hmm

3146.49 --> 3154.25
what what are you saying it's a weird

3149.97 --> 3154.25
thing to say dusty Flint gravel scorn

3171.96 --> 3176.01
living stone carving

3192.45 --> 3195.52
[Music]

3204.11 --> 3211.36
okay so I guess Jeffrey Bell is

3207.38 --> 3211.36
fascinated by the word pillow

3229.69 --> 3232.23
who

3258.41 --> 3271.089
petrified wood huh

3262.269 --> 3271.089
fascinating I Wow

3273.97 --> 3278.95
that kind of blew my mind there for a

3276.55 --> 3281.8590000000004
bit because yeah I do know things can be

3278.95 --> 3285.16
petrified really rapidly these certain

3281.859 --> 3291.48
water conditions so that would mean that

3285.16 --> 3296.29
a building parts of it would be

3291.48 --> 3299.02
basically wood plate put in place carved

3296.29 --> 3302.5299999999997
out in detail and then the whole

3299.02 --> 3305.2599999999998
building would be flooded and closed off

3302.53 --> 3307.63
with the with the certain chemicals for

3305.26 --> 3309.9100000000003
it all to petrify rapidly is that what

3307.63 --> 3315.63
you're suggesting because that is

3309.91 --> 3315.6299999999997
fascinating that is really interesting

3335.88 --> 3348.1800000000003
what mark colored what the hell that's

3344.489 --> 3348.18
doesn't make any sense

3360.33 --> 3364.74
I'm pretty sure that when there's

3362.16 --> 3367.19
petrification going on it is within

3364.74 --> 3367.1899999999996
water

3382.61 --> 3395.06
sand patent no gleam that's not

3386.56 --> 3397.15
petrified it's fused it's molten you

3395.06 --> 3397.15
know

3404.46 --> 3411.77
this is not petrified it's molten

3408.77 --> 3411.77
crystallized

3437.869 --> 3445.339
well look I do know or I have suspicions

3441.589 --> 3449.68
that high intensity electricity also has

3445.339 --> 3453.65
substance altering effects so it might

3449.68 --> 3455.839
know is it transmute parts of the

3453.65 --> 3457.789
material I already even yeah talked

3455.839 --> 3460.279
about that a few shows ago so I'm not

3457.789 --> 3466.67
denying that but that doesn't make that

3460.279 --> 3470.63
process petrification the look if you

3466.67 --> 3472.489
can demonstrate like some you know some

3470.63 --> 3474.619
kind of organic material wood or

3472.489 --> 3478.099
whatever in some set up being hit by

3474.619 --> 3480.079
lightning and it turning into stone be

3478.099 --> 3481.759
my guest and demonstrate that because

3480.079 --> 3484.819
I've never heard of that

3481.759 --> 3488.119
I have heard of relatively rapid

3484.819 --> 3494.589
petrification in water I think I had to

3488.119 --> 3498.309
do with by depriving it from from oxygen

3494.589 --> 3498.3089999999997
or something else

3503.17 --> 3510.57
okay all right I'll take a look Oh

3514.62 --> 3517.62
Thunderbolts

3523.24 --> 3527.6699999999996
yes what fossils

3533.77 --> 3540.58
all right well I think that the

3536.32 --> 3543.1000000000004
fossilization did happen like that the

3540.58 --> 3546.25
fossils were I've even said that before

3543.1 --> 3548.31
I think that the flood happened and like

3546.25 --> 3551.53
a big mouse drum of mud and water

3548.31 --> 3554.02
everything eventually settled and then

3551.53 --> 3556.869
maybe there was some shaking going on as

3554.02 --> 3560.23
well and then the vibration of it would

3556.869 --> 3562.51
cause yeah a certain arrangement of

3560.23 --> 3570.19
densities within the mud layer and then

3562.51 --> 3572.53
it would petrify relatively quickly and

3570.19 --> 3575.11
that would make sense with how the

3572.53 --> 3577.869
things are found in their condition

3575.11 --> 3582.9300000000003
arranged like with several locations

3577.869 --> 3582.9300000000003
that have trees upside down petrified

3584.1 --> 3588.45
that's how I thought it happened but

3588.69 --> 3597.43
yeah that was that really what we're

3593.74 --> 3599.77
talking about I just want to see this

3597.43 --> 3603.1499999999996
idea that electricity is supposed to be

3599.77 --> 3603.15
causing this petrification

3609.0 --> 3616.89
oh really preacher Mungo talks about it

3612.51 --> 3619.849
does he actually show that stare at

3616.89 --> 3619.8489999999997
before picture

3626.86 --> 3629.88
what is that

3634.12 --> 3641.5899999999997
right when the ground turns to glass

3636.81 --> 3646.36
yeah that's molten glass it's molten

3641.59 --> 3650.05
it's fused it's not petrified it's not

3646.36 --> 3652.8
petrification all those things may get

3650.05 --> 3652.8
caught up in it

3664.15 --> 3671.5
yeah

3666.25 --> 3675.7
it's oh my god it says the shape left

3671.5 --> 3679.39
behind looks like a miniature petrified

3675.7 --> 3682.5699999999997
lightning shape so yeah look like that

3679.39 --> 3684.7
doesn't mean it is petrified it's yeah

3682.57 --> 3688.5
it kind of reminds them if lightning

3684.7 --> 3693.27
subtly became solid it's not literally

3688.5 --> 3693.27
the process of petrification there

3715.92 --> 3719.569
this is really silly

3720.93 --> 3727.89
now but I've looked for the video I've

3723.63 --> 3730.32
looked for the links no this is some

3727.89 --> 3734.22
kind of stupid rumor about petrification

3730.32 --> 3739.32
caused by lightning it's not it doesn't

3734.22 --> 3742.0499999999997
even say that clean your photo of

3739.32 --> 3745.82
samples doesn't say it's petrified it

3742.05 --> 3750.3500000000004
just looks like it's petrified lightning

3745.82 --> 3750.3500000000004
the series

3771.47 --> 3778.7
Oh Dave Ricky look but that's not even

3774.5 --> 3783.05
my point I know I know I already said I

3778.7 --> 3784.97
think that petrification happened

3783.05 --> 3787.9700000000003
relatively quickly after the flood and

3784.97 --> 3790.31
how things would settle pretty full

3787.97 --> 3793.4599999999996
description as to even the placements of

3790.31 --> 3797.06
the layers and the orientation of the

3793.46 --> 3800.87
objects trees animals getting caught in

3797.06 --> 3801.59
it as quickly absolutely I have no doubt

3800.87 --> 3805.49
about that

3801.59 --> 3808.25
but this idea that lightning causes

3805.49 --> 3809.99
petrification that seems to be a pretty

3808.25 --> 3812.72
ridiculous rumor that's now being

3809.99 --> 3817.0
inserted because every link that I look

3812.72 --> 3817.0
at doesn't support that at all

3823.2 --> 3830.3799999999997
yeah mark coloureds I don't really give

3826.54 --> 3833.08
a [ __ ] who talks about something I'd

3830.38 --> 3836.4900000000002
like to see actual back up because it

3833.08 --> 3836.49
sounds like rumours to me

3853.02 --> 3859.68
did he show no more colored come on did

3856.26 --> 3863.19
he show photographs in the presentation

3859.68 --> 3865.9199999999996
off that tree because the only thing

3863.19 --> 3868.94
that I saw was just a bunch of chocolate

3865.92 --> 3874.19
what is it fossil things like those

3868.94 --> 3877.02
octopi with the with the snail shell and

3874.19 --> 3883.19
yeah it's just about petrified old

3877.02 --> 3883.19
animals yeah

3885.24 --> 3888.33
[Music]

3899.34 --> 3903.77
what that's that

3925.079 --> 3932.619
yeah thanks for that clean even that

3928.089 --> 3935.349
last link says it's just the name they

3932.619 --> 3937.81
call it petrified lightning it isn't

3935.349 --> 3940.3590000000004
it's described when a ball of lightning

3937.81 --> 3945.43
strikes a sandy surface the electricity

3940.359 --> 3947.7999999999997
can melt the sand the melted substance

3945.43 --> 3950.74
combined with other materials then it

3947.8 --> 3955.6800000000003
hardens into a lump of glass called

3950.74 --> 3960.069
Fujita fooled your rights it's not

3955.68 --> 3964.5989999999997
petrification they gave it petrified as

3960.069 --> 3976.75
a name because of the descriptive nature

3964.599 --> 3983.4
of it come on now melting is not

3976.75 --> 3983.4
petrification clean or incorrect

3992.5 --> 3995.699
[Music]

3999.2 --> 4002.62
[Music]

4029.69 --> 4040.4700000000003
so yeah anyway I'm gonna round out the

4032.13 --> 4043.5
show yeah yeah but clean you seem to be

4040.47 --> 4047.58
overlooking that petrified liking

4043.5 --> 4050.79
lightning is the designated name for the

4047.58 --> 4053.37
phenomena it's not literal it has

4050.79 --> 4057.12
nothing to do with the petrification the

4053.37 --> 4059.31
process known as petrification and all

4057.12 --> 4064.46
of the links you put out in the video

4059.31 --> 4067.74
none of it backed up that it is

4064.46 --> 4070.05
literally petrified it's just a

4067.74 --> 4073.1699999999996
descriptor it's the name they gave to it

4070.05 --> 4074.69
that's that's all still interesting

4073.17 --> 4077.28
though you know that that happens but

4074.69 --> 4080.82
but yeah anyway I'm gonna round out the

4077.28 --> 4083.4
show cuz it's already started up to get

4080.82 --> 4087.51
some groceries so thanks everyone for

4083.4 --> 4090.42
coming I hope you like to show it yeah

4087.51 --> 4094.0200000000004
was a bit silent part of it Tom Parker

4090.42 --> 4096.93
of course the first half so that was

4094.02 --> 4098.67
nice yeah if you like the show please

4096.93 --> 4100.049
don't forget to upload it and if you

4098.67 --> 4101.9400000000005
haven't already subscribed to my channel

do consider because gotta get by somehow

4117.63 --> 4123.359
and yeah I will be back tomorrow the

4122.94 --> 4128.04
flat earth

4123.359 --> 4130.29
early bird number 378 and I'm gonna join

4128.04 --> 4133.74
the Flat Earth debates hashtag meifa of

4130.29 --> 4136.37
course indeed until the next video keep

4133.74 --> 4136.37
