do decide to get a car song you don't

169.95 --> 174.41
show up now I don't think you show up

174.89 --> 187.10999999999999
tough luck hmm so yeah guys you might

182.7 --> 189.51
have noticed that for this evening it's

187.11 --> 193.98000000000002
a flat earth night owl

189.51 --> 197.25
I haven't properly yeah set it up yet

193.98 --> 199.85899999999998
but I already made something so you can

197.25 --> 203.16
see there's something gonna happen it's

199.859 --> 206.70000000000002
gonna be arena thumb basically or I hope

203.16 --> 209.579
it's gonna be I have no idea of how

206.7 --> 212.36999999999998
successful this will be I I have good

209.579 --> 216.39000000000001
hopes on one end on the other hand yeah

212.37 --> 218.13
that I already had some questions for

216.39 --> 219.69
example from Riley who was just being

218.13 --> 221.91
very honest and pragmatic and I

219.69 --> 223.859
appreciate about it and I already

221.91 --> 227.85
addressed it yesterday as well and that

223.859 --> 229.859
is like unlike Randy I don't have a lot

227.85 --> 234.84
really to present for it and Randy

229.859 --> 238.53
worked for everything so that I don't

234.84 --> 241.41
know if it's gonna work out or that in a

238.53 --> 243.6
weird twist if this is not gonna work

241.41 --> 246.56
out this evening and I have no idea if

243.6 --> 249.959
it would it would bum me out

246.56 --> 252.989
but it's not gonna stop me so maybe if

249.959 --> 256.019
it's not gonna work out I will ask Jose

252.989 --> 258.269
if you might consider sending me that

256.019 --> 260.609
camera went that I declined before after

258.269 --> 264.09000000000003
all so I could just do some stuff with

260.609 --> 266.88899999999995
that and then use that

264.09 --> 273.23999999999995
to show what I can do in a second

266.889 --> 273.24
attempt I don't know just planning ahead

273.719 --> 281.53
but yeah whatever I got now it's not

276.4 --> 285.48999999999995
gonna work out oh my cameras are total

281.53 --> 289.05999999999995
crap either the batteries don't last

285.49 --> 291.009
longer than half an hour or my memory is

289.06 --> 294.849
so crappy I can take like one picture

291.009 --> 297.47900000000004
and then it's full it's just I'm not

294.849 --> 302.259
properly equipped to make photographs

297.479 --> 305.11
unfortunately I can make webcam snaps so

302.259 --> 316.719
that that's about it so I'm confined to

305.11 --> 319.27000000000004
the computer in this room well peanuts

316.719 --> 319.84
Clark he literally offered to just give

319.27 --> 323.71
it to me

319.84 --> 327.039
send it they didn't need it back as far

323.71 --> 329.169
as I remember or said like yeah if

327.039 --> 331.259
you're then gonna get a bad better one

329.169 --> 335.81
then you give it to somebody else or I

331.259 --> 338.959
give it back I don't know we'll see oh

335.81 --> 338.959
[Music]

340.11 --> 350.37
sheesh oh my condolences x3 twenty

345.639 --> 353.789
thirty hear that I hope I hope you're

350.37 --> 353.789
dealing with it all right

358.93 --> 368.419
well just a guy yeah is it's all a

366.32 --> 371.3
matter of perspective do I deserve it as

368.419 --> 377.19899999999996
in net worth as in the money that I make

371.3 --> 379.43
or do I deserve it as in people with

377.199 --> 381.289
capability that could make great shots

379.43 --> 383.81
deserve cameras it's all a matter of

381.289 --> 387.5
perspective I know I can make great

383.81 --> 393.86
shots I'm very confident I have done

387.5 --> 397.76
photography before as I described the

393.86 --> 401.35
problem is now mostly is that most of

397.76 --> 405.169
the photographs that I did make are

401.35 --> 410.3
basically packed in boxes in storage in

405.169 --> 412.52
another city and I can't just readily go

410.3 --> 414.56
there to collect them and show them or

412.52 --> 418.82
something I have to like plan for that

414.56 --> 421.099
my dad and everything could do it but

418.82 --> 423.65
not for that this evening that's

421.099 --> 426.83
extremely unlikely to happen I just

423.65 --> 430.69899999999996
realized that yesterday that because of

426.83 --> 432.59
the short runs date that's gonna be

430.699 --> 434.63
difficult so I unfortunately don't have

432.59 --> 437.15
a lot of photographs to present I could

434.63 --> 440.12
show like we had be kind of weird but

437.15 --> 443.69
show like my old photographs of myself

440.12 --> 448.539
doing stuff with my older camera which

443.69 --> 448.539
is kind of better actually you know what

450.229 --> 458.33
that camera still works it's like my old

452.87 --> 460.279
phone and it maybe I could use that it

458.33 --> 463.34
still yeah the cap didn't there there's

460.279 --> 466.27
no phone connection but maybe I could

463.34 --> 466.27
use the camera

503.52 --> 514.75
right my old phone but that camera

511.15 --> 516.519
actually was pretty decent I made a lot

514.75 --> 520.599
of photographs with these and it could

516.519 --> 523.899
store like 80 which for me is a huge

520.599 --> 527.37
amount like I I'm not like the guy

523.899 --> 532.69
that's completely like no I'm like I

527.37 --> 536.829
want every picture to be perfect I might

532.69 --> 539.3800000000001
take a second or third picture but yeah

536.829 --> 541.2399999999999
I'm I didn't I'm a perfectionist but I I

539.38 --> 546.48
could try to just go around with this

541.24 --> 550.589
thing that's know will be interesting

546.48 --> 550.589
battery yeah

551.54 --> 557.51
I just I have to find a proper loader

554.03 --> 562.03
for it though it's a very weird specific

557.51 --> 562.03
type of thing I hope still have one

569.89 --> 576.75
oh right well in that case piss off

579.46 --> 583.009
[Music]

585.3 --> 592.93
because I kind of did and the freaking

589.75 --> 595.66
government took the money away again you

592.93 --> 599.649
know so yeah I've worked more work more

595.66 --> 604.6899999999999
oh oh like that that all works out yeah

599.649 --> 607.81
I'm sure it does yeah you know yeah of

604.69 --> 609.639
course I could just get a full-time

607.81 --> 613.3599999999999
career with studying everything and be

609.639 --> 616.449
totally Ram packed with that and you

613.36 --> 620.86
probably not see me again for at least

616.449 --> 623.41
half a year if that happens and I would

620.86 --> 625.6
have lost track completely and there's a

623.41 --> 628.449
big chance that I also and this is just

625.6 --> 630.6700000000001
realistic that it would be too much

628.449 --> 633.04
energy to muster getting back into it

630.67 --> 635.4399999999999
and I wouldn't want to let go of my job

633.04 --> 637.0
anymore because it is so convenient and

635.44 --> 639.25
I have a lot of energy I can actually

637.0 --> 642.279
apply after half a year if it would work

639.25 --> 648.55
out and it would be bye-bye Flat Earth

642.279 --> 652.149
really so I'm trying to be realistic

648.55 --> 656.1099999999999
about this because that kind of [ __ ]

652.149 --> 658.769
happened to me before if I drastically

656.11 --> 661.0600000000001
change what I do then I'll like

658.769 --> 664.87
completely suddenly lose interest in

661.06 --> 669.819
whatever I was doing before that even

664.87 --> 671.529
though I was very much into it so and I

669.819 --> 673.86
think there's still more for me to do

671.529 --> 673.86
here

679.71 --> 686.01
and yeah that I'd miss a lot of guys and

683.46 --> 695.0400000000001
gals here and like I've met so many

686.01 --> 696.63
people but it would almost it's like the

695.04 --> 703.17
same effect that happened with my old

696.63 --> 707.88
old friend circle you know that like I I

703.17 --> 710.5799999999999
lost I became too dissonant with that

707.88 --> 712.08
frequency because of my own development

710.58 --> 715.1700000000001
in that case not trying to compare you

712.08 --> 717.99
guys to that and that just subtly made

715.17 --> 722.3389999999999
it impossible for me to respect certain

717.99 --> 724.23
elements that they all shared and I just

722.339 --> 726.48
had an ax but it's very tough for me to

724.23 --> 729.48
let go friends too especially but yeah I

726.48 --> 735.0600000000001
was so leaning on them so heavily much

729.48 --> 737.1
more even than it was now but then yeah

735.06 --> 740.8499999999999
when I actually was able to kind of step

737.1 --> 743.64
away by accident because of like a bump

740.85 --> 748.13
in bad timing and [ __ ] like we were both

743.64 --> 748.13
having a bad time like

749.04 --> 755.699
my friends one of ya parent one of them

752.589 --> 760.36
died and it's quite tragic

755.699 --> 763.449
Sutton but I didn't know that but at the

760.36 --> 767.1990000000001
same time we were having issues just

763.449 --> 769.99
social dealing issues and yeah I had

767.199 --> 773.529
just like lost my car that time and that

769.99 --> 775.54
like so so that was just horrific to me

773.529 --> 778.329
because that was for me directly

775.54 --> 780.7489999999999
associated as like being my mother's car

778.329 --> 785.1099999999999
so it was very personal to me I had like

780.749 --> 787.4200000000001
it sounds so stupid but I was heard

785.11 --> 789.399
about it and they didn't even know and

787.42 --> 791.259
we just clashed and it was over

789.399 --> 793.569
bang and I was kind of done with it

791.259 --> 795.069
because literally yeah one of them was a

793.569 --> 798.3389999999999
SOI boy the other one was pretty much

795.069 --> 801.189
had weird social justice warrior evil

798.339 --> 802.1990000000001
tendencies and pro pedophilia and all

801.189 --> 809.86
that [ __ ]

802.199 --> 812.05
so if it didn't work anymore and now not

809.86 --> 816.339
comparing of course any of you guys to

812.05 --> 817.959
that but yeah being a flat earther and

816.339 --> 821.35
dealing with this it takes up a lot of

817.959 --> 824.4899999999999
focus you have to keep track in order to

821.35 --> 828.0690000000001
compete properly in order to have a

824.49 --> 832.24
really high tier conversation and figure

828.069 --> 835.689
out things and help enlighten things and

832.24 --> 838.99
if I had to switch away and really focus

835.689 --> 840.879
rerouting all my energies to get in kind

838.99 --> 842.889
of schedule thinking and more technical

840.879 --> 846.339
aspects that had nothing to do with any

842.889 --> 850.179
of this there's just a big chance that

846.339 --> 853.1790000000001
I'll just like it's the almost like fall

850.179 --> 856.99
out of love effect like because I'm away

853.179 --> 858.67
too long because there's no way that as

856.99 --> 861.369
long as I'm focused on that job that I'm

858.67 --> 865.42
still able to really muster the energy

861.369 --> 868.4490000000001
to even yeah get on YouTube anymore I

865.42 --> 871.439
just probably watch like a series and

868.449 --> 873.5
Netflix really like tired and that's it

871.439 --> 875.9599999999999
besides

873.5 --> 877.79
that new career thing because I would be

875.96 --> 879.89
totally obsessed with it because I had

877.79 --> 884.8299999999999
to in order to be able to focus on it

879.89 --> 887.33
properly it's just so yeah it's really

884.83 --> 891.47
sounds really complicated when I put it

887.33 --> 894.0200000000001
like that I know I could just like say

891.47 --> 897.74
okay you're you're sabotaging yourself

894.02 --> 899.72
with setting up this conceptualization

897.74 --> 905.35
of how it would go but it is based on my

899.72 --> 907.82
own experience so and I've tried it

905.35 --> 910.4
multiple times and he wouldn't work out

907.82 --> 913.85
because either I'd had like I'd had that

910.4 --> 920.12
kind of thing with flat earth before it

913.85 --> 920.9300000000001
it happened like in a way remember in

920.12 --> 923.3
the early day

920.93 --> 931.0999999999999
like a few years ago I had like a month

923.3 --> 933.5899999999999
a job at a and a as a call center

931.1 --> 938.03
basically I did have a job for a month

933.59 --> 939.88
like every day and I was into that and I

938.03 --> 942.89
really put a lot of energy in it I

939.88 --> 944.42
barely have was able to do anything

942.89 --> 947.24
during that time but that was during the

944.42 --> 950.39
the the when I was really into Flat

947.24 --> 952.25
Earth like you're when oh yeah marks

950.39 --> 955.79
mostly from following mark Sargent and

952.25 --> 958.97
Patricia back then Nathan hadn't really

955.79 --> 961.88
done any flat earth debate yet back then

958.97 --> 964.73
so was really into it and still kind of

961.88 --> 969.25
like in almost obsessed about it because

964.73 --> 969.25
it was like really raging out there and

970.51 --> 976.85
yeah people started in just in general

974.9 --> 979.01
conversation on the job would start

976.85 --> 981.25
talking about freaking satellites and

979.01 --> 981.25
[ __ ]

981.64 --> 988.75
and like yeah at some point especially

986.829 --> 990.4899999999999
if they start to get all braggy but oh

988.75 --> 993.31
I'm so smart that I know this [ __ ] you

990.49 --> 997.69
know it's like I just had to say

993.31 --> 1000.63
something I had to be some very moderate

997.69 --> 1003.99
smartass against him basically agna I

1000.63 --> 1006.36
don't believe that but yeah he was kind

1003.99 --> 1010.95
of my boss and probably because I did

1006.36 --> 1012.36
that they thought like mmm not saying it

1010.95 --> 1016.7090000000001
directly because of that but it

1012.36 --> 1018.8100000000001
definitely didn't help but yeah so

1016.709 --> 1021.1199999999999
that's gonna be potentially a problem

1018.81 --> 1023.8499999999999
but yeah then again that's that type of

1021.12 --> 1025.89
career it's like a job at a thing with a

1023.85 --> 1027.9
group of people and you're going to be

1025.89 --> 1029.73
talking with that people so different

1027.9 --> 1033.1200000000001
type of job directions I've already

1029.73 --> 1036.99
talked to some people even through Skype

1033.12 --> 1039.2399999999998
about this that have made some that are

1036.99 --> 1043.799
saying yeah like I have some suggestions

1039.24 --> 1046.41
for you from a different angle from end

1043.799 --> 1049.35
of McKinsey actually some of you may

1046.41 --> 1052.799
know him says he's an automotive

1049.35 --> 1055.53
technician welder it's interesting so

1052.799 --> 1057.96
I'm ready to hear out his story because

1055.53 --> 1063.57
yeah at this point being slapped in the

1057.96 --> 1065.94
face by the county and social welfare

1063.57 --> 1071.1
like this for basically trying to make

1065.94 --> 1073.95
money I feel like yeah maybe I I have to

1071.1 --> 1076.1399999999999
like try a new angle and like because

1073.95 --> 1078.059
yeah the financial situation the

1076.14 --> 1080.2800000000002
long-term plan is still going and it

1078.059 --> 1082.08
might suddenly break out pretty because

1080.28 --> 1084.299
there's a lot of yeah we're switching to

1082.08 --> 1089.49
cryptocurrency and I don't know how well

1084.299 --> 1092.429
that is even gonna go and I might have

1089.49 --> 1095.97
to do something else as well so I don't

1092.429 --> 1101.27
know I'm exploring options but in the

1095.97 --> 1104.6100000000001
meantime yeah that p1000 I still yeah

1101.27 --> 1107.73
I'm still gonna try it so I hope you

1104.61 --> 1111.0
guys will like it well liked the idea

1107.73 --> 1112.98
and will help me get it

1111.0 --> 1119.76
I've been asking for since early bird

1112.98 --> 1120.15
show started and even before that all

1119.76 --> 1123.54
right

1120.15 --> 1129.5700000000002
yeah x3 20 thanks for the suggestion I I

1123.54 --> 1134.1599999999999
do actually have a twitch account so I'm

1129.57 --> 1135.9299999999998
thinking of at some point I I almost got

1134.16 --> 1137.88
it set up it's just like I don't know

1135.93 --> 1139.6200000000001
anything about Twitter's there's like

1137.88 --> 1141.3300000000002
only one other guy that I know that does

1139.62 --> 1144.11
YouTube and that's also goes to twitch

1141.33 --> 1148.1699999999998
and that's lyft feel Daniel solvent and

1144.11 --> 1150.81
I would like to try that I have no idea

1148.17 --> 1154.65
where it will lead to if I do that but

1150.81 --> 1156.8999999999999
it might just figure out like okay how

1154.65 --> 1161.19
do I turn this on try it out let's do it

1156.9 --> 1162.93
bang and who knows what'll happen I

1161.19 --> 1170.64
don't know twitch is an entirely

1162.93 --> 1173.46
different type of platform hmm so yeah

1170.64 --> 1178.44
still the options are there I kind of

1173.46 --> 1182.18
have to just get myself to try out

1178.44 --> 1182.18
several things and don't forget about it

1189.82 --> 1200.87
ha D&D gaming right truth is truth but

1196.12 --> 1204.83
if I'm gonna do something like that that

1200.87 --> 1208.01
is so brutally difficult and what I mean

1204.83 --> 1212.03
by that is for me it's really difficult

1208.01 --> 1214.04
to basically have to because I would

1212.03 --> 1216.8
definitely be a gay master of course

1214.04 --> 1218.33
because otherwise yeah gamer doesn't

1216.8 --> 1220.97
make any I would have to be a game

1218.33 --> 1224.36
master online credits with hangouts

1220.97 --> 1229.46
potentially or whatever but then there's

1224.36 --> 1231.8
the issue it's gonna be kind of more

1229.46 --> 1234.02
professional I'm gonna have to I'm will

1231.8 --> 1238.43
lose track of my old gaming group

1234.02 --> 1241.79
because of that so to be pragmatic about

1238.43 --> 1245.98
that in order for that to be able to

1241.79 --> 1248.96
really become a real successful thing

1245.98 --> 1251.03
I'd have to seize my old gaming group

1248.96 --> 1253.7
which I've been playing with for five

1251.03 --> 1258.29
years and I kinda wanna at least finish

1253.7 --> 1260.99
certain stories and then we'll see maybe

1258.29 --> 1264.98
I can do it make maybe I can apply my

1260.99 --> 1269.42
world again and then kind of do a more

1264.98 --> 1272.3600000000001
public D&D thing with it but that's like

1269.42 --> 1276.52
that's pretty heavy stuff like do not

1272.36 --> 1280.79
underestimate the the heaviness of what

1276.52 --> 1285.92
the indie games requires in energy and

1280.79 --> 1289.25
focus and time so hmm but that's also

1285.92 --> 1291.68
not yeah you know the funny thing is I

1289.25 --> 1295.1
had a weird thing before we're through

1291.68 --> 1296.99
the meetup site where I do my where I

1295.1 --> 1299.75
met my day indie group we still keep

1296.99 --> 1302.1200000000001
contact through that thing I met a guy

1299.75 --> 1305.51
that basically even paid me I was kind

1302.12 --> 1308.33
of weird to give him like D&D Gaming

1305.51 --> 1311.24
lessons about the basics that was really

1308.33 --> 1314.6299999999999
weird but that happened as well and he

1311.24 --> 1317.6
said there were courses like that

1314.63 --> 1319.67
this with a room and a lot more

1317.6 --> 1321.05
entertainment surrounding that that were

1319.67 --> 1322.97
extremely expensive

1321.05 --> 1326.6599999999999
that like that take costs like a

1322.97 --> 1329.54
thousand euros a session and apparently

1326.66 --> 1331.5500000000002
that's a thing that's weird

1329.54 --> 1334.1299999999999
I never expected that maybe it's an

1331.55 --> 1335.8999999999999
entirely different type of crowd that's

1334.13 --> 1338.5700000000002
not like the regular gaming crowd

1335.9 --> 1342.95
because most of them are not really rich

1338.57 --> 1345.8
people on average so I don't know that

1342.95 --> 1363.6200000000001
was weird so I did you know the world is

1345.8 --> 1367.58
big freaking place right the indie tech

1363.62 --> 1373.25
support well you know what

1367.58 --> 1376.8999999999999
I could educate game masters which is

1373.25 --> 1379.64
probably one of the toughest roles

1376.9 --> 1382.01
toughest thinks that I can educate gay

1379.64 --> 1385.16
masters really well actually

1382.01 --> 1387.74
I know a lot about gay mastering I know

1385.16 --> 1390.74
a lot about there's like charts about a

1387.74 --> 1393.29
charts about that stuff like flow charts

1390.74 --> 1397.16
on how to properly setup different type

1393.29 --> 1401.3899999999999
of campaigns it's crazy how well it's

1397.16 --> 1403.7900000000002
like like a giant architecture project

1401.39 --> 1406.6100000000001
in story development those kind of

1403.79 --> 1409.01
charts are there exist about the indie

1406.61 --> 1411.29
gaming game mastering and building

1409.01 --> 1414.17
worlds it's crazy everything is out

1411.29 --> 1418.79
there but I I have a lot of experience

1414.17 --> 1421.3700000000001
and I can definitely help game masters

1418.79 --> 1424.52
out with issues and I have a lot of

1421.37 --> 1430.52
psychology skills so I can even help out

1424.52 --> 1434.36
game masters with that want to be a game

1430.52 --> 1438.92
master I can educate you but I'm not

1434.36 --> 1441.49
gonna do that for free cuz it'll take a

1438.92 --> 1441.49
lot of time

1448.5 --> 1458.22
so yeah I might want to get back to more

1451.28 --> 1461.9289999999999
irregular flatter subject God hey hello

1458.22 --> 1461.929
Geo shifter good to see you again

1462.62 --> 1467.09
you think that Brenda is rich

1471.5 --> 1481.009
it's really weird you know because I've

1478.309 --> 1485.74
been confronted with Brenda and yeah you

1481.009 --> 1494.559
know Brenda arson that notorious baller

1485.74 --> 1494.559
drone and it's so weird because I think

1494.59 --> 1500.1789999999999
through just analyzing her I think she

1498.35 --> 1504.5
may actually be working for the

1500.179 --> 1509.1200000000001
government because she is so adapted to

1504.5 --> 1512.6
the social justice she is one and she's

1509.12 --> 1515.9799999999998
fishing constantly fishing just like

1512.6 --> 1519.049
psychology fishing but she's doing it in

1515.98 --> 1520.779
a way that I recognize which makes it

1519.049 --> 1525.049
kind of more on a professional level

1520.779 --> 1528.32
level so I think she's data fishing to

1525.049 --> 1530.389
potentially entrap people in order to

1528.32 --> 1532.25
for the government to be able to target

1530.389 --> 1534.769
them something like that or maybe she's

1532.25 --> 1539.72
just thinking that she's doing that and

1534.769 --> 1549.47
hoping that at some point she can apply

1539.72 --> 1553.159
it but she is I it's hard to tell I

1549.47 --> 1558.5
think she is actually kind of evil I

1553.159 --> 1561.7990000000002
don't think she's trustworthy with

1558.5 --> 1564.409
anything like she's potentially more

1561.799 --> 1568.19
dangerous than she makes herself appear

1564.409 --> 1570.7990000000002
to be and now of course it's through the

1568.19 --> 1574.039
internet so yeah what can she do but she

1570.799 --> 1576.62
is data fishing absolutely she's

1574.039 --> 1579.74
constantly trying to trick people into

1576.62 --> 1581.4189999999999
putting things out of context in order

1579.74 --> 1583.549
to kind of like stamp them with a

1581.419 --> 1585.5
statement that sounds either insane or

1583.549 --> 1589.85
evil or crazy

1585.5 --> 1591.409
and she does this every single time we

1589.85 --> 1593.12
talk every single time without an

1591.409 --> 1597.6100000000001
exception it's just like a straw man

1593.12 --> 1597.61
professional at it and

1599.01 --> 1603.419
she's not really trying to progress

1604.47 --> 1610.45
understanding like for example rumpus is

1608.409 --> 1612.73
doing although fanatically on the baller

1610.45 --> 1615.19
side but he's constantly constructing

1612.73 --> 1621.48
the system Brenna doesn't do that Brenda

1615.19 --> 1624.8200000000002
is just a baseline drone she doesn't she

1621.48 --> 1627.49
she takes choices he doesn't really

1624.82 --> 1628.99
understand the wider implications he

1627.49 --> 1631.059
doesn't look at it she chooses

1628.99 --> 1638.49
politically and that's why I think that

1631.059 --> 1643.6
she may actually be a real a real agent

1638.49 --> 1645.929
that's out to get us does that make any

1643.6 --> 1645.9289999999999
sense

1655.66 --> 1660.5500000000002
or maybe she's just literally a nutcase

1658.6 --> 1662.5
social-justice worried that completely

1660.55 --> 1664.84
flipped inside out and she just thinks

1662.5 --> 1667.15
she's doing that or she's pretending

1664.84 --> 1669.37
she's doing that and believing it kind

1667.15 --> 1671.6200000000001
of herself as a suspense of disbelief to

1669.37 --> 1673.84
kind of Bluff us into intimate being

1671.62 --> 1677.52
intimidating maybe it's another act of

1673.84 --> 1680.62
very complicated cycles yeah basically

1677.52 --> 1682.59
psychopathic act that could be as well

1680.62 --> 1686.29
she does have the pasok

1682.59 --> 1689.49
passive-aggressive power in order to be

1686.29 --> 1694.78
able to achieve that seen that before

1689.49 --> 1698.55
but if it's a bluff it's a really good

1694.78 --> 1703.84
love cuz I'm just reading the signs and

1698.55 --> 1705.7
yeah she could be doing that so I am

1703.84 --> 1708.4299999999998
very careful in dealing with her and I

1705.7 --> 1710.82
will freaking burn that straw man down

1708.43 --> 1714.55
with my weenie and flamethrower

1710.82 --> 1716.8899999999999
immediately the second it happens but

1714.55 --> 1719.05
not by over shouting everything but by

1716.89 --> 1721.99
very quickly pointing out out so

1719.05 --> 1724.45
everybody sees it immediately I'm not

1721.99 --> 1729.4
gonna give her a second of chance to

1724.45 --> 1732.64
basically try to yeah stab me with

1729.4 --> 1736.9
something that obviously is not in what

1732.64 --> 1740.98
I did so I wonder if other people see it

1736.9 --> 1745.95
as well she's like trying to frame

1740.98 --> 1745.95
people anyway

1748.0 --> 1753.25
now what look an agent that doesn't mean

1750.97 --> 1756.46
like a secret agent what I'm saying is

1753.25 --> 1760.42
that she may literally be like eight a

1756.46 --> 1764.3700000000001
day together a Fisher a fisherman for a

1760.42 --> 1766.5700000000002
government Institute maybe like John

1764.37 --> 1772.81
quantum eraser even said it like it

1766.57 --> 1776.4099999999999
sounds like the ADL or the what's the

1772.81 --> 1778.36
other one there's this the Poverty Law

1776.41 --> 1781.42
Center what is it the Southern Poverty

1778.36 --> 1784.57
Law Center something like that yeah that

1781.42 --> 1787.27
could be maybe she does have a freaking

1784.57 --> 1790.33
job there it will pay well and they

1787.27 --> 1793.75
absolutely are all totally social

1790.33 --> 1795.97
justice warrior not cases so a lot of

1793.75 --> 1797.32
the employees are because that's what

1795.97 --> 1800.41
they try to focus on that's their

1797.32 --> 1803.56
directive so that would make sense I'm

1800.41 --> 1810.7900000000002
just saying she's one of the few that

1803.56 --> 1813.8999999999999
actually fits that profile very well do

1810.79 --> 1813.8999999999999
you understand what I mean

1815.8 --> 1826.6299999999999
and what about this mark sergeant marco

1818.74 --> 1832.83
bags what about him I I could say a few

1826.63 --> 1836.19
things about mark like he has some weird

1832.83 --> 1839.74
freaky issues kind of thing it's but not

1836.19 --> 1843.25
scary as in like real it's like it I

1839.74 --> 1845.23
think I'm seeing it more and more it

1843.25 --> 1848.44
kind of annoys me I even address it like

1845.23 --> 1854.41
he gets very macabre all of a sudden

1848.44 --> 1856.63
like a weird rebellious it comes from a

1854.41 --> 1862.66
rebellious feeling of rebelling against

1856.63 --> 1866.89
yeah it's it just get from macabre as

1862.66 --> 1869.0500000000002
like a joke it's weird it feels like he

1866.89 --> 1871.3600000000001
does it a little bit too much it's it's

1869.05 --> 1873.19
a form of passive aggressive aggression

1871.36 --> 1878.08
and I think see he does have that in him

1873.19 --> 1881.29
it's just the way he has built himself

1878.08 --> 1884.05
his him just his like how he conducts

1881.29 --> 1886.33
himself it just doesn't really allow it

1884.05 --> 1888.6399999999999
so these type of jokes may be the only

1886.33 --> 1894.3899999999999
way for him to basically vent a bit of

1888.64 --> 1900.43
that but I think that he really is a

1894.39 --> 1903.2800000000002
very caring guy I hope but yeah he

1900.43 --> 1905.17
genuinely he has heart he has real heart

1903.28 --> 1907.33
and he's like very careful with people

1905.17 --> 1915.22
and he's very empathetic because he

1907.33 --> 1917.1699999999998
really looks in a very empathic way with

1915.22 --> 1919.72
people who deals that with yeah with

1917.17 --> 1921.91
people very empathic Lee but he does

1919.72 --> 1925.24
have that weird freaky joke thing

1921.91 --> 1928.03
constantly yeah when he get with when he

1925.24 --> 1931.63
gets with friends that's but yeah I

1928.03 --> 1934.83
don't see an agent an agent of what they

1931.63 --> 1938.2
didn't have flat earth maybe you know

1934.83 --> 1941.4399999999998
but he's not showing signs that he's

1938.2 --> 1943.3
like completely in ethical when it went

1941.44 --> 1945.69
flat earth itself concerns like he

1943.3 --> 1949.779
basically admits I like the standard

1945.69 --> 1956.1390000000001
snow globe model but he also admits like

1949.779 --> 1959.08
yeah there are other ideas and we yeah

1956.139 --> 1964.6589999999999
we need more data and that's that makes

1959.08 --> 1966.129
him correct with whatever he does so I

1964.659 --> 1970.8400000000001
don't see a problem

1966.129 --> 1975.029
ethically it doesn't the symptoms do not

1970.84 --> 1978.399
correspond with with some kind of agency

1975.029 --> 1980.889
it may be some kind of conspiracy though

1978.399 --> 1985.899
but that conspiracy doesn't have to be

1980.889 --> 1988.869
like evil it could be like for example

1985.899 --> 1991.9889999999998
people in between and this sounds weird

1988.869 --> 1994.509
and marks are it like the this is a

1991.989 --> 1997.239
conspiracy type set up that is very

1994.509 --> 1999.549
vague and I'm definitely not claiming

1997.239 --> 2001.95
that this is what Mark Sargeant really

1999.549 --> 2004.95
what made that happen but he might have

2001.95 --> 2007.349
like some friends in good places that

2004.95 --> 2013.0800000000002
kind of had that plan like yeah maybe

2007.349 --> 2016.889
where we can like like twist things and

2013.08 --> 2018.899
then put flat earth out there because we

2016.889 --> 2022.4689999999998
actually don't agree with how things are

2018.899 --> 2024.4789999999998
going on on a higher tier because that

2022.469 --> 2026.339
must have somehow been allowed to happen

2024.479 --> 2027.96
otherwise flat earth would have just

2026.339 --> 2030.69
been nipped in the bud straight away so

2027.96 --> 2032.309
something allowed that and maybe mark

2030.69 --> 2037.679
does have kind of contact with these

2032.309 --> 2039.779
people you might even realize like no

2037.679 --> 2042.1190000000001
powerful some of his friends maybe maybe

2039.779 --> 2044.07
yeah maybe this is all just total

2042.119 --> 2047.359
speculation I don't know it's for mark

2044.07 --> 2054.21
to confirm or disconfirm that or just

2047.359 --> 2056.52
ignore I don't know but as for agency by

2054.21 --> 2063.21
government itself no no government

2056.52 --> 2067.559
directive made that happen but there may

2063.21 --> 2069.2400000000002
be people interacting with government or

2067.559 --> 2071.2200000000003
in the government that had kind of their

2069.24 --> 2073.2299999999996
separate ideas and kind of conspired

2071.22 --> 2076.4289999999996
that made that happen that could have be

2073.23 --> 2079.15
that could be but I don't think it's

2076.429 --> 2083.87
government itself

2079.15 --> 2085.61
like the worst the way are like the only

2083.87 --> 2088.0
way I can conceptualize that the

2085.61 --> 2090.6800000000003
government could be involved is that

2088.0 --> 2094.64
nefarious elements thought it was a good

2090.68 --> 2097.91
thing to let it happen just to get in

2094.64 --> 2100.3399999999997
the way of the baseline narrative to

2097.91 --> 2102.95
cause chaos because that kind of does

2100.34 --> 2103.67
sort of happen and that's why they let

2102.95 --> 2106.1
it happen

2103.67 --> 2108.46
like the Liberals thought haha we can do

2106.1 --> 2111.56
that it's a contracting space dream [ __ ]

2108.46 --> 2114.68
just for nefarious reasons not realizing

2111.56 --> 2116.93
really the implications of it on the

2114.68 --> 2120.56
long run and that we would be joining

2116.93 --> 2123.29
the other side per default because yeah

2120.56 --> 2128.5099999999998
there is only truly and saying people

2123.29 --> 2134.0
choose the insane liberal side so it's

2128.51 --> 2136.3100000000004
complex [ __ ] okay but I don't think the

2134.0 --> 2139.34
government a government decision-making

2136.31 --> 2141.85
like said yes we are gonna appoint these

2139.34 --> 2143.8700000000003
people to put that on the Internet no

2141.85 --> 2147.68
that never happened

2143.87 --> 2152.27
I'm pretty sure of it so that's my take

2147.68 --> 2156.6699999999996
on the conspiracy of how Flat Earth came

2152.27 --> 2162.47
to arrive on YouTube in became popular

2156.67 --> 2165.14
right right

2162.47 --> 2167.0499999999997
yeah Marco backs well that's the funny

2165.14 --> 2169.73
thing about dividing conquer strategy

2167.05 --> 2171.92
you can do a long-term plan with

2169.73 --> 2175.09
dividing conquer or you can make very

2171.92 --> 2178.46
short-term decisions it all depends on

2175.09 --> 2180.98
how the decision-making is done and if

2178.46 --> 2182.18
you just don't have oversight over

2180.98 --> 2184.16
what's going to happen because

2182.18 --> 2186.68
everything is too chaotic then the

2184.16 --> 2191.2999999999997
decision-making will likely become more

2186.68 --> 2196.31
short-run so that makes it a more viable

2191.3 --> 2199.13
choice like oh do you this will totally

2196.31 --> 2202.49
counter the for example the Infowars

2199.13 --> 2203.9
popularity and you saw that that if yeah

2202.49 --> 2205.7299999999996
the Flat Earth is even kind of

2203.9 --> 2210.02
automatically latched on as kind of like

2205.73 --> 2212.03
a start-up competition thing to come to

2210.02 --> 2216.5
the globe of Alex Jones and

2212.03 --> 2218.7200000000003
then that kind of helps it allowed a lot

2216.5 --> 2220.76
of things but now things are settling

2218.72 --> 2222.8599999999997
down it's becoming more mixed in Alex

2220.76 --> 2225.6800000000003
Jones as people that talk about Flat

2222.86 --> 2228.4100000000003
Earth a little bit more and we don't

2225.68 --> 2231.9199999999996
have so many overwhelming Alex Jones

2228.41 --> 2233.96
haters anymore so that short term

2231.92 --> 2237.38
decision that allowed it basically to

2233.96 --> 2239.42
start blossoming didn't may have worked

2237.38 --> 2242.78
on the short run as like kind of a break

2239.42 --> 2245.6
at the time in a way but it was of the

2242.78 --> 2248.3900000000003
very short life and now they've actually

2245.6 --> 2250.22
made an opponent on the long run as they

2248.39 --> 2252.5299999999997
do with basically everything they do

2250.22 --> 2255.56
because they only have opponents and

2252.53 --> 2279.5600000000004
people that don't realize that they are

2255.56 --> 2281.18
everyone's opponents so yeah so I hope

2279.56 --> 2283.63
you guys didn't all fall asleep during

2281.18 --> 2283.6299999999997
all that

2288.89 --> 2300.39
it's ridiculous Marco backs

2291.57 --> 2302.34
why why does Mark fells for me that he

2300.39 --> 2305.79
single-handedly destroys the credibility

2302.34 --> 2309.1200000000003
of Effie really so would you like to

2305.79 --> 2311.31
elaborate in actual detail as to how

2309.12 --> 2313.8599999999997
that I how he's doing that

2311.31 --> 2322.37
what is he completely ruining for

2313.86 --> 2322.3700000000003
everyone like really think about it

2322.7 --> 2326.24
thanks Marco bags

2340.8 --> 2354.9300000000003
making it into a format just to make a

2344.4 --> 2357.39
buck to live okay right so you'd have to

2354.93 --> 2362.0699999999997
kind of like something in order to be

2357.39 --> 2368.7599999999998
able to really be able to live of it

2362.07 --> 2371.04
right don't you so I don't know it

2368.76 --> 2375.15
sounds like who is gonna make a an

2371.04 --> 2378.0299999999997
entire career out of something that just

2375.15 --> 2381.0
makes polarizes everything in the face

2378.03 --> 2382.71
of you just to get by just to make a

2381.0 --> 2384.75
living living out of that because

2382.71 --> 2387.15
anything else is might potentially

2384.75 --> 2389.43
become a lot more difficult fluid

2387.15 --> 2392.01
careers are a lot more difficult so it's

2389.43 --> 2396.7799999999997
basically a one-way choice who is gonna

2392.01 --> 2401.4
do that just to make a buck of that

2396.78 --> 2404.75
format seriously that makes no logical

2401.4 --> 2404.75
sense whatsoever

2414.74 --> 2420.0499999999997
so well maybe it's put should put it in

2418.01 --> 2423.0200000000004
another context and I hope to get some

2420.05 --> 2425.0
understanding for that it's not nothing

2423.02 --> 2428.5099999999998
wrong with supporting yourself if you're

2425.0 --> 2431.63
going to do this kind of thing basically

2428.51 --> 2434.26
full-time you're still gonna have to

2431.63 --> 2437.4500000000003
make a living somehow despite all the

2434.26 --> 2444.38
direct societal disadvantages of doing

2437.45 --> 2449.5099999999998
this so yeah you need to survive it you

2444.38 --> 2451.19
know there's this being a flat earther

2449.51 --> 2454.6090000000004
may get a lot of attention a lot of

2451.19 --> 2459.369
people positive and negative but at the

2454.609 --> 2462.44
same time there is just a direct issue

2459.369 --> 2465.109
that will arrive with society and either

2462.44 --> 2467.21
you will have to be perfect a completely

2465.109 --> 2470.21
concealing anything about it and be able

2467.21 --> 2472.099
to just go along with everything else to

2470.21 --> 2475.94
not arouse suspicion and live with that

2472.099 --> 2477.8300000000004
well I wouldn't be able to can no way

2475.94 --> 2483.349
it's impossible to keep that kind of

2477.83 --> 2487.81
[ __ ] in try or you're gonna have to be

2483.349 --> 2491.3900000000003
your own man and like have basically a

2487.81 --> 2494.359
little financial empire in order to

2491.39 --> 2496.609
defend that kind of stance and not be

2494.359 --> 2500.98
destroyed financially by everything else

2496.609 --> 2500.98
that opposes you so

2504.69 --> 2510.68
those aren't exactly really good options

2513.38 --> 2523.1
you know what I mean and you can divide

2518.55 --> 2523.1000000000004
everyone in those categories basically

2523.76 --> 2532.76
like yeah for example Randy he is his

2527.49 --> 2537.5
own man and he's the laborer and

2532.76 --> 2540.9900000000002
technically he probably gets around by

2537.5 --> 2543.0
just being on the job constantly yeah

2540.99 --> 2544.7099999999996
you don't have to let yourself be

2543.0 --> 2546.56
distracted by conversations because

2544.71 --> 2552.12
there's work to do that works perfectly

2546.56 --> 2554.52
that's a great setup it actually makes

2552.12 --> 2558.66
me wonder like maybe I should kind of

2554.52 --> 2560.55
get into something like that something

2558.66 --> 2565.92
constructive you're just gonna be busy

2560.55 --> 2567.6600000000003
with your hands I can do that [ __ ] kind

2565.92 --> 2572.13
of already proven that to myself with

2567.66 --> 2575.5699999999997
just fixing the window downstairs hey

2572.13 --> 2575.57
Randy good to see you

2580.53 --> 2591.4900000000002
well sorry X 320 flat earth flutters

2587.38 --> 2598.96
flat earth earth it's not a globe to

2591.49 --> 2601.87
presume size and there's definitely no

2598.96 --> 2604.57
outer space maybe an outer gas but how

2601.87 --> 2609.5099999999998
large is that gonna be is it gonna be

2604.57 --> 2613.1200000000003
the infinite cross section of a giant

2609.51 --> 2615.8500000000004
weird spatial looping realm or is it

2613.12 --> 2620.2599999999998
gonna be a tunnel above us or is it

2615.85 --> 2625.5699999999997
gonna be a snow globe above us or how

2620.26 --> 2629.1400000000003
wide is the earth are we in a huge huge

2625.57 --> 2635.77
in all dimensions giant looping aquarium

2629.14 --> 2638.3199999999997
I don't know but a vacuum within the

2635.77 --> 2640.99
confines of the container whatever you

2638.32 --> 2643.51
presume it to be right next to gas

2640.99 --> 2645.8199999999997
pressure of the the types that we know

2643.51 --> 2648.0400000000004
that's never gonna happen that's

2645.82 --> 2650.0800000000004
impossible to demonstrate that that

2648.04 --> 2652.84
could happen no matter the types of

2650.08 --> 2656.95
forces you should jects the experiment

2652.84 --> 2659.8900000000003
to supposedly prove that with two so

2656.95 --> 2661.39
vacuum next to gas pressure within the

2659.89 --> 2663.54
same container however you

2661.39 --> 2666.73
conceptualizes is demonstrably

2663.54 --> 2673.27
impossible no matter the force is

2666.73 --> 2675.63
subjected right so that's that should

2673.27 --> 2675.63
tell you something

2684.369 --> 2693.9100000000003
no no righteous for us Fe is not a

2687.859 --> 2693.91
controlled release not by the mainstream

2694.63 --> 2706.94
it's basically they let it happen that's

2703.91 --> 2709.0989999999997
as far as I can put it and I didn't cook

2706.94 --> 2711.17
yeah I commented on it they let it

2709.099 --> 2713.809
happen it's not a controlled release I

2711.17 --> 2715.819
don't think it was initiated by

2713.809 --> 2720.2200000000003
government they just let it happen and

2715.819 --> 2723.98
things with flat earth were around

2720.22 --> 2728.109
already before that time and they were

2723.98 --> 2730.43
literally algorithmic algorithmically

2728.109 --> 2734.27
extinguished it's yeah they were just

2730.43 --> 2737.8689999999997
removed and nobody really realized that

2734.27 --> 2741.94
even back then there were YouTube things

2737.869 --> 2744.349
with Flat Earth before that way before

2741.94 --> 2751.339
like at the beginning but nobody would

2744.349 --> 2753.8900000000003
ever see that just like yeah although

2751.339 --> 2760.3289999999997
yeah dark world just like I think

2753.89 --> 2765.41
remember seeing Eric Dubay YouTube video

2760.329 --> 2769.46
in 2012 I don't know if that makes sense

2765.41 --> 2773.6299999999997
I did definitely in person see his book

2769.46 --> 2776.359
though one of his books in 2012 I'm

2773.63 --> 2781.88
absolutely certain that was in the real

2776.359 --> 2785.109
physical world so there was already

2781.88 --> 2785.109
flatter stuff around

2789.58 --> 2798.7999999999997
so whatever happened it wasn't like

2795.38 --> 2801.9500000000003
placed in YouTube by governments and

2798.8 --> 2803.78
then that grew no it wasn't put there

2801.95 --> 2806.5099999999998
like in a petri dish no it was already

2803.78 --> 2810.02
there and they basically just Unleashed

2806.51 --> 2812.75
it they let let the the chains off and

2810.02 --> 2816.47
it thence weirdly automatically spread

2812.75 --> 2818.09
out it gave it gained its momentum the

2816.47 --> 2823.1299999999997
mark sergeant's even described this

2818.09 --> 2825.65
through his analysis he kind of supports

2823.13 --> 2826.27
this and I agreed to that it was just

2825.65 --> 2828.9500000000003
insane

2826.27 --> 2831.5
probably for short-run political reasons

2828.95 --> 2835.6989999999996
as I've just explained before this

2831.5 --> 2835.699
[Music]

2840.43 --> 2847.1299999999997
absolutely Marco Beck's

2843.31 --> 2849.35
doubting the globe doubting the globe

2847.13 --> 2855.35
has been happening since it was first

2849.35 --> 2858.46
conceptualized so the globe hasn't

2855.35 --> 2863.17
exactly been very popular worldwide

2858.46 --> 2863.17
before the 1960s

2873.6 --> 2880.77
I think that in retro and this is purely

2878.25 --> 2883.71
I have no direct reference but I think

2880.77 --> 2886.65
that even in the old older times before

2883.71 --> 2888.81
1960 that the people that would talk

2886.65 --> 2890.25
about this about space and what they

2888.81 --> 2895.0499999999997
thought was there without any direct

2890.25 --> 2899.04
proof that they would be considered like

2895.05 --> 2902.01
either government agents or literally

2899.04 --> 2905.58
like wizards that had weird mind-control

2902.01 --> 2908.7900000000004
stories I think that is probably how the

2905.58 --> 2912.24
smarter common folk probably saw this

2908.79 --> 2917.37
back then until it was like mandated

2912.24 --> 2922.35
forced through in the schools and then

2917.37 --> 2925.74
that kind of was like pushed away that

2922.35 --> 2927.75
that old way of viewing at it through

2925.74 --> 2931.9199999999996
brainwashing of generations new

2927.75 --> 2936.36
generations so yeah no direct proof that

2931.92 --> 2942.09
just speculating here but it would make

2936.36 --> 2944.61
sense though because people that are

2942.09 --> 2951.09
smart and that take care of themselves

2944.61 --> 2952.53
figure this [ __ ] out naturally and back

2951.09 --> 2954.33
then yeah you don't put it on the

2952.53 --> 2956.2200000000003
internet but you do you might be

2954.33 --> 2959.22
inclined to talk about out with it with

2956.22 --> 2961.6499999999996
other people and since nobody's being

2959.22 --> 2964.95
conditioned with the globe conditioning

2961.65 --> 2967.02
yet really where maybe some people just

2964.95 --> 2971.0699999999997
really inspired by it as a storytelling

2967.02 --> 2973.41
medium makes sense but no but yeah you

2971.07 --> 2977.19
could talk about it and develop the idea

2973.41 --> 2979.17
and then be likely to keep it to

2977.19 --> 2981.9
yourself since the government seems to

2979.17 --> 2983.9300000000003
be kind of forwarding it and you don't

2981.9 --> 2987.4700000000003
want to get in their way

2983.93 --> 2987.47
that kind of thought

2988.43 --> 2992.18
that makes sense right

3000.059 --> 3003.059
yeah

3014.5 --> 3021.69
that's right yes well

3021.76 --> 3029.38
space was a tool to allow to basically

3027.31 --> 3031.96
this is from an industrialists

3029.38 --> 3035.29
perspective and they were the ones

3031.96 --> 3039.25
technically to kind of Institute yeah to

3035.29 --> 3042.13
do to really put it in a place decide on

3039.25 --> 3046.27
that as a strategy long term strategy

3042.13 --> 3048.4300000000003
too if people would have that dream to

3046.27 --> 3050.8
look forward to it's like in heaven is

3048.43 --> 3052.5299999999997
lit but more literal like a heaven that

3050.8 --> 3056.26
we could one day go to a better place

3052.53 --> 3058.48
physically that then they will be more

3056.26 --> 3062.23
inclined to let the industrialists

3058.48 --> 3067.09
destroy everything around them without

3062.23 --> 3071.46
feeling that that primordial need to

3067.09 --> 3076.27
defend the world and God basically I

3071.46 --> 3080.25
think that is the overarching industrial

3076.27 --> 3084.0099999999998
angle to it right

3080.25 --> 3086.11
give them the dream so we can destroy

3084.01 --> 3087.7900000000004
everything and reap all the rewards or

3086.11 --> 3090.04
for ourself they'll be left in a

3087.79 --> 3091.75
[ __ ] left with that dream that in

3090.04 --> 3094.45
one day they might be able to escape it

3091.75 --> 3097.81
as they all wither away and die and we

3094.45 --> 3100.8399999999997
sit on our golden Thrones in our golden

3097.81 --> 3103.39
palaces and their giant bunkers with

3100.84 --> 3105.6600000000003
armed forces defending them that was

3103.39 --> 3105.66
their idea

3107.71 --> 3113.299
that's probably not the first time an

3110.21 --> 3115.309
idea like that has been kind of applied

3113.299 --> 3118.46
although this was from the Industrial

3115.309 --> 3121.6090000000004
Age a conspiracy from industrialists

3118.46 --> 3127.039
themselves a secret transnational

3121.609 --> 3131.0
conspiracy at it using relate new secret

3127.039 --> 3138.8900000000003
religion and methodologies social

3131.0 --> 3142.7
engineering to alter everything to

3138.89 --> 3145.25
basically destroy the spirit destroy the

3142.7 --> 3149.029
body destroyed the world and become

3145.25 --> 3151.569
satanic Kings on a giant golden throne

3149.029 --> 3155.47
sitting in a pile of ashes and bones

3151.569 --> 3155.47
that's the end result

3165.94 --> 3177.01
mmm that is their vision of capitalism

3170.9 --> 3177.01
and it's just pure all oligarchy really

3181.87 --> 3191.41
yeah it's not the public's capitalism

3184.49 --> 3195.7299999999996
definitely not anyway back to these

3191.41 --> 3195.73
whatever we're talking about right now

3214.26 --> 3216.8300000000004
and

3225.88 --> 3233.829
I agree mystical modular indeed everyone

3230.709 --> 3234.3999999999996
should promote channels they like and I

3233.829 --> 3237.4
do that

3234.4 --> 3239.92
it's basically what I follow and then

3237.4 --> 3242.319
find worthy and keep on following I will

3239.92 --> 3247.119
bring that up just like I say yeah I

3242.319 --> 3251.469
watch Owen Benjamin a lot not everything

3247.119 --> 3255.88
but usually he just hits good things and

3251.469 --> 3258.449
he's very funny in an extreme way rarely

3255.88 --> 3258.449
he isn't

3258.479 --> 3263.68
although man that last dream holy [ __ ]

3261.91 --> 3268.1499999999996
yes they did what there was something

3263.68 --> 3274.269
screwy going on like it became like a

3268.15 --> 3278.049
snapshot kind of video where it was

3274.269 --> 3281.9199999999996
totally totally wrecked the video part

3278.049 --> 3285.779
of that of his dream that was ridiculous

3281.92 --> 3288.849
but yeah something there are some people

3285.779 --> 3292.18
at YouTube that kind of really don't

3288.849 --> 3295.2290000000003
like Owen Benjamin I think they're just

3292.18 --> 3295.229
trying to screw with him

3299.109 --> 3304.959
anyway yeah I watch him and live - Phil

3302.709 --> 3307.8689999999997
- sometimes it's not always interesting

3304.959 --> 3312.5389999999998
but he's like very actual so it's also a

3307.869 --> 3315.5190000000002
good way to like get quick focus in and

3312.539 --> 3316.989
realtalk all things that just happened

3315.519 --> 3319.8689999999997
and I really like that about him

3316.989 --> 3322.66
it's very actual at it and of course I

3319.869 --> 3324.4300000000003
still watch the Alex Jones Show not with

3322.66 --> 3326.2
full attention because there's a lot of

3324.43 --> 3329.2
advertisement but when there's some good

3326.2 --> 3330.999
moments I do reference it so for example

3329.2 --> 3335.2
when Owen Schroyer starts to talk about

3330.999 --> 3337.479
flat earth again as in like we don't

3335.2 --> 3339.519
want them to be silence we don't don't

3337.479 --> 3342.1899999999996
want them to be censored because even

3339.519 --> 3344.799
their free speech matters even if you

3342.19 --> 3346.93
don't agree with it and that's just

3344.799 --> 3348.91
really good that he does that and you

3346.93 --> 3352.299
don't underestimate how many people are

3348.91 --> 3354.0389999999998
gonna be hearing that and what the

3352.299 --> 3356.589
long-term results of that will be it's

3354.039 --> 3358.9300000000003
good they're on our side they really are

3356.589 --> 3360.459
even though you might not like things

3358.93 --> 3362.9199999999996
you may see certain types of political

3360.459 --> 3370.569
size Asian and even fear porn in there

3362.92 --> 3373.7490000000003
and they're still on our side it's just

3370.569 --> 3377.319
another dynamic it's not a target group

3373.749 --> 3379.979
it's and it's not a hundred percent

3377.319 --> 3379.979
right

3380.63 --> 3385.589
it is what it is so I will reference it

3384.15 --> 3390.029
especially when there are points of

3385.589 --> 3392.549
interest and let's see yeah

3390.029 --> 3394.859
of course and Mark and Patricius hang

3392.549 --> 3400.049
out yesterday and Mark was getting extra

3394.859 --> 3403.769
creepy a lot like he's sometimes really

3400.049 --> 3405.21
creeps me out like he really starts to

3403.769 --> 3408.1189999999997
play with your suspense with disbelief

3405.21 --> 3410.339
it's really sneaky it likes it he would

3408.119 --> 3415.2000000000003
definitely enjoys doing that like

3410.339 --> 3422.249
fooling with people like that I think

3415.2 --> 3425.8489999999997
that was the guy again I'm so sorry

3422.249 --> 3427.74
forgetting his name the guy who had the

3425.849 --> 3431.039
Flat Earth friend of our insurer and he

3427.74 --> 3434.279
also was on the Alex Jones Eddie Bravo

3431.039 --> 3438.5890000000004
yeah Eddie Bravo he has the same type of

3434.279 --> 3438.589
thing where it just [ __ ] with people

3439.49 --> 3454.2589999999996
anyway what else did I watch and debates

3449.539 --> 3456.48
bin of Jose's I think it's so much to

3454.259 --> 3459.72
follow these days oh yeah I regularly

3456.48 --> 3462.39
check out Paul Joseph Watson's YouTube

3459.72 --> 3469.5589999999997
videos they're usually shorts very

3462.39 --> 3472.46
gimmicky and I love them I I've rarely

3469.559 --> 3474.869
heard him say anything that's just like

3472.46 --> 3478.17
okay this is just wrong

3474.869 --> 3483.569
you know know if he gets really cheeky

3478.17 --> 3486.2690000000002
and [ __ ] but yeah I think his videos are

3483.569 --> 3488.249
great I just love watching them and he

3486.269 --> 3493.3799999999997
makes good points as well so yeah Paul

3488.249 --> 3496.7389999999996
Joseph Watson check his channel out yeah

3493.38 --> 3498.329
if you don't like really politicize the

3496.739 --> 3500.849
right-wing left with and stuff it's

3498.329 --> 3505.0190000000002
probably not for you I kind of

3500.849 --> 3507.2000000000003
appreciate it yeah right what else was

3505.019 --> 3507.2
on

3509.86 --> 3516.07
yeah I think that was it

3517.0 --> 3526.46
hmm oh damn the hours almost over huh

3522.76 --> 3531.4100000000003
time flies when you're having fun I

3526.46 --> 3534.92
guess oh I might have now skipped

3531.41 --> 3536.75
no I didn't skip guests I think there

3534.92 --> 3541.3
were some people that kind of did want

3536.75 --> 3543.11
to come on I haven't heard from them yet

3541.3 --> 3545.48
didn't get a message

3543.11 --> 3550.88
they're still like this open invitation

3545.48 --> 3554.36
with dress and there's still a night owl

3550.88 --> 3556.19
opportunity lying ahead with Bob from

3554.36 --> 3561.6200000000003
globe Buster's that we might do a show

3556.19 --> 3565.01
together about gravity I hope that works

3561.62 --> 3567.0499999999997
out all right it's gonna be a tough one

3565.01 --> 3573.05
I know it you've already had pretty

3567.05 --> 3575.53
tough discussions over Skype so but

3573.05 --> 3578.6600000000003
still yeah we'll be interesting to do

3575.53 --> 3580.9700000000003
all right so anyway I'm think I'm gonna

3578.66 --> 3584.0
run out the show don't forget of course

3580.97 --> 3585.25
the flat earth night I'll show this

3584.0 --> 3590.15
evening

3585.25 --> 3592.7
it should let's see yes it should start

3590.15 --> 3596.87
in six hours from now maybe a little

3592.7 --> 3600.0099999999998
later I don't know yet to before I don't

3596.87 --> 3600.0099999999998
know a what

3605.58 --> 3620.31
I don't know for sure although I don't

3616.44 --> 3624.4700000000003
know 100% for sure if yeah if it's gonna

3620.31 --> 3624.47
work out like as I said I have some

3624.74 --> 3632.0699999999997
annoyingly doubtful feelings about it

3628.14 --> 3634.23
but I don't know I don't want to be too

3632.07 --> 3636.6600000000003
disappointed and just say yeah I'm gonna

3634.23 --> 3642.63
make it because this it's weird it

3636.66 --> 3647.37
almost feels like I am soliciting for a

3642.63 --> 3648.81
job and then I put a lot of energy in it

3647.37 --> 3652.2799999999997
and when I don't get it even though I

3648.81 --> 3657.06
give it everything that hurts like [ __ ]

3652.28 --> 3659.13
so I that's why I don't like recognizing

3657.06 --> 3662.1
this feeling because if this is not

3659.13 --> 3665.7000000000003
gonna work out I it might kind of hurt

3662.1 --> 3667.3199999999997
my feelings oh dear Arwen but I'm just

3665.7 --> 3670.1099999999997
gonna deal with it and that's why I'm

3667.32 --> 3671.5800000000004
like being slightly hesitant I don't

3670.11 --> 3676.17
know how it's gonna go but I'm gonna try

3671.58 --> 3678.0299999999997
and we'll see where it goes and I and I

3676.17 --> 3681.42
hope all this stupid doubting from my

3678.03 --> 3684.9900000000002
side it's just gonna be non Stern out to

3681.42 --> 3687.54
be nonsense we'll see this evening on

3684.99 --> 3691.2
the flat earth night I'll show number

3687.54 --> 3694.38
three and I hope I probably at least be

3691.2 --> 3697.23
joined by by Riley who promised to come

3694.38 --> 3699.09
and yeah I expect kind of taranta to

3697.23 --> 3701.67
join in as well maybe Nathan will come

3699.09 --> 3703.92
on I don't know I don't know a lot of

3701.67 --> 3709.17
people could join maybe Karen B would

3703.92 --> 3713.85
come on well you know what since it's

3709.17 --> 3715.53
Skype technically yeah if like to any

3713.85 --> 3718.5299999999997
people I don't know how many people do

3715.53 --> 3720.3300000000004
fit on a Skype call but as many people

3718.53 --> 3723.8700000000003
as want to come and just talk about

3720.33 --> 3727.5299999999997
