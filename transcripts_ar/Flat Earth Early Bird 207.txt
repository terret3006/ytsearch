38.78 --> 46.410000000000004
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

42.84 --> 48.27
early-bird number 207 I'm your host

46.41 --> 50.25
Arwen and before we start the show

48.27 --> 53.34
please don't forget to share it on any

50.25 --> 55.199
platform you deem fit and also if you

58.86 --> 66.21
normally 2:00 p.m. Amsterdam time and

62.059 --> 68.88
also please support my channel well

66.21 --> 73.91999999999999
through Super chats but preferably Skype

68.88 --> 76.53
Skype did again sorry

73.92 --> 79.05
through PayPal and yeah you can also

76.53 --> 81.3
support the projects like patreon and

79.05 --> 83.97
the GoFundMe Oh in the description box

81.3 --> 88.92
below so yeah let's see what kind of

83.97 --> 94.039
weather it is today it's it's pretty

88.92 --> 98.34
warm but yeah still there's like a

94.039 --> 102.479
couple of chemtrail clouds from earlier

98.34 --> 104.7
on and yeah they've spread out pretty an

102.479 --> 106.86
interesting pattern because it look at

104.7 --> 111.149
that it's just weird is that a natural

106.86 --> 118.289
cloud really tell me that's a natural

111.149 --> 120.3
cloud serious so yeah it's windy that's

118.289 --> 123.59
the weird thing it is sunny but it's

120.3 --> 128.57999999999998
also extremely windy you can see in here

123.59 --> 131.25
the whole thing like and these winds get

128.58 --> 134.03
pretty hard but yeah at the same time

131.25 --> 134.03
it's warm and

134.64 --> 144.45
pretty nice day except for the

138.12 --> 148.13
chemtrails yeah weird cloud indeed so I

144.45 --> 153.98
with me I got tumeric coffee again and

148.13 --> 159.35
some tea that's it

153.98 --> 162.17999999999998
and tonight I got gaming night landing

159.35 --> 164.19
finally after skipping some it's

162.18 --> 166.89000000000001
basically still the same session that we

164.19 --> 170.55
were supposed to be playing this is now

166.89 --> 173.79
a week ago no wait no even more one a

170.55 --> 176.4
half weeks ago Monday last week and that

173.79 --> 178.2
never happened so finally I'm gonna be

176.4 --> 181.05
able to do that now I've been basically

178.2 --> 184.01
waiting because I planned pretty much

181.05 --> 184.01000000000002
everything I could

184.11 --> 192.24
oh so yeah I had some there were some

188.91 --> 198.57
just amazing hangouts in the last 24

192.24 --> 204.959
hours I've been on YouTube literally

198.57 --> 207.78
non-stop it's tough to remember

204.959 --> 214.79
everything though but yeah I won't

207.78 --> 218.22
Benjamin was just really interesting and

214.79 --> 223.10999999999999
he again he brings up Tesla more often

218.22 --> 226.22
and he also gets into these I say these

223.11 --> 230.43
the personality type designations and

226.22 --> 234.75
it's very interesting but I wonder where

230.43 --> 238.26000000000002
he's like what is the table for this

234.75 --> 241.68
orientation of the Alpha the beta the

238.26 --> 244.489
gamma the Delta and the Sigma like I

241.68 --> 249.06
know where these letters come from but

244.489 --> 251.489
yeah when I look it up I'm not really

249.06 --> 253.739
getting results I'm wondering like where

251.489 --> 257.37
is the primary source for this type of

253.739 --> 259.59000000000003
designation it's interesting and I've

257.37 --> 263.43
yeah been into that and just realize

259.59 --> 266.34999999999997
like okay well the way he describes

263.43 --> 270.34000000000003
Delta that just seems extremely familiar

266.35 --> 274.0
like when I try to correct somebody I

270.34 --> 277.0
don't do it to humiliate them I do it to

274.0 --> 278.77
help them even though it can be you me

277.0 --> 282.24
it's like an accidental side effect and

278.77 --> 285.54999999999995
that is apparently typically Delta and

282.24 --> 287.53000000000003
yeah people might have that kind of

285.55 --> 292.57
really took the time to get to know me

287.53 --> 295.21
might see this in how other people react

292.57 --> 298.33
tend to react to me and hey I can be

295.21 --> 300.52
extremely goofy and distracting so that

298.33 --> 304.53999999999996
factor doesn't help I understand that

300.52 --> 308.74
it's just how I run sometimes so but

304.54 --> 309.64000000000004
yeah then there was the comparison with

308.74 --> 312.64
Tesla

309.64 --> 318.96999999999997
supposedly marrying his pigeon and I

312.64 --> 320.28999999999996
thought like with Tesla and how Owen

318.97 --> 322.21000000000004
describes him and I think it's pretty

320.29 --> 324.91
accurate like I've looked into that

322.21 --> 326.91999999999996
before like my brother had a great

324.91 --> 332.86
respect for Tesla did actually read

326.92 --> 335.29
stuff and he was like an idol in a way

332.86 --> 337.27000000000004
like after Einstein interestingly enough

335.29 --> 339.07
because my brother at some point had

337.27 --> 341.2
like a poster of Einstein and then

339.07 --> 344.2
suddenly it disappeared so I think he

341.2 --> 349.53999999999996
kind of figured it out as well and that

344.2 --> 352.51
was like Jesus that was like 25 years

349.54 --> 354.43
ago but then again my brother is 7 years

352.51 --> 358.12
older than me but he's like my brother

354.43 --> 361.90000000000003
is much smarter than me but in the sense

358.12 --> 364.21
that he just has a better grip on

361.9 --> 366.21999999999997
information but I've always been much

364.21 --> 368.28
better dealing with my feelings than he

366.22 --> 371.89000000000004
has he's always been just completely

368.28 --> 375.07
clamped in the feeling department not

371.89 --> 379.65999999999997
autistic or anything just I don't know

375.07 --> 383.2
like a typical guy closedness because

379.66 --> 385.36
he's just like he's not that he's never

383.2 --> 386.77
really been the best at really dealing

385.36 --> 389.44
with it although I think yeah he's

386.77 --> 391.9
probably all that now he has had kids so

389.44 --> 395.56
he will have been in this time forced to

391.9 --> 400.87
deal with that yeah it's really terrible

395.56 --> 402.7
like because I barely last time I spoke

400.87 --> 408.82
to him even just speaking to him it's

402.7 --> 411.67
been three years ago so I don't know I

408.82 --> 414.49
don't know him anymore really but I'm

411.67 --> 416.92
basically building on how I I knew him

414.49 --> 422.38
and he's probably learned a lot since

416.92 --> 424.45
then but yeah he ripped the Einstein

422.38 --> 425.92
post her away apparently because he

424.45 --> 427.96
figured out that it wasn't that great

425.92 --> 431.95
after all it was just a speculator and

427.96 --> 443.60999999999996
he was being put on a pedestal and it

431.95 --> 451.48
was a cousin [ __ ] e equals MC square

443.61 --> 456.21000000000004
was it yeah Einstein married two cousins

451.48 --> 460.03000000000003
twice that's it so and but yeah Tesla

456.21 --> 462.729
was pretty much from their own and I get

460.03 --> 466.17999999999995
that and Owen Benjamin has that as well

462.729 --> 468.37
now Tesla supposedly was like the the

466.18 --> 470.8
king of deltas and that will be probably

468.37 --> 474.55
correct so I'm not like trying to

470.8 --> 478.21000000000004
compare myself to Tesla but I do feel

474.55 --> 483.99
like I have like Tesla like this amazing

478.21 --> 488.46999999999997
source in my mind that is just beyond

483.99 --> 491.59000000000003
the regular that I can figure out things

488.47 --> 494.22
subtly the the problem is with me really

491.59 --> 494.21999999999997
is that

496.81 --> 503.11
I don't know I guess I would have to say

500.5 --> 505.9
really that because Tesla definitely

503.11 --> 507.82
underwent his challenges like you you

505.9 --> 511.71999999999997
had didn't have like a really nice

507.82 --> 514.0
comfortable life all of the time so he

511.72 --> 516.58
wasn't spoiled or anything so I just

514.0 --> 522.4
have to conclude that Tesla was made of

516.58 --> 524.86
sterner stuff than me and maybe also he

522.4 --> 529.42
was just so excellent at taking care of

524.86 --> 532.23
his himself that he was just like yeah

529.42 --> 535.6899999999999
perfect yeah I perfectly defended

532.23 --> 538.15
spiritually in a time where that was

535.69 --> 540.37
kind of do more doable because they

538.15 --> 541.9599999999999
didn't have freaking radio towers

540.37 --> 544.42
everywhere and they weren't spraying

541.96 --> 547.86
chemtrails in the media wasn't just

544.42 --> 552.3389999999999
outright demonic and insane 90-84

547.86 --> 555.64
so maybe if I'd have lived during that

552.339 --> 559.48
time I might have accomplished something

555.64 --> 561.1899999999999
similar maybe one maybe proud yeah now

559.48 --> 566.04
I'm not as good at Tesla I'm pretty sure

561.19 --> 568.7800000000001
I'm not at the same time with his

566.04 --> 571.63
intelligence he also paid the price for

568.78 --> 573.49
that and not like building the price

571.63 --> 577.06
because of the devil no it's just the

573.49 --> 579.88
burden of intelligence I know I am

577.06 --> 581.92
pretty intelligent and it probably was

579.88 --> 583.54
in my youth much more intelligent but

581.92 --> 586.2099999999999
what people don't understand is the

583.54 --> 589.0
burden that comes with it it's like a

586.21 --> 591.37
literal pressure because you see so much

589.0 --> 593.17
more and you see how out of control

591.37 --> 596.08
things are and then you can do two

593.17 --> 598.4499999999999
things you can either panic and just

596.08 --> 602.47
throw it all off rebel against reality

598.45 --> 608.2900000000001
or you can take that burden and then you

602.47 --> 613.5400000000001
just it's like job stress except this is

608.29 --> 615.61
just for existing for realizing like you

613.54 --> 617.8
can see things you could think fix

615.61 --> 620.7
things but it's so incredibly difficult

617.8 --> 623.05
because people are in the way everywhere

620.7 --> 624.5500000000001
that is basically what's going to be

623.05 --> 626.8
what it's going to be like

624.55 --> 630.0
and that's kind of how I experienced it

626.8 --> 630.0
to some degree No

633.41 --> 639.6
but yeah again back to the the idea of

637.14 --> 643.92
that Tesla supposedly married a pigeon

639.6 --> 645.9
and I'm thinking like there's no way

643.92 --> 652.02
that a guy that would be that serious

645.9 --> 655.8
would do that just like that like some

652.02 --> 657.6899999999999
kind of statement or like screw Society

655.8 --> 659.64
I'm gonna marry my pigeon I didn't care

657.69 --> 662.37
what people think now that doesn't make

659.64 --> 667.23
any sense so what I think really

662.37 --> 670.23
happened is as the Olli hockey was

667.23 --> 672.96
basically taking over and Tesla decided

670.23 --> 675.66
yeah I'm not gonna be part of this I'll

672.96 --> 677.82
give you some of the [ __ ] you can have

675.66 --> 682.0799999999999
the patents everything all that and with

677.82 --> 684.12
Edison and Edison yeah like Edison is

682.08 --> 687.87
one guy but he was part of that

684.12 --> 689.94
oligarchy machine so because of Edison

687.87 --> 693.42
there were also others involved that

689.94 --> 695.6400000000001
were probably a lot darker and even back

693.42 --> 697.9699999999999
then I can definitely imagine that they

695.64 --> 700.86
would kind of like systematically and

697.97 --> 704.6700000000001
for sins on people it's also something

700.86 --> 706.83
that Owen Benjamin talked about like he

704.67 --> 708.66
calls it sex magic I don't call it that

706.83 --> 711.7800000000001
at all again it's like a terrible

708.66 --> 714.8399999999999
designation it's sin magic it's making

711.78 --> 717.9
people commit sin or like derail

714.84 --> 721.5300000000001
themselves from God be unnatural and

717.9 --> 724.23
break themselves and Tesla probably was

721.53 --> 727.17
threatened by the same people like yeah

724.23 --> 730.9200000000001
you're gonna go down in history as way

727.17 --> 733.89
too reasonable way too smart so you're

730.92 --> 738.3299999999999
gonna have to do something then I either

733.89 --> 741.21
make you disgusting and evil or we're

738.33 --> 742.7900000000001
gonna do such we're gonna subject you to

741.21 --> 746.4000000000001
such physical torture

742.79 --> 748.65
yeah you just do whatever we want and

746.4 --> 751.8
then I think he kind of like in a risk

748.65 --> 755.73
move calculated just said you know what

751.8 --> 757.74
I'll just become I'll just be cuckoo

755.73 --> 761.399
okay I'll marry my freakin pigeon

757.74 --> 763.35
alright and I'll be I'll never marry and

761.399 --> 765.81
have kids I'll just marry my freakin

763.35 --> 768.029
pigeon you can put that in your [ __ ]

765.81 --> 771.029
history books and just leave me alone

768.029 --> 774.329
and I think they went for it and I think

771.029 --> 776.399
that is what really happened with Tesla

774.329 --> 778.15
I don't think he ever did anything like

776.399 --> 783.58
that

778.15 --> 788.019
out of his own volition so

783.58 --> 792.72
the note finally got to the point right

788.019 --> 792.72
so then Oh what is this

796.39 --> 799.529
who are you people

801.65 --> 809.27
hello everyone okay there's a lot of new

806.99 --> 813.08

917.17 --> 922.93
don't know if they're like trolls or

919.18 --> 924.9399999999999
anything but welcome to my show so I was

922.93 --> 933.43
talking about Tesla for a moment before

924.94 --> 938.0790000000001
this and then also I was in chat at

933.43 --> 939.4899999999999
Jose's just a chat got a bit rayji are

938.079 --> 943.5999999999999
we yeah

939.49 --> 945.55
rage win but not too far I was just

943.6 --> 948.3100000000001
getting really really sick off there

945.55 --> 951.43
yeah there absolute baller troll ism and

948.31 --> 955.1199999999999
literally just like these people try to

951.43 --> 957.25
tire you out they know it they know they

955.12 --> 959.32
have no response and then they just on

957.25 --> 961.36
purpose start repeating the same [ __ ]

959.32 --> 965.519
over or red-herring you entirely because

961.36 --> 970.0600000000001
they literally want to tire you out

965.519 --> 972.07
that's they just want you to die that's

970.06 --> 975.209
the only thing they're really trying to

972.07 --> 978.5400000000001
accomplish they just want you to die

975.209 --> 982.779
just to choke out and fall over and die

978.54 --> 987.49
because they can't compete they can't

982.779 --> 990.3
compete not really so that's all they

987.49 --> 993.5790000000001
really have left just to tire you out

990.3 --> 999.01
until you die they literally try to make

993.579 --> 1001.3199999999999
you destroy yourself and sometimes well

999.01 --> 1004.35
most of the time I just ignore it but

1001.32 --> 1008.5400000000001
sometimes when I really do make a point

1004.35 --> 1014.339
I can get quite verbally aggressive

1008.54 --> 1016.92
high-tier basically starting to yeah use

1014.339 --> 1019.0400000000001
my it almost feels like abusing my

1016.92 --> 1021.63
insides but just like totally

1019.04 --> 1024.75
designating the [ __ ] out of everything

1021.63 --> 1028.5
basically casting spells its casting

1024.75 --> 1032.88
spells based on my insights that should

1028.5 --> 1035.85
like touch them because I figure out

1032.88 --> 1037.8600000000001
that that kind of thought must be going

1035.85 --> 1040.62
through them that's what I'm trying to

1037.86 --> 1043.62
do I'm trying to disseminate how their

1040.62 --> 1045.35
mind works and reveal their secrets

1043.62 --> 1048.6789999999999
sounds really dark one

1045.35 --> 1051.6499999999999
say it's like that but yeah when I get

1048.679 --> 1055.0900000000001
really frickin pissed off that's

1051.65 --> 1055.0900000000001
something that can happen

1070.39 --> 1077.1100000000001
okay not really dark admirable yeah but

1073.179 --> 1080.3200000000002
it sounds like dark magic like I could

1077.11 --> 1085.08
imagine like if I had this skill and I

1080.32 --> 1087.73
let's just say okay I am in a village in

1085.08 --> 1090.37
Renaissance or medieval time people

1087.73 --> 1092.65
would be freaked out because I could do

1090.37 --> 1095.9799999999998
the same [ __ ] face-to-face it's not just

1092.65 --> 1098.14
a weird internet only thing although the

1095.98 --> 1099.91
internet does take away especially if

1098.14 --> 1103.2900000000002
you're in chat only not on camera it

1099.91 --> 1105.52
does kind of give a safe screen to

1103.29 --> 1107.71
elaborate further that's kind of the

1105.52 --> 1109.299
same at the same time the problem with

1107.71 --> 1111.88
trolls is that they got so much

1109.299 --> 1115.6299999999999
protection because of the internet and

1111.88 --> 1118.929
anonymity of it the direct protection of

1115.63 --> 1121.8300000000002
of your of the energies that come off

1118.929 --> 1129.46
you as you do something like that that's

1121.83 --> 1134.049
but now I lost track you could call it a

1129.46 --> 1139.63
durable because it works but really it

1134.049 --> 1142.059
is it does kind of feel like dark and it

1139.63 --> 1145.2700000000002
is not driven by love really although

1142.059 --> 1149.83
one could say it is kind of like hatred

1145.27 --> 1153.76
that then tries to find like force its

1149.83 --> 1158.9099999999999
way through the energies and then find a

1153.76 --> 1162.82
way to like punish them like a child

1158.91 --> 1164.679
like that is really out of control like

1162.82 --> 1165.9099999999999
you sometimes when they get really

1164.679 --> 1169.9
berserk or anything

1165.91 --> 1172.48
you got to punish them it's like I had

1169.9 --> 1174.46
that and I'm like when I was a little

1172.48 --> 1177.4
kid I could sometimes just go completely

1174.46 --> 1179.44
out of control especially when I was

1177.4 --> 1182.919
manic and then stopped I would just go

1179.44 --> 1185.38
evil like no I have to do this and like

1182.919 --> 1188.14
you're not gonna stop me and it could be

1185.38 --> 1190.24
like freaking computer games or [ __ ] but

1188.14 --> 1192.5800000000002
I had these moods sometimes and my

1190.24 --> 1195.34
parents punished me and I just got livid

1192.58 --> 1196.9399999999998
from that [ __ ] but I am so glad they did

1195.34 --> 1200.8999999999999
that

1196.94 --> 1203.18
so glad they did that and in a way I'm

1200.9 --> 1208.4
kind of like trying to do the same thing

1203.18 --> 1212.0900000000001
and I try to let my natural hate force

1208.4 --> 1217.99
me to bypass the frequency of it and

1212.09 --> 1217.99
then yeah strengthen another process

1218.26 --> 1225.65
turn the rage into into the form of

1221.78 --> 1231.23
dominance basically instead of just

1225.65 --> 1235.21
violence and it's a trick that I've been

1231.23 --> 1238.64
trying out yeah all throughout my life

1235.21 --> 1240.3500000000001
for me at times it was even the only way

1238.64 --> 1244.42
I could get any kind of dominance

1240.35 --> 1247.9699999999998
because I'm not a particularly big guy I

1244.42 --> 1250.91
thought my self-esteem has never been

1247.97 --> 1253.04
extremely solid in my youth had my good

1250.91 --> 1257.93
moments but I had my bad moments and

1253.04 --> 1265.3999999999999
then it was terrible so I kind of used

1257.93 --> 1268.79
that to get some respect I don't know I

1265.4 --> 1272.39
just had to learn that anyway let's get

1268.79 --> 1274.37
back into Flat Earth so yeah or in

1272.39 --> 1276.5500000000002
science at least it was funny there was

1274.37 --> 1279.9199999999998
a discussion in josé's yesterday about

1276.55 --> 1280.9099999999999
the molten iron core and it went all

1279.92 --> 1286.3400000000001
over the place

1280.91 --> 1288.92
and I I got involved in the chat so I

1286.34 --> 1292.85
basically started proposing certain

1288.92 --> 1296.17
things it was kind of a risk I was like

1292.85 --> 1299.6299999999999
the energy was already kind of like

1296.17 --> 1302.21
venting so I was kind of overdoing it

1299.63 --> 1305.7800000000002
but I basically made a statement like

1302.21 --> 1310.64
yeah molten iron you know we all know

1305.78 --> 1313.76
okay the irony no longer is like

1310.64 --> 1318.22
touchable is no longer gripa ball

1313.76 --> 1321.5
I'm a get ISM after a certain heat point

1318.22 --> 1323.33
which is can be melting and then they

1321.5 --> 1325.25
just delay it's no longer it can no

1323.33 --> 1330.83
longer be touched by that's interesting

1325.25 --> 1337.9
and for example mercury can also be

1330.83 --> 1343.31
like pushed around by magnetic forces

1337.9 --> 1347.21
but only solid matter and this is just

1343.31 --> 1352.94
uniform only solid matter can actually

1347.21 --> 1355.94
hold its own magnetic field where the

1352.94 --> 1359.29
magnetic field is not externally caused

1355.94 --> 1362.5700000000002
by something like an electromagnet or

1359.29 --> 1368.68
something else so yeah fluid and all

1362.57 --> 1372.22
that it can be affected by magnetics and

1368.68 --> 1375.8600000000001
potentially gases as well but it can't

1372.22 --> 1381.1100000000001
create a magnetic field only solid

1375.86 --> 1383.9299999999998
particles can create like have their own

1381.11 --> 1387.08
magnetic fields separate from outside

1383.93 --> 1390.17
influences and they just didn't get it

1387.08 --> 1393.1699999999998
and they went like totally apeshit on

1390.17 --> 1396.44
the peer pressure like especially lki

1393.17 --> 1400.01
told I told Riley about this because he

1396.44 --> 1402.26
used to love to say that word LK but he

1400.01 --> 1405.35
went just nuts in Chadha and just told I

1402.26 --> 1410.66
just kept telling him like dude this is

1405.35 --> 1413.51
so overly in-your-face to go against

1410.66 --> 1415.19
this it's just beyond claiming gas

1413.51 --> 1418.84
pressure without a container because

1415.19 --> 1422.6000000000001
just like everything proves this

1418.84 --> 1425.57
everything proved that only solids can

1422.6 --> 1427.76
have their own self-sustaining magnet

1425.57 --> 1431.21
their own lasting magnetic field without

1427.76 --> 1433.94
ads outside influence and they just and

1431.21 --> 1436.8500000000001
they just said no and it was obviously

1433.94 --> 1439.1000000000001
personal because I was there in what

1436.85 --> 1442.49
they thought was their baller chat and

1439.1 --> 1446.78
they just said no you're an idiot it's

1442.49 --> 1451.81
like oh my god that's why I went full-on

1446.78 --> 1451.81
rage win cuz it's just so [ __ ] like

1452.23 --> 1459.53
it just felt like this guy needs just a

1455.36 --> 1462.6799999999998
brutal slapping to the face for his own

1459.53 --> 1464.45
good not because he's I hate him but

1462.68 --> 1469.3700000000001
just for his own good it's

1464.45 --> 1471.77
so stupid to go against that and I stole

1469.37 --> 1472.04
them like ya find me an example google

1471.77 --> 1475.1299999999999
it

1472.04 --> 1481.42
whatever ask a scientist as a physicist

1475.13 --> 1485.75
ask a chemist anyone get me that proof

1481.42 --> 1488.3000000000002
that and any non solid material can

1485.75 --> 1492.29
actually create its own magnetic field

1488.3 --> 1497.69
without outside influences and somebody

1492.29 --> 1499.85
did mention them also plasma and I don't

1497.69 --> 1501.92
know about that but I personally think

1499.85 --> 1505.85
that plasma doesn't really fall on their

1501.92 --> 1511.0700000000002
matter it kind of does but it's not

1505.85 --> 1514.9699999999998
molecular anymore it's not atom based if

1511.07 --> 1517.82
I'm not mistaken it's something else so

1514.97 --> 1521.51
I don't know about that I I don't know

1517.82 --> 1528.11
it does place my in it like a tube of

1521.51 --> 1530.6299999999999
plasma does that just have a magnetic

1528.11 --> 1533.6
field that comes out of that without

1530.63 --> 1535.8500000000001
anything else done with it does that I

1533.6 --> 1539.81
don't know I have no idea if that

1535.85 --> 1541.76
happens if it does then okay plasma does

1539.81 --> 1543.86
that maybe I don't know I

1541.76 --> 1549.74
they never elaborated on it but it might

1543.86 --> 1553.1299999999999
be but as for the atomic particles yeah

1549.74 --> 1555.47
the ones that are like still well that

1553.13 --> 1559.93
are not plasma that at least you could

1555.47 --> 1563.69
say there is no liquid there is no gas

1559.93 --> 1566.93
normal gas substance that in a natural

1563.69 --> 1571.0700000000002
state creates a detectable magnetic

1566.93 --> 1575.99
field it's only solid matter that does

1571.07 --> 1581.81
that and that was my entire point and

1575.99 --> 1584.93
I'm making it here now and yeah once you

1581.81 --> 1590.3
take once you take your reconcile with

1584.93 --> 1594.05
that as well then a molten iron core in

1590.3 --> 1596.519
whatever set up is just the molten part

1594.05 --> 1600.549
is only in the way

1596.519 --> 1603.57
and the funny thing is from side looks

1600.549 --> 1606.22
of what NASA supposedly figured out

1603.57 --> 1607.84
there sometimes these hints that they

1606.22 --> 1609.76
kind of figure it out like in there

1607.84 --> 1611.4399999999998
saying okay well maybe parts of it

1609.76 --> 1613.57
immortal but there's still this solid

1611.44 --> 1617.919
part that is actually doing the magnetic

1613.57 --> 1620.9399999999998
stuff so they're already sidestepping up

1617.919 --> 1625.51
because they know yeah

1620.94 --> 1629.94
only solids are capable of creating

1625.51 --> 1634.32
magnetic fields no spinning thing

1629.94 --> 1636.97
without extra influence from the outside

1634.32 --> 1638.95
that is like liquid or gas could ever

1636.97 --> 1642.84
create its own magnetic field so there

1638.95 --> 1645.3990000000001
has to be solid there in order to even

1642.84 --> 1649.269
theoretically create any kind of

1645.399 --> 1652.6
magnetism so just the old idea of molten

1649.269 --> 1654.789
iron car it's just outdated it's it's

1652.6 --> 1658.6589999999999
conceptual it's presupposition or many

1654.789 --> 1661.889
ways and it's physically impossible it's

1658.659 --> 1666.5490000000002
one of the most ridiculous fantasies

1661.889 --> 1672.49
from old all futurism heliocentrism and

1666.549 --> 1678.399
it's dumb it's really for the dumb like

1672.49 --> 1681.24
dumb science fiction and it's a miracle

1678.399 --> 1685.539
it just kept hanging in here for so long

1681.24 --> 1688.419
20 20 20 it's still probably gonna be in

1685.539 --> 1690.1589999999999
books can you imagine this age with

1688.419 --> 1695.289
everything in there's they're still

1690.159 --> 1698.5900000000001
putting that level of [ __ ] [ __ ]

1695.289 --> 1701.669
outdated futurism in in schoolbooks it's

1698.59 --> 1701.6689999999999
just so sad

1715.77 --> 1723.78
all right well Irena Colombo I did have

1720.51 --> 1730.1
physics class and I was pretty good at

1723.78 --> 1736.2
it and after that I I kind of stopped it

1730.1 --> 1738.6899999999998
because I don't know I think maybe

1736.2 --> 1742.44
because like the really good people were

1738.69 --> 1745.44
just dicks it weren't very nice to me or

1742.44 --> 1749.63
they were very low on empathy so I just

1745.44 --> 1755.3
didn't get along in that group of people

1749.63 --> 1757.8600000000001
and I kind of forgot about it and

1755.3 --> 1759.84
started yeah what basically happened

1757.86 --> 1766.59
after school is I kind of started to

1759.84 --> 1772.53
engage in in the ethereal and pursue

1766.59 --> 1774.6
things like try yeah spiritualism it's

1772.53 --> 1776.94
like yeah witchcraft but I've always

1774.6 --> 1780.36
been extremely cautious about like

1776.94 --> 1783.9
actually doing spells or anything like

1780.36 --> 1787.05
never I want to know stuff and I want to

1783.9 --> 1789.75
figure out what is that and what would

1787.05 --> 1793.05
the consequences be because it's really

1789.75 --> 1795.47
like magic using energy especially

1793.05 --> 1801.84
spells it's like a puzzle you're like

1795.47 --> 1804.27
rearranging strands of things and it's

1801.84 --> 1807.62
very dangerous potential oh well not

1804.27 --> 1816.66
it's not like deadly dangerous but it's

1807.62 --> 1818.9699999999998
very easy to yeah cause more harm on the

1816.66 --> 1822.17
long run then you get advantage on the

1818.97 --> 1827.16
short run it's something I've learned

1822.17 --> 1829.98
also from from yeah basically trying out

1827.16 --> 1837.72
certain things like really carefully

1829.98 --> 1839.85
carefully and in retrospect really most

1837.72 --> 1842.96
of like that type of witchcraft magic

1839.85 --> 1845.07
seems just completely useless to me

1842.96 --> 1851.6100000000001
because

1845.07 --> 1855.1399999999999
if I just do it more impulsively and

1851.61 --> 1859.4399999999998
just as the energy comes to me naturally

1855.14 --> 1863.13
then then just try to wield it properly

1859.44 --> 1865.98
as it arrives just get really good at

1863.13 --> 1867.7700000000002
just the you can feel weak whatever in

1865.98 --> 1871.5
just a moment the energy arise

1867.77 --> 1873.48
immediately wield it properly and try to

1871.5 --> 1874.02
get it something out of it to the

1873.48 --> 1875.94
fullest

1874.02 --> 1880.17
that's something I've been focusing on

1875.94 --> 1883.77
much more instead of just trying out two

1880.17 --> 1886.44
rituals and spells and so that is my

1883.77 --> 1890.06
conclusion to that research which is

1886.44 --> 1890.06
pretty much in my early 20s

1901.179 --> 1904.3300000000002
all right

1908.6 --> 1915.399
yeah but I did learn a lot I also like

1911.63 --> 1924.23
talked I most of my research was really

1915.399 --> 1926.75
speech based and like just trying to

1924.23 --> 1929.659
size up and analyze people that were

1926.75 --> 1932.679
involved in that kind of thing some

1929.659 --> 1936.2
characters were even kind of dubious

1932.679 --> 1938.269
like I get gut feeling like they there

1936.2 --> 1944.21
was something dark about them like yeah

1938.269 --> 1946.25
I bumped into those and and just tried

1944.21 --> 1948.95
not to make any enemies basically when

1946.25 --> 1950.72
that happened but if there were just too

1948.95 --> 1953.779
many of these people that had dark

1950.72 --> 1955.519
influences and they would then obviously

1953.779 --> 1958.159
have some kind of control that's just

1955.519 --> 1961.759
inevitable then eventually I just figure

1958.159 --> 1966.0490000000002
out okay this is not a this group is not

1961.759 --> 1969.679
pure enough I I can't stay it's yeah I

1966.049 --> 1973.61
can't attach myself to this and that

1969.679 --> 1975.5900000000001
happened well I guess every time every

1973.61 --> 1977.4499999999998
time I try to engage in some kind of

1975.59 --> 1980.9289999999999
group it was it like a little weaker

1977.45 --> 1986.69
circle which was kind of harmless at

1980.929 --> 1989.3600000000001
first and also like a meditation group I

1986.69 --> 1992.419
was a totally different direction very

1989.36 --> 1996.08
new age and like every group I tried

1992.419 --> 1998.509
that way and always eventually some kind

1996.08 --> 2001.21
of corruption came out it was like okay

1998.509 --> 2006.009
we're comfortable enough now to show

2001.21 --> 2009.22
what is in us and then really freaky

2006.009 --> 2011.289
[ __ ] comes out and everybody's all being

2009.22 --> 2012.309
all tolerant and I'm like that is just

2011.289 --> 2017.32
not good

2012.309 --> 2019.24
why aren't you judging and just saying

2017.32 --> 2022.899
like hold on this what you're doing

2019.24 --> 2026.049
right now it's just that's not okay and

2022.899 --> 2027.7589999999998
and they're not talking about violent

2026.049 --> 2029.86
things because yeah people would go

2027.759 --> 2031.809
violent then obviously there would be

2029.86 --> 2035.9189999999999
immediate responses it's all too obvious

2031.809 --> 2040.059
but just even just like really dark

2035.919 --> 2041.43
things or it's very hard to describe but

2040.059 --> 2045.96
it's just like

2041.43 --> 2048.87
a bad way of conducting yourself

2045.96 --> 2053.55
socially and thinking about things in an

2048.87 --> 2057.54
immoral way and then not people not

2053.55 --> 2060.8900000000003
dealing with that not pointing out for

2057.54 --> 2064.71
what it is and that happened to me

2060.89 --> 2072.06
everywhere everywhere it's really my

2064.71 --> 2075.54
biggest disappointment so although yeah

2072.06 --> 2078.62
here on the flat earth platform and

2075.54 --> 2082.98
everything I'm glad that I can at least

2078.62 --> 2086.1
speak out about it it's not like okay I

2082.98 --> 2090.69
have to behave or I'm not welcome

2086.1 --> 2093.149
anymore it's the Internet it's kind of

2090.69 --> 2095.82
like normalized to really throw things

2093.149 --> 2099.48
out there be much more confronting so I

2095.82 --> 2103.23
can now just do it without immediately

2099.48 --> 2107.13
being shown the door and I'm glad of it

2103.23 --> 2108.69
I'm yeah I'm glad now I'm not

2107.13 --> 2112.2000000000003
disappointed with the flat earth

2108.69 --> 2116.64
movement it's more the things before

2112.2 --> 2121.71
Flat Earth groups different types of

2116.64 --> 2126.27
people and there would be good things

2121.71 --> 2130.4700000000003
about everyone but just the group way of

2126.27 --> 2133.65
dealing with things it just seems wrong

2130.47 --> 2141.74
everywhere to me I don't know what that

2133.65 --> 2141.7400000000002
is maybe I am just overly critical

2143.32 --> 2168.31
I don't know what it is but yeah

2160.89 --> 2174.16
nowadays if that kind of [ __ ] happens I

2168.31 --> 2176.56
will damn well respond to it unless like

2174.16 --> 2178.6299999999997
the tension is super-high and I in

2176.56 --> 2183.7
danger like literally becoming in the

2178.63 --> 2186.28
crosshairs of an assault then I have to

2183.7 --> 2190.12
really size up the level of tension and

2186.28 --> 2193.84
how to break it because yeah breaking

2190.12 --> 2198.0699999999997
tension in a fart a fight that might be

2193.84 --> 2200.8
about to start can be very difficult you

2198.07 --> 2202.69
have to hit the right snare you have to

2200.8 --> 2204.82
really snap them out of it in the right

2202.69 --> 2214.15
way and all depends on the type of

2204.82 --> 2216.7000000000003
pension yeah but yeah nowadays I don't

2214.15 --> 2221.08
know I would engage with groups if it

2216.7 --> 2223.3599999999997
just feels right at first and that

2221.08 --> 2226.21
really depends on my impression of the

2223.36 --> 2228.76
persons the people that I would then be

2226.21 --> 2232.42
invited by that energy doesn't is it

2228.76 --> 2235.5400000000004
good and I'll go with it but it oh I

2232.42 --> 2237.94
really do get invited for things I don't

2235.54 --> 2239.95
know maybe it's just because I'm kind of

2237.94 --> 2243.16
out looking like who would want to

2239.95 --> 2244.72
invite the matrix guy I don't know if

2243.16 --> 2248.46
they really got to know me they would

2244.72 --> 2248.4599999999996
most people don't even do that

2249.069 --> 2259.449
I don't know maybe I'm just in general

2254.469 --> 2261.2490000000003
not very and gauging I don't know it's

2259.449 --> 2263.0190000000002
like even when I get groceries I have

2261.249 --> 2268.0589999999997
this tendency to just keep it super

2263.019 --> 2270.64
basic just be nice be smiling or not

2268.059 --> 2273.539
artificially so maybe talk something

2270.64 --> 2277.719
superficial and just keep to that never

2273.539 --> 2281.7290000000003
never be like hey you I don't know I

2277.719 --> 2285.13
don't even really know how to anymore

2281.729 --> 2288.729
unless I had like this real specific

2285.13 --> 2292.509
Drive or vision concerning a certain

2288.729 --> 2296.009
person or if they'd like engage with me

2292.509 --> 2296.009
and it just clicks

2300.92 --> 2308.42
socializing has become kind of complex

2303.72 --> 2311.97
to me just keep at it

2308.42 --> 2315.839
and at least I'm not shy to talk anymore

2311.97 --> 2317.759
that's good like I'd be hesitant to talk

2315.839 --> 2320.16
to certain people because I think that's

2317.759 --> 2323.549
probably not gonna work out with the

2320.16 --> 2325.89
level they're at but I'm not gonna be

2323.549 --> 2329.759
not talking because I'm not confident

2325.89 --> 2335.48
about myself because better ya better

2329.759 --> 2335.48
watch out I am I'm freakin confident I

2337.43 --> 2347.0589999999997
know who I am I know what I can do and I

2342.809 --> 2347.059
will not surrender or give up

2354.309 --> 2357.309
yeah

2374.2 --> 2381.8199999999997
right yeah love wisdom harmony breaking

2377.14 --> 2383.5299999999997
tension not I was in this case when I

2381.82 --> 2386.71
talked about breaking tension I meant

2383.53 --> 2391.69
specifically between two people who are

2386.71 --> 2393.94
about to like get really pissed off at

2391.69 --> 2396.85
one another that kind of tension because

2393.94 --> 2401.05
just tension as in who everybody is

2396.85 --> 2404.5899999999997
nervous if I find myself in a space with

2401.05 --> 2406.57
people that then get that nerve it's

2404.59 --> 2408.67
very simple I look around I see

2406.57 --> 2414.04
everybody okay is everybody in that

2408.67 --> 2416.2000000000003
nerve right then I claim alpha it's very

2414.04 --> 2417.94
easy actually to me it's very simple

2416.2 --> 2421.24
then I start to break the tension and

2417.94 --> 2423.73
just say like yeah well it's very silent

2421.24 --> 2427.3599999999997
here maybe we could like have a

2423.73 --> 2429.46
conversation or something if if we are

2427.36 --> 2431.44
supposed to if everybody's just sits

2429.46 --> 2433.54
like in a cafeteria or something yeah

2431.44 --> 2436.2000000000003
it's not gonna do that because people

2433.54 --> 2439.06
are just gonna be busy doing whatever

2436.2 --> 2441.73
but if you're supposed to then I have no

2439.06 --> 2444.27
problem engaging in contact but that is

2441.73 --> 2448.9900000000002
the thing it's like is it supposed to

2444.27 --> 2454.11
the setting of a scenario for me is

2448.99 --> 2457.87
extremely important it's weird it's

2454.11 --> 2460.0
maybe that's like an Asian thing because

2457.87 --> 2461.98
I still have some genetics from that

2460.0 --> 2466.9
side maybe that it's that it's like the

2461.98 --> 2469.48
the purpose of you what you're gonna be

2466.9 --> 2473.11
doing in a location what is what are you

2469.48 --> 2475.27
supposed to be doing that angle to me is

2473.11 --> 2478.09
extremely important for my social

2475.27 --> 2480.88
engaging of people because if I just

2478.09 --> 2484.03
come wandering in somewhere and I don't

2480.88 --> 2488.1400000000003
know it then I don't really know what

2484.03 --> 2489.88
I'm doing except for getting to know the

2488.14 --> 2492.0099999999998
place and that doesn't really involve

2489.88 --> 2494.32
people except if they're like people

2492.01 --> 2496.1200000000003
that are like in a food stand and

2494.32 --> 2498.67
they're always there because then they

2496.12 --> 2499.33
become a little anchored part of that

2498.67 --> 2501.94
scenario

2499.33 --> 2503.68
it's a weird way of and going at things

2501.94 --> 2505.84
I guess for a lot of people that just

2503.68 --> 2506.74
naturally bump into people start talking

2505.84 --> 2512.9100000000003
maybe

2506.74 --> 2516.1299999999997
but this is how I do think the angle to

2512.91 --> 2519.1299999999997
what I'm so but I'm gonna be doing there

2516.13 --> 2521.23
what the purpose is matters everything

2519.13 --> 2523.78
to how I socially engage in people and

2521.23 --> 2525.849
if I can even do that like if there's a

2523.78 --> 2530.9500000000003
class for example if I'd go to like a

2525.849 --> 2535.089
course then there is suddenly a group

2530.95 --> 2537.97
setting and I will take that on to

2535.089 --> 2541.21
immediately start group bonding but not

2537.97 --> 2545.3489999999997
like in a superficial stupid way but

2541.21 --> 2548.83
just by being very confident and just be

2545.349 --> 2553.54
be like colleagues it's suddenly a modus

2548.83 --> 2556.27
a a system a purpose that I can grab in

2553.54 --> 2558.88
that scenario and the energies will fall

2556.27 --> 2561.609
in place and suddenly I am doing that

2558.88 --> 2564.849
and that's how I've always done things

2561.609 --> 2568.38
the purpose to what I'm supposed to be

2564.849 --> 2571.4500000000003
doing matters everything for my social

2568.38 --> 2574.53
interactions everything because if I

2571.45 --> 2577.9199999999996
just keep come in wandering in somewhere

2574.53 --> 2581.65
then I don't know what I'm doing there I

2577.92 --> 2583.03
don't know yeah I get a lot more nervous

2581.65 --> 2584.83
I don't really know how to approach

2583.03 --> 2589.3
people but if I'm actually doing

2584.83 --> 2592.0299999999997
something specific then I got a platform

2589.3 --> 2594.67
to engage people in through that

2592.03 --> 2596.9700000000003
platform I don't know that's just how I

2594.67 --> 2601.03
work it's how I work best

2596.97 --> 2603.04
so technically having a job having a

2601.03 --> 2604.8100000000004
function at that would even help me

2603.04 --> 2606.91
because suddenly like yeah I I'm

2604.81 --> 2609.339
supposed to be doing something here and

2606.91 --> 2611.41
then as I do that I certainly have

2609.339 --> 2616.9
reference points and I can engage people

2611.41 --> 2619.14
as a person doing that weird isn't it

2616.9 --> 2625.119
[Music]

2619.14 --> 2627.4
shut up John Jason it's just stop

2625.119 --> 2629.29
spamming the same [ __ ] over and over

2627.4 --> 2633.27
again I'm not gonna be a freakin [ __ ]

2629.29 --> 2633.27
caver I'm sick of your spam

2659.27 --> 2672.44
all right I completely lost track of ya

2670.18 --> 2676.8799999999997
don't know what's been happening in Chad

2672.44 --> 2684.32
but yeah I've just went on and on and on

2676.88 --> 2689.4500000000003
talking Moringa no no no Jessica I

2684.32 --> 2693.46
haven't tried that I I should I should

2689.45 --> 2693.46
see if there's something like that

2698.2 --> 2704.98
anyway yeah poof fifty nine watching

2701.9 --> 2704.98
lots of people I know

2721.33 --> 2731.8199999999997
ce o--'s a pirate David Reed Howard more

2732.63 --> 2738.57
DK black Ian Adams

2743.41 --> 2747.72
Tom annoyed okay

2750.41 --> 2755.87
so yeah you know what enough about

2752.57 --> 2757.7000000000003
social interaction talks you know might

2755.87 --> 2759.3199999999997
get a bit tedious after a while so if

2757.7 --> 2761.7999999999997
there's anything specifically Flat Earth

2759.32 --> 2769.2200000000003
related you want to discuss

2761.8 --> 2776.9900000000002
we still got like 10 minutes you know or

2769.22 --> 2777.89
if somebody wants to come on my panel or

2776.99 --> 2780.35
oh yeah

2777.89 --> 2783.3799999999997
I must forgot I was gonna kind of do a

2780.35 --> 2787.0099999999998
presentation a bit about YouTube's

2783.38 --> 2789.9500000000003
policy I just wanted to share it just

2787.01 --> 2792.6400000000003
the new update because there have been

2789.95 --> 2802.04
some more updates yeah let's do that

2792.64 --> 2806.0299999999997
all right so the hate speech policy had

2802.04 --> 2808.73
left a veil got off and I shared this

2806.03 --> 2811.61
link even had videos where he went over

2808.73 --> 2815.63
it and they've been changing it around

2811.61 --> 2817.4
like they've been like completely

2815.63 --> 2819.86
changing the text into new thing so I

2817.4 --> 2823.63
was just like okay maybe I should go to

2819.86 --> 2826.55
go over this with you guys again

2823.63 --> 2830.77
just to be on record you know I'm gonna

2826.55 --> 2836.63
go to full presentation mode like that

2830.77 --> 2843.04
so here's the the hate speech policy of

2836.63 --> 2848.51
YouTube and this went into effect 5 June

2843.04 --> 2851.18
this year right so hate speech is not

2848.51 --> 2854.15
allowed on YouTube we've remove content

2851.18 --> 2856.64
promoting violets or hatred against

2854.15 --> 2862.84
individuals or grouped based on any of

2856.64 --> 2867.2799999999997
the following attributes age caste okay

2862.84 --> 2874.76
disability ethnicity gender identity

2867.28 --> 2880.9300000000003
okay nationality race immigration status

2874.76 --> 2884.6600000000003
religion sex gender like

2880.93 --> 2887.72
okay that so is are they basically

2884.66 --> 2891.17
saying that gender identity and sex /

2887.72 --> 2895.79
gender are two different things that is

2891.17 --> 2902.03
just do they mean like then gender

2895.79 --> 2904.64
identity is like okay well we're all we

2902.03 --> 2908.0600000000004
all have the gender identity of raccoons

2904.64 --> 2911.54
and this guy's a dolphin and we don't

2908.06 --> 2914.7799999999997
like dolphins so we're gonna exclude him

2911.54 --> 2919.46
is that gender identity hate speech is

2914.78 --> 2923.9
that what they mean because when sex

2919.46 --> 2927.31
gender hate speech I'd guess it's like

2923.9 --> 2933.7400000000002
okay we will guys are only stupid women

2927.31 --> 2935.63
or that or where it goes only and we

2933.74 --> 2936.2
hate men or that's probably not gonna

2935.63 --> 2938.7200000000003
happen

2936.2 --> 2942.5299999999997
because that's normal I don't know maybe

2938.72 --> 2944.48
they will with who knows we this is just

2942.53 --> 2950.75
so over the place so maybe that's about

2944.48 --> 2953.21
the actual yeah genetic sexual nature as

2950.75 --> 2957.29
it were but it's funny that they would

2953.21 --> 2961.16
designate it separately anyway

2957.29 --> 2962.56
oh yeah sexual orientation so like what

2961.16 --> 2965.99
turns you on

2962.56 --> 2968.66
that's something else entirely so if

2965.99 --> 2972.08
yeah somebody gets turned on by a

2968.66 --> 2974.41
certain type of person and you make fun

2972.08 --> 2974.41
of that

2977.95 --> 2983.77
that's really tough cuz I don't know

2984.069 --> 2989.42
making fun hate speech right maybe it's

2987.23 --> 2991.609
not just making fun of because yeah

2989.42 --> 2994.46
making fun is just making fun I mean I

2991.609 --> 2997.63
guess it this is just like genuine

2994.46 --> 3000.19
homophobia or rather like oh we don't

2997.63 --> 3001.119
get rid of them all that type of

3000.19 --> 3003.73
nonsense

3001.119 --> 3008.589
I got like you know in a certain sense

3003.73 --> 3012.01
I'm kind of homophobic technically but I

3008.589 --> 3014.109
don't want to like oh I would never want

3012.01 --> 3016.2400000000002
to see a person again no it's just like

3014.109 --> 3018.67
just don't get in my freaking face and

3016.24 --> 3024.1299999999997
it'll be alright you know and don't push

3018.67 --> 3027.76
it on kids so right that's in there and

3024.13 --> 3030.25
then victims of major violent event and

3027.76 --> 3035.0490000000004
their kin well that makes them well

3030.25 --> 3038.44
sense of course if if there's actual

3035.049 --> 3041.349
proof that such a major violent event is

3038.44 --> 3045.43
real so there comes complicated because

3041.349 --> 3047.289
yeah it's just accepted by the media

3045.43 --> 3050.549
that something is real does that mean

3047.289 --> 3053.5890000000004
that you can not target those people

3050.549 --> 3059.92
with doubts does that is that where it

3053.589 --> 3063.52
stands for I don't know it's not as

3059.92 --> 3065.859
specific as like oh anyway let's just

3063.52 --> 3066.609
move on with this before takes another

3065.859 --> 3070.0589999999997
half hour

3066.609 --> 3072.94
so veteran status okay evading veteran

3070.059 --> 3077.3190000000004
status well that yeah

3072.94 --> 3083.71
can't say I disagree to that it's no

3077.319 --> 3086.14
reason to hate on veterans if you see

3083.71 --> 3090.16
content that violates this policy please

3086.14 --> 3093.8799999999997
report it instructions for reporting

3090.16 --> 3098.0789999999997
violence violations of our community

3093.88 --> 3102.19
guidelines are available if you have

3098.079 --> 3105.099
found multiple video comments or a user

3102.19 --> 3109.119
entire channel that you wish to report

3105.099 --> 3111.4300000000003
please visit our reporting tool where

3109.119 --> 3114.55
you will be able to submit a mordy

3111.43 --> 3120.54
tilt complaint goodie well we know how

3114.55 --> 3123.76
that works so if if I'm posting content

3120.54 --> 3126.94
don't post content on YouTube if the

3123.76 --> 3129.9700000000003
purpose of that content is to do one or

3126.94 --> 3132.4
more of the following and courage

3129.97 --> 3139.6299999999997
violence against individuals or groups

3132.4 --> 3142.63
based on any off on on any off on the

3139.63 --> 3145.9
attribute nice spelling there noted

3142.63 --> 3149.65
above we don't allow threats on YouTube

3145.9 --> 3153.51
and we treat implied calls for violence

3149.65 --> 3158.079
as real threats okay okay

3153.51 --> 3160.4500000000003
can't argue with that really but ya know

3158.079 --> 3165.46
depends on what is a real threat for

3160.45 --> 3168.52
violence it's like being sneaky like

3165.46 --> 3170.5
referencing something that has some kind

3168.52 --> 3173.319
of angle to a violent thing is that a

3170.5 --> 3175.21
threat of violence or is it just

3173.319 --> 3177.8089999999997
referencing something that could have

3175.21 --> 3181.2400000000002
been potentially violent I don't know

3177.809 --> 3183.4900000000002
we'll see where that goes anyway the

3181.24 --> 3185.68
next one is inside hatred against

3183.49 --> 3190.359
individuals or groups based on any of

3185.68 --> 3193.6299999999997
the attributes noted above right so

3190.359 --> 3197.65
hatred you can't talk about that you

3193.63 --> 3205.1400000000003
don't like something so you can only

3197.65 --> 3208.869
talk about things if you love it that's

3205.14 --> 3213.9
that's quite useless it's not gonna

3208.869 --> 3213.9
leave a lot anyway

3216.12 --> 3221.98
examples here are some X is an example

3219.55 --> 3225.82
here are examples of hate speech not

3221.98 --> 3228.19
allowed on YouTube I'm glad this pilot

3225.82 --> 3229.03
event happened they got what they

3228.19 --> 3231.2200000000003
deserved

3229.03 --> 3234.6400000000003
referring to persons with the attributes

3231.22 --> 3237.4599999999996
noted as above right well yeah that's

3234.64 --> 3239.08
just stupid troll so I don't know who

3237.46 --> 3241.36
would want to watch a video with

3239.08 --> 3241.93
somebody do it saying things like that

3241.36 --> 3246.04
anyway

3241.93 --> 3247.7799999999997
they're total dicks but yeah it's not

3246.04 --> 3252.55
gonna be left to that and I can assure

3247.78 --> 3253.3
you it's just a very blatant example I

3252.55 --> 3255.82
guess okay

3253.3 --> 3260.1400000000003
person with attributes not above our

3255.82 --> 3265.9900000000002
dogs or person with attributes not above

3260.14 --> 3271.96
our like animals okay so you can't draw

3265.99 --> 3276.0899999999997
metaphors hmm but what if the metaphor

3271.96 --> 3279.43
can be like explained in detail like

3276.09 --> 3282.01
okay not necessarily like oh dogs must

3279.43 --> 3284.02
be evil but what if you just attribute

3282.01 --> 3286.8700000000003
the behavior of a certain group of

3284.02 --> 3293.35
people to like how dogs typically behave

3286.87 --> 3296.5299999999997
in packs would it then not be of just a

3293.35 --> 3299.43
viable comparison would it be hate

3296.53 --> 3303.13
speech just comparing it I don't know

3299.43 --> 3304.87
maybe I'm just being nitpicky here but

3303.13 --> 3310.84
yeah you gotta be nitpicky with this

3304.87 --> 3313.21
kind of weird autocratic censorship what

3310.84 --> 3317.08
happens when content violates this

3313.21 --> 3320.11
policy if your content violates this

3317.08 --> 3323.16
policy will remove the content and send

3320.11 --> 3326.2000000000003
you an email to let you know thank you

3323.16 --> 3328.42
if this is the first time you've posted

3326.2 --> 3330.46
content and violates Community

3328.42 --> 3334.36
Guidelines you'll get a warning with no

3330.46 --> 3337.48
penalty to your channel if it's not will

3334.36 --> 3339.2200000000003
issue a strike against your channel your

3337.48 --> 3342.91
channel will be terminated if you

3339.22 --> 3346.68
receive three strikes learn more about

3342.91 --> 3355.41
the strike system right

3346.68 --> 3359.8799999999997
was this article helpful I guess alright

3355.41 --> 3359.8799999999997
so yeah goody

3363.42 --> 3377.1
so now now you know that was the update

3371.97 --> 3389.8599999999997
to the hate speech policy of YouTube

3377.1 --> 3394.63
very informative so yeah we'll just see

3389.86 --> 3396.73
how nitpicky they're gonna get like are

3394.63 --> 3399.13
they gonna retro actively dig through

3396.73 --> 3402.73
material and then just see like oh my

3399.13 --> 3405.58
god Arwen like half a year ago at this

3402.73 --> 3409.57
time where he just said like oh my god

3405.58 --> 3412.27
we must kill the pedophiles that [ __ ]

3409.57 --> 3413.9500000000003
and then kind of like in the middle of

3412.27 --> 3415.81
that raid started like no no I don't

3413.95 --> 3419.5499999999997
mean literally all of them it just mean

3415.81 --> 3424.0
do the ones that actually are savage

3419.55 --> 3426.55
child murderers and [ __ ] so are they

3424.0 --> 3429.91
gonna go after that video I the weird

3426.55 --> 3433.9
thing is I never got a strike I never

3429.91 --> 3437.74
got a warning for not even an email like

3433.9 --> 3440.32
hey thank you for yeah providing us with

3437.74 --> 3443.5499999999997
content for the last two and a half

3440.32 --> 3446.67
years we really appreciate all your work

3443.55 --> 3453.8500000000004
could you please not do that again

3446.67 --> 3458.64
nope nothing nothing nothing okay sure

3453.85 --> 3461.85
I guess I guess I'm okay with them

3458.64 --> 3461.85

3560.84 --> 3563.98
I'm all good

3568.01 --> 3580.13
oh oh yeah and umbrella ties I mean

3571.99 --> 3586.4799999999996
Brenda c.c enabled enable any bolts

3580.13 --> 3586.48
monetization enables hmm

3601.15 --> 3608.15
so yeah I'm gonna round out the show I

3605.08 --> 3611.45
hope it was good enough for you guys and

3608.15 --> 3616.01
gals I thought it was pretty interesting

3611.45 --> 3617.48
glad to have been able to put out some

3616.01 --> 3620.57
of these ideas I should really make

3617.48 --> 3623.09
notes more often especially like with

3620.57 --> 3629.4500000000003
Owen Benjamin because he brings up so

3623.09 --> 3631.73
many rich points that like I mentioned

3629.45 --> 3634.3999999999996
that I watch him but I barely mentioned

3631.73 --> 3636.26
even the direct in in content things

3634.4 --> 3639.4100000000003
because he treats so many good points

3636.26 --> 3641.69
and usually it's just the memes that

3639.41 --> 3644.6299999999997
stick and that I just then kind of

3641.69 --> 3646.4
repeat joke or something but I should

3644.63 --> 3648.62
really be taking more notes during his

3646.4 --> 3651.07
show because he just have has points

3648.62 --> 3656.9
that I can definitely elaborate on and

3651.07 --> 3660.17
expand upon as I tried today so I think

3656.9 --> 3664.13
that may be a good way for me to fish

3660.17 --> 3666.59
around and find speaking points for my

3664.13 --> 3671.21
program instead of literally improvising

3666.59 --> 3673.3700000000003
everything which I think I can do it

3671.21 --> 3676.0
I've proven that I can do it even over

3673.37 --> 3678.89
the course of weeks and weeks and weeks

3676.0 --> 3679.91
but I think it's getting kind of old

3678.89 --> 3681.98
even to me

3679.91 --> 3685.25
so I'm should be a little bit more

3681.98 --> 3687.77
focused it's like yeah I've proven I can

3685.25 --> 3690.68
improvise I proven that I can just do

3687.77 --> 3697.91
this every time even when I'm sick but I

3690.68 --> 3702.2
need to get my act together and start to

3697.91 --> 3706.1499999999996
get a bit more serious in in my I don't

3702.2 --> 3706.1499999999996
know any other word for it programming

3711.19 --> 3716.9500000000003
and yeah I don't have a team to guide me

3715.3 --> 3720.96
in this so I have to do it all by myself

3716.95 --> 3723.6699999999996
and that's just the way it's got to be

3720.96 --> 3726.46
even though I don't really like it and I

3723.67 --> 3729.7000000000003
would like to have a team that really

3726.46 --> 3732.34
like does the studio stuff as it were

3729.7 --> 3736.18
and I can just be running the program

3732.34 --> 3736.9500000000003
and do the talking and do my thing that

3736.18 --> 3739.87
will be great

3736.95 --> 3743.5299999999997
but yeah it's not gonna be that because

3739.87 --> 3745.6
I'm just a guy on social welfare sitting

3743.53 --> 3747.01
somewhere in a tidy room with a webcam

3745.6 --> 3751.0899999999997
and a computer and an internet

3747.01 --> 3755.38
connection and a microphone and I don't

3751.09 --> 3756.94
I don't have all that so I'm just gonna

3755.38 --> 3759.52
have to do it all by myself and that

3756.94 --> 3762.1
means I'm gonna have to do more then I

3759.52 --> 3764.89
would naturally even like to do because

3762.1 --> 3766.63
I'd like to keep it easy because that

3764.89 --> 3768.5499999999997
way can keep in the zone and I have to

3766.63 --> 3773.7400000000002
gonna put I've gonna have to push myself

3768.55 --> 3777.3100000000004
more and not fall out of the zone as I

3773.74 --> 3779.68
do it and it's kind of risky so who

3777.31 --> 3781.45
knows what's gonna happen but yeah I'm

3779.68 --> 3785.7599999999998
definitely gonna round out the show

3781.45 --> 3788.4399999999996
right now so thanks everyone for coming

3785.76 --> 3790.69

3811.57 --> 3819.1000000000004
to keep on growing and the county here

3815.68 --> 3822.6099999999997
is not making it easy for me so any

3819.1 --> 3825.69
support by you guys will help a lot it

3837.82 --> 3847.75
it's already started I think

3840.31 --> 3847.75
so until the next video keep it flat

3848.58 --> 3878.659
