100.259 --> 104.28
please keep it coming

102.9 --> 106.979
right

104.28 --> 110.1
whether today is

106.979 --> 113.0
beautiful although yeah

110.1 --> 113.0
trails

116.28 --> 121.979
very pronounce it Lee trails

119.939 --> 124.75899999999999
you'll really see them that often during

121.979 --> 124.759
this time anymore

124.979 --> 130.14
not really glad to see them back

128.52 --> 132.959
right

130.14 --> 136.51999999999998
so there is just beside that there is

132.959 --> 136.52
haze clouds out there

136.739 --> 142.8
in between the blue sky

139.379 --> 144.599
and there's a lot of wind I mean and

142.8 --> 147.18
that's great by the way although I had

144.599 --> 149.83999999999997
to install my plants in between the

147.18 --> 149.84
railing again

150.959 --> 155.58
because there is so much wind but that's

152.94 --> 159.42
really great actually because

155.58 --> 161.9
without it it would be really hot I bet

159.42 --> 161.89999999999998
right

162.3 --> 167.28
it's still plenty warm outside very

165.599 --> 171.66
plenty warm

167.28 --> 175.16
but since the wind is so constant yeah

171.66 --> 175.16
it's not scorching

175.5 --> 180.12
right

176.94 --> 182.42
so hello Dr utker first in chat good to

180.12 --> 182.42000000000002
see you

183.48 --> 189.17999999999998
it is Tuesday the 11th of July 2023.

201.06 --> 204.2
hello borders boy

204.36 --> 209.09900000000002
plant update oh yeah sure I was gonna

207.48 --> 211.73899999999998
[Music]

209.099 --> 217.73899999999998
the good oregano plant is like

211.739 --> 220.5
it now has like seven blooming shoots so

217.739 --> 224.12
it is like on full bloom

220.5 --> 224.12
which is fine I guess

231.78 --> 237.239
so I do think that just this massive

234.18 --> 238.98000000000002
heat it has overall been getting to it

237.239 --> 240.84
maybe that's the reason why it is

238.98 --> 244.379
blooming so elaborately

240.84 --> 246.54
right so yeah this whole flower stock is

244.379 --> 247.62
getting old there's still one blooming

246.54 --> 252.14
in there

247.62 --> 252.14000000000001
but in the meantime look at this

253.739 --> 258.6
one

255.9 --> 260.34000000000003
this one even two

258.6 --> 261.959
three

260.34 --> 263.58
four

261.959 --> 267.44
five

263.58 --> 267.44
six oh six new ones

270.6 --> 272.96000000000004
all right

273.6 --> 277.97900000000004
but

275.28 --> 280.73999999999995
the bees and all that are enjoying them

277.979 --> 283.88
I do see I so do see them actually

280.74 --> 283.88
attracting bees

284.58 --> 288.139
so that's fun

288.54 --> 293.28000000000003
right and there's still new shoots

291.12 --> 295.5
coming out so it seems like this plant's

293.28 --> 298.63899999999995
just doing just fine

295.5 --> 298.639
despite the Heat

313.639 --> 317.66
rosemary plants the same

317.94 --> 323.699
I mean Rosemary can take a lot of heat

320.1 --> 326.82000000000005
but not if the roots get too exposed and

323.699 --> 329.699
I basically this is too little this part

326.82 --> 331.5
is too small to properly protect the

329.699 --> 332.58
roots I think that that's really the

331.5 --> 335.94
problem

332.58 --> 337.85999999999996
now I have found a much bigger pot that

335.94 --> 338.82
I literally found by the side of the

337.86 --> 342.5
road

338.82 --> 347.46
a few days ago a really big one I mean

342.5 --> 349.979
this one is like this that part is this

347.46 --> 352.19899999999996
by this like that's a like a small

349.979 --> 355.25899999999996
bucket

352.199 --> 357.41900000000004
but of this type of pot with plenty of

355.259 --> 359.639
holes in the bottom I'm thinking of

357.419 --> 363.78
maybe trying to

359.639 --> 365.94
put this Rosemary in in that one

363.78 --> 368.88
because it's not going to blow over

365.94 --> 371.639
anymore and because it's so heavy

368.88 --> 374.46
because of all the the dirt that's going

371.639 --> 376.8
to be in there and maybe

374.46 --> 381.02
it'll like

376.8 --> 381.02000000000004
start to really live again

382.56 --> 389.1
not have like all these little leaves

385.52 --> 391.56
kind of dry up

389.1 --> 394.02000000000004
even though they're still new

391.56 --> 394.919
it's it's still young shoots coming out

394.02 --> 397.75899999999996
of it

394.919 --> 397.75899999999996
at the top

399.96 --> 405.08
right so yeah it's been great

422.34 --> 424.58
foreign

424.94 --> 430.08
parsley is crushing it

428.1 --> 432.0
it's funny they have these blue Parts

430.08 --> 435.59999999999997
recently

432.0 --> 438.539
but I mean this one yeah it it sucks up

435.6 --> 440.16
huge amounts of water every time I water

438.539 --> 443.52
it

440.16 --> 446.03900000000004
but seems to be doing great roots are

443.52 --> 449.65999999999997
very healthy in this one

446.039 --> 449.65999999999997
gave it plenty of extra

450.18 --> 453.18
biogro

454.5 --> 459.18
a couple of times

456.66 --> 461.40000000000003
and fantastic

459.18 --> 462.66
it's even kind of strong the leaves are

461.4 --> 464.63899999999995
pretty strong

462.66 --> 466.819
so that's cool let's just put it right

464.639 --> 466.819
here

473.52 --> 476.539
Coral listen

479.52 --> 482.12
foreign

484.259 --> 489.259
so yeah that one's doing great good

486.78 --> 489.25899999999996
purchase

498.72 --> 503.759
the old one is kind of starting to live

501.72 --> 505.86
back up a bit

503.759 --> 509.16
but I mean these ones are just not gonna

505.86 --> 512.76
get big you know that

509.16 --> 514.6800000000001
so I'm kind of leaving it alone

512.76 --> 518.279
I mean I did cut it down pretty

514.68 --> 521.4789999999999
dramatically like to like the last mini

518.279 --> 521.479
shoot coming out of it

521.52 --> 528.62
and yeah I'm just gonna leave it alone

524.279 --> 528.62
but it's still working just fine

530.399 --> 533.0
right

543.18 --> 549.06
now of course the younger

545.839 --> 552.5400000000001
bazo plant is

549.06 --> 553.92
it's blooming which I like I mean I'm

552.54 --> 555.48
not really gonna eat this one anymore

553.92 --> 557.459
now

555.48 --> 559.26
I mean I've been postponing making

557.459 --> 562.5
spaghetti

559.26 --> 564.12
for months so I guess

562.5 --> 566.459
if I want to make spaghetti I'm gonna

564.12 --> 568.68
have to get a new basil plant I feel

566.459 --> 570.3
like an old cat lady but with Dazzle

568.68 --> 574.3389999999999
plants

570.3 --> 574.3389999999999
uh it's a good thing you don't get

574.68 --> 582.06
cat ladies disease from these things

578.66 --> 584.519
but yeah it's blooming and it's strong

582.06 --> 587.3599999999999
it's doing better than the other one was

584.519 --> 587.36
at this stage

588.06 --> 593.2199999999999
I do think also the biogrow has helped

591.36 --> 596.48
it be

593.22 --> 596.48
grow up this strong

620.36 --> 628.98
and of course the older basil

625.44 --> 632.519
is like really shooting it off it's it's

628.98 --> 635.339
become so tall hey

632.519 --> 639.08
it's a little cricket

635.339 --> 639.08
The Crickets have been hanging around

642.48 --> 650.7
but uh yeah I mean it keeps going

647.399 --> 652.86
it's a lot of dry Leaf drying out on

650.7 --> 657.1400000000001
there but I mean it is hot and all that

652.86 --> 657.14
it's it's still very much alive

657.54 --> 663.0
there's some stalks here that haven't

660.839 --> 666.9200000000001
even gone into bloom and they had just

663.0 --> 666.92
that plenty of relief

667.74 --> 672.24
but yeah the older they get the harder

670.26 --> 675.18
those leaves get though

672.24 --> 679.339
they're when they're really young basil

675.18 --> 679.3389999999999
is much more luscious for consumption

679.44 --> 684.36
when they get older it's more about the

681.839 --> 688.32
smell there's something about old basil

684.36 --> 690.9590000000001
like because that etheric oil smell

688.32 --> 692.4590000000001
like it only becomes stronger when basil

690.959 --> 695.5189999999999
gets older

692.459 --> 698.6999999999999
I find that kind of interesting

695.519 --> 702.2
right but it had a lot of flowers had a

698.7 --> 702.2
lot of bees attracting it

703.98 --> 709.94
attracted to it

706.019 --> 709.94
so yeah still fun

739.38 --> 744.959
oh this is a

741.5 --> 748.98
five-legged Cricket apparently it's

744.959 --> 749.8199999999999
it's missing one pair of back leg it's

748.98 --> 753.839
very

749.82 --> 756.9200000000001
it probably can't jump then

753.839 --> 756.9200000000001
not aim

757.019 --> 761.42
poor thing

758.64 --> 764.66
oh well a little

761.42 --> 764.66
handicapped cricket

766.079 --> 770.88
doesn't seem to care though

768.54 --> 774.3199999999999
it's just

770.88 --> 774.32
having fun like a cricket

788.72 --> 795.62
right so that was it

791.7 --> 795.62
oh yeah the little oregano

800.639 --> 807.1800000000001
it has been doing the best itself but

804.839 --> 810.9590000000001
I mean

807.18 --> 813.54
it has also been riding up a lot and it

810.959 --> 815.459
seems to be like new green shoots coming

813.54 --> 818.279
out but I wonder how long it will take

815.459 --> 819.899
before they start to read up too so I

818.279 --> 822.68
don't know exactly whether it's like the

819.899 --> 822.68
soil or something

825.48 --> 830.339
but yeah but Yep this one seems to have

828.0 --> 832.8
trouble overall

830.339 --> 836.399
since the start

832.8 --> 840.1999999999999
it is very beautiful to look at though

836.399 --> 840.2
it's like this mini autumn

840.44 --> 845.4200000000001
and the smell is still very much oregano

853.94 --> 857.4200000000001
so that was it

857.94 --> 861.44
that was a plant update

861.53 --> 865.419
[Music]

871.92 --> 875.0
turn this up

880.56 --> 884.779
there we go oh please

885.24 --> 890.42
computer will stop blasting its fan so

888.18 --> 890.42
much

891.3 --> 895.9799999999999
because that noise is kind of like in my

893.279 --> 899.0
face yeah there you go

895.98 --> 901.98
always turn off background games

899.0 --> 904.98
don't keep them running

901.98 --> 904.98
anyway

911.779 --> 919.32
Moxie fiber oats dank Richard G

917.04 --> 922.399
Chris la jambe

919.32 --> 922.399
good to see you all

930.12 --> 935.66
rosemary roasted chicken good come yes I

932.88 --> 935.66
know borders boy

937.68 --> 943.6389999999999
I didn't know you were into that sort of

939.72 --> 943.639
knowledge I thought you were vegan

944.88 --> 947.6
what is this

950.699 --> 954.139
did you give up on that

955.92 --> 959.88
green fingers really

958.079 --> 962.12
well I thank you for the compliment

959.88 --> 965.76
borders boy but I mean

962.12 --> 968.76
it's not they're not that great

965.76 --> 972.079
I like them I I

968.76 --> 972.079
yeah but I mean

973.74 --> 979.1
well they're doing better than I

975.42 --> 979.0999999999999
personally expected they would

982.32 --> 987.36
cause like the balcony situation I've

985.079 --> 990.3
been not doing that for so long because

987.36 --> 993.36
I was thinking it would just

990.3 --> 997.3389999999999
become disastrous but it hasn't been

993.36 --> 997.339
that bad thus far

998.1 --> 1003.639
you're vegan but you were and all it is

1000.92 --> 1003.639
what

1006.62 --> 1010.12
okay but

1012.38 --> 1018.079
still very weird though to

1015.32 --> 1020.9590000000001
to a person that I got into argument

1018.079 --> 1025.52
over veganism with

1020.959 --> 1027.799
to then start to describe how

1025.52 --> 1030.26
how something is such a good combo with

1027.799 --> 1031.4
chicken I mean it's true but it's kind

1030.26 --> 1033.74
of weird

1031.4 --> 1037.299
makes me feel like you're you're not

1033.74 --> 1037.299
entirely sure about it

1040.52 --> 1046.8799999999999
apparently your veganism is not

1042.919 --> 1049.419
completely sealed then if you still have

1046.88 --> 1049.419
longings

1050.24 --> 1054.58
Rosemary with roasted veggies okay

1057.38 --> 1061.7
weren't vegan worst chicken with the

1059.48 --> 1065.44
Frozen yeah well I do that too that's

1061.7 --> 1065.44
very typically what I do too

1065.9 --> 1072.38
chicken legs

1068.24 --> 1075.16
with lots of salt pepper Rosemary

1072.38 --> 1075.16
in butter

1075.5 --> 1080.36
pure organic high quality butter and

1078.38 --> 1084.0800000000002
then just like

1080.36 --> 1085.3999999999999
strip the flesh off after it's first let

1084.08 --> 1087.6789999999999
it cook a bit

1085.4 --> 1090.98
and eventually went soft when it's

1087.679 --> 1094.24
pretty much done or almost done like

1090.98 --> 1094.24
strip it all off the bone

1094.34 --> 1099.9189999999999
cut it into little chunks and then put

1097.039 --> 1101.66
it back in in that Brew of butter and

1099.919 --> 1103.4
herbs

1101.66 --> 1106.4
and just let it

1103.4 --> 1106.4
slowly

1107.36 --> 1113.0
yes

1109.9 --> 1115.88
let it slowly stew in that

1113.0 --> 1118.34
and that combined with like broccoli or

1115.88 --> 1122.8600000000001
what do you call it the broccoli

1118.34 --> 1122.86
adjacent broccoli sticks as I call them

1123.32 --> 1129.26
it's like one of the best most

1126.26 --> 1130.82
nutritious meals possible

1129.26 --> 1133.58
like

1130.82 --> 1136.039
if I ate that I will literally feel it

1133.58 --> 1139.12
about my entire being like

1136.039 --> 1139.12
within the hour

1140.12 --> 1147.039
it's a massive boost on my skin on my

1143.12 --> 1147.039
overall feelings of well-being

1150.559 --> 1155.539
it's great

1152.96 --> 1159.16
but it's also the butter it's very

1155.539 --> 1159.16
important the butter factor in that

1160.22 --> 1166.299
anyway

1162.26 --> 1166.299
yeah I had that what was it

1167.059 --> 1171.1399999999999
I think two days ago or three days ago

1169.039 --> 1173.179
so yeah still have it fresh in the

1171.14 --> 1174.98
memory

1173.179 --> 1178.179
uh

1174.98 --> 1178.179
a more colored

1183.32 --> 1190.8799999999999
yeah the gerund thing right yeah yeah

1187.46 --> 1193.88
that was released yesterday on

1190.88 --> 1196.7600000000002
on a premiere

1193.88 --> 1200.48
it was pure after show five yeah guys

1196.76 --> 1202.22
over five hours

1200.48 --> 1206.48
all together

1202.22 --> 1212.26
crazy long but I mean Jaren that display

1206.48 --> 1212.26
with matoune was it was truly absurd

1212.32 --> 1216.34
it was truly absurd

1219.919 --> 1224.8600000000001
finally you got the break of the heat

1221.78 --> 1224.86
yeah good good and you

1225.5 --> 1229.94
over here too

1227.66 --> 1232.419
what is the temperature I haven't looked

1229.94 --> 1232.419
it up yet

1234.62 --> 1239.6789999999999
28 degrees is still hot 28 degrees

1244.91 --> 1248.059
[Music]

1250.039 --> 1254.84
say hello jiren

1252.799 --> 1258.4
Maybe

1254.84 --> 1258.3999999999999
or just dementia

1259.28 --> 1262.6
it could also

1263.179 --> 1268.16
but it could be that he just kind of

1266.539 --> 1272.12
like

1268.16 --> 1275.059
just try to get friendly and just

1272.12 --> 1276.3799999999999
it's like strategical cooking sort of

1275.059 --> 1280.22
but

1276.38 --> 1283.46
if that is what he aimed for he took it

1280.22 --> 1286.1000000000001
so overboard that he lost it all and

1283.46 --> 1288.6200000000001
that's when without really giving any

1286.1 --> 1293.48
sign of realization of that

1288.62 --> 1293.4799999999998
so the whole thing is just absurd

1297.559 --> 1302.799
it's absurd but he did

1300.26 --> 1302.799
there

1307.94 --> 1311.78
but I truly wonder if he even thought of

1310.52 --> 1314.059
it as

1311.78 --> 1316.6399999999999
as terrible as it was it could be

1314.059 --> 1318.74
literally appearance just out of it

1316.64 --> 1320.72
it's just that he's losing and he's

1318.74 --> 1324.6200000000001
losing his senses I don't think he was

1320.72 --> 1326.84
ever very high strung on his sensories

1324.62 --> 1331.4189999999999
in the first instance he always seemed a

1326.84 --> 1331.4189999999999
bit dim is what you call that

1334.34 --> 1343.84
but still capable communicator

1338.36 --> 1343.84
but I mean this is this is absurd I mean

1344.12 --> 1349.2199999999998
like why the [ __ ] would you give a [ __ ]

1347.48 --> 1352.4
about

1349.22 --> 1355.82
Ballers using an argument of a squashed

1352.4 --> 1357.3200000000002
Horizon and then he talks with mctoon

1355.82 --> 1361.22
about that

1357.32 --> 1364.58
in detail even discussing the cameras

1361.22 --> 1366.559
and its quirks the old cap for [ __ ]

1364.58 --> 1369.6789999999999
hours

1366.559 --> 1372.6789999999999
an hour it's crazy

1369.679 --> 1374.659
it's [ __ ] insane man like why the

1372.679 --> 1378.7
[ __ ] would you do that unless you were

1374.659 --> 1378.7
like secretly brothers or something

1380.84 --> 1387.08
unless like he and mctoon are in some

1383.0 --> 1390.14
secret weird little occult Club

1387.08 --> 1391.52
but I mean that yeah let's really picked

1390.14 --> 1394.7
that out of nowhere I don't think that

1391.52 --> 1398.9189999999999
that's the case I mean is it that would

1394.7 --> 1398.919
that that would be Beyond absurd

1399.5 --> 1404.72
and I mean like I don't think I don't

1402.38 --> 1407.419
know I don't care the point is the whole

1404.72 --> 1408.94
thing was just ridiculous

1407.419 --> 1413.72
and

1408.94 --> 1415.88
not good not good for jiren as a his

1413.72 --> 1417.799
reputation as a flat earther

1415.88 --> 1422.48
so

1417.799 --> 1426.08
suspicious yes it is definitely

1422.48 --> 1428.16
but I wouldn't draw any rigorous

1426.08 --> 1431.7089999999998
conclusions just yet

1428.16 --> 1431.709
[Music]

1431.72 --> 1435.6200000000001
anyway

1433.52 --> 1437.84
and I think if he's done so much his

1435.62 --> 1440.12
thing he would probably just say it at

1437.84 --> 1443.32
some point

1440.12 --> 1443.32
anyway cheers

1453.74 --> 1457.1
you know what the funniest thing about

1455.48 --> 1460.179
this is

1457.1 --> 1464.4399999999998
like it like always

1460.179 --> 1464.44
instantaneously helps my eyesight

1465.86 --> 1469.1789999999999
it's like a

1470.24 --> 1474.6200000000001
glasses or a gay prevention drug it's

1473.72 --> 1478.6000000000001
like

1474.62 --> 1478.6
drink this and you're just like

1478.76 --> 1483.02
just like that

1480.14 --> 1485.419
what is that drink it's Gusto dude I've

1483.02 --> 1487.1
been drinking this for months on the

1485.419 --> 1490.94
show

1487.1 --> 1493.28
I've introduced this years ago

1490.94 --> 1497.26
it's Gusto energy drink it's sort of

1493.28 --> 1497.26
like a collab but it isn't a cola

1498.32 --> 1501.76
apple juice based

1502.94 --> 1508.46
with a lot of botanic or herbs lemon

1506.0 --> 1509.659
juice concentrate it's like it's just a

1508.46 --> 1512.48
typical drink

1509.659 --> 1514.159
but yeah the herbal concentrate is like

1512.48 --> 1515.48
ginseng

1514.159 --> 1518.6000000000001
of like

1515.48 --> 1521.24
all of it just all the ginseng in the

1518.6 --> 1524.12
world is in this

1521.24 --> 1525.919
not lit but like all types there's so

1524.12 --> 1528.3799999999999
many different like I can't read this by

1525.919 --> 1530.3600000000001
the way this is just a possibly small

1528.38 --> 1533.0
not without my Loop

1530.36 --> 1535.1
even having Drank in this

1533.0 --> 1537.08
even having drank this I still can't

1535.1 --> 1539.779
read this because it's just this is

1537.08 --> 1544.26
painful

1539.779 --> 1547.36
but it's mostly a lot of ginseng

1544.26 --> 1550.4
[Music]

1547.36 --> 1553.039
and I only drink like one of these a day

1550.4 --> 1555.8600000000001
by the way on the show

1553.039 --> 1557.84
like I could be tempted to drink more of

1555.86 --> 1560.779
it but I think that would not

1557.84 --> 1562.779
be good for me if I did that

1560.779 --> 1562.779
um

1566.84 --> 1574.82
just came back last week oh

1570.799 --> 1577.539
okay I think I I drank these even years

1574.82 --> 1577.539
ago mark

1577.58 --> 1583.58
but this Gusto energy drink

1580.1 --> 1587.12
really nice label I like that

1583.58 --> 1589.3999999999999
and yeah

1587.12 --> 1592.059
it's just a special energy drink it's

1589.4 --> 1592.0590000000002
the good stuff

1602.419 --> 1608.0
do not watch in secret

1604.94 --> 1611.3200000000002
when you view it all right

1608.0 --> 1611.32
yeah I'm like that too

1622.279 --> 1627.14
you do not get that many Subs without me

1624.86 --> 1628.76
what are you talking about in that

1627.14 --> 1631.22
are you talking about jiren because

1628.76 --> 1634.4
that's not very reasonable

1631.22 --> 1638.179
Jaren grew very big

1634.4 --> 1641.419
because of all the work he did early on

1638.179 --> 1643.4
he was a first waiver and he he brought

1641.419 --> 1645.3200000000002
all of it

1643.4 --> 1648.679
like everything that was back then he

1645.32 --> 1650.779
was like on top of that Hill

1648.679 --> 1655.179
for a while

1650.779 --> 1655.179
until things got more technical

1658.58 --> 1663.02
I guess he's just never caught on

1661.1 --> 1665.0
with that

1663.02 --> 1667.039
he's never he's not a guy that just

1665.0 --> 1669.62
watches flatters debate because he wants

1667.039 --> 1673.12
to understand that argumentation he just

1669.62 --> 1673.12
doesn't do that I think

1675.14 --> 1680.419
do people drink Monster energy drinks in

1678.799 --> 1683.539
the net yeah

1680.419 --> 1685.96
some of them but yeah we have that crap

1683.539 --> 1685.96
here too

1688.7 --> 1691.7
foreign

1692.44 --> 1699.14
s hanging around though so

1695.419 --> 1700.94
but I mean like years back over a decade

1699.14 --> 1704.419
back it was

1700.94 --> 1707.24
kind of the rage for a while

1704.419 --> 1709.5200000000002
so I happen to see those hanger lying

1707.24 --> 1711.74
around and in the grass

1709.52 --> 1714.3799999999999
stupid

1711.74 --> 1718.34
garbage throwing away people

1714.38 --> 1720.919
I would see those cans regularly but now

1718.34 --> 1724.48
no not so much I don't see a lot of like

1720.919 --> 1724.48
junk anywhere

1724.76 --> 1728.9
it's all relatively clean

1727.12 --> 1731.36
[Music]

1728.9 --> 1733.94
inner city except for garbage day

1731.36 --> 1736.6399999999999
because then when it's windy yeah [ __ ]

1733.94 --> 1737.96
goes blowing around sometimes but uh

1736.64 --> 1740.539
overall

1737.96 --> 1743.74
it's much cleaner

1740.539 --> 1743.74
than a decade ago

1744.2 --> 1748.76
and even more than two decades ago like

1746.12 --> 1750.02
the 90s things were a little messy in

1748.76 --> 1753.3799999999999
there

1750.02 --> 1755.72
lots of people just left garbage very

1753.38 --> 1757.24
agitating to me

1755.72 --> 1760.98
anyway

1757.24 --> 1760.98
[Music]

1763.6 --> 1768.5
I guess that's my hippie raising

1766.64 --> 1769.76
which is the good part of the hippie

1768.5 --> 1775.24
raising

1769.76 --> 1775.24
like don't leave junk like never

1776.12 --> 1780.799
keep your junk with you until you find a

1778.64 --> 1783.26
trash can

1780.799 --> 1786.86
and sometimes if it's really bad in a

1783.26 --> 1789.679
nice place you go pick up garbage and

1786.86 --> 1792.26
put it in a trash can

1789.679 --> 1797.0800000000002
because when you do that

1792.26 --> 1799.82
that reinforces this the spirit of

1797.08 --> 1801.9189999999999
cleanliness like in that area if you

1799.82 --> 1805.9399999999998
always leave the junk then there will

1801.919 --> 1809.74
always be more junk

1805.94 --> 1809.74
if you clean it up then

1810.14 --> 1817.3400000000001
the barrier for the The Lazy junk

1813.679 --> 1819.2
throwing away people will be higher

1817.34 --> 1821.779
if they already see junk lying around

1819.2 --> 1823.22
then they're more easy to not care and

1821.779 --> 1825.5
do it you see

1823.22 --> 1829.159
yeah

1825.5 --> 1832.1
so cleaning it up also helps

1829.159 --> 1835.3400000000001
junk throwing away idiots

1832.1 --> 1837.98
from doing it less like it helps

1835.34 --> 1839.539
it helps prevent that people often don't

1837.98 --> 1842.059
realize that they're like oh we're gonna

1839.539 --> 1844.1589999999999
start cleaning it's just forever Nobody

1842.059 --> 1846.98
Does it then it's forever when it

1844.159 --> 1849.8600000000001
actually becomes cleaned up then it

1846.98 --> 1851.72
doesn't become as filled with junk as

1849.86 --> 1854.12
quickly because there's now this

1851.72 --> 1857.419
threshold

1854.12 --> 1860.9599999999998
for people because it's clean there's

1857.419 --> 1863.539
not junk lying around anymore so

1860.96 --> 1866.02
now they feel more like polluters when

1863.539 --> 1866.02
they do it

1867.38 --> 1872.779
yeah anyway it's just hippie raising by

1870.86 --> 1875.059
the way it's not like my parents taught

1872.779 --> 1877.1
me this except for the preliminaries now

1875.059 --> 1878.6
it's like oh this is the right thing to

1877.1 --> 1881.12
do this is like something I got taught

1878.6 --> 1885.08
when I was six or seven

1881.12 --> 1887.899
and then completely by myself I I got

1885.08 --> 1890.539
really fanatical with that

1887.899 --> 1894.279
as in this is really important this is

1890.539 --> 1894.279
going to be a part of who I am

1899.24 --> 1904.64
but yeah in my family like throwing junk

1902.12 --> 1907.039
underground was a big No-No and our

1904.64 --> 1909.8200000000002
house was clean there was no junk lying

1907.039 --> 1909.82
around on the floor

1909.86 --> 1913.899
even though I was into Legos

1916.159 --> 1920.96
so yeah sometimes it did happen and then

1918.679 --> 1921.98
my mom would step on a piece of Legos

1920.96 --> 1925.22
and

1921.98 --> 1927.38
and cry out like crazy and then get

1925.22 --> 1929.84
really pissed off that I left around the

1927.38 --> 1930.8600000000001
Legos and then eventually like past my

1929.84 --> 1933.74
seven

1930.86 --> 1936.1999999999998
my age of seven I was like okay I'm not

1933.74 --> 1940.24
gonna leave my Legos around

1936.2 --> 1940.24
I'm just gonna keep it in my room

1943.039 --> 1947.099
anyway

1943.97 --> 1947.099
[Music]

1947.539 --> 1950.96
McDonald's yeah

1952.7 --> 1958.52
it's gross when they do that

1955.22 --> 1961.1000000000001
although a lot of them at least kind of

1958.52 --> 1964.399
like put it in the baggie and turn the

1961.1 --> 1967.4189999999999
baggie into a trash can so it's not just

1964.399 --> 1967.4189999999999
all over the place

1968.0 --> 1972.32
I've seen that it's like okay yeah they

1970.64 --> 1974.659
are throwing it out of the door which is

1972.32 --> 1976.52
[ __ ] up but at least they're just kind

1974.659 --> 1980.419
of leaving it in a baggie

1976.52 --> 1983.12
so that's kind of nice it's weird

1980.419 --> 1985.5800000000002
but I mean it's a neat trick

1983.12 --> 1987.799
I wish they'd just like just kept it

1985.58 --> 1990.9189999999999
around until they found a trash can then

1987.799 --> 1993.279
and then throw it out but I mean yeah

1990.919 --> 1993.279
whatever

1995.419 --> 2001.24
nip bottles I don't know what a knit

1998.059 --> 2005.2
bottle is but I hate people that

2001.24 --> 2008.58
bottle drinks and then throw it out

2005.2 --> 2008.5800000000002
that's [ __ ] annoying

2012.82 --> 2018.34
people drinking from plastic bottles

2015.34 --> 2019.4189999999999
overall annoy the [ __ ] out of me

2018.34 --> 2023.019
yeah

2019.419 --> 2027.24
I don't drink from I haven't drunk

2023.019 --> 2027.24
from any form of plastic bottle

2029.039 --> 2035.86
since 2000

2031.82 --> 2038.98
[Music]

2035.86 --> 2038.9799999999998
in 2009

2039.539 --> 2046.2
I mean the organic stores they don't

2042.399 --> 2046.1999999999998
even have plastic bottles

2050.8 --> 2057.82
and like yeah so I just take glass

2053.98 --> 2061.919
bottles I wanna drink stuff I'll take a

2057.82 --> 2061.9190000000003
glass bottle with it just fine

2065.139 --> 2071.3990000000003
right and you can always use it as a as

2068.139 --> 2071.3990000000003
a weapon of self-defense

2072.22 --> 2076.06
can't really do that with plastic

2073.96 --> 2078.599
bottles now can you

2076.06 --> 2078.599
anyway

2084.46 --> 2090.94
oh that [ __ ] Mark yeah but

2088.419 --> 2092.98
yeah that crap those little [ __ ]

2090.94 --> 2095.56
models

2092.98 --> 2097.96
well you can have one comfort for that

2095.56 --> 2100.74
more color and that is people that are

2097.96 --> 2104.619
on those things

2100.74 --> 2107.2599999999998
they die a terrible death

2104.619 --> 2111.28
because the drinks that are in that type

2107.26 --> 2114.94
of bottle are like hyper toxic

2111.28 --> 2117.76
that's not just like small little

2114.94 --> 2120.28
quality that's garbage that that's like

2117.76 --> 2125.1600000000003
the worst processed sugar with coloring

2120.28 --> 2125.1600000000003
age like that stuff is pure poison

2125.8 --> 2131.44
if I drink that bottle stuff the little

2128.859 --> 2133.359
bottle I'd probably hallucinate from all

2131.44 --> 2136.619
the toxins that are in it

2133.359 --> 2136.619
don't recommend it

2138.04 --> 2144.04
but yeah

2139.54 --> 2146.38
those that stuff is bad really bad

2144.04 --> 2148.72
and when you see that lying around that

2146.38 --> 2150.46
means there's somebody that's in trouble

2148.72 --> 2153.04
with their life

2150.46 --> 2156.82
always I've never met anybody that

2153.04 --> 2159.16
drinks that stuff that isn't in trouble

2156.82 --> 2162.6400000000003
with their life

2159.16 --> 2167.52
either in the form of alcoholism or just

2162.64 --> 2167.52
not having control over their impulses

2167.92 --> 2175.9
every single time I've never met one

2171.76 --> 2179.8590000000004
person ever under any circumstances that

2175.9 --> 2184.44
had that type of mini bottle drinks

2179.859 --> 2186.16
that wasn't like borderline criminal or

2184.44 --> 2190.119
traumatized

2186.16 --> 2193.0
crazy drunk person or something so

2190.119 --> 2195.54
that's a good sign to know to know that

2193.0 --> 2195.54
about it

2198.76 --> 2202.8590000000004
mostly it's it's like

2203.32 --> 2211.079
borderline alcoholic guys or girls like

2208.119 --> 2211.079
in their 20s

2213.76 --> 2219.0400000000004
but those people don't end up well if

2216.94 --> 2220.66
you have make a habit of debting that

2219.04 --> 2222.88
yeah at first it's like oh that's kind

2220.66 --> 2225.52
of cool and you're still like young and

2222.88 --> 2228.28
lean and all that you keep drinking that

2225.52 --> 2230.56
stuff and by the time you're 30 if

2228.28 --> 2232.78
you're not literally dead

2230.56 --> 2235.42
or in a hospital waiting for like a

2232.78 --> 2236.619
liver replacement or something you're

2235.42 --> 2238.7200000000003
gonna be

2236.619 --> 2242.26
a blob

2238.72 --> 2246.7799999999997
that stuff will [ __ ] you up

2242.26 --> 2246.78
and I mean [ __ ] you up dude

2248.079 --> 2252.52
I mean straight out alcoholics that that

2250.599 --> 2255.6400000000003
have a bottle of whiskey around at all

2252.52 --> 2258.82
time will not get as [ __ ] up by that

2255.64 --> 2261.64
as you drinking those stupid little mini

2258.82 --> 2264.3
bottles of flugel and all that other

2261.64 --> 2264.2999999999997
garbage

2266.14 --> 2270.06
because that stuff is super toxic

2271.119 --> 2273.599
anyway

2276.02 --> 2279.7
[Music]

2278.02 --> 2282.78
I don't know what that is but that

2279.7 --> 2282.7799999999997
sounds very toxic

2294.28 --> 2296.7000000000003
okay

2296.76 --> 2299.9590000000003
[Music]

2311.98 --> 2316.38
that sounds very creepy Marco

2323.859 --> 2327.24
where is that

2329.74 --> 2335.56
you're not saying they put that in the

2331.78 --> 2339.2400000000002
drinks right I mean that's just

2335.56 --> 2339.24
like why did you bring that up

2344.92 --> 2350.56
crack pipes Jesus but that's really

2348.339 --> 2352.54
[ __ ] up yeah we don't see that around

2350.56 --> 2355.24
here

2352.54 --> 2357.2799999999997
I mean yeah there's plenty of

2355.24 --> 2359.4399999999996
dope heads

2357.28 --> 2360.6400000000003
but I mean yeah fair enough I'm kind of

2359.44 --> 2364.7400000000002
like that

2360.64 --> 2367.18
I smoke every day I smoke weed everyday

2364.74 --> 2368.9199999999996
yeah but not the American [ __ ] up

2367.18 --> 2370.839
stuff that'll turn you into a zombie

2368.92 --> 2374.14
though

2370.839 --> 2377.02
but uh there's plenty of that

2374.14 --> 2380.3199999999997
but there's no you don't like stroll

2377.02 --> 2383.5
around and just see like some crack pipe

2380.32 --> 2386.46
and the side of the road here thank God

2383.5 --> 2389.14
that that's not around here

2386.46 --> 2391.8
I think that's really like a California

2389.14 --> 2391.7999999999997
thing

2397.72 --> 2400.859
thanks Biden

2412.119 --> 2417.78
weight loss drug

2415.42 --> 2422.26
what

2417.78 --> 2425.3390000000004
Jesus so it's a nutrient blocker

2422.26 --> 2425.3390000000004
what the [ __ ]

2425.92 --> 2431.619
that sounds like

2427.599 --> 2434.1600000000003
a poison I would feed Vermin to kill

2431.619 --> 2434.1600000000003
them off

2435.82 --> 2438.9
what the [ __ ]

2439.06 --> 2443.7599999999998
they're using that as a weight loss drug

2441.16 --> 2443.7599999999998
that is

2444.82 --> 2449.88
that is almost like fentanyl level

2447.22 --> 2449.8799999999997
creepy

2451.119 --> 2456.339
Jesus

2453.48 --> 2459.64
why would you do that why would you

2456.339 --> 2462.04
that's just [ __ ] dangerous

2459.64 --> 2465.2799999999997
I mean there's better ways to lose

2462.04 --> 2467.859
weight than to prevent yourselves from

2465.28 --> 2469.38
being capable of absorbing nutrients

2467.859 --> 2472.5989999999997
well which will

2469.38 --> 2475.0
inevitably cause their death

2472.599 --> 2477.88
if you overdo it I mean

2475.0 --> 2480.7
it's like yeah keeping yourself on a

2477.88 --> 2482.92
cellular level on the edge of death

2480.7 --> 2484.839
and yeah if I do it too much then you

2482.92 --> 2488.38
die it's like oh that seems like a

2484.839 --> 2491.16
worthwhile exploit to lose weight

2488.38 --> 2491.1600000000003
ah

2491.44 --> 2494.7000000000003
what the [ __ ]

2506.079 --> 2513.1600000000003
I mean what if you just followed like

2510.28 --> 2516.119
any basic holistic

2513.16 --> 2516.1189999999997
food doctor

2516.22 --> 2521.6189999999997
like Dr stanback right very bad it's all

2520.06 --> 2523.18
over the place man

2521.619 --> 2525.2200000000003
holistic

2523.18 --> 2526.839
nutritionist

2525.22 --> 2529.72
doctor

2526.839 --> 2532.96
they will help you with so many tips on

2529.72 --> 2535.359
how to lose weight like it's just right

2532.96 --> 2537.579
there like a a nice family ready to

2535.359 --> 2540.16
welcome you in and it's all good it's

2537.579 --> 2544.0
only good it's never like oh there's

2540.16 --> 2545.3799999999997
this risk no it's always good like why

2544.0 --> 2547.72
the [ __ ] would you

2545.38 --> 2551.6800000000003
would you use like a

2547.72 --> 2554.4399999999996
a heavy weird toxin that would block

2551.68 --> 2556.859
your cells from absorbing nutrients in

2554.44 --> 2556.859
Jesus

2557.32 --> 2563.02
it's like yeah doctor I need to lose

2560.2 --> 2566.9399999999996
some weight do you know what to help yes

2563.02 --> 2566.94
try Russian Roulette

2567.76 --> 2575.1400000000003
you could seriously lose weight

2572.14 --> 2578.68
from the from the thrill and the kick of

2575.14 --> 2581.2599999999998
it right and hey if you die then you

2578.68 --> 2584.44
lose all your weight

2581.26 --> 2588.1800000000003
well doctor that sounds like a

2584.44 --> 2588.18
worthwhile exploit

2588.78 --> 2594.46
I'm sorry that's just insane I mean

2592.0 --> 2597.119
maybe it's not that risky but

2594.46 --> 2597.119
God

2598.18 --> 2603.46
it certainly sounds it

2601.359 --> 2606.839
uh

2603.46 --> 2606.839
yeah God don't go there

2609.0 --> 2614.92
amputate [ __ ] off Martin okay I was

2612.7 --> 2617.68
jokingly taking it too far you don't

2614.92 --> 2619.78
have to literally now start scatter

2617.68 --> 2621.0989999999997
gunning that level that that's just

2619.78 --> 2623.5
[ __ ] up

2621.099 --> 2626.38
ah

2623.5 --> 2629.68
yeah we know what they want they want to

2626.38 --> 2631.6600000000003
give us the three food groups

2629.68 --> 2634.48
yeah

2631.66 --> 2638.2
the bugs

2634.48 --> 2641.5
the fake cancer meat and the Soylent

2638.2 --> 2643.48
Green that's what they want yes it's all

2641.5 --> 2647.88
really nice

2643.48 --> 2647.88
but I'm just gonna say no

2650.32 --> 2653.55
[Music]

2655.06 --> 2659.5
I mean seriously like why the [ __ ] would

2657.339 --> 2661.7799999999997
you even eat fake cancer meat just think

2659.5 --> 2663.52
think about it don't think about it too

2661.78 --> 2664.78
much or you'll throw up

2663.52 --> 2670.119
but

2664.78 --> 2674.099
that stuff is is a growing blob

2670.119 --> 2678.339
that well it's not just growing on air

2674.099 --> 2681.2200000000003
right it's not just just breathing on

2678.339 --> 2683.56
the skin and just I'm just converting

2681.22 --> 2686.9199999999996
that air into that thing no no that's

2683.56 --> 2689.52
not happening they're feeding it stuff

2686.92 --> 2689.52
so

2691.9 --> 2697.619
right they're feeding it probably

2694.42 --> 2700.119
minerals and water and oils or something

2697.619 --> 2703.3
to make it grow

2700.119 --> 2705.46
well I'd rather than just get the raw

2703.3 --> 2709.1800000000003
stuff that they feed the fake meat

2705.46 --> 2713.56
instead of the fake meat

2709.18 --> 2716.98
like I'd rather like eat dirt

2713.56 --> 2719.5
from the ground then eat fake meat and I

2716.98 --> 2721.48
think I'd actually be healthier for it

2719.5 --> 2724.859
too

2721.48 --> 2724.859
is veganism gay

2726.04 --> 2730.8
or yeah

2727.9 --> 2730.8
arguably

2732.52 --> 2736.079
although not all of it

2738.52 --> 2743.859
I mean if it's like cultural veganism

2741.22 --> 2746.9199999999996
like for example in India although

2743.859 --> 2748.96
there's also vegetarianism there

2746.92 --> 2751.9
that's very different because it's very

2748.96 --> 2754.9
carefully worked out and like people

2751.9 --> 2758.8
have the body for it and all that

2754.9 --> 2760.96
but if you're like oh no I oh the poor

2758.8 --> 2763.119
little animals

2760.96 --> 2765.46
if you're gonna be vegan because of

2763.119 --> 2768.76
emotional Regan reasons

2765.46 --> 2771.88
I'm sorry I I do sympathize with you but

2768.76 --> 2773.8590000000004
you are gay

2771.88 --> 2777.339
and if you're a woman

2773.859 --> 2780.22
I think you're like a little bit more

2777.339 --> 2781.359
excused for being gay like that than a

2780.22 --> 2785.7599999999998
man

2781.359 --> 2785.7599999999998
but I mean it is gay yes

2786.119 --> 2792.6400000000003
and most people don't even do it well

2790.9 --> 2795.64
they don't understand the full

2792.64 --> 2797.819
implications of of having a diet like

2795.64 --> 2797.819
that

2799.3 --> 2804.579
it is a struggle to really be vegan and

2802.42 --> 2807.9
it is kind of expensive

2804.579 --> 2807.9
if you want to do it right

2809.5 --> 2814.72
humans aren't herbivore that's right

2811.42 --> 2815.92
there's the same substances same

2814.72 --> 2818.2599999999998
proteins

2815.92 --> 2820.599
that we get from meat very quickly and

2818.26 --> 2823.48
assimilate very quickly

2820.599 --> 2825.52
that we could get from knots and all

2823.48 --> 2828.119
these certain types of vegetables well

2825.52 --> 2828.119
guess what

2828.16 --> 2832.839
the the meat

2829.9 --> 2836.2000000000003
assimilation of those proteins is like a

2832.839 --> 2840.7599999999998
one or two step metabolic process while

2836.2 --> 2844.66
the nuts is like a 10 step Cycle takes

2840.76 --> 2847.2400000000002
very long and it actually rubs your body

2844.66 --> 2850.54
of stuff

2847.24 --> 2853.7799999999997
that it needs to make it into that so

2850.54 --> 2856.48
it's a slow grinding process

2853.78 --> 2859.599
to get those protein from the nuts it

2856.48 --> 2860.94
will work but it'll is a very gross it's

2859.599 --> 2864.7000000000003
like a very

2860.94 --> 2867.94
dirty project for the body

2864.7 --> 2870.0989999999997
it does create extra waste it's not

2867.94 --> 2872.44
healthy for you really if that is the

2870.099 --> 2873.579
only way you can get those proteins you

2872.44 --> 2875.68
see

2873.579 --> 2876.88
and something that vegans don't often

2875.68 --> 2880.8999999999996
mention

2876.88 --> 2884.2000000000003
and you always will end up

2880.9 --> 2887.6800000000003
if you want to be fit as a vegan you eat

2884.2 --> 2891.46
you need to eat a lot more than if you

2887.68 --> 2895.06
want to be fit as a non-vegan

2891.46 --> 2897.76
just look at how much vegans eat

2895.06 --> 2901.48
and if they don't eat that much while

2897.76 --> 2903.5200000000004
vegan then they become really Slim

2901.48 --> 2906.4
and that'll still look kind of good like

2903.52 --> 2908.44
Eric Dubai But Eric debate like just

2906.4 --> 2911.5
look they had like this

2908.44 --> 2914.619
slideshow of typical meals that he eats

2911.5 --> 2918.099
you know that's huge guys those plates

2914.619 --> 2920.319
of that's [ __ ] huge

2918.099 --> 2921.88
like quantity wise when I look at that

2920.319 --> 2925.9
that's like

2921.88 --> 2928.78
that's not one day's meal for me that's

2925.9 --> 2932.2000000000003
like two or three days worth of food

2928.78 --> 2934.6800000000003
quantity wise but that's because I eat

2932.2 --> 2934.68
meat

2935.8 --> 2942.2200000000003
I and I wouldn't even be oh oh meat no

2938.38 --> 2944.7400000000002
no just like a quarter a fifth of that

2942.22 --> 2947.98
quantity would be meat and then I could

2944.74 --> 2950.9199999999996
eat three days of that yeah it's because

2947.98 --> 2954.94
vegans effectively need to eat more if

2950.92 --> 2958.2400000000002
they wish to stay fit and that's a fact

2954.94 --> 2959.44
now if you're like almost a farmer you

2958.24 --> 2961.72
like

2959.44 --> 2964.06
have a huge Garden you're really good

2961.72 --> 2965.5
with it and you get all those vegetables

2964.06 --> 2968.0789999999997
yourself right

2965.5 --> 2969.64
well then you have a surplus you have a

2968.079 --> 2973.0600000000004
lot of vegetables and you can definitely

2969.64 --> 2975.04
do that and then be very fit and like

2973.06 --> 2977.98
you probably have like this golden shine

2975.04 --> 2981.06
come off you but it's not like easy to

2977.98 --> 2981.06
get to that point man

2984.28 --> 2989.7400000000002
right but one thing that that will

2987.22 --> 2993.22
happen when you start eating vegan and

2989.74 --> 2995.5
you avoid fake meat and like soy and all

2993.22 --> 2999.0989999999997
that [ __ ]

2995.5 --> 3001.5
if you do that you're right what the

2999.099 --> 3005.339
[ __ ] are you talking about Larry he's

3001.5 --> 3007.2
just a vegan he really lives that

3005.339 --> 3010.64
he's not a shill

3007.2 --> 3010.64
just because he's vegan

3014.22 --> 3019.859
and he unders he's wise with it

3017.28 --> 3022.5
he's not Savannah about it to others

3019.859 --> 3024.96
like he used to be

3022.5 --> 3026.46
right but uh

3024.96 --> 3028.03
I wasn't talking about freaking

3026.46 --> 3031.079
distractions

3028.03 --> 3031.079
[Music]

3033.0 --> 3040.819
conscious eating plants yeah

3036.26 --> 3040.8190000000004
Jamie's seal sea level

3041.64 --> 3046.14
but I mean I'm not just only gonna eat

3044.099 --> 3049.559
meat because

3046.14 --> 3052.3799999999997
I mean the ldwf they're not so much

3049.559 --> 3055.079
concerned about us eating plants I think

3052.38 --> 3058.44
that the whole vegetarian veganism is

3055.079 --> 3060.98
rather a transitional plan for them

3058.44 --> 3064.44
because they don't really give a [ __ ]

3060.98 --> 3067.04
they just want us to slowly maneuver

3064.44 --> 3073.5
away from eating meat and then they'll

3067.04 --> 3073.5
slowly maneuver us way from vegetables

3073.859 --> 3081.18
into bugs fake meat and soil and green

3078.78 --> 3084.3
so

3081.18 --> 3087.0
it was it was just like mostly just

3084.3 --> 3089.88
sympathy harping

3087.0 --> 3091.079
and like this ridiculous hippie hippy

3089.88 --> 3092.94
topia

3091.079 --> 3096.1800000000003
where all the animals are just our

3092.94 --> 3098.94
friends and oh it plants together like

3096.18 --> 3102.72
that was all an illusion just for the

3098.94 --> 3105.559
transition into the 1984 slave system

3102.72 --> 3110.54
where we get to eat

3105.559 --> 3110.5400000000004
the fake meat and the Soylent Green

3112.38 --> 3117.6800000000003
which is really mean spirited to that to

3115.02 --> 3117.68
those hippies

3117.839 --> 3121.5789999999997
I feel personally hurt by that

3123.24 --> 3130.4399999999996
I mean I'd be a vegan

3126.359 --> 3133.2799999999997
if I didn't realize that I really need

3130.44 --> 3133.28
that meat

3134.099 --> 3139.38
but that doesn't mean like oh God

3137.0 --> 3141.72
I'm not like that I

3139.38 --> 3145.1400000000003
eat my meat very carefully and I don't

3141.72 --> 3148.8799999999997
eat meat every day like the worst I do

3145.14 --> 3148.8799999999997
is like eat salami on my pizza

3152.0 --> 3156.42
because like when do I even eat meat

3154.98 --> 3160.339
it's

3156.42 --> 3160.339
one once a week

3160.8 --> 3169.319
pretty much oh oh my God so much no I

3166.02 --> 3172.2599999999998
eat very little meat but I when I do I

3169.319 --> 3175.7599999999998
really assimilate it

3172.26 --> 3175.76
chicken broth yes awesome

3176.339 --> 3180.92
it's gross but it's really healthy

3181.079 --> 3186.02
if it's good wild ranged chickens that

3183.839 --> 3186.02
is

3192.48 --> 3198.0
this is a poop okay Mark colored well I

3196.02 --> 3200.819
don't that no not really

3198.0 --> 3203.099
but I mean

3200.819 --> 3206.3
you're gonna get plenty of the poop when

3203.099 --> 3206.3
you're gonna eat the bugs

3206.46 --> 3210.079
because that's all throughout it

3210.18 --> 3217.2799999999997
I mean bugs

3212.579 --> 3217.28
In Pockets [ __ ] over each other

3221.339 --> 3225.72
it's not like they're all gonna be

3222.839 --> 3227.94
carefully washed

3225.72 --> 3229.6189999999997
like that I don't think so I don't wanna

3227.94 --> 3231.9
I don't even want to know how they

3229.619 --> 3234.359
freaking process it I just

3231.9 --> 3238.38
I'm not gonna eat some bugs

3234.359 --> 3240.7799999999997
and I'm not gonna eat poop

3238.38 --> 3244.2200000000003
and I'm not gonna eat fake meat and I'm

3240.78 --> 3244.2200000000003
not gonna eat Soylent Green

3246.24 --> 3254.359
I eat chicken I eat cow

3250.559 --> 3254.3590000000004
and really that's pretty much it

3256.26 --> 3261.98
I haven't ate pork

3258.54 --> 3265.619
in over 20 years

3261.98 --> 3269.04
entirely not even like a secret snack on

3265.619 --> 3270.54
the outside no just never

3269.04 --> 3273.18
[Music]

3270.54 --> 3275.94
and I'll yeah well it might have eaten

3273.18 --> 3278.7
dare like at Christmas

3275.94 --> 3281.2200000000003
a few years ago like I'll eat Wilds

3278.7 --> 3282.66
right I'll eat wild dare or wild boar or

3281.22 --> 3286.2
something maybe

3282.66 --> 3288.2999999999997
I'd go for a wild boar perhaps

3286.2 --> 3292.04
I don't really see that as Pig although

3288.3 --> 3292.04
it is well kind of the same family

3294.119 --> 3300.7200000000003
free range so yeah beef salami

3297.2 --> 3303.72
organic beef salami

3300.72 --> 3306.14
it's expensive but it's [ __ ]

3303.72 --> 3306.14
brilliant

3308.46 --> 3314.579
I'm so glad that there is just beef

3310.859 --> 3317.839
salami and not only pork based salami

3314.579 --> 3317.8390000000004
which is what it used to be

3318.24 --> 3324.3799999999997
beef slime is really development that

3320.28 --> 3324.38
started to happen in the 90s more

3327.0 --> 3331.8
they used to like combine it it's like

3329.22 --> 3334.68
beef and pork

3331.8 --> 3337.26
that that used to be very typical

3334.68 --> 3339.68
I'm glad there's just beef only salami

3337.26 --> 3339.6800000000003
now anyway

3346.5 --> 3352.4
you can't live without bacon oh poor

3349.98 --> 3352.4
Piggy

3354.3 --> 3359.3390000000004
every time I hear somebody say I can't

3356.579 --> 3360.8390000000004
live without bacon I imagine them being

3359.339 --> 3362.46
a pig

3360.839 --> 3365.96
saying that

3362.46 --> 3365.96
oh I just can't stop

3367.98 --> 3372.859
yeah piggy I know you can't stop eating

3370.5 --> 3372.859
bacon

3384.3 --> 3390.119
let's just say

3386.819 --> 3392.64
bacon grow yes

3390.119 --> 3395.339
I don't eat it anymore and now even the

3392.64 --> 3399.0
smell of bacon is very gross to me

3395.339 --> 3401.339
but I do understand like the flavor drug

3399.0 --> 3403.38
of it there is like it is very special

3401.339 --> 3405.96
flavorous drug

3403.38 --> 3408.54
to bacon

3405.96 --> 3411.8
that is just very very appealing

3408.54 --> 3411.8
especially when you're young

3416.339 --> 3422.7
shredded to the gills okay

3420.48 --> 3426.3
yeah

3422.7 --> 3429.0
too bad it's not really all up there you

3426.3 --> 3430.6800000000003
know I mean your body's sure gonna be

3429.0 --> 3432.72
lean

3430.68 --> 3434.2799999999997
but I mean that Fat's gonna influence

3432.72 --> 3437.18
the brain too

3434.28 --> 3437.1800000000003
moxie

3438.3 --> 3444.619
I would have picked better protein

3441.48 --> 3444.619
and fats

3445.8 --> 3452.76
yeah and besides I I don't I I don't eat

3449.819 --> 3456.48
pig I think that I don't have any direct

3452.76 --> 3459.42
proof or anything but got this very very

3456.48 --> 3462.059
strong suspicion that

3459.42 --> 3465.48
pigs aren't

3462.059 --> 3469.6400000000003
really that far away from having been

3465.48 --> 3469.64
human related in the past

3471.839 --> 3476.04
I think that pigs might have originally

3473.94 --> 3478.68
been

3476.04 --> 3480.42
human hybrids

3478.68 --> 3482.22
so

3480.42 --> 3485.599
and I think they might have even been

3482.22 --> 3489.2999999999997
originally like redesigned as

3485.599 --> 3491.579
bio incubation vessels

3489.3 --> 3495.2000000000003
because they have this insane the

3491.579 --> 3495.2000000000003
impractically large gut

3501.78 --> 3509.3390000000004
so I really think that pix used to be

3505.46 --> 3512.54
human hybrids that were used for

3509.339 --> 3514.5589999999997
for example organ transplant and hey

3512.54 --> 3516.599
they do that

3514.559 --> 3518.6400000000003
you have pig heart

3516.599 --> 3521.2200000000003
[ __ ] I mean I wouldn't do it but I mean

3518.64 --> 3523.5589999999997
I think that that's what picks before

3521.22 --> 3526.319
they were used as farming animals for

3523.559 --> 3528.7200000000003
food I think they were originally in the

3526.319 --> 3531.24
earlier ages

3528.72 --> 3534.0589999999997
the high peaking civilization when there

3531.24 --> 3539.04
was like a hybridizing animals and all

3534.059 --> 3541.559
that I think that they were used as

3539.04 --> 3544.319
as Medical

3541.559 --> 3546.1800000000003
creatures

3544.319 --> 3548.66
I think they're the result of medical

3546.18 --> 3550.98
experiment basically and very early

3548.66 --> 3552.8999999999996
bioengineering industry I think that

3550.98 --> 3555.119
they are the result of that

3552.9 --> 3557.579
really

3555.119 --> 3562.88
I'm not joking

3557.579 --> 3562.88
also they are extraordinarily smart

3563.46 --> 3568.079
like they have pigs have actual

3566.22 --> 3571.6189999999997
intellectual thought

3568.079 --> 3573.54
complex thoughts even complex social

3571.619 --> 3578.28
thoughts

3573.54 --> 3582.2599999999998
pigs can size up the intelligence

3578.28 --> 3582.26
of other animals and humans

3582.599 --> 3586.319
unless they're really traumatized

3584.339 --> 3590.54
because yeah pigs can get traumatized

3586.319 --> 3590.54
and then they get broken like humans

3592.14 --> 3597.96
that happens too

3594.299 --> 3598.799
the pig is left like really to be like a

3597.96 --> 3601.799
pet

3598.799 --> 3604.16
they can turn out to be extraordinarily

3601.799 --> 3604.16
smart

3604.98 --> 3609.059
but they're really modest about it you

3606.78 --> 3611.6400000000003
see like pigs are not arrogant about

3609.059 --> 3614.1600000000003
their intelligence at all most other

3611.64 --> 3615.9
animals that are kind of smart they're

3614.16 --> 3617.7599999999998
arrogant about it

3615.9 --> 3620.46
pigs are not

3617.76 --> 3622.76
they're very lovable social animals

3620.46 --> 3622.76
really

3625.2 --> 3628.7599999999998
unless they get territorial

3628.92 --> 3632.78
then they can be real bastards

3634.319 --> 3639.54
so you got to be careful with the males

3637.44 --> 3641.64
and females when they're pregnant I

3639.54 --> 3645.119
think too I'm not sure

3641.64 --> 3646.5589999999997
Maybe not maybe that's just dogs

3645.119 --> 3649.92
anyway

3646.559 --> 3653.42
so I don't like to eat pig I I like I

3649.92 --> 3653.42
think they're really cute as animals

3654.839 --> 3660.619
and like I respect people that would

3657.0 --> 3660.619
have pigs as a as a pet

3661.14 --> 3664.52
if they train him well

3671.819 --> 3676.68
I mean there's very little very few

3674.88 --> 3677.94
things you're going to see that are less

3676.68 --> 3680.819
cute

3677.94 --> 3684.7200000000003
that are more cute than like

3680.819 --> 3687.14
a piglet playing with a cat and a dog

3684.72 --> 3687.14
together

3693.119 --> 3698.299
seriously that's like incredibly cute

3698.46 --> 3700.94
anyway

3702.72 --> 3708.18
they'll literally eat all of you yeah I

3705.54 --> 3710.42
know Jamie sea level but the same goes

3708.18 --> 3713.22
for cats you leave a cat in a house

3710.42 --> 3716.579
locked up with it with somebody that

3713.22 --> 3719.0699999999997
died and they'll eat their face yeah

3716.579 --> 3722.119
a point

3719.07 --> 3722.119
[Music]

3723.799 --> 3729.72
you can turn any animal or a person into

3727.5 --> 3731.579
a monster if you have the right

3729.72 --> 3733.7599999999998
condition so what's the [ __ ] is the

3731.579 --> 3733.76
point

3734.4 --> 3737.1800000000003
foreign

3751.68 --> 3756.1189999999997
no I mean

3754.079 --> 3758.3390000000004
if yeah if you have but if you have a

3756.119 --> 3760.5
pig yard which like a pig strike a whole

3758.339 --> 3764.22
bunch of pigs together in a small space

3760.5 --> 3766.68
well that's not really natural for them

3764.22 --> 3768.9599999999996
if you go lay down in that they will

3766.68 --> 3770.64
probably start biting you

3768.96 --> 3772.799
that's right

3770.64 --> 3775.2
but I mean

3772.799 --> 3777.599
you basically got them in a prison I

3775.2 --> 3780.359
mean if you had pigs that had like a

3777.599 --> 3782.4
field to walk into and you're gonna lie

3780.359 --> 3785.339
down there they're not gonna come over

3782.4 --> 3787.5
and start taking a bite out here

3785.339 --> 3790.46
they would just walk around and

3787.5 --> 3790.46
maybe say hello

3794.339 --> 3798.0789999999997
why am I talking about pigs

3799.14 --> 3803.0989999999997
this is weird

3801.72 --> 3805.98
like

3803.099 --> 3808.7000000000003
where this show goes is sometimes really

3805.98 --> 3808.7
unpredictable

3818.28 --> 3822.42
I'm gonna take a bite out of my

3820.319 --> 3824.4
Illuminati costume before it gets cold

3822.42 --> 3828.5
not that it's gonna really get cold with

3824.4 --> 3828.5
this weather but anyway here we go

3858.42 --> 3860.839
okay

3868.079 --> 3875.52
that's not entirely true flatter Sage

3871.619 --> 3875.52
it's not impossible

3877.619 --> 3884.1600000000003
I mean it's not impossible to chart the

3880.92 --> 3886.44
land masses it's just that

3884.16 --> 3889.14
the tools and the standards we've been

3886.44 --> 3892.4
given to measure it all up

3889.14 --> 3892.4
has been warped

3897.72 --> 3902.2799999999997
but you can technically just like

3899.88 --> 3905.7000000000003
unleash scanners

3902.28 --> 3908.579
including at the ocean bottom

3905.7 --> 3910.5589999999997
and just put all the euclidean measured

3908.579 --> 3913.619
data together

3910.559 --> 3918.3190000000004
it's just that the end result will

3913.619 --> 3918.319
probably just Boggle the mind

3922.44 --> 3927.26
what the [ __ ] why do you think I would

3924.42 --> 3927.26
have any tips

3927.299 --> 3931.859
that's like I'm the last freaking person

3929.76 --> 3934.559
in the world you you want to ask tips

3931.859 --> 3938.299
about that because I am the worst I

3934.559 --> 3938.299
don't know how to chat up women at all

3949.26 --> 3954.9
like my only tip is for but that is only

3951.78 --> 3955.92
because it's me it's like don't overdo

3954.9 --> 3959.94
it

3955.92 --> 3962.2200000000003
like try not to care

3959.94 --> 3964.92
you're gonna end up carrying any weight

3962.22 --> 3966.839
but if you show it too much

3964.92 --> 3968.7000000000003
it'll just put them off that that's

3966.839 --> 3971.04
pretty much it

3968.7 --> 3975.2599999999998
try to be as casual as you can and just

3971.04 --> 3975.2599999999998
seem like you can live without her

3978.48 --> 3983.28
and that will help perhaps I don't know

3980.7 --> 3985.5789999999997
did I just give a tip this could work I

3983.28 --> 3985.579
don't know

3989.28 --> 3996.26
but I mean chatting up women is like to

3992.46 --> 3998.18
me it's been really one of the hardest

3996.26 --> 4001.88
Endeavors

3998.18 --> 4004.819
throughout my life so

4001.88 --> 4007.1600000000003
the only times it really work is when I

4004.819 --> 4009.02
decided I didn't care whether I was

4007.16 --> 4011.24
going to fail or not

4009.02 --> 4014.0
that's literally the times I succeeded

4011.24 --> 4016.5789999999997
like with my ex it's like well she's

4014.0 --> 4018.98
super hot but I don't care if it's not

4016.579 --> 4021.619
gonna work out and guess what it worked

4018.98 --> 4024.14
out sort of

4021.619 --> 4026.859
and then it completely [ __ ] me up

4024.14 --> 4026.859

4041.059 --> 4047.2000000000003

the dental floss opener what the [ __ ]

4057.38 --> 4062.6600000000003
well I guess a question like that could

4059.9 --> 4066.579
work with my ex and she is a dentist and

4062.66 --> 4066.5789999999997
she'd know the answer to that probably

4079.16 --> 4083.3799999999997
you're a [ __ ] up creep Jamie

4110.12 --> 4116.299
okay is this it

that's a really really tiny little

4116.299 --> 4118.9

4119.179 --> 4124.0
that's quite ridiculous how small that

cute

4132.08 --> 4134.859

uh DJ one deck welcome back

4239.239 --> 4243.159
turned out it was really him after all

4244.34 --> 4249.28
a new account

4260.26 --> 4268.42
thanks for the poem that's hilarious

4265.82 --> 4268.42
hmm

4275.239 --> 4277.659
okay

4314.96 --> 4319.659
it just happens

4317.12 --> 4319.659
right

4327.199 --> 4333.699
yeah I did no I know it's a thumbnail

4330.02 --> 4333.6990000000005
and I did zoom in okay

4339.08 --> 4344.199
but I mean it's not much of a map that

4341.06 --> 4344.1990000000005

man I went to bed way too late yesterday

4399.26 --> 4402.46
kept up by stuff

4408.32 --> 4411.92
that's also the reason why it's a bit

4410.0 --> 4414.94
late

4411.92 --> 4414.9400000000005
just a little bit

4414.98 --> 4417.159
foreign

4417.34 --> 4422.42
I do that

4419.9 --> 4424.46
I don't have a lot of like very focused

4422.42 --> 4426.62
things to roll out I really need to get

4424.46 --> 4429.46
to bed earlier to have that kind of show

4426.62 --> 4429.46
happen like yesterday

4429.95 --> 4432.159
[Music]

4430.159 --> 4432.159
um

4440.12 --> 4444.159
so they're mapping up the ocean bottom

4441.92 --> 4444.159
yeah

4448.06 --> 4454.2390000000005
[Music]

4449.48 --> 4454.239
right now the interesting thing is that

4454.46 --> 4461.06
the sonar mapping yeah at what point

4458.06 --> 4462.679
will they be able to like have the when

4461.06 --> 4465.14
are the puzzle pieces gonna start

4462.679 --> 4467.3
overlapping with the scan right they

4465.14 --> 4469.84
find like oh we're literally finding the

4467.3 --> 4469.84
other part

4470.48 --> 4474.678999999999
and this is apparently connected and I

4473.48 --> 4477.5
think that what they're going to end

4474.679 --> 4480.26
result with is just like the scans are

4477.5 --> 4483.76
just gonna like interconnect in a way

4480.26 --> 4483.76
that they can't make sense of

4484.94 --> 4490.4
and why

4486.8 --> 4492.4400000000005
because the realm is looping

4490.4 --> 4494.96
it would be like it's stuck in a

4492.44 --> 4497.839999999999
wormhole so there's like this Contour of

4494.96 --> 4501.679
interconnection and they just

4497.84 --> 4504.8
won't be able to make sense of it

4501.679 --> 4507.76
it's like yeah it's connected but I mean

4504.8 --> 4507.76
it shouldn't

4511.1 --> 4514.9400000000005
like

4513.02 --> 4517.34
in accordance with our logical

4514.94 --> 4518.299999999999
physicality assumption based mind it

4517.34 --> 4520.28
shouldn't

4518.3 --> 4522.4400000000005
but there it is it's connecting right

4520.28 --> 4524.54
there we got the scan and like how we

4522.44 --> 4526.639999999999
make sense of this

4524.54 --> 4529.46
so every time they're gonna like take

4526.64 --> 4532.76
the map scans and try to put it into

4529.46 --> 4535.52
some like euclidean unified model

4532.76 --> 4537.14
and so we finally know where the edge is

4535.52 --> 4540.02
or something right and then they're

4537.14 --> 4542.360000000001
gonna be like yeah but

4540.02 --> 4543.9800000000005
ah this can't work like this doesn't

4542.36 --> 4547.12
make any sense

4543.98 --> 4547.12
it's continual

4549.679 --> 4553.9400000000005
doesn't have an edge

4552.199 --> 4557.178999999999
I think that's what's gonna come out and

4553.94 --> 4559.46
I don't even know if like if the looping

4557.179 --> 4562.28
aspect is that

4559.46 --> 4565.82
that's symmetrical

4562.28 --> 4567.38
right or like perfectly rectangular how

4565.82 --> 4571.219
do you know it is that how you know it's

4567.38 --> 4572.96
not some weird kind of aberrant

4571.219 --> 4576.56
irregular

4572.96 --> 4579.44
shape of the realm interconnection like

4576.56 --> 4581.96
it could be pretty weird

4579.44 --> 4584.239
it could be so weird that people in the

4581.96 --> 4586.699
past that figured out that it is that

4584.239 --> 4588.58
where it simply gave it up to try to

4586.699 --> 4592.04
display it

4588.58 --> 4594.86
exactly the way it is because it's just

4592.04 --> 4599.44
too [ __ ] complicated and nobody would

4594.86 --> 4599.44
even accept it for being real

in its hair

4674.84 --> 4677.62

4678.14 --> 4684.26

5064.9 --> 5071.639999999999
the way you said that

5067.12 --> 5071.64
I think he's actually for real

5074.26 --> 5079.900000000001
at least you're only [ __ ] and not

5077.02 --> 5082.02
actually gay so there's still hope for

5079.9 --> 5082.0199999999995
you

5085.98 --> 5091.799999999999
maybe I don't know how long I'm gonna

5088.96 --> 5091.8
hold out guys

5091.96 --> 5095.94
I'm trying to be patient

5096.64 --> 5101.02
but yeah more colored maybe the reason

5098.98 --> 5104.32
why trolls hang around [ __ ] they

5101.02 --> 5106.900000000001
obviously dislike is because

5104.32 --> 5110.04
there's nothing to hang around

5106.9 --> 5110.04
that they like

5110.679 --> 5116.219
yep misery

5112.84 --> 5116.219
tries to find company

5117.46 --> 5122.02
if they'd find something they'd really

5119.56 --> 5124.900000000001
like and they try to become part of it

5122.02 --> 5128.02
then they would feel themselves standing

5124.9 --> 5130.299999999999
out for the miserable little bastard

5128.02 --> 5132.52
that they are

5130.3 --> 5136.12
so they'd rather hang around a place

5132.52 --> 5138.76
where they don't like it so their

5136.12 --> 5141.58
standard misery

5138.76 --> 5143.62
feels more like it's

5141.58 --> 5145.54
in place like it's where it's supposed

5143.62 --> 5146.679
to be it's like oh you're miserable oh

5145.54 --> 5148.42
yeah it's because you're watching

5146.679 --> 5150.6990000000005
something shitty yeah but you watch

5148.42 --> 5153.28
something shitty because it made you

5150.699 --> 5155.699
feel okay with being a miserable piece

5153.28 --> 5155.699
of [ __ ]

5156.04 --> 5162.179
instead of seeking out something that

5158.32 --> 5162.179
actually makes you feel good and

5162.34 --> 5165.179
and all that

5175.6 --> 5179.219
afraid of that's correct

5179.679 --> 5182.679
I don't know how you know that clammy

5181.78 --> 5185.28
but

5182.679 --> 5185.28
sure

5189.94 --> 5194.62
mice are weird though

5192.159 --> 5197.08
I mean they are really weird

5194.62 --> 5200.739
there's something weird about mice and

5197.08 --> 5202.179
and a lot of bugs a lot of Furman

5200.739 --> 5205.12
because

5202.179 --> 5209.639
mice just literally get out of nowhere

5205.12 --> 5209.639
and I mean out of nowhere

5209.679 --> 5217.06
so what they've been living in a hole

5213.76 --> 5220.06
for half a year you literally never

5217.06 --> 5221.320000000001
getting above ground for half a year

5220.06 --> 5223.4800000000005
I mean

5221.32 --> 5225.04
and then they suddenly show up it's

5223.48 --> 5227.879999999999
really weird mice there's something

5225.04 --> 5227.88
weird with mice

5229.0 --> 5232.38
yeah but I'm not scared of them

5232.9 --> 5237.4
I always think just hysterical when

5234.82 --> 5239.099999999999
women get away Mouse this I think it's

5237.4 --> 5241.42
like ah

5239.1 --> 5244.08
unless it's like a really [ __ ] up

5241.42 --> 5247.0
dirty Mouse that's all

5244.08 --> 5249.699
sweaty and panicky and they jump yeah

5247.0 --> 5252.0
when mice bounce around that is a bit

5249.699 --> 5252.0
scary

5252.219 --> 5256.96
as really feral mice those are [ __ ] up

5255.04 --> 5258.28
creatures and like that's dangerous to

5256.96 --> 5259.84
get bitten by those that's very

5258.28 --> 5262.12
dangerous

5259.84 --> 5264.6
you gotta get to a doctor quickly if

5262.12 --> 5264.599999999999
that happens

5264.88 --> 5269.679
or like immediately pour alcohol over

5267.58 --> 5272.82
the wound

5269.679 --> 5272.82
if that's even enough

5273.04 --> 5278.5
but I mean most mice that I don't know

5275.92 --> 5280.719
we bomb bump into here they're just like

5278.5 --> 5282.46
regular amount they look like they just

5280.719 --> 5284.7390000000005
escaped from somebody's cage or

5282.46 --> 5286.2390000000005
something they don't look they look kind

5284.739 --> 5288.459999999999
of faddish

5286.239 --> 5291.239
very comfortable they're not even that

5288.46 --> 5291.2390000000005
scared of people

5303.82 --> 5308.94
a bunch of cat passed them I started

5305.86 --> 5308.94
coming or yeah

5311.5 --> 5317.56
well I get those cats in here and around

5314.52 --> 5318.88
it does help if you just have cats

5317.56 --> 5320.4400000000005
around regularly even if they're not

5318.88 --> 5322.659000000001
your cats

5320.44 --> 5325.839999999999
the mouse the mice will just know that

5322.659 --> 5329.5599999999995
there's cats around and they will

5325.84 --> 5332.34
not feel as free to just hang around and

5329.56 --> 5332.34
get in your face

5334.179 --> 5340.26
would you say is that I don't care

5336.699 --> 5340.259999999999
I don't care who's the biggest troll

5340.48 --> 5344.459999999999
I don't know who they are

5345.1 --> 5349.06
what I don't want to talk about them

5346.78 --> 5351.58
because I don't care about the [ __ ]

5349.06 --> 5352.719
trolls they're just miserable pieces of

5351.58 --> 5354.94
[ __ ]

5352.719 --> 5357.76
that are not interested in information

5354.94 --> 5360.4
at all they're not interested in what I

5357.76 --> 5362.62
actually bring to the table

5360.4 --> 5365.138999999999
they're really just there to try to

5362.62 --> 5368.46
distract away from it from whatever

5365.139 --> 5368.46
subject I'm talking about

5379.78 --> 5385.38
we end up feeding this trays with the

5382.179 --> 5385.38
food my cat is like

5393.94 --> 5401.4
what

5396.28 --> 5401.4
spends more on cat food than him so okay

5404.679 --> 5410.159
be careful that he doesn't become a

5406.659 --> 5410.159
weird old cat man

5411.639 --> 5416.92
I mean if you're if they're gonna spend

5413.86 --> 5419.92
more money on their cat food than on

5416.92 --> 5421.36
their own quality food that's a worrying

5419.92 --> 5423.9
sign a bit

5421.36 --> 5423.9
laughs

5432.52 --> 5436.900000000001
what are you saying you are a troll

5436.9 --> 5440.739
saying well you're [ __ ] [ __ ]

5439.54 --> 5444.46
apparently

5440.739 --> 5448.62
by your own admission so now realize how

5444.46 --> 5448.62
what that implies when you say that

5449.62 --> 5454.42
you're going to say I'm not the biggest

5451.719 --> 5457.9800000000005

5475.6 --> 5479.4400000000005
right might not be your fault but it is

5477.699 --> 5481.919999999999
your responsibility just because you're

5479.44 --> 5485.0199999999995
[ __ ] doesn't mean that you can just

5481.92 --> 5486.6990000000005
get away with acting [ __ ] all the

5485.02 --> 5488.56
time yeah

5486.699 --> 5491.5
I'm not going to lower down the

5488.56 --> 5496.38
standards here just because you can't

5491.5 --> 5496.38
grasp more than you can

5498.94 --> 5503.199
I'm afraid you're gonna have to just

5500.739 --> 5505.379999999999
like see what the best you can make of

5503.199 --> 5505.379999999999
it

5514.36 --> 5520.44
better a weird cat man than a member of

the letter yeah

5520.54 --> 5523.739
I guess Mark

5529.54 --> 5533.0199999999995
yeah don't let your retardedness be a

5531.639 --> 5534.159000000001
handicap

5533.02 --> 5537.219
yeah

5537.219 --> 5547.179
oh I'm I'm this so it's okay oh really

5542.26 --> 5550.54
so you think that your detriment is a

5547.179 --> 5554.4
ticket out of responsibility is it

5550.54 --> 5554.4
no no I don't accept that

right

5709.9 --> 5715.659
it's what do they do

5712.42 --> 5718.4800000000005
they kind of leave that field alone and

5715.659 --> 5723.28
instead start focusing on other more

5718.48 --> 5726.78
fruitful Endeavors about their abilities

5723.28 --> 5726.78
and then they focus on that

5727.42 --> 5737.28
right like I am not gonna focus on math

5733.48 --> 5740.919999999999

6182.28 --> 6186.599999999999
but he's unwilling to concede to that

6185.04 --> 6188.88
fact

6186.6 --> 6191.76
and so he's just gonna

6188.88 --> 6195.5
just create Ruckus

Dell didn't know that there is no

6262.679 --> 6269.219
weekend FTD that's

6264.84 --> 6272.3
I mean come on Dell come on

6269.219 --> 6272.3
this is ridiculous

6287.34 --> 6291.42
yeah I know flatter Sage I I don't know

6289.56 --> 6294.320000000001
what the hell rate she's doing it is

[Music]

6324.679 --> 6329.54
working on the I3 nice we're gonna go

6369.179 --> 6375.0

6376.619 --> 6380.82
yeah

6378.42 --> 6383.28
right it's the same [ __ ] as like

6380.82 --> 6385.86
Mass attracting mass and

6383.28 --> 6387.599999999999
well it's all the same Dell's just

6385.86 --> 6390.739
making the same mistakes that Ballers

6387.6 --> 6390.7390000000005
are making about science

6391.5 --> 6396.03

[Music]

6403.8 --> 6409.1990000000005
that was getting good viewers easy yes

6406.199 --> 6411.719
because he is hating

6409.199 --> 6413.82
and when you attack something that's

6411.719 --> 6418.44
actually really working

6413.82 --> 6421.219
you get the the undead hordes or or the

6418.44 --> 6421.219
ogres or

6421.56 --> 6426.06
you get the Orcs

6423.54 --> 6429.36
there's a lot of them out there they're

6426.06 --> 6433.7390000000005
hordes they're they're massive

6429.36 --> 6435.54
right just look at what uh Jim Bob got

6433.739 --> 6437.82
over the floor

6435.54 --> 6439.8
when you like really started to like

6437.82 --> 6441.48
permanently attack

6439.8 --> 6444.119000000001
Owen Benjamin

6441.48 --> 6447.78
he got a huge amount of people there

6444.119 --> 6450.0599999999995
because those are Orcs you get the hate

6447.78 --> 6452.5199999999995
viewers the people

6450.06 --> 6454.4400000000005
they come with you and they're like yeah

6452.52 --> 6458.46
yeah we're with you oh yeah you're so

6454.44 --> 6460.0199999999995
popular why because you hated a certain

6458.46 --> 6462.659
guy

6460.02 --> 6465.119000000001
those are hate viewers

6462.659 --> 6467.759999999999
that's what you get when you go attack

6465.119 --> 6469.32
something that just rubs a whole bunch

6467.76 --> 6470.76
of people the wrong way you get those

6469.32 --> 6472.199
haters

6470.76 --> 6474.179
and that's what Dell's been getting

6472.199 --> 6477.36
that's why he's supposedly so popular

6474.179 --> 6479.6990000000005
it's because there's probably hundreds

6477.36 --> 6483.839999999999
of thousands of people out there that

6479.699 --> 6484.98
have seen fed and they realize that they

6483.84 --> 6487.6990000000005
lost

6484.98 --> 6490.44
they take in their mind could not

6487.699 --> 6493.199
convincingly win

6490.44 --> 6496.0199999999995
the globe Earth argument

6493.199 --> 6499.739
and then they decided they hate fed and

6496.02 --> 6501.119000000001
they want it destroyed because it wrecks

6499.739 --> 6503.04
their dream and there's nothing they can

6501.119 --> 6505.38
do about it

6503.04 --> 6507.0
there's probably a whole bunch of those

6505.38 --> 6509.219
people out there

6507.0 --> 6511.739
and when somebody's like attacking

6509.219 --> 6514.02
Nathan Oakley or whatever

6511.739 --> 6515.94
suddenly they get on there it's like

6514.02 --> 6518.1
yeah yeah finally you're just gonna

6515.94 --> 6520.5
finally down oh please my God please

6518.1 --> 6522.08
take note that down please we can't

6520.5 --> 6525.0
handle this anymore

6522.08 --> 6527.88
please make it stop

6525.0 --> 6530.46
I need the torture to stop I can't

6527.88 --> 6532.86
handle this [ __ ] truth all the time I

6530.46 --> 6535.44
just want my Globe dream back please get

6532.86 --> 6538.08
him out of here please make him stop

6535.44 --> 6541.138999999999
yeah those are the people that certainly

6538.08 --> 6542.34
pile on when you do that

6541.139 --> 6545.46
yeah

6542.34 --> 6549.2390000000005
but when you die down in your attacking

6545.46 --> 6551.52
of popular figure they will all go away

6549.239 --> 6555.138999999999

they're completely useless

7502.58 --> 7508.34
now that gives a whole new meaning to

7504.92 --> 7508.34
the word transplantary

7508.88 --> 7511.3
okay

7513.88 --> 7519.1990000000005
because but you're right Refugee the

7516.98 --> 7521.959999999999
globe kind of is trans because

7519.199 --> 7525.04
it thinks it's a ball in outer space and

7521.96 --> 7525.04
it's this Superstar

7525.32 --> 7530.44
but it's actually flat in an enclosed

7528.08 --> 7530.44
Realm

7533.599 --> 7539.0
but

7534.82 --> 7543.38
you better tell it it's a globe

7539.0 --> 7547.0
or you or you get banned from Twitter

7543.38 --> 7551.96
right you can't have the right you can't

7547.0 --> 7555.08
use the wrong pronoun for the Earth

7551.96 --> 7559.58
can't just say it like it is that it was

7555.08 --> 7561.86
born flat it's genetically flat

7559.58 --> 7563.659
right

7561.86 --> 7565.46
you can't remind them about that or

7563.659 --> 7567.259999999999
you'll get kicked off Twitter and you'll

7565.46 --> 7569.8
have your bank account blocked and all

7567.26 --> 7569.8
that [ __ ]

7574.159 --> 7581.54
right

7575.86 --> 7583.88
and definitely don't tell trans Earth

7581.54 --> 7585.8
that satellites don't exist

7583.88 --> 7588.38
that they're not necessary because it's

7585.8 --> 7591.099
really flat that's very hurtful to the

7588.38 --> 7591.099
globe yeah

7591.679 --> 7597.52
I mean the globe is stunning and brave

7597.98 --> 7602.718999999999
it's really a globe

7601.639 --> 7605.06
yeah

7602.719 --> 7607.58
don't remind him of how it was born and

7605.06 --> 7611.1990000000005
measured flat that's really

7607.58 --> 7611.199
very homophobic

7618.18 --> 7622.9400000000005
[Music]

7619.46 --> 7625.28
happy yeah you're gay

7622.94 --> 7628.389999999999
you're gay for agreeing with that

7625.28 --> 7628.389999999999
[Music]

7634.26 --> 7638.399
[Music]

7646.639 --> 7648.639
um

7648.76 --> 7652.3
what's going on here

7653.96 --> 7658.76
fourth dimensional Liberace on

7656.54 --> 7661.5199999999995
Rollerblades

7658.76 --> 7663.639
that is hilarious buggy thank you for

7661.52 --> 7663.639
that

7672.679 --> 7680.06
all right so we all need to stop

7676.04 --> 7682.76
telling Earth that it's not a globe that

7680.06 --> 7685.46
was born and measured flat because

7682.76 --> 7688.119000000001
otherwise we risk that they might commit

7685.46 --> 7688.119
suicide

7690.32 --> 7696.159
you're so mean

7692.36 --> 7696.159
don't tell it like it is

7705.44 --> 7710.299999999999
yeah you don't tell

7708.679 --> 7714.82
a globe

7710.3 --> 7714.820000000001
it was born and measured flat

7715.099 --> 7719.26
because

7716.599 --> 7719.26
yeah

7720.139 --> 7724.52
it makes them feel unwanted

7725.119 --> 7730.5199999999995
and then they might the globe might end

7727.46 --> 7732.56
their own life is super tragic

7730.52 --> 7734.719
especially for the Jesuits that

7732.56 --> 7737.659000000001
basically convinced the globe that it

7734.719 --> 7740.78
was a globe using math and all that

7737.659 --> 7743.48
but not telling them that they used flat

7740.78 --> 7744.8
planes to measure it up with and all

7743.48 --> 7747.5
that

7744.8 --> 7749.900000000001
right so first they take the Earth and

7747.5 --> 7752.48
they measure you up like oh like making

7749.9 --> 7754.94
a new clothes for the globe right for

7752.48 --> 7757.759999999999
the Earth and measure it all up and it's

7754.94 --> 7759.5
like yeah well look see we we got a new

7757.76 --> 7762.679
code for you it's like perfectly

7759.5 --> 7764.78
spherical but then they then they don't

7762.679 --> 7767.4800000000005
tell us

7764.78 --> 7769.639
that they actually measured it flat and

7767.48 --> 7772.4
that's why they're so good at measuring

7769.639 --> 7774.4400000000005
it yeah no no but they don't tell the

7772.4 --> 7776.86
globe that right

7774.44 --> 7776.86
because

7777.56 --> 7781.639
the Earth is just

7779.3 --> 7783.38
it's really a globe and it's stunning

7781.639 --> 7786.56
and brave

7783.38 --> 7789.52
don't tell it that it was born and

7786.56 --> 7789.52
measured flat

7800.96 --> 7804.699
I'm gonna make this into a title

7807.32 --> 7817.459

[Applause]

7844.34 --> 7847.0
foreign

7865.28 --> 7872.84
there we go we got a title

7867.92 --> 7876.679
by the way like my show why glasses are

7872.84 --> 7879.860000000001
gay got a huge amount of hits by the way

7876.679 --> 7881.96
apparently there's been tons of people

7879.86 --> 7884.78
that were just like

7881.96 --> 7887.32
they really wanted to know why glasses

7884.78 --> 7887.32
were gay

7888.26 --> 7893.3
I'm seriously like I checked

7890.9 --> 7896.42
with YouTube studio and that one show

7893.3 --> 7899.42
had like a an insane amount of views

7896.42 --> 7901.82
in a very short time it's hilarious

7899.42 --> 7904.4
so I really caught people's attention

7901.82 --> 7907.099
with with that like

7904.4 --> 7909.739
yes it concerns a whole bunch of younger

7907.099 --> 7912.099
kids like whether wearing glasses is gay

7909.739 --> 7912.098999999999
or not

7912.619 --> 7915.739
it was a great show yeah it was a great

7914.599 --> 7918.28
show

7915.739 --> 7918.28
right now

7929.599 --> 7933.92
yeah maybe my show today will have

7932.659 --> 7935.54
similar

7933.92 --> 7938.119
what do you think Richard do you what do

7935.54 --> 7940.639
you think of the title

7938.119 --> 7944.92
the globe is stunning and brave don't

7940.639 --> 7944.92
say it's created and measured flat

7950.54 --> 7955.179
or it hits the same as fuse yeah

7961.159 --> 7967.759999999999
it's people curious to find out

7965.06 --> 7970.159000000001
why glasses are gay

7967.76 --> 7972.139
and apparently there's a whole bunch of

7970.159 --> 7974.92
people that have been really curious

7972.139 --> 7974.92
about that

7978.56 --> 7982.52
and so they checked out my show to see

7980.84 --> 7985.46
if I was actually going to tell them

7982.52 --> 7988.099
quickly why glasses are gay but I mean

7985.46 --> 7990.199
it turns out that that's not like the

7988.099 --> 7992.3
main subject you're gonna delve into at

7990.199 --> 7994.098999999999
the beginning of the show so there's not

7992.3 --> 7995.900000000001
a lot of people that were like watching

7994.099 --> 7999.02
Beyond the first

7995.9 --> 8002.0199999999995
15 minutes

7999.02 --> 8005.139
but there were a lot of people curious

8002.02 --> 8009.46
enough to actually click my show to see

8005.139 --> 8012.52
if I if they would find why glasses are

8009.46 --> 8015.579
wearing glasses is gay

8012.52 --> 8018.040000000001
now if they'd actually stuck to it then

8015.579 --> 8020.619
they would have gotten to that point in

8018.04 --> 8023.26
the video much later like halfway where

8020.619 --> 8025.598999999999
I would literally talk about it for like

8023.26 --> 8028.54
half an hour to an hour about why

8025.599 --> 8030.9400000000005
wearing glasses are gay in detail

8028.54 --> 8034.079
so the people that really wanted to know

8030.94 --> 8034.079
they would have found it

8036.639 --> 8043.96
but it's just funny that

8039.82 --> 8045.28
that one show got a lot of hits very

8043.96 --> 8046.52
quickly

8045.28 --> 8048.34
unexpectedly

8046.52 --> 8051.159000000001
[Music]

8048.34 --> 8053.26
and I've just been thinking why and I

8051.159 --> 8056.5
think that well I guess there is a lot

8053.26 --> 8057.579000000001
of kids that are really curious as to

8056.5 --> 8060.579
why

8057.579 --> 8062.32
if wearing glasses makes you gay or

8060.579 --> 8066.099
whether it's not it's like whether it's

8062.32 --> 8068.199
cool or not right in that sense

8066.099 --> 8072.9400000000005
or however you see whether you see gay

8068.199 --> 8076.299999999999
as cool or gay is not cool or dude

8072.94 --> 8080.0199999999995
it can be quite freaking weird

8076.3 --> 8083.139
how kids and teens deal with that [ __ ]

8080.02 --> 8085.599
and I remember because when I was

8083.139 --> 8089.6990000000005
dealing with that [ __ ] it was really

8085.599 --> 8089.6990000000005
[ __ ] weird and confusing even to me

8093.82 --> 8098.679
I mean some

8095.86 --> 8100.78
groups would say gay is cool and others

8098.679 --> 8102.579
would say that gay is terrible and it's

8100.78 --> 8107.099
like I I just

8102.579 --> 8107.099
it wasn't just really confusing to me

8110.88 --> 8116.82
okay walking man thank you for that

8117.34 --> 8121.7390000000005
is there any reason why we need to know

8119.5 --> 8121.739
that

8148.96 --> 8154.36
I had a gravity one first

8151.9 --> 8158.0199999999995
yeah but that's just because literally

8154.36 --> 8160.299999999999
the word gay is in gravity

8158.02 --> 8163.9800000000005
it's basically

8160.3 --> 8163.9800000000005
gay R of it

8166.29 --> 8173.579
[Music]

8168.84 --> 8173.579
Arvid gay that's what gravity is

8174.04 --> 8178.0199999999995
but yeah anagram I guess

8179.199 --> 8184.839999999999
but I mean Axel Rose is a name it's a

8182.619 --> 8186.46
name that's been used by the way so it's

8184.84 --> 8188.6990000000005
not like the first time I've even hear

8186.46 --> 8188.699
that

8188.8 --> 8196.26
isn't Axel Rose like a

8192.34 --> 8196.26
in some action movie or something

8197.559 --> 8200.399
I don't know

8210.519 --> 8215.16
guns and oh okay ride

8216.96 --> 8220.139
I guess

8234.28 --> 8241.54
the word ass is in glasses that's

8236.8 --> 8243.639
hilarious and appeal thank you for that

8241.54 --> 8246.939
there's another reason why wearing

8243.639 --> 8249.039999999999
glasses it makes you gay this is this is

8246.939 --> 8252.16
hysterical thank you so much for that

8249.04 --> 8254.740000000002
Emma field that made my day

8252.16 --> 8257.219
after all this bickering and This Global

8254.74 --> 8257.219
[ __ ]

8258.28 --> 8263.979000000001
and clammy turning out to be a scummy

8261.099 --> 8266.019
astral after all

8263.979 --> 8268.84
it's really funny that you just said

8266.019 --> 8272.18
that that really

8268.84 --> 8274.960000000001
helped me out in my mood

8272.18 --> 8277.300000000001
[Music]

8274.96 --> 8278.5
hey Mojo I've been liking the show is

8277.3 --> 8281.018999999998
recently cool

8278.5 --> 8282.58
yeah me too I'm in a pretty good mood I

8281.019 --> 8285.519
feel strong I've had a lot of new

8282.58 --> 8288.219
confidence first wave Confidence from

8285.519 --> 8290.92
GTI sort of seeming to work although

8288.219 --> 8293.259999999998
it's kind of like back in the

8290.92 --> 8296.2
slow burner

8293.26 --> 8298.84
and now with basically the country my

8296.2 --> 8301.240000000002
country seeming to go into the final

8298.84 --> 8304.899
Purge of the cartel

8301.24 --> 8307.24
it it seems to finally be happening now

8304.899 --> 8309.46
there's a lot of people coming out with

8307.24 --> 8311.859
massive criticism and

8309.46 --> 8315.219
like it's real like it's like the a dam

8311.859 --> 8318.04
has suddenly cracked and it's like

8315.219 --> 8320.259999999998
it's starting to wash it

8318.04 --> 8323.139000000001
like Lord of the Rings

8320.26 --> 8325.359
The Two Towers right with Saruman after

8323.139 --> 8327.58
the ants attack and break the dam it's

8325.359 --> 8329.439
it's starting to feel like it could be

8327.58 --> 8332.26
that like this that could actually be

8329.439 --> 8334.300000000001
I've been very reserved about it but it

8332.26 --> 8335.979
may actually happen now

8334.3 --> 8339.58
finally

8335.979 --> 8339.58
and after decades

8345.219 --> 8349.32
and yeah there's such good hopes

8349.719 --> 8356.259999999998
really fuel my spirit a lot

8353.139 --> 8358.24
it really does because it gives me an

8356.26 --> 8360.219000000001
Outlook of hey all these things that

8358.24 --> 8362.26
I've kind of abandoned because the world

8360.219 --> 8366.399
has become so [ __ ] up

8362.26 --> 8368.800000000001
there might now be a chance to rekindle

8366.399 --> 8372.34
that seed again

8368.8 --> 8374.858999999999
there might be a chance for that to not

8372.34 --> 8377.2
die off permanently because the world's

8374.859 --> 8378.399000000001
so [ __ ] off right and that gives me a

8377.2 --> 8381.54
lot of

8378.399 --> 8381.539999999999
hope energy

8382.54 --> 8386.320000000002
which is like keeming energy

8384.939 --> 8389.76
it

8386.32 --> 8389.76
how do you say that

8390.0 --> 8398.889
how do you say that in English

8391.94 --> 8398.889000000001
[Music]

8398.939 --> 8403.78
Germany is that germinating

8401.62 --> 8405.880000000001
that's weird

8403.78 --> 8408.34
yeah germinating it's like germinating

8405.88 --> 8410.32
seeds

8408.34 --> 8413.859
that's what that kind of stuff does to

8410.32 --> 8417.279999999999
me energy wise I mean hope like really

8413.859 --> 8421.08
unchains a whole bunch of Grove energy

8417.28 --> 8421.08
it's very constructive in nature

8429.7 --> 8436.300000000001
yeah germinating in Dutch is given

8434.02 --> 8438.1
so that's why I use that word I didn't

8436.3 --> 8439.779999999999
know what it was in English but

8438.1 --> 8443.5
apparently that's germinating really

8439.78 --> 8445.300000000001
weird by the way like German like

8443.5 --> 8447.28
why why

8445.3 --> 8450.599999999999
okay fine

8447.28 --> 8450.6
apparently it's germinating

8452.439 --> 8459.1
I think a new CPU arrived this week yeah

8455.02 --> 8460.66
Nathan said that it would arrive this

8459.1 --> 8464.34
Wednesday

8460.66 --> 8464.34
that's what he said yesterday anyway

8472.08 --> 8478.84
and what

8475.42 --> 8480.76
I don't think Adam actually fixes

8478.84 --> 8482.08
Nathan's computer

8480.76 --> 8484.42
Roxy

8482.08 --> 8487.3
[Music]

8484.42 --> 8488.56
he's a pharmacist not a computer repair

8487.3 --> 8491.039999999999
shop

8488.56 --> 8491.039999999999
person

8511.54 --> 8518.560000000001
you didn't say out

8514.72 --> 8520.539999999999
or you didn't say that I never said that

8518.56 --> 8523.92
I'll read a steamy traveler said that

8520.54 --> 8523.92
yeah you're right Moxie sorry

8527.08 --> 8530.58
Adam was a hat

8534.52 --> 8540.66
is that a Transformers G1 reference

8547.12 --> 8551.160000000002
or is that like a teacher reference

8553.18 --> 8558.1
I mean he is also the Emissary to the

8555.76 --> 8562.319
ethereans

8558.1 --> 8562.319
that's kind of an official title

8565.0 --> 8569.859
principle okay I don't know if he's a

8567.7 --> 8572.140000000001
principal uh

8569.859 --> 8574.359
teacher yeah I know that's a teacher

8572.14 --> 8578.46
reference but

8574.359 --> 8578.460000000001
I don't know why though

8589.84 --> 8593.460000000001
Matthew debate

8593.7 --> 8596.939
oh okay

8597.28 --> 8601.979000000001
really all right I forgot

8606.939 --> 8612.1
right but uh yeah guys I've been going

8609.64 --> 8615.279999999999
over two hours now which usually doesn't

8612.1 --> 8617.800000000001
happen on a weekday show but Nathan's

8615.28 --> 8619.960000000001
computer unfortunately crashed

8617.8 --> 8624.46
so there's not probably not going to be

8619.96 --> 8626.74
a live fed deal today entirely

8624.46 --> 8630.519999999999
and there's a chance not tomorrow either

8626.74 --> 8632.5
because it's probably gonna get fixed

8630.52 --> 8634.899000000001
but I mean the early bird show is going

8632.5 --> 8636.64
to still be here

8634.899 --> 8638.74
so

8636.64 --> 8642.58
if you're

8638.74 --> 8648.0
eager for a conversation

8642.58 --> 8648.0
then yeah you can always visit my chat

8654.58 --> 8658.68
teach post graduate oh cool

8659.5 --> 8665.76
oh so you are actually a teacher a bit

8663.04 --> 8665.76
on the side

8671.8 --> 8677.08
mix with more Yeah well yeah I mean I

8675.04 --> 8679.060000000001
bet Adam has a lot of really good

8677.08 --> 8682.72
knowledge

8679.06 --> 8684.46
in his field and yeah just like with

8682.72 --> 8688.899
doctors you never really stopped

8684.46 --> 8691.899
learning there's always more to learn so

8688.899 --> 8694.18
like an old professional that's really

8691.899 --> 8696.819
smart in developing is very valuable

8694.18 --> 8699.220000000001
they can have a lot of useful

8696.819 --> 8701.8
information for the younger generation

8699.22 --> 8705.099999999999
and save them a whole bunch of hassle

8701.8 --> 8708.779999999999
to get to that point with tips so yeah

8705.1 --> 8708.78
makes perfect sense

8713.26 --> 8716.22
tutor huh

8724.859 --> 8732.58
pharmacist tutor you know that

8728.68 --> 8735.58
that really does kind of sound like a

8732.58 --> 8738.52
a wizard doesn't it

8735.58 --> 8740.7
pharmacist tutor

8738.52 --> 8740.7
um

8743.14 --> 8748.449999999999
is that what we call wizard in modern

8746.74 --> 8751.639
times

8748.45 --> 8751.639000000001
[Music]

8751.96 --> 8754.72
Adam

8753.64 --> 8757.899
thank you

8754.72 --> 8760.8
drug dealer no it's a tutor

8757.899 --> 8760.8
teacher

8763.359 --> 8768.960000000001
that dealer is just a Salesman

8766.3 --> 8768.96
George

8785.16 --> 8790.78
now chemical Assessor

8788.979 --> 8794.199999999999
fair enough

8790.78 --> 8797.02
but I mean it you gotta give it is like

8794.2 --> 8799.240000000002
it is like Wizard or

8797.02 --> 8803.560000000001
like

8799.24 --> 8806.68
it sounds like a description that would

8803.56 --> 8810.22
have people potentially take on the

8806.68 --> 8813.28
title like Sorcerer's Apprentice

8810.22 --> 8815.619999999999
or something when they when they have

8813.28 --> 8818.5
you as a teacher

8815.62 --> 8820.720000000001
because it is I mean

8818.5 --> 8822.04
pharmacia you know it is technically

8820.72 --> 8825.039999999999
sorcery

8822.04 --> 8826.960000000001
so if you're like a pharmacia teacher

8825.04 --> 8831.220000000001
you're like a sorceress teacher that

8826.96 --> 8832.72
means you have like sorcerer students

8831.22 --> 8836.14
I don't know

8832.72 --> 8838.84
maybe it's sort of wishful thinking on

8836.14 --> 8840.84
my side Warlock and warlock deals with

8838.84 --> 8844.76
demons that's different

8840.84 --> 8844.76
[Music]

8846.88 --> 8853.358999999999
now as a sorcerer you might be privy to

8850.24 --> 8855.46
drugs that would involve you in demonic

8853.359 --> 8857.2
interaction and then you could be a

8855.46 --> 8859.839999999998
warlock

8857.2 --> 8861.939
but that's not necessarily

8859.84 --> 8864.460000000001
what you would be

8861.939 --> 8866.02
from Ikea can lead to a lot of healing

8864.46 --> 8869.38
too

8866.02 --> 8871.800000000001
right magic can be used for good and for

8869.38 --> 8871.8
evil

8871.96 --> 8875.519999999999
and so can sorcery

8880.12 --> 8884.740000000002
although if you're really gonna use

8882.16 --> 8887.02
sorcery in a spiritual level you're

8884.74 --> 8890.26
probably not really going to be able to

8887.02 --> 8893.1
exact positive change with that

8890.26 --> 8893.1
on the long run

8922.24 --> 8925.24
foreign

8926.14 --> 8931.539999999999
yo George what the [ __ ] up with your

8928.3 --> 8932.858999999999
attitude could you please

8931.54 --> 8937.439
just

8932.859 --> 8937.439
take it easy on that a mirror okay

8937.84 --> 8941.819
would be my title

8944.979 --> 8948.06
the oracle

8956.92 --> 8961.54
The Seer

8958.54 --> 8961.54
dreamwalker

8965.68 --> 8971.819
traveler of the planes Beyond

8969.16 --> 8971.819
I don't know

8976.359 --> 8982.439
but I mean yeah Oracle and dreamwalker

8978.819 --> 8984.819
would be for me the most direct

8982.439 --> 8987.16
appropriate title since those are like

8984.819 --> 8989.859
the things that I do actually that's

8987.16 --> 8993.479
actually describing what I do

8989.859 --> 8993.479000000001
I gave it those names

8993.64 --> 8999.699999999999
to describe the process that I do

8997.859 --> 9002.6
dreamwalking

8999.7 --> 9002.6
Oracle

9013.9 --> 9020.1
[Music]

9016.92 --> 9022.8
yeah now as yeah George I mean seriously

9020.1 --> 9027.26
like Adam probably prevented more

9022.8 --> 9027.259999999998
British people from getting killed than

9027.66 --> 9032.3
than any other pharmacist in the country

9032.7 --> 9040.1
and he did it all legally and

9036.78 --> 9044.76
and even like within the the

9040.1 --> 9045.45
flexibility of these crazy new rules so

9044.76 --> 9046.74
yeah

9045.45 --> 9048.6
[Music]

9046.74 --> 9050.039999999999
but England's very lucky to have Adam

9048.6 --> 9053.06
again

9050.04 --> 9053.060000000001
a guy like that

9069.479 --> 9073.619999999999
all right this is going to turn into a

9072.0 --> 9076.399
three-hour show

9073.62 --> 9076.399000000001
laughs

9077.1 --> 9084.359
why not maybe nah not for too long I

9082.2 --> 9085.800000000001
cook groceries later all right I hope

9084.359 --> 9089.899000000001
you're all enjoying the show though

9085.8 --> 9089.899
except for clammy you don't give a [ __ ]

9096.12 --> 9100.62
just for somebody who supposedly is such

9098.7 --> 9103.140000000001
a big fan of the show why do you bring

9100.62 --> 9105.060000000001
up all these terrible things like the

9103.14 --> 9107.34
terrible aspects

9105.06 --> 9110.22
about my show

9107.34 --> 9113.16
without any sense of feeling about them

9110.22 --> 9116.84
like they are the normal things that's

9113.16 --> 9116.84
what a troll does I just

9123.84 --> 9127.43
like why would you do that other than to

9126.96 --> 9130.319
troll

9127.43 --> 9134.1
[Music]

9130.319 --> 9136.26
it's like what why do it it's just so

9134.1 --> 9140.359
frustrating to me I thought it was

9136.26 --> 9140.359
actually going to be a regular person

9142.819 --> 9148.199999999999
wizard of Clary

9145.439 --> 9150.54
that I feel very honored that you title

9148.2 --> 9152.7
me that steamy Traveler

9150.54 --> 9156.26
but I don't think others would really

9152.7 --> 9156.26
agree to that as much

9168.479 --> 9171.319
heartless

9175.38 --> 9179.699999999999
what streets what are you mentioning

9177.24 --> 9183.06
what do you think that clammy was

9179.7 --> 9186.08
heartless or that I'm heartless

9183.06 --> 9186.08
what are you saying

9196.439 --> 9202.18
are you having a delay

9198.91 --> 9202.18
[Music]

9206.64 --> 9209.3
damn it

9212.1 --> 9215.66
what the hell is wrong with it

9217.62 --> 9220.92
yo

9219.06 --> 9226.14
that was weird

9220.92 --> 9228.24
title was off is a stunning a brave that

9226.14 --> 9232.16
was weird

9228.24 --> 9232.16
I corrected it now the title

9235.08 --> 9241.979
ah prestidigitated perception yeah I I

9238.979 --> 9244.438999999998
can pronounce that word animekin

9241.979 --> 9245.938999999998
I had a lot of practice though press the

9244.439 --> 9247.939
digitation

9245.939 --> 9250.5
because prestidated

9247.939 --> 9251.819
prestidigitation is like one of the most

9250.5 --> 9254.1
important

9251.819 --> 9255.6
can trip spells within Dungeons and

9254.1 --> 9257.76
Dragons

9255.6 --> 9260.04
it's really important you literally use

9257.76 --> 9264.06
that to clean yourself off and to like

9260.04 --> 9265.5
write visuals in the in the air in front

9264.06 --> 9268.619999999999
of you

9265.5 --> 9270.54
all kinds and like very minor

9268.62 --> 9274.439
telekinesis

9270.54 --> 9278.899000000001
so yeah press the digitation is like

9274.439 --> 9278.899
a word that I've said many many times

9280.439 --> 9286.02
oh you meant for me provider of press

9283.8 --> 9288.179999999998
the digital

9286.02 --> 9290.42
but I mean it is like nobody's going to

9288.18 --> 9295.64
be able to pronounce that though

9290.42 --> 9295.64
provider of prestidigitated perception

9300.28 --> 9305.6
[Music]

9302.76 --> 9305.6
ppv

9313.08 --> 9316.979
all right I appreciate it though I do my

9315.78 --> 9318.6
best

9316.979 --> 9322.099999999999
do my best

9318.6 --> 9322.1
that's all I can really do

9328.26 --> 9333.800000000001
conquering tricks performed as

9330.54 --> 9333.800000000001
entertainment what

9341.76 --> 9349.1
it did seem very personal

9346.5 --> 9349.1
what

9349.5 --> 9354.12
but I don't understand straight good to

9352.38 --> 9356.64
say that you're new

9354.12 --> 9358.02
but I don't understand exactly what was

9356.64 --> 9360.18
heartless you just said the word

9358.02 --> 9361.74
heartless but I don't know what exactly

9360.18 --> 9366.24
was heartless

9361.74 --> 9369.84
and your clarification is a it

9366.24 --> 9371.88
very personal it's not clarifying what

9369.84 --> 9375.62
is heartless

9371.88 --> 9375.619999999999
something I said heartless

9384.899 --> 9390.539999999999
the empathy empathic seer

9388.56 --> 9392.279999999999
yeah

9390.54 --> 9393.720000000001
although there's probably a whole bunch

9392.28 --> 9398.34
of people out there that would like

9393.72 --> 9401.519999999999
adamantly oppose the notion of empathy

9398.34 --> 9403.979
because they see empathy as somebody oh

9401.52 --> 9405.84
there's very like close to you and it's

9403.979 --> 9408.14
very loving and caring yeah but that's

9405.84 --> 9408.14
not

9408.359 --> 9414.78
I am an empath that means I have an

9411.78 --> 9417.78
inherent sensory ability

9414.78 --> 9420.12
doesn't mean that I'm like oh I love

9417.78 --> 9422.78
everybody like that's not

9420.12 --> 9422.78
me

9425.399 --> 9428.84
am I empathetic

9431.46 --> 9436.259999999998
like

9433.14 --> 9440.0
in the descriptory sense of the word am

9436.26 --> 9440.0
I empathetic that's a question

9448.02 --> 9451.800000000001
there are certain like if the chemistry

9450.12 --> 9453.720000000001
is right everybody's honest and

9451.8 --> 9455.399
somebody's like coming in that we all

9453.72 --> 9457.5
like and they had like a really [ __ ]

9455.399 --> 9461.519999999999
up day or something terrible happen

9457.5 --> 9464.16
then yes I will absolutely be empathetic

9461.52 --> 9466.140000000001
I will be like almost like try to be

9464.16 --> 9467.819
like a mom or something like to try to

9466.14 --> 9469.16
help them out stabilize them and just

9467.819 --> 9473.1
make them feel like they're not alone

9469.16 --> 9476.88
yeah in that sense I am empathetic

9473.1 --> 9479.640000000001
but if I don't trust a person and they

9476.88 --> 9481.74
try to kind of force that kind of

9479.64 --> 9485.22
behavior out they just want to connect

9481.74 --> 9487.5
but they they don't want it naturally

9485.22 --> 9488.34
they they want to like their ego wants

9487.5 --> 9492.72
it

9488.34 --> 9495.42
then it can be very apathetic

9492.72 --> 9498.72
once I start distrusting I can be very

9495.42 --> 9501.72
very empathetic like

9498.72 --> 9501.72
unempathetic

9502.2 --> 9508.140000000001
like what clammy did

9505.2 --> 9510.42
Grammy first started to grow on me a

9508.14 --> 9513.539999999999
little but then just the more he did

9510.42 --> 9516.0
that sort of like oops I accidentally

9513.54 --> 9519.720000000001
backstabbed you I guess I didn't know

9516.0 --> 9522.42
that would happen and he kept doing that

9519.72 --> 9525.899
and then it's just like

9522.42 --> 9529.979
boom now it's gonna be merciless

9525.899 --> 9532.8
now suddenly the the entire scenario to

9529.979 --> 9534.96
me emotionally switched around from a

9532.8 --> 9538.56
bit of an awkward guy that's just trying

9534.96 --> 9541.259999999998
to look for a place to stay into yeah I

9538.56 --> 9544.34
mean yeah I'm actually an SS officer and

9541.26 --> 9544.34
you are in my camp

9544.979 --> 9548.699999999999
that's kind of my attitude change from

9547.439 --> 9551.720000000001
that point on

9548.7 --> 9551.720000000001
it's like yeah

9552.84 --> 9558.06
I'm not gonna empathize with you anymore

9556.68 --> 9560.76
because

9558.06 --> 9563.06
there's some inerredeemable quality

9560.76 --> 9563.06
there

9571.28 --> 9578.76
empathic is not empathetic

9574.979 --> 9581.039999999999
that's a good point for this boy

9578.76 --> 9583.460000000001
I do sometimes have a tendency to mix

9581.04 --> 9583.460000000001
them up

9586.5 --> 9590.28
tick

9588.12 --> 9594.2
yeah it's just it's just the only

9590.28 --> 9594.2
difference is in ET isn't it

9599.16 --> 9607.619999999999
an empathic pathic

9603.0 --> 9609.8
is like much better than pathetic isn't

9607.62 --> 9609.800000000001
it

9612.6 --> 9620.28
if you're a pathic that would be like

9616.8 --> 9621.66
you do something automatically

9620.28 --> 9626.460000000001
right

9621.66 --> 9631.619999999999
pathic pathos pathos is like is like

9626.46 --> 9637.319
sort of to act I think the action pathos

9631.62 --> 9639.6
but pathetic we know that word

9637.319 --> 9641.039999999999
separately has a completely different

9639.6 --> 9643.56
meaning

9641.04 --> 9644.899000000001
so it's like yeah I'm empathetic

9643.56 --> 9648.96
that's

9644.899 --> 9651.68
within the word actually a notification

9648.96 --> 9651.679999999998
of weakness

9651.72 --> 9655.8
you're basically saying like yeah I am

9653.76 --> 9658.5
empathetic with you that means like yeah

9655.8 --> 9659.699999999999
I am kind of weak in the face of what

9658.5 --> 9663.66
you do

9659.7 --> 9667.140000000001
like I'm not strongly in opposition

9663.66 --> 9669.119999999999
so you're empathetic like yeah I can

9667.14 --> 9671.279999999999
feel with you

9669.12 --> 9674.160000000002
what it is technically a form of

9671.28 --> 9679.439
pathetic it is

9674.16 --> 9682.8
well empathic is you can literally feel

9679.439 --> 9687.479000000001
whether it's real or not about them

9682.8 --> 9689.519999999999
but you will also feel the actual pain

9687.479 --> 9692.34
from that process it's like you

9689.52 --> 9695.1
literally get in their boots in their

9692.34 --> 9698.04
position and you feel it like they feel

9695.1 --> 9699.899000000001
it that's empathy that's real empathic

9698.04 --> 9701.819000000001
power

9699.899 --> 9704.699999999999
and it is a detriment

9701.819 --> 9707.519999999999
yeah it's not just like oh I like to

9704.7 --> 9710.880000000001
think about that person and be really

9707.52 --> 9712.859
sympathetic and like oh so so poor Oh I

9710.88 --> 9714.119999999999
wanna help right well that's kind of

9712.859 --> 9716.16
pathetic

9714.12 --> 9717.54
you don't really know whether they're

9716.16 --> 9719.88
acting or not

9717.54 --> 9723.12
or you're an empath you can [ __ ] feel

9719.88 --> 9726.319
it you can feel somebody's acting

9723.12 --> 9726.319000000001
or whether it's real

9728.28 --> 9736.26
wizard of etymology that's

9732.319 --> 9739.5
yeah no no I might be in etymology

9736.26 --> 9742.62
Enthusiast but I'm definitely no wizard

9739.5 --> 9746.899
I had things just blatantly incorrect

9742.62 --> 9746.899000000001
can't really claim Wizards [ __ ] then

9760.08 --> 9762.56
all right

9772.34 --> 9778.380000000001
now maybe if I'd ever get to a point

9775.26 --> 9780.66
where I would prove my conception to

9778.38 --> 9783.42
then be a theory I guess or not a theory

9780.66 --> 9786.42
it's a what is question not a what does

9783.42 --> 9789.42
what if I could ever actually prove that

9786.42 --> 9792.02
light is an infinitely divisible

9789.42 --> 9795.18
being

9792.02 --> 9799.5
instantaneous of energy

9795.18 --> 9802.28
then I might call myself wizard of

9799.5 --> 9802.28
holography

9802.439 --> 9807.84
that would be pretty cool title to have

9805.319 --> 9808.88
I would definitely take the title wizard

9807.84 --> 9811.979
of holography

9808.88 --> 9815.039999999999
[Music]

9811.979 --> 9817.319
I mean holographic son

9815.04 --> 9822.68
right

9817.319 --> 9822.68
light nature it is what it is

9823.74 --> 9831.14
and I mean it sounds very cool

9827.42 --> 9831.14
wizard of holography

9841.68 --> 9849.06
all right anyway man been almost

9845.88 --> 9852.38
two hour 41 minutes

9849.06 --> 9852.38
21 watching

9852.6 --> 9858.74
hope you're all enjoying the show

9855.3 --> 9858.74
it's a bit over the place

9861.42 --> 9864.8
I got a good title though

9867.0 --> 9872.95
I thought it was hilarious

9869.74 --> 9872.949999999999
[Music]

9888.359 --> 9893.04
during the show glad to hear a dank now

9890.46 --> 9895.259999999998
I've been enjoying the show too

9893.04 --> 9898.2
except for the clammy part

9895.26 --> 9900.68
still wearing on me I find it very

9898.2 --> 9900.68
annoying

9907.92 --> 9911.819
but it's really because I just can't

9910.08 --> 9916.8
seriously figure out whether the person

9911.819 --> 9919.74
was just genuinely like a

9916.8 --> 9922.14
Peter from Family Guy level [ __ ]

9919.74 --> 9924.72
about these things or whether it's just

9922.14 --> 9927.18
a troll taking cover under being

9924.72 --> 9929.58
[ __ ] just so he could poke me more I

9927.18 --> 9932.819
I couldn't sense it

9929.58 --> 9935.22
the guy might actually be that dumb

9932.819 --> 9937.38
which is a tragedy on its own if that's

9935.22 --> 9939.899
real but it doesn't make it more

9937.38 --> 9942.56
palatable if it were it's still

9939.899 --> 9942.56
intenable

9942.66 --> 9946.619999999999
if that's real then that person's

9944.939 --> 9950.300000000001
probably having a lot of trouble making

9946.62 --> 9950.300000000001
serious friends out there in the world

9953.58 --> 9957.899
eye out for the next clip I don't think

9955.74 --> 9960.42
he makes soccer counts slo-mo moon buggy

9957.899 --> 9963.479
I don't think he's a soccer count person

9960.42 --> 9967.8
's been around for a long time I

9963.479 --> 9967.8
remember him in like from 2017.

9971.64 --> 9977.479
I think he might actually be a long-term

9974.04 --> 9977.479000000001
fan it's just that

9978.54 --> 9981.800000000001
it's pointless

9991.08 --> 9997.22
didn't realize that yeah it doesn't

9994.2 --> 9997.220000000001
really matter too much

9997.979 --> 10003.92
I mean if taking that into account it's

10001.28 --> 10008.300000000001
even more stupid

10003.92 --> 10010.76
right to ask such things the way he did

10008.3 --> 10012.5
it makes it worse

10010.76 --> 10015.380000000001
the fact that he's been watching that

10012.5 --> 10017.56
long you should know better you should

10015.38 --> 10020.72
know better from

10017.56 --> 10023.119999999999
empiricism from literally the experience

10020.72 --> 10026.119999999999
going through me and what I go through

10023.12 --> 10027.26
how I think my race you should know

10026.12 --> 10031.0
better

10027.26 --> 10031.0
even if you are kind of stupid

10036.92 --> 10040.88
felt like you were strolling when you

10038.54 --> 10043.220000000001
first yes I know

10040.88 --> 10044.539999999999
and you do have that sense yes and so

10043.22 --> 10046.819
did I

10044.54 --> 10049.76
but then it seemed like it was just

10046.819 --> 10052.58
doing his best to behave

10049.76 --> 10057.14
because clammy never went full gamma he

10052.58 --> 10058.939
never went like rage gamma on us right

10057.14 --> 10061.64
that's the big difference

10058.939 --> 10063.439
most trolls won't go rage gamma

10061.64 --> 10066.8
immediately

10063.439 --> 10068.84
and then it's very easy to kick them out

10066.8 --> 10071.24
once you spot that

10068.84 --> 10074.74
clammy didn't do that doesn't do that I

10071.24 --> 10074.74
don't think he even did that in the past

10076.34 --> 10081.7
got Rocket Man fights from Grammy

10079.22 --> 10081.699999999999
Maybe

10083.54 --> 10088.1
but I don't think so

10085.52 --> 10091.7
I don't think it's the same

10088.1 --> 10095.66
Rocket Man does actually have gamma

10091.7 --> 10099.5
questions and impulses like that

10095.66 --> 10102.619999999999
like he has agitated responses clammy

10099.5 --> 10105.02
did you read it because

10102.62 --> 10107.359
Glam is literally like trying to make

10105.02 --> 10110.08
excuses but then it just it doesn't do

10107.359 --> 10110.08
it effectively

10119.56 --> 10125.24
been a bit of a detriment to me I

10122.0 --> 10128.42
thought yeah but that always is

10125.24 --> 10131.32
Embassy is a great skill but there is a

10128.42 --> 10134.61
very pronounced downside to it

10131.32 --> 10134.61
[Music]

10138.02 --> 10144.460000000001
it's a lifelong development task to have

10142.22 --> 10144.46
it

10146.54 --> 10152.12
but I mean any empaths should still be

10149.78 --> 10153.92
glad of their empathy despite the

10152.12 --> 10156.460000000001
struggle you know why because when you

10153.92 --> 10161.02
get older when you get much older

10156.46 --> 10164.119999999999
you'll still feel like you're very young

10161.02 --> 10166.1
compared to those that didn't have

10164.12 --> 10168.979000000001
natural empathy throughout their life

10166.1 --> 10173.18
and throughout time have seen their

10168.979 --> 10175.039999999999
feelings just worn and stripped and

10173.18 --> 10176.720000000001
taken from them and they'd be like oh

10175.04 --> 10180.740000000002
that's just business you're just what we

10176.72 --> 10182.96
do and when they're old they feel old

10180.74 --> 10185.899
and they don't have the energy anymore

10182.96 --> 10188.779999999999
an empath that has managed to not get

10185.899 --> 10191.24
themselves killed or insane when they're

10188.78 --> 10193.640000000001
older they're still young

10191.24 --> 10197.24
that's the difference

10193.64 --> 10200.5
so if you survive being an empath

10197.24 --> 10203.84
then you have a a very

10200.5 --> 10206.08
interesting latter life to look forward

10203.84 --> 10206.08
to

10206.54 --> 10210.52
that's the promise I can give you

10207.979 --> 10210.519999999999
Richard G

10214.04 --> 10218.12
you'll still feel super young you might

10216.56 --> 10221.359
look a little older but you'll still

10218.12 --> 10223.28
feel actually feel super young compared

10221.359 --> 10223.76
to those of your same age that don't

10223.28 --> 10226.959
have it

10223.76 --> 10226.959
[Music]

10233.72 --> 10236.38
what

10240.1 --> 10245.06
I don't know who the what the [ __ ] are

10242.72 --> 10246.74
you talking about weirdo get the [ __ ]

10245.06 --> 10249.939
out

10246.74 --> 10249.939
what the hell was that

10251.98 --> 10255.279999999999
[Music]

10269.359 --> 10273.77
you see

10271.399 --> 10275.779999999999
what the [ __ ] is that

10273.77 --> 10280.28
[Music]

10275.78 --> 10284.62
your 33 feels to still feel like 18 yes

10280.28 --> 10284.62
well so did I flatter Sage

10284.72 --> 10293.319
I still felt like a teenager

10288.02 --> 10293.319000000001
pretty much till I was 30

10293.72 --> 10300.14
yeah 33 actually is a pretty good yeah

10297.8 --> 10302.0
what I mean then my ex broke up with me

10300.14 --> 10304.58
and everything got all [ __ ] up and

10302.0 --> 10307.18
then that did kind of age me a bit

10304.58 --> 10307.18
inside

10307.22 --> 10314.179999999998
just a bit

10309.62 --> 10315.800000000001
now I'm 43 and I feel like a solid

10314.18 --> 10318.800000000001
25

10315.8 --> 10318.8
28.

10323.0 --> 10328.479
besides I feel much better it's much

10325.819 --> 10332.359
better to actually feel 25

10328.479 --> 10334.88
28 compared to 18. because yeah when

10332.359 --> 10336.800000000001
you're 18 you got a lot of they don't

10334.88 --> 10339.14
want to squirt anymore let's get them

10336.8 --> 10341.119999999999
and let's get the chicks and let's brawl

10339.14 --> 10344.24
and you want to all do it but you're

10341.12 --> 10347.960000000001
also usually kind of a [ __ ] idiot

10344.24 --> 10350.539999999999
compared to much later in life so it's

10347.96 --> 10354.64
much better to feel 25 28 than it does

10350.54 --> 10354.640000000001
18. it really does

10355.46 --> 10360.979
are you sure I don't know you're not

10358.64 --> 10362.66
gonna find out turret

10360.979 --> 10365.619999999999
I

10362.66 --> 10365.619999999999
it's not a chick

10366.74 --> 10372.039999999999
if it was a woman she would have said so

10373.76 --> 10378.74
I mean clammy could for real clammy

10376.88 --> 10381.278999999999
could be like a freaking trans kit for

10378.74 --> 10381.279
all you know

10381.92 --> 10388.72
could be a castrated teenager

10385.819 --> 10388.72
I I don't know

10402.979 --> 10411.22
usually it's the outer way around what

10408.979 --> 10413.66
the other way around

10411.22 --> 10416.899
yeah talking about how bad their health

10413.66 --> 10418.819
yeah but that's because they

10416.899 --> 10422.539999999999
they

10418.819 --> 10425.66
rob their own health they over invested

10422.54 --> 10429.439
they like they they basically sacrifice

10425.66 --> 10431.779
their own well-being for their ambition

10429.439 --> 10433.52
got the wrong kind of job got the wrong

10431.779 --> 10434.960000000001
kind of picture of how things are

10433.52 --> 10436.1
durable

10434.96 --> 10438.319
wrong

10436.1 --> 10441.62
future prospects

10438.319 --> 10443.778999999999
and then they medical [ __ ] on top

10441.62 --> 10445.76
they take a couple of shots because the

10443.779 --> 10448.34
doctor recommended it or the television

10445.76 --> 10450.74
told the or the boss yeah and then you

10448.34 --> 10452.84
get older and you're like oh I feel all

10450.74 --> 10455.899
the [ __ ] up yeah that's because you

10452.84 --> 10459.26
[ __ ] yourself up you [ __ ] up bro

10455.899 --> 10461.899
girl you [ __ ] up and now you're [ __ ]

10459.26 --> 10463.64
up because you [ __ ] yourself up that's

10461.899 --> 10466.399
not normal

10463.64 --> 10469.099999999999
you don't feel old and feeble and sick

10466.399 --> 10470.119999999999
when you're in your late 30s you don't

10469.1 --> 10472.04
do that

10470.12 --> 10474.560000000001
that's not normal

10472.04 --> 10476.0
that only happens because you [ __ ]

10474.56 --> 10478.16
yourself up

10476.0 --> 10480.319
that took too many drugs ate too much

10478.16 --> 10482.899
unhealthy junk food

10480.319 --> 10484.699999999999
took too many unnecessary medical

10482.899 --> 10487.42
[ __ ]

10484.7 --> 10487.42
drugs

10487.7 --> 10493.04
got into the wrong things wasted too

10490.88 --> 10497.119999999999
much of your time

10493.04 --> 10498.740000000002
yeah you're sick and you're lost now and

10497.12 --> 10500.720000000001
you're getting old and you feel like

10498.74 --> 10504.88
it's all wasted

10500.72 --> 10504.88
because it is you did that to yourself

10516.439 --> 10523.58
oh you assumed that okay Terry well I I

10518.84 --> 10525.92
don't have such assumptions at the ready

10523.58 --> 10528.68
I purely just go by behavior and it just

10525.92 --> 10531.74
seemed like a gay guy like a young

10528.68 --> 10535.399
teenager kind of gayish guy that that's

10531.74 --> 10538.24
what it seems like and I don't care

10535.399 --> 10538.24
foreign

10540.34 --> 10545.899
come on turret

10543.8 --> 10548.778999999999
kind of Judge a character is that you

10545.899 --> 10551.358999999999
think that Brenda could even attempt to

10548.779 --> 10556.399000000001
emulate that level of humility

10551.359 --> 10560.359
no no she can't Brenda is not a good

10556.399 --> 10561.56
actor at all not very dynamic in her

10560.359 --> 10563.6
behavior

10561.56 --> 10565.1
you know that you should know that have

10563.6 --> 10570.08
you ever seen Brenda actually

10565.1 --> 10570.08
successfully act emotions no

10572.76 --> 10576.2
[Music]

10574.279 --> 10581.720000000001
I mean

10576.2 --> 10584.300000000001
she's like the average acting skill

10581.72 --> 10587.84
of like an old-fashioned farmer's

10584.3 --> 10591.5
daughter I mean there's no acting

10587.84 --> 10593.68
she Brenda not acting not good at it at

10591.5 --> 10593.68
all

10610.279 --> 10614.380000000001
could be Chad DVD no

10615.979 --> 10621.14
chat GPT is not passive aggressively

10618.979 --> 10624.019999999999
backstabbing under the

10621.14 --> 10626.119999999999
farce of being all friendly that's jet

10624.02 --> 10628.7
jpt does not do that

10626.12 --> 10632.240000000002
okay Street of gold

10628.7 --> 10634.359
you just dropped that notion yeah Chad

10632.24 --> 10638.439
GPT cannot like

10634.359 --> 10641.24
simulate complex like really complicated

10638.439 --> 10644.720000000001
multi-threaded social interaction

10641.24 --> 10645.46
subtleties yeah chat GPT does not do

10644.72 --> 10649.88
that

10645.46 --> 10651.679999999998
right it can barely get in factual

10649.88 --> 10654.74
informations correct

10651.68 --> 10655.64
it can barely even see logic in plain

10654.74 --> 10659.84
sight

10655.64 --> 10662.899
yeah don't expect chat GPT to roll out

10659.84 --> 10665.72
like really complicated multi-layered

10662.899 --> 10667.64
social Dynamic interaction okay this is

10665.72 --> 10670.88
not gonna happen

10667.64 --> 10673.699999999999
like that's gonna take decades before

10670.88 --> 10677.179999999998
any kind of AI

10673.7 --> 10679.640000000001
social interactions could even remotely

10677.18 --> 10680.34
get that refined

10679.64 --> 10683.24
okay

10680.34 --> 10686.42
[Music]

10683.24 --> 10689.66
what was the talk about today well just

10686.42 --> 10692.86
read the read the title

10689.66 --> 10692.86
[Music]

10703.7 --> 10708.740000000002
yeah we were talking we've been talking

10706.1 --> 10711.62
about a lot of different things today

10708.74 --> 10713.539999999999
but like the sub the subject that

10711.62 --> 10716.42
eventually spawned the title was about

10713.54 --> 10719.18
how the globe was trans I think that was

10716.42 --> 10722.779
Richard G that brought it up

10719.18 --> 10725.0
I said tear it I don't remember

10722.779 --> 10727.220000000001
so yeah that's why the title of the

10725.0 --> 10730.58
globe is stunning and brave like a trans

10727.22 --> 10732.619999999999
person you can't tell the globe that

10730.58 --> 10736.22
it's actually created and measured flat

10732.62 --> 10737.779
that's super big at it in a very hurtful

10736.22 --> 10740.179999999998
towards the globe they might end up

10737.779 --> 10742.6
killing themselves you can't say that if

10740.18 --> 10742.6
you say

10742.64 --> 10748.278999999999
in to the globe that they're measured

10745.16 --> 10750.26
flat and created then you might get

10748.279 --> 10752.439
fired from your job or kicked out of

10750.26 --> 10752.439
Twitter

10752.479 --> 10758.8

10764.84 --> 10770.14

10809.72 --> 10815.3
hours

10811.819 --> 10819.08
very unusual for a weekday show but I

10815.3 --> 10820.819
mean yeah if Nathan's just if his

10819.08 --> 10821.859
computer is going to break well then I'm

10820.819 --> 10826.96
just gonna

10821.859 --> 10826.960000000001
scoop up all that left over attention

10831.5 --> 10836.38
you were yeah you did mention yeah I got

10833.479 --> 10836.38
the got it right Richard

10836.779 --> 10841.7
you didn't know we made the title oh

10839.479 --> 10843.5
I thought I'd mentioned it a couple of

10841.7 --> 10845.779
times but yeah I did make the title

10843.5 --> 10847.58
because it's funny

10845.779 --> 10850.640000000001
it's a really good point yeah the the

10847.58 --> 10853.22
globe Earth is kind of trans it's a

10850.64 --> 10856.84
really smart point so that was very well

10853.22 --> 10856.84
spotted Richard G

10866.18 --> 10868.899
right

10878.5 --> 10881.819
[Music]

10883.22 --> 10886.84
where's the only video what

10887.779 --> 10890.68
okay

10895.52 --> 10900.02
the Brave and beautiful love yeah but

10898.76 --> 10903.979
that's

10900.02 --> 10907.279
but it's stunning and brave is very

10903.979 --> 10909.979
like it is a very specific way of saying

10907.279 --> 10913.66
it that you immediately associate like

10909.979 --> 10916.76
with the false virtuous addressal right

10913.66 --> 10918.979
stunning and brave immediately you know

10916.76 --> 10922.42
that

10918.979 --> 10922.42
what what that means right

10922.46 --> 10926.72
so I would just say when you hear the

10924.14 --> 10929.42
phraseology stunning and brave you know

10926.72 --> 10932.0
somebody's gonna be like really lifted

10929.42 --> 10936.319
up socially emotionally

10932.0 --> 10938.24
for something that's not real

10936.319 --> 10941.38
every time

10938.24 --> 10941.38
every time

10945.02 --> 10950.319000000001
send you 20 years thanks man thanks dag

10947.779 --> 10950.319000000001
that's awesome

10950.779 --> 10954.74
I will get a joint for that

10952.819 --> 10957.08
definitely

10954.74 --> 10959.6
I'm still stocked up on food for for a

10957.08 --> 10963.8
bit so yeah that's very welcome thank

10959.6 --> 10966.02
you for the support keeps me going

10963.8 --> 10969.58
keeps the early bird

10966.02 --> 10969.58
show going

10972.859 --> 10976.18
goodbye clammy

10976.7 --> 10979.240000000002
hmm

10981.439 --> 10987.380000000001
okay that's an interesting point

10984.38 --> 10987.38
unfortunately

10987.979 --> 10992.84
there's literally the title is now a

10990.979 --> 10996.08
hundred characters which is the absolute

10992.84 --> 10997.22
Max I can't add in another space or or a

10996.08 --> 10999.859
DOT

10997.22 --> 11002.679999999998
so the title is completely full

10999.859 --> 11006.58
and I don't want to like

11002.68 --> 11009.34
crunch it even smaller

11006.58 --> 11012.16
because then the cohesion of the actual

11009.34 --> 11013.359
title will diminish so I'm afraid I'm

11012.16 --> 11017.399
not gonna

11013.359 --> 11017.399000000001
do goodbye clammy in there

11021.399 --> 11026.199999999999
and besides

11023.38 --> 11027.699999999999
people might be thinking that clammy

11026.2 --> 11029.319000000001
died or something I don't want to do

11027.7 --> 11032.140000000001
that

11029.319 --> 11034.38
but thank you for thinking with me about

11032.14 --> 11034.38
it

11037.359 --> 11042.7
good I'm not gonna you actually write

11040.479 --> 11044.858999999999
down the word [ __ ] in the chat there

11042.7 --> 11048.34
that's that I think that would actually

11044.859 --> 11051.34
get me a strike if I did that

11048.34 --> 11054.06
unless I was literally talking about the

11051.34 --> 11054.06
musical instrument

11060.72 --> 11064.199999999999
Animal Farm

11071.14 --> 11074.699999999999
you get blood from yeah no they don't

11073.18 --> 11077.08
like it in a chat

11074.7 --> 11081.16
unfortunately though I can still just

11077.08 --> 11083.68
say [ __ ] or [ __ ] or gay on YouTube

11081.16 --> 11085.779
apparently YouTube is okay maybe it is

11083.68 --> 11087.76
because I am officially noted in their

11085.779 --> 11090.279
book as being secretly gay so I'm

11087.76 --> 11092.380000000001
allowed to do it

11090.279 --> 11094.84
whatever man

11092.38 --> 11097.539999999999
if that is your conclusion and that

11094.84 --> 11100.0
keeps me able to keep doing that on my

11097.54 --> 11103.240000000002
channel I'm all good with it

11100.0 --> 11106.0
I'm not gonna stop saying that anyway

11103.24 --> 11108.64
I am clinically homophobic and that's

11106.0 --> 11110.68
not a joke

11108.64 --> 11115.42
it's pretty much in actual condition

11110.68 --> 11117.939
that's born from psychological situation

11115.42 --> 11122.02
and I can't get rid of it

11117.939 --> 11124.12
and I'm always trying to deal with it

11122.02 --> 11127.060000000001
so that I can keep it under control not

11124.12 --> 11129.399000000001
get super sick from getting continually

11127.06 --> 11130.899
confronted with gay people behaving

11129.399 --> 11133.119999999999
gayly

11130.899 --> 11134.92
like when my [ __ ] roommate decides

11133.12 --> 11139.0
that he's just gonna make out with his

11134.92 --> 11141.279
boyfriend with his [ __ ] door open

11139.0 --> 11144.1
I actually had to tell them like dude

11141.279 --> 11146.34
when you do that you [ __ ] close the

11144.1 --> 11146.34
door

11146.56 --> 11151.359
I hope he's gonna do that from now on

11148.479 --> 11154.119999999999
right I have to deal with my homophobia

11151.359 --> 11158.02
continually it's really annoying because

11154.12 --> 11160.060000000001
I can't just ignore it every time I bump

11158.02 --> 11162.460000000001
into that I see that even for like a

11160.06 --> 11164.26
quarter of a second it makes me almost

11162.46 --> 11167.38
throw up

11164.26 --> 11170.02
yeah it's an actual Condition it's not a

11167.38 --> 11173.8
joke it's not an act to be all popular

11170.02 --> 11176.979000000001
no it's literally a condition that I try

11173.8 --> 11179.14
to overcome okay in my I try to overcome

11176.979 --> 11181.899
it by literally numbing it out and just

11179.14 --> 11183.64
being among gay people and not having a

11181.899 --> 11186.519999999999
response to it

11183.64 --> 11189.099999999999
and that seemed to sort of work when I

11186.52 --> 11191.439
was younger Now That I'm Older that

11189.1 --> 11195.52
doesn't work anymore

11191.439 --> 11197.92
and now I can only just be what I am in

11195.52 --> 11200.859
the face of it and try to deal with it

11197.92 --> 11204.22
and try to not make me not make it me

11200.859 --> 11206.439
and not it make it have me ah not have

11204.22 --> 11209.76
it make me sick

11206.439 --> 11209.76
that's the objective

11216.819 --> 11220.38
slap dude he lives here

11222.16 --> 11224.58
yeah

11224.74 --> 11232.119999999999
you can't just do that

11227.56 --> 11235.66
but if he's gonna be officially indecent

11232.12 --> 11238.779
then I can eventually reprimand him for

11235.66 --> 11241.0
it I can do something about it

11238.779 --> 11243.16
even if there is no Sharia law I can

11241.0 --> 11246.34
still do something about it because

11243.16 --> 11248.38
you're like

11246.34 --> 11250.359
like doing sex

11248.38 --> 11254.399
in front of somebody else and they're

11250.359 --> 11254.399000000001
not approving is illegal

11255.399 --> 11259.38
that is technically illegal

11260.92 --> 11266.859
now if you do it in public outside of

11263.439 --> 11269.56
home that's really illegal that's like a

11266.859 --> 11271.66
rest worthy illegal really

11269.56 --> 11272.92
can't have sex or something in public

11271.66 --> 11275.68
like that

11272.92 --> 11277.6
but if somebody's like clearly bothered

11275.68 --> 11281.02
by it

11277.6 --> 11283.66
that is prosecutable

11281.02 --> 11286.140000000001
if they ignore requests to keep it more

11283.66 --> 11286.14
private

11287.92 --> 11292.54
would you feel guilty in being called I

11290.38 --> 11296.08
don't feel guilty

11292.54 --> 11299.439
I thought it was it's super offensive

11296.08 --> 11301.06
that that they use homophobic as a slur

11299.439 --> 11304.66
out there

11301.06 --> 11307.18
to shame people yeah I am homophobic

11304.66 --> 11308.68
there's nothing I can do about it it's

11307.18 --> 11312.54
real

11308.68 --> 11312.54
but it's not bad either

11312.58 --> 11318.88
yeah you can't get rid of it

11316.12 --> 11322.720000000001
but who says it's bad I think that it's

11318.88 --> 11323.979
actually God's voice

11322.72 --> 11327.16
it's

11323.979 --> 11329.34
closeness to God that makes it hurt so

11327.16 --> 11329.34
much

11333.76 --> 11337.12
it's because I'm not disconnected with

11336.04 --> 11340.479000000001
God

11337.12 --> 11342.819000000001
that I'm not okay with it

11340.479 --> 11346.5
genuine that's really what I think it is

11342.819 --> 11346.5
it's what it feels like

11350.68 --> 11356.2
right and when I like escape a gay

11353.62 --> 11358.479000000001
scenario or whatever like uh gross

11356.2 --> 11360.460000000001
people making out all of a sudden

11358.479 --> 11361.24
didn't expect it and then I get out of

11360.46 --> 11363.64
there

11361.24 --> 11366.1
well when I then get out of that

11363.64 --> 11369.46
situation I don't feel like oh what is

11366.1 --> 11372.279
me no no I feel like oh relieved I

11369.46 --> 11375.16
actually got away from that I'm happy

11372.279 --> 11378.52
again not in the presence of disgusting

11375.16 --> 11381.58
Asian yeah that's how I feel I'm not

11378.52 --> 11383.380000000001
gonna be like oh no it's gay again I

11381.58 --> 11385.18
always follow me around no no I'm like

11383.38 --> 11388.3
oh thank God

11385.18 --> 11390.279
I I can't just get away from it I'm so

11388.3 --> 11391.66
happy not to be in the presence of gay

11390.279 --> 11394.54
people now

11391.66 --> 11396.34
that's my response

11394.54 --> 11399.6
yeah

11396.34 --> 11399.6
is that hateful

11401.319 --> 11408.819
or is it literally a physical

11404.7 --> 11410.2
physiological condition like improvably

11408.819 --> 11412.778999999999
physical

11410.2 --> 11417.240000000002
that I'm trying to deal with the best

11412.779 --> 11417.24
way the most civilized way I can

11417.46 --> 11423.699999999999
but not suppressing it expressing it

11421.0 --> 11426.64
ensuring that it doesn't lead to harm to

11423.7 --> 11428.92
myself or others yeah but it's there

11426.64 --> 11432.24
it's [ __ ] there

11428.92 --> 11432.24
and it's not gonna go away

11434.38 --> 11440.199999999999
it implies fear yeah

11437.86 --> 11442.84
[Music]

11440.2 --> 11445.6
but it is in a way

11442.84 --> 11448.960000000001
it's not anti because that would be you

11445.6 --> 11451.06
want to destroy it it just makes me sick

11448.96 --> 11454.358999999999
is that phobia

11451.06 --> 11457.14
it's not like I hate it it makes me sick

11454.359 --> 11460.359
no it's like

11457.14 --> 11463.06
like it literally makes me sick

11460.359 --> 11464.939
is that phobia is that hate

11463.06 --> 11468.76
I don't know I'm just calling it because

11464.939 --> 11471.220000000001
it's the homosexuality and the way of

11468.76 --> 11474.279
that being that literally triggers the

11471.22 --> 11477.58
effect whether it's a phobia or whatever

11474.279 --> 11480.880000000001
it does it's kind of secondary

11477.58 --> 11483.88
it's just a physical response I have it

11480.88 --> 11486.819
I call it homophobia and when I do

11483.88 --> 11489.16
people do understand it

11486.819 --> 11490.66
when I say that I don't think I'm the

11489.16 --> 11493.359
only one I think a whole bunch of people

11490.66 --> 11496.539999999999
have it allergy

11493.359 --> 11499.0
yeah but it's spiritual though it's not

11496.54 --> 11501.52
it's not like literally an allergic or

11499.0 --> 11504.66
physical reaction

11501.52 --> 11504.66
Stevie Traveler

11513.76 --> 11519.16
by the way there's people out there I've

11515.8 --> 11521.858999999999
met people way way time ago that were

11519.16 --> 11524.56
worse than me in that that word

11521.859 --> 11527.5
not just have it with homosexuals but

11524.56 --> 11531.16
would have it with any yeah

11527.5 --> 11532.66
did you know that weird right

11531.16 --> 11534.64
I don't know if they're still around but

11532.66 --> 11537.52
there were people that literally if they

11534.64 --> 11539.199999999999
saw people making out even like a man

11537.52 --> 11541.359
and a woman even when they're pretty

11539.2 --> 11545.380000000001
even when they do it subtly and not

11541.359 --> 11548.58
really excessively gross that they would

11545.38 --> 11552.699999999999
and not with gays and with with

11548.58 --> 11554.319
heterosexual couples really weird

11552.7 --> 11556.54
so

11554.319 --> 11560.979
it is a condition that's not just bound

11556.54 --> 11564.1
to response to gays like that it's weird

11560.979 --> 11566.679999999998
but I am very sympathetic to that it's

11564.1 --> 11569.7
almost like a blessing I'd say Another

11566.68 --> 11573.52
Blessing of God like you are prohibited

11569.7 --> 11575.380000000001
to indulging or enjoying that that level

11573.52 --> 11578.800000000001
of sin

11575.38 --> 11582.179999999998
that's cool that's could be considered

11578.8 --> 11582.179999999998
as good to have that

11584.08 --> 11586.319
right

11586.42 --> 11592.12
anyway

11588.939 --> 11593.19
okay over three hours ten minutes I

11592.12 --> 11595.300000000001
think I'm gonna round out

11593.19 --> 11597.84
