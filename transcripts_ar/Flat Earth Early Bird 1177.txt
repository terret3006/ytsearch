quite beautiful

95.04 --> 100.799
been really a couple of nice days

98.24 --> 103.19999999999999
this last week

100.799 --> 106.07900000000001
it's less windy i've been out for

103.2 --> 108.0
groceries before this

106.079 --> 110.96
because i did manage to get up

108.0 --> 113.52
decent at a decent time

110.96 --> 116.32
it's like really nice outside but still

113.52 --> 116.32
cold though

117.52 --> 121.84
like i'm still like wearing gloves in

119.92 --> 124.07900000000001
the scarf

121.84 --> 128.0
because it's still kind of cold

124.079 --> 128.959
despite that nice sun

128.0 --> 129.92
all right

128.959 --> 132.8
the

129.92 --> 135.04
sun is bright and beautiful

132.8 --> 137.28
there's a couple of fluffy clouds up

135.04 --> 137.28
there

138.48 --> 143.84
some airplanes but they're not really

140.4 --> 143.84
leaving any trails

146.8 --> 152.72
overall

148.959 --> 152.72
a very nice and beautiful day

154.4 --> 159.36
hello kevlar first in chat good to see

157.2 --> 159.35999999999999
you

159.599 --> 165.79999999999998
it is monday the 7th of march 2022.

171.2 --> 175.28
so how has your weekend been

176.72 --> 179.84
mine was pretty good

179.92 --> 185.35999999999999
did anybody watch the insidious movies

183.76 --> 189.04
i did

185.36 --> 189.04000000000002
i watched three of them actually

190.239 --> 193.36
and it was interesting

193.84 --> 198.64000000000001
right there were a couple of more jump

196.08 --> 200.959
scares in the first movie than i thought

198.64 --> 204.319
it's basically

200.959 --> 206.08
there was some guy i just kept on like

204.319 --> 207.76
being

206.08 --> 209.84
on a piano

207.76 --> 213.519
just kept going ballistic with that

209.84 --> 217.28
piano and yeah it's pretty scary

213.519 --> 220.0
still overall pretty

217.28 --> 221.92
good jump scares like

220.0 --> 224.319
yeah it's almost tough to say that right

221.92 --> 227.2
but it's not annoying it's like you're

224.319 --> 228.879
expecting that and it's it does give a

227.2 --> 230.72
payoff

228.879 --> 232.239
although especially in the first movie

230.72 --> 234.0
there were a couple of times when it's

232.239 --> 235.92000000000002
like okay could you just leave the damn

234.0 --> 237.68
piano alone

235.92 --> 240.64
where it like if it would have been a

237.68 --> 244.0
silent scene and not just like bang

240.64 --> 245.27999999999997
as soon as you see the ghost apparition

244.0 --> 248.159
like a couple of times they could have

245.28 --> 248.159
just left it out

248.239 --> 255.12
and it would probably be even better

250.879 --> 256.639
but like the follow-up movies

255.12 --> 260.0
like were

256.639 --> 262.079
definitely they they tinkered on it

260.0 --> 265.28
and

262.079 --> 268.24
became less jump scary

265.28 --> 270.71999999999997
and yeah then i basically saw the entire

268.24 --> 272.479
thing and it's so impressive like it's

270.72 --> 274.16
like the second movie especially it's

272.479 --> 277.919
like it's almost better than the first

274.16 --> 279.52000000000004
one but it is like part of the first one

277.919 --> 282.15999999999997
if you don't see the second one the

279.52 --> 284.08
first one almost doesn't really make all

282.16 --> 286.639
that much sense and you almost get the

284.08 --> 288.32
feeling like wow that's

286.639 --> 290.88
rushed or something

288.32 --> 293.36
with some scenes but yeah if you see the

290.88 --> 294.96
second movie then you realize no no it

293.36 --> 296.639
wasn't

294.96 --> 300.479
pretty epic

296.639 --> 304.32
and the third one is like a prequel

300.479 --> 304.32
and it's also awesome

304.8 --> 310.40000000000003
all right i haven't seen the fourth one

306.16 --> 313.759
yet didn't get to watch all of them

310.4 --> 317.59999999999997
but yeah it was pretty much

313.759 --> 317.6
or almost as good as i remembered

321.039 --> 323.44
anyway

322.16 --> 326.639
don't know if you guys have watched it

323.44 --> 326.639
hey jeff gas head

335.44 --> 341.6
going to watch it on wednesday

339.28 --> 341.59999999999997
right

344.96 --> 348.32
all right well it's okay

349.52 --> 353.35999999999996
just

350.96 --> 355.68
one tip though you know don't

353.36 --> 357.039
don't watch especially don't watch the

355.68 --> 358.72
first movie

357.039 --> 361.12
like right before you're planning to go

358.72 --> 361.12
to bed

361.68 --> 366.479
like if you watch it early like i ended

364.0 --> 369.28
with the third movie and it's a lot more

366.479 --> 369.28
digestible

369.44 --> 373.36
for when you go to sleep but the first

371.039 --> 375.68
one is like it gives you really [ __ ]

373.36 --> 377.44
up jump moments and like i even noticed

375.68 --> 378.40000000000003
like oh i'm going to the toilet now and

377.44 --> 382.479
it's like

378.4 --> 384.79999999999995
it's dark i'm not scared of the darkness

382.479 --> 387.84
but the movie has kind of temporarily

384.8 --> 390.319
made me scared of the darkness

387.84 --> 392.56
because it is really scary that first

390.319 --> 392.56
one

392.639 --> 396.96000000000004
all right

395.36 --> 398.96000000000004
so yeah don't watch it right before

396.96 --> 401.59999999999997
going to bed and

398.96 --> 403.84
don't if don't watch it if you're with

401.6 --> 406.84000000000003
your kids or something don't do that to

403.84 --> 406.84
them

409.12 --> 411.44
all right

412.16 --> 417.8
hey wrath

414.319 --> 417.8
borders boy

422.08 --> 424.4
hmm

425.919 --> 431.75899999999996
i finally had a phone call with my

427.919 --> 431.75899999999996
healer also before the show

432.08 --> 434.71999999999997
really needed

434.84 --> 439.75899999999996
that put a couple of things in

437.12 --> 439.759
perspective

439.919 --> 444.15999999999997
freaking dark world visions basically

442.08 --> 448.75899999999996
haunting me

444.16 --> 448.759
i had to just cross reference again

450.08 --> 454.15999999999997
basically like

451.84 --> 457.75899999999996
to help him remind me

454.16 --> 459.84000000000003
like yeah it's really not real

457.759 --> 462.0
it didn't physically happen

459.84 --> 463.28
even though it's like super suggestible

462.0 --> 467.039
to you

463.28 --> 467.039
and yeah it is that's what it is

475.039 --> 481.28
right basically confirming like yes that

478.08 --> 483.35999999999996
it was placed there by almost arima

481.28 --> 487.28
almost the personification and it's

483.36 --> 489.36
there to lure you into madness

487.28 --> 490.87899999999996
and terror

489.36 --> 493.13
like that's

490.879 --> 494.8
what it was placed there for

493.13 --> 497.759
[Music]

494.8 --> 500.56
but if i just keep

497.759 --> 500.56
a focus

501.199 --> 505.28000000000003
and just like try to not let it distract

503.919 --> 509.12
me

505.28 --> 509.11999999999995
then everything should be all right

512.64 --> 517.279
anyway

514.159 --> 518.399
i'm doing pretty good right now

517.279 --> 522.08
had a

518.399 --> 522.08
castle before this

524.959 --> 529.04
ah because i was really hungry this

526.72 --> 529.0400000000001
morning

531.2 --> 534.2

like that's not gonna work out woke is

573.279 --> 577.8389999999999

642.959 --> 646.56
of just watching

644.48 --> 647.6800000000001
the insidious movies there wasn't really

646.56 --> 650.68
much on

647.68 --> 650.68

that i missed out on

728.32 --> 733.32
let's just start flicking through the

730.32 --> 733.32
news

774.639 --> 777.639
hello

791.04 --> 795.5999999999999
anyone here hear of john

794.24 --> 798.48
levi

795.6 --> 798.48

798.839 --> 802.8000000000001
maybe hey kind of bear

810.32 --> 813.8000000000001
a gm west

821.44 --> 824.44
um

848.32 --> 851.32
so

857.6 --> 862.639
right so yeah

859.44 --> 862.639
i don't really have anything

863.199 --> 868.24
sitting there

864.56 --> 868.2399999999999
ready to be explained or anything

868.72 --> 872.9590000000001
what's the latest from the netherlands

870.639 --> 872.9590000000001
ah

875.199 --> 878.519
let's see

887.279 --> 891.519
it's a lot of focus on ukraine and

893.92 --> 898.12
yeah which is to be expected

899.199 --> 903.04
but there seem to be plenty of people

903.36 --> 907.92
that are basically

905.199 --> 910.88
yeah taking on

907.92 --> 913.8389999999999
similar to my position saying like yeah

910.88 --> 916.16
like russia isn't really

913.839 --> 918.8800000000001
completely stepping out of line they

916.16 --> 921.199
have their reasons

918.88 --> 922.8
and there's a lot of deception going on

921.199 --> 924.4799999999999
and

922.8 --> 926.959
in the media

924.48 --> 929.44
which is already proven

926.959 --> 931.4399999999999
so yeah that's kind of what seems to be

929.44 --> 934.44
happening in media world here in the

931.44 --> 934.44
netherlands

946.639 --> 951.639
renaming chicken key as what

985.759 --> 990.48
any bands on vodka in the super i don't

988.88 --> 992.72
know

990.48 --> 995.72
supermarket that i go to doesn't sell

992.72 --> 995.72
vodka

1008.639 --> 1014.88
all right i overall like i'm very glad

1012.24 --> 1017.839
that they're just like my supermarket is

1014.88 --> 1020.16
like not getting involved to that good

1017.839 --> 1024.319
stay out of that [ __ ]

1020.16 --> 1027.6
right don't get political

1024.319 --> 1027.6
political's bad

1031.919 --> 1035.439
by the way i did see like

1035.6 --> 1040.1599999999999
this is a few days ago there was

1038.64 --> 1042.72
not yesterday

1040.16 --> 1046.959
i think it was saturday or something

1042.72 --> 1049.28
like the the church there had like this

1046.959 --> 1049.28
uh

1049.84 --> 1053.76
this drawing board

1051.84 --> 1056.08
outside

1053.76 --> 1058.559
saying like oh we're collecting for

1056.08 --> 1060.6399999999999
ukraine

1058.559 --> 1063.36
really

1060.64 --> 1063.3600000000001
but yeah

1063.44 --> 1068.0800000000002
i mean seriously that church is turning

1065.679 --> 1071.039
out to be such a [ __ ] church

1068.08 --> 1075.039
like really bad

1071.039 --> 1079.12
really really bad like everything bad

1075.039 --> 1082.799
all they were globe teaching

1079.12 --> 1085.6
during bible study which is ridiculous

1082.799 --> 1087.679
they were totally pro corona measures

1085.6 --> 1088.48
with everything they basically closed

1087.679 --> 1091.039
down

1088.48 --> 1093.52
most of the time because of that [ __ ]

1091.039 --> 1096.08
and now they're on the ukraine side of

1093.52 --> 1099.6
course they're so

1096.08 --> 1099.6
so cocked it's terrible

1100.559 --> 1103.559
ugh

1115.76 --> 1122.0
i missed the tail end of that

1118.96 --> 1125.44
no you must have misheard me my mic is

1122.0 --> 1125.44
working alright isn't it

1130.16 --> 1133.52
it's just that the media is constantly

1132.16 --> 1135.52
suggesting

1133.52 --> 1138.08
that russia has stepped out of line with

1135.52 --> 1142.559
his actions and it's

1138.08 --> 1142.559
basically starting a war and but yeah

1144.16 --> 1147.76
that's the mainstream media and there's

1146.0 --> 1148.559
plenty of people in the netherlands that

1147.76 --> 1150.16
are

1148.559 --> 1154.12
seeing through that and they're speaking

1150.16 --> 1154.1200000000001
out against it

1177.52 --> 1179.84
okay

1198.0 --> 1200.32
ah

1200.72 --> 1206.6000000000001
damn it that was something else when i

1202.559 --> 1206.6
forgot what i was gonna say

1224.72 --> 1229.44
yeah borders boy yeah that's the problem

1227.12 --> 1229.4399999999998
right

1233.679 --> 1239.76
like

1234.88 --> 1239.7600000000002
they have extremely dirty war tactics

1240.08 --> 1245.799
that's why

1242.0 --> 1245.799
it's always problematic

1260.4 --> 1265.2
when they start no no borders boy no

1262.64 --> 1265.2
they won't

1265.36 --> 1269.3999999999999
they literally won't

1280.4 --> 1285.679
right because it will just be made into

1282.72 --> 1288.08
oh they made it up it's all like

1285.679 --> 1291.679
the propaganda and lie level

1288.08 --> 1294.48
that media is allowing to uniformly pick

1291.679 --> 1296.88
up is so

1294.48 --> 1298.88
so delusional that they'll just deny

1296.88 --> 1300.72
things if it's inconvenient and like

1298.88 --> 1303.5200000000002
really stick to that

1300.72 --> 1305.52
let's just say no that's fake news

1303.52 --> 1306.6399999999999
from russia it's not actually happening

1305.52 --> 1308.0
even though

1306.64 --> 1309.2
they all know

1308.0 --> 1313.72
or people that have actually

1309.2 --> 1313.72
investigated no it's really happening

1321.679 --> 1325.6000000000001
they'll probably even claim it's the

1323.52 --> 1327.84
opposite that the russians are doing

1325.6 --> 1330.559
that with the ukrainians really they'll

1327.84 --> 1330.559
just say that

1330.96 --> 1335.4
i mean it's it's very predictable

1352.48 --> 1357.6
china siding with ukraine that's not a

1355.2 --> 1357.6000000000001
chance

1358.0 --> 1361.84
there's no way they're going to do that

1371.679 --> 1376.4
like why why would they want to do that

1382.799 --> 1387.84
i mean russia and

1385.44 --> 1391.8400000000001
china's partnership is kind of what's

1387.84 --> 1394.0
keeping them afloat right now

1391.84 --> 1397.6
against the beast against the entire

1394.0 --> 1397.6
west globalist system

1399.36 --> 1404.08
of which by the way china is very

1401.6 --> 1408.6
integrated with that but it's still

1404.08 --> 1408.6
their own they're still their own party

1434.799 --> 1440.24
right i had to have some

1437.039 --> 1441.279
weird signs though

1440.24 --> 1444.32
that

1441.279 --> 1445.76
there might like

1444.32 --> 1448.08
turkey

1445.76 --> 1450.24
might suddenly

1448.08 --> 1452.6399999999999
throw a ranch in the works for russia

1450.24 --> 1454.799
that's something that i've

1452.64 --> 1456.4
i got this hint somewhere it was very

1454.799 --> 1457.36
short but

1456.4 --> 1458.5590000000002
it's

1457.36 --> 1461.799
difficult

1458.559 --> 1461.799
to explain

1475.6 --> 1483.559
so yeah pay attention uh on that

1479.6 --> 1483.559
what turkey's gonna do

1490.48 --> 1494.32
turkey making me hungry no

1498.84 --> 1502.9189999999999
um uh

1524.72 --> 1530.88
yeah that's correct borders boy

1528.64 --> 1530.88
so

1542.64 --> 1547.5200000000002
i think that

1544.64 --> 1549.8400000000001
on the in the grand scheme of things

1547.52 --> 1552.08
it's more important for russia to make

1549.84 --> 1554.3999999999999
sure that this just

1552.08 --> 1556.8799999999999
that they finish up what they were going

1554.4 --> 1558.88
to do as quickly as possible

1556.88 --> 1560.48
right the longer this lasts the more

1558.88 --> 1561.7600000000002
it's going to cost it's going to cost

1560.48 --> 1564.08
morale

1561.76 --> 1566.32
it's going to cost lives going to cost

1564.08 --> 1570.799
money

1566.32 --> 1572.72
going to cost political score basically

1570.799 --> 1575.72
so

1572.72 --> 1575.72
yeah

1597.919 --> 1602.0800000000002
yeah borders boy maybe

1600.88 --> 1604.7990000000002
or

1602.08 --> 1604.799
the opposite

1605.52 --> 1612.799
they might also actually try to exploit

1608.88 --> 1614.88
the situation that's like i'm not saying

1612.799 --> 1616.8799999999999
necessarily like oh they're just switch

1614.88 --> 1620.5590000000002
sides like yeah sure they could switch

1616.88 --> 1622.159
sides they kind of tend to do that

1620.559 --> 1624.559
and be a little unpredictable

1622.159 --> 1626.5590000000002
politically

1624.559 --> 1629.2
but they might also

1626.559 --> 1631.44
kind of like

1629.2 --> 1633.8400000000001
actually well do the opposite of what

1631.44 --> 1633.8400000000001
you said

1633.919 --> 1639.679
and like really root try to ruin things

1636.799 --> 1642.8799999999999
for russia on a tactical level and that

1639.679 --> 1645.1200000000001
is something that's gonna like really

1642.88 --> 1648.7600000000002
set bad blood

1645.12 --> 1648.76
if that would happen

1654.279 --> 1659.799
equatorial guinea

1656.399 --> 1659.799
support okay

1671.679 --> 1677.76
no cannabear that's that's insane

1676.0 --> 1680.76
why the hell would anybody want to do

1677.76 --> 1680.76
that

1689.039 --> 1692.08
i mean why

1694.399 --> 1700.0
right yeah war

1697.039 --> 1702.799
war is war

1700.0 --> 1704.799
because of what you want to take right

1702.799 --> 1707.9189999999999
this is not

1704.799 --> 1710.72
an era where basically kings

1707.919 --> 1712.24
will just have official wars that are

1710.72 --> 1714.88
like

1712.24 --> 1717.279
yeah pre-signed ahead how how it's going

1714.88 --> 1719.44
to play out like a game

1717.279 --> 1721.919
a strategic game right

1719.44 --> 1724.64
if that were the case yeah then i guess

1721.919 --> 1727.279
nations could set that up in antarctica

1724.64 --> 1729.44
although it's just like very very

1727.279 --> 1733.52
inconvenient

1729.44 --> 1733.52
and that's not really why war happens

1734.32 --> 1738.48
like what are you gonna yeah it's about

1736.559 --> 1740.6399999999999
taking land and securing land that's

1738.48 --> 1744.88
what it's about so why would you go to

1740.64 --> 1746.0800000000002
antarctica see it doesn't make any sense

1744.88 --> 1749.88
that's not

1746.08 --> 1749.8799999999999
how this age works

1756.559 --> 1761.96
oh you're being satirical

1758.96 --> 1761.96
okay

1770.399 --> 1773.399
so

1775.72 --> 1779.44
[Music]

1797.36 --> 1801.9189999999999
there was some guy going around

1799.12 --> 1804.6399999999999
washington really

1801.919 --> 1804.64
was he like

1804.88 --> 1808.88
from the ron paul

1806.88 --> 1811.679
faction

1808.88 --> 1811.679
i remember that

1811.76 --> 1816.24
this typical thing that ron paul used to

1813.76 --> 1816.24
say a lot

1820.799 --> 1827.12
that politicians if they vote for war

1824.24 --> 1830.6
that they should sign up their own kids

1827.12 --> 1830.6
within the military

1838.0 --> 1843.6
isn't there a peace treaty not really a

1840.559 --> 1846.1589999999999
peace treaty it's just a world treaty

1843.6 --> 1846.1589999999999
cana bear

1846.72 --> 1852.159
it's not conditional based on war

1850.64 --> 1855.72
it's just a

1852.159 --> 1855.72
general treaty

1897.679 --> 1901.519
what made me first realize the earth was

1899.919 --> 1903.2
flat

1901.519 --> 1907.0
uh

1903.2 --> 1907.0
people telling me

1912.24 --> 1917.84
although yeah like

1915.519 --> 1919.679
i still remember that as like i have

1917.84 --> 1922.0
vivid memories still as a kid when i

1919.679 --> 1924.0
went to one school i didn't i didn't

1922.0 --> 1926.24
stay there very long

1924.0 --> 1927.76
where they literally showed me

1926.24 --> 1928.88
a picture

1927.76 --> 1930.96
like a

1928.88 --> 1933.679
painted picture of

1930.96 --> 1935.44
a flat earth model

1933.679 --> 1937.679
and i still remember that i was like

1935.44 --> 1939.679
really like whoa what's that

1937.679 --> 1942.0800000000002
and then the teacher like really got

1939.679 --> 1944.72
really pissed off with me

1942.08 --> 1946.8799999999999
started calling me stupid just because i

1944.72 --> 1948.3990000000001
wanted to know more about the flat earth

1946.88 --> 1951.1200000000001
model

1948.399 --> 1952.9599999999998
like i didn't it just had artistic

1951.12 --> 1954.1589999999999
interest it was like that's really

1952.96 --> 1956.24
beautiful

1954.159 --> 1958.24
that's fascinating that's fantastical i

1956.24 --> 1962.36
wanted like

1958.24 --> 1962.36
want to know more about that

1962.64 --> 1967.6000000000001
and then i got like punished for it

1965.039 --> 1969.84
basically publicly shamed but i was in

1967.6 --> 1972.399
such a kick over it

1969.84 --> 1974.0
as a little kid that it didn't really do

1972.399 --> 1976.6399999999999
too much to me

1974.0 --> 1978.96
it was more that like the teacher was so

1976.64 --> 1980.96
angry that was more shocking that they

1978.96 --> 1983.919
were so angry not that i was being

1980.96 --> 1985.6000000000001
publicly shamed i didn't give a [ __ ]

1983.919 --> 1987.919
i was just like wow that's so

1985.6 --> 1992.32
interesting i didn't care that nobody

1987.919 --> 1992.3200000000002
wasn't interested i was interested

1992.799 --> 1995.039
right

1997.279 --> 2001.679
but when the the first time that i

1999.44 --> 2002.8400000000001
really realized like the earth is

2001.679 --> 2006.799
actually

2002.84 --> 2009.6
flat it's really tough to tell for sure

2006.799 --> 2009.6
when that was

2011.279 --> 2016.88
because i've been confronted with it

2014.559 --> 2018.6399999999999
going with the story and then kind of

2016.88 --> 2021.2
forgetting it right so it's never really

2018.64 --> 2023.279
like bang real

2021.2 --> 2025.8400000000001
that it really hit me that was much

2023.279 --> 2028.0
later like the only time it things

2025.84 --> 2029.84
really hit me slapped me in the face

2028.0 --> 2032.84
with it to really wake me up was in

2029.84 --> 2032.84
2015.

2033.36 --> 2038.399
all the times before that it i just kind

2035.679 --> 2040.96
of saw it as like

2038.399 --> 2040.9599999999998
a game

2041.36 --> 2045.4399999999998
like something that existed it was just

2043.279 --> 2047.84
very interesting

2045.44 --> 2051.119
i never really let it sink through that

2047.84 --> 2052.3199999999997
like yeah that is absolutely real also

2051.119 --> 2053.9190000000003
because

2052.32 --> 2056.48
every time i

2053.919 --> 2058.48
talked about it with anybody

2056.48 --> 2060.48
they never really knew all that much

2058.48 --> 2061.44
about it

2060.48 --> 2065.44
right

2061.44 --> 2067.52
that was like a major issue every time

2065.44 --> 2070.7200000000003
so like

2067.52 --> 2073.919
the flat earth felt more like a work in

2070.72 --> 2076.0
progress than the globe earth did to me

2073.919 --> 2077.919
even though the globe earth technically

2076.0 --> 2079.76
already figured out technically that it

2077.919 --> 2083.04
was a work in progress

2079.76 --> 2085.599
it's just so much more

2083.04 --> 2087.52
work has been done on it

2085.599 --> 2091.2000000000003
and that's why it's just more

2087.52 --> 2094.079
it felt more reliable

2091.2 --> 2094.0789999999997
throughout my life

2098.8 --> 2104.1600000000003
but i learned different little details

2101.2 --> 2104.96
from different people

2104.16 --> 2106.64
like

2104.96 --> 2109.599
still remember that there's one

2106.64 --> 2112.56
individual who shall not be mentioned

2109.599 --> 2114.7200000000003
certain time frame

2112.56 --> 2118.32
that basically really

2114.72 --> 2120.0
taught me about moonlight being cold

2118.32 --> 2121.119
and then when i learned about that i

2120.0 --> 2124.32
even like

2121.119 --> 2124.32
told it to my parents

2125.2 --> 2130.0789999999997
and they were like huh

2126.88 --> 2131.599
that's interesting

2130.079 --> 2133.44
could be

2131.599 --> 2136.44
it does feel cold

2133.44 --> 2136.44
right

2149.92 --> 2154.92
hey lenox that flat fellow

2163.68 --> 2166.68
so

2179.28 --> 2181.52
right

2182.0 --> 2188.24
anyway yeah several times throughout my

2184.24 --> 2188.24
life i had bits and pieces of it

2193.2 --> 2196.24
when i was 12

2197.599 --> 2201.76
maybe before even but then it just

2199.44 --> 2205.119
didn't really sink in

2201.76 --> 2207.76
i saw it as a game completely

2205.119 --> 2207.76
17

2210.16 --> 2213.16
uh

2216.24 --> 2218.4799999999996
see

2220.64 --> 2227.48
21 perhaps i'm not sure

2223.119 --> 2227.48
no no not 21. uh

2229.2 --> 2231.7599999999998
28

2234.079 --> 2236.88
2008

2238.88 --> 2243.359
pretty much

2240.32 --> 2244.56
until like 2011

2243.359 --> 2246.88
then

2244.56 --> 2251.2799999999997
yeah

2246.88 --> 2251.28
then like yeah things went wrong

2251.68 --> 2255.7599999999998
my social life

2253.44 --> 2259.079
there's my ex and all that and then yeah

2255.76 --> 2259.079
it was 2015

2261.04 --> 2264.44
through the internet

2272.079 --> 2277.5600000000004
so i hope that answers your question

2274.56 --> 2277.56
elegy

2288.96 --> 2291.96
um

2323.119 --> 2328.6400000000003
you never believed in the moon's space

2326.079 --> 2330.5600000000004
yeah the moon landings

2328.64 --> 2331.68
it was really weird with me in the moon

2330.56 --> 2334.16
landings

2331.68 --> 2334.16
because

2335.44 --> 2340.079
i actually

2337.839 --> 2343.359
with me the order of awakening really

2340.079 --> 2346.1600000000003
happened through creationism first

2343.359 --> 2349.2
then flat earth

2346.16 --> 2352.0
and then the moon landing

2349.2 --> 2354.56
because i always i've just for some

2352.0 --> 2357.599
reason always chosen to look with great

2354.56 --> 2360.7999999999997
love and fascination at the moon landing

2357.599 --> 2362.96
like i guess like a boomer

2360.8 --> 2362.96
just

2363.2 --> 2367.68
so i just never really looked carefully

2366.079 --> 2370.96
i was just like

2367.68 --> 2373.68
i totally got that dream i got that

2370.96 --> 2375.119
boomer moon landing dream

2373.68 --> 2378.0
so i just

2375.119 --> 2380.88
never really thought about it

2378.0 --> 2383.28
and in ways watching like a lot of

2380.88 --> 2385.44
gerunds videos and all that where a lot

2383.28 --> 2387.92
of it is detailed

2385.44 --> 2387.92
put on the

2388.0 --> 2392.16
put under the looking glass

2390.16 --> 2393.92
as to what's going on with the lighting

2392.16 --> 2395.44
and the things just don't make sense

2393.92 --> 2398.2400000000002
about it

2395.44 --> 2400.079
that was like it's it's still almost

2398.24 --> 2401.68
kind of shocking for me to see that

2400.079 --> 2404.6400000000003
sounds weird right

2401.68 --> 2407.44
kind of a veteran flat earther now

2404.64 --> 2410.7999999999997
but it still kind of shocks me because i

2407.44 --> 2414.48
was so much into that dream

2410.8 --> 2417.44
like i i really loved it i really loved

2414.48 --> 2421.2
the idea of it i've always really

2417.44 --> 2424.56
loved the idea of space travel and

2421.2 --> 2425.4399999999996
going to the moon and other planets

2424.56 --> 2428.0
right

2425.44 --> 2430.88
because of the exploration

2428.0 --> 2434.0
effect of it just always

2430.88 --> 2435.76
looked at it very fondly

2434.0 --> 2438.16
so to me

2435.76 --> 2442.48
the earth was flat was easier for me to

2438.16 --> 2442.48
overcome than to realize that

2443.359 --> 2447.839
like yeah

2445.28 --> 2449.92
you can't actually do that

2447.839 --> 2450.96
the moon isn't a physical place to land

2449.92 --> 2454.7200000000003
on

2450.96 --> 2454.7200000000003
that was much more confusing

2456.4 --> 2462.079
right but during that whole process of

2458.96 --> 2463.839
unraveling that in the last seven years

2462.079 --> 2465.76
well mostly like the first three of

2463.839 --> 2467.599
those

2465.76 --> 2470.0
watching about the moon landing it's

2467.599 --> 2472.2400000000002
also when basically that entire loft

2470.0 --> 2474.56
started to get replaced by just

2472.24 --> 2476.7999999999997
mechanical ideas

2474.56 --> 2478.64
about the holographic nature of the

2476.8 --> 2482.7200000000003
celestials

2478.64 --> 2485.5989999999997
that's what came in its place

2482.72 --> 2488.0789999999997
and i've kind of displaced my fondness

2485.599 --> 2488.079
energy

2488.56 --> 2494.7999999999997
for space travel exploration onto that

2491.839 --> 2496.64
onto just the marvel of them yeah this

2494.8 --> 2498.5600000000004
miraculous

2496.64 --> 2502.7599999999998
realm design

2498.56 --> 2502.7599999999998
with those holographic lights

2511.52 --> 2514.96
what

2512.72 --> 2516.56
landing a rover on tight what did they

2514.96 --> 2520.48
actually do that

2516.56 --> 2520.48
i mean officially not actually

2521.28 --> 2525.52
i mean i've been hearing so many

2524.0 --> 2528.64
promises right

2525.52 --> 2529.52
so many over the years over the decades

2528.64 --> 2530.7999999999997
just like

2529.52 --> 2532.48
oh we're going to do this we're going to

2530.8 --> 2535.2000000000003
do that and

2532.48 --> 2537.04
it never happens

2535.2 --> 2538.8799999999997
it's like almost shocking when they

2537.04 --> 2541.119
actually do something it's been like

2538.88 --> 2541.119
that

2541.44 --> 2545.599
most of it is just empty promises

2546.72 --> 2552.48
so did they actually supposedly send a

2549.28 --> 2554.5600000000004
rover to titan jim west

2552.48 --> 2556.96
did they just say they were planning to

2554.56 --> 2556.96
do that

2557.44 --> 2561.88
and then canceled it at some point

2568.16 --> 2572.8799999999997
how did i come up with the holographic

2570.0 --> 2572.88
nature of lights

2574.0 --> 2577.0
uh

2578.16 --> 2585.1189999999997
how did i come up with it it just

2582.16 --> 2587.1189999999997
it's the only thing it could be

2585.119 --> 2589.599
i just immediately noticed like there's

2587.119 --> 2589.599
something

2589.839 --> 2593.52
set

2591.28 --> 2596.079
about the lights

2593.52 --> 2598.24
all of it it it really is like a sphere

2596.079 --> 2600.48
that's around you

2598.24 --> 2600.4799999999996
like

2601.2 --> 2607.2
but that can't be

2603.52 --> 2609.2
right it can't be lamps in a sphere

2607.2 --> 2612.16
surrounding us

2609.2 --> 2615.04
because then there would be a euclidean

2612.16 --> 2617.2799999999997
aspect to it they can't beat endlessly

2615.04 --> 2620.56
far away either

2617.28 --> 2622.88
because that makes no damn sense

2620.56 --> 2624.24
with the inverse square law of light and

2622.88 --> 2627.599
like

2624.24 --> 2627.5989999999997
there's no room for that

2629.359 --> 2632.88
there's no room in the realm for that

2633.44 --> 2638.2400000000002
right so i just noticed like hey it's

2636.16 --> 2639.2
it's just always at the edge of your

2638.24 --> 2641.4399999999996
vision

2639.2 --> 2643.5989999999997
and like it just goes into the ground

2641.44 --> 2646.56
because no it's flat it's so it's just

2643.599 --> 2647.3590000000004
going into the ground it makes no sense

2646.56 --> 2649.599
so

2647.359 --> 2652.56
if it's not objects because they can't

2649.599 --> 2654.1600000000003
literally just disappear into the ground

2652.56 --> 2656.319
then there must be

2654.16 --> 2658.64
it must be like a rainbow it must be and

2656.319 --> 2660.16
the rainbow is from sun so that would

2658.64 --> 2663.2799999999997
make sense right

2660.16 --> 2664.7999999999997
it has to be a light-based phenomenon

2663.28 --> 2668.5600000000004
purely

2664.8 --> 2668.5600000000004
visual like a hologram

2670.0 --> 2672.8
and that's how i basically figured it

2671.839 --> 2674.88
out

2672.8 --> 2676.8
it took some time though

2674.88 --> 2678.96
i had to brew on the idea for a while

2676.8 --> 2682.319
but i just even with the sun just

2678.96 --> 2684.4
looking at the sun disc right

2682.319 --> 2687.04
i recommend you do it with sunglasses on

2684.4 --> 2690.4
or like squint your eyes a lot

2687.04 --> 2692.96
don't just stare into it

2690.4 --> 2695.599
it just it doesn't look like a freaking

2692.96 --> 2698.319
object it looks like a hologram to me

2695.599 --> 2700.4
like something that's just

2698.319 --> 2702.079
cut out of

2700.4 --> 2705.52
yeah

2702.079 --> 2708.6400000000003
like it's in another dimension

2705.52 --> 2710.88
it's just a cut out

2708.64 --> 2710.8799999999997
like

2711.52 --> 2716.079
in an over dimension like the fourth

2713.68 --> 2718.96
dimension or the fifth dimension

2716.079 --> 2720.8
it's it's just a cut out circle in our

2718.96 --> 2723.119
reality like there's a circle in our

2720.8 --> 2725.6800000000003
reality being cut out from a higher

2723.119 --> 2729.079
dimension

2725.68 --> 2729.0789999999997
it yeah

2733.68 --> 2738.24
it just doesn't look like an object

2736.16 --> 2739.44
at all

2738.24 --> 2742.7999999999997
there's no

2739.44 --> 2745.599
lamp or light source of any sort that

2742.8 --> 2747.44
i've ever seen or even seen footage or

2745.599 --> 2749.52
photos off

2747.44 --> 2752.56
that even comes close to actually

2749.52 --> 2752.56
looking like the sun

2752.88 --> 2755.76
this just isn't

2756.16 --> 2761.839
the way the sun disc looks is that's

2758.96 --> 2761.839
unique

2772.0 --> 2777.599
right but it did require the whole

2774.88 --> 2781.52
realization of the holographics

2777.599 --> 2783.599
it did require me actually looking at it

2781.52 --> 2785.359
because here's the thing

2783.599 --> 2788.1600000000003
when it was still about ooh space

2785.359 --> 2792.4
acceleration and landing on the moon i

2788.16 --> 2793.92
wasn't looking i wasn't looking at it

2792.4 --> 2796.48
i really wasn't

2793.92 --> 2799.28
i was looking in my head

2796.48 --> 2802.0
i was just zooming out on earth and like

2799.28 --> 2803.52
all the planets and just imagining the

2802.0 --> 2804.88
solar system

2803.52 --> 2807.119
a lot

2804.88 --> 2809.28
right i wasn't actually looking at the

2807.119 --> 2810.1600000000003
sky

2809.28 --> 2811.8390000000004
because

2810.16 --> 2813.44
it didn't really match i guess i

2811.839 --> 2815.599
couldn't look at the sky and then

2813.44 --> 2818.16
immediately have my fantasy triggered it

2815.599 --> 2821.839
just didn't work i had to

2818.16 --> 2821.839
get it from inside my head

2822.8 --> 2826.6400000000003
so when i really started to realize like

2825.52 --> 2828.96
wait

2826.64 --> 2831.5989999999997
a lot of it is made up

2828.96 --> 2834.16
there is no place you can go to other

2831.599 --> 2834.1600000000003
than earth

2834.4 --> 2839.28
and physically that is

2836.48 --> 2840.8
and then i actually started looking and

2839.28 --> 2843.599
yeah there was a whole bunch of footage

2840.8 --> 2845.599
among flat earthers like oh look at this

2843.599 --> 2847.92
oh look at the sun

2845.599 --> 2850.319
like oh it's suddenly

2847.92 --> 2852.0
like growing small and shooting into the

2850.319 --> 2856.079
distance apparently or something like

2852.0 --> 2858.8
all these weird footages it just made me

2856.079 --> 2861.3590000000004
basically go outside and like hmm i need

2858.8 --> 2863.92
to like look at that myself actually

2861.359 --> 2863.92
study it

2865.44 --> 2869.839
and then i just started to notice like

2867.839 --> 2871.839
what the hell man what have i been

2869.839 --> 2874.7999999999997
believing what i've been staring at

2871.839 --> 2876.16
inside of my mind all this time

2874.8 --> 2878.559
because that

2876.16 --> 2880.16
is nothing like what i've been staring

2878.559 --> 2883.28
at into my mind

2880.16 --> 2883.2799999999997
it's nothing alike

2884.72 --> 2890.7999999999997
and really staring at the celestials and

2887.359 --> 2893.5989999999997
the sun and the moon is what basically

2890.8 --> 2896.8
made me figure out like this is not

2893.599 --> 2899.44
these are not objects

2896.8 --> 2901.8390000000004
this is holographic and it is absolutely

2899.44 --> 2901.839
surreal

2902.4 --> 2905.44
an apparent light

2904.319 --> 2908.4
that

2905.44 --> 2910.64
just seems to be there and shine and

2908.4 --> 2912.7200000000003
have its reflections

2910.64 --> 2915.52
but it isn't actually there because if

2912.72 --> 2918.0
you'd be somewhere else

2915.52 --> 2920.88
then you can't look back at the first

2918.0 --> 2923.92
location and see

2920.88 --> 2925.76
the light effects how you saw it there

2923.92 --> 2928.559
from the first vantage point it just

2925.76 --> 2930.6400000000003
won't look like that because the then in

2928.559 --> 2933.2000000000003
the other point

2930.64 --> 2935.2799999999997
all the celestial positions and all the

2933.2 --> 2937.68
light effects that come from them are

2935.28 --> 2941.6400000000003
positioned differently

2937.68 --> 2941.64
it's just not the same

2969.92 --> 2974.88
yeah what matthew hall

2971.839 --> 2979.52
okay that's a weird story

2974.88 --> 2979.52
5 million lumen spotlight damn

2980.48 --> 2984.68
that's like a stadium spotlight

3001.92 --> 3007.2400000000002
lakes of methane what are you talking

3003.68 --> 3007.24
about jim west

3019.2 --> 3024.319
when you can see all the details of the

3021.44 --> 3027.359
sun are those legit

3024.319 --> 3029.44
that depends

3027.359 --> 3032.5589999999997
there's two different types of sightings

3029.44 --> 3034.64
i've seen of the sun one is actual sun

3032.559 --> 3037.599
and there are weird little things there

3034.64 --> 3040.96
are sunspots it does seem to like have a

3037.599 --> 3042.2400000000002
weird apparent rotor rotate to re-effect

3040.96 --> 3043.44
even

3042.24 --> 3045.839
or like

3043.44 --> 3046.7200000000003
it scrolls by it's more like there's a

3045.839 --> 3049.04
hole

3046.72 --> 3051.7599999999998
and a band with dots on it and it just

3049.04 --> 3054.48
scrolls by it's not actually

3051.76 --> 3057.92
spherically scrolling by

3054.48 --> 3060.319
it's like a flat scroll

3057.92 --> 3061.52
has anybody noticed that

3060.319 --> 3063.44
when you look at the sun with the

3061.52 --> 3065.92
filters and the sunspots

3063.44 --> 3067.76
then over time it's not like something

3065.92 --> 3070.16
is rotating

3067.76 --> 3072.48
it's like it's crawling by

3070.16 --> 3075.52
really weird

3072.48 --> 3077.44
it's flat it's scrolling by flat it's

3075.52 --> 3080.4
not a repeating

3077.44 --> 3083.28
rotatory surface

3080.4 --> 3085.6800000000003
really weird

3083.28 --> 3087.6800000000003
so that's what i noticed about the sun

3085.68 --> 3091.9199999999996
and then of course there's the giant

3087.68 --> 3095.24
fiery cgi ball which is a cgi project

3091.92 --> 3095.2400000000002
100 percent

3096.72 --> 3100.72
and that has absolutely nothing to do

3098.72 --> 3103.04
with the real sighting of earth of a

3100.72 --> 3107.72
from earth

3103.04 --> 3107.72
with telescopes and all that and

3120.16 --> 3126.0
but yeah the celestials are all of them

3123.119 --> 3128.7200000000003
are very mysterious

3126.0 --> 3132.16
it's not just one little thing it's just

3128.72 --> 3133.1189999999997
this weird dynamic thing a lot of them

3132.16 --> 3136.24
right

3133.119 --> 3138.88
like the moon is freaking weird

3136.24 --> 3141.7599999999998
this apparent

3138.88 --> 3144.48
craters and like this yeah the apparent

3141.76 --> 3145.76
shadow that's like super weird and

3144.48 --> 3148.72
surreal

3145.76 --> 3151.5200000000004
and very suggestive

3148.72 --> 3152.3999999999996
right but the sun also has it really

3151.52 --> 3155.28
weird

3152.4 --> 3157.2000000000003
oddities to it

3155.28 --> 3161.0400000000004
and then just take a look at freaking

3157.2 --> 3163.5989999999997
venus man now that's freaking weird

3161.04 --> 3166.72
like venus is so weird it doesn't really

3163.599 --> 3168.559
even fit in the heliocentric model

3166.72 --> 3171.7599999999998
the sightings that we have

3168.559 --> 3174.2400000000002
that venus lights up like almost as

3171.76 --> 3176.96
bright as the sun

3174.24 --> 3176.9599999999996
in the morning

3177.2 --> 3183.359
he rides

3179.599 --> 3185.44
that makes no freaking sense whatsoever

3183.359 --> 3187.839
like whatsoever

3185.44 --> 3190.4
like at all

3187.839 --> 3192.839
like why the hell would venus be

3190.4 --> 3195.92
lighting up like a mini

3192.839 --> 3199.04
sun in the morning and then not be like

3195.92 --> 3200.16
that the rest of the day

3199.04 --> 3202.24
i mean

3200.16 --> 3204.319
if that was because it's closer to the

3202.24 --> 3207.839
sun well why don't we see the same

3204.319 --> 3212.319
freaking thing with mercury

3207.839 --> 3212.319
which is even closer it makes no sense

3213.28 --> 3219.119
right the celestials are really weird

3216.8 --> 3221.04
when you actually look at what's really

3219.119 --> 3223.839
visible

3221.04 --> 3223.839
and how that works

3236.8 --> 3242.559
on titan they claimed images of licks of

3240.079 --> 3244.8
methane oh sure

3242.559 --> 3247.44
right but they gotta like give you some

3244.8 --> 3247.44
description

3249.359 --> 3254.64
i mean of course you can just

3252.079 --> 3257.3590000000004
look at something at insane distances

3254.64 --> 3260.16
and just determine exactly what material

3257.359 --> 3263.52
it is you're looking at of course

3260.16 --> 3266.64
makes so much sense right

3263.52 --> 3268.96
although they actually don't do that

3266.64 --> 3272.0789999999997
they just look at something

3268.96 --> 3274.7200000000003
then they calculate determine what the

3272.079 --> 3277.119
temperature must be

3274.72 --> 3279.52
according to their overall modeling and

3277.119 --> 3281.52
sizing up of the distance versus the sun

3279.52 --> 3284.16
what should the temperature be

3281.52 --> 3285.92
they're basically engineering what they

3284.16 --> 3288.3999999999996
think

3285.92 --> 3290.16
they should be looking at

3288.4 --> 3292.799
and then you say oh oh look we're

3290.16 --> 3295.359
looking at a methane lake

3292.799 --> 3297.599
but no they're just

3295.359 --> 3300.0
basically making that up like yeah there

3297.599 --> 3301.6800000000003
should be there might be a methane lake

3300.0 --> 3303.28
there let's just say that's a methane

3301.68 --> 3305.5989999999997
lake

3303.28 --> 3308.7200000000003
right oh we just spotted a methane lake

3305.599 --> 3308.7200000000003
that's kind of what they do

3310.559 --> 3314.3190000000004
they size it up they calculate what they

3312.88 --> 3315.92
think

3314.319 --> 3317.92
it should be

3315.92 --> 3321.04
according to the model and then they

3317.92 --> 3323.2000000000003
just say it is that

3321.04 --> 3324.4
oh thank you for the super chat

3323.2 --> 3327.4399999999996
godzilla

3324.4 --> 3327.44
reigning diamonds

3327.76 --> 3332.8390000000004
yeah yeah they're reigning diamonds of

3329.44 --> 3332.839
saturn right

3337.76 --> 3342.76
it was a jupiter i don't remember

3370.16 --> 3375.2
you believe vince's clouds reflect most

3373.599 --> 3377.839
of the sunlight

3375.2 --> 3377.839
how

3378.16 --> 3381.5989999999997
how is it doing that elegy

3386.799 --> 3391.48
do you have any idea what the actual

3391.68 --> 3395.68
light intensity must be

3396.88 --> 3401.2000000000003
and why would the clouds reflect that

3399.119 --> 3403.359
like a mirror right you're literally

3401.2 --> 3406.16
saying it's like a mirror it would have

3403.359 --> 3408.5589999999997
to be if it's literally as intense as

3406.16 --> 3408.5589999999997
the sun

3408.96 --> 3414.4
so you're saying that venus has like

3412.0 --> 3417.4
mirror clouds is that what you're

3414.4 --> 3417.4
suggesting

3418.559 --> 3420.88
how

3421.839 --> 3427.2799999999997
how can you justify that even in a

3424.0 --> 3429.92
theoretical construct

3427.28 --> 3433.48
i mean i've never heard of these mirror

3429.92 --> 3433.48
clouds before

3456.4 --> 3460.76
hey lsg good to see you

3487.48 --> 3493.2
[Music]

3490.24 --> 3493.2
gas clouds

3493.76 --> 3497.0400000000004
now i was talking about

3497.119 --> 3502.4
venus and why it's so

3499.359 --> 3505.119
incredibly bright in the morning like as

3502.4 --> 3505.92
bright as the sun

3505.119 --> 3508.319
and

3505.92 --> 3511.119
elegy suggested that

3508.319 --> 3514.0
the clouds were of venus were just

3511.119 --> 3516.4
reflecting the sunlight but

3514.0 --> 3518.0
that's kind of crazy

3516.4 --> 3518.88
because

3518.0 --> 3521.2
yeah

3518.88 --> 3523.599
in reality

3521.2 --> 3525.1189999999997
physical reality if you want to reflect

3523.599 --> 3526.48
sunlight

3525.119 --> 3528.88
to a degree

3526.48 --> 3531.2
or like any light to a degree that it's

3528.88 --> 3534.48
just as intense as the original source

3531.2 --> 3537.7599999999998
you're going to have to utilize

3534.48 --> 3537.76
mirror-like qualities

3537.839 --> 3543.2
because just like white yeah it reflects

3541.119 --> 3546.079
some light it does bit right it's not

3543.2 --> 3546.8799999999997
going to be as bright as the source

3546.079 --> 3549.76
and

3546.88 --> 3553.76
yeah venus in the morning it is it's

3549.76 --> 3556.96
just it's crazy bright crazy

3553.76 --> 3559.44
brightest star in the sky the brightest

3556.96 --> 3562.7200000000003
planet in the sky ever

3559.44 --> 3564.96
it's brighter than the freaking moon

3562.72 --> 3566.48
a lot brighter

3564.96 --> 3569.28
so

3566.48 --> 3572.799
yeah the only way i could envision

3569.28 --> 3576.1600000000003
like that could work is that

3572.799 --> 3577.44
all the clouds on venus

3576.16 --> 3580.24
would be

3577.44 --> 3582.799
somehow having like this perfect mirror

3580.24 --> 3585.2
reflect reflection quality they would

3582.799 --> 3586.48
have to have that in order to achieve

3585.2 --> 3589.68
anything like that

3586.48 --> 3591.68
even in the theoretical model

3589.68 --> 3594.48
and i don't even think that's the claim

3591.68 --> 3598.16
there's like pictures of venus uh

3594.48 --> 3601.119
yeah the pictures of venus don't look

3598.16 --> 3602.96
like you're just looking at black

3601.119 --> 3605.2000000000003
which is what kind of you would be

3602.96 --> 3607.599
looking at if it the clouds were

3605.2 --> 3609.52
mirror-like they would be reflecting

3607.599 --> 3611.3590000000004
outer space

3609.52 --> 3614.319
if you'd photograph it

3611.359 --> 3619.119
you see

3614.319 --> 3621.44
and no it's not it's just like white

3619.119 --> 3625.2000000000003
clouds

3621.44 --> 3626.839
well white can't reflect light

3625.2 --> 3628.5589999999997
to the same

3626.839 --> 3630.5589999999997
degree

3628.559 --> 3632.48
that the what you're going to see of it

3630.559 --> 3634.559
is going to be as bright as the original

3632.48 --> 3637.44
source it just doesn't do that you have

3634.559 --> 3638.799
to have mirror like reflection for it

3637.44 --> 3640.839
and venus

3638.799 --> 3643.839
doesn't seem to even have the

3640.839 --> 3645.599
claim of mirror like reflection

3643.839 --> 3647.839
qualities

3645.599 --> 3647.839
ah

3649.2 --> 3654.04
so yeah celestials they're very

3651.04 --> 3654.04
mysterious

3660.16 --> 3665.839
it's not as yeah it is lydia logs

3663.76 --> 3669.7990000000004
it is

3665.839 --> 3669.799
it's freaking blinding

3670.079 --> 3678.28
we're starting with venus in the morning

3674.319 --> 3678.2799999999997
that's freaking bright

3690.16 --> 3693.16
oh

3701.599 --> 3706.76
oh beetle what the [ __ ] is that

3709.86 --> 3713.239
[Applause]

3727.119 --> 3731.119
all right reflective qualities

3733.68 --> 3736.68
75

3736.96 --> 3744.039
on venus how

3740.16 --> 3744.0389999999998
how is it doing that

3757.28 --> 3760.96
do you think you get scared yeah but

3762.96 --> 3770.48
it's always the same [ __ ]

3766.079 --> 3770.48
i hate ball believers i really do

3770.72 --> 3774.5589999999997
just can't help themselves

3779.68 --> 3784.319
it's not a percentage

3783.2 --> 3786.64
okay

3784.319 --> 3788.72
all i know it's really freaking bright

3786.64 --> 3790.24
it's very small

3788.72 --> 3793.2
and it's like

3790.24 --> 3795.2
a mirror it's reflecting the light like

3793.2 --> 3796.96
a mirror if you're gonna assume it is

3795.2 --> 3801.2
even an object

3796.96 --> 3801.2
it's really insanely bright

3804.24 --> 3808.4799999999996
it would have to be

3805.76 --> 3808.48
like a mirror

3809.039 --> 3817.1600000000003
yet it's just supposedly clouds

3812.96 --> 3817.16
i don't see how that's possible

3825.28 --> 3829.2000000000003
what venus has phases really

3831.44 --> 3835.2400000000002
i didn't even know that

3847.119 --> 3853.0
yes lydia logs we heard you

3881.119 --> 3883.44
what

3883.76 --> 3886.7200000000003
really

3888.48 --> 3893.359
crystals

3890.119 --> 3896.96
suspended in gases

3893.359 --> 3896.96
what the [ __ ]

3897.599 --> 3900.7200000000003
okay

3898.559 --> 3902.3190000000004
can you demonstrate that

3900.72 --> 3905.0389999999998
lg

3902.319 --> 3906.96
crystals suspended in the mixture of

3905.039 --> 3910.7200000000003
gases could could you give you a

3906.96 --> 3910.7200000000003
demonstration of how that works

3919.52 --> 3924.4
i mean

3920.839 --> 3928.88
why wouldn't the crystals

3924.4 --> 3928.88
just settle down on the surface

3929.599 --> 3935.7200000000003
why would they be suspended in these

3931.839 --> 3935.72
gases this is ridiculous

3950.9 --> 3954.05
[Music]

3960.16 --> 3964.96
it's like a puddle of helium yeah

3962.64 --> 3966.4
it's it's very liberal with like the

3964.96 --> 3970.68
physics

3966.4 --> 3970.6800000000003
indeed wrath for sure

3985.039 --> 3988.039
so

3995.28 --> 3997.92
yeah

3996.48 --> 4000.4
i'm still

3997.92 --> 4001.359
i'm still laughing about what elegy just

4000.4 --> 4003.92
said

4001.359 --> 4004.839
he probably just copied it off some wiki

4003.92 --> 4008.2400000000002
or

4004.839 --> 4008.73
something it's like

4008.24 --> 4010.5589999999997
oh

4008.73 --> 4014.799
[Music]

4010.559 --> 4017.52
droplets of sulfuric acid

4014.799 --> 4020.48
and crystals

4017.52 --> 4023.599
like sulfuric acid crystals

4020.48 --> 4026.88
suspended in gases

4023.599 --> 4029.839
so it's like smoke particles right which

4026.88 --> 4032.4
are like little solids carbon particles

4029.839 --> 4034.72
they're suspended in gases

4032.4 --> 4037.119
the thing about smoke is

4034.72 --> 4040.72
it comes down

4037.119 --> 4040.7200000000003
eventually the particles

4040.96 --> 4046.599
they all

4042.72 --> 4046.5989999999997
they all go down

4050.079 --> 4056.319
so

4051.52 --> 4056.319
how is it suspended in the gas

4057.039 --> 4060.6800000000003
i don't get it

4068.559 --> 4075.559
no i have not looked at anything through

4071.2 --> 4075.5589999999997
a telescope lydia logs

4093.039 --> 4099.359
yeah steamy traveler no it's liquid all

4096.4 --> 4103.2789999999995
the clouds are liquid

4099.359 --> 4106.4800000000005
right and the really heavy rain happens

4103.279 --> 4108.64
when the liquid of the clouds start

4106.48 --> 4109.759
starts to freeze up

4108.64 --> 4112.64
right

4109.759 --> 4115.6
and then as in the solid state well the

4112.64 --> 4119.04
density takes hold it falls down

4115.6 --> 4121.359
and then on its way down it warms up

4119.04 --> 4125.6
and then turns into

4121.359 --> 4130.839
rain and that's how we get rain right

4125.6 --> 4135.52
because solids don't stay hanging in the

4130.839 --> 4137.92
air they always go down eventually right

4135.52 --> 4142.080000000001
might be blown up for a bit but then

4137.92 --> 4142.08
they will come down again always do

4142.719 --> 4148.64
but yeah liquids can kind of stay

4144.88 --> 4148.64
suspended that's what clouds are

4149.199 --> 4156.0
and they either dissolve back

4152.64 --> 4157.52
into the warmer air and then yeah become

4156.0 --> 4160.239
vapor again

4157.52 --> 4163.040000000001
or they just hang there

4160.239 --> 4165.759
until like so much of it builds up and

4163.04 --> 4167.5199999999995
the temperatures get cooler that ice

4165.759 --> 4169.359
forms

4167.52 --> 4171.679
within the cloud

4169.359 --> 4173.279
and that actually then falls down and on

4171.679 --> 4175.839
its way down melts and that's how you

4173.279 --> 4175.839000000001
get rain

4183.359 --> 4187.4400000000005
i'm not pissed off lydia logs i'm just

4185.839 --> 4190.159
annoyed

4187.44 --> 4192.0
it's just a stupid standard like oh look

4190.159 --> 4193.199
at this look at that oh look at this

4192.0 --> 4195.6
thing oh

4193.199 --> 4197.759999999999
look at the keys oh now i'm talking

4195.6 --> 4200.400000000001
about

4197.76 --> 4202.4800000000005
venus in the morning have you ever

4200.4 --> 4205.5199999999995
looked at venus

4202.48 --> 4208.32
through a telescope in the morning

4205.52 --> 4208.320000000001
lydia logs

4209.04 --> 4213.719
why annoy because you keep asking

4217.36 --> 4220.639999999999
because you're

4218.48 --> 4224.159
currently just complaining about what

4220.64 --> 4224.159000000001
i'm doing that's why

4225.12 --> 4230.92
you have all right

4227.36 --> 4230.92
what did you see

4237.76 --> 4241.76
actually it does kind of sound

4239.199 --> 4244.96
interesting

4241.76 --> 4246.719
i think i'd like to look at venus

4244.96 --> 4250.4
through a telescope in the morning one

4246.719 --> 4250.4
time at least that would be pretty cool

4257.679 --> 4262.4800000000005
right anyway i've

4259.84 --> 4264.32
i've already basically just

4262.48 --> 4267.12
they're doing this right now yeah the

4264.32 --> 4270.719
ballers lydia logs

4267.12 --> 4272.8
in chat is doing it because i already

4270.719 --> 4275.04
i basically presupposed the entire

4272.8 --> 4276.8
heliocentric model and then said how is

4275.04 --> 4279.92
this possible yeah i shouldn't have done

4276.8 --> 4283.84
that like it's not possible

4279.92 --> 4286.4800000000005
it's holographics and they're very weird

4283.84 --> 4288.56
and i shouldn't even be wondering like

4286.48 --> 4291.44
how do would that mechanical thing in

4288.56 --> 4293.52
the heliocentric model make sense

4291.44 --> 4296.719
because it only

4293.52 --> 4298.64
gives room for ball believers to do

4296.719 --> 4301.84
that

4298.64 --> 4301.84
right there

4302.08 --> 4306.48
because they're they're like oh but you

4304.159 --> 4308.879999999999
don't understand the heliocentric model

4306.48 --> 4311.599999999999
yeah that's what you get

4308.88 --> 4313.36
it's my own fault i should have never

4311.6 --> 4314.64
even brought it there but it is i'm

4313.36 --> 4316.719
still

4314.64 --> 4319.12
asking questions from heliocentric

4316.719 --> 4322.4
perspectives

4319.12 --> 4324.239
i just tend to do that

4322.4 --> 4327.44
i do kind of like conjuring the

4324.239 --> 4330.4
heliocentric model in my mind you see

4327.44 --> 4332.0
it's interesting to do

4330.4 --> 4333.36
but it's also

4332.0 --> 4335.92
pointless

4333.36 --> 4338.08
because every time i do that in public

4335.92 --> 4341.28
i'm only

4338.08 --> 4343.04
making ball believers say oh

4341.28 --> 4345.199
you don't really understand the

4343.04 --> 4348.56
heliocentric model it's cause that's

4345.199 --> 4352.919999999999
what they always do

4348.56 --> 4352.92
every single time

4359.52 --> 4364.280000000001
let's what the hell is you

4371.04 --> 4373.6
that's weird

4382.84 --> 4389.92
yeah cool that's all very nice looking

4386.719 --> 4391.44
at things through telescopes

4389.92 --> 4393.12
you're never going to go there though

4391.44 --> 4397.12
you're never going to see an angular

4393.12 --> 4401.12
size increase as you approach it

4397.12 --> 4401.12
because that doesn't exist

4403.199 --> 4407.199
like at all

4404.56 --> 4409.4400000000005
with any of it even with the moon then

4407.199 --> 4411.12
the moon is suggested to be incredibly

4409.44 --> 4413.28
close

4411.12 --> 4415.679
right that's the suggestion in the model

4413.28 --> 4416.5599999999995
and there's no angular size increase as

4415.679 --> 4421.84
you

4416.56 --> 4421.84
go towards its apparent location

4422.0 --> 4426.0
there's no angular size increase there

4423.84 --> 4430.2390000000005
would be there would be constant angular

4426.0 --> 4430.239
size increase of the moon especially

4431.92 --> 4435.6
because it's a it's supposed to be a

4434.0 --> 4437.6
physical object

4435.6 --> 4440.4800000000005
very close by it's the closest

4437.6 --> 4442.88
billuminary

4440.48 --> 4444.239
in the heliocentric model

4442.88 --> 4446.96
yet

4444.239 --> 4449.919999999999
there is no angular size increase in

4446.96 --> 4452.56
decrease that matches

4449.92 --> 4454.88
with it as an object in relation to

4452.56 --> 4457.92
presupposed ball earth there is no match

4454.88 --> 4457.92
to that at all

4463.36 --> 4466.92
who do you think

4468.64 --> 4470.88
well

4472.96 --> 4477.199
the moon disappears for three days

4475.6 --> 4480.320000000001
completely

4477.199 --> 4482.719
no trace no shadow

4480.32 --> 4485.12
right no light

4482.719 --> 4487.44
being shown from behind

4485.12 --> 4490.719
from a slightly off angle and then you

4487.44 --> 4493.12
see a shadow cast by the sun

4490.719 --> 4494.8
on the on the side of the moon facing

4493.12 --> 4497.12
you so that you could just see oh look

4494.8 --> 4499.1990000000005
there's this black

4497.12 --> 4502.0
thing there that's the moon because it's

4499.199 --> 4504.4
lit from behind by the sun yeah you

4502.0 --> 4507.52
don't get to see that ever

4504.4 --> 4510.48
not a single time it doesn't exist yeah

4507.52 --> 4514.320000000001
so whatever a solar eclipse is it's not

4510.48 --> 4514.32
the moon moving in front of the sun

4514.719 --> 4518.96
it's freaking invisible the moon isn't

4517.28 --> 4522.599999999999
there for three days

4518.96 --> 4522.6
every time that happens

4544.96 --> 4550.0
is there an angular sizing no steamy

4547.52 --> 4552.719
traveler

4550.0 --> 4555.44
no that's literally looking up close

4552.719 --> 4558.64
angular size increase would be relating

4555.44 --> 4560.639999999999
to actual position change in relation to

4558.64 --> 4563.52
the object

4560.64 --> 4567.1990000000005
yeah as you approach its angular size

4563.52 --> 4570.2390000000005
becomes bigger to you as an observer

4567.199 --> 4572.799999999999
looking at something through a telescope

4570.239 --> 4576.159
doesn't work because you're not actually

4572.8 --> 4576.159000000001
physically approaching it

4576.48 --> 4581.718999999999
it's just looking really up close that's

4578.719 --> 4581.719
all

4600.64 --> 4603.64
um

4612.159 --> 4617.04
no any wayne right

4615.28 --> 4618.639999999999
oh you can't see it because it's too

4617.04 --> 4620.56
bright oh really

4618.64 --> 4623.76
then why don't you see

4620.56 --> 4625.679
a pitch black shadow

4623.76 --> 4628.320000000001
where the moon is because

4625.679 --> 4631.36
yeah it's blocking the sun partially

4628.32 --> 4635.04
right you're still going to see a shadow

4631.36 --> 4635.04
you don't just see nothing

4635.52 --> 4638.4800000000005
yeah

4636.56 --> 4639.76
when you're looking up against a really

4638.48 --> 4641.759999999999
bright light

4639.76 --> 4643.4400000000005
and there's an object there

4641.76 --> 4646.4800000000005
it's right in front of it yeah it blocks

4643.44 --> 4649.04
this bright light if it's not

4646.48 --> 4651.5199999999995
it's still gonna be black it's still

4649.04 --> 4654.48
gonna have a massive shadow cast from

4651.52 --> 4656.8
that bright light to you as an observer

4654.48 --> 4658.32
why don't we see that ever it's just

4656.8 --> 4662.28
gone

4658.32 --> 4662.28
that makes no sense

4679.12 --> 4685.36
we don't see yeah no no amy wayne right

4684.159 --> 4688.159
you don't see

4685.36 --> 4689.599999999999
no stars during the daytime for the same

4688.159 --> 4693.12
reason

4689.6 --> 4696.2390000000005
yeah the moon is supposed to be a very

4693.12 --> 4697.199
big physical object that's really close

4696.239 --> 4699.12
by

4697.199 --> 4703.599999999999
the stars

4699.12 --> 4703.599999999999
are astronomical distances away

4704.32 --> 4710.5599999999995
makes no sense there's a physical object

4707.76 --> 4714.08
obstructing very bright light

4710.56 --> 4718.64
close by you should be seeing a black

4714.08 --> 4721.679
spot where it's blocking the light

4718.64 --> 4724.08
that's not the same reason why you don't

4721.679 --> 4725.76
see stars during the day

4724.08 --> 4728.08
it's ridiculous that's a whole nother

4725.76 --> 4731.08
issue by the way

4728.08 --> 4731.08
right

4738.56 --> 4742.6
hey woodworking gummy bear

4781.44 --> 4787.12
a black spot in daytime yeah

4784.4 --> 4787.12
that's right

4788.56 --> 4792.4800000000005
it's close to the sun right

4791.6 --> 4794.4800000000005
sun

4792.48 --> 4796.718999999999
is shining

4794.48 --> 4800.159
right past it

4796.719 --> 4801.6
it's right there past it

4800.159 --> 4802.839999999999
you should see

4801.6 --> 4806.639
a black

4802.84 --> 4808.32
spot the shadow of that really bright

4806.639 --> 4809.28
light

4808.32 --> 4810.96
right

4809.28 --> 4814.639
it's scattering

4810.96 --> 4816.4800000000005
supposedly causing all that blue

4814.639 --> 4818.719
doesn't yeah there's no real proof for

4816.48 --> 4821.678999999999
that by the way

4818.719 --> 4824.32
but yeah the moon

4821.679 --> 4827.12
should be a part that is obstructing

4824.32 --> 4827.12
that effect

4828.32 --> 4837.759999999999
you should see a black spot

4832.56 --> 4837.76
where an object is obstructing the light

4839.04 --> 4843.12
you should see that

4840.719 --> 4845.679
you don't it just disappears the moon is

4843.12 --> 4847.679
gone for three days is nothing there

4845.679 --> 4850.08
nothing no shadow

4847.679 --> 4850.08
nothing

4852.239 --> 4855.799999999999
makes no sense

4860.32 --> 4864.96
yeah back to work for you

4862.32 --> 4864.96
that's right

4866.96 --> 4871.08
right i'm rounding out the show

4877.679 --> 4882.96
oh god

4880.719 --> 4884.719
can't i see polaris from australia

4882.96 --> 4889.56
because it's you don't get to see

4884.719 --> 4889.56
polaris from australia that's why

4890.0 --> 4897.36
the celestial is out of visible reach

4894.32 --> 4900.32
the apparent celestial sphere turns in

4897.36 --> 4902.96
relation to your position on earth

4900.32 --> 4905.199
you don't get to see polaris the

4902.96 --> 4907.28
apparition

4905.199 --> 4909.599999999999
you don't get to see it in australia

4907.28 --> 4911.92
that's why

4909.6 --> 4913.92
not because you're on an other side of

4911.92 --> 4916.159
the ball underneath the giant ball of

4913.92 --> 4917.84
stars

4916.159 --> 4920.5599999999995
earth is flat

4917.84 --> 4922.88
celestials are holographic

4920.56 --> 4924.8
right anyway thanks everyone for coming

4922.88 --> 4928.2390000000005
i hope you like this show

4924.8 --> 4931.679
started out a bit slow i guess

4928.239 --> 4934.239
i don't know why but yeah got a lot of

4931.679 --> 4937.28
flat earth back and forth

4934.239 --> 4939.28
the second half at least

4937.28 --> 4942.0
i hope you enjoyed it

4939.28 --> 4944.0
anyway if you liked my show then please

4982.56 --> 4985.52
on tuesday and i'm gonna join the flat

4984.239 --> 4987.599999999999
earth debates

4985.52 --> 4989.92
which should start up any minute now

4987.6 --> 4990.8
hope to see you there in chat

4989.92 --> 4995.36
