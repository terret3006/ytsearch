81.36 --> 85.6
so

83.439 --> 87.83999999999999
yeah the weather has changed around a

85.6 --> 87.83999999999999
little

88.72 --> 91.52
kind of back to

92.88 --> 97.439
two days ago so it is still kind of

95.52 --> 99.03999999999999
clear sky but there's

97.439 --> 102.63999999999999
plenty of

99.04 --> 102.64
cloudy and haziness

105.439 --> 110.0
and it is absorbing the sunlight

107.52 --> 110.0
somewhat

112.799 --> 117.52000000000001
so yeah it's not as bright and

115.52 --> 120.0
warm as it was yesterday because of that

117.52 --> 122.079
i think

120.0 --> 125.2
but yeah it has been clearing up so

122.079 --> 125.19999999999999
maybe it's actually

125.92 --> 130.72
gonna be a pretty blue day or blue

128.319 --> 133.35999999999999
afternoon here

130.72 --> 133.35999999999999
in a few

140.16 --> 143.599
because it was much more clouded this

142.08 --> 145.28
morning

143.599 --> 147.44
and

145.28 --> 149.84
my prediction

147.44 --> 152.64
from yesterday did come true it was a

149.84 --> 153.92000000000002
very cold night because it stayed

152.64 --> 158.55999999999997
clear

153.92 --> 158.55999999999997
most of it and it did cool down a lot

160.0 --> 166.16
surprisingly there were not too many it

162.48 --> 169.04
wasn't too bright a star sky

166.16 --> 169.04
but still some

169.28 --> 174.879
hello slow mo moon buggy first in chat

172.319 --> 179.51899999999998
service day hello dutch sailor

174.879 --> 179.51899999999998
stone monkey 3d pj khushan cleary

180.64 --> 187.64
it is sunday the 10th

183.84 --> 187.64000000000001
of october 2021

193.599 --> 197.07999999999998
and i am

200.56 --> 205.519
i'm doing good i have decent sleep

205.76 --> 210.79899999999998
made dinner yesterday pretty much during

208.4 --> 212.799
ball busters like they started out

210.799 --> 214.72
talking about food again and it was like

212.799 --> 216.87900000000002
okay i can't

214.72 --> 220.48
handle this i have to cook now and it

216.879 --> 220.48
took me at least an hour

221.28 --> 226.64000000000001
but i did make it back in time for the

223.84 --> 228.799
end which lasted much longer than kiwi

226.64 --> 229.92
really wanted because he wanted dinner

228.799 --> 232.48000000000002
too

229.92 --> 234.07999999999998
but a guy

232.48 --> 236.64
was in the panel

234.08 --> 239.43900000000002
and he started to ask questions and

236.64 --> 242.07999999999998
pretty decent questions

239.439 --> 244.0
and then yeah that was everybody got all

242.08 --> 245.68
fired up

244.0 --> 248.0
in a good way

245.68 --> 250.15900000000002
so yeah ball busters turned out to be

248.0 --> 252.319
live after all yesterday and i did get

250.159 --> 254.79899999999998
on there

252.319 --> 259.12
but yeah i wasn't super active because i

254.799 --> 259.12
was busy with my dinner most of the time

259.519 --> 266.0
nathan was really on fire by the way

263.04 --> 268.56
so if you haven't checked that show out

266.0 --> 271.84
i definitely recommend you watch that

268.56 --> 271.84
it's worth worth it

272.24 --> 276.479
over at quantum eraser channel

277.919 --> 281.08
all right

284.0 --> 287.96
let me link that up

296.0 --> 300.08
right so this is a link to yesterday's

298.0 --> 303.039
show

300.08 --> 303.039
on blow busters

303.6 --> 305.84000000000003
uh

306.0 --> 310.8
what was for dinner uh okay yeah

308.24 --> 313.28000000000003
something very elaborate

310.8 --> 315.759
and afterward i even realized i forgot

313.28 --> 317.59999999999997
like a critical ingredient so i'm gonna

315.759 --> 320.8
mix that in today

317.6 --> 323.44
but i make it made like a dick

320.8 --> 323.44
i call that

337.28 --> 340.55999999999995
oriental cooking pan

339.6 --> 343.12
uh

340.56 --> 345.199
and i uh

343.12 --> 348.16
basically did chicken

345.199 --> 349.759
and a lot of vegetables

348.16 --> 353.56
so what i did

349.759 --> 353.56
i'm gonna talk food

354.4 --> 359.12
hold on let me get back to my own

356.24 --> 361.199
channel right

359.12 --> 363.199
better call saul the other day

361.199 --> 365.12
yeah i watched that a while back

363.199 --> 367.52000000000004
it's interesting

365.12 --> 371.12
but very dubious but yeah that's blade

367.52 --> 371.12
in the office anyway hey

373.52 --> 378.56
quantum erasers the dinosaurs

376.72 --> 380.72
they were dyed

378.56 --> 382.96
yeah i love that one too

380.72 --> 386.96000000000004
slow mo moon boogie

382.96 --> 389.75899999999996
a bit like a bit of chinese cooking yeah

386.96 --> 392.63899999999995
i guess it could be it's it's

389.759 --> 395.84000000000003
it was kind of oriental

392.639 --> 398.08
so what i did was just coconut oil

395.84 --> 398.08
the

398.56 --> 404.8
like with the coconut flavor still in it

402.0 --> 407.6
so pretty much like well raw

404.8 --> 409.12
coconut oil

407.6 --> 412.72
and

409.12 --> 412.72
put lots of garlic in it

412.88 --> 416.56
like pretty much an entire loaf

417.039 --> 421.36
and it was like a lot of coconut oil

419.12 --> 421.36
like

421.52 --> 425.84
maybe a quarter of a liter maybe more

428.0 --> 430.479
is that a liter

429.599 --> 431.68
yeah

430.479 --> 433.44
yeah

431.68 --> 435.919
i did measure it out i don't measure

433.44 --> 439.199
things i just i just start scooping and

435.919 --> 440.15999999999997
then i'm like yeah this is good

439.199 --> 442.40000000000003
and it

440.16 --> 444.40000000000003
almost always works out these days in

442.4 --> 447.039
the beginning and it was i was clumsy at

444.4 --> 449.44
it over did things under did things but

447.039 --> 451.039
you learn from that i learn intuitively

449.44 --> 453.36
anyway

451.039 --> 457.199
coconut oil garlic

453.36 --> 457.199
chicken in there and yeah that

458.319 --> 463.759
had like two separately bought

461.599 --> 466.639
chicken fillet

463.759 --> 468.639
but the oldest one was like uh uh yeah

466.639 --> 470.96000000000004
over date

468.639 --> 473.039
but um yeah i know from experience that

470.96 --> 475.84
that is like an industrial size up so i

473.039 --> 479.84
basically washed the meat

475.84 --> 479.84
it wasn't all cut up yet so i washed it

479.919 --> 484.08
to get like the bacterial

482.72 --> 487.36
toxins

484.08 --> 489.68
which they do develop

487.36 --> 492.47900000000004
but to get most of them out

489.68 --> 494.879
and then yeah the coconut oil

492.479 --> 497.28
baking it in that that should make it

494.879 --> 498.56
just fine and it is it turned out to be

497.28 --> 500.79999999999995
just fine

498.56 --> 500.8
right

500.879 --> 504.24
it's all organic anyway

504.84 --> 509.919
uh yeah what else put it do i put in

507.68 --> 509.919
there

516.399 --> 523.279
yeah lots of salt and pepper

520.8 --> 525.76
i really do like that in there as well

523.279 --> 527.12
salt pepper garlic just makes

525.76 --> 529.36
makes almost

527.12 --> 531.839
everything tasty

529.36 --> 535.12
uh yeah i did some other stuff in there

531.839 --> 536.8800000000001
i can't figure it out right now

535.12 --> 539.839
um

536.88 --> 541.8389999999999
then pretty much

539.839 --> 543.6800000000001
okay now i'm gonna go to vegetable

541.839 --> 546.6800000000001
translations which is like quite a

543.68 --> 546.68
hassle

560.64 --> 566.64
green beans that's it

562.72 --> 566.64
green beans broccoli

566.72 --> 571.279
celery

569.04 --> 571.279
uh

574.64 --> 577.8389999999999
oh my god

578.16 --> 583.92
carrots

580.08 --> 587.6
i'm gonna forget that that's stupid uh

583.92 --> 591.16
what else what else what's in there

587.6 --> 591.16
and then oh yeah

591.519 --> 595.92
so that's pretty much the vegetables

593.12 --> 599.2
that got in there

595.92 --> 601.8389999999999
and then afterward i i realized wait

599.2 --> 605.6
i forgot this sambal

601.839 --> 607.2790000000001
i actually forgot like all of the spices

605.6 --> 609.12
so i'm gonna mix that in afterwards

607.279 --> 610.959
because yeah that that makes it like

609.12 --> 613.04
extra nice

610.959 --> 616.8
i put a lot of it in there make it

613.04 --> 616.8
really hot vegetable chicken

616.959 --> 625.76
meal so yeah i had a good bowl of that

622.24 --> 625.76
and it did make quite an impact

625.92 --> 630.56
but in the morning i like i really feel

628.72 --> 632.64
like whoa i absorbed a whole lot of

630.56 --> 634.8
things

632.64 --> 637.36
because in recent week i've pretty much

634.8 --> 640.16
been living on french fries and

637.36 --> 640.16
baked eggs

641.36 --> 645.519
and

642.64 --> 648.079
maybe like chicken soup or well i do get

645.519 --> 649.44
like spaghetti but it's still i i kind

648.079 --> 651.4399999999999
of cheat

649.44 --> 653.7600000000001
i take pre

651.44 --> 657.7600000000001
prepackaged sauce

653.76 --> 661.76
vegetarian one or vegan one

657.76 --> 663.68
then i add in some garlic and basil

661.76 --> 665.68
and i make that with spelt spaghetti but

663.68 --> 667.4399999999999
yeah it i don't me it's not my own

665.68 --> 671.1999999999999
spaghetti

667.44 --> 671.2
but it's it's quick it's easy

673.68 --> 677.92
bok choy

675.279 --> 677.92
okay is that

681.12 --> 684.9590000000001
i assumed it would be the same

687.36 --> 692.48
yeah all right it is pak soy in dutch

690.16 --> 695.76
and bok choy

692.48 --> 695.76
in english okay

699.2 --> 704.32
right well in in such meals it works out

702.0 --> 704.32
great

712.079 --> 714.7199999999999
baked eggs

715.519 --> 720.079
just

717.839 --> 722.8800000000001
you know bit of butter

720.079 --> 722.88
put an egg in it

724.399 --> 729.6
all right it's not baked

726.639 --> 732.399
oh god it's there's like a word

729.6 --> 734.24
application rotation thing

732.399 --> 736.959
happening i think

734.24 --> 736.9590000000001
i guess it's just

740.0 --> 743.32
hold on

748.8 --> 755.88
fry well you call that fried

751.839 --> 755.8800000000001
right it's fried eggs

758.639 --> 762.399
yeah there is a word rotation going on

760.56 --> 765.68
there with the dutch in the english very

762.399 --> 768.079
confusing not scrambled no i just break

765.68 --> 770.079
it open put it in the butter

768.079 --> 772.399
preheated butter

770.079 --> 774.8
salt pepper

772.399 --> 777.68
and then afterwards

774.8 --> 780.4799999999999
i put a decent amount of mayonnaise on

777.68 --> 780.4799999999999
there as well

782.48 --> 786.5600000000001
right this stir-frying kind of works i

784.72 --> 790.32
guess too

786.56 --> 790.3199999999999
i just prefer it just like that

794.399 --> 801.839
batch of chicken feed ya fijitas

799.12 --> 801.839
what

802.72 --> 805.12
okay

807.76 --> 810.639
nice

808.639 --> 813.279
anyway

810.639 --> 815.92
yeah i've been living on that very basic

813.279 --> 817.92
food for quite a while

815.92 --> 822.079
and i guess that also because of

817.92 --> 822.079
supplements i take it it kind of works

822.8 --> 830.24
but i do tend to skip out on vegetables

825.92 --> 830.24
more than i should and i like i

830.72 --> 834.48
right

832.24 --> 838.48
so it's important to get to really do

834.48 --> 838.48
some serious cooking every now and then

838.56 --> 843.199
and not just

840.32 --> 845.6
quick and easy meals

843.199 --> 850.199
i mean i have all the time

845.6 --> 850.1990000000001
to do it i just need to do it

860.24 --> 863.519
all right

861.04 --> 865.4399999999999
like in a unit with multiple people it

863.519 --> 868.399
works much better for me

865.44 --> 869.9200000000001
like when it was with my ex

868.399 --> 873.199
because then you have to cook for other

869.92 --> 874.079
people and there is like

873.199 --> 877.199
the

874.079 --> 878.4799999999999
cost barrier is not such such a problem

877.199 --> 880.24
and you're not gonna be like oh i'm

878.48 --> 882.24
gonna make this big meal there's pretty

880.24 --> 884.88
much only one way to do it and if you do

882.24 --> 888.639
it you have to eat that

884.88 --> 891.92
for like half or half a week or more

888.639 --> 894.639
and that becomes annoying and you don't

891.92 --> 896.8389999999999
want yeah like oh i'll just put it back

894.639 --> 898.72
in the freezer or something now

896.839 --> 902.8000000000001
that's

898.72 --> 902.8000000000001
i try to avoid that as much as possible

903.12 --> 907.279
because

904.079 --> 909.68
i just don't like that

907.279 --> 909.68
anyway

909.839 --> 912.839
food

917.6 --> 921.6800000000001
all right

919.199 --> 923.5999999999999
but i do like cooking in a unit

921.68 --> 925.4399999999999
especially because i'm good at cooking

923.6 --> 928.24
and when you're good at cooking you get

925.44 --> 932.32
appreciation for it

928.24 --> 932.32
and that makes it very much worth it

933.279 --> 938.48
like my ex was very happy with my

935.68 --> 941.8389999999999
cooking she couldn't cook for [ __ ] well

938.48 --> 941.839
she did get a little better though

943.6 --> 946.16
like

944.48 --> 948.399
because

946.16 --> 950.639
the issue with me is i typically make

948.399 --> 952.839
the same meals i'm not like this guy

950.639 --> 955.36
it's like oh i'm going to try this

952.839 --> 957.759
recipe and

955.36 --> 959.6
a lot of women are kind of like that so

957.759 --> 963.279
she did end up like oh i'm gonna try

959.6 --> 963.279
this and i was like okay sure

964.16 --> 969.36
my mother also did that i don't really

966.639 --> 971.6800000000001
like doing that i'd like to make like

969.36 --> 974.24
complete meals where i know it's gonna

971.68 --> 974.2399999999999
be good

976.16 --> 981.16
and she was very appreciative of it

992.0 --> 995.8
boring uh

996.48 --> 999.519
okay take five

1005.28 --> 1008.3199999999999
[Music]

1009.199 --> 1011.8389999999999
hmm

1014.48 --> 1017.6800000000001
right pj crew shank

1018.0 --> 1020.88
what was the kid is always doing yeah

1019.68 --> 1022.8389999999999
but

1020.88 --> 1025.6
that's it you

1022.839 --> 1027.52
know when there's like little kids

1025.6 --> 1030.24
involved

1027.52 --> 1031.679
you kind of gotta adapt your cooking a

1030.24 --> 1034.319
bit

1031.679 --> 1037.2800000000002
and women for some reason

1034.319 --> 1040.079
are always very good at that

1037.28 --> 1041.12
but when everybody is

1040.079 --> 1042.799
like

1041.12 --> 1045.36
yeah starting to reach adulthood like

1042.799 --> 1046.959
after 12 then

1045.36 --> 1048.3999999999999
i guess

1046.959 --> 1052.6000000000001
yeah

1048.4 --> 1052.6000000000001
the men kind of take over

1053.6 --> 1060.1599999999999
at home when yeah when i was young my

1057.039 --> 1060.16
dad did all the cooking

1062.96 --> 1067.52
like he was he still is a really good

1065.6 --> 1070.08
cook

1067.52 --> 1072.24
and like very adaptable

1070.08 --> 1074.6399999999999
like he he now cooks

1072.24 --> 1077.919
like tinker tailored to like the diet

1074.64 --> 1080.48
needs of my stepmom

1077.919 --> 1081.8400000000001
who is like super low

1080.48 --> 1084.64
salt

1081.84 --> 1087.1999999999998
and some other issues

1084.64 --> 1088.72
like not like super problematic or

1087.2 --> 1091.52
anything but

1088.72 --> 1093.28
and he's like well he does it perfectly

1091.52 --> 1094.48
but it's weird because he cooks very

1093.28 --> 1098.08
different

1094.48 --> 1098.08
now than compared to

1100.0 --> 1106.36
yeah when i was younger

1103.36 --> 1106.36
anyway

1108.32 --> 1111.9189999999999
if it's just for yourself you can

1110.64 --> 1115.3600000000001
experiment

1111.919 --> 1115.3600000000001
yeah well if you're okay with that

1119.52 --> 1123.9189999999999
in the past i have kind of experiment or

1122.799 --> 1127.12
tried it

1123.919 --> 1130.0800000000002
experimenting with cooking but

1127.12 --> 1131.36
you know when it goes wrong

1130.08 --> 1134.799
that's like

1131.36 --> 1134.799
that really sucks

1137.039 --> 1143.0
because then you got to eat

1139.2 --> 1143.0
yeah a failed meal

1151.76 --> 1157.28
or you gotta have some backup thing

1154.48 --> 1159.84
but if you then have to make all of that

1157.28 --> 1161.76
while you just spend a lot of time

1159.84 --> 1163.4399999999998
making dinner

1161.76 --> 1164.4
then you're gonna be hungry it's very

1163.44 --> 1165.76
annoying

1164.4 --> 1169.2
anyway

1165.76 --> 1173.48
i'm not a big fan of experimentation

1169.2 --> 1173.48
with cooking i'm just not

1184.24 --> 1189.72
my mom cooked regularly because that was

1186.32 --> 1189.72
work right

1200.799 --> 1205.52
you were wondering about only paying

1203.039 --> 1207.84
heed to jesus words in the bible your

1205.52 --> 1207.84
thoughts

1208.24 --> 1211.76
well

1209.679 --> 1214.0
i wouldn't put everything else on white

1211.76 --> 1215.84
noise

1214.0 --> 1218.0
you know

1215.84 --> 1218.0
like

1219.44 --> 1223.8400000000001
in a way the whole point of it is to

1222.08 --> 1226.24
figure it out

1223.84 --> 1228.48
it's just that i've

1226.24 --> 1230.88
so far found that

1228.48 --> 1233.28
pretty much every step of my personal

1230.88 --> 1236.5590000000002
development journey of understanding

1233.28 --> 1237.84
it's always jesus that

1236.559 --> 1239.84
that seems

1237.84 --> 1242.1589999999999
it seems

1239.84 --> 1244.24
turns out to be i think rather

1242.159 --> 1246.96
infallible

1244.24 --> 1249.76
and yeah

1246.96 --> 1254.08
but to only pay heed to jesus words no

1249.76 --> 1254.08
but definitely pay attention

1256.0 --> 1262.919
because there are existential

1258.08 --> 1262.9189999999999
implications and there is like

1264.96 --> 1270.48
meanings that like you don't necessarily

1268.08 --> 1272.559
see yet at the beginning

1270.48 --> 1275.1200000000001
right it's like very fractal

1272.559 --> 1276.96
applications i in my own way tried to do

1275.12 --> 1279.12
it like that as well

1276.96 --> 1279.919
but it's

1279.12 --> 1281.12
a

1279.919 --> 1282.64
poor

1281.12 --> 1284.799
attempt

1282.64 --> 1288.48
in my opinion compared to jesus although

1284.799 --> 1288.48
this is a completely different age

1288.799 --> 1295.039
but i think that to just understand what

1291.919 --> 1297.679
he was doing is already like a real big

1295.039 --> 1302.2
advantage

1297.679 --> 1302.2
a blessing from god if you will

1311.2 --> 1316.48
oh moon shadow

1313.679 --> 1317.44
should we no

1316.48 --> 1319.3600000000001
no you

1317.44 --> 1322.159
reject it all depends on what you're

1319.36 --> 1322.1589999999999
gonna do with it

1323.679 --> 1327.2800000000002
why would you scratch out the rest of

1325.6 --> 1330.4399999999998
the bible

1327.28 --> 1330.44
you know

1332.08 --> 1337.9189999999999
it's just that in my

1334.559 --> 1341.36
personal experience and opinion

1337.919 --> 1344.0
like if you have to choose

1341.36 --> 1345.52
between jesus

1344.0 --> 1347.44
insights

1345.52 --> 1348.799
which are existential

1347.44 --> 1351.1200000000001
and another

1348.799 --> 1353.679
situation happening in the bible with

1351.12 --> 1355.4399999999998
some apostles opinion or

1353.679 --> 1358.3200000000002
something

1355.44 --> 1359.1200000000001
yeah if that seems to contradict then i

1358.32 --> 1362.1589999999999
would

1359.12 --> 1366.8799999999999
figure out how

1362.159 --> 1366.88
and basically end up choosing jesus

1367.2 --> 1371.52
it's really funny it's like okay yeah

1369.919 --> 1374.64
you might weigh it off and then i'm like

1371.52 --> 1376.799
yeah but the situation you know

1374.64 --> 1379.1200000000001
and then you choose that

1376.799 --> 1380.559
but then much later when you reflect on

1379.12 --> 1383.6
it again it's like

1380.559 --> 1386.799
yeah i get that

1383.6 --> 1388.48
but overall jesus was right after all

1386.799 --> 1393.039
it's

1388.48 --> 1393.039
these are complicated esoterics

1401.679 --> 1404.72
hey tell you and cat

1406.0 --> 1410.64
if you disregard well right if you

1408.08 --> 1412.559
disregard everything but the red letters

1410.64 --> 1416.0800000000002
well then how

1412.559 --> 1418.799
then you're kind of missing the point

1416.08 --> 1420.96
because it is all about comparing it

1418.799 --> 1422.799
and then judging

1420.96 --> 1427.159
that's part of the point that's part of

1422.799 --> 1427.1589999999999
the thing that the learning process

1432.159 --> 1435.6000000000001
but

1432.96 --> 1436.48
to prioritize the red letters i don't

1435.6 --> 1439.1999999999998
see

1436.48 --> 1440.88
how that would make me lost

1439.2 --> 1443.1200000000001
if that is what you're implying chao

1440.88 --> 1445.44
young cat

1443.12 --> 1449.7199999999998
but maybe you were just

1445.44 --> 1449.72
addressing sicarius there

1462.559 --> 1466.8799999999999
right

1463.6 --> 1467.76
don't reject the rest of the bible well

1466.88 --> 1470.159
that's

1467.76 --> 1472.4
not what i'm saying right there could be

1470.159 --> 1474.5590000000002
situations where you could basically

1472.4 --> 1476.72
point at it say like yeah i get what's

1474.559 --> 1479.2
happening there

1476.72 --> 1480.32
but there are problems

1479.2 --> 1482.88
there's like

1480.32 --> 1485.4399999999998
he got to this level

1482.88 --> 1487.7600000000002
in the spectrum of things

1485.44 --> 1489.76
whatever person

1487.76 --> 1492.4
like even if

1489.76 --> 1492.4
they were like

1494.64 --> 1498.919
from the old testament for example

1501.6 --> 1504.6
oh

1514.4 --> 1519.44
the gospel that saves you isn't one

1517.039 --> 1521.2
you'll find in the red

1519.44 --> 1524.72
oh

1521.2 --> 1524.72
oh well there there you go

1525.84 --> 1532.1589999999999
so you're literally saying

1529.12 --> 1535.039
the gospel that saves you is not in the

1532.159 --> 1537.8400000000001
red letter so the gospel is not

1535.039 --> 1537.84
jesus then

1538.32 --> 1543.039
that's a profound statement

1541.36 --> 1546.6
very revealing

1543.039 --> 1546.6
ciao yoon cat

1559.679 --> 1561.919
yeah

1562.559 --> 1567.72
hello cleary oh wait already here

1571.96 --> 1575.1190000000001
[Music]

1578.63 --> 1581.8190000000002
[Music]

1600.159 --> 1602.48
right

1606.0 --> 1612.08
right that's interesting sicarious but

1609.039 --> 1613.2
what does that mean

1612.08 --> 1615.4399999999998
i think

1613.2 --> 1618.32
that perfectly reflects everything that

1615.44 --> 1619.1200000000001
i was just saying

1618.32 --> 1624.0
right

1619.12 --> 1624.0
i'm just laying some priorities here

1624.799 --> 1630.8799999999999
because jesus says yeah

1627.84 --> 1632.8799999999999
you and what you bring

1630.88 --> 1634.5590000000002
the connection

1632.88 --> 1636.48
we have

1634.559 --> 1637.52
is part

1636.48 --> 1640.24
of

1637.52 --> 1644.559
the legacy

1640.24 --> 1644.559
right if you outright reject them

1644.799 --> 1647.12
then

1647.6 --> 1654.1999999999998
you're gonna miss a part you're gonna

1649.679 --> 1654.2
miss a part of what's going on

1662.96 --> 1665.2
see

1665.6 --> 1669.1589999999999
it's all context

1680.24 --> 1686.0
yeah yeah ciao young cat hey hey hey hey

1683.6 --> 1689.24
yeah that's not a quote from jesus now

1686.0 --> 1689.24
is it

1699.679 --> 1703.279
yeah

1701.2 --> 1705.679
no no no

1703.279 --> 1708.48
i'm i will reject that

1705.679 --> 1710.48
it's illogical

1708.48 --> 1714.32
besides jesus

1710.48 --> 1717.039
very very clearly has never said he was

1714.32 --> 1717.039
going to die

1720.96 --> 1725.08
he's done that for a reason

1739.919 --> 1744.3200000000002
now you're going to keep repeating

1741.279 --> 1744.32
yourselves carius

1744.47 --> 1747.729
[Music]

1748.799 --> 1753.12
am i saying not to pay attention to the

1751.6 --> 1755.279
rest of the book

1753.12 --> 1757.9189999999999
why are you chanting why are you

1755.279 --> 1761.76
projecting your straw man version of

1757.919 --> 1763.76
what you think i'm doing onto me

1761.76 --> 1766.48
why are you

1763.76 --> 1769.44
neglecting to listen

1766.48 --> 1771.84
neglecting to listen

1769.44 --> 1774.88
to my declarations to

1771.84 --> 1774.8799999999999
how i view it

1774.96 --> 1781.48
and why are you then strawmanning

1777.84 --> 1781.48
me with that misunderstanding

1786.159 --> 1791.7990000000002
yeah why are you reposting it then i

1788.32 --> 1791.799
addressed it

1794.08 --> 1798.96
you think i'm lying

1796.08 --> 1801.9189999999999
sicarius you think i'm lying

1798.96 --> 1801.919
about what i've said

1802.24 --> 1806.0
that you need to repeat it

1806.399 --> 1810.799
right because that would be chanting

1811.12 --> 1816.1999999999998
ignoring me saying the same thing over

1813.2 --> 1816.2
again

1828.399 --> 1833.8799999999999
no

1830.559 --> 1833.8799999999999
of course

1841.679 --> 1847.64
isn't the bible like a diary well in in

1844.24 --> 1847.64
sort of way

1863.76 --> 1865.84
you

1885.36 --> 1890.36
then truth must be in the bible yes

1899.279 --> 1903.679
right yeah but surface day the thing

1901.039 --> 1905.44
about a diary is

1903.679 --> 1906.64
if you think about it you know this is

1905.44 --> 1908.72
true

1906.64 --> 1910.48
when you write a diary

1908.72 --> 1913.2
you re write it

1910.48 --> 1916.3990000000001
in that moment in reflection to what

1913.2 --> 1918.0
occupies your mind including trains of

1916.399 --> 1920.559
thinking

1918.0 --> 1923.2
long-term suspicions

1920.559 --> 1925.2
you're going to put down your honest

1923.2 --> 1927.519
opinions and thoughts

1925.2 --> 1929.279
and reflections upon things

1927.519 --> 1932.08
that doesn't mean

1929.279 --> 1934.64
that that's all based on correct trainer

1932.08 --> 1939.279
thinking and assumptions that could

1934.64 --> 1939.279
incorporate mistaken assumptions

1939.76 --> 1944.799
it's still honest

1942.48 --> 1946.64
it's an honest mistake

1944.799 --> 1948.48
it could be an honest mistake that's

1946.64 --> 1951.1200000000001
what i'm saying not

1948.48 --> 1952.32
this is theoretical right this is just

1951.12 --> 1953.9189999999999
like how

1952.32 --> 1956.96
writing down

1953.919 --> 1960.76
journals and all that work

1956.96 --> 1960.76
if you mean it honestly

1964.32 --> 1968.399
not if we stay objectively

1969.519 --> 1973.1200000000001
but how do you know you are

1973.2 --> 1978.799
if nobody basically points that out you

1976.159 --> 1980.64
at you yeah points that out for you

1978.799 --> 1984.559
and maybe if they do maybe you don't

1980.64 --> 1986.5590000000002
understand maybe you just can't

1984.559 --> 1988.799
adapt

1986.559 --> 1991.9189999999999
even if you tried

1988.799 --> 1994.32
and that has been demonstrated to happen

1991.919 --> 1996.48
in jesus presence like

1994.32 --> 2001.72
people were like i helped help me i'm

1996.48 --> 2001.72
trying to understand it it's not working

2010.48 --> 2013.48
so

2031.6 --> 2033.84
hmm

2083.119 --> 2086.119
oh

2094.32 --> 2097.32
huh

2109.2 --> 2114.52
ah cleary you're ignoring chaoyun cat

2111.52 --> 2114.52
now

2122.88 --> 2127.8
but i get i get your trainer thinking

2157.28 --> 2163.0400000000004
all right

2159.68 --> 2164.96
okay secarius yeah sure if that's

2163.04 --> 2166.24
what you want to do with

2164.96 --> 2168.88
the religion

2166.24 --> 2168.8799999999997
that's fine

2169.68 --> 2175.68
but you see i don't have to use icons

2174.16 --> 2178.0789999999997
to focus on

2175.68 --> 2179.5989999999997
like that

2178.079 --> 2182.8390000000004
i just

2179.599 --> 2182.839
do it

2186.0 --> 2192.52
don't have to conjure some icon to

2188.96 --> 2192.52
attain inspiration

2211.44 --> 2215.16
hey andrew yeah

2221.2 --> 2229.48
explain please yeah well these icons

2225.119 --> 2229.48
pray to the holy ghost

2229.76 --> 2233.2000000000003
devotional prayer

2234.16 --> 2240.0
or you could just live

2237.119 --> 2243.6800000000003
and understand

2240.0 --> 2247.359
what it all means and then apply that

2243.68 --> 2249.359
understanding to how you operate

2247.359 --> 2251.2799999999997
reflecting good

2249.359 --> 2252.3199999999997
yeah the good intentions that are part

2251.28 --> 2255.5600000000004
of

2252.32 --> 2255.56
the understanding

2260.24 --> 2265.7599999999998
right the actual physical action

2263.44 --> 2270.2000000000003
in my opinion is not required it is

2265.76 --> 2270.2000000000003
basically a focus ritual

2284.72 --> 2288.24
what i meant with the icon well the holy

2287.119 --> 2292.0
ghost

2288.24 --> 2294.3199999999997
or even a figurine of jesus

2292.0 --> 2296.24
which could like could be statue or in

2294.32 --> 2299.839
your mind

2296.24 --> 2299.839
right it's like oh i'm going to

2300.0 --> 2305.28
specifically pray to what i see as jesus

2304.079 --> 2308.32
or

2305.28 --> 2308.32
the holy ghost

2309.04 --> 2316.32
right those are icons

2311.28 --> 2316.32
those are the ways you for yourself

2316.72 --> 2322.48
mentally address it

2320.4 --> 2324.0
it's what you make for yourself in your

2322.48 --> 2327.839
mind

2324.0 --> 2327.839
to do those actions

2346.85 --> 2349.889
[Music]

2357.359 --> 2361.7599999999998
shouldn't be

2358.8 --> 2366.119
am i saying that sicarius

2361.76 --> 2366.119
why are you straw manning me

2370.48 --> 2375.76
i'm just saying

2372.8 --> 2377.28
i think it's not technically necessary

2375.76 --> 2381.2000000000003
to achieve

2377.28 --> 2381.2000000000003
what you're trying to achieve with that

2381.44 --> 2385.2000000000003
it is like a focus item it is

2384.0 --> 2388.64
a thing

2385.2 --> 2390.16
a traditional format

2388.64 --> 2393.72
to engage

2390.16 --> 2393.72
with those actions

2406.88 --> 2410.599
what andrew

2424.24 --> 2427.24
so

2445.839 --> 2449.599
what

2446.8 --> 2453.8
oppression can lead to depression no

2449.599 --> 2457.059
oppression always leads to depression

2453.8 --> 2457.059
[Music]

2459.92 --> 2462.92
eventually

2501.04 --> 2505.119
oh really

2502.64 --> 2509.839
you're just asking for my opinion then

2505.119 --> 2509.839
why do you format those questions

2511.52 --> 2515.52
with in such a suggestive way

2514.72 --> 2518.3999999999996
what

2515.52 --> 2520.8
would make you think so far that i would

2518.4 --> 2522.56
discourage people from praying and all

2520.8 --> 2527.04
that

2522.56 --> 2527.04
like that part it look

2527.28 --> 2532.1600000000003
i'm constantly being barraged

2530.0 --> 2535.68
even spiritually from people that are

2532.16 --> 2536.8799999999997
stuck into priestly religious formats of

2535.68 --> 2539.7599999999998
thinking

2536.88 --> 2543.76
so i'm very suspicious

2539.76 --> 2543.76
anybody that is interested in this

2544.88 --> 2550.6800000000003
and i thought that your question was

2546.8 --> 2550.6800000000003
very very suggestive

2550.8 --> 2554.96
even though nothing that i explained up

2552.96 --> 2558.48
until that point

2554.96 --> 2561.28
really suggests that i was just saying

2558.48 --> 2564.8
like nah it's not necessary or something

2561.28 --> 2566.2400000000002
that's that how does that mean don't do

2564.8 --> 2571.319
that

2566.24 --> 2571.319
it doesn't it doesn't mean that at all

2588.59 --> 2593.2000000000003
[Music]

2591.28 --> 2595.6800000000003
all right if there's something that i am

2593.2 --> 2598.3999999999996
going to say don't do that

2595.68 --> 2599.359
then i'm going to say don't do that

2598.4 --> 2601.6800000000003
right

2599.359 --> 2603.119
so for example when people start

2601.68 --> 2607.2799999999997
chanting

2603.119 --> 2609.6800000000003
oh jesus died for our sins

2607.28 --> 2612.1600000000003
very popular chant

2609.68 --> 2612.96
by people that are very energetic about

2612.16 --> 2615.5989999999997
that

2612.96 --> 2616.8
yeah then i'm gonna say yeah that's

2615.599 --> 2619.92
wrong

2616.8 --> 2621.119
that's bad and i can explain why it's

2619.92 --> 2623.2000000000003
bad

2621.119 --> 2625.6800000000003
i don't typically like to slap people in

2623.2 --> 2628.8799999999997
the faces with that but i do think it's

2625.68 --> 2632.52
necessary because it's a slumber

2628.88 --> 2632.52
it's a bad slumber

2641.119 --> 2645.8
it's a very dark thing to say

2655.839 --> 2661.2
and especially to hold it up as such an

2658.96 --> 2664.319
important key

2661.2 --> 2665.68
that part especially is very dark about

2664.319 --> 2667.7599999999998
it

2665.68 --> 2671.1189999999997
like to put a

2667.76 --> 2671.119
human sacrifice

2671.839 --> 2677.44
at as the utmost important

2675.44 --> 2678.7200000000003
for you to be

2677.44 --> 2681.52
released

2678.72 --> 2681.52
from sin

2682.4 --> 2688.839
as i said before i cannot think of a a

2685.44 --> 2692.7200000000003
single thing that is more satanic than

2688.839 --> 2697.64
that it is so inside out reasoning

2692.72 --> 2697.64
with everything known and clarified

2726.96 --> 2733.2
are you still on with that sicarius

2730.48 --> 2735.68
look i already clarified yeah i thought

2733.2 --> 2738.72
that yours your question was suggestive

2735.68 --> 2738.72
and nothing i had said

2739.359 --> 2744.24
would lead me

2741.599 --> 2747.839
from an ignorant standpoint to ask such

2744.24 --> 2749.9199999999996
a question in that setting

2747.839 --> 2751.2
it makes me from the other side the

2749.92 --> 2754.8
actual me

2751.2 --> 2756.0789999999997
feel like you're trying to trick me

2754.8 --> 2759.6800000000003
yeah

2756.079 --> 2761.76
i don't need a whole bunch of excuse

2759.68 --> 2765.68
texts

2761.76 --> 2765.6800000000003
about it it's just what it is

2767.92 --> 2772.48
i need to stop well maybe you need to

2770.319 --> 2774.88
stop making demands

2772.48 --> 2777.839
how about that sicarius

2774.88 --> 2780.079
you're you're a guest in my chat here on

2777.839 --> 2782.0
this live show

2780.079 --> 2784.6400000000003
and i am addressing you

2782.0 --> 2788.319
elaborately maybe you need to just stop

2784.64 --> 2792.0789999999997
being so high and mighty

2788.319 --> 2792.079
and just get over what i said

2792.56 --> 2796.24
that's very ironic because in a way

2794.56 --> 2800.16
that's kind of what you're trying to

2796.24 --> 2803.839
tell me well i am over what you said

2800.16 --> 2803.839
you don't seem to be

2828.64 --> 2832.48
can we agree asking a question isn't

2830.88 --> 2834.1600000000003
stating opinion

2832.48 --> 2836.16
no

2834.16 --> 2837.7599999999998
no we can't

2836.16 --> 2840.72
because it all depends on how you're

2837.76 --> 2842.079
going to ask the question

2840.72 --> 2844.8799999999997
again

2842.079 --> 2846.48
questions can be formulated it's a

2844.88 --> 2850.2400000000002
political art

2846.48 --> 2851.44
in such ways that certain things are

2850.24 --> 2854.64
hinted at

2851.44 --> 2857.28
innuendo is what that's called

2854.64 --> 2858.96
right so yeah i'm not going to straight

2857.28 --> 2861.8390000000004
out agree

2858.96 --> 2864.319
on that question asking

2861.839 --> 2866.319
is not stating an opinion

2864.319 --> 2868.24
because it can be it all depends on how

2866.319 --> 2870.16
you're going to ask the question

2868.24 --> 2873.5589999999997
what are you going to suggest

2870.16 --> 2873.5589999999997
with the question

2879.32 --> 2882.4390000000003
[Music]

2885.46 --> 2891.78
[Music]

2901.92 --> 2904.92
hey

2917.119 --> 2922.88
oh you're gonna ask demands

2920.079 --> 2924.1600000000003
well how about

2922.88 --> 2926.48
no

2924.16 --> 2929.839
how about you stop making demands or i

2926.48 --> 2929.839
ban you how about that

2933.2 --> 2939.2
look if you have any questions just ask

2935.359 --> 2939.2
them but be mindful

2941.44 --> 2946.2400000000002
i don't like to be framed

2944.16 --> 2949.5989999999997
to be some kind of anti-christian

2946.24 --> 2949.5989999999997
heretic do you understand

2949.76 --> 2954.96
and you can say

2952.079 --> 2958.8
that's not what you're doing here

2954.96 --> 2960.64
but i don't have any guarantees of that

2958.8 --> 2963.92
especially if you're going to ask very

2960.64 --> 2963.92
suggestive questions

2964.24 --> 2969.4399999999996
so hey you have any questions ask them

2968.319 --> 2972.839
if not

2969.44 --> 2972.839
stop complaining

2979.62 --> 2982.65
[Music]

2990.8 --> 2995.76
oh man time has flown

2993.44 --> 2998.96
it's been interesting though you know i

2995.76 --> 3001.3590000000004
do appreciate attempts

2998.96 --> 3003.359
of inquiry especially in this very

3001.359 --> 3007.0789999999997
complicated subject

3003.359 --> 3007.0789999999997
we know as bible

3038.079 --> 3043.119
what

3039.119 --> 3043.119
are you asking me that gaining wisdom

3049.359 --> 3055.7599999999998
oh you mean what is jesus's supposed

3051.76 --> 3060.079
real name jehoshawa or was it

3055.76 --> 3063.2000000000003
yeah something like that i'd look i know

3060.079 --> 3064.8
jesus is basically the modernization of

3063.2 --> 3067.7599999999998
his name

3064.8 --> 3069.04
and at it there is even more complicated

3067.76 --> 3071.3590000000004
issues

3069.04 --> 3075.52
i just don't want to over complicate

3071.359 --> 3075.52
things even though i understand

3078.319 --> 3083.839
i just don't

3079.68 --> 3083.839
like i'm more focused on

3084.079 --> 3091.599
spirit and meaning and understanding

3088.48 --> 3094.319
and then like how you exactly pronounce

3091.599 --> 3094.319
something or

3094.839 --> 3099.119
like those types of details

3097.839 --> 3102.64
they don't

3099.119 --> 3106.04
i don't feel they really matter

3102.64 --> 3106.04
not to me

3130.24 --> 3135.7599999999998
are you kidding me slow mo movie you

3132.16 --> 3138.7599999999998
think sean goes to church

3135.76 --> 3138.76
no

3145.68 --> 3148.7999999999997
dude

3146.88 --> 3151.44
at this point if sean walks into a

3148.8 --> 3154.8
church he'd catch fire if he wasn't

3151.44 --> 3154.8
mentally prepared for it

3163.359 --> 3167.839
i know it's a joke i made a follow-up

3165.599 --> 3167.839
joke

3168.72 --> 3172.359
of course it's a joke

3189.2 --> 3195.319
what

3191.44 --> 3195.319
what are you saying there cecarius

3203.2 --> 3206.319
his name is jesus

3206.4 --> 3211.599
right yep dude that's fine with me but

3209.119 --> 3213.92
just realize that

3211.599 --> 3217.839
the bible is like a

3213.92 --> 3219.04
a three-step translation as well

3217.839 --> 3223.0
so

3219.04 --> 3223.0
and then there's more complications

3223.119 --> 3226.1600000000003
to be fair

3225.119 --> 3228.4
in a

3226.16 --> 3231.5989999999997
worldly mechanical sense i'm not even

3228.4 --> 3234.88
sure that any of it actually literally

3231.599 --> 3238.48
happened like this or if it was a

3234.88 --> 3239.6800000000003
a play about somebody that actually

3238.48 --> 3241.76
existed

3239.68 --> 3243.44
and that there is that it's made to be

3241.76 --> 3247.92
super similar

3243.44 --> 3247.92
made in the shadow of the actual event

3248.48 --> 3254.72
and i do believe that in in that

3251.68 --> 3257.9199999999996
approach the character of jesus

3254.72 --> 3260.72
was the central figure

3257.92 --> 3263.599
and that his words are based on what the

3260.72 --> 3264.64
real world person had actually been

3263.599 --> 3266.7200000000003
saying

3264.64 --> 3269.2799999999997
with the contacts and the

3266.72 --> 3270.0789999999997
and the parables and everything

3269.28 --> 3272.6400000000003
right

3270.079 --> 3275.2000000000003
that they rewrote it

3272.64 --> 3276.8799999999997
i have a suspicion about that

3275.2 --> 3277.839
and

3276.88 --> 3280.48
that

3277.839 --> 3282.4
doesn't matter to me

3280.48 --> 3284.16
it's not important to me

3282.4 --> 3286.799
the only thing that's important is what

3284.16 --> 3289.2799999999997
you can learn

3286.799 --> 3293.2
from it

3289.28 --> 3296.7200000000003
because the message of jesus whoever he

3293.2 --> 3298.96
originally was is real

3296.72 --> 3301.1189999999997
is very powerful is

3298.96 --> 3303.44
fractal in nature and the more you

3301.119 --> 3306.44
ascend the more you realize that about

3303.44 --> 3306.44
it

3312.06 --> 3315.159
[Music]

3333.599 --> 3336.599
eh

3359.2 --> 3363.839
well how pg christian how do you know

3361.2 --> 3366.319
that he called himself the son of man

3363.839 --> 3368.88
did he literally say oh yeah when i say

3366.319 --> 3372.4
the son of man guys

3368.88 --> 3374.0
i'm actually talking about me jesus did

3372.4 --> 3376.799
he ever say that

3374.0 --> 3378.96
or is that just simply assumed

3376.799 --> 3381.04
i think he when he does that he is

3378.96 --> 3384.16
basically

3381.04 --> 3384.16
prophecy talking

3384.72 --> 3389.7599999999998
he's talking about the awakening

3387.599 --> 3392.88
that will be echoed into the future

3389.76 --> 3392.88
because that is what it does

3393.599 --> 3398.1600000000003
it's complicated it's very

3397.04 --> 3403.24
very

3398.16 --> 3403.24
heavy esoterics what he is doing

3416.96 --> 3421.68
okay it seems like

3418.96 --> 3425.0
cicarius is dropping off or it's just

3421.68 --> 3425.0
reading up

3435.599 --> 3439.2000000000003
yes jesus called himself the son of man

3437.44 --> 3441.04
oh really where

3439.2 --> 3445.5589999999997
can you point me at the red letters

3441.04 --> 3445.5589999999997
where he literally says that

3447.359 --> 3450.359
cigarious

3488.16 --> 3490.3999999999996
see

3491.359 --> 3496.64
well unless you're now

3493.359 --> 3496.64
finding that quote

3499.28 --> 3503.76
i just caught you chanting didn't i it's

3502.079 --> 3506.2400000000002
like yeah jesus called himself the son

3503.76 --> 3509.0400000000004
of man oh really or is that what the

3506.24 --> 3509.04
priesthood

3509.119 --> 3513.04
that has been

3510.72 --> 3513.839
holding the bible

3513.04 --> 3517.04
for

3513.839 --> 3518.5589999999997
a millennia is that what they

3517.04 --> 3521.119
say

3518.559 --> 3521.119
it means

3521.92 --> 3527.359
right

3524.079 --> 3528.799
matthew 18 i don't know but

3527.359 --> 3533.359
i don't know that by heart peter

3528.799 --> 3538.599
grushank i'm just asking where

3533.359 --> 3538.5989999999997
can i can you post it or is it too big

3592.4 --> 3597.28
oh well ciao young cat you can't exclude

3595.28 --> 3599.52
that

3597.28 --> 3603.119
just because one thing you said is true

3599.52 --> 3603.119
doesn't make the other not true

3603.92 --> 3609.96
if it mechanically works it

3606.24 --> 3609.9599999999996
mechanically works

3620.079 --> 3624.559
for the son of man has come to say that

3622.72 --> 3625.359
which is lost

3624.559 --> 3626.4
oh

3625.359 --> 3629.44
what

3626.4 --> 3629.44
what pj christian

3632.319 --> 3638.48
i asked for where he specifically

3635.28 --> 3641.599
clarified i when i say the son of man

3638.48 --> 3642.559
i'm talking about me jesus

3641.599 --> 3644.079
this

3642.559 --> 3646.1600000000003
sounds like

3644.079 --> 3648.1600000000003
the first time he starts bringing up the

3646.16 --> 3653.799
son of man

3648.16 --> 3653.799
and then parabolically introduces it

3665.119 --> 3671.52
oh god i was right again

3668.72 --> 3673.9199999999996
it sucks it sucks

3671.52 --> 3675.119
when i don't actually know

3673.92 --> 3677.6800000000003
for sure

3675.119 --> 3680.2400000000002
yet i turn out to be right it happened

3677.68 --> 3682.24
so many times because i'm just

3680.24 --> 3684.4799999999996
reconstructing what has really happened

3682.24 --> 3687.839
based on patterns of response

3684.48 --> 3687.839
and i get it right

3687.92 --> 3692.839
it's like

3689.839 --> 3692.839
crazy

3710.16 --> 3715.5989999999997
yeah i sometimes feel like i'm like a

3712.48 --> 3717.92
lore master in d and d terminologies

3715.599 --> 3720.079
i specifically designed lore masters to

3717.92 --> 3722.2400000000002
be like masters of reading and

3720.079 --> 3725.28
understanding books to the point where

3722.24 --> 3728.319
they can literally touch a book and just

3725.28 --> 3728.3190000000004
instantly read it

3730.48 --> 3735.599
that could also be interpreted as they

3732.96 --> 3738.319
don't read it they just immediately

3735.599 --> 3738.319
understand it

3739.119 --> 3743.76
like they tap into

3740.88 --> 3746.48
the spirit that has wrote it and then

3743.76 --> 3749.6800000000003
like telepathically extract all the

3746.48 --> 3751.28
actual original spark information that

3749.68 --> 3752.839
has created it

3751.28 --> 3755.92
anyway

3752.839 --> 3758.88
uh right oh that's

3755.92 --> 3762.0
yeah nice sicarius that's great i don't

3758.88 --> 3764.2400000000002
know what that is

3762.0 --> 3765.44
you're gonna have to actually spell it

3764.24 --> 3768.64
out

3765.44 --> 3773.7200000000003
i'm really bad at looking up

3768.64 --> 3773.72
things in the bible just by that system

3785.2 --> 3788.3999999999996
oh my god

3786.88 --> 3790.559
again

3788.4 --> 3793.119
yeah well there you go again it's the

3790.559 --> 3793.119
same thing

3793.599 --> 3796.96
so that's the first mention of the son

3795.68 --> 3799.2799999999997
of man

3796.96 --> 3799.28
oh

3799.44 --> 3804.48
it's not an instruction though it

3801.359 --> 3806.88
doesn't say oh hey guys i'm gonna start

3804.48 --> 3808.319
like talking about the son of man now

3806.88 --> 3811.839
when i do that

3808.319 --> 3811.839
i'm actually talking about me

3813.039 --> 3818.48
that's not what i'm reading right there

3815.039 --> 3818.48
sicarius again

3823.68 --> 3826.5589999999997
right

3824.88 --> 3828.079
so you could consider that moment where

3826.559 --> 3829.6800000000003
he starts to bring it up that's the

3828.079 --> 3833.28
first point where you start to

3829.68 --> 3835.9199999999996
presuppose he's talking about himself

3833.28 --> 3837.2000000000003
because of the similarities

3835.92 --> 3838.559
or

3837.2 --> 3840.64
instead of doing that you could

3838.559 --> 3842.6400000000003
recognize that's when he starts to do

3840.64 --> 3845.2
his parable thing

3842.64 --> 3846.96
and it can

3845.2 --> 3849.4399999999996
apply to him

3846.96 --> 3851.76
but doesn't necessarily have to because

3849.44 --> 3853.039
it's like a fractal

3851.76 --> 3854.96
thing

3853.039 --> 3856.88
he's doing

3854.96 --> 3859.599
he's talking about existential

3856.88 --> 3859.599
implications

3863.52 --> 3867.839
oh here we go again security yes jesus

3865.76 --> 3870.6400000000003
referred to himself as the son of man so

3867.839 --> 3871.92
where does he say that then

3870.64 --> 3875.92
you keep on

3871.92 --> 3875.92
doing the same thing over and over again

3876.48 --> 3882.16
and jesus answered them saying the hour

3879.68 --> 3884.8799999999997
has come that the son of man should be

3882.16 --> 3887.0389999999998
glorified oh

3884.88 --> 3891.599
so did somebody in response to that ask

3887.039 --> 3891.599
him jesus who is this son a man

3891.76 --> 3896.6400000000003
no they didn't

3893.599 --> 3899.839
everybody just is conditioned to start

3896.64 --> 3903.92
believing and that's when jesus starts

3899.839 --> 3906.799
to talk about himself as the son of man

3903.92 --> 3908.7200000000003
nobody actually bothered to ask him in

3906.799 --> 3910.72
this story

3908.72 --> 3913.2799999999997
right

3910.72 --> 3915.52
so that he never really confirmed it

3913.28 --> 3917.119
it's just where you start assuming

3915.52 --> 3918.559
that's what he's talking about because

3917.119 --> 3922.799
that's what the priesthood has been

3918.559 --> 3926.2000000000003
chanting for a thousand years isn't it

3922.799 --> 3926.2
isn't it

3949.76 --> 3954.7200000000003
oh yeah thanks i know yeah that's that's

3952.319 --> 3957.0389999999998
cool that you're emphasizing when he

3954.72 --> 3957.839
actually says it the hours come the son

3957.039 --> 3960.96
of man

3957.839 --> 3962.839
should should be glorified that's cool

3960.96 --> 3965.44
so that's the first mention when he

3962.839 --> 3966.48
mentions the son of man that's really

3965.44 --> 3969.599
awesome

3966.48 --> 3973.359
so where does he specify that he is

3969.599 --> 3974.96
actually talking about himself

3973.359 --> 3977.2
psegarius

3974.96 --> 3980.2400000000002
where is that addressed

3977.2 --> 3982.319
everybody just starts to like oh oh yeah

3980.24 --> 3985.2
of course he's talking about himself why

3982.319 --> 3985.2
wouldn't we ask

3986.799 --> 3991.599
maybe they did ask and he was scrapped

3988.88 --> 3995.119
from the notes because jesus said like

3991.599 --> 3995.119
uh no just listen

3998.079 --> 4002.48
right could imagine that in his fractal

4000.559 --> 4004.48
speaking that is how he might have

4002.48 --> 4007.44
replied it's like no i'm not going to be

4004.48 --> 4009.52
specific this is fractal talking

4007.44 --> 4011.359
this is my parables

4009.52 --> 4013.599
this is where things get really

4011.359 --> 4016.48
complicated you'll understand more about

4013.599 --> 4016.48
it in the future

4017.68 --> 4020.839
you know

4022.16 --> 4028.24
who else could it be well isn't that

4024.88 --> 4030.88
just begging the question

4028.24 --> 4031.839
i mean is it it is a fallacy though it's

4030.88 --> 4034.1600000000003
like oh

4031.839 --> 4035.2
well it must be talking about himself

4034.16 --> 4036.3999999999996
then

4035.2 --> 4038.0
really

4036.4 --> 4042.64
well nobody actually

4038.0 --> 4044.72
met yeah attempted to confirm that

4042.64 --> 4047.5989999999997
seem to be running into the same problem

4044.72 --> 4050.72
here over and over again sicarius

4047.599 --> 4050.7200000000003
who else is it

4052.559 --> 4057.039
well maybe

4055.28 --> 4059.52
it's everyone

4057.039 --> 4061.6800000000003
maybe it is

4059.52 --> 4063.44
spirit mechanics

4061.68 --> 4065.5989999999997
of him

4063.44 --> 4069.76
but not exclusively

4065.599 --> 4069.76
so it can also mean other things

4069.92 --> 4075.2000000000003
that's the thing oh clear up these

4072.319 --> 4076.4
misconceptions oh you mean more other

4075.2 --> 4078.16
people

4076.4 --> 4082.079
doubling down

4078.16 --> 4084.8799999999997
on that why it means that despite nobody

4082.079 --> 4087.76
in the book actually asking it and jesus

4084.88 --> 4089.92
never literally saying it yeah

4087.76 --> 4092.6400000000003
yeah i know paula does that like no

4089.92 --> 4095.839
other it's very good at

4092.64 --> 4098.239
continuing the priestly tradition

4095.839 --> 4098.239
i know

4099.12 --> 4104.199
you can lead them to water you can't

4100.799 --> 4104.199
make them drink

4106.0 --> 4108.56
yeah

4106.96 --> 4111.04
i know that's what i'm trying to do

4108.56 --> 4112.88
right here

4111.04 --> 4115.12
right it's called critical thinking

4112.88 --> 4119.56
based inquiry

4115.12 --> 4119.5599999999995
seem to all have a problem with it

4130.799 --> 4134.4
and we arrive back at the little oh

4132.96 --> 4136.799
really

4134.4 --> 4136.799
we do

4138.64 --> 4142.719
so you're going to invoke little gods

4140.48 --> 4142.718999999999
now

4144.839 --> 4148.2789999999995
wow

4146.719 --> 4151.6
how

4148.279 --> 4154.080000000001
strawmanish of you

4151.6 --> 4156.799
that's amazing

4154.08 --> 4159.679
so if you are going to say

4156.799 --> 4161.92
yeah we disagree with this priestly

4159.679 --> 4164.159
based unconfirmed

4161.92 --> 4167.04
assumption that when jesus talks about

4164.159 --> 4168.5599999999995
the son of man that exclusively means

4167.04 --> 4170.96
himself

4168.56 --> 4173.679
if you say that then suddenly we were

4170.96 --> 4175.12
talking about the little gods

4173.679 --> 4177.759
doctrine

4175.12 --> 4179.2789999999995
that's interesting i mean if some people

4177.759 --> 4181.759
that happen to

4179.279 --> 4184.4800000000005
historically believe in the little gods

4181.759 --> 4186.319
in another format not in jesus whatever

4184.48 --> 4188.4
and they said it

4186.319 --> 4191.04
well could it be that

4188.4 --> 4192.719
they were wrong in the way they conduct

4191.04 --> 4195.5199999999995
themselves long in their personal

4192.719 --> 4197.199
beliefs but maybe they were right about

4195.52 --> 4200.080000000001
that maybe they were pointing out the

4197.199 --> 4201.759999999999
same thing because it's real that's

4200.08 --> 4206.08
really the thing

4201.76 --> 4206.08
he never actually confirmed

4206.159 --> 4210.159
that he was exclusively talking about

4208.64 --> 4211.84
himself

4210.159 --> 4213.04
you haven't been able to present

4211.84 --> 4216.159000000001
anything

4213.04 --> 4219.12
from the bible

4216.159 --> 4222.0
that literally confirms it

4219.12 --> 4223.92
you see and that makes it a priestly

4222.0 --> 4225.679
belief

4223.92 --> 4228.2390000000005
and now you're sl yeah you're straw

4225.679 --> 4230.64
manning you're slandering like oh

4228.239 --> 4234.0
they're of the devil we've got a special

4230.64 --> 4236.4800000000005
warning clause if somebody starts asking

4234.0 --> 4238.56
questions about where's the confirmation

4236.48 --> 4240.5599999999995
of this little detail

4238.56 --> 4242.2390000000005
oh we're gonna appoint them as little

4240.56 --> 4245.52
g's oh

4242.239 --> 4248.239
oh how convenient devil persecutor

4245.52 --> 4248.2390000000005
projector

4257.44 --> 4266.36
jesus is the confirmation no

4261.52 --> 4266.360000000001
a chant for me fundies chant for me

4276.32 --> 4281.199
yeah the sorry service day that comment

4279.04 --> 4284.239
is completely useless

4281.199 --> 4284.239
completely useless

4285.199 --> 4289.199
i don't know where you're getting it and

4287.04 --> 4292.32
it's absolutely nothing even close to

4289.199 --> 4292.32
what i'm talking about

4292.56 --> 4298.2390000000005
none of you seem to understand that none

4294.8 --> 4301.92
of you seem to understand

4298.239 --> 4305.839999999999
the inquiry that i am attempting

4301.92 --> 4308.4
concerning the meaning what he said

4305.84 --> 4311.400000000001
i'll seem to be chanting now

4308.4 --> 4311.4
projecting

4317.44 --> 4320.48
yeah so run away

4324.88 --> 4331.52
right i'm just gonna keep saying it how

4328.159 --> 4334.0
it is you know nobody has actually

4331.52 --> 4336.4800000000005
provided any

4334.0 --> 4338.64
definitive evidence

4336.48 --> 4341.44
i've addressed the issue

4338.64 --> 4342.64
elaborately i can't get more elaborate

4341.44 --> 4344.639999999999
than this

4342.64 --> 4347.360000000001
and now you're all starting to project

4344.64 --> 4350.88
all these anti-christian

4347.36 --> 4350.88
accusations against me

4351.04 --> 4356.159
i bet there were a lot of people in the

4353.6 --> 4359.84
medieval times

4356.159 --> 4360.639999999999
that were facing the same issues

4359.84 --> 4362.4800000000005
right

4360.64 --> 4364.2390000000005
because that's what they did back then

4362.48 --> 4366.959999999999
to people that actually had some

4364.239 --> 4369.199
critical thinking that knew some good

4366.96 --> 4371.44
natural skills that could contradict the

4369.199 --> 4373.12
priestly chants

4371.44 --> 4374.5599999999995
yeah they started to point fingers at

4373.12 --> 4376.48
that nem too

4374.56 --> 4378.96
they arrest them he's a blasphemer or

4376.48 --> 4382.5599999999995
she's a blasphemer or a witch

4378.96 --> 4382.56
yeah it's very familiar

4382.96 --> 4387.04
history repeats itself doesn't it

4391.92 --> 4396.159
oh the bible is now now you're

4394.0 --> 4398.48
strawmanning me with that oh the bible

4396.159 --> 4400.239
was a strawberry oh did i say that

4398.48 --> 4403.28
remember

4400.239 --> 4405.839999999999
remember about what i addressed you on

4403.28 --> 4408.08
suggestive questions and all that

4405.84 --> 4410.64
well you've gone beyond that you're just

4408.08 --> 4410.64
stating

4410.719 --> 4415.28
a response to a question that i never

4413.12 --> 4417.84
asked did i say the bible was a straw

4415.28 --> 4419.92
man no i didn't

4417.84 --> 4422.56
i don't think anybody else in here said

4419.92 --> 4428.36
that either

4422.56 --> 4428.360000000001
so you were now chanting like fundies

4443.28 --> 4447.719
[Music]

4444.719 --> 4447.719
so

4454.56 --> 4456.88
what

4459.12 --> 4463.92
yeah dude shut up

4461.12 --> 4467.88
it's not flurfing time

4463.92 --> 4467.88
stop whining about it

4483.679 --> 4490.32
you showed

4485.52 --> 4492.0
i sh oh sicarius oh sircarius you straw

4490.32 --> 4493.92
manning funny

4492.0 --> 4496.32
the bye boys and this drama i didn't

4493.92 --> 4498.32
even read the rest of the sentence i

4496.32 --> 4500.719
showed you where jesus called himself

4498.32 --> 4502.96
the ju son of man

4500.719 --> 4504.719
his words did you disagree with his

4502.96 --> 4506.4800000000005
words no i didn't disagree with his

4504.719 --> 4509.6
words i just disagree

4506.48 --> 4512.239
with that it is a clarification that

4509.6 --> 4515.52
when he says son of man

4512.239 --> 4515.5199999999995
talking about himself

4516.719 --> 4522.84
he's just

4517.92 --> 4526.4
using it just saying son of man all of a

4522.84 --> 4528.4800000000005
sudden is not like hey when i say the

4526.4 --> 4532.32
son of man i'm actually talking about

4528.48 --> 4533.199
myself and nobody's asking that like hey

4532.32 --> 4534.639999999999
what

4533.199 --> 4539.04
who's this son of man you're talking

4534.64 --> 4540.400000000001
about nobody is asking yeah

4539.04 --> 4543.76
so yeah

4540.4 --> 4546.239
oh the first mention of the name of the

4543.76 --> 4548.2390000000005
reference yeah that's not proof that

4546.239 --> 4551.04
he's explaining that he's talking about

4548.239 --> 4553.678999999999
himself numpty

4551.04 --> 4556.4
religiotart numpty

4553.679 --> 4559.4
are you gonna strawman me some more

4556.4 --> 4559.4
sicarius

4566.32 --> 4569.32
ah

4602.48 --> 4605.48
so

4615.52 --> 4618.88
yep clearly i know

4620.56 --> 4627.4400000000005
look i'm not denying that jesus went

4623.28 --> 4629.92
through some excruciating event

4627.44 --> 4630.879999999999
absolutely and i think a miracle

4629.92 --> 4632.32
happened

4630.88 --> 4635.04
i just

4632.32 --> 4638.32
don't think that

4635.04 --> 4640.48
whether he died or survived the process

4638.32 --> 4642.159
is not even relevant in the true

4640.48 --> 4643.5199999999995
cornerstone argument

4642.159 --> 4646.159
right

4643.52 --> 4648.56
if he turns out that he had actually

4646.159 --> 4650.799999999999
died and then he resurrected i'm

4648.56 --> 4653.1990000000005
actually fine with it

4650.8 --> 4656.320000000001
here's the thing though

4653.199 --> 4658.159
my real problem is when people say

4656.32 --> 4659.36
that he

4658.159 --> 4662.719
died

4659.36 --> 4665.839999999999
for your sins because of the implication

4662.719 --> 4665.84
of such a statement

4669.52 --> 4673.84
and because of the nature of what sins

4672.56 --> 4676.8
are

4673.84 --> 4679.679
and the rules concerning

4676.8 --> 4681.12
sacrifice

4679.679 --> 4684.0
huh

4681.12 --> 4686.5599999999995
yeah that's my real problem

4684.0 --> 4688.239
that's my main issue that's where i get

4686.56 --> 4690.0
really offended

4688.239 --> 4691.36
because i feel

4690.0 --> 4694.0
like

4691.36 --> 4695.759999999999
like a massive amount of people have

4694.0 --> 4697.6
been

4695.76 --> 4699.92
over the ages

4697.6 --> 4701.04
been indoctrinated with chants that are

4699.92 --> 4703.6
actually

4701.04 --> 4706.08
satanic in nature

4703.6 --> 4708.4800000000005
and and you haven't caught on you can't

4706.08 --> 4708.48
see it

4708.64 --> 4714.64
it's so deep and grained so like i think

4712.159 --> 4715.679
like lots of people have died

4714.64 --> 4717.92
for it

4715.679 --> 4723.36
for it and against it and when that

4717.92 --> 4723.36
happens it like echoes it becomes feared

4723.92 --> 4730.4
it becomes a feared concept

4727.12 --> 4730.4
well i'm not afraid

4732.0 --> 4736.0
by jesus's own recommendation i am not

4734.88 --> 4738.08
afraid

4736.0 --> 4740.32
to go there

4738.08 --> 4743.12
i believe jesus was

4740.32 --> 4743.12
the best of us

4743.76 --> 4749.360000000001
whether he was exactly that man from the

4746.64 --> 4751.360000000001
bible or whether that bible was inspired

4749.36 --> 4754.48
on a real man because i do think there

4751.36 --> 4756.08
was a real man of that is the origin

4754.48 --> 4758.879999999999
point of that

4756.08 --> 4758.88
his teachings

4759.04 --> 4763.44
but it is the teachings that is the

4761.12 --> 4767.76
actual awakening and is the teachings

4763.44 --> 4772.5599999999995
that allows others to ascend him

4767.76 --> 4775.6
by his own red letter words not open for

4772.56 --> 4780.400000000001
interpretation quite literal

4775.6 --> 4782.08
in contrast to the claim that when jesus

4780.4 --> 4783.44
mentions

4782.08 --> 4785.0
the son of man

4783.44 --> 4788.879999999999
that that

4785.0 --> 4793.36
exclusively implies himself

4788.88 --> 4795.84
right there's no actual literally

4793.36 --> 4799.5199999999995
red letter words about that

4795.84 --> 4802.159000000001
that is not up for interpretation

4799.52 --> 4804.400000000001
now jesus was actually quite literal

4802.159 --> 4807.36
when he said

4804.4 --> 4809.679
and personal in his statement format

4807.36 --> 4811.44
about that people can

4809.679 --> 4813.84
ascend him

4811.44 --> 4818.759999999999
i'm slightly paraphrasing but that's a

4813.84 --> 4818.76
very famous part of what he said

4819.28 --> 4823.28
and i'm

4820.32 --> 4823.28
totally with that

4824.239 --> 4829.44
reading the bible answer the questions

4826.8 --> 4829.4400000000005
yeah yeah

4829.52 --> 4833.76
go go read it again see if you're going

4831.92 --> 4836.56
to read it again see if you can find any

4833.76 --> 4838.2390000000005
part where jesus actually says like

4836.56 --> 4839.92
yeah this son of man i know i've

4838.239 --> 4842.959999999999
referenced it a couple of times i'm

4839.92 --> 4845.28
actually talking about myself then

4842.96 --> 4847.6
right so you pay attention see if you

4845.28 --> 4849.5199999999995
can find that for me right and then come

4847.6 --> 4852.639
back at me

4849.52 --> 4855.1990000000005
tell me how i was wrong

4852.639 --> 4857.84
right when you find it

4855.199 --> 4860.638999999999
a statement that isn't just him

4857.84 --> 4862.96
mentioning it

4860.639 --> 4866.08
the son of man just subtly mentioning

4862.96 --> 4867.04
that and no inquiry to it

4866.08 --> 4869.6
yeah

4867.04 --> 4872.4
because i've seen enough of those quotes

4869.6 --> 4872.400000000001
from the bible

4873.52 --> 4878.639
but there's doesn't seem to be any

4875.84 --> 4880.08
biblical confirmation or clarification

4878.639 --> 4882.4800000000005
as to

4880.08 --> 4884.96
when jesus mentions the son of man that

4882.48 --> 4887.04
that exclusively

4884.96 --> 4890.8
means himself

4887.04 --> 4893.28
yeah i hold my case

4890.8 --> 4895.92
stand firm

4893.28 --> 4895.92
this is called

4900.84 --> 4906.719
inquiry oh really can can you literally

4904.239 --> 4906.718999999999
quote that

4910.96 --> 4916.639
you're just chanting again

4913.44 --> 4919.44
you're you are blind aren't you like you

4916.639 --> 4920.96
are literally so chant bound you can't

4919.44 --> 4923.96
even read

4920.96 --> 4923.96
anymore

4946.159 --> 4949.36
son of man this is what the sovereign

4948.0 --> 4950.639
lord says

4949.36 --> 4954.159
oh you mean

4950.639 --> 4956.2390000000005
jesus is being called the son of man

4954.159 --> 4959.12
by other people they just say hey son of

4956.239 --> 4961.5199999999995
man

4959.12 --> 4963.199
all right that's interesting

4961.52 --> 4965.4400000000005
so i guess

4963.199 --> 4968.638999999999
it's just kind of like

4965.44 --> 4970.5599999999995
accepted it out of nowhere

4968.639 --> 4974.2390000000005
like hey son of man

4970.56 --> 4974.2390000000005
well maybe it was kind of a nickname

4974.4 --> 4979.759999999999
but still no clarification though no

4976.88 --> 4979.76
clarification

4981.28 --> 4984.84
it just starts mentioning it yeah it's

4982.96 --> 4986.56
not a man

4984.84 --> 4988.639
but

4986.56 --> 4992.0
i don't think there's any part in the

4988.639 --> 4994.4800000000005
bible where he literally says look guys

4992.0 --> 4997.6
when i'm saying son of man i'm actually

4994.48 --> 4997.599999999999
talking about myself

4998.0 --> 5004.4
exclusively

5000.96 --> 5007.36
like why wouldn't you just call

5004.4 --> 5007.36
yourself jesus

5012.32 --> 5014.4
right

5013.12 --> 5016.48
why

5014.4 --> 5018.4
why would you bring in a a weird

5016.48 --> 5020.718999999999
description like that especially with

5018.4 --> 5023.44
such a complicated meaning such a

5020.719 --> 5023.44
fundamental

5024.08 --> 5029.12
meaning

5025.28 --> 5030.8
right well maybe because

5029.12 --> 5034.0
it wasn't

5030.8 --> 5036.56
exclusively about him it's just like he

5034.0 --> 5038.96
started to talk like that in parables

5036.56 --> 5040.320000000001
with existential meanings fractal

5038.96 --> 5044.719
implications

5040.32 --> 5046.0
and people just started assuming

5044.719 --> 5048.08
he was

5046.0 --> 5050.4
talking about himself

5048.08 --> 5053.04
even though he never specifically

5050.4 --> 5055.36
clarified how that works he never

5053.04 --> 5058.08
explained

5055.36 --> 5060.08
his parable talking did he

5058.08 --> 5061.76
he never did that he never just said

5060.08 --> 5064.8
okay guys

5061.76 --> 5067.6
i'm gonna do this this is exactly what

5064.8 --> 5071.76
it means here's the the code

5067.6 --> 5072.88
to understand how i'm talking now

5071.76 --> 5074.4800000000005
did he

5072.88 --> 5075.4400000000005
or did he do that

5074.48 --> 5079.759999999999
like to

5075.44 --> 5079.759999999999
learn about if he actually did that

5083.52 --> 5088.0
oh yeah

5085.36 --> 5090.0
oh keep chanting i'm getting really sick

5088.0 --> 5091.28
of you by the way secari is really sick

5090.0 --> 5094.239
of you

5091.28 --> 5096.4
i don't like chanting chanting fundies

5094.239 --> 5099.28
and you are a fundy

5096.4 --> 5102.96
you are you're acting like one it's

5099.28 --> 5102.96
really getting on my nerves

5105.52 --> 5109.6
all right cleary yeah

5107.679 --> 5110.56
it's a little blasphemous but

5109.6 --> 5112.4800000000005
little

5110.56 --> 5115.4400000000005
well yeah if you if everybody calls you

5112.48 --> 5117.44
a son of a [ __ ]

5115.44 --> 5119.919999999999
like does that mean

5117.44 --> 5121.839999999999
that when you say son of a [ __ ]

5119.92 --> 5123.76
that you are talking about yourself

5121.84 --> 5126.159000000001
because everybody calls you a son of a

5123.76 --> 5127.52
[ __ ] right it's kind of a ridiculous

5126.159 --> 5129.199
metaphor but

5131.199 --> 5136.239
chanting funny

5133.04 --> 5139.199
and you have no critical thinking skills

5136.239 --> 5142.4
you're constantly blurring things up

5139.199 --> 5142.4
it's really annoying

5146.8 --> 5151.8
right i'm gonna take two minute break

fear porting yourself you're spiraling

5254.4 --> 5258.239
stop doing it i mean it

5258.719 --> 5265.88
no room for that [ __ ]

5262.239 --> 5265.879999999999
take care of it

5279.22 --> 5282.709
[Music]

5282.719 --> 5288.0
the world hit yeah i know cycarius i

5284.88 --> 5288.0
know all about it

5289.92 --> 5295.4400000000005
i don't hate you i just

5291.92 --> 5297.52
you're a waste of my time that's all

5295.44 --> 5301.32
and i'm gonna call you exactly what you

5297.52 --> 5301.320000000001
are based on your actions

5395.44 --> 5401.678999999999
yeah by the way thank you service day

5399.199 --> 5403.839999999999
earlier

5401.679 --> 5407.84
for supporting my argument

5403.84 --> 5407.84
i'm glad you're seeing it

5410.96 --> 5416.32
but like this whole antichrist thing

5413.679 --> 5416.32
like don't

5416.8 --> 5422.56
do it

5417.76 --> 5422.56
just realize it's always been like that

5422.88 --> 5428.0
it's always been like that people are

5425.12 --> 5430.12
like this people can't

5428.0 --> 5432.719
the chanting of these priestly

5430.12 --> 5435.199
indoctrinations has been happening for a

5432.719 --> 5436.159
thousand years

5435.199 --> 5439.04
the who

5436.159 --> 5439.04
who long knows

5439.44 --> 5442.4
how long

5440.719 --> 5445.199
who knows

5442.4 --> 5446.96
it will keep continuing

5445.199 --> 5449.36
doesn't mean

5446.96 --> 5453.159
like oh the end is right now right here

5449.36 --> 5453.159
no no no

5470.96 --> 5474.84
thousand what

5483.199 --> 5486.199
so

5490.719 --> 5495.6
you said a thousand years yes

5494.08 --> 5497.44
chanting

5495.6 --> 5500.08
for a thousand years

5497.44 --> 5500.08
that's right

5500.8 --> 5505.360000000001
i don't think that

5503.04 --> 5508.159
i think there's a century basically

5505.36 --> 5508.159
inserted

5515.28 --> 5519.84
like i don't think that jesus was like

5522.159 --> 5526.44
2000 years ago i think it's a thousand

5524.08 --> 5528.0
years ago but yeah that's based on

5526.44 --> 5530.08
[Music]

5528.0 --> 5531.52
calendar situations

5530.08 --> 5533.04
i think that just

5531.52 --> 5534.8
yeah

5533.04 --> 5537.92
at some point

5534.8 --> 5537.92
an emperor did that

5538.719 --> 5542.4800000000005
just said like add another thousand

5540.56 --> 5545.4800000000005
years to this and then we can split up

5542.48 --> 5545.48
history

5571.76 --> 5574.76
what

5592.56 --> 5596.84
no i can't sicarius

5602.56 --> 5607.360000000001
it's based something very superficial

5605.36 --> 5608.96
there's indications that a certain

5607.36 --> 5611.5199999999995
emperor i don't even know the freaking

5608.96 --> 5611.52
name okay

5612.48 --> 5618.08
adam probably knows

5615.44 --> 5622.0
that basically added

5618.08 --> 5622.0
a thousand years on the calendar

5626.48 --> 5629.5199999999995
that's it that's

5628.48 --> 5632.718999999999
like the

5629.52 --> 5633.84
that's the end until of the data about

5632.719 --> 5636.08
that

5633.84 --> 5636.08
right

5642.239 --> 5647.12
like you'll have to ask like real deep

5645.84 --> 5650.0
research

5647.12 --> 5653.5199999999995
historians

5650.0 --> 5655.76
i'm not one of those i am

5653.52 --> 5657.120000000001
more on the surface but i do pay

5655.76 --> 5660.0
attention

5657.12 --> 5662.48
i just i'd like i can't really source

5660.0 --> 5663.92
everything i've ever absorbed i can't

5662.48 --> 5666.239
source it all

5663.92 --> 5670.36
i just can't

5666.239 --> 5670.36
they will remember it

5690.8 --> 5693.8
so

5715.04 --> 5718.84
right i've heard of that

5733.679 --> 5736.719
oh you do really good

5738.4 --> 5741.5599999999995
all right

5761.92 --> 5768.52
all right getting listen it's still like

5763.76 --> 5768.52
this you misspell his name

5778.32 --> 5782.719
it just sounded interesting without okay

5780.32 --> 5785.719
fine well now you now you've heard about

5782.719 --> 5785.719
it

5791.76 --> 5795.679
it technically doesn't really matter

5793.679 --> 5797.36
whether it is a thousand years or two

5795.679 --> 5799.1990000000005
thousand years

5797.36 --> 5800.4
it is important is to know that it's

5799.199 --> 5803.44
been

5800.4 --> 5804.719
a massive amount of generations having

5803.44 --> 5807.44
gone through

5804.719 --> 5809.76
and getting accustomed to

5807.44 --> 5811.04
the priestly chanting that is part of

5809.76 --> 5812.4800000000005
well

5811.04 --> 5814.96
theocracy

5812.48 --> 5816.879999999999
which is what it is what it was most of

5814.96 --> 5818.4
the time

5816.88 --> 5820.0
and they get used to it and it's like

5818.4 --> 5822.159
this is

5820.0 --> 5823.84
what it it's just the priest over and

5822.159 --> 5825.5199999999995
over again just saying this is what it

5823.84 --> 5827.84
means this is what it means this is what

5825.52 --> 5827.84
it means

5830.0 --> 5835.679
and then people like remember that and

5833.119 --> 5837.36
then they just start repeating the

5835.679 --> 5838.4
chance

5837.36 --> 5842.159
it's

5838.4 --> 5842.159
basic indoctrination really

5843.76 --> 5848.08
and it is a blockage to critical

5845.76 --> 5851.1990000000005
thinking based inquiry

5848.08 --> 5851.199
and that is what i'm doing

5851.6 --> 5857.76
i never allowed myself to become

5853.84 --> 5857.76
indoctrinated with these things

5858.08 --> 5861.6
like

5859.28 --> 5861.599999999999
ever

5863.119 --> 5869.759999999999
well that's not entirely true

5865.84 --> 5873.04
i have at times just been like so

5869.76 --> 5875.360000000001
hard like when i was really weak

5873.04 --> 5877.92
when i went doesn't make

5875.36 --> 5880.159
going to church week necessarily but

5877.92 --> 5882.4
yeah this few years ago when i was

5880.159 --> 5883.36
really in a bad state and then i went to

5882.4 --> 5885.28
the

5883.36 --> 5887.44
church of latter-day saints right across

5885.28 --> 5889.36
the street like literally right there

5887.44 --> 5891.759999999999
you see it in the camera view every

5889.36 --> 5891.759999999999
morning

5893.44 --> 5899.599999999999
i did kind of like okay i am completely

5896.32 --> 5902.639
lost i couldn't get a grip anymore

5899.6 --> 5904.320000000001
i was just too stressed out too scared

5902.639 --> 5905.84
and i did kind of like okay i'm just

5904.32 --> 5907.119
gonna

5905.84 --> 5909.6
chant

5907.119 --> 5911.839999999999
with it

5909.6 --> 5914.96
but i've never been like really

5911.84 --> 5917.04
consciously strong accepting certain

5914.96 --> 5918.96
types of chance

5917.04 --> 5922.639
and one of them being like he died for

5918.96 --> 5925.76
your sins i really detest that i did

5922.639 --> 5928.2390000000005
i've always detested it i've always on

5925.76 --> 5931.6
an intuitive level thought it was an

5928.239 --> 5931.599999999999
absolute affront

5932.48 --> 5936.48
to

5933.6 --> 5940.400000000001
to the power of jesus

5936.48 --> 5943.04
to say that and it always is when people

5940.4 --> 5946.239
say that it's always being abused it's

5943.04 --> 5948.88
always bad every time the actions coming

5946.239 --> 5954.32
forth from that is always bad

5948.88 --> 5957.1990000000005
always always is it bad always is is bad

5954.32 --> 5958.719
it is every time every time somebody

5957.199 --> 5963.04
does that

5958.719 --> 5963.04
it's like a dark invocation

5963.199 --> 5970.599999999999
always every single time people do that

5966.719 --> 5970.6
every single time

5992.719 --> 5996.32
right the only

5994.48 --> 5999.759999999999
even thinkable

5996.32 --> 6002.32
useful or productive application of

5999.76 --> 6002.320000000001
saying that

6003.119 --> 6008.799999999999
is to make people feel guilty and then

6005.28 --> 6011.92
join you or when somebody

6008.8 --> 6014.4800000000005
like really messed up in their life like

6011.92 --> 6016.719
and they're like the the sins or that

6014.48 --> 6018.718999999999
they had just realized that they've

6016.719 --> 6020.719
committed are like staring them in the

6018.719 --> 6022.88
face and like maybe even

6020.719 --> 6024.4
getting them and the edge of suicidal

6022.88 --> 6027.119
thinking and all that

6024.4 --> 6030.96
that then saying like yeah dude it's

6027.119 --> 6033.36
okay jesus died for your sins just like

6030.96 --> 6037.04
as a very quick like

6033.36 --> 6041.04
just to be able to let it go to not be

6037.04 --> 6042.96
mortified about the future right

6041.04 --> 6045.44
that's like the only

6042.96 --> 6047.92
useful application i could ever think of

6045.44 --> 6049.5199999999995
it's like the time when you're super

6047.92 --> 6051.84
weak

6049.52 --> 6053.76
really hurt and you're like about to

6051.84 --> 6057.119000000001
like off yourself or something then

6053.76 --> 6059.679
maybe it's like dude it's okay

6057.119 --> 6061.679
like jesus went through worse

6059.679 --> 6062.84
and you did it all for us right then

6061.679 --> 6067.1990000000005
it's like

6062.84 --> 6070.400000000001
yeah it's like the only moment

6067.199 --> 6071.5199999999995
that i could say like okay okay

6070.4 --> 6074.719
right

6071.52 --> 6076.400000000001
it's not technically correct

6074.719 --> 6079.6
but

6076.4 --> 6081.92
it does kind of help you in such a

6079.6 --> 6084.0
moment and that's it that's it right

6081.92 --> 6086.88
when you're most desperate

6084.0 --> 6089.28
then chanting such a thing might be like

6086.88 --> 6091.6
okay whatever saves you in that moment

6089.28 --> 6093.5199999999995
right whatever keeps you up keeps you

6091.6 --> 6096.159000000001
going

6093.52 --> 6097.52
but when you really carefully and calmly

6096.159 --> 6100.5599999999995
think about it

6097.52 --> 6101.92
it's just nasty it's so bad and when

6100.56 --> 6103.1990000000005
people

6101.92 --> 6106.2390000000005
calmly

6103.199 --> 6108.799999999999
and systematically apply it they usually

6106.239 --> 6109.919999999999
do it just to make other people feel

6108.8 --> 6112.56
guilty

6109.92 --> 6115.28
or to try to exert some pressure to make

6112.56 --> 6117.4400000000005
them do things

6115.28 --> 6118.4
it's bad

6117.44 --> 6120.4
most

6118.4 --> 6123.5199999999995
times people say it

6120.4 --> 6123.5199999999995
it's bad

6125.199 --> 6129.839999999999
you understand where i'm coming from

6126.8 --> 6133.4400000000005
here this is very serious i'm not

6129.84 --> 6137.719
i'm not trying to be controversial here

6133.44 --> 6137.719
i'm being dead serious

6149.36 --> 6153.92
nasty and bad

6151.679 --> 6157.159
whoa

6153.92 --> 6157.159
come on

6170.56 --> 6174.8
would have thought jesus would have

6172.719 --> 6177.52
learned his lesson making others

6174.8 --> 6180.52
declaration what does that mean gideon

6177.52 --> 6180.52
sick

6228.08 --> 6231.28
the only moment is the most dire moment

6229.84 --> 6232.400000000001
yeah godzilla

6231.28 --> 6235.5199999999995
37 you

6232.4 --> 6235.5199999999995
you got me i think

6244.159 --> 6247.839999999999
yeah your name sucks

6271.92 --> 6276.32
oh god yeah gordzil sorry

6284.56 --> 6288.320000000001
yeah it's just

6286.159 --> 6291.679
on the surface it really reads very

6288.32 --> 6291.679
easily like godzilla

6291.84 --> 6295.52
but it is godzilla you're right

6298.719 --> 6304.32
ah indeed clearly nothing is hidden to

6301.199 --> 6304.32
those who wish to see

6314.239 --> 6319.199
i know pj krishan it's okay

6316.48 --> 6319.199
it's just that

6320.48 --> 6325.5199999999995
usually when their name doesn't even fit

6323.04 --> 6328.32
in a single sentence

6325.52 --> 6330.159000000001
it's just get out

6328.32 --> 6333.639
like

6330.159 --> 6333.638999999999
they are spam

6347.36 --> 6355.36
man how long have you been going whoa

6350.719 --> 6355.36
an hour 45 minutes already damn

6355.6 --> 6360.56
yes they are usually troll that's right

6357.679 --> 6360.56
pg crochet

6370.719 --> 6376.08
you heard rumors oh really

6374.4 --> 6381.239
good luck with that

6376.08 --> 6381.239
if they do that people are gonna die

6387.6 --> 6392.400000000001
so they're not going to do that unless

6389.679 --> 6395.04
they like have no other choice than to

6392.4 --> 6400.239
walk up to the chopping block

6395.04 --> 6403.679
and die because that is what will happen

6400.239 --> 6406.0
i'll freaking do it personally

6403.679 --> 6409.119
if i need to

6406.0 --> 6411.199
i have no objections

6409.119 --> 6415.48
to end them

6411.199 --> 6415.48
they will never do that

6417.04 --> 6421.119
you can say they're doing it if they

6419.52 --> 6423.119000000001
actually do that

6421.119 --> 6425.199
and not and like

6423.119 --> 6428.48
people in the supermarkets and all that

6425.199 --> 6430.239
are actually going to enforce it well

6428.48 --> 6433.678999999999
they're going to have a problem very

6430.239 --> 6435.5199999999995
quickly and soon after that like these

6433.679 --> 6438.4
freaking politicians and all that doing

6435.52 --> 6439.4400000000005
that they are going to be surrounded by

6438.4 --> 6440.799999999999
people

6439.44 --> 6444.96
and then they're going to be dragged out

6440.8 --> 6446.4800000000005
of their houses don't know where

6444.96 --> 6448.639
probably going to get a couple of

6446.48 --> 6452.0
bruises

6448.639 --> 6455.4400000000005
not more if they're lucky and then

6452.0 --> 6458.8
they're going to have a very quick trial

6455.44 --> 6458.799999999999
and then they're gonna die

6462.8 --> 6467.119000000001
so

6464.56 --> 6469.04
don't pull that [ __ ] out of me dude i

6467.119 --> 6472.88
don't like it when you do that you have

6469.04 --> 6472.88
to stop doing that i mean it

6475.28 --> 6480.48
don't play into the mind control it's

6478.719 --> 6482.639
all mind control all of it it's all

6480.48 --> 6484.799999999999
suggestive mind control they're saying

6482.639 --> 6488.08
they're like yes

6484.8 --> 6489.52
we have extermination camps right around

6488.08 --> 6491.84
the corner

6489.52 --> 6493.679
you're all forced to go there and every

6491.84 --> 6496.32
time you meet a police officer they're

6493.679 --> 6498.4
going to direct you there

6496.32 --> 6501.759999999999
and then in reality

6498.4 --> 6503.36
nothing happens absolutely

6501.76 --> 6504.400000000001
nothing

6503.36 --> 6506.5599999999995
all right

6504.4 --> 6507.5199999999995
you have to

6506.56 --> 6510.0
break

6507.52 --> 6512.96
that apart see

6510.0 --> 6516.56
it doesn't happen nothing happened it

6512.96 --> 6520.719
was all an illusion to fear bind

6516.56 --> 6523.4400000000005
people's minds you have to see it

6520.719 --> 6526.4800000000005
only when actually things start happen

6523.44 --> 6528.799999999999
that's when you unleash the beast that's

6526.48 --> 6531.599999999999
when you [ __ ] him up you see

6528.8 --> 6532.400000000001
until that time you have to

6531.6 --> 6536.320000000001
not

6532.4 --> 6541.5599999999995
let it get to you in any way

6536.32 --> 6541.5599999999995
like literally just look outside

6541.84 --> 6545.92
it's all good

6543.36 --> 6549.679
nothing is actually happening it only

6545.92 --> 6554.8
happens to people that get caught up in

6549.679 --> 6558.84
the spell don't be those people

6554.8 --> 6558.84
i mean it service day

6585.76 --> 6588.76
uh

6606.88 --> 6612.4800000000005
i think walmart is the source

6609.679 --> 6614.8
well it's very simple those corpora this

6612.48 --> 6618.239
is a corporate

6614.8 --> 6620.96
hostile takeover of actual

6618.239 --> 6620.959999999999
society

6622.48 --> 6628.5599999999995
using the government

6625.84 --> 6631.679
to keep going

6628.56 --> 6635.04
and to on a voluntary basis

6631.679 --> 6637.4400000000005
allow people to get indoctrinated and

6635.04 --> 6638.56
then end up killing themselves through

6637.44 --> 6640.48
their

6638.56 --> 6642.639
yeah their garbage

6640.48 --> 6644.799999999999
through everything they they use

6642.639 --> 6646.32
they make you use

6644.8 --> 6649.04
these

6646.32 --> 6651.92
tests even it's all terrible all of it

6649.04 --> 6655.599
is terrible all of it is 100 useless

6651.92 --> 6658.4
hundred percent useless hundred percent

6655.599 --> 6660.639
useless hundred percent useless

6658.4 --> 6664.879999999999
hundred percent

6660.639 --> 6667.76
not rounded up or down hundred percent

6664.88 --> 6669.76
useless nothing good can come from any

6667.76 --> 6673.92
of it

6669.76 --> 6677.280000000001
do not participate do not agree

6673.92 --> 6678.84
do not be swayed to become part of it do

6677.28 --> 6681.759999999999
not be

6678.84 --> 6683.76
bribed to become part of it

6681.76 --> 6687.1990000000005
because you just had to get that

6683.76 --> 6690.0
vacation or you just had to do no

6687.199 --> 6694.239
every time anybody participates

6690.0 --> 6696.32
goes to their to that side takes the v

6694.239 --> 6698.959999999999
they literally

6696.32 --> 6702.96
invoke like a hostile attack

6698.96 --> 6702.96
on themselves and everybody else

6703.08 --> 6706.96
non-participation non-participation

6706.08 --> 6711.44
must

6706.96 --> 6711.44
eventually reach hundred percent

6712.08 --> 6717.76
those that don't will die

6714.48 --> 6720.638999999999
by their own stupidity

6717.76 --> 6723.1990000000005
by blind trust to people that

6720.639 --> 6725.84
openly declare they want to exterminate

6723.199 --> 6725.839999999999
humanity

6732.48 --> 6736.08
right

6733.679 --> 6737.36
it has to all be voluntary because they

6736.08 --> 6739.76
cannot

6737.36 --> 6742.239
technically force

6739.76 --> 6743.76
they can't do it if they do it it's over

6742.239 --> 6745.919999999999
very quickly

6743.76 --> 6748.719
so much pressure built up

6745.92 --> 6752.32
like they're gonna be torn apart

6748.719 --> 6752.32
and that's not a metaphor

6757.52 --> 6763.679
so they can keep bluffs going don't let

6760.8 --> 6765.599
it get to you don't let it get to you

6763.679 --> 6768.96
can't actually do it

6765.599 --> 6771.360000000001
some corporations might suddenly do it

6768.96 --> 6772.639
because they think they're being trendy

6771.36 --> 6774.4
when they're actually just being

6772.639 --> 6777.119
completely insane

6774.4 --> 6778.4
and then they must

6777.119 --> 6780.0
must

6778.4 --> 6784.0
be boycotted

6780.0 --> 6786.88
must be boycotted until they are utterly

6784.0 --> 6786.88
out of business

6789.52 --> 6794.320000000001
and then if all possible quickly bought

6791.679 --> 6797.4400000000005
up and replaced

6794.32 --> 6798.96
completely rearranged so that they can

6797.44 --> 6801.839999999999
completely

6798.96 --> 6803.92
lawfully bypass all of the nonsense

6801.84 --> 6807.4400000000005
right if you need b

6803.92 --> 6810.96
then literally just make

6807.44 --> 6814.48
a barter system on the spot

6810.96 --> 6817.28
or whatever use some crypto or something

6814.48 --> 6819.36
as paper just anything that can make you

6817.28 --> 6820.4
completely

6819.36 --> 6823.28
free

6820.4 --> 6826.28
from these stupid judicial [ __ ]

6823.28 --> 6826.28
routines

6837.28 --> 6840.88
right it's it's a

6842.159 --> 6846.239
corporate

6843.44 --> 6850.08
corporatist hostile takeover

6846.239 --> 6852.959999999999
and the only response

6850.08 --> 6854.8
that could make us survive this entire

6852.96 --> 6859.28
process is

6854.8 --> 6861.599
civil war against the corporations

6859.28 --> 6864.4
and that must be a cold war

6861.599 --> 6866.4800000000005
can't just start trashing things

6864.4 --> 6868.719
that's gonna demoralize everybody it's

6866.48 --> 6872.4
gonna just make a mess it's gonna take

6868.719 --> 6875.679
things away no but absolute cold war

6872.4 --> 6878.0
civil disobedience non-participation

6875.679 --> 6880.4
lawsuits

6878.0 --> 6881.84
whatever you can full

6880.4 --> 6884.08
merciless

6881.84 --> 6886.159000000001
critical inquiry

6884.08 --> 6889.119
everything you can do

6886.159 --> 6892.799999999999
like a civil cold war

6889.119 --> 6894.5599999999995
against the corporatist hostile takeover

6892.8 --> 6898.320000000001
of society

6894.56 --> 6898.320000000001
it's the only sensible thing you can do

6899.04 --> 6903.28
and

6899.92 --> 6906.4800000000005
yeah when that cold war

6903.28 --> 6907.679
is broken it will be broken with massive

6906.48 --> 6909.919999999999
slaughter

6907.679 --> 6911.4400000000005
and the slaughter will be

6909.92 --> 6914.8
the people

6911.44 --> 6917.5199999999995
which are vastly outnumbered that are

6914.8 --> 6920.400000000001
being part of this

6917.52 --> 6922.96
crazy mind control

6920.4 --> 6924.799999999999
eugenics operation

6922.96 --> 6926.56
to exterminate

6924.8 --> 6929.679
human life

6926.56 --> 6932.8
and take away all freedom

6929.679 --> 6934.8
it's that simple really right and with

6932.8 --> 6937.119000000001
that i'm gonna round out the show so

6934.8 --> 6938.56
thanks everyone for coming i hope you

6937.119 --> 6940.96
liked this show

6938.56 --> 6943.1990000000005
it was very energetic

6940.96 --> 6945.84
lots of

6943.199 --> 6948.96
reflections on the bible and then the

6945.84 --> 6951.599
last uh 15 minutes talking a little bit

6948.96 --> 6954.639
of society issues

6951.599 --> 6956.159000000001
that are very relevant of course

6954.639 --> 6958.8
but i don't like to talk about it

6956.159 --> 6960.879999999999
endlessly because eventually it gets me

6958.8 --> 6962.56
either really

6960.88 --> 6964.719
angry

6962.56 --> 6966.56
or demoralized

6964.719 --> 6967.679
and i don't want to do that

6966.56 --> 6971.04
you know

6967.679 --> 6972.96
then i will eventually become part of

6971.04 --> 6975.44
the indoctrinated crowd and that's why i

6972.96 --> 6978.159
always say like just don't

6975.44 --> 6981.199
just don't go there don't echo the

6978.159 --> 6984.48
paranoia don't echo the

6981.199 --> 6986.239
the suggestions that haven't actually

6984.48 --> 6989.119
happened physically that you don't have

6986.239 --> 6991.28
physical proof of that it's real

6989.119 --> 6993.36
don't get caught up and panicked about

6991.28 --> 6995.84
that because then you fall into the

6993.36 --> 6996.719
spell and they will end up maneuvering

6995.84 --> 6999.1990000000005
you

6996.719 --> 7002.639
so don't do that thank you gorzilla for

not been streaming for that long
