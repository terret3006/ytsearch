0.03 --> 13.049
oh good morning this is flat earth

9.87 --> 17.49
early-bird number 19 and your host

13.049 --> 21.439
Arwen I'm starting half hour earlier

17.49 --> 24.858999999999998
than usual and I think I might actually

21.439 --> 29.939
keep on doing that every Monday since

24.859 --> 32.85
Nathan is starting also an hour sooner

29.939 --> 36.809
so I'm gonna start half an hour earlier

32.85 --> 40.11
I think from now I have no objections to

36.809 --> 45.36
do it anyway I mostly just waiting an

40.11 --> 48.379
hour before the show starts anyway yeah

45.36 --> 53.73
so I'm starting a little bit early today

48.379 --> 58.67
how's everyone doing whoo hey McKenzie

53.73 --> 58.669999999999995
rune Thorson Howard Mason

64.17 --> 71.02
there's a lot of talk about Rona

67.24 --> 73.47
Thoresen Tim Osmonds conversation with

71.02 --> 76.69
jarran ism I saw a small part of it but

73.47 --> 78.94
yeah I was watching multiple things at

76.69 --> 80.74
the same time so I did discontinue that

78.94 --> 84.369
I don't know how it went

80.74 --> 88.869
probably went exactly how I expected how

84.369 --> 92.68
one would expect as it always tends to

88.869 --> 101.11
do with Tim Osman hello Ronnie

92.68 --> 104.399
forshay well not unexpectedly because

101.11 --> 107.679
I'm so early and have any guests with me

104.399 --> 110.13
would love to have one anyone is good

107.679 --> 110.13
and

117.32 --> 131.45
yeah let's see there's so much to talk

127.4 --> 133.97
about I just right there after groceries

131.45 --> 136.1
I bumped into somebody new and we had a

133.97 --> 139.60999999999999
long conversation and he was basically

136.1 --> 143.54
complaining about how incompetent the

139.61 --> 147.17000000000002
police is supposed to be and I try to it

143.54 --> 150.29
yeah I know how it works really in that

147.17 --> 153.7
regard try to explain him like what's

150.29 --> 156.98
behind that that there's actually like a

153.7 --> 162.1
statistical financial reason for them to

156.98 --> 167.29999999999998
act the way they do and that it's

162.1 --> 170.54
financially statistically sound but from

167.3 --> 174.769
a personal perspective view things seem

170.54 --> 177.38
just completely illogical and yeah it

174.769 --> 179.33
was very tough for to admit for me to

177.38 --> 182.45
explain this to him but I did manage to

179.33 --> 185.269
succeed his example was that there was

182.45 --> 187.88
some store and had been robbed for three

185.269 --> 190.91
times and yeah insurance money was paid

187.88 --> 194.209
out every time but the police just

190.91 --> 198.1
didn't go after it and only after the

194.209 --> 202.07
third time this happened they started to

198.1 --> 205.16
call it a priority and install direct

202.07 --> 207.68
police cameras there to prevent anything

205.16 --> 209.51
new from happening or to catch the guy

207.68 --> 214.4
because it was apparently the same guy

209.51 --> 219.29
doing it and yeah I explained to him why

214.4 --> 221.42000000000002
that basically actually engaging with

219.29 --> 224.239
the police force and installing things

221.42 --> 227.32899999999998
and getting onto a case is much more

224.239 --> 229.459
expensive than just paying damage a

227.329 --> 234.709
couple of times and he was just like

229.459 --> 237.2
what yeah kind of is and that the

234.709 --> 239.9
controller's basically just put a

237.2 --> 242.78
financial sum together and yeah if

239.9 --> 245.75
there's an incidental robbery that's not

242.78 --> 248.18
really a big problem for insurance

245.75 --> 249.7
companies it's only when it becomes

248.18 --> 251.68
chronic

249.7 --> 253.51
becomes a problem and then when

251.68 --> 256.66
something turns out to be chronic that's

253.51 --> 260.829
when you need to invest to prevent the

256.66 --> 264.28000000000003
chronic leaking of money from persisting

260.829 --> 266.919
rescue that's how it works so yeah I had

264.28 --> 269.65
another one of these conversations right

266.919 --> 273.34
before the show started before I came

269.65 --> 276.84999999999997
here like half an hour ago was good and

273.34 --> 279.01
I think he got it so it was kind of

276.85 --> 281.68
funny because that we both talked about

279.01 --> 284.8
yeah we he said to me like yeah I don't

281.68 --> 286.75
watch the news but because it's all lies

284.8 --> 288.82
and everything but right before like

286.75 --> 290.65
half an hour or like at the start of a

288.82 --> 292.3
conversation he told me he's like what

290.65 --> 296.04999999999995
he had seen on the news and what haven't

292.3 --> 300.19
you seen the news about this so yeah I

296.05 --> 303.72
reminded it like yeah you do watch do

300.19 --> 306.66
you realize that and he was like oh [ __ ]

303.72 --> 313.3
yeah you're actually kind of right I

306.66 --> 315.49
don't know this guy is probably not used

313.3 --> 318.72
to hanging around with a lot of critical

315.49 --> 321.37
thinking people people that think and

318.72 --> 323.97900000000004
conspiracy theorizing lot sure there's

321.37 --> 327.46
lots of those but really critically

323.979 --> 330.96999999999997
think like the crowd that we're in right

327.46 --> 333.13
now there's not used to that really

330.97 --> 334.96000000000004
detailing out what's going on I also

333.13 --> 339.58
told him like yeah if you actually

334.96 --> 344.919
understand why people and funded

339.58 --> 346.9
structures act and have certain policies

344.919 --> 348.729
for a reason and what that reason is

346.9 --> 351.46
what they're actually trying to achieve

348.729 --> 354.25
then you might yeah you gain a better

351.46 --> 359.77
grip at what's going on and what you can

354.25 --> 362.02
do with it and yeah I wonder how much of

359.77 --> 364.33
this he will actually let sing him

362.02 --> 370.27
because it could do him a lot of good he

364.33 --> 372.789
this guy tends to just get how do you

370.27 --> 376.75
say sink into bad situations with bad

372.789 --> 379.81
people because he's not very perceptive

376.75 --> 382.06
in nature he I don't know it it it

379.81 --> 383.26
reminds me a bit about myself in the

382.06 --> 386.05
earlier days

383.26 --> 388.36
when it was also kind of blind and naive

386.05 --> 391.03000000000003
towards other people would always expect

388.36 --> 394.15000000000003
the best and people turn out to be nasty

391.03 --> 400.84
and this guy had had similar experiences

394.15 --> 402.7
not even too long ago so yeah it's it's

400.84 --> 405.7
fascinating to see somebody else with

402.7 --> 410.26
similar patterns and still have a good

405.7 --> 412.12
spirit inside but troubled and yeah give

410.26 --> 414.7
him some actual tips based on my own

412.12 --> 417.76
experience is a really cool thing to do

414.7 --> 420.58
I think and I didn't know it could

417.76 --> 422.40999999999997
really turn out for the better with him

420.58 --> 424.69
because otherwise he's just gonna get in

422.41 --> 426.91
more trouble all that [ __ ] he really

424.69 --> 431.59
needs some grip over what's happening in

426.91 --> 433.74
this world he's part of so and he really

431.59 --> 435.17999999999995
appreciated all the advice I gave him

433.74 --> 446.38
anyway

435.18 --> 457.36
that's me today live report oh and

446.38 --> 459.61
there's ace ml Nathan yep now Nathan I

457.36 --> 461.62
didn't start at 12 I started like 8

459.61 --> 464.53000000000003
minutes ago I'm starting a half an hour

461.62 --> 466.36
earlier maybe next time I'll start an

464.53 --> 471.84999999999997
hour early yet just do it anyway I don't

466.36 --> 473.72
really mind all the Pens we'll see but

471.85 --> 475.77000000000004
I'm starting a little bit earlier so

473.72 --> 483.66
[Music]

475.77 --> 483.65999999999997
maybe I'll get some gifts be nice

491.4 --> 499.419
it's there's been so much talk now about

496.919 --> 503.44
perspective field viewing function

499.419 --> 508.59999999999997
versus autographic view the Mario game

503.44 --> 510.73
view basically side-on view where all

508.6 --> 515.589
the perspective is all perfectly

510.73 --> 518.77
parallel on a on the side view play so

515.589 --> 522.5200000000001
it's actually all viewed as if right in

518.77 --> 525.88
front of it on all locations and yeah

522.52 --> 528.22
you can't use that yeah well you can use

525.88 --> 532.3
that to basically map out what is out

528.22 --> 537.58
there in an entire setup but you can't

532.3 --> 541.7199999999999
draw lines and then claim this is how it

537.58 --> 546.64
looks because of the auto graphic view

541.72 --> 551.64
it it exclude because of the actual

546.64 --> 555.43
sizes it oh yeah it doesn't include many

551.64 --> 557.83
typical perspective effects fact effects

555.43 --> 558.43
that we can observe ourselves in that

557.83 --> 561.339
system

558.43 --> 563.4399999999999
it just does it's not designed to

561.339 --> 566.47
perform viewing functions it's not

563.44 --> 573.339
designed to calculate visual

566.47 --> 575.95
trajectories see the entire auto graphic

573.339 --> 581.44
view system no matter the approach can't

575.95 --> 584.589
be used to calculate or yeah basically

581.44 --> 589.6
as a foundation to calculate what can be

584.589 --> 593.4100000000001
seen it's not designed for that because

589.6 --> 596.82
it because of the auto graphic view it

593.41 --> 600.4
does not perform feeling function in

596.82 --> 602.23
yeah it doesn't make things smaller in

600.4 --> 605.05
the distance which practically happens

602.23 --> 608.529
it can't apply that fraction you can't

605.05 --> 612.01
demonstrate the diffraction effect from

608.529 --> 614.92
a side-on view it's just not possible

612.01 --> 618.25
you can only see it from first-person

614.92 --> 620.649
perspective it's unfortunate but that's

618.25 --> 623.29
just the reality it is a direct side

620.649 --> 628.089
effect from sight itself you can

623.29 --> 632.3499999999999
demonstrate this but yeah you can't yeah

628.089 --> 634.1800000000001
even though if in a setup you have all

632.35 --> 636.279
the distances all the heights measured

634.18 --> 638.199
out exactly yeah you can represent that

636.279 --> 641.23
in an orthographic view in some drawing

638.199 --> 643.689
but everything you're actually going to

641.23 --> 646.4200000000001
see like you're gonna see the optical

643.689 --> 648.519
slant affect the obstruction things not

646.42 --> 650.649
being seen in distance if you're then

648.519 --> 653.319
gonna yeah take the other graphic you

650.649 --> 655.48
parallel is it like no no look the line

653.319 --> 658.99
is straight over it you could you should

655.48 --> 661.899
be able to see it but you can't because

658.99 --> 664.269
in actual viewing function diffraction

661.899 --> 666.16
is still there but you can't represent

664.269 --> 671.86
it with an orthographic view that

666.16 --> 674.649
doesn't work so and yet another rant

671.86 --> 678.04
about perspective and not a perfect view

674.649 --> 682.42
and the curvature calculator this needs

678.04 --> 688.379
to be hammered in a lot like potentially

682.42 --> 691.769
for years to come cause it's just a

688.379 --> 696.49
tough realization for a lot of people

691.769 --> 700.749
that have never considered it before but

696.49 --> 704.769
did have this curvature going over the

700.749 --> 707.8290000000001
horizon myth in its place they've been

704.769 --> 710.559
taught that it's very hot art if you

707.829 --> 713.3789999999999
don't have an alternative to replace it

710.559 --> 717.459
and if you're used to it it's also hard

713.379 --> 720.1
to let go so this just needs to be this

717.459 --> 723.189
needs to sink into society into the

720.1 --> 726.6700000000001
common knowledge base of people everyone

723.189 --> 728.98
with eyes should know this that it works

726.67 --> 731.199
this way and test it out and this is

728.98 --> 736.86
probably like proving that fraction

731.199 --> 742.6189999999999
should probably be done in what is it

736.86 --> 746.9490000000001
like the school when you're say 11 or

742.619 --> 749.049
maybe even starting at 8 or 9 that age

746.949 --> 751.99
cut that's the time that you should on

749.049 --> 754.3389999999999
school just with like basic practical

751.99 --> 757.129
physics learn about diffraction

754.339 --> 760.249
but look if you pass this you're getting

757.129 --> 764.689
an obstruction this is what happens then

760.249 --> 766.6990000000001
explain why but as simple as necessary

764.689 --> 769.519
you can keep it very simple you can go

766.699 --> 771.62
very elaborate into the background and

769.519 --> 773.149
research but we have four kids you can

771.62 --> 775.43
just say it simple but this should be

773.149 --> 777.889
taught in all schools in my personal

775.43 --> 780.2589999999999
opinion can't hurt because it's there

777.889 --> 783.8290000000001
it's good to point it out and to

780.259 --> 787.04
identify it so that that is in there

783.829 --> 788.779
with everyone and can't be fooled people

787.04 --> 790.519
will know like somebody's going to come

788.779 --> 792.439
with some look it's over the courage it

790.519 --> 795.35
must be it's a ball because it's curved

792.439 --> 798.009
then they know no look that is their

795.35 --> 800.8000000000001
fraction I learned about this in school

798.009 --> 804.759
don't you think it is the refraction

800.8 --> 807.3789999999999
because it does correlate and yeah if

804.759 --> 810.11
elevation then you see the optical slant

807.379 --> 812.1800000000001
my grading and viewing angle however

810.11 --> 816.91
they've been taught and they will know

812.18 --> 816.91
it so this would be good in my opinion

817.449 --> 820.449
right

823.079 --> 828.8789999999999
thanks Nathan for sharing on Facebook I

825.969 --> 833.4290000000001
usually don't ask people to share this

828.879 --> 835.9590000000001
stuff on these other platforms because I

833.429 --> 839.4689999999999
am NOT a big fan of most of these

835.959 --> 842.7389999999999
platforms they have been fastly

839.469 --> 847.2090000000001
politicized and of course YouTube in its

842.739 --> 849.6990000000001
own way has also done this as long as

847.209 --> 852.8489999999999
they let me keep doing what I'm doing

849.699 --> 855.9989999999999
then it's all then it's a stalemate I

852.849 --> 859.659
guess it's like ok fine I'll tolerate it

855.999 --> 862.299
as long as you tolerate me and I'll even

859.659 --> 865.779
promote you as long as you stay good

862.299 --> 869.1089999999999
good enough for me we're trying to

865.779 --> 870.699
achieve here but yeah if people share it

869.109 --> 874.8090000000001
ok sure

870.699 --> 876.789
you know it's on you and I'm glad I

874.809 --> 878.9789999999999
guess that it will be viewed by other

876.789 --> 882.509
people so it's good to see yeah for

878.979 --> 887.009
anyone to see this that's interested but

882.509 --> 890.1990000000001
yeah I don't normally don't ask to share

887.009 --> 892.239
by default like for example Nathan does

890.199 --> 897.4789999999999
because I have problems with the other

892.239 --> 900.489
platforms and it's mostly Facebook but

897.479 --> 902.109
yeah hey if you feel like sharing in

900.489 --> 904.419
here if you already have like a platform

902.109 --> 907.419
structure to do this typical thing on to

904.419 --> 910.149
spread Flair's please by all means share

907.419 --> 912.819
it on that platform and be happy to be a

910.149 --> 921.909
part of it hello everyone and all the

912.819 --> 939.2189999999999
other platforms and hey you gotta switch

921.909 --> 946.269
Bella see you corner Baggins bothers

939.219 --> 948.219
desperate red herring factories it's

946.269 --> 950.319
almost like a red herring process in

948.219 --> 954.249
fact they've industrialised their red

950.319 --> 956.17
herrings and lies weaponized it and

954.249 --> 961.41
their mass producing it and their

956.17 --> 961.41
have a code by which they go it's I

962.279 --> 968.519
guess you could almost call them like a

968.82 --> 977.32
social media media misinformation NASA

973.54 --> 979.779
click that is constructing lies for the

977.32 --> 982.72
religion and some of them may actually

979.779 --> 985.54
even believe that anything goes it's all

982.72 --> 989.2900000000001
good because you're doing it for the

985.54 --> 991.899
right thing and others may just hate us

989.29 --> 995.3499999999999
so bad that's all about hate all the

991.899 --> 997.75
Pens but I think that a lot of people on

995.35 --> 1002.5500000000001
the globe side even the crazy ones and

997.75 --> 1005.22
the nasty ones that they're still in the

1002.55 --> 1007.079
bottom of it doing it because they

1005.22 --> 1010.38
really feel they need to defend the

1007.079 --> 1017.8199999999999
globe because it is real to them and

1010.38 --> 1019.4399999999999
they can't let go so but yeah maybe

1017.82 --> 1023.339
there are some of them out there that

1019.44 --> 1026.549
maybe really do completely know and are

1023.339 --> 1028.74
really just driving forth an agenda to

1026.549 --> 1032.459
keep the belief going even though they

1028.74 --> 1035.73
don't believe because of corporate or

1032.459 --> 1038.76
whatever reasons because they were

1035.73 --> 1040.26
ordered to I don't know maybe there are

1038.76 --> 1042.51
some of them out there but I think most

1040.26 --> 1047.03
them really are just delusional and

1042.51 --> 1049.86
caught up in this fanatical vision of

1047.03 --> 1053.1299999999999
how it should be like a globe because

1049.86 --> 1056.76
space and all the possibilities that

1053.13 --> 1060.8090000000002
must be true it can't if you exclude

1056.76 --> 1069.33
that then you're a destroyer that kind

1060.809 --> 1071.69
of thinking so slow dank morning

1069.33 --> 1071.6899999999998
everyone

1093.559 --> 1097.52
now skipper talked about

1101.57 --> 1110.989
I don't know there's so many things I

1107.84 --> 1114.549
want to talk about with other people

1110.989 --> 1118.159
that have their own experience and

1114.549 --> 1120.289
knowledge that they've gather in these

1118.159 --> 1121.46
fields like Morton Lydia for example

1120.289 --> 1124.549
what love to have him on the show

1121.46 --> 1126.6190000000001
sometime talk about what he's been

1124.549 --> 1131.809
dealing with and you know where does he

1126.619 --> 1135.789
get this and and how did he first catch

1131.809 --> 1138.649
on and all that it's very interesting

1135.789 --> 1143.559
subject the mud flood and all that now

1138.649 --> 1147.559
it started in the fresh easy sound based

1143.559 --> 1153.099
architecture it's fascinating and there

1147.559 --> 1157.039
are some other people out there like the

1153.099 --> 1160.789
the egg earth guy or there are multiple

1157.039 --> 1163.34
people that are yeah have taken on this

1160.789 --> 1164.69
model I guess as a principle are doing

1163.34 --> 1168.109
stuff with it I'd love to have one of

1164.69 --> 1170.509
them on the show sometime talk about

1168.109 --> 1173.119
that and how did that come to being is

1170.509 --> 1176.69
there something ethereal or vision

1173.119 --> 1180.4599999999998
related going on for them how did this

1176.69 --> 1180.46
thing establish and

1184.98 --> 1195.179
I also love to dig a little deeper in

1189.66 --> 1197.97
the the Hindu religion as well and maybe

1195.179 --> 1201.48
other religions also get some real

1197.97 --> 1203.6100000000001
religious expertise involved to figure

1201.48 --> 1205.049
out things about cosmo jeanine for

1203.61 --> 1209.34
example what they say about the

1205.049 --> 1213.87
supernatural beings and like map it out

1209.34 --> 1216.3899999999999
and just compare it all and this kind of

1213.87 --> 1219.7199999999998
thing has already been done for certain

1216.39 --> 1222.3300000000002
things like comparing the the Christ

1219.72 --> 1224.07
figure or the Sun figure you know the

1222.33 --> 1228.6899999999998
plenty of that kind of thing that you

1224.07 --> 1231.27
can do that but also with just the the

1228.69 --> 1234.54
creatures and the spirit creatures and

1231.27 --> 1236.97
the gods that are around that anything

1234.54 --> 1240.0
that's been mentioned to exist and has

1236.97 --> 1241.6200000000001
been described in all these religions

1240.0 --> 1243.75
and just place it all together like

1241.62 --> 1245.07
which one is which is it really all the

1243.75 --> 1248.299
same thing but from a different

1245.07 --> 1252.1789999999999
perspective from a different culture or

1248.299 --> 1256.1689999999999
are there like weeds you know unique

1252.179 --> 1258.75
things going on that just happened in

1256.169 --> 1260.4
that region for some reason with the

1258.75 --> 1262.559
religions that are there and recognize

1260.4 --> 1266.16
these things or spirits or whatever it's

1262.559 --> 1272.46
gonna be just love to talk about that I

1266.16 --> 1276.419
want to know more so any experts in the

1272.46 --> 1279.54
Hindu scripts and all that or anyone

1276.419 --> 1282.1200000000001
willing to talk about philosophy

1279.54 --> 1286.98
concerning life after death

1282.12 --> 1289.1999999999998
reincarnation or going to heaven from a

1286.98 --> 1292.049
Christian perspective or in a new

1289.2 --> 1293.309
perspective love to convey a little bit

1292.049 --> 1299.94
more about that as well

1293.309 --> 1302.22
like see what people think about it and

1299.94 --> 1304.98
what they are contemplating and how they

1302.22 --> 1310.83
approach it love to see that love to

1304.98 --> 1313.53
hear about it so yeah if you if you're

1310.83 --> 1315.87
seeing this video afterwards online

1313.53 --> 1318.23
bumping into it yeah

1315.87 --> 1321.6299999999999
please contact me on skype

1318.23 --> 1325.6200000000001
it's you can see it in the description

1321.63 --> 1334.3200000000002
box of this video just look or just

1325.62 --> 1339.03
search on a RW y & 7 so another I J like

1334.32 --> 1342.08
my name is but with why is it second

1339.03 --> 1347.16
last letter of the alphabet just a nano

1342.08 --> 1349.11
so ya add me then I'd love to have a

1347.16 --> 1351.3300000000002
conversation you don't have to like

1349.11 --> 1353.3899999999999
first contact appear on the show or

1351.33 --> 1356.9099999999999
anything we could just talk on skype

1353.39 --> 1359.76
offline in text or in video chat if you

1356.91 --> 1362.0400000000002
like and yeah hey you know if you feel

1359.76 --> 1364.8
like it come on the show sometime or

1362.04 --> 1368.7
even become a regular guest if you

1364.8 --> 1371.1
really want to find me I got a lot of

1368.7 --> 1374.1000000000001
time a lot of room don't necessarily

1371.1 --> 1376.56
want to be talking by myself most of the

1374.1 --> 1378.6499999999999
time during the show but if it happens

1376.56 --> 1396.4199999999998
it happens and if I got something to say

1378.65 --> 1404.6100000000001
then I'm gonna say it that's all hey

1396.42 --> 1410.04
hello Travis hey Arwen oh yeah yeah can

1404.61 --> 1413.1299999999999
hear you are you doing I'm just working

1410.04 --> 1418.44
on some some of my leftover footage from

1413.13 --> 1422.43
California sorry you know what I'm just

1418.44 --> 1424.8
working on some of my left over oil rig

1422.43 --> 1426.3
footage that I've been putting up I'm

1424.8 --> 1431.03
trying to go trying to go through the

1426.3 --> 1431.03
videos that I haven't processed yet I

1432.23 --> 1437.18
usually I usually can't multitask so

1435.12 --> 1439.6499999999999
that's why I didn't jump on right away

1437.18 --> 1441.6000000000001
alright well I started the half-hour

1439.65 --> 1446.67
early anyway so you're still gonna be

1441.6 --> 1450.73
things so so what have you been talking

1446.67 --> 1454.96
about general stuff

1450.73 --> 1461.559
usual conversation with the guy I newly

1454.96 --> 1463.33
met who was pretty open then yeah it's

1461.559 --> 1466.54
very difficult like yeah meeting a new

1463.33 --> 1471.73
person but I could figure out that he

1466.54 --> 1473.47
was he had a lot of moral feelings a lot

1471.73 --> 1475.39
of frustrations with society and they

1473.47 --> 1477.76
basically noticed that he didn't really

1475.39 --> 1481.3300000000002
understand why things work that they did

1477.76 --> 1483.549
as they did and failed from a look from

1481.33 --> 1487.299
a personal logical perspective so I

1483.549 --> 1490.57
helped him to try and look a little bit

1487.299 --> 1492.25
deeper what I typically do to see why

1490.57 --> 1495.6689999999999
things are the way they are that there's

1492.25 --> 1497.95
a reason behind why it is functioning or

1495.669 --> 1500.0490000000002
apparently misfunctioning and explain

1497.95 --> 1503.95
some things and I think he got it

1500.049 --> 1508.95
that was interesting and that also

1503.95 --> 1508.95
talked a little bit about the whole

1509.22 --> 1513.79
perspective thing going on and the

1511.809 --> 1516.97
optical slant and obstruction and the

1513.79 --> 1521.5
viewing function this been recycling now

1516.97 --> 1523.9
for weeks but it is retaining its power

1521.5 --> 1526.15
you can just keep on hammering with it

1523.9 --> 1528.1000000000001
and even depth deepening the

1526.15 --> 1531.25
understanding deepening the explanations

1528.1 --> 1536.1399999999999
because this is just such a massive win

1531.25 --> 1541.2
and talk to a little bit about how I

1536.14 --> 1544.21
think that in schools people should be

1541.2 --> 1546.79
taught about the viewing function about

1544.21 --> 1549.58
diffraction and have a demonstrated to

1546.79 --> 1552.3999999999999
them at between the ages of 8 and 12

1549.58 --> 1553.809
somewhere in school should be not

1552.4 --> 1555.4
necessarily about the shape of the earth

1553.809 --> 1558.04
but just like yeah look we're gonna

1555.4 --> 1560.95
about basic physics optics look that

1558.04 --> 1564.46
fraction this is how it works see ya in

1560.95 --> 1567.49
the formula right if that's done then

1564.46 --> 1569.26
it's done then that then people will

1567.49 --> 1571.69
have this knowledge from school and

1569.26 --> 1574.27
every time somebody talks about over the

1571.69 --> 1578.3200000000002
curvature whatever then they will have

1574.27 --> 1580.6589999999999
it too yeah basically respond with

1578.32 --> 1583.24
whether they choose to or not as another

1580.659 --> 1584.679
matter but they won't be blank and like

1583.24 --> 1586.419
okay I guess it must

1584.679 --> 1591.49
buta curvature because there is nothing

1586.419 --> 1594.22
else I know so yeah I think though that

1591.49 --> 1595.99
you have to you have to show your hand

1594.22 --> 1598.48
though I think that if you put it into

1595.99 --> 1600.039
the context of Flat Earth it would

1598.48 --> 1601.1490000000001
actually be quite interesting for

1600.039 --> 1604.69
someone to consider it but if you just

1601.149 --> 1607.57
come at it from a natural phenomenon

1604.69 --> 1610.289
natural physics the way we see things I

1607.57 --> 1612.7
don't think people are going to be as

1610.289 --> 1616.179
readily interested in it so if I think

1612.7 --> 1620.44
back to my own education with history or

1616.179 --> 1625.21
why not why isn't it fascinating that it

1620.44 --> 1628.6000000000001
works that way well Peirce like over

1625.21 --> 1631.3600000000001
flame how lift the table or a grounds

1628.6 --> 1632.889
you know listen I agree with you but I

1631.36 --> 1635.1999999999998
can only agree with you right now

1632.889 --> 1639.07
because of my previous experience when I

1635.2 --> 1640.6000000000001
didn't give a [ __ ] but now when I'm

1639.07 --> 1643.35
looking at it from the way that we're

1640.6 --> 1645.639
talking about it I'm I'm absolutely

1643.35 --> 1648.309
interested in entry but I'm saying if

1645.639 --> 1651.49
you'd go to a middle schooler or if you

1648.309 --> 1653.83
go to a middle you know thirteen year

1651.49 --> 1655.45
olds a classroom a thirteen year olds

1653.83 --> 1657.99
and you just start talking science

1655.45 --> 1660.8790000000001
there's gonna be two of them who care

1657.99 --> 1662.47
because they like science now those are

1660.879 --> 1665.049
gonna be like I don't care about this

1662.47 --> 1667.6000000000001
this is stupid but if you go but if you

1665.049 --> 1669.759
if you show your hand and say okay

1667.6 --> 1675.2489999999998
everybody this is important because

1669.759 --> 1679.779
people think the earth is flat and yeah

1675.249 --> 1683.46
but no but it that's nice if Flat Earth

1679.779 --> 1687.7
can get a place but if you just let

1683.46 --> 1690.3990000000001
diffraction in and don't involve Flat

1687.7 --> 1694.779
Earth or the globe then it is just a

1690.399 --> 1697.4189999999999
fact we're adding and we can still use

1694.779 --> 1701.559
that step up it's going to be much

1697.419 --> 1707.94
easier to apply this because it is just

1701.559 --> 1710.71
a non political fact I appreciate your I

1707.94 --> 1713.3790000000001
think that if we come up with this and

1710.71 --> 1716.32
don't even don't even use the word Flat

1713.379 --> 1717.4289999999999
Earth in our approach of whoever we're

1716.32 --> 1718.1299999999999
gonna approach the government or

1717.429 --> 1720.5600000000002
whatever

1718.13 --> 1722.2700000000002
we're gonna do that that this can I just

1720.56 --> 1725.9199999999998
work like you had the fraction it's the

1722.27 --> 1725.92
thing it should be taught in school just

1726.91 --> 1731.48
maybe if just an hour just like oh yeah

1729.92 --> 1734.45
let's talk about that fraction for a

1731.48 --> 1738.74
moment it's not the core fact see this

1734.45 --> 1743.45
is it that's it that's enough for a net

1738.74 --> 1748.82
for now of course then once we really

1743.45 --> 1750.71
get the to allow flat earth or a flat

1748.82 --> 1753.59
earth concept to compete with the

1750.71 --> 1755.27
cosmogony of the globe yeah that's a

1753.59 --> 1757.37
whole different chapter but that's so

1755.27 --> 1759.73
heavy but if people already know about

1757.37 --> 1763.07
that fraction then it's very easy for

1759.73 --> 1766.07
flat earth law to basically yeah and see

1763.07 --> 1770.6899999999998
the fraction it's there you already

1766.07 --> 1772.97
learn about it and this is what we see

1770.69 --> 1777.3500000000001
in the horizon and it's not curvature

1772.97 --> 1778.82
see and they already have the tool if we

1777.35 --> 1780.1999999999998
they weren't taught about it's all gonna

1778.82 --> 1781.73
be new like em what are you talking

1780.2 --> 1783.71
about it's going to be very comfortable

1781.73 --> 1787.01
by weren't we taught about this is this

1783.71 --> 1790.43
real what is this why isn't why do we

1787.01 --> 1793.28
now get to learn about it in context

1790.43 --> 1795.5
with Flat Earth feels off why they

1793.28 --> 1797.51
should learn about it separately because

1795.5 --> 1799.46
it is a thing and you can demonstrate it

1797.51 --> 1802.01
and just let it sink in for the fact

1799.46 --> 1805.33
that it is and not immediately tied in

1802.01 --> 1810.46
with such a loaded subject as flatter

1805.33 --> 1810.46
see ya

1812.29 --> 1824.2
anyway that's my case being for but

1820.03 --> 1824.2
we'll see when we get there

1827.82 --> 1833.3999999999999
although I think that for example if

1830.88 --> 1837.18
you're going to be an engineer

1833.4 --> 1840.1200000000001
concerning optics and or like the person

1837.18 --> 1841.6200000000001
that would make lenses glass lenses and

1840.12 --> 1843.51
and that kind of thing you would

1841.62 --> 1845.55
absolutely know about diffraction you

1843.51 --> 1852.24
would have to know about it because it

1845.55 --> 1856.62
is a part of optics off lens design but

1852.24 --> 1863.49
yeah you'd get to learn that pretty late

1856.62 --> 1866.01
on as again as specialist knowledge so

1863.49 --> 1867.63
that's that's not the same as when you

1866.01 --> 1871.44
get to learn it from a very simple

1867.63 --> 1874.0800000000002
common knowledge perspective so they'll

1871.44 --> 1876.3
be less likely to bring it up because

1874.08 --> 1878.07
they will have the expert view and you

1876.3 --> 1881.01
have to be a really good person in

1878.07 --> 1883.32
translating language levels you have to

1881.01 --> 1885.48
be good at explaining to actually

1883.32 --> 1887.04
translate that professional high-level

1885.48 --> 1889.5
knowledge and everything that's tied

1887.04 --> 1891.93
into it into a simplified version that

1889.5 --> 1893.67
some common person can understand not

1891.93 --> 1895.38
everyone can do that you know a lot of

1893.67 --> 1897.78
people can learn stuff really well but

1895.38 --> 1901.0100000000002
they don't necessarily know how to

1897.78 --> 1905.73
explain it to a common person very well

1901.01 --> 1909.33
that's a skill on its own not everybody

1905.73 --> 1917.55
has that skill right not everyone can be

1909.33 --> 1918.87
a teacher so that's why I think ya

1917.55 --> 1923.43
introduced it early on

1918.87 --> 1928.26
let it be common knowledge and it is not

1923.43 --> 1930.45
that complex really it is a little bit

1928.26 --> 1934.92
more extensive than other common

1930.45 --> 1937.74
knowledge I guess but just gets the time

1934.92 --> 1942.5700000000002
and gets explained properly yeah then it

1937.74 --> 1944.61
will get a place you can remember it you

1942.57 --> 1950.1499999999999
go have some references and school books

1944.61 --> 1954.11
and everything in mine so

1950.15 --> 1955.8200000000002
talk I'm old you I'm distracted I'm

1954.11 --> 1961.61
doing my stuff so I'm listening to you

1955.82 --> 1963.95
but I I'm a distraction I'm the

1961.61 --> 1965.6299999999999
distraction conspiracy yes you are the

1963.95 --> 1973.1000000000001
distraction that's why I usually don't

1965.63 --> 1974.75
call it yeah oh yeah me night you know I

1973.1 --> 1977.27
basically already said what I what I

1974.75 --> 1978.8
thought in terms of I mean I I agree

1977.27 --> 1982.07
with you

1978.8 --> 1984.2
conceptually in terms of talking about

1982.07 --> 1986.51
the way that we see things in the way

1984.2 --> 1993.3500000000001
that optics work and things like that I

1986.51 --> 1995.21
agree I just have a I think just again

1993.35 --> 1998.2099999999998
my own experience in being interested in

1995.21 --> 2001.15
something just in terms of it being a

1998.21 --> 2004.02
bare back you know but if we look at

2001.15 --> 2006.88
history as bare facts I could care less

2004.02 --> 2011.7
but if we start talking about history as

2006.88 --> 2016.63
conspiracy yeah that's interesting true

2011.7 --> 2020.05
absolutely it's kind of funny how that

2016.63 --> 2022.45
works yeah you know that's what do I

2020.05 --> 2025.06
care modern-day conspiracies have

2022.45 --> 2029.91
actually flared up the public interest

2025.06 --> 2032.47
in it isn't that ironic yeah I mean I

2029.91 --> 2033.8500000000001
look like well 9/11 now there's

2032.47 --> 2036.88
something so wrong with this and then

2033.85 --> 2038.4399999999998
like hmm remember JFK oh wait what

2036.88 --> 2040.45
happened over there and then oh my god

2038.44 --> 2044.77
the 20th century is like full with false

2040.45 --> 2047.65
flags right right we didn't really know

2044.77 --> 2050.74
that yeah nobody wanted to know that

2047.65 --> 2053.169
yeah it's a huge puzzle you can

2050.74 --> 2055.6899999999996
introduce false flags into your history

2053.169 --> 2058.6299999999997
class and I think that you'll get off a

2055.69 --> 2060.429
lot a different reaction to your

2058.63 --> 2065.61
information you'll get full classes

2060.429 --> 2065.61
that's right absolutely stuffed

2068.29 --> 2075.909
what be kind of good to actually do that

2070.899 --> 2079.96
I think although he had corporations

2075.909 --> 2082.4500000000003
ones like it and neither will the banks

2079.96 --> 2086.76
so it's kind of things are gonna have to

2082.45 --> 2086.7599999999998
change before that will actually happen

2090.75 --> 2099.55
yeah Nathan already went live so I think

2096.79 --> 2104.35
I'm gonna end the show a little bit

2099.55 --> 2106.9
early as well okay all right we'll catch

2104.35 --> 2112.69
you over there are would yes so yeah a

2106.9 --> 2116.26
short show today next week on Monday I'm

2112.69 --> 2118.48
probably gonna start a one hour early as

2116.26 --> 2120.55
I do usual and just have a full hour

2118.48 --> 2125.29
really earning some money is gonna be

2120.55 --> 2127.57
really really early what don't worry

2125.29 --> 2132.0099999999998
it's gonna be very early but we're gonna

2127.57 --> 2134.56
be talking about smooth and interesting

2132.01 --> 2139.3900000000003
subjects that you can just calmly eat

2134.56 --> 2145.0
your breakfast on and that's it all

2139.39 --> 2148.6
stressed out so I see it I see you there

2145.0 --> 2149.32
on the debate strands so thanks everyone

2148.6 --> 2151.9
for coming

2149.32 --> 2155.9100000000003
it says yeah everyone did show up pretty

2151.9 --> 2155.9100000000003
early so that's nice good to see and

2156.0 --> 2163.21
