at the normal height the audio input

219.6 --> 242.79
I don't know that is all what okay right

237.54 --> 246.66
in the in the in the advanced properties

242.79 --> 249.269
in OBS it said it was a 10 decibel but

246.66 --> 252.66
it wasn't and then I actually had to

249.269 --> 255.15
reset it in there and now I could put it

252.66 --> 260.57
back so the volume should be up to back

255.15 --> 264.41
to normal levels now sort of I think no

260.57 --> 264.40999999999997
it's still low Oh

265.93 --> 285.83
okay okay right anyway yeah good to see

271.37 --> 292.16
you all yeah yesterday was a pretty

285.83 --> 295.88
intense day for me let's see what

292.16 --> 298.84000000000003
happened right so yeah of course I did

295.88 --> 305.3
early-bird I watched watch part of it I

298.84 --> 310.36999999999995
was good then I went on the debates and

305.3 --> 312.86
was okay I wasn't super active I went

310.37 --> 317.75
for groceries and then eventually went

312.86 --> 318.44
for my newspaper rounds then when I came

317.75 --> 322.87
back

318.44 --> 328.36
dr. hanger was sort of over and I got in

322.87 --> 331.9
after stopped recording and I kind of

328.36 --> 334.73
yeah something special happened so

331.9 --> 337.94
yesterday in the afternoon somewhere my

334.73 --> 341.51
healer called me try to call him for

337.94 --> 343.46
like a week because I've had issues and

341.51 --> 346.61
he has been too busy but he called me

343.46 --> 349.58
back and what checked me out and there

346.61 --> 352.94
were all kinds of issues but here comes

349.58 --> 357.71
the big part and yeah I tried to relay

352.94 --> 360.29
this as good as I can even like massive

357.71 --> 362.27
enthusiasm to the Flat Earth some of the

360.29 --> 366.41
flatter debate panel including Nathan

362.27 --> 374.41999999999996
and John was in there and I wasn't

366.41 --> 376.40000000000003
really received well what are you

374.42 --> 377.36
talking about Tom Parker I have no idea

376.4 --> 379.04999999999995
what you're talking about

377.36 --> 383.58000000000004
but

379.05 --> 388.169
right it seems that last Sunday

383.58 --> 394.029
something really really special happened

388.169 --> 399.279
in concerning my spirit and even that of

394.029 --> 401.529
my dad's and it explains a lot a lot of

399.279 --> 403.86899999999997
what has happened even in the evening

401.529 --> 406.289
then remember because Sunday night I got

403.869 --> 409.65900000000005
really sick and it was all surprised

406.289 --> 414.729
like why did I suddenly get this

409.659 --> 416.74
response to to the absence alcohol and I

414.729 --> 419.37899999999996
know that's kind of like a a loaded

416.74 --> 422.259
substance it's shouldn't be taking it

419.379 --> 425.589
but I had his the extreme reaction to it

422.259 --> 427.119
and days after I even shared on the

425.589 --> 431.289
hangout like what what's going on my

427.119 --> 435.84900000000005
things seemed I get these things changed

431.289 --> 438.49
like why am I suddenly drawn towards

435.849 --> 440.769
certain types of food when I've always

438.49 --> 444.339
avoided that like I never like that and

440.769 --> 446.979
now it's things have changed well yeah

444.339 --> 448.86899999999997
things have changed and I didn't know it

446.979 --> 451.50899999999996
and I already felt and I already

448.869 --> 456.519
underwent it okay this is big this is

451.509 --> 458.889
not some temporary measure this is well

456.519 --> 461.619
you could say life contract issues big

458.889 --> 464.729
no and hello Karen B yeah thank you

461.619 --> 469.02900000000005
thank you Karen B by the way for the

464.729 --> 472.719
PayPal donation can be yeah forty euros

469.029 --> 479.439
is huge and thank you so much I really

472.719 --> 481.899
can use that and yeah thank you so much

479.439 --> 484.089
for that so shout out to Karen B and her

481.899 --> 485.709
channel and she does some amazing stream

484.089 --> 488.319
so if you haven't already subscribed to

485.709 --> 491.74
Karen B but anyway after after that

488.319 --> 493.449
wrote in with the I'm gonna elaborate on

491.74 --> 498.149
what exactly happens I'm gonna keep it a

493.449 --> 498.149
little bit of mist it's big for me so

499.229 --> 504.849
after that run-in I got really pissed

502.029 --> 507.33
off at the panel and I I kind of like

504.849 --> 510.569
put down

507.33 --> 518.0989999999999
my borders said like yeah I'm not taking

510.569 --> 521.099
this [ __ ] anymore and some things have

518.099 --> 525.51
changed have changed concerning me I've

521.099 --> 527.5500000000001
been falling falling I've allowed myself

525.51 --> 529.769
to get into certain positions into

527.55 --> 532.529
certain social positions into certain

529.769 --> 535.86
roles and I'm very eloquent at them but

532.529 --> 539.7
I can't do that anymore because I've

535.86 --> 543.54
changed big and I explained it to care

539.7 --> 546.4200000000001
and B and she got it I think and yeah

543.54 --> 549.4499999999999
Karen B is an actual spiritual person

546.42 --> 554.64
not in a superficial hippie-dippie way

549.45 --> 560.9590000000001
and she got it so so let me get to what

554.64 --> 563.51
that was all right apparently

560.959 --> 565.3199999999999
considering the the the vast

563.51 --> 568.2
complications the spiritual

565.32 --> 570.0600000000001
complications within my family and that

568.2 --> 572.3100000000001
probably reaches into the past even

570.06 --> 574.77
because I told you already like my my

572.31 --> 577.2299999999999
grandfather my mother's side was a

574.77 --> 579.5699999999999
freemason my mother never knew him

577.23 --> 584.279
literally like when people she was five

579.57 --> 588.3900000000001
he abandoned her and so there's like a

584.279 --> 591.24
cascade of family issues like friction

588.39 --> 595.43
between the generations that was kind of

591.24 --> 599.5790000000001
part of what I appeared into as a person

595.43 --> 604.079
where I was someone that and with my

599.579 --> 606.3
birth something happened like

604.079 --> 608.399
spiritually it is what happens when

606.3 --> 610.4699999999999
somebody new appears especially in the

608.399 --> 613.339
future in a spiritual family where

610.47 --> 615.99
energies are strong and there's issues

613.339 --> 619.6800000000001
when somebody appears in between them

615.99 --> 623.63
and entangles the the balance shifts and

619.68 --> 625.8599999999999
things happen so what happened is that

623.63 --> 629.01
the moment I was born

625.86 --> 631.8000000000001
suddenly there was a shift and I pray

629.01 --> 633.959
you could I could argue spiritually

631.8 --> 636.0889999999999
economy gets this that I might actually

633.959 --> 637.18
have been summoned for this specific

636.089 --> 640.3900000000001
reason

637.18 --> 644.89
that's part of why I came into being so

640.39 --> 649.4499999999999
what happened is my dad the moment I was

644.89 --> 652.27
born basically got an Iranian strike on

649.45 --> 654.61
him but it's very complicated it's not

652.27 --> 657.97
just some random basic attack no it was

654.61 --> 662.17
basically probably contracted with the

657.97 --> 663.1800000000001
creator himself as in that he directed

662.17 --> 667.2099999999999
this to happen

663.18 --> 669.31
some is something special right because

667.21 --> 671.02
what happened specifically and now we're

669.31 --> 675.7299999999999
gonna get into chakras for a moment I

671.02 --> 678.13
don't do that often but my dad's 7th

675.73 --> 679.99
chakra which is the crown chakra and

678.13 --> 682.48
it's also the connection with the 8th

679.99 --> 687.1
chakra D the higher self

682.48 --> 689.9200000000001
it got clamped now what this means is it

687.1 --> 693.16
didn't get destroyed it just got from

689.92 --> 695.0799999999999
the other side somebody put a yeah a

693.16 --> 698.53
spiritual mechanical clamp on it

695.08 --> 702.61
tightening the chakra not allowing

698.53 --> 705.37
energy to be transferred through that in

702.61 --> 706.51
the normal chain of chakra energy

705.37 --> 708.01
processes

706.51 --> 710.28
Chad froze again thank you for pointing

708.01 --> 710.28
that out

716.75 --> 725.72
all right thank you so what that does is

722.259 --> 728.029
it's very difficult to exactly explain

725.72 --> 733.22
what this is especially to people that

728.029 --> 735.439
are not studied in chakras but I'm gonna

733.22 --> 737.36
try it anyway so what happens when that

735.439 --> 743.949
happens when they said the crown chakra

737.36 --> 751.149
is closed off you kind of bypass the

743.949 --> 754.3389999999999
world.the the self and it it makes you

751.149 --> 758.269
unconnected - to your very personal

754.339 --> 760.5500000000001
purpose in the world and it kind of sets

758.269 --> 763.129
you adrift in a way but there there's

760.55 --> 765.3499999999999
all kinds of processes that then the

763.129 --> 768.009
body and the individual with that crown

765.35 --> 772.4300000000001
chakra shot will start to do as to

768.009 --> 774.5
bypass this problem and it results in to

772.43 --> 776.66
all kind doing things mentally and

774.5 --> 778.49
developing certain type of types of

776.66 --> 780.439
skills will typically result from it

778.49 --> 785.199
yeah it's complicated okay

780.439 --> 790.519
so this clamp has been on my dad very

785.199 --> 792.17
very long time pretty much 40 years 40

790.519 --> 796.49
years probably

792.17 --> 798.92
- the second last Sunday it's time

796.49 --> 803.589
involved it's this is very very

798.92 --> 806.18
remarkable to me and that was there it

803.589 --> 808.25
resulted in kind of phase the the

806.18 --> 810.62
practical result of the chakra being

808.25 --> 813.35
closed within the family setting is you

810.62 --> 815.559
need that my father stepped away he was

813.35 --> 819.379
all you always wanted to be alone and

815.559 --> 821.569
nobody got that and we were angry at I

819.379 --> 823.37
was angry at him for that because he

821.569 --> 825.41
seemed like he just didn't want to be

823.37 --> 830.569
part of the family but it's a side

825.41 --> 833.7199999999999
effect of that that he just kept looking

830.569 --> 836.569
he lost his self

833.72 --> 840.4390000000001
it was unconnected so he was like trying

836.569 --> 843.319
to find himself at it at a pretty late

840.439 --> 847.009
age it was in his 20s but he lost

843.319 --> 848.0899999999999
himself through me did your birthday

847.009 --> 849.77
just now

848.09 --> 853.2800000000001
no that doesn't have to do with my

849.77 --> 858.38
birthday its with the moment probably I

853.28 --> 863.75
was conceived yeah sort of

858.38 --> 865.46
I don't know sorry it's not super look

863.75 --> 867.2
there may be like it six months the

865.46 --> 869.84
deviation I don't know but it's pretty

867.2 --> 871.82
much on the year the Year Ike was

869.84 --> 874.58
conceived it seems my dad had this

871.82 --> 876.8900000000001
effect subjected to him like a life

874.58 --> 879.47
contract that is nobody really

876.89 --> 881.53
understands stood why it just happened

879.47 --> 891.6800000000001
and it changed the setting in my family

881.53 --> 895.52
then when I was 17 I was probably vast I

891.68 --> 897.3499999999999
had massive and yes I told everyone here

895.52 --> 900.77
even in my earlier descriptions like

897.35 --> 903.9200000000001
yeah I was almost like megalomania was

900.77 --> 906.29
taking me because I felt so strong and

903.92 --> 912.26
confident incredible I thought like this

906.29 --> 915.98
I am I felt like I'm a god I must do as

912.26 --> 918.2
God like I wanted to do good but it was

915.98 --> 920.0
just like I was very young didn't

918.2 --> 923.45
understand things I still didn't

920.0 --> 926.87
understand illusions but that energy was

923.45 --> 930.1400000000001
there and then I got caught I of the

926.87 --> 934.4
Jesuit guy and he is contracted on the

930.14 --> 936.65
dark side pretty damn sure he is and he

934.4 --> 939.5
basically started working on me until

936.65 --> 941.87
the moment where the massive vision came

939.5 --> 948.14
into being when I was subjected to the

941.87 --> 951.95
ayahuasca and then roughly in 99 which

948.14 --> 955.9399999999999
is 20 years later from when I was

951.95 --> 958.33
conceived I was subjected to a massive

955.94 --> 962.1500000000001
clamp I was subjected to a brutal

958.33 --> 964.3100000000001
illusion literally tortured by demons in

962.15 --> 968.26
my spirit on the other side without

964.31 --> 971.81
being able to guard myself against it

968.26 --> 974.81
for a massive time it is a you know it's

971.81 --> 976.1899999999999
crazy this I really wonder how I survive

974.81 --> 982.7589999999999
this

976.19 --> 985.25
and during the process visually and I

982.759 --> 989.779
remember this and I had relayed this to

985.25 --> 991.639
my healer her Eman in a personification

989.779 --> 994.67
of an in the man in black with the beard

991.639 --> 997.04
and the glasses very specific very

994.67 --> 998.99
specific images keep some coming back

997.04 --> 1002.379
although even though the original image

998.99 --> 1004.889
that was based on that person that the

1002.379 --> 1007.48
eye Riemann personification eventually

1004.889 --> 1013.54
personified as is probably dead

1007.48 --> 1017.019
right but that figure put a clamp on me

1013.54 --> 1021.73
and I even know how I remember it I saw

1017.019 --> 1025.9
it and he said to me he stood before me

1021.73 --> 1029.8600000000001
looked at me and said he put his hand

1025.9 --> 1033.929
above my head like like this like this I

1029.86 --> 1037.1789999999999
said you don't need that and I was like

1033.929 --> 1040.63
okay something is being taken from me

1037.179 --> 1042.909
but I don't feel anything I don't

1040.63 --> 1045.5490000000002
understand what just happened could be

1042.909 --> 1047.8600000000001
because of the shock it was already kind

1045.549 --> 1049.809
of shuddered I was very confused so I

1047.86 --> 1051.549
did notice the different I didn't notice

1049.809 --> 1055.23
that it was kind of permanently clamped

1051.549 --> 1060.429
why did he felt the end result of that

1055.23 --> 1066.96
starting to feel lost and that has been

1060.429 --> 1069.96
on me since last Sunday for 20 years

1066.96 --> 1069.96
roughly

1071.24 --> 1078.23
and even the October matches up because

1076.429 --> 1082.49
that is what I've kind of remembered

1078.23 --> 1085.88
being I guess it was October 15 makes a

1082.49 --> 1088.73
lot of sense that October it's always

1085.88 --> 1093.23
like energetically highlighted for me

1088.73 --> 1096.049
that something core important was there

1093.23 --> 1097.01
for me anyway this clamp has been

1096.049 --> 1100.429
released to me

1097.01 --> 1103.549
and from me after 20 years and I had to

1100.429 --> 1106.3300000000002
probably go through that I I talked with

1103.549 --> 1109.6689999999999
this off with my healer I have developed

1106.33 --> 1113.26
amazing skills because probably of my

1109.669 --> 1118.929
best talents by passing the crown chakra

1113.26 --> 1125.75
right by passing it I've had amazing

1118.929 --> 1129.1100000000001
visual acuity and instinctual strength

1125.75 --> 1131.419
despite the crown chakra basically not

1129.11 --> 1133.51
being there so I almost completely

1131.419 --> 1137.8700000000001
bypassed it and it made it almost

1133.51 --> 1141.289
invisible even my healer hasn't seen it

1137.87 --> 1144.7299999999998
it was only because for some reason it

1141.289 --> 1148.76
was revealed to him last Sunday as

1144.73 --> 1150.44
almost like it was green lighted like it

1148.76 --> 1152.33
was green light and that's what he said

1150.44 --> 1154.7
to me like suddenly it was pointed out

1152.33 --> 1158.0
to him with with my dad like there's a

1154.7 --> 1163.8500000000001
clamp there and it's time to release it

1158.0 --> 1166.19
because my healer like he doesn't yeah

1163.85 --> 1168.9499999999998
it's not like he's using a scanner and

1166.19 --> 1170.3300000000002
you can exactly see you know like Star

1168.95 --> 1176.24
Trek you know this is wrong that's wrong

1170.33 --> 1179.4499999999998
no it he visualizes it and things are

1176.24 --> 1185.57
told to him by his assistants on the

1179.45 --> 1187.549
other side his helpers guides and they

1185.57 --> 1189.59
just they have rules they're bound by

1187.549 --> 1193.1299999999999
rules say they remind me of angels he

1189.59 --> 1197.51
doesn't literally see them never but

1193.13 --> 1199.279
they do communicate and it seems it was

1197.51 --> 1201.86
green lighted funnily enough you know

1199.279 --> 1203.87
and just the side effect I think that

1201.86 --> 1209.03
I'm not the only one I think

1203.87 --> 1213.6799999999998
is a massive mass spread contractual

1209.03 --> 1216.11
release moment like a moment in time

1213.68 --> 1218.78
where suddenly a lot of people and kind

1216.11 --> 1220.6399999999999
of their fields are being lifted because

1218.78 --> 1224.03
I don't know if they're gonna have

1220.64 --> 1227.95
exactly this similar effect but what it

1224.03 --> 1235.09
has resulted with me and staggering

1227.95 --> 1239.99
because I feel completely different I

1235.09 --> 1245.1499999999999
feel kind of like what it felt like when

1239.99 --> 1248.72
I was 17 I have no more nausea not even

1245.15 --> 1252.8600000000001
a hint not even a trace my intestines

1248.72 --> 1255.8
are kids can't feel them anymore they're

1252.86 --> 1264.5
so comfortable and I feel a lot of

1255.8 --> 1267.8899999999999
energy tactile senses have restabilized

1264.5 --> 1270.32
like it's normal that as you grow older

1267.89 --> 1272.929
that your tactile senses kind of can get

1270.32 --> 1275.09
a little warped due to deterioration

1272.929 --> 1278.71
over - it seems like I've been almost

1275.09 --> 1283.309
completely reset I don't feel old

1278.71 --> 1286.04
anymore and also it just feels different

1283.309 --> 1290.17
because now there I feel this this is

1286.04 --> 1293.12
this opening here and weirdly enough

1290.17 --> 1295.97
little headache not a lot

1293.12 --> 1298.61
slight headaches and that's unusual for

1295.97 --> 1300.98
me because I've never really had

1298.61 --> 1302.809
headaches in the last 20 years like ever

1300.98 --> 1306.53
I have all kinds of troubles but

1302.809 --> 1309.8799999999999
headaches never so it seems like the

1306.53 --> 1312.74
actual matter they do gray matter is

1309.88 --> 1314.75
needing some getting used to for all

1312.74 --> 1317.23
that energy to suddenly pass through

1314.75 --> 1321.22
where before it hasn't so probably even

1317.23 --> 1324.22
disrupting some some structures

1321.22 --> 1326.54
partially but at the same time

1324.22 --> 1330.26
everything is falling into place I've

1326.54 --> 1334.06
done so many things to reroute a kind of

1330.26 --> 1336.98
like accommodate for the loss of energy

1334.06 --> 1338.78
through the last 20 years and down

1336.98 --> 1341.3600000000001
pretty damn well if I say so that's

1338.78 --> 1348.6499999999999
suddenly now being subjected to the fall

1341.36 --> 1354.049
blow it is an experience I ate it's like

1348.65 --> 1357.26
really heavy and also realizations I no

1354.049 --> 1361.76
longer have a tolerance lemon not like

1357.26 --> 1363.98
before the situation for example what

1361.76 --> 1368.809
happened to me at the Amsterdam

1363.98 --> 1371.27
conference where I would get mmm feeble

1368.809 --> 1374.51
and just at some point wouldn't be able

1371.27 --> 1378.02
to handle anymore and got sick that was

1374.51 --> 1380.84
I know I feel that that is tied in

1378.02 --> 1382.8799999999999
specifically with that mechanic with the

1380.84 --> 1386.12
clamp that was there and the limitation

1382.88 --> 1389.2990000000002
of the energy flow it felt literally

1386.12 --> 1392.36
like a a ceiling a limit as to how far I

1389.299 --> 1396.65
could push myself and I feel I suspect

1392.36 --> 1403.1599999999999
and I have to test I no longer have this

1396.65 --> 1411.3500000000001
limitation okay I was feeling adrenaline

1403.16 --> 1419.24
as I say that cuz there is some there

1411.35 --> 1423.5
are some things I need to do thing I can

1419.24 --> 1426.44
do it now have to be careful though not

1423.5 --> 1430.54
to get over enthusiastic not to get

1426.44 --> 1433.4
manic again cuz mania can blind you I

1430.54 --> 1435.82
can't afford to get too drunk on this

1433.4 --> 1439.21
new recovered energy on the sudden

1435.82 --> 1444.32
fountain spring opening up again

1439.21 --> 1447.47
just be careful still take the wisdom I

1444.32 --> 1450.76
gained don't just discard it for the

1447.47 --> 1450.76
energy don't trade it off

1453.39 --> 1459.8700000000001
all right and also I need to take some

1456.15 --> 1462.96
time if there really get to figure out

1459.87 --> 1468.54
how my body works because I respond

1462.96 --> 1472.74
differently it's so weird like cannabis

1468.54 --> 1476.61
I respond differently it doesn't do the

1472.74 --> 1478.92
same thing anymore it's usually it

1476.61 --> 1483.059
always gave me this I explained this

1478.92 --> 1486.0900000000001
many times like 5-10 minutes of slight

1483.059 --> 1489.1789999999999
paranoia or panic effect like slight

1486.09 --> 1494.58
anxiety and then I would recover and

1489.179 --> 1500.6100000000001
relax and I get into the zone the panics

1494.58 --> 1505.4399999999998
not there anymore not a hint and I've

1500.61 --> 1507.36
never experienced this before well maybe

1505.44 --> 1510.24
I have in the in the ultra beginnings

1507.36 --> 1512.4599999999998
like when I originally started at my

1510.24 --> 1517.74
first puff cannabis which was when I was

1512.46 --> 1519.9
15 and then it was like oh trippy and I

1517.74 --> 1523.26
didn't know it was just exploring my

1519.9 --> 1526.25
senses but it's working different and

1523.26 --> 1532.97
also alcohol is working different it's

1526.25 --> 1532.97
up because I seem to be

1536.66 --> 1542.0600000000002
I think what alcohol did practically is

1539.6 --> 1544.82
kind of open the gateway a little bit

1542.06 --> 1547.97
more with a lot of side effects to way

1544.82 --> 1551.8
gateway when you use alcohol and it kind

1547.97 --> 1554.66
of made me experienced as if I were like

1551.8 --> 1557.4199999999998
restored and that wasn't what made it so

1554.66 --> 1561.5600000000002
incredibly gratifying for me even with

1557.42 --> 1563.66
just a little just a little beer it

1561.56 --> 1566.12
would make me almost feel complete and

1563.66 --> 1567.77
that is what somewhat worrisome but at

1566.12 --> 1570.11
least my body didn't build up a lot of

1567.77 --> 1573.5
Tolerance eyes I never over the years

1570.11 --> 1578.24
have needed more alcohol that never was

1573.5 --> 1582.08
required but it doesn't do that anymore

1578.24 --> 1588.14
because it's open so it almost seems

1582.08 --> 1590.8899999999999
like alko is like yeah I don't know it

1588.14 --> 1592.8400000000001
it suddenly doesn't appeal to me as much

1590.89 --> 1596.6200000000001
it's weird

1592.84 --> 1602.3899999999999
everything's changed the way things

1596.62 --> 1604.52
taste even kind of changed it's still

1602.39 --> 1607.67
the same taste it's not like my ease

1604.52 --> 1609.8
what is it my taste buds

1607.67 --> 1611.45
spectrum has somehow been jumbled and

1609.8 --> 1616.3
like lose everything stay for no no no

1611.45 --> 1620.81
no that's not but it's just that it's

1616.3 --> 1624.59
more there's other things now there also

1620.81 --> 1633.56
it's it's quite some getting used to for

1624.59 --> 1635.99
me having this yeah but because I'm now

1633.56 --> 1639.71
conscious of it I can actively explore

1635.99 --> 1642.47
and realize this so yeah let me get back

1639.71 --> 1647.27
to chat after this half hour of rambling

1642.47 --> 1651.02
on I have no idea if any of you even

1647.27 --> 1653.84
listened but I needed to put that out

1651.02 --> 1658.1299999999999
there something special happened and it

1653.84 --> 1660.83
shall not be poo pooed and you will you

1658.13 --> 1665.3500000000001
will feel what I'm talking about

1660.83 --> 1665.35
and there's more even because

1666.26 --> 1672.74
seems to be another side effect to this

1669.39 --> 1677.1000000000001
clamp being unleashed and that is I

1672.74 --> 1678.27
think that the dark roll experience side

1677.1 --> 1685.4699999999998
that I have

1678.27 --> 1690.23
I remember this has been reconnected

1685.47 --> 1693.78
with me and it was fearful of that

1690.23 --> 1698.49
rebellious it experienced it as oh my

1693.78 --> 1703.3799999999999
god I lost it thought that its soul was

1698.49 --> 1707.34
being taken away and it was hurtful but

1703.38 --> 1711.0900000000001
that's because it was the the reduced

1707.34 --> 1713.52
state me it's surreal and it and it is

1711.09 --> 1716.85
my others it is my Higher Self it is

1713.52 --> 1719.07
that part that was isolated and thought

1716.85 --> 1722.6899999999998
it was his own being and was basically

1719.07 --> 1725.49
screwing around and messing it like

1722.69 --> 1728.55
fumbling fumbling heavily he didn't

1725.49 --> 1730.71
understand who I was I threw out the

1728.55 --> 1733.23
vision I couldn't see myself I I

1730.71 --> 1735.1200000000001
couldn't understand who I was in the

1733.23 --> 1737.46
actual time I just saw things around it

1735.12 --> 1740.37
and people I ain't interact very surreal

1737.46 --> 1753.44
but I guess that now it's been reunited

1740.37 --> 1756.2099999999998
with me it has overcome its fear of

1753.44 --> 1759.18
reuniting with me by being reunited with

1756.21 --> 1763.47
it was all very superfluous really

1759.18 --> 1765.8400000000001
effectively for the greater situation

1763.47 --> 1768.63
that experienced that part that side of

1765.84 --> 1770.55
me it was very superfluous I think it's

1768.63 --> 1772.8600000000001
been reunited with me and I almost feel

1770.55 --> 1778.4099999999999
like I can literally communicate with

1772.86 --> 1782.25
myself directly at the other side like

1778.41 --> 1785.0900000000001
it's now finally able to hear my real

1782.25 --> 1785.09
intentions

1787.46 --> 1794.42
and that could potentially mean

1790.16 --> 1798.14
incredible things I have to re-explore

1794.42 --> 1800.27
this I used to do some things with me on

1798.14 --> 1804.3100000000002
the other side as a kid I even though

1800.27 --> 1804.31
people are hang out describe

1804.43 --> 1811.6100000000001
experimented explored and now that I'm

1808.34 --> 1815.59
back in communication I can potentially

1811.61 --> 1818.27
do that again but wisely and not as a Oh

1815.59 --> 1821.81
adventurer I believe the world is all

1818.27 --> 1825.41
good no I know what's out there now and

1821.81 --> 1829.45
I know what the dark world is like and

1825.41 --> 1832.91
what it stands for in the bigger picture

1829.45 --> 1835.88
at least I think I do I'm getting a

1832.91 --> 1839.3300000000002
better picture I'm understanding more so

1835.88 --> 1850.2800000000002
this is a really really heavy time for

1839.33 --> 1852.59
me in a good way in a released way it's

1850.28 --> 1857.3899999999999
funny because there's a certain scene in

1852.59 --> 1864.98
The Lord of the Rings and it reminded me

1857.39 --> 1866.75
a lot about metaphorically that is what

1864.98 --> 1869.9
has happened and let me see if I can

1866.75 --> 1872.09
share that it's five minutes I hope I

1869.9 --> 1874.5700000000002
won't get big issue it I won't play the

1872.09 --> 1874.57
whole thing

1878.37 --> 1883.4399999999998
see now come on

1887.429 --> 1893.3690000000001
yeah okay so see enough the Lord of the

1890.339 --> 1898.129
Rings and let's see if you guys see the

1893.369 --> 1898.129
metaphor of everything I just said okay

1930.549 --> 1950.889
should I welcome you in which this

1946.96 --> 1950.8890000000001
chooses to appear

1968.37 --> 1972.1899999999998
[Music]

1979.26 --> 1982.329
[Music]

1985.57 --> 1988.6599999999999
[Music]

2002.05 --> 2005.1599999999999
[Music]

2010.73 --> 2019.819
[Laughter]

2016.19 --> 2019.819
[Music]

2033.52 --> 2036.52
Ahriman

2044.59 --> 2047.6689999999999
if I go

2094.11 --> 2098.0
that's what it feels like

2127.54 --> 2140.29
all right I think you guys get the point

2132.17 --> 2140.29
I hope I hope you do

2150.22 --> 2154.3799999999997
[Music]

2154.859 --> 2158.88
yeah it is a metaphor

2162.25 --> 2168.52
that's not just an Enlightenment it was

2164.859 --> 2170.5299999999997
the release of the curse the clamp the

2168.52 --> 2175.57
poison Saruman

2170.53 --> 2179.5600000000004
our Iman he did that so long ago late is

2175.57 --> 2188.29
the hour in which it should choose to

2179.56 --> 2192.58
arrive but it did and when it did I feel

2188.29 --> 2195.13
like I'm freaking 70 17 instead of that

2192.58 --> 2197.98
old man that I've described myself as

2195.13 --> 2199.859
feeling a lot of the time despite having

2197.98 --> 2205.89
a relatively young look it's not like

2199.859 --> 2211.89
physically that is what I mean it's big

2205.89 --> 2211.89
to me and I think I'm not the only one

2212.33 --> 2215.52
[Music]

2220.18 --> 2228.0699999999997
so I hope I don't get a strike for this

2223.63 --> 2228.07
but it I needed to share this

2252.98 --> 2261.849
yeah Karen B well you know when I was

2256.76 --> 2265.6400000000003
that age I kind of stumbled after that

2261.849 --> 2267.38
felt broken I thought I was always like

2265.64 --> 2269.9
that that's one of the problems I

2267.38 --> 2273.77
thought like that was destined I'm like

2269.9 --> 2277.339
yeah that was always and now I feel like

2273.77 --> 2279.5
back to then and I've struggled for so

2277.339 --> 2282.46
long 20 years I just thought like I'm

2279.5 --> 2286.0
never gonna get anywhere I'm cursed I'm

2282.46 --> 2290.9900000000002
gonna degenerate and then die horribly

2286.0 --> 2294.19
literally that's that was what what it

2290.99 --> 2297.9199999999996
felt like in the background and I

2294.19 --> 2308.48
stopped listening to that but it's still

2297.92 --> 2311.78
there and now I didn't know what to do

2308.48 --> 2313.4
with my freakin life after I was 19

2311.78 --> 2314.65
literally I didn't know what to do

2313.4 --> 2317.96
didn't-didn't

2314.65 --> 2321.92
jobs made no sense to me I didn't think

2317.96 --> 2324.5
of a career that I was like things like

2321.92 --> 2326.9900000000002
oh maybe an architect or a doctor I

2324.5 --> 2330.44
couldn't handle that the study were not

2326.99 --> 2333.589
I couldn't do that I didn't have the

2330.44 --> 2337.18
energy anymore I felt drained and now

2333.589 --> 2340.609
suddenly well I am 20 years older and

2337.18 --> 2342.0499999999997
now suddenly I have all these things and

2340.609 --> 2344.66
these things that I've learned about

2342.05 --> 2353.5600000000004
society about myself about skills about

2344.66 --> 2353.56
lore and now I can try again

2355.34 --> 2363.06
and I do have things that I liked it I

2358.8 --> 2366.03
like this I kind of do like doing live

2363.06 --> 2372.57
streams and talking about this heavy

2366.03 --> 2376.7400000000002
stuff and I partially did this and went

2372.57 --> 2379.02
full in with my personal psychology

2376.74 --> 2380.4599999999996
which is very risky with fear in the

2379.02 --> 2381.9
background well guess what I'm not

2380.46 --> 2385.82
afraid anymore

2381.9 --> 2390.26
that's gone too I know I can do this and

2385.82 --> 2397.77
I'm not so confident that I can do this

2390.26 --> 2400.59
that there's really nothing gonna hold

2397.77 --> 2405.29
me back from doing exactly what I need

2400.59 --> 2405.29
to do the way I need to do it

2432.33 --> 2443.22
Thank You Katrina Scott Katherine yeah I

2439.52 --> 2446.28
appreciate it it yeah there is a lot of

2443.22 --> 2454.62
just negativity and it's a universal

2446.28 --> 2458.3700000000003
problem and it's been very tough to take

2454.62 --> 2460.8599999999997
the the darkness habits out of my system

2458.37 --> 2464.3599999999997
but I've done it in the last few years

2460.86 --> 2464.36
as actively as possible

2470.96 --> 2476.66
and I think I'm doing pretty well and

2473.18 --> 2480.77
I've got even like the darkness that is

2476.66 --> 2483.89
left there I can more distinguish

2480.77 --> 2490.4
between what is actual just like gamma

2483.89 --> 2492.859
darkness and just they say on earth like

2490.4 --> 2497.329
honor harshness like there's moments for

2492.859 --> 2500.18
to be rough or to be mean if it is

2497.329 --> 2504.3390000000004
properly guided if the purpose is

2500.18 --> 2508.2799999999997
correct and if there's no brokenness

2504.339 --> 2511.25
that also feeds into that intention at

2508.28 --> 2516.13
that moment and because I'm complete I

2511.25 --> 2516.13
can do this much better I can manifest

2516.25 --> 2524.75
myself and my interaction with other

2520.849 --> 2527.0
people better I know this I hope no I I

2524.75 --> 2530.51
don't think I'm overestimating my said

2527.0 --> 2539.119
look guys you don't understand what it

2530.51 --> 2542.1800000000003
feels like this different it of course

2539.119 --> 2544.67
just talking about it is not really on

2542.18 --> 2547.3999999999996
the long run gonna convince anyone so

2544.67 --> 2549.799
yeah I'm gonna have to actually put some

2547.4 --> 2555.589
put down some empirical evidence and

2549.799 --> 2558.47
show you what I got now we gotta figure

2555.589 --> 2561.349
out my way through as I said it might

2558.47 --> 2567.72
take some time to really reconfigure

2561.349 --> 2571.11
myself properly yeah YouTube really

2567.72 --> 2571.1099999999997
[Music]

2573.099 --> 2580.119
Fyodor Dostoevsky yeah you got a problem

2575.809 --> 2580.119
that's what you want it's not gonna work

2605.299 --> 2610.91
what who says you're supposed to hold

2608.549 --> 2614.299
the entire universe in your mind now

2610.91 --> 2619.499
that's not it at all Fyodor Dostoevsky

2614.299 --> 2622.739
the entire universe is in God's mind you

2619.499 --> 2625.549
don't have to literally have the entire

2622.739 --> 2627.599
information content in your mind to

2625.549 --> 2630.63
suggest such a thing is kind of

2627.599 --> 2634.319
ludicrous an arrogant know what you do

2630.63 --> 2639.079
is you just connect with the frequency

2634.319 --> 2645.66
and then God relays to you what you need

2639.079 --> 2650.69
yeah so your entire perceptual angle of

2645.66 --> 2650.69
approach to the situation is mistaken

2662.09 --> 2671.54
a Missouri bear yeah I've been like for

2668.27 --> 2676.39
45 minutes I've got some screaming

2671.54 --> 2676.39
problems or some internet issues

2694.87 --> 2701.48
it's it's weird how that works I even

2699.74 --> 2706.12
remember that I have my own issues with

2701.48 --> 2709.19
it is that if you want to separate from

2706.12 --> 2713.23
the realization of the creator and the

2709.19 --> 2717.4700000000003
knower of all things spiritually then

2713.23 --> 2723.04
your consciousness as it is getting cut

2717.47 --> 2728.2999999999997
off will start to try to replace it and

2723.04 --> 2732.17
the only way it can do it is within the

2728.3 --> 2735.6200000000003
mind so it's almost like oh god there is

2732.17 --> 2738.14
no God I'm gonna have to replace it then

2735.62 --> 2742.49
with understanding and rationality and

2738.14 --> 2744.7999999999997
and and try to replace a framework for

2742.49 --> 2749.1499999999996
the entire reality well guess what came

2744.8 --> 2750.65
out of that what eventually came out of

2749.15 --> 2754.25
that that process yeah

2750.65 --> 2757.84
the entire reversed world logic the ball

2754.25 --> 2757.84
earth evolution

2762.99 --> 2771.9799999999996
is an attempt to replace what was lost

2766.71 --> 2771.98
when the connection was severed

2772.49 --> 2780.75
spiritually because if you are connected

2778.619 --> 2783.9300000000003
it doesn't necessarily directly

2780.75 --> 2787.5
correlate to chakras it's just the

2783.93 --> 2790.49
conscious realization but yeah when you

2787.5 --> 2794.7
have that connection and you allow it

2790.49 --> 2804.5099999999998
then you immediately notice how futile

2794.7 --> 2806.6699999999996
it is what atheists do but it's it's

2804.51 --> 2809.25
something that it's very yeah you can't

2806.67 --> 2811.859
really describe it properly to somebody

2809.25 --> 2814.559
that's still there just like you can't

2811.859 --> 2816.54
really relay and why the earth might not

2814.559 --> 2820.28
be a ball despite all the evidences

2816.54 --> 2823.8
because they're not can't reach them

2820.28 --> 2826.619
they deflect it because it breaks

2823.8 --> 2830.069
directly with their original preset

2826.619 --> 2832.319
where they are severed from God so that

2830.069 --> 2835.2599999999998
when you then touch upon the original

2832.319 --> 2837.359
truth that immediately touches that very

2835.26 --> 2839.25
sore spot that they don't know how to

2837.359 --> 2845.0099999999998
overcome so they run from it they

2839.25 --> 2847.19
amnezia springs forth that's the

2845.01 --> 2847.19
mechanism

2855.569 --> 2877.94
oh damn I urge I don't know what is that

2864.44 --> 2877.94
getting a headache again hmm

2882.11 --> 2891.9500000000003
a being I guess yeah I didn't know that

2888.77 --> 2893.66
word damn I urge yeah I guess being

2891.95 --> 2897.62
responsible for the creation of the

2893.66 --> 2899.54
universe universe of creation being

2897.62 --> 2903.88
responsible for creation I think that's

2899.54 --> 2903.88
a better way to describe it

2912.18 --> 2919.95
but yeah from my own perspective I say

2915.9 --> 2922.559
that through creation itself

2919.95 --> 2924.839
we are creation we are a part of

2922.559 --> 2928.26
creation it's all springing forth from

2924.839 --> 2930.299
the creation and through those building

2928.26 --> 2933.1800000000003
blocks through the very structure that

2930.299 --> 2938.49
was created and designed originally by

2933.18 --> 2946.19
the original creator we have access to

2938.49 --> 2952.89
him to our Creator because of the design

2946.19 --> 2955.349
it's like the trademark or the the

2952.89 --> 2958.92
designers stamp with so many ways you

2955.349 --> 2962.2200000000003
could approach this but it it works out

2958.92 --> 2965.329
so it's all about just letting the truth

2962.22 --> 2970.5589999999997
sink in everything is about that

2965.329 --> 2973.799
everything and the struggle against it

2970.559 --> 2974.849
also on the other side that is what

2973.799 --> 2985.049
everything is about

2974.849 --> 2987.6600000000003
what humans do ascending further into

2985.049 --> 2993.569
the truth further into the light further

2987.66 --> 2998.43
onto the path and express the design

2993.569 --> 3003.5
that was given to you with what you have

2998.43 --> 3006.14
to do in your life like really have to

3003.5 --> 3009.47
do not be made to think what you have to

3006.14 --> 3012.2889999999998
do but what you really came to do so

3009.47 --> 3014.89
expressed in the design the more you

3012.289 --> 3019.579
ignore lies and deviations the more you

3014.89 --> 3024.6189999999997
deny Lucifer and Ahriman the more clear

3019.579 --> 3027.4100000000003
it becomes what the path is what the

3024.619 --> 3033.98
root of the path is for you as an

3027.41 --> 3037.22
individual and you are with God when you

3033.98 --> 3039.589
do this and with all the blessings that

3037.22 --> 3043.6899999999996
come with it until you stumble because

3039.589 --> 3043.69
it's no guarantee of course every wood

3044.19 --> 3047.63
have to be vigilant

3054.79 --> 3062.72
like our entire lives revolve around

3059.15 --> 3064.7000000000003
making mistakes and getting over those

3062.72 --> 3067.4599999999996
mistakes and correcting for the mistakes

3064.7 --> 3070.7
everything so to assume that you'd reach

3067.46 --> 3071.45
some point where no more mistakes will

3070.7 --> 3079.37
be made

3071.45 --> 3083.96
seems kind of foolish or yeah not not

3079.37 --> 3086.48
very insightful to me so it is also

3083.96 --> 3089.42
about the effort on staying on the path

3086.48 --> 3092.8
not deviating it's it's a constant

3089.42 --> 3092.8
effort but that's what it's about

3092.98 --> 3099.8
no star I see seeking star water not

3097.16 --> 3102.37
Lucifer a light bringer no not not that

3099.8 --> 3107.71
content I'm talking about the spiritual

3102.37 --> 3111.71
context and in a way it is it's just

3107.71 --> 3115.31
been put down in a more specific narrow

3111.71 --> 3121.58
way Lucifer and Ahriman the seducer the

3115.31 --> 3133.1
arrogant one and Ahriman the destroyer

3121.58 --> 3136.22
the depressor the void the end and fear

3133.1 --> 3138.02
and Lucifer is just the other side of it

3136.22 --> 3140.0299999999997
so it's like Oh everything's always

3138.02 --> 3141.65
Lucifer is always telling you that

3140.03 --> 3141.9500000000003
everything is better when you do what he

3141.65 --> 3145.25
says

3141.95 --> 3151.7599999999998
and it may preliminary levy does use a

3145.25 --> 3153.92
lot of dazzling things to convince you

3151.76 --> 3156.0800000000004
to lure you with him to seduce you

3153.92 --> 3158.7200000000003
that's why he's a seducer and it's a

3156.08 --> 3162.29
spirit it's a spirit that is part of

3158.72 --> 3164.12
everyone that can be part of everyone

3162.29 --> 3166.22
that everybody as an individual as an

3164.12 --> 3168.47
individual consciousness is confronted

3166.22 --> 3171.8599999999997
with just like everyone it's part of us

3168.47 --> 3174.68
all it's up to you whether you start to

3171.86 --> 3178.1200000000003
listen to them and be fooled by them and

3174.68 --> 3181.52
dragged down by them or if you're gonna

3178.12 --> 3183.44
figure it out and start to walk the path

3181.52 --> 3186.74
of Christ

3183.44 --> 3194.599
the sensible path based on logos and not

3186.74 --> 3198.5589999999997
be fooled you can call that Satan if you

3194.599 --> 3203.119
like I like to distinguish I I really

3198.559 --> 3207.1090000000004
like the the Rudolf Steiner approach and

3203.119 --> 3211.9300000000003
I think it is legitimate and anyone that

3207.109 --> 3215.5389999999998
says that it isn't is just incompetent

3211.93 --> 3226.3089999999997
they don't get it because it is

3215.539 --> 3228.71
Christian it's all about the light it's

3226.309 --> 3232.9700000000003
all about the truth it's all about the

3228.71 --> 3235.2200000000003
struggle that is what it is it's not it

3232.97 --> 3237.95
has to be written down instead no it's

3235.22 --> 3240.47
about the entity it's about the

3237.95 --> 3242.6299999999997
direction it's about the design purpose

3240.47 --> 3245.47
that's what it's all about that's what

3242.63 --> 3245.4700000000003
it's always been about

3275.47 --> 3279.8999999999996
yo boy neat what are you doing here

3290.3 --> 3293.53
are you talking about

3304.07 --> 3311.71
being okay well you're making like

3308.8 --> 3316.2200000000003
statements that seem kind of

3311.71 --> 3319.43
contradictory are you just being a

3316.22 --> 3325.97
stick-in-the-mud got assert your your

3319.43 --> 3328.81
unbelief because I don't get the feeling

3325.97 --> 3328.81
you're actually listening

3339.09 --> 3342.659
[Music]

3348.82 --> 3350.88
you

3355.25 --> 3358.75
you guys talking about

3374.88 --> 3379.4900000000002
yeah well duality only gets to you if

3378.33 --> 3385.86
you let it

3379.49 --> 3388.3199999999997
pointage you gotta put it in a wider

3385.86 --> 3392.85
context yeah sure there's always

3388.32 --> 3398.8500000000004
darkness that still stands but to assume

3392.85 --> 3403.14
that it is in a that it is of equal that

3398.85 --> 3405.8399999999997
it is equal to the light that's that's

3403.14 --> 3407.97
where you're wrong that's a sign of a

3405.84 --> 3410.7200000000003
lack of distinguishment lack of

3407.97 --> 3410.72
understanding

3415.5 --> 3422.659
[Music]

3424.91 --> 3435.479
have any information I can't look into

3429.68 --> 3442.3799999999997
I'm starting this new ad right Katrina

3435.479 --> 3445.109
Scott I just flat earth or do you mean

3442.38 --> 3447.299
concerning the rudolf steiner lore with

3445.109 --> 3457.859
the spiritual stuff because i talk about

3447.299 --> 3461.759
that too well in general concerning Flat

3457.859 --> 3465.569
Earth I don't know it's there's a whole

3461.759 --> 3469.079
range of people that discuss it I'd say

3465.569 --> 3473.999
okay Flat Earth debates is a pretty good

3469.079 --> 3476.6600000000003
baseline spot but it's not perfect and

3473.999 --> 3479.2189999999996
there is just a lot of negativity

3476.66 --> 3485.069
psychological warfare and all that so it

3479.219 --> 3487.2000000000003
might not be of your tastes but if

3485.069 --> 3489.319
you're just one if you just want to

3487.2 --> 3491.6989999999996
learn about the nature of the realm

3489.319 --> 3495.299
there's all kinds of people I talk about

3491.699 --> 3498.119
it too but for beginners all right well

3495.299 --> 3504.509
if you're really really a beginner then

3498.119 --> 3508.38
I I guess I'd go with Mark sergeant it's

3504.509 --> 3511.41
not perfect but it's okay and it is very

3508.38 --> 3514.049
clear it was mark sergeant really made

3511.41 --> 3516.839
his thing for for newbies for the

3514.049 --> 3525.119
freshmen and it is it was effective to

3516.839 --> 3529.2889999999998
me so I checked those out and I know

3525.119 --> 3532.4
there's other people to Karen B talks

3529.289 --> 3532.4
about it and

3543.84 --> 3551.98
well George Sanford yeah and to base 200

3548.47 --> 3555.85
proofs could be good but yeah you do get

3551.98 --> 3557.95
risk of Savannah poisoning if you if

3555.85 --> 3565.45
turn out to like that a little bit too

3557.95 --> 3569.71
much so but it's decent I had David

3565.45 --> 3574.1499999999996
Weiss very good he's a fervent disc

3569.71 --> 3576.76
earth model proponent unfortunately but

3574.15 --> 3582.03
it's still very good to learn about and

3576.76 --> 3582.03
he is a chap it's done some great work

3587.34 --> 3593.7400000000002
flat water can be kind of good but he

3590.95 --> 3597.2799999999997
focuses mostly on he is a disc earth or

3593.74 --> 3603.12
two seems but if he mostly focuses on

3597.28 --> 3603.1200000000003
Bible on Bible things

3609.68 --> 3613.8799999999997
right Karen B yeah that's why I said

3611.99 --> 3617.359
with Eric Dubay you your kind of risk

3613.88 --> 3629.75
self Anya poisoning if you like it too

3617.359 --> 3633.589
much doesn't I didn't know that I

3629.75 --> 3636.039
haven't paid attention to him in a long

3633.589 --> 3636.0389999999998
time

3644.46 --> 3648.67
especially after he started to like

3646.63 --> 3650.369
public he call me Jew boy and

3648.67 --> 3653.369
everything's like what

3650.369 --> 3653.369
really

3668.92 --> 3674.66
well let's just say it like that

3671.12 --> 3676.3399999999997
this if you really like Nick Fuentes if

3674.66 --> 3682.2799999999997
you really love that guy think it's

3676.34 --> 3685.28
super awesome and/or so hardcore older

3682.28 --> 3687.6800000000003
yeah all that then Eric Dubay is

3685.28 --> 3689.7200000000003
probably ideal for you to transit into

3687.68 --> 3691.8999999999996
Flat Earth it'll be straight down your

3689.72 --> 3691.8999999999996
lane

3708.73 --> 3714.88

right oh yeah my perspective I haven't

3793.54 --> 3797.59
seen a lot of activity from him but yeah

3795.28 --> 3803.76
my perspective wasn't he's like one of

3797.59 --> 3807.6400000000003
the first wave guys he really put down

3803.76 --> 3809.9500000000003
some good things concerning visuals and

3807.64 --> 3814.17
optics and how that's like with great
