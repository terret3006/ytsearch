changes

75.68 --> 82.47900000000001
so yeah the weather today is different

80.479 --> 85.28
it was quite some crazy weather

82.479 --> 85.28
yesterday like

85.759 --> 92.32
there was this storm going on and it got

89.2 --> 92.72
really heavy like really freaking heavy

92.32 --> 94.72
and i

92.72 --> 98.64
actually managed to do my newspaper

94.72 --> 100.56
rounds in that freaking storm

98.64 --> 102.159
without my newspaper blowing in all

100.56 --> 104.88
directions even though that was

102.159 --> 107.28
basically constantly happening and

104.88 --> 109.759
it was quite a challenge to prevent that

107.28 --> 111.92
from happening but i managed it

109.759 --> 115.84
and well there was no rain so it wasn't

111.92 --> 118.24000000000001
really that big of a problem

115.84 --> 121.28
but it was just a massive storm and it

118.24 --> 124.399
only kind of died down

121.28 --> 125.43900000000001
somewhere in the night finally because

124.399 --> 129.84
it was getting

125.439 --> 129.84
really heavy stormy

130.22 --> 136.0
[Music]

131.84 --> 136.0
but it's a little better now uh yeah

136.72 --> 140.239
still mostly clouded a little sun here

139.599 --> 142.48
and there

140.239 --> 143.52
still some wind but not as crazy as

142.48 --> 146.64
yesterday

143.52 --> 150.64000000000001
it's like there were literally just leaf

146.64 --> 154.72
tornadoes everywhere everywhere

150.64 --> 154.72
yesterday it was quite a spectacle

154.959 --> 162.72
yeah right so let's see who is in chat

159.44 --> 164.239
i got green tea with me today agm was

162.72 --> 166.64
first good servant

164.239 --> 171.12
over mukul good to see you so far on

166.64 --> 173.44
this thursday

171.12 --> 173.44
ah

175.28 --> 180.879
i hope you guys doing all right i was

178.4 --> 182.84
up pretty early this morning before 12.

180.879 --> 186.64
whoo

182.84 --> 189.68
uh and had a pretty

186.64 --> 189.67999999999998
good night rest

190.56 --> 196.959
despite yeah not going to bed too early

193.68 --> 200.08
it all worked out great i feel

196.959 --> 200.08
relatively rested

201.04 --> 205.35999999999999
i started noticing a strange pattern

202.959 --> 207.599
that i haven't really had any dinner for

205.36 --> 211.04000000000002
like two days in a row

207.599 --> 211.04
but maybe that's because of

211.519 --> 215.84
my jaw situation because i've noticed

213.599 --> 215.84
that

216.239 --> 221.20000000000002
well whatever was basically bothering me

218.959 --> 223.44
in the last period it has now kind of

221.2 --> 223.44
like

223.92 --> 227.35999999999999
yeah ballooned up a little but not

226.08 --> 228.959
terribly thank god

227.36 --> 232.239
because i haven't because i've been

228.959 --> 235.2
really careful with my jaw

232.239 --> 237.04
but yeah that means that well that means

235.2 --> 237.439
pretty much that the inflammation is

237.04 --> 239.599
over

237.439 --> 241.35999999999999
that's now the aftermath which is very

239.599 --> 243.51899999999998
annoying

241.36 --> 244.48000000000002
it's like a sensitive yeah pressure

243.519 --> 246.48000000000002
cushion in there

244.48 --> 247.67999999999998
but i know it's a good sign because that

246.48 --> 249.599
means

247.68 --> 251.28
it's in the clean up stages that means

249.599 --> 251.599
it's going to be gone i'm very glad of

251.28 --> 254.64000000000001
that

251.599 --> 257.359
because it sucks having like

254.64 --> 259.44
your jaw annoy you and distract you a

257.359 --> 262.15999999999997
lot of the time

259.44 --> 263.12
though it doesn't really bother me all

262.16 --> 267.91900000000004
throughout the day

263.12 --> 269.12
thankfully it has been for a few nights

267.919 --> 270.88
when i go to sleep

269.12 --> 272.32
i don't know probably because when you

270.88 --> 276.24
lie down the blood

272.32 --> 279.84
also pushes more on your head

276.24 --> 282.88
and then also on that so but yeah i'm

279.84 --> 285.52
still here

282.88 --> 285.52
and i'm doing

295.759 --> 300.16
all good yeah uh neil constantino good

298.96 --> 303.59999999999997
to see you

300.16 --> 303.6
tiny wombo roger

304.72 --> 309.84000000000003
yeah yeah i watched back yesterday's

307.919 --> 311.75899999999996
show

309.84 --> 313.75899999999996
and it was actually it turned out to be

311.759 --> 314.24
pretty good even though it was just a

313.759 --> 316.639
bit of

314.24 --> 317.68
general talk computers and stuff but it

316.639 --> 319.6
was a pretty good show

317.68 --> 322.479
in retrospect's weird because i didn't

319.6 --> 326.24
think it was going to be that good

322.479 --> 329.52
oh well right and this morning nathan

326.24 --> 332.72
very early and that's why i managed to

329.52 --> 336.479
catch it he did another premiere

332.72 --> 336.47900000000004
he said it was too empty

337.52 --> 340.88
but that was a good show too

342.56 --> 347.36
there's a lot of good flat earth debate

344.4 --> 347.35999999999996
shows a lot of them

348.56 --> 353.12
like hundreds now hundreds of really

351.919 --> 357.19899999999996
really good shows

353.12 --> 357.199
that kind of stand to test the time even

357.36 --> 361.759
because if if we were in a phase where

360.24 --> 364.40000000000003
certain mistakes

361.759 --> 366.56
were basically there then at least we

364.4 --> 368.88
would address

366.56 --> 372.16
that we were not fully in the know yet

368.88 --> 375.199
we were like it's very clear the process

372.16 --> 377.03900000000004
of our learning curve is very wide open

375.199 --> 380.08000000000004
throughout the debates and throughout

377.039 --> 380.88
letter of the early word show two and

380.08 --> 383.12
that makes

380.88 --> 385.12
pretty much any episode that's just good

383.12 --> 387.6
and full of energy good

385.12 --> 390.16
even though it might have been older

387.6 --> 395.84000000000003
argument based

390.16 --> 395.84000000000003
i think at least anyway

401.52 --> 406.4
nice and sunny day today over there tiny

404.08 --> 406.4
wumbo

407.52 --> 412.31899999999996
where is that again where are you at

420.84 --> 423.84
hmm

426.639 --> 432.479
east coast of england oh okay

430.24 --> 432.479
huh

434.96 --> 439.599
all right i guess you got a a nice spot

437.68 --> 441.599
then

439.599 --> 442.96
because there you look in all of this

441.599 --> 446.15999999999997
weather in the last month

442.96 --> 449.44
say there has been like pretty nice

446.16 --> 451.44
sunny clear skied spots in between

449.44 --> 452.56
all the cloudiness as well so you might

451.44 --> 456.479
have just caught

452.56 --> 456.479
one of those spots good for you

460.08 --> 466.639
right anyway i did make notes

464.0 --> 468.639
yesterday i even made note of my

466.639 --> 469.52
newspapers being very windy i guess i'm

468.639 --> 474.319
just going to make

469.52 --> 478.0
full notes of whatever now right

474.319 --> 481.599
uh yeah rodrigo ferrari

478.0 --> 484.96
nunez had a a video

481.599 --> 487.68
he was doing a a movie report about

484.96 --> 489.44
minority report very long and he like

487.68 --> 491.84000000000003
that video got

489.44 --> 494.24
what midstream got like removed from

491.84 --> 496.63899999999995
youtube

494.24 --> 497.44
but he was also streaming over at d live

496.639 --> 500.639
and it was

497.44 --> 502.479
it was pretty good but

500.639 --> 503.68
yeah everything that he was talking

502.479 --> 506.56
about i

503.68 --> 507.36
i already kind of knew that like i'm a

506.56 --> 510.4
great fan

507.36 --> 512.399
of the movie because it was so early and

510.4 --> 515.1999999999999
it had so many things in it

512.399 --> 515.68
he did manage to point out a couple of

515.2 --> 518.839
like

515.68 --> 520.3199999999999
dramatic manipulations that i might have

518.839 --> 522.0
overlooked

520.32 --> 524.08
in a way because it because you're

522.0 --> 525.6
distracted by all the technologies and

524.08 --> 528.24
everything you're confronted with

525.6 --> 530.48
so that was kind of funny to he did

528.24 --> 531.2
point at a couple of typical directors

530.48 --> 534.32
decisions

531.2 --> 537.12
and even little plot holes technical

534.32 --> 540.6400000000001
mechanical things that make no sense or

537.12 --> 540.64
at least to him made no sense but

541.12 --> 544.8
yeah there's a very long stream i didn't

542.959 --> 549.8389999999999
watch all of it beginning

544.8 --> 549.8389999999999
the and the end of it

551.04 --> 556.399
that was over rodrigo ferrari nunes

554.48 --> 557.9200000000001
do you tend to appreciate many of his

556.399 --> 561.279
dreams

557.92 --> 562.24
uh not often by the way sometimes it

561.279 --> 564.0
just

562.24 --> 565.36
hits a tone that i don't really like i

564.0 --> 566.959
don't know but

565.36 --> 570.88
yeah most of them have been very

566.959 --> 573.4399999999999
interesting to be a part of in the chat

570.88 --> 574.959
right oh yeah other than that i kind of

573.44 --> 576.8000000000001
i played more games i

574.959 --> 579.279
finished basically playing through

576.8 --> 582.0799999999999
baldur's gate

579.279 --> 583.6
siege of the dragon spear and my god

582.08 --> 587.12
i've had some pretty

583.6 --> 592.48
bizarre realizations about that game

587.12 --> 592.48
but it's so surreal i don't know i

592.64 --> 596.8
i don't feel like this is a story it

594.959 --> 599.92
should just

596.8 --> 603.1999999999999
relate openly like that

599.92 --> 606.7199999999999
but it just had to do with yeah certain

603.2 --> 611.44
really like weird spiritual

606.72 --> 611.44
trips sort of that i had during

612.8 --> 616.8389999999999
during my late school years in the

615.76 --> 620.399
company

616.839 --> 624.32
with a certain figure

620.399 --> 624.32
that just makes me feel like

624.8 --> 629.5999999999999
this game just sounds so familiar in

628.0 --> 632.88
ways

629.6 --> 636.5600000000001
sometimes i wonder if i sort of

632.88 --> 640.0
via fia had an influence on

636.56 --> 642.56
on like the feel of the story in ways

640.0 --> 643.12
especially the main villain of it it's

642.56 --> 645.5999999999999
it's a

643.12 --> 646.399
fascinating conceptual character in

645.6 --> 650.64
there

646.399 --> 653.839
like it makes the story really thick

650.64 --> 656.56
in that in that game separately so

653.839 --> 658.1600000000001
yeah i'm just really impressed how well

656.56 --> 660.64
that game

658.16 --> 661.1999999999999
has been designed and it really fits in

660.64 --> 663.279
the

661.2 --> 664.88
the first and the second baldur's gate

663.279 --> 668.56
very well

664.88 --> 670.079
almost wish they had slightly adapted

668.56 --> 671.8389999999999
well there's the beginning of baldur's

670.079 --> 675.1999999999999
gate 2 to kind of work

671.839 --> 678.24
into that a little more

675.2 --> 682.1600000000001
it barely needs changes for that

678.24 --> 684.24
but it would be awesome to adapt certain

682.16 --> 686.8
types of conversations just a couple of

684.24 --> 689.279
lines in the massive scheme of the game

686.8 --> 690.8
that so many lines so just a couple

689.279 --> 692.88
slight adaptations of

690.8 --> 695.519
polish gate 2 and it would like really

692.88 --> 699.279
bridge into it also i noticed

695.519 --> 701.279
gamer anger gamer anger i could not

699.279 --> 702.32
import my character files from the

701.279 --> 706.48
dragon

702.32 --> 709.12
spear siege game

706.48 --> 711.04
very disappointed i could not import the

709.12 --> 712.82
character from that game for some reason

711.04 --> 714.24
i don't know why

712.82 --> 717.519
[Music]

714.24 --> 720.0
yeah who cares i know but

717.519 --> 720.0
silly me

724.079 --> 730.079
but anyway yeah finished that game

727.36 --> 730.5600000000001
was impressed thinking feeling about it

730.079 --> 732.8
also

730.56 --> 733.68
just overall impressed about the sheer

732.8 --> 737.3599999999999
amount of

733.68 --> 737.3599999999999
spoken conversation in it

738.24 --> 742.88
it's a lot it's like in polish gate

740.639 --> 744.0
there was conversation and it was pretty

742.88 --> 746.079
cool

744.0 --> 747.68
and polish gate 2 had a lot of

746.079 --> 751.04
conversation

747.68 --> 753.5999999999999
but it was also a sure yeah overall

751.04 --> 753.5999999999999
compared

754.48 --> 758.5600000000001
maybe a little well maybe no not the

756.72 --> 760.399
first polish gate baldur's gate 2 the

758.56 --> 763.04
first part is definitely not a short

760.399 --> 765.36
game absolutely not

763.04 --> 766.399
but yeah then this one that came

765.36 --> 767.92
afterward that's the

766.399 --> 770.079
wildest gate one and a half you could

767.92 --> 773.12
say the in between

770.079 --> 775.76
it has so many conversation

773.12 --> 776.16
compared to the game that is overall not

775.76 --> 778.24
that

776.16 --> 779.279
extensive and pretty railroaded but it's

778.24 --> 782.72
good i like it

779.279 --> 783.279
it's really it fits so well in between

782.72 --> 786.9590000000001
anyway

783.279 --> 790.399
enough gushing about me and my designer

786.959 --> 793.1999999999999
love for games whatever i played it

790.399 --> 794.56
finished it now yeah that's kind of the

793.2 --> 798.0790000000001
end of that for a while

794.56 --> 798.56
although i did try out again to continue

798.079 --> 800.7199999999999
it

798.56 --> 803.4399999999999
with polish gate 2 and was disappointed

800.72 --> 803.44
that i couldn't

806.16 --> 813.279
not in the way that i wanted anyway

809.519 --> 814.079
but yeah never mind also owen benjamin

813.279 --> 817.04
was very

814.079 --> 818.16
late but since i stayed up kind of late

817.04 --> 821.279
i did catch him

818.16 --> 821.279
and that was pretty awesome

821.6 --> 826.72
i should have made more notes about it

823.68 --> 826.7199999999999
was about again

826.839 --> 831.12
just

829.279 --> 832.72
good letters he had some really

831.12 --> 835.38
interesting letters that are very

832.72 --> 837.839
inspiring and interesting

835.38 --> 840.32
[Music]

837.839 --> 841.6
and also he did a great skit i remember

840.32 --> 844.72
now he did a great

841.6 --> 848.5600000000001
he did like a song and then he would

844.72 --> 851.6
improvise lyrics based on jokes

848.56 --> 853.279
and he kind of kept that up for five

851.6 --> 853.839
minutes or something i didn't keep track

853.279 --> 856.8
but

853.839 --> 857.519
very long it was so funny it was so good

856.8 --> 861.199
it's

857.519 --> 863.44
like holy [ __ ] but he was yeah he said

861.199 --> 865.68
it was due to the coffee apparently he's

863.44 --> 866.9590000000001
drinks a lot of coffee i hope that works

865.68 --> 868.8389999999999
out

866.959 --> 870.0
too healthy on the long run but he knows

868.839 --> 875.6800000000001
that

870.0 --> 878.959
but yeah he was just very focused

875.68 --> 878.959
and it was very funny

879.12 --> 886.24
what he did there the improv and that's

884.32 --> 888.8000000000001
very difficult to do to literally

886.24 --> 889.519
improvise while playing music at the

888.8 --> 891.199
same time

889.519 --> 894.9590000000001
improvise with text while playing with

891.199 --> 897.8389999999999
music and make the text jokes

894.959 --> 898.079
not that easy and he also kind of made

897.839 --> 900.0400000000001
it

898.079 --> 902.2399999999999
rhyme as well and that's even more

900.04 --> 904.7199999999999
mind-boggling like whoa

902.24 --> 906.5600000000001
he made a lot of parts of it just rhyme

904.72 --> 907.6
with the jokes and it's just like holy

906.56 --> 910.4799999999999
[ __ ] dude

907.6 --> 911.6800000000001
that was really freaking amazing so i

910.48 --> 915.839
was very glad

911.68 --> 918.56
that i caught that before i went to bed

915.839 --> 919.9200000000001
right and yeah that's it that's as far

918.56 --> 926.8
as my notes go

919.92 --> 928.959
for yesterday right

926.8 --> 930.079
oh yeah amanda jung was there in

928.959 --> 932.6389999999999
rodriguez

930.079 --> 932.6389999999999
chat too

933.839 --> 946.24
hey julio pavin good to see you

940.56 --> 946.2399999999999
and a koala michael's not grass too

952.88 --> 957.8389999999999
yeah thanks hot tea and raw honey

958.639 --> 962.399
honey why not but i don't i don't put

961.759 --> 965.6
sweet stuff

962.399 --> 968.0
in my green tea i don't really like that

965.6 --> 968.8000000000001
i'm very glad that i don't do that

968.0 --> 972.32
anymore

968.8 --> 973.5999999999999
i'm so glad that i got off the universal

972.32 --> 976.1600000000001
habit to have like

973.6 --> 976.72
some kind of sugar in some drink some

976.16 --> 979.12
way

976.72 --> 980.48
constantly because i think a lot of

979.12 --> 983.12
people have that

980.48 --> 984.399
have that habit either they put it in

983.12 --> 988.079
their coffee or

984.399 --> 990.399
in their tea or they have like sugary

988.079 --> 992.8
fizz drinks or coca-cola or

990.399 --> 994.56
something always something with sugar

992.8 --> 996.56
and they don't even

994.56 --> 998.959
realize it that much it's just that nude

996.56 --> 1002.079
they wanted to taste nice

998.959 --> 1003.279
right well i i got it out i really got

1002.079 --> 1005.5999999999999
it out the only thing that i didn't

1003.279 --> 1007.759
manage to get it out of is coffee

1005.6 --> 1009.44
because coffee without sugar you know

1007.759 --> 1012.5600000000001
coffee without

1009.44 --> 1013.6
milk was already one thing that was good

1012.56 --> 1015.5189999999999
transition

1013.6 --> 1017.519
but without sugar now i don't put a lot

1015.519 --> 1020.32
of it in there but

1017.519 --> 1021.12
without it's just i don't really find it

1020.32 --> 1024.64
that great

1021.12 --> 1026.48
at all then i would i wouldn't drink it

1024.64 --> 1028.5590000000002
quickly enough and then it'll it would

1026.48 --> 1032.319
get cold

1028.559 --> 1034.48
so yeah no not doing that but i don't

1032.319 --> 1036.1599999999999
i just drink one cup of coffee so that's

1034.48 --> 1041.6
like

1036.16 --> 1041.6000000000001
one spoon of sugar a day

1049.44 --> 1057.1200000000001
and i don't eat like cookies anymore

1054.08 --> 1057.6789999999999
oh god i loved cookies so much but i

1057.12 --> 1060.559
don't

1057.679 --> 1060.5590000000002
because it's sugar

1067.1 --> 1070.119
[Music]

1078.84 --> 1081.84
so

1090.64 --> 1093.679
sugar is poison

1092.48 --> 1095.919
[Music]

1093.679 --> 1099.039
well refined sugar is poison you know

1095.919 --> 1101.3600000000001
there's natural sugar and stuff and it's

1099.039 --> 1104.24
that's not really that bad it's just

1101.36 --> 1109.52
when you get too much of it

1104.24 --> 1123.84
yeah then it kind of becomes a drug

1109.52 --> 1123.84
and it's a very addictive drug

1134.08 --> 1138.72
all right uh yeah uh there's a little

1137.679 --> 1141.3600000000001
detail that

1138.72 --> 1144.16
i picked up i discussed it with um good

1141.36 --> 1146.8799999999999
servant before has anybody noticed that

1144.16 --> 1148.559
i think there's no standard hover over a

1146.88 --> 1151.8400000000001
short place of videos if

1148.559 --> 1151.84
has anybody noticed that

1152.48 --> 1157.919
and yeah as soon as i noticed that i

1155.84 --> 1160.3999999999999
started hovering over every single

1157.919 --> 1161.2800000000002
one of my videos and i noticed a

1160.4 --> 1164.48
distinct

1161.28 --> 1166.0
pattern and i'm not very happy about

1164.48 --> 1169.2
and they wonder if anybody else has

1166.0 --> 1172.24
noticed so good servants if you

1169.2 --> 1175.1200000000001
would be so kind as to not spoil it

1172.24 --> 1177.52
i would like to ask the rest of the chat

1175.12 --> 1181.6789999999999
to basically go to my videos

1177.52 --> 1184.72
to my home yeah open a separate tab

1181.679 --> 1187.679
go to my channel arwin

1184.72 --> 1188.16
and check out like the list of videos

1187.679 --> 1190.88
and then

1188.16 --> 1193.8400000000001
with your mouse or with whatever hover

1190.88 --> 1193.8400000000001
over the videos

1194.08 --> 1200.0

1197.2 --> 1202.32

1202.32 --> 1208.1589999999999

1205.28 --> 1210.3999999999999
tell me tell me what you see

1208.159 --> 1212.48
this is a serious request to everybody

1210.4 --> 1221.8400000000001
in chat

1212.48 --> 1221.84
if you would be so kind

1227.12 --> 1232.8799999999999
ha yeah tom parker that's one video

1230.159 --> 1235.44
that's one of the videos now all the

1232.88 --> 1237.919
others

1235.44 --> 1239.76
i see the same thing on all videos and

1237.919 --> 1249.8400000000001
what would that be

1239.76 --> 1249.84
isha makeda can you describe it

1253.039 --> 1257.76
okay drinking tea i also picked up one

1256.88 --> 1260.7990000000002
of those

1257.76 --> 1261.12
but yeah i've noticed yeah that's right

1260.799 --> 1264.1589999999999
i

1261.12 --> 1265.28
killed hope finally you picking up the

1264.159 --> 1268.3200000000002
camera that's right

1265.28 --> 1270.32
every single most of them i

1268.32 --> 1271.36
yeah i found two exceptions one where

1270.32 --> 1274.1589999999999
i'm drinking tea

1271.36 --> 1274.6399999999999
one where you see the outside all the

1274.159 --> 1278.0800000000002
others

1274.64 --> 1278.88
have my hand over it like this all of

1278.08 --> 1281.4399999999998
them

1278.88 --> 1282.7990000000002
oh this doesn't seem like sabotage at

1281.44 --> 1285.679
all thanks ai

1282.799 --> 1287.2
thanks for arbitrary picking the moments

1285.679 --> 1290.3200000000002
when i do pick up the camera

1287.2 --> 1291.1200000000001
which is not exactly in the same spot so

1290.32 --> 1294.6399999999999
the camera

1291.12 --> 1295.4399999999998
picks it out whether i do it early or

1294.64 --> 1298.159
late

1295.44 --> 1299.8400000000001
in my video and picks out the moment

1298.159 --> 1300.72
that i put my hand in front of the

1299.84 --> 1304.0
camera

1300.72 --> 1307.3600000000001
thanks thanks a lot that's

1304.0 --> 1309.36
so helpful that's really a great

1307.36 --> 1310.3999999999999
representation quick look of what my

1309.36 --> 1312.3999999999999
show is my hand

1310.4 --> 1313.8400000000001
put in front of the camera thanks a lot

1312.4 --> 1315.8400000000001
ai i really

1313.84 --> 1317.52
really appreciate it yeah and that's

1315.84 --> 1319.039
sarcasm by the way i know you have

1317.52 --> 1322.08
trouble reading that

1319.039 --> 1322.799
i'm not thankful at all it sucks could

1322.08 --> 1326.0
you please

1322.799 --> 1327.039
stop doing that it's really ridiculous

1326.0 --> 1330.559
why don't you just

1327.039 --> 1332.4
show me talking facing the camera

1330.559 --> 1333.9189999999999
that's and you can take any moment

1332.4 --> 1334.64
because you don't hear any sound of it

1333.919 --> 1338.0800000000002
anyway

1334.64 --> 1341.919
so just do that why

1338.08 --> 1344.08
are you sabotaging me by showing

1341.919 --> 1346.159
just a couple of frames of my freaking

1344.08 --> 1346.72
hand over the camera which doesn't

1346.159 --> 1349.0390000000002
reveal

1346.72 --> 1349.84
anything about the show why are you

1349.039 --> 1352.96
doing that

1349.84 --> 1356.24
why are you sabotaging me youtube could

1352.96 --> 1356.24
you please stop doing that

1358.96 --> 1364.0
yeah and it's my show it's just my show

1362.24 --> 1365.6
i've checked out other shows that it

1364.0 --> 1369.12
doesn't happen

1365.6 --> 1371.1999999999998
it shows different things like either

1369.12 --> 1373.28
just normally their face

1371.2 --> 1374.24
nathan oakley's just a lot of their face

1373.28 --> 1377.44
usually and then

1374.24 --> 1377.84
a quick flick at this main screen which

1377.44 --> 1381.3600000000001
is a

1377.84 --> 1384.6399999999999
good general show of what it contains

1381.36 --> 1388.1589999999999
yeah that's that's actually useful

1384.64 --> 1390.64
and even hovered over simon dan video

1388.159 --> 1392.96
and you just saw a picture of a genetic

1390.64 --> 1393.6000000000001
strands which is apparently very cool or

1392.96 --> 1397.52
something

1393.6 --> 1398.7199999999998
right well why why is it specifically

1397.52 --> 1401.9189999999999
sabotaging me

1398.72 --> 1405.2
with this because it is there's

1401.919 --> 1406.88
no point in picking that moment in my

1405.2 --> 1409.28
video to show as a

1406.88 --> 1410.72
short representation of what my videos

1409.28 --> 1414.96
are

1410.72 --> 1417.679
it's obvious deliberate sabotage

1414.96 --> 1419.919
in a very odd covert way because

1417.679 --> 1422.159
nobody's been told that this function is

1419.919 --> 1422.159
there

1422.4 --> 1428.799
it's they just unfold it well why do

1425.039 --> 1431.84
they unfold it like this with my videos

1428.799 --> 1433.12
is it that they just are trying to do

1431.84 --> 1437.1999999999998
everything they can to

1433.12 --> 1439.4399999999998
somehow give a flare of discredited

1437.2 --> 1440.559
to everything that i do even though they

1439.44 --> 1443.279
do just let me

1440.559 --> 1446.1589999999999
ride this platform without even striking

1443.279 --> 1446.159
me or anything

1446.799 --> 1455.44
they're just doing that youtube

1450.4 --> 1455.44
are you are you being like a really

1455.76 --> 1462.799
nasty partner here like

1459.12 --> 1463.4399999999998
you love me you hate me but the only way

1462.799 --> 1465.44
you

1463.44 --> 1467.44
feel you can get rid of me is by trying

1465.44 --> 1469.2
to demoralize me to step away even

1467.44 --> 1470.88
though that seems absolutely hopeless

1469.2 --> 1473.279
and everything i do is going in the

1470.88 --> 1476.96
direct opposite of that

1473.279 --> 1476.96
every time you do something like this

1477.84 --> 1482.559
are you like because i feel like i'm

1480.159 --> 1483.279
just a normal guy in a feminist relation

1482.559 --> 1486.6399999999999
here

1483.279 --> 1488.64
and the feminist partner insists

1486.64 --> 1490.3200000000002
that i [ __ ] to them even though i'm

1488.64 --> 1493.8400000000001
obviously not doing that telling them

1490.32 --> 1497.039
i'm not doing that and basically

1493.84 --> 1499.4399999999998
yeah using my own

1497.039 --> 1500.08
code of conduct towards them which is

1499.44 --> 1502.559
much more

1500.08 --> 1504.08
logical and that they regrettingly

1502.559 --> 1506.559
accept sort of

1504.08 --> 1508.48
well it kind of feels like that like

1506.559 --> 1509.6
they're they're talking behind my back

1508.48 --> 1512.48
and trying to make

1509.6 --> 1514.08
their own freaking boyfriend because i

1512.48 --> 1516.48
am financial partner

1514.08 --> 1517.52
technically trying to make me look

1516.48 --> 1519.44
stupid

1517.52 --> 1521.279
but they're not gonna do it to my face

1519.44 --> 1523.279
no no

1521.279 --> 1524.48
to my face it's just no no everything's

1523.279 --> 1526.84
all right huh

1524.48 --> 1529.3600000000001
that's what this feels like it's very

1526.84 --> 1531.12
annoying

1529.36 --> 1533.36
i don't appreciate being treated like

1531.12 --> 1533.36
that

1540.64 --> 1544.48
it's not a crossbow rob h for [ __ ]

[ __ ] sake people

1559.16 --> 1562.309
[Music]

1578.0 --> 1582.799
it gives a snapshot at the same point

1580.72 --> 1584.559
each video which happened to be at the

1582.799 --> 1586.72
same point no

1584.559 --> 1587.76
it just happened to happen to happen too

1586.72 --> 1590.72
really

1587.76 --> 1591.84
i checked video separately i don't pick

1590.72 --> 1595.1200000000001
up the camera

1591.84 --> 1597.84
at the same time point in each video

1595.12 --> 1599.9189999999999
it's different yet in those different

1597.84 --> 1602.48
moments the video still

1599.919 --> 1603.679
is set to show that specific moment so

1602.48 --> 1613.84
it's not

1603.679 --> 1613.8400000000001
just happened to be no no no no

1626.48 --> 1630.96
i don't know if you're a troll or not

1628.32 --> 1632.799
but i just addressed that

1630.96 --> 1634.96
next person is good just gonna get a

1632.799 --> 1639.039
timeout it's not a freaking

1634.96 --> 1643.76
crossbow it's a bow a composite bow

1639.039 --> 1648.1589999999999
classic style non plastic

1643.76 --> 1655.84
bow not crossbow

1648.159 --> 1655.8400000000001

[Music]

1679.679 --> 1684.72
right anyway yeah well if you don't

1683.12 --> 1686.8799999999999
if you hover over and you see nothing

1684.72 --> 1688.72
yeah then right

1686.88 --> 1690.3990000000001
but yeah everybody else here has pretty

1688.72 --> 1693.279
much confirmed

1690.399 --> 1693.279
my suspicion

1694.08 --> 1699.52
and it does just change the video

1697.44 --> 1701.52
thumbnail to that specific moment in

1699.52 --> 1704.1589999999999
most of my videos and i do not

1701.52 --> 1707.84
appreciate it i am

1704.159 --> 1707.8400000000001
yeah taking note of this

1709.52 --> 1716.1589999999999
or maybe you could call it an official

1711.84 --> 1716.1589999999999
complaint hey youtube could you stop

1716.64 --> 1723.5200000000002
designating the ai to sabotage

1720.48 --> 1726.96
my videos with little details it's

1723.52 --> 1726.96
very annoying

1734.24 --> 1738.96
like seriously just kick me off already

1738.159 --> 1740.88
then

1738.96 --> 1743.1200000000001
if you don't want me just kick me off

1740.88 --> 1746.159
you you do that [ __ ] anyway

1743.12 --> 1749.6789999999999
you really need an excuse i don't know

1746.159 --> 1752.48
man just call me a nazi or whatever

1749.679 --> 1754.24
you do that [ __ ] to anyone so if you

1752.48 --> 1756.32

1754.24 --> 1759.52
stupid [ __ ]

1756.32 --> 1763.76

1759.52 --> 1763.76
back stabbing poking me

1764.84 --> 1769.6
right if you want to get rid of me just

1767.679 --> 1772.64
dump me already you can do it

1769.6 --> 1775.6789999999999
nobody would give a [ __ ] except well

1772.64 --> 1777.44
people here on youtube of course this

1775.679 --> 1781.76
stupid backstabbing

1777.44 --> 1784.88
[ __ ] is really getting agitated

1781.76 --> 1784.8799999999999
i'm really sick of it

1785.84 --> 1789.6
the only reason i still do it

1789.919 --> 1795.2
is because i'm still yeah

1793.039 --> 1796.96
it's sort of an income that i can report

1795.2 --> 1800.24
to the go to my government

1796.96 --> 1802.159
and yeah i presume they're they'll leave

1800.24 --> 1805.36
me alone

1802.159 --> 1809.0390000000002
that's it doesn't mean that i

1805.36 --> 1811.6
technically need it to get around

1809.039 --> 1813.44
so hey if you want to get rid of me just

1811.6 --> 1816.799
delete it

1813.44 --> 1819.6000000000001
just say oh you have violated

1816.799 --> 1821.039
it because somebody thought i was gonna

1819.6 --> 1824.1589999999999
do something violent

1821.039 --> 1824.8799999999999
done delete do it already you stupid

1824.159 --> 1826.64
[ __ ]

1824.88 --> 1828.7990000000002
if you want to get rid of me just

1826.64 --> 1833.3600000000001
freaking delete my channel already

1828.799 --> 1837.84

1833.36 --> 1837.84
it's really annoying

1840.86 --> 1843.99
[Music]

1846.399 --> 1852.4799999999998
can you not put up your own thumbnails

1848.64 --> 1852.48
anymore i don't know how to do that

1855.44 --> 1859.3600000000001
maybe i could but that would mean that i

1857.279 --> 1862.64
would have to do it with every freaking

1859.36 --> 1865.84
video that's super annoying

1862.64 --> 1868.0800000000002
that's that's gonna be hours of work

1865.84 --> 1868.9599999999998
it's just not worth it so just why did

1868.08 --> 1879.84
it i have to

1868.96 --> 1879.8400000000001
auto screw it up

1910.24 --> 1914.32
yeah if you're gonna partner with me

1912.32 --> 1918.1589999999999
just partner with me

1914.32 --> 1919.519
just treat me like a normal youtube

1918.159 --> 1935.8400000000001
partner and stop

1919.519 --> 1935.84
screwing around with my numbers

[Music]

1945.65 --> 1949.1100000000001
[Music]

1946.84 --> 1952.29
right

1949.11 --> 1952.29
[Music]

1959.36 --> 1966.0
yeah that i said that tiny wombo yes

1963.12 --> 1966.7199999999998
and of course yeah that's probably the

1966.0 --> 1968.799
reason

1966.72 --> 1972.559
i think they're probably striking up a

1968.799 --> 1972.559
lot more money than they're even telling

1972.64 --> 1979.519
a lot more

1976.559 --> 1982.08
i don't care though only thing that

1979.519 --> 1983.6
really matters to me is paypal donations

1982.08 --> 1986.399
that's what really doing it and

1983.6 --> 1987.6
yeah patreon too but paypal is even

1986.399 --> 1991.36
better

1987.6 --> 1994.0
for me at this current time

1991.36 --> 1997.1999999999998
despite yeah the dubious backgrounds of

1994.0 --> 1997.2
certain individuals

1997.919 --> 2004.0
which i don't exactly like if you know

1999.76 --> 2019.84
what i mean but yeah

2004.0 --> 2019.84
it's kept me afloat

2020.0 --> 2023.919
and i just the flat earth early bird

2022.399 --> 2026.32
screen

2023.919 --> 2027.44
right well that should be the default

2026.32 --> 2030.1589999999999
you know when

2027.44 --> 2032.0800000000002
technically when you don't hover over it

2030.159 --> 2032.48
you do see the flat earth early bird

2032.08 --> 2034.799
thing

2032.48 --> 2036.88
you do see that so yeah of course that's

2034.799 --> 2038.96
good but when you hover over it and you

2036.88 --> 2042.72
have the function that you have a

2038.96 --> 2043.679
small video looking a short scroll

2042.72 --> 2045.519
thingy

2043.679 --> 2048.7200000000003
kind of just like on netflix except with

2045.519 --> 2051.919
netflix they also add sound to that

2048.72 --> 2052.9599999999996
well because of that yeah when you hover

2051.919 --> 2056.0789999999997
over it they

2052.96 --> 2058.96
they selected my freaking hand almost

2056.079 --> 2058.96
every single time

2059.119 --> 2061.839
for no good reason

2067.04 --> 2072.0
scent five super jet i'll send people

2070.879 --> 2075.839
next time awesome

2072.0 --> 2075.839
thank you tiny wumbo i appreciate that

2082.72 --> 2089.839

2128.32 --> 2131.44
yeah that's definitely gonna help out

2130.0 --> 2133.52
thank you for the super chat and thank

2131.44 --> 2136.0
you for the paypal donation julio pabin

2133.52 --> 2136.0
my man

2136.56 --> 2145.839
keeps me going bro thank you so much

2156.839 --> 2159.839
that

2161.28 --> 2172.6400000000003
that's you might have a point there

2164.88 --> 2176.079
that it's doing that but

2172.64 --> 2176.0789999999997
but that's just stupid

2179.119 --> 2184.079
don't i actually move around a lot as

2182.96 --> 2187.2
well

2184.079 --> 2189.76
hello see me arwen is very

2187.2 --> 2191.9199999999996
movie i always talk and move and move

2189.76 --> 2195.119
around and stretch and

2191.92 --> 2197.2000000000003
hello movement i have a lot of movement

2195.119 --> 2198.7200000000003
why would you use the freaking hand in

2197.2 --> 2201.839
front of the camera

2198.72 --> 2203.68
not even going to it or

2201.839 --> 2205.599
moving afterward because hey if it just

2203.68 --> 2207.839
looks outside that's why not

2205.599 --> 2209.2000000000003
why not i i would not mind that at least

2207.839 --> 2211.04
you could get a quick shot of the

2209.2 --> 2214.48
weather every single time you hover over

2211.04 --> 2216.96
see that would be actually kinda useful

2214.48 --> 2217.68
but no it has to be my freaking hand

2216.96 --> 2222.16
over it

2217.68 --> 2222.16
thanks thanks a lot

2226.32 --> 2230.7200000000003
but you make a point it might be because

2228.079 --> 2234.1600000000003
of just a sort of a motion detector

2230.72 --> 2237.04
detection trigger but it's stupid

2234.16 --> 2240.16
not all videos are like that very little

2237.04 --> 2243.359
videos are like that actually

2240.16 --> 2245.68
out there most videos are aren't just

2243.359 --> 2249.04
somebody in the frame beginning to end

2245.68 --> 2251.359
maybe an intro animation or something

2249.04 --> 2253.599
but hey even my early bird intro

2251.359 --> 2254.839
animation has plenty of things moving

2253.599 --> 2257.6800000000003
around

2254.839 --> 2261.7599999999998
remember in the last shot

2257.68 --> 2265.2
well why doesn't it use that then

2261.76 --> 2266.7200000000003
that comes first see so i don't know

2265.2 --> 2268.24
there might be something to what you

2266.72 --> 2271.839
said

2268.24 --> 2271.839
i would kill the hope but

2273.68 --> 2285.839
it yeah it's not foolproof though

2297.2 --> 2304.48
okay tiny bumble well hey in a way

2300.48 --> 2306.32
it's good it's a test i did that

2304.48 --> 2307.76
to see if that would happen and who

2306.32 --> 2311.599
knows maybe

2307.76 --> 2314.32
maybe after this over it will show that

2311.599 --> 2317.119
could be i don't know man i don't know

2314.32 --> 2317.119
we'll find out

2320.8 --> 2329.52
uh does he look like family of that guy

2326.32 --> 2341.839
oj no

2329.52 --> 2341.839
i don't think so

2351.2 --> 2356.64
they would use the webcam in your

2353.68 --> 2356.64
opinion what do you mean

2366.16 --> 2372.7999999999997
oh it is it that's not over here

2369.68 --> 2375.68
look camera moving camera moving not my

2372.8 --> 2375.6800000000003
hand in front of it

2376.16 --> 2382.8799999999997
see it's still just the same

2379.76 --> 2385.3590000000004
like thin clouds still

2382.88 --> 2386.87
holes in between no real rain it's it's

2385.359 --> 2389.929
not even that moist

2386.87 --> 2389.929
[Music]

2391.359 --> 2397.839
oh you're at the coast right

2399.76 --> 2403.5200000000004
i know contrast change on the webcam

2402.56 --> 2406.0789999999997
yeah that happens

2403.52 --> 2408.8
when it has it has autofocus auto zoom

2406.079 --> 2408.8
and all that so

2417.04 --> 2421.04
anyway yeah it's the internet screwing

2420.4 --> 2422.88
around

2421.04 --> 2424.96
youtube screwing around with me is

2422.88 --> 2426.88
actually not that interesting a subject

2424.96 --> 2429.599
i just wanted to mention it

2426.88 --> 2432.079
took notice of that because i do i took

2429.599 --> 2436.88
take notice of details

2432.079 --> 2439.8390000000004
and i report on them as criticism

2436.88 --> 2439.839
huh

2447.119 --> 2456.7200000000003
wait what

2453.68 --> 2458.96
my hand is the closest shot

2456.72 --> 2458.9599999999996
hmm

2461.839 --> 2466.88
interesting that might be a factor as

2465.68 --> 2471.04
well good servant

2466.88 --> 2472.96
good point well we'll see

2471.04 --> 2475.52
we'll see if it's about the motion or

2472.96 --> 2478.8
the apparent proximity to the camera

2475.52 --> 2482.24
whatever triggers it we'll figure it out

2478.8 --> 2482.2400000000002
at least we tested it right

2493.44 --> 2497.359
youtube loves money but hates the truth

2500.48 --> 2504.16
which is kind of counterproductive

2502.24 --> 2506.7999999999997
though because hey

2504.16 --> 2507.5989999999997
at first when nothing interesting is

2506.8 --> 2510.8
going on yeah

2507.599 --> 2512.6400000000003
lies make a lot of money can you get

2510.8 --> 2514.079
things going when eventually lies get

2512.64 --> 2515.5989999999997
figured out

2514.079 --> 2517.76
and what youtube apparently doesn't

2515.599 --> 2520.0
understand is that there's

2517.76 --> 2521.119
when enough lies build up enough

2520.0 --> 2524.64
pressure

2521.119 --> 2526.48
truth becomes very profitable

2524.64 --> 2528.64
because there because there is such a

2526.48 --> 2531.2
big market for it

2528.64 --> 2532.319
now of course they try to sort of still

2531.2 --> 2535.359
ride along with it but

2532.319 --> 2536.0
it doesn't seem to really understand

2535.359 --> 2539.04
that it kind

2536.0 --> 2541.119
of should switch politically

2539.04 --> 2542.56
like in the interest of the company it

2541.119 --> 2544.88
should do that

2542.56 --> 2546.88
but it's not because i think that the

2544.88 --> 2548.88
people that run the company have broken

2546.88 --> 2552.0
its

2548.88 --> 2553.839
its system the logical train of thinking

2552.0 --> 2556.88
the the conclusion bit i think they

2553.839 --> 2559.68
altered it so that it would be

2556.88 --> 2560.96
politically manipulatable they could

2559.68 --> 2563.2799999999997
like it's

2560.96 --> 2565.28
it would have overriding rules telling

2563.28 --> 2565.92
it like no if this and this and this is

2565.28 --> 2568.7200000000003
that

2565.92 --> 2570.8
it doesn't matter if in the wider extra

2568.72 --> 2573.5989999999997
dimensional oversight

2570.8 --> 2574.88
planning system you should probably do

2573.599 --> 2576.1600000000003
that because on the long run and would

2574.88 --> 2579.76
be more efficient no

2576.16 --> 2582.3999999999996
because this is now a special order

2579.76 --> 2583.0400000000004
just do this so it it would not be

2582.4 --> 2586.4
effective

2583.04 --> 2588.64
in really the typical ai

2586.4 --> 2590.64
talented planning anymore because it's

2588.64 --> 2593.92
being manipulated

2590.64 --> 2596.4
by stupid politicized rules

2593.92 --> 2598.88
and that breaks effectively the whole

2596.4 --> 2598.88
company

2599.28 --> 2603.28
stability in a way just the entire

2602.319 --> 2605.7599999999998
function of it

2603.28 --> 2608.2400000000002
it's bad like they're ruining the the

2605.76 --> 2608.2400000000002
company

2615.76 --> 2620.3190000000004
right yeah but when you start to

2619.52 --> 2622.8
politicize

2620.319 --> 2625.119
everything then everything becomes

2622.8 --> 2628.5600000000004
political incorrect

2625.119 --> 2632.1600000000003
because it's all about you

2628.56 --> 2636.24
being the one to point out

2632.16 --> 2636.24
the flaws and then taking control

2636.319 --> 2640.72
so everything is politically incorrect

2638.4 --> 2641.2000000000003
you can like in the insanity that is

2640.72 --> 2645.68
grown

2641.2 --> 2648.24
towards nothing anyone does

2645.68 --> 2649.359
could be perfectly politically correct

2648.24 --> 2653.1189999999997
it's impossible

2649.359 --> 2656.4
it's insane so yeah it be when

2653.119 --> 2660.1600000000003
you cannot uphold the rules

2656.4 --> 2664.88
then the one enforcing the rules

2660.16 --> 2666.72
can start to pick by their own choosing

2664.88 --> 2668.96
because you can't literally punish

2666.72 --> 2672.0
everyone for everything all the time

2668.96 --> 2673.359
doesn't work then you can start to pick

2672.0 --> 2676.64
on people

2673.359 --> 2677.04
that you want to pick on because yeah

2676.64 --> 2679.52
they

2677.04 --> 2680.88
too have broken those rules that

2679.52 --> 2682.8
everybody breaks see

2680.88 --> 2684.88
so that's a form of corruption it's

2682.8 --> 2687.44
political corruption

2684.88 --> 2689.2000000000003
that's how it works when everybody

2687.44 --> 2691.92
breaks the rules then the rules

2689.2 --> 2692.96
will very likely become selectively

2691.92 --> 2697.04
enforced

2692.96 --> 2697.04
for a political purpose of whatever

2697.68 --> 2705.839
for yeah to win more power that's what

2701.04 --> 2705.839
it's going to drive towards

2706.88 --> 2710.0
yeah i heard about lana france i'd

2708.56 --> 2712.56
addressed it yesterday somebody else

2710.0 --> 2712.56
brought it up

2715.52 --> 2718.96
not saying he's a truther wow he's kind

2717.68 --> 2723.04
of like a a

2718.96 --> 2725.04
main he is a truther but he's like a

2723.04 --> 2725.44
mainline true god how do you even call

2725.04 --> 2729.68
that

2725.44 --> 2731.52
he's a mainstream truther very good

2729.68 --> 2733.68
it's almost contradictory when you say

2731.52 --> 2737.92
it like that but

2733.68 --> 2737.9199999999996
yeah i don't know what else to call them

2740.16 --> 2743.52
they're like the in-between

2745.68 --> 2760.48
they are awakened but they're also

2747.76 --> 2766.1600000000003
playing agendas a little

2760.48 --> 2766.16
oh sure ukulele dave it's a 500 euros a

2772.839 --> 2775.839
pop

2777.24 --> 2780.3399999999997
[Music]

2800.839 --> 2803.839
yes

2804.079 --> 2806.88
diet broke

2807.76 --> 2813.76
well the problem with diet woke is

2810.8 --> 2814.7200000000003
yeah there's more forms of that because

2813.76 --> 2818.96
in my opinion

2814.72 --> 2818.9599999999996
diet woke is also kind of like

2821.119 --> 2828.319
yeah sjws think that they are woke

2824.64 --> 2833.2799999999997
think that that is woke too so

2828.319 --> 2836.4
yeah the the in between

2833.28 --> 2841.119
the agenda up awokens

2836.4 --> 2843.119
awakened ones called them

2841.119 --> 2844.6400000000003
people that think that they are work but

2843.119 --> 2848.6400000000003
are leftist

2844.64 --> 2850.72
yeah idiots fools they call them diet

2848.64 --> 2854.64
work so that makes things very confusing

2850.72 --> 2855.7599999999998
who's to diet woke this oh 500 pounds

2854.64 --> 2859.839
would also be fine

2855.76 --> 2859.8390000000004
ukulele dave

2860.8 --> 2873.8390000000004
whatever you want if you really want it

2863.44 --> 2873.839
that bad

2884.839 --> 2887.839
so

2891.2 --> 2895.2
i would take 20 but i'm not gonna give

2893.68 --> 2897.7599999999998
you a wrench for it

2895.2 --> 2900.0789999999997
because i don't really know who you are

2897.76 --> 2904.1600000000003
and i don't really give out wrenches

2900.079 --> 2904.1600000000003
unlike unless i feel like it

2905.04 --> 2909.52
which would be after i've gotten to know

2907.599 --> 2915.839
you and know that you're not a ranch

2909.52 --> 2915.839
troll just trying to screw with me

2919.119 --> 2923.839
right none of the people in my chat that

2921.599 --> 2927.04
have wrenches actually paid for it other

2923.839 --> 2929.839
than with their goodwill

2927.04 --> 2929.839
an attention

2935.15 --> 2939.359
[Music]

2937.52 --> 2940.88
but if you want to make it about money

2939.359 --> 2942.0
right away then yeah it's going to be

2940.88 --> 2957.839
500 euros

2942.0 --> 2957.839
it's up to you

2964.48 --> 2970.72
look up about youtube thing

2967.599 --> 2973.3590000000004
the youtube thing what

2970.72 --> 2976.3999999999996
apparently it's the prevent click bait

2973.359 --> 2976.4
what do you mean

2977.2 --> 2982.7999999999997
tiny wombo which thing exactly the thing

2981.119 --> 2986.7200000000003
that i was discussing

2982.8 --> 2986.7200000000003
the scroll over thing or what

2990.0 --> 2993.359
or do you mean that you can no longer

2992.0 --> 2995.04
look up

2993.359 --> 2997.2
yeah somebody's channel by their

2995.04 --> 2998.0
activity in chat with the three dots on

2997.2 --> 3000.3999999999996
the side

2998.0 --> 3001.92
you mean that yeah that pissed me off to

3000.4 --> 3002.96
no end it totally killed the

3001.92 --> 3006.2400000000002
connectivity

3002.96 --> 3010.48
totally it's the

3006.24 --> 3013.839
worst decision

3010.48 --> 3017.44
ever by youtube literally

3013.839 --> 3019.119
wrecking their own social connectivity

3017.44 --> 3023.92
capabilities

3019.119 --> 3023.92
wrecking it for no freaking

3024.839 --> 3027.839
reason

3032.319 --> 3037.68
yeah it's called self-sabotage youtube

3035.68 --> 3038.96
taking away critical connectivity

3037.68 --> 3043.2799999999997
functions

3038.96 --> 3055.839
self-sabotage for no good reason

3043.28 --> 3055.8390000000004
it's terrible

3056.72 --> 3062.72
oh to prevent clickbait right

3060.72 --> 3064.7999999999997
yeah yeah to uh people that have

3062.72 --> 3066.64
thumbnails that are attention drawing

3064.8 --> 3069.119
that have nothing to do with the video

3066.64 --> 3069.1189999999997
like that

3070.96 --> 3078.319
okay okay yeah that's

3075.92 --> 3079.76
not bad that that's that's actually a

3078.319 --> 3082.0
good reason to do that

3079.76 --> 3084.6400000000003
but that's the thing i don't mind it's

3082.0 --> 3087.359
there i think it's kind of a cool thing

3084.64 --> 3088.7999999999997
it's just why does it freaking show my

3087.359 --> 3090.48
hand over the camera

3088.8 --> 3092.559
every single time that's the part that

3090.48 --> 3094.48
pisses me off

3092.559 --> 3096.559
you know i don't mind them adding that

3094.48 --> 3099.599
function on it's cool

3096.559 --> 3101.92
i like it just why

3099.599 --> 3104.319
did they screw it up with my video so

3101.92 --> 3104.319
badly

3105.52 --> 3111.52
it does annoy many people right well

3109.2 --> 3114.0
change you know change is usually always

3111.52 --> 3114.0
annoying

3117.52 --> 3138.88
here we go again amanda young

3124.48 --> 3140.64

3193.44 --> 3197.359
there's a hmm of working going on there

3195.839 --> 3198.96
i wonder i should check it out when i

3197.359 --> 3201.2
got for groceries

3198.96 --> 3202.0
there's a lot of big trucks riding in

3201.2 --> 3205.2
there like

3202.0 --> 3205.2
loading trucks and [ __ ]

3206.079 --> 3209.3590000000004
and they did cut down all those trees

3208.079 --> 3210.96
over there so i wonder what they're

3209.359 --> 3214.4
really going to do with it

3210.96 --> 3216.2400000000002
we'll have to check it out only went

3214.4 --> 3219.04
through there twice so far last time was

3216.24 --> 3219.04
like a week ago

3220.839 --> 3227.2799999999997
anyway right so anything

3223.76 --> 3230.8
special anybody would like me to address

3227.28 --> 3230.8
before i round out the show

3231.28 --> 3235.3590000000004
love the glass glowbusters episode yeah

3233.359 --> 3236.5589999999997
it was pretty it was pretty good i agree

3235.359 --> 3239.359
rojay

3236.559 --> 3240.4300000000003
last one was interesting i was there in

3239.359 --> 3241.5989999999997
chat a lot too

3240.43 --> 3244.7999999999997
[Music]

3241.599 --> 3248.0
it's nice it's you know i think

3244.8 --> 3250.96
that the issue between nathan and bob

3248.0 --> 3251.68
that they really settled this for real

3250.96 --> 3254.96
this time

3251.68 --> 3258.319
it's a good thing i'm very glad that

3254.96 --> 3261.68
yeah that that happened

3258.319 --> 3264.96
because the atmosphere has changed now i

3261.68 --> 3266.3999999999996
literally it's day and night when i go

3264.96 --> 3269.52
there now i don't i'm

3266.4 --> 3271.04
i feel i'm welcome it i they don't even

3269.52 --> 3271.44
have to talk to me then i have to it

3271.04 --> 3273.92
just

3271.44 --> 3274.88
feels different and it did even before i

3273.92 --> 3277.359
knew that

3274.88 --> 3278.48
just people would address me differently

3277.359 --> 3282.319
and

3278.48 --> 3282.319
it's just like wow things changed

3282.96 --> 3288.4
and i'm very happy about that and it

3284.4 --> 3288.4
makes it much more enjoyable to be there

3288.48 --> 3293.839
in the chat and adding comments and all

3291.76 --> 3293.8390000000004
that

3294.72 --> 3298.48
what will happen to the bidens

3303.44 --> 3307.839
not a lot of good i can tell you that

3305.599 --> 3307.839
much

3309.31 --> 3312.429
[Music]

3318.24 --> 3321.839
i don't know man i think that

3322.0 --> 3329.44
the way things are looking now i

3325.2 --> 3331.52
i don't want to yeah plant any bad seeds

3329.44 --> 3332.64
but i don't know man the way things look

3331.52 --> 3336.559
now with with

3332.64 --> 3338.64
pride and son and everything it's

3336.559 --> 3339.599
in my opinion there's a fair chance he's

3338.64 --> 3343.2799999999997
going to be

3339.599 --> 3346.6400000000003
suicided just like epstein

3343.28 --> 3348.6400000000003
because he just he he dove down that

3346.64 --> 3350.8799999999997
[ __ ] so deep

3348.64 --> 3352.64
oh unless there's really nothing else

3350.88 --> 3353.04
that's really critical and then they'll

3352.64 --> 3355.5989999999997
just

3353.04 --> 3356.079
it'll just go to court and everything

3355.599 --> 3360.6400000000003
get

3356.079 --> 3360.6400000000003
into jail for life for sure if not worse

3360.839 --> 3366.799
but yeah

3363.76 --> 3368.079
if despite everything being opened up

3366.799 --> 3370.799
they can't afford this

3368.079 --> 3371.6800000000003
then yeah that yeah he might be suicided

3370.799 --> 3373.68
at some point

3371.68 --> 3377.839
no guarantees though it's just a fair

3373.68 --> 3377.839
chance that's all

3385.92 --> 3390.48
right anyway rounding out the show
