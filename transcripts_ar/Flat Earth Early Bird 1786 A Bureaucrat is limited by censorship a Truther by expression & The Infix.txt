178.44 --> 183.76
the show but I mean I got all this stuff

180.76 --> 186.07999999999998
bottled up in me so I'm just going to

183.76 --> 190.04
like do a double speed

186.08 --> 190.04000000000002
show I'm just going to rush

191.28 --> 197.64000000000001
it right anyway how are you

193.959 --> 202.64000000000001
doing elections here have happened

197.64 --> 202.64
and was a little bit unexpected

203.159 --> 208.07999999999998
result still see what's going to happen

208.68 --> 215.4
now but

211.84 --> 218.76
apparently uh pvv

215.4 --> 221.48000000000002
one with a

218.76 --> 225.07999999999998
landslide so now I'm going to have to

221.48 --> 228.0
enjoy everybody in the word in the world

225.08 --> 229.64000000000001
like naming his name and getting it

228.0 --> 232.28
absolutely

229.64 --> 235.76
wrong because I mean Dutch names are

232.28 --> 238.48
just so freaking difficult for English

235.76 --> 242.39999999999998
people right so it's going to be called

238.48 --> 245.48
GT why Wilders a lot yeah Girt Wilders

242.4 --> 249.87900000000002
that's why everybody calls him Girt hey

245.48 --> 254.92
Girt how you doing GT yeah it's not GT

249.879 --> 254.92
it's a a difficult

257.959 --> 264.919
a not GT yeah you sound like a [ __ ]

262.52 --> 266.639
orc when you say it like that because

264.919 --> 268.59999999999997
you're a dumbass you don't know how to

266.639 --> 272.639
pronunciate foreign

268.6 --> 274.68
languages pronunciate

272.639 --> 279.12
it's

274.68 --> 283.919
Wilders not Girt Wilder so enjoy that

279.12 --> 283.919
enjoy hearing dirt Wilders a

286.32 --> 292.639
lot

288.32 --> 294.0
right so apparently they won which is a

292.639 --> 297.12
mixed

294.0 --> 299.84
bag but one thing is

297.12 --> 303.28000000000003
certain they were very much much

299.84 --> 304.75899999999996
anti-immigration which is in this

303.28 --> 308.28
particular

304.759 --> 311.40000000000003
time kind of like a good thing so I hope

308.28 --> 313.79999999999995
he's going to actually stick to that and

311.4 --> 317.84
not

313.8 --> 321.16
like basically pull a turn coat like all

317.84 --> 324.52
the other cartel parties which I can't

321.16 --> 328.0
say he's not really a part

324.52 --> 330.75899999999996
of although he seems to be opposition

328.0 --> 334.199
supposedly right like for for

330.759 --> 337.199
democracy I don't trust that

334.199 --> 337.199
guy

338.039 --> 343.4
so yeah expect some weird things to play

344.4 --> 350.23999999999995
out like them secretly being friends

347.44 --> 353.36
with the cartel parties and all that I

350.24 --> 358.039
don't trust them at all I kind of expect

353.36 --> 361.16
them to just fully go after the farmers

358.039 --> 364.0
now like this

361.16 --> 366.56
party and just get Tri State through I

364.0 --> 369.08
think that that's what's going to happen

366.56 --> 369.08
but I don't

370.319 --> 377.03900000000004
know I just know that form for democracy

373.84 --> 379.96
has been like put in a corner they

377.039 --> 379.96
apparently have

380.44 --> 386.12
like that's not it might be just rumors

383.16 --> 389.08000000000004
but there's like so many rumors crazy

386.12 --> 393.72
rumors against forum for democracy it's

389.08 --> 396.0
it's just weird man getting

393.72 --> 397.24
attacked now there's rumors that they

396.0 --> 400.919
have

397.24 --> 400.919

[Music]

545.399 --> 551.2
maybe they just all left or something

548.12 --> 554.519
cuz I W I have been an hour late

551.2 --> 554.519

555.72 --> 562.2
know I need a a new alarm clock system

560.04 --> 564.4399999999999
it's just that with this new phone the

562.2 --> 567.6400000000001
alarm clock is

564.44 --> 570.8800000000001
horrendous cuz you can't just turn it

567.64 --> 573.56
off can't set the alarm sound I can't

570.88 --> 577.36
turn it off like you have to like go

573.56 --> 579.8
into the settings and turn the alarm off

577.36 --> 582.88
manually you can't just turn it off with

579.8 --> 585.519
a button it's really agitating so I

582.88 --> 588.12
haven't really been using it and kind of

585.519 --> 591.079
like going on intuition and that really

588.12 --> 594.68
doesn't work out sometimes like today

591.079 --> 594.68
even though I didn't even go to bed that

596.16 --> 601.12
late Jack was full of conspiratard

602.56 --> 611.959
okay you expected more accent and the

606.0 --> 615.079
guru type that is so racist

611.959 --> 616.92
clut that's exactly what Chief has

615.079 --> 620.399
fighting that

616.92 --> 623.8
stereotype my God you think I'd follow

620.399 --> 625.279

665.76 --> 673.88
teret but then there wasn't a tweet that

675.38 --> 678.86
[Music]

687.959 --> 690.959
show

699.72 --> 706.2
so let's turn that raging computer

703.72 --> 706.2
computer

708.0 --> 712.68
off hey expeditious Expedition truth

711.639 --> 716.44

712.68 --> 718.5999999999999
you I always call you expeditious

716.44 --> 721.1800000000001
truth I don't know why maybe it's

718.6 --> 724.37
because it's more

721.18 --> 724.37
[Music]

727.49 --> 730.799
[Music]

737.48 --> 741.88
fluid hey LSG good to see

[Music]

755.12 --> 759.76
right so for those that weren't there

757.04 --> 762.519
like the first minute of my live stream

759.76 --> 765.24
yeah pvv

762.519 --> 768.32
one so you're going to heard the name

765.24 --> 770.519
Gert World Wilders a lot because English

768.32 --> 773.519
can't actually pronounce Dutch names at

770.519 --> 775.36
all like even when they make a lot of

773.519 --> 777.72
effort they still can't because they're

775.36 --> 777.72
kind of

777.839 --> 780.839
[ __ ]

784.639 --> 789.12
so I I'm going to be listening Info Wars

787.24 --> 792.12
I'm going to be judging you on your

789.12 --> 792.12
pronunciation

794.04 --> 797.04
skills

807.76 --> 810.76
anyway

827.04 --> 834.4399999999999
right but anyway how how they're going

829.72 --> 837.6
to roll it out we'll see maybe G Wilders

834.44 --> 839.44
is really going to go after the left

837.6 --> 840.9590000000001
which we do have and there are

839.44 --> 844.759
horrendous

840.959 --> 847.1199999999999
people like really [ __ ] like people

844.759 --> 847.12
that

847.24 --> 854.6
I at minimum would ban from the country

850.959 --> 858.04
permanently like you you're not allowed

854.6 --> 858.0400000000001
in this country ever

859.04 --> 865.68
again that's what I probably would end

861.399 --> 870.32
up doing if not just straight on a

865.68 --> 875.4799999999999
fire but I mean that that would never

870.32 --> 875.48
be actually happening of course in this

876.759 --> 883.36
country unless somebody's willing to go

879.48 --> 883.36
full Hitler on everybody

887.92 --> 894.24

890.56 --> 894.2399999999999

we not know what the [ __ ] to call

1171.159 --> 1178.64
that this is weird anyway yeah hello

1175.0 --> 1178.64
Aries 106 and Titan

1188.99 --> 1192.69
[Music]

1195.08 --> 1201.1999999999998
long right but anyway if you call it a

1198.0 --> 1203.2
pre preix that's at least intuitively

1201.2 --> 1206.24
people would understand what I

1203.2 --> 1210.4
meant I don't know if it's technically

1206.24 --> 1213.88
the right word for it but yeah Van van

1210.4 --> 1216.4
is a prefix it's not a a middle

1213.88 --> 1219.24
name that was my point don't know why

1216.4 --> 1219.24
that took so long

1227.159 --> 1230.159
sorry

1232.72 --> 1237.64
so it mean from

1235.96 --> 1241.0
yeah

1237.64 --> 1244.2
vanan would be

1241.0 --> 1245.919
from the neighborhood or from Neighbors

1244.2 --> 1248.52
or the

1245.919 --> 1251.7990000000002
neighborhood like with water down it's

1248.52 --> 1251.799
like it's from

1254.6 --> 1258.6399999999999
something but it like it would never be

1256.96 --> 1262.32
like your last name's never going to be

1258.64 --> 1264.2
like the name of a city like nobody's

1262.32 --> 1267.8799999999999
last name is Amsterdam so it's never

1264.2 --> 1270.64
like fun Amsterdam but like it's it's

1267.88 --> 1274.0390000000002
like originally land from this is where

1270.64 --> 1274.039
you come from so it's

1275.36 --> 1280.8799999999999
like Von stranden from the beach

1279.2 --> 1284.799
seriously there's probably people that

1280.88 --> 1286.72
are called like Fon F Str or something

1284.799 --> 1289.32
out there it's weird but I mean it

1286.72 --> 1291.1200000000001
probably exists because that's kind of

1289.32 --> 1292.76
like how it's used it's like this is

1291.12 --> 1297.4799999999998
where you're

1292.76 --> 1299.279
from it's how a lot of last names were

1297.48 --> 1301.799
kind of

1299.279 --> 1304.32
picked because last names were

1301.799 --> 1307.6
apparently there during the Napoleon era

1304.32 --> 1311.9189999999999
they got they were created before that

1307.6 --> 1314.799
people didn't have like an official last

1311.919 --> 1317.039
name and so everybody across Europe was

1314.799 --> 1319.32
just kind of like forced to like pick a

1317.039 --> 1322.2
family name and and people picked all

1319.32 --> 1324.799
kinds of weird random things mostly

1322.2 --> 1328.0
Things based on their profession and

1324.799 --> 1328.0
sometimes really weird

1330.279 --> 1334.52
things and that's kind of where it came

1336.12 --> 1344.1589999999999
from wner Von Brown yeah he's

1341.0 --> 1348.32
from brown but Brown is

1344.159 --> 1349.64
also literally the color brown with it o

1348.32 --> 1355.76
WN

1349.64 --> 1358.4
right so what that means is brown coal

1355.76 --> 1362.279
mining so wner from

1358.4 --> 1366.24
Brown is like a reference to like his

1362.279 --> 1366.24
ancestors were probably coal

1368.2 --> 1374.24
miners see that's what fun Brown really

1372.0 --> 1376.96
stands for it's like oh fun Brown so you

1374.24 --> 1379.96
were your ancestors were Brown coal

1376.96 --> 1379.96
miners

1388.38 --> 1396.3600000000001
[Music]

1392.44 --> 1398.679
see like just like SWAT aeger is also

1396.36 --> 1398.6789999999999
like

1398.84 --> 1403.799
similar that's also a reference to coal

1403.96 --> 1409.88
miners a black

1406.88 --> 1409.88
ho

1412.85 --> 1416.04
[Music]

1418.88 --> 1424.4
right it's logical because think of the

1421.84 --> 1426.8799999999999
era when it is right so we're talking

1424.4 --> 1429.96
the Napoleon

1426.88 --> 1432.24
era that's like early very early

1429.96 --> 1435.159
beginnings of industrialization when

1432.24 --> 1439.679
gunpowder was like really hitting it

1435.159 --> 1443.3600000000001
off and yeah there was was a lot of coal

1439.679 --> 1445.679
mining for all kinds of things so it's

1443.36 --> 1447.9599999999998
not surprising that a lot of people in

1445.679 --> 1451.039
Europe especially the

1447.96 --> 1455.24
mainland have last names that are based

1451.039 --> 1457.4
on coal mining of some sort because that

1455.24 --> 1461.2
was right when people were forced to

1457.4 --> 1463.44
choose back a family name that was a

1461.2 --> 1466.44
really big like a a widespread

1463.44 --> 1468.799
profession a lot of people did that see

1466.44 --> 1471.64
that's how that came to be

1468.799 --> 1471.6399999999999
interesting isn't

1473.16 --> 1480.269
[Music]

1496.76 --> 1499.76
it

1506.52 --> 1511.8799999999999
all right yeah and the sun clutch the

1508.679 --> 1515.279
whole Sun thing that's typically nor

1511.88 --> 1518.6000000000001
that's uh Scandinavian is that where

1515.279 --> 1520.96
they that's where because they have a

1518.6 --> 1522.6
much older tradition to be the son of

1520.96 --> 1524.24
this like I'm the son of that and he's

1522.6 --> 1527.279
the son of him and he's the son of them

1524.24 --> 1528.799
and that was like a a last name sort of

1527.279 --> 1531.72
use

1528.799 --> 1531.72
that's even pre-

1533.72 --> 1539.039
Napoleon so it has different Roots as to

1536.72 --> 1541.279
how it became

1539.039 --> 1546.919
manifest that's why you have a lot of

1541.279 --> 1546.919
sons in last names in Scandinavian

1553.919 --> 1558.96
countries which by the way also included

1556.6 --> 1561.7199999999998
England in a way

1558.96 --> 1563.52
they they did like think Vikings like

1561.72 --> 1567.32
they everywhere they touched yeah you

1563.52 --> 1569.279
have lots of last names with sun in

1567.32 --> 1572.74
[Music]

1569.279 --> 1576.559
it and and regular

1572.74 --> 1580.48
[Music]

1576.559 --> 1583.48
names like first names too

1580.48 --> 1583.48
like

1583.64 --> 1589.48
yson and not technically no it's it's

1586.72 --> 1592.0
not for names I got that wrong no it is

1589.48 --> 1595.679
it is really always like middle last

1592.0 --> 1595.679
names never first

1597.159 --> 1601.5200000000002
names but like for example there's like

1599.6 --> 1605.84
a cartoon in the Netherlands very

1601.52 --> 1609.12
familiar or with the oldies by now yon

1605.84 --> 1612.32
Json it's like yon

1609.12 --> 1615.559
John son of

1612.32 --> 1618.0
JN oh that's still like yeah that's

1615.559 --> 1619.76
actually kind of Dutch name too like

1618.0 --> 1623.159
it's not uncommon

1619.76 --> 1628.08
here so it's around here in

1623.159 --> 1631.48
England and Scandinavia where sun is

1628.08 --> 1631.48
typically in the last

1632.48 --> 1638.48
name right so the profession

1635.48 --> 1639.679
isn't is not emphasized in that last

1638.48 --> 1644.3600000000001
name

1639.679 --> 1648.039
type but the who you came from

1644.36 --> 1651.6789999999999
family is actually more prominent role

1648.039 --> 1654.8799999999999
within their last name interesting

1651.679 --> 1654.88
right the

1663.399 --> 1670.32
difference Spanish children take on both

1666.64 --> 1670.3200000000002
Mother's and Father's surname

1674.64 --> 1681.76
hm

1676.519 --> 1684.1200000000001
yeah that's hilarious friend that's

1681.76 --> 1685.6
twice the same surname that's that's

1684.12 --> 1688.6399999999999
kind of freaky

1685.6 --> 1692.519
though it's

1688.64 --> 1694.679
like like I hope they're not too closely

1692.519 --> 1698.36
related you

1694.679 --> 1703.0
know it's kind of freaky if it's going

1698.36 --> 1703.0
to bring some questions from

1706.44 --> 1712.64
people

1708.88 --> 1712.64
hello by the way Rick back to see

1718.08 --> 1724.6789999999999
you nobility had last names way before

1721.2 --> 1727.0
yeah of course Aries 106 yeah but that's

1724.679 --> 1729.24
the whole point the nobility had the

1727.0 --> 1731.919
last names because it was so important

1729.24 --> 1735.48
for the bloodline

1731.919 --> 1738.3990000000001
Etc right and people were just peons

1735.48 --> 1740.2
they don't give a [ __ ] like as long as

1738.399 --> 1742.6
you respond to the name that you're

1740.2 --> 1745.039
being called like they didn't give a

1742.6 --> 1746.8799999999999
[ __ ] what the hell you did who the hell

1745.039 --> 1749.24
you screwed and all

1746.88 --> 1750.7600000000002
that as long as you just did what you

1749.24 --> 1753.6
told but

1750.76 --> 1757.36
later supposedly during the Napoleon

1753.6 --> 1759.1589999999999
Revolution suddenly like oh down with

1757.36 --> 1762.1589999999999
the

1759.159 --> 1764.0
nobility everyone gets a last name now

1762.159 --> 1766.8400000000001
everyone is a

1764.0 --> 1769.32
noble and then everybody made up made up

1766.84 --> 1769.32
last name

1788.2 --> 1791.96
H let me check

1792.96 --> 1800.679
[Music]

1796.08 --> 1800.6789999999999
that h Google seem to know

1825.76 --> 1832.1589999999999
it fun there

1829.159 --> 1832.159
Trump

1832.32 --> 1836.279
from yeah you might be

1836.48 --> 1840.72
right yeah from what it shows

1841.48 --> 1847.84
here yeah the

1844.88 --> 1851.0
van those are

1847.84 --> 1853.6399999999999
like why what the hell is that in

1851.0 --> 1853.64
English

1856.24 --> 1861.24
though

1857.88 --> 1866.0800000000002
infix is that what it's called it's an

1861.24 --> 1868.519
infix okay I guess it's an infix that's

1866.08 --> 1871.9189999999999
a weird little word I'm going to put it

1868.519 --> 1871.919
in the title thank you for

1875.1 --> 1879.4399999999998
[Music]

1876.72 --> 1881.84
that oh [ __ ] I don't have any more room

1879.44 --> 1881.8400000000001
in the

1886.159 --> 1889.159
title

1889.6 --> 1900.1999999999998
[Music]

1896.36 --> 1903.36
oh I made it fit I took the only out of

1900.2 --> 1903.3600000000001
the title and now it

1905.679 --> 1908.679
fits

1916.159 --> 1920.8400000000001
almost

1918.12 --> 1922.5189999999998
yeah okay what do you think I like that

1920.84 --> 1925.24
I want to put that word in it we spent

1922.519 --> 1926.6
so much time on trying to figure it out

1925.24 --> 1928.3990000000001
it's got to be in the title and it's

1926.6 --> 1931.4399999999998
kind of funny because it reminds me of

1928.399 --> 1934.76
like the fix is in right like it's been

1931.44 --> 1937.3990000000001
fixed like an election rigging and the

1934.76 --> 1939.279
infix it just immediately reminded me

1937.399 --> 1942.32
about

1939.279 --> 1946.08
that even though it's just a technical

1942.32 --> 1948.4399999999998
word how how funny is

1946.08 --> 1951.4399999999998
that isn't that just more proof of

1948.44 --> 1955.3990000000001
design that things just always come

1951.44 --> 1955.3990000000001
together it it's so

1956.159 --> 1959.159
magical

1960.36 --> 1963.57
[Music]

1966.24 --> 1970.519
anyway you hadn't heard of infix before

1968.799 --> 1972.72
no me NE neither I've never heard of

1970.519 --> 1972.72
that

1973.72 --> 1983.32
word I just Googled it but t F I did

1978.08 --> 1986.1999999999998
recognize the word t f from way back in

1983.32 --> 1989.24
school where I had to learn those things

1986.2 --> 1991.3600000000001
yeah to be fair in like Middle School I

1989.24 --> 1994.36
was much better at English than I was in

1991.36 --> 1994.36
Dutch

1994.639 --> 2002.399
really I like had a pretty high score in

1997.159 --> 2007.24
my English Dutch not so much why because

2002.399 --> 2010.9189999999999
Dutch actually is much more difficult I

2007.24 --> 2014.159
mean I can pronounce it like I can speak

2010.919 --> 2017.6000000000001
Dutch very well I know all the the

2014.159 --> 2020.6000000000001
verbal sound tricks I can pronounce like

2017.6 --> 2022.8799999999999
the best of them I really can almost

2020.6 --> 2026.0
like one of those old professors in that

2022.88 --> 2027.96
sense it's just the writing part man

2026.0 --> 2031.32
holy

2027.96 --> 2033.799
[ __ ] I mean I can write it but it is

2031.32 --> 2036.4399999999998
freaking difficult like it's more

2033.799 --> 2037.76
difficult to than English like in some

2036.44 --> 2040.519
cases

2037.76 --> 2043.519
especially when the freaking D

2040.519 --> 2046.44
DTS are involved it drives me

2043.519 --> 2048.28
nuts I'm not the only one by the way

2046.44 --> 2050.56
there's a lot of people that are not

2048.28 --> 2051.21
super good at writing it but very good

2050.56 --> 2052.399
at

2051.21 --> 2055.76
[Music]

2052.399 --> 2058.7599999999998
speaking cuz there's just so much in the

2055.76 --> 2061.28
actual speech like there's a whole

2058.76 --> 2062.8790000000004
microcosm like hidden within the Dutch

2061.28 --> 2065.8790000000004
language that

2062.879 --> 2068.879
just you only see in

2065.879 --> 2068.879
Dutch

2070.679 --> 2080.539
but writing it can be a pain in the

where English man dude I'm so freaking

2104.119 --> 2107.2000000000003
high in English

2107.72 --> 2113.24
man now we know what you mean a high

2110.88 --> 2115.92
score in English that's what you meant

2113.24 --> 2119.9599999999996
to say ter you should definitely not

2115.92 --> 2119.96
separate the score from that

2125.16 --> 2128.359

y

2163.0 --> 2169.72
Hy was more difficult

2165.319 --> 2175.2
too H I guess but English was just made

2169.72 --> 2177.0
to be brilliant and easily it was like

2175.2 --> 2179.7599999999998
going in Dungeons and Dragons

2177.0 --> 2182.96
terminology like English really is

2179.76 --> 2185.2000000000003
common like it is the common like it is

2182.96 --> 2187.48
the language just

2185.2 --> 2190.359
just exposed

2187.48 --> 2192.88
any exotic culture that's been

2190.359 --> 2197.2
completely isolated to different samples

2192.88 --> 2200.119
of language and almost all of them will

2197.2 --> 2203.04
get English first although some might

2200.119 --> 2205.48
like really have weird dis dispositions

2203.04 --> 2208.8
toward things like French or something

2205.48 --> 2211.839
that happens apparently but like English

2208.8 --> 2218.6800000000003
is really like the tongue that just

2211.839 --> 2218.68
everybody in the world can get quickly

2219.16 --> 2222.3999999999996
that's what's so amazing about

2226.44 --> 2232.0
it comedy bit

2229.76 --> 2234.48
okay right hope you're all enjoying the

2232.0 --> 2238.2
show it's a very short show but I'm

2234.48 --> 2242.04
doing my best to make something out of

2238.2 --> 2244.96
it oh that damn that's some hippy that's

2242.04 --> 2249.92
some old 70 [ __ ]

2244.96 --> 2249.92
there or at least it looks like that

2250.359 --> 2257.7599999999998
clutch there like immediately shout that

2253.4 --> 2257.76
shouts like that's a freaking 70s

2259.16 --> 2263.72
hippie I'll take a look later thanks for

2261.599 --> 2263.7200000000003
the

2274.359 --> 2281.0
link spelling in English is a disaster

2278.68 --> 2283.2799999999997
you think I don't think so I think it's

2281.0 --> 2283.28
very

2287.359 --> 2294.56
doable you're just whiny and complaining

2290.359 --> 2296.64
about your own very very easy lucky to

2294.56 --> 2301.7599999999998
have language there Aries

2296.64 --> 2301.7599999999998
106 have you ever tried spelling in

2301.839 --> 2307.24
Dutch do you even know any other

2304.2 --> 2310.64
language I mean

2307.24 --> 2312.52
English spelling is really pretty

2310.64 --> 2316.2
straightforward I mean there's some

2312.52 --> 2319.119
weird letter thing combination thingies

2316.2 --> 2321.04
but I mean that's really all European

2319.119 --> 2324.4500000000003
languages

2321.04 --> 2327.48
so it shouldn't be that

2324.45 --> 2331.52
[Music]

2327.48 --> 2333.359
difficult you don't know our well if

2331.52 --> 2336.24
you're not if you can't even spell my

2333.359 --> 2338.2799999999997
name right yeah then then I guess it's

2336.24 --> 2341.0789999999997
really

2338.28 --> 2344.0
difficult in English can be whack sure

2341.079 --> 2348.48
it can be but I mean give me an

2344.0 --> 2348.48
example what's so incredibly

2352.44 --> 2359.44
difficult I mean I even know the word

2357.76 --> 2361.76
antidisestablishmentarianism and I can

2359.44 --> 2364.2400000000002
spell it yeah probably one of the

2361.76 --> 2367.7200000000003
longest words that even

2364.24 --> 2372.04
exists that is actually a meaningful

2367.72 --> 2374.4399999999996
word it's like it's not that

2372.04 --> 2376.88
difficult maybe I'm just really good at

2374.44 --> 2376.88
it I don't

2378.4 --> 2384.76
know it's just that I had English in

2381.56 --> 2386.599
school and I kind of never stopped being

2384.76 --> 2388.2400000000002
like that it's like oh yeah more English

2386.599 --> 2390.1600000000003
oh I need to learn more I need to get it

2388.24 --> 2393.68
right I need to pronounce it right I

2390.16 --> 2396.3999999999996
never stopped doing that my entire

2393.68 --> 2398.839
life just oh no I want to get the engl

2396.4 --> 2402.76
engl right I want I want to

2398.839 --> 2405.56
be beh beholden like somebody seeing it

2402.76 --> 2407.6400000000003
hearing it and then like oh I just want

2405.56 --> 2409.359
that I want to be good at English I

2407.64 --> 2411.96
always wanted to be good at English

2409.359 --> 2414.839
since ever since I

2411.96 --> 2417.2
watched Saturday morning cartoons which

2414.839 --> 2419.7999999999997
were all English with Dutch subtitles I

2417.2 --> 2423.2
just I was like I'm going to master this

2419.8 --> 2423.2000000000003
I'm going to be so good at

2424.52 --> 2433.04
this and I have

2427.68 --> 2433.9199999999996
nobody told me that I had to do that no

2433.04 --> 2438.119
it's

2433.92 --> 2441.2400000000002
just I like this I feel there's a future

2438.119 --> 2444.0
in this for me I'm going to master this

2441.24 --> 2446.04
and I decided it be when I was still a

2444.0 --> 2448.119
little kid when my parents weren't even

2446.04 --> 2449.52
confronting me with like hey later

2448.119 --> 2450.28
you're going to have to figure out like

2449.52 --> 2452.8
a

2450.28 --> 2455.3190000000004
profession like no it was just me I

2452.8 --> 2458.319
English I want

2455.319 --> 2458.319
it

2464.599 --> 2469.52
right and and and what a gift the

2467.44 --> 2473.76
language is I mean because of all that

2469.52 --> 2476.319
love like I got to know Black Adder and

2473.76 --> 2480.96
Monty Pyon

2476.319 --> 2484.48
movies and it's just like yeah I'm very

2480.96 --> 2488.64
happy that English has like been a big

2484.48 --> 2488.64
part in my life very happy with

2490.67 --> 2497.079
[Music]

2492.599 --> 2498.7200000000003
that which All European languages you

2497.079 --> 2501.8390000000004
have understand

2498.72 --> 2504.9599999999996
what that's not a properly constructed

2501.839 --> 2507.48
sentence there but

2504.96 --> 2511.92
uh I get

2507.48 --> 2517.96
German I can like

2511.92 --> 2522.0
30 to 70% follow a German

2517.96 --> 2524.52
Conversation I can the same percentage

2522.0 --> 2527.2
like follow like a Spanish conversation

2524.52 --> 2529.119
or even a French conversation like I I

2527.2 --> 2531.04
can kind of make out what they're saying

2529.119 --> 2533.599
it's just like entire bits will

2531.04 --> 2537.0
completely elude me what they're

2533.599 --> 2540.44
saying but I can like the structure is

2537.0 --> 2540.44
very close all of

2541.079 --> 2548.1600000000003
it I mean ethologically all of it is

2544.359 --> 2551.48
related in ways or in the sense that

2548.16 --> 2554.0789999999997
English is like has taken from all these

2551.48 --> 2557.64
languages and Dutch

2554.079 --> 2559.2000000000003
also Dutch is like an English that's

2557.64 --> 2561.7999999999997
like more

2559.2 --> 2564.319
Inland like Dutch really is like a more

2561.8 --> 2569.0
Inland type of English in a

2564.319 --> 2574.2
way or a halfway going towards being

2569.0 --> 2574.2
English it's like a half English almost

2575.16 --> 2581.48
Dutch so for me all the languages in

2579.079 --> 2584.0
Europe are like very

2581.48 --> 2585.48
recognizable and I can hear by how

2584.0 --> 2588.16
they're talking like where they're

2585.48 --> 2590.04
coming from like I can even by now

2588.16 --> 2591.2
distinguish the difference between like

2590.04 --> 2595.119
an

2591.2 --> 2598.0
Italian a person from Spain or

2595.119 --> 2598.0
Portuguese

2601.96 --> 2609.599
person and I can also like distinguish

2605.359 --> 2612.88
the difference between a Dane and a

2609.599 --> 2616.3590000000004
German I'm very proud of that now for me

2612.88 --> 2619.76
it's really tough to keep the the actual

2616.359 --> 2623.359
Scandinavian languages apart so as soon

2619.76 --> 2626.3190000000004
as go beyond Danes more further north I

2623.359 --> 2631.68
can't keep those apart I can't keep

2626.319 --> 2632.88
Norse and Swedish and Finnish apart I

2631.68 --> 2635.5989999999997
not

2632.88 --> 2638.4
really it would take me a longer time

2635.599 --> 2640.7200000000003
listening to them saying things and then

2638.4 --> 2643.64
recognizing it by oh wait it's moving

2640.72 --> 2647.2799999999997
more towards that so it's probably more

2643.64 --> 2650.5989999999997
likely Norse Swedish or

2647.28 --> 2652.119
Finnish but it's more difficult for me

2650.599 --> 2654.7200000000003
to figure

2652.119 --> 2656.44
out but pretty much all the countries

2654.72 --> 2660.0
that surround the Netherlands and even a

2656.44 --> 2660.0
bit further south like

2663.04 --> 2668.0
yeah I can figure out what they're say

2674.04 --> 2679.0
like half of the times it's not perfect

2676.559 --> 2680.2000000000003
right I'm not actually really familiar

2679.0 --> 2684.0
with the

2680.2 --> 2687.9199999999996
languages I mean if any German and

2684.0 --> 2690.0
Spanish better because I also well I had

2687.92 --> 2693.119
we went on vacation to Spain so I had a

2690.0 --> 2695.0
lot of like Comm direct communication

2693.119 --> 2698.8
training with Spanish people but then we

2695.0 --> 2702.64
always ended up talking [ __ ]

2698.8 --> 2704.76
Spanglish English in a very Spanish way

2702.64 --> 2706.72
that just happened so that eventually

2704.76 --> 2708.559
like I didn't continue talking Spanish

2706.72 --> 2710.68
they were just interested in learning

2708.559 --> 2714.44
English like I had a friend there in

2710.68 --> 2715.96
Spain he literally went to study English

2714.44 --> 2718.28
so he was just always like we were

2715.96 --> 2723.28
talking English we didn't speak Spanish

2718.28 --> 2723.28
then so never really got further with

2724.079 --> 2731.52
that and German is really very similar

2728.96 --> 2734.52
to Dutch in many many

2731.52 --> 2734.52
ways

2736.8 --> 2744.04
like like Belgium like Belgium an

2740.44 --> 2746.04
outsider would barely be able to even

2744.04 --> 2748.24
tell the difference apart between

2746.04 --> 2751.079
Belgium and Dutch there are very

2748.24 --> 2753.64
distinct differences though well to me

2751.079 --> 2756.52
it's like German is just as much

2753.64 --> 2758.7599999999998
different except a little bit fur

2756.52 --> 2761.559
there they have like completely

2758.76 --> 2764.6400000000003
different things in there too but it is

2761.559 --> 2767.0
just the similarities are just very tell

2764.64 --> 2770.2799999999997
you can

2767.0 --> 2773.119
tell like if a Dutch person like never

2770.28 --> 2775.0
heard the German never knew anything

2773.119 --> 2778.2000000000003
German and they would hear it they would

2775.0 --> 2781.599
immediately recognize things because

2778.2 --> 2784.2
well Dutch language originated from

2781.599 --> 2787.76
German

2784.2 --> 2791.9199999999996
partially it's like half German or

2787.76 --> 2794.2400000000002
outskirt German Deets is how it started

2791.92 --> 2798.079
before the Netherlands was

2794.24 --> 2803.04
even you know its its own

2798.079 --> 2803.04
country all right atmology language

2804.4 --> 2810.04
woohoo it is interesting though to me I

2808.04 --> 2812.8
hope it's interesting to you too in this

2810.04 --> 2815.5589999999997
very very short early bird

2812.8 --> 2817.2400000000002
show I did not really address the title

2815.559 --> 2820.76
to too much although it was like a

2817.24 --> 2823.839
general phrase I will before I end the

2820.76 --> 2828.4
show right bureaucrat is limited by

2823.839 --> 2828.4
censorship a truth or by

2830.68 --> 2837.52
expression it should be pretty

2834.44 --> 2840.079
straightforward to understand that

2837.52 --> 2843.16
right because a

2840.079 --> 2845.319
bureaucrat they have to hold themselves

2843.16 --> 2846.839
by these rules that are imposed onto

2845.319 --> 2850.72
them

2846.839 --> 2853.5589999999997
by the government by the well by the

2850.72 --> 2856.359
bureaucracy right but they might want to

2853.559 --> 2860.1600000000003
share all these things but they can't or

2856.359 --> 2863.0789999999997
they're afraid to so they are limited by

2860.16 --> 2864.96
the censorship that they are that are

2863.079 --> 2869.04
their tools they're limited by their own

2864.96 --> 2872.2400000000002
tools right while the truther is exactly

2869.04 --> 2874.72
the opposite issue there is no system

2872.24 --> 2876.5989999999997
that's limiting

2874.72 --> 2879.3999999999996
them

2876.599 --> 2881.92
the only limit is their own ability to

2879.4 --> 2881.92
express

2883.64 --> 2888.72
it and I that kind of stood out to me in

2886.48 --> 2889.599
that sense a bureaucrat and a truther

2888.72 --> 2894.5499999999997
are

2889.599 --> 2896.599
like yin yang they're like exactly the

2894.55 --> 2898.8390000000004
[Music]

2896.599 --> 2901.599
opposite right in their mindset a

2898.839 --> 2903.24
truther always wants to expose but he's

2901.599 --> 2905.76
limited by his expression of

2903.24 --> 2908.24
communication by being understand

2905.76 --> 2910.48
understood in what he's trying to convey

2908.24 --> 2913.4399999999996
right that's always the limit for a

2910.48 --> 2915.44
truther but a bureaucrat they might know

2913.44 --> 2919.0
all these things

2915.44 --> 2921.079
but they're not allowed to do these

2919.0 --> 2923.28
communications in certain way they're

2921.079 --> 2926.1600000000003
not allowed to say couple of things they

2923.28 --> 2928.0
have to withhold inform they're limited

2926.16 --> 2930.839
by the

2928.0 --> 2934.079
censorship and just wanted to highlight

2930.839 --> 2936.0789999999997
that contrast for a bit and that's why I

2934.079 --> 2939.119
put it in the the title in the show

2936.079 --> 2943.6400000000003
yesterday because I just thought of

2939.119 --> 2943.6400000000003
that wanted to make you think of it

2945.119 --> 2948.839
too love to see a full show on that

2947.76 --> 2951.8390000000004
title in the

2948.839 --> 2951.839
future

2952.119 --> 2957.1600000000003
Yeah well yeah why

2954.64 --> 2959.319
not we could bring it back up as a

2957.16 --> 2961.2799999999997
subject I mean we can just talk about it

2959.319 --> 2962.92
just because it's not in the title

2961.28 --> 2964.119
doesn't mean that you can't talk about

2962.92 --> 2966.799
it

2964.119 --> 2970.2400000000002
right so if if you think that's a really

2966.799 --> 2973.24
worthy thing to look into rickb then

2970.24 --> 2975.5989999999997
bring it back up remind me about it

2973.24 --> 2977.2
tomorrow or another show where you're

2975.599 --> 2980.4
there and we'll continue the

2977.2 --> 2980.3999999999996
conversation what do you

2989.359 --> 2995.0
think it would not make sense in a lot

2992.119 --> 2998.52
of other languages spelling be well we

2995.0 --> 3002.559
have a spell be in the Netherlands oh we

2998.52 --> 3004.599
do and I think other other countries

3002.559 --> 3007.76
have it too by the way I mean all the

3004.599 --> 3007.76
countries have their language

3009.68 --> 3018.68
nerds good long 80 hours terret what the

3015.16 --> 3020.48
[ __ ] there's no way I'd ever last 18

3018.68 --> 3023.96
hours

3020.48 --> 3027.839
dude holy

3023.96 --> 3030.799
[ __ ] it's making me just tired just
