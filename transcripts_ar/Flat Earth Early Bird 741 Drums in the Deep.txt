in order or anything

139.92 --> 146.48
i've just been doing fine but yeah since

i got sick and then underwent the

146.48 --> 151.599
radical arwenian transformation so much

149.36 --> 153.68

151.599 --> 154.879

175.28 --> 179.599
and clear up some things but yeah i

177.92 --> 181.51899999999998
forgot that appointment so i had to

179.599 --> 184.39999999999998
basically

181.519 --> 186.159
cram that all in half an hour up until

184.4 --> 188.64000000000001
one o'clock

186.159 --> 189.28

293.199 --> 297.6
doing great these days

294.84 --> 299.35999999999996
like it's weird i don't watch my shows

297.6 --> 300.47900000000004
back though because freaking two hours

299.36 --> 302.24
man

300.479 --> 304.24
but i'm glad that other people still

302.24 --> 306.32
think it's worth it like even if they're

304.24 --> 307.68
not live there to just watch the show

306.32 --> 309.36
for two hours

307.68 --> 311.919
and i'm getting a lot of comments these

309.36 --> 313.039
days from you guys and i do appreciate

311.919 --> 317.12
that

313.039 --> 320.4
because i am like really doing my best

317.12 --> 324.24
not that it's such a strain or anything

320.4 --> 328.0
but yeah i am outputting i am outputting

324.24 --> 331.6
like an mtf

328.0 --> 333.919
and yeah it shows

331.6 --> 335.6
because i got a lot of energy i got a

333.919 --> 337.68
lot of power and a lot of things to

335.6 --> 340.8
share with the world

337.68 --> 342.16
and i'm not holding back like not like

340.8 --> 344.40000000000003
before

342.16 --> 345.52000000000004
it's like i'm not trying to be sensitive

344.4 --> 347.75899999999996
feely anymore

345.52 --> 349.19899999999996
at all like i've completely given that

347.759 --> 352.40000000000003
up

349.199 --> 354.24
and as a consequence yeah there's just a

352.4 --> 355.75899999999996
lot of intense things that i put out

354.24 --> 360.16
here

355.759 --> 363.44
and when it's called for yeah even like

360.16 --> 364.88000000000005
pretty harsh judgments and all that

363.44 --> 366.96
because that's the way i am that's

364.88 --> 370.56
always been the way i am

366.96 --> 374.4
and i've decided to finally just do that

370.56 --> 377.36
honestly and i guess

374.4 --> 379.19899999999996
it's being received well on average okay

377.36 --> 381.039
look the trolls and the squirters will

379.199 --> 382.16
always be trolls and squirters no matter

381.039 --> 384.479
what

382.16 --> 385.91900000000004
if even if i'm holding back right they

384.479 --> 387.12
always were that they've been doing that

385.919 --> 390.0
from the start

387.12 --> 390.88

because i don't need to wake up to be

that my body kind of does need it's time

500.479 --> 503.52
although i don't fully remember but i'll

502.56 --> 508.08
hear it back

503.52 --> 508.08
there's a good show uh

508.8 --> 512.719
right and then somewhere in the

510.8 --> 515.039
afternoon a little late

512.719 --> 516.24
well it's not late really but oh when

515.039 --> 519.039
benjamin was live

516.24 --> 521.279
and it was like really interesting today

519.039 --> 525.04
or yesterday

521.279 --> 528.32
talking about like just getting on

525.04 --> 531.12
uh on the squirters nerves again

528.32 --> 532.72
by basic yeah on a certain category of

531.12 --> 535.2
squirters

532.72 --> 537.44
right getting on their nerves again for

535.2 --> 538.88
the fun of it to [ __ ] with them and i

537.44 --> 541.0400000000001
love that [ __ ]

538.88 --> 542.88
by basically suggesting like yeah yeah

541.04 --> 543.92
sharia law yeah what's what's really

542.88 --> 546.24
that bad about it

543.92 --> 549.519
hahaha squirters oh wait you can't

546.24 --> 552.88
squirt anymore then oh

549.519 --> 554.88
poor you now you're actually going to

552.88 --> 556.88
have to take the natural strain that

554.88 --> 558.8
comes with not squirting and take

556.88 --> 560.56
freaking responsibility for your life

558.8 --> 562.56
now oh

560.56 --> 563.8389999999999
right and then he called for okay what

562.56 --> 565.4399999999999
is the

563.839 --> 569.12
what's going to be the name because like

565.44 --> 569.12
sharia law is like off

569.36 --> 573.04
of the muslims so yeah what do

572.08 --> 575.76
christians

573.04 --> 577.68
you know like we used to have some

575.76 --> 580.3199999999999
something like that

577.68 --> 581.5999999999999
although that's kind of behind us a long

580.32 --> 583.44
time ago

581.6 --> 585.76
and now it's like all personal and take

583.44 --> 586.8800000000001
your test and it's all super super super

585.76 --> 588.72
tall it's it's been

586.88 --> 590.0
super christianity has been super

588.72 --> 593.6800000000001
tolerant for a very

590.0 --> 594.48
long time very long time but that super

593.68 --> 598.64
tolerance

594.48 --> 602.839
that like in a law sense tolerance

598.64 --> 605.92
like it would always be reser

602.839 --> 608.0
reverse reverted the responsibility

605.92 --> 609.4399999999999
would be reverted to the individual to

608.0 --> 612.959
basically

609.44 --> 615.2
stand the test of seductions

612.959 --> 616.959
because they're they're yeah

615.2 --> 618.24
christianity never really had like this

616.959 --> 620.4799999999999
law like no you're

618.24 --> 621.36
you're just just not allowed to do that

620.48 --> 624.48
or there will be

621.36 --> 627.839
severe punishment that [ __ ]

624.48 --> 630.64
has been kind of like yeah

627.839 --> 631.6800000000001
it's gone for a long time like a long

630.64 --> 635.1999999999999
long time that's

631.68 --> 637.279
that thing that way of doing that has

635.2 --> 639.12
been gone for a long time in like the

637.279 --> 641.4399999999999
entire christian world

639.12 --> 642.9590000000001
for a long time it used to be there

641.44 --> 645.2
though or maybe that's even like

642.959 --> 648.8
pre-christian it's tough to tell

645.2 --> 650.5600000000001
but yeah there are things to say for it

648.8 --> 653.04
even though it's yeah it's rough and

650.56 --> 656.4799999999999
there's going to be a lot of people like

653.04 --> 658.3199999999999
really crying their eyes out over the

656.48 --> 660.72
idea that that might happen

658.32 --> 662.6400000000001
because they need to squirt they're

660.72 --> 664.9590000000001
addicted to squirting

662.64 --> 666.72
and that's not allowed anymore then in

664.959 --> 669.68
that and that's really the reason why

666.72 --> 669.6800000000001
it's like oh my god

669.76 --> 674.72
but we need to we need to squirt and

672.72 --> 678.0790000000001
there are pornos and

674.72 --> 680.8000000000001
and what about freedom freedom to act

678.079 --> 681.76
and degenerate yourself like complete

680.8 --> 685.5999999999999
sick

681.76 --> 688.56
hell demons where yeah that's

685.6 --> 690.72
gonna be gone then why we freedom we

688.56 --> 691.5189999999999
want freedom to be disgusting [ __ ]

690.72 --> 694.24
demons

691.519 --> 695.36
so important to us because that's a

694.24 --> 698.399
christian

695.36 --> 700.0790000000001
yeah right no it's not it's disgusting

698.399 --> 705.12
and it's demonic

700.079 --> 705.12
right so i basically devised a name

705.279 --> 710.079
a name for it an alternative name and it

708.399 --> 710.959
kind of started out as a joke but not

710.079 --> 713.04
really a joke

710.959 --> 714.8
and that's like okay so if the muslims

713.04 --> 720.399
have sharia law

714.8 --> 724.079
how about christians have maria law

720.399 --> 727.839
how about that yeah doesn't that just

724.079 --> 732.8
hit a magical tone it's very christian

727.839 --> 735.7600000000001
and maria is like the the overlooked

732.8 --> 737.519
thing in christianity now there are

735.76 --> 740.959
maria worshippers even

737.519 --> 744.24
but why not call it maria law it's

740.959 --> 747.3599999999999
actually a beautiful name it could be

744.24 --> 748.0
a even a an improved version of sharia

747.36 --> 751.6
law less

748.0 --> 753.36
brutal because it can be pretty brutal

751.6 --> 755.519
like especially if there's like these

753.36 --> 758.16
guys in charge that will just literally

755.519 --> 758.639
just give bad death penalties because

758.16 --> 760.7199999999999
that's

758.639 --> 762.32
that's kind of like a little far i agree

760.72 --> 766.72
with that but

762.32 --> 770.1600000000001
then again yeah the benefits of

766.72 --> 773.36
extreme punishments are palpable

770.16 --> 776.48
as well that's it

773.36 --> 779.12
that's that's really it right

776.48 --> 780.9590000000001
so i thought of yeah maria law why not

779.12 --> 784.639
why not why not devise

780.959 --> 784.6389999999999
write down a maria law

785.279 --> 788.88
and then figure this out so that there

788.16 --> 792.639
at least

788.88 --> 795.6
is an alternative and maybe

792.639 --> 796.5600000000001
maybe if we got one if we got a maria

795.6 --> 800.0
law if it's just

796.56 --> 802.88
as an idea if we got it well maybe then

800.0 --> 805.519
certain groups of muslims might actually

802.88 --> 808.399
think like hey

805.519 --> 809.68
maybe that is actually kind of better

808.399 --> 812.88
maybe we should

809.68 --> 815.04
go there since hey it's our freaking

812.88 --> 819.68
countries here it's ours

815.04 --> 822.0
our blood heritage yeah not yours

819.68 --> 823.04
right you have your own freaking country

822.0 --> 825.36
origins

823.04 --> 827.199
if you want sharia law there that's fine

825.36 --> 830.399
it's your business

827.199 --> 831.68
right and in our country we don't really

830.399 --> 835.6
like that

831.68 --> 839.279
we want our own type of thing so why not

835.6 --> 842.48
devise something like maria law

839.279 --> 843.4399999999999
it's just an idea it is also a bit of a

842.48 --> 846.16
joke

843.44 --> 847.7600000000001
but maybe it doesn't have to be a joke

846.16 --> 850.8
at some point anymore because

847.76 --> 853.4399999999999
people will actually be ready for it

850.8 --> 854.16
so it's an idea an idea for potentially

853.44 --> 857.6800000000001
the future

854.16 --> 861.36
maria law think about it

857.68 --> 865.68
like how could maria law even be dark

861.36 --> 868.399
you know when it's maria it's like

865.68 --> 869.5999999999999
come on maria is like the symbol of

868.399 --> 873.12
virtue

869.6 --> 875.9200000000001
itself of like c c y

873.12 --> 878.16
see it doesn't have to be dark it could

875.92 --> 880.959
be very good

878.16 --> 882.48
eventually so it's just an idea the

880.959 --> 884.6389999999999
maria law

882.48 --> 885.76
right also yeah continuing with some

884.639 --> 888.9590000000001
jokes

885.76 --> 892.03
with that right so there was a lot of

888.959 --> 893.92
talk among bears about roof parties

892.03 --> 896.16
[Music]

893.92 --> 898.16
which which is a very dark joke in a way

896.16 --> 901.4399999999999
because it refers to a certain

898.16 --> 903.519
habit of like throwing well

901.44 --> 904.72
proclaimed gay people of buildings and

903.519 --> 907.36
[ __ ]

904.72 --> 909.9200000000001
so it's like have a roof party here for

907.36 --> 913.1990000000001
roof party

909.92 --> 913.92
so i made just this one joke at the end

913.199 --> 915.519
of it i

913.92 --> 918.88
nobody really picked up on it but it's

915.519 --> 920.519
like okay it's a roof party over at big

918.88 --> 923.76
bears

920.519 --> 926.5600000000001
rollerbladers are welcome but at their

923.76 --> 930.0
own risk

926.56 --> 932.7199999999999
you see how that works because

930.0 --> 934.399
you can take that literal or you can

932.72 --> 937.519
take it metaphorical and

934.399 --> 939.519
both works out because yeah

937.519 --> 941.279
are you literally gonna have a roof

939.519 --> 944.0
party

941.279 --> 945.6
and then on rollerblades because that's

944.0 --> 946.88
pretty [ __ ] dangerous you could

945.6 --> 948.88
literally just

946.88 --> 950.639
get a nudge not be able to break and

948.88 --> 953.759
then literally tumble off the roof

950.639 --> 956.0
because you're on rollerblades right

953.759 --> 957.12
that's very dangerous like and so yeah

956.0 --> 959.519
roof party

957.12 --> 962.079
you are allowed with your roller blades

959.519 --> 965.44
which is also kind of a metaphor

962.079 --> 968.88
right for a certain sexual

965.44 --> 970.32
preference category so like you are

968.88 --> 973.759
allowed there

970.32 --> 975.0400000000001
but at your own risk see i love it i

973.759 --> 978.16
love it it's a harsh

975.04 --> 978.16
but funny joke

978.32 --> 983.1990000000001
roof party over at big bears roller

981.68 --> 986.88
blades are allowed

983.199 --> 989.12
but enter at their own risk love it

986.88 --> 990.88
and i made that i made that joke me

989.12 --> 996.0
arwen i made it i

990.88 --> 1000.32
wrote that joke it's my joke i wrote it

996.0 --> 1000.32
i came up with that that's right me

1000.8 --> 1004.079
inspired by big bear

1006.639 --> 1012.88
so yeah you might be thinking it's funny

1010.959 --> 1015.04
or you think it's disgusting

1012.88 --> 1016.88
i don't really care because i think it's

1015.04 --> 1017.5999999999999
[ __ ] funny and if you can't handle it

1016.88 --> 1019.92
then well

1017.6 --> 1021.6800000000001
i don't know go squirt in a corner

1019.92 --> 1024.1299999999999
somewhere or something

1021.68 --> 1025.4389999999999
and yeah can't really help you

1024.13 --> 1028.3190000000002
[Music]

1025.439 --> 1029.1200000000001
anyway that happened was pretty intense

1028.319 --> 1032.24
show

1029.12 --> 1035.4389999999999
very funny and uh

1032.24 --> 1037.679
after that i went on to go to martin

1035.439 --> 1040.799
luther's hangout

1037.679 --> 1043.76
and this time because it was very it was

1040.799 --> 1045.039
very unique he played a silent movie i

1043.76 --> 1047.76
don't remember the name

1045.039 --> 1049.6
it was a silent movie basically about

1047.76 --> 1051.84
the civil war

1049.6 --> 1055.6789999999999
sort of civil war situation and it was

1051.84 --> 1059.76
constantly with trains and soldiers and

1055.679 --> 1062.4
a lot of stunts in there was fascinating

1059.76 --> 1064.08
fascinating to see that one fascinating

1062.4 --> 1067.52
i've never seen that video

1064.08 --> 1068.24
before but it was really good like oh my

1067.52 --> 1070.799
god

1068.24 --> 1072.64
so that was like a really exciting movie

1070.799 --> 1076.0
and there was no

1072.64 --> 1078.64
no sound other than music played over it

1076.0 --> 1079.36
and it was all just visual real stunts

1078.64 --> 1082.7990000000002
and like some

1079.36 --> 1084.6399999999999
really risky freaky stunts dude like

1082.799 --> 1088.16
that they were doing like forward jokes

1084.64 --> 1091.76
sitting like on the side of the wheel

1088.16 --> 1094.72
and it's like dude like one wrong move

1091.76 --> 1096.32
and he's absolutely like cut in two

1094.72 --> 1099.039
pieces

1096.32 --> 1099.52
that was so dangerous and just for a

1099.039 --> 1101.36
joke

1099.52 --> 1103.12
you know they just did that in the movie

1101.36 --> 1108.08
and another time like

1103.12 --> 1111.6
he just like climbed off a hill

1108.08 --> 1113.76
literally climbing off a hill

1111.6 --> 1115.4399999999998
and you could see like holy [ __ ] dude

1113.76 --> 1116.559
like one wrong move and he would have

1115.44 --> 1119.1200000000001
broken his freaking

1116.559 --> 1121.6789999999999
neck just falling down on the on the

1119.12 --> 1124.0
rocks that was super dangerous

1121.679 --> 1125.2800000000002
and other stumps where we're literally

1124.0 --> 1127.28
like a train and

1125.28 --> 1129.52
there's no props in these things right

1127.28 --> 1131.44
it's all on location all real every

1129.52 --> 1134.559
stunt is real there's no cgi

1131.44 --> 1137.76
nothing that they would like put

1134.559 --> 1140.24
a wooden block right in the rails and as

1137.76 --> 1143.28
the guy would approach with the train

1140.24 --> 1146.0
like quickly quickly just

1143.28 --> 1146.96
get it out there if he'd failed in that

1146.0 --> 1149.28
stunt

1146.96 --> 1150.0
then the entire train would have crashed

1149.28 --> 1151.36
right on top

1150.0 --> 1153.52
of it and he would have been crushed

1151.36 --> 1156.799
that was madness

1153.52 --> 1158.559
the risk these actors were taking

1156.799 --> 1160.799
in the early days with these silent

1158.559 --> 1163.84
movies are just astounding

1160.799 --> 1165.52
astounding risk and it's just like whoa

1163.84 --> 1167.9189999999999
these guys man

1165.52 --> 1169.039
these guys had some balls making these

1167.919 --> 1171.76
movies

1169.039 --> 1172.48
you might think oh silly silly old movie

1171.76 --> 1174.72
right

1172.48 --> 1176.799
well i watched it from beginning to end

1174.72 --> 1179.3600000000001
because martin played the whole thing

1176.799 --> 1181.76
that was really impressive it's like

1179.36 --> 1182.24
dude that's like the mission impossible

1181.76 --> 1185.52
of the

1182.24 --> 1187.6
of the 1930s or something like really it

1185.52 --> 1188.4
was like a mission impossible movie but

1187.6 --> 1193.28
silent

1188.4 --> 1194.96
it's incredible incredible

1193.28 --> 1196.48
so yeah check it out it was on martin

1194.96 --> 1198.799
luther's channel

1196.48 --> 1199.84
martin litka has all kinds of things

1198.799 --> 1203.2
that he does

1199.84 --> 1207.6789999999999
usually a lot of likes just pictures and

1203.2 --> 1209.3600000000001
design pictures and stuff

1207.679 --> 1211.6000000000001
yeah my thoughts is like why don't you

1209.36 --> 1220.0
leave me alone

1211.6 --> 1223.12
go away

1220.0 --> 1226.72
i don't want to [ __ ]

1223.12 --> 1227.9189999999999
talk about freaks and their [ __ ]

1226.72 --> 1231.44
opinions

1227.919 --> 1232.159
when they stalk other chats to make

1231.44 --> 1234.48
people

1232.159 --> 1235.2800000000002
miserable i don't want to talk about

1234.48 --> 1237.44
them

1235.28 --> 1239.76
i don't want anything to do about them

1237.44 --> 1239.76
okay

1240.32 --> 1245.84
all right uh

1243.84 --> 1249.039
right so that silent movie was pretty

1245.84 --> 1252.1589999999999
damn impressive and then

1249.039 --> 1254.48
after that i yeah finally i got to it i

1252.159 --> 1258.24
started to watch excalibur

1254.48 --> 1259.96

you you think game of thrones is kind of

1333.36 --> 1338.24
cool

yeah well guess what this [ __ ] movie

1338.24 --> 1345.84

1341.919 --> 1346.5590000000002
and they don't just do shock and disgust

1354.72 --> 1360.08
point and there's blood

1360.08 --> 1367.76
giant rembrandt medieval renaissance

1399.679 --> 1403.1200000000001
movie that exists

1401.28 --> 1404.96
that's like the impression that i get

1403.12 --> 1407.6789999999999
like everything else is just a cheap

1404.96 --> 1411.52
imitation

1407.679 --> 1415.3600000000001
it's an incredible movie and so real

1411.52 --> 1416.4
so raw so rough like really freaking

1415.36 --> 1419.28
medieval like

1416.4 --> 1420.24
oh oh we we gotta be we gotta tone it

1419.28 --> 1423.279

my women might get offended or something

1426.32 --> 1430.0

that it was like this

1479.76 --> 1483.2
what movie is this again why don't you

1481.2 --> 1487.8400000000001
freaking pay attention instead of

1483.2 --> 1487.8400000000001
nagging my chat akuma virus

1488.72 --> 1492.64
talking about excalibur

1495.039 --> 1499.6
a movie that i had never seen before and

1497.2 --> 1501.1200000000001
i'm absolutely astounded that i've never

1499.6 --> 1505.12
seen it before

1501.12 --> 1506.3999999999999
because this movie i'd almost say it is

1505.12 --> 1509.52
the

1506.4 --> 1511.679
it is like the example of baldur's gate

1509.52 --> 1512.96
of the atmosphere in baldur's gate the

1511.679 --> 1516.159
raw

1512.96 --> 1518.32
the rawness of it straightforward

1516.159 --> 1520.0
the courage and just the spirit of the

1518.32 --> 1524.72
people in this movie is

1520.0 --> 1528.32
is unparalleled like they're all like

1524.72 --> 1530.159
but not fake not acty it's oh they're

1528.32 --> 1533.52
all like these characters and they're

1530.159 --> 1536.96
all like seething with energy seething

1533.52 --> 1540.32
like on fire with will and passion and

1536.96 --> 1540.72
energy and like they literally just

1540.32 --> 1543.36
would

1540.72 --> 1544.64
like literally kill somebody on the spot

1543.36 --> 1547.039
if they would

1544.64 --> 1549.3600000000001
like dishonor them and something like

1547.039 --> 1552.1589999999999
that almost happens

1549.36 --> 1556.32
right and it's like absolutely

1552.159 --> 1560.48
convincing it's like so convincing that

1556.32 --> 1564.0
just unbelievable in 1981 guys 81

1560.48 --> 1565.84
this movie is 39 years old i can't

1564.0 --> 1569.12
believe my eyes

1565.84 --> 1569.12
i can't believe it

1569.36 --> 1577.36

1633.76 --> 1637.919
disgusting

1634.799 --> 1639.44

from the society

1639.44 --> 1644.24
from our our endeavor

1645.2 --> 1648.32
and i don't know how i just know that i

1647.84 --> 1650.48

1654.48 --> 1658.24
what a cave troll

1658.559 --> 1665.279
absolutely repulsive yeah and by the way

1662.72 --> 1665.919
that also counts for another individual

1665.279 --> 1670.799
that you've

1665.919 --> 1674.3200000000002
all known and maybe appreciate it or not

1670.799 --> 1678.32
but yeah good servant is never

welcome here ever again ever

1678.32 --> 1682.399
i banned him i blocked him i never want

1681.44 --> 1686.24
to freaking

1682.399 --> 1689.36
see or hear from him ever again

1686.24 --> 1692.32
he's [ __ ] and he can never be

1689.36 --> 1692.32
unfucked

1692.64 --> 1698.24
and i've shared with some people why

1696.32 --> 1700.1589999999999
i don't really care to elaborate about

1698.24 --> 1703.52
it because i'm like really hurt

1700.159 --> 1705.1200000000001
it's literally like i just like one of

1703.52 --> 1707.679
my jedi trainees

1705.12 --> 1709.6789999999999
literally just converted to the dark

1707.679 --> 1711.76
side and he doesn't even know it

1709.679 --> 1713.6000000000001
he doesn't even know it that he's

1711.76 --> 1716.32
literally a reversed world

1713.6 --> 1717.9189999999999
everything everything everything is

1716.32 --> 1721.2
reversed world in him now

1717.919 --> 1722.48
and he doesn't even see it still thinks

1721.2 --> 1725.8400000000001
he's doing something right

1722.48 --> 1727.1200000000001
it's so unbelievably disgusting i have

1725.84 --> 1730.48
no words to describe

1727.12 --> 1739.84
how repulsed i am

1730.48 --> 1739.84
no words

1743.6 --> 1752.0
ah right well chandler bing that's

1747.12 --> 1754.9599999999998
cute i appreciate

1752.0 --> 1755.84
that you're not here just to troll me

1754.96 --> 1757.679
because i do

1755.84 --> 1759.039
look there's going to be people okay

1757.679 --> 1760.96
there's going to be people with sock

1759.039 --> 1764.0
accounts all over the place

1760.96 --> 1766.88
right because i have enemies now

1764.0 --> 1768.64
or rather they have declared me their

1766.88 --> 1770.88
enemy and they're gonna come in from

1768.64 --> 1774.159
several angles from

1770.88 --> 1776.3200000000002
like yeah flat earthers

1774.159 --> 1779.919
not not ballers like the ballers seem to

1776.32 --> 1782.1589999999999
have kind of made peace with me i guess

1779.919 --> 1784.159
because i think that they now think oh

1782.159 --> 1784.5590000000002
wait well he's attacking flat earth or

1784.159 --> 1787.8400000000001
so

1784.559 --> 1790.24
why bother you know straight

1787.84 --> 1792.08
strategy let let the enemy destroy each

1790.24 --> 1794.799
other yeah yeah it's very cute

1792.08 --> 1795.76
yeah just a reminder though for the

1794.799 --> 1798.96
ballers

1795.76 --> 1800.1589999999999
you are defeated absolutely utterly

1798.96 --> 1802.0
defeated

1800.159 --> 1803.3600000000001
and that's never going to change in all

1802.0 --> 1807.279
this stupid

1803.36 --> 1810.399
infighting and routing of psychopaths

1807.279 --> 1811.279
amidst ourselves amidst our circles will

1810.399 --> 1814.08
not detract

1811.279 --> 1815.52
that you are utterly defeated so yeah

1814.08 --> 1818.32
stand by that's fine

1815.52 --> 1819.76
i don't care and at the same time

1818.32 --> 1822.24
there's people

1819.76 --> 1822.8799999999999
that are now in in it for me and they

1822.24 --> 1826.159
are

1822.88 --> 1829.0390000000002
just like really trying to [ __ ] around

1826.159 --> 1830.88
and just see if they can make me squirt

1829.039 --> 1833.36
or get really pissed off or

1830.88 --> 1834.159
overstep some kind of boundary or maybe

1833.36 --> 1837.1999999999998
they probably

1834.159 --> 1840.96
imagine how they

1837.2 --> 1841.279
can unravel some kind of secret because

1840.96 --> 1844.24
i

1841.279 --> 1844.64
am our win right and i must be hiding

1844.24 --> 1848.08
some

1844.64 --> 1850.5590000000002
really dark [ __ ] in my past i must be

1848.08 --> 1851.279
they're obsessed they they re they wants

1850.559 --> 1853.9189999999999
it

1851.279 --> 1854.64
they want that weakness they wants it

1853.919 --> 1857.679
from me

1854.64 --> 1861.679
because i burn this them

1857.679 --> 1865.039
i burns is them with a light with a pure

1861.679 --> 1868.159
pure merciless light and it hurts

1865.039 --> 1870.399
it hurts us i know it does

1868.159 --> 1871.7600000000002
so they are obsessed with finding some

1870.399 --> 1874.799
darkness [ __ ]

1871.76 --> 1879.12
in there and

1874.799 --> 1882.08
yeah and good servant is with them

1879.12 --> 1883.4399999999998
so i don't trust him anymore i've

1882.08 --> 1886.48
removed him everywhere

1883.44 --> 1889.1200000000001
i think he's literally spying

1886.48 --> 1890.0
i've told him things in very careful

1889.12 --> 1892.559
confidence

1890.0 --> 1894.72
like really deep feeling things like my

1892.559 --> 1896.399
own personal nightmares and illusions i

1894.72 --> 1900.08
share details with him

1896.399 --> 1901.279
and he's betrayed me he's betrayed me

1900.08 --> 1902.6399999999999
i don't know what he's gonna do with

1901.279 --> 1903.84
that i don't know if he's gonna talk

1902.64 --> 1906.0800000000002
about it or not or

1903.84 --> 1908.559
keep it a secret forever but the fact

1906.08 --> 1910.72
that he's just stepped away like this

1908.559 --> 1913.279
and said oh if you've done nothing you

1910.72 --> 1917.76
have nothing to worry about

1913.279 --> 1921.039
is is such a betrayal

1917.76 --> 1922.8799999999999
that i don't know man this was an

1921.039 --> 1925.6
army and he would be there i would now

1922.88 --> 1929.7600000000002
execute him for treachery

1925.6 --> 1929.76
right he's lucky it's not an army

1931.6 --> 1937.9189999999999
yeah i know i know i know your eyes on

1935.76 --> 1938.96
fire is very funny to you everything is

1937.919 --> 1941.1200000000001
funny to you yeah

1938.96 --> 1943.3600000000001
that's that's great you know being

1941.12 --> 1945.4399999999998
absolutely lost in lies

1943.36 --> 1947.6789999999999
and having no more argument to stand on

1945.44 --> 1949.279
but your own delusion is very funny

1947.679 --> 1951.519
and that's your way of dealing with that

1949.279 --> 1953.679
akuma virus so that's great

1951.519 --> 1956.159
we don't really care though we don't

1953.679 --> 1957.519
care that you think it's funny

1956.159 --> 1959.3600000000001
we don't care that you're not taking

1957.519 --> 1962.3990000000001
anything serious because

1959.36 --> 1963.6789999999999
you are utterly defeated without

1962.399 --> 1966.7199999999998
recourse

1963.679 --> 1969.519
and making fun of that utter defeat

1966.72 --> 1970.559
is all you got left and that's fine you

1969.519 --> 1972.3990000000001
do that

1970.559 --> 1973.84
it doesn't change anything though and

1972.399 --> 1977.84
you're not fooling anyone

1973.84 --> 1977.84
except yourself just so you know

1980.0 --> 1982.32
right

1984.799 --> 1991.9189999999999
right anyway chanter bing

1988.08 --> 1993.12
is that really your name or is this some

1991.919 --> 1995.1200000000001
kind of weird

1993.12 --> 1997.4399999999998
in-between thing that you created i

1995.12 --> 1997.4399999999998
don't know

2000.159 --> 2004.25
yeah akuma virus we don't really care

2002.84 --> 2007.4599999999998
though

2004.25 --> 2007.46
[Music]

2016.84 --> 2019.84
right

2019.919 --> 2023.8400000000001
good sense of humor well this is only

2023.039 --> 2026.799
survival

2023.84 --> 2029.1999999999998
mechanism you know because otherwise it

2026.799 --> 2035.2
just be steamrolled every single time

2029.2 --> 2035.2
so is his ability to make fun of it all

2035.6 --> 2042.32
you know this is an army metaphorically

2038.96 --> 2045.519
yes robin stanley it is

2042.32 --> 2047.84
but that sense i can only execute people

2045.519 --> 2048.56
for treachery metaphorically by just

2047.84 --> 2052.3199999999997
banning

2048.56 --> 2054.56
them entirely and marking them as

2052.32 --> 2056.8
this is a traitor and that's what i've

2054.56 --> 2056.7999999999997
done

2059.599 --> 2062.7200000000003
can't take everything too serious in

2061.359 --> 2065.5989999999997
life

2062.72 --> 2067.839
uh life is about being happy no no it's

2065.599 --> 2067.839
not

2069.56 --> 2072.679
[Music]

2072.839 --> 2075.839
no

2075.87 --> 2079.839
[Music]

2077.919 --> 2081.2
but that's fine you can believe that it

2079.839 --> 2082.96
is it's not

2081.2 --> 2084.56
though because it's going to lead to it

2082.96 --> 2086.159
and then every single time

2084.56 --> 2087.7599999999998
you're not going to progress if that is

2086.159 --> 2092.32
your objection

2087.76 --> 2092.32
or yeah your objective i mean right

2094.879 --> 2097.5989999999997
chandler bing

2100.8 --> 2104.2400000000002
see that sometimes when you're on fvd

2102.72 --> 2105.5989999999997
and people don't let you discuss your

2104.24 --> 2108.3999999999996
ideas

2105.599 --> 2109.3590000000004
threaten my id what what do you mean i i

2108.4 --> 2110.56
don't understand

2109.359 --> 2112.96
gentle i don't understand the

2110.56 --> 2116.32
correlation

2112.96 --> 2117.599
my ideas i have spiritual ideas i never

2116.32 --> 2121.119
talk about them on

2117.599 --> 2123.52
fed i only talk about mechanical things

2121.119 --> 2127.359
on fvd like the

2123.52 --> 2130.56
my conception of what light may be

2127.359 --> 2132.3199999999997
you know i have like ideas that step

2130.56 --> 2134.0
away from the original notion of the

2132.32 --> 2138.8
light being a particle

2134.0 --> 2141.2
with a finite quan quanta

2138.8 --> 2143.76
that's the thing that i question kiwi

2141.2 --> 2144.0
will always i suspect be pissed off at

2143.76 --> 2145.76
me

2144.0 --> 2147.52
for that like forever he's never going

2145.76 --> 2148.079
to accept that like the last time i

2147.52 --> 2151.28
brought it up

2148.079 --> 2153.76
again he just got really pissed off so

2151.28 --> 2154.32
he's never going to accept that i will

2153.76 --> 2157.0400000000004
not

2154.32 --> 2159.76
just per default except that light's

2157.04 --> 2161.2799999999997
supposed to be a particle

2159.76 --> 2163.44
and that doesn't mean it's a wave and i

2161.28 --> 2165.119
have to like every time say that no

2163.44 --> 2166.64
light's not a wave light's not a wave i

2165.119 --> 2167.04
have to say it every single time but

2166.64 --> 2170.4
even

2167.04 --> 2171.68
though i do say that qe will always stay

2170.4 --> 2174.4
pissed off

2171.68 --> 2174.8799999999997
for at me for questioning that it's

2174.4 --> 2177.76
weird

2174.88 --> 2178.96
like how he sort of threatens me like

2177.76 --> 2181.599
you don't want to go

2178.96 --> 2182.88
there you know it's going to end bad

2181.599 --> 2184.8
like dude what the [ __ ] are you

2182.88 --> 2185.76
blabbering about i'm just questioning

2184.8 --> 2188.48
the nature of

2185.76 --> 2189.8390000000004
reality why is that a threat this

2188.48 --> 2191.92
ridiculous what you're gonna do

2189.839 --> 2192.88
don't strike me the [ __ ] are you

2191.92 --> 2195.44
blabbering about

2192.88 --> 2197.52
stop being a [ __ ] and just let me

2195.44 --> 2200.56
figure out reality

2197.52 --> 2202.079
right but yeah he doesn't want to

2200.56 --> 2203.7599999999998
he just doesn't want to go there so

2202.079 --> 2204.48
whatever then i'll do it on my own i

2203.76 --> 2208.2400000000002
don't need

2204.48 --> 2209.52
qe for my intellectual exploits i don't

2208.24 --> 2211.5989999999997
need him at all

2209.52 --> 2215.839
you know he's taught me a lot it doesn't

2211.599 --> 2215.839
mean i need him for anything so

2220.32 --> 2225.599
qe is just right and stick in his what

2223.44 --> 2227.76
that doesn't make any sense that's not

2225.599 --> 2231.119
correct english

2227.76 --> 2233.0400000000004
do you mean stuck in his ways

2231.119 --> 2234.6400000000003
that that might be he is a stick in the

2233.04 --> 2237.359
mud absolutely

2234.64 --> 2242.96
big freaking stick in the mud absolutely

2237.359 --> 2245.2799999999997
that's what he is

2242.96 --> 2246.8
but yeah he stuck that stick in the mud

2245.28 --> 2249.2000000000003
in the right place

2246.8 --> 2250.079
and it's it's a place where a stick

2249.2 --> 2254.16
needs to be

2250.079 --> 2256.6400000000003
in the mud so that's fine

2254.16 --> 2258.96
don't tell me what i need to do akuma

2256.64 --> 2261.7599999999998
virus i don't need your freaking advice

2258.96 --> 2261.76
on anything

2262.0 --> 2267.76
all right you don't need to tell me

2265.68 --> 2268.96
a single thing of how to deal with

2267.76 --> 2285.8390000000004
anything

2268.96 --> 2285.839
ever okay you understand

2288.4 --> 2294.32
yeah but you don't need to tell me

2291.599 --> 2295.44
don't let him do this or that yeah you

2294.32 --> 2298.2400000000002
don't

2295.44 --> 2299.68
you don't have big brother or father

2298.24 --> 2302.0789999999997
social

2299.68 --> 2303.44
capability towards me i don't allow you

2302.079 --> 2306.7200000000003
to

2303.44 --> 2309.119
because yeah so very cute and nice but

2306.72 --> 2311.359
you are delusional

2309.119 --> 2313.44
and i do not need your advice on

2311.359 --> 2315.2
anything

2313.44 --> 2318.32
i've never asked your advice on anything

2315.2 --> 2320.56
i don't need it on anything

2318.32 --> 2322.4
yeah being human yeah yeah well why

2320.56 --> 2323.359
don't you try being human a little bit

2322.4 --> 2326.1600000000003
more and stop

2323.359 --> 2327.2799999999997
lying to yourself then might we might

2326.16 --> 2329.68
talk at some point

2327.28 --> 2329.6800000000003
all right

2334.56 --> 2342.88
oh did you just tell me to calm down

2340.4 --> 2343.52
yeah that means you just got banned

2342.88 --> 2346.2400000000002
nobody

2343.52 --> 2348.56
[ __ ] tells me to do anything on my

2346.24 --> 2355.839
show especially calming down

2348.56 --> 2355.839
get the [ __ ] out

2361.04 --> 2366.88
right so anyway

2364.24 --> 2368.7999999999997
excalibur it was pretty awesome i have

2366.88 --> 2369.359
not finished it because things kind of

2368.8 --> 2372.7200000000003
like got

2369.359 --> 2375.68
kind of grim in the second half

2372.72 --> 2376.0
it is really the complete story it is

2375.68 --> 2378.16
but

2376.0 --> 2380.64
like it got really grim it got really

2378.16 --> 2384.0789999999997
sad like

2380.64 --> 2387.04
like they have this peak where like

2384.079 --> 2388.6400000000003
the country is united under the king and

2387.04 --> 2391.2
excalibur

2388.64 --> 2392.0
and then eventually everything goes to

2391.2 --> 2395.52
[ __ ]

2392.0 --> 2399.359
big time and like they all just

2395.52 --> 2401.68
basically he goes mad

2399.359 --> 2404.24
everybody loses the spirit and they all

2401.68 --> 2406.0
go on a foolish quest and while they're

2404.24 --> 2409.52
all dwelling

2406.0 --> 2412.0
and the unity and the bravery and

2409.52 --> 2414.4
the spirit like the righteousness

2412.0 --> 2415.2
basically drops off it palpably drops

2414.4 --> 2417.76
off this is like

2415.2 --> 2418.64
incredible about the movie is that there

2417.76 --> 2421.6800000000003
is like a

2418.64 --> 2422.72
palpable spirit there's a palpable

2421.68 --> 2425.5989999999997
spirit there

2422.72 --> 2426.0
you can literally point at it like this

2425.599 --> 2428.96
is

2426.0 --> 2430.0
what is going down in this movie this is

2428.96 --> 2431.96
the feeling

2430.0 --> 2434.16
this is how they all feel this is the

2431.96 --> 2435.76
consequences of that this is where they

2434.16 --> 2437.839
get their strength from

2435.76 --> 2440.2400000000002
and then these things happen and

2437.839 --> 2443.52
suddenly everything changes and it

2440.24 --> 2446.4799999999996
really palpably changes

2443.52 --> 2447.52
it palpably changes and everything how

2446.48 --> 2450.8
they respond makes

2447.52 --> 2453.359
perfect sense it's it's

2450.8 --> 2455.92
crazy it's crazy how well it's done

2453.359 --> 2460.4
crazy i've never seen anything like this

2455.92 --> 2460.4
ever never seen a movie like this

2461.839 --> 2466.72
and i've not gone through it entirely

2465.119 --> 2470.96
but like i'm i kind of stuck

2466.72 --> 2473.52
at a point where things got really dark

2470.96 --> 2474.64
like really grim and like the people

2473.52 --> 2477.04
that

2474.64 --> 2478.319
had good left are like taking a pounding

2477.04 --> 2481.7599999999998
and [ __ ]

2478.319 --> 2485.2799999999997
and it's just it's yeah

2481.76 --> 2488.6400000000003
i'm very impressed by it

2485.28 --> 2488.6400000000003
but it's super intense

2492.079 --> 2495.8390000000004
and uh yeah

2496.96 --> 2503.28
that's it for the notes i guess still

2500.16 --> 2503.2799999999997
quite a lot of notes right

2503.52 --> 2509.44
maria law roof party

2506.8 --> 2512.1600000000003
of at big bears rollerbladers allowed

2509.44 --> 2516.0
but enter at your own risk

2512.16 --> 2519.1189999999997
martin luther's awesome silent movie

2516.0 --> 2520.48
and the movie excalibur that i haven't

2519.119 --> 2523.119
fully watched through

2520.48 --> 2524.59
it's like yeah that's been my day and a

2523.119 --> 2526.319
bunch of games on the side

2524.59 --> 2528.079
[Applause]

2526.319 --> 2530.0
i yeah yeah by the way i continued

2528.079 --> 2532.5600000000004
playing uh

2530.0 --> 2533.68
baldur's gate 3 i've got to some new

2532.56 --> 2537.359
stages and it's

2533.68 --> 2539.1189999999997
it's pretty good it's not it's very

2537.359 --> 2540.64
different though from the original

2539.119 --> 2544.1600000000003
baldur's gate

2540.64 --> 2546.48
it's very different so

2544.16 --> 2549.1189999999997
i don't know exactly what to think of

2546.48 --> 2551.52
the whole thing just yet

2549.119 --> 2552.4
i think that it the whole game really

2551.52 --> 2555.92
does require

2552.4 --> 2558.56
a lot of tinkering a lot it really

2555.92 --> 2558.56
needs to be

2559.52 --> 2564.4
fine-tuned and adapted potentially

2562.56 --> 2566.48
bigger changes

2564.4 --> 2569.04
like the whole mechanics is it it

2566.48 --> 2570.8
doesn't feel exactly right yet

2569.04 --> 2572.079
so there's there's going to be a lot of

2570.8 --> 2573.76
changes but

2572.079 --> 2576.079
here's the fascinating thing they got a

2573.76 --> 2579.8390000000004
couple of really interesting functions

2576.079 --> 2583.04
like really interesting they now have

2579.839 --> 2586.16
like physical interaction mechanics

2583.04 --> 2586.72
like dnd like baldur's gate was just a

2586.16 --> 2589.359
2d

2586.72 --> 2589.7599999999998
board with like this is where you can't

2589.359 --> 2591.839
walk

2589.76 --> 2593.5200000000004
that is where you can walk and it's just

2591.839 --> 2596.0
like you move

2593.52 --> 2597.68
the characters over what is technically

2596.0 --> 2601.44
a flat board

2597.68 --> 2602.0789999999997
with visually impr like oh this is high

2601.44 --> 2605.2000000000003
because it's

2602.079 --> 2606.88
drawn to be high in the game it's not

2605.2 --> 2609.839
actually higher it's just

2606.88 --> 2610.2400000000002
a drawing and it's like oh this part

2609.839 --> 2612.56
just

2610.24 --> 2614.9599999999996
seems like it's really on top of a tower

2612.56 --> 2617.52
when it's just a flat thing

2614.96 --> 2619.04
well in this game it's really 3d and

2617.52 --> 2620.0
they got some really fascinating

2619.04 --> 2623.04
mechanics in there

2620.0 --> 2626.319
like a standard function to jump

2623.04 --> 2628.24
you can actually jump over things holy

2626.319 --> 2631.04
[ __ ] that's the first time

2628.24 --> 2632.8799999999997
and like shove people you can push

2631.04 --> 2635.7599999999998
somebody

2632.88 --> 2636.88
off a ledge an enemy that's like the

2635.76 --> 2639.44
first time that

2636.88 --> 2641.6800000000003
like that that i've seen such mechanisms

2639.44 --> 2641.68
in

2641.76 --> 2647.3590000000004
in a dnd game and i'm really really

2644.96 --> 2649.68
fascinated by it they got like

2647.359 --> 2650.48
physical interaction mechanics it's like

2649.68 --> 2654.24
wow

2650.48 --> 2657.839
awesome that's at least a good start

2654.24 --> 2660.8799999999997
and it worked pretty decently it's like

2657.839 --> 2664.0
those were the things that i in

2660.88 --> 2665.04
my vision of a next level dnd game that

2664.0 --> 2668.319
i wanted in

2665.04 --> 2672.079
it and they have it it's like wow

2668.319 --> 2677.359
they they got they got it they got that

2672.079 --> 2680.2400000000002
that's really interesting it really is

2677.359 --> 2682.7999999999997
so yeah there is some really promising

2680.24 --> 2685.9199999999996
things in the mechanics of the game

2682.8 --> 2688.48
it was a little slow though and some

2685.92 --> 2691.359
graphic issues but yeah it's still the

2688.48 --> 2693.92
startup phase but it was very

2691.359 --> 2693.92
interesting

2694.0 --> 2697.52
so far so i've gotten like out of the

2696.8 --> 2700.4
flying

2697.52 --> 2701.119
like the intro action scene the intro

2700.4 --> 2704.48
first part

2701.119 --> 2707.92
in a flying giant monster ship

2704.48 --> 2710.2400000000002
literally like a mind flayer giant

2707.92 --> 2711.839
flying ship it's all organic and

2710.24 --> 2713.68
disgusting

2711.839 --> 2715.599
i got through that part where it

2713.68 --> 2716.24
basically crashed and you start on an

2715.599 --> 2718.079
island

2716.24 --> 2720.64
in the second phase now i'm i kind of

2718.079 --> 2720.6400000000003
stopped there

2721.119 --> 2725.6800000000003
you should definitely be a game designer

2723.44 --> 2728.88
right sure

2725.68 --> 2732.16
no not really well maybe

2728.88 --> 2734.079
i could it's just that this this world

2732.16 --> 2735.44
how it works i i don't think they need

2734.079 --> 2741.119
me

2735.44 --> 2747.359
i doubt it but i am like an analyst

2741.119 --> 2750.6400000000003
i am i do analyze games

2747.359 --> 2753.04
but a game designer i don't know

2750.64 --> 2755.44
i put down i like i could me a story

2753.04 --> 2759.44
designer i could definitely

2755.44 --> 2761.359
construct a story or like a backdrop

2759.44 --> 2763.2000000000003
like what is the history what is the

2761.359 --> 2764.96
atmosphere of it all what are

2763.2 --> 2766.72
what is everybody like i think about

2764.96 --> 2768.7200000000003
those types of things

2766.72 --> 2771.52
i can do that that's what i do as a game

2768.72 --> 2774.72
master too in in dnd

2771.52 --> 2778.319
game reviewer no absolutely not

2774.72 --> 2780.9599999999996
that's a waste of time there's there's

2778.319 --> 2782.079
hundreds of thousands of people that

2780.96 --> 2784.56
already do that

2782.079 --> 2787.28
and they've been doing that for a decade

2784.56 --> 2787.2799999999997
so no

2787.359 --> 2792.16
game reviewer no but i will be an

2790.16 --> 2795.7599999999998
analyst

2792.16 --> 2798.0
i can do that and i can give advice

2795.76 --> 2800.1600000000003
like long-term advices like this is a

2798.0 --> 2802.24
good mechanism this is a good system

2800.16 --> 2804.0789999999997
this should be abandoned that should be

2802.24 --> 2806.3999999999996
avoided that's the kind of thing that i

2804.079 --> 2810.0
do i already do it here on the show

2806.4 --> 2810.56
live every time but i'm not going to

2810.0 --> 2812.8
like be

2810.56 --> 2815.119
a professional game reviewer it's an

2812.8 --> 2818.48
absolute waste of my time

2815.119 --> 2818.48
nobody's going to care anyway

2818.88 --> 2825.359
what's your first system commodore 64.

2822.56 --> 2825.359
first computer

2826.8 --> 2835.3590000000004
commodore 64.

2831.44 --> 2835.359
nintendo 8 bit

2836.48 --> 2840.0
amiga 1200

2840.4 --> 2843.44
super nintendo

2843.599 --> 2850.079
and then a pc and then i stuck to the pc

2847.04 --> 2852.88
and that's the order of how i've my

2850.079 --> 2858.079
computer history

2852.88 --> 2860.559
i was always in it for the games always

2858.079 --> 2862.559
and i've designed quite a lot of things

2860.559 --> 2863.76
on my commodore 64. i've kept the

2862.559 --> 2866.96
commodore 64

2863.76 --> 2869.2000000000003
throughout it's just that oh the

2866.96 --> 2871.44
the appealingness of the nintendo and

2869.2 --> 2873.4399999999996
all that it really caught my heart

2871.44 --> 2874.7200000000003
early on is like with this new game

2873.44 --> 2877.2000000000003
thing

2874.72 --> 2878.64
but the commodore 64 was always just

2877.2 --> 2882.3999999999996
amazing

2878.64 --> 2886.319
amazing like i had thousands

2882.4 --> 2888.7200000000003
of games on my commodore 64. thousands

2886.319 --> 2890.319
thousands can you imagine thousands of

2888.72 --> 2893.5989999999997
games

2890.319 --> 2898.0
it's crazy it's like

2893.599 --> 2900.2400000000002
you you you can like now

2898.0 --> 2901.2
like i've i've had times where i would

2900.24 --> 2903.2
literally just

2901.2 --> 2904.96
put all the freaking discs all the

2903.2 --> 2908.0789999999997
floppy disks in like

2904.96 --> 2908.64
eight buckets of floppy disks and i

2908.079 --> 2912.1600000000003
would be like

2908.64 --> 2914.72
okay i'm going to go through this

2912.16 --> 2916.319
disk by disk because i just didn't even

2914.72 --> 2918.48
know what was on everything

2916.319 --> 2921.68
it wasn't even catalogued it was that

2918.48 --> 2925.359
much and then i spent like half a year

2921.68 --> 2928.319
playing every game that i could find one

2925.359 --> 2930.96
by one just to catalog it

2928.319 --> 2932.72
guess what after a few months i gave up

2930.96 --> 2934.48
it was too much

2932.72 --> 2936.8799999999997
i just i just didn't want to do it

2934.48 --> 2938.2400000000002
anymore i was sick of it i didn't want

2936.88 --> 2942.0
to do it anymore

2938.24 --> 2944.0789999999997
it's too much too many games and that's

2942.0 --> 2946.58
a commodore 64.

2944.079 --> 2947.8390000000004
crazy times

2946.58 --> 2950.16
[Music]

2947.839 --> 2950.16
right

2952.24 --> 2960.16
the that's an art director is it

2956.8 --> 2963.44
alright well that sounds exactly

2960.16 --> 2966.0789999999997
what i would do an art director that's

2963.44 --> 2966.079
fascinating

2969.119 --> 2973.359
right well look i think that if i'm ever

2972.48 --> 2976.72
going to do

2973.359 --> 2980.0
anything like this like in gaming

2976.72 --> 2982.0
i will be like a somebody stooge

2980.0 --> 2985.359
so somebody would have to actually

2982.0 --> 2987.359
believe in my qualities

2985.359 --> 2988.5589999999997
because i can't offer myself

2987.359 --> 2990.96
professionally i don't

2988.559 --> 2992.1600000000003
understand that i don't understand how

2990.96 --> 2994.2400000000002
that works

2992.16 --> 2995.92
i just do what i do and somebody would

2994.24 --> 2999.04
have to basically

2995.92 --> 3002.16
take me in as a stooge

2999.04 --> 3004.16
like an assistant and then just like

3002.16 --> 3006.48
how about this what do you think about

3004.16 --> 3010.0789999999997
that ask me for advice

3006.48 --> 3012.72
and then relay that with me like okay

3010.079 --> 3013.52
this is what we need currently we don't

3012.72 --> 3015.839
have anyone

3013.52 --> 3017.359
you think you can do that under a little

3015.839 --> 3020.319
guidance

3017.359 --> 3020.72
and then i try it out but i cannot offer

3020.319 --> 3023.92
my

3020.72 --> 3026.3999999999996
professional i can't

3023.92 --> 3028.0
offer it as a professional because i am

3026.4 --> 3029.76
not a professional i've never done

3028.0 --> 3033.52
anything like that i have not done

3029.76 --> 3036.6400000000003
any studies i've never sat through

3033.52 --> 3040.8
the production of a game

3036.64 --> 3042.5589999999997
i've read about it and that's it

3040.8 --> 3044.4
so i would have to be somebody would

3042.559 --> 3048.1600000000003
have to really believe in me

3044.4 --> 3049.92
and then take me in as a stooge

3048.16 --> 3051.7599999999998
and then see what they can do with me

3049.92 --> 3053.599
and then i might be able to figure it

3051.76 --> 3056.96
out

3053.599 --> 3058.96
over time no guarantees that's it that's

3056.96 --> 3060.2400000000002
the wizard the presorches apprentice

3058.96 --> 3063.04
right

3060.24 --> 3063.04
something like that

3066.96 --> 3071.2
amiga was pretty good amiga was the best

3073.2 --> 3080.96
amiga had the best

3077.119 --> 3080.96
sound quality of computers

3081.28 --> 3088.2400000000002
of the entire 20th century absolutely

3085.119 --> 3090.6400000000003
the best sound effects

3088.24 --> 3092.3999999999996
made by a computer in the 20th century

3090.64 --> 3095.68
was the amiga

3092.4 --> 3098.8
absolutely and i still think

3095.68 --> 3101.5989999999997
like the sounds that come from that is

3098.8 --> 3101.599
are amazing

3277.04 --> 3280.0
hey amanda young

3280.16 --> 3293.839
what's up

3304.0 --> 3307.92
which it wants to debate me on right

3306.319 --> 3311.44
right

3307.92 --> 3311.44
i don't see any point okay

3315.68 --> 3322.3999999999996
right would you guys like me to get tony

3319.599 --> 3322.4
the real one

3323.359 --> 3326.48
or you want me to just continue me

3325.839 --> 3329.44
talking

3326.48 --> 3329.44
i'll leave it up to you

3331.52 --> 3335.839
and talking about sleeping warrior of

3333.44 --> 3335.839
course

3368.559 --> 3374.7200000000003
all right okay well tony

3371.839 --> 3376.0
it's tough yeah sleeping warrior kind of

3374.72 --> 3378.319
wants to discuss i

3376.0 --> 3381.119
guess that he was invited to go on a

3378.319 --> 3383.68
debate with wits it

3381.119 --> 3387.119
but he says he doesn't see any point i

3383.68 --> 3387.1189999999997
do kind of agree with that

3387.28 --> 3392.0
because like why it's just gonna be

3390.24 --> 3393.52
probably the same [ __ ] i think that

3392.0 --> 3396.799
brian already pretty much

3393.52 --> 3396.799
did did everything

3398.88 --> 3402.559
because it's just gonna be the same

3400.4 --> 3404.0
nonsense again and just people yelling

3402.559 --> 3406.1600000000003
at oh relative density

3404.0 --> 3407.599
doesn't prove anything oh wait it does

3406.16 --> 3409.5589999999997
prove it's almost

3407.599 --> 3411.44
everything but there's just this

3409.559 --> 3414.079
phenomenally small

3411.44 --> 3416.079
extra thing that causes it all even

3414.079 --> 3417.92
though it's insignificant

3416.079 --> 3420.1600000000003
right that sort of [ __ ] is just gonna

3417.92 --> 3422.48
come rolling out

3420.16 --> 3422.48
again

3423.76 --> 3428.0
so i don't really see much of a point

3427.44 --> 3433.839
either

3428.0 --> 3436.24
why he should do it

3433.839 --> 3437.92
i didn't anthony challenge with which it

3436.24 --> 3442.4799999999996
on the fed free show

3437.92 --> 3444.48
diddy i did not see the fed pre-show

3442.48 --> 3461.839

3471.44 --> 3478.88
what are you talking about

3475.119 --> 3482.0
he did okay well now he says he doesn't

3478.88 --> 3482.0
see any point in it

3482.079 --> 3489.8390000000004
i don't know

3500.839 --> 3503.839
do

3514.839 --> 3517.839
what

3526.079 --> 3531.8390000000004

3640.839 --> 3643.839
that

3652.24 --> 3659.68
oh goody amanda young

3655.68 --> 3659.68
yeah it sucks i can imagine

3660.319 --> 3664.64
oh did you know by the way that did i

3662.72 --> 3667.4399999999996
tell that yeah i think it did

3664.64 --> 3671.839
that i went into like a store i was it

3667.44 --> 3671.839
yesterday or the day before

3672.4 --> 3676.079
i think was the day before i went into

3674.319 --> 3678.64
this store where they had musically

3676.079 --> 3680.079
signs like you have to wear a mask you

3678.64 --> 3682.0789999999997
must wear a mask

3680.079 --> 3684.2400000000002
and i ignored all of them just went in

3682.079 --> 3687.28
the store without a mask i was literally

3684.24 --> 3690.319
the only one in the store without a mask

3687.28 --> 3693.119
and nobody freaking addressed me on it

3690.319 --> 3695.68
not a single person and i even talked

3693.119 --> 3696.7200000000003
face-to-face to two different employees

3695.68 --> 3698.3999999999996
working there

3696.72 --> 3701.2
and they would just help me out they did

3698.4 --> 3704.4
not even say wear a mask single time

3701.2 --> 3713.839
now that was a weird experience that was

3704.4 --> 3713.839
kind of weird

3718.64 --> 3723.2
because i was just like like i don't

3720.72 --> 3726.64
care i don't care

3723.2 --> 3729.2
i don't care that you're telling me

3726.64 --> 3731.2799999999997
i have to do that it's just not true

3729.2 --> 3733.4399999999996
it's like i don't care

3731.28 --> 3735.28
now if somebody would have gotten in my

3733.44 --> 3737.359
face and then actually like hey

3735.28 --> 3738.88
dude you have to wear it or will i call

3737.359 --> 3741.2
the police or some [ __ ]

3738.88 --> 3742.0
i probably had put it on because i do

3741.2 --> 3744.5589999999997
have one

3742.0 --> 3747.359
because yeah i can't get in a coffee

3744.559 --> 3750.4
shop without one unfortunately

3747.359 --> 3751.359
right but i just like now [ __ ] it i'm

3750.4 --> 3754.4
not gonna read

3751.359 --> 3754.799
any signs all these balls every time i

3754.4 --> 3758.0
see

3754.799 --> 3759.839
covet blah blah blah i literally erase

3758.0 --> 3762.559
it from my eyes

3759.839 --> 3764.4
like i just see blur i don't care i

3762.559 --> 3766.6400000000003
don't care whatever it says

3764.4 --> 3767.52
whatever it's gonna say i i'm not

3766.64 --> 3769.5989999999997
reading it

3767.52 --> 3771.28
as soon as i see it's about corona in

3769.599 --> 3774.96
any way i literally

3771.28 --> 3776.799
blur it in my brain i don't see it

3774.96 --> 3781.599
anymore i just don't see it

3776.799 --> 3784.24
i don't care erase it

3781.599 --> 3784.2400000000002
erase it

3794.839 --> 3797.839
right

3800.64 --> 3808.24
wow you went to a

3803.68 --> 3811.359
hospital for covet how pathetic

3808.24 --> 3812.0789999999997
what the [ __ ] why would you go to a

3811.359 --> 3815.0389999999998
hospital

3812.079 --> 3815.76
for like one of the mildest forms of a

3815.039 --> 3818.559
cold

3815.76 --> 3820.7200000000003
you can contract why would you go to a

3818.559 --> 3823.6800000000003
hospital for that are you like

3820.72 --> 3825.5989999999997
high comorbidity risk or something

3823.68 --> 3829.1189999999997
because otherwise i don't see why

3825.599 --> 3832.1600000000003
anybody would go to a freaking hospital

3829.119 --> 3836.6400000000003
for like the mildest potential

3832.16 --> 3839.7599999999998
disease possible like i can't think of a

3836.64 --> 3841.839
milder freaking disease than covet why

3839.76 --> 3843.119
the hell would you go to a hospital for

3841.839 --> 3846.72
that

3843.119 --> 3846.7200000000003
it's absolutely ridiculous

3850.079 --> 3855.8390000000004
couldn't breathe all right

3854.4 --> 3859.119
have you considered that it might not

3855.839 --> 3862.4
have been coveted because

3859.119 --> 3865.76
you needed oxygen wow

3862.4 --> 3867.92
so i take it you have serious lung

3865.76 --> 3869.599
problems even before you contracted this

3867.92 --> 3872.799
covet

3869.599 --> 3876.4
it's pretty weird so

3872.799 --> 3876.4
yeah comorbidities i guess

3878.88 --> 3884.319
then it makes sense look if you've

3880.24 --> 3884.319
always had lung problems yeah i get it

3884.48 --> 3888.16
yeah then it might be very scary and

3886.72 --> 3889.9199999999996
then you might have to go to the

3888.16 --> 3891.44
hospital because your lungs are already

3889.92 --> 3894.0
kind of shitty

3891.44 --> 3894.7200000000003
and then yeah i get it you know i'm not

3894.0 --> 3896.64
saying that

3894.72 --> 3898.3999999999996
nobody should ever only any

3896.64 --> 3902.24
circumstances like

3898.4 --> 3906.1600000000003
try to get help if they actually have

3902.24 --> 3909.359
a weak set of lungs already you know

3906.16 --> 3910.799
but the average person just that's just

3909.359 --> 3914.0789999999997
ridiculous

3910.799 --> 3916.4
most people that get this supposed covet

3914.079 --> 3917.119
which in my opinion is not even really a

3916.4 --> 3920.079
virus

3917.119 --> 3922.0
virus theory is just completely debunked

3920.079 --> 3924.319
i i would rather go for the

3922.0 --> 3925.92
terrain theory right it's just the

3924.319 --> 3928.88
metabolic overhaul system

3925.92 --> 3931.359
the cleanup poison that gathers

3928.88 --> 3932.96
naturally in on a cellular level

3931.359 --> 3935.52
and in certain circumstances you get

3932.96 --> 3936.16
sick to to eject all that it's just a

3935.52 --> 3939.24
metabolic

3936.16 --> 3942.5589999999997
process and viruses are the

3939.24 --> 3944.5589999999997
executors the things of your body that

3942.559 --> 3945.8390000000004
actually clean it up so it's not even a

3944.559 --> 3948.88
hostile agent it's an

3945.839 --> 3951.2
inherent microbiological mechanism

3948.88 --> 3954.48
that's how i see it right so it's all

3951.2 --> 3958.72
just [ __ ] story everything about it

3954.48 --> 3961.599
right most people that get this

3958.72 --> 3962.16
officially registered covet they don't

3961.599 --> 3965.76
even

3962.16 --> 3969.5989999999997
know it they don't even know they got it

3965.76 --> 3973.5200000000004
and it goes away very quickly so yeah

3969.599 --> 3975.839
completely completely ridiculous

3973.52 --> 3976.96
but hey if you got problems with your

3975.839 --> 3978.88
lungs and [ __ ]

3976.96 --> 3980.4
already you've always had that or you've

3978.88 --> 3982.88
had operations or

3980.4 --> 3984.4
maybe you had lung cancer you know and

3982.88 --> 3987.76
survived that

3984.4 --> 3991.52
yeah i get it any sort of kind of

3987.76 --> 3994.7200000000003
anything that would give you problems

3991.52 --> 3996.48
yeah that's that sucks

3994.72 --> 3998.319
that sucks and you would probably have

3996.48 --> 3999.359
to go to the hospital because you

3998.319 --> 4002.4
already have

3999.359 --> 4005.359
yeah vulnerable lungs then i get it

4002.4 --> 4006.48
but anything other than that it's just

4005.359 --> 4009.92
absurd

4006.48 --> 4013.92
it's absurd to do to even

4009.92 --> 4013.92
respond to it in any sort of way

4016.72 --> 4020.319
yeah noah just nobody's died of covid

4019.52 --> 4023.7599999999998
not a

4020.319 --> 4026.96
single person nobody dies of a coals

4023.76 --> 4030.2400000000002
nobody ever not a

4026.96 --> 4033.44
single person nobody nobody dies of it

4030.24 --> 4034.0
not a single individual not a single

4033.44 --> 4037.839
individual

4034.0 --> 4040.799
could ever just die of that ever

4037.839 --> 4041.2799999999997
it's only again they have a weakened

4040.799 --> 4042.96
system

4041.28 --> 4044.6400000000003
like i described you have weakened lungs

4042.96 --> 4048.0
you might have cancer you might

4044.64 --> 4050.0789999999997
operations all kinds of things and then

4048.0 --> 4052.72
you have a vulnerable system and then it

4050.079 --> 4056.0
just might be that little little push

4052.72 --> 4058.319
that can send you into death potentially

4056.0 --> 4060.72
because it's already weakened oh guess

4058.319 --> 4064.079
what that's called co-morbidity

4060.72 --> 4065.52
there's nothing to do with the freaking

4064.079 --> 4067.039
covet because

4065.52 --> 4068.72
you know what could also kill you in

4067.039 --> 4071.28
that state

4068.72 --> 4073.2799999999997
falling over on the pavement and hitting

4071.28 --> 4075.599
your head really hard

4073.28 --> 4078.1600000000003
in a weakened state that can also kill

4075.599 --> 4080.88
you right just falling over

4078.16 --> 4084.0789999999997
in a weakened state right that can kill

4080.88 --> 4086.559
you just as much as contracting a cold

4084.079 --> 4087.44
so to claim that it can literally kill

4086.559 --> 4090.0
somebody is just

4087.44 --> 4091.52
absolutely preposterous it can never do

4090.0 --> 4095.039
that ever

4091.52 --> 4098.159
ever nobody's ever died of it

4095.039 --> 4101.1990000000005
ever and could ever die of it unless

4098.159 --> 4104.639999999999
they had severe conditions

4101.199 --> 4107.199
at the offset and then it's just that

4104.64 --> 4108.799
little little push that'll just yeah

4107.199 --> 4112.639999999999
finish it off

4108.799 --> 4115.759
but it on its own could never

4112.64 --> 4118.64
ever kill a single person

4115.759 --> 4120.239
or any kind of animal for that matter

4118.64 --> 4123.679
ever

4120.239 --> 4123.678999999999
yeah ever

4128.88 --> 4137.359
right thousands ways to die

4132.799 --> 4137.359
and getting a cold is not one of them

4139.92 --> 4143.12
you could die of some serious fluid you

4142.0 --> 4145.839
know like

4143.12 --> 4148.0
when you get real like inflammation like

4145.839 --> 4150.5599999999995
a serious flu a real flu

4148.0 --> 4151.6
this is not it this is not a flu it's a

4150.56 --> 4154.719
freaking cold it's

4151.6 --> 4155.679
nothing nothing nothing nothing barely

4154.719 --> 4159.04
noticeable

4155.679 --> 4162.56
right but a serious flu that can happen

4159.04 --> 4164.96
and yeah that can actually kill you like

4162.56 --> 4167.04
really like even somebody that thinks

4164.96 --> 4168.88
that they're relatively healthy

4167.04 --> 4171.359
they might have some [ __ ] heaped up in

4168.88 --> 4173.04
their body some pharmaceuticals they've

4171.359 --> 4175.04
been taking over the years and then they

4173.04 --> 4176.159
get a very serious flu all of sudden

4175.04 --> 4179.679
yeah that can

4176.159 --> 4181.3589999999995
actually kill a person even if they

4179.679 --> 4183.359
don't have comorbidities it's

4181.359 --> 4186.08
potentially possible

4183.359 --> 4187.120000000001
yeah that's true whatever you think the

4186.08 --> 4189.5199999999995
flu really is

4187.12 --> 4190.48
a real flu right influenza whatever you

4189.52 --> 4193.759
think that is

4190.48 --> 4197.04
it can potentially kill people

4193.759 --> 4200.32
covet cannot under

4197.04 --> 4204.08
any circumstances unless you are already

4200.32 --> 4206.239
comorbid to a level where just this

4204.08 --> 4207.199
little little push will send you over

4206.239 --> 4210.159
the edge

4207.199 --> 4211.36
and that's the only way it could ever

4210.159 --> 4217.839999999999
contribute

4211.36 --> 4217.839999999999
in any way to somebody dying yeah

4224.64 --> 4228.2390000000005
but the symptoms aren't different they

4226.64 --> 4231.52
are exactly that

4228.239 --> 4234.959999999999
the symptoms are that of a cold a basic

4231.52 --> 4246.64
lame-ass cold that barely registers

4234.96 --> 4246.64
that's what it does what's going on

4249.04 --> 4252.4
freaking stalling [ __ ]

4254.239 --> 4257.28
yeah well a kumu virus you never had a

4256.159 --> 4260.239
colon you couldn't breathe

4257.28 --> 4261.84
well maybe that's because you never had

4260.239 --> 4264.959999999999
very serious lung

4261.84 --> 4265.679
situations and comorbidity factors and

4264.96 --> 4267.04
then

4265.679 --> 4270.64
caught a cold have you ever thought

4267.04 --> 4272.32
about that huh

4270.64 --> 4274.0
you're trying to be a smart ass here

4272.32 --> 4275.04
you're trying to defend the freaking

4274.0 --> 4278.08
covet

4275.04 --> 4286.8
like a sycophant slave are you a muzzle

4278.08 --> 4288.96
slave akuma virus

4286.8 --> 4292.719
yeah lung lesions yeah yeah yeah well

4288.96 --> 4292.719
what where do you get those from

4298.84 --> 4301.84
huh

4303.52 --> 4307.280000000001
where do you get the lung lesions from

4308.0 --> 4314.159
yeah can you show me somebody

4311.44 --> 4316.239
let's let's cut it that's got these

4314.159 --> 4318.799999999999
supposed lung lesions

4316.239 --> 4320.32
i don't think so i think that those fall

4318.8 --> 4323.360000000001
under

4320.32 --> 4326.5599999999995
literal scam artist predictions and not

4323.36 --> 4328.0
actually proven facts because the only

4326.56 --> 4331.120000000001
lung lesions that i know

4328.0 --> 4334.4
of i've heard of are

4331.12 --> 4336.5599999999995
people that have breathers rammed

4334.4 --> 4338.08
down their throat yeah those calls the

4336.56 --> 4342.320000000001
freaking lung lesions

4338.08 --> 4344.88
yeah not a minor cold

4342.32 --> 4346.88
the sniffles it does not it doesn't do

4344.88 --> 4347.76
any damage most people that contracted

4346.88 --> 4350.96
don't even know

4347.76 --> 4353.1990000000005
they ever got it all right so it's

4350.96 --> 4355.199
absolute [ __ ] there's misinformation

4353.199 --> 4358.239
don't do that

4355.199 --> 4358.239
yeah man don't

4358.8 --> 4362.56
from scientific papers oh sure yeah yeah

4361.92 --> 4364.719
well i

4362.56 --> 4368.0
i know like hundreds of doctors that

4364.719 --> 4371.92
will absolutely say that's a scam

4368.0 --> 4373.28
with their own research yeah on video

4371.92 --> 4375.4400000000005
and they're all being taken down of

4373.28 --> 4377.599999999999
course because it's a medical

4375.44 --> 4379.599999999999
dictatorship

4377.6 --> 4382.719
and i will not be part of it and if you

4379.6 --> 4385.120000000001
are part of it you can get the [ __ ] out

4382.719 --> 4387.84
because you are part of the problem you

4385.12 --> 4390.4
are part of the medical industrial

4387.84 --> 4392.08
tyranny that's been unleashed on this

4390.4 --> 4398.799999999999
world

4392.08 --> 4401.199
yeah in those scientific papers you have

4398.8 --> 4403.04
that support that supposedly you

4401.199 --> 4404.239
probably didn't even read them right you

4403.04 --> 4407.44
just

4404.239 --> 4410.159
you just read something

4407.44 --> 4410.5599999999995
that supposedly had a conclusion it's

4410.159 --> 4413.599999999999
all

4410.56 --> 4417.679
exactly as fouchy and on the [ __ ]

4413.6 --> 4420.96
liar say right i'll go [ __ ] yourself

4417.679 --> 4424.0
it's all a scam it's literally a scam

4420.96 --> 4427.199
people are resignating as

4424.0 --> 4429.96
doctors as nurses around the world

4427.199 --> 4431.12
because they are finding out and

4429.96 --> 4434.96
testifying

4431.12 --> 4438.08
how it is a giant giant

4434.96 --> 4441.719
world size scam

4438.08 --> 4445.199
medical industrial complex scam

4441.719 --> 4449.159
financially tied in scam

4445.199 --> 4452.879999999999
fraud statistical fraud

4449.159 --> 4456.159
provable registered statistical

4452.88 --> 4469.84
fraud yeah so

4456.159 --> 4469.839999999999
good luck with that

4471.52 --> 4475.52
man you were treated well man i'm gonna

4474.159 --> 4483.04
treat you with

4475.52 --> 4487.92
banning [ __ ] off

4483.04 --> 4489.44
filthy medical industrial complex shill

4487.92 --> 4491.76
yeah and there's a lot of those by the

4489.44 --> 4492.879999999999
way out there people that are literally

4491.76 --> 4497.12
on the payroll

4492.88 --> 4500.719
to defend the medical industrial complex

4497.12 --> 4502.719
yeah there's hundreds of them

4500.719 --> 4504.08
out there hundreds all over the place

4502.719 --> 4506.64
all over the internet that

4504.08 --> 4508.64
literally hill for the medical

4506.64 --> 4512.0
industrial complex

4508.64 --> 4515.280000000001
that go after the anti-vaxxers

4512.0 --> 4518.4
that go after anything that contradicts

4515.28 --> 4520.239
the mainstream medical opinion

4518.4 --> 4522.48
of what everybody should be doing and

4520.239 --> 4525.839999999999
what should be law and

4522.48 --> 4527.919999999999
all that crap yeah and this guy mn

4525.84 --> 4530.0
apparently is part of that so he can

4527.92 --> 4533.28
[ __ ] off

4530.0 --> 4538.8
disgusting chill necromancer

4533.28 --> 4543.12
shill is what you are

4538.8 --> 4547.12
right and yeah cancer

4543.12 --> 4550.159
treat what vitamin c why not

4547.12 --> 4551.84
you know but yeah you're

4550.159 --> 4554.239
probably one of those individuals that

4551.84 --> 4558.96
would adamantly deny that there's like

4554.239 --> 4561.759999999999
a hundred different very solid

4558.96 --> 4562.32
ways to treat cancer and survive it

4561.76 --> 4565.84
without

4562.32 --> 4566.96
any freaking involvement of chemotherapy

4565.84 --> 4570.32
radiation

4566.96 --> 4571.36
or surgery whatsoever without any of

4570.32 --> 4574.96
that

4571.36 --> 4578.5599999999995
hundreds hundreds of methods

4574.96 --> 4581.84
to treat cancer hundreds of effective

4578.56 --> 4585.04
tested over the ages methods

4581.84 --> 4585.04
yeah that's right

4585.44 --> 4591.599999999999
that's right hundreds of methods

4588.96 --> 4593.12
because cancer is probably one of the

4591.6 --> 4596.320000000001
most treatable

4593.12 --> 4598.5599999999995
things in the human body that

4596.32 --> 4600.0
the medical industrial complex never

4598.56 --> 4603.679
wants you to learn about

4600.0 --> 4604.18
because it's huge money for them huge

4603.679 --> 4607.279
money

4604.18 --> 4607.279
[Music]

4608.0 --> 4611.76
there are you can literally cure your

4610.8 --> 4614.4800000000005
own cancer

4611.76 --> 4615.76
without barely any side effects or a

4614.48 --> 4620.08
hassle

4615.76 --> 4622.96
so many ways to do that so many ways

4620.08 --> 4625.84
right one of them anchored in like cbd

4622.96 --> 4629.04
oil it's a great start out

4625.84 --> 4631.4400000000005
baking soda therapy

4629.04 --> 4633.199
so that's just on the top of my mind you

4631.44 --> 4634.08
know there's there's so many different

4633.199 --> 4637.199
ways to do it

4634.08 --> 4639.84
it's incredible and you

4637.199 --> 4641.199
never ever need any kind of form of

4639.84 --> 4644.4800000000005
chemotherapy

4641.199 --> 4646.799999999999
radiation or surgery ever to cure it it

4644.48 --> 4649.12
will just go away

4646.8 --> 4650.719
you know why because cancer is not a

4649.12 --> 4653.28
disease

4650.719 --> 4654.32
just like these supposed viruses it's

4653.28 --> 4658.159
inherent

4654.32 --> 4660.88
to your body's metabolic mechanisms

4658.159 --> 4661.839999999999
and german new medicine teaches you

4660.88 --> 4664.64
about that

4661.84 --> 4665.679
very specifically what it is what its

4664.64 --> 4668.8
function is

4665.679 --> 4669.52
why why do you get cancer in a certain

4668.8 --> 4672.320000000001
location

4669.52 --> 4674.400000000001
there's a reason for this it's a reason

4672.32 --> 4676.719
that correlates

4674.4 --> 4678.0
like with how the energies in your body

4676.719 --> 4680.88
works how your psyche

4678.0 --> 4683.12
and how your emotions work there is a

4680.88 --> 4685.28
correlation to where there is cancerous

4683.12 --> 4687.599999999999
activity

4685.28 --> 4689.599999999999
and where you are at life and what

4687.6 --> 4694.0
you've been confronted with

4689.6 --> 4695.84
and these are studied and empirically

4694.0 --> 4698.159
proven facts

4695.84 --> 4699.12
empirically proven facts in a court of

4698.159 --> 4702.4
law

4699.12 --> 4704.64
could not be refuted scientific evidence

4702.4 --> 4706.239
dr hammer yeah i know he's been

4704.64 --> 4709.84
condemned and all that

4706.239 --> 4713.759999999999
but that part of the german new medicine

4709.84 --> 4715.4400000000005
he's proven the court could not disprove

4713.76 --> 4718.96
on his scientific

4715.44 --> 4721.28
facts and research oh

4718.96 --> 4722.64
and that's why nobody knows he exists

4721.28 --> 4725.5199999999995
and every time he's brought up

4722.64 --> 4726.2390000000005
he's called a nazi because they really

4725.52 --> 4729.719
don't like

4726.239 --> 4732.0
that he's proven in court

4729.719 --> 4733.04
scientifically that his german new

4732.0 --> 4736.88
medicine

4733.04 --> 4737.6
actually works yeah nobody wants to know

4736.88 --> 4741.12
that do they

4737.6 --> 4741.120000000001
hmm yeah

4741.84 --> 4747.22
i do

4744.07 --> 4747.219999999999
[Music]

4747.6 --> 4751.360000000001
all right i got a message back from tony

4749.84 --> 4753.360000000001
by the way about the

4751.36 --> 4755.36
the supposed challenge apparently he

4753.36 --> 4756.239
said he's challenged him for an

4755.36 --> 4759.28
experiment

4756.239 --> 4761.44
a demonstration and not a debate

4759.28 --> 4762.5599999999995
so tony does not want to go into the

4761.44 --> 4765.759999999999
debate he just wants

4762.56 --> 4767.52
an experiment by which it to

4765.76 --> 4777.84
back up his claim and i kind of agree to

4767.52 --> 4777.84
that so that that is what that is

4781.02 --> 4784.409000000001
[Music]

4786.76 --> 4791.319
[Music]

4798.64 --> 4802.320000000001
you cannot use public transport without

4800.719 --> 4804.64
getting faxed

4802.32 --> 4805.5199999999995
well if that would really be the case

4804.64 --> 4809.52
that would mean

4805.52 --> 4812.639
absolute collapse of public transport

4809.52 --> 4814.400000000001
and eventually hijacking you know if

4812.639 --> 4817.92
literally if you can't

4814.4 --> 4820.32
if you have to like effectively die

4817.92 --> 4824.639
effectively mark yourself for

4820.32 --> 4826.799999999999
for a quicker or more rapid

4824.639 --> 4829.04
approach to death because you will grow

4826.8 --> 4831.360000000001
older at least from that [ __ ]

4829.04 --> 4833.199
who knows sterilizing all that to get a

4831.36 --> 4835.36
public transport then at some point

4833.199 --> 4838.5599999999995
people are just gonna freaking hijack it

4835.36 --> 4840.88
and say okay get the [ __ ] out

4838.56 --> 4842.88
i'm just going to take this freaking bus

4840.88 --> 4845.679
or whatever it is and train and just

4842.88 --> 4847.4400000000005
bring people just say no come on i'm

4845.679 --> 4849.04
just doing it for free

4847.44 --> 4850.879999999999
you can get on for free you don't have

4849.04 --> 4852.88
to have anything you can just get on

4850.88 --> 4855.4400000000005
this and i will transport you there

4852.88 --> 4857.92
until the police stops me that sort of

4855.44 --> 4861.44
[ __ ] will start to happen then

4857.92 --> 4864.8
because it has to it's unacceptable

4861.44 --> 4864.799999999999
what people would do

4865.36 --> 4869.12
that they would force you to take a

4866.88 --> 4872.08
vaccine to to move

4869.12 --> 4872.88
which is illegal by the way it's a

4872.08 --> 4876.5599999999995
natural

4872.88 --> 4877.84
right a natural natural it's not even a

4876.56 --> 4881.120000000001
national thing it's a

4877.84 --> 4885.28
natural right to be able to just

4881.12 --> 4887.28
go anywhere it's your natural right

4885.28 --> 4888.639
unless it's a private property of

4887.28 --> 4890.639
somebody else

4888.639 --> 4892.4800000000005
like literally their personal private

4890.639 --> 4894.96
property then it's different

4892.48 --> 4897.759999999999
but you should be able to you should

4894.96 --> 4899.76
have the right to use public transport

4897.76 --> 4900.88
without being forced to do anything

4899.76 --> 4904.0
other than maybe

4900.88 --> 4907.679
pay a little money for the

4904.0 --> 4907.679
for the travel cost and that's it

4913.44 --> 4916.879999999999
they said they stopped my welfare unless

4915.36 --> 4919.839999999999
they get a vaccine

4916.88 --> 4920.400000000001
well then i would sue them for violating

4919.84 --> 4924.0
my

4920.4 --> 4926.08
right as a dutch-born citizen

4924.0 --> 4927.199
to welfare because that's in the

4926.08 --> 4931.84
constitution

4927.199 --> 4936.159
of the netherlands what i would do

4931.84 --> 4938.88
jedi online i don't think they will

4936.159 --> 4941.5199999999995
they cannot because it's literally my

4938.88 --> 4945.36
natural born right as a citizen

4941.52 --> 4948.4800000000005
and i have i use that right

4945.36 --> 4952.32
and if it's all gonna go to hell

4948.48 --> 4954.959999999999
then at some point i will just

4952.32 --> 4957.28
revoke my citizenship i will say well go

4954.96 --> 4959.04
[ __ ] yourself i hope you get nuked

4957.28 --> 4961.36
i hope this entire country gets [ __ ]

4959.04 --> 4965.28
nuked because there's nothing left of it

4961.36 --> 4969.44
it's just [ __ ] and i'll go away

4965.28 --> 4969.44
and tell everybody to go [ __ ] themselves

4970.84 --> 4974.639
right and at the same time yeah this

4973.6 --> 4977.04
over here

4974.639 --> 4979.6
look i will just tell everybody like

4977.04 --> 4982.639
guys uh

4979.6 --> 4985.52
i can't meet ends anymore

4982.639 --> 4987.52
you guys i have to help me out i have to

4985.52 --> 4989.92
get it from somewhere

4987.52 --> 4989.92
all that

4993.52 --> 5000.080000000001
all right all right how would i eat

4996.96 --> 5003.36
i don't know man i think that eating

5000.08 --> 5006.88
would be slightly less of a concern

5003.36 --> 5009.599999999999
as to like how am i going to

5006.88 --> 5010.56
basically move around without being

5009.6 --> 5013.1990000000005
mugged

5010.56 --> 5014.0
or murdered i think that would be a

5013.199 --> 5019.12
little bit

5014.0 --> 5019.12
bigger problem jedi online

5022.639 --> 5026.56
how can i afford to sue the government

5027.04 --> 5030.08
well i don't know

5030.239 --> 5034.799999999999
look if i can't i'll just join up with

5032.56 --> 5037.92
other people

5034.8 --> 5038.719
and start a revolution and freaking kill

5037.92 --> 5041.36
them all

5038.719 --> 5043.44
so like oh oh really so you've just

5041.36 --> 5045.679
negated the constitution

5043.44 --> 5048.48
to enforce a dictatorship okay that's

5045.679 --> 5050.56
fine then we're going to kill you all

5048.48 --> 5053.04
and i will not be alone there will be a

5050.56 --> 5056.080000000001
million people at least there will be

5053.04 --> 5058.96
like yeah they went too far

5056.08 --> 5060.32
this time and now they're going to die

5058.96 --> 5062.32
that's going to happen

5060.32 --> 5065.44
if they actually just start to break the

5062.32 --> 5065.44
constitution apart

5065.6 --> 5070.96
so that's it

5068.639 --> 5072.88
that's fine i've told that i've

5070.96 --> 5074.4800000000005
basically declared that it's like yeah

5072.88 --> 5078.159000000001
that's really nice but if

5074.48 --> 5081.44
i if situations are made such that i

5078.159 --> 5084.5599999999995
literally cannot survive anymore

5081.44 --> 5088.638999999999
then i will be their enemy and

5084.56 --> 5091.76
i will re-ensure my rights

5088.639 --> 5094.0
with violence as any

5091.76 --> 5095.280000000001
human being should when their rights are

5094.0 --> 5096.719
violated

5095.28 --> 5099.84
and there's nothing else you can do

5096.719 --> 5099.84
about it then it's war

5100.4 --> 5104.32
right so let's hope it never gets to

5102.8 --> 5107.6
that

5104.32 --> 5111.28
because yeah i don't like the idea

5107.6 --> 5115.120000000001
of being forced to basically do that

5111.28 --> 5118.159
but i will not gonna sit idly by just

5115.12 --> 5118.96
pray and slowly die i'm not gonna do

5118.159 --> 5124.08
that

5118.96 --> 5124.08
i no no i'm not gonna do that

5124.84 --> 5127.84
so

5132.56 --> 5136.0
i what the [ __ ] kind of a question is

5134.88 --> 5138.159000000001
that

5136.0 --> 5139.76
what kind of a [ __ ] question is that

5138.159 --> 5140.32
what you want to draw that [ __ ] out of

5139.76 --> 5142.96
me

5140.32 --> 5143.679
do i have to describe horrific details

5142.96 --> 5146.8
now

5143.679 --> 5149.12
you want to hear arwen describe the

5146.8 --> 5151.4400000000005
horrific details do i do i really have

5149.12 --> 5153.84
to go there earth passenger

5151.44 --> 5158.239
maybe you should check yourself as to

5153.84 --> 5158.2390000000005
why you would want to know that from me

5158.32 --> 5162.0
and i'm not going to use the bow dude do

5160.96 --> 5165.199
you think really

5162.0 --> 5167.199
no i'll just use my hands how about that

5165.199 --> 5169.839999999999
i'll use my hands

5167.199 --> 5170.879999999999
i'll use the pavement i'll use

5169.84 --> 5173.92
everything of my

5170.88 --> 5176.08
you don't need anything you don't

5173.92 --> 5178.56
need a weapon you can [ __ ] use your

5176.08 --> 5178.5599999999995
hands

5180.84 --> 5183.84
alright

5190.0 --> 5193.92
you run the government run me over with

5191.76 --> 5197.84
a tank that's very cute

5193.92 --> 5197.84
they can try sure

5202.96 --> 5206.4800000000005
but yeah tanks overall aren't that quick

5205.36 --> 5209.759999999999
or maneuverable

5206.48 --> 5214.0
so are your hands registered weapons

5209.76 --> 5217.12
no they're not because there are natural

5214.0 --> 5220.0
defense mechanisms that nobody can ever

5217.12 --> 5220.0
do anything about

5220.239 --> 5226.879999999999
like i am armed see i got arms

5224.0 --> 5228.56
and there's literally nothing anybody

5226.88 --> 5231.76
can do about that

5228.56 --> 5231.76
all right nothing

5232.48 --> 5236.879999999999
yeah that's really cute well that's fine

5234.48 --> 5237.759999999999
look jedi online if they want to go as

5236.88 --> 5240.639
far as to

5237.76 --> 5242.400000000001
literally start mowing down millions of

5240.639 --> 5245.84
people

5242.4 --> 5246.08
like a scumbag dictatorship then so be

5245.84 --> 5249.679
it

5246.08 --> 5252.96
then we shall all die alright

5249.679 --> 5255.1990000000005
alright you want to hear it if they come

5252.96 --> 5257.52
and they start mowing down and throw

5255.199 --> 5262.32
lobbing grenades into crowds

5257.52 --> 5262.320000000001
then we all die okay

5262.88 --> 5266.4800000000005
is that what you want to hear then we

5265.76 --> 5270.08
all

5266.48 --> 5270.08
die all right

5272.56 --> 5276.2390000000005
all right well you are a [ __ ]

5274.8 --> 5280.719
infiltrator scumbag

5276.239 --> 5284.0
you can go kill yourself and [ __ ] off

5280.719 --> 5287.36
you scumbag you're a [ __ ] scumbag

5284.0 --> 5292.8
you hear me dictator defending

5287.36 --> 5292.799999999999
scumbag go [ __ ] yourself get the [ __ ]

5292.84 --> 5295.84
out

5303.36 --> 5307.199
most people in my country on welfare

5307.6 --> 5312.08
i i don't know i don't know for sure

5310.32 --> 5313.12
earth passenger i know there's a lot of

5312.08 --> 5316.719
it

5313.12 --> 5319.12
a lot and most people are maximized

5316.719 --> 5321.12
like they have like oh they have the

5319.12 --> 5322.88
special welfare for this and they have a

5321.12 --> 5324.88
special welfare for that

5322.88 --> 5327.04
and like they have the special welfare

5324.88 --> 5328.4800000000005
because of their mental handicap or some

5327.04 --> 5331.679
drug they've taken

5328.48 --> 5334.159
there's all this [ __ ] that people

5331.679 --> 5335.1990000000005
get themselves into to get the maximum

5334.159 --> 5337.44
money

5335.199 --> 5338.879999999999
because they really think it's so they

5337.44 --> 5341.199
need it so much right

5338.88 --> 5342.0
i only have the absolute minimum you

5341.199 --> 5344.0
know why

5342.0 --> 5345.76
because it's in the constitution that

5344.0 --> 5348.32
that's my right

5345.76 --> 5349.6
and there's nothing anybody can do about

5348.32 --> 5351.92
it without

5349.6 --> 5353.84
literally destroying the constitution

5351.92 --> 5356.32
and when they do that

5353.84 --> 5357.6
yeah shit's gonna hit the fan big time

5356.32 --> 5358.48
because you don't just change the

5357.6 --> 5361.6
constitution

5358.48 --> 5362.0
right but i don't have extras i don't

5361.6 --> 5365.360000000001
have

5362.0 --> 5367.44
extra welfare [ __ ] i don't

5365.36 --> 5368.639
have anything registered about it i

5367.44 --> 5372.0
don't have any

5368.639 --> 5374.2390000000005
issues that are registered

5372.0 --> 5375.12
for anything that they can basically

5374.239 --> 5377.5199999999995
abuse

5375.12 --> 5378.719
to try and manipulate me and maneuver me

5377.52 --> 5381.679
to do things

5378.719 --> 5382.719
they cannot do it because i only have

5381.679 --> 5384.55
the minimum

5382.719 --> 5387.729
welfare

5384.55 --> 5387.729
[Music]

5388.639 --> 5393.76
there's nothing they can do about it but

5391.6 --> 5397.679
wreck the constitution

5393.76 --> 5397.679
and basically cause a revolution

5398.32 --> 5401.28
and i don't think they'd be willing to

5399.84 --> 5403.1990000000005
go there because that would pretty much

5401.28 --> 5404.239
be the end of the netherlands as we know

5403.199 --> 5407.839999999999
it

5404.239 --> 5407.839999999999
that's not going to recover after that

5412.32 --> 5416.0
that's right earth passenger i know

5418.239 --> 5424.799999999999
i know well it this is the netherlands

5421.679 --> 5424.8
and that's the way it is

5425.12 --> 5435.84
and i'm okay with that

5443.12 --> 5449.84
hey roger by the way

5460.8 --> 5465.92
yeah yeah yeah yeah our supposed health

5464.0 --> 5469.28
prime minister

5465.92 --> 5471.84
and just the prime minister himself

5469.28 --> 5474.08
they need to be arrested they literally

5471.84 --> 5476.639
need to be arrested they're criminals

5474.08 --> 5478.239
they're they've committed fraud

5476.639 --> 5480.96
financial fraud they've

5478.239 --> 5482.5599999999995
lied to no end it's provable it's all

5480.96 --> 5484.8
provable in court

5482.56 --> 5486.080000000001
and i've seen many articles from

5484.8 --> 5488.96
different sources that say

5486.08 --> 5491.04
he needs to be they need to be arrested

5488.96 --> 5492.719
and it's probably going to happen

5491.04 --> 5494.4
and when it does all this shit's going

5492.719 --> 5497.12
to be done it's going to be done

5494.4 --> 5498.4
it's going to be over this nonsense

5497.12 --> 5500.08
covet [ __ ]

5498.4 --> 5500.679999999999
yeah the globalism it's all going to be

5500.08 --> 5501.92
over

5500.68 --> 5504.8
[Music]

5501.92 --> 5505.28
can't wait till it happens and it has to

5504.8 --> 5507.1990000000005
happen

5505.28 --> 5509.12
because if this will continue to

5507.199 --> 5510.08
aggravate then the scenario that i

5509.12 --> 5514.159
presented

5510.08 --> 5518.08
will happen and we'll have a civil war

5514.159 --> 5519.5199999999995
or rather just yeah dragging politicians

5518.08 --> 5521.92
out of their houses and that sort of

5519.52 --> 5523.679
[ __ ] not really a civil war because

5521.92 --> 5525.76
i don't think there's enough public to

5523.679 --> 5528.159
actually defend them

5525.76 --> 5530.2390000000005
because everybody hates these freaks in

5528.159 --> 5531.839999999999
politics right now everybody

5530.239 --> 5534.159
everybody disagrees like even people

5531.84 --> 5536.56
that believe kovit [ __ ]

5534.159 --> 5538.08
disagree with what they're doing because

5536.56 --> 5539.76
it's the proof is already there

5538.08 --> 5542.8
that all these supposed measures and

5539.76 --> 5543.52
lockdowns are absolutely [ __ ] and

5542.8 --> 5546.08
useless

5543.52 --> 5546.8
they only ever serve to destroy the

5546.08 --> 5549.199
economy

5546.8 --> 5550.159000000001
and destroy our minds and our morale

5549.199 --> 5552.48
because they're not

5550.159 --> 5555.04
effective according to their own

5552.48 --> 5557.678999999999
freaking concepts

5555.04 --> 5560.8
it literally doesn't work by their own

5557.679 --> 5562.2390000000005
standards and it's being ignored

5560.8 --> 5564.0
and everybody knows that by now

5562.239 --> 5565.04
everybody's figured it out that actually

5564.0 --> 5566.96
wants to know

5565.04 --> 5568.159
they figured it out whether you believe

5566.96 --> 5570.8
any of it

5568.159 --> 5573.04
if you believe it then even within the

5570.8 --> 5576.08
convention of that belief

5573.04 --> 5577.92
it's absolutely disproven that anything

5576.08 --> 5580.32
they're doing right now is effective

5577.92 --> 5581.1990000000005
even within the convention of the belief

5580.32 --> 5584.08
that it's real

5581.199 --> 5585.44
right then you go outside of it and it's

5584.08 --> 5589.28
even worse

5585.44 --> 5591.759999999999
so nobody's buying that [ __ ] here nobody

5589.28 --> 5592.639
they all know it's completely [ __ ]

5591.76 --> 5595.04
it's

5592.639 --> 5596.159000000001
just trying to push and mind control

5595.04 --> 5597.76
people

5596.159 --> 5600.08
that's it that's the only thing it is

5597.76 --> 5603.84
and everybody knows it

5600.08 --> 5603.84
then people that believe in covet

5604.719 --> 5608.08
yeah if they have informed themselves

5606.719 --> 5609.76
then they should know that

5608.08 --> 5612.32
all these supposed measures don't even

5609.76 --> 5615.1990000000005
work they they can't even work by the

5612.32 --> 5619.04
convention of the belief that it's real

5615.199 --> 5619.04
all right it's completely [ __ ]

5625.6 --> 5631.84
yes a reminiscent stone yeah i'm gonna

5627.28 --> 5631.84
round that in a few minutes

5641.76 --> 5645.76
plus you have to pay back your will for

5643.84 --> 5647.52
if you make money don't you yes that's

5645.76 --> 5650.320000000001
right random explorer

5647.52 --> 5652.159000000001
it's like all the advertisement money

5650.32 --> 5652.88
all the super chats that come through

5652.159 --> 5656.0
google

5652.88 --> 5658.719
i pretty much have to pay back 98

5656.0 --> 5660.639
of everything i make that's right that's

5658.719 --> 5663.76
why i ask people to basically

5660.639 --> 5665.1990000000005
donate to my paypal instead because

5663.76 --> 5668.400000000001
everything that's coming through

5665.199 --> 5670.719
google on my bank account yeah i have to

5668.4 --> 5672.4
report

5670.719 --> 5674.88
to the government and they'll just take

5672.4 --> 5677.5199999999995
it out because of my welfare situation

5674.88 --> 5679.92
yeah that's correct

5677.52 --> 5681.76
so only after the point where i would

5679.92 --> 5684.159
literally make more money than my

5681.76 --> 5685.84
welfare situation

5684.159 --> 5688.4
would it be effective for me to

5685.84 --> 5691.92
basically drop the welfare

5688.4 --> 5694.08
and then go around with what i make

5691.92 --> 5695.52
right but i'm not there yet i don't i

5694.08 --> 5698.4
can't

5695.52 --> 5700.080000000001
get enough stable income to get to that

5698.4 --> 5703.04
point just yet i might

5700.08 --> 5703.679
reach it who knows i might reach it my

5703.04 --> 5706.719
gti

5703.679 --> 5708.8
situation is pretty good it's just not

5706.719 --> 5711.119
very stable it's very difficult to

5708.8 --> 5713.1990000000005
actually transform all that crypto [ __ ]

5711.119 --> 5716.239
into money it's not as easy as we

5713.199 --> 5717.119
hope me and my dad but we might get

5716.239 --> 5719.199
there

5717.119 --> 5720.88
we might just get there at some point

5719.199 --> 5724.239
and then finally

5720.88 --> 5726.96
i'll be able to literally get off the

5724.239 --> 5730.0
welfare and and really start to

5726.96 --> 5730.0
build it as is

5730.08 --> 5733.76
for the first time in my life by the way

5732.4 --> 5737.04
all right

5733.76 --> 5742.96
it's better late than never but

5737.04 --> 5745.76
yeah it's not as easy as you would think

5742.96 --> 5748.159
and i'm yeah i'm it's really nice idea

5745.76 --> 5751.280000000001
that i could get off it and then just

5748.159 --> 5751.759999999999
make money and not that it's all for

5751.28 --> 5753.679
nothing

5751.76 --> 5755.52
because that was really demotivating in

5753.679 --> 5756.4800000000005
the last few years like oh i'm making

5755.52 --> 5758.96
money

5756.48 --> 5760.638999999999
and it's all gone it's like making

5758.96 --> 5761.44
nothing of it and because it makes you

5760.639 --> 5763.1990000000005
feel

5761.44 --> 5765.199
like you're literally working for

5763.199 --> 5766.96
nothing because like you're making extra

5765.199 --> 5768.839999999999
effort and you're literally getting

5766.96 --> 5770.0
nothing out of it it's really

5768.84 --> 5772.2390000000005
demotivating

5770.0 --> 5774.48
right it's not a very good system like

5772.239 --> 5774.48
that

5775.199 --> 5780.08
paypal is working you say julio pavin
