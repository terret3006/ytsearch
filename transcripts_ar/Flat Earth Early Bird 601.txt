the uk agm

152.8 --> 159.68
thanks for the update right so yeah i

156.319 --> 159.67999999999998
had a really weird night

160.4 --> 168.0
really weird in the sense that

164.239 --> 168.0
my system is getting

168.84 --> 174.879
weird i went to bed

171.44 --> 178.0
at 10 o'clock yeah

174.879 --> 179.78
that's i haven't been

178.0 --> 181.68
to bed that early

179.78 --> 185.12
[Music]

181.68 --> 186.48000000000002
for a long time but yeah it was also

185.12 --> 188.8
because i basically ran

186.48 --> 191.2
out of bread and i figured out that i

188.8 --> 193.44
couldn't have a late dinner

191.2 --> 195.599
and that kind of sucked so i just

193.44 --> 198.4
decided no i'll just go to sleep

195.599 --> 200.56
and in the morning i'm i'm usually

198.4 --> 203.519
usually not that hungry

200.56 --> 206.08
and then i'll just get bread the first

203.519 --> 207.92000000000002
opportunity

206.08 --> 209.519
and then yeah have lunch and all that

207.92 --> 212.879
and i did

209.519 --> 216.31900000000002
but yeah i did result in me getting up

212.879 --> 216.879
at four o'clock in the middle of the

216.319 --> 220.39999999999998
night

216.879 --> 223.2
because i was like yeah i pretty much

220.4 --> 223.92000000000002
slept six hours and after that i just

223.2 --> 226.48
started like

223.92 --> 228.95899999999997
getting all sweaty and [ __ ] and got

226.48 --> 228.959
restless

230.48 --> 235.84
and then i pretty much went to bed again

233.599 --> 235.84
at

239.519 --> 248.08
what is it i think like eight o'clock

244.319 --> 250.23899999999998
and then got up again at 11.

248.08 --> 255.84
so yeah i had a two-tier sleep very

250.239 --> 255.84
weird doesn't happen to me very often

261.12 --> 265.44
right also yeah i did actually

264.09 --> 268.56
[Music]

265.44 --> 272.0
write another two pages

268.56 --> 274.16
in my book so it's

272.0 --> 275.6
yeah it's i'm starting to get a grip on

274.16 --> 277.759
it and

275.6 --> 279.12
i'm wait yeah i'm literally now keeping

277.759 --> 283.28000000000003
the block

279.12 --> 286.96
note of the book next to my bed because

283.28 --> 286.96
that's how it happened yesterday as well

287.919 --> 292.71999999999997
just kept it there and then suddenly

290.08 --> 292.71999999999997
just started

292.96 --> 297.12
putting down the note so yeah there's

295.44 --> 300.71999999999997
now this

297.12 --> 304.96
whole page of barely readable [ __ ]

300.72 --> 308.88000000000005
and there's the other one and

304.96 --> 310.63899999999995
yeah it's getting movement i'm actually

308.88 --> 314.08
getting to the main

310.639 --> 316.08
portion so this seems to be just sort of

314.08 --> 318.96
a blabbering entry

316.08 --> 319.28
and as soon as i yeah start to really

318.96 --> 322.96
get

319.28 --> 324.32
more constructive design wise with the

322.96 --> 326.08
modeling and all that

324.32 --> 328.71999999999997
then the blabbering will probably at

326.08 --> 330.88
some point be replaced or grafted into

328.72 --> 333.199
the rest of what it's going to do

330.88 --> 336.24
but yeah i said it before you know this

333.199 --> 340.08000000000004
is not the first time that i've actually

336.24 --> 342.0
made a book since i did also make the d

340.08 --> 343.84
book even though there's not barely any

342.0 --> 345.12
real writing in it it's all technical

343.84 --> 348.56
description and

345.12 --> 350.16
micro story description

348.56 --> 352.24
you're like okay what is a typical

350.16 --> 353.91900000000004
example of this in this character so you

352.24 --> 354.40000000000003
got to get a really rough description

353.919 --> 357.44
then

354.4 --> 360.31899999999996
so yeah a lot of that

357.44 --> 362.24
so i know how it works and when you

360.319 --> 364.16
start a book that's the biggest problem

362.24 --> 366.40000000000003
at least it is always for me because

364.16 --> 368.16
before you start it you don't really

366.4 --> 370.31899999999996
know what you got yet you have all the

368.16 --> 373.68
ideas but they all

370.319 --> 375.28000000000003
all constantly overlap one another so i

373.68 --> 379.039
had to basically

375.28 --> 380.88
anchor myself by starting

379.039 --> 382.96
with a really standard approach

380.88 --> 384.24
basically as if somebody would ask me

382.96 --> 388.31899999999996
typical questions

384.24 --> 390.88
that they do about cosmogeny

388.319 --> 391.759
more yeah well they typically do not do

390.88 --> 394.8
that they use

391.759 --> 397.91900000000004
it's too complicated for most

394.8 --> 400.24
so i just started explaining getting

397.919 --> 402.96
into the details and then suddenly

400.24 --> 403.52
i got a grip then there is a structure

402.96 --> 405.68
in which

403.52 --> 406.56
all the ideas constantly overlapping one

405.68 --> 409.039
another

406.56 --> 410.639
start to get a grip in specific

409.039 --> 412.71999999999997
locations and like

410.639 --> 414.40000000000003
because of the structure you know where

412.72 --> 417.44000000000005
it's going to end up all of a sudden so

414.4 --> 420.479
it doesn't constantly get in your face

417.44 --> 422.4
it's yeah that's my description of how

420.479 --> 424.88
that works

422.4 --> 427.19899999999996
and i'm yeah i'm gonna do this i don't

424.88 --> 429.68
know if it's gonna be any good

427.199 --> 431.91900000000004
like i'm already basically watching it

429.68 --> 434.08
what i wrote down and i'm just like

431.919 --> 435.35999999999996
oh my god who the hell would want to

434.08 --> 437.68
read that

435.36 --> 440.319
that's disgusting it's totally

437.68 --> 443.199
irrational overreaction

440.319 --> 444.319
but it's just that my ego is getting in

443.199 --> 448.8
the way big time

444.319 --> 451.84000000000003
because there is this weird thing

448.8 --> 454.96000000000004
i haven't really even expanded up on it

451.84 --> 456.15999999999997
explained it too much has to do with my

454.96 --> 459.599
dark world vision

456.16 --> 464.319
and basically what i was back then

459.599 --> 468.0
because it had a massive fear

464.319 --> 470.08000000000004
of me during my life manifesting things

468.0 --> 473.759
especially things that are good

470.08 --> 478.08
that are like worthy and

473.759 --> 480.08000000000004
attention worthy so

478.08 --> 481.35999999999996
because it had learned through the

480.08 --> 483.52
darkness that

481.36 --> 484.8
if yeah if you stand out too much you'll

483.52 --> 489.19899999999996
get attacked

484.8 --> 492.879
so it was a very basically a coward's

489.199 --> 497.199
insight that is getting in my way

492.879 --> 500.319
and i'm literally fighting it

497.199 --> 503.039
psychologically because

500.319 --> 504.56
yeah as i've explained my vision reach

503.039 --> 507.759
into the future so it

504.56 --> 509.599
is get like whether it was a natural

507.759 --> 510.96000000000004
element of mind that i would always be

509.599 --> 515.4399999999999
struggling with

510.96 --> 519.12
or that it me in the past created it

515.44 --> 522.24
probably the first

519.12 --> 527.04
it doesn't really matter but the process

522.24 --> 530.0
has kind of personified that element

527.04 --> 531.8389999999999
to me to my life experience as being me

530.0 --> 534.08
in the past

531.839 --> 534.8800000000001
it's quite a nightmare in certain ways

534.08 --> 536.48
like that

534.88 --> 540.08
because it feels like i'm literally

536.48 --> 540.08
fighting myself from the past

540.88 --> 546.24
it's yeah right so i'm

544.48 --> 548.88
fighting against death pretty much

546.24 --> 552.32
probably the rest of my life

548.88 --> 555.76
i'm also realizing it and since i was

552.32 --> 559.12
always going to be like that

555.76 --> 560.48
because i've had these issues with

559.12 --> 563.2
myself getting in the way

560.48 --> 566.9590000000001
even when i was a very little kid before

563.2 --> 566.9590000000001
most of the garbage happened to me

567.36 --> 575.12
i'm just going to have to try to undo

571.36 --> 575.6
the personification spell that i kind of

575.12 --> 579.04
cast

575.6 --> 583.6800000000001
on myself on my dark side

579.04 --> 586.24
to undo that damage that i kind of

583.68 --> 588.88
recklessly performed out of sheer

586.24 --> 588.88
cowardice

589.6 --> 595.519
and like i didn't even know how to

592.72 --> 597.6
not do it when it eventually happened so

595.519 --> 602.079
i was kind of forced into it

597.6 --> 605.839
it's extremely extremely complicated to

602.079 --> 605.8389999999999
explain this

607.44 --> 612.72
right so yeah now everybody's all

609.6 --> 612.72
properly confused

614.399 --> 620.079
anyway i'm feeling it i'm feeling it

617.04 --> 622.959
it's like a counterweight

620.079 --> 622.959
and this is also

625.279 --> 628.56
it really is like there's always a

626.959 --> 631.1999999999999
counterbalance whatever i put out

628.56 --> 634.2399999999999
there's gonna be a price

631.2 --> 634.24
from the other side

634.399 --> 639.839
and now i'm basically dealing with it

637.44 --> 641.519
from a personal philosophical standpoint

639.839 --> 646.0
and that is like

641.519 --> 650.24
how much

646.0 --> 650.24
do i really love the glory

650.64 --> 654.48
versus just having a lot of time

654.88 --> 661.6
or can i even find a middle way through

659.36 --> 663.839
it and actually

661.6 --> 665.279
manage to figure out how to put out this

663.839 --> 675.839
glory and not

665.279 --> 675.8389999999999
get the darkness drag me down so much

684.0 --> 690.72
and whatever it is i am going to

687.44 --> 690.72
really do my best it's

691.519 --> 693.839
right

700.64 --> 708.48
it's so odd because in a way

703.92 --> 711.92
the way things had been arranged by my

708.48 --> 717.12
other self was with a complete

711.92 --> 720.24
lack of wisdom concerning how

717.12 --> 721.839
natural existence works i knew

720.24 --> 724.0790000000001
everything about the balance between

721.839 --> 728.0
light and darkness

724.079 --> 730.4799999999999
but i kind of falsely thought that

728.0 --> 732.88
myself in the future as a developing

730.48 --> 736.399
spirit would be able to

732.88 --> 737.76
keep out of it because that was my major

736.399 --> 740.88
advice to myself

737.76 --> 744.56
or advice i kind of

740.88 --> 747.6
pushed that because

744.56 --> 751.4399999999999
i was afraid even

747.6 --> 751.44
afraid of dying pretty much

751.76 --> 758.16
and right so

754.959 --> 761.5999999999999
now i philosophize sometimes about this

758.16 --> 765.279
situation like what would i have become

761.6 --> 768.5600000000001
if i hadn't done that somehow

765.279 --> 772.56
and i think that i have a nature to get

768.56 --> 776.56
quite excessive

772.56 --> 778.4799999999999
and i'm like holding back a lot at it

776.56 --> 781.1999999999999
but i do get excited like when i get

778.48 --> 782.639
angry i i tend to get quite excessive

781.2 --> 785.279
i don't know if you people have noticed

782.639 --> 788.639
that just about me that's

785.279 --> 790.56
a very explosive nature but in

788.639 --> 792.0
different ways like with love as well

790.56 --> 795.4399999999999
i'm excessive like

792.0 --> 796.56
but excessive means basically unbalanced

795.44 --> 799.2
it's too much

796.56 --> 801.5999999999999
i throw out too much i revel in it i

799.2 --> 803.519
want to lose myself in it too much it's

801.6 --> 806.399
almost like i use the moment to

803.519 --> 809.839
completely escape

806.399 --> 814.399
from the consciousness of my own burdens

809.839 --> 818.8000000000001
and if i hadn't

814.399 --> 818.8
been forced to personify

819.68 --> 826.2399999999999
fear of manifestation

823.04 --> 828.88
to myself then i probably would have

826.24 --> 833.12
been a lot more reckless

828.88 --> 835.76
i probably would have just really

833.12 --> 837.6
put myself out there at an earlier stage

835.76 --> 841.68
and probably would have got into

837.6 --> 843.9200000000001
a lot lot more trouble like really

841.68 --> 845.04
you know just imagine like what a

843.92 --> 848.24
character like me

845.04 --> 850.88
would be like if i had

848.24 --> 851.519
like the i'll just call it a pushy

850.88 --> 854.8
nature

851.519 --> 856.9590000000001
of name nathan thompson but not

854.8 --> 857.8389999999999
what else he did the rest of him you

856.959 --> 861.68
know because he

857.839 --> 863.839
is also has a great

861.68 --> 865.8389999999999
instinct for in the in the pressure

863.839 --> 868.839
knowing what he's doing

865.839 --> 870.8800000000001
and how to take control of the situation

868.839 --> 874.639
well

870.88 --> 877.199
i don't have it like that

874.639 --> 878.0790000000001
with me what happens is that the moment

877.199 --> 882.4799999999999
itself

878.079 --> 885.8389999999999
takes me to do that

882.48 --> 889.519
so i i rarely really have a

885.839 --> 890.5600000000001
real grip but if i get swept up in the

889.519 --> 894.079
moment

890.56 --> 896.959
and i basically expand then

894.079 --> 898.079
what i become gets that grip but it's

896.959 --> 901.5999999999999
not me

898.079 --> 905.12
really sounds complicated it's not

901.6 --> 906.9590000000001
durable so yeah i would have gotten into

905.12 --> 908.8
a lot of trouble if i hadn't done this

906.959 --> 910.6389999999999
and now yeah that's where the complete

908.8 --> 911.4399999999999
mind twist then sets in with me because

910.639 --> 914.5600000000001
it's like yeah

911.44 --> 916.0
yay i created this weird torture i was

914.56 --> 921.8389999999999
kind of forced into it

916.0 --> 923.92
but it's almost unbearable to imagine

921.839 --> 927.519
that it was probably for the better on

923.92 --> 931.279
the long run

927.519 --> 931.279
yeah mind twister

932.959 --> 937.199
anyway it's gonna be a thing a theme

936.32 --> 939.36
throughout my life

937.199 --> 941.04
manifesting things and while everybody's

939.36 --> 942.639
cheering me on probably when that

941.04 --> 943.5999999999999
happens when they see that it's like

942.639 --> 946.9590000000001
getting really

943.6 --> 948.16
heavy what's coming out they will be

946.959 --> 951.279
like yay

948.16 --> 952.7199999999999
while i will probably and don't even

951.279 --> 957.68
feel guilty

952.72 --> 962.88
about this i will be probably in pain

957.68 --> 962.88
like because

963.519 --> 967.04
of what my spirit does because of the

965.92 --> 969.279
fear

967.04 --> 973.12
from the other side from me in the past

969.279 --> 975.4399999999999
of me manifesting and getting

973.12 --> 975.44
seen

977.36 --> 983.839
people that will move to me and try to

979.759 --> 983.839
seduce me try to alter me

984.24 --> 988.399
to try to rearrange me to fit in their

987.44 --> 990.8000000000001
boxes

988.399 --> 992.56
see because that is what happens when

990.8 --> 995.04
you really manifest

992.56 --> 997.199
when you you create something truly

995.04 --> 999.12
glorious that touches everyone not just

997.199 --> 1002.0
something that is incredible

999.12 --> 1003.279
you know my cosmogeny [ __ ] it's kind of

1002.0 --> 1007.04
incredible

1003.279 --> 1009.519
but people

1007.04 --> 1010.639
also like it doesn't really stick too

1009.519 --> 1013.68
much because it is

1010.639 --> 1017.44
incredible it's really a lot

1013.68 --> 1022.2399999999999
to take in and it doesn't

1017.44 --> 1023.839
touch a universal level that much it's

1022.24 --> 1027.36
almost like i on purpose

1023.839 --> 1028.16
avoided that for before mentioned

1027.36 --> 1030.8799999999999
reasons

1028.16 --> 1033.919
because here's the thing i don't like

1030.88 --> 1033.919
feeling tortured

1036.079 --> 1042.799
but hey on the same time i the

1040.559 --> 1044.799
the idea that i would basically be

1042.799 --> 1047.9189999999999
sitting and just blabbering

1044.799 --> 1051.08
hanging on the side for 20 years

1047.919 --> 1054.5590000000002
not really having done something is just

1051.08 --> 1057.039
mind-blowingly shameful to me

1054.559 --> 1057.039
also

1058.72 --> 1063.3600000000001
so which one is it going to be

1061.36 --> 1068.559
mind-blowing shame

1063.36 --> 1068.559
or a life of torture and glory

1075.039 --> 1081.84
i'm trying to find the middle way guys

1086.64 --> 1091.039
all right yeah but that that's right agm

1089.28 --> 1095.84
but that's the thing about

1091.039 --> 1095.84
glory is that it

1096.16 --> 1100.64
if it's really a lot then people can't

1099.039 --> 1102.24
handle it and then they'll try to

1100.64 --> 1105.5200000000002
degrade it just to not

1102.24 --> 1107.679
be so enthralled by it

1105.52 --> 1109.76
and distracted from what they the

1107.679 --> 1112.0800000000002
specific framework that they are trying

1109.76 --> 1113.84
to maintain for control money power all

1112.08 --> 1116.96
that

1113.84 --> 1117.6
so they will always try to like if

1116.96 --> 1119.44
something

1117.6 --> 1121.6
really stands out shining in all

1119.44 --> 1122.48
directions they will try to box it in

1121.6 --> 1126.48
somehow

1122.48 --> 1128.799
it happens always it's one of the things

1126.48 --> 1128.799
that i

1130.48 --> 1134.24
that when i started to really figure

1132.64 --> 1138.7990000000002
this out when i was young

1134.24 --> 1138.799
i thought it was absolutely unacceptable

1139.12 --> 1144.32
it it's one of the things that kind of

1141.84 --> 1144.32
made me

1145.2 --> 1150.16
what i first first thought was rebel

1147.6 --> 1153.28
against god but it's

1150.16 --> 1153.28
complicated like that

1154.559 --> 1161.039
it's like i thought it's like no that

1157.84 --> 1161.52
why can't things just that are glorious

1161.039 --> 1164.799
just

1161.52 --> 1167.28
be and stay why

1164.799 --> 1169.76
does everything get grabbled pretty much

1167.28 --> 1173.2
everything

1169.76 --> 1177.2
never sit sat on that and let that

1173.2 --> 1177.6000000000001
slap me in the face on a continual basis

1177.2 --> 1180.48
for

1177.6 --> 1180.48
decades now

1181.84 --> 1185.9189999999999
and then i'm figuring out also more by

1184.16 --> 1192.16
what i see other people doing there

1185.919 --> 1195.76
learning curves and all that that

1192.16 --> 1198.88
there's ways to deal with it as long

1195.76 --> 1201.6
as you can first off accept that

1198.88 --> 1202.24
everything shall be grappled there is no

1201.6 --> 1204.32
escape

1202.24 --> 1205.84
if it is glorious it shall be grabble

1204.32 --> 1209.2
there is no escape

1205.84 --> 1212.08
once you accept that then you can learn

1209.2 --> 1212.72
to figure out how that works how they

1212.08 --> 1214.48
proceed

1212.72 --> 1215.919
because it is usually from a pretty

1214.48 --> 1219.6
basic

1215.919 --> 1221.8400000000001
a more basic approach than

1219.6 --> 1223.4399999999998
the vantage point of the creation that

1221.84 --> 1226.6399999999999
is so glorious

1223.44 --> 1229.52
basically that whatever the product or

1226.64 --> 1232.72
the story or whatever it is the idea

1229.52 --> 1234.0
music something everything will be

1232.72 --> 1238.08
grappled but if you know

1234.0 --> 1242.4
how it will be rebelled then

1238.08 --> 1243.6789999999999
you can create it in a way that it is

1242.4 --> 1247.3600000000001
kind of

1243.679 --> 1250.159
immune to it that however it is going to

1247.36 --> 1252.6399999999999
be grappled

1250.159 --> 1253.2800000000002
it will always feel like a stolen

1252.64 --> 1256.4
product

1253.28 --> 1259.12
and can't really replace it

1256.4 --> 1263.8400000000001
so that it actually remains untouched

1259.12 --> 1263.84
despite being gravel

1264.0 --> 1267.919
right and the funny thing is is that

1266.48 --> 1271.039
cosmogeny is

1267.919 --> 1272.0
very good example of this nobody's

1271.039 --> 1275.679
grappling it

1272.0 --> 1278.96
nobody you know there's the diskers

1275.679 --> 1282.96
they hold on to a disk

1278.96 --> 1286.159
it's not grappling it's really just

1282.96 --> 1289.52
creating another world example icon

1286.159 --> 1292.0800000000002
and using that as a vantage point to

1289.52 --> 1294.24
replace the image in the mind that keeps

1292.08 --> 1297.28
everybody on the globe

1294.24 --> 1301.039
it's a vantage point but

1297.28 --> 1303.36
it's not really getting grappled

1301.039 --> 1306.08
if the only way it's getting gravel is

1303.36 --> 1306.799
by making people associate try to draw

1306.08 --> 1309.36
in

1306.799 --> 1311.12
maybe in fights and then draw them away

1309.36 --> 1313.84
from flat earth

1311.12 --> 1315.76
or onto other types of approaches like

1313.84 --> 1317.039
let's not call it flat earth and before

1315.76 --> 1319.52
you know it

1317.039 --> 1320.96
you forgot you ever talked about it

1319.52 --> 1325.039
that's a way to grable it

1320.96 --> 1327.039
but you can't really replace it

1325.039 --> 1328.64
you can't actually grabble it and then

1327.039 --> 1330.48
take that place they can't do that

1328.64 --> 1332.64
because of the way the world is arranged

1330.48 --> 1335.6
and because of the decision

1332.64 --> 1337.679
of the foundational stories they can't

1335.6 --> 1340.1589999999999
do it so

1337.679 --> 1342.159
from that view i'm kind of safe i don't

1340.159 --> 1344.5590000000002
feel like everything i'm making here

1342.159 --> 1345.679
is going to be stolen maybe by science

1344.559 --> 1348.8799999999999
fiction writers

1345.679 --> 1349.8400000000001
i reconciled with that that is going to

1348.88 --> 1351.7600000000002
happen

1349.84 --> 1353.28
and at the same time i realized that

1351.76 --> 1356.64
even if i'll never get

1353.28 --> 1357.44
any credit for my conceptions by other

1356.64 --> 1359.919
people

1357.44 --> 1361.3600000000001
by other writers why movie makers

1359.919 --> 1364.5590000000002
whatever

1361.36 --> 1368.0
if they are going to use certain aspects

1364.559 --> 1370.0
of what i figured out i will see it

1368.0 --> 1371.919
and other people that will know my work

1370.0 --> 1372.32
will also see it and it won't even

1371.919 --> 1375.6000000000001
matter

1372.32 --> 1380.24
if i get credit for it or not

1375.6 --> 1382.7199999999998
and that's the way it has to be

1380.24 --> 1382.72
for me

1384.08 --> 1388.559
and i hope i'll get credit but at the

1386.0 --> 1390.88
same time i would not be surprised if i

1388.559 --> 1390.8799999999999
wouldn't

1392.82 --> 1397.6
[Music]

1395.919 --> 1399.2
flat earth society pushes the

1397.6 --> 1401.28
accelerated

1399.2 --> 1402.88
abort flat disk yeah but guns have never

1401.28 --> 1406.48
run the flatter society

1402.88 --> 1410.0
nobody does anything with that

1406.48 --> 1410.0
they're a mock organization

1411.2 --> 1416.0800000000002
that's not the and they were there for a

1414.0 --> 1419.28
long time

1416.08 --> 1422.48
to basically reaffirm their

1419.28 --> 1423.76
their programmed ridicule towards flat

1422.48 --> 1425.6
earth

1423.76 --> 1427.76
they were always there so that people

1425.6 --> 1430.799
that really thought like but

1427.76 --> 1431.679
why can't we just try to think in a

1430.799 --> 1434.96
different way

1431.679 --> 1436.799
like more cosmogonical flexible people

1434.96 --> 1438.96
and then the flatter society would just

1436.799 --> 1442.6399999999999
ruin that

1438.96 --> 1446.08
that's what they were for but

1442.64 --> 1448.24
they are not taking over do you realize

1446.08 --> 1451.76
that they are not

1448.24 --> 1455.2
taking control of flat earth

1451.76 --> 1456.0
like they can't it just seems they can't

1455.2 --> 1459.3600000000001
because of the

1456.0 --> 1460.159
before mentioned reasons their

1459.36 --> 1463.279
foundation

1460.159 --> 1465.1200000000001
rests upon a very specific storyline

1463.279 --> 1467.039
and that includes the globe so they

1465.12 --> 1469.52
literally can't go there

1467.039 --> 1469.52
without

1470.08 --> 1477.9189999999999
rearranging everything everything

1474.72 --> 1479.279
and that once you engage in that that

1477.919 --> 1482.48
will dispel

1479.279 --> 1486.72
everything that will completely dispel

1482.48 --> 1490.88
all programming and people will rebel

1486.72 --> 1492.4
or go insane if that happens

1490.88 --> 1494.7990000000002
so that is why i think it's not

1492.4 --> 1497.76
happening like this

1494.799 --> 1499.12
my flat earth is not literally being

1497.76 --> 1501.76
caught

1499.12 --> 1503.76
yeah rip yeah they're coming in and

1501.76 --> 1505.44
taking over no they're not

1503.76 --> 1507.52
they're constantly trying to just

1505.44 --> 1510.4
discourage people from going here

1507.52 --> 1510.799
and luring back to the globe but they're

1510.4 --> 1514.96
not

1510.799 --> 1518.1589999999999
taking it over

1514.96 --> 1519.919
they put they try to manipulate people

1518.159 --> 1520.64
in the scene to kind of do certain

1519.919 --> 1523.679
things

1520.64 --> 1524.159
but it's rather like yeah trying to lure

1523.679 --> 1526.799
people

1524.159 --> 1528.0
in flat earth to poison their well to

1526.799 --> 1531.2
ruin it for whatever

1528.0 --> 1534.72
reason scam money thingies

1531.2 --> 1537.2
lollipops fancy pants but they're not

1534.72 --> 1539.3600000000001
coming in and taking control like

1537.2 --> 1542.96
building the foundation

1539.36 --> 1544.4799999999998
to become the future do you see

1542.96 --> 1546.64
because that is how it works that's how

1544.48 --> 1548.32
controllers really work if something is

1546.64 --> 1549.76
going to be the future then they will

1548.32 --> 1553.6789999999999
get in

1549.76 --> 1555.52
and they will then take control and do

1553.679 --> 1557.8400000000001
it right

1555.52 --> 1559.36
because in the building phase of course

1557.84 --> 1560.9599999999998
you have to do it right you have to be

1559.36 --> 1563.6
the perfect example

1560.96 --> 1565.279
and then once you get control then they

1563.6 --> 1568.559
can drop the veil

1565.279 --> 1571.84
of goodness and just get too controlling

1568.559 --> 1571.84
and that's how they always work

1572.159 --> 1574.5590000000002
all right

1577.84 --> 1588.799
hey stazmaretz yes i saw your comments

1585.2 --> 1590.559
uh right well i think i already

1588.799 --> 1594.1589999999999
addressed your question

1590.559 --> 1594.1589999999999
she did

1594.24 --> 1600.48
really yeah you did see it so

1597.76 --> 1613.84
uh yeah i haven't really read the chat

1600.48 --> 1613.84
so far

1618.159 --> 1621.919
all right yeah oh by the way robin

1620.32 --> 1626.1589999999999
stanley

1621.919 --> 1628.7990000000002
yeah i know you get me you're very sharp

1626.159 --> 1630.3200000000002
you can see me i know so you also

1628.799 --> 1633.279
understand that the whole concept of

1630.32 --> 1635.76
torture and glory

1633.279 --> 1637.36
that's been with me all my life and it's

1635.76 --> 1640.1589999999999
one of the things even that

1637.36 --> 1642.799
made baldur's gate the game but

1640.159 --> 1645.279
especially the music

1642.799 --> 1645.84
appeal to me because that is the theme

1645.279 --> 1648.72
it's like

1645.84 --> 1649.52
this main character whether you realize

1648.72 --> 1651.84
it or not

1649.52 --> 1653.44
they experience a lot of pain and grief

1651.84 --> 1656.559
and they have nightmares

1653.44 --> 1657.52
very painful nightmares and [ __ ] and

1656.559 --> 1660.8799999999999
they're basically

1657.52 --> 1664.0
being well you could say invaded by

1660.88 --> 1667.679
extra dimensional spirit of a god of

1664.0 --> 1670.399
the god of death no less and it's

1667.679 --> 1672.72
the entire game is basically resting on

1670.399 --> 1674.559
the psychological balance of how

1672.72 --> 1676.48
the main character which is you and you

1674.559 --> 1676.799
can make your character however you like

1676.48 --> 1680.0
but

1676.799 --> 1683.84
that part is always there it's up to you

1680.0 --> 1683.84
to figure it out it's almost like

1683.919 --> 1691.6000000000001
lord of the rings frodo's

1687.36 --> 1694.1589999999999
journey except from a more powerful

1691.6 --> 1695.039
in control standpoint a warrior wizard

1694.159 --> 1698.0800000000002
whatever

1695.039 --> 1699.919
you want to be barbarian more like conan

1698.08 --> 1701.52
the barbarian

1699.919 --> 1704.24
you know conan the barbarian the

1701.52 --> 1707.039
original movie

1704.24 --> 1707.6
is very much in the same pattern also

1707.039 --> 1710.559
it's

1707.6 --> 1710.9599999999998
torturous painful background and they

1710.559 --> 1714.08
grow

1710.96 --> 1718.08
it's it's the adventurous journey

1714.08 --> 1721.52
from a slave or a nitwit

1718.08 --> 1723.52
to a to a king

1721.52 --> 1725.12
and in this case with baldur's gate to a

1723.52 --> 1727.36
literal god

1725.12 --> 1730.08
or you could also choose not to embrace

1727.36 --> 1733.4399999999998
that to let it fade

1730.08 --> 1734.8799999999999
and pass on to another in the in the

1733.44 --> 1738.0800000000002
pantheon there

1734.88 --> 1742.88
but anyway yeah intense [ __ ] and this

1738.08 --> 1742.8799999999999
is like this is a lot with me

1746.88 --> 1751.44
originally that conception even kind of

1750.399 --> 1753.6
motivated me

1751.44 --> 1756.3200000000002
in a backdrop idea that would make it

1753.6 --> 1756.32
more bearable

1759.679 --> 1763.2
sounds maybe a little dramatic

1764.84 --> 1767.9189999999999
anyway

1766.48 --> 1771.44
yeah i've been listening back to that

1767.919 --> 1774.159
music i shared some with robin stanley

1771.44 --> 1774.799
probably the most amazing song in the

1774.159 --> 1779.0390000000002
entire

1774.799 --> 1782.6399999999999
genre like

1779.039 --> 1783.919
it's that song like almost makes me cry

1782.64 --> 1787.3600000000001
it's so beautiful

1783.919 --> 1788.64
and deep but a lot of the songs in that

1787.36 --> 1790.799
entire thing are

1788.64 --> 1793.6000000000001
like just listening back to it i was

1790.799 --> 1797.6
like wow man

1793.6 --> 1800.7199999999998
it is such an unbelievable masterpiece

1797.6 --> 1804.7199999999998
it is probably

1800.72 --> 1807.76
one of the best musical compositions

1804.72 --> 1810.799
ever made in the modern time

1807.76 --> 1813.84
even though it is definitely

1810.799 --> 1817.2
grafted it is like a music

1813.84 --> 1817.4399999999998
uh movie music and they grafted in a lot

1817.2 --> 1820.0
of

1817.44 --> 1821.52
good things and then really rearranged

1820.0 --> 1824.08
them to bypass

1821.52 --> 1825.679
its seeming copy but there's like all

1824.08 --> 1828.1589999999999
kinds of good

1825.679 --> 1829.3600000000001
really detailed feel on a classical

1828.159 --> 1831.3600000000001
style

1829.36 --> 1833.279
from different movies that you might

1831.36 --> 1834.6399999999999
recognize

1833.279 --> 1836.48
and one of the first things that comes

1834.64 --> 1838.159
up with baldur's guide is i was talking

1836.48 --> 1840.88
about the baldur's gate music is from

1838.159 --> 1844.0
conan the barbarian

1840.88 --> 1846.48
seems they're they definitely listened

1844.0 --> 1848.64
and watched that movie and they should

1846.48 --> 1851.52
it's one of the best movies

1848.64 --> 1852.0800000000002
that i've ever seen and i had a weird

1851.52 --> 1856.48
little

1852.08 --> 1856.48
little detailed realization that maybe

1858.159 --> 1863.7600000000002
this may sound kind of weird

1861.36 --> 1866.4799999999998
but yeah there's a lot of interesting

1863.76 --> 1870.1589999999999
thing about conan and the barbarian

1866.48 --> 1874.64
for example it kind of suggests

1870.159 --> 1876.88
that it the country they're at is

1874.64 --> 1876.88
uh

1877.76 --> 1884.48
arbor they they call it abra

1881.36 --> 1884.8799999999999
or arbora and it is kind of the remember

1884.48 --> 1886.72
the

1884.88 --> 1889.0390000000002
island with the four rivers in the north

1886.72 --> 1890.84
supposedly they're kind of hinting like

1889.039 --> 1893.6
it's that and that it is

1890.84 --> 1897.12
extremely ancient

1893.6 --> 1898.48
like maybe even pre-babylonian or during

1897.12 --> 1901.039
that

1898.48 --> 1902.3990000000001
away from the area of babylon itself

1901.039 --> 1904.1589999999999
during that age

1902.399 --> 1905.6
and another thing that i thought of is

1904.159 --> 1909.0390000000002
that

1905.6 --> 1914.08
in a way how

1909.039 --> 1914.08
things go it almost seems like it's

1914.24 --> 1916.48
like

1919.76 --> 1922.8799999999999
you know the the whole thing about

1921.919 --> 1926.48
genghis khan

1922.88 --> 1929.3600000000001
right the way they just uh the way

1926.48 --> 1930.88
they describe him in history and big

1929.36 --> 1932.7199999999998
bear has addressed this

1930.88 --> 1934.0
with tartaria and it's like very

1932.72 --> 1937.1200000000001
unlikely the way

1934.0 --> 1940.96
they supposed that was

1937.12 --> 1942.8799999999999
i think that conan the barbarian

1940.96 --> 1944.559
and he's in the movie he'd never really

1942.88 --> 1945.7600000000002
guessed there but he said he would be

1944.559 --> 1948.24
king

1945.76 --> 1950.96
that he might have been one of the kings

1948.24 --> 1954.559
of tartaria

1950.96 --> 1956.88
that it's actually a lost story

1954.559 --> 1959.44
that they secretly worked into a

1956.88 --> 1963.919
fictional thing and

1959.44 --> 1963.919
i think that got this feel from it

1966.64 --> 1973.44
although tartaria would be

1970.159 --> 1975.8400000000001
late in a later period

1973.44 --> 1977.3600000000001
but maybe he was one of the original

1975.84 --> 1980.6399999999999
kings

1977.36 --> 1983.039
in a much in an older time that led up

1980.64 --> 1985.2
to the empire of tartaria before it was

1983.039 --> 1987.76
completely unrouted

1985.2 --> 1990.24
so that is this lost ancient history

1987.76 --> 1993.12
that's just never gonna reappear

1990.24 --> 1994.64
from the mainstream into history so they

1993.12 --> 1998.8799999999999
made this

1994.64 --> 2002.96
incredible movie maybe this is me

1998.88 --> 2002.96
looking too much into it maybe

2005.039 --> 2008.1589999999999
maybe i'm getting kind of drunk on all

2007.12 --> 2011.4399999999998
the glory of

2008.159 --> 2011.44
just watching

2012.08 --> 2016.559
those great movies and listening to that

2015.36 --> 2020.7199999999998
great music but

2016.559 --> 2023.36
it was a thought i don't know

2020.72 --> 2023.3600000000001
could be off

2028.6 --> 2033.6789999999999
[Music]

2030.84 --> 2037.039
yeah i think you're right tess moretz i

2033.679 --> 2037.039
think it was a comic book

2040.72 --> 2043.919
all right but that shouldn't detract you

2043.2 --> 2047.8400000000001
know

2043.919 --> 2047.8400000000001
from the value of it

2063.839 --> 2075.839
zach hemley

2080.159 --> 2089.839
what stones comment what what what

2084.56 --> 2089.839
are you talking about

2096.72 --> 2105.2799999999997
man yeah also by the way

2100.88 --> 2109.119
i feel in a way kind of a grief

2105.28 --> 2113.119
that music isn't free

2109.119 --> 2116.32
you know i am a like

2113.119 --> 2118.079
a music fine taster i really love really

2116.32 --> 2122.8
good music

2118.079 --> 2124.8
it's really a lot and

2122.8 --> 2126.48
there's been so many times like even on

2124.8 --> 2128.48
my show where i just thought like wow

2126.48 --> 2130.48
what if i could take this song

2128.48 --> 2132.64
or that song depending on the mood and

2130.48 --> 2136.4
just start up with that

2132.64 --> 2136.4
no i can't do that

2137.04 --> 2140.32
and yeah most people that think like

2139.92 --> 2143.28
that

2140.32 --> 2144.76
they would then go like okay well i'll

2143.28 --> 2146.6400000000003
just find a

2144.76 --> 2148.0
non-copyrighted song that kind of

2146.64 --> 2151.839
reminds me about it and

2148.0 --> 2155.44
it'll be good enough or they have a

2151.839 --> 2160.16
a band do a cover for it like that

2155.44 --> 2163.359
right well with this the music that i

2160.16 --> 2166.48
that i like that wouldn't suffice

2163.359 --> 2169.44
that would basically ruin it for me and

2166.48 --> 2173.839
yeah so i have a lot of grief about the

2169.44 --> 2173.839
whole copyright nonsense

2177.04 --> 2181.119
but then again you know realizing also

2179.839 --> 2185.2
how the world works

2181.119 --> 2187.599
right now and the amount of crazy people

2185.2 --> 2189.7599999999998
out there yeah if copyrights would kind

2187.599 --> 2192.48
of completely drop

2189.76 --> 2193.92
with that then yeah people would trash

2192.48 --> 2197.04
everything

2193.92 --> 2199.6800000000003
they would trash it like pop music

2197.04 --> 2200.079
trashes the old music there constantly

2199.68 --> 2203.68
now

2200.079 --> 2206.7200000000003
reproducing with newer artists

2203.68 --> 2209.9199999999996
and worse much worse and it you would be

2206.72 --> 2212.8799999999997
overwhelmed with how badly they raped

2209.92 --> 2215.92
everything that's ever been beautiful

2212.88 --> 2219.28
yes so at that

2215.92 --> 2223.359
i'm kind of like okay fine fine i'll

2219.28 --> 2223.3590000000004
just have to enjoy the music of my own

2226.64 --> 2231.52
it would be fantastic if at one point i

2229.2 --> 2231.52
could just

2233.2 --> 2241.359
all right music is for worship

2236.88 --> 2256.88
the what no not necessarily

2241.359 --> 2260.0
good servant

2256.88 --> 2261.52
nope can't do that stash moretz because

2260.0 --> 2264.8
i will get

2261.52 --> 2266.96
like uh my monetization will be claimed

2264.8 --> 2268.0
and probably if i keep on doing it yeah

2266.96 --> 2270.16
then it won't get in

2268.0 --> 2271.2
that will probably be demonetized or get

2270.16 --> 2275.68
copyright strike

2271.2 --> 2275.68
struck for real so

2280.48 --> 2285.839
uh what guns of naferon i don't know who

2282.8 --> 2285.8390000000004
that is

2287.68 --> 2294.56
could you perhaps contact me on skype

2291.28 --> 2298.079
and put the name in there

2294.56 --> 2301.7599999999998
because i don't know these people i

2298.079 --> 2304.4
not gonna look all that up right now

2301.76 --> 2313.8390000000004
like i need my time if i'm going to

2304.4 --> 2313.839
analyze new music

2324.24 --> 2330.8799999999997
okay okay interesting

2327.839 --> 2334.0
well look there is

2330.88 --> 2335.04
you know with movie music the weird

2334.0 --> 2337.52
thing is

2335.04 --> 2340.079
the music from baldur's gate is not

2337.52 --> 2343.119
really proper movie music

2340.079 --> 2344.88
you know why because it's too good it's

2343.119 --> 2348.0
too

2344.88 --> 2355.839
it's almost like a

2348.0 --> 2355.839
a sound painting

2356.24 --> 2362.0
it's too upfront uh you know how there's

2359.359 --> 2362.0
like uh

2362.88 --> 2367.839
spoken books radio play like that

2366.48 --> 2369.839
where there's just things being

2367.839 --> 2373.359
described well this music

2369.839 --> 2376.24
kind of does that completely by itself

2373.359 --> 2376.96
if you accompany it with just a couple

2376.24 --> 2380.0
of

2376.96 --> 2382.079
drawings or paintings

2380.0 --> 2384.0
which are typically part of the game

2382.079 --> 2385.6800000000003
where yeah you enter the region it'll

2384.0 --> 2386.64
have a certain look and then the music

2385.68 --> 2388.7999999999997
starts

2386.64 --> 2391.1189999999997
that's what it was designed for it's not

2388.8 --> 2394.32
proper

2391.119 --> 2394.8
movie music because in a movie it would

2394.32 --> 2398.1600000000003
be

2394.8 --> 2398.1600000000003
way too distracting

2400.88 --> 2407.28
yeah i'm pretty sure of this

2403.92 --> 2410.7200000000003
the funny thing is i even kind of

2407.28 --> 2414.4
it works like this in a way when you

2410.72 --> 2416.16
are gaming because yeah hey we're gamers

2414.4 --> 2418.0
you know dnd and all that i'm a game

2416.16 --> 2420.8799999999997
master somebody has a

2418.0 --> 2422.64
laptop you just play the music files

2420.88 --> 2424.6400000000003
just like that as background music well

2422.64 --> 2428.16
with baldur's gate it's awesome

2424.64 --> 2428.16
but if it's if you put it on

2428.319 --> 2432.24
relatively loud it's gonna really

2430.72 --> 2435.359
distract

2432.24 --> 2438.3999999999996
from complex conversation scenes

2435.359 --> 2440.96
that we are playing out interactively so

2438.4 --> 2443.92
that's like weird how that works

2440.96 --> 2444.56
but i like it i like that music i like

2443.92 --> 2446.8
that it is

2444.56 --> 2449.2799999999997
that it takes up so much of my attention

2446.8 --> 2452.0
it's something i really like about it

2449.28 --> 2453.28
it gets really close to me it's almost

2452.0 --> 2456.88
like it's

2453.28 --> 2459.2000000000003
a living thing or a person it's not

2456.88 --> 2459.2000000000003
though

2460.72 --> 2468.319
and yeah with good movie music the music

2464.0 --> 2470.56
takes a second place and also

2468.319 --> 2472.16
yeah in a movie timing with music is

2470.56 --> 2475.359
absolutely everything

2472.16 --> 2477.5989999999997
so yeah music certain sounds from the

2475.359 --> 2481.2
music can be used to

2477.599 --> 2484.1600000000003
powerfully uh accentuate a moment

2481.2 --> 2485.2
or an act in a movie you know that

2484.16 --> 2486.7999999999997
really doesn't happen

2485.2 --> 2488.56
in the game either it just starts

2486.8 --> 2490.2400000000002
playing

2488.56 --> 2491.599
although yeah there's switches of course

2490.24 --> 2495.2799999999997
hey there's combat then

2491.599 --> 2498.079
the combat music starts up

2495.28 --> 2498.8
but that's as far as it goes there's no

2498.079 --> 2502.2400000000002
real

2498.8 --> 2504.1600000000003
literal act timing thing going on

2502.24 --> 2505.2799999999997
in there at all but yeah that's just how

2504.16 --> 2508.24
it was designed

2505.28 --> 2510.5600000000004
anyway i'm fascinated i always have been

2508.24 --> 2514.64
fascinated with baldur's gate

2510.56 --> 2522.0789999999997
you know the game especially number two

2514.64 --> 2526.48
but and because of the music

2522.079 --> 2529.04
but it is really all about the music

2526.48 --> 2530.319
and i'm just like listening back to it

2529.04 --> 2533.68
and then thinking about well

2530.319 --> 2536.64
how did he make that how does it work

2533.68 --> 2540.0
and i got some ideas about it it's just

2536.64 --> 2541.92
that i'm not really a composer

2540.0 --> 2544.24
never really even tried it i watched my

2541.92 --> 2546.2400000000002
mother do it

2544.24 --> 2547.9199999999996
but she was like really an original

2546.24 --> 2551.04
composer she would really make

2547.92 --> 2553.599
things from scratch figure out new

2551.04 --> 2555.119
patterns which is quite unique and hey

2553.599 --> 2558.1600000000003
if you listen to my

2555.119 --> 2560.1600000000003
my mother's music which is a file that i

2558.16 --> 2561.68
uploaded in a special playlist

2560.16 --> 2564.72
here on this youtube channel you would

2561.68 --> 2565.1189999999997
hear that that yes she does borrow

2564.72 --> 2567.7599999999998
things

2565.119 --> 2570.079
but she also has definitely created

2567.76 --> 2572.1600000000003
pretty unique things

2570.079 --> 2573.44
and that was part of her pride too

2572.16 --> 2577.52
because she was

2573.44 --> 2578.88
a composer and a teacher

2577.52 --> 2580.72
and when you compose something you're

2578.88 --> 2582.96
not just gonna graph together a lot of

2580.72 --> 2582.9599999999996
[ __ ]

2590.16 --> 2593.5989999999997
or at least you're gonna try to make

2592.4 --> 2597.04
something original

2593.599 --> 2597.04
if you think you can do it

2604.839 --> 2607.839
anyway

2608.64 --> 2623.7599999999998
but right so i've been thinking

2620.16 --> 2628.0789999999997
right there is there seems to be a block

2623.76 --> 2631.28
blockage on the legendary music

2628.079 --> 2635.8390000000004
of the baldur's gate series because

2631.28 --> 2635.8390000000004
even there is like there uh

2636.4 --> 2642.48
what did they call it it was kind of

2638.24 --> 2642.4799999999996
remade no not literally they basically

2644.76 --> 2649.119
re-re-tinkered the game

2646.56 --> 2651.44
to get certain errors out of the way

2649.119 --> 2652.8
have updates for the interface to make

2651.44 --> 2656.0
it more smoothly but keep

2652.8 --> 2659.04
the entire story of the game the same

2656.0 --> 2660.64
and add on some new regions that they

2659.04 --> 2662.16
made

2660.64 --> 2664.0
this is something that has happened like

2662.16 --> 2665.839
in the recent 10 years they did this

2664.0 --> 2667.44
with a lot of these games and i'm glad

2665.839 --> 2668.96
about it because the older games were

2667.44 --> 2670.319
kind of broken you couldn't really

2668.96 --> 2672.56
properly play them

2670.319 --> 2675.359
like very clumsy interface and [ __ ]

2672.56 --> 2678.72
compared to now you know 90s interface

2675.359 --> 2679.44
terrible but they redid it very happy

2678.72 --> 2681.2
those

2679.44 --> 2682.64
games i have installed on my desktop

2681.2 --> 2685.5989999999997
even

2682.64 --> 2686.16
but i noticed something in the playlist

2685.599 --> 2688.8
and that is

2686.16 --> 2691.1189999999997
wow there's just the old polish gate 2

2688.8 --> 2693.599
music and it's all just fantastic and

2691.119 --> 2695.52
definitely made by the same individual

2693.599 --> 2698.1600000000003
who's a master

2695.52 --> 2699.119
in my opinion and then there were the

2698.16 --> 2702.319
songs

2699.119 --> 2702.319
of the new levels

2702.64 --> 2711.2799999999997
and it was [ __ ] sorry

2707.76 --> 2714.8
not the maker of the music's fault

2711.28 --> 2715.2000000000003
i think he got available the studio the

2714.8 --> 2718.7200000000003
sound

2715.2 --> 2719.52
studio system that the original maker

2718.72 --> 2721.52
used

2719.52 --> 2723.599
and he was probably just completely

2721.52 --> 2724.24
overwhelmed by what you can actually do

2723.599 --> 2728.4
with it

2724.24 --> 2731.1189999999997
so he focused mainly on just applying

2728.4 --> 2733.599
movie theatrical effects with the sound

2731.119 --> 2736.96
and it's kind of interesting atmospheric

2733.599 --> 2741.3590000000004
there was no composition had

2736.96 --> 2744.0
no theme no i'd no structure in that

2741.359 --> 2745.52
and so it felt kind of like a waste and

2744.0 --> 2747.359
even though on the surface it

2745.52 --> 2748.88
seemed like oh that's pretty decent when

2747.359 --> 2750.64
you don't really listen to it it's a

2748.88 --> 2752.319
good background sound

2750.64 --> 2753.839
but when you compare it to the rest of

2752.319 --> 2755.599
the music from published gate it was

2753.839 --> 2758.7999999999997
just [ __ ]

2755.599 --> 2759.28
now that doesn't mean that i'm gonna say

2758.8 --> 2762.079
that

2759.28 --> 2764.1600000000003
like that person has to be fired or [ __ ]

2762.079 --> 2767.04
i'm just saying he probably just didn't

2764.16 --> 2767.04
have enough time

2767.119 --> 2770.56
to figure out a composition or they

2768.8 --> 2772.6400000000003
didn't get a composer they just

2770.56 --> 2774.16
had the operator and like yeah you

2772.64 --> 2777.5989999999997
figure it out

2774.16 --> 2780.3999999999996
yeah composers you know

2777.599 --> 2781.04
can be kind of expensive too and it was

2780.4 --> 2783.599
kind of like

2781.04 --> 2785.44
just a revamping project so they

2783.599 --> 2786.839
probably didn't have enough money to get

2785.44 --> 2789.839
a proper

2786.839 --> 2790.4
music composition for the new levels to

2789.839 --> 2793.599
kind of

2790.4 --> 2795.52
match the glory of the other of the rest

2793.599 --> 2799.6800000000003
so that is something that stood out to

2795.52 --> 2799.68
me and then i'm thinking like

2800.839 --> 2803.839
could

2804.4 --> 2809.92
could there just be more old polish gate

2807.52 --> 2813.44
style music that would really

2809.92 --> 2815.76
match it match the old style

2813.44 --> 2817.359
wondering sometimes because look there's

2815.76 --> 2820.88
like a hundred

2817.359 --> 2822.56
songs there's literally a tape just one

2820.88 --> 2825.6800000000003
song to the other

2822.56 --> 2829.119
two hours

2825.68 --> 2832.319
that's a mind-blowing amount of

2829.119 --> 2835.599
original classical music

2832.319 --> 2838.64
it's just mind-blowing amount

2835.599 --> 2838.6400000000003
but i want more

2839.2 --> 2845.359
every song it's just wow i want more i

2843.44 --> 2846.88
want more of this

2845.359 --> 2849.119
right now i'm talking again about the

2846.88 --> 2852.1600000000003
baldis gate 2 music i will

2849.119 --> 2854.8
just post the freaking file i'll just

2852.16 --> 2856.3999999999996
do it i'll do it live now i'm not going

2854.8 --> 2858.2400000000002
to play it but i'll put the link in

2856.4 --> 2860.2400000000002
there it's just a file you know

2858.24 --> 2862.0
there's probably a hundred people that

2860.24 --> 2864.9599999999996
have uploaded

2862.0 --> 2873.839
this music on their youtube channel

2864.96 --> 2873.839
because it's always around somewhere

2879.119 --> 2884.48
right so this is it i'm back into it

2882.72 --> 2885.9199999999996
and it's just the music because i don't

2884.48 --> 2887.2
at this point even want to play the

2885.92 --> 2890.16
games

2887.2 --> 2901.839
i might continue doing it at this point

2890.16 --> 2901.839
i'm like

2902.48 --> 2908.8
right oh

2905.52 --> 2912.0
i almost completely forgot

2908.8 --> 2915.76
there is like a baldur's gate

2912.0 --> 2918.48
3 that was kind of a

2915.76 --> 2920.48
in it was baldur's gate one and a half

2918.48 --> 2924.0
that also happened

2920.48 --> 2926.72
and that one did get really good music

2924.0 --> 2929.04
i'm gonna have to study that i'm sure

2926.72 --> 2931.2
it's online i have the game

2929.04 --> 2934.079
is that paid for it even it's a bit well

2931.2 --> 2934.0789999999997
worth the investment

2935.28 --> 2939.119
it's what is it called yeah uh

2940.96 --> 2945.52
let's see i'm just gonna open it up i

2943.44 --> 2949.2000000000003
forgot the direct name

2945.52 --> 2949.2
now you're probably gonna hear the music

2952.88 --> 2957.839
ah yeah siege of the dragon spear that's

2955.2 --> 2957.839
right

2958.319 --> 2967.599
man when that one came out just like

2962.079 --> 2972.559
unbelievable it was a pretty good one

2967.599 --> 2974.559
it it wasn't as absolutely fantastical

2972.559 --> 2975.76
as the first one or the second one but

2974.559 --> 2978.1600000000003
it was

2975.76 --> 2981.0400000000004
really good enough to be a worthy

2978.16 --> 2981.04
in-between game

2982.839 --> 2985.839
anyway

2994.319 --> 2999.839
the girl in the video game does a nice

2996.24 --> 2999.839
rendition of ahaz

3000.8 --> 3006.319
what are you talking about guns of never

3010.839 --> 3013.839
own

3019.119 --> 3022.96
the diablo soundtrack

3023.28 --> 3030.88
yeah well yeah diablo 3

3027.52 --> 3034.96
has some pretty spectacular sound

3030.88 --> 3038.1600000000003
music in there i agree but it's also

3034.96 --> 3038.16
freaking dark and

3038.24 --> 3043.839
creepy like i don't like listening the

3041.599 --> 3045.119
music but it does blow my mind

3043.839 --> 3047.119
certain tracks it's just like

3045.119 --> 3050.559
unbelievable

3047.119 --> 3054.2400000000002
it's like this like a diabolical

3050.559 --> 3056.88
orchestra [ __ ] it's pretty mind-blowing

3054.24 --> 3057.52
but i don't like it in the sense that i

3056.88 --> 3060.4
don't like

3057.52 --> 3060.4
listening to that

3060.88 --> 3066.1600000000003
i don't have that same effect with the

3063.44 --> 3066.16
baldur's gate

3066.839 --> 3069.839
music

3087.04 --> 3094.64
all right yeah yeah yeah you mean the uh

3091.359 --> 3096.16
yeah the the song of diablo right it is

3094.64 --> 3099.04
the guitar song of the

3096.16 --> 3100.16
of the village tristrum the tristrum

3099.04 --> 3102.4
theme

3100.16 --> 3104.3999999999996
yeah it's like that's really awesome

3102.4 --> 3106.2400000000002
music it's like the calm music in the

3104.4 --> 3109.2000000000003
background it

3106.24 --> 3111.1189999999997
i remember that even from diablo one

3109.2 --> 3113.5989999999997
there's been like orchestral

3111.119 --> 3113.599
public

3117.44 --> 3121.52
public performances with that i know it

3120.559 --> 3124.2400000000002
is quite

3121.52 --> 3125.28
famous that music and that song yeah i

3124.24 --> 3128.319
do kind of like it

3125.28 --> 3128.3190000000004
the tristrum theme

3129.839 --> 3134.0
i never said that diablo music like is

3132.319 --> 3138.319
bad

3134.0 --> 3142.72
it's just dark

3138.319 --> 3142.72
and yeah

3144.16 --> 3149.7599999999998
i don't like that anymore i really don't

3147.599 --> 3153.839
it's kind of losing the older i get it

3149.76 --> 3153.8390000000004
the more it's losing its appeal to me

3166.079 --> 3171.3590000000004
all right but yeah if i'm gonna expand

3170.0 --> 3174.48
on the whole music thing

3171.359 --> 3181.119
you know what makes a for me what makes

3174.48 --> 3183.359
music really good

3181.119 --> 3185.359
it's extremely difficult because there's

3183.359 --> 3189.359
like two problems

3185.359 --> 3194.0
that typically enter with music

3189.359 --> 3195.92
one it's too cliche what does that mean

3194.0 --> 3199.04
that's even kind of complicated to

3195.92 --> 3203.52
explain but i'll try later

3199.04 --> 3206.72
or two it's trying to be too original

3203.52 --> 3211.359
or over does something

3206.72 --> 3211.359
like darkness or yeah like

3213.119 --> 3216.48
and yeah when you want to have music

3215.119 --> 3219.359
that's like really

3216.48 --> 3220.88
just nice and peaceful and all that the

3219.359 --> 3223.44
risks of cliches

3220.88 --> 3225.359
are higher it's like very difficult to

3223.44 --> 3227.44
make something and then make it work you

3225.359 --> 3229.2799999999997
have to be really good at music in order

3227.44 --> 3231.44
to do that and to even see

3229.28 --> 3232.88
when you're when you're gonna yeah

3231.44 --> 3234.48
insert a cliche in there

3232.88 --> 3236.079
and now this is one of the things that

3234.48 --> 3238.559
just absolutely blew my

3236.079 --> 3240.2400000000002
mind in the entire baldrige gate music

3238.559 --> 3244.4
is that

3240.24 --> 3247.4399999999996
there's no cliche effect whatsoever it's

3244.4 --> 3250.7200000000003
it's not there and when it is

3247.44 --> 3252.64
it is recognized and

3250.72 --> 3254.9599999999996
and like processed so that it's

3252.64 --> 3257.92
effectively not cliche anymore it's then

3254.96 --> 3259.359
that that's like a detailed thing that i

3257.92 --> 3261.359
don't know if even people

3259.359 --> 3262.839
notice that when they listen that is

3261.359 --> 3267.359
just like ah

3262.839 --> 3267.359
whoa incredible

3268.64 --> 3275.359
to me because that's like

3272.72 --> 3277.1189999999997
that's a sign of just composition

3275.359 --> 3279.04
mastery to me

3277.119 --> 3280.1600000000003
if you can do that right if you can have

3279.04 --> 3284.16
that balance

3280.16 --> 3285.839
correct i and the yeah i can only speak

3284.16 --> 3287.2
from the perspective of somebody that

3285.839 --> 3290.839
just

3287.2 --> 3292.48
can hear music because i i'm not a music

3290.839 --> 3295.52
producer

3292.48 --> 3298.64
my mother was father was

3295.52 --> 3302.0
i never really was

3298.64 --> 3302.0
i'm more of an analyst

3304.0 --> 3308.559
and i do get swept away by music a lot

3306.24 --> 3308.5589999999997
anyway

3313.28 --> 3318.559
i i have heard a full choir in person

3316.24 --> 3321.2799999999997
robin stanley i've i've been

3318.559 --> 3323.6800000000003
i've had some pretty amazing experiences

3321.28 --> 3323.6800000000003
with that

3326.0 --> 3329.44
like i've seen a live performance of a

3328.72 --> 3332.839
stumpy

3329.44 --> 3335.839
in a church building it's

3332.839 --> 3336.64
unbelievable and i've seen big choirs in

3335.839 --> 3339.68
a church

3336.64 --> 3344.0
not from yeah not

3339.68 --> 3347.2
doing a a mass or anything

3344.0 --> 3350.079
but yeah basically a gothic

3347.2 --> 3350.72
type thing or something classical music

3350.079 --> 3353.44
that was

3350.72 --> 3356.319
in the building was just lent in the in

3353.44 --> 3359.359
the situation

3356.319 --> 3362.88
it was really weird by the way because

3359.359 --> 3365.04
when i saw a stompy life that's like the

3362.88 --> 3365.76
first time i saw my ex-girlfriend and

3365.04 --> 3368.72
that was like

3365.76 --> 3377.8390000000004
a year before i really met her that was

3368.72 --> 3377.839
pretty bizarre

3396.0 --> 3405.839
yeah that's right guns of nephron rnp

3410.079 --> 3418.6400000000003
trans siberian orchestra oh i bet it is

3415.359 --> 3422.5589999999997
you know a lot of great

3418.64 --> 3433.839
classical elements are from

3422.559 --> 3433.8390000000004
russia and those regions

3439.32 --> 3442.369
[Music]

3448.0 --> 3450.4
all right

3453.48 --> 3461.839
[Music]

3458.0 --> 3461.839
general public

3464.96 --> 3468.079
all right you know what i think about

3467.359 --> 3472.0789999999997
that

3468.079 --> 3475.52
the general public and why they don't

3472.079 --> 3479.119
tend to like absolutely glorious music

3475.52 --> 3482.0
because it overwhelms them because their

3479.119 --> 3482.96
consciousness does not know what to do

3482.0 --> 3487.2
with the glory

3482.96 --> 3490.4
so they zone out because it hurts them

3487.2 --> 3493.359
it's literally it's just

3490.4 --> 3495.76
you can't yeah that's what i think is

3493.359 --> 3495.7599999999998
happening

3496.24 --> 3504.799
and it's universal it's like

3502.0 --> 3506.079
they just can't handle the depth of what

3504.799 --> 3508.0
is out there

3506.079 --> 3509.3590000000004
because they all got stuck and then they

3508.0 --> 3513.76
started building

3509.359 --> 3513.7599999999998
from that vantage point of being stuck

3514.24 --> 3517.7599999999998
but with that that includes a

3515.92 --> 3519.599
perspective that can only come from that

3517.76 --> 3523.0400000000004
direction so that just

3519.599 --> 3525.599
if something is just blatantly obviously

3523.04 --> 3526.96
more than what they have assigned

3525.599 --> 3529.6800000000003
themselves to be

3526.96 --> 3533.2
it just burns them and they just zone

3529.68 --> 3533.2
out they don't want to know about it

3534.16 --> 3540.64
and that's by the way not just music but

3537.599 --> 3540.6400000000003
with music also

3542.319 --> 3547.359
i think it is the reason why a lot of

3543.92 --> 3550.2400000000002
people don't like classical music

3547.359 --> 3551.2
because there is no good reason why you

3550.24 --> 3553.359
anyone

3551.2 --> 3555.359
could not like classical music except if

3553.359 --> 3559.68
it's like extremely cliche

3555.359 --> 3562.0789999999997
classical music which does exist

3559.68 --> 3565.44
or like i don't know there's different

3562.079 --> 3568.0
tastes you know in classical music so

3565.44 --> 3573.839
so nobody's gonna like everything that's

3568.0 --> 3573.839
for sure

3576.37 --> 3579.6
[Music]

3584.839 --> 3587.839
hmm

3598.839 --> 3602.72
hmm

3600.48 --> 3605.2
yeah eyes wide shut guns have never run

3602.72 --> 3605.2
don't worry

3605.44 --> 3611.839
no it's it's not even his face it's a

3608.24 --> 3615.839
computer animated version of his face

3611.839 --> 3615.839
that he uses now

3619.68 --> 3623.839
but yeah nobody cares anyway

3624.64 --> 3629.839
just leave it because

3640.96 --> 3644.16
all right whatever

3644.24 --> 3656.799
uh yeah don't address in my pandem

3648.079 --> 3660.079
so let's just leave it

3656.799 --> 3660.079
right so music

3660.96 --> 3664.7200000000003
yeah lot into music right now i also

3664.24 --> 3670.3999999999996
listen

3664.72 --> 3672.8799999999997
back some really weird other game music

3670.4 --> 3675.119
that tends to have like extreme

3672.88 --> 3676.2400000000002
emotional reaction there's this one song

3675.119 --> 3679.52
it's and it's like

3676.24 --> 3683.5989999999997
really sad

3679.52 --> 3685.119
but like heartfelt sad it's like a song

3683.599 --> 3688.2400000000002
of grief and like every

3685.119 --> 3690.319
it's like with cellos and all that but

3688.24 --> 3693.2799999999997
pretty wide

3690.319 --> 3695.04
with i don't know and that song man

3693.28 --> 3698.1600000000003
every time i hear it i just start

3695.04 --> 3700.24
crying like really a lot like really

3698.16 --> 3701.92
deep it's weird

3700.24 --> 3703.359
i listened to it again yesterday and in

3701.92 --> 3707.839
a way it's weird because i

3703.359 --> 3709.44
don't cry you know i i don't cry anymore

3707.839 --> 3711.2799999999997
you know crying to me is like an

3709.44 --> 3713.68
emergency

3711.28 --> 3715.2000000000003
stress evacuation system that's how i

3713.68 --> 3718.3999999999996
regard it i've learned

3715.2 --> 3719.52
early on to basically step away from the

3718.4 --> 3721.76
manly approach

3719.52 --> 3723.839
like men don't cry and i'm like yeah but

3721.76 --> 3726.88
i don't want to die

3723.839 --> 3729.2
you know at some point

3726.88 --> 3731.039
it's like my head is just going to break

3729.2 --> 3735.2799999999997
so i am going to cry

3731.039 --> 3735.28
i don't care what people think of it

3735.68 --> 3739.2799999999997
like if they're gonna hear that and

3737.52 --> 3742.319
nobody ever does

3739.28 --> 3744.1600000000003
don't do that in public like that maybe

3742.319 --> 3745.599
face to face if i'm really in a

3744.16 --> 3747.5989999999997
conversation but then i

3745.599 --> 3749.039
even don't i never throw it out like

3747.599 --> 3751.28
that

3749.039 --> 3755.039
i used to though it's not a good way to

3751.28 --> 3758.1600000000003
go around especially

3755.039 --> 3760.4
but yeah that music just it just pulls

3758.16 --> 3762.5589999999997
it out of me like

3760.4 --> 3764.1600000000003
just like that and it it kind of cleaned

3762.559 --> 3766.96
me up in a weird way

3764.16 --> 3769.2799999999997
and i forget about that is that crying

3766.96 --> 3770.799
itself for some reason has like this

3769.28 --> 3775.2000000000003
weird

3770.799 --> 3777.839
chemical process in your system

3775.2 --> 3780.0789999999997
and i can't explain how it works but it

3777.839 --> 3782.48
it like it cleans things up too

3780.079 --> 3783.52
but in a unique way different from

3782.48 --> 3786.64
typical

3783.52 --> 3790.079
like a cold situation or like whatever

3786.64 --> 3791.92
cleanse through substances like liver

3790.079 --> 3794.88
cleanses and all that you're gonna take

3791.92 --> 3796.319
no crying does something pretty unique

3794.88 --> 3800.4
and

3796.319 --> 3803.7599999999998
yeah it cleansed me yesterday just

3800.4 --> 3803.76
doing that it's weird

3804.559 --> 3808.48
also that i didn't expect that it would

3806.64 --> 3810.16
happen again i remembered the song and i

3808.48 --> 3812.16
like remember yeah i used to

3810.16 --> 3813.52
man that song i used to cry and then

3812.16 --> 3815.5989999999997
bang

3813.52 --> 3818.96
just went there again but how does it do

3815.599 --> 3822.6400000000003
that that song well it somehow

3818.96 --> 3826.079
reflects back to me just the things

3822.64 --> 3827.7599999999998
about my life that i very tragically

3826.079 --> 3828.799
conflicted about it's really that

3827.76 --> 3830.7990000000004
combination

3828.799 --> 3832.24
and it kind of pulls it forward out of

3830.799 --> 3835.28
me

3832.24 --> 3836.799
right but anyway it's is a very specific

3835.28 --> 3839.52
song from a game

3836.799 --> 3840.4
called endless legend which is a

3839.52 --> 3844.0
continuing

3840.4 --> 3845.52
game from endless space and

3844.0 --> 3847.44
not all of the music in there is good

3845.52 --> 3850.16
it's very original though

3847.44 --> 3850.799
it's very original all of that music but

3850.16 --> 3852.319
yeah

3850.799 --> 3854.72
anyway that's as far as i'll go with

3852.319 --> 3856.0
that you if you want to find that song

3854.72 --> 3859.5989999999997
you'll find that song and you'll

3856.0 --> 3863.44
probably know which one i mean

3859.599 --> 3865.28
if you really want to know and dig it up

3863.44 --> 3867.599
anyway yeah you can find endless legend

3865.28 --> 3871.3590000000004
music on youtube as well

3867.599 --> 3871.3590000000004
just like almost every game out there

3877.44 --> 3882.799
i like the music from and endless space

3879.68 --> 3885.2799999999997
too by the way a lot of bells

3882.799 --> 3887.92
you gotta have bells a lot of bells but

3885.28 --> 3887.92
i liked it

3888.079 --> 3891.3590000000004
too bad i can't play the game anymore

3889.839 --> 3893.119
this just

3891.359 --> 3896.799
doesn't work on my computer anymore for

3893.119 --> 3896.799
some reason and i can't figure it out

3901.359 --> 3909.839
oh god don't start talking about

3903.28 --> 3909.8390000000004
freaking masks please

3911.24 --> 3916.319
melancholy music

3914.559 --> 3918.0
guns have never run i'll go thank you

3916.319 --> 3923.839
for sharing that

3918.0 --> 3923.839
you know

3925.44 --> 3928.64
right you know with crying it's

3927.839 --> 3931.2
difficult

3928.64 --> 3932.319
how do we manage this how did we how did

3931.2 --> 3934.72
culture manage

3932.319 --> 3936.16
the concept of crying in the past there

3934.72 --> 3937.839
were like roles

3936.16 --> 3940.24
you know and that went even as far as

3937.839 --> 3942.16
that for example in arabia and other

3940.24 --> 3943.9199999999996
type countries it would be the women

3942.16 --> 3947.359
that would

3943.92 --> 3951.28
almost like have this obligation

3947.359 --> 3953.5989999999997
to cry in tragic situations

3951.28 --> 3954.88
while the men would not this like almost

3953.599 --> 3956.88
a sec role to it

3954.88 --> 3959.28
well then in the western world the

3956.88 --> 3961.039
remnants of that came forth

3959.28 --> 3962.96
but they weren't important anymore and

3961.039 --> 3966.6400000000003
then it kind of started to

3962.96 --> 3969.68
become a the crying

3966.64 --> 3971.92
started to become a social manipulation

3969.68 --> 3974.16
tool and that's where the real [ __ ]

3971.92 --> 3976.96
started

3974.16 --> 3977.68
you know because hey somebody that is

3976.96 --> 3980.64
feels

3977.68 --> 3982.0
pain his heart is sad there's a lot of

3980.64 --> 3985.0389999999998
people that will

3982.0 --> 3985.839
then feel uh yeah have impulses to help

3985.039 --> 3989.2000000000003
them

3985.839 --> 3989.2
or if you abuse that

3989.359 --> 3994.16
yeah you can basically ride on other

3991.92 --> 3997.76
people's sympathy and then get

3994.16 --> 3997.7599999999998
get well

3998.24 --> 4002.0789999999997
you might get somewhere even with that

4000.48 --> 4003.599
it's like the emo thing

4002.079 --> 4005.3590000000004
i'm embarrassed to say that i kind of

4003.599 --> 4007.839
partially did that

4005.359 --> 4008.96
with my life early on but i didn't

4007.839 --> 4011.44
didn't really go

4008.96 --> 4013.599
like full emo social just i'm not gonna

4011.44 --> 4015.28
completely embarrass myself in public

4013.599 --> 4018.88
like that

4015.28 --> 4021.119
but i would also always basically end up

4018.88 --> 4023.2000000000003
sharing like yeah i do have a difficult

4021.119 --> 4026.96
life

4023.2 --> 4030.24
i need some help i'm burdened by

4026.96 --> 4033.359
a lot of painful emotions and

4030.24 --> 4034.5589999999997
terrible things and realizations about

4033.359 --> 4036.96
the world and

4034.559 --> 4036.96
struggle

4040.24 --> 4043.5989999999997
i love crying when i'm happy

4045.599 --> 4049.599
i love crying and laughing that also

4048.079 --> 4052.88
does happen

4049.599 --> 4056.1600000000003
sometimes if i'm like in the in a

4052.88 --> 4056.1600000000003
certain type of energy

4056.48 --> 4060.839
but i see it purely like crying is a

4059.079 --> 4063.8390000000004
therapeutical

4060.839 --> 4063.839
and

4064.4 --> 4069.92
it's a it's a therapeutical tool

4067.52 --> 4070.799
for an individual to basically reflect

4069.92 --> 4074.48
upon

4070.799 --> 4077.52
things of themselves and then basically

4074.48 --> 4079.52
wash it away and clean it up and it also

4077.52 --> 4080.079
has a physical side effect that's pretty

4079.52 --> 4081.92
unique

4080.079 --> 4083.76
so if you take it like that and you can

4081.92 --> 4086.0
try to keep it private

4083.76 --> 4087.6800000000003
it's no problem now every sensible

4086.0 --> 4089.599
person in the world knows this

4087.68 --> 4092.319
but the problem is unfortunately as i

4089.599 --> 4095.3590000000004
referred to earlier that also

4092.319 --> 4096.4
crying has become a social manipulation

4095.359 --> 4099.04
tool

4096.4 --> 4100.639999999999
and that is just the worst freaking

4099.04 --> 4103.199
development ever

4100.64 --> 4104.4800000000005
you know and yeah some girls for example

4103.199 --> 4107.2789999999995
classically

4104.48 --> 4108.3189999999995
play around with it a little you know a

4107.279 --> 4110.400000000001
little

4108.319 --> 4113.04
little man jung sometimes has a little

4110.4 --> 4115.92
bit of these tendencies but

4113.04 --> 4116.96
you know that's okay because you're not

4115.92 --> 4118.96
trying to black

4116.96 --> 4121.04
literally blackmail it's like a

4118.96 --> 4124.4
voluntary blackmail

4121.04 --> 4125.92
this is or like a yeah a baby bird

4124.4 --> 4128.239
crying effect

4125.92 --> 4130.08
you know then they they're not gonna

4128.239 --> 4132.08
force anyone

4130.08 --> 4133.359
but there's people out there that do get

4132.08 --> 4136.3189999999995
pushy with that [ __ ]

4133.359 --> 4138.08
and that's just terrible like they

4136.319 --> 4140.64
really try to blackmail people with

4138.08 --> 4143.2789999999995
emotions and [ __ ] and like oh i'm gonna

4140.64 --> 4145.92
rat on you or something because of

4143.279 --> 4147.279
emotion and that's just the worst that's

4145.92 --> 4148.88

it really it's not even grief anymore

4179.04 --> 4184.719
it's just emulated grief it's just an

4181.359 --> 4188.319
act of grief because these people are so

4184.719 --> 4190.159
vacant so devoid of any real essence

4188.319 --> 4192.64
that they don't even receive

4190.159 --> 4193.5199999999995
real emotions anymore they're just using

4192.64 --> 4195.76
it

4193.52 --> 4197.76
to try to get ahead it's just a social

4195.76 --> 4199.92
weapon to them
