2.67 --> 12.219
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

6.67 --> 14.709
early-bird this is the second run at

12.219 --> 16.74
today I unfortunately have no guests

14.709 --> 22.42
right at the start

16.74 --> 24.25
still hoping to get some yeah okay let's

22.42 --> 28.830000000000002
see what can I talk about in the

24.25 --> 31.93
meantime Patricia's hangout yesterday

28.83 --> 33.519
was kind of weird because I was in the

31.93 --> 35.679
middle of watching a movie when that

33.519 --> 39.55
thing started and I decided to continue

35.679 --> 45.219
watching the movie so I missed like the

39.55 --> 47.019
first 50 minutes but then I yeah I

45.219 --> 49.629000000000005
basically don't write in the middle of

47.019 --> 53.94
it and he was shown his chart and all

49.629 --> 53.94
that and it was quite incredible and

55.739 --> 62.638999999999996
yeah

57.129 --> 68.8
you had so much fine detailed

62.639 --> 73.21000000000001
information that's just so it gave me

68.8 --> 75.22
major déjà vu and I also recognized some

73.21 --> 78.03
of his descriptions about what

75.22 --> 82.6
supposedly going to happen in 2020

78.03 --> 85.71000000000001
recognized it very strongly and from my

82.6 --> 91.75
own visions basically so I'm wondering

85.71 --> 95.74
where my visions basically in my

91.75 --> 97.57
imagination of this moment of trying to

95.74 --> 100.33
and visualize what he was talking about

97.57 --> 103.96
or will that really happen

100.33 --> 111.36
and did I experience it from my vision

103.96 --> 116.02
memories I can only confirm dark world

111.36 --> 120.37
sighting so don't have memories of

116.02 --> 127.14999999999999
daylight during these also called purple

120.37 --> 130.03
mist so I don't know I have no more I

127.15 --> 132.52
have no official confirmation that it

130.03 --> 133.89000000000001
could be real in that sense but it

132.52 --> 138.209
struck me

133.89 --> 140.04
strongly so that's what my hands I kind

138.209 --> 143.1
of think that it's probably that he's

140.04 --> 146.57999999999998
probably right in many ways and I also

143.1 --> 149.1
find his cosmic egg model quite

146.58 --> 156.99
fascinating it is funny how it is still

149.1 --> 159.84
a disc but yeah lands beyond and in this

156.99 --> 162.54000000000002
in a sequence and that is very similar

159.84 --> 164.1
to the rectangular looping model only

162.54 --> 166.5
difference with the rectangular looping

164.1 --> 171.06
model is that it's not circle century so

166.5 --> 175.47
if you take my looping mole and his

171.06 --> 177.81
cosmic egg concept as projections then

175.47 --> 183.42
they're kind of they could kind of be

177.81 --> 185.76
alike that's funny so yeah it I thought

183.42 --> 189.03
about it like all night so it really

185.76 --> 192.239
kept me going I would love to talk to

189.03 --> 195.78
that guy maybe have an interview if he's

192.239 --> 197.79
available or I don't know I think this I

195.78 --> 200.25
could just let this guy talk for a long

197.79 --> 201.87
time it becomes like oh my god yeah that

200.25 --> 205.709
reminds me of this that reminds me of

201.87 --> 209.06
that probably be a mess anyway let's

205.709 --> 214.53
take a look at chat here hello and

209.06 --> 218.519
Nicolas thetic Viking a Pilton pop mine

214.53 --> 219.0

Earth related in some way

267.29 --> 273.87
alternative history turned into medicine

271.52 --> 276.45
even if you want to talk about political

273.87 --> 280.25
offense currency and yeah there is a lot

276.45 --> 282.96
more there seems to be a lot going on

280.25 --> 287.28
anything is fine by me

282.96 --> 294.91999999999996
hey my first guest for today allow

351.29 --> 358.23
wrinkles ironed out you know I mean

354.83 --> 360.99
using hang out you're gonna record it

358.23 --> 364.35
and then just smooth it out yeah I don't

360.99 --> 371.88

404.88 --> 411.3
so I've seen a few of his videos and uh

409.19 --> 412.919
he and I were supposed to try to do

411.3 --> 415.5
something this morning but we're we've

412.919 --> 417.63
got mixed signals right now so if by

415.5 --> 419.72

417.63 --> 421.15999999999997
ready that I'm gonna probably pop off Oh

419.72 --> 426.22900000000004
God

421.16 --> 427.38000000000005
but until then I'm getting something

426.229 --> 429.65999999999997
okay

427.38 --> 432.46999999999997
see there you go it's all about trying

429.66 --> 435.44
to figure this stuff out

432.47 --> 439.08000000000004
yeah you're in a diner or suckers

435.44 --> 446.09
no I'm in my apartment but I only have

439.08 --> 446.09
my phone is my source for Wi-Fi so it's

446.96 --> 452.96
all right I'll just have to get to this

453.47 --> 459.28900000000004
anyway yeah oh really yeah

456.479 --> 464.669
looking forward to hearing now that

459.289 --> 466.53
interview with Jason right yeah yeah I

464.669 --> 476.789
tried to come up with some some good

466.53 --> 479.46
journalistic question anything well they

476.789 --> 481.11
I think it it's pretty much well let me

479.46 --> 482.88
see I can pull off some I mean they're

481.11 --> 484.5
they're questions that I tried to

482.88 --> 487.77
formulate based on episodes that I've

484.5 --> 491.97
listened for them you know so it's

487.77 --> 497.21999999999997
almost yeah or at least contextually

491.97 --> 500.90900000000005
specific you know so I mean one one

497.22 --> 506.699
generic question that could be given to

500.909 --> 510.27
anyone is if you could help a person

506.699 --> 512.75
begin to see the world correctly how

510.27 --> 512.75
would you begin

519.53 --> 526.5799999999999
I personally I'm good answer if I would

524.21 --> 529.19
start the question like yeah do you

526.58 --> 532.1
think that you have to start somewhere

529.19 --> 536.33
so I'd start with these that politicians

532.1 --> 539.39
are lying it's like the open goal and

536.33 --> 541.01
then once you get that we can as they

539.39 --> 543.11
say like oh yeah do you think that

541.01 --> 545.9
perhaps other people he caught from

543.11 --> 547.21
inner conspiring with them and also are

545.9 --> 550.49
liars

547.21 --> 551.7800000000001
yeah and then move it on and on and then

550.49 --> 555.52
bring in like what do you think about

551.78 --> 557.5
9/11 and then just step by step by step

555.52 --> 560.51
see how they react

557.5 --> 562.4
so see if they're already interested in

560.51 --> 566.51
one of these subjects because that helps

562.4 --> 570.1999999999999
a lot bring out that energy that

566.51 --> 575.24
enthusiasm and then see how does flatter

570.2 --> 576.6400000000001
a swing-off okay so thinking about those

575.24 --> 579.89
those questions

576.64 --> 582.47
how would you in a discussion if I were

579.89 --> 585.23
the person who was still asleep how

582.47 --> 589.01
would you help me correlate between your

585.23 --> 592.6700000000001
question of politicians being dishonest

589.01 --> 595.58
and 9/11 like so for me when I think

592.67 --> 599.06
about it this way there has to be

595.58 --> 600.3100000000001
something that is there has to be

599.06 --> 602.3599999999999
something that you're basing your

600.31 --> 605.0799999999999
connection upon it's not like you're

602.36 --> 610.07
just making this willy-nilly

605.08 --> 612.82
it's very very simple go ahead yes yes

610.07 --> 615.4000000000001
you just get into standard political

612.82 --> 619.5200000000001
political things which are on the news

615.4 --> 623.24
for example and yeah almost everyone

619.52 --> 627.47
will have cottony gotten something of

623.24 --> 630.5
that so anyone like seriously like how

627.47 --> 632.9300000000001
many people do you know that fully trust

630.5 --> 635.47
all politicians that have no idea that

632.93 --> 635.4699999999999
they're liars

636.04 --> 642.62
probably not that's why it's such an

639.2 --> 645.0200000000001
open goal to start out with to make them

642.62 --> 648.83
realize like yeah there are liars that

645.02 --> 651.0799999999999
are in comfort to certain extent right

648.83 --> 652.73
so now but again I'm on asleep so I'm

651.08 --> 653.1800000000001
saying okay I hear what you're saying I

652.73 --> 654.86
I am

653.18 --> 657.5
stand the political arena is that way

654.86 --> 662.57
but how does that correlate to 9/11 well

657.5 --> 666.16
Wow and then switch examples like once

662.57 --> 669.44
they get it you move on and eventually

666.16 --> 671.06
yeah you can take like actual samples or

669.44 --> 673.37
something that's like really recently

671.06 --> 675.79
happened they're very likely to be

673.37 --> 679.34
informed or at least interested in that

675.79 --> 681.56
once then they figure out like that you

679.34 --> 683.0
have insight what's going on then you

681.56 --> 691.2099999999999
can switch yeah what do you think about

683.0 --> 696.77
9/11 okay it's not an uncommon question

691.21 --> 699.1700000000001
sure yeah and from that you can run to

696.77 --> 703.0699999999999
the moon landing it's become quite a

699.17 --> 705.9799999999999
standard routine actually from the moon

703.07 --> 708.0500000000001
landing you could move on to history for

705.98 --> 711.14
example like how you think like

708.05 --> 713.9599999999999
everything happened in history as it is

711.14 --> 716.6
portrayed and perhaps move on to

713.96 --> 719.6500000000001
dinosaurs or whatever if they have some

716.6 --> 723.23
knowledge or interest in that field or

719.65 --> 726.17
just switch right like if they're really

723.23 --> 728.21
like amazed by the realization that's a

726.17 --> 731.9599999999999
really good moment to bring up Flat

728.21 --> 734.45
Earth because then they already realize

731.96 --> 738.8000000000001
like man there's so much that's actually

734.45 --> 741.47
completely not as presented and then

738.8 --> 744.5899999999999
something like Flat Earth might not have

741.47 --> 748.5500000000001
such a heavy response because they're

744.59 --> 755.98
staggered by the scope of what they just

748.55 --> 759.0799999999999
figured out anyway yeah it's a fairly

755.98 --> 762.59
feely feeling out process for me every

759.08 --> 768.26
time okay but this seems to work this

762.59 --> 770.0600000000001
method this sequence basically I could

768.26 --> 774.25
probably write a script about how to do

770.06 --> 776.78
it but it's pretty other being described

774.25 --> 780.86
that would be interesting having a

776.78 --> 783.68
script yeah we're just test it out have

780.86 --> 787.85
some bullet points in a little list

783.68 --> 790.8199999999999
it's how I used to do things partially

787.85 --> 794.36
at the beginning of the show like when I

790.82 --> 796.34
really started out right back with Flat

794.36 --> 798.0500000000001
Earth talks and everything I would just

796.34 --> 800.9
have bullet points because it works

798.05 --> 802.43
really well you can just like okay I'm

800.9 --> 805.25
getting lost I'm getting nervous wait

802.43 --> 808.7199999999999
what's a subject that I that could be

805.25 --> 808.72
handy and just look in a little list

810.1 --> 816.32
yeah I don't use it anymore because I

813.74 --> 817.7
know most of this stuff by heart now so

816.32 --> 820.61
sure yeah

817.7 --> 823.4300000000001
yeah but but at the beginning it's like

820.61 --> 827.33
you said it's it's a good outline indeed

823.43 --> 836.15
bullet point lists are great it's like a

827.33 --> 840.1700000000001
grocery list but with data yeah anyway

836.15 --> 845.99
yeah what are other questions you had

840.17 --> 849.5899999999999
for Jason let's see what do you think is

845.99 --> 854.57
a splinter in mind of dumb people which

849.59 --> 856.01
of which they are not aware so well let

854.57 --> 858.0200000000001
me see if you understand that so I'll

856.01 --> 861.59
ask it again what do you think is a

858.02 --> 868.22
splinter in the minds of certain people

861.59 --> 870.08
of which they are not aware information

868.22 --> 871.58
they haven't heard yet so that's how

870.08 --> 872.38
that heavily conflicts with their

871.58 --> 875.39
beliefs

872.38 --> 878.21
well my out of mind then you're

875.39 --> 880.73
perfectly fine then if somebody suddenly

878.21 --> 882.59
mentions it to you and then the conflict

880.73 --> 884.87
starts and then it becomes a splinter in

882.59 --> 886.52
your mind and her it's really military

884.87 --> 889.49
yeah yeah that's that's more like

886.52 --> 890.96
inception to me I suppose but but if you

889.49 --> 894.02
think back to the matrix

890.96 --> 896.02
you know Morpheus said to neo there

894.02 --> 898.34
you've always known there's something

896.02 --> 900.02
you knew that there was something not

898.34 --> 905.9200000000001
right and it was like a splinter in your

900.02 --> 911.39
mind so I guess what I'm asking is oh

905.92 --> 914.8399999999999
that is just that the habit of everyone

911.39 --> 917.75
you know just let things go even though

914.84 --> 919.1700000000001
they're morally just inadequate or that

917.75 --> 922.14
that kind of thing

919.17 --> 924.269
that's three in our minds or people that

922.14 --> 927.74
actually have more a good moral nature

924.269 --> 934.26
that don't give up so easily

927.74 --> 939.0
of stronger impulses I don't know yeah

934.26 --> 943.079
but yeah to me though was a thing like I

939.0 --> 947.279
naturally questioned things that I'm

943.079 --> 949.8599999999999
told I did that from a young age would

947.279 --> 952.86
drive my parents nuts because I'd ask

949.86 --> 955.6800000000001
all over the place and not just stupid

952.86 --> 958.23
questions but like really freaking heavy

955.68 --> 962.79
and complex questions and ask about

958.23 --> 964.74
death and all that [ __ ] like like really

962.79 --> 969.3
wanted to know and like how do you know

964.74 --> 972.0600000000001
and religion all everything to know

969.3 --> 973.529
every freaking thing and I wasn't really

972.06 --> 976.529
ready for it because I was still a

973.529 --> 979.41
little kid but it was so curious that if

976.529 --> 981.87
almost my curiosity forced myself to go

979.41 --> 985.1899999999999
into places that I actually couldn't

981.87 --> 993.74
really handle but it was just so curious

985.19 --> 993.74
yeah let's see what else

996.62 --> 1006.74
so crow crow says there is no lie in

1001.57 --> 1008.9300000000001
nature and my question is what does that

1006.74 --> 1010.76
mean you know from his perspective there

1008.93 --> 1019.149
is no lie in nature what do you think

1010.76 --> 1022.149
about that statement no I think that's

1019.149 --> 1022.149
philosophically

1023.38 --> 1030.429
that's a philosophical statement that

1027.65 --> 1033.199
this would be very conflicted because

1030.429 --> 1038.66
creatures in nature constantly use

1033.199 --> 1042.38
deception to each other for hunting

1038.66 --> 1044.8390000000002
socially all kinds of things so I

1042.38 --> 1049.7600000000002
disagree that nature is without

1044.839 --> 1051.5
deception without yeah okay but I think

1049.76 --> 1052.8799999999999
that he would counter they by worker oh

1051.5 --> 1054.35
I would he was I think he would say

1052.88 --> 1056.3300000000002
something like okay well but what I'm

1054.35 --> 1059.9299999999998
talking about is you're observing those

1056.33 --> 1061.76
animals use that deception so in that is

1059.93 --> 1065.5700000000002
that is what I'm talking about your

1061.76 --> 1069.83
observation of their deception is not a

1065.57 --> 1072.47
deception nature reveals to you what you

1069.83 --> 1074.57
see so yeah you're right so you can say

1072.47 --> 1077.3600000000001
are when people lie well you you've

1074.57 --> 1081.35
observed talk of the nature of the

1077.36 --> 1083.57
Spirit of beings then yeah lies there

1081.35 --> 1088.52
what if you talk about the natural world

1083.57 --> 1090.83
like everything physicality that's a

1088.52 --> 1094.75
different matter than deception becomes

1090.83 --> 1098.06
pretty relative irrelevant and relative

1094.75 --> 1100.58
that's where the to influence another

1098.06 --> 1102.23
mind yeah that's where I think that his

1100.58 --> 1104.06
statement comes from is is in the

1102.23 --> 1106.34
observation so then my follow-up

1104.06 --> 1109.28
question was I said if there is no lie

1106.34 --> 1115.6999999999998
in nature what do you think the lunar

1109.28 --> 1120.61
wave is telling us that's not a part of

1115.7 --> 1125.03
nature perhaps on yeah we don't know

1120.61 --> 1135.83
yeah so you know what causes that what

1125.03 --> 1138.23
causes the moon right yeah yeah I

1135.83 --> 1141.9499999999998
appreciate your your insight I I really

1138.23 --> 1145.79
am challenged by your position on the

1141.95 --> 1153.8600000000001
non physicality of the Sun I think

1145.79 --> 1159.52
that's a pretty profound it just makes

1153.86 --> 1162.4699999999998
sense it's me do you have any other

1159.52 --> 1164.27
sources or references that you've seen

1162.47 --> 1169.88
other people talk about it that way is

1164.27 --> 1172.52
what I'm sorry event said yeah I wanted

1169.88 --> 1182.1200000000001
to join let's see if I can add him

1172.52 --> 1184.93
somehow could you add wait maybe I can

1182.12 --> 1184.9299999999998
enemy here

1185.39 --> 1188.39
right

1194.039 --> 1201.899
no his name is just event horizon right

1197.82 --> 1207.2
in Google as far as I know yeah all

1201.899 --> 1213.5089999999998
right no search results unfortunately

1207.2 --> 1214.2
ones with the anyway sorry I got

1213.509 --> 1218.7
sidetracked

1214.2 --> 1220.679
look were we talking about again the non

1218.7 --> 1224.789
physicality of the Sun I was asking if

1220.679 --> 1229.3790000000001
you had any other references or sources

1224.789 --> 1234.179
where you've seen people discuss that to

1229.379 --> 1236.2199999999998
be a hundred fair no the only reference

1234.179 --> 1243.72
I have is from my own vision

1236.22 --> 1246.71
I haven't better if you can find any

1243.72 --> 1251.009
that would be interesting yeah okay

1246.71 --> 1254.22
because even in a biblical sense I guess

1251.009 --> 1257.94
it is said that like the Stars our

1254.22 --> 1260.489
lights are just dancing lights not like

1257.94 --> 1262.799
candle flames but dancing lights yeah

1260.489 --> 1266.489
some in the moon it's basically not

1262.799 --> 1271.59
described maybe they erased that maybe

1266.489 --> 1278.039
they removed a few sentences to leave

1271.59 --> 1279.509
that maybe there was like yeah it is

1278.039 --> 1282.119
actually kind of like a looking glass

1279.509 --> 1286.59
from the throne of God or something you

1282.119 --> 1289.9499999999998
know or make is there sir I don't know

1286.59 --> 1294.2099999999998
the Bible is so freakin huge it's and to

1289.95 --> 1297.179
be yeah really read it yeah question is

1294.21 --> 1299.249
particular because I I'm pretty familiar

1297.179 --> 1302.0700000000002
with with the Bible so what's your

1299.249 --> 1304.919
question is there any description

1302.07 --> 1310.529
anywhere of the Sun being like the

1304.919 --> 1314.729
looking-glass from the throne of God or

1310.529 --> 1325.74
something mmm no I I've said this before

1314.729 --> 1337.919
a whole no hey event horizon hey

1325.74 --> 1339.72
why can't you join sorry I don't know

1337.919 --> 1345.3600000000001
how to add you I can't add you in the

1339.72 --> 1350.0
back channel alright tell him I'm gonna

1345.36 --> 1358.4599999999998
try to send him a link just do it yeah I

1350.0 --> 1358.46
gotta find his name but here we go

1365.279 --> 1372.539
yeah so the the Bible the Bible isn't a

1369.69 --> 1376.14
science book okay it's not it's not

1372.539 --> 1378.96
intended to be just biology or science

1376.14 --> 1381.39
or I mean we could we could you know we

1378.96 --> 1384.809
could argue just try to describe things

1381.39 --> 1387.929
in an archaic but as accurate as they

1384.809 --> 1392.52
could imagine possible way that's what I

1387.929 --> 1398.45
think with many things I've heard that

1392.52 --> 1401.82
also translation so it's hard yeah like

1398.45 --> 1408.39
you're gonna get language like the the

1401.82 --> 1413.059
Sun the Sun trap pulls its circuit from

1408.39 --> 1413.0590000000002
one end to the other something like that

1414.2 --> 1420.96
they're talking about over the earth or

1416.49 --> 1422.909
in your view I I would say again it

1420.96 --> 1425.909
doesn't it doesn't come with a glossary

1422.909 --> 1428.97
it doesn't come with a place where you

1425.909 --> 1431.7890000000002
can go and look to see it doesn't

1428.97 --> 1433.679
explain how it uses its language if

1431.789 --> 1436.2
you're reading it over and over again

1433.679 --> 1439.279
and I would say that the best way to say

1436.2 --> 1444.6000000000001
this is it speaks phenomenologically it

1439.279 --> 1447.27
speaks like you see it the Sun rises and

1444.6 --> 1453.57
the Sun sets I mean that's so the there

1447.27 --> 1455.49
is no word in in the Bible for East it's

1453.57 --> 1457.5
the rising of the Sun that's how the

1455.49 --> 1459.06
Bible says the east the rising of the

1457.5 --> 1466.08
Sun amazing

1459.06 --> 1468.78
so you have rising you have of the Sun

1466.08 --> 1471.0
so you have that those words exist in

1468.78 --> 1473.75
Hebrew and then when you put them

1471.0 --> 1477.39
together that's how they say the east

1473.75 --> 1479.34
and it's the same for any it's the same

1477.39 --> 1481.3200000000002
for any of the cardinal points north is

1479.34 --> 1482.9399999999998
a particular turn of phrase West is a

1481.32 --> 1485.22
particularly the setting of the same

1482.94 --> 1488.0700000000002
that's what the the Sun rises in the

1485.22 --> 1488.94
east until it sets in the same or

1488.07 --> 1491.25
something like that

1488.94 --> 1495.17
turkey setting of the same I'm mixing

1491.25 --> 1499.11
the way it says it but so it refers to

1495.17 --> 1501.8400000000001
its its appearance to us what it does in

1499.11 --> 1503.9699999999998
the sky that's how they they say so the

1501.84 --> 1508.02
Stars are lights that's how Genesis one

1503.97 --> 1511.08
begins the the on the fourth day the

1508.02 --> 1514.35
Lord creates the to greater lights want

1511.08 --> 1519.06
to rule the day rule right like it's

1514.35 --> 1520.9199999999998
literally says light yeah yeah the

1519.06 --> 1522.77
creator the greater light and the lesser

1520.92 --> 1528.8700000000001
light Wow

1522.77 --> 1536.0
that is a clear cut indication right

1528.87 --> 1542.6699999999998
there if it's lights just lights not a

1536.0 --> 1546.24
lamp or a it's it's just lights not it's

1542.67 --> 1555.27
not even a light just light yeah they're

1546.24 --> 1556.65
light that's freakin mind-blowing but to

1555.27 --> 1559.47
go back and answer your question no it

1556.65 --> 1561.8100000000002
doesn't describe it as if it's a lens in

1559.47 --> 1565.71
any way as I said that's not it's its

1561.81 --> 1573.77
purpose it doesn't try to investigate

1565.71 --> 1577.89
the science and I buddy how are you

1573.77 --> 1579.12
great excellent stuff what you talking

1577.89 --> 1579.66
about guys sorry I wasn't there for a

1579.12 --> 1582.8
couple minutes

1579.66 --> 1587.76
no no problem we were talking about

1582.8 --> 1591.18
Bible references to the this you had to

1587.76 --> 1592.02
the heart of the heavens to the Sun and

1591.18 --> 1594.3600000000001
Moon and

1592.02 --> 1596.1299999999999
just just for feel that it is basically

1594.36 --> 1600.3
described as to greater and lesser

1596.13 --> 1606.68
lights so not even lights or a lights

1600.3 --> 1606.68
just like and that's very telling to me

1606.83 --> 1611.3999999999999
now I've done a little bit a bit Bible

1609.3 --> 1613.04
study in my past and yeah the greater

1611.4 --> 1619.6200000000001
light and the lesser light and the

1613.04 --> 1621.18
styles of the heavens and so on one

1619.62 --> 1625.29
thing that I will say if you find this

1621.18 --> 1627.69
interesting is that the word in the same

1625.29 --> 1632.61
passage where it talks about the purpose

1627.69 --> 1636.93
for the lights it does describe it says

1632.61 --> 1641.49
they they shall be for days and for

1636.93 --> 1644.97
years and for seasons the the trick of

1641.49 --> 1649.2
it is is that the word see seasons is

1644.97 --> 1653.18
the same word that is used in the Book

1649.2 --> 1657.75
of Leviticus for festivals or

1653.18 --> 1659.49
celebrations festivals and so it's not

1657.75 --> 1662.01
again what I what I was trying to say

1659.49 --> 1664.83
before that the Bible is not a science

1662.01 --> 1667.2
book it's not trying to tell you the

1664.83 --> 1668.6699999999998
natural order of things that the Sun in

1667.2 --> 1673.22
the moon and the stars help us navigate

1668.67 --> 1677.16
our seasons fall summer or winter spring

1673.22 --> 1680.3600000000001
but they were they were they are that

1677.16 --> 1685.3500000000001
they are that but in the context of

1680.36 --> 1690.7199999999998
Israel Israel also orchestrated her

1685.35 --> 1694.08
festival celebrations after the patterns

1690.72 --> 1696.21
of the moon primarily I don't I don't

1694.08 --> 1697.59
believe I would say I don't believe they

1696.21 --> 1699.32
pattered their festivals after the

1697.59 --> 1703.32
constellations they were aware of them

1699.32 --> 1705.09
but the moon itself was the measurement

1703.32 --> 1708.6899999999998
how do you know when you're supposed to

1705.09 --> 1710.3999999999999
do Yom Kippur you know where the moon is

1708.69 --> 1711.66
you know what the moon is doing how do

1710.4 --> 1716.22
you know when you're supposed to do this

1711.66 --> 1718.53
festival this festival so in that

1716.22 --> 1720.06
passage where we're told about the Sun

1718.53 --> 1723.36
and the moon and the stars being created

1720.06 --> 1725.82
for days and years and I would I would

1723.36 --> 1729.51
translate it festivals

1725.82 --> 1730.83
not seasons it's interesting at the

1729.51 --> 1731.76
moment as well being as the means

1730.83 --> 1735.09
disappeared

1731.76 --> 1736.59
the comment which Jewish festival or

1735.09 --> 1738.12
celebration is but they're not allowed

1736.59 --> 1741.0
to start celebrating until they see the

1738.12 --> 1742.8899999999999
mean again it's appearing for the three

1741.0 --> 1744.78
days and then they have to watch and

1742.89 --> 1746.2800000000002
wait for the movie to come back and then

1744.78 --> 1748.44
as soon as they see the moon then they

1746.28 --> 1750.3899999999999
can continue with that celebration not a

1748.44 --> 1752.01
hundred percent okay with how the Jewish

1750.39 --> 1754.5900000000001
do it but I do know that they are very

1752.01 --> 1756.27
much moon based with our calendars and

1754.59 --> 1761.27
celebrations and feasts and festivals

1756.27 --> 1764.73
and so on yeah I think that that is a

1761.27 --> 1771.81
reference in Exodus chapter 12 I'm going

1764.73 --> 1774.8700000000001
to pull it up real quick okay so so

1771.81 --> 1776.46
Exodus chapter 12 starts off then Yahweh

1774.87 --> 1778.53
said to Moses and Aaron in the land of

1776.46 --> 1781.44
Egypt this month shall be for you the

1778.53 --> 1786.6
beginning of months and it shall be the

1781.44 --> 1789.18
first month of the year for you so you

1786.6 --> 1792.3
have their demarcations of their seasons

1789.18 --> 1794.4
by the beginning so you you know we

1792.3 --> 1799.83
talked about wordplay writer or word

1794.4 --> 1805.6200000000001
craft month is simply moon with with a

1799.83 --> 1809.6999999999998
th you know mo knots it's in all

1805.62 --> 1814.01
languages especially more in Europe it's

1809.7 --> 1817.7
just a month is a measure by the moon

1814.01 --> 1820.68
languages because Monday as well as

1817.7 --> 1821.79
Monday is moon day in French it's lundi

1820.68 --> 1823.77
which is lunar day

1821.79 --> 1826.6499999999999
exactly it's very it's very

1823.77 --> 1832.05
straightforward that's based on that

1826.65 --> 1835.0800000000002
it's not a mistake I'm just gonna pull

1832.05 --> 1836.97
up my um my Bible app real quick and

1835.08 --> 1839.79
look up the Hebrew for the word month

1836.97 --> 1841.68
and just see if it's related to moon you

1839.79 --> 1850.77
guys can carry on I'm gonna be

1841.68 --> 1853.0800000000002
distracted right so you know Jewish

1850.77 --> 1855.93
vegetables and ancient religious

1853.08 --> 1856.59
cultures point a lot towards the lights

1855.93 --> 1859.44
in the sky

1856.59 --> 1861.75
especially the moon it's quite

1859.44 --> 1863.549
of religious feasts are held around a

1861.75 --> 1865.74
million times or the month times as we

1863.549 --> 1869.85
were saying though the Travis well they

1865.74 --> 1871.44
use it as a clock yes sorry exactly it's

1869.85 --> 1875.279
right in the sky it's the clock in the

1871.44 --> 1877.97
sky so I mean you wouldn't go in from a

1875.279 --> 1880.23
flat earth kind of basis or the

1877.97 --> 1881.669
heliocentric model spinning around them

1880.23 --> 1883.529
flying through space you're not going to

1881.669 --> 1886.5590000000002
be able to reset that calendar or that

1883.529 --> 1899.46
clock every year I mean that that's not

1886.559 --> 1902.6689999999999
going to happen is it nope hey so

1899.46 --> 1905.159
Chinese New Year no it's just it's about

1902.669 --> 1907.8300000000002
two months or so it's the Hebrew year is

1905.159 --> 1910.169
fifty seven seven nine you're talking to

1907.83 --> 1912.6899999999998
me bru it's all a lunar raised by

1910.169 --> 1918.3890000000001
calendar and this is fifty seven seventy

1912.69 --> 1922.23
nine all right don't keep track of that

1918.389 --> 1927.09
calendar it's very interesting it's all

1922.23 --> 1934.769
they have leap months and such to handle

1927.09 --> 1936.9599999999998
the lunar - solar conversion and I heard

1934.769 --> 1938.519
Travis using the word Yahweh so I was

1936.96 --> 1939.75
wondering what version of the Bible it

1938.519 --> 1943.82
is because it's not the King James

1939.75 --> 1946.83
obviously or we'd be hearing Lord I

1943.82 --> 1949.59
that's I am that's my own proclivity

1946.83 --> 1956.34
because uh the all-caps

1949.59 --> 1958.1689999999999
lor D is a translation of Yahweh you

1956.34 --> 1960.6
know a lot of times we're not sure it

1958.169 --> 1963.3300000000002
could be Yahweh or it could be it could

1960.6 --> 1970.519
also be you know heme depending where it

1963.33 --> 1974.9399999999998
is I don't - it's the Elohim are

1970.519 --> 1978.1200000000001
basically the ends of the Creator right

1974.94 --> 1980.97
the angels here Elohim the many so in

1978.12 --> 1983.09
fact this verse is very the angels it's

1980.97 --> 1986.429
different they are physical

1983.09 --> 1990.149
manifestations and angels don't normally

1986.429 --> 1992.98
do that you still are the losers they

1990.149 --> 1996.34
you could call them they are the

1992.98 --> 1999.88
creator split up right until we're meant

1996.34 --> 2001.9499999999998
to manifest with spoon and that's where

1999.88 --> 2004.3500000000001
the entire concept of the Pantheon comes

2001.95 --> 2007.2
from sure well when we get back to the

2004.35 --> 2011.48
original Genesis it says we created man

2007.2 --> 2011.48
in our own image yep

2012.2 --> 2016.5900000000001
right so what I was just gonna say Jim

2015.0 --> 2018.54
I'm not I'm not disagreeing with with

2016.59 --> 2022.35
anything except for the fact that Elohim

2018.54 --> 2027.12
and Yahweh aren't usually confused in

2022.35 --> 2032.1599999999999
translation so for instance if a passage

2027.12 --> 2035.58
said Elohim they wouldn't put Yahweh or

2032.16 --> 2039.2900000000002
Lord in their translation of that I I've

2035.58 --> 2043.5
never seen that in a in an aspect of

2039.29 --> 2046.5
translation look of my east north while

2043.5 --> 2051.859
you're chatting here yeah so just um

2046.5 --> 2055.139
just a basic perusal on my on my Bible

2051.859 --> 2060.2599999999998
website it it just referred the the

2055.139 --> 2065.389
Hebrew word from the moon is Pradesh and

2060.26 --> 2065.389
it basically just listed as a new moon

2066.05 --> 2072.2400000000002
so isn't that the face book on freedom I

2069.33 --> 2074.369
mean the new main feds yeah yeah but but

2072.24 --> 2076.8889999999997
every month does it it every month does

2074.369 --> 2080.46
it so you you have a new moon arey every

2076.889 --> 2082.8
month but in Exodus 12 you know there's

2080.46 --> 2086.55
a reference to I'm not sure if we know

2082.8 --> 2089.8790000000004
so when it says this month shall be for

2086.55 --> 2091.44
you the beginning of months they would

2089.879 --> 2093.419
have known what month it was because

2091.44 --> 2098.46
they were there for us it doesn't tell

2093.419 --> 2102.2999999999997
us what month it was but because we know

2098.46 --> 2103.83
when the Passover is now we then could

2102.3 --> 2105.869
go back and say okay now we know what

2103.83 --> 2109.0499999999997
month this was because we know from

2105.869 --> 2117.27
history how their festivals are set up I

2109.05 --> 2119.67
think Passover is in the spring yeah it

2117.27 --> 2121.53
isn't it it's it's somewhat close to

2119.67 --> 2123.69
Easter but not because Easter is all

2121.53 --> 2125.28
kind of Easter is pagan based so it has

2123.69 --> 2126.84
nothing that we don't find Easter in the

2125.28 --> 2129.6600000000003
in the scriptures anywhere

2126.84 --> 2133.65
that's just part over dinner yes it is

2129.66 --> 2137.1299999999997
in fact the Messiah was killed before

2133.65 --> 2138.87
the beginning of Passover because the or

2137.13 --> 2140.58
I think it was from before the beginning

2138.87 --> 2141.96
of the Sabbath whatever it was because

2140.58 --> 2146.58
they didn't want to have blood on their

2141.96 --> 2155.07
hands on the Sabbath yeah that's not a

2146.58 --> 2158.1
story guys might be sounding ignorant

2155.07 --> 2159.84
the April and April the first being

2158.1 --> 2163.98
April Fool's Day

2159.84 --> 2166.2000000000003
wasn't that a Christian thing kind of

2163.98 --> 2169.38
having a go at the the Jews for

2166.2 --> 2171.24
celebrating New Year's on April the 1st

2169.38 --> 2173.7000000000003
where everybody knew it was January 1st

2171.24 --> 2175.41
back then I'm running though well the

2173.7 --> 2177.54
Jews don't celebrate New Year's on the

2175.41 --> 2179.8799999999997
1st I mean see New Year's belongs at the

2177.54 --> 2182.25
spring solstice I mean that's that that

2179.88 --> 2183.63
would be the beginning of proper New

2182.25 --> 2190.35
Year I mean the middle of dead of winter

2183.63 --> 2192.6
is kind of ridiculous right and actually

2190.35 --> 2195.15
the Jewish New Year is this year it was

2192.6 --> 2196.89
around September oh it was 9/11 this

2195.15 --> 2201.1800000000003
year that was the Jewish New Year this

2196.89 --> 2202.83
year right so every year it would be

2201.18 --> 2204.8399999999997
different you know it's not gonna fall

2202.83 --> 2208.8199999999997
not gonna fall on the same day so you

2204.84 --> 2214.38
know we you know Valentine's Day is is

2208.82 --> 2218.1600000000003
you know February 14 but if it's the

2214.38 --> 2220.44
tenth month on the tenth day and you

2218.16 --> 2222.54
measure that by the moon's cycle it's

2220.44 --> 2225.84
gonna change every every year it's gonna

2222.54 --> 2228.12
be a different day but despite recycle

2225.84 --> 2230.73
what you base your measurement on so

2228.12 --> 2232.29
that's where you're consistent so that's

2230.73 --> 2235.02
where that's where I've really

2232.29 --> 2238.23
appreciated crow triple7 talking about

2235.02 --> 2241.14
how I mean cuz ok as a Christian Right

2238.23 --> 2246.7400000000002
the Christian I was raised to look at

2241.14 --> 2252.9
astronomy slash astrology with a

2246.74 --> 2254.9399999999996
critical eye and yet its nature right

2252.9 --> 2257.85
there's something in it there's

2254.94 --> 2260.339
something true about it and it wasn't

2257.85 --> 2261.779
until crow triple 7 that I

2260.339 --> 2263.609
I began to think differently about

2261.779 --> 2265.799
nature in that way and it just

2263.609 --> 2268.529
absolutely is fascinating yeah

2265.799 --> 2272.099
absolutely and you're right that as far

2268.529 --> 2273.93
as the proper day because uh if you look

2272.099 --> 2276.2690000000002
up in the moon anytime you see any kind

2273.93 --> 2278.069
of celebration with anything Hebrew the

2276.269 --> 2280.229
moon will always be in exactly the same

2278.069 --> 2281.759
place because they use it lunar calendar

2280.229 --> 2284.3999999999996
and the lunar calendar makes sense it's

2281.759 --> 2286.92
28 days and you could actually have 13

2284.4 --> 2288.809
months of twenty-eight days it's almost

2286.92 --> 2292.739
exactly a solar year it's off by a

2288.809 --> 2294.329
couple of days I think this is an

2292.739 --> 2297.869
account that we go by now that the glory

2294.329 --> 2301.4100000000003
in Canada as far as what to keep

2297.869 --> 2303.239
Gregorian calendar about what she goes

2301.41 --> 2306.1499999999996
by now is called the Gregorian calendars

2303.239 --> 2307.7690000000002
yeah it's it's it's another side up in

2306.15 --> 2312.4500000000003
my opinion create a plan and they're

2307.769 --> 2314.999
absolutely sister confuse as far as I

2312.45 --> 2316.5589999999997
can say yeah because every Glenda

2314.999 --> 2318.509
million the stars and the Sun but and

2316.559 --> 2320.759
tolerate tolerate with each other do

2318.509 --> 2322.619
they you've got 13 min cycles we've got

2320.759 --> 2325.469
12 months and you've got months of

2322.619 --> 2327.599
somewhere between on that 13 31 days

2325.469 --> 2329.16
apart from February so it's all off

2327.599 --> 2330.9
kilter it looks like the days and the

2329.16 --> 2333.0589999999997
months that we have down here don't have

2330.9 --> 2335.1600000000003
any Colorado correlation with the the

2333.059 --> 2337.44
patterns in the sky right in with the

2335.16 --> 2339.779
Hebrew tribes there actually were 12 and

2337.44 --> 2343.9500000000003
13 tribes there's 12 that you also throw

2339.779 --> 2345.39
in the Levites that makes 13 yeah and

2343.95 --> 2347.5389999999998
you can also cite out of Jesus and his

2345.39 --> 2350.009
twelve disciples in Jesus was dispensing

2347.539 --> 2352.17
absolutely absolutely and you can look

2350.009 --> 2354.719
the son of God and the Son of God you

2352.17 --> 2356.789
know so it's it could be astrological it

2354.719 --> 2360.42
could be literal it could be both like I

2356.789 --> 2362.7000000000003
said I don't make claims either way yeah

2360.42 --> 2364.2000000000003
that's where you're stretching my my

2362.7 --> 2366.45
comfort level although I'm not afraid of

2364.2 --> 2371.0389999999998
being stretched I I don't see the Son of

2366.45 --> 2372.779
God son of God play yet well just think

2371.039 --> 2374.5490000000004
about it people claim that that they

2372.779 --> 2376.829
have these near-death experiences and

2374.549 --> 2378.719
they see the light well just think about

2376.829 --> 2380.9990000000003
it if no one gets to the Father but

2378.719 --> 2383.969
through the Sun so there's that light

2380.999 --> 2385.799
there's God but I'm not saying it's true

2383.969 --> 2387.2690000000002
I'm just saying I'd look at I look at

2385.799 --> 2388.859
all these different things I find it's

2387.269 --> 2391.229
very amazing but I'm not making any

2388.859 --> 2393.719
claims I don't claim the Bible is not

2391.229 --> 2394.27
literal I don't claim Jesus isn't God I

2393.719 --> 2397.0
don't

2394.27 --> 2399.75
No and so I'm just making observations

2397.0 --> 2406.87
from my 60 years of study I studied the

2399.75 --> 2410.38
Scriptures for about 40 years I'd be

2406.87 --> 2413.5899999999997
interested what the light is that you

2410.38 --> 2416.4100000000003
get to see absolutely I'm not clear this

2413.59 --> 2420.55
couldn't be look I have experiences with

2416.41 --> 2423.8199999999997
like being out-of-body where time was

2420.55 --> 2425.59
basically not linear so if you get to

2423.82 --> 2427.9300000000003
see something it's not always quite

2425.59 --> 2429.9300000000003
obvious what that actually is

2427.93 --> 2432.8199999999997
things are counterintuitive sometimes

2429.93 --> 2440.1099999999997
then maybe if you see something it's

2432.82 --> 2442.51
actually your future spirits a path that

2440.11 --> 2445.57
you're ready seeing that is pulling you

2442.51 --> 2449.98
so maybe if you see a light when you die

2445.57 --> 2452.8900000000003
that is actually your spirit leaving and

2449.98 --> 2456.07
the energy released in that journey you

2452.89 --> 2459.8199999999997
get to see or then it could all like are

2456.07 --> 2462.4
you actually gonna do that or not or it

2459.82 --> 2464.0800000000004
could be the the hospital room passing

2462.4 --> 2466.21
through the mother's womb on to the next

2464.08 --> 2469.96
toe next thing because it says that no

2466.21 --> 2477.7
you must be born again what if that what

2469.96 --> 2481.45
if that was a reincarnation that's an

2477.7 --> 2485.02
amazing idea well that's what you wanna

2481.45 --> 2488.68
treat everyone a lot better yeah that's

2485.02 --> 2493.23
that's where I would disagree with with

2488.68 --> 2496.1499999999996
that passage of being born again but I

2493.23 --> 2498.58
mean it's a huge discussion for us to

2496.15 --> 2500.92
have but Jim I'd be interested if you if

2498.58 --> 2502.66
you want I've got a podcast on biblical

2500.92 --> 2504.46
interpretation

2502.66 --> 2506.68
I mean if they'd interest you at all you

2504.46 --> 2514.5
know jump on and see what you think it's

2506.68 --> 2516.91
called rethinking revelation calm yeah

2514.5 --> 2518.62
I'm always interested but what

2516.91 --> 2521.77
university might as well try this sorry

2518.62 --> 2524.56
I'll be nosy what a concept

2521.77 --> 2527.96
basically when it comes to biblical

2524.56 --> 2531.64
concept and reincarnation of

2527.96 --> 2535.1
well maybe each of your information is

2531.64 --> 2537.5899999999997
basically you your spirit so every time

2535.1 --> 2540.17
you reincarnate you get a new version

2537.59 --> 2543.71
new reflection of your spirit and then

2540.17 --> 2547.58
when you got again you can gather or dig

2543.71 --> 2550.4
into your old selves basically or

2547.58 --> 2552.65
communicate directly I don't know yes I

2550.4 --> 2555.02
don't exclude your reincarnation at all

2552.65 --> 2559.52
from the same concept that eventually

2555.02 --> 2562.07
there that is like the final States

2559.52 --> 2567.35
eventually when there is nothing more or

2562.07 --> 2568.9700000000003
less than that is the world just a

2567.35 --> 2570.74
science fiction kind of thought but what

2568.97 --> 2572.0299999999997
if you pass through reincarnation and

2570.74 --> 2573.74
reincarnation and your final

2572.03 --> 2576.2000000000003
reincarnation is where you play the

2573.74 --> 2578.06
Christ yesterday and then from that

2576.2 --> 2579.95
maybe you go on so it when you're the

2578.06 --> 2581.42
Christ you would tell people you must be

2579.95 --> 2582.83
born again because everyone except you

2581.42 --> 2584.48
everything that we born again but it's

2582.83 --> 2586.58
just I'm just playing around here I'm

2584.48 --> 2588.98
not getting excited and but I do look

2586.58 --> 2591.68
like well I do well I'm not sure about

2588.98 --> 2593.84
the literality literature literal

2591.68 --> 2597.7999999999997
meaning of the Bible or such I do look

2593.84 --> 2600.17
at the the spirit of Jesus and that was

2597.8 --> 2603.1400000000003
you know treat your enemies you know

2600.17 --> 2604.91
love your enemies and treat everyone the

2603.14 --> 2607.19
way you want to be treat I think if

2604.91 --> 2608.93
people would just follow that and not

2607.19 --> 2610.4900000000002
worry about the details I think we'd

2608.93 --> 2611.99
probably be a lot happier but you know

2610.49 --> 2614.2599999999998
maybe that's a satanic matter what

2611.99 --> 2617.18
everybody touches my class I would

2614.26 --> 2621.0200000000004
change the love your enemies into a

2617.18 --> 2622.7599999999998
respect your enemies well I think it's

2621.02 --> 2624.44
the same idea because you love your

2622.76 --> 2627.2900000000004
children if your children are screwing

2624.44 --> 2629.51
up doesn't necessarily that's different

2627.29 --> 2631.4
that's very different children I'm never

2629.51 --> 2634.9100000000003
really your enemies they can make you

2631.4 --> 2637.78
their enemies but yeah you can't do that

2634.91 --> 2640.31
as a parent so that's not the same but

2637.78 --> 2642.05
you know when you have enemies you

2640.31 --> 2645.92
shouldn't really love them got you

2642.05 --> 2649.88
should always and to refine to a sub you

2645.92 --> 2650.3
should always respect them never never

2649.88 --> 2653.62
never

2650.3 --> 2656.92
aggravating if you can prevent it and

2653.62 --> 2660.17
always keep in mind that day the

2656.92 --> 2660.88
hostilities could end and strive towards

2660.17 --> 2664.089
that

2660.88 --> 2666.88
yeah and they could turn into a

2664.089 --> 2669.19
potential ally or a friend or yeah and

2666.88 --> 2671.4100000000003
if you don't aggravate things that will

2669.19 --> 2674.759
that relation that could come out of the

2671.41 --> 2679.72
blue also be more more higher-quality

2674.759 --> 2687.819
with less risk so to love your enemy in

2679.72 --> 2690.609
the literal sense but I think if you're

2687.819 --> 2692.499
I think if you're just being proper to

2690.609 --> 2693.999
any everybody you're loving them whether

2692.499 --> 2694.93
or not they like it or not that's a

2693.999 --> 2697.45
different story

2694.93 --> 2699.94
as far as children as far as children go

2697.45 --> 2702.249
I as from 60 years I decided that as a

2699.94 --> 2703.7200000000003
agent of my children and considering

2702.249 --> 2706.1189999999997
this place I decided it wouldn't be

2703.72 --> 2709.749
property to bring my agents into this

2706.119 --> 2711.7000000000003
realm the way it is and looking looking

2709.749 --> 2714.3089999999997
back at Jesus you'll notice that the 12

2711.7 --> 2716.109
disciples that I believe only one of

2714.309 --> 2717.6400000000003
them was married and so did none of them

2716.109 --> 2720.279
had children so another very interesting

2717.64 --> 2724.93
thing because Jesus seems to have been

2720.279 --> 2726.609
ignoring the order in Genesis to go

2724.93 --> 2731.3799999999997
forth and multiply the same way of

2726.609 --> 2732.7
course I've ignored that as well well

2731.38 --> 2734.71
I'm not really sure I would draw that

2732.7 --> 2737.739
conclusion simply because the Bible

2734.71 --> 2739.539
doesn't say they were married or had

2737.739 --> 2742.029
children it doesn't mean that they

2739.539 --> 2743.71
didn't that's that's where I would stand

2742.029 --> 2745.509
on that hold on well forth and

2743.71 --> 2748.359
multiplying it does that automatically

2745.509 --> 2751.239
imply go forth and multiply

2748.359 --> 2754.93
forever until everything is completely

2751.239 --> 2757.839
destroyed and people are gonna end up

2754.93 --> 2761.259
each other no that was in that moment

2757.839 --> 2764.769
was it like an eternal declaration of

2761.259 --> 2766.809
the fate of mankind I don't think that's

2764.769 --> 2768.999
a very good just a moment it was just

2766.809 --> 2770.9500000000003
like hey you're going out you need to

2768.999 --> 2772.4199999999996
multiply and I know that's weird to you

2770.95 --> 2773.89
because you've never done that before

2772.42 --> 2777.4
but you're physical now you're gonna

2773.89 --> 2780.45
have to do right well but see also

2777.4 --> 2780.4500000000003
consider that Paul

2781.049 --> 2790.329
presented his going forth and

2784.93 --> 2792.999
multiplying as a result of the preaching

2790.329 --> 2795.03
of the gospel so he calls Timothy his

2792.999 --> 2799.45
child

2795.03 --> 2802.4500000000003
he refers to Timothy as his child well

2799.45 --> 2805.8999999999996
Timothy wasn't his his biological child

2802.45 --> 2808.06
so you know I I mean I appreciate the

2805.9 --> 2812.6800000000003
discussions that we can have along these

2808.06 --> 2815.98
lines we just have to I think be willing

2812.68 --> 2817.69
to step back a little bit and see the

2815.98 --> 2820.2400000000002
way the Bible speaks so even though we

2817.69 --> 2822.52
are talking about biological going forth

2820.24 --> 2825.4599999999996
and multiplying you know biologically

2822.52 --> 2827.29
the Bible also all I believe looks at

2825.46 --> 2830.85
that from a spiritual vantage point that

2827.29 --> 2833.71
is that you can have children by

2830.85 --> 2838.0
conversion as well yeah adoption moves

2833.71 --> 2839.4700000000003
me that's a good point Travis it's the

2838.0 --> 2841.51
way that we read the Bible and why this

2839.47 --> 2843.7
interpreted it's on many different

2841.51 --> 2845.26
levels so you can have one meaning for

2843.7 --> 2849.9399999999996
one thing but on a deeper level would

2845.26 --> 2852.4300000000003
mean something very esoteric right but

2849.94 --> 2855.07
the esoteric aspect isn't you know isn't

2852.43 --> 2858.2799999999997
willy nilly it's not it's it's based on

2855.07 --> 2859.9300000000003
so this is where I get into sorry it's

2858.28 --> 2862.9900000000002
definitely not waiting nearly sorry Mike

2859.93 --> 2867.73
yeah yeah I mean it's it's structured it

2862.99 --> 2870.04
has a structure to it so this is the way

2867.73 --> 2872.02
I if I were to teach on interpreting the

2870.04 --> 2873.46
Bible this is one thing that I would say

2872.02 --> 2875.08
that the Bible is written in three

2873.46 --> 2879.67
different languages originally Greek

2875.08 --> 2881.92
Hebrew and Aramaic but those three

2879.67 --> 2889.02
languages are subservient to a higher

2881.92 --> 2892.36
language that is poetic or symbolic yes

2889.02 --> 2895.9
so that the way that we understand say

2892.36 --> 2898.42
for instance the Greek the New Testament

2895.9 --> 2900.13
came after the Old Testament so if we

2898.42 --> 2901.2400000000002
just read the New Testament without

2900.13 --> 2902.92
being familiar with the Old Testament

2901.24 --> 2905.5899999999997
we're not going to understand the way

2902.92 --> 2907.42
the New Testament speaks because the way

2905.59 --> 2912.1600000000003
the New Testament speaks is based upon

2907.42 --> 2913.96
the Old Testament yeah so so if you

2912.16 --> 2916.06
understand that then the the Greek text

2913.96 --> 2919.7200000000003
is then subservient to the Hebrew text

2916.06 --> 2924.7599999999998
but the Hebrew text speaks poetically it

2919.72 --> 2927.73
speaks symbolically and if we don't if

2924.76 --> 2930.4
we don't understand that

2927.73 --> 2932.26
not going to understand certain well not

2930.4 --> 2934.21
certain things practically everything so

2932.26 --> 2937.1800000000003
for instance going back to when Jesus

2934.21 --> 2939.9700000000003
says you must be born again if you look

2937.18 --> 2942.5499999999997
at different translations those

2939.97 --> 2949.1189999999997
translations which try to give you a

2942.55 --> 2955.6600000000003
more concrete translation it's you must

2949.119 --> 2960.04
be born from above haha okay

2955.66 --> 2962.14
so wake up in your spiritual senses so

2960.04 --> 2964.54
the thing that we need to look at that

2962.14 --> 2967.15
in John chapter 3 that Jesus correlates

2964.54 --> 2972.16
two things whether he correlates water

2967.15 --> 2975.19
and he correlates spirit or breath or

2972.16 --> 2978.99
wind because the greek word for spirit

2975.19 --> 2984.43
breath and wind is the same word ooh

2978.99 --> 2986.3199999999997
okay I would again if you listen to my

2984.43 --> 2989.0499999999997
podcast you're gonna hear me harp and

2986.32 --> 2992.98
harp and harp on translation I am of the

2989.05 --> 2997.03
mind that we should not soften the the

2992.98 --> 3000.84
Bible's text so that I wouldn't I would

2997.03 --> 3003.869
say being born again is not a strong

3000.84 --> 3006.3
translation it's just trying to

3003.869 --> 3008.13
communicate an idea let's say well let's

3006.3 --> 3009.869
say it's born from above people aren't

3008.13 --> 3014.67
really gonna understand that but they'll

3009.869 --> 3017.3
understand born again you know so I tend

3014.67 --> 3020.79
to try to give people stronger drink

3017.3 --> 3022.8300000000004
because I think they can handle it but

3020.79 --> 3026.82
some but all of that this day being born

3022.83 --> 3029.22
from above and then Jesus chastises

3026.82 --> 3031.8300000000004
Nicodemus because Nicodemus says what

3029.22 --> 3033.8399999999997
are you talking about okay how is this

3031.83 --> 3035.4
gonna happen and Jesus says aren't you a

3033.84 --> 3038.6400000000003
teacher of Israel you don't know what

3035.4 --> 3040.02
I'm talking about and so if we go back

3038.64 --> 3044.16
to the Old Testament

3040.02 --> 3048.93
The Book of Ezekiel links the new thing

3044.16 --> 3055.08
that's coming about in the end is the

3048.93 --> 3057.6299999999997
spirit and water and renewal so Jesus is

3055.08 --> 3059.4
you know making a connection there for

3057.63 --> 3061.5
big Adiemus and Nicodemus isn't isn't

3059.4 --> 3063.81
following know

3061.5 --> 3066.33
why do you suppose nothing was written

3063.81 --> 3070.92
for the first 50 years after the

3066.33 --> 3072.42
supposed Jesus it we don't say that the

3070.92 --> 3074.64
scriptures were actually written until

3072.42 --> 3077.2200000000003
at least 50 and the Gospels themselves

3074.64 --> 3078.69
until later than that now we don't have

3077.22 --> 3082.2599999999998
any evidence of that that's all

3078.69 --> 3084.06
speculate it's all speculation as to is

3082.26 --> 3084.69
as to any time that it was written we

3084.06 --> 3087.81
don't know

3084.69 --> 3089.58
sure yeah yeah right but I would assume

3087.81 --> 3091.41
then because of the culture that they

3089.58 --> 3092.88
were in they were people of the book

3091.41 --> 3096.24
they would have written these things

3092.88 --> 3097.4700000000003
down pretty much the next week and then

3096.24 --> 3099.54
why would they have been written in

3097.47 --> 3103.1699999999996
Hebrew and Greek and not Aramaic or

3099.54 --> 3108.72
Hebrew because of the culture that they

3103.17 --> 3111.27
were in they were Helen I so that common

3108.72 --> 3114.06
grace if you think about it right so the

3111.27 --> 3116.25
the New Testament motif it's its theme

3114.06 --> 3119.13
was that the gospel would go out to the

3116.25 --> 3121.109
nations and the nations were Hellenized

3119.13 --> 3123.7200000000003
and the greet and it's almost like

3121.109 --> 3125.0099999999998
English it would be like if you know in

3123.72 --> 3126.5699999999997
the first century of English was the

3125.01 --> 3128.369
predominant language and you would then

3126.57 --> 3131.5800000000004
write if you wanted to communicate to

3128.369 --> 3133.53
people who were of your nationality but

3131.58 --> 3135.5989999999997
they were three or four countries away

3133.53 --> 3137.4500000000003
but that country spoke English well

3135.599 --> 3139.8590000000004
you're not gonna write to them in Hebrew

3137.45 --> 3142.2
right I would since what you would

3139.859 --> 3144.119
expected since all of these folks were

3142.2 --> 3146.97
Hebrew and certainly Paul claimed to be

3144.119 --> 3148.9500000000003
a Pharisee that you would find Hebrew

3146.97 --> 3152.0099999999998
notes at least and yet we find nothing

3148.95 --> 3153.2999999999997
like that I suppose I would I would

3152.01 --> 3155.1600000000003
bounce back and say that's an argument

3153.3 --> 3157.1090000000004
from Silence all we can do is say what

3155.16 --> 3158.67
we have that's this is what we have why

3157.109 --> 3160.5
don't we have the Hebrew why doesn't why

3158.67 --> 3161.9700000000003
wasn't the New Testament written and why

3160.5 --> 3165.99
was this totally controlled by the

3161.97 --> 3169.14
Catholic Church for all this time maybe

3165.99 --> 3171.66
they still have it it's damning to them

3169.14 --> 3176.04
well you know some what they got a

3171.66 --> 3178.7999999999997
library huge huge fight within the

3176.04 --> 3180.3
destroy words of knowledge and they

3178.8 --> 3183.0600000000004
destroyed the library at Alexandria

3180.3 --> 3185.1600000000003
which was the greatest library that ever

3183.06 --> 3189.42
was so why did they why did they go out

3185.16 --> 3191.8489999999997
and destroy that be by that history do

3189.42 --> 3193.4700000000003
you think they destroyed that write

3191.849 --> 3194.65
rewrite the history and create a new

3193.47 --> 3197.83
calendar and then

3194.65 --> 3200.9500000000003
who knows it's right create a new

3197.83 --> 3204.85
religion basically the kind of hijacking

3200.95 --> 3207.8199999999997
of Christos the the Jewish Messiah and

3204.85 --> 3209.65
and taking that forward and bring I

3207.82 --> 3211.1800000000003
think they brought a lot of pagan idea

3209.65 --> 3214.65
well they did bring a lot a turn ideas

3211.18 --> 3219.16
into the Christianity that they hijacked

3214.65 --> 3222.61
my opinon does way yeah we see the we

3219.16 --> 3225.16
see this born I'm a virgin a number of

3222.61 --> 3227.65
times before Jesus I mean myth rose and

3225.16 --> 3229.54
and actually folks before that and even

3227.65 --> 3231.4300000000003
if we look in the scriptures and we look

3229.54 --> 3234.0099999999998
at Strong's Concordance which I have

3231.43 --> 3235.7799999999997
which which is a way to look at it's a

3234.01 --> 3238.51
way to look at your Greek in your Hebrew

3235.78 --> 3240.7900000000004
you'll see that in the in the Old

3238.51 --> 3243.7000000000003
Testament the Messiah was supposed to be

3240.79 --> 3245.44
called Emmanuel but we don't see that

3243.7 --> 3246.9399999999996
anywhere here and then also he was

3245.44 --> 3248.9500000000003
supposed to have been born not of a

3246.94 --> 3251.4900000000002
virgin but of a maid in which is a

3248.95 --> 3255.2799999999997
different just means a young woman right

3251.49 --> 3262.0899999999997
so now we're gonna get into my eye field

3255.28 --> 3264.4
and the the connotation of maiden is you

3262.09 --> 3267.03
eat the denotation rather okay the

3264.4 --> 3272.53
denotation of the hebrew word alma is

3267.03 --> 3274.2400000000002
first of all it's female and so then you

3272.53 --> 3276.9900000000002
can say well what kind of female is it a

3274.24 --> 3279.9399999999996
aged female is that a young female

3276.99 --> 3283.4199999999996
maiden okay so maiden has a connotation

3279.94 --> 3285.9700000000003
to it so it all depends on the context

3283.42 --> 3288.73
so in Isaiah chapter 7 the passage it

3285.97 --> 3292.72
are you referring to Jim that that

3288.73 --> 3295.03
prophecy that Isaiah gave was fulfilled

3292.72 --> 3299.8599999999997
within the next year because the

3295.03 --> 3302.5600000000004
prophecy of the maiden giving birth was

3299.86 --> 3305.1400000000003
Isaiah's own wife I mean if you just

3302.56 --> 3309.7599999999998
read the next chapter it it shows you

3305.14 --> 3312.9
that so the idea that gets picked up in

3309.76 --> 3317.9500000000003
the New Testament is that the greater

3312.9 --> 3319.78
fulfillment of that is Jesus so what

3317.95 --> 3320.5
kind of maiden are we talking about is

3319.78 --> 3322.69
she married

3320.5 --> 3327.79
no well if she's not married then the

3322.69 --> 3329.2000000000003
implication is she's a virgin but when

3327.79 --> 3331.69
you get to the new

3329.2 --> 3335.89
the word that we have in the Greek is

3331.69 --> 3337.089
more specifically virgin those things

3335.89 --> 3339.2799999999997
you have to think about as you look good

3337.089 --> 3341.7599999999998
I think I think we're about time to

3339.28 --> 3345.94
switch over to the other two nations

3341.76 --> 3349.1800000000003
channels my judgments but yeah that we

3345.94 --> 3352.54
got like two three more minutes and then

3349.18 --> 3354.04
I'm gonna round it out and if you need

3352.54 --> 3355.69
any more spikes on the panel for that

3354.04 --> 3357.97
oven give me a shout or not jump in if

3355.69 --> 3359.619
you want oh it's nice and one sorry well

3357.97 --> 3363.1299999999997
I'll be back tomorrow

3359.619 --> 3365.2000000000003
so yep guys do come again it's been

3363.13 --> 3368.4700000000003
extremely interesting I love this in

3365.2 --> 3369.79
depth of bible discretion type stuff so

3368.47 --> 3373.0299999999997
yeah I love it

3369.79 --> 3375.0099999999998
nope no problem come join my channel if

3373.03 --> 3378.67
you want later on and I'm happy to talk

3375.01 --> 3380.71
about that stuff key they're not I've

3378.67 --> 3382.81
got a long history with Christianity I

3380.71 --> 3384.67
was born again when I was 19 and I used

3382.81 --> 3387.2799999999997
to be on the youth program and go around

3384.67 --> 3389.05
to schools and teach the gospel so I got

3387.28 --> 3391.869
a little bit of understanding about it

3389.05 --> 3394.8100000000004
but I haven't been to church like 18

3391.869 --> 3397.869
years me too my friend I was a I was a

3394.81 --> 3399.43
born-again Baptist at age 27 and I've

3397.869 --> 3401.109
gone to many churches and then he

3399.43 --> 3402.8799999999997
actually became the Jehovah's Witness

3401.109 --> 3405.52
and then actually a Bible student which

3402.88 --> 3407.9500000000003
is a group that has existed for a very

3405.52 --> 3409.69
long time but right now I'm just not

3407.95 --> 3411.31
completely sold on the idea but I'm not

3409.69 --> 3413.26
against it either so I don't I don't

3411.31 --> 3415.2999999999997
deny anything some people get all

3413.26 --> 3418.3590000000004
excited about what I say and oh you're

3415.3 --> 3420.25
denying this no I'm not I'm just I'm

3418.359 --> 3423.2799999999997
just discussing basically what goes on

3420.25 --> 3426.28
in my head and if that sends me to hell

3423.28 --> 3431.8590000000004
