83.68 --> 87.119
huh

84.56 --> 90.24000000000001
literally just now as i started the show

87.119 --> 90.24
the sun broke through

90.799 --> 93.52000000000001
this is nice

94.159 --> 99.68
it's been very restless

97.119 --> 102.24
over the night as well i was like really

99.68 --> 106.0
restless also in the middle of the night

102.24 --> 110.0
to literally calm myself down

106.0 --> 110.0
from just being kind of nervous

110.079 --> 116.479
like at three o'clock at night it's very

112.88 --> 118.96
weird sensation to notice that about

116.479 --> 121.119
about yourself

118.96 --> 123.119
that late

121.119 --> 125.36
but yeah

123.119 --> 127.36
the wind has been rushing by a lot but

125.36 --> 130.47899999999998
right now there's a bit of sun coming

127.36 --> 130.479
through i had a walk

131.12 --> 134.239
outside

132.4 --> 136.31900000000002
in the usual route

134.239 --> 138.64000000000001
before this

136.319 --> 140.64
because i yeah i felt really nervous and

138.64 --> 142.39999999999998
all that

140.64 --> 144.95899999999997
i thought like oh no i'm not gonna be

142.4 --> 147.68
sick again am i but yeah the walk really

144.959 --> 147.68
did the trick

149.2 --> 155.959
and i wasn't alone again like tons of

151.44 --> 155.959
people but then again it is sundays

157.04 --> 161.04
yeah

158.64 --> 162.319
it's an interesting type of clouds and

161.04 --> 164.79999999999998
seriously

162.319 --> 168.07999999999998
especially this morning there were just

164.8 --> 170.16000000000003
cloud banks rushing by so unbelievably

168.08 --> 172.959
fast

170.16 --> 176.16
i was actually gonna make a coriolis

172.959 --> 178.64000000000001
deviation joke they were going that fast

176.16 --> 178.64
serious

179.2 --> 182.95899999999997
like

180.56 --> 186.92000000000002
even in this still picture you can see

182.959 --> 186.92000000000002
how fast that is

203.28 --> 209.76
all right going to the left

206.48 --> 209.76
see how fast that is

211.44 --> 216.799
oh it was going like at least twice as

214.0 --> 216.799
fast as this

220.08 --> 227.15900000000002
but yeah it's still rushing by up there

224.159 --> 227.159
huh

230.159 --> 236.39999999999998
nice to have a bit of some

232.799 --> 238.72
hello jeff gassett first in chat elise g

236.4 --> 241.20000000000002
good to see you

238.72 --> 245.799
it is sunday

241.2 --> 245.79899999999998
the 2nd of january 2022.

249.36 --> 255.18900000000002
the temperature

252.08 --> 255.18900000000002
[Music]

258.32 --> 261.199
13 degrees

264.16 --> 269.84000000000003
yeah that winter dip we had around

266.479 --> 272.24
christmas that like totally

269.84 --> 274.63899999999995
went back up

272.24 --> 277.639
and it's kind of mild now has been for a

274.639 --> 277.639
while

284.91 --> 288.089
[Applause]

292.32 --> 298.0
right yeah walking outside also paid a

295.12 --> 299.759
lot of the attention to birds

298.0 --> 301.6
because yeah they get a real big

299.759 --> 303.68
punishment pretty much

301.6 --> 305.52000000000004
stress wise

303.68 --> 306.88
new year's eve

305.52 --> 309.19899999999996
but

306.88 --> 312.71999999999997
there's like tons of birds still around

309.199 --> 315.199
like there's still the flock of geese

312.72 --> 317.52000000000004
are still there or was it a cackle of

315.199 --> 317.52000000000004
geese

321.199 --> 325.36
yeah they're still out there seagulls

323.12 --> 327.919
while they they fly all over the place

325.36 --> 331.199
they're actually coast birds just

327.919 --> 335.52
scavenging in the lands

331.199 --> 335.52000000000004
and i even bumped into a little robin

336.4 --> 339.28
like

337.28 --> 341.039
was two meters away it was just like

339.28 --> 344.08
sitting there looking at me and i was

341.039 --> 346.71999999999997
like oh oh you're not gonna fly away

344.08 --> 350.08
oh he was like nope

346.72 --> 353.44000000000005
just sitting there staring at you

350.08 --> 354.56
that was really cute

353.44 --> 356.479
plenty of

354.56 --> 359.68
a lot of crows and magpies were

356.479 --> 361.52
bickering back and forth

359.68 --> 364.88
usually they kind of leave each other

361.52 --> 367.52
alone but like they were really like

364.88 --> 369.36
starting to nag each other i noticed

367.52 --> 371.75899999999996
kind of like a turf war going or

369.36 --> 371.759
something

373.36 --> 380.319
anyway yeah

376.16 --> 382.47900000000004
nature survived it once again

380.319 --> 386.319
and it was just great

382.479 --> 386.31899999999996
hearing all the birds everywhere and

388.4 --> 392.88
i really like that flock of geese or

390.96 --> 394.88
kakaluki's what is it how do you

392.88 --> 397.68
designate geese

394.88 --> 397.68
i thought it was a

400.24 --> 406.16
yeah it is a cackle of witches and a

403.199 --> 406.16
cackle of geese

407.44 --> 409.84
right

415.759 --> 418.8
yeah it is a gecko

420.8 --> 427.68
and they cackle oh yeah

424.319 --> 430.0
man those creatures can make such an

427.68 --> 432.319
amount of sound

430.0 --> 432.319
ah

432.4 --> 436.479
like really loud

435.28 --> 439.039
like

436.479 --> 440.0
car honking loud

439.039 --> 442.56
is

440.0 --> 442.56
incredible

446.88 --> 450.8
and they're also kind of very

448.8 --> 452.24
territorial guarding

450.8 --> 454.56
for each other it's like always these

452.24 --> 455.919
geese at the edge of the flock or the

454.56 --> 458.8
cackle

455.919 --> 459.75899999999996
the gaggle gaggle

458.8 --> 461.68
huh

459.759 --> 463.44
whatever the geese and they're always

461.68 --> 464.879
like looking around if nobody's coming

463.44 --> 468.16
too close

464.879 --> 469.59900000000005
and then they pose up to you if you do

468.16 --> 472.72
if you approach

469.599 --> 474.56
start honking i know how to honk back

472.72 --> 477.44000000000005
and they're basically giving them

474.56 --> 478.479
recognition to their territory

477.44 --> 480.879
so

478.479 --> 482.31899999999996
yeah i'm sorry guys i like communicating

480.879 --> 484.0
with animals

482.319 --> 487.03900000000004
just do

484.0 --> 490.16
with with crows with magpies do it with

487.039 --> 490.15999999999997
these most creatures

490.8 --> 493.8
uh

495.36 --> 500.08000000000004
hello crockett by the way adam meekin

497.44 --> 500.08
good to see you

500.879 --> 511.16
is it is it a gaggle geese

503.77 --> 511.15999999999997
[Applause]

516.32 --> 520.0
apparently

517.919 --> 522.399
you could call it both a cackle and a

520.0 --> 522.399
gaggle

522.719 --> 525.9590000000001
a cow

546.88 --> 550.72
what it's actually called a barrel of

549.519 --> 552.32
monkeys

550.72 --> 556.0
what

552.32 --> 556.0
all monkeys come in barrels

560.16 --> 566.8
who came up with all this

562.959 --> 569.68
a congress of baboons

566.8 --> 569.68
really is

570.24 --> 574.08
yeah i'm just watching this silly list

575.519 --> 580.0
just some random website

578.0 --> 582.32
but yeah it's funny

580.0 --> 586.519
it's actually called a congress of

582.32 --> 586.519
baboons that is so fitting

593.279 --> 599.32
what's the difference between the gaga

595.279 --> 599.32
leggies and the floor cookies

615.6 --> 621.279
a group

616.839 --> 621.2790000000001
flying is called a skein

623.6 --> 627.76
right and flock is more generic for

626.24 --> 630.399
birds

627.76 --> 633.6
fascinating

630.399 --> 637.2
that's so funny so the gaggle

633.6 --> 639.279
is actually a terminology

637.2 --> 642.24
to basically indicate like a

639.279 --> 643.92
a yeah a bunch of old women and how they

642.24 --> 647.839
behave

643.92 --> 647.8389999999999
that's so funny

649.2 --> 651.76
and weird

657.839 --> 663.6800000000001
right so i guess that in my case since

659.839 --> 667.7600000000001
they're like sitting there and being ah

663.68 --> 669.4399999999999
yeah that would be a gaggle of geese

667.76 --> 672.399
and if they're like

669.44 --> 674.24
all kinds of birds like when somebody's

672.399 --> 677.36
silly enough to start feeding them and

674.24 --> 680.0790000000001
then like seriously like a frenzy i've

677.36 --> 681.76
seen people falling over because birds

680.079 --> 685.279
were jumping up against them while they

681.76 --> 685.279
were trying to feed them over there

686.16 --> 689.8389999999999
cluster [ __ ] of ballers

713.6 --> 717.639
yeah let me think about that

730.24 --> 733.279
hello adam price

737.519 --> 744.68
what do they sound like again i'm sorry

739.76 --> 744.68
i i don't make sounds on command

751.2 --> 755.519
and besides like

753.04 --> 759.68
look there's this trick about

755.519 --> 761.68
emulating birds right auditory

759.68 --> 763.1999999999999
it's not about

761.68 --> 765.1999999999999
like

763.2 --> 767.76
the level of the sound

765.2 --> 769.519
like it's not about like your vocal

767.76 --> 773.36
chords or even what kind of sound it

769.519 --> 775.92
makes it's only about the inflections

773.36 --> 779.279
with birds it's only about that and

775.92 --> 779.279
getting the tone height

779.36 --> 782.8000000000001
getting it right it's the only thing

781.279 --> 784.639
that they actually respond to i've

782.8 --> 786.16
noticed this

784.639 --> 789.2
because when i was younger i was always

786.16 --> 791.92
trying to like perfectly mimic the sound

789.2 --> 794.48
like make it exactly sound like that

791.92 --> 796.16
i've noticed that

794.48 --> 800.0
yeah birds

796.16 --> 801.76
they they're it's just like a language

800.0 --> 803.92
right just because they have very

801.76 --> 806.48
specific type of vocal chords it will

803.92 --> 809.279
allow them a certain range

806.48 --> 813.639
of sound effects but it's more just like

809.279 --> 813.639
with language about the

814.48 --> 820.16
like the inflections and the patterns

818.0 --> 822.32
and how much how much

820.16 --> 823.279
energy you put into it like do you

822.32 --> 826.1600000000001
really

823.279 --> 829.6
make a vivid movement while you make the

826.16 --> 832.079
sound or something right that's that's

829.6 --> 834.88
how birds communicate

832.079 --> 834.88
from what i've seen

836.959 --> 842.279
there are what's a lot of trolls called

839.279 --> 842.279
guys

844.88 --> 849.279
i think it's called a pita trolls

849.519 --> 855.5600000000001
and if it isn't it should be it should

851.44 --> 855.5600000000001
be called the pit of trolls

856.959 --> 861.56
hello john m truth good to see you

873.6 --> 877.1990000000001
right by the way adam meek and i think

875.12 --> 879.6
that ballers would probably prefer if

877.199 --> 880.639
you would call them a constellation of

879.6 --> 884.12
ballers

880.639 --> 884.12
wouldn't you say

885.58 --> 888.659
[Music]

889.6 --> 897.0790000000001
and of course a plate of flat earthers

894.079 --> 897.079
ah

902.639 --> 905.44
yeah but

903.76 --> 907.92
when it comes to trolls it's definitely

905.44 --> 910.8800000000001
a pit of trolls

907.92 --> 913.8389999999999
a cluster of ballers and a plate of flat

910.88 --> 913.8389999999999
earthers

917.519 --> 920.48
what do you guys say

920.639 --> 924.5600000000001
an orbit of yeah i thought of that but

922.48 --> 927.6
an orbit isn't really

924.56 --> 930.88
even an indication of like a grouping

927.6 --> 930.88
it's more like a motion

931.199 --> 935.4399999999999
but if you say cluster then it would

933.199 --> 935.4399999999999
work

936.56 --> 944.0
a stupid a flute oh you're so smart

940.24 --> 946.399
you're so smart oh trolly boy

944.0 --> 947.44
how creative of you man

946.399 --> 948.72
so

947.44 --> 950.8800000000001
smart

948.72 --> 953.6800000000001
i mean as an anti-flat earther that

950.88 --> 956.32
makes you look so incredibly genius

953.68 --> 956.3199999999999
saying that

956.399 --> 962.079
you feel it you feel how smart you sound

960.079 --> 964.079
i bet you did because you just retracted

962.079 --> 966.399
the message

964.079 --> 970.56
so yeah how does it feel to have

966.399 --> 972.959
something incredibly dumb and uncreative

970.56 --> 976.0
proving you don't get what the [ __ ] is

972.959 --> 979.04
going on coming out of you then feeling

976.0 --> 981.279
forced to retract it by sheer personal

979.04 --> 982.3199999999999
embarrassment how does it feel

981.279 --> 986.399
glo

982.32 --> 989.6800000000001
gruelska frandor

986.399 --> 991.839
some random name generator name

989.68 --> 994.399
how does it feel to feel like a [ __ ]

991.839 --> 997.44
[ __ ]

994.399 --> 1001.44
how does it feel huh

997.44 --> 1004.0790000000001
no it's a plate of flat earthers

1001.44 --> 1005.12
a plate of fluffers

1004.079 --> 1009.279
just

1005.12 --> 1013.92
like it's a constellation of ballers

1009.279 --> 1013.92
it's set now it's officially registered

1018.24 --> 1023.6800000000001
you tell us yeah i am telling you i'm

1020.8 --> 1026.319
telling you you're a [ __ ] and you're

1023.68 --> 1029.6789999999999
extremely uncreative to say something

1026.319 --> 1032.1599999999999
like that is so lame

1029.679 --> 1032.16
and just

1032.72 --> 1036.799
there's nothing there

1034.319 --> 1038.959
like why do you even say anything if

1036.799 --> 1042.72
something that lame is gonna come out of

1038.959 --> 1046.799
you what you think you're winning

1042.72 --> 1046.799
by saying something that stupid

1047.919 --> 1053.8400000000001
they don't know a pit of trolls it's a

1049.919 --> 1053.8400000000001
pit they're always in the pit

1056.559 --> 1061.52
right they always sink to the lowest

1059.36 --> 1063.12
point and so they end up just walking

1061.52 --> 1063.9189999999999
around in a pit

1063.12 --> 1066.1599999999999
right

1063.919 --> 1068.24
that's why pit traps work so well on

1066.16 --> 1071.3600000000001
trolls because they always

1068.24 --> 1073.1200000000001
fall down to the lower levels they can't

1071.36 --> 1076.3999999999999
help themselves

1073.12 --> 1076.3999999999999
so it's a pit of trolls

1079.44 --> 1084.3200000000002
yeah jeff gassett you're

1081.679 --> 1086.48
now you're lowering yourself in their

1084.32 --> 1089.9189999999999
pita trolls

1086.48 --> 1091.919
by making a similar uncreative

1089.919 --> 1094.0
grouping name this

1091.919 --> 1096.48
don't do that

1094.0 --> 1098.48
right you'll just end up in the pit with

1096.48 --> 1100.64
the trolls

1098.48 --> 1103.039
before you know it you're one of them

1100.64 --> 1104.96
don't do it

1103.039 --> 1107.679
never sink to their level never fall

1104.96 --> 1109.919
into their pit

1107.679 --> 1112.799
right because the pit

1109.919 --> 1115.2800000000002
was made not by trolls

1112.799 --> 1116.08
but they always end up in

1115.28 --> 1118.559
it

1116.08 --> 1120.08
and then claim it like trolls claim

1118.559 --> 1123.039
anything that's within their hands

1120.08 --> 1125.84
reaches right so yeah it's always their

1123.039 --> 1130.0
pit even though they never made the pit

1125.84 --> 1130.0
a sock of trolls that's hilarious

1132.48 --> 1137.84
weird but hilarious i'm still gonna go

1135.2 --> 1137.8400000000001
with pit

1140.64 --> 1145.679
the pit from 300

1142.73 --> 1149.799
[Music]

1145.679 --> 1149.799
harsh but fair

1150.64 --> 1154.1200000000001
oh [ __ ]

1173.84 --> 1180.799
now the the pit of trolls is basically a

1176.72 --> 1180.799
reference to like a bucket of crabs

1181.919 --> 1185.44
i don't even think that crabs are

1183.84 --> 1188.24
classified

1185.44 --> 1190.559
their groups as in buckets but that's

1188.24 --> 1191.6
like what everybody knows crabs before

1190.559 --> 1195.48
now

1191.6 --> 1195.48
for their bucket behavior

1215.52 --> 1219.039
but i mean

1218.08 --> 1221.84
is it

1219.039 --> 1221.84
a talent

1223.36 --> 1228.0
like this is like a philosophical

1225.36 --> 1230.7199999999998
question is it a talent

1228.0 --> 1233.039
to be that lame

1230.72 --> 1235.84
to be that uncreative

1233.039 --> 1240.24
persistently and not funny

1235.84 --> 1240.24
even though you're trying to distract

1241.039 --> 1245.76
like what's better

1242.799 --> 1248.559
to distract the situation right like

1245.76 --> 1250.96
what a trolls actually designated to do

1248.559 --> 1253.44
to distract the way

1250.96 --> 1255.8400000000001
what if they're just really bad at it

1253.44 --> 1258.799
because they have no creativity

1255.84 --> 1260.799
they don't have any spirit

1258.799 --> 1264.48
they don't know what's funny

1260.799 --> 1264.48
they just think everything is lame

1272.48 --> 1278.0
it's like you can't get angry at that

1276.0 --> 1280.64
it's almost like a tragedy trolls a

1278.0 --> 1284.32
troll that sucks so much

1280.64 --> 1286.96
you are literally forced to feel some

1284.32 --> 1290.32
level of sympathy for them because oh my

1286.96 --> 1291.039
god can you imagine being that guy it's

1290.32 --> 1293.039
like

1291.039 --> 1295.44
one of the saddest

1293.039 --> 1298.64
persons in the world

1295.44 --> 1302.96
like that's genuine tragedy like oh my

1298.64 --> 1305.5200000000002
god can you imagine ending up a troll

1302.96 --> 1308.72
an internet troll that's a guy that's an

1305.52 --> 1311.36
actual person there can you imagine

1308.72 --> 1312.72
actually being somebody like that

1311.36 --> 1316.24
that's horror

1312.72 --> 1316.24
that's genuine horror

1317.44 --> 1320.64
when you say

1319.84 --> 1323.039
right

1320.64 --> 1325.2800000000002
so they come here oh my god

1323.039 --> 1326.72
flat earthers are worse

1325.28 --> 1329.039
we're gonna nag them because they're

1326.72 --> 1330.88
flat earthers they're worse

1329.039 --> 1334.24
well no

1330.88 --> 1334.24
it's really not that bad

1335.039 --> 1339.679
but you guys are

1337.919 --> 1342.24
the worst

1339.679 --> 1345.76
the most lame

1342.24 --> 1347.919
the most wasted time the most uncreative

1345.76 --> 1349.76
the most unhappy

1347.919 --> 1351.2
you're not even happy about what you're

1349.76 --> 1355.36
doing

1351.2 --> 1355.3600000000001
it's just like oh my god

1355.76 --> 1359.36
it's it's a giant tragedy

1358.64 --> 1362.5590000000002
like

1359.36 --> 1365.76
you are literally the

1362.559 --> 1368.3999999999999
butthole droppings of society you're the

1365.76 --> 1371.2
shitty leftovers

1368.4 --> 1374.159
you realize that you're you're the poop

1371.2 --> 1375.2
in the bucket

1374.159 --> 1377.5200000000002
that's you

1375.2 --> 1377.52
troll

1381.6 --> 1385.28
online begging is better

1384.0 --> 1387.52
absolutely

1385.28 --> 1388.96
it works

1387.52 --> 1390.799
and i feel

1388.96 --> 1392.559
not ashamed for it if i actually feel

1390.799 --> 1394.48
kind of good for it because it means

1392.559 --> 1397.36
that people

1394.48 --> 1399.919
despite all this [ __ ]

1397.36 --> 1401.9189999999999
and even despite my kind of shortcomings

1399.919 --> 1403.039
because i'm not perfect i'm not like a

1401.919 --> 1406.4
perfectly

1403.039 --> 1410.48
media trained entertainer

1406.4 --> 1414.0800000000002
i'm raw actually raw not just

1410.48 --> 1417.52
i'm raw actually raw real as in what a

1414.08 --> 1418.8799999999999
real person is like

1417.52 --> 1422.799
and

1418.88 --> 1422.7990000000002
i'm still getting support

1423.36 --> 1430.7199999999998
for my yeah my online projects

1427.52 --> 1432.96
for simply my presence and people

1430.72 --> 1435.1200000000001
wanting my presence yeah i get

1432.96 --> 1436.88
maintenance for that i get financial

1435.12 --> 1438.8799999999999
support

1436.88 --> 1440.7990000000002
that sometimes i have to beg for because

1438.88 --> 1443.279
people kind of forget

1440.799 --> 1444.6399999999999
and then i run out of money yeah i have

1443.279 --> 1448.32
to do that

1444.64 --> 1450.5590000000002
feels excellent you know this actually

1448.32 --> 1453.4399999999998
feels better

1450.559 --> 1456.559
than having a job somewhere

1453.44 --> 1460.64
not properly being able to do your job

1456.559 --> 1463.76
because of how everything is arranged

1460.64 --> 1464.7990000000002
and then constantly being cut off

1463.76 --> 1467.2
and

1464.799 --> 1468.8799999999999
if you dare act like you're actually

1467.2 --> 1470.559
smart and you want to do something good

1468.88 --> 1475.279
against your boss you you might get

1470.559 --> 1479.039
fired yeah i'll take begging for money

1475.279 --> 1481.84
from people all over the world

1479.039 --> 1485.279
to be an online presence

1481.84 --> 1489.4399999999998
any day of the week over that setup

1485.279 --> 1491.279
thanks i'll do this i will do this and

1489.44 --> 1493.3600000000001
back for money

1491.279 --> 1495.44
on a daily basis

1493.36 --> 1499.6
because it's a thousand times better

1495.44 --> 1503.039
than being locked up in some shitty job

1499.6 --> 1506.1589999999999
where everybody's just deranged mentally

1503.039 --> 1509.12
and socially and indoctrinated with news

1506.159 --> 1511.6000000000001
and stupid pop music garbage all the

1509.12 --> 1513.279
time you have forced to listen to that

1511.6 --> 1515.6789999999999
[ __ ]

1513.279 --> 1517.6
and then if you actually have some kind

1515.679 --> 1519.2
of a vision for your job to make

1517.6 --> 1522.0
everything better

1519.2 --> 1525.919
you're being scoffed at or even fired

1522.0 --> 1528.64
yeah i'll take this [ __ ] life over

1525.919 --> 1532.1200000000001
that any day of the week [ __ ]

1528.64 --> 1532.1200000000001
yeah i will

1542.559 --> 1546.279
got anything else

1561.6 --> 1564.6
ugh

1579.039 --> 1585.1589999999999
yeah yeah thanks adam price i appreciate

1581.919 --> 1585.159
your appreciation

1588.08 --> 1594.0
you know but i'm also here to basically

1590.799 --> 1595.679
disarm the last third tentacles from

1594.0 --> 1597.679
these trolls because

1595.679 --> 1600.0800000000002
this is the [ __ ] they've been saying the

1597.679 --> 1603.6000000000001
same kind of crappy [ __ ]

1600.08 --> 1606.0
for a pretty persistent amount of three

1603.6 --> 1609.4399999999998
or four years now

1606.0 --> 1610.559
so i'm just addressing it i'm taking

1609.44 --> 1613.52
every

1610.559 --> 1616.6399999999999
[ __ ] little thing you think in your

1613.52 --> 1618.559
pathetic little troll [ __ ] heart

1616.64 --> 1621.039
and you think you have against me and

1618.559 --> 1623.84
which you think makes you better than me

1621.039 --> 1627.44
in some form or another and i'm just

1623.84 --> 1629.6789999999999
undoing that i'm taking your little [ __ ]

1627.44 --> 1632.72
toy away from you

1629.679 --> 1634.48
the last few little things you had

1632.72 --> 1636.159
[ __ ]

1634.48 --> 1638.159
maybe you should just get a life you

1636.159 --> 1640.64
piece of [ __ ]

1638.159 --> 1643.2
yeah instead of trying

1640.64 --> 1645.679
just trying

1643.2 --> 1648.3600000000001
to knack somebody you think you're

1645.679 --> 1651.039
better because of some really stupid

1648.36 --> 1654.1589999999999
ill-thought-out reason

1651.039 --> 1657.2
which i am dispelling for you because i

1654.159 --> 1660.5590000000002
can because what i say is true

1657.2 --> 1664.2
and actually thought through huh

1660.559 --> 1664.2
what you gonna do

1672.48 --> 1675.48
ah

1683.679 --> 1688.24
besides

1685.039 --> 1688.24
i love doing this

1688.96 --> 1695.6000000000001
you think i could ever do this to anyone

1693.12 --> 1697.76
at some kind of a workplace

1695.6 --> 1700.8799999999999
that i could express myself to this

1697.76 --> 1703.76
level anywhere except online

1700.88 --> 1703.7600000000002
i don't think so

1704.32 --> 1708.84
right at the workplace if somebody is an

1707.12 --> 1714.1589999999999
actual troll

1708.84 --> 1717.6
scumbag like a life destroying scumbag

1714.159 --> 1719.44
you usually just have to take the scars

1717.6 --> 1721.84
and you have to listen how in the

1719.44 --> 1725.44
distance they destroy other people's

1721.84 --> 1727.12
lives because if you get in their face

1725.44 --> 1730.48
they'll come after you and then they'll

1727.12 --> 1733.12
destroy your life slander you

1730.48 --> 1735.279
talk bad talk [ __ ] about you behind your

1733.12 --> 1737.9189999999999
back against the boss

1735.279 --> 1741.2
yeah that sort of garbage well guess

1737.919 --> 1743.279
what i don't have to deal with that

1741.2 --> 1746.72
because

1743.279 --> 1750.799
on this platform doing what i do i am my

1746.72 --> 1754.96
own boss nobody [ __ ] tells me what to

1750.799 --> 1757.039
do how to do it how to talk to get media

1754.96 --> 1758.559
training

1757.039 --> 1760.399
to adapt

1758.559 --> 1762.12
to this [ __ ]

1760.399 --> 1764.799
degenerating

1762.12 --> 1765.9189999999999
anti-social demonic world

1764.799 --> 1767.9189999999999
yeah

1765.919 --> 1771.039
nobody's gonna tell me that here i'm

1767.919 --> 1772.7990000000002
gonna do it exactly the way i [ __ ]

1771.039 --> 1774.399
want to

1772.799 --> 1776.96
get me [ __ ]

1774.399 --> 1776.9599999999998
my way

1778.64 --> 1782.88
and

1779.76 --> 1786.08
i get the bag for money and then get it

1782.88 --> 1788.96
because people actually appreciate it

1786.08 --> 1788.96
yeah how is that

1789.52 --> 1795.2
how's that

1791.6 --> 1797.1999999999998
compared to some shitty standard job

1795.2 --> 1800.3990000000001
that doesn't even effectively do

1797.2 --> 1802.3990000000001
anything to better the world in any way

1800.399 --> 1805.1999999999998
makes people miserable

1802.399 --> 1809.0
creates a lot of garbage

1805.2 --> 1809.0
it's just more waste

1809.279 --> 1814.0
yeah

1811.44 --> 1816.24
nobody cares you're doing that

1814.0 --> 1819.52
[ __ ] you're just trying to make a book

1816.24 --> 1822.24
yeah and basically ruining your time

1819.52 --> 1824.72
ruining the environment ruining

1822.24 --> 1827.44
everybody's life with your nagging that

1824.72 --> 1830.3990000000001
you're obligated to do because of

1827.44 --> 1831.279
advertisement for your shitty company

1830.399 --> 1832.9599999999998
yeah

1831.279 --> 1837.08
i'll take this

1832.96 --> 1837.08
i'll do this thanks

1839.679 --> 1846.0

1878.799 --> 1881.2
doing

1881.84 --> 1884.8799999999999
basically prove

1886.0 --> 1890.159
why this is a job why this is good

1888.72 --> 1892.88
why this works

1890.159 --> 1896.159
why there is development

1892.88 --> 1898.5590000000002
why i am doing what i do

1896.159 --> 1900.64
just for the psychology of it alone and

1898.559 --> 1902.72
fractal thinking and all of my pretty

1900.64 --> 1905.76
fringe ideas

1902.72 --> 1907.76
how this is actually contributing

1905.76 --> 1911.039
you think i could be contributing to

1907.76 --> 1913.36
those levels doing some standard shitty

1911.039 --> 1913.36
job

1913.6 --> 1917.6789999999999
where i'd have to stress all the time

1916.24 --> 1920.799
like oh my god

1917.679 --> 1923.039
how can i make them stop taking some

1920.799 --> 1926.96
stupid

1923.039 --> 1928.96
v test or a c test you know

1926.96 --> 1930.32
that garbage

1928.96 --> 1932.72
like

1930.32 --> 1935.2
i did i don't even want to worry about

1932.72 --> 1938.0
that i don't even wanna think it's

1935.2 --> 1942.24
possible to try and look for a jump and

1938.0 --> 1944.48
then job and then bump into that garbage

1942.24 --> 1946.159
you know i'm not even gonna try to find

1944.48 --> 1949.279
a job until

1946.159 --> 1950.96
like all that shit's been forbidden

1949.279 --> 1955.519
forbidden

1950.96 --> 1955.519
no more c tests forbidden

1957.12 --> 1960.4799999999998
yeah

1958.32 --> 1961.6789999999999
like

1960.48 --> 1963.76
till the point

1961.679 --> 1966.5590000000002
that's literally forbidden to get

1963.76 --> 1966.559
involved with that

1969.6 --> 1974.84
like you are not allowed as a

1973.519 --> 1978.32
just

1974.84 --> 1979.6789999999999
employee employer employee

1978.32 --> 1981.84
the one that

1979.679 --> 1984.48
provides the jobs that you're literally

1981.84 --> 1986.6399999999999
not allowed to ask for

1984.48 --> 1988.72
corona status

1986.64 --> 1991.519
anything

1988.72 --> 1996.919
force a test nothing nothing must be

1991.519 --> 1996.919
completely illegal illegal

1997.039 --> 2002.1589999999999
punished with great fines and

1999.039 --> 2006.399
potentially jail time with repeated

2002.159 --> 2008.0800000000002
offense how about that huh

2006.399 --> 2010.399
and when that time comes then i'll

2008.08 --> 2013.72
consider getting a regular job on the

2010.399 --> 2013.7199999999998
side maybe

2014.04 --> 2017.24
[Music]

2018.32 --> 2023.4399999999998
self-employed roofing oh that's great

2021.2 --> 2025.519
just will soaring

2023.44 --> 2029.8400000000001
yeah there's this there's no time like

2025.519 --> 2029.84
now when it comes to self-employment

2031.279 --> 2036.64
right nobody's you are not gonna make

2033.84 --> 2038.9599999999998
you get that stupid test because you're

2036.64 --> 2042.159
not a dumbass

2038.96 --> 2044.96
media indoctrinated [ __ ] that believes

2042.159 --> 2048.2400000000002
in blatantly fraudulent psychological

2044.96 --> 2050.639
warfare operations under the guise of

2048.24 --> 2052.879
medical emergency yeah because you're

2050.639 --> 2054.7200000000003
not a [ __ ] you're not going to be

2052.879 --> 2057.2
forced to subject yourself to that

2054.72 --> 2058.879
garbage yeah isn't that great

2057.2 --> 2061.839
it's awesome

2058.879 --> 2063.5989999999997
well done jazz will soaring

2061.839 --> 2065.7599999999998
and most of you guys i think most of you

2063.599 --> 2068.8
guys are self-employed

2065.76 --> 2068.8
a lot of you anyway

2071.679 --> 2075.48
that's the way to go

2077.04 --> 2080.639
you know

2078.0 --> 2082.639
getting an easy job

2080.639 --> 2085.76
in a big company

2082.639 --> 2087.44
yeah it seemed very convenient you know

2085.76 --> 2089.44
when everything is all right out there

2087.44 --> 2092.159
and you just want to move on just want

2089.44 --> 2094.56
to get in a career quick money yeah

2092.159 --> 2096.96
that's really great when the world's

2094.56 --> 2099.2
turned to retardation

2096.96 --> 2102.48
and [ __ ]

2099.2 --> 2104.0789999999997
that's the last place you want to be

2102.48 --> 2106.32
because you're going to be subjected to

2104.079 --> 2108.7200000000003
all of that well first it was all easy

2106.32 --> 2110.1600000000003
smooth convenient quick you know you

2108.72 --> 2112.24
don't have to worry about everything and

2110.16 --> 2115.2799999999997
just leave that to the company yeah

2112.24 --> 2118.9599999999996
guess what that's completely 180 degrees

2115.28 --> 2120.4
now that's the exact opposite

2118.96 --> 2122.4
it's the last place you want to be

2120.4 --> 2124.079
forced at right you want to be

2122.4 --> 2126.32
self-employed

2124.079 --> 2128.0
so you make the rules you can figure out

2126.32 --> 2132.079
what's real

2128.0 --> 2136.56
and then you'll be able to choose

2132.079 --> 2137.92
how to avoid the insanity out there

2136.56 --> 2140.16
because you're self-employed you will

2137.92 --> 2142.48
make the choice because you're the boss

2140.16 --> 2143.7599999999998
nobody's going to tell you no delusional

2142.48 --> 2146.64
idiot

2143.76 --> 2150.6400000000003
is gonna ruin your life

2146.64 --> 2153.68
because they refuse to see basic logic

2150.64 --> 2155.52
because they refuse to see how they were

2153.68 --> 2158.48
fooled

2155.52 --> 2160.24
by stupid media psychological warfare

2158.48 --> 2162.32
indoctrination

2160.24 --> 2166.9199999999996
yeah it's nothing like being

2162.32 --> 2166.92
self-employed in a time like this

2176.44 --> 2181.28
[Music]

2178.96 --> 2181.28
ah

2182.64 --> 2188.96
brainwashed line worker

2184.72 --> 2192.0
years ago one job best friend well yeah

2188.96 --> 2193.92
well factory jobs you know assembly line

2192.0 --> 2196.8
job

2193.92 --> 2199.04
some can be really good actually

2196.8 --> 2201.92
but yeah you

2199.04 --> 2204.48
you will be subjected to

2201.92 --> 2205.599
indoctrination [ __ ]

2204.48 --> 2208.64
but

2205.599 --> 2210.96
usually i don't know though

2208.64 --> 2213.5989999999997
i don't know how bad it gets if they can

2210.96 --> 2215.76
really force you like you

2213.599 --> 2218.079
you're not falling in line with the

2215.76 --> 2220.079
party thinking

2218.079 --> 2222.6400000000003
so we're going to

2220.079 --> 2224.8
denounce your membership of the union or

2222.64 --> 2226.96
something and then you get into trouble

2224.8 --> 2229.8390000000004
i don't know how that works i don't know

2226.96 --> 2229.839
how bad they get

2231.92 --> 2235.28
but overall like

2233.76 --> 2237.599
factory

2235.28 --> 2240.2400000000002
jobs especially assembly for machine

2237.599 --> 2242.56
arena that those can be really good jobs

2240.24 --> 2244.0
pretty well paying too so

2242.56 --> 2245.92
yeah

2244.0 --> 2248.96
but still in this age you know with all

2245.92 --> 2251.19
this craziness going on out there

2248.96 --> 2254.34
it's not going to be easier

2251.19 --> 2254.34
[Music]

2261.28 --> 2264.6400000000003
you don't think they will attack the

2262.72 --> 2266.3999999999996
self-employed in some way down the road

2264.64 --> 2267.7599999999998
yes of course but they're already doing

2266.4 --> 2270.4
that

2267.76 --> 2272.2400000000002
through taxation making it very tough on

2270.4 --> 2274.88
you

2272.24 --> 2277.5989999999997
right being self-employed makes taxes a

2274.88 --> 2277.599
little tougher

2278.16 --> 2282.0789999999997
unless you're like really super business

2280.4 --> 2285.079
savvy and always like

2282.079 --> 2285.079
fluid

2286.16 --> 2289.52
but

2287.2 --> 2291.7599999999998
no they can't really come after you look

2289.52 --> 2294.4
what they can do

2291.76 --> 2296.88
it's look it's really this simple you

2294.4 --> 2301.52
got to realize the entire c

2296.88 --> 2303.359
situation in medical industrial tyranny

2301.52 --> 2307.28
is pure

2303.359 --> 2309.839
pure absolute pure psychological warfare

2307.28 --> 2313.2000000000003
which means there's no actual risk not

2309.839 --> 2314.72
even legally there's legally no risk

2313.2 --> 2317.52
it's pure

2314.72 --> 2320.3199999999997
psychological threat based

2317.52 --> 2324.32
right there's no actual medical danger

2320.32 --> 2327.28
whatsoever zero officially judicially

2324.32 --> 2330.0
zero risk so

2327.28 --> 2331.92
as a self-employed person

2330.0 --> 2334.8
it's all about

2331.92 --> 2337.28
your client right where are they at are

2334.8 --> 2340.1600000000003
they gonna be like oh put on a mask i'm

2337.28 --> 2341.28
scared yeah because if you then violate

2340.16 --> 2343.2
that

2341.28 --> 2345.2000000000003
they could literally step to those

2343.2 --> 2348.0789999999997
organizations and then make them come

2345.2 --> 2350.3199999999997
after you that can still happen

2348.079 --> 2351.8390000000004
but as long as you have an understanding

2350.32 --> 2354.7200000000003
with your clients

2351.839 --> 2358.0789999999997
and they know it's [ __ ] nobody in

2354.72 --> 2358.9599999999996
the world can make you wear a mask take

2358.079 --> 2361.2000000000003
a v

2358.96 --> 2363.599
nobody in the world can do that

2361.2 --> 2366.0789999999997
it's only if your clientele is going to

2363.599 --> 2368.079
be threatened by all that nonsense

2366.079 --> 2371.28
you might want to consider either

2368.079 --> 2372.32
rejecting the job and moving on

2371.28 --> 2373.92
or

2372.32 --> 2376.6400000000003
kind of going with it because you kind

2373.92 --> 2378.96
of really need it in the moment and then

2376.64 --> 2380.8799999999997
yeah just don't take the v no matter

2378.96 --> 2382.64
what right

2380.88 --> 2384.96
so that's up to you

2382.64 --> 2387.1189999999997
but legally there is no threat there

2384.96 --> 2389.2
they can't come after self-employed

2387.119 --> 2391.52
people they cannot

2389.2 --> 2393.2799999999997
they can

2391.52 --> 2395.839
theoretically i don't really see it

2393.28 --> 2398.96
happening make everybody out there so

2395.839 --> 2401.7599999999998
insane they'll be too scared to hire you

2398.96 --> 2404.48
if you don't comply

2401.76 --> 2407.2000000000003
with the crazy measures right that's the

2404.48 --> 2410.4
worst they could theoretically do

2407.2 --> 2411.5989999999997
but my god that would literally be

2410.4 --> 2413.76
like

2411.599 --> 2414.8
the break

2413.76 --> 2416.8
like

2414.8 --> 2418.079
a society like that's not gonna last

2416.8 --> 2421.6800000000003
very long

2418.079 --> 2422.96
it's gonna be very dead very quickly if

2421.68 --> 2423.68
it's that bad

2422.96 --> 2426.4
so

2423.68 --> 2428.64
yeah i wouldn't worry too much

2426.4 --> 2428.64
right

2432.64 --> 2438.4
self-driving taxis and bus no

2435.44 --> 2441.359
no

2438.4 --> 2441.359
that could never work

2442.72 --> 2447.839
this is a non-stop chain of disasters

2445.28 --> 2449.3590000000004
waiting to happen

2447.839 --> 2451.68
serious

2449.359 --> 2455.119
like they can't work

2451.68 --> 2457.2799999999997
that only works in the movies it only

2455.119 --> 2460.0
works in the movies it's gonna be a

2457.28 --> 2463.52
disaster

2460.0 --> 2467.839
it's gonna leave a standard death rate

2463.52 --> 2469.7599999999998
trail okay standard death rate trail

2467.839 --> 2473.52
over time

2469.76 --> 2475.8390000000004
right it's going to be more accidents

2473.52 --> 2478.4
than drunk driving

2475.839 --> 2480.56
from just technical malfunction okay

2478.4 --> 2484.319
there's no way that's gonna work it's

2480.56 --> 2487.04
just no way there is no way never ever

2484.319 --> 2490.319
it's never gonna work it's never gonna

2487.04 --> 2492.0
become working at some stage it's never

2490.319 --> 2494.079
gonna work

2492.0 --> 2496.319
ever

2494.079 --> 2498.079
it's ridiculous it's ridiculous to think

2496.319 --> 2501.599
that could ever work

2498.079 --> 2504.6400000000003
fully automated robotic cars it's never

2501.599 --> 2504.6400000000003
going to work never

2504.96 --> 2510.079
it's always going to break down and

2506.96 --> 2511.44
who's going to repair all that [ __ ]

2510.079 --> 2514.7200000000003
what you think just

2511.44 --> 2516.7200000000003
quickly producing a completely new car

2514.72 --> 2518.56
is not going to yield the exact same

2516.72 --> 2519.839
problems it's

2518.56 --> 2522.48
problems

2519.839 --> 2525.599
can stack up going gonna get worse and

2522.48 --> 2528.56
worse and worse until literally the

2525.599 --> 2531.599
engineers give up

2528.56 --> 2533.2799999999997
that's my official prediction automated

2531.599 --> 2535.92
car systems

2533.28 --> 2539.76
it's gonna get so bad so problematic the

2535.92 --> 2542.56
engineers will give up

2539.76 --> 2544.48
swear it i swear it will happen

2542.56 --> 2546.319
they will give up they will be like

2544.48 --> 2547.92
we're done with this

2546.319 --> 2550.079
we can't get it

2547.92 --> 2551.839
underneath this rate of accidents who

2550.079 --> 2553.8390000000004
can't do it

2551.839 --> 2556.4
and then they'll just give up

2553.839 --> 2561.88
it's never going to happen

2556.4 --> 2561.88
only works in the movies only

2568.48 --> 2573.119
how do i know i don't know how i know i

2571.28 --> 2575.28
know

2573.119 --> 2578.079
i'm gonna say dark world vision you know

2575.28 --> 2579.52
i got 80 years

2578.079 --> 2581.76
i got to see

2579.52 --> 2583.7599999999998
holographic projector screens being

2581.76 --> 2586.96
standardized

2583.76 --> 2589.2000000000003
self-driving cars no

2586.96 --> 2590.8
never

2589.2 --> 2593.52
it's never going to happen

2590.8 --> 2596.48
nobody wants it nobody needs it it never

2593.52 --> 2599.92
works it's a disaster

2596.48 --> 2602.48
the more fully automated robotic things

2599.92 --> 2603.6800000000003
the more breakdown right and in the

2602.48 --> 2606.319
meantime

2603.68 --> 2608.0
all the technology is being

2606.319 --> 2610.96
re-engineered

2608.0 --> 2613.119
to be quick throwaway garbage

2610.96 --> 2615.28
yeah well guess what quick throwaway

2613.119 --> 2617.44
garbage is not going to be tinkered it's

2615.28 --> 2619.119
not going to be perfected

2617.44 --> 2620.48
it's not going to be tested eventually

2619.119 --> 2622.319
eventually

2620.48 --> 2625.2
the amount of flaws

2622.319 --> 2628.079
will start to stack up so badly in all

2625.2 --> 2628.0789999999997
electronics

2628.64 --> 2631.839
it's just

2629.68 --> 2634.16
people are going to be sick it might

2631.839 --> 2636.7999999999997
actually get so bad people will

2634.16 --> 2638.64
literally just start to stop buying

2636.8 --> 2641.44
technological [ __ ]

2638.64 --> 2643.68
gonna be like nope

2641.44 --> 2645.599
we're just gonna go with no electronics

2643.68 --> 2648.0
we're sick of it we're sick of buying

2645.599 --> 2649.839
anything and then like in a few days it

2648.0 --> 2652.56
breaks and then we have to

2649.839 --> 2654.4
fill in the stupid form and send it and

2652.56 --> 2657.2
then we're going to get complaints and

2654.4 --> 2659.119
no social credit check and then we don't

2657.2 --> 2662.319
get it fixed and then we wasted all our

2659.119 --> 2664.8
money yeah yeah guess what people are

2662.319 --> 2666.8
gonna get sick of technology and its

2664.8 --> 2669.76
standardization

2666.8 --> 2673.6800000000003
and garbage the scam that builds up on

2669.76 --> 2676.0
top of it of insurance and fixing it and

2673.68 --> 2678.3999999999996
we need more data from you we need to

2676.0 --> 2680.96
register you register this and that and

2678.4 --> 2683.359
no pay for this fee and yeah it's going

2680.96 --> 2685.52
to get worse and worse and worse and

2683.359 --> 2689.119
then people are going to say

2685.52 --> 2689.119
[ __ ] your technology

2689.359 --> 2694.72
we're done with this garbage

2692.64 --> 2698.64
we're just gonna make our own stuff that

2694.72 --> 2699.839
doesn't have technological garbage in it

2698.64 --> 2701.68
stupid

2699.839 --> 2704.96
failed computers

2701.68 --> 2708.319
constantly break down always nag always

2704.96 --> 2710.8
do unwanted corporate scam things when

2708.319 --> 2712.64
you never want that you just want them

2710.8 --> 2714.96
to do what you want them to do what they

2712.64 --> 2716.319
were supposedly designed for not to be

2714.96 --> 2718.96
ad bots

2716.319 --> 2721.2799999999997
for freaking mega corporations all the

2718.96 --> 2725.28
time yeah

2721.28 --> 2727.76
they're gonna throw your garbage away

2725.28 --> 2730.88
and then you're gonna go bust

2727.76 --> 2732.6400000000003
and you'll lose your billions

2730.88 --> 2733.92
and then you'll get into really big

2732.64 --> 2736.0
trouble

2733.92 --> 2737.44
really big trouble

2736.0 --> 2740.68
probably freaking

2737.44 --> 2743.78
in mega industrials just kill

2740.68 --> 2743.7799999999997
[Music]

2747.119 --> 2751.359
because they don't really have a vision

2749.28 --> 2753.3590000000004
they're just corporatist

2751.359 --> 2755.2799999999997
so they're just gonna build on that

2753.359 --> 2757.04
ladder downward

2755.28 --> 2758.4
oh we know exactly what's gonna happen

2757.04 --> 2761.2799999999997
with this and this and the average

2758.4 --> 2762.88
prediction profile of people well this

2761.28 --> 2766.0
is the best way

2762.88 --> 2768.4
towards hell absolutely inevitably yeah

2766.0 --> 2771.119
that's part of that isn't it right

2768.4 --> 2773.44
corporatism is only temporary it works

2771.119 --> 2776.56
temporary in a temporary setting you

2773.44 --> 2778.319
can't make that permanent it's gonna die

2776.56 --> 2781.04
it's corporation

2778.319 --> 2784.0
it's dead it's going to rot and then

2781.04 --> 2786.24
decompose and it doesn't work anymore

2784.0 --> 2789.24
that's what it does that's the spirit of

2786.24 --> 2789.24
corporatism

2795.83 --> 2801.2
[Music]

2798.88 --> 2804.0
yeah

2801.2 --> 2808.8799999999997
that's ridiculous jazz will soaring like

2804.0 --> 2808.88
no people are gonna make their own [ __ ]

2809.119 --> 2814.6400000000003
it's not even that hard anymore

2811.92 --> 2816.359
right we don't need

2814.64 --> 2817.92
standardized

2816.359 --> 2821.68
industrial

2817.92 --> 2823.839
garbage anymore we don't need it

2821.68 --> 2826.72
we can make things

2823.839 --> 2827.7599999999998
we can make it ourselves we can keep it

2826.72 --> 2830.3999999999996
simple

2827.76 --> 2832.76
because we don't have to tinker tailor

2830.4 --> 2835.28
it to the latest mind control

2832.76 --> 2838.5600000000004
advertisement for the mega corporation

2835.28 --> 2841.3590000000004
to keep growing so bezos can buy another

2838.56 --> 2845.359
bigger yacht yeah we don't need that you

2841.359 --> 2848.48
can literally craft a bike

2845.359 --> 2852.48
you can literally make it

2848.48 --> 2854.319
you can make it yourself simple learn

2852.48 --> 2856.48
from all the history of its develop you

2854.319 --> 2859.68
can just make it yourself who the [ __ ]

2856.48 --> 2862.72
needs a stupid e-bike or anything you

2859.68 --> 2864.8799999999997
can make it yourself

2862.72 --> 2868.0
you could all make it yourself you don't

2864.88 --> 2873.2400000000002
need industrialized standardized

2868.0 --> 2873.24
corporate garbage you don't need it

2873.92 --> 2878.079
they need you you don't need them

2885.44 --> 2888.559
on fire today

2891.52 --> 2895.04
i think that the

2892.88 --> 2896.6400000000003
the pit of trolls

2895.04 --> 2898.079
kind of kindled it

2896.64 --> 2900.8799999999997
trolls fell in

2898.079 --> 2902.559
lit it on fire plenty of feces there to

2900.88 --> 2906.0
keep it burning

2902.559 --> 2906.0
and now i'm all fired up

2909.2 --> 2912.839
but you know i think that

2911.599 --> 2916.1600000000003
trolling

2912.839 --> 2918.64
trolls and corporatist

2916.16 --> 2919.92
psychopath

2918.64 --> 2922.4
amoral

2919.92 --> 2924.559
overlords are literally of the same

2922.4 --> 2925.6800000000003
frequency it's just one doesn't have any

2924.559 --> 2927.599
power

2925.68 --> 2930.5589999999997
and the other does i think they're all

2927.599 --> 2931.839
the same frequency that's why one

2930.559 --> 2932.559
subject

2931.839 --> 2934.96
like

2932.559 --> 2936.3190000000004
flew

2934.96 --> 2938.96
flowed

2936.319 --> 2942.7599999999998
into the other

2938.96 --> 2942.76
it's all the same garbage

2947.52 --> 2951.92
spiritual ignorance

2949.76 --> 2954.8
and earthly greed

2951.92 --> 2956.559
is what fuels both

2954.8 --> 2960.2000000000003
spiritual ignorance

2956.559 --> 2960.2000000000003
earthly greed

2974.48 --> 2976.96
anyway

2977.119 --> 2980.92
i'm done with the rant

2989.599 --> 2995.6800000000003
yeah a mega industrialist hey aaa mega

2993.599 --> 2997.3590000000004
industrialist hey you think you're so

2995.68 --> 3001.68
smart right

2997.359 --> 3004.64
why just stop this futurist retardation

3001.68 --> 3006.0
and just focus on things

3004.64 --> 3009.68
that work

3006.0 --> 3012.079
and that don't break down how about that

3009.68 --> 3014.24
you know it's been over a hundred years

3012.079 --> 3016.4
with your freaking industry

3014.24 --> 3019.52
why don't you make things that actually

3016.4 --> 3021.359
last the test of time for a damn change

3019.52 --> 3023.839
why don't you actually just start making

3021.359 --> 3026.319
products that don't break down as

3023.839 --> 3029.119
quickly as possible so people will be

3026.319 --> 3030.319
forced to buy more of your garbage how

3029.119 --> 3032.6400000000003
about that

3030.319 --> 3036.96
huh

3032.64 --> 3036.96
but actually making something that works

3038.24 --> 3042.9599999999996
instead of your stupid little futurist

3041.2 --> 3045.2799999999997
sci-fi

3042.96 --> 3048.64
movie drunk ideas

3045.28 --> 3051.0400000000004
that don't work and nobody needs it

3048.64 --> 3053.5989999999997
nobody actually needs it people only

3051.04 --> 3054.72
want that to brag

3053.599 --> 3057.839
to

3054.72 --> 3060.7999999999997
seem like they're all better they're not

3057.839 --> 3063.44
nobody wants that nobody wants those

3060.8 --> 3065.119
people to have that garbage yeah it's

3063.44 --> 3067.28
gonna break down on them anyway and then

3065.119 --> 3069.839
they'll just forget about it and stop

3067.28 --> 3072.4
carrying yeah easy quick cash for you

3069.839 --> 3073.92
yes scumbag

3072.4 --> 3076.4
scumbag

3073.92 --> 3079.599
start making products that actually work

3076.4 --> 3082.1600000000003
and don't break down all the time

3079.599 --> 3084.079
once you make things that last the test

3082.16 --> 3086.2
of time why don't you make a

3084.079 --> 3089.3590000000004
standardized

3086.2 --> 3090.5589999999997
notification on products on industrial

3089.359 --> 3094.319
products

3090.559 --> 3095.28
lasts this amount of years

3094.319 --> 3098.4
yeah

3095.28 --> 3098.4
why don't you make that

3098.96 --> 3103.359
a guarantee lasts

3101.52 --> 3107.04
20 years

3103.359 --> 3111.839
10 years right how about that when is

3107.04 --> 3111.839
the industrial standard for that coming

3113.359 --> 3116.319
where is it

3114.559 --> 3119.44
why don't you do something useful with

3116.319 --> 3121.119
your stupid government standardization

3119.44 --> 3123.599
why don't you do something useful

3121.119 --> 3126.1600000000003
instead of just turning everybody into

3123.599 --> 3128.48
slaves and trying to enrich you and your

3126.16 --> 3132.44
stinking greedy buddies

3128.48 --> 3132.44
why don't you do something useful

3146.91 --> 3153.72
[Music]

3150.72 --> 3153.72
ah

3156.48 --> 3162.119
i wasn't completely

3158.16 --> 3162.1189999999997
done with my rant anyway

3168.24 --> 3171.1189999999997
well

3169.04 --> 3173.599
phil cantu

3171.119 --> 3175.839
is fluttered poker really dead well has

3173.599 --> 3180.079
anybody actually seen him

3175.839 --> 3182.72
since he allegedly i guess died

3180.079 --> 3184.2400000000002
i mean if he'd pop up somewhere you know

3182.72 --> 3186.16
what's gonna happen click click click

3184.24 --> 3188.9599999999996
click right

3186.16 --> 3192.16
so no i think he is dead

3188.96 --> 3194.96
otherwise he would have popped up

3192.16 --> 3197.2
he's not gonna be secretly evacuated to

3194.96 --> 3199.52
some other place

3197.2 --> 3201.359
flirts are useful oh yeah

3199.52 --> 3205.28
absolutely we are

3201.359 --> 3207.2799999999997
straightforward direct inquisitive

3205.28 --> 3209.44
meticulous

3207.28 --> 3212.2400000000002
creative

3209.44 --> 3214.96

this world buddy or the best thing that

3218.88 --> 3223.839
ever happened to this world

3221.44 --> 3223.839
the truth

3224.559 --> 3230.48
nothing is more valuable on the long run

3227.359 --> 3230.48
than the truth

3230.559 --> 3234.88
and those that seek it no matter the

3232.8 --> 3236.4
cost

3234.88 --> 3240.6400000000003
are

even though everybody might be blinded

3245.119 --> 3249.76
and agitated and might even attack it

3247.92 --> 3252.319
right no you got all suddenly all these

3249.76 --> 3254.4
secrets come to flood all these shitty

3252.319 --> 3256.5589999999997
things you've done in your life that you

3254.4 --> 3259.839
don't want anybody to know about

3256.559 --> 3262.3190000000004
yeah yeah those people truthers

3259.839 --> 3264.72
flat earthers yeah they

3262.319 --> 3267.119
make you look bad

3264.72 --> 3270.5589999999997
not because they make you bad it's

3267.119 --> 3272.319
because you were bad and it's coming to

3270.559 --> 3273.6800000000003
light thanks to us

3272.319 --> 3276.5589999999997

3276.559 --> 3283.2000000000003
on it we're not making you bad you were

3279.52 --> 3285.52
bad and we're exposing you by shining

3283.2 --> 3289.0789999999997
the light of truth

3285.52 --> 3289.079
that's what we do

3313.04 --> 3314.5589999999997
oh

3313.34 --> 3318.48
[Music]

3314.559 --> 3321.6800000000003
look at all the retracted messages

3318.48 --> 3324.319
it's so tough being a troll trying to

3321.68 --> 3326.24
say something that actually works

3324.319 --> 3330.599
from your perspective

3326.24 --> 3330.5989999999997
so tough isn't it mystery mongoose

3343.2 --> 3346.2
ah

3362.16 --> 3366.64
yeah that's right you as well sorry yes

3364.24 --> 3366.64
we do

3366.72 --> 3369.04
right

3370.319 --> 3375.599
and it's it was always gonna be that way

3373.119 --> 3376.6400000000003
you know because the ballers

3375.599 --> 3378.799
rest

3376.64 --> 3381.7599999999998
traditionally even before flat earth on

3378.799 --> 3385.359
the preponderance of knowledge all this

3381.76 --> 3387.119
data supposed data all this math

3385.359 --> 3389.2799999999997
that was made

3387.119 --> 3391.839
to prove it's a ball

3389.28 --> 3394.6400000000003
but ballers themselves never

3391.839 --> 3396.16
get into every single detail of

3394.64 --> 3398.8799999999997
something

3396.16 --> 3400.48
they like to memorize things typically

3398.88 --> 3402.319
that's what made them so good at school

3400.48 --> 3405.52
and all that memorization even tough

3402.319 --> 3407.04
things memorize them very quickly right

3405.52 --> 3410.16
memorization

3407.04 --> 3412.319
doesn't automatically deliver you

3410.16 --> 3415.2799999999997
insight

3412.319 --> 3417.2
and creative thinking to actually figure

3415.28 --> 3419.28
out what it is you're looking at like is

3417.2 --> 3421.5989999999997
this correct you're learning something

3419.28 --> 3423.52
by heart is it actually correct do you

3421.599 --> 3426.319
actually understand

3423.52 --> 3428.96
what it is why it's there how it came

3426.319 --> 3428.96
into being

3429.04 --> 3434.5589999999997
what are the mistakes people make with

3431.44 --> 3437.2000000000003
it typically all this is all knowledge

3434.559 --> 3439.3590000000004
a lot of blur first they don't really

3437.2 --> 3442.5589999999997
look into that they just want to feel

3439.359 --> 3444.4
like they're the smart ones

3442.559 --> 3447.44
so they take

3444.4 --> 3448.799
things they know are difficult

3447.44 --> 3450.799
and they like

3448.799 --> 3453.839
shine it around like a trophy oh look at

3450.799 --> 3454.799
me i'm so smart because i can ramble off

3453.839 --> 3457.359
this

3454.799 --> 3459.119
little trixie to supposedly prove the

3457.359 --> 3461.2
earth is a ball and i can say it very

3459.119 --> 3463.119
eloquently it makes me sound so smart

3461.2 --> 3466.0
yeah but you don't actually understand

3463.119 --> 3469.2000000000003
what you're doing you never did

3466.0 --> 3471.04
you just wanted to use

3469.2 --> 3473.2799999999997
you wanted to get some social credit you

3471.04 --> 3475.52
wanted to seem smart that's always what

3473.28 --> 3477.119
it was that's what it is for all those

3475.52 --> 3478.799
people

3477.119 --> 3480.88
right if they're actually passionate

3478.799 --> 3481.839
about something they will

3480.88 --> 3484.079
then

3481.839 --> 3485.599
kind of nervously tell you like yeah

3484.079 --> 3488.4
there's something wrong like it might be

3485.599 --> 3490.88
it might be all wrong but yeah

3488.4 --> 3494.799
i'm gonna just go with it that's right

3490.88 --> 3495.76
which would be like an honest baller

3494.799 --> 3498.319
but

3495.76 --> 3501.0400000000004
most people that love this sort of stuff

3498.319 --> 3502.88
they use it for social credit they just

3501.04 --> 3505.599
want to seem very smart

3502.88 --> 3505.599
by knowing it

3506.24 --> 3508.319
or

3507.119 --> 3510.2400000000002
they

3508.319 --> 3513.04
kind of looked up against the people

3510.24 --> 3514.4799999999996
that taught them that seemed very smart

3513.04 --> 3516.16
right they don't even it doesn't

3514.48 --> 3517.52
necessarily even have to have to be

3516.16 --> 3519.5989999999997
about the ego

3517.52 --> 3521.839
it doesn't even have to be that

3519.599 --> 3524.2400000000002
they themselves are the smart ones i

3521.839 --> 3525.68
mean yeah the narcissists are like that

3524.24 --> 3527.7599999999998
absolutely

3525.68 --> 3528.8799999999997
some ballers

3527.76 --> 3532.2400000000002
they just

3528.88 --> 3535.28
wanna like the teacher that taught them

3532.24 --> 3538.9599999999996
about it they wanna

3535.28 --> 3541.44
like they're engaged with caring about

3538.96 --> 3543.52
their struggles of people in their past

3541.44 --> 3546.559
that have taught them these things so

3543.52 --> 3548.559
they will defend their old teachers

3546.559 --> 3550.1600000000003
right it doesn't always have to be about

3548.559 --> 3553.119
the ego and you're the smartest

3550.16 --> 3555.52
sometimes you just want to be able to

3553.119 --> 3558.079
respect people from your past and what

3555.52 --> 3560.319
they taught you

3558.079 --> 3561.2000000000003
but that also

3560.319 --> 3563.359
then

3561.2 --> 3564.72
prevents you from kind of looking deeper

3563.359 --> 3567.04
into it

3564.72 --> 3570.0
like were they actually right it's very

3567.04 --> 3572.88
unlikely that at the time in school

3570.0 --> 3574.72
that most people actually were checking

3572.88 --> 3576.4
their teachers like

3574.72 --> 3578.0789999999997
is this actually correct what's your

3576.4 --> 3581.839
source for that

3578.079 --> 3583.6800000000003
right i mean maybe at university level

3581.839 --> 3586.64
but even then you could get into trouble

3583.68 --> 3588.0
for that but at the regular school

3586.64 --> 3590.72
like

3588.0 --> 3594.16
when you're like 12 and between 12 and

3590.72 --> 3596.64
17 or something like very rarely

3594.16 --> 3599.359
people of that age actually check their

3596.64 --> 3602.0789999999997
teachers for like sources and integrity

3599.359 --> 3604.48
of the information they're teaching you

3602.079 --> 3606.1600000000003
because you're just absorbing things

3604.48 --> 3608.0
you're like either getting through

3606.16 --> 3609.7599999999998
school

3608.0 --> 3610.799
don't ask too many questions because

3609.76 --> 3612.88
you're only going to get a bigger

3610.799 --> 3614.88
headache right

3612.88 --> 3616.4
or

3614.88 --> 3618.96
yeah

3616.4 --> 3621.44
that you just don't pick it up you just

3618.96 --> 3623.599
trust like no it has to be real it's

3621.44 --> 3625.839
being taught in school so it has to be

3623.599 --> 3628.96
real that's what everybody thought it's

3625.839 --> 3631.2799999999997
what i thought i thought

3628.96 --> 3635.119
if it's being taught in school it has to

3631.28 --> 3637.76
be real otherwise it would be insane

3635.119 --> 3642.359
it would be crazy if schools were

3637.76 --> 3642.3590000000004
actually teaching things that are wrong

3645.2 --> 3648.319
well they are

3649.92 --> 3653.599
like

3651.76 --> 3657.6400000000003
just because something is being taught

3653.599 --> 3657.6400000000003
doesn't mean that it's true

3657.68 --> 3661.68
it just means it's part of the

3659.2 --> 3663.5989999999997
curriculum

3661.68 --> 3665.5989999999997
and sometimes there's even teachers with

3663.599 --> 3667.839
their own fringe ideas they'll teach

3665.599 --> 3670.96
that kind of on the side right as long

3667.839 --> 3672.72
as they get the curriculum correct

3670.96 --> 3674.48
and you might not even know that you

3672.72 --> 3678.0
might not even realize that they're

3674.48 --> 3680.799
grafting in their own ideas right

3678.0 --> 3683.04
if i'd become a teacher

3680.799 --> 3684.559
in my life if i'd officially chosen that

3683.04 --> 3687.4
i would have done that

3684.559 --> 3690.7200000000003
i would have had my own ideas about

3687.4 --> 3694.359
heliocentrism that i would be inserting

3690.72 --> 3694.359
i would do that

3704.48 --> 3710.319
happy new year davey little

3708.319 --> 3713.839
red sabbath

3710.319 --> 3713.839
06 what are you talking about

3726.16 --> 3731.5989999999997
yeah yeah yeah soaring dude i wanted to

3728.559 --> 3731.599
be an astronaut

3731.92 --> 3735.6800000000003
like constantly

3734.799 --> 3737.52
and then

3735.68 --> 3739.2799999999997
people basically told me yeah but it's

3737.52 --> 3742.0
fake it doesn't actually exist they're

3739.28 --> 3743.76
actors and i would be like

3742.0 --> 3745.76
what the [ __ ]

3743.76 --> 3747.76
why would you tell me you're trying to

3745.76 --> 3750.079
prevent me from becoming an astronaut

3747.76 --> 3752.7200000000003
are you you think i'm not smart enough

3750.079 --> 3755.039
that's what my response would be really

3752.72 --> 3757.52
i would really get pissed off

3755.039 --> 3760.7200000000003
because i just like no i can do that i

3757.52 --> 3763.2
can keep my focus i'm sharp

3760.72 --> 3766.5589999999997
i have the exact skills that would be

3763.2 --> 3766.5589999999997
necessary to do that

3767.28 --> 3770.2400000000002
like

3768.96 --> 3773.44
yeah

3770.24 --> 3775.359
i would have probably if it was real

3773.44 --> 3777.92
yeah i would have made a great astronaut

3775.359 --> 3777.92
i would have

3779.599 --> 3784.4
except maybe for claustrophobia but yeah

3786.799 --> 3790.319
but i wanted to give it a shot

3790.559 --> 3795.6800000000003
you know but yeah it's not real

3793.76 --> 3797.6800000000003
but it took me a long time to figure

3795.68 --> 3800.8799999999997
that out

3797.68 --> 3804.72
because to me it was just unspeakable

3800.88 --> 3804.7200000000003
that lies would just be taught

3806.799 --> 3810.88
i could not

3808.559 --> 3814.0
understand is like a real

3810.88 --> 3816.1600000000003
grave painful sin to me

3814.0 --> 3819.76
of the entire world

3816.16 --> 3819.7599999999998
what like you're gonna lie

3820.48 --> 3823.039
like that

3823.119 --> 3826.88
like in the very

3824.48 --> 3829.599
detailed foundations of our thinking

3826.88 --> 3832.1600000000003
you're gonna lie

3829.599 --> 3835.2000000000003
oh that that's always been monstrous a

3832.16 --> 3839.0389999999998
monstrous punishment to me

3835.2 --> 3839.7599999999998
it it actually gave me

3839.039 --> 3843.2000000000003
well

3839.76 --> 3845.8390000000004
temporary psychotic breaks at times

3843.2 --> 3848.72
temporary where that would immediately

3845.839 --> 3851.16
result in full-blown amnesia

3848.72 --> 3853.9199999999996
literally forget everything about it

3851.16 --> 3855.92
aggressively forget

3853.92 --> 3857.6800000000003
like amnesia where i'm like

3855.92 --> 3859.839
i don't remember this if you're gonna

3857.68 --> 3861.9199999999996
remind me about this i will punch you in

3859.839 --> 3863.68
the face so hard

3861.92 --> 3865.2000000000003
you're gonna have like fractures all

3863.68 --> 3867.7599999999998
over it

3865.2 --> 3871.0789999999997
that type of amnesia

3867.76 --> 3871.079
and it worked

3880.64 --> 3886.5589999999997
[Music]

3883.92 --> 3888.48
right but yeah one thing i didn't do at

3886.559 --> 3890.079
the time

3888.48 --> 3893.039
and that is

3890.079 --> 3895.92
go to the people that told me the earth

3893.039 --> 3898.079
was flat or that astronauts were fake

3895.92 --> 3900.96
and then attacked them how dare you tell

3898.079 --> 3900.96
me how dare you

3901.2 --> 3906.72
no that's not something i'd never done

3904.48 --> 3909.68
i would always take it like

3906.72 --> 3912.48
i'm a failure i actually believed it i

3909.68 --> 3914.3999999999996
can't handle not believing it

3912.48 --> 3917.359
i take the responsibility i take the

3914.4 --> 3918.799
blame and then go nuts

3917.359 --> 3920.4
and then forget about it and start

3918.799 --> 3922.48
believing again

3920.4 --> 3924.88
i would never blame those that would

3922.48 --> 3924.88
tell me

3925.839 --> 3929.2799999999997
unless they were patronizing to me about

3928.079 --> 3931.599
it like

3929.28 --> 3934.96
at the time when i was a baller if flat

3931.599 --> 3937.3590000000004
earthers would have patron been told me

3934.96 --> 3939.039
in a patronizing fashion i would have

3937.359 --> 3941.2
put them in the hospital

3939.039 --> 3942.96
i would have done that

3941.2 --> 3945.0389999999998
if you were going to be patronizing to

3942.96 --> 3947.2
me like some of these flat earthers

3945.039 --> 3950.6400000000003
right now out here

3947.2 --> 3953.5989999999997
on the scene and the way they behave

3950.64 --> 3955.44
like if i was those ballers dude

3953.599 --> 3958.1600000000003
i would probably be arrested all over

3955.44 --> 3960.96
the place because

3958.16 --> 3964.24
like from how i used to be from that

3960.96 --> 3968.2400000000002
perspective and then having a flat earth

3964.24 --> 3970.3999999999996
gamma scumbag be like that

3968.24 --> 3973.52
it's just

3970.4 --> 3975.359
that makes me savagely aggressive

3973.52 --> 3977.359
or it would have

3975.359 --> 3979.119
never really happened like that though

3977.359 --> 3981.5989999999997
people noticed that i was kind of

3979.119 --> 3981.599
dangerous

3983.039 --> 3985.76
like

3984.559 --> 3989.28
because of

3985.76 --> 3991.5200000000004
school trauma getting bullied

3989.28 --> 3993.76
and that just resulted in i keep

3991.52 --> 3996.079
defending keep defending

3993.76 --> 3998.079
try not to

3996.079 --> 4002.48
do anything really just like go through

3998.079 --> 4005.039
it and then i'd snap and literally just

4002.48 --> 4009.119
ravaging

4005.039 --> 4009.119
like throwing over tables and [ __ ]

4016.0 --> 4018.799
or like

4019.2 --> 4023.359
weirder stuff

4021.2 --> 4026.16
i would get kind of grabbly

4023.359 --> 4027.5989999999997
i i literally had times where i was just

4026.16 --> 4029.68
plotting

4027.599 --> 4032.079
how can i get this person into an

4029.68 --> 4032.0789999999997
accident

4032.24 --> 4037.52
really it's kind of creepy in retrospect

4035.039 --> 4039.2000000000003
but i i would become so obsessed and

4037.52 --> 4042.24
hateful

4039.2 --> 4043.9199999999996
for them just casually treating me like

4042.24 --> 4045.839
[ __ ]

4043.92 --> 4048.0
that i would actually start planning in

4045.839 --> 4050.64
my head like how how can i make them

4048.0 --> 4054.48
break their neck by accident

4050.64 --> 4056.319
how does that work how could i do that

4054.48 --> 4059.2
it's really creepy thinking back about

4056.319 --> 4061.92
that but yeah that's what happens when

4059.2 --> 4064.5589999999997
people are mercilessly humiliating

4061.92 --> 4067.52
towards you and disrespectful and don't

4064.559 --> 4069.6800000000003
even allow you to basically

4067.52 --> 4071.0389999999998
express yourself like a normal human

4069.68 --> 4073.9199999999996
being ever

4071.039 --> 4073.92
in their presence

4074.319 --> 4078.24
anyway

4075.76 --> 4080.1600000000003
it's all a long time ago

4078.24 --> 4082.799
i haven't really been that

4080.16 --> 4082.799
like dark

4083.119 --> 4087.52
for a long time

4084.88 --> 4089.359
not since my teens

4087.52 --> 4092.0
after that i started to figure out like

4089.359 --> 4095.2
wait this is actually dangerous

4092.0 --> 4096.88
you can't think like that because

4095.2 --> 4098.08
like you literally it's like being

4096.88 --> 4102.359
possessed

4098.08 --> 4102.359
being possessed by pure vengeance

4104.56 --> 4109.120000000001
like silent vengeance is very dangerous

4114.4 --> 4117.4
dude

4155.6 --> 4160.799
yeah you have reject social rejects

4160.08 --> 4163.679
well

4160.799 --> 4165.759
as well i was drawn to people that that

4163.679 --> 4168.0
it actually hurt right because you have

4165.759 --> 4170.0
like oh i'm social reject i'm such a

4168.0 --> 4173.52
special boy with my special hair in

4170.0 --> 4176.88
front of my eyes oh i'm spitting ugh

4173.52 --> 4178.799000000001
like gamma social rejects suck

4176.88 --> 4182.08
i don't give a [ __ ] i don't think

4178.799 --> 4183.12
they're cool for being anti-social [ __ ]

4182.08 --> 4184.3189999999995
you

4183.12 --> 4185.04
right

4184.319 --> 4187.120000000001
but

4185.04 --> 4189.12
people that would just be in the group

4187.12 --> 4191.2789999999995
and they would for some reason be picked

4189.12 --> 4193.04
out and then hammered on and they would

4191.279 --> 4195.120000000001
it would really hurt i would absolutely

4193.04 --> 4198.719
come to them like no no it's okay

4195.12 --> 4198.719
like they're unreasonable it's not you

4199.44 --> 4203.678999999999
i mean you have maybe some vulnerability

4202.48 --> 4204.48
issues and

4203.679 --> 4207.28
but

4204.48 --> 4209.678999999999
like no this is like i've been through

4207.28 --> 4212.08
that don't worry i would always be like

4209.679 --> 4213.52
helping them out because i really cared

4212.08 --> 4215.76
about that

4213.52 --> 4218.96
unless they're like completely

4215.76 --> 4220.64
perpetually panicking losers that could

4218.96 --> 4223.199
just never

4220.64 --> 4226.0
stop panicking i hate people that never

4223.199 --> 4227.599999999999
stop i genuinely hate them i'm sorry i

4226.0 --> 4230.48
know sometimes it's really a

4227.6 --> 4233.04
psychological thing you can't i can't

4230.48 --> 4236.239
stand people that cannot stop panicking

4233.04 --> 4239.12
i cannot stand them

4236.239 --> 4240.639999999999
right you're hurt it's one thing if you

4239.12 --> 4241.5199999999995
can't stop

4240.64 --> 4244.159000000001
just

4241.52 --> 4246.64
if you can't just stop panicking if you

4244.159 --> 4250.5599999999995
can't just become normal i don't want to

4246.64 --> 4250.56
