2.31 --> 9.46
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

6.37 --> 15.190000000000001
early-bird number 26 I'm your host

9.46 --> 16.32
Arwen yeah it's a beautiful day it is

15.19 --> 20.259
incredible

16.32 --> 25.15
it's almost like like a spring day it's

20.259 --> 31.950000000000003
really sunny nice and warm and clear

25.15 --> 41.199
skies don't expect that every December

31.95 --> 44.68
but yeah it's amazing weather yeah okay

41.199 --> 46.66
what can we talk about today for anyone

44.68 --> 54.089
decides to join which you can do through

46.66 --> 58.05
Skype as you well know yeah

54.089 --> 64.17999999999999
yesterday night really late nothing

58.05 --> 68.90899999999999
anyway it was late enough rasta dropped

64.18 --> 72.57900000000001
some links in the skype several places

68.909 --> 75.34
about a subject that definitely relates

72.579 --> 80.369
to alternative history and the month

75.34 --> 85.17
flood and the Atlantean civilization so

80.369 --> 87.46
yeah it's about the Grand Canyon and

85.17 --> 92.96900000000001
apparently there's a theory and there's

87.46 --> 96.25
videos about this that it's not really a

92.969 --> 101.33999999999999
naturally formed thing and that it

96.25 --> 105.61
actually is a very degraded ancient site

101.34 --> 108.43
it has similarities to the pyramids or

105.61 --> 111.219
at least so goes one of these theories

108.43 --> 114.28
and it's very interesting to see the

111.219 --> 117.729
interpretations as to the locations of

114.28 --> 120.039
these apparent structures that while

117.729 --> 122.579
they really do intuitively look like

120.039 --> 126.64
structures when you look up close

122.579 --> 130.509
there's some good footage of it and they

126.64 --> 132.94
seem to match constellations Orion again

130.509 --> 135.16
just like the pyramid so they theorize

132.94 --> 137.74
oh is it the same culture

135.16 --> 141.64
well yeah all of that comes from the

137.74 --> 145.09
same culture it's all the the Atlantean

141.64 --> 148.69
culture or you could perhaps call it the

145.09 --> 151.63
ultimate Babylonian culture maybe that

148.69 --> 154.12
story is even like more narrow down then

151.63 --> 157.75
it wasn't reality either maybe it was

154.12 --> 168.37
metaphorical anyway so many roads to go

157.75 --> 170.86
but yeah the there's just the land

168.37 --> 176.44
yeah these giant structures also again

170.86 --> 178.48000000000002
related to giants again these giant

176.44 --> 180.31
structures everywhere in the world I've

178.48 --> 182.67999999999998
been talking about this many times and

180.31 --> 187.36
they all have this stimulus similar

182.68 --> 191.35
trademark so that makes them of the same

187.36 --> 195.76000000000002
origin that's the most likely conclusion

191.35 --> 198.1
to draw from this and yeah I'm not

195.76 --> 202.98999999999998
surprised that they were also in America

198.1 --> 205.98999999999998
and one can speculate okay if the mud

202.99 --> 209.37
flood did take place and it probably did

205.99 --> 212.26000000000002
there's so much evidence of this then

209.37 --> 217.65
how hard did it actually hit America

212.26 --> 221.64999999999998
were these structures there before and

217.65 --> 225.52
they were basically like Machu Picchu

221.65 --> 230.23000000000002
like look at this ancient special unique

225.52 --> 232.81
site and they just chose not to make the

230.23 --> 238.62
world forget about it because it was

232.81 --> 241.54
inconvenient and probably some very deep

238.62 --> 247.39000000000001
geopolitical long-term strategy related

241.54 --> 250.66
decision so but apparently there it is

247.39 --> 253.01999999999998
also the Grand Canyon is not just a

250.66 --> 255.94
riverbed it seems there seem to be

253.02 --> 259.33
pyramidal like structures there and the

255.94 --> 261.459
funny thing is even though rust I

259.33 --> 264.37
brought it up yesterday and these videos

261.459 --> 268.979
now they seem to be around for a while

264.37 --> 275.59000000000003
I do remember them from a long time ago

268.979 --> 278.289
and I wasn't really into it back then

275.59 --> 283.27
when I heard about it and I thought it

278.289 --> 285.96999999999997
was so like a oh come on that too you

283.27 --> 289.50899999999996
know that kind of response so I forgot

285.97 --> 291.13000000000005
about it again because my mind was

289.509 --> 295.57
probably already overcrowded with a lot

291.13 --> 298.77
that I was being porn part over me at

295.57 --> 302.32
the time that I could barely handle and

298.77 --> 305.71
yeah now I see it and with everything

302.32 --> 308.289
I've learned it just yeah makes sense

305.71 --> 311.73999999999995
why not you know

308.289 --> 314.039
if the Atlantean Empire or the Atlantean

311.74 --> 319.389
civilization was in the entire realm

314.039 --> 322.05
potentially beyond then yeah why not

319.389 --> 325.63
America it's part of this realm isn't it

322.05 --> 328.36
so yeah there's another trace there that

325.63 --> 330.49
it's not just a very big continent that

328.36 --> 332.409
had nothing to do with the Atlanteans it

330.49 --> 335.289
they have touched America as well

332.409 --> 341.59
know North America not just South

335.289 --> 344.59
America and in Africa and Asia and by

341.59 --> 346.659
the way there's also the Bosnian pyramid

344.59 --> 349.599
it's a lot of controversy surrounding

346.659 --> 351.37
that thing it's like was always

349.599 --> 354.4
considered the mountain but it appears

351.37 --> 356.8
to be very pyramidal although it's not

354.4 --> 360.07
entirely conclusive yet in my opinion

356.8 --> 362.289
I'd really have to completely dig it out

360.07 --> 367.509
and basically restore it to confirm that

362.289 --> 369.96999999999997
and give us the layout to see if it is

367.509 --> 371.8
if it can perform the pyramidal function

369.97 --> 373.509
which would be the requirement for it to

371.8 --> 375.07
be built by the Atlanteans because they

373.509 --> 378.25
built them as tools not just as

375.07 --> 384.13
monuments or something just the fashion

378.25 --> 388.18
architecture so but yeah that's like in

384.13 --> 392.259
Europe is no not even that far east

388.18 --> 395.139
Europe so yeah of course

392.259 --> 397.45
in my opinion yeah sure there should be

395.139 --> 399.88
pyramids literally everywhere and we

397.45 --> 402.27
still we still may encounter them

399.88 --> 405.51
potentially underground

402.27 --> 410.68
so yeah they can literally be anywhere

405.51 --> 414.03
in our known realm and maybe even be so

410.68 --> 419.2
let's see wasn't Chet here hey Adam ikan

414.03 --> 421.9
it's an oakley see you of course

419.2 --> 427.99
earlier there was flat ball and rubik's

421.9 --> 433.57
and 8 a.m. then winfield blue compete

427.99 --> 434.02
mars yeah did you guys see the video as

433.57 --> 437.11
well

434.02 --> 447.99
it was also posted in the master beach

437.11 --> 454.14
and I think see no it wasn't right

447.99 --> 456.6
anyway yeah

454.14 --> 460.62
when you post the two videos Grand

456.6 --> 462.75
Canyon mystery and proof the Grand

460.62 --> 465.08
Canyon monuments are ancient

462.75 --> 468.6
those were the two video is not

465.08 --> 473.64
particularly the same type of angle

468.6 --> 475.98
approach but both pretty much yeah at

473.64 --> 479.21999999999997
the same subject and with slightly

475.98 --> 483.44
different angles to it so yeah check it

479.22 --> 483.44000000000005
out it's low flatlander

489.69 --> 497.39
ah so yeah Adam has seen it

492.87 --> 502.07
oh dear

497.39 --> 506.64
then Winfield apparently got porn bombed

502.07 --> 508.95
you gotta be careful dude that's why I'm

506.64 --> 511.5
careful you got to know who you got a

508.95 --> 513.5989999999999
trust or you gonna use or you have to

511.5 --> 520.26
use this cord otherwise that kind of

513.599 --> 525.6
shits gonna happen yeah yeah Adam agreed

520.26 --> 528.48
the timeline stuff is brutal especially

525.6 --> 533.94
yet there's the mud flood and there is

528.48 --> 534.87
the great flood way before but maybe the

533.94 --> 539.9300000000001
great flood

534.87 --> 546.51
oh my god yes

539.93 --> 549.53
maybe the grand canyon site was built

546.51 --> 554.4
after the great flood by remaining

549.53 --> 556.4599999999999
Atlantean splinter groups that basically

554.4 --> 561.4499999999999
formed the small Kingdom there in the

556.46 --> 563.22
Americas and later got defeated and the

561.45 --> 566.37
city was a remnant of it and then

563.22 --> 568.08
basically the new groups moved in maybe

566.37 --> 570.45
it's that kind of scenario maybe it

568.08 --> 573.9300000000001
wasn't actually Atlanteans but maybe it

570.45 --> 579.69
was a group of Atlanteans that survived

573.93 --> 582.3299999999999
the flood very very much intact with a

579.69 --> 587.82
lot of stuff that could be you know it

582.33 --> 591.0
doesn't can be excluded there's all kind

587.82 --> 594.72
of angles to it but it seems that it has

591.0 --> 596.79
been covered up by mud it's buried as it

594.72 --> 601.71
were and that's yeah that Coe insists

596.79 --> 605.55
with concepts like the mud and yeah now

601.71 --> 608.4000000000001
it's being pretty much there's a chance

605.55 --> 612.18
that it might actually be dug up at some

608.4 --> 613.41
points yeah if if Americans really

612.18 --> 615.03
wanted or if they're really interested

613.41 --> 617.2199999999999
or whatever they're gonna be planning

615.03 --> 620.18
but now maybe they're gonna do that so

617.22 --> 620.1800000000001
we'll see

623.93 --> 631.65
[Music]

626.61 --> 634.27
what about the Tartarian they were

631.65 --> 638.7099999999999
denied people they're here

634.27 --> 644.92
group that's that officially doesn't

638.71 --> 653.74
exist really anymore a lot of groups

644.92 --> 659.29
have been removed from history it's like

653.74 --> 663.13
a lot of groups probably had so many

659.29 --> 666.0699999999999
advantages that they'd rather just erase

663.13 --> 668.79
them then explain the culture because

666.07 --> 672.4000000000001
just learning about their culture would

668.79 --> 674.41
bring problems with the insights and the

672.4 --> 677.74
technology and whatever they're going to

674.41 --> 681.5799999999999
be using that will become evident and

677.74 --> 683.77
then yeah an opponent reading about that

681.58 --> 685.7700000000001
might get us and get some smart ideas

683.77 --> 688.81
from that so maybe they erased these

685.77 --> 696.06
cultures they defeated completely from

688.81 --> 699.67
history to prevents yeah prevent their

696.06 --> 704.6999999999999
their culture from vending itself from

699.67 --> 704.6999999999999
the inside as it were that kind of thing

709.51 --> 712.41
I don't know

718.35 --> 725.26
what

720.4 --> 735.1
dude what's up with you guys this

725.26 --> 743.35
morning it's gossip [ __ ] in my chest I

735.1 --> 746.41
don't want it stupid anyway guys if we

743.35 --> 753.73
can get back on track and stop talking

746.41 --> 760.15
about all this nonsense what do you guys

753.73 --> 764.62
think about the of the atlanteans or the

760.15 --> 769.63
empire the remnants who built the

764.62 --> 771.97
potential Grand Canyon yeah ancient

769.63 --> 774.55
buildings there what could it be could

771.97 --> 781.14
be the Atlanteans themselves or was it

774.55 --> 781.14
the people afterward or who do you think

783.939 --> 790.3489999999999
were the last occupy occupants of where

789.159 --> 795.22
the Incas

790.349 --> 799.589
maybe they yeah in South America they

795.22 --> 802.659
did have a lot of they did like use

799.589 --> 804.609
their pyramidal buildings they did

802.659 --> 807.309
occupy them even though they might not

804.609 --> 809.7090000000001
have originally built them or maybe they

807.309 --> 813.279
have in a primitive way with some it's

809.709 --> 817.8389999999999
hard to tell but maybe the Incas or

813.279 --> 821.439
something or another older Native empire

817.839 --> 824.6790000000001
occupy them that was actually more

821.439 --> 829.149
civilized than than that we are made of

824.679 --> 831.549
remember you know every time we think of

829.149 --> 834.129
Native Americans were always told that

831.549 --> 836.799
yeah okay there's like the more gentle

834.129 --> 838.629
kind and they're really brutal kind but

836.799 --> 842.169
there are always tribes and everything

838.629 --> 844.679
and they live in huts and well maybe

842.169 --> 846.759
there were actually some real

844.679 --> 851.7389999999999
civilizations out there they didn't live

846.759 --> 857.169
in huts and they have might have been

851.739 --> 859.479
erased because yeah that's like how do

857.169 --> 860.619
you say if you're just gonna take over

859.479 --> 864.5790000000001
barbarians

860.619 --> 866.789
yeah that's to a certain degree is it a

864.579 --> 870.279
good enough excuse historical

866.789 --> 873.929
historically for for a certain level of

870.279 --> 877.779
thinking certain layer of the population

873.929 --> 880.569
but if you really like destroy an entire

877.779 --> 883.229
civilization yeah and there's no excuse

880.569 --> 888.4889999999999
for that that's just freaking evil so

883.229 --> 892.3290000000001
maybe there was a more advanced Native

888.489 --> 896.139
American civilization back then and it

892.329 --> 903.0889999999999
was just dispatch as quickly as possible

896.139 --> 903.089
and then erased from history who knows

905.899 --> 912.349
okay P Mars if you continue this

908.699 --> 912.3489999999999
[ __ ] I'm just gonna ban you

931.54 --> 936.18
so stop being annoying

945.13 --> 955.57
great Italian Empire can you explain

951.64 --> 963.16
atom man dude giving the panel and talk

955.57 --> 967.5600000000001
about this the link is in the early bird

963.16 --> 967.56
chat you're in Skype you're in there so

975.029 --> 983.379
at work right so that you're saying the

980.949 --> 988.5999999999999
great dirt area empire lift alongside

983.379 --> 990.939
the Incas where where were they look you

988.6 --> 1004.889
know what what the hell I'll just look

990.939 --> 1014.569
it up on Google and math let's see what

1004.889 --> 1014.569
pops up what's known Google Maps okay Oh

1020.99 --> 1025.8700000000001
oh okay

1027.28 --> 1040.68
what is that okay that's like mmm

1036.689 --> 1044.1100000000001
North East Russian Empire I guessed

1040.68 --> 1048.8400000000001
Wow yeah let me present some of this

1044.11 --> 1056.02
it's pretty interesting to look at see

1048.84 --> 1061.06
so it's pretty big and this map it even

1056.02 --> 1063.58
if it's just complete Asia okay so that

1061.06 --> 1067.6599999999999
kind of makes sense in the sense that

1063.58 --> 1070.96
yeah it is said that the Chinese or

1067.66 --> 1073.39
Asians had that there is traces of their

1070.96 --> 1075.55
genetics in the Native Americans that

1073.39 --> 1078.67
they were part of it so they were next

1075.55 --> 1087.19
to it probably yeah

1078.67 --> 1091.03
peaceful exchange so it it was Incas the

1087.19 --> 1095.65
Incas were in in the south of North

1091.03 --> 1098.3999999999999
North America beyond Mexico oh wait

1095.65 --> 1103.51
that's that's true

1098.4 --> 1106.3600000000001
like Mexico even used to be like during

1103.51 --> 1111.87
the America there were like in America

1106.36 --> 1111.87
Mexico war support California even was

1112.14 --> 1130.1100000000001
Mexico so where where is presenting this

1118.2 --> 1134.77
where is the Grand Canyon see right

1130.11 --> 1138.6999999999998
that's pretty close

1134.77 --> 1140.8
yes that's kind of on the edge and the

1138.7 --> 1147.3400000000001
border it's oh okay I guess it could

1140.8 --> 1151.09
have been Inca it but that would be like

1147.34 --> 1153.07
a border city then unless you really do

1151.09 --> 1160.75
believe that the Incans were basically

1153.07 --> 1164.8899999999999
all over America but what about all the

1160.75 --> 1168.85
the tribes everywhere because there is

1164.89 --> 1173.3500000000001
just a historical detail about them even

1168.85 --> 1179.1
being kept by the current yea Native

1173.35 --> 1182.86
Americans society that all that thing so

1179.1 --> 1185.1999999999998
were the Native Americans the tribes

1182.86 --> 1189.79
basically part of the Incan Empire that

1185.2 --> 1193.72
have been falling apart or were they

1189.79 --> 1195.85
just really a different yeah were they

1193.72 --> 1198.72
outsiders not part of the Incan Empire

1195.85 --> 1198.7199999999998
what do you think Oh

1202.81 --> 1208.45
Adam says that tert area stretched into

1205.3 --> 1210.28
North America that's fascinating but the

1208.45 --> 1213.91
Grand Canyon is pretty far away from

1210.28 --> 1221.3799999999999
North America though there's a lot of

1213.91 --> 1223.9
mountains in between ok so if they were

1221.38 --> 1226.5100000000002
presumed next to each other if they were

1223.9 --> 1231.64
neighbors yeah then it is extremely

1226.51 --> 1235.09
likely that these these ancient things

1231.64 --> 1237.7
were occupied occupied not necessarily

1235.09 --> 1241.9199999999998
build that at least occupied and used by

1237.7 --> 1252.22
the Incans so it's just another Incan

1241.92 --> 1254.74
remnant felicity fascinating man like a

1252.22 --> 1257.53
long time ago when I heard about this I

1254.74 --> 1259.66
so could not get why this is interesting

1257.53 --> 1261.96
and now I so much get why this is

1259.66 --> 1261.96
interesting

1269.18 --> 1275.48
see a some people in chat

1276.08 --> 1289.07

medicine based and like really yeah I'm

1361.97 --> 1367.82
really hyper modernized its new

1364.31 --> 1370.78
approaches that it's not most people

don't even know about and just general

1370.78 --> 1378.53
herbology all that and yeah

1375.77 --> 1384.02
history alternative history what really

1378.53 --> 1387.11
happened of course flat earth and as

1384.02 --> 1394.43
part of cosmology and geometry and how

1387.11 --> 1399.6799999999998
do we know and other than that that's

1394.43 --> 1402.47
already a lot of subjects yeah just the

1399.68 --> 1404.51
big questions oh yeah sociology

psychology so yeah we deal with a lot of

1404.51 --> 1409.85
weirdo people gives us to look me and

1407.72 --> 1412.22

their behavior and see what's really

1412.22 --> 1420.53
going on and so yeah that also it's a

1418.58 --> 1423.1899999999998

1425.84 --> 1430.34
you want to talk about it during

1427.58 --> 1435.1999999999998
breakfast daily on the flat earth early

1430.34 --> 1438.04
bird and yeah if you're an American or

1435.2 --> 1442.13
if you're English

1438.04 --> 1447.23

1481.399 --> 1490.4289999999999
yeah the more the merrier Adam thanks

1489.019 --> 1494.98
for being my Ches always good to have

1490.429 --> 1494.98
you there got good leads

1505.6 --> 1513.59
right right right yes yes mud flood yeah

1511.0 --> 1516.68
after the mud flood the buildings that

1513.59 --> 1521.75
were built the mud flood coincided with

1516.68 --> 1525.5
basically a lot of erasing of technology

1521.75 --> 1528.77
technological advances especially in the

1525.5 --> 1530.78
craft so like crafts masters were

1528.77 --> 1534.92
removed because they knew too much and

1530.78 --> 1537.41
then the mechanization set in and the

1534.92 --> 1540.41
industrialization and so much knowledge

1537.41 --> 1542.3000000000002
was compartmentalized and there would no

1540.41 --> 1543.77
longer be any progress because of those

1542.3 --> 1545.6299999999999
people wouldn't figure it out anymore

1543.77 --> 1550.76
because of the compartmentalization

1545.63 --> 1553.91
and then patents and everything so yeah

1550.76 --> 1556.43
before the mud flood the buildings were

1553.91 --> 1557.27
sublime they were high technology they

1556.43 --> 1559.7
were amazing

1557.27 --> 1564.2
a lot of them were destroyed but some

1559.7 --> 1566.42
still remain so there's still these

1564.2 --> 1569.78
marvelous buildings out there they're

1566.42 --> 1571.97
just mind-blowing how they're built what

1569.78 --> 1574.16
their design really is and always

1571.97 --> 1577.43
mystical elements to them because they

1574.16 --> 1581.1200000000001
have been designed holistically with all

1577.43 --> 1583.97
the newly discovered ancient knowledge

1581.12 --> 1589.6399999999999
back in the day in mind so it was

1583.97 --> 1592.31
designed by a very a person that is a

1589.64 --> 1595.7900000000002
high technological insight about

1592.31 --> 1597.8
geometry about yeah what you can do with

1595.79 --> 1600.19
shapes and all that and the energies in

1597.8 --> 1605.06
the world so yeah these things are

1600.19 --> 1606.8300000000002
technological marvels of which the

1605.06 --> 1608.1799999999998
design knowledge is lost to us and

1606.83 --> 1612.4099999999999
there's still a lot of these buildings

1608.18 --> 1615.5
out there and they often eventually run

1612.41 --> 1619.99
into a restoration problems because some

1615.5 --> 1623.03
things just can't be replaced properly

1619.99 --> 1626.92
they can they can't recreate these

1623.03 --> 1629.57
certain things out that also happens and

1626.92 --> 1632.8100000000002
then sometimes they just decide to just

1629.57 --> 1635.21
trash the entire thing that's another

1632.81 --> 1637.6599999999999
horrifying crime against culture

1635.21 --> 1637.66
basically

1637.81 --> 1643.34
but yeah there are still plenty of

1640.76 --> 1646.93
buildings out there that were from

1643.34 --> 1649.6699999999998
before the flood and I just left and

1646.93 --> 1651.98
yeah good they will make good study

1649.67 --> 1657.28
objects for anyone who's interested and

1651.98 --> 1657.28
knows this right

1659.08 --> 1669.05
hello of David reading

1662.38 --> 1675.1100000000001
Danny Johnson sorry miss Cruz it's flat

1669.05 --> 1677.83
flat earther morning yeah I was the

1675.11 --> 1677.83
winner over there

1686.399 --> 1696.7589999999998
right it's so nice and sunny I'm almost

1694.869 --> 1698.619
like sitting in here like I don't want

1696.759 --> 1701.8600000000001
to be inside I just want to enjoy this

1698.619 --> 1705.07
Sun still there it's just such a rare

1701.86 --> 1707.4289999999999
thing during this time of year so I'm

1705.07 --> 1712.2
not even that talkative or am i doing

1707.429 --> 1712.2
I'll never shut up fully of course

1717.86 --> 1726.36
if any of you would like to help me out

1721.62 --> 1728.25
and just come on and help me have an

1726.36 --> 1730.78
interesting conversation that would be

1728.25 --> 1733.88
very nice

1730.78 --> 1733.8799999999999
[Music]

1751.299 --> 1760.61
David read you're trying to bring sense

1753.86 --> 1762.9189999999999
to feed Mars like there's probably

1760.61 --> 1766.52
people that have said this thousands of

1762.919 --> 1770.3300000000002
times now over the years the guys

1766.52 --> 1775.04
completely stuck probably literally even

1770.33 --> 1785.4189999999999
that weird little room of it so I know

1775.04 --> 1787.19
thank God I can stay but the other and I

1785.419 --> 1791.15
have been thinking also like yeah you

1787.19 --> 1792.95
know what this webcam setup it's it's

1791.15 --> 1799.8400000000001
pretty decent it's okay

1792.95 --> 1804.0800000000002
could be a lot worse but maybe just for

1799.84 --> 1807.23
media reasons I should get like a mobile

1804.08 --> 1810.47
phone properly with a camera but that

1807.23 --> 1812.09
could perform live stream functions that

1810.47 --> 1817.25
would be kind of interesting because I

1812.09 --> 1820.37
could just take you places and talk

1817.25 --> 1822.5
about things that way but yeah then I'd

1820.37 --> 1824.8999999999999
have to get one of those freaking phones

1822.5 --> 1830.48
and I'm not too enthusiastic about that

1824.9 --> 1832.88
so maybe not so soon maybe later but I

1830.48 --> 1835.01
think I will put oh let's just say it

1832.88 --> 1839.63
like this in my visions I've seen myself

1835.01 --> 1841.73
do that and being really used to it so I

1839.63 --> 1844.7
will probably end up doing that but it

1841.73 --> 1846.83
might take a while for now you're gonna

1844.7 --> 1849.94
be stuck with me sitting in this room

1846.83 --> 1849.9399999999998
every day

1857.14 --> 1868.8500000000001
how Eric don't be so mean he doesn't

1863.12 --> 1871.07
sell anything he just says stuff and

1868.85 --> 1881.3
he's not even good at it's just more

1871.07 --> 1884.6299999999999
like a verbal spammer yep and he has

1881.3 --> 1889.52
moods doesn't mean that I'd like people

1884.63 --> 1899.65
like really brutal and against him that

1889.52 --> 1899.65
song do Tony damn Eric come on

1906.58 --> 1913.07
you know he'll mentally ill people by

1910.28 --> 1919.21
getting really angry and savage with

1913.07 --> 1919.21
them doesn't work it's medically proven

1933.84 --> 1936.559
true

1938.78 --> 1945.41
but look it's very you have to be

1941.36 --> 1950.51
practical about this if this guy opposes

1945.41 --> 1956.9
us opposes the truth that we figured out

1950.51 --> 1960.17
that we defend against the world and all

1956.9 --> 1962.0900000000001
these indoctrinated people yeah you're

1960.17 --> 1965.69
gonna have to realize that even if he is

1962.09 --> 1970.8799999999999
real it's better to be a decent person

1965.69 --> 1973.22
and just respect them for the level of a

1970.88 --> 1976.13
mentally ill person and not get evil on

1973.22 --> 1977.84
them because anyone watching maybe just

1976.13 --> 1981.23
a second or a snippet or maybe it's

1977.84 --> 1983.4499999999998
later it's gonna be brought up again the

1981.23 --> 1987.23
example will be look a mentally ill

1983.45 --> 1989.8400000000001
people I wish you this [ __ ] get brutal

1987.23 --> 1994.15
on them that's gonna look very bad so

1989.84 --> 1998.4199999999998
you don't want to have that contrast be

1994.15 --> 2000.76
around anywhere anytime in association

1998.42 --> 2003.73
with yourself because that's yeah we

2000.76 --> 2008.71
have these feelings of frustration but

2003.73 --> 2012.88
we're also a public face for this under

2008.71 --> 2016.69
fire movement that still has some

2012.88 --> 2019.45
freedom amazingly not totally being

2016.69 --> 2023.8
censored not completely just being

2019.45 --> 2028.72
pushed in a corner but yeah if you're

2023.8 --> 2032.9199999999998
gonna get all violent and angry then

2028.72 --> 2034.21
that's only gonna get worse just say so

2032.92 --> 2037.3300000000002
don't be an idiot

2034.21 --> 2039.67
control yourself of discipline let the

2037.33 --> 2046.86
mentally ill people be mentally ill

2039.67 --> 2046.8600000000001
people and deal with it yourself

2051.84 --> 2060.69
ha I agree on that Apolo ends in there

2055.56 --> 2063.81
are a much more decently natured people

2060.69 --> 2068.31
so yeah they do deserve much more

2063.81 --> 2069.84
it doesn't mean yeah well I said what I

2068.31 --> 2073.04
said and I'm gonna repeat it oh it's

2069.84 --> 2073.04
very obvious

2088.74 --> 2098.8289999999997
so you know be Mars this weirdo yes

2095.7 --> 2102.009
absolutely nothing to contribute to any

2098.829 --> 2106.059
learning process so far really hasn't

2102.009 --> 2110.43
except for psychological study that's

2106.059 --> 2114.849
like the only thing that's to be gained

2110.43 --> 2123.3689999999997
because content he's and he's just a

2114.849 --> 2126.819
parrot and drown hey and about the

2123.369 --> 2130.539
sniping and everything he does hey if

2126.819 --> 2132.549
you know it do with it just know like

2130.539 --> 2136.869
yeah you can't trust him doesn't mean

2132.549 --> 2139.349
you have to be addictive even well even

2136.869 --> 2142.1800000000003
if he is being a dick to everyone or you

2139.349 --> 2147.579
it's better to just treat him like a

2142.18 --> 2151.72
mentally ill person and just calm down

2147.579 --> 2154.9500000000003
now that's what I try to do because that

2151.72 --> 2154.95
works a lot better

2187.34 --> 2202.42
and I really just want to enjoy the

2190.88 --> 2202.42
wedding right now guys

2245.26 --> 2248.26
right

2261.3 --> 2267.3
let's see cool

2272.51 --> 2281.5890000000004
yeah that's the funny thing isn't it

2274.28 --> 2284.96
about Flat Earth people come around but

2281.589 --> 2288.95
they usually come around in a different

2284.96 --> 2292.16
way when you actually know them and are

2288.95 --> 2295.49
engaging in any friendship with

2292.16 --> 2298.22
elaborate communications then it takes a

2295.49 --> 2302.3289999999997
long time sometimes it doesn't work out

2298.22 --> 2304.25
the usually doesn't go very fast unless

2302.329 --> 2306.5890000000004
the person has already been pondering on

2304.25 --> 2308.75
it it's basically just waiting to cross

2306.589 --> 2311.48
the line as it worries like looking for

2308.75 --> 2314.57
an excuse to do it but usually it just

2311.48 --> 2316.16
takes a long time on the other hand if

2314.57 --> 2318.38
you don't know a person and if you're

2316.16 --> 2321.44
just throwing it out there like

2318.38 --> 2323.3
advertising it out there or just walking

2321.44 --> 2329.41
up to people and just ahead isn't that

2323.3 --> 2329.4100000000003
that's an entirely different effect so

2332.92 --> 2341.03
because if you don't have a bonding

2336.05 --> 2346.55
friendship then often the impulse will

2341.03 --> 2350.21
not outlive the counter response see

2346.55 --> 2353.3900000000003
because we counter the condition counter

2350.21 --> 2355.25
responds if you have a friendship then

2353.39 --> 2358.2799999999997
at first if they confront you with

2355.25 --> 2361.52
flatter than the condition counter

2358.28 --> 2363.7400000000002
response will be like oh but hey if you

2361.52 --> 2366.8
kind of like them yeah you'll tolerate

2363.74 --> 2369.2599999999998
it for the sake of the potential

2366.8 --> 2372.38
friendship because he's more he knows

2369.26 --> 2377.599
more you like to learn about so you just

2372.38 --> 2379.94
hang in there and that allows it to then

2377.599 --> 2382.6400000000003
slowly sink in despite the conditioning

2379.94 --> 2385.64
because you will listen not because she

2382.64 --> 2387.7999999999997
in the first place want to know about it

2385.64 --> 2392.45
but because you want to respect the

2387.8 --> 2395.119
person talking and that way you can to a

2392.45 --> 2396.5299999999997
certain degree bypass the conditioning

2395.119 --> 2400.04
because you will just learn the details

2396.53 --> 2402.6800000000003
and then as if the opportunity is there

2400.04 --> 2403.94
you may certainly just realize like oh

2402.68 --> 2405.79
[ __ ]

2403.94 --> 2409.18
that's what it

2405.79 --> 2412.8089999999997
then I didn't see it and now I suddenly

2409.18 --> 2414.16
get it but yeah if you just bump into

2412.809 --> 2416.829
somebody on the street and just say do

2414.16 --> 2421.24
you look this yeah they will they'll not

2416.829 --> 2423.46
have a reason to basically bypass the

2421.24 --> 2425.68
conditioned response unless you're

2423.46 --> 2427.93
really really impressive and really

2425.68 --> 2431.44
really likeable if you have that super

2427.93 --> 2437.14
strong energy then yeah you might do it

2431.44 --> 2440.23
but if you really know somebody or if

2437.14 --> 2442.089
you're engaging in a longer potential

2440.23 --> 2447.55
friendship or something talking in the

2442.089 --> 2453.0299999999997
friendship then I think the likelihood

2447.55 --> 2456.069
of success is much greater that way and

2453.03 --> 2459.55
they will also potentially be able to

2456.069 --> 2463.5099999999998
overcome the obstacles we have because

2459.55 --> 2466.119
we have already went there and so we can

2463.51 --> 2468.1600000000003
basically very quickly answer the very

2466.119 --> 2471.4300000000003
complex specific question that will

2468.16 --> 2477.16
naturally pop up and really help them

2471.43 --> 2480.3689999999997
very fast on their way so yeah all

2477.16 --> 2483.8489999999997
depends on how much you know of course

2480.369 --> 2486.52
when you do it but explaining it to

2483.849 --> 2490.29
friends slowly tends to work a lot

2486.52 --> 2490.29
better in my personal experience

2493.26 --> 2499.0400000000004
I artists Liebherr Alice chocolates sane

2507.42 --> 2510.9300000000003
Sabrina browning

2512.97 --> 2515.97
and

2520.599 --> 2528.6690000000003
yeah there's only 45 minutes left

2526.329 --> 2530.699
oh [ __ ] there's only like 15 minutes

2528.669 --> 2534.009
left on the show huh

2530.699 --> 2535.929
I'm just gonna keep it so otherwise it's

2534.009 --> 2539.049
gonna expand way too long

2535.929 --> 2547.719
hey Karen be good morning

2539.049 --> 2550.749
oh right

2547.719 --> 2553.179
yeah I five artists Liebherr Ella Sian

2550.749 --> 2561.509
wrenched almost everyone except for it

2553.179 --> 2565.63
just a few like two people and Adam and

2561.509 --> 2569.309
and Nathan for practical purposes so

2565.63 --> 2569.309
they can basically post links

2582.02 --> 2590.0
fake Antonia and Antonia super it

2587.0 --> 2590.0
belongs

2599.92 --> 2608.2400000000002
now chuckling now the the issue also is

2606.29 --> 2613.6
why I don't want to keep give people

2608.24 --> 2613.6
wrenches is because yeah that'll only

2613.93 --> 2619.04
yeah you know the trolls I don't want

2616.76 --> 2622.76
every single one of them blocked I just

2619.04 --> 2625.31
want them to behave like globus but just

2622.76 --> 2628.4900000000002
not too bad and that's much more amusing

2625.31 --> 2630.68
but if you're gonna like ban people then

2628.49 --> 2632.18
they will typically try to lure you out

2630.68 --> 2634.31
to bend them and everything then

2632.18 --> 2638.0
eventually I'll just have a flat earth

2634.31 --> 2640.61
only public left or something and you

2638.0 --> 2647.69
know let's just do it like this

2640.61 --> 2650.6
oh cool five hearts liberality yeah he

2647.69 --> 2659.86
knows something else about the Bosnian

2650.6 --> 2659.86
pyramids thanks for sharing it huh

2663.27 --> 2671.7
Wow that is fascinating that is

2669.21 --> 2675.2
absolutely fascinating okay so five

2671.7 --> 2678.3599999999997
artists Eber Allah says that apparently

2675.2 --> 2681.3599999999997
the Bosnia peer Bosnian pyramid really

2678.36 --> 2684.51
is a pyramid apparently much more much

2681.36 --> 2686.84
more certainty than I'm saying and that

2684.51 --> 2692.9700000000003
it was apparently covered with concrete

2686.84 --> 2698.7000000000003
but not of a known type so maybe this

2692.97 --> 2701.2799999999997
concrete was a invention from yeah it

2698.7 --> 2703.14
was a concrete maybe even newly

2701.28 --> 2705.78
discovered but they it was just

2703.14 --> 2712.2
functioning better because it was pre

2705.78 --> 2715.65
month so yeah of course this pre mud

2712.2 --> 2719.0099999999998
flood empire probably just had pyramid

2715.65 --> 2721.29
freaking everywhere and they just left

2719.01 --> 2724.71
them there as ornaments but some of it

2721.29 --> 2726.69
may even have been causing trouble so

2724.71 --> 2730.08
they just covered it up with concrete

2726.69 --> 2734.04
just like okay let's just forget about

2730.08 --> 2738.38
that one you can't go in there it's too

2734.04 --> 2738.38
dangerous or something it's fascinating

2754.45 --> 2761.6699999999996
yeah Charles seem to be active today

2764.96 --> 2768.11
[Music]

2780.55 --> 2790.19
the ancient worlds it is it is kind of

2787.1 --> 2793.91
like a second archaeology isn't it all

2790.19 --> 2798.79
of this rediscovering history first we

2793.91 --> 2803.72
get in it politicized history

2798.79 --> 2806.0
indoctrinated and now we're discovering

2803.72 --> 2813.95
the real history once again it's a new

2806.0 --> 2816.2
phase of archeology new approach oh yeah

2813.95 --> 2817.37
by the way I have it yeah before I ran

2816.2 --> 2821.39
out to show I had an interesting

2817.37 --> 2825.58
conversation with a new neighbor a new

2821.39 --> 2825.58
guy moved in and guess what he studies

2825.73 --> 2836.06
geology specific of the earth

2830.24 --> 2838.7799999999997
measuring kind in the field a well that

2836.06 --> 2841.34
is gonna be really interesting and

2838.78 --> 2843.65
although I didn't break flat earth like

2841.34 --> 2847.19
on the first meeting for a neighbor yeah

2843.65 --> 2850.37
you don't wanna do that but I did have a

2847.19 --> 2853.25
long conversation about geology and I

2850.37 --> 2855.35
even brought up the concept of the

2853.25 --> 2856.31
molten iron core didn't even bring up

2855.35 --> 2858.92
like we will globe

2856.31 --> 2862.37
versus flat not just like what is your

2858.92 --> 2865.82
proof and we talked about tectonics how

2862.37 --> 2871.7
yeah apparently there do seem to be some

2865.82 --> 2873.5
kind of shifting of pieces surface

2871.7 --> 2876.68
pieces of the earth there is movement

2873.5 --> 2880.7
there in specific patterns correlating

2876.68 --> 2883.31
with certain volcanoes but what actually

2880.7 --> 2885.7999999999997
does cause that it's another one of

2883.31 --> 2887.72
these weird mysteries what is causing

2885.8 --> 2888.17
that and I even laid out my theory to

2887.72 --> 2890.48
him

2888.17 --> 2893.21
and I think that volcanoes could

2890.48 --> 2895.4
potentially just be local could be

2893.21 --> 2898.9900000000002
created by a naturally occurring

2895.4 --> 2902.7200000000003
induction coil mechanism that is heating

2898.99 --> 2907.52
through yeah induction coil style

2902.72 --> 2911.6299999999997
electricity for some reason causing

2907.52 --> 2913.52
laughi to melt and stay melted and also

2911.63 --> 2914.779
of course cause pressure because of this

2913.52 --> 2916.999
it's logical

2914.779 --> 2918.259
cuz it's gonna heat up it's gonna expand

2916.999 --> 2924.049
within Iraq

2918.259 --> 2926.029
so yeah expansion is logical but yeah I

2924.049 --> 2928.64
brought forth this theory and he was

2926.029 --> 2932.15
just like still trying to recover from

2928.64 --> 2936.3489999999997
me even doubting the official narrative

2932.15 --> 2941.169
into which he is now still doing his

2936.349 --> 2944.089
studies like in in his first year so I

2941.169 --> 2946.219
hope I don't it caused him to fail

2944.089 --> 2949.729
because he gets confused and I probably

2946.219 --> 2951.949
just stop talking about it with me but I

2949.729 --> 2953.3289999999997
hope to have some more conversations

2951.949 --> 2957.529
with this guy because it's really

2953.329 --> 2959.809
fascinating and he also will over the

2957.529 --> 2963.979
course of time have more knowledge about

2959.809 --> 2966.469
equipment and do fieldwork and then just

2963.979 --> 2968.4489999999996
man I want to know a guy like that and

2966.469 --> 2970.219
just hear about what he's been doing

2968.449 --> 2972.619
like where if you scan how deep did you

2970.219 --> 2974.869
go I also brought up like yeah people

2972.619 --> 2979.2490000000003
haven't actually dug further than eight

2974.869 --> 2982.369
kilometers and was just Rock and of

2979.249 --> 2983.779
course the hydrogen gas and he didn't

2982.369 --> 2985.759
have an answer to that it just says yeah

2983.779 --> 2986.479
but volcanoes and yeah where is that

2985.759 --> 2989.569
coming from

2986.479 --> 2994.249
yeah we don't know so much we don't

2989.569 --> 2996.2889999999998
really understand because that's just

2994.249 --> 2999.499
the world is full of mysteries and this

2996.289 --> 3002.7090000000003
globe religion is there to give us all

2999.499 --> 3007.8089999999997
the answers based on a giant conceptual

3002.709 --> 3009.64
model it's all just nonsense it's all

3007.809 --> 3013.8390000000004
science fiction it's science fiction

3009.64 --> 3018.209
answers like a religion but very

3013.839 --> 3022.209
obviously not true in a lot of aspects

3018.209 --> 3024.8489999999997
most aspects about it it's basically the

3022.209 --> 3028.1189999999997
religion part is the lies that fill in

3024.849 --> 3032.1690000000003
the yeah fill in the gaps of knowledge

3028.119 --> 3034.359
in truth and there's a lot of it then of

3032.169 --> 3036.939
course we've already went on the path to

3034.359 --> 3039.969
finding a new route and more truth to

3036.939 --> 3042.489
fill it up but there are still a lot of

3039.969 --> 3045.7200000000003
gaps that things that are just dying

3042.489 --> 3048.78
mysteries like to having the bodies and

3045.72 --> 3053.2799999999997
yeah and how does law have I come into

3048.78 --> 3059.28
existence and how far up does it go and

3053.28 --> 3062.6400000000003
how much land is out there and is our

3059.28 --> 3067.17
earth realm spatially linear or is it

3062.64 --> 3069.9
not all these mysteries still yet to be

3067.17 --> 3072.48
found out and they can be found out

3069.9 --> 3077.28
potentially one step at a time as long

3072.48 --> 3082.289
as we get the opportunity so yeah I will

3077.28 --> 3084.9
be cool to have this guy maybe hey if

3082.289 --> 3087.119
you want if he'd like bring him on the

3084.9 --> 3092.21
show but probably not gonna happen with

3087.119 --> 3092.21
this night yeah it's too mr. green

3162.079 --> 3168.539
sometime oh and on the request anyway so

3166.13 --> 3172.079
I'll be on the flat earth debates right

3168.539 --> 3174.0
after this as usual and I'll be back

3172.079 --> 3179.619
tomorrow with flat earth early bird

3174.0 --> 3182.369
number 27 so until then keep it

3179.619 --> 3182.369
not
