[Music]

31.46 --> 33.519
you

38.449 --> 46.099999999999994
Oh morning welcome to Flat Earth

42.8 --> 48.108999999999995
early-bird number 566 I'm your host

46.1 --> 49.789
Arwen and before I start to show please

64.25 --> 68.689
membership system join button that will

66.74 --> 71.96
be much appreciated and kind of needed

68.689 --> 73.369
and yet membership also yeah it gives

71.96 --> 76.61
you special access to the membership

73.369 --> 80.299
only videos so please do support me

76.61 --> 84.38
getting to the middle of the month

80.299 --> 87.25
anyway the weather today yeah as I said

84.38 --> 91.88
before every day another type of weather

87.25 --> 95.539
and now it's yeah it's pretty sunny and

91.88 --> 98.69
beautiful today has been all morning

95.539 --> 103.159
really it was even sunnier in the

98.69 --> 106.869
morning I got up extremely early as I

103.159 --> 109.869
went to bed really early as well and

106.869 --> 109.869
yeah

111.039 --> 117.07900000000001
sort of enjoy the morning I guess though

114.979 --> 125.03
yeah my feelings are going all over the

117.079 --> 127.15899999999999
place again and this time yeah I

125.03 --> 132.14000000000001
happened to bump into somebody again

127.159 --> 135.53
over to chat at Nathan Thompson just

132.14 --> 137.14999999999998
basically tried yeah hang around thought

135.53 --> 139.489
I was gonna have some fun maybe even

137.15 --> 141.53
join the show or something because he

139.489 --> 144.41
was live-streaming it was really early

141.53 --> 150.739
for me but I was wide awake and but then

144.41 --> 154.16
like Bob globe Busters came in and it

150.739 --> 156.829
was just you just being Bob but then

154.16 --> 158.959
yeah you started to basically try to for

156.829 --> 162.19
some reason counter my arguments

158.959 --> 166.519
concerning gravity and the dome and

162.19 --> 167.79
started to shame qe and Nathan and that

166.519 --> 172.64000000000001
really hit me in the raw

167.79 --> 172.64
way so that kind of ruined my mood

179.629 --> 185.04
cloudy weather in Germany okay I didn't

183.54 --> 189.72
know how long this is gonna last but

185.04 --> 192.87
it's been pretty sunny so far anyway I

189.72 --> 198.04
got green tea with me

192.87 --> 201.87
i hadn´t some Tamera coffee

198.04 --> 208.16899999999998
[Music]

201.87 --> 211.769
hey you Resta yeah Oh were you in that

208.169 --> 219.06
chat Missouri Bear I didn't I don't know

211.769 --> 222.31900000000002
good could be but yeah it's just just

219.06 --> 222.319
sick even thinking about it

225.049 --> 233.97
whoa really Bank okay thanks uh yeah I

230.459 --> 237.54
will check it very appreciate it

233.97 --> 239.28
I'm still just yeah I almost threw up

237.54 --> 243.629
this morning like with an empty stomach

239.28 --> 246.75
it's a pretty messed-up feeling your

243.629 --> 248.819
stress and [ __ ] I get it a lot in the

246.75 --> 253.109
morning and just yesterday and today

248.819 --> 256.049
it's been kind of bad it's it's so weird

253.109 --> 257.94
because it kind of yeah comes out of

256.049 --> 261.299
nowhere I just wake up and I think oh

257.94 --> 265.88
that's all nice and then suddenly I just

261.299 --> 265.88
get sick I don't know where

269.63 --> 276.48
but anyway yeah it might be a bit slow

273.81 --> 279.06
because of that until I get my momentum

276.48 --> 282.56
because I'm just all flustered and it's

279.06 --> 285.42
in it's kind of warm it's really warm

282.56 --> 287.37
it'll be better like in an hour I'm

285.42 --> 290.40000000000003
pretty sure anyway let's go through chap

287.37 --> 295.77
I think HM was first Ryan

290.4 --> 296.52
artherton Amanda you'll dank Robin

295.77 --> 300.03
Stanley

296.52 --> 304.79999999999995
I'm sorry bear over McCall stop traffic

300.03 --> 309.79999999999995
I'm arrest I had Steve cuz I hate that

304.8 --> 313.62
Cosentino Paul her flat confused okay

309.8 --> 317.18
acaba yeah I think I got got them all

313.62 --> 317.18
it's Friday of course

334.26 --> 337.52
yeah honey koala

349.01 --> 367.46999999999997
this a thousand cars to buy a ps5 yeah

358.28 --> 369.83
okay wait there's a ps5 this didn't even

367.47 --> 369.83000000000004
know that

374.889 --> 377.639
okay

378.23 --> 383.97
baller flat confused okay if you're

381.12 --> 388.38
actually a genuine person trying to

383.97 --> 390.45000000000005
explore yeah sure your your in this is a

388.38 --> 393.09
good place to start out

390.45 --> 397.28999999999996
after being being through the initials

393.09 --> 399.39
as you as it were I would also recommend

397.29 --> 401.42
you go watch Flat Earth debates after

399.39 --> 405.27
this it's a little bit more hardcore

401.42 --> 407.31
it's more stricter to the point but I

405.27 --> 411.69
promise you'll learn something there if

407.31 --> 413.07
you can if you can hold on because

411.69 --> 421.32
things can get a little stressful

413.07 --> 423.42
sometimes especially for ballers did I

421.32 --> 425.43
happen to see Anthony's Becca fourth

423.42 --> 428.54
with the geometry professor no I haven't

425.43 --> 428.54
seen that Missouri bear

435.999 --> 443.259
well he had what that's yeah that's my

441.309 --> 445.92900000000003
initial thought as well but you never

443.259 --> 449.259
really know these days I didn't see him

445.929 --> 451.679
say anything terrible so far so we'll

449.259 --> 451.67900000000003
see what happens

458.98 --> 465.39000000000004
ah okay stuff ik traffic of arrests at

469.21 --> 474.63899999999995
right thank I think he probably did

471.729 --> 476.68
watch that it look that video is on

474.639 --> 486.97
there at the base like front page so

476.68 --> 490.27
yeah oh oh there you go yeah that's

486.97 --> 494.199
already the the type of questions yeah

490.27 --> 497.34999999999997
that are kind of suspect because if you

494.199 --> 499.68
still have to ask all that after you've

497.35 --> 502.15000000000003
watched Eric Dubay is two hundred proofs

499.68 --> 504.33
then you haven't really paid any

502.15 --> 504.33
attention

511.63 --> 517.21
but I don't know maybe if you're not

514.78 --> 521.14
there yet if you need to see some more

517.21 --> 522.729
you still think it's a planet then maybe

521.14 --> 526.77
you should just watch the Flat Earth

522.729 --> 526.7700000000001
debates for a while

544.55 --> 553.12
six month of fe b before you come in wow

550.01 --> 553.12
that's a lot

559.63 --> 566.23
the bottom floor of the universe hmm

563.79 --> 569.88
never thought of it like that dank I

566.23 --> 569.88
guess you could call it that

572.53 --> 576.64
[Music]

590.76 --> 595.85
right

593.209 --> 601.6389999999999
or or you could just state that the

595.85 --> 608.6890000000001
earth realm is the universe or the

601.639 --> 611.389
middle part it's very likely to be at

608.689 --> 614.319
least somewhere near the middle of the

611.389 --> 614.319
realms confines

627.15 --> 632.86
every day we'll send any normal person

630.07 --> 634.48
straight to the loony bin well I don't

632.86 --> 638.95
know what you consider as a normal

634.48 --> 642.7
person but yeah it'll definitely push

638.95 --> 646.63
some buttons it will drive you on on

642.7 --> 648.82
offense if you've got some yeah if

646.63 --> 653.2
you're not completely aware of the

648.82 --> 656.0200000000001
situation but you had to call that a

653.2 --> 658.2700000000001
normal person I don't know I think a

656.02 --> 665.4399999999999
Normie that would watch it would just be

658.27 --> 668.86
like what and just be probably a little

665.44 --> 671.74
bit confused for a while and then I

668.86 --> 674.53
don't know maybe it'll sink in maybe you

671.74 --> 676.6
want maybe they'll get out paranoid

674.53 --> 681.49
thinking that it's like this inside out

676.6 --> 684.0600000000001
world evil you know that that happens to

681.49 --> 684.0600000000001
some ballers

694.51 --> 700.0
I always hear you're talking about

696.55 --> 701.9499999999999
looping can you please explain oh dear

700.0 --> 709.71
said either cuz a teen oh well that's

701.95 --> 714.19
the looping part is another layout

709.71 --> 720.63
conception of the earth realm yeah

714.19 --> 727.2600000000001
because if you basically presuppose that

720.63 --> 727.26
yeah the material realm as we know it is

727.29 --> 734.89
basically not infinite and then cut off

731.38 --> 738.1899999999999
by a literal barrier in some way then

734.89 --> 741.9399999999999
yeah there but you rather regard it as

738.19 --> 747.58
if it were a simulated space so similar

741.94 --> 749.7700000000001
torii like a a set 3d space within a

747.58 --> 752.5300000000001
computer game used for the computer

749.77 --> 754.81
games parameters for example now that

752.53 --> 758.73
would be a conception that would bring

754.81 --> 762.4599999999999
you a step nearer to understanding what

758.73 --> 764.83
looping would be because yeah you could

762.46 --> 766.72
make it like a literal Box in in the

764.83 --> 768.85
game you know when you said when you

766.72 --> 772.57
make that simulated space or you could

768.85 --> 775.12
just say now it's just gonna yeah left

772.57 --> 777.45
to right it's gonna connect so if you

775.12 --> 781.15
just walk over there you literally just

777.45 --> 784.09
yeah you keep on walking and it's it's

781.15 --> 788.05
just connected because the limited space

784.09 --> 791.71
is interconnected or also known as

788.05 --> 796.9799999999999
looping in on itself it's just a

791.71 --> 800.61
continual space with a set volume and

796.98 --> 803.65
that makes it effectively looping now if

800.61 --> 807.4300000000001
you open up to the possibility that that

803.65 --> 808.84
could exist which is kind of tough you

807.43 --> 813.04
know especially like oh where's the

808.84 --> 815.71
examples well here it is

813.04 --> 817.7199999999999
tough to find a real world example of it

815.71 --> 819.87
except for the in this case the

817.72 --> 823.48
presupposed world the thing is however

819.87 --> 824.85
it's falsifiable and that's a big

823.48 --> 828.839
difference

824.85 --> 831.259
you know in a sense a dome surrounding

828.839 --> 834.389
the earth realm as we know it is also

831.259 --> 836.85
falsifiable by basically bumping into

834.389 --> 837.99
the dome or not bumping into the dome

836.85 --> 839.5500000000001
right but it's a little bit more

837.99 --> 842.22
difficult because yeah the Flat Earth

839.55 --> 844.8599999999999
discus presupposing it's in Frankie

842.22 --> 845.4300000000001
Antarctica you we're not even allowed to

844.86 --> 850.74
go there

845.43 --> 853.7399999999999
so however a looping realm nature is a

850.74 --> 856.589
little bit easier to falsify because we

853.74 --> 859.05
don't have to go somewhere outside of

856.589 --> 862.98
where we're allowed on the only real

859.05 --> 866.0089999999999
thing we initially need to do to start

862.98 --> 870.0600000000001
false of the falsifying whether the

866.009 --> 873.9590000000001
earth realm is looping or not is by

870.06 --> 878.04
sizing up the orientation of the land

873.959 --> 882.959
masses and sea bottom I would be layout

878.04 --> 887.16
is mainly is the equator which is by the

882.959 --> 891.66
way in an extrapolated virtual line over

887.16 --> 893.639
the realm based on the solar maxim as it

891.66 --> 896.85
were it's like the highest point of the

893.639 --> 900.509
Sun and this well on the presupposed

896.85 --> 907.74
flatter disc would be a literal circle

900.509 --> 908.899
over the space right but yeah if that's

907.74 --> 912.66
not the case

908.899 --> 915.36
what if it's not a literal circle like

912.66 --> 919.38
it could tie in and then you could

915.36 --> 922.139
presuppose it's a circle right maybe but

919.38 --> 927.569
what if when you actually measure it bit

922.139 --> 932.12
by bit and you end up missing a few

927.569 --> 936.689
degrees because a circle is absolutely

932.12 --> 940.23
360 degrees right so what if it's not a

936.689 --> 944.399
circle what if it is a half circle what

940.23 --> 947.04
do you do then you know it's still gonna

944.399 --> 947.939
be flat there's no curvature none

947.04 --> 951.63
whatsoever

947.939 --> 954.149
zero it's all perfectly flat and there's

951.63 --> 957.58
no geometrical horizon that's visible

954.149 --> 959.89
you in other words in existence

957.58 --> 962.62
as if it's not visibly in horizon then

959.89 --> 967.0
it's not a horizon or it's just not

962.62 --> 970.87
there but yeah the orientation of the

967.0 --> 974.41
equator line is critical to falsify

970.87 --> 977.079
whether the earth has a looping nature

974.41 --> 981.0699999999999
within the realm or not or if it is all

977.079 --> 983.56
physical literal spatial wise and it is

981.07 --> 988.589
contained in some physical barrier

983.56 --> 992.8
bastes them.i sphere or something right

988.589 --> 996.8800000000001
but yeah it could be the equator line

992.8 --> 999.6999999999999
could be a what is it a half a circle an

996.88 --> 1002.67
arc as I call it or it could even be a

999.7 --> 1005.279
literal straight line now of course

1002.67 --> 1009.079
ballers will immediately launch

1005.279 --> 1011.76
themselves onto if that were the case

1009.079 --> 1015.51
presupposing they're then going over

1011.76 --> 1017.85
that curve of that equator line right

1015.51 --> 1021.5699999999999
they're gonna absolutely presuppose then

1017.85 --> 1025.559
like ah see we got the proof

1021.57 --> 1026.6100000000001
after all that deira visible because

1025.559 --> 1029.52
they're kind of presuppose there's

1026.61 --> 1031.079
curvature right and that so so that the

1029.52 --> 1033.839
equator line which would be

1031.079 --> 1037.47
geometrically straight would then be

1033.839 --> 1039.72
there our value reaffirmation it's not

1037.47 --> 1043.199
though because there's no curvature it's

1039.72 --> 1047.069
gonna then be a absolutely dead straight

1043.199 --> 1053.429
line looping in on itself line you could

1047.069 --> 1054.87
move on to eternally potentially it's

1053.429 --> 1058.1100000000001
kind of funny when you think about it

1054.87 --> 1058.53
it's like big yeah this is never gonna

1058.11 --> 1061.3799999999999
happen

1058.53 --> 1066.6
it would be silly if it would what yeah

1061.38 --> 1070.44
for example get a super high-tech train

1066.6 --> 1072.7199999999998
tube going perfectly straight over the

1070.44 --> 1076.8300000000002
equator of parallel or whatever you know

1072.72 --> 1079.59
if it's straight now theoretically in

1076.83 --> 1080.85
such a tube if it had for example vacuum

1079.59 --> 1083.9399999999998
system so that there would be

1080.85 --> 1088.1999999999998
effectively zero friction that means it

1083.94 --> 1088.99
could literally speed up forever if it

1088.2 --> 1093.13
was actually

1088.99 --> 1095.34
perfectly straight could go on forever

1093.13 --> 1097.69
speed-up forever because in a

1095.34 --> 1100.6599999999999
centrifugal situation when you're moving

1097.69 --> 1103.3
in a circle faster do you go the more

1100.66 --> 1105.22
force center petal force is going to

1103.3 --> 1107.4099999999999
push you sideways effectively so you can

1105.22 --> 1111.25
do that if you're going in a perfect

1107.41 --> 1114.13
looping straight line then there is no

1111.25 --> 1116.77
extra forces added on as you go faster

1114.13 --> 1118.15
and faster except for any potential

1116.77 --> 1121.24
friction well if you got the vacuum

1118.15 --> 1124.39
situation there then that's going to be

1121.24 --> 1126.48
accounted for so can you imagine this is

1124.39 --> 1130.63
this is a very weird science fiction

1126.48 --> 1135.52
conceptualization but yeah I ponder upon

1130.63 --> 1137.2900000000002
these things but yeah did whether there

1135.52 --> 1139.78
is a looping nature to the realm is

1137.29 --> 1144.79
falsifiable and I'm very proud that I

1139.78 --> 1148.12
figure that out and it's it should be

1144.79 --> 1151.21
more easily falsifiable then like the

1148.12 --> 1156.28
nature of any dome there might be out

1151.21 --> 1160.5
there or a barrier because yeah we can

1156.28 --> 1160.5
actually go and where the equator is

1161.64 --> 1167.8300000000002
anyway I hope that clarified it thank

1165.94 --> 1170.8300000000002
you for bringing it up it's good to

1167.83 --> 1179.74
think about such things instead of just

1170.83 --> 1184.1399999999999
being miserable [ __ ] a really tiny one

1179.74 --> 1187.29
boy I made it up I made up the

1184.14 --> 1190.9
falsifiability of my conception did I

1187.29 --> 1193.8999999999999
really so I just made it up it that's

1190.9 --> 1197.8200000000002
not figuring it out really so are you

1193.9 --> 1200.89
saying that my falsification method is

1197.82 --> 1203.55
invalid is that what you're saying

1200.89 --> 1203.5500000000002
tiny womble

1208.47 --> 1211.559
[Music]

1225.95 --> 1239.06
okay well tiny mumble you're wrong it is

1233.96 --> 1241.4
falsifiable it's I figured that out and

1239.06 --> 1244.55
I'm proud of it you can say I made it up

1241.4 --> 1247.1000000000001
well technically if you are going to go

1244.55 --> 1249.77
by where information is coming from

1247.1 --> 1253.01
right yeah I did I did make it up

1249.77 --> 1254.6299999999999
because nobody else did I'm the only one

1253.01 --> 1256.97
that's actually trying to take this

1254.63 --> 1259.7
serious you know there's people that

1256.97 --> 1265.48
have made the freaking model and I found

1259.7 --> 1268.49
it back right I think I even showed it

1265.48 --> 1271.13
so yeah other people have of course

1268.49 --> 1274.16
dealt with it too I actually tried to

1271.13 --> 1276.5900000000001
figure out how can you falsify some of

1274.16 --> 1278.93
this how can you disprove this to be

1276.59 --> 1282.4599999999998
true because that's kind of an important

1278.93 --> 1285.53
thing in science I know that ballers and

1282.46 --> 1287.21
science believers with the body of

1285.53 --> 1288.74
science don't really like to hear about

1287.21 --> 1292.07
that because it takes away some of their

1288.74 --> 1297.08
freedom falsifiability is extremely

1292.07 --> 1300.5
important yeah and yeah it's very me

1297.08 --> 1303.35
it's like the one little tiny step more

1300.5 --> 1305.72
into philosophy from the scientific

1303.35 --> 1310.01
method way because the scientific method

1305.72 --> 1313.58
has falsifiability per default if you

1310.01 --> 1315.74
can't very manipulate that the phenomena

1313.58 --> 1318.1699999999998
which is the presumed cause of the

1315.74 --> 1320.45
effect you're trying to test if you can

1318.17 --> 1323.9
even change it then it's technically not

1320.45 --> 1328.13
falsifiable so it becomes invalid well I

1323.9 --> 1331.0400000000002
take the spirit of that concept and I

1328.13 --> 1333.89
then overlay it over certain aspects of

1331.04 --> 1337.57
the earth realm and the consequence is

1333.89 --> 1341.17
natural geometry geometry and spatiality

1337.57 --> 1344.99
consequences falls under cosmogony

1341.17 --> 1348.5
that's what I do sorry if you think it's

1344.99 --> 1352.43
all made up but hey at least I'm

1348.5 --> 1356.81
actually trying to figure out in in a

1352.43 --> 1359.309
somewhat scientific way to tackle the

1356.81 --> 1361.769
orientation and the nature of the realm

1359.309 --> 1364.799
instead of for example the entire

1361.769 --> 1366.99
department of geology geology which

1364.799 --> 1368.82
constantly just presupposes a freakin

1366.99 --> 1371.159
ball without any proof their data

1368.82 --> 1374.85
whenever they try to do something with

1371.159 --> 1381.69
it their modeling okay

1374.85 --> 1385.6789999999999
tiny Womble so how did I falsify it I

1381.69 --> 1389.7
didn't say I falsified it I said I know

1385.679 --> 1392.8200000000002
I figured out how it can be falsified

1389.7 --> 1394.919
and that it that it can be falsified in

1392.82 --> 1399.149
the first place with the which is a

1394.919 --> 1402.0900000000001
critical realization about it okay

1399.149 --> 1404.7489999999998
because if it wasn't falsifiable then it

1402.09 --> 1407.97
could be a story that nobody could ever

1404.749 --> 1411.69
disprove and then yeah what do you do it

1407.97 --> 1414.809
becomes just a story is gone safari tale

1411.69 --> 1416.789
I don't like that well I do like fairy

1414.809 --> 1421.4089999999999
tales but I'm much more interested in

1416.789 --> 1424.889
figuring out what the fantastical

1421.409 --> 1427.3200000000002
reality will turn out to be because I'm

1424.889 --> 1430.9989999999998
pretty sure it's rather remarkable so

1427.32 --> 1430.999
far everything I figured out

1439.26 --> 1452.15
[Music]

1442.72 --> 1454.49
hmm yeah baller flat confused okay if

1452.15 --> 1456.3200000000002
you're really so confused and you want

1454.49 --> 1460.18
to learn well maybe you should stop

1456.32 --> 1463.82
complaining you know it's not a good

1460.18 --> 1466.0700000000002
good trait for a student she come in

1463.82 --> 1469.6699999999998
they start complaining about everything

1466.07 --> 1472.07
that's gonna yeah make me just take you

1469.67 --> 1477.8600000000001
so why don't you just sit back and

1472.07 --> 1482.72
listen alright we're not here to

1477.86 --> 1484.61
convince you of anything but if you want

1482.72 --> 1488.08
you could pay attention and learn

1484.61 --> 1488.08
something how about that

1495.32 --> 1498.4399999999998
[Music]

1499.52 --> 1506.0
oh right Eyes Wide Shut let me guess

1502.39 --> 1508.0700000000002
yeah he tells me why don't you stretch

1506.0 --> 1509.9
it why do you keep it tight like that

1508.07 --> 1516.29
it's gonna damage the BA blah blah yeah

1509.9 --> 1520.0590000000002
I know I know it's a prop oh it's a real

1516.29 --> 1520.059
bow but I'm using it as a problem

1528.79 --> 1534.3799999999999
that ended at this point if I would like

1533.21 --> 1536.1200000000001
where I'm living

1534.38 --> 1539.15
there's no way I'm gonna do anything

1536.12 --> 1540.9499999999998
with it ever but hey if my situation

1539.15 --> 1544.2800000000002
would change you who knows I get a house

1540.95 --> 1545.9
a garden well then I might consider hey

1544.28 --> 1549.95
maybe I actually want to learn how to

1545.9 --> 1553.01
shoot a bow but very likely I buy a new

1549.95 --> 1555.47
bow for that and then train it from a

1553.01 --> 1563.559
start because I've had this thing for a

1555.47 --> 1563.559
very long time and yeah it gets old

1566.989 --> 1574.909
right no thanks eyes wide shut

1570.21 --> 1583.049
it is a real bow it's a composite bow

1574.909 --> 1587.519
the old style I got it from a

1583.049 --> 1593.34
Renaissance Faire from a guy from

1587.519 --> 1596.84
Hungary that made him with the real

1593.34 --> 1596.84
leather and all it's pretty impressive

1599.299 --> 1606.029
for like I think he actually made the

1601.979 --> 1610.489
letter himself as well cuz he also had

1606.029 --> 1610.489
there were lots of skins around the ship

1625.97 --> 1629.98
Wow surprise surprise

1632.03 --> 1641.1399999999999
so yeah you did exactly what I asked you

1635.69 --> 1646.3
not to do baller flat confused maybe

1641.14 --> 1646.3000000000002
just get the [ __ ] out of here

1652.81 --> 1655.839
[Music]

1663.71 --> 1669.06
Yeah right I'm not a hundred percent

1667.02 --> 1672.18
sure if he had his own tannery though

1669.06 --> 1675.09
and it could be like they were partners

1672.18 --> 1676.65
or neighbors or something it could have

1675.09 --> 1678.78
been like a single village where they

1676.65 --> 1682.5900000000001
just had that production line thing

1678.78 --> 1684.36
going all the time I don't know but yeah

1682.59 --> 1686.76
there were multiple people from Hungary

1684.36 --> 1691.77
there and they seemed to know each other

1686.76 --> 1695.24
and their world yeah there were like cow

1691.77 --> 1699.9
skins and rabbit skins and just leather

1695.24 --> 1701.94
all of it oh yeah by the way dank I

1699.9 --> 1704.0700000000002
almost forgot you said you sent

1701.94 --> 1706.46
something over the paper let me check

1704.07 --> 1706.46
that out

1720.84 --> 1729.58
Flattr theta no no you can't prove the

1726.34 --> 1733.53
geometry of Earth through science it's

1729.58 --> 1737.46
impossible but you can definitely

1733.53 --> 1741.22
disprove it's a ball by the necessary

1737.46 --> 1742.45
antecedent effects and geometrical curve

1741.22 --> 1747.549
they would have to be there and all that

1742.45 --> 1749.6200000000001
missing but yeah you can conclude that

1747.549 --> 1751.78
the earth is flat due to the absolute

1749.62 --> 1754.6
missing of curvature that's not too

1751.78 --> 1757.6
difficult oh yeah by the way thank you

1754.6 --> 1760.09
thank Jack tip 30 euros super chair

1757.6 --> 1765.6899999999998
donation for the paypal thank you very

1760.09 --> 1765.6899999999998
much good to have your support

1783.94 --> 1788.0700000000002
yep that's right resto

1790.02 --> 1795.75
yeah that's right Flattr data that's

1792.929 --> 1801.9
impossible we've been saying that for

1795.75 --> 1805.71
years now I don't know you I've seen you

1801.9 --> 1809.3090000000002
I remember correctly even in the in the

1805.71 --> 1811.5
panel on Fe D or ballbuster sure

1809.309 --> 1816.59
whenever it was so you should just know

1811.5 --> 1816.59
this or do you think it's like

1816.679 --> 1825.99
humiliating - for us to basically admit

1820.94 --> 1830.19
the the truth that you can't prove the

1825.99 --> 1833.27
shape of the earth through science that

1830.19 --> 1837.8300000000002
it's not within the range of possibility

1833.27 --> 1837.83
to use the scientific method to do that

1838.28 --> 1844.3999999999999
because it's not humiliating at all it's

1841.14 --> 1844.4
just called getting real

1854.61 --> 1859.03
[Music]

1856.03 --> 1859.03
dude

1860.52 --> 1864.35
Missouri bear why are you calling

1876.26 --> 1884.72
mmm I said I don't think I've seen the

1881.25 --> 1888.57
video but I can him yeah with

1884.72 --> 1894.289
electrostatics you know a piece of cloth

1888.57 --> 1894.289
especially sure that should be possible

1898.05 --> 1907.76
oh well I'm so sorry for you acaba so

1903.3 --> 1911.49
sorry that Nathan Oakley is a is a mean

1907.76 --> 1916.05
merciless old doc that refuses to let

1911.49 --> 1919.38
you presuppose things I'm sorry sorry it

1916.05 --> 1921.9199999999998
hurts if it really hurts that much maybe

1919.38 --> 1921.92
you shouldn't watch

1935.55 --> 1940.44
oh no no no random explorer oh yeah we

1938.46 --> 1942.78
can definitely determine the shape of

1940.44 --> 1949.98
the things we live on but you can't use

1942.78 --> 1955.94
it you can do it using science you can

1949.98 --> 1959.88
use it using a combination of optics

1955.94 --> 1962.94
geometry and careful psychology as to

1959.88 --> 1965.67
not get involved in presupposing

1962.94 --> 1967.97
nonsense right because that's a big

1965.67 --> 1970.71
problem for a whole category of people

1967.97 --> 1976.14
but yeah that you can't use the

1970.71 --> 1980.52
scientific method on it but you can

1976.14 --> 1985.5800000000002
definitely determine aspects just using

1980.52 --> 1987.65
knowledge and insights then optics

1985.58 --> 1990.0
things that have been established

1987.65 --> 1993.21
through science through the scientific

1990.0 --> 1995.78
method you could definitely use those to

1993.21 --> 1995.78
figure it out

2002.11 --> 2007.75
[Music]

2012.39 --> 2024.0700000000002
Nathan stays barbecue in y'all yeah yeah

2017.11 --> 2026.1399999999999
he likes to put up the flames hot you

2024.07 --> 2028.36
know I'm I'm kind of more a slow cooking

2026.14 --> 2032.8500000000001
guy dad like I don't like my fires very

2028.36 --> 2035.83
hot I like just them to take their time

2032.85 --> 2039.01
it's easier on my digestion but nathan

2035.83 --> 2041.9399999999998
is just like a singe guy he's just you

2039.01 --> 2044.89
know puts the pan he puts the oil in and

2041.94 --> 2046.81
until it's like almost goes to flame and

2044.89 --> 2047.38
then throws all that [ __ ] in and starts

2046.81 --> 2049.57
stirring

2047.38 --> 2051.7000000000003
I don't know if he's literally a cook

2049.57 --> 2056.409
like that but that's how he handles the

2051.7 --> 2059.3799999999997
ballers but I'm much more of a slow

2056.409 --> 2062.139
cooker you you guys must agree like I

2059.38 --> 2066.46
never just hammer on a baller just like

2062.139 --> 2071.05
that you know I always give them some

2066.46 --> 2073.36
room to at least just say whatever they

2071.05 --> 2076.53
have to say for a moment and then yeah I

2073.36 --> 2076.53
might get sick of it but

2083.22 --> 2091.74
I know Rasta I know I paid attention you

2087.42 --> 2095.9700000000003
know I actually tried it but yeah it got

2091.74 --> 2098.58
as messy as I expected so and my fires

2095.97 --> 2102.0
don't get hot enough like even with the

2098.58 --> 2104.24
higher but the biggest one it's just not

2102.0 --> 2104.24
working

2108.17 --> 2113.61
I'm essential to Fe D that never let

2111.81 --> 2117.42
anyone tell you different

2113.61 --> 2121.35
well thank you dank I I did I do before

2117.42 --> 2124.41
I do get the feeling well that I do I

2121.35 --> 2126.8399999999997
feel appreciated more so than I did for

2124.41 --> 2129.42
example two years ago nathan has been

2126.84 --> 2131.94
very gracious you know I get on his

2129.42 --> 2134.16
nerves sometimes too and he slaps me

2131.94 --> 2138.06
like he does with everyone when they get

2134.16 --> 2143.04
on his nerves but yeah he's he's been

2138.06 --> 2146.13
very gracious and I think even like sort

2143.04 --> 2148.62
of thinker tailors his approach due to

2146.13 --> 2151.35
his own insight on me as a character and

2148.62 --> 2153.72
my sensitivities so I feel very

2151.35 --> 2156.87
appreciated by Nathan despite any bad

2153.72 --> 2159.8399999999997
moments we've had in the past hope they

2156.87 --> 2161.73
will stick to a minimum but yeah you can

2159.84 --> 2164.6400000000003
never really predict it and the other

2161.73 --> 2166.89
guys too you know but it's also it's

2164.64 --> 2168.93
been a exploratory art you know being

2166.89 --> 2171.0
appreciated you don't just get it by

2168.93 --> 2173.8799999999997
hanging around you you get it by doing

2171.0 --> 2181.47
things right by getting the chemistry

2173.88 --> 2183.6600000000003
going and yes yeah I know I I get very

2181.47 --> 2186.12
inspired sometimes and for example

2183.66 --> 2187.5299999999997
finding new creative ways to respond to

2186.12 --> 2189.27
the housekeeping questions and it

2187.53 --> 2192.3300000000004
happens every now and then like every

2189.27 --> 2194.79
week I figure out something new you know

2192.33 --> 2196.71
to respond with it in some way whether

2194.79 --> 2198.63
it's a joke or relating to some

2196.71 --> 2202.76
situation in the world or what the

2198.63 --> 2202.76
baller said I can always find something

2206.96 --> 2210.56
all right so

2211.83 --> 2218.42
I think though you know every kid

2214.95 --> 2223.95
probably still run on without me but

2218.42 --> 2226.05
yeah there would be less silence Legolas

2223.95 --> 2234.8399999999997
moments you know and it would be

2226.05 --> 2239.6400000000003
different because I am always that guy

2234.84 --> 2242.76
that does that actually like what you're

2239.64 --> 2244.95
now using as a weapon to smite them with

2242.76 --> 2246.8100000000004
actually it's slightly different we're

2244.95 --> 2249.3599999999997
still in the wind but it's slightly

2246.81 --> 2251.4
different that's I've been doing that

2249.36 --> 2258.1800000000003
since the start and can't help it this

2251.4 --> 2260.57
is I always do that [ __ ] I think it was

2258.18 --> 2262.41
a great Bob rant really misery bear I

2260.57 --> 2264.7400000000002
thought it was kind of depressing

2262.41 --> 2264.74
actually

2265.49 --> 2273.75
yeah but yeah we had it moment it's just

2269.85 --> 2277.68
it was very similar to the last time in

2273.75 --> 2280.95
the what's it again over an iron row

2277.68 --> 2281.52
media chat but now this time we both had

2280.95 --> 2285.0
a wrench

2281.52 --> 2289.56
so he was kind of didn't really know

2285.0 --> 2292.92
what to do because yeah I was just

2289.56 --> 2297.36
saying basically saying it raster cell

2292.92 --> 2299.52
like very like really slapping him in

2297.36 --> 2302.7000000000003
the face with it because I was just in a

2299.52 --> 2307.8
bad mood and I just wasn't in for his

2302.7 --> 2312.24
babying [ __ ] you know but he still hung

2307.8 --> 2314.1000000000004
around it was funny because I noted

2312.24 --> 2315.72
because I was basically ranting on like

2314.1 --> 2316.98
that and he kept silent for one so I

2315.72 --> 2321.1499999999996
thought okay he's gone away that's

2316.98 --> 2323.76
probably smart until another troll that

2321.15 --> 2326.9100000000003
just happened to pop up made a joke

2323.76 --> 2330.84
about me didn't do anything about that

2326.91 --> 2333.21
because they'll care but then Bob said

2330.84 --> 2337.3500000000004
another thing like haha yeah to the

2333.21 --> 2341.76
choice so yeah then you know what's

2337.35 --> 2344.19
going on it was just so typical you know

2341.76 --> 2344.76
I don't seek him out to do anything like

2344.19 --> 2348.15
that it's

2344.76 --> 2351.5400000000004
just that you know I'm a very serious

2348.15 --> 2354.2400000000002
debater I take my science and my

2351.54 --> 2356.37
conceptions and the academics very

2354.24 --> 2359.3999999999996
seriously even though I am sometimes

2356.37 --> 2363.8399999999997
kind of lazy like yeah I should know

2359.4 --> 2365.79
things more it's just things sometimes

2363.84 --> 2369.7200000000003
take a longer time to get in but when

2365.79 --> 2373.47
they're in it's perfect it can take a

2369.72 --> 2376.41
while and yeah then when Bob just blurts

2373.47 --> 2380.52
out all this nonsense and even it has

2376.41 --> 2383.0099999999998
the audacity to again in my presence

2380.52 --> 2388.68
bring up that he has all this science

2383.01 --> 2391.19
for gravity and the dome it's just he

2388.68 --> 2394.5
should know better than that

2391.19 --> 2398.4
but he's a freaking baby he can help

2394.5 --> 2401.07
himself if there's not everybody around

2398.4 --> 2403.7400000000002
to immediately silence a person like me

2401.07 --> 2405.7200000000003
like remove my text so that he doesn't

2403.74 --> 2409.0499999999997
respond to it because he just can't help

2405.72 --> 2412.3799999999997
himself he can't get over the fact he's

2409.05 --> 2415.0800000000004
freaking wrong no he'll need hundreds of

2412.38 --> 2417.63
people around him just to make him

2415.08 --> 2420.0299999999997
forget about it so he'll stop whining

2417.63 --> 2424.02
about it that's the reality

2420.03 --> 2432.42
ah I already did it anyway he deserved

2424.02 --> 2434.73
it it's just annoying if you want to

2432.42 --> 2438.6
pretend like you're a freaking flat

2434.73 --> 2442.56
earth scientist then you gotta stick it

2438.6 --> 2444.63
to your safe space rooms because we

2442.56 --> 2449.0299999999997
ain't tolerating that pseudoscience

2444.63 --> 2449.03
[ __ ] simple as that

2452.35 --> 2457.73
and I wish him the best of luck with his

2455.21 --> 2459.94
research on electrostatics and

2457.73 --> 2462.56
dielectrics and how that's supposed to

2459.94 --> 2464.6
explain gravity that's all really nice

2462.56 --> 2468.2
so yeah I wish him the best of luck

2464.6 --> 2469.7
actually testing it out which is an

2468.2 --> 2472.3999999999996
admirable thing to do you know to

2469.7 --> 2475.43
technological development sure dude Bob

2472.4 --> 2478.25
go ahead you're an engineer that's what

2475.43 --> 2482.3599999999997
engineers do i bless you for it but

2478.25 --> 2485.21
please don't start calling that [ __ ]

2482.36 --> 2488.81
science and your model science because

2485.21 --> 2491.48
it's not your just playing into the

2488.81 --> 2493.67
mainstream dumb off' occation narrative

2491.48 --> 2497.08
of science and you should do that you

2493.67 --> 2497.08
should know better than that

2500.59 --> 2504.6400000000003
anyways it's enough about that

2520.0 --> 2527.14
all right the random Explorer that's

2521.8 --> 2529.27
fine yeah you're okay guy and a

2527.14 --> 2531.58
everybody can be like that you know it's

2529.27 --> 2534.91
just that if you can't help yourself you

2531.58 --> 2537.16
got it you got a poke it in the wrong

2534.91 --> 2539.62
moment you feel it when that's the case

2537.16 --> 2542.71
cuz I'm very clear about that

2539.62 --> 2546.31
I give up signs very clearly then it's

2542.71 --> 2547.9
up to you but if you can hold it if you

2546.31 --> 2551.68
can hold it up if you can control

2547.9 --> 2554.76
yourself well then yeah you're always

2551.68 --> 2554.7599999999998
welcome in my chat

2569.32 --> 2574.25
Figur should use that money much much

2571.91 --> 2577.43
more wisely well that's gonna be very

2574.25 --> 2581.95
tough Missouri bear because Fe core is

2577.43 --> 2584.99
basically a like a a private group and

2581.95 --> 2587.75
now I am not too well informed about

2584.99 --> 2591.83
this so I'll try to keep out of it don't

2587.75 --> 2596.39
mean anything bad to you Fe core guys at

2591.83 --> 2599.27
all I admire what you've done so far but

2596.39 --> 2601.91
yeah I think that there's just a lot of

2599.27 --> 2603.59
like personal investments including by

2601.91 --> 2608.5099999999998
Bob so yeah what are you gonna do about

2603.59 --> 2613.52
it you know that's what happens so he's

2608.51 --> 2615.92
yeah he's got a foot in the bath and

2613.52 --> 2618.02
he's not taking it out probably that's

2615.92 --> 2620.69
yeah I don't know if that makes any

2618.02 --> 2623.54
sense that metaphor but yeah he's just

2620.69 --> 2625.94
not he's not getting out and I don't

2623.54 --> 2627.17
know if anybody even wants him out and I

2625.94 --> 2633.08
don't know what kind of relationship

2627.17 --> 2635.9
they have man because I think that if

2633.08 --> 2638.81
you somehow can manage did not step on

2635.9 --> 2641.12
Bob's toes by completely avoiding that

2638.81 --> 2644.81
entire territory and leaving it to him

2641.12 --> 2646.46
as an expert that is probably a fine guy

2644.81 --> 2650.57
to go around with you know it's probably

2646.46 --> 2653.87
just fine but yeah I'm not that person

2650.57 --> 2659.84
because I'll definitely go there as to

2653.87 --> 2661.43
what I do so yeah it's just Bob and I

2659.84 --> 2662.83
are just never going to be natural

2661.43 --> 2668.3599999999997
friends it's never gonna happen

2662.83 --> 2672.11
you know we may be like you like I don't

2668.36 --> 2675.26
know I think you could probably would

2672.11 --> 2679.2200000000003
just respect one another or learn enough

2675.26 --> 2683.2700000000004
to just not open our pie holes right Bob

2679.22 --> 2685.22
and then I think that yeah you'll find

2683.27 --> 2687.59
that if you don't overstep those type of

2685.22 --> 2691.4599999999996
things I'll actually be extremely

2687.59 --> 2697.82
generous to you as a person I usually

2691.46 --> 2700.14
a.m. but yeah it's gonna take some and

2697.82 --> 2704.049
maybe some time to

2700.14 --> 2707.709
right well thank but that's the whole

2704.049 --> 2710.109
thing you know Bob is open to and use a

2707.709 --> 2714.94
speculation yes so am I

2710.109 --> 2721.049
I'm just very clear about it and I don't

2714.94 --> 2724.15
go swimming in these these systems of

2721.049 --> 2726.759
presupposition like that I don't know

2724.15 --> 2728.319
it's it's not really my tip well in a

2726.759 --> 2730.229
way you know I've done that sort of

2728.319 --> 2732.849
thing with my Dungeons & Dragons book

2730.229 --> 2734.89
because that basically it is very

2732.849 --> 2737.38
similar it's just an entire model of

2734.89 --> 2744.1299999999997
this presupposed reality this sub

2737.38 --> 2749.559
reality you're working with but yeah

2744.13 --> 2751.779
with gravity you know like I wanted to

2749.559 --> 2755.1090000000004
do that originally with gravity but it's

2751.779 --> 2758.069
just not useful because gravity is just

2755.109 --> 2760.989
not what I thought it was originally and

2758.069 --> 2763.329
I really I'm sticking to the aberration

2760.989 --> 2765.989
because it is so aberrant it is so

2763.329 --> 2770.559
convincing it there's so many things

2765.989 --> 2773.109
it's not scientific not manipulating the

2770.559 --> 2775.509
actual phenomena that is supposedly

2773.109 --> 2778.15
causing the effect the displacement

2775.509 --> 2781.2690000000002
naturally not doing some other

2778.15 --> 2783.699
displacement on top or countering it but

2781.269 --> 2786.279
the actual displacement supposedly

2783.699 --> 2790.14
caused by gravity right even if you

2786.279 --> 2795.069
assume that it would be like that then

2790.14 --> 2797.769
you can't ferry it you can't change the

2795.069 --> 2800.17
gravity itself so yeah it's gonna fit on

2797.769 --> 2802.41
top of there it's like the the easiest

2800.17 --> 2808.359
thing in the world the breeze suppose

2802.41 --> 2810.969
that there's a force like a force

2808.359 --> 2813.759
disequilibrium happening at all times

2810.969 --> 2816.549
comes a constant that's just it's there

2813.759 --> 2819.059
there is a force and if you presuppose

2816.549 --> 2822.609
that yeah hey the things kind of will

2819.059 --> 2824.6800000000003
work out and we'll kind of form that but

2822.609 --> 2828.069
the gradient to you know if you have a

2824.68 --> 2831.6699999999996
model that that will what is it simulate

2828.069 --> 2832.6
that sure it'll work and that's why it's

2831.67 --> 2835.69
so [ __ ]

2832.6 --> 2839.65
because the aberration is so pure it's

2835.69 --> 2843.88
so so strong up to the point that you

2839.65 --> 2846.88
can even simulate apparent zero-g by

2843.88 --> 2851.02
moving along and then suddenly the

2846.88 --> 2854.44
relative density is neutralized the it's

2851.02 --> 2856.33
a craziest thing ever it's not actually

2854.44 --> 2858.9700000000003
neutralized because it is in motion but

2856.33 --> 2862.68
it seems to be neutralized like that it

2858.97 --> 2865.12
is and that makes gravity like a

2862.68 --> 2866.8599999999997
foremost aberration it's not just a

2865.12 --> 2870.31
leered weird little thing you know it's

2866.86 --> 2874.42
a giant ghost and you can't get around

2870.31 --> 2876.43
it you could go through it but it's just

2874.42 --> 2880.75
so convincing there's so much you can do

2876.43 --> 2885.6099999999997
with it it's just it's very tough on the

2880.75 --> 2890.47
mind and thus most people just take it

2885.61 --> 2893.35
for real and they take it for real not

2890.47 --> 2897.52
just because a book says it but because

2893.35 --> 2900.49
of their practical use of it when you

2897.52 --> 2903.0099999999998
practically use a model and it keeps

2900.49 --> 2905.5
working out so easy every time yeah

2903.01 --> 2912.03
you're gonna think it's real it's as

2905.5 --> 2915.91
simple as that but yeah it isn't real it

2912.03 --> 2920.6800000000003
just seems like it's real and it works

2915.91 --> 2924.04
out it's just not that model the model

2920.68 --> 2927.94
itself the explanation given that's not

2924.04 --> 2931.39
proven it's just a trick you apply to a

2927.94 --> 2933.4
simulation and then it pans out really

2931.39 --> 2936.5499999999997
well that's what it is that's what

2933.4 --> 2940.48
gravity is it's all it is it's not

2936.55 --> 2943.2400000000002
proven because it's not understood what

2940.48 --> 2946.54
the actual cause of this is what

2943.24 --> 2950.4599999999996
basically the cause for relative density

2946.54 --> 2954.16
is why why does it split up like that

2950.46 --> 2956.11
bar a presupposition of a force

2954.16 --> 2958.75
disequilibrium field causing that

2956.11 --> 2959.9500000000003
deficient through density differential

2958.75 --> 2962.86
right

2959.95 --> 2966.1
other than that presupposition that it

2962.86 --> 2969.46
must be that what is actually causing it

2966.1 --> 2970.93
well we can't find out because we can't

2969.46 --> 2972.9700000000003
alter it maybe that's for the best

2970.93 --> 2975.7599999999998
because we don't want the entire world

2972.97 --> 2982.6299999999997
to just at least like turn it inside out

2975.76 --> 2990.61
like that you know but yeah that's

2982.63 --> 2993.52
that's gravity the cause is the mass

2990.61 --> 2997.15
itself now but that's that the technical

2993.52 --> 3001.11
cause for the displacement it's the

2997.15 --> 3004.07
density right sleeping warrior but my

3001.11 --> 3007.35
question is what is the cause for

3004.07 --> 3013.17
relative density displacement why does

3007.35 --> 3015.0899999999997
it do that why right that the ball a

3013.17 --> 3017.2200000000003
good answer would be gravity yeah and if

3015.09 --> 3019.77
you presuppose a model where that forced

3017.22 --> 3022.95
this equilibria feel this present yeah

3019.77 --> 3025.71
it pans out but it's not proof though

3022.95 --> 3028.1699999999996
and that's the problem it's not about

3025.71 --> 3030.0
how does relative density work how does

3028.17 --> 3031.59
the displacement work no that's very

3030.0 --> 3034.83
clearly established it's called relative

3031.59 --> 3038.1000000000004
density or density it's through the

3034.83 --> 3040.86
relative density disequilibrium that

3038.1 --> 3045.36
that manifests a force and then causes

3040.86 --> 3049.4100000000003
the displacement or pressure right but

3045.36 --> 3050.28
what causes the matter in the realm to

3049.41 --> 3052.62
work like that

3050.28 --> 3054.36
why the relative density well that we

3052.62 --> 3056.04
have no answer and we have no concern

3054.36 --> 3059.7000000000003
for that because we're just gonna stick

3056.04 --> 3060.96
to the scientific proof you know but

3059.7 --> 3063.8999999999996
yeah there's going to be a lot of people

3060.96 --> 3065.79
they're gonna be like it.why way it's

3063.9 --> 3070.32
like every six-year-olds question why

3065.79 --> 3072.72
why well just gravity stop bothering me

3070.32 --> 3078.54
we don't know just gravity you know

3072.72 --> 3081.2599999999998
that's that's what's happening it's the

3078.54 --> 3083.97
ghost is too complicated to just bypass

3081.26 --> 3086.55
just like that so most people just stick

3083.97 --> 3090.2
to it they just go with the ghost it

3086.55 --> 3090.2000000000003
goes to gravity the aberration

3105.43 --> 3108.18
hmm

3110.03 --> 3121.46
sound wave oscillation costs pressure

3113.99 --> 3123.83
gradient you have no proof for that all

3121.46 --> 3127.85
gradients well it can cause pressure

3123.83 --> 3129.7999999999997
gradients within a set up that's correct

3127.85 --> 3132.02
but that's not proof that that is

3129.8 --> 3133.67
actually the situation that is causing

3132.02 --> 3137.72
the pressure gradient within the round

3133.67 --> 3139.4
though but it is an interesting little

3137.72 --> 3142.12
factor to bring that up thank you for

3139.4 --> 3142.12
that

3152.97 --> 3156.56
okay and there's ace

3168.19 --> 3173.9500000000003
hmm it's gonna be a good show ah ma you

3172.03 --> 3177.69
okay oh you're having a show on ma UK

3173.95 --> 3177.6899999999996
this evening interesting

3191.77 --> 3197.92
yes tiny mumble that is true but it's

3195.88 --> 3200.02
not the only factor though you know it's

3197.92 --> 3203.35
not just about that you've been lied to

3200.02 --> 3207.46
and that what you're you've been taught

3203.35 --> 3210.19
for pre-constructed lies that you that

3207.46 --> 3214.09
fooled you it's also that after you

3210.19 --> 3216.7200000000003
figure that out that well some people

3214.09 --> 3223.71
may in Clyde to double down anyway

3216.72 --> 3223.7099999999996
that's the problem to go with it anyway

3230.42 --> 3234.9500000000003
and that's typically the type of people

3232.73 --> 3248.589
that do that that we get the face at the

3234.95 --> 3248.589
Flat Earth debates where's Amanda young

3251.33 --> 3259.72
she was here earlier right I've been

3256.19 --> 3259.7200000000003
heard for from her in a while

3289.24 --> 3302.1699999999996
methods remember Flat Earth data from

3294.4 --> 3305.59
darth's video that was amazing this from

3302.17 --> 3308.7400000000002
his first video when the Nathan

3305.59 --> 3311.92
replacement character corrects the guy

3308.74 --> 3324.6699999999996
about the scientific methods if that was

3311.92 --> 3326.89
beautiful can relative density

3324.67 --> 3328.89
disequilibrium be shown in scientific

3326.89 --> 3334.3599999999997
method hell yeah

3328.89 --> 3336.8799999999997
yes it can absolutely it's relative

3334.36 --> 3340.1800000000003
density disequilibrium is part of the

3336.88 --> 3341.8900000000003
relative density Theory proven

3340.18 --> 3347.43
scientifically provable theory and

3341.89 --> 3347.43
repeatable so yes it is a part of it

3367.56 --> 3379.22
yeah come on Missouri bear thank yura

3380.3 --> 3392.63
there now not entirely correct lost

3387.96 --> 3396.66
control and out of money it's it's

3392.63 --> 3399.21
effectively not true the people that are

3396.66 --> 3403.3799999999997
wielding the system that is going out of

3399.21 --> 3407.88
control they have plenty of money they

3403.38 --> 3411.0
are just not willing to use it to

3407.88 --> 3413.88
stabilize the system they want it for

3411.0 --> 3417.51
themselves they're basically just trying

3413.88 --> 3420.3
to find yea more opportunities to reap

3417.51 --> 3423.3
as much money out of it before it all

3420.3 --> 3425.01
tumbles down so they can lock it up in

3423.3 --> 3428.52
their vaults while the entire world

3425.01 --> 3430.7700000000004
burns and then when stops burning try to

3428.52 --> 3435.5099999999998
rebuild on the ashes that's the general

3430.77 --> 3437.94
strategy I think all right but no

3435.51 --> 3442.65
they're not out of money it's absolutely

3437.94 --> 3445.05
preposterous it's just that it's just

3442.65 --> 3447.0
not being given because the people that

3445.05 --> 3449.52
have all the money are just determining

3447.0 --> 3452.36
no that's not how it's gonna go for

3449.52 --> 3454.32
whatever blah blah blah blah reason

3452.36 --> 3457.73
doesn't really matter it's just saying

3454.32 --> 3457.73
no it's as simple as that

3460.21 --> 3463.34
[Music]

3465.37 --> 3474.5299999999997
Fiat is over ha that's a good one

3470.03 --> 3479.4500000000003
Missouri Bear remember that story when

3474.53 --> 3482.21
was it about the American that was like

3479.45 --> 3485.39
stuck on the Japanese island that was

3482.21 --> 3487.28
found in the 60s right and then when he

3485.39 --> 3488.9
was found he almost killed a bunch of

3487.28 --> 3490.6400000000003
people because he still thought the war

3488.9 --> 3496.07
was still going right that's a real

3490.64 --> 3498.31
thing I think I would know 67 easy I

3496.07 --> 3501.29
don't know something like that right so

3498.31 --> 3504.08
yeah I can guarantee you that in 20

3501.29 --> 3506.09
years don't know what what's going on

3504.08 --> 3509.09
with America then and I'm pretty sure

3506.09 --> 3512.84
that in 20 years dollars are probably

3509.09 --> 3518.33
still gonna be used just as this method

3512.84 --> 3521.3500000000004
of exchange and I don't know I think

3518.33 --> 3525.0499999999997
might not even really be worth a lot

3521.35 --> 3527.93
still using usable because it's so much

3525.05 --> 3535.4300000000003
of it and it's everywhere everywhere

3527.93 --> 3538.4199999999996
around the world you know so I don't

3535.43 --> 3540.62
know I don't know about this field

3538.42 --> 3542.42
situation you know I don't even think

3540.62 --> 3546.1099999999997
you can compare it to for example the

3542.42 --> 3551.54
bank in Zimbabwe which like did yeah

3546.11 --> 3555.32
like crazily inflated but it's because

3551.54 --> 3556.91
it didn't really have any power the Bank

3555.32 --> 3561.05
of Zimbabwe they didn't really have

3556.91 --> 3565.06
anything to back it up with the entire

3561.05 --> 3567.38
backing for the dollar has been the

3565.06 --> 3569.39
infrastructural control business

3567.38 --> 3571.19
connection blah blah blah the whole

3569.39 --> 3575.99
thing of what America has kind of been

3571.19 --> 3579.98
doing so that's really the backing for

3575.99 --> 3582.5299999999997
the dollar not any kind of value you

3579.98 --> 3584.21
know so and from that perspective I

3582.53 --> 3586.67
think that even if the dollar is just

3584.21 --> 3589.7
gonna get even crazier and more

3586.67 --> 3594.38
/ overprinted it's still gonna be used

3589.7 --> 3600.02
by in other regions because it's yeah

3594.38 --> 3602.9900000000002
why not I don't know maybe maybe is this

3600.02 --> 3605.36
is just I'm just being silly here maybe

3602.99 --> 3608.24
that doesn't work anymore at the digital

3605.36 --> 3609.92
age but if something like this would

3608.24 --> 3612.2
have had if similar scenario would have

3609.92 --> 3613.94
happened you know yeah I think it

3612.2 --> 3616.58
probably can't work like this what I'm

3613.94 --> 3619.2200000000003
imagining this is still based on a pre

3616.58 --> 3621.47
twentieth century idea before digital

3619.22 --> 3624.62
communications because then and I think

3621.47 --> 3627.98
this even did happen like a kingdom

3624.62 --> 3629.5699999999997
could have banking situations going on

3627.98 --> 3631.13
you know and they would have paper

3629.57 --> 3634.25
representation and they might have

3631.13 --> 3636.2000000000003
colonies and all that and then things

3634.25 --> 3638.09
could go crazy at the homeland and it

3636.2 --> 3641.21
could even be like rites and [ __ ] or a

3638.09 --> 3645.1400000000003
civil war and then like the money is

3641.21 --> 3648.23
worth nothing but yeah in those colonies

3645.14 --> 3649.67
out there they might not even figure it

3648.23 --> 3652.04
out soon enough and they're just gonna

3649.67 --> 3654.59
keep on using it probably the

3652.04 --> 3656.27
controller's there would even not even

3654.59 --> 3658.9100000000003
tell the public there was no just keep

3656.27 --> 3662.54
using it cuz yeah but they're gonna

3658.91 --> 3664.0099999999998
replace the money you know so from that

3662.54 --> 3665.75
perspective I was just thinking like

3664.01 --> 3669.9500000000003
yeah eventually it wouldn't even matter

3665.75 --> 3672.47
how much a bank would screw up because

3669.95 --> 3675.23
if it's just gonna be widespread enough

3672.47 --> 3676.8799999999997
used then that use is going to be the

3675.23 --> 3679.2400000000002
function and not really the original

3676.88 --> 3679.2400000000002
value

3683.9 --> 3692.42
get out of your tion straw bedding idiot

3689.92 --> 3696.38
this is not a place for you to copy

3692.42 --> 3701.049
paste your strom and idiocy nobody's

3696.38 --> 3701.049
claiming a dome doemi

3706.57 --> 3712.9900000000002
then your little system for ultimate

3708.86 --> 3712.9900000000002
control yeah Jack it up

3723.54 --> 3729.2599999999998
digital-only all right it's never gonna

3726.96 --> 3729.26
work

3730.76 --> 3737.51
seriously digital-only is just a

3734.25 --> 3737.51
disaster waiting to happen

3737.78 --> 3744.03
don't know if you know what like

3739.89 --> 3746.31
electronics and [ __ ] can go down so what

3744.03 --> 3749.2200000000003
do you do then what do you do is when

3746.31 --> 3753.69
like literally the power of a city is

3749.22 --> 3756.5699999999997
just like out and nobody has any cash

3753.69 --> 3759.27
cuz you're not allowed to use it what

3756.57 --> 3761.6400000000003
yeah that means that potentially in a

3759.27 --> 3765.109
few hours there could be riots and

3761.64 --> 3769.7599999999998
everything's gonna start burning okay

3765.109 --> 3779.34
so terrible idea

3769.76 --> 3782.7900000000004
terrible now people are gonna use non

3779.34 --> 3784.4100000000003
digital money among their among

3782.79 --> 3788.0099999999998
themselves and they should they should

3784.41 --> 3790.5899999999997
have their own trade literally like a

3788.01 --> 3793.92
digital tree that's really nice well get

3790.59 --> 3796.79
some silver coins next to that get some

3793.92 --> 3803.31
chickens eggs will be great bartering

3796.79 --> 3807.7799999999997
stuffs and you know all that just do

3803.31 --> 3813.81
favors it's like like oh man I really

3807.78 --> 3815.4900000000002
need ya I really need a like a whole lot

3813.81 --> 3819.45
of wood you know you're you're like a

3815.49 --> 3821.64
lumber right okay well I am really good

3819.45 --> 3824.43
at repairing cars you know so maybe if I

3821.64 --> 3827.3399999999997
just freakin repair like your oldest

3824.43 --> 3829.44
truck that you kind of abandon and then

3827.34 --> 3832.6800000000003
fix that up for you and then you just

3829.44 --> 3836.85
fill up a car with wood or for some

3832.68 --> 3838.83
period done no digital [ __ ] no

3836.85 --> 3841.74
doesn't even have to be any freaking

3838.83 --> 3845.8199999999997
registration no you just you just make a

3841.74 --> 3850.08
deal and it's absolutely legal there's

3845.82 --> 3853.59
never going to be not legal because yeah

3850.08 --> 3856.47
it's called trade when currency is not

3853.59 --> 3860.3900000000003
involved neither is the federal

3856.47 --> 3865.95
government they cannot get involved

3860.39 --> 3868.3489999999997
actually so you got to realize that yeah

3865.95 --> 3871.2599999999998
I know he had that's why I said eggs and

3868.349 --> 3874.1600000000003
services as well that's what it's really

3871.26 --> 3876.84
about so I'm gonna round out the show

3874.16 --> 3878.16
thanks everyone for coming I hope you

3876.84 --> 3878.9
liked the show I thought it was

3878.16 --> 3881.31
interesting

3878.9 --> 3882.84
anyway if you did then please don't

3881.31 --> 3884.31

3900.77 --> 3906.15
that's very nice please keep them coming

3903.74 --> 3907.89
yeah yeah I'm gonna join the Flat Earth

3906.15 --> 3910.23
debates which has already started up in

3907.89 --> 3915.89
bitly and I'll be back tomorrow with

3910.23 --> 3917.78
flat earth earlybird number 507 67 right

3915.89 --> 3921.99
yeah

3917.78 --> 3925.38
hashtag MIFA indeed over mu cool Amanda

3921.99 --> 3928.8799999999997
yo and yeah until the next video

3925.38 --> 3928.88
give it flat

3928.94 --> 3951.869
[Music]

3954.49 --> 3956.5499999999997
