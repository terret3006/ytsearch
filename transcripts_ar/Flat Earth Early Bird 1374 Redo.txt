107.82 --> 112.86
beautiful bright

[Music]

193.379 --> 195.379

short show

202.96 --> 207.12
[Music]

204.48 --> 209.819
and it really was the copy

207.12 --> 212.519
I was kind of tense overall yesterday

209.819 --> 214.92
probably also because of the weather

212.519 --> 217.08
but they are drinking that coffee was

214.92 --> 219.35999999999999
just a really out of nowhere stupid

217.08 --> 222.5
action oh

219.36 --> 222.5
and what do you call that

222.54 --> 225.67999999999998
over courage

227.76 --> 231.89999999999998
weird

229.26 --> 234.17999999999998
and yeah it made me quite sick so

231.9 --> 235.62
yesterday I was kind of sick because of

234.18 --> 238.739
that

235.62 --> 240.06
but yeah I uh I almost had to throw up

238.739 --> 243.12
there

240.06 --> 244.799
but ended up not doing that

243.12 --> 246.18
but

244.799 --> 250.37900000000002
basically

246.18 --> 254.4
yeah went to the toilet a whole bunch

250.379 --> 258.419
and took a shower and then kind of slept

254.4 --> 260.1
for I think what it is like an hour

258.419 --> 262.32
so

260.1 --> 264.18
and after that it just took it really

262.32 --> 266.479
easy the rest of the day did not eat

264.18 --> 266.479
much

269.4 --> 272.35999999999996
went to bed

274.199 --> 277.62
not super late

276.12 --> 279.919
but yeah

277.62 --> 283.8
that was like

279.919 --> 287.15999999999997
a bit of a shock

283.8 --> 289.27000000000004
but I feel a lot better now and

287.16 --> 301.07000000000005
yeah never doing that again

289.27 --> 301.07
[Music]

302.46 --> 308.69899999999996
hello Chris legendbe why the redo well

306.78 --> 312.919

308.699 --> 312.91900000000004
minutes wasn't much of a show at all

315.18 --> 318.90000000000003
which is kind of a shame because

316.62 --> 321.5
normally Saturday shows are pretty good

318.9 --> 321.5
with me

321.72 --> 326.05
ah

322.78 --> 326.04999999999995
[Music]

326.88 --> 331.639
I think today you will be just fine

336.34 --> 341.59999999999997
[Music]

338.639 --> 341.6
but uh

344.58 --> 350.75899999999996
yeah so anyway I hope you guys had a

348.3 --> 354.68
pretty had a good day and all that

350.759 --> 354.68
better weather than I did

357.12 --> 359.9
uh

363.9 --> 369.0
by the way good servant are you like up

366.479 --> 370.919
all night or are you just up insanely

369.0 --> 373.139
early because

370.919 --> 375.12
you were pretty fast there and in the

373.139 --> 377.82
chat

375.12 --> 380.1
yeah yesterday there was a life fled

377.82 --> 382.52
Arthur

380.1 --> 382.52000000000004
show

382.979 --> 387.919
that's kind of fun hanging in the chat

385.62 --> 387.919
there

389.58 --> 394.5
also yeah he uses telegram I actually

392.34 --> 396.17999999999995
wanted to get on but my telegram doesn't

394.5 --> 398.639
work so I asked

396.18 --> 400.819
Adam meekin if perhaps he could help me

398.639 --> 400.819
out

407.22 --> 412.97900000000004
because yeah my telegram has been really

409.919 --> 416.039
oddly broken for like two years

412.979 --> 418.62
where I literally just cannot even make

416.039 --> 421.31899999999996
a new account or anything I just can't

418.62 --> 423.06
get it I just can't it's like oh yeah do

421.319 --> 426.66
the phone number and send a message no

423.06 --> 428.6
it doesn't done it like 50 times no it

426.66 --> 429.90000000000003
doesn't no matter what

428.6 --> 433.38
[Music]

429.9 --> 435.539
and you can't log in or like make a new

433.38 --> 437.52
account it's like totally bizarre I

435.539 --> 439.259
don't understand one bit of how this is

437.52 --> 441.29999999999995
supposed to work

439.259 --> 443.88
this is really bizarre I've installed

441.3 --> 444.84000000000003
new versions and it's all the same every

443.88 --> 447.71999999999997
time

444.84 --> 449.88
anyway hopefully Adam will be able to

447.72 --> 452.36
help me out a bit figure out what's

449.88 --> 452.36
going on

452.699 --> 456.08
hey territ 306

459.72 --> 463.34000000000003
I know PJ CNET

463.5 --> 469.139
it just it's stuck

466.86 --> 471.539
it stuck with me I didn't know maybe

469.139 --> 473.039
it's some really weird situation I don't

471.539 --> 475.02
understand because I keep really

473.039 --> 477.979
installing it it's the same problem all

475.02 --> 477.979
every single time

478.56 --> 483.919
could look I have removed it many times

486.419 --> 490.19899999999996
I know what I'm doing I know I'm I'm

488.46 --> 492.78
good with software management and

490.199 --> 494.759
keeping my computer clean and it's like

492.78 --> 497.04999999999995
the one thing with my computer that I'm

494.759 --> 499.86
really good at

497.05 --> 502.379
[Music]

499.86 --> 504.96000000000004
what the [ __ ] are you talking about

502.379 --> 506.14000000000004
temp sales

504.96 --> 509.29999999999995
what

506.14 --> 509.3
[Music]

516.49 --> 519.6
[Music]

521.159 --> 528.2
material

522.719 --> 528.2
right yeah no I know PJ CNET that's fine

528.839 --> 534.6
I do appreciate the tips

532.14 --> 539.399
but like it's a problem for like two

534.6 --> 541.26
years I mean every typical thingy

539.399 --> 543.899
that people would come up with I've

541.26 --> 546.72
tried them already multiple times

543.899 --> 548.88
because I I really did want it to get

546.72 --> 553.14
into Telegraph and it's so bizarre

548.88 --> 555.3
because I used to be in Telegram

553.14 --> 558.18
and it worked just fine and then just

555.3 --> 559.9799999999999
one day it just wouldn't let me in

558.18 --> 562.7399999999999
anymore

559.98 --> 564.54
and didn't doesn't say like oh you're

562.74 --> 567.0
doing it incorrect it's not like Oh no

564.54 --> 568.8
just send telephone number

567.0 --> 571.399
and then it just doesn't send you a

568.8 --> 571.399
message ever

572.339 --> 576.6800000000001
like gets blocked in their system or

574.5 --> 576.68
something

577.08 --> 579.5600000000001
anyway

580.62 --> 587.16
but yeah I need it because there it's

583.68 --> 588.7199999999999
like also the communication platform of

587.16 --> 592.0799999999999
my healer

588.72 --> 595.14
among other things

592.08 --> 596.4590000000001
and they are and my dad and they're

595.14 --> 599.6999999999999
really well

596.459 --> 602.64
explored with it so I I could get like a

599.7 --> 606.08
lot of reach

602.64 --> 606.08
but it just can't get on

610.62 --> 614.4590000000001
anyway

612.18 --> 617.519
right so yeah I've been finishing

614.459 --> 620.54
watching the fourth season

617.519 --> 620.54
Cobra Kai

620.88 --> 623.88
foreign

627.06 --> 633.26
yeah they well they're going for a fifth

629.82 --> 637.86
season that's blatantly obvious

633.26 --> 641.899
but it was interesting

637.86 --> 641.899
it's all very passionate

642.18 --> 646.019
but with made with passion and

644.16 --> 648.54
inspiration and

646.019 --> 651.54
but yeah as I already said like the

648.54 --> 654.959
first half of it especially was kind of

651.54 --> 657.66
just like so boxy a bit

654.959 --> 661.0999999999999
maybe in some way it didn't really work

657.66 --> 661.1
for the youngsters too well

661.5 --> 668.279
the older guys the older team right the

665.459 --> 669.5999999999999
the cost of the original the original

668.279 --> 671.88
movies

669.6 --> 672.9590000000001
they were just having the time of their

671.88 --> 676.26
life

672.959 --> 680.0999999999999
it was like I was like really

676.26 --> 683.959
drawn into that and I liked all of them

680.1 --> 683.9590000000001
they were all just Epic

684.0 --> 687.0
anyway

690.0 --> 694.38
hey Susie yes good to see you yeah I'm

692.339 --> 696.5400000000001
better

694.38 --> 699.18
yeah all I needed to do is just not

696.54 --> 701.6999999999999
drink coffee which I'd not even used to

699.18 --> 702.8599999999999
drinking in the morning on an empty

701.7 --> 706.6400000000001
stomach

702.86 --> 706.64

[Music]

[Music]

771.6 --> 774.6

806.399 --> 811.519
like your t-shirt it's your design yeah

809.339 --> 811.519
yeah

812.88 --> 820.38
a steamy traveler mate yeah

817.56 --> 824.66
I gave him the text and he and the

820.38 --> 824.66
picture of like the 10 star and all that

825.12 --> 830.339
and then his cousin or something who's

827.82 --> 834.74
into t-shirt companies

830.339 --> 838.0400000000001
made it so pretty cool can you buy them

834.74 --> 838.04
well no

844.86 --> 851.44
not at this time anyway

847.88 --> 851.4399999999999
[Music]

853.16 --> 857.39
you should get some merch

856.019 --> 860.58
Maybe

857.39 --> 860.58
[Music]

862.8 --> 868.459
I've tried it many times before but it's

865.86 --> 868.4590000000001
just not

868.68 --> 871.68
yes

872.339 --> 879.0600000000001
I mean there's like enough our win

875.399 --> 881.579
like sayings but I don't just want like

879.06 --> 882.959
the kind of funny sounding things or

881.579 --> 885.7199999999999
whatever

882.959 --> 888.779
I want it to be like basically

885.72 --> 891.24
glyphs like this where it's just a

888.779 --> 893.88
little bit of text that could if you

891.24 --> 895.0790000000001
understood what it is totally blow your

893.88 --> 898.519
mind

895.079 --> 898.519
that is kind of

898.92 --> 904.079
what I want if I'm gonna have merch

902.279 --> 906.8389999999999
right

904.079 --> 909.3599999999999
so that it's not even about

906.839 --> 912.6600000000001
like do the style or anything but that

909.36 --> 914.78
it's really about just the power of the

912.66 --> 917.16
glyph

914.78 --> 919.079
[Music]

917.16 --> 924.5
just of the words

919.079 --> 924.5
and the meaning of it and yeah maybe

924.66 --> 929.639
maybe there will be more and then

927.0 --> 932.399
eventually yeah I might have

929.639 --> 935.04
like some t-shirts or something

932.399 --> 938.06
right but not with the 10 star on it

935.04 --> 940.56
like I'm not doing that

938.06 --> 944.54
people have asked me before in the past

940.56 --> 944.54
like oh can I have that no

945.36 --> 949.62
you could try to make it yourself

947.82 --> 952.019
I'm not gonna do it

949.62 --> 953.94
because that's my symbol

952.019 --> 956.839
literally

953.94 --> 956.839
I claimed it

959.399 --> 962.579
this one

961.079 --> 965.3
right

962.579 --> 965.3
so

965.399 --> 970.38
like yeah wearing that either you have

968.76 --> 972.959
to claim it yourself but I'm not gonna

970.38 --> 975.6
give it to anybody because it's like the

972.959 --> 978.06
actual weight of the implications of its

975.6 --> 980.88
meaning it's a little bit too much for

978.06 --> 982.7399999999999
just general normies out there to have

980.88 --> 984.12
it even if they really like the way it

982.74 --> 987.0600000000001
looks

984.12 --> 990.38
I mean it's a pretty serious Priestly

987.06 --> 990.38
symbol to me

990.4 --> 998.1
[Music]

998.639 --> 1005.839
what was that ring yeah

1002.0 --> 1008.6

[Music]

1019.759 --> 1022.12

1024.62 --> 1029.1399999999999
and the weather is good I wear this one

1030.439 --> 1034.699
to meet the Sun

1032.959 --> 1037.24
and when the weather sucks or it's

1034.699 --> 1037.24
really cold

1038.839 --> 1046.1599999999999

1058.7 --> 1062.6000000000001
all right this one is like I couldn't

1060.98 --> 1066.74
wear that

1062.6 --> 1069.1399999999999
because it's like way too big but I made

1066.74 --> 1072.179
it specifically for around gloves

1069.14 --> 1072.179
[Music]

1079.53 --> 1086.8999999999999
[Music]

1083.08 --> 1089.36

1086.9 --> 1092.6000000000001
looking at the rest of my jacket which

1089.36 --> 1094.4599999999998
is like wearing so badly

1092.6 --> 1097.0
like I don't know how long it's gonna

1094.46 --> 1097.0
hold out

1097.039 --> 1102.44
okay I want a new one

1100.22 --> 1104.84
but yeah I've been wanting that for a

1102.44 --> 1105.14
couple of years now still working out

1104.84 --> 1107.9599999999998
though

1105.14 --> 1111.6200000000001
[Music]

1107.96 --> 1115.179
careful not to get it wet a lot

1111.62 --> 1115.1789999999999
but that's not good for the leather

1115.34 --> 1118.0
uh

1118.88 --> 1126.15
it'll survive this winter

1149.78 --> 1153.62

1153.799 --> 1158.26

1164.79 --> 1170.48
[Music]

1171.679 --> 1177.6200000000001
never thought of and over the glove ring

1174.2 --> 1180.82
yeah well it's kind of Darth vaderie

1177.62 --> 1180.82
like or

1182.36 --> 1187.6999999999998
Darth helmet actually when when you

1185.179 --> 1190.8200000000002
really think about it silly right but

1187.7 --> 1192.679
yeah Darth helmet is like a Darth Vader

1190.82 --> 1195.559
a little Grappler though with a huge

1192.679 --> 1198.0800000000002
helmet does wear gloves and then he has

1195.559 --> 1200.62
his Swatch ring that he puts on top of

1198.08 --> 1200.62
his glove

1203.84 --> 1209.48
it doesn't make it very badass to point

1207.32 --> 1213.799
that out by the way but

1209.48 --> 1216.38
it does have yeah it has a power because

1213.799 --> 1218.539
just the way it looks it's cool because

1216.38 --> 1220.64
I'm pretty much all black like

1218.539 --> 1224.36
everything

1220.64 --> 1226.94
except my my face the rest is all black

1224.36 --> 1229.24
and then just have a ring kind of stand

1226.94 --> 1229.24

1314.36 --> 1317.08
been using

1318.559 --> 1324.799
I don't even have a smartphone to use it

1321.86 --> 1328.52
with that's the point if I did then I

1324.799 --> 1330.08
could do their stupid little code thingy

1328.52 --> 1333.1399999999999
scan

1330.08 --> 1335.539
I can't do that

1333.14 --> 1339.14
because the code thing you scan is

1335.539 --> 1341.72
somehow a way to get in

1339.14 --> 1344.7800000000002
you only yeah yeah that's what I'm

1341.72 --> 1349.659
trying with my phone

and I use somebody else's phone

1379.28 --> 1384.559
just to get me in I mean

1381.799 --> 1386.059
they could literally

1384.559 --> 1388.52
do that

1386.059 --> 1390.74
like I could literally share my screen

1388.52 --> 1393.559
with that stupid code they could scan it

1390.74 --> 1395.0
then have their text message I don't

1393.559 --> 1398.059
think it matters

1395.0 --> 1400.76
then I get the text message

1398.059 --> 1403.28
and use it to get in and then at least I

1400.76 --> 1407.539
can activate it and then see if I could

1403.28 --> 1408.799
like set the login or whatever

1407.539 --> 1411.26
right

1408.799 --> 1415.059

1822.26 --> 1828.94
actually be exposed

1825.2 --> 1828.94
to my internal world then

1831.039 --> 1835.539

I have a good hearing I inherited it

1950.72 --> 1956.3
from my mother who had like a surreal

1954.559 --> 1958.82
quality hearing

1956.3 --> 1961.82
[Music]

1958.82 --> 1964.8799999999999

1961.82 --> 1968.54

1964.88 --> 1971.779
like to the maximum

1968.54 --> 1974.899
[Music]

1971.779 --> 1977.36
I mean my mother was like she would be

1974.899 --> 1979.34
able to pick out interesting music that

1977.36 --> 1982.36
would be really fascinating

1979.34 --> 1982.36
among everything

1982.88 --> 1987.74
so you just know like this is

1985.22 --> 1991.64
interesting music and here's why and I

1987.74 --> 1994.8990000000001
kind of totally resonated with that so

1991.64 --> 1994.8990000000001
I have a pretty good hearing

1995.96 --> 2001.6200000000001
decent auditory capabilities better than

1999.2 --> 2001.6200000000001
my mother

2002.14 --> 2006.46
verbally my mother was not super

2004.84 --> 2009.1
fantastic

2006.46 --> 2011.74
I mean she could absolutely cope with

2009.1 --> 2015.2199999999998
the intelligence that she had

2011.74 --> 2017.14
but she like I'm better at it

2015.22 --> 2020.22
I think I got that from my dad it was

2017.14 --> 2020.22
kind of natural at it

2022.84 --> 2029.1999999999998
my dad's a pretty good smooth talker

2026.2 --> 2029.2
ah

2036.039 --> 2042.58
so yeah if people think my voice is a

2039.159 --> 2045.3990000000001
bit whiny I got that part from my mother

2042.58 --> 2048.419
and my dad yeah that's where I got the

2045.399 --> 2048.419
bass range from

2174.88 --> 2181.6600000000003
dearness lost his mind over Nathan yeah

2178.42 --> 2183.94
it is weird isn't it I know

2181.66 --> 2186.52
just yeah that's exactly what I said

2183.94 --> 2190.079
because I am baffled over it like why

2186.52 --> 2190.079
this did this just happen

2190.359 --> 2195.22
when he is always

2193.54 --> 2197.44
stepped out

2195.22 --> 2200.22
every time

2197.44 --> 2200.2200000000003
wisely

2200.619 --> 2207.4
and now he doesn't and he's just

2203.14 --> 2210.8199999999997
completely losing it

2207.4 --> 2212.7400000000002
like cohesion is just crumbling off him

2210.82 --> 2214.54
like

2212.74 --> 2217.0
foreign

2214.54 --> 2219.7799999999997

Nathan post

2250.78 --> 2253.98
what are you talking about

2267.4 --> 2273.2400000000002
Jaren is mad because crypto is bad is is

2270.339 --> 2273.24
that it Taryn

2274.839 --> 2279.5789999999997
I mean I know Jaren really went full in

2277.78 --> 2283.26
on the crypto thing

2279.579 --> 2283.26
I don't know what he's risk

2284.26 --> 2291.599
I have no idea he might now be like

2287.5 --> 2294.94
having like this sudden bizarre debt

2291.599 --> 2297.839
unexpectedly and maybe yeah well that

2294.94 --> 2297.839
would [ __ ] me up too

2298.48 --> 2304.44
but I don't know

2301.24 --> 2304.4399999999996
I don't know what he's doing

2309.24 --> 2317.2599999999998
saying Nathan started [ __ ] really

2314.26 --> 2317.26
wow

2320.92 --> 2327.4
dude

2323.38 --> 2330.6600000000003
that is just ridiculous

2327.4 --> 2330.6600000000003
I mean really

2330.72 --> 2337.4199999999996
seriously I mean

2333.4 --> 2339.52
Nathan has been in these years

2337.42 --> 2343.9
constantly

2339.52 --> 2343.9
and to my personal annoyance

2343.96 --> 2350.579
been constantly like holding us back

2347.859 --> 2353.619
from just going full on against

2350.579 --> 2356.1400000000003
globusters for their behavior like he's

2353.619 --> 2358.06
been the one that's actually holding us

2356.14 --> 2361.839
back I don't know if you guys kind of

2358.06 --> 2363.22
paid attention he has done that quite a

2361.839 --> 2365.7599999999998
few times

2363.22 --> 2365.7599999999998
like

2366.04 --> 2370.48
trying to cool things down and all that

2368.32 --> 2371.98
every time they say something stupid

2370.48 --> 2375.04
again

2371.98 --> 2379.2
and now they're saying that Nathan

2375.04 --> 2379.2
started [ __ ] this is just

2380.38 --> 2384.96
just a blatant offense

2385.3 --> 2390.579
this is just bullying

2388.06 --> 2394.9

2390.579 --> 2397.8

2410.46 --> 2417.76
I mean Nathan will tear people apart

2413.46 --> 2421.359
right but he never starts [ __ ]

2417.76 --> 2423.88
other than get really silly jokes that

2421.359 --> 2426.339
might be slightly out of normal taste or

2423.88 --> 2429.96
something right he does that but he

2426.339 --> 2429.96
never actually starts [ __ ]

2435.82 --> 2441.76
like not out of nowhere

2439.119 --> 2444.0
it's always reasonable

2441.76 --> 2444.0
foreign

2458.8 --> 2464.52
yeah yeah that's pretty On Target

2461.98 --> 2466.0

2528.16 --> 2533.7
this

2530.44 --> 2533.7000000000003
what about it

2538.24 --> 2545.5789999999997
I mean he's obviously descended from a

2541.9 --> 2545.579
cave troll and Bigfoot

2554.619 --> 2560.32
just kidding

2556.48 --> 2562.07
I hope you realize that was a joke

uh

2562.07 --> 2565.28

2566.74 --> 2571.8999999999996

2568.9 --> 2573.2200000000003
cave troll analogy that I did those

2571.9 --> 2575.7400000000002
years ago

2573.22 --> 2578.5789999999997
Bob must have not been very happy about

2575.74 --> 2578.5789999999997
me doing that

2580.72 --> 2583.7999999999997

2583.24 --> 2585.52
a bit

2583.8 --> 2588.96
[Music]

2585.52 --> 2588.96
not one bit

2596.44 --> 2600.56
why is jiren going against Christians

2598.359 --> 2601.7799999999997
well because he thinks probably that

2600.56 --> 2604.42
[Music]

2601.78 --> 2605.3190000000004
there will be plenty of people that are

2604.42 --> 2607.359
fine

2605.319 --> 2610.18
with him doing that

2607.359 --> 2612.7
that don't like Christianity I mean in a

2610.18 --> 2614.8799999999997
way I'd attract them too with my

2612.7 --> 2614.8799999999997
position

2615.579 --> 2620.7400000000002
right because my view on Jesus Christ is

2618.76 --> 2624.579
quite

2620.74 --> 2626.2
the contrast with like what was the

2624.579 --> 2629.46
official

2626.2 --> 2629.46
opinion about it

2629.619 --> 2635.619
but I definitely do respect Jesus's

2632.92 --> 2636.87
teachings the words

2635.619 --> 2640.06
just the words

2636.87 --> 2643.0
[Music]

2640.06 --> 2646.24
right and but yeah Jaren seems to think

2643.0 --> 2648.64
like it's all just trash it's all just

2646.24 --> 2652.1189999999997
oh no my God would never do that that's

2648.64 --> 2653.859
just his ultimate catchphrase my God

2652.119 --> 2655.7200000000003
would never do that my God would never

2653.859 --> 2658.66
do that

2655.72 --> 2662.2599999999998
his God is kind of a wussy

2658.66 --> 2663.2999999999997
and super overly sentimental and

2662.26 --> 2664.78
kind of an idiot

[Music]

2664.78 --> 2669.8390000000004

2667.06 --> 2669.839
listen to All That

2671.02 --> 2673.92
foreign

2674.98 --> 2682.8
[Music]

2677.4 --> 2682.8
's God is like the ultimate nanny

2682.9 --> 2686.579
that's what it seems like to me

2702.48 --> 2709.66
your roommate is Eugene Bigfoot

2706.72 --> 2712.3799999999997
she would lose it

2709.66 --> 2712.3799999999997
well

2716.2 --> 2721.24
yeah

2718.48 --> 2724.96
I mean I'm definitely open to the idea

2721.24 --> 2727.06
I'm also very much aware that it's so

2724.96 --> 2729.9
triggering

2727.06 --> 2729.9
that it is

2731.5 --> 2736.2
it's like the people that have the

2733.24 --> 2737.74
sensories for that are also

2736.2 --> 2741.339
schizoid

2737.74 --> 2744.0989999999997
adjacent at least

2741.339 --> 2746.14
right that because that just kind of

2744.099 --> 2749.02
allows you to see those types of things

2746.14 --> 2751.7799999999997
just as you might see like more

2749.02 --> 2755.22
emphasized ghosts or whatever

2751.78 --> 2757.8390000000004
or your voices and [ __ ] and so

2755.22 --> 2759.7599999999998
yeah people that have just slight

2757.839 --> 2762.4
Tendencies about that will be more

2759.76 --> 2765.3
likely to believe in Bigfoot and try to

2762.4 --> 2765.3
investigate that

2766.0 --> 2771.0
I don't know if it's literally real but

2768.64 --> 2774.339
as like a sort of extra dimensional

2771.0 --> 2779.22
creature that can manifest

2774.339 --> 2779.22
I am open to the possibility of that

2782.079 --> 2788.6800000000003
it would be mind-blowing if I'd ever

2784.72 --> 2791.02
actually experienced that in in person

2788.68 --> 2793.24
but even in the Dark World there was

2791.02 --> 2795.78
like a whole thing about it

2793.24 --> 2795.7799999999997
there

2798.22 --> 2803.98
I mean I yeah it might have been a

2800.68 --> 2807.0989999999997
complete illusion just to kind of hook

2803.98 --> 2809.44
me into it but I never had like a bad

2807.099 --> 2812.079
impression from Bigfoot

2809.44 --> 2814.7200000000003
even just no matter what people say

2812.079 --> 2817.48
about it right just

2814.72 --> 2819.5789999999997
the men spiritual metadata

2817.48 --> 2823.42
I never thought like oh Bigfoot oh

2819.579 --> 2826.599
didn't use bad or no

2823.42 --> 2830.319
and in the dark world I had a segment

2826.599 --> 2833.7400000000002
where I would literally like go to them

2830.319 --> 2836.079
like in their pocket dimension

2833.74 --> 2840.0989999999997
really like a pocket Dimension that

2836.079 --> 2842.079
don't don't man I just experienced it I

2840.099 --> 2845.44
did design it

2842.079 --> 2847.8390000000004
what happened to me

2845.44 --> 2850.42
we're in a pocket Dimension like in the

2847.839 --> 2853.42
woods around the fire

2850.42 --> 2855.78
and just a whole bunch of hairy guys and

2853.42 --> 2855.78
girls

2856.599 --> 2859.9
and they were just as intelligent as

2858.819 --> 2862.48
people

2859.9 --> 2865.8
and they were like a tribe and they were

2862.48 --> 2865.8
actually really spiritual

2866.92 --> 2871.5
and not evil and very aware of that

2871.96 --> 2876.2200000000003
so

2873.64 --> 2879.66
yeah well within that experience at

2876.22 --> 2885.6499999999996
least I that strengthened my Affinity

2879.66 --> 2885.6499999999996
[Music]

2885.88 --> 2889.0
and it doesn't mean that I'm like

2887.44 --> 2890.68
totally obsessed with Bigfoot or

2889.0 --> 2893.38
anything no not at all

2890.68 --> 2895.359
I regularly forget about it again

2893.38 --> 2899.5
it's just that

2895.359 --> 2903.66
upon confrontation I wouldn't

2899.5 --> 2905.619
be I would know what to do I think

2903.66 --> 2908.16
intuitively

2905.619 --> 2908.1600000000003
anyway

2920.44 --> 2925.319
all right but look it's complicated

2925.66 --> 2931.839
if you would think

2927.88 --> 2934.96
that Bigfoot might be like

2931.839 --> 2938.44
an extra dimensional Spirit like aliens

2934.96 --> 2941.98
could be although aliens are typically

2938.44 --> 2943.18
very aromatic they are not of good

2941.98 --> 2945.7
spirit

2943.18 --> 2947.56
well and you just say like oh well maybe

2945.7 --> 2950.0789999999997
the Bigfoot are like

2947.56 --> 2952.9
good spirits like that not like Angels

2950.079 --> 2954.819
but like good nature spirits that can

2952.9 --> 2957.339
literally physically manifest to and

2954.819 --> 2960.099
they're like in a pocket Dimension which

2957.339 --> 2962.5
is synchronous to the physical reality

2960.099 --> 2966.54
and they just

2962.5 --> 2966.54
live a very simple life there

2970.0 --> 2976.619
yeah

2971.98 --> 2976.619
but do they have some Grand task

2977.38 --> 2982.599
I'd not they are not like guardians or

2981.22 --> 2986.02
anything

2982.599 --> 2990.06
they're more like keepers of Purity and

2986.02 --> 2990.06
extremely old wisdom

2999.52 --> 3007.02
also I'm not sure if they actually age

3003.54 --> 3009.96
in the pocket dimension

3007.02 --> 3013.98
maybe that that's actually like Eden

3009.96 --> 3016.98
maybe they have still access to Eden

3013.98 --> 3020.099
in the sort of way

3016.98 --> 3021.96
I don't know I'm expanding the mythology

3020.099 --> 3025.04
now

3021.96 --> 3025.04
it's all guesswork

3026.579 --> 3030.7200000000003
partially based on what I experienced in

3028.74 --> 3033.9599999999996
the visions

3030.72 --> 3037.859
but my mother also was like

3033.96 --> 3040.319
she believed in Sasquatch

3037.859 --> 3042.74
and she said that she had seen Sasquatch

3040.319 --> 3042.74
too

3045.24 --> 3049.7999999999997
might have even been part of the reason

3047.099 --> 3052.04
why we went to the United States not

3049.8 --> 3052.04
sure

3053.579 --> 3056.1800000000003
anyway

3060.119 --> 3065.6400000000003
Angels and Demons

3063.059 --> 3068.52
well what if the Angels and Demons just

3065.64 --> 3072.48
keep taking new forms

3068.52 --> 3075.839
like they just transmuted into a new

3072.48 --> 3077.28
format depending on what

3075.839 --> 3080.339
what actually happens in the physical

3077.28 --> 3083.7200000000003
world and how our minds work

3080.339 --> 3083.72
if you ever considered that

3083.94 --> 3088.68
I mean would the angels and the demons

3086.22 --> 3090.8999999999996
just always appear as the same damn

3088.68 --> 3092.339
thing

3090.9 --> 3095.099
I mean

3092.339 --> 3099.2999999999997
for an angel that might be kind of

3095.099 --> 3101.3590000000004
useful for some specific reason but for

3099.3 --> 3103.619
a demon that's not useful at all because

3101.359 --> 3105.72
if it's always the same then everybody

3103.619 --> 3107.46
gets used to it and then it's not scary

3105.72 --> 3110.24
because it's a thing that you don't know

3107.46 --> 3110.2400000000002
that is scary

3111.48 --> 3116.819
so for demons to constantly transform

3114.9 --> 3119.2200000000003
into new

3116.819 --> 3123.18
types of

3119.22 --> 3125.5789999999997
extra dimensional beings is only logical

3123.18 --> 3127.44
because if they stayed the same then how

3125.579 --> 3130.559
are they scary everybody would just know

3127.44 --> 3134.18
oh it's that yeah just don't

3130.559 --> 3134.1800000000003
this is exactly what will happen

3139.19 --> 3145.46
[Music]

3145.64 --> 3151.52
I don't know who that is

3148.92 --> 3151.52
what

3166.099 --> 3173.3
they could probably appear as they wish

3170.46 --> 3178.4
well yeah Sasquatch I think can actually

3173.3 --> 3178.4
just manifest exactly like humans

3180.96 --> 3187.859
one could even bizarrely argue that from

3184.859 --> 3189.66
an from the standpoint that they are

3187.859 --> 3191.42
extra dimensionals and don't have an

3189.66 --> 3193.7999999999997
inherent body and probably

3191.42 --> 3197.839
mostly manifest

3193.8 --> 3197.8390000000004
in people's dream experiences

3198.599 --> 3202.7400000000002
that

3200.88 --> 3205.559
yeah

3202.74 --> 3208.68
like what if they

3205.559 --> 3211.3190000000004
big feet were actually for example the

3208.68 --> 3213.859
the nordics right remember the Nordic

3211.319 --> 3213.859
aliens

3217.74 --> 3223.3999999999996
what if they were actually like a form

3228.78 --> 3233.6600000000003
because I think that they can do that

3233.78 --> 3237.8590000000004
not Sasquatch okay

3249.96 --> 3254.54
I'm just trying to be a little

3251.64 --> 3254.54
open-minded here

3262.079 --> 3268.1400000000003
demons monsters are actually what

3264.54 --> 3272.3
doesn't it's all just a word

3268.14 --> 3272.2999999999997
it's all just words and experiences

3278.88 --> 3283.079
that's quite different species of humans

3281.16 --> 3285.98
right

3283.079 --> 3285.98
yeah could be

3293.4 --> 3298.2000000000003
but in a way they might even be

3296.04 --> 3301.7
considered as like ascended humans

3298.2 --> 3301.7
sounds weird right

3303.96 --> 3307.68
because

3304.98 --> 3310.8
all my encounters

3307.68 --> 3312.72
were in the dark world were that they

3310.8 --> 3316.98
are extremely

3312.72 --> 3319.2599999999998
spiritually sensitive and advanced

3316.98 --> 3321.18
not necessarily intellectually but

3319.26 --> 3323.099
spiritually like they have sensories

3321.18 --> 3326.54
that are

3323.099 --> 3326.54
super refined

3327.839 --> 3332.5789999999997
they can figure out everything that's

3329.88 --> 3335.099
going on inside of you

3332.579 --> 3338.0
I guess I would call them natural

3335.099 --> 3338.0
empaths

3338.46 --> 3342.079
because I have that too

3347.339 --> 3352.859
but I am not

3349.26 --> 3355.559
like pure in them like they were this is

3352.859 --> 3358.38
all just me comparing my Dark World

3355.559 --> 3362.3

3358.38 --> 3362.3

the observation deck Channel no I'd

3489.359 --> 3492.0789999999997
never heard of that

3523.92 --> 3530.119
Moon confessions

3526.74 --> 3530.1189999999997
is that what are you talking about

3530.819 --> 3536.579
is that about that guy

3533.52 --> 3539.4
who recently died who

3536.579 --> 3542.52
took his dad's confession about how they

3539.4 --> 3546.0
made the moon landing in the studio

3542.52 --> 3548.94
I definitely heard about it

3546.0 --> 3552.42
oh also Michael Khan like uploaded a

3548.94 --> 3556.16
video about that and actually got like a

3552.42 --> 3556.16
a copyright claim

3585.18 --> 3590.96
a really high quality okay I'll check it

3588.839 --> 3590.96

3649.559 --> 3653.7200000000003
didn't get bumped off what

3672.059 --> 3674.599
hmm

3676.74 --> 3684.359
yeah cool PJ scene yeah me too I met him

3680.04 --> 3687.619
in I think 2010.

3684.359 --> 3687.619
some convention

3689.16 --> 3693.92
in the Netherlands

3690.839 --> 3693.92
and that was pretty cool

3709.81 --> 3712.96
[Music]

3713.88 --> 3717.6600000000003
lizard people it's total nonsense I

3716.76 --> 3720.96
think

3717.66 --> 3724.799
it's just a reification I mean do you

3720.96 --> 3728.339
even know how he got that story

3724.799 --> 3732.18
it was through his shamanic experiences

3728.339 --> 3734.88
so he's probably had like

3732.18 --> 3736.68
Ayahuasca or something

3734.88 --> 3741.1400000000003
from his shaman

3736.68 --> 3741.14
and he just saw that [ __ ]

3743.04 --> 3750.619
so he probably like the lizard people is

3746.46 --> 3750.619
probably like a spiritual metaphor

3752.0 --> 3760.7
that in his mind he just

3756.119 --> 3760.7000000000003
reified it like that's literal

3763.68 --> 3769.5589999999997
like it's not a flatty is he no

3767.04 --> 3772.38
but he is tolerant of flatter I

3769.559 --> 3775.2200000000003
confronted him with flat Earth in 2010

3772.38 --> 3775.2200000000003
face to face

3775.619 --> 3781.6800000000003
he said I I don't really get into that

3778.68 --> 3783.96
and then I told him like okay but

3781.68 --> 3786.0
just make sure you don't attack it

3783.96 --> 3790.16
because this is like an actual real

3786.0 --> 3790.16
Revolution and it's all true

3793.02 --> 3799.74
yeah this was before 2015 I know weird

3796.38 --> 3802.92
right yeah because I forgot it again

3799.74 --> 3808.0989999999997
after that in 2012.

3802.92 --> 3808.099
where I got mind wiped because well

3808.74 --> 3813.4799999999996
my girlfriend basically was gonna break

3811.319 --> 3819.44
up with me I felt

3813.48 --> 3819.44
so I just like self-destructed all of it

3821.52 --> 3827.22
but yeah in 2010 I faced David Ike with

3825.54 --> 3830.2799999999997
flat Earth

3827.22 --> 3833.04
and he was understanding and tolerant he

3830.28 --> 3834.48
even said like yeah I do understand that

3833.04 --> 3835.859
there are some real things there it's

3834.48 --> 3838.5
just like

3835.859 --> 3841.7
he I think he remembered him saying like

3838.5 --> 3841.7
I can't look there

3852.42 --> 3858.0
or maybe he has since then I don't know

3855.359 --> 3860.7
it doesn't really look like it

3858.0 --> 3864.359
I mean after all that

3860.7 --> 3866.7599999999998
had the whole weird Hollow Moon

3864.359 --> 3869.819
space station Theory and now we got Moon

3866.76 --> 3874.5200000000004
Falls which I really think is based on

3869.819 --> 3874.52
like David Ike I really think it is

what the hell are you guys talking about

3982.98 --> 3989.42
right BGC net yeah that's a very

3985.559 --> 3989.42
sensible thing to say to me

3989.88 --> 3995.819
I mean they get exposed by extreme dark

3993.66 --> 3998.64
things

3995.819 --> 4000.44
and they have to keep secrecy all the

3998.64 --> 4003.14
time

4000.44 --> 4004.579
it's gonna create cavities in your

4003.14 --> 4007.5789999999997
spirit

4004.579 --> 4009.5
and then they will be filled up by

4007.579 --> 4012.44
entities

4009.5 --> 4015.819
that are basically going to help you

4012.44 --> 4015.819
keep doing what you do

4017.539 --> 4022.2200000000003
and then those influences might have

4020.0 --> 4023.539
like psychedelic side effects on those

4022.22 --> 4026.319
with

4023.539 --> 4026.3190000000004

the active pineal gland

4031.46 --> 4035.92
like Snap Snap visions

4068.42 --> 4073.64
oh right from wrong they just choose to

4070.94 --> 4075.5
be evil well

4073.64 --> 4078.14
yes

4075.5 --> 4079.96
but the evil is not the objective the

4078.14 --> 4083.1189999999997
evil is just the

4079.96 --> 4084.5
unfortunate necessary

4083.119 --> 4087.1400000000003
weight

4084.5 --> 4090.7
to them because it's really about order

4087.14 --> 4090.7
and control over time

4092.48 --> 4096.44
and that well with

4096.44 --> 4101.0599999999995
the queen I think at least

4098.66 --> 4103.8189999999995
had priority

4101.06 --> 4106.52
over morality order had priority over

4103.819 --> 4109.719
morality and she took that to the

4106.52 --> 4109.719
as far as she could

4117.62 --> 4124.759
but she was also a fan of 1984 so that

4121.46 --> 4127.04
keeping of order also means mentally

4124.759 --> 4131.299
attacking

4127.04 --> 4132.799
her own people her own culture

4131.299 --> 4136.42
to

4132.799 --> 4139.46
basically yeah keep them under control

4136.42 --> 4144.04
that was just an over tactic and it's

4139.46 --> 4144.04
super evil but she did it to keep order

4210.92 --> 4215.06

4213.02 --> 4216.110000000001

but that's because the spiritual

4301.82 --> 4308.08
experience is the natural experience and

4304.28 --> 4308.08
you just kind of force it

4308.3 --> 4311.860000000001
with psychotropics

4312.08 --> 4320.0
it is basically a psychedelic experience

4314.54 --> 4323.719
like it the core root it is psychedelic

4320.0 --> 4328.12
The Irregular sensory input

4323.719 --> 4328.12
like out of the order out of the normal

4330.92 --> 4336.1990000000005

4333.5 --> 4338.0
interacting with somebody tension starts

4336.199 --> 4341.799999999999
to build up you might not be conscious

4338.0 --> 4344.06

you just get

4351.14 --> 4356.4800000000005

you get to see it

nothing correct for curvature courage

6163.56 --> 6168.179
isn't

6164.699 --> 6170.82
a reification of

6168.179 --> 6173.9
Optical

6170.82 --> 6173.9
yeah perception

6175.26 --> 6179.5
the suggestion of geometry where there

6177.54 --> 6182.4
actually is none

6179.5 --> 6183.9
[Music]

6182.4 --> 6186.659
never been to the Netherlands sounds

6183.9 --> 6187.3099999999995
like it's nicer than the UK well I think

6186.659 --> 6190.839
so yeah

6187.31 --> 6190.839000000001
[Music]

6191.04 --> 6194.4
I mean

6192.48 --> 6198.299999999999
we have like

6194.4 --> 6203.5199999999995
a lot of beautiful nature and

6198.3 --> 6204.78
there's like serious organization

6203.52 --> 6208.860000000001
like

6204.78 --> 6211.139
a lot it's pretty high tech I think even

6208.86 --> 6213.42
I mean it's not like super super oh

6211.139 --> 6216.84
maybe it is I don't even know but like

6213.42 --> 6220.04
we use pretty Advanced of the people out

6216.84 --> 6223.860000000001
there use pretty Advanced Machinery for

6220.04 --> 6228.0199999999995
nature management and

6223.86 --> 6228.0199999999995
garbage trucks are pretty advanced

6228.659 --> 6233.82
like good Machinery lots of nature

6231.96 --> 6236.219
management and just there's green

6233.82 --> 6238.139
everywhere like we make it our business

6236.219 --> 6241.26
now to put green everywhere and that's

6238.139 --> 6244.28
like one of the few things that

6241.26 --> 6246.96
one of the few reliefs

6244.28 --> 6250.44
about how things went in the Netherlands

6246.96 --> 6251.58
that at least their advanced advanced

6250.44 --> 6254.94
green

6251.58 --> 6259.08
and not just [ __ ] climate change and

6254.94 --> 6262.379999999999
CO2 cutting off high tech not just that

6259.08 --> 6265.5
it would also just actual investment in

6262.38 --> 6267.84
making things green and

6265.5 --> 6270.48
non-poisonous

6267.84 --> 6273.26
so yeah I really like that part about

6270.48 --> 6273.259999999999
the Netherlands

6274.5 --> 6282.54
right just look I mean realize

6279.84 --> 6286.9800000000005
I'm in a city

6282.54 --> 6290.46
this is not like Suburban

6286.98 --> 6292.619
this is urban I'm not in the middle of

6290.46 --> 6295.02
the city but even right in the dead

6292.619 --> 6298.199
middle of the city there's pretty much

6295.02 --> 6301.5
trees in a lot of places

6298.199 --> 6303.78
but this is like one of the biggest

6301.5 --> 6306.659
cities in the Netherlands it will just

6303.78 --> 6311.36
look at how much freaking green is

6306.659 --> 6311.36
everywhere it's I'm literally surrounded

6311.639 --> 6316.5
I mean that's pretty Epic

6314.219 --> 6318.179
also part of the reasons why I really

6316.5 --> 6320.94
like it here

6318.179 --> 6324.42
and have been able to just live here in

6320.94 --> 6326.04
a in a box almost

6324.42 --> 6329.4
four

6326.04 --> 6331.8
almost a decade this is just so much

6329.4 --> 6333.92
green everywhere that makes up for it a

6331.8 --> 6333.92
lot

6335.55 --> 6340.38
[Music]

6337.98 --> 6343.0199999999995
if they left Farmers alone now no

6340.38 --> 6346.139
unfortunately not yet

6343.02 --> 6348.2390000000005
although farmers are getting a lot of

6346.139 --> 6350.88
support from the people

6348.239 --> 6352.98
and more importantly people are actually

6350.88 --> 6355.5
realizing there's something really

6352.98 --> 6358.379999999999
really wrong with the politics this is

6355.5 --> 6360.48
really they are going

6358.38 --> 6364.7390000000005
like full dictator and it's getting

6360.48 --> 6367.678999999999
overt they're like overtly now double

6364.739 --> 6369.178999999999
speaking in a way it's worse than what

6367.679 --> 6372.3
even happens in the United States

6369.179 --> 6374.04
although the damage there is probably

6372.3 --> 6376.08
more

6374.04 --> 6379.38
but they're like really getting into

6376.08 --> 6382.26
psychological warfare now this

6379.38 --> 6386.84
this cartel

6382.26 --> 6386.84
of politicians here all these marxists

6394.56 --> 6397.56
bro

6398.82 --> 6403.32
sounds like Timothy P Southwick has a

6401.46 --> 6406.58
bit of savanye syndrome

6403.32 --> 6406.58
what the [ __ ] is your point

6409.699 --> 6416.299999999999
why would I block you if you just have

6413.159 --> 6416.299999999999
good things to say

6418.619 --> 6422.88
but if you're just gonna be whining

6420.6 --> 6425.34
about getting blocked or something like

6422.88 --> 6427.38
that and not actually have good

6425.34 --> 6429.179
information to share like you have yeah

6427.38 --> 6431.58
then I will block you and there's

6429.179 --> 6435.38
nothing anybody can do about it

6431.58 --> 6438.6
see my chat policy is very much

6435.38 --> 6442.639
behavioral based

6438.6 --> 6442.639
and that will not be changed

6442.739 --> 6446.58
and if you're just going to spend all

6444.6 --> 6448.1990000000005
your time complaining about it then you

6446.58 --> 6451.139
will just be banned and there's nothing

6448.199 --> 6454.138999999999
you can do to change that

6451.139 --> 6455.82
you can do though is just let it go and

6454.139 --> 6459.56
just do what you did

6455.82 --> 6459.5599999999995
share good info why not

6462.9 --> 6466.46
that's not going to get you banned

foreign

6487.02 --> 6490.02
required

6493.92 --> 6499.26
yeah and I think that in the Netherlands

6497.76 --> 6502.5
that is

6499.26 --> 6504.4800000000005
probably the majority I think that I

6502.5 --> 6505.82
mean organic

6504.48 --> 6509.94
food

6505.82 --> 6512.219
is almost like a Dutch thing it's like

6509.94 --> 6514.678999999999
that's been really

6512.219 --> 6518.94
we were one of the progenitors in ways

6514.679 --> 6521.639
of of like getting that thing out there

6518.94 --> 6525.659
Netherlands is really big into organic

6521.639 --> 6530.159000000001
food I mean you cannot find a single

6525.659 --> 6532.679
like uh grocery store that does not have

6530.159 --> 6533.46
any organic products you will not find

6532.679 --> 6535.26
them

6533.46 --> 6538.56
they all have it

6535.26 --> 6541.02
and there's completely hundred percent

6538.56 --> 6544.139
organic exclusive stores where only

6541.02 --> 6545.280000000001
organic products are multiple I go to

6544.139 --> 6547.52
one

6545.28 --> 6550.82
right

6569.639 --> 6573.4400000000005
why why did you do that

6573.659 --> 6579.42
you didn't need to do that why did you

6576.36 --> 6581.219
have to be a complainy whiny pants why

6579.42 --> 6583.88
didn't you just share good info and

6581.219 --> 6583.88
leave it to that

6585.179 --> 6590.52
I literally warned you exactly what

6587.88 --> 6592.86
would happen and you did it anyway you

6590.52 --> 6597.02

6592.86 --> 6597.0199999999995

uh

6790.98 --> 6796.379999999999
it's

6793.199 --> 6801.379999999999
pretty dramatic

yeah no [ __ ] why do you think I was like

6818.88 --> 6824.36
last month like hey

6821.1 --> 6824.360000000001
I got a problem

6832.139 --> 6836.84
that's why your rent went up yeah it is

6840.54 --> 6846.179
because I don't literally pay for the

6844.08 --> 6851.36
electricity and

6846.179 --> 6851.36
and the gas myself it's included

6851.76 --> 6857.639
but yeah

6853.5 --> 6860.88
it is up my rent for like 60 Euros

6857.639 --> 6866.179
when it's already been upped

6860.88 --> 6866.179
for 30 Euros in April

6867.06 --> 6871.400000000001
so yeah pretty freaking dramatic

6872.699 --> 6879.419999999999
I mean my rent practically went up

6876.239 --> 6882.739
a total 20 percent

6879.42 --> 6882.7390000000005
a hundred euros

6890.94 --> 6896.4
does my assistance go up well not so far

6893.639 --> 6899.159000000001
I mean it should

6896.4 --> 6902.839999999999
it's not happening though I haven't had

6899.159 --> 6902.839999999999
any sign of that

6903.78 --> 6910.98
I mean they they sent out like a sort of

6906.54 --> 6912.48
a bonus in April to compensate and that

6910.98 --> 6915.138999999999
was what that was it that was just a

6912.48 --> 6915.138999999999
one-time thing

6918.84 --> 6925.68
and yeah it's not gonna compensate for

6922.199 --> 6945.83
the total situation at all

[Music]

6952.219 --> 6955.7390000000005
Ransom by the greens you mean by the

6954.48 --> 6957.9
Communists

6955.739 --> 6959.459999999999
it's communism this is what communism

6957.9 --> 6960.839999999999
does

6959.46 --> 6964.44
get in

6960.84 --> 6967.56
then they roll out crazy ideas and

6964.44 --> 6969.9
ideologies and shitty plants that to

6967.56 --> 6971.820000000001
literally turn everything off and start

6969.9 --> 6974.04
starving their people it's What

6971.82 --> 6977.88
communists do

6974.04 --> 6981.6
they turn everything off and then make

6977.88 --> 6983.52
you starve that's what they do it's what

6981.6 --> 6986.400000000001
they always do it's what they've always

6983.52 --> 6989.88
done is what they always will do

6986.4 --> 6995.599999999999
that's why communism

6989.88 --> 6995.6
should be extinguished from this realm

6995.88 --> 7001.46
because nothing good ever comes out of

6998.88 --> 7004.28
it ever

7001.46 --> 7007.82
all the good that is claimed to come out

7004.28 --> 7009.98
of it is basically just the people

7007.82 --> 7012.259999999999
trying to survive through it through

7009.98 --> 7015.199
their inherent abilities that are like

7012.26 --> 7016.76
genetic or whatever their culture and

7015.199 --> 7019.82
what's left of it

7016.76 --> 7023.659000000001
after everything's been destroyed

7019.82 --> 7025.94
and then oh look a communist too they're

7023.659 --> 7030.5
still working through no it's been

7025.94 --> 7034.699
nothing but a burden it only destroys

7030.5 --> 7038.199
they get in they take over

7034.699 --> 7038.199
then they like

7038.3 --> 7043.9400000000005
fortify themselves

7041.119 --> 7046.159
politically psychologically

7043.94 --> 7049.098999999999
and through the justice system and then

7046.159 --> 7051.5
they start starving the people they

7049.099 --> 7053.9800000000005
start turning off facilities they start

7051.5 --> 7057.38
turning off power turning off Logistics

7053.98 --> 7060.32
this is historical

7057.38 --> 7062.42
look at the Soviet Union this is what

7060.32 --> 7065.54
they did

7062.42 --> 7068.2390000000005
turn everything off so everybody becomes

7065.54 --> 7070.94
so starved they will become your willing

7068.239 --> 7076.54
slaves because they have no choice it's

7070.94 --> 7076.54
feudalism communism is Neo feudalism

7080.54 --> 7086.0
right while the political Elite like

7083.119 --> 7089.0599999999995
start engorging themselves on infinite

7086.0 --> 7091.4
riches that they literally looted from

7089.06 --> 7094.88
the people that they are starving it's

7091.4 --> 7097.638999999999
what communism is everywhere

7094.88 --> 7099.32
it's what it always does it's what it

7097.639 --> 7101.119
always will do and that's what's

7099.32 --> 7102.38
happening in right now in the western

7101.119 --> 7106.759999999999
world

7102.38 --> 7109.400000000001
England the Netherlands Germany France

7106.76 --> 7111.679
America to some degree but it's

7109.4 --> 7113.96
different

7111.679 --> 7116.26
especially Europe is getting exactly

7113.96 --> 7116.26
this

7119.36 --> 7125.0599999999995
right

7121.639 --> 7128.42
and yeah the the whole green movement

7125.06 --> 7130.6990000000005
was great and even now it's still

7128.42 --> 7133.58
important the problem is is that it's

7130.699 --> 7136.82
been politically infected with Banker

7133.58 --> 7138.0199999999995
scams like CO2 is an environmental

7136.82 --> 7140.96
problem

7142.239 --> 7148.759999999999

7152.239 --> 7157.459999999999
hate taking care of Nature and

7154.4 --> 7160.339999999999
environmentalism and Care in general

7157.46 --> 7161.78
they've infiltrated it and they're

7160.34 --> 7164.8
destroying it

communism infiltrated the green movement

7164.8 --> 7170.06
taking it over

7167.54 --> 7172.699
partially you can't look if people just

7170.06 --> 7175.280000000001
do it themselves Grassroots you can't

7172.699 --> 7178.58
take that over but big organizations

7175.28 --> 7181.5199999999995
they can take over and then use it the

7178.58 --> 7183.38
rollout propaganda and Banker schemes

7232.219 --> 7235.88
about Marxist communism which is

7234.26 --> 7238.400000000001
political communism

7235.88 --> 7241.159000000001
which is reversed world

7238.4 --> 7243.259999999999
communism where everything becomes lies

7241.159 --> 7245.839999999999
and you just they just destroy your mind

7243.26 --> 7248.179
to turn you into a Slave

7245.84 --> 7249.8
that doesn't work directly then they try

your roots

7252.08 --> 7258.5

7254.06 --> 7260.84
about political Marxist communism is to

that's the communism I'm talking about

7266.06 --> 7272.56
organizing

7267.92 --> 7272.56
is not really communism

7274.52 --> 7280.6990000000005
a commune is not really communism like

7278.119 --> 7283.04
that it's not organized communism it's

7280.699 --> 7285.86
not political communism it's not Marxist

it's just people working together

it's not barbaric yeah it is barbaric

7906.98 --> 7912.379999999999
it's but it's genuinely insane

that's like the spirit

7912.38 --> 7916.52
just giving up so badly that demon just

7915.08 --> 7918.92
comes in and it's just like you're

7916.52 --> 7923.080000000001
looking for a Target to kill or to

7918.92 --> 7923.08
sacrifice even that's what they do

7923.96 --> 7927.94
I've experienced what that feels like

7938.98 --> 7944.598999999999
and they'll if you're like unlucky

7942.38 --> 7945.92
they'll do it like in the middle of your

7944.599 --> 7948.139
life

7945.92 --> 7951.56
this is by the way also the same effect

7948.139 --> 7955.639
that I think that causes people that

7951.56 --> 7959.2390000000005
take ssris when they get off it

7955.639 --> 7961.88
this is exactly what happens

7959.239 --> 7963.44
they're like they lose it their Spirits

7961.88 --> 7964.76
just

7963.44 --> 7967.5199999999995
gone

7964.76 --> 7968.54
and then the demons just like ah what do

7967.52 --> 7969.679
we got here

7968.54 --> 7972.619
okay

7969.679 --> 7975.679
how do I kill all of these people and

7972.619 --> 7978.079
including like your own baby and your

7975.679 --> 7980.719
wife and your dog

7978.079 --> 7983.119
and they'll just do that and then as

7980.719 --> 7985.699
soon as you've done it you'll wake up

7983.119 --> 7988.96
and then when you realize what's

7985.699 --> 7988.96
happened probably kill yourself

7990.56 --> 7993.88
it sounds like that

8003.58 --> 8007.0289999999995
[Music]

8008.02 --> 8013.84
that's by the way very horrific that

that actually does happen out there

I mean there's like some serious horror

8016.179 --> 8020.1990000000005
stories

8018.04 --> 8021.699
that

8020.199 --> 8025.598999999999
that

8021.699 --> 8029.138999999999
like police officers then have to like

8025.599 --> 8031.360000000001
report and all that nightmares

8029.139 --> 8033.6990000000005
because it just happened sometimes it

8031.36 --> 8036.219
like and you never really expect it

8033.699 --> 8037.78
because the people that do that are like

8036.219 --> 8041.199
usually

8037.78 --> 8043.719
like very normal sensible people and

8041.199 --> 8045.219
then yeah they get depressed or

8043.719 --> 8046.719
something and they just listen to

8045.219 --> 8049.54
doctors too much and they don't

8046.719 --> 8052.78
communicate enough they keep it in take

8049.54 --> 8054.88
that drug [ __ ] and then someday like for

8052.78 --> 8057.759999999999
whatever reason forget it or don't take

8054.88 --> 8061.42
it anymore and then

8057.76 --> 8065.42
suddenly certainly like it's all gone

8061.42 --> 8070.659
it's just a slaughterhouse

[Music]

8080.54 --> 8084.409
[Music]

8098.02 --> 8104.139
right but what that effectively is to me

8100.719 --> 8106.42
is a demon possesses a person because of

8104.139 --> 8109.0
their fundamentals weakness they have no

8106.42 --> 8111.88
more control at all they surrender to

8109.0 --> 8113.44
whatever possesses whatever comes by to

8111.88 --> 8115.659000000001
distract them

8113.44 --> 8119.32
and that can be a demon that's like

8115.659 --> 8120.699
literally just ooh quickly what can I

8119.32 --> 8123.34
sacrifice

8120.699 --> 8126.219
is just kill kill kill kill kill kill

8123.34 --> 8129.82
but like a sacrifice and then as soon

8126.219 --> 8132.639
it's like they a demon comes to claim

8129.82 --> 8135.579
sacrifices it does it for you it comes

8132.639 --> 8137.679
in you you just you're not there you

8135.579 --> 8139.54
Slaughter and then when it's done like

8137.679 --> 8141.52
Ah that's enough and then it leaves

8139.54 --> 8144.36
again and then you're waking up to what

8141.52 --> 8144.360000000001
the [ __ ] just happened

8146.28 --> 8153.179
or if it's that thorough then the demon

8149.5 --> 8153.179
might even make you kill yourself too

8154.54 --> 8158.92
it's pretty [ __ ] up

8156.52 --> 8163.179
don't take ssris

8158.92 --> 8166.92
and if you feel bad don't hide it all

8163.179 --> 8166.92
from the entire world

8206.979 --> 8210.719
this is getting really dark now

8212.019 --> 8217.359
this all started with there we go again

8214.899 --> 8220.779999999999
losing our teddy bear

8217.359 --> 8223.12
from her very unsim yeah and sympathetic

8220.78 --> 8226.380000000001
mother that would got really freaking

8223.12 --> 8226.380000000001
dark [ __ ]

8236.5 --> 8242.32
your fault Nana really

8239.859 --> 8244.66
maybe a little but I think you just

8242.32 --> 8247.679
needed to face it and and then you

8244.66 --> 8247.679
shared it and that's cool

8247.96 --> 8252.639
I do that too sometimes it's just like

8250.24 --> 8254.38
people and then suddenly it's like oh

8252.639 --> 8256.539999999999
something from the past and making me

8254.38 --> 8258.279999999999
emotional I gotta share it like even if

8256.54 --> 8260.139000000001
they don't really know all that much

8258.28 --> 8261.28
about you

8260.139 --> 8265.119999999999
you know

8261.28 --> 8269.099
there's a need for that and it's good

8265.12 --> 8269.099
to face what you got inside

[Music]

8286.84 --> 8292.42
yeah dude you see that like I

8290.32 --> 8294.359
when I was 17

8292.42 --> 8298.059
my

8294.359 --> 8302.04
uh therapist which I did actually visit

8298.059 --> 8303.58
back then also tried to give me that

8302.04 --> 8305.800000000001
antipsychotic

8303.58 --> 8308.859
and he really like insisted for a while

8305.8 --> 8311.08
but I adamantly like refused it

8308.859 --> 8314.74
the only reason I even kept tolerating

8311.08 --> 8317.019
it is because I really needed to talk

8314.74 --> 8321.46
and express myself because my parents

8317.019 --> 8325.66
were constantly fighting oh goody

8321.46 --> 8329.38
oh [ __ ] goody and I was really

8325.66 --> 8331.66
punishing on me being an empath

8329.38 --> 8336.16
not even being able to connect anymore

8331.66 --> 8338.979
your parents actually using you

8336.16 --> 8341.979
As Weapons against each other without

8338.979 --> 8346.96
you even realizing it that sort of [ __ ]

8341.979 --> 8349.779999999999
terrible so I just really needed that

8346.96 --> 8352.178999999998
psychologist to talk to but they were

8349.78 --> 8356.26
trying to push freaking antipsychotics

8352.179 --> 8359.439
on me and I was like never

8356.26 --> 8361.66
I'd rather die

8359.439 --> 8364.24
I'd rather like

8361.66 --> 8366.519
collapse in on myself and get an

8364.24 --> 8368.8
aneurysm and die that way from Pure

8366.519 --> 8371.74
stress of whatever I'm going to be

8368.8 --> 8374.639
subjected to but I will not take that

8371.74 --> 8374.639
ever

8376.66 --> 8380.74
and I never have I've never taken real

8378.939 --> 8383.880000000001
antidepressants I've never taken

8380.74 --> 8383.88
antipsychotics ever

8388.54 --> 8394.320000000002
my my nephew did

8391.06 --> 8394.32
he killed himself

8394.899 --> 8402.84
my mother did she blowed it up like a

8398.56 --> 8402.84
troll and then died from cancer

8404.02 --> 8408.479000000001
those are the two people in my family I

8406.899 --> 8411.64
know took

8408.479 --> 8414.779999999999
antidepressant medication

8411.64 --> 8414.779999999999

8430.12 --> 8435.460000000001
sorry to hear that yeah it's a long time

8433.479 --> 8437.46
ago

8435.46 --> 8439.919999999998
foreign

8437.46 --> 8443.339999999998
my nephew wasn't like

8439.92 --> 8443.34
2010 I think

8445.96 --> 8451.779999999999
talking about which I had never I had a

8449.319 --> 8453.039999999999
very interesting inner experience

8451.78 --> 8456.28
yesterday

8453.04 --> 8459.28
reflecting upon my grandmother

8456.28 --> 8461.26
also death by the way

8459.28 --> 8464.34
I had a lot of family die in a very

8461.26 --> 8464.34
short time

8464.68 --> 8467.34
my mother

8467.52 --> 8472.979000000001
my nephew

8469.96 --> 8472.979
my grandmother

8475.479 --> 8481.599999999999
but yeah my grandmother was

8477.96 --> 8483.519999999999
a really bizarre person compared to

8481.6 --> 8485.319
everybody else I think my mother was

8483.52 --> 8487.359
like an empath

8485.319 --> 8490.18
and she had just like completely

8487.359 --> 8492.54
fortified herself all her life I mean

8490.18 --> 8494.92
she basically went through

8492.54 --> 8496.300000000001
starvation times in her Youth and all

8494.92 --> 8498.58
that

8496.3 --> 8501.759999999998
and she was

8498.58 --> 8505.359
like very spiritually aware but

8501.76 --> 8508.380000000001
extremely conservative and non-liberal

8505.359 --> 8511.24
so yeah she was like

8508.38 --> 8513.099999999999
and super non-liberal that was very

8511.24 --> 8515.68
modest that was in the middle of a

8513.1 --> 8519.16
liberal family pretty much

8515.68 --> 8521.439
was really tough on her and like this is

8519.16 --> 8524.68
this was really a source of agitation

8521.439 --> 8526.6
for me is that I felt that

8524.68 --> 8528.76
the people in my family just didn't

8526.6 --> 8530.74
respect her they thought that she was

8528.76 --> 8533.62
neurotic about things and she just

8530.74 --> 8535.84
always tried to resist

8533.62 --> 8539.02
but she was highly

8535.84 --> 8541.0
like down said they downplayed her when

8539.02 --> 8543.58
I thought that my grandmother was

8541.0 --> 8547.68
actually really sharp

8543.58 --> 8547.68
very careful with her speech

8547.72 --> 8552.399
and I let her know I yeah I definitely

8550.359 --> 8554.439
let her know and I also basically told

8552.399 --> 8556.18
her something that is quite surreal that

8554.439 --> 8559.06
I actually got to tell her that before

8556.18 --> 8562.06
she died and that is that I told her

8559.06 --> 8564.399
after you die it's very likely you'll be

8562.06 --> 8567.58
suspended in a dream that will just last

8564.399 --> 8570.22
forever and I want you to know that you

8567.58 --> 8573.1
can ride with me

8570.22 --> 8575.679999999998
I will do my best to make it

8573.1 --> 8577.6
good for you and then you can ride with

8575.68 --> 8581.1
me after death

8577.6 --> 8581.1
and I think that she is

8581.2 --> 8583.68
because

8585.399 --> 8589.599999999999
it's not even about oh she pops up in my

8587.979 --> 8592.84
mind and just says something no it's

8589.6 --> 8596.26
just literally her existing just her

8592.84 --> 8598.24
existing with her stats not saying

8596.26 --> 8601.24
anything and looking at me in very

8598.24 --> 8604.3
specific ways that's like

8601.24 --> 8607.479
so much compacted information that only

8604.3 --> 8610.599999999999
my spirit can attune to because it's a

8607.479 --> 8613.26
family bond thing that's just surreal

8610.6 --> 8613.26
and

8613.6 --> 8619.42
the more time passes the more I realize

8616.06 --> 8622.359
what a special lady she really was and

8619.42 --> 8625.3
what kind of freaky [ __ ] she must have

8622.359 --> 8627.04
seen and like including like spiritual

8625.3 --> 8629.74
things

8627.04 --> 8634.02
like people getting possessed and like

8629.74 --> 8634.02
acting like completely insane and

8634.72 --> 8637.56
ah

8638.319 --> 8642.479
but she did live incredibly long

8646.859 --> 8653.399000000001
97 I think whoa that's like the same as

8650.56 --> 8653.399
the queen isn't it

8657.28 --> 8662.380000000001
yeah I think she like was 97 in the end

8660.34 --> 8664.74
pretty amazing

8662.38 --> 8664.74
anyway

8668.26 --> 8674.04
what the [ __ ] are you talking about

8671.439 --> 8674.04

8674.439 --> 8678.960000000001
sorry if I'm not following chat too

8676.479 --> 8678.96
detailed

8679.899 --> 8684.64
being first on the scene yeah I agree

8682.12 --> 8686.68
early bird is a good name that's why I

8684.64 --> 8688.0
chose it I chose it very carefully I

8686.68 --> 8692.439
chose it

8688.0 --> 8694.18
attuned to my abilities see I'm not just

8692.439 --> 8697.24
here as a person

8694.18 --> 8701.5
I'm also representative of my specific

8697.24 --> 8703.979
spiritual abilities and what I do

8701.5 --> 8703.979
anyway

8707.1 --> 8712.78
God you guys are talking hard

8710.68 --> 8713.979000000001
a lot all of a sudden

8712.78 --> 8719.26
[Music]

8713.979 --> 8719.26
to give them a right accessorize

8728.02 --> 8732.34
wow

8730.3 --> 8733.899
that's pretty epic by the way at least

8732.34 --> 8737.1

8733.899 --> 8741.42
so lucky

8737.1 --> 8741.42
younger brother holy [ __ ]

8742.18 --> 8747.64
no my my parents would never force me to

8745.0 --> 8750.939
take anything also because I would

8747.64 --> 8752.979
become like very seriously vicious I

8750.939 --> 8755.62
would like almost start to like threaten

8752.979 --> 8757.359999999999
their lives and this is like when I was

8755.62 --> 8759.04
very little

8757.36 --> 8763.18
[Music]

8759.04 --> 8765.819000000001
I would be like no I need time to

8763.18 --> 8766.6
process things you cannot force me to do

8765.819 --> 8770.64
things

8766.6 --> 8770.640000000001
or I will turn demonic

8770.74 --> 8778.24
you cannot force me yeah my parents

8774.88 --> 8781.599999999999
could not force me

8778.24 --> 8783.899
we negotiated because I gave them no

8781.6 --> 8783.899000000001
choice

8792.28 --> 8797.74
then they might have been able to force

8795.1 --> 8800.92
me but then they would have also taken

8797.74 --> 8805.14
what comes after that and they wouldn't

8800.92 --> 8805.14
I think I scared them too much maybe

8807.22 --> 8812.858999999999
right and I would much rather just use

8810.52 --> 8815.140000000001
all my refined abilities to help them

8812.859 --> 8816.7
out and to share what I was seeing and

8815.14 --> 8819.46
just what I was seeing about the future

8816.7 --> 8822.04
and about other people I would be their

8819.46 --> 8823.119999999999
sensor like they would come to me as a

8822.04 --> 8827.02
little kid

8823.12 --> 8829.54
what do you feel about that person

8827.02 --> 8831.899000000001

called John

that's insane

8959.56 --> 8964.119999999999
although I do not know why the hell a

8962.26 --> 8966.399
child would be sent to a therapist

8964.12 --> 8968.800000000001
before yeah

8966.399 --> 8970.24
I don't know I would never actually

8968.8 --> 8972.819
never

8970.24 --> 8976.66
send my kid to a therapist

8972.819 --> 8980.38
I would never do that why because I can

8976.66 --> 8983.2
be a therapist I can I know I can

8980.38 --> 8985.3
despite everything despite the way I do

8983.2 --> 8987.460000000001
things I could do that and I will do

8985.3 --> 8991.14
that and it will do it great I will do

8987.46 --> 8991.14
it like their personal shaman

8993.76 --> 8996.76
because yeah it's gonna be my kid of

8995.56 --> 8999.58
course

8996.76 --> 9002.7
but I wouldn't even consider going to a

8999.58 --> 9005.34
therapist like I will never go to a

9002.7 --> 9006.78
therapist now I will go to somebody to

9005.34 --> 9009.78
talk to

9006.78 --> 9013.859
and then I will do the therapist part

9009.78 --> 9016.74
because I don't need any other out there

9013.859 --> 9021.380000000001
I've become my own therapist and I'm

9016.74 --> 9021.38
very efficient at it I'd say

9027.18 --> 9031.979000000001
there's no better Protective Service and

9029.1 --> 9034.880000000001
therapists than the parents yeah if well

9031.979 --> 9034.88
if you're up to it

9035.06 --> 9038.24
go away

9052.88 --> 9059.179999999998

9056.34 --> 9059.18
even what that is

9059.76 --> 9065.04
I just I don't

9061.74 --> 9067.319
it's if it's big Pharma originated then

9065.04 --> 9070.080000000002
just don't take it if it's not like oh

9067.319 --> 9072.3
look this is a direct plant extract and

9070.08 --> 9073.92
that's it like that is what it is just

9072.3 --> 9076.74
this plant

9073.92 --> 9079.5
if some supposed medicine or capsule

9076.74 --> 9082.1
doesn't just have literally the name of

9079.5 --> 9087.859
the plant that it is comprised of on it

9082.1 --> 9087.859
I would never even consider taking it

9088.74 --> 9091.28
ever

9095.7 --> 9102.18

9098.7 --> 9106.52

parents are pulling their children good

9191.1 --> 9197.220000000001
they should and that school should go

9194.399 --> 9200.039999999999
bust and that management should have be

9197.22 --> 9203.099999999999
fired and have a permanent mark on their

9200.04 --> 9206.819000000001
record so that every school from then on

9203.1 --> 9209.52
will know this teacher is a freak

9206.819 --> 9212.16
he will allow

9209.52 --> 9214.800000000001
really creepy people for political

9212.16 --> 9219.3
reasons that are Marxist in origin into

9214.8 --> 9222.019999999999
the school never hire him again that's

9219.3 --> 9222.019999999999
what should happen

9228.3 --> 9239.759999999998
[Music]

9237.18 --> 9241.2
something about the dress code

9239.76 --> 9244.02
no

9241.2 --> 9246.12
what the f like [ __ ] the dress code it's

9244.02 --> 9250.979000000001
like don't allow people

9246.12 --> 9252.1
that display sexually deranged actions

9250.979 --> 9255.458999999999
that simple

9252.1 --> 9255.459
[Music]

9256.34 --> 9263.66
no sexual derangement

9259.92 --> 9270.18
huge prosthetic breasts fall under

9263.66 --> 9270.18
sexually deranged actions done

9285.96 --> 9290.938999999998
done right so no lingerie

9288.78 --> 9293.12
no Prosthetics

9290.939 --> 9297.24
no freaking

9293.12 --> 9299.939
beards and makeup like ladies none of

9297.24 --> 9303.14
that crap dude if it were up to me I'd

9299.939 --> 9305.76
say no neon colors ever

9303.14 --> 9307.74
right but then again I'm really

9305.76 --> 9309.84
old-fashioned like that and I hate neon

9307.74 --> 9312.24
colors so

9309.84 --> 9315.24
it's not that difficult

9312.24 --> 9318.78
it's just don't hire anybody that is

9315.24 --> 9321.72
sexually deranged and overt about it

9318.78 --> 9325.58
whether it be verbal

9321.72 --> 9329.699999999999
their sexual derangement or

9325.58 --> 9331.62
cosmetic sexual derangement just no no

9329.7 --> 9334.399000000001
sexual derangement

9331.62 --> 9334.399000000001
[ __ ] off

9342.899 --> 9348.0
can you post a pic no you're gonna have

9344.939 --> 9352.04
to find it yourself I will not have a

9348.0 --> 9352.04
pic posted here about that

9354.72 --> 9360.019999999999
and no link either

9356.64 --> 9360.019999999999
just find it yourself

9380.22 --> 9383.779999999999
tone down the toxic

9385.64 --> 9391.279999999999
okay that is hilarious Susie if that's

9388.56 --> 9391.279999999999
true then

9391.92 --> 9396.359
then that whole school is already

9394.02 --> 9399.84
completely [ __ ] I mean if he's doing

9396.359 --> 9404.399000000001
it out of a protest because everybody's

9399.84 --> 9406.92
sjw pieces of [ __ ] of the teachers

9404.399 --> 9410.64
well then I get it

9406.92 --> 9413.460000000001
then he just basically lit the fuse

9410.64 --> 9414.84
in the powder keg

9413.46 --> 9417.0
cool

9414.84 --> 9420.02
then probably most of those teachers

9417.0 --> 9420.02
should be fired

9420.12 --> 9428.640000000001
if you use the word toxic masculinity

9424.64 --> 9429.599999999999
you should be fired if you ever use that

9428.64 --> 9432.539999999999
ever

9429.6 --> 9434.939
just one time

9432.54 --> 9439.560000000001
one time Audible

9434.939 --> 9442.979000000001
or readable you should be fired

9439.56 --> 9446.22
anybody that uses that word ever should

9442.979 --> 9449.039999999999
be fired and not be allowed in schools

9446.22 --> 9454.26
that sort of talking

9449.04 --> 9458.34
should be you're fired immediately

9454.26 --> 9462.479
no you're about toxic masculinity or

9458.34 --> 9466.2
or non-binary gender blah blah blah

9462.479 --> 9468.319
fired you're fired get the [ __ ] out of

9466.2 --> 9468.319000000001
here

9469.62 --> 9479.410000000002
[Music]

9481.79 --> 9486.659000000001
[Music]

9493.08 --> 9499.56
I mean kids are gonna bring up that

9495.12 --> 9501.899000000001
garbage already right some of them

9499.56 --> 9504.6
they might yeah

9501.899 --> 9506.699999999999
that's already problematic enough that

9504.6 --> 9509.76
children will probably bring up the

9506.7 --> 9511.92
toxic masculinity garbage and non-gender

9509.76 --> 9514.979
blah blah blah blah blah that's a

9511.92 --> 9517.5
problem for teachers

9514.979 --> 9520.56
that it should be their problem and it

9517.5 --> 9523.1
should not be their thing

9520.56 --> 9523.1
ever

9524.58 --> 9529.979
it should be their problem to deal with

9527.28 --> 9533.78
it against it

9529.979 --> 9537.5
no teacher should ever be into that ever

9533.78 --> 9537.5
on any school

9543.09 --> 9546.219000000001
[Music]

9574.08 --> 9576.92
right

9577.74 --> 9580.889
[Music]

9583.14 --> 9589.38
yeah that yeah correct

9585.72 --> 9592.619999999999
PGC net and here we go again what would

9589.38 --> 9594.599999999999
have been better is if he that teacher

9592.62 --> 9595.5
that did that crazy prosthetic breast

9594.6 --> 9598.2
thing

9595.5 --> 9602.04
if he'd literally made a project out of

9598.2 --> 9606.12
it to literally go to all the parents

9602.04 --> 9608.460000000001
and inform them about the culture that

9606.12 --> 9610.640000000001
is at that school and that he is getting

9608.46 --> 9613.14
attacked for being

9610.64 --> 9615.96
toxic masculine

9613.14 --> 9617.58
right you should have done that and then

9615.96 --> 9620.699999999999
basically tried to get the school

9617.58 --> 9622.859
together to act against that maybe he

9620.7 --> 9625.28
did though and everybody ignored him

9622.859 --> 9627.24
could be two I mean we're talking about

9625.28 --> 9631.92
Americans here

9627.24 --> 9634.14
the most negligent lazy ass [ __ ] in

9631.92 --> 9637.14
the [ __ ] world and it's not a joke

9634.14 --> 9640.74
and it's not an exaggeration they are

9637.14 --> 9642.319
they're unbelievably negligent with

9640.74 --> 9645.619999999999
these types of things

9642.319 --> 9645.619999999999
Canadians okay

9649.68 --> 9654.66
I don't know then I don't know what the

9652.02 --> 9657.439
[ __ ] Canadians are they're flappy heads

9654.66 --> 9657.439
and all that [ __ ]

9658.14 --> 9661.099999999999
but uh

9661.76 --> 9667.74
negligence may have put him to do that

9664.859 --> 9669.78
to kind of like Force action but if he

9667.74 --> 9671.46
hadn't actually

9669.78 --> 9674.16
if he hadn't

9671.46 --> 9676.099999999999
tried that before and just went straight

9674.16 --> 9678.359
with the prosthetic breast as some

9676.1 --> 9679.74
controversial protests yeah that is

9678.359 --> 9682.380000000001
pretty [ __ ]

9679.74 --> 9686.34
I mean he should definitely have

9682.38 --> 9690.74
gone and talked to the parents first

9686.34 --> 9690.74
about what is going on in school

9691.14 --> 9698.34
I mean he could have also just kind of

9694.92 --> 9701.7
yeah stepped away from the job

9698.34 --> 9705.66
in protest but maybe he was like kind of

9701.7 --> 9708.560000000001
in real bad need of work so

9705.66 --> 9708.56
uh

9710.819 --> 9715.92
right but as long as he doesn't actually

9713.399 --> 9717.84
believe that that is normal and that if

9715.92 --> 9719.52
he just did it out of protest it's kind

9717.84 --> 9722.960000000001
of an ass

9719.52 --> 9722.960000000001
thing to do but

9724.439 --> 9728.76
at least he's not one of the people that

9726.78 --> 9732.08
actually wants children to get used to

9728.76 --> 9735.54
that [ __ ] and that is a bit of a concern

9732.08 --> 9737.7
consolidation prize then I guess

9735.54 --> 9740.1
right I'm gonna round out the show wow

9737.7 --> 9743.66
