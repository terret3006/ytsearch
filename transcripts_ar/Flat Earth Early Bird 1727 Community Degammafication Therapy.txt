croissant Rola which is staying really

223.0 --> 229.76
good by the

225.0 --> 233.72
way like it's not going to Mush as

229.76 --> 238.84
quickly as it was in the middle of the

233.72 --> 241.68
summer so that's good and a Gusto just

238.84 --> 241.68
in case

242.28 --> 245.68
don't know if I'm going to take that

258.919 --> 268.15999999999997
yet right so yeah don't have exact don't

263.32 --> 268.15999999999997
have a subject in mind at

268.6 --> 273.32000000000005
mind

271.16 --> 276.28000000000003
pretty good

273.32 --> 279.28
rest ow Benjamin show yesterday was

276.28 --> 279.28
great

281.96 --> 288.68
hilarious apparently out there Russell

284.639 --> 290.88
Brand is now getting it suddenly being

288.68 --> 296.039
debanked and all that

290.88 --> 296.039
[ __ ] for just I don't want to get into

298.56 --> 301.56
it

302.44 --> 308.28
it's from my perspective it's like

305.36 --> 313.47900000000004
Brotherhood of grifter

308.28 --> 318.039
[ __ ] like I don't know if he like

313.479 --> 320.59999999999997
nah it's just the to keep him in like oh

318.039 --> 322.56
he's still prominent see he's still

320.6 --> 325.56
prominent they're doing

322.56 --> 328.44
this something like that I I just don't

325.56 --> 331.36
really care more than that oh is it all

328.44 --> 334.36
for the alternative me yeah oh is it

331.36 --> 334.36
everywhere

336.8 --> 340.319
je uh let's

343.919 --> 350.68
see oh yeah I heard that apparently

347.44 --> 351.52
Poland like pull out of their support

350.68 --> 354.0
for

351.52 --> 357.639
Ukraine which is

354.0 --> 360.319
really good in my

357.639 --> 362.88
opinion don't know the exact details of

360.319 --> 365.40000000000003
it but at least that means like there's

362.88 --> 368.44
a chance that they're just going to stop

365.4 --> 372.31899999999996
because this entire thing is just so

368.44 --> 377.039
[ __ ] what they're doing out

372.319 --> 380.199
there and yeah our deep state is making

377.039 --> 382.8
it even worse by just sending them

380.199 --> 384.599
support continually even though nobody

382.8 --> 387.28000000000003
here really wants

384.599 --> 390.639
to they're doing it with our tax money

387.28 --> 392.79999999999995
so yeah I'm kind of glad

390.639 --> 395.16
countries are pulling

392.8 --> 398.039
out cuz then there's a bigger chance

395.16 --> 398.03900000000004
it'll just

400.24 --> 406.56
stop

402.479 --> 406.56
anyway that's going on out

408.16 --> 411.16
there

418.4 --> 421.4
uh

429.4 --> 435.79999999999995
wow yeah that's pretty much it what did

432.52 --> 435.79999999999995
ow Benjamin talk about

445.25 --> 452.319
[Music]

448.319 --> 456.52000000000004
yesterday yeah Nathan was or Nathan Owen

456.52 --> 463.919
lot yeah was a I don't remember damn it

460.919 --> 463.919

through is anybody going to show up in

469.24 --> 471.52
the

472.96 --> 480.07
chat feel kind of

476.039 --> 482.0
stuck I'll figure it out I mean but

480.07 --> 484.36
[Music]

482.0 --> 486.68
uh right I'll just start chowing down on

484.36 --> 489.91900000000004
this Illuminati kasan because I am

486.68 --> 494.84000000000003
really hungry so

489.919 --> 494.84
cheers maybe that'll help me focus a bit

508.24 --> 511.24
more

517.73 --> 520.889
[Music]

538.2 --> 541.2
for

546.51 --> 549.6899999999999
[Music]

560.16 --> 564.519
anyway

561.959 --> 568.279
yeah even though I don't really have

564.519 --> 571.6
anything to talk about right now I do

568.279 --> 571.6
feel like I rest St a

574.8 --> 581.0
lot but yeah it is a like the weather

578.48 --> 582.44
transition and all that I'm just going

581.0 --> 587.0
to have to get used to that it's going

582.44 --> 587.0
to be Autumn now with more rain and all

598.12 --> 601.12
that

602.24 --> 606.839
uh let's

603.68 --> 606.8389999999999
see what

618.8 --> 622.959
else right yeah I think I could talk

621.44 --> 626.8800000000001
about

622.959 --> 631.16
something I'm I'm just taking notice

626.88 --> 632.16
that there's like more for activity now

631.16 --> 634.519
in

632.16 --> 636.8389999999999
general I'm noticing

634.519 --> 640.36
so that comes with the mood shift as

636.839 --> 643.639
well yeah I guess I should I did say it

640.36 --> 645.839
like yesterday and the day before too I

643.639 --> 651.0
think don't know if I said it on my own

645.839 --> 651.0
show but it is like the the troll

651.48 --> 656.639
season right just like in Autumn time

655.12 --> 659.04
what typically happens is that the

656.639 --> 660.36
fungus suddenly strikes right the

659.04 --> 663.12
mushrooms

660.36 --> 666.9590000000001
come well that's that kind of happens

663.12 --> 669.6
socially with gamma so it's like

666.959 --> 672.3599999999999
a after the

669.6 --> 675.24
summer when everybody kind of like all

672.36 --> 677.6
the alphas and everybody just kind of

675.24 --> 679.2
like their Buzz starts to run out from

677.6 --> 683.0790000000001
the

679.2 --> 685.2
summer then gamas feel like all the

683.079 --> 687.76
people that they are envious

685.2 --> 690.5600000000001
towards on average not everybody

687.76 --> 694.68
literally but on average the energy

690.56 --> 697.56
decreases and then they all feel like oh

694.68 --> 698.92
they're finally dying now is my my time

697.56 --> 701.8
to

698.92 --> 707.4799999999999
strike so there's a lot of troll videos

701.8 --> 707.4799999999999
going around now for about me but also

708.68 --> 712.04
everybody and that and that happens

710.88 --> 715.88
every

712.04 --> 718.04
year like at the moment that like summer

715.88 --> 719.72
really starts to end then they all start

718.04 --> 723.12
to like

719.72 --> 725.6
Bloom up get more active try to get more

723.12 --> 725.6
in your

726.01 --> 731.0
[Music]

728.24 --> 734.0790000000001
face I'd actually be expecting more

731.0 --> 737.32
trolls to show up but thus far like

734.079 --> 740.399
there hasn't been that many trolls on my

737.32 --> 742.5600000000001
channel like on in the chat I mean there

740.399 --> 743.839
has been days in the Summer where it was

742.56 --> 747.199
like quite a

743.839 --> 749.839
lot but recently not so much so that

747.199 --> 751.3199999999999
that is kind of odd

749.839 --> 754.8800000000001
I would expect

751.32 --> 757.12
more hey Aries 106 First in chat good to

754.88 --> 757.12
see

762.24 --> 768.279
you hello

764.68 --> 768.279
o good to see

773.59 --> 776.789
[Music]

777.839 --> 780.839
you

789.74 --> 792.94
[Music]

797.399 --> 802.92
Nathan is having very short shows

800.0 --> 805.6
although to be fair yesterday was like a

802.92 --> 807.56
a pretty long normal

805.6 --> 811.0400000000001
show but I

807.56 --> 813.6389999999999
mean n rounded out the after show after

811.04 --> 813.639
like 7

815.639 --> 821.82
minutes so it's been kind of a void over

818.72 --> 825.029
at fed after after

821.82 --> 825.029
[Music]

833.22 --> 836.269
[Music]

837.759 --> 840.759
show

844.44 --> 850.6
also a funny

846.16 --> 854.68
detail I haven't been using my alarm

850.6 --> 856.9590000000001
clock since I got like this new

854.68 --> 859.8
phone well I did use it a couple of

856.959 --> 862.399
times but then like it's so freaking

859.8 --> 866.199
dysfunctional you can't turn it off with

862.399 --> 868.519
like a click there's like only a stupid

866.199 --> 871.399
snooze button once it gets going you

868.519 --> 874.72
have have to like go into

871.399 --> 877.519
the into like the micro menu of it and

874.72 --> 880.1600000000001
basically edit out of effect of being

877.519 --> 882.5600000000001
there you so you can't just like it's

880.16 --> 885.24
it's stupid so I just like I screw it

882.56 --> 885.2399999999999
I'm not doing it

885.92 --> 892.3199999999999
anymore

887.639 --> 892.32
but yeah it's working out just

892.68 --> 902.0
fine I've been mostly on time right it's

896.44 --> 905.8800000000001
only one time last week where I was like

902.0 --> 908.959
really where I overs slapped a

905.88 --> 911.36
lot that happened like one time but the

908.959 --> 913.8389999999999
rest it's been pretty yeah pretty on

911.36 --> 917.279
time I'd say without an alarm clock so

913.839 --> 917.9300000000001
yeah I'm happy about that hey Richard G

917.279 --> 920.98
good to see

917.93 --> 920.9799999999999
[Music]

927.6 --> 930.6
you

933.79 --> 937.0
[Music]

949.94 --> 953.0490000000001
[Music]

957.6 --> 960.6
h

975.88 --> 981.36
right anyway hope you're all waking up

979.16 --> 981.36
this

986.04 --> 990.519
[Music]

987.519 --> 990.519
Friday

992.7 --> 995.839
[Music]

1008.839 --> 1013.9200000000001
anybody have anything to say anything

1011.759 --> 1016.5600000000001
you picked up

1013.92 --> 1018.639
on or is this like one of those days

1016.56 --> 1020.7199999999999
where you're all like woke up as zombie

1018.639 --> 1024.079
and it's going to take you like 2 hours

1020.72 --> 1024.079
to start looking

1029.679 --> 1036.3190000000002
straight I'm having a little bit of that

1033.4 --> 1039.439
these days it's very typical for

1036.319 --> 1040.5
Autumn then usually during winter that

1039.439 --> 1043.769
goes

1040.5 --> 1043.769
[Music]

1045.52 --> 1051.2
away I'm just at this at this point I'm

1048.72 --> 1053.88
really glad I don't drink

1051.2 --> 1058.2
anymore because like when you're a

1053.88 --> 1058.2
drinker then Autumn hits extra

1058.96 --> 1065.559
hard it's probably the reason why like

1062.4 --> 1068.48
alcohol plus Autumn tends to get people

1065.559 --> 1072.3999999999999
depressed on average even when normally

1068.48 --> 1075.44
it doesn't so then that suddenly starts

1072.4 --> 1078.24
happening and with me

1075.44 --> 1081.44
too I know we have a few years in which

1078.24 --> 1083.919
I went through Autumn and I can say

1081.44 --> 1086.159
definitely on record that Autumn is not

1083.919 --> 1088.96
like

1086.159 --> 1091.6000000000001
the it's not my moral High Point on

1088.96 --> 1096.2
average in in those

1091.6 --> 1096.1999999999998
years but I'm not having those issues

1096.32 --> 1101.96
now I am getting a bit haunted though by

1099.84 --> 1105.36
Illusions from the Dark World and [ __ ]

1101.96 --> 1109.08
but I mean yeah that's always

1105.36 --> 1111.7199999999998
happened the alcohol would make it worse

1109.08 --> 1113.4399999999998
and yeah cannabis doesn't really seem to

1111.72 --> 1115.64
do

1113.44 --> 1119.799
that it does

1115.64 --> 1119.7990000000002
amplify though whatever you're

1120.0 --> 1124.52
in so I have to always be careful with

1124.679 --> 1130.48
it right because psychologically a

1127.96 --> 1133.88
typical problem is that people like The

1130.48 --> 1136.039
Summer's over and people like well they

1133.88 --> 1139.24
want to they want to take the summer

1136.039 --> 1142.64
with them but if that means that

1139.24 --> 1144.2
they really dislike the current time

1142.64 --> 1147.0
because of its

1144.2 --> 1150.4
difference and then try to in their mind

1147.0 --> 1152.2
escape to the summer or something there

1150.4 --> 1155.6000000000001
then it doesn't

1152.2 --> 1155.6000000000001
work now you're

1157.36 --> 1163.799
escaping if you want to take the summer

1159.72 --> 1168.32
with you that energy is just

1163.799 --> 1171.6399999999999
tougher you won't be as strong at it but

1168.32 --> 1173.6399999999999
you definitely have to face what has

1171.64 --> 1174.96
what the reality is what is happen you

1173.64 --> 1178.48
you can't

1174.96 --> 1180.72
be just dreaming about the summer and

1178.48 --> 1184.6
really disliking the

1180.72 --> 1187.3600000000001
current because then it doesn't

1184.6 --> 1190.1999999999998
work and that's actually demoralizing

1187.36 --> 1192.6789999999999
because well you're not facing things

1190.2 --> 1192.679
whatever is

1195.12 --> 1198.76
happening and thereby making it other

1197.6 --> 1200.6789999999999
people's burden

1198.76 --> 1204.8799999999999

1242.6 --> 1247.24
work at Harley-Davidson huh that's

1244.919 --> 1247.24

1248.88 --> 1252.3300000000002
[Music]

1250.559 --> 1255.45
cool

1252.33 --> 1255.4499999999998
[Music]

1257.12 --> 1260.12
h

1275.4 --> 1280.72
by the way I

1277.159 --> 1284.44
am continuing watching that Belgium

1280.72 --> 1284.44
detective series

1284.72 --> 1289.919
vza and I'm really liking it and it's

1288.559 --> 1292.32
like totally

1289.919 --> 1294.919
unexpected it is so

1292.32 --> 1297.52
Belgium and I'm like all these very

1294.919 --> 1300.8400000000001
specific Belgium

1297.52 --> 1302.12
words and it's I like that it's in it's

1300.84 --> 1306.1589999999999
almost

1302.12 --> 1308.279
like like I'm listening to Indian and so

1306.159 --> 1310.72
I can still get around with them using

1308.279 --> 1313.159
certain technical English

1310.72 --> 1316.1200000000001
words but kind of the reverse because

1313.159 --> 1319.44
like the Belgium just talk Dutch but

1316.12 --> 1322.6399999999999
they use like completely different words

1319.44 --> 1327.159
for certain things not everything but

1322.64 --> 1330.919
like things over the place and it's just

1327.159 --> 1333.919
interesting to like try to get used to

1330.919 --> 1339.0
that and also the people

1333.919 --> 1339.0
in the series are just all so very

1339.32 --> 1344.9189999999999
Dutch there's not a lot of bike thieving

1342.0 --> 1349.96
going on if you know what I mean so it's

1344.919 --> 1349.96
definitely not like a series of this era

1350.679 --> 1353.279
or

1353.4 --> 1358.1200000000001
it's maybe in some parts of Belgium it

1356.08 --> 1361.039
would still be like that it's just so

1358.12 --> 1363.1589999999999
interesting how they do things and I

1361.039 --> 1366.6
also like really

1363.159 --> 1369.2
appreciating how unbelievably forward

1366.6 --> 1373.36
and pushy this guy is

1369.2 --> 1375.559
wit and like I mean totally intrusive

1373.36 --> 1378.08
like really

1375.559 --> 1380.84
inappropriate he's like an attack dog

1378.08 --> 1383.24
that's just so [ __ ] ruthless that

1380.84 --> 1387.279
he'll just like completely watch over

1383.24 --> 1389.32
people's really terrible feelings even

1387.279 --> 1392.52
he tries not to

1389.32 --> 1394.4399999999998
but it's like multiple time there're

1392.52 --> 1397.039
just these scenes where he's like oh

1394.44 --> 1400.159
hello little kid are you this and that

1397.039 --> 1402.6
and then he's like secretly interrogate

1400.159 --> 1405.919
like asking your questions and like the

1402.6 --> 1408.6789999999999
other one is like oh my god of course he

1405.919 --> 1410.679
can't he has to do that again but it's

1408.679 --> 1413.24
kind of

1410.679 --> 1416.88
inappropriate and just the

1413.24 --> 1416.88
way that he

1419.159 --> 1424.7600000000002
like the attitude that he G presents

1422.4 --> 1427.52
himself with like during

1424.76 --> 1429.96
certain interrogation situations and

1427.52 --> 1433.8799999999999
like he really sticks up for people

1429.96 --> 1436.279
being bullied and stuff and like that's

1433.88 --> 1438.72
well very seriously acted with a lot of

1436.279 --> 1440.96
passion and stuff

1438.72 --> 1444.1200000000001
and I'm like really freaking

1440.96 --> 1446.279
appreciating this old man that is wit I

1444.12 --> 1448.08
am just like and all of those guys by

1446.279 --> 1449.76
the way it's

1448.08 --> 1453.279
hilarious

1449.76 --> 1455.279
the like all these guys are kind of

1453.279 --> 1456.88
overworked and they're all like they

1455.279 --> 1458.12
have they don't really have a life

1456.88 --> 1460.3200000000002
because they're in the police and

1458.12 --> 1462.9599999999998
they're just always freaking working and

1460.32 --> 1466.08
yeah relationship issues

1462.96 --> 1469.799
too I don't know I'm liking the series

1466.08 --> 1469.799
I'm really into it

1469.919 --> 1476.64

1472.76 --> 1476.64

feel like I'm actually a giant trapped

2110.8 --> 2117.2000000000003

2360.52 --> 2364.96
when I started talking about well the

2362.76 --> 2367.3590000000004
Dark World experiences like uh there are

2364.96 --> 2370.7200000000003
things I remember experiencing with

2367.359 --> 2372.72
people but they don't remember it oh

2370.72 --> 2375.16
that means you're what the [ __ ] this

2372.72 --> 2376.56
like oh you're oh you can't have that or

2375.16 --> 2378.319
you're

2376.56 --> 2380.56
schizophrenic what the [ __ ] does that

2378.319 --> 2380.56
even

2380.72 --> 2385.24
mean what you can't have dreams or

2383.0 --> 2385.24
you're

2385.28 --> 2388.76
schizophrenic I don't get

2393.52 --> 2398.4
it troll alert all right

2399.52 --> 2405.44
yeah but e i' appreciate if you don't

2403.56 --> 2409.599
say those types of things when I

2405.44 --> 2412.319
obviously never said I used to have

2409.599 --> 2414.96
schizophrenia I never had schizophrenia

2412.319 --> 2416.64
I've never had when you are diagnosed

2414.96 --> 2418.4
schizophrenia you get freaking

2416.64 --> 2422.359
medication for it because that means

2418.4 --> 2426.52
it's serious I've never had medication

2422.359 --> 2429.72
there were suspicions there were some

2426.52 --> 2432.04
figures that thought like oh we need to

2429.72 --> 2433.0
medicate you yeah but they because

2432.04 --> 2436.7599999999998
they're

2433.0 --> 2439.76
idiots they were not very good at their

2436.76 --> 2439.76
jobs

2440.8 --> 2448.44
okay I had psychological issues but the

2444.839 --> 2449.88
biggest problem really was more

2448.44 --> 2455.079
depression

2449.88 --> 2457.2000000000003
related and bad self-image issues that

2455.079 --> 2461.7200000000003
was the actual

2457.2 --> 2465.56
concern that made me go to them for help

2461.72 --> 2469.9199999999996
yeah not schizophrenia I don't know what

2465.56 --> 2472.0789999999997
I doing any no absolutely never never

2469.92 --> 2476.4
I've

2472.079 --> 2479.6800000000003
always been like yeah it's like just an

2476.4 --> 2482.839
adventure to me but I know how to manage

2479.68 --> 2485.96
myself I know the conse I didn't like oh

2482.839 --> 2489.7599999999998
let's take more like why do you think I

2485.96 --> 2492.48
never like after that that one

2489.76 --> 2498.0400000000004
moment why I didn't start like start

2492.48 --> 2498.04
chasing iasa or something I never

2499.24 --> 2502.24
did

2502.96 --> 2509.079
okay not like oh drugs I need more drugs

2506.839 --> 2511.96
like that and because that'll freaking

2509.079 --> 2514.52
make you schizophrenic if you have any

2511.96 --> 2518.04
Tendencies but they didn't do

2514.52 --> 2520.4
that I just had experiences that were

2518.04 --> 2523.319
quite surreal and really impressive to

2520.4 --> 2526.04
me and was really distracted a lot from

2523.319 --> 2528.64
The Real World also by

2526.04 --> 2530.44
it and none of it has anything to do

2528.64 --> 2535.0789999999997
with schizophrenia so I'd really

2530.44 --> 2535.079
appreciate if you never ever say that

2537.48 --> 2540.48
again

2622.8 --> 2627.44
thing in my

2624.76 --> 2630.119
mind it's not

2627.44 --> 2633.8
schizophrenia it's something

2630.119 --> 2636.1600000000003
else it's there magically somehow

2633.8 --> 2638.599
through Dark World Experience arguably

2636.16 --> 2644.2
through [ __ ] demons messing with my

2638.599 --> 2644.2000000000003
mind entities that were not traceably

2646.319 --> 2650.8
human a lot of it I just let it

2651.319 --> 2658.2799999999997
happen but it was on the other side not

2655.52 --> 2658.28
physically

2665.0 --> 2668.0
here

2671.68 --> 2678.3999999999996

2674.24 --> 2682.2
happened that do no I don't hear voices

2678.4 --> 2684.92
I have never heard voices even when I

2682.2 --> 2688.5589999999997

2727.76 --> 2733.079
[ __ ] annoying no I didn't hear voices

2833.16 --> 2838.44
Eevee all right but yeah I don't know I

2836.16 --> 2839.72

2838.44 --> 2842.64
simply be

2839.72 --> 2844.0
mistaken I didn't see it either I was

2842.64 --> 2847.16
looking right

2844.0 --> 2851.64
there if he wasn't

2847.16 --> 2851.64
doing that as far as I could see

2851.839 --> 2858.319
so right M

2855.599 --> 2862.04
thanks maybe if I wrot is thinking of

2858.319 --> 2864.48
another time like somewhere a few weeks

2862.04 --> 2864.48
ago or

2866.49 --> 2869.6899999999996
[Music]

2870.319 --> 2874.7599999999998
something it's clear now no it isn't

2873.079 --> 2877.319
terrett and if you think that that's

2874.76 --> 2880.48
clear I'm taking your managing wrench

2877.319 --> 2880.48
because that's terrible

2883.4 --> 2887.1600000000003
Insight she's not a

2892.4 --> 2899.359
troll she just got accused of things and

2895.68 --> 2901.96
she said no I didn't that's not a troll

2899.359 --> 2907.64
literally somebody else was there and

2901.96 --> 2907.64
confirms that it isn't happening so no

2909.64 --> 2915.7999999999997
but I made it clear now I never said

2912.8 --> 2918.319
that Eevee was a troll I specifically

2915.8 --> 2922.88
stated that she wasn't a

2918.319 --> 2922.88
troll specifically stated

2934.599 --> 2937.599
that

2945.04 --> 2952.16
you made it clear about your I st in her

2947.839 --> 2957.2
yeah she's just a bit annoying sometimes

2952.16 --> 2959.64
that is not a troll that's just a person

2957.2 --> 2962.4399999999996
that just has a terrible habit of

2959.64 --> 2962.44
getting on people's

2962.92 --> 2967.52
nerves not a troll

2968.96 --> 2974.64
like trolls want to do

2971.44 --> 2977.2400000000002
that they try to figure out how to get

2974.64 --> 2981.2
on your nerves this person just does

2977.24 --> 2983.319
that and then basically is has an

2981.2 --> 2985.96
attitude of like yeah [ __ ] that I I will

2983.319 --> 2989.079
be the way that I am I'm not going to

2985.96 --> 2992.48
change because somebody's annoyed now

2989.079 --> 2995.1600000000003
that's the that's

2992.48 --> 2997.48
Eevee to start poking her she doesn't

2995.16 --> 3000.839
stop

2997.48 --> 3000.839
and she doesn't like to be

3004.2 --> 3007.9199999999996
accused who does

3014.88 --> 3020.44
right anyone doing something exiting

3054.44 --> 3062.799
worse and at least you you seem to have

3058.839 --> 3066.04
some capability of analysis to a

3062.799 --> 3068.92
degree I can appreciate that it's kind

3066.04 --> 3071.68
of the reason why I have why I'm like

3068.92 --> 3074.92
defending you cuz you don't seem like a

same situation

3137.559 --> 3143.7200000000003
though I'm starting to I get the idea

3140.68 --> 3145.359
that you're talking past each other

3143.72 --> 3148.68
because you're talking about different

3145.359 --> 3151.5989999999997

3507.64 --> 3513.4
[ __ ] and then like you don't really

3510.559 --> 3516.3190000000004

3513.4 --> 3516.319

3522.68 --> 3530.24
guess hey gzilla good see

3526.559 --> 3532.0

3530.24 --> 3536.72
GPR

3532.0 --> 3536.72

3551.559 --> 3557.96
Pros H endless Amusement from typing

3563.64 --> 3566.64
today

3581.0 --> 3590.48
you use GS Pro GS

3586.44 --> 3592.92
Pro I knew you would gzilla

3590.48 --> 3595.319
you Super Chat yeah I don't have him

3592.92 --> 3598.2000000000003
turned on

3595.319 --> 3602.799
because well I don't get anything out of

3598.2 --> 3605.68
it except for seeing Super Chat

3602.799 --> 3607.079
popups but I mean I literally don't get

3605.68 --> 3610.9199999999996
anything out of

3607.079 --> 3614.039
it so but I do take donations through

3610.92 --> 3616.96
the PayPal and the patreon though those

3614.039 --> 3616.96
I actually do

3620.599 --> 3625.6800000000003
get I mean if my financial setup would

3623.52 --> 3627.88
be different then I probably turn them

3625.68 --> 3631.2
back on but I mean it's still like

3627.88 --> 3636.1600000000003
Google keeps 45% of it

3631.2 --> 3636.16
okay so it is kind of a waste

3644.92 --> 3650.2400000000002
overall you blocked and booted me a year

3647.4 --> 3653.119
ago all right Tusk yeah I do vaguely

3650.24 --> 3655.0389999999998
remember you showing up but it was

3653.119 --> 3657.6400000000003
probably just terribly time

3655.039 --> 3661.039
it's like when I get super pissed off or

3657.64 --> 3664.5989999999997
something or really

3661.039 --> 3666.6400000000003
angry anxious or whatever and then new

3664.599 --> 3668.839
people start popping up and just

3666.64 --> 3671.92
pretending like nothing's going on that

3668.839 --> 3674.4
totally gets to me it's like when I'm

3671.92 --> 3677.0
super [ __ ]

3674.4 --> 3680.0
frustrated don't choose that moment to

3677.0 --> 3683.44
show up for the first time cuz I will

3680.0 --> 3685.4
think it's a troll just pretty much

3683.44 --> 3687.559
straightforward

3685.4 --> 3690.359
so that could have been it Tusk it's

3687.559 --> 3690.3590000000004
just terrible

3713.44 --> 3716.44
timing

3743.359 --> 3746.359
what

3753.039 --> 3760.7200000000003
oh yeah teret I kind of

3756.76 --> 3762.559
do but I mean I don't hate it it's just

3760.72 --> 3765.7599999999998
that I don't like if you're going to

3762.559 --> 3767.599
like talk about that for several minutes

3765.76 --> 3770.5200000000004
while I'm trying to talk about something

3767.599 --> 3773.039
else that's something that I find quite

3770.52 --> 3775.52
annoying but uh it's not like you could

3773.039 --> 3777.3590000000004
never bring it up

3775.52 --> 3781.079
it's just when you start to talk all

3777.359 --> 3784.0389999999998
crypto cricet right it it's like you

3781.079 --> 3786.88
guys like talk about Cricket but in a

3784.039 --> 3789.48
way that it's like not like super

3786.88 --> 3792.039
perceivable so that you can like get

3789.48 --> 3793.799
away with talking about Cricket before

3792.039 --> 3796.039
somebody figures out that you're talking

3793.799 --> 3798.64
about Cricket so that they could choose

3796.039 --> 3801.6800000000003
to stop it it's like this super

3798.64 --> 3801.68
effective cricet

3802.76 --> 3807.92
gossip you do do that sort of thing I've

3809.119 --> 3813.6400000000003
noticed like how to get away about with

3812.319 --> 3816.44
talking about

3813.64 --> 3818.68
sports when people don't appreciate you

3816.44 --> 3820.64
talking about sports well you talk about

3818.68 --> 3823.3999999999996
it in a way that the other was still

3820.64 --> 3825.2
understand but on people that don't know

3823.4 --> 3829.039
about the sports aren't fanatical about

3825.2 --> 3829.0389999999998
it won't catch on to that right

3833.279 --> 3836.279
away

3836.599 --> 3840.88
immersion trauma therapy what

3845.0 --> 3851.599
the Well from the word of it that seems

3849.119 --> 3855.1600000000003
pretty straightforward what that should

3851.599 --> 3857.76
be this just confrontation this it's

3855.16 --> 3862.799
like you have a trauma

3857.76 --> 3866.6400000000003
thing well get into it immerse right to

3862.799 --> 3869.72
face it so that you don't have the

3866.64 --> 3871.52
flight response as much so you can

3869.72 --> 3873.4399999999996
actually figure out how to deal with it

3871.52 --> 3876.079
so it is like a

3873.44 --> 3878.799
confrontation based

3876.079 --> 3883.079
therapy psychological confrontation

3878.799 --> 3883.079
based am I anywhere close their

3891.2 --> 3896.9199999999996
Tusk although calling it a therapy seems

3894.599 --> 3902.44
a bit much it's just like

3896.92 --> 3905.16
facing what you got you have PTSD what

3902.44 --> 3908.839
really

3905.16 --> 3908.839
how how do you have

3908.96 --> 3915.0
PTSD but thank you yeah I did get it

3912.319 --> 3915.0
right it's in the

3923.079 --> 3926.079
words

3927.24 --> 3935.0
right well if yeah immersion drama

3932.24 --> 3939.3999999999996
therapy is what I do continually right

3935.0 --> 3941.92
here on my show I dig up stuff about

3939.4 --> 3947.359
myself and my

3941.92 --> 3950.44
past I face myself I yeah I lay it down

3947.359 --> 3950.44
that's very

3952.359 --> 3959.52
confrontational right I I'm not afraid

3954.48 --> 3961.559
to point at like exactly how I am wrong

3959.52 --> 3964.48
or how I was

3961.559 --> 3965.559
like yeah well how it was wrong or how

3964.48 --> 3968.52
how it

3965.559 --> 3970.48
was misbehaving or whatever I'll Point

3968.52 --> 3972.96
straight at it just confess it straight

3970.48 --> 3976.52
out and actually like with complete

3972.96 --> 3979.2
silence as in no trying to cover it up

3976.52 --> 3983.0389999999998
no no it's just a full on confrontation

3979.2 --> 3986.0
like yeah this just that like yeah I was

3983.039 --> 3986.0
projecting

3986.319 --> 3993.599
and that's it just leave it like

3990.4 --> 3996.079
that and and that's the best way to like

3993.599 --> 3998.6800000000003
wean off gamma

3996.079 --> 4003.559
reflexes which because gamma reflexes

3998.68 --> 4005.7599999999998
are mostly focused on trying to cover up

4003.559 --> 4008.88
something

4005.76 --> 4012.039
shameful that's where it all starts it's

4008.88 --> 4015.359
all avoidance driven all distraction

4012.039 --> 4018.279
avoidance non-confrontation gamas are

4015.359 --> 4018.279
terrible at

4027.72 --> 4035.48
confrontation time in the forces oh

4031.359 --> 4037.799
you're a vet okay okay fair enough fair

4035.48 --> 4037.799
enough

4039.319 --> 4045.0389999999998
then I mean I've got definitely have

4042.279 --> 4048.52
some PTSD from my child but I'd like to

4045.039 --> 4051.079
think that I pretty much over it I mean

4048.52 --> 4053.7599999999998
I got a bit of a demonic rage type

4051.079 --> 4058.6800000000003
personality left over from

4053.76 --> 4061.039
it but other than that there's literally

4058.68 --> 4063.68
nothing I can do to change

4061.039 --> 4065.88
that that's manifested it's not going to

4063.68 --> 4068.2
go away ever like that's going to be

4065.88 --> 4071.0
with me till I die there's nothing I can

4068.2 --> 4072.64
do about it I can only like choose to

4071.0 --> 4076.799
not apply

4072.64 --> 4076.799
it when it could do a lot of

4083.76 --> 4089.44
damage but yeah confrontation but I did

4086.799 --> 4092.24
my freaking confrontation when I was a

4089.44 --> 4097.56
kid that's how I even got the freaking

4092.24 --> 4100.759
PTSD [ __ ] or rather echo of no it's not

4097.56 --> 4104.400000000001
PTSD because I faced it I faced it all I

4100.759 --> 4107.56
was feeling horrendous about my myself

4104.4 --> 4110.0
and like everything wrong and sickly and

4107.56 --> 4113.319
everything but I faced it and I went

4110.0 --> 4116.04
through it and they like I got savagely

4113.319 --> 4119.04
bullied by kids like sometimes they

4116.04 --> 4123.199
would literally like just have like an

4119.04 --> 4123.199
entire class do that

4124.239 --> 4128.5599999999995
together at the worst time like

4126.719 --> 4132.279
literally two

4128.56 --> 4136.080000000001
classes which was combined like 40 or 50

4132.279 --> 4137.759
people they all agreed that I sucked and

4136.08 --> 4143.239
would sing about

4137.759 --> 4146.88
that like during during like

4143.239 --> 4149.239
uh during break what do you call

4146.88 --> 4152.719
that terrible

4149.239 --> 4155.44
[ __ ] but I went through that entire

4152.719 --> 4157.44
school like I like no no you're not

4155.44 --> 4160.04
going to like chase me away I'm not

4157.44 --> 4160.04
going to go

4162.719 --> 4169.08
away it was a challenge and I won the

4166.48 --> 4172.04
challenge and I was a lot stronger for

4169.08 --> 4174.679
it though but you could definitely say

4172.04 --> 4177.96
it [ __ ] me up in

4174.679 --> 4180.08
ways I was like hyper confrontational

4177.96 --> 4181.52
when I still wasn't really ready to face

4180.08 --> 4186.48
the real world

4181.52 --> 4189.040000000001
yet I'd just done like Social Challenges

4186.48 --> 4192.3589999999995
like face to face situation type

4189.04 --> 4194.36
challenges that but I had could not

4192.359 --> 4196.76
handle the reality of the freaking world

4194.36 --> 4201.199
at all and I literally didn't know

4196.76 --> 4204.4800000000005
anybody that could like anybody family

4201.199 --> 4205.799999999999
people around me no one nobody [ __ ]

4204.48 --> 4209.4
could handle the

4205.8 --> 4212.76
reality and if I sometimes like pulled

4209.4 --> 4215.08
something out of nowhere like grabbed

4212.76 --> 4218.8
some string from the darkness like

4215.08 --> 4218.8
nobody would know what to do with

4219.6 --> 4226.56
that what made them think I

4222.239 --> 4226.5599999999995
sucked well that I kind of

4228.96 --> 4235.56
sucked I was hyper ego driven in a very

4233.0 --> 4238.8
clumsy

4235.56 --> 4240.400000000001
way I was very

4238.8 --> 4244.08
selfish

4240.4 --> 4246.12
conniving at times like easily offended

4244.08 --> 4249.6
and then very

4246.12 --> 4252.5599999999995
grudging just filled with terrible

4249.6 --> 4254.56
terrible social responses because all

4252.56 --> 4257.400000000001
these feelings and I didn't know what

4254.56 --> 4257.400000000001
the [ __ ] to do with

4260.08 --> 4267.44
him Flats versus T I watch tonight maybe

4264.199 --> 4267.44
low fruit sounds kind

4267.88 --> 4274.679
of I don't think it's going to be super

4270.52 --> 4274.679
exciting but yeah I'll take a

4282.56 --> 4285.56
look

4307.84 --> 4314.360000000001
angry ah ah

4310.48 --> 4316.759999999999
right right Tusk so you're like learning

4314.36 --> 4320.0
to control your anger are

4316.76 --> 4322.280000000001
you good

4320.0 --> 4324.88
good

4322.28 --> 4327.239
yes I like to make fun of that but yeah

4324.88 --> 4331.56
that's very

4327.239 --> 4334.08
important right I've learned it on my

4331.56 --> 4338.0
show quite a few

4334.08 --> 4340.36
times like because when you're angry

4338.0 --> 4343.08
everything looks

4340.36 --> 4345.5599999999995
different like your mind works different

4343.08 --> 4349.44
your feelings work different you look at

4345.56 --> 4354.04
things differently and it's very useful

4349.44 --> 4357.48
to be really capable of noticing

4354.04 --> 4360.239
that and like knowing what to do like

4357.48 --> 4363.28
also to be able to foresee how you are

4360.239 --> 4366.159
going to think about

4363.28 --> 4368.44
something when you're in an angry State

4366.159 --> 4372.92
when you're not in an angry state to

4368.44 --> 4375.44
know how you are when you are angry even

4372.92 --> 4379.2390000000005
from the perspec of perspective of not

4375.44 --> 4381.239
being when you get that right now you

4379.239 --> 4384.759999999999
have literally a gear system for

4381.239 --> 4387.28
yourself now your anger is no longer a

4384.76 --> 4388.8
disruptive factor it's just another

4387.28 --> 4392.08
piece of

4388.8 --> 4394.96
gear and that's what I made it to into

4392.08 --> 4398.84
I've worked hard for that on this

4394.96 --> 4398.84
channel to achieve

4401.52 --> 4407.52
that right because anger

4403.92 --> 4410.76
really should be another gear but with

4407.52 --> 4414.040000000001
the other gear comes another an entirely

4410.76 --> 4416.56
different world VI it

4414.04 --> 4420.08
does and you have

4416.56 --> 4422.84
to like have these two different World

4420.08 --> 4425.32
Views coexist

4422.84 --> 4427.2390000000005
simultaneously and know like oh this is

4425.32 --> 4429.639
where anger really needs to stay out of

4427.239 --> 4431.879999999999
the picture and here's when I really

4429.639 --> 4436.400000000001
need the anger because the other one the

4431.88 --> 4439.92
non anger will be too receptive too

4436.4 --> 4444.759999999999
going with to

4439.92 --> 4446.719
right gears anger in the normal State

4444.76 --> 4449.400000000001
very different perspective different

4446.719 --> 4452.2390000000005
conscious experience different way of

4449.4 --> 4455.239
looking at the world very important to

4452.239 --> 4455.239
get to know

4457.679 --> 4465.84
that self harm yes so that's yeah well

4461.76 --> 4468.1990000000005
that's yes if that's the tendency for

4465.84 --> 4470.400000000001
with your anger to to direct it toward

4468.199 --> 4472.36
yourself yeah then that's definitely

4470.4 --> 4475.199
something you have

4472.36 --> 4478.88
to well that's what you probably need

4475.199 --> 4482.32
serious therapy for like I've never I

4478.88 --> 4485.8
hated myself but I would never do self

4482.32 --> 4488.92
harm my form of self harm would be

4485.8 --> 4493.320000000001
rather and this did happen I would just

4488.92 --> 4497.52
insult somebody in such a like so bad so

4493.32 --> 4500.12
so [ __ ] bad so undeserved so I would

4497.52 --> 4503.120000000001
just make them attack

4500.12 --> 4509.48
me that's how I

4503.12 --> 4516.04
expressed my self loathing I never ever

4509.48 --> 4516.04
hurt myself never ever ever ever not a

4516.08 --> 4522.84
scratch like I would never get hurt on

4520.52 --> 4525.639
purpose only by accident like I punched

4522.84 --> 4526.8
the wall didn't even get hurt by that

4525.639 --> 4529.84
that sort of

4526.8 --> 4532.320000000001
thing but I would basically just if I

4529.84 --> 4533.92
just the Lo thing piled up I would just

4532.32 --> 4537.4
like walk to a

4533.92 --> 4540.52
person especially somebody that I knew

4537.4 --> 4543.5599999999995
and then just like [ __ ] like really

4540.52 --> 4545.320000000001
psychologically [ __ ] them up completely

4543.56 --> 4548.4800000000005
for nothing out of

4545.32 --> 4550.88
nowhere you could argue that that's even

4548.48 --> 4554.959999999999
like the effect that

4550.88 --> 4557.6
happened with the morgal

4554.96 --> 4560.36
the other day when I went berserk on him

4557.6 --> 4563.360000000001
that that is the effect that because it

4560.36 --> 4566.759999999999
kind of is right this what I'm just

4563.36 --> 4570.28
describing is perfectly that

4566.76 --> 4572.400000000001
really and it was fueled by insecurity I

4570.28 --> 4577.5599999999995
was projecting I already admitted all

4572.4 --> 4577.5599999999995
this so like now I'm relaying like the

4577.88 --> 4583.56
effect it's like I have self-loathing

4581.12 --> 4586.04
sometimes I don't feel good about myself

4583.56 --> 4589.84
I don't I know not to like start whining

4586.04 --> 4593.04
about it never never give into it but

4589.84 --> 4595.360000000001
with it does when I get humiliated or

4593.04 --> 4597.8
feel bad about like it increases then I

4595.36 --> 4599.759999999999
can lash out and that's the way I then

4597.8 --> 4604.56
do it it's

4599.76 --> 4607.52
like I attack somebody like really mean

4604.56 --> 4607.52
undeservedly

4607.639 --> 4611.2390000000005
mean it's [ __ ]

4612.08 --> 4617.5599999999995
up and it's very

4614.639 --> 4619.84
damaging but at least I don't literally

4617.56 --> 4622.8
damage myself I've never done

4619.84 --> 4627.28
that but I would basically make people

4622.8 --> 4629.4400000000005
hate me that's that's how I would be

4627.28 --> 4632.28
vengeful towards myself I would make

4629.44 --> 4632.28
other people hate

4641.12 --> 4648.639
me sabotage relation ships and

4644.199 --> 4651.5599999999995
friendships right well I think that the

4648.639 --> 4654.04
symptoms that you're like living through

4651.56 --> 4655.120000000001
is probably very similar to what I had

4654.04 --> 4658.12
or

4655.12 --> 4658.12
have

4659.92 --> 4665.52
partially I I mean I don't really have

4662.719 --> 4669.719
an extensive social life at

4665.52 --> 4672.1990000000005
all right now you probably do a lot more

4669.719 --> 4675.36
so you're going to bump into such

4672.199 --> 4678.96
challenges a lot lot more than I

4675.36 --> 4681.199
do with me it only really comes along on

4678.96 --> 4681.199
the

4696.36 --> 4702.5199999999995
internet allow yourself to have friends

4698.84 --> 4704.28
not be suspicious of them yeah well task

4702.52 --> 4706.360000000001
I don't think with me that's even going

4704.28 --> 4709.44
to work ever

4706.36 --> 4712.32
again because I had friends that were so

4709.44 --> 4712.32
[ __ ] up in

4724.48 --> 4730.5199999999995
ways but yeah it's

4727.32 --> 4732.48
not for me I think sometimes it's not

4730.52 --> 4734.92
even that I don't trust other people

4732.48 --> 4734.919999999999
it's that

4735.199 --> 4740.638999999999
I don't trust myself for picking the

4739.04 --> 4743.88
right

4740.639 --> 4743.88
people as

4750.719 --> 4756.8
friends oh well thank you MMA I

4753.44 --> 4760.239
appreciate that I think so

4756.8 --> 4763.4400000000005
too def definitely the anger part I'm

4760.239 --> 4766.36
really like focused because I

4763.44 --> 4767.96
wish that towards God it's like this

4766.36 --> 4771.159
needs to

4767.96 --> 4774.44
stop like I want more control I want

4771.159 --> 4777.879999999999
more Effectiveness and the anger

4774.44 --> 4779.599999999999
is interesting it's never really going

4777.88 --> 4782.8
to go away it's always going to be that

4779.6 --> 4787.120000000001
intense on the inside but it needs to

4782.8 --> 4790.6
take up less of a percentage of my

4787.12 --> 4790.599999999999
time that's a

4791.84 --> 4794.84
fact

4801.13 --> 4805.8
[Music]

4804.159 --> 4808.679
right anyway yeah good luck with the

4805.8 --> 4808.679
therapies there

4820.32 --> 4826.159
Tusk wow that's a very old

4826.76 --> 4832.1990000000005
account this is kind of dumb what's kind

4830.0 --> 4832.199
of

4834.199 --> 4839.919999999999
dumb but that the Earth is

4836.719 --> 4843.36
flat you don't like the

4839.92 --> 4845.36
title people like they really do come

4843.36 --> 4846.96
because there's trolls do come because

4845.36 --> 4848.159
there's just flat Earth in the title

4846.96 --> 4851.719
isn't

4848.159 --> 4855.719
there you actually do do

4851.719 --> 4855.719
that some people out

4855.96 --> 4861.56
there yeah but we're not actively

4858.679 --> 4863.52
talking about why the Earth is

4861.56 --> 4866.360000000001
definitely

4863.52 --> 4870.159000000001
flat and why the entire Globe model is

4866.36 --> 4870.159
all based of flat plane

4871.88 --> 4876.36
measurements I because well it's in the

4874.48 --> 4879.44
title but I usually just leave that to

4876.36 --> 4881.48
Fed because they literally don't ever

4879.44 --> 4883.5599999999995
talk about anything else

4881.48 --> 4887.678999999999
anymore and

4883.56 --> 4887.679
and it's making me

4888.04 --> 4894.639
dizzy I'm not that mathematical

4891.679 --> 4897.12
anyway I do well what I really do

4894.639 --> 4899.92
appreciate it for is the refined

4897.12 --> 4903.12
vernacular it's like they're all getting

4899.92 --> 4907.36
especially Nathan's just like improving

4903.12 --> 4909.76
the way to say things even more

4907.36 --> 4911.639
clearly and that is really interesting

4909.76 --> 4914.639
to follow for

4911.639 --> 4914.639
me

4916.159 --> 4921.239
the beliefs he claims to have oh really

4920.32 --> 4924.239
like

4921.239 --> 4924.239
what

4931.239 --> 4936.5199999999995
beliefs okay Tusk yeah good luck thanks

4933.88 --> 4936.52
for popping

4941.56 --> 4947.280000000001
by

4943.92 --> 4950.28
you can pick your nose you can pick your

4947.28 --> 4950.28
friends

4951.239 --> 4956.799999999999
sure but you can choose not to engage

4954.199 --> 4956.799999999999
with certain

4958.04 --> 4964.12
people and for some reason or in the

4961.159 --> 4966.839999999999
past it was probably frequency related

4964.12 --> 4968.4
as in internally I always got Drew in

4966.84 --> 4971.76
the

4968.4 --> 4974.12
weirdos weirdos that now would like

4971.76 --> 4977.320000000001
almost equate to

4974.12 --> 4982.08
sjws it wasn't bad though it was like

4977.32 --> 4984.799999999999
like one step above like not that

4982.08 --> 4987.92
obnoxious but it kind of was

4984.8 --> 4990.6
that and now I don't attract that any I

4987.92 --> 4995.12
do I don't even know who I am anymore in

4990.6 --> 4997.639
that sense socially like I haven't

4995.12 --> 5000.76
really engaged I haven't just gone out

4997.639 --> 5003.639
and just like meet people and

5000.76 --> 5007.6
[ __ ] because it would be completely

5003.639 --> 5011.639
different now I think because I am very

5007.6 --> 5014.719
very different from say 10 or especially

5011.639 --> 5016.719
20 years ago like my frequency my

5014.719 --> 5018.76
internal frequencies are completely

5016.719 --> 5020.159
different the energy that I radiate is

5018.76 --> 5023.84
very

5020.159 --> 5026.799999999999
different I don't know what I am right

5023.84 --> 5030.0
now in that sense I know what I used to

5026.8 --> 5033.639
be what always used to happen the people

5030.0 --> 5036.12
always that were like find yeah would

5033.639 --> 5039.4400000000005
like to talk to me and [ __ ] it's

5036.12 --> 5042.76
different now I don't know how I work in

5039.44 --> 5045.48
that sense anymore I'd have to like

5042.76 --> 5047.52
re-engage out there in an elaborate

5045.48 --> 5050.599999999999
social

5047.52 --> 5052.84
life something that I'm not super eager

5050.6 --> 5052.84
to

5061.36 --> 5064.36
do

5066.679 --> 5069.84
all right see you later Dr

5083.159 --> 5088.04
utar tet what are you talking

5091.04 --> 5095.08
about you're not not secretly talking

5093.48 --> 5098.5599999999995
about sports are

5095.08 --> 5098.5599999999995
you probably

5104.92 --> 5112.32
not right yeah yeah there are some

5108.4 --> 5115.119
weirdo prediction going on

5112.32 --> 5117.36
again but I mean seriously guys this

5115.119 --> 5119.88
[ __ ] happens don't you remember that

5117.36 --> 5121.96
that happens every year predictions

5119.88 --> 5124.0
predictions well there's this prediction

5121.96 --> 5126.2390000000005
now that somewhere in October like

5124.0 --> 5128.04
shit's really going to super heavy hit

5126.239 --> 5134.08
the fan and I

5128.04 --> 5137.639
mean like an actual hot World War II

5134.08 --> 5139.92
situation like way worse than just [ __ ]

5137.639 --> 5142.96
happening in

5139.92 --> 5144.4
Ukraine and remote viewers have actually

5142.96 --> 5147.159
seen

5144.4 --> 5151.239
that there's this group out there and

5147.159 --> 5154.44
they all like unexpectedly seeing like

5151.239 --> 5156.239
these things like very serious

5154.44 --> 5161.119
heavy

5156.239 --> 5165.718999999999
situation like over a lot of the

5161.119 --> 5167.32
world like it could very well be like

5165.719 --> 5168.719
well some the things that I've I don't

5167.32 --> 5171.04
know man I don't know if it's going to

5168.719 --> 5172.96
happen it just reminds me a lot because

5171.04 --> 5175.56
there were certain scenarios in in my

5172.96 --> 5175.56
Dark World

5176.32 --> 5180.5199999999995
[Applause]

5177.8 --> 5183.4800000000005
Vision so this might be like the

5180.52 --> 5186.1990000000005
freaking War the would be seen as the

5183.48 --> 5189.839999999999
war between Israel and

5186.199 --> 5189.839999999999
Iran that might

5193.119 --> 5200.239
happen yeah confirmed now not confirmed

5196.84 --> 5200.2390000000005
Aries 106 it's

5202.36 --> 5207.5599999999995
just it could

5204.48 --> 5210.119
happen or it could not happen let's hope

5207.56 --> 5210.119000000001
it doesn't

5211.199 --> 5214.199
happen

5217.8 --> 5221.76
remote control zombie yeah there's that

5219.88 --> 5225.400000000001
weird [ __ ] the

5221.76 --> 5229.2390000000005
5G vaccine controlling

5225.4 --> 5232.239
things which is that's going to probably

5229.239 --> 5235.839999999999
be real no matter how nutty that

5232.239 --> 5239.36
sounds that the 5G can like

5235.84 --> 5243.6
interface with the graphine oxide that

5239.36 --> 5245.5199999999995
is in like some of the vaxes

5243.6 --> 5248.84
pretty messed up but I don't know if

5245.52 --> 5251.320000000001
it's going to actually lead to like oh I

5248.84 --> 5252.96
am in control of zombie now no no no

5251.32 --> 5254.639
it's probably that just that they're all

5252.96 --> 5256.8
suddenly going to

5254.639 --> 5259.4400000000005
die like it's

5256.8 --> 5262.96
like okay let's turning on it's like

5259.44 --> 5265.28
everybody that had the V they just like

5262.96 --> 5267.4800000000005
start to feel sick and then they all die

5265.28 --> 5271.119
within like a couple of hours I think

5267.48 --> 5272.638999999999
that that's much more likely to

5271.119 --> 5275.719
happen

5272.639 --> 5279.1990000000005
yeah the zombie yeah but because you

5275.719 --> 5282.159
know like how how the [ __ ] are you going

5279.199 --> 5284.44
to control that like that makes no how

5282.159 --> 5286.599999999999
is it going to be

5284.44 --> 5290.0
no

5286.6 --> 5292.96
like graphine can't assemble in your

5290.0 --> 5296.199
body to like create complicated

5292.96 --> 5298.28
circuitry okay to have a program no it

5296.199 --> 5301.719
just doesn't work like it could suddenly

5298.28 --> 5304.679
activate start growing and then kill you

5301.719 --> 5309.32
perhaps apps right something like

5304.679 --> 5311.4400000000005
that but I mean there's no actual self

5309.32 --> 5314.679
forming

5311.44 --> 5319.159
computers from rudimentary substance

5314.679 --> 5322.04
like that's no that that doesn't

5319.159 --> 5324.0
exist it's not going to be a complicated

5322.04 --> 5325.239
thing like unless they already just had

5324.0 --> 5327.719
an

5325.239 --> 5329.599999999999
implant right and hey there could be man

5327.719 --> 5334.0
there could literally just be a freaking

5329.6 --> 5334.0
implant in the vaccine I don't know man

5335.52 --> 5338.8
who the hell knows what the hell is on

5337.239 --> 5341.799999999999
all that

5338.8 --> 5341.8
[ __ ]

5350.719 --> 5356.679
so it's just that like all this zombie

5355.119 --> 5360.5599999999995
nonsense is

5356.679 --> 5363.56
like just [ __ ] show it then just show

5360.56 --> 5366.56
that happening once

5363.56 --> 5370.080000000001
just one time an example of

5366.56 --> 5372.4400000000005
something that is like vaccinated and

5370.08 --> 5376.4
then remote control a dog or something

5372.44 --> 5382.119
like anything anything okay it's hor

5376.4 --> 5382.119
[ __ ] it only happens in [ __ ] Netflix

5384.88 --> 5389.92
series it's all just make

5390.92 --> 5395.92
belief

5392.8 --> 5398.18
can't remote control you like that not

5395.92 --> 5404.56
without an actual

5398.18 --> 5404.56
[Music]

5406.28 --> 5412.599999999999
implant right I mean if you'd be like so

5410.48 --> 5415.599999999999
freaking docile and weak that you

5412.6 --> 5419.159000000001
literally like do whatever anybody tells

5415.6 --> 5422.96
you which could be a state of mind right

5419.159 --> 5425.5199999999995
maybe they can like control bomiz people

5422.96 --> 5427.679
in a way that they turn into that or

5425.52 --> 5430.76
they're just like I'm just going to do

5427.679 --> 5433.92
whatever anybody says to me right and

5430.76 --> 5436.08
then perhaps like use remote beaming to

5433.92 --> 5438.56
like speak in their heads or

5436.08 --> 5441.6
something but other than that like I

5438.56 --> 5445.04
can't imagine like zombies that are

5441.6 --> 5447.719
going to do somebody's bidding like just

5445.04 --> 5447.719
just

5450.84 --> 5453.84
no

5462.639 --> 5467.639
you don't believe in astrology well

5464.679 --> 5470.28
that's your problem

5467.639 --> 5472.92
then because astrology definitely

5470.28 --> 5472.92
believes in

5480.76 --> 5483.76
you

5490.44 --> 5495.44
closest to zombies is drug addicts

5495.85 --> 5499.129000000001
[Music]

5510.76 --> 5513.76

5539.03 --> 5542.188999999999
[Music]

5570.639 --> 5573.639
that's

5579.88 --> 5583.159000000001
what am I going to put in the title

5600.56 --> 5603.56
today

5628.04 --> 5634.84
okay this is going to be it Community de

5631.84 --> 5634.84
gamification

5635.91 --> 5638.989

[Music]

5684.73 --> 5690.159
[Music]

5686.8 --> 5693.2390000000005
some of those guys on PCP achieve super

5690.159 --> 5695.719
strength yeah temporarily but I mean

5693.239 --> 5697.199
Richard you technically everybody does

5695.719 --> 5699.44
have super

5697.199 --> 5702.5199999999995
strength the problem is that super

5699.44 --> 5704.159
strength hurts it really [ __ ] hurts

5702.52 --> 5707.400000000001
and at the end of it it's like your

5704.159 --> 5707.4
muscles and [ __ ] are just

5719.96 --> 5729.199
worn see Emma just just take it

5725.36 --> 5732.159
easy Terra a good terce a cool

5729.199 --> 5734.5599999999995
guy he's just a little hotthe headed

5732.159 --> 5734.5599999999995
sometimes

5735.04 --> 5741.119
don't it's just a kind of a a very

5739.119 --> 5743.719
dominant Indian

5741.119 --> 5745.799999999999
guy but he's very cool he's a very

5743.719 --> 5748.4
protective

5745.8 --> 5753.400000000001
too

5748.4 --> 5753.4
just just take it easy

5758.04 --> 5764.159
yeah no but he is and he is cool I agree

5761.679 --> 5764.159
Akuma

5769.48 --> 5777.08
virus not all atheists are

5772.6 --> 5777.08
globers that's an interesting statement

5780.32 --> 5783.32
Emma

5784.6 --> 5790.0
but you are right there are some atheist

5787.32 --> 5790.96
flat earthers but I mean there's not a

5790.0 --> 5794.199
lot of

5790.96 --> 5797.04
them and they're like they're not very

5794.199 --> 5797.04
cohesive on

5800.6 --> 5804.320000000001
average atheist flat

5805.199 --> 5810.599999999999
earthers and by the way there's theist

5808.36 --> 5812.32
globers as well there's plenty of like

5810.6 --> 5815.4400000000005
Christian

5812.32 --> 5817.84
globers hordes of

5815.44 --> 5820.239
them they're mostly globers because they

5817.84 --> 5823.0
don't know any

5820.239 --> 5825.32
better they don't they don't think it's

5823.0 --> 5829.159
a globe because of the

5825.32 --> 5832.199
Bible they just think that the Bible

5829.159 --> 5833.679
doesn't exclude it being a globe because

5832.199 --> 5837.159
they haven't really thought about it too

5833.679 --> 5839.4
much but I mean plenty of globers are

5837.159 --> 5839.4
like

5840.199 --> 5843.199
Christians

5846.96 --> 5852.56
come on

5849.56 --> 5852.56
Emma

5853.4 --> 5856.92
just oh my

5870.199 --> 5873.199
God

5886.08 --> 5891.8
yeah he did say that Emma just take it

5889.4 --> 5896.48
easy

5891.8 --> 5898.599
or or like if this is going to get more

5896.48 --> 5903.119
Sparky I'm just going to set you up for

5898.599 --> 5903.119000000001
a date or something seriously

5916.52 --> 5919.689
[Music]

5923.92 --> 5929.719
that would be hilarious by the way if

5925.88 --> 5929.719
there was like a community and if

5929.8 --> 5937.360000000001
like a man and a woman are caught

5934.639 --> 5939.2390000000005
bickering that they'd be forced to go on

5937.36 --> 5942.5599999999995
a

5939.239 --> 5945.4
date I that might who knows that might

5942.56 --> 5947.679
actually work or something might work I

5945.4 --> 5950.638999999999
don't know no it's probably quite a

5947.679 --> 5950.639
stupid idea

5960.04 --> 5963.04
but

5973.61 --> 5977.28
[Music]

5975.239 --> 5980.08
right

5977.28 --> 5983.5199999999995
anyway I'm just surprised I got so many

5980.08 --> 5983.5199999999995
women on my channel these

5985.56 --> 5991.96
days I mean it's like it feels like it's

5988.239 --> 5996.44
half on half now I got like four girls

5991.96 --> 6000.88
in my chat although uh three

5996.44 --> 6000.879999999999

6010.28 --> 6015.719
lot of women also like interested in

6013.88 --> 6018.1990000000005
me it

6015.719 --> 6022.76
seemed but then after that I kind of

6018.199 --> 6024.96
stopped and then I got mostly guys

6022.76 --> 6028.679
but now there's a lot of new girls

6024.96 --> 6031.199
around recently and

6028.679 --> 6034.4800000000005

6320.679 --> 6328.28
actually thank them but other than just

6323.84 --> 6331.2390000000005

6370.0 --> 6376.599
thing but yeah he's having a tough time

6373.04 --> 6378.599
and and I'm glad that we're all like

6376.599 --> 6381.400000000001

6378.599 --> 6385.639

6381.4 --> 6388.598999999999
and then like yeah cuz that does in a

6385.639 --> 6391.679
way like make this sort of a second

6388.599 --> 6396.0
family it's like you know you can share

6391.679 --> 6399.0
that here and then get help sympathy

6396.0 --> 6399.0
tips

6399.08 --> 6405.04
right and I'm really happy about that

6401.76 --> 6406.96
I'm I'm so happy that I have this place

6405.04 --> 6409.639
even though it's virtual it's a virtual

6406.96 --> 6411.76
place on the internet where people can

6409.639 --> 6414.76
come together and like feel comfortable

6411.76 --> 6418.0
enough to share pretty intimate things

6414.76 --> 6418.0
and work it out

6419.119 --> 6423.48
together I'm just very happy about

6431.32 --> 6435.0
that okay have a

6439.32 --> 6443.679
feel don't buy a red car birds love

6442.08 --> 6447.5599999999995
crapping on

6443.679 --> 6449.28
it well it really depends on where you

6447.56 --> 6453.0
park the

6449.28 --> 6455.759999999999
car you see birds have typical flying

6453.0 --> 6458.599
routes and break

6455.76 --> 6461.4400000000005
locations you have to park them at just

6458.599 --> 6462.719
the right spot or then they will use it

6461.44 --> 6464.719
as target

6462.719 --> 6467.32
practice for

6464.719 --> 6469.0
[ __ ] I mean if it's red it's just

6467.32 --> 6470.92
going to be a little bit more inviting

6469.0 --> 6474.239
but it really depends on where it is

6470.92 --> 6476.639
standing if it is like a toilet place

6474.239 --> 6480.04
for the birds there's like certain

6476.639 --> 6480.04
places where they just love the

6499.239 --> 6502.239
[ __ ]

6502.84 --> 6508.679
cuz I used to have a red car and it it

6505.84 --> 6511.28
never really got [ __ ] on but it's

6508.679 --> 6514.92
also because every time I was somewhere

6511.28 --> 6518.08
I would always look at the area

6514.92 --> 6521.119
like is this a bird [ __ ]

6518.08 --> 6524.36
area cuz there are those and it's like

6521.119 --> 6525.219999999999
uh I'll just go around the corner then

6524.36 --> 6526.92
over

6525.22 --> 6529.76
[Music]

6526.92 --> 6532.1990000000005
there where it's not covered in Bird poo

6529.76 --> 6532.1990000000005
everywhere

6539.679 --> 6543.84
it was white didn't have too many issues

6541.599 --> 6546.88
well maybe it just didn't see it cuz

6543.84 --> 6546.88
Bird poo is white

6552.199 --> 6556.799999999999
too guarantee a bird will [ __ ] on

6559.119 --> 6562.119
it

6563.48 --> 6567.28
I wonder why that is though Emma maybe

6565.48 --> 6569.4
they're just pissed off that you're

6567.28 --> 6572.0
using that red color when they

6569.4 --> 6573.759999999999
associated with fruits but it isn't

6572.0 --> 6578.0
fruit so they're

6573.76 --> 6580.320000000001
like how dare you seduce me like with

6578.0 --> 6582.04
with fruit and then not have the fruit

6580.32 --> 6584.08
and so they [ __ ] all over it maybe

6582.04 --> 6586.48
that's the reason I don't

6584.08 --> 6590.239
know is

6586.48 --> 6595.04
weird yeah don't park by light poles

6590.239 --> 6597.638999999999
exactly or like right

6595.04 --> 6601.4
like at a parking spot that's like

6597.639 --> 6603.159000000001
really close to the roof of a house they

6601.4 --> 6605.799999999999
love to sit on the edge and then [ __ ]

6603.159 --> 6605.799999999999
all over the

6608.679 --> 6615.119
place or like directly under a tree like

6612.8 --> 6618.360000000001
especially if it's a tree that has that

6615.119 --> 6618.36
well that has fruits in

6619.04 --> 6624.44
it birds are going to be eating those

6621.719 --> 6628.679
fruits and then [ __ ] on the on the

6624.44 --> 6630.759999999999
car anyway this is a weird subject I'm

6628.679 --> 6636.04
going to round out the show now what a

6630.76 --> 6639.04
weird shitty on the on car subject odd

6636.04 --> 6641.36
anyway I I not fully agree I used to

6639.04 --> 6642.639
have a red car and it wasn't continually

6641.36 --> 6645.639
getting shat

6642.639 --> 6648.599
on then again I wouldn't like wash it

6645.639 --> 6650.639
until it's like shiny red all the time I

6648.599 --> 6654.679
did kind of like like to keep it a bit

6650.639 --> 6658.4400000000005
dirty but not terribly dirty but a

6654.679 --> 6660.28
bit and then if it gets shed on I could

6658.44 --> 6664.199
literally like clean it and it's like

6660.28 --> 6667.44
the dirt protected the car from the [ __ ]

6664.199 --> 6670.159
so it didn't damage the paint huh it's a

6667.44 --> 6672.719
good reason not to wash your car is

6670.159 --> 6674.879999999999
because the dirt actually protects the

6672.719 --> 6679.199
paint against

6674.88 --> 6681.36
[ __ ] and yes that's literally not a joke

6679.199 --> 6685.04
I literally had that stratey I didn't

6681.36 --> 6687.239
wash my car I didn't give a [ __ ] it had

6685.04 --> 6689.76
some Rust places too and all that so I

6687.239 --> 6692.5199999999995
was like just leave it just leave it

6689.76 --> 6694.639
looking like a dirty old car not too

6692.52 --> 6698.079000000001
