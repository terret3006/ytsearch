95.36 --> 98.479
so yeah today

98.56 --> 102.07900000000001
weather is kind of similar to yesterday

100.56 --> 104.96000000000001
except now it's

102.079 --> 104.96
cleared up a little

106.64 --> 110.0
so

108.079 --> 111.91999999999999
a bright sun is

110.0 --> 115.479
lighting up all the different colored

111.92 --> 115.479
leaves out there

116.24 --> 119.28
quite a beautiful sight

126.799 --> 130.479
doesn't seem to be much wind blowing

131.28 --> 135.76
so it's overall very pleasant

133.84 --> 138.56
but still cold it's like 10 degrees

135.76 --> 138.56
celsius still

140.0 --> 143.16
all right

149.2 --> 153.2
hello crockett first in chat

154.48 --> 160.11999999999998
it is thursday the 4th of november 2021

164.959 --> 169.92000000000002
i don't know if i'm going to be doing a

166.8 --> 172.08
full two hour show today yeah i i didn't

169.92 --> 175.76
sleep all that well

172.08 --> 179.12
not due to alcohol or anything but

175.76 --> 179.12
it's just to feel a little

180.0 --> 184.959
i hope it like goes away as the show

182.4 --> 187.28
progresses it sometimes does

184.959 --> 189.519
and if it doesn't then i might kind of

187.28 --> 193.64000000000001
round out early and i don't know maybe

189.519 --> 193.64000000000001
take a walk or something outside

202.4 --> 207.68
anyway so yeah

204.08 --> 207.68
yesterday's show was great

209.12 --> 213.799
a lot of good feedback from it too

217.44 --> 222.599
but yeah i don't know if today is going

218.879 --> 222.599
to be show like that

226.239 --> 228.4
m

230.159 --> 234.0
all right but we'll see whatever happens

231.92 --> 234.0
and

238.159 --> 243.519
and if it all becomes a bit too much for

240.0 --> 243.519
me i'll just round out quickly

245.68 --> 248.56
right because yeah not getting enough

247.36 --> 251.68
sleep

248.56 --> 253.599
it's not good also i noticed

251.68 --> 257.12
that it's also

253.599 --> 257.12
a big influence seems to be

258.4 --> 263.35999999999996
like the excitement level

261.44 --> 266.4
in the night

263.36 --> 269.68
and yeah i got very excited yesterday

266.4 --> 271.12
like when gaming like pretty deep into

269.68 --> 274.24
the night and i think that that is

271.12 --> 275.759
really the thing that's not

274.24 --> 278.08
too healthy

275.759 --> 281.08000000000004
when i then don't proceed not to sleep

278.08 --> 281.08
enough

282.24 --> 287.24
hello nathan oakley 1980 good to see you

297.36 --> 301.84000000000003
yeah flutters debates was good too

299.199 --> 301.84000000000003
yesterday

307.68 --> 310.68
uh

314.72 --> 318.88000000000005
what else

316.32 --> 318.88
was there

319.759 --> 324.44
all right uh mitchell from australia

329.12 --> 333.68
i had a pretty amazing

331.039 --> 337.36
flatter school episode

333.68 --> 340.16
with some fantastic footage

337.36 --> 342.32
like a new black swan footage that might

340.16 --> 344.32000000000005
even be better than like the the

342.32 --> 347.12
original one

344.32 --> 349.919
very impressive footage

347.12 --> 353.639
it's not just one shot basically but a

349.919 --> 353.639
whole bunch of things

353.919 --> 357.59999999999997
so yeah if you haven't watched this show

355.84 --> 360.0
yesterday i definitely definitely

357.6 --> 363.56
recommend you watch it back just to

360.0 --> 363.56
check out the footage

380.56 --> 383.56
okay

394.08 --> 397.24
all right

408.639 --> 412.28000000000003
hello mike sidunich

428.56 --> 432.039
hey lg

443.199 --> 448.52000000000004
double zap

444.72 --> 448.52000000000004
thrilling what

459.52 --> 462.52
ah

476.479 --> 480.35999999999996
a

477.36 --> 480.36
flick

495.44 --> 500.24
right so yeah a situation also happened

497.68 --> 502.639
like last night that's a little annoying

500.24 --> 502.639
i guess

503.12 --> 506.16
uh

504.56 --> 507.759
indirectly

506.16 --> 509.44
but yeah rv

507.759 --> 511.84000000000003
russian fitz had this stream with

509.44 --> 513.36
somebody

511.84 --> 515.12
and

513.36 --> 517.12
maybe it's just the mood or something

515.12 --> 518.88
but he was like he proceeded to

517.12 --> 520.719
basically

518.88 --> 523.919
talk bad about a whole bunch of people

520.719 --> 527.279
on this on the flatter scene

523.919 --> 527.279
and it was really annoying

527.519 --> 531.92
i tried to kind of like comment on it in

530.08 --> 534.9200000000001
this chat but then ended up getting

531.92 --> 534.92
banned

543.36 --> 547.04
yeah so

545.279 --> 549.519
that was kind of annoying so he was

547.04 --> 552.64
taking jabs aft at

549.519 --> 555.04
david weiss and jaron

552.64 --> 558.4399999999999
i don't even understand why

555.04 --> 558.4399999999999
he did that

572.56 --> 577.8389999999999
maybe it has something to do with the

574.88 --> 577.8389999999999
way i'm feeling

580.399 --> 584.399
i don't know

582.399 --> 586.64
but mostly it's just not getting enough

584.399 --> 588.88
sleep that does this

586.64 --> 592.88
right but may yeah i'll probably be all

588.88 --> 597.24
right in like half an hour or something

592.88 --> 597.24
i'm already feeling a little bit better

604.64 --> 607.8389999999999
hello george sanford

609.279 --> 613.6
is there any validity to what he was

611.279 --> 613.6
saying

616.8 --> 619.8
um

621.44 --> 623.9200000000001
a little

625.12 --> 629.04
but it just seemed kind of pointless

629.36 --> 634.64
he was kind of like saying oh like that

632.88 --> 638.0
was so weird

634.64 --> 641.1999999999999
like oh david weiss is

638.0 --> 643.44
basically off the devil because he

641.2 --> 645.6800000000001
said something about other sons and

643.44 --> 648.8800000000001
moons

645.68 --> 651.279
and that's so anti-biblical accord it

648.88 --> 653.519
just it was kind of a very weak train of

651.279 --> 653.519
thought

653.839 --> 657.6400000000001
it's just weird

675.68 --> 678.68
so

702.88 --> 706.88
are you talking about ben

704.959 --> 709.3599999999999
what is that his name

706.88 --> 711.12
rv russian vids i don't know what his

709.36 --> 715.16
name is i don't know what he looks like

711.12 --> 715.16
i know he's been around forever

745.12 --> 749.68
oh okay ben he is called then all right

747.44 --> 752.6800000000001
all right i didn't know that

749.68 --> 752.68
thanks

763.82 --> 768.32
[Music]

766.24 --> 770.16
i mean yeah he's been a flat earther for

768.32 --> 772.399
a long time he's also one of the people

770.16 --> 776.3199999999999
that really put the no trees

772.399 --> 778.8
on flat earth onto the scene at the time

776.32 --> 783.48
but i've always felt like he's like a

778.8 --> 783.4799999999999
2015 flat earther

789.12 --> 793.04
so yeah it's just rigid

794.959 --> 799.3599999999999
i don't know

797.2 --> 801.519
maybe you wish just in one of these like

799.36 --> 803.36
weird inviting moods and

801.519 --> 807.12
maybe he'll just turn around again i

803.36 --> 807.12
don't know man i don't really follow him

807.2 --> 812.9200000000001
it was just brought to my attention

808.959 --> 812.92
through the skype chat

820.8 --> 824.56
heavy government middle east and

823.36 --> 826.88
journalists

824.56 --> 826.88
okay

826.959 --> 830.4799999999999
well that doesn't surprise me

833.36 --> 838.279
if that's actually true george sanford

848.56 --> 853.68
but right any of you checked out uh

851.12 --> 856.079
mitchell from australia's

853.68 --> 859.5999999999999
show yesterday with the new black swan

856.079 --> 859.5999999999999
footage it's really good

860.32 --> 864.639
like i really want you to check it out

865.839 --> 872.24
and just go through his video link it up

869.92 --> 877.199
and just scroll through it until you

872.24 --> 881.12
find well what obviously seems like uh

877.199 --> 882.639
beach footage with another oil rig

881.12 --> 884.72
multiple

882.639 --> 885.6800000000001
and just take a look at that part play

884.72 --> 887.1990000000001
it

885.68 --> 890.8389999999999
it's really

887.199 --> 890.8389999999999
really good footage

902.24 --> 906.0790000000001
yeah and again my compliments to

904.24 --> 908.0
mitchell from australia

906.079 --> 909.92
i think i've been skipping out on a lot

908.0 --> 913.44
of his streams

909.92 --> 915.519
mostly because because made by jim bob

913.44 --> 917.1990000000001
typically goes live roughly at the same

915.519 --> 920.399
time

917.199 --> 921.4399999999999
and i really like sitting in his chat

920.399 --> 923.92
and like

921.44 --> 927.0400000000001
talking and there's also interesting

923.92 --> 929.8389999999999
people that kind of associate with owen

927.04 --> 929.8389999999999
benjamin there

930.0 --> 934.959
so for me it's more personally

932.24 --> 936.88
interesting like that

934.959 --> 939.5999999999999
but yeah i do think that mitchell from

936.88 --> 941.8389999999999
australia is like a real sport he's

939.6 --> 941.839
really

941.92 --> 947.759
taken on flat earth knighthood to do

944.72 --> 949.839
that and he's fair he's very passionate

947.759 --> 952.16
and dedicated and i think he's doing a

949.839 --> 952.1600000000001
great

952.839 --> 958.72
job and at the same time he also like

956.0 --> 960.959
has a family and

958.72 --> 960.9590000000001
right

961.279 --> 965.759
so yeah i really do hope that he gets

964.399 --> 967.04
the support

965.759 --> 968.9590000000001
that he needs

967.04 --> 971.12
financial support because he probably

968.959 --> 972.6389999999999
does need it being in australia for

971.12 --> 974.24
starters

972.639 --> 976.72
with all the issues that are happening

974.24 --> 976.72
over there

977.199 --> 983.4399999999999
so yeah mitchell from australia your ace

980.959 --> 985.7589999999999
don't worry if i don't show up in your

983.44 --> 988.399
streams

985.759 --> 990.9590000000001
i try to

988.399 --> 992.959
but yeah i've said it before i sometimes

990.959 --> 995.3599999999999
think it's just not really directed at

992.959 --> 997.92
me because he seems to be like really

995.36 --> 1000.48
aiming at the kind of more newbie flat

997.92 --> 1000.4799999999999
earthers

1001.12 --> 1006.32
and i think he's doing a great job at it

1004.0 --> 1008.88
like way better than i do but yeah i've

1006.32 --> 1011.839
never really aimed at newcomer flat

1008.88 --> 1011.8389999999999
earthers

1012.639 --> 1015.6
rather the opposite

1022.639 --> 1026.16
right also nathan oakley

1025.439 --> 1028.959
is

1026.16 --> 1031.52
still going

1028.959 --> 1033.76
i hope he gets the support together

1031.52 --> 1037.199
through his gofundme to pay for his new

1033.76 --> 1040.319
pr yeah for the projector repairs

1037.199 --> 1042.4
so yeah also especially on the short run

1040.319 --> 1044.079
support him

1042.4 --> 1046.16
because we just want

1044.079 --> 1048.559
him to keep doing what he does and for

1046.16 --> 1050.3200000000002
that he needs to get it all fixed and

1048.559 --> 1051.6789999999999
paid for and all that

1050.32 --> 1053.84
right

1051.679 --> 1054.64
and as soon as i kind of hear that he's

1053.84 --> 1057.1999999999998
there

1054.64 --> 1059.76
i will start to like probably go start

1057.2 --> 1060.72
my own gofundme

1059.76 --> 1063.84
or

1060.72 --> 1064.88
yeah basically do a run for it

1063.84 --> 1067.76
because

1064.88 --> 1070.0
yeah my monitor has issues as i've said

1067.76 --> 1072.16
i i'm not sure if it's going to last

1070.0 --> 1072.16
like

1073.039 --> 1077.28
in until next year

1075.679 --> 1081.76
although i've figured out a bit of a

1077.28 --> 1081.76
trick on how to get it started now

1085.76 --> 1090.08
so it's less of a hassle

1088.32 --> 1091.76
but i don't know

1090.08 --> 1093.84
i've been looking around for new

1091.76 --> 1095.6
monitors like what could be good to

1093.84 --> 1098.0
replace it

1095.6 --> 1100.0
also surface day dutch sailor formerly

1098.0 --> 1102.0
known as dutch sailor

1100.0 --> 1104.64
seems to have could be a dug up a

1102.0 --> 1107.84
monitor somewhere and yeah

1104.64 --> 1109.2
it i've looked up the specs it seemed

1107.84 --> 1111.12
okay

1109.2 --> 1112.24
but i don't know again it's always

1111.12 --> 1113.84
tricky

1112.24 --> 1115.84
with monitors

1113.84 --> 1117.76
like it's not just oh all monitors are

1115.84 --> 1120.1599999999999
the same no they aren't

1117.76 --> 1123.84
especially because of the color

1120.16 --> 1123.8400000000001
system that it uses

1124.88 --> 1129.679
and it like that

1127.2 --> 1132.88
that is not an easy thing it's not like

1129.679 --> 1134.799
oh this has a 10 for color right no it's

1132.88 --> 1137.5200000000002
difficult and it's different for each

1134.799 --> 1140.0
person

1137.52 --> 1142.24
and it's it's kind of hard to find the

1140.0 --> 1143.679
exact right

1142.24 --> 1146.4
sort of

1143.679 --> 1148.0800000000002
yeah light and screen output that's

1146.4 --> 1150.24
really

1148.08 --> 1152.24
good for you and that doesn't like it

1150.24 --> 1155.44
make you end up having a headache after

1152.24 --> 1158.16
a while etc etc

1155.44 --> 1159.76
so yeah i don't know if his monitor will

1158.16 --> 1162.16
help with that

1159.76 --> 1165.84
but i really do appreciate at least that

1162.16 --> 1165.8400000000001
he did dig it up

1166.16 --> 1171.799
so i might be getting that one

1168.559 --> 1171.799
this sunday

1181.12 --> 1186.7199999999998
right and if it if it's not really

1184.24 --> 1188.4
good enough

1186.72 --> 1189.76
well then at least

1188.4 --> 1192.799
true yeah

1189.76 --> 1194.559
that should have tried

1192.799 --> 1196.8799999999999
and yeah i've been looking around for

1194.559 --> 1199.76
new monitor that would probably end up

1196.88 --> 1203.7600000000002
being around 300 euros

1199.76 --> 1207.84
between 250 and 300

1203.76 --> 1207.84
but i'm gonna have to do more research

1207.919 --> 1211.6000000000001
maybe like go to electronics

1210.32 --> 1214.1589999999999
store

1211.6 --> 1216.8799999999999
and ask the people there

1214.159 --> 1218.88
like yeah what i have this monitor what

1216.88 --> 1220.88
do you think would probably be the best

1218.88 --> 1225.0390000000002
for me this is kind of what i want this

1220.88 --> 1228.7990000000002
is the color thing etc etc

1225.039 --> 1228.799
right but yeah that's

1229.6 --> 1233.32
for another time

1234.0 --> 1239.52
for now i just mainly need support

1237.2 --> 1242.24
just to keep going in my own financial

1239.52 --> 1242.24
situation

1246.799 --> 1251.2
happy to report that

1248.96 --> 1255.1200000000001
overall my debt hasn't increased at

1251.2 --> 1255.1200000000001
least this month so that's a good thing

1257.44 --> 1261.799
thank you for everybody that has

1258.799 --> 1261.799
supported

1268.159 --> 1271.7600000000002
yeah cleary hello

1273.679 --> 1277.8400000000001
otto flicks auto flick

1295.76 --> 1298.76
hmm

1316.159 --> 1320.0800000000002
right so yeah guys what are you up to

1320.799 --> 1324.8799999999999
i think i pretty much covered everything

1326.0 --> 1330.84
from yesterday flat earth related

1338.32 --> 1343.28
oh yeah mark sergeant also uploaded like

1341.12 --> 1345.76
a rob skipper video

1343.28 --> 1350.0
i think it's from like well from a new

1345.76 --> 1350.0
zealand expo i don't know when that was

1352.64 --> 1358.159
i think it's even at least it must be

1354.799 --> 1361.679
like 2019 or something it's pre-coveted

1358.159 --> 1363.7600000000002
but yeah it was a really good interview

1361.679 --> 1366.24
interesting to watch it back now after

1363.76 --> 1366.24
everything

1369.2 --> 1374.96
everyone hangs out at geo server you

1372.159 --> 1378.3200000000002
mean

1374.96 --> 1379.6000000000001
geoshifter like who who's geo's server i

1378.32 --> 1382.6
don't know what you're talking about

1379.6 --> 1382.6
clearly

1421.919 --> 1426.679
oh okay lsg interesting

1458.159 --> 1461.159
um

1474.72 --> 1478.1200000000001
hello glitch

1492.72 --> 1495.72
do

1511.039 --> 1514.039
uh

1516.64 --> 1520.64
right for those that that have just

1518.559 --> 1523.6789999999999
joined the stream

1520.64 --> 1525.919
yeah i feel a little wonky not because

1523.679 --> 1529.2
of alcohol but because of not enough

1525.919 --> 1532.3200000000002
sleep last night

1529.2 --> 1532.32
so yeah

1540.08 --> 1546.1589999999999
don't know if i'm gonna do the full

1541.76 --> 1546.1589999999999
stream today but we'll see where it goes

1551.84 --> 1556.48
if yeah if you want to bring up any

1553.84 --> 1560.08
subject that's fine

1556.48 --> 1560.08
i'm actually hoping for it

1563.6 --> 1568.279
all right anyway be back two minutes

1658.48 --> 1661.48
hmm

1678.96 --> 1682.76
hey steamy traveler

1707.919 --> 1713.3600000000001
all right how's g does your dog have a

1710.48 --> 1716.24
the knack the name tag too

1713.36 --> 1719.6399999999999
or does everybody just know your dog's

1716.24 --> 1719.64
name is red

1745.6 --> 1748.6
what

1766.96 --> 1773.039
he is red it's on his toe

1769.279 --> 1775.279
you mean his collar is also kind of red

1773.039 --> 1778.279
she's like one of the red brown hair

1775.279 --> 1778.279
dogs

1782.0 --> 1785.76
yes

1784.0 --> 1788.399
okay godzilla

1785.76 --> 1788.399
37

1789.039 --> 1793.399
that's

1790.399 --> 1793.399
silly

1799.6 --> 1802.6
so

1817.919 --> 1820.919
hmm

1823.6 --> 1827.76
i think it's finally sinking through

1828.72 --> 1832.08
i think it might also have something to

1830.96 --> 1834.88
do with

1832.08 --> 1837.1999999999998
like what i ate yesterday

1834.88 --> 1838.3990000000001
didn't eat like super late

1837.2 --> 1841.6000000000001
there was like

1838.399 --> 1844.08
i made garlic sauce really nice fresh

1841.6 --> 1846.9599999999998
but i think that when you eat that and

1844.08 --> 1849.96
then you don't sleep enough it usually

1846.96 --> 1849.96
like

1850.0 --> 1855.399
can feel it

1852.159 --> 1855.3990000000001
it's weird

1865.84 --> 1870.24
so i guess my conclusion would be if

1868.64 --> 1872.7990000000002
you're going to eat some kind of garlic

1870.24 --> 1875.1200000000001
sauce make sure you sleep well that

1872.799 --> 1875.12
night

1876.48 --> 1881.2
don't know if that's that means anything

1879.12 --> 1883.1999999999998
to you

1881.2 --> 1885.8400000000001
i'm gonna try to do that try to pay

1883.2 --> 1885.8400000000001
attention to

1890.84 --> 1897.799
that a matthew hall

1894.159 --> 1897.7990000000002
purple poultice

1906.88 --> 1912.3200000000002
yeah matthew yeah i'm okay

1909.679 --> 1915.2
i'm not like sick or anything i just i

1912.32 --> 1917.4399999999998
got a little over excited last night

1915.2 --> 1919.679
way too late

1917.44 --> 1922.799
i think i effectively stayed up until

1919.679 --> 1924.159
like six is not good

1922.799 --> 1927.6
and so

1924.159 --> 1930.5590000000002
yeah i didn't get enough sleep

1927.6 --> 1932.799
so i feel like like a little like

1930.559 --> 1935.36
but not like oh my god i'm gonna throw

1932.799 --> 1937.039
up or anything it's just like

1935.36 --> 1938.8799999999999
it's not really flowing right now but

1937.039 --> 1940.799
it's getting better already it's now

1938.88 --> 1942.72
already much better than when i just

1940.799 --> 1944.0
started up the show

1942.72 --> 1946.0
so maybe

1944.0 --> 1949.559
like in the next half hour it will go

1946.0 --> 1949.559
completely away

1953.519 --> 1960.159
and i think i did like put down

1957.039 --> 1960.1589999999999
everything pretty much

1960.399 --> 1966.6
some events that happened and

1962.64 --> 1966.6000000000001
good streams from yesterday

1977.2 --> 1981.679
i just have to pay good attention to my

1979.2 --> 1981.679
breathing

1981.76 --> 1985.799
everything will be all right

1991.6 --> 1996.9599999999998
owen's last show which one is that

1994.64 --> 2001.2
instead breaking the matrix because

1996.96 --> 2003.919
that's the last one i've seen uploaded

2001.2 --> 2005.519
tuesday so i haven't seen if he had done

2003.919 --> 2007.919
a wednesday show i haven't seen it

2005.519 --> 2009.919
uploaded yet on bed shoot so

2007.919 --> 2014.279
but yeah breaking the matrix was a

2009.919 --> 2014.279
really really good show

2019.6 --> 2022.799
i think

2020.559 --> 2024.8799999999999
most of his shows recently are really

2022.799 --> 2027.279
good it's like he found a new level or

2024.88 --> 2027.279
something

2029.6 --> 2035.1589999999999
like

2030.559 --> 2035.1589999999999
the energy is so good

2061.28 --> 2064.8
right so yeah

2062.56 --> 2067.04
because

2064.8 --> 2068.96
these days i typically like

2067.04 --> 2073.359
when i go to bed it's like ah get my

2068.96 --> 2075.28
mind off that game or something right

2073.359 --> 2077.359
to calm down otherwise i can't sleep i'm

2075.28 --> 2079.76
just be like

2077.359 --> 2082.0
and watching owen benjamin is just

2079.76 --> 2084.5600000000004
really relaxing quickly

2082.0 --> 2087.28
so i usually end up watching just like a

2084.56 --> 2090.399
half an hour owen benjamin

2087.28 --> 2090.3990000000003
before going to bed

2090.96 --> 2094.52
it works great

2102.8 --> 2105.44
telegram

2110.16 --> 2112.48
okay

2112.72 --> 2117.2
well look maybe he's going to upload it

2114.8 --> 2119.76
late it does it happens more often i

2117.2 --> 2122.56
don't mind it's not like oh i have to

2119.76 --> 2125.599
see it right now or everything goes to

2122.56 --> 2126.88
[ __ ] no no no no if i see is a live

2125.599 --> 2128.7200000000003
stream he did

2126.88 --> 2131.7200000000003
like two or three days later i don't

2128.72 --> 2131.72
mind

2174.4 --> 2177.4
um

2306.72 --> 2311.359
oh right also

2308.64 --> 2314.359
a territory

2311.359 --> 2314.359
3006

2316.64 --> 2320.2799999999997
i watched some

2326.24 --> 2329.4399999999996
a quantum conscience

2334.56 --> 2340.64
but yeah it was like it was too much

2337.599 --> 2342.8
what's it this morning before the show

2340.64 --> 2344.96
but like i got i was shocked to hear

2342.8 --> 2347.52
like other details like for example

2344.96 --> 2350.88
apparently according to him

2347.52 --> 2352.8
even the movie akira

2350.88 --> 2356.56
which was supposedly taking place in the

2352.8 --> 2359.76
future was said to be

2356.56 --> 2362.64
like that there was some kind of a

2359.76 --> 2365.0400000000004
virus outbreak in that too i hadn't even

2362.64 --> 2365.04
noticed

2365.119 --> 2369.6400000000003
and that movie is really old

2369.76 --> 2372.96
that's like in the 80s

2373.839 --> 2380.0
the movie that

2375.599 --> 2382.4
like really seriously had impressed me

2380.0 --> 2385.599
back in the day i would like watch it

2382.4 --> 2385.599
like a lot

2385.76 --> 2390.96
because of just the animation quality

2387.92 --> 2395.48
was just unheard of for that time it was

2390.96 --> 2395.48
all hand drawn no cgi

2408.839 --> 2413.2
what

2410.56 --> 2417.64
that show was the closest he has come to

2413.2 --> 2417.64
god what are you talking about clutch

2434.56 --> 2438.92
hello professor phil bell

2471.839 --> 2477.2799999999997
yeah i did finish

2474.56 --> 2478.56
point of life and god okay

2477.28 --> 2481.76
right but

2478.56 --> 2482.72
okay closest well he's been on to that

2481.76 --> 2485.76
for

2482.72 --> 2485.7599999999998
for weeks

2486.24 --> 2491.9599999999996
so when i heard him say that that wasn't

2488.16 --> 2491.96
really new to me

2496.96 --> 2501.68
but yeah i really do respect

2499.599 --> 2502.48
owens

2501.68 --> 2505.1189999999997
like

2502.48 --> 2505.119
theology

2505.92 --> 2510.48
it it's very close to my own and what

2508.319 --> 2512.88
i've been trying to figure out and

2510.48 --> 2512.88
develop

2514.56 --> 2519.2799999999997
and in a practical sense i think he's

2516.64 --> 2521.2
doing a better job at it

2519.28 --> 2523.28
if i have to be honest and i have to

2521.2 --> 2524.7999999999997
because that's one of the things that is

2523.28 --> 2527.6800000000003
part of the path

2524.8 --> 2527.6800000000003
you have to be honest

2528.079 --> 2532.04
about

2529.04 --> 2532.04
everything

2539.92 --> 2544.56
it's better to hold your tongue

2542.319 --> 2548.52
than to open your mouth and let

2544.56 --> 2548.52
dishonesty come out

2562.8 --> 2565.8390000000004
what

2563.68 --> 2565.839
oh

2570.96 --> 2574.48
yeah you're talking about quantum of

2572.64 --> 2575.5989999999997
conscious right matt

2574.48 --> 2578.079
howe's g

2575.599 --> 2581.04
yeah yeah uh i don't know i don't watch

2578.079 --> 2581.04
all his videos

2585.76 --> 2589.76
i don't know even how to say it it's

2588.16 --> 2591.839
like

2589.76 --> 2594.3190000000004
a lot of the times i think his videos

2591.839 --> 2597.04
are like too far

2594.319 --> 2599.599
they're too dug in

2597.04 --> 2599.599
too much

2603.839 --> 2608.319
but he is

2605.359 --> 2610.64
finding a lot of cohesion so he's like

2608.319 --> 2612.56
doing a threat with fractal thinking

2610.64 --> 2615.68
type dick

2612.56 --> 2615.68
but in a way that's

2618.24 --> 2623.7599999999998
it almost feels a little alien to me

2620.24 --> 2626.0
it's so far off like how i go about and

2623.76 --> 2626.0
think

2626.64 --> 2631.56
but yeah at times it's really

2628.56 --> 2631.56
interesting

2634.8 --> 2639.2000000000003
but i'm not always in the mood for a

2636.24 --> 2639.2
quantum conscious

2646.4 --> 2650.8
what happened to rv

2648.8 --> 2655.3590000000004
oh yeah i meant already mentioned that

2650.8 --> 2655.3590000000004
there at 306 yeah he yesterday was just

2660.48 --> 2667.04
came on and he started basically

2662.96 --> 2667.04
[ __ ] on on other flat earthers

2668.24 --> 2674.24
getting also vognei

2670.88 --> 2674.2400000000002
and holier than thou

2674.4 --> 2676.82
like

2675.2 --> 2678.0789999999997
nitpicking and then

2676.82 --> 2680.56
[Music]

2678.079 --> 2682.5600000000004
it's it was terrible

2680.56 --> 2684.56
like at some point i really had to turn

2682.56 --> 2686.16
it off because

2684.56 --> 2688.24
well it was good that i turned it off

2686.16 --> 2690.319
because then through the skype chat i

2688.24 --> 2692.72
heard some of the other things he was

2690.319 --> 2692.72
saying

2694.64 --> 2696.8799999999997
and

2695.68 --> 2699.359
this just

2696.88 --> 2699.359
terrible

2700.24 --> 2706.319
so yeah that felt very much like another

2702.88 --> 2709.44
infighting wave it's that [ __ ]

2706.319 --> 2711.92
happened in 2016

2709.44 --> 2711.92
a lot

2715.599 --> 2720.48
and what rv was doing falls directly

2718.48 --> 2724.0
into that pattern it's just suddenly

2720.48 --> 2724.0
start attacking everybody

2726.8 --> 2732.6400000000003
russian vitz is who rv is gorzilla

2730.839 --> 2734.7999999999997
37.

2732.64 --> 2735.7599999999998
this is a

2734.8 --> 2739.119
guy

2735.76 --> 2739.119
i've never seen his face

2739.2 --> 2744.24
but he's been on the scene

2741.52 --> 2748.0
like with bigger players

2744.24 --> 2751.359
since 2015 so he was like one of the fir

2748.0 --> 2755.04
first wave flat earthers

2751.359 --> 2756.24
but i don't trust that guy at all

2755.04 --> 2759.2
never have

2756.24 --> 2762.319
but i'm not gonna like oh

2759.2 --> 2764.8799999999997
i just don't trust him it i

2762.319 --> 2764.88
i don't

2766.319 --> 2768.96
i just don't

2772.56 --> 2775.839
and that's intuitive

2779.76 --> 2784.1600000000003
like in general i don't like a guy oh i

2783.44 --> 2786.96
am

2784.16 --> 2789.359
one of the guys that you can trust oh

2786.96 --> 2791.2
really why haven't i ever seen your

2789.359 --> 2792.16
freaking face ever

2791.2 --> 2794.64
yeah

2792.16 --> 2796.7999999999997
there's other people too like that like

2794.64 --> 2799.2
rumpus

2796.8 --> 2799.2000000000003
you know

2799.28 --> 2803.8390000000004
i don't trust a guy that doesn't show

2801.04 --> 2807.92
his face on camera ever

2803.839 --> 2807.92
like oh you're afraid why

2810.16 --> 2815.04
if you're on god's side right

2813.04 --> 2818.16
and why are you afraid

2815.04 --> 2820.079
if you're so fanatically on god's side

2818.16 --> 2822.0
why are you afraid to show who you are

2820.079 --> 2824.7200000000003
why don't you why are you afraid to be

2822.0 --> 2824.72
identified

2825.04 --> 2829.16
it seems contradictive

2841.68 --> 2845.2799999999997
all right yeah tara 306 it's it's low

2844.319 --> 2848.319
blows

2845.28 --> 2851.0400000000004
and it's the [ __ ] that's really been a

2848.319 --> 2853.04
dra a drain and a drag on flat earth

2851.04 --> 2854.72
scene on the flatter scene for a long

2853.04 --> 2856.839
time because it's not the first time

2854.72 --> 2859.359
he's done that and

2856.839 --> 2863.2
others it's like something that seems to

2859.359 --> 2863.2
happen almost every year

2864.079 --> 2866.96
just

2864.88 --> 2868.48
suddenly oh everybody's not doing it

2866.96 --> 2870.4
good enough and oh i'm going to attack

2868.48 --> 2872.16
then i'm going to call them shields or

2870.4 --> 2874.64
going to get all paranoid about how

2872.16 --> 2877.359
they're secretly there to get keep or

2874.64 --> 2880.5589999999997
something nonsense

2877.359 --> 2883.2799999999997
what david weiss is a gatekeeper now

2880.559 --> 2885.52
because at some point he just kind of

2883.28 --> 2888.079
wildly speculate well maybe there's like

2885.52 --> 2890.319
another pond or another layer and there

2888.079 --> 2892.2000000000003
might be another sun in the moon oh my

2890.319 --> 2894.72
god that is so

2892.2 --> 2897.68
anti-christian to say

2894.72 --> 2900.319
like what are you [ __ ] dude

2897.68 --> 2903.1189999999997
are you actually [ __ ] that's like

2900.319 --> 2906.0
the dumbest accusation i've ever heard

2903.119 --> 2908.8
anybody made against david weiss

2906.0 --> 2912.52
seriously that's really freaking stupid

2908.8 --> 2912.52
thing to say it's

2937.92 --> 2944.8
right but also like oh he actually

2941.68 --> 2946.64
according to brian's logic

2944.8 --> 2948.6400000000003
i didn't see it myself but apparently he

2946.64 --> 2951.839
said like why aren't flood earthers

2948.64 --> 2954.72
talking more about sea

2951.839 --> 2956.7999999999997
like yeah why do you think

2954.72 --> 2959.2
because that's how you get banned oh you

2956.8 --> 2961.119
want all the flat earthers to get stupid

2959.2 --> 2963.52
and get banned

2961.119 --> 2963.52
why

2963.92 --> 2969.2000000000003
that seems like a real

2966.0 --> 2969.2
chill move to me

2969.599 --> 2972.7200000000003
i mean it

2970.72 --> 2974.9599999999996
i wouldn't say like oh don't talk about

2972.72 --> 2976.72
it no no no don't talk no hey if you

2974.96 --> 2980.4
want to talk about it sure but why would

2976.72 --> 2985.0789999999997
you say why aren't you talking about it

2980.4 --> 2985.079
when it's blatantly obvious what happens

2985.2 --> 2989.2799999999997
what you just want to get everybody

2986.96 --> 2989.28
banned

2993.92 --> 2998.92
i shop at y's supermarket okay

3016.96 --> 3019.28
all right

3020.24 --> 3024.72
also just the whole

3022.4 --> 3028.88
the rv the whole reasoning behind it

3024.72 --> 3031.1189999999997
like oh i'm such a strict christian

3028.88 --> 3034.7200000000003
and because david wise said that there

3031.119 --> 3038.96
might be more suns and moons no no

3034.72 --> 3038.9599999999996
no i have to throw him down

3039.52 --> 3043.52
oh okay but at the same time you're

3041.68 --> 3044.72
perfectly fine with a lot of other

3043.52 --> 3046.88
people

3044.72 --> 3049.4399999999996
that engage in typical actions that

3046.88 --> 3051.6800000000003
aren't exactly recommended among

3049.44 --> 3053.28
christianity either

3051.68 --> 3054.3999999999996
now i have no problem with that

3053.28 --> 3056.96
personally

3054.4 --> 3058.96
right like for example crow triple seven

3056.96 --> 3061.119
who's constantly

3058.96 --> 3065.119
engaging in gematria oh you think

3061.119 --> 3066.0
gematra is a very christian thing nuya

3065.119 --> 3069.04
no

3066.0 --> 3071.119
no it's not

3069.04 --> 3073.7599999999998
but it's complicated

3071.119 --> 3073.76
because like

3073.839 --> 3078.68
is gematria or astrology

3076.48 --> 3082.76
really anti-christian or is that

3078.68 --> 3082.7599999999998
anti-priest christian

3083.2 --> 3086.0789999999997
right

3084.0 --> 3088.16
it just gets complicated it just seems

3086.079 --> 3090.4
like he's ha he has double standards and

3088.16 --> 3091.68
he just is like randomly attacking

3090.4 --> 3094.079
people for

3091.68 --> 3097.04
blatantly idiotic reasons

3094.079 --> 3099.2000000000003
stupid

3097.04 --> 3103.599
and i said something about it

3099.2 --> 3103.5989999999997
in chat and got banned for it

3103.839 --> 3109.119
and i didn't even like

3105.839 --> 3111.44
say it trollishly

3109.119 --> 3113.359
and then eventually i

3111.44 --> 3116.079
did get trollish

3113.359 --> 3118.24
and then like took my sock account my

3116.079 --> 3119.92
singular sock account

3118.24 --> 3121.68
and just put it down exactly what i

3119.92 --> 3123.359
thought of him was of course banned two

3121.68 --> 3125.2799999999997
seconds later

3123.359 --> 3128.72
it's just like dude what the hell is

3125.28 --> 3128.7200000000003
your [ __ ] problem man

3135.839 --> 3139.839
i mean

3137.28 --> 3142.0
i don't do that

3139.839 --> 3142.96
now i might be a bit of an exception

3142.0 --> 3145.76
right

3142.96 --> 3147.44
i have very strict rules about not like

3145.76 --> 3148.96
banning people just because they

3147.44 --> 3150.0
criticize me

3148.96 --> 3152.48
but

3150.0 --> 3153.92
why the hell isn't everybody else doing

3152.48 --> 3158.319
that as well

3153.92 --> 3160.96
like this guy's been at it for six years

3158.319 --> 3163.839
why are you still holding on to that

3160.96 --> 3166.319
really stupid way of going about your

3163.839 --> 3170.7999999999997
streams

3166.319 --> 3173.7599999999998
after six years man

3170.8 --> 3173.76
a waste of time

3178.96 --> 3182.4
especially against brian

3182.8 --> 3186.76
wait which brian

3196.88 --> 3200.88
hello by the way mick 13 and

3201.839 --> 3206.0789999999997
but you mean brian's logic

3204.24 --> 3208.3999999999996
yeah because brian's logic is like

3206.079 --> 3211.28
pretty defiantly like no i'm not a

3208.4 --> 3211.28
christian like that

3212.88 --> 3218.48
it's a defiant irishman

3215.68 --> 3220.24
but i do respect that and he he does

3218.48 --> 3223.92
respect

3220.24 --> 3226.24
good nature he does respect good things

3223.92 --> 3229.599
from christians and that's very cool

3226.24 --> 3234.04
he's not like really allergic to it

3229.599 --> 3234.04
and so then i can deal with him

3246.64 --> 3249.64
what

3254.48 --> 3259.119
oh godzilla is leaving again

3257.2 --> 3264.68
all right yeah good luck

3259.119 --> 3264.6800000000003
with work thanks for popping by in chat

3268.96 --> 3274.079
maybe rv wasn't having any new content

3271.52 --> 3276.72
yeah well obviously

3274.079 --> 3278.88
but is that a good reason to then just

3276.72 --> 3284.5989999999997
like oh i don't have any subject for

3278.88 --> 3284.599
today well let's just attack people

3295.119 --> 3298.96
like people that

3297.04 --> 3299.92
don't deserve it

3298.96 --> 3301.839
i mean

3299.92 --> 3303.64
i'm not saying that david wise is a

3301.839 --> 3310.5589999999997
perfect

3303.64 --> 3312.24
[Music]

3310.559 --> 3315.28
and he is

3312.24 --> 3318.16
like engaged he actually does a lot of

3315.28 --> 3320.2400000000002
things he is a bit of he has ambition

3318.16 --> 3323.7599999999998
and that's good that's that's kind of

3320.24 --> 3326.3999999999996
what we're missing on average

3323.76 --> 3328.88
right he's not perfect i've been

3326.4 --> 3330.88
criticizing him over his

3328.88 --> 3332.88
physicality assumption bias of the

3330.88 --> 3335.359
celestials even though he's not always

3332.88 --> 3337.359
like hardcore double down on that but in

3335.359 --> 3339.839
his explanation he always goes back to

3337.359 --> 3342.48
oh he listens to the sun and blah blah

3339.839 --> 3344.96
over the disc

3342.48 --> 3347.92
and i've always like for years because i

3344.96 --> 3349.76
started that like four or five years ago

3347.92 --> 3351.2000000000003
like no no it's holographic it doesn't

3349.76 --> 3353.119
have a distance

3351.2 --> 3355.2
and i think maybe he just doesn't get it

3353.119 --> 3357.119
or he just doesn't want to

3355.2 --> 3359.5989999999997
get into that he just wants to hold on

3357.119 --> 3361.6800000000003
to the old explanation

3359.599 --> 3364.96
doesn't make him evil

3361.68 --> 3367.04
or an unpurposed gatekeeper it just

3364.96 --> 3369.119
doesn't seem like that at all

3367.04 --> 3371.2799999999997
he's just doing his thing he's trying to

3369.119 --> 3375.599
explain it

3371.28 --> 3377.44
how he sees it and he is also like

3375.599 --> 3379.599
kind of like what i'm doing like trying

3377.44 --> 3381.28
to figure out the unknowns like what

3379.599 --> 3384.48
could it be what could it be and that's

3381.28 --> 3387.8390000000004
a very interesting thing to do

3384.48 --> 3391.04
so i don't see anything malevolent

3387.839 --> 3393.44
coming from david weiss he's not perfect

3391.04 --> 3395.359
though he's not like oh my god he's

3393.44 --> 3399.839
impervious everything he says is just

3395.359 --> 3404.0
gold no no no but he is a cool guy

3399.839 --> 3407.599
and i will never forget

3404.0 --> 3407.599
he actually was the guy

3408.24 --> 3413.359
to give me the push in the back to start

3411.359 --> 3415.52
live streaming if it wasn't for david

3413.359 --> 3416.799
wise i would have probably never started

3415.52 --> 3420.0
doing my

3416.799 --> 3420.0
flat earth talk shows

3420.48 --> 3425.44
right like nathan oakley really

3423.119 --> 3426.559
motivated me to do a flat earth early

3425.44 --> 3428.7200000000003
bird show

3426.559 --> 3431.2000000000003
david weiss was the one that really kind

3428.72 --> 3432.799
of like yeah man you can do it we need

3431.2 --> 3434.8799999999997
you

3432.799 --> 3437.44
we need you i think you're you're smart

3434.88 --> 3439.2000000000003
you got good ideas it's interesting do

3437.44 --> 3441.599
do start doing streams it's okay we'll

3439.2 --> 3442.8799999999997
support you like he did that

3441.599 --> 3445.28
like

3442.88 --> 3446.6400000000003
right that's david weiss

3445.28 --> 3448.96
that did that

3446.64 --> 3451.52
and i will never forget it it's it's

3448.96 --> 3456.119
ingrained in my memory like he did that

3451.52 --> 3456.119
i will always be thankful for that

3461.839 --> 3466.4
a thousand sixty freaking shows yeah

3464.16 --> 3469.68
yeah

3466.4 --> 3469.6800000000003
yeah i'm just keeping going

3473.28 --> 3476.96
high impact flix brain that brian's oh

3476.079 --> 3481.0
okay

3476.96 --> 3481.0
i don't know who that is sorry

3496.64 --> 3500.8799999999997
right but again i didn't like i kind of

3498.96 --> 3503.52
had it on in the background and i just

3500.88 --> 3506.319
heard that he was whining a lot

3503.52 --> 3508.48
and then i zone out because i don't care

3506.319 --> 3510.319
for the details of who and what he's

3508.48 --> 3513.44
accusing and how it's wrong it's just

3510.319 --> 3515.68
like oh no he's at it again

3513.44 --> 3518.079
what when somebody is like in a drunken

3515.68 --> 3519.68
stupor [ __ ] talking on the street

3518.079 --> 3522.4
yelling at people

3519.68 --> 3524.8799999999997
are you gonna listen in all i need to

3522.4 --> 3527.119
hear exactly what he's saying

3524.88 --> 3528.88
no no you don't it's just like oh god

3527.119 --> 3531.76
the guy is editing you're not gonna

3528.88 --> 3532.6400000000003
listen to what he says

3531.76 --> 3535.6800000000003
right

3532.64 --> 3538.0789999999997
and in that sense i don't listen

3535.68 --> 3540.48
i didn't really listen to rv when he did

3538.079 --> 3543.04
that it was only until when he brought

3540.48 --> 3545.2
up david wise and how unchristian he was

3543.04 --> 3547.52
that's when i'm like what

3545.2 --> 3549.5989999999997
is that [ __ ]

3547.52 --> 3552.4
what are you doing that's when i started

3549.599 --> 3552.4
to pay attention

3553.44 --> 3556.44
uh

3558.319 --> 3564.48
never knew that yeah no david wise like

3560.96 --> 3566.16
was a real confidence booster in 2015

3564.48 --> 3569.04
for everybody

3566.16 --> 3569.04
and 16.

3569.119 --> 3573.76
like him and patricia

3570.839 --> 3576.5589999999997
steer and others as well

3573.76 --> 3579.599
but they all go yeah funnily enough in

3576.559 --> 3580.7200000000003
the way antonio subarats also but then

3579.599 --> 3582.7200000000003
yeah

3580.72 --> 3585.359
he got in a relationship with patricia

3582.72 --> 3587.5989999999997
and after that it was just kaboom and he

3585.359 --> 3589.5989999999997
just turned

3587.599 --> 3591.04
and he turned on me too because i kind

3589.599 --> 3595.44
of

3591.04 --> 3595.44
i refused to like [ __ ] on patricia

3595.52 --> 3599.28
right but yeah antonio super at the time

3597.92 --> 3601.6800000000003
was also

3599.28 --> 3604.6400000000003
kind of helpful

3601.68 --> 3606.48
he offered technical help too

3604.64 --> 3608.64
right but david weiss was really like

3606.48 --> 3610.4
the guy he would really

3608.64 --> 3613.1189999999997
try to boost your confidence because

3610.4 --> 3615.92
back then it was scary it was really

3613.119 --> 3619.119
scary to come out of a flat earth closet

3615.92 --> 3621.52
like that it was actually like really

3619.119 --> 3622.799
scary because we didn't know what was

3621.52 --> 3623.92
gonna happen

3622.799 --> 3626.559
i

3623.92 --> 3628.559
me personally probably not everybody out

3626.559 --> 3631.44
but i actually thought like if i'm gonna

3628.559 --> 3633.52
do this they're gonna kill me

3631.44 --> 3635.359
like i really thought that it was really

3633.52 --> 3637.119
scary to me

3635.359 --> 3640.48
and he just like

3637.119 --> 3642.7200000000003
nah it's okay dude

3640.48 --> 3644.16
just do it you got the talent you can do

3642.72 --> 3647.04
it

3644.16 --> 3649.04
and that really like give me gave me the

3647.04 --> 3652.079
nudge that i needed to get over that

3649.04 --> 3654.72
threshold and just do it

3652.079 --> 3656.559
and i'll never forget it

3654.72 --> 3659.359
yeah i really enjoyed antonio in the

3656.559 --> 3662.3190000000004
beginning i i agree it was awesome it

3659.359 --> 3662.319
was fascinating

3662.96 --> 3668.48
and the guy is

3664.799 --> 3668.48
really smart he's just

3668.799 --> 3677.48
once his ego got grip of the whole thing

3672.0 --> 3677.48
it never really let go it's just too bad

3693.28 --> 3697.44
yeah exactly matthew i know right

3697.599 --> 3700.839
it's ridiculous

3712.4 --> 3717.2000000000003
okay yeah well i don't know about i

3715.039 --> 3719.44
don't it all depends matthew it just

3717.2 --> 3722.799
depends on what the guys

3719.44 --> 3722.799
that follow him want

3722.88 --> 3727.52
and there's a lot of dissatisfaction in

3725.68 --> 3729.359
general going about it's not just flat

3727.52 --> 3730.799
earth in general and i think that he's

3729.359 --> 3732.5589999999997
just kind of like trying to play into

3730.799 --> 3735.92
that because i saw everybody squirting

3732.559 --> 3738.3190000000004
and chat like yeah yeah go after him

3735.92 --> 3740.64
and that wasn't like baller trolls or

3738.319 --> 3743.52
anything that was like

3740.64 --> 3747.5989999999997
people in there

3743.52 --> 3747.599
so they were all very rowdy at the time

3748.24 --> 3752.64
but it like this is not the first time

3750.64 --> 3753.7599999999998
he's done anything like that

3752.64 --> 3755.7599999999998
okay

3753.76 --> 3758.48
i remember that

3755.76 --> 3759.599
periodically from russian fitz

3758.48 --> 3763.4
that's

3759.599 --> 3763.4
i don't trust him

3775.92 --> 3780.7200000000003
right yeah oh that was also a point it's

3778.24 --> 3782.799
a i thought it was a really great point

3780.72 --> 3784.8799999999997
for me to make in the chat i said it

3782.799 --> 3786.4
before i got banned

3784.88 --> 3789.4
and that is like

3786.4 --> 3792.96
what are you blabbering about secret

3789.4 --> 3796.079
societies are called symbols oh we have

3792.96 --> 3798.7200000000003
to look at the hand signs to identify

3796.079 --> 3800.559
who is part of the secret system

3798.72 --> 3803.359
or you could just read the papers where

3800.559 --> 3804.2400000000002
they just say it

3803.359 --> 3806.88
right

3804.24 --> 3809.4399999999996
what do you mean secret societies what

3806.88 --> 3812.2400000000002
secret societies are you talking about

3809.44 --> 3815.039
there is no more secret societies

3812.24 --> 3817.9199999999996
they've all come out of the closet now

3815.039 --> 3818.96
they're overt societies they're like

3817.92 --> 3820.88
yeah

3818.96 --> 3822.7200000000003
we're here to take you over we're here

3820.88 --> 3825.119
to take your freedom we're here to

3822.72 --> 3826.24
enslave your mind and make you kill

3825.119 --> 3827.599
yourself

3826.24 --> 3830.0
yeah that's

3827.599 --> 3832.1600000000003
what secret society they're not secret

3830.0 --> 3834.72
anymore why are you still seating

3832.16 --> 3837.52
paranoia like oh we have to uncover the

3834.72 --> 3840.72
secret people like dude they're freaking

3837.52 --> 3842.799
out in the open all of them all of them

3840.72 --> 3845.839
are out in the open

3842.799 --> 3849.2
what are you blabbering about

3845.839 --> 3849.2
why don't you get with the times

3850.88 --> 3854.799
i thought that was a really good point

3852.24 --> 3857.2
to make because it's true

3854.799 --> 3859.599
like really do you have to like oh i

3857.2 --> 3862.24
have to look at the hand signs and the

3859.599 --> 3864.079
codes and like what badge they're

3862.24 --> 3864.9599999999996
wearing over here if they're wearing a

3864.079 --> 3866.48
ring

3864.96 --> 3869.599
to know

3866.48 --> 3872.48
whether they are part of like the well

3869.599 --> 3874.4
sort of illuminati conspiracy control

3872.48 --> 3877.039
structure no

3874.4 --> 3879.6800000000003
you know now it's very easy to tell and

3877.039 --> 3883.039
most of them literally just

3879.68 --> 3886.48
are overt about it they just say it

3883.039 --> 3889.599
they just put it out in documents

3886.48 --> 3892.88
that are not being withheld anymore

3889.599 --> 3894.1600000000003
it's just said it's like no more secrets

3892.88 --> 3895.76
they've come out of the closet they're

3894.16 --> 3897.2
not secret anymore they're just

3895.76 --> 3900.4
societies

3897.2 --> 3900.3999999999996
overt societies

3901.119 --> 3905.88
anyway i'd love to hear your thought on

3902.88 --> 3905.88
that

3928.0 --> 3932.68
hello theater a lego beach

3938.559 --> 3943.3590000000004
no i have not heard ballers talk about

3940.48 --> 3946.559
that then again i don't really

3943.359 --> 3948.799
pay too much attention to what

3946.559 --> 3950.88
how they try to screw around it's only

3948.799 --> 3955.44
when they tried to snow me under that

3950.88 --> 3955.44
[ __ ] that they're like okay i i'll just

3955.599 --> 3962.2400000000002
get the reply i need so i can just

3959.28 --> 3963.28
not be nagged about it anymore

3962.24 --> 3966.5589999999997
because

3963.28 --> 3970.48
the earth is flat it is there's no doubt

3966.559 --> 3973.76
about it there is no more options left

3970.48 --> 3976.4
spiritually physically mentally

3973.76 --> 3979.92
that could ever lead to the earth not

3976.4 --> 3983.6800000000003
being flat it is flat forever and it

3979.92 --> 3983.6800000000003
will never be different ever

3985.119 --> 3989.839
so i'm just not that interested even

3987.359 --> 3992.24
anymore i'm more interested in like what

3989.839 --> 3994.88
is it like what is it really there seems

3992.24 --> 3996.9599999999996
to be so many different

3994.88 --> 3999.359
assumptions and misunderstandings and

3996.96 --> 4001.2
misleadings built

3999.359 --> 4003.7599999999998
in its conception

4001.2 --> 4005.68
and even in the mind of people as they

4003.76 --> 4007.76
approach

4005.68 --> 4010.7599999999998
and try to work out what they think it

4007.76 --> 4010.76
is

4025.52 --> 4029.28
hey seeking star wars yeah they

4027.359 --> 4031.44
definitely failed hiding the fact it's

4029.28 --> 4033.28
flat but they couldn't hide it

4031.44 --> 4034.96
it's as soon as people could inform

4033.28 --> 4036.799
themselves and even

4034.96 --> 4039.359
by their own volition trained critical

4036.799 --> 4041.359
thinking it was kind of over

4039.359 --> 4044.0
because of the internet if the internet

4041.359 --> 4046.16
would have never come into being other

4044.0 --> 4049.16
disasters would have happened yeah they

4046.16 --> 4049.16
would

4050.0 --> 4053.28
and then perhaps

4051.44 --> 4055.68
it might have never come that far but it

4053.28 --> 4057.28
would like even before the internet

4055.68 --> 4059.5989999999997
there were like

4057.28 --> 4061.52
secret groups

4059.599 --> 4062.7200000000003
that are not in power but that would

4061.52 --> 4064.0
like

4062.72 --> 4067.68
talk about

4064.0 --> 4067.68
flat earth like flat earthers

4067.76 --> 4070.88
come in all ages

4071.52 --> 4075.599
and they don't get taken out

4074.079 --> 4077.92
right

4075.599 --> 4080.96
that's nonsense you only get taken out

4077.92 --> 4082.799
if you like try to bury yourself or like

4080.96 --> 4085.039
50 years ago you would try to bury

4082.799 --> 4087.359
yourself in a university and publish a

4085.039 --> 4088.4
really good paper then it would be a

4087.359 --> 4089.7599999999998
threat

4088.4 --> 4091.28
right

4089.76 --> 4093.2000000000003
as long as you just like hang around

4091.28 --> 4096.319
with your friends talk about flat earth

4093.2 --> 4098.08
and try to figure out what it is etc

4096.319 --> 4100.56
they don't care

4098.08 --> 4101.759
that's not a threat the only threat is

4100.56 --> 4104.64
that

4101.759 --> 4107.44
the entire public

4104.64 --> 4110.96
starts to move away from the

4107.44 --> 4115.678999999999
pre-designed railroad that they laid out

4110.96 --> 4115.679
in their long-term 200-year plan

4116.56 --> 4121.120000000001
that's the only thing they really see as

4118.159 --> 4124.3189999999995
a threat and for some reason

4121.12 --> 4126.799
that road led right through here

4124.319 --> 4129.1990000000005
led through flat earth

4126.799 --> 4131.44
i don't think anybody of them really

4129.199 --> 4134.3189999999995
wanted it to happen but they could not

4131.44 --> 4136.639999999999
find a way around it they had to go

4134.319 --> 4138.719
through that valley it was the only way

4136.64 --> 4139.679
through they had to come here at some

4138.719 --> 4142.88
point

4139.679 --> 4144.799
so they just kind of let it

4142.88 --> 4147.359
happen

4144.799 --> 4149.92
but at the same time look at how much

4147.359 --> 4153.359
they amped up the mind control and the

4149.92 --> 4156.08
bad programming and the mental derailing

4153.359 --> 4157.359
the gas lighting it's become much worse

4156.08 --> 4160.799
now

4157.359 --> 4163.04
it has for a while

4160.799 --> 4165.2789999999995
remember remember

4163.04 --> 4166.48
media narrative and all that

4165.279 --> 4169.6
from

4166.48 --> 4171.5199999999995
10 years ago remember that

4169.6 --> 4174.4800000000005
yeah it was bad here and there it was

4171.52 --> 4176.080000000001
like yeah you're stupid liar you know

4174.48 --> 4179.12
but

4176.08 --> 4180.96
now it's like

4179.12 --> 4183.5199999999995
psycho

4180.96 --> 4186.319
narratives are now really psycho in the

4183.52 --> 4188.56
mainstream 10 years ago it wasn't psycho

4186.319 --> 4191.6
yet it was not good

4188.56 --> 4194.080000000001
but it wasn't like completely like ah

4191.6 --> 4197.04
die in your mind i'm gonna kill your

4194.08 --> 4199.44
mind with these crazy ass contradictions

4197.04 --> 4200.719
in your face that i'm gonna forbid you

4199.44 --> 4202.4
to question

4200.719 --> 4205.28
because then you're going to be called a

4202.4 --> 4206.239
nazi or whatever [ __ ] even though they

4205.28 --> 4208.48
are like

4206.239 --> 4211.44
blatantly

4208.48 --> 4214.159
propaganda arm of the nazi system

4211.44 --> 4214.159
blatantly

4214.8 --> 4220.400000000001
right so that has happened

4217.28 --> 4222.719
but again the road laid out those 200

4220.4 --> 4225.12
years ago the big

4222.719 --> 4227.28
illuminati plan might to take over the

4225.12 --> 4229.5199999999995
world

4227.28 --> 4231.679
it was always gonna lead through flat

4229.52 --> 4234.4800000000005
earth i think

4231.679 --> 4239.12
they didn't know how to get past that

4234.48 --> 4239.12
point without letting it just open up

4239.84 --> 4244.8
that's what i think i have no physical

4242.239 --> 4247.04
evidence for this it's just a really

4244.8 --> 4248.4800000000005
strong hunch

4247.04 --> 4250.239
and i'm not the only one that thinks

4248.48 --> 4252.799999999999
that i think mark sargent also thinks

4250.239 --> 4254.239
like that i've heard him say things that

4252.8 --> 4257.2390000000005
really follow that same train of

4254.239 --> 4257.239
thinking

4262.0 --> 4266.88
complete secret sickle and flaker yeah

4267.6 --> 4272.52
baking bread nice homemade bread awesome

4274.08 --> 4277.6
right anyway yeah it's turning out to be

4275.92 --> 4278.8
a pretty good show i feel a lot better

4277.6 --> 4284.360000000001
right now

4278.8 --> 4284.360000000001
i'm at 80 anyway be back in two minutes

4371.92 --> 4374.92
hmm

4395.76 --> 4400.96
okay make 13 and i don't know exactly

4398.48 --> 4404.5199999999995

4400.96 --> 4404.52
oh hold on

4811.52 --> 4816.8

4818.32 --> 4824.4
holy [ __ ] that helped

4820.88 --> 4824.400000000001
yeah that was my healer calling

4825.04 --> 4828.88
it's funny because

4826.719 --> 4830.08
i haven't spoken to him

4828.88 --> 4833.56
in a while

4830.08 --> 4836.239
and he always managed to pinpoint down

4833.56 --> 4838.2390000000005
exactly when it happened

4836.239 --> 4840.638999999999
when the thing

4838.239 --> 4842.159
nagging me happened and he said like no

4840.639 --> 4845.679
it's monday

4842.159 --> 4848.48
what monday what was monday oh yeah i

4845.679 --> 4850.8
had that stream with that

4848.48 --> 4853.759999999999
very triggering title that had by the

4850.8 --> 4855.92
way record views and apparently i got a

4853.76 --> 4858.08
whole bunch of aromantic

4855.92 --> 4861.4400000000005
garbage piled onto me that's been

4858.08 --> 4863.12
lingering ever since i was still 50

4861.44 --> 4864.159
myself

4863.12 --> 4866.5599999999995
though

4864.159 --> 4869.44
which is very good

4866.56 --> 4871.120000000001
but yeah he he removed the garbage

4869.44 --> 4874.5599999999995
sounds weird when i said it's this is

4871.12 --> 4877.679
all like spirit mechanics he removed

4874.56 --> 4880.719
their garbage and like immediately

4877.679 --> 4883.76
that tension that i was talking about

4880.719 --> 4885.04
it gone it's completely gone man i feel

4883.76 --> 4887.52
like yeah

4885.04 --> 4887.5199999999995
let's go

4887.6 --> 4890.639
let's go brandon

4891.199 --> 4893.44
ah

4894.239 --> 4899.678999999999
so yeah i'm back

4896.48 --> 4899.678999999999
that was my healer calling

4901.04 --> 4903.84
what's going on here

4917.12 --> 4922.719
people have a zombified brain right

4920.639 --> 4924.159000000001
well it's

4922.719 --> 4926.719
depression

4924.159 --> 4928.96
panic based surrenderism

4926.719 --> 4930.56
it's like i don't know what how to stop

4928.96 --> 4932.88
this i don't

4930.56 --> 4935.360000000001
feel i have enough confidence to do

4932.88 --> 4938.4800000000005
anything about this or to maintain

4935.36 --> 4940.0
myself in opposition of this so i'm just

4938.48 --> 4944.0
gonna surrender

4940.0 --> 4947.679
like a slave or a piece of cattle

4944.0 --> 4947.679
that knows it's gonna die

4947.92 --> 4952.32
like you're an expendable slave and they

4950.239 --> 4954.879999999999
know it but they don't know what else to

4952.32 --> 4956.719
do so it's like a like a mind control

4954.88 --> 4958.639
panic surrender and that's happening to

4956.719 --> 4962.08
a lot of people

4958.639 --> 4964.719
like that's why some people like

4962.08 --> 4966.0
like they they vaccinate their own

4964.719 --> 4968.8
children

4966.0 --> 4969.92
they get horrible effects some of them

4968.8 --> 4972.08
die

4969.92 --> 4974.2390000000005
and they keep on doing it like oh craig

4972.08 --> 4976.96
i'm gonna keep doing this i'm good

4974.239 --> 4979.44
that's literally like a death slave

4976.96 --> 4982.159
somebody that is completely

4979.44 --> 4984.08
lost control completely they have no

4982.159 --> 4987.04
more grip

4984.08 --> 4990.08
they don't know what they cannot face

4987.04 --> 4992.719
that the entire world turned out to be

4990.08 --> 4994.88
absolutely evil

4992.719 --> 4999.44
the control system they cannot handle it

4994.88 --> 5001.36
so they surrender to death effectively

4999.44 --> 5003.919999999999
it's a fair effect

5001.36 --> 5007.199
when they can't handle anything about

5003.92 --> 5011.12
the reality then they surrender

5007.199 --> 5013.36
their cognition and their control

5011.12 --> 5015.76
to that evil

5013.36 --> 5017.28
out of sheer panic and fear

5015.76 --> 5020.400000000001
and then they end up just killing

5017.28 --> 5022.719
themselves it's totally insane

5020.4 --> 5025.599999999999
i think a lot of like the more extreme

5022.719 --> 5027.679
sjws that you get to see on cameras

5025.6 --> 5029.04
acting like complete nut cases they're

5027.679 --> 5031.1990000000005
like that too

5029.04 --> 5036.12
that that effect

5031.199 --> 5036.12
is what put them in that place

5044.639 --> 5049.8
anyway

5046.0 --> 5049.8
anybody still listening

5058.0 --> 5061.0
right

5075.84 --> 5078.96
what are you guys talking about

5080.639 --> 5085.76
you can't even listen for more than five

5082.719 --> 5088.0
minutes what coming for oh okay

5085.76 --> 5088.0
right

5088.56 --> 5091.76
right well it's it's like

5094.4 --> 5100.159
like a whiny old lady

5097.36 --> 5103.159
right it's just very annoying and

5100.159 --> 5103.159
ineffective

5118.0 --> 5122.88
right yeah make and 13

5120.88 --> 5125.4400000000005
make 13 ants

5122.88 --> 5128.08
but yeah to be fair

5125.44 --> 5130.638999999999
you know i've had that

5128.08 --> 5133.44
when i was younger and i was kind of

5130.639 --> 5137.36
faced with what the system really is

5133.44 --> 5137.36
i had that effect i would be like

5137.679 --> 5140.88
no

5139.199 --> 5141.678999999999
it can't be

5140.88 --> 5143.52
no

5141.679 --> 5146.0
i don't believe you

5143.52 --> 5148.719
i'm gonna defend this it can't be that

5146.0 --> 5150.96
bad it can't be it can't be it can't be

5148.719 --> 5152.719
i would literally chant it it can't be

5150.96 --> 5156.0
it can't be it can't be

5152.719 --> 5157.76
right so i totally get

5156.0 --> 5159.28
how that's happening

5157.76 --> 5160.4800000000005
i understand it

5159.28 --> 5161.5199999999995
it's

5160.48 --> 5164.32
really

5161.52 --> 5166.639
really painful

5164.32 --> 5168.4
it has to be in order for yourself to

5166.639 --> 5171.92
get to that point where you literally

5168.4 --> 5171.92
surrender your cognition

5174.239 --> 5178.48
because you surrender it basically

5176.48 --> 5180.159
to avoid

5178.48 --> 5183.5199999999995
sensing the pain

5180.159 --> 5187.599999999999
from the realization you lose your mind

5183.52 --> 5187.6
because of the pain of the truth

5187.679 --> 5192.4800000000005
aromantic demonic yeah

5190.4 --> 5194.719
yeah it is

5192.48 --> 5197.759999999999
but it's all like it's

5194.719 --> 5199.6
understandable weakness in ways though

5197.76 --> 5201.92
but that's why from

5199.6 --> 5205.04
as you're a young kid especially in this

5201.92 --> 5207.4400000000005
age your parents should be

5205.04 --> 5210.239
helping you weaponize

5207.44 --> 5211.678999999999
helping you defend constantly helping

5210.239 --> 5214.638999999999
you

5211.679 --> 5217.12
to learn how to defend yourself mentally

5214.639 --> 5218.36
against the invasiveness the ever

5217.12 --> 5221.04
increasing

5218.36 --> 5222.4
invasiveness of the world and media

5221.04 --> 5223.199
especially

5222.4 --> 5225.5199999999995
right

5223.199 --> 5226.719
you should have

5225.52 --> 5228.080000000001
media

5226.719 --> 5231.52
class

5228.08 --> 5233.04
as a little kid like

5231.52 --> 5235.280000000001
ask questions like what do you think

5233.04 --> 5236.88
about the tv right you think everything

5235.28 --> 5237.599999999999
on the tv is good

5236.88 --> 5240.0
no

5237.6 --> 5240.96
what do you think is bad why is it bad

5240.0 --> 5243.92
right

5240.96 --> 5246.4
they have to have moral development and

5243.92 --> 5248.96
micro confrontations with it even not

5246.4 --> 5252.239
sjw crap

5248.96 --> 5254.08
exactly the opposite of that

5252.239 --> 5255.919999999999
critical thinking inquiry like thinking

5254.08 --> 5257.6
about what are you watching

5255.92 --> 5260.2390000000005
you think this is good

5257.6 --> 5263.4400000000005
they should all have training for that

5260.239 --> 5265.04
because if you don't then you grow up

5263.44 --> 5267.199
leaning on things you shouldn't be

5265.04 --> 5269.199
leaning on and then when it suddenly

5267.199 --> 5270.719
gets pulled from underneath you you're

5269.199 --> 5271.839999999999
like ah

5270.719 --> 5274.96
help

5271.84 --> 5277.92
help i don't know what to do

5274.96 --> 5281.12
i'm just gonna be a brain dead soldier

5277.92 --> 5282.8
for the system oh it's evil well then

5281.12 --> 5284.48
you're evil

5282.8 --> 5286.56
i don't care

5284.48 --> 5289.04
i'm gonna attack you

5286.56 --> 5291.280000000001
right they're gonna act like

5289.04 --> 5293.199
super stressed out agitated

5291.28 --> 5296.48
six-year-olds because that's the

5293.199 --> 5296.48
mechanism that are left

5297.199 --> 5301.04
that's also the time when they should

5299.04 --> 5304.48
have actually

5301.04 --> 5306.639
had that rebellion

5304.48 --> 5310.4
and social rebellion instinct like

5306.639 --> 5313.36
around six they should have

5310.4 --> 5315.5199999999995
should have had that re-routed

5313.36 --> 5317.28
right they're not just oh you're just a

5315.52 --> 5318.8
pointless rebeling

5317.28 --> 5320.48
but to actually

5318.8 --> 5322.8
make them realize that yeah that

5320.48 --> 5325.199
instinct has a purpose

5322.8 --> 5329.679
you're gonna need that

5325.199 --> 5332.48
so why don't you train it and guide it

5329.679 --> 5334.2390000000005
in the right direction

5332.48 --> 5336.959999999999
right

5334.239 --> 5338.638999999999
because then if you actually just are

5336.96 --> 5341.36
like confident

5338.639 --> 5341.36
rebellious

5341.6 --> 5346.8
good stable then you're not gonna run

5344.4 --> 5348.799999999999
into those panic moments like oh i don't

5346.8 --> 5351.52
know what to do anymore i'm just gonna

5348.8 --> 5353.84
be a mind control slave soldier for the

5351.52 --> 5355.1990000000005
for the beast

5353.84 --> 5357.92
you have to

5355.199 --> 5359.919999999999
teach that to your children how to

5357.92 --> 5362.2390000000005
defend themselves psychologically and

5359.92 --> 5364.56
how to prevent that from happening to

5362.239 --> 5367.28
not lean on things

5364.56 --> 5371.360000000001
and like count on them to be like that

5367.28 --> 5371.36
there as you think they are forever

5371.44 --> 5375.44
but to actually

5373.12 --> 5376.5599999999995
inquire as to what is it you're leaning

5375.44 --> 5378.5599999999995
on

5376.56 --> 5380.719
is that really a good thing to lean on

5378.56 --> 5382.159000000001
for the rest of your life

5380.719 --> 5384.8
they have to think about they have to be

5382.159 --> 5387.679
confronted about that at a young age

5384.8 --> 5392.4400000000005
before it's before they're already so

5387.679 --> 5392.4400000000005
tangled in you can't get them out again

5403.04 --> 5407.679
really

5405.04 --> 5409.6
really that's from the western that's

5407.679 --> 5412.159
fascinating i didn't know that

5409.6 --> 5413.4400000000005
i only know iremon

5412.159 --> 5415.36
through

5413.44 --> 5417.199
rudolf steiner

5415.36 --> 5419.04
because iroman

5417.199 --> 5420.719
is like

5419.04 --> 5422.639
rude of steiner in his spiritual

5420.719 --> 5425.04
cosmology split

5422.639 --> 5428.400000000001
satan up in lucifer and ironman where

5425.04 --> 5430.239
lucifer is the seducer the defiant

5428.4 --> 5432.839999999999
the arrogant

5430.239 --> 5436.159
the wannabe

5432.84 --> 5438.2390000000005
god every man is the depressor the

5436.159 --> 5441.04
destroyer

5438.239 --> 5442.638999999999
death incarnate

5441.04 --> 5445.92
the one

5442.639 --> 5445.92
that takes away

5446.48 --> 5451.599999999999
so that's how i know ariman

5449.12 --> 5453.08
i didn't know that was from that it's

5451.6 --> 5457.120000000001
also in

5453.08 --> 5457.12
zoroastrianism that's fascinating

5458.48 --> 5460.718999999999
huh

5460.8 --> 5464.88
i don't know a lot about that by the way

5463.159 --> 5467.36
zoroastrianism

5464.88 --> 5468.88
and i recognize the name but don't know

5467.36 --> 5471.88
much about it

5468.88 --> 5471.88
hmm

5485.36 --> 5489.36
right so yeah and also i like to

5488.08 --> 5491.44
personally

5489.36 --> 5493.04
split that up because of good reasons

5491.44 --> 5495.28
you see

5493.04 --> 5497.36
lucifer the seducer the arrogant the

5495.28 --> 5498.159
wannabe little god

5497.36 --> 5500.239
is

5498.159 --> 5501.44
devilish

5500.239 --> 5503.12
is

5501.44 --> 5504.638999999999
prolifically

5503.12 --> 5507.84
devilish

5504.639 --> 5510.400000000001
arimon the destroyer the killer

5507.84 --> 5513.1990000000005
the reaper is demonic

5510.4 --> 5515.839999999999
it it also

5513.199 --> 5518.0
is split up like that because it's very

5515.84 --> 5521.6
different character profiles i mean they

5518.0 --> 5524.239
mix up and a lot of well people that do

5521.6 --> 5526.159000000001
engage with luciferian behavior

5524.239 --> 5528.879999999999
eventually kind of

5526.159 --> 5530.638999999999
accidentally or or on purpose end up

5528.88 --> 5534.159000000001
aromantic

5530.639 --> 5534.159000000001
it usually becomes a mix

5534.239 --> 5537.919999999999
but on average when you're younger it's

5536.159 --> 5539.759999999999
more likely you're being seduced by

5537.92 --> 5541.76
lucifer and then at the end it's more

5539.76 --> 5543.360000000001
likely you'll be seduced by arrowman

5541.76 --> 5546.639
you'll kind of give up

5543.36 --> 5547.599999999999
you feel weak or discouraged etc

5546.639 --> 5551.12
right

5547.6 --> 5555.04
and i think it's a very important

5551.12 --> 5557.04
conscious split within the pattern

5555.04 --> 5559.199
pattern of how things work

5557.04 --> 5562.08
to realize that and to not just put it

5559.199 --> 5562.96
all on one heap of satan

5562.08 --> 5564.4
i mean

5562.96 --> 5567.36
you can

5564.4 --> 5569.28
for a quick discussion

5567.36 --> 5572.04
or when you're gonna talk about like

5569.28 --> 5574.8
specifics i think it's better to

5572.04 --> 5575.92
compartmentalize satan into iriman and

5574.8 --> 5577.52
lucifer

5575.92 --> 5579.52
because they are very different in

5577.52 --> 5583.1990000000005
nature their spirit

5579.52 --> 5583.1990000000005
the effect is very different

5586.56 --> 5593.360000000001
it's a dualistic i think god and ariman

5590.0 --> 5593.36
are equal what no

5595.76 --> 5600.2390000000005
no everyone is

5598.32 --> 5603.28
is it's a force

5600.239 --> 5605.759999999999
you could consider them like

5603.28 --> 5608.719
the little g

5605.76 --> 5612.719
appointed by the creator like they are

5608.719 --> 5615.52
the conditions they are the things that

5612.719 --> 5617.12
that come that are like a permanent

5615.52 --> 5619.76
presence

5617.12 --> 5620.5599999999995
through the very nature of the design

5619.76 --> 5623.52
they

5620.56 --> 5625.679
can get grip so they were meant to be

5623.52 --> 5630.080000000001
able to do that

5625.679 --> 5633.12
they might have been appointed by god

5630.08 --> 5635.04
the designer not because they were good

5633.12 --> 5637.599999999999
but because they might have been

5635.04 --> 5639.36
necessary

5637.6 --> 5642.8
they might have been necessary to be

5639.36 --> 5644.4
able to do that in order for

5642.8 --> 5648.96
people to develop

5644.4 --> 5648.96
and flourish and spiritually ascend etc

5649.28 --> 5653.32
to to create purpose

5666.08 --> 5669.96
who are you talking to

5688.96 --> 5693.4
are you talking to orange samples

5700.32 --> 5705.28
human smell

5701.84 --> 5705.28
yeah we smell but

5705.36 --> 5709.28
but

5706.8 --> 5711.4400000000005
how do you smell right

5709.28 --> 5715.0
it all depends on what you eat

5711.44 --> 5715.0
how you feel

5716.08 --> 5723.44
the energies you have in you

5720.0 --> 5724.4
if it's all disjointed

5723.44 --> 5726.48
bad

5724.4 --> 5728.96
you're gonna stink

5726.48 --> 5731.839999999999
if you're very stressed stress

5728.96 --> 5735.84
officially has its own smell

5731.84 --> 5738.08
animals literally smell fear and stress

5735.84 --> 5738.08
right

5738.4 --> 5743.5199999999995
and if you eat garbage that's not

5740.56 --> 5744.400000000001
natural it's gonna make you stinky too

5743.52 --> 5746.639
right

5744.4 --> 5747.599999999999
i don't smell

5746.639 --> 5750.0
like

5747.6 --> 5750.0
really

5750.639 --> 5756.32
i do not stink i guess that's my elven

5753.36 --> 5758.799999999999
nature or something but it's also my

5756.32 --> 5758.799999999999
diet

5758.88 --> 5762.2390000000005
right

5760.08 --> 5764.4
and i even drink beer

5762.239 --> 5765.678999999999
and still i don't smell

5764.4 --> 5767.839999999999
now

5765.679 --> 5769.36
20 years ago

5767.84 --> 5772.719
i would smell

5769.36 --> 5772.719
i didn't eat organic yet

5773.199 --> 5776.239
and

5774.4 --> 5777.44
then when i would drink i would really

5776.239 --> 5779.759999999999
be like

5777.44 --> 5781.44
i smell like

5779.76 --> 5785.6
like

5781.44 --> 5788.719
beer or whatever you i would smell now i

5785.6 --> 5788.719
don't smell anymore

5789.36 --> 5793.36
i mean i smell like something it just

5791.679 --> 5796.84
doesn't stink

5793.36 --> 5800.4
i never get complaints from people

5796.84 --> 5803.679
ever like i even like i need to ask them

5800.4 --> 5804.638999999999
because it's never brought up

5803.679 --> 5806.8
now

5804.639 --> 5808.639
on the other hand

5806.8 --> 5811.84
seven years ago when i kind of just

5808.639 --> 5816.400000000001
moved in here i did have smell issues

5811.84 --> 5818.400000000001
because i was super super stressed out

5816.4 --> 5820.879999999999
because of the breakup with my ex and

5818.4 --> 5823.28
yeah when i'm like totally miserable

5820.88 --> 5825.04
then i do start to stink it's just pure

5823.28 --> 5826.639
stress hormone

5825.04 --> 5829.36
even though i'd still be eating pretty

5826.639 --> 5830.400000000001
healthy i would stink

5829.36 --> 5831.92
i don't

5830.4 --> 5833.759999999999
i don't do that i don't have that

5831.92 --> 5836.159
anymore

5833.76 --> 5840.52
i'm very happy about my smell is very

5836.159 --> 5840.5199999999995
sensitive by the way so

5841.36 --> 5845.28
like i do

5843.04 --> 5848.239
like when somebody stinks i it's very

5845.28 --> 5850.719
annoying to me and i hate

5848.239 --> 5853.44
like chemical perfumes i really love

5850.719 --> 5854.4
them yeah

5853.44 --> 5857.28
gives me

5854.4 --> 5857.28
physical headache

5861.92 --> 5867.8
okay all right samples you can get the

5864.56 --> 5867.8
[ __ ] out

5869.6 --> 5873.92
elven nature

5871.76 --> 5876.0
i thought that was a joke

5873.92 --> 5877.4400000000005
said about you actually consider

5876.0 --> 5880.159
yourself alvin

5877.44 --> 5881.678999999999
well what is it where did that concept

5880.159 --> 5885.04
came from

5881.679 --> 5885.04
metal slugs cockatril

5886.719 --> 5890.56
what if elves

5889.119 --> 5893.5199999999995
were just

5890.56 --> 5895.76
like humans like humans and they were

5893.52 --> 5897.84
just here

5895.76 --> 5900.08
and then yeah if you kind of like keep

5897.84 --> 5902.8
cross breeding then you only have half

5900.08 --> 5902.8
elves left

5902.88 --> 5908.08
and then some of them may be a little

5905.04 --> 5910.4
bit more elven in nature and others be

5908.08 --> 5913.6
more human in age like i don't know what

5910.4 --> 5916.0
elves really are

5913.6 --> 5918.2390000000005
i'd like to think of myself as one i

5916.0 --> 5922.04
really resonate with

5918.239 --> 5922.04
the concept of elves

5930.159 --> 5934.96
and literally i have an elven name

5933.679 --> 5936.2390000000005
it's like that

5934.96 --> 5938.639
that

5936.239 --> 5939.599999999999
association and that

5938.639 --> 5941.92
love

5939.6 --> 5943.52
started at a very young age

5941.92 --> 5946.2390000000005
very young

5943.52 --> 5946.2390000000005
like at first

5946.96 --> 5951.639
right well they gave me the name

5955.84 --> 5960.2390000000005
and then at some point i asked like what

5957.679 --> 5960.2390000000005
is that name

5961.84 --> 5966.88
and then they told me that's based on

5964.639 --> 5968.719
elves from

5966.88 --> 5969.76
a certain

5968.719 --> 5972.08
book

5969.76 --> 5973.92
and then that's like the first book they

5972.08 --> 5976.32
read to me

5973.92 --> 5979.88
started with the hobbit and i was so

5976.32 --> 5979.88
thrilled by that

5980.159 --> 5983.5199999999995
very very deeply

5984.32 --> 5988.5599999999995
and yeah that's kind of stuck around

5992.08 --> 5997.44
and some yeah there's also mythologies

5995.199 --> 6000.08
like in germanic lore

5997.44 --> 6003.36
that also involves elves in which they

6000.08 --> 6005.92
are basically extra dimensional spirits

6003.36 --> 6008.96
well maybe there is something about that

6005.92 --> 6012.08
maybe my spirit or yeah

6008.96 --> 6014.2390000000005
has is partially entangled maybe i am

6012.08 --> 6017.92
partially an elven spirit i don't know

6014.239 --> 6017.919999999999
it gets a little weird

6018.639 --> 6022.400000000001
you prefer to be a sorcerer

6022.48 --> 6024.959999999999
okay

6027.119 --> 6033.5199999999995
well look elves and now we're getting a

6030.239 --> 6035.44
little silly but maybe not as silly as

6033.52 --> 6037.360000000001
you'd like to think

6035.44 --> 6038.799999999999
in dungeons and dragons

6037.36 --> 6041.44
systems

6038.8 --> 6042.56
elves have wizard

6041.44 --> 6046.719
as their

6042.56 --> 6046.719
like favorite class guess what

6049.04 --> 6053.04
i don't know

6050.56 --> 6055.1990000000005
but it's it's getting all mashed up now

6053.04 --> 6055.199
so

6063.52 --> 6068.639
what alvin

6065.36 --> 6071.639
like small nephilim throne

6068.639 --> 6071.639
thrindling

6071.679 --> 6078.32
around and such understanding

6074.96 --> 6081.84
the twin around the heavenly fle what

6078.32 --> 6081.84
the hell does that mean

6081.92 --> 6086.4
i have no idea what that means thomas

6084.639 --> 6089.84
our nord

6086.4 --> 6089.839999999999
thrack thwacks

6091.6 --> 6096.8
dnd is primarily influenced by tolkien

6093.76 --> 6096.8
i'm not surprised

6100.0 --> 6103.119
although the elves

6101.84 --> 6105.1990000000005
in

6103.119 --> 6107.5199999999995
dungeons and dragons are very different

6105.199 --> 6109.199
from the elves in the lord of the rings

6107.52 --> 6110.96
because elves and the lord of the rings

6109.199 --> 6114.879999999999
are like

6110.96 --> 6114.88
very powerful humanoid creatures

6114.96 --> 6121.44
they're basically kind of like demi gods

6119.04 --> 6122.8
compared to the rest

6121.44 --> 6124.638999999999
it's very

6122.8 --> 6126.639
emphasized also and in dungeons and

6124.639 --> 6128.2390000000005
dragons elves are kind of like just

6126.639 --> 6132.1990000000005
different humans

6128.239 --> 6132.199
they are not demigods

6142.719 --> 6147.76
all right cosmology and talking is

6144.639 --> 6149.84
amazing almost a reflection of her yeah

6147.76 --> 6152.0
wouldn't go that far but

6149.84 --> 6154.639
as for the

6152.0 --> 6156.639
spiritual understanding

6154.639 --> 6160.08
that is

6156.639 --> 6162.56
basically written into the lore and the

6160.08 --> 6166.159
world and the story of lord of the rings

6162.56 --> 6169.52
especially yes it is profound

6166.159 --> 6171.5199999999995
it's very very amazing

6169.52 --> 6173.92
and like

6171.52 --> 6175.52
anybody can understand it

6173.92 --> 6177.52
once you

6175.52 --> 6180.4800000000005
yeah you reach

6177.52 --> 6182.159000000001
early adulthood like after 12 you're

6180.48 --> 6185.638999999999
gonna probably understand lord of the

6182.159 --> 6185.638999999999
rings really well

6203.119 --> 6207.28
no okay worship jesus thanks for that i

6205.36 --> 6209.44
didn't know

6207.28 --> 6209.44
it

6210.88 --> 6216.400000000001
right yeah elves no they're not immortal

6213.52 --> 6218.56
they just don't die from aging

6216.4 --> 6221.599999999999
there's other details though right elves

6218.56 --> 6226.159000000001
can die from loss of spirit

6221.6 --> 6226.159000000001
they literally can die from depression

6226.8 --> 6233.119000000001
right it doesn't actively happen

6230.96 --> 6234.159
in the in the story

6233.119 --> 6236.96
although

6234.159 --> 6238.799999999999
el runt does warn his daughter about

6236.96 --> 6241.199
that like

6238.8 --> 6243.679
he makes it depressing because it's like

6241.199 --> 6246.0
yeah if we're all leaving and your

6243.679 --> 6248.32
your love is dead what do you think is

6246.0 --> 6250.8
going to happen you're probably

6248.32 --> 6254.32
either going to wither away super alone

6250.8 --> 6254.320000000001
or yeah you might die

6255.84 --> 6261.1990000000005
because they can die they can die from

6258.96 --> 6263.6
physical harm

6261.199 --> 6265.44
and they can die from loss of spirit

6263.6 --> 6266.4800000000005
they can lose their spirit lose the will

6265.44 --> 6268.239
to live

6266.48 --> 6270.4
and then they do

6268.239 --> 6275.159
die

6270.4 --> 6275.159
so they're not perfectly immortal

6286.8 --> 6291.04
right and d

6288.719 --> 6293.199
sought more to

6291.04 --> 6298.0
kind of echo the

6293.199 --> 6301.04
woodland culture of the elves

6298.0 --> 6303.04
rather than like the the special boy

6301.04 --> 6305.5199999999995
breed and the immortalness of it

6303.04 --> 6308.719
although they do age long they they got

6305.52 --> 6308.719
a lot older elves

6309.04 --> 6314.239
than human race and dwarves and all that

6314.96 --> 6321.0
you're more of a gimli guy yeah now

6317.36 --> 6321.0
dwarves are awesome

6335.76 --> 6340.96
i yeah dwarves are awesome

6339.04 --> 6345.28
if you've yeah maybe you've heard of

6340.96 --> 6348.08
like the ascii game dwarf fortress

6345.28 --> 6351.44
it's all about dwarves

6348.08 --> 6353.6
and dig making your own moria

6351.44 --> 6355.919999999999
using dwarfs

6353.6 --> 6358.56
to basically dig your own minds that

6355.92 --> 6359.52
literally can lead into hell and and all

6358.56 --> 6362.4800000000005
that

6359.52 --> 6362.4800000000005
it's amazing

6367.92 --> 6372.88
most of tolkien's elven societies

6369.92 --> 6376.159
weren't woodland dwellers yes i know

6372.88 --> 6376.159000000001
but that's how it's different

6378.96 --> 6386.96
by the way in d d it's not all woodland

6383.679 --> 6389.36
you have the high elves too and

6386.96 --> 6391.76
but it's still kind of

6389.36 --> 6394.32
in that direction it's yeah maybe it

6391.76 --> 6397.679
should retract that it's not

6394.32 --> 6397.679
exclusively woodland

6398.84 --> 6403.76
elves right

6400.96 --> 6405.199
i guess it is kind of just more nerfed

6403.76 --> 6407.92
to make the

6405.199 --> 6409.599999999999
the characters like make them equal to

6407.92 --> 6411.36
humans and dwarves but like with a

6409.6 --> 6414.6
certain talent they have more agility

6411.36 --> 6414.599999999999
less constitution

6415.84 --> 6420.4800000000005
they don't need to sleep they meditate

6417.92 --> 6424.84
etc so yeah

6420.48 --> 6424.839999999999
nerfed like you said right

6432.08 --> 6437.76
it's a flat earth where the land of the

6435.28 --> 6441.119
gods is unknown by the middle earth yeah

6437.76 --> 6444.2390000000005
well you know we have the undying lands

6441.119 --> 6446.159
and it's highly suggested in ways if i

6444.239 --> 6448.5599999999995
always thought so

6446.159 --> 6451.36
that the undying lands

6448.56 --> 6451.360000000001
kind of were like

6453.76 --> 6459.280000000001
either like the continent of america

6457.679 --> 6461.36
or

6459.28 --> 6463.599999999999
like the north pole

6461.36 --> 6463.599999999999
right

6465.6 --> 6469.6
like the

6467.36 --> 6472.48
the secret island there

6469.6 --> 6473.52
with the four rivers

6472.48 --> 6476.678999999999
something

6473.52 --> 6476.679
like that

6484.88 --> 6489.92
yeah silmarillion

6487.76 --> 6492.320000000001
dude i still haven't read the silver

6489.92 --> 6494.56
alien to this day because i think it's

6492.32 --> 6494.5599999999995
like

6494.719 --> 6500.4
it weirds me out

6496.719 --> 6504.159
like that book is too surreal

6500.4 --> 6506.638999999999
i lose track of what's happening

6504.159 --> 6509.04
i've never been able to really read

6506.639 --> 6511.76
through it all it's just i find

6509.04 --> 6514.4
silmarillion very confusing but i

6511.76 --> 6516.56
definitely should read it

6514.4 --> 6518.638999999999
at some point and i've heard other

6516.56 --> 6520.400000000001
people talk about it it's just every

6518.639 --> 6525.08
time i try to

6520.4 --> 6525.08
tap into that it's just like ah

6526.159 --> 6529.119
get a bit of a headache

6538.88 --> 6544.0
but yes in the same aurelian you do get

6541.04 --> 6546.32
the origins of gandalf and of the elves

6544.0 --> 6548.56
and like the big struggle between

6546.32 --> 6551.44
the god of light and

6548.56 --> 6553.52
the god of darkness

6551.44 --> 6556.799999999999
who then created

6553.52 --> 6560.080000000001
sauron and all that and yeah

6556.8 --> 6562.400000000001
i do know the rough layout for what's

6560.08 --> 6565.639
going on in there but i haven't really

6562.4 --> 6565.638999999999
read it

6575.599 --> 6580.2390000000005
dwarfs an example of a great heart

6578.48 --> 6581.28
loyalty and faithful

6580.239 --> 6584.638999999999
yeah

6581.28 --> 6586.96
but dwarves can also be very corrupted

6584.639 --> 6591.159000000001
by the earthly don't forget about that

6586.96 --> 6591.159
part it's very significant

6611.119 --> 6615.839999999999
right because that was always like

6613.199 --> 6620.239
emphasized like elves are like

6615.84 --> 6622.56
spiritually uncorruptable sort of

6620.239 --> 6624.48
like that's unheard of

6622.56 --> 6626.320000000001
because they would die or something like

6624.48 --> 6630.08
the light of

6626.32 --> 6630.08
ellen deal would simply just

6630.48 --> 6635.119
they they can't

6632.08 --> 6635.92
it's physically impossible dwarfs

6635.119 --> 6640.08
are

6635.92 --> 6642.56
in a culture where it's very promoted

6640.08 --> 6645.599
to yeah to be loyal and faithful and all

6642.56 --> 6647.360000000001
that but they can like become

6645.599 --> 6651.0
obsessed with things

6647.36 --> 6651.0
especially wealth

6652.8 --> 6657.04
although it seems in the tolkien

6655.119 --> 6658.799999999999
universe it's humans that are like the

6657.04 --> 6661.04
worst at it all

6658.8 --> 6663.119000000001
they're always the most corrupted

6661.04 --> 6666.88
the most corruptible with everything and

6663.119 --> 6670.0
that's also of course why the the nazgul

6666.88 --> 6670.0
were originally human

6677.04 --> 6682.0
anyway wow time is flown well at least i

6679.92 --> 6684.96
feel a lot better now

6682.0 --> 6684.96
very glad of it

6685.52 --> 6688.159000000001
right so

6688.48 --> 6691.839999999999
i've been talking about a lot of

6689.679 --> 6693.599
different things today

6691.84 --> 6695.84
