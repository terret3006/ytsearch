2.9 --> 8.79
good morning

4.549 --> 12.389
this is Flat Earth early-bird this is my

8.79 --> 13.879
first hangout doing this welcome to the

12.389 --> 18.0
show

13.879 --> 19.619999999999997
yeah this is an open platform where you

18.0 --> 23.31
can talk about anything

19.62 --> 25.770000000000003
whatever yeah whatever it's been resting

23.31 --> 28.74
on you while you were sleeping and you

25.77 --> 32.55
wake up this so this is kind of like a

28.74 --> 35.51
breakfast show and yeah after the show

32.55 --> 38.57899999999999
which will last specifically an hour

35.51 --> 43.98
yeah I'm going to the Flat Earth debates

38.579 --> 45.719
as usual at Nathan Oakley's so yeah for

43.98 --> 49.57899999999999
starters today I have with me

45.719 --> 51.289
Travis hello Travis good morning Howard

49.579 --> 54.149
good morning

51.289 --> 56.19
that's afternoon for me already but yeah

54.149 --> 56.909
it's good this morning yeah how's the

56.19 --> 60.809
weather there

56.909 --> 64.8
it's soupy I got up this morning in time

60.809 --> 67.77
to shoot Venus if I could and it was not

64.8 --> 70.8
visible so yeah it's it's absolutely

67.77 --> 74.22
atrocious I just you know when you think

70.8 --> 76.05
about the way that we I mean I'm looking

74.22 --> 79.74
outside and I can see man-made clouds

76.05 --> 84.57
and I can say I can see natural clouds

79.74 --> 86.66999999999999
and there's a vast difference indeed you

84.57 --> 88.35
know if you think about it right in a

86.67 --> 89.55
certain amount of time pretty soon those

88.35 --> 91.86
man-made clouds are gonna be in the

89.55 --> 94.25999999999999
textbook says that they're natural

91.86 --> 97.14
going back to grade school with cumulus

94.26 --> 98.85000000000001
and Nimbus and Cirrus and although you

97.14 --> 100.53
know how many different I don't even

98.85 --> 104.46
think there was maybe for you know

100.53 --> 106.95
certain times in clouds right I think

104.46 --> 109.71
anything more than the wealth Cirrus the

106.95 --> 111.87
cirrus clouds and rabbit or anything is

109.71 --> 116.85
is that the chemtrails basically emulate

111.87 --> 119.46000000000001
that concept because series is just dust

116.85 --> 122.46
being blown up from Sahara usually and

119.46 --> 125.33999999999999
that then causes that's how I learned I

122.46 --> 127.97999999999999
learned about it in school but yet they

125.34 --> 130.17000000000002
try to emulate that constantly with

127.98 --> 132.719
these chemtrails it basically comes down

130.17 --> 134.42999999999998
to the same type of feathers except

132.719 --> 135.81
these are artificial

134.43 --> 138.959
and so they're constantly doing

135.81 --> 141.5
engineering all over the place I'm very

138.959 --> 144.36
happy to report that today here

141.5 --> 147.81
contrasting yesterday is a completely

144.36 --> 152.25
clear blue sky now I haven't seen a

147.81 --> 154.079
single show or whatever but yeah I

152.25 --> 158.45
expected probably you're gonna change

154.079 --> 161.97
yeah later on yeah well I was happy for

158.45 --> 163.67999999999998
very nice Monday or Tuesday

161.97 --> 165.18
whenever I was able to get out and it

163.68 --> 167.91
was a clear morning for the sunrise I

165.18 --> 170.31
got that live shot for the sunrise and

167.91 --> 174.959
then I'm still trying to edit this stuff

170.31 --> 178.89000000000001
from getting Venus and the sunrise on my

174.959 --> 181.26
p900 so try to get that up soon yeah

178.89 --> 184.07899999999998
yeah I wish I could do something like

181.26 --> 186.599
that as well that's so funny when you

184.079 --> 188.84900000000002
when you think about what Randy does and

186.599 --> 191.57899999999998
if you see him open up his windows with

188.849 --> 193.79899999999998
all of his foot photos I mean I I

191.579 --> 197.519
totally I'm not even near the scale of

193.799 --> 199.049
where he is but I have so much data that

197.519 --> 203.13
there's no way I'm gonna be able to

199.049 --> 204.93
process at all how do you mean so much

203.13 --> 207.329
in terms of in terms of what I've shot

204.93 --> 209.579
he was taking so many photographs of me

207.329 --> 212.97
right right he's just got only files and

209.579 --> 216.269
so many pictures it's just insanely an

212.97 --> 219.29
ordinate it's just crazy it's funny it

216.269 --> 223.37900000000002
kind of reminds me about my my brother I

219.29 --> 226.59
talk about him that much but he used to

223.379 --> 229.01899999999998
be a fanatical supporter he might still

226.59 --> 231.12
be in but he constantly changes around

229.019 --> 235.169
because he gets like problems with his

231.12 --> 237.93
shoulder and whatever and he would

235.169 --> 242.84900000000002
always make photographs of these so like

237.93 --> 248.549
even ten years ago he had like a library

242.849 --> 251.94
of like 15 or 25 thousand pictures just

248.549 --> 253.799
oh my god dude it's like not to get like

251.94 --> 255.87
stereotypical or something but like are

253.799 --> 257.729
you like a Japanese different like every

255.87 --> 261.93
freaking vacation everything dude's like

257.729 --> 264.0
oceans fuzzy crashing ah and I wouldn't

261.93 --> 266.01
like you would want to show them to me

264.0 --> 267.69
but yeah it's like okay if I'm gonna

266.01 --> 269.62
just sit there it's gonna take half an

267.69 --> 272.06
hour

269.62 --> 278.36
just looking at all these freaking

272.06 --> 280.13
photographs yeah crazy i'ma just go

278.36 --> 282.98
somewhere and I take a max of 30

280.13 --> 286.82
pictures at least how I you see do it

282.98 --> 289.43
yeah hmm I just had a friend of mine

286.82 --> 292.13
from high school post on Facebook that

289.43 --> 295.33
there was a shooting in the county where

292.13 --> 300.14
I grew up a mass shooting at a

295.33 --> 303.40999999999997
California dance bar 12 people killed no

300.14 --> 305.57
I heard about that yeah suspected gunman

303.41 --> 318.20000000000005
is dead at least a dozen people are

305.57 --> 324.28999999999996
injured yeah keeps on going huh yeah I

318.2 --> 326.47999999999996
yeah hey I don't know how to even like

324.29 --> 328.88
respond to that right I don't know I

326.48 --> 330.98
haven't really looked into it's like I

328.88 --> 334.48
am sorry to get really sick of this

330.98 --> 337.99
whether they be real or fake it's just

334.48 --> 340.67
like it's trying to absorb all our time

337.99 --> 345.08
it feels like it's being more of a

340.67 --> 349.22
distraction than then something I could

345.08 --> 351.40999999999997
learn from by now yeah well I suppose

349.22 --> 354.89000000000004
that that's I mean you know you've got a

351.41 --> 356.96000000000004
certain amount of level of current

354.89 --> 358.96999999999997
events that are educational and

356.96 --> 362.57
informative and then also trivial you

358.97 --> 366.65000000000003
know I mean you would think that on on

362.57 --> 369.8
the one hand what the next-door neighbor

366.65 --> 373.96
is doing with his cars in his front yard

369.8 --> 373.96000000000004
isn't as important as a mass shooting

374.17 --> 377.17
right

377.32 --> 382.14
indeed yeah it downgrades everything

383.22 --> 389.17
what I was saying before we went live

385.39 --> 391.0
was that I've changed back to my former

389.17 --> 392.47
employer where I'm gonna have some more

391.0 --> 393.88
time in the morning and I've been trying

392.47 --> 397.86
to think about how I can be more of an

393.88 --> 400.93
activist in terms of getting into the

397.86 --> 404.35
public schools at least getting in to

400.93 --> 407.53000000000003
talk to administration or perhaps

404.35 --> 410.37
setting up interviews with teachers in

407.53 --> 413.59
their field and just having a

410.37 --> 415.39
journalistic approach to bringing up the

413.59 --> 417.42999999999995
discussion of not only flat earth but

415.39 --> 422.46999999999997
even ultimate you know narratives

417.43 --> 426.69
alternate history because I had I had no

422.47 --> 430.06
insight into any of this a year ago and

426.69 --> 435.21999999999997
the stuff that I was hearing on YouTube

430.06 --> 438.46
with channels like crow or Mex Egan just

435.22 --> 443.26000000000005
absolutely blew my mind

438.46 --> 446.85999999999996
I just I would never have questioned the

443.26 --> 450.76
narrative I just do to imagine that

446.86 --> 452.59000000000003
there was an alternate story to World

450.76 --> 454.59999999999997
War one or the Civil War as a

452.59 --> 457.17999999999995
Revolutionary War all that stuff it's

454.6 --> 459.49
just it just oh and and and when I was

457.18 --> 463.69
May first when those concept first hit

459.49 --> 466.66
me which was years ago I was so shocking

463.69 --> 470.74
to me that I just like almost panicked

466.66 --> 473.17
from it like turned me real I wasn't too

470.74 --> 477.16
much of a conspiracy no word back then

473.17 --> 479.86
and it was such a shock that and they

477.16 --> 483.37
really were compelling in their

479.86 --> 486.07
arguments but yeah and for me I was

483.37 --> 487.96
intrigued you know I wasn't put off I

486.07 --> 494.56
wasn't I don't I didn't have a visceral

487.96 --> 496.51
reaction I wasn't like I the amount of

494.56 --> 500.62
it for me I have a friend who really

496.51 --> 505.81
does not like crow and I I really didn't

500.62 --> 508.02
like row 7 yeah but I really do like

505.81 --> 510.08
crow and Jason I think that they do

508.02 --> 513.74
fantastic research

510.08 --> 517.279
and when I was listening to a lot of

513.74 --> 519.32
their shows I was I was just blown away

517.279 --> 522.11
like I said and it was so compelling

519.32 --> 524.0
that I was intrigued to look into it

522.11 --> 526.399
further so I didn't have a visceral

524.0 --> 528.14
reaction of rejecting the information

526.399 --> 531.079
and saying it's not possible I was just

528.14 --> 535.8199999999999
thinking what the hell if this is true

531.079 --> 537.4699999999999
oh I was just like thrown back into into

535.82 --> 545.1800000000001
my education I'm like I have to learn

537.47 --> 548.8100000000001
about this right well I wanted to know

545.18 --> 551.7199999999999
but I was basically back then afraid to

548.81 --> 554.029
even start talking about it because but

551.72 --> 556.94
I was very vulnerable to peer pressure

554.029 --> 560.0889999999999
back then all kinds it was basically

556.94 --> 563.3000000000001
like a liberal but extremely flexible I

560.089 --> 567.23
kind of the weird thing was and I still

563.3 --> 569.75
am I am just naturally tolerant and then

567.23 --> 571.5500000000001
if you're yeah like oh yeah I'm going to

569.75 --> 573.079
help the good crowd you know the

571.55 --> 575.7199999999999
Liberals that's how it started with me

573.079 --> 578.12
because the on the surface their

575.72 --> 582.77
principle sound is very good and

578.12 --> 587.149
interesting and inspiring to me but yet

582.77 --> 590.72
that didn't turn how to be quite they

587.149 --> 594.26
turn out to be total hypocrites and 180

590.72 --> 599.12
degree liars basically with absolutely

594.26 --> 600.95
everything and now I lost track what I

599.12 --> 604.0600000000001
was talking about well who are we

600.95 --> 606.38
talking about I was just talking about

604.06 --> 608.42
coming across the information of

606.38 --> 612.23
alternative narratives in his right

608.42 --> 616.579
ranked Perot triple southern yes yes and

612.23 --> 620.82
I I do like her he's a good storyteller

616.579 --> 625.6899999999999
but I personally think he's sometimes

620.82 --> 628.7800000000001
too much what do you think he just likes

625.69 --> 630.7600000000001
to push it a lily like to go really

628.78 --> 634.12
naked really yeah it feels like he does

630.76 --> 635.47
that and I think he's over obsessed with

634.12 --> 637.54
gematria but yeah

635.47 --> 638.89
everybody has their tics yeah you know

637.54 --> 642.6999999999999
he does and other than that he's

638.89 --> 645.52
fantastic he's very sharp only like a

642.7 --> 647.8000000000001
lot of sharp people I think he tends to

645.52 --> 650.65
go to many conclusions from his

647.8 --> 654.7299999999999
observations it's a very common pitfall

650.65 --> 659.11
is for me as well being very careful

654.73 --> 660.7
yeah what I well I I was a little bit

659.11 --> 662.0500000000001
proud of myself to a certain extent

660.7 --> 663.49
because when I was first looking into

662.05 --> 666.1899999999999
this and thinking through all of this

663.49 --> 669.78
conspiracy stuff I I coined a phrase for

666.19 --> 672.61
my thought process where I said

669.78 --> 675.49
reasonable doubt is the mother of

672.61 --> 678.99
conspiracy all right so if you come

675.49 --> 681.72
across a narrative of some sort and

678.99 --> 683.89
there's no reason to doubt it

681.72 --> 686.26
there's not going to be a conspiracy

683.89 --> 688.36
about it technically I mean a being on

686.26 --> 689.77
the perfect world but if there is

688.36 --> 692.0500000000001
something about the narrative where it

689.77 --> 694.84
makes you stop and look and squint your

692.05 --> 697.5999999999999
eyes and [ __ ] your head that's

694.84 --> 700.51
reasonable doubt so then you start to

697.6 --> 701.02
offer well ok wait this doesn't make

700.51 --> 703.63
sense

701.02 --> 705.04
yeah and that's what crow says he says

703.63 --> 707.2
that this way though he says he had he

705.04 --> 710.5
says you have to look to see if there is

707.2 --> 713.5300000000001
a there there is there something there

710.5 --> 716.89
for you to investigate and I think

713.53 --> 720.76
that's pretty insightful but you have to

716.89 --> 722.74
remember that like these really clever

720.76 --> 726.28
people that fabricate these narratives

722.74 --> 730.72
also know this right and they into it

726.28 --> 734.29
they create conspiracies for us that are

730.72 --> 736.48
relatively in plain sight that a lot of

734.29 --> 739.48
people will immediately jump over and

736.48 --> 742.96
polarize onto so that the more subtle

739.48 --> 744.82
details that they need to share but they

742.96 --> 747.52
don't want everyone to really recognize

744.82 --> 751.5100000000001
it except the people that they want it

747.52 --> 752.6899999999999
to recognize because they like through

751.51 --> 754.79
code

752.69 --> 758.75
that message gets across without being

754.79 --> 763.31
noticed it's fairly easy just inject

758.75 --> 766.34
reptilians or UFOs or anything some kind

763.31 --> 769.13
of extra story element to it that'll

766.34 --> 774.2
distract from the more subtle details of

769.13 --> 778.48
the real story mm-hmm it's a very

774.2 --> 778.48
devious tactic but it works really well

778.63 --> 785.21
and I focus a lot on this now it's like

783.2 --> 787.07
basically filtering out the different

785.21 --> 788.7800000000001
strings the different narratives how

787.07 --> 791.6
they've been woven through each other

788.78 --> 794.42
and then tried to distinguish like what

791.6 --> 796.5500000000001
narrative line is this which thread is

794.42 --> 798.38
this which thread is this how he how is

796.55 --> 801.29
he trying to weave it where is he going

798.38 --> 803.6
his knitting process I do this a lot

801.29 --> 807.0799999999999
Alex Jones I do this a lot with a lot of

803.6 --> 809.99
people because I see that all these

807.08 --> 816.1600000000001
narratives as threads that are being

809.99 --> 816.16
woven and continued and expanded upon oh

817.9 --> 824.4399999999999
yeah David read in chat bow and arrow

821.39 --> 824.4399999999999
yes indeed it is

825.16 --> 831.31
it's a more classic composite longbow

831.52 --> 835.3
made in Bulgaria

838.51 --> 846.4
I headed in storage for a while and I

843.73 --> 850.51
thought I wanted to kind of use it as a

846.4 --> 860.35
problem so as if you proved my elven

850.51 --> 864.01
nature but yeah that's that all right so

860.35 --> 866.26
a everybody in chat if you would like to

864.01 --> 868.09
join they're still at least 40 minutes

866.26 --> 871.35
of show

868.09 --> 874.69
I'm here with Travis um

871.35 --> 877.5400000000001
early bird Flat Earth early bird first

874.69 --> 880.3900000000001
bill and yeah always ready to have some

877.54 --> 883.42
more people on just contact me on skype

880.39 --> 886.18
you have to go there and I will give you

883.42 --> 890.01
the Hangout link if I think I can trust

886.18 --> 890.01
you that's how this works

890.64 --> 894.55
yeah I've always thought that I would be

892.72 --> 898.72
an interesting Avenue if Nathan took

894.55 --> 900.76
that to simply hand out the not make it

898.72 --> 903.01
public you know because we've got enough

900.76 --> 904.84
people on the the panel that can take up

903.01 --> 907.99
those spots but then if you had someone

904.84 --> 910.57
who wanted to come on then that would

907.99 --> 912.22
make it a little bit more of a filtering

910.57 --> 914.62
process so where you wouldn't just have

912.22 --> 918.39
anybody willy-nilly showing up but the

914.62 --> 923.89
Nathan would be be handing out the key

918.39 --> 927.64
you know personally right it's not it's

923.89 --> 930.61
not for his show like he gets people to

927.64 --> 933.0699999999999
basically man up and just step in there

930.61 --> 934.99
oh no but what I mean is yeah yeah I

933.07 --> 937.0300000000001
suppose I but that's what I mean like if

934.99 --> 939.4
someone wanted to come on then what

937.03 --> 941.53
you're saying they would contact him on

939.4 --> 942.97
skype and then he would see that they're

941.53 --> 945.61
interested so that it would be more of a

942.97 --> 946.1800000000001
filtering process either if he didn't do

945.61 --> 948.19
it himself

946.18 --> 950.05
if he had someone in the back chat like

948.19 --> 951.61
you or someone else responsible for

950.05 --> 955.18
we're giving out the key I think that

951.61 --> 957.25
that would be alright yeah I'm not gonna

955.18 --> 960.8199999999999
get like real glowers on the show ever

957.25 --> 963.4
because they can be trusted with a few

960.82 --> 967.2700000000001
exceptions like people like Apollo ands

963.4 --> 970.649
in there I would trust them if they

967.27 --> 973.319
correct me on the show but like there

970.649 --> 976.199
killers like P Mars no thank you sorry

973.319 --> 978.0889999999999
pedia I think you're amusing guy but I'm

976.199 --> 987.149
not gonna allow you on the show because

978.089 --> 988.4590000000001
you're unpredictable and yeah well you

987.149 --> 991.459
may be I will

988.459 --> 994.17
or rather I will on a one-on-one show

991.459 --> 997.3789999999999
just to see what happens but I'm not

994.17 --> 999.929
gonna let him like disrupt good digging

997.379 --> 1003.3190000000001
the early bird the situation here and

999.929 --> 1005.24

1292.359 --> 1296.4089999999999
swing I guess let me but we have had a

1294.669 --> 1300.3690000000001
lot of hot days which is more like some

1296.409 --> 1303.279
of any screen hmm we had a really hot

1300.369 --> 1305.9399999999998
spring here in Netherlands it hadn't in

1303.279 --> 1308.71
May it was like insane was full summer

1305.94 --> 1322.8690000000001
it's the hottest spring I've seen in in

1308.71 --> 1324.909
a decade it's amazing yeah yeah I just

1322.869 --> 1328.559
do it not so long ago I know dave has

1324.909 --> 1328.5590000000002
been watching since you started that

1332.309 --> 1339.399
what you guys talking about

1334.84 --> 1341.62
oh just general stuff didn't talking

1339.399 --> 1347.62
about the weather and chemtrails and

1341.62 --> 1350.32
geoengineering what else backgrounds I

1347.62 --> 1353.7399999999998
think one of the things I brought up was

1350.32 --> 1355.12
just with the added time I'm having in

1353.74 --> 1358.539
the morning I'm gonna try to get a

1355.12 --> 1363.9989999999998
little bit more active with the with the

1358.539 --> 1365.769
community and the education system the

1363.999 --> 1371.98
yeah you got some more time

1365.769 --> 1374.6490000000001
a off-road that's gonna be so noisy no

1371.98 --> 1377.019
no more no more trouble yeah yeah well

1374.649 --> 1379.6
yeah nothing less you guys are on in the

1377.019 --> 1381.039
afternoon or if I'm if I happen to get

1379.6 --> 1382.299
sometimes they have because we're

1381.039 --> 1383.4089999999999
getting into the peak season right now

1382.299 --> 1386.44
because it's getting close to the

1383.409 --> 1391.3890000000001
holiday so the company that I'm working

1386.44 --> 1397.1490000000001
for right now it transports parcels and

1391.389 --> 1400.2099999999998
posts so like a couple days ago I got

1397.149 --> 1404.7589999999998
called in early because a company was

1400.21 --> 1409.83
gonna have a trailer full of um Macy's

1404.759 --> 1415.98
and so if I do get called in early then

1409.83 --> 1415.98
it might have a horn blast for you

1419.389 --> 1429.109
ah sorry the district is all over the

1424.309 --> 1433.399
place oh uh right so what's been going

1429.109 --> 1436.369
on recently matter debates just get a

1433.399 --> 1439.779
little bit into that I think there's

1436.369 --> 1443.9289999999999
this new city

1439.779 --> 1446.509
this new doublethink a lot about the

1443.929 --> 1449.479
straightness of floors and everything

1446.509 --> 1452.779
and now all obstruction is always

1449.479 --> 1454.009
curvature I think that's the new the new

1452.779 --> 1457.579
mind trick

1454.009 --> 1459.529
they've been forcing on themselves and

1457.579 --> 1462.229
it's really hilarious and I wonder how

1459.529 --> 1466.07
long they can keep it up to dusk that is

1462.229 --> 1468.3790000000001
just insanity in plain sight more than

1466.07 --> 1471.229
anything else it's not like a sideway

1468.379 --> 1474.079
excuse is just an out outright blatant

1471.229 --> 1475.82
declaration like there is no obstruction

1474.079 --> 1478.369
that effect that optical track doesn't

1475.82 --> 1481.029
exist it is always curvature it's

1478.369 --> 1484.609
literally what they're trying to do it's

1481.029 --> 1492.859
incredible that they have the balls left

1484.609 --> 1494.4789999999998
to even do that yeah because if we're

1492.859 --> 1497.57
gonna test it if we like have an

1494.479 --> 1500.089
official contest about it like with

1497.57 --> 1504.139
demonstrations I think they're gonna

1500.089 --> 1506.57
come out asleep I don't think so we will

1504.139 --> 1509.149
be able to make very accurate detailed

1506.57 --> 1511.82
predictions they'll match up perfectly

1509.149 --> 1516.279
and they will have a lot of sidetrack

1511.82 --> 1520.9589999999998
stories and and the the sideview

1516.279 --> 1520.959
diagrams and everything and that's it

1526.239 --> 1530.299
they're tough yeah I'm your background

1528.259 --> 1533.479
yeah I'm sitting in I'm sitting in

1530.299 --> 1536.45
Panera so they're talking to the

1533.479 --> 1547.909
customers that's right so go on your

1536.45 --> 1548.419
show you're a second so music you all

1547.909 --> 1550.3990000000001
right yeah

1548.419 --> 1553.959
William music freak MC you got anything

1550.399 --> 1553.9589999999998
to add any story to tell

1555.49 --> 1562.73
here's beyond well uh pretty much

1559.91 --> 1565.94
throughout most of my school career have

1562.73 --> 1570.98
been challenging the whole thing about

1565.94 --> 1574.39
this models so pretty much neutral in

1570.98 --> 1576.53
most aspects in terms of the fact that I

1574.39 --> 1578.8400000000001
believe that we don't know what shape

1576.53 --> 1580.6399999999999
the earth is it can be flat it can be

1578.84 --> 1582.8
round nobody knows and will probably

1580.64 --> 1584.96
never know in this lifetime all we can

1582.8 --> 1591.62
do is speculate and come to our own

1584.96 --> 1595.43
conclusions right but don't you think

1591.62 --> 1597.26
that's not entirely correct we might not

1595.43 --> 1599.39
be able to figure out the entire shape

1597.26 --> 1605.54
but we can absolutely figure out that

1599.39 --> 1607.25
it's not a ball yes that is that is true

1605.54 --> 1609.8
I mean I've been challenging us since

1607.25 --> 1610.94
hours in school because I've always

1609.8 --> 1612.47
believed there was something more to

1610.94 --> 1614.06
what people are telling us it's like

1612.47 --> 1615.89
everything in life people tell us what

1614.06 --> 1625.1799999999998
they think we need to know not what we

1615.89 --> 1627.5900000000001
should know yes buts greatest thing of

1625.18 --> 1631.19
one of the biggest things about the

1627.59 --> 1633.26
human character is yes we all desire the

1631.19 --> 1636.89
truth but at the end of the day the

1633.26 --> 1638.75
whole world revolves on a lie so the

1636.89 --> 1642.8000000000002
only way to find the truth is to get

1638.75 --> 1646.76
beyond the laws and to start searching

1642.8 --> 1648.83
and yes and stepping on toes because

1646.76 --> 1651.89
that is usually what prevents people

1648.83 --> 1654.32
from doing that the fear is that it's

1651.89 --> 1656.51
stepping on toes that's why they go with

1654.32 --> 1658.9099999999999
the system with the narrative whatever

1656.51 --> 1661.04
it may be because then they know they'll

1658.91 --> 1664.25
not a get into trouble for talking about

1661.04 --> 1665.84
it well at the end of the day no matter

1664.25 --> 1668.33
what you do in life you're going to step

1665.84 --> 1670.61
on somebody's toes so look this whole

1668.33 --> 1672.11
this whole fear of where people have of

1670.61 --> 1673.52
stepping on people's toe is just a man

1672.11 --> 1676.52
thing they've taught from a young age

1673.52 --> 1678.02
that you're a certain thing is you can

1676.52 --> 1680.75
discuss Gus there are certain things

1678.02 --> 1682.1
that are set in law and the descriptive

1680.75 --> 1683.54
thing is that people are blind enough to

1682.1 --> 1685.1299999999999
believe it to believe the laws they are

1683.54 --> 1686.72
told in everyday love at the end of the

1685.13 --> 1688.2800000000002
day people need

1686.72 --> 1689.63
to be presented with both sides of the

1688.28 --> 1695.3899999999999
story and may come to their own

1689.63 --> 1698.0300000000002
conclusions indeed but yeah then they

1695.39 --> 1700.49
need to have learned critical thought

1698.03 --> 1704.539
usually a process you best learn by your

1700.49 --> 1706.85
parents because they have already they

1704.539 --> 1709.97
pretty much have the the pre tools that

1706.85 --> 1713.1789999999999
you have so they will always be the best

1709.97 --> 1715.64
example in how to progress in the future

1713.179 --> 1717.3500000000001
more critical thought because they are a

1715.64 --> 1719.21
little to your level usually until

1717.35 --> 1721.4499999999998
you're like an unless you're like a

1719.21 --> 1724.28
unique Mathilde like exception

1721.45 --> 1725.96
they usually have grandmother's or

1724.28 --> 1728.84
grandfathers that are extremely

1725.96 --> 1731.48
brilliant as well so if they're still

1728.84 --> 1733.73
wrong but they're yeah you need to learn

1731.48 --> 1736.3600000000001
that at a very young age you need to be

1733.73 --> 1741.38
recognized for your intelligence first

1736.36 --> 1744.11
otherwise it's gonna turn bad it's gonna

1741.38 --> 1749.6000000000001
find its own route to express itself and

1744.11 --> 1753.07
usually in a sneaky way or whatever you

1749.6 --> 1757.03
need an example how to use it properly

1753.07 --> 1760.37
yes that is true that's why I've been

1757.03 --> 1762.559
busy with my second channel I currently

1760.37 --> 1764.4499999999998
run two channels what which which was

1762.559 --> 1767.03
dedicated to independent music artists

1764.45 --> 1770.539
and I'm busy opening up a channel

1767.03 --> 1771.98
revolving around like also similar to

1770.539 --> 1774.02
discussions like what you are doing

1771.98 --> 1778.13
in fact at a different time slot

1774.02 --> 1780.049
according to our period of calm but more

1778.13 --> 1783.1100000000001
on general topics like you because I

1780.049 --> 1787.52
like to expand beyond what people are

1783.11 --> 1789.7099999999998
just talking about one subject there are

1787.52 --> 1794.09
many possibilities to explore at the end

1789.71 --> 1796.49
of the day indeed well this show is it

1794.09 --> 1799.9089999999999
is kind of like mint for flavor there's

1796.49 --> 1802.52
I guess is involved in the debates but

1799.909 --> 1805.5200000000002
it is a pretty Jen this is like talk

1802.52 --> 1809.36
about anything you know just don't talk

1805.52 --> 1813.289
about very tedious personal stories or

1809.36 --> 1815.53
whatever but no yeah just just talk

1813.289 --> 1819.32
about whatever talk about your history

1815.53 --> 1820.1399999999999
talk about ideas you have or dreams you

1819.32 --> 1822.1789999999999
had

1820.14 --> 1824.76
we finally can talk about spiritual

1822.179 --> 1828.0300000000002
stuff all over the place you know why do

1824.76 --> 1831.87
you want your card your star shining red

1828.03 --> 1832.77
or whatever I'll do it I can eat the

1831.87 --> 1834.78
rest your baby

1832.77 --> 1837.78
I can pretty much debate on the Bible

1834.78 --> 1840.48
all day because I am looked into so many

1837.78 --> 1842.22
different religions and I can tell you

1840.48 --> 1844.02
about in so many different religions the

1842.22 --> 1851.8500000000001
biggest flaw in all religion is that it

1844.02 --> 1854.429
was written by man I disagree man can be

1851.85 --> 1856.6499999999999
a conduit for the divine absolutely the

1854.429 --> 1862.5900000000001
problem is is that most religions have

1856.65 --> 1866.7900000000002
been designed as a call corporation so

1862.59 --> 1869.1599999999999
the system that has to self enforce

1866.79 --> 1872.37
basically yourself progress and there

1869.16 --> 1877.0700000000002
lies the flaw because that it makes it

1872.37 --> 1880.32
prone to politicization to choose

1877.07 --> 1882.4189999999999
instead of God's rules just the

1880.32 --> 1884.8799999999999
convenience for example to the church

1882.419 --> 1888.1200000000001
and they do this all the time this is a

1884.88 --> 1892.0800000000002
unified problem for all organized

1888.12 --> 1894.4499999999998
religions is that they do stir will have

1892.08 --> 1896.52
traits of a corporation and with the

1894.45 --> 1899.8500000000001
effects that come with that for the

1896.52 --> 1903.179
people in it and either it could go bust

1899.85 --> 1905.6689999999999
or it could go dark and these things

1903.179 --> 1908.01
tend to happen as time progresses

1905.669 --> 1910.38
especially with a very involving world

1908.01 --> 1914.059
that's constantly trying to talk from

1910.38 --> 1916.5900000000001
all directions with tax stuff and just

1914.059 --> 1921.48
popular media harassment in the other

1916.59 --> 1926.25
ships so it's dangerous any type of

1921.48 --> 1928.89
church is I'll not be fanatical about it

1926.25 --> 1931.89
but yeah I think that jesus warned about

1928.89 --> 1933.8700000000001
it like church is basically there is

1931.89 --> 1936.51
only one church and that is the church

1933.87 --> 1940.53
it's of your spirit of your personal

1936.51 --> 1943.919
dedication to the principles and to the

1940.53 --> 1946.799
path and if you're gonna form a church

1943.919 --> 1949.38
yeah that's nice in the sense that you

1946.799 --> 1953.94
can find a common ground the community

1949.38 --> 1959.99
in it but to then mark that community as

1953.94 --> 1963.69
being the authority that is wrong

1959.99 --> 1964.8
there's a logical problem where a lot of

1963.69 --> 1966.3300000000002
the problem you have with the church

1964.8 --> 1968.34
system today is especially if they

1966.33 --> 1971.52
because most of the churches are now

1968.34 --> 1974.61
registered as a business and no longer

1971.52 --> 1976.29
as a non-profit entity Church the church

1974.61 --> 1979.59
has moved away from the prospect of

1976.29 --> 1981.03
being a vessel of being a bubble to

1979.59 --> 1984.1699999999998
being a business for the preacher to

1981.03 --> 1988.86
make money at the end of the day well

1984.17 --> 1991.47
yep it's potentially but it's at least

1988.86 --> 1994.11
to self-sustain and it's the same

1991.47 --> 1995.79
problem with science organization they

1994.11 --> 1998.85
have to follow the corporate model

1995.79 --> 2000.5
because they're all dependent on the

1998.85 --> 2003.4699999999998
financial system and everything that

2000.5 --> 2005.51
comes with it so if you want to be

2003.47 --> 2008.27
Carmen or become an organization you

2005.51 --> 2010.28
will gain corporate trademarks and

2008.27 --> 2012.2
either you use that to stay just

2010.28 --> 2014.93
perfectly stable like a voluntary

2012.2 --> 2016.19
organization type setup or there are

2014.93 --> 2018.8600000000001
people in there that are like

2016.19 --> 2021.5900000000001
encouraging no we can build more or

2018.86 --> 2024.4099999999999
getting more money and then it's just up

2021.59 --> 2028.8799999999999
to what happens if they actually do it

2024.41 --> 2031.52
or they just sit on a pile of money yes

2028.88 --> 2034.3400000000001
and also under law which I've discovered

2031.52 --> 2035.78
recently you a mess it's not an amount

2034.34 --> 2037.73
of followers is something but do you

2035.78 --> 2039.3799999999999
believe under law you can declare your

2037.73 --> 2049.76
own religion which is absolute bollocks

2039.38 --> 2052.37
I don't mind no but no I have my own

2049.76 --> 2056.0600000000004
religion but it's it's constantly

2052.37 --> 2057.38
evolving and changing like depending on

2056.06 --> 2059.96
the knowledge that I gained Ian's

2057.38 --> 2065.6600000000003
becoming more and more and more ethereal

2059.96 --> 2069.38
and more or less about any written thing

2065.66 --> 2072.919
it's all about the essence and all about

2069.38 --> 2076.1600000000003
this make distinguishing I say that

2072.919 --> 2080.5099999999998
God's rules are written in creation

2076.16 --> 2084.919
itself and in our response to it yeah

2080.51 --> 2087.5
was also in terms of the church I mean I

2084.919 --> 2090.1389999999997
found religion in Excel

2087.5 --> 2092.54
is fine but a lot of the problem that we

2090.139 --> 2093.9190000000003
pick up with the religion of today

2092.54 --> 2097.46
especially in the churches there's a lot

2093.919 --> 2099.23
of cliques in the church there's more

2097.46 --> 2100.88
tension showing to people who talk money

2099.23 --> 2103.31
when to people in the poor in the church

2100.88 --> 2105.38
as well which is the essence of the

2103.31 --> 2109.67
church was to was to help the report in

2105.38 --> 2110.75
the Bible days so why do they now focus

2109.67 --> 2112.58
on the people who are bringing money

2110.75 --> 2116.26
into the church and not on the people

2112.58 --> 2121.15
they supposed to be helping as a church

2116.26 --> 2121.15
that I don't really know if that is true

2121.21 --> 2128.15
it's a number it depends as I said it

2124.82 --> 2131.3300000000004
depends on literally the church and the

2128.15 --> 2133.55
church specific churches so not the

2131.33 --> 2135.3199999999997
entire church organization but just

2133.55 --> 2143.1800000000003
specific church it all depends on how

2135.32 --> 2145.46
they do it this church here they really

2143.18 --> 2148.3999999999996
do take care of the poor they really

2145.46 --> 2150.89
really make an effort so yeah it all

2148.4 --> 2153.29
depends per Church there are some

2150.89 --> 2155.98
churches but also what you pick up a lot

2153.29 --> 2159.32
with the with the church community is

2155.98 --> 2161.6
they did early or very much trying to

2159.32 --> 2164.48
involve themselves too much in politics

2161.6 --> 2173.36
as opposed to focusing on other things

2164.48 --> 2176.9900000000002
in their community that are going on on

2173.36 --> 2178.9100000000003
the region because if politics involves

2176.99 --> 2180.68
themselves with the church then it's not

2178.91 --> 2182.33
strange that a church will involve

2180.68 --> 2190.25
themselves in politics one way or the

2182.33 --> 2195.35
other so they have to otherwise move

2190.25 --> 2197.57
around and everything yes if politicians

2195.35 --> 2199.46
start to say yeah all churches are evil

2197.57 --> 2203.1800000000003
and we don't care about them anymore

2199.46 --> 2205.58
just poop on their doorsteps or whatever

2203.18 --> 2209.24
yeah you're gonna have to actually speak

2205.58 --> 2211.79
out about that and remind the people why

2209.24 --> 2215.18
these specific individuals say that and

2211.79 --> 2218.27
what their background is and so yeah if

2215.18 --> 2220.97
the Poli if politics involves itself

2218.27 --> 2222.59
with with your church then

2220.97 --> 2226.04
yeah you're gonna have to get involved

2222.59 --> 2228.2000000000003
in politics even just in a defensive

2226.04 --> 2230.8
position is work but yeah I'm not

2228.2 --> 2233.359
talking about like the really corrupting

2230.8 --> 2238.94
churches that just take federal money

2233.359 --> 2242.33
and then tag the the propaganda words as

2238.94 --> 2244.4900000000002
you just give the light just like the

2242.33 --> 2246.83
regular news give the standard rhetoric

2244.49 --> 2251.99
that is required for them to receive the

2246.83 --> 2257.9
tax cuts and anything that's very United

2251.99 --> 2260.18
States must be the significant churches

2257.9 --> 2262.07
have the only excuse me I've been around

2260.18 --> 2263.83
and not for them in my life I used to be

2262.07 --> 2276.26
a worship leader myself in the church

2263.83 --> 2277.8199999999997
really yes I play four instruments so so

2276.26 --> 2281.5400000000004
I've seen a lot of how the inner

2277.82 --> 2283.7000000000003
workings of these what they call based

2281.54 --> 2285.619
churches all these New Covenant style

2283.7 --> 2287.21
churches have to go correctly places and

2285.619 --> 2289.6400000000003
how they operate based churches and

2287.21 --> 2293.41
these things collaborating of churches

2289.64 --> 2297.83
around the world it's very interesting

2293.41 --> 2303.58
it is indeed and I'm very interested in

2297.83 --> 2306.2
it I was a very cautious about it Samiha

2303.58 --> 2308.2999999999997
only so much you can trust but it's a

2306.2 --> 2310.5499999999997
very interesting development as an

2308.3 --> 2313.88
alternative for the corruption of

2310.55 --> 2317.78
society which the standard media is

2313.88 --> 2323.48
becoming so insanely vile just beyond

2317.78 --> 2325.9100000000003
all reason ability just yeah so why not

2323.48 --> 2329.0
you know if the media is gonna drive you

2325.91 --> 2331.49
completely devilishly insane and that's

2329.0 --> 2334.04
very blatant then why not go to a church

2331.49 --> 2337.4599999999996
and just just take the The Annoying

2334.04 --> 2339.23
sides for granted as it were at least

2337.46 --> 2341.359
you'll have people that are trying to be

2339.23 --> 2348.89
decent around you most of the time at

2341.359 --> 2351.83
least yes that is true but you also get

2348.89 --> 2354.3489999999997
some very interesting characters to go

2351.83 --> 2354.89
to the church yes good

2354.349 --> 2358.46
hopefully not

2354.89 --> 2360.519
people they like to go to church - Oh

2358.46 --> 2365.48
left or not situation when they go home

2360.519 --> 2371.47
they're going mad with misbehavior yep

2365.48 --> 2371.47
used to be one of those I didn't really

2374.38 --> 2378.4700000000003
put him by pretty much but it forced me

2377.15 --> 2382.369
from a young age to go to church I was

2378.47 --> 2384.5789999999997
like mm-hmm not working it's mostly the

2382.369 --> 2387.319
bad things about church and the

2384.579 --> 2390.0190000000002
authoritarianism and saying their

2387.319 --> 2393.049
authority declarations that kind of

2390.019 --> 2393.589
makes me want to rebel and like oh yeah

2393.049 --> 2395.599
really

2393.589 --> 2399.14
while screw your rules I'm gonna do

2395.599 --> 2402.5
exactly how I feel because I don't trust

2399.14 --> 2407.69
me really that much how come that I used

2402.5 --> 2410.24
to do that but but now I know better now

2407.69 --> 2412.339
it I know yes it's the church but that

2410.24 --> 2417.3799999999997
doesn't mean that I can be relieved from

2412.339 --> 2419.089
my personal responsibility at the end of

2417.38 --> 2421.299
the day I believe you don't need to go

2419.089 --> 2424.099
to church to believe in religion

2421.299 --> 2427.099
everybody has their own place in it not

2424.099 --> 2428.779
everybody is going to be gonna find God

2427.099 --> 2430.88
in church or find it in other places

2428.779 --> 2433.22
other people need to come to me come to

2430.88 --> 2434.75
a realization of creation vs. creator

2433.22 --> 2436.97
itself themselves

2434.75 --> 2439.19
yeah then oh that's a whole separate

2436.97 --> 2442.549
matter no no one's ever going to

2439.19 --> 2444.65
convince them just some people in my

2442.549 --> 2448.94
opinion and from several angles

2444.65 --> 2451.67
I believe biblically confirming this in

2448.94 --> 2457.039
a direct sense but that basically a

2451.67 --> 2460.42
human is the church you are your spirits

2457.039 --> 2463.039
Church basically you are your own temple

2460.42 --> 2464.9300000000003
you are the carrier of your unique

2463.039 --> 2470.3590000000004
consciousness and spirit and all that

2464.93 --> 2472.49
and so that's how I see every person has

2470.359 --> 2475.49
their own religion and they are their

2472.49 --> 2479.93
own church and you have to take care of

2475.49 --> 2485.1899999999996
it and if others like it then they will

2479.93 --> 2488.7
take on aspects of your examples

2485.19 --> 2491.16
yes I mean there's so many different

2488.7 --> 2493.319
contributed within the shirt system

2491.16 --> 2495.8689999999997
itself I mean the but I think the

2493.319 --> 2498.839
biggest one that takes the cake is the

2495.869 --> 2501.77
Roman Catholics and the Pope Oh God yeah

2498.839 --> 2505.23
well then so that's so blatantly obvious

2501.77 --> 2507.78
but you know but but also if you look at

2505.23 --> 2510.9900000000002
it Napoleon when he in one of his

2507.78 --> 2512.4
battles went to dethrone the Pope

2510.99 --> 2516.41
because they believed the Pope was

2512.4 --> 2516.4100000000003
controlling the political power in Loden

2516.98 --> 2521.73
which is which it doesn't exist which

2519.39 --> 2525.8689999999997
isn't exactly false because the Pope is

2521.73 --> 2527.609
looked after by most governments they

2525.869 --> 2529.109
are connected in the highest circles

2527.609 --> 2531.089
that's how you should see it there's

2529.109 --> 2535.7
just a bit layers and they are in the

2531.089 --> 2537.839
inner inner circles it's only one thing

2535.7 --> 2541.91
when it comes to a pope that I've ever

2537.839 --> 2544.859
disagreed lesson oh really

2541.91 --> 2548.3999999999996
we're in the Pope's handbook he has it

2544.859 --> 2552.0589999999997
he has the like even in the Pope's

2548.4 --> 2555.63
version of the Bible there are nine

2552.059 --> 2557.849
Commandments instead of ten really yes

2555.63 --> 2560.52
and in the Roman Catholic religion as

2557.849 --> 2563.849
well the Pope can intercede on behalf of

2560.52 --> 2566.0389999999998
class to absolve sin making way for

2563.849 --> 2568.8900000000003
himself the having the ability of God to

2566.039 --> 2569.96
absorption which I disagree with that's

2568.89 --> 2572.19
ridiculous

2569.96 --> 2575.67
that's what the Pope believes he has

2572.19 --> 2579.059
throughout of class to absolve sin in

2575.67 --> 2581.16
the name of the name of God according to

2579.059 --> 2585.4500000000003
his petition there's only one way to

2581.16 --> 2588.24
absolve sin and that is to atone yes and

2585.45 --> 2594.96
that is a purely spiritual inner process

2588.24 --> 2598.609
no one can declare atonement yes yet the

2594.96 --> 2601.01
Pope believes he can which is absolutely

2598.609 --> 2605.7889999999998
ridiculous

2601.01 --> 2609.1090000000004
yes but then again the Vatican has

2605.789 --> 2611.76
always been full of self-importance is

2609.109 --> 2613.89
potentially such a thing as communal

2611.76 --> 2617.309
forgiveness but that is purely a social

2613.89 --> 2619.31
quality yes it's really declare that you

2617.309 --> 2622.6800000000003
have the

2619.31 --> 2625.23
this authority of the ultimate designer

2622.68 --> 2628.7999999999997
and his plan for the world and that you

2625.23 --> 2634.35
can just absolve something no you can

2628.8 --> 2636.6800000000003
influence it sure everyone can but no

2634.35 --> 2644.2799999999997
individual has the authority of God

2636.68 --> 2646.97
except Jesus Christ anyway getting

2644.28 --> 2649.02
really really religious

2646.97 --> 2657.12
yeah let's change the subject

2649.02 --> 2661.53
I love I mean if you also look at at

2657.12 --> 2663.75
Vatican City what holds one of the

2661.53 --> 2666.78
biggest underground internet servers in

2663.75 --> 2670.35
the world yeah yeah one of the main hubs

2666.78 --> 2672.3
for the worldwide web I mean and the

2670.35 --> 2675.66
best part is it's both under the

2672.3 --> 2679.98
Vatican's vote what do you think it's

2675.66 --> 2682.6499999999996
doing it's just a fit all data and then

2679.98 --> 2689.79
having the biggest a I ever designed to

2682.65 --> 2694.37
basically all utilize it do you think

2689.79 --> 2698.73
who was the only super AI out there this

2694.37 --> 2700.5899999999997
actually to to super wanted another one

2698.73 --> 2703.2
is in America and the other one is in

2700.59 --> 2708.03
very consider but Vatican city's got the

2703.2 --> 2711.6
biggest one right and what do you think

2708.03 --> 2713.55
they're doing with it they're making a

2711.6 --> 2716.49
god implement knows anything

2713.55 --> 2718.2000000000003
it's information the power of

2716.49 --> 2721.74
information has a lot of value in this

2718.2 --> 2724.89
world you need but not just that

2721.74 --> 2728.7
if you gain oversight and super villains

2724.89 --> 2733.5
and creative powers then you can use

2728.7 --> 2737.52
everyone's ideas as a lifting pad to

2733.5 --> 2739.89
basically make anything right to design

2737.52 --> 2743.34
anything you just gather up the ideas of

2739.89 --> 2746.2799999999997
everyone then you basically all in a

2743.34 --> 2748.08
fifth dimensional way reconstruct how to

2746.28 --> 2751.0690000000004
properly apply what they were thinking

2748.08 --> 2752.8089999999997
of to refine you know and to actually

2751.069 --> 2756.38
like yeah okay let's just build this

2752.809 --> 2759.4100000000003
incredible I don't know multi-dimension

2756.38 --> 2763.969
like anything it could probably make

2759.41 --> 2765.769
anything you know at the end of the day

2763.969 --> 2767.63
at the end of the day if you look at the

2765.769 --> 2770.4199999999996
state of the world information and

2767.63 --> 2774.739
knowledge is power to the world and the

2770.42 --> 2777.319
way it operates men or abuse the fact

2774.739 --> 2778.819
that they can dumb people down but

2777.319 --> 2781.069
making them believe other things that

2778.819 --> 2782.449
are irrelevant and take the hours of

2781.069 --> 2785.869
what is happening in the world of that

2782.449 --> 2787.7490000000003
and then putting both troops in their

2785.869 --> 2794.2090000000003
faces

2787.749 --> 2796.3089999999997
sorry well a lot of what they a lot of

2794.209 --> 2797.839
well the controversy comes around a lot

2796.309 --> 2799.94
of things because so many people post

2797.839 --> 2802.999
false truths to blind people to the

2799.94 --> 2804.89
situation in the world what's going on

2802.999 --> 2807.8289999999997
around them I mean all this negativity

2804.89 --> 2810.529
they posed always blonde truths which

2807.829 --> 2812.9590000000003
are actually the sections to keep people

2810.529 --> 2814.19
dumb down to the Swit and what is

2812.959 --> 2817.029
happening in the world around them

2814.19 --> 2821.029
basically of course distractions

2817.029 --> 2825.38
distractions of battle in the world

2821.029 --> 2828.729
today of course but that's to be

2825.38 --> 2831.589
expected with an information revolution

2828.729 --> 2834.1989999999996
it's like it's like the term controlled

2831.589 --> 2834.949
chaos that's all they're doing is

2834.199 --> 2836.9590000000003
controlled chaos

2834.949 --> 2839.63
could you imagine that the internet

2836.959 --> 2842.9199999999996
would only have true things in it and

2839.63 --> 2845.719
that all the [ __ ] would all be gone

2842.92 --> 2854.66
they imagine how smart that internet

2845.719 --> 2857.66
will be not much info there is right as

2854.66 --> 2861.14
much you know not wait not when you

2857.66 --> 2864.0789999999997
click on Google you've got over 200,000

2861.14 --> 2871.3689999999997
responses oh gosh now which one do I

2864.079 --> 2874.069
click on first page but usually Google

2871.369 --> 2876.109
is is so cocky these days that they

2874.069 --> 2881.069
predict even when you start tapping your

2876.109 --> 2884.529
first letter I think it's cool

2881.069 --> 2886.72
yeah but I was a thing but it's all to

2884.529 --> 2890.559
do with that that I have I'd may develop

2886.72 --> 2892.24
to pick up what people search and how

2890.559 --> 2895.3590000000004
they search different people's

2892.24 --> 2899.3489999999997
personalities to suggest for them what

2895.359 --> 2902.17
they would seem relevant well you have

2899.349 --> 2904.69
to imagine that your computer and

2902.17 --> 2909.309
everything that you're working with all

2904.69 --> 2912.309
has their own sensory input that Google

2909.309 --> 2913.9
can use so if you're gonna talk about

2912.309 --> 2916.7490000000003
something even though you're not typing

2913.9 --> 2919.029
anything it will have registered that

2916.749 --> 2920.47
and if you then type that into Google it

2919.029 --> 2922.9
will know all right you're talking about

2920.47 --> 2926.6189999999997
this right bang that's why you get it in

2922.9 --> 2929.349
the first letter because the internet of

2926.619 --> 2931.839
all things besides your computer in your

2929.349 --> 2935.4700000000003
actual internet connection there is just

2931.839 --> 2940.8089999999997
information connection everywhere ready

2935.47 --> 2944.3799999999997
for the people that's a reality it's

2940.809 --> 2946.69
been a reality for over 10 years in all

2944.38 --> 2949.289
of the Western world pretty much and

2946.69 --> 2951.369
with the way that technology of bowls

2949.289 --> 2959.0490000000004
it's gonna get even bigger

2951.369 --> 2961.859
at this rate so yeah we got about seven

2959.049 --> 2965.739
more minutes before the debates start

2961.859 --> 2967.5389999999998
