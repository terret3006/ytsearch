donation

121.24 --> 124.88
always very helpful thank you very much

123.28 --> 127.0
for

124.88 --> 129.399
that

127.0 --> 134.52
right weather today

129.399 --> 134.52
is seems kind of nice th

135.239 --> 141.76
far there's some big clouds out there

139.0 --> 141.76
kind of beautiful

145.239 --> 150.76
looking but

147.879 --> 154.84
uh yeah there's

150.76 --> 158.16
there's some clear sky and some like

154.84 --> 161.08
fluff fluffy looking clouds that are

158.16 --> 166.159
like higher than these big clouds it's

161.08 --> 166.15900000000002
like very varied looking

167.239 --> 173.72
Sky webcam seems ah there you

170.72 --> 175.08
go webcam had a little trouble focusing

173.72 --> 179.92
on

175.08 --> 179.92000000000002
that but yeah look at that

186.12 --> 188.84
looks kind of

189.159 --> 195.879
spectacular all right there's the sun is

192.319 --> 195.879
still coming through all that

197.159 --> 201.879
so it is kind of nice

229.84 --> 236.879
right so it's Thursday the 30th of May

233.879 --> 236.879
2024

243.439 --> 249.4
temperature is 18Â°

245.799 --> 252.15900000000002
c ah with only 9% precipitation that's

249.4 --> 252.159
better than

252.92 --> 257.959
100% right 63% humidity

262.479 --> 268.96
still all right so seems like it's going

265.08 --> 268.96
to be kind of nice weather

291.919 --> 296.88
right so yeah yesterday I

294.44 --> 300.639
uh I quit the

296.88 --> 302.8
show and usually early for my

300.639 --> 305.72
doing

302.8 --> 309.039
because

305.72 --> 312.0
well nobody none of my wrenches none of

309.039 --> 315.68
my you regulars showed up and like the

312.0 --> 319.52
entire show was quite disappointed

315.68 --> 321.96
really cuz I do actually appreciate if

319.52 --> 326.24
you guys are around during the

321.96 --> 326.23999999999995
show cuz I trust you

326.759 --> 332.28000000000003
and it it yeah it helps me not

330.96 --> 337.75899999999996
basically end

332.28 --> 340.35999999999996
up stranded in a ditch somewhere

337.759 --> 341.52000000000004
metaphorically so did get a lot of

340.36 --> 344.88
feedback

341.52 --> 347.19899999999996
though afterward people basically making

344.88 --> 349.6
excuses why they could be there and it's

347.199 --> 352.0
like okay fine

349.6 --> 354.36
work everybody was apparently really

352.0 --> 354.36
busy

354.84 --> 360.75899999999996
yesterday and I yeah it's not bad or

358.8 --> 364.759
anything I mean glad glad you guys are

360.759 --> 364.759
having work and that keeps you

369.12 --> 376.4
busy yeah but energy

373.44 --> 381.639
wise it just seemed kind of like a shame

376.4 --> 381.63899999999995
because I was like totally totally

382.28 --> 387.08
focused just ready to basically start

385.16 --> 389.72
answering questions and everything and

387.08 --> 393.52
and just like yeah

389.72 --> 393.52000000000004
it seemed to just grind to a

393.8 --> 400.16
halt and I fight yeah I kind of felt

396.919 --> 402.79999999999995
demoralized about

400.16 --> 405.8
that and that lasted for a couple of

402.8 --> 408.52000000000004
hours by the way so I really hope that

405.8 --> 412.84000000000003
today is going to be different Hello voy

408.52 --> 412.84
first the chat good to see you

424.8 --> 431.24
right but I also realized like it's

428.759 --> 435.56
probably because of my own

431.24 --> 438.0
expectations this is well obviously now

435.56 --> 439.919
the summer vacation period that's pretty

438.0 --> 442.56
much arrived so a lot of people are

439.919 --> 446.71999999999997
going to be sleeping

442.56 --> 451.879
later or going to be busy

446.72 --> 451.879
with other stuff like that it's just

455.0 --> 460.52
happens

457.039 --> 460.52
so need to

462.479 --> 468.44
be need to figure out how to like

466.039 --> 470.919
basically rearrange what I do in order

468.44 --> 474.68
to keep

470.919 --> 479.19899999999996
going and not have a massive expectation

474.68 --> 479.199
of who's going to actually show up

480.319 --> 483.56
although I still really do hope that you

482.12 --> 487.24
will show

483.56 --> 487.24
up like Foy

496.879 --> 502.03900000000004
here right and probably keeping that in

499.599 --> 505.159
mind I need to take it easy with the

502.039 --> 507.36
coffee so yeah I've been making a habit

505.159 --> 510.84
of starting out the show with coffee and

507.36 --> 514.2
Illuminati cant right away

510.84 --> 516.68
and this time I consciously like no

514.2 --> 520.8000000000001
let's not do that right

516.68 --> 520.8
away let's just stick to a bit of

521.8 --> 526.519
minty and just take it

530.0 --> 533.72
easy let's see what

534.279 --> 537.72
happens it's been a couple of

536.24 --> 540.72
interesting videos that I've been

537.72 --> 540.72
watching

545.56 --> 554.16
FL Sage posted this video that it's like

549.04 --> 554.16
the l l luran

555.44 --> 563.5600000000001
race just like part of the uh Rudolph

559.16 --> 567.1999999999999
Steiner back yeah ancient past cosmology

563.56 --> 570.88
it's very interesting I've heard of it

567.2 --> 575.72
before but it's really real in a

570.88 --> 575.72
way like I'm I have a lot of trouble

577.0 --> 582.56
like it's not even like like I can't

579.399 --> 582.56
imagine it it's just

589.16 --> 596.1999999999999
that it's kind of tough to

592.48 --> 596.2
realize to really

596.279 --> 602.72
properly yeah like I there I have some

600.079 --> 602.7199999999999
doubts with

604.04 --> 610.12
it but like I can't just say like oh I'm

607.64 --> 612.6
going to like oh that means that I don't

610.12 --> 617.76
I can't entertain it at all it just

612.6 --> 617.76
means I have to then instead understand

617.959 --> 622.8
why because everything is

620.72 --> 625.64
something can't

622.8 --> 629.3199999999999
just not accept it and then not figure

625.64 --> 629.3199999999999
out what it is

635.279 --> 641.76
because I think there's a big chance

637.44 --> 644.8000000000001
overall that in his actual attempt to

641.76 --> 647.8
well attempt in his

644.8 --> 647.8
nonstop

647.839 --> 652.519
verbalizing his understanding and his

654.8 --> 661.399
insights he's always very focused on the

658.959 --> 663.5189999999999
mind in the internal world and spirit

661.399 --> 666.079
and all that and the details of that

663.519 --> 669.04
Spirit cosmology is very

666.079 --> 672.4799999999999
extensive so I've always considered that

669.04 --> 674.5999999999999
there would be technically a risk that

672.48 --> 677.9590000000001
if he's going to like try

674.6 --> 680.12
to figure out back engineer what's

677.959 --> 683.6389999999999
happened in the ancient past

680.12 --> 684.88
that because of his focus on spiritual

683.639 --> 687.36
matters in the

684.88 --> 691.079
Ethereal

687.36 --> 694.6800000000001
that he would natur end up with the

691.079 --> 694.68
actual Spiritual

695.88 --> 703.519
Development and

697.959 --> 703.5189999999999
that the physical side would be more

704.079 --> 712.519
elusive it's it's just very

708.839 --> 714.2
complicated to properly size up the the

712.519 --> 717.519
ideas but they are absolutely

714.2 --> 721.24
fascinating basically claiming that in

717.519 --> 721.24
the original far past that

721.68 --> 727.519
people have

724.279 --> 729.92
like what would you call that not

727.519 --> 732.639
mutative because that's like actual

729.92 --> 735.399
physical change permanently and

732.639 --> 738.639
structural change but like adaptive

735.399 --> 738.639
qualities where you can

739.16 --> 745.88
like comes very close to shape changing

742.079 --> 749.56
basically it's really fascinating also

745.88 --> 752.399
his me like in that luran race video

749.56 --> 756.16
I'll just post it you guys could watch

752.399 --> 759.44
it too thank you flatter Sage for

756.16 --> 759.4399999999999
bringing this video to my

760.56 --> 768.0
attention also inserting the idea that

764.88 --> 770.76
it it's just absolutely

768.0 --> 774.399
fascinating that in the ancient past

770.76 --> 775.88
like in Luman times that like the entire

774.399 --> 777.959
condition of the Earth was different

775.88 --> 779.639
that Not only was there higher air

777.959 --> 783.3599999999999
pressure

779.639 --> 785.6
but that he says that like all the Earth

783.36 --> 790.6
all the rock all the minerals were all

785.6 --> 790.6
softer Metals too just

792.16 --> 797.76
like there are ideas like that out there

801.0 --> 808.199
now cuz there are some places where it

803.56 --> 811.4799999999999
just seems like The Rock was just putty

808.199 --> 813.76
and that people just is like B very

811.48 --> 817.9200000000001
simple carvings in it and and and just

813.76 --> 817.92
like we can't make sense of that

819.639 --> 829.0
anyway except if it was all just kind of

823.639 --> 831.8
putty at the start it just it's very dis

829.0 --> 835.079
difficult to like grasp the overall

831.8 --> 837.0799999999999
logical consequences of entertaining

835.079 --> 840.289
such an oce

837.08 --> 840.289
[Music]

844.44 --> 850.0790000000001
but that was in there as well so it's

847.279 --> 853.72
like fascinating

850.079 --> 857.04
insights that are very

853.72 --> 861.6
relevant in our attempts to reconstruct

857.04 --> 867.5999999999999
the past back engineer figure out how it

861.6 --> 871.0400000000001
really happen everything creation

867.6 --> 871.0400000000001
anyway uh

874.12 --> 879.36
24 watching okay I got people's

877.04 --> 883.199
attention anybody else would show up in

879.36 --> 883.1990000000001
chat that would be great

908.48 --> 913.399
right there was this other video I just

910.959 --> 913.399
bumped

914.959 --> 920.16
into about light again very very strange

918.36 --> 922.88
it was a bit of a baller it had to

920.16 --> 926.4399999999999
involve comparing things to planets

922.88 --> 926.4399999999999
comparing electrons to

926.959 --> 935.7589999999999
planets but uh yeah about light again

930.319 --> 939.5999999999999
and nitrogen light specifically and like

935.759 --> 940.8000000000001
it was an interesting video some strange

939.6 --> 943.399
things with

940.8 --> 946.16
light and then all the physics

943.399 --> 948.959
explanations to explain a way how this

946.16 --> 948.959
is supposed to

952.04 --> 958.279
work I mean the idea of like bumping an

955.319 --> 961.279
electron to another layer and that

958.279 --> 963.399
causes a Photon to be released right

961.279 --> 965.6
that's like a model that's like

963.399 --> 967.959
predominantly

965.6 --> 971.1990000000001
mentioned in this video I'll just share

967.959 --> 971.199
that video as well why

975.48 --> 980.9200000000001
not yeah make sure that's not the same

981.36 --> 986.639
video but I mean these are models these

984.319 --> 989.88
are ideas of

986.639 --> 992.29
it like to give a bit of an oversight on

989.88 --> 998.46
how that works

992.29 --> 998.4599999999999
[Music]

1001.279 --> 1005.079
but it's just kind of

1009.8 --> 1014.319
odd like what that

1017.199 --> 1023.24
does cuz in this video is like take a

1020.8 --> 1027.24
little flame and then expose the whole

1023.24 --> 1029.4
thing to nitrogen light and like that

1027.24 --> 1031.88
nitrogen is the exclusive light and that

1029.4 --> 1035.3190000000002
is actually so

1031.88 --> 1036.5200000000002
lowlighted low lighted so such a low

1035.319 --> 1038.48
frequency

1036.52 --> 1041.439
light

1038.48 --> 1044.439
I probably need to rewatch it to get it

1041.439 --> 1044.439
straight

1045.76 --> 1049.959
that that it's

1054.24 --> 1059.16
I'm not sure anymore basically it comes

1056.16 --> 1061.1200000000001
down to in that video that because of

1059.16 --> 1063.76
the

1061.12 --> 1067.3999999999999
lighting like the flame doesn't give off

1063.76 --> 1070.52
any light it only absorbs the light it's

1067.4 --> 1070.52
just really

1070.64 --> 1076.3200000000002
bizarre oh yeah and it evolves the

1073.52 --> 1079.08
nitrogen lamp I mean it's light is just

1076.32 --> 1081.6
such a weird thing

1079.08 --> 1084.6
might have to like rewatch that video to

1081.6 --> 1088.12
get it straight again like what exactly

1084.6 --> 1088.12
it is that's happening in

1089.4 --> 1094.4
there but yeah it was very interesting

1092.2 --> 1097.039
so sometimes YouTube does recommend

1094.4 --> 1097.039
interesting

1107.76 --> 1111.76
videos for

1141.72 --> 1146.08
it's been another couple of videos but I

1143.679 --> 1149.64
haven't really got to watching

1146.08 --> 1153.24
them how chemical science more videos

1149.64 --> 1154.8400000000001
about the plasmoid thunderstorm

1153.24 --> 1157.039
generation

1154.84 --> 1158.6399999999999
generators public demo I haven't

1157.039 --> 1161.6
actually checked that out but I I kind

1158.64 --> 1165.6000000000001
of want to see what that's

1161.6 --> 1165.6
about uh

1169.82 --> 1172.8799999999999
[Music]

1184.0 --> 1188.159
all right so don't forget to share the

1185.72 --> 1191.08
show and Rogan's it up

1188.159 --> 1194.0800000000002
and if all possible say hello in the

1191.08 --> 1194.08
chat

1201.12 --> 1204.2399999999998
[Music]

1207.01 --> 1210.799
[Music]

1221.4 --> 1226.4
hey fiber outs good to see you man how

1224.2 --> 1226.4
you

1227.24 --> 1231.32
doing after work all

1234.08 --> 1237.9189999999999
right thanks for stopping

1252.52 --> 1260.36
by yeah by the way that painting video I

1256.919 --> 1264.5590000000002
played of you from you that you put in

1260.36 --> 1266.6399999999999
Skype like I had to YouTube literally

1264.559 --> 1268.28
yeah blocked the video from some

1266.64 --> 1273.48

[Music]

2016.96 --> 2022.08
understand my frustration yeah thanks I

2019.12 --> 2025.639
mean it it is also just

2022.08 --> 2025.639
like I don't know

2026.96 --> 2032.44
man General loneliness I think

2058.159 --> 2063.8
and like the the summer period and all

2060.839 --> 2066.72
that and I'm just like I don't know it's

2063.8 --> 2070.679
it's a little bit tougher on me than

2066.72 --> 2070.6789999999996
normal for

2112.119 --> 2119.44
all right but anyway yeah that video you

2116.76 --> 2121.28
posted in the middle of the night was

2119.44 --> 2124.4
really interesting I did watch it before

2121.28 --> 2124.4
the show

2131.48 --> 2138.2
it's a a pretty good reading of it like

2135.079 --> 2142.04
somebody just reading the

2138.2 --> 2142.04
book was very

2146.8 --> 2155.2400000000002
interesting and I had like I do remember

2151.4 --> 2159.96
having read or somebody telling me

2155.24 --> 2163.839
reading it out about the Lor race the

2159.96 --> 2163.839
the Lian race

2164.44 --> 2167.44
before

2167.72 --> 2171.56
like it's very

2173.0 --> 2178.04
strange but very rutal Steiner

2188.359 --> 2192.7599999999998
I just I just wonder if it's like

2191.359 --> 2196.04
actually

2192.76 --> 2200.3190000000004
physically real or if it is

2196.04 --> 2203.2
rather like other states of the spirit

2200.319 --> 2205.88
like is he talking about the same

2203.2 --> 2205.8799999999997
Physical

2206.04 --> 2209.8
Realm like how does it

2209.96 --> 2212.96
work

2214.96 --> 2219.76
yeah cuz rudol Stein is always so focus

2218.04 --> 2222.7599999999998
on Spiritual

2219.76 --> 2222.76
Development

2225.4 --> 2230.56
that like he gets those structures like

2229.24 --> 2234.0
really

2230.56 --> 2236.88
well but with this it's just

2234.0 --> 2241.56
like I just don't know I don't know for

2236.88 --> 2244.52
sure have had doubts it's like it's so

2241.56 --> 2248.2
different from other ways of looking at

2244.52 --> 2250.4
it like inherently

2248.2 --> 2252.56
accepting that there's like physical

2250.4 --> 2253.839
changes to like the nature of matter

2252.56 --> 2255.52
even I mean

2253.839 --> 2258.52
that's

2255.52 --> 2258.52
heavy

2267.68 --> 2273.44
literally deeper connection with nature

2270.68 --> 2278.9199999999996
well it's just completely

2273.44 --> 2278.92
different even like physically malleable

2290.88 --> 2295.2000000000003
most the videos are way too long yeah I

2306.44 --> 2310.48
bet for

2340.52 --> 2345.079
why didn't they teach you this in school

2343.0 --> 2348.0
yeah because it doesn't exactly fit the

2345.079 --> 2349.599
narrative and the history and all

2348.0 --> 2354.96
that

2349.599 --> 2354.96
that's it's very unorthodox

2388.52 --> 2392.96
right but I bet that like in Waldorf

2391.04 --> 2395.599
schools you do

2392.96 --> 2397.7200000000003
actually probably at the

2395.599 --> 2401.119
higher like the Middle School schol and

2397.72 --> 2403.4399999999996
all that they probably do actually teach

2401.119 --> 2403.44
you

2413.92 --> 2416.92
this

2417.079 --> 2420.8
oh what

2421.359 --> 2429.319
uh wait you mean which video clutch you

2425.48 --> 2429.319
mean the the Walter Russell

2430.48 --> 2435.04
that

2431.599 --> 2437.4
one cuz there was a lot of silliness in

2435.04 --> 2437.4
there I

2447.04 --> 2451.88
mean wa let me check out

2452.24 --> 2457.56
again I

2454.92 --> 2463.359
mean anything that's going to say the

2457.56 --> 2463.359
genius behind Terren Howard is like

2464.16 --> 2470.319
yikes but I mean yeah Walter Russell is

2467.2 --> 2470.319
very interesting

2472.16 --> 2476.92
though but I mean I've always thought

2475.16 --> 2480.2
that Walter Russell's like kind of

2476.92 --> 2480.2000000000003
surreal in a way

2483.2 --> 2489.2
it's it's all about patterns but it's

2485.96 --> 2492.839
like it's not con

2489.2 --> 2492.839
exclusive it it just

2494.839 --> 2499.7999999999997
isn't the static in thetic yeah yeah

2497.28 --> 2502.119
yeah I know that that's the one that I'm

2499.8 --> 2502.119
talking

2508.359 --> 2512.92
about different races

2527.44 --> 2533.76
seven races of

2529.76 --> 2533.76
mankind what

2557.4 --> 2562.359
is that all described in that video cuz

2560.359 --> 2564.88
yeah then I should really just watch it

2562.359 --> 2564.88
it's just

2569.24 --> 2577.68
that by the way he miss spelled genius

2572.4 --> 2581.6800000000003
it said spelled gen genus it it

2577.68 --> 2581.68
yeah that kind of put me

2587.88 --> 2594.319
off it wasn't about Howard okay that's

2591.8 --> 2597.88
cool okay I will check it

2594.319 --> 2600.48
out I I didn't get to it just been too

2597.88 --> 2603.7200000000003
distracted with other things

2600.48 --> 2607.079
glutch but

2603.72 --> 2610.0789999999997
yeah I mean I know about Walter Russell

2607.079 --> 2610.079
for

2657.559 --> 2660.559
five

2666.04 --> 2670.079
okay e

2698.68 --> 2705.7599999999998
H yeah clutch that might be you're

2703.0 --> 2707.48
right there's something about it like I

2705.76 --> 2709.44
don't really like that channel super

2707.48 --> 2711.52
much I get it that you're into it and

2709.44 --> 2714.52
I'm not saying like that's bad or

2711.52 --> 2714.52
anything it's just

2714.96 --> 2723.2400000000002
that it doesn't seem to like really like

2718.48 --> 2723.2400000000002
first glance appeal to me much

2731.92 --> 2735.2000000000003
skeptical about these

2742.839 --> 2751.2
races yeah so am I clutch that that's

2748.48 --> 2751.2
the thing

2751.24 --> 2757.0
like like are they really different

2754.28 --> 2759.28
races like what actually caused the TR

2757.0 --> 2761.64
transformation then I mean it it's it's

2759.28 --> 2761.6400000000003
very

2761.92 --> 2768.0
strange it sounds like Evolution but

2765.28 --> 2771.7200000000003
like divinely guided or

2768.0 --> 2771.72
something and it it's

2773.0 --> 2778.839
weird but yeah as flatter say sage says

2776.88 --> 2781.96
there it does seem like this is more

2778.839 --> 2786.2
about like the spiritual

2781.96 --> 2786.2
state of people

2791.52 --> 2797.319
hey Clary good to see

2793.68 --> 2801.319

here

3045.88 --> 3051.6800000000003
cheers Illuminati is still hot

3060.04 --> 3067.24
were I able to work out if a phoenix

3062.64 --> 3067.24
event occurred after the eclipse

3069.24 --> 3074.4799999999996
well it's not even two months after it I

3076.359 --> 3079.359
mean

3080.88 --> 3087.88
right I feel it's still inbound I mean

3084.839 --> 3090.2799999999997
it I never said that is would just like

3087.88 --> 3092.559
oh yeah in in one or two weeks time

3090.28 --> 3097.52
suddenly everything

3092.559 --> 3097.52
changes but I mean stuff has happened

3099.96 --> 3106.48
though the tension is higher so I mean

3103.799 --> 3109.4
this the Phoenix event can still happen

3106.48 --> 3114.48
it can absolutely still

3109.4 --> 3114.48
happen the year is not over yet

3125.72 --> 3128.359
hello moon

3140.31 --> 3146.839
[Music]

3142.96 --> 3149.079
rover said after the eclipse yeah well

3146.839 --> 3151.64
what the Phoenix event basically is is a

3149.079 --> 3154.88
restoration of ancestral memory that's

3151.64 --> 3154.8799999999997
what I said that would

3158.119 --> 3162.839
happen that could lead

3160.17 --> 3166.44
[Music]

3162.839 --> 3168.7599999999998
to yeah this the stopping of the machine

3166.44 --> 3168.76
out

3169.079 --> 3176.2000000000003
there the evil Marxist

3173.16 --> 3177.0
machine and yeah I mean the Awakening

3176.2 --> 3179.96
part

3177.0 --> 3179.96
probably already

3188.24 --> 3193.52
happened but the actual results of that

3191.28 --> 3195.2400000000002
I mean yeah you don't know how long

3193.52 --> 3198.44
that's going to take it

3195.24 --> 3202.04
probably going to be around the American

3198.44 --> 3203.64
elections and all that some yeah I don't

3202.04 --> 3208.079
know it doesn't seem like there's some

3203.64 --> 3208.0789999999997
kind of direct action plan

3208.44 --> 3212.799
in the meantime the dark Forces are like

3210.839 --> 3215.5589999999997
trying to just keep pushing it and

3212.799 --> 3219.2
pushing it harder and

3215.559 --> 3219.2000000000003
harder getting more

3222.48 --> 3228.68
egregious yeah trying to heat up this

3225.319 --> 3233.04
war with Russia I mean NATO is just

3228.68 --> 3233.04
being absolutely terrible

3243.359 --> 3245.5989999999997
right

3246.16 --> 3252.7599999999998
and the assassination attempt of the

3249.44 --> 3256.559
Slovakian prime minister and all that I

3252.76 --> 3259.4
mean [Â __Â ] has gone down let's be

3256.559 --> 3262.0400000000004
fair including the Iranian prime

3259.4 --> 3266.04
minister's helicopter that also went

3262.04 --> 3266.04
down so

3272.28 --> 3275.559
you can't say nothing's

3277.28 --> 3284.4
happening right and over here man I mean

3281.119 --> 3287.0
like it's getting more obvious now that

3284.4 --> 3289.119
even this Girt Wilders as they love to

3287.0 --> 3292.839
say his name in

3289.119 --> 3294.96
America like that that he also it just

3292.839 --> 3297.319
seems more and more like an actual deep

3294.96 --> 3302.16
State Control opposition like it's being

3305.92 --> 3311.599
happening but we're not defeated yet

3309.119 --> 3314.04

3311.599 --> 3317.559
the Netherlands that are like they're

3314.04 --> 3317.5589999999997

hello

3788.039 --> 3796.559
o tot Le

3791.4 --> 3796.559
flirting yeah B Smith is I remember

3802.2 --> 3806.96
that yeah the good old days

3823.4 --> 3828.48
got kicked out of a council

3825.599 --> 3830.839
meeting demanding to talk about it okay

3828.48 --> 3830.839
that is

3834.72 --> 3838.7599999999998
weird e

3886.76 --> 3889.76
uh

3902.96 --> 3907.48
that was when she was dating Mark what

3905.52 --> 3909.92
are you talking about dating Mark

3907.48 --> 3913.319
Sergeant they didn't

3909.92 --> 3917.2000000000003
date there was just endless rumors that

3913.319 --> 3919.72
they thought was kind of funny to

3917.2 --> 3922.7599999999998
like reinforce

3919.72 --> 3926.279
that those rumors but I mean they didn't

3922.76 --> 3926.279
actually date

3929.4 --> 3934.92
people just wanted them to date and they

3931.599 --> 3937.44
were like yeah maybe we're dating they

3934.92 --> 3940.319
were just playing around they they

3937.44 --> 3940.319
didn't actually

3941.319 --> 3946.68
date or if they did then it's like their

3944.319 --> 3949.359
little secret that nobody that they will

3946.68 --> 3951.0789999999997
never really tell I don't know man I

3949.359 --> 3953.0789999999997
don't think they really dated it didn't

3951.079 --> 3956.6400000000003
seem like it it seemed like they were

3953.079 --> 3956.6400000000003
just playing around

3970.319 --> 3976.96
that's right flatter Sage but swor said

3973.119 --> 3978.599
they were there yeah but as I said I

3976.96 --> 3981.64
think that they were kind of like

3978.599 --> 3981.6400000000003
playing around with

3982.64 --> 3989.319
it like they were almost going to date

3985.68 --> 3993.68
but then just like didn't really do

3989.319 --> 3993.68
it but everybody wanted them

3995.24 --> 4001.2
to guess you just

3998.2 --> 4003.72
assumed yeah because it was the vibe was

4001.2 --> 4005.48
there and like everybody wanted them to

4003.72 --> 4011.16
like it's

4005.48 --> 4011.16
yeah so you probably picked up on that

4026.76 --> 4030.3190000000004
What The Hell by the way Al what is

4028.96 --> 4035.2
triggering

4030.319 --> 4035.2
you what are you talking about

4055.319 --> 4062.92
yeah exactly flare Sage all

4058.44 --> 4065.599
that the Challenger non oh okay why is

4062.92 --> 4069.119
that triggering I

4065.599 --> 4072.44
mean isn't it

4069.119 --> 4072.44
obvious it's

4072.96 --> 4081.559
like when you're like an acting

4076.88 --> 4084.319
Guild you can't actually just get people

4081.559 --> 4084.3190000000004
killed in

4086.039 --> 4091.76
accidents like when you do

4088.799 --> 4093.72
that and yeah effectively get people

4091.76 --> 4097.0
that are involved in on secrets and

4093.72 --> 4099.639999999999
keeping secrets killed well then like

4097.0 --> 4101.04
their family is probably caught on it

4099.64 --> 4105.159000000001
they're like they're going to spill the

4101.04 --> 4108.4
beans right it's like if you get a

4105.159 --> 4113.5599999999995
person that's in on a big act like that

4108.4 --> 4113.5599999999995
key position if you like literally kill

4113.799 --> 4121.2789999999995
them that's like lighting a

4116.839 --> 4124.239
match at a gas station right I mean or

4121.279 --> 4125.719
right next to a gas tank because like

4124.239 --> 4128.4
everybody is going to then start

4125.719 --> 4131.52
spilling the beans because person got

4128.4 --> 4134.5199999999995
killed so like they can't actually do

4131.52 --> 4134.52
that

4137.279 --> 4143.279
if somebody's going to get killed in

4139.08 --> 4145.239
like this story The Space story then

4143.279 --> 4148.1990000000005
it's going to be like a thing that

4145.239 --> 4150.48
happens like another event and it has to

4148.199 --> 4152.799
be faked they can't actually get these

4150.48 --> 4155.4
people killed they couldn't afford

4152.799 --> 4155.4
risking

4156.279 --> 4162.040000000001
that so then they all turn out to have

4159.04 --> 4162.04
twins

4173.12 --> 4179.799
hey Optimus good see you wow the chat's

4175.759 --> 4179.799
really buzzing today thank you so much

4181.64 --> 4188.359
everybody really restored

4184.359 --> 4188.359
faith my faith in the

4189.48 --> 4195.48
chat cuz yesterday man I mean yesterday

4193.04 --> 4198.4
I had great energy but then there's just

4195.48 --> 4201.12
nobody there and that was

4198.4 --> 4202.5599999999995
terrible I mean and I'm not I don't want

4201.12 --> 4206.159
to blame you it's probably

4202.56 --> 4206.159000000001
circumstantial but it's just

4206.48 --> 4213.159
like I just felt like I was this

4210.32 --> 4216.96
optimally chared battery with nothing to

4213.159 --> 4216.96
discharge on it felt

4220.04 --> 4226.0
terrible right Hello Health lunabar good

4222.679 --> 4226.0
to see you

4242.679 --> 4245.96
but keep their names the

4246.28 --> 4249.28
same

4250.48 --> 4255.48
because those people probably

4255.84 --> 4262.1990000000005
there's the thing they might have like

4258.679 --> 4265.719
been sort of forced into it like you're

4262.199 --> 4268.12
going to die but we don't want to die

4265.719 --> 4270.28
like they never asked for that so then

4268.12 --> 4272.199
it's like okay then we have to we just

4270.28 --> 4274.599999999999
have to keep our

4272.199 --> 4277.28
names we want to keep our names

4274.6 --> 4281.159000000001
basically be the same

4277.28 --> 4283.599999999999
person and like that they had to then do

4281.159 --> 4285.759999999999
it so it's like yeah that makes the

4283.6 --> 4287.84
whole thing crazy well

4285.76 --> 4291.6
those astronauts from the Challenger

4287.84 --> 4295.32
probably never asked to be part of that

4291.6 --> 4298.639
event of it blowing

4295.32 --> 4301.32
up so the government had to like kind of

4298.639 --> 4305.04
negotiate like how that was going to

4301.32 --> 4305.04
roll out that's what I think

4309.679 --> 4316.2390000000005
happened it's disgusting why is it

4312.52 --> 4316.2390000000005
disgusting Oz

4318.639 --> 4323.56
wouldn't you be glad that they didn't

4320.84 --> 4323.56
actually get

4324.6 --> 4329.639
killed and I

4327.04 --> 4333.04
mean government does this sort of thing

4329.639 --> 4337.36
all the time it's called like

4333.04 --> 4340.5199999999995
yeah a crisis act they fake something

4337.36 --> 4343.08
terrible happening and I mean dude they

4340.52 --> 4345.6
literally like shove the television in

4343.08 --> 4348.44
front of kids everywhere just to show

4345.6 --> 4351.120000000001
them that it was going to blow up I mean

4348.44 --> 4355.199
that is pretty much what you would do

4351.12 --> 4357.719
with a crisis act you want the impact to

4355.199 --> 4357.719
to go

4358.08 --> 4363.28
around you can't deal with it well I'm

4360.56 --> 4365.96
very sorry

4363.28 --> 4369.44
lumor but uh

4365.96 --> 4371.52
yeah government and and government

4369.44 --> 4374.5199999999995
adjacent organizations do this sort of

4371.52 --> 4374.52
thing

4382.4 --> 4387.239
they probably had to do that just to

4385.12 --> 4391.719
like discontinue the

4387.239 --> 4395.718999999999
hopes to to make up an official excuse

4391.719 --> 4398.639
just so they wouldn't have to

4395.719 --> 4400.04
continue actually building towards

4398.639 --> 4402.56
accomplishing

4400.04 --> 4406.679
everything that they were all set out to

4402.56 --> 4406.679
do because they can't

4409.48 --> 4414.12
so like the Challenger would have been

4411.28 --> 4416.5599999999995
as a ritual like a designated bummer

4414.12 --> 4419.08
moment like this is supposed to bum

4416.56 --> 4419.080000000001
everybody

4419.88 --> 4423.8
out so that people

4425.08 --> 4432.0
would either think it's all nonsense

4429.639 --> 4435.4400000000005
like to do invest the money in space

4432.0 --> 4439.679
program or at least be an excuse like

4435.44 --> 4445.04
yeah so there too much damage

4439.679 --> 4445.04
now just as an excuse to discontinue

4492.28 --> 4498.44
what doesn't make sense what doesn't

4494.639 --> 4498.4400000000005
make sense s to you

4528.159 --> 4533.879999999999
okay so it doesn't make sense to you

4530.6 --> 4538.88
that this junith

4533.88 --> 4538.88
rasnik you Professor had a massive law

4539.28 --> 4544.759999999999
career during the time why is

4545.04 --> 4552.04
that I mean what they can't create a

4549.36 --> 4552.04
background

4553.4 --> 4558.719
Story I mean if going to plan something

4556.56 --> 4561.88
like the Challenger event which would

4558.719 --> 4563.92
have been planned to do that what you

4561.88 --> 4565.4800000000005
think that they can't anticipate like oh

4563.92 --> 4568.12
we're going to have to create a

4565.48 --> 4570.799999999999
fictional background for these

4568.12 --> 4572.5599999999995
people for something that's technically

4570.8 --> 4575.76
not happened

4572.56 --> 4579.0
yet yeah they can plan that of course

4575.76 --> 4579.0
they can

4586.12 --> 4590.199
the motivation to say that astronauts

4588.32 --> 4592.719
died in the explosion despite them being

4590.199 --> 4595.0
alive what you think that's any worse

4592.719 --> 4596.159
than telling people that you've landed

4595.0 --> 4599.32
on the

4596.159 --> 4602.839999999999
moon when you know you

4599.32 --> 4604.759999999999
didn't cuz the government told you like

4602.84 --> 4607.4400000000005
yeah we can't actually do that but

4604.76 --> 4609.2390000000005
you're going to have to tell them like

4607.44 --> 4610.919999999999
you did and we're going to have to fake

4609.239 --> 4613.5199999999995
this in the studio because we have to

4610.92 --> 4617.639
win the space race against the Russians

4613.52 --> 4617.639
I mean they did that

4643.639 --> 4648.28
too that's doesn't make sense that they

4645.92 --> 4650.36
created a huge complicated background

4648.28 --> 4654.639
why why wouldn't it make

4650.36 --> 4657.759999999999
sense isn't wouldn't that be the

4654.639 --> 4660.32
point they would make it huge and

4657.76 --> 4662.08
complicated on purpose because then

4660.32 --> 4663.719
people would bump into it and say like

4662.08 --> 4666.32
now that doesn't make any

4663.719 --> 4668.719
sense that's way too big and complicated

4666.32 --> 4671.32
to just make up but that's why they made

4668.719 --> 4674.4800000000005
it big and complicated when they made it

4671.32 --> 4677.679
up so people would bump into it and come

4674.48 --> 4677.678999999999
to that conclusion

4697.679 --> 4701.639
exactly all right anyway I'm going to

4699.56 --> 4703.4400000000005
take a bite of my Illuminati cam but

4701.639 --> 4707.84
yeah keep it coming this is interesting

4703.44 --> 4707.839999999999
I'd like to continue this disc ring

4736.52 --> 4741.76
but keep the names the

4739.719 --> 4745.56
same

4741.76 --> 4752.280000000001
because because that was

4745.56 --> 4752.280000000001
probably a demand from the participants

4780.52 --> 4786.88
or dare I say maybe it was even like

4784.08 --> 4791.88
done on purpose as a challenge to the

4786.88 --> 4791.88
people that would behold it

4795.12 --> 4799.159
that it made it suspicious on

4801.0 --> 4807.96
purpose I mean a lot of what NASA does

4804.56 --> 4809.92
does seem to be like they always on

4807.96 --> 4813.2390000000005
purpose leave loose

4809.92 --> 4813.2390000000005
ends for

4813.28 --> 4818.759999999999
people that are inquisitive to be able

4815.96 --> 4822.6
to find out that they are faking

4818.76 --> 4827.84
it to not hide it too deeply it seems to

4822.6 --> 4827.84
be a thing that they have to do

4883.56 --> 4887.56
h for

4917.04 --> 4920.8
[Music]

4926.36 --> 4931.4
look NASA is an organization that fakes

4931.639 --> 4939.12
space you could see these kinds of weird

4935.679 --> 4945.159
Oddities about keeping the names the

4939.12 --> 4945.159
same leaving errors in visuals Etc

4947.679 --> 4954.88
as their kind of fine

4951.92 --> 4956.6
print that you as a viewer like it's

4954.88 --> 4958.36
like the whole thing is like a contract

4956.6 --> 4959.8
you could even think of it as a contract

4958.36 --> 4962.239
with the

4959.8 --> 4964.56
devil like they're selling you an

4962.239 --> 4967.32
illusion but there has to be a fine

4964.56 --> 4969.280000000001
print telling you like hey this is

4967.32 --> 4972.96
actually a

4969.28 --> 4975.159
lie so that you are forced if you find

4972.96 --> 4977.159
it if you have Sensibility to you and

4975.159 --> 4980.5199999999995
read the whole contract that you will

4977.159 --> 4982.48
know like okay if you sign on to this

4980.52 --> 4984.88
it's your fault because here they they

4982.48 --> 4988.199
tell you that that it's all a

4984.88 --> 4991.639
lie it's toine print in a

4988.199 --> 4994.04
contract contract with the devil that's

4991.639 --> 4997.04
that seems to be the methodology of it

4994.04 --> 4997.04
all

5010.08 --> 5012.32
all

5033.44 --> 5037.36
right for

5083.44 --> 5092.0
do I toast micros

5086.76 --> 5092.0
song I put it in the oven yes

5101.159 --> 5109.32
makes it just a little bit more crispy

5103.159 --> 5109.32
and heats up the uh the vegetable paste

5123.32 --> 5127.28
core for

5174.4 --> 5178.679
hey LSG good to see you

5198.04 --> 5203.119
yeah by the way clutch who's JP what do

5200.8 --> 5205.4800000000005
you who is

5203.119 --> 5209.88
that haven't seen him in a couple of

5205.48 --> 5209.879999999999
days who who is that

5223.639 --> 5226.8
oh jug oh

5231.32 --> 5235.08
right why do you call him

5237.239 --> 5243.678999999999
JV but The Jug did show up

5241.28 --> 5246.119
though did he show up at the beginning

5243.679 --> 5246.119
of the show

5247.239 --> 5253.839999999999
no I I think that he he did say hello

5249.76 --> 5253.84
yesterday at the beginning

5277.84 --> 5283.08
the robot guy from what what does that

5280.44 --> 5286.08
mean what are you talking about

5283.08 --> 5288.84
clutch I mean J was a bit weird though I

5286.08 --> 5293.0
mean he said like I

5288.84 --> 5296.88
never like I don't read or watch fiction

5293.0 --> 5299.48
like wow okay don't know how you managed

5296.88 --> 5301.76
to do that

5299.48 --> 5305.799999999999
but yeah yeah I remember that

5301.76 --> 5310.84
conversation he was a bit like a robot

5305.8 --> 5310.84
almost I get it like that's

5318.4 --> 5325.5599999999995
weird although I have met other people

5322.4 --> 5329.159
like in my past too that like really

5325.56 --> 5334.4800000000005
just they did not like fiction at

5329.159 --> 5334.48
all they would avoid it always

5337.199 --> 5343.08
so it's not completely

5339.76 --> 5343.08
unique what's

5345.0 --> 5348.48
that oh

5348.76 --> 5353.400000000001
yeah

5350.4 --> 5353.4
ah

5356.04 --> 5363.32
that right okay I get it now I

5358.44 --> 5363.32
understand why you call him JP right

5366.88 --> 5371.639
you hate fiction too what burn Smithers

5376.88 --> 5382.04
what the only fiction you like is

5379.56 --> 5386.04
fiction that could be real

5382.04 --> 5386.04
what okay

5418.48 --> 5425.159
you like

5420.84 --> 5425.159000000001
nonfiction okay whatever

5436.119 --> 5441.599999999999
you fell asleep when you first when you

5438.119 --> 5441.599999999999
saw Star Wars oh

5451.76 --> 5456.56
okay I didn't

5455.48 --> 5459.638999999999
but

5456.56 --> 5462.280000000001
it's to be fair for me what like really

5459.639 --> 5466.159000000001
good science fiction movies and series

5462.28 --> 5468.759999999999
what keeps me awake in it you know what

5466.159 --> 5472.239
it is it's the

5468.76 --> 5475.159000000001
music if a series or a movie series has

5472.239 --> 5479.159
franchise whatever if it has the right

5475.159 --> 5481.159
music with a lot of effort like that's

5479.159 --> 5485.92
what keeps me into

5481.159 --> 5485.92
it and Star Wars has great music

5492.6 --> 5498.6
music right so take the great music out

5496.32 --> 5501.799999999999
of a movie like

5498.6 --> 5504.6
that and then yeah then it's all gone

5501.8 --> 5504.6
then it it just

5507.719 --> 5513.6
depletes and I could like I can tell

5510.96 --> 5515.119
like with Star Trek Voyager that I'm

5513.6 --> 5516.4800000000005
watching watching like I'm in the middle

5515.119 --> 5520.639
of

5516.48 --> 5523.08
it there a lot of attention of the

5520.639 --> 5525.719
music a lot of

5523.08 --> 5528.44
detail and the styles are very

5525.719 --> 5530.92
pronounced great

5528.44 --> 5536.5599999999995
Styles

5530.92 --> 5539.36
uh it reminds me a lot of uh Gustav

5536.56 --> 5542.76
Hol which is very likely to have been

5539.36 --> 5545.239
used as an inspiration but hey so it was

5542.76 --> 5549.6
as well for Star Wars I mean that was

5545.239 --> 5552.599999999999
based you can literally pinpoint it like

5549.6 --> 5552.6
which

5553.6 --> 5558.1990000000005
uh what do you call that which

5555.6 --> 5562.320000000001
compositions were used as an inspiration

5558.199 --> 5566.839999999999
and altered for Star Wars is very

5562.32 --> 5568.32
blatant and with yeah with voyager it's

5566.84 --> 5571.28
it's

5568.32 --> 5574.48
really not so pronounced it's just like

5571.28 --> 5576.159
sound effects they just use music

5574.48 --> 5580.799999999999
but keep it really

5576.159 --> 5583.879999999999
simple but have the effects be very

5580.8 --> 5588.84
precise and and so they use Music really

5583.88 --> 5591.32
to give a really precise tone to a situ

5588.84 --> 5593.76
situation and that just works

5591.32 --> 5597.88
fantastically it really does it's the

5593.76 --> 5597.88
music that makes it

5599.48 --> 5607.239
work and so I can predict when it comes

5603.6 --> 5610.8
to fiction especially science

5607.239 --> 5615.599999999999
fiction that involves space and

5610.8 --> 5619.2390000000005
futuristic stuff if the music's not good

5615.6 --> 5620.639
not focused enough not paid enough

5619.239 --> 5623.759999999999
attention to

5620.639 --> 5628.08
it it's not going to work it's the music

5623.76 --> 5628.08
that makes the science fiction work

5642.199 --> 5648.08
wow okay burn Smithers that is just are

5645.76 --> 5652.400000000001
you

5648.08 --> 5655.8
serious life charg your Binks what the

5652.4 --> 5659.879999999999
hell that it sounds to me like you're

5655.8 --> 5659.88
kind of just trolling now

5668.199 --> 5672.799999999999
I mean if you really didn't like it then

5670.679 --> 5677.1990000000005
how the hell did you even get to the

5672.8 --> 5677.1990000000005
point where you're able to identify jar

5682.48 --> 5688.959999999999
Jinks oh you were joking about it oh

5685.199 --> 5688.96
okay fine

5702.32 --> 5709.44
GE was great he brought comic relief no

5706.0 --> 5712.32
he was annoying and distracting but you

5709.44 --> 5715.239
know I watched it back the Star Wars

5712.32 --> 5719.159
prequels and you know

5715.239 --> 5722.32
what if if I'd be really honest he

5719.159 --> 5726.04
wasn't that

5722.32 --> 5729.239
bad yes was annoying but I mean it was

5726.04 --> 5731.08
in line of Star Wars Universe I mean

5729.239 --> 5732.36
Star Wars Universe has annoying

5731.08 --> 5736.159
characters in

5732.36 --> 5740.82
it it seemed to be persistent

5736.159 --> 5743.759999999999
thing I mean c triio is like really

5740.82 --> 5747.4
[Music]

5743.76 --> 5749.8
annoying and Ewoks are just

5747.4 --> 5752.719
like what the

5749.8 --> 5754.84
[Â __Â ] but it seemed to be like no this

5752.719 --> 5757.32
this is how this works

5754.84 --> 5760.6
so to have a georger Binks is really

5757.32 --> 5763.639
like yeah he's annoying but I

5760.6 --> 5766.679
mean he's an annoying character he's not

5763.639 --> 5769.84
like he's annoying by accident no it's

5766.679 --> 5770.92
supposed to be an annoying character in

5769.84 --> 5775.32
in

5770.92 --> 5775.32
this in the movie

5788.4 --> 5794.96
but if you like let go of any like oh I

5792.36 --> 5796.4
hate him when you watch it and you just

5794.96 --> 5799.04
like study it

5796.4 --> 5800.839999999999
honestly yes it's annoying but it's not

5799.04 --> 5803.04
that bad I mean it's been really

5800.84 --> 5809.639
overblown like oh here ruin everything

5803.04 --> 5809.639
it's like no no not not really

5816.92 --> 5823.6
but it it the the one thing

5820.199 --> 5827.28
though that would have probably improved

5823.6 --> 5829.679
upon everything is if somebody like in

5827.28 --> 5831.36
the movie with when Georgia Banks was

5829.679 --> 5833.84
there would actually Express that they

5831.36 --> 5833.839999999999
find him

5834.159 --> 5839.719
annoying cuz nobody says anything like

5837.08 --> 5843.239
they're afraid to be racist or something

5839.719 --> 5846.0
and that is annoying about it that he's

5843.239 --> 5848.04
just annoying and tedious and basically

5846.0 --> 5849.56
in the way and that nobody says anything

5848.04 --> 5853.04
about it and then they all say oh you're

5849.56 --> 5855.400000000001
so brave oh that is annoying not the

5853.04 --> 5857.48
character it's how everybody deals with

5855.4 --> 5860.48
him that's actually the really annoying

5857.48 --> 5860.48
part

5875.719 --> 5879.08
right and and the weird thing is that

5877.28 --> 5882.0
with C

5879.08 --> 5884.4
C3PO it works like he's

5882.0 --> 5885.88
annoying and everybody treats him like

5884.4 --> 5888.28
he's

5885.88 --> 5891.32
annoying and it's kind of funny because

5888.28 --> 5896.719
of that jar your Binks is annoying but

5891.32 --> 5896.719
everybody's basically oh he's so brave

5897.44 --> 5904.5599999999995
and so it is the way that they treat

5901.199 --> 5907.4
them that makes it so tedious is have

5904.56 --> 5907.400000000001
you ever thought of

5908.0 --> 5914.119
that you know and when I actually look

5911.119 --> 5917.44
back at the old Star Wars The

5914.119 --> 5920.36
Originals sometimes now I'm like wow

5917.44 --> 5923.48
they're really mean to

5920.36 --> 5927.119
C3PO they're like screwing around with

5923.48 --> 5930.199
him and it's actually kind of

5927.119 --> 5932.119
mean I mean yes he's an annoying robot

5930.199 --> 5935.44
but he's just trying to do as he's

5932.119 --> 5935.44
programmed to

5943.44 --> 5946.839999999999
all right BN Smither see you

5951.36 --> 5955.839999999999
later that's enough fiction for today

5954.0 --> 5959.639
let's talk about the globe yeah that's

5955.84 --> 5959.639
very funny the globe is the

5961.48 --> 5965.959999999999
fiction oh Jo but good see

5977.88 --> 5984.4800000000005
you a Christmas special oh my

5981.639 --> 5988.2390000000005
God yeah Star Wars Christmas Special was

5984.48 --> 5988.239
just like what the hell is

5991.56 --> 5996.76
that I've seen that one time and that

5994.159 --> 5998.32
thing is kind of

5996.76 --> 6000.1990000000005
painful

5998.32 --> 6003.5599999999995
it it

6000.199 --> 6006.799999999999
really takes you out of

6003.56 --> 6008.4800000000005
the well-installed suspense of disbelief

6006.8 --> 6010.1990000000005
of the movie franchise like the

6008.48 --> 6012.32
Christmas special was really [Â __Â ]

6010.199 --> 6015.32
annoying I

6012.32 --> 6015.32
agree

6022.08 --> 6028.599
yeah and it's it's like the Disco just

6024.679 --> 6031.119
breaks through it that's like

6028.599 --> 6034.4800000000005
terrible like the one good thing about

6031.119 --> 6038.5199999999995
the original Star Wars is that it's

6034.48 --> 6043.08
completely and utterly disco free like

6038.52 --> 6048.76
it doesn't exist it just doesn't exist

6043.08 --> 6048.76
um no disco exists it's like

6049.76 --> 6056.4800000000005
yes right when they had to shove Disco

6053.36 --> 6059.0
crap in everything especially space [Â __Â ]

6056.48 --> 6061.36
like look at bug Rogers it's all disco

6059.0 --> 6061.36
all of

6063.679 --> 6070.4
it and Star Wars is just completely

6066.639 --> 6070.400000000001
disco free and that's just

6072.679 --> 6077.36
awesome but they ruined it with the

6074.92 --> 6077.36
Christmas

6082.239 --> 6086.28
special for

6118.0 --> 6124.119
what Star Trek or Star

6121.119 --> 6126.36
Wars which is better in your opinion

6124.119 --> 6130.719
well they're completely

6126.36 --> 6132.48
different like Star Wars is much

6130.719 --> 6136.119
more

6132.48 --> 6138.799999999999
mythological using space as a

6136.119 --> 6142.28
template well Star Trek is just much

6138.8 --> 6144.96
more technical it's much more futuristic

6142.28 --> 6147.199
and hey it's literally tied it well it

6144.96 --> 6148.96
is futuristic where Star Wars is not

6147.199 --> 6150.44
futuristic because there's no direct

6148.96 --> 6154.28
ties to

6150.44 --> 6157.44
time or Earth One Star Trek it

6154.28 --> 6159.239
specifically is tied into the timeline

6157.44 --> 6162.44
and Earth

6159.239 --> 6165.598999999999
and it's really futuristic Star Wars is

6162.44 --> 6168.239
futuristic Star Trek is I mean Star Trek

6165.599 --> 6172.719
is futuristic Star Wars is not

6168.239 --> 6172.718999999999
futuristic it's more mythological

6176.4 --> 6182.159
which is better there you can't compare

6187.32 --> 6192.48
it as it's as a storytelling device Star

6191.36 --> 6195.679
Wars The

6192.48 --> 6199.199
Originals were really

6195.679 --> 6201.8
good and Star Trek I mean there's no

6199.199 --> 6205.119
story it's just the episode to episode

6201.8 --> 6205.119000000001
thing all of it

6211.639 --> 6218.159000000001
and yes Star Trek is much more viable

6215.56 --> 6218.159000000001
but had

6218.8 --> 6224.0
issues it also Star Trek's like full of

6221.96 --> 6227.159
eugenics placement especially the

6224.0 --> 6230.04
earliest one the original series it's

6227.159 --> 6234.598999999999
full of eugenics

6230.04 --> 6237.04
placement Star Wars is not full of

6234.599 --> 6241.52
eugenics so it's

6237.04 --> 6241.5199999999995
like you just can't really compare

6252.28 --> 6260.159
it but to be fair I mean Star Trek as a

6256.08 --> 6265.04
storytelling medium is much

6260.159 --> 6265.04
more doable better

6265.36 --> 6271.239
there's like stuff that you can learn in

6267.52 --> 6274.4400000000005
Star Trek like lots of it Star Wars you

6271.239 --> 6274.44
don't really learn that

6276.119 --> 6282.119
much it's it's more of a journey of

6279.119 --> 6282.119
feelings

6294.36 --> 6298.48
Star Trek had least more exp yeah of

6296.719 --> 6302.28
course they were very technical and

6298.48 --> 6305.119
futuristic and like a bunch of nerds and

6302.28 --> 6307.32
astrophysicist would think about like oh

6305.119 --> 6308.839999999999
what is it going to what is going to be

6307.32 --> 6310.5599999999995
discovered what is the new energy

6308.84 --> 6314.400000000001
management

6310.56 --> 6317.320000000001
and like very seriously figure out how

6314.4 --> 6320.239
it would virtually develop it's very

6317.32 --> 6322.32
technical and futuristic like that and

6320.239 --> 6325.119
that makes it very interesting there's a

6322.32 --> 6328.759999999999
lot of very interesting

6325.119 --> 6332.44
ideas inserted in Star Trek like

6328.76 --> 6335.04
that I mean yes it's all techno

6332.44 --> 6337.799999999999
Babble and it's basically presupposing

6335.04 --> 6340.32
all these conceptions but I mean they

6337.8 --> 6345.04
really do go with it and they do like

6340.32 --> 6345.04
give it form eloquently

6364.08 --> 6369.44
the love vat in

6366.4 --> 6374.199
space okay that's hilarious

6369.44 --> 6374.199
isg that is freaking hilarious

6389.719 --> 6395.96
Thousand Years time will be whizzing

6391.88 --> 6398.1990000000005
around in the yeah yeah no no you won't

6395.96 --> 6402.599
o I'm

6398.199 --> 6402.598999999999
sorry I'm afraid that's never going to

6403.76 --> 6410.08
happen you might be whizzing around over

6406.56 --> 6414.360000000001
the surface of the Earth but uh no

6410.08 --> 6417.599
there's no infinite distance infinite

6414.36 --> 6417.598999999999
space I'm

6421.84 --> 6426.1990000000005
sorry it will no no it

6432.08 --> 6438.599
won't I want nobody will nobody it

6435.679 --> 6442.719
doesn't exist yeah there may be more

6438.599 --> 6447.56
land out there at the Horizon but not up

6442.719 --> 6447.56
there there I'm sorry it's

6451.04 --> 6458.5199999999995
contained or well yeah there might be

6454.04 --> 6460.28
land directly above us at some point but

6458.52 --> 6464.080000000001
there's

6460.28 --> 6466.4
no like oh let's zoom out and this this

6464.08 --> 6470.36
what we're on is just this little ball

6466.4 --> 6472.4
and there's like billions of stars with

6470.36 --> 6476.679
other planets like I'm afraid that's

6472.4 --> 6476.679
just not real never will

6487.52 --> 6493.8
be here we wi Mark yeah no no I don't

6491.76 --> 6496.8
need to mark your words I know you're

6493.8 --> 6496.8
wrong

6505.04 --> 6511.04
yeah you can come back as many times as

6507.199 --> 6514.199
you like but you'll never experience

6511.04 --> 6517.239
that right you can reincarnate like

6514.199 --> 6519.4
another 20 generations and none of those

6517.239 --> 6522.718999999999
Generations will actually have space

6519.4 --> 6525.879999999999
exploration none of them will so you can

6522.719 --> 6528.04
keep reinvesting your hopes into

6525.88 --> 6529.28
experiencing a life here on Earth but

6528.04 --> 6534.719
you will

6529.28 --> 6534.719
never travel in space

6534.96 --> 6538.84
so you

6536.239 --> 6542.638999999999
shouldn't give your own Spirit false

6538.84 --> 6542.639
promises like that

6568.599 --> 6575.08
yeah yeah know indeed like a tricorder

6571.599 --> 6577.639
definitely and like they do lots of like

6575.08 --> 6581.84
energy field detections I mean that

6577.639 --> 6585.84
stuff is real basically that that has

6581.84 --> 6585.84
been developed

6593.84 --> 6601.1990000000005
it's just in Star Trek the what is

6597.4 --> 6605.36
considered here on Earth the alternative

6601.199 --> 6609.4
technology Tesla related William

6605.36 --> 6614.119
Reich all of it all that

6609.4 --> 6616.48
stuff is standardized in Star Trek with

6614.119 --> 6618.199
devices and perfected and that's just

6616.48 --> 6621.718999999999
how they approach things and that

6618.199 --> 6621.719
actually works

6622.76 --> 6627.0
that's why to me like their technology

6624.92 --> 6628.719
it just feels really natural like the

6627.0 --> 6631.0
only thing that's kind of weird is the

6628.719 --> 6633.56
whole hologram situation where they take

6631.0 --> 6636.32
it with

6633.56 --> 6639.0
because that is it's kind of

6636.32 --> 6641.04
weird like what do you mean you can

6639.0 --> 6644.8
project light that will actually create

6641.04 --> 6648.76
a solid surface that is that is

6644.8 --> 6648.76
freaky that gets a little

6649.599 --> 6656.159000000001
bizarre a little bit hard to uh to are

6652.88 --> 6656.159000000001
really believe

6674.96 --> 6680.44
in I mean as a storytelling medium and

6678.0 --> 6683.44
device like the Hol de is amazing the

6680.44 --> 6686.759999999999
Star Trek is great and they spend a lot

6683.44 --> 6688.4
of time on developing it what you can do

6686.76 --> 6693.639
with it and what can go wrong with it

6688.4 --> 6693.638999999999
etc etc and it is really

6695.32 --> 6700.92
Fantastical I mean I can't imagine a

6698.079 --> 6703.759999999999
single person that's watched Star Trek

6700.92 --> 6706.28
and like got into it that wouldn't that

6703.76 --> 6709.0
wouldn't think like man that would be so

6706.28 --> 6712.44
cool if if we actually had a Hol I mean

6709.0 --> 6712.44
that is amazing

6712.88 --> 6718.159000000001
but it is because it is like a reality

6715.239 --> 6721.5199999999995
emulator on the spot and because of the

6718.159 --> 6725.92
physical qualities if it's all just a

6721.52 --> 6725.92
view it would not be the

6728.48 --> 6733.919999999999
same if it's actually a hologram just

6732.119 --> 6738.239
light yeah then you can't physically

6733.92 --> 6738.2390000000005
interact with it etc etc

6769.04 --> 6774.4
all right anyway going to take a two

6770.28 --> 6774.4
minute break I'll be right back

6801.44 --> 6804.44
that

6831.44 --> 6834.44
e

6861.36 --> 6865.36
e for

6906.32 --> 6909.88
and I'm back

6923.119 --> 6925.44
no

6926.119 --> 6930.5199999999995
LSG you're going to have to take care of

6928.4 --> 6934.36
those robots you can waste your time

6930.52 --> 6934.360000000001
with your friends later

6945.17 --> 6948.229

that 2009 h

7121.88 --> 7127.119
huh wonder if I ever saw that

7148.44 --> 7153.119
I don't recognize it that looks

7150.119 --> 7153.119
interesting

7174.48 --> 7181.638999999999
like that yeah no I think so too and I'm

7177.239 --> 7181.638999999999
definitely going to check it out so

7217.599 --> 7222.76
yeah thanks for the tip I will

7218.88 --> 7222.76
definitely check that out

for

7263.84 --> 7266.079
all

7266.199 --> 7274.119
right Clover Field yeah Clover Field

7270.719 --> 7274.119
is not

7280.639 --> 7284.159000000001
interesting all right right yeah thanks

7282.56 --> 7287.159000000001
for the tip I will definitely check that

7284.159 --> 7287.159
out

7287.79 --> 7290.96
[Music]

7335.52 --> 7341.1990000000005
that's no that's not the Jack Nicholson

7338.199 --> 7341.199
film

7343.28 --> 7348.32
no Oz is not for real Oz is a troll I

7345.76 --> 7351.92
kicked him out earlier like year a year

7348.32 --> 7351.92
ago or something because he is a

7353.639 --> 7362.2390000000005
troll and he's just getting it going

7357.159 --> 7362.239
again he just trolling again

7421.96 --> 7426.84
all right anyway I hope everybody's

7423.32 --> 7426.84
enjoying the show

7457.28 --> 7462.28
I still don't know what I'm going to

7458.559 --> 7462.28
title Today's Show

7469.679 --> 7472.679
in

7488.11 --> 7491.299999999999
[Music]

7496.84 --> 7503.81

7559.3 --> 7562.409000000001
[Music]

7565.8 --> 7571.360000000001
okay I'll make this it's a summary thing

7568.84 --> 7574.400000000001
L

7571.36 --> 7576.719
luran the Challenger act what I'm

7574.4 --> 7577.759999999999
calling it Star Wars mythology for Star

7576.719 --> 7582.599
Trek

7577.76 --> 7584.280000000001
futurism I mean it's sort of

7582.599 --> 7586.360000000001
what we've been talking about could be

7584.28 --> 7590.119
very different though I mean could

7586.36 --> 7595.44
change just into something completely

7590.119 --> 7595.44
different I do think it does summarize

7637.639 --> 7640.639
what

7644.679 --> 7652.0
what the hell are you talking

7647.44 --> 7652.0
about what do you mean prawns

7654.0 --> 7658.36
what hello clear

7687.079 --> 7692.32
oh okay thanks at Le I didn't know that

7695.21 --> 7698.359
[Music]

7727.76 --> 7733.159000000001
oh well clearly the mother ship just

7730.239 --> 7737.959999999999
went in a Geo stationary

7733.159 --> 7737.96
orbit that's what they call it

7752.84 --> 7756.189
[Music]

7783.159 --> 7790.0
oh that was

7784.84 --> 7790.0
fast downloads already done

7790.32 --> 7794.36
man for

7847.4 --> 7853.558999999999
oh wow the weather's still looking the

7850.639 --> 7853.559
same look got

7880.239 --> 7884.28
this for

7905.61 --> 7908.799999999999
[Music]

7918.079 --> 7922.0
okay flut s you're going to have to

7919.8 --> 7924.88
explain that to me why wouldn't it

7922.0 --> 7926.96
maintain an ecliptical orbit if the ship

7924.88 --> 7929.92
is anti-gravity what what does that even

7926.96 --> 7929.92
mean what what is

7939.199 --> 7943.678999999999
anti-gravity does anti-gravity mean it

7942.079 --> 7946.96
pushes

7943.679 --> 7951.92
in it negates the

7946.96 --> 7955.52
gravity or it counter it in yeah inserts

7951.92 --> 7958.2390000000005
a force to counter gravitation like what

7955.52 --> 7961.84
does anti-gravity even mean you

7958.239 --> 7961.839999999999
know hey borders

7962.4 --> 7968.5199999999995
boy you're late again okay that's that's

7965.52 --> 7968.52
fine

7989.679 --> 7993.1990000000005
good show watching yeah you're just

7991.44 --> 7996.719
gonna have to figure it

7993.199 --> 7998.879999999999
out B boy I mean I think I've had a fun

7996.719 --> 8001.76
time I mean it's been I haven't been

7998.88 --> 8004.2390000000005
like intensely inspired or anything like

8001.76 --> 8007.4800000000005
yesterday when nobody showed

8004.239 --> 8010.48
up but I mean it's been a fun show I

8007.48 --> 8010.48
think

8045.079 --> 8050.5199999999995
I don't get it flatters how is it

8046.719 --> 8050.52
supposed to be an elliptical

8051.04 --> 8057.28
orbit does that mean that the ship just

8053.88 --> 8059.559
goes up and down up and down is that the

8057.28 --> 8062.679
idea like

8059.559 --> 8066.679
what maybe I watch the movie before I

8062.679 --> 8066.679
like ask more questions about

8090.04 --> 8093.04
it

8119.96 --> 8122.96
for

8149.92 --> 8152.92
for

8179.92 --> 8183.88
for for

8215.319 --> 8219.039999999999
walk completed

8221.16 --> 8228.8
okay thanks for the update heal Luna

8224.8 --> 8228.8
Bar right

8249.639 --> 8254.639
yeah no I get it FL stage but I mean

8251.96 --> 8258.759999999998
everybody thinks of it just

8254.639 --> 8262.839999999998
like like a magnet right like how you

8258.76 --> 8264.960000000001
can keep a magnet yeah repelling another

8262.84 --> 8267.960000000001
magnet and then just like keep it at a

8264.96 --> 8267.96
distance

8278.639 --> 8284.24
that's how people at least imagine how

8281.84 --> 8284.24
that would

8289.12 --> 8295.0
work heliocentric [Â __Â ] yeah of

8292.639 --> 8299.518999999998
course I mean it's based on technology

8295.0 --> 8301.679
and never act it never does actually

8299.519 --> 8306.519
apply right

8301.679 --> 8306.519
because gravity is just a gigantic

8306.639 --> 8312.399
mess and helos centes and everything

8309.28 --> 8312.399000000001
about it is just a

8329.719 --> 8333.759999999998
mess e

8365.12 --> 8369.359
it just works by

8367.12 --> 8373.439
magnetism yeah but the problem is is

8369.359 --> 8376.84
that magnetism doesn't attract nonfic

8373.439 --> 8378.76
Metals basically so that's wouldn't work

8376.84 --> 8382.319
it's something that has to be able to

8378.76 --> 8382.319
attract everything

8419.64 --> 8423.68
all for

8450.76 --> 8453.76
h

8489.479 --> 8495.92
gas is not affected by

8491.68 --> 8499.76
magnetism well to be fair

8495.92 --> 8502.399
oxygen I don't know like oxygen is like

8499.76 --> 8503.399
magnetic that really becomes apparent

8502.399 --> 8507.08
when

8503.399 --> 8507.08
it it become

8507.72 --> 8512.96
solid

8509.319 --> 8512.96
but I I don't

8513.8 --> 8521.72
know if you could actually

8517.56 --> 8524.88
attract oxygen gas with a powerful

8521.72 --> 8527.76
enough electromagnet for

8524.88 --> 8530.358999999999
example I don't know if it has any kind

8527.76 --> 8533.64
of yeah if it does

8530.359 --> 8535.960000000001
not influence gases whatsoever I don't

8533.64 --> 8539.96
know if it

8535.96 --> 8539.96
does h

8562.64 --> 8570.92
like maybe it does influence gases

8566.84 --> 8573.92
somewhat but just not enough to to hold

8570.92 --> 8575.56
it into a specific like not enough to

8573.92 --> 8578.6
bind it perhaps I don't know I don't

8575.56 --> 8583.64
know if magnetism has absolutely no

8578.6 --> 8583.640000000001
influence on gases I'm not sure

8603.6 --> 8607.399000000001
I don't know health lunabar I don't

8605.08 --> 8608.92
think that debatable D is coming back I

8607.399 --> 8611.68
I don't I don't even know if that

8608.92 --> 8611.68
account still

8614.24 --> 8619.359
exists I mean I banned de bable D the

8616.96 --> 8622.358999999999
other day then when I wanted to unban

8619.359 --> 8624.52
them the account was gone so I haven't

8622.359 --> 8627.08
seen debatable D

8624.52 --> 8629.76
since that was this whole thing about

8627.08 --> 8632.8
claiming that she was a girl and all

8629.76 --> 8636.12
that and I did didn't buy it

8632.8 --> 8636.119999999999
that was

8642.8 --> 8648.56
weird yeah I did check it out on my Pand

8645.52 --> 8651.76
list and she wasn't

8648.56 --> 8655.6
there and I did spell the name correctly

8651.76 --> 8655.6
don't worry about that

8670.04 --> 8673.0
but to me it looked

8673.76 --> 8678.439
like like she just deleted the

8688.88 --> 8694.358999999999
account de with was a girl yeah I didn't

8692.08 --> 8696.96
get that either I mean I didn't think of

8694.359 --> 8699.319
her as a girl for a while

8696.96 --> 8701.199999999999
and just kind of thought he was kind of

8699.319 --> 8705.08
a gay guy or

8701.2 --> 8712.279
something and so maybe like I don't

8705.08 --> 8712.279
know just didn't connect right in ways

8729.25 --> 8732.379
[Music]

8736.439 --> 8741.2
saw debatable D really when was

8741.479 --> 8745.278999999999
that could have sworn debatable D was a

8744.08 --> 8750.12
guy

8745.279 --> 8750.12
yeah that's what I thought too

8763.56 --> 8768.119999999999
hey oh you're right debatable D is in

8775.0 --> 8780.64
there okay well she's still around then

8794.319 --> 8799.92
yeah well flatter said yeah I don't know

8797.68 --> 8802.92
I just don't really know it was just

8799.92 --> 8802.92
annoying

8810.439 --> 8816.319
is she coming back I don't

8813.2 --> 8819.04
know why don't you go over to Fed live

8816.319 --> 8823.76
chat and ask her she's in

8819.04 --> 8828.84
there I'm not going to going to do

8823.76 --> 8828.84
that but uh yeah I don't know

8860.14 --> 8863.199999999999
[Music]

8869.72 --> 8875.08
nope but yeah she's not in my band list

8872.359 --> 8880.359
or here or

8875.08 --> 8880.359
whatever in the oh God please

8926.76 --> 8931.399
all right but I mean it could be the

8928.52 --> 8933.880000000001
debatable to as indeed like a woman but

8931.399 --> 8936.16
then even as a woman like just got on my

8933.88 --> 8939.319
nerves at

8936.16 --> 8943.279
times like would come in here and just

8939.319 --> 8943.278999999999
start whining I mean that's

8945.319 --> 8949.88
terrible that's a terrible way to enter

8947.72 --> 8949.88
my

8957.56 --> 8964.519999999999
chat the is a woman allegedly I don't

8961.439 --> 8966.64
know that's what she

8964.52 --> 8971.2
said but I

8966.64 --> 8971.199999999999
mean we don't know

9011.72 --> 9018.96
do know for and and how how do you know

9015.08 --> 9022.96
that Oz how do you know that for a

9018.96 --> 9022.96
fact for

9055.319 --> 9060.84
oh you've been talking oh that's the way

9057.64 --> 9060.84
you know it oh

9072.68 --> 9076.68
okay right

9098.56 --> 9105.039999999999
yeah flatter Sage that was suspicious I

9101.92 --> 9108.16
mean I never really thought of the bable

9105.04 --> 9111.29
D as a woman although I think that she

9108.16 --> 9112.64
did actually mention something like that

9111.29 --> 9115.92
[Music]

9112.64 --> 9118.519999999999
before and it could be why there's like

9115.92 --> 9121.72
no response to being called

9118.52 --> 9123.6
gay cuz it just doesn't make any logical

9121.72 --> 9127.519999999999
sense to you if you're a woman when

9123.6 --> 9127.52
you're called that for that kind of

9128.24 --> 9134.6
behavior cuz it wasn't like the first

9130.52 --> 9137.560000000001
time I was calling him her

9134.6 --> 9140.279
gay she would have like these kinds of

9137.56 --> 9144.16
remarks after like

9140.279 --> 9144.16
like but is it gay when you're a

9144.64 --> 9149.76
woman but yeah I basically told her like

9148.04 --> 9153.399000000001
I'm not going to give you female

9149.76 --> 9155.6
privilege as long as you're not like

9153.399 --> 9157.64
identified as long as you don't have

9155.6 --> 9162.439
like give actual proof you're a woman

9157.64 --> 9162.439
like by coming on camera or something

9175.439 --> 9181.319
she told me what I don't know what

9177.479 --> 9181.319
you're talking about no

9213.2 --> 9218.76
oh god let's hope not flatter Sage that

9215.68 --> 9218.76
would I don't think

9225.6 --> 9232.319
so I think that if she was trans that it

9229.359 --> 9235.399000000001
would be a lot more

9232.319 --> 9236.519999999999
triggered for either being called a man

9235.399 --> 9240.0
or a

9236.52 --> 9242.24
woman or gay or whatever so I don't

9240.0 --> 9242.24
think

9246.279 --> 9254.08
so should be res referenced to as it

9250.479 --> 9254.08
until resolves

9258.08 --> 9262.72
okay I don't know about about that B's

9282.479 --> 9288.599999999999
boy oh what saw big black bear okay cool

9288.64 --> 9291.64
clutch

9318.64 --> 9322.68
e e

9357.8 --> 9360.8
now

9406.72 --> 9410.399
okay whatever you say help Luna Bar

9408.52 --> 9413.08
Maybe

9410.399 --> 9417.08
I don't know I'm not counting on it I

9413.08 --> 9420.72
mean since that one time I kicked

9417.08 --> 9422.56
B he or she whatever it is wasn't bad

9420.72 --> 9427.84
hasn't been back since

9422.56 --> 9427.84
so but at least he's still out

9428.439 --> 9433.16
there I don't know maybe I just offended

9431.279 --> 9435.92
her too much or

9433.16 --> 9438.56
something so other people that keep

9435.92 --> 9440.56
mentioning it too like price of Adam out

9438.56 --> 9443.24
there

9440.56 --> 9445.359
apparently he joined when I was in a bad

9443.24 --> 9448.199999999999
mood and I said like don't piss me off

9445.359 --> 9451.6
and that was apparently enough for him

9448.2 --> 9453.08
to not want to come back anymore so yeah

9451.6 --> 9455.279
I don't know what to do about that kind

9453.08 --> 9455.279
of

9456.08 --> 9464.319
thing except for try to not have a bad

9460.76 --> 9467.76
mood or if I do then try to not express

9464.319 --> 9467.76
it as much

9496.88 --> 9503.119999999999
what the what is r d r R2 what is

9521.68 --> 9527.12
that it's bad ass what

9544.68 --> 9551.880000000001
oh Red Dead Redemption of

9548.88 --> 9551.88
goody

9558.359 --> 9561.359
right

9565.95 --> 9568.999000000002
[Music]

9588.319 --> 9592.359
for e

9625.64 --> 9632.76
right anyway hope everybody's enjoying

9627.479 --> 9632.76
the show I'm not super talkative but

9634.84 --> 9640.880000000001
uh yeah can't have that kind of energy

9638.08 --> 9642.479
like I did yesterday every day I did say

9640.88 --> 9645.519999999999
that it was probably going to be

9642.479 --> 9645.519999999999
depleted today a

9645.92 --> 9653.6
bit but yeah the chat's going nicely and

9650.8 --> 9653.599999999999
just tagging

9676.52 --> 9682.279
along

9678.24 --> 9682.279
h for

9738.16 --> 9742.16
h for

9780.72 --> 9785.0
oh you have night vision goggles clutch

9782.64 --> 9785.0
that is

9786.16 --> 9789.16
cool

9798.12 --> 9801.12
h

9828.04 --> 9832.080000000002
for for

9833.93 --> 9837.159
[Music]

9888.6 --> 9891.04
m

9892.06 --> 9895.16
[Music]

9899.39 --> 9903.4
[Music]

9917.96 --> 9921.96
yeah for

9957.0 --> 9960.52
okay what's that link

9963.16 --> 9968.08
C land speed record

9969.04 --> 9974.359
what what another land speed record

9982.08 --> 9987.439
yeah it's just a horizontal

9984.439 --> 9987.439
rocket

9997.8 --> 10001.8
basically h

10021.52 --> 10023.960000000001
that looks

10035.16 --> 10040.319
intense what

10037.24 --> 10044.64
763 mil an hour

10040.319 --> 10044.64
damn that's crazy

10087.479 --> 10090.64
wait that's

10088.76 --> 10093.08
like

10090.64 --> 10097.68
63 6

10093.08 --> 10097.68
767 mil hour

10099.72 --> 10105.96
is like the sound barrier so that's like

10103.12 --> 10109.12
just a fraction under the sound barrier

10105.96 --> 10111.8
so basically that thing went as quick as

10109.12 --> 10111.800000000001
the speed of

10114.8 --> 10122.88
sound

10117.72 --> 10122.88
huh yeah 763 mil

10126.399 --> 10132.0
hour a damn it that's too where

10152.8 --> 10155.84
[Music]

10187.64 --> 10191.68
hm for

10225.88 --> 10230.679999999998
miles 6 minutes yeah it's fast that's

10228.439 --> 10230.68
for

10237.399 --> 10240.96
certain the Challenger being launched

10239.88 --> 10242.92
but

10240.96 --> 10246.199999999999
horizontally yeah you can think of it

10242.92 --> 10246.2
like that

10252.52 --> 10259.800000000001
but I mean these kinds of projects these

10257.04 --> 10263.6
super fast cars like they do actually

10259.8 --> 10266.56
blow up and [Â __Â ] too

10263.6 --> 10271.16
so it's like just one tiny little thing

10266.56 --> 10271.16
goes wrong and it just goes kaboom

10287.12 --> 10291.160000000002
but yeah it is indeed proof that the

10289.2 --> 10292.800000000001
Earth is flat because if there was just

10291.16 --> 10297.84
a tiny bit

10292.8 --> 10301.8
of bumpiness or a curve to it like the

10297.84 --> 10301.8
vehicle would never be able to keep

10305.04 --> 10310.479000000001
stable it has to be perfectly flat

10316.2 --> 10321.279
all right anyway take a two-minute break

10318.6 --> 10321.279
I'll be right

10337.52 --> 10340.52
back

10367.439 --> 10370.439
e

10397.439 --> 10400.439
for

10427.439 --> 10431.359
for e

10477.74 --> 10482.239
[Music]

10479.8 --> 10482.239
and I'm

10482.56 --> 10491.199999999999
back length of 2.9 Million what this is

10488.04 --> 10491.2
getting really silly

10500.92 --> 10507.56
here qu mile second yeah it is crazy

10517.319 --> 10521.278999999999
fast for

10556.52 --> 10565.16
oh wait no sorry at the end of the video

10561.239 --> 10570.039999999999
it says they're hoping to smash the

10565.16 --> 10571.96
current land speed record of 763 M hour

10570.04 --> 10574.960000000001
doesn't say they have actually done it

10571.96 --> 10574.96
yet

10578.6 --> 10586.16
so that like the speed record is

10581.68 --> 10586.16
directly underneath the speed of sound

10586.359 --> 10591.2
basically but yeah I mean if they want

10588.92 --> 10594.52
to break it like are they intending to

10591.2 --> 10597.960000000001
be capable of breaking the sound barrier

10594.52 --> 10600.08
and without blowing up the

10597.96 --> 10603.0
vehicle that's pretty much going to be

10600.08 --> 10603.0
the challenge I'd

10607.239 --> 10610.239
say

10637.16 --> 10641.16
for for

10673.2 --> 10678.0
just trying to keep it on the

10675.0 --> 10678.0
ground

10678.76 --> 10685.52
right well yeah if they did the same

10681.479 --> 10689.64
thing but on a rail system like using a

10685.52 --> 10691.800000000001
magl type setup it would be much easier

10689.64 --> 10696.08
to

10691.8 --> 10698.88
achieve speeds beyond the sound barrier

10696.08 --> 10701.52
because like yeah you're not going to

10698.88 --> 10703.16
have the Sound Shock Wave basically

10701.52 --> 10706.279
vibrate you off the

10703.16 --> 10709.119999999999
ground cuz you're stuck magnetically

10706.279 --> 10712.479000000001
magnetically locked and like that's not

10709.12 --> 10715.92
going to have an influence on

10712.479 --> 10718.358999999999
that I don't know if that's if it has to

10715.92 --> 10721.399
be like with

10718.359 --> 10725.56
wheels or whether land speed record

10721.399 --> 10728.68
would include rail system based because

10725.56 --> 10731.278999999999
I mean if I'd want to break

10728.68 --> 10733.92
land speed I would use a MAG left like

10731.279 --> 10737.399000000001
rail system and just like see if I could

10733.92 --> 10737.399
go Way Beyond the sound

10739.439 --> 10746.6
barrier it would basically be just a

10743.52 --> 10751.6
giant missile rocket stuck

10746.6 --> 10751.6
to to a magala rail

10761.72 --> 10767.278999999999
wonder how long it takes to get up to

10763.8 --> 10767.278999999999
full speed

10768.12 --> 10774.720000000001
well not too fast I mean it can't

10772.16 --> 10779.64
accelerate too heavily because then it

10774.72 --> 10779.64
will literally crush the uh the

10780.279 --> 10784.359
pilot

10782.08 --> 10787.12
right which would be the same kind of

10784.359 --> 10789.56
problem if you're like you can't have a

10787.12 --> 10792.319000000001
pilot with it on an actual missile

10789.56 --> 10794.278999999999
because like the the way the amount it

10792.319 --> 10796.8
would accelerate would just immediately

10794.279 --> 10801.359
crush the

10796.8 --> 10801.358999999999
pilot so it has to get up to

10801.8 --> 10806.72
speed

10803.64 --> 10810.319
gradually and then just manage a really

10806.72 --> 10810.319
high top speed

10836.88 --> 10842.358999999999
H wow we're already done for three hours

10840.76 --> 10843.76
hope everybody's enjoying the show if

10842.359 --> 10848.68
you are then please don't forget to

10843.76 --> 10848.68
Rogan it up and share it

10851.76 --> 10856.56
currently talking about land speed

10853.72 --> 10856.56
records for some

10861.399 --> 10867.358999999999
reason so the video that clearly posted

10864.359 --> 10867.359
earlier

10895.6 --> 10900.319
right and by the way to just feed it

10897.439 --> 10903.439
back to the original the Challenger act

10900.319 --> 10908.399
and all that I mean none of these

10903.439 --> 10912.479000000001
Rockets including the Apollo Rocket like

10908.399 --> 10914.599999999999
those Rockets were so insanely

10912.479 --> 10918.119999999999
loud

10914.6 --> 10921.800000000001
that like the astronauts couldn't have

10918.12 --> 10921.800000000001
been in the space

10922.0 --> 10927.2
shuttle that was stuck to that rocket

10924.52 --> 10931.84
because the sound of it would literally

10927.2 --> 10935.84
have just killed them was so insanely

10931.84 --> 10938.08
loud you need to be like in a bunker if

10935.84 --> 10941.8
you're close to that or you would

10938.08 --> 10945.359
literally die from the intense

10941.8 --> 10947.599999999999
vibration of the rocket launch sound it

10945.359 --> 10949.0
was so insanely loud the astronauts

10947.6 --> 10952.439
could have never survived that and

10949.0 --> 10953.6
that's like an ongoing issue with all

10952.439 --> 10956.720000000001
those rocket

10953.6 --> 10961.479000000001
launches and so much so that there was

10956.72 --> 10964.599999999999
even this weird little video about how

10961.479 --> 10969.84
there was like an escape tunnel for the

10964.6 --> 10969.84
people getting into the supposed

10970.08 --> 10979.319
cockpits so they could get like in a

10974.439 --> 10982.6
bunker like room underneath it all on

10979.319 --> 10987.56
the side that made them immune to the

10982.6 --> 10987.56
insanely loud sound of the

10988.08 --> 10994.0
rockets and there's this video about

10991.279 --> 10996.479000000001
that cuz but that stands that's with all

10994.0 --> 10998.319
of them like nobody was in any of those

10996.479 --> 11001.358999999999
Rockets because they'd all be

10998.319 --> 11005.278999999999
dead they'd be dead like just a couple

11001.359 --> 11005.279
of seconds after the launch

11005.88 --> 11011.92
starts all of it cuz it's too loud

11008.84 --> 11011.92
everything would be

11012.56 --> 11019.92
killed they couldn't like isolate the

11016.76 --> 11024.479
cockpits from The Sound

11019.92 --> 11024.479
enough to make it feasible

11033.56 --> 11038.439
particular land speed record has to be

11035.84 --> 11040.2
four wheeled car okay fair enough so

11038.439 --> 11043.52
yeah rail systems not

11040.2 --> 11047.08
included is there a rail speed record by

11043.52 --> 11047.08
the way in that sense as

11056.72 --> 11061.599999999999
well you've got to wonder like how fast

11059.96 --> 11064.8
would you be able to

11061.6 --> 11069.0
go with the me left type

11064.8 --> 11071.84
setup could you like go like thousand

11069.0 --> 11075.08
like over a thousand miles an

11071.84 --> 11075.08
hour that

11075.6 --> 11081.76
way I mean you could theoretically even

11079.479 --> 11085.479
outo

11081.76 --> 11088.880000000001
flight that way just be faster than

11085.479 --> 11088.88
normal flight

11091.2 --> 11098.0
the only issue is that well those real

11093.6 --> 11098.0
tracks would have to be pretty damn

11105.92 --> 11111.04
straight and it could also be kind of

11108.359 --> 11115.92
dangerous potentially I could imagine if

11111.04 --> 11119.640000000001
you try to go that fast through a storm

11115.92 --> 11119.64
situation so

11126.359 --> 11129.880000000001
oh man it's getting kind of cold in

11142.2 --> 11150.6
here the Air Force used to go pretty

11145.84 --> 11150.6
fast on Rails what does that mean e

11185.319 --> 11193.519999999999
whoa Jesus that is

11188.16 --> 11197.96
insane okay that is very

11193.52 --> 11197.960000000001
fast holy [Â __Â ]

11216.84 --> 11219.399
yeah that's

11234.8 --> 11239.519999999999
insane was somebody actually riding

11239.72 --> 11246.519999999999
that that

11242.359 --> 11246.52
seems it l like that's not

11247.0 --> 11253.439
doable seriously what like in that real

11250.56 --> 11259.64
based super speed

11253.439 --> 11259.64
thing is there actually somebody in that

11262.84 --> 11270.68
thing they were magnetic tracks they'd

11266.0 --> 11270.68
go even faster a

11305.72 --> 11310.84
yeah but

11307.08 --> 11312.479
clear the gravity keeps it in locked

11310.84 --> 11315.2
step

11312.479 --> 11317.96
gravity going to the center of a ball

11315.2 --> 11320.76
corrects for the I don't know

11317.96 --> 11323.319
centripetal forces or

11320.76 --> 11326.960000000001
something just don't think about it too

11323.319 --> 11331.519999999999
hard it could just go perfectly straight

11326.96 --> 11331.519999999999
very fast fast and it's no

11337.279 --> 11342.479000000001
problem but yeah when you really think

11339.68 --> 11345.479000000001
about it I

11342.479 --> 11348.92
mean if something goes in a straight

11345.479 --> 11353.239
line it's going to want to stay you on a

11348.92 --> 11355.16
straight line ukian wise so if something

11353.239 --> 11357.92
on a

11355.16 --> 11360.76
sphere moves fast enough it is

11357.92 --> 11362.88
eventually going to then naturally

11360.76 --> 11365.72
detach

11362.88 --> 11367.119999999999
itself from the spherical surface

11365.72 --> 11369.0
because it wants to go in a straight

11367.12 --> 11371.6
line if it goes fast enough it like it

11369.0 --> 11375.12
will go in a straight line and does

11371.6 --> 11375.12
detach itself from the

11375.64 --> 11383.8
surface but it's never doing

11378.68 --> 11383.800000000001
that because the Earth is flat

11446.239 --> 11450.279
okay for

11492.96 --> 11496.519999999999
need my fresh air but I mean it is

11494.76 --> 11500.04
getting kind of cold out

11496.52 --> 11500.04
there makes me

11504.0 --> 11509.239
like yeah Hypersonic sled is insane yeah

11544.16 --> 11549.039999999999
the trains yeah FL that's some weird

11547.279 --> 11550.560000000001
[Â __Â ] right I mean that you're talking

11549.04 --> 11554.2
about Japan

11550.56 --> 11556.6
now where they have special Railway

11554.2 --> 11558.6
assistants that just literally have to

11556.6 --> 11561.279
push all the people in the train so that

11558.6 --> 11561.279
the doors can

11563.16 --> 11570.16
close yeah that's

11566.12 --> 11570.160000000002
nuts e

11578.88 --> 11582.0
[Music]

11613.6 --> 11618.960000000001
Hypersonic sled sounds fun I don't know

11617.04 --> 11622.2
man when it's that fast it's just kind

11618.96 --> 11622.199999999999
of scary

11638.16 --> 11644.0
I mean I'd not I would absolutely not be

11641.72 --> 11646.599999999999
eager to get in that

11644.0 --> 11650.8
thing you would have to

11646.6 --> 11655.800000000001
like really pay me a lot to even like

11650.8 --> 11655.8
consider actually trying that out

11658.2 --> 11661.960000000001
as long as you don't die here

11667.2 --> 11672.08
right but I mean like the forces you're

11669.72 --> 11674.8
going to be your body is going to be

11672.08 --> 11677.0
enduring just going that fast I mean

11674.8 --> 11681.0
it's going to

11677.0 --> 11681.0
be quite surreal

11686.04 --> 11690.0
probably for

11737.64 --> 11742.08
yeah well the difference FL stage is

11739.88 --> 11742.96
with roller coasters you might black out

11742.08 --> 11745.64
because

11742.96 --> 11748.56
of the centripetal forces that you're

11745.64 --> 11752.64
going to be subjected to

11748.56 --> 11754.198999999999
this uh that Hypersonic sled does not

11752.64 --> 11755.96
have any because it's going in a

11754.199 --> 11759.6
straight

11755.96 --> 11759.599999999999
line so it is

11762.88 --> 11766.64
different right but instead of like

11765.399 --> 11770.519999999999
getting

11766.64 --> 11772.64
like your blood being impromptu

11770.52 --> 11775.319000000001
redistributed in a way in your body

11772.64 --> 11777.119999999999
that's like not optimal to remain retain

11775.319 --> 11780.359
your consciousness

11777.12 --> 11782.720000000001
like in Hypersonic sled it's going to be

11780.359 --> 11785.08
just like this strain of just

11782.72 --> 11786.96
accelerating that fast it's just like

11785.08 --> 11789.8
you're going to like feel it go through

11786.96 --> 11795.56
your body like like this is just too

11789.8 --> 11795.56
[Â __Â ] fast going to feel like literal

11796.279 --> 11802.279
strain like going through you like

11799.8 --> 11804.679999999998
trying to break you

11802.279 --> 11808.08
apart so it's a completely different

11804.68 --> 11808.08
type of sensation

11811.96 --> 11818.679999999998
liquefy the body well if it doesn't like

11816.0 --> 11821.12
take its proper time to accelerate if

11818.68 --> 11823.04
it's just instant acceleration yeah then

11821.12 --> 11825.359
you would definitely like just get

11823.04 --> 11828.52
crushed to a

11825.359 --> 11832.16
pulp if you have a proper buildup time

11828.52 --> 11835.16
to actually get to that speed then it's

11832.16 --> 11835.16
different

11838.72 --> 11845.84
but were was the Hypersonic sled of that

11842.08 --> 11845.84
video was that actually

11847.479 --> 11856.72
manned or is it just a robot just a

11853.16 --> 11860.16
device cuz then it's probably more for

11856.72 --> 11863.319
things like missile testing and all that

11860.16 --> 11865.319
cuz missiles with bombs can literally

11863.319 --> 11868.6
accelerate at any

11865.319 --> 11872.039999999999
Pace cuz there has there be no pilot in

11868.6 --> 11874.319
it it's the pilot that's going to slow

11872.04 --> 11877.0
down how fast something can accelerate

11874.319 --> 11877.0
or go through a

11878.399 --> 11884.439
corner because they have to be able to

11880.76 --> 11884.439
endure the force of that

11889.6 --> 11898.6
acceleration light speed yeah whatever

11893.56 --> 11898.6
clear light speed is just a concept

11920.239 --> 11925.119999999999
sure you would could write that sled

11922.68 --> 11927.239
safely well that's my

11925.12 --> 11930.439
question like is it

11927.239 --> 11935.279
designed to have a human occupant or is

11930.439 --> 11937.64
it just like to design missile engines

11935.279 --> 11941.0
because then it wouldn't have to have

11937.64 --> 11941.0
human occupants

11964.84 --> 11969.84
I mean that's the whole question right

11966.64 --> 11975.08
what's the objective of that Hypersonic

11969.84 --> 11979.359
rail thing is it to test how the power

11975.08 --> 11983.12
of of a rocket engine or is it to test

11979.359 --> 11983.12
like structural integrity and

11984.279 --> 11990.439
for for a piloted vehicle

12032.52 --> 12035.720000000001
H all

12043.12 --> 12048.479000000001
right man can't believe we're almost

12046.68 --> 12051.199
moving into June

12048.479 --> 12053.438999999998
already I really hope June's going to be

12051.199 --> 12056.08
a little bit more sunny I mean I'm done

12053.439 --> 12060.6
with this freaking rain [Â __Â ] I mean

12056.08 --> 12063.88
bring out the sun man just actually

12060.6 --> 12066.52
thick yeah hot sun like I want to be in

12063.88 --> 12069.278999999999
the shirt and complaining about the heat

12066.52 --> 12071.479000000001
again I'm done with this stupid rain all

12069.279 --> 12071.479000000001
the

12072.68 --> 12079.199
time I mean yeah that beautiful cloud

12076.8 --> 12082.119999999999
skies and all that at

12079.199 --> 12085.319000000001
times I've been able to show you some

12082.12 --> 12087.84
good sites but I mean I want some proper

12085.319 --> 12087.84
summer

12088.08 --> 12095.319
heat he'll

12091.16 --> 12095.319
trade the Sun for some

12095.52 --> 12100.239
rain I'd love to send the rain over at

12098.279 --> 12104.359
your

12100.239 --> 12107.16
place and get some like Crystal Clear

12104.359 --> 12109.56
Blue Skies with full sun I love to have

12107.16 --> 12109.56
some of

12123.04 --> 12129.6
that what I think it was to see if

12125.96 --> 12129.599999999999
horizontal is actually

12131.199 --> 12135.76
horizontal now I think that Engineers

12133.64 --> 12137.479
that busy themselves with designs like

12135.76 --> 12140.239
that I don't think think that they're

12137.479 --> 12144.039999999999
like in need of

12140.239 --> 12145.96
testing whether the Earth is flat or

12144.04 --> 12150.880000000001
curved at the

12145.96 --> 12155.278999999999
surface and I think they're already like

12150.88 --> 12155.278999999999
done figuring that out at that

12155.64 --> 12160.239
point I mean the Earth is definitely

12163.199 --> 12168.6
flat if you do enough engineering you'll

12166.08 --> 12173.6
find out that it has to be

12168.6 --> 12178.12
flat Earth is flat because it has to

12173.6 --> 12181.960000000001
be it just does nothing works if it's

12178.12 --> 12186.319000000001
curved nothing makes sense if it

12181.96 --> 12186.319
curved nothing that is claimed to

12186.359 --> 12190.12
be makes any

12194.16 --> 12199.76
sense if it's a bow but it's flat so

12198.04 --> 12201.479000000001
then it does make sense everything makes

12199.76 --> 12203.319
sense if the Earth is flat nothing makes

12201.479 --> 12207.56
sense if the Earth is a

12203.319 --> 12210.479
ball only are preconceived notions

12207.56 --> 12213.198999999999
of yeah physically assumption bias based

12210.479 --> 12216.399
Notions of what the lights in the sky

12213.199 --> 12219.560000000001
are in our imagination that that's the

12216.399 --> 12219.56
only part that makes

12221.279 --> 12226.800000000001
sense if the Earth was a ball which it

12223.8 --> 12226.8
isn't

12247.04 --> 12255.68
what park that you usually go to smoke

12252.319 --> 12257.239
at gets filled up so it basically looks

12255.68 --> 12261.76
like a lake

12257.239 --> 12261.76
like a Mirror Lake right perfectly flat

12264.359 --> 12269.439
reflection if don't forget about that I

12266.88 --> 12272.08
mean if the Earth was a sphere then if

12269.439 --> 12275.0
you look out over the ocean or a

12272.08 --> 12279.279
lake you're not you're going to look at

12275.0 --> 12283.08
a reflection of a spherical surface and

12279.279 --> 12285.960000000001
not a perfect mirror copy of what is

12283.08 --> 12288.319
above which is what you get to see over

12285.96 --> 12288.319
still

12288.479 --> 12296.239
water you don't get a spherical

12291.64 --> 12297.439
Distortion a bent version of of what's

12296.239 --> 12300.279
above

12297.439 --> 12302.16
it you get a perfect Mirror Image

12300.279 --> 12304.640000000001
reflection of what is above it that's

12302.16 --> 12307.08
what you get to see over Still Water

12304.64 --> 12309.198999999999
large bodies is still water because the

12307.08 --> 12311.76
Earth is flat and not a

12309.199 --> 12315.239000000001
sphere if water was sitting in the

12311.76 --> 12319.319
sphere then the reflection of that water

12315.239 --> 12324.399
would be like a reflection of a sphere

12319.319 --> 12324.399
like a mirror coated

12326.12 --> 12331.880000000001
ball a miror coated ball does not just

12329.56 --> 12335.64
reflect what is above

12331.88 --> 12338.039999999999
it like perfect mirror image that a

12335.64 --> 12340.88
perfect Mirror Image you only

12338.04 --> 12343.880000000001
get when it's a reflection of a flat

12340.88 --> 12343.88
surface

12349.72 --> 12352.239
Earth is

12374.52 --> 12378.239
flat h

12380.8 --> 12384.56
just drifting around that's

12386.08 --> 12392.76
hilarious make sure to bring your camera

12388.439 --> 12396.800000000001
if you do that maybe you could like

12392.76 --> 12398.6
film The Water reflection just like like

12396.8 --> 12402.039999999999
hey look at it this Mirror Image

12398.6 --> 12403.880000000001
reflection of of everything above it of

12402.04 --> 12405.92
the sky and things in the background I

12403.88 --> 12409.479
mean it's a mere image reflection that

12405.92 --> 12409.479
don't happens if the Earth is

12413.08 --> 12418.319
flat right so this is like one of those

12415.84 --> 12421.68
basic little things how you know the

12418.319 --> 12427.0
Earth is flat well because

12421.68 --> 12430.6
water reflects visuals like a

12427.0 --> 12430.6
mirror a flat

12432.08 --> 12440.439
mirror if bodies of water

12436.359 --> 12440.439
that are level and

12441.279 --> 12451.399000000001
still yeah if it reflects something

12447.04 --> 12454.0
perfectly like a mirror image then the

12451.399 --> 12457.479
Earth has to be flat CU if it was

12454.0 --> 12460.319
spherical bodies of water would align

12457.479 --> 12461.72
themselves with a curve because the

12460.319 --> 12465.039999999999
Earth is a sphere and it's going to

12461.72 --> 12467.96
adapt to that sphere with its level well

12465.04 --> 12470.439
then the reflections wouldn't be a

12467.96 --> 12473.239
perfect Mirror

12470.439 --> 12475.239
Image they would be bent all of it would

12473.239 --> 12478.479
be bent

12475.239 --> 12478.479
because it's

12480.239 --> 12486.198999999999
spherical I mean in a

12482.56 --> 12489.68
bent spherical mirror the reflections

12486.199 --> 12493.52
that come off that look very very

12489.68 --> 12497.0
different compared to the reflections

12493.52 --> 12499.399000000001
that come off a flat mirror

12497.0 --> 12501.96
only a flat mirror creates a mirror

12499.399 --> 12504.96
image that's

12501.96 --> 12507.479
identical spherical mirror can't do

12504.96 --> 12509.679999999998
that or just a little bit of curve

12507.479 --> 12514.479
mirror can't do that

12509.68 --> 12514.479000000001
either like it will look distorted

12544.359 --> 12548.68
right yeah I'm afraid I can't really fit

12546.359 --> 12552.720000000001
all of

12548.68 --> 12554.84
this in the title but it's been

12552.72 --> 12556.84
interesting but I think I'm G to round

12554.84 --> 12560.6
out the show now

12556.84 --> 12562.8
going at the 3 hours and 30 minutes Mark

12560.6 --> 12562.800000000001
by

12564.199 --> 12570.560000000001
now I hope everybody's enjoyed the

12567.479 --> 12573.119999999999
show I certainly did I'm very happy that

12570.56 --> 12577.16
everybody was here basically to be part

12573.12 --> 12579.84
of the show part of the chat I was not

12577.16 --> 12583.56
super chatty myself hope that that

12579.84 --> 12583.56
didn't bother anybody

12594.96 --> 12599.399
s a photo wether Park in

12600.04 --> 12603.04
Skype

12603.88 --> 12609.119999999999
oh cool yeah I'll share that for a

12611.96 --> 12617.96
bit this is the photo flatter Sage

12614.84 --> 12617.960000000001
shared with me

12626.439 --> 12630.960000000001
yeah that does look very cool to like go

12628.359 --> 12630.960000000001
around in a

12639.12 --> 12643.84
boat oh another one

12670.0 --> 12676.479
nice yeah that looks very Mirror Image

12673.68 --> 12677.92
doesn't it

12676.479 --> 12681.319
that doesn't really look like a

12677.92 --> 12681.319
spherical reflection at

12684.399 --> 12688.96
all well that's pretty surreal by the

12686.68 --> 12692.04
way that you can see that path just

12688.96 --> 12692.039999999999
going into the

12695.76 --> 12699.880000000001
water that's a pretty serious

12701.399 --> 12705.68
flood but whenever I see something like

12704.04 --> 12707.84
that it's always like oh this is where

12705.68 --> 12707.84
the

12708.399 --> 12715.278999999999
like the uh underwater people

12712.72 --> 12716.8
live like no it's supposed to be the

12715.279 --> 12718.439
path goes down there that's where the

12716.8 --> 12721.0
underwater people live like that's

12718.439 --> 12723.76
always what my imagination tells me when

12721.0 --> 12727.56
I see things like

12723.76 --> 12727.56
this like even as a

12727.92 --> 12733.76
kid like oh yeah the underwater people

12730.56 --> 12733.76
of course

12737.96 --> 12741.0
up to your waist

12748.76 --> 12757.0
damn yeah pretty cool looks cool nice

12754.56 --> 12758.88
photos and yeah maybe you should like go

12757.0 --> 12762.52
on a flotilla one time and just go

12758.88 --> 12766.198999999999
around there just see what that's like

12762.52 --> 12766.199
maybe film it

12772.64 --> 12778.439
right but I'm going to round out the

12774.92 --> 12781.359
show it was great it was nice amicable I

12778.439 --> 12784.6
really appreciate everybody being here

12781.359 --> 12786.84
and certainly have restored my faith

12784.6 --> 12790.84
that I did kind of lose yesterday when

12786.84 --> 12792.479
just nobody showed up at all like nobody

12790.84 --> 12794.52
with wrenches and today it's all full

12792.479 --> 12796.679999999998
with wrenches I'm very happy thank you

12794.52 --> 12800.92
for kind of making me extra effort to

12796.68 --> 12800.92
just show up I really appreciate

12802.68 --> 12809.76
that and it was nice and I feel good and

12806.319 --> 12812.72
that's important I mean it's

12809.76 --> 12815.239
important that I like share a good

12812.72 --> 12818.8
feeling and yesterday I did not

12815.239 --> 12822.039999999999
accomplish with that yesterday I left

12818.8 --> 12825.759999999998
like feeling really bitter and I'm sorry

12822.04 --> 12828.199
about that I really am and I'm sorry to

12825.76 --> 12830.72
WS myself but also to others it's like

12828.199 --> 12833.880000000001
yeah I was really bitter and that's not

12830.72 --> 12836.039999999999
how I want to end the show and I also

12833.88 --> 12839.039999999999
want to make effort that in the future

12836.04 --> 12842.239000000001
were that to happen again because of

12839.04 --> 12844.439
circumstances that I somehow figure out

12842.239 --> 12847.88
how to deal with that in the moment

12844.439 --> 12852.76
without just totally depleting myself

12847.88 --> 12854.88
like being completely de deenergized and

12852.76 --> 12857.72
still manage to continue on and not

12854.88 --> 12857.72
leave

12858.439 --> 12863.399
such a depleted feeling behind for

12861.64 --> 12866.198999999999
people because it's not nice I don't

12863.399 --> 12868.278999999999
want that it and it's not good for the

12866.199 --> 12869.6
show either it's not good for you guys

12868.279 --> 12872.12
it's not good for me it's not good for

12869.6 --> 12875.92
the show I I need that to change I need

12872.12 --> 12878.6
to figure it out I need to realize it is

12875.92 --> 12883.16
summer vacation period people are not

12878.6 --> 12883.16
going to always be able to be

12883.88 --> 12888.88
there I should know that from like the

12886.52 --> 12892.439
last 10 years every time the summer came

12888.88 --> 12895.64
about it's like you only get half the

12892.439 --> 12897.56
audience if you're lucky or days where

12895.64 --> 12900.96
it's just literally

12897.56 --> 12903.84
nobody and you just need to deal with it

12900.96 --> 12907.0
right and when September starts or late

12903.84 --> 12909.84
August everybody gets back again usually

12907.0 --> 12912.359
more refreshed than

12909.84 --> 12914.0
ever so I just got to learn to deal with

12912.359 --> 12916.76
that

12914.0 --> 12919.92
and next time I have like serious

12916.76 --> 12922.72
inspiration I need to just like Yay I

12919.92 --> 12925.64
got super heavy Insight I'll just need

12922.72 --> 12929.16
to put it down all alone because people

12925.64 --> 12931.278999999999
will watch it they will enjoy it they

12929.16 --> 12933.76
will be inspired by it but it I just

12931.279 --> 12936.16
can't expect everybody to be there in

12933.76 --> 12938.880000000001
the moment where it happens and I need

12936.16 --> 12941.64
to learn that I need to just need to

12938.88 --> 12941.64
learn to deal with

12941.88 --> 12948.319
it so that I don't demoralize myself

12945.12 --> 12948.319000000001
like what happened

12949.479 --> 12954.319
yesterday cuz then I like it does ruin

12952.439 --> 12957.0
my evening but this evening will

12954.319 --> 12959.56
definitely not be Ru I'm very again I'm

12957.0 --> 12961.199
going to keep thanking you guys I really

12959.56 --> 12963.84
appreciate I really appreciate the

12961.199 --> 12967.359
support too that I got from Mojo

12963.84 --> 12969.439
Luminati C support I I always say that I

12967.359 --> 12971.12
mean he just give it gives it generally

12969.439 --> 12973.319
but he started saying like for

12971.12 --> 12976.439
Illuminati son and ever since I'm like

12973.319 --> 12979.239
okay he is my dedicated Illuminati s

12976.439 --> 12981.16
supporter it's a thing I don't know if

12979.239 --> 12983.68
you mind

12981.16 --> 12986.399
Mojo but I'm just saying that it's just

12983.68 --> 12988.52
the thing just like whenever Owen

12986.399 --> 12990.519999999999
Benjamin something goes wrong he always

12988.52 --> 12993.439
blames codington and that's just the

12990.52 --> 12996.279
thing and so I'd like to have you be the

12993.439 --> 13000.0
Illuminati cant

12996.279 --> 13002.319000000001
support fund supporter

13000.0 --> 13005.92
so and yeah I appreciate that and I

13002.319 --> 13008.319
appreciate the support I'm getting from

13005.92 --> 13008.319
and I

13008.92 --> 13014.72
got from W Optimus as well who's sending

13013.0 --> 13017.279
me a new monitor which should be

13014.72 --> 13020.119999999999
arriving like any day I really wonder

13017.279 --> 13020.12
what that's going to be

13021.239 --> 13027.08
like cuz yeah this one it's still

13024.08 --> 13030.319
working but it just like the color just

13027.08 --> 13032.68
gets weird like the screen all gets blue

13030.319 --> 13036.039999999999
and then suddenly shading in film and

13032.68 --> 13038.279
all that becomes super weird cont try

13036.04 --> 13040.960000000001
and wrong and it's

13038.279 --> 13043.399000000001
annoying the monitor works it just has

13040.96 --> 13045.72
some weird color problems

13043.399 --> 13048.319
and and I'm really looking forward to

13045.72 --> 13052.16
having a new monitor or new secondhand

13048.319 --> 13052.16
one that's a slightly higher

13052.399 --> 13058.8
resolution called Summer because some

13055.52 --> 13061.6
are not here

13058.8 --> 13063.599999999999
huh that's very clever

13061.6 --> 13066.56
clearly

13063.6 --> 13068.52
right but uh yeah thanks everyone again
