[Music]

50.48 --> 55.459999999999994
oh good morning welcome to Flat Earth

53.699 --> 58.858999999999995

and if you haven't already subscribe to

65.4 --> 70.02000000000001
my channel hit the Bell notification so

weekdays and 2PM Amsterdam time in the

74.159 --> 78.96000000000001
weekend and please also do support me

76.439 --> 80.58
through the PayPal patreon Super Chat

78.96 --> 83.36
and the membership system join button

80.58 --> 86.9
they'll be much appreciated

83.36 --> 86.9
and yeah

87.479 --> 92.03999999999999
I went through all that support very

89.82 --> 94.979
quickly I did stock up on some important

92.04 --> 97.86000000000001
like details like

94.979 --> 100.67999999999999
new olive oil

97.86 --> 104.88
for my fries which are relatively cheap

100.68 --> 106.259
and nourishing to me it seems but

104.88 --> 109.92
can't

106.259 --> 112.52
forever just keep using the same oil

109.92 --> 112.52
uh

113.46 --> 118.5
or at least I can't

115.5 --> 121.32
because I can't filter

118.5 --> 124.979
like some of the really fine

121.32 --> 126.719
dust but potato dust that eventually

124.979 --> 129.899
starts heaping up and that's really

126.719 --> 133.379
unhealthy to cook in so or yeah to fry

129.899 --> 136.379
in but yeah that stuff is expensive and

133.379 --> 139.67999999999998
yeah other things supplements you know

136.379 --> 141.599
how this goes but

139.68 --> 144.9
still doing good

141.599 --> 148.57999999999998
I can hold out with this

144.9 --> 148.58
think probably till Monday

148.62 --> 153.9
but uh yeah

151.44 --> 155.819
any support would be great

153.9 --> 158.42000000000002
anyway

155.819 --> 158.42
the weather

160.44 --> 164.819
is weird

162.48 --> 168.72
very cloudy

164.819 --> 171.35999999999999
very moist still warm

168.72 --> 173.34
it's kind of an icky day

171.36 --> 175.94000000000003
I think the plants are just going wild

173.34 --> 175.94
with this

175.98 --> 180.42
like

177.36 --> 183.0
literally see where some of the grass

180.42 --> 185.39999999999998
out there has dried out and the parts

183.0 --> 187.68
that haven't dried out in between are

185.4 --> 190.56
literally like exploding

187.68 --> 193.37900000000002
since yeah yesterday since last night

190.56 --> 195.54
pretty much from all this moist

193.379 --> 199.67999999999998
and the dying down of the Heat

195.54 --> 203.879
also there's a big weed whacker tractor

199.68 --> 205.739
over there you can't see it from here

203.879 --> 208.56
just whacking

205.739 --> 210.36
really long weeds I don't know what it

208.56 --> 213.12
is

210.36 --> 216.18
some kind of grass or

213.12 --> 219.12
but it's like grown for over two meters

216.18 --> 221.64000000000001
tall and they're just whacking the [Â __Â ]

219.12 --> 226.14000000000001
out of it which is like on a sort of a

221.64 --> 228.29899999999998
Dyke Road in between the river and some

226.14 --> 229.7
pools or uh

228.299 --> 231.31900000000002
on that

229.7 --> 234.42
slot

231.319 --> 237.29899999999998
moat on the other side so it's like this

234.42 --> 239.33999999999997
narrow little road on a dike which is

237.299 --> 241.56
very typically Dutch by the way so you

239.34 --> 244.739
see that everywhere here

241.56 --> 247.459
and I love it it's Pinterest has a good

244.739 --> 247.459
feel to it

248.58 --> 251.87900000000002
they're whacking the [Â __Â ] out of it

250.26 --> 253.439
right now I'm hearing that in the

251.879 --> 256.21999999999997
background I have no idea if you guys

253.439 --> 256.21999999999997
can pick that up

256.56 --> 259.28000000000003
all right so

259.799 --> 264.419
hello

261.479 --> 265.56
it's like bear first in chat good to see

264.419 --> 267.65999999999997
you

265.56 --> 271.34
Susie yes

267.66 --> 271.34000000000003
hope you're all doing well

271.44 --> 277.5
been enjoying the the cool down a bit

275.759 --> 279.6
though I don't know what's it like in

277.5 --> 282.8
Australia

279.6 --> 282.8
what's winter there so

284.65 --> 287.839
[Music]

290.759 --> 294.78000000000003
ah

292.98 --> 297.18
[Music]

294.78 --> 300.29999999999995
I feel really weird today

297.18 --> 303.18
like puzzled but also

300.3 --> 305.28000000000003
like hungry and really strong really

303.18 --> 307.62
focused

305.28 --> 312.67999999999995
but my Consciousness is barely catching

307.62 --> 312.68
up really so today could be special

314.639 --> 317.36
uh

322.62 --> 330.36
right

324.479 --> 330.36
is Friday the 19th of August 2022

335.46 --> 340.44
I got the title from dreamwalking

337.8 --> 342.6
yesterday it's just basic formula a lot

340.44 --> 345.419
of basic formulas

342.6 --> 348.02000000000004
I'm very inspired I think just needs to

345.419 --> 348.02
get rolling

348.36 --> 351.78000000000003
so I was thinking about a whole bunch of

350.1 --> 353.22
things that I've even said like weeks

351.78 --> 355.44
ago

353.22 --> 357.90000000000003
about did remember the rock paper

355.44 --> 359.21999999999997
scissor

357.9 --> 362.28
thing

359.22 --> 364.56
pen sword Apple

362.28 --> 367.02
because that's that was like a really

364.56 --> 368.94
big fractal actually that I kind of hid

367.02 --> 370.85999999999996
inside of that game

368.94 --> 373.039
I wonder if many people caught on to

370.86 --> 373.039
that

373.68 --> 377.84000000000003
being like sub fractals from that

381.06 --> 387.01
like what if each of the three groups

384.12 --> 388.56
which are like a spirit a choice in life

387.01 --> 390.78
[Music]

388.56 --> 393.539
what if they knew

390.78 --> 395.69899999999996
who their

393.539 --> 398.759
what their weaknesses who their strong

395.699 --> 401.699
opponent is and then they

398.759 --> 404.759
from within the other route

401.699 --> 408.06
tried to become them

404.759 --> 411.47900000000004
to be safeguarded from them to

408.06 --> 412.86
neutralize any attempt to be opposed by

411.479 --> 418.38
them

412.86 --> 418.38
and so you get this weird web

420.72 --> 427.02000000000004
of cross-purpose tactics it's yeah I

424.08 --> 429.9
don't know maybe just tripping

427.02 --> 432.18
and then Super on time today yeah I know

429.9 --> 434.46
very proud of that but I was up very

432.18 --> 436.8
early like

434.46 --> 438.35999999999996
10 o'clock or something because I went

436.8 --> 440.699
to bed pretty early

438.36 --> 443.52000000000004
and

440.699 --> 446.41900000000004
I just got up it's really moist also as

443.52 --> 446.419
I was just like oh

448.04 --> 451.74
[Music]

449.52 --> 453.96
I just got up and I watched a bunch of

451.74 --> 456.66
oh and Benjamin I have so much to catch

453.96 --> 458.58
up on it's just

456.66 --> 459.96000000000004
maybe that's a good thing because then I

458.58 --> 463.25899999999996
have something to watch in the weekend

459.96 --> 464.94
last weekend I I watched I had watched

463.259 --> 467.16
all the Owen Benjamins

464.94 --> 468.86
before that and then it's just like the

467.16 --> 472.059
weekend oh hmm

468.86 --> 472.059
[Music]

473.879 --> 477.08000000000004
but he's on a roll

481.5 --> 486.259
right yeah what is the actual

483.0 --> 486.259
temperature I haven't checked

488.879 --> 495.86
23 degrees Celsius okay

492.18 --> 495.86
71 humidity

501.78 --> 505.44
right seems like it's going to be that

503.759 --> 509.40000000000003
like that

505.44 --> 511.74
up until Wednesday maybe Saturday

509.4 --> 514.279
might be more sunny

511.74 --> 514.279
right

523.08 --> 527.12
by the way hello Tara 306

530.64 --> 532.64
.

542.76 --> 547.92
four degrees we

545.16 --> 550.9399999999999
yeah that's kind of water cold

547.92 --> 550.9399999999999
not pleasant

557.16 --> 562.14
or

559.2 --> 564.839
back to India temperatures or was it

562.14 --> 567.38
always that it probably didn't change it

564.839 --> 567.3800000000001
did it

571.5 --> 575.899
oh yeah did you see net

577.26 --> 581.48
I don't remember

578.88 --> 581.48
whatever

582.66 --> 587.8389999999999
I'm very inspired but I also just feel

585.18 --> 587.8389999999999
Swampy

599.88 --> 605.579
all right BJC net

603.06 --> 608.04
oh that's very typical summer

605.579 --> 610.7399999999999
in like the last

608.04 --> 614.88
two decades they have to keep track of

610.74 --> 617.64
this stuff always in my mind it's don't

614.88 --> 620.22
keep any Charter or anything

617.64 --> 624.06
just started to notice that September's

620.22 --> 627.1800000000001
usually in the 90s was like the time

624.06 --> 630.1199999999999
when the really when the

627.18 --> 633.5999999999999
when the Autumn like really hits and it

630.12 --> 635.04
gets cold rain a lot of constant cold

633.6 --> 637.32
rain

635.04 --> 638.519
that's what used to happen a lot

637.32 --> 641.6400000000001
now

638.519 --> 643.32
in the 21st century it seems like it's

641.64 --> 645.1999999999999
shifted somewhat

643.32 --> 648.6800000000001
and now the summer

645.2 --> 648.6800000000001
lasts longer

649.079 --> 656.16
and it's it's like instead of a big blip

652.5 --> 659.339
and then an in a a quick reverse in

656.16 --> 662.04
temperature and entire seasonal Quick

659.339 --> 665.82
Change it's like it's split up it's

662.04 --> 668.64
become wider and more oscillated

665.82 --> 672.5400000000001
it's interesting

668.64 --> 676.079
so the Summers here on average have just

672.54 --> 678.0
lasted until like mid or even late

676.079 --> 680.04
September

678.0 --> 681.42
and it's not super hot anymore but

680.04 --> 684.0
that's great

681.42 --> 686.779
like that super heat isn't really all

684.0 --> 686.779
that fantastical

687.12 --> 692.88
it just dries out the grass

690.12 --> 694.86
although I bet that like farmers do have

692.88 --> 696.779
a lot of benefit from it

694.86 --> 697.5
if they plan

696.779 --> 700.75
they do

697.5 --> 700.75
[Music]

711.12 --> 714.66
but yeah that's what I noticed it's just

713.1 --> 718.22
the season

714.66 --> 718.2199999999999
summer is just more

719.399 --> 725.639
wider

720.839 --> 730.139
not more heat more extremities just

725.639 --> 734.399
like it's almost split up it's just this

730.139 --> 736.6800000000001
little bump wave thing instead of a big

734.399 --> 740.12
hill

736.68 --> 740.12
that lasts shorter

742.62 --> 744.8
foreign

747.38 --> 753.3
ERS also seem to have been overall at

751.26 --> 757.019
the same time also split up in the same

753.3 --> 759.18
way where often the if there is any snow

757.019 --> 761.4590000000001
or freezing that's really going to be

759.18 --> 763.9399999999999
significant it's like split up in two

761.459 --> 763.9399999999999
bumps

764.639 --> 767.0
really

768.42 --> 773.54
after December bump and then you have

770.399 --> 773.54
the February bump

774.26 --> 779.579
because typically around my birthday

777.36 --> 783.72
which is early February

779.579 --> 786.5999999999999
it snows for a week or something

783.72 --> 789.48
when before that no it didn't I'd even

786.6 --> 792.24
been almost kind of nice in between like

789.48 --> 795.0600000000001
it's a middle of winter type of spring

792.24 --> 796.74
break thingy can sometimes happen it's

795.06 --> 799.8599999999999
so interesting it's just like the

796.74 --> 803.4590000000001
weather oscillation the seasonal

799.86 --> 805.6800000000001
weather oscillation is different

803.459 --> 807.899
and there's a very deep dark World

805.68 --> 810.079
implication for me as well because it

807.899 --> 810.079
was

812.76 --> 817.86
it was something that was happening and

815.279 --> 820.56
I was like an agent of that

817.86 --> 822.899
like maybe it's a discovery of something

820.56 --> 825.3599999999999
that has just naturally changed or maybe

822.899 --> 826.74
it is actually a sort of a luciferian

825.36 --> 829.62
project

826.74 --> 831.9590000000001
change the oscillation of the weather by

829.62 --> 834.12
man somehow I don't even technically

831.959 --> 836.399
know how they would do that but maybe

834.12 --> 839.76
there is something there

836.399 --> 841.92
that has been shifted maybe maybe I did

839.76 --> 843.8389999999999
actually just go into the sixth

841.92 --> 847.139
Dimension this is gonna sound a bit

843.839 --> 850.1990000000001
fuzzy but it's actually really serious

847.139 --> 852.92
with the gears mechanical the mechanism

850.199 --> 852.92
of the heavens

852.959 --> 858.42
and then change its setting

855.959 --> 859.9799999999999
in a way that nobody's

858.42 --> 861.959
yeah

859.98 --> 865.5
maybe I did that

861.959 --> 868.7399999999999
or maybe that was simply the discovery

865.5 --> 872.04
of it it and then me basically my ego

868.74 --> 875.88
claiming it as if I did it or maybe it

872.04 --> 879.42
is that is how it works I don't know

875.88 --> 881.3389999999999
it's just this thing that played out

879.42 --> 882.8389999999999
and it's like no the weather is

881.339 --> 884.6990000000001
different now this is better for

882.839 --> 886.3800000000001
everything this is better for Industries

884.699 --> 889.16
it's better for plant life this is

886.38 --> 889.16
better for everything

890.339 --> 896.94
less extreme weather more even out a

894.18 --> 898.9799999999999
slight oscillation

896.94 --> 901.0790000000001
this sounds really Fantastical even

898.98 --> 902.639
coming out of my mouth but that is what

901.079 --> 905.519
I experienced in my Dark World station

902.639 --> 909.48
by the way lasted 80 years yeah freaking

905.519 --> 911.639
80 years is is so much time guys

909.48 --> 913.38
foreign

911.639 --> 916.98
and this was

913.38 --> 920.66
something that I was also doing there I

916.98 --> 920.66
was advocating for this

920.699 --> 924.199
weather pattern change

924.54 --> 928.8
and it's really weird even thinking

926.399 --> 931.86
about it now like with all the semantic

928.8 --> 935.639
of fractal implications like man-made

931.86 --> 935.639
climate change well

939.24 --> 945.199
not through CO2 or that kind of [Â __Â ] I

942.54 --> 945.199
can tell you that

945.66 --> 951.019
it's not any

947.639 --> 954.92
chemical or material based alteration

951.019 --> 954.92
that would be causing this

955.44 --> 958.8800000000001
it would definitely be

961.98 --> 970.139
energy based so maybe spiritual maybe

965.639 --> 972.6800000000001
technological maybe some weird mystical

970.139 --> 976.44
angel

972.68 --> 979.4399999999999
mechanisms that people can actually

976.44 --> 981.839
approach in the other dimension yeah

979.44 --> 984.0600000000001
okay this sounds really

981.839 --> 985.74
ethereal again

984.06 --> 988.699
as I was saying guys I'm a little

985.74 --> 988.699
inspired today

990.48 --> 993.72
[Music]

1002.06 --> 1007.1199999999999
hello Matthew Hall

1004.04 --> 1007.12
good to see you by the way

1009.199 --> 1011.8
oh

1016.339 --> 1019.339
ah

1020.72 --> 1026.6200000000001
oh that's a that's a huge Downer sorry

1027.5 --> 1032.679
yeah

1028.579 --> 1032.6789999999999
no I'm not gonna go there sorry guys

1033.26 --> 1037.579
I have my own memories with my cat and

1035.299 --> 1039.679
yeah I can attend to what he's saying

1037.579 --> 1042.319
uh

1039.679 --> 1044.6000000000001
I'm gonna go put

1042.319 --> 1047.74
my Illuminati kind of saw in the oven

1044.6 --> 1047.74
right now be right back

1117.2 --> 1123.039
and back hold on

1120.799 --> 1123.039
foreign

1137.66 --> 1141.26
right I've discovered a semantical

1139.88 --> 1144.14
aberration

1141.26 --> 1146.12
from my own lips

1144.14 --> 1148.039
might have said it yeah I don't even

1146.12 --> 1150.62
know if I done that on my live show or

1148.039 --> 1153.32
not I just mix up English words

1150.62 --> 1155.4189999999999
sometimes it's really weird try to go on

1153.32 --> 1158.62
a really high level

1155.419 --> 1158.6200000000001
and then I just

1158.84 --> 1166.8799999999999
make really basic switch room mistakes

1163.039 --> 1169.34
like for example when I say I would like

1166.88 --> 1173.66
to attest to that and I said it right

1169.34 --> 1175.58
this time sometimes I say I can atone to

1173.66 --> 1178.76
that

1175.58 --> 1180.1999999999998
but that is a really strange thing to

1178.76 --> 1183.44
say actually

1180.2 --> 1184.7
when that happens I usually mean to a

1183.44 --> 1186.1100000000001
test

1184.7 --> 1189.14
it's

1186.11 --> 1192.86
[Music]

1189.14 --> 1195.46
or it's like a bear witness to that

1192.86 --> 1200.1399999999999
I've experienced that myself anyway

1195.46 --> 1200.14
semantics I have to keep hammering on it

1202.76 --> 1211.1589999999999
was such a freaking big big language

1208.4 --> 1213.46
so much where it's so many ways to use

1211.159 --> 1213.46
them

1217.7 --> 1221.679
all right later Terry

1234.38 --> 1239.179
yes we just seen it I I by the way I

1237.14 --> 1240.3200000000002
totally agree on what you're talking

1239.179 --> 1242.419
about

1240.32 --> 1244.76
when it comes to direct weather

1242.419 --> 1249.1000000000001
alteration yeah

1244.76 --> 1249.1
Geo engineering is being done

1250.28 --> 1255.98
and I think it's an experiment overall

1254.0 --> 1257.78
and they don't exactly know what the

1255.98 --> 1260.9
consequences will be

1257.78 --> 1264.44
but they've set up a straw man

1260.9 --> 1267.8600000000001
of climate change through CO2 through

1264.44 --> 1270.5
engines and combustion

1267.86 --> 1273.6789999999999
to basically take the fall if it goes

1270.5 --> 1275.539
wrong it's really that devious

1273.679 --> 1277.46
right but that's not exactly what I'm

1275.539 --> 1280.059
talking about I'm not talking I'm

1277.46 --> 1280.059
talking about

1280.94 --> 1286.46
like seasonal

1283.72 --> 1288.919
influences right there is like

1286.46 --> 1291.32
other things than just there's like how

1288.919 --> 1294.5800000000002
strong is the Sun

1291.32 --> 1294.58
how strong is the Moon

1295.1 --> 1300.62
throughout the year that there is like

1297.919 --> 1302.179
an energy oscillation that basically

1300.62 --> 1305.539
forms

1302.179 --> 1309.6200000000001
what results to us in the

1305.539 --> 1314.96
weather patterns in the seasons right

1309.62 --> 1316.8799999999999
well what if that energy input influx

1314.96 --> 1319.64
which seems to have a very specific

1316.88 --> 1322.64
pattern what if that is altered

1319.64 --> 1325.7
and how would that have been altered

1322.64 --> 1328.5200000000002
would it have always occurred was it

1325.7 --> 1330.2
like a designer's decision it would just

1328.52 --> 1332.0
switch like the next

1330.2 --> 1336.2
gear in a clock

1332.0 --> 1338.78
or is it actually a man-made alteration

1336.2 --> 1340.94
through some kind of I don't know

1338.78 --> 1343.94
mystical

1340.94 --> 1343.94
interference

1350.84 --> 1353.3799999999999
right

1358.77 --> 1364.82
[Music]

1362.539 --> 1366.799
that by the way would be kept completely

1364.82 --> 1368.83
secret from the general public

1366.799 --> 1372.349
absolutely

1368.83 --> 1372.349
[Music]

1376.34 --> 1382.34
right but maybe the anticipation even of

1379.64 --> 1383.6000000000001
that oscillation switch was just kind of

1382.34 --> 1385.9399999999998
like the

1383.6 --> 1389.299
starting ground

1385.94 --> 1391.48
that even spot the idea of climate

1389.299 --> 1391.48
change

1392.12 --> 1396.62
that like they knew something was going

1394.46 --> 1399.7
to come and they just had to exploit it

1396.62 --> 1399.6999999999998
type of thing

1400.039 --> 1402.58
right

1410.2 --> 1414.74
we're all our own bosses Professor Phil

1413.6 --> 1418.4189999999999
Bell

1414.74 --> 1418.419
it's technically Anarchy

1426.799 --> 1432.44
the boss is whoever a person in the

1429.799 --> 1434.62
moment designates to be their boss or

1432.44 --> 1434.6200000000001
not

1435.08 --> 1439.36
it's born from respect mostly

1441.82 --> 1447.1
and just truth and ability to

1448.039 --> 1451.96
to put things down you want to hear

1458.0 --> 1462.58
hey Tony Whitcomb

1460.039 --> 1462.58
that's

1463.52 --> 1468.62
a Phil you were really making an ass out

1466.039 --> 1470.9
of yourself out there man I'm getting

1468.62 --> 1476.02
all these kind of

1470.9 --> 1476.02
comment feedbacks on Skype it's dude

1477.799 --> 1483.74
you you need to lay down on the uh some

1481.22 --> 1485.84
of these weird outbursts not that it's

1483.74 --> 1488.659
aggressive or anything it's just really

1485.84 --> 1490.9599999999998
stupid and like you you don't need to do

1488.659 --> 1490.96
that

1493.159 --> 1497.779
please try to hold on to your sanity a

1496.279 --> 1500.26
little longer

1497.779 --> 1500.26
okay

1515.18 --> 1518.3590000000002
[Music]

1519.44 --> 1524.72
we are all individuals

1522.26 --> 1527.24
yes we are

1524.72 --> 1530.2
I love that scene from

1527.24 --> 1530.2
Life of Brian

1531.38 --> 1537.14
no you have to follow yourselves we're

1534.98 --> 1542.299
all individuals

1537.14 --> 1542.2990000000002
yes yes we're all individuals

1561.279 --> 1564.52

1565.1 --> 1570.58

1566.9 --> 1570.5800000000002
darp con three

1577.159 --> 1582.8600000000001
I'm not an individual yeah perfect

1585.38 --> 1589.659
oh those guys they're so great

1590.44 --> 1596.0
3.3 oh here you go again there's no

1593.48 --> 1599.5
fraction scale

1596.0 --> 1599.5
secret star whatever

1601.279 --> 1607.829
uh how dare you

1604.77 --> 1607.829
[Music]

1617.08 --> 1623.299
no no it isn't better Phil no you're

1621.919 --> 1627.98
wrong

1623.299 --> 1630.02
that's not an accurate percentage

1627.98 --> 1631.58
oh it's probably more in the direction

1630.02 --> 1635.86
of

1631.58 --> 1635.86
let's say 87 percent

1638.179 --> 1645.6200000000001
it's absolutely not

1640.48 --> 1648.94
99.99 of people on earth no it isn't

1645.62 --> 1648.9399999999998
I guarantee it

1650.89 --> 1657.38
[Music]

1654.1 --> 1659.1789999999999
and only a lack of information and

1657.38 --> 1662.5390000000002
gatekeeping is really even what's

1659.179 --> 1664.94
keeping that 87 what it is because as

1662.539 --> 1668.539
soon as they all just openly learn

1664.94 --> 1671.3600000000001
it's probably going to be more like

1668.539 --> 1674.059
five to ten percent

1671.36 --> 1676.34
that's gonna be left actually leaving it

1674.059 --> 1678.62
even after confrontation and they will

1676.34 --> 1681.4399999999998
all turn into anti-flatter authors

1678.62 --> 1682.52
the old innocent Globe belief that we

1681.44 --> 1687.22
knew

1682.52 --> 1687.22
will be no more for this time being

1701.6 --> 1706.1789999999999
Ah that's cool flatter Sage

1723.38 --> 1729.0800000000002
I feel really bad about Matthew Hall I

1725.96 --> 1731.299
mean I got way too much when he was

1729.08 --> 1734.84
saying I my empathy was literally giving

1731.299 --> 1736.94
me heavy feedback and I don't want to

1734.84 --> 1740.899
migrate to that frequency

1736.94 --> 1742.3990000000001
but I I really I really well empathize

1740.899 --> 1746.12
with him

1742.399 --> 1748.82
I mean I was devastated when my

1746.12 --> 1751.8799999999999
my cat died like absolutely devastated

1748.82 --> 1753.98
this is a nice combination with my ex

1751.88 --> 1756.0800000000002
having dumped me like half a year before

1753.98 --> 1758.6
that

1756.08 --> 1760.46
and not being with my cat

1758.6 --> 1762.799
because she had it

1760.46 --> 1764.72
and she didn't like her she didn't like

1762.799 --> 1766.22
really hate her but

1764.72 --> 1768.38
she had a bird

1766.22 --> 1770.659
that bird it was really a weird

1768.38 --> 1774.38
situation but I made it work

1770.659 --> 1776.72
for like three years I made it work it

1774.38 --> 1780.3400000000001
could work I could have like they could

1776.72 --> 1780.34
be both in the same room

1781.039 --> 1785.96
and I could keep my cat's Instinct under

1783.679 --> 1790.48
control because of the psionic

1785.96 --> 1790.48
connection I mean she was effectively my

1795.919 --> 1802.96
I had a special connection mentally it

1798.62 --> 1802.9599999999998
was it was palpable it was testable

1803.36 --> 1807.32
but uh

1804.919 --> 1810.8200000000002
yeah am I familiar

1807.32 --> 1810.82
is what I used to call it

1815.059 --> 1820.0
but I got so much good energy I I just

1817.76 --> 1820.0
can't

1820.7 --> 1825.559
really dig into that but I will keep it

1823.82 --> 1828.98
in mind

1825.559 --> 1830.779
because yeah he's gonna be in grief for

1828.98 --> 1834.3990000000001
a while

1830.779 --> 1834.399
it's very close to Heart a pet

1851.539 --> 1854.14
hmm

1857.24 --> 1861.86
hold Time end

1859.58 --> 1862.6999999999998
this thing changed when talking about

1861.86 --> 1864.26
the

1862.7 --> 1867.7
what

1864.26 --> 1867.7
when you're talking about rig black

1891.799 --> 1898.46
right oh yeah no I'm I know I know I

1895.82 --> 1900.6399999999999
didn't steam wall it's just that I

1898.46 --> 1900.64
foreign

1903.1 --> 1909.019
I just immediately try to make that an

1907.039 --> 1910.82
item in the moment and we'll take care

1909.019 --> 1912.26
of it or something and he was gonna go

1910.82 --> 1914.24
anyway and

1912.26 --> 1915.3799999999999
seemed like so grief struck and it was

1914.24 --> 1917.659
like

1915.38 --> 1918.98
and I'm so I have so much inspiration

1917.659 --> 1920.8400000000001
energy

1918.98 --> 1922.88
sounds harsh but it feels almost like a

1920.84 --> 1925.36
waste of focus and I'm on that sort of

1922.88 --> 1925.3600000000001
thing now

1927.38 --> 1932.74
and that's kind of what I feel guilty

1929.84 --> 1932.74
about a bit I guess

1935.6 --> 1938.26
anyway

1941.899 --> 1947.299
do you think Fe will be on the

1945.14 --> 1949.5800000000002
curriculum in schools well Professor

1947.299 --> 1951.799
Phil Bill how about

1949.58 --> 1954.76
schools you say

1951.799 --> 1954.76
what's a school

1958.279 --> 1962.24
I think there's going to be a giant war

1960.2 --> 1965.8400000000001
against schools

1962.24 --> 1968.8990000000001
because it has been a hearth of satanic

1965.84 --> 1972.32
Corruption of all sorts

1968.899 --> 1976.2199999999998
it is where they seed things I've

1972.32 --> 1980.0
recognized that in teachers there's like

1976.22 --> 1981.98
serious dark agents spread out in

1980.0 --> 1984.2
schools everywhere

1981.98 --> 1986.779
they've been there for a while it might

1984.2 --> 1989.8990000000001
be like a keystone

1986.779 --> 1992.779
Freemason project or something

1989.899 --> 1996.3799999999999
what's keeping it like that

1992.779 --> 1998.539
but schools are so corrupted that

1996.38 --> 2000.22
effectively it's more it's better if

1998.539 --> 2001.72
everything everybody just transitioned

2000.22 --> 2004.0
into homeschooling

2001.72 --> 2006.3990000000001
it would give them a chance to literally

2004.0 --> 2008.019
just ReDiscover their own Humanity in

2006.399 --> 2010.36
the process

2008.019 --> 2012.279
right

2010.36 --> 2014.26
and then eventually it might become

2012.279 --> 2016.24
completely decentralized where there

2014.26 --> 2018.039
will be just like

2016.24 --> 2019.8990000000001
I guess teachers

2018.039 --> 2022.12
out there

2019.899 --> 2024.6
that are really effective and they will

2022.12 --> 2027.1
just like have class

2024.6 --> 2029.399
pre-organized but outside of a school

2027.1 --> 2029.399
system

2030.64 --> 2036.94
it would be more like a course type

2034.179 --> 2039.779
thing I think that the whole school set

2036.94 --> 2043.8990000000001
up even for children could be

2039.779 --> 2045.159
redirected towards just course type

2043.899 --> 2047.26
schooling

2045.159 --> 2050.32
instead of

2047.26 --> 2052.54
like being stuck in a place for a very

2050.32 --> 2054.52
long time with the whole bunch of people

2052.54 --> 2056.639
and a teacher that you're kind of stuck

2054.52 --> 2056.639
with

2057.7 --> 2063.6389999999997
because it's just it's all breaking

2060.22 --> 2066.0989999999997
apart and I mean the schools universally

2063.639 --> 2068.5
have been under like teachers are under

2066.099 --> 2072.579
pressures that are just

2068.5 --> 2075.159
irrational I know because my mother was

2072.579 --> 2076.8990000000003
one of them and she really always tried

2075.159 --> 2078.879
to take all the big weights on her

2076.899 --> 2081.7599999999998
shoulder and she would just go mental

2078.879 --> 2085.24
sometimes from it

2081.76 --> 2089.159
and always more work always always at

2085.24 --> 2089.1589999999997
home always more more and more just

2091.179 --> 2093.7200000000003
so

2095.8 --> 2101.8
I think that schooling

2098.64 --> 2103.7799999999997
in general might go through a big

2101.8 --> 2105.94
transformation

2103.78 --> 2108.579
I think that with the arrival of the

2105.94 --> 2111.16
internet yeah

2108.579 --> 2115.2400000000002
it's it's become out in an outdated

2111.16 --> 2117.64
format not that you don't need

2115.24 --> 2120.16
people in a class

2117.64 --> 2122.68
and a teacher that can be a very good

2120.16 --> 2125.5
setup it's just that

2122.68 --> 2128.7999999999997
you're no longer fully dependent on the

2125.5 --> 2131.56
distribution of information like that

2128.8 --> 2135.2200000000003
right there's the internet now

2131.56 --> 2137.2
so you're not dependent on that format

2135.22 --> 2140.14
to keep persisting

2137.2 --> 2143.3199999999997
like that with all the crazy pressures

2140.14 --> 2144.8199999999997
that are coming and are getting worse on

2143.32 --> 2147.04
teachers like what they have to deal

2144.82 --> 2149.7000000000003
with

2147.04 --> 2149.7
so

2150.4 --> 2154.0
best regard from Banks yeah yeah by the

2152.619 --> 2159.06
way yeah thanks I got a little PayPal

2154.0 --> 2159.06
from Bex thank you Bax shout out to Bax

2159.22 --> 2161.9399999999996
uh

2163.78 --> 2169.3590000000004
yeah scent children do need social

2165.94 --> 2172.839
interactions right and that's why

2169.359 --> 2175.5989999999997
like the format of a classroom should

2172.839 --> 2178.599
still persist is just not through a

2175.599 --> 2180.88
school a course system

2178.599 --> 2184.599
which could be very decentralized it

2180.88 --> 2189.2200000000003
could be Community organized it could be

2184.599 --> 2191.8590000000004
just yeah it will probably be

2189.22 --> 2193.24
it would just be people in the area that

2191.859 --> 2195.72
are inspired and they're they're just

2193.24 --> 2198.9399999999996
like will be like a one-man class

2195.72 --> 2200.4399999999996
perhaps and they do a certain thing and

2198.94 --> 2203.079
well

2200.44 --> 2205.96
and it might have their own curriculum

2203.079 --> 2206.98
and then you can literally choose or

2205.96 --> 2208.96
yeah

2206.98 --> 2211.359
choose not to

2208.96 --> 2213.04
and there should be more options there

2211.359 --> 2217.38
should be yeah you see you can just

2213.04 --> 2217.38
completely decentralize it

2218.14 --> 2222.46
if you have a lot of options a lot of

2220.54 --> 2224.02
different teachers that teach their

2222.46 --> 2226.599
thing

2224.02 --> 2228.52
then you can

2226.599 --> 2231.099
check them all out see what's going on

2228.52 --> 2233.8
see what's being taught

2231.099 --> 2236.5
and then yeah people could basically

2233.8 --> 2237.82
just agree naturally on like this is a

2236.5 --> 2239.68
really good teacher everything they

2237.82 --> 2242.1400000000003
teach is good and it's and it's really

2239.68 --> 2245.7999999999997
like and with the times but in a good

2242.14 --> 2248.7999999999997
way and resistant again bad influences

2245.8 --> 2251.92
etc etc right and that would be probably

2248.8 --> 2254.2000000000003
become politically sensitive after a

2251.92 --> 2257.5
certain point

2254.2 --> 2260.859
but yeah she can be helped

2257.5 --> 2264.52
that's what I think

2260.859 --> 2269.2599999999998
part of his home school Co-op what

2264.52 --> 2272.619
exactly like you're describing thank you

2269.26 --> 2275.8590000000004
it's just that the school system

2272.619 --> 2277.839
the systems like that

2275.859 --> 2280.42
they've become outdated and they're

2277.839 --> 2283.72
already kind of corporatized in a way

2280.42 --> 2286.7400000000002
and well many regions in the world

2283.72 --> 2288.9399999999996
especially United States they're just

2286.74 --> 2290.68
corrupted corporations they're like

2288.94 --> 2294.9
hostile

2290.68 --> 2294.8999999999996
their marxistence and stuff

2295.24 --> 2298.0789999999997
and they just

2298.48 --> 2305.44
they just took it over

2300.82 --> 2305.44
because it was being kept

2305.56 --> 2312.18
and

2307.06 --> 2312.18
well yeah it's just become so exploited

2313.24 --> 2318.4599999999996
right so decentralization more

2315.88 --> 2321.04
competition is the answer

2318.46 --> 2324.339
like why would you oh I have to pick

2321.04 --> 2326.619
this or that or that University that's

2324.339 --> 2328.44
gonna cost me at least like ten thousand

2326.619 --> 2331.599
dollars or something

2328.44 --> 2334.9
oh oh really so what about if you just

2331.599 --> 2336.52
had a choice between like a thousand

2334.9 --> 2339.46
different teachers

2336.52 --> 2341.619
and all have like a course that's all

2339.46 --> 2344.619
relevant or you might agree on whether

2341.619 --> 2346.9
something is relevant or not

2344.619 --> 2349.78
and then you could just

2346.9 --> 2352.0
pick it make a deal this is the time

2349.78 --> 2354.9
this is the cost

2352.0 --> 2354.9
like courses

2355.06 --> 2359.44
and then rely on that

2357.579 --> 2362.1400000000003
you would have to basically make your

2359.44 --> 2364.18
own program instead of having the

2362.14 --> 2367.54
teachers all together like oh how are we

2364.18 --> 2369.8199999999997
gonna get this schedule fit because

2367.54 --> 2372.64
that's always freaking hectic every time

2369.82 --> 2374.32
like well you would have to do that

2372.64 --> 2377.74
yourself then

2374.32 --> 2379.839
either the parent or if the student is

2377.74 --> 2381.9399999999996
old enough and has figured it out they

2379.839 --> 2384.54
can do it for themselves they will be

2381.94 --> 2384.54
responsible

2384.64 --> 2390.64
right I mean if you are responsible for

2387.64 --> 2393.04
your own education literally you while

2390.64 --> 2395.68
you're even young wouldn't you take more

2393.04 --> 2396.82
effort to get something out of it to get

2395.68 --> 2401.339
it right

2396.82 --> 2404.38
you wouldn't just oh I have to do this

2401.339 --> 2406.359
no no you're responsible

2404.38 --> 2407.859
and not because parents keep telling you

2406.359 --> 2409.24
you're responsible yeah that doesn't

2407.859 --> 2410.859
mean anything because they're not

2409.24 --> 2413.319
they're just stuck in a stupid program

2410.859 --> 2414.7599999999998
like what if they literally had the

2413.319 --> 2419.079
responsibility

2414.76 --> 2421.119
to pick out the courses of Education

2419.079 --> 2422.26
they'd be a lot more invested wouldn't

2421.119 --> 2424.839
they

2422.26 --> 2428.099
because they had their control over

2424.839 --> 2428.099
their own destiny now

2428.14 --> 2434.2799999999997
I'm serious guys this is

2430.839 --> 2434.2799999999997
quite inspired

2438.94 --> 2443.2000000000003
right and that technically wouldn't even

2441.04 --> 2446.56
have to be any kind of age limit on that

2443.2 --> 2448.2999999999997
I mean yeah for its Kitty [Â __Â ] yeah but

2446.56 --> 2450.7
who what kind of older person would go

2448.3 --> 2454.119
to that's ridiculous but courses still

2450.7 --> 2456.7
happen out there I mean My Healer even

2454.119 --> 2460.0
still does courses my dad does courses

2456.7 --> 2463.06
and they're like in their 70s

2460.0 --> 2468.28
they're still learning and it works just

2463.06 --> 2472.2999999999997
go guy you know he's got the good stuff

2468.28 --> 2474.3390000000004
and he teaches you things that are very

2472.3 --> 2478.1800000000003
in line with what they're already doing

2474.339 --> 2482.98
on themselves so that's

2478.18 --> 2486.04
the new education format decentralized

2482.98 --> 2487.54
wide range of options you can choose

2486.04 --> 2490.18
your own

2487.54 --> 2493.119
things right but it's not going to cost

2490.18 --> 2495.2799999999997
you like ten thousand dollars

2493.119 --> 2497.38
so you end up with gender studies right

2495.28 --> 2499.0
I mean yeah sure there will be a stupid

2497.38 --> 2500.56
teacher out there that who have gender

2499.0 --> 2502.9
studies right because there's going to

2500.56 --> 2505.24
be a market for it

2502.9 --> 2507.28
but they're not gonna like charge you

2505.24 --> 2509.0789999999997
freaking ten thousand dollars and if

2507.28 --> 2511.3590000000004
they would and you take it you'd be an

2509.079 --> 2513.04
absolute [Â __Â ] because you're on your

2511.359 --> 2514.9
own that's your fault nobody's gonna

2513.04 --> 2518.94
make you take that

2514.9 --> 2518.94
right because it's decentralized

2520.72 --> 2526.9599999999996
but yeah dude

2524.02 --> 2529.66
this is the way to go for the world for

2526.96 --> 2532.0
America or Europe

2529.66 --> 2535.18
and any other country out there pretty

2532.0 --> 2537.22
much I'd say every country like even

2535.18 --> 2540.22
third world countries would thrive on

2537.22 --> 2542.56
this every country would benefit

2540.22 --> 2545.2
with the internet though internet would

2542.56 --> 2546.819
be kind of important

2545.2 --> 2551.52
because otherwise how are you going to

2546.819 --> 2551.52
know what all these teachers do right

2551.74 --> 2556.0
without the internet you wouldn't have

2554.2 --> 2558.5789999999997
like oh a list that you could just

2556.0 --> 2561.16
figure out click oh this is what they're

2558.579 --> 2562.2400000000002
teaching and then just decide no you

2561.16 --> 2564.5789999999997
would need the Internet for that

2562.24 --> 2566.859
otherwise you'd get the same issues

2564.579 --> 2569.44
you'd have to have a centralized

2566.859 --> 2572.02
building and everybody knows that oh

2569.44 --> 2572.98
yeah that's where you can figure that

2572.02 --> 2575.079
out

2572.98 --> 2577.9
then you end up with the same thing it's

2575.079 --> 2580.3
it's back to a school model again if you

2577.9 --> 2583.6600000000003
do that you see

2580.3 --> 2587.319
so the internet is essential

2583.66 --> 2589.6189999999997
to have this type of new schooling

2587.319 --> 2589.619
system

2590.74 --> 2597.819
I'm very inspired today

2594.46 --> 2601.359
is gender fluidity skills

2597.819 --> 2606.0
it sounds more like a property

2601.359 --> 2606.0
uh break back gross

2610.119 --> 2616.3
a change don't oh God you guys are

2613.54 --> 2618.099
acting like kids

2616.3 --> 2620.5
no

2618.099 --> 2622.2400000000002
no the point is gender studies are not

2620.5 --> 2625.54
important it should never be forced on

2622.24 --> 2628.0
anybody especially kids but there might

2625.54 --> 2630.099
be people interested for whatever reason

2628.0 --> 2631.54
maybe they're like really fanatical that

2630.099 --> 2633.52
can you stop them

2631.54 --> 2636.16
but you can stop them from forcing it

2633.52 --> 2638.859
onto your kids yeah but you can't stop

2636.16 --> 2641.319
them from doing it

2638.859 --> 2643.839
themselves because they choose to so

2641.319 --> 2646.18
there probably would also be gender

2643.839 --> 2648.16
study teachers and maybe there will be a

2646.18 --> 2649.5989999999997
whole bunch of like thousands of gender

2648.16 --> 2651.94
study teachers because they're like oh

2649.599 --> 2654.1600000000003
my God finally I can do this they're

2651.94 --> 2657.16
like uh yeah that's what you studied for

2654.16 --> 2662.56
all your life goody and it's going to be

2657.16 --> 2665.14
kind of useless but nobody's gonna Force

2662.56 --> 2666.88
right nobody's going to be forced

2665.14 --> 2669.339
to actually

2666.88 --> 2671.7400000000002
go to those teachers and learn about

2669.339 --> 2674.2
that that's the difference that's what

2671.74 --> 2675.7599999999998
the schooling system kind of does for us

2674.2 --> 2678.04
because you have a curriculum it's

2675.76 --> 2680.1400000000003
forced

2678.04 --> 2682.72
they just put it in there politically

2680.14 --> 2686.44
and then you have to face that all the

2682.72 --> 2688.24
time and protest it etc etc right well

2686.44 --> 2691.839
if it's decentralized

2688.24 --> 2694.0
then nobody can force you to send your

2691.839 --> 2696.839
kid to gender studies

2694.0 --> 2696.839
it's that simple

2703.119 --> 2709.0
what does

2704.819 --> 2711.339
a-s-a-e-l-p mean jado what

2709.0 --> 2713.5
apprenticeship yeah I guess seeking it

2711.339 --> 2716.38
is close to apprenticeship seeking style

2713.5 --> 2718.119
water but it's it is like it is a

2716.38 --> 2720.6400000000003
multi-branch apprenticeship because of

2718.119 --> 2722.2000000000003
the internet I mean can you imagine

2720.64 --> 2725.56
apprenticeship

2722.2 --> 2727.18
but instead of being the blacksmith's

2725.56 --> 2730.48
Apprentice or something

2727.18 --> 2733.54
You're The Apprentice of like who knows

2730.48 --> 2735.52
a hundred maybe you're like super brainy

2733.54 --> 2737.38
and you want to know absolutely every

2735.52 --> 2739.54
skill everything and you somehow have

2737.38 --> 2741.6400000000003
this potential you could just follow

2739.54 --> 2743.98
freaking hundreds of them

2741.64 --> 2745.2999999999997
you could be Apprentice with a hundred

2743.98 --> 2747.88
different people

2745.3 --> 2750.28
under different skills that would have

2747.88 --> 2751.54
never been possible in like Medieval Era

2750.28 --> 2753.46
because they didn't have the internet

2751.54 --> 2758.339
was all Word of Mouth it was all

2753.46 --> 2758.339
reputation and stiff competition

2758.98 --> 2761.88
survival

2764.859 --> 2769.9
right you did you'd like you'd have to

2767.68 --> 2773.56
like there was like Guild Wars and [Â __Â ]

2769.9 --> 2777.52
so one type of blacksmith might try to

2773.56 --> 2781.68
assassinate another in secret because

2777.52 --> 2781.68
yeah he was taking his turf

2782.319 --> 2786.88
well you don't have issues to that

2785.2 --> 2789.819
degree if that would happen that just

2786.88 --> 2791.859
straight out criminal but

2789.819 --> 2795.339
I mean yeah nothing's going to stop

2791.859 --> 2797.14
criminal elements from trying to destroy

2795.339 --> 2798.64
any new system that's gonna arrive

2797.14 --> 2800.0789999999997
they're gonna try to corrupt it in one

2798.64 --> 2802.1189999999997
way or another so maybe there will be

2800.079 --> 2803.5
like thugs around and like oh you have

2802.119 --> 2805.48
to follow this course and we're going to

2803.5 --> 2807.579
test you you don't get it right we're

2805.48 --> 2809.98
gonna beat you up oh that's basically

2807.579 --> 2812.5600000000004
straight up called Criminal

2809.98 --> 2815.68
of course and that should absolutely be

2812.56 --> 2818.02
arrested people that do that

2815.68 --> 2820.54
and you should absolutely freaking

2818.02 --> 2823.18
report it to the police and they should

2820.54 --> 2826.0
abso freaking lutely respond to that and

2823.18 --> 2829.0
not be caught up in some scheme

2826.0 --> 2831.099
corruption [Â __Â ] so yeah problems will

2829.0 --> 2833.2
always come back but I think that a

2831.099 --> 2834.76
completely decentralized schooling

2833.2 --> 2836.74
system with the help of the internet

2834.76 --> 2839.7400000000002
could be

2836.74 --> 2839.74
revolutionary

2843.28 --> 2845.76
anyway

2847.14 --> 2852.48
and I think that the old school model

2849.46 --> 2852.48
has become outdated

2852.88 --> 2858.0
and to

2854.859 --> 2858.0
to exploit it

2860.5 --> 2867.059
which is basically corruption anyway

2864.339 --> 2867.0589999999997
huh

2871.14 --> 2876.2999999999997
astral gender what the [Â __Â ] are you

2873.819 --> 2876.3
talking about

2881.74 --> 2884.4599999999996
hey menu

2888.819 --> 2894.119
school system what

2891.46 --> 2897.3
I don't know I'm gonna get my uh

2894.119 --> 2897.3
Illuminati Castle

2955.3 --> 2957.9

2961.96 --> 2966.3
that's not even funny that's just not

2964.72 --> 2973.1189999999997
funny

2966.3 --> 2977.46
[Music]

2973.119 --> 2977.46

3033.18 --> 3037.7999999999997
much

3035.22 --> 3040.5
I'd really appreciate it if you stop

3037.8 --> 3043.44
making freaking bug jokes I mean

3040.5 --> 3046.4
you're my guys you're not supposed to be

[Music]

3096.18 --> 3100.16
I have done so for like three years

3151.5 --> 3155.9
education should be a right

3156.359 --> 3159.2
oh really

3159.72 --> 3165.7799999999997
which education should that be is that

3162.72 --> 3167.819
the education that you want

3165.78 --> 3169.44
should that the education that the kid

3167.819 --> 3172.44
wants or that the parent of the kid

3169.44 --> 3174.68
wants or which education exactly is a

3172.44 --> 3174.68
right

3177.78 --> 3183.5400000000004
quite sure that education is a privilege

3180.079 --> 3185.46
nobody has the right to be

3183.54 --> 3187.319
educated

3185.46 --> 3189.859
about things that are none of their

3187.319 --> 3189.859
freaking business

3194.89 --> 3197.94
[Music]

3204.0 --> 3209.22
if you say basic education some kind of

3207.24 --> 3212.7
basic education

3209.22 --> 3214.98
I'd say okay fair enough it's kind of

3212.7 --> 3218.48
almost like a un Charter kind of thing

3214.98 --> 3218.48
like oh yeah okay

3218.76 --> 3223.28
thank you

3220.68 --> 3223.2799999999997
it's

3236.64 --> 3240.5589999999997
yeah all right having some delay hmm

3260.66 --> 3263.66
thank you

3264.18 --> 3269.5789999999997
how do you know our teachers are telling

3266.4 --> 3272.28
the truth mind well that's the whole

3269.579 --> 3274.98
thing in a decentralized

3272.28 --> 3278.4
education system

3274.98 --> 3280.26
you can just ask them

3278.4 --> 3283.02
and

3280.26 --> 3284.7000000000003
if they lie about it and they bring it

3283.02 --> 3287.94
up anyway

3284.7 --> 3290.7
then your kid should absolutely mention

3287.94 --> 3294.299
that and then you can

3290.7 --> 3298.16
probably sue them for fraud because they

3294.299 --> 3298.16
did not deliver on their promise

3301.559 --> 3307.6400000000003
they basically did false advertisement

3304.619 --> 3307.6400000000003
right it's that simple

3330.96 --> 3338.76
everyone no no Professor Phil bill

3334.98 --> 3341.16
no free education is absurd

3338.76 --> 3344.3390000000004
who's going to pay for that

3341.16 --> 3345.839
I mean every freaking [Â __Â ] would be

3344.339 --> 3347.88
sent to such a school and what are they

3345.839 --> 3349.74
going to do with it nothing because they

3347.88 --> 3353.339
were never really capable they just

3349.74 --> 3356.7
could because it's free

3353.339 --> 3358.799
and so problems all over again

3356.7 --> 3362.339
yeah socialism

3358.799 --> 3364.319
is not the answer always ends up in

3362.339 --> 3366.68
existential problems that cannot be

3364.319 --> 3366.68
solved

3376.74 --> 3379.2799999999997
no

3386.28 --> 3390.3190000000004
education should not be free

3397.38 --> 3402.6800000000003
it's a mess if you do that it's just a

3400.5 --> 3402.68
mess

3415.619 --> 3418.2200000000003
yeah

3418.26 --> 3422.0400000000004
right because you see Professor Phil

3420.48 --> 3424.859
Bell

3422.04 --> 3426.48
the benefits were how far outweigh the

3424.859 --> 3429.119
cost no they wouldn't

3426.48 --> 3431.7
they would absolutely not I mean yeah

3429.119 --> 3433.799
there will be a couple of people that

3431.7 --> 3435.24
will be very lucky to be able to get in

3433.799 --> 3438.599
there and then

3435.24 --> 3440.2799999999997
yeah they would be the win

3438.599 --> 3443.099
at the same time it's going to be a

3440.28 --> 3444.9
cluster [Â __Â ] also free education it's

3443.099 --> 3448.079
everywhere

3444.9 --> 3449.579
scams scams everywhere infiltration

3448.079 --> 3452.2200000000003
corruption

3449.579 --> 3453.299
everywhere

3452.22 --> 3456.4199999999996
yeah

3453.299 --> 3460.28
demons always come and seep in where

3456.42 --> 3460.28
things are free they always do

3478.559 --> 3480.8590000000004
what

3487.859 --> 3493.14
right you know what the solution is

3490.339 --> 3496.2
don't go to freaking College let it

3493.14 --> 3498.24
collapse it's all just rumor based it's

3496.2 --> 3500.64
a scam it's a pyramid scam American

3498.24 --> 3503.0989999999997
college is a pyramid scam

3500.64 --> 3504.42
it's so corrupt it's so polluted the

3503.099 --> 3506.2200000000003
only thing that's

3504.42 --> 3508.26
making it

3506.22 --> 3511.319
keep going is that there's freaking

3508.26 --> 3513.48
movies out there glorifying how great it

3511.319 --> 3516.42
is

3513.48 --> 3518.04
and making people want to go there and

3516.42 --> 3520.38
parents being dumb enough to actually

3518.04 --> 3523.14
green light that because they think

3520.38 --> 3526.04
the movies are real

3523.14 --> 3526.04
and they're wrong

3527.88 --> 3532.92
yeah

3529.74 --> 3537.74
I mean you can get ahead in life

3532.92 --> 3537.7400000000002
if you don't have useless college debt

3541.859 --> 3548.119
you'll get ahead in life because America

3543.78 --> 3548.119
does have a lot of opportunity

3548.28 --> 3555.0
but not so much if you have a giant pile

3550.68 --> 3558.1189999999997
of that and Marxist indoctrination no

3555.0 --> 3561.78
then you're [Â __Â ] so just don't do it

3558.119 --> 3565.799
don't buy into the satanic illusion of

3561.78 --> 3567.78
it it's crap it's just robbing you and

3565.799 --> 3569.94
mutilating you mentally

3567.78 --> 3572.76
you don't learn anything you can learn

3569.94 --> 3574.7400000000002
all that [Â __Â ] by yourself just find the

3572.76 --> 3577.079
right people and hang around listen to

3574.74 --> 3580.2
them I mean just listen to the freaking

3577.079 --> 3583.319
Flat Earth debate and you'll get like

3580.2 --> 3585.24
onto like a third or a half of a

3583.319 --> 3586.38
university education I'm not even

3585.24 --> 3589.0789999999997
kidding

3586.38 --> 3591.059
and that's free you can just listen to

3589.079 --> 3593.7000000000003
it

3591.059 --> 3598.3390000000004
or me just listen to me you know I'm not

3593.7 --> 3598.339
entirely free I need listener support

3600.96 --> 3607.5
right but it's free

3604.559 --> 3610.7400000000002
effectively you can just listen and yeah

3607.5 --> 3615.0
I can't block money from you

3610.74 --> 3617.52
but you can choose to help keep keep me

3615.0 --> 3620.28
going sustain me through voluntary

3617.52 --> 3623.339
donations so that I can give it for free

3620.28 --> 3625.619
so basically what Professor Phil Bell is

3623.339 --> 3627.0
suggesting about free college for

3625.619 --> 3630.059
everybody

3627.0 --> 3632.94
I'm effectively doing that except I'm

3630.059 --> 3635.579
doing that in the new model

3632.94 --> 3637.2000000000003
through the internet

3635.579 --> 3639.6600000000003
I'm here

3637.2 --> 3642.4199999999996
and do what I do I'm open for

3639.66 --> 3644.7
questioning I'm I will explain things

3642.42 --> 3647.4
I will share my Visions I will share my

3644.7 --> 3649.5589999999997
honest internal workings I will share my

3647.4 --> 3652.52
psychological insight I will share

3649.559 --> 3652.52
everything

3653.94 --> 3659.819
and I do it effectively for free but I

3656.579 --> 3662.599
cannot survive for free so that is the

3659.819 --> 3662.599
exchange deal

3680.04 --> 3682.579
hmm

3695.1 --> 3698.2999999999997
[Music]

3703.079 --> 3706.92
you think an employer would value fad

3705.72 --> 3709.14
education

3706.92 --> 3710.7000000000003
I think I don't give a [Â __Â ]

3709.14 --> 3712.5589999999997
yeah

3710.7 --> 3715.319
how about

3712.559 --> 3718.7400000000002
we're gonna learn what we need to learn

3715.319 --> 3721.5
and we're not going to be monopolized by

3718.74 --> 3723.839
some rich fat cat corrupted piece of

3721.5 --> 3726.48
[Â __Â ] out there with a lot of money that

3723.839 --> 3728.22
wants obedient workers maybe they can go

3726.48 --> 3730.92
[Â __Â ] themselves

3728.22 --> 3734.3999999999996
maybe they should get their own courses

3730.92 --> 3736.38
on how to deal with the new age huh

3734.4 --> 3739.319
I think they can probably get a good

3736.38 --> 3741.6600000000003
education for that themselves huh

3739.319 --> 3745.859
so you can adapt instead of trying to

3741.66 --> 3750.0589999999997
turn everybody into mind control slaves

3745.859 --> 3752.7799999999997
for your Undead vessel that poops money

3750.059 --> 3752.78

[Music]

3785.16 --> 3790.0389999999998
no they won't rig back they can't

3793.44 --> 3798.2400000000002
they are already way more dependent on

3796.859 --> 3802.7599999999998
the internet

3798.24 --> 3802.7599999999998
then even we are the General Public

3803.28 --> 3807.78
that can shut it down

3805.72 --> 3810.24
[Music]

3807.78 --> 3812.1600000000003
as long as there's any form of internet

3810.24 --> 3816.0
connection

3812.16 --> 3818.46
there will be Freedom it's impossible

3816.0 --> 3819.299
either you have the internet or you

3818.46 --> 3822.299
don't

3819.299 --> 3824.579
you can't get political control over it

3822.299 --> 3826.38
because people

3824.579 --> 3829.44
dude

3826.38 --> 3832.38
they got like bypassing tools already in

3829.44 --> 3835.099
like hacker communities it's it's so

3832.38 --> 3835.099
basic now

3836.22 --> 3840.8999999999996
you don't you don't even have to be

3838.619 --> 3844.02
afraid of like internet too remember

3840.9 --> 3847.26
that never happened by the way

3844.02 --> 3849.839
you don't even have to be afraid

3847.26 --> 3852.96
because you will find a very basic tool

3849.839 --> 3855.359
probably for free somewhere

3852.96 --> 3857.46
they could just like oh oh we just gonna

3855.359 --> 3859.92
ride that internet and bypass all

3857.46 --> 3861.7200000000003
security it's like it will be as basic

3859.92 --> 3864.2400000000002
as Adblock

3861.72 --> 3865.68
yeah you will be able to ride the

3864.24 --> 3867.5989999999997
internet to

3865.68 --> 3870.24
and nobody will even know that's

3867.599 --> 3872.28
happening except by the extra burden of

3870.24 --> 3874.4399999999996
unregistered activity that they cannot

3872.28 --> 3878.9
Trace yeah

3874.44 --> 3878.9
you have absolutely no chance

3883.67 --> 3893.34

3889.799 --> 3896.599

[Music]

3896.88 --> 3900.96
dude

3898.26 --> 3904.039
you do realize that in this very

3900.96 --> 3904.039
specific period

3904.74 --> 3907.9399999999996
the primary thing

3908.94 --> 3913.559
they do

3910.859 --> 3917.0989999999997
is just Bluff you

3913.559 --> 3917.099
with futuristic

3918.02 --> 3921.92
dystopian science fiction

3922.38 --> 3928.1400000000003

3925.26 --> 3930.539
kneel down to it oh we can't stop it no

3928.14 --> 3933.1189999999997

definitely

now it should absolutely weigh heavily

4338.42 --> 4344.4800000000005
upon them that God hates you

4342.02 --> 4347.6
and that's why you do it

4344.48 --> 4348.5599999999995
yeah hatred of God is the longing for

death

thank you

4380.12 --> 4383.54

4383.54 --> 4389.12
identification about themselves then I

4386.6 --> 4390.8
might even pass on them declaring

4389.12 --> 4392.84
anything about that

4390.8 --> 4395.0
about their fate what they think they

4392.84 --> 4397.52

I'll take but I love Dutch policemen

4810.38 --> 4815.900000000001
right yeah pages in it because this is

4812.96 --> 4818.06
what I think is the policy in England is

4815.9 --> 4820.638999999999
just different so

4818.06 --> 4824.139
they didn't just hire police they also

4820.639 --> 4826.400000000001
basically hired public

4824.139 --> 4829.46
suppressing agents

4826.4 --> 4834.08
people that are cops just

4829.46 --> 4837.88
that'll just do whatever they're told

4834.08 --> 4837.88

as usual

4903.679 --> 4905.92
foreign

4931.239 --> 4936.739
what if they just did the internment

4934.1 --> 4939.400000000001
ship at an engineer

4936.739 --> 4942.919999999999
and then they didn't go to university

4939.4 --> 4944.54
and they just got a couple of books that

4942.92 --> 4946.219
they need to learn and they could do

4944.54 --> 4950.48
that at home

4946.219 --> 4952.219
maybe have like a chat Forum where they

4950.48 --> 4953.839999999999
can connect with other people that know

4952.219 --> 4956.659
about these things and or that are

4953.84 --> 4958.88
learning about it themselves and

4956.659 --> 4961.339999999999
so they could ask a question about it if

4958.88 --> 4965.0
they needed to how about that Professor

4961.34 --> 4967.76
Phil Bill how about they just don't

4965.0 --> 4969.86
go to the university

4967.76 --> 4974.4800000000005
Early College

4969.86 --> 4977.299999999999
and they just go into apprenticeship

4974.48 --> 4979.699
by the way which is a very popular even

4977.3 --> 4981.02
official model here in the Netherlands

4979.699 --> 4982.82
as well

4981.02 --> 4985.88
there's a lot of studies that do it like

4982.82 --> 4988.96
that and all kinds of fields why because

4985.88 --> 4988.96
they really work

4991.4 --> 4997.04
why are you so scared of Education no

4993.98 --> 4999.5
I'm just saying it you don't need it

4997.04 --> 5001.96
professor philbas already saying Lee's

4999.5 --> 5005.86
literally saying it right there

5001.96 --> 5007.3
I insist that they do internships at

5005.86 --> 5010.599999999999
engineers

5007.3 --> 5012.639
or consultant firms whatever

5010.6 --> 5014.7390000000005
why would that be

5012.639 --> 5017.08
maybe because that's where you actually

5014.739 --> 5019.9
learn what you really need to learn a

5017.08 --> 5023.32
skill a profession

5019.9 --> 5026.5599999999995
so why not just do that then and Skip

5023.32 --> 5028.0599999999995
all the nonsense

5026.56 --> 5031.2390000000005

5028.06 --> 5034.06
and giant amounts of money

5031.239 --> 5035.919999999999
just do that

5034.06 --> 5039.4800000000005
what do we think about Sovereign

5035.92 --> 5039.4800000000005
citizens I think that uh

5041.26 --> 5046.54
I don't know

5043.96 --> 5048.76
I think that Sovereign citizens is a

5046.54 --> 5052.84
contradiction in terms

5048.76 --> 5055.54
Sovereign is basically a king a ruler a

5052.84 --> 5057.88
citizen is a Slave

5055.54 --> 5060.78
that's the origin of the word it's a

5057.88 --> 5060.78
slave to this day

5061.0 --> 5066.34
yeah that's why they use that word in

5063.04 --> 5069.28
very specific sci-fi books

5066.34 --> 5072.04
they don't just use another type of

5069.28 --> 5075.9
description yeah so Sovereign citizens

5072.04 --> 5075.9
is his contradiction in terms

5077.44 --> 5080.28
it can't be both

5081.04 --> 5084.84
I don't know if you are aware of that

5098.02 --> 5102.820000000001
the learning curve would be too Steep

5100.84 --> 5104.8
and the firms one basic skills to begin

5102.82 --> 5106.599999999999
with

5104.8 --> 5111.34
well

5106.6 --> 5114.52
then why don't they just have a guy a

5111.34 --> 5116.4400000000005
guy that gives them the intro course

5114.52 --> 5119.5
yeah why do you need to go to college

5116.44 --> 5121.719
you could just they

5119.5 --> 5125.56
the the corporation

5121.719 --> 5127.36
uh groups again all the organization of

5125.56 --> 5131.6990000000005
a certain type of profession they could

5127.36 --> 5135.4
literally just have their intro courses

5131.699 --> 5137.739
exactly tuned to what the company needs

5135.4 --> 5141.099999999999
in the company would basically organize

5137.739 --> 5143.62
this also happens out there a lot

5141.1 --> 5146.56
just like oh job oh you need this basic

5143.62 --> 5148.48
skills like need discourse

5146.56 --> 5150.580000000001
you might have to pay a little fee for

5148.48 --> 5153.099999999999
that but you'll make it back when you

5150.58 --> 5155.62
get into into the job

5153.1 --> 5159.52
right it's already happening like why do

5155.62 --> 5161.8
you need a college or a university

5159.52 --> 5163.540000000001
when the company can literally teach you

5161.8 --> 5167.219
the basic skills that they need you to

5163.54 --> 5167.219
have this is all ridiculous

5196.719 --> 5202.78
I'm just just saying like really what I

5200.98 --> 5205.12
talked about today about schools being

5202.78 --> 5207.159
outdated that it can be a new

5205.12 --> 5209.199
decentralized system that's a really

5207.159 --> 5211.0599999999995
serious thing I'm talking about that is

5209.199 --> 5213.04
really for the future

5211.06 --> 5216.280000000001
there's other people out there that have

5213.04 --> 5219.04
also like for example Ron Paul really

5216.28 --> 5222.099999999999
tried to do something like this

5219.04 --> 5224.199
he's he's got like a big homeschooling

5222.1 --> 5228.820000000001
system and all that

5224.199 --> 5231.5199999999995
that is really in line with this idea

5228.82 --> 5235.5
brilliant

5231.52 --> 5235.5
and effective and cheap

5236.86 --> 5241.719
so every time Phil Bella is trying to

5239.86 --> 5244.36
defend why people should go to the

5241.719 --> 5247.659
university or the college I could just

5244.36 --> 5250.36
immediately lay out exactly how it

5247.659 --> 5253.839999999999
wouldn't be necessary for that not to

5250.36 --> 5255.88
like you you stupid you bad University

5253.84 --> 5258.88
or college it's just like no actually

5255.88 --> 5260.08
technically in unnecessary and it's

5258.88 --> 5263.28
already being done out there it's

5260.08 --> 5263.28
already being bypassed

5265.719 --> 5270.1
you need University well that's the old

5268.9 --> 5273.12
myth

5270.1 --> 5277.06
that's that's like an industrial era

5273.12 --> 5279.82
myth Ares 106.

5277.06 --> 5281.320000000001
and used to be the case absolutely when

5279.82 --> 5283.42
it was still

5281.32 --> 5287.32
really viable

5283.42 --> 5290.02
and pure and uncorrupted and infiltrated

5287.32 --> 5292.48
by Marxist that one that wanted program

5290.02 --> 5294.280000000001
people to hate their own country

5292.48 --> 5296.799999999999
yeah

5294.28 --> 5299.219
it used to be like that it's not anymore

5296.8 --> 5299.219
though

5303.94 --> 5311.32
you need University to become a

5306.84 --> 5315.04
literally well-rounded a fat

5311.32 --> 5318.179
mentally deranged idiot

5315.04 --> 5318.179
with a lot of debt

5322.3 --> 5328.7390000000005
[Music]

5340.36 --> 5344.739
I need an entire new system who benefits

5342.4 --> 5347.679
the people right well

5344.739 --> 5349.12
yeah that's that's what I was talking

5347.679 --> 5351.52
about

5349.12 --> 5352.54
but it's D it has to be decentralized

5351.52 --> 5357.0
though

5352.54 --> 5357.0
get the real Freedom back

5362.77 --> 5370.959000000001
[Music]

5372.719 --> 5378.76
no no no I'm not running down University

5375.82 --> 5381.36
just pointing at facts registerable

5378.76 --> 5381.360000000001
facts

5382.6 --> 5385.38
foreign

5397.36 --> 5404.38
the fact remains is that University are

5401.02 --> 5407.1990000000005
unbelievably expensive

5404.38 --> 5410.1990000000005
and that there is provably

5407.199 --> 5412.839999999999
like broad going on

5410.199 --> 5415.839999999999
it's like budgets and [Â __Â ] and and

5412.84 --> 5419.4400000000005
that's dude

5415.84 --> 5422.02
I mean that's been kind of known for a

5419.44 --> 5424.239
while now I mean there is corruption

5422.02 --> 5426.46
it's outdated it's technically outdated

5424.239 --> 5429.28
you don't need it anymore it was good

5426.46 --> 5433.12
while it lasted

5429.28 --> 5436.199
well except for like the last

5433.12 --> 5436.199
20 30 years

5444.52 --> 5450.0
maybe less I don't know

5447.82 --> 5450.0

5539.02 --> 5542.38
hmm

5540.04 --> 5544.6
cool George Sanford yeah I thought

5542.38 --> 5546.78
something like that it would be like

5544.6 --> 5546.780000000001
that

5547.9 --> 5553.239
yeah I'm enjoying the chat right now

5550.48 --> 5556.259999999999
just sometimes I just need to read what

5553.239 --> 5556.259999999999
you guys are talking about

5557.98 --> 5561.339999999999
I have to think I've already pretty much

5559.48 --> 5563.259999999999
said anything

5561.34 --> 5566.38
about the subject that I could think of

5563.26 --> 5569.52
[Music]

5566.38 --> 5569.52
it's been interesting though

5575.08 --> 5579.46
hmm

5576.82 --> 5580.9
direct democracy wow that's something

5579.46 --> 5582.82
that I

5580.9 --> 5585.099999999999
haven't heard in a while

5582.82 --> 5587.639
that description

5585.1 --> 5587.639
hmm

5620.38 --> 5624.58
yeah

5621.58 --> 5629.32
yes PJ Cena totally agree

5624.58 --> 5633.159
you know it might arguably even be

5629.32 --> 5635.259999999999
that you should like not try to learn

5633.159 --> 5638.679
everything in advance

5635.26 --> 5639.58
and just actually do what is done and

5638.679 --> 5641.02
then

5639.58 --> 5642.639
perhaps

5641.02 --> 5644.56
study it

5642.639 --> 5647.32
to like get the details perfect

5644.56 --> 5649.4800000000005
afterward after you got the routines

5647.32 --> 5652.0599999999995
right because the Practical knowledge is

5649.48 --> 5655.919999999999
really the most important

5652.06 --> 5655.92
most of the time it's just

5656.56 --> 5663.46
and maybe even some weird

5661.12 --> 5665.86
things that that you learn might just be

5663.46 --> 5667.2390000000005
incorrect or hyper theoretical and it

5665.86 --> 5670.259999999999
doesn't really apply and then it would

5667.239 --> 5670.259999999999
only be distracting

5671.98 --> 5676.178999999999
right so maybe

5674.08 --> 5680.38
you should actually learn the practice

5676.179 --> 5683.08
first and then the theory

5680.38 --> 5685.78
right first just see if this is

5683.08 --> 5688.119
something that you can do and that you

5685.78 --> 5690.699
feel comfortable doing

5688.119 --> 5692.38
and then if it's like yeah I like this

5690.699 --> 5694.0
then learn everything about it because

5692.38 --> 5695.56
then you also have the confidence like

5694.0 --> 5696.639
hey this is actually something I want to

5695.56 --> 5700.139
do

5696.639 --> 5700.139
doesn't that make a lot more sense

5711.41 --> 5714.6089999999995
[Music]

5754.98 --> 5759.299999999999
okay there sent you will go

5759.52 --> 5763.56
corpse eaters get hurt

5764.38 --> 5768.9400000000005
I that's that sounds like a straw man

5766.9 --> 5772.739
though I mean eating meat definitely

5768.94 --> 5772.739
does not give you a heart attacks

5773.739 --> 5780.54
it's if it's polluted

5776.679 --> 5780.54
meat can be polluted

5780.699 --> 5786.879999999999
also yeah if you eat too much of it oh

5784.96 --> 5789.639
well I can't even say that I mean

5786.88 --> 5792.34
there's meatarians out there but they

5789.639 --> 5793.84
their hearts are actually quite great

5792.34 --> 5797.08
so

5793.84 --> 5800.139
it's usually just the poison or God

5797.08 --> 5802.719
forbid injected poison that will lead to

5800.139 --> 5805.3
heart attacks

5802.719 --> 5809.04
okay it's not eating meat that's a total

5805.3 --> 5809.04
straw man sensual goat

5810.04 --> 5816.1
and it's a vegan yeah there are things

5812.679 --> 5818.679
you can definitely worry about

5816.1 --> 5821.4400000000005
no it's not the essential go there's

5818.679 --> 5824.82
people that eat raw meat

5821.44 --> 5824.82
and their hearts are great

5826.48 --> 5830.32
I'm not kidding

5828.04 --> 5833.139
that's real

5830.32 --> 5834.82
so it's just not true

5833.139 --> 5837.659000000001
don't know where you got that from it's

5834.82 --> 5837.659
just not true

5839.67 --> 5842.84
[Music]

5842.98 --> 5848.44
but yeah what kind of meat is it

5845.5 --> 5851.02
what was the condition of the animal was

5848.44 --> 5852.4
it organic fat organic bread

5851.02 --> 5856.540000000001
right

5852.4 --> 5857.98
or the highly toxic General masses type

5856.54 --> 5860.38
of meat

5857.98 --> 5862.419999999999
basically it tortures existence yeah

5860.38 --> 5864.34
that's gonna be extremely [Â __Â ] up for

5862.42 --> 5867.04
you especially your heart not because

5864.34 --> 5869.26
it's meat it's because

5867.04 --> 5872.5
energy

5869.26 --> 5873.52
and just what's been going on in that

5872.5 --> 5875.679
meat

5873.52 --> 5877.860000000001
that you're gonna assimilate that's the

5875.679 --> 5877.86
problem

5880.78 --> 5887.94
meat does not give you heart attacks

5884.98 --> 5887.94
it's just not true

what the [Â __Â ] where the hell are you

5894.82 --> 5897.54

5926.92 --> 5932.38
really

5928.42 --> 5934.84
how many people were in that study

5932.38 --> 5937.78
how many people said she'll go how many

5934.84 --> 5939.76
people actually did he pick out

5937.78 --> 5942.82
and what were their diets like where

5939.76 --> 5946.780000000001
they're all healthy organic diets and

5942.82 --> 5949.9
then you take one organic meat diet and

5946.78 --> 5951.759999999999
organic vegan diet now that would be an

5949.9 --> 5953.879999999999
honest test I don't think that's part of

5951.76 --> 5953.88
it

do you think they learn that how do you

6033.06 --> 6040.8
think by being present at an operation

6036.78 --> 6044.219
yeah it's actually being there

6040.8 --> 6045.360000000001
that's how they learn not through a pile

6044.219 --> 6048.179
of books

6045.36 --> 6051.739
like are are you making my argument now

that and then oh if you look if you're

6118.92 --> 6124.92
gonna make animals your Jews to defend

6196.8 --> 6203.159000000001
University

6199.8 --> 6205.9800000000005
no the advancements come from the actual

6203.159 --> 6208.199
in the field practice it comes from

6205.98 --> 6210.119
surgeons figuring it out it comes from

6208.199 --> 6213.659
them getting together

6210.119 --> 6214.92
with like update consoles they do that I

6213.659 --> 6217.98
know because

6214.92 --> 6221.04
like dentists also do that my ex used to

6217.98 --> 6221.94
do that but is you do that like all year

6221.04 --> 6223.92
long

6221.94 --> 6226.08
you have to go to groups and just geek

6223.92 --> 6229.32
stay updated stay updated and talk and

6226.08 --> 6231.54
talk share your findings

6229.32 --> 6233.4
compare notes

6231.54 --> 6236.0
they do that that's where they get the

6233.4 --> 6240.299999999999
advancements from

6236.0 --> 6242.34
the university yeah the university next

6240.3 --> 6245.58
in the hospital

6242.34 --> 6248.34
sure but that's really just for yeah for

6245.58 --> 6250.5599999999995
practical study then

6248.34 --> 6253.56
it's just

6250.56 --> 6255.3
for students to get fuel experience so

6253.56 --> 6257.84
it's like

6255.3 --> 6257.84
yeah

6257.94 --> 6263.46
that is almost like an apprenticeship

6259.98 --> 6266.82
system on its own like University is

6263.46 --> 6268.92
literally merged with the hospital I

6266.82 --> 6271.08
mean that is just like an apprenticeship

6268.92 --> 6273.42
system that's not not really a standard

6271.08 --> 6276.98
university even

6273.42 --> 6276.9800000000005
very effective by the way

6279.9 --> 6282.86
overall

6292.56 --> 6298.280000000001
yeah

6294.36 --> 6298.28
and then there's that George Sanford

6352.32 --> 6358.139
what and it literally can't scroll and

6355.98 --> 6360.0599999999995
see anything I type what

6358.139 --> 6361.679
okay

6360.06 --> 6363.900000000001
that's annoying

6361.679 --> 6365.639
oh you might look if the scroll option

6363.9 --> 6368.339999999999
is suddenly gone it happens to me too

6365.639 --> 6369.42
sometimes just refresh the page it's a

6368.34 --> 6371.88
glitch

6369.42 --> 6374.34
it happens rarely but sometimes it does

6371.88 --> 6378.02
and then you just have to refresh

6374.34 --> 6378.02
and then it's back usually

6378.42 --> 6385.34
I'm on mobile yeah should be the same

6382.199 --> 6388.619
or really does it not have a scroll

6385.34 --> 6391.219
option for the chat

6388.619 --> 6391.219
what

6391.92 --> 6394.58
huh

6423.42 --> 6427.92
yeah and by the way seeking star what is

6425.76 --> 6430.08
what you said earlier yeah

6427.92 --> 6431.82
you can't look the animal in the eyes

6430.08 --> 6435.98
and kill it yourself you shouldn't eat

6431.82 --> 6435.98
them that is a fair statement to make

[Music]

6468.42 --> 6473.36
all right fair enough so you can start

6470.159 --> 6473.36
water fair enough

6474.36 --> 6478.08
weirdly enough I did actually kill a

6477.179 --> 6480.4800000000005
fish

6478.08 --> 6483.0599999999995
but since then I've refused to ever eat

6480.48 --> 6486.379999999999
fish I do take fish oil though

6483.06 --> 6486.38
isn't that just odd

6488.219 --> 6492.659
don't think I've ever like killed a

6490.56 --> 6494.46
chicken or anything but if I did then I

6492.659 --> 6497.9
don't remember and it probably was very

6494.46 --> 6497.9
traumatized by it at the time

6498.239 --> 6501.619
I did I don't remember

6513.34 --> 6516.399
[Music]

6520.139 --> 6523.219
oh yeah

6544.08 --> 6548.119
dude fish oil is good for everything

6553.44 --> 6556.04
hmm

6558.02 --> 6562.8
interesting

6559.8 --> 6562.8
virus

6566.52 --> 6570.38
the fisherman team

6580.26 --> 6584.84
what what are you talking about FES

6585.119 --> 6590.659
what

6587.159 --> 6590.659
what are you talking about Derek

6606.06 --> 6608.780000000001
hmm

6653.3 --> 6658.4400000000005
you oh your I your eye doctor prescribed

6656.58 --> 6663.139
you fish oil

6658.44 --> 6663.138999999999
that's an awesome eye doctor I like that

6667.08 --> 6670.32
not that I need one but

6668.99 --> 6673.32
[Music]

6670.32 --> 6676.5199999999995
I got great eyes I hope to keep them

6673.32 --> 6676.5199999999995
forever like this

6683.52 --> 6687.659000000001
but yeah that's awesome

6685.5 --> 6690.599
I mean any doctor that will prescribe

6687.659 --> 6692.339999999999
you fish oil for whatever reason is a

6690.599 --> 6695.639
good doctor in my book

6692.34 --> 6698.9400000000005
yes like if they bring it as an advice

6695.639 --> 6701.6990000000005
that's immediate like oh yeah that's

6698.94 --> 6705.54
always going to be good

6701.699 --> 6708.0
good eyes are Priceless uh yeah

6705.54 --> 6709.8
very very happy with my eyes they are

6708.0 --> 6713.36
great and the funny thing is they're

6709.8 --> 6713.360000000001
better than my parents eyes

6713.94 --> 6719.0
that's

6715.56 --> 6719.0
like the weird part

6721.86 --> 6727.5
like both my parents had glasses

6725.099 --> 6729.84
like reading glasses and [Â __Â ] and that

6727.5 --> 6731.699
started even like

6729.84 --> 6734.76
is it

6731.699 --> 6738.98
in their 40s I think

6734.76 --> 6738.9800000000005
nothing nothing whatsoever

6739.5 --> 6743.94
I got great eyes but sometimes I got a

6742.44 --> 6746.159
bit of focus issues but it has nothing

6743.94 --> 6748.32
to do with like my quality of my eyes it

6746.159 --> 6750.42
has to do with basically my brain trying

6748.32 --> 6752.9
to

6750.42 --> 6755.58
yeah Focus

6752.9 --> 6758.219
just sometimes I get a bit blurry vision

6755.58 --> 6760.139
or something but that's it's all about

6758.219 --> 6762.54
Focus

6760.139 --> 6765.02
as soon as they focus it's just it's

6762.54 --> 6765.0199999999995
crisp

6796.56 --> 6801.92
what do you mean you're meant to wear

6798.599 --> 6801.92
glasses we just seen it

6802.32 --> 6807.119
you mean a eye doctor has advised it to

6805.26 --> 6811.02
you for some reason

6807.119 --> 6814.86
to death I've been to eye doctors to do

6811.02 --> 6816.780000000001
tests but I have incredible sharpness of

6814.86 --> 6819.659
you

6816.78 --> 6821.78
especially if I smoke like a joint right

6819.659 --> 6824.58
before I do that test

6821.78 --> 6828.48
and I used it

6824.58 --> 6830.659
like cannabis makes my eyes better it

6828.48 --> 6830.659
does

6840.0 --> 6847.52
or I think it probably helps the part of

6843.48 --> 6847.5199999999995
the brain that actually manages the site

6853.38 --> 6859.4400000000005
find it hard to read small print

6856.38 --> 6861.2390000000005
yeah okay fair enough but that's

6859.44 --> 6863.82
freaking small print dude if they're a

6861.239 --> 6867.799999999999
small print you know what I do

6863.82 --> 6867.799999999999
see it's like [Â __Â ] glasses

6869.699 --> 6872.36
just

6873.06 --> 6876.1990000000005
use this

6877.139 --> 6880.619
right

6878.4 --> 6884.58
like who needs glasses with this you can

6880.619 --> 6888.139
read anything no matter how small

6884.58 --> 6888.139
it's so incredibly

6888.239 --> 6892.919999999999
yeah this is this is like for for Gems

6891.48 --> 6895.739
and Jewelry

6892.92 --> 6899.219
because as a jeweler you have to read

6895.739 --> 6901.0199999999995
like codes that are like really small

6899.219 --> 6903.9
that are embedded

6901.02 --> 6906.119000000001
in in jewelry

6903.9 --> 6908.638999999999
and yeah then you need a thing like this

6906.119 --> 6911.9
like that's all you need I carry this

6908.639 --> 6911.900000000001
with me with my back

6912.42 --> 6915.679
I rarely need it

6917.46 --> 6921.26
use it for my country right

6919.619 --> 6924.86
because they're great they're so small

6921.26 --> 6924.860000000001
it's so basic

6926.639 --> 6930.4800000000005
I mean who needs glasses I mean you can

6929.46 --> 6933.32
just

6930.48 --> 6933.32
use that

6933.9 --> 6939.0199999999995
all right if you wear glasses your eyes

6936.179 --> 6939.02
become lazy

6939.599 --> 6943.46
is that a jewelry Loop yes

6944.639 --> 6950.58
remember I'm a Goldsmith like I made all

6947.82 --> 6953.54

6950.58 --> 6953.54

6999.48 --> 7002.0199999999995

7004.58 --> 7011.0
