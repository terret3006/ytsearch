raining through out tonight it's like

122.759 --> 128.52
everything is still very moist out

127.23 --> 132.31900000000002
[Music]

128.52 --> 136.8
there seems to be very low

132.319 --> 136.79999999999998
wind today for some

142.04 --> 146.04
reason right

152.28 --> 156.12
all

153.0 --> 158.319
right BL Flat Earth Sage first in chat

156.12 --> 164.08
good to see

158.319 --> 164.07999999999998
you it is Tuesday the 18th of June

168.959 --> 177.2
2024 temperature is 18° C 70%

174.08 --> 181.20000000000002
precipitation 78%

177.2 --> 181.2
humidity okay

185.92 --> 191.64
weather could be better but it sounds

188.92 --> 194.2
like at least today the yeah the guy

191.64 --> 197.23899999999998
over there is not going to

194.2 --> 199.599
be drilling or sawing or whatever the

197.239 --> 203.48000000000002
hell he was doing yesterday seems like

199.599 --> 208.959
he's not doing that today so that's

203.48 --> 208.959
something hello borders boy good see you

212.89 --> 215.95
[Applause]

223.239 --> 225.64000000000001
how you

226.2 --> 230.48
doing this Tuesday

240.64 --> 244.48
the yesterday show went pretty

260.199 --> 266.639
well let's see what the Today's Show is

263.16 --> 266.639
going to be like

298.639 --> 302.68
oh for

341.88 --> 349.4
I'm just looking around let's to see

345.039 --> 349.4
like what's going on out there

388.16 --> 391.16
h

393.28 --> 395.919
low moon

398.759 --> 406.16
rover wit it and jarus and going to

402.0 --> 406.16
Antarctica well we'll see about

408.0 --> 414.84
that if the sun sets it's the end of the

412.08 --> 419.68
globe narrative all

414.84 --> 423.0
stuff maybe maybe moon rover or they

419.68 --> 425.56
just have to figure out something new as

423.0 --> 425.56
they always

426.039 --> 430.87899999999996
do on the other hand maybe it won't

430.919 --> 434.28
happen I don't

447.72 --> 452.72
know good one yeserday today yeah thanks

450.28 --> 452.71999999999997
but

458.08 --> 464.96
Sage I noticed that you were chatting in

460.919 --> 469.52
the Skype chat a lot I did not follow

464.96 --> 469.52
it the conversation you had

475.0 --> 481.479
but they would need permission just to

478.12 --> 485.24
be there right well I'm going to take it

481.479 --> 485.24
that they will get that

487.8 --> 494.479
permission would be kind of pointless to

490.319 --> 494.47900000000004
try to go there if they didn't

535.76 --> 538.76
h

542.88 --> 547.64
wonder where they're going on Antarctica

545.48 --> 550.72
well probably on

547.64 --> 554.24
the the typical location where people

550.72 --> 554.24
are allowed to

567.44 --> 572.5600000000001
visit right so any

570.279 --> 574.4399999999999
any indications as to when that's

572.56 --> 578.5189999999999
supposed to

574.44 --> 578.519
happen when are they going to go

585.76 --> 591.279
there December okay hello

589.55 --> 595.279
[Music]

591.279 --> 595.279
or right

616.48 --> 622.64
the final experiment one to prove flat

618.76 --> 622.64
or Globe well it'll

623.76 --> 632.0
prove well not to be fair it would prove

627.92 --> 635.36
something it it would prove that oh my

632.0 --> 635.36
are you [ __ ] kidding

636.14 --> 639.25
[Music]

648.11 --> 653.519
[Music]

650.44 --> 656.5600000000001
me right so it won't necessarily prove

653.519 --> 659.36
the Earth to be flat but it it will

656.56 --> 661.7199999999999
prove like the heliocentric claims wrong

659.36 --> 661.72
all

663.399 --> 666.92
right that's about

676.839 --> 683.2790000000001
it December will end the globe narrative

680.48 --> 687.399
well good luck for that I mean I don't

683.279 --> 687.399
think that's ever going to happen

710.21 --> 713.289
[Music]

714.04 --> 721.24
right anyway I got some turmeric coffee

718.24 --> 721.24
here

722.44 --> 727.4000000000001
[Music]

748.16 --> 751.16
for

778.12 --> 782.16
e e

816.16 --> 820.36
huh how did I get muted that was

823.6 --> 828.6800000000001
weird right thanks for telling me so

826.32 --> 833.0790000000001
quickly or

828.68 --> 833.079
Noble that was weird

840.399 --> 845.279
ruins in the

843.0 --> 849.24
interior

845.279 --> 849.24
uh maybe

849.48 --> 854.36
probably but I mean there's like a ton

851.92 --> 857.88
of ice in between

854.36 --> 859.44
so unless you're like going to dig down

857.88 --> 863.4399999999999
or

859.44 --> 863.44
something you're not going to find

863.48 --> 867.1990000000001
anything hello Shan

868.04 --> 872.079
G for

901.6 --> 904.839
I really hope the weather's turning

903.279 --> 909.56
going to turn around I was just getting

904.839 --> 909.5600000000001
used to yesterday the nice sunny

909.639 --> 913.6800000000001
weather because it was a really nice day

912.36 --> 917.1990000000001
overall

913.68 --> 919.5899999999999
yesterday I want it back I want more of

917.199 --> 922.779
that

919.59 --> 922.779
[Music]

943.6 --> 948.26
h

945.17 --> 948.26
[Music]

969.88 --> 975.12
on every continent there's some sort of

971.8 --> 975.12
ruins yeah no but there

976.279 --> 982.48
are it would be kind of interesting to

979.04 --> 985.16
like cross reference though to see like

982.48 --> 988.24
if they're going to find any kind of

985.16 --> 990.199
ancient architecture underneath the ice

988.24 --> 994.04
like

990.199 --> 997.3599999999999
from what time period that would roughly

994.04 --> 1002.48
be or just by comparing the style of it

997.36 --> 1002.48
to other places like is that going to

1002.959 --> 1009.399
be

1005.72 --> 1009.399
uh I forgot the

1011.16 --> 1014.16
name

1016.8 --> 1021.88
uh well it's just overall what kind of

1019.48 --> 1026.48
style is it going to be like uh

1021.88 --> 1028.48
that Inca location in Chile on the

1026.48 --> 1030.679
mountain with like the rocks that are

1028.48 --> 1034.319
just like perfectly

1030.679 --> 1036.3600000000001
seamed like weird asymmetrical rocks but

1034.319 --> 1038.9189999999999
that are like perfectly seamless

1036.36 --> 1042.36
together is it going to be that style or

1038.919 --> 1042.3600000000001
is it going to be more modern

1042.48 --> 1047.28
even like some of the giant buildings

1045.76 --> 1048.919
that that are just in the middle of

1047.28 --> 1052.8799999999999
cities everywhere is going to be

1048.919 --> 1055.24
something like that like cuz you could

1052.88 --> 1057.48
argue that those are from different time

1055.24 --> 1060.919
periods

1057.48 --> 1062.919
so yeah what what's the style of what

1060.919 --> 1066.16
they were going to find that would be

1062.919 --> 1066.16
very telling

1079.08 --> 1082.72
there through miles of ice yeah yeah

1080.88 --> 1084.64
yeah yeah that's the pro that's the

1082.72 --> 1086.96
problem isn't

1084.64 --> 1089.5200000000002
it I mean that's what going to be one

1086.96 --> 1089.52
hell of a

1094.559 --> 1101.28
project then you might up in a similar

1097.28 --> 1104.72
scenario as Alien versus Predator the

1101.28 --> 1104.72
movie the first

1107.36 --> 1114.4799999999998
one although I doubt that you're

1110.28 --> 1114.48
actually going to bump into aliens

1132.08 --> 1139.0
there I'm sorry I'm I'm cold I'm going

1135.24 --> 1139.0
to put on my sweater

1140.159 --> 1146.8400000000001
it's just too cold to sit here in my

1143.64 --> 1146.8400000000001
t-shirt hold

1167.72 --> 1171.679
on for

1213.96 --> 1218.159
right so this is better

1237.08 --> 1241.039
right but yeah I agree flatter Sage I

1239.08 --> 1242.9189999999999
mean it would be very interesting to

1241.039 --> 1246.6
have some excavations happen in

1242.919 --> 1250.159
Antarctica and all that but uh I don't

1246.6 --> 1250.1589999999999
see that happening anytime

1252.12 --> 1259.52
soon maybe

1255.64 --> 1262.24
ever but yeah I get it I mean they made

1259.52 --> 1265.08
movies about that stuff like as an

1262.24 --> 1270.559
inspiration like oh they found

1265.08 --> 1270.559
something with many different movies so

1313.679 --> 1318.039
right but I

1314.799 --> 1319.48
mean real exploration May simply just be

1318.039 --> 1322.12
off

1319.48 --> 1323.52
limits because there's a good chance

1322.12 --> 1327.6
that there's

1323.52 --> 1329.32
a another civilization there somewhere

1327.6 --> 1332.52
at

1329.32 --> 1336.96
Antarctica and they

1332.52 --> 1339.679
just they just consider that place as

1336.96 --> 1344.159
their territory and if you wander in too

1339.679 --> 1344.159
far they just take you out

1357.2 --> 1362.2
after the treaty is no invoid what are

1359.679 --> 1362.2
you talking

1362.6 --> 1370.6399999999999
about you mean the Antartica

1366.279 --> 1370.64
treaty is that going to run out of

1373.799 --> 1378.96
time I I wasn't aware of that

1385.1 --> 1388.23
[Music]

1392.52 --> 1396.709
2038

1393.66 --> 1396.709
[Music]

1397.08 --> 1401.24
H

1398.679 --> 1404.76
right so I guess that's going to be an

1401.24 --> 1408.64
issue for after this entire situation is

1404.76 --> 1408.64
rounded out then

1413.4 --> 1421.039
I mean if we can all make it past it

1416.72 --> 1425.1200000000001
2030s then yeah then maybe after that

1421.039 --> 1425.12
point it would be time to explore

1425.2 --> 1429.76
Antarctica I have to survive through

1427.44 --> 1429.76
this

1436.279 --> 1441.12
first 2040

1438.799 --> 1441.12
oh

1463.2 --> 1469.24
okay I think it's possible they

1465.679 --> 1474.3990000000001
discovered dude I mean

1469.24 --> 1474.3990000000001
think I bet they discover tons of things

1476.919 --> 1484.2
there and it's all just off the record I

1480.44 --> 1484.2
mean it's a very big

1488.32 --> 1492.32
continent you don't care if you're 90

1490.76 --> 1494.8799999999999
years old oh

1492.32 --> 1498.799
okay well by the time you're 90 years

1494.88 --> 1498.7990000000002
old you might care

1512.12 --> 1517.1999999999998
and besides by that

1514.159 --> 1520.44
time it might just be a lot easier for

1517.2 --> 1522.919
especially an old person to just like

1520.44 --> 1527.3200000000002
send somebody there with

1522.919 --> 1529.919
the full on 3D live

1527.32 --> 1533.32
camera and then just watch them through

1529.919 --> 1533.3200000000002
your virtual reality

1534.0 --> 1542.919
helmet from your yeah from your place of

1538.48 --> 1546.159
origin and just check it all out that

1542.919 --> 1551.159
way I mean why would you really

1546.159 --> 1551.159
physically have to go there right

1564.399 --> 1568.6789999999999
I mean by that time you could literally

1566.44 --> 1571.44
send just the scanning

1568.679 --> 1573.1200000000001
drone like oh we found a location okay

1571.44 --> 1574.6000000000001
sending the Drone it's going to scan

1573.12 --> 1579.7199999999998
everything and then it's just going to

1574.6 --> 1583.1999999999998
be a 3D map made of

1579.72 --> 1584.84
that that you could just like emulate in

1583.2 --> 1588.64
a

1584.84 --> 1591.12
computer just have that entire

1588.64 --> 1593.64
surrounding just perfectly reconstructed

1591.12 --> 1597.9189999999999
for you to have a 3D model of it and

1593.64 --> 1597.919
just move about within it

1599.59 --> 1602.8899999999999
[Music]

1619.48 --> 1623.919
during the exploration dump your body

1621.76 --> 1627.48
some okay I didn't know that you had

1623.919 --> 1632.3200000000002
this strong Longing To Die an old man in

1627.48 --> 1632.32
Antarctica but uh

1644.679 --> 1651.1200000000001
okay but you know what I would like as

1647.52 --> 1655.0
an alternative it's going to sound

1651.12 --> 1659.32
weird I would like my bones to be used

1655.0 --> 1662.88
in a catacomb to empower an ancient

1659.32 --> 1662.8799999999999
structure that's what I

1664.2 --> 1671.519
want I mean can you imagine that your

1667.88 --> 1674.0390000000002
body could literally be having some kind

1671.519 --> 1680.1200000000001
of function after

1674.039 --> 1680.12
death isn't that an amazing idea

1682.279 --> 1688.279
and I was thinking about the catacomb

1685.039 --> 1690.32
situation that's supposedly everywhere I

1688.279 --> 1693.519
think that it might simply have been

1690.32 --> 1693.519
like a

1694.799 --> 1698.96
tradition like with what I'm just going

1697.12 --> 1701.9599999999998
to call the

1698.96 --> 1701.96
tartarians

1702.919 --> 1707.919
that they wouldn't have Graves or

1705.72 --> 1711.0
whatever or maybe they did and then

1707.919 --> 1714.0800000000002
after after a while after it would lay

1711.0 --> 1716.559
there for a certain period and most of

1714.08 --> 1719.1999999999998
it rotten whatever that they would dig

1716.559 --> 1721.279
it up and just like take the bones and

1719.2 --> 1723.64
put it in a

1721.279 --> 1727.2
catacomb as a

1723.64 --> 1730.039
function I mean that sounds incredibly

1727.2 --> 1733.1200000000001
efficient like empty

1730.039 --> 1738.1589999999999
sounds yeah whatever you empty the grave

1733.12 --> 1743.84
of of the skeletons and then you

1738.159 --> 1743.8400000000001
put them in a catacomb to power a

1744.159 --> 1751.7600000000002
building and I'm wondering

1746.679 --> 1755.5590000000002
like has the Catholic Church been doing

1751.76 --> 1758.36
this over the ages have they been also

1755.559 --> 1760.1589999999999
part of this or are all

1758.36 --> 1762.7199999999998
those

1760.159 --> 1765.279
skeletons that are in the catacombs

1762.72 --> 1768.919
exclusively from

1765.279 --> 1772.159
like the previous civilization are they

1768.919 --> 1772.159
like bones of the

1774.32 --> 1778.399
tartarians everybody's always imagining

1776.72 --> 1780.96
that there's some kind of genocide

1778.399 --> 1783.799
involved with

1780.96 --> 1786.48
these with these catacombs because it's

1783.799 --> 1788.84
just look so creepy and grim and like oh

1786.48 --> 1791.32
that's just like a necromancy Dungeons

1788.84 --> 1793.4399999999998
and Dragons environment or something and

1791.32 --> 1796.519
I'm like yeah that's exactly what

1793.44 --> 1799.76
Dungeons and Dragons Undead environments

1796.519 --> 1801.6
are inspired by by those catacombs but

1799.76 --> 1804.1589999999999
it doesn't mean that it all has to be

1801.6 --> 1804.1589999999999
evil

1810.64 --> 1818.0800000000002
necessarily do you think they believe in

1814.2 --> 1820.88
Flat Earth yeah they would have known

1818.08 --> 1823.1589999999999
absolutely can't be a master you can't

1820.88 --> 1826.679
be masterer Architects if you don't know

1823.159 --> 1826.679
the Earth is flat

1843.5 --> 1847.88
[Music]

1845.64 --> 1851.76
right so maybe the tartarians were

1847.88 --> 1851.7600000000002
actually just kind of

1852.12 --> 1857.039
pragmatic and that they might have had

1854.76 --> 1858.76
some kind of graves or whatever but that

1857.039 --> 1861.2
they just like

1858.76 --> 1863.76
accepted that yeah after you're dead

1861.2 --> 1868.2
your bones will be used placed in the

1863.76 --> 1868.2
catacombs to basically Empower those

1868.799 --> 1874.1589999999999
locations like maybe that was like a

1871.36 --> 1874.9189999999999
culturally integrated thing that they

1874.159 --> 1879.5590000000002
would

1874.919 --> 1879.5590000000002
do it's like service after

1879.639 --> 1885.32
death right I don't hear a lot of people

1882.519 --> 1885.32
talking about

1886.039 --> 1889.919
that but I mean

1890.36 --> 1895.9599999999998
the idea is not that unappealing to me

1892.88 --> 1898.279
it's like okay well after I die what you

1895.96 --> 1902.32
rather just be burnt and turned into

1898.279 --> 1906.12
ashes I mean that's total waste put in a

1902.32 --> 1910.32
grave until it like just gets

1906.12 --> 1912.9189999999999
replaced whatever gets too old or like

1910.32 --> 1915.48
what the hell does even happen with like

1912.919 --> 1919.44
really old Graves that are like oh we

1915.48 --> 1921.44
have to build stuff here

1919.44 --> 1924.279
really do so we're going to replace the

1921.44 --> 1924.279
graes to

1925.32 --> 1932.279
where I wonder like is it already a

1929.44 --> 1934.679
habit to just take really old skeletons

1932.279 --> 1937.24
from very old Graves and then

1934.679 --> 1939.039
once things have to move around that

1937.24 --> 1942.559
they just like okay just put them in a

1939.039 --> 1942.559
catacomb just put them over

1943.88 --> 1948.7990000000002
there cuz I mean there's been

1949.76 --> 1954.399
unimaginable unimaginable amount of

1965.6 --> 1973.9189999999999
graves some of their greatest Minds felt

1969.399 --> 1973.9189999999999
it was a what are you blabbering about

1975.84 --> 1980.9189999999999
where ancient Greeks

1979.039 --> 1983.36
I don't even know if the ancient Greeks

1980.919 --> 1983.3600000000001
really

2000.679 --> 2005.519
existed what was in their teachings well

2003.08 --> 2009.279
yeah that's just more of an indicator

2005.519 --> 2011.96
that they probably didn't exist in that

2009.279 --> 2014.0
sense as portrayed I mean there probably

2011.96 --> 2017.0
were ancient

2014.0 --> 2020.08
Greek but probably

2017.0 --> 2022.6
not with as an elaborate

2020.08 --> 2025.48
story as it's supposedly been

2022.6 --> 2026.1399999999999
reconstructed by modern by the modern

2025.48 --> 2028.679
West I

2026.14 --> 2033.279
[Music]

2028.679 --> 2033.279
mean I have my doubts

2041.279 --> 2045.919
yeah you require flat plane first yeah

2043.36 --> 2047.9599999999998
it is basic

2045.919 --> 2051.119
geometry you're going to need a flat

2047.96 --> 2053.679
Earth for that for anything geometric

2051.119 --> 2053.679
anything at

2057.0 --> 2065.399
all right and if the ancient Greece

2059.839 --> 2065.399
didn't realize that then that's probably

2066.72 --> 2074.24
trickery trickery from Modern

2070.32 --> 2075.9190000000003
interpreters or like adapting their

2074.24 --> 2083.04
reconstruction

2075.919 --> 2083.04
to the modern way of looking at things

2109.76 --> 2114.44
I think the ancient Greeks were also in

2111.88 --> 2117.56
on the conspiracy no I don't think that

2114.44 --> 2118.68
the ancient Greeks as we know them

2117.56 --> 2123.32
actually

2118.68 --> 2123.3199999999997
existed that's what I think

2131.32 --> 2139.2400000000002
I think it's a partially constructed

2135.0 --> 2139.24
backstory that's probably not

2152.88 --> 2159.119
real ancient Greek are like very popular

2156.72 --> 2161.2
references for for all kinds of supposed

2159.119 --> 2164.0
evidence just look at

2161.2 --> 2167.359
Aries for

2164.0 --> 2167.359
example it's a

2167.839 --> 2173.04
mess strong suspicion that there's a lot

2170.44 --> 2177.079
of like historical figures from supposed

2173.04 --> 2181.96
ancient gree that have been conjured up

2177.079 --> 2181.96
invented not real people

2194.07 --> 2199.67
[Music]

2204.64 --> 2210.839
right and I doubt that the Greek would

2207.24 --> 2212.9599999999996
be intellectually inept enough to truly

2210.839 --> 2215.4
believe that sticks and shadows would

2212.96 --> 2217.88
prove your standing on a

2215.4 --> 2220.359
sphere I think that they would be very

2217.88 --> 2222.28
well aware that it would require you to

2220.359 --> 2224.319
presuppose that you're standing on a

2222.28 --> 2228.4
sphere in order to come to that

2224.319 --> 2228.4
conclusion from the angles of the

2232.76 --> 2237.8
sun yeah

2235.119 --> 2241.1600000000003
in ancient Greek

2237.8 --> 2243.92
cosmology depictions of an of the world

2241.16 --> 2248.5989999999997
in Ancient Greece they were not exactly

2243.92 --> 2248.599
spherical based now were they

2260.4 --> 2267.56
or it's even weirder because the ancient

2263.52 --> 2271.04
gree didn't have any depictions of the

2267.56 --> 2276.319
world which makes it highly

2271.04 --> 2278.24
suspect again pointing at that perhaps

2276.319 --> 2280.04
the ancient Greek did didn't really

2278.24 --> 2284.1189999999997
exist like

2280.04 --> 2284.119
that it's an invented

2289.72 --> 2295.72
backstory sticks and shadows works for

2292.319 --> 2299.0
both models yeah or it doesn't work for

2295.72 --> 2303.52
either models it's it's a matter of

2299.0 --> 2303.52
perspective letter Sage

2317.119 --> 2323.4
have I got a cold

2318.96 --> 2323.4
no but I am kind of snippy

2326.44 --> 2335.119
today yeah dude I haven't had a cold

2330.76 --> 2335.119
in a long long

2336.44 --> 2344.64
time I don't get cold I just get sniffy

2340.48 --> 2347.079
snotty days it's annoying it's it's

2344.64 --> 2349.72
unfortunately just part of my physiology

2347.079 --> 2351.8390000000004
my mother would always have that as

2349.72 --> 2355.1189999999997
well

2351.839 --> 2359.839
just you would think that she would

2355.119 --> 2359.839
always have a cold but she didn't

2378.96 --> 2386.28
I think pagas and then Aristotle proved

2383.119 --> 2388.6400000000003
it proved what that you can presuppose

2386.28 --> 2389.76
your standing on a sphere by measuring

2388.64 --> 2391.8799999999997
solar

2389.76 --> 2395.8390000000004
angles on the

2391.88 --> 2398.599
earth I doubt it I doubt they would have

2395.839 --> 2400.7599999999998
spent their rep utation on doing

2398.599 --> 2404.6400000000003
something that

2400.76 --> 2404.6400000000003
stupid if they were even

2405.599 --> 2410.8
real no it's fairly common with cult

2408.48 --> 2413.64
yeah except when you have a

2410.8 --> 2416.4
cult it's different because the sneezing

2413.64 --> 2419.8799999999997
becomes compulsive you get inflammation

2416.4 --> 2424.7200000000003
you get all kinds of

2419.88 --> 2424.7200000000003
other side effects that I don't

2424.839 --> 2430.4
have yeah I don't have a cold

2427.96 --> 2430.4
you got

2441.079 --> 2447.319
it okay Moxy

2443.88 --> 2450.319
that's it's not [ __ ] funny come back

2447.319 --> 2450.319

2457.37 --> 2460.44
[Music]

2463.48 --> 2466.4
yeah and next

2468.319 --> 2474.72
time maybe don't do that and then I'll

2472.28 --> 2474.7200000000003
let you

2485.56 --> 2490.44
stay it's nothing to be ashame yeah I'm

2488.119 --> 2494.56
not ashamed of if you're going to state

2490.44 --> 2499.28
that I have a cold again I will ban

2494.56 --> 2502.16
you got it I don't have a c i just like

2499.28 --> 2506.4
this I'm like this pretty much all

2502.16 --> 2509.24
throughout the year I'm typically very

2506.4 --> 2512.44
sniffy it's just something that happens

2509.24 --> 2514.68
it's HP it happens when I

2512.44 --> 2519.2400000000002
talk I think it might be like the

2514.68 --> 2519.24
vibration of my voice just doing that

2523.64 --> 2530.5989999999997
to rug up in the cold well it's not that

2526.96 --> 2532.88
cold and I don't have a cold and the

2530.599 --> 2535.76
next person that's going to tell me I

2532.88 --> 2538.1600000000003
have a cold or reference having a cold

2535.76 --> 2540.92
in any way is going to be banned cuz I'm

2538.16 --> 2544.04
not going to talk about that at all you

2540.92 --> 2544.04
got it

2551.4 --> 2556.359
that's a 30 minutes time out next time

2626.28 --> 2632.44
subjects and their stupid distractions

2628.72 --> 2637.16
in my chat go ahead I will ban you

2632.44 --> 2640.119
too yeah I don't want you guys

2637.16 --> 2643.64

bite out of my Illuminati go

2685.52 --> 2691.0

2692.64 --> 2695.839
cold oh

2696.04 --> 2700.0
well for

[Music]

2745.43 --> 2749.94
[Music]

2752.24 --> 2757.0789999999997
in the meantime Earth is measured flat

2758.96 --> 2765.28
and the globe model requires a flat

2769.839 --> 2775.72
plane no flat plane no glow

2785.92 --> 2789.88
h for

2828.599 --> 2834.079
what Russell Brand what are you no ler

2832.76 --> 2836.3590000000004
saidage you have no idea what you're

2834.079 --> 2836.3590000000004
talking

2839.44 --> 2843.68
about what video

2861.2 --> 2868.64
oh Court ruling about the medical

2864.16 --> 2868.64
experiments yeah dude that's old news to

2870.64 --> 2878.839
me certainly don't need to have Russell

2874.92 --> 2878.839
Brand tell me that h

2886.4 --> 2891.839
yeah I know I know the courts have said

2889.4 --> 2893.319
that the medical experiment is an

2891.839 --> 2897.92
experiment and

2893.319 --> 2900.839
not what it was designated as I know

2897.92 --> 2904.319
that's been happening in the last

2900.839 --> 2909.92
month all over the

2904.319 --> 2909.92
place okay and I can that for death

2941.96 --> 2946.2400000000002
but I mean like through Infowars and all

2944.2 --> 2949.9199999999996
that I've already caught on to that

2946.24 --> 2949.9199999999996
stuff it's been out there for

2950.2 --> 2956.48
weeks like I don't really feel like oh I

2953.16 --> 2960.44
should be talking about that I dude I

2956.48 --> 2963.64
was talking about that three years ago

2960.44 --> 2966.799
three years ago and in the videos where

2963.64 --> 2970.92
I would talk about that well guess what

2966.799 --> 2970.92
happened to those videos yeah they got

2972.079 --> 2978.52
removed so now some

2975.079 --> 2980.6400000000003
stupid fake British accent hipster is

2978.52 --> 2984.64
going to tell me oh oh look at this

2980.64 --> 2989.04
thing oh like [ __ ] you I already know

2984.64 --> 2989.04
all that crap I knew that four years

2995.64 --> 2999.68
ago for

3033.1 --> 3036.35
[Music]

3037.319 --> 3043.24
I mean you know what Russell Brand is to

3047.16 --> 3053.0789999999997
me he's like a tavestock conspiracy

3050.24 --> 3053.0789999999997
theorist he's

3053.839 --> 3061.5589999999997
like the Beatles but not of music but of

3058.2 --> 3062.99
just conspiracy talk he is like the

3061.559 --> 3066.0400000000004
Beatles of conspiracy

3062.99 --> 3066.04
[Music]

3068.96 --> 3073.88
[Music]

3070.599 --> 3076.52
talk it just feels like that it felt

3073.88 --> 3079.559
like that from the start it just this

3076.52 --> 3083.0
nonstop frequency of like this is a

3079.559 --> 3083.0
[ __ ] tapest

3083.88 --> 3089.359
person nonstop

3087.079 --> 3091.1600000000003
everything he does like that's a tapest

3089.359 --> 3094.72
St

3091.16 --> 3094.72
person just like the

3110.04 --> 3117.04
Beatles I mean maybe I'm totally out of

3113.119 --> 3117.04
order but I mean

3117.68 --> 3124.319
my intuition just tells me like Russell

3121.04 --> 3125.64
Brand is a freaking daffo conspiracy

3124.319 --> 3129.319
theorist I

3125.64 --> 3131.839
mean there's no doubt in my mind and I

3129.319 --> 3134.44
knew it from the very very first time I

3131.839 --> 3134.44
ever saw

3138.799 --> 3145.92
him but I don't know maybe you all don't

3142.0 --> 3145.92
care whatever

3153.91 --> 3159.23
[Music]

3168.4 --> 3174.319
yeah good luck with that flatter Sage

3171.2 --> 3177.16
yeah I on purpose I didn't answer akumu

3174.319 --> 3181.2
virus CU I know what he was do and He

3177.16 --> 3181.2
will just like keep twisting and

3182.72 --> 3189.2
twisting yeah you can never convince him

3186.76 --> 3191.88
that you require a flat Earth to create

3189.2 --> 3194.5589999999997
a globe because he's a [ __ ] Ballard

3191.88 --> 3199.2000000000003
and he doesn't feel like ever admitting

3194.559 --> 3201.4
that no matter what so I just ignore him

3199.2 --> 3204.52
when he ask these questions what that

3201.4 --> 3207.119
means to me is he is making a religious

3204.52 --> 3208.64
statement

3207.119 --> 3212.319
like

3208.64 --> 3215.799
no denied I'm going

3212.319 --> 3221.0
to twist it around and twist it around

3215.799 --> 3221.0
until the answer is no longer an

3223.359 --> 3229.839
answer so just tell akumu virus hey

3226.96 --> 3233.52
akumu virus you go live on your [ __ ]

3229.839 --> 3236.72
[ __ ] Globe okay we don't care that you

3233.52 --> 3239.04
don't want to figure it out that you can

3236.72 --> 3241.68
twist it to all hell in your

3239.04 --> 3246.72
head and that you will never admit that

3241.68 --> 3246.72
the Earth is measured flat we don't

3247.119 --> 3250.599
care that's my

3257.2 --> 3263.2
solution no I'm not

3259.52 --> 3263.2
mute what are you talking

3265.359 --> 3269.359
about for

3277.62 --> 3280.75
[Music]

3302.27 --> 3310.079
[Music]

3307.24 --> 3312.64
yeah flatter stage and that's why I

3310.079 --> 3312.6400000000003
didn't even

3325.319 --> 3329.2799999999997
try for

3332.36 --> 3335.4190000000003
[Music]

3352.33 --> 3355.489
[Music]

3370.16 --> 3376.24
oh he he is intelligent enough to have a

3372.92 --> 3379.119
conversation is just not honest enough

3376.24 --> 3381.839
to make it an honest

3379.119 --> 3384.319
conversation so yeah just let him

3381.839 --> 3388.24
believe he's on a [ __ ]

3384.319 --> 3391.319
Globe let him yeah

3388.24 --> 3394.0389999999998
yeah he lives on a [ __ ]

3391.319 --> 3396.52
Globe he could just shove it up his ass

3394.039 --> 3399.44
and that's that's the

3396.52 --> 3402.0
way you should probably deal with it

3399.44 --> 3405.48
because he's never going to give in ever

3402.0 --> 3408.559
I mean he hangs around here all the

3405.48 --> 3409.799
time he does the same [ __ ] over and over

3408.559 --> 3413.559
and over

3409.799 --> 3417.24
again I've spent like an hour trying to

3413.559 --> 3419.88
get through to him

3417.24 --> 3423.0389999999998
then after some point I just get

3419.88 --> 3425.76
violent because he's a [ __ ] mental

3423.039 --> 3428.2000000000003
patient and the worst case of Bal

3425.76 --> 3431.119
heartedness that I've ever come across

3428.2 --> 3434.0
like I don't know anybody that's worse

3431.119 --> 3439.0
there's no point in trying to get

3434.0 --> 3439.0
through to him no point at all

3467.559 --> 3474.119
yeah you can stop the [ __ ] act akumo

3471.559 --> 3476.8390000000004
virus you can stop virtue signaling your

3474.119 --> 3478.48

3476.839 --> 3481.2
yeah you're

3478.48 --> 3485.119

3536.599 --> 3542.1600000000003
it's your [ __ ] religion you suspend

3539.68 --> 3545.9199999999996
your own disbelief about the entirety of

3542.16 --> 3548.44
reality just to maintain this illusion

3545.92 --> 3551.16
towards yourself like you're actually

3548.44 --> 3556.28
being honest [ __ ] you akumu virus we

3551.16 --> 3556.2799999999997

3562.96 --> 3569.079
you're the only person you're halfway

3565.559 --> 3569.079
convinced of that hor

3583.76 --> 3589.6800000000003
[ __ ] you don't know me don't know me

3587.0 --> 3592.68

3589.68 --> 3592.68
anybody

3610.039 --> 3614.039
see so this is just the point where

3612.0 --> 3618.24
whatever you're going to say he's just

3614.039 --> 3620.76
going to say no no I'm not a rebellious

3618.24 --> 3623.5989999999997
six-year-old that's just going to say no

3620.76 --> 3626.44
to whatever you say because your Vantage

3623.599 --> 3628.92
Point was it wasn't a ball it's not like

3626.44 --> 3632.2000000000003
I'm just going to deny absolutely

3628.92 --> 3634.96
everything that is mentioned ever after

3632.2 --> 3639.839
this point I

3634.96 --> 3643.799
mean just stop responding to him let him

3639.839 --> 3647.44
mutter it out like a nutcase which is

3643.799 --> 3650.119
what that is yeah people like that are

3647.44 --> 3656.44
Nut Cases you just need to let them

3650.119 --> 3660.76
ramble it out and then not respond

3656.44 --> 3660.76
to that you got

3660.92 --> 3667.48
it that's the only way it's going to

3663.64 --> 3669.64
stop or or you can keep trying to push

3667.48 --> 3672.359
him and then I'll be forced to kick him

3669.64 --> 3674.799
out because he'll never shut the [ __ ] up

3672.359 --> 3674.799
ever

3678.0 --> 3684.4
again Flat Earth Sage so I'd appreciate

3681.799 --> 3687.64
if you just let him

3684.4 --> 3688.799
mutter his non nonsense and not respond

3687.64 --> 3692.5989999999997
to it

3688.799 --> 3695.48
anymore so we can move on and not have

3692.599 --> 3699.079
the entire show become about [ __ ]

3695.48 --> 3702.92
akumu virus being a habitual balard

3699.079 --> 3707.0
lying to himself

3702.92 --> 3709.799
okay cuz I don't feel like making the

3707.0 --> 3712.64
show all about

3709.799 --> 3715.88
that like to continue the conversation

3712.64 --> 3715.8799999999997

what is he done to cause that I already

3757.079 --> 3763.3590000000004
explained all of that but you being the

3759.72 --> 3766.0
Ballard that you are zap tappy very

Ballard just forget everything that was

3774.68 --> 3780.24
that just happened right just oh oh

3777.92 --> 3782.2000000000003
nothing happened I'm living on a globe

3780.24 --> 3786.4799999999996
yeah that's the default position for any

3782.2 --> 3789.52
Ballard oh nothing was said nothing was

3786.48 --> 3792.68
understood I just live on a globe yeah

3789.52 --> 3794.44
that's default position we know there's

3792.68 --> 3797.2
no point in trying to get through to a

3794.44 --> 3799.799
ball [ __ ] because they just conveniently

3797.2 --> 3804.3999999999996
forget everything you

3799.799 --> 3804.4
said that's what they do

3807.48 --> 3813.279
lies are intentional yeah yeah and it is

3809.88 --> 3817.079
intentional you are lying intentionally

3813.279 --> 3820.4
you're lying to yourself

3817.079 --> 3823.279
intentionally yeah and then you suspend

3820.4 --> 3825.48
your disbelief so you don't really

3823.279 --> 3827.92
consciously know it's happening yeah but

3825.48 --> 3831.319
you are lying and you're lying to

3827.92 --> 3833.7200000000003
yourself and it is very humiliating but

3831.319 --> 3836.88
you're willing to sit through that

3833.72 --> 3839.48
humiliation like some kind of ball [ __ ]

3836.88 --> 3842.279
Marti cuz that's what you do because

3839.48 --> 3845.48
that's all you have left yeah martier

3842.279 --> 3848.48
for your [ __ ] religion it's all you

3845.48 --> 3848.48
have

3856.07 --> 3859.1090000000004
[Music]

3865.63 --> 3873.6800000000003
[Music]

3869.599 --> 3873.6800000000003
okay I'll see you

3884.68 --> 3890.799
tomorrow YouTu is tyy you two can [ __ ]

3888.68 --> 3895.72
off I'll see you in half an

3890.799 --> 3895.72
hour and now we can move on

3915.76 --> 3920.6800000000003
yeah yeah it's a BAL tarded day today

3918.68 --> 3924.24
there's like all this stupid messages

3920.68 --> 3927.1189999999997
everywhere as well so I knew I was going

3924.24 --> 3930.279
to have to like kick out and time out a

3927.119 --> 3930.279
whole bunch of ballards

3930.44 --> 3936.52
today cuz it's itching for

3933.52 --> 3936.52
them

3939.24 --> 3946.64
yeah it's all falling apart at

3943.16 --> 3949.0
seams they need some extra time to keep

3946.64 --> 3950.48
projecting outward how they're all right

3949.0 --> 3954.24
about everything even though they're

3950.48 --> 3954.2400000000002
wrong about everything

3958.4 --> 3965.4
right rather spend an hour time just

3963.0 --> 3967.559
discussing with you how they're not

3965.4 --> 3971.079
lying how they're not wrong about

3967.559 --> 3973.559
everything avoiding the actual

3971.079 --> 3976.48
details whatever the foundation of their

3973.559 --> 3978.6400000000003
argument is to just make you get lost in

3976.48 --> 3981.799
the weeds because if you get lost in the

3978.64 --> 3984.5989999999997
weeds well then their [ __ ]

3981.799 --> 3986.88
convictions their religiously founded

3984.599 --> 3990.839
convictions about the Earth being a

3986.88 --> 3993.1600000000003
globe can just be avoided entirely which

3990.839 --> 3995.799
is the only safe position for a

3993.16 --> 3995.799
religious

3997.4 --> 4002.599
balard it's the only safe position they

4000.52 --> 4006.0389999999998
can ever

4002.599 --> 4010.6400000000003
attain and today is just one of those

4006.039 --> 4010.6400000000003
days where it's all itching

4015.92 --> 4019.4
black foot Indians

4022.279 --> 4026.4
what hello clutch good see

4036.079 --> 4039.079
you

4044.359 --> 4050.4
huh he dad Warriors okay that's freaky

4089.359 --> 4094.119
all right

4091.44 --> 4096.04
anyway I did throw out the idea today

4094.119 --> 4100.679
about the whole catacombs thing and then

4096.04 --> 4104.12
everybody rolled over it and moved on to

4100.679 --> 4106.839
endless bickering cuz that happens every

4104.12 --> 4110.239
time right I roll out a A Whole New

4106.839 --> 4114.839
Concept an Insight oh quickly move on to

4110.239 --> 4114.839
the more familiar bickering That Never

4121.12 --> 4127.759
Ends but yeah I have been

4124.799 --> 4130.5199999999995
thinking about the catacombs and all the

4127.759 --> 4134.719
bones and their function and like how

4130.52 --> 4137.92
did they get there whose bones are those

4134.719 --> 4139.96
I mean yeah and conspiracy theorist

4137.92 --> 4141.359
that's interfer for it's immediately

4139.96 --> 4143.88
going to be like oh they're all

4141.359 --> 4147.1990000000005
sacrificed people or they're the

4143.88 --> 4149.56
genocided previous civilization but yeah

4147.199 --> 4149.5599999999995
what if

4149.799 --> 4158.44
it's just an ancient tradition to do

4155.56 --> 4162.359
that maybe it even worked like okay

4158.44 --> 4162.3589999999995
you're going to live in the city

4162.44 --> 4167.3589999999995
confines City confines with the

4169.199 --> 4174.839
with all with the

4171.719 --> 4177.279
catacombs attract people for some

4174.839 --> 4179.04
reasons like the bones attract people

4177.279 --> 4182.319
people are going to be drawn in if you

4179.04 --> 4185.2789999999995
want to then live in the city well then

4182.319 --> 4187.159000000001
maybe it's like part of the deal like

4185.279 --> 4190.92
you live in the city if you die in the

4187.159 --> 4193.4
city then your bones go into the

4190.92 --> 4197.76
catacombs to expand

4193.4 --> 4197.759999999999
them maybe that's how it

4204.52 --> 4209.76
worked I've just been putting thought to

4207.52 --> 4213.120000000001
it and I would love to

4209.76 --> 4216.400000000001
discuss the potential dynamics of how

4213.12 --> 4220.8
that all happened without immediately

4216.4 --> 4220.799999999999
assuming something super nefarious

4243.239 --> 4247.639999999999
yeah flatter Sage I know what you mean

4292.84 --> 4297.04
if I'm not mistaken only the most

4294.76 --> 4299.4400000000005
important how do you know how does that

4297.04 --> 4299.44
where is

4300.8 --> 4307.92
that how are you concluding that what

4304.36 --> 4309.679
information are you going by in order to

4307.92 --> 4312.159
make that

4309.679 --> 4314.88
conclusion because as far as I know

4312.159 --> 4319.638999999999
there is like no information about the

4314.88 --> 4324.04
orig of that at all like zero zero

4319.639 --> 4324.04
references it's all been removed

4346.639 --> 4351.04
unless there is some something out there

4349.04 --> 4354.159
that I've overlooked or that recently

4351.04 --> 4356.679
came afloat but as far as I know there

4354.159 --> 4359.44
is literally of all the catacombs

4356.679 --> 4364.76
everywhere in the world there's zero

4359.44 --> 4367.839999999999
reference as to how that formed zero

4364.76 --> 4371.08
reference nobody knows

4367.84 --> 4375.96
nobody so how did that

4371.08 --> 4375.96
happen how old are they

4385.8 --> 4390.360000000001
you would just be buried in IR regular

4387.6 --> 4392.8
how do you know that what based on what

4390.36 --> 4395.48
we're told about how things happen in

4392.8 --> 4395.4800000000005
medieval

4404.12 --> 4408.08
times for

4437.32 --> 4443.5599999999995
how do I know because it's not the first

4440.4 --> 4445.36
time that the whole story about the

4443.56 --> 4448.159000000001
catacombs has been brought to my

4445.36 --> 4450.719
attention I mean that happened too like

4448.159 --> 4450.719
when I was

4451.84 --> 4459.159000000001
17 My overall conclusion is that nobody

4456.92 --> 4461.6
knows

4459.159 --> 4463.239
nobody like not even the [ __ ]

4461.6 --> 4466.360000000001
Freemasons

4463.239 --> 4471.5199999999995
know nobody knows

4466.36 --> 4475.199
like how that happened who did that

4471.52 --> 4478.52
when and how like on a voluntary basis

4475.199 --> 4480.04
or on a sacrifice in secret in the open

4478.52 --> 4482.1990000000005
nobody [ __ ]

4480.04 --> 4485.96
knows

4482.199 --> 4485.96
nobody there's no

4486.8 --> 4491.56
references it's just there

4501.159 --> 4507.5199999999995
the poor W in the catacombs with the

4503.12 --> 4513.44
grave well yeah well bers boy that

4507.52 --> 4515.400000000001
is not a bad attempt to reconstruct in

4513.44 --> 4518.5199999999995
your mind like how things could have

4515.4 --> 4522.0
happened right but that's an idea that's

4518.52 --> 4526.120000000001
not like evident it's not evidenced by

4522.0 --> 4527.92
anything not that I mind I mean I'm

4526.12 --> 4532.84
speculating about it

4527.92 --> 4537.2390000000005
too the point is there is no tangible

4532.84 --> 4542.96
reference to it none it's just

4537.239 --> 4547.599999999999
there nobody knows how when

4542.96 --> 4547.6
why who nobody [ __ ]

4548.159 --> 4554.719
knows I've never come across one piece

4552.28 --> 4559.44
of actual what you can consider evidence

4554.719 --> 4561.719
that actually proves like how and who

4559.44 --> 4561.719
and

4562.719 --> 4569.56
when no

4565.84 --> 4574.360000000001
reference just tons and tons of

4569.56 --> 4574.360000000001
speculation wild inspir

4575.6 --> 4582.719
Inspirations cuz

4578.76 --> 4585.52
yeah Mass Graves do mysterious Mass

4582.719 --> 4588.28
Graves to do tend to like tint at

4585.52 --> 4592.040000000001
people's inspiration and then they come

4588.28 --> 4595.159
up with all kinds of crazy ideas about

4592.04 --> 4597.48
it it must have stank in the how do you

4595.159 --> 4597.48
know

4598.0 --> 4603.88
that I don't think so Bor boy I think

4600.679 --> 4603.88
that they clean it all

4611.88 --> 4616.4400000000005
out bleached it

4623.679 --> 4627.679
well they obviously treated the

4632.639 --> 4636.96
bones it certainly is a mystery yeah I

4635.48 --> 4641.04
know it

4636.96 --> 4642.719
is and it's like a very strange mystery

4641.04 --> 4646.639
because it's

4642.719 --> 4650.12
everywhere like every freaking city in

4646.639 --> 4652.52
the world has them and nobody [ __ ]

4650.12 --> 4655.599999999999
knows how it happened

4652.52 --> 4659.639
nobody okay that's a [ __ ]

4655.6 --> 4659.639
mystery a mystery is

4666.6 --> 4677.8
[Music]

4673.84 --> 4677.8
everywhere e

4690.51 --> 4693.649
[Music]

4697.12 --> 4700.159
[Music]

4712.77 --> 4715.939
[Music]

4725.6 --> 4728.84
all right I'm putting that in the

4730.44 --> 4736.5599999999995
title maybe it was simply as no more

4733.56 --> 4736.56
room

4740.199 --> 4746.36
well perhaps

4742.239 --> 4749.879999999999
CL the point is is that they manag to

4746.36 --> 4751.5199999999995
actually use the

4749.88 --> 4756.8
bones

4751.52 --> 4756.8
for positive practical purposes

4766.52 --> 4773.6
right which makes me think that maybe

4769.32 --> 4773.599999999999
that was just like the tartarian

4773.76 --> 4778.96
way that they all did that that they all

4777.12 --> 4782.08
were like yeah we live our lives and

4778.96 --> 4783.6
then when you die your bones go to the

4782.08 --> 4787.639
catacombs

4783.6 --> 4790.4400000000005
so we can then still like bathe in the

4787.639 --> 4790.4400000000005
presence of our

4790.639 --> 4795.76
ancestors they could have thought of it

4792.76 --> 4798.1990000000005
like that it's like oh your bones are

4795.76 --> 4799.0
put into the catacombs in that church

4798.199 --> 4802.719
and

4799.0 --> 4806.0
then the the church whatever it was the

4802.719 --> 4808.36
temple would be like the place you go to

4806.0 --> 4811.239
and then feel the presence of all the

4808.36 --> 4813.04
ancestors kind of like that I mean they

4811.239 --> 4815.919999999999
probably viewed it like a religious

4813.04 --> 4815.92
experience in that

4818.4 --> 4825.239
sense like when I the more I think about

4821.84 --> 4828.4400000000005
it logically the more it makes sense

4825.239 --> 4828.44
to the point where I'm

4828.92 --> 4834.88
like it doesn't seem like too bad of

4832.32 --> 4838.04
Fate like

4834.88 --> 4841.639
yeah I mean I'd rather have my bones

4838.04 --> 4845.199
become part of a catacomb to like

4841.639 --> 4850.28
Empower a place than to just be like

4845.199 --> 4853.28
burned up in some oven to ashes and then

4850.28 --> 4853.28
nothing

4853.639 --> 4857.6
yeah e

4889.92 --> 4894.2390000000005
buried in a cacom yeah but it's not even

4892.04 --> 4897.159
buried it's like just having your bones

4894.239 --> 4899.638999999999
and your skull just arranged into

4897.159 --> 4904.679
these specific

4899.639 --> 4904.679
ways to empower that

4908.0 --> 4913.92
place I mean your skeleton's not going

4910.52 --> 4915.88
to be like left as a whole right your

4913.92 --> 4917.4800000000005
your bones are literally going to become

4915.88 --> 4921.28
building

4917.48 --> 4925.36
blocks but I mean how is that worse than

4921.28 --> 4925.36
just being burnt up and your ashes

4925.76 --> 4929.84
scattered to be completely

4931.719 --> 4936.12
forgotten over time

4961.04 --> 4965.679
you would be dead so you would know no

4963.76 --> 4969.159000000001
how would you know that you wouldn't

4965.679 --> 4970.8
know how do you know you're not aware of

4969.159 --> 4973.5199999999995
anything after you're

4970.8 --> 4977.159000000001
dead just because you're not going to be

4973.52 --> 4977.159000000001
able to communicate that

4977.719 --> 4984.28
reliably doesn't mean that you're not

4980.239 --> 4984.28
aware after death

5030.239 --> 5035.839999999999
huh wow okay borders boy that's nuts

5052.04 --> 5058.48
no where no he can't send you a links he

5054.88 --> 5058.4800000000005

5123.32 --> 5127.28
stop for

5172.88 --> 5176.529
[Music]

5198.4 --> 5203.28
what

5200.32 --> 5206.96
resurrected

5203.28 --> 5206.96
uh all righty

5207.52 --> 5212.8
then all right anyway anybody watching

5210.52 --> 5217.4800000000005
don't forget to Rogan it

5212.8 --> 5217.4800000000005
up see you only one

5253.92 --> 5256.92
okay

5296.6 --> 5302.2390000000005
what okay flatter S I didn't know that

5304.44 --> 5307.5599999999995
tomorrow I'll make

5333.04 --> 5336.04
one

5363.04 --> 5367.08
for for

5379.16 --> 5382.229
[Music]

5410.28 --> 5416.0
so me what I have no idea what you're

5413.639 --> 5416.0
talking

5419.199 --> 5425.44
about they did they did the St it's a

5422.56 --> 5429.96
giant mess I mean it's it's all

5425.44 --> 5429.96
crap I haven't even watched any of

5452.92 --> 5455.92
it

5482.92 --> 5486.88
e for

5514.28 --> 5518.36
right so yeah it's getting kind of

5516.0 --> 5522.96
depressing at this

5518.36 --> 5522.96
point I was mostly just wondering

5525.119 --> 5532.28
like who were these bones and why is

5528.84 --> 5532.28
there no information about

5535.4 --> 5544.0
it like there's no

5538.8 --> 5546.400000000001
record of the Catacombs being built the

5544.0 --> 5548.56
bones being placed it's like it seems

5546.4 --> 5551.679
like it's off the

5548.56 --> 5555.719
Record how can that be why is there no

5551.679 --> 5555.719
record of that of such a thing

5565.679 --> 5570.8
anywhere you [ __ ] kidding me

5575.92 --> 5579.04
get the [ __ ] out of

5583.6 --> 5590.639
here get the [ __ ]

5586.96 --> 5593.36
out so now they're

5590.639 --> 5595.639
dead done with these [ __ ] flies I

5593.36 --> 5599.48
mean it's fine if you want to fly and

5595.639 --> 5602.679
hang around these [ __ ] creatures

5599.48 --> 5607.0
continually want to get on the goddamn

5602.679 --> 5609.96
camera I'm sick of them yeah I mean I I

5607.0 --> 5612.679
don't normally Hur a fly but if you as a

5609.96 --> 5616.92
fly insist on like oh yeah let's go

5612.679 --> 5621.4400000000005
right in front of the camera you die

5616.92 --> 5621.4400000000005
then [ __ ] you flies

5638.639 --> 5643.56
there are so many yeah but the point is

5641.04 --> 5646.719
is that there is literally

5643.56 --> 5651.84
no record of it and that's so weird

5646.719 --> 5651.84
about it I mean did they do it in

5654.92 --> 5662.2390000000005
secret who did

5658.32 --> 5666.119
it was it the Catholic church that did

5662.239 --> 5669.678999999999
that like in secet secret I mean it does

5666.119 --> 5673.88
seem that the catacombs and the bones

5669.679 --> 5677.119
installed there do like draw people in

5673.88 --> 5681.159000000001
so did they do it in secret to draw

5677.119 --> 5684.679
people in like did they just

5681.159 --> 5687.5199999999995
like secretly take old

5684.679 --> 5690.08
Graves clear them out when there was no

5687.52 --> 5693.719
more family looking after them and then

5690.08 --> 5694.8
just use them to install them in the in

5693.719 --> 5697.159
the

5694.8 --> 5701.04
catacombs and that that would draw in

5697.159 --> 5704.159
more people into the church etc etc is

5701.04 --> 5707.88
that why there wasn't any record of it

5704.159 --> 5710.08
that they kind of like did it in

5707.88 --> 5713.04
secret

5710.08 --> 5715.84
or it remains a

5713.04 --> 5718.28
mystery but the craziest thing is is

5715.84 --> 5721.0
that it's not just like one location

5718.28 --> 5723.759999999999
somewhere that it's

5721.0 --> 5729.28
everywhere everywhere in Europe

5723.76 --> 5729.280000000001
everywhere in the United States that's

5738.8 --> 5744.4800000000005
strange yeah if it was just one

5742.36 --> 5745.679
location that would have been weird

5744.48 --> 5748.718999999999
enough as it

5745.679 --> 5751.92
is but it's

5748.719 --> 5755.639
everywhere so it was a systematic thing

5751.92 --> 5755.639
so how did it happen

5762.04 --> 5770.159
and why is there no record of it at

5767.159 --> 5772.879999999999
all skull and yeah what the hell would

5770.159 --> 5772.879999999999
they have to do with

5777.199 --> 5784.96
it that's strange I mean maybe skull and

5781.679 --> 5788.719
bones but I don't think skull and bones

5784.96 --> 5788.719
like I don't think

5789.04 --> 5793.719
so but maybe you're right who

5798.679 --> 5804.08
knows but I mean Skull and Bones doesn't

5801.44 --> 5807.28
typically have access to monolithic

5804.08 --> 5809.6
buildings and all that so it doesn't

5807.28 --> 5812.119
really make a lot of

5809.6 --> 5814.320000000001
sense like I'm sure they would have

5812.119 --> 5816.199
known about it does that mean that they

5814.32 --> 5819.96
were involved with

5816.199 --> 5819.96
it I kind of doubt

5822.04 --> 5828.639
it

5824.0 --> 5830.76
right so who did that when did they do

5828.639 --> 5835.400000000001
it was it a

5830.76 --> 5837.84
secret or was it just like part of the

5835.4 --> 5841.08
previous culture the tartaria way of

5837.84 --> 5844.2390000000005
doing things and that it was all

5841.08 --> 5846.48
deleted like

5844.239 --> 5848.718999999999
the followup

5846.48 --> 5851.759999999999
civilization and how they would rewrite

5848.719 --> 5854.8
history didn't want anybody to

5851.76 --> 5857.119000000001
know that perhaps the tartarians had a

5854.8 --> 5858.6
tradition of doing that that that's how

5857.119 --> 5861.08
they dealt with the dead and that

5858.6 --> 5863.639
there's a whole thing with it and he

5861.08 --> 5865.719
didn't want to remove it all would be

5863.639 --> 5868.639
too much of a hassle and that it has a

5865.719 --> 5870.44
positive influence so they just kind of

5868.639 --> 5873.8
left everything as

5870.44 --> 5877.919999999999
is and just

5873.8 --> 5877.92
not tell anybody

5879.36 --> 5886.5199999999995
how right so is are the bones in the

5883.719 --> 5888.92
catacombs from a previous civilization

5886.52 --> 5889.88
tartaria is that what they all did with

5888.92 --> 5893.52
their

5889.88 --> 5896.08
dead or is it not

5893.52 --> 5899.4800000000005
necessarily from

5896.08 --> 5899.48
tartaria is it

5900.04 --> 5906.5199999999995
just people and like this is what

5904.119 --> 5908.4
this is what the Catholics or whatever

5906.52 --> 5910.719
the Jesuits whatever you want to call

5908.4 --> 5913.879999999999
them what they

5910.719 --> 5916.8
did with like old Graves and they didn't

5913.88 --> 5918.76
tell anybody it was arguably illegal but

5916.8 --> 5922.76
they'd still do it because there wasn't

5918.76 --> 5925.400000000001
a palpable advantage of like installing

5922.76 --> 5925.400000000001
these bone

5928.32 --> 5935.44
structures is there no record of it

5930.92 --> 5935.4400000000005
because it was basically done illegally

5939.159 --> 5944.839999999999
secretly right so that it remains a

5946.32 --> 5951.119
mystery and it's not just pointing at

5949.52 --> 5956.719
One Direction there could have been

5951.119 --> 5956.719
several different ways that that this

5957.199 --> 5964.08
happened could have been part of the

5960.28 --> 5966.0
traditions of the tartarian society

5964.08 --> 5968.4
or it could have been post tartarian

5966.0 --> 5971.92
society and that this is just

5968.4 --> 5973.44
what those responsible for burials would

5971.92 --> 5977.0
secretly

5973.44 --> 5977.0
do with old

5981.679 --> 5987.52
graves because there was a a palpable

5984.8 --> 5990.8
benefit for doing

5987.52 --> 5994.52
that an advantage of doing that and it

5990.8 --> 5998.76
was worth doing it in secret yeah we

5994.52 --> 6003.679
don't know we don't know built for

5998.76 --> 6003.679
ritualistic I don't know

6004.88 --> 6010.0
maybe I bet a whole bunch of like people

6008.28 --> 6012.5199999999995
that think they come communicate with

6010.0 --> 6014.04
the dead would all be very fascinated at

6012.52 --> 6016.4400000000005
locations like

6014.04 --> 6019.639
that who knows what the hell they were

6016.44 --> 6019.638999999999
doing with

6021.0 --> 6026.96
it I mean it could get get potentially

6024.52 --> 6026.96
very

6028.239 --> 6034.718999999999
dark but that doesn't mean that it's

6031.8 --> 6038.360000000001
intended for that

6034.719 --> 6040.4800000000005
specifically right so oh dark things

6038.36 --> 6043.199
happened there oh really so that means

6040.48 --> 6046.5199999999995
it was always built specifically for

6043.199 --> 6050.0
dark things to happen there no probably

6046.52 --> 6054.8
not I'm trying to

6050.0 --> 6054.8
reconstruct how did this happen

6060.96 --> 6066.56
ancient Brooks round houses they B the

6063.719 --> 6068.719
dead under the floor in the

6066.56 --> 6073.119000000001
ground yes that's what I was thinking

6068.719 --> 6076.88
too borders way and yeah that

6073.119 --> 6076.88
that's that that's my

6078.159 --> 6084.239
point this could have just been like the

6080.52 --> 6084.2390000000005
tartarian tradition

6084.44 --> 6089.598999999999
and then they expanded it

6087.0 --> 6091.28
because there were just like bigger

6089.599 --> 6093.52
cities more

6091.28 --> 6095.32
people and then they had to build the

6093.52 --> 6098.84
catacombs for it and then it turned out

6095.32 --> 6098.84
to have like this massive

6102.48 --> 6108.799999999999
Advantage right but yeah

6105.4 --> 6113.199
that's then it might be related to the

6108.8 --> 6113.1990000000005
previous civilization then

6115.04 --> 6118.92
oh see there you go yeah it is an

6116.88 --> 6122.88
interesting subject isn't it flatter and

6118.92 --> 6126.28
I've been like sitting on this for a for

6122.88 --> 6129.119
like two weeks or something started

6126.28 --> 6131.08
talking about it like two days ago

6129.119 --> 6133.04
roughly like I'm sitting on this there's

6131.08 --> 6136.599
something here there's like

6133.04 --> 6139.159
an a palpable mystery that's like not

6136.599 --> 6142.159000000001
been figured

6139.159 --> 6147.48
out the catacombs are just staring Us in

6142.159 --> 6150.799999999999
the face and we don't know how how that

6147.48 --> 6150.799999999999
happened and

6155.56 --> 6164.819
why what hello Robert thorn

6161.72 --> 6164.819
[Music]

6174.88 --> 6181.08
Taran mountain range that runs to the

6178.56 --> 6184.080000000001
North

6181.08 --> 6184.08
Center

6185.679 --> 6191.76
what

6187.32 --> 6194.5199999999995
sep Trion nalia wow that is quite the

6191.76 --> 6194.52
confuted

6196.32 --> 6203.4
name but if you're talking about like uh

6200.32 --> 6206.679
pre 7076

6203.4 --> 6209.159
tartaria America yeah absolutely I mean

6206.679 --> 6212.4800000000005
there's like a Chinese wall in

6209.159 --> 6212.48
California and

6217.8 --> 6224.4400000000005
Washington and there were like massive

6220.92 --> 6226.84
amounts of Chinese in California back

6224.44 --> 6229.759999999999
then like in the beginning of

6226.84 --> 6234.400000000001
7076 they were supposed

6229.76 --> 6237.159000000001
laborers but I think that they were

6234.4 --> 6238.799999999999
natives that basically that have lived

6237.159 --> 6241.28
there for like a hundred years or

6238.8 --> 6245.28
something or

6241.28 --> 6245.28
more probably a couple of

6250.52 --> 6256.76
generations Sphinx in the

6254.32 --> 6258.5199999999995
what what do you mean a sphinx in the

6256.76 --> 6259.92
Grand Canyon what are you talking about

6258.52 --> 6261.84
I've never heard of that

6259.92 --> 6266.2390000000005
one that's

6261.84 --> 6266.2390000000005
crazy what Spinx

6278.91 --> 6284.22
[Music]

6289.71 --> 6292.84
[Music]

6293.159 --> 6296.04
city called

6296.639 --> 6299.639
hen

6302.56 --> 6310.4800000000005
okay SL

6304.52 --> 6310.4800000000005
SP okay sure Robert but where

6311.199 --> 6317.119
though hey Bill night of s good to see

6314.119 --> 6317.119
you

6330.96 --> 6333.96
for

6347.57 --> 6350.688999999999
[Music]

6358.24 --> 6361.398999999999
[Music]

6366.52 --> 6369.559
[Music]

6383.639 --> 6389.679
now I made some

6385.28 --> 6389.679
elaboration on the title

6441.599 --> 6447.52
what hm

6444.239 --> 6447.5199999999995
yeah the typical flut

6452.44 --> 6457.08
stage but that's really weird Robert

6462.599 --> 6469.679
torik I mean that sounds like I've heard

6467.159 --> 6473.96
like theorists like that before that say

6469.679 --> 6473.96
that America was actually

6479.28 --> 6485.88
like reference in the Bible it's very

6482.52 --> 6487.159000000001
strange I mean like oh Benjamin had this

6485.88 --> 6490.36
guy

6487.159 --> 6493.44
on that's like from Florida that said

6490.36 --> 6495.679
like Oh The Cedars here are like those

6493.44 --> 6497.32
are exactly the type of Cedars from the

6495.679 --> 6498.36
Bible and this is the only place they

6497.32 --> 6500.92
are

6498.36 --> 6504.04
at it's

6500.92 --> 6507.81
weird I mean who am I to just say like h

6504.04 --> 6510.859
no way but I mean it is just weird

6507.81 --> 6510.859
[Music]

6518.48 --> 6524.44
though frates River and the Colorado

6521.44 --> 6524.44
River

6556.0 --> 6561.04
how do rivers turn themselves off well

6559.199 --> 6563.5199999999995
what causes the rivers in the first

6561.04 --> 6566.159
place right

6563.52 --> 6569.159000000001
I mean the official story oh my God

6566.159 --> 6570.04
these flies just want to be killed by me

6569.159 --> 6574.759999999999
don't

6570.04 --> 6574.76
they where the [ __ ] are they coming

6577.96 --> 6581.719
from seriously where the hell are they

6580.719 --> 6586.08
coming

6581.719 --> 6588.599
from are they coming from the outside or

6586.08 --> 6591.48
something I mean there's no corpse

6588.599 --> 6593.8
rotting anybody anywhere here that I

6591.48 --> 6594.839999999999
know of for all these lies to just pop

6593.8 --> 6598.4400000000005
up out of

6594.84 --> 6598.4400000000005
nowhere [ __ ]

6600.96 --> 6605.44
hell this is freaking

6610.44 --> 6616.32
agitating but yeah Rivers I mean a lot

6614.04 --> 6618.96
of it is like

6616.32 --> 6623.88
from mountainous areas where the

6618.96 --> 6625.88
mountains like draw the water up

6623.88 --> 6628.639
from deep in the ground it's kind of

6625.88 --> 6632.92
weird and so those mountains can just

6628.639 --> 6632.92
kind of like stop

6636.36 --> 6641.92
pumping and then periodically a river

6639.84 --> 6643.8
would dry up it's basically because like

6641.92 --> 6647.56
the flow is suddenly stopping and then

6643.8 --> 6651.679
it's not enough water from rain to even

6647.56 --> 6651.679
properly form that River

6653.639 --> 6656.599
get some fly

6657.28 --> 6662.88
traps no it's not that terrible it's

6660.84 --> 6665.599
just I think it's probably just the

6662.88 --> 6668.639
weather because it's all rainy when it

6665.599 --> 6671.04
gets really rainy in summertime it it

6668.639 --> 6673.28
that happens sometimes very annoying

6671.04 --> 6677.44
though like I just don't know where

6673.28 --> 6677.44
they're suddenly coming from

6684.0 --> 6689.48
most of those dried up Rivers will

6685.96 --> 6689.4800000000005
eventually refill

6690.4 --> 6698.0
yeah but that's probably because the

6695.199 --> 6699.678999999999
mountains that would pump up the water

6698.0 --> 6703.52
from very

6699.679 --> 6706.1990000000005
deep like they might stop and they might

6703.52 --> 6706.1990000000005
start up

6711.04 --> 6715.96
again I mean if there's like suddenly

6713.679 --> 6719.719
Rivers drying up for long periods of

6715.96 --> 6722.719
time and then reinitiating

6719.719 --> 6722.719
I

6723.159 --> 6728.119
mean it would have to be something like

6725.76 --> 6730.639
that you can't just say like oh well

6728.119 --> 6733.119
suddenly it's just not raining there

6730.639 --> 6734.52
anymore at all and that's why there's no

6733.119 --> 6737.5199999999995
more River I

6734.52 --> 6737.52
mean

6738.0 --> 6742.639
no that's very unlikely

6771.199 --> 6774.44
they left the apartment

6774.56 --> 6779.280000000001
yeah yeah well flatter say I certainly

6777.48 --> 6781.32
don't take it as a good sign when

6779.28 --> 6783.04
there's suddenly flies wanting to hang

6781.32 --> 6786.5599999999995
around it's just I don't really know

6783.04 --> 6786.56
what I did to deserve all

6786.84 --> 6790.96
that I'm not doing that

6792.079 --> 6797.639
bad I don't feel miserable

6809.44 --> 6816.598999999999
although yeah maybe because of the

6812.52 --> 6816.599
weather but I mean that's just a vicious

6818.719 --> 6825.28
circle I'm actively trying not to feel

6822.36 --> 6828.598999999999
miserable because of all the crap in the

6825.28 --> 6828.599
world and the weather

6828.719 --> 6835.4800000000005
and stupid green agenda that just keeps

6831.84 --> 6835.4800000000005
pushing forward forward no matter

6836.199 --> 6840.799999999999
what like no matter even if like

6838.84 --> 6843.119000000001
everybody's against it even if the

6840.8 --> 6846.400000000001
people in politics

6843.119 --> 6850.839999999999
themselves are just against it and it

6846.4 --> 6850.839999999999
just keeps going and it's

6852.4 --> 6860.5199999999995
like are the people in control or is

6856.599 --> 6863.4800000000005
there just some M like some lifeless

6860.52 --> 6865.76
machine that's just riding lines for us

6863.48 --> 6868.04
that's in

6865.76 --> 6870.159000000001
control cuz it's certainly starting to

6868.04 --> 6872.4
feel like that it's just like no this is

6870.159 --> 6875.119
just the script writer of how it's

6872.4 --> 6877.799999999999
supposed to go and people don't get an

6875.119 --> 6882.119
opinion like not even the people in

6877.8 --> 6882.119000000001
politics I'm starting to wonder

6882.679 --> 6889.0
sometimes it's

6885.239 --> 6891.5199999999995
like how would it happen that certain

6889.0 --> 6894.239
policies just become initiated when

6891.52 --> 6897.679
there's literally nobody that actually

6894.239 --> 6901.44
wants it there's some people that might

6897.679 --> 6905.36
side with it because they're making

6901.44 --> 6909.0
money and that's like the only

6905.36 --> 6911.759999999999
reason cuz nobody actually wants it

6909.0 --> 6914.679
nobody actually thinks this a good idea

6911.76 --> 6919.76
it's just some people can make money on

6914.679 --> 6919.76
it on the short run and that's it

6939.599 --> 6945.04
yeah I'm not talking about flies now I'm

6942.119 --> 6947.36
talking about politicians and things

6945.04 --> 6949.04
happening in politics I know it's not a

6947.36 --> 6951.28
lot of different so you could just

6949.04 --> 6954.239
interchange those two subjects and it's

6951.28 --> 6954.239
like oh yeah

6954.28 --> 6959.44
talking about politics yeah they are

6957.0 --> 6959.44
just like

6965.4 --> 6971.36
flies brainwashing is strong especially

6968.199 --> 6973.719
in government yeah but I mean

6971.36 --> 6976.079
brainwashing doesn't mean anything

6973.719 --> 6978.159
unless there's money to be gained right

6976.079 --> 6978.159
I

6978.32 --> 6984.28
mean brainwashing only works if there's

6981.8 --> 6986.400000000001
like a directive that you can follow

6984.28 --> 6989.04
that's going to give you an

6986.4 --> 6991.719
advantage brainwashing just for

6989.04 --> 6993.079
brainwashing sake without an advantage

6991.719 --> 6995.8
to be

6993.079 --> 6997.92
gained through being brainwashed right

6995.8 --> 7000.639
because it's like oh we need to scrub

6997.92 --> 7003.32
our feelings of conscious about what

7000.639 --> 7005.719
we're doing so we can obtain the

7003.32 --> 7007.4
objective right which would be money or

7005.719 --> 7010.96
power or something well if there's no

7007.4 --> 7014.239
money or power in it then like it just

7010.96 --> 7014.2390000000005
doesn't work

7014.56 --> 7019.4400000000005
that's why I'm saying there's still

7016.119 --> 7020.639
people just barely holding on to it

7019.44 --> 7024.678999999999
because there's something they're

7020.639 --> 7024.679
getting out of it probably

7026.96 --> 7034.28
financially but nobody in general thinks

7031.76 --> 7038.88
like this green agenda stuff is a good

7034.28 --> 7038.88
idea nobody like

7045.159 --> 7055.04
except people that are just

7048.44 --> 7055.04
like obsessed with depopulation

7086.52 --> 7091.92
do you think it took

7088.44 --> 7095.48
1700 plus years with First floating L to

7091.92 --> 7100.76
figure out to fly put air in bigger bag

7095.48 --> 7104.0
no Robert Thorn that no absolutely

7100.76 --> 7107.88
not I'm quite confident that hot air

7104.0 --> 7107.88
balloons would have been figured out in

7109.76 --> 7115.639
Antiquity I mean they may not have

7112.079 --> 7119.199
perfected it but they certain like

7115.639 --> 7121.719
what's stopping a bunch of

7119.199 --> 7124.32
Nomads seriously what's stopping a bunch

7121.719 --> 7127.719
of Nomads from just putting a whole

7124.32 --> 7133.36
bunch of animal skins

7127.719 --> 7133.36
together making it into a giant bag

7134.76 --> 7142.96
and then like filling it up with hot air

7138.88 --> 7144.92
or smoke or whatever till it

7142.96 --> 7148.52
just starts

7144.92 --> 7149.92
to be a balloon and then like lift off

7148.52 --> 7152.4800000000005
for a bit I

7149.92 --> 7154.56
mean they probably never really

7152.48 --> 7158.48
perfected it but I'm pretty damn sure

7154.56 --> 7162.96
that somebody in Antiquity launch

7158.48 --> 7166.638999999999
themselves in like an archaic balloon

7162.96 --> 7166.639
I mean why wouldn't you do

7166.84 --> 7173.52
that it's not like you really need Super

7170.199 --> 7176.44
complicated materials to do

7173.52 --> 7178.639
it I mean you need complicated materials

7176.44 --> 7181.04
if you want it to be like an industrial

7178.639 --> 7184.400000000001
device that can just hang in the air

7181.04 --> 7187.04
forever right but just to get off the

7184.4 --> 7190.4
ground with a balloon like that I mean

7187.04 --> 7193.719
it doesn't take a lot of technology to

7190.4 --> 7193.719
do that

7205.04 --> 7213.119
7083 the first one we know well that's

7208.119 --> 7213.119
just the official story letter Sage I

7213.719 --> 7220.0
mean floating lanterns

7217.04 --> 7222.84
yeah so Ser like seriously if you just

7220.0 --> 7224.599
think about it what somebody's um weirdo

7222.84 --> 7227.32
Chinese

7224.599 --> 7229.400000000001
person what's them what's going to stop

7227.32 --> 7232.32
them from just like I'm going to make a

7229.4 --> 7236.44
floating ladn that's

7232.32 --> 7237.799999999999
like 10 times the normal size and I'm

7236.44 --> 7241.44
going to write

7237.8 --> 7246.119000000001
it I'm going to sit on

7241.44 --> 7247.839999999999
it and probably die because they didn't

7246.119 --> 7251.28
have parachutes

7247.84 --> 7253.32
yet but I mean that doesn't mean that

7251.28 --> 7256.719
somebody would be crazy enough to just

7253.32 --> 7256.719
do it anyway

7262.27 --> 7265.479
[Music]

7277.94 --> 7281.099999999999
[Music]

7284.719 --> 7287.719
what

7324.22 --> 7328.22
[Music]

7337.679 --> 7347.52
okay modification to the title

7342.8 --> 7347.52
again to perfect it

7348.27 --> 7351.319
[Music]

7374.079 --> 7382.96
anyway yeah thanks Robert thnik for for

7377.679 --> 7385.599
showing up here and very interesting

7382.96 --> 7389.4
input hope to see you more

7385.599 --> 7392.96
often sound like an interesting person

7389.4 --> 7397.638999999999
to have these discussions with so you're

7392.96 --> 7397.639
always very welcome to show up here

7409.8 --> 7413.52
interesting at first

7428.8 --> 7434.400000000001
what you can be a bit much or well

7431.8 --> 7434.400000000001
welcome to the

7437.52 --> 7443.119000000001
club but we have a whole range of people

7440.4 --> 7445.48
here that can be a bit much and

7443.119 --> 7447.88
then there's days where it's just a

7445.48 --> 7447.879999999999
giant

7449.92 --> 7455.2390000000005
mess but Today's Show is a good show

7452.48 --> 7458.04
yesterday's show was pretty good as well

7455.239 --> 7462.159
day before that not so much because I

7458.04 --> 7465.88
mean i' I've been doing this every day

7462.159 --> 7468.5199999999995
for almost a decade now and yeah I have

7465.88 --> 7470.92
mood swings and sometimes it just

7468.52 --> 7474.040000000001
doesn't work I do the show and then it

7470.92 --> 7476.04
just sucks I just sit there cranky and

7474.04 --> 7480.599
silent I don't really know what to

7476.04 --> 7483.559
comment about people talk about generic

7480.599 --> 7485.76
nonsense and it just pisses me off and

7483.559 --> 7488.28
then nothing really happens except I'm

7485.76 --> 7491.88
cranky and that's it and then the trolls

7488.28 --> 7493.599
make their stupid ass videos about me

7491.88 --> 7496.679
pretending like that's the only thing

7493.599 --> 7499.679
that ever happens at at the early bird

7496.679 --> 7502.04
show and then I move on and then another

7499.679 --> 7506.52
good show

7502.04 --> 7506.5199999999995
happens so that's kind of how that goes

7515.28 --> 7522.4
here what's the main aspect of the page

7519.4 --> 7522.4
what

7522.559 --> 7525.119000000001
what what do you

7534.92 --> 7543.04
mean the main aspects are the subjects

7539.44 --> 7543.04
that I talk about

7555.119 --> 7558.5199999999995
man lost

7558.719 --> 7563.96
technology dude borders Bo I think that

7561.679 --> 7566.1990000000005
in really ancient times in times where

7563.96 --> 7570.2390000000005
the pyramids were actually

7566.199 --> 7572.839999999999
effective like Tesla

7570.239 --> 7576.919999999999
Tech yeah I think that there were just

7572.84 --> 7576.92
like hovering ships

7588.679 --> 7593.4800000000005
I mean I made that drawing I'll just

7591.36 --> 7597.598999999999
show that drawing again to give you an

7593.48 --> 7597.598999999999
indication of what I think was

7604.8 --> 7609.159000000001
there where is it

7631.44 --> 7634.28
a good old

7634.719 --> 7639.36
sketch it's kind of old

7644.079 --> 7647.679
right but uh

7648.119 --> 7654.4
yeah floating giant

7651.28 --> 7657.4
structures that could even like charge

7654.4 --> 7657.4
themselves over

7669.28 --> 7676.5199999999995
pyramids Temple of Sol MO the one that

7672.239 --> 7679.48
fell three still what wow I never

7676.52 --> 7680.8
thought of it like that Robert Thorndike

7679.48 --> 7683.119
that's very

7680.8 --> 7684.96
interesting you think that those temples

7683.119 --> 7689.28
were

7684.96 --> 7689.28
flying that's Epic

7726.559 --> 7731.96
man it just makes me think like where

7728.52 --> 7734.2390000000005
were they from then

7731.96 --> 7737.159
could like the original flying cities

7734.239 --> 7738.079
like were they really made from scratch

7737.159 --> 7741.28
by

7738.079 --> 7743.0
people or was it like part of the

7741.28 --> 7746.199
original

7743.0 --> 7749.159
design by the designer of the realm like

7746.199 --> 7752.079
were there just these flying vessels

7749.159 --> 7755.5199999999995
close to Heaven were they hijacked by

7752.079 --> 7759.44
humans did humans just like hijack this

7755.52 --> 7759.4400000000005
infrastructure that somebody

7759.559 --> 7764.719
Master figure out

7762.119 --> 7767.679
how to take control over these flying

7764.719 --> 7769.36
cities that were just there from the

7767.679 --> 7772.84
start

7769.36 --> 7775.199
right I mean is there any kind of record

7772.84 --> 7777.559
of a

7775.199 --> 7782.32
construction of a flying

7777.559 --> 7785.76
City like we're building it it took off

7782.32 --> 7787.84
is there any story even about that or is

7785.76 --> 7790.320000000001
it just like no these things were just

7787.84 --> 7794.32
always there they were there from the

7790.32 --> 7797.32
beginning and they fought some of them

7794.32 --> 7797.32
crashed

7810.599 --> 7816.96
right so yeah flying palaces and all

7813.48 --> 7820.48
that I'm just asking were they always

7816.96 --> 7822.159
there from the start as in like oh Adam

7820.48 --> 7824.0
Eve are made there there and like oh

7822.159 --> 7826.0
walking Paradise like oh yeah there's

7824.0 --> 7828.92
the flying

7826.0 --> 7831.679
castles maybe they were literally always

7828.92 --> 7831.679
there from the

7834.88 --> 7842.52
start and then men just figured out how

7838.92 --> 7842.52
to hijack what was

7846.079 --> 7851.759999999999
there everything came from something no

7849.32 --> 7855.639
yeah but everything is designed but

7851.76 --> 7855.639
who's to say that men made

7855.76 --> 7860.92
it what if they were just there maybe

7859.0 --> 7864.52
they were like

7860.92 --> 7866.4800000000005
Angelic pit stops going to say it in a

7864.52 --> 7868.159000000001
silly way but who knows maybe they were

7866.48 --> 7870.44
just like the flying vessels and they

7868.159 --> 7873.159
were like in between stations for the

7870.44 --> 7873.159
Angels or

7874.4 --> 7881.5199999999995
something pit

7877.44 --> 7884.759999999999
stops and then eventually the angel stop

7881.52 --> 7887.8
coming and then men figured out a way to

7884.76 --> 7890.96
like get control of those things and

7887.8 --> 7890.96
actually use them as

7894.239 --> 7899.4
Vehicles what if I told you we found a

7897.36 --> 7902.28
computer not made I would not be

7899.4 --> 7906.879999999999
surprised one bit Robert Tor

7902.28 --> 7911.4
like there's like tons of even science

7906.88 --> 7911.400000000001
fiction that tells you that

7912.199 --> 7917.638999999999
like oh we found a computer from the

7914.52 --> 7920.040000000001
future like yeah there's a lot of

7917.639 --> 7922.52
different movies alone that basically

7920.04 --> 7922.5199999999995
use

7923.8 --> 7928.8
that oh how did you get such a

7926.44 --> 7932.598999999999
revolutionary computer design yeah we

7928.8 --> 7932.599
got it from the future

7941.92 --> 7947.2390000000005
the gods fought wars in the air with in

7945.159 --> 7951.28
the

7947.239 --> 7951.28
VIIs gods or the

7954.0 --> 7958.48
Angels right so maybe yeah maybe it does

7956.76 --> 7960.079000000001
make sense maybe they were like the

7958.48 --> 7966.36
fanas were

7960.079 --> 7966.36
like stations Pit Stop stations for the

7966.559 --> 7974.0
Angels then the Rebellion happened and

7969.76 --> 7974.0
suddenly they became war

7977.4 --> 7982.48
vehicles then the war probably ended at

7980.36 --> 7986.639
some

7982.48 --> 7990.678999999999
point the rebellious Angels were cast to

7986.639 --> 7992.639
Earth their fanas destroyed and then the

7990.679 --> 7996.4400000000005
rest

7992.639 --> 7999.079
abandoned or they returned up there who

7996.44 --> 8001.48
knows dude it could be this sounds kind

7999.079 --> 8004.639
of crazy perhaps

8001.48 --> 8007.598999999999
but uh maybe the flying cities are still

8004.639 --> 8010.84
there maybe they're still up there

8007.599 --> 8014.1990000000005
they're just so high up that there is no

8010.84 --> 8014.1990000000005
way to detect or see

8018.36 --> 8024.92
them or yeah could get all star cing on

8022.4 --> 8028.0
you maybe they're cloaked you just can't

8024.92 --> 8033.04
detect them even if you could see

8028.0 --> 8033.04
them or if you had the range for it

8033.36 --> 8038.799999999999
right or maybe they return through the

8036.28 --> 8043.079
ceiling exit to the other layer the

8038.8 --> 8044.96
other Heavenly realm layer and they're

8043.079 --> 8047.96
just like that's where they're hanging

8044.96 --> 8047.96
around

8072.96 --> 8080.559
yeah Robert Thor like wasn't it like a

8074.96 --> 8080.559
Vana was found in a mountain in Tibet or

8082.36 --> 8088.679
something like I heard that story before

8085.76 --> 8092.639
that there was a giant flying vessel

8088.679 --> 8095.599
found in Tibet

8092.639 --> 8099.52
like in the 20th century even and then

8095.599 --> 8099.52
they just kept it completely

8101.599 --> 8105.639
secret in the 90s

8117.36 --> 8125.0
right what in Japan every few years

8121.0 --> 8125.0
floating islands appear here the

8125.52 --> 8128.84
what what

8129.079 --> 8134.679
the I've never heard of that one borders

8131.76 --> 8134.679
boy that is just

8137.28 --> 8140.92
weird I mean

8141.88 --> 8148.92
cool I mean floating islands is like the

8144.719 --> 8148.92
coolest thing I could imagine

8151.719 --> 8154.92
but where the like

8155.36 --> 8163.199
what it's long

8158.199 --> 8163.199
video what are you talking about

8183.119 --> 8185.839999999999
never heard of

8198.809 --> 8205.229
[Music]

8206.399 --> 8213.88
that yeah that ain't

8208.76 --> 8213.880000000001
working my YouTube search did not

8216.24 --> 8221.559
result it's just Minecraft and other

8238.24 --> 8245.0
nonsense so yeah there's videos of about

8241.08 --> 8245.0
it well there's no videos that I can

8245.24 --> 8251.88
find borders boy so uh yeah unless you'd

8249.359 --> 8253.800000000001
like to link me up somehow through the

8251.88 --> 8256.479
email or

8253.8 --> 8260.279999999999
whatever I have no

8256.479 --> 8262.84
idea what you're talking about cuz

8260.28 --> 8268.479000000001
YouTube search results certainly don't

8262.84 --> 8268.479
give me any videos of flying Islands

8279.28 --> 8283.880000000001
it's buried oh okay

8325.16 --> 8330.23
be nice to Google well that's not going

8327.08 --> 8338.489
to work

8330.23 --> 8338.489
[Music]

8341.719 --> 8348.839999999998
I mean all you get in the results is

8344.28 --> 8348.84
just a bunch of video game stuff

8374.639 --> 8386.119999999999
what some weirdo actually has a startup

8378.88 --> 8386.119999999999
to build a floating Japan Japanese City

8388.16 --> 8393.68
really this is ridiculous for

8421.12 --> 8425.92
so yeah I don't know what you're talking

8423.08 --> 8428.479
about but there's no search results for

8425.92 --> 8428.479
this at

8434.56 --> 8439.519999999999
all I just shared one no you

8442.6 --> 8449.479000000001
didn't in the early Bridge oh

8446.92 --> 8451.92
okay right okay I'll check that out

8449.479 --> 8457.519999999999
Giant

8451.92 --> 8457.52
SE yeah that's over China That's not

8460.439 --> 8465.2
Japan yeah I remember

8463.0 --> 8468.2
that that's a

8465.2 --> 8468.2
hologram

8473.359 --> 8479.960000000001
literally like that's

8476.68 --> 8482.04
admitted it's a hologram they have very

8479.96 --> 8485.08
elaborate holographic

8482.04 --> 8488.28
technology that they've used to test and

8485.08 --> 8488.28
this was one of those

8488.88 --> 8495.16
tests got the country wrong right I

8492.0 --> 8497.6
guess you did because I remember the

8495.16 --> 8500.76
Holograms in

8497.6 --> 8504.960000000001
China those are Holograms they have that

8500.76 --> 8504.960000000001
technology to do that

8519.16 --> 8523.119999999999
right that's 21st century

8523.64 --> 8528.439

a Japanese Atlantis off the coast

8763.24 --> 8770.319
underwater what what are you talking

8765.64 --> 8770.319
about never heard of that

8783.08 --> 8787.0
Japanese underwater

8789.12 --> 8797.800000000001
city BBC Travel oh goody stupid

8794.2 --> 8801.279
agreeable [ __ ] wow yeah that looks

8797.8 --> 8801.278999999999
pretty amazing

8812.04 --> 8816.479000000001
it does look like a monolithic

8821.52 --> 8827.720000000001
structure oh yes thank you thank you for

8824.72 --> 8829.599999999999
telling us how you think they built it

8827.72 --> 8834.08
back then oh so

8829.6 --> 8836.56
helpful so helpful mainstream BBC

8834.08 --> 8838.92
interpretation of the megalithic

8836.56 --> 8843.399
architecture is so

8838.92 --> 8843.399
helpful so gaslighting at

8846.16 --> 8849.72
all amazing

8852.76 --> 8862.04
though I'll just share this with

8856.479 --> 8862.039999999999
you CU it does have really good footage

8869.19 --> 8872.79
[Music]

8881.92 --> 8886.279
seriously you just want to

8889.319 --> 8896.0
die what the [ __ ] is wrong with these

8892.56 --> 8898.64
[ __ ] Flies why do they come in my

8896.0 --> 8902.12
face all the [ __ ]

8898.64 --> 8902.119999999999
time why

8929.04 --> 8933.080000000002
yeah e

8971.319 --> 8975.88
yeah flatter said yeah I get that

8981.92 --> 8988.56
totally yeah that was my response

8985.52 --> 8993.960000000001
too like oh yeah you know all these

8988.56 --> 8993.96
things oh yes yeah yeah sure you

8997.64 --> 9004.319
do oh you know what tools they were

9001.279 --> 9008.319000000001
using I'm sure you

9004.319 --> 9008.319
do right

9027.2 --> 9031.720000000001
trees been found petrified many layers

9029.72 --> 9034.72
standing up

9031.72 --> 9036.84
yeah no but petrification is an

9034.72 --> 9040.039999999999
incredibly rapid

9036.84 --> 9044.92
process it can literally happen in in

9040.04 --> 9044.92
just months if the conditions are

9046.52 --> 9053.92
right and the entire idea of sediment

9050.439 --> 9053.92
layers is absolute

9054.52 --> 9063.08
nonsense like no it doesn't do that at

9060.16 --> 9065.279
all instead the different layers with

9063.08 --> 9068.399
the supposed different fossils that

9065.279 --> 9072.479000000001
happen in there are much more likely to

9068.399 --> 9076.24
have resulted from one giant

9072.479 --> 9079.319
milrom of water and mud that went around

9076.24 --> 9083.84
and then suddenly settled probably

9079.319 --> 9086.56
vibrating a lot making the more dense

9083.84 --> 9090.08
compacted things within that slush of

9086.56 --> 9093.16
mod and objects go sink down and the

9090.08 --> 9095.76
less dense things float up and that's

9093.16 --> 9097.76
how you have a bunch of trees with the

9095.76 --> 9101.880000000001
roots pointing

9097.76 --> 9101.880000000001
upward stuck within those

9104.8 --> 9111.599999999999
layers cuz it happened all at the same

9109.359 --> 9113.56
time

9111.6 --> 9117.359
and then based on the

9113.56 --> 9120.56
density like formed these layers before

9117.359 --> 9123.0
it hardened and then

9120.56 --> 9127.439
petrified everything that was in those

9123.0 --> 9130.8
layers so it all happened simultaneously

9127.439 --> 9134.2
logically not sedimentary oh it just

9130.8 --> 9137.08
took thousands of millions of years for

9134.2 --> 9140.319000000001
a little layer to form on that because

9137.08 --> 9142.92
that's how that happens except it never

9140.319 --> 9145.8
happens like that

9142.92 --> 9148.92
ever yeah there are no places around the

9145.8 --> 9152.56
world where there is like layers of

9148.92 --> 9155.24
sediment no the only place that happens

9152.56 --> 9160.039999999999
is at river

9155.24 --> 9163.08
banks yeah it's called River clay it's

9160.04 --> 9166.92
water basically carving

9163.08 --> 9168.92
out dust from the mountains making it

9166.92 --> 9173.16
form Clay and they're kind of like

9168.92 --> 9176.359
dragging it along the river path forming

9173.16 --> 9179.92
sediment called River clay like that's

9176.359 --> 9183.04
the sediment that actually happens yeah

9179.92 --> 9186.359
dust just doesn't like gather over the

9183.04 --> 9187.76
ages and then form another layer that's

9186.359 --> 9190.56
absolute

9187.76 --> 9193.64
horeshit is the

9190.56 --> 9196.16
worst like non most nonsensical

9193.64 --> 9201.76
geological conclusion that's ever been

9196.16 --> 9201.76
drawn in that field total nonsense

9204.76 --> 9212.92
right yeah and swamps that's true plants

9208.8 --> 9215.759999999998
plants can swamps can like create Peete

9212.92 --> 9218.04
and all that but that's all because of

9215.76 --> 9221.399
organic

9218.04 --> 9224.0
activity all of it like sedimentary

9221.399 --> 9229.358999999999
layers happen due to

9224.0 --> 9231.479
Rivers carrying the grounded mountain in

9229.359 --> 9235.880000000001
the for a river Cay and dust and

9231.479 --> 9239.24
dragging it along and plants living and

9235.88 --> 9241.8
dying in such a place and then that

9239.24 --> 9245.439
stuff just compacts and then compacts

9241.8 --> 9249.519999999999
more and then you get Peete and all

9245.439 --> 9253.68
that that's it like that's the only

9249.52 --> 9253.68
sedimentary layers that actually

9254.16 --> 9262.08
happen yeah there's no water no rivers

9257.92 --> 9264.6
or anything like no sedimentary it just

9262.08 --> 9264.6
doesn't

9288.08 --> 9291.64
happen right

9292.84 --> 9298.76
millions of years

9295.68 --> 9300.64
apart yeah based on absolutely nothing I

9298.76 --> 9304.24
mean it's a vicious circle the entire

9300.64 --> 9309.358999999999
fossil record with the layers is a

9304.24 --> 9311.96
vicious circle reasoning circular

9309.359 --> 9314.12
reasoning right they know how old the

9311.96 --> 9317.96
fossil is by the layer it is

9314.12 --> 9320.6
in they know how old the layer is by the

9317.96 --> 9324.24
fossil they found in it

9320.6 --> 9327.52
in other words they have no knowledge of

9324.24 --> 9330.279
any time scale with any of the layers or

9327.52 --> 9330.279
the fossils

9330.6 --> 9336.479000000001
whatsoever it's more likely that it all

9333.319 --> 9336.479
happened rather

9339.319 --> 9343.08
quickly due to a

9344.279 --> 9350.52
flood sudden flash flood lots of

9347.68 --> 9353.0
turbulence lots of mod and stuff and

9350.52 --> 9357.640000000001
wood and dead animals and living animals

9353.0 --> 9360.12
getting dragged around in a giant

9357.64 --> 9361.96
storm and then suddenly the water

9360.12 --> 9365.12
receding and then everything just

9361.96 --> 9368.64
muddying up in these layers and then

9365.12 --> 9372.479000000001
drying up and solidifying like that's

9368.64 --> 9374.84
what caused these layers in the fossil

9372.479 --> 9377.358999999999
records like that's how that would have

9374.84 --> 9380.399
happened that's how fossils could be

9377.359 --> 9383.359
made yeah the fossil

9380.399 --> 9386.399
can only be formed if

9383.359 --> 9389.800000000001
it's suspended underwater and then

9386.399 --> 9393.479
deprived of oxygen so that it can't

9389.8 --> 9396.519999999999
rot and then it's going to petrify like

9393.479 --> 9398.24
that's the unique condition that that is

9396.52 --> 9403.2
required for

9398.24 --> 9405.96
petrification sudden burial sudden not

9403.2 --> 9409.640000000001
gradually over time sudden

9405.96 --> 9411.679999999998
burial deprived from oxygen then

9409.64 --> 9414.16
petrification which happens rapidly

9411.68 --> 9417.68
that's how petrification happens it does

9414.16 --> 9422.05
not happen over millions of

9417.68 --> 9425.93
years yeah that's absolute

9422.05 --> 9425.929999999998
[Music]

9428.6 --> 9435.92
nonsense yeah so much I've

9432.319 --> 9437.76
learned over the decades about this a

9435.92 --> 9440.359
lot of this information also I learned

9437.76 --> 9442.52
from Kent hovind

9440.359 --> 9444.960000000001
there's proof of this [ __ ] I mean

9442.52 --> 9447.24
there's people have

9444.96 --> 9449.759999999998
found in

9447.24 --> 9454.96
swamps they like

9449.76 --> 9459.319
find petrified boots with a foot in the

9454.96 --> 9462.039999999999
boot with a bone sticking out the boot

9459.319 --> 9463.199999999999
the foot and the bone in the foot all

9462.04 --> 9466.399000000001
being

9463.2 --> 9469.800000000001
petrified like oh but it's millions of

9466.399 --> 9474.479
years old boot with a foot in there I'm

9469.8 --> 9478.84
sure it's millions of years old or it's

9474.479 --> 9483.519999999999
literally like a wounded person or their

9478.84 --> 9486.479
leg got broken or shot shot off and cut

9483.52 --> 9488.720000000001
it they cut it off to prevent Gang Green

9486.479 --> 9491.438999999998
threw it in the swamp it sank down and

9488.72 --> 9492.358999999999
then it petrified and it probably didn't

9491.439 --> 9496.359
even

9492.359 --> 9500.04
happen like it just happened like 200

9496.359 --> 9503.6
years ago probably right

9500.04 --> 9503.6
not millions of years

9512.92 --> 9519.399
ago Cowboy foot oh you we're talking

9516.16 --> 9524.96
about the same thing right yeah that

9519.399 --> 9530.439
one Cowboy foot in a boot from 50s

9524.96 --> 9530.438999999998
exactly we're talking synchronous here

9537.96 --> 9543.358999999999
didn't know that fossilization happened

9539.88 --> 9546.92
that far dude there's people that

9543.359 --> 9549.08
literally petrify things as a hobby just

9546.92 --> 9552.279
oh I have a thing oh you want it

9549.08 --> 9556.16
petrified okay I'll petrify it for you

9552.279 --> 9556.16
come back in 3 weeks

9571.359 --> 9577.12
right because you can create the exact

9574.359 --> 9580.0
conditions for petrification rapidly you

9577.12 --> 9583.68
can make those conditions artificially

9580.0 --> 9586.72
and then actively petrify things as a

9583.68 --> 9588.0
hobby if you think that's cool you can

9586.72 --> 9591.358999999999
just do

9588.0 --> 9594.359
that you could even choose with what

9591.359 --> 9596.720000000001
type of mineral or Crystal the object's

9594.359 --> 9596.720000000001
going to

9597.0 --> 9602.359
petrify it's literally been elevated to

9599.96 --> 9604.16
like an art form by some of these people

9602.359 --> 9607.16
out

9604.16 --> 9609.92
there like theoretically you could like

9607.16 --> 9611.16
oh I got an accident I lost my hand or

9609.92 --> 9613.960000000001
something

9611.16 --> 9616.92
terrible and then you take that dead

9613.96 --> 9620.679999999998
hand and you just go to the guy and just

9616.92 --> 9622.24
say could you petrify my hand

9620.68 --> 9626.399
like oh yeah

9622.24 --> 9629.359
sure and then you have a petrified hand

9626.399 --> 9629.358999999999
that you lost one

9630.2 --> 9634.08
time I mean that is kind of an

9632.279 --> 9637.319000000001
interesting way to preserve something

9634.08 --> 9637.319
like that

9654.56 --> 9661.278999999999
yeah flatter Sage you don't understand

9657.279 --> 9663.24
why they say that they don't know no but

9661.279 --> 9666.92
they don't

9663.24 --> 9671.08
deny that fossilization can happen very

9666.92 --> 9671.08
fast it's just they don't think it

9675.279 --> 9680.84
did it's like yeah yeah fossilization

9678.0 --> 9685.2
can happen very fast but all these

9680.84 --> 9687.880000000001
fossil records that took a long time why

9685.2 --> 9690.479000000001
because that's how this story is

9687.88 --> 9692.759999999998
constructed we're just assuming it took

9690.479 --> 9694.76
a long time in this case even though

9692.76 --> 9697.68
it's been demonstrated petrification can

9694.76 --> 9701.08
happen very quickly yeah that's cool it

9697.68 --> 9703.800000000001
can happen very quickly but we think

9701.08 --> 9706.52
because that's what the story says that

9703.8 --> 9709.96
the old fossils and the sedimentary

9706.52 --> 9713.319000000001
layers took a very long time

9709.96 --> 9717.199999999999
why because that's the story not based

9713.319 --> 9720.039999999999
on any actual physical evidence or

9717.2 --> 9724.04
demonstrations but that's the story so

9720.04 --> 9724.04
that's how we're going to tell it

9740.92 --> 9748.319
most

9742.68 --> 9748.319
Maps no Australia only oania

9749.52 --> 9756.08
what what are you talking

9752.76 --> 9756.08
about what

9766.64 --> 9771.119999999999
Maps send reference

9772.359 --> 9777.800000000001
Discord uh you can send me an

9781.88 --> 9787.56
email send it to Arwin 33@gmail.com

9789.08 --> 9795.56
and I'll check it out sounds interesting

9825.08 --> 9829.399
right anyway I hope everybody's enjoying

9826.68 --> 9833.399
the show

9829.399 --> 9833.399
very interesting thus far

9871.84 --> 9876.72
as an Australian what what are you

9874.16 --> 9880.72
talking about as an Australian you're an

9876.72 --> 9880.72
Australian what

9889.359 --> 9892.16
what are you talking

9917.2 --> 9925.279
about dual sh ship oh

9922.279 --> 9925.279
huh

9925.64 --> 9929.24
okay I had no

9931.64 --> 9941.96
idea hello LG good to see you only

9937.359 --> 9945.720000000001
89° is that hot I don't

9941.96 --> 9947.9
know cuz I don't know Fahrenheit and

9945.72 --> 9951.41
what any of that means

9947.9 --> 9951.41
[Music]

9967.56 --> 9977.359
I just know it's

9971.2 --> 9977.359
raining raining all the time oh

9977.76 --> 9983.08
goody yeah it's raining all the

9984.479 --> 9988.76
time yeah the weather sucks out

10006.319 --> 10010.319
there oana

10010.88 --> 10017.96
okay so they call it

10014.96 --> 10017.96
oana

10019.24 --> 10022.96
oania it's a bit

10023.96 --> 10030.0
odd but to be

10026.279 --> 10031.479000000001
fair Oceania I guess that it is the name

10030.0 --> 10034.64
of the

10031.479 --> 10037.08
continent well the name of the nation

10034.64 --> 10037.08
would be

10037.439 --> 10042.800000000001
Australia oh see

10039.8 --> 10047.679999999998
would include New Zealand and perhaps

10042.8 --> 10052.479
even Papua New gu Guinea and all of

10047.68 --> 10052.479000000001
that so I think that that's what that's

10055.6 --> 10061.2
about no this Greenland is a name yeah

10058.439 --> 10064.08
well because I mean this thing that you

10061.2 --> 10067.439
sent me is the

10064.08 --> 10070.439
names are of the oceans and of the

10067.439 --> 10070.439
continents

10071.0 --> 10076.52
Australia is not a continent that's the

10073.76 --> 10076.52
name of the

10078.64 --> 10087.8
nation named after the god OAS I'm sure

10082.64 --> 10087.8
it is I mean Europe is also a a God

10088.56 --> 10092.56
name so

10106.12 --> 10111.2
but I mean yeah I guess that's that's

10109.2 --> 10113.240000000002
why thank you for sending them I'll I'll

10111.2 --> 10117.880000000001
share it with you

10113.24 --> 10117.88
guys soon as the email gets

10124.92 --> 10128.92
it what

10131.439 --> 10136.800000000001
okay so yeah

10134.08 --> 10140.0
that's what it

10136.8 --> 10143.96
shows can zoom

10140.0 --> 10148.76
in oania but here

10143.96 --> 10151.519999999999
Asia Europe Africa that's the name of

10148.76 --> 10154.16
continents Australia is the name of the

10151.52 --> 10160.0
the country not of the

10154.16 --> 10160.0
continent so I guess that that explains

10166.16 --> 10171.279
it explains it to me

10168.64 --> 10175.239
anyway then why is it called Australia

10171.279 --> 10177.239
most Maps because the nation is called

10175.239 --> 10180.359
Australia right I mean if they're going

10177.239 --> 10184.16
to point out oh look Asia here is

10180.359 --> 10188.239
comprised of Russia China

10184.16 --> 10190.479
Mongolia India Pakistan blah blah blah

10188.239 --> 10193.96
blah blah all of that

10190.479 --> 10196.519999999999
right and look over there is Australia

10193.96 --> 10198.479
yeah that's why but in this case it's

10196.52 --> 10202.319000000001
like

10198.479 --> 10205.319
Asia well Australia is part of the

10202.319 --> 10205.319
continent of

10210.399 --> 10217.358999999999
Oceania why don't they teach that in

10214.439 --> 10222.16
school because they're too busy trying

10217.359 --> 10224.08
to teach people that 2 + 2 equal 5 I

10222.16 --> 10228.399
don't

10224.08 --> 10228.399
know I don't know why they teach

10229.279 --> 10236.04
that I think I remember from geography

10232.68 --> 10239.0
school that they did actually teach me

10236.04 --> 10241.800000000001
that they said like yeah the Nations

10239.0 --> 10244.76
called Australia the continent called

10241.8 --> 10246.119999999999
Oceania yes the continent mostly the

10244.76 --> 10250.64
nation of

10246.12 --> 10250.640000000001
Australia but that's just how this works

Antarctica okay

10352.84 --> 10355.04
all

10362.359 --> 10368.279
right I'm interested in like the Giant

10365.64 --> 10370.239
mountain range that's below Oceania

10368.279 --> 10372.16
there

10370.239 --> 10376.479
right I mean we all know about like the

10372.16 --> 10378.8
whole sort of Island Peak thing that

10376.479 --> 10380.84
sticks out near South

10378.8 --> 10382.8
America that's like the place you're

10380.84 --> 10384.6
allowed to go right that's the part of

10382.8 --> 10387.08
Antarctica where you're allowed to go

10384.6 --> 10389.2
where all the penguins are and all that

10387.08 --> 10393.76
but what about on the other

10389.2 --> 10399.2
side like supposedly straight

10393.76 --> 10401.880000000001
below New Zealand like what is that

10399.2 --> 10404.12
what's over there like is there just

10401.88 --> 10406.519999999999
some Giant mountain range just sticking

10404.12 --> 10410.160000000002
out there like what is in that mountain

10406.52 --> 10412.239
range why is it so vast like why is that

10410.16 --> 10415.279
mountain range depicted as if it is like

10412.239 --> 10417.119999999999
the entire size of like three times the

10415.279 --> 10420.239
size of entire

10417.12 --> 10424.04
Australia or it's like the entire span

10420.239 --> 10427.6
of the north of to the

10424.04 --> 10429.399000000001
South like it's the size of chili in its

10427.6 --> 10431.6
entirety something like that like what

10429.399 --> 10433.599999999999
is that what is that mountain range why

10431.6 --> 10437.399000000001
does it show like

10433.6 --> 10439.6
that could somebody show that it's right

10437.399 --> 10442.8
against the ocean could somebody show

10439.6 --> 10445.04
that gigantic mountain range there

10442.8 --> 10448.399
that's sitting right next to the

10445.04 --> 10451.239000000001
ocean south of New Zealand could

10448.399 --> 10454.64
somebody show that where's the photos

Ireland and you have like the redheaded

10649.12 --> 10654.640000000001
people like the

Turks have their own group like

of that one

10729.72 --> 10732.72
huh

10787.04 --> 10791.0
in for

is in fact a sock account oh really how

10823.88 --> 10827.8
would you know you can't check out his

10828.84 --> 10832.52
channel it's a very

10833.76 --> 10838.319
strange thing to say

10860.6 --> 10864.479000000001
they subscribed to a lot of

10875.92 --> 10883.16
people you know who is from oh I'm sure

10880.56 --> 10883.16
sure you

10892.04 --> 10897.12
do so who is he then

10915.64 --> 10921.439

10926.08 --> 10933.08
whatever Canadian government who

10930.6 --> 10935.04
cares I don't really care level with me

10933.08 --> 10938.399
I had an interesting conversation with

10935.04 --> 10938.399000000001
him so

10946.64 --> 10951.599999999999
guns of never own no this guy is

10949.68 --> 10954.68
definitely not that

10951.6 --> 10957.84
guy I know guns of

10954.68 --> 10962.84
naon talk to him for

10957.84 --> 10962.84
ages this guy is not him

10974.72 --> 10978.0
that doesn't make any damn

10987.2 --> 10993.359
sense making up information how do you

10990.04 --> 10993.359
know that

11020.92 --> 11026.239
dude the [ __ ] are you just jumping in

11024.2 --> 11028.239000000001
there telling him he's

11026.239 --> 11030.08
lying what about I

11028.239 --> 11034.0
what is

11030.08 --> 11034.0
this lying about

11036.76 --> 11043.239
what just because he's finding another

11040.04 --> 11044.92
eological root for a word doesn't mean

11043.239 --> 11048.68
it's

11044.92 --> 11048.68
lying it's very

11056.72 --> 11060.679999999998
strange for

11116.52 --> 11119.640000000001
hello dupons

11126.92 --> 11132.68
and he proof he's lying well he's not

11129.279 --> 11135.84
sticking to the official typical

11132.68 --> 11139.359
explanations that when you Google

11135.84 --> 11141.72
atmology of certain words then they're

11139.359 --> 11145.479000000001
going to tell you a different story and

11141.72 --> 11149.199999999999
so level with me considers that to be a

11145.479 --> 11152.039999999999
lie if it doesn't compart with the the

11149.2 --> 11152.04
standard search

11153.04 --> 11161.84
results right just like if you Google

11158.2 --> 11163.479000000001
the coris effect then part of what

11161.84 --> 11168.56
you're going to find is going to tell

11163.479 --> 11173.08
you that it's actually about an actual

11168.56 --> 11173.08
deviation even though that's obviously

11176.319 --> 11184.239
incorrect right so I wouldn't like say

11180.399 --> 11186.64
like oh when I Googled it it gave me a

11184.239 --> 11189.039999999999
different search result as what the guy

11186.64 --> 11191.84
is saying about it right now so that

11189.04 --> 11191.84
means he's

11192.64 --> 11195.84
lying does

11197.84 --> 11204.64
it I mean have you actually taken his

11201.64 --> 11208.479
reasoning and then Prov it specifically

11204.64 --> 11212.0
to be incorrect not by presenting an

11208.479 --> 11214.76
accepted other interpretation but by

11212.0 --> 11219.08
proving what he said is

11214.76 --> 11223.319
wrong cuz to me what he said sounded all

11219.08 --> 11226.319
to be very doable it's very plausible to

11223.319 --> 11226.319
me

11239.8 --> 11245.479
it's up to him to prove it oh so it's

11242.0 --> 11246.8
just up to you to just accuse people of

11245.479 --> 11249.72
like being

11246.8 --> 11253.119999999999
liars and then they have to defend

11249.72 --> 11256.64
themselves against your accusation that

11253.12 --> 11260.640000000001
you can just dle out just like

11256.64 --> 11260.64
that really

11274.96 --> 11278.8
okay well we're but yeah fine you you

11276.76 --> 11283.880000000001
can do that I'm just trying to point out

11278.8 --> 11283.88
it seemed a little unreasonable to me

11342.88 --> 11349.319

11346.08 --> 11352.96
that you're already wrong as to who you

11349.319 --> 11356.239
think Robert Thorndike actually is you

11352.96 --> 11359.358999999999
think he's guns of naon no he's not

11356.239 --> 11359.359
obviously he isn't

11360.92 --> 11365.88
where the hell did

11362.479 --> 11365.88
you take

11383.8 --> 11393.239
this okay I did say Name by Hitler so

11387.12 --> 11393.239000000001
per was named Iran by Hitler or

11397.319 --> 11402.92
renamed I don't know exactly if that is

11400.8 --> 11406.239
technically

11402.92 --> 11409.359
correct I'm not sure I just know that

11406.239 --> 11413.439
Hitler was interested in Iran because of

11409.359 --> 11416.880000000001
the Aryan origins of it of some of those

11413.439 --> 11416.880000000001
people there

11424.439 --> 11430.439
do you dude what is your problem why are

11427.88 --> 11432.119999999999
you being so incredibly negative you're

11430.439 --> 11433.359
just coming in here and you're just

11432.12 --> 11436.359
accusing

11433.359 --> 11436.359
somebody

11445.56 --> 11451.76
why no you're not doing anything duper

11448.68 --> 11454.76
you're coming into my chat 3 hours after

11451.76 --> 11459.399
I started the show you're not doing

11454.76 --> 11459.399
anything except showing up late

11485.64 --> 11490.039999999999
it's me oh okay I thought it was

11487.68 --> 11493.439
somebody else

11490.04 --> 11496.04
what of course you are you what what

11493.439 --> 11496.04
does that even

11498.88 --> 11504.278999999999
mean posted counter evidence yeah well

11502.6 --> 11506.76
it's not much of

11504.279 --> 11509.640000000001
evidence I mean what counter evidence

11506.76 --> 11512.439
you just made another claim and that's

11509.64 --> 11516.278999999999
it just oh you named

11512.439 --> 11518.720000000001
another word root for the

11516.279 --> 11521.0
atmology that's it oh that's supposed to

11518.72 --> 11524.479
prove that he's a

11521.0 --> 11524.479
liar I don't get

11524.92 --> 11534.399
it you you do realize that atmology is

11530.0 --> 11538.8
actually Up For Debate

11534.399 --> 11540.56
right it's an attempt to to

11538.8 --> 11544.438999999998
reconstruct the

11540.56 --> 11547.439
origins it's not absolutely

11544.439 --> 11549.64
certain it's just an interpretation it's

11547.439 --> 11552.52
like okay we're going to assume that

11549.64 --> 11555.439
this is originating from this

11552.52 --> 11560.640000000001
language

11555.439 --> 11564.6
yeah there no definitive evidence things

11560.64 --> 11566.72
might po pop up to prove that hey wait

11564.6 --> 11569.68
it actually didn't happen like that

11566.72 --> 11572.96
there's another way that it formed

11569.68 --> 11577.08
through something that was before this

11572.96 --> 11580.479
time not readily available information

11577.08 --> 11584.72
about what was happening then yeah so

11580.479 --> 11584.72
atmology is kind of a flexible

11585.239 --> 11591.6
thing there's interpretations like

11588.92 --> 11595.76
there's even like disputed points within

11591.6 --> 11599.399000000001
atmology like yeah some think that this

11595.76 --> 11601.92
word comes from that

11599.399 --> 11604.0
language some other people think it

11601.92 --> 11606.359
comes from this language and some people

11604.0 --> 11608.68
think it comes from that language and

11606.359 --> 11611.319
none of them can literally be

11608.68 --> 11616.399
definitively proven to be

11611.319 --> 11616.399
correct that's just what it

11617.359 --> 11625.68
is would you ever use atmology to

11620.319 --> 11625.68
support your ideas yeah sure I would

11630.319 --> 11635.119999999999
but that doesn't mean that

11632.319 --> 11639.119999999999
it that there can be

11635.12 --> 11639.12
multiple interpretations

11663.239 --> 11667.359
oh level with me so you think that

11665.08 --> 11669.279
that's

11667.359 --> 11672.76
dull

11669.279 --> 11675.319000000001
but so that bores you yet you are

11672.76 --> 11677.960000000001
willing to accuse him of

11675.319 --> 11682.039999999999
lying sounds like you just have too much

11677.96 --> 11682.039999999999
time on your hands then

11708.6 --> 11713.0
anyway yeah I thought

11710.399 --> 11714.72
that whatever you think level with me

11713.0 --> 11717.52
and I don't have anything against you I

11714.72 --> 11720.599999999999
don't know why you're just like RAC

11717.52 --> 11723.76
here against this guy but my show has

11720.6 --> 11727.16
been very interesting having him

11723.76 --> 11727.16
on in the

11734.239 --> 11742.119999999999
chat D

11737.16 --> 11744.16
just I mean are you just like trying to

11742.12 --> 11747.68
ask the dumbest questions you could ever

11744.16 --> 11750.039999999999
think of duper

11747.68 --> 11752.439
is it just in your nature to do that

11750.04 --> 11752.439
sort of

11757.08 --> 11762.319
thing hey KP good to see you

11785.84 --> 11790.84
it's kind of strange to have one eye as

11788.239 --> 11795.68
a profile picture yeah and it's kind of

11790.84 --> 11799.319
strange to have 33 in your email address

11795.68 --> 11800.960000000001
too does that mean that I'm Illuminati

11799.319 --> 11804.8
do you even know what the [ __ ]

11800.96 --> 11804.8
Illuminati is

11831.56 --> 11835.88
New World

11833.279 --> 11838.84
Order okay well that's even more

11835.88 --> 11838.839999999998
nonsensical

11839.6 --> 11845.92
how does one eye picture relate to New

11843.16 --> 11845.92
World Order

11860.52 --> 11865.76
dupons one I H the dollar bill

11869.81 --> 11875.6

11872.76 --> 11879.0
duper are you part of the New World

11875.6 --> 11881.800000000001
Order cuz I'm pretty sure that you use

11879.0 --> 11887.479
dollars and dollars have a pyramid with

11881.8 --> 11890.64
an eye on it are you new world order

11890.64 --> 11895.519999999999
dollar

bills so by that logic you're new world

don't deny

11916.359 --> 11923.6
it my point is it's [ __ ] [ __ ]

duper why do you ask [ __ ] questions

11923.6 --> 11929.92

11933.279 --> 11939.6
the dumbest [ __ ] possible question

11936.76 --> 11942.399
you could ask cuz that's what you seem

11939.6 --> 11946.279
to do every goddamn time you show up

11942.399 --> 11948.278999999999
duper you think of the dumbest B [ __ ]

11946.279 --> 11951.279
possible question you could ask you've

11948.279 --> 11954.92
been doing this for a [ __ ] year now

11951.279 --> 11958.6
could you just ask a non totally

[ __ ] question what one [ __ ]

11958.6 --> 11964.84
time you keep doing this could you just

11962.12 --> 11970.880000000001
not be a complete [ __ ]

11964.84 --> 11970.880000000001
[ __ ] one [ __ ] time in your life

he'll be back

12041.399 --> 12048.64

like are you clinically [ __ ] it's a

12069.72 --> 12076.0
genuine question

12072.359 --> 12079.04
cuz every time you show you've never

12076.0 --> 12082.479
actually asked an intelligent question

12079.04 --> 12082.479000000001
one goddamn

12082.64 --> 12092.64
time why are your questions always

12088.76 --> 12092.64
[ __ ] it's [ __ ]

12104.52 --> 12109.76
tedious like it makes me

12107.319 --> 12112.319
get cranky every time you show up

12109.76 --> 12115.359
because every time you show up the only

12112.319 --> 12116.399
thing you ever do is ask really [ __ ]

12115.359 --> 12119.279
stupid

12116.399 --> 12122.08
questions could you just not ask

12119.279 --> 12126.640000000001
incredibly [ __ ] stupid questions just

12122.08 --> 12129.64
one damn time why are you always like

this

12132.399 --> 12137.88
stop I don't care if you're asking

12135.399 --> 12141.08
somebody else could you just not ask a

12137.88 --> 12144.759999999998
[ __ ] question one

12141.08 --> 12149.16
time can't you just think of like

12144.76 --> 12152.08
hey this is a really mundane dumbass

12149.16 --> 12156.0
question maybe I shouldn't ask the

12152.08 --> 12159.96
mundane dumbass question like proceed to

12156.0 --> 12163.279
think a little bit more

12159.96 --> 12166.23
meticulously towards a question that has

12163.279 --> 12169.29
a point

12166.23 --> 12169.289999999999
[Music]

12169.68 --> 12173.04
it's it's

12183.84 --> 12188.199
infuriating yeah level with me you don't

12186.0 --> 12190.92
know what the [ __ ] you're talking

12188.199 --> 12193.800000000001
about this guy's been hanging around for

12190.92 --> 12197.16
like over a year and it's every time the

12193.8 --> 12197.16
same [ __ ]

12200.92 --> 12209.439
like even a 12year old can't be that

12205.16 --> 12209.439
persistently pointless for that

12209.8 --> 12216.679999999998
long it makes me feel like he is

12212.96 --> 12216.679999999998
literally clinically

12219.0 --> 12226.199
[ __ ] and not just

12223.04 --> 12229.960000000001
seemingly and it's just I'm sick of it

12226.199 --> 12229.960000000001
dude just evolve

12248.239 --> 12252.319
already good teacher lets the students

12250.96 --> 12256.319

clinically

12267.16 --> 12273.72
[ __ ] yeah I'm not going to allow

12270.399 --> 12276.198999999999
students here if they always drag down

12273.72 --> 12278.599999999999
the level of whatever is going on just

12276.199 --> 12283.0
by speaking

12278.6 --> 12283.0
up I don't tolerate that

12283.239 --> 12288.039999999999
[ __ ] don't break the flow

12304.96 --> 12308.039999999999
you only know what's

12308.72 --> 12312.239
up it's just

12312.52 --> 12318.84
that ah I I don't want to even try I

12316.479 --> 12321.84
mean I shouldn't be need to explain any

12318.84 --> 12321.84
of this to any of

12326.0 --> 12332.16
you we're all meant to be asking

12328.96 --> 12335.919999999998
questions yeah except questions that are

12332.16 --> 12335.92
[ __ ] stupid

12364.479 --> 12371.438999999998
you try to ask more to the point yeah

12367.08 --> 12374.199
it's about damn time indeed you do that

12371.439 --> 12378.800000000001
then maybe I'll start stop yelling at

12374.199 --> 12378.800000000001

12479.04 --> 12485.439
the show I don't do anything special for

12481.52 --> 12485.439
any show ever

12486.52 --> 12492.359

12489.439 --> 12493.92
that's a night all show and it has

12492.359 --> 12495.880000000001
special guests yeah well that's not a

12493.92 --> 12496.8
flat Earth early birth show now is it

12495.88 --> 12499.679999999998
yeah

12496.8 --> 12502.278999999999
because there's not going to be a

12499.68 --> 12504.439
special episode of The Flat Earth early

12502.279 --> 12507.199
birth show that's going to be a night

12504.439 --> 12508.64
owl show Because the Night Owl show is

12507.199 --> 12512.479000000001
the night owl

12508.64 --> 12514.8
show yeah Flat Earth early birth show is

12512.479 --> 12516.76
the Flat Earth early birth show I never

12514.8 --> 12519.08
do anything special for the Flat Earth

12516.76 --> 12522.68
early birth show and never

12519.08 --> 12524.319
will now the nightl show is another show

12522.68 --> 12526.319
and whatever is going to happen with

12524.319 --> 12528.92
that is going to happen with that it's

12526.319 --> 12532.198999999999
not something that I always do on a

12528.92 --> 12535.68
daily basis so I might actually do

12532.199 --> 12535.68
something special for that

12538.12 --> 12544.0
sometimes and that's where you get a

12541.76 --> 12548.52
time out for the rest of the shows have

12544.0 --> 12548.52
happy because it's not funny

12572.8 --> 12577.319
true Master knows he always only a

12579.84 --> 12583.8
student that's interesting

12584.64 --> 12593.519999999999
yeah I'd say differently a true Master

12587.76 --> 12593.52
knows that they can only learn from a

12595.279 --> 12600.880000000001
student cuz no you're not only a student

12598.68 --> 12603.439
you're teaching it but you'll learn

12600.88 --> 12605.679999999998
something new from the students from

12603.439 --> 12609.68
their

12605.68 --> 12609.68
fresh perspective

12616.12 --> 12621.08
something terrible happened to me oh I'm

12625.04 --> 12631.439
sure

12627.84 --> 12631.439
what you got

12631.479 --> 12636.198999999999
scammed all righty then

12655.279 --> 12661.68
well I guess it was inevitable since you

12658.64 --> 12663.039999999999
seem to be incapable of not doing things

12661.68 --> 12668.08
that are

12663.04 --> 12668.080000000002
[ __ ] but uh yeah sorry to hear that

12674.92 --> 12678.88
duper for

12690.07 --> 12693.18
[Music]

12713.52 --> 12718.84
ignoran is not to be ah about that word

12716.72 --> 12721.438999999998
though Robert

12718.84 --> 12723.960000000001
Thorndike I have a lot of trouble with

12721.439 --> 12723.960000000001
the word

12727.6 --> 12734.12
ignorance cuz to me ignorance is like

12731.52 --> 12736.640000000001
almost per definition willing ignorance

12734.12 --> 12742.12
because it's like an action you

12736.64 --> 12742.119999999999
ignore ignorance is like to

12744.04 --> 12753.560000000001
ignore ignoring is something you do on

12748.199 --> 12757.0
purpose so to me it's like

12753.56 --> 12760.16
inclined or suggested that ignorance is

12757.0 --> 12762.92
automatically willing ignorance and that

12760.16 --> 12765.359
is stupidity if you ignore something

12762.92 --> 12766.8
consciously then that's stupid that's

12765.359 --> 12771.0
literally

12766.8 --> 12774.96
deciding to cut information out of your

12771.0 --> 12778.72
conscious now just being

12774.96 --> 12781.96
unformed which is the technical meaning

12778.72 --> 12783.84
of ignorance that's not stupidity if

12781.96 --> 12788.16
you're just not informed that's not

12783.84 --> 12788.16
stupid you're just not informed

12809.12 --> 12814.720000000001
what okay duper that's very

12815.88 --> 12821.198999999999
tragic why the [ __ ] would you do that

12828.84 --> 12832.479
that's just

12837.76 --> 12841.64
why but yeah it

12842.04 --> 12847.319000000001
sucks maybe next time not be so

12844.8 --> 12851.358999999999
unbelievably impulsive especially when

12847.319 --> 12851.359
it comes to money things

12878.239 --> 12887.119999999999
he claimed the banks are going oh my God

12883.12 --> 12887.12
stuper duper

12888.8 --> 12896.56
never ever listen to Fear

12893.96 --> 12899.239
never it's always

12896.56 --> 12902.519999999999
[ __ ] like that's like the number one

12899.239 --> 12906.359
go-to scam like oh somebody's making you

12902.52 --> 12912.359
afraid you have to do this or danger

12906.359 --> 12912.359
that like that must be a scam like per

12914.08 --> 12920.0
default the name of who gives a [ __ ]

12917.199 --> 12923.800000000001
about the name of the

12920.0 --> 12926.439
scammer like that name probably gets

12923.8 --> 12929.8
deleted and just change to something

12926.439 --> 12932.52
else scammers take on names whatever

12929.8 --> 12935.438999999998
they think will be trusted by the place

12932.52 --> 12935.439
where they're hanging

12936.199 --> 12942.0
around he was never scammed before I

12938.92 --> 12946.72
highly doubt that duper you probably

12942.0 --> 12946.72
forgot the previous times that happened

12961.84 --> 12966.239
that's right letter s

12979.64 --> 12984.198999999999
different who cares stuper you're not

12982.439 --> 12985.84
getting it back you shouldn't have done

12984.199 --> 12990.84
that it's

12985.84 --> 12990.84
stupid you're not getting it back

13011.76 --> 13017.16
had to learn from the hard way myself

13014.479 --> 13020.0
yeah well I've never been scammed like

13017.16 --> 13021.319
that almost I had my computer get hacked

13020.0 --> 13024.319
one

13021.319 --> 13025.64
time because of some guy that called me

13024.319 --> 13027.8
up and I

13025.64 --> 13031.239
panicked but

13027.8 --> 13034.479
I I figured it out halfway like this is

13031.239 --> 13037.198999999999
nonsense and then I just hung up and

13034.479 --> 13039.64
fixed my [ __ ]

13037.199 --> 13043.92
so yeah it's not like I'm completely

13039.64 --> 13046.319
impervious to it but like I'm not yeah

13043.92 --> 13047.399
play stupid games Win stupid prizes yeah

13046.319 --> 13049.72
yeah

13047.399 --> 13054.039999999999
yeah I mean it's never going to happen

13049.72 --> 13054.039999999999
to me ever against anything like

13054.72 --> 13059.72
that the [ __ ] out of here

13079.0 --> 13084.96
right but yeah man time has flown and

13081.96 --> 13084.96
I'm going to round out the

13088.399 --> 13093.358999999999
show H looks like I got five rogans up

13091.8 --> 13098.358999999999
by

13093.359 --> 13101.640000000001
now how to get rid of the Flies you did

13098.359 --> 13101.640000000001
I did not see

13104.0 --> 13109.399
that but uh yeah the flies have mostly

13106.92 --> 13112.0
been away I don't know where the hell

13109.399 --> 13116.319
these flies are coming

13112.0 --> 13116.319
from they could be coming from

13120.399 --> 13126.119999999999
outside there should be wor yeah I don't

13123.359 --> 13129.239
think people are going to buy into that

13126.12 --> 13132.6
[ __ ] most people will figure out very

13129.239 --> 13132.6
quickly when that's a scam

13146.92 --> 13153.319
duper right anyhow thanks everyone for

13149.96 --> 13157.16
coming I hope you like this show water

13153.319 --> 13157.16
reflect from there

13160.279 --> 13167.279
huh that's

13163.16 --> 13167.279
interesting so surface of

13167.92 --> 13174.239
water okay okay that that's interesting

13171.439 --> 13177.479000000001
I've never heard of that one before I'll

13174.239 --> 13177.479
definitely take that into

13178.8 --> 13183.358999999999
consideration right and yes Robert

13181.04 --> 13187.720000000001
Thorndike it has been nice meeting you

13183.359 --> 13187.720000000001
hope to see you come by more

13199.36 --> 13210.02
[Music]

13210.12 --> 13215.319000000001
often subscribed yeah I noticed I saw

13212.64 --> 13217.519999999999
your subscription thanks and uh yeah

13215.319 --> 13220.359
hope to see around more often and

13217.52 --> 13222.6
there's uh I bet there's a lot of things

13220.359 --> 13225.84
that we could

13222.6 --> 13228.279
discuss right but yeah today's show has

13225.84 --> 13231.64
been interesting subjectwise I mean the

13228.279 --> 13235.12
whole Bones from the

13231.64 --> 13238.08
catacombs whose were they how did that

13235.12 --> 13240.160000000002
happen is that a secret construction or

13238.08 --> 13242.72
was it an ancient tradition that they

13240.16 --> 13245.8
all people back then know like yeah we

13242.72 --> 13248.319
get buried and then our bones are put

13245.8 --> 13251.56
beneath the the Holy Temple so that we

13248.319 --> 13254.399
could like in our spirit Beyond Death

13251.56 --> 13256.72
radiate forth and comfort our Offspring

13254.399 --> 13260.16
right I mean I can definitely imagine

13256.72 --> 13262.358999999999
that there was just an an open tradition

13260.16 --> 13264.199
like that I can't imagine that it

13262.359 --> 13265.439
doesn't like every time there's some

13264.199 --> 13266.960000000001
dead somewhere and there's no

13265.439 --> 13270.359
explanation it doesn't have to be like

13266.96 --> 13273.438999999998
it's a bunch of Satanist sacrificed

13270.359 --> 13277.0
everybody like that stupid fear porn

13273.439 --> 13280.960000000001
always it gets kind of tedious yeah

13277.0 --> 13285.439
so I think it could be a benevolent

13280.96 --> 13287.56
tradition from the tartarians

13285.439 --> 13289.960000000001
potentially I mean if it was a

13287.56 --> 13293.8
benevolent tradition from the Taria that

13289.96 --> 13293.8
would certainly explain

13293.92 --> 13300.479
why that information as to like how all

13297.479 --> 13306.08
that happened is completely

13300.479 --> 13306.08
gone why that's not publicly shared

13309.319 --> 13311.68
right

13316.56 --> 13324.198999999999
anyhow Discord yeah okay duper

13321.479 --> 13326.159
just I don't know try not to be so

13324.199 --> 13328.359
unbelievably

13326.159 --> 13330.119999999999
gullible now you lost a couple of

13328.359 --> 13332.6
hundred

13330.12 --> 13334.84
bucks yeah it could get worse could get

13332.6 --> 13336.56
a lot worse you could like do the same

13334.84 --> 13339.6
dumb [ __ ] with

13336.56 --> 13341.359
like your mortgage or whatever or your

13339.6 --> 13344.439
house in the future and then you lose

13341.359 --> 13348.239
hundreds of thousands so just don't

13344.439 --> 13350.960000000001
don't be so damn gullible

13348.239 --> 13353.64
online and you might actually build a

13350.96 --> 13353.64
life that

13353.68 --> 13358.6
way
