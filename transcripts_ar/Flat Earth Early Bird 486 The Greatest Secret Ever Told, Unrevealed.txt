67.3 --> 72.42999999999999
patron my GoFundMe and the super chat

69.19 --> 93.67
that will be much appreciated so today

72.43 --> 96.43
again it's perfect blue skies but at the

93.67 --> 98.619
same time also there's this cold steady

96.43 --> 101.77000000000001
wind you don't really see it that much

98.619 --> 104.259
because it's so steady but I went for

101.77 --> 107.289
groceries through that and it was

104.259 --> 109.93
actually kind of annoying you know when

107.289 --> 112.479
you when you're going against the wind

109.93 --> 114.76
like that you know it feels very much

112.479 --> 118.06
like winter because that that wind is

114.76 --> 120.79
just very cold but hey if you're out of

118.06 --> 124.21000000000001
the wind in the Sun it's actually quite

120.79 --> 126.67
quite nice and warm so yeah interesting

124.21 --> 133.12
start of the spring here over over here

126.67 --> 137.94
in the Netherlands so far so let's see

133.12 --> 137.94
using jet I got tea with me

144.17 --> 157.73
so a GM was first mark colored the West

151.709 --> 164.0
Watson over muku good servant Tom Parker

157.73 --> 168.07999999999998
Patricia Dockery bred em mind-warped

164.0 --> 176.61
bandsaw bandit silver umbrella Walter

168.08 --> 182.31
hmm yeah good to see you all so oh I had

176.61 --> 184.83
a weird day today it's like I don't know

182.31 --> 186.93
it I got I got an interesting experience

184.83 --> 188.97
pretty much before the show started I

186.93 --> 192.51000000000002
had a call with my healer who kind of

188.97 --> 195.87
dropped something on me that just made

192.51 --> 201.84
such an impact it's just like what no

195.87 --> 204.269
way no way it's connected so much

201.84 --> 206.97
throughout my experience like very young

204.269 --> 209.76
experiences dark world experience things

206.97 --> 211.68
I even told my healer that kind of

209.76 --> 222.03
slipped by and now he told me this and

211.68 --> 227.31
was like no no no no it can't be exactly

222.03 --> 230.64
that that's just that's just too much

227.31 --> 233.609
Matt this is so yeah it kind of

230.64 --> 237.86999999999998
instructed me not to be too upfront

233.609 --> 240.09
about that just yet so I want because I

237.87 --> 244.799
actually follow the advice of my either

240.09 --> 249.12
who I trust I trust his intuition about

244.799 --> 251.19
it but it's kind of funny how he threw

249.12 --> 253.20000000000002
his channel through his sources which

251.19 --> 256.049
are very different from what we're doing

253.2 --> 258.69
over here but still very much aimed at

256.049 --> 263.789
the truth although they seek it in on

258.69 --> 264.27
much more spiritual it's it's just

263.789 --> 267.57
different

264.27 --> 272.039
anyway of Steinar legacy you know and

267.57 --> 274.19
all that the ethereal a lot but it's

272.039 --> 277.2
funny how they kind of

274.19 --> 280.44
came to the same conclusions about the

277.2 --> 282.96
situation as it's transpiring with the

280.44 --> 284.79
corona that's not what it is that's the

282.96 --> 289.44
obvious you don't figured I went out

284.79 --> 293.94
you're really a drone but just he

289.44 --> 298.08
connected some things and it's like he

293.94 --> 303.77
revealed certain information to me that

298.08 --> 308.52
is kind of public yet it's so freaky

303.77 --> 314.84999999999997
that it's just nobody deals with it

308.52 --> 318.0
I can't it's still freaky anyway whoo

314.85 --> 321.99
exciting reveal maybe at the end of the

318.0 --> 324.3
show maybe probably not though I have to

321.99 --> 326.22
think about this one but anyway the

324.3 --> 329.43
weird let's just start out with the

326.22 --> 331.74
start of today like I got up I actually

329.43 --> 336.96
went to bed pretty early a little bit

331.74 --> 339.6
more early than last time was it two

336.96 --> 341.58
o'clock so I'm really trying to since

339.6 --> 344.1
Spring has now started the winter is

341.58 --> 347.82
finally over as it were lately

344.1 --> 351.33000000000004
I'm letting myself like okay I have to

347.82 --> 355.40999999999997
get as much of this Sun as I possibly

351.33 --> 359.37
can so I've got to migrate my my day and

355.41 --> 362.85
nighttime rhythm back to early because I

359.37 --> 365.22
need that Sun I needed a lot and that

362.85 --> 370.05
means that I might not be life watching

365.22 --> 371.88000000000005
as much and being in chat yeah I'm the

370.05 --> 375.06
American side when they typically go

371.88 --> 378.27
live unfortunately but yeah I have to do

375.06 --> 380.67
this because it's just healthier for me

378.27 --> 382.79999999999995
but one of the weird effects today was

380.67 --> 385.98
that yeah

382.8 --> 387.27000000000004
I was just like yeah wow it's spring

385.98 --> 389.46000000000004
it's good I'm going in the right

387.27 --> 395.31
direction I'm actually doing really good

389.46 --> 399.71999999999997
and suddenly it just like sneaked up on

395.31 --> 401.85
me from the background it was well it

399.72 --> 403.95000000000005
kind of describes the process that I've

401.85 --> 406.98
been trying to explain in my

403.95 --> 408.93
staring into the darkness is like when

406.98 --> 411.09000000000003
everything is solved or seems to be

408.93 --> 414.27
solved then new problems arrive well

411.09 --> 416.94
something arrived all right like inside

414.27 --> 420.04999999999995
of me didn't get full control but I just

416.94 --> 424.05
certainly got really pissed off

420.05 --> 428.73
realizing just the so many weaknesses

424.05 --> 430.86
and like how easy it's at least seems

428.73 --> 433.41
for some people to go along together and

430.86 --> 438.65000000000003
god yeah I suddenly started to get all

433.41 --> 442.74
like that and like ah it aggravated and

438.65 --> 446.25
yeah I recognize this designs and it's

442.74 --> 449.94
like oh [ __ ] this is Ahriman suddenly

446.25 --> 455.19
Ireland came over came me and of course

449.94 --> 456.69
I very cognitive stable mentally so even

455.19 --> 461.0
though my feelings were getting weird I

456.69 --> 465.15
was like [ __ ] that I yeah it's like I

461.0 --> 466.86
don't know sudden temper tantrum out of

465.15 --> 468.59999999999997
nothing you could compare it to that and

466.86 --> 471.69
that's kind of then how I start to

468.6 --> 473.91
express it and yeah just look around

471.69 --> 476.43
make sure that not too many people

473.91 --> 479.67
around then I start cursing like damn

476.43 --> 481.92
you would die I don't don't curse at god

479.67 --> 484.71000000000004
but i'm just like getting really pissed

481.92 --> 486.36
off at the world all of a sudden but

484.71 --> 489.59999999999997
yeah that kind of unnerved me

486.36 --> 492.24
now this sort of happens more often but

489.6 --> 496.20000000000005
this just came out of nothing with such

492.24 --> 498.3
good weather just like why why would I

496.2 --> 502.56
feel like that and yeah then I called my

498.3 --> 505.26
healer because he's very good at like

502.56 --> 507.63
explaining and restoring some of that

505.26 --> 511.95
situation because when that happens to

507.63 --> 515.76
me I kind of lose my earth thing lose my

511.95 --> 518.43
connection with the earth and yes it's

515.76 --> 521.669
the aerial stuff and he fixed it and it

518.43 --> 523.14
really helped a lot so much and then he

521.669 --> 528.93
proceeded to explain like what's

523.14 --> 530.6999999999999
probably going on and just yeah let's

528.93 --> 531.51
just say there's two words that are

530.7 --> 534.62
involved

531.51 --> 534.62
wait no three

535.74 --> 542.02
this is all I'm gonna give for now but

538.21 --> 544.87
the funny thing is these are three words

542.02 --> 547.03
that are very very familiar to everyone

544.87 --> 554.52
here everyone I'm absolutely certain

547.03 --> 558.76
those three words are Corona g5 5g

554.52 --> 563.3199999999999
vaccines but it's probably not what

558.76 --> 570.9399999999999
you're gonna think it's because this is

563.32 --> 573.6700000000001
something that is yeah it's been around

570.94 --> 576.1300000000001
for 50 years and that's as far as I'm

573.67 --> 578.79
gonna go with this mystery which is what

576.13 --> 580.96
its gonna be for now until somebody else

578.79 --> 582.5799999999999
that may have stumbled upon this may

580.96 --> 585.46
actually realize what I'm talking about

582.58 --> 588.37
and then just throw it at me like is

585.46 --> 594.0
this it our wait is that it and then I

588.37 --> 596.68
might say we'll see how long it takes

594.0 --> 608.92
because this one's gonna need some time

596.68 --> 611.3199999999999
for me all right and I also want

608.92 --> 613.5699999999999
everyone to realize that when I say 5g

611.32 --> 617.8000000000001
in this case it's not specifically the

613.57 --> 621.34
mobile of 5g installations now 5g is

617.8 --> 627.4
kind of general to that frequency and

621.34 --> 631.39
that includes Wi-Fi mobile Wi-Fi router

627.4 --> 635.98
Wi-Fi and even Bluetooth and that kind

631.39 --> 638.62
of thing that is basically when yeah 5g

635.98 --> 641.32
of course that is now very actual

638.62 --> 642.34
because of the 5g installation upgrade

641.32 --> 645.73
supposedly if the phone companies

642.34 --> 648.22
everywhere what they want to do with all

645.73 --> 651.04
the controversy and the the data that's

648.22 --> 654.8100000000001
actually not good at all and people

651.04 --> 659.26
don't really like it the idea of it but

654.81 --> 662.56
yeah it kind of already was there that

659.26 --> 667.0
the effective technology yeah through

662.56 --> 669.4
Wi-Fi and routers that

667.0 --> 672.04
yeah it comes down to the same type of

669.4 --> 674.38
thing the same type of influence yeah so

672.04 --> 679.15
it therefore it has been there for a

674.38 --> 681.22
while and I'm gonna let this all sink in

679.15 --> 684.39
very very carefully and then when it's

681.22 --> 688.09
finally sunk in I'm gonna look at it

684.39 --> 690.73
from the new perspective and then I'm

688.09 --> 693.88
gonna draw the correlations and if I get

690.73 --> 697.24
this right if I get it as right as I

693.88 --> 700.36
suspect it's gonna blow so many minds

697.24 --> 706.57
it's just insane and I'm not just

700.36 --> 710.5600000000001
talking about flat earthers man Wow

706.57 --> 713.9200000000001
but yeah everything we've learned so far

710.56 --> 717.6999999999999
pretty much stands that's the funny

713.92 --> 720.52
thing this is not like oh I found the

717.7 --> 723.49
secret King formula oh this is exactly

720.52 --> 728.74
how you should have thought it was now

723.49 --> 735.91
this is way beyond what we're fooling

728.74 --> 738.339
around with here frequency control are

735.91 --> 741.1
we linked with oxygen levels and

738.339 --> 744.94
compromised immune systems right well

741.1 --> 747.76
those are those fall under the data that

744.94 --> 749.44
comes out of like technology influence

747.76 --> 751.9
on the general Constitution been

749.44 --> 757.1800000000001
summoned yes and that is very relevant

751.9 --> 758.38
data it does not however have to do with

757.18 --> 765.52
what I'm talking about

758.38 --> 768.13
which is just yeah yeah but yeah it's a

765.52 --> 769.87
good one they're still with everything

768.13 --> 775.5
we've been talking about so far is

769.87 --> 779.14
already very relevant right no vaccines

775.5 --> 781.0
vaccines are not a solution to pretty

779.14 --> 783.63
much anything and we've learned so much

781.0 --> 791.11
darkness about the vaccine industry that

783.63 --> 793.36
yeah eugenics Angles dumbing down yeah

791.11 --> 795.19
causing people to be sick to stay in the

793.36 --> 796.499
system make money of that kind of thing

795.19 --> 799.889
we already kind of have

796.499 --> 802.769
that to go on it's kind of it's it

799.889 --> 805.0790000000001
should be enough for any normal person

802.769 --> 808.559
when they take it look at that

805.079 --> 812.699
preponderance of data it's like yeah no

808.559 --> 815.309
no let's not do that right so that's

812.699 --> 820.199
that's already great that we got that

815.309 --> 823.199
right now 5g yeah it's pretty much

820.199 --> 825.269
already there but the negative

823.199 --> 828.2589999999999
influences have already been detected

825.269 --> 831.929
the direct measurable influences the

828.259 --> 834.3290000000001
yeah it's just not healthy it excites

831.929 --> 836.519
the cells is like a micro it's like a

834.329 --> 838.649
small lycra wave and especially if you

836.519 --> 840.599
hold your a heavy phone right next to

838.649 --> 844.439
your ear and talk for four hours it's

840.599 --> 845.909
actually really dangerous if you keep

844.439 --> 851.789
doing that and it's just gonna go

845.909 --> 853.259
completely bad extreme inflammations and

851.789 --> 858.559
all that it's terrible what can happen

853.259 --> 862.429
eventually so yeah try to avoid that

858.559 --> 866.819
that's another good one all right and

862.429 --> 870.269
then there is the corona and we also got

866.819 --> 877.799
that one right yeah my healer confirmed

870.269 --> 881.4590000000001
all of this and then so the corona is

877.799 --> 887.429
indeed he said it it's less than lethal

881.459 --> 893.789
it is a a weird mutant creation flu that

887.429 --> 895.9789999999999
is less than lethal but it has and I'm

893.789 --> 898.3489999999999
not just talking about psychological

895.979 --> 900.119
because that the of psychological

898.349 --> 902.729
operation is kind of up front it's

900.119 --> 907.409
blatant is this is like a try out face

902.729 --> 909.119
for every country to show their state

907.409 --> 912.319
craft in this type of a marriage it's

909.119 --> 914.429
almost like a role-playing test for

912.319 --> 916.7389999999999
governments in a way that's what it is

914.429 --> 919.939
media wise that is that part that's just

916.739 --> 925.72
a part of it okay right

919.939 --> 928.49
but yeah anyway it's

925.72 --> 929.2090000000001
I'm gonna I'm really gonna leave it I

928.49 --> 932.9590000000001
would yeah

929.209 --> 935.179
I know I hyped this up but I yeah I

932.959 --> 937.4899999999999
couldn't really not say anything there

935.179 --> 940.699
is something out there and it's I will

937.49 --> 944.72
eventually reveal it or maybe other

940.699 --> 950.139
people will before I do but yeah my ela

944.72 --> 955.5500000000001
told me like this is yeah this just

950.139 --> 958.009
because the weird thing is it's it's

955.55 --> 963.429
already been revealed but when it was

958.009 --> 967.369
revealed it people just all shut off

963.429 --> 971.379
walked away forgot about it it's that

967.369 --> 973.389
crazy because it just sounds too crazy

971.379 --> 976.749
all of it

973.389 --> 976.749
still creepy

983.78 --> 989.24
but yeah we'll get there because the

987.11 --> 993.65
awakening is happening and we're getting

989.24 --> 997.79
there where we're getting to the level

993.65 --> 1003.9
when we're ready to finally figure out

997.79 --> 1009.0
how crazy things really are but not yet

1003.9 --> 1011.77
almost there almost there

1009.0 --> 1013.98
you know what maybe I'll reveal it in a

1011.77 --> 1013.98
week

1023.99 --> 1028.39
maybe not I don't know

1035.81 --> 1040.1
tell us you write in the user manual not

1038.329 --> 1041.8999999999999
to touch your phone well it does tell

1040.1 --> 1045.079
you to keep at least what is it 10

1041.9 --> 1055.1000000000001
centimetres distance at all time right

1045.079 --> 1056.78
when it's active yeah you can look guys

1055.1 --> 1059.36
I already revealed to you that

1056.78 --> 1061.6399999999999
everything all the information all the

1059.36 --> 1066.83
data and the conclusions that we have

1061.64 --> 1070.3100000000002
already are good it's good enough it's

1066.83 --> 1072.1699999999998
good enough to go by you got it sorry

1070.31 --> 1074.45
but you gotta trust me on this I told

1072.17 --> 1076.8500000000001
you remember about when you get full

1074.45 --> 1084.73
oversight you gotta be able to handle

1076.85 --> 1095.75
this well trust me this is this is just

1084.73 --> 1097.64
no not yet not yet we're not ready but

1095.75 --> 1099.65
don't worry we're already on the right

1097.64 --> 1102.41
track we already got all the the

1099.65 --> 1110.93
building blocks we got and right so it's

1102.41 --> 1111.3500000000001
good well silver umbrella why is it a

1110.93 --> 1114.74
secret

1111.35 --> 1116.84
well because of the implications and the

1114.74 --> 1119.36
extremity of it and it will have two

1116.84 --> 1119.9299999999998
effects guaranteed if I just dropped it

1119.36 --> 1123.59
like that

1119.93 --> 1127.13
that is one people will freak out and

1123.59 --> 1130.73
literally think I've gone crazy too

1127.13 --> 1138.14
they will just spiral out of control

1130.73 --> 1140.39
with fear I did first time so bad that I

1138.14 --> 1142.3100000000002
forgot about it and still have paranoid

1140.39 --> 1145.16
echoes it's been part of the thing that

1142.31 --> 1149.21
have haunted me that I can't remember

1145.16 --> 1151.7
like four or five years with the because

1149.21 --> 1157.54
all this [ __ ] has all been told to my

1151.7 --> 1162.41
face very long ago on purpose with great

1157.54 --> 1165.26
with yea with great disdain specifically

1162.41 --> 1168.5600000000002
to try and break my mind because they

1165.26 --> 1169.24
knew I could not take it and they wanted

1168.56 --> 1172.7
to do that

1169.24 --> 1175.85
and they freak me out with something

1172.7 --> 1178.19
that was so insane but the most freaky

1175.85 --> 1192.1699999999998
part about it is that it was true and

1178.19 --> 1194.65
that is just the that so yeah yeah I

1192.17 --> 1199.75
know this is very very high P I know I

1194.65 --> 1202.42
don't do this often but yeah we can go

1199.75 --> 1212.93
with what we got and it's good enough

1202.42 --> 1216.25
just trust me on this for now right so

1212.93 --> 1219.6200000000001
this very mysterious episode so far

1216.25 --> 1222.71
don't count on me kind of making this

1219.62 --> 1225.6799999999998
into a thing I know people love this

1222.71 --> 1227.93
kind of [ __ ] but I don't do that on

1225.68 --> 1230.48
purpose it's not like oh wow I got

1227.93 --> 1233.42
something special I got something

1230.48 --> 1235.25
special that means that I got something

1233.42 --> 1238.52
to hype about for a week and get

1235.25 --> 1240.47
everybody all excited and no that's not

1238.52 --> 1244.06
what I'm doing here this is very very

1240.47 --> 1244.06
serious very serious

1257.83 --> 1264.87
well bait 60 RMC I wouldn't say that but

1261.34 --> 1264.87
yes it is

1266.309 --> 1277.57
you know what Oh God

1274.89 --> 1280.0590000000002
the only way I can really describe it

1277.57 --> 1282.37
although it's very easy to take it out

1280.059 --> 1285.07
of context in a lot of ways is that it's

1282.37 --> 1288.4899999999998
like a controlled contract with the

1285.07 --> 1292.32
devil for society it's like it an

1288.49 --> 1298.44
attempt to control the darkness and

1292.32 --> 1300.7
thereby being able to plan out better

1298.44 --> 1303.46
because that gives a lot of financial

1300.7 --> 1307.299
stability security and all that yeah

1303.46 --> 1311.5900000000001
it's really that basic to control the

1307.299 --> 1316.69
evil so you can better predict financial

1311.59 --> 1320.529
situations it's it sounds pretty

1316.69 --> 1321.76
insanely disgusting even when you put it

1320.529 --> 1325.21
like that but that's kind of what it is

1321.76 --> 1328.12
and is what it has been since it started

1325.21 --> 1332.159
just a long time ago it has taken many

1328.12 --> 1332.1589999999999
different shapes but that is the system

1343.6 --> 1357.1399999999999
right but yeah guess what the devil does

1349.07 --> 1359.96
not like to be hardest he likes to play

1357.14 --> 1361.7900000000002
around you know you put on that harness

1359.96 --> 1364.1000000000001
for you and just give you the the

1361.79 --> 1367.55
confidence like oh yeah we got diva on

1364.1 --> 1369.02
the control now you know we got this got

1367.55 --> 1370.9099999999999
everything playing at all look at all

1369.02 --> 1373.07
the money roll oh so good

1370.91 --> 1375.95
we got this well guess what that freakin

1373.07 --> 1377.8999999999999
devil can just shape change in this I'm

1375.95 --> 1381.5
talking metaphorically this is pure

1377.9 --> 1384.6200000000001
symbol pure symbol pure archetype symbol

1381.5 --> 1386.72
situation sketch symbolically okay don't

1384.62 --> 1389.12
make any mistake about that

1386.72 --> 1391.3700000000001
so yeah the devil can have on any

1389.12 --> 1393.5
harness and just like play along and

1391.37 --> 1396.59
then it'll just throw it off just like

1393.5 --> 1397.16
that when it's the most inconvenient and

1396.59 --> 1398.4199999999998
then guess what

1397.16 --> 1402.1100000000001
oh you don't have it under control

1398.42 --> 1405.6200000000001
that's that's kind of the the tricky

1402.11 --> 1408.02
problem it is for the mega bankers for

1405.62 --> 1412.9899999999998
the ones that are really driving this it

1408.02 --> 1412.99
is juggling with balls on fire

1414.04 --> 1423.05
cuz the devil does not like to be

1417.26 --> 1426.08
controlled you see what I mean but it's

1423.05 --> 1431.8999999999999
still sort of working then again not

1426.08 --> 1435.9499999999998
really there's just so many cascading

1431.9 --> 1439.5800000000002
bad side effects that have just been

1435.95 --> 1443.15
taking route even in the human general

1439.58 --> 1445.58
psyche in the last 200 years it's insane

1443.15 --> 1447.71
because we're nothing you human beings

1445.58 --> 1451.76
and what we are there like now is

1447.71 --> 1454.1000000000001
absolutely not even close to the state

1451.76 --> 1458.44
of general human consciousness that was

1454.1 --> 1463.3999999999999
around 300 years ago it's kind of funny

1458.44 --> 1464.96
because for example people well yeah a

1463.4 --> 1467.0900000000001
lot of people talked about

1464.96 --> 1470.509
I think Alex Jones talked about this

1467.09 --> 1472.34
like even years ago it's like yeah look

1470.509 --> 1476.779
at those photographs of those people

1472.34 --> 1478.7289999999998
from way way back and yeah it was like

1476.779 --> 1481.159
yeah they were not rich but look at the

1478.729 --> 1482.8400000000001
fire in their eyes and they just know

1481.159 --> 1485.6490000000001
they know

1482.84 --> 1490.009
doesn't matter what did they know and

1485.649 --> 1493.9699999999998
yeah that's really true and it is all

1490.009 --> 1495.769
because of the long-term contract with

1493.97 --> 1498.83
the devil of society and everybody that

1495.769 --> 1504.169
takes part in that that that goes along

1498.83 --> 1506.72
with it partially or fully and that that

1504.169 --> 1512.029
echoes on over the generations and they

1506.72 --> 1514.849
all become like scramble in their logo

1512.029 --> 1518.539
so they become more easily deprogrammed

1514.849 --> 1522.619
away from that and all that it is yeah

1518.539 --> 1525.08
it's taking its long-term toll in a

1522.619 --> 1530.32
sense you could say very of generalized

1525.08 --> 1533.6589999999999
like society is slowly being gratified a

1530.32 --> 1536.84
very long term process but we are kind

1533.659 --> 1539.239
of already in a pretty bad stage where

1536.84 --> 1544.849
just some people are of now openly

1539.239 --> 1547.07
insane in a bad like in a sick way in a

1544.849 --> 1550.269
sick way and people just let it happen

1547.07 --> 1556.119
it's like yeah that's normal now right

1550.269 --> 1559.159
what can you imagine something like that

1556.119 --> 1561.019
50 years ago hmm

1559.159 --> 1563.2990000000002
wait fifty years ago that's kind of the

1561.019 --> 1569.769
hippies and all right okay so that did

1563.299 --> 1569.769
kind of happen 50 years ago hmm

1572.52 --> 1578.41
okay yeah I completely broke my point

1575.29 --> 1581.8899999999999
now it's just it just seems like it's

1578.41 --> 1583.72
getting kind of bad but why is it

1581.89 --> 1588.49
getting better it's getting bad because

1583.72 --> 1590.8
there's no no pushback no well there is

1588.49 --> 1596.34
pushback but how much of a pushback is

1590.8 --> 1596.34
it really how pure is the pushback on

1597.18 --> 1603.7
top that is you know and yeah if it's

1601.48 --> 1606.31
not really being pushed back then

1603.7 --> 1609.55
corruption through the spirit through

1606.31 --> 1614.04
the people just aggravates people become

1609.55 --> 1614.04
more vile or insane more dwelling and

1614.19 --> 1621.6100000000001
yeah what what good is all this what

1617.44 --> 1624.6100000000001
good can a smooth technological

1621.61 --> 1630.4299999999998
functioning society be when nobody has

1624.61 --> 1633.4599999999998
the will to do anything good what good

1630.43 --> 1636.13
is all that that efficiency that

1633.46 --> 1637.72
smoothness the ease when everybody is

1636.13 --> 1641.7700000000002
just sick of everything and everybody

1637.72 --> 1647.82
else and just like I hate you in Haiti

1641.77 --> 1647.82
you know

1650.45 --> 1663.77
just I don't know okay it just feels

1661.58 --> 1667.36
like there's things we need to build

1663.77 --> 1670.1
down the it's like I've been very

1667.36 --> 1672.3799999999999
retracted technology-wise like I'm not

1670.1 --> 1674.09
on a mobile phone at all I still have a

1672.38 --> 1676.43
desktop computer seems kind of

1674.09 --> 1679.01
old-fashioned you know in a few years

1676.43 --> 1682.4
I'll be called a boomer for it probably

1679.01 --> 1686.99
or a little cat a comeback but I've

1682.4 --> 1691.01
always been very careful at taking in

1686.99 --> 1693.71
new technology in what I do very very

1691.01 --> 1695.98
careful like technophobic you can call

1693.71 --> 1700.73
me although I'm not a hundred percent

1695.98 --> 1704.42
what is it text techno exclusionist the

1700.73 --> 1706.64
not that I do use technology but it's

1704.42 --> 1709.46
just very very careful and engaging I

1706.64 --> 1712.0700000000002
always have been you know it took me

1709.46 --> 1714.89
years to even get myself to go over to

1712.07 --> 1716.6899999999998
discard because I just didn't trust it

1714.89 --> 1718.22
and that bad experience and once I have

1716.69 --> 1720.56
a bad experience trying out something

1718.22 --> 1724.21
new it could take years before I try

1720.56 --> 1729.86
again it's just that's how I work I

1724.21 --> 1733.4
guess it's not super efficient but being

1729.86 --> 1737.78
so slow with this has also saved me a

1733.4 --> 1742.8100000000002
lot of disappointment and hurt and waste

1737.78 --> 1742.81
of energy because you can see that now

1742.87 --> 1749.4799999999998
yeah the internet and technology and

1746.99 --> 1751.01
people building things you know that it

1749.48 --> 1753.08
is all getting more and more grabble

1751.01 --> 1756.26
people are like there's competition and

1753.08 --> 1758.48
people are getting pushed to go over

1756.26 --> 1761.18
borders or to oversimplify to

1758.48 --> 1763.85
commercialize like it's so seductive for

1761.18 --> 1765.92
people now because of the competition so

1763.85 --> 1768.83
it's getting slowly gratified and I'm in

1765.92 --> 1772.64
a way almost glad that I'm not a good

1768.83 --> 1775.6999999999998
photographer because then I might get

1772.64 --> 1778.13
caught up in that too and lose the

1775.7 --> 1780.74
purity slightly you know I'm a

1778.13 --> 1783.2900000000002
perfectionist like even a slight just

1780.74 --> 1785.57
one little step

1783.29 --> 1789.8799999999999
to me is one little step too much I'm

1785.57 --> 1793.06
that much of a I don't know

1789.88 --> 1796.66
fundamentalist conservative concerning

1793.06 --> 1796.6599999999999
how I do things

1800.53 --> 1805.36
you know unless I just get the clear

1803.23 --> 1807.67
sign from above like yeah this is what

1805.36 --> 1810.55
you're supposed to do now it's time with

1807.67 --> 1813.28
the four realization of the change that

1810.55 --> 1816.82
all has to be there or I'm just like no

1813.28 --> 1820.86
I'm not going to be seduced and just get

1816.82 --> 1823.09
taking in these things just for the

1820.86 --> 1826.2099999999998
imagination that I might have some kind

1823.09 --> 1829.1999999999998
of edge in a in a market or more money

1826.21 --> 1836.08
you know that's it

1829.2 --> 1839.14
so no I'll do exactly what I'm supposed

1836.08 --> 1844.06
to do at the speed that I'm supposed to

1839.14 --> 1848.17
do it and yeah I find it pretty damn

1844.06 --> 1852.45
tiresome and slow sometimes but it does

1848.17 --> 1855.0700000000002
also provide more condensed fruits and

1852.45 --> 1860.02
those are exactly the type of fruits

1855.07 --> 1863.02
that I need in order to grow so I'm just

1860.02 --> 1867.34
that type of tree and I just need that

1863.02 --> 1869.26
and then it works it's almost like knit

1867.34 --> 1872.29
I don't want to be like that yeah but I

1869.26 --> 1874.75
am like that and all Ricci now I was

1872.29 --> 1875.3799999999999
like no I want to be just like everybody

1874.75 --> 1878.86
else

1875.38 --> 1882.6000000000001
oh I'm gonna ignore I hate myself I hate

1878.86 --> 1887.02
that I'm so different and now it's like

1882.6 --> 1889.4499999999998
yeah sucks in a way makes me kind of

1887.02 --> 1891.1299999999999
feel isolated makes me very feel very

1889.45 --> 1893.8600000000001
different than everybody else but at the

1891.13 --> 1896.44
same time wow look at I learned to

1893.86 --> 1898.8899999999999
appreciate more what I have the

1896.44 --> 1904.54
qualities that I do have you know and

1898.89 --> 1906.8500000000001
how they are they kind of stand out

1904.54 --> 1908.83
compared to the general public if you

1906.85 --> 1912.2099999999998
know what I mean and I've kind of now

1908.83 --> 1916.9299999999998
learned to appreciate that and accept it

1912.21 --> 1919.1100000000001
was very hard to accept it but I'm there

1916.93 --> 1919.1100000000001
now

1922.139 --> 1930.059
so yeah it also means some getting ready

1924.879 --> 1932.9789999999998
for four more steps and for ya just

1930.059 --> 1938.229
figuring out a way how to integrate into

1932.979 --> 1940.419
society as myself without getting peer

1938.229 --> 1944.159
pressured into altering the way I behave

1940.419 --> 1946.719
in any sort of way but still it's like

1944.159 --> 1948.759
getting a broader spectrum in my

1946.719 --> 1950.6490000000001
responses and then finding the right

1948.759 --> 1953.8890000000001
types of responses in the right type of

1950.649 --> 1956.2589999999998
situation so that it is exactly right it

1953.889 --> 1957.9689999999998
is me and it's not going to be

1956.259 --> 1961.869
detrimental it's not like I'm gonna have

1957.969 --> 1964.1190000000001
to have to sacrifice peace in another

1961.869 --> 1968.829
person that they get unrest for just to

1964.119 --> 1970.089
speak the truth you know the middle path

1968.829 --> 1973.719
find another way

1970.089 --> 1978.4189999999999
don't be polarized it's only this or

1973.719 --> 1982.059
that no no no no no you can still find a

1978.419 --> 1984.19
way through if you just think carefully

1982.059 --> 1986.6789999999999
get more Skills get more knowledge

1984.19 --> 1990.0700000000002
you'll figure it out just take it

1986.679 --> 1992.5890000000002
serious don't be hasty don't give up so

1990.07 --> 1996.129
easily in figuring it out and just

1992.589 --> 1998.769
choose to the hard line it or something

1996.129 --> 2001.6789999999999
I know but that's me

1998.769 --> 2002.369
you know maybe other people well they do

2001.679 --> 2004.5590000000002
do it

2002.369 --> 2006.2089999999998
for example Nathan Thompson is kind of

2004.559 --> 2010.379
like that he's really a hardliner he

2006.209 --> 2013.679
just goes into the places just starts

2010.379 --> 2018.6589999999999
talking Flat Earth very eloquently

2013.679 --> 2021.989
that's his thing I I don't know I'm too

2018.659 --> 2024.509
much of a smooth-talking guy I guess I

2021.989 --> 2027.329
doesn't work well for me it only works

2024.509 --> 2030.989
well if I'm really pissed off and then

2027.329 --> 2032.609
it only works if the people know me so

2030.989 --> 2034.049
that and it has to be a good reason for

2032.609 --> 2035.099
it otherwise it's just gonna freak

2034.049 --> 2035.639
everybody out and they're gonna be

2035.099 --> 2042.86
scared

2035.639 --> 2046.6299999999999
missing misunderstand what I am so or

2042.86 --> 2051.02
or I'd have to be I don't know in a

2046.63 --> 2053.03
justice mighty flow of energy and I

2051.02 --> 2057.02
would have to be able to control it and

2053.03 --> 2062.5400000000004
then I might do it you know something

2057.02 --> 2064.129
like that it's just like I would really

2062.54 --> 2065.99
need to be certain that there would be

2064.129 --> 2067.879
at least some people there that would

2065.99 --> 2069.1589999999997
really want that that would appreciate

2067.879 --> 2074.419
that

2069.159 --> 2077.6
you know I because also I need people

2074.419 --> 2080.45
that resonate with me in order to tell

2077.6 --> 2084.649
to use them and in a mirror in it like

2080.45 --> 2086.629
an energy mirror in the moment to see

2084.649 --> 2088.8199999999997
whether I do things right you know

2086.629 --> 2090.71
because as I am going in such a moment

2088.82 --> 2093.409
and just putting it down very eloquently

2090.71 --> 2096.369
I could like make a mistake here and

2093.409 --> 2100.6400000000003
there and if somebody resonates with me

2096.369 --> 2103.28
they will show that that happens face to

2100.64 --> 2105.6189999999997
face it's like they will look like that

2103.28 --> 2108.8300000000004
for a moment or so and then if nobody

2105.619 --> 2112.79
gives a [ __ ] you don't know when you go

2108.83 --> 2116.6
wrong that's my problem that's been my

2112.79 --> 2120.7
problem so I kind of need people to help

2116.6 --> 2120.7
reflect to me how I'm doing

2134.859 --> 2141.38
that's also why it's kind of important

2137.329 --> 2144.26
for me that people are very honest that

2141.38 --> 2148.039
they could care more about that I do it

2144.26 --> 2150.7990000000004
right that I get things right then that

2148.039 --> 2151.67
I get promoted or something that I don't

2150.799 --> 2158.119
lose face

2151.67 --> 2159.77
I don't mind losing face as long as when

2158.119 --> 2161.69
I figure it out

2159.77 --> 2163.7
immediately correct for today I am very

2161.69 --> 2166.88
good at correcting for myself that's

2163.7 --> 2171.25
without losing my energy I'm not afraid

2166.88 --> 2174.289
of making mistakes I'm more afraid that

2171.25 --> 2179.599
people would think that they must cover

2174.289 --> 2184.19
up my mistakes for me I don't like that

2179.599 --> 2187.039
at all because I'm makes me feel very

2184.19 --> 2190.25
ashamed when I realized that I did

2187.039 --> 2192.4700000000003
something really stupid and not just

2190.25 --> 2194.27
from a certain perspective but just when

2192.47 --> 2196.5789999999997
things sink in that I feel stupid about

2194.27 --> 2199.4
it and nobody said anything to just let

2196.579 --> 2201.44
me do it I don't like that at all

2199.4 --> 2203.119
because that makes me feel like they

2201.44 --> 2207.349
either don't respect me or they think

2203.119 --> 2209.799
that I can't handle my own mistakes you

2207.349 --> 2209.799
know what I mean

2246.14 --> 2253.8799999999997
all right well Gideon's sick you're

2250.49 --> 2256.609
completely right with that yeah I know

2253.88 --> 2258.319
AGM I know it was just you saying it in

2256.609 --> 2261.5789999999997
a clumsy way but I knew what you meant

2258.319 --> 2265.88
but thanks for clarifying that I

2261.579 --> 2267.5890000000004
appreciate that but Gideon sick yeah

2265.88 --> 2269.51
getting success if you're going to do

2267.589 --> 2272.9
something in this world may intentions

2269.51 --> 2276.8590000000004
be love well that's right and you know

2272.9 --> 2279.26
even even when I get really pissed full

2276.859 --> 2282.2599999999998
pissed off and hateful against the world

2279.26 --> 2286.4500000000003
I do realize like where does that come

2282.26 --> 2291.7690000000002
from because me being pissed off and

2286.45 --> 2293.049
just very angry with other people even

2291.769 --> 2297.68
though I don't know them

2293.049 --> 2302.5389999999998
it's not because I don't care no it's

2297.68 --> 2305.569
actually because I do care that's what

2302.539 --> 2310.849
feeds it so much and yeah I've said it

2305.569 --> 2313.009
before it's it's kind of a unique angle

2310.849 --> 2316.1600000000003
to things I haven't heard too many

2313.009 --> 2320.109
people say it but I concluded like even

2316.16 --> 2322.7889999999998
in it's now 15 years ago that hatred

2320.109 --> 2328.5789999999997
real hatred passionate hatred is

2322.789 --> 2331.21
actually love unanswered because

2328.579 --> 2334.19
otherwise it's not hatred it's just

2331.21 --> 2336.039
carelessness it's not caring doesn't

2334.19 --> 2338.599
matter it doesn't touch you

2336.039 --> 2341.4100000000003
that's not hatred real hatred is

2338.599 --> 2346.309
actually caring about something and then

2341.41 --> 2348.68
not being able to gratify the connection

2346.309 --> 2351.38
of a Philidor that that is the real

2348.68 --> 2355.8799999999997
hatred that's where real frustration

2351.38 --> 2360.859
comes from so that is kind of to me is a

2355.88 --> 2362.69
bit of a a calmer downer when I realize

2360.859 --> 2366.17
that's like yeah even if I'm like that

2362.69 --> 2368.779
it is really big yeah because I care so

2366.17 --> 2371.21
it's not evil it would only be evil if I

2368.779 --> 2373.88
let myself be fooled into actually

2371.21 --> 2376.15
acting upon such things that would be

2373.88 --> 2376.15
stupid

2376.63 --> 2388.009
so I don't do that ever I just see it as

2380.96 --> 2398.18
like a nutty moment most anger is rooted

2388.009 --> 2400.7
in fear no I disagree now violence come

2398.18 --> 2404.9199999999996
from fear not anger

2400.7 --> 2404.9199999999996
now anger comes from love

2409.509 --> 2415.179
it's like like this like any real

2412.539 --> 2418.3590000000004
passionate relationship everybody knows

2415.179 --> 2419.9790000000003
this you know everybody that has a

2418.359 --> 2421.929
relation that I don't know everybody

2419.979 --> 2424.269
over 20 at least everybody that has a

2421.929 --> 2428.409
passionate relationship compared to just

2424.269 --> 2430.9289999999996
a just trust in friendship passion sex

2428.409 --> 2433.029
all that yeah there's gonna be a lot of

2430.929 --> 2434.799
arguing and probably gonna be very

2433.029 --> 2440.259
heated and doesn't necessarily violent

2434.799 --> 2445.569
that's because they care hatred and

2440.259 --> 2448.389
anger is love unanswered it's it's love

2445.569 --> 2450.849
that's frustrated can't connect so it's

2448.389 --> 2453.609
gonna express itself in anger it's like

2450.849 --> 2457.449
anger is like a desperate attempt to

2453.609 --> 2461.88
over to break a barrier that holds

2457.449 --> 2467.669
things back is up it's almost like a

2461.88 --> 2471.5190000000002
beast reflex it's like okay I love this

2467.669 --> 2475.719
but it's not working so I'm gonna kind

2471.519 --> 2477.8799999999997
of terrorize it to make it love me like

2475.719 --> 2481.329
causing the Stockholm so it's super

2477.88 --> 2483.699
basic animal behavior in a way but it is

2481.329 --> 2487.599
kind of what that function in a way is

2483.699 --> 2490.2090000000003
it seems to be know its course not good

2487.599 --> 2492.88
to give in to that all fully the only

2490.209 --> 2496.299
really freaking down people do that very

2492.88 --> 2502.449
basic people and they're nobody likes

2496.299 --> 2505.179
them this is a row but yeah that's kind

2502.449 --> 2507.819
of how it seems to work so I always

2505.179 --> 2510.489
conclude no real anger passionate anger

2507.819 --> 2512.709
it is routed in love in care because if

2510.489 --> 2518.259
you don't care if you don't love you

2512.709 --> 2521.2889999999998
can't get passionate like that and it's

2518.259 --> 2527.169
not anger really does not come out of

2521.289 --> 2533.139
fear it's like fear inspires violence

2527.169 --> 2535.959
maybe but anger comes from love and like

2533.139 --> 2539.69
it's like this if you had nothing to

2535.959 --> 2545.24
love and somebody would

2539.69 --> 2547.73
I don't know like how could somebody

2545.24 --> 2552.1699999999996
make you angry if you didn't love

2547.73 --> 2555.859
anything there would be no thing to

2552.17 --> 2557.9
touch you with emotionally no it's only

2555.859 --> 2561.41
when you have something loved and then

2557.9 --> 2563.51
somebody for example threatens you then

2561.41 --> 2565.8489999999997
the anger comes out oh yeah but again

2563.51 --> 2568.55
that's because of the love the love that

2565.849 --> 2573.92
is being threatened to be blocked so

2568.55 --> 2581.3900000000003
then anger arises see without love there

2573.92 --> 2586.25
is no anger I don't know this is this

2581.39 --> 2588.02
just this is my concept my idea about it

2586.25 --> 2592.13
I don't know how well it will resonate

2588.02 --> 2594.23
out there but this is just it's based on

2592.13 --> 2597.5
my personal experiences and what I've

2594.23 --> 2602.349
seen with passion and relations and such

2597.5 --> 2602.349
why it keeps on working you know

2610.92 --> 2615.84
if you had nothing to love you would be

2613.66 --> 2619.2999999999997
dead well you would be dead inside

2615.84 --> 2623.53
that's that's for certain but then again

2619.3 --> 2626.17
that would also mean you're still now

2623.53 --> 2637.03
one could consider that to be depressed

2626.17 --> 2639.46
maybe it's like I'd not if you like I

2637.03 --> 2641.26
don't even want to go there it's just

2639.46 --> 2643.96
like a really depressed person that's

2641.26 --> 2647.4100000000003
like really bad you can't really touch

2643.96 --> 2649.59
them they only their mind touches them

2647.41 --> 2652.87
their own little thing that they're

2649.59 --> 2654.63
getting obsessed with but nothing you

2652.87 --> 2658.81
say really matters to them anymore

2654.63 --> 2663.03
because there is no love no no getting

2658.81 --> 2665.95
sick no love is energy love is energy

2663.03 --> 2667.6600000000003
and when that energy suddenly is

2665.95 --> 2676.18
threatened to be cut off that's when

2667.66 --> 2679.3599999999997
anger comes out no but love when you're

2676.18 --> 2684.19
not drunk on it can give you stillness

2679.36 --> 2687.25
but no it's more peace it's just the

2684.19 --> 2690.52
when you got it through you things clear

2687.25 --> 2694.24
up things purify you get to see more

2690.52 --> 2697.54
clearly that's true but only as long as

2694.24 --> 2700.4799999999996
yeah just there's trust and keeps them

2697.54 --> 2704.29
going and because yeah if suddenly

2700.48 --> 2706.84
situations change badly like something

2704.29 --> 2710.2
really bad happens or whatever yeah that

2706.84 --> 2712.63
love is going to be super frustrated

2710.2 --> 2715.45
like what if for example by some crazy

2712.63 --> 2717.6400000000003
stupid situation you're separated from

2715.45 --> 2724.08
your family and you really can't go back

2717.64 --> 2724.08
anymore oh my god that's

2725.51 --> 2732.3300000000004
dad - no it sounds dramatic but just

2728.91 --> 2734.1299999999997
because of the love there is the anger

2732.33 --> 2737.09
if you have no love then you don't have

2734.13 --> 2737.09
any anger really

2744.19 --> 2751.4900000000002
well write anger more anger is just

2747.2 --> 2756.29
frustration and hate is like condensed

2751.49 --> 2757.25
anger it's anger that's like caught in

2756.29 --> 2761.45
between

2757.25 --> 2764.42
it's like compacted and suddenly it's

2761.45 --> 2766.49
not just anger trying to get its way at

2764.42 --> 2773.51
now it's stuck and then you get the

2766.49 --> 2775.4599999999996
hatred but it's kind of in the same in

2773.51 --> 2779.71
the same thing I'm yeah

2775.46 --> 2779.71
one is the extreme form of the other a

2781.51 --> 2785.3190000000004
sort of I don't know

2791.45 --> 2798.049
I guess anger could be more considered

2794.72 --> 2802.1899999999996
as an expressive thing and hatred more

2798.049 --> 2804.109
of a mind thing and what you feel

2802.19 --> 2809.93
doesn't nature doesn't necessarily have

2804.109 --> 2813.5589999999997
to be expressed but after angry you're

2809.93 --> 2815.299
going to show signs so yeah it's a

2813.559 --> 2820.549
little complex I don't know I have tried

2815.299 --> 2823.43
to put on this thing might have not got

2820.549 --> 2824.569
the perfect terminologies for it but

2823.43 --> 2827.14
it's just something that I was thinking

2824.569 --> 2827.14
about

2846.69 --> 2856.71
that's a good one Gideon sick yes that's

2850.769 --> 2862.2299999999996
right it's it's complex how it works if

2856.71 --> 2865.17
you like love somebody and you love them

2862.23 --> 2867.029
more than God you love them beyond

2865.17 --> 2868.829
anything or you don't believe in God you

2867.029 --> 2872.88
just love them and you obsess over let

2868.829 --> 2874.4100000000003
me do anything then that's that's gonna

2872.88 --> 2879.17
grow how to whack because you become

2874.41 --> 2883.3799999999997
blind to them in a way but if you

2879.17 --> 2887.279
prevent the obsession and love God and

2883.38 --> 2889.049
then kind of through God love them use

2887.279 --> 2891.75
God as a middleman doesn't mean you have

2889.049 --> 2895.95
to literally announce God every time but

2891.75 --> 2900.21
just feel him be aware that he is

2895.95 --> 2905.22
creation that this is all that even the

2900.21 --> 2908.9700000000003
relation is like a gift and then it

2905.22 --> 2910.95
works great then it can stay stable and

2908.97 --> 2912.6899999999996
it then it doesn't matter anymore really

2910.95 --> 2914.9399999999996
what happens even to it at certain

2912.69 --> 2918.71
degree because as feelings can still

2914.94 --> 2922.46
change and then the person moves on and

2918.71 --> 2926.13
then yeah you just understand like yeah

2922.46 --> 2926.9700000000003
you know if you get obsessed and they

2926.13 --> 2929.819
move on

2926.97 --> 2936.2099999999996
you break yeah that's what happened to

2929.819 --> 2944.549
me with my ex because I don't know I was

2936.21 --> 2947.66
i I did get kind of obsessed over but

2944.549 --> 2947.66
yeah she was just

2949.27 --> 2954.79
she was amazing in her own ways

2963.68 --> 2972.1699999999996
well that's not true more colored people

2968.36 --> 2977.84
that love you also suffer when you hate

2972.17 --> 2980.66
someone doesn't matter who it's always

2977.84 --> 2984.08
connected hate and love are like always

2980.66 --> 2986.0
connected if nobody loves you it doesn't

2984.08 --> 2987.95
really matter who you hate if there's

2986.0 --> 2990.17
people loving you and you hate somebody

2987.95 --> 2992.06
and you get like really worked up and

2990.17 --> 2994.58
start to reflect on them like I hated

2992.06 --> 2996.5299999999997
person he's Sarah I don't want to kill

2994.58 --> 2998.7999999999997
him or something yeah they're gonna

2996.53 --> 3001.8
that's gonna hurt the people I love you

2998.8 --> 3001.8
yeah

3007.24 --> 3013.18
now they can get used to it maybe see

3010.69 --> 3017.4700000000003
way like okay how can we get this under

3013.18 --> 3021.52
control over time you know how did I get

3017.47 --> 3025.6899999999996
over her haha time Amanda yo time and

3021.52 --> 3029.559
also the realization that it wasn't

3025.69 --> 3033.01
gonna work out anyway because I don't

3029.559 --> 3036.369
know she was in a way to grab it she she

3033.01 --> 3039.13
didn't he really really didn't want any

3036.369 --> 3043.059
kids and it's just a nick nick it's

3039.13 --> 3045.819
unacceptable like in my mind I was

3043.059 --> 3049.3900000000003
trying to somehow try to find a way to

3045.819 --> 3051.73
kind of kind of a shame to say bye I

3049.39 --> 3054.5499999999997
really secretly wanted to mind control

3051.73 --> 3056.26
her into just wanting kids because if

3054.55 --> 3061.869
that would have been there it would have

3056.26 --> 3065.05
been absolutely glorious it wasn't and

3061.869 --> 3067.2400000000002
that kind of broke it because I knew

3065.05 --> 3070.03
like I can't get stuck with this amazing

3067.24 --> 3074.5589999999997
girlfriend forever and not get kids it's

3070.03 --> 3080.829
it's gonna kill me she didn't wanna

3074.559 --> 3083.1090000000004
adopt either so yeah it's just like damn

3080.829 --> 3085.9900000000002
it I got stuck in the perfect relation

3083.109 --> 3090.18
with the ultimate flaw and it just I had

3085.99 --> 3093.0989999999997
to it had to break I didn't want to

3090.18 --> 3095.5589999999997
because I was when I fall in love I fall

3093.099 --> 3098.829
in love and it doesn't stop it really

3095.559 --> 3101.02
doesn't so it was 60 was almost like I

3098.829 --> 3102.94
had to cut off my own arm or something

3101.02 --> 3110.71
in a way I didn't break up with her but

3102.94 --> 3113.01
I allowed it to break because I had no

3110.71 --> 3113.01
choice

3117.85 --> 3123.17
and besides she didn't really she didn't

3121.34 --> 3125.1800000000003
want to go along with Flat Earth either

3123.17 --> 3128.09
yeah because I didn't bring it up back

3125.18 --> 3133.91
then for just a moment and then forgot

3128.09 --> 3140.54
about it again remember Eric Dubay video

3133.91 --> 3143.87
I saw in 2000 2011 2012 now 2012 yeah

3140.54 --> 3145.73
yeah yeah I did see it did see it on

3143.87 --> 3148.0699999999997
YouTube even though the video probably

3145.73 --> 3152.68
didn't exist yet because of dark world

3148.07 --> 3155.8700000000003
and I know my girlfriend saw it too yeah

3152.68 --> 3158.41
my life is weird

3155.87 --> 3158.41
[ __ ]

3169.64 --> 3173.95
Wow big family mark colored

3184.05 --> 3188.61
in a way I wish I had a big family if we

3186.75 --> 3190.23
had a big family the family would

3188.61 --> 3195.75
probably still be together

3190.23 --> 3198.39
but yeah the way my parents were now

3195.75 --> 3204.84
that's not gonna work it already didn't

3198.39 --> 3208.97
kind of work right on like I have an

3204.84 --> 3208.9700000000003
older half-brother from another father

3209.27 --> 3220.32
and yeah my father just for some reason

3215.15 --> 3223.71
he yeah the thing happened remember I

3220.32 --> 3226.4700000000003
talked about it in 15 December like my

3223.71 --> 3228.23
dad when I was born apparently or the

3226.47 --> 3231.5099999999998
when I could was conceived something

3228.23 --> 3235.76
clicked there was like this karmic

3231.51 --> 3241.26
contract with God himself and just he

3235.76 --> 3244.28
closed off in a specific way and that

3241.26 --> 3247.7700000000004
caused him to kind of want to get away

3244.28 --> 3250.5
he C sought out isolation he was kind of

3247.77 --> 3253.44
a bad dad at that and in a time when it

3250.5 --> 3256.05
was like really emphasized on TV like oh

3253.44 --> 3262.98
you stupid dad your dad is bad and who

3256.05 --> 3265.7400000000002
needs dads and so it was like why why is

3262.98 --> 3268.8
he like that I hated my dad back then

3265.74 --> 3271.02
hate unanswered love absolutely because

3268.8 --> 3274.53
I did love him I just couldn't connect

3271.02 --> 3281.1
to him and so it wasn't yeah big family

3274.53 --> 3285.8100000000004
wasn't gonna work out anyway and yeah I

3281.1 --> 3287.609
was already so much I was already more

3285.81 --> 3289.56
too much to handle my brother was kind

3287.609 --> 3292.89
of good you know my brother was a that

3289.56 --> 3296.58
was a good kid in a way he was a really

3292.89 --> 3298.29
good kid I I don't know I was considered

3296.58 --> 3301.44
more as like the the weirdo half

3298.29 --> 3308.31
artistic genius kid that is out of

3301.44 --> 3312.0
control and yeah that's like two people

3308.31 --> 3316.25
I guess that with my arrival my parents

3312.0 --> 3316.25
thought like yeah let's not get any more

3316.82 --> 3322.0800000000004
they already knew as soon as I like came

3319.68 --> 3324.6299999999997
out because yeah as soon as I was born

3322.08 --> 3327.12
the first thing I did is like open my

3324.63 --> 3331.05
eyes and stare my parents straight in

3327.12 --> 3345.7799999999997
the eyes like that so they knew it's

3331.05 --> 3350.52
like oh oh we got a big one yeah Wow

3345.78 --> 3355.5
our time is flown not talked about Flat

3350.52 --> 3357.45
