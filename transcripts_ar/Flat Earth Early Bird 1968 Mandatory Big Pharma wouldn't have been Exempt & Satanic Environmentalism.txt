268.36 --> 271.72
you right

272.32 --> 277.36
yeah man I was just

274.36 --> 277.36
watching

281.36 --> 286.56
video from mind unveiled very

288.759 --> 293.96000000000004
interesting but about more yeah colossal

292.479 --> 298.44
structures

293.96 --> 301.84
and suspicious backstories to them

298.44 --> 304.36
especially the colossal bathtub like man

301.84 --> 307.11999999999995
I remember bumping into that into the 9s

304.36 --> 310.84000000000003
not literally physically

307.12 --> 312.24
but getting informed about it like that

310.84 --> 315.79999999999995
thing freaked me

312.24 --> 320.96000000000004
out it's like what is

315.8 --> 320.96000000000004
this made me think like is that for a

323.479 --> 329.8
giant cuz it seems like like that

330.4 --> 333.23999999999995
but yeah great

334.24 --> 339.199
video very

336.8 --> 342.24
meticulous it's an interesting thing

339.199 --> 345.08000000000004
also about like a

342.24 --> 349.0
Thunderstone like some very

345.08 --> 349.0
vague Shadows Of

349.63 --> 355.199
[Music]

352.199 --> 355.199
Memories

358.28 --> 364.67999999999995
strange he all caps it so I'm I'm sure

361.36 --> 366.52000000000004
he's going to come back to that that's a

364.68 --> 369.88
very interesting

366.52 --> 372.039
thing basically like some kind of

369.88 --> 375.479
lightning storm that then literally

372.039 --> 378.71999999999997
creates a that can

375.479 --> 380.639
create giant stones that come falling

378.72 --> 383.639
from the sky I mean that is pretty

380.639 --> 383.639
magical

390.639 --> 397.44
you think

393.319 --> 399.68
like it's like meteor storm or something

397.44 --> 402.319
it would have probably been based on

399.68 --> 403.759
that or the idea of meteor storm be

402.319 --> 408.03900000000004
based on

403.759 --> 409.8
that so yeah really digging in into some

408.039 --> 412.4
interesting um

409.8 --> 415.0
materials mind unveiled it took a while

412.4 --> 419.08
for them for this

415.0 --> 423.08
video or rather there been quite a bit

419.08 --> 423.08
of time between this and the previous

424.68 --> 431.24
video but they've been

427.039 --> 435.36
busy uh my lunch break also made a

431.24 --> 435.36
video I haven't watched that

436.72 --> 443.08000000000004
yet destroying old world buildings

439.759 --> 443.08000000000004

[Music]

511.52 --> 515.76
all

512.64 --> 518.8389999999999
right take my coffee

515.76 --> 522.279
here I really got to start figuring out

518.839 --> 524.6400000000001
how to like not go to bed so super late

522.279 --> 524.64
it's

527.6 --> 532.519
like it's like measurably slowing me

530.44 --> 534.2790000000001
down during my show so like that's not

532.519 --> 535.839
good like I watched back a lot of

534.279 --> 539.04
yesterday

535.839 --> 542.2
show and there was just so many D silent

539.04 --> 544.4399999999999
pauses it was like I have to be fair it

542.2 --> 544.44
was

544.72 --> 548.72
unwatchable I mean maybe if you like to

547.0 --> 551.88
have that in the background while doing

548.72 --> 551.88
something else but I

554.32 --> 559.2
mean I got to do something about all the

557.0 --> 562.079
silent pauses somehow I got to figure

559.2 --> 563.6800000000001
out how to change

562.079 --> 566.3199999999999
this

563.68 --> 569.3199999999999
cuz yeah yesterday it was kind of

566.32 --> 569.32
unwatchable

570.8 --> 574.959
no I don't watch Fed moon

578.68 --> 585.0
rover I do typically check out during my

581.959 --> 587.0
show what they're up to for a bit

585.0 --> 591.2
somewhere in between but I don't

587.0 --> 591.2
actually just watch it

604.76 --> 607.87
[Music]

626.519 --> 629.519
baseball

633.32 --> 637.48
I use I used to like those types of

635.16 --> 640.399
games playing them actually clutch when

637.48 --> 642.48
I was younger it's just that I don't

640.399 --> 645.68
like watching those

642.48 --> 648.6800000000001
games but I'm not a big sports

645.68 --> 648.68
fan

656.44 --> 662.639
so yeah don't forget to share it the

658.959 --> 665.88
show and Rogan's it up damn

662.639 --> 668.519

Jesus reaction video oh oh maybe I oh

678.12 --> 684.76
guys let's do a vote right

680.839 --> 687.8800000000001
now maybe I can do some reaction videos

684.76 --> 692.2
to other people making

687.88 --> 692.2
things is that what you come here

695.76 --> 703.48
for to have Arwin be the last show that

700.56 --> 706.399
does exactly the same thing as everybody

703.48 --> 710.519
else does is is that what you want me to

706.399 --> 713.56
do same thing as everybody

710.519 --> 717.88
else I don't know about you guys or if

713.56 --> 719.6389999999999
you're even listening to me at all but I

717.88 --> 722.079
don't

719.639 --> 725.92
I don't particularly want to be exactly

722.079 --> 725.92
like every other damn show on

735.4 --> 740.519
[Music]

737.48 --> 743.0790000000001
YouTube and besides every freaking time

740.519 --> 747.12
I play anything like a song or whatever

743.079 --> 752.199
like I immediately get strike

747.12 --> 752.199
nonsense copyright [ __ ] I'm sick of

753.57 --> 756.69
[Music]

769.079 --> 773.68
it okay well it seems you guys are

771.639 --> 778.12
having your own conversation not really

773.68 --> 778.12
paying attention fine whatever

779.32 --> 783.1990000000001
how many cant for N

786.199 --> 792.4399999999999
Buck

788.199 --> 792.4399999999999
well I can get three for

804.12 --> 809.8
10 you like my opinion on those videos

813.959 --> 816.959
well you could just

824.519 --> 833.24
ask couldn't you just like transcribe

828.0 --> 833.24
something that was said for example

840.56 --> 845.7199999999999
hello borders boy

842.56 --> 845.7199999999999
[Music]

871.48 --> 878.6800000000001
you love the movie was good yeah it was

874.48 --> 878.6800000000001
great I found memories of

881.839 --> 886.34
that I I don't know about any Willow the

884.839 --> 889.24
series

886.34 --> 892.36
[Music]

889.24 --> 897.44
but if that's Disney

892.36 --> 901.04
then I mean was it worse than the uh the

897.44 --> 901.0400000000001
new Lord of the Rings thing

901.72 --> 906.399
rings of

903.32 --> 909.8000000000001
power if it was like on that level then

906.399 --> 909.8
yeah I I don't even want to

919.04 --> 925.519
know do you think Tyson's still what are

923.68 --> 927.8389999999999
you talking about health

925.519 --> 930.92
lunabar are you talking about Neil the

927.839 --> 933.519
grass Tyson or some freaking sports

930.92 --> 936.4399999999999
player cuz if it's some freaking sports

933.519 --> 936.44
player I don't

945.8 --> 950.8
know and as for Neil theg grass Tyson

948.6 --> 953.16
like yeah it all depends on what you

950.8 --> 957.7589999999999
think he's

953.16 --> 957.759
got iron White

961.8 --> 967.4399999999999
I mean Tyson does not have much of an

964.12 --> 967.44
argument he just

967.48 --> 974.04
has heliocentric conceptual minute

971.48 --> 976.9590000000001
distractions typically that's what Neil

974.04 --> 981.0
de grass Tyson does and he has the

976.959 --> 981.0
supposed sexy voice way of

981.199 --> 986.199
talking but I

983.04 --> 990.92
mean the more time passes the more he

986.199 --> 990.92
runs out of things to say though

994.24 --> 998.519
like in the earlier days like he was

996.519 --> 1000.8
really popular people would hang on

998.519 --> 1003.319
every word and that's not that's going

1000.8 --> 1006.079
to fade away more and more over time

1003.319 --> 1008.279
because people are just informed about

1006.079 --> 1008.279
the

1012.399 --> 1018.519
argumentation the know he's just like

1014.519 --> 1018.519
fooling around really

1021.48 --> 1026.079
but maybe you

1023.52 --> 1028.16
weren't talking about Neil theg grass

1026.079 --> 1030.48
Tyson I mean why would you talk about

1028.16 --> 1033.039
that on a on a flat Earth

1030.48 --> 1036.039
show when you could be talking about

1033.039 --> 1036.039
sports

1055.24 --> 1061.2
bump anybody here bumped into any silly

1057.64 --> 1061.2
Arwin meme videos

1062.0 --> 1068.039
yet of my rant about physicality

1065.08 --> 1072.24
assumption bias and it's going to be

1068.039 --> 1076.32
physical physical I mean I watched that

1072.24 --> 1079.08
back and I was pretty ballistic with

1076.32 --> 1081.28
that

1079.08 --> 1083.76
so it definitely does deserve its own

1081.28 --> 1085.44
meme video I totally agree with the

1083.76 --> 1089.72
trolls out

1085.44 --> 1089.72
there if they're actually doing

1094.32 --> 1102.3999999999999
that I would like to know more about

1098.44 --> 1106.0
rdd relative density dise

1102.4 --> 1109.6000000000001
equilibrium are you a fan

1106.0 --> 1112.44
what what a fan of relative density dis

1109.6 --> 1115.4399999999998
am I a fan of falling and

1112.44 --> 1115.44
Rising

1117.64 --> 1121.72
okay not

1119.52 --> 1124.52
particularly although yeah a world

1121.72 --> 1126.44
without it would kind of be freaky but

1124.52 --> 1128.679
yeah I have fear of height so I'm not a

1126.44 --> 1133.3600000000001
particular fan of relative density

1128.679 --> 1133.3600000000001
disequilibrium if you know what I mean

1147.36 --> 1154.52
I was on it yesterday yeah yeah well I

1150.36 --> 1154.52
had some frustration with barded

1155.44 --> 1161.3600000000001
behavior and I was overreacting a little

1159.12 --> 1164.3999999999999
which happens sometimes sometimes I just

1161.36 --> 1164.3999999999999
really can't take

1166.88 --> 1171.7600000000002
it and then I might choose choose to go

1170.039 --> 1174.28
a little

1171.76 --> 1176.1589999999999
silly what's that

1225.2 --> 1229.76
of the guy that's going to be enough

1233.84 --> 1239.6789999999999

1236.52 --> 1239.679
complain about the

1240.4 --> 1245.76
left and tell us all how the whole

1243.84 --> 1249.1589999999999
government is projecting all its

1245.76 --> 1251.44
nonsense onto the right wing when they

1249.159 --> 1253.8400000000001
are the ones that are actually doing it

1251.44 --> 1257.8400000000001

oh 53 seconds of some guy talking about

1338.24 --> 1341.72
Biden inflation

1353.679 --> 1358.8400000000001
I don't know what's going on here this

1355.88 --> 1358.8400000000001
is all very

1361.96 --> 1368.2
weird watch the why why should I [ __ ]

1365.48 --> 1368.2
watch the whole

1368.76 --> 1376.2
video the whole less than a minute

1372.799 --> 1379.2
video why I'm not going to watch it with

1376.2 --> 1379.2
sound

1384.95 --> 1390.599
[Music]

1395.919 --> 1400.279
can you ask a question about the

1397.88 --> 1402.7990000000002
holographic sun and moon

1400.279 --> 1405.44
idea yeah you can always

1402.799 --> 1408.72
try hey I'm just glad you guys are

1405.44 --> 1412.799
asking questions I mean I might actually

1408.72 --> 1415.919
be able to do a show today without any

1412.799 --> 1419.2
more than 2 minute silent pauses this

1415.919 --> 1422.2
way if you guys actually keep talking

1419.2 --> 1424.76
and asking questions I mean go ahead

1422.2 --> 1426.24
like I don't have to necessarily like

1424.76 --> 1429.1589999999999
the questions as long as you're not

1426.24 --> 1431.76
intending to troll me that's

1429.159 --> 1434.0
fine right just because I'm a grouchy

1431.76 --> 1436.039
mood doesn't mean that I don't want you

1434.0 --> 1439.08
guys to ask

1436.039 --> 1441.44
questions it just means that I'm not

1439.08 --> 1443.12
particularly in a position to handle

1441.44 --> 1446.2
those questions all that well it doesn't

1443.12 --> 1448.7199999999998
mean that I don't want you to ask

1446.2 --> 1451.72
questions it's just that I might

1448.72 --> 1451.72
overreact a

1460.78 --> 1465.24
[Music]

1462.88 --> 1467.3990000000001
little how do you suppose the

1465.24 --> 1470.08
holographic Moon blocks the sun in an

1467.399 --> 1472.559
eclipse if if it's not solid and only

1470.08 --> 1476.84
light Oh you

1472.559 --> 1479.84
mean okay let me rephrase the orles W's

1476.84 --> 1483.559
question there how do you suppose the

1479.84 --> 1487.4399999999998
holographic Moon that's not there and

1483.559 --> 1490.52
detectable in any form for 3 Days even

1487.44 --> 1493.3200000000002
though somebody about it lied about that

1490.52 --> 1497.8799999999999
they did actually detect it in those 3

1493.32 --> 1500.96
days when it's missing so how does the

1497.88 --> 1505.3600000000001
holog graic Moon that's not

1500.96 --> 1507.279
there block the Sun during an eclipse if

1505.36 --> 1510.1999999999998
it's not solid yeah yeah that's a

1507.279 --> 1513.48
complicated question isn't it how does

1510.2 --> 1517.24
the holographic Sun that's not

1513.48 --> 1518.48
there measurably detectably there how

1517.24 --> 1522.919
does it

1518.48 --> 1525.799
block the sun if it's not physical and

1522.919 --> 1529.0
not there yeah that's a good question

1525.799 --> 1530.96
well might have something to do with

1529.0 --> 1533.159
that the moon's not there so it has

1530.96 --> 1535.3990000000001
nothing to do with it blocking the sun

1533.159 --> 1538.3200000000002
it doesn't block the sun that's a

1535.399 --> 1538.32
heliocentric

1539.52 --> 1545.08
myth

1542.36 --> 1547.52
right but let's just say there is a

1545.08 --> 1550.6
Celestial body there somehow that you

1547.52 --> 1553.96
can't see how does it

1550.6 --> 1556.76
block another Celestial body if it's not

1553.96 --> 1559.64
physical well it's not blocking it the

1556.76 --> 1562.96
blocking idea is part of physicality

1559.64 --> 1566.44
assumption bias what it is actually is

1562.96 --> 1569.3600000000001
an alteration to the angular

1566.44 --> 1572.64
manifestation you could think of it as

1569.36 --> 1575.52
one Celestial negating another

1572.64 --> 1580.039
Celestial partially part in the Hologram

1575.52 --> 1583.559
and the light angular light output

1580.039 --> 1585.2
because or rather comparable not even

1583.559 --> 1589.6399999999999
because I can't even go there I don't

1585.2 --> 1592.44
know but comparable to like a

1589.64 --> 1594.88
Polaroid uh

1592.44 --> 1597.76
glass

1594.88 --> 1601.0800000000002
covering something I don't even know the

1597.76 --> 1603.8799999999999
right words for it like a polar

1601.08 --> 1604.76
polarized light lens effect that can

1603.88 --> 1607.24
just

1604.76 --> 1609.039
negate something

1607.24 --> 1613.559
else

1609.039 --> 1615.76
visually right so it's it's but I mean

1613.559 --> 1618.84
they're both angular manifestations

1615.76 --> 1622.2
they're then crossing paths

1618.84 --> 1625.559
and it's in the rules of how those

1622.2 --> 1628.0800000000002
things work those angular holographic

1625.559 --> 1630.799
manifestations that one negates the

1628.08 --> 1634.039
other negates the light that then would

1630.799 --> 1637.0
have been emanating from one of the

1634.039 --> 1640.8799999999999
celestials and emanating is even already

1637.0 --> 1640.88
physically assumption bias based

1641.559 --> 1649.279
word because that suggests that's a

1644.679 --> 1651.88
position but yeah it negates part of the

1649.279 --> 1651.88
angular

1652.159 --> 1657.7600000000002
manifestation it doesn't block it it

1655.36 --> 1662.9189999999999
just negates

1657.76 --> 1666.24
it and the way it looks just yeah it it

1662.919 --> 1669.88
will remind you in your memory in your

1666.24 --> 1673.039
physical go about looking with your eyes

1669.88 --> 1675.7600000000002
memory of like hey that kind of looks

1673.039 --> 1678.8799999999999
like if a light was getting blocked by a

1675.76 --> 1680.96
sphere or a disc like yeah yeah it kind

1678.88 --> 1683.24
of does look like that doesn't it yeah

1680.96 --> 1685.2
doesn't mean that that's what's going on

1683.24 --> 1688.279
but that's certainly the impression your

1685.2 --> 1692.24
physicality assumption bias

1688.279 --> 1696.32
based spatial

1692.24 --> 1698.88
brain tells you tells your conscious

1696.32 --> 1701.6399999999999
after its processed the visuals that's

1698.88 --> 1705.279
what that part of your brain tells you

1701.64 --> 1708.159
yeah so you could definitely think and

1705.279 --> 1710.039
feel of it like an object blocking a

1708.159 --> 1714.0390000000002
light source cuz that is like the

1710.039 --> 1714.039
closest thing that it will remind you

1718.679 --> 1724.76
of I hope that actually answered your

1722.76 --> 1727.679
question orle Bumble was a bit of a

1724.76 --> 1727.679
chore to get through

1731.36 --> 1736.6789999999999
it but it's a good question I mean it's

1734.08 --> 1736.6789999999999
a fair

1736.72 --> 1742.32
question thank you for that that that

1739.6 --> 1742.32
makes up for

1742.519 --> 1749.919
your alleged deliberate

1746.36 --> 1752.36
lies about having measured the moon

1749.919 --> 1754.3600000000001
somehow in the 3 days when it's gone

1752.36 --> 1757.9189999999999
that literally nobody in the world has

1754.36 --> 1760.039
even with like infrared cameras and

1757.919 --> 1763.159
UltraViolet [ __ ]

1760.039 --> 1767.039
yeah nothing there is no moon there in

1763.159 --> 1770.5590000000002
any form in those 3 days

1767.039 --> 1774.559
so whenever abala says oh no you did do

1770.559 --> 1777.6789999999999
that yeah then I know like knowing

1774.559 --> 1781.32
absolute knowing that that's a lie

1777.679 --> 1783.799
that's a hopeful wish because you

1781.32 --> 1785.399
probably don't know then if you make a

1783.799 --> 1787.559
statement like that that that's

1785.399 --> 1788.4799999999998
absolutely impossible that nobody's ever

1787.559 --> 1791.9189999999999
done

1788.48 --> 1795.24
that so that's probably a hopeful wish

1791.919 --> 1798.159
out of ignorance but technically it is a

1795.24 --> 1801.2
lie it's a lie born out of sloppiness

1798.159 --> 1801.2
when somebody says

1801.679 --> 1810.1200000000001
that have you had my what the [ __ ] no I

1805.799 --> 1814.0
have not my Illuminati cant is still

1810.12 --> 1817.4799999999998
here and I'm going to Chow Down On

1814.0 --> 1819.12
It hologram should be easy for a what

1817.48 --> 1823.72
what does the hell does that even mean

1819.12 --> 1823.7199999999998
easy for AI what

1832.039 --> 1838.0
can AI make its

1834.6 --> 1840.0
Holograms Sun what what the [ __ ] do you

1838.0 --> 1844.97
mean

1840.0 --> 1848.559
AI what is this AI you're talking

1844.97 --> 1848.559
[Music]

1850.279 --> 1861.44
about cuz I mean AI is

1854.919 --> 1864.72
a like a virtual Alor Alm thing like in

1861.44 --> 1867.72
a digital space like the in information

1864.72 --> 1870.279
based electronic space that's not

1867.72 --> 1873.519
actually physically anywhere it's kind

1870.279 --> 1876.0
of strange question like how does the

1873.519 --> 1879.08
thing that exists purely

1876.0 --> 1882.12
within a virtual electric space not in

1879.08 --> 1885.12
the physical world how does it create a

1882.12 --> 1889.4399999999998
hologram what like how the hell are you

1885.12 --> 1892.26
tying that into that in any way it's so

1889.44 --> 1894.0
bizarre to ask a question like

1892.26 --> 1898.08
[Music]

1894.0 --> 1900.24
that I mean you're using sophisticated

1898.08 --> 1902.559
subjects and words but it kind of seems

1900.24 --> 1905.559
like a six-year-old just trying to Ram

1902.559 --> 1908.6
that sphere through the cube

1905.559 --> 1911.08
block like what the hell does one have

1908.6 --> 1914.559
to do with the other like absolutely

1911.08 --> 1917.96
nothing I don't understand that You' put

1914.559 --> 1917.96
those together

1928.12 --> 1935.08
Holograms have a physical Source yeah

1931.519 --> 1937.159
the holographic machines that people

1935.08 --> 1940.799
make

1937.159 --> 1942.96
yeah hologram generators are a physical

1940.799 --> 1946.039
Source that's

1942.96 --> 1949.48
right but yeah I'm not

1946.039 --> 1952.799
claiming nor does my idea claim that

1949.48 --> 1956.799
that is the exact nature of the

1952.799 --> 1960.08
celestials it's just the closest

1956.799 --> 1962.399
thing that is tangible to us that could

1960.08 --> 1962.399
be

1965.44 --> 1969.24
compared super derp

1973.2 --> 1979.8400000000001
award yeah what about the other people

1976.559 --> 1979.84
on the other side of

1985.24 --> 1992.96
although that depends seeking sty water

1988.48 --> 1992.96
on how you're going to interpret that

1993.88 --> 1999.0800000000002
question cuz as side I mean what side Oh

1998.08 --> 2002.279
you

1999.08 --> 2006.08
mean the north side the South Side the

2002.279 --> 2009.159
east side west side or you mean on the

2006.08 --> 2011.9189999999999
other side of the day

2009.159 --> 2015.0800000000002
upside down Flat

2011.919 --> 2017.159
Earth a very strange way of thinking

2015.08 --> 2020.519
like that the upside down world I've

2017.159 --> 2023.48
heard people about that

2020.519 --> 2025.679
okay like that's even in my Dark World

2023.48 --> 2029.72
Vision in the earlier time that was very

2025.679 --> 2029.72
strange they said it was the upside

2031.0 --> 2035.84
down

2032.96 --> 2038.559
like it's probably like in the other

2035.84 --> 2040.48
dimension upside down because physically

2038.559 --> 2045.039
but it was suggested that it's like a

2040.48 --> 2046.039
mirror world that is upside down that's

2045.039 --> 2048.96
how I

2046.039 --> 2051.079
originally got the first preliminary

2048.96 --> 2055.159
information about figuring out what the

2051.079 --> 2055.159
Dark World was is that is what they

2056.079 --> 2063.28
said and it's like okay like like my

2063.44 --> 2068.639
physics understanding was very tintilla

2066.2 --> 2071.919
and frustrated at that notion like what

2068.639 --> 2075.159
the hell you mean upside down like

2071.919 --> 2078.2799999999997
literally on the other on the bottom

2075.159 --> 2080.28
side of the world like

2078.28 --> 2083.96
what

2080.28 --> 2087.159
how how does any of this make any sense

2083.96 --> 2089.599
but later in my mind at least I started

2087.159 --> 2092.7200000000003
to realize like no it's not literally

2089.599 --> 2094.3590000000004
the upside down like it's not a physical

2092.72 --> 2097.7999999999997
designation

2094.359 --> 2100.119
it's it's really more a a reference to a

2097.8 --> 2103.2400000000002
reversed

2100.119 --> 2107.2000000000003
world it's more like inside

2103.24 --> 2110.0789999999997
out and it's not a spatial designation

2107.2 --> 2112.839
the upside down that's what I had to

2110.079 --> 2112.8390000000004
realize much

2114.64 --> 2120.64
later but it was an idea

2118.16 --> 2123.16
originally like during the freaking Dark

2120.64 --> 2127.7999999999997
World experiences which

2123.16 --> 2127.7999999999997
is strange anyway

2135.359 --> 2141.56
is it some place nearby you could walk

2138.24 --> 2141.56
up to

2142.48 --> 2150.0
what yeah EO Plaza he lunar it's a

2147.28 --> 2153.0
supermarket organic supermarket chain

2150.0 --> 2153.0
store

2153.09 --> 2160.6800000000003
[Music]

2158.56 --> 2162.16
some of them have it I think most of

2160.68 --> 2164.2
them I think they have that pretty

2162.16 --> 2167.56
standard they have like a bakery part

2164.2 --> 2169.7999999999997
with with like an oven in every

2167.56 --> 2172.68
supermarket

2169.8 --> 2174.92
and they'll probably have Illuminati

2172.68 --> 2177.68
cant although it won't be called

2174.92 --> 2177.6800000000003
Illuminati

2178.599 --> 2184.599
CLE but you're going to have to figure

2180.76 --> 2184.599
that one out yourself

2201.92 --> 2207.16
okay but I'm going to take a bite out of

2204.4 --> 2210.44
it I just want to continue this round

2207.16 --> 2212.3999999999996
because I think it's been pretty fluid

2210.44 --> 2215.4
show and I want to keep it fluid I don't

2212.4 --> 2219.88
want to have any silent

2215.4 --> 2219.88
pauses or barely any if

2231.22 --> 2234.85
[Music]

2237.16 --> 2244.3999999999996
possible so any follow up on

2240.56 --> 2247.04
that no statements did Gary do

2244.4 --> 2249.76
music like what the hell do do you mean

2247.04 --> 2253.04
hologram should be easy for

2249.76 --> 2255.5200000000004
AI and what do you mean other side of

2253.04 --> 2255.52
the Flat

2258.2 --> 2264.56
Earth or is this where where the chat

2260.92 --> 2268.28
just dies this where you all just walk

2264.56 --> 2272.44
away I mean I am actually addressing

2268.28 --> 2272.44
what you're saying live

2285.079 --> 2293.96
what can chat gbt impersonate an ice

2288.64 --> 2297.0
cream [ __ ] before ice cream pikies exist

2293.96 --> 2297.0
the Hologram

2297.52 --> 2303.88
what that's a joke I take it that that's

2300.88 --> 2303.88
funny

2320.24 --> 2324.7999999999997
that's your derp joke SL

2328.119 --> 2333.96
Holograms similar to gen AI a I

2334.48 --> 2341.2400000000002
would what do you mean mean with that

2338.96 --> 2343.599
Heth Lun like what the [ __ ] does that

2341.24 --> 2343.5989999999997
even

2346.56 --> 2353.2
mean I mean you're using Holograms like

2350.8 --> 2356.88
what the hell is the freaking context of

2353.2 --> 2359.52
that like it is so loose the context

2356.88 --> 2363.4
like that could mean anything it doesn't

2359.52 --> 2363.4
specify anything

2382.599 --> 2389.56
okay H Hogan got an AI

2386.04 --> 2395.0
simulation talking about my Illuminati

2389.56 --> 2395.0
sank you mean my Illuminati Kasa

2395.96 --> 2401.04
okay uh what the [ __ ] does that have to

2398.599 --> 2405.28
do with hologram that's

2401.04 --> 2405.2799999999997
called a a character

2408.28 --> 2412.079
simulator right you have to have the

2410.24 --> 2414.4399999999996
right voice database you have to have

2412.079 --> 2419.76
the right visual imagery and then yeah

2414.44 --> 2422.599
the AI can then back engineer a

2419.76 --> 2425.7200000000003
simulation yeah I know that's possible

2422.599 --> 2430.2000000000003
like that's not a hologram that has

2425.72 --> 2430.2
absolutely nothing to to do with

2431.2 --> 2439.4399999999996
Holograms yeah if it's on a

2436.2 --> 2443.359
screen wherever you do yeah like oh I'm

2439.44 --> 2446.44
going to watch a video yeah guess what

2443.359 --> 2450.48
that's called a

2446.44 --> 2452.04
video not a hologram if it's a video

2450.48 --> 2454.839
it's not a

2452.04 --> 2459.079
hologram because the Hologram is about

2454.839 --> 2460.7599999999998
the format of the visual if it's a video

2459.079 --> 2463.1600000000003
and you're playing it on your phone or

2460.76 --> 2465.92
you're putting it on your monitor it's

2463.16 --> 2468.0
not a hologram why the hell would you

2465.92 --> 2470.4
call that a hologram that's just

2468.0 --> 2475.359
extremely

2470.4 --> 2475.359
confusing why are you doing this

2492.599 --> 2497.48
it's a character

2494.4 --> 2499.079
simulator yeah AI character simulator

2497.48 --> 2502.44
yeah yeah we know that's there they've

2499.079 --> 2504.92
been doing that for like a decade or

2502.44 --> 2508.0
whatever and it's getting really quick

2504.92 --> 2511.599
and fluid now and with some simulations

2508.0 --> 2516.88
you'd almost think it was the real thing

2511.599 --> 2516.88
almost yeah I know it's making progress

2519.52 --> 2525.359
before you know it you're just going to

2521.48 --> 2527.76
have to like ask somebody live to

2525.359 --> 2530.88
confirm whether some video is really

2527.76 --> 2533.28
them doing that or not because the

2530.88 --> 2536.2400000000002
character simulators will become

2533.28 --> 2538.3190000000004
potentially extremely accurate for some

2536.24 --> 2540.2799999999997
individuals so that it will be

2538.319 --> 2542.16
indistinguishable from the real person

2540.28 --> 2545.8390000000004
so you're just going to have to ask them

2542.16 --> 2548.7999999999997
did you actually do that or is that a

2545.839 --> 2552.52
simulation and then trust them on that

2548.8 --> 2552.52
yeah we're we're in that

2557.559 --> 2563.559
era all right anyway I'm going to take a

2559.839 --> 2563.5589999999997
bite out of this cheers

2597.68 --> 2601.7599999999998
[ __ ] kid oh so

2602.119 --> 2607.6400000000003
that's

2604.319 --> 2611.44
yeah why do I have to watch that though

2607.64 --> 2611.44
it's a guy whining about ice

2612.319 --> 2618.52
cream why do I have to watch that why

2614.8 --> 2618.52
are you reposting that I don't get

2629.38 --> 2632.429
[Music]

2632.52 --> 2639.04
it okay so you're saying it's an AI

2635.68 --> 2639.04
altered video

2644.04 --> 2647.5589999999997
oh it's just a guy in the

2649.04 --> 2655.8
beginning a little girl being very angry

2651.96 --> 2658.92
over ice cream being too expensive or

2655.8 --> 2658.92
something I

2659.48 --> 2666.16
mean I don't understand why you guys

2662.16 --> 2666.16
keep bringing up this video

2677.8 --> 2680.6800000000003
it's about the little girl ranting like

2679.68 --> 2683.68
a

2680.68 --> 2683.68
gangster

2684.319 --> 2689.079
okay yeah that's what you get when you

2686.839 --> 2690.52
just freely let out these [ __ ]

2689.079 --> 2693.319
criminal

2690.52 --> 2695.64
examples total gangster scumbags out

2693.319 --> 2698.16
there and that's like legal and then

2695.64 --> 2701.68
yeah little kids then are like oh hey

2698.16 --> 2705.68
this is Hardcore the world is [ __ ] up

2701.68 --> 2707.68
like people like generally drop about

2705.68 --> 2709.0789999999997
like oh child torture and like yeah

2707.68 --> 2711.2799999999997
little kids's going to go [ __ ]

2709.079 --> 2714.079
hardcore then yeah that's what exactly

2711.28 --> 2717.599
what kids do it's like kid Soldier

2714.079 --> 2720.28
Behavior yeah they realize the world is

2717.599 --> 2722.3590000000004
[ __ ] nasty and evil and they have to

2720.28 --> 2724.52
be hardcore and so they're going to

2722.359 --> 2727.5989999999997
emulate the most hardcore [ __ ] thing

2724.52 --> 2729.64
that they've bumped into

2727.599 --> 2732.119
which is like a gangster yeah that's

2729.64 --> 2734.16
what happens that's what happens with

2732.119 --> 2737.079
[ __ ] information that just freely

2734.16 --> 2739.1189999999997
goes around for any kid to bump into

2737.079 --> 2741.599
that's exactly what

2739.119 --> 2745.0
happens yeah once they catch on how

2741.599 --> 2748.0
unbelievably [ __ ] the world is that's

2745.0 --> 2751.16
exactly what they do I know all about it

2748.0 --> 2753.319
yeah cuz that's what I did except I

2751.16 --> 2755.8799999999997
didn't bump into [ __ ] gangster of

2753.319 --> 2758.839
horse [ __ ] I bumped into a bunch of

2755.88 --> 2763.88
[ __ ] creepy ass

2758.839 --> 2765.64
satanists that were like still masking

2763.88 --> 2769.559
how [ __ ] up the whole thing was

2765.64 --> 2774.68
partially so otherwise I would yeah

2769.559 --> 2774.6800000000003
whatever was not a pleasant

2777.24 --> 2785.4399999999996
thing yeah it's like Stockholm syndrome

2782.92 --> 2790.52
coping you

2785.44 --> 2790.52
become the dark thing out of

2800.359 --> 2806.88
defense or at least simulated and that

2803.04 --> 2806.88
is what I did simulate

2807.079 --> 2812.88
that CU everybody's [ __ ] scared of

2810.04 --> 2815.48
you then you're not going to get

2812.88 --> 2818.839
bullied you're not going to be the

2815.48 --> 2818.839
bottom [ __ ]

2830.2 --> 2836.319
the cute little okay so whatever I look

2833.24 --> 2839.16
I'm not watching that [ __ ]

2836.319 --> 2841.5589999999997
video live during my

2839.16 --> 2845.359
show and I don't know why the hell you

2841.559 --> 2849.92
guys are so incredibly infatuated with

2845.359 --> 2849.92
it this is really frustrating to

2871.85 --> 2874.889
[Music]

2875.839 --> 2878.839
me

2905.76 --> 2909.76
for e

2945.359 --> 2948.5589999999997
okay I fixed it I can actually watch a

2947.64 --> 2952.7599999999998
video

2948.559 --> 2956.4
now what I did was I just muted all the

2952.76 --> 2958.1600000000003
sound in OBS so I did watch it yeah it

2956.4 --> 2959.92
wasn't as like I don't know what you're

2958.16 --> 2962.839
talking about talking like a gangster

2959.92 --> 2968.7200000000003
that wasn't like a gangster at all that

2962.839 --> 2968.72
was talking like old reddish Folk

2973.16 --> 2977.52
so yeah that's that's just extremely

2979.48 --> 2984.4
British probably the spirit of her

2981.68 --> 2984.3999999999996
grandma or

2989.16 --> 2994.68
something I don't yeah it's not even

2991.52 --> 2998.64
like gangster no it's not even close to

2994.68 --> 2998.64
that not dark so yeah

3000.839 --> 3008.599
I certainly let that suggestion nowhere

3005.48 --> 3010.52
and don't know why I had to make it dark

3008.599 --> 3014.96
I thought it was dark if people talk

3010.52 --> 3014.96
gangster I think darkness and evil

3015.319 --> 3023.359
so wonderful child yeah it's just

3018.96 --> 3023.359
talking oldfashioned like

3024.839 --> 3029.72
that's that's how out raged Brit's

3043.96 --> 3051.079
talk it's gangster yeah heal lunabar

3047.92 --> 3055.4
somebody literally used the word

3051.079 --> 3058.6400000000003
gangster in the chat yeah you're blaming

3055.4 --> 3058.64
me for calling it gangst

3073.44 --> 3079.2000000000003
hope you enjoyed it it's cute I guess

3080.559 --> 3087.559
thanks so I watched it now and now we

3083.559 --> 3087.559
can move on okay

3089.72 --> 3094.68
that must be a culture thing gangster

3091.52 --> 3097.88
doesn't mean necessarily evil or bad

3094.68 --> 3101.72
that's may be technically true but it

3097.88 --> 3104.4
does with me like for Me gangster is

3101.72 --> 3104.3999999999996
evil and

3111.799 --> 3117.68
bad could be an endearment term well

3114.4 --> 3118.92
that's a modern thing then and I find

3117.68 --> 3121.72
that highly

3118.92 --> 3123.92
repulsive yeah that's the same people

3121.72 --> 3128.319
that like to say braah and think that

3123.92 --> 3130.559
that's cool when that's obviously

3128.319 --> 3133.599
gay but

3130.559 --> 3137.119
uh yeah I know some people like to say

3133.599 --> 3140.2000000000003
oh it's old gangster I hate

3137.119 --> 3143.2400000000002
that maybe that's like an old goth

3140.2 --> 3145.0789999999997
First's rap Feud thing or something but

3143.24 --> 3149.5989999999997
I was definitely on the go side I'm like

3145.079 --> 3149.599
yeah I [ __ ] hate gangst I hate

3150.04 --> 3156.119
it I don't like

3152.76 --> 3158.76
that somebody says oh gangster I think

3156.119 --> 3160.319
of just like violence promoting pieces

3158.76 --> 3162.92
of

3160.319 --> 3165.92
[ __ ]

3162.92 --> 3169.92
rape

3165.92 --> 3173.64
murder drug dealing crap that's that's

3169.92 --> 3177.7200000000003
what I think gangster stands for and I

3173.64 --> 3177.72
do not appreciate it

3198.079 --> 3202.6400000000003
anyway okay fber well you could call it

3200.92 --> 3204.839
whatever you

3202.64 --> 3208.1189999999997
want yeah there's another way to

3204.839 --> 3210.92
describe it that kids got a mouth on her

3208.119 --> 3212.839
that's what they say yeah it's a much

3210.92 --> 3216.64
better way to describe she's got a big

3212.839 --> 3219.2
mouth she's just like full

3216.64 --> 3221.48
out yeah she's got a mouth on her and

3219.2 --> 3224.0
that's just like yeah that's that's not

3221.48 --> 3224.0
not

3224.68 --> 3228.9199999999996
gangster yeah she's just got a big mouth

3227.359 --> 3232.359
and that's kind of

3228.92 --> 3234.839
cute until she starts to reject your

3232.359 --> 3237.52
Authority as a parent or whatever then

3234.839 --> 3240.24
it's not so cute then it's just annoying

3237.52 --> 3240.24
but I get

3254.68 --> 3261.5589999999997
it and she did do it very eloquently in

3257.68 --> 3261.5589999999997
the video I have to agree to

3263.119 --> 3270.4
that almost like she was aware that she

3266.92 --> 3270.4
was being a cultural

3270.44 --> 3274.079
representative it she did have that vibe

3272.92 --> 3276.839
to

3274.079 --> 3280.1600000000003
her like she was actually making effort

3276.839 --> 3282.2799999999997
to to be very specifically like that

3280.16 --> 3288.2799999999997
that

3282.28 --> 3288.28
way attuned to that Vibe yeah

3310.559 --> 3313.559
what

3349.599 --> 3352.599
on

3370.71 --> 3373.909

what why are you bringing that

3475.119 --> 3479.1600000000003
up for

3513.44 --> 3516.559
she did

3526.599 --> 3530.039
what what the

3532.64 --> 3536.7599999999998
[ __ ] I didn't hear that in there at all

3535.52 --> 3539.079
so I don't I don't know what you're

3536.76 --> 3539.079
talking

3556.88 --> 3562.96
about I mean seriously I'm getting kind

3559.44 --> 3567.319
of freaked out how much you guys are

3562.96 --> 3569.359
all like obsessed with this video

3567.319 --> 3572.24
cuz it's getting to that point like

3569.359 --> 3574.72
obsession over some girl talking on a

3572.24 --> 3577.2799999999997
video I mean this is getting

3574.72 --> 3578.4399999999996
weird I don't know why I'm spending all

3577.28 --> 3581.799
this

3578.44 --> 3584.039
time like actually having to review that

3581.799 --> 3586.48
video like what is going on with you

3584.039 --> 3589.88
guys why are you so [ __ ] obsessed

3586.48 --> 3589.88
with that video

3597.98 --> 3601.15
[Music]

3616.24 --> 3621.16
really hello seeking star water

3637.319 --> 3641.72
man yeah that Illuminati cound certainly

3639.839 --> 3644.24
hit the

3641.72 --> 3645.8799999999997
spot but I do kind of feel like I need

3644.24 --> 3648.68
more coffee

3645.88 --> 3650.96
but I need to be careful with not

3648.68 --> 3652.9199999999996
overdoing it with the coffee I've

3650.96 --> 3657.92
noticed that it's like

3652.92 --> 3657.92
getting burdens on my system

3659.319 --> 3664.119
with this level on stationary yeah yeah

3661.599 --> 3667.48
and flat geometric orientation of the

3664.119 --> 3669.96
Earth surface is flat there no curvature

3667.48 --> 3672.16
Horizon is not geometrically obstructing

3669.96 --> 3672.16
the

3673.96 --> 3679.52
distance things into the distance right

3687.2 --> 3691.4399999999996
but I mean seeking starwater on the

3688.96 --> 3695.839
other hand I

3691.44 --> 3700.44
mean Alex Jones watched

3695.839 --> 3705.319
Jupiter it's a ball it

3700.44 --> 3707.48
rotated yeah a moon orbited around it he

3705.319 --> 3709.88
saw it through the telescope it has to

3707.48 --> 3709.88
be a

3711.96 --> 3717.68
sphere I mean you can't argue with that

3714.68 --> 3717.68
right

3728.559 --> 3734.079
and no I'm not letting that one go I

3731.119 --> 3736.48
think it's hilarious that Alex Jones

3734.079 --> 3739.599
actually holds on to

3736.48 --> 3741.559
that that that's his goto when he gets

3739.599 --> 3744.1600000000003
triggered about Flat Earth I find it

3741.559 --> 3746.96
extremely

3744.16 --> 3749.799
hilarious like I find it endearing in a

3746.96 --> 3749.799
BAL arted

3760.72 --> 3768.0
way does Jupiter have a container uh no

3765.119 --> 3768.0
it's a nonlocal

3771.839 --> 3778.96
hologram it does not have anything does

3775.279 --> 3778.96
not have a physical

3782.559 --> 3788.279
existence it's merely a non-local

3785.119 --> 3788.279
holographic angular

3793.48 --> 3799.68
manifestation thought it was a gas giant

3795.92 --> 3799.6800000000003
yeah well that's what Helio centrists

3802.72 --> 3806.72
think right they have physicality

3804.96 --> 3808.559
assumption bias about it and then they

3806.72 --> 3810.64
start to think like oh so what is it

3808.559 --> 3814.7200000000003
then well it's it's a lot of gas that

3810.64 --> 3816.68
just sticks to it gas sitting in a ball

3814.72 --> 3820.8799999999997
right next to the vacuum of outer space

3816.68 --> 3820.8799999999997
like that makes even less sense than

3831.599 --> 3836.599
earth right so if it makes even less

3834.2 --> 3838.24
sense then of course that the option you

3836.599 --> 3841.2400000000002
have to go

3838.24 --> 3841.24
with

3845.76 --> 3852.4
right where the butterflies go when it

3849.52 --> 3856.839
rains I think they go and just

3852.4 --> 3856.839
sit on tree branches and

3857.279 --> 3863.839
such I think

3859.48 --> 3867.52
some butterflies may also

3863.839 --> 3869.72
like like hide under leaves and all that

3867.52 --> 3869.72
who

3890.64 --> 3897.1189999999997
knows gas ball in a vacuum yeah it is

3893.279 --> 3897.119
kind of silly isn't it

3899.559 --> 3903.1600000000003
and the silly thing about it is that if

3902.0 --> 3906.359
it is a

3903.16 --> 3909.16
gas then how would it ever have enough

3906.359 --> 3911.0789999999997
Mass to actually have the gas being

3909.16 --> 3913.5589999999997
gravitationally pulled towards the

3911.079 --> 3913.559
center of

3916.64 --> 3922.64
it it it like

3919.68 --> 3925.48
deepens the mechanical issues of

3922.64 --> 3928.359
heliocentric gravity even further so

3925.48 --> 3932.68
it's like it's really the worst possible

3928.359 --> 3932.68
setup to imagine

3969.44 --> 3975.839
and ice creams are two for bloody 9 lb

3973.599 --> 3977.6800000000003
yeah well you know the little girls just

3975.839 --> 3981.24
complaining about it but you could also

3977.68 --> 3984.24
see this like oh wow the pound's really

3981.24 --> 3988.3999999999996
worth [ __ ] isn't

3984.24 --> 3990.72
it you have to spend 9bs to get two ice

3988.4 --> 3992.48
creams right you could say oh the ice

3990.72 --> 3994.5589999999997
creams are so expensive or you could

3992.48 --> 3997.44
just say like wow the pound's really

3994.559 --> 3998.44
taking a nose dive hasn't it why could

3997.44 --> 4002.279
that

3998.44 --> 4005.4
be could it be because of cultural

4002.279 --> 4005.4
enrichment and

4008.039 --> 4013.559
dilution it's like yeah yeah the pound's

4010.52 --> 4019.48
worth [ __ ] now so you have to cough up

4013.559 --> 4019.48
more pounds to uh get the same products

4064.319 --> 4069.7599999999998
yep but I mean yeah that's what happens

4067.359 --> 4073.24
yeah you let a bunch of marxists

4069.76 --> 4076.5200000000004
scumbags into a government they create

4073.24 --> 4079.0389999999998
this insane open border policy and

4076.52 --> 4083.359
declare the local native people that

4079.039 --> 4087.2400000000002
have been there for over 100 years to be

4083.359 --> 4089.16
racist and try to exclude them from just

4087.24 --> 4091.0789999999997
getting good careers

4089.16 --> 4094.839
Etc

4091.079 --> 4097.279
right and then you will get inflation

4094.839 --> 4101.12
yeah that's exactly what happens because

4097.279 --> 4104.0
it literally just destroys the cohesive

4101.12 --> 4106.12
function of an entire country when you

4104.0 --> 4108.159
allow Marxist politics

4106.12 --> 4111.2789999999995
to do that together with mega

4108.159 --> 4113.679
corporations to your country yeah when

4111.279 --> 4116.4400000000005
when you allow marxists to destroy your

4113.679 --> 4119.08
country yeah your the value of your

4116.44 --> 4120.599999999999
money is going to go down yeah oh could

4119.08 --> 4124.679
have foreseen

4120.6 --> 4127.319
that how could you have known it's only

4124.679 --> 4130.64
like the number one in yourr face

4127.319 --> 4135.92
upfront concern that you have anytime

4130.64 --> 4135.92
that happens how could you have known

4147.199 --> 4153.12
yeah when you let your government people

4150.56 --> 4158.799
destroy the functions of your country

4153.12 --> 4162.44
and let tons of like non-nationals in

4158.799 --> 4166.64
and just like give them piles of

4162.44 --> 4168.879999999999
money and privileges yeah then the value

4166.64 --> 4171.52
the average value of the money goes down

4168.88 --> 4174.679
dramatically and everybody's

4171.52 --> 4176.56
screwed like including those newcomers

4174.679 --> 4179.759
like everybody's just screwed isn't that

4176.56 --> 4183.839000000001
just great it's the most efficient way

4179.759 --> 4183.839
to destroy a country because nobody

4184.88 --> 4191.799
wins yeah because that's what marxists

4187.279 --> 4194.159000000001
do they always try to create lose lose

4191.799 --> 4196.28
situations there's a winner then there's

4194.159 --> 4199.4
a jealous party but if there's no winner

4196.28 --> 4201.5199999999995
and everybody's screwed well then

4199.4 --> 4203.36
everybody's okay with that everybody

4201.52 --> 4204.84
will be able to get used to that

4203.36 --> 4206.839999999999
everybody's screwed there's not going to

4204.84 --> 4208.92
be one party that's going to be isolated

4206.84 --> 4211.8
nobody's going to be discriminated again

4208.92 --> 4215.56
against because everybody's

4211.8 --> 4215.56
screwed aren't they just

4217.159 --> 4224.0
lovely

4219.52 --> 4226.4400000000005

4733.52 --> 4737.52
going to Snuff it

4735.88 --> 4739.92
not because I'm going to do anything

4737.52 --> 4743.52

[Music]

scumbags I mean at this point these

4761.32 --> 4767.239
people are so bad there's literally not

4764.48 --> 4770.879999999999
any any historical

4767.239 --> 4773.12
figure that you could compare them to

4770.88 --> 4776.679
that would be

4773.12 --> 4779.84
worse this just no historical figure

4776.679 --> 4782.36
that's actually worse than these [ __ ]

4779.84 --> 4784.6
people with the level of manipulation

4782.36 --> 4787.199
that they de out it's so atrocious

4784.6 --> 4789.52
there's literally nobody in history you

4787.199 --> 4791.96
could compare them

4789.52 --> 4796.120000000001
to I mean there's people that have been

4791.96 --> 4798.679
like more brutal more torturous or or

4796.12 --> 4803.159
more overwhelmingly military or

4798.679 --> 4805.56
something right but nobody's

4803.159 --> 4810.759999999999
this

4805.56 --> 4810.76
delusional I mean Marie Antoinette is

4811.92 --> 4819.84
like is like a genius compared to like

4817.56 --> 4822.719
how she thought of the world and how she

4819.84 --> 4825.360000000001
managed things and was diplomatic and

4822.719 --> 4828.28
like that's a genius compared to like

4825.36 --> 4831.159
this leadership now that's part of these

4828.28 --> 4834.199
climate change cultist parties and WF

4831.159 --> 4834.199
agenda people

4835.12 --> 4843.08
like you just can't compare

4838.32 --> 4843.08
them they're so vile so

4843.28 --> 4849.599999999999
disgusting such upfront liar so

Shameless about it so fully committed to

4849.6 --> 4855.08
the LIE there's literally nobody in

4852.08 --> 4857.88
history you could compare that to nobody

4855.08 --> 4861.239
nobody is that terrible like anybody

4857.88 --> 4865.0
you'd mention that you like oh oh not

4861.239 --> 4867.718999999999
cig or something like just think of

4865.0 --> 4870.04
anybody to compare them to and then

4867.719 --> 4872.88
realize that that person historical

4870.04 --> 4876.36
figure that you're comparing them to is

4872.88 --> 4880.4400000000005

that we like to historically referen

4901.44 --> 4908.159
they'd all say dude if I was here I

4905.28 --> 4909.28
would literally have them executed in

4908.159 --> 4912.32
half an

4909.28 --> 4915.36
hour just throw like cut them up and

4912.32 --> 4917.5599999999995
throw them in a pit and bury them quick

4915.36 --> 4919.759999999999
like that's how those people that you

4917.56 --> 4923.8
would be able to compare them to would

4919.76 --> 4927.8
actually respond to these people like

4923.8 --> 4930.0
they're so disgusting and vile and

4927.8 --> 4932.4400000000005
insane and

to they're

4940.199 --> 4944.719
worse they're the worst

4945.76 --> 4951.76
they're so delusional you could never

4948.44 --> 4953.5599999999995
make them see how bad they really are

4951.76 --> 4956.12
they know how bad they are but they

4953.56 --> 4959.84
can't see they refuse to see

4956.12 --> 4963.08
it they're just being led by their

4959.84 --> 4965.6
horrendous and they will refuse to admit

4963.08 --> 4968.84
anything anything at

4965.6 --> 4972.0
all the only thing that they will submit

4968.84 --> 4974.52
to is anything that brings them power

4972.0 --> 4976.159
that's the only thing that they give any

4974.52 --> 4979.56
recognition to that's the only thing

4976.159 --> 4984.5199999999995
that that remains existent to

4979.56 --> 4986.120000000001
them power unadulterated

4984.52 --> 4989.84
Shameless

4986.12 --> 4989.84
Limitless ambitious

4990.239 --> 4993.718999999999
power any

4994.679 --> 4998.12
sacrifice any

5000.4 --> 5005.12
humility all dignity overboard

5003.08 --> 5007.679
everything it's just you can't compare

5005.12 --> 5013.04
it to anybody how terrible these people

5007.679 --> 5013.04
are that are now just doing these things

5036.96 --> 5042.36
what what the [ __ ] are you talking about

5039.44 --> 5045.04
Stephen Jarvis you think Earth is

5042.36 --> 5050.08
getting bigger due to inflation

5045.04 --> 5050.08
what that makes no damn sense

5067.239 --> 5070.36
hello woodworking gy

5087.96 --> 5096.32
bear you love lunabar could you just not

5091.32 --> 5096.32
do that here please

5097.44 --> 5101.28
I'm in the middle of a live show

5109.48 --> 5113.48
dude right

5127.08 --> 5131.679
have an election next month I have an

5129.199 --> 5131.678999999999
election

5131.719 --> 5135.4
tomorrow European

5136.92 --> 5141.52
Parliament that's that's tomorrow

5141.92 --> 5149.92
here and I will do my voting but I mean

5146.119 --> 5149.92
I have a strong suspicion that the

5150.239 --> 5158.08
last vote was just completely stolen

5155.199 --> 5161.96
so have a suspicion that that will

5158.08 --> 5165.199
be unfortunately repeated like I think

5161.96 --> 5169.52
that they just there's just

5165.199 --> 5172.28
brutal voter fraud like people are like

5169.52 --> 5176.4800000000005
completely onp purpose miscounting

5172.28 --> 5178.48
things and just erasing votes and just

5176.48 --> 5182.32
total

5178.48 --> 5182.32
fraud and it's super

5182.4 --> 5190.04
criminal and people that are like

5185.96 --> 5193.199
actually involved in like the

5190.04 --> 5195.44
fraud with these voting should get life

5193.199 --> 5195.44
in

5196.119 --> 5201.599999999999
prison and when I say life in prison I

5198.92 --> 5205.36
actually mean actual life in

5201.6 --> 5208.52
prison which would be like at least four

5205.36 --> 5211.0
times a life sentence like your entire

5208.52 --> 5214.0
life in jail like that's what you should

5211.0 --> 5214.0
get

5223.52 --> 5229.8
cuz 20 years is definitely not enough

5226.84 --> 5233.04
people that are that disgusting and

5229.8 --> 5235.1990000000005
Shameless they'll just keep doing it

5233.04 --> 5237.119
they will keep doing it and hey we're

5235.199 --> 5238.719
not allowed to execute people here in

5237.119 --> 5242.0
the Netherlands nobody can get the death

5238.719 --> 5243.119
penalty so then just okay well then four

5242.0 --> 5247.159
life

5243.119 --> 5247.159
sentences for

5297.96 --> 5303.88
did I like your Baris Johnson bro

5310.44 --> 5315.239
no now he's [ __ ] disgusting and evil

5313.679 --> 5318.639
and a

5315.239 --> 5322.119
traitor like predominantly

5318.639 --> 5322.119
treacherous in all

5329.36 --> 5337.28
directions did you know he's like

5331.36 --> 5337.28
married to some [ __ ] psycho Satan n

5388.159 --> 5392.638999999999
where the light that's interesting fibos

5390.719 --> 5395.84
I get that feeling too like there's

5392.639 --> 5398.6
something unnatural about that

5395.84 --> 5400.96
name like it's an assembled name that

5398.6 --> 5403.639
has historical occult meaning or

5400.96 --> 5405.84
something could be I mean I wouldn't be

5403.639 --> 5408.1990000000005
surprised it's weird that you picked up

5405.84 --> 5411.04
on that

5408.199 --> 5417.0
feeling and it is a feeling until you

5411.04 --> 5417.0
can actually like make an argued case

5426.679 --> 5431.1990000000005
BJ that's hilarious woodwork gy

5438.88 --> 5443.4800000000005
Bear yeah don't forget to rogin it up

5441.44 --> 5447.36
and share the

5443.48 --> 5447.36
show Johnson's the

5447.4 --> 5451.839999999999
Dork yeah that too

5466.52 --> 5472.0
all right I'm going to get my second

5468.159 --> 5472.0
coffee here I'll be right

5482.92 --> 5485.92
back

5512.84 --> 5516.88
e e

5565.44 --> 5568.44
h

5601.6 --> 5605.6
I don't know fibr outs

5606.239 --> 5609.879999999999
15 minutes every four

5611.679 --> 5617.36
hours well it depends on what kind of

5614.199 --> 5617.36
work that is fi

5617.84 --> 5622.0
roads I mean if it's kind of

5623.28 --> 5630.44
boring like easy to do then yeah 15

5627.6 --> 5633.8
minutes every 4 hours pretty

5630.44 --> 5636.5199999999995
standard maybe half an hour they do it

5633.8 --> 5636.52
for every 4

5636.719 --> 5643.36
hours but if it's like more intense then

5640.44 --> 5645.4
yeah those then it will probably be like

5643.36 --> 5648.719
50 minutes every two

5645.4 --> 5650.759999999999
hours I don't know I I have no idea

5648.719 --> 5654.639
about that fir roads I don't know about

5650.76 --> 5656.56
the details about labor law I have very

5654.639 --> 5659.4800000000005
very little to do with

5656.56 --> 5663.719
it last time that was really relevant to

5659.48 --> 5663.718999999999
me is like 20 years ago

5674.52 --> 5678.119000000001
like I don't know

5719.639 --> 5723.76
yeah woodwork going to I think that

5721.639 --> 5726.76
borders boy might have a point there

5723.76 --> 5729.96
like he might be one of like those

5726.76 --> 5731.84
trotskyites from America or something

5729.96 --> 5734.84
some or

5731.84 --> 5734.84
another

5737.8 --> 5742.76
group whatever he is he's up he's no

5743.92 --> 5749.639
good and he's like allegedly married to

5747.36 --> 5753.639
some freaking Satanist

5749.639 --> 5753.639
[ __ ] so

5783.239 --> 5788.48
all right so borders boy basically

5785.239 --> 5794.04
arguing that he is like a a

5788.48 --> 5794.04
Kazarian which he might very well be

5816.4 --> 5820.0
uh

5817.48 --> 5824.4
oh shouldn't have mentioned the word

5820.0 --> 5828.56
gazarian oh no this dream is still

5824.4 --> 5828.5599999999995
there started

5835.639 --> 5842.6
stalling Caucasian no that's not the

5839.239 --> 5842.599999999999
same thing

5873.28 --> 5876.719
ah

5874.56 --> 5879.96
whatever I don't know why you guys are

5876.719 --> 5879.96
so interested in him

5882.159 --> 5888.4
anyway I mean just don't listen to him

5885.48 --> 5888.4
don't vote for

5888.719 --> 5895.0
him and don't let him and his wife

5891.639 --> 5900.2390000000005
babysit your kids I

5895.0 --> 5900.239
mean that's that's about it

5931.52 --> 5936.56
what do you mean an IV

5934.04 --> 5941.8
f

5936.56 --> 5941.8
with is that supposedly a joke

5973.66 --> 5979.5199999999995
[Music]

5975.159 --> 5979.5199999999995
right anyway I'll just go scrolling

5979.96 --> 5985.199
around see what's happening out there

5996.44 --> 6002.4
right if you guys noticed that there's

5998.679 --> 6002.4
like a barrage

6002.52 --> 6012.280000000001
happening against like foui had a whole

6007.92 --> 6015.4400000000005
issue recently like he's getting

6012.28 --> 6018.84
hammered by

6015.44 --> 6020.879999999999
like within the US government so all

6018.84 --> 6024.08
these hearings and [ __ ] and he's like

6020.88 --> 6026.159000000001
really getting hammered I mean

6024.08 --> 6029.239
he's screwed up big time and he's like

6026.159 --> 6031.08
it's getting to him apparently now CL

6029.239 --> 6034.119
Schwab is going

6031.08 --> 6039.08
to also get a

6034.119 --> 6039.08
treatment he stepped down recently

6057.84 --> 6063.719
okay well

6060.56 --> 6066.84
okay but if you say so seeking sty water

6063.719 --> 6070.32
like I didn't get it so maybe my humor

6066.84 --> 6070.32
is just terrible or

6082.239 --> 6086.28
something for

6142.159 --> 6146.159
that e

6179.159 --> 6184.32
yeah clutch I okay if you're talking

6182.119 --> 6186.759999999999
about that yeah it it is going on it's

6184.32 --> 6188.96
just like getting in the news and then

6186.76 --> 6193.4800000000005
being treated on Alex Jones and the news

6188.96 --> 6193.4800000000005
article so it's all over the place

6215.719 --> 6222.199
yeah so fire you could say like a frosty

6218.56 --> 6222.1990000000005
wind is blowing through

6227.04 --> 6234.5199999999995
the through yeah among these Eugenics

6232.32 --> 6238.32
tyrants these people that thought that

6234.52 --> 6238.320000000001
they were going to take it over the

6238.8 --> 6242.4400000000005
transhumanist medical

6255.639 --> 6261.599
dictators so yeah that is actually kind

6258.44 --> 6261.598999999999
of hopeful I've been

6261.639 --> 6269.32
very SK IAL about something actually

6265.719 --> 6272.96
happening but it does seem like it is

6269.32 --> 6275.759999999999
just the millstone is finally actually

6272.96 --> 6279.96
starting to roll starting to crush some

6275.76 --> 6279.96
bones it's about goddamn

6287.08 --> 6292.599
time it's got a long road to go

6293.15 --> 6296.299999999999
[Music]

6313.719 --> 6318.719
right and I'm kind of nervous again

6315.639 --> 6321.1990000000005
about the supposed European

6318.719 --> 6324.96
elections tomorrow I just got this

6321.199 --> 6324.96
feeling like they're going to massively

6341.56 --> 6346.719
riged and by the way it's it's also I'm

6344.679 --> 6350.599
starting to take notice that the climate

6346.719 --> 6353.04
cist here like they know they're losing

6350.599 --> 6356.96
and they're at this phase just

6353.04 --> 6359.84
desperately trying to keep the cult

6356.96 --> 6361.88
together trying to keep the power keep

6359.84 --> 6366.04
people in the mindset of fear and oh

6361.88 --> 6366.04
it's all necessary it's real

6367.199 --> 6371.678999999999
desperation cuz most people aren't

6369.52 --> 6373.599
falling for it it's those that are just

6371.679 --> 6375.639
like completely surrendered all their

6373.599 --> 6378.76
sensories because they couldn't handle

6375.639 --> 6384.56
anything that are that will just do what

6378.76 --> 6384.56
they say but that's not a majority

6385.159 --> 6391.32
cuz even those numpties caught on that

6388.119 --> 6394.32
yeah the these politicians are real

6391.32 --> 6396.639
serious liars and like war

6394.32 --> 6400.28
criminals they're

6396.639 --> 6400.28
effectively like war

6403.52 --> 6409.52
criminals like even the zombies can can

6406.88 --> 6413.4800000000005
start feeling it they they they start to

6409.52 --> 6413.4800000000005
feel that so

6414.85 --> 6419.119000000001
[Music]

6416.639 --> 6421.599
now now my question is are they going to

6419.119 --> 6423.598999999999
steal it are they just going to like oh

6421.599 --> 6425.88
oh look at all this form for democracy

6423.599 --> 6429.84
voters oh okay we'll

6425.88 --> 6433.639
just well we we can't let them have it

6429.84 --> 6436.400000000001
so we'll just put it on Gert wild

6433.639 --> 6438.599
Wilder's party right I I feel like

6436.4 --> 6441.119
that's what they did last time that they

6438.599 --> 6443.639
just swapped the votes they just took

6441.119 --> 6444.96
all the form for democracy and just

6443.639 --> 6447.8
threw him

6444.96 --> 6451.28
on on

6447.8 --> 6454.08
PVP on G

6451.28 --> 6457.239
Wilders who is a controlled opposition

6454.08 --> 6459.679
it's like oh no the the opposition like

6457.239 --> 6461.638999999999
oh everybody voted for the oppos no I

6459.679 --> 6464.4400000000005
did not [ __ ] vote for

6461.639 --> 6467.719
him yeah I never

6464.44 --> 6471.08
will and he's a [ __ ] St he's like our

6467.719 --> 6473.36
Dutch Boris Johnson he really

6471.08 --> 6477.48
is he's a seller

6473.36 --> 6480.32
out total agenda

6477.48 --> 6482.48
sellout like he has some like local

6480.32 --> 6484.5199999999995
points that he's like holding on to but

6482.48 --> 6487.32
on the big stage he is a

6484.52 --> 6490.320000000001
complete New World Order

6487.32 --> 6490.32
sellout

6491.239 --> 6495.44
terrible can't be trusted at

6497.84 --> 6506.76
all so I feel like yeah they might do

6502.08 --> 6506.76
the just something like that again

6538.04 --> 6541.0
yeah you got a good point there

6539.199 --> 6543.36
woodworking guny bear I mean yeah you

6541.0 --> 6546.84
could think of those head figures as

6543.36 --> 6549.44
operatives and that they're

6546.84 --> 6551.92
Expendables Expendable

6549.44 --> 6554.159
assets and then when things get too hot

6551.92 --> 6555.84
and too much dissatisfaction they

6554.159 --> 6559.5599999999995
basically burn them

6555.84 --> 6563.639
up as a sacrifice so that people have

6559.56 --> 6566.0
some fact simile of Justice while they

6563.639 --> 6569.2390000000005
carry on their power

6566.0 --> 6571.719
structure yeah that's definitely part of

6569.239 --> 6571.718999999999
how they

6571.84 --> 6577.96
operate but I mean it's not working

6575.48 --> 6581.199
anymore though like people are not

6577.96 --> 6584.119
satisfied over a a bunch of individuals

6581.199 --> 6586.5199999999995
getting caught up like it's like no no

6584.119 --> 6590.04
yeah we know that oh look at it's all

6586.52 --> 6592.84
his no no we know it's all of you we

6590.04 --> 6595.76
know it's you we know you're a Marxist

6592.84 --> 6599.2390000000005
[ __ ] criminals you're traitors to

6595.76 --> 6601.1990000000005
your nation you're sabotaging the whole

6599.239 --> 6603.08
place you're

6601.199 --> 6604.839999999999
imposing

6603.08 --> 6607.119
unscientific

6604.84 --> 6609.96
cultish

6607.119 --> 6612.36
beliefs that are antihuman on everybody

6609.96 --> 6614.639
and everybody knows it we know it we

6612.36 --> 6617.04
know it's all of you it's not that one

6614.639 --> 6619.119
individual that you're will also willing

6617.04 --> 6620.92
to sacrifice because they just went too

6619.119 --> 6622.96
far yeah go [ __ ] yourself we know it's

6620.92 --> 6626.8
all of you

6622.96 --> 6626.8
know it's not working

6632.0 --> 6638.28
anymore yeah you're a you're a big club

6635.04 --> 6641.8
and we're not in it and this club has

6638.28 --> 6641.8
got to end

6655.28 --> 6661.199
and all the participants should be

6658.079 --> 6664.119
arrested and just tried for their

6661.199 --> 6667.32
involvement in this criminal conspiracy

6664.119 --> 6670.159
which is literally what it is in many

6667.32 --> 6672.92
directions it is Criminal it has they

6670.159 --> 6676.119
have violated

6672.92 --> 6679.4800000000005
laws they have committed

6676.119 --> 6681.598999999999
fraud in many many ways it's like on

6679.48 --> 6683.678999999999
record and now they need to be held

6681.599 --> 6686.159000000001
accountable for it

6683.679 --> 6688.76
and that's just on a national level man

6686.159 --> 6691.119
like if you just put it all together

6688.76 --> 6695.56
like all the international crimes and

6691.119 --> 6695.5599999999995
all like it's too

6696.8 --> 6704.0
much it's just too much to trace it all

6700.8 --> 6706.2390000000005
back right technically it's enough to

6704.0 --> 6708.0
have like a million people or something

6706.239 --> 6710.839999999999
that are part of this all over Europe

6708.0 --> 6713.119
and the world to have them executed very

6710.84 --> 6715.119000000001
quickly like there is way

6713.119 --> 6717.5599999999995
it's just that if you really want to

6715.119 --> 6720.119
highlight every damn thing it's probably

6717.56 --> 6723.599
going to take like 80

6720.119 --> 6726.159
years just to get through all of it okay

6723.599 --> 6730.28
it's that [ __ ] insanely elaborate

6726.159 --> 6733.48
it's so much crime so bad so far so

6730.28 --> 6738.079
spread out so many involvements

6733.48 --> 6738.079
it's it's just undoable

6748.199 --> 6753.199
unless you like on purpose having that

6750.679 --> 6757.28
in mind speed it up and just like okay

6753.199 --> 6757.28
let's just get to the end as quick as

6759.56 --> 6766.34
possible but yeah I mean yeah we'll see

6763.719 --> 6767.719
what happens but

6766.34 --> 6771.719
[Music]

6767.719 --> 6775.04
first they throw the sacrifices they

6771.719 --> 6778.76
cast off their sacrificial

6775.04 --> 6782.28
people that are supposed to satisfy us

6778.76 --> 6784.52
supposed to satisfy the general Public's

6782.28 --> 6787.119
hunger for

6784.52 --> 6790.719
justice yeah but guess what it's not

6787.119 --> 6794.079
[ __ ] going to work because yeah we

6790.719 --> 6796.52
don't need your little water droplet on

6794.079 --> 6800.199
the Red Hot Plate yeah yeah it's not

6796.52 --> 6802.92
working it's not sufficing it's not

6800.199 --> 6805.119
going to suffice

6802.92 --> 6807.679
like it wouldn't suffice even if you

6805.119 --> 6811.4
literally had these individuals burned

6807.679 --> 6812.76
at the stake literally like even then it

6811.4 --> 6815.759999999999
would not

6812.76 --> 6815.76
suffice

6816.48 --> 6823.199
like you went too

6819.159 --> 6828.839999999999
far no sacrifice from your side is going

6823.199 --> 6828.839999999999
to suffice only the whole thing

6845.679 --> 6850.28
yeah they are failing indeed yeah

6847.159 --> 6853.159
they're losing their mind control Power

6850.28 --> 6853.159
would work in guny

6853.599 --> 6858.639
Bear they can't use their consensus

6856.52 --> 6859.599
power they can't use their peer pressure

6858.639 --> 6862.04
system

6859.599 --> 6865.079
anymore because they're faltering and

6862.04 --> 6867.36
even the people that would willingly sit

6865.079 --> 6869.599
under their control are becoming aware

6867.36 --> 6873.28
of their lies and their

6869.599 --> 6875.719
crimes and so people might want to go

6873.28 --> 6878.639
with the biggest power that's just like

6875.719 --> 6881.32
oh we're just in control but they don't

6878.639 --> 6884.0
want to associate with the horrendous

6881.32 --> 6887.48
crimes that are becoming more

6884.0 --> 6889.52
visible yeah people so it's the

6887.48 --> 6893.678999999999
autopilot of like oh switch to the

6889.52 --> 6897.52
winning team like that effect is dying

6893.679 --> 6900.0
down they're losing their consensus

6897.52 --> 6904.360000000001
Powers they're losing their power and

6900.0 --> 6905.679
that is like the key power the key power

6904.36 --> 6909.759999999999
of marxist

6905.679 --> 6912.0
communism and it's waning it's it's

6909.76 --> 6914.280000000001
crumbling that means that even those

6912.0 --> 6915.48
that are very vulnerable to consensus

6914.28 --> 6918.5599999999995
power will

6915.48 --> 6924.0
eventually rather be lonely

6918.56 --> 6924.0
Rebels than become part of that

6927.44 --> 6931.32
yeah so in that

6933.599 --> 6939.96
sense like on a spiritual level you

6936.8 --> 6942.52
could say the energies are the darkness

6939.96 --> 6945.4
is losing and energy wise it's just

6942.52 --> 6947.96
they're still too rooted in actual

6945.4 --> 6947.96
physical

6948.92 --> 6953.599
power they're still capable of

6951.32 --> 6955.799999999999
destroying so much

6953.599 --> 6958.04
so yeah we might be having spiritual

6955.8 --> 6962.04
victories in that but they can still do

6958.04 --> 6963.88
so much Dage like everybody's

6962.04 --> 6966.56
underestimated that

6963.88 --> 6969.56
part I mean this is on everybody this is

6966.56 --> 6973.320000000001
on everybody for just letting it

6969.56 --> 6975.76
happen and for having a world and a

6973.32 --> 6981.0
government system and a

6975.76 --> 6984.2390000000005
society where such things can be let

6981.0 --> 6984.239
happen yeah

6984.4 --> 6989.839999999999
that's the problem the problem is is

6986.04 --> 6991.679
that we live in a world where people can

6989.84 --> 6995.04
just let that

6991.679 --> 6997.8
happen that that is a physical

6995.04 --> 7002.159
possibility that is the problem because

6997.8 --> 7002.159000000001
you can't blame everybody for letting it

7002.56 --> 7008.52
happen people expect that that shouldn't

7005.36 --> 7012.48
be possible but it was possible and that

7008.52 --> 7014.8
is the problem problem is that Marxism

7012.48 --> 7014.799999999999
is

7018.119 --> 7024.719
legal that there's

7021.28 --> 7029.199
no yeah that just these people can say

7024.719 --> 7034.52
these things and be legally allow to do

7029.199 --> 7034.5199999999995
that that is the [ __ ] problem

7050.599 --> 7054.8
yeah and I'm talking about people in

7052.4 --> 7058.159
power people in power should not be

7054.8 --> 7060.88
allowed to be Marxist ever I mean some

7058.159 --> 7063.799999999999
weirdo out

7060.88 --> 7065.52
there could be like all Marxist and they

7063.8 --> 7067.88
could be even transhumanist dude they

7065.52 --> 7069.4800000000005
could whatever but if you're in power

7067.88 --> 7071.2390000000005
and if you're actually going to do

7069.48 --> 7073.5199999999995
something and going to be capable of

7071.239 --> 7076.678999999999
doing something

7073.52 --> 7076.679
yeah that's what power

7077.92 --> 7085.84
means you should not be Marxist you

7082.44 --> 7088.4
should not be allowed to be in power if

7085.84 --> 7092.119000000001
you have any Marxist influences or

7088.4 --> 7096.32
background or actions or

7092.119 --> 7096.32
connections should not be

7100.92 --> 7107.639
allowed and not be allowed because there

7104.28 --> 7111.719
are people to point it out and then say

7107.639 --> 7115.8
uh nope veto no no just even if there

7111.719 --> 7118.599
were no people it should not be allowed

7115.8 --> 7121.1990000000005
it shouldn't have to be [ __ ] pointed

7118.599 --> 7123.28
out by sane

7121.199 --> 7127.28
individuals that it's not allowed it

7123.28 --> 7130.599
should per default be

7127.28 --> 7133.04
impossible impossible it should per

7130.599 --> 7137.639
default be impossible

7133.04 --> 7137.639
possible should be automated

7137.719 --> 7140.719
systems

7141.48 --> 7147.5199999999995
like military

7143.679 --> 7149.8
arguably like oh a Marxist starts to

7147.52 --> 7151.76
like campaign and do this [ __ ] and then

7149.8 --> 7153.96
just like roll out these policies well

7151.76 --> 7157.719
then it's time for the military to come

7153.96 --> 7161.04
in and like you're under arrest for

7157.719 --> 7165.04
treason you're committing Marxist

7161.04 --> 7167.5199999999995
policies you're you're blatantly

7165.04 --> 7169.159
breaking election promises and doing

7167.52 --> 7172.4400000000005
exactly the opposite which is what

7169.159 --> 7175.5199999999995
marxists do that's illegal you're under

7172.44 --> 7179.678999999999
arrest you [ __ ] Marxist

7175.52 --> 7182.639
politician yeah that should be the

7179.679 --> 7185.4
default not something that a bunch of

7182.639 --> 7188.599
sane people would have to come together

7185.4 --> 7192.239
and agree to and then something happens

7188.599 --> 7195.2390000000005
it should be the default immediately

7192.239 --> 7195.239
automatically

7214.48 --> 7220.718999999999
happening yeah so yeah there's some

7217.639 --> 7223.96
pointers for any future European

7220.719 --> 7223.96
government system

7224.639 --> 7228.84
if there's going to be any future left

7227.0 --> 7232.48
they're not just going to like just blow

7228.84 --> 7232.4800000000005
up a whole bunch of

7241.32 --> 7246.36
places I mean at this point I like I

7244.04 --> 7250.32
fear the worst for Poland like they're

7246.36 --> 7250.32
so screwed man

7254.679 --> 7258.88
yeah and I mean Ukraine like whatever's

7257.56 --> 7261.2390000000005
left of

7258.88 --> 7264.52
that I mean everybody knows about that

7261.239 --> 7269.638999999999
but like Poland seems to be like really

7264.52 --> 7271.8
totally wef president complete sjw

7269.639 --> 7275.159000000001
psycho

7271.8 --> 7278.96
and yeah he could be like literally just

7275.159 --> 7283.5199999999995
suicide piling on to the war and

7278.96 --> 7283.52
like this is bad

7283.8 --> 7288.1990000000005
and I don't think like oh nuclear war

7286.079 --> 7290.599
everything's going to blow up hydrogen

7288.199 --> 7292.079
bombs are going to just leave giant

7290.599 --> 7296.56
craters where before there was a

7292.079 --> 7299.32
European continent no no don't worry

7296.56 --> 7302.280000000001
about that but I think that a lot of

7299.32 --> 7304.48
places could just blow up though mainly

7302.28 --> 7304.48
like

7305.679 --> 7310.679
bases military training grounds

7311.96 --> 7317.199
power plants kind of thing like it would

7314.88 --> 7319.32
be bad I mean if that kind of thing

7317.199 --> 7322.48
happens like yeah the

7319.32 --> 7326.48
functionality will be screwed like there

7322.48 --> 7330.28
will be poverty and [ __ ] and like power

7326.48 --> 7330.28
loss and economic

7330.719 --> 7337.96
turmoil logistical breakdowns like it

7334.4 --> 7340.799999999999
will be very bad for all of Europe and

7337.96 --> 7343.119
America and Russia it will all Russia

7340.8 --> 7344.28
will probably be living through that

7343.119 --> 7347.04
very

7344.28 --> 7349.32
eloquently compared to the rest cuz they

7347.04 --> 7351.76
actually give a freaking hell they give

7349.32 --> 7355.44
a [ __ ] about their Nation for real they

7351.76 --> 7359.04
really do they really plan it

7355.44 --> 7359.04
out backup

7360.96 --> 7366.119
procedures yeah there's no nukes going

7363.32 --> 7368.48
to blow everything apart and just leave

7366.119 --> 7373.5199999999995
a bunch of craters but I

7368.48 --> 7377.718999999999
mean like yeah they can just blow up

7373.52 --> 7377.719
they can technically blow up entire

7380.04 --> 7387.119
cities there's no point in doing

7385.04 --> 7389.719
that right I

7387.119 --> 7392.0
mean you want to do damage why the hell

7389.719 --> 7395.44
blow up an entire city it would just

7392.0 --> 7397.8
look really really bad for you as a

7395.44 --> 7400.32
nation to have done that when you could

7397.8 --> 7402.679
just tear down the electricity cut the

7400.32 --> 7404.759999999999
logistics off and then

7402.679 --> 7406.88
the the people in the city will just end

7404.76 --> 7409.1990000000005
up eating each other and then just half

7406.88 --> 7412.599
of them dying and

7409.199 --> 7415.199
it and nobody would even make the direct

7412.599 --> 7417.52
connection like oh that's you you blew

7415.199 --> 7419.598999999999
them up no because they didn't blow them

7417.52 --> 7422.320000000001
up they just cut off certain things and

7419.599 --> 7422.32
then it ate

7422.96 --> 7426.96
itself yeah

7432.679 --> 7437.36
so yeah that [ __ ] could be there could

7434.76 --> 7441.04
be something happening like

7437.36 --> 7445.119
that but I think that the first in the

7441.04 --> 7447.5199999999995
first period it would just be like just

7445.119 --> 7451.799999999999
Poland getting completely

7447.52 --> 7451.8
[ __ ] because of this freak in

7453.96 --> 7459.4800000000005
power right but I mean it could be also

7456.639 --> 7462.119
just that it all depends on like how

7459.48 --> 7464.44
that will unroll I mean Putin could

7462.119 --> 7466.28
bling Putin the generals of Russia could

7464.44 --> 7469.04
just like okay we're just going to blow

7466.28 --> 7471.759999999999
up their their government building and

7469.04 --> 7474.199
just like boom and just leave it to that

7471.76 --> 7476.96
probably the people of Poland will be

7474.199 --> 7479.839999999999
like very glad to like yeah we did not

7476.96 --> 7483.079
want this [ __ ] yeah we don't want to be

7479.84 --> 7485.28
the [ __ ] sacrifice for this

7483.079 --> 7488.44
NATO

7485.28 --> 7492.639
Psychopathic plan

7488.44 --> 7495.44
like so who knows but but [ __ ] is going

7492.639 --> 7498.84
to go down I'm pretty sure that it

7495.44 --> 7502.159
will and as my original prediction

7498.84 --> 7505.719
stands Russia is going to win I mean

7502.159 --> 7508.119
it the still stands it's going to win

7505.719 --> 7510.599
like really really no matter

7508.119 --> 7513.159
what like even if America starts

7510.599 --> 7515.079
throwing all its Hightech Weaponry like

7513.159 --> 7521.199
it's going to

7515.079 --> 7521.199
win it really really will

7521.92 --> 7528.119
so the more you throw at it the more you

7524.44 --> 7528.119
guarantee the end of

7532.159 --> 7537.079
you and that's why the marxists are

7537.52 --> 7542.8
basically throwing everyone and

7540.159 --> 7544.839999999999
everything against Russia because they

7542.8 --> 7548.320000000001
know they will lose it's it's part of

7544.84 --> 7550.4400000000005
their demolishment policy like that's

7548.32 --> 7552.5199999999995
why all our money is being sent to

7550.44 --> 7554.759999999999
Ukraine that's why they're like

7552.52 --> 7557.52
suggesting like oh we need to send our

7554.76 --> 7560.079000000001
military there and send all our Weaponry

7557.52 --> 7561.96
there cuz that's the sacrifice it's not

7560.079 --> 7567.0
because they can win it's because they

7561.96 --> 7570.88
can destroy you it's what marxists

7567.0 --> 7574.199
do yeah do anything without any chance

7570.88 --> 7576.96
of success because it will destroy you

7574.199 --> 7576.96
it's what they

7578.32 --> 7586.44
do yeah marxists don't have

7582.84 --> 7591.4400000000005
plans to achieve things to achieve

7586.44 --> 7595.48
Victory they have plans to destroy

7591.44 --> 7595.48
you by any means

7602.0 --> 7608.28
necessary but a favorite trick of theirs

7604.88 --> 7611.599
is financial depletion just give away

7608.28 --> 7611.599
all the money

7612.239 --> 7619.598999999999
Financial depletion and of course a real

7615.36 --> 7621.5199999999995
a newcomer favorite is of course medical

7619.599 --> 7623.52
experimentation which we're all so

7621.52 --> 7626.280000000001
familiar with right because there's so

7623.52 --> 7630.96
much profits they can make from it have

7626.28 --> 7633.239
all this lovely exemption like oh yes oh

7630.96 --> 7635.599
there were some side effects there's a

7633.239 --> 7637.48
lot of people dying

7635.599 --> 7639.96
suddenly

7637.48 --> 7642.44
mysteriously but don't worry we're

7639.96 --> 7645.04
completely exempt

7642.44 --> 7647.079
we're completely yeah we had a special

7645.04 --> 7649.639
deal with the government like yeah well

7647.079 --> 7652.199
whatever happens with these

7649.639 --> 7654.4800000000005
experimentations we can't get sued over

7652.199 --> 7657.48
that and then the government agreed and

7654.48 --> 7659.799999999999
then the people

7657.48 --> 7662.199
agreed

7659.8 --> 7666.04
yay and that's also the reason why they

7662.199 --> 7667.96
haven't been forced right because one is

7666.04 --> 7671.559
not compatible with the other if they

7667.96 --> 7673.84
would have forced the experiment

7671.559 --> 7677.96
then they couldn't be

7673.84 --> 7679.04
exempt see it's because they couldn't

7677.96 --> 7681.719
Force

7679.04 --> 7684.48
you that they were except so they could

7681.719 --> 7687.719
only trick you into thinking that you

7684.48 --> 7691.199
had to do it or seduce you to do it and

7687.719 --> 7694.119
that way they could stay legally exempt

7691.199 --> 7698.598999999999
from the results if it would have been

7694.119 --> 7701.799999999999
forced then they could not have stayed

7698.599 --> 7705.04
exempt because it's forced

7701.8 --> 7706.88
see how that works it really does work

7705.04 --> 7711.679
like

7706.88 --> 7715.36
that it's very real like and it explains

7711.679 --> 7718.36
why why it's happening that

7715.36 --> 7718.36
way

7718.559 --> 7723.360000000001
right it's because they wanted to be

7721.0 --> 7725.48
able to get away with it it's not

7723.36 --> 7728.639
because they don't want to have

7725.48 --> 7730.44
everybody undergo the experiment is

7728.639 --> 7733.119
because they wanted to be able to

7730.44 --> 7734.879999999999
legally get away with it and that was

7733.119 --> 7739.32
the

7734.88 --> 7739.32
condition to be able to get away with

7739.44 --> 7746.4
it to literally have nobody be forced

7743.84 --> 7749.119000000001
like it has to then all be voluntary and

7746.4 --> 7751.119
that way they can stay exempt like

7749.119 --> 7752.598999999999
that's the deal with the devil that was

7751.119 --> 7755.0
made

7752.599 --> 7759.92
basically between them between that

7755.0 --> 7759.92
government and between those companies

7761.84 --> 7769.28
so now you understand

7764.679 --> 7770.8
why does it make more sense why now why

7769.28 --> 7773.48
how it

7770.8 --> 7775.88
happened yeah if it would have been

7773.48 --> 7779.04
forced they wouldn't have been able to

7775.88 --> 7781.92
exempt themselves from the

7779.04 --> 7785.92
consequences but because it hasn't been

7781.92 --> 7785.92
forced they can

7795.239 --> 7801.0
ah yeah woodwork gy bear unfortunately

7798.199 --> 7802.5199999999995
it is it's people are very shortsighted

7801.0 --> 7805.04
and easily

7802.52 --> 7807.040000000001
seduced to

7805.04 --> 7810.32
risk

7807.04 --> 7814.0
Monumental things in their entire future

7810.32 --> 7816.079
for some stupid nonsensical shortterm

7814.0 --> 7819.8
bit of

7816.079 --> 7823.32
Glory yeah people are easily seduced

7819.8 --> 7823.320000000001
into unbelievable

7834.96 --> 7841.96
ad all right so yeah I hope that my

7839.119 --> 7844.28
speech here makes some sense with some

7841.96 --> 7847.0
people

7844.28 --> 7851.96
here not getting a lot of direct

7847.0 --> 7854.96
responses to what I'm saying but

7851.96 --> 7854.96
h

7886.8 --> 7893.84
okay fish

7889.4 --> 7893.839999999999
fingers where are you

7947.76 --> 7950.4400000000005
uh yeah

7964.0 --> 7967.0
whatever

7969.239 --> 7975.638999999999
yeah so yeah maybe I should put

7971.559 --> 7975.639
something about that in the title

7982.08 --> 7988.249
[Music]

7985.17 --> 7988.249
[Applause]

7991.46 --> 7998.879
[Applause]

8011.84 --> 8016.639
uh what do you call that again um

8025.7 --> 8028.88
[Applause]

8039.76 --> 8044.88
how do I put this in the title it's not

8042.4 --> 8049.36
helping that nobody [ __ ] talks about

8044.88 --> 8049.36
what I'm talking about though but

8077.07 --> 8083.549999999999
[Applause]

8090.04 --> 8094.0
e for

8140.159 --> 8145.92
okay well this is fit temporarily at

8143.32 --> 8145.92
least

8149.92 --> 8153.96
something for

8173.29 --> 8176.42
[Music]

8232.439 --> 8237.319
yeah I I couldn't possibly fit all of

8235.28 --> 8239.28
this in the title so I'm just going to

8237.319 --> 8242.399
leave it the way this

8239.28 --> 8244.800000000001
is get all yeah that barely fits as it

8242.399 --> 8244.8
is

8246.88 --> 8251.399
so hey you getting wisdom

8273.92 --> 8279.28
H nice woodworking goty bear

8359.719 --> 8363.678999999998
for for

8401.439 --> 8408.399
H okay sorry getting distracted here by

8404.359 --> 8408.399000000001
a weird article

8427.319 --> 8431.68
I mean it is so I kind of want to talk

8429.359 --> 8434.640000000001
about it's it just feels

8431.68 --> 8436.319
silly and

8434.64 --> 8440.24
complex

8436.319 --> 8441.72
so NASA scientist oh this is a great

8440.24 --> 8445.52
start

8441.72 --> 8450.92
right NASA scientist

8445.52 --> 8454.399000000001
reveal all of the recent global warming

8450.92 --> 8457.359
readings have been caused by Green

8454.399 --> 8460.08
policies oh who could have foreseen

8457.359 --> 8462.800000000001
that but I mean it's like oh yeah well

8460.08 --> 8467.12
because NASA says it it must be [ __ ]

8462.8 --> 8472.479
real it's a ball it's a ball we're in

8467.12 --> 8475.92
the space they're so reliable they're so

8472.479 --> 8478.399
[ __ ] reliable they have to be used as

8475.92 --> 8481.76
the main reason why things have to

8478.399 --> 8486.08
change around because it's a b

8481.76 --> 8489.359
it's the allall the NASA is Our Saviors

8486.08 --> 8491.399
they have to tell us the freaking in

8489.359 --> 8493.28
Plains side logical thing that

8491.399 --> 8496.0
everybody's been figuring out in the

8493.28 --> 8500.800000000001
last 20 years they're the

8496.0 --> 8504.08
ones that are so on point are so

8500.8 --> 8507.24
reliable it's NASA thank you so much for

8504.08 --> 8507.24
telling us this

8507.479 --> 8515.24
thing but yeah I mean

8511.84 --> 8518.319
I wouldn't even need them to tell me

8515.24 --> 8521.08
this that yeah oh no [ __ ] like all these

8518.319 --> 8523.119999999999
green policies is literally changing the

8521.08 --> 8525.6
climate and not for the

8523.12 --> 8529.52
better however they argue this is

8525.6 --> 8529.52
supposed to work it's like completely

8534.88 --> 8541.16
irrelevant but I can already tell you

8537.319 --> 8546.84
like the cutting down of CO2 emissions

8541.16 --> 8550.92
is a bad influence on the weather and

8546.84 --> 8553.439
nature like I don't need to have any

8550.92 --> 8555.72
readings like oh we going to measure how

8553.439 --> 8558.08
much of this and that like I don't even

8555.72 --> 8560.84
need that to know that it's going to

8558.08 --> 8562.56
have a negative influence on the

8560.84 --> 8566.6
environment

8562.56 --> 8570.84
cuz plant life needs

8566.6 --> 8574.28
CO2 and that's a fact

8570.84 --> 8577.359
like that's all you even need to

8574.28 --> 8580.880000000001
know what more do you need to know

8577.359 --> 8584.52
nothing that's all you would need to

8580.88 --> 8585.88
know I don't need NASA to tell me that

8584.52 --> 8589.52
what's going

8585.88 --> 8593.039999999999
on I could have I had figured that out

8589.52 --> 8593.04
when they first started this

8597.04 --> 8603.68
crap yeah you want to

8601.0 --> 8607.319
do the environment of favor start

8603.68 --> 8610.439
pumping out CO2 it's that freaking

8607.319 --> 8614.72
simple it's that simple it's that simple

8610.439 --> 8617.359
it's literally that simple yeah supposed

8614.72 --> 8620.278999999999
climate change activist

8617.359 --> 8622.24
environmentalists are anti-

8620.279 --> 8625.319000000001
environmentalists they are people that

8622.24 --> 8627.84
hate nature they hate Humanity their

8625.319 --> 8630.278999999999
solution is to kill all life that's what

8627.84 --> 8633.84
they're bragging about right now in

8630.279 --> 8637.279
their they crazy little environmentalist

8633.84 --> 8640.279
clubs they're cult clubs that's their

8637.279 --> 8643.0
solution complete extermination of all

8640.279 --> 8645.6
life not just humans yeah to save the

8643.0 --> 8647.96
environment we have to kill everything

8645.6 --> 8651.800000000001
it's the only

8647.96 --> 8651.8
solution they're [ __ ]

8652.68 --> 8661.04
insane yeah I love nature I am super pro

8656.84 --> 8662.960000000001
nature I'm like a a recycling guy even

8661.04 --> 8665.92
though it's supposedly

8662.96 --> 8667.599999999999
statistically ineffective to recycle I

8665.92 --> 8671.439
still want to do

8667.6 --> 8673.92
it yeah I still want clean nature like I

8671.439 --> 8673.92
don't

8674.88 --> 8681.278999999999
care but like emission

8678.08 --> 8686.2
concerns it's all

8681.279 --> 8686.2
crap they're not talking about pollution

8686.24 --> 8691.56
yeah the actual pollution emissions have

8689.6 --> 8694.439
been dealt with is like figure out like

8691.56 --> 8696.8
o these gases yeah they are like toxic

8694.439 --> 8699.359
they are poisonous to the environment

8696.8 --> 8701.8
literally it's like everything is dying

8699.359 --> 8703.720000000001
out because of this gas emission okay

8701.8 --> 8705.438999999998
well we're going to have to then scrub

8703.72 --> 8708.399
that gas and make sure that that doesn't

8705.439 --> 8711.64
happen that it that it's contained

8708.399 --> 8713.119999999999
that's kept safe away from nature and

8711.64 --> 8714.72
then that's what they did that's what

8713.12 --> 8717.880000000001
they did throughout the 20th century

8714.72 --> 8720.16
they clean up the industrial crap and

8717.88 --> 8721.96
then only clean stuff comes out like

8720.16 --> 8725.039999999999
with the coal plants the advanced coal

8721.96 --> 8727.278999999999
plants coal power plants yeah there used

8725.04 --> 8730.359
to be all kinds of toxic crap that came

8727.279 --> 8733.04
out of that it would like rain down and

8730.359 --> 8736.359
and kill crops and make people sick and

8733.04 --> 8736.359
pollute wellwater

8738.84 --> 8745.04
Etc yeah and then they figured out oh we

8742.479 --> 8747.319
have scrubbers we need scrubbers and

8745.04 --> 8751.240000000002
then the only thing that came out was

8747.319 --> 8752.6
water vapor and CO2

8751.24 --> 8755.84
and that's

8752.6 --> 8759.2
good like it's not just oh well that's

8755.84 --> 8764.52
not toxic that's cool no it's

8759.2 --> 8768.880000000001
good plus good only good it's a win-win

8764.52 --> 8773.399000000001
you get power and you get CO2 and water

8768.88 --> 8775.438999999998
vapor it's a win it's a surplus it's

8773.399 --> 8781.16
extra

8775.439 --> 8781.16
Advantage yeah that's the reality of it

8783.359 --> 8789.319
but these Neo Eugenics environmentalists

8787.08 --> 8792.399
these cultists they're

8789.319 --> 8795.08
anti-environmentalist they are

8792.399 --> 8797.92
Marxist and they're fooling everybody

8795.08 --> 8800.439
into supposedly being environmental when

8797.92 --> 8802.76
they are nothing

8800.439 --> 8805.08
environmental they're

8802.76 --> 8809.0
anti-environmental they're antihuman

8805.08 --> 8809.0
anti-life anti-environmental

8810.64 --> 8815.68
and they claim to be environmental like

8812.56 --> 8817.92
typical marxists do they're not

8815.68 --> 8822.279
environmental if they were they

8817.92 --> 8828.2
stimulate they say more CO2 yeah in that

8822.279 --> 8831.720000000001
sense it's like China is actually more

8828.2 --> 8833.720000000001
environmental how dare you they're not

8831.72 --> 8835.08
doing it clean yeah yeah we know yeah

8833.72 --> 8837.039999999999
that's a problem right they have a

8835.08 --> 8841.56
pollution

8837.04 --> 8843.800000000001
problem so if China would actually have

8841.56 --> 8847.519999999999
all these power plants and all that [ __ ]

8843.8 --> 8849.92
and do it the clean way they'd be the

8847.52 --> 8849.92
better

8851.0 --> 8857.12
environmentalists CU then there's no

8853.2 --> 8859.560000000001
pollution for nature and more CO2 and

8857.12 --> 8861.800000000001
water vapor and such and which is good

8859.56 --> 8863.92
for nature everything would Thrive their

8861.8 --> 8865.96
food production would Thrive nature

8863.92 --> 8869.72
would Thrive everything would Thrive

8865.96 --> 8869.72
everything would be better

8872.279 --> 8877.399000000001
cuz that's the solution for real

8874.6 --> 8878.68
environmentalism you scrub the actual

8877.399 --> 8882.519999999999
poisons

8878.68 --> 8885.359
out and then you let the rest out into

8882.52 --> 8887.08
nature which is going to be CO2 and it

8885.359 --> 8893.04
is

8887.08 --> 8896.439
good yeah climate change CO2 is bad it's

8893.04 --> 8899.12
evil it's satanic it's literally the

8896.439 --> 8904.479000000001
opposite of physical

8899.12 --> 8907.720000000001
reality it's a Marxist scam a lie a

8904.479 --> 8911.319
criminal lie it's unbelievably evil and

8907.72 --> 8914.56
if you give into that lie you will

8911.319 --> 8916.72
assist in the dimming down and

8914.56 --> 8920.16
destruction of our

8916.72 --> 8922.72
life which is what it will inevitably

8920.16 --> 8927.76
lead to if you're foolish enough to

8922.72 --> 8927.76
allow them to do those things

8934.56 --> 8940.16
if you're a real environmentalist you'd

8937.0 --> 8943.52
be Pro CO2

8940.16 --> 8945.92
emission you would be like you know what

8943.52 --> 8948.0
electric cars are kind of cool you know

8945.92 --> 8951.56
they're like smooth

8948.0 --> 8954.359
and the air is better to breathe around

8951.56 --> 8957.68
it right because I mean yeah gasoline

8954.359 --> 8959.640000000001
exhaust I mean it is kind of stinky I I

8957.68 --> 8962.479000000001
don't I do kind of like the electric

8959.64 --> 8966.08
cars because of that but on the other

8962.479 --> 8969.24
hand yeah it also has less CO2 emission

8966.08 --> 8972.439
Which is less good for the direct

8969.24 --> 8974.6
environment so it's like neutral it's a

8972.439 --> 8977.04
neutral outcome right I mean you have

8974.6 --> 8979.0
like the gasoline Vapors which is not so

8977.04 --> 8981.479000000001
good for the environment but you also

8979.0 --> 8984.12
have the higher CO2 emission which is

8981.479 --> 8987.88
actually better for the environment but

8984.12 --> 8987.880000000001
now you don't have that but you

8987.96 --> 8993.599999999999
have you have no

8991.439 --> 8996.08
gasoline

8993.6 --> 8999.08
pollution but you don't have the CO2

8996.08 --> 9001.88
either so it's like neutral but at the

8999.08 --> 9003.72
same time yeah the CO2 is

9001.88 --> 9007.399
getting

9003.72 --> 9010.039999999999
expanded in power generation anyway is

9007.399 --> 9013.0
it's it's all pointless the whole thing

9010.04 --> 9013.0
is incredibly

9014.6 --> 9022.52
pointless yeah you want better

9018.279 --> 9022.52
environment more cold power

9024.479 --> 9031.119999999999
plants like that is the best solution

9028.8 --> 9033.119999999999
for nature like it's even better than

9031.12 --> 9036.560000000001
nuclear

9033.12 --> 9039.2
power coal power plants yeah you that's

9036.56 --> 9041.199999999999
like the most

9039.2 --> 9042.960000000001
pro-environmental thing you could

9041.2 --> 9046.52
possibly

9042.96 --> 9048.8
imagine there's nothing more

9046.52 --> 9050.84
pro-environmental than having coal power

9048.8 --> 9053.599999999999
plants everywhere like with the

9050.84 --> 9053.6
scrubbers and

9066.96 --> 9072.839999999998
everything limits yeah that's absolute

9069.6 --> 9076.16
hor [ __ ] diver en that and yeah yeah if

9072.84 --> 9077.8
you cut down all the nature yeah then it

9076.16 --> 9081.8
doesn't

9077.8 --> 9081.8
work yeah

9081.84 --> 9087.2
but I mean more than it can absorb is

9084.6 --> 9090.68
nonsense it spreads around everywhere

9087.2 --> 9095.52
and it will then nature will grow to

9090.68 --> 9095.52
meet the amount that's just what

9095.84 --> 9102.08
happens

9097.439 --> 9104.68
yeah more CO2 does not ruin agriculture

9102.08 --> 9108.039999999999
or nature it doesn't

9104.68 --> 9110.2
it's cutting down nature that's going to

9108.04 --> 9112.479000000001
make the burden heavier and it is like

9110.2 --> 9114.84
other pollution other pollution is the

9112.479 --> 9114.84
real

9116.16 --> 9121.92
problem yeah and besides the [ __ ]

9119.24 --> 9125.76
Amazon rainforest is like that's like

9121.92 --> 9128.72
the only [ __ ] thing to which it might

9125.76 --> 9132.04
not be applying yeah like we're not

9128.72 --> 9134.96
talking about the [ __ ] Amazon

9132.04 --> 9137.640000000001
rainforest d Navy vet we're talking

9134.96 --> 9140.08
about everywhere else we're talking

9137.64 --> 9142.76
about the entirety of Europe the

9140.08 --> 9146.08
entirety of the America the entirety of

9142.76 --> 9148.84
China like all of the [ __ ] world

9146.08 --> 9151.16
except the [ __ ] Amazon rainforest

9148.84 --> 9152.8
yeah it's like the only thing maybe that

9151.16 --> 9156.119999999999
doesn't apply

9152.8 --> 9158.479
there because the Amazon rainforest is

9156.12 --> 9161.84
like a different type of

9158.479 --> 9165.199999999999
ecosystem yeah so yeah maybe the Amazon

9161.84 --> 9168.64
rainforest is not the place to build

9165.2 --> 9171.08
coal power plants everywhere like maybe

9168.64 --> 9174.479
that piece of nature is not super

9171.08 --> 9178.039999999999
suitable for that okay yeah but every

9174.479 --> 9182.039999999999
[ __ ] where else in the world is and

9178.04 --> 9186.399000000001
all the other places thrive on extra CO2

9182.04 --> 9189.720000000001
CO2 emission everywhere

9186.399 --> 9192.278999999999
else but maybe not the Amazon

9189.72 --> 9195.319
rainforest that's really [ __ ] cute

9192.279 --> 9198.720000000001
that you'd bring that up yeah my case

9195.319 --> 9202.84
stands though everywhere else yeah it's

9198.72 --> 9205.92
good you can literally turn deserts into

9202.84 --> 9209.2
green grass fields with more CO2

9205.92 --> 9209.2
emission and that is

9210.92 --> 9213.92
happening

9216.68 --> 9223.56
yeah

9218.319 --> 9226.6
CO2 is critical to

9223.56 --> 9227.56
terraforming they literally even admit

9226.6 --> 9230.720000000001
that

9227.56 --> 9232.68
yeah terraforming it's like a Sci-Fi

9230.72 --> 9235.479
futurist concept of what you would do

9232.68 --> 9238.399
with that planets or whatever right

9235.479 --> 9242.24
colonization terraforming yeah what do

9238.399 --> 9246.0
you do well you start with the little

9242.24 --> 9249.8
CO2 emission yeah that's literally part

9246.0 --> 9255.399
of it yeah terraforming turning it into

9249.8 --> 9258.399
a green livable planet with plant life

9255.399 --> 9262.72
what do you need CO2

9258.399 --> 9264.8
emissions yeah that's known that's like

9262.72 --> 9266.72
knowledge that's been there like mid

9264.8 --> 9270.679999999998
20th

9266.72 --> 9274.679999999998
century yeah so what what do we need

9270.68 --> 9277.800000000001
more CO2 emission that's exactly what we

9274.68 --> 9284.04
need not [ __ ] carbon tax which is

9277.8 --> 9284.039999999999
literally a tax on life can't be more

9285.64 --> 9291.399
literal it's satanic it needs to stop

9289.16 --> 9294.119999999999
the scam needs to stop how many more

9291.399 --> 9295.16
decades do we all need to suffer under

9294.12 --> 9297.2
this

9295.16 --> 9300.039999999999
insane

9297.2 --> 9302.04
satanic policy that's

9300.04 --> 9305.720000000001
anti-environmentalist how long do we

9302.04 --> 9305.720000000001
still need to suffer under

9318.64 --> 9322.68
this for

9364.12 --> 9370.479000000001
so yeah I mean it's cool maybe there is

9367.12 --> 9372.359
like infinite potential for electricity

9370.479 --> 9375.56
that's all free and we just get it out

9372.359 --> 9380.04
of the air and we don't need to burn any

9375.56 --> 9382.519999999999
coal or wood or gas or anything yeah I

9380.04 --> 9384.52
bet you could until you tap into that

9382.52 --> 9386.68
power a little bit too much and then you

9384.52 --> 9389.359
get sudden plasma storms and then a

9386.68 --> 9393.6
giant flood and then everybody's dead

9389.359 --> 9395.92
probably right I mean well that's just

9393.6 --> 9398.0
rumors oh no we're going to definitely

9395.92 --> 9400.52
do that yeah I'm

9398.0 --> 9404.92
not the point is is

9400.52 --> 9407.319000000001
that okay so maybe burning coal to for

9404.92 --> 9410.399
electric power plants is not like the

9407.319 --> 9414.399
best idea ever it's maybe little bit

9410.399 --> 9417.599999999999
oldd outdated it's oldfashioned yeah but

9414.399 --> 9420.599999999999
just for the CO2 emission it's actually

9417.6 --> 9422.56
worth it just for that it's not even to

9420.6 --> 9426.319
get the power from it it's just for the

9422.56 --> 9430.68
extra CO2 emission that is worth

9426.319 --> 9430.68
it it's necessary

9443.72 --> 9451.599999999999
progress coil was yeah no no it's still

9448.399 --> 9454.8
great I don't see I don't even see why

9451.6 --> 9457.479000000001
it is supposedly not ideal fish finger

9454.8 --> 9460.119999999999
you're just saying that what are you

9457.479 --> 9460.119999999999
basing that

9460.319 --> 9469.56
on what are you basing it not being out

9464.0 --> 9469.56
out ideal on why is it outdated

9470.64 --> 9473.16
you tell

9489.279 --> 9495.2
me that what if I change your entire

9492.359 --> 9497.800000000001
perspective on the entire thing with Co

9495.2 --> 9501.319000000001
what if it was literally placed there by

9497.8 --> 9506.479
God because we have to burn

9501.319 --> 9506.479
it it has to be dug out and

9507.2 --> 9511.0
burnt because it's

9511.479 --> 9516.84
necessary have you ever thought of it

9513.6 --> 9516.84
like that

9529.64 --> 9534.72
a coal minine pollutes the [ __ ] out of

9531.96 --> 9536.479
the Environ yeah any mine of any sort

9534.72 --> 9540.479
pollutes the [ __ ] out of the direct

9536.479 --> 9543.479
environment that's what mins do fish

9540.479 --> 9543.479
fingers

9548.04 --> 9556.080000000002
yeah and then when the mining's done

9552.479 --> 9558.72
it's over it gets close you let nature

9556.08 --> 9560.8
do its thing and guess what Nature's

9558.72 --> 9565.08
just [ __ ]

9560.8 --> 9565.08
fine and it restores like

9568.24 --> 9574.479
completely yeah the only reason why with

9572.16 --> 9577.08
coal mines it wouldn't restore

9574.479 --> 9579.679999999998
completely is well because it literally

9577.08 --> 9581.96
never ends the coal mining just never

9579.68 --> 9585.76
ends it never runs out there's like so

9581.96 --> 9589.679999999998
[ __ ] much of it it just never runs

9585.76 --> 9592.12
out and thus the mining never stops and

9589.68 --> 9594.08
thus the nature never really gets the

9592.12 --> 9598.560000000001
chance to like grow

9594.08 --> 9598.56
back cuz it this just never

9606.08 --> 9612.56
ends yeah Richard G now that's yeah I

9609.279 --> 9614.68
mean sure let nature remove you yeah do

9612.56 --> 9617.88
it then I don't think nature removes us

9614.68 --> 9617.880000000001
at all

9622.399 --> 9626.68
I mean if we're really doing such a bad

9624.72 --> 9630.119999999999
job it's just going to slap Us in the

9626.68 --> 9630.12
face for a bit and that's

9646.8 --> 9652.72
it right so let me bring you another

9649.439 --> 9656.24
other hypothesis imagine that all of

9652.72 --> 9658.438999999998
humanity suddenly like evaporated all of

9656.24 --> 9661.76
it just we all suddenly

9658.439 --> 9666.76
disappear it's all gone boom No More

9661.76 --> 9670.800000000001
Humans none no humans zero it's all gone

9666.76 --> 9670.800000000001
you really think that nature is going to

9673.439 --> 9680.960000000001
thrive what if I told you that nature

9676.84 --> 9685.68
would actually risk die dying

9680.96 --> 9688.88
out way more if all of humanity stopped

9685.68 --> 9692.2
being and stopped doing what they do

9688.88 --> 9695.438999999998
stop burning stuff and digging up stuff

9692.2 --> 9698.52
and burning it up and emitting CO2 what

9695.439 --> 9703.0
if I told you that actually nature would

9698.52 --> 9705.479000000001
probably die in the span of say 20 to 50

9703.0 --> 9708.68
years would like completely and

9705.479 --> 9712.199999999999
permanently die everywhere like

9708.68 --> 9716.800000000001
including jungles that it would die

9712.2 --> 9718.960000000001
out if there was no human activity in

9716.8 --> 9718.96
the

9722.0 --> 9729.04
realm cuz it's all working it's all been

9726.479 --> 9733.438999999998
working for hundreds of years thousands

9729.04 --> 9735.880000000001
of years with humans right there so how

9733.439 --> 9738.880000000001
would you know that it would be able to

9735.88 --> 9743.64
do any of those things if humans didn't

9738.88 --> 9743.64
do what they did in all that

9747.2 --> 9753.2
time yeah Stephen you're just assuming

9750.52 --> 9754.960000000001
that nature survives without us you have

9753.2 --> 9757.800000000001
no evidence that it

9754.96 --> 9760.278999999999
does yeah your evidence is like oh wow

9757.8 --> 9762.319
look at this island it's an island and

9760.279 --> 9764.12
it's all that nature all so beautiful

9762.319 --> 9767.119999999999
and humans don't come there oh look it's

9764.12 --> 9768.800000000001
so untouched it would do so much better

9767.12 --> 9770.84
without us yeah but that Island still

9768.8 --> 9774.96
open ly connected to the rest of the

9770.84 --> 9778.68
world it has been able to freely

9774.96 --> 9781.8
unobstructed absorb all the CO2 that has

9778.68 --> 9781.800000000001
been created by

9782.16 --> 9788.64
industry all the other stuff that humans

9786.16 --> 9791.08
dumped including poisons too and all

9788.64 --> 9793.84
that but also good stuff with its

9791.08 --> 9796.76
activity and then yeah it could just sit

9793.84 --> 9799.76
there and absorb that yeah that's it

9796.76 --> 9799.76
enjoyed

9799.92 --> 9804.479
the Privileges of having humans around

9802.399 --> 9806.8
and their

9804.479 --> 9809.119999999999
activities yeah you're just assuming

9806.8 --> 9813.358999999999
that nature can survive without us I'm

9809.12 --> 9815.84
telling you uh yeah you might have like

9813.359 --> 9820.0
you very typically right very typically

9815.84 --> 9823.64
for the programming of the CO2 emissions

9820.0 --> 9825.64
danger climate change yeah of these

9823.64 --> 9828.0
environmentalist marxists that

9825.64 --> 9830.24
everything they say everything they

9828.0 --> 9832.12
suggest the Imager in your mind that

9830.24 --> 9834.479
they want you to have like oh nature

9832.12 --> 9840.12
would just live so well without us that

9834.479 --> 9842.64
it's all a lie all of it everything

9840.12 --> 9845.52
about it is exactly the opposite of

9842.64 --> 9850.56
reality yeah I believe that if humans

9845.52 --> 9850.560000000001
weren't there I think nature would

9851.56 --> 9857.039999999999
die it would die

9854.279 --> 9859.6
out and you could even connect that up

9857.04 --> 9862.84
to like biblical logic if you're going

9859.6 --> 9865.960000000001
to assume that God designed this world

9862.84 --> 9870.72
for humans well if humans wouldn't be

9865.96 --> 9870.72
there then why would it continue

9871.0 --> 9876.399
existing the way it

9873.479 --> 9878.438999999998
is if it is all designed for humans

9876.399 --> 9881.599999999999
wouldn't humans be an essential

9878.439 --> 9881.6
ingredient in its

9887.439 --> 9894.2
functioning fall so few FU oh Steven J

9890.52 --> 9897.52
yeah yeah keep keep rolling out the

9894.2 --> 9899.92
standardized program yeah first off

9897.52 --> 9904.279
there are no fossil fuels you have

9899.92 --> 9904.279
fossils don't make fuels

9904.439 --> 9909.880000000001
ever

9906.12 --> 9913.76
and there's infinite there's infinite

9909.88 --> 9917.199999999999
oil there is more gas

9913.76 --> 9919.64
than that we could ever ex than we could

9917.2 --> 9922.16
ever use up in our lifetime and it

9919.64 --> 9925.358999999999
arguably too

9922.16 --> 9928.439
refills yeah all these resources that we

9925.359 --> 9931.04
use they keep refilling

9928.439 --> 9932.92
themselves just keep doing it right and

9931.04 --> 9935.2
if it it doesn't refill like if it's an

9932.92 --> 9937.88
ore mine it's something you cut out of a

9935.2 --> 9941.399000000001
mountain or even the coal well guess

9937.88 --> 9945.278999999999
what we keep going and going oh oh we

9941.399 --> 9949.08
find more oh there's more there holy

9945.279 --> 9952.6
[ __ ] after a century we finally mine out

9949.08 --> 9955.56
this spot and then oh there's like four

9952.6 --> 9959.0
times as much as was here entirely all

9955.56 --> 9962.479
that time over there it's like it never

9959.0 --> 9966.16
ends guys it never ends it never runs

9962.479 --> 9969.679999999998
out it just keeps being

9966.16 --> 9969.68
more all the

9970.399 --> 9976.199999999999
time it just never runs

9973.56 --> 9979.278999999999
out

9976.2 --> 9982.6
practically yeah oil wells refill them

9979.279 --> 9985.720000000001
themselves arguably gas is produced in a

9982.6 --> 9988.640000000001
similar AB biotic way as oil so it's

9985.72 --> 9991.119999999999
likely that it too refills itself I

9988.64 --> 9993.319
don't exactly know how that would work

9991.12 --> 9997.0
but there's places like in Russia where

9993.319 --> 10000.439
there's so much gas it's

9997.0 --> 10002.12
like they have to mine it just to

10000.439 --> 10006.16
prevent potential

10002.12 --> 10010.52
cataclysm yeah that's how much of it is

10006.16 --> 10015.279
there like they have to tap into it or

10010.52 --> 10015.279
the entire world could die from gas

10019.359 --> 10027.2
poisoning it it's it's crazy this world

10023.68 --> 10029.800000000001
is crazy and everything these [ __ ]

10027.2 --> 10032.640000000001
claim change environmentalists tell us

10029.8 --> 10037.0
with their stupid antihuman Eugenics

10032.64 --> 10040.08
propaganda everything they say is

10037.0 --> 10043.24
wrong all their ideas that they plant in

10040.08 --> 10046.12
US is exactly the opposite of reality

10043.24 --> 10049.96
like in every way it

10046.12 --> 10052.12
is exactly the opposite of reality and

10049.96 --> 10056.358999999999
that's why this climate

10052.12 --> 10059.880000000001
cultism is so [ __ ] dangerous and evil

10056.359 --> 10062.319
because it is fundamentally satanic not

10059.88 --> 10067.0
because oh they do the rituals

10062.319 --> 10069.439
and oh oh the I and the three three

10067.0 --> 10073.279
three three whatever right no no no no

10069.439 --> 10076.92
not that no everything they say is

10073.279 --> 10079.880000000001
exactly the opposite of reality that's

10076.92 --> 10082.76
how it is satanic it is reversed worlded

10079.88 --> 10086.119999999999
sat satanic everything that comes out of

10082.76 --> 10089.84
these climate change propagandist is

10086.12 --> 10093.2
exactly the opposite of reality and so

10089.84 --> 10096.24
if you get caught up in that you're in a

10093.2 --> 10100.240000000002
satanic cult you're in the Reversed

10096.24 --> 10102.84
world it's exactly the opposite of

10100.24 --> 10105.399
reality everything that you think you're

10102.84 --> 10107.56
doing you're doing out of a good

10105.399 --> 10110.56
motivation but you don't realize that

10107.56 --> 10114.08
because you're in a reversed World cult

10110.56 --> 10116.88
the result will always be exactly the

10114.08 --> 10119.279
opposite of what you thought it would be

10116.88 --> 10122.96
because you're in a reversed World cult

10119.279 --> 10125.6
which is what climate change cultism is

10122.96 --> 10127.24
it's antihuman

10125.6 --> 10130.2
Eugenics

10127.24 --> 10132.119999999999
anti-life Satan

10130.2 --> 10134.800000000001
everything that comes out of there is

10132.12 --> 10136.960000000001
exactly the opposite of reality

10134.8 --> 10140.119999999999
everything that they suggest as a

10136.96 --> 10142.039999999999
solution causes the problem that they're

10140.12 --> 10147.240000000002
trying to heed you

10142.04 --> 10150.76
from every single [ __ ]

10147.24 --> 10153.52
time they don't have

10150.76 --> 10156.16
solutions they don't have solutions for

10153.52 --> 10159.960000000001
problems that didn't exist they only

10156.16 --> 10162.2
have problems that they create

10159.96 --> 10164.199999999999
by claiming that that that that problem

10162.2 --> 10167.08
is a problem that needs to be solved and

10164.2 --> 10170.2
then their solution will create that

10167.08 --> 10173.8
problem that did not exist before they

10170.2 --> 10173.800000000001
created it

10191.439 --> 10196.399
they keep drilling because it refills no

10193.76 --> 10196.399
they just want

10198.96 --> 10203.399
more they want more and they want it

10211.0 --> 10214.88
quicker yeah and it's all about

10213.16 --> 10217.92
logistics I mean yeah if you certain

10214.88 --> 10219.96
regions are going to keep drilling well

10217.92 --> 10222.12
that's not because oh it's running out

10219.96 --> 10224.919999999998
now it's because places where there is

10222.12 --> 10228.960000000001
like huge

10224.92 --> 10232.0
Surplus huge amount of oil production

10228.96 --> 10234.72
way too much yeah they're not making

10232.0 --> 10237.08
deals they're not going to give that oil

10234.72 --> 10240.679999999998
they're holding it back it's called

10237.08 --> 10244.08
artificial scarcity it's called Big

10240.68 --> 10245.720000000001
Business Big Oil Business yeah so then

10244.08 --> 10247.239
certain countries are like yeah we're

10245.72 --> 10249.599999999999
going to have to drill

10247.239 --> 10252.76
because we're not not getting all that

10249.6 --> 10256.92
Surplus from over there it's not because

10252.76 --> 10256.92
there's a shortage of oil it's just

10256.96 --> 10263.0
because it's they're not they're not in

10260.56 --> 10266.16
the right

10263.0 --> 10269.56
spot they're not making the deals where

10266.16 --> 10273.08
with these locations where the oil is a

10269.56 --> 10275.56
surplus right that's how it

10273.08 --> 10279.68
works it's like oh there's a gas

10275.56 --> 10283.399
shortage in Europe like uh

10279.68 --> 10286.319
no no there is tons of gas production in

10283.399 --> 10288.8
Russia we're just not taking

10286.319 --> 10293.0
it yeah that doesn't mean oh there's

10288.8 --> 10293.0
such a gas shortage no there

10295.16 --> 10299.68
isn't not at all

10328.319 --> 10333.399
yeah all right anyway hope everybody's

10331.08 --> 10337.96
enjoying the show it's very

10333.399 --> 10337.96
environmentalism oriented today

10342.76 --> 10350.2
it's good to have a steady subject like

10346.64 --> 10352.479
that all right two minute break I'll be

10350.2 --> 10352.479000000001
right

10367.439 --> 10370.439
back

10397.439 --> 10400.439
e

10427.439 --> 10431.359
e for

10479.64 --> 10483.119999999999
and I'm back

10501.319 --> 10506.359
have a rule th if Greta

10506.52 --> 10511.279
thunberg says to do it

10509.04 --> 10515.279
don't well when it comes to

10511.279 --> 10515.279
environmentalism yeah

10527.2 --> 10534.92
ground Source heat

10530.56 --> 10534.92
pumps uh no

10558.68 --> 10562.479000000001
anti-water what are you talking about

10566.12 --> 10571.439
fibs what do you mean yes no

10591.12 --> 10596.0
Fat Cats yeah fish finger yeah hey

10593.6 --> 10599.04
robber barons oil Baron yeah I know it's

10596.0 --> 10602.76
a problem right

10599.04 --> 10606.640000000001
uh I'm sorry but that's like that's a

10602.76 --> 10610.72
organization that's a corporate problem

10606.64 --> 10614.16
yeah if you're okay okay with oil then

10610.72 --> 10614.16
break up the oil

10616.319 --> 10623.6
Barr that's it

10620.359 --> 10627.08
yeah make it into an actual free market

10623.6 --> 10627.08
again just like break

10627.479 --> 10634.519999999999
up Big Oil

10630.08 --> 10635.52
Tech like make it public make that Tech

10634.52 --> 10638.84
that

10635.52 --> 10642.08
technology it's like de privatizing and

10638.84 --> 10644.08
just say like Okay nowbody can just be

10642.08 --> 10647.039999999999
their own little Oil Company everybody

10644.08 --> 10650.319
can be a little oil baren for One Source

10647.04 --> 10652.560000000001
right and just like total oil production

10650.319 --> 10655.68
everywhere and it's all optimized and

10652.56 --> 10659.319
it's all like high-tech stuff Avail like

10655.68 --> 10660.800000000001
the oil oil the old oil Barrens would

10659.319 --> 10663.119999999999
then

10660.8 --> 10665.039999999999
become because they can't function with

10663.12 --> 10667.640000000001
their monopolies anymore they would just

10665.04 --> 10671.080000000002
become the providers of the Hightech

10667.64 --> 10673.72
technology ology for the general oil

10671.08 --> 10676.52
production Market they would just

10673.72 --> 10678.88
provide the gear for every little oil

10676.52 --> 10681.76
baring that's going to be out there that

10678.88 --> 10681.759999999998
would be their new

10682.76 --> 10687.359
market and it would make oil incredibly

10692.439 --> 10697.880000000001
cheap yeah I mean I get it monopolies

10695.319 --> 10699.84
are very annoying but you can actually

10697.88 --> 10702.358999999999
do do something about it you know there

10699.84 --> 10705.56
there used to be antimonopoly

10702.359 --> 10707.720000000001
laws in the United States seems like

10705.56 --> 10710.16
everybody's just forgotten about those

10707.72 --> 10714.96
it's like although they don't exist they

10710.16 --> 10714.96
only apply to our political

10715.04 --> 10723.319000000001
opponents it's not we don't use monopoly

10719.08 --> 10725.2
laws except to take down our political

10723.319 --> 10727.64
opponents

10725.2 --> 10731.800000000001
yes that's what they were meant for

10727.64 --> 10735.439
right not to actually like create a free

10731.8 --> 10735.438999999998
market or anything

10760.319 --> 10768.16
just don't use oil no that's

10764.84 --> 10771.72
ridiculous if you don't use oil then the

10768.16 --> 10775.439
freaking oil wells are going to just

10771.72 --> 10779.0
throw it onto the surface yeah that's

10775.439 --> 10782.319
what used to happen before people

10779.0 --> 10785.2
actually started drilling for oil it's

10782.319 --> 10790.039999999999
called Tar

10785.2 --> 10790.04
Pits yeah it was everywhere

10796.319 --> 10802.479
just don't use oil well the oil's going

10799.72 --> 10805.08
to be in your face

10802.479 --> 10806.56
anyway it's going to be there anyway

10805.08 --> 10809.279
it's what oil

10806.56 --> 10811.76
does yeah if you don't drill for it it's

10809.279 --> 10816.76
just going to find its own way to the

10811.76 --> 10816.76
surface and then you get tar pits

10821.279 --> 10827.239
yeah and O breaking up billionaires I

10825.479 --> 10830.08
mean yeah that's one thing you could

10827.239 --> 10833.16
just take you don't have to like even

10830.08 --> 10836.8
break up billionaires you just take away

10833.16 --> 10838.6
their market system yeah you take away

10836.8 --> 10843.319
their

10838.6 --> 10847.12
Monopoly you put rules on the

10843.319 --> 10849.64
corporations on the big ones yeah that

10847.12 --> 10852.0
that's what what antimonopoly laws used

10849.64 --> 10854.119999999999
to be for I mean we everybody seems to

10852.0 --> 10855.84
just forget how that works like

10854.12 --> 10859.6
antimonopoly

10855.84 --> 10862.08
laws broke up super mega corporate

10859.6 --> 10865.479000000001
structures that were all monolithic and

10862.08 --> 10868.399
overpaid and [ __ ] that ruined small

10865.479 --> 10872.039999999999
business you break up the big ones and

10868.399 --> 10874.56
then you enable the small ones that's

10872.04 --> 10877.319000000001
antimonopoly laws you can do that with

10874.56 --> 10878.8
anything it you don't need to like

10877.319 --> 10881.278999999999
arrest

10878.8 --> 10884.438999999998
the billionaires and take their money

10881.279 --> 10887.84
you just disable the way that they do

10884.439 --> 10890.239
business and keep the Monopoly that way

10887.84 --> 10893.2
that's how you do it that's how you

10890.239 --> 10896.319
apply antimonopoly

10893.2 --> 10900.439
laws it's just like people just forgot

10896.319 --> 10903.199999999999
that that was used to be a thing it's

10900.439 --> 10906.64
ridiculous that's how we

10903.2 --> 10909.84
works that still you that was still done

10906.64 --> 10909.84
in the 20th century

10913.279 --> 10921.04
and then it just stopped got the whole

10915.88 --> 10924.278999999999
Neo Marxist New World Order crap

10921.04 --> 10928.6
movement satanic environmentalism and

10924.279 --> 10931.08
all this crazy [ __ ] and monopoly laws

10928.6 --> 10932.960000000001
are just like oh that doesn't exist

10931.08 --> 10935.319
anymore because now we're going to

10932.96 --> 10938.96
completely abuse the monopolies we're

10935.319 --> 10941.6
going to use it for our political power

10938.96 --> 10942.679999999998
so now yeah monopoly laws don't apply

10941.6 --> 10946.359
anymore

10942.68 --> 10948.279
because well monopoly laws don't apply

10946.359 --> 10950.6
because they're not being

10948.279 --> 10952.84
applied that's basically what it comes

10950.6 --> 10952.84
down

10954.439 --> 10963.049
to yeah somebody has to apply them

10959.92 --> 10963.049
[Music]

10970.72 --> 10976.519999999999
never knew it was that abundant yeah

10972.319 --> 10976.519999999999
fibro it's oil's always been extremely

10976.76 --> 10981.800000000001
abundant I mean and that doesn't mean

10979.0 --> 10984.52
that it's that oil is literally

10981.8 --> 10986.56
everywhere what I mean oil is pretty

10984.52 --> 10988.800000000001
much on every single

10986.56 --> 10991.0
continent everywhere so it is

10988.8 --> 10996.039999999999
technically everywhere it's just not

10991.0 --> 11000.76
everywhere on every square foot right

10996.04 --> 11004.720000000001
but every Contin has oil and some places

11000.76 --> 11008.12
has so much oil it's insane like it's

11004.72 --> 11010.519999999999
just too much oil right that's how

11008.12 --> 11010.52
that's the

11014.279 --> 11022.279
reality like in Saudi

11017.68 --> 11027.279
Arabia they always have too much oil

11022.279 --> 11029.560000000001
always they will never run out never

11027.279 --> 11033.640000000001
they could be pump in like another 100

11029.56 --> 11033.64
years and they'll never run

11040.239 --> 11045.319
out there is a lot of

11051.84 --> 11056.08
oil not going

11061.479 --> 11065.96
I don't know who the [ __ ] you are fish

11063.12 --> 11069.560000000001
fingers but I don't like you you seem to

11065.96 --> 11072.119999999999
be like a stinky environmentalist

11069.56 --> 11074.519999999999
CST I think you're going to get ended up

11072.12 --> 11075.560000000001
you're going to get kicked out because I

11074.52 --> 11079.359
don't

11075.56 --> 11079.359
accept psychotic

11080.319 --> 11086.519999999999
satanists I don't accept environmental

11083.2 --> 11089.68
cultism yeah I'm not here to convince

11086.52 --> 11093.439
you that you're cult is wrong I will

11089.68 --> 11093.439
just excommunicate you

11100.0 --> 11107.239
immediately yeah because I don't care to

11102.8 --> 11107.239
convince you that you're a [ __ ]

11110.56 --> 11115.76
Satanist yeah I'm not here to convince

11112.92 --> 11118.0
you I'm just telling you if you're an

11115.76 --> 11120.399
environmentalist cultist you're a

11118.0 --> 11120.399
[ __ ]

11121.2 --> 11126.0
Satanist yeah not saying you're a

11123.52 --> 11131.359
Satanist but you seem to be arguing a

11126.0 --> 11135.439
lot for this environmentalism position

11131.359 --> 11137.04
crap and thereby you're a Satanist if if

11135.439 --> 11140.68
that is actually what you're attempting

11137.04 --> 11140.68
then yeah bye

11140.76 --> 11145.279
bye bye fish fingers

11152.64 --> 11158.439
yeah just remember what I told you

11156.319 --> 11161.0
you're an environmentalist cultist

11158.439 --> 11163.439
you're afraid of climate change you you

11161.0 --> 11166.2
think that overpopulation is a problem

11163.439 --> 11168.64
you're a Satanist everything you believe

11166.2 --> 11171.720000000001
is wrong all the solutions to the

11168.64 --> 11174.479
problems you think there are cause the

11171.72 --> 11176.319
problems because you're a Satanist and

11174.479 --> 11179.358999999999
everything you believe in is

11176.319 --> 11184.119999999999
wrong you're a cultist you live in the

11179.359 --> 11184.12
Reversed world everything you believe is

11185.56 --> 11191.0
wrong yeah all the solutions to the

11188.359 --> 11193.279
problems that you think are there cause

11191.0 --> 11193.279
the

11203.2 --> 11211.279
problems he believes in man bear pig

11206.04 --> 11212.800000000001
dude manbear pig is like a a very

11211.279 --> 11215.800000000001
reasonable

11212.8 --> 11219.239
idea compared to the the the threat of

11215.8 --> 11223.239
climate change like manbear pig is like

11219.239 --> 11226.92
yeah I mean why not it's it's weird like

11223.239 --> 11230.039999999999
oh this is weird hybrid mutant I'm like

11226.92 --> 11233.8
well pandas exist so why wouldn't man

11230.04 --> 11236.800000000001
bear pig exist you know somebody

11233.8 --> 11238.438999999998
probably made that I mean pandas are

11236.8 --> 11240.8
made they can't even even survive in the

11238.439 --> 11243.319
wild but they exist though and they're

11240.8 --> 11244.72
very popular supposedly and they keep

11243.319 --> 11248.88
getting

11244.72 --> 11250.92
made by the chin right so if a panda can

11248.88 --> 11252.519999999999
exist why wouldn't a man bear pig be

11250.92 --> 11254.359
able to exist it wouldn't be able to

11252.52 --> 11256.76
survive in nature and it's an

11254.359 --> 11259.720000000001
Abomination nobody would want to look at

11256.76 --> 11262.359
it but it could exist I mean the chances

11259.72 --> 11265.319
of manbear pig

11262.359 --> 11267.84
existing compared to the changes the

11265.319 --> 11271.278999999999
chances that anything about the climate

11267.84 --> 11273.479
change policy cultism is actually

11271.279 --> 11275.880000000001
correct and that their Solutions will

11273.479 --> 11277.519999999999
actually solve these Invision

11275.88 --> 11280.358999999999
problems

11277.52 --> 11283.08
like yeah I'll choose man bear pig over

11280.359 --> 11286.800000000001
that any day of the week

11283.08 --> 11290.64
cuz you could actually it like it might

11286.8 --> 11292.84
remotely be possible unlike anything

11290.64 --> 11295.239
that is climate change

11292.84 --> 11297.8
related CU everything that's climate

11295.239 --> 11299.72
change related is wrong and all the

11297.8 --> 11303.16
solutions to their supposed climate

11299.72 --> 11307.679999999998
change based problems cause more

11303.16 --> 11307.68
problems especially environmental

11322.16 --> 11328.96
problems ah there you go borders boy

11325.84 --> 11332.399
yeah oh we can't support your oh oh yeah

11328.96 --> 11334.8
here is another infinite oil Source

11332.399 --> 11334.8
there you

11335.399 --> 11341.72
go yeah I know borders boy it's never

11338.56 --> 11345.64
going to run out never

11341.72 --> 11348.399
never it's no fossil fuels there's no

11345.64 --> 11351.399
Source that's going to run out there's

11348.399 --> 11351.399
infinite

11352.12 --> 11356.12
infinite yeah

11360.239 --> 11364.8
I mean technically even if just

11362.399 --> 11367.239
everything would get blown up like just

11364.8 --> 11369.88
bombs everywhere all the oil field like

11367.239 --> 11372.64
boom boom boom boom everything boom boom

11369.88 --> 11377.199999999999
boom everything is blown up yeah well

11372.64 --> 11379.96
guess what 20 years infinite

11377.2 --> 11381.239000000001
resources again it's like oh everything

11379.96 --> 11384.438999999998
was destroyed well well guess what

11381.239 --> 11387.64
you'll find it all again you'll find

11384.439 --> 11388.92
that there is even more than that

11387.64 --> 11391.92
infinite

11388.92 --> 11391.92
resources

11398.96 --> 11406.438999999998
infinite yeah everything climate change

11402.8 --> 11410.679999999998
cultist say is

11406.439 --> 11413.2
wrong every train of thought that they

11410.68 --> 11416.84
take a discussion in to try to make

11413.2 --> 11419.800000000001
their case everything they say is wrong

11416.84 --> 11419.8
every single

11420.16 --> 11428.16
time cuz they're in the Reversed world

11424.319 --> 11431.16
they're Satan's slave they are a slave

11428.16 --> 11433.119999999999
of their lies and their lies are so

11431.16 --> 11434.359
thorough that they effectively live in

11433.12 --> 11436.92
the Reversed

11434.359 --> 11441.319
world everything is inside out

11436.92 --> 11441.319
everything that they think is a lie

11467.0 --> 11473.72
what about gas will that run out on the

11470.08 --> 11477.76
short run Steven Jaris but no

11473.72 --> 11482.239
technically no like gas is the same

11477.76 --> 11485.84
has the same nature I believe as oil

11482.239 --> 11489.239
it's abiotic it's produced by

11485.84 --> 11492.72
bacteria in the ground under pressure

11489.239 --> 11496.439
that causes the gas I mean it's

11492.72 --> 11501.0
like natural gas is basically like

11496.439 --> 11505.64
yeast it's pressure based yeast it

11501.0 --> 11508.439
just except yeast typically creates

11505.64 --> 11513.399
CO2 that blows up like that's why it's

11508.439 --> 11516.84
used in bread and all that right and

11513.399 --> 11519.119999999999
these gases these gas bacteria they

11516.84 --> 11520.479
actually create methane gas so that's

11519.12 --> 11522.68
becomes

11520.479 --> 11526.119999999999
combustible but it's yeah it's produced

11522.68 --> 11529.64
Under Pressure it it just

11526.12 --> 11534.479000000001
like it's Earth's fart yeah it keeps

11529.64 --> 11534.479
doing it it's going to keep happening

11537.439 --> 11542.92
like the bacteria we have in our guts

11539.64 --> 11546.16
that help us process food it's in the

11542.92 --> 11549.2
earth as well it creates gas bubbles we

11546.16 --> 11553.0
can tap in these gas bubbles and use

11549.2 --> 11556.0
them for fuel it's going to keep being

11553.0 --> 11559.96
made it's just happening now they're not

11556.0 --> 11559.96
dinosaur fars very funny step

11564.64 --> 11569.8
Jarvis crease producer oxygen yeah not

11567.72 --> 11573.239
just trees all

11569.8 --> 11575.64
plants but yeah Big Trees definitely do

11573.239 --> 11575.64
it a

11582.04 --> 11588.720000000001
lot yeah so real

11585.479 --> 11590.96
environmentalism should be very basic

11588.72 --> 11594.199999999999
start planting trees again yeah that's

11590.96 --> 11596.64
what it used to be now Bill Gates is

11594.2 --> 11598.76
supposedly on the edge environmentalist

11596.64 --> 11603.08
says now we we got to we got to cut down

11598.76 --> 11603.08
and bury the trees

11603.16 --> 11609.76
e yeah that makes a lot of damn sense no

11606.239 --> 11611.92
no environmentalism used to be you go

11609.76 --> 11614.16
out and plant a

11611.92 --> 11616.64
tree that's the thing that actually

11614.16 --> 11618.479
helps then some [ __ ] up there in the

11616.64 --> 11620.599999999999
power structure said like no that

11618.479 --> 11623.278999999999
doesn't actually help why did they say

11620.6 --> 11625.52
that well because it doesn't actually

11623.279 --> 11629.359
help their

11625.52 --> 11632.76
power because it solves the issue and

11629.359 --> 11636.56
when the issue is solved you lose your

11632.76 --> 11639.399
power so yeah yeah that's that's why

11636.56 --> 11641.519999999999
Marxism only makes more problems because

11639.399 --> 11644.399
if there's more problems well then you

11641.52 --> 11646.720000000001
need them more to supposedly solve their

11644.399 --> 11648.68
those problems even though they're only

11646.72 --> 11651.358999999999
there to make problems worse so that

11648.68 --> 11651.359
they get more

11653.56 --> 11658.92
power yeah actual environmentalism yeah

11656.399 --> 11660.08
do plant to tree it's good that's

11658.92 --> 11662.6
actually

11660.08 --> 11666.479
helpful it's good for everything

11662.6 --> 11670.2
especially nature just do that yeah just

11666.479 --> 11674.438999999998
go back to the basic basic

11670.2 --> 11677.52
environmentalism and remove Marxist

11674.439 --> 11680.399
environmentalism remove the scammers the

11677.52 --> 11683.560000000001
Power Players the ones that

11680.399 --> 11689.039999999999
create environmental

11683.56 --> 11689.039999999999
calamities to enforce their own power

11695.76 --> 11702.12
yeah I want the restoration of real

11699.88 --> 11706.199999999999
environmentalism and in order to achieve

11702.12 --> 11706.2
that we need to remove the

11706.479 --> 11712.599999999999
marxists we need to stop the climate

11709.239 --> 11714.84
change satanic cult and with satanic

11712.6 --> 11718.16
doesn't mean a bunch of stupid rituals

11714.84 --> 11720.6
and gross [ __ ] with and everything

11718.16 --> 11723.359
although that's undoubtedly involved too

11720.6 --> 11726.04
what it's not really relevant no I call

11723.359 --> 11730.56
it Satanic because everything they do is

11726.04 --> 11734.319000000001
reversed world all the problems they see

11730.56 --> 11736.08
don't exist until they create those

11734.319 --> 11738.8
problems as a

11736.08 --> 11740.84
solution to the supposed problems that

11738.8 --> 11743.08
they claimed were

11740.84 --> 11745.399
there that's how they are satanic

11743.08 --> 11747.479
they're reversed World environmentalist

11745.399 --> 11749.198999999999
and they only create more

11747.479 --> 11752.438999999998
environmentalist

11749.199 --> 11755.16
problems just to get more power that's

11752.439 --> 11758.439
their Marxist

11755.16 --> 11763.52
game that's what they're doing they're

11758.439 --> 11763.52
not environmentalists they're satanists

11782.239 --> 11787.84
okay stepen Jaris I have the best

11784.92 --> 11791.239
Channel always different yeah well I am

11787.84 --> 11791.239
very passionate about this

11792.84 --> 11799.399
subject I was really hurt like when I

11796.239 --> 11802.72
figured out that environmentalism was a

11799.399 --> 11805.68
scam like I got personally hurt

11802.72 --> 11807.96
I I was like so hurt by it that I

11805.68 --> 11810.800000000001
actually felt like [ __ ] killing those

11807.96 --> 11814.919999999998
people those fake and like killing

11810.8 --> 11816.56
them like they were like on their stage

11814.92 --> 11818.88
and then me like walking up and

11816.56 --> 11821.64
literally like taking a really big knife

11818.88 --> 11824.358999999999
and just slash their [ __ ] head off in

11821.64 --> 11826.76
one cut like right on camera right

11824.359 --> 11830.04
during their [ __ ] press conferences

11826.76 --> 11833.84
yeah that's what I was thinking

11830.04 --> 11836.92
about like 20 years ago about doing when

11833.84 --> 11840.239
I found out that they're there to

11836.92 --> 11843.479
destroy nature like kill

11840.239 --> 11846.239
them cuz I am actually an environment I

11843.479 --> 11849.96
an environmentalist extremist in that

11846.239 --> 11851.92
sense like people that abuse

11849.96 --> 11854.358999999999
environmentalism for power and then

11851.92 --> 11857.960000000001
actually create environmentalist

11854.359 --> 11861.640000000001
problems like that in my opinion they

11857.96 --> 11861.64
should die for

11863.0 --> 11868.76
that it's not even like tra tra

11866.239 --> 11872.319
treachery to a nation it's a treachery

11868.76 --> 11875.319
to Nature I mean it is an Abomination

11872.319 --> 11880.319
that I unimaginable to

11875.319 --> 11880.319
me that people would do that

11904.56 --> 11907.84
right and we need to stop

11920.359 --> 11925.479000000001
them cuz yeah

11923.0 --> 11928.479
they're they've had their

11925.479 --> 11930.319
power they're losing mind control Power

11928.479 --> 11932.16
people are starting to see their satanic

11930.319 --> 11934.88
and reversed world and now they're going

11932.16 --> 11937.84
to try to churn down on

11934.88 --> 11940.759999999998
Humanity eat us up right that's what

11937.84 --> 11943.08
Satanism is always for it's always they

11940.76 --> 11947.319
start with something revers it inside

11943.08 --> 11949.319
out but the only eventual goal is the

11947.319 --> 11952.479
consuming and

11949.319 --> 11954.039999999999
destruction of humanity itself that's

11952.479 --> 11955.519999999999
what they always end up doing and that's

11954.04 --> 11959.960000000001
what they're doing right now and we

11955.52 --> 11959.960000000001
better stop them or we're all going to

11960.239 --> 11966.56
die cuz that is the end goal to the

11963.84 --> 11966.56
satanic

11982.239 --> 11987.16
environmentalist right so yeah it's not

11984.279 --> 11989.199
much about the voluntary big farm

11987.16 --> 11991.88
thing in the exemption more about

11989.199 --> 11995.960000000001
environmentalism today but I guess

11991.88 --> 11995.96
that it's just the way it

11998.08 --> 12003.279
is now it's not a gripe with government

12001.12 --> 12004.52
stepen je has nothing to do with it it

12003.279 --> 12008.16
has to

12004.52 --> 12010.279
do with satanic environmentalism as a

12008.16 --> 12013.64
concept and people that are getting

12010.279 --> 12015.84
recruited into it as cultists they don't

12013.64 --> 12017.84
understand what they're talking about

12015.84 --> 12019.68
they don't understand environmentalism

12017.84 --> 12023.56
itself they have

12019.68 --> 12026.08
no good guidelines and they're overly

12023.56 --> 12030.479
trusting in systems that are obviously

12026.08 --> 12030.479
lying to them and are antihuman and

12032.359 --> 12038.76
evil yeah it's nothing to do with

12036.199 --> 12043.08
government it's what kind of people are

12038.76 --> 12047.72
you allowing to take seat in the

12043.08 --> 12047.72
government that's what it's about

12063.96 --> 12066.96
w

12072.93 --> 12076.079

12080.39 --> 12083.619999999999
[Applause]

12091.319 --> 12096.96

12093.96 --> 12096.96
awesome

12100.479 --> 12104.599999999999
wow

12102.239 --> 12106.72
yeah so I'm putting it in there

12104.6 --> 12108.52
mandatory big farm I wouldn't have been

12106.72 --> 12114.319
exempt cut it

12108.52 --> 12114.319000000001
down to make it fit and satanic

12114.96 --> 12119.319
environmentalism was definitely worth

12117.08 --> 12119.319
the

12124.16 --> 12127.16
mention

12132.76 --> 12138.52
yeah so it's in there borders boy yeah

12138.88 --> 12145.72
and yeah it is a subject that I it's not

12141.56 --> 12145.72
the first time that I brought it up

12146.08 --> 12151.039999999999
yeah cuz everybody now thinks

12149.199 --> 12152.6
environmentalism oh they're all it's

12151.04 --> 12154.640000000001
evil environmental is evil

12152.6 --> 12159.04
environmentalism is anti-christian and

12154.64 --> 12161.0
I'm like [ __ ] you [ __ ] it all like

12159.04 --> 12164.080000000002
they've taken environment

12161.0 --> 12166.56
environmentalism is a good thing

12164.08 --> 12170.96
environmentalism is like common sense

12166.56 --> 12173.6
that little children totally understand

12170.96 --> 12176.239
naturally like little kids that are like

12173.6 --> 12178.12
five or six will be like yeah of course

12176.239 --> 12182.039999999999
we have to help nature and then nature

12178.12 --> 12184.439
helps us like it's just common sense

12182.04 --> 12187.92
people it's so common

12184.439 --> 12192.16
sense right and look at what they've

12187.92 --> 12194.92
done with it they weaponized it they

12192.16 --> 12197.6
they made it into like stupid Financial

12194.92 --> 12200.199
Ponzi scheme

12197.6 --> 12203.0
and now everything is inside out and

12200.199 --> 12205.960000000001
it's it's just like oh we have to cut

12203.0 --> 12207.72
down on humans and human activity

12205.96 --> 12210.519999999999
because it's bad for the environment

12207.72 --> 12213.64
when it provably

12210.52 --> 12216.12
isn't and where where it is achieved

12213.64 --> 12219.56
environment doesn't improve it's not

12216.12 --> 12224.92
improving because of these

12219.56 --> 12228.278999999999
policies it is it's it's provably not

12224.92 --> 12230.359
improving it's doing the opposite cuz

12228.279 --> 12233.560000000001
the whole thing is satanic it's not

12230.359 --> 12236.399000000001
environmentalism it's the exact

12233.56 --> 12238.72
opposite and I want the original

12236.399 --> 12240.119999999999
environmentalism which is a good thing I

12238.72 --> 12243.278999999999
want it to be

12240.12 --> 12245.960000000001
restored I want people to think of that

12243.279 --> 12249.92
as being a good thing

12245.96 --> 12253.599999999999
again it's good to conserve nature it's

12249.92 --> 12258.439
good to find the balance with nature

12253.6 --> 12260.720000000001
it's good to minimize actual pollution

12258.439 --> 12264.04
what is pollution pollution is things

12260.72 --> 12265.92
that literally Make nature die yeah

12264.04 --> 12270.439
that's how it's

12265.92 --> 12273.439
defined it makes it die now oh with

12270.439 --> 12276.52
some oh climate change everything just

12273.439 --> 12280.08
changes because of something no not

12276.52 --> 12283.52
change death acute death

12280.08 --> 12286.68
pollution acute death like oh something

12283.52 --> 12289.04
is happening oh all the life is dying

12286.68 --> 12291.960000000001
why would it be dying because of

12289.04 --> 12294.52
pollution that's what pollution does it

12291.96 --> 12297.399
acutely makes everything die by

12294.52 --> 12300.239
poisoning it that's

12297.399 --> 12303.039999999999
pollution yeah not oh everything is

12300.239 --> 12305.6
going to change like no that's not

12303.04 --> 12310.399000000001
pollution that's some hor [ __ ] that's

12305.6 --> 12313.52
made up pollution is Poison Poison kills

12310.399 --> 12317.479
life we don't want that we don't want

12313.52 --> 12319.560000000001
pollution we want environmentally

12317.479 --> 12322.358999999999
friendly

12319.56 --> 12326.08
substances that don't kill

12322.359 --> 12329.16
life cuz that's better for us humans

12326.08 --> 12330.76
being live alive living things yeah we

12329.16 --> 12332.92
don't want pollution because that's bad

12330.76 --> 12335.12
for us and it won't don't we don't want

12332.92 --> 12338.319
pollution for nature because it's bad

12335.12 --> 12341.84
for nature and we need nature we need

12338.319 --> 12344.6
nature for our food for our

12341.84 --> 12347.199
air for our

12344.6 --> 12349.399000000001
mental stability

12347.199 --> 12351.52
for our mental restoration we need

12349.399 --> 12354.519999999999
nature just to like be able to walk

12351.52 --> 12358.319000000001
around and feel human again after

12354.52 --> 12364.0
sitting on the internet all the time

12358.319 --> 12364.0
right Environ basic environmentalism is

12364.88 --> 12372.519999999999
good climate change cultism is not

12368.16 --> 12372.52
environmentalism it's satanic

12380.319 --> 12385.319
SOC environmentalists are just rent them

12382.88 --> 12390.0
mom

12385.319 --> 12393.68
yeah well they're activist mercenaries

12390.0 --> 12397.0
Stephen Jarvis yeah that's a thing it's

12393.68 --> 12399.279
just like antifa they're

12397.0 --> 12403.56
activist

12399.279 --> 12406.960000000001
mercenaries activism is their

12403.56 --> 12409.319
job mercenary indicates that they'll

12406.96 --> 12413.08
just do it for money as long as they get

12409.319 --> 12415.76
paid they will commence in activism and

12413.08 --> 12420.0
everything that comes with it

12415.76 --> 12421.64
political mostly political but it's paid

12420.0 --> 12423.84
they do it professionally that's why

12421.64 --> 12427.319
they're mercenaries

12423.84 --> 12429.84
yeah mercenary

12427.319 --> 12432.6
activism it's actually a good word that

12429.84 --> 12434.6
should be added to the list here next to

12432.6 --> 12436.960000000001
en satanic environmentalism but there is

12434.6 --> 12439.720000000001
not just no more room

12436.96 --> 12442.119999999999
but it is the way that you should see it

12439.72 --> 12445.96
these antifa people and all that [ __ ]

12442.12 --> 12449.92
and Greta thundor too I mean she is not

12445.96 --> 12452.96
just an activist she's a mercenary

12449.92 --> 12457.52
activist they do it because there's

12452.96 --> 12460.519999999999
money they get paid they get the

12457.52 --> 12460.52
deals

12461.12 --> 12465.0
yeah real

12463.08 --> 12467.56
environmentalists they don't do it for

12465.0 --> 12469.52
the money they're often pour a [ __ ] they

12467.56 --> 12472.16
do it for their region they do it for

12469.52 --> 12474.92
their spot they do it because they love

12472.16 --> 12477.8
the beauty of the nature Etc yeah they

12474.92 --> 12477.8
don't make

12478.399 --> 12482.479
Deals they they get into trouble with

12481.0 --> 12484.68
the police because they don't and

12482.479 --> 12486.92
they're just like trying to stop

12484.68 --> 12491.399
corporations from killing nature from

12486.92 --> 12494.399
cutting down some place right that's

12491.399 --> 12497.8
activism these climate change activists

12494.399 --> 12502.08
aren't activists they're mercenaries

12497.8 --> 12506.56
they're doing it for the

12502.08 --> 12506.56
money they're mercenary

12518.239 --> 12522.96
activists right anyway I'm going to

12521.279 --> 12527.560000000001
maneuver towards rounding out the show

12522.96 --> 12527.56
it's been very intense very

12527.64 --> 12532.599999999999
very

12529.479 --> 12534.479
fluid very few silent pauses and so it's

12532.6 --> 12536.359
been a good show way better than

12534.479 --> 12540.039999999999
yesterday because yesterday I watched it

12536.359 --> 12540.04
back and it was just a whole bunch of

12541.239 --> 12546.76
like nothing yesterday's show was [ __ ]

12545.319 --> 12548.278999999999
I'm I'm just going to say it yesterday's

12546.76 --> 12551.04
show was

12548.279 --> 12553.880000000001
[ __ ] and it's not even because I was

12551.04 --> 12557.0
terrible it's just that nothing happened

12553.88 --> 12560.399
didn't have a point I wasn't

12557.0 --> 12562.16
fluid I still had issues like remnants

12560.399 --> 12564.599999999999
from the headache that I had the day

12562.16 --> 12566.52
before cuz the headache I had the day

12564.6 --> 12570.16
before

12566.52 --> 12571.720000000001
yesterday the third it was terrible like

12570.16 --> 12574.439
a really bad

12571.72 --> 12575.16
headache felt like oh my God like I got

12574.439 --> 12578.279
a

12575.16 --> 12580.16
flu like that level headache it did go

12578.279 --> 12583.08
away though it it

12580.16 --> 12586.359
did I didn't have the flu apparently but

12583.08 --> 12590.88
I did have a headache like I did and and

12586.359 --> 12590.880000000001
it just like disabled me

12591.04 --> 12597.76
from performing adequately yesterday and

12595.359 --> 12599.720000000001
today I do not have that issue today I

12597.76 --> 12602.84
am in a mood where I just don't shut the

12599.72 --> 12604.96
[ __ ] up ever right but hey I have a live

12602.84 --> 12606.68
show so I shouldn't be able to I

12604.96 --> 12608.599999999999
shouldn't be shutting the [ __ ] up I

12606.68 --> 12611.479000000001
should be never ending

12608.6 --> 12613.56
blabbering and I am and I'm blabbering

12611.479 --> 12616.198999999999
with a point I'm making a case I'm

12613.56 --> 12620.76
putting down good ideas I'm putting down

12616.199 --> 12623.52
good words durable words for the

12620.76 --> 12626.76
future durable words that we should

12623.52 --> 12628.560000000001
carry with us and use and reapply

12626.76 --> 12630.72
because the words in the way they're

12628.56 --> 12633.76
described like satanic

12630.72 --> 12638.239
environmentalism merary activist these

12633.76 --> 12640.880000000001
are key words that really will resonate

12638.239 --> 12644.359
and clarify what's going on to the

12640.88 --> 12647.64
people that use them and hear them use

12644.359 --> 12647.640000000001
these words

12655.68 --> 12662.0
right

12657.92 --> 12666.16
but even to every good show there must

12662.0 --> 12667.399
come an end and uh been going for three
