it coming guys

99.6 --> 103.759
right so yeah the weather today is

102.24 --> 106.32
turned around

103.759 --> 106.32
quite a bit

107.6 --> 113.19999999999999
it started to get

110.56 --> 115.68
stormy and clouded last night it was

113.2 --> 118.799
really spectacular actually

115.68 --> 121.28
because it was almost like non-stop

118.799 --> 123.52000000000001
lightning storming

121.28 --> 125.28
after

123.52 --> 128.07999999999998
like two o'clock

125.28 --> 131.119
it started in the distance and was like

128.08 --> 131.119
a lot of lightning

133.44 --> 138.72
and kept up until about like five

135.92 --> 142.48
o'clock roughly

138.72 --> 145.35999999999999
kept me up a bit

142.48 --> 146.07999999999998
and now it's cooled down a bit to i

145.36 --> 149.36
think

146.08 --> 152.8
is it 21 24 degrees

149.36 --> 152.8
which is still really warm

154.4 --> 158.4
but yeah no more direct sun heat

160.239 --> 164.04
and a lot of moisture

170.0 --> 173.28
me check the temperature

174.08 --> 179.12
23 degrees even right 80 percent

177.2 --> 183.159
precipitation

179.12 --> 183.159
65 humidity

185.76 --> 188.07999999999998
right

189.84 --> 195.68
hello psych bear first in chat clap

192.319 --> 195.67999999999998
ruckus good to see you

197.599 --> 201.599
yeah it is a bit brewy

202.8 --> 205.28
foggy

206.319 --> 209.95899999999997
foggy in the morning

212.48 --> 218.72
oh you know fog it's good fog is moist

216.35 --> 221.599
[Music]

218.72 --> 224.33
fog in the morning sun in the afternoon

221.599 --> 229.45999999999998
is a great combination

224.33 --> 229.46
[Music]

232.08 --> 234.4
right

236.0 --> 241.28
so yeah i feel pretty good actually

240.159 --> 242.239
like

241.28 --> 245.12
no

242.239 --> 248.56
tension issues whatsoever even like

245.12 --> 250.799
whatsoever which is unexpected

248.56 --> 254.64000000000001
did go to bed kind of late

250.799 --> 257.519
i did not eat all that much

254.64 --> 260.88
kind of like yesterday or the i mean two

257.519 --> 262.72
days ago and the day before that even

260.88 --> 264.56
i just didn't eat much

262.72 --> 267.28000000000003
i think that probably today the way i'm

264.56 --> 269.12
feeling i'm gonna eat some more

267.28 --> 271.19899999999996
but i feel like

269.12 --> 272.4
kind of mellow

271.199 --> 273.44
like

272.4 --> 274.56
it's

273.44 --> 276.08
maybe

274.56 --> 280.16
maybe

276.08 --> 283.84
it's the heat and all the moist mine

280.16 --> 283.84000000000003
just makes me want to relax

290.479 --> 295.84
but anyhow feel pretty good

293.84 --> 297.67999999999995
yesterday show i haven't watched my own

295.84 --> 300.15999999999997
back

297.68 --> 301.68
i was getting really worked up again

300.16 --> 305.28000000000003
wasn't i

301.68 --> 305.28000000000003
i just get like that sometimes

306.08 --> 310.479
but uh

307.919 --> 314.08
yeah flat earth debate was great

310.479 --> 314.08
it was very interesting again

317.919 --> 322.08
there's been a lot of great

319.759 --> 324.47900000000004
letter debate shows recently i think

322.08 --> 326.71999999999997
that we're really like getting even

324.479 --> 329.12
better than before

326.72 --> 331.84000000000003
and i love that there's just a lot of

329.12 --> 335.52
meta analysis

331.84 --> 339.039
which i am very good at myself

335.52 --> 341.59999999999997
that's what i do a lot and yeah because

339.039 --> 344.24
of psychology doing that is very

341.6 --> 344.24
rewarding

344.72 --> 349.03900000000004
because you get to understand things

346.479 --> 351.36
better and like eventually even build

349.039 --> 354.24
patterns out of it just out of something

351.36 --> 356.56
and then figuring out where it's going

354.24 --> 360.72
just to a certain degree

356.56 --> 360.72
so yeah flat earth debate was great

365.039 --> 371.44
mr cheswick is live streaming for some

367.52 --> 371.44
reason right now i have no idea why

374.639 --> 378.919
strange time to do that

380.88 --> 387.039
right so i was watching some owen

382.56 --> 387.039
benjamin before this from thursday still

391.68 --> 394.8
yesterday

392.96 --> 396.88
jim bob was live

394.8 --> 398.8
i almost went on there but it didn't do

396.88 --> 401.039
it after all

398.8 --> 401.039
uh

403.039 --> 407.12
right

404.8 --> 409.28000000000003
also yeah

407.12 --> 410.96
since two days ago i didn't even mention

409.28 --> 414.63899999999995
it just there

410.96 --> 416.79999999999995
i got through the blake 7 series

414.639 --> 419.36
oh

416.8 --> 423.199
it was such a bummer man

419.36 --> 427.12
i mean that last episode was like

423.199 --> 428.24
was like a seed for a whole new season

427.12 --> 431.28000000000003
like

428.24 --> 433.039
blake came back he had a new

431.28 --> 434.23999999999995
story to him as to what had been

433.039 --> 436.56
happening

434.24 --> 439.84000000000003
and yeah everything was just changing

436.56 --> 442.479
around but it seems very apparent very

439.84 --> 442.479
blatantly

442.56 --> 448.96
all right say that

445.21 --> 452.4
[Music]

448.96 --> 454.88
seems logical or to me like what

452.4 --> 457.599
happened like they were gonna probably

454.88 --> 459.36
get a new season and then probably

457.599 --> 461.28
i don't know the ratings weren't all

459.36 --> 464.16
that high or

461.28 --> 465.44
issues probably ratings issues at the

464.16 --> 468.24
time

465.44 --> 470.319
and then it was just discontinued

468.24 --> 474.96000000000004
because that last season

470.319 --> 478.599
to be fair wasn't really all that great

474.96 --> 478.599
after they basically

478.879 --> 483.52000000000004
lose the liberator

480.56 --> 485.759
the new setting is just

483.52 --> 489.28
it's not the same thing like even though

485.759 --> 491.599
orac is still there and all that

489.28 --> 494.55999999999995
but yeah i thought i think that probably

491.599 --> 496.87899999999996
if they'd let the next season go on

494.56 --> 499.12
it would have been really good probably

496.879 --> 501.03900000000004
as good as season three but it was just

499.12 --> 502.879
blatantly discontinued in the last

501.039 --> 506.44
episode

502.879 --> 506.44
that's really tragic

506.479 --> 510.24
because it it just the potential was

508.4 --> 511.039
still there

510.24 --> 513.36
right

511.039 --> 516.159
so i'm kind of sad about that

513.36 --> 520.5600000000001
yesterday mostly and then in the evening

516.159 --> 524.24
i bumped into like this new series

520.56 --> 526.4799999999999
on netflix it's really hard to find

524.24 --> 528.72
anything got a netflix

526.48 --> 529.839
scroll all that garbage through all of

528.72 --> 532.48
it

529.839 --> 533.6800000000001
so disgusting most of it

532.48 --> 535.2
but

533.68 --> 538.0799999999999
yeah i found

535.2 --> 540.6400000000001
blood of zeus a

538.08 --> 540.64
anime

540.959 --> 546.88
greek mythology series so

545.04 --> 549.279
and it is

546.88 --> 551.04
it is

549.279 --> 555.04
intense

551.04 --> 555.04
holy [Â __Â ] is that intense

555.12 --> 560.24
but like it has great music like all

558.64 --> 562.64
classical

560.24 --> 563.36
instrumentation greek style

562.64 --> 566.3199999999999
all

563.36 --> 567.76
and it is really just like about the old

566.32 --> 569.7600000000001
greece

567.76 --> 572.959
and the mythology and there's like the

569.76 --> 575.36
pantheons just right there it is

572.959 --> 577.8389999999999
it is a greek mythology story about

575.36 --> 579.44
what is it again here on

577.839 --> 581.9200000000001
like another

579.44 --> 584.32
another

581.92 --> 586.0799999999999
half god

584.32 --> 587.9200000000001
from zeus

586.08 --> 589.519
because he's he'd been screwing around

587.92 --> 592.64
and even like

589.519 --> 593.839
well yeah the series is about that as

592.64 --> 596.48
well

593.839 --> 599.36
but yeah i'm like halfway and it is like

596.48 --> 601.279
developing like quite dramatically

599.36 --> 603.76
so i have no idea where it's going i

601.279 --> 604.8
don't know this story they also start

603.76 --> 606.8
out

604.8 --> 608.24
by saying like this is another one of

606.8 --> 610.079
those verbal

608.24 --> 612.16
tradition stories

610.079 --> 614.3199999999999
and i think that this one probably isn't

612.16 --> 616.3199999999999
talked about that much so i do think

614.32 --> 619.12
that it is still based on something that

616.32 --> 621.2
is like from ancient

619.12 --> 623.68
storytelling tradition because it is

621.2 --> 626.6400000000001
mythology although yeah

623.68 --> 626.64
what does that mean

629.04 --> 634.3199999999999
but it is intense and it's pretty gory

632.079 --> 634.3199999999999
too

638.56 --> 644.16
so yeah it's not for children at all is

641.44 --> 645.0400000000001
definitely 12 plus

644.16 --> 647.4399999999999
and

645.04 --> 649.04
but it is

647.44 --> 650.8000000000001
very impressive

649.04 --> 653.8389999999999
they have very little issues with it

650.8 --> 655.1999999999999
there's only one issue and that is like

653.839 --> 657.9200000000001
the main

655.2 --> 660.399
baddie who is literally like a demon's

657.92 --> 662.8
fawn

660.399 --> 664.72
or rather a guy transformed into it look

662.8 --> 666.8
they explained the entire lore of how

664.72 --> 667.76
everything works so i'm not going to do

666.8 --> 670.7199999999999
all that

667.76 --> 673.76
because i'm still watching it

670.72 --> 676.64
and i don't want to spoil too much

673.76 --> 679.68
but every time that guy comes into view

676.64 --> 681.36
they have to play like a special

679.68 --> 683.68
little sound effect

681.36 --> 684.9590000000001
and at first it's like oh

683.68 --> 687.3599999999999
but then

684.959 --> 689.68
like after the second or third episode

687.36 --> 691.6
it gets really freaking annoying it's

689.68 --> 694.079
getting on my nerves i'm like yeah i

691.6 --> 696.64
know it's him oh the stupid special boy

694.079 --> 698.8
sound effect now [Â __Â ] off i just want to

696.64 --> 701.36
enjoy the actual music that isn't that

698.8 --> 703.68
sound effect and watch the series don't

701.36 --> 706.64
keep doing that

703.68 --> 708.7199999999999
that was like the only point

706.64 --> 711.12
that i thought was annoying about it and

708.72 --> 713.6
the rest is like

711.12 --> 717.36
really impressive as in like

713.6 --> 719.9200000000001
really impressive

717.36 --> 722.24
very action

719.92 --> 722.24
very

722.88 --> 728.959
very mythological and like backgrounds

725.76 --> 731.519
and environments holy [Â __Â ] dude that

728.959 --> 734.16
surreal stuff too like that you get

731.519 --> 736.32
literally you get a look around in

734.16 --> 739.36
heaven and in hell

736.32 --> 741.2
and like the the rivers uh no wait not

739.36 --> 745.839
sticks

741.2 --> 745.839
the the one in in greek mythology

746.48 --> 751.519
tend to blend them all in

748.8 --> 753.5999999999999
right it is freaking incredible it

751.519 --> 755.12
reminded me of lord of the rings at

753.6 --> 756.88
times

755.12 --> 758.839
with like the style and just how

756.88 --> 762.56
impressive dude they show like this

758.839 --> 765.12
massive like robotic titan

762.56 --> 766.0
that is like 60 meters tall or something

765.12 --> 768.9590000000001
and then

766.0 --> 771.12
combat just what the [Â __Â ]

768.959 --> 775.04
like it reminded me of

771.12 --> 776.48
lord of the rings and of like the well

775.04 --> 779.76
the marvel

776.48 --> 781.9200000000001
superhero [Â __Â ] except it's all animated

779.76 --> 781.92
and

782.16 --> 788.079
it's not gross

784.959 --> 790.2399999999999
it's not modern and gross it is really

788.079 --> 793.12
like ancient the ancient

790.24 --> 794.48
more simple way and direct way of doing

793.12 --> 796.9590000000001
things and thinking

794.48 --> 796.9590000000001
it is

797.2 --> 803.6800000000001
very interesting

800.079 --> 805.1999999999999
and i definitely recommend any adult

803.68 --> 807.8389999999999
that like

805.2 --> 809.519
can handle or like likes to watch anime

807.839 --> 812.72
to watch that thing because it is

809.519 --> 812.72
extremely impressive

813.12 --> 816.16
so far

814.399 --> 819.279
keep you updated so i'm watching that

816.16 --> 823.12
bloody zeus they have every intro title

819.279 --> 823.12
card they like do it in another way

823.6 --> 829.6800000000001
so yeah overall there's been like a

825.92 --> 832.4799999999999
massive amount of attention put

829.68 --> 835.5999999999999
care and attention into this series

832.48 --> 835.6
so much detail

838.72 --> 843.0400000000001
so i'm very impressed so far i really

840.8 --> 846.16
had to like ah stop i have to stop

843.04 --> 848.079
watching i have to go to bed damn it

846.16 --> 851.959
otherwise i'd be still be watching like

848.079 --> 851.959
until six in the morning

857.199 --> 863.0999999999999
right so hello pjc net

860.48 --> 865.839
how are you doing

863.1 --> 869.5600000000001
[Music]

865.839 --> 869.5600000000001
hey mike's a doonich

871.8 --> 874.9799999999999
[Music]

879.76 --> 883.4399999999999
youtube is weird

881.76 --> 885.8389999999999
why are they like

883.44 --> 887.6
letting the chat start all

885.839 --> 891.36
at the bottom now

887.6 --> 891.36
with the stream it's so weird

893.44 --> 898.72
why did they choose to do that

896.24 --> 900.48
you know you're noticing

898.72 --> 905.279
right

900.48 --> 905.279
like how it all starts at the bottom

907.6 --> 910.839
it's weird

914.88 --> 919.079
oh okay we just seen it

927.199 --> 931.059
right

927.84 --> 931.0590000000001
[Music]

934.639 --> 940.48
it's really odd like how it can be so

937.12 --> 942.32
warm when it is so cloudy

940.48 --> 946.0790000000001
i guess it's just

942.32 --> 946.0790000000001
clouds are just trapping the heat

947.839 --> 952.8000000000001
and these clouds do kind of look like

950.48 --> 955.1990000000001
technically a thunderstorm that could

952.8 --> 958.4799999999999
just break out at some point again it

955.199 --> 958.4799999999999
really does look like that

959.279 --> 961.92
this is a

963.519 --> 969.519
a very big cloud pack i'd say over there

966.88 --> 972.079
it seems more hazy but over there that's

969.519 --> 972.079
pretty big

972.399 --> 976.48
looks like it reaches pretty high up

979.44 --> 984.0
so yeah it might actually say oh wait it

981.6 --> 986.48
is raining huh it's actually raining

984.0 --> 986.48
right now

987.279 --> 990.959
people walking with umbrella it's just

988.959 --> 993.959
not raining very hard

990.959 --> 993.959
anyhow

995.86 --> 999.059
[Music]

999.36 --> 1004.32
check always this way

1001.68 --> 1007.279
well sometimes all depends sometimes the

1004.32 --> 1008.8000000000001
chat goes rolling really fast

1007.279 --> 1010.8
other times

1008.8 --> 1013.199
people just like

1010.8 --> 1015.4399999999999
hang back and listen to me

1013.199 --> 1017.7589999999999
right especially when i'm not feeling

1015.44 --> 1020.399
overly dependent on the chat

1017.759 --> 1025.16
which a lot of the time i do

1020.399 --> 1025.16
but today i feel just so relaxed

1028.0 --> 1030.799
hey elise g

1037.439 --> 1040.72
maybe so that's weird

1040.0 --> 1044.799
my

1040.72 --> 1046.799
my roommate returned also the cute one

1044.799 --> 1050.4
i'm kind of happy to see her again

1046.799 --> 1050.4
she's been away for like two weeks

1051.2 --> 1056.16
that's just a roommate whatever i don't

1053.44 --> 1056.16
know i am

1056.72 --> 1066.409
enjoying her presence a lot of the time

1061.4 --> 1066.409
[Music]

1074.08 --> 1078.6789999999999
hey elise g how's the weather over there

1093.36 --> 1099.12
right guys like when you're coming here

1096.799 --> 1101.44
don't forget the rogens it up

1099.12 --> 1101.4399999999998
you know

1102.72 --> 1107.039
bit cloudy overcast ah okay so it's kind

1105.52 --> 1109.84
of the same you had the same type of

1107.039 --> 1109.84
weather as i had

1112.799 --> 1117.12
did i ever get the chance to bring a

1114.32 --> 1121.3999999999999
flatter to my roommate

1117.12 --> 1121.3999999999999
yeah i think i did that once

1123.36 --> 1128.8799999999999
i i'm not sure

1126.08 --> 1129.9189999999999
i will again but i i think i did bring

1128.88 --> 1132.96
it up

1129.919 --> 1135.2800000000002
and she seemed like yeah

1132.96 --> 1137.76
not that she was like oh

1135.28 --> 1139.84
or even like oh wow you flattered no

1137.76 --> 1141.76
it's just like i don't think she's she's

1139.84 --> 1144.1599999999999
like somebody that just thinks like

1141.76 --> 1146.48
that's a man thing

1144.16 --> 1147.8400000000001
i like that i kind of like that

1146.48 --> 1150.96
in a way

1147.84 --> 1152.6399999999999
but she did not have any

1150.96 --> 1154.64
like shock

1152.64 --> 1157.2
neurotic responses she seems like

1154.64 --> 1158.64
overall very

1157.2 --> 1161.6000000000001
deprogrammed

1158.64 --> 1164.5590000000002
like things propaganda and [Â __Â ]

1161.6 --> 1167.12
doesn't program her

1164.559 --> 1170.3999999999999
she's like very much herself she doesn't

1167.12 --> 1173.6789999999999
seem to be very influenceable

1170.4 --> 1178.799
by like media and gossip

1173.679 --> 1180.88
at all and i am really liking that

1178.799 --> 1183.52
i'm actually like

1180.88 --> 1183.5200000000002
relieved

1185.039 --> 1193.08
she just has this natural being herself

1189.039 --> 1193.08
thing all the time

1193.6 --> 1197.4399999999998
hello dj dj

1199.44 --> 1203.8400000000001
i don't have any stomach pains today

1202.24 --> 1206.64
yeah

1203.84 --> 1209.28
i know it's all very shocking to you

1206.64 --> 1211.8400000000001
to a lot of you because you're all

1209.28 --> 1213.52
medical inept

1211.84 --> 1215.12
and you think that any kind of pain is

1213.52 --> 1218.0
like oh my god i have to go to the

1215.12 --> 1220.6399999999999
doctor yeah no no you don't

1218.0 --> 1223.919
only wessies do

1220.64 --> 1225.76
and i wouldn't recommend it right now

1223.919 --> 1226.72
overall doesn't really matter where you

1225.76 --> 1229.84
are

1226.72 --> 1232.88
right but the stomach issue

1229.84 --> 1236.0
was actually yeah it's gonna sound a bit

1232.88 --> 1237.1200000000001
weird but it was a spirit thing i

1236.0 --> 1238.88
basically

1237.12 --> 1241.6789999999999
threw my empathy

1238.88 --> 1243.2800000000002
contracted ptsd

1241.679 --> 1244.64
ghosts

1243.28 --> 1247.44
from a guy

1244.64 --> 1248.5590000000002
that i met on saturday in

1247.44 --> 1251.679
church

1248.559 --> 1253.44
that was engaging me and i tried to dig

1251.679 --> 1257.2800000000002
really deep with him and i think i might

1253.44 --> 1260.64
have dug a little bit too deep too fast

1257.28 --> 1263.44
and when that happens sometimes

1260.64 --> 1265.679
like ptsd triggers

1263.44 --> 1268.159
inside he kept it all inside but that

1265.679 --> 1272.0
doesn't matter because i'm an empath so

1268.159 --> 1273.44
i caught some of that it was very likely

1272.0 --> 1274.24
the cause

1273.44 --> 1276.0800000000002
of

1274.24 --> 1279.039
lower it's not stomach it's lower

1276.08 --> 1280.799
intestine issues not my stomach see

1279.039 --> 1282.48
i don't really have a lot of stomach

1280.799 --> 1284.48
issues anymore

1282.48 --> 1288.0
take good care of it

1284.48 --> 1288.0
so it's much lower

1289.52 --> 1294.72
it has to do probably with the nerve

1291.919 --> 1297.039
centers that are typically present there

1294.72 --> 1300.08
so you could associate it with certain

1297.039 --> 1300.08
chakra regions

1301.039 --> 1303.28
right

1303.52 --> 1307.76
mainly the orange one in this case

1310.32 --> 1315.52
and yeah when my healer

1313.52 --> 1319.84
or when i called my healer

1315.52 --> 1319.84
a few days later was it um

1319.919 --> 1325.76
the monday after

1322.4 --> 1328.5590000000002
he basically confirmed that

1325.76 --> 1332.72
and took took care of it and

1328.559 --> 1335.6
yeah after that it just very quickly

1332.72 --> 1338.24
become much less much much more again

1335.6 --> 1340.1589999999999
like the original standard stage fright

1338.24 --> 1342.0
effect which isn't really all that much

1340.159 --> 1342.72
of a burden i can easily get through

1342.0 --> 1344.159
that

1342.72 --> 1346.0
right

1344.159 --> 1347.2
but with that action with the extra

1346.0 --> 1350.0
ghosts

1347.2 --> 1351.679
on top of that burdening me with things

1350.0 --> 1354.4
that aren't even mine

1351.679 --> 1357.76
it became like actual pain

1354.4 --> 1359.98
so that is what actually happened i know

1357.76 --> 1363.14
something else isn't it

1359.98 --> 1363.14
[Music]

1366.159 --> 1368.64
all right i'm calling them ghosts

1367.679 --> 1370.96
because

1368.64 --> 1373.3600000000001
yeah it is it's like but it is within

1370.96 --> 1375.2
spirit mechanics it's it's like micro

1373.36 --> 1377.76
possession except it's not possession

1375.2 --> 1382.48
like oh i'm taking him over it's just

1377.76 --> 1384.72
it's gonna sit somewhere and be a burden

1382.48 --> 1387.28
right

1384.72 --> 1389.6000000000001
that is the type of ghost and you can

1387.28 --> 1393.039
contract them from others

1389.6 --> 1395.28
right person that is completely unstable

1393.039 --> 1397.12
and irresponsible and out of control

1395.28 --> 1399.039
they're gonna ooze that sort of they're

1397.12 --> 1401.039
gonna ooze their demons you could call

1399.039 --> 1404.4
it a demon but it is technically not a

1401.039 --> 1404.4
demon because demons are

1407.28 --> 1412.32
not that

1409.12 --> 1414.84
demons are mostly like in behavior

1412.32 --> 1419.28
so it's more like a spirit but since

1414.84 --> 1423.52
it's somebody else's i call it a ghost

1419.28 --> 1423.52
i know it might be a little confusing

1424.88 --> 1429.159
uh hey tony whitcomb

1430.159 --> 1432.96
george sanford

1435.84 --> 1441.12
when i just played the other day

1438.24 --> 1443.44
i hope it's gone yeah yeah it is

1441.12 --> 1446.1589999999999
energy vampires

1443.44 --> 1448.48
yeah but energy vampires is complicated

1446.159 --> 1448.48
because

1448.72 --> 1453.919
in those spirits could be considered

1451.039 --> 1455.76
energy vampires but energy vampires can

1453.919 --> 1458.0
also be human

1455.76 --> 1460.559
a human can be an energy vampire but

1458.0 --> 1462.64
then you could definitely consider that

1460.559 --> 1465.039
they are like that because they have

1462.64 --> 1467.279
those spirits in them basically using

1465.039 --> 1467.279
them

1467.36 --> 1470.0
to do that

1471.6 --> 1473.84
right

1474.08 --> 1478.559
people carry spirits around with them

1478.72 --> 1481.84
it's like

1479.84 --> 1484.3999999999999
think of it as like the bacterial

1481.84 --> 1486.799
ecology almost right you're full of

1484.4 --> 1488.799
bacteria they are literally

1486.799 --> 1490.8799999999999
workers in your body

1488.799 --> 1494.6399999999999
or yeah almost like citizens in a

1490.88 --> 1496.159
society with a function

1494.64 --> 1498.96
well

1496.159 --> 1501.44
there's that as well with spirits

1498.96 --> 1503.8400000000001
up to a certain degree

1501.44 --> 1505.919
and there's like parasites and there's

1503.84 --> 1507.039
like symbiotes

1505.919 --> 1510.0
sort of

1507.039 --> 1510.0
but yeah that's

1512.08 --> 1517.039
that's right pgcnet so that was the

1515.52 --> 1520.0
cause

1517.039 --> 1522.48
i'm very certain of it i'm i was rather

1520.0 --> 1525.52
surprised that i hadn't picked up on it

1522.48 --> 1528.0
but it was my enthusiasm i think i got a

1525.52 --> 1530.1589999999999
little over enthusiastic

1528.0 --> 1532.32
which by the way shows in the show that

1530.159 --> 1533.8400000000001
i did after

1532.32 --> 1536.96
i had that meeting

1533.84 --> 1536.9599999999998
that was on saturday

1537.0 --> 1543.32
[Music]

1540.0 --> 1543.32
last saturday

1545.2 --> 1548.2
right

1561.039 --> 1564.76
hey daniel robles

1576.4 --> 1579.4
right

1588.48 --> 1590.72
so

1590.96 --> 1595.2
yeah thanks for bringing that up i know

1593.279 --> 1596.799
some anti-flat earth is out there that

1595.2 --> 1600.0
are like oh

1596.799 --> 1602.08
let's chant all his physical problems

1600.0 --> 1604.4
they are literally trying to curse me

1602.08 --> 1606.0
and doesn't work it doesn't work you

1604.4 --> 1608.0800000000002
dumbass

1606.0 --> 1610.96
it really doesn't work why do you think

1608.08 --> 1613.4399999999998
i am so open i'm not open

1610.96 --> 1617.1200000000001
about my personal

1613.44 --> 1620.88
you medical adjacent issues

1617.12 --> 1623.1999999999998
because oh no oh i said it oops no no

1620.88 --> 1625.0390000000002
i'm actually sharing it with you you

1623.2 --> 1629.76
[Â __Â ] idiots

1625.039 --> 1629.76
you think you can use that against me

1629.919 --> 1636.7990000000002
you can manipulate me with the things

1632.799 --> 1639.9189999999999
that i tell you you dumbass you think

1636.799 --> 1643.12
you could do that no no you can't i'm

1639.919 --> 1646.0800000000002
sharing it because i'm quite confident

1643.12 --> 1647.36
that you can't do that but keep trying

1646.08 --> 1650.36
by all means

1647.36 --> 1650.36
okay

1656.24 --> 1659.279
no borders boy

1667.44 --> 1672.0800000000002
has nothing to do with divination it has

1669.76 --> 1674.1589999999999
nothing to do with the card

1672.08 --> 1677.4399999999998
reading

1674.159 --> 1680.8400000000001
if anything the card reading that i did

1677.44 --> 1683.919
open up like a standard

1680.84 --> 1684.9599999999998
path which is kind of why i bumped into

1683.919 --> 1687.3600000000001
that guy

1684.96 --> 1690.24
the issue was is that i was too

1687.36 --> 1692.6399999999999
enthusiastic and basically

1690.24 --> 1694.48
almost like a girl in love or something

1692.64 --> 1696.7990000000002
through myself

1694.48 --> 1700.0
a little not like literally like that

1696.799 --> 1702.48
jesus but i basically opened myself up

1700.0 --> 1704.64
too much and was like oh yeah i'll take

1702.48 --> 1705.84
care of everything you got like an

1704.64 --> 1708.159
impulse

1705.84 --> 1711.36
right and that's the that was the

1708.159 --> 1713.1200000000001
problem that i was too open i was too

1711.36 --> 1714.799
empathical

1713.12 --> 1717.279
that was the cause

1714.799 --> 1719.2
not the card reading the card reading

1717.279 --> 1721.2
may have actually just like kind of

1719.2 --> 1724.559
opened a couple of doors

1721.2 --> 1726.72
good doors which enabled me to kind of

1724.559 --> 1728.6399999999999
make my spirit make contact with

1726.72 --> 1730.0
something else other than the internet

1728.64 --> 1731.279
again

1730.0 --> 1733.84
okay

1731.279 --> 1736.72
that was a good thing

1733.84 --> 1739.039
it's good to meet somebody new

1736.72 --> 1741.44
have a good conversation with them it's

1739.039 --> 1743.52
just not very good when i then open

1741.44 --> 1747.039
myself up too much

1743.52 --> 1749.039
and then start contracting ptsd

1747.039 --> 1753.08
spirits and [Â __Â ]

1749.039 --> 1753.08
that's the real problem

1758.72 --> 1765.279
what a weird oh yes oh it is so strange

1762.64 --> 1766.72
i mean nobody was thinking that or

1765.279 --> 1770.08
anything

1766.72 --> 1770.08
sock get out

1772.0 --> 1777.159
doesn't work

1773.36 --> 1777.1589999999999
doesn't work numb nuts

1801.919 --> 1806.24
what's

1802.96 --> 1808.96
my thoughts on global claims

1806.24 --> 1810.559
about the southern cross supposedly

1808.96 --> 1814.32
it's all nonsense

1810.559 --> 1816.48
it's all just presupposing the same [Â __Â ]

1814.32 --> 1818.96
daniel robles

1816.48 --> 1821.679
it's just like oh yeah yeah sure yeah i

1818.96 --> 1823.919
hit on your globe model

1821.679 --> 1825.2
that's what it would be

1823.919 --> 1828.8400000000001
sure it is

1825.2 --> 1828.8400000000001
it isn't though

1844.159 --> 1846.3990000000001
right

1845.36 --> 1849.12
i mean

1846.399 --> 1849.12
really it is

1849.279 --> 1855.2
it is like the celestial southpaw is it

1852.799 --> 1857.6
well why don't you actually go there

1855.2 --> 1859.519
then to antarctica

1857.6 --> 1861.279
and show it

1859.519 --> 1862.64
right overhead

1861.279 --> 1864.64
huh

1862.64 --> 1867.8400000000001
why don't you go do that

1864.64 --> 1867.8400000000001
show us how it is

1868.399 --> 1871.6789999999999
yeah it is the

1870.399 --> 1874.1589999999999
south pole

1871.679 --> 1877.1200000000001
show it right overhead

1874.159 --> 1878.48
never seen anything and anywhere close

1877.12 --> 1883.12
to that

1878.48 --> 1883.1200000000001
right southern cross is never too far

1883.519 --> 1886.559
above the horizon

1890.48 --> 1895.6
right so it's just a dumb ass claim

1893.12 --> 1898.7199999999998
that's all

1895.6 --> 1900.559
just making your presuppose

1898.72 --> 1902.64
but the earth is a sphere underneath the

1900.559 --> 1904.08
sphere of star so this is one side of

1902.64 --> 1905.679
that sphere of stars and this is the

1904.08 --> 1907.6789999999999
other and the earth is a ball underneath

1905.679 --> 1909.3600000000001
that's that's all they do that's all it

1907.679 --> 1911.6000000000001
is

1909.36 --> 1913.9189999999999
it's just making you dwell

1911.6 --> 1917.84
on the idea again of the earth being a

1913.919 --> 1917.8400000000001
ball and why it's so logical that's all

1918.64 --> 1921.96
hey akumaverse

1929.09 --> 1933.79
[Music]

1946.84 --> 1952.0
it

1948.799 --> 1955.6
the observations explain it explain the

1952.0 --> 1958.799
observations yeah yeah you move south

1955.6 --> 1960.559
then the celestial demisphere

1958.799 --> 1962.8799999999999
you could think of as a complete sphere

1960.559 --> 1964.72
but you only get to see half at any

1962.88 --> 1967.1200000000001
point

1964.72 --> 1969.2
yeah it starts rotating

1967.12 --> 1969.9899999999998
right it starts rotating and then oh you

1969.2 --> 1973.1200000000001
see

1969.99 --> 1974.559
[Music]

1973.12 --> 1977.279
the other point

1974.559 --> 1979.039
of apparent rotation

1977.279 --> 1981.919
the southern cross yeah you see the

1979.039 --> 1983.919
southern cross what what does that mean

1981.919 --> 1987.039
it means

1983.919 --> 1989.44
the celestials are a sphere

1987.039 --> 1991.44
and it rotates yeah

1989.44 --> 1993.6000000000001
not the globe though

1991.44 --> 1995.6000000000001
right not the globe earth which is in

1993.6 --> 1998.48
the globe

1995.6 --> 2000.799
that's right it's a celestial spinning

1998.48 --> 2002.0
sphere

2000.799 --> 2005.76
through

2002.0 --> 2007.519
onto projected holographically over

2005.76 --> 2008.72
a flat plane

2007.519 --> 2012.08
that's right

2008.72 --> 2012.08
that's how you explain that

2013.279 --> 2019.84
earth is not a ball

2016.32 --> 2019.84
underneath that all

2022.32 --> 2025.32
right

2036.07 --> 2040.799
[Music]

2038.48 --> 2042.96
oh different directions

2040.799 --> 2046.8799999999999
based on what what's your evidence that

2042.96 --> 2049.76
they're looking in different directions

2046.88 --> 2049.76
what's your evidence

2050.56 --> 2054.879
what's your evidence they're looking in

2051.919 --> 2056.839
different directions

2054.879 --> 2059.359
or are you

2056.839 --> 2061.44
automatically assuming

2059.359 --> 2064.96
that oh if the earth isn't a ball then

2061.44 --> 2068.639
it has to be a disk a literal euclidean

2064.96 --> 2071.679
disk no no it isn't

2068.639 --> 2074.56
the south is the south it's not in all

2071.679 --> 2078.079
directions the north is not a point a

2074.56 --> 2078.0789999999997
center point in a disk

2078.159 --> 2083.679
north is the north the south is the

2079.919 --> 2085.5989999999997
south i think north and south

2083.679 --> 2087.52
directions

2085.599 --> 2089.679
not magnetic one i guess but the

2087.52 --> 2092.56
celestial north and south directions i

2089.679 --> 2094.639
think that they are all parallel

2092.56 --> 2096.24
in euclidean space

2094.639 --> 2098.0
that's what i think

2096.24 --> 2100.3199999999997
understand

2098.0 --> 2103.04
north and south

2100.32 --> 2105.839
in euclidean space

2103.04 --> 2108.16
is all parallel not the magnetic one the

2105.839 --> 2111.04
celestial one

2108.16 --> 2111.04
that's what i think

2111.92 --> 2116.56
so yeah you don't have an ice wall

2113.92 --> 2118.88
surrounding you that's right

2116.56 --> 2119.839
you're encapsulated

2118.88 --> 2123.359
in a

2119.839 --> 2128.0789999999997
well rectangular looping system

2123.359 --> 2128.0789999999997
with an ice wall on one side

2129.359 --> 2132.16
very likely

2132.8 --> 2135.92
that's my suspicion

2137.44 --> 2144.96
that's where yeah because that fits the

2139.68 --> 2147.839
best in all ways it's celestial wise

2144.96 --> 2149.839
it's facial wise

2147.839 --> 2152.16
it reveals

2149.839 --> 2154.48
all these auctions which apparently

2152.16 --> 2155.92
already there like land beyond the south

2154.48 --> 2158.64
right

2155.92 --> 2160.96
or land beyond the north

2158.64 --> 2163.52
even on maps right well none of that

2160.96 --> 2165.359
actually makes any sense on a disk at

2163.52 --> 2168.0
all

2165.359 --> 2169.839
at all like not even close that's why

2168.0 --> 2172.88
disk flat earth

2169.839 --> 2175.7599999999998
is not it it's not a disk the flat earth

2172.88 --> 2175.76
is not a disk

2176.24 --> 2181.5989999999997
but it is kind of convenient

2179.2 --> 2184.3199999999997
to think of it as a disk as you're

2181.599 --> 2185.52
trying to explain to a baller how it's

2184.32 --> 2188.96
not a ball

2185.52 --> 2190.4
right it's a good first step towards

2188.96 --> 2192.7200000000003
flat earth

2190.4 --> 2195.44
it's not literal though

2192.72 --> 2199.8799999999997
the actual reality is a little bit more

2195.44 --> 2199.88
complicated and surreal

2206.4 --> 2209.4
what

2216.64 --> 2220.52
oh don't worry about that

2224.68 --> 2227.87
[Music]

2230.0 --> 2234.48
oh there is something concrete about fb

2232.079 --> 2236.6400000000003
absolutely that's not the word i used

2234.48 --> 2238.32
straw manning funny [Â __Â ] wit

2236.64 --> 2240.72
huh

2238.32 --> 2242.88
is this you roofy this you in the sock

2240.72 --> 2244.16
account or something

2242.88 --> 2246.8
huh

2244.16 --> 2249.7999999999997
yeah don't straw man me [Â __Â ]

2246.8 --> 2249.8
alright

2254.19 --> 2260.289
[Music]

2264.8 --> 2269.04
hey seeking star wars yeah we do have a

2266.72 --> 2273.16
derp today definitely

2269.04 --> 2273.16
derpcon 2 is a good assessment

2290.72 --> 2295.9199999999996
yeah okay hey what are you paying

2293.28 --> 2297.119
attention to then

2295.92 --> 2298.8
what

2297.119 --> 2301.28
you think you're paying attention to

2298.8 --> 2303.3590000000004
what are you paying attention to

2301.28 --> 2306.079
our claims are you paying attention to

2303.359 --> 2308.24
your straw man projection of how you

2306.079 --> 2311.6400000000003
want the flat earth to be

2308.24 --> 2311.64
unto us

2312.24 --> 2317.72
what are you paying attention to

2314.72 --> 2317.72
troll

2328.16 --> 2332.48
right like which which flat earth is

2330.24 --> 2336.0789999999997
because i do not share

2332.48 --> 2338.48
a variety of claims with a lot of flat

2336.079 --> 2340.4
earthers i mostly share

2338.48 --> 2343.2
the claims

2340.4 --> 2347.2000000000003
from the flat earth debate panel those

2343.2 --> 2347.2
are the claims that i like to defend

2347.92 --> 2352.4
right

2350.16 --> 2355.64
at least when it comes to physics

2352.4 --> 2355.64
and geometry

2365.04 --> 2369.599
okay getting inspector

2367.119 --> 2369.599
rig back

2370.079 --> 2374.32
that's your point what what is your

2371.839 --> 2376.16
point what your point is you don't like

2374.32 --> 2379.04
our source you just don't like flat

2376.16 --> 2381.5989999999997
earth debate because we're winning we're

2379.04 --> 2384.24
winning on every front

2381.599 --> 2385.119
every front

2384.24 --> 2387.1189999999997
yeah

2385.119 --> 2389.119
every single conceivable way

2387.119 --> 2391.6800000000003
psychological

2389.119 --> 2391.6800000000003
physical

2392.4 --> 2396.88
all of it

2394.0 --> 2399.76
every front we're winning we're winning

2396.88 --> 2403.2000000000003
so hard it is like becoming embarrassing

2399.76 --> 2407.2000000000003
to us how much we are winning

2403.2 --> 2409.5989999999997
over the globe tardia religion

2407.2 --> 2412.0
we're winning so hard there's literally

2409.599 --> 2415.04
like we are starting to actually feel

2412.0 --> 2417.52
like we're slave masters to unwilling

2415.04 --> 2419.92
slaves like which you are

2417.52 --> 2423.04
that we can just on a whim control

2419.92 --> 2426.319
because we utterly understand everything

2423.04 --> 2428.16
about you how you think why you think

2426.319 --> 2430.16
what drives you

2428.16 --> 2433.359
what you believe

2430.16 --> 2436.8799999999997
we're literally using you like mind

2433.359 --> 2439.2799999999997
control slaves openly

2436.88 --> 2440.6400000000003
and you could do something about it but

2439.28 --> 2444.1600000000003
you don't

2440.64 --> 2447.359
because you want to be that globe mind

2444.16 --> 2449.5989999999997
control slave you see

2447.359 --> 2453.64
so we're just

2449.599 --> 2453.6400000000003
giving you what you need

2486.319 --> 2489.599
wow yeah he is

2490.0 --> 2493.0
nonsense

2497.28 --> 2503.119
yeah gadget is fake i know

2500.8 --> 2506.44
anti-flag earth to see a lot of really

2503.119 --> 2506.44
weird things

2522.48 --> 2527.76
that's right ben white

2525.359 --> 2530.319
earth is

2527.76 --> 2532.4
very flat that is the geometric

2530.319 --> 2534.48
orientation of the earth's surface it's

2532.4 --> 2537.599
very flat

2534.48 --> 2543.119
the entire earth realm

2537.599 --> 2543.119
the volume available is very stationary

2543.359 --> 2549.2
and it is definitely contained because

2546.4 --> 2550.64
it is stable

2549.2 --> 2553.52
pressure is

2550.64 --> 2556.72
relatively stable despite the celestial

2553.52 --> 2560.48
light dynamic input which

2556.72 --> 2560.48
introduces heat fluctuation

2563.68 --> 2568.8799999999997
so yeah earth is flat stationary and

2566.4 --> 2568.88
contained

2569.599 --> 2575.04
it's the holy trinity of physics

2575.359 --> 2580.7999999999997
holy trinity of established fact about

2578.72 --> 2584.64
this realm

2580.8 --> 2584.6400000000003
flat stationary contain

2584.72 --> 2590.64
flat stationary contain that is

2588.0 --> 2591.599
those are the three things

2590.64 --> 2593.2
that

2591.599 --> 2595.839
yeah any

2593.2 --> 2598.0789999999997
it's like a like holding a cross to a

2595.839 --> 2600.7999999999997
vampire except

2598.079 --> 2603.3590000000004
this is the globe believer

2600.8 --> 2606.2400000000002
flat stationary contained

2603.359 --> 2608.88
israel facts all backed by physics

2606.24 --> 2610.56
natural law

2608.88 --> 2613.04
actual measurements

2610.56 --> 2616.0
logic geometry

2613.04 --> 2616.0
it's nothing you could do

2616.72 --> 2623.04
that is the reality yeah the globe model

2621.04 --> 2625.2799999999997
was comprised

2623.04 --> 2628.96
made up designed

2625.28 --> 2632.4
based off a flat plane

2628.96 --> 2635.2
in the celestial sphere

2632.4 --> 2638.7200000000003
you wouldn't have a globe model

2635.2 --> 2641.839
if the earth hadn't been flat

2638.72 --> 2643.04
so the ones that made the globe religion

2641.839 --> 2644.24
for you

2643.04 --> 2646.88
knew

2644.24 --> 2651.1189999999997
when they were making it that they were

2646.88 --> 2651.119
creating a lie to fool you

2652.56 --> 2659.92
you're so well willing

2656.4 --> 2661.2000000000003
like an addict to a science fiction

2659.92 --> 2663.76
novel

2661.2 --> 2665.4399999999996
that's just never ending

2663.76 --> 2667.119
you think it's never ending and you

2665.44 --> 2668.8
think that makes it real so you can

2667.119 --> 2670.88
escape therein

2668.8 --> 2673.28
versus the actual reality well it's not

2670.88 --> 2675.839
working though

2673.28 --> 2678.0
it's broken the novel's broken has been

2675.839 --> 2680.48
broken it's being abused there's writing

2678.0 --> 2683.52
teams put it being put on it that are

2680.48 --> 2685.2
making it disgusting and gross and

2683.52 --> 2688.16
corrupting and just

2685.2 --> 2691.359
using people's addiction to it

2688.16 --> 2693.44
to program the arrangement into them on

2691.359 --> 2695.5989999999997
purpose

2693.44 --> 2697.52
make them stupid make them more

2695.599 --> 2699.119
complacent

2697.52 --> 2702.7599999999998
that's what the globe religion now is

2699.119 --> 2702.76
being used for

2707.599 --> 2714.2000000000003
by a lot of factions anyway

2710.64 --> 2714.2
maybe not all

2850.64 --> 2855.359

why did you tell him that then

2857.2 --> 2863.2799999999997
or like write nathan an email i'm sure

2859.839 --> 2867.96
he's be you'd be very well willing to

review your email on the show

2903.599 --> 2908.92
yeah rick beck he's yeah i agree

2922.0 --> 2924.319
dude

2925.68 --> 2929.7999999999997
i mean stop it already

2930.079 --> 2934.04
just

2931.04 --> 2934.04
stop

2974.8 --> 2978.48
well bobby still i'm kind of trying to

2976.88 --> 2980.319
figure out like

2978.48 --> 2984.4
if i'm gonna ban this

2980.319 --> 2986.88
numb nuts in chat here

2984.4 --> 2986.88
is just

2989.2 --> 2993.7999999999997
being a

2990.8 --> 2993.8
numpty

3015.28 --> 3020.8
that's a terrible question

3018.559 --> 3026.0
so yeah you can't answer it just like

3020.8 --> 3028.319
gadget inspector said you can't numpty

3026.0 --> 3031.04
what you think you can answer his

3028.319 --> 3032.72
question with another question

3031.04 --> 3033.839
that makes you look smarter no it

3032.72 --> 3037.7999999999997
doesn't

3033.839 --> 3037.7999999999997
it's just a red herring

3040.079 --> 3044.96
dude okay i'm you're out of here you're

3042.0 --> 3047.359
spamming now just [Â __Â ] off

3044.96 --> 3047.359
bye

3048.16 --> 3055.02
no you're not you're [Â __Â ] up my chat

3051.83 --> 3055.02
[Music]

3062.96 --> 3068.96
interp alert yeah it was about four

3066.4 --> 3071.76
three or four but it's still just

3068.96 --> 3074.4
spamming right five now not five it

3071.76 --> 3076.96
wasn't like super gross

3074.4 --> 3081.559
at home attacks or anything it was just

3076.96 --> 3081.559
shaming so it was four at best

3082.72 --> 3088.8799999999997
it was fun yeah was fun while it lasted

3085.68 --> 3088.8799999999997
but just still

3089.119 --> 3094.4
too much distraction with nonsense i

3091.44 --> 3096.319
mean we don't really need to interact

3094.4 --> 3098.1600000000003
with one of these numpties anymore to

3096.319 --> 3099.04
predict exactly what they're going to do

3098.16 --> 3101.1189999999997
so

3099.04 --> 3103.04
at some point it is really just becoming

3101.119 --> 3106.4
a waste of time even like

3103.04 --> 3108.64
not instantly banning these numpties

3106.4 --> 3108.64
right

3108.8 --> 3112.7200000000003
and besides we already got a couple of

3111.119 --> 3115.599
more

3112.72 --> 3117.68
tamed numpties in chat

3115.599 --> 3120.28
that actually halfway know how to behave

3117.68 --> 3123.519
so

3120.28 --> 3123.5190000000002
[Music]

3132.4 --> 3136.559
imagine being too dumb to know you're no

3134.64 --> 3138.7999999999997
but that's not

3136.559 --> 3142.6400000000003
that's not a curse very back that's

3138.8 --> 3145.92
actually god's mercy

3142.64 --> 3148.5589999999997
that is the mercy that is inherent to

3145.92 --> 3148.559
that flaw

3148.96 --> 3151.68
if you're

3150.0 --> 3154.559
so dumb you don't know you're dumb

3151.68 --> 3154.5589999999997
that's a blessing

3157.839 --> 3162.68
i mean you're still gonna get everything

3159.28 --> 3162.6800000000003
wrong but

3182.48 --> 3186.16
yeah it is a pretty good question within

3185.2 --> 3187.68
the

3186.16 --> 3190.64
big bang

3187.68 --> 3193.04
conception which is complete horror [Â __Â ]

3190.64 --> 3195.1189999999997
but it isn't it it is an interesting

3193.04 --> 3197.44
thing to ponder on gadget inspector i

3195.119 --> 3197.44
agree

3206.4 --> 3210.0
right and you can never answer that

3208.16 --> 3212.3999999999996
that's right

3210.0 --> 3214.16
you'd have to say

3212.4 --> 3216.2400000000002
it all came into being all

3214.16 --> 3218.64
simultaneously well that is what it is

3216.24 --> 3220.8799999999997
saying but yeah that doesn't really make

3218.64 --> 3226.04
a lot of sense then again the big bang

3220.88 --> 3226.04
theory doesn't make any sense at all

3239.119 --> 3245.599
nothing to everything yeah

3241.599 --> 3249.44
nobody does actually kind of say that

3245.599 --> 3249.44
it says there was nothing

3249.76 --> 3256.0
before there was nothing then

3252.96 --> 3257.28
the big bang so zapdapi it actually did

3256.0 --> 3258.48
say that

3257.28 --> 3260.96
that is

3258.48 --> 3262.4
part of the

3260.96 --> 3265.4
fictional

3262.4 --> 3265.4
theory

3270.559 --> 3276.2200000000003
i mean do i need to google it

3272.8 --> 3279.3300000000004
i mean don't you even know like

3276.22 --> 3279.33
[Music]

3321.359 --> 3323.44
yo

3322.559 --> 3326.0
yeah

3323.44 --> 3329.7200000000003
then i don't know what happened

3326.0 --> 3329.72
thanks for telling me

3350.4 --> 3355.839
all right zap tepee i know what the

3353.04 --> 3357.2
point is about the bing bang theory

3355.839 --> 3359.119
from

3357.2 --> 3361.9199999999996
george lemaitre

3359.119 --> 3364.48
is that there wasn't anything before

3361.92 --> 3367.44
that that was the point that is the

3364.48 --> 3370.2400000000002
theory now of course people immediately

3367.44 --> 3371.4
upon hearing it including myself when i

3370.24 --> 3374.0789999999997
was a kid

3371.4 --> 3375.44
immediately start speculating of course

3374.079 --> 3377.04
like oh

3375.44 --> 3380.319
well that doesn't make any freaking

3377.04 --> 3382.5589999999997
sense but maybe if it's like this or

3380.319 --> 3386.0
that

3382.559 --> 3388.96
like i came up with like the

3386.0 --> 3390.48
big bang engine theory

3388.96 --> 3394.16
like immediately

3390.48 --> 3395.04
when i heard it about it when i was like

3394.16 --> 3398.0
is it

3395.04 --> 3398.0
12 or something

3398.319 --> 3401.52
it's just like oh big bang right oh well

3400.799 --> 3404.16
that

3401.52 --> 3405.44
that then has to mean it will also

3404.16 --> 3408.48
contract

3405.44 --> 3410.48
and explode again and again and again

3408.48 --> 3412.64
and again like an engine so that's

3410.48 --> 3414.64
what's my immediate conclusion upon

3412.64 --> 3419.04
hearing the big bang theory is like

3414.64 --> 3421.839
that's all garbage it has to be cyclical

3419.04 --> 3426.4
so it's going to be like an engine

3421.839 --> 3429.2
going off boom boom boom boom boom like

3426.4 --> 3430.839
of course it has to be that

3429.2 --> 3433.4399999999996
instant

3430.839 --> 3436.4
conclusion like it doesn't make any

3433.44 --> 3439.44
sense if it wasn't that

3436.4 --> 3441.76
presupposing of course any of it is real

3439.44 --> 3444.76
the big bang theory right

3441.76 --> 3444.76
so

3446.4 --> 3449.44
yeah like an engine

3450.4 --> 3455.92
explodes it contracts then it

3453.44 --> 3458.799
basically reunites in one

3455.92 --> 3461.2000000000003
universal black hole

3458.799 --> 3463.119
that then implodes and then it explodes

3461.2 --> 3466.0
again

3463.119 --> 3467.44
and then it starts all over again

3466.0 --> 3468.319
forever

3467.44 --> 3471.96
that's

3468.319 --> 3471.96
how i saw that

3478.079 --> 3481.8390000000004
i mean

3479.04 --> 3483.7599999999998
dude you literally believe in space-time

3481.839 --> 3486.4
bending you have to realize that when

3483.76 --> 3487.599
lumetra made this concept

3486.4 --> 3488.7200000000003
it was

3487.599 --> 3491.44
after

3488.72 --> 3492.64
einstein already changed

3491.44 --> 3495.359
gravity

3492.64 --> 3496.64
within the story you see

3495.359 --> 3497.68
so

3496.64 --> 3500.0789999999997
yeah

3497.68 --> 3501.2
like the big crunch and then it explodes

3500.079 --> 3503.8390000000004
again

3501.2 --> 3506.8799999999997
that's right see

3503.839 --> 3510.92
i mean it's not that far-fetched

3506.88 --> 3510.92
to think about it like that

3516.24 --> 3521.04
i mean if as a 12 year old kid i

3518.559 --> 3522.559
immediately draw that conclusion before

3521.04 --> 3524.4
even being

3522.559 --> 3526.4
told that there's such a thing as the

3524.4 --> 3527.599
big crunch or anything

3526.4 --> 3528.64
right

3527.599 --> 3531.28
then

3528.64 --> 3535.359
i'd say it has to be true

3531.28 --> 3538.1600000000003
from within the fictional story that is

3535.359 --> 3538.96
of course that has to be true

3538.16 --> 3541.52
because

3538.96 --> 3543.76
a kid came up with it immediately

3541.52 --> 3547.359
that usually means that that's the best

3543.76 --> 3547.3590000000004
course of action for the story

3547.92 --> 3551.359
okay not every kid

3549.76 --> 3555.48
the ones that actually

3551.359 --> 3555.48
have a talent for this

3561.119 --> 3566.799
god

3563.44 --> 3566.799
it's the same guy again

3567.52 --> 3571.68
where did the designer come from we

3569.359 --> 3573.52
don't know

3571.68 --> 3574.96
we don't know we don't know we don't

3573.52 --> 3577.359
know

3574.96 --> 3581.4
we don't know

3577.359 --> 3581.4
and you don't know either

3595.359 --> 3599.119
a creator creating reality

3599.68 --> 3606.319
well if you assumed that the universe is

3603.28 --> 3608.559
the realm that was created by god then

3606.319 --> 3610.0
yes and i know there's people that think

3608.559 --> 3612.1600000000003
like that

3610.0 --> 3614.0
they try to be biblical and then they

3612.16 --> 3616.16
just say no it's not the earth it's the

3614.0 --> 3618.079
entire universe

3616.16 --> 3618.96
it makes no sense but that's what we

3618.079 --> 3620.88
think

3618.96 --> 3624.079
yeah it's not you're not the first one

3620.88 --> 3624.079
to say something like that

3624.4 --> 3628.88
however the outer space

3626.48 --> 3631.359
universe is fictional that none of that

3628.88 --> 3634.079
is actually real that space isn't there

3631.359 --> 3635.7599999999998
the lights that we think are giant suns

3634.079 --> 3638.2400000000002
giant balls of fire

3635.76 --> 3643.2400000000002
a million times bigger than earth and

3638.24 --> 3643.24
and even larger that's all fiction

3644.4 --> 3648.88
they're just lights in the sky

3646.72 --> 3650.319
when you approach them they move with

3648.88 --> 3653.92
you they don't

3650.319 --> 3653.92
increase in angular size

3654.24 --> 3658.24
and when you go up high enough you don't

3655.76 --> 3661.119
see anything anymore

3658.24 --> 3661.1189999999997
barely anything

3661.28 --> 3666.48
so there's nothing there

3664.4 --> 3668.079
it's all in our minds and it's a great

3666.48 --> 3670.88
place

3668.079 --> 3673.44
to think about in your minds right

3670.88 --> 3675.6800000000003
it's really cool to use for science

3673.44 --> 3677.28
fiction stories and all that it's great

3675.68 --> 3679.2799999999997
i love it i love the outer space

3677.28 --> 3682.2400000000002
universe i love that idea

3679.28 --> 3684.799
it's not real though

3682.24 --> 3687.359
right

3684.799 --> 3690.24
i mean everybody has really beloved

3687.359 --> 3691.119
stories in their life

3690.24 --> 3692.799
like

3691.119 --> 3693.839
lord of the rings

3692.799 --> 3697.04
dude

3693.839 --> 3699.52
lord of the rings is not real

3697.04 --> 3702.96
you understand that

3699.52 --> 3705.28
but it is a beloved fictional place

3702.96 --> 3707.839
that makes a lot of sense to a whole

3705.28 --> 3709.92
bunch of people in many ways

3707.839 --> 3712.48
and has important life lessons on an

3709.92 --> 3714.64
esoteric level right because

3712.48 --> 3717.599
we can still share

3714.64 --> 3720.4
our spiritual natures with the fictional

3717.599 --> 3720.4
universes

3721.119 --> 3725.599
our spirits can literally

3723.359 --> 3728.799
be there as well even though it's not a

3725.599 --> 3730.1600000000003
real physical place to be

3728.799 --> 3733.68
and that's fine

3730.16 --> 3737.0389999999998
as long as you remember to get back in

3733.68 --> 3741.2799999999997
the real world and know what's real

3737.039 --> 3745.039
to properly earth yourself to actually

3741.28 --> 3747.52
be one with creation to be attuned to

3745.039 --> 3749.3590000000004
the designer to know what is real and

3747.52 --> 3750.96
what he made

3749.359 --> 3753.5989999999997
and then

3750.96 --> 3756.0
beside that realize the incredible

3753.599 --> 3759.3590000000004
potential of fantasy

3756.0 --> 3761.039
and the dangers because it will draw you

3759.359 --> 3763.119
away from that

3761.039 --> 3765.3590000000004
that knowing the real

3763.119 --> 3767.599
right and if you get tested in the real

3765.359 --> 3769.92
world things happen that you don't like

3767.599 --> 3771.839
yeah the fictional is going to be very

3769.92 --> 3774.319
appealing and you're going to be drawn

3771.839 --> 3776.96
to using it for escapism which is

3774.319 --> 3780.24
probably going to make things worse

3776.96 --> 3780.2400000000002
if you hold on too long

3781.44 --> 3785.28
because

3782.4 --> 3787.6800000000003
fantasy can definitely be used for

3785.28 --> 3791.92
neglection

3787.68 --> 3791.9199999999996
and that isn't a good thing that's a sin

3792.559 --> 3797.8390000000004
right and that's the dangers of fiction

3794.96 --> 3797.839
in the dream world

3799.119 --> 3803.839
too did you know that apparently in

3801.359 --> 3805.839
greek mythology which is like laid down

3803.839 --> 3807.0389999999998
in that series that i was watching blood

3805.839 --> 3809.599
of zeus

3807.039 --> 3812.0
they lay down a lot they basically like

3809.599 --> 3814.7200000000003
put the entire greek silmarillion in

3812.0 --> 3817.039
there as well and it is freaking epic

3814.72 --> 3819.9199999999996
man the battles and all that shit's like

3817.039 --> 3822.88
whoa dude

3819.92 --> 3827.52
there's a demon a winged demon called

3822.88 --> 3829.6800000000003
morpheus who is the lord of dreams

3827.52 --> 3831.839
okay

3829.68 --> 3835.359
yeah

3831.839 --> 3838.799
and it's a demon not a god it's a demon

3835.359 --> 3842.48
like a giant and nephilim basically

3838.799 --> 3845.52
because they have like nephilim

3842.48 --> 3848.52
it like dude the greek mythology then

3845.52 --> 3848.52
dude

3852.88 --> 3856.559
i'm like

3854.24 --> 3859.68
if you have any interest in any form of

3856.559 --> 3862.2400000000002
greek mythology with the gods and the

3859.68 --> 3863.5989999999997
the ancient past and all that

3862.24 --> 3866.0389999999998
watch this thing

3863.599 --> 3868.48
i haven't even caught it on any

3866.039 --> 3871.2000000000003
heliocentrism at all

3868.48 --> 3873.359
like i'm not detecting it there's no oh

3871.2 --> 3875.839
look oh high above earth is a ball

3873.359 --> 3878.48
nothing nothing at all it's not about

3875.839 --> 3881.2
that at all so far at least it's not

3878.48 --> 3884.96
gonna be i hope right

3881.2 --> 3888.16
so yeah blood of zeus on netflix check

3884.96 --> 3888.88
it out man it's super impressive but it

3888.16 --> 3891.7599999999998
is

3888.88 --> 3895.599
very gory

3891.76 --> 3899.039
like it's not mega horror gory like some

3895.599 --> 3902.1600000000003
manga anime [Â __Â ] but it is freaking gory

3899.039 --> 3903.6800000000003
you do like basically suffered heads and

3902.16 --> 3905.44
limbs and

3903.68 --> 3909.7599999999998
blood and [Â __Â ]

3905.44 --> 3913.119
so that does happen it is it is gruesome

3909.76 --> 3913.119
and it is a lot about war

3913.44 --> 3918.64
but yeah war between the gods and the

3916.4 --> 3920.2400000000002
demons and the humans it is almost like

3918.64 --> 3922.72
that in a way

3920.24 --> 3925.68
kind of like the diablo

3922.72 --> 3928.8799999999997
computer franchise story

3925.68 --> 3932.24
which very obviously is rather based on

3928.88 --> 3935.2400000000002
this rather dude it's

3932.24 --> 3935.24
heavy

3943.76 --> 3949.96
now

3944.96 --> 3949.96
nephilim not have angel half human

3956.64 --> 3961.44
i said no wait it is

3958.799 --> 3961.44
now you're right

3961.52 --> 3966.96
but they have their form yeah

3964.88 --> 3970.6400000000003
like if you watch this

3966.96 --> 3973.28
it's laid out very quickly with like a

3970.64 --> 3975.2799999999997
lot of action animation with like gods

3973.28 --> 3977.52
fighting and [Â __Â ] like dude

3975.28 --> 3979.6800000000003
i mean

3977.52 --> 3981.52
seriously

3979.68 --> 3983.44
like a thor

3981.52 --> 3984.4
in

3983.44 --> 3986.559
in like

3984.4 --> 3989.44
what is it called again

3986.559 --> 3991.599
in marvel and all that dude do you think

3989.44 --> 3994.7200000000003
those fights are cool and impressive

3991.599 --> 3996.799
dude it's for [Â __Â ] wussies

3994.72 --> 3997.9199999999996
watch this thing like

3996.799 --> 3999.599
do

3997.92 --> 4002.799
think

3999.599 --> 4007.52
thundercats animation intro

4002.799 --> 4010.72
and then the entire thing non-stop

4007.52 --> 4014.079
it is literally that epic

4010.72 --> 4017.0389999999998
more epic even with freaking

4014.079 --> 4019.76
yeah greek pantheon gods finding

4017.039 --> 4022.7200000000003
fighting against titans and [Â __Â ]

4019.76 --> 4022.7200000000003
unbelievable

4023.69 --> 4031.16
[Music]

4026.72 --> 4031.16
archons yes they're in there

4036.079 --> 4040.559
i'm just saying if you think that

4037.52 --> 4044.16
thundercats intro was awesome

4040.559 --> 4047.2000000000003
this is like that intro except it's the

4044.16 --> 4050.16
entire series

4047.2 --> 4052.8799999999997
like every action is to that level cool

4050.16 --> 4052.8799999999997
and animated

4053.2 --> 4058.48
and there's swords lots of them

4056.559 --> 4060.4
and they have like they have a four ball

4058.48 --> 4063.039
sword okay

4060.4 --> 4065.039
freaking zeus creates a vorpal sword

4063.039 --> 4068.559
literally that could just slice

4065.039 --> 4071.76
mountains without even exerting force

4068.559 --> 4071.76
it's [Â __Â ] insane

4074.48 --> 4077.839
right so again

4079.58 --> 4082.699
[Music]

4088.77 --> 4092.98
[Music]

4094.0 --> 4100.96
french trailer what is it french

4098.64 --> 4102.400000000001
what

4100.96 --> 4105.6
wow

4102.4 --> 4108.719
derek phillips jason omar

4105.6 --> 4108.719
from 2020

4109.759 --> 4112.319
i guess

4114.88 --> 4119.319
all right when i'm linking you up to the

4116.319 --> 4119.319
imdb

4127.04 --> 4133.48
oh yeah you pretty much get to see

4129.44 --> 4133.48
heavy [Â __Â ] right away

4161.33 --> 4164.55
[Music]

4170.4 --> 4177.12
dude is that still the

4172.799 --> 4177.12
that's still the same numpty [Â __Â ]

4187.199 --> 4189.839
really

4189.92 --> 4194.319
okay i couldn't i think you would

4191.359 --> 4194.319
appreciate it a lot

4201.28 --> 4207.159
it's a good one this one

4203.52 --> 4207.159000000001
it really is

4207.38 --> 4210.59
[Music]

4213.59 --> 4217.939
[Music]

4222.159 --> 4226.4
by the way the greek pantheon is really

4224.96 --> 4228.08
[Â __Â ]

4226.4 --> 4228.96
like seriously

4228.08 --> 4231.84
like

4228.96 --> 4235.12
they're almost more cursed

4231.84 --> 4235.12
it's so weird

4236.32 --> 4238.5599999999995
it

4242.719 --> 4250.44
it is all so

4245.84 --> 4250.4400000000005
mystical in a way really

4263.44 --> 4268.159
by the way i never understood like why

4266.56 --> 4270.0
zeus freaking

4268.159 --> 4272.48
married hera

4270.0 --> 4274.8
like why the hell did you do that man

4272.48 --> 4277.36
was it because she was the only goddess

4274.8 --> 4280.0
there at the time

4277.36 --> 4280.0
or something

4280.08 --> 4283.6
probably

4281.199 --> 4286.639999999999
but holy [Â __Â ]

4283.6 --> 4289.280000000001
like she is like the ultimate evil gamma

4286.64 --> 4291.76
queen she really is is like everything

4289.28 --> 4293.759999999999
about her always just freaking jealousy

4291.76 --> 4296.719
and envy everything she is like the

4293.76 --> 4299.719
ultimate gamma goddess

4296.719 --> 4299.719
terrible

4300.159 --> 4304.4
so you gotta really feel for zeus but

4302.32 --> 4306.719
like why the hell did you even do that

4304.4 --> 4306.719
man

4312.32 --> 4317.989
uh

4314.81 --> 4317.9890000000005
[Music]

4351.04 --> 4356.08
anyway i'm i'm exhilarating to watch it

4353.92 --> 4357.52
i almost wish there was more of this i'd

4356.08 --> 4360.8
like to see

4357.52 --> 4364.56
like all the greek mythologies

4360.8 --> 4366.4800000000005
put into like this style and format this

4364.56 --> 4367.92
level of seriousness that would be

4366.48 --> 4368.718999999999
really epic

4367.92 --> 4371.52
if

4368.719 --> 4373.12
yeah maybe but i thought it's good and

4371.52 --> 4375.92
yeah i've always been fascinated by

4373.12 --> 4377.5199999999995
greek mythology i had greek mythology in

4375.92 --> 4380.08
school

4377.52 --> 4381.92
on my waldorf school time years

4380.08 --> 4385.44
basically

4381.92 --> 4389.52
and like that was very important to me

4385.44 --> 4392.32
it's like it is extremely fascinating

4389.52 --> 4395.280000000001
the greek pantheon because

4392.32 --> 4396.5599999999995
if you look at them esoterically instead

4395.28 --> 4400.08
of literal

4396.56 --> 4402.8
and because of like this the

4400.08 --> 4405.199
they are like the principal powers of

4402.8 --> 4409.1990000000005
certain effects

4405.199 --> 4411.678999999999
so they're like this energy force

4409.199 --> 4414.678999999999
that are personified it's all just so

4411.679 --> 4414.679
fascinating

4415.1 --> 4418.279
[Music]

4428.88 --> 4432.4800000000005
what i've been doing in the past year

4433.679 --> 4438.0
yeah i know september

4436.48 --> 4440.5599999999995
you were banned for quite a while

4438.0 --> 4442.719
because you were acting like a you know

4440.56 --> 4444.56
what or you probably don't and that's

4442.719 --> 4445.92
why you're back

4444.56 --> 4448.64
but uh

4445.92 --> 4451.679
i've been doing pretty well

4448.64 --> 4453.04
financially maybe not so well compared

4451.679 --> 4455.679
to last year

4453.04 --> 4458.159
but maybe that's to be expected with the

4455.679 --> 4460.88
situation in the world right now could

4458.159 --> 4463.36
sure use some more support

4460.88 --> 4466.0
because my debts are now growing and i'm

4463.36 --> 4469.36
not happy about that but overall

4466.0 --> 4471.44
my health is pretty decent

4469.36 --> 4474.48
despite

4471.44 --> 4474.48
certain moments

4475.52 --> 4480.080000000001
uh

4477.6 --> 4482.320000000001
and i think i'm developing pretty well

4480.08 --> 4484.96
i'm very satisfied with my performance

4482.32 --> 4484.96
on average

4485.04 --> 4489.84
the real issues remain though long long

4488.0 --> 4492.08
silences

4489.84 --> 4492.08
right

4493.199 --> 4498.719
and sometimes my pronunciation

4496.48 --> 4500.718999999999
gets a little messy when i listen back

4498.719 --> 4503.6
i'm like okay i could have said that a

4500.719 --> 4503.6
lot more clear

4503.92 --> 4508.88
like why didn't

4506.159 --> 4512.08
i just make a little bit extra effort to

4508.88 --> 4513.92
be audible that would be great

4512.08 --> 4517.5599999999995
so i'm

4513.92 --> 4517.56
focusing on that

4524.08 --> 4529.44
i've been on jim bob a couple of times

4526.08 --> 4529.44
don't know if you know who that is

4530.4 --> 4535.04
made by jim bob he's in my favorite list

4532.88 --> 4538.0
on my channel now this is really

4535.04 --> 4540.64
interesting a guy that's very good at

4538.0 --> 4542.8
discussing philosophy even with brenda

4540.64 --> 4542.8
so

4545.04 --> 4548.159
okay

4546.0 --> 4552.76
my spoken english accent is excellent

4548.159 --> 4552.759999999999
well thank you for that i guess

4558.0 --> 4562.8
but i do get a bit stumbly sometimes

4560.719 --> 4565.44
right bit short

4562.8 --> 4568.4800000000005
and i don't always have like this wide

4565.44 --> 4570.96
range of words available to me like

4568.48 --> 4572.718999999999
sometimes i can get like the perfect

4570.96 --> 4575.199
word for the perfect moment just like

4572.719 --> 4578.08
that and other times it's like i don't

4575.199 --> 4581.839999999999
really know how to say this yeah

4578.08 --> 4581.84
so it kind of varies from day to day

4588.88 --> 4594.88
no gadget inspector that's terrible

4592.64 --> 4596.719
i am probably going to take a look back

4594.88 --> 4599.6
at the church again but i'm not going to

4596.719 --> 4601.36
go skirt looking

4599.6 --> 4602.8
that's gross

4601.36 --> 4604.159
that's not what you're supposed to be

4602.8 --> 4606.56
doing

4604.159 --> 4608.08
that would be like snatching women away

4606.56 --> 4611.360000000001
from a church they're not gonna

4608.08 --> 4611.36
appreciate that okay

4618.0 --> 4622.8
besides before i even go there i still

4620.0 --> 4625.28
have to like completely become myself

4622.8 --> 4628.56
again so that well what happened last

4625.28 --> 4628.5599999999995
time doesn't happen again

4628.96 --> 4634.4
i was a little too enthusiastic and that

4631.199 --> 4636.48
way my empathy kind of contracted

4634.4 --> 4639.28
like dark suppressed spirits from

4636.48 --> 4639.28
another person

4639.76 --> 4642.0
so

4642.32 --> 4647.199
but i'm not gonna go skirt hunting

4644.4 --> 4647.199
that's gross

4648.08 --> 4652.64
i don't think those women would

4649.52 --> 4652.64
appreciate that either

4653.76 --> 4656.0
uh

4657.36 --> 4662.48
don't go to a catholic what i don't even

4659.76 --> 4665.04
know where a catholic church is

4662.48 --> 4666.959999999999
and i know they're not a real christians

4665.04 --> 4670.32
like it doesn't even feel like a church

4666.96 --> 4670.32
in the catholic church so

4670.64 --> 4674.679
unless there's nobody there

4685.52 --> 4693.320000000001
uh i don't know about that but

4688.239 --> 4693.32
i think power is more of the directive

4699.6 --> 4702.6
dude

4720.64 --> 4726.08
yeah adam and steve dude gadget

4723.199 --> 4727.12
inspector is french

4726.08 --> 4729.84
okay

4727.12 --> 4732.5599999999995
take that into account

4729.84 --> 4735.52
he has the right to talk like that even

4732.56 --> 4738.159000000001
in english because he's french

4735.52 --> 4738.159000000001
they do that

4739.92 --> 4746.159
you are in the yoga church one

4742.97 --> 4746.159000000001
[Music]

4759.36 --> 4763.28
it doesn't matter

4761.199 --> 4766.159
if you're gonna live in france you

4763.28 --> 4766.159
become french

4766.4 --> 4770.0
especially if you go there young

4774.08 --> 4778.48
unless you start yeah unless you're

4776.0 --> 4780.32
gonna specifically separate yourself

4778.48 --> 4782.718999999999
from the rest of the french people and

4780.32 --> 4784.799999999999
start to form ghettos and then you don't

4782.719 --> 4786.4
become french

4784.8 --> 4788.84
if you don't do that and you integrate

4786.4 --> 4790.799999999999
you become french it just

4788.84 --> 4792.719
happens

4790.8 --> 4795.96
start to talk and you start to think

4792.719 --> 4795.96
like that

4809.92 --> 4814.679
that's done what are you talking about

4811.44 --> 4814.678999999999
george sanford

4824.88 --> 4827.1990000000005
uh

4827.6 --> 4832.84
don't flatter yourself too much adam and

4829.84 --> 4832.84
steve

4849.04 --> 4853.76
i mean

4850.32 --> 4855.92
you probably haven't had a long-term

4853.76 --> 4858.0
chat history with gadget inspector i

4855.92 --> 4858.8
have

4858.0 --> 4863.199
i

4858.8 --> 4865.12
have to know he's a very enthusiastic

4863.199 --> 4866.638999999999
french person even though he might have

4865.12 --> 4868.96
originally been from england but he's

4866.639 --> 4872.08
still young he's living in france he is

4868.96 --> 4873.199
typically french because of that

4872.08 --> 4874.88
and

4873.199 --> 4876.879999999999
yeah

4874.88 --> 4879.52
he very much likes the ladies and

4876.88 --> 4882.639
chasing them in french typical young

4879.52 --> 4884.719
fashion so it's just that the church is

4882.639 --> 4886.96
not really the right place to do that

4884.719 --> 4889.52
especially if you're new there

4886.96 --> 4893.12
right that's literally like stealing

4889.52 --> 4895.679
you're from ireland that's even worse

4893.12 --> 4898.32
then you're even more french that is not

4895.679 --> 4901.6
surprising at all if you're an irishman

4898.32 --> 4903.12
in france a young irishman in france

4901.6 --> 4906.08
dude

4903.12 --> 4908.96
you then adapt then you are french

4906.08 --> 4912.5199999999995
doesn't matter how irish you look

4908.96 --> 4912.52
you are french

4921.59 --> 4925.88
[Music]

4931.28 --> 4934.28
anyhow

4946.639 --> 4951.12
that's by the way a really hilarious

4948.719 --> 4954.08
order of saying things

4951.12 --> 4956.239
i get the idea he's an artist nah i'm

4954.08 --> 4957.6
from ireland

4956.239 --> 4961.28
what

4957.6 --> 4961.280000000001
he was addressing me of course but

4962.56 --> 4965.76
all right yeah good to have you here

4964.159 --> 4967.599999999999
gadget inspector thanks for being in

4965.76 --> 4970.639
chat and all of you by the way i think

4967.6 --> 4972.56
i'm going to round out the show

4970.639 --> 4974.56
it's silly

4972.56 --> 4977.4400000000005
situation anyway don't forget to check

4974.56 --> 4978.4800000000005
out a lot of zeus

4977.44 --> 4981.36
if you're

4978.48 --> 4983.36
at least 12 years old

4981.36 --> 4986.5599999999995
really intense

4983.36 --> 4988.239
it is thrilling exciting don't take

4986.56 --> 4990.400000000001
hallucinogenics

4988.239 --> 4993.12
while you watch it it might become too

4990.4 --> 4995.12
much for you like the implications are

4993.12 --> 4997.28
pretty heavy since it is really

4995.12 --> 5001.48
seriously based on greek mythology and

4997.28 --> 5001.48
there is things to that

5001.84 --> 5006.56
right so be careful

5005.199 --> 5007.759999999999
don't go watching while you're out of

5006.56 --> 5010.0
your mind

5007.76 --> 5010.0
right

5011.44 --> 5015.839999999999
i mean seriously

5013.199 --> 5015.839999999999
like

5015.92 --> 5020.4
it's kind of dangerous in my opinion to

5018.159 --> 5022.719
combine it

5020.4 --> 5025.719
greek mythology in general with like

5022.719 --> 5025.719
hallucinogenics

5033.04 --> 5038.32
don't trip well well dude you could like

5035.76 --> 5038.320000000001
i don't know

5038.48 --> 5041.919999999999
i'm not saying like oh if you're

5040.159 --> 5044.32
typically like a joint smoker or

5041.92 --> 5046.2390000000005
something then don't smoke no i did that

5044.32 --> 5049.679
too it's just that

5046.239 --> 5052.638999999999
don't go like really chugging

5049.679 --> 5055.04
drinks or whatever eat a mushroom some

5052.639 --> 5056.719
weird type you know don't do that just

5055.04 --> 5058.4
take it easy

5056.719 --> 5060.639
just take it easy while you're watching

5058.4 --> 5064.12
it don't

5060.639 --> 5064.12
don't go tripping

5064.14 --> 5067.35
[Music]

5073.52 --> 5076.0
what

5074.56 --> 5079.0
he talks to you what are you talking

5076.0 --> 5079.0
about

5084.55 --> 5087.7390000000005
[Music]

5092.08 --> 5097.239
what are you talking about he's dog [Â __Â ]

5093.6 --> 5097.2390000000005
he talk what

5099.44 --> 5101.839999999999
dave

5105.92 --> 5110.96
okay

5107.44 --> 5110.96
how did you know that then

5111.36 --> 5114.08
lucky guess

5124.0 --> 5129.199
i agree though because i'm pretty sure

5127.28 --> 5133.5199999999995
that adam and steve is the same guy that

5129.199 --> 5133.5199999999995
i banned like seven times before this

5135.28 --> 5139.44
but fine he's

5136.96 --> 5142.32
now choosing to somehow

5139.44 --> 5145.28
show himself as a normal person so then

5142.32 --> 5147.679
he can stay that's how it works yeah a

5145.28 --> 5149.84
lot of people might start out as troll

5147.679 --> 5152.159
[Â __Â ] in my chat and i'll keep

5149.84 --> 5154.56
disciplining them and disciplining them

5152.159 --> 5158.08
until they fall in line and start to

5154.56 --> 5159.92
behave like a normal boy

5158.08 --> 5163.679
and then you can stay

5159.92 --> 5167.04
that's how we went with the kumu virus

5163.679 --> 5169.76
you know that's how it works

5167.04 --> 5171.5199999999995
because everybody can be in a place in

5169.76 --> 5173.280000000001
their life where they can be absolute

5171.52 --> 5175.52
dicks and they're just wasting their own

5173.28 --> 5178.0
time and everybody's time and nagging

5175.52 --> 5179.040000000001
other people

5178.0 --> 5181.04
well

5179.04 --> 5184.0
they still have an opportunity for a

5181.04 --> 5186.8
redemption arc to get out of that

5184.0 --> 5191.04
yeah to stop trying to be a special boy

5186.8 --> 5191.04
and just act like a decent human being

5191.199 --> 5197.36
and then they can suddenly from being a

5193.84 --> 5199.12
just a nuisance and a plague turned into

5197.36 --> 5201.839999999999
oh yeah

5199.12 --> 5203.12
a contributing factor

5201.84 --> 5204.4800000000005
in the circle

5203.12 --> 5206.719
