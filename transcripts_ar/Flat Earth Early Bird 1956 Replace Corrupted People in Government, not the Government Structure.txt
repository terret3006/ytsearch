118.56 --> 124.479
rain yeah to get groceries yesterday

122.24 --> 126.479
when I did get groceries I did not

124.479 --> 130.08
manage to avoid any rain there was like

126.479 --> 133.56
this massive black

130.08 --> 135.4
cloud and when I went out for groceries

133.56 --> 138.92000000000002

135.4 --> 138.92000000000002
full the full

140.28 --> 145.16
bucket but I did have an umbrella with

142.599 --> 147.0
me but it just didn't matter because of

145.16 --> 150.56
the wind was just way too heavy and

147.0 --> 153.36
everything so it was just complet soaked

150.56 --> 155.959
when I got back that's why I thought

153.36 --> 160.36
okay let's maybe go a little bit earlier

155.959 --> 162.56
so that I don't have to go get super

160.36 --> 164.8
wet after the

162.56 --> 166.12
show and in the hopes of getting an

164.8 --> 169.84
Illuminati

166.12 --> 172.28
croissant but yeah they didn't have any

169.84 --> 177.159
Unfortunately

172.28 --> 181.319
today but I did get a regular

177.159 --> 185.959
crossa how an orthodox

181.319 --> 185.95899999999997

2024 temperatures 18° C so it did go

210.68 --> 215.12

212.36 --> 217.28
bit but it's still still kind of nice

215.12 --> 217.28
and

217.56 --> 221.56
warm especially when the sun comes out

220.08 --> 222.56
but doesn't look like that's happening

221.56 --> 225.159
anytime

222.56 --> 230.36
soon then again there's a lot of wind so

225.159 --> 230.35999999999999
it could just change around back to

234.56 --> 240.439
Blue 72% humidity sheesh

243.12 --> 246.68
oh fiber oats good to see

246.76 --> 253.35999999999999

250.04 --> 253.35999999999999
sip out of my from my

254.93 --> 264.6
[Music]

260.28 --> 266.52
coffee I wasn't up all that late but it

264.6 --> 269.72
just

266.52 --> 272.15999999999997
feel really like my muscles feel very B

269.72 --> 275.44000000000005
walked down for some reason

272.16 --> 276.32000000000005
like was very tiresome going on the bike

275.44 --> 278.84
out

276.32 --> 280.49
there I thought like oh yeah I'll just

278.84 --> 282.32
like wake up but I mean it's just

280.49 --> 285.96000000000004
[Music]

282.32 --> 285.96
like I don't know

288.039 --> 291.919
why pretty good dinner

298.4 --> 305.479
yesterday hey did eat very

301.96 --> 308.88
late like at after

305.479 --> 311.88
2:00 maybe that has something to do

308.88 --> 316.199
that that's something I usually don't

311.88 --> 316.199
do right anyhow

333.15 --> 336.34999999999997
[Music]

337.24 --> 342.24
was just checking out another my lunch

339.88 --> 345.88
break

342.24 --> 348.68
video but yeah it didn't get very far

345.88 --> 350.15999999999997
it's but it's yeah about the the same

348.68 --> 353.84000000000003
typical

350.16 --> 356.319
thing also Jay dreamers had a show

353.84 --> 356.31899999999996
yesterday

356.639 --> 361.52
apparently watched a bit of that

363.36 --> 368.24
it's it's interesting to see like how he

365.84 --> 370.56
how he does his show because he does it

368.24 --> 370.56
live

371.16 --> 377.639
too he is yeah he doesn't do it like

374.36 --> 380.36
daily and he he does come prepared with

377.639 --> 380.36
material

385.56 --> 389.56
so uh

401.44 --> 407.56
yeah my own video from yesterday the

403.88 --> 407.56
early R show yesterday was very

410.199 --> 417.72
Rowdy I did kind of ask for it to with

413.639 --> 417.72
the title that I gave it

422.0 --> 428.44
just never ceases to amaze me that

424.919 --> 431.31899999999996
Ballers will just never give

428.44 --> 435.319
up pretty much no M pretty much no

431.319 --> 435.319
matter what no matter what

435.879 --> 440.56
happens once they get going and

438.639 --> 443.479
triggered they'll just start nitpicking

440.56 --> 443.479
you to death with

444.479 --> 451.24
anything like do anything to like make

448.0 --> 451.24
the situation

451.52 --> 457.96
politically color in their

454.16 --> 459.47900000000004
favor so what they do it's a very

457.96 --> 463.31899999999996
tedious

459.479 --> 463.31899999999996
game hello Bobby

468.96 --> 474.71999999999997
McGee all right I'm going to take a bite

471.68 --> 474.72
out of my regular

475.44 --> 482.479
croissant just uh hope that wakes me up

478.159 --> 482.479
a bit cheers for

527.36 --> 533.24
what hello debatable

530.24 --> 538.279
D what do you mean thank goodness my

533.24 --> 538.279
video is only at 144p

548.68 --> 552.1999999999999
yeah regular croissants are very

550.48 --> 556.8000000000001
different from Illuminati

552.2 --> 556.8000000000001
croissants they're really nice

589.56 --> 592.56
m

602.76 --> 606.3199999999999
okay what do you mean

621.44 --> 626.48
mikich what were you going to say like

624.32 --> 627.9590000000001
what's getting blocked if you just try

626.48 --> 630.76
to

627.959 --> 634.5999999999999
paraphrase that could could help give

630.76 --> 634.6
pointers as to why it didn't

635.04 --> 640.4399999999999
appear this has happened several times

637.519 --> 640.44
okay yeah that is kind of

642.6 --> 646.839
weird I mean I'm getting it from other

644.92 --> 650.4799999999999
people too like including people that

646.839 --> 653.36
have wrenches like that's really

650.48 --> 655.519
weird so there's some kind of

653.36 --> 658.519
algorithmic meddling or whatever going

655.519 --> 658.519
on

669.76 --> 674.3199999999999
I think sometimes it has something to do

671.68 --> 674.3199999999999
just with my

674.8 --> 680.3599999999999
attitude that I get this kind of these

678.079 --> 683.3599999999999
kinds of issues because of my attitude

680.36 --> 683.36
because I am so

697.2 --> 703.12
basically what YouTube timed you out for

700.079 --> 703.12
five minutes what does that

716.72 --> 721.279
mean right anyway yeah I'm sorry to hear

719.48 --> 724.48
that Mike sadun very annoying when

721.279 --> 727.079
YouTube Just blocks

724.48 --> 730.0790000000001
people it's very strange when it does

727.079 --> 730.079
that

758.89 --> 761.9399999999999
[Music]

767.98 --> 773.88
[Music]

770.48 --> 773.88

808.12 --> 812.079
q for

827.26 --> 830.34
[Music]

838.23 --> 844.229
[Music]

848.88 --> 854.6
oh q and Fe

851.399 --> 857.079
okay yeah well uh you don't have a

854.6 --> 857.0790000000001
wrench

859.399 --> 865.44
so but if you were going to say

861.68 --> 867.199
something about a video P then yeah I

865.44 --> 870.32
don't see why why you should have been

867.199 --> 873.419
blocked for that

870.32 --> 873.4190000000001
[Music]

873.68 --> 877.2399999999999
what was it about

905.279 --> 907.959
the final

909.519 --> 914.72
experiment that's a video from a day ago

953.199 --> 956.199
h

959.079 --> 967.12
q and Fe has been

961.759 --> 967.12
busy kind of slipped my attention there

995.22 --> 998.3090000000001
[Music]

1014.16 --> 1017.399
Okay so

1026.079 --> 1030.799
right but I mean it's basically a video

1028.319 --> 1033.76
of flatso reviewing something else

1030.799 --> 1038.28
reviewing something it's it's another

1033.76 --> 1038.28
one of those cluster screw videos

1049.28 --> 1056.12
we were having a nice chat and YouTube

1050.96 --> 1061.32
time me no no Moxy I timed you

1056.12 --> 1061.32
out not YouTube me I did

1061.33 --> 1064.4199999999998
[Music]

1066.92 --> 1070.029
[Music]

1076.559 --> 1080.84
that hello Burns

1094.32 --> 1104.3999999999999
way to keep it PG13 in real time

1099.96 --> 1104.4
uh I'm just trying to find the right

1105.24 --> 1111.08
[Music]

1107.52 --> 1114.32
balance the f word is apparently really

1111.08 --> 1118.24
disruptive it's just that sometime

1114.32 --> 1122.039
like I could like reduce the amount of

1118.24 --> 1124.84
FS that I use during my show but it's

1122.039 --> 1129.679
like when people specifically are like

1124.84 --> 1134.52
oh no you didn't then I'm like f f f f

1129.679 --> 1136.919
like F you because like I hate it when

1134.52 --> 1140.0
people act all outraged for saying the f

1136.919 --> 1143.159
word and like dude f

1140.0 --> 1147.159
you like that makes it makes me want to

1143.159 --> 1149.24
do it way more because it's just

1147.159 --> 1150.64
nonsense to be out like if I'm like

1149.24 --> 1154.919
saying the f

1150.64 --> 1158.7990000000002
word twice in every damn sentence or

1154.919 --> 1161.3600000000001
whatever okay that's

1158.799 --> 1163.6399999999999
Overkill but if I just say it a couple

1161.36 --> 1169.28
of times or especially if I'm suddenly

1163.64 --> 1169.2800000000002
pissed off like dude just get over it

1171.4 --> 1176.5590000000002
like as soon as people are like oh it's

1173.32 --> 1179.1589999999999
not oh not suitable for my kids I'm like

1176.559 --> 1182.12
what the what the hell

1179.159 --> 1187.72
man why are you letting your kids watch

1182.12 --> 1192.1999999999998
me like that like that's not supposed to

1187.72 --> 1195.039
be the setup here like that's not good

1192.2 --> 1197.919
I'm not a kid's Entertainer I mean I'm

1195.039 --> 1199.28
very entertaining in ways and I have a

1197.919 --> 1202.48
wide range

1199.28 --> 1207.08
of knowledge and insights and all that

1202.48 --> 1211.32
but like what I'm doing is not Tinker

1207.08 --> 1214.96
Tailor to dealing with kids because that

1211.32 --> 1217.3999999999999
limits my reach of what I can do and I

1214.96 --> 1217.4
don't want

1222.48 --> 1226.799
to right so if you're going to have kids

1225.12 --> 1231.1999999999998
there your kids are going to have to

1226.799 --> 1234.72
deal with adults that get pissed off and

1231.2 --> 1240.039
that get very hot tempered that kind of

1234.72 --> 1240.039
thing because that's part of what I do

1244.72 --> 1249.24
here right

1246.52 --> 1251.6399999999999
besides in that sense you could even say

1249.24 --> 1253.72
like or maybe the kids will say like why

1251.64 --> 1256.3200000000002
do my parents always have to be such

1253.72 --> 1258.72
freaking

1256.32 --> 1261.559
wussies like it's not like we don't know

1258.72 --> 1265.64
swear words they just want to learn so

1261.559 --> 1267.72
maybe kids are like no screw you Daddy

1265.64 --> 1270.2
stop being such a

1267.72 --> 1273.039
[ __ ] we just want to listen and then

1270.2 --> 1276.32
I'm like okay well if the kids are like

1273.039 --> 1280.32
that then yeah by all means I mean this

1276.32 --> 1283.1589999999999
is a effectively a psychological study

1280.32 --> 1287.36
and if you're like well attuned to that

1283.159 --> 1290.5200000000002
without getting all like adrenaline or

1287.36 --> 1294.1999999999998
getting nightmares or something

1290.52 --> 1294.2
afterward then it's all

1294.88 --> 1300.72
good if if your mind is like

1297.88 --> 1305.24
intellectually young matured which mine

1300.72 --> 1305.24
was as well then this should work just

1311.4 --> 1318.8400000000001
fine but I mean I'm not a little

1314.2 --> 1322.52
children Entertainer I mean no just no I

1318.84 --> 1325.279
mean you might tap ideas out of how I do

1322.52 --> 1328.799
things to entertain your children but

1325.279 --> 1328.799
that's not what I'm doing

1329.64 --> 1336.76
here right so people that complain about

1333.039 --> 1336.76
that kind of annoy

1338.62 --> 1341.6999999999998
[Music]

1343.679 --> 1349.799
me you wouldn't let kids watch this

1346.799 --> 1349.799
stuff

1353.32 --> 1360.3999999999999
well I would some type of kids but I

1357.919 --> 1365.4
mean it would be very helpful though if

1360.4 --> 1365.4
if they would like made it

1366.4 --> 1371.24
known like if they actually Reach Out

1369.44 --> 1373.279
themselves and

1371.24 --> 1374.64
just yeah that would make things

1373.279 --> 1377.039
different and that's happened before

1374.64 --> 1379.88
I've had young people like 12 year olds

1377.039 --> 1381.799
and 14 year olds that like come in my

1379.88 --> 1385.4
chat and just ask questions and stuff

1381.799 --> 1386.84
and I'm like yeah that works and then

1385.4 --> 1390.52
I'll even

1386.84 --> 1390.52
adapt the behavior

1395.279 --> 1401.0
somewhat but you can't just force me to

1397.88 --> 1403.0390000000002
transform my entire show setup based on

1401.0 --> 1407.039
that

1403.039 --> 1407.039
so whatever

1411.84 --> 1418.6
I would be a good magician to do magic

1414.2 --> 1420.76
tricks for kids barely I just tell them

1418.6 --> 1425.039
and show them interesting

1420.76 --> 1425.039
things not magician tricks

1429.12 --> 1433.52
though it's never been my thing

1436.559 --> 1442.1589999999999
really when I was younger

1439.159 --> 1444.24
maybe because I had just this incredible

1442.159 --> 1448.44
quickness to

1444.24 --> 1450.48
me which I still mostly have but I mean

1448.44 --> 1454.96
I'm just not as

1450.48 --> 1457.159
quick like on a fluid perfect intuitive

1454.96 --> 1459.919
quickness

1457.159 --> 1463.96
so I mean theoretically I could get

1459.919 --> 1463.96
there again if I like boost myself

1464.08 --> 1470.36
up but yeah don't have to funds for that

1467.76 --> 1470.36
kind of thing

1481.12 --> 1484.6399999999999
but yeah no I'm much more

1485.76 --> 1492.279
about esoterics

1489.0 --> 1495.12
and helping to give you insight for your

1492.279 --> 1497.24
conscious as to just how things work how

1495.12 --> 1500.6399999999999
the mechanisms work including the

1497.24 --> 1500.64
mechanisms of your own

1501.399 --> 1507.76
functioning I know per default your own

1504.559 --> 1511.96
functioning you kind of take it for

1507.76 --> 1513.8799999999999
granted but there's always steps further

1511.96 --> 1516.8400000000001
you

1513.88 --> 1519.5200000000002
can work on

1516.84 --> 1521.9189999999999
it but in order to do that you first got

1519.52 --> 1524.399
to have an understanding of how the next

1521.919 --> 1527.76
layers basically

1524.399 --> 1530.039
work of yourself you're not just going

1527.76 --> 1532.24
to mess with something that just seems

1530.039 --> 1534.36
to work just fine without you messing

1532.24 --> 1534.36
with

1535.33 --> 1538.4399999999998
[Music]

1539.919 --> 1542.919
it

1556.96 --> 1560.24
anyway okay

1574.76 --> 1582.12
Moxy your kids yeah whatever

1579.24 --> 1584.679
man you could just be an incredible dick

1582.12 --> 1588.559
sometimes Moxy and I

1584.679 --> 1590.88
mean it's been nice for a while but

1588.559 --> 1592.96
you're soliciting a permanent ban you

1590.88 --> 1594.7990000000002
have been for a while now and you're not

1592.96 --> 1600.3600000000001
changing your attitude or

1594.799 --> 1600.36
anything and I just don't like your tone

1601.799 --> 1609.0
recently so I'd like to give you a

1604.679 --> 1611.8400000000001
warning that yeah if you just keep it

1609.0 --> 1614.76
up I will just kick you out and then you

1611.84 --> 1618.279
will be banned again like you have been

1614.76 --> 1621.399
for so long for the same reasons that

1618.279 --> 1621.399
that you have been so

1639.399 --> 1643.12
long hello Tim

1644.88 --> 1649.5590000000002
Osman okay Tim Osman

1650.76 --> 1653.76
it

1670.3 --> 1673.5
[Music]

1680.799 --> 1688.399
right Mike sadun is still there or is it

1683.88 --> 1688.3990000000001
just the bards today

1690.6 --> 1696.32
again I'm starting to feel like I'm

1692.96 --> 1698.76
being designated involuntarily as the

1696.32 --> 1701.32
next flat soid or something which I'm

1698.76 --> 1705.279
not going to be I'm not going to

1701.32 --> 1708.12
be a Kindergarten class for

1705.279 --> 1710.6
bards just so you guys know you're

1708.12 --> 1714.36
you're going to have to find some other

1710.6 --> 1714.36
form of life for

1734.919 --> 1740.039
yourselves but by all means pay a visit

1755.32 --> 1758.08
a wellknown

1758.36 --> 1764.36
glober well burn Smith is that is a

1761.84 --> 1765.36
really easy answer for me that would be

1764.36 --> 1770.8799999999999
Alex

1765.36 --> 1770.8799999999999
Jones bro I'd get a freaking with Alex

1771.2 --> 1776.679
Jones I'd probably be a bit disappointed

1774.6 --> 1780.24
because he in reality

1776.679 --> 1783.159
he's likely way more out of

1780.24 --> 1785.919
control than he is as he is like

1783.159 --> 1785.919
performing on

1795.6 --> 1802.039
camera but I I think that I mean the

1800.12 --> 1806.399
point is I think that I can like

1802.039 --> 1809.64
potentially like break Alex's

1806.399 --> 1812.2399999999998
bardism but I mean he'd like have

1809.64 --> 1816.159
infinite hate for me after that

1812.24 --> 1820.6
point he'd probably become obsessed that

1816.159 --> 1824.3600000000001
that is right away typically what does

1820.6 --> 1828.8799999999999
happen when you break a BAL heart and he

1824.36 --> 1828.8799999999999
is one oh my God is he one

1836.159 --> 1842.6000000000001
M oh oh so they have to pick somebody

1839.519 --> 1845.679
super specific oh so it's not Alex Jones

1842.6 --> 1849.1999999999998
is not specific enough I mean dude the

1845.679 --> 1851.1200000000001
guy is like a media guy and he he

1849.2 --> 1853.0800000000002
literally pretended like you need to

1851.12 --> 1855.639
account for Corola effect when you're

1853.08 --> 1859.9189999999999
using a sniper rifle not even like four

1855.639 --> 1859.9189999999999
days ago I mean come on

1866.44 --> 1875.159
I mean I'm not going to do mtune maybe I

1870.919 --> 1877.44
mean he's the least terrible of the

1875.159 --> 1879.3600000000001
standard YouTuber Flat Earth fight the

1877.44 --> 1882.88
Flat Earth no

1879.36 --> 1882.8799999999999
way uh no

1883.88 --> 1893.72
thanks oh my God you can't be serious

1887.919 --> 1893.72
just burns don't don't even go there it

1893.96 --> 1902.1200000000001
is that is just mystifyingly idiotic to

1899.08 --> 1902.12
make a statement like

1905.279 --> 1913.08
that ah okay M good to hear sha Hawkins

1910.399 --> 1915.559
e dude I wouldn't even eat with him in

1913.08 --> 1915.559
the same

1916.0 --> 1919.84
room gross

1944.039 --> 1948.919
right but yeah hey you asked the

1946.12 --> 1950.799
question I gave you the answer

1948.919 --> 1952.96
and it's an answer that I can actually

1950.799 --> 1956.1589999999999
settle with what I have to choose

1952.96 --> 1959.76
something that like I really wouldn't do

1956.159 --> 1962.72
that really sucks why I mean Alex Jones

1959.76 --> 1965.1589999999999
is a freaking Bard

1962.72 --> 1967.96
literally he's like a self-appointed

1965.159 --> 1971.3600000000001
NASA sh

1967.96 --> 1973.8400000000001
guy he takes Bal heartedness to like the

1971.36 --> 1976.799
maximum Boomer level including

1973.84 --> 1979.0
moonlanding justification and all that

1976.799 --> 1982.039
like despite being

1979.0 --> 1986.08
surrounded by Flat Earth adjacent

1982.039 --> 1987.76
researchers that talk about their views

1986.08 --> 1989.9189999999999
and their doubts about the moon landing

1987.76 --> 1992.48
and everything and he's still that

1989.919 --> 1995.1200000000001
Ballard yeah that's a

1992.48 --> 1997.799
Ballard effectively an anti flat earther

1995.12 --> 2000.32
not a very technically apt one but one

1997.799 --> 2003.08
with a relatively good memory but not

2000.32 --> 2004.48
not on a real understanding not that you

2003.08 --> 2007.799
need

2004.48 --> 2009.679
one but yeah I'd have dinner with that

2007.799 --> 2012.84
steak dinner and he's like all about the

2009.679 --> 2012.8400000000001
steak dinners too

2024.519 --> 2030.44
so that's ridiculous that's state I'm

2028.12 --> 2032.36
going to have to delete that that I

2030.44 --> 2034.1200000000001
don't want anybody to see that that's

2032.36 --> 2037.039
just [ __ ] up

2034.12 --> 2039.639
dude I don't know what the hell's what

2037.039 --> 2042.919
your all is there but that's all

2039.639 --> 2042.9189999999999
complete hor

2053.32 --> 2059.48
[ __ ] never seen q and fe's modeling of

2056.76 --> 2059.48
the sun

2062.96 --> 2070.2
no so I'm just going to have this

2066.2 --> 2070.2
overall subject not not get

2071.599 --> 2077.8790000000004
involved okay bur Smithers just keep

2074.56 --> 2080.639
that crazy

2077.879 --> 2083.679
crazy algorithmic

2080.639 --> 2086.079
triggering propaganda nonsense out of my

2083.679 --> 2086.079
chat

2092.879 --> 2100.359
thanks yeah that that situation there

2096.76 --> 2103.88
was about as real as the official

2100.359 --> 2103.88
narrative on 911

2104.44 --> 2108.88
okay that's why

2135.2 --> 2142.52
yeah I mean at the time

2139.079 --> 2143.8
like I was there and watching when all

2142.52 --> 2145.32
of this happened okay I've been

2143.8 --> 2151.04
following Alex

2145.32 --> 2151.04
Jones like on a daily basis since like

2151.68 --> 2158.04
2007 really really in it in 2008

2158.119 --> 2164.8
okay and I mean daily never really

2161.64 --> 2164.7999999999997
stopped not not

2165.079 --> 2171.2000000000003
really I was there when that [ __ ]

2167.599 --> 2174.0
happened and it was terrible why was it

2171.2 --> 2177.72
terrible because the nonsense lie

2174.0 --> 2180.96
machine started to really make moves and

2177.72 --> 2183.04
basically insert nonsense propaganda cuz

2180.96 --> 2185.7200000000003
Alex was

2183.04 --> 2188.72
right and then now he's denying

2185.72 --> 2188.72
everything

2190.16 --> 2194.5989999999997
yeah yeah

2191.68 --> 2197.839
okay

2194.599 --> 2200.839
so one more of that and you're out of

2197.839 --> 2200.839
here

2225.68 --> 2230.0
not allowing messages in chat I'll

2230.359 --> 2235.0
bet and burns here isn't helping with

2233.48 --> 2240.599
his

2235.0 --> 2240.599
statements okay and you're out of here

2243.31 --> 2246.889
[Music]

2257.52 --> 2261.44
yeah I mean this subject is kind of

2259.92 --> 2264.76
forbidden on

2261.44 --> 2268.7200000000003
YouTube and I cannot take a safe

2264.76 --> 2270.7200000000003
position in the face of it so I asked

2268.72 --> 2273.5989999999997
you specifically not to do that and now

2270.72 --> 2276.2
you're banned which is too bad because

2273.599 --> 2278.2400000000002
you seemed like an interesting

2276.2 --> 2282.7999999999997
conversationalist but

2278.24 --> 2286.1189999999997
uh can't seem to let go of mainstream

2282.8 --> 2289.44
uh narrative that is algorithmically

2286.119 --> 2292.7200000000003
triggering so yeah I had to remove you

2289.44 --> 2292.7200000000003
for the safety of my

2293.56 --> 2298.16
channel because I can't just freely

2296.359 --> 2301.0789999999997
express myself about this kind of

2298.16 --> 2304.92
subject without getting into

2301.079 --> 2306.6400000000003
trouble these days which is ridiculous

2304.92 --> 2309.04
because I've already just pretty much

2306.64 --> 2311.4
openly said whatever I wanted to say

2309.04 --> 2311.4
about

2323.0 --> 2330.48
that yeah that entire subject Sandy Hook

2327.04 --> 2334.0
is is just one thing and that's a giant

2330.48 --> 2337.0
free speech trap that's that's what it

2334.0 --> 2337.0
is

2342.119 --> 2347.1600000000003
views are

2344.599 --> 2350.4
glitched hello

2347.16 --> 2351.52
jug don't know exactly what you mean

2350.4 --> 2354.88
could

2351.52 --> 2359.56
be something is screwing this

2354.88 --> 2359.56
up hey blue build evolution

2372.56 --> 2380.7599999999998
are the 911 TR for vide still on

2376.88 --> 2384.2000000000003
you no no they mostly migrated to places

2380.76 --> 2388.3590000000004
that isn't like overtly

2384.2 --> 2388.359
political Free Speech

2390.16 --> 2395.0789999999997
suppressing I mean but there's plenty of

2392.64 --> 2399.0
people that are into 9/11 that are still

2395.079 --> 2399.0
around they just don't

2401.44 --> 2408.119
they don't throw out everything and all

2403.44 --> 2408.119
their views about it and every

2408.72 --> 2412.48
direction or they do it on a separate

2411.0 --> 2415.2
platform it's just like Matt from

2412.48 --> 2417.319
Quantum of conscious does that he has

2415.2 --> 2419.2
still his videos in YouTube and he uses

2417.319 --> 2421.88
some hobo code and all that but if he

2419.2 --> 2425.56
has to get like really up close then he

2421.88 --> 2430.1600000000003
does it on his own website freevoice

2425.56 --> 2430.16
doio so he can say any anything on

2430.52 --> 2436.52
there and he's into 911

2434.0 --> 2438.72
too he like playing those kinds of

2436.52 --> 2440.87
videos just to keep reminding you of

2438.72 --> 2444.0899999999997
what it was

2440.87 --> 2444.0899999999997
[Music]

2449.64 --> 2455.4
like because with everything that's

2452.119 --> 2458.2000000000003
happened to us in the world so at such a

2455.4 --> 2460.6800000000003
rapid Pace you do kind of tend to forget

2458.2 --> 2464.319
you lose the spirit of the time of

2460.68 --> 2466.5989999999997
previous eras of your experience because

2464.319 --> 2466.599
you

2467.48 --> 2471.16
just cuz it's so

2473.76 --> 2478.079
different best 711

2483.599 --> 2487.88
Channel Hey clutch

2489.119 --> 2493.079
anyone who Leeves the official 911

2495.119 --> 2501.8
narrative or clutch it's it's just

2498.52 --> 2501.8
similar to ball

2506.76 --> 2512.2400000000002
belief they're just not ready to accept

2509.76 --> 2515.92
it it's too

2512.24 --> 2518.3999999999996
burdensome to realize that such a

2515.92 --> 2520.2000000000003
trusted thing

2518.4 --> 2522.2000000000003
on which so many people or seem

2520.2 --> 2525.319
psychologically dependent would just

2522.2 --> 2528.16
overtly lie and set up an entire thing

2525.319 --> 2528.16
and try to fool

2528.28 --> 2532.0
everybody like that's too much to handle

2530.68 --> 2534.7599999999998
for some

2532.0 --> 2536.92
people and those people will just say no

2534.76 --> 2540.079
the official story is true and just la

2536.92 --> 2543.76
la la la la la because they can't handle

2540.079 --> 2545.319
that it might be a really brutal setup

2543.76 --> 2548.119
in plain

2545.319 --> 2550.839
sight that's something evil happened

2548.119 --> 2553.599
that Palpatine

2550.839 --> 2555.72
actually was a Sith basically that

2553.599 --> 2558.319
that's the effect they just can't handle

2555.72 --> 2561.24
that Palpatine turned out to be a Sith

2558.319 --> 2563.839
so they're just going to be like nah no

2561.24 --> 2566.2
no it's just made up it's just made up

2563.839 --> 2569.119
by the Jedi or something I

2566.2 --> 2571.8799999999997
mean yeah he has this weird look in his

2569.119 --> 2575.28
eyes and he's always laughing like a

2571.88 --> 2577.359
maniac but I mean he's he's really just

2575.28 --> 2578.6400000000003
he's just really stressed out from the

2577.359 --> 2582.359
burden

2578.64 --> 2586.96
of of just

2582.359 --> 2586.96
yeah having to manage the

2587.119 --> 2593.319
uh the the Republic against all the

2591.0 --> 2595.599
invasions right just yeah that's what

2593.319 --> 2595.599
people

2605.88 --> 2609.119
do uh

2610.44 --> 2615.599
okay reported for hate

2614.0 --> 2618.92
speech

2615.599 --> 2618.92
oh oh

2624.52 --> 2630.2
dear a speech about what I don't even

2628.319 --> 2633.079
know what the [ __ ] you're saying you

2630.2 --> 2633.0789999999997
blabbering

2636.04 --> 2640.079
[ __ ] for

2704.92 --> 2710.52
but but guys I'm serious you know it is

2708.0 --> 2713.72
actually a good mental gymnastics

2710.52 --> 2715.72
practice to think about it

2713.72 --> 2718.839
like

2715.72 --> 2721.7999999999997
mainstream evil narratives that are just

2718.839 --> 2724.7599999999998
obvious lies and all that and how people

2721.8 --> 2727.8
like can't handle that that happened so

2724.76 --> 2731.1600000000003
they have to justify it

2727.8 --> 2733.6800000000003
as a practice just think of it like with

2731.16 --> 2734.839
the end of the Republic and the Empire

2733.68 --> 2738.0789999999997
with

2734.839 --> 2740.16
Palpatine and then just think of it like

2738.079 --> 2743.44
you're a citizen in the

2740.16 --> 2747.0789999999997
Republic and like everything is been

2743.44 --> 2747.079
kind of messy and since

2747.8 --> 2753.92
the since the Clone soldiers came in

2750.96 --> 2756.559
more and like there has been more order

2753.92 --> 2760.28
less crime and but people are pissed off

2756.559 --> 2763.48
and like yeah I mean but the Empire

2760.28 --> 2767.52
brings stability they really do in a way

2763.48 --> 2767.52
it's not as free but they do bring that

2771.48 --> 2777.079
stability and I mean they're just really

2773.64 --> 2779.8799999999997
uptight I mean yeah they get kind of

2777.079 --> 2782.88
nail like or whatever but I mean they

2779.88 --> 2786.1600000000003
just have to do what they have to do to

2782.88 --> 2787.88
to stay ahead of the those damn Rebels

2786.16 --> 2790.0789999999997
you know

2787.88 --> 2792.7200000000003
and I mean if you'd be the leader of all

2790.079 --> 2794.6800000000003
of that yeah you'd be completely nuts

2792.72 --> 2798.0
too like Palpatine I mean give the old

2794.68 --> 2800.1189999999997
man a break man he's got the entire

2798.0 --> 2805.559
universe against

2800.119 --> 2808.28
him you'd go crazy and all that too like

2805.559 --> 2811.44
I I'd personally go all

2808.28 --> 2814.48
maniacal just just as a precautionary

2811.44 --> 2818.76
defensive measure just to intimidate any

2814.48 --> 2818.76
opponents that might get any idea

2818.92 --> 2827.559
right I mean he's really not that bad a

2823.04 --> 2827.5589999999997
guy he can't be

2847.28 --> 2854.0
come on F don't have to get into the

2850.04 --> 2857.359
details but yeah yeah 911 is a mess that

2854.0 --> 2857.359
entire day is just

2859.8 --> 2864.2000000000003
insane right and the biggest ones are

2862.64 --> 2865.8799999999997
where they

2864.2 --> 2868.64
actually

2865.88 --> 2871.0
report on building and I was there when

2868.64 --> 2874.04
it happened I have that memory like from

2871.0 --> 2878.16
the live view on the TV because I was

2874.04 --> 2880.96
clustered to the television at the time

2878.16 --> 2880.96
2001

2881.599 --> 2890.319
September like that day was a

2886.16 --> 2890.319
mess but that evening

2892.559 --> 2896.6800000000003
like they mentioned like there was this

2895.319 --> 2900.92
video going

2896.68 --> 2902.8799999999997
around of CNN reporter standing in front

2900.92 --> 2905.28
like with the camera pointed at building

2902.88 --> 2907.6400000000003
s and that she reported how it had

2905.28 --> 2910.7200000000003
collapsed when it was still standing

2907.64 --> 2910.72
there in the background

2911.48 --> 2917.64
smoking

2913.48 --> 2917.64
yeah I mean

2917.68 --> 2923.3999999999996
bro that was the like the weirdest thing

2920.839 --> 2926.96
ever that that happened like that really

2923.4 --> 2929.28
showed like uh this is all like planned

2926.96 --> 2932.04
or something like they're getting heads

2929.28 --> 2935.4
up of things that aren't even happening

2932.04 --> 2938.079
yet that's like something really fishy

2935.4 --> 2940.04
going on like that was the real trigger

2938.079 --> 2941.7200000000003
for me to to notice like there's

2940.04 --> 2944.48
something really wrong here I hadn't

2941.72 --> 2946.359
even considered about like structure

2944.48 --> 2947.76
Integrity of steel frame buildings and

2946.359 --> 2951.119
all that I haven't even thought about

2947.76 --> 2954.5200000000004
any of that but just like that reporter

2951.119 --> 2957.88
just like hey building s has collapsed

2954.52 --> 2963.16
like uh it's literally right behind you

2957.88 --> 2963.1600000000003
in on camera what are you talking about

2963.24 --> 2969.2
woman and then later it did collapse

2965.799 --> 2969.2
like totally

2979.799 --> 2984.799
nuts how about the two trillion yeah

2982.88 --> 2987.48
there was apparently in building seven

2984.799 --> 2990.2
this under the in the basement

2987.48 --> 2992.96
somewhere and this is kind of vague by

2990.2 --> 2995.5989999999997
now but that that was playing out that

2992.96 --> 2998.559
apparently there were billions in gold

2995.599 --> 3002.44
reserves like stored at in the basement

2998.559 --> 3004.28
of basement 7 that all disappeared and

3002.44 --> 3006.92
weirdly enough there was even like this

3004.28 --> 3010.3590000000004
weird movie made about

3006.92 --> 3012.079
this and how that was stolen like I

3010.359 --> 3017.04
think that was even that movie was

3012.079 --> 3019.6400000000003
before 911 it it was all just so

3017.04 --> 3021.64
freaky and yeah that just disappeared

3019.64 --> 3024.5989999999997
like it all just disappear like the gold

3021.64 --> 3029.68
just disintegrated when the building

3024.599 --> 3029.6800000000003
went down free fall for

3065.4 --> 3069.44
yeah that was some crazy

3073.2 --> 3080.5989999999997
[ __ ] but uh yeah again to the to get it

3076.68 --> 3083.319
back yeah I definitely have a stake with

3080.599 --> 3086.319
a baller of my choice and I choose Alex

3083.319 --> 3086.319
Jones

3110.76 --> 3115.119
and I just like what would probably

3113.04 --> 3118.599
happen with him is that he would get

3115.119 --> 3121.599
very triggered right way but I'm let I'd

3118.599 --> 3124.3590000000004
let him do it all of it and I'd

3121.599 --> 3126.88
basically respond to every damn thing he

3124.359 --> 3129.04
would say like every damn thing until he

3126.88 --> 3130.7200000000003
realizes like you're just you have a

3129.04 --> 3133.64
response to everything I say don't you

3130.72 --> 3133.64
and then I say

3134.72 --> 3141.839
yes are you noticing The Logical

3137.68 --> 3141.839
consistency of my answers

3151.2 --> 3157.2799999999997
and I I Tred to explain to him like do

3153.64 --> 3159.8799999999997
you know what presuppositions are right

3157.28 --> 3162.3190000000004
to actually understand the fabric of

3159.88 --> 3162.319
what he's

3166.2 --> 3171.96
doing so maybe he could intellectually

3169.559 --> 3173.88
go to the next level with that just

3171.96 --> 3175.92
being able to do

3173.88 --> 3178.1600000000003
that doesn't mean that he's then going

3175.92 --> 3180.2400000000002
to change his ways but at least if he's

3178.16 --> 3183.72
able to do that then he

3180.24 --> 3183.72
has some

3183.78 --> 3186.9390000000003
[Music]

3197.799 --> 3201.48
options what the hell are

3202.4 --> 3210.4
you yeah there's no need to get gross

3206.68 --> 3210.3999999999996
guys please

3243.64 --> 3250.4
just you're a repulsive individual

3245.88 --> 3250.4
debatable D you really are I

3253.079 --> 3256.799
mean just what you

3260.44 --> 3265.76
do [ __ ]

3262.68 --> 3268.359
knuckle what did I do now you were just

3265.76 --> 3268.3590000000004
yourself

3280.599 --> 3285.28
gay wow indeed

3291.839 --> 3297.4
yeah I mean you as a standard tactic use

3296.4 --> 3303.2400000000002
gr

3297.4 --> 3303.2400000000002
out as a defensive mechanism that's

3305.88 --> 3312.6400000000003
gay

3307.96 --> 3316.16
yeah it's kind of definitive that that's

3312.64 --> 3319.64
gay you do that you're very unrepining

3316.16 --> 3325.72
about that you seem to be very

3319.64 --> 3325.72
comfortable with doing that you're gay

3327.64 --> 3331.179
[Music]

3334.44 --> 3338.799
I said

3335.559 --> 3341.96
nothing yeah no no no

3338.799 --> 3344.559
no you did though yeah you you're

3341.96 --> 3345.839
bringing the attention very specifically

3344.559 --> 3348.079
into a

3345.839 --> 3349.359
direction yeah you highlight somebody

3348.079 --> 3352.599
else's

3349.359 --> 3353.64
words that have a very specific meaning

3352.599 --> 3357.6400000000003
to

3353.64 --> 3360.319
them and then you trans form that and

3357.64 --> 3365.48
then highlight something that is gay and

3360.319 --> 3365.48
gross cuz that's what you do debatable

3372.319 --> 3380.4
D that's your convenient exit

3376.0 --> 3383.52
strategy to keep yourself safe like to

3380.4 --> 3387.48
make other people dim

3383.52 --> 3391.88
down cuz you're completely unfaced by

3387.48 --> 3391.88
that kind of thing cuz you're gay

3419.599 --> 3426.559
yes yes yes I know debatable I know you

3422.92 --> 3428.319
like the you is others as an excuse to

3426.559 --> 3431.44
do that kind of thing so you can then

3428.319 --> 3431.44
blame it all on

3434.799 --> 3439.559
them I know how that works

3449.48 --> 3454.839
if you were not

3451.599 --> 3458.3590000000004
gay you would just say wow

3454.839 --> 3463.119
that's that's gross and

3458.359 --> 3465.48
then not build upon that to continue the

3463.119 --> 3467.4
conversation in that direction something

3465.48 --> 3470.2400000000002
that you don't do

3467.4 --> 3473.52
the now if somebody does that you're

3470.24 --> 3476.319
definitely going to use that and amplify

3473.52 --> 3478.0389999999998
it and then gross people out with it

3476.319 --> 3480.2
because you're just very comfortable

3478.039 --> 3482.48
with that and you know how subduing that

3480.2 --> 3483.96
is to other people that are not super

3482.48 --> 3487.839
comfortable with it because they're not

3483.96 --> 3487.839
gay like you

3525.799 --> 3531.079
right yeah see you later fiber thanks

3527.559 --> 3531.079
for being there

3549.76 --> 3554.96
okay Evolution it's good to have you

3552.559 --> 3554.96
here in

3561.76 --> 3568.599
chat see here he goes you see right

3565.88 --> 3568.599
there on the

3569.2 --> 3572.96
spot right there on the

3580.039 --> 3586.76
spot you did it again it's so second

3583.52 --> 3588.559
nature to you it's so second nature you

3586.76 --> 3592.96
don't even know when you're doing it

3588.559 --> 3592.96
debatable debatable d

3604.0 --> 3607.0
that

3654.28 --> 3661.2000000000003
cuz nothing is ever correct

3657.88 --> 3663.44
oh did I ever guys did I ever say the b

3661.2 --> 3666.3999999999996
d is doing something wrong I'm just

3663.44 --> 3666.4
pointing out what you

3667.359 --> 3674.88
do you're the one that's automatically

3671.359 --> 3674.88
assuming that what you're doing is

3680.599 --> 3687.92
wrong although gay behavior in general

3684.52 --> 3687.92
is not right

3692.4 --> 3698.44
it's just a little bit elusive can't

3696.039 --> 3701.88
just

3698.44 --> 3706.64
basically correct somebody's

3701.88 --> 3709.6400000000003
internal emotional social chemistry like

3706.64 --> 3713.279
that they have to decide

3709.64 --> 3716.48
it they decide to be disciplined and

3713.279 --> 3719.68
basically to change their character

3716.48 --> 3721.839
that takes a lot of effort

3719.68 --> 3724.48
though I'm not assuming you're going to

3721.839 --> 3724.48
do any of

3734.64 --> 3739.799
that

3736.48 --> 3744.64
oh oh you're going to flip it around are

3739.799 --> 3744.64
you oh that's to be expected

3746.01 --> 3749.1690000000003
[Music]

3752.5 --> 3755.869
[Music]

3760.01 --> 3763.9390000000003
[Music]

3787.52 --> 3793.0
could be Moxy I mean I just pay

3790.599 --> 3796.039
attention I just pay attention to these

3793.0 --> 3796.039
patterns and that's

3799.68 --> 3805.0389999999998
it people usually don't pay that much of

3803.359 --> 3806.96
much attention to their their own

3805.039 --> 3809.2400000000002
patterns

3806.96 --> 3812.279
because they're just using them to yield

3809.24 --> 3814.52
certain things and I pay attention to

3812.279 --> 3818.24
how that

3814.52 --> 3822.88
works let to strive for a more conscious

3818.24 --> 3822.8799999999997
grasp on these types of actions

3863.24 --> 3868.64
yeah and hey yeah some of the mods may

3866.0 --> 3872.0
say gross gay things at times but it's

3868.64 --> 3874.5589999999997
the context it's how they're saying it

3872.0 --> 3877.44
are they immediately going to continue

3874.559 --> 3880.44
doing that is it like oh somebody

3877.44 --> 3883.52
finally opened the door to gross and gay

3880.44 --> 3886.7200000000003
oh finally I can be in my element like

3883.52 --> 3889.44
the way that you work cuz you're very

3886.72 --> 3891.16
comfortable with that when somebody says

3889.44 --> 3893.16
something gross and gay you see it as

3891.16 --> 3894.319
like oh it's good you we can come out of

3893.16 --> 3898.16
the closet

3894.319 --> 3902.2
now we can just be like

3898.16 --> 3905.72
that while they say it to specifically

3902.2 --> 3908.319
dump Express themselves in a certain

3905.72 --> 3911.9199999999996
way and you do it one time you don't

3908.319 --> 3914.88
keep going with it CU they aren't seeing

3911.92 --> 3914.88
that as

3916.119 --> 3921.6800000000003
normal so they don't have that response

3919.52 --> 3924.68
to somebody saying like something like

3921.68 --> 3926.64
that is the oh that's that's our cue to

3924.68 --> 3931.0389999999998
come out of the closet and just be gross

3926.64 --> 3931.0389999999998
and gay like you debatable

3947.319 --> 3952.2
D and this is all about behavioral

3952.559 --> 3957.2000000000003
mechanics behavioral consistency

3957.72 --> 3961.839
getting to face people and their

3959.52 --> 3965.72
behavior on a daily basis

3961.839 --> 3968.359
for months and

3965.72 --> 3972.68
years if you have a particular talent

3968.359 --> 3972.68
for it you start to pick up on certain

3980.4 --> 3985.559
consistencies doing it again see

3985.96 --> 3992.4
what you just said

3989.279 --> 3995.799
again like you're lit what you're doing

3992.4 --> 4000.0
now is like what gay teasing

3995.799 --> 4002.0
is you're not denying you're gay you're

4000.0 --> 4006.119
saying like yeah I will stay in that

4002.0 --> 4009.4
closet oh so you are actually gay then

4006.119 --> 4009.4
see you can't help

4010.839 --> 4014.16
yourself it's because it's second nature

4013.24 --> 4017.5989999999997
to

4014.16 --> 4020.68
you you just have all this Dynamic and

4017.599 --> 4025.039
freedom of creativity within that

4020.68 --> 4025.0389999999998
frequency because you're

4041.88 --> 4049.0
gay see with your gay winky face like

4045.119 --> 4051.279
everything that you do every time is gay

4049.0 --> 4051.279
and

4064.72 --> 4070.359
gross yeah I mean people use smiley

4067.599 --> 4072.039
faces and all that all over the place

4070.359 --> 4074.2
sometimes not so

4072.039 --> 4077.279
much when you do

4074.2 --> 4082.9199999999996
it more more than half the times you do

4077.279 --> 4082.92
it it's gay the way you use it is

4090.76 --> 4099.4400000000005
gay I mean sometimes you actually as a

4094.48 --> 4102.199
supposed man use like the the winky

4099.44 --> 4106.3189999999995
kissy heart

4102.199 --> 4109.08
smiley there is literally no emo C a a

4106.319 --> 4111.64
man could use that would signify their

4109.08 --> 4115.799
gay status more than that

4111.64 --> 4119.52
one there's literally no excuse for that

4115.799 --> 4122.719
there's no logical justification for

4119.52 --> 4126.400000000001
using that one ever and you seem to be

4122.719 --> 4129.92
very comfortable second nature level

4126.4 --> 4129.92
using that

4157.64 --> 4161.4800000000005
wait what am I talking about

4167.839 --> 4170.759
God are you talking

4172.839 --> 4177.04
about the the whole Kennedy

4182.279 --> 4187.759
thing I mean that entire situation is

4185.279 --> 4187.759
such a

4188.48 --> 4194.919999999999
mess I mean it's that operation is like

4192.239 --> 4197.32
a layer under a layer under a layer I

4194.92 --> 4197.32
mean

4202.719 --> 4208.08
maybe it would surprise you that I'm one

4204.679 --> 4209.84
of those people that thinks that when

4208.08 --> 4213.04
something is a layer under a layer under

4209.84 --> 4217.96
a layer type of situation it's become so

4213.04 --> 4220.56
convoluted that as a gambled idea or

4217.96 --> 4222.88
rule of fist almost like the most

4220.56 --> 4226.52
unlikely unexpected

4222.88 --> 4228.84
thing is probably true

4226.52 --> 4231.159000000001
so I think that Kennedy is probably

4228.84 --> 4231.159000000001
still

4247.719 --> 4252.8
alive he might be like this weird Shadow

4250.88 --> 4256.6
operator

4252.8 --> 4259.08
like sort of an uncle friend or whatever

4256.6 --> 4261.2390000000005
but that's actually him and he just

4259.08 --> 4264.08
still hangs around the family and

4261.239 --> 4267.28
everything like that's what I

4264.08 --> 4269.96
think and yeah there's no point really

4267.28 --> 4271.28
to like oh I'm not going to defend that

4269.96 --> 4274.4800000000005
position

4271.28 --> 4276.5599999999995
or understand or yeah or fight against

4274.48 --> 4278.44
anybody who thinks that that's nonsense

4276.56 --> 4281.76
because like yeah

4278.44 --> 4286.4
I but I it just the whole thing seemed

4281.76 --> 4286.400000000001
like it was like too convoluted

4304.71 --> 4307.92
[Music]

4314.0 --> 4320.88
yeah debatable d you're

4317.36 --> 4322.799999999999
gay I know you're very okay with what

4320.88 --> 4325.76
you do and why you do it and you can

4322.8 --> 4325.76
justify it

4326.159 --> 4333.36
but it's that justification doesn't make

4330.88 --> 4337.0
it not

4333.36 --> 4342.0
gay it's about the whole it's about the

4337.0 --> 4342.0
whole set of how you do things

4365.84 --> 4370.76
right

4367.8 --> 4373.400000000001
anyway kind of a weird show

4370.76 --> 4375.639
today and I don't want to keep talking

4373.4 --> 4378.5599999999995
about how gay debatable D is it is

4375.639 --> 4381.76
getting a bit tedious I mean anybody

4378.56 --> 4384.1990000000005
that hasn't picked up on

4381.76 --> 4387.320000000001
that after everything that I've already

4384.199 --> 4391.159
said like you got a problem then your

4387.32 --> 4393.84
gar is like completely fried probably

4391.159 --> 4396.28
Overexposed to Too Much gay pretending

4393.84 --> 4398.159000000001
not to be gay and flipping everything

4396.28 --> 4399.759999999999
inside out and then you don't notice and

4398.159 --> 4402.36
you're like what's wrong with debatable

4399.76 --> 4406.6
D he like a perfectly normal

4402.36 --> 4409.92
guy I wears he I bet he wears is like

4406.6 --> 4412.4400000000005
children's pajamas just like every man

4409.92 --> 4417.08
that I hang around with

4412.44 --> 4417.08
like yeah that might be your comment

4418.04 --> 4421.96
right if you think that he's

4422.239 --> 4427.959999999999
normal like yeah that's cuz you're gay

4445.81 --> 4448.909000000001
[Music]

4512.199 --> 4519.919999999999
right what the hell were we talking

4515.92 --> 4522.52
about this got completely sent into the

4519.92 --> 4526.679
weeds oh

4522.52 --> 4529.76
yeah that guy who was went all nuts over

4526.679 --> 4533.32
Sandy Hook for some reason because I

4529.76 --> 4533.320000000001
mentioned Alex Jones when he

4533.96 --> 4539.56
asked what baller would you or what what

4537.12 --> 4539.5599999999995
did he

4540.88 --> 4547.32
say what Globe believer would I have a

4544.6 --> 4552.4800000000005
steak dinner with apparently saying Alex

4547.32 --> 4552.48
Jones was just like this wrong answer or

4553.56 --> 4559.159000000001
something cuz like yeah there's other

4556.32 --> 4562.599999999999
people I'm definitely not going to do

4559.159 --> 4564.48
that like why would I but I mean I'd

4562.6 --> 4568.360000000001
have a steak dinner with Alex

4564.48 --> 4572.08
Jones and then just

4568.36 --> 4574.839999999999
like I just be very curious

4572.08 --> 4580.5599999999995
how alert he would

4574.84 --> 4585.639
be how how rattled his ball tartness

4580.56 --> 4585.639
would be in my presence

4595.12 --> 4601.239
so that would actually be something that

4597.239 --> 4601.239
I I I would do

4636.32 --> 4640.0
but apparently that's not the

4637.8 --> 4643.1990000000005
conversation

4640.0 --> 4643.199
anymore oh

4643.84 --> 4647.88
well for

4675.85 --> 4678.979
[Music]

4682.159 --> 4686.159
let's see what's happening out there in

4683.84 --> 4689.400000000001
the world there's a lot of crazy [ __ ]

4686.159 --> 4689.4
going on

4714.239 --> 4719.4
wow that's pretty intense

4745.639 --> 4750.08
Yeah just something about the Dutch

4748.199 --> 4753.5599999999995
government

4750.08 --> 4756.92
like there's all this these

4753.56 --> 4760.8
motions from the chamber basically that

4756.92 --> 4763.76
are just that the the missionary cabinet

4760.8 --> 4765.4800000000005
and everything is just not doing even

4763.76 --> 4768.1990000000005
though they basically been ordered to do

4765.48 --> 4772.04
it and they're just not doing it that's

4768.199 --> 4775.32
been apparently quite a list

4772.04 --> 4778.679
since December

4775.32 --> 4783.599999999999
6th I haven't really watched the video

4778.679 --> 4783.6
but I mean they're yeah they're just

4783.76 --> 4787.679
not they're not doing

4788.08 --> 4794.12
it making the the government structure

4791.88 --> 4796.400000000001
basically ineffective it's like broken

4794.12 --> 4799.04
because

4796.4 --> 4800.599999999999
one part of the government is just not

4799.04 --> 4804.5199999999995
performing its

4800.6 --> 4804.52
function that's happening here in the

4805.159 --> 4811.879999999999
nland these people like politically

4808.199 --> 4816.32
refuse to do their jobs and somehow get

4811.88 --> 4816.32
away with it it's crazy

4828.52 --> 4832.639
yeah the Iranian president thing yeah

4838.8 --> 4843.4800000000005
that's that's a thing indeed

4876.679 --> 4881.719
it's whole talk

4878.76 --> 4885.1990000000005
talk yeah the bable D

4881.719 --> 4887.96
perhaps but I mean when

4885.199 --> 4890.5199999999995
when motions are done and

4887.96 --> 4893.92
then the next step in the government

4890.52 --> 4897.56
they're not doing

4893.92 --> 4898.719
it that is a problem though and it's a

4897.56 --> 4901.0
problem that's going to continue

4898.719 --> 4904.28
building and it's like yeah what are

4901.0 --> 4904.28
what is actually going to be

4905.239 --> 4910.5599999999995
done about dysfunctional organs within

4908.92 --> 4915.1990000000005
the government when they're just not

4910.56 --> 4915.1990000000005
doing what they're supposed to be doing

4915.44 --> 4920.678999999999
how is that going to be

4917.76 --> 4924.84
stopped there has to be something that

4920.679 --> 4924.84
will just make that

4927.8 --> 4936.320000000001
stop otherwise like any part of the

4933.199 --> 4939.839999999999
government can just get in there decide

4936.32 --> 4941.5599999999995
to disobey and then just make the entire

4939.84 --> 4943.88
government

4941.56 --> 4946.1990000000005
dysfunctional by just not following the

4943.88 --> 4949.1990000000005
rules without any consequences I mean

4946.199 --> 4949.199
that has to

4968.88 --> 4973.159000000001
stop 35 watching

4973.44 --> 4977.48
wow for

5028.84 --> 5032.4400000000005
right I'm going to take a two-minute

5030.12 --> 5036.44

back right oh God it's just YouTu

5335.8 --> 5342.28
okay let's talk about

5339.76 --> 5344.159000000001
something maybe I'm just going to time

5342.28 --> 5348.199
you two out because I don't want to hear

5344.159 --> 5350.48
you anymore it's just you two are just

5348.199 --> 5352.36
gross want to talk about something

5350.48 --> 5355.28
that's

5352.36 --> 5359.159
interesting not about how freaking gay

5355.28 --> 5359.159
de bable D is

5364.719 --> 5369.88
idiotically skeptic MOX is about

5368.04 --> 5373.679
anything that doubts the official

5369.88 --> 5373.679
stories about anything

5400.88 --> 5408.8
slak Minister he's not

5405.76 --> 5412.2390000000005
dead as far as I've heard unless he

5408.8 --> 5412.2390000000005
recently died I don't think

5422.96 --> 5426.96
so for

5457.76 --> 5463.639
no if that were the case I definitely it

5461.119 --> 5466.96
would definitely

5463.639 --> 5469.119
be over the news right now if that were

5466.96 --> 5469.119
the

5478.159 --> 5482.159
case let me check some other

5482.92 --> 5486.88
sources for

5522.239 --> 5529.959999999999
nope no he he's still alive but he was

5525.96 --> 5529.96
in critical condition last time I

5533.28 --> 5538.159
heard so he's probably wounded to a

5535.96 --> 5541.32
level that he's not going to be the

5538.159 --> 5544.4
same like he's probably not going to be

5541.32 --> 5545.679
back the way he used to be kind of

5544.4 --> 5549.4
wounded

5545.679 --> 5549.4
unfortunately but he's not

5572.84 --> 5575.84
dead

5602.76 --> 5606.76
for for

5640.84 --> 5644.52

deeply into esoterics

6102.159 --> 6109.08
the and this happened stupid mainstream

6106.44 --> 6111.839999999999
[ __ ] potential and traing and it just

6109.08 --> 6114.32
completely blocked

6111.84 --> 6117.400000000001
everything now I feel like I'm just

6114.32 --> 6117.4
stuck with you

6121.76 --> 6128.4400000000005
guys yeah not you included clutch I mean

6125.199 --> 6131.159

6128.44 --> 6134.32
outs and this been good to have blue

6131.159 --> 6134.32
pill Devolution

6135.48 --> 6141.159
around blue pill you do seem to pop up

6138.92 --> 6143.679
specifically when I'm like in the middle

6141.159 --> 6146.2
of a lot of friction

6143.679 --> 6147.639
no that is standing High to

6146.2 --> 6151.159
[Music]

6147.639 --> 6154.0
me like when the things when action

6151.159 --> 6157.4
starts to happen that's when you tend to

6154.0 --> 6157.4
pop up kind of

6159.08 --> 6165.679
typical but it's good to have you on my

6161.36 --> 6165.679
side at least with that

6176.119 --> 6179.239
get tired of

6184.34 --> 6187.459
[Music]

6190.43 --> 6193.669
[Music]

6199.48 --> 6206.08
yeah I just need to dig into some kind

6202.159 --> 6206.08
of subject for

6241.08 --> 6244.08
for

6254.03 --> 6257.37
[Music]

6285.199 --> 6289.759999999999
us she have to catch a yeah bloo I

6287.32 --> 6292.5199999999995
thought something like that it's all

6289.76 --> 6295.360000000001
right I'm just like not super focused

6292.52 --> 6295.360000000001
today for some

6299.44 --> 6309.199
reason there's a lot of like talk and

6303.159 --> 6309.199
articles about how it really does seem

6309.599 --> 6314.599
like the government here in the

6312.4 --> 6318.28
Netherlands is just out of like it's

6314.599 --> 6322.639
really out of control like

6318.28 --> 6324.36
literally out of control no no logical

6322.639 --> 6328.84
control on it

6324.36 --> 6328.839999999999
anymore people are getting politically

6329.32 --> 6333.759999999999
persecuted in a very hypocritical

6334.76 --> 6342.2390000000005
way while that government that's doing

6337.639 --> 6345.159000000001
that basically is just ignoring

6342.239 --> 6348.159
orders that they're obligated

6345.159 --> 6348.159
to

6348.36 --> 6352.639
uh to perform

6362.36 --> 6369.719
so you got to wonder like what what now

6365.239 --> 6369.718999999999
what what what do you do with all this

6380.05 --> 6383.119000000001
[Music]

6387.04 --> 6391.76
I mean what what do you do about

6398.159 --> 6404.638999999999
that who is getting politically

6400.44 --> 6409.4
persecuted people who are speaking out

6404.639 --> 6409.400000000001
against immigration policy

6415.199 --> 6422.199
so yeah people I mean it it's happening

6419.52 --> 6422.1990000000005
all over the

6422.92 --> 6428.56
place I mean that's just one I mean the

6426.159 --> 6431.4
amount of motions that have not been

6428.56 --> 6433.56
executed by the

6431.4 --> 6436.0
government even though they are

6433.56 --> 6439.52
obligated

6436.0 --> 6441.36
to like that is the biggest problem is

6439.52 --> 6443.1990000000005
that they're just not doing what they're

6441.36 --> 6445.5599999999995
supposed to be doing but I mean

6443.199 --> 6448.04
political persecution of people that are

6445.56 --> 6452.360000000001
criticizing

6448.04 --> 6456.119
policy like under the guise of racism or

6452.36 --> 6457.679
whatever they're persecuted like that is

6456.119 --> 6461.0
just super

6457.679 --> 6461.0
hypocritical and

6461.96 --> 6468.2390000000005
terrible but yeah the the missionary

6465.04 --> 6471.159
cabinet just not fulfilling their

6468.239 --> 6473.28
obligations that is like the worst part

6471.159 --> 6475.638999999999
of all of it

6473.28 --> 6478.199
that they're effectively blocking

6475.639 --> 6478.1990000000005
government

6478.8 --> 6486.4800000000005
development based on political parties

6482.44 --> 6490.879999999999
that are yeah playing out their

6486.48 --> 6490.879999999999
roles based on the people's

6494.56 --> 6502.8
will and Common

6497.599 --> 6502.8

6515.639 --> 6520.679
yeah blue build Evolution and I'm just

6517.599 --> 6520.679
so sick of it

6522.92 --> 6529.32
I'm I mean when people are just openly

6526.92 --> 6533.32
hostile openly

6529.32 --> 6533.32
treacherous like

6534.52 --> 6540.0
how are we even capable of continuing on

6537.56 --> 6544.639
without

6540.0 --> 6544.639
having a proper response to

6548.84 --> 6554.32
that like where are The Gallows where

6552.32 --> 6556.719
are the shooting

6554.32 --> 6559.719
ranges

6556.719 --> 6559.719
like

6560.599 --> 6565.76
treachery like kind of open open and

6563.28 --> 6565.759999999999
obvious

6566.08 --> 6570.32
treachery

6567.76 --> 6571.8
like treachery is just going to be

6570.32 --> 6575.599
normalized

6571.8 --> 6579.4800000000005
now so screw cohesion

6575.599 --> 6583.32
screw the rule of people entirely it's

6579.48 --> 6583.32
like yeah you just lose

6583.56 --> 6588.84
everything because there's no

6585.32 --> 6591.4
consequences to

6588.84 --> 6594.639
treachery like treachery is like one of

6591.4 --> 6594.638999999999
the worst

6594.8 --> 6599.04
crimes possible of

6600.119 --> 6606.32
government that's why in like every

6603.76 --> 6610.52
military tradition ever in history

6606.32 --> 6610.5199999999995
treachery is always punished with

6613.44 --> 6617.36
death yeah it has a good

6619.48 --> 6625.959999999999
reason but yeah if if there is no more

6623.36 --> 6630.04
punishment to treachery

6625.96 --> 6630.04
than then there's nothing

6630.56 --> 6635.4400000000005
left then there's only Decay and

6633.719 --> 6638.44
Corruption

6635.44 --> 6641.759999999999
left if treachery will not be punished

6638.44 --> 6641.759999999999
with death

6642.37 --> 6645.5599999999995
[Music]

6672.76 --> 6679.639
I mean there's a reason why treachery is

6676.36 --> 6681.32
punished by death

6679.639 --> 6685.0
historically

6681.32 --> 6688.239
cuz you could probably point at a few

6685.0 --> 6692.04
occasions where that did not happen

6688.239 --> 6696.839999999999
historically and that led then probably

6692.04 --> 6696.84
mostly to the fall of that Empire or

6705.199 --> 6711.04
Kingdom I mean that response to

6708.679 --> 6715.8
treachery is apparently so important

6711.04 --> 6716.84
that even an outside force or Army and

6715.8 --> 6721.88
an

6716.84 --> 6724.32
opponent they might bribe or

6721.88 --> 6726.639
whatever certain individuals to

6724.32 --> 6729.44
basically open the gates for them as

6726.639 --> 6731.679
their army arrived that kind of thing

6729.44 --> 6735.079
well those

6731.679 --> 6739.679
traitors once the opponent has won and

6735.079 --> 6744.04
taken over almost always get

6739.679 --> 6746.96
killed why as it prec cautionary

6744.04 --> 6749.32
measure

6746.96 --> 6752.4
because they're

6749.32 --> 6755.4
Traders and now they

6752.4 --> 6757.96
are people that have committed treachery

6755.4 --> 6761.759999999999
that are supposedly on your side the

6757.96 --> 6764.679
risk of them D

6761.76 --> 6768.719
stabilizing the real yeah your

6764.679 --> 6772.92
power per default just by their history

6768.719 --> 6775.159
and it being known is like too big risk

6772.92 --> 6777.2390000000005
to take and that's why they usually all

6775.159 --> 6781.44
get

6777.239 --> 6786.239
killed that's how much weight there

6781.44 --> 6788.759999999999
is on the necessity to punish

6786.239 --> 6790.839999999999
treachery that even if a traitor is on

6788.76 --> 6792.1990000000005
your side you still kill them because

6790.84 --> 6795.56
they're

6792.199 --> 6798.199
traitors yeah that I mean this is

6795.56 --> 6803.4800000000005
freaking history in plain sight and

6798.199 --> 6803.48
we're just letting them all do it

6842.8 --> 6847.0
are in the government that are not

obviously

6847.0 --> 6851.88
traitors traitors to the nation to

6849.639 --> 6855.719

6869.079 --> 6875.4
people that are blatantly conspiring to

6876.4 --> 6883.5599999999995
betray those that they are assigned to

6881.199 --> 6886.799999999999

traitors to the people that they're

6886.8 --> 6889.8
managing

6892.76 --> 6898.0
right you just need to get rid of that

6896.0 --> 6901.44
and then have people in there that'll

6898.0 --> 6904.0
just do their damn jobs as you're

6901.44 --> 6906.54
supposed to and not

6904.0 --> 6908.96

6908.96 --> 6915.96
Traer that's

6912.04 --> 6918.079
it yeah you have that then you have a

6915.96 --> 6920.92
properly functioning government and then

6918.079 --> 6923.96
things are great just look at Russia

6920.92 --> 6927.4800000000005
right now

6923.96 --> 6930.4800000000005
yeah it has a extensive government it's

6927.48 --> 6932.0
doing a really great job comparatively I

6930.48 --> 6934.159
mean it's not perfect and they still

6932.0 --> 6936.36
have issues there's always going to be

6934.159 --> 6939.5599999999995
issues like no matter what the situation

6936.36 --> 6939.5599999999995
is how big or how

6939.599 --> 6946.159000000001
small a nation is

6942.84 --> 6950.079
right but they're very functional and

6946.159 --> 6952.598999999999
the people in it like really make

6950.079 --> 6954.92
effort they make effort in their

6952.599 --> 6957.719
language in their decision making

6954.92 --> 6959.4400000000005
structure they have a good trust toward

6957.719 --> 6963.159
each other and there's good social

6959.44 --> 6965.36
control within the government it's very

6963.159 --> 6967.92
functional probably one of the least

6965.36 --> 6972.92
corrupted

6967.92 --> 6977.639
governments in the modern world right

6972.92 --> 6977.639
now it's not going to be imperious

6978.04 --> 6983.56
though nothing really

6980.4 --> 6985.48
is but they they do their best right

6983.56 --> 6990.0
that's a government that's how you want

6985.48 --> 6993.678999999999
it to be like other nations are jealous

6990.0 --> 6997.0
of how well the Russian government

6993.679 --> 6997.0
functions I'm

7000.239 --> 7005.879999999999
jealous yeah that's right is an example

7003.8 --> 7009.56
least corrupted

7005.88 --> 7013.56
absolutely most functional

7009.56 --> 7013.56
government absolutely

7014.239 --> 7018.959999999999
yeah everybody that is in the government

7016.56 --> 7024.1990000000005
there does what they're actually

7018.96 --> 7024.199
assigned to do and they do their

7029.88 --> 7038.04
best and treason the idea of it even is

7034.32 --> 7038.04
properly terrifying to

7039.48 --> 7043.919999999999
them which it should

7044.199 --> 7050.719
to betray your nation is a terrifying

7047.599 --> 7053.04
thought that will be punished with

7050.719 --> 7054.599
terrifying resolve and that's how it

7053.04 --> 7057.96
should be with a

7054.599 --> 7061.159000000001
government unlike here in the west where

7057.96 --> 7064.52
people just betray to foreign

7061.159 --> 7067.598999999999
organizations and everything blatantly

7064.52 --> 7071.079000000001
and they just get away with it it's

7067.599 --> 7071.079
totally corrupted

7074.32 --> 7079.44
the worst possible

7076.56 --> 7081.84
crime a government or people within

7079.44 --> 7083.759999999999
government could commit is treason and

7081.84 --> 7085.32
they're doing it and getting away with

7083.76 --> 7089.639
it in plain

7085.32 --> 7089.639
sight that's like a pinnacle of

7090.199 --> 7095.119
corruption that's called the people

7092.36 --> 7096.0
losing complete control over government

7095.119 --> 7099.799999999999
and

7096.0 --> 7103.32
it is going to guarantee to shape itself

7099.8 --> 7106.8
into an autocratic system

7103.32 --> 7110.239
into a feudal system where the people

7106.8 --> 7114.1990000000005
are just kept out of the loop they might

7110.239 --> 7117.28
have some idea of having an influence

7114.199 --> 7117.28
but practically they

7123.639 --> 7129.04
won't all right and it needs to stop

7127.0 --> 7134.04
like I don't need

7129.04 --> 7134.04
Anarchy Anarchy is completely pointless

7134.239 --> 7138.119
you just need the government to function

7136.44 --> 7140.48
the way it's supposed to function by

7138.119 --> 7144.799999999999
having people in it that perform as they

7140.48 --> 7150.799999999999
are assigned to and follow the

7144.8 --> 7154.599
rules the rules of not betraying your

7150.8 --> 7157.04
nation it's not that

7154.599 --> 7159.28
difficult yeah it's not government

7157.04 --> 7164.04
that's the blame it's the people that

7159.28 --> 7164.04
are fulfilling these functions

7198.8 --> 7203.56
respect for their leader especially in

7224.8 --> 7228.599
it's really not that much

7228.639 --> 7235.400000000001
worse yeah they just won't call it

7232.639 --> 7237.8
that like oh you're attacking the no

7235.4 --> 7239.44
they'll just give some other reason and

7237.8 --> 7243.92
then just like make everything

7239.44 --> 7247.638999999999
impossible to you turn you into like a a

7243.92 --> 7250.2390000000005
pariah economically and socially through

7247.639 --> 7252.92
social media Etc right I mean it's it's

7250.239 --> 7254.4
all the same thing

7252.92 --> 7257.04
I mean at least in

7254.4 --> 7259.839999999999
Russia they're just being open and

7257.04 --> 7263.32
honest about it like yeah

7259.84 --> 7265.52
don't don't try to demoralize the

7263.32 --> 7270.759999999999
leadership that is obviously

7265.52 --> 7270.76
functionally doing their job really well

7285.09 --> 7288.419
[Music]

7294.159 --> 7299.159
great Free Speech policy I don't know

7296.239 --> 7302.638999999999
exactly how it works I just know they

7299.159 --> 7302.638999999999
work they actually do

7303.9 --> 7307.17
[Music]

7309.599 --> 7315.32
work yeah

7312.8 --> 7318.56
and they don't allow non-governmental

7315.32 --> 7322.36
organizations and their Marxist

7318.56 --> 7322.360000000001
trotskyite anti-human

7323.52 --> 7331.679
influences yeah they don't

7326.4 --> 7334.799999999999
do International immigration policy crap

7331.679 --> 7334.8
to destroy their

7337.36 --> 7342.679
Nation everything works way better there

7340.599 --> 7345.679
than it does over here in Europe right

7342.679 --> 7345.679
now

7375.28 --> 7381.36
yeah the point is is like I don't give a

7378.079 --> 7384.0
[ __ ] how personally allergic you are to

7381.36 --> 7386.44
however things are managed in Russia I

7384.0 --> 7391.0
think everything that they do is

7386.44 --> 7393.48
great I'm jealous in a wide variety of

7391.0 --> 7395.44
ways of Russia and how good their

7393.48 --> 7398.04
government is and how they're doing it

7395.44 --> 7400.638999999999
just the best way

7398.04 --> 7402.36
conceivable yeah it's not I might not be

7400.639 --> 7406.52
liberally I

7402.36 --> 7406.5199999999995
deal but it's the best

7406.76 --> 7414.599
way and it is proving to be the most

7410.0 --> 7417.48
functional like on the spot palpably

7414.599 --> 7421.4800000000005
measurably

7417.48 --> 7421.48
statistically yeah

7432.679 --> 7439.96
they suck yeah yeah well let me tell you

7437.04 --> 7444.4
one thing akumu virus United States

7439.96 --> 7444.4
sucks a whole lot more

7467.52 --> 7471.280000000001
[ __ ] them all okay well that's

7469.32 --> 7474.04
completely pointless then then you can

7471.28 --> 7474.04
just stay out of

7474.239 --> 7480.4
it yeah I like functional

7477.92 --> 7484.159
government I like it when people do

7480.4 --> 7484.159
their job properly

7497.239 --> 7502.678999999999
it's like this I don't like it when

7500.04 --> 7506.04
people that are not doing the

7502.679 --> 7508.8
job the way they're supposed to get a

7506.04 --> 7512.88
lot of money it's basically comes down

7508.8 --> 7514.84
to that if they do their job and it's a

7512.88 --> 7518.719
tough job and it's complicated and they

7514.84 --> 7520.719
do it like up to Specs or even better

7518.719 --> 7522.36
then I want those people to get that

7520.719 --> 7524.84
money

7522.36 --> 7527.639
they deserve it they're doing a good

7524.84 --> 7530.04
job they're a stabilizing Factor they're

7527.639 --> 7532.159000000001
reliable that's awesome I want those

7530.04 --> 7536.32
people to get rewarded I want them to

7532.159 --> 7540.28
get make more money than I do yeah what

7536.32 --> 7544.0
I don't want is people to have all fame

7540.28 --> 7546.079
or power or whatever and make a constant

7544.0 --> 7549.44
mess of everything make everything worse

7546.079 --> 7551.799999999999
for everybody else and effectively be

7549.44 --> 7553.44
parasites that are making all this money

7551.8 --> 7555.92
but making everything worse that's what

7553.44 --> 7555.919999999999
I don't

7556.639 --> 7560.679
want and that's what we're what we got

7559.159 --> 7563.679
here in the

7560.679 --> 7563.679
west

7564.559 --> 7569.84
traitors parasites that have taken hold

7567.719 --> 7572.96
of critical government

7569.84 --> 7574.92
functions and that are

7572.96 --> 7578.2390000000005
purposely

7574.92 --> 7581.0
corrupted betraying the people rolling

7578.239 --> 7583.558999999999
out policies that are detrimental to the

7581.0 --> 7583.559
nation

7590.0 --> 7597.44
like manipulating the culture and the

7592.679 --> 7597.4400000000005
people like against their own best

7599.639 --> 7605.52
interest encouraging mental illness and

7602.52 --> 7605.52
degeneracy

7615.65 --> 7619.32
[Music]

7616.88 --> 7622.719
yeah that's a

7619.32 --> 7625.558999999999
problem Russia does not do any of those

7622.719 --> 7628.8
things quite the opposite and I'm

7625.559 --> 7628.8
jealous of them for

7639.52 --> 7645.719
that absolute

7642.079 --> 7649.4
[ __ ] shut your [ __ ] mouth you

7645.719 --> 7649.4
lying propagandist

7656.32 --> 7663.0
bullshitter no Putin is

7659.84 --> 7665.599
great we're all very lucky to have Putin

7663.0 --> 7669.719
at the helm in Russia right

7665.599 --> 7672.599
now things would be a lot Messier

7669.719 --> 7674.52
yeah I mean because of this corruption

7672.599 --> 7678.639
that we're in in the west we're all kind

7674.52 --> 7678.639
of vulnerable now

7679.199 --> 7686.598999999999
and if Putin wasn't

7681.96 --> 7689.4
there he would have absolutely wrecked

7686.599 --> 7692.119000000001
yeah those alternative people that could

7689.4 --> 7694.598999999999
be ruling there that are not so

7692.119 --> 7697.32
diplomatic in

7694.599 --> 7701.96
nature yeah they could have

7697.32 --> 7706.04
absolutely devastated us the West like

7701.96 --> 7709.119
devastated us very quickly very easily

7706.04 --> 7711.8
they can still do it yeah I mean it's

7709.119 --> 7713.839999999999
basically a matter of pressing buttons

7711.8 --> 7718.400000000001
yeah and when the Russian press those

7713.84 --> 7718.400000000001
buttons [ __ ] actually does go

7723.32 --> 7728.28
down yeah unlike the rest of the

7726.04 --> 7730.4
freaking world in which like supposed

7728.28 --> 7732.759999999999
nukes and all that it's all just a

7730.4 --> 7735.44
[ __ ] Bluff yeah

7732.76 --> 7737.8
Russians have like kind of evolved

7735.44 --> 7742.119
beyond that

7737.8 --> 7742.119000000001
stupid game based system of

7750.88 --> 7757.679
nukes nukes is like a political strategy

7755.719 --> 7759.92
it's like a political

7757.679 --> 7763.119
system it's not

7759.92 --> 7766.28
real it's treated as real within the

7763.119 --> 7772.639
game on the game board of politics

7766.28 --> 7772.639
though yeah but Russians have actual

7773.92 --> 7784.559
weapons and they have very refined

7779.119 --> 7784.558999999999
strategy it's like a Next Level type of

7786.239 --> 7792.839999999999
strategy they could just [ __ ] things up

7789.159 --> 7796.079
so terribly for the West

7792.84 --> 7799.159000000001
like they can and they're not doing it

7796.079 --> 7802.119
and you can thank Putin for

7799.159 --> 7809.239
that can thank Putin for basically

7802.119 --> 7809.239
giving us a chance to sweat this disease

7813.76 --> 7819.360000000001
out and I can pretty much guarantee that

7816.8 --> 7822.1990000000005
as soon as we really start to get going

7819.36 --> 7823.598999999999
with the fever the public fever against

7822.199 --> 7827.638999999999
these

7823.599 --> 7830.8
corrupted anti-national government

7827.639 --> 7834.32
agents that Putin will

7830.8 --> 7834.320000000001
actually help us

7838.32 --> 7842.239
out but we got to do

7850.239 --> 7854.28
it for

7891.48 --> 7896.32
yeah so don't blame government Anarchy

7894.36 --> 7897.639
is not the solution to anything like

7896.32 --> 7899.599
what are you going to do with the people

7897.639 --> 7901.92
that can't rule

7899.599 --> 7905.04
themselves you're going to have to find

7901.92 --> 7908.84
some people that will manage those

7905.04 --> 7911.679
people and then have agreements upon how

7908.84 --> 7914.04
to manage those people that can't manage

7911.679 --> 7916.159
themselves and there you have a

7914.04 --> 7919.0
government yeah it's not going to work

7916.159 --> 7920.759999999999
you can't have a country without a

7919.0 --> 7923.52
government it just doesn't work there's

7920.76 --> 7925.76
going to be people that require

7923.52 --> 7928.639
governing because they can't do it

7925.76 --> 7930.679
themselves or they just

7928.639 --> 7932.28
want and they're going to ruin things

7930.679 --> 7935.76
for everybody

7932.28 --> 7938.0
else so it's not a matter of not having

7935.76 --> 7940.280000000001
government it's a matter of not having a

7938.0 --> 7941.96
corrupted government in order to not

7940.28 --> 7943.719
have a corrupted government you need to

7941.96 --> 7946.4
have people in the government that are

7943.719 --> 7947.88
not corrupted in order to have people in

7946.4 --> 7949.839999999999
government that are not corrupted you're

7947.88 --> 7952.32
going to have to kick out the corrupted

7949.84 --> 7954.719
people and replace them with people that

7952.32 --> 7954.719
aren't

7956.639 --> 7962.92
corrupted it's that

7958.96 --> 7962.92
basic how are you going to do

7964.52 --> 7969.599
it that might not be so basic

7971.239 --> 7975.239
but the base premise is pretty

7998.119 --> 8004.159
basic what are you talking about o he

8001.44 --> 8008.04
launched some kind of satellite destroy

8004.159 --> 8008.04
that what a bunch of nonsense

8043.84 --> 8046.8
yeah clutch you get

8047.32 --> 8052.0
it why does Putin not reveal the truth

8050.48 --> 8056.36
about

8052.0 --> 8059.239
space why doesn't Trump come out that

8056.36 --> 8061.5199999999995
the Earth is flat I mean it's freaking

8059.239 --> 8063.759999999999
government they have a story if you're

8061.52 --> 8067.280000000001
part of the government you're going to

8063.76 --> 8067.280000000001
have to manage that

8070.04 --> 8074.239
story and besides there's

8076.079 --> 8083.239
like why would they declassify

8080.639 --> 8085.599
that there's a lot of

8083.239 --> 8088.879999999999
development that they're

8085.599 --> 8093.1990000000005
doing actually doing unlike NASA that's

8088.88 --> 8097.679
just like just wasting giant amounts of

8093.199 --> 8097.678999999999
money and delivering very poor

8097.719 --> 8103.599
acting and like the military industrial

8101.559 --> 8105.8
complex kind of does its own thing it's

8103.599 --> 8109.32
not even tied in with it anymore I mean

8105.8 --> 8112.860000000001
then it's dysfunctional NASA is just not

8109.32 --> 8114.079
doing it doing it right in my

8112.86 --> 8116.4
[Music]

8114.079 --> 8119.04
opinion but I mean the Russian Space

8116.4 --> 8122.04
Program yeah why would they declassify

8119.04 --> 8122.04
that

8152.559 --> 8155.4400000000005
they Li

8160.88 --> 8163.88
to

8168.599 --> 8173.559
no yeah government

8177.4 --> 8184.079
governs if they have a fake story to

8181.88 --> 8186.52
uphold then they're going to just keep

8184.079 --> 8186.5199999999995
doing

8191.2 --> 8199.559
that like one thing that a government

8194.2 --> 8203.04
really is not very capable of doing is

8199.559 --> 8203.039999999999
admitting how they

8204.08 --> 8213.92
lied it requires a revolution to do that

8209.439 --> 8213.92
but yeah I mean it just doesn't

8214.359 --> 8220.04
work on average it's more effective to

8217.479 --> 8224.76
just double down on the lies and kind of

8220.04 --> 8224.76
like move the attention away from them

8268.559 --> 8273.438999999998
let's know about the second love th my

8270.88 --> 8276.438999999998
Dynamics

8273.439 --> 8278.960000000001
violation yeah I'm pretty sure that

8276.439 --> 8282.92
Putin understands that space is fake

8278.96 --> 8282.919999999998
he's too smart not to understand

8283.0 --> 8287.04
that but I think he just

8284.96 --> 8289.96
compartmentalizes it I mean I think

8287.04 --> 8294.559000000001
Putin is just very well aware is that it

8289.96 --> 8296.759999999998
is the space aspect is a futurist story

8294.559 --> 8299.679
it's there to inspire and encourage and

8296.76 --> 8304.319
he's just trying to compartmentalize it

8299.679 --> 8307.12
properly and even like keep War away

8304.319 --> 8307.119999999999
from that

8310.08 --> 8317.039999999999
story right because if you pollute the

8313.16 --> 8321.08
futurism and fantasy with war then you

8317.04 --> 8322.479000000001
ruin everybody's minds and it becomes

8321.08 --> 8324.479
like more

8322.479 --> 8328.8
aggressive so I think that he's been

8324.479 --> 8328.8
doing that very well

8331.16 --> 8337.399
right and kind of like instead

8334.559 --> 8340.0
reroute the threats and the power

8337.399 --> 8343.599
threats on

8340.0 --> 8346.559
nukes which is is

8343.599 --> 8349.28
risky cuz to a degree it doesn't

8346.559 --> 8351.759999999998
actually exist like that but I mean they

8349.28 --> 8354.2
they will have like very capable

8351.76 --> 8357.16
tactical Hypersonic missiles and such

8354.2 --> 8360.439
that are going to be extremely

8357.16 --> 8363.92
devastating right it doesn't actually

8360.439 --> 8367.439
have to be a nuclear bomb that will like

8363.92 --> 8372.0
blow everything up in order to have a

8367.439 --> 8372.0
have devastating consequences when when

8384.559 --> 8388.88
applied right

8386.88 --> 8391.839999999998
so yeah I

8388.88 --> 8394.319
mean they're going to keep upholding the

8391.84 --> 8398.359
space narrative and just do it the right

8394.319 --> 8402.359
way as a futurist inspiring

8398.359 --> 8408.439
story to try to keep people's mind on

8402.359 --> 8411.640000000001
like a growth curve for technological

8408.439 --> 8413.52
development and

8411.64 --> 8415.64
inspiration that's what they've been

8413.52 --> 8418.399000000001
using it for and that's what they have

8415.64 --> 8423.68
been using it for and done so

8418.399 --> 8423.68
successfully I'd say for

8439.49 --> 8442.66
[Music]

8465.88 --> 8470.72
really that's what you're going to be

8467.6 --> 8472.399000000001
doing complaining about getting timed

8470.72 --> 8476.679999999998
out and banned that's what you're going

8472.399 --> 8476.68
to waste your chat space on

8476.72 --> 8483.84

8691.52 --> 8694.479000000001
for this show

8697.76 --> 8705.72
[Music]

8700.439 --> 8705.720000000001
yet yeah I think I'll just make it about

8713.68 --> 8730.58
[Music]

8737.14 --> 8740.31
[Music]

8744.0 --> 8748.68
yeah that'll do just fine replace

8746.68 --> 8752.16
corrupted people in government not the

8748.68 --> 8752.16
government structure

8752.319 --> 8757.76
right and once you get the right people

8753.76 --> 8763.76
in then the Superfluous crap can be

8757.76 --> 8763.76
removed or improved refined made

8764.56 --> 8769.88
harmless you don't need to get rid of

8767.439 --> 8774.08
everything you could

8769.88 --> 8776.8
just reshape it to make it

8774.08 --> 8780.64
better and if that works well then you

8776.8 --> 8785.56
can just keep on going refining it more

8780.64 --> 8785.56
rolling back more issues making things

8786.8 --> 8792.56
simpler yeah I mean in general I think

8789.52 --> 8795.16
it would be a very good effort for any

8792.56 --> 8797.56
people that get into

8795.16 --> 8800.119999999999
government that aren't corrupted that

8797.56 --> 8804.479
have to clean up the mess to just

8800.12 --> 8806.68
like overs simpli oversimplify simplify

8804.479 --> 8806.679999999998
at

8807.24 --> 8813.56
all cuz a lot of government people es

8811.0 --> 8816.84
yeah that are on the border or fully

8813.56 --> 8820.16
corrupt that they just like try to keep

8816.84 --> 8822.12
throwing out [ __ ] in their favor for

8820.16 --> 8826.2
their agenda that's not

8822.12 --> 8826.2
necessarily good for the

8827.2 --> 8832.479000000001
nation that's what they do they just

8829.359 --> 8834.76
produce legislation more rules more

8832.479 --> 8837.519999999999
papers and then you have to kind of like

8834.76 --> 8840.800000000001
cut that out cut it out of the system

8837.52 --> 8842.84
again so that's what yeah people in

8840.8 --> 8844.319
government that aren't corrupted that

8842.84 --> 8846.52
are taking it over that's what they end

8844.319 --> 8849.199999999999
up doing just like getting trying to get

8846.52 --> 8851.92
rid of the corrupted legislation that

8849.2 --> 8854.279
was left there that was put in place you

8851.92 --> 8856.399
have to take it out of its

8854.279 --> 8859.08
place and if you're going to be doing

8856.399 --> 8861.479
that then it would be great if you just

8859.08 --> 8861.479
like

8861.52 --> 8868.279
actually adapt practical policies that

8865.359 --> 8871.960000000001
are really meant to properly govern the

8868.279 --> 8874.279
nation if you adapt more to the current

8871.96 --> 8878.0
age

8874.279 --> 8880.880000000001
because everything all development has

8878.0 --> 8883.96
gone through a lot people have gone

8880.88 --> 8886.759999999998
through a lot of development cultural

8883.96 --> 8890.358999999999
technological and just the way like

8886.76 --> 8893.800000000001
perception and Consciousness even now

8890.359 --> 8896.960000000001
functions in relation to government and

8893.8 --> 8898.479
rules is different and so it should

8896.96 --> 8901.88
be

8898.479 --> 8905.8
reassessed a new frequency should be

8901.88 --> 8909.839999999998
found for the government to

8905.8 --> 8912.039999999999
properly work out

8909.84 --> 8914.68
management and this is something that

8912.04 --> 8916.880000000001
Russia has actually done that's what

8914.68 --> 8922.84
they have done in the

8916.88 --> 8926.16
9s they created a new way of managing

8922.84 --> 8930.52
things and it turns out it works really

8926.16 --> 8930.52
well for them

8930.76 --> 8936.52
and that's what we should do too work

8933.12 --> 8938.439
out a new way of doing things that works

8936.52 --> 8941.479000000001
well for

8938.439 --> 8944.880000000001
us based on

8941.479 --> 8946.679999999998
the on where people are at and where

8944.88 --> 8949.64
they could

8946.68 --> 8954.64
go you have to have a vision as to like

8949.64 --> 8954.64
where are the people going to develop

8954.72 --> 8959.24
to they had that Vision with the

8957.439 --> 8963.720000000001
Russians and that's why their government

8959.24 --> 8967.039999999999
currently ising working so dare I say

8963.72 --> 8967.039999999999
fantastically so

8968.319 --> 8974.24
well considering the all of the

8971.24 --> 8974.24
circumstances

8984.12 --> 8987.429
[Music]

9005.399 --> 9010.72
happiness score yeah whatever man

9008.56 --> 9013.6
[ __ ] happiness score I don't give a

9010.72 --> 9018.0
[ __ ] about happiness score

9013.6 --> 9022.359
yeah I'm more about getting real

9018.0 --> 9025.359
score besides Russ people are

9022.359 --> 9025.359
traditionally

9025.92 --> 9032.12
stoic and have longstanding issues that

9030.12 --> 9036.08
are just like genetic or

9032.12 --> 9040.08
something with skepticism and depression

9036.08 --> 9042.72
like that's it's not really fair to

9040.08 --> 9044.359
compare yeah and oh Netherlands has a

9042.72 --> 9047.358999999999
higher happiness score what because

9044.359 --> 9051.68
we're more effectively indoctrinated

9047.359 --> 9051.68
with anti-human nonsense

9054.92 --> 9059.56
because people are converted to

9056.92 --> 9062.52
basically lie to themselves

9059.56 --> 9064.92
more to be able to convince everybody

9062.52 --> 9064.92
that they're

9070.76 --> 9076.399
happy yeah I mean when you

9073.68 --> 9078.84
flip everything inside out inside of

9076.399 --> 9080.8
your mind and heart then yeah you're

9078.84 --> 9082.8
going to be very happy with the world

9080.8 --> 9084.399
the way it works because it's all

9082.8 --> 9087.16
everything is

9084.399 --> 9091.16
wrong and terrible things are happening

9087.16 --> 9091.16
that you think are good

9119.92 --> 9123.84
they usually walk on eggshells with

9122.08 --> 9127.08
their government yeah

9123.84 --> 9130.319
because that government actually

9127.08 --> 9131.96
deserves some respect kumu virus yeah

9130.319 --> 9135.359
that's the

9131.96 --> 9135.358999999999
different that's the

9137.08 --> 9140.479
difference yeah their government

9139.439 --> 9142.76
actually

9140.479 --> 9145.479
demands some

9142.76 --> 9148.08
respect they don't allow you to be just

9145.479 --> 9148.08
complete

9158.279 --> 9163.880000000001
Apes right but in return they don't act

9161.64 --> 9167.199999999999
like complete Apes either so they

9163.88 --> 9170.64
actually deserve that kind of

9167.2 --> 9173.479000000001
respect government that isn't corrupted

9170.64 --> 9176.88
deserves some kind of respect and they

9173.479 --> 9176.88
have the right to demand

9187.88 --> 9195.88
it yeah clutch yeah it's it's all

9191.6 --> 9200.24
nonsense like they are rolling out it

9195.88 --> 9202.119999999999
the amount of anti-russian propaganda

9200.24 --> 9204.92
that has rolled out in the last two

9202.12 --> 9209.279
decades is like the just the sheer

9204.92 --> 9212.12
preponderance of it has just convoluted

9209.279 --> 9215.12
everybody's view like if you want to see

9212.12 --> 9217.560000000001
Russia as the Badman then there's like

9215.12 --> 9219.68
endless amounts of misinformation that's

9217.56 --> 9222.479
just rolled around like it's common

9219.68 --> 9225.52
thing like it's common

9222.479 --> 9227.479
Truth for you to latch on to and

9225.52 --> 9229.2
reference and that's what a lot of

9227.479 --> 9234.119999999999
people in the chat right now are doing

9229.2 --> 9234.12
it's all [ __ ] Russia is doing

9236.08 --> 9241.16
great but I'm sure you'll be able to

9238.399 --> 9243.519999999999
find like endless amounts of

9241.16 --> 9245.92
justifications and statistics and

9243.52 --> 9249.04
studies that prove that it's all just

9245.92 --> 9251.439
wrong it's all just make belief and

9249.04 --> 9252.800000000001
we're doing way better here in Europe

9251.439 --> 9256.08
than

9252.8 --> 9261.24
Russia you're going to believe that

9256.08 --> 9261.24
really you actually believe that

9271.12 --> 9276.68

9342.76 --> 9347.68
