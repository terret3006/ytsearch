be much appreciated so today the weather

74.49 --> 85.35
is just glorious and yeah I tried to do

80.7 --> 87.0
a p900 shot earlier because there's

85.35 --> 88.86
still some planes going around yeah you

87.0 --> 94.35
can't really see it properly with that

88.86 --> 96.6
webcam but yeah I tried it I thought I

94.35 --> 100.38
had a great shot and then the battery

96.6 --> 106.02
died and as the battery died so did the

100.38 --> 107.94
movie it got broken so unfortunately I'm

106.02 --> 110.97
yeah and then the yeah now I'm

107.94 --> 113.28
recharging the battery but yeah it it

110.97 --> 115.229
doesn't last longer than like two

113.28 --> 118.83
minutes now it's terrible when I'm

115.229 --> 121.14
filming though seems to be draining very

118.83 --> 127.88
quick when I'm filming in over there is

121.14 --> 127.88
George enjoying the weather

127.979 --> 135.68
but look it's just not a speck

141.62 --> 151.25
yeah beautiful beautiful Sunday morning

146.87 --> 157.51
or afternoon here I hope it's the same

151.25 --> 160.94
oh where you are so yep today I got

157.51 --> 163.629
Tamera coffee with me and tea and that's

160.94 --> 167.09
it enough goodies for now

163.629 --> 169.25
yesterday I barely even ate from that

167.09 --> 174.59
but eventually I did finish it all

169.25 --> 179.269
ending with the Apple night but yeah I

174.59 --> 185.18
did stay up relatively late so I had a

179.269 --> 189.31900000000002
very long day overall and no way to say

185.18 --> 191.87
I had like a drive again like I don't

189.319 --> 200.08999999999997
want to end the day and so it's a stupid

191.87 --> 203.20000000000002
when you get caught up in that but I did

200.09 --> 203.20000000000002
have a lot of fun yesterday

205.329 --> 208.88
yeah cut own Benjamin on another

208.069 --> 218.06
livestream

208.88 --> 221.389
I was interesting nickels wet a got a

218.06 --> 224.81
big whopping this time and it was

221.389 --> 228.29000000000002
hilarious and I me too unleashed

224.81 --> 230.859
I am leashed on the memes as well so

228.29 --> 230.85899999999998
that was fun

236.299 --> 240.12
even though you have to be fair I'm just

238.59 --> 243.719
going along with it because I haven't

240.12 --> 245.64000000000001
really watched any materials of him well

243.719 --> 254.819
except for what others have shown me

245.64 --> 258.65999999999997
including on Benjamin himself and the

254.819 --> 261.419
whole character character and what he

258.66 --> 265.949
does it to me it kind of does seem out

261.419 --> 270.04999999999995
of whack in a way but yeah so many have

265.949 --> 270.05
their own little twists to what they do

272.96 --> 277.46999999999997
anyway I'm not I'm gonna stay out of it

275.58 --> 280.039
most most of time but the memes are

277.47 --> 280.03900000000004
hilarious

283.42 --> 290.81
[Music]

285.61 --> 292.69
anyway hey Nathan Oakley to see you yeah

290.81 --> 296.84
let's go through a chat for a moment

292.69 --> 302.46999999999997
okay a GM was first today a man the

296.84 --> 309.88
young the studio's 68 or any Astellas

302.47 --> 309.88000000000005
Tao Asteria kamikaze Gilmore

313.79 --> 321.38
good servant Nathan Oakley Roger MC

317.33 --> 324.34999999999997
Hawaiian aquatic courts George Sanford

321.38 --> 333.95
101 rock hound yeah good morning good

324.35 --> 336.49
see you all look at that George is

333.95 --> 336.49
posing

346.51 --> 349.65999999999997
[Music]

351.42 --> 360.3
now it's just enjoying yourself yg does

355.89 --> 365.63
look kind of cool like that mm-hmm

360.3 --> 365.63
Hey and a Meakin to see you

370.86 --> 377.159
so watch back yesterday's episode and

374.169 --> 377.159
was all over the place

386.33 --> 396.02
but yeah I was all true and still pretty

390.68 --> 398.69
much going on from that point looking

396.02 --> 402.85999999999996
leaving figuring out what everybody's

398.69 --> 407.0
doing there's a lot of kids fooling

402.86 --> 414.379
around with fireworks outside it's

407.0 --> 416.629
usually in the Netherlands when New

414.379 --> 418.78900000000004
Year's Eve approach is like way before

416.629 --> 422.06
that people just go ballistic on the

418.789 --> 426.11
fireworks so we got that a lot like as

422.06 --> 428.18
soon as it gets cold I used to be a

426.11 --> 432.289
total pyromaniac with fireworks when I

428.18 --> 434.169
was a little kid but ya don't really do

432.289 --> 438.49
it anymore

434.169 --> 438.49
it's way too expensive anyway

455.78 --> 460.17999999999995
ah too bad to hear that AGM

490.65 --> 493.95
[Music]

496.42 --> 499.54900000000004
[Music]

510.469 --> 513.469
okay

513.7 --> 521.5390000000001
weird

515.919 --> 530.0889999999999
somebody called Dean ray added me and

521.539 --> 536.019
then and and he wasn't my early bird

530.089 --> 536.019
chat was that that's weird

543.03 --> 546.03
anyway

553.4 --> 556.4
see

557.46 --> 565.69
yeah I'm gonna get a AP 900 battery a

562.42 --> 568.75
new one and a battery charger after the

565.69 --> 570.46
show ends pretty quickly because yeah

568.75 --> 573.21
there's a store open that still sells

570.46 --> 575.4100000000001
them I think or even at least p900

573.21 --> 580.1800000000001
related things I'm at least gonna go

575.41 --> 582.91
there and try and yeah if it's not gonna

580.18 --> 584.77
work out I'll just order it but it

582.91 --> 586.9
should be too expensive from what I've

584.77 --> 591.25
searched for so far

586.9 --> 593.77
and that'll help me a lot because this

591.25 --> 598.15
constant dyeing of the battery isn't

593.77 --> 601.1999999999999
really helping helping me get good

598.15 --> 601.1999999999999
footage with my p900

604.71 --> 618.1500000000001
anyway so yeah let's see if we can dig

611.65 --> 620.14
into some flat earth related subjects

618.15 --> 627.0699999999999
eventually yesterday had some good

620.14 --> 630.04
questions I wouldn't mind going into all

627.07 --> 634.589
that again I was very good to put down

630.04 --> 634.5889999999999
relative density again

638.27 --> 646.59
and it's also fun to just be able to

641.04 --> 648.87
make claims about it that you can back

646.59 --> 651.0500000000001
up that's really the funnest part about

648.87 --> 651.05
it

666.42 --> 679.3199999999999
oh you again the heathen haven't had

670.59 --> 683.15
enough gonna get anymore mr. twenty-year

679.32 --> 683.1500000000001
26 years of pseudoscience

687.759 --> 695.6990000000001
what space macaroni picture are you are

691.839 --> 695.6990000000001
working on these days they even

705.64 --> 709.75
hello retinue staff and hey listen

715.63 --> 719.389
[Music]

725.16 --> 732.66
hmm yeah they like oh hi that seems very

729.56 --> 734.9399999999999
interesting option so I'm gonna look

732.66 --> 738.3
into that as well yeah so you could

734.94 --> 742.3100000000001
literally just wire it in no issues with

738.3 --> 742.31
batteries that would be great

747.05 --> 754.9699999999999
Oh God that's totally forgot about the

752.27 --> 756.9499999999999
wakey-wakey video there's been the

754.97 --> 764.39
hassle about it I still haven't watched

756.95 --> 768.13
it I completely forgot about it it seems

764.39 --> 768.13
that it was a bit messy here and there

769.43 --> 772.5899999999999
[Music]

775.91 --> 778.6899999999999
hmm

783.88 --> 786.95
[Music]

797.17 --> 800.459
a little nutty

806.6 --> 811.2900000000001
[Music]

808.33 --> 814.09
Ragnar Steffen eldest and watch Hills

811.29 --> 816.78
did you see the Scheels yesterday what

814.09 --> 816.7800000000001
are you talking about

850.68 --> 867.4
da-rae wait isn't I think that Dean is

861.18 --> 869.53
probably a baller guy and I think I

867.4 --> 871.74
added him to my ear now I remember who

869.53 --> 871.74
he is

899.439 --> 905.0989999999999
right Jorge Sanford indeed

902.069 --> 909.8789999999999
astrophysicists are or they're confined

905.099 --> 912.9100000000001
by rules they're caged by by a framework

909.879 --> 916.089
and that is where they are allowed to do

912.91 --> 920.249
things within and if it surpasses the

916.089 --> 926.729
framework then it's just ignored or

920.249 --> 933.8190000000001
discarded or you become ejected but yeah

926.729 --> 936.279
they can't really do anything that moves

933.819 --> 941.049
beyond the basic framework set up of

936.279 --> 943.419
where they're what they're doing so they

941.049 --> 946.829
can do yes presuppositional speculations

943.419 --> 950.0989999999999
and then that's it

946.829 --> 950.0989999999999
paint the picture

955.739 --> 964.089
it's kind of funny because when I was

958.389 --> 968.79
was it like seven and eight I think one

964.089 --> 971.2900000000001
time me and my family we had like a a

968.79 --> 974.799
drawing face everybody was painting or

971.29 --> 976.899
drawing everybody had at some point and

974.799 --> 979.989
I was very much into drawing when I was

976.899 --> 983.47
like a very young kid and then we

979.989 --> 987.1
painted a we took a giant roll of paper

983.47 --> 990.489
and rolled it and was like several

987.1 --> 993.549
meters long like 20 meters and we kept

990.489 --> 997.509
on drawing on it and it was like yeah I

993.549 --> 1000.119
drew or we all drew but I was basically

997.509 --> 1001.23
eventually the one that was like getting

1000.119 --> 1005.6990000000001
obsessed about it

1001.23 --> 1008.509
a giant space universe all over it and

1005.699 --> 1014.2199999999999
with stuff in it and Suns and planets

1008.509 --> 1018.419
and spaceships and anything all of it

1014.22 --> 1024.8700000000001
and in a way that is kind of what

1018.419 --> 1029.37
astrophysicists are doing as well and it

1024.87 --> 1031.289
is kind of fun to do it just has its

1029.37 --> 1035.299
limits it's like McIlroy that's why I

1031.289 --> 1035.299
call it space macaroni pictures

1035.73 --> 1038.88
[Music]

1044.739 --> 1053.72
all right yeah yeah Ragnar Stefan

1050.72 --> 1058.269
Halverson JME truth TV right yeah I've

1053.72 --> 1061.309
had him on on my show he's a bit of

1058.269 --> 1068.83
peculiar but very interesting individual

1061.309 --> 1068.83
and he is spirited

1072.0 --> 1078.99
and I don't know from what I've seen I

1075.25 --> 1078.99
thought he was just a very good guy

1083.02 --> 1088.27
but in a way yeah he did seem kind of

1085.3 --> 1094.09
odd to me but yeah Who am I to call

1088.27 --> 1100.24
somebody else odd you know yeah but yeah

1094.09 --> 1103.57
but he has like pretty like hardcore

1100.24 --> 1106.48
stances through his personal perspective

1103.57 --> 1108.85
on things like like really he's very

1106.48 --> 1112.74
fanatically vegan for example and even

1108.85 --> 1117.34
tries to tie it into the whole issue

1112.74 --> 1119.64
with who according to the like you're

1117.34 --> 1123.97
not supposed to kill not even animals

1119.64 --> 1126.0400000000002
etc so he goes on that that train of

1123.97 --> 1128.559
thought and that is basically what he

1126.04 --> 1130.87
uses as his personal conviction now if

1128.559 --> 1132.79
he's gonna attack other people's by that

1130.87 --> 1135.4899999999998
standard he has a problem I don't think

1132.79 --> 1138.52
he really does that he's very wise and

1135.49 --> 1142.36
modest at it doesn't really attack other

1138.52 --> 1144.85
people from what I've seen but yeah as

1142.36 --> 1148.4499999999998
I've heard reflected upon by other

1144.85 --> 1152.6789999999999
Christians like for example Paula but

1148.45 --> 1154.6000000000001
not only her like that's not technically

1152.679 --> 1157.9
how it works it's like using the old

1154.6 --> 1163.1499999999999
rules and bypassing the the core

1157.9 --> 1166.5
foundation in the end etc etc but yeah

1163.15 --> 1172.15
that is what he does I do it literally

1166.5 --> 1173.95
empirically myself I just listened to my

1172.15 --> 1176.2900000000002
metabolism I try to figure it out and

1173.95 --> 1182.8300000000002
reflect upon what happens with people

1176.29 --> 1189.94
other people and then I judge by that

1182.83 --> 1193.33
and just take it as a like yeah creation

1189.94 --> 1196.78
spelling it out for you that's logos

1193.33 --> 1201.76
revealing like this this is bad that is

1196.78 --> 1204.54
good through through the design through

1201.76 --> 1204.54
nature itself

1210.64 --> 1225.409
hmm hey yellow sky's the limit bear

1214.22 --> 1228.97
ready or not for you for - when was he

1225.409 --> 1235.7890000000002
on well just look in my early bird video

1228.97 --> 1238.309
list and you'll see his name you know

1235.789 --> 1239.0
when I get a guest on especially for the

1238.309 --> 1241.7
first time

1239.0 --> 1244.789
I literally just call the episode the

1241.7 --> 1247.69
name of the person like with so it

1244.789 --> 1252.14
should be easy to find

1247.69 --> 1256.8500000000001
well yeah easy to find it's like 360

1252.14 --> 1260.39
episode of what but I don't know it was

1256.85 --> 1264.77
it wasn't I think it was maybe somewhere

1260.39 --> 1267.23
in the hundreds under 20 or something I

1264.77 --> 1271.21
I don't remember exact could be before

1267.23 --> 1271.21
hundreds it's been a while

1282.26 --> 1284.95
it's

1295.419 --> 1304.1090000000002
right kamikaze Gilmore dead yeah that's

1301.149 --> 1308.1999999999998
that's a good way to describe it

1304.109 --> 1312.389
it's a coloring book indeed I I prefer

1308.2 --> 1312.3890000000001
to call it just the macaroni picture

1322.789 --> 1330.849
since yeah so much is dependent on the

1325.969 --> 1330.8490000000002
imagination for it to work you know

1331.239 --> 1336.829
that's the funny thing about macaroni

1333.349 --> 1338.9589999999998
pictures it's just you have to do

1336.829 --> 1341.57
something with it and then you just try

1338.959 --> 1346.6390000000001
to conjure something with the macaroni

1341.57 --> 1349.339
in the picture to suggest something in

1346.639 --> 1356.6589999999999
some way it just figure it out whatever

1349.339 --> 1358.789
works and that's much of what the globe

1356.659 --> 1363.229
model and the outer universe what that

1358.789 --> 1368.479
is just trying to make it look like yeah

1363.229 --> 1370.749
it's good work I guess if the math says

1368.479 --> 1370.749
it

1372.41 --> 1375.6090000000002
[Music]

1380.93 --> 1385.9
maybe it's more like a math Corona

1383.33 --> 1385.8999999999999
picture

1390.49 --> 1393.67
[Music]

1393.85 --> 1407.53
here I'll spell it out for you extra

1404.12 --> 1407.53
cheesy indeed

1440.71 --> 1459.059
what are you talking about football

1445.44 --> 1459.059
cease or I shall time you out WikiWiki

1460.019 --> 1477.749
ah you'd stop it

1485.29 --> 1489.79
all right yeah if you're not gonna stop

1487.54 --> 1494.26
it I'll just bring up some other British

1489.79 --> 1496.99
thing okay because I got another update

1494.26 --> 1499.12
today before the show what an hour

1496.99 --> 1503.55
before the show a live stream which

1499.12 --> 1507.3999999999999
pretty sizable from LBC and it was

1503.55 --> 1511.8999999999999
interesting and hilarious in the chat as

1507.4 --> 1515.6200000000001
well because there was somebody from the

1511.9 --> 1519.97
Green Party basically putting down the

1515.62 --> 1521.6499999999999
platform and it was interesting in the

1519.97 --> 1528.69
sense that there were some very

1521.65 --> 1531.3400000000001
worrisome things in that for example the

1528.69 --> 1534.5800000000002
climate changed nonsense they really

1531.34 --> 1538.84
were for that but then again eventually

1534.58 --> 1541.6899999999998
stepped off that got slapped like oh

1538.84 --> 1543.31
there's grass everywhere and I even

1541.69 --> 1545.68
coming in and chat like oh my god

1543.31 --> 1547.6599999999999
they're gonna make all the Green Party

1545.68 --> 1550.93
leaders look like Greta they're all

1547.66 --> 1555.52
gonna literally like turn into Greta

1550.93 --> 1558.73
mushrooms but on the other hand yeah

1555.52 --> 1561.37
there was also talk about like boo dog

1558.73 --> 1566.74
know what the stance on drugs were and

1561.37 --> 1569.5
they said no you fight criminality by

1566.74 --> 1572.83
legalizing even if it that means hard

1569.5 --> 1575.59
drugs it's like Oh rubber rubber rubber

1572.83 --> 1577.3899999999999
rubber rebel of course that's logical is

1575.59 --> 1579.1299999999999
it cuz nobody wants their kids to get

1577.39 --> 1585.5800000000002
access to hard rock the blah blah blah

1579.13 --> 1589.1200000000001
but technically there is something to

1585.58 --> 1591.9099999999999
that because if you legalize it then

1589.12 --> 1594.6999999999998
certainly criminals will kind of lose

1591.91 --> 1598.96
grip they're going to have to like get

1594.7 --> 1602.64
in line get out of dark and there's

1598.96 --> 1606.6100000000001
there could be competition and

1602.64 --> 1610.1200000000001
regulation and all that and yeah so it's

1606.61 --> 1612.1
like hey to me like okay that stupid

1610.12 --> 1615.5
climate change nonsense it's just

1612.1 --> 1618.74
terrible but if they'd only drop that

1615.5 --> 1623.96
then it might actually be somewhat

1618.74 --> 1625.52
interesting it's like yeah but yeah then

1623.96 --> 1627.5
of course they're never gonna drop the

1625.52 --> 1629.75
climate change nonsense because it is

1627.5 --> 1632.799
the very core of the whole thing they're

1629.75 --> 1640.24
trying to write it is the corporate

1632.799 --> 1642.32
endeavor that feeds their entire thing

1640.24 --> 1645.799
they're invested in that I think

1642.32 --> 1647.8999999999999
probably in the whole climate credit

1645.799 --> 1650.44
system and all that so it's like yeah

1647.9 --> 1652.789
there they couldn't step away from that

1650.44 --> 1654.919
and that makes the whole thing kind of

1652.789 --> 1657.95
futile everything everything else all

1654.919 --> 1660.26
the other things are just side nonsense

1657.95 --> 1664.07
why would you worry about ooh this or

1660.26 --> 1666.47
that when literally the life is gonna be

1664.07 --> 1668.48
drained out of everything suddenly all

1666.47 --> 1672.98
the works not gonna yield [ __ ] anymore

1668.48 --> 1679.39
we're all gonna be clamped down so yeah

1672.98 --> 1685.22
I am getting really sick of how strongly

1679.39 --> 1688.1200000000001
the climate change [ __ ] has kept

1685.22 --> 1691.789
continue waiting in politics how badly

1688.12 --> 1694.6999999999998
they're pushing it through even through

1691.789 --> 1697.37
the schools I'm really worried about

1694.7 --> 1702.26
that and not about the climate changing

1697.37 --> 1706.6399999999999
but about these people trying to put a

1702.26 --> 1711.11
cage around us trying to make us stand

1706.64 --> 1717.0800000000002
still while they put the the chains on

1711.11 --> 1718.9699999999998
us and it's it's idiotic it's idiotic

1717.08 --> 1723.4089999999999
that we're considering this and that

1718.97 --> 1725.57
we're not stepping letting the bill go

1723.409 --> 1728.419
to the side and just see what the entire

1725.57 --> 1731.1789999999999
setup of this is that we're being

1728.419 --> 1737.9
subjected by a hostile force with this

1731.179 --> 1742.13
with this political setup and like go

1737.9 --> 1744.23
along to get along is yeah how far do

1742.13 --> 1746.3300000000002
you go along to get along do you go

1744.23 --> 1748.63
along to get along literally into

1746.33 --> 1752.9499999999998
slavery does the

1748.63 --> 1759.91
make any sense or is that practically

1752.95 --> 1763.39
suicidal to go for that I think it is I

1759.91 --> 1766.9
think it is mental insanity that this

1763.39 --> 1770.41
climate change nonsense has has been

1766.9 --> 1773.1100000000001
allowed to progress as badly as it has

1770.41 --> 1776.53
it's ridiculous now there's always going

1773.11 --> 1781.9299999999998
to be issues with pollution and poison

1776.53 --> 1783.8799999999999
and how do you go about waste and

1781.93 --> 1786.8100000000002
recycle it that there of course there's

1783.88 --> 1791.88
issues concerning the climate concerning

1786.81 --> 1796.57
viability of our resources all that but

1791.88 --> 1799.5300000000002
this is not that it's exactly the

1796.57 --> 1803.83
opposite it's completely completely

1799.53 --> 1807.94
bypassing the real care responsibility

1803.83 --> 1810.06
that we have as the yeah the sentient

1807.94 --> 1813.3400000000001
beings on this lot on this world

1810.06 --> 1817.6299999999999
bypassing that and actually abusing that

1813.34 --> 1821.74
very care in human beings to enslave

1817.63 --> 1823.48
them in a senseless way to fight off a

1821.74 --> 1825.49
ghost something that should not be

1823.48 --> 1828.1200000000001
fought off because it is true not true

1825.49 --> 1830.89
what it said about it

1828.12 --> 1833.1999999999998
co2 is not a problem

1830.89 --> 1835.3500000000001
not even method it's all within the

1833.2 --> 1839.71
container anyway it's gonna get recycled

1835.35 --> 1843.79
for every breath taking animal and human

1839.71 --> 1849.19
being that does stuff even if they do

1843.79 --> 1852.9099999999999
get bit messy a plant somewhere gladly

1849.19 --> 1857.44
pops up and breathes in all that co2 to

1852.91 --> 1860.89
breathe out oxygen so it is completely

1857.44 --> 1863.17
senseless entirely to worry about it

1860.89 --> 1866.41
about that issue it is the most

1863.17 --> 1869.8000000000002
senseless idiotic thing I've ever heard

1866.41 --> 1873.01
and it is beyond embarrassing that

1869.8 --> 1875.71
humanity can be enthralled by this in

1873.01 --> 1878.95
any way although you have with really

1875.71 --> 1880.56
young people they're literally just

1878.95 --> 1883.3300000000002
being

1880.56 --> 1885.55
mentally subjected to lunacy and

1883.33 --> 1888.6699999999998
everybody is allowing I can't believe

1885.55 --> 1892.09
that parents are just letting their

1888.67 --> 1894.22
children do this and I don't know

1892.09 --> 1900.37
gloating along thinking they're doing

1894.22 --> 1903.21
the right it is it is insufferable it is

1900.37 --> 1903.2099999999998
sin

1906.36 --> 1909.4499999999998
[Music]

1923.02 --> 1929.16
Oh God stop talking about football

1933.09 --> 1937.9599999999998
that's nonsense regular Stefan audition

1935.95 --> 1942.7
you are you're clearly not listening

1937.96 --> 1946.8700000000001
again for all the co2 we put out and

1942.7 --> 1952.45
even industrial so a plant pops up

1946.87 --> 1957.1299999999999
somewhere like exhilarated like oh I get

1952.45 --> 1960.13
a cut so I can live and grow and we

1957.13 --> 1963.3700000000001
don't have to do that it happens it's

1960.13 --> 1966.99
there though the potential is there

1963.37 --> 1966.9899999999998
it'll just do it

1971.13 --> 1977.929
like you really have to like do your

1975.12 --> 1980.85
best to create an unbalance like that

1977.929 --> 1982.95
like for example just scorching

1980.85 --> 1985.9399999999998
everything all at once yeah that's gonna

1982.95 --> 1991.5900000000001
ruin [ __ ] you know that's gonna such an

1985.94 --> 1994.41
imbalance such asymmetry that yeah then

1991.59 --> 1995.3999999999999
maybe life--all whatever but that's not

1994.41 --> 2000.309
happening

1995.4 --> 2003.5300000000002
never happens even regions could

2000.309 --> 2005.539
potentially burn for a while it has

2003.53 --> 2007.039
always happened that kind of thing has

2005.539 --> 2010.96
happened in the past

2007.039 --> 2015.62
that's normal it doesn't destroy the

2010.96 --> 2018.65
entire climate when that happens just

2015.62 --> 2021.8899999999999
don't go light fires everywhere unless

2018.65 --> 2023.5700000000002
you're doing it as fire control and now

2021.89 --> 2026.48
for example in the United States

2023.57 --> 2029.299
especially in the central documentaries

2026.48 --> 2031.97
about I've been interested in it they

2029.299 --> 2035.69
traditionally do controlled burns or

2031.97 --> 2040.8700000000001
burn off so there's just wide landscapes

2035.69 --> 2043.49
with forests or yeah bit in between for

2040.87 --> 2046.01
light force with just a lot of hills and

2043.49 --> 2048.679
everything and then old wood gathers and

2046.01 --> 2052.369
then just squared off say okay this part

2048.679 --> 2054.44
burns and that actually helps nature a

2052.369 --> 2058.94
bit yeah does a little damage but it

2054.44 --> 2062.7200000000003
then prevents any accidental fire from

2058.94 --> 2065.119
spreading through that region and yeah

2062.72 --> 2067.85
it doesn't destroy everything it

2065.119 --> 2068.659
actually helps because if people

2067.85 --> 2072.889
wouldn't do that

2068.659 --> 2074.69
then there would be accidental burns out

2072.889 --> 2082.76
of control potentially doing much more

2074.69 --> 2086.69
damage so it is normal don't worry it's

2082.76 --> 2089.48
self-contained creation is a magnificent

2086.69 --> 2095.08
thing it is it is brilliant

2089.48 --> 2097.67
it works stop worrying so much about

2095.08 --> 2099.44
potentially doing something that we

2097.67 --> 2102.42
probably could never do in the first

2099.44 --> 2104.96
place even if we really try for some in

2102.42 --> 2104.96
reason

2117.749 --> 2126.5389999999998
yeah I told you guys it's really

2123.849 --> 2129.96
annoying stop it

2126.539 --> 2129.96
you too Adam

2148.589 --> 2155.64
now I don't care about football Adam I

2151.769 --> 2160.109
really don't maybe some international

2155.64 --> 2162.41
thing but no I don't care

2160.109 --> 2162.41
sorry

2171.41 --> 2176.3599999999997
it's like the only good reason for me to

2173.69 --> 2178.46
watch football is watching it with my

2176.36 --> 2179.96
dad and the reason would be my dad

2178.46 --> 2185.14
thinks it's a lot of fun

2179.96 --> 2185.14
and I enjoy that and then it becomes fun

2189.61 --> 2194.83
yeah exactly their sport channels out

2192.44 --> 2194.83
there guys

2221.35 --> 2227.179
[Music]

2223.569 --> 2236.229
really Ragnar Stefan hey listen prove it

2227.179 --> 2236.2290000000003
prove it come on

2278.01 --> 2283.7700000000004
oh so you just want to have this panic

2281.76 --> 2289.8500000000004
inside of you regular stuff in Harrison

2283.77 --> 2293.73
and and not actually provide a a

2289.85 --> 2300.1189999999997
foundation for those assumptions that

2293.73 --> 2302.79
seems kind of senselessly bleak to claim

2300.119 --> 2305.67
that outlook yeah the number what

2302.79 --> 2307.23
numbers again this is all superficial

2305.67 --> 2310.46
[ __ ] you're putting out why don't

2307.23 --> 2310.46
you actually prove it

2318.01 --> 2320.7900000000004
come on

2334.14 --> 2342.0899999999997
it's much tougher than you think isn't

2336.09 --> 2351.3900000000003
it because it is a hype word it's all

2342.09 --> 2355.1000000000004
doomed I can post LinkedIn yeah I know

2351.39 --> 2355.1
it was hilariously liar

2358.0 --> 2361.46
[Music]

2369.17 --> 2383.79
all right how dare are you so silly just

2379.04 --> 2389.12
show us your graph shows the proof show

2383.79 --> 2391.85
us what for you is material data

2389.12 --> 2395.97
conclusion worthy of oh it's all gonna

2391.85 --> 2401.73
die it's doomed and then let's compare

2395.97 --> 2404.2799999999997
the the situation and the data to other

2401.73 --> 2406.7400000000002
scenarios in history because there's a

2404.28 --> 2410.27
lot of things that happened in histories

2406.74 --> 2412.83
and even the Industrial Revolution look

2410.27 --> 2414.05
this is something that people don't get

2412.83 --> 2418.92
okay

2414.05 --> 2422.04
the Industrial Revolution now that is

2418.92 --> 2425.85
something that had some real big

2422.04 --> 2429.09
impactful damage that they did because

2425.85 --> 2431.91
of just the potential and they just they

2429.09 --> 2436.58
just couldn't help it but yeah when you

2431.91 --> 2440.49
suddenly can transform just regular life

2436.58 --> 2442.83
plants trees forests into industrial

2440.49 --> 2446.79
material and every suddenly everybody

2442.83 --> 2449.52
starts just chopping it down and

2446.79 --> 2452.52
building [ __ ] and yeah then suddenly

2449.52 --> 2455.16
radical quick change but that is because

2452.52 --> 2460.08
of the contrast but at the same time

2455.16 --> 2462.75
things did change but also did get

2460.08 --> 2465.5699999999997
through that there was probably even

2462.75 --> 2466.85
back in the time just big weather

2465.57 --> 2470.75
response

2466.85 --> 2474.5
to having done that in the speed that

2470.75 --> 2480.56
they did now what we're doing right now

2474.5 --> 2483.85
is not the same I think not to that

2480.56 --> 2483.85
level not even close

2485.23 --> 2491.03
and don't need to do that anymore that's

2488.69 --> 2495.41
the whole thing efficiency of Industry

2491.03 --> 2497.8700000000003
and just being more careful for logical

2495.41 --> 2501.68
reasons just being less reckless so you

2497.87 --> 2504.35
still have some viable ground for the

2501.68 --> 2508.6099999999997
future left to do new things with that

2504.35 --> 2513.44
kind of approach in just more people and

2508.61 --> 2516.29
that helped us a lot it's not out of

2513.44 --> 2518.68
whack yeah there's more co2 being used

2516.29 --> 2524.2
probably even other gas is just being

2518.68 --> 2527.69
thrown out there and it does have effect

2524.2 --> 2530.35
but there is no direct Cataclysm and

2527.69 --> 2534.64
even preliminary dangers that are

2530.35 --> 2538.4
actually real and just empirically

2534.64 --> 2540.97
provable very directly yeah

2538.4 --> 2546.6800000000003
those can be learned from and then

2540.97 --> 2551.33
bypassed prevented and that's what has

2546.68 --> 2556.7
happened for a great deal there's a lot

2551.33 --> 2561.49
of environmental things the West has

2556.7 --> 2565.0699999999997
figured out in the last 50 years a lot

2561.49 --> 2567.1699999999996
and we should not underestimate how that

2565.07 --> 2569.8700000000003
changed how everything worked and that

2567.17 --> 2572.4500000000003
preliminary ideas about

2569.87 --> 2575.54
industrialization and the responses back

2572.45 --> 2578.18
then to it the environment that we're in

2575.54 --> 2580.48
the same package we're not it's not the

2578.18 --> 2580.48
same

2588.41 --> 2591.469
[Music]

2599.32 --> 2610.3900000000003
it's no eye level awaken it or Antoni

2605.28 --> 2615.76
like that Antonio no I never don't watch

2610.39 --> 2618.46
his channel at all so but yeah not

2615.76 --> 2621.6400000000003
surprised that he would grab it it was

2618.46 --> 2623.56
so wide to everybody put that that out I

2621.64 --> 2625.3599999999997
played it on my early bird show

2623.56 --> 2627.5499999999997
everybody uploaded it and made a video

2625.36 --> 2633.9700000000003
about it yes no no surprise that he

2627.55 --> 2636.19
treated it as well but yeah Warren Evans

2633.97 --> 2640.3799999999997
no I don't think I'll be watching

2636.19 --> 2640.38
mercury crossing the Sun tomorrow I

2641.16 --> 2648.96
don't think I my camera could pick that

2644.32 --> 2653.4
out I don't have a what is it the

2648.96 --> 2653.4
polarized sheet so you can watch it

2662.319 --> 2672.089
yeah George is behind me right sitting

2669.609 --> 2672.089
right there

2685.04 --> 2688.04
anyway

2695.619 --> 2701.7690000000002
right yeah more colored the funny thing

2699.729 --> 2703.299
is yeah you have a good pointer thank

2701.769 --> 2707.799
you for actually getting into the

2703.299 --> 2709.299
subject the the idea of co2 originally

2707.799 --> 2713.14
the whole climate change where it

2709.299 --> 2717.369
started up with with greenhouse gas that

2713.14 --> 2719.859
it somehow changes the way the sun light

2717.369 --> 2720.969
is absorbed and reflected back and la

2719.859 --> 2725.229
blah blah of course

2720.969 --> 2728.7690000000002
globe modeled but it's pretty much

2725.229 --> 2731.5789999999997
nonsense because of that the original

2728.769 --> 2734.4399999999996
globe premise of course there's no yeah

2731.579 --> 2739.529
that's not how the sun is that's not how

2734.44 --> 2743.859
the earth works but also yeah co2 it

2739.529 --> 2752.71
it's a life-giving gas in a direct sense

2743.859 --> 2755.95
it's in in the carbon cycle so how could

2752.71 --> 2758.469
it ever build up so badly that it could

2755.95 --> 2763.1189999999997
do damage when there is literally a life

2758.469 --> 2767.049
force on the ground catching it as their

2763.119 --> 2769.63
own food and then get abilities to grow

2767.049 --> 2772.69
more if there's more so it's no sense

2769.63 --> 2775.2690000000002
into imagining that co2 would be the

2772.69 --> 2777.4
green out and get got greenhouse gas

2775.269 --> 2780.3999999999996
that would build up and build up because

2777.4 --> 2784.96
it doesn't it's a life gas or something

2780.4 --> 2789.15
in the world eats it braise the dinner

2784.96 --> 2793.93
and the more there is of it the more

2789.15 --> 2796.809
those things can breathe the plants so

2793.93 --> 2800.64
yeah and theoretically there may be

2796.809 --> 2804.279
another type of gas that could not be

2800.64 --> 2806.14
interacted with that could have such an

2804.279 --> 2809.14
effect and then yeah if you pump the

2806.14 --> 2811.8089999999997
atmosphere forward that [ __ ] yeah then

2809.14 --> 2813.4
it does atmosphere would be stuck with

2811.809 --> 2816.1600000000003
it and maybe then things would change

2813.4 --> 2818.4100000000003
for the worse but I don't think that's

2816.16 --> 2824.739
happening as far as I know there's no

2818.41 --> 2826.72
weird nonliving gas being injected in

2824.739 --> 2830.28
the atmosphere that doesn't naturally

2826.72 --> 2834.0699999999997
rise by itself and cannot be transformed

2830.28 --> 2838.7200000000003
like I think that even helium for

2834.07 --> 2845.53
example is transformed in the cycle

2838.72 --> 2848.74
somehow don't know exactly how that

2845.53 --> 2852.4
happens but I'm pretty sure that most of

2848.74 --> 2855.1499999999996
the common gases that are around just do

2852.4 --> 2855.15
get recycled

2867.429 --> 2875.359
huh yeah well nice trick question there

2872.029 --> 2879.13
reckoner Stefan hey listen as I said 200

2875.359 --> 2882.969
years ago there was a a ravaging

2879.13 --> 2884.779
destruction of nature because of the

2882.969 --> 2886.67
industrialization yeah that did a lot of

2884.779 --> 2890.17
damage we still pulled through though

2886.67 --> 2895.329
and since then

2890.17 --> 2895.329
Nature has caught up in ways as well

2919.53 --> 2923.4500000000003
that interview on the phone

2927.13 --> 2929.94
who knows

2932.22 --> 2937.04
any citation are you serious wreck where

2935.19 --> 2941.42
Stefan how listen you know the

2937.04 --> 2943.65
industrialization right it's been widely

2941.42 --> 2947.16
photographed even parts of it

2943.65 --> 2953.04
hysterically enough hysterical tragic

2947.16 --> 2955.3799999999997
whatever mysteriously but you know there

2953.04 --> 2961.5299999999997
was a huge nature destruction back then

2955.38 --> 2969.329
but since then okay nature is doing its

2961.53 --> 2972.3590000000004
own thing in response and I do

2969.329 --> 2976.2000000000003
definitely get the feeling that nature

2972.359 --> 2979.14
even in its own way finds new spots that

2976.2 --> 2982.4399999999996
were first devoid of life and did not

2979.14 --> 2985.17
have any one's interest that certainly

2982.44 --> 2990.11
just becomes viable ground and then

2985.17 --> 2993.2290000000003
nature starts reworking it

2990.11 --> 2993.2290000000003
[Music]

3005.95 --> 3018.91
and news about the algebra yeah yeah

3014.79 --> 3021.25
well to be fair there are long term

3018.91 --> 3025.56
issues with oceans it's like there's a

3021.25 --> 3031.75
lot a lot of catching up to do with

3025.56 --> 3034.7799999999997
ocean maintenance that's also why I have

3031.75 --> 3036.85
had ideas in that direction like things

3034.78 --> 3038.77
we could do because it's not over yet

3036.85 --> 3046.81
but as for the land situation it's

3038.77 --> 3050.89
really not that a lot of improvements

3046.81 --> 3052.93
have happened but the oceans yeah also

3050.89 --> 3056.74
of course with the oceans in general

3052.93 --> 3060.6699999999996
it's always a problem that all societies

3056.74 --> 3064.54
tend to end up dumping most of their

3060.67 --> 3066.91
waste or a lot of it especially the

3064.54 --> 3069.31
chemical or even human waste all that in

3066.91 --> 3072.22
the oceans with all the chemicals that

3069.31 --> 3077.83
come with it that is kind of an issue

3072.22 --> 3080.79
and but at the same time yet similar

3077.83 --> 3084.67
things have been going on for huge

3080.79 --> 3088.87
amounts of time and there's still a lot

3084.67 --> 3092.77
of ocean out there so it is a bit of a

3088.87 --> 3096.19
touchy subject but I don't know I have

3092.77 --> 3101.97
just a lot of faith in creation in the

3096.19 --> 3101.9700000000003
design a yellow jewel you Bennett

3128.27 --> 3137.109
yeah

3130.16 --> 3137.109
reckon Steffen Halverson good good

3138.759 --> 3143.049
let the plants catch on

3144.249 --> 3150.4399999999996
you do realize that more co2 is probably

3147.799 --> 3160.94
in general and I mean everywhere going

3150.44 --> 3163.279
to be better for for crops now of course

3160.94 --> 3165.38
they'd love to then overlay that

3163.279 --> 3167.9
suggestion with it's all going to

3165.38 --> 3173.119
extreme climate change and no droughts

3167.9 --> 3176.029
and floods and no I think in areas

3173.119 --> 3179.119
general areas it's just the extra co2 is

3176.029 --> 3181.999
just gonna help provide better crops I

3179.119 --> 3183.799
think that's the average effect as long

3181.999 --> 3186.43
as there's enough water because of

3183.799 --> 3190.339
course your two can only be transformed

3186.43 --> 3192.89
if there is enough water so of course

3190.339 --> 3197.66
more co2 intake also requires a little

3192.89 --> 3200.15
bit more water but yeah I think that can

3197.66 --> 3202.719
definitely be accounted for plans

3200.15 --> 3202.719
properly

3206.23 --> 3218.26
oh really Warren Evans what's what's

3213.76 --> 3223.2400000000002
your proof for that did you hear a new

3218.26 --> 3226.51
story about it sounds more like more

3223.24 --> 3229.6899999999996
Fairport it's just like people are just

3226.51 --> 3233.59
looking out there for some reason to

3229.69 --> 3238.2400000000002
assume it's all going to die is that

3233.59 --> 3240.4900000000002
some kind of necessity to find that kind

3238.24 --> 3244.5699999999997
of thing out there so you can just oh

3240.49 --> 3248.2799999999997
god I need to find something quick so I

3244.57 --> 3255.4300000000003
could just give up is that it

3248.28 --> 3257.77
it's pathetic and it's not wise it

3255.43 --> 3260.9199999999996
doesn't show you understand creation

3257.77 --> 3267.22
it's just escapism because it's too much

3260.92 --> 3276.1
those just gotta just gotta be have that

3267.22 --> 3278.2599999999998
little fixation of of doom yeah yeah

3276.1 --> 3280.63
more color yeah Ragnar Stefan hey listen

3278.26 --> 3283.2400000000002
you know that the people that generally

3280.63 --> 3286.96
pump out these types of messages right

3283.24 --> 3289.06
in media you know what they also do they

3286.96 --> 3292.36
also tell you every now and then oh my

3289.06 --> 3299.2599999999998
god there is a giant meteor coming again

3292.36 --> 3302.6200000000003
or just past the earth or ah be afraid

3299.26 --> 3303.1600000000003
could hit any moment and then it's all

3302.62 --> 3308.35
over

3303.16 --> 3314.0099999999998
yeah it's the same corner it's an

3308.35 --> 3314.0099999999998
industry it's called fear porn industry

3314.07 --> 3317.31
wake up

3334.47 --> 3337.6
[Music]

3339.89 --> 3346.1
yeah haven't heard that I see it all the

3344.07 --> 3346.1000000000004
time

3360.99 --> 3367.8199999999997
no Nathan Oakley I'm pouring in tea and

3364.67 --> 3367.82
drinking it

3394.7 --> 3403.8199999999997
all right

3397.5 --> 3407.13
yeah well the even I get it

3403.82 --> 3411.15
thanks Nathan a thanks for handing the

3407.13 --> 3414.57
Heath and something [ __ ] to use as a

3411.15 --> 3420.29
red herring after everything that he

3414.57 --> 3420.29
asked and I responded with thanks

3432.9 --> 3439.6800000000003
right well Warren Evans have any

3436.249 --> 3444.48
empirical demonstration of that Kenya

3439.68 --> 3446.3999999999996
can you please demonstrate that in a

3444.48 --> 3450.15
piece of the ocean

3446.4 --> 3454.4990000000003
can you please demonstrate that show us

3450.15 --> 3457.529
the proof Warren Evans or did you just

3454.499 --> 3461.64
hear it did somebody tell you a story

3457.529 --> 3471.69
about yeah this is definitely going on

3461.64 --> 3475.5789999999997
mmm yes I did see that nonsense Nathan

3471.69 --> 3478.049
Oakley I saw it all of it let's just

3475.579 --> 3487.4300000000003
don't see why you need to insert that

3478.049 --> 3487.43
here oh really

3494.12 --> 3501.7999999999997
cool Oh Warren Evans where where was

3498.05 --> 3505.55
that sampled can you show me the

3501.8 --> 3509.27
statistics and how that was determined

3505.55 --> 3511.9
or is it just some graph somebody showed

3509.27 --> 3511.9
you and

3515.88 --> 3520.44
all right also I'm pretty sure there's

3518.099 --> 3523.259
been other periods where there was there

3520.44 --> 3528.93
where the acidity of the oceans have

3523.259 --> 3531.0190000000002
changed gone back and forth so I don't

3528.93 --> 3531.019
know

3533.479 --> 3541.1299999999997
got any more claims about how we're

3537.479 --> 3541.1299999999997
destroying everything

3557.16 --> 3565.0789999999997
ha - look the link from the Smithsonian

3560.48 --> 3568.98
the Smithsonian that's excellent because

3565.079 --> 3572.7000000000003
yeah we can definitely definitely rely

3568.98 --> 3575.94
on an organization that's traditionally

3572.7 --> 3580.89
known to specifically uphold [ __ ]

3575.94 --> 3582.809
[ __ ] historical machinations for us so

3580.89 --> 3585.359
they're definitely the ones to trust

3582.809 --> 3589.3390000000004
when it comes to what the converse you

3585.359 --> 3589.339
know if our climate is so reliable

3589.4 --> 3595.98
they're definitely going to be honest

3591.809 --> 3599.0890000000004
like they were with dinosaurs and and

3595.98 --> 3599.089
everything you know

3602.79 --> 3606.35
cuz they get it right

3609.76 --> 3615.84
oh really what weren't happens what do

3613.45 --> 3617.3199999999997
you even know what my claim is

3615.84 --> 3619.54
concerning all this

3617.32 --> 3624.2200000000003
do you even know do you even realize car

3619.54 --> 3628.06
are you just digging for more yeah

3624.22 --> 3630.1299999999997
nonsense examples out there rumors that

3628.06 --> 3632.65
you heard and then you try to attack me

3630.13 --> 3635.9500000000003
with to take away that hope that there's

3632.65 --> 3640.1800000000003
somehow it could all be balanced because

3635.95 --> 3642.3999999999996
it can't no it must be in a way that

3640.18 --> 3646.27
we're all gonna die somehow because of

3642.4 --> 3650.5
our existence doesn't it it must be like

3646.27 --> 3656.34
that in some way right because how could

3650.5 --> 3660.88
things possibly be balanced it's no way

3656.34 --> 3662.8900000000003
yeah that's my claim my claim is no it's

3660.88 --> 3665.08
pretty much fine things do change

3662.89 --> 3668.47
sometimes by humans a little and

3665.08 --> 3671.95
sometimes a lot and then there's a

3668.47 --> 3675.58
response and then things do balance out

3671.95 --> 3678.22
or how could we have existed in the

3675.58 --> 3681.25
first place in this age after everything

3678.22 --> 3689.5899999999997
that we've supposedly been through it's

3681.25 --> 3691.69
nonsense you have no proof you have just

3689.59 --> 3695.71
a lot of white claims saying move this

3691.69 --> 3698.53
Happold atom this and then just your

3695.71 --> 3700.84
speculation nonsense about how that is

3698.53 --> 3703.3590000000004
gonna create the doom and it of course

3700.84 --> 3706.3900000000003
must have directly been created by the

3703.359 --> 3708.8199999999997
things that you must have done because

3706.39 --> 3713.609
you have so much proof or that right no

3708.82 --> 3720.07
no wait it's just raw speculation that

3713.609 --> 3723.96
any testing really it's just derived

3720.07 --> 3723.96
nonsense nonsense claims

3728.28 --> 3740.73
show my evidence well Warren Evans walk

3733.32 --> 3743.34
outside it's all their plans live grow

3740.73 --> 3746.67
go through the season cycle animals go

3743.34 --> 3750.6600000000003
around some flourish some go through

3746.67 --> 3754.4
tough periods and then diversify in some

3750.66 --> 3757.3799999999997
other way and we're all still going and

3754.4 --> 3758.82
yeah some issues here but they guess

3757.38 --> 3761.04
what turns out that a lot of these

3758.82 --> 3764.54
issues actually come from well basically

3761.04 --> 3769.109
poison that's being fed to us and that's

3764.54 --> 3773.13
empirically proven so where is just walk

3769.109 --> 3776.66
outside it's all fine despite everything

3773.13 --> 3776.6600000000003
we've supposedly been through

3785.48 --> 3790.43
hey where you are and you walk outside

3788.51 --> 3794.48
and it looks like a giant trash heap

3790.43 --> 3799.39
well yeah that's that's not very

3794.48 --> 3803.9900000000002
encouraging of course but technically

3799.39 --> 3809.6299999999997
you could do something about that figure

3803.99 --> 3813.7099999999996
it out I bent over the idea how to get

3809.63 --> 3815.6600000000003
away the trash how to stop it from just

3813.71 --> 3819.98
being trash that is in the way and keeps

3815.66 --> 3829.1189999999997
piling on I've Unleashed my mind on that

3819.98 --> 3829.119
concept widely cuz we're supposed to

3831.16 --> 3835.5099999999998
we'd be idiots not to do it

3858.66 --> 3869.0589999999997
no Warren Evans I think my evidence for

3862.41 --> 3874.609
my claim was pretty well substantiated

3869.059 --> 3874.6090000000004
because it is all still there is it not

3875.089 --> 3884.7889999999998
how many species have you witnessed in

3880.049 --> 3886.92
your lifetime dying out and I mean like

3884.789 --> 3889.44
literally they were present and then

3886.92 --> 3891.66
certainly no more of these it's gone all

3889.44 --> 3894.4500000000003
of it never seeing them again how many

3891.66 --> 3896.8799999999997
of that have you personally witnessed

3894.45 --> 3899.8489999999997
Warren Evans in your lifetime I know you

3896.88 --> 3902.2400000000002
heard these stories of course of course

3899.849 --> 3908.6090000000004
you heard the stories how much have you

3902.24 --> 3915.47
actually witnessed that's my proof walk

3908.609 --> 3915.47
outside take a good look it's all there

3931.88 --> 3935.889
[Music]

3952.78 --> 3959.1400000000003
Oh what I need a citation really the

3957.04 --> 3964.54
citation is the only thing that can

3959.14 --> 3970.0899999999997
prove anything are you serious I just

3964.54 --> 3972.34
gave you an example a wide example that

3970.09 --> 3974.53
you could personally reflect upon and

3972.34 --> 3978.58
then you say you have to give your

3974.53 --> 3992.4100000000003
citation that that was the citation I

3978.58 --> 3995.08
said it figure it out no no Warren Evans

3992.41 --> 3997.21
you're the ones with just the claim you

3995.08 --> 4000.42
made several claims like four or five

3997.21 --> 4004.41
and I asked you to actually back those

4000.42 --> 4006.9300000000003
claims up and you didn't you're just

4004.41 --> 4011.1299999999997
being a ball wanker

4006.93 --> 4014.0099999999998
Warren Evans and I don't think you're

4011.13 --> 4017.48
gonna have a long history in my chat if

4014.01 --> 4017.48
you keep this nonsense up

4028.68 --> 4033.74
the links what links there's no links

4049.35 --> 4058.56
it's just a bunch of sayings no this is

4051.78 --> 4062.07
going to own acidic OCU to is to prove

4058.56 --> 4063.9
it you heard the story yeah I heard a

4062.07 --> 4066.75
lot of stories - you know but I'm not

4063.9 --> 4069.81
just gonna be a [ __ ] [ __ ] and then

4066.75 --> 4073.44
claim like that is proof like a ball

4069.81 --> 4075.48
hard and every freaking occasion because

4073.44 --> 4077.9700000000003
they need those false chips of

4075.48 --> 4081.11
scientific legitimacy because they're

4077.97 --> 4081.1099999999997
[ __ ] retards

4096.409 --> 4104.69
all right yeah sky's the limit that's

4098.929 --> 4108.799
right and now there it look things

4104.69 --> 4110.21
change around so it is kind of I watch a

4108.799 --> 4113.359
little bit of attention but like for

4110.21 --> 4116.81
example the Great Barrier Reef that

4113.359 --> 4120.589
thing is kind of declining that is true

4116.81 --> 4123.7390000000005
but that's not like the only coral it's

4120.589 --> 4129.94
just one of the more interesting things

4123.739 --> 4129.94
out there but things do change like that

4130.299 --> 4134.44
doesn't mean it's all dying

4140.779 --> 4154.22
no I don't see the links now okay okay

4151.73 --> 4157.19
put out your links again I'm giving you

4154.22 --> 4159.400000000001
a wrench just to do that [ __ ] better be

4157.19 --> 4159.4
good

4163.799 --> 4170.339
but your links out Warren Evans is that

4168.18 --> 4171.06
the one it's there more on National

4170.339 --> 4174.72
Geographic

4171.06 --> 4181.35
oh my god super reliable same channel

4174.72 --> 4183.75
that puts out ancient aliens tastic okay

4181.35 --> 4188.120000000001
that is it is that your link Warren

4183.75 --> 4192.45
Evans really that a National Geographic

4188.12 --> 4196.26
thing that's it you're you're actually

4192.45 --> 4198.98
gonna give that to me as some kind of

4196.26 --> 4198.9800000000005
empirical evidence

4203.62 --> 4210.96
I don't even know what the fadna yukl is

4207.12 --> 4210.96
Ragnar Stefan Allison

4214.6 --> 4225.0
okay we're in Evans was that it yeah

4221.92 --> 4225.0
thought so

4231.67 --> 4238.57
Oh a government website a government

4236.53 --> 4239.849999999999
website telling us about climate change

4238.57 --> 4246.36
Wow

4239.85 --> 4252.01
well now there's that's just fantastic

4246.36 --> 4256.54
such a big piece too it's like four

4252.01 --> 4260.08
sentences three of which have question

4256.54 --> 4263.31
marks in the title for the sentence are

4260.08 --> 4263.3099999999995
you serious

4270.309 --> 4279.659000000001
and look at that that's the graph one

4274.539 --> 4284.44
little freaking graph between 1985 and

4279.659 --> 4290.32
2010 and scholars how is that gonna

4284.44 --> 4296.669999999999
prove anything the acidity of the ocean

4290.32 --> 4296.67
does change over time even naturally so

4299.73 --> 4303.15
doesn't prove anything

4310.63 --> 4317.53
yeah see

4321.239 --> 4327.87
more proof then then I have oh really so

4324.39 --> 4330.39
my actual out there live example and

4327.87 --> 4332.94
personal question about what species

4330.39 --> 4336.18
you've seen die out in your lifetime

4332.94 --> 4340.5599999999995
personally witnessed the change that

4336.18 --> 4344.91
that's not good enough for you I have to

4340.56 --> 4348.56
put give you a link to an article that

4344.91 --> 4351.12
tells you in four sentences this is true

4348.56 --> 4356.9890000000005
so that would that be good enough for

4351.12 --> 4356.989
you Warren Evans you're freaking [ __ ]

4357.2 --> 4361.37
the [ __ ] is wrong with you

4370.03 --> 4373.16
[Music]

4383.09 --> 4391.75
all right yeah glaciers melt all the

4385.82 --> 4395.24
time mark colored it's called seasons oh

4391.75 --> 4397.6
yeah the melt then they grow back again

4395.24 --> 4400.79
then they melt and they grow back again

4397.6 --> 4402.860000000001
and they grow back again and sometimes

4400.79 --> 4406.16
they grow back a little less and

4402.86 --> 4409.82
sometimes they grow back a lot more and

4406.16 --> 4415.69
then they melt again it's just what's

4409.82 --> 4415.69
the point yeah ice melts

4425.4 --> 4434.36
you know no George Sanford don't burn

4431.25 --> 4439.35
tires that's terrible

4434.36 --> 4441.66
tires are just massively toxic pollution

4439.35 --> 4447.09
if you start burning that is terrible

4441.66 --> 4450.9
don't do that you know would fine oil

4447.09 --> 4451.9800000000005
can be okay depends on type of oil we'll

4450.9 --> 4456.889999999999
look into that

4451.98 --> 4456.889999999999
tired don't do that it's disgusting

4477.479 --> 4484.689
hmm okay that's an interesting concept

4481.51 --> 4486.729
more colored but yeah still you're

4484.689 --> 4491.92
claiming we're coming out of an ice age

4486.729 --> 4495.309
for huge ice I don't know some kind of

4491.92 --> 4497.769
sick locality to the the changes yeah I

4495.309 --> 4504.719
could go with it but I don't see the

4497.769 --> 4504.719
direct evidence of that really but

4514.089 --> 4522.399
yet worn ovens I asked you a specific

4517.589 --> 4526.829
question stop straw Manning my question

4522.399 --> 4530.919000000001
I don't want a freaking list of data

4526.829 --> 4535.768999999999
supposedly being handed to you I asked

4530.919 --> 4539.769
you what did you see in your lifetime

4535.769 --> 4544.059
personally with your eyes in your life

4539.769 --> 4548.349
you go about what animal did you see

4544.059 --> 4556.1990000000005
disappear forever that's my question not

4548.349 --> 4556.1990000000005
some freakin list so pathetic

4561.709 --> 4568.929
yeah Warren Evans no well there might be

4570.34 --> 4579.499
like a small type of bird that's kind of

4574.76 --> 4584.409000000001
gone away slept out there sometimes they

4579.499 --> 4587.78
do but the weird thing about is is that

4584.409 --> 4590.179
when it kind of happens like that in in

4587.78 --> 4592.67
the nature people that actually care

4590.179 --> 4596.959
about nature it's kind of a mystery as

4592.67 --> 4599.3
to even why the dodo oh really

4596.959 --> 4603.199
you saw the dodo died out in your

4599.3 --> 4603.619000000001
lifetime like to see some proof or that

4603.199 --> 4607.848999999999
buddy

4603.619 --> 4613.209
I don't even know if it ever really

4607.849 --> 4613.209
existed might have I don't know

4621.15 --> 4628.799999999999
no but it's the premise Warren Evans the

4625.11 --> 4632.7
premise of this entire discussion just

4628.8 --> 4638.01
call it a discussion is about it's all

4632.7 --> 4641.94
dying the change caused assumedly by

4638.01 --> 4643.95
humans that is out of balance the

4641.94 --> 4645.69
creation does not account for that in

4643.95 --> 4647.58
these people's opinion because they

4645.69 --> 4649.469999999999
believe in pure chaos and that's all

4647.58 --> 4657.93
just gonna blow up at some point really

4649.47 --> 4660.9800000000005
that's what it comes down to right I got

4657.93 --> 4660.9800000000005
lost in my own

4670.56 --> 4675.42
you don't see it them it's not happening

4673.02 --> 4678.21
right well in a way yes if they're

4675.42 --> 4683.61
Masari continuing my point if you don't

4678.21 --> 4688.53
see things literally changing then how

4683.61 --> 4693.5
do you know that that is real or that

4688.53 --> 4697.889999999999
that is caused by human influence again

4693.5 --> 4700.17
I've seen followed through that I think

4697.89 --> 4702.990000000001
a couple of smaller birds kind of like

4700.17 --> 4705.51
disappeared but it was never really

4702.99 --> 4707.88
understood why it wasn't like oh my god

4705.51 --> 4711.360000000001
the humans it's because the humans did

4707.88 --> 4713.55
this no they're all dead no it's just

4711.36 --> 4715.0199999999995
like what happened to these birds it's

4713.55 --> 4722.01
just yeah we don't see it anymore

4715.02 --> 4727.77
hmm I saw an Ewok once that's special

4722.01 --> 4730.41
DANC it's very special yeah but my point

4727.77 --> 4733.2300000000005
is is that this entire discussion is

4730.41 --> 4735.71
about that it's gonna revoke ibly change

4733.23 --> 4739.889999999999
in one direction because of chaos and

4735.71 --> 4742.29
well there is just no empirical proof

4739.89 --> 4744.33
for this it's all pretty damn balanced

4742.29 --> 4749.64
even if there are things changing and

4744.33 --> 4752.79
there's just no absolute proof that even

4749.64 --> 4755.400000000001
the changes that we do cause provably so

4752.79 --> 4759.08
that it is gonna lead to so some

4755.4 --> 4759.08
irrevocable Cataclysm

4767.07 --> 4774.239
like yeah look if you're gonna literally

4770.369 --> 4777.808999999999
dump horrendous toxic waste for no good

4774.239 --> 4779.518999999999
reason in on a mass scale in the ocean

4777.809 --> 4781.889
or something yeah of course that's gonna

4779.519 --> 4785.820000000001
just that's just like a giant oil

4781.889 --> 4789.78
disaster yeah that [ __ ] [ __ ] up that

4785.82 --> 4792.119
doesn't mean the end like even raw oil

4789.78 --> 4793.829
spills and [ __ ] it's like oh my god

4792.119 --> 4796.079
everything's gonna die look at all the

4793.829 --> 4798.96
birds with all the crap on them and all

4796.079 --> 4801.558999999999
the fishies died yes terrible but at the

4798.96 --> 4805.949
same time the oceans actually do have

4801.559 --> 4809.46
their own metabolism and it eats the raw

4805.949 --> 4812.28
oil eventually by itself really you

4809.46 --> 4815.219
could potentially help it or make it a

4812.28 --> 4818.219
lot worse dumping much more toxic [ __ ]

4815.219 --> 4821.909
on it to make it sink to the bottom like

4818.219 --> 4828.44
they did in the in the Mexican Gulf I

4821.909 --> 4828.44
think but nature actually can eat it

4828.679 --> 4831.889
over time

4836.35 --> 4845.2300000000005
it's more the refined stuff that becomes

4840.01 --> 4847.71
hard to metabolize that's what I

4845.23 --> 4850.24
understand of it mostly but anyway

4847.71 --> 4854.28
there's better expert to tackle the

4850.24 --> 4854.28
specific T's of those subjects

4860.27 --> 4866.81
what's your proof for that and and how

4864.68 --> 4871.25
would you know that it is because of the

4866.81 --> 4875.26
natural things that we even do in an age

4871.25 --> 4878.12
when there's chemtrails and admitted

4875.26 --> 4882.68
geoengineering experimentation going on

4878.12 --> 4885.71
for 25 years how can you exclude that

4882.68 --> 4888.92
that which was specifically designed to

4885.71 --> 4890.81
alter weather and [ __ ] from being the

4888.92 --> 4894.53
cause of the stronger hurricanes how can

4890.81 --> 4897.59
you blame human regular activity and

4894.53 --> 4900.92
industry on that are you an idiot

4897.59 --> 4909.860000000001
are you seriously gonna ignore that in

4900.92 --> 4912.7390000000005
the face the situation the record true

4909.86 --> 4915.98
you can't really use your spraying

4912.739 --> 4918.049999999999
there's no geoengineering program and

4915.98 --> 4920.87
it's not out there it's not admittedly

4918.05 --> 4923.96
so put out there with descriptions on

4920.87 --> 4926.71
websites officially admitted and funded

4923.96 --> 4930.92
for 25 freakin years

4926.71 --> 4933.62
you idiots these countries just

4930.92 --> 4936.65
countries just watch your nose no

4933.62 --> 4945.469
nothing left behind snot waving apart

4936.65 --> 4949.54
it's nothing hmm yes dari sig does the

4945.469 --> 4949.54
bet you do what dinosaurs of Scotland

4949.84 --> 4952.84
yes

4959.929 --> 4965.969
there are cloud seeding but not on the

4964.11 --> 4971.369
scale you think also there are

4965.969 --> 4974.849
chemtrails then Warren Evans so it's not

4971.369 --> 4978.9
on the scale I think even though yeah

4974.849 --> 4981.84
people around the world literally see

4978.9 --> 4983.28
chemtrails on a daily basis on video and

4981.84 --> 4985.860000000001
put it on the Internet

4983.28 --> 4988.889
mm-hmm I think it is kind of on a bigger

4985.86 --> 4990.839999999999
scale and even the program is kind of

4988.889 --> 4995.369
say it is on a bigger scale

4990.84 --> 4998.63
so let's just bypass that and look at

4995.369 --> 5002.03
that you're actually it is real and

4998.63 --> 5003.139
right so yeah they do do that exactly

5002.03 --> 5005.42
like they say they do

5003.139 --> 5011.9890000000005
you think that could have any influence

5005.42 --> 5015.679
on the weather escape hmm could it could

5011.989 --> 5018.018999999999
it be that a weather alteration program

5015.679 --> 5022.849
actually has a influence on the weather

5018.019 --> 5026.570000000001
I think there's a bigger likelihood of

5022.849 --> 5030.59
that being the cause of weather

5026.57 --> 5033.949
extremities alterations unusualness then

5030.59 --> 5035.42
just the general activity of humans and

5033.949 --> 5040.909
Industry really

5035.42 --> 5044.869
I don't know usually things specifically

5040.909 --> 5048.049999999999
designed to create alterations in a

5044.869 --> 5050.389
specific area tend to be the cause of

5048.05 --> 5053.63
these specific alterations in the

5050.389 --> 5057.159000000001
specific area but I don't know maybe

5053.63 --> 5057.159000000001
that's too far-fetched for you

5062.45 --> 5069.66
[Music]

5064.2 --> 5069.66
yeah I need more tea I'll be a ride back

5226.489 --> 5229.15
yeah

5229.86 --> 5233.119
sorry for the delay

5241.76 --> 5244.479
what's been happening

5249.5 --> 5252.5
right

5256.66 --> 5259.71
[Music]

5263.47 --> 5271.22
yeah let's get back to a question Warren

5267.53 --> 5274.48
Evans because he's in full baller mode

5271.22 --> 5277.55
concerning this now just fall out and

5274.48 --> 5281.8099999999995
I'll take him on and I'll keep on going

5277.55 --> 5285.650000000001
and keep on slamming him until he turns

5281.81 --> 5289.79
to similar retardation level as Brenda

5285.65 --> 5290.42
is used to because he will I know we

5289.79 --> 5294.14
will

5290.42 --> 5297.74
right so cloud seeding right what is

5294.14 --> 5300.29
cloud seeding because you asked me so

5297.74 --> 5304.13
cloud seeding is spreading particles

5300.29 --> 5307.28
that will actually form clouds thereby

5304.13 --> 5310.55
altering the weather condition in a

5307.28 --> 5315.7699999999995
region when naturally it would not have

5310.55 --> 5319.01
that and that changes yeah a part of the

5315.77 --> 5321.2300000000005
overall weather system and now there's

5319.01 --> 5322.820000000001
been experiments with it widely and it's

5321.23 --> 5327.32
getting better understood because of it

5322.82 --> 5331.429999999999
but yeah the influence is there so with

5327.32 --> 5334.969999999999
all this temporary tempering the typical

5331.43 --> 5341.2300000000005
natural unfolding of the weather how do

5334.97 --> 5344.33
you expect it not to have unforeseen

5341.23 --> 5346.429999999999
consequences potentially enhance certain

5344.33 --> 5350.21
things or them down other things how

5346.43 --> 5353.09
could you not foresee such things

5350.21 --> 5354.86
arriving it seems like the very purpose

5353.09 --> 5359.06
of the experimentation in the first

5354.86 --> 5361.19
place to see what happens when you do

5359.06 --> 5364.85
that can it be under control what kind

5361.19 --> 5368.0599999999995
of thing and mean whatever whatever else

5364.85 --> 5371.06
and motivations are there so yeah that's

5368.06 --> 5374.330000000001
cloud seeding you create clouds with

5371.06 --> 5376.88
dust and all that and changes what

5374.33 --> 5381.26
happens in the region and that alters

5376.88 --> 5386.42
just the overall dynamics locally and

5381.26 --> 5388.72
that has a unpredictable often long-term

5386.42 --> 5392.71
effect

5388.72 --> 5392.71
so that's cloud seeding

5393.3 --> 5411.42
anything else yeah I'm and a young eye

5404.43 --> 5414.31
I'm gonna keep on going going and going

5411.42 --> 5416.77
yesterday I I rounded out the show

5414.31 --> 5418.42
pretty and a good point but I really

5416.77 --> 5420.43
afterward felt like damn I could

5418.42 --> 5424.14
probably run for two more hours or

5420.43 --> 5424.14
something why not

5435.04 --> 5443.239
chemicals well Warren Evans particles

5440.02 --> 5446.719
yeah the condemned will be proven how

5443.239 --> 5451.2699999999995
could you not understand that that if

5446.719 --> 5454.1
there's literally an output some kind

5451.27 --> 5456.5
it's going to show and it's not gonna

5454.1 --> 5460.070000000001
evaporate it's just gonna sit there as

5456.5 --> 5462.23
is that means it's not dissolving so

5460.07 --> 5464.75
either it is a substance that does not

5462.23 --> 5467.53
dissolve in air properly on the best

5464.75 --> 5473.739
temperature conditions or whatever or

5467.53 --> 5478.16
it's literally none ya know fluid

5473.739 --> 5482.45
particles that then attract whatever is

5478.16 --> 5485.62
in the area moist things and then do

5482.45 --> 5485.62
things with that

5495.449 --> 5502.37
so it's just logical what else could

5498.6 --> 5508.77
cause that just water doesn't do that

5502.37 --> 5511.5
and hey I even say literally the plains

5508.77 --> 5514.35
are not always fraying Cantrell's very

5511.5 --> 5516.66
clearly seems to be very specific times

5514.35 --> 5518.969
when that kind of thing is activated and

5516.66 --> 5522.51
then a lot do it not every plane even

5518.969 --> 5523.55
but still a lot it's timed in some way

5522.51 --> 5526.29
for a reason

5523.55 --> 5529.89
coordination whatever the program the

5526.29 --> 5532.14
testing program but yeah when they don't

5529.89 --> 5539.4890000000005
leave trails when the trail quickly

5532.14 --> 5541.92
dissolves say five planes lengths behind

5539.489 --> 5543.629999999999
it it completely dissolves it becomes

5541.92 --> 5546.4800000000005
invisible yeah then you could say it's a

5543.63 --> 5549.39
contrail because there's no no remnant

5546.48 --> 5549.839999999999
there's no alteration there's nothing

5549.39 --> 5554.06
left

5549.84 --> 5557.64
it just completely dissolves there's no

5554.06 --> 5559.9490000000005
yeah unusual coloring because of it

5557.64 --> 5563.01
and there's no haze blocking sunlight

5559.949 --> 5565.29
nothing then you could say okay that's a

5563.01 --> 5566.9400000000005
contrail but when it doesn't do that and

5565.29 --> 5568.41
keeps on hanging around for hours and

5566.94 --> 5570.33
hours and hours and certainly in the

5568.41 --> 5573.51
night or in the evening there's a huge

5570.33 --> 5576.8099999999995
cloud blocking everything yeah that

5573.51 --> 5578.52
that's not just moist that was sprayed

5576.81 --> 5580.85
there that can't be that doesn't work

5578.52 --> 5580.85
that way

5583.77 --> 5591.320000000001
it dissolves Warren Evans it dissolves

5611.31 --> 5622.97
this guy's not even trying to understand

5613.8 --> 5622.97
what I'm saying I collect my tea

5669.48 --> 5675.5289999999995
[Music]

5685.47 --> 5692.67
yeah jet engines Warren Evans yeah what

5688.9 --> 5692.67
jet engines are definitely different

5699.36 --> 5708.839999999999
and they they propel the very air inside

5705.77 --> 5712.5
basically pull itself through the air

5708.84 --> 5715.91
like that and if you turn on the turbo

5712.5 --> 5719.46
then they also inject basically sort of

5715.91 --> 5721.44
extra burning fuel to give you an extra

5719.46 --> 5726.83
push and that actually leaves a lot of

5721.44 --> 5726.83
like trash behind

5744.559 --> 5751.46
but yeah military vehicles rarely do

5747.59 --> 5753.409000000001
that unless it's like a combat situation

5751.46 --> 5756.01
and it makes so much noise when they do

5753.409 --> 5756.009999999999
that anyway

5782.099 --> 5787.1900000000005
hmm interesting George Sanford

5795.93 --> 5807.91
[ __ ] off Warren Evans don't be an idiot

5802.84 --> 5813.76
World War two planes had so much junk

5807.91 --> 5815.8
output like literal burned oil and the

5813.76 --> 5818.38
materials were very raw so there was a

5815.8 --> 5820.3
lot of smoke and [ __ ] that's what it

5818.38 --> 5822.55
left behind to suggest that they were

5820.3 --> 5824.320000000001
like chem trailing is kind of silly they

5822.55 --> 5826.93
could have done that but it's not the

5824.32 --> 5829.349999999999
default of what you saw just planes

5826.93 --> 5833.14
leave freaking smoke plumes back then

5829.35 --> 5835.63
it's different engines plane engines

5833.14 --> 5837.96
don't work like that anymore now a lot

5835.63 --> 5837.96
cleaner

5845.449 --> 5851.29
ragnar Stefan hey listen I should ban

5847.73 --> 5855.53
you for that question after all this

5851.29 --> 5858.62
can't believe can't believe you'd say

5855.53 --> 5863.599999999999
that after this point why do you think

5858.62 --> 5866.349999999999
it's a hoax Jesus Christ spoke over an

5863.6 --> 5866.35
hour about it

5883.37 --> 5886.15
right

5886.39 --> 5892.37
you know what I'd almost be inclined to

5889.61 --> 5896.12
instead of just climate change with this

5892.37 --> 5898.099999999999
which is just absurdly universal why

5896.12 --> 5904.34
don't you just call it climate climate

5898.1 --> 5907.43
adaptation just because it asymmetrical

5904.34 --> 5909.38
change is extremely unlikely so it's

5907.43 --> 5911.51
just got to be in a direction and the

5909.38 --> 5914.03
things adapt and then changes another

5911.51 --> 5917.650000000001
direction again it's the natural

5914.03 --> 5917.65
dynamics of this realm

5930.959 --> 5939.469
climate season right well there's then

5935.669 --> 5943.459
there's just the seasons themselves

5939.469 --> 5947.999
climate see what climate cycle maybe

5943.459 --> 5950.489
it's look almost everything even

5947.999 --> 5952.679
concerning the celestial bodies and just

5950.489 --> 5954.928999999999
the Seas and all that it's all cyclical

5952.679 --> 5956.61
so there's bind to be cycles all over

5954.929 --> 5959.599
the place everything's gonna be cyclical

5956.61 --> 5963.57
everybody everything's going to be

5959.599 --> 5965.369000000001
gradually changing in some direction but

5963.57 --> 5966.719
there's no reason to assume that it

5965.369 --> 5969.478999999999
would go out of control

5966.719 --> 5971.519
any of the changes that it would spike

5969.479 --> 5972.51
up into infinity somehow that doesn't

5971.519 --> 5975.030000000001
make any sense

5972.51 --> 5977.269
change yeah the climate cycle I like

5975.03 --> 5977.268999999999
that

5983.699 --> 5988.83
you know what I'm actually gonna name

5986.429 --> 6007.06
the hangout climate cycle I really like

5988.83 --> 6007.0599999999995
that yeah it's a good one

6043.81 --> 6048.9400000000005
yeah it's not funny because the cycle

6046.66 --> 6053.099999999999
immediately puts it in a logical

6048.94 --> 6057.7
balanced framework and takes away the

6053.1 --> 6061.6
potential unhinged element of change you

6057.7 --> 6066.94
know look we all know now that demanding

6061.6 --> 6072.700000000001
change doesn't always result in the and

6066.94 --> 6075.46
what you would expect the cycle gives a

6072.7 --> 6078.7
much better framework as to what it even

6075.46 --> 6083.25
is I like it the climate's icon is I'm

6078.7 --> 6083.25
gonna try to keep that in

6091.469 --> 6096.53
no George Sanford I have no idea what

6093.96 --> 6096.53
you're talking about

6115.699 --> 6121.509999999999
yeah don't just

6131.51 --> 6138.88
it's a decoration stop being disgusting

6143.71 --> 6151.03
now it's a real thing

6146.66 --> 6151.03
but I'm using it as decoration that's it

6152.71 --> 6161.42
all right you were talking about a jet

6155.51 --> 6165.31
engine mm-hmm I'm not super interested

6161.42 --> 6165.31
but thanks for the offer

6188.999 --> 6192.44
and yeah that's right cone

6205.329 --> 6211.579
yeah wouldn't that just be extremely

6208.249 --> 6214.249
ironic if at some point well it's a

6211.579 --> 6217.07
terrible scenario so let's not imagine

6214.249 --> 6219.86
that it would work like that but that

6217.07 --> 6221.869
they'd get through the co2 nonsense that

6219.86 --> 6224.63
at some point people that have

6221.869 --> 6230.119
greenhouses would literally have to buy

6224.63 --> 6233.2390000000005
co2 to help their plants and then even

6230.119 --> 6234.71
pay extra taxes because it's co2 even

6233.239 --> 6236.03
though they're doing it to help plants

6234.71 --> 6239.059
and it's literally all going to be

6236.03 --> 6242.539
absorbed by the plants that's what

6239.059 --> 6246.409000000001
they'll do it they'll do whatever they

6242.539 --> 6251.268999999999
can it'll all be total 180 degrees

6246.409 --> 6255.699
reality in your face pure slavery if

6251.269 --> 6255.6990000000005
they get people to do this

6259.179 --> 6270.85
don't do it reject with the utmost

6265.63 --> 6279.51
urgency climate change policies based on

6270.85 --> 6279.51
co2 production utterly reject

6298.81 --> 6305.240000000001
industrial pollution right well

6302.03 --> 6308.75
pollution pollution of the ground and

6305.24 --> 6311.24
the water and all that that is a general

6308.75 --> 6314.0
universal problem every time even as

6311.24 --> 6318.469999999999
industry develop as chemistry develops

6314.0 --> 6321.11
it always remains a problem it's going

6318.47 --> 6323.18
to be forever so that is one of the

6321.11 --> 6326.87
biggest challenges for environmentalists

6323.18 --> 6329.570000000001
to really get that sorted you don't get

6326.87 --> 6332.18
it sorted by just getting rid of all

6329.57 --> 6333.889999999999
industry entirely use its gonna solve it

6332.18 --> 6335.6
because there's no yeah and then

6333.89 --> 6337.25
everything's gonna collapse and then

6335.6 --> 6340.22
it's gonna get much much worse and

6337.25 --> 6342.44
suddenly things were carefully

6340.22 --> 6344.63
maintained are just gonna be sacrificed

6342.44 --> 6346.4
all right brutally everything to just

6344.63 --> 6350.09
vie for something so is that really

6346.4 --> 6353.99
sensible thing to do no you keep on

6350.09 --> 6357.14
going focus with your environmentalism

6353.99 --> 6363.26
on the actual pollution the actual

6357.14 --> 6364.700000000001
chemistry the waste that is where it

6363.26 --> 6368.35
should be focused that's where our fire

6364.7 --> 6368.349999999999
mentalism should be focused the most

6375.59 --> 6378.1900000000005
yeah

6378.92 --> 6385.82
can have corporations that industry huh

6381.56 --> 6388.580000000001
yeah well corporations seem to have

6385.82 --> 6393.53
become more and more weaponized against

6388.58 --> 6398.57
humanity structurally so there's

6393.53 --> 6407.08
something to say for that but not not

6398.57 --> 6409.91
permanently yeah that's how it is

6407.08 --> 6414.17
now I I don't like it when people don't

6409.91 --> 6416.47
start to suggest aku-aku move virus

6414.17 --> 6419.57
right I don't like it when people just

6416.47 --> 6424.490000000001
point at something that involves me and

6419.57 --> 6426.83
then just say it's not [ __ ] funny you

6424.49 --> 6428.3
got it and next time you're banned if

6426.83 --> 6430.99
you're gonna forward that kind of [ __ ]

6428.3 --> 6430.99
with me okay

6446.88 --> 6453.66
yeah it wasn't meant to be funny also

6450.6 --> 6456.35
you were just meant to be a creepy piece

6453.66 --> 6456.349999999999
of [ __ ] then

6462.86 --> 6470.15
I don't know is is your psychopathy

6466.45 --> 6476.08
floating maybe you should put that back

6470.15 --> 6479.08
in the in the box it's really just

6476.08 --> 6479.08
disturbing

6488.36 --> 6494.808999999999
I don't have a backyard and that's not

6493.01 --> 6497.179
what you said you weren't like oh cool

6494.809 --> 6501.55
shooting a bow shooting a bow is fun no

6497.179 --> 6502.7300000000005
you were talking about impaling and

6501.55 --> 6505.639
disgusting

6502.73 --> 6507.799999999999
you were being disgusting don't try to

6505.639 --> 6510.52
crawl back and pretend like that didn't

6507.8 --> 6510.52
happen okay

6519.08 --> 6526.7
what can be achieved on this fun why

6525.53 --> 6532.55
would I do that

6526.7 --> 6537.98
I don't know how old the earth is Evans

6532.55 --> 6543.89
I don't know when linear time started to

6537.98 --> 6546.709999999999
engage I have no idea as far as I know

6543.89 --> 6549.22
time is as old as when my consciousness

6546.71 --> 6549.22
right

6587.78 --> 6590.92
just kidding

6595.07 --> 6601.389999999999
now it's very hard to resist somebody

6598.79 --> 6601.39
says that

6610.25 --> 6619.76
no more in Evans I said for as far as I

6614.09 --> 6626.95
can empirically be certain that's the

6619.76 --> 6629.72
only I don't know are there any more

6626.95 --> 6633.98
unanswerable questions you have Warren

6629.72 --> 6636.9800000000005
Evans are you just asking unanswerable

6633.98 --> 6641.139999999999
questions expecting somebody to just

6636.98 --> 6646.36
give you an answer just a blank answer

6641.14 --> 6649.910000000001
just like your globe priesthood would do

6646.36 --> 6653.98
that what you're expecting is it just

6649.91 --> 6657.349999999999
that you just can't handle not knowing

6653.98 --> 6660.3099999999995
is that that not knowing is it so

6657.35 --> 6660.31
painful to you

6665.48 --> 6673.94
yeah well similarities you know maybe

6671.39 --> 6676.37
men have nipples because some women find

6673.94 --> 6679.94
him attractive ever thought about that

6676.37 --> 6682.13
or maybe because Eve was built literally

6679.94 --> 6684.62
out of a piece of Adam so you could say

6682.13 --> 6690.11
yeah they're pretty synchronous so they

6684.62 --> 6695.5
have like ins likeliness that got any

6690.11 --> 6695.5
more ridiculous questions

6702.39 --> 6708.570000000001
yeah you seem to be full of ridiculous

6706.09 --> 6708.57
questions

6721.68 --> 6729.2390000000005
[Music]

6734.86 --> 6740.058999999999
all right well cult of Lottie I didn't

6737.689 --> 6742.789000000001
tell you to stop and it didn't destroy

6740.059 --> 6746.59
you you just said something stupid so I

6742.789 --> 6750.079
banned and and banned you so keep your

6746.59 --> 6752.979
certificate rules to yourself please you

6750.079 --> 6752.978999999999
know it's a mistake

6766.189 --> 6775.729
yeah why would you bring that up tank

6772.28 --> 6775.728999999999
this is wrong

6793.929 --> 6802.409
okay interesting we good to have some

6799.84 --> 6806.02
actual source on that but whatever

6802.409 --> 6808.57
Warren Evans whatever does it really

6806.02 --> 6813.31
matter does it really matter that there

6808.57 --> 6815.38
are giant giant enormous pieces missing

6813.31 --> 6818.31
within the Bible of what actually all

6815.38 --> 6822.1900000000005
happened that that's blatantly obvious

6818.31 --> 6825.64
does that matter as to the legitimacy of

6822.19 --> 6828.73
it all or is it just you being more

6825.64 --> 6832.4490000000005
nitpicky because you can't handle that

6828.73 --> 6834.79
somebody else may have some kind of

6832.449 --> 6837.159
sensibility to them that they trust and

6834.79 --> 6838.75
you're just completely broken off from

6837.159 --> 6842.04
everything so everything is all the same

6838.75 --> 6842.04
to you is that it

6849.559 --> 6857.179
damn there's a lot there's a lot that

6852.65 --> 6859.48
happen a lot of things happen when time

6857.179 --> 6859.4800000000005
passes

6878.54 --> 6882.41
that was hilarious by the way I thought

6880.19 --> 6901.5199999999995
he was talking about Anamika not that

6882.41 --> 6903.5599999999995
much not that Adam yeah no modern

6901.52 --> 6909.790000000001
caveman it's not a collection of fairy

6903.56 --> 6914.21
tales it is one of the most the vastest

6909.79 --> 6917.34
historical pieces that we have

6914.21 --> 6917.34
[Music]

6924.76 --> 6927.76
interesting

6929.28 --> 6935.13
that's really mm-hmm I never thought

6932.73 --> 6939.469999999999
about that that horse males don't have

6935.13 --> 6939.47
nipple that's interesting I don't know

6941.78 --> 6947.04
but yeah I'm pretty sure that the

6944.97 --> 6949.47
preponderance of let sorry the

6947.04 --> 6952.34
performance all of life is all based on

6949.47 --> 6960.06
the same building blocks is the design

6952.34 --> 6963.2
so yeah so got any more complaints that

6960.06 --> 6969.120000000001
in your mind just makes it absolutely

6963.2 --> 6972.57
impossible that it might have been

6969.12 --> 6975.99
designed and that things may be exactly

6972.57 --> 6981.12
like they are because they were bound to

6975.99 --> 6984.62
be is that super tough for you it must

6981.12 --> 6988.14
be random there must be senseless

6984.62 --> 6990.33
pointless chaos to it all is that it war

6988.14 --> 6994.71
happens is that what you insist upon

6990.33 --> 6997.23
there must be senseless chaos there must

6994.71 --> 6999.81
be meaninglessness at the bottom of it

6997.23 --> 7006.83
is that what you're looking for Warren

6999.81 --> 7009.410000000001
Adam Evans yeah by the way thank you

7006.83 --> 7012.2
Amanda young for the $5 super chat the

7009.41 --> 7013.76
nation tour two hours are in you will

7012.2 --> 7015.71
get up the grid

7013.76 --> 7019.360000000001
you keep go keep up the great work yeah

7015.71 --> 7019.36
Thank You Amanda young for the support

7028.64 --> 7037.950000000001
mm-hmm yeah funny isn't it the either

7034.31 --> 7041.22
it's so funny that things are written

7037.95 --> 7045.24
about all throughout history and yeah

7041.22 --> 7047.820000000001
and other things are written and then

7045.24 --> 7051.9
there's the Bible and it was written was

7047.82 --> 7054.259999999999
written by EWTN's yeah and then things

7051.9 --> 7059.57
were done with that and an entire empire

7054.26 --> 7064.070000000001
spawned on the 180 degrees secret

7059.57 --> 7067.83
imprisonment of the very concept spawned

7064.07 --> 7071.58
empires as we know it in a way right

7067.83 --> 7074.85
still their remnants linger but does

7071.58 --> 7076.8
that make it all just all my god well

7074.85 --> 7078.9800000000005
because all these things were done that

7076.8 --> 7082.29
must mean that it doesn't mean anything

7078.98 --> 7086.879999999999
makes so much sense that entire empires

7082.29 --> 7089.94
could be spawned a big empires could be

7086.88 --> 7093.51
spawned upon a book because it's just

7089.94 --> 7095.54
nonsense just really it makes so much

7093.51 --> 7095.54
sense

7099.249 --> 7108.969
it must be really tough to fundamentally

7102.51 --> 7111.13
believe that you can't help but look for

7108.969 --> 7117.01
that you're looking for the abyss for

7111.13 --> 7121.63
pointlessness senselessness chaos behind

7117.01 --> 7125.71
it all it must be without purpose it's

7121.63 --> 7129.099
so sad when you do that that you're

7125.71 --> 7131.949
compelled by that neurotic impulse to

7129.099 --> 7134.079
seek out pointless senseless chaos

7131.949 --> 7137.888999999999
beneath it all because it must be there

7134.079 --> 7140.71
it cannot have manifested as a giant

7137.889 --> 7143.499
framework through our time with a design

7140.71 --> 7146.949
and a purpose it cannot be it must be

7143.499 --> 7148.51
senseless pointless chaos the abyss

7146.949 --> 7150.28
that's what you're looking for you don't

7148.51 --> 7156.280000000001
even know it you're looking for the

7150.28 --> 7158.7699999999995
abyss buddy why why do you persist the

7156.28 --> 7165.478999999999
senselessness

7158.77 --> 7165.479
[Music]

7170.92 --> 7173.92
yeah

7176.04 --> 7179.109
[Music]

7191.18 --> 7197.1900000000005
expansion not an explosion fantasy

7194.52 --> 7199.400000000001
expansion yeah it is a fantasy expansion

7197.19 --> 7202.41
it is an expansion into the

7199.4 --> 7204.0599999999995
non-existence surreal or things don't

7202.41 --> 7206.67
make any more sense anymore but it's

7204.06 --> 7210.6
really nice to dream about it it's

7206.67 --> 7214.2300000000005
really nice it's not real though more

7210.6 --> 7217.9400000000005
escape more escaping off letting it

7214.23 --> 7220.62
penetrate through you that it's all real

7217.94 --> 7224.19
that it does have a purpose that there

7220.62 --> 7228.59
is a design the things are as they meant

7224.19 --> 7231.36
to be and that your delusions of nothing

7228.59 --> 7235.08
literally the nothing that you look for

7231.36 --> 7238.11
cannot be found in reality the only

7235.08 --> 7243.2699999999995
place you can find it is if you step

7238.11 --> 7245.549999999999
away and tumble into the abyss because

7243.27 --> 7248.46
only if reality itself steps out of the

7245.55 --> 7251.76
way for you is when you can find that

7248.46 --> 7253.7390000000005
what you are looking for right here the

7251.76 --> 7258.570000000001
senselessness the pointlessness the

7253.739 --> 7261.449
chaos that the the lack of purpose is

7258.57 --> 7263.429999999999
what you seek reality is not going to

7261.449 --> 7265.949
provide that to you it's going to show

7263.43 --> 7268.110000000001
you the opposite so only if you put

7265.949 --> 7271.889999999999
reality out of the way are you going to

7268.11 --> 7275.21
find what you look for and the globe

7271.89 --> 7275.21
dream is a big part of that

7279.72 --> 7286.54
now our in Evans it doesn't appendix a

7284.65 --> 7289.629999999999
does have a function and yeah it could

7286.54 --> 7291.85
kill you but it's usually when you

7289.63 --> 7293.95
overall mistreat your own body in a

7291.85 --> 7297.31
bizarre way so if you're gonna for

7293.95 --> 7299.8
example eat GMOs or take vaccines and

7297.31 --> 7302.26
[ __ ] yeah certainly this mechanism

7299.8 --> 7306.04
because it actually does something very

7302.26 --> 7308.56
specifically and then suddenly it can

7306.04 --> 7310.87
just like ah lose control and yeah that

7308.56 --> 7317.14
could be very dangerous I had it myself

7310.87 --> 7323.92
and that's because of mistreatment it's

7317.14 --> 7330.88
like oh my God why let's try to get

7323.92 --> 7336.43
silly about something that's gonna be

7330.88 --> 7339.82
really silly but it's like oh I have

7336.43 --> 7345.13
skin but every time I throw acid on it

7339.82 --> 7348.969999999999
yeah it's just not it's bad so why why

7345.13 --> 7351.31
would I yeah why would I want to accept

7348.97 --> 7353.05
skin has a good purpose anyway it's

7351.31 --> 7356.29
always miss functional yeah I know I

7353.05 --> 7358.42
keep on throwing acid on it but why

7356.29 --> 7361.51
what's the purpose of the skins not

7358.42 --> 7364.42
working well maybe you shouldn't poison

7361.51 --> 7367.6900000000005
yourself and guess what it's probably

7364.42 --> 7369.49
not gonna do the same thing then now

7367.69 --> 7371.5
let's not throw acid on it's just a

7369.49 --> 7374.98
terrible example but just to show you

7371.5 --> 7377.25
that it's like oh it's miss functional

7374.98 --> 7382.419999999999
well maybe the miss function is not

7377.25 --> 7384.16
because it was no purpose no purpose no

7382.42 --> 7386.02
maybe it's just because you're freakin

7384.16 --> 7388.87
poisoning yourself and then suddenly it

7386.02 --> 7390.990000000001
goes out of whack happens to the best of

7388.87 --> 7390.99
us

7397.08 --> 7400.08
instead

7401.879 --> 7407.879
see he's gonna keep on going he's gonna

7404.639 --> 7411.51
drag in all of biology because this man

7407.879 --> 7415.519
is literally satanically obsessed with

7411.51 --> 7419.369000000001
the abyss and I'm not even exaggerating

7415.519 --> 7421.559
he really is because he's seen all of it

7419.369 --> 7424.739
he's seen all the data and the only

7421.559 --> 7428.820000000001
thing he was ever looking for the only

7424.739 --> 7431.518999999999
thing was the abyss and he's doing it

7428.82 --> 7434.039
right now and he'll be doing it probably

7431.519 --> 7436.649
till the end of the day his days or

7434.039 --> 7440.599
until he finally wakes up from his

7436.649 --> 7440.599
freakin demonic insanity

7451.349 --> 7459.51
right okay so all of these vestigial

7455.79 --> 7465.909
supposed organs it's all [ __ ]

7459.51 --> 7468.55
based on what on the necromancers that

7465.909 --> 7471.28
like categorized every single part of

7468.55 --> 7473.139
the body and then has huge amount of

7471.28 --> 7474.849
miss assumptions as to what it really

7473.139 --> 7478.81
does even though there has been a lot

7474.849 --> 7481.42
worked out anyway a lot of it is still

7478.81 --> 7483.13
preliminary there's a very little

7481.42 --> 7485.38
understanding really about what the body

7483.13 --> 7490.63
does and the other approaches in

7485.38 --> 7494.679
medicine bypassing and mostly ignoring

7490.63 --> 7496.57
also mainstream medicine allopathic

7494.679 --> 7498.58
medicine and then you find out wait

7496.57 --> 7501.639
there's so many more ways you can

7498.58 --> 7505.42
approach this and guess what these foods

7501.639 --> 7508.869
to do human organs right they're all

7505.42 --> 7512.92
accounted for in the German new medicine

7508.869 --> 7515.409
yeah because they're not [ __ ] retards

7512.92 --> 7516.969
that are gonna suggest there's no

7515.409 --> 7520.089999999999
purpose you should know they actually

7516.969 --> 7522.58
figured it out for real and they're not

7520.09 --> 7524.860000000001
just gonna move it out of the way of

7522.58 --> 7527.11
some kind of [ __ ] evolution

7524.86 --> 7529.179
explanation with new use for this

7527.11 --> 7531.78
there's no use PT's it's [ __ ]

7529.179 --> 7531.78
[ __ ]

7537.82 --> 7541.009999999999
[Music]

7541.28 --> 7556.889999999999
so got any more mister staring abyss man

7548.16 --> 7560.51
Warren Evans oh yeah you got the list

7556.89 --> 7564.0
this man has lists you read it all and

7560.51 --> 7566.070000000001
he thinks he knows it all because the

7564.0 --> 7568.44
only thing that he's accepting is the

7566.07 --> 7571.759999999999
abyss is that there is no purpose

7568.44 --> 7575.25
there's only chaos nothing has meaning

7571.76 --> 7577.47
there is no design that is what he's

7575.25 --> 7583.14
looking for that is how he reflected

7577.47 --> 7586.2300000000005
upon all the data because that's the

7583.14 --> 7588.59
only way you could prevent the actual

7586.23 --> 7591.0
insight from hitting you from actually

7588.59 --> 7593.7
realizing that it is exactly the

7591.0 --> 7597.05
opposite and he couldn't do it because

7593.7 --> 7597.05
he's pathetic

7612.07 --> 7617.83
that's right

7614.48 --> 7623.2699999999995
sinuses definitely have a function and

7617.83 --> 7628.489
so does the appendix so do a lot of

7623.27 --> 7630.620000000001
things in the body so it's like this did

7628.489 --> 7634.459999999999
you know that really in the early early

7630.62 --> 7636.92
early days it's even discussed that this

7634.46 --> 7639.26
spleen was thought to be like

7636.92 --> 7641.15
unnecessary but they couldn't get it

7639.26 --> 7643.16
just like it's there it doesn't do

7641.15 --> 7645.049999999999
anything no but you can remove it

7643.16 --> 7647.92
because blah blah blah that's what they

7645.05 --> 7651.26
thought because they were evolution

7647.92 --> 7653.15
thinking based retards they didn't

7651.26 --> 7655.429
realize that they don't do that anymore

7653.15 --> 7658.3099999999995
now they figured out that there's all

7655.429 --> 7661.91
kinds of weird functions regulatory

7658.31 --> 7666.160000000001
functions even immune triggering things

7661.91 --> 7670.099999999999
it's the body is freakin complex and any

7666.16 --> 7672.92
kind of preliminary assessment that

7670.1 --> 7674.719
there's parts in it there's no reason is

7672.92 --> 7678.25
there's no reason even though everybody

7674.719 --> 7682.79
is that there's no reason it is [ __ ]

7678.25 --> 7686.27
too dumb it's a preliminary scan and

7682.79 --> 7688.719
just being very stupid about it that's

7686.27 --> 7688.719
what that is

7696.71 --> 7699.8
[Music]

7705.98 --> 7713.69
hmmm I think I kill this one yeah he's

7710.65 --> 7715.94
running out there's not surprised

7713.69 --> 7722.629999999999
because I hit it right on the head in

7715.94 --> 7724.73
the most sensitive region and I've I've

7722.63 --> 7727.22
been there dude I've been there I've

7724.73 --> 7730.639999999999
been in an abyss digger as well

7727.22 --> 7733.01
it's fairy gifts you'd like this weird

7730.64 --> 7735.38
sensation of power like there's nothing

7733.01 --> 7737.87
that I control that can control me

7735.38 --> 7741.74
because there is no purpose that I'm

7737.87 --> 7744.17
detached and then you can this false

7741.74 --> 7745.67
sense of power because of the rejection

7744.17 --> 7747.77
it's like a rebellious act but it's

7745.67 --> 7749.93
really a rebellious act against creation

7747.77 --> 7753.740000000001
and God itself you can make that mistake

7749.93 --> 7756.02
but then if you gaze upon everything

7753.74 --> 7758.36
upon all of creation all the meaning and

7756.02 --> 7761.38
then the only thing you do is look for

7758.36 --> 7764.87
the abyss well guess what's gonna happen

7761.38 --> 7770.06
if you don't stop doing that guess what

7764.87 --> 7772.0199999999995
that's gonna lead can you feel it can

7770.06 --> 7775.219
you feel it

7772.02 --> 7775.219
[Music]

7775.4 --> 7784.299999999999
some point I don't know this may be just

7778.34 --> 7784.3
an idea but at some point if you reject

7784.48 --> 7792.7699999999995
the Creator long enough it's not gonna

7789.34 --> 7799.39
you're not gonna be able to anymore you

7792.77 --> 7799.39
you want you yeah it's gonna leave you

7804.89 --> 7810.34
and then the abyss can be the only thing

7807.29 --> 7810.34
left for you to find

7815.23 --> 7821.839999999999
but anyway anybody learns these things

7818.87 --> 7824.0
in their own pace in their own approach

7821.84 --> 7828.02
I've been on the other side as well I've

7824.0 --> 7830.719
been challenged by people in my position

7828.02 --> 7834.469
that I'm now that those people

7830.719 --> 7837.26
confronted me ten years ago from all

7834.469 --> 7839.39
kinds of places even in a church that I

7837.26 --> 7842.6
was kind of like being cheeky

7839.39 --> 7844.52
not very friendly and then I've had all

7842.6 --> 7846.650000000001
these things all these things that I'm

7844.52 --> 7853.160000000001
subjecting some of my audience to some

7846.65 --> 7856.3099999999995
of the more stubborn globe system

7853.16 --> 7858.139999999999
thinkers I've been subjected subjected

7856.31 --> 7860.6
to that myself and it kind of

7858.14 --> 7863.81
embarrassed me back in the time you know

7860.6 --> 7866.150000000001
how ballers kind of go like when you

7863.81 --> 7869.6900000000005
caught them that happened to me except I

7866.15 --> 7872.9
didn't go because as soon as I heard

7869.69 --> 7875.03
some truth I would be shocked because I

7872.9 --> 7878.239
didn't expect that for real I was kind

7875.03 --> 7880.58
of naive in the angle to it but I would

7878.239 --> 7885.29
recognize like oh [ __ ] they got a point

7880.58 --> 7887.66
I might not be capable of proceeding

7885.29 --> 7891.199
from here on from the angle that I had I

7887.66 --> 7894.23
might have to break off I would respect

7891.199 --> 7898.46
the truth if I recognized that even as I

7894.23 --> 7899.62
was going on my my way and doing it in

7898.46 --> 7903.44
my way

7899.62 --> 7905.38
right but these ballers over here don't

7903.44 --> 7909.29
seem to be doing that

7905.38 --> 7911.03
there's just no recognition of the truth

7909.29 --> 7912.7699999999995
when it stares them in the face there's

7911.03 --> 7918.37
the embarrassment and then another

7912.77 --> 7920.9890000000005
rejection it's like why do they

7918.37 --> 7926.51
underestimate how much consequence it

7920.989 --> 7931.58
has to constantly reject the truth when

7926.51 --> 7934.31
it stares you in the face it's not

7931.58 --> 7936.5
something really to be taken lightly and

7934.31 --> 7938.0
people learn this over their lives but

7936.5 --> 7941.12
it seems that there are some people out

7938.0 --> 7947.02
there that just don't and it's very

7941.12 --> 7947.0199999999995
worse worrisome and disturbing to be

7970.97 --> 7976.84
more assumptions ridiculous

7978.29 --> 7983.19
so they'll go on forever you know that's

7981.69 --> 7987.889999999999
the whole thing about that's what they

7983.19 --> 7990.719999999999
always do they look for the abyss and

7987.89 --> 7994.280000000001
they can't really find it but they can

7990.72 --> 7996.81
keep on looking forever forever

7994.28 --> 7999.09
basically their entire lifetime because

7996.81 --> 8002.990000000001
of the preponderance of [ __ ]

7999.09 --> 8004.58
materials and the raw data as well that

8002.99 --> 8008.78
is out there that so they can just keep

8004.58 --> 8012.98
on going getting it wrong all the time

8008.78 --> 8014.57
constantly perpetually because there's

8012.98 --> 8018.259999999999
just so much material that they can't

8014.57 --> 8020.48
just red-herring to just ignore it again

8018.26 --> 8022.96
another failure or laugh about it and

8020.48 --> 8027.08
just move on to another little detail of

8022.96 --> 8030.2300000000005
that giant giant playground of all this

8027.08 --> 8032.63
data but you can approach looking for

8030.23 --> 8034.73
the abyss trying to prove to yourself

8032.63 --> 8038.9800000000005
that there is no design to it that it's

8034.73 --> 8041.69
all pointless it's no purpose only chaos

8038.98 --> 8044.33
you can keep on doing that for a very

8041.69 --> 8048.049999999999
very very very long time because there

8044.33 --> 8050.23
is so much to do that with but it's

8048.05 --> 8055.13
never gonna help you though there is no

8050.23 --> 8057.139999999999
practical use in a sensible earthly way

8055.13 --> 8060.56
to keep on doing that for a very long

8057.14 --> 8063.160000000001
time it's just gonna keep you tied to

8060.56 --> 8063.160000000001
that abyss

8070.42 --> 8075.2
okay I like that

8071.98 --> 8079.69
call talati heroin have you ever thought

8075.2 --> 8079.69
of getting a PhD in everything

8094.51 --> 8103.63
[Music]

8097.46 --> 8103.63
Oh God terrible AGM

8114.659 --> 8120.839999999999
yeah all right you come first thinks

8118.35 --> 8124.71
he's parroting what he sees in reality

8120.84 --> 8126.929
but it's not just repeating some data

8124.71 --> 8130.05
okay that's not what you do what you do

8126.929 --> 8134.96
in the communication as you talk about

8130.05 --> 8138.81
it what drives you not the information

8134.96 --> 8143.34
what drives you and I'm pretty sure that

8138.81 --> 8145.679
you're literally staring at it seeing

8143.34 --> 8148.650000000001
how other people what drives them to

8145.679 --> 8151.38
find their and then you start attacking

8148.65 --> 8153.0599999999995
that because the only thing that you're

8151.38 --> 8155.55
seeing that the thing that you are

8153.06 --> 8158.580000000001
convinced of no no matter the

8155.55 --> 8160.889
consequence is that there is nothing

8158.58 --> 8164.13
there it doesn't mean anything it's

8160.889 --> 8167.13
chaos there is no designed to it it's

8164.13 --> 8169.8
all meaningless really foundationally in

8167.13 --> 8172.29
the end and that is what you do in

8169.8 --> 8174.4800000000005
relation to that while other people do

8172.29 --> 8177.449
actually see the design in it they can

8174.48 --> 8182.178999999999
find meaning in it they can find a wider

8177.449 --> 8186.5
purpose in it all they understand it

8182.179 --> 8186.5
and you don't like that

8198.65 --> 8201.82
[Music]

8207.679 --> 8212.88
come virus why don't you question

8209.969 --> 8217.188999999998
yourself if you question everything

8212.88 --> 8223.969
right so do you ever question yourself

8217.189 --> 8227.130000000001
your course of action are you honestly

8223.969 --> 8229.5
entertaining concepts and let letting

8227.13 --> 8231.899
the energies of them truly be unleashed

8229.5 --> 8234.12
on you not just taking your distance and

8231.899 --> 8237.569
allowing your intellect just [ __ ] around

8234.12 --> 8240.149000000001
with it no really looking at it do you

8237.569 --> 8241.189
allow yourself to do that I don't think

8240.149 --> 8244.92
so

8241.189 --> 8250.29
there's no proof that you've displayed

8244.92 --> 8252.51
of that of that type of action you're

8250.29 --> 8255.09
not entertaining anything that I'm

8252.51 --> 8260.429
saying anything about the principles

8255.09 --> 8263.429
that I'm saying you're just focusing on

8260.429 --> 8270.149
that you must be right there can't be a

8263.429 --> 8273.33
design cannot be and all the

8270.149 --> 8278.269
consequences of it that's really what

8273.33 --> 8278.269
what's happening in right there

8285.84 --> 8291.62
what

8288.51 --> 8291.62
[Music]

8304.78 --> 8310.26
all right so you're an atheist yeah

8311.059 --> 8314.099
[Music]

8321.76 --> 8324.84
it's ridiculous

8327.73 --> 8334.99
so you're literally a rejectionist

8332.01 --> 8338.34
because that's what deism is saying it's

8334.99 --> 8344.59
literally the rejection of it's just

8338.34 --> 8346.78
baseline rejection that's good well

8344.59 --> 8348.81
that's exactly what I described it

8346.78 --> 8351.79
actually you don't believe in anything

8348.81 --> 8357.6
deism doesn't believe in anything it

8351.79 --> 8357.6
doesn't do anything it's only rejection

8359.85 --> 8363.1
[Music]

8364.96 --> 8372.569
I don't see how this is anything other

8367.599 --> 8372.569
than just hardcore atheism really

8384.94 --> 8391.271
right well : dresser it's not even to

8387.79 --> 8393.490000000002
his mind because it's more to his angle

8391.271 --> 8397.271
of approach to what his feelings are

8393.49 --> 8399.84
doing what is he looking for see those

8397.271 --> 8403.54
are things that happen simultaneously

8399.84 --> 8405.7
that is what I'm focusing on today what

8403.54 --> 8411.61
is driving you what are you looking for

8405.7 --> 8415.720000000001
and well what you reveal

8411.61 --> 8417.49
in the information is revealing what you

8415.72 --> 8421.600999999999
are looking for so if you're constantly

8417.49 --> 8425.38
looking for no purpose for chaos for the

8421.601 --> 8427.18
meaninglessness for no design to prove

8425.38 --> 8429.96
that to find that then that is what

8427.18 --> 8429.960000000001
you're looking for

8440.15 --> 8448.039999999999
yeah I looked oh you need me to present

8443.33 --> 8454.4
it I'm not making [ __ ] up buddy it's

8448.04 --> 8460.570000000002
right here deism not to be confused with

8454.4 --> 8466.51
teaism soft opposition that rejects

8460.57 --> 8466.51
revelation sorts of religious knowledge

8473.931 --> 8476.710000000001
all right

8477.45 --> 8484.03
Decimus distinct intellectual movement

8481.08 --> 8487.48
declined towards the end of the 18th

8484.03 --> 8491.86
century industrialization hmm for a

8487.48 --> 8493.96
specific period and eventually

8491.86 --> 8495.341
disappeared some in tenants continued to

8493.96 --> 8502.350999999999
live as part of the intellectual

8495.341 --> 8513.851
movement say Unitarianism is a Christian

8502.351 --> 8522.28
theological movement okay so yeah well

8513.851 --> 8525.28
it's what is this like what else then

8522.28 --> 8530.320000000002
just atheism if you're gonna reject it

8525.28 --> 8536.311000000002
then so that's just yeah pretty action

8530.32 --> 8536.311
sorry I kick does anybody else read this

8542.09 --> 8552.39
yeah but I come Weaver you believe in

8546.87 --> 8554.609
God just not in that God is actually God

8552.39 --> 8555.779999999999
and that he might have crits just like

8554.609 --> 8558.54
what yeah

8555.78 --> 8561.45
what you mean you believe in a unicorn

8558.54 --> 8564.330000000002
that's effectively what that means it if

8561.45 --> 8567.78
you don't understand creation if you

8564.33 --> 8572.85
don't understand what is then God the

8567.78 --> 8575.52
concept of God means nothing doesn't

8572.85 --> 8578.04
mean anything if you take out these

8575.52 --> 8581.37
things don't you get that

8578.04 --> 8582.09
it could be worshiping a unicorn for all

8581.37 --> 8585.87
I care

8582.09 --> 8592.649
doesn't matter we created the universe

8585.87 --> 8597.960000000001
now really so the observe move

8592.649 --> 8600.21
interesting yeah you know there is a

8597.96 --> 8603.089999999998
book that describes this with a lot of

8600.21 --> 8608.22
historical references and feedback and

8603.09 --> 8609.899
[ __ ] doesn't need us well how could

8608.22 --> 8614.63
something that is all things need

8609.899 --> 8614.63
anything it is it

8618.129 --> 8626.629
there is no book for it why not what are

8624.949 --> 8628.609
you saying that there shouldn't be a

8626.629 --> 8631.789
book it should just be a big story that

8628.609 --> 8633.409
people tell from person to person and in

8631.789 --> 8636.919
the hopes it's not just gonna turn into

8633.409 --> 8638.839
some other weird malformed thing where

8636.919 --> 8642.64
it will be turned as an imperial system

8638.839 --> 8646.479
again is that what you do you expect

8642.64 --> 8646.479
what's the problem here

8652.26 --> 8659.369
all right so God is simply to you a

8656.76 --> 8662.749
meaningless construct there's no

8659.369 --> 8666.720000000001
interaction it's just the outside and

8662.749 --> 8670.319
it's basically just a story you tagged

8666.72 --> 8671.819
on and it doesn't mean anything because

8670.319 --> 8675.569
there is no interaction there's no

8671.819 --> 8679.92
there's nothing so I don't know it

8675.569 --> 8685.409
sounds to me like a theism with a a a

8679.92 --> 8688.17
light cherry on top in in the form of

8685.409 --> 8689.85
some kind of idea of God that doesn't

8688.17 --> 8693.17
have any influence it sounds like

8689.85 --> 8693.17
atheism to me buddy

8700.76 --> 8704.300000000001
does it matter

8706.301 --> 8714.841
but if what does it matter if you

8710.591 --> 8719.381000000001
believe in God if if there is no

8714.841 --> 8723.431
interact if there is nothing what what

8719.381 --> 8728.100999999999
is God if there is no contact doesn't

8723.431 --> 8728.101
make you completely don't get it

8732.78 --> 8740.820000000002
you know you could make up whatever you

8738.21 --> 8744.32
know in that sense in that sense it's

8740.82 --> 8748.529999999999
like Pastafarianism is dais in a way

8744.32 --> 8751.08
does it you could make anything it

8748.53 --> 8753.33
that's the whole point about it is that

8751.08 --> 8756.3
you don't do that and you actually take

8753.33 --> 8767.49
into account from a more historical

8756.3 --> 8769.58
understanding do you get get a time out

8767.49 --> 8772.23
buddy

8769.58 --> 8774.78
I'm not saying it is atheism I'm

8772.23 --> 8777.83
literally putting it next to atheism and

8774.78 --> 8781.35
making a case here why don't you defend

8777.83 --> 8783.33
your religious approach that you

8781.35 --> 8786.390000000001
apparently don't really understand all

8783.33 --> 8787.19
that well even though I just learned

8786.39 --> 8789.96
about it

8787.19 --> 8791.67
typical how people can literally follow

8789.96 --> 8795.66
some kind of belief structure for

8791.67 --> 8798.0
potentially decades and not understand

8795.66 --> 8801.66
the freaking basics about what they even

8798.0 --> 8807.08
believe in it's just special it's not

8801.66 --> 8814.61
you know it is oh it's it's pointless

8807.08 --> 8814.61
God ISM it's pointless

8829.18 --> 8834.49
you know it hurt you in his turn we

8832.0 --> 8839.55
don't see godly intervention it's all

8834.49 --> 8839.55
it's not pointless we have a universal

8839.67 --> 8846.3
it's not pointless

8842.05 --> 8850.350999999999
we have a universe we got our entire

8846.3 --> 8853.57
delusions that makes it not pointless oh

8850.351 --> 8858.550000000001
but it what a solid foundation we got

8853.57 --> 8862.51
over there super solid hmm it doesn't

8858.55 --> 8864.699999999999
mean it's it's it's okay there is a

8862.51 --> 8867.94
point to it because there is an outer

8864.7 --> 8873.851
space out there and because of that that

8867.94 --> 8878.4
gives replace the lack of purpose it's

8873.851 --> 8878.400000000001
getting really weird here

8891.86 --> 8899.900000000001
it's it's not pointless it's just it's

8896.6 --> 8901.970000000001
not pointless it's just that there is no

8899.9 --> 8904.699999999999
point to it that's kind of what you're

8901.97 --> 8908.061
saying isn't it there is no point to it

8904.7 --> 8910.69
but we got things to do doesn't have a

8908.061 --> 8918.08
point though hmm what did I say again

8910.69 --> 8920.15
pointlessness meaninglessness I don't

8918.08 --> 8922.49
know how you are about designed but I

8920.15 --> 8924.859999999999
forced so far I don't think you probably

8922.49 --> 8928.07
understand that creation is designed and

8924.86 --> 8930.86
so there's no design to it is that what

8928.07 --> 8935.18
if what I've been saying several times

8930.86 --> 8937.45
now about looking for the abyss sounds

8935.18 --> 8941.41
pretty much like it's accounted for

8937.45 --> 8941.41
sounds like it is abyssal

8950.24 --> 8957.31
all right well I brought your religion

8952.94 --> 8957.310000000001
into this what do you like it or not

8959.74 --> 8963.94
talking about religion right now

8972.58 --> 8979.641
yeah Akuma move ours how about life how

8976.73 --> 8990.350999999999
about every freaking element of life how

8979.641 --> 8993.32
about the spirit hmm think that math is

8990.351 --> 8995.391000000001
the only look is it is it literally

8993.32 --> 8997.67
because that is just the only thing the

8995.391 --> 9003.66
only structure that that is even left

8997.67 --> 9003.66
for you to see it's just math is that it

9005.76 --> 9015.04
that is so plastic literally it's

9010.931 --> 9018.550000000001
plastic it's hollow it's only form don't

9015.04 --> 9021.400000000001
you understand the meaning there is a

9018.55 --> 9024.279999999999
design every aspect of the body is

9021.4 --> 9027.91
designed every aspect from scratch could

9024.28 --> 9030.601
never have evolved could not come out of

9027.91 --> 9035.65
nothing it's all designed Akuma virus

9030.601 --> 9039.130000000001
see you are an atheist what kind of

9035.65 --> 9044.100999999999
[ __ ] would say they would believe in a

9039.13 --> 9048.88
creator and not a design you must be

9044.101 --> 9053.08
absolutely stupendously idiotic at this

9048.88 --> 9055.270999999999
point to think that how can you be that

9053.08 --> 9059.61
stupid how can you think there can be

9055.271 --> 9064.181
creation without design are you insane

9059.61 --> 9066.49
have your math fascinations blind you

9064.181 --> 9069.75
have that has your math burned your

9066.49 --> 9069.75
fairy senses

9076.11 --> 9079.890000000001
can't take this [ __ ] anymore

9085.67 --> 9089.319
[Music]

9098.979 --> 9108.219
no you have to hit okay Akuma virus

9104.979 --> 9112.448999999999
let's see that's fine he doesn't want to

9108.219 --> 9119.708999999999
believe in design but math made him so

9112.449 --> 9121.949
he had no choice it's must be tough very

9119.709 --> 9121.949
tough

9127.04 --> 9132.35
yeah yeah a Kumu virus look I don't know

9130.46 --> 9135.14
what you're trying to do you try to keep

9132.35 --> 9137.33
on digging yourself out but yeah you're

9135.14 --> 9139.67
knee-deep in mud and you don't have

9137.33 --> 9142.28
wooden shoes and you're not getting out

9139.67 --> 9146.38
of this one so I'm gonna run out the

9142.28 --> 9149.800000000001

9173.8 --> 9181.699999999999
back-and-forth sparring you could say me

9177.26 --> 9184.22
yeah getting pretty hot on the on the

9181.7 --> 9186.800000000001
