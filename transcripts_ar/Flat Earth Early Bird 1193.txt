185.04 --> 189.67999999999998
evening as i predicted

187.519 --> 193.12
it seems like not today

189.68 --> 195.92000000000002
also yeah a remarkably wind still and

193.12 --> 198.239
it's really warm outside

204.08 --> 206.48000000000002
out here

211.12 --> 213.84
beautiful

216.319 --> 221.11999999999998
insects flying all over the place

218.72 --> 224.48
cuddles like these little snout beetles

221.12 --> 227.48000000000002
sitting on the window every time

224.48 --> 227.48
ladybugs

227.84 --> 234.879
big wasps coming by bumblebees i haven't

230.879 --> 234.879

235.68 --> 240.56
i did see some like

238.0 --> 242.4
a few months ago when it was colder oh

240.56 --> 244.72
my camera stuck again

242.4 --> 244.72

263.36 --> 265.68
anyway

266.24 --> 270.40000000000003
youtube is acting all kinds of weird

268.08 --> 270.4
today

270.639 --> 274.639
right because

272.24 --> 276.56
on my part here it says

274.639 --> 281.639
the title of yesterday's show even

276.56 --> 281.639
though when i edit it says no no 1193.

282.639 --> 284.56
and

283.68 --> 287.36
yeah

284.56 --> 290.0
it's just acting weird when i refresh it

287.36 --> 293.199
sometimes it says oh it's offline

290.0 --> 295.199
uh no it's not

293.199 --> 298.08000000000004
that's a weird [ __ ]

295.199 --> 299.759
it's not obs at least other than camera

298.08 --> 302.639
freezing and all that

299.759 --> 305.84000000000003
right anyway hello goalie mckerman first

302.639 --> 308.479
in chat elise g matthew hall

11.93 all right

325.68 --> 329.199
i'll show you what i mean though

334.4 --> 341.44
right so see the title there

338.56 --> 343.44
doesn't make any sense but

341.44 --> 345.919
is my camera stuck again

343.44 --> 345.919
again

351.84 --> 354.84

377.44 --> 382.56
good to see you

379.6 --> 382.56
how are you all doing

382.96 --> 386.08
i'm doing pretty good

386.319 --> 392.24
like my jaw is like fully restored so

390.96 --> 394.4
like

392.24 --> 396.24
it yeah it's in such a good condition

394.4 --> 400.4
that it feels like nothing ever happened

396.24 --> 400.40000000000003
there that's the way i like it

400.56 --> 405.039
it's just that when it's really sore and

402.88 --> 407.36
it lasts a while you never really expect

405.039 --> 411.199
or i never really expect it to fully go

407.36 --> 411.199
away i'm kind of a pessimist like that

412.4 --> 417.44
but it did

414.0 --> 417.44
so i had a pretty good sleep

420.16 --> 423.59900000000005
although i did go to bed a bit late

422.16 --> 424.56
because i got

423.599 --> 427.199
kind of

424.56 --> 427.199
excited

428.72 --> 434.08000000000004
the title changed back again

431.199 --> 437.319
just right in front of my eyes

434.08 --> 437.31899999999996
all right

441.44 --> 445.84
the ad

443.599 --> 449.52
received is black now oh really the ads

445.84 --> 451.52
are getting weird huh

449.52 --> 453.599
i didn't see any ads pop up even though

451.52 --> 455.28
they are set

453.599 --> 456.71999999999997
but i guess that

455.28 --> 460.31899999999996
yeah

456.72 --> 460.319
youtube's got things mixed up

461.599 --> 468.639
you don't know how the word freemason

465.68 --> 468.639
got in there what

472.479 --> 479.28
you know them by freemason's heart what

476.16 --> 480.879
that is weird

479.28 --> 482.87899999999996
all right

480.879 --> 484.96000000000004
anyway i got some more gusto energy

482.879 --> 487.44

484.96 --> 490.0
yesterday and i felt like yeah and i'm

487.44 --> 490.0

554.72 --> 561.2
it's a new one and like really really

on a high-end level that i'm

565.279 --> 570.0
like me arwen i'm impressed

568.0 --> 572.08
that was impressive

570.0 --> 575.76

572.08 --> 578.72
he did with his street activism

575.76 --> 578.72
i'll link that up

579.44 --> 583.72
it's definitely worth watching

585.52 --> 588.61
[Applause]

right yeah seek star wars yeah dell is

595.76 --> 599.76
very good doing that

598.8 --> 602.24
and

599.76 --> 604.64
it's kind of funny because he he does

602.24 --> 607.279
have like this natural teacher thing to

604.64 --> 607.279
him in a way

607.6 --> 614.72
specific like he's so good at like

609.92 --> 618.3199999999999
addressing kids of of that age range

614.72 --> 620.1600000000001
it's it's it's fascinating to see

618.32 --> 624.8000000000001
and he's getting better at it i think

620.16 --> 624.8
over time so it's just like yeah mandel

627.68 --> 631.8389999999999
anyway

629.92 --> 633.76
that happened also another video i

631.839 --> 636.8800000000001
noticed this morning

633.76 --> 640.3199999999999
from level earth observer

636.88 --> 643.2
beijing we got a problem

640.32 --> 643.2
really weird

643.68 --> 649.64
like apparently

645.68 --> 649.64
chinese speciation

650.32 --> 653.9200000000001
they have that and they're sort of did

652.72 --> 657.2
something

653.92 --> 660.16
similar to the iss but they warped

657.2 --> 662.1600000000001
the footage of earth like seriously

660.16 --> 664.959
seriously warped it

662.16 --> 666.959
and that's this is not some joke this is

664.959 --> 668.56
actually like officially published and

666.959 --> 671.76
they didn't do anything about it

668.56 --> 674.079
apparently crazy

671.76 --> 675.68
so also check that out here's the link

674.079 --> 677.3599999999999
for that

675.68 --> 679.3599999999999
turtle earth yeah

700.0 --> 703.839
i was on it this time

706.32 --> 711.2
mostly just active in chat and then yeah

708.959 --> 713.5189999999999
rasta had called me

711.2 --> 715.44
and so i kind of like

713.519 --> 717.92
didn't speak up again after that had a

715.44 --> 720.1600000000001
long call with rasta had he had quite a

717.92 --> 722.7199999999999
few things to share

720.16 --> 723.519
still gonna kind of keep to myself but

722.72 --> 725.0400000000001
yeah

723.519 --> 727.279
he

725.04 --> 730.3199999999999
sounds like he's taking like a very

727.279 --> 733.36
serious upturn in his life very serious

730.32 --> 737.36
potentially and

733.36 --> 737.36
like i'm kind of like like whoa

738.8 --> 744.639
dude like rasta is like really

742.399 --> 746.48
going for it

744.639 --> 748.639
so it's fascinating

746.48 --> 750.8000000000001
and yeah that kept me thinking of course

748.639 --> 753.2
but yeah i just have to remember oh oh

750.8 --> 756.0
yeah wait i'm still just arwin doing my

753.2 --> 757.0400000000001
show kind of e-bagging for food and all

756.0 --> 759.44
that

757.04 --> 762.639
so let's just get back to

759.44 --> 762.639
my real world

763.04 --> 767.519
but it did

764.24 --> 769.76
kind of keep me up in the night

767.519 --> 769.76
uh

770.32 --> 774.24
what else owen benjamin

774.72 --> 781.9200000000001
oh he had a freaking hilarious

778.48 --> 781.9200000000001
new mountain bear cartoon

782.8 --> 786.88
so yeah i posted that everywhere on

785.2 --> 791.36
skype

786.88 --> 796.0
it's very very own benjamin

791.36 --> 797.279
so definitely also check this one out

796.0 --> 799.12
it's

797.279 --> 802.959
did i post the right one

799.12 --> 802.9590000000001
it's only one minute 23.

810.88 --> 816.72
and of course his regular stream which

812.959 --> 816.7199999999999
was pretty epic

818.8 --> 822.56
all right also just found out that my

820.8 --> 824.7199999999999
awesome neighbor guy

822.56 --> 828.8
that helped me actually

824.72 --> 831.6800000000001
get back into my house like twice

828.8 --> 834.0
he's moving away

831.68 --> 836.16
but then again apparently he's moving in

834.0 --> 840.16
with his girlfriend or they're both

836.16 --> 840.16
getting a house together so yeah

840.72 --> 843.839
that is a good reason

845.519 --> 848.9590000000001
but it was pretty awesome guy to have

847.519 --> 850.9590000000001
around

848.959 --> 852.7199999999999
so i'm kind of sad about that i hope

850.959 --> 854.8
that anybody else that's going to move

852.72 --> 855.6800000000001
in there instead is going to be just as

854.8 --> 856.959
cool

855.68 --> 860.6389999999999
and not some

856.959 --> 860.6389999999999
whiny complainy pants person

864.24 --> 869.24
hello george sanford

865.92 --> 869.24
robert digital

879.36 --> 886.0790000000001
just like when they brought out it

884.0 --> 890.88
how it what

886.079 --> 893.76
just like when they brought out it is a

890.88 --> 896.079
trap system what

893.76 --> 898.56
that seems like

896.079 --> 900.88
two sentences accidentally fused into

898.56 --> 902.4799999999999
one i don't understand what that

900.88 --> 905.199
yeah

902.48 --> 905.1990000000001
what that means

911.04 --> 913.92
trade pest

914.399 --> 917.68
said

916.32 --> 919.279
tray pest

917.68 --> 923.279
system

919.279 --> 923.279
you mean trapeze or something

925.04 --> 928.079
don't remember i don't know

927.36 --> 930.24
i

928.079 --> 933.519
doesn't directly ring a bell but it

930.24 --> 935.199
might be because you constantly keep

933.519 --> 936.88
re-spelling

935.199 --> 940.68
so i'm a bit confused as to what you're

936.88 --> 940.68
talking about george sanford

943.04 --> 947.36
i don't know any tray pest system never

945.279 --> 950.16
heard that before

947.36 --> 952.9590000000001
but then again it's not like in the last

950.16 --> 955.759
seven years i've literally

952.959 --> 958.079
have been made aware of every single

955.759 --> 961.04
weird little supposed space exploit that

958.079 --> 963.199
has happened i mean i'm i've

961.04 --> 965.4399999999999
i've been aware of like most of it i

963.199 --> 967.199
guess or half of it i don't know even

965.44 --> 969.0400000000001
how much is out there a lot is out there

967.199 --> 972.399
i'm not aware of it all and i definitely

969.04 --> 972.399
don't remember all the names

973.519 --> 977.759
the new solar system

976.16 --> 980.7199999999999
what

977.759 --> 983.6800000000001
oh so it's just some astronomical naming

980.72 --> 985.6800000000001
of something supposedly very far away

983.68 --> 987.279
that

985.68 --> 990.959
i don't know what you're talking about

987.279 --> 990.959
anyway hello terret 306

1113.44 --> 1117.28
after saying just hello

1115.679 --> 1118.72
within like

1117.28 --> 1122.08
two minutes

1118.72 --> 1123.44
i saw my name come by like at least 20

1131.6 --> 1135.76
really triggered by me

1133.919 --> 1137.3600000000001
and they just were like keep on

1135.76 --> 1139.919
squirting and squirting it's great i was

1137.36 --> 1142.08
just like hi hello fans i know you love

1139.919 --> 1144.3200000000002

1142.08 --> 1144.32
everywhere

1144.48 --> 1151.24
he said this she said that awesome

1146.96 --> 1151.24
like holy [ __ ] dude

1151.36 --> 1157.1999999999998
man

1153.2 --> 1157.2
it was freaking hilarious though

1158.72 --> 1163.76
so yeah just check out that chat from

1161.12 --> 1167.12
the tune stream yesterday with pj on it

1163.76 --> 1167.12
it's just like what the [ __ ]

1168.32 --> 1173.2
magoon goons

1169.84 --> 1174.72
well they're not necessarily off my tune

1173.2 --> 1176.4
but they are just like these are the

1174.72 --> 1179.28
same guys that like

1176.4 --> 1181.1200000000001
hang around in jose's and at ranti's

1179.28 --> 1182.72
when he was still doing his

1181.12 --> 1183.76
global stream

1182.72 --> 1186.72
right

1183.76 --> 1186.72
just like damn

1186.799 --> 1192.9189999999999
derp alert yeah there's a major derp

1189.919 --> 1192.919
alert

1194.08 --> 1197.9189999999999
but it's kind of funny too because

1196.48 --> 1200.96
mctoon

1197.919 --> 1203.2
it did seem like he was

1200.96 --> 1206.32
sort of trying to

1203.2 --> 1208.64
mimic my policy about just social going

1206.32 --> 1208.6399999999999
about

1208.799 --> 1213.679
with a lot of flex flexibility towards

1211.36 --> 1216.08
ballers no surprise

1213.679 --> 1218.159
but at some point i got timed out

1216.08 --> 1220.48
because these freaks in the chat they

1218.159 --> 1221.7600000000002
were basically trying to lay a trap for

1220.48 --> 1223.76
me

1221.76 --> 1225.6
they were they were literally trying to

1223.76 --> 1228.1589999999999
turn me into rage win so that i would

1225.6 --> 1231.36
say something extreme to them

1228.159 --> 1235.2
but all i did is just like

1231.36 --> 1237.52
not actually say that but reference what

1235.2 --> 1239.44
they were saying and then say like yeah

1237.52 --> 1241.039
yeah that no no don't worry it just

1239.44 --> 1242.88
applies to you

1241.039 --> 1244.64
and they got all like oh my god he's

1242.88 --> 1246.5590000000002
threatening me

1244.64 --> 1248.0800000000002
yeah you freaking brought it up you

1246.559 --> 1249.9189999999999
weirdo

1248.08 --> 1251.52
and then time me out but yeah mctoon

1249.919 --> 1253.2
didn't

1251.52 --> 1255.36
didn't see anything wrong with them so

1253.2 --> 1257.679
they got a bit of a slap on the fingers

1255.36 --> 1258.6399999999999
hilarious

1257.679 --> 1261.039
it was

1258.64 --> 1263.5200000000002
very amusing in a

1261.039 --> 1268.0
kind of weird

1263.52 --> 1268.0
yeah school playground kind of way

1273.12 --> 1277.4799999999998
live stream offline what

1282.32 --> 1289.2
okay terra 306

1285.6 --> 1291.4399999999998
yeah youtube's been acting a bit weird

1289.2 --> 1293.2
but yeah i'm not having trouble on my

1291.44 --> 1297.919
side anymore although it still keeps

1293.2 --> 1300.48
saying oh this is episode 1192.

1297.919 --> 1302.8400000000001
uh whatever

1300.48 --> 1306.559
there's nothing i can do about

1302.84 --> 1306.559
it hey bex

1312.0 --> 1319.0
and you get a wrench

1314.96 --> 1319.0
and you get a wrench

1326.0 --> 1330.799
must be nice to be a face in world view

1329.2 --> 1333.6000000000001
community

1330.799 --> 1336.799
well

1333.6 --> 1337.6789999999999
am i if yeah i guess why i'm okay with

1336.799 --> 1340.08
that

1337.679 --> 1340.0800000000002
i mean

1342.559 --> 1347.52
i don't think i'll ever be as effective

1344.96 --> 1350.72
as people like mark sergeant who's

1347.52 --> 1353.84
really like made for that [ __ ]

1350.72 --> 1356.48
and i am over the place i'm not exactly

1353.84 --> 1359.12
like media trained media adapted like

1356.48 --> 1360.48
that i am all over the place emotionally

1359.12 --> 1363.039
and

1360.48 --> 1366.48
and with like freaky pauses at times it

1363.039 --> 1369.44
just was super raw that's not

1366.48 --> 1372.08
effective really as a face but i can

1369.44 --> 1374.64
because i have the knowledge i and i am

1372.08 --> 1377.6
very good at making a stand

1374.64 --> 1377.6000000000001
for arguments

1378.4 --> 1384.64
but it's just that

1381.12 --> 1386.9599999999998
apparently i get to people a lot they

1384.64 --> 1389.039
were those troll freaks

1386.96 --> 1390.96
in that in my tunes chat they were

1389.039 --> 1393.6
literally just

1390.96 --> 1396.32
rolling out like their own summarized

1393.6 --> 1398.3999999999999
history of what i've been doing

1396.32 --> 1401.28
so it's like dude

1398.4 --> 1404.159
i'm so happy that you all watch my show

1401.28 --> 1406.3999999999999
all the time in order to know that

1404.159 --> 1408.0
that that happened to me those days ago

1406.4 --> 1409.679
right it's just like

1408.0 --> 1412.48
hello

1409.679 --> 1414.0
like you're literally proving to me

1412.48 --> 1416.4
through your squirting in somebody

1414.0 --> 1417.76
else's chat that you actually watch my

1416.4 --> 1420.48
shows

1417.76 --> 1423.279
all the time and you supposedly hate it

1420.48 --> 1425.44
but you keep watching though

1423.279 --> 1428.32
so yeah that's

1425.44 --> 1429.44
why i say apparently i have a lot of

1428.32 --> 1431.84
fans

1429.44 --> 1434.72
that are like really fanatical fans and

1431.84 --> 1436.0
they have to like scream my name

1434.72 --> 1438.08
loudly

1436.0 --> 1441.08
to try and get my attention somehow in

1438.08 --> 1441.08
chats

1445.52 --> 1451.48
ah yeah steamy traveler yeah there's

1447.679 --> 1451.48
some issues with youtube

1451.58 --> 1454.79
[Applause]

1463.76 --> 1466.799
hey tim osmond

1466.88 --> 1472.7990000000002
uh

1468.48 --> 1474.96
best show on the net oh wow really

1472.799 --> 1476.24
you're probably being sarcastic right

1474.96 --> 1478.48
but

1476.24 --> 1479.84
yeah

1478.48 --> 1482.88
not them

1479.84 --> 1482.8799999999999
am i the best show

1485.6 --> 1489.76
maybe

1487.52 --> 1493.039
i mean i'm not i'm probably not the most

1489.76 --> 1495.44
entertaining show in the world

1493.039 --> 1497.039
but i i am

1495.44 --> 1501.24
resourceful

1497.039 --> 1501.24
in my own unique way

1505.44 --> 1509.3200000000002
hello reserved lick

1527.58 --> 1530.6999999999998
[Applause]

1552.159 --> 1556.7990000000002
right i hope this is not like all around

1554.88 --> 1558.64
this might be the new disruption

1556.799 --> 1560.24
algorithm though that's being unleashed

1558.64 --> 1561.919
on flat earthers because we're too

1560.24 --> 1564.24
effective

1561.919 --> 1566.88
they might simply not be satisfied with

1564.24 --> 1571.2
us being put in a corner

1566.88 --> 1572.48
anymore since all the freaks that hit us

1571.2 --> 1575.039
are so

1572.48 --> 1577.6
simplistic in mind such cattle that they

1575.039 --> 1579.84
just go over my place

1577.6 --> 1582.48
then get all that data and then start

1579.84 --> 1585.4399999999998
yelling it in outrage out there which

1582.48 --> 1588.0
then effectively negates

1585.44 --> 1590.159
the tightening

1588.0 --> 1592.32
right

1590.159 --> 1594.4
the tightening of the reach

1592.32 --> 1596.32
they do it themselves the trolls are

1594.4 --> 1598.799
effectively negating

1596.32 --> 1601.039
the algorithm that tightens flat earther

1598.799 --> 1602.799
on the internet

1601.039 --> 1605.52
so thank you for that

1602.799 --> 1607.44
but maybe yeah the the

1605.52 --> 1609.36
google overlords have come to the

1607.44 --> 1611.2
conclusion that they need to burden us

1609.36 --> 1613.52
some more so that they are now just

1611.2 --> 1615.8400000000001
gonna literally screw

1613.52 --> 1618.08
with the system so that

1615.84 --> 1620.08
you can't really even watch my shows

1618.08 --> 1621.84
live properly

1620.08 --> 1625.36
and that is a big part of my show you

1621.84 --> 1625.36
know live with the chat

1625.6 --> 1631.279
ah hey thank you jd for the super chat

1628.799 --> 1633.679
super chat's working which is good i

1631.279 --> 1635.919
guess it is

1633.679 --> 1638.24
paypal is also still functioning just

1635.919 --> 1638.24
fine

1639.52 --> 1642.24
hey crockett

1648.96 --> 1652.32
chat seems fine just not the video yeah

1651.12 --> 1655.279
but that's

1652.32 --> 1657.76
kind of the point isn't it

1655.279 --> 1661.12
it's me communicating on camera and

1657.76 --> 1663.52
voice to you guys in the chat if yeah

1661.12 --> 1664.7199999999998
if the camera the youtube itself is not

1663.52 --> 1667.039
working

1664.72 --> 1669.2
it's nice to have that chat but

1667.039 --> 1671.76
yeah then there's no proper show

1669.2 --> 1674.72
connection

1671.76 --> 1676.799
hey flattersage

1674.72 --> 1678.72
hey thank you bex for the

1676.799 --> 1680.96
20

1678.72 --> 1684.0
norway coins

1680.96 --> 1686.64
i don't even know what the name is

1684.0 --> 1689.76
norse cronin

1686.64 --> 1689.76
thank you for the super chat

1695.2 --> 1701.919
and hello by the way canada bear

1697.84 --> 1701.9189999999999
youtube cyber bullying oh

1704.399 --> 1708.799
manipulating the algos

1706.88 --> 1711.6000000000001
gaslight well it's not gas lighting can

1708.799 --> 1714.8799999999999
a bear right the gas sliding part is

1711.6 --> 1717.6789999999999
already applying that's the tightening

1714.88 --> 1720.0
of flat earthers on youtube putting them

1717.679 --> 1723.52
kind of in a corner only letting certain

1720.0 --> 1725.6
people that are assessed as oh okay let

1723.52 --> 1727.279
them in there

1725.6 --> 1728.7199999999998
but that's tight

1727.279 --> 1730.32
right we don't generally get

1728.72 --> 1732.3990000000001
recommendations

1730.32 --> 1734.48
we don't

1732.399 --> 1737.12
they don't allow us to get momentum in

1734.48 --> 1739.44
it we they don't allow us to get a hype

1737.12 --> 1741.76
so that we certainly get piles of people

1739.44 --> 1744.3990000000001
piled on they that's already happening

1741.76 --> 1748.559
it's been happening for years

1744.399 --> 1750.559
quite quite some time pretty much 2016

1748.559 --> 1752.48
is when that started

1750.559 --> 1754.8799999999999
you do realize that right

1752.48 --> 1757.1200000000001
so that's gas lighting that makes us

1754.88 --> 1758.3200000000002
look small right that's a form of gas

1757.12 --> 1760.0
lighting

1758.32 --> 1762.72
but

1760.0 --> 1764.32
yeah disrupting the show that's not gas

1762.72 --> 1767.32
lighting that's just

1764.32 --> 1767.32
disruption

1770.72 --> 1774.24
it's more like sabotage

1776.08 --> 1780.399
but i don't know if that is it could be

1777.919 --> 1783.8400000000001
that all live streams over the youtube

1780.399 --> 1785.76
have this kind of issue right now

1783.84 --> 1787.6
i don't know

1785.76 --> 1789.76
just wait and see could be that this is

1787.6 --> 1791.36
very temporary flaw

1789.76 --> 1793.279
thing and that they'll have this ironed

1791.36 --> 1795.4399999999998
out in like an hour

1793.279 --> 1798.32
we don't know yet

1795.44 --> 1800.72
paypal next time haha that would be

1798.32 --> 1800.72
great

1801.44 --> 1805.3990000000001
could sure use that

1813.52 --> 1818.2
paypal seems to be working just fine

1834.84 --> 1839.4399999999998
uh so did anybody catch like the mctoon

1838.48 --> 1842.96
thing

1839.44 --> 1842.96
with the pj

1843.039 --> 1848.399
it was at kind of a late hour i didn't

1846.159 --> 1851.8400000000001
keep watching to the end though i just

1848.399 --> 1851.84
hung around for like an hour

1851.919 --> 1858.0
at least paypal doesn't take 30 correct

1855.679 --> 1860.159
it does take a percentage out of it

1858.0 --> 1862.559
though

1860.159 --> 1864.3990000000001
i think it's like two and a half percent

1862.559 --> 1866.799
or something i don't know it might have

1864.399 --> 1869.039
been changed

1866.799 --> 1872.519
but yeah 30 is

1869.039 --> 1872.519
a lot more

1883.36 --> 1886.7199999999998
ah steamy traveler you got me back good

1885.76 --> 1887.919
to see

1886.72 --> 1890.24

i don't blame you cana bear

1901.84 --> 1904.8799999999999
i don't watch him too i just thought

1904.0 --> 1907.6
that

1904.88 --> 1910.72
i kind of wanted to see what pichai was

1907.6 --> 1913.279
his condition was and to be fair he kind

1910.72 --> 1913.279
of looked good

1913.44 --> 1918.64
i mean for his doing he looked like

1916.559 --> 1921.76
he doesn't look like he's in bad shape

1918.64 --> 1923.679
or anything so

1921.76 --> 1925.36
yeah that's a relief

1923.679 --> 1927.279
because i draw the conclusion that at

1925.36 --> 1930.08
least he didn't like

1927.279 --> 1932.48
secretly take a vax or something crappy

1930.08 --> 1936.559
like that for some crazy reason i don't

1932.48 --> 1940.08
know you in my book pj is kind of like

1936.559 --> 1940.08
unpredictable in ways

1941.279 --> 1948.039
but he looked fine so it's it's just

1943.6 --> 1948.039
good to see that he's still doing good

1950.32 --> 1955.12
i mean i don't really have ill will

1952.399 --> 1955.12
towards him

1956.72 --> 1961.32
even though he can be a weirdo

1962.0 --> 1969.799
hey rick back

1964.799 --> 1969.799
just woke up yeah better late than never

1981.679 --> 1988.0800000000002
uh goldie mckern is that true

1985.76 --> 1988.08
okay

1988.799 --> 1993.679
i i personally don't know by the way

1990.88 --> 1996.0800000000002
because i have never sent anybody money

1993.679 --> 1997.279
through paypal

1996.08 --> 1998.72
like

1997.279 --> 2001.279
really

1998.72 --> 2004.279
so i i don't even know how that exactly

2001.279 --> 2004.279
works

2006.799 --> 2011.44
but i do get to see like sort of the

2009.279 --> 2014.399
billing if people send me money then you

2011.44 --> 2016.799
get to see like the original amount and

2014.399 --> 2020.4799999999998
then what i eventu what i effectively

2016.799 --> 2022.6399999999999
receive and it is slightly less

2020.48 --> 2026.32
so that's what i get to see every time

2022.64 --> 2026.3200000000002
and it's been like that from the start

2028.799 --> 2031.799
anyway

2033.519 --> 2038.159
pete is in gems a lot oh really god

2039.84 --> 2044.24
why

2042.159 --> 2049.12
so he's really just hanging out with

2044.24 --> 2049.12
those freaking baller weirdos man

2049.52 --> 2053.679
i'm surprised he's still looking as good

2051.44 --> 2055.52
as he does then

2053.679 --> 2057.119
i mean that would suck the life right

2055.52 --> 2058.56
out of me if i kept hanging around in

2057.119 --> 2061.56
that place

2058.56 --> 2061.56
damn

2063.76 --> 2069.48
friends and family no charge of okay

2066.48 --> 2069.48
okay

2076.0 --> 2079.0
huh

2101.44 --> 2104.64
right

2102.4 --> 2108.2400000000002
no you're right

2104.64 --> 2109.359
i think i i messed it up

2108.24 --> 2111.5989999999997
yeah you

2109.359 --> 2114.16
you don't pay a fee

2111.599 --> 2114.1600000000003
it's the

2115.04 --> 2120.079
the recalculated cost from like dollars

2117.52 --> 2121.839
to euros and all that that's what i had

2120.079 --> 2124.5600000000004
in mind it's not they don't take a fee

2121.839 --> 2128.119
out of it you're right

2124.56 --> 2128.119
sorry about that

2135.28 --> 2141.4
anyway

2137.359 --> 2141.4
man i got a full chat today

2144.56 --> 2150.88
is youtube back to normal again

2147.68 --> 2150.8799999999997
for most of you at least

2153.599 --> 2158.0
brian stavely was talking trash about

2155.599 --> 2158.0
fed

2161.04 --> 2166.16
yeah brian steve lino

2163.68 --> 2169.2
the mandela guy

2166.16 --> 2171.2
yeah he's bit of a savage

2169.2 --> 2175.4399999999996
and he he's

2171.2 --> 2175.4399999999996
he'll attack anybody that doesn't just

2175.839 --> 2180.48
embrace all of it

2178.8 --> 2183.119
hello mark

2180.48 --> 2183.119
triangle

2183.599 --> 2187.32
welcome to my chat

2194.72 --> 2199.2
paying for goodness service then

2196.48 --> 2202.079
recipients pays a fee huh

2199.2 --> 2204.56
all right right

2202.079 --> 2206.5600000000004
right that's like if you use paypal as

2204.56 --> 2208.7999999999997
sort of a banking system for your

2206.56 --> 2210.32
company right mark or

2208.8 --> 2213.32
goldie macron

2210.32 --> 2213.32
yeah

2217.68 --> 2222.24
if you basically have like paypal

2219.839 --> 2224.16
options installed on the net so people

2222.24 --> 2226.56
can just like

2224.16 --> 2229.839
click that and

2226.56 --> 2229.839
right anyway

2230.88 --> 2234.88
brian the mandela guy yeah brian stapley

2233.119 --> 2237.839
like even

2234.88 --> 2239.6800000000003
owen benjamin's talking about him

2237.839 --> 2240.839
which you think is

2239.68 --> 2245.359
well

2240.839 --> 2245.359
yeah not complaining here

2245.52 --> 2252.0
but brian basically

2248.88 --> 2254.4
gets savonia and anybody that's like

2252.0 --> 2256.88
yeah but maybe mandela effect's not

2254.4 --> 2257.839
actually the changing of reality

2256.88 --> 2260.48
this is

2257.839 --> 2262.96
because it isn't it isn't at all

2260.48 --> 2265.839
the only changing of reality is the one

2262.96 --> 2265.839
inside of your head

2265.92 --> 2269.6800000000003
and it is an effect

2268.64 --> 2272.3199999999997
it does

2269.68 --> 2274.3999999999996
actually happen

2272.32 --> 2278.32
but it's not what you think it is it's

2274.4 --> 2280.48
the exchanging of your memories

2278.32 --> 2282.8
because and here is the very

2280.48 --> 2284.72
foundational effect of what causes the

2282.8 --> 2288.7200000000003
mandela effect

2284.72 --> 2289.68
if when first confronted with something

2288.72 --> 2291.2
like

2289.68 --> 2292.16
music

2291.2 --> 2295.52
or

2292.16 --> 2297.52
a stage play or a piece of text

2295.52 --> 2300.88
and there's something like

2297.52 --> 2303.44
slightly off about it like out of place

2300.88 --> 2305.359
like there's a distortion in the overall

2303.44 --> 2306.88
aesthetics of the complete picture of

2305.359 --> 2307.839
what's presented

2306.88 --> 2309.92
right

2307.839 --> 2312.72
there's something like slightly off it's

2309.92 --> 2313.599
like uh no i would have said it like

2312.72 --> 2315.7599999999998
this

2313.599 --> 2319.04
right if you have that natural response

2315.76 --> 2322.0
to something when it's first presented

2319.04 --> 2324.56
guess what happens yeah

2322.0 --> 2326.96
it's on average very likely that a

2324.56 --> 2327.839
person that has that natural response to

2326.96 --> 2331.04
something

2327.839 --> 2334.0
an aesthetic detail in yeah in a media

2331.04 --> 2336.8
product advertisement anything right

2334.0 --> 2341.28
that they'll remember

2336.8 --> 2342.2400000000002
it the way they wanted it to be

2341.28 --> 2345.0400000000004
yeah

2342.24 --> 2347.4399999999996
memory does that to you sometimes you

2345.04 --> 2350.4
remember the better thing

2347.44 --> 2352.0
instead of the the raw

2350.4 --> 2354.7200000000003
representation

2352.0 --> 2356.8
it's almost an effect similar to what

2354.72 --> 2359.1189999999997
happens in relationships when you're in

2356.8 --> 2359.119
love

2359.68 --> 2363.5989999999997
you just don't remember the ugly parts

2362.4 --> 2365.92
while

2363.599 --> 2368.079
while you're in it right and then oh

2365.92 --> 2371.28
it's over and then oh suddenly you get

2368.079 --> 2374.1600000000003
to see all the ugly right it's kind of

2371.28 --> 2375.6800000000003
similar to that it really is that's the

2374.16 --> 2377.5989999999997
mandela effect

2375.68 --> 2379.7599999999998
you remember

2377.599 --> 2383.04
it the way

2379.76 --> 2385.6800000000003
you wanted it to be

2383.04 --> 2388.8
and that is the very core foundation in

2385.68 --> 2390.0789999999997
my research opinion of what the mandela

2388.8 --> 2392.079
effect is

2390.079 --> 2394.079
so there's nothing actually changing in

2392.079 --> 2397.28
reality

2394.079 --> 2400.48
it's the mind that changed

2397.28 --> 2402.6400000000003
what you perceived

2400.48 --> 2404.8
and then you remember it the way you

2402.64 --> 2406.72
wanted it to be at the time and then

2404.8 --> 2408.8
yeah you if you then see it back and

2406.72 --> 2411.839
like wait this is wrong

2408.8 --> 2411.8390000000004
like why

2412.319 --> 2416.72
why why is it like what is it again

2418.48 --> 2422.16
why isn't it berenstein

2421.119 --> 2425.2000000000003
why is it

2422.16 --> 2428.24
the other way right because

2425.2 --> 2430.96
the way you suggest or you think it it

2428.24 --> 2432.56
should be is the way that it would sound

2430.96 --> 2435.76
more aesthetic

2432.56 --> 2436.96
more natural more logical

2435.76 --> 2438.7200000000003
so that's

2436.96 --> 2441.76
what you think it should be it's

2438.72 --> 2443.4399999999996
basically a flashback to that moment

2441.76 --> 2445.92
when you first were confronted with it

2443.44 --> 2448.4
and like ah that's off it should be like

2445.92 --> 2450.7200000000003
this but instead of remembering the

2448.4 --> 2453.2000000000003
context of that

2450.72 --> 2456.48
then with mandela affected people you

2453.2 --> 2458.24
think that reality itself that it

2456.48 --> 2460.4
used to be

2458.24 --> 2463.04
the good way no here's the thing it

2460.4 --> 2465.2000000000003
never was it was always the bad way it

2463.04 --> 2467.04
was always slightly distorted because

2465.2 --> 2469.1189999999997
it's like a trick it's a little

2467.04 --> 2470.64
marketing trick and they've been doing

2469.119 --> 2471.92
that for a while

2470.64 --> 2473.839
sometimes

2471.92 --> 2475.6800000000003
it's very weird

2473.839 --> 2477.44
why that sometimes happens in

2475.68 --> 2479.359
advertisement they just do something

2477.44 --> 2481.04
slightly off

2479.359 --> 2483.119
i think it has to do with attention

2481.04 --> 2486.0
grabbing and they basically want to grab

2483.119 --> 2487.599
people by the savonia complex

2486.0 --> 2489.28
they should be like how dare you how

2487.599 --> 2491.6800000000003
dare you and then

2489.28 --> 2494.3190000000004
yeah you become obsessed with that thing

2491.68 --> 2496.319
and that's what the advertisement wants

2494.319 --> 2498.16
they want you to become obsessed with it

2496.319 --> 2500.48
even if it is over something that's

2498.16 --> 2503.04
wrong about it because then you become

2500.48 --> 2506.079
kind of an unconscious involuntary

2503.04 --> 2507.92
advertisement but for them

2506.079 --> 2509.2000000000003
and that's why i think a lot of that has

2507.92 --> 2510.4
happened

2509.2 --> 2512.8799999999997
although

2510.4 --> 2514.0
yeah with movies it's a bit weirder

2512.88 --> 2517.6800000000003
because

2514.0 --> 2519.2
they're not technically advertisement

2517.68 --> 2520.3999999999996
not like that

2519.2 --> 2524.48
so

2520.4 --> 2527.28
but it's still happening with movies too

2524.48 --> 2530.96
so it's all psychological and i'm

2527.28 --> 2532.48
absolutely certain of that like i could

2530.96 --> 2537.7200000000003
write

2532.48 --> 2537.72
about that if i was procured too

2538.88 --> 2544.56
but it is always psychological it is

2541.68 --> 2547.5989999999997
always based on how

2544.56 --> 2550.7999999999997
you actually want the thing the name

2547.599 --> 2552.96
usually how you want it to be naturally

2550.8 --> 2554.48
and that is synchronized with everybody

2552.96 --> 2556.88
will have that like yeah of course it

2554.48 --> 2559.599
should be like that right

2556.88 --> 2561.44
but it never was it was always the wrong

2559.599 --> 2563.599
way on purpose

2561.44 --> 2566.96
you're mistaking

2563.599 --> 2570.4
it always being wrong on purpose

2566.96 --> 2572.8
for that it was changed to bully us

2570.4 --> 2574.56
reality was changed to bully us to [ __ ]

2572.8 --> 2577.2000000000003
around with us no no

2574.56 --> 2579.04
they changed it from the get-go to [ __ ]

2577.2 --> 2581.68
around with you

2579.04 --> 2585.2799999999997
reality itself didn't change your mind

2581.68 --> 2585.2799999999997
changed the reality for you

2588.72 --> 2591.72
right

2592.4 --> 2596.7200000000003
lion and the lamb paintings that's right

2594.88 --> 2600.079
and songs

2596.72 --> 2602.3999999999996
it's all popular insert

2600.079 --> 2602.4
right

2603.119 --> 2609.76
yeah the lion and the lamb yeah

2607.119 --> 2610.6400000000003
that's not biblical though godzilla it

2609.76 --> 2613.599
isn't

2610.64 --> 2615.359
it's not in the bible it was created

2613.599 --> 2618.48
from people

2615.359 --> 2621.44
that were inspired by the bible

2618.48 --> 2624.4
and they kind of made their own thing

2621.44 --> 2627.76
right just like the trinity is something

2624.4 --> 2631.119
that people made out of the bible

2627.76 --> 2633.5200000000004
their own thing it's not actually there

2631.119 --> 2633.52
you see

2633.599 --> 2639.119
people made it lying in the lamb people

2636.319 --> 2642.56
made that it's not actually in the bible

2639.119 --> 2646.839
it never was people made it

2642.56 --> 2646.839
inspired on the bible

2648.4 --> 2651.599
right songs

2649.92 --> 2655.52
paintings

2651.599 --> 2658.1600000000003
inspired by not actually a literal

2655.52 --> 2658.16
reference

2658.72 --> 2663.0789999999997
right people do that

2664.079 --> 2666.48
anyway

2666.72 --> 2670.64
yeah owen benjamin's talked about

2668.56 --> 2672.4
mandela effect a lot he has a couple of

2670.64 --> 2674.24
really detailed streams and he is

2672.4 --> 2678.0
absolutely

2674.24 --> 2678.0
on the same track with this as i am

2686.4 --> 2692.319
trespasses is now deaths

2689.68 --> 2694.48
right well that's also literal rewriting

2692.319 --> 2696.64
right there has been rewriting of the

2694.48 --> 2698.319
bible there's many freaking bible

2696.64 --> 2701.52
versions guys

2698.319 --> 2705.839
rewriting has been happening

2701.52 --> 2705.839
like no that's not a rare thing

2706.319 --> 2709.52
now

2707.2 --> 2713.72
changing retroactively i don't know

2709.52 --> 2713.72
about that i don't think so

2722.64 --> 2726.64
and hey

2723.76 --> 2730.0
who's to say that the bible

2726.64 --> 2732.48
is completely immune to the mandela

2730.0 --> 2734.16
effect which is a psychological effect

2732.48 --> 2736.2400000000002
right

2734.16 --> 2737.68
well if there are things written down in

2736.24 --> 2738.9599999999996
the bible

2737.68 --> 2741.04
that are like

2738.96 --> 2742.7200000000003
this is

2741.04 --> 2745.44
i get this

2742.72 --> 2747.839
it feels slightly off i don't know why

2745.44 --> 2749.92
it might be because it's like thousands

2747.839 --> 2751.359
of years ago and like the energies were

2749.92 --> 2754.079
different and that would have made

2751.359 --> 2756.7999999999997
perfect sense in reflection to anyone of

2754.079 --> 2759.44
that period right but we live in this

2756.8 --> 2762.48
period so now you're looking at details

2759.44 --> 2765.2000000000003
in the bible and you're like

2762.48 --> 2768.319
it's old i get it but

2765.2 --> 2771.1189999999997
in your mind you might be obliged to

2768.319 --> 2772.24
reconstruct it slightly and get to like

2771.119 --> 2774.079
yeah

2772.24 --> 2775.68
of course it's a lime in the land that

2774.079 --> 2778.1600000000003
would be much more better right that

2775.68 --> 2781.2
would be better you might feel that

2778.16 --> 2783.92
and that's a manel effect

2781.2 --> 2786.0789999999997
and a person might then even like yeah

2783.92 --> 2787.6800000000003
this is how i think it's supposed to be

2786.079 --> 2790.5600000000004
and they make their art and if that's

2787.68 --> 2791.5989999999997
allowed then you already have a mandela

2790.56 --> 2794.7999999999997
effect

2791.599 --> 2796.48
because somebody's alternate vision

2794.8 --> 2798.4
of something

2796.48 --> 2800.319
is echoed

2798.4 --> 2804.079
and then people might see that and be

2800.319 --> 2805.599
like yeah that's correct we agree

2804.079 --> 2808.48
and then they get the mandela effect

2805.599 --> 2808.48
towards the bible

2811.599 --> 2815.119
berenstain yeah yeah

2813.839 --> 2817.839
but

2815.119 --> 2821.04
but this is just isn't it just is it

2817.839 --> 2824.0789999999997
have you ever heard of mandela effect

2821.04 --> 2827.359
when it's the other way around

2824.079 --> 2830.88
yeah do you any of you any person

2827.359 --> 2833.04
watching it every single one of you yeah

2830.88 --> 2836.8
have you ever

2833.04 --> 2838.96
been confronted with a mandela effect

2836.8 --> 2840.96
where you remember it like

2838.96 --> 2843.839
wait

2840.96 --> 2845.2
no no no it's not supposed to be spelled

2843.839 --> 2848.0789999999997
like this

2845.2 --> 2850.5589999999997
it used to be spelt like that and it's

2848.079 --> 2853.28
so stupid i remember that name because

2850.559 --> 2855.92
it was wrong it's so stupid

2853.28 --> 2857.44
now they change it to this which is much

2855.92 --> 2858.559
more logical

2857.44 --> 2861.28
no

2858.559 --> 2864.1600000000003
no you don't nobody has nobody in the

2861.28 --> 2866.6400000000003
world has any example of that

2864.16 --> 2868.24
you only now bump into the mandela

2866.64 --> 2870.72
effect things

2868.24 --> 2873.04
because they're wrong

2870.72 --> 2875.839
wait this is wrong why is it spelled

2873.04 --> 2879.04
like this that makes no sense i remember

2875.839 --> 2883.2
it differently the right way

2879.04 --> 2886.16
yeah it's never the other way around

2883.2 --> 2887.7599999999998
nobody in the world can name a single

2886.16 --> 2889.2799999999997
example

2887.76 --> 2891.2000000000003
where you're looking at something a

2889.28 --> 2892.48
piece of writing a movie is seen

2891.2 --> 2893.68
anything

2892.48 --> 2895.2
a song

2893.68 --> 2896.64
and you're like

2895.2 --> 2899.2
wait

2896.64 --> 2901.359
this is like not how i remember the song

2899.2 --> 2903.9199999999996
this is really awesome it used to be

2901.359 --> 2905.119
different and i thought it was stupid

2903.92 --> 2907.04
no

2905.119 --> 2908.319
it's never like that

2907.04 --> 2911.72
because that's not how the mandela

2908.319 --> 2911.72
effect works

2914.16 --> 2919.68
hey paul steele yeah yeah

2916.4 --> 2919.6800000000003
i know i'm right about this

2921.68 --> 2925.52
mandela effect

2923.28 --> 2928.1600000000003
is an auto correction process of the

2925.52 --> 2930.24
mind an intermittent auto correction

2928.16 --> 2932.48
process

2930.24 --> 2934.5589999999997
it's never the other way around it's

2932.48 --> 2936.64
never a restoration

2934.559 --> 2938.4
process away from your personal

2936.64 --> 2942.16
aesthetics to

2938.4 --> 2944.0
raw reality intake it's never like that

2942.16 --> 2946.5589999999997
it's always the other way around it's

2944.0 --> 2949.28
always like wait this is wrong this is

2946.559 --> 2953.079
not aesthetic

2949.28 --> 2953.079
never the other way around

2972.96 --> 2977.119
peter k and mr lyrics yeah it's all over

2975.599 --> 2980.4
the place

2977.119 --> 2982.96
the mind plays tricks on us all the time

2980.4 --> 2985.04
right just like the eyes

2982.96 --> 2986.64
have intermittent

2985.04 --> 2988.319
processes like

2986.64 --> 2991.2
in between i don't know if i'm using the

2988.319 --> 2992.5589999999997
word intermittent correctly

2991.2 --> 2994.8799999999997
have a

2992.559 --> 2997.6800000000003
intermediate

2994.88 --> 2999.359
element in between the raw

2997.68 --> 3001.2799999999997
things that your eyes

2999.359 --> 3003.52
give out as data

3001.28 --> 3007.119
and then there's that part of the brain

3003.52 --> 3009.68
in between the the main frame brain

3007.119 --> 3010.96
that's like oh we gotta

3009.68 --> 3013.68
give it a

3010.96 --> 3016.7200000000003
spatial context we're going to size up

3013.68 --> 3019.2799999999997
like what is represented how your mind

3016.72 --> 3021.4399999999996
is going to roughly size up what you're

3019.28 --> 3023.52
seeing yeah that's an intermediate

3021.44 --> 3025.44
process i got to keep get that word

3023.52 --> 3029.0
straight not intermittent that's nothing

3025.44 --> 3029.0
to do with intermediate

3031.119 --> 3035.119
well there's that process for the eye

3033.2 --> 3037.5989999999997
that's provable

3035.119 --> 3039.2000000000003
well that's they're also that process

3037.599 --> 3042.079
for like

3039.2 --> 3043.2799999999997
aesthetics for beauty for

3042.079 --> 3044.88
things that

3043.28 --> 3049.28
get closer to

3044.88 --> 3049.28
meaning for your person for your

3049.359 --> 3055.119
for yeah for your ego for your

3051.76 --> 3057.92
consciousness there's an intermediate

3055.119 --> 3057.92
creative

3058.559 --> 3061.3590000000004
how do you call that

3061.92 --> 3066.839
there's like an aesthetics manager

3064.4 --> 3068.559
yeah that is it there's an aesthetics

3066.839 --> 3070.64
manager

3068.559 --> 3073.119
intermediate

3070.64 --> 3075.7599999999998
processor for the mind

3073.119 --> 3077.92
it's not just like about to process the

3075.76 --> 3081.3590000000004
raw data but it's more about the

3077.92 --> 3083.839
creative input and how

3081.359 --> 3087.119
you put it together through archetypes

3083.839 --> 3088.319
to remember it on the long run

3087.119 --> 3090.88
right

3088.319 --> 3093.92
there's a process for that as well and

3090.88 --> 3095.119
that is where the mandela effect is

3093.92 --> 3098.319
caused

3095.119 --> 3100.88
because of that intermediate process

3098.319 --> 3104.48
the aesthetics manager for your

3100.88 --> 3104.48
consciousness and your ego

3105.599 --> 3109.1600000000003
copyright arwen

3118.72 --> 3122.839
right also

3120.72 --> 3125.359
man i've been

3122.839 --> 3127.44
watching never knew i was gonna get that

3125.359 --> 3129.359
far but i've been watching more lost in

3127.44 --> 3131.52
space

3129.359 --> 3134.16
and

3131.52 --> 3137.44
yeah still stands but

3134.16 --> 3139.92
it's weird man i got i got a real split

3137.44 --> 3140.8
opinion about this series

3139.92 --> 3141.599
because

3140.8 --> 3144.319
yeah

3141.599 --> 3146.319
it is really [ __ ] boring at times

3144.319 --> 3148.72
some of the characters are really

3146.319 --> 3150.48
annoying

3148.72 --> 3153.1189999999997
and it's like

3150.48 --> 3156.0
the kid actor i don't like it

3153.119 --> 3157.28
it is like he feels the same amount of

3156.0 --> 3159.839
annoying

3157.28 --> 3162.559
although he's better actor better acting

3159.839 --> 3165.359
but he feels just as annoying as like

3162.559 --> 3167.52
uh anakin in star wars one

3165.359 --> 3169.839
just like ah

3167.52 --> 3172.319
yeah he's a little kid it's just like

3169.839 --> 3175.2799999999997
he's too much of a little kid it's like

3172.319 --> 3177.119
it feels doesn't feel right

3175.28 --> 3179.28
like i wouldn't be like that as a little

3177.119 --> 3182.0
kid i mean i might have been like that

3179.28 --> 3184.0
in the freaking 80s but not like in this

3182.0 --> 3185.44
future setting where you're doused in

3184.0 --> 3187.359
information

3185.44 --> 3189.76
there's no way a kid's gonna act like

3187.359 --> 3190.7999999999997
that so that's just like

3189.76 --> 3193.5200000000004
but

3190.8 --> 3195.2000000000003
eventually i'm now in into season two it

3193.52 --> 3196.4
was real grinding getting through the

3195.2 --> 3199.04
first one

3196.4 --> 3201.52
because there's like really aggravating

3199.04 --> 3203.599
plot twists basically that are like oh

3201.52 --> 3206.319
my god i hate you

3203.599 --> 3209.119
why are you doing everything wrong

3206.319 --> 3210.079
there's no freaking leadership

3209.119 --> 3212.559
here

3210.079 --> 3215.119
except for well the parents they are

3212.559 --> 3216.1600000000003
actually awesome i really like them and

3215.119 --> 3218.1600000000003
that's

3216.16 --> 3220.72
like there are some characters super

3218.16 --> 3222.7999999999997
annoying but others are like really

3220.72 --> 3226.48
growing on me they're like really

3222.8 --> 3226.48
growing on me i'm like damn

3226.96 --> 3232.319
it was kind of messy at the start but

3230.24 --> 3236.24
in the second season everything is much

3232.319 --> 3239.04
more like it feels much more real it's

3236.24 --> 3239.04
more fluid

3240.0 --> 3244.0
and i'm yeah there's two three seasons

3242.16 --> 3245.2
so i'm actually kind of starting to like

3244.0 --> 3247.599
it

3245.2 --> 3250.8799999999997
but it still feels like the freaking

3247.599 --> 3252.559
robot is kind of a macguffin that's

3250.88 --> 3256.2400000000002
very dominant

3252.559 --> 3258.6400000000003
and i think it's super annoying

3256.24 --> 3259.9199999999996
that that it speaks

3258.64 --> 3260.96
at all

3259.92 --> 3262.64
and then has

3260.96 --> 3266.16
danger will robson

3262.64 --> 3268.16
shut the [ __ ] up i hate that it's stupid

3266.16 --> 3270.0789999999997
it's so freaking

3268.16 --> 3272.48
rocky three

3270.079 --> 3274.319
just [ __ ] off

3272.48 --> 3278.319
this is too dumb

3274.319 --> 3279.2799999999997
it br it bumps down all the advanced

3278.319 --> 3283.2
[ __ ]

3279.28 --> 3283.2000000000003
that's also in the movie the why

3283.76 --> 3285.8390000000004
right

3284.559 --> 3287.2000000000003
but

3285.839 --> 3291.68
yeah in season

3287.2 --> 3295.4399999999996
season 2 it's just really like a family

3291.68 --> 3297.68
going out there and trying to colonize

3295.44 --> 3300.2400000000002
getting around surviving

3297.68 --> 3303.52
has a bit of like the martian

3300.24 --> 3305.7599999999998
style situations in there

3303.52 --> 3309.359
and i thought it was really good

3305.76 --> 3309.3590000000004
so far it's like yeah

3310.96 --> 3316.0
you really have to like get sit through

3313.76 --> 3318.7990000000004
that first season where you're often

3316.0 --> 3322.799
gonna be like ah you idiot

3318.799 --> 3325.359
you [ __ ] idiot

3322.799 --> 3327.28
everybody should have seen that

3325.359 --> 3329.52
ah

3327.28 --> 3333.44
but then in the second season they did

3329.52 --> 3336.24
that haven't had those types of moments

3333.44 --> 3338.079
so hopefully they won't bring that [ __ ]

3336.24 --> 3341.2799999999997
back and they'll just like get to the

3338.079 --> 3341.28
real fluid stuff

3341.359 --> 3347.4
and i'm actually gonna potentially enjoy

3343.68 --> 3347.3999999999996
the rest of the series

3348.72 --> 3353.9199999999996
space travel with a [ __ ] robot

3352.72 --> 3355.359
yeah

3353.92 --> 3359.119
yeah

3355.359 --> 3360.96
the whole robot makes no freaking sense

3359.119 --> 3363.52
at all

3360.96 --> 3366.48
like that robot acts

3363.52 --> 3369.92
like how a 80s kid

3366.48 --> 3373.119
would fantasize robots would act

3369.92 --> 3376.96
they all they secretly have emotions oh

3373.119 --> 3379.44
yes yes the robin's secretly has

3376.96 --> 3381.76
loyalty emotions oh

3379.44 --> 3381.76
yeah

3381.8 --> 3387.599
[Music]

3384.48 --> 3391.48
it makes no sense it's a war bots

3387.599 --> 3391.48
why would they do that

3395.119 --> 3400.6400000000003
danger will robert yeah but the original

3397.68 --> 3402.96
danger will robertson that was awesome i

3400.64 --> 3406.0789999999997
like the orig like the original movie

3402.96 --> 3408.2400000000002
robot it's so stupid

3406.079 --> 3410.6400000000003
that thing is so ridiculous it is

3408.24 --> 3413.4399999999996
awesome it's it's old

3410.64 --> 3414.5589999999997
it's supposed to be that right that

3413.44 --> 3415.52
worked

3414.559 --> 3417.6800000000003
like

3415.52 --> 3419.92
80 years ago

3417.68 --> 3421.68
it doesn't work now

3419.92 --> 3423.52
don't do that

3421.68 --> 3427.16
don't do that ever

3423.52 --> 3427.16
it's really stupid

3432.799 --> 3437.44
isn't that because it was supposed to

3434.799 --> 3439.52
have been reprogrammed by kid yeah

3437.44 --> 3441.2000000000003
except in this movie

3439.52 --> 3444.24
that doesn't happen or i mean in this

3441.2 --> 3447.1189999999997
series in the movie remake that happens

3444.24 --> 3451.68
i like the roof movie remake

3447.119 --> 3451.6800000000003
i actually in retrospect really like it

3454.16 --> 3458.48
and maybe in the original i don't know

3455.839 --> 3461.52
in this one they they kind of like the

3458.48 --> 3464.0
robot is more like an alien and nobody

3461.52 --> 3466.88
really knows why it's even there

3464.0 --> 3469.76
seriously it's like it has this mission

3466.88 --> 3473.119
but not and then confused it's just it's

3469.76 --> 3475.599
a mess it's they kind of sandboxed the

3473.119 --> 3479.04
situation and it makes no sense it makes

3475.599 --> 3481.44
absolutely no sense like when you really

3479.04 --> 3483.04
get out of the moment situation in the

3481.44 --> 3485.92
series and start to think about okay

3483.04 --> 3487.7599999999998
like what's actually going on here why

3485.92 --> 3489.92
then you'll find out like

3487.76 --> 3492.0
the freaking game master is just

3489.92 --> 3493.599
improving he literally doesn't know what

3492.0 --> 3495.44
the [ __ ] he's doing

3493.599 --> 3497.599
it makes no sense none of what's

3495.44 --> 3499.28
happening actually makes sense like that

3497.599 --> 3502.2000000000003
it really doesn't

3499.28 --> 3505.28
right but as soon as like

3502.2 --> 3507.52
non-robot related situations

3505.28 --> 3510.0
then it's actually pretty cool

3507.52 --> 3511.44
like that they have this whole part like

3510.0 --> 3512.559
the whole

3511.44 --> 3514.319
couple of

3512.559 --> 3516.96
episodes where they

3514.319 --> 3519.119
basically have to get fuel somehow to

3516.96 --> 3521.68
get off the planet before it starts to

3519.119 --> 3524.0
incinerate

3521.68 --> 3524.0
and

3524.16 --> 3528.24
just like

3526.559 --> 3531.8390000000004
that really worked i thought it was

3528.24 --> 3534.4799999999996
really exciting all of that

3531.839 --> 3536.48
so yeah

3534.48 --> 3538.72
it has some really good parts in there

3536.48 --> 3541.04
the series has really good potential i

3538.72 --> 3543.2799999999997
like the outfits too it's pretty cool

3541.04 --> 3544.799
right and the characters most of the

3543.28 --> 3546.2400000000002
characters in there are like pretty

3544.799 --> 3548.319
awesome

3546.24 --> 3551.04
i really like the robinson family and i

3548.319 --> 3553.119
even like the side characters the others

3551.04 --> 3555.04
it's all pretty cool

3553.119 --> 3557.44
but yeah then

3555.04 --> 3559.04
really stupid things also happen that

3557.44 --> 3561.839
are like really

3559.04 --> 3562.5589999999997
just crash you out of it

3561.839 --> 3565.2
so

3562.559 --> 3567.76
yeah mixed anyway sorry for rambling on

3565.2 --> 3567.7599999999998
about that

3570.839 --> 3576.24
ah still looks better than nasa

3573.839 --> 3577.7599999999998
offerings from the same timepiece

3576.24 --> 3581.52
absolutely

3577.76 --> 3584.48
yes paul steele now the cgi is excellent

3581.52 --> 3588.559
they don't overdo it

3584.48 --> 3588.559
it's a good balanced in the cgi

3592.48 --> 3598.0
except for the robot

3594.88 --> 3602.96
because at times it's just like yeah

3598.0 --> 3602.96
it's a robot it's not gonna be like

3603.2 --> 3608.0
naturally squiggling or like wiggling

3606.799 --> 3611.7599999999998
because only

3608.0 --> 3613.92
animals and people in suits do that it's

3611.76 --> 3616.88
stupid

3613.92 --> 3618.7200000000003
there's mistakes like that but yeah a

3616.88 --> 3621.28
lot about the whole robot thing is kind

3618.72 --> 3621.2799999999997
of stupid

3627.599 --> 3632.88
anyway

3628.4 --> 3635.04
enough about that series lost in space

3632.88 --> 3636.96
uh i'm gonna keep watching it though

3635.04 --> 3638.799
over the weeks

3636.96 --> 3643.319
or the next week at least i don't know

3638.799 --> 3643.319
how quickly i'm gonna go through it all

3652.799 --> 3657.64
where did the queue come from what

3660.0 --> 3664.799
rideable goat robot what the [ __ ]

3668.079 --> 3671.079
what

3677.68 --> 3681.839
danger will robinson am i missing a

3679.839 --> 3683.119
chrome ozone

3681.839 --> 3685.359
okay

3683.119 --> 3685.359
bear

3687.359 --> 3692.799
marvin from hitchhiker

3690.48 --> 3693.92
checkers guide to the galaxy i don't

3692.799 --> 3698.2
remember

3693.92 --> 3698.2000000000003
i've seen that movie like once

3719.28 --> 3725.96
ah man time has flown

3721.839 --> 3725.96
i am having fun though

3728.48 --> 3732.88
but yeah i got

3729.92 --> 3732.88
20 more minutes

3733.92 --> 3738.52
it's not going to be my longest show

3742.88 --> 3747.839
made by kawasaki

3745.359 --> 3747.839
really

3750.799 --> 3754.559
okay i think i'm gonna try to google

3752.88 --> 3756.079
that that sounds

3754.559 --> 3759.079
at least want to see what that looks

3756.079 --> 3759.079
like

3761.31 --> 3766.429
[Applause]

3779.76 --> 3782.76
huh

3783.599 --> 3786.319
wow

3784.559 --> 3787.8390000000004
that looks more like an

3786.319 --> 3789.7599999999998
like a deer

3787.839 --> 3794.16
like that's a big freaking goat or

3789.76 --> 3794.1600000000003
that's a really small japanese person

3794.72 --> 3800.64
anyway yeah bizarre i will

3798.799 --> 3803.839
present that

3800.64 --> 3803.839
i want to show you guys

3807.119 --> 3811.1600000000003
yeah pretty weird right

3837.359 --> 3841.839
okay so

3839.599 --> 3845.119
is that writable goat thing actually

3841.839 --> 3845.119
supposed to be like a

3845.52 --> 3850.16
is it like a unique thing

3847.92 --> 3852.96
that they built just because they could

3850.16 --> 3856.0789999999997
or is that actually supposed to be a

3852.96 --> 3856.079
commercial device

3856.24 --> 3859.9199999999996
is this something they're actually going

3857.839 --> 3863.68
to like put out on the market like

3859.92 --> 3865.28
instead of motorbikes

3863.68 --> 3868.24
because that would be

3865.28 --> 3870.96
really freaky

3868.24 --> 3872.9599999999996
so is it like just a gizmo

3870.96 --> 3874.7200000000003
or is it actually like gonna be

3872.96 --> 3879.48
standardized or something

3874.72 --> 3879.48
it's really freaking weird man

3887.039 --> 3891.2400000000002
thanks for the tip george sanford

3900.4 --> 3905.28
i mean

3901.839 --> 3907.92
technically i think that like a robot

3905.28 --> 3909.599
there it's not a goat it's a deer just

3907.92 --> 3912.48
because of this freaking goat horns

3909.599 --> 3914.96
doesn't yeah it's too big for a goat

3912.48 --> 3918.48
but i mean i guess that if you're like

3914.96 --> 3920.4
in wilder territorial like super frozen

3918.48 --> 3923.359
places

3920.4 --> 3926.2400000000002
it might actually be kind of handy right

3923.359 --> 3928.48
if it's not just snowy surfaces which

3926.24 --> 3930.799
like the

3928.48 --> 3933.359
snowmobiles are very good for that but

3930.799 --> 3936.24
like if it's kind of rocky or uneven

3933.359 --> 3938.5589999999997
then maybe like a robot goat would work

3936.24 --> 3938.5589999999997
great

3938.72 --> 3942.16
right because if you're gonna do that

3940.16 --> 3944.319
with an actual animal yeah they might

3942.16 --> 3946.16
absolutely freeze up

3944.319 --> 3950.4
like frozen hooves or something but

3946.16 --> 3950.3999999999996
maybe a robot gun would work great

3957.119 --> 3961.52
i mean they're already

3958.559 --> 3964.7200000000003
you do realize they even have like these

3961.52 --> 3966.559
walking robots that they use what is it

3964.72 --> 3968.319
in norway

3966.559 --> 3970.2400000000002
i think in norway could be another

3968.319 --> 3971.839
scandinavian country where they use it

3970.24 --> 3975.1189999999997
for lumbering

3971.839 --> 3976.839
it's like this walking robot so that the

3975.119 --> 3979.76
forest floor isn't

3976.839 --> 3981.92
disturbed so there's already application

3979.76 --> 3983.44
for walking mechanisms by the way those

3981.92 --> 3986.2400000000002
are manned

3983.44 --> 3988.7200000000003
those things those aren't pure robots so

3986.24 --> 3990.24
it there's already

3988.72 --> 3993.5989999999997
uses for

3990.24 --> 3996.72
like legged transportation systems

3993.599 --> 3996.7200000000003
instead of wheeled

3999.52 --> 4005.72
raw robot reindeer i wouldn't i wouldn't

4002.24 --> 4005.72
try that out

4009.039 --> 4014.599
yeah

4010.72 --> 4014.5989999999997
it's probably just oil

4020.0 --> 4023.0
um

4065.2 --> 4069.24
all right let me get some tea

4076.799 --> 4081.119
the loaders from alien

4079.039 --> 4084.96
like what ripley uses

4081.119 --> 4084.96
are you so sure they don't exist

4085.68 --> 4092.3999999999996
i think they probably do exist

4088.4 --> 4092.4
but here's the thing right

4093.28 --> 4099.12
complicated mechanisms

4096.48 --> 4102.159
like that like

4099.12 --> 4103.679
yeah well like a basically exo suits

4102.159 --> 4105.759
there is

4103.679 --> 4107.679
in my

4105.759 --> 4110.48
vision

4107.679 --> 4112.88
there's like wearing problems with those

4110.48 --> 4115.199
so they could be made to exist

4112.88 --> 4116.4800000000005
but they're not standardized

4115.199 --> 4120.799
because they're like

4116.48 --> 4123.3589999999995
highly flexible units but they probably

4120.799 --> 4126.56
break down quickly and are extremely

4123.359 --> 4128.08
expensive to keep maintenance

4126.56 --> 4129.759
to keep maintained

4128.08 --> 4131.44
that's what i think

4129.759 --> 4135.279
right

4131.44 --> 4138.08
because industry needs units that can

4135.279 --> 4139.839000000001
stand the test the time

4138.08 --> 4141.839
then it becomes

4139.839 --> 4145.2789999999995
useful because if

4141.839 --> 4147.12
like breaking down equipment is like one

4145.279 --> 4149.1990000000005
of the biggest problems in like any

4147.12 --> 4151.12
industry like you have a device oh it

4149.199 --> 4154.639999999999
works so great but it breaks down

4151.12 --> 4156.64
quickly yeah that really sucks

4154.64 --> 4158.56
that's like that breaks

4156.64 --> 4160.2390000000005
operations

4158.56 --> 4162.88
so

4160.239 --> 4164.639999999999
the reason why they don't have exosuit

4162.88 --> 4165.52
types

4164.64 --> 4168.4800000000005
of

4165.52 --> 4170.88
like industrial equipment is probably

4168.48 --> 4172.959999999999
because they break down too quickly to

4170.88 --> 4176.799
become efficient

4172.96 --> 4176.799
that's what i think seriously

4177.6 --> 4182.0
and yeah they might have them in the

4178.96 --> 4183.679
military right because that's where

4182.0 --> 4186.239
it doesn't matter if it breaks down

4183.679 --> 4188.4800000000005
quickly because it just needs to work

4186.239 --> 4191.3589999999995
very quickly

4188.48 --> 4195.28
before things get blown up

4191.359 --> 4198.0
right you don't need it an exosuit in

4195.28 --> 4199.84
the military to work like 20 years trade

4198.0 --> 4201.92
of every day working right that's

4199.84 --> 4206.6
different it's a different type of setup

4201.92 --> 4206.6
so it'll work much better for that

4216.48 --> 4222.08
right if you need something quick

4219.6 --> 4227.120000000001
quick and effective

4222.08 --> 4228.5599999999995
then probably exosuit systems are great

4227.12 --> 4231.599999999999
but if you want

4228.56 --> 4234.159000000001
a long-term durable setup then they

4231.6 --> 4236.64
don't work great that's

4234.159 --> 4239.679
basically plucking this out of the air

4236.64 --> 4239.679
but i think i'm right

4241.44 --> 4246.239
because that is how it usually works if

4243.92 --> 4248.2390000000005
something becomes standardized

4246.239 --> 4251.04
especially in industry it becomes

4248.239 --> 4253.44
standardized because it has been figured

4251.04 --> 4257.28
out that it will stand the test of time

4253.44 --> 4257.28
otherwise it doesn't become standardized

4257.44 --> 4261.5199999999995
because yeah

4259.28 --> 4264.0
corporations won't buy it because it's a

4261.52 --> 4266.64
high maintenance thing and it will often

4264.0 --> 4266.64
not be worth

4270.84 --> 4277.52
it unless they're just doing it to pimp

4274.159 --> 4279.12
but yeah that's not gonna last

4277.52 --> 4280.719
because yeah there's that too that you

4279.12 --> 4283.44
can just like oh i have the highest

4280.719 --> 4286.4800000000005
highest of tech just to pimp just to be

4283.44 --> 4289.199
like oh look at me i'm so modern

4286.48 --> 4291.599999999999
but that's just a pimp it's not really

4289.199 --> 4293.839999999999
adorable strategy

4291.6 --> 4293.84
right

4299.28 --> 4304.96
do you think that one day they will

4300.8 --> 4307.1990000000005
revive frozen heads and bodies no

4304.96 --> 4307.199
nope

4308.48 --> 4313.48
i don't think they'll successfully do

4310.48 --> 4313.48
that

4316.88 --> 4323.04
i mean who's to say that even if they

4319.76 --> 4328.6
manage to biologically keep it alive

4323.04 --> 4328.6
that the spirit's not just gone right

4328.719 --> 4332.4
after all that time

4330.64 --> 4334.8
this is likelihood that spear is just

4332.4 --> 4337.92
going to be like okay yeah effectively

4334.8 --> 4339.28
my body is dead now like oh i like maybe

4337.92 --> 4343.12
the spirit

4339.28 --> 4344.5599999999995
wants to move on you know

4343.12 --> 4346.0
like what if you

4344.56 --> 4348.64
effectively

4346.0 --> 4351.12
get in suspended animation like that and

4348.64 --> 4353.76
you're effectively dead and your spirit

4351.12 --> 4355.28
transcends your body and like oh yeah

4353.76 --> 4358.64
this is the life that's right in front

4355.28 --> 4359.759999999999
of me if i just let this go

4358.64 --> 4364.4800000000005
you know

4359.76 --> 4366.08
are you gonna wait like 20 80 years

4364.48 --> 4368.239
just lingering

4366.08 --> 4369.5199999999995
while you could be moving on

4368.239 --> 4371.28
you know

4369.52 --> 4373.4400000000005
i know that's kind of a weird question

4371.28 --> 4373.44
but

4376.719 --> 4382.96
isn't cryo exposes yeah well technically

4380.48 --> 4386.4
what they rested on what the scam rested

4382.96 --> 4388.4800000000005
on was we don't know how to successfully

4386.4 --> 4392.159
reanimate you now

4388.48 --> 4392.159
but in the future we will

4395.199 --> 4399.919999999999
except

4396.8 --> 4402.56
when they do figure out how to do that

4399.92 --> 4405.52
they'll probably also realize that the

4402.56 --> 4407.679
ones that they have already frozen have

4405.52 --> 4410.0
not undergone the proper procedure in

4407.679 --> 4413.1990000000005
order to be able to reanimate them

4410.0 --> 4415.679
properly again right so maybe in the

4413.199 --> 4419.919999999999
future it'll work those people that have

4415.679 --> 4419.92
already gone there probably not

4420.0 --> 4423.92
it was probably just a

4422.159 --> 4425.28
pipe dream

4423.92 --> 4428.159
for them

4425.28 --> 4430.8
because usually reanimation requires

4428.159 --> 4431.679
very specific

4430.8 --> 4434.56
uh

4431.679 --> 4436.4
stasis processes

4434.56 --> 4437.52
if you're just gonna freeze somebody

4436.4 --> 4440.48
yeah

4437.52 --> 4442.8
it's gonna damage everything

4440.48 --> 4444.32
if you don't know exactly

4442.8 --> 4446.719
what you need to do

4444.32 --> 4450.0
anyway i don't know too much about it i

4446.719 --> 4451.92
know enough to know that

4450.0 --> 4454.0
so yeah

4451.92 --> 4456.64
i remember the whole cryo thing like in

4454.0 --> 4456.64
the 90s

4456.88 --> 4460.719
i even talked about it in my school

4465.76 --> 4470.56
there's a frog in alaska freezes solid

4468.48 --> 4473.28
for months and then thaws in the spring

4470.56 --> 4474.719
must be yeah if you're a frog seeking

4473.28 --> 4477.84
star water

4474.719 --> 4481.04
so yeah by that logical connection there

4477.84 --> 4484.2390000000005
will be people that will be like oh okay

4481.04 --> 4487.84
the frog can freeze okay so all we need

4484.239 --> 4491.839999999999
to do is just genetically modify you

4487.84 --> 4493.4400000000005
with the frozen frog genes so you can do

4491.84 --> 4495.92
that too

4493.44 --> 4497.04
right you know that's what they will

4495.92 --> 4498.8
then

4497.04 --> 4501.92
try

4498.8 --> 4501.92
is that really worth it

4502.8 --> 4507.92
right

4504.88 --> 4510.8
you want to become a frog human hybrid

4507.92 --> 4512.96
just to be able to be thawed

4510.8 --> 4515.52
from cryostasis

4512.96 --> 4517.92
is is that worth it all

4515.52 --> 4517.92
you know

4522.4 --> 4527.599999999999
or unless they just find like a key

4525.28 --> 4529.759999999999
substance that's in that frog and then

4527.6 --> 4531.84
just learn how to extract it and they

4529.76 --> 4533.280000000001
just inject you with that and that you

4531.84 --> 4536.159000000001
can do it maybe you don't need to be

4533.28 --> 4539.48
genetically modified into a frog

4536.159 --> 4539.48
i don't know

4540.08 --> 4544.5199999999995
but probably you do

4552.239 --> 4555.12
dude what

4558.719 --> 4561.76
really matthew

4561.92 --> 4565.4400000000005
what

4563.36 --> 4568.88
mice

4565.44 --> 4571.199
frozen mice they defrost and then they

4568.88 --> 4574.159000000001
live again

4571.199 --> 4574.159
are you now

4574.32 --> 4576.5599999999995
what

4577.36 --> 4582.88
i've never heard of that that's freaky

4580.159 --> 4582.879999999999
are you sure

4591.84 --> 4595.52
froggy clown schwab

4594.48 --> 4597.678999999999
right

4595.52 --> 4600.400000000001
oh who knows what klaus swabs done with

4597.679 --> 4603.96
himself genetically

4600.4 --> 4603.96
who knows man

4616.4 --> 4620.5599999999995
like matthew where are you getting this

4618.159 --> 4623.28
do you have any reference to that i'd

4620.56 --> 4626.56
like to see some sourcing on that i've

4623.28 --> 4626.5599999999995
never heard of that before

4626.64 --> 4630.64
it's kind of freaky

4629.679 --> 4633.12
really

4630.64 --> 4634.84
mice can just defrost and then come back

4633.12 --> 4639.48
to life what

4634.84 --> 4639.4800000000005
the never heard of that

4657.52 --> 4660.52
so

4683.84 --> 4687.84
a friend of you told about it

4689.28 --> 4693.04
okay

4690.48 --> 4696.4
well matthew hall

4693.04 --> 4699.12
you might have to consider that he might

4696.4 --> 4701.44
be making up tall stories if he hasn't

4699.12 --> 4703.12
actually demonstrated that with film or

4701.44 --> 4705.28
something

4703.12 --> 4707.44
because that's that sounds like one of

4705.28 --> 4710.48
those tall tales i i used to have

4707.44 --> 4712.08
friends too that that told me these kind

4710.48 --> 4714.32
of things too

4712.08 --> 4717.44
which turned out to be complete [ __ ]

4714.32 --> 4719.92
and they just like to make it up

4717.44 --> 4722.58
because it was like a compulsive story

4719.92 --> 4724.4
[ __ ] story maker

4722.58 --> 4726.8
[Music]

4724.4 --> 4729.199
and i was super gullible i would believe

4726.8 --> 4731.92
every [ __ ] thing he said which is

4729.199 --> 4734.48
really embarrassing

4731.92 --> 4735.76
it's like when i was a little kid

4734.48 --> 4739.36
but uh

4735.76 --> 4739.360000000001
yeah i've never heard of that ever

4742.32 --> 4747.199
to frozen fish reanimated okay but

4745.04 --> 4750.56
that's a fish

4747.199 --> 4752.96
okay fish are freaky

4750.56 --> 4756.4800000000005
i believe it with fish

4752.96 --> 4756.4800000000005
i don't believe it with a mouse

4757.28 --> 4763.36
i mean a mouse is basically a mammal

4760.56 --> 4765.679
a vermin type mammal but it still it's

4763.36 --> 4767.92
just like no way

4765.679 --> 4769.84
it those creatures are not built to be

4767.92 --> 4772.0
freaking frozen

4769.84 --> 4773.52
fish are in the sea there's ice in the

4772.0 --> 4775.44
sea

4773.52 --> 4777.6
and [ __ ] and whatever

4775.44 --> 4780.799999999999
like i believe fish could survive that

4777.6 --> 4784.08
with their types of fat and all that

4780.8 --> 4786.2390000000005
and yeah i think that

4784.08 --> 4789.04
yeah i don't see that as like oh my god

4786.239 --> 4791.839999999999
that could never happen but with mice

4789.04 --> 4795.719
that is a bit of a stretch i want to see

4791.84 --> 4795.719
a demonstration of that

4812.239 --> 4815.239
laughs

4820.639 --> 4824.2390000000005
all right

4821.92 --> 4826.88
anyway i'm gonna round out the show

4824.239 --> 4829.12
it's already

4826.88 --> 4831.12
3 p.m

4829.12 --> 4832.8
too bad because it's just a good flow

4831.12 --> 4834.5599999999995
man i hope tomorrow is going to be one

4832.8 --> 4837.4400000000005
of those shows again and i will try to

4834.56 --> 4839.280000000001
be more on time sorry about that

4837.44 --> 4841.678999999999
hey brandon

4839.28 --> 4844.48
yeah cold versus warm blood exactly so

4841.679 --> 4847.28
that that's yeah that was what i was

4844.48 --> 4848.879999999999
