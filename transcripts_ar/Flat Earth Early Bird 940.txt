223.04 --> 231.599
predictor oh whatever

all right uh

266.32 --> 270.24
right in the u.s it's still hot

270.4 --> 274.4
you're still dealing with that really

272.72 --> 277.04
strange

274.4 --> 277.03999999999996
heat wave

280.32 --> 283.84
well not in europe anymore

294.84 --> 300.23999999999995
right

297.04 --> 310.639
43. she wow in india

300.24 --> 315.68
43 degrees sheesh

310.639 --> 315.68
man that's that's super blazing

316.24 --> 318.56
man

322.84 --> 328.0
anyway

325.199 --> 338.72
yesterday flat earth debates were were

328.0 --> 343.12
pretty amusing

338.72 --> 343.12
so nathan was added against this glower

345.68 --> 353.84000000000003
the anti-portal star situation it was

348.4 --> 353.84
quite silly really

363.759 --> 370.24
all right uh other than that

367.759 --> 370.24
let's see

374.479 --> 379.36
oh yeah kiwi live also yeah again i just

378.16 --> 382.16
sat there in chat

379.36 --> 382.16
most of the time

383.28 --> 388.15999999999997
it's more bones talk or rather in this

386.0 --> 390.88
case

388.16 --> 391.6
it wasn't really about bones as it was

390.88 --> 395.84
about

391.6 --> 395.84000000000003
what was it again

396.24 --> 399.919
fish right

400.0 --> 404.16
so it was kind of typical that the show

402.639 --> 406.88
about bones

404.16 --> 408.0
but like half the time it was talk about

406.88 --> 411.28
fish

408.0 --> 414.319
about hair rings in this case so i

411.28 --> 419.36999999999995
thought it was a bit of a herring

414.319 --> 426.009
almost a red herring but not red anyway

419.37 --> 426.009
[Music]

428.0 --> 434.319
last night's premiere you mean the one

431.28 --> 439.84
from the replay from the day

434.319 --> 439.84000000000003
or from yesterday i mean the day before

441.199 --> 444.479
what does anti-portal star situation

443.84 --> 448.23999999999995
mean

444.479 --> 452.8
it means that it is assumed

448.24 --> 455.52
that this yeah that the celestial sphere

452.8 --> 458.08
is literal and that there's like the the

455.52 --> 460.88
stars you don't see

458.08 --> 464.8
are on the other side that's what

460.88 --> 467.759
antipodal star situation means

464.8 --> 468.16
right and yeah you're gonna assume a

467.759 --> 472.16
star

468.16 --> 475.12
antipodal star stars if you assume the

472.16 --> 475.12
earth is a globe

475.199 --> 480.08000000000004
underneath all those stars right

478.96 --> 481.75899999999996
you're going to assume that if you're

480.08 --> 483.039
going to go to the other side of the

481.759 --> 486.08000000000004
globe where the other

483.039 --> 488.15999999999997
half of the celestial sphere is visible

486.08 --> 490.71999999999997
i'm already suggesting it by saying

488.16 --> 493.759
other half

490.72 --> 496.40000000000003
but yeah it's a suggestion that it is

493.759 --> 502.16
literally anti-portal

496.4 --> 504.56
but yet you can't really prove that

502.16 --> 507.84000000000003
of course and yeah the whole thing got

504.56 --> 507.84
stuck on that

513.2 --> 521.839
it was it was amusing

546.839 --> 549.839
and

554.399 --> 558.48
alrighty i didn't watch any i couldn't

557.12 --> 561.92
find any

558.48 --> 563.519
interesting new movies or anything

561.92 --> 567.1999999999999
because i was to just kind of play

563.519 --> 569.44
games and listen to a bit of info wars

567.2 --> 571.6
and watch a bit of football

569.44 --> 574.1600000000001
all that had a pretty laid back day

571.6 --> 574.16
yesterday

574.839 --> 577.839
huh

602.88 --> 605.8389999999999
okay

607.04 --> 611.92
don't want what are you talking about

609.04 --> 611.92
here we go again

617.36 --> 633.839
what which show is that

630.839 --> 633.839
hmm

649.839 --> 656.48
oh the whole sexton talk one yeah oh i

653.76 --> 658.64
i didn't see that i was barely there

656.48 --> 663.6
during that show

658.64 --> 663.6
i think that's the one from monday

664.399 --> 675.839
i was barely active in that one i i

667.12 --> 675.839
didn't really see it back

686.839 --> 691.36
so

689.04 --> 691.36
all right

693.68 --> 703.12
yeah own benjamin also had a new stream

697.04 --> 706.959
but i yeah didn't get to watching it yet

703.12 --> 710.32
so i don't know what that was about

706.959 --> 716.8
i'll watch that somewhere this afternoon

710.32 --> 718.24
after the fed all ends

716.8 --> 721.1999999999999
right other than that i'm kind of a

718.24 --> 721.2
blank slate here

723.04 --> 728.88
oh man today i'm supposedly doing my

726.079 --> 731.519
last newspaper round

728.88 --> 733.8389999999999
but i already took a look at the front

731.519 --> 735.68
cover and it's freaking vaccine [ __ ]

733.839 --> 738.48
again so this one is going straight into

735.68 --> 738.4799999999999
the paper bin

738.639 --> 744.0
in a way i'm kind of glad that

741.92 --> 746.3199999999999
yeah that this newspaper is kind of

744.0 --> 749.68
lifting here because it it was just too

746.32 --> 749.6800000000001
much corona garbage i

750.16 --> 753.92
if it wouldn't have lifted i would have

752.639 --> 756.16
eventually

753.92 --> 757.4399999999999
at some point this year just said like

756.16 --> 760.88
guys i'm quitting

757.44 --> 762.48
this garbage it's too much corona

760.88 --> 763.12
garbage i don't want to be part of this

762.48 --> 772.48
anymore

763.12 --> 774.8
so uh

772.48 --> 774.8000000000001
hmm

776.56 --> 781.92
oh here you go again i guess i

778.24 --> 783.839
completely missed that one twice

781.92 --> 785.04
or maybe i did listen to it in the

783.839 --> 788.32
background it just

785.04 --> 788.3199999999999
didn't have my attention

788.399 --> 793.04
with it i do remember the scene though

790.88 --> 797.68
about

793.04 --> 801.8389999999999
when 10th man explained what is it

797.68 --> 801.8389999999999
circles of equal altitude

803.2 --> 807.12
that's like the only thing i remember

805.2 --> 808.32
from that because that's the first time

807.12 --> 810.88
i heard about that

808.32 --> 813.36
terminology it was interesting what kind

810.88 --> 816.56
of new job are you looking for what

813.36 --> 816.5600000000001
what are you talking about

818.639 --> 823.12
new job i haven't actually even thought

822.079 --> 829.8389999999999
about it

823.12 --> 829.839
all that much i don't know

835.12 --> 843.839
i don't know if i am gonna replace it i

837.36 --> 843.839
was barely making money of it anyway

856.56 --> 871.8389999999999
so yeah uh i guess i'll have to think

859.68 --> 871.8389999999999
about that one

900.079 --> 907.3599999999999
i mean i don't know man instead of

905.12 --> 909.6
getting some kind of another side job i

907.36 --> 909.6
could

910.839 --> 913.2790000000001
maybe

911.98 --> 927.839
[Music]

913.279 --> 927.8389999999999
think about something else

940.399 --> 944.8
maybe get back into goldsmith yeah but

942.48 --> 944.8000000000001
that's

948.959 --> 954.2399999999999
if i could look as a hobby that's very

952.839 --> 956.639
expensive i

954.24 --> 958.399
don't have the funds for that absolutely

956.639 --> 961.6
not but

958.399 --> 962.399
who knows man if i if i'd somehow get an

961.6 --> 969.839
order

962.399 --> 969.839
then yeah technically i could do that

979.36 --> 986.639
i would have to seek out like one of the

983.199 --> 990.24
jeweler that you yeah the

986.639 --> 991.44
jewel store that have like a little gold

990.24 --> 994.8
smithing corner

991.44 --> 997.12
and i could ask them like hey can i

994.8 --> 998.3199999999999
like rent this can i work here at some

997.12 --> 1000.639
point

998.32 --> 1003.36
to do an assignment probably i think

1000.639 --> 1006.5600000000001
that is a possibility but

1003.36 --> 1009.12
yeah it would be

1006.56 --> 1010.399
quite a hassle because i'd have to like

1009.12 --> 1012.9590000000001
take all the stuff

1010.399 --> 1014.8
move it there and every time i would

1012.959 --> 1017.1199999999999
want to work on it i had to

1014.8 --> 1018.56
would have to travel for like 15 minutes

1017.12 --> 1021.6
at least

1018.56 --> 1023.199
through whatever weather uh so yeah i'm

1021.6 --> 1027.199
being a

1023.199 --> 1027.199
little obstructionist about it but

1034.64 --> 1041.8390000000002
it's right yeah well could do that

1039.36 --> 1042.8799999999999
not being oh okay yeah well you could

1041.839 --> 1053.84
also just

1042.88 --> 1053.8400000000001
be banned for attitude

1064.84 --> 1067.84
so

1078.24 --> 1085.76
i mean i do this freaking show every day

1082.24 --> 1085.76
and i'm on the flat earth debates

1087.039 --> 1091.919
and i did my newest paper round so said

1090.08 --> 1095.84
really that lazy

1091.919 --> 1099.44
constantly doing something

1095.84 --> 1101.9189999999999
constantly watching stuff

1099.44 --> 1103.679
but not just to waste my time but to

1101.919 --> 1107.44
kind of get something out of it

1103.679 --> 1110.72
because [ __ ] that's just purely lame

1107.44 --> 1110.72
i avoid that anyway

1115.55 --> 1118.68
[Music]

1119.84 --> 1127.12
all right but dude pegasus thorne is

1123.28 --> 1130.96
is probably just one of those guys

1127.12 --> 1133.4399999999998
that thinks oh you are doing this

1130.96 --> 1134.88
because you are poor and you're doing

1133.44 --> 1138.0800000000002
this to get money

1134.88 --> 1139.0390000000002
so if you get easier money in some other

1138.08 --> 1142.1599999999999
way

1139.039 --> 1145.44
then you'll finally leave us alone

1142.16 --> 1151.8400000000001
no no

1145.44 --> 1151.8400000000001
i don't think so

1153.679 --> 1161.039
does nathan pay much to fed panelists

1158.16 --> 1161.039
no not really

1163.679 --> 1169.52
or rather nothing but he does give

1166.88 --> 1169.5200000000002
shout outs

1172.48 --> 1178.96
and yeah to be fair nathan has actually

1175.36 --> 1182.799
sent me paypal donations

1178.96 --> 1185.6000000000001
but maybe i think sometimes that

1182.799 --> 1186.799
like he just wants to feed the rumors

1185.6 --> 1188.8799999999999
like on purpose

1186.799 --> 1190.799
just to say like yeah [ __ ] you keep

1188.88 --> 1194.0
squirting [ __ ]

1190.799 --> 1196.799
i don't care i'm going to do something

1194.0 --> 1197.76
that to you seems highly suspicious so

1196.799 --> 1200.08
you could go

1197.76 --> 1203.12
could go nuts over it well it literally

1200.08 --> 1203.12
doesn't mean anything

1203.679 --> 1209.919
if anything nathan like has

1206.88 --> 1212.24
donated to me because he he

1209.919 --> 1214.3200000000002
actually supports my formula and he

1212.24 --> 1217.6
appreciates my efforts

1214.32 --> 1220.3999999999999
even though yeah i am not mr

1217.6 --> 1221.9189999999999
super fluent show every day always

1220.4 --> 1224.96
talking always interesting

1221.919 --> 1227.2800000000002
no i'm not always interesting i know

1224.96 --> 1235.8400000000001
but i have my moments and i cherish

1227.28 --> 1235.84
those moments

1238.799 --> 1244.559
only what he paypals right well

1242.559 --> 1249.84
most of you guys that have donated have

1244.559 --> 1249.84
already surpassed his donations by far

1250.08 --> 1256.1589999999999
he he just has a bit of a trickle-down

1252.48 --> 1256.159
attitude so when he has

1256.72 --> 1261.679
like when his income comes in then he

1259.679 --> 1264.48
feels kind of rich and then he like

1261.679 --> 1267.3600000000001
trickles it down to me i think i think

1264.48 --> 1267.3600000000001
that's what he does

1268.08 --> 1271.84
and i appreciate that i am kind of like

1270.48 --> 1273.679
that too

1271.84 --> 1275.6
when i have too much money i have a lot

1273.679 --> 1278.0
of tendency to just

1275.6 --> 1280.8799999999999
spread it around and spread the joy kind

1278.0 --> 1280.88
of attitude

1281.039 --> 1284.559
hey dutch sailor good to see you

1288.799 --> 1293.9189999999999
it's all about waking up people yeah it

1291.76 --> 1293.919
is

1297.2 --> 1301.2
but there's a bit of a complication with

1299.6 --> 1304.8799999999999
it though

1301.2 --> 1309.2
because you kind of already have to be

1304.88 --> 1312.5590000000002
woken up so in some form

1309.2 --> 1315.76
to actually reach this place

1312.559 --> 1318.799
to to reach my show like

1315.76 --> 1322.08
there is no way you're going to be

1318.799 --> 1323.36
directly from out of a complete cheap

1322.08 --> 1327.4399999999998
position

1323.36 --> 1330.8799999999999
totally bought into everything

1327.44 --> 1333.1200000000001
from that vantage point you're not gonna

1330.88 --> 1334.7990000000002
bump into the flat earth early bird show

1333.12 --> 1336.4799999999998
i don't see it happening and if they

1334.799 --> 1339.6
would they'd be like

1336.48 --> 1343.039
really confused perhaps

1339.6 --> 1344.08
and just like just completely confused

1343.039 --> 1347.6
and then just

1344.08 --> 1350.6399999999999
skip it to the next one out of a

1347.6 --> 1356.24
million youtube shows or you know

1350.64 --> 1358.5590000000002
so to actually really

1356.24 --> 1363.36
awaken further you kind of already have

1358.559 --> 1363.36
to be awakened to even get to this show

1366.88 --> 1370.3200000000002
right i'm not the guy

1371.919 --> 1376.3200000000002
to pull the plant out of the swamp

1378.88 --> 1385.6000000000001
i'm or the guy that if this the plant

1382.08 --> 1387.9189999999999
has already crawled out of the swamp

1385.6 --> 1389.4399999999998
to then replant it in a good place

1387.919 --> 1393.2
that's rather what i do

1389.44 --> 1393.2
i don't actually pull them out of the

1400.84 --> 1404.799
swamp

1402.0 --> 1405.2
i'm more the guy that if they yeah if

1404.799 --> 1408.1589999999999
you

1405.2 --> 1411.28
awaken and you get all the nasty side

1408.159 --> 1414.88
effects that do happen

1411.28 --> 1418.0
because of reality seeping in finally

1414.88 --> 1419.7600000000002
right reality has nasty side effects

1418.0 --> 1422.08
unfortunately

1419.76 --> 1423.36
and that's where i'm good at that's what

1422.08 --> 1425.84
when i help

1423.36 --> 1428.32
and assist and basically tell you yeah

1425.84 --> 1431.84
it looks like this right now

1428.32 --> 1432.96
but from vast experience and reflection

1431.84 --> 1435.12
with other people

1432.96 --> 1436.24
this is how it's going to transpire for

1435.12 --> 1439.6
you

1436.24 --> 1442.32
like don't feel discouraged by the

1439.6 --> 1445.84
temporary

1442.32 --> 1445.84
[ __ ] coming over you

1447.039 --> 1450.72
etc etc anyway

1455.12 --> 1462.1589999999999
i do that and yeah

1458.4 --> 1463.6000000000001
i don't know i keep track of you guys

1462.159 --> 1465.679
all of you

1463.6 --> 1466.8799999999999
and what you do what you bring to the

1465.679 --> 1468.88
table what

1466.88 --> 1472.24
your personalities are what your

1468.88 --> 1475.3600000000001
personal quests are

1472.24 --> 1477.919
what your trials are and i just try to

1475.36 --> 1482.6399999999999
help everybody keep track

1477.919 --> 1482.64
it's almost it's almost like a farmer

1482.799 --> 1501.84
but a farmer of

1486.0 --> 1501.84
i get a farmer off ascension

1502.0 --> 1508.48
what kind of proactive effort have you

1504.64 --> 1508.48
done to help market your child

1511.76 --> 1516.48
not really proactive efforts to be fair

1515.039 --> 1518.8799999999999
when you're going to use a word like

1516.48 --> 1522.0
that market terminology

1518.88 --> 1525.919
no but what i do do

1522.0 --> 1526.799
is go over the place especially when i

1525.919 --> 1530.24
feel like it

1526.799 --> 1532.08
i'm talking about discord and other live

1530.24 --> 1534.48
streams with chats and i do

1532.08 --> 1538.0
represent and i do tell people like hey

1534.48 --> 1538.0
yeah i have an everyday show

1540.32 --> 1543.84
and i've had it for a long time

1544.4 --> 1548.4
and i use it as a

1548.559 --> 1554.08
to represent my

1551.84 --> 1555.279
long-term influence and that i've had

1554.08 --> 1558.24
ideas way back

1555.279 --> 1560.0
on records that are becoming more and

1558.24 --> 1561.84
more relevant

1560.0 --> 1564.48
and that they're getting recognition so

1561.84 --> 1568.24
i represent myself

1564.48 --> 1571.1200000000001
to individuals and that's about it

1568.24 --> 1571.84
that's about what i do i i don't really

1571.12 --> 1575.279
like go

1571.84 --> 1577.279
on advertisement sprees

1575.279 --> 1578.559
especially to places where i don't

1577.279 --> 1580.32
really know people

1578.559 --> 1581.84
and that's typically what you do when

1580.32 --> 1583.84
you advertise you go to

1581.84 --> 1585.36
like random places you've never been and

1583.84 --> 1588.24
you just drop

1585.36 --> 1590.24
the data the link and hope somebody

1588.24 --> 1592.96
comes

1590.24 --> 1593.6
i don't really do that what i do do

1592.96 --> 1596.08
however

1593.6 --> 1597.279
is tell everybody to share the show at

1596.08 --> 1600.72
the start and that

1597.279 --> 1600.72
yeah at the start of the show

1601.36 --> 1610.0
it's built into my intro

1604.72 --> 1610.0
song intro riddle my routine

1611.6 --> 1616.3999999999999
it's really become like a very much a

1614.32 --> 1619.12
routine thing

1616.4 --> 1619.76
uh yeah and i hope that people do share

1619.12 --> 1621.52
it people do

1619.76 --> 1624.4
tell me they share it i don't know where

1621.52 --> 1624.4
they're sharing it

1624.799 --> 1628.799
but hey if people yeah if you deem a

1627.919 --> 1633.5200000000002
platform

1628.799 --> 1635.039
fit for my input

1633.52 --> 1636.8799999999999
and that's a bit of a risk i guess

1635.039 --> 1640.48
sometimes

1636.88 --> 1643.1200000000001
but yeah why not

1640.48 --> 1645.44
you could effectively be doing the

1643.12 --> 1655.84
proactive advertising

1645.44 --> 1655.8400000000001
for me by sharing the show

1659.4 --> 1662.5790000000002
[Music]

1666.84 --> 1671.6789999999999
uh

1668.64 --> 1671.679
okay gaining wisdom

1680.84 --> 1683.84
what

1687.6 --> 1697.84
did he put a price on your head what is

1690.72 --> 1697.84
going on

1737.919 --> 1742.5590000000002
hmm right right i guess gaining wisdom

1741.36 --> 1745.84
your

1742.559 --> 1749.6
father-in-law kind of

1745.84 --> 1750.559
gave you the the man responsibility of

1749.6 --> 1767.84
the house

1750.559 --> 1767.84
i guess for his daughters

1778.84 --> 1781.84
hmm

1782.64 --> 1795.8400000000001
uh what terror 306

1786.72 --> 1795.84
jesus versus satan the sun and saturn no

1804.24 --> 1812.32
i mean like within the uh

1808.399 --> 1816.08
astrology perhaps that's how it's

1812.32 --> 1819.6
set up but i don't think it has

1816.08 --> 1824.32
anything real to do with

1819.6 --> 1824.32
with like the the spirit of things

1824.799 --> 1831.76
like this actual spirit of jesus or like

1828.72 --> 1835.679
those that follow his way versus

1831.76 --> 1838.399
the beast the spirit of power

1835.679 --> 1838.3990000000001
and corruption

1839.2 --> 1844.88
i don't see how that has any relevance

1841.52 --> 1844.8799999999999
to like the celestials

1847.039 --> 1852.559
santos oh yeah no surprise there

1850.48 --> 1855.3600000000001
well it's really nice to point out those

1852.559 --> 1857.12
correlations like oh yeah and

1855.36 --> 1858.559
when you compare it to the celestials

1857.12 --> 1860.7199999999998
then it's this and then it's that

1858.559 --> 1862.84
and then yeah then it doesn't mean [ __ ]

1860.72 --> 1864.32
and then you abandon it and that's

1862.84 --> 1866.399
exactly

1864.32 --> 1868.559
what gnostics do with that [ __ ] it's

1866.399 --> 1872.0
like oh yeah yeah yeah look oh no

1868.559 --> 1874.96
jesus is the sun so that means that

1872.0 --> 1879.84
everything else is [ __ ] yeah i know

1874.96 --> 1879.8400000000001
that's what they do

1885.279 --> 1889.6
jesus is lord krishna okay

1890.84 --> 1893.84
uh

1894.64 --> 1910.3990000000001
of sorts i guess tear it 306.

1906.88 --> 1913.3600000000001
no religions based on the lights no

1910.399 --> 1916.08
no george sanford it's not based on the

1913.36 --> 1921.84
lights in the sky

1916.08 --> 1921.84
the lights in the sky are merely a

1924.399 --> 1931.279
merely more like a playbook by which

1927.919 --> 1934.48
the actual happening of things

1931.279 --> 1936.48
in the world with real people

1934.48 --> 1938.64
it's more yeah it's the playbook it's

1936.48 --> 1942.559
the setting

1938.64 --> 1945.6000000000001
of the format of the story

1942.559 --> 1949.84
it's not literal

1945.6 --> 1949.84
you understand

1974.84 --> 1977.84
so

1988.84 --> 1994.0
hmm

1991.6 --> 2005.84
i'm hearing a weird zoom i don't know

1994.0 --> 2005.84
where it's coming from

2007.44 --> 2012.0800000000002
yeah it is my computer i don't know

2012.88 --> 2018.0800000000002
maybe it's the level of humidity that

2014.799 --> 2021.12
just makes things sound differently

2018.08 --> 2024.399
you know air pressure humidity levels

2021.12 --> 2027.6789999999999
it all makes a slight difference in how

2024.399 --> 2030.559
sound actually goes about

2027.679 --> 2032.64
i'm super sound sensitive so it's just

2030.559 --> 2033.84
like hey where is this sound coming from

2032.64 --> 2037.3600000000001
i'm not used to this

2033.84 --> 2040.48
oh wait it's probably because it's 16

2037.36 --> 2047.84
degrees with 96 percent humidity

2040.48 --> 2047.84
which is very rare

2052.48 --> 2061.839
my door is too yeah it is territ but

2055.119 --> 2061.839
there's a balcony door on the other side

2062.399 --> 2068.24
hey ralph rodriguez what delta for ryan

2072.839 --> 2075.839
[ __ ]

2086.839 --> 2089.839
so

2097.2 --> 2103.839
all that

2106.16 --> 2109.7599999999998
i'm seeing you in a while ralph

2110.0 --> 2117.839
welcome back hope you're doing all right

2119.4 --> 2122.7490000000003
[Music]

2142.48 --> 2159.839
sleep schedules changed okay

2183.44 --> 2187.839
no good servant no i haven't

2212.839 --> 2217.44
um

2214.48 --> 2218.88
right dude there is no delta for ryan

2217.44 --> 2223.68
it's all virtual it's

2218.88 --> 2223.6800000000003
all [ __ ] like all of it

2224.4 --> 2230.7200000000003
like even the freaking tools

2227.44 --> 2232.8
to eventually take it all down

2230.72 --> 2233.839
and punish them all according to what

2232.8 --> 2237.04
they done

2233.839 --> 2239.68
even that part is all [ __ ] and they

2237.04 --> 2242.16
want to shove it in our face they want

2239.68 --> 2246.24
to make us believe

2242.16 --> 2246.72
like they will be this all for a real

2246.24 --> 2250.0
thing

2246.72 --> 2253.04
right they just want to make

2250.0 --> 2253.839
everybody permanently believe it was all

2253.04 --> 2256.16
going to be

2253.839 --> 2258.64
for a real thing that everything about

2256.16 --> 2260.64
it is all real that it's really a virus

2258.64 --> 2262.0789999999997
that it really came from a lab who gives

2260.64 --> 2264.3199999999997
a [ __ ]

2262.079 --> 2266.48
it's an inanimate substance it's

2264.32 --> 2268.2400000000002
ridiculous and it is really dangerous

2266.48 --> 2270.32
and it's really mutating

2268.24 --> 2272.8799999999997
and that it was really evil of those

2270.32 --> 2276.1600000000003
people and then it was contained and

2272.88 --> 2280.6400000000003
whatever and then justice

2276.16 --> 2282.64
right even though all of it is fake

2280.64 --> 2284.0
the ones that are being part of that

2282.64 --> 2287.44
playbook as the evil

2284.0 --> 2290.48
guys they will all

2287.44 --> 2294.2400000000002
fall for it they will all fall

2290.48 --> 2297.359
to justice just to [ __ ]

2294.24 --> 2300.0789999999997
reinforce the lies of it all

2297.359 --> 2300.56
that anything actually happened other

2300.079 --> 2304.8
that

2300.56 --> 2308.48
people were lured into taking poison

2304.8 --> 2308.48
out of blind trust

2309.599 --> 2315.52
for groups and fronts

2312.72 --> 2316.56
and organizations that were blatantly

2315.52 --> 2320.48
obviously not

2316.56 --> 2322.72
trustworthy and that are getting more

2320.48 --> 2327.839
and more obsessed

2322.72 --> 2327.839
with hatred of human beings

2335.76 --> 2339.6800000000003
because if they make everybody believe

2337.92 --> 2343.76
that any aspect of this

2339.68 --> 2347.2
was real then after the [ __ ] is over

2343.76 --> 2348.96
and the people some people go to jail

2347.2 --> 2350.96
right probably nobody's gonna get

2348.96 --> 2352.839
executed

2350.96 --> 2354.7200000000003
which they should they should all be

2352.839 --> 2357.92
executed

2354.72 --> 2361.1189999999997
right but

2357.92 --> 2361.6800000000003
yeah and then they can do it again at a

2361.119 --> 2364.96
later

2361.68 --> 2368.16
convenient time

2364.96 --> 2370.7200000000003
yeah they can make everybody believe

2368.16 --> 2372.16
that anything about this was real then

2370.72 --> 2375.2799999999997
that means then they can

2372.16 --> 2378.3999999999996
do it over and over and over again

2375.28 --> 2380.079
forever from any side

2378.4 --> 2382.64
oh winning group oh they're not

2380.079 --> 2385.28
eugenicists well guess what

2382.64 --> 2385.68
after some time shit's gonna go down and

2385.28 --> 2390.32
then

2385.68 --> 2392.64
that group is gonna do it too

2390.32 --> 2393.839
even though they were not supposed to be

2392.64 --> 2397.359
eugenicists

2393.839 --> 2400.48
yeah they're just gonna keep on doing it

2397.359 --> 2403.7599999999998
and doing it and doing it because

2400.48 --> 2407.76
you believed anything

2403.76 --> 2409.2000000000003
about it was real you believed there was

2407.76 --> 2412.8
a virus

2409.2 --> 2415.7599999999998
and that you can make it

2412.8 --> 2416.0
and that it's supposed to be dangerous

2415.76 --> 2419.28
and

2416.0 --> 2423.28
infectious if you believed any of

2419.28 --> 2428.3190000000004
any of it then it will do it again

2423.28 --> 2428.3190000000004
and again and again and again

2428.56 --> 2432.24
and they'll just use it forever because

2431.28 --> 2439.119
you believed

2432.24 --> 2441.9199999999996
anything about it was real

2439.119 --> 2444.4
yeah a territory that's what i say too

2441.92 --> 2446.319
i'm getting really like

2444.4 --> 2448.8
whoa dude i can't believe i'm saying

2446.319 --> 2449.68
that if i'd seen myself say that 20

2448.8 --> 2451.2000000000003
years ago

2449.68 --> 2454.3999999999996
i would be like dude what the hell is

2451.2 --> 2458.16
wrong with him why is he so

2454.4 --> 2461.44
so merciless so so

2458.16 --> 2466.8799999999997
so yeah super right wing

2461.44 --> 2469.359
well now i get it because it's all a lie

2466.88 --> 2470.8
and it's not actually the specific

2469.359 --> 2474.0
actions

2470.8 --> 2474.5600000000004
no it's part of being this apparatus

2474.0 --> 2480.72
that is

2474.56 --> 2483.839
literally spellbinding people into

2480.72 --> 2485.839
into death situations without

2483.839 --> 2487.2799999999997
proper guidance of what's actually

2485.839 --> 2489.68
happening

2487.28 --> 2491.119
that's the part they all deserve to die

2489.68 --> 2493.839
for a day they all deserve to be

2491.119 --> 2497.92
executed it's

2493.839 --> 2501.7599999999998
evil wizardry necromancy poison

2497.92 --> 2504.96
this is pure evil this is pure satanic

2501.76 --> 2509.8390000000004
witchcraft there's no excuse for it

2504.96 --> 2509.839
nobody has an excuse for this

2534.839 --> 2537.839
right

2542.48 --> 2551.839
hey cleary

2583.52 --> 2588.96
right so what's practically going on out

2587.52 --> 2593.2
there now

2588.96 --> 2596.4
is that since the the true fair spell

2593.2 --> 2599.2799999999997
of kovit is over because

2596.4 --> 2601.04
people have been starting to slowly

2599.28 --> 2602.079
catch on to and then of course there's

2601.04 --> 2605.52
like oh

2602.079 --> 2607.44
oh but no i am going to make it real and

2605.52 --> 2609.44
i'm going to virtue sick now and take

2607.44 --> 2610.64
the vaccine and then be like i'll take

2609.44 --> 2612.48
the next one out

2610.64 --> 2616.56
yeah we're going to see that right

2612.48 --> 2619.68
that's basically like the babies

2616.56 --> 2620.88
that'll rather die than admit that

2619.68 --> 2624.0789999999997
they're being faked

2620.88 --> 2627.359
right you have those but that's

2624.079 --> 2630.48
a reaction that's a reaction to

2627.359 --> 2632.72
the average actually heightening

2630.48 --> 2634.2400000000002
their level of insight catching on does

2632.72 --> 2637.2799999999997
it mean that everybody's going to

2634.24 --> 2638.8799999999997
say that openly but you could feel it

2637.28 --> 2640.3190000000004
everybody's starting to notice like

2638.88 --> 2642.7200000000003
there's [ __ ] going and they're

2640.319 --> 2644.8
fooling us about this in some way

2642.72 --> 2646.64
right then there's the babies that come

2644.8 --> 2648.96
out oh rather die

2646.64 --> 2651.2799999999997
then admit that i'm being fooled right

2648.96 --> 2654.7200000000003
you get to see that [ __ ]

2651.28 --> 2658.079
but because more people are catching on

2654.72 --> 2658.8799999999997
the dynamics of the application of this

2658.079 --> 2661.92
spell

2658.88 --> 2663.04
has changed and shifted and now it's

2661.92 --> 2667.76
going to

2663.04 --> 2672.16
be border control like

2667.76 --> 2675.28
priest hood based border control right

2672.16 --> 2677.359
this is not like all political fronts

2675.28 --> 2679.0400000000004
russians versus the americans you know

2677.359 --> 2680.64
like in a cold war no no this is

2679.04 --> 2684.64
literally

2680.64 --> 2689.1189999999997
medical institutes conspiring together

2684.64 --> 2692.48
to basically create a dynamic and say

2689.119 --> 2695.76
this is you can travel there now

2692.48 --> 2699.04
because we say there is a new variant

2695.76 --> 2702.88
that's it right so there's a new

2699.04 --> 2704.4
shift in application of what cove it is

2702.88 --> 2707.92
as a spell

2704.4 --> 2711.28
in society it's now institutional

2707.92 --> 2714.0
border control based on medical

2711.28 --> 2717.28
priesthood

2714.0 --> 2721.44
that's what they shifted it into because

2717.28 --> 2723.6800000000003
can no longer be truly

2721.44 --> 2725.76
integrated into society because they're

2723.68 --> 2726.72
catching on that it's actually [ __ ]

2725.76 --> 2729.119
and mind control

2726.72 --> 2730.9599999999996
in to a limited degree and then that

2729.119 --> 2732.079
doesn't work in it you can't literally

2730.96 --> 2735.359
make an entire

2732.079 --> 2736.2400000000002
people commit suicide and anymore once

2735.359 --> 2739.52
they catch on

2736.24 --> 2742.9599999999996
to that level of deception so now

2739.52 --> 2745.92
they're shifting it into a new dynamic

2742.96 --> 2747.76
they can say oh anew for ryan's new

2745.92 --> 2750.319
variant

2747.76 --> 2752.6400000000003
that and we're gonna point exactly where

2750.319 --> 2754.64
we say those things arrive based on

2752.64 --> 2757.359
absolutely nothing

2754.64 --> 2759.68
and then that's going to change the

2757.359 --> 2761.52
international dynamics and how the

2759.68 --> 2762.72
borders are regarded and then suddenly

2761.52 --> 2765.839
oh you want to go there

2762.72 --> 2769.5989999999997
now you have to go take some more poison

2765.839 --> 2773.119
and go through more hassle to go there

2769.599 --> 2776.96
aggravating traffic between

2773.119 --> 2779.44
the new designated region as a risk

2776.96 --> 2780.88
factor right so that's what they're

2779.44 --> 2782.56
doing with it that's what they're going

2780.88 --> 2783.6800000000003
to be doing with it that's like the

2782.56 --> 2786.4
primary thing

2783.68 --> 2788.0
that it's going to have as an influence

2786.4 --> 2790.8
right even as the general

2788.0 --> 2793.52
public are starting to like scoff at the

2790.8 --> 2793.52
propaganda

2798.16 --> 2801.2799999999997
they're still going to do that they're

2799.92 --> 2806.0
still going to be

2801.28 --> 2809.28
playing with the gates of the pens

2806.0 --> 2809.92
the pens that we cattle everywhere in

2809.28 --> 2813.119
the world

2809.92 --> 2816.0
were all locked in our regions

2813.119 --> 2819.04
based on kovitt policy that's what

2816.0 --> 2822.079
they're gonna do with it

2819.04 --> 2822.88
and then based on who's gonna take the

2822.079 --> 2825.2000000000003
reins

2822.88 --> 2826.96
and how far they could push the people

2825.2 --> 2831.04
to roll down

2826.96 --> 2832.56
more gay [ __ ] more covich [ __ ] more

2831.04 --> 2834.8
climate change [ __ ]

2832.56 --> 2837.119
and if you don't comply oh guess what a

2834.8 --> 2838.96
new variety suddenly broke out oh no

2837.119 --> 2842.8
have to close off the borders

2838.96 --> 2846.16
right it's literally political sabotage

2842.8 --> 2847.8390000000004
based on medical priesthood

2846.16 --> 2849.5989999999997
that's what they're going to do it's

2847.839 --> 2850.48
already kind of being done but it's

2849.599 --> 2853.3590000000004
going to be more

2850.48 --> 2855.839
blatant more obvious to people that's

2853.359 --> 2858.88
what they're going to do

2855.839 --> 2862.16
it's another black male 2 tool

2858.88 --> 2864.1600000000003
based on universal medical

2862.16 --> 2866.3999999999996
mind control that's what they're going

2864.16 --> 2867.7599999999998
to do this is what you've got to expect

2866.4 --> 2870.4
that's going to happen that's

2867.76 --> 2872.0
how you are going to have to rearrange

2870.4 --> 2875.2000000000003
the dynamics

2872.0 --> 2876.96
of you going about in the world right

2875.2 --> 2879.1189999999997
this is the new system this is the

2876.96 --> 2882.319
neo-feudal system new

2879.119 --> 2884.839
feudalism back in the day had exactly

2882.319 --> 2888.16
the same setup

2884.839 --> 2889.52
powers which was a lot of priesthood

2888.16 --> 2891.92
power

2889.52 --> 2893.28
they basically just determined like no

2891.92 --> 2895.04
this

2893.28 --> 2896.3190000000004
these are the groups that are the slaves

2895.04 --> 2898.16
they're going to have to work or they're

2896.319 --> 2901.68
going to be punished

2898.16 --> 2904.7999999999997
these are going to have to do this and

2901.68 --> 2908.319
they would enforce that by simply being

2904.8 --> 2910.2400000000002
at the borders the castle walls

2908.319 --> 2912.24
right and if you didn't cooperate then

2910.24 --> 2914.7999999999997
the roaming armies would periodically

2912.24 --> 2917.839
come out from other nations

2914.8 --> 2920.88
and they would just destroy you

2917.839 --> 2922.5589999999997
right so they blackmailed you with

2920.88 --> 2924.48
protection back then

2922.559 --> 2926.4
in order to go along with everything

2924.48 --> 2929.119
they wanted

2926.4 --> 2929.92
it was all about border control and that

2929.119 --> 2933.2000000000003
time through

2929.92 --> 2936.2400000000002
walls and castles now

2933.2 --> 2938.64
the game is the same but in a different

2936.24 --> 2938.64
setting

2939.68 --> 2942.7999999999997
now they're gonna go with virtual

2941.68 --> 2946.0
borders

2942.8 --> 2949.6800000000003
and the priesthood is medical

2946.0 --> 2951.92
and they cost spells of who is cursed

2949.68 --> 2953.2
oh and if you go into the cursed country

2951.92 --> 2956.2400000000002
you're going to have to go

2953.2 --> 2960.24
through this special priesthood blessing

2956.24 --> 2962.5589999999997
so that it's safe for you so you don't

2960.24 --> 2965.2
get cursed by those

2962.559 --> 2966.8
curse yeah that's what they're doing

2965.2 --> 2968.0789999999997
that's what it's going to be that's what

2966.8 --> 2969.52
they're going to do right now it's going

2968.079 --> 2972.4
to last for a while

2969.52 --> 2973.839
it's going to be extremely tough to

2972.4 --> 2978.88
break this

2973.839 --> 2978.88
because it is very easy to maintain

2979.599 --> 2982.8
at this point will become more difficult

2982.24 --> 2986.16
for them

2982.8 --> 2989.3590000000004
as more of their conspiracy is routed

2986.16 --> 2994.7999999999997
piece by piece region by region

2989.359 --> 2994.7999999999997
but it's very tough to get rid of this

2996.839 --> 2999.839
anyway

3004.72 --> 3013.839
i hope i made my point clear

3018.559 --> 3027.8390000000004
vaccine is the false nectar

3032.31 --> 3035.4
[Music]

3041.119 --> 3045.839
no i see the vaccine is more like a

3048.16 --> 3057.52
yeah it's a sacrifice

3052.96 --> 3061.44
like a partial sacrifice your

3057.52 --> 3064.559
the gift that god gave you

3061.44 --> 3067.28
your body your genetics

3064.559 --> 3068.8
that's the thing you're gonna sacrifice

3067.28 --> 3071.6800000000003
for the dream

3068.8 --> 3072.7200000000003
and to keep believing that it's all

3071.68 --> 3076.0
right

3072.72 --> 3076.0
that's the sacrifice

3077.359 --> 3080.96
and some will literally just drop

3079.359 --> 3082.88
physically dead

3080.96 --> 3085.68
so in that sense it's a literal

3082.88 --> 3085.6800000000003
sacrifice

3086.0 --> 3089.92
but not for everybody but there is also

3088.319 --> 3094.5589999999997
a long-term sacrifice

3089.92 --> 3098.559
nobody that takes it gets away scot-free

3094.559 --> 3101.76
not a single person everybody gets

3098.559 --> 3104.0
something yeah even if it's a little

3101.76 --> 3111.8390000000004
thing everybody gets something

3104.0 --> 3111.839
if you take this

3136.839 --> 3139.839
oh

3149.839 --> 3154.4
select few get saline water oh really

3154.8 --> 3161.119
well that would be nice to think that

3157.92 --> 3161.92
i suggested that has anybody ever had

3161.119 --> 3165.28
any

3161.92 --> 3166.0
confirmation that that's real is any

3165.28 --> 3169.119
doctor ever

3166.0 --> 3170.72
said like yeah i've given some of my

3169.119 --> 3172.96
patients

3170.72 --> 3174.9599999999996
placebos and they knew about it or they

3172.96 --> 3178.64
didn't know about it

3174.96 --> 3182.88
right but yeah they'd get in trouble so

3178.64 --> 3184.96
i think the system

3182.88 --> 3188.4
the vaccine conspirators would try to

3184.96 --> 3188.4
crack down on such a doctor

3189.839 --> 3199.2
so has anybody ever the individual

3193.52 --> 3199.2
taken a placebo where they knew that

3199.76 --> 3205.0400000000004
would you admit it would you admit it

3202.48 --> 3209.839
anonymously i don't know

3205.04 --> 3209.839
that's yeah

3210.72 --> 3216.5589999999997
all i can say about is yeah i hope that

3212.96 --> 3219.92
a whole bunch of people got away

3216.559 --> 3219.92
by taking placebos

3221.119 --> 3227.76
i can't say that i have proof

3224.559 --> 3232.2400000000002
that they have though

3227.76 --> 3232.2400000000002
that anybody has i don't know

3234.72 --> 3239.52
world leaders they say oh yeah sure well

3237.52 --> 3241.68
do you have conclusive evidence of that

3239.52 --> 3244.64
have they admitted it in some brazen

3241.68 --> 3246.5589999999997
mood at some point

3244.64 --> 3248.72
or in some back room talk that was

3246.559 --> 3250.7200000000003
recorded is there proof of it

3248.72 --> 3252.16
or is it just like yeah of course they

3250.72 --> 3254.319
wouldn't take the real thing

3252.16 --> 3255.839
they know what it is yeah yeah everybody

3254.319 --> 3265.839
has that conclusion

3255.839 --> 3265.839
where's the actual proof though

3267.52 --> 3274.16
because i think that a lot of people

3270.64 --> 3277.2
truly underestimate how unbelievably

3274.16 --> 3278.64
stupid some of these world leaders

3277.2 --> 3281.68
really are

3278.64 --> 3284.24
right yeah they have connections

3281.68 --> 3286.0
yeah they realize that they are playing

3284.24 --> 3288.8799999999997
with things and that they have power

3286.0 --> 3289.52
does that mean that they actually have

3288.88 --> 3293.04
true

3289.52 --> 3297.359
inside of their situation

3293.04 --> 3300.96
you'd be surprised these people can get

3297.359 --> 3304.16
manic corrupted by their power

3300.96 --> 3306.4
and think that they are gods

3304.16 --> 3308.5589999999997
and guess what like just like in the

3306.4 --> 3313.92
movies is sometimes

3308.559 --> 3317.599
shown you get delusions of grandeur

3313.92 --> 3319.28
and then you just set yourself on fire

3317.599 --> 3320.0
because you think you're immortal or you

3319.28 --> 3323.52
just take that

3320.0 --> 3326.88
vaccine because you think yeah i am

3323.52 --> 3329.359
i am but more than that i can do it

3326.88 --> 3330.6400000000003
right that also happens do not

3329.359 --> 3333.839
underestimate how

3330.64 --> 3334.72
stupid some of these world leaders can

3333.839 --> 3337.7599999999998
get

3334.72 --> 3342.16
don't underestimate that they're often

3337.76 --> 3344.7990000000004
fully submerged in their dream

3342.16 --> 3346.64
in the dream that they help conjure like

3344.799 --> 3349.04
and they don't even realize that

3346.64 --> 3350.799
they're so drunk on it they don't even

3349.04 --> 3363.839
realize

3350.799 --> 3363.839
that it's a lie anymore they forget

3364.48 --> 3367.52
how do we know i haven't gotten the

3366.079 --> 3370.6400000000003
vaccine well i guess we'd have to

3367.52 --> 3372.96
genetically test that

3370.64 --> 3377.839
i'd have to do a blood sample and see if

3372.96 --> 3377.839
there's spike proteins in there

3378.079 --> 3384.1600000000003
it's a freaky idea

3381.359 --> 3384.16
but yeah

3384.72 --> 3392.3999999999996
i'm can absolutely guarantee that i've

3387.44 --> 3392.4
not had a freaking jab

3392.72 --> 3395.359
recently

3397.52 --> 3403.28
i can absolutely exclude that from the

3400.4 --> 3405.599
possibility of happening for at least 15

3403.28 --> 3410.1600000000003
years

3405.599 --> 3419.839
aft before that freaky [ __ ] happened

3410.16 --> 3419.839
and i don't know for sure

3428.03 --> 3431.139
[Music]

3442.319 --> 3445.359
she pulled normies who are worshipping

3444.48 --> 3449.119
armies or

3445.359 --> 3451.839
psychopath politician

3449.119 --> 3451.839
in control

3452.24 --> 3456.24
i think that they pretty much deserve

3454.0 --> 3460.48
each other

3456.24 --> 3461.1189999999997
you know i mean if the hell gates would

3460.48 --> 3466.0
open up

3461.119 --> 3469.92
they'd probably just go in together

3466.0 --> 3473.44
and live yeah what they

3469.92 --> 3476.559
live or die or go through hell together

3473.44 --> 3476.559
they deserve each other

3477.28 --> 3480.799
if you're that stupid

3481.44 --> 3485.04
then you deserve somebody that stupid

3483.839 --> 3489.839
that's going to tell

3485.04 --> 3489.839
you lies

3500.839 --> 3503.839
so

3504.64 --> 3509.2799999999997
all right so in that sense i think that

3506.799 --> 3512.559
president biden

3509.28 --> 3515.8390000000004
president maiden yeah

3512.559 --> 3516.559
i think that he's probably the most

3515.839 --> 3519.599
suitable

3516.559 --> 3521.44
president for the united states right

3519.599 --> 3524.799
now

3521.44 --> 3527.04
because of yeah because of his

3524.799 --> 3529.359
mental capacities i think it's a very

3527.04 --> 3533.359
good average representation of what's

3529.359 --> 3533.359
going what's going down in the u.s

3534.64 --> 3545.839
i think he's a pretty accurate

3536.24 --> 3545.839
representative wouldn't you say

3556.839 --> 3559.839
so

3570.839 --> 3573.839
alright

3587.44 --> 3601.839
all right jedo indeed

3604.559 --> 3609.8390000000004
why do globetarts deny the slaves well

3607.2 --> 3613.04
why do

3609.839 --> 3614.24
slaves deny they're enslaved maybe

3613.04 --> 3617.359
because

3614.24 --> 3620.64
it's easier to be a slave and deny it

3617.359 --> 3620.64
than to get out of it

3620.799 --> 3629.839
that's why it's that simple

3643.68 --> 3647.5989999999997
right yeah that's cur that's correct

3645.28 --> 3651.88
cleary they do they cry

3647.599 --> 3654.48
try to create an exemplary culture as in

3651.88 --> 3655.44
advertisements and even theories and all

3654.48 --> 3659.68
that

3655.44 --> 3662.64
they show you what they want you

3659.68 --> 3664.16
to dream about and to compare yourself

3662.64 --> 3667.44
with

3664.16 --> 3670.16
as to normalize it so they give you the

3667.44 --> 3672.4
examples of what they want you to live

3670.16 --> 3672.3999999999996
like

3673.76 --> 3676.0
right

3677.2 --> 3682.0789999999997
and it works for a lot of people a lot

3678.72 --> 3685.839
of people are completely drifting

3682.079 --> 3690.1600000000003
they are like parrots on many levels

3685.839 --> 3692.4
right they don't have stable parents

3690.16 --> 3694.48
or people like their parents are in the

3692.4 --> 3696.96
same issue they just become like

3694.48 --> 3698.799
in a fashion animalistic and they just

3696.96 --> 3701.359
don't know how to compose

3698.799 --> 3702.0
anything about themselves so they just

3701.359 --> 3705.359
try to

3702.0 --> 3707.599
copy from oh this oh everybody's seen

3705.359 --> 3710.88
this on tv so that

3707.599 --> 3711.3590000000004
must like give you a feeling that it's

3710.88 --> 3714.319
okay

3711.359 --> 3716.72
so i'll act like this right yeah there's

3714.319 --> 3720.319
a whole bunch of people

3716.72 --> 3723.7599999999998
generations people living like that

3720.319 --> 3723.7599999999998
especially in big cities

3725.359 --> 3729.2799999999997
they're just mimickers really they they

3727.839 --> 3733.52
act

3729.28 --> 3736.559
what they think people

3733.52 --> 3739.839
will not be discouraged about

3736.559 --> 3742.48
when they see it so they're just acting

3739.839 --> 3744.48
in a way like oh yeah we fit in oh

3742.48 --> 3747.92
that's okay

3744.48 --> 3750.079
and then beyond that they barely have

3747.92 --> 3751.92
any grip they don't really know who they

3750.079 --> 3753.8390000000004
are they don't know

3751.92 --> 3755.6800000000003
what to do with the world really they

3753.839 --> 3756.5589999999997
don't know how to change anything they

3755.68 --> 3761.2
don't even know

3756.559 --> 3761.2000000000003
often how to express inner anguish

3762.4 --> 3766.1600000000003
so they end up on pharmaceuticals

3766.88 --> 3770.6400000000003
most of people that don't know what to

3768.96 --> 3773.119
do with society don't know

3770.64 --> 3775.0389999999998
to have any proper composure based on

3773.119 --> 3777.599
their inner roots

3775.039 --> 3780.0
they don't have any family they end up

3777.599 --> 3781.599
on pharmaceuticals and then either dying

3780.0 --> 3784.799
of cancers

3781.599 --> 3787.28
or co-morbidities some kind you know how

3784.799 --> 3787.28
it happens

3797.76 --> 3803.119
yeah thank you tom stop whining or i'm

3800.48 --> 3803.119
blocking you

3804.0 --> 3808.799

you're here for is to complain about

3808.799 --> 3813.359

3810.0 --> 3818.24

so

3964.16 --> 3967.0389999999998
all right sorry guys

3967.599 --> 3979.839
it took a little longer

4003.76 --> 4007.8390000000004
what are you talking about

4022.0 --> 4027.839
something's gonna happen july 9th

4025.599 --> 4027.839
why

4028.799 --> 4033.7599999999998
i mean something's going to happen

4030.4 --> 4033.76
pretty much every week

4033.92 --> 4038.4
why what's so special about july 9th

4047.039 --> 4049.8390000000004
okay

4074.839 --> 4077.839
um

4084.72 --> 4092.24
wow agm okay

4088.4 --> 4095.359
well if you think that's worth it buddy

4092.24 --> 4097.44
if you like to watch mainstream media

4095.359 --> 4100.4
news broadcasters

4097.44 --> 4101.12
for clues if you want to go through all

4100.4 --> 4105.12
that

4101.12 --> 4109.92
just to get the clues okay

4105.12 --> 4112.96
you do that i am not going to do that

4109.92 --> 4119.839
because i

4112.96 --> 4119.839
rather stab my eyes out

4126.319 --> 4130.799
i mean it doesn't mean that like i might

4129.12 --> 4131.599999999999
pick up on a clip here and there it's

4130.799 --> 4135.759
just like

4131.6 --> 4138.719
really you're gonna watch actively watch

4135.759 --> 4139.44
for like more than 30 seconds actively

4138.719 --> 4144.719
watch

4139.44 --> 4144.719
like cnn it's like really

4144.839 --> 4152.0
dude i don't know how you can do it man

4148.4 --> 4152.0
i don't know how you can do it

4153.359 --> 4157.6
maybe you have some special immunity to

4155.92 --> 4161.839
that level of stupid

4157.6 --> 4161.839
i i don't know how you do it

4167.279 --> 4170.88
and to me that's like watching gay porn

4170.239 --> 4173.919999999999
it's like

4170.88 --> 4176.08
yeah after just a few seconds i am going

4173.92 --> 4177.6
to start vomiting if i don't turn that

4176.08 --> 4189.839
off

4177.6 --> 4189.839
you know

4191.92 --> 4195.6
whatever i say after one second

4199.28 --> 4204.719
if i don't know watch them you will

4201.04 --> 4204.719
never know what yeah you will

4205.04 --> 4213.36
yeah you will they echo through anything

4210.08 --> 4215.12
how can you get away from picking up

4213.36 --> 4216.799999999999
on what they're up to how can you get

4215.12 --> 4231.84
away from that agm

4216.8 --> 4231.84
you can't get away from it

4233.96 --> 4237.079
[Music]

4238.8 --> 4245.84
yo yo magu i have no idea who that is

4242.719 --> 4245.84
hey jim

4254.08 --> 4260.32
but i i don't really understand why what

4256.96 --> 4260.32
i would get out of it

4261.52 --> 4270.159000000001
oh jojo magu okay that's blyden okay

4266.8 --> 4272.2390000000005
yeah but his press briefings are that's

4270.159 --> 4274.08
comedy value

4272.239 --> 4276.239
that's not like oh you're going to pick

4274.08 --> 4279.199
up on really important data

4276.239 --> 4280.08
really widen press conference that's

4279.199 --> 4282.969999999999
where you're going to

4280.08 --> 4285.36
pick up important data

4282.97 --> 4287.84
[Music]

4285.36 --> 4287.839999999999
how is that

4288.96 --> 4291.12
i

4299.199 --> 4303.44
i think that like the gamma king news

4301.6 --> 4308.08
readers probably have more

4303.44 --> 4311.678999999999
sneaky tricks that are going to echo on

4308.08 --> 4314.48
than like yeah

4311.679 --> 4315.1990000000005
demented cases like biden you know like

4314.48 --> 4319.5199999999995
how

4315.199 --> 4320.0
what could he do can barely concentrate

4319.52 --> 4329.84
man

4320.0 --> 4329.84
this is

4334.0 --> 4338.56
yeah but atm that's only because of

4336.239 --> 4340.639999999999
standard it's just standard policy

4338.56 --> 4342.56
like yeah oh you're lost you don't have

4340.64 --> 4345.360000000001
any plan okay just

4342.56 --> 4347.6
do the standard [ __ ] just more rainbow

4345.36 --> 4350.719
flags

4347.6 --> 4352.96
more [ __ ] storytelling hour more

4350.719 --> 4356.2390000000005
just that's just because he doesn't

4352.96 --> 4358.64
really know what else to do you know you

4356.239 --> 4358.639999999999
gotta do

4368.84 --> 4371.84
something

4374.56 --> 4385.84
yeah i know right ralph rodriguez is

4384.08 --> 4388.4
i already caught that a lot of people

4385.84 --> 4390.08
did but even like before he supposedly

4388.4 --> 4390.879999999999
became president i already said like

4390.08 --> 4393.5199999999995
dude that

4390.88 --> 4395.1990000000005
guy is really ready for retirement i

4393.52 --> 4399.84
can't believe they're gonna force him to

4395.199 --> 4399.839999999999
do that [ __ ]

4424.84 --> 4427.84
so

4435.12 --> 4444.8
look again dude if you want to be

4440.239 --> 4447.599999999999
a mainstream news analyst

4444.8 --> 4449.28
i'm not stopping you there is some value

4447.6 --> 4452.400000000001
to it i'm just saying

4449.28 --> 4452.4
i wouldn't do that

4452.56 --> 4460.4800000000005
if i or you but that's because

4456.4 --> 4462.639999999999
i am me if you say that

4460.48 --> 4463.599999999999
you can get some functionality out of it

4462.64 --> 4465.6
without

4463.6 --> 4467.120000000001
literally losing your mind in the

4465.6 --> 4470.320000000001
process

4467.12 --> 4473.36
then you do have risks to that you have

4470.32 --> 4478.48
to admit that agm you uh

4473.36 --> 4478.48
so be careful with it don't

4479.12 --> 4482.8
don't drive yourself over any edges

4481.199 --> 4484.159
again

4482.8 --> 4485.84
but yeah hey if you want to be a

4484.159 --> 4489.36
mainstream output

4485.84 --> 4493.04
analyst then yeah sure dude

4489.36 --> 4495.12
like in a way if you can do it without

4493.04 --> 4496.32
going insane then i am happy that you

4495.12 --> 4499.92
would do it

4496.32 --> 4501.679
especially because yeah i know you

4499.92 --> 4503.1990000000005
might have some interesting feedback

4501.679 --> 4506.32
because of it

4503.199 --> 4506.32
and at least i

4506.4 --> 4510.5599999999995
will have to do it even less

4512.239 --> 4516.08
and that is a good thing to me so

4516.39 --> 4520.8
[Music]

4517.679 --> 4521.28
why i watch great people who do break

4520.8 --> 4523.1990000000005
down

4521.28 --> 4539.84
mainstream media yeah that's right and

4523.199 --> 4539.839999999999
there's some really good ones out there

4540.8 --> 4545.04
you just gotta have a really good

4542.56 --> 4547.76
compass you gotta you really know

4545.04 --> 4547.76
what's real

4548.719 --> 4553.76
gotta be very focused or it's just gonna

4551.12 --> 4556.0
blur up again

4553.76 --> 4558.159000000001
that's what they do that's why they do

4556.0 --> 4561.44
it to blur you up

4558.159 --> 4561.839999999999
so just convolute [ __ ] make it all so

4561.44 --> 4564.719
dis

4561.84 --> 4564.719
disjointed

4564.88 --> 4571.6
and impulsive that you

4568.08 --> 4573.04
lose control even if you didn't watch it

4571.6 --> 4576.400000000001
because you believed it

4573.04 --> 4581.84
right it's like a hypnotic side effect

4576.4 --> 4581.839999999999
of it all that's what they do

4582.719 --> 4589.36
and it also by the way rubs off on them

4586.0 --> 4594.84
on themselves that also happens right i

4589.36 --> 4597.999
already explained this

4594.84 --> 4597.999
[Music]

4600.4 --> 4602.719
hmm

4603.6 --> 4609.84
hey still in 80 12 yeah i'm doing great

4637.199 --> 4640.5599999999995
right yeah and yeah though in that sense

4639.84 --> 4643.84
you watch

4640.56 --> 4645.6
people who break down mainstream media

4643.84 --> 4649.04
so then you have to watch it

4645.6 --> 4652.4800000000005
well i have a similar habit with movies

4649.04 --> 4654.88
because like

4652.48 --> 4656.36
good movies i like you know of course

4654.88 --> 4660.719
but there's also

4656.36 --> 4663.599999999999
really really terrible movies

4660.719 --> 4666.0
i absolutely don't want to watch but i

4663.6 --> 4667.6
am kind of fascinated with him

4666.0 --> 4669.44
and there's a whole bunch of people out

4667.6 --> 4672.320000000001
there on the internet that actually

4669.44 --> 4674.159
review those really really bad movies

4672.32 --> 4678.4
and give a halfway decent

4674.159 --> 4681.44
or at least funny analysis of them

4678.4 --> 4685.679
right and so i've learned a lot about

4681.44 --> 4689.5199999999995
problems and notoriously bad movies

4685.679 --> 4690.4800000000005
through reviewers when if i'd actually

4689.52 --> 4693.120000000001
had to

4690.48 --> 4694.959999999999
just watch those movies i just got a

4693.12 --> 4696.8
headache and then probably would forget

4694.96 --> 4700.0
about them

4696.8 --> 4703.28
right so yeah there is something to say

4700.0 --> 4707.84
for people that like to analyze

4703.28 --> 4707.84
terrible things

4732.8 --> 4736.08
come out in the open

4736.32 --> 4741.92
uh how how would that be possible

4739.36 --> 4742.799999999999
it's already out in the open it's just

4741.92 --> 4745.84
being

4742.8 --> 4749.1990000000005
snowed under by financial power

4745.84 --> 4751.52
through mainstream lies right

4749.199 --> 4753.919999999999
all the big truths and all it's already

4751.52 --> 4756.2390000000005
out in the open it's just being snowed

4753.92 --> 4756.2390000000005
under

4760.719 --> 4764.719
they make you dig for it but it's

4763.04 --> 4767.84
already out in the open

4764.719 --> 4767.84
terra 306

4769.44 --> 4777.839999999999
hey tony sleeping warrior dominoid also

4788.88 --> 4792.56
yeah here we go again look there's a

4790.8 --> 4795.84
game going on okay

4792.56 --> 4799.04
this is how the down votes work

4795.84 --> 4799.92
there's people or maybe not even people

4799.04 --> 4803.36
maybe it's

4799.92 --> 4806.56
literally just word detection bots

4803.36 --> 4807.839999999999
and they specifically have a whole scale

4806.56 --> 4811.120000000001
of things

4807.84 --> 4814.08
words no no words and they literally

4811.12 --> 4817.5199999999995
pick up on what am i gonna talk about

4814.08 --> 4821.44
if i take a bad subject i get down votes

4817.52 --> 4822.2390000000005
automatically so it's just a summing up

4821.44 --> 4825.28
of

4822.239 --> 4828.32
how bad our win was today

4825.28 --> 4832.159
for bringing up what they

4828.32 --> 4833.599999999999
whoever they are consider no no subjects

4832.159 --> 4835.28
and they're very persistent and

4833.6 --> 4838.320000000001
systematic about it so they're

4835.28 --> 4839.44
literally trying to condition me like

4838.32 --> 4840.96
i'm a horse

4839.44 --> 4843.04
and they're trying to write me that's

4840.96 --> 4846.2390000000005
what they attempt it's that's how

4843.04 --> 4847.28
[ __ ] arrogant these scumbag pieces of

4846.239 --> 4851.36
[ __ ]

4847.28 --> 4851.36
manipulating ninis are

4854.719 --> 4861.52
really disgusting wannabe

4858.84 --> 4865.6
parasitic social engineer

4861.52 --> 4868.56
wannabes disgusting

4865.6 --> 4869.92
worthless they have nothing they don't

4868.56 --> 4874.400000000001
have a life they have

4869.92 --> 4876.159
nothing of themselves just [ __ ]

4874.4 --> 4877.5199999999995
that's why they end up doing this kind

4876.159 --> 4879.44
of garbage

4877.52 --> 4882.719
they think that the entire world is

4879.44 --> 4888.719
their private social engineering project

4882.719 --> 4891.52
whoever they latch onto for that purpose

4888.719 --> 4894.159
yeah it's not working i'm not even gonna

4891.52 --> 4894.159000000001
hide it

4896.96 --> 4904.08
it's right there everybody to see

4900.159 --> 4906.719
to see it unfold every show

4904.08 --> 4908.5599999999995
because the more subjects more no-no

4906.719 --> 4910.8
subjects

4908.56 --> 4911.76
i bring up the more down votes get

4910.8 --> 4913.6
rolled in

4911.76 --> 4915.84
and by the way they already roll in as

4913.6 --> 4917.04
this show starts up you know i usually

4915.84 --> 4922.2390000000005
start out with like

4917.04 --> 4924.639
six down votes for i've even went live

4922.239 --> 4926.638999999999
which is i don't know how that's even

4924.639 --> 4929.1990000000005
technically possible

4926.639 --> 4931.04
because it's not like the show is

4929.199 --> 4933.12
announced it's literally click

4931.04 --> 4934.96
i go live so there's not like oh it's

4933.12 --> 4937.679
gonna go live in half an hour

4934.96 --> 4938.56
because then you could vote no it's

4937.679 --> 4941.1990000000005
click

4938.56 --> 4941.679
i am live right now i quickly go to the

4941.199 --> 4944.96
page

4941.679 --> 4946.8
live and guess what six down votes

4944.96 --> 4948.8
yeah i don't even know how that's

4946.8 --> 4952.719
technically possible

4948.8 --> 4953.4400000000005
okay i don't but it doesn't really

4952.719 --> 4958.639
matter

4953.44 --> 4962.159
it's all just social engineering nining

4958.639 --> 4966.159000000001
like parasites trying to weigh you down

4962.159 --> 4966.159
with their disease and sloth

4966.639 --> 4973.84
it's not working

4984.84 --> 4987.84
do

5025.28 --> 5029.44
right yeah i don't know man like what

5028.239 --> 5032.4
does the free

5029.44 --> 5033.12
in freemason even stand for is it free

5032.4 --> 5036.159
as in

5033.12 --> 5038.08
liberal mason is that what it

5036.159 --> 5039.759999999999
actually stands for is that what the

5038.08 --> 5044.8
free

5039.76 --> 5047.1990000000005
is representing liberal

5044.8 --> 5048.08
which of course esoterically deep

5047.199 --> 5051.5199999999995
underneath

5048.08 --> 5054.639
actually means freedom from god right

5051.52 --> 5054.639
that's the strife

5054.96 --> 5058.32
liberation from god

5062.239 --> 5069.599999999999
from logos from the yeah

5065.76 --> 5070.0
the logical conclusion of how to do

5069.6 --> 5072.88
things

5070.0 --> 5073.36
based on the design that god made right

5072.88 --> 5074.8
that's

5073.36 --> 5076.719
that's what they want to escape from

5074.8 --> 5079.679
that's what they want liberation from

5076.719 --> 5081.52
that's what they want freedom from

5079.679 --> 5099.84
is that why it's called freemason i

5081.52 --> 5099.84
don't know but i wouldn't be surprised

5106.88 --> 5112.8
okay well agm yeah that seems logical

5110.8 --> 5115.360000000001
i don't know though i don't know where

5112.8 --> 5115.360000000001
the free

5115.52 --> 5123.92
like literally historically comes from

5120.4 --> 5124.638999999999
in freemason was it like a nickname they

5123.92 --> 5127.84
were just

5124.639 --> 5127.84
named freemase i don't know

5130.719 --> 5134.2390000000005
it got preferred in the long of course

5132.639 --> 5135.92
it did

5134.239 --> 5138.159
you know what i learned from the

5135.92 --> 5141.12
freemasons

5138.159 --> 5142.28
or what i heard is that very early they

5141.12 --> 5145.679
were basically a

5142.28 --> 5145.679
counter-catholic movement

5145.92 --> 5152.88
to preserve knowledge and well freedom

5149.44 --> 5156.5599999999995
right but in this case not freedom from

5152.88 --> 5160.32
god's design but freedom from the

5156.56 --> 5160.320000000001
tyrannical priestly rule

5160.719 --> 5167.6
from man freedom from man posing as god

5164.96 --> 5168.4800000000005
right that that's what i originally

5167.6 --> 5171.6
learned

5168.48 --> 5174.4
i since learned of course there's a

5171.6 --> 5176.88
whole bunch of convolution [ __ ]

5174.4 --> 5178.08
happening ever since and that there's a

5176.88 --> 5179.6
lot wrong

5178.08 --> 5182.0
but that's what i heard that is

5179.6 --> 5197.84
originally that

5182.0 --> 5197.84
or like like a truth movement yes

5197.92 --> 5202.96
earth no house g

5208.84 --> 5211.84
no

5213.44 --> 5218.799999999999
uh yeah ralph rodriguez

5216.639 --> 5220.96
yeah yeah you should especially if

5218.8 --> 5222.639
they're wearing it in the open

5220.96 --> 5224.8
that means they're either in some kind

5222.639 --> 5239.84
of a function or they're proud of it

5224.8 --> 5239.84
in either way i'd be careful

5242.96 --> 5253.84
okay what i'm hearing now is definitely

5245.04 --> 5253.84
not coming from inside

5264.84 --> 5270.8
machine

5266.719 --> 5270.8
it's like either window cleaners or

5271.92 --> 5281.84
yeah it's probably window cleaners right

5273.76 --> 5281.84
that's what i'm hearing right now

5311.6 --> 5313.92
hmm

5315.12 --> 5318.719
okay that's by the way an interesting

5317.12 --> 5323.28
way to say that

5318.719 --> 5326.56
slave mason that

5323.28 --> 5327.599999999999
right if you say freemason and you

5326.56 --> 5331.04
actually

5327.6 --> 5334.08
regard it as a reversed world

5331.04 --> 5337.679
lie then take it just like pure satanic

5334.08 --> 5340.0
yeah then it would be a slave mason

5337.679 --> 5342.32
then the freedom is actually reversed

5340.0 --> 5342.32
world

5342.56 --> 5346.400000000001
i hadn't thought of it like that before

5346.56 --> 5354.0
but then again hey the reversed world

5350.719 --> 5357.36
always slips into anything

5354.0 --> 5360.639
and then literally creates the opposite

5357.36 --> 5362.5599999999995
of what it is within that's what they do

5360.639 --> 5364.159000000001
that's the seed of evil

5362.56 --> 5366.0
they get in everything it's the

5364.159 --> 5369.199
grapplers it's what they do

5366.0 --> 5371.28
they get in something in a movement

5369.199 --> 5373.36
then they take it over partially or

5371.28 --> 5376.8
completely then they create

5373.36 --> 5380.08
the exact opposite of the movement

5376.8 --> 5384.639
on the core of the inside of it

5380.08 --> 5393.84
they do it with everything everything

5384.639 --> 5393.84
that's what they do it's a system

5401.92 --> 5407.84
free and accepted mason

5405.04 --> 5407.84
okay

5413.04 --> 5417.12
why accept it why

5419.76 --> 5435.84
what does acceptance has to do

5423.199 --> 5435.839999999999
what does that have to do with it

5438.08 --> 5445.12
so they were like a guilt not

5441.44 --> 5446.719
bound to a lord right not medieval times

5445.12 --> 5450.48
right so they were not bound to

5446.719 --> 5454.0
the church or to a king

5450.48 --> 5454.0
they were like a guild

5457.36 --> 5461.599999999999
well that that would explain the origins

5461.679 --> 5477.84
so the freedom did stand for freedom of

5465.44 --> 5477.839999999999
being ruled over at first

5482.8 --> 5486.159000000001
yeah lodge yeah they didn't have a lord

5484.719 --> 5491.84
they had a lodge

5486.159 --> 5491.839999999999
okay hmm

5544.84 --> 5547.84
what

5562.4 --> 5567.839999999999
perhaps i i don't know what you are

5564.56 --> 5570.0
talking about gaining wisdom but

5567.84 --> 5572.159000000001
i don't remember having seen that sort

5570.0 --> 5575.44
of symbolism

5572.159 --> 5589.839999999999
i don't know what a

5575.44 --> 5589.839999999999
what it has to do with bail

5596.639 --> 5600.4800000000005
well tera306 have you ever considered

5599.199 --> 5602.5599999999995
that

5600.48 --> 5604.718999999999
maybe it's just none of our [ __ ]

5602.56 --> 5605.52
business how many people get to live on

5604.719 --> 5608.719
this planet

5605.52 --> 5612.4800000000005
the child on this planet

5608.719 --> 5615.28
look what i just said wow

5612.48 --> 5615.28
in this realm

5615.6 --> 5622.2390000000005
right because have you ever considered

5619.44 --> 5622.239
that simply

5622.56 --> 5626.159000000001
like just the collective spirit of

5625.52 --> 5628.4800000000005
people

5626.159 --> 5630.08
not the one program but just the one

5628.48 --> 5632.718999999999
that actually arrives

5630.08 --> 5634.08
through the spirit through god's input

5632.719 --> 5637.04
will just determine

5634.08 --> 5639.199
exactly what it's like to be with as

5637.04 --> 5642.32
many people as there are

5639.199 --> 5646.239
and that the amount will even cause

5642.32 --> 5649.84
the way people are to change

5646.239 --> 5651.678999999999
so who why

5649.84 --> 5654.96
would you think that it's some kind of

5651.679 --> 5654.96
numerical game

5657.44 --> 5663.12
that there's a specific amount no

5660.88 --> 5664.08
it's any amount any amount but the

5663.12 --> 5667.679
amount will

5664.08 --> 5673.84
change everything it changes how

5667.679 --> 5673.84
everybody is eventually i think

5696.159 --> 5701.839999999999
no sleeping warrior it's all pointless

5702.719 --> 5707.92
birth what birth control how about

5705.44 --> 5711.678999999999
freaking cultural control how about

5707.92 --> 5714.4800000000005
stop making everybody

5711.679 --> 5715.6
into sex addicts how about that how

5714.48 --> 5719.199
about

5715.6 --> 5723.04
stopping commercial

5719.199 --> 5725.678999999999
systems to literally mind control

5723.04 --> 5727.36
everybody into becoming sex addicts just

5725.679 --> 5732.639
so they could sell a product

5727.36 --> 5735.199
how about that yeah if you do that

5732.639 --> 5737.119
then i don't see the issue there

5735.199 --> 5738.4
wouldn't be need to be birth control

5737.119 --> 5744.48
people would just

5738.4 --> 5744.48
procreate and be a little bit more

5754.84 --> 5757.84
productive

5771.44 --> 5775.759999999999
now raffle 3 i said plan because that's

5774.08 --> 5778.4
an echo that's an echo of

5775.76 --> 5780.08
a lot of people making such a statement

5778.4 --> 5782.239
and saying it in that fashion

5780.08 --> 5783.28
and it just rolled out like that by

5782.239 --> 5787.919999999999
accident because

5783.28 --> 5787.92
a lot of people say it like that it's

5796.84 --> 5799.84
just

5810.84 --> 5813.84
now

5824.84 --> 5830.06
uh

5826.88 --> 5830.06
[Music]

5838.84 --> 5841.84
uh

5852.84 --> 5855.84
what

5877.6 --> 5883.84
where are you getting it from rest at

5880.239 --> 5883.839999999999
what the

5884.32 --> 5891.679
i mean sure they're probably

5887.36 --> 5894.0
such a story but in the bible really

5891.679 --> 5894.0
uh

5895.76 --> 5911.84
i i highly doubt that

5920.08 --> 5929.679
it's in the bubble okay where

5924.96 --> 5929.679
where is it give us the verse

5936.84 --> 5939.84
huh

5950.84 --> 5953.84
so

5964.84 --> 5967.84
so

5972.0 --> 5975.92
wow 306 okay

5979.28 --> 5984.239
yeah although you know it's not really

5982.56 --> 5988.8
about

5984.239 --> 5988.799999999999
the living condition density

5989.52 --> 5993.040000000001
the main fear is that the humans will go

5992.32 --> 5995.679
through

5993.04 --> 5997.44
all the resources that's really the main

5995.679 --> 5999.6
fear it's literally

5997.44 --> 6000.719
my nine i want it oh it's all gonna go

5999.6 --> 6003.84
away

6000.719 --> 6006.639
humans are gonna steal my resources

6003.84 --> 6008.32
right that's what it's really about it's

6006.639 --> 6012.32
not about how many people

6008.32 --> 6012.639
fit on the surface it's all about my my

6012.32 --> 6016.239
my

6012.639 --> 6017.1990000000005
my resources mine mine that's what it's

6016.239 --> 6020.239
really about

6017.199 --> 6026.159
it's just about greedy pieces of [ __ ]

6020.239 --> 6026.159
that don't really know how this world is

6034.84 --> 6037.84
designed

6038.88 --> 6041.119
right

6041.92 --> 6048.8
like they literally don't seem to

6044.4 --> 6048.799999999999
understand the nature of this physical

6048.84 --> 6054.4800000000005
realm

6050.4 --> 6057.5199999999995
like scarcity panicky

6054.48 --> 6060.879999999999
greedy people have been around for a

6057.52 --> 6066.159000000001
long freaking time they're always

6060.88 --> 6069.1990000000005
insane like always they're always insane

6066.159 --> 6071.28
like they have no proper balance they

6069.199 --> 6076.839999999999
have no proper response they're just

6071.28 --> 6079.84
locked in some freaky delusional

6076.84 --> 6079.84
paranoia

6080.88 --> 6094.88
it's a figure of speech what

6092.4 --> 6094.879999999999
what

6099.6 --> 6103.1990000000005
what is a figure of speech

6104.56 --> 6108.96
is it a figure of speech who's doing the

6106.719 --> 6111.679
figuring of speeching

6108.96 --> 6111.679
good servant

6112.32 --> 6121.84
who is describing it

6137.119 --> 6142.4
dude just just the name it's like i

6140.56 --> 6148.320000000001
don't even have to read you it's

6142.4 --> 6151.92
just the name like

6148.32 --> 6155.5199999999995
no it's not rubbing off

6151.92 --> 6158.8
you can't just insert shitty things

6155.52 --> 6162.400000000001
you want to have rubbed off on me

6158.8 --> 6165.84
it doesn't work it's just you

6162.4 --> 6168.879999999999
you are the fubar

6165.84 --> 6171.92
you are the literal third icon

6168.88 --> 6175.6
guy you are the one

6171.92 --> 6178.4
naming yourself after literal

6175.6 --> 6178.88
shitty things it's not gonna rub off

6178.4 --> 6191.28
it's

6178.88 --> 6205.679
just you

6191.28 --> 6219.84
hey adam can

6205.679 --> 6219.84
whatever it was it was

6226.8 --> 6234.159000000001
yeah it's figuring of speeches

6232.08 --> 6237.5199999999995
brilliance that's not that rude but it

6234.159 --> 6239.36
was really i do want to know now

6237.52 --> 6240.56
because rust had uh brought something

6239.36 --> 6242.4
that was weird

6240.56 --> 6247.04
and then good servant says it's just a

6242.4 --> 6249.28
figure of speech and i'm like what

6247.04 --> 6249.28
so

6254.48 --> 6260.0
i mean things like act 5 30

6258.08 --> 6262.4
i don't even freaking know what that

6260.0 --> 6262.4
means

6262.719 --> 6265.36
i'm not a

6265.92 --> 6270.08
you name me a number and then i know

6267.84 --> 6273.28
where to find it in the freaking bible

6270.08 --> 6276.719
i i'm not one of those i don't know

6273.28 --> 6281.679
i don't really care to know

6276.719 --> 6281.679
but i would like to know about this part

6285.84 --> 6294.639
yeah this channel is about banning

6289.44 --> 6294.638999999999
pieces of [ __ ] trolls ted

6294.8 --> 6302.0

6305.76 --> 6311.360000000001
my way

6307.44 --> 6311.36

6314.84 --> 6317.84

6326.96 --> 6330.08
the god of our fathers race of jesus

6329.6 --> 6345.84

6352.8 --> 6359.84
no i did not know that lift that's weird

6376.48 --> 6387.28
all right yeah i guess so rest that

6380.4 --> 6390.0

6387.28 --> 6391.199
but i'd like to read a deeper context of

6390.0 --> 6401.84

6679.92 --> 6683.4400000000005
even

6680.4 --> 6687.36
correlating to that it's just

6683.44 --> 6689.44
parts with big title names of apostles

6687.36 --> 6695.839999999999

hell

6706.84 --> 6709.84
okay

6710.0 --> 6716.48
i guess that's the thing

6713.04 --> 6720.8
i think i found acts

6716.48 --> 6723.839999999999
acts 5 30.

6720.8 --> 6727.92
thanks five

6723.84 --> 6727.92
i i just happened to stumble on it

6728.0 --> 6731.28
that's five

6731.36 --> 6734.639
thirty oh

6734.96 --> 6740.0
yeah see it's over here you could have

6737.04 --> 6741.92
said that like yeah that's at

6740.0 --> 6744.4
four-fifths of the book that would have

6741.92 --> 6744.4
helped

6745.04 --> 6752.239
okay it's

6748.48 --> 6752.239
fine 30.

6752.8 --> 6756.88
the god of our ancestors raised jesus

6755.92 --> 6765.84
from the dead

6756.88 --> 6765.84
after you killed him

6767.119 --> 6769.5199999999995
what

6777.679 --> 6784.2390000000005
okay but so peter and vaguely the

6780.96 --> 6784.2390000000005
apostles replied

6784.56 --> 6790.639
put him in the place of honor this

6787.84 --> 6790.639
right hand

6791.36 --> 6794.32
that's weird

6803.36 --> 6808.5599999999995
no it says by hanging him on the cross

6810.0 --> 6815.44
you want to see it so

6813.36 --> 6816.5599999999995
yeah i don't know which version you got

6815.44 --> 6819.04
but this one says

6816.56 --> 6821.84
on a cross don't know if you can see

6819.04 --> 6821.84
this

6823.44 --> 6829.199
ah no you can't see this it says

6826.88 --> 6831.1990000000005
you killed him by hanging him on a cross

6829.199 --> 6835.839999999999
so i don't know what version you got

6831.199 --> 6835.839999999999
that from

6839.76 --> 6845.76
no there's no mention of a tree

6843.44 --> 6846.5599999999995
but yeah i got the what is it again the

6845.76 --> 6849.360000000001
nlt

6846.56 --> 6851.599
version so i don't know where you got

6849.36 --> 6855.92
that from

6851.599 --> 6855.92
this one says just hang in front across

6857.04 --> 6861.28
but that's weird that some version might

6859.119 --> 6862.96
say hanging from the tree because then

6861.28 --> 6877.679
i'd say like okay

6862.96 --> 6881.119
what does that actually mean

6877.679 --> 6883.84
kjv says tree okay well i don't have a

6881.119 --> 6883.839999999999
kjv

6885.04 --> 6892.4
and king james version is weird

6888.56 --> 6892.400000000001
king james was a bit of a freak

6896.4 --> 6905.839999999999
and he had really really weird pants

6900.48 --> 6905.839999999999
if i remember correctly

6917.84 --> 6920.8
the old test

6926.719 --> 6933.84
did the apparatus oh yeah across

6931.36 --> 6934.639
a cross is made of wood and wood is made

6933.84 --> 6947.84
from a tree

6934.639 --> 6947.84
but i don't see that that like what

6956.719 --> 6962.4
okay right so anyway yeah

6960.159 --> 6966.0
whoa we've already passed three i'm

6962.4 --> 6966.0

6973.36 --> 6978.4

bible version

6983.36 --> 6989.598999999999
