explaining parables

291.5 --> 294.589
[Music]

295.52 --> 299.35999999999996
and then i think that nathan did a

297.6 --> 301.84000000000003
repeat premiere from

299.36 --> 302.96000000000004
what is it from another show i don't

301.84 --> 305.28
know when what was that

302.96 --> 306.08
was that like tuesday or wednesday with

305.28 --> 309.75899999999996
the sam

306.08 --> 312.639
guy god that lasted forever

309.759 --> 314.47900000000004
on so long it's just insane like two

312.639 --> 318.56
hours or something

314.479 --> 318.56
the same question oh god

323.68 --> 328.0
time change what time change

333.84 --> 338.0
my show is always 1 pm amsterdam time or

336.8 --> 342.479
it has been for

338.0 --> 342.479
for what is it almost half a year

345.36 --> 349.28000000000003
right oh my yeah almost anyway uh

349.44 --> 356.24
a tiny wumbo iron effie

352.639 --> 359.039
good to see you our time in the us

356.24 --> 361.52
oh oh that u.s time changed again oh

359.039 --> 364.88
yeah they always like to be

361.52 --> 368.0
ahead a period

364.88 --> 371.199
of europe so

368.0 --> 373.919
is it now even an hour earlier for you

371.199 --> 373.91900000000004
than normal

377.6 --> 395.84000000000003
or is it an hour later

381.44 --> 395.84
wait this is

396.4 --> 400.08
hello leaping4j

401.36 --> 404.88
right so i'm even earlier for you guys

403.36 --> 409.84000000000003
okay

404.88 --> 409.84
try to keep that in mind

418.08 --> 421.28
all right yeah i had another hey james

420.24 --> 423.759
mason

421.28 --> 425.67999999999995
good to see you yeah i had another long

423.759 --> 428.0
phone call with my friend over in

425.68 --> 432.72
america

428.0 --> 432.72
yesterday as well pretty much until

434.84 --> 437.84
midnight

440.96 --> 446.63899999999995
south park and that was it pretty much

444.319 --> 449.28000000000003
didn't really see any other no more of

446.639 --> 449.28000000000003
these streams

449.68 --> 456.8
took a short glimpse at globe busters

453.28 --> 459.28
well basically over at jaron's

456.8 --> 461.36
d live channel since i can still comment

459.28 --> 465.44
there

461.36 --> 468.47900000000004
and so that was kind of typical

465.44 --> 471.68
didn't hang around long

468.479 --> 475.44
because of well certain things that

471.68 --> 475.44
were just being said again and

475.68 --> 479.36
it's kind of ridiculous really i don't

477.919 --> 483.12
even want to

479.36 --> 483.12
try to paraphrase it or anything

490.08 --> 494.96
rumpus is immoral maybe

503.44 --> 507.84
i'm on later there now

509.36 --> 512.16
okay so i'm

516.959 --> 524.7189999999999
okay random that makes sense

521.68 --> 524.7189999999999
because since the

525.36 --> 532.72
the springtime is always moving the time

529.279 --> 535.4399999999999
backwards so the day time

532.72 --> 536.32
lasts longer into the evening so that

535.44 --> 539.6
makes sense

536.32 --> 540.08
if you switch first then i should be

539.6 --> 543.2
later

540.08 --> 549.839
before over here we switch an hour back

543.2 --> 549.839
in time as well

575.92 --> 582.56
right so yeah i chose the uh

579.04 --> 583.279
the title of the hangout i chose it

582.56 --> 585.4399999999999
yesterday

583.279 --> 586.399
i kind of wanted to do it before but i

585.44 --> 590.24
kind of forgot

586.399 --> 592.64
so i did it this time it's purely a

590.24 --> 594.08
referencing to that situation

592.64 --> 596.48
over at the flat earth debate with

594.08 --> 599.0400000000001
rumpus about the

596.48 --> 601.04
the the tangent point which he claimed

599.04 --> 604.8
doesn't require a tangent line

601.04 --> 607.92
which is yeah blatantly

604.8 --> 612.16
wrong it's ridiculous

607.92 --> 614.16
literally ignoring an antecedent

612.16 --> 616.079
so yeah that's why i titled it today

614.16 --> 618.48
show that

616.079 --> 619.519
i didn't necessarily want to go into

618.48 --> 623.279
that subject

619.519 --> 624.399
i thought that yeah an hour plus of that

623.279 --> 633.8389999999999
non-stop was

624.399 --> 633.839
probably enough for most of you this is

644.839 --> 649.519
hmm

647.36 --> 652.0
right a little detail yesterday was

649.519 --> 656.16
weird i noticed

652.0 --> 658.32
like this guy jet skeptic media came on

656.16 --> 659.68
and i addressed him in a way like oh i

658.32 --> 661.2
know what you did but

659.68 --> 664.0
that was really silly of me in

661.2 --> 666.24
retrospect because it wasn't him

664.0 --> 667.44
i mixed him up with somebody else so he

666.24 --> 669.92
was like what

667.44 --> 671.36
what did i do and so yeah sorry about

669.92 --> 675.12
that i kind of mixed you up

671.36 --> 678.72
sorry it happened sometimes

675.12 --> 678.72
there's so many people out there

679.839 --> 684.48
and if you're gonna have the name

681.2 --> 686.5600000000001
skeptic media in you then

684.48 --> 688.8000000000001
i don't know that's very those are very

686.56 --> 692.399
typical titles

688.8 --> 694.88
so i mixed it up right

692.399 --> 695.6
just chat skeptic didn't do nothing

694.88 --> 698.88
wrong

695.6 --> 698.88
as far as i can remember

700.839 --> 703.839
ah

707.68 --> 711.279
right so yeah i'm pretty much in an open

710.56 --> 714.4799999999999
book right now

711.279 --> 714.48
got we got another

714.56 --> 722.959
oh we're and 40 minutes to talk about

718.399 --> 731.839
any subject you guys and girls want

722.959 --> 731.8389999999999
flat earth related or otherwise

742.839 --> 745.839
so

752.72 --> 756.839
all right i've been reading some pretty

755.36 --> 761.6800000000001
good articles

756.839 --> 761.6800000000001
uh from the netherlands

762.959 --> 766.959
it seems like there was this one article

766.48 --> 770.839
about

766.959 --> 773.5999999999999
cops being

770.839 --> 777.6
in having

773.6 --> 781.44
yeah having stress over

777.6 --> 783.519
i call the over conscious objection

781.44 --> 786.24
for what they're basically being told to

783.519 --> 788.399
do with the corona measures

786.24 --> 789.44
it's a pretty extensive article and that

788.399 --> 791.519
was really good

789.44 --> 794.5600000000001
it was good to put that they put that

791.519 --> 796.9590000000001
out i can imagine

794.56 --> 797.5999999999999
that a lot of cops which i think in the

796.959 --> 801.1999999999999
netherlands

797.6 --> 803.36
are really on average good people

801.2 --> 806.72
maybe even more than in other countries

803.36 --> 809.839
i can't really say for sure

806.72 --> 814.5600000000001
that they should be having this

809.839 --> 817.6800000000001
and it's just more signals that

814.56 --> 820.959
like everybody is getting sick of it

817.68 --> 823.199
like of the measures and they don't they

820.959 --> 824.16
it's useless they want they want to get

823.199 --> 826.639
rid of it

824.16 --> 828.3199999999999
the politicians that are still kind of

826.639 --> 831.519
on the forefront of pushing it

828.32 --> 834.88
are starting to basically display

831.519 --> 838.32
rumpus like nonsense

834.88 --> 840.16
blaming like protests on other political

838.32 --> 843.839
parties and all that nonsense

840.16 --> 843.8389999999999
it's really ridiculous

845.92 --> 850.7199999999999
so yeah the pointing of fingers has

848.24 --> 850.72
started

850.88 --> 857.04
because the yeah the control spell seems

853.839 --> 858.8000000000001
to have been broken it really does

857.04 --> 860.88
in many ways now there's still going to

858.8 --> 864.3199999999999
be

860.88 --> 866.0
the sheep out there that are not really

864.32 --> 869.839
going to know what to do with that and

866.0 --> 872.72
just still follow orders from television

869.839 --> 874.5600000000001
and those politicians no matter what

872.72 --> 876.24
but i think that the vast majority is

874.56 --> 879.3599999999999
really

876.24 --> 882.24
has really caught on at least that

879.36 --> 884.639
whatever is happening top down it just

882.24 --> 887.36
that cannot be trusted

884.639 --> 888.88
and that's good i'm kind of relieved

887.36 --> 899.839
about that

888.88 --> 899.8389999999999
sooner the better

905.6 --> 912.0
all right leaping 4j yeah i can imagine

909.6 --> 913.6
especially with international travel and

912.0 --> 916.56
then the quarantine

913.6 --> 917.36
things that is just that's terrible that

916.56 --> 921.199
is really

917.36 --> 924.0
bad very bad system

921.199 --> 924.639
because it makes international travel

924.0 --> 927.92
almost

924.639 --> 928.639
completely untenable except if we are

927.92 --> 931.8389999999999
going to be like

928.639 --> 941.839
migrating or something

931.839 --> 941.839
so yeah i agree

948.079 --> 952.7199999999999
okay here we go again uk not so much

952.839 --> 955.839
uh

957.839 --> 964.639
hey julio pabin good to see you thank

961.199 --> 964.639
you for the two dollar super chat

966.839 --> 969.839
donation

974.32 --> 979.759
oh man okay look the sun is coming out

981.12 --> 984.24
clear blue patch

985.759 --> 997.839
isn't that pretty

1008.839 --> 1013.6
hmm

1011.199 --> 1015.92
it's a global scam only going to going

1013.6 --> 1019.279
to get more authoritarian

1015.92 --> 1021.519
well as the scam is slipping

1019.279 --> 1022.8
as people are catching on to what's

1021.519 --> 1024.959
going on

1022.8 --> 1027.039
yes they will try to get more pushy to

1024.959 --> 1028.959
keep those that haven't really caught on

1027.039 --> 1032.8799999999999
that are caught in the spell

1028.959 --> 1034.799
to tighten up the the bars as it were

1032.88 --> 1036.48
so they don't dare to try and slip

1034.799 --> 1039.039
through

1036.48 --> 1041.3600000000001
to wake up from it so that only makes

1039.039 --> 1041.36
sense

1044.559 --> 1048.16
but at the same time you gotta realize

1046.559 --> 1051.44
that

1048.16 --> 1052.24
that sort of top-down cracking down

1051.44 --> 1054.72
behavior

1052.24 --> 1056.64
is really because it's not really

1054.72 --> 1059.3600000000001
working

1056.64 --> 1060.0800000000002
you know people have caught on and

1059.36 --> 1063.12
people are

1060.08 --> 1066.559
catching on everywhere like the vaccine

1063.12 --> 1068.7199999999998
what it's doing to the people taking it

1066.559 --> 1071.039
and there's already multiple countries

1068.72 --> 1071.6000000000001
now where certain types of vaccines that

1071.039 --> 1074.8799999999999
have been

1071.6 --> 1076.1599999999999
tried out and have yielded disastrous

1074.88 --> 1078.8400000000001
results

1076.16 --> 1080.88
they've been banned so that's already

1078.84 --> 1083.28
happening but it is not

1080.88 --> 1084.16
universal and still those freaking

1083.28 --> 1086.16
companies are

1084.16 --> 1087.44
they're not even like getting fines or

1086.16 --> 1090.96
anything there's just like no

1087.44 --> 1090.96
this country is not buying it

1091.28 --> 1096.8799999999999
when in reality those companies should

1093.679 --> 1096.88
just be persecuted

1097.039 --> 1104.799
they should be persecuted

1100.32 --> 1104.799
internationally right

1105.52 --> 1109.9189999999999
but who knows maybe given enough time

1108.24 --> 1112.24
that might happen

1109.919 --> 1112.24
you know

1118.48 --> 1127.039
it should happen because

1121.6 --> 1127.039
big vaccine mega corporations are

1127.12 --> 1131.9189999999999
yeah they provide no benefit to society

1129.84 --> 1133.6789999999999
none whatsoever they only provide

1131.919 --> 1136.16
detriments

1133.679 --> 1136.72
and yeah that might stimulate certain

1136.16 --> 1140.0800000000002
type of

1136.72 --> 1143.039
industrial interests but yeah

1140.08 --> 1143.52
none of the real public interests it

1143.039 --> 1146.48
only

1143.52 --> 1146.48
pretends to

1147.12 --> 1154.08
and they should just be like

1150.16 --> 1156.0
yeah they should be dismantled

1154.08 --> 1159.28
pretty much hey and if they want to

1156.0 --> 1162.32
start doing vaccines again

1159.28 --> 1165.36
just do it basic do it test it and

1162.32 --> 1167.6
none of this like this stuff

1165.36 --> 1168.6399999999999
experimental vaccines and then full

1167.6 --> 1171.76
exemptions in

1168.64 --> 1174.16
mass production even trying to force it

1171.76 --> 1174.8799999999999
on the public through politics and media

1174.16 --> 1179.8400000000001
that should

1174.88 --> 1179.8400000000001
never happen again it's

1182.32 --> 1188.24
like these are nazi situation like

1186.08 --> 1190.559
circumstances

1188.24 --> 1192.559
and it just shouldn't happen it should

1190.559 --> 1194.16
never have been able to happen in the

1192.559 --> 1196.799
first place

1194.16 --> 1197.2
but it just yeah people just let it all

1196.799 --> 1200.0
slip

1197.2 --> 1200.559
they let it all build they didn't do

1200.0 --> 1202.159
[ __ ]

1200.559 --> 1204.08
they were just thinking oh if they just

1202.159 --> 1205.1200000000001
got the extra scent to just get them a

1204.08 --> 1207.84
job

1205.12 --> 1208.9599999999998
whatever let it all go to [ __ ] well

1207.84 --> 1212.799
guess what

1208.96 --> 1215.52
you're in it now yeah oh you lazy

1212.799 --> 1215.52
[ __ ]

1218.64 --> 1222.3200000000002
didn't mentally lazy right i'm not

1220.72 --> 1224.48
saying oh

1222.32 --> 1225.6
if you want to have a job you're lazy

1224.48 --> 1227.52
now of course not

1225.6 --> 1229.84
but yeah you didn't really think it

1227.52 --> 1229.84
through

1231.84 --> 1238.0
a lot of people out there businesses

1235.76 --> 1239.12
i bet a lot of people have signed

1238.0 --> 1242.159
contracts

1239.12 --> 1244.559
which had [ __ ] like this

1242.159 --> 1248.0
work in there and they just trusted it

1244.559 --> 1252.36
all like oh yeah let's just trust the

1248.0 --> 1255.28
corporate emergency plan

1252.36 --> 1257.28
regulation blah blah blah and they just

1255.28 --> 1262.559
freaking signed it as part of the

1257.28 --> 1265.039
the setup what they were gonna do

1262.559 --> 1266.1589999999999
have no physical confirmation of it but

1265.039 --> 1269.36
i can damn well

1266.159 --> 1271.6000000000001
imagine it that this kind of stuff has

1269.36 --> 1271.6
been

1272.72 --> 1276.24
contractually worked into a lot of

1275.12 --> 1278.799
things

1276.24 --> 1281.28
causing all this [ __ ] to happen the way

1278.799 --> 1281.28
it does

1281.52 --> 1284.6399999999999
with corporations and media kind of

1283.919 --> 1288.48
enforcing

1284.64 --> 1290.0
it because of that because they didn't

1288.48 --> 1305.84
really realize what they were

1290.0 --> 1305.84
signing and they didn't object

1310.72 --> 1319.84
okay iron 26 i don't know exactly what

1313.84 --> 1319.84
you mean but

1323.44 --> 1333.8400000000001
hello seeking star wars devil

1345.52 --> 1350.1589999999999
uh yeah tara you shouldn't be joking

1347.679 --> 1350.159
about that

1353.679 --> 1356.799
it's not really funny

1358.24 --> 1363.2
all right see you later here we go again

1360.24 --> 1363.2
thanks for popping by

1369.76 --> 1375.6
all right okay never mind territ i'll

1372.64 --> 1378.72
take that back

1375.6 --> 1378.7199999999998
he's just an idiot

1380.88 --> 1384.7990000000002
hey kumu virus hello

1386.799 --> 1389.84
yeah i'm doing great

1401.2 --> 1404.64
all right well seeking star wars you

1403.28 --> 1408.08
know it's

1404.64 --> 1410.159
laziness it's complicated because what

1408.08 --> 1412.6399999999999
is laziness you know there's laziness on

1410.159 --> 1415.3600000000001
different levels

1412.64 --> 1416.0
you got lazy as in physical laziness

1415.36 --> 1419.36
people that

1416.0 --> 1421.52
like really don't like to do

1419.36 --> 1422.8799999999999
and engage stuff that kind of like to

1421.52 --> 1425.6
hang and dream and

1422.88 --> 1427.5200000000002
i don't know do drugs or whatever and

1425.6 --> 1428.9599999999998
not really do anything not learn

1427.52 --> 1431.84
anything not

1428.96 --> 1433.6000000000001
get creative in a durable kind of way

1431.84 --> 1435.76
that they actually end up with

1433.6 --> 1437.039
well pieces of art for example or

1435.76 --> 1439.279
whatever

1437.039 --> 1441.84
that sort of laid like true laziness

1439.279 --> 1446.64
like of

1441.84 --> 1450.559
lethargy i think that's what it's called

1446.64 --> 1453.6000000000001
and then you got laziness sloppiness

1450.559 --> 1456.1589999999999
as in people that don't re that

1453.6 --> 1458.24
they'll do stuff and they'll work but

1456.159 --> 1459.679
they don't really like to pay too much

1458.24 --> 1462.0
attention

1459.679 --> 1463.1200000000001
you know they don't really care that

1462.0 --> 1464.64
much as long

1463.12 --> 1466.1589999999999
as they don't get the blame for

1464.64 --> 1468.64
something and

1466.159 --> 1470.72
they don't stand out too much right that

1468.64 --> 1474.72
sort of laziness

1470.72 --> 1474.72
and then you got just

1474.88 --> 1479.44
intellectual laziness where people might

1477.36 --> 1481.6
even like really do their best

1479.44 --> 1483.039
on things and try to keep people

1481.6 --> 1486.32
together and

1483.039 --> 1490.96
keep things organized but they just

1486.32 --> 1493.76
bump into things they don't understand

1490.96 --> 1495.8400000000001
and then they don't proceed to over time

1493.76 --> 1499.279
truly get informed about them

1495.84 --> 1502.08
and then resort to lazy sources to trust

1499.279 --> 1505.12
that sort of laziness right so many

1502.08 --> 1508.48
different forms of laziness

1505.12 --> 1509.9189999999999
and a lot of people especially in the

1508.48 --> 1513.279
western world

1509.919 --> 1514.159
suffer from one form of these types of

1513.279 --> 1516.72
laziness

1514.159 --> 1516.72
or another

1517.36 --> 1521.36
so that's what i would say about that

1520.159 --> 1524.4
it's not all the same

1521.36 --> 1529.12
right it's like

1524.4 --> 1533.039
sloppiness and

1529.12 --> 1535.4399999999998
lack of self-informative nature

1533.039 --> 1537.6
those are different types of laziness

1535.44 --> 1538.24
but they are both grounded in the same

1537.6 --> 1543.84
effect

1538.24 --> 1543.84
with similar results

1546.32 --> 1553.12
what's the best way to overcome laziness

1549.679 --> 1557.1200000000001
well it's to realize where it leads

1553.12 --> 1561.1999999999998
to be honest about it and to get really

1557.12 --> 1561.1999999999998
introspective and confronting about it

1561.279 --> 1563.679
you know

1564.32 --> 1572.96
i i had like traits of what targia

1569.279 --> 1574.799
in in my teens and you know kind of

1572.96 --> 1576.799
smoking cannabis didn't really help

1574.799 --> 1579.44
you know in your teens it doesn't really

1576.799 --> 1581.52
help that much and i did

1579.44 --> 1583.679
and what really helped is just my

1581.52 --> 1586.4
parents basically getting pushy

1583.679 --> 1587.44
just saying no you're just gonna do this

1586.4 --> 1590.5590000000002
and then it would

1587.44 --> 1593.6000000000001
it would then basically my laziness

1590.559 --> 1599.84
would just say okay i'll just do it

1593.6 --> 1599.84
it's better than trying to resist it

1600.559 --> 1604.0
because yeah what can you really do in

1602.64 --> 1606.7990000000002
it about it

1604.0 --> 1608.159
it's all the closing off of energy

1606.799 --> 1613.039
circuits

1608.159 --> 1615.44
and of motivation systems within you

1613.039 --> 1616.32
and sometimes you kind of do need to

1615.44 --> 1618.64
retract

1616.32 --> 1619.4399999999998
when everything when you've gone through

1618.64 --> 1621.44
a lot

1619.44 --> 1623.679
and the world is quite overwhelming then

1621.44 --> 1626.3200000000002
often you do kind of need to retract

1623.679 --> 1628.4
you could or outsiders might even see

1626.32 --> 1631.6
that as like a

1628.4 --> 1633.76
fit of laziness and that's for recovery

1631.6 --> 1635.36
but if people stick in there and they

1633.76 --> 1637.44
don't know way out

1635.36 --> 1639.76
and then they kind of resort to lazy

1637.44 --> 1642.799
behavior in a form of escapism

1639.76 --> 1646.64
that's when things get bad and the only

1642.799 --> 1649.12
ways to really snap people out of it

1646.64 --> 1650.48
so you gotta get kind of like

1649.12 --> 1654.1589999999999
potentially mentally

1650.48 --> 1657.6
aggressive slightly or at least very

1654.159 --> 1657.6000000000001
harsh and direct about it

1661.2 --> 1666.0
you know never be tolerant towards

1664.24 --> 1670.0
laziness

1666.0 --> 1673.44
you know like the most tolerant thing

1670.0 --> 1675.76
you could do is ignore it for as long as

1673.44 --> 1676.64
it's possible but never like encourage

1675.76 --> 1680.84
it never

1676.64 --> 1684.3990000000001
say oh no laziness is

1680.84 --> 1687.52
never okay

1684.399 --> 1691.1999999999998
because it's also bad for a person

1687.52 --> 1691.2
it's bad for their development

1692.64 --> 1700.0
so if you tolerate somebody doing that

1695.76 --> 1704.0
well you're basically helping them

1700.0 --> 1706.559
slide that's my opinion about it

1704.0 --> 1707.679
it doesn't mean that people should

1706.559 --> 1712.72
always just

1707.679 --> 1715.2
get you know it depends also on just

1712.72 --> 1716.3990000000001
hierarchy you can't just step towards

1715.2 --> 1718.48
somebody you think you're

1716.399 --> 1720.1589999999999
they're lazy and then just get all pushy

1718.48 --> 1724.159
like you're their parents that doesn't

1720.159 --> 1726.48
work either

1724.159 --> 1728.72
you gotta have a connection first before

1726.48 --> 1732.0
you can reach people

1728.72 --> 1733.76
in that way they gotta have a connection

1732.0 --> 1735.279
they gotta have a sense of respect

1733.76 --> 1739.84
before they will

1735.279 --> 1739.84
potentially listen or respond

1745.44 --> 1750.8400000000001
yeah while seeking star water that's a

1748.799 --> 1753.84
little

1750.84 --> 1753.84
extreme

1754.64 --> 1757.8400000000001
and a lot of people don't they don't

1757.2 --> 1762.3990000000001
really

1757.84 --> 1762.399
see that you know it's a

1762.559 --> 1769.2
system that is very

1766.159 --> 1772.48
very much treated within this yeah and

1769.2 --> 1774.48
within general christianity the attitude

1772.48 --> 1776.88
you got to be busy you got to just do

1774.48 --> 1778.72
something or the energy is going to

1776.88 --> 1780.7990000000002
start to live a life of its own

1778.72 --> 1782.08
and then demons come through and use it

1780.799 --> 1785.12
basically

1782.08 --> 1787.36
right well regular mo a lot of people

1785.12 --> 1789.9189999999999
that aren't christian at all are not

1787.36 --> 1792.4799999999998
engaging in such communities

1789.919 --> 1793.679
they don't really see that they don't

1792.48 --> 1798.64
really realize it

1793.679 --> 1800.5590000000002
and they only really start to

1798.64 --> 1802.7990000000002
try to change when things have already

1800.559 --> 1806.039
gone out of control and

1802.799 --> 1809.2
their laziness whatever

1806.039 --> 1810.08
irresponsibility has grown to a point

1809.2 --> 1812.72
where they are

1810.08 --> 1814.32
actually a provable detriment to their

1812.72 --> 1815.52
surroundings

1814.32 --> 1818.24
right and that's when they start

1815.52 --> 1821.679
changing but yeah if you indeed just

1818.24 --> 1823.919
realize fundamentally in in the

1821.679 --> 1825.6000000000001
energy balances of what you are as a

1823.919 --> 1828.24
person

1825.6 --> 1829.039
and of just how that works like you get

1828.24 --> 1832.48
energy

1829.039 --> 1834.799
that energy needs to be used so use it

1832.48 --> 1837.6
for something constructive

1834.799 --> 1839.279
and then build it into a daily cycle a

1837.6 --> 1841.6789999999999
cycle of going about

1839.279 --> 1842.32
and that will work much better like you

1841.679 --> 1846.5590000000002
will get

1842.32 --> 1846.559
more energy and more success

1848.0 --> 1852.88
and it would be good if that that could

1851.44 --> 1856.88
be

1852.88 --> 1859.279
placed back within standard foundational

1856.88 --> 1862.72
western culture

1859.279 --> 1865.84
instead of just yeah do whatever

1862.72 --> 1865.84
do whatever you like

1877.76 --> 1883.519
what hello patricia dockery i'm starting

1881.12 --> 1885.9189999999999
to think we have a 90 minute

1883.519 --> 1887.44
attention span part of our arcadian

1885.919 --> 1890.0800000000002
rhythm but i don't know what you're

1887.44 --> 1890.0800000000002
talking about

1890.72 --> 1894.159
yeah test devil success is not

1893.039 --> 1897.6
subjective

1894.159 --> 1900.72
yeah it isn't success is success

1897.6 --> 1902.6399999999999
failure is failure right now

1900.72 --> 1904.96
whether you are going to use a

1902.64 --> 1907.919
colloquial version of that

1904.96 --> 1909.919
and place that over you in a social

1907.919 --> 1915.3600000000001
context that's something else

1909.919 --> 1915.3600000000001
but success as in a technical end result

1915.519 --> 1922.159
and failure another technical end result

1918.799 --> 1922.1589999999999
those are not subjective

1922.399 --> 1926.32
you either set out to succeed

1927.2 --> 1931.2
what you plan what you engaged in or you

1930.32 --> 1935.84
fail

1931.2 --> 1935.8400000000001
yeah it's not subjective

1936.88 --> 1940.0800000000002
hello james ii

1944.48 --> 1963.84
he's skeptical from flat earth debate

1947.679 --> 1963.8400000000001
okay hello i'm doing good

1974.84 --> 1977.84
hmm

1988.799 --> 1996.0
right yeah goals are subjective yeah

1992.08 --> 1997.12
potentially but a goal is mainly just a

1996.0 --> 1998.96
drive towards

1997.12 --> 2001.9189999999999
something you see where you want things

1998.96 --> 2004.72
to change towards

2001.919 --> 2006.96
so yeah it is subjective most of the

2004.72 --> 2006.96
time

2008.0 --> 2013.76
but often during the process it like

2011.36 --> 2014.799
everything that was envisioned then gets

2013.76 --> 2017.519
filled in

2014.799 --> 2019.6
solidified or replaced by an alternative

2017.519 --> 2024.08
part of the structure

2019.6 --> 2026.9599999999998
until the original vision dream

2024.08 --> 2029.519
is completely replaced by memory of

2026.96 --> 2029.519
actions

2029.679 --> 2035.2
and impressions

2033.12 --> 2036.6399999999999
and then afterward you can compare like

2035.2 --> 2038.48
how much

2036.64 --> 2047.8400000000001
did it actually work out the way i

2038.48 --> 2047.84
thought it would

2059.679 --> 2067.599
all right well seeking star wars

2063.44 --> 2067.599
mainstream society really

2068.24 --> 2073.4399999999996
failed to fit in well i see that as a

2070.879 --> 2076.639
success

2073.44 --> 2080.0
succeeding to fit into

2076.639 --> 2083.119
mainstream society

2080.0 --> 2083.119
i wouldn't want to be you

2085.76 --> 2090.48
not like that not like the way it is

2088.24 --> 2093.839
right now

2090.48 --> 2098.0
literally hiding in that chaotic soup

2093.839 --> 2101.2799999999997
of a moral corporatized

2098.0 --> 2106.32
psychological warfare

2101.28 --> 2110.1600000000003
influenced social engineering directed

2106.32 --> 2113.3590000000004
soup of behavior yeah no thanks

2110.16 --> 2117.68
i'd rather be a consistent

2113.359 --> 2120.72
natural naturally inspired

2117.68 --> 2120.72
human being

2122.24 --> 2128.8799999999997
that doesn't get caught up in a web of

2125.44 --> 2129.359
nonsense and manipulation and pretending

2128.88 --> 2131.76
to be

2129.359 --> 2133.359
something and being double faced about

2131.76 --> 2145.8390000000004
things

2133.359 --> 2145.839
you know

2151.52 --> 2157.599
all right well i would 26 failure

2154.56 --> 2158.0
like that is the colloquial failure so

2157.599 --> 2161.28
it's like

2158.0 --> 2164.96
a cultural opinion but you have to

2161.28 --> 2169.2000000000003
remember that failure is also

2164.96 --> 2172.4
just it's kind of empirical

2169.2 --> 2175.4399999999996
you can literally apply success and

2172.4 --> 2178.079
failure to the scientific method

2175.44 --> 2179.119
just set out to prove the cause of an

2178.079 --> 2182.48
effect

2179.119 --> 2186.0
you get empirical you test it then you

2182.48 --> 2189.28
fail to prove the cause of the effect

2186.0 --> 2192.8
or you succeed yeah

2189.28 --> 2197.3590000000004
it's not a spectrum let's say a

2192.8 --> 2200.079
a one zero situation

2197.359 --> 2200.56
but if it when it comes to hey how do

2200.079 --> 2203.8390000000004
you

2200.56 --> 2206.7999999999997
consider this person to be

2203.839 --> 2208.7999999999997
well that's not an on and off situation

2206.8 --> 2212.2400000000002
so it's much more colloquial it's a

2208.8 --> 2212.2400000000002
cultural meaning that way

2212.839 --> 2217.52
right

2215.52 --> 2219.28
if you see a person you don't know and

2217.52 --> 2222.64
another person you don't know

2219.28 --> 2224.6400000000003
and one of them tells you the other

2222.64 --> 2227.2799999999997
person is a failure

2224.64 --> 2228.72
that could literally mean absolutely

2227.28 --> 2230.6400000000003
anything

2228.72 --> 2233.04
could mean that that person is just

2230.64 --> 2235.44
really dissatisfied in their ego

2233.04 --> 2237.359
about the other and is jealous so

2235.44 --> 2240.32
they're actually great

2237.359 --> 2243.04
or it could mean that yeah the other

2240.32 --> 2245.599
person has had some difficult

2243.04 --> 2246.64
difficulty socially integrating or

2245.599 --> 2249.3590000000004
something

2246.64 --> 2251.44
but could still be a great person or the

2249.359 --> 2254.839
other person could be

2251.44 --> 2257.04
seemingly very rich and connected but

2254.839 --> 2260.16
constantly mocking up

2257.04 --> 2262.72
businesses making bad decisions and

2260.16 --> 2263.5989999999997
and going bust but still keeping it

2262.72 --> 2267.2
right so what is

2263.599 --> 2269.599
failure in that sense failure

2267.2 --> 2271.68
is kind of originally a technical world

2269.599 --> 2275.2000000000003
not a

2271.68 --> 2278.3999999999996
like a social stamp it's

2275.2 --> 2280.96
it's not just a universal judgment

2278.4 --> 2282.48
so but people have been using it anyway

2280.96 --> 2285.839
you know you can't stop people from

2282.48 --> 2285.839
doing that

2294.96 --> 2300.8
right so you just should keep it apart

2298.24 --> 2302.7999999999997
when somebody calls a person a failure

2300.8 --> 2305.8390000000004
that can mean anything

2302.8 --> 2309.04
when somebody causes or says

2305.839 --> 2309.04
a process

2309.119 --> 2315.359
a test a thing to do

2312.16 --> 2317.52
is a failure that's not

2315.359 --> 2318.72
subjective that's not widely

2317.52 --> 2321.7599999999998
interpretable

2318.72 --> 2322.56
it's two completely different things you

2321.76 --> 2325.0400000000004
would do good

2322.56 --> 2326.64
to keep them separate and not start over

2325.04 --> 2329.7599999999998
generalizing

2326.64 --> 2332.3199999999997
with sophistry that's just not very well

2329.76 --> 2332.32
informed

2333.28 --> 2341.8390000000004
hello amanda jung good to see you

2366.839 --> 2369.839
ah

2407.68 --> 2413.04
short-term success can lead to long-term

2409.52 --> 2413.04
failure and the other way around

2416.96 --> 2420.88
short-term failure can basically force

2420.24 --> 2424.72
you to

2420.88 --> 2428.2400000000002
look deeper inside yourself to

2424.72 --> 2430.9599999999996
apply more of yourself

2428.24 --> 2432.4799999999996
in order to on the long run gain the

2430.96 --> 2435.68
success that you

2432.48 --> 2437.68
really want so somebody that starts out

2435.68 --> 2441.2799999999997
with failures

2437.68 --> 2443.52
might actually learn more

2441.28 --> 2444.6400000000003
when they succeed in the end than those

2443.52 --> 2447.2
that succeed

2444.64 --> 2447.2
right away

2449.76 --> 2454.1600000000003
because knowing about failure does help

2452.72 --> 2456.16
a lot

2454.16 --> 2457.68
in understanding how things that you're

2456.16 --> 2461.2799999999997
going to be dealing with

2457.68 --> 2462.3999999999996
work learning from your mistakes it's

2461.28 --> 2464.8
critical

2462.4 --> 2467.839
it's an essential ingredient for

2464.8 --> 2467.8390000000004
personal growth

2469.04 --> 2473.2
right so nobody should be ashamed of

2471.76 --> 2476.2400000000002
failure

2473.2 --> 2478.48
when they first set out to do new things

2476.24 --> 2480.64
that are like really new to them never

2478.48 --> 2485.44
be ashamed of failure

2480.64 --> 2488.16
but always learn from it because

2485.44 --> 2490.56
if you don't learn from your failure or

2488.16 --> 2495.839
you don't even recognize it

2490.56 --> 2495.839
now that is real failure

2507.76 --> 2512.88
time changed how long till fvd begins

2510.319 --> 2512.88
now uh

2514.4 --> 2519.92
i don't know i think just in an hour and

2517.52 --> 2522.079
10 minutes

2519.92 --> 2523.359
i haven't seen nathan uh put out the

2522.079 --> 2526.88
link to the prim

2523.359 --> 2526.88
to the free show yet

2527.44 --> 2531.119
so it should just be an hour and ten

2529.04 --> 2537.839
minutes

2531.119 --> 2537.839
hey samson good to see you

2539.119 --> 2545.119
oh patricia dockery no fear is

2542.319 --> 2547.359
not the largest contributor to failure

2545.119 --> 2551.839
fear is the largest contributor

2547.359 --> 2551.839
to non-engagement

2552.24 --> 2557.5989999999997
because that's usually what it it stops

2555.359 --> 2559.92
it stops the engagement that's what fear

2557.599 --> 2559.92
does

2561.599 --> 2579.839
and if you don't engage you don't really

2563.76 --> 2579.8390000000004
fail you just don't engage

2612.56 --> 2620.88
leads to what well to

2615.76 --> 2623.8390000000004
not getting involved it's complicated

2620.88 --> 2624.96
you know but fear technically is also

2623.839 --> 2629.52
something that

2624.96 --> 2634.48
does cat that can absolutely acutely

2629.52 --> 2637.599
prevent disaster

2634.48 --> 2640.319
right not fear is not always bad it is

2637.599 --> 2642.4
just another sense it's just that

2640.319 --> 2644.24
when that sense is triggered it tends to

2642.4 --> 2647.52
kind of close off your options

2644.24 --> 2650.72
and get retracting start to form

2647.52 --> 2653.359
defensive strategies

2650.72 --> 2654.9599999999996
but that also prevents you from

2653.359 --> 2658.96
developing a lot of the time

2654.96 --> 2658.96
if you typically get stuck into it

2660.8 --> 2666.0
yeah dune is awesome i heard there's a

2663.04 --> 2666.0
new movie coming

2671.2 --> 2677.839
yeah we'll just wait and see what it's

2674.839 --> 2677.839
like

2682.0 --> 2689.76
they better not cram woke [ __ ] in there

2686.4 --> 2704.56
like if they do that oh my god the

2689.76 --> 2719.8390000000004
backlash gonna be incredible uh

2704.56 --> 2719.839
no roof isn't ovens

2721.599 --> 2733.839
that's nonsense iron 26 and it's not

2724.319 --> 2733.839
funny either

2759.359 --> 2764.16
dude there is no aquaman in the dune

2762.64 --> 2767.04
franchise

2764.16 --> 2767.04
it's stupid

2769.68 --> 2774.48
or you mean the actor the actor has a

2773.599 --> 2778.6400000000003
role in it

2774.48 --> 2778.64
okay sure that's not aquaman

2780.16 --> 2789.839
it's an actor

2809.52 --> 2817.839
ah yes father of stolen child gets it

2832.8 --> 2836.079
ah patricia duckery but that's not

2834.88 --> 2837.76
entirely true though

2836.079 --> 2839.76
and i'm gonna get philosophically

2837.76 --> 2840.4
nitpicky on that statement fear knocked

2839.76 --> 2843.5200000000004
at the door

2840.4 --> 2846.079
courage open it nothing was there

2843.52 --> 2848.24
yeah there is something there there is

2846.079 --> 2850.8
now an open door

2848.24 --> 2851.52
where if there was no fear there would

2850.8 --> 2853.6800000000003
have been

2851.52 --> 2859.839
nothing but a closed door that you

2853.68 --> 2859.839
probably wouldn't even know was there

2870.839 --> 2873.839
right

2880.079 --> 2883.6800000000003
yeah a good one and not just good one

2882.0 --> 2886.88
it's also real

2883.68 --> 2889.44
because there's for example

2886.88 --> 2891.359
clinical psychopaths that are born like

2889.44 --> 2892.64
that they don't necessarily even have to

2891.359 --> 2896.24
be evil

2892.64 --> 2900.64
that literally do not experience

2896.24 --> 2903.839
the sensation of fear and so

2900.64 --> 2904.64
they don't understand fear in others

2903.839 --> 2907.839
they just

2904.64 --> 2907.839
see the result

2908.16 --> 2914.64
right so then fear is not a sensation

2912.0 --> 2917.76
that they reflect upon it is a condition

2914.64 --> 2920.72
that they play upon

2917.76 --> 2924.079
because they don't know what it is they

2920.72 --> 2924.0789999999997
just see the results

2926.4 --> 2932.64
right so yeah without fear there would

2929.28 --> 2932.6400000000003
be no open door there

2932.72 --> 2943.839
once you had have the courage to open it

2951.839 --> 2960.0
turkey-ness with turkey-ness

2956.559 --> 2960.0
not bendy crane what

2960.079 --> 2965.04
what does it matter whether a crane was

2962.64 --> 2967.7599999999998
bendy or whatever it was visible it

2965.04 --> 2971.119
wasn't being blocked

2967.76 --> 2973.8390000000004
by earth curve black swan

2971.119 --> 2975.04
doesn't matter what that sighting looked

2973.839 --> 2977.52
like

2975.04 --> 2979.839
the fact that you could see it is the

2977.52 --> 2979.839
proof

2980.24 --> 2983.52
doesn't matter how weird it looked you

2982.72 --> 2986.9599999999996
could see it

2983.52 --> 2986.96
you can make out what it is

2987.2 --> 2991.52
that's the black swan because it wasn't

2989.76 --> 2994.7200000000003
being fully blocked

2991.52 --> 2999.839
by earth curve which it should be at

2994.72 --> 2999.839
all time if the earth was a ball

3020.079 --> 3025.04
what about the times you couldn't see it

3022.24 --> 3030.0
who gives a [ __ ]

3025.04 --> 3030.0
you still don't get it tiny momo my god

3031.04 --> 3035.44
it doesn't matter that at times you

3033.28 --> 3037.3590000000004
might not be able to see it it is

3035.44 --> 3042.48
completely irrelevant

3037.359 --> 3042.48
to the argument why don't you get it

3044.16 --> 3050.8799999999997
it doesn't matter that you sometimes

3047.28 --> 3054.0
can't see it if you can

3050.88 --> 3057.52
ever see it ever just once just

3054.0 --> 3060.559
once in a lifetime just once

3057.52 --> 3063.839
it's done it's over

3060.559 --> 3067.2000000000003
you understand earth

3063.839 --> 3070.24
globe geometry would never

3067.2 --> 3074.16
allow that site to be possible

3070.24 --> 3075.839
you can never look around the corner of

3074.16 --> 3079.839
a building

3075.839 --> 3080.319
without adding a mirror you can never do

3079.839 --> 3082.64
that

3080.319 --> 3084.48
you understand you can never do that

3082.64 --> 3086.0789999999997
there's not just this one day and you

3084.48 --> 3087.28
walk at the building and it's like whoa

3086.079 --> 3089.119
[ __ ]

3087.28 --> 3090.96
i'm looking that way but i can see

3089.119 --> 3095.2000000000003
around the corner and there's no mirror

3090.96 --> 3098.7200000000003
oh it's a miracle oh that means that

3095.2 --> 3111.839
whatever no no it's never possible

3098.72 --> 3111.839
to look around the corner you see never

3118.64 --> 3122.839
yeah rob h i don't really care tiny

3120.559 --> 3125.119
wumbo has been in my chat for over a

3122.839 --> 3128.24
year

3125.119 --> 3129.92
and that he still

3128.24 --> 3132.319
doesn't get it it's basically

3129.92 --> 3133.599
unacceptable

3132.319 --> 3135.7599999999998
you know if he doesn't want to talk

3133.599 --> 3136.319
about it that's one thing if it hurts

3135.76 --> 3139.3590000000004
too much

3136.319 --> 3140.5589999999997
that's fine but you get it right or you

3139.359 --> 3142.48
shut up

3140.559 --> 3144.1600000000003
because if you don't get it right now

3142.48 --> 3153.839
you're really [ __ ] dumb

3144.16 --> 3153.839
and i have less respect for you

3156.88 --> 3160.2400000000002
hello steven dutton

3161.52 --> 3168.96
yeah refraction yeah refraction can't

3165.119 --> 3171.52
make you see around the corner

3168.96 --> 3171.52
it can't

3172.48 --> 3177.44
but without radical radical medium

3176.079 --> 3178.1600000000003
change you're not talking about oh a

3177.44 --> 3180.319
little thicker

3178.16 --> 3181.92
air maybe a little moistened no no

3180.319 --> 3185.599
radical as it oh look

3181.92 --> 3186.64
solid glass suddenly a barrier universal

3185.599 --> 3188.96
barrier

3186.64 --> 3190.0789999999997
where everything after that point is

3188.96 --> 3192.559
solid glass

3190.079 --> 3193.599
or water all of a sudden right that

3192.559 --> 3196.88
might

3193.599 --> 3200.96
give some angular

3196.88 --> 3202.88
alteration after the medium changes

3200.96 --> 3204.0
yeah that happens to light all right

3202.88 --> 3206.2400000000002
well guess what

3204.0 --> 3207.04
that's not the situation out there it's

3206.24 --> 3209.7599999999998
all air

3207.04 --> 3211.599
all of it is just air any refraction is

3209.76 --> 3215.119
going to be kind of minor

3211.599 --> 3218.1600000000003
it's a minor deviation and it's not

3215.119 --> 3222.88
a circular deviation

3218.16 --> 3226.5589999999997
because refraction cannot make you look

3222.88 --> 3229.599
behind a physical obstruction

3226.559 --> 3232.88
it can only appear to

3229.599 --> 3236.7200000000003
displace visually displace

3232.88 --> 3241.359
an object in relation to the horizon

3236.72 --> 3244.7999999999997
it cannot displace the horizon

3241.359 --> 3250.319
cannot make you look behind

3244.8 --> 3252.0
a physical obstruction understand

3250.319 --> 3253.52
and it doesn't matter if you're going to

3252.0 --> 3257.76
insert the

3253.52 --> 3260.0
fictional 7 over 6 r refraction

3257.76 --> 3260.96
that doesn't do it either it doesn't

3260.0 --> 3264.079
matter how you

3260.96 --> 3267.2
claim that it can move in a circular

3264.079 --> 3272.079
fashion it still can't make you

3267.2 --> 3276.48
look behind a physical obstruction

3272.079 --> 3276.48
right the tangent line

3276.64 --> 3280.96
that makes you see the tangent point of

3279.119 --> 3283.839
the physical obstruction yeah you can't

3280.96 --> 3283.839
look behind that

3290.559 --> 3307.8390000000004
what you again get the [ __ ] out of here

3292.799 --> 3307.839
you [ __ ]

3311.92 --> 3316.319
hey chris berry good to see you a long

3313.76 --> 3316.3190000000004
time i see

3318.0 --> 3322.24
could the effect have to use liquid

3320.0 --> 3325.359
butane well

3322.24 --> 3329.3999999999996
it's not just that chris berry

3325.359 --> 3332.799
it's not within the liquid butane it's a

3329.4 --> 3336.559
transition from regular air

3332.799 --> 3340.559
to liquid butane a refraction

3336.559 --> 3341.92
index border of a radical medium change

3340.559 --> 3344.4
from that point on

3341.92 --> 3345.28
right yeah that can cause a refraction

3344.4 --> 3348.7200000000003
index

3345.28 --> 3352.799
corner change the light suddenly will

3348.72 --> 3355.9199999999996
go in a corner after the medium

3352.799 --> 3359.359
transit has been reached officially

3355.92 --> 3359.359
right that's what it does

3359.52 --> 3363.68
doesn't happen in a in a singular

3362.72 --> 3366.0
density

3363.68 --> 3368.799
basically situation if there's no

3366.0 --> 3372.079
radical medium change

3368.799 --> 3375.04
through which the visuals go radical

3372.079 --> 3377.44
difference then there is not going to be

3375.04 --> 3378.72
a corner change in the light doesn't

3377.44 --> 3381.04
happen

3378.72 --> 3383.839
it's going to be a minor notch very

3381.04 --> 3386.799
minor that's not going to

3383.839 --> 3391.839
get get you a circular radius like

3386.799 --> 3391.839
situation that's absolutely impossible

3416.319 --> 3419.92
you transcribed it

3420.64 --> 3427.44
what what do you mean

3424.319 --> 3430.64
you transcribed it you wrote down the

3427.44 --> 3434.48
music notes for it or something

3430.64 --> 3434.48
i'm pretty sure there's no text in that

3444.839 --> 3447.839
song

3450.559 --> 3457.2000000000003
and the light amount of light

3454.799 --> 3459.359
have to bend isn't that much yeah kumo

3457.2 --> 3461.4399999999996
virus yeah it is

3459.359 --> 3463.68
because it's not a singular corner

3461.44 --> 3466.96
change it's supposed to be

3463.68 --> 3467.5989999999997
circular which means that there has to

3466.96 --> 3470.799
be

3467.599 --> 3475.04
constant increase in density

3470.799 --> 3477.599
refraction index in order for not just

3475.04 --> 3479.2799999999997
a singular corner chains but a corner

3477.599 --> 3481.2000000000003
change upon a corner change upon a

3479.28 --> 3483.0400000000004
corner change right so

3481.2 --> 3485.7599999999998
the medium it would have to go through

3483.04 --> 3486.5589999999997
would have to be increasingly more dense

3485.76 --> 3490.3190000000004
up to

3486.559 --> 3492.2400000000002
absurd proportions guess what that's not

3490.319 --> 3493.7599999999998
that's not the world we're looking

3492.24 --> 3497.04
through out there

3493.76 --> 3500.48
yeah so you can drop

3497.04 --> 3505.359
the the nonsense science fiction physics

3500.48 --> 3505.359
because that's not the world yeah

3513.2 --> 3518.48
no akuma virus it doesn't it's not less

3516.0 --> 3521.04
than one degree

3518.48 --> 3522.48
seven over six our refraction is

3521.04 --> 3526.319
circular

3522.48 --> 3531.2
that's not less than one degree

3526.319 --> 3533.68
that is a constant cascade of a degree

3531.2 --> 3536.0789999999997
and another degree and another degree

3533.68 --> 3540.319
and another degree it's not a singular

3536.079 --> 3540.319
corner of one degree are you stupid

3542.799 --> 3559.839
and why am i asking i know you're stupid

3560.09 --> 3566.6400000000003
[Music]

3562.96 --> 3567.2
yeah you did it just have to bend one

3566.64 --> 3569.68
degree

3567.2 --> 3570.839
yeah yeah seven over six our refraction

3569.68 --> 3573.7599999999998
it has to

3570.839 --> 3576.96
bend degree

3573.76 --> 3578.92
upon degree upon degree of one degree

3576.96 --> 3581.76
and has to keep on

3578.92 --> 3584.4
continually bending

3581.76 --> 3586.1600000000003
that's circular right that's what it's

3584.4 --> 3589.04
supposed to be

3586.16 --> 3590.24
well the only way to even get close to

3589.04 --> 3593.44
trying achieving

3590.24 --> 3597.2
something like that in a set of visually

3593.44 --> 3601.119
is by having the light

3597.2 --> 3603.7599999999998
move through constantly

3601.119 --> 3606.4
changing mediums with increasing

3603.76 --> 3607.2000000000003
refraction index material so that every

3606.4 --> 3610.64
time

3607.2 --> 3614.64
the light transits into a new part

3610.64 --> 3616.799
it bends a little more right that's not

3614.64 --> 3617.68
the air we're looking through in this

3616.799 --> 3620.48
world

3617.68 --> 3620.48
yeah you get it

3625.68 --> 3629.68
that's not what is out there there's no

3627.76 --> 3632.3190000000004
way

3629.68 --> 3633.839
the earth was a globe you you just can't

3632.319 --> 3635.599
do that

3633.839 --> 3638.16
it's impossible it's physically

3635.599 --> 3642.2400000000002
impossible for light to do that

3638.16 --> 3646.72
in a singular medium without constant

3642.24 --> 3651.7599999999998
radical refraction index alterations

3646.72 --> 3651.7599999999998
yeah learn your optics

3651.92 --> 3658.0
i learned this [ __ ] in the 90s

3655.04 --> 3658.5589999999997
i literally experimented with it well

3658.0 --> 3660.799
not

3658.559 --> 3662.88
physically express but i experimented it

3660.799 --> 3664.96
with a raytrace program that kind of

3662.88 --> 3668.079
utilizes refraction indexes

3664.96 --> 3668.7200000000003
i was very fascinated by it yeah it took

3668.079 --> 3672.1600000000003
over an

3668.72 --> 3673.5989999999997
hour to render a single image but it was

3672.16 --> 3675.5989999999997
worth it

3673.599 --> 3676.799
absolutely worth fooling around with

3675.599 --> 3679.6800000000003
that

3676.799 --> 3679.68
it's fascinating

3679.839 --> 3684.4
especially things like glass and diamond

3682.88 --> 3686.88
because you could just simply

3684.4 --> 3687.839
shift the refraction index slider it's

3686.88 --> 3691.119
like

3687.839 --> 3692.319
right now it's air it's so weak a

3691.119 --> 3695.6800000000003
refraction index

3692.319 --> 3697.52
it's air oh now it's glass and it

3695.68 --> 3699.1189999999997
bends in a very specific way you know

3697.52 --> 3701.119
you take a sphere

3699.119 --> 3702.96
and then you make it that and then oh

3701.119 --> 3703.92
and then you shift it even for oh look

3702.96 --> 3707.04
it's

3703.92 --> 3711.2000000000003
now it's diamond it re the refraction

3707.04 --> 3713.7599999999998
index is even higher etc etc

3711.2 --> 3715.5989999999997
yeah it was very interesting to fool

3713.76 --> 3717.92
around with that back then

3715.599 --> 3719.76
i learned a lot from it i learned what

3717.92 --> 3722.96
refraction index was

3719.76 --> 3725.28
on an intuitive level

3722.96 --> 3740.2400000000002
because i got to experiment with it with

3725.28 --> 3744.559
basically an ambulatory

3740.24 --> 3744.5589999999997
yeah don't go there dude girl

3746.4 --> 3749.2000000000003
light is light

3752.24 --> 3755.9199999999996
it it definitely goes into one direction

3754.88 --> 3758.88
but there is arc

3755.92 --> 3760.319
there are arguments for a little bit

3758.88 --> 3763.839
more complex nature

3760.319 --> 3763.839
however it's not wave

3766.0 --> 3771.76
right anything about light

3769.039 --> 3772.88
that would suggest that it is a wave in

3771.76 --> 3775.119
nature all these

3772.88 --> 3777.2000000000003
alterations all these extras on top of

3775.119 --> 3779.28
it it's all [ __ ]

3777.2 --> 3781.359
it's not it's not a wave nothing about

3779.28 --> 3783.52
it is a wave it doesn't require a medium

3781.359 --> 3786.799
other than material

3783.52 --> 3790.16
to go through and it's not a wave

3786.799 --> 3793.68
it may display wave

3790.16 --> 3796.24
like properties but it's not a wave

3793.68 --> 3797.44
you get it it's just light it's weird

3796.24 --> 3800.9599999999996
it's something else

3797.44 --> 3804.16
it's not typically comparable to matter

3800.96 --> 3806.64
it's its own category

3804.16 --> 3808.16
yeah it doesn't have mass it doesn't

3806.64 --> 3812.16
have a density

3808.16 --> 3812.16
it's only defined in lumens

3812.799 --> 3818.0
it's different it's not a wave and in my

3816.16 --> 3821.2799999999997
opinion it's not a particle either

3818.0 --> 3824.64
because particle suggests an isolated

3821.28 --> 3828.559
minimum unit and i'm

3824.64 --> 3830.319
i'm not falling for that [ __ ]

3828.559 --> 3832.88
i've already explained that many times

3830.319 --> 3833.839
but i don't care to argue against it

3832.88 --> 3836.88
either

3833.839 --> 3838.5589999999997
because the science fiction tendency to

3836.88 --> 3841.76
interpret light as a wave

3838.559 --> 3845.6800000000003
is much more problematic like

3841.76 --> 3848.2400000000002
as in extremely problematic and causing

3845.68 --> 3849.52
mental havoc right now on the

3848.24 --> 3852.0
alternative seed

3849.52 --> 3853.44
with a lot of people constantly

3852.0 --> 3857.2
asserting that

3853.44 --> 3859.599
garbage you hear me owen benjamin

3857.2 --> 3860.8799999999997
yeah light is not a wave i don't give a

3859.599 --> 3863.52
[ __ ] if your wife

3860.88 --> 3864.88
is a physics teacher or whatever it's

3863.52 --> 3867.119
wrong

3864.88 --> 3870.88
you get it it's wrong you don't want to

3867.119 --> 3873.28
know you want to go through the stories

3870.88 --> 3875.76
of of your friends yeah that all say

3873.28 --> 3879.119
that that's your business

3875.76 --> 3881.8390000000004
but every time you say that you're wrong

3879.119 --> 3881.839
you get it

3882.64 --> 3889.839
every time i hear it it pisses me off

3886.64 --> 3890.48
and i don't care about what you think

3889.839 --> 3894.0
about that

3890.48 --> 3895.599
or me i'm just telling you it's wrong

3894.0 --> 3897.76
every time you say that you make

3895.599 --> 3899.599
yourself look like an ass

3897.76 --> 3901.8390000000004
and you're not helping the credibility

3899.599 --> 3905.28
of your wife

3901.839 --> 3907.839
right just don't do that it's stupid

3905.28 --> 3908.799
leave the stupid to the stupid and stick

3907.839 --> 3912.0
to what you know

3908.799 --> 3912.0
is absolutely true

3912.319 --> 3923.839
don't repeat other people's techno

3915.119 --> 3923.839
babble stories

3925.839 --> 3930.799
yeah samson yeah but the idea of a

3929.44 --> 3934.319
photon is also

3930.799 --> 3937.839
just you know photon is more convention

3934.319 --> 3937.839
than anything

3938.96 --> 3945.68
as far as i'm concerned light as i can

3942.24 --> 3947.839
size it up i don't even know how to

3945.68 --> 3950.5589999999997
prove it technically although i

3947.839 --> 3952.24
thought about it that light is just an

3950.559 --> 3954.6400000000003
infinitely divisible

3952.24 --> 3954.64
beam

3955.44 --> 3960.559
and i think it does actually have a

3957.2 --> 3964.24
speed but it can split up indefinitely

3960.559 --> 3967.599
right that that capability the ability

3964.24 --> 3971.5989999999997
to split up indefinitely is what

3967.599 --> 3974.2400000000002
is very much a better explanation to any

3971.599 --> 3976.319
wave-like properties right

3974.24 --> 3978.799
because that was the thing that the

3976.319 --> 3980.72
particle concept could not overcome and

3978.799 --> 3982.319
when it got all weird and quantum

3980.72 --> 3984.799
calculation based

3982.319 --> 3986.079
like oh it's theoretically splitting up

3984.799 --> 3988.559
and then merging again

3986.079 --> 3989.44
yeah yeah if you hear that [ __ ] story

3988.559 --> 3993.119
then of course

3989.44 --> 3996.319
of course a way seems more logical

3993.119 --> 4007.839
it isn't though it's still wrong

3996.319 --> 4007.839
both models are wrong they're just wrong

4018.079 --> 4022.96
it's a photon is not important it's a

4020.559 --> 4026.559
packet of energy

4022.96 --> 4028.319
okay well if it is signified that it is

4026.559 --> 4032.0
an infinitely divisible

4028.319 --> 4035.2
packet of energy then that is acceptable

4032.0 --> 4038.559
to me as a model in france

4035.2 --> 4040.96
that is acceptable but the

4038.559 --> 4042.3190000000004
yeah the infinitely divisible part of it

4040.96 --> 4046.48
is critical

4042.319 --> 4048.24
it's critical to the overall properties

4046.48 --> 4051.119
of light

4048.24 --> 4053.839
if it wasn't then sight would not be

4051.119 --> 4056.079
possible as we know it in my opinion

4053.839 --> 4059.359
my intuition tells me this has been

4056.079 --> 4062.799
telling me this for over 20 years

4059.359 --> 4066.88
like it cannot be

4062.799 --> 4069.119
it cannot have a finite size

4066.88 --> 4071.44
must be infinite otherwise nothing would

4069.119 --> 4071.44
work

4071.68 --> 4075.0389999999998
because then light would just basically

4074.4 --> 4091.839
halt

4075.039 --> 4091.8390000000004
much quicker much quicker

4095.2 --> 4098.5599999999995
right yeah frequency making colors

4097.04 --> 4100.08
that's right splitting up light

4098.56 --> 4101.279
splitting up light in the different

4100.08 --> 4103.759
colors yeah

4101.279 --> 4105.279
well if you assume they're particles

4103.759 --> 4108.08
with a finite size

4105.279 --> 4109.120000000001
all of that is complete garbage it's

4108.08 --> 4113.12
complete

4109.12 --> 4116.88
nonsense doesn't make any damn sense

4113.12 --> 4122.08
right but if it's infinitely

4116.88 --> 4122.08
divisible it could be altered

4122.56 --> 4133.839000000001
then it makes sense then

4125.679 --> 4133.839
a rainbow prismatic pattern makes sense

4139.44 --> 4146.48
yeah neil i didn't want to get to that

4142.719 --> 4149.679
i'll leave it to the whatever

4146.48 --> 4152.718999999999
but yeah there were some

4149.679 --> 4155.279
really really stupid things said again

4152.719 --> 4155.279
yesterday

4155.92 --> 4160.56
and uh somebody thought it was necessary

4158.48 --> 4165.44
to literally

4160.56 --> 4166.0
steal my optical slant and name it

4165.44 --> 4170.0
something

4166.0 --> 4175.839
really stupid like the dumbest

4170.0 --> 4175.839
name you could imagine for it they chose

4176.4 --> 4182.0
it's freaking embarrassing dude

4179.52 --> 4184.0
i i don't want to get near these people

4182.0 --> 4186.839
with a 10 foot pole

4184.0 --> 4188.159
they all belong in mental institutes i'm

4186.839 --> 4190.159
serious

4188.159 --> 4191.92
yeah and that's me saying that yeah yeah

4190.159 --> 4196.639999999999
it's true though they do

4191.92 --> 4196.64
they do belong there they're freaking

4200.84 --> 4203.84
insane

4214.84 --> 4217.84
uh

4228.48 --> 4232.639999999999
right so cleared that up about light

4233.199 --> 4236.48
put down my complaint about somebody

4235.84 --> 4240.08
that i

4236.48 --> 4243.04
overall liked their works off a lot

4240.08 --> 4244.719
and then i started blabbering on light

4243.04 --> 4248.4
incoherent dielectric

4244.719 --> 4251.679
blah blah blah techno babble

4248.4 --> 4254.4
bad flat earth narrative

4251.679 --> 4255.84
bad narrative yeah there's a lot of it

4254.4 --> 4258.96
techno babble

4255.84 --> 4262.2390000000005
garbage tech no babble

4258.96 --> 4264.96
garbage no logic lots of

4262.239 --> 4267.759999999999
unproven just so story garbage and it's

4264.96 --> 4270.2390000000005
spreading around like wildfire

4267.76 --> 4271.52
like oh we're wizards now oh we're so

4270.239 --> 4273.199
smart because we can say

4271.52 --> 4275.1990000000005
something that we don't even freaking

4273.199 --> 4276.799999999999
understand and not really test and it's

4275.199 --> 4280.08
all blah blah blah

4276.8 --> 4284.400000000001
sophistry garbage nobody

4280.08 --> 4285.84
should re repeating that parroting it

4284.4 --> 4289.199
because that's the only thing you can

4285.84 --> 4290.88
really do with it just parrot it

4289.199 --> 4293.12
because if you really understand what's

4290.88 --> 4294.4800000000005
going on you'd stay away from it with a

4293.12 --> 4301.84
10 foot pole it's just

4294.48 --> 4301.839999999999
freaking embarrassing what's going on

4302.96 --> 4307.12
i'm not talking about globals in

4305.12 --> 4311.5199999999995
newfounds

4307.12 --> 4314.48
but yeah yeah safe to say that baller

4311.52 --> 4315.120000000001
do it even worse but yeah that's what's

4314.48 --> 4317.04
what's their

4315.12 --> 4319.28
what are they supposed to do you know

4317.04 --> 4320.88
everything you believe in is wrong

4319.28 --> 4322.5599999999995
so yeah that's the only thing you got

4320.88 --> 4325.84
left just

4322.56 --> 4328.0
garbage techno babble sophistry and red

4325.84 --> 4330.719
herring [ __ ] yeah that's all you got

4328.0 --> 4333.44
so yeah i don't blame you for that right

4330.719 --> 4337.199
because what else are you gonna do

4333.44 --> 4340.4
flat earthers however yeah we're in a

4337.199 --> 4342.799999999999
potential or we are in a effective

4340.4 --> 4343.679
winning position so if you're then gonna

4342.8 --> 4347.04
introduce

4343.679 --> 4350.56
technobabble garbage yeah

4347.04 --> 4354.0
that's literally just destroying

4350.56 --> 4357.84
our renaissance destroying

4354.0 --> 4360.96
our renaissance with sophistry

4357.84 --> 4362.400000000001
garbage you should be ashamed of

4360.96 --> 4364.96
yourself people

4362.4 --> 4367.599999999999
the people that do that yeah you should

4364.96 --> 4371.84
be ashamed of yourself

4367.6 --> 4371.84
really seriously

4396.84 --> 4399.84
eh

4405.12 --> 4413.84
hey flat earth absolutely flat earth

4407.52 --> 4413.84
vodka good to see you

4414.0 --> 4418.159
see you have this new thing where you

4415.679 --> 4420.08
say that mars is also flat

4418.159 --> 4421.44
i've been seeing you say that a couple

4420.08 --> 4427.36
of times

4421.44 --> 4441.839999999999
it's very funny

4427.36 --> 4441.839999999999
hey ciao and cat good to see you

4446.719 --> 4454.64
oh really iron 26

4449.84 --> 4457.84
wrong oh oh you have to take a position

4454.64 --> 4460.320000000001
about something you don't know

4457.84 --> 4462.64
and oh since we don't have a better

4460.32 --> 4464.96
alternative we're just going to ignore

4462.64 --> 4468.0
the evidence against it

4464.96 --> 4471.12
no no you don't

4468.0 --> 4474.48
that's really stupid

4471.12 --> 4477.199
that's where you turn what you do into

4474.48 --> 4477.199
priesthood

4477.84 --> 4483.84
you should never try to move

4480.88 --> 4485.28
beyond what you know if you're gonna

4483.84 --> 4488.88
speculate that's all

4485.28 --> 4492.4
fine but leave it officially

4488.88 --> 4495.76
announce it as speculation

4492.4 --> 4497.92
don't start to claim it is the only

4495.76 --> 4499.92
possibility

4497.92 --> 4502.159
don't do that i don't even freaking do

4499.92 --> 4502.96
that with my looping realm concept and

4502.159 --> 4506.0
i'm like

4502.96 --> 4507.92
almost completely convinced that that is

4506.0 --> 4510.64
just the end gonna be the end result

4507.92 --> 4514.159
right but i know i can be wrong

4510.64 --> 4517.1990000000005
so i'm not just going to like oh i'm so

4514.159 --> 4521.12
right about this i'm just gonna

4517.199 --> 4523.28
like make all universities like adapt

4521.12 --> 4525.199
the concept or whatever no no no

4523.28 --> 4526.8
if anything i'll keep it the science

4525.199 --> 4528.879999999999
fiction

4526.8 --> 4530.320000000001
because that is the best part to make

4528.88 --> 4533.4400000000005
people understand it

4530.32 --> 4535.759999999999
right i'm not going to

4533.44 --> 4536.879999999999
reify something that i don't have

4535.76 --> 4540.320000000001
evidence for

4536.88 --> 4542.56
into reality yet i'll tell you

4540.32 --> 4546.08
the steps you could undertake in order

4542.56 --> 4549.120000000001
to figure out whether it is true or not

4546.08 --> 4552.88
right i'm not going to

4549.12 --> 4556.159
step ahead and just reify it anyway

4552.88 --> 4559.04
because i'm a lazy piece of [ __ ] like so

4556.159 --> 4563.36
many other [ __ ] out there

4559.04 --> 4563.36
yeah that's bad

4564.159 --> 4569.28
you don't do that it's called

4578.84 --> 4584.400000000001
integrity

4581.04 --> 4584.4
yeah well iron 26

4584.64 --> 4588.320000000001
what you said kind of was stupid

4589.76 --> 4594.320000000001
i'm sorry sorry you don't like that but

4592.64 --> 4596.0
if you're going to say oh you have to

4594.32 --> 4598.639999999999
take a claim

4596.0 --> 4601.84
because debunking only gets you so far

4598.64 --> 4601.84
or that's just wrong

4602.239 --> 4605.919999999999
you don't start claiming things when you

4604.4 --> 4610.32
don't have evidence for

4605.92 --> 4614.4800000000005
it just because you want a story

4610.32 --> 4614.48
yeah it's called reification

4615.6 --> 4623.84
you don't do that it's not the right

4619.28 --> 4623.84
thing to do it's not scientific

4623.92 --> 4628.2390000000005
we never said that oh really so how

4626.64 --> 4630.4800000000005
about

4628.239 --> 4632.959999999999
you can only run on the fumes of

4630.48 --> 4637.839999999999
debunking and never take a position

4632.96 --> 4637.84
for so long though

4644.159 --> 4649.12
right 2 21

4649.36 --> 4652.32
four minutes ago

4653.36 --> 4665.839999999999
you did say that you said exactly that

4675.44 --> 4683.678999999999
oh so you did stand by that okay

4679.28 --> 4685.44
okay not experimenting oh people lose

4683.679 --> 4688.56
interest

4685.44 --> 4688.5599999999995
who gives a [ __ ]

4689.04 --> 4692.239
gives a [ __ ] if people just want to be

4691.199 --> 4695.36
entertained

4692.239 --> 4696.718999999999
by nonsense and sophistry that's their

4695.36 --> 4698.639999999999
own damn prerogative

4696.719 --> 4702.159
right so go to the science fiction

4698.64 --> 4704.320000000001
channel go to blah blah blah blah blah

4702.159 --> 4706.32
i'd like to keep things real i like to

4704.32 --> 4708.96
be a genuine theorist

4706.32 --> 4710.0
that has integrity and that doesn't

4708.96 --> 4713.04
reify

4710.0 --> 4715.84
[ __ ] into absolute reality

4713.04 --> 4718.08
because otherwise my audience might be

4715.84 --> 4721.84
slightly less entertained

4718.08 --> 4721.84
the [ __ ]

4726.8 --> 4735.84
i mean if you're bored with this you can

4729.04 --> 4735.84
always go somewhere else you know

4746.84 --> 4749.84
so

4756.0 --> 4759.92
oh really so you never said claim

4758.239 --> 4763.36
something that wasn't provable

4759.92 --> 4764.0
so what does that mean then what you did

4763.36 --> 4767.759999999999
say

4764.0 --> 4770.159
you can only go on debunking for so long

4767.76 --> 4771.4400000000005
before people get bored so what does

4770.159 --> 4773.759999999999
that suggest why

4771.44 --> 4774.719
can't can you be honest can you just be

4773.76 --> 4777.6
honest

4774.719 --> 4778.4
about what you really said and what what

4777.6 --> 4781.6
you said

4778.4 --> 4784.639999999999
implies because i'm pretty sure there's

4781.6 --> 4786.8
only one way to interpret that

4784.64 --> 4788.84
in the context of the conversation

4786.8 --> 4791.84
that's been happening in the last 20

4788.84 --> 4791.84
minutes

4797.6 --> 4802.56
i'm sorry if i'm being a little hard on

4800.0 --> 4802.56
your ear

4802.84 --> 4808.400000000001
but yeah just not gonna let that slip

4816.84 --> 4819.84
through

4821.6 --> 4833.84
hey ordinary bear good to see you

4837.04 --> 4847.84
good for you taz devil

4858.84 --> 4861.84
okay

4866.48 --> 4872.839999999999
no it's

4869.52 --> 4875.84
funny that you say that iron 26 but

4872.84 --> 4878.56
no how many roller coaster rides can you

4875.84 --> 4880.639
do before it become pointless

4878.56 --> 4882.4800000000005
so when is the natural progression to

4880.639 --> 4884.32
build your own how many people do you

4882.48 --> 4887.04
know have gone

4884.32 --> 4889.36
to roller coaster rides and then started

4887.04 --> 4891.36
to proceed to build their own

4889.36 --> 4894.32
did you actually think about that before

4891.36 --> 4894.32
you pressed enter

4899.04 --> 4903.84
but it's okay i'll get off your ass

4932.48 --> 4945.839999999999
all right got 30 minutes more to go

4949.44 --> 4952.719
what globe claim is used to know it we

4952.4 --> 4956.719
see

4952.719 --> 4959.76
too far uh

4956.719 --> 4963.679
the geometry the

4959.76 --> 4966.08
geometry the geometry

4963.679 --> 4967.1990000000005
right it's a globe right the globe is

4966.08 --> 4972.0
geometric

4967.199 --> 4977.28
it's a geometric shape it has a geometry

4972.0 --> 4980.08
yeah so the globe geometry

4977.28 --> 4980.08
is used

4980.32 --> 4987.84
to point out we see too far

4995.76 --> 5001.1990000000005
all right well yeah iron 26 your analogy

4998.719 --> 5003.36
just completely falls flat

5001.199 --> 5005.839999999999
look if you're getting bored with it for

5003.36 --> 5007.759999999999
whatever reason then just step away

5005.84 --> 5009.92
you wouldn't be the only one doing that

5007.76 --> 5010.719
a lot of people that are in flat earth

5009.92 --> 5013.4400000000005
just

5010.719 --> 5015.28
take vacations at times because they get

5013.44 --> 5019.28
sick of it

5015.28 --> 5023.48
it'll get back to you just need a break

5019.28 --> 5026.239
but yeah i'm not gonna let that

5023.48 --> 5028.5599999999995
dissatisfaction change the way i do

5026.239 --> 5028.5599999999995
things

5030.48 --> 5035.199
i'm gonna do it the way i think i should

5033.28 --> 5038.08
do it

5035.199 --> 5040.4
and i'm not gonna let people reify

5038.08 --> 5042.0
unproven things into reality because

5040.4 --> 5046.799999999999
they have to have some kind of

5042.0 --> 5046.8
option to hold up and talk about all the

5054.84 --> 5057.84
time

5066.239 --> 5070.0
oh yeah yeah jargar good question how

5069.12 --> 5074.96
does the sunset

5070.0 --> 5074.96
work what's the sun exactly

5076.8 --> 5081.360000000001
you know when we're talking about oh how

5079.199 --> 5082.638999999999
things work well what are those things

5081.36 --> 5084.639
exactly right

5082.639 --> 5086.4800000000005
it's a little difficult to figure out

5084.639 --> 5089.28
how those things work

5086.48 --> 5090.159
when we don't technically even know what

5089.28 --> 5099.84
the things

5090.159 --> 5099.839999999999
involved are exactly right

5102.48 --> 5108.159
uh no absolutely flat earth vodka

5105.6 --> 5108.159000000001
i don't

5111.199 --> 5116.5599999999995
but who knows maybe there is somewhere

5113.44 --> 5119.919999999999
underground or whatever a

5116.56 --> 5122.4800000000005
a mars dome project it's still look i've

5119.92 --> 5125.76
been talking about that as a conspiracy

5122.48 --> 5126.879999999999
idea even like four years back says like

5125.76 --> 5130.159000000001
oh yeah they might just

5126.88 --> 5132.159000000001
emulate a a margin base somewhere

5130.159 --> 5134.96
underground and then have like a

5132.159 --> 5135.36
terrarium where it really looks like

5134.96 --> 5137.76
it's

5135.36 --> 5138.639
the star heaven around supposed mars and

5137.76 --> 5142.08
then they can just

5138.639 --> 5143.6
smuggle people in there i don't put them

5142.08 --> 5145.199
in hibernation then they

5143.6 --> 5147.280000000001
they place them in there and it's like

5145.199 --> 5149.28
oh they wake up oh yeah we got this dome

5147.28 --> 5152.4
built you can't really get outside but

5149.28 --> 5155.04
that's what's needed to keep the oxygen

5152.4 --> 5155.5199999999995
and then it would be like a live truman

5155.04 --> 5157.92
show

5155.52 --> 5159.6
like an underground truman show for the

5157.92 --> 5162.96
mars expedition

5159.6 --> 5168.320000000001
i thought that idea of four years ago

5162.96 --> 5172.639
on record on my shows

5168.32 --> 5176.639
so who knows but

5172.639 --> 5176.96
yeah it's i don't think they're ready

5176.639 --> 5179.76
for

5176.96 --> 5180.56
anything like that by a long shot things

5179.76 --> 5186.0
are way

5180.56 --> 5186.0
too unstable out here for anything like

5194.84 --> 5199.04
that

5196.08 --> 5199.6
is a conversation could be beyond the

5199.04 --> 5201.76
article

5199.6 --> 5201.76
no

5204.32 --> 5213.679
just know

5210.48 --> 5216.879999999999
like they can't do it outside

5213.679 --> 5220.8
they can't emulate a mars outside

5216.88 --> 5220.8
with actual people it just can't

5221.199 --> 5225.5199999999995
because yeah what happens when night

5223.04 --> 5227.5199999999995
falls oh look everything's the same

5225.52 --> 5228.8
oh yeah yeah how long is that gonna take

5227.52 --> 5231.4400000000005
before they catch on

5228.8 --> 5232.88
it's just not gonna happen a bunch of

5231.44 --> 5235.12
robots or whatever

5232.88 --> 5237.4400000000005
with cameras not pointing up too much

5235.12 --> 5239.199
yeah they could do that

5237.44 --> 5241.919999999999
if they're gonna send actual people to

5239.199 --> 5244.48
something no it has to be underground

5241.92 --> 5246.4800000000005
because they have to re-engineer what

5244.48 --> 5253.839999999999
the heavens look like or people

5246.48 --> 5253.839999999999
will catch on extremely quickly

5264.639 --> 5270.56
well iron 26 um hate to be uh

5268.08 --> 5272.88
stepping on your toes there again but no

5270.56 --> 5277.52
it's not an infant plane

5272.88 --> 5281.28
there is no infinity in physical reality

5277.52 --> 5283.92
it's impossible there might be a lot

5281.28 --> 5283.92
more though

5291.04 --> 5296.96
this is the crater earth i don't know

5295.76 --> 5308.159000000001
i don't know what you're talking about

5296.96 --> 5310.719
tara 306.

5308.159 --> 5311.839999999999
no absolute flat earth vodka no i'm not

5310.719 --> 5315.199
talking about

5311.84 --> 5317.28
the literal mars red light we see in the

5315.199 --> 5318.159
sky that's just the red light we see in

5317.28 --> 5321.759999999999
the sky

5318.159 --> 5322.48
i was talking about emulating you know

5321.76 --> 5326.0
fooling

5322.48 --> 5328.239
a stage fake a fake

5326.0 --> 5329.04
mars project that's what i was talking

5328.239 --> 5332.5599999999995
about not an

5329.04 --> 5334.84
actual mars there is no actual mars

5332.56 --> 5336.0
mars is a light in the sky it is not a

5334.84 --> 5339.84
place

5336.0 --> 5343.04
not in the physical world nowhere

5339.84 --> 5346.400000000001
doesn't exist there is no physical mars

5343.04 --> 5350.96
there is no physical mars there is

5346.4 --> 5353.28
no physical mars get over it

5350.96 --> 5354.32
all of the heavenly bodies none of it is

5353.28 --> 5357.679
a physical place

5354.32 --> 5360.88
anywhere anywhere understand

5357.679 --> 5364.88
not a physical place anywhere it's

5360.88 --> 5368.8
all lights that's the only thing it is

5364.88 --> 5372.96
only thing are no physical places

5368.8 --> 5372.96
that correlate with the heavenly bodies

5374.48 --> 5379.839999999999
no no it isn't

5392.4 --> 5399.12
proponent of ancient mind syrian relief

5396.08 --> 5402.48
well if they're going to say

5399.12 --> 5404.239
sun goes through a portal that sounds

5402.48 --> 5406.48
like descriptory

5404.239 --> 5408.48
and based still on a presupposition that

5406.48 --> 5409.839999999999
the sun is actually a physical thing in

5408.48 --> 5411.919999999999
a euclidean position

5409.84 --> 5413.28
which it isn't and yeah if you would

5411.92 --> 5414.96
have to justify that

5413.28 --> 5417.12
yeah i would do it through a portal as

5414.96 --> 5420.08
well however

5417.12 --> 5421.5199999999995
it's not a physical object at all it's

5420.08 --> 5425.44
just a light based

5421.52 --> 5428.8
apparition a side effect

5425.44 --> 5432.839999999999
of sight when looking into

5428.8 --> 5434.08
the direction at which the daylight

5432.84 --> 5436.719
manifests

5434.08 --> 5439.04
towards you your position that's what it

5436.719 --> 5442.08
is it's the only thing it is

5439.04 --> 5444.32
it doesn't go anywhere it's not a thing

5442.08 --> 5446.239
it's not in any literal position there

5444.32 --> 5446.5599999999995
is no portal required because there is

5446.239 --> 5462.718999999999
no

5446.56 --> 5468.080000000001
physical thing to be transported

5462.719 --> 5468.08
no no that's just wrong

5471.12 --> 5475.12
this is wrong what dome

5475.44 --> 5478.719
how do you know the dome would even be

5477.04 --> 5481.04
circular

5478.719 --> 5482.88
oh because somebody took a glass thing

5481.04 --> 5483.679
and then shown a light on it and you

5482.88 --> 5485.4400000000005
were very

5483.679 --> 5486.8
inspired and satisfied oh that is what

5485.44 --> 5490.0
that must be like

5486.8 --> 5493.12
no some dogs no

5490.0 --> 5495.52
they don't prove a dome the sun

5493.12 --> 5496.4
is not a physical object it doesn't have

5495.52 --> 5500.56
a location

5496.4 --> 5503.5199999999995
if you try to go there it bends away

5500.56 --> 5504.080000000001
it doesn't become bigger it's not coming

5503.52 --> 5506.8
from

5504.08 --> 5509.6
a dome it's not coming from any

5506.8 --> 5512.88
euclidean physical location

5509.6 --> 5515.76
anywhere not inside the realm

5512.88 --> 5518.639
not outside the realm it doesn't have a

5515.76 --> 5521.679
literal location it's a light apparition

5518.639 --> 5522.2390000000005
there is no literal sun position there

5521.679 --> 5525.36
is

5522.239 --> 5533.199
no literal sun position there is

5525.36 --> 5536.32
no literal sun position

5533.199 --> 5536.32
you can't prove [ __ ]

5536.639 --> 5547.84
you got as much proof as pj does

5561.84 --> 5566.2390000000005
where does the light come from it comes

5563.44 --> 5566.239
from over there

5566.56 --> 5573.52
yeah comes from a direction

5569.76 --> 5577.6
doesn't come from a thing it manifests

5573.52 --> 5582.080000000001
it appears comes into being

5577.6 --> 5582.08
the closer it is to you

5586.96 --> 5590.4800000000005
terror 306 no no no he's boycotted

5589.28 --> 5593.199
everyone

5590.48 --> 5595.759999999999
and blocked like half the people out

5593.199 --> 5598.4
there including myself

5595.76 --> 5601.84
so pj's no it's like he needs his he

5598.4 --> 5603.839999999999
needs a permanent safe space

5601.84 --> 5605.84
even everywhere else so he will still

5603.84 --> 5607.84
come and just ramble on but he doesn't

5605.84 --> 5617.84
really want to interact with people as

5607.84 --> 5617.84
much as he used to i think

5629.76 --> 5634.2390000000005
yeah that's your problem terry36

5640.48 --> 5644.32
dude pj's been around for like five

5642.719 --> 5646.719
years on youtube

5644.32 --> 5649.28
just not gonna summarize the whole damn

5646.719 --> 5649.28
thing to you

5655.12 --> 5661.199
just let's just say safe to say he's

5658.239 --> 5663.759999999999
always been like that he's just gone a

5661.199 --> 5663.759999999999
little bit

5670.84 --> 5673.84
worse

5684.639 --> 5701.84
what the [ __ ] it's not your [ __ ]

5687.84 --> 5701.84
business [ __ ]

5718.239 --> 5721.839999999999
uh yeah jargon a good question the

5721.119 --> 5725.599999999999
answer is

5721.84 --> 5726.32
no no it's not it's absolutely different

5725.6 --> 5729.84
and it is

5726.32 --> 5729.84
uniquely different

5730.4 --> 5738.638999999999
so glaringly different

5735.119 --> 5742.239
it is the difference

5738.639 --> 5744.56
like we can make it always has to be

5742.239 --> 5746.5599999999995
euclidean it always originates from a

5744.56 --> 5747.92
point it's always subjected to the

5746.56 --> 5751.76
infrasquare law

5747.92 --> 5754.4800000000005
always yeah that's all the light that

5751.76 --> 5755.6
we can make it's the only form we can

5754.48 --> 5758.638999999999
make light with

5755.6 --> 5762.56
in that fashion yeah and then you have

5758.639 --> 5763.4400000000005
the celestialites which do not abide by

5762.56 --> 5767.04
those standards

5763.44 --> 5771.599999999999
at all ever it's completely different

5767.04 --> 5773.84
and we don't know how yeah

5771.6 --> 5775.4400000000005
you can speculate about all i could be a

5773.84 --> 5778.719
wizard

5775.44 --> 5781.44
though this special special unique

5778.719 --> 5782.96
formula blah blah blah yeah there's no

5781.44 --> 5784.799999999999
freaking proof yeah

5782.96 --> 5786.4
can make up all kinds of science fiction

5784.8 --> 5790.56
[ __ ] about it

5786.4 --> 5793.92
there's no proof you can't emulate it

5790.56 --> 5796.8
yeah you whoever you are out there

5793.92 --> 5798.2390000000005
you can't do that any light you're gonna

5796.8 --> 5801.84
make is gonna be

5798.239 --> 5805.04
local euclidean light

5801.84 --> 5808.159000000001
every single time

5805.04 --> 5811.6
you can't make light that

5808.159 --> 5814.879999999999
originates from a non-local position

5811.6 --> 5818.400000000001
you can't do that only god can do that

5814.88 --> 5822.159000000001
only the celestial heavens is that

5818.4 --> 5824.638999999999
you can't yeah

5822.159 --> 5826.5599999999995
so don't try to [ __ ] people and that

5824.639 --> 5831.28
you know how it works

5826.56 --> 5833.6
you don't i don't i can only describe

5831.28 --> 5834.88
the data that i've carefully tried to

5833.6 --> 5837.6
disseminate from

5834.88 --> 5840.56
everything that's the only thing i can

5837.6 --> 5843.360000000001
do is describe it i don't know how

5840.56 --> 5855.84
i just know that's what it is that's the

5843.36 --> 5855.839999999999
data we have

5858.639 --> 5862.4800000000005
what the hell are you blabbering about

5862.639 --> 5868.719
instead of physical measurement what

5865.679 --> 5872.719
fit no physical measurements like

5868.719 --> 5873.04
oh look a foot observer height we can

5872.719 --> 5875.28
see

5873.04 --> 5876.8
several miles away oh and that's not

5875.28 --> 5880.0
measurement according to you that's

5876.8 --> 5880.0
philosophy is it

5880.159 --> 5886.638999999999
is that is that exclusively philosophy

5884.48 --> 5888.799999999999
or just saying oh we see it because it's

5886.639 --> 5890.719
there i have a straight line aside

5888.8 --> 5892.56
there's not a curvature in the way

5890.719 --> 5894.159
that's it's just philosophy it's not

5892.56 --> 5895.92
measurement is it

5894.159 --> 5898.48
i'm pretty sure that's all pretty

5895.92 --> 5899.6
empirical based

5898.48 --> 5902.638999999999
don't know where you're getting this

5899.6 --> 5905.679
from roof and saint hubbins

5902.639 --> 5911.84
his arguments are not invalidated and

5905.679 --> 5911.84
your opinions are stupid

5912.4 --> 5919.679
it isn't it's not exclusively philosophy

5917.36 --> 5922.0
it's all based in empiricism that's not

5919.679 --> 5923.36
philosophy

5922.0 --> 5927.44
seem to have a little bit of trouble

5923.36 --> 5927.44
with the meaning of the word philosophy

5927.679 --> 5930.56
and laugh it up

5932.239 --> 5939.839999999999
you're wrong

5950.4 --> 5953.599999999999
yeah he's wrong and you're wrong too a

5952.4 --> 5956.0
kumu virus

5953.6 --> 5958.2390000000005
what you can't handle it you don't like

5956.0 --> 5960.8
nathan anymore now

5958.239 --> 5962.0
you've gone a bit tired of it of him

5960.8 --> 5965.04
ramming

5962.0 --> 5967.84
it in your head basic logic you don't

5965.04 --> 5967.84
like it anymore

5968.8 --> 5985.119000000001
good good yeah take it back that's right

5981.84 --> 5987.679
that's okay that's okay

5985.119 --> 5990.0
i just thought that maybe you were just

5987.679 --> 5991.4400000000005
going on that sliding path all of a

5990.0 --> 5992.4
sudden you know a lot of flat earthers

5991.44 --> 5994.879999999999
just do that

5992.4 --> 5995.44
just like one day decide i don't like

5994.88 --> 5998.2390000000005
nathan

5995.44 --> 6000.799999999999
anymore i'm just gonna lie about him and

5998.239 --> 6003.04
just talk really really stupid things

6000.8 --> 6005.52
even i've been sitting there listening

6003.04 --> 6007.119
to the details for years and certainly

6005.52 --> 6009.280000000001
no he's wrong

6007.119 --> 6010.239
yeah a lot of people do that and when i

6009.28 --> 6012.639
pick up on that

6010.239 --> 6014.5599999999995
i'm absolutely gonna mercilessly kick

6012.639 --> 6017.36
you in the ass

6014.56 --> 6019.52
and remind you of what you're doing yeah

6017.36 --> 6022.719
so it's good that you're not

6019.52 --> 6036.96
one of these cases right now it's very

6022.719 --> 6039.199
good for you

6036.96 --> 6040.719
now it's not an opinion though you know

6039.199 --> 6044.159
liking disliking

6040.719 --> 6046.0
you said he only his he only has proof

6044.159 --> 6049.44
grounded in philosophy it's just wrong

6046.0 --> 6051.679
and i pointed out exactly right

6049.44 --> 6052.96
it's not about an opinion it's about

6051.679 --> 6055.92
making a statement that's

6052.96 --> 6055.92
wrong right

6059.84 --> 6065.84
either you're right or you're wrong

6085.92 --> 6090.4
what's this ah all right nathan's

6089.04 --> 6092.4
already

6090.4 --> 6095.679
opened the panel so it should be flatter

6092.4 --> 6107.839999999999
of the bits in 10 minutes from now

6095.679 --> 6107.84
and i will be part of that

6127.44 --> 6131.04
pre-show must be on yeah it is

6131.119 --> 6137.04
but i still got 10 minutes to fill

6135.04 --> 6138.48
that's a pretty decent show today i

6137.04 --> 6141.199
don't know what it is but there's a lot

6138.48 --> 6143.119
of people ready to bump heads i guess

6141.199 --> 6146.719
it's one of those days where suddenly

6143.119 --> 6149.44
people just decide to pick fights

6146.719 --> 6153.04
something in that direction maybe

6149.44 --> 6155.04
everybody's feeling really dissatisfied

6153.04 --> 6157.4
don't know what it is could be

6155.04 --> 6160.4
springtime too you know because

6157.4 --> 6162.239
dissatisfaction will typically arise in

6160.4 --> 6163.839999999999
certain individuals during that period

6162.239 --> 6165.839999999999
because they are basically

6163.84 --> 6167.28
in a visceral process of getting

6165.84 --> 6172.08
instinctually

6167.28 --> 6175.5199999999995
elbowing their way to conquer

6172.08 --> 6177.28
a partner this all purely instinct so

6175.52 --> 6179.040000000001
they're not even

6177.28 --> 6180.719
aware of that so it is logical the

6179.04 --> 6183.199
closer you get to spring

6180.719 --> 6185.52
certain people will just start to for no

6183.199 --> 6187.36
seeming reason pick fights

6185.52 --> 6188.56
and they don't even really know why

6187.36 --> 6190.799999999999
because it's this ring

6188.56 --> 6192.080000000001
and they're basically showing off to try

6190.8 --> 6194.320000000001
and get a mate

6192.08 --> 6195.44
it's a very instinctive process it

6194.32 --> 6198.32
happens to people

6195.44 --> 6199.199
and they very rarely know it when it

6198.32 --> 6205.84
happens to them

6199.199 --> 6205.839999999999
so maybe that's going on

6216.239 --> 6221.36
yeah brenda yeah brandon chad that's

6219.119 --> 6221.36
fine

6221.679 --> 6227.679
i saw that i kind of ignored her

6224.719 --> 6230.0
but yeah brenda welcome to my show in

6227.679 --> 6230.0
chat

6230.88 --> 6235.679
she just came into just to say wrong

6233.36 --> 6235.679
though

6238.239 --> 6242.4
but i'm pretty sure she's watching me on

6240.4 --> 6247.839999999999
a regular basis

6242.4 --> 6247.839999999999
because what else are you gonna do

6250.719 --> 6255.92
calling someone no no

6254.08 --> 6258.719
i just got eight more minutes and i

6255.92 --> 6260.8
don't really have a good

6258.719 --> 6262.56
communication connection for the show

6260.8 --> 6264.88
last time i tried with skype

6262.56 --> 6267.04
like the sound is super super low so

6264.88 --> 6271.1990000000005
it's not really worth it at this time

6267.04 --> 6274.639
i i gotta fix my sound situation

6271.199 --> 6275.599999999999
somewhere in the near future but yeah

6274.639 --> 6279.28
for now

6275.6 --> 6280.88
i'm not gonna do that unless it's like

6279.28 --> 6282.719
really urgent somebody like really

6280.88 --> 6284.56
demands to come on

6282.719 --> 6289.84
but that would have to be in the earlier

6284.56 --> 6289.84
part of the show

6295.199 --> 6299.919999999999
yeah i'm sure you do brenda yeah you did

6298.719 --> 6304.56
send me an email

6299.92 --> 6304.56
you weren't ben and

6306.639 --> 6310.96
yeah i haven't heard from you since then

6314.84 --> 6320.4800000000005
so

6316.4 --> 6320.48
oh my god tara you're such a noob

6320.639 --> 6325.92
asking who is brenda is like asking who

6323.199 --> 6325.919999999999
is rumpus

6328.719 --> 6332.56
and like asking who is george net nuke

6331.119 --> 6335.759999999999
and you don't know him either because

6332.56 --> 6335.76
you're such a noob

6336.4 --> 6341.839999999999
you should have gotten on the flat earth

6337.92 --> 6341.84
debates three years ago instead of one

6343.199 --> 6348.5599999999995
uh brenda is just a is a globe

6346.48 --> 6350.159
philosopher she likes to really

6348.56 --> 6351.76
philosophize about

6350.159 --> 6353.92
her interpret her artistic

6351.76 --> 6354.719
interpretations of the scientific method

6353.92 --> 6356.8
and all

6354.719 --> 6358.719
so she was the one that came up that the

6356.8 --> 6360.719
phenomena in the scientific method could

6358.719 --> 6364.0
be a shoe

6360.719 --> 6367.44
and that dog bones or clocks

6364.0 --> 6373.84
that's her work she's she specializes in

6367.44 --> 6373.839999999999
that kind of self-history

6378.8 --> 6384.0
trying to build a channel really okay

6384.88 --> 6401.84
but do you actually have a youtube

6386.96 --> 6401.84
channel yet

6402.96 --> 6407.44
yeah also the bending of space-time is

6405.52 --> 6415.84
is the hole in a donut

6407.44 --> 6415.839999999999
that also came from brenda

6431.199 --> 6436.879999999999
but i'm just asking brenda do you have a

6434.239 --> 6437.44
youtube channel yet or is this a plan

6436.88 --> 6443.84
you are

6437.44 --> 6443.839999999999
working on which one is it

6455.76 --> 6465.280000000001
yes you do okay

6459.52 --> 6468.84
well just to spare myself a lot of time

6465.28 --> 6472.08
i'm gonna give you a wrench so you can

6468.84 --> 6474.2390000000005
post the link to your channel so at

6472.08 --> 6485.84
least we know where it is

6474.239 --> 6485.839999999999
are you okay doing that

6487.119 --> 6490.239
if you could store

6491.52 --> 6497.6
the link text in your copy reserve

6496.159 --> 6513.839999999999
i'll give you the wrench and then you

6497.6 --> 6513.84
can post it

6529.92 --> 6534.0
i get the idea brenda is interfacing

6532.4 --> 6540.0
over her phone

6534.0 --> 6543.52
because she's very very slow

6540.0 --> 6543.52
all right tara 306

6550.239 --> 6552.718999999999
a test

6553.76 --> 6557.119000000001
do you have the link ready brenda just

6556.719 --> 6560.32
say

6557.119 --> 6569.839999999999
yes or no then i'll give you the wrench

6560.32 --> 6569.84
if you say yes

6578.08 --> 6581.28
look if you're not gonna do it in two

6579.52 --> 6582.88
