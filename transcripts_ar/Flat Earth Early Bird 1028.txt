it's less cloudy

101.119 --> 108.479
very windy it's still cool though

104.0 --> 108.479
didn't think the p put the heater on

111.04 --> 115.2
has been raining a lot i thought for a

113.52 --> 117.2
moment this morning that it was going to

115.2 --> 119.28
be a nice and sunny day again but

117.2 --> 121.84
doesn't seem like it

119.28 --> 121.84
after all

122.799 --> 127.28
yeah yesterday was just

124.88 --> 130.319
clouded and rainy

127.28 --> 130.319
a lot of the time

132.56 --> 135.92000000000002
let's see what today brings

140.08 --> 144.4
i bet it's

141.2 --> 144.39999999999998
still cooled down

144.879 --> 148.67
let's check it

147.59 --> 151.88
[Music]

148.67 --> 151.88
[Applause]

152.4 --> 157.84
yeah it's still 40 degrees celsius i

154.879 --> 157.84
thought so

160.4 --> 163.76000000000002
right

162.48 --> 165.67999999999998
so

163.76 --> 170.599
it is thursday

165.68 --> 170.59900000000002
the 30th of september 2021

172.8 --> 174.959
and

178.959 --> 183.92000000000002
nobody in chat just yet

181.76 --> 187.04
huh that's what you get when you start

183.92 --> 187.04
on time for a change

187.76 --> 192.48
but yeah i'll be doing a two-hour show

190.879 --> 195.76
and i expect there's not going to be a

192.48 --> 195.76
flat earth debates again

196.159 --> 199.84
so we'll see where it goes

200.319 --> 208.72
i am very seriously hoping on

203.92 --> 212.07999999999998
getting a paypal donation exactly today

208.72 --> 214.239
because literally in two days

212.08 --> 216.56
i might actually not be able to pay my

214.239 --> 216.56
rent

219.68 --> 227.12
for your information

222.64 --> 230.23899999999998
i'm gonna be having to twist myself

227.12 --> 232.799
in order to get that done

230.239 --> 237.36
and still be able to eat

232.799 --> 237.36
oh are we complaining pants yeah yeah

238.84 --> 242.72
whatever it's the truth

244.799 --> 247.76000000000002
feeling the strain

248.72 --> 255.159
hello good servant

251.599 --> 255.159
first in chat

260.799 --> 268.919
all right so yesterday's plenty streams

265.6 --> 268.91900000000004
out there

271.52 --> 277.59999999999997
for sure for some reason sean hawkins

273.759 --> 280.96000000000004
did a 20 26 second video of mine and it

277.6 --> 282.88
was the point

280.96 --> 286.56
even though yeah

282.88 --> 288.88
i don't know sean hawkins might just be

286.56 --> 290.24
going another step down on the critical

288.88 --> 293.199
thought letter

290.24 --> 295.199
so he thought that what i said was so

293.199 --> 299.28000000000003
apparently crazy

295.199 --> 302.24
it on itself was just a point

299.28 --> 302.23999999999995
i didn't get it

307.6 --> 313.44
right also

310.96 --> 315.75899999999996
yeah brandon life of course

313.44 --> 318.4
was great

315.759 --> 320.639
to listen to that in the background

318.4 --> 321.919
uh mitchell from australia had a live

320.639 --> 325.72
stream

321.919 --> 325.71999999999997
it was great again

328.24 --> 331.759
uh what else

330.0 --> 334.72
yeah numpty clip

331.759 --> 334.72
really funny one

336.84 --> 346.0
uh oh right also eric dubay did a video

343.12 --> 348.479
about ghosts and the paranormal

346.0 --> 350.56
that's kind of unexpected but

348.479 --> 354.639
still

350.56 --> 354.639
decent enough information

356.88 --> 361.36
uh

357.759 --> 361.36
right so that's pretty much it

363.919 --> 367.84
for my activities yesterday

368.4 --> 370.63899999999995
uh

372.479 --> 377.22999999999996
oh oops

374.02 --> 377.22999999999996
[Music]

377.919 --> 381.35999999999996
other than that yeah it's been very

379.52 --> 383.12
quiet

381.36 --> 385.6
for me on the scene since there's no

383.12 --> 387.759
live letter debates i am really missing

385.6 --> 387.759
it

389.28 --> 393.55999999999995
hope nathan gets back soon

412.319 --> 416.52000000000004
all right so what's keeping everybody

425.759 --> 432.40000000000003
all right anyway i was watching the

427.919 --> 432.4
first part of own benjamin yesterday

433.599 --> 439.759
interesting interesting thought also

436.319 --> 442.24
finished up watching that catacombs

439.759 --> 442.24
episode

442.4 --> 446.56
and that the really odd

444.639 --> 448.639
idea like and i've been confronted with

446.56 --> 451.599
that before i think

448.639 --> 454.479
about how like

451.599 --> 457.12
those bone catacombs really are a bit of

454.479 --> 457.12
a mystery

459.199 --> 463.039
because of well the reasons that he

461.36 --> 464.72
explained basically

463.039 --> 468.4
and they like

464.72 --> 470.639
it might be fake it might simply be

468.4 --> 472.23999999999995
like a theatrical

470.639 --> 475.039
product

472.24 --> 477.28000000000003
where there aren't actual skulls they're

475.039 --> 479.84
cast they could be

477.28 --> 479.84
cast

480.08 --> 486.24
as in not original

483.199 --> 487.759
bones and i thought that that is it's

486.24 --> 489.759
it's fascinating

487.759 --> 494.24
i've never seen any of this sort of

489.759 --> 496.24
stuff up close and yeah

494.24 --> 498.0
skeletons and all that

496.24 --> 500.16
always especially when i was younger

498.0 --> 502.96
made me very nervous so

500.16 --> 504.16
i think somebody might have told me it

502.96 --> 506.71999999999997
was fake

504.16 --> 509.03900000000004
but i was just too distracted to be able

506.72 --> 509.759
to accept it

509.039 --> 512.08
and

509.759 --> 514.24
couldn't dispel it

512.08 --> 516.08
so yeah

514.24 --> 517.36
what he talked about kind of did remind

516.08 --> 521.08
me about that

517.36 --> 521.08
just keeps me wondering

525.279 --> 529.36
right

526.88 --> 532.0
also a good idea from his side on this

529.36 --> 535.44
stream today that i got so far

532.0 --> 537.76
that's yes wednesday's stream

535.44 --> 540.9590000000001
about how alcohol prohibition may have

537.76 --> 540.959
actually been about

542.48 --> 545.6
basically

544.0 --> 546.88
de-standardizing

545.6 --> 547.6
alcohol

546.88 --> 549.12
st

547.6 --> 550.8000000000001
stills

549.12 --> 552.8
at farmers

550.8 --> 554.399
because they were using that as a fuel

552.8 --> 556.56
source

554.399 --> 558.959
i've never even thought about that that

556.56 --> 561.959
was a really good point from his from

558.959 --> 561.959
him

564.24 --> 568.9590000000001
all right hello drunkenbullet411 good to

566.64 --> 568.959
see you

569.04 --> 572.76
slow mo moon buggy

583.6 --> 585.9200000000001
all right

588.8 --> 591.8
hmm

605.2 --> 610.9590000000001
how are you doing drunkenbullet411

607.2 --> 613.839
haven't seen you in a week or so

610.959 --> 613.8389999999999
hope you're doing well

616.24 --> 622.6
matthew mitchell

619.04 --> 622.5999999999999
good to see you

633.36 --> 640.0
tired yeah well good servant i get that

636.959 --> 640.0
considering that

640.64 --> 645.76
it might even be earlier in steamy

643.36 --> 647.839
traveler never mind

645.76 --> 651.519
basically

647.839 --> 654.5600000000001
clarified that for me yesterday that

651.519 --> 657.76
the west coast may even be earlier

654.56 --> 660.3199999999999
compared to me and when i stream than i

657.76 --> 662.3199999999999
thought

660.32 --> 664.6400000000001
that it's like four o'clock

662.32 --> 666.72
apparently

664.64 --> 671.56
so yeah

666.72 --> 671.5600000000001
that's a pretty crazy time to get up

676.72 --> 679.9200000000001
for it would be for me

678.72 --> 682.399
anyway

679.92 --> 684.3199999999999
well yeah i've had like period

682.399 --> 686.72
pretty long periods

684.32 --> 690.0
but not regularly

686.72 --> 692.48
where i would get up very early

690.0 --> 695.04
it would be like a restless super early

692.48 --> 696.64
morning i would get a lot of creativity

695.04 --> 698.3199999999999
done

696.64 --> 701.3199999999999
when i was in that

698.32 --> 701.32
rhythm

707.279 --> 710.399
okay

708.72 --> 713.2
australia is slowly coming out of

710.399 --> 716.16
lockdown you say okay

713.2 --> 718.8000000000001
okay

716.16 --> 720.639
if that's actually true that's good

718.8 --> 722.8
it's not the impression that i'm getting

720.639 --> 726.399
so far from media but then again yeah

722.8 --> 728.16
media is very deceptive and manipulative

726.399 --> 730.32
these days

728.16 --> 732.16
hey terminoid

730.32 --> 733.519
tony whitcomb

732.16 --> 737.24
good to see you

733.519 --> 737.24
seeking star water

744.8 --> 750.76
you have a two-year-old so what sleep

746.8 --> 750.76
again oh right right

750.78 --> 759.4499999999999
[Music]

762.88 --> 765.88
ah

799.839 --> 804.0
depends on when you live okay

809.92 --> 815.04
but also i think it also depends on how

812.24 --> 816.5600000000001
many people have taken the v right

815.04 --> 819.519
because i'm a

816.56 --> 823.3599999999999
very strong suspicion

819.519 --> 825.519
refer to it yesterday that this winter

823.36 --> 825.519
like

826.399 --> 834.0
almost everybody i think that has had it

829.68 --> 834.0
is going to run into a big problem

834.639 --> 841.639
because as it used to be called the flu

837.6 --> 841.639
season will be coming

852.16 --> 856.68
oh jesus tell me what's going on

867.839 --> 870.9590000000001
yeah i've seen that one seeking star

869.68 --> 872.8
order yeah i'm

870.959 --> 874.7199999999999
i'm getting old

872.8 --> 877.4399999999999
everybody's seeing that

874.72 --> 880.72
is wrote like all these testimonies

877.44 --> 880.72
situations that happen

880.8 --> 885.8389999999999
we're all getting shoved in our faces

882.639 --> 885.839
from all sides

887.36 --> 891.519
and i definitely picked up on that one

896.56 --> 903.4399999999999
and hey he's not the first one to

899.76 --> 903.4399999999999
basically do something like that

905.519 --> 910.399
or she i mean says she apparently karen

910.56 --> 914.56
the names and how

915.04 --> 921.92
makes me wonder is that real though

917.92 --> 921.92
i have no definitive evidence

922.24 --> 926.12
because of the name composition

934.959 --> 938.16
blood is boiling oof

938.959 --> 941.8389999999999
i'll chill out

950.72 --> 954.279
oh man

955.04 --> 958.3199999999999
hey gadget inspector

961.68 --> 966.68
oh my god where is this coming from

975.12 --> 982.889
where's pj stalker yeah it's ridiculous

979.83 --> 982.889
[Music]

997.12 --> 1003.519
so yeah i'm feeling the tension guys

1000.8 --> 1003.519
i really am

1004.8 --> 1009.5999999999999
in my case it is because of my financial

1007.199 --> 1012.92
situation i really need help guys i

1009.6 --> 1012.9200000000001
really do

1057.76 --> 1060.76
right

1068.24 --> 1073.52
right if this keeps up if this tension

1071.84 --> 1076.799
gets worse tomorrow because this is

1073.52 --> 1078.799
something that's been coming for a while

1076.799 --> 1081.12
and i've been postponing it in order to

1078.799 --> 1082.96
basically not let it distract me and do

1081.12 --> 1085.039
good shows and i think i have done a

1082.96 --> 1087.2
couple of really good shows recently i

1085.039 --> 1089.039
think they were very good

1087.2 --> 1090.72
when i watched back

1089.039 --> 1093.52
everything

1090.72 --> 1098.0
was to my own satisfactory in the face

1093.52 --> 1098.0
of like watching even a month ago

1098.64 --> 1103.5200000000002
yet

1100.48 --> 1106.48
my f financial situation is

1103.52 --> 1109.12
creeping up on me is getting very in my

1106.48 --> 1112.08
face now and it is literally i get

1109.12 --> 1112.08
tension bombs

1113.84 --> 1118.48
because

1115.039 --> 1122.12
in ways in what i do here i also receive

1118.48 --> 1122.1200000000001
you guys tension

1123.039 --> 1127.679
because that's what i do normally to

1125.28 --> 1130.96
basically get into the subjects to find

1127.679 --> 1135.48
something useful to say or that

1130.96 --> 1135.48
right now i'm not handling it well

1147.12 --> 1151.84
first of the month is tomorrow people

1148.88 --> 1151.8400000000001
out

1152.96 --> 1156.96
i hope so

1154.4 --> 1158.799
i really do

1156.96 --> 1161.799
i'm also nervous it will be a little

1158.799 --> 1161.799
late

1162.98 --> 1166.099
[Music]

1169.76 --> 1174.36
so

1171.11 --> 1174.36
[Music]

1189.6 --> 1195.1999999999998
right guys i've been filling in

1192.4 --> 1198.64
pretty much for

1195.2 --> 1201.44
nathan's holiday also like i i feel i

1198.64 --> 1205.0800000000002
really do deserve some here i really i

1201.44 --> 1205.0800000000002
really need it hard

1212.72 --> 1220.28
i don't want to talk about just that but

1216.08 --> 1220.28
it's really pressing on me

1241.6 --> 1244.6
so

1256.32 --> 1259.6789999999999
right

1257.36 --> 1263.84
and i think i'm also gonna contact my

uh

1500.24 --> 1504.559
right so this should definitely

1504.72 --> 1509.919
oh god because i gotta

1507.52 --> 1513.279
switch it all around you see i when i'm

1509.919 --> 1516.3200000000002
this stressed out by the finances

1513.279 --> 1518.96
i put it in my white noise section

1516.32 --> 1520.72
just to be able to not be so freaking

1518.96 --> 1522.72
distracted over it and now i have to

1520.72 --> 1523.52
just like oh wait how does

1522.72 --> 1526.96
this

1523.52 --> 1529.84
where does this part fit in that

1526.96 --> 1529.8400000000001
but yeah

1535.679 --> 1539.2
and a fair

1537.52 --> 1541.6
preliminary assessment that should

1539.2 --> 1543.3600000000001
definitely

1541.6 --> 1546.32
get me through the

1543.36 --> 1546.32
the next week

1547.6 --> 1554.1589999999999
and probably not more

1550.96 --> 1554.159
maybe a little more

1554.88 --> 1559.279
but it's great

1556.48 --> 1561.279
because otherwise it would have been a

1559.279 --> 1565.72
certain dead end

1561.279 --> 1565.72
so i thank you very much

1572.96 --> 1575.96
uh

1585.84 --> 1591.4399999999998
i'm literally dizzy it's weird man

1588.64 --> 1594.159
it's weird how much

1591.44 --> 1595.44
psychological tension it literally has

1594.159 --> 1596.48
on your

1595.44 --> 1599.52
on the

1596.48 --> 1602.08
visceral system

1599.52 --> 1603.76
the pressures there's literally pressure

1602.08 --> 1605.4399999999998
right it's not just metaphorical

1603.76 --> 1609.36
pressure when you're stressed out about

1605.44 --> 1609.3600000000001
something it's it's physical

1611.679 --> 1615.679
and it's pressure management added

1625.12 --> 1630.32
but yeah thank you so thank you guys so

1628.0 --> 1630.32
much

1630.48 --> 1634.08
that is pretty much exactly what i

1632.32 --> 1636.1589999999999
needed

1634.08 --> 1639.72
and what i was hoping on and i really

1636.159 --> 1639.72
appreciate it

1646.88 --> 1650.88
so

1648.72 --> 1652.159
realizing that there is no life letter

1650.88 --> 1654.3990000000001
debates

1652.159 --> 1656.72
for today and probably not tomorrow

1654.399 --> 1656.7199999999998
either

1658.0 --> 1663.039
i am here available

1660.159 --> 1664.5590000000002
now a little less worried

1663.039 --> 1667.36
what

1664.559 --> 1671.279
you too drunken bullet oh wow

1667.36 --> 1671.279

wow

1674.72 --> 1678.3990000000001
thank you so much man that's

1680.24 --> 1685.679
ironically enough yeah i was running out

1682.64 --> 1686.7990000000002
of coffee i had actually set for today

1685.679 --> 1688.72
to get it

1686.799 --> 1690.559
but get it was getting word yeah but if

1688.72 --> 1692.3990000000001
i get it today that means i'm not going

1690.559 --> 1694.32
to be able to pay rent

1692.399 --> 1697.84
right that sort of [ __ ] was balancing

1694.32 --> 1699.84
out in my head i will now just buy

1697.84 --> 1702.72
coffee with that

1699.84 --> 1702.72
thank you very much

1702.799 --> 1707.399
we'll be the coffee for the next month

1712.559 --> 1715.9189999999999
thank you so much you guys

1721.84 --> 1728.32
two or three hours a day what what

1724.88 --> 1728.3200000000002
are you talking about good servant

1733.6 --> 1739.4399999999998
and what mask and gun

1736.159 --> 1741.3600000000001
tiller what

1739.44 --> 1742.48
yeah you did chuck a lot at me by the

1741.36 --> 1746.32
way

1742.48 --> 1751.72
like i'll just say 100 euros

1746.32 --> 1751.72
and dank also gave me a sizeable amount

1756.159 --> 1759.7600000000002
and so the drunken bullet that was

1757.919 --> 1764.279
pretty big donation man i really

1759.76 --> 1764.279
appreciate that i really do

1770.96 --> 1775.039
you're just a bum no good servant no

1773.2 --> 1778.559
you're not

1775.039 --> 1781.52
no and by the way i'd like to remind you

1778.559 --> 1785.84
and everybody else that good servant

1781.52 --> 1785.84
in times when it was kind of teachering

1786.08 --> 1790.399
he just kept sending me like

1789.44 --> 1791.8400000000001
two

1790.399 --> 1793.36
five

1791.84 --> 1795.279
dollars

1793.36 --> 1797.6789999999999
like almost daily

1795.279 --> 1799.84
and he's done that like a lot of times

1797.679 --> 1801.679
so i'm not forgetting that that also

1799.84 --> 1803.6
helped a lot

1801.679 --> 1806.8400000000001
good servant and i really appreciate you

1803.6 --> 1806.84
did that

1810.399 --> 1814.559
and i know like you're financially tied

1812.799 --> 1816.48
to so that's like

1814.559 --> 1819.279
let's be honest

1816.48 --> 1823.799
if i were in your situation

1819.279 --> 1823.799
i would have probably not done that

1826.48 --> 1830.799
and that kind of gives me the feeling

1828.559 --> 1835.08
like i i don't i'm not sure if i'm

1830.799 --> 1835.08
actually worthy of all this

1840.399 --> 1843.6
so yeah i'm not forgetting that you did

1842.08 --> 1847.279
that good servant

1843.6 --> 1847.279
i may be in a little bit of a

1847.44 --> 1853.8400000000001
principle conflict with you

1850.64 --> 1855.76
of what happened a week ago

1853.84 --> 1857.519
you know that

1855.76 --> 1859.279
but i'm not forgetting that it's not

1857.519 --> 1861.44
like you lost you

1859.279 --> 1863.44
because of that situation i'm gonna go

1861.44 --> 1866.3200000000002
throw away all your credit

1863.44 --> 1866.3200000000002
that you've earned

1866.72 --> 1870.96
don't worry about that

1869.12 --> 1873.76
but i'm not i'm not visiting your

1870.96 --> 1873.76
streams though

1874.399 --> 1879.0
not until the issue is resolved

1879.519 --> 1883.6
and i get the feeling it won't because

1881.679 --> 1885.3600000000001
there's people in there that are

1883.6 --> 1888.33
literally

1885.36 --> 1889.76
keeping and holding you to that

1888.33 --> 1893.519
[Music]

1889.76 --> 1896.0
and that disappoints me

1893.519 --> 1896.0
anyway

1897.039 --> 1903.76
we hope where we can yeah thank you i i

1900.0 --> 1903.76
really appreciate it you guys

1904.799 --> 1909.36
you guys are what are keeping me going

1907.44 --> 1911.679
it's real

1909.36 --> 1914.559
that is real that's not my gig that's

1911.679 --> 1914.5590000000002
not my stick

1915.2 --> 1920.24
this is the condition for how this show

1917.679 --> 1922.159
works

1920.24 --> 1925.44
and you

1922.159 --> 1928.72
have held up your ends

1925.44 --> 1931.2
or as owen benjamin would call it in

1928.72 --> 1934.76
this current time period you've proven

1931.2 --> 1934.76
you're not gay

1945.919 --> 1950.64
but i'm not gonna make that my way of

1948.72 --> 1952.96
expressing it

1950.64 --> 1955.6000000000001
but i thought it was funny though

1952.96 --> 1957.039
bit transparent but still funny

1955.6 --> 1960.4399999999998
anyway

1957.039 --> 1960.44
oh man

1972.64 --> 1977.2
ah man

1974.24 --> 1979.44
my keyboard is having issues by the way

1977.2 --> 1982.0
but it's not surprising because for some

1979.44 --> 1985.919
freaking reason in the last week

1982.0 --> 1987.76
i've spilled over a beer

1985.919 --> 1991.3600000000001
t

1987.76 --> 1994.0
like three times tea and even water and

1991.36 --> 1998.7199999999998
like for some reason i keep bumping over

1994.0 --> 1998.72
[ __ ] making a watery ballad out of this

2000.08 --> 2006.1589999999999
out of my desk here luckily not

2003.12 --> 2010.1589999999999
getting any short circuits or anything

2006.159 --> 2010.159
but now my keyboard is kind of like

2010.72 --> 2016.08
some keys are giving me a hard time

2014.399 --> 2017.76
but it'll go away because it's not the

2016.08 --> 2021.279
first time that happened like these

2017.76 --> 2021.279
keyboards are incredible

2022.88 --> 2026.5590000000002
yeah

2024.08 --> 2029.1999999999998
daily use

2026.559 --> 2031.039
for what how old are they they're like

2029.2 --> 2033.76
30 years old

2031.039 --> 2036.32
seriously some of these keyboards are

2033.76 --> 2038.559
younger than the people that watch this

2036.32 --> 2038.559
show

2038.72 --> 2041.679
can you imagine that

2042.08 --> 2047.84
these keyboards are older than all of my

2045.2 --> 2047.8400000000001
roommates

2048.32 --> 2053.679
but they still work

2050.56 --> 2053.679
hope you donate what

2054.8 --> 2059.639
what you

2055.919 --> 2059.6389999999997
you donated more

2060.48 --> 2063.679
or wait what

2064.48 --> 2066.96
holy [ __ ]

2065.839 --> 2071.2799999999997
no

2066.96 --> 2071.28
no i i did receive it i think

2072.879 --> 2075.7599999999998
not sure though

2080.0 --> 2084.079
wait

2082.0 --> 2086.56
no i don't think so not yet i'm not

2084.079 --> 2089.8390000000004
seeing it i got from drunken bullet tony

2086.56 --> 2089.839
whitcomb and dank

2092.48 --> 2096.56
if you're sending some it hasn't arrived

2094.32 --> 2096.56
yet

2098.64 --> 2105.2799999999997
read your previous text

2100.88 --> 2105.28
i'll be eating mexican cockroach yeah

2107.92 --> 2110.7200000000003
leaf wraps

2112.079 --> 2118.7200000000003
dude you didn't just donate your

2115.68 --> 2118.72
food money right

2120.0 --> 2125.2
i hope you're joking you must be joking

2122.96 --> 2125.92
that would be crazy

2125.2 --> 2128.56
but

2125.92 --> 2131.56
yeah i really appreciate it hey julia

2128.56 --> 2131.56
pavin

2133.2 --> 2135.9199999999996
good to see you

2137.92 --> 2141.2000000000003
mexican cook yeah

2142.079 --> 2147.32
it's a joke good thank god

2154.35 --> 2161.0789999999997
[Music]

2158.079 --> 2161.079
um

2179.839 --> 2182.839
hmm

2190.079 --> 2194.7200000000003
it's

2191.68 --> 2194.72
it's so weird

2195.599 --> 2199.92
because like

2197.359 --> 2202.16
i was ready to do the show but as i said

2199.92 --> 2204.64
i wasn't weak i was weakened

2202.16 --> 2206.0789999999997
because there was tension

2204.64 --> 2208.56
that it was just

2206.079 --> 2210.96
was taking up a lot of energy to keep it

2208.56 --> 2212.96
out of my focus right because i don't

2210.96 --> 2215.839
want to squirt oh yeah

2212.96 --> 2218.079
that's completely useless for a show

2215.839 --> 2218.0789999999997
right

2218.96 --> 2224.079
but then i end up just kind of having

2221.04 --> 2226.8
tense moments and

2224.079 --> 2230.2400000000002
being silent instead

2226.8 --> 2231.6800000000003
and now with with your you guys

2230.24 --> 2233.1189999999997
helping me out

2231.68 --> 2235.04
sizably

2233.119 --> 2237.28
it's literally like this layer of

2235.04 --> 2239.359
tension first it just started bubbling

2237.28 --> 2242.1600000000003
and now it's kind of like drifted off

2239.359 --> 2244.7999999999997
and i got extra room

2242.16 --> 2247.7599999999998
slowing better

2244.8 --> 2250.0
i i literally feel i can perform better

2247.76 --> 2250.0
now

2250.4 --> 2253.11
spirits lifted

2252.72 --> 2254.8799999999997
yeah

2253.11 --> 2256.56
[Music]

2254.88 --> 2258.56
worries lifted

2256.56 --> 2260.72
short-term worries right long-term

2258.56 --> 2262.0
worries is one thing you know i always

2260.72 --> 2265.2
have them

2262.0 --> 2268.16
because i worry about worldly things

2265.2 --> 2271.64
that even that don't in a direct sense

2268.16 --> 2271.64
involve me

2273.359 --> 2278.7999999999997
but i have to keep worrying about those

2276.0 --> 2281.119
because if i don't

2278.8 --> 2281.119
then

2282.0 --> 2289.359
i'll eventually end up in a place

2285.2 --> 2289.359
where they will have become my worries

2290.8 --> 2295.04
and then there's no escape

2292.8 --> 2298.2400000000002
right anyway

2295.04 --> 2299.44
that's a little vague probably

2298.24 --> 2300.72
yeah

2299.44 --> 2302.96
i don't know

2300.72 --> 2302.9599999999996
but

2303.52 --> 2306.24
what is this

2310.64 --> 2317.839
is that something that happened clearly

2314.4 --> 2319.839
is that why tony brought it up

2317.839 --> 2321.839
it's like actually a contest at that

2319.839 --> 2324.839
that's really

2321.839 --> 2324.839
revolting

2326.88 --> 2330.1600000000003
over vaulting

2328.24 --> 2331.9199999999996
no it's not revolting

2330.16 --> 2334.24
you're not going to go into a revolt

2331.92 --> 2336.2400000000002
over it no but it is repulsive that's

2334.24 --> 2337.839
the right word i think

2336.24 --> 2340.72
yuck

2337.839 --> 2342.64
although i don't know maybe

2340.72 --> 2344.16
they are halfway

2342.64 --> 2346.24
nutritious

2344.16 --> 2347.2799999999997
i guess it all depends on what they are

2346.24 --> 2349.1189999999997
eating

2347.28 --> 2352.88
like i hope you're not

2349.119 --> 2352.88
getting the roaches from uh

2353.28 --> 2356.8
from a trash heap or anything like

2355.119 --> 2359.52
because they are going to be filled with

2356.8 --> 2361.76
garbage literally

2359.52 --> 2364.32
and disgusting stuff

2361.76 --> 2365.599
but i think that technically if you bred

2364.32 --> 2367.76
them

2365.599 --> 2369.2000000000003
like literally farm them and gave them

2367.76 --> 2370.7200000000003
decent

2369.2 --> 2373.1189999999997
stuff to eat

2370.72 --> 2374.8799999999997
might actually be kind of

2373.119 --> 2379.2000000000003
doable

2374.88 --> 2379.2000000000003
not preferable though this yuck

2380.24 --> 2383.839
whatever floats your boat

2384.24 --> 2389.0789999999997
joe's apartment

2386.079 --> 2389.079
what

2402.96 --> 2405.96
so

2411.119 --> 2415.04
i have no idea what you guys talking

2412.88 --> 2416.0
about

2415.04 --> 2418.079
it would

2416.0 --> 2421.76
it would be great by the way because

2418.079 --> 2421.76
this seems to be a bit of a problem

2422.16 --> 2427.52
that

2423.76 --> 2427.5200000000004
it wasn't moving there you go

2428.72 --> 2434.72
all right so there was a movie

2432.0 --> 2435.76
and in there that happened

2434.72 --> 2438.0789999999997
okay

2435.76 --> 2441.119
talking about movies i watched another

2438.079 --> 2444.2400000000002
movie that i downloaded a while ago

2441.119 --> 2447.92
action movie sci-fi sort of

2444.24 --> 2449.4399999999996
time-based sci-fi action movie

2447.92 --> 2452.4
boss level

2449.44 --> 2455.119
also with mel gibson in there it's very

2452.4 --> 2455.119
gruesome

2455.52 --> 2460.72
and at it is slightly well not slight

2458.24 --> 2462.0789999999997
it's pretty dehumanizing in ways because

2460.72 --> 2464.48
it's

2462.079 --> 2466.5600000000004
treating game death and all that like a

2464.48 --> 2468.079
game it is basically the groundhog day

2466.56 --> 2470.0789999999997
setup

2468.079 --> 2474.48
but

2470.079 --> 2476.88
very interestingly developing movie

2474.48 --> 2478.96
and it is a lot about like the conscious

2476.88 --> 2481.359
of the main character

2478.96 --> 2483.68
and it also like it doesn't start up oh

2481.359 --> 2486.0
he suddenly for the first time realizes

2483.68 --> 2487.9199999999996
he's in a time loop no no no

2486.0 --> 2490.0
it starts in the middle of it when he's

2487.92 --> 2491.28
already gone

2490.0 --> 2493.76
going at it

2491.28 --> 2496.48
and he basically narrates

2493.76 --> 2498.96
that and how it is what it's like it

2496.48 --> 2500.64
and that's interesting

2498.96 --> 2504.079
that the main character is also

2500.64 --> 2504.0789999999997
narrating to the viewer

2504.16 --> 2508.3999999999996
it works it works really well for this

2506.48 --> 2510.64
movie i thought it was an interesting

2508.4 --> 2510.64
one

2511.119 --> 2515.44
and but it is just really slice and dice

2514.319 --> 2516.56
action

2515.44 --> 2521.0
type

2516.56 --> 2521.0
very bloody very bloody

2523.04 --> 2526.64
or well maybe blood is a big word

2525.28 --> 2529.3590000000004
there's not like

2526.64 --> 2531.52
blood splattering all over the place but

2529.359 --> 2533.44
yeah there is like dismemberment and

2531.52 --> 2534.88
[ __ ] constantly

2533.44 --> 2537.28
and

2534.88 --> 2539.76
that was a little disgusting but other

2537.28 --> 2542.079
than that like how it was it was

2539.76 --> 2544.8
constructed like a video game

2542.079 --> 2548.1600000000003
it and it did remind me literally

2544.8 --> 2551.44
watching that movie

2548.16 --> 2554.16
made me want to play baldur's gate again

2551.44 --> 2556.88
because that is how you play baldur's

2554.16 --> 2558.96
gate it's like oh you need to figure out

2556.88 --> 2560.6400000000003
what you're going to find there because

2558.96 --> 2564.0
if you're not prepared you're very

2560.64 --> 2567.5989999999997
likely you're going to die

2564.0 --> 2569.92
if you do know what you have to be aware

2567.599 --> 2572.56
of what's gonna happen in that game it's

2569.92 --> 2575.359
like you have to cheat or it won't work

2572.56 --> 2577.44
properly you just perish quickly when

2575.359 --> 2579.68
you play it the first time

2577.44 --> 2582.0
you're constantly like oh i'm gonna go

2579.68 --> 2585.359
there at it ah and then yeah you get

2582.0 --> 2588.56
completely splattered because you didn't

2585.359 --> 2590.72
prepare exactly what you needed to

2588.56 --> 2593.92
confront what you would be facing

2590.72 --> 2596.8799999999997
and this movie

2593.92 --> 2600.64
does that has that effect and that's why

2596.88 --> 2600.6400000000003
it is so much like a video game

2602.96 --> 2609.119
anyway if you haven't seen it it's from

2604.96 --> 2609.119
2020 and it is a good movie

2613.839 --> 2620.68
did you see kiwis show her drop super

2616.64 --> 2620.68
chat that he messed it up

2628.96 --> 2632.599
you mean tuesday

2635.44 --> 2640.8
yeah it was kind of messy tuesday show i

2638.4 --> 2644.359
was only there in chat anyway

2640.8 --> 2644.3590000000004
it was really distracted

2652.319 --> 2658.319
yeah drunken bullet for one boss level

2654.8 --> 2659.8390000000004
is like a good movie but it is

2658.319 --> 2661.2
it is like

2659.839 --> 2662.72
carnage

2661.2 --> 2665.4399999999996
lots of death

2662.72 --> 2666.8799999999997
it like it it has a touch of death to it

2665.44 --> 2668.88
and that

2666.88 --> 2672.4
and like the dehumanizing like oh yeah

2668.88 --> 2676.76
well it's death because of the situation

2672.4 --> 2676.76
it's the context but it is

2677.119 --> 2682.079
it is not super healthy it is not super

2679.68 --> 2683.04
moral

2682.079 --> 2685.8390000000004
right

2683.04 --> 2688.72
but it is a good movie nonetheless

2685.839 --> 2693.7599999999998
but yeah definitely not something

2688.72 --> 2696.24
you should you should show kids

2693.76 --> 2696.2400000000002
i think

2698.4 --> 2702.8
but they'll probably end up watching it

2700.4 --> 2702.8
anyway

2703.119 --> 2705.839
like

2709.839 --> 2716.839
in many ways the game is directed at

2712.319 --> 2716.839
gamers that have desensitization

2719.04 --> 2722.64
because it is really about

2721.04 --> 2724.319
that system

2722.64 --> 2727.44
a game system

2724.319 --> 2730.48
as i compared it to baldur's gate how i

2727.44 --> 2732.4
played that and i've played that game

2730.48 --> 2733.68
hundreds of times

2732.4 --> 2735.52
which

2733.68 --> 2738.7999999999997
weirdly matches

2735.52 --> 2741.839
how he goes about in the cycle

2738.8 --> 2744.1600000000003
as in how i play with for knowledge the

2741.839 --> 2747.359
game so yeah

2744.16 --> 2750.359
i really got that feeling from it

2747.359 --> 2750.359
anyway

2752.48 --> 2755.61
[Music]

2761.839 --> 2765.839
is nathan still on walkabot

2764.48 --> 2767.599
yeah

2765.839 --> 2770.56
he's still on holiday

2767.599 --> 2774.2400000000002
i don't expect him to

2770.56 --> 2777.2
to do a live show today either

2774.24 --> 2777.2
hey amanda young

2782.16 --> 2787.7999999999997
i don't know jordy roses george sanford

2804.96 --> 2808.839
a seeking style water

2828.319 --> 2831.319
hmm

2848.8 --> 2854.2400000000002
hey hey that flat fellow thanks for the

2851.52 --> 2855.839
99 cents for chad donation

2854.24 --> 2857.7599999999998
see you in a while i haven't seen you in

2855.839 --> 2860.24
a while

2857.76 --> 2860.2400000000002
you doing

2867.44 --> 2873.28
you might wanna listen

2870.079 --> 2876.0
explains a lot of what is happening wow

2873.28 --> 2878.3190000000004
that's the vaguest thing i've ever heard

2876.0 --> 2879.52
george sanford

2878.319 --> 2884.079
i mean

2879.52 --> 2888.559
you can't get more in detail than

2884.079 --> 2888.559
of what is happening you know

2891.359 --> 2894.0789999999997
yeah that's

2892.319 --> 2897.44
sarcasm but

2894.079 --> 2901.1600000000003
was on vacation back now all right

2897.44 --> 2901.16
i hope it was nice

2901.28 --> 2905.76
hope you had a a good relaxing time

2908.88 --> 2914.28
you can't explain here why not

2921.2 --> 2927.3999999999996
what you can't explain what you

2923.119 --> 2927.4
understand about it so far

2931.76 --> 2937.6800000000003
[Music]

2935.04 --> 2937.68
too much

2939.28 --> 2943.8390000000004
[Music]

2940.88 --> 2943.839
too much what

2959.599 --> 2965.0
you can link the journey right sure sure

2961.76 --> 2965.0
do it

2971.2 --> 2977.9199999999996
info to type

2973.76 --> 2977.92
oh so it's super scattered then

2979.76 --> 2986.8
i mean if there is a universal point

2984.0 --> 2989.119
or there are distinct elements that are

2986.8 --> 2990.8
very critical and that would

2989.119 --> 2992.8
direct

2990.8 --> 2997.04
understanding

2992.8 --> 3001.119
but can't you just name the keywords

2997.04 --> 3001.119
and then maybe start elaborating right

3002.319 --> 3007.2799999999997
usually when people can't summarize it

3005.119 --> 3011.559
shortly that's a sign to me that they

3007.28 --> 3011.559
don't really understand it

3024.4 --> 3030.0
i mean is it about the ai dynamics

3028.0 --> 3031.839
about how it

3030.0 --> 3033.92
directs things

3031.839 --> 3037.839
from a neutral vantage point and it's

3033.92 --> 3037.839
just about action reaction

3038.48 --> 3043.68
and

3040.96 --> 3046.48
like basically just categorizing all

3043.68 --> 3049.5989999999997
human responses and feelings and then

3046.48 --> 3052.4
building with that because yeah

3049.599 --> 3054.8
see that that's how you summarize an

3052.4 --> 3057.44
overarching giant thing

3054.8 --> 3059.52
see it's not that hard like i don't even

3057.44 --> 3061.92
know what you're talking about

3059.52 --> 3064.559
but i had a suspicion

3061.92 --> 3068.64
and if ai is involved and it's so

3064.559 --> 3068.6400000000003
mind-blowing it's probably that

3086.079 --> 3088.96
a d wave

3090.319 --> 3096.8
i remember something about d wave

3093.2 --> 3099.2799999999997
it's it's not like super recent d-wave

3096.8 --> 3103.04
computing has been around for a

3099.28 --> 3103.0400000000004
decade or something i think

3103.599 --> 3108.7200000000003
and what it does is basically just

3106.44 --> 3110.7200000000003
statisticalized predictions to

3108.72 --> 3114.0
perfection based on

3110.72 --> 3115.2
neutral vantage point oversight over all

3114.0 --> 3117.52
actions

3115.2 --> 3122.2799999999997
that people take

3117.52 --> 3122.28
it's it's a statistics power

3124.079 --> 3126.48
i right

3129.599 --> 3134.2400000000002
dude i was into

3132.0 --> 3137.119
or well i actually

3134.24 --> 3140.4799999999996
hung around with people that were

3137.119 --> 3142.7200000000003
literal ai programming

3140.48 --> 3142.72
and

3143.04 --> 3147.44
also

3144.64 --> 3149.52
uh what is it what was it called again

3147.44 --> 3152.52
human behavioral study through

3149.52 --> 3152.52
statistics

3152.559 --> 3159.92
behavioral psychology i i hung around

3155.52 --> 3162.8
with those people like in my teens

3159.92 --> 3162.8
and after that

3163.2 --> 3167.52
so

3164.16 --> 3168.96
i had some early insights because of

3167.52 --> 3171.839
them

3168.96 --> 3175.04
because i did back then exactly the same

3171.839 --> 3176.96
thing as i do it now it's just like hey

3175.04 --> 3181.04
something interesting

3176.96 --> 3183.68
share me your expert view

3181.04 --> 3185.04
and expect me to understand it

3183.68 --> 3187.1189999999997
explain it

3185.04 --> 3190.16
like the expert you are don't try to

3187.119 --> 3192.8
play it down for me and then i can kind

3190.16 --> 3194.96
of like assimilate

3192.8 --> 3197.599
expert knowledge even though i don't

3194.96 --> 3198.96
have the foundations built up to

3197.599 --> 3201.119
understand it

3198.96 --> 3206.599
eventually i will

3201.119 --> 3206.599
it's my irwinian d-wave computing

3213.52 --> 3219.88
demon do you wave deep no

3216.4 --> 3219.88
if you're at stanford

3232.16 --> 3238.72
what is my opinion on simulation theory

3235.04 --> 3238.72
or what simulation theory

3239.2 --> 3244.16
depends on who is

3241.68 --> 3247.72
who's postulating it

3244.16 --> 3247.72
that flat fellow

3273.04 --> 3276.04
do

3282.72 --> 3288.799
that this world is a simulation

3286.559 --> 3290.2400000000002
in what context

3288.799 --> 3292.96
i mean

3290.24 --> 3295.5989999999997
i've been saying for

3292.96 --> 3297.599
almost a half a decade now

3295.599 --> 3300.0
yeah i have a big suspicion that this

3297.599 --> 3304.48
realm is simulatory

3300.0 --> 3307.839
yeah literally had to conjure a new ward

3304.48 --> 3307.839
that doesn't exist

3308.96 --> 3313.839
in order to try to explain it

3311.68 --> 3316.8799999999997
because i don't think that this this

3313.839 --> 3319.04
physical realm is a literal simulation

3316.88 --> 3320.559
as in a

3319.04 --> 3323.2
sub-reality

3320.559 --> 3325.52
to an actual reality

3323.2 --> 3329.2799999999997
but i do think that the way it is

3325.52 --> 3331.44
designed is simulatory in nature as if

3329.28 --> 3333.76
it were a simulation it's just not a

3331.44 --> 3338.0
simulation of something

3333.76 --> 3342.3590000000004
it is the the simulation

3338.0 --> 3342.359
that's what i've said about it

3366.48 --> 3372.72
yeah that's right cbs

3369.599 --> 3373.599
and that's why that's specifically

3372.72 --> 3376.5589999999997
why

3373.599 --> 3378.88
i've conjured the word simulatory to

3376.559 --> 3382.079
describe it and do not just blatantly

3378.88 --> 3386.48
assign onto simulation theory because

3382.079 --> 3388.6400000000003
simulation theory plays into nihilism

3386.48 --> 3388.64
and

3388.96 --> 3391.839
this is called again

3392.16 --> 3395.5989999999997
forgot the word

3393.839 --> 3399.04
solipsism

3395.599 --> 3402.559
it plays into that and even like

3399.04 --> 3406.0
liberal trendies that have embraced it

3402.559 --> 3409.44
seem to want to do that with it

3406.0 --> 3409.44
which i do not appreciate

3409.76 --> 3416.1600000000003
is to basically use the knowledge to

3413.44 --> 3419.28
discourage

3416.16 --> 3421.7599999999998
taking grasp

3419.28 --> 3426.0
and that's a bad thing

3421.76 --> 3430.2000000000003
and i oppose that stance always always

3426.0 --> 3430.2
take reality very seriously

3455.119 --> 3459.119
e4 entities

3458.16 --> 3462.0
what

3459.119 --> 3464.0
no but classical homeopath how does that

3462.0 --> 3467.359
compute

3464.0 --> 3469.839
you can't call the robot world an evil

3467.359 --> 3469.839
entity

3471.28 --> 3476.079
they

3473.52 --> 3476.079
have no

3478.96 --> 3482.64
grasp on morality they're just keeping

3481.599 --> 3484.079
order

3482.64 --> 3488.319
they're just doing what they're

3484.079 --> 3490.96
programmed to do it's the machine world

3488.319 --> 3492.319
they're not evil

3490.96 --> 3493.839
they're just

3492.319 --> 3495.119
an opponent

3493.839 --> 3496.96
to the

3495.119 --> 3498.88
humanity

3496.96 --> 3503.079
to the awakened humanity

3498.88 --> 3503.079
i don't see it as evil

3503.119 --> 3505.92
right even

3506.4 --> 3512.4
agent smith is technically not evil he

3509.28 --> 3514.2400000000002
is just obsessed and driven

3512.4 --> 3518.319
and repulsed

3514.24 --> 3518.319
right that's his experience

3519.28 --> 3526.559
like he is not human he is a program

3523.52 --> 3529.359
you can't just say he is evil

3526.559 --> 3534.1600000000003
he's a very dangerous opponent

3529.359 --> 3534.16
but is he evil no he is a program

3542.799 --> 3547.68
matrix movies aren't considered

3544.64 --> 3547.68
documentaries ah

3548.559 --> 3553.119
but there's still a lot to be learned

3550.319 --> 3553.119
from them i think

3554.16 --> 3559.44
it's a it's a good

3556.0 --> 3561.52
perhaps important story to reflect upon

3559.44 --> 3562.88
especially in a certain

3561.52 --> 3564.799
phase where you

3562.88 --> 3567.6800000000003
you are really dealing with trying to

3564.799 --> 3569.359
reflect your consciousness like to

3567.68 --> 3571.04
understand yourself and understand

3569.359 --> 3572.72
reality it's

3571.04 --> 3573.7599999999998
it's very helpful

3572.72 --> 3576.16
for that

3573.76 --> 3579.7990000000004
it can be

3576.16 --> 3579.799
under the right guidance

3593.839 --> 3600.599
perceives a narrow band of vibration

3597.119 --> 3600.599
speak for yourself

3600.72 --> 3605.839
i think i don't see a narrow band of

3603.04 --> 3608.319
vibration i think i see

3605.839 --> 3611.2
a very big chunk of it here's the thing

3608.319 --> 3613.2799999999997
though the more you see the more strain

3611.2 --> 3615.2
you receive from it

3613.28 --> 3616.3190000000004
on your spirit

3615.2 --> 3617.9199999999996
right

3616.319 --> 3619.68
why do people

3617.92 --> 3622.319
narrow their minds

3619.68 --> 3624.64
it is to defend themselves from the

3622.319 --> 3626.72
strain of actually

3624.64 --> 3628.799
having their spirit touch upon it and

3626.72 --> 3630.72
assimilate it

3628.799 --> 3633.44
that's the reason why they do it it's an

3630.72 --> 3635.839
instinct to prevent their spirit from

3633.44 --> 3637.359
exploding getting erratic or

3635.839 --> 3639.52
self-destructive

3637.359 --> 3642.16
right it's a defense mechanism ignorance

3639.52 --> 3643.92
in a way is a defense mechanism it

3642.16 --> 3645.68
becomes a real problem when you

3643.92 --> 3647.119
weaponize it

3645.68 --> 3649.1189999999997
that's when you get

3647.119 --> 3650.96
it becomes problematic if you don't

3649.119 --> 3653.119
weaponize it

3650.96 --> 3655.2
then having that response is perfectly

3653.119 --> 3658.1600000000003
natural it just means

3655.2 --> 3659.68
okay this person is not ready for this

3658.16 --> 3661.44
they need time

3659.68 --> 3665.0
think about it

3661.44 --> 3665.0
and then choose

3678.4 --> 3682.799
right pj crew shank well what what does

3680.72 --> 3685.2
that stand for i know the way he said it

3682.799 --> 3687.68
is very dramatic and again he is the

3685.2 --> 3690.64
opponent and he is intimidating he is

3687.68 --> 3691.9199999999996
effective at being an agent

3690.64 --> 3693.1189999999997
right

3691.92 --> 3695.04
but

3693.119 --> 3697.04
all of those things that he described

3695.04 --> 3699.359
you can taste your smell and fear

3697.04 --> 3701.92
somehow you've infected me you know why

3699.359 --> 3705.2799999999997
that is because

3701.92 --> 3706.48
he is as a program routine suffering

3705.28 --> 3710.0
under the

3706.48 --> 3710.0
becoming your opponent

3710.079 --> 3713.44
effect

3711.44 --> 3716.2400000000002
right if you fight the demons long

3713.44 --> 3718.319
enough you become the demons that saying

3716.24 --> 3721.1189999999997
well he is

3718.319 --> 3723.68
perceiving focusing everything on

3721.119 --> 3726.559
defeating his opponent

3723.68 --> 3729.2799999999997
and thereby it gets so up close it's so

3726.559 --> 3731.6800000000003
in his face that it is repulsive because

3729.28 --> 3733.8390000000004
it's still his opponent he

3731.68 --> 3736.8799999999997
he's studying it

3733.839 --> 3738.5589999999997
he's perfecting his skills as a program

3736.88 --> 3742.559
again to

3738.559 --> 3745.2000000000003
to contain to execute to get it under

3742.559 --> 3748.2400000000002
control but because it's so close up

3745.2 --> 3748.24
he's starting to

3749.599 --> 3754.7200000000003
like have this entire

3751.92 --> 3757.119
image of his opponent an icon and he

3754.72 --> 3760.16
feels like it's becoming and he

3757.119 --> 3762.0
fears worshipping

3760.16 --> 3764.3999999999996
the enemy

3762.0 --> 3766.72
fearing it's becoming him

3764.4 --> 3766.7200000000003
huh

3766.839 --> 3772.68
psychology ever thought about it like

3769.039 --> 3772.6800000000003
that have you

3785.92 --> 3791.6800000000003
i don't think agent smith is evil

3788.4 --> 3794.079
he's a very scary opponent though

3791.68 --> 3797.72
and the actor is great he did such a

3794.079 --> 3797.7200000000003
good role for him

3808.96 --> 3814.0
right and eventually

3811.68 --> 3815.1189999999997
his obsession with defeating the

3814.0 --> 3818.4
opponent

3815.119 --> 3819.92
which becomes uh becomes uh neo

3818.4 --> 3822.079
exclusively

3819.92 --> 3824.4
he does become reckless he does become

3822.079 --> 3826.319
demonic at the sense that he

3824.4 --> 3828.1600000000003
obsesses and then he just doesn't give a

3826.319 --> 3830.48
[ __ ] about any

3828.16 --> 3832.72
about the actual order keeping he just

3830.48 --> 3834.319
starts to assimilate everybody copy

3832.72 --> 3835.9199999999996
himself

3834.319 --> 3837.599
he just doesn't care anymore so

3835.92 --> 3839.92
eventually he

3837.599 --> 3841.6800000000003
does become demonic through his

3839.92 --> 3846.119
obsession

3841.68 --> 3846.1189999999997
but he doesn't start out like that

3868.079 --> 3872.1600000000003
what do you guys think

3869.76 --> 3873.119
about what i just explained about agent

3872.16 --> 3875.7599999999998
smith

3873.119 --> 3879.1600000000003
have you ever considered thinking about

3875.76 --> 3879.1600000000003
it like that

3894.24 --> 3898.1189999999997
i'll be back two minutes

3919.76 --> 3922.76
so

3959.52 --> 3962.52
yep

3974.559 --> 3977.559
what

3985.839 --> 3988.4
oh my

3991.599 --> 3995.7200000000003
i god so much better

4013.28 --> 4018.48
when he's

4014.4 --> 4018.48
when he got the foresight

4019.2 --> 4022.64
what do you mean pg christian

4023.119 --> 4027.839
now he started to become reckless as

4025.52 --> 4032.4
soon as he understood

4027.839 --> 4034.4
that neo broke him away from his purpose

4032.4 --> 4036.079
like he couldn't function like an agent

4034.4 --> 4038.48
anymore

4036.079 --> 4039.52
it was supposed to return to the source

4038.48 --> 4040.96
but then

4039.52 --> 4043.92
yeah he

4040.96 --> 4046.799
became reprogrammed and obsessed with

4043.92 --> 4048.799
neo and then he basically lost his agent

4046.799 --> 4052.24
function in the process

4048.799 --> 4052.24
becoming a rogue agent

4054.72 --> 4059.7599999999998
because what neo did

4057.599 --> 4060.96
breaking through the matrix entering him

4059.76 --> 4064.48
and then

4060.96 --> 4067.44
yeah destroying not the the vessel but

4064.48 --> 4069.68
the actual program spirit that is agent

4067.44 --> 4070.48
smith

4069.68 --> 4073.2
that

4070.48 --> 4075.359
yeah that changed it as agent smith

4073.2 --> 4077.839
described it something was like

4075.359 --> 4080.0
overwritten

4077.839 --> 4080.0
just

4080.96 --> 4089.039
when he assimilated the oracle

4084.319 --> 4091.92
well he was already gone before that

4089.039 --> 4094.88
it's just that the oracle

4091.92 --> 4097.279
basically by assimilating him he could

4094.88 --> 4099.839
no longer escape

4097.279 --> 4102.96
what he is

4099.839 --> 4106.4
like because the oracle is aware and

4102.96 --> 4108.08
gave him like the full awareness of

4106.4 --> 4110.719
what's going on

4108.08 --> 4112.799
and then he's like stuck where the there

4110.719 --> 4114.719
there's only one thing left for him

4112.799 --> 4117.359
after that point and that is

4114.719 --> 4117.359
to end it

4117.6 --> 4122.08
right it took away the mysteries

4120.319 --> 4125.120000000001
everything else he became even more

4122.08 --> 4125.12
obsessed after that

4129.6 --> 4134.64
smith was the devil no no he wasn't

4135.359 --> 4144.04
no he was a broken rogue program

4140.64 --> 4144.04
not the devil

4150.64 --> 4155.04
i mean he played

4152.64 --> 4158.64
the opponent

4155.04 --> 4161.64
in the play in the situation not the

4158.64 --> 4161.64
devil

4163.839 --> 4167.12
you see it's different

4168.0 --> 4171.92
like smith wasn't in control

4172.319 --> 4178.400000000001
he destroyed everything the devil

4174.56 --> 4178.400000000001
doesn't do it like that

4179.759 --> 4184.56
brokenness demons

4182.08 --> 4184.5599999999995
do that

4184.799 --> 4190.88
he wasn't in control he wasn't there to

4188.319 --> 4194.719
fix anything anymore

4190.88 --> 4195.4400000000005
he was there only to end

4194.719 --> 4200.4
it

4195.44 --> 4200.4
himself by basically assimilating neo

4201.28 --> 4207.88
but it was out of his control

4204.32 --> 4207.88
he couldn't stop

4217.679 --> 4223.36
yeah matthew mitchell i know i know they

4220.4 --> 4226.08
they tried to put it in there

4223.36 --> 4229.08
making it all gnostic and all that

4226.08 --> 4229.08
yeah

4272.96 --> 4277.679
right but yeah there there is a lot

4275.28 --> 4280.88
to the matrix movies

4277.679 --> 4280.88
a lot to ponder on

4281.76 --> 4285.56
and reflect on

4287.199 --> 4292.239
and it's a very

4289.199 --> 4294.799999999999
carefully well-crafted movie where

4292.239 --> 4297.28
especially the

4294.8 --> 4299.04
the purpose and the meaning and the

4297.28 --> 4302.239
drive

4299.04 --> 4304.64
and things like impulses and choices are

4302.239 --> 4307.12
put on the forefront of attention and

4304.64 --> 4309.4400000000005
design for the thing it's a very

4307.12 --> 4311.92
carefully crafted movie

4309.44 --> 4311.919999999999
series

4313.199 --> 4317.12
and then like

4314.8 --> 4320.88
the other half is action

4317.12 --> 4320.88
it's just like action and

4323.92 --> 4329.1990000000005
matrix sci-fi setting a new form of art

4327.04 --> 4331.04
basically at it

4329.199 --> 4333.839999999999
but

4331.04 --> 4336.159
the whole story unrolling

4333.84 --> 4339.8
and the psychology are all very

4336.159 --> 4339.799999999999
carefully crafted

4351.92 --> 4357.84
so what kind of entities are controlling

4355.199 --> 4357.839999999999
this world

4358.88 --> 4362.159000000001
not entities of hope

4363.92 --> 4366.2390000000005
god

4367.84 --> 4372.88
he designed it and it is con

4371.12 --> 4375.28
it is

4372.88 --> 4380.36
making the control and the opposition

4375.28 --> 4380.36
manifest naturally according to design

4384.4 --> 4388.159
right

4385.44 --> 4390.879999999999
in a way it is very much

4388.159 --> 4394.48
like the architect versus the oracle

4390.88 --> 4397.12
now who is who or what is what

4394.48 --> 4399.839999999999
you know that's always the complicated

4397.12 --> 4399.84
question

4423.84 --> 4428.0
meaningless distractions from the real

4425.92 --> 4430.0
conditions of existence or they are the

4428.0 --> 4431.6
reminders of them have you ever thought

4430.0 --> 4433.84
it like about it like that aries the

4431.6 --> 4437.04
cursed man

4433.84 --> 4437.04
ever considered that

4437.28 --> 4441.12
good movies

4439.36 --> 4446.0
can be

4441.12 --> 4446.0
not distractions but instead reminders

4446.08 --> 4450.159
indirect reminders through the patterns

4451.92 --> 4456.4800000000005
of the real

4453.44 --> 4458.799999999999
conditions of existence huh because

4456.48 --> 4460.718999999999
that's what we're doing right now

4458.8 --> 4462.64
getting into the philosophy getting into

4460.719 --> 4463.84
the details right

4462.64 --> 4466.96
is that

4463.84 --> 4469.1990000000005
meaningless distraction from the real

4466.96 --> 4471.12
condition of existence or does it

4469.199 --> 4473.28
actually help strengthen our

4471.12 --> 4475.76
understanding

4473.28 --> 4475.759999999999
of that

4476.32 --> 4482.5599999999995
we have the bible yeah yeah

4479.04 --> 4485.36
oh that's the only thing

4482.56 --> 4485.360000000001
i don't think so

4487.44 --> 4492.159
i mean why would you restrict yourself

4490.239 --> 4495.199
like that i know

4492.159 --> 4497.839999999999
you should know your priorities right

4495.199 --> 4497.839999999999
you know

4500.159 --> 4505.36
like it's not like oh i found something

4502.56 --> 4507.04
better now i'm going to abandon for

4505.36 --> 4509.599999999999
example the bible

4507.04 --> 4511.28
that would be a mistake no

4509.6 --> 4514.2390000000005
don't do that

4511.28 --> 4518.08
but why would you limit yourself

4514.239 --> 4520.08
say only the bible what are you afraid

4518.08 --> 4521.5199999999995
that attaining other

4520.08 --> 4524.719
stories

4521.52 --> 4526.96
will corrupt you

4524.719 --> 4529.36
do you think yourself that weak and

4526.96 --> 4529.36
feeble

4531.6 --> 4538.159000000001
isn't the whole point testing

4535.28 --> 4539.759999999999
wouldn't it be a great test to actually

4538.159 --> 4541.759999999999
read the other

4539.76 --> 4543.679
religious writings and

4541.76 --> 4546.64
all kinds of things

4543.679 --> 4549.12
and reflect upon them

4546.64 --> 4550.8
in order to deepen your understanding of

4549.12 --> 4552.88
reality

4550.8 --> 4555.92
right like wisdom

4552.88 --> 4557.84
wisdom works because there are so many

4555.92 --> 4560.32
reflections there's so many things to

4557.84 --> 4562.88
reference to so many lessons learned

4560.32 --> 4562.88
because

4564.159 --> 4569.44
all together

4565.76 --> 4572.56
it helps you build a more clear picture

4569.44 --> 4573.678999999999
so i i fundamentally disagree with the

4572.56 --> 4575.360000000001
notion

4573.679 --> 4577.84
that you should not

4575.36 --> 4581.159
watch any movies or read any other books

4577.84 --> 4581.159000000001
than the bible

4589.199 --> 4592.4
i

4590.08 --> 4593.5199999999995
think people watch too many move right

4592.4 --> 4595.679
well then

4593.52 --> 4598.159000000001
but then they're just

4595.679 --> 4600.32
guzzling the movie they're not actually

4598.159 --> 4602.719
like

4600.32 --> 4604.5599999999995
studying it right if you watch a movie

4602.719 --> 4607.04
and you don't study it whatsoever you're

4604.56 --> 4609.679
just like oh no i'm gonna

4607.04 --> 4613.36
do drugs or something or

4609.679 --> 4616.0
or completely get wasted and just like

4613.36 --> 4618.08
just watch the movie and be entertained

4616.0 --> 4620.239
and then forget you what it even was

4618.08 --> 4623.84
right yeah that's completely useless

4620.239 --> 4623.839999999999
people do that too

4624.719 --> 4628.4800000000005
but just because some people do that

4626.4 --> 4630.639999999999
doesn't mean that

4628.48 --> 4632.959999999999
you can't do it another way actually

4630.64 --> 4634.2390000000005
watching it with great care and interest

4632.96 --> 4635.92
and

4634.239 --> 4637.919999999999
figuring out what is this what is this

4635.92 --> 4641.04
what am i looking at how is this going

4637.92 --> 4643.1990000000005
to influence different types of people

4641.04 --> 4645.28
on different levels

4643.199 --> 4647.199
in their psyche and spirit how is it

4645.28 --> 4649.92
going to influence them right to

4647.199 --> 4652.32
understand the effects of it this is

4649.92 --> 4655.92
something that i do

4652.32 --> 4655.92
i pay a lot of attention to that

4659.44 --> 4665.199
right and if i notice that

4662.48 --> 4667.599999999999
i'm just like really enthusiastic about

4665.199 --> 4670.879999999999
something and then i might absolutely

4667.6 --> 4673.1990000000005
use it as escaping from reality for a

4670.88 --> 4674.159000000001
moment it's kind of like how i watch

4673.199 --> 4675.678999999999
that

4674.159 --> 4676.5599999999995
atropa

4675.679 --> 4677.84
mini

4676.56 --> 4680.719
movie

4677.84 --> 4683.6
the first time i was just so like whoa

4680.719 --> 4685.6
this is all so new and it was just like

4683.6 --> 4687.52
overwhelmed by sensations in way and i

4685.6 --> 4689.1990000000005
did get a little wasted

4687.52 --> 4691.040000000001
and then

4689.199 --> 4693.919999999999
i'm not very analytical i'm just

4691.04 --> 4697.12
enjoying it but because

4693.92 --> 4699.52
of my own professional interest my own

4697.12 --> 4702.96
psychological studying interest

4699.52 --> 4706.159000000001
i feel i have to watch this again

4702.96 --> 4708.56
and then more with more attention to the

4706.159 --> 4710.96
details and i did

4708.56 --> 4713.1990000000005
right because for me it's more than just

4710.96 --> 4714.8
like oh i just want to see the next

4713.199 --> 4717.44
thing to

4714.8 --> 4719.52
get all enthusiastic and emotional over

4717.44 --> 4722.5599999999995
and and not really

4719.52 --> 4723.360000000001
tackle it intellectually

4722.56 --> 4727.1990000000005
no

4723.36 --> 4729.36
i i only have that sometimes now

4727.199 --> 4732.4
with with a new thing

4729.36 --> 4735.28
i get very like excited and then yeah

4732.4 --> 4738.08
the excitement takes over

4735.28 --> 4739.28
and i pay less attention to the details

4738.08 --> 4740.719
with my intellect because of the

4739.28 --> 4745.239
excitement

4740.719 --> 4745.2390000000005
but that's pretty rare now

4755.92 --> 4761.719
these things are just ice creams

4758.719 --> 4761.719
okay

4770.08 --> 4775.64
worship jesus that's a pretty bizarre

4772.159 --> 4775.639999999999
name by the way

4788.719 --> 4791.84
right any more comments

4824.14 --> 4831.35
[Music]

4841.12 --> 4844.12
hmm

4853.04 --> 4857.44
all right by the way iris cursive man

4855.12 --> 4860.639
what you said earlier which is now like

4857.44 --> 4863.199
15 minutes 70 minutes ago we should

4860.639 --> 4867.4800000000005
moderate everything through christianity

4863.199 --> 4867.48
i think that that's not a good idea

4874.48 --> 4877.199
not like that

4878.08 --> 4881.76
right because

4880.08 --> 4885.04
if you'd say

4881.76 --> 4886.56
moderate everything or filter everything

4885.04 --> 4888.48
through

4886.56 --> 4889.84
very specifically

4888.48 --> 4892.48
jesus

4889.84 --> 4894.719
teachings the esoterics

4892.48 --> 4896.5599999999995
of them if you filter everything through

4894.719 --> 4898.2390000000005
that then i'd say

4896.56 --> 4900.4800000000005
yeah

4898.239 --> 4903.199
that's what i'm trying to do right does

4900.48 --> 4905.919999999999
it mean that i want

4903.199 --> 4908.0
indulge sometimes in things that i

4905.92 --> 4909.12
that i know better about because it's

4908.0 --> 4911.76
hard

4909.12 --> 4912.88
not to sometimes it's a challenge but i

4911.76 --> 4915.12
do

4912.88 --> 4916.96
it's mostly just important to know what

4915.12 --> 4918.719
is what to know

4916.96 --> 4920.56
like no matter what you want in the

4918.719 --> 4921.679
moment this

4920.56 --> 4924.719
is good

4921.679 --> 4924.719
and this is bad

4924.88 --> 4930.719
but you're gonna have to deal with it in

4926.639 --> 4933.76
some way but just to know what is real

4930.719 --> 4936.639
is very important really as a

4933.76 --> 4939.12
as a compass as a spiritual compass

4936.639 --> 4940.2390000000005
so filter through

4939.12 --> 4943.04
jesus

4940.239 --> 4945.12
words teaching specifically i would not

4943.04 --> 4948.32
use the entire bible for that at all i

4945.12 --> 4952.239
mean you can get some great lessons even

4948.32 --> 4955.679
from non-jesus words

4952.239 --> 4959.5599999999995
but i would not use it as a filter

4955.679 --> 4959.56
not the entire thing

4961.04 --> 4965.84
because

4962.639 --> 4968.639
it's very easy to basically fall for the

4965.84 --> 4968.639
the traps

4969.52 --> 4974.8
that are in there that are inherent to

4972.159 --> 4977.199
the others

4974.8 --> 4979.360000000001
that reflect upon jesus and the things

4977.199 --> 4982.0
happening in there

4979.36 --> 4984.159
right you shouldn't take that all as a

4982.0 --> 4987.159
filter because the others make mistakes

4984.159 --> 4987.159
too

4993.679 --> 4998.08
jesus thought it was a great idea what

4998.4 --> 5002.5599999999995
jesus thought what was a great idea to

5000.56 --> 5006.719
filter everything through the new

5002.56 --> 5006.719
testament you say aries curse a man

5006.8 --> 5010.76
is that what you're saying

5020.4 --> 5024.239
because there's a bit of an issue

5025.44 --> 5031.28
you know since

5027.6 --> 5031.280000000001
new testament wasn't written yet

5032.159 --> 5036.44
so is that what he meant

5049.04 --> 5052.96
do you pray do you engage in devotional

5051.36 --> 5057.5599999999995
reading

5052.96 --> 5057.56
do you walk in life as a christian

5064.48 --> 5067.48
what

5083.64 --> 5086.729
[Music]

5110.88 --> 5115.76
christianity is in a way isn't a belief

5113.6 --> 5119.0
it's a way of being well you got to be

5115.76 --> 5122.320000000001
very careful with that right because

5119.0 --> 5125.32
christianity the word and the context of

5122.32 --> 5125.32
it

5126.08 --> 5133.44
there's some other thing out there

5128.88 --> 5133.4400000000005
that's having the similar issues

5134.08 --> 5137.679
you know it as

5136.08 --> 5138.88
science

5137.679 --> 5141.36
yeah

5138.88 --> 5144.56
similar problems

5141.36 --> 5144.5599999999995
do you understand what i mean

5146.88 --> 5151.12
right

5148.8 --> 5154.88
it's very convoluted

5151.12 --> 5157.36
so if you just say christianity

5154.88 --> 5160.32
that can imply multiple things depending

5157.36 --> 5162.0
on the exact

5160.32 --> 5164.5599999999995
context that you

5162.0 --> 5167.04
put along with the word the word alone

5164.56 --> 5170.2390000000005
doesn't encompass

5167.04 --> 5174.92
a singular thing anymore

5170.239 --> 5174.919999999999
it probably never has by the way

5199.199 --> 5204.599999999999
okay hello terry 306 by the way

5229.12 --> 5231.36
what

5232.4 --> 5236.32
hello flat earth radio

5236.48 --> 5240.48
kinsley what did i miss something

5243.199 --> 5249.04
where's ian kinsley i don't see an ian

5245.92 --> 5249.04
kinsley in my chat

5250.159 --> 5253.159
what

5261.92 --> 5266.4
time is the forced man yeah i i step

5264.159 --> 5268.239
away from that notion though right when

5266.4 --> 5269.679
i was saying that type is the fourth

5268.239 --> 5272.718999999999
dimension

5269.679 --> 5276.159
i kind of reified einstein

5272.719 --> 5276.159
dimensional mechanics

5276.239 --> 5281.12
it isn't

5277.679 --> 5283.1990000000005
it's not a dimension

5281.12 --> 5285.44
time isn't a dimension it's not actually

5283.199 --> 5287.5199999999995
a dimension

5285.44 --> 5289.678999999999
not in

5287.52 --> 5293.4400000000005
a

5289.679 --> 5295.52
sense that it should be like a number

5293.44 --> 5299.759999999999
four in a list

5295.52 --> 5299.76
beyond that makes no sense whatsoever

5301.199 --> 5303.759999999999
right it's

5305.36 --> 5312.719
it's just time it's like the other thing

5309.84 --> 5315.76
so there is spatiality and then there is

5312.719 --> 5317.199
time it's the other side it's not one in

5315.76 --> 5320.639
a row

5317.199 --> 5324.0
it's the other element

5320.639 --> 5324.0
and it can be there or not

5324.239 --> 5328.5599999999995
oh as far as we know it can only be

5326.0 --> 5328.56
there so

5330.8 --> 5333.04
what

5333.44 --> 5337.32
the trinity hey

5338.41 --> 5341.67
[Music]

5361.36 --> 5365.0
hey crack villain

5380.719 --> 5383.719
hmm

5396.239 --> 5400.48
wow

5398.48 --> 5403.839999999999
getting a whole bunch of hindu lore

5400.48 --> 5404.799999999999
suddenly roll out in my chat

5403.84 --> 5406.400000000001
all right

5404.8 --> 5409.1990000000005
no objection

5406.4 --> 5409.199
hello agm

5412.32 --> 5415.12
gaining wisdom

5415.679 --> 5418.0
oh

5418.4 --> 5422.5199999999995
so many people in my chest

5441.28 --> 5444.48
where is mount meru

5444.719 --> 5448.04
i don't know

5454.56 --> 5458.400000000001
i mean it's probably in the north

5458.96 --> 5463.44
that's where it's been placed on any

5462.08 --> 5466.32
sort of

5463.44 --> 5466.32
older model

5467.199 --> 5470.159
but i don't know

5468.719 --> 5472.719
like

5470.159 --> 5474.799999999999
yeah i've speculated about rectangular

5472.719 --> 5476.8
looping nature

5474.8 --> 5479.84
it might simply be that the magnetic

5476.8 --> 5481.4400000000005
mountain is currently not within

5479.84 --> 5483.92
loop's reach

5481.44 --> 5486.08
it might simply be cut off

5483.92 --> 5488.32
so when you go there it's just going to

5486.08 --> 5491.679
be an ocean

5488.32 --> 5495.44
and you just loop back

5491.679 --> 5495.4400000000005
on the other side

5500.08 --> 5503.44
right

5501.44 --> 5505.5199999999995
but it might have been there the loop

5503.44 --> 5507.44
might have been completely open at some

5505.52 --> 5509.52
point and then that yeah there might

5507.44 --> 5510.32
have been an actual magnetic mountain

5509.52 --> 5512.4800000000005
there

5510.32 --> 5514.08
it's just not in reach

5512.48 --> 5516.638999999999
currently

5514.08 --> 5518.96
that's a suspicion of mine or

5516.639 --> 5521.52
they have somehow managed to just keep

5518.96 --> 5524.96
it concealed for so long and

5521.52 --> 5526.719
close the map so deeply

5524.96 --> 5528.639
that it is has always been there has

5526.719 --> 5532.4800000000005
always been within reach it's just

5528.639 --> 5534.719
completely and utterly concealed i don't

5532.48 --> 5534.718999999999
know

5535.679 --> 5538.0
or

5536.4 --> 5540.48
who knows maybe

5538.0 --> 5544.56
maybe it freaking sank or something

5540.48 --> 5546.48
maybe it literally is still there

5544.56 --> 5549.4400000000005
at the bottom of the

5546.48 --> 5549.44
arctic ocean

5550.0 --> 5553.56
i don't know man

5563.76 --> 5569.92
the dutch guy you used to talk to in

5566.48 --> 5571.599999999999
hangouts and skype which dutch guy is

5569.92 --> 5573.4400000000005
that

5571.6 --> 5575.84
flat earth radio

5573.44 --> 5575.839999999999
like what

5576.8 --> 5579.92
maybe like atlantis

5580.639 --> 5584.2390000000005
maybe

5581.52 --> 5586.8
it's i'm not saying that magnetic

5584.239 --> 5589.199
mountain is atlantis i think that

5586.8 --> 5591.84
atlantis is the united states

5589.199 --> 5594.96
or rather north america i think that's

5591.84 --> 5594.96
the real atlantis

5598.48 --> 5603.28
like that was always atlantis i think

5601.76 --> 5608.679
and then

5603.28 --> 5608.679
it basically got trashed the most

5618.159 --> 5621.199
but yeah flatter

5620.239 --> 5622.169999999999
oh

5621.199 --> 5625.369
wait

5622.17 --> 5625.369
[Music]

5626.4 --> 5631.92

hands on like this

5638.639 --> 5642.56
google

5640.56 --> 5645.76
like super map and it was completely

5642.56 --> 5650.320000000001
rectangular like the raw data roll out

5645.76 --> 5650.320000000001

5655.52 --> 5659.0
but he's belgium

5664.32 --> 5668.88

5668.88 --> 5671.52
siri

5670.639 --> 5676.36
right

5671.52 --> 5676.360000000001

5689.52 --> 5693.719
what's the other guy's name again

5705.36 --> 5709.599999999999
i'm still subscribed to that guy i think

5707.76 --> 5711.84

5711.84 --> 5716.08
artist

5713.119 --> 5716.08

oh wow

5723.36 --> 5727.08
he still does videos

5737.44 --> 5743.28
yeah it makes a lot of like silly

5740.0 --> 5745.36
flat earth related clips

5743.28 --> 5747.36
right but he was also in the sun and

5745.36 --> 5751.5199999999995
moon group and i pretty much hung around

5747.36 --> 5754.5199999999995

please stop worrying about fed you have

6393.84 --> 6400.639
a crack feeling

6395.679 --> 6404.56
people need their dosage of

6400.639 --> 6406.96
nathan screaming at lunatics

6404.56 --> 6408.0
who refuse to answer questions 20 times

6406.96 --> 6411.8
in a row

6408.0 --> 6411.8
people need that

6417.44 --> 6423.599999999999
paypal needs to verify funds from your

6420.719 --> 6423.6
bankers what

6423.76 --> 6428.719
but george sanford that

6425.84 --> 6432.4800000000005
as far as i know once you have the the

6428.719 --> 6432.4800000000005
bank connection set

6435.36 --> 6440.159
then yeah it shouldn't be any problem

6437.52 --> 6442.4800000000005
and he has successfully sent me some

6440.159 --> 6444.638999999999
a while ago

6442.48 --> 6447.28
so i don't know

6444.639 --> 6449.679
did you check your bank account i mean

6447.28 --> 6451.759999999999
it might be your simply don't have

6449.679 --> 6452.719
anything to donate

6451.76 --> 6456.04
maybe

6452.719 --> 6456.04
i don't know

6459.679 --> 6466.32
sometimes payments just take hours

6462.719 --> 6469.76
take an hour really it takes that long

6466.32 --> 6472.32
okay well i will keep track of it

6469.76 --> 6474.08
throughout the day then and

6472.32 --> 6475.679
yeah as soon as i

6474.08 --> 6477.6
find it's there

6475.679 --> 6479.84
i will give you a shout out probably

6477.6 --> 6483.159000000001
then on tomorrow's show

6479.84 --> 6483.159000000001
if it worked

6484.639 --> 6490.0
is that first ever no really

6488.56 --> 6491.280000000001
but

6490.0 --> 6493.199
i

6491.28 --> 6496.0
remember

6493.199 --> 6498.0
or was that somebody else then

6496.0 --> 6499.679
i thought that matthew mitchell had done

6498.0 --> 6502.639
that

6499.679 --> 6502.639
now i'm confused

6509.52 --> 6512.52
hmm

6513.6 --> 6516.84
oh well

6526.0 --> 6530.159
man

6527.36 --> 6533.599999999999
i'm getting hungry

6530.159 --> 6536.0
now all that stress kind of fell off me

6533.6 --> 6538.400000000001
yeah the side effect is oh relief okay

6536.0 --> 6542.639
that means you get hungry again

6538.4 --> 6545.759999999999
so suddenly now i'm feeling like yeah

6542.639 --> 6547.4400000000005
there's the hunger back

6545.76 --> 6549.679
but that's a good thing

6547.44 --> 6551.5199999999995
it's not like i'm gonna stuff myself

6549.679 --> 6553.76
like a pig

6551.52 --> 6556.2390000000005
with way too much or anything to over

6553.76 --> 6559.04
compensate no no it's just back to

6556.239 --> 6561.598999999999
normal food eating

6559.04 --> 6561.599
balance

6565.44 --> 6569.28
the verification process of the sender's

6567.44 --> 6572.08
account yeah yeah that makes sense

6569.28 --> 6572.08
george sanford

6579.36 --> 6583.44
yeah craft villain

6581.599 --> 6586.4800000000005
can you imagine that

6583.44 --> 6590.638999999999
i'm literally on there and have been for

6586.48 --> 6590.638999999999
like three years or more

6591.44 --> 6596.638999999999
and i've seen it like

6593.36 --> 6600.159
every week for three years and it's

6596.639 --> 6600.159000000001
still like ah

6600.32 --> 6603.199
still wanna hear it

6605.44 --> 6609.638999999999
still wanna be part of it

6613.28 --> 6618.32
even though yeah some limits are kind of

6615.44 --> 6618.32
pushed in there

6618.48 --> 6625.08
that i don't like to i don't like to go

6621.119 --> 6625.08
there on this show

6647.119 --> 6651.5199999999995
ah adam meekin

6649.52 --> 6653.84
that's yeah that is kind of funny isn't

6651.52 --> 6653.84
it

6677.119 --> 6680.119
uh

6680.56 --> 6686.320000000001
right oh crack villain it's a very

6683.28 --> 6689.36
delicate social chemistry that we have

6686.32 --> 6691.5199999999995
and upholds like it is very careful it's

6689.36 --> 6692.719
a very careful group very careful

6691.52 --> 6695.280000000001
process

6692.719 --> 6696.639
and in the past

6695.28 --> 6699.28
like

6696.639 --> 6701.76
there there is disciplining going on

6699.28 --> 6704.32
right nathan does that

6701.76 --> 6707.360000000001
and so do the others

6704.32 --> 6708.4
like we discuss each other's behavior on

6707.36 --> 6711.839999999999
the show

6708.4 --> 6714.32
after the recording stops

6711.84 --> 6716.400000000001
because we all want to contribute in the

6714.32 --> 6718.639
right way we all want to

6716.4 --> 6721.28
make the show fluid

6718.639 --> 6723.04
let everybody have as much time to have

6721.28 --> 6727.5199999999995
their go at it

6723.04 --> 6728.8
and prevent confusion for the audience

6727.52 --> 6731.040000000001
and

6728.8 --> 6736.28
especially prevent

6731.04 --> 6736.28
anybody from getting extra pissed off

6737.44 --> 6741.28
warned you about that whippersnapper

6746.56 --> 6752.400000000001
yeah crack felon you're the newcomer so

6749.199 --> 6752.4
you get the full blame

6752.639 --> 6758.119
it's it's part of the routine i guess

6772.239 --> 6775.239
right

6780.48 --> 6784.959999999999
no i think i think crack film will be an

6783.199 --> 6787.04
okay addition

6784.96 --> 6789.76
but first we kind of have to tame his

6787.04 --> 6791.04
blabber mouth a little because dude you

6789.76 --> 6794.4800000000005
yap on

6791.04 --> 6794.48
like really yap on

6796.96 --> 6802.2390000000005
but you do have interesting ideas and

6799.28 --> 6804.48
points it's just that

6802.239 --> 6806.879999999999
it gets a little long white oh look at

6804.48 --> 6808.879999999999
who's talking i know arwyn complaining

6806.88 --> 6810.88
about somebody else being long-winded

6808.88 --> 6812.719
yes i know

6810.88 --> 6815.679
right

6812.719 --> 6818.56
because i know i do take

6815.679 --> 6820.639
the luxury of pointing it out in others

6818.56 --> 6823.4400000000005
as well

6820.639 --> 6826.0
no it's my fault what

6823.44 --> 6826.0
the [ __ ]

6831.36 --> 6836.719
dude i don't see how it's your fault

6833.52 --> 6836.719
unless you actually

6837.44 --> 6841.04
not

6838.239 --> 6843.28
a joke unless you actually sold nathan

6841.04 --> 6845.04
crack

6843.28 --> 6846.639
unless you did that

6845.04 --> 6849.84
i don't see how you're gonna take the

6846.639 --> 6849.84
blame for this

6856.239 --> 6859.839999999999
it's the eagerness of youth

6858.88 --> 6862.0
this is

6859.84 --> 6864.159000000001
well that's a very positive light to

6862.0 --> 6866.8
shine on it

6864.159 --> 6869.679
you could say that or you could say like

6866.8 --> 6871.599
enthusiasm but it's different you know

6869.679 --> 6874.56
rumpusing and interrupting and wanting

6871.599 --> 6878.400000000001
your point out and rambling on

6874.56 --> 6880.639
that's not necessarily usefulness

6878.4 --> 6882.799999999999
right it's it's the impulses and the

6880.639 --> 6884.96
input and the eagerness that is your

6882.8 --> 6886.08
youthfulness when you're blabber

6884.96 --> 6888.96
mouthing

6886.08 --> 6891.44
it's a different effect it's more like

6888.96 --> 6892.56
oh i feel

6891.44 --> 6893.839999999999
i have

6892.56 --> 6896.320000000001
the moment

6893.84 --> 6898.159000000001
and the respect in order to kind of take

6896.32 --> 6900.159
my time

6898.159 --> 6902.48
so that's actually not so much

6900.159 --> 6905.199
youthfulness it's rather oldiness it's

6902.48 --> 6906.159
like what old people do

6905.199 --> 6907.199
right

6906.159 --> 6909.92
because

6907.199 --> 6911.5199999999995
it feels very rude to just interrupt an

6909.92 --> 6914.2390000000005
old person

6911.52 --> 6917.040000000001
when they are kind of like at their own

6914.239 --> 6918.5599999999995
pace talking for a long time so i

6917.04 --> 6920.48
wouldn't put that under the youth

6918.56 --> 6922.8
category i'd put that on the opposite

6920.48 --> 6922.799999999999
actually

6926.239 --> 6930.04
don't worry about it

6932.159 --> 6936.799999999999
speedy speaking for five hours nonce

6935.36 --> 6939.759999999999
jesus

6936.8 --> 6942.159000000001
dude that's

6939.76 --> 6942.159000000001
god

6944.0 --> 6949.44
five hours

6946.56 --> 6949.4400000000005
whoa what are you doing

6951.52 --> 6953.92
dank

6954.08 --> 6958.08
what's

6955.199 --> 6958.08
going on

6959.679 --> 6964.96
did you just pocket ban crack villain by

6962.48 --> 6964.959999999999
accident

6973.199 --> 6978.32
whoa what's going on

6976.0 --> 6978.32
right

6979.679 --> 6984.4800000000005
yeah let's see dank

6982.48 --> 6986.0
but i think he's probably done that by

6984.48 --> 6988.4
accident

6986.0 --> 6990.88
either fat finger syndrome or a pocket

6988.4 --> 6990.879999999999
banning

6999.44 --> 7004.4
it was a joke oh so you're not five

7002.08 --> 7006.8
hours non-stop live streaming

7004.4 --> 7006.799999999999
all right

7007.28 --> 7010.8
should spanner up crack film

7013.199 --> 7018.638999999999
maybe

7015.119 --> 7018.639
i don't know him that long yet

7021.28 --> 7025.44
i don't just

7023.119 --> 7029.679
auto hand every

7025.44 --> 7032.239
g plus fed panelist a wrench

7029.679 --> 7032.2390000000005
jamaican

7036.08 --> 7038.639
but hey

7041.04 --> 7046.96
so was it fat finger syndrome or was it

7043.36 --> 7046.96
a pocket man dank which one

7051.3 --> 7054.52
[Music]

7056.96 --> 7061.199
drop the phone behind the couch

7063.04 --> 7067.679
okay i guess

7065.28 --> 7070.08
that could be counted as a pocket man

7067.679 --> 7071.52
since it's not your fingers it's the

7070.08 --> 7073.84
environment

7071.52 --> 7073.84
yeah

7086.32 --> 7090.4
right yeah but crack phil don't worry

7088.0 --> 7092.48
about it i will probably rent you up

7090.4 --> 7095.04
somewhere in the next time i just per

7092.48 --> 7098.0
default don't hand them out right away i

7095.04 --> 7099.28
like even if i'm like oh i love this guy

7098.0 --> 7102.239
i don't

7099.28 --> 7104.5599999999995
just do that

7102.239 --> 7107.919999999999
i have to get over the in in

7104.56 --> 7109.52
initial enthusiasm phase

7107.92 --> 7111.679
first

7109.52 --> 7115.320000000001
therefore i can properly size up what

7111.679 --> 7115.32
i'm looking at

7116.639 --> 7121.36
what on

7117.92 --> 7122.4800000000005
flat earth 2.0

7121.36 --> 7124.799999999999
oh really

7122.48 --> 7124.799999999999
okay

7126.4 --> 7132.36
cool

7129.04 --> 7132.36
good to know

7142.0 --> 7146.8
that's right adam makin

7144.8 --> 7150.599
a couch man

7146.8 --> 7150.599
testy rider this

7174.239 --> 7177.638999999999
all right

7185.36 --> 7188.799999999999
man time has flown

7190.4 --> 7193.44
but

7191.36 --> 7196.92
yeah i think that's it's been a it's

7193.44 --> 7196.919999999999
been a good show

7201.28 --> 7204.719
definitely good for me

7207.84 --> 7212.04
it's good to be hungry again

7221.36 --> 7226.5199999999995
if crack villain got taken down by a

7223.52 --> 7226.52
cushion

7239.199 --> 7244.719
yeah now an image comes to mind adam

7242.4 --> 7247.119
relating to the

7244.719 --> 7249.52
video footage from eric to base video

7247.119 --> 7252.239
about ghost now i'm just seeing like

7249.52 --> 7254.88
crack film kind of superficially how i

7252.239 --> 7256.879999999999
imagine he would look like

7254.88 --> 7260.0
and then some cushion just

7256.88 --> 7263.8
come flying towards him and just

7260.0 --> 7263.8
bang him in the face

7270.0 --> 7273.719
it's a ghost cushion

7291.92 --> 7296.84
or a dust bunny

7293.84 --> 7296.84
what

7297.44 --> 7301.239
what's a dust bunny

7315.28 --> 7319.04
found any treasure in his couch

7321.84 --> 7326.8
well over time

7325.199 --> 7329.44
there's probably going to be less

7326.8 --> 7331.92
treasure found in couches

7329.44 --> 7334.48
you know because you can't accidentally

7331.92 --> 7336.08
lose crypto in your couch if you know

7334.48 --> 7338.959999999999
what i mean

7336.08 --> 7341.199
i mean you might lose track of a usb

7338.96 --> 7344.719
stick that has crypto on it and then

7341.199 --> 7344.719
lose that in the couch

7345.04 --> 7350.56
but i don't think people just

7347.76 --> 7353.280000000001
on a daily basis walk around with

7350.56 --> 7357.88
crypto field usb sticks although maybe

7353.28 --> 7357.88
in the near future they will who knows

7370.159 --> 7374.879999999999
you know what i what you look do i know

7372.48 --> 7378.119
what you look oh

7374.88 --> 7378.119
do i

7382.32 --> 7385.119
wait

7383.199 --> 7387.36
you're the guy into swords and all that

7385.119 --> 7387.36

7393.119 --> 7395.839999999999

7430.96 --> 7433.44
dude

7431.92 --> 7436.4800000000005

7451.119 --> 7454.719
coming through all of a sudden i guess

7453.76 --> 7457.4400000000005
it's

7454.719 --> 7457.44
as i said

7458.4 --> 7462.879999999999
when you first did it did you conspire

7460.88 --> 7463.76
to do this

7462.88 --> 7466.8
just

7463.76 --> 7468.56
hold out on me for like a week or two

7466.8 --> 7471.92
and then suddenly

7468.56 --> 7474.88
pile it all on and then get it right

7471.92 --> 7478.32
are we not emotional again zeu you just

7474.88 --> 7480.400000000001

7485.76 --> 7491.320000000001
this is quite a sizable donation thank

7487.92 --> 7491.32
you very much

7495.199 --> 7497.44
oh

7497.599 --> 7500.96
wow

7498.4 --> 7504.36
things can change around so dramatically

7500.96 --> 7504.36
all of a sudden

7514.4 --> 7518.96
extremely dapper

7516.96 --> 7522.32
what

7518.96 --> 7526.32
i don't know that in english terminology

7522.32 --> 7529.119
i mean in dutch dapper means brave

7526.32 --> 7531.119
does it mean the same in english

7529.119 --> 7534.119
never heard english people use that

7531.119 --> 7534.119
before

7535.679 --> 7539.4800000000005
hey oh brambo

7555.44 --> 7562.199
it means he's smart dressed oh

7558.4 --> 7562.199
okay okay

7566.56 --> 7570.92
so that's definitely different then

7598.639 --> 7603.96
meet and trim in dress

7600.8 --> 7603.96
and appearance

7607.76 --> 7612.639
interesting adam i literally have never

7610.32 --> 7615.599
ever heard somebody

7612.639 --> 7617.599
say that in english before

7615.599 --> 7620.400000000001
like and that includes

7617.599 --> 7623.96
my english teachers

7620.4 --> 7623.96
so that's interesting

7635.599 --> 7640.1990000000005
all right do you pronounce it a dapper

7649.92 --> 7653.04
all right cool

7653.36 --> 7660.5199999999995
another english word learned

7656.32 --> 7660.5199999999995
i wonder if it'll stick

7664.19 --> 7667.32
[Music]

7671.84 --> 7675.679
oh

7673.44 --> 7678.239
really your family

7675.679 --> 7678.2390000000005
brambo

7678.48 --> 7683.839999999999
cracks family all right wow he's getting

7681.119 --> 7685.839999999999
the whole family into it

7683.84 --> 7689.719
cool

7685.84 --> 7689.719
yeah welcome to the show

7696.719 --> 7700.079
hmm

7698.4 --> 7706.0
okay peachy cruise shank so it's

7700.079 --> 7706.0
regional interesting that go figures

7706.56 --> 7709.92
because

7707.599 --> 7712.4800000000005
yeah freaking english man

7709.92 --> 7714.88
it's like on one side of the island they

7712.48 --> 7717.759999999999
talk they use different words that are

7714.88 --> 7719.36
like no no for the other side i don't

7717.76 --> 7721.52
get that

7719.36 --> 7722.88
but that's like very english like in the

7721.52 --> 7724.159000000001
netherlands yeah there's different

7722.88 --> 7725.92
dialects

7724.159 --> 7728.239
but there's not like

7725.92 --> 7731.679
you don't talk like that on this side of

7728.239 --> 7733.839999999999
the netherlands there's not none of that

7731.679 --> 7736.32
so it's really telling that that's so

7733.84 --> 7736.32
english

7738.0 --> 7741.679
say dapper in australia oh

7743.52 --> 7745.84
all right

7746.48 --> 7753.759999999999
go figures

7748.96 --> 7756.719
wait it's go figure right not go figures

7753.76 --> 7759.84
like it figures or go figure gotta get

7756.719 --> 7759.84
it right

7794.079 --> 7800.759999999999
dapper is the best way to say fly what

7797.76 --> 7800.76
oh

7801.84 --> 7805.92
yeah that's definitely an another

7804.32 --> 7808.96
region

7805.92 --> 7808.96
for the expression

7810.719 --> 7816.079
they're all into fe oh jesus

7813.679 --> 7816.079
alright

7817.28 --> 7820.32
cool

7818.48 --> 7823.32
i guess you got an entire family in

7820.32 --> 7823.32
there

7847.44 --> 7852.0
right pj khrushchev yeah go figure is

7850.079 --> 7852.88
american

7852.0 --> 7856.36
but

7852.88 --> 7856.36
that figures

7857.44 --> 7860.799999999999
is

7858.4 --> 7863.199
is that also american or is that more

7860.8 --> 7867.079000000001
like british way of saying it it's all

7863.199 --> 7867.079
these subtle differences

7892.159 --> 7895.159
uh

7900.079 --> 7903.119
oh sorry

7903.84 --> 7908.639
that figures would be more british

7907.76 --> 7910.639
yeah

7908.639 --> 7913.36
yeah that's that's the impression that

7910.639 --> 7915.36
i'm getting it's so funny how that works

7913.36 --> 7917.36
because in my mind i'm basically like

7915.36 --> 7921.679
okay saying it

7917.36 --> 7921.679
then making that word reflect off

7922.48 --> 7928.799999999999
as many british people having heard them

7925.599 --> 7930.8
say things as i can in my like an echoey

7928.8 --> 7933.92
mind it's like okay all this it's like

7930.8 --> 7934.96
does that fit does that fit it

7933.92 --> 7938.0
and then

7934.96 --> 7940.4
go figure like no that's not

7938.0 --> 7942.159
that doesn't feel like it fits but

7940.4 --> 7944.719
there's a whole bunch of americans that

7942.159 --> 7947.44
i've caught having said that so then it

7944.719 --> 7950.88
fits there it's so funny

7947.44 --> 7953.36
how i how i try to place this like

7950.88 --> 7954.96
who says what why where do these sayings

7953.36 --> 7957.119
come from

7954.96 --> 7960.079
how is it different and it's so

7957.119 --> 7961.759999999999
intuitive it's like no that saying

7960.079 --> 7964.719
doesn't fit there

7961.76 --> 7968.719
but if it's over there

7964.719 --> 7970.2390000000005
and it's to me a very intuitive process

7968.719 --> 7973.599
but i think i'm

7970.239 --> 7973.598999999999
pretty decent at it

7973.679 --> 7978.88
i mean i'm not

7976.48 --> 7981.44
english born

7978.88 --> 7983.119
but for a non-english board i think i'm

7981.44 --> 7986.079
pretty good at it

7983.119 --> 7986.079
i'm kind of proud of it

7991.119 --> 7994.88
instead of saying cool everyone would

7992.88 --> 7997.84
say grouse

7994.88 --> 7997.84
cringy gs

8006.639 --> 8008.639
dude

8007.52 --> 8011.84
yeah

8008.639 --> 8014.639
but like

8011.84 --> 8014.639
the word cool

8014.96 --> 8017.679
or chill

8019.76 --> 8023.280000000001
you know that can go go all over the

8022.079 --> 8027.36
place

8023.28 --> 8030.5599999999995
like what the youth uses for that as a

8027.36 --> 8033.92
slang is in constant roulette

8030.56 --> 8036.320000000001
like it changes constantly

8033.92 --> 8038.8
it's like also supposed to change for

8036.32 --> 8041.28
some reason it's like part of the gig i

8038.8 --> 8043.679
remember when i was much younger

8041.28 --> 8045.679
that always being ahead of what people

8043.679 --> 8047.36
were used to

8045.679 --> 8050.56
with for that expression was kind of

8047.36 --> 8052.96
like the reason you're doing it

8050.56 --> 8055.92
it's kind of to make the older people

8052.96 --> 8058.32
feel old it's like ha ha

8055.92 --> 8060.159
not quick enough for the youth and

8058.32 --> 8061.92
that's why the words always just

8060.159 --> 8065.839999999999
changing about

8061.92 --> 8069.04
like what do you use to say cool

8065.84 --> 8071.84
used to be groovy this is

8069.04 --> 8071.84
for the boomers

8074.96 --> 8078.96
based

8076.0 --> 8080.48
yeah but based is different

8078.96 --> 8083.679
based

8080.48 --> 8086.4
is a popular expression now

8083.679 --> 8089.36
but it is much more detailed as to what

8086.4 --> 8092.879999999999
it actually means

8089.36 --> 8095.839999999999
based has requirements cool is just

8092.88 --> 8095.84
could be anything

8097.44 --> 8103.759999999999
you don't yeah

8099.199 --> 8103.759999999999
somebody is not just automatically based

8103.84 --> 8108.84
should be no no that would be bad

8109.36 --> 8115.679
because based has requirements

8112.8 --> 8118.320000000001
it's not meant to just throw around and

8115.679 --> 8121.32
call anybody based when they are not

8118.32 --> 8121.32
based

8122.88 --> 8127.52
right it requires you to have a

8125.76 --> 8129.84
base

8127.52 --> 8132.56
a strong foundation

8129.84 --> 8132.56
cohesion

8134.079 --> 8139.36
and often rigidity

8136.4 --> 8142.239
added that's what based

8139.36 --> 8142.239
emphasizes

8142.4 --> 8146.5599999999995
it should not be just casually thrown at

8145.599 --> 8148.88
things

8146.56 --> 8151.84
because you are slightly superficially

8148.88 --> 8151.84
impressed

8153.84 --> 8158.400000000001
that's my opinion

8155.52 --> 8160.88
it has more value and it should be

8158.4 --> 8162.0
that value should be retained should be

8160.88 --> 8165.84
guarded

8162.0 --> 8165.84
you don't just call anybody based

8167.199 --> 8171.759999999999
like

8169.44 --> 8171.759999999999
right

8172.56 --> 8176.56
even like if somebody would call me

8174.719 --> 8179.84
based

8176.56 --> 8179.84
i would be

8180.8 --> 8184.4800000000005
uh yeah

8182.719 --> 8187.36
i would be in confliction about that

8184.48 --> 8190.079
because in one side i would be like yeah

8187.36 --> 8192.479
i know that part's based

8190.079 --> 8194.96
making great effort but then there's the

8192.479 --> 8196.8
other side and so yeah i'm not really

8194.96 --> 8200.16
that based

8196.8 --> 8203.679
right but i appreciate the compliment

8200.16 --> 8204.84
but yeah let's keep it realistic here

8203.679 --> 8209.04
you

8204.84 --> 8212.319
know i i can't just declare myself based

8209.04 --> 8213.2
because i'm really good at one thing

8212.319 --> 8215.84
because

8213.2 --> 8217.76
i am not financially self-sufficient

8215.84 --> 8221.04
although it it's kind of working with

8217.76 --> 8224.08
you guys today

8221.04 --> 8224.080000000002
i don't have kids

8225.04 --> 8227.76
i don't have a

8227.92 --> 8231.2
like a farm

8229.359 --> 8236.16
and i had set

8231.2 --> 8236.16
high standards for what based really is

8240.719 --> 8246.24
right but the most important part about

8242.88 --> 8249.438999999998
it is that you are self-sufficient

8246.24 --> 8252.639
and productive and developing those are

8249.439 --> 8254.08
the key components

8252.639 --> 8256.719
for it to

8254.08 --> 8258.479
actually become based for somebody to

8256.719 --> 8259.438999999998
become based you have to have those

8258.479 --> 8261.039999999999
things

8259.439 --> 8262.479000000001
you have to follow logos you have to

8261.04 --> 8264.240000000002
follow that path you have to work

8262.479 --> 8267.039999999999
towards it

8264.24 --> 8269.84
if you don't you're not based

8267.04 --> 8269.84
it's that simple

8272.08 --> 8275.84
that's right

8274.24 --> 8278.399
thus

8275.84 --> 8281.399
its application it's harder to apply

8278.399 --> 8281.399
yeah

8297.2 --> 8301.76
yeah

8298.0 --> 8305.84
that's a good description george sanford

8301.76 --> 8305.84
arwen is a based flat earther

8307.04 --> 8311.28
yeah

8308.479 --> 8315.559
i accept that

8311.28 --> 8315.559000000001
i definitely accept that

8324.96 --> 8331.678999999998
i mean i think that i i would dare call

8327.92 --> 8334.319
myself intellectually based

8331.679 --> 8334.319
that part

8335.84 --> 8340.16
and a lot of that spans flat earth

8339.12 --> 8341.92
knowledge

8340.16 --> 8345.28
and insights

8341.92 --> 8347.12
and being too soon

8345.28 --> 8350.0
staying ahead of the

8347.12 --> 8351.2
development curve

8350.0 --> 8353.92
and

8351.2 --> 8354.719000000001
basically watching as the world catches

8353.92 --> 8357.04
on

8354.719 --> 8358.839999999998
and assimilates

8357.04 --> 8363.439
things that have been saying five years

8358.84 --> 8366.479
ago slowly and resisting it again right

8363.439 --> 8368.24
hesitance it's like no we don't want

8366.479 --> 8371.119999999999
that to be real

8368.24 --> 8372.88
so we're gonna try to disprove it

8371.12 --> 8375.519
and the more they try the more it just

8372.88 --> 8378.479
turns out like yeah there's no use

8375.519 --> 8380.319
i literally saw it five years ago like

8378.479 --> 8382.639
this is it

8380.319 --> 8384.719
this is it

8382.639 --> 8386.0
everybody's gonna object but this is

8384.719 --> 8388.88
what it is

8386.0 --> 8392.16
i just saw it i knew it and i'm like

8388.88 --> 8392.16
okay i'm gonna spend

8392.24 --> 8400.359
maybe the rest of my life

8395.2 --> 8400.359
trying to get people to realize it

8402.16 --> 8408.24
and learn more on the way because

8405.439 --> 8410.64
i didn't see absolutely everything

8408.24 --> 8412.96
but i saw those things i saw like hey

8410.64 --> 8415.279999999999
the sun is holographic

8412.96 --> 8415.279999999999
boom

8415.52 --> 8420.800000000001
uh space

8418.24 --> 8423.039999999999
of the realm may not be entirely linear

8420.8 --> 8423.039999999999
boom

8424.08 --> 8429.12
the maps are not the scale all of them

8426.64 --> 8431.358999999999
including the flat earth map supposedly

8429.12 --> 8434.0
boom right

8431.359 --> 8437.319
all those things

8434.0 --> 8437.319
too soon

8453.2 --> 8456.2
hmm

8460.319 --> 8464.8
i still remember like i had it in an

8462.319 --> 8467.279999999999
icon space

8464.8 --> 8469.92
is not linear i actually put that in an

8467.28 --> 8474.08
icon on my original icon so it's like

8469.92 --> 8476.960000000001
it's out there visually

8474.08 --> 8476.96
five years ago

8480.16 --> 8482.96
and

8481.04 --> 8485.68
i'm happy to say that

8482.96 --> 8486.96
on average now there is people

8485.68 --> 8490.479000000001
that are

8486.96 --> 8494.08
finding the confidence and the balls

8490.479 --> 8497.84
the grip to actually start considering

8494.08 --> 8499.68
spatial non-linearity very carefully

8497.84 --> 8503.2
but they're actually

8499.68 --> 8505.2
slowly starting to allow themselves to

8503.2 --> 8507.04
consider something like that that there

8505.2 --> 8508.479000000001
is something going on

8507.04 --> 8512.240000000002
like that

8508.479 --> 8514.56
that space may not be entirely linear

8512.24 --> 8516.64
and i'm very happy about that and i

8514.56 --> 8519.039999999999
expected it to take a long time actually

8516.64 --> 8522.8
when i started out with the responses i

8519.04 --> 8526.319000000001
got back then and i mean from everyone

8522.8 --> 8528.319
the higher up flat earthers everyone

8526.319 --> 8530.64
i thought

8528.319 --> 8532.72
oh my god this is people are never gonna

8530.64 --> 8534.96
learn this

8532.72 --> 8536.72
i thought back then like i can repeat

8534.96 --> 8538.96
this for 20 years and they're never

8536.72 --> 8541.679999999998
gonna listen

8538.96 --> 8543.759999999998
so i'm pleasantly surprised that roughly

8541.68 --> 8547.52
five or six years later it turns out

8543.76 --> 8550.72
that people are slowly starting to

8547.52 --> 8552.640000000001
allow themselves to consider it if just

8550.72 --> 8554.479
in a thought experiment and i'm happy

8552.64 --> 8557.599999999999
about that

8554.479 --> 8559.119999999999
it's a good thing means there is still

8557.6 --> 8562.92
growth room

8559.12 --> 8562.92
development room

8577.359 --> 8582.2
right anyway i think i'm gonna round out

8579.04 --> 8582.2
the show

8593.84 --> 8596.84
do

8600.72 --> 8604.399
right

8601.92 --> 8606.56
so thanks everyone for coming

i hope you like this show

8606.56 --> 8609.68

8610.16 --> 8615.439
yeah intense for me personally

8613.12 --> 8615.439
hold on

8619.68 --> 8624.92
but i think it turned

8621.6 --> 8624.92
quite good

8626.479 --> 8631.84
so thanks everyone for coming
