I'm good for the weekend at least so

98.579 --> 100.88
right

102.06 --> 108.479
the weather today is kind of dreary and

106.439 --> 111.119
rainy

108.479 --> 115.32
continually

111.119 --> 116.7
and even like kind of like slushy snowy

115.32 --> 119.1
rain a bit

116.7 --> 121.619
but also regular rain it's not snowing

119.1 --> 123.96
like it was yesterday

121.619 --> 126.42
and the day before

123.96 --> 128.51999999999998
but it's pretty cold outside and very

126.42 --> 131.66
happy that I don't have to go out for

128.52 --> 136.04000000000002
groceries and all today

131.66 --> 136.04
very happy about that indeed

137.28 --> 140.3
all right so

140.4 --> 143.72
not very interesting

153.319 --> 157.45899999999997
it's cold anyway

157.68 --> 163.519
hello turret 306 first in chat good to

161.22 --> 163.519
see you

164.16 --> 169.92
it is Friday the 10th of March 2023

171.599 --> 177.599
I got a bit of a subject but I mean

175.08 --> 179.4
I brought this up before I just thought

177.599 --> 181.85999999999999
it was worth bringing it up again

179.4 --> 185.70000000000002
because I watched

181.86 --> 188.22000000000003
all right finished watching what is it

185.7 --> 191.57999999999998
should be

188.22 --> 194.159
on a Monday or Tuesday stream oh

191.58 --> 196.92000000000002
Benjamin

194.159 --> 198.019
talk the whale episode

196.92 --> 201.0
because

198.019 --> 204.72
Owen also has basically brought forth

201.0 --> 205.8
what I was saying way when the whole gym

204.72 --> 208.85999999999999
Bob

205.8 --> 210.92000000000002
versus Owen debacle enrolled

208.86 --> 214.20000000000002
that hey

210.92 --> 216.659
hermeneutics that's Hermes like I

214.2 --> 219.72
treated this on my show

216.659 --> 222.72
then that's like

219.72 --> 225.959
more than a week ago

222.72 --> 228.54
and Owen is finally wow that I don't

225.959 --> 231.739
want to sound patronizing but I mean he

228.54 --> 231.739
has caught on to this

232.2 --> 237.659
I mean he's a busy man so but it's just

235.739 --> 240.84
kind of funny because I call it out very

237.659 --> 242.28
quickly and now he has caught on and

240.84 --> 245.239
that's cool

242.28 --> 245.239
because it's true

246.92 --> 252.78
hermeneutical

248.72 --> 255.48
hermeneutics or hermeneuetics as they

252.78 --> 257.519
preferred it'd be said

255.48 --> 260.519
I like hermeneutics

257.519 --> 263.759
but hermeneutics is derived from the

260.519 --> 265.38
word Hermes and by the way it wasn't

263.759 --> 269.1
Hermes

265.38 --> 273.56
trimages it's actually Hermes

269.1 --> 273.56
from the from the Greek pantheon

273.72 --> 278.58000000000004
which is what I thought although yeah I

275.94 --> 283.44
mean the two are very close I mean

278.58 --> 287.69899999999996
Hermes traumagistes is probably somebody

283.44 --> 292.199
a person or a myth probably a person

287.699 --> 296.40000000000003
that was into Hermes

292.199 --> 299.52000000000004
so he basically made him like yeah it's

296.4 --> 302.28
very very safe in a way but

299.52 --> 305.75899999999996
he made himself into

302.28 --> 307.32
like a personification of Hermes in a

305.759 --> 309.06
way

307.32 --> 310.8
so you could say he was channeling

309.06 --> 313.699
Hermes with all kinds of bizarre

310.8 --> 313.699
implications anyway

313.8 --> 320.12
they're linked is what I'm saying but

316.86 --> 320.12
anyway a Oz

320.28 --> 323.05999999999995
how are you doing

324.84 --> 328.28
Dr Becky video

328.46 --> 332.539
jwst well what is that

334.86 --> 340.1
I don't know what j w s t is

350.1 --> 357.96000000000004
you wanted to ask imp question you mean

354.0 --> 361.259
important question sure go ahead

357.96 --> 363.29999999999995
Space Telescope oh

361.259 --> 365.759
goody

363.3 --> 367.919
no I don't watch Dr Becky's videos

365.759 --> 372.139
because she literally scrambles your

367.919 --> 372.139
mind like a like an omelette

372.539 --> 378.65999999999997
she's so relentlessly deep diving in

375.84 --> 379.979
presuppositions without looking back

378.66 --> 382.139
that

379.979 --> 383.419
it's very unpleasant to actually just

382.139 --> 387.3
watch that

383.419 --> 390.419
like really makes you sick it's good to

387.3 --> 391.5
like have it to see Nathan review such

390.419 --> 393.96
things

391.5 --> 396.24
on the slow pace because then it's more

393.96 --> 400.02
palatable because if you just watch it

396.24 --> 402.84000000000003
continually it pure poison scrambles

400.02 --> 405.68
your head like an omelette

402.84 --> 405.67999999999995
terrible

405.72 --> 409.62
or into her vids

408.36 --> 411.66
no

409.62 --> 414.18
well I mentioned her a couple of times

411.66 --> 415.97900000000004
because I don't know I she looks kind of

414.18 --> 419.639
cute

415.979 --> 421.68
I guess but I mean what she talks about

419.639 --> 425.6
is pure poison

421.68 --> 425.6
it's become worse also

426.72 --> 434.3
she was slightly more subtle a few years

429.78 --> 437.52
ago now it's it's just so relentlessly

434.3 --> 440.28000000000003
presuppositional it's insane

437.52 --> 442.38
I mean you're literally you literally

440.28 --> 445.02
lose track of what she's actually

442.38 --> 447.599
talking about because she she just goes

445.02 --> 450.35999999999996
step after step after step and

447.599 --> 452.21999999999997
it's it's actually kind of borderline

450.36 --> 454.259
psychotic

452.22 --> 457.259
if I have to be

454.259 --> 459.539
plain about it

457.259 --> 463.56
what comes out of back it really is but

459.539 --> 465.71999999999997
I mean yeah there's more

463.56 --> 468.419
of those types of people that talk about

465.72 --> 472.38000000000005
these things that that go on the edge of

468.419 --> 475.139
that and she definitely is because she's

472.38 --> 478.46
so relentlessly presuppositional with

475.139 --> 478.46000000000004
without looking back

480.18 --> 486.78000000000003
foreign

482.88 --> 488.52
if you know what I mean anyway ah

486.78 --> 492.96
[Music]

488.52 --> 495.71999999999997
I don't mind you mentioning about her

492.96 --> 499.46
but I'm just not watching those videos I

495.72 --> 499.46000000000004
don't watch any of those types of videos

501.599 --> 506.4
I mean why would I

503.94 --> 508.379
they'll they'll just scramble my brain I

506.4 --> 511.08
can literally come up with these types

508.379 --> 512.88
of things myself and much better a much

511.08 --> 515.2189999999999
more explicable

512.88 --> 518.419
and I do that sometimes

515.219 --> 518.4190000000001
just on the spot

518.88 --> 523.979
I like to think that at least on a

521.459 --> 525.959
non-mathematical level I have pretty

523.979 --> 529.64
much mastered the

525.959 --> 529.64
the fictional Globe model

529.8 --> 536.459
that of course is not actually a model

532.44 --> 539.0400000000001
according to QE but

536.459 --> 540.8389999999999
that Heritage of thinking the mechanics

539.04 --> 543.54
behind it yeah

540.839 --> 544.9200000000001
I've been a big fan as as in science

543.54 --> 548.16
fiction and

544.92 --> 550.399
I'm good at that I was always good at

548.16 --> 550.399
that

551.16 --> 556.38
and I would always basically be poking

554.519 --> 558.3
at other people that were fantasizing

556.38 --> 561.36
about space things or whatever and then

558.3 --> 563.66
correcting them like I was kind of that

561.36 --> 563.66
guy

564.839 --> 571.86
but my input would be very refined

568.98 --> 574.279
because I was a big fan of all that

571.86 --> 574.279
anyway

578.1 --> 583.519
oh fap movement yeah good

580.8 --> 583.519
damn it

586.26 --> 591.06
what are my thoughts about it well

589.019 --> 592.98
I don't typically like to talk about

591.06 --> 595.92
those types of things

592.98 --> 598.58
if you know what I mean

595.92 --> 601.38
but uh yeah

598.58 --> 603.4200000000001
oh Benjamin has talked about that sort

601.38 --> 604.8
of thing a lot and it made a lot of

603.42 --> 608.12
sense to me

604.8 --> 608.12
and I have

608.3 --> 614.959
dramatically uh

611.399 --> 614.959
toned it down as well

615.12 --> 619.519
for some time and it is much better

630.54 --> 635.0999999999999
what does yeah you're gonna have to

632.459 --> 637.0799999999999
watch those streams Ben my friend I'm

635.1 --> 639.0
not gonna talk about it I don't want to

637.08 --> 641.9590000000001
talk about that sort of [ __ ] in detail

639.0 --> 641.959
if you know what I mean

654.839 --> 660.2
100 plus wow okay that's fanatical

662.16 --> 665.899
right well for me

666.899 --> 670.339
yeah that's a bit much

671.339 --> 676.7600000000001
but yeah I'm sorry I I don't want to

673.92 --> 676.76
really talk about it

678.3 --> 683.16
I mean

680.16 --> 685.68
I do long for women and sometimes I do

683.16 --> 689.18
have like dreams

685.68 --> 689.18
and yeah

691.26 --> 694.88
but I don't watch porn

697.079 --> 703.9799999999999
I used to and then

700.92 --> 706.86
well Owen basically reminded everybody

703.98 --> 708.9590000000001
about it like what the influence of that

706.86 --> 713.899
really is and

708.959 --> 713.899
and I worked on that and then I stopped

714.62 --> 719.18
now very very rarely

719.579 --> 724.76
can't even remember last time

722.16 --> 724.76
but uh

730.38 --> 734.1
you feel like a super yeah

732.6 --> 736.62
it does

734.1 --> 738.86
like help you retain a lot of strength

736.62 --> 738.86
energy

741.18 --> 746.399
but you have to be careful because if

743.579 --> 748.76
you're a hot hat it can also amplify

746.399 --> 748.76
that

754.32 --> 760.38
but then again

756.24 --> 764.1
if you squirt a lot as they say you also

760.38 --> 766.74
typically get more cranky so basically

764.1 --> 768.98
doesn't really matter anyhow in that

766.74 --> 768.98
sense

774.839 --> 781.0400000000001
it's easy to fall into being a porn

777.36 --> 781.04
addicted cookie cutter

781.279 --> 788.1
that's a really funny way of saying it

784.5 --> 790.38
right but I mean yeah porn is is

788.1 --> 793.4590000000001
dangerous

790.38 --> 793.459
it really is

793.56 --> 798.8
and for me it was a big problem very

796.32 --> 798.8000000000001
early on

799.139 --> 802.74
like

800.459 --> 805.92
first time I got even glimpses of that

802.74 --> 809.94
through like stupid television shows a

805.92 --> 813.3199999999999
late night that I secretly watched ugh

809.94 --> 813.32
before the internet

814.5 --> 820.38
and it it like really got to me I got

818.1 --> 823.44
obsessed with that [ __ ]

820.38 --> 825.8389999999999
I guess that a lot of kids do

823.44 --> 829.5600000000001
at first at least

825.839 --> 831.7790000000001
and yeah it was not very helpful it it

829.56 --> 836.18
it really did kind of like made me

831.779 --> 836.18
overly nervous in front of women

838.2 --> 843.5400000000001
and like the reality of actual like

841.68 --> 847.4399999999999
sexual activity at first was like really

843.54 --> 850.5
Out Of Reach because then and yeah

847.44 --> 854.2790000000001
that's why for me actually the first

850.5 --> 857.399
real time I had sex was 18.

854.279 --> 861.18
and I I was really like ah damn it

857.399 --> 864.5
because I wanted that since I was like

861.18 --> 864.5
12 to be fair

864.72 --> 870.2
anyway

867.14 --> 870.1999999999999
[Music]

870.68 --> 875.88
but yeah I mean I just couldn't really

873.3 --> 879.56
connect with women now after 18 that

875.88 --> 879.56
started to go a lot better

881.459 --> 887.0999999999999
it's just that

884.639 --> 889.6800000000001
I don't connect with all women it's not

887.1 --> 892.38
like oh I could pick any woman no no I

889.68 --> 894.8389999999999
have pretty specific tastes and it's not

892.38 --> 896.76
super straightforward because it's

894.839 --> 898.0790000000001
really about their spirit and their

896.76 --> 901.8
Spirit root

898.079 --> 905.0999999999999
so this sounds weird but

901.8 --> 908.399
for me it's really important to know

905.1 --> 910.399
like their parents

908.399 --> 914.279
to know what they're like

910.399 --> 916.98
it's very important for me to know

914.279 --> 921.18
and especially like if they have

916.98 --> 923.639
conflicts how do they deal with that

921.18 --> 926.3389999999999
right and I prefer to even learn about

923.639 --> 927.24
this when the in-love phase is still

926.339 --> 930.1800000000001
there

927.24 --> 933.12
so I can have something to

930.18 --> 937.76
basically anticipate on

933.12 --> 937.76
when that kind of starts to die down

942.48 --> 948.899
or like even before I start to engage in

946.139 --> 951.0600000000001
Romance it's I don't know call me really

948.899 --> 953.76
old-fashioned it's like with a girl I'd

951.06 --> 955.68
prefer to meet their parents first at

953.76 --> 959.779
least

955.68 --> 959.779
before I engage in Romance

960.779 --> 966.68
woman also of course of course if

963.48 --> 966.6800000000001
they're older that's different

968.279 --> 971.68
like it there

970.139 --> 974.74
in their 30s or something

971.68 --> 974.7399999999999
[Music]

976.62 --> 982.019
hello Skippy

979.68 --> 985.5
oh no oh

982.019 --> 988.44
oh God because I got so angry because of

985.5 --> 991.44

you guys are so ridiculous

1014.54 --> 1018.68
you really think that Skippy now

1016.699 --> 1021.019
triggers me because

1018.68 --> 1022.88
I found out yesterday that I was

1021.019 --> 1026.299

1022.88 --> 1027.74

1026.299 --> 1030.28

it is shitty weather

1075.44 --> 1079.1000000000001
and kind of cold what is the temperature

1077.539 --> 1082.28

1079.1 --> 1083.6
yeah but please don't make any squirt

1082.28 --> 1086.6789999999999
jokes

1083.6 --> 1086.6789999999999
it's gross

1086.78 --> 1093.58
not gonna kick anybody over it but I

1089.6 --> 1093.58
don't like it just so you know uh

1094.7 --> 1098.66
yeah yeah I thought so three degrees

1096.5 --> 1099.799
Celsius so it's water cold that's why I

1098.66 --> 1101.8600000000001
feel

1099.799 --> 1101.86
like

1102.559 --> 1107.84
not super nice okay Saturday it's gonna

1104.84 --> 1110.4189999999999
be a bit Sunny it says

1107.84 --> 1113.74
and then it seems like it's gonna be a

1110.419 --> 1113.74
rainy week goody

1116.72 --> 1119.559
oh well

1119.96 --> 1126.52
[Music]

1122.12 --> 1126.52
do Ballers believe in nofap movement

1127.76 --> 1131.66
some

1130.1 --> 1134.6
yeah

1131.66 --> 1136.22
but tear it there's Ballers of all kinds

1134.6 --> 1139.6599999999999
right

1136.22 --> 1139.66
just there's

1139.9 --> 1146.0590000000002
there's Christian ballers

1142.82 --> 1148.9399999999998
that are very nofap

1146.059 --> 1151.4189999999999
but they're still very baller

1148.94 --> 1151.419
right

1152.6 --> 1157.76
and then there's

1154.22 --> 1159.679
pretend or like troll Christian Pharisee

1157.76 --> 1162.86
Christians

1159.679 --> 1164.72
also also all sorts

1162.86 --> 1166.8799999999999
and they probably say they don't and

1164.72 --> 1170.08
they still do so yeah there's people

1166.88 --> 1170.0800000000002
that lie about it too

1171.26 --> 1175.58
but yeah you can't just because you're a

1173.9 --> 1179.1200000000001
baller doesn't mean that you're

1175.58 --> 1181.82
literally addicted to porn although

1179.12 --> 1185.6
that's the weird thing

1181.82 --> 1186.98
it does cut yeah you do get exposed to

1185.6 --> 1191.08
it more

1186.98 --> 1191.08
if you're into that sort of thing

1207.559 --> 1214.0
right but that's more about just atheism

1211.4 --> 1217.52
the atheism part

1214.0 --> 1220.1
and like no not those you just do

1217.52 --> 1222.02
whatever you want

1220.1 --> 1225.039
you'll figure it out you'll do whatever

1222.02 --> 1225.039
you want to figure it out

1225.679 --> 1229.2800000000002
and then a lot of people don't figure it

1227.78 --> 1233.2
out and then they get a really crazy

1229.28 --> 1233.2
idea to reinforce their sins

1234.86 --> 1239.1789999999999
because they have no standard

1237.26 --> 1241.6
because they don't think there is a

1239.179 --> 1241.6000000000001
standard

1255.799 --> 1259.36
ize talking about

1272.78 --> 1277.72
your arcade shipping out what

1285.559 --> 1288.22
oh

1288.38 --> 1294.5200000000002
oh 4K yeah

1291.14 --> 1294.5200000000002
that sounds pretty cool

1311.059 --> 1314.02
okay Sarah

1314.12 --> 1320.86
well look Muhammad Ali I think and was

1317.9 --> 1320.8600000000001
also Muslim

1320.9 --> 1325.88
and it's very much a part of that like

1324.08 --> 1329.0
they don't

1325.88 --> 1333.46
it definitely if you are a serious

1329.0 --> 1333.46
Muslim you definitely are no fapper

1335.0 --> 1342.1
does the debate with Brenda still stand

1337.34 --> 1342.1
no she canceled because she refused

1344.12 --> 1349.4599999999998
because I said I would I refused I

1347.6 --> 1352.36
refuse as a condition

1349.46 --> 1356.539
from the start I refuse to talk about

1352.36 --> 1359.059
subjects that will get agitation and

1356.539 --> 1361.1589999999999
competitiveness and all that [ __ ]

1359.059 --> 1363.08
and I refuse to talk about Flat Earth

1361.159 --> 1364.64
because there's nothing sensible she's

1363.08 --> 1367.22
going to be saying about that I didn't

1364.64 --> 1369.919
want to talk about that

1367.22 --> 1372.44
and she insisted she wanted to talk

1369.919 --> 1374.539
about that [ __ ] that she always does

1372.44 --> 1375.8600000000001
and then gonna be whining about Nathan

1374.539 --> 1379.34
and

1375.86 --> 1381.559
then trying to get me out of flatter go

1379.34 --> 1385.539
[ __ ] yourself if that's all you want to

1381.559 --> 1385.539
talk about rather then go [ __ ] yourself

1385.58 --> 1390.9189999999999
and get a [ __ ] life

1388.4 --> 1393.74
I actually wanted to talk about your

1390.919 --> 1395.7800000000002
life for a change and you didn't you

1393.74 --> 1398.419
just want to talk about [ __ ] whining

1395.78 --> 1399.6789999999999
about Flat Earth

1398.419 --> 1400.88
so

1399.679 --> 1403.76
no

1400.88 --> 1406.3400000000001
rana's not coming on

1403.76 --> 1407.539
although status Moretz will come on

1406.34 --> 1409.82
tomorrow

1407.539 --> 1413.9
he was gonna come on today originally

1409.82 --> 1418.539
but uh yeah some work situation

1413.9 --> 1418.539
so we're moving it to tomorrow

1421.94 --> 1428.48
competitive it wasn't a debate by the

1424.88 --> 1430.7
way so at face I don't I overlooked that

1428.48 --> 1432.08
the first time you said if we weren't

1430.7 --> 1436.059
debating

1432.08 --> 1436.059
I'm not gonna have a debate

1436.52 --> 1443.08
I'll have a conversation with people I'm

1438.799 --> 1443.08
not gonna have a debate okay

1445.58 --> 1448.6
hey LSG

1450.919 --> 1455.38
I don't know who that is

1456.14 --> 1460.2990000000002
you don't know who Brenda is really

1463.64 --> 1466.76
she's all over the Discord and

1465.62 --> 1472.4189999999999
everything

1466.76 --> 1472.419
I mean you know who Brenda is seriously

1482.96 --> 1487.3400000000001
oh Seth yeah no you probably don't know

1485.68 --> 1489.74
[Music]

1487.34 --> 1492.039
now he's a guy that's kind of on the

1489.74 --> 1492.039
fence

1493.22 --> 1497.84
whose fault who's just been following my

1495.38 --> 1500.24
channel mostly so

1497.84 --> 1502.76
he's not like a Discord guy he has a

1500.24 --> 1505.84
life actually

1502.76 --> 1505.84
an actual life

1507.38 --> 1510.38
foreign

1514.659 --> 1519.98
hey why not I mean if there's something

1517.94 --> 1522.4
happening with Brenda then I'll talk

1519.98 --> 1522.4
about it

1522.94 --> 1528.799
mathematically challenged Balter

1526.1 --> 1530.6589999999999
I don't is she mathematically challenged

1528.799 --> 1533.24
I don't know is she really bad at math

1530.659 --> 1536.1200000000001
dude it's really weird why would I

1533.24 --> 1538.24
mention

1536.12 --> 1541.3999999999999
like I consider myself

1538.24 --> 1543.26
mathematically challenged in a way like

1541.4 --> 1545.72
I understand the framework I understand

1543.26 --> 1547.94
how things build but I am not good at

1545.72 --> 1549.799
math itself really

1547.94 --> 1553.779
my

1549.799 --> 1553.779
application of mathematical

1553.88 --> 1558.5
thinking has not really progressed a lot

1557.12 --> 1562.6589999999999
since

1558.5 --> 1562.659
like I was 18 or something

1568.76 --> 1573.1
so it's weird that you'd bring that up

1574.1 --> 1579.1999999999998
yeah okay you don't care about it I get

1576.74 --> 1582.14
it but I stopped talking about it you're

1579.2 --> 1585.52
now just complaining about it come on

1582.14 --> 1585.5200000000002
get a grip dude

1589.32 --> 1592.49
[Music]

1592.6 --> 1598.039
yes I know and that's why I'm not

1596.179 --> 1602.779
letting her on because all she was gonna

1598.039 --> 1604.4
do was whine and say stupid [ __ ]

1602.779 --> 1606.62
and nag

1604.4 --> 1608.539
against flat earthers

1606.62 --> 1610.76
and that's why I don't let her on

1608.539 --> 1613.82
because I didn't want to do that I would

1610.76 --> 1616.76
I actually wanted to talk about her life

1613.82 --> 1620.12
and transgenderism and all that

1616.76 --> 1623.14
she she just didn't want to okay she's

1620.12 --> 1623.1399999999999
that terrible

1624.74 --> 1633.02
I mean in this day and age

1629.36 --> 1636.86
how crazy is it like most transgenders

1633.02 --> 1641.26
that are like online

1636.86 --> 1641.26
they'd probably love to talk about that

1641.72 --> 1645.4
but why and how and

1645.5 --> 1651.74
what it's like and then she just no no

1648.74 --> 1655.48
no she just wants to nag about Flat

1651.74 --> 1655.48
Earth seriously what the [ __ ]

1655.9 --> 1659.679
yeah she whatever

1663.14 --> 1665.679
yes

1672.22 --> 1680.179
you see it like this little as she

1676.76 --> 1681.29
not a big ass not a real she but

1680.179 --> 1682.88
whatever

1681.29 --> 1685.52
[Music]

1682.88 --> 1690.14
I don't care I don't care about that

1685.52 --> 1693.62
stop whining about it I'll call it her

1690.14 --> 1695.9
if I freaking please do okay you can't

1693.62 --> 1699.3799999999999
[ __ ] tell me

1695.9 --> 1704.299
how I can pronoun somebody else okay

1699.38 --> 1707.96
they can't and neither can you guys do

1704.299 --> 1711.32
you [ __ ] understand okay

1707.96 --> 1714.159
don't [ __ ] tell me what pronouns to

1711.32 --> 1714.1589999999999
use you get it

1723.039 --> 1729.32
I'm gonna call her a she and that's

1726.14 --> 1731.72
final and I'd give a [ __ ]

1729.32 --> 1734.32
don't [ __ ] tell me what pronouns to

1731.72 --> 1734.32
use you hear

1734.86 --> 1743.02
you sound like an sjw when you do that

1739.7 --> 1743.02
don't you realize that

1744.09 --> 1747.619
[Music]

1749.6 --> 1755.48
and I have no issues really I figured

1752.539 --> 1757.279
this out about myself this is personal

1755.48 --> 1760.52
preference yeah because I mean the world

1757.279 --> 1763.46
is all screwed up I'm gonna do it my way

1760.52 --> 1765.1399999999999
okay even if it makes no freaking sense

1763.46 --> 1768.08
to everybody else

1765.14 --> 1770.0590000000002
but I have an issue

1768.08 --> 1771.799
with

1770.059 --> 1774.5
like

1771.799 --> 1777.08
female to male transition because that's

1774.5 --> 1778.82
like on a physical level very confusing

1777.08 --> 1781.399
to me

1778.82 --> 1784.22
and I have trouble by calling them he I

1781.399 --> 1787.279
really have I've noticed and I've dealt

1784.22 --> 1789.6200000000001
with one of them and like the weirdly

1787.279 --> 1792.14
enough like the female side of her I I

1789.62 --> 1794.36
actually liked I was actually kind of

1792.14 --> 1796.039
attracted to her and I kept calling it a

1794.36 --> 1798.1999999999998
her right so I have real trouble calling

1796.039 --> 1800.36
her her him

1798.2 --> 1802.3990000000001
because I'm actually kind of attracted

1800.36 --> 1805.34
to her

1802.399 --> 1808.039
as a female not interested in her

1805.34 --> 1810.4599999999998
transitioning as a man at all really to

1808.039 --> 1810.46
be fair

1810.86 --> 1815.899
I'm not

1812.74 --> 1819.44
but I'm just attracted to her as a

1815.899 --> 1822.7399999999998
person so then I have trouble calling

1819.44 --> 1824.8990000000001
like it him

1822.74 --> 1827.96
but the with men

1824.899 --> 1830.1789999999999
that want to be like a female they want

1827.96 --> 1831.679
to just be a she and they're like wigs

1830.179 --> 1833.8990000000001
or whatever and they're like really

1831.679 --> 1838.299
trying to look ladylike

1833.899 --> 1838.299
I have I will call them a she

1841.22 --> 1846.14
it's like that's no issue to me

1843.919 --> 1848.8400000000001
but it's not like I'm gonna find them

1846.14 --> 1851.96
attractive or anything

1848.84 --> 1854.1399999999999
I just have no problem calling them a

1851.96 --> 1854.14
she

1855.26 --> 1862.1589999999999
but with women that want to be men then

1859.94 --> 1864.799
it's Pro like that's more Troublesome

1862.159 --> 1867.8600000000001
it's like not because also political

1864.799 --> 1869.899
statement No it's I have trouble with

1867.86 --> 1872.899
that

1869.899 --> 1875.6589999999999
because there's like physical impulses

1872.899 --> 1877.9399999999998
that is like ah telling me like no it's

1875.659 --> 1880.94
a hurt it's hurt and that's confusing I

1877.94 --> 1883.76
with men I don't give a [ __ ] I'll call

1880.94 --> 1885.5
them a she it's like no I just go to

1883.76 --> 1887.96
that more

1885.5 --> 1890.6
the less yeah more into the dream world

1887.96 --> 1893.1200000000001
a bit on the intellectual side and just

1890.6 --> 1894.02
like no it's just things of her is no

1893.12 --> 1897.1999999999998
problem

1894.02 --> 1900.32
it just it works it is no problem to me

1897.2 --> 1903.919
and do not find them attractive

1900.32 --> 1908.1789999999999
like physically or anything

1903.919 --> 1912.3400000000001
I have just that's just how it is right

1908.179 --> 1914.96
and I don't care to like oh I'm going to

1912.34 --> 1917.9599999999998
Anchor you in the real world and tell

1914.96 --> 1920.8990000000001
you oh hey did you know that you're

1917.96 --> 1924.08
pretending to be the opposite sex it's

1920.899 --> 1927.08
not real like what the [ __ ] like like

1924.08 --> 1929.12
they don't realize that

1927.08 --> 1931.46
when you're already going there you

1929.12 --> 1934.6999999999998
think they don't know that

1931.46 --> 1936.32
it's [ __ ]

1934.7 --> 1939.94
to do that

1936.32 --> 1939.9399999999998
to people yeah

1941.36 --> 1946.9399999999998
now that doesn't mean that if you're

1943.64 --> 1950.0
going to like try to intervene when they

1946.94 --> 1951.799
talk their crazy gender [ __ ] to

1950.0 --> 1954.2
children

1951.799 --> 1957.26
I'm definitely all for intervention

1954.2 --> 1959.8400000000001
against that okay

1957.26 --> 1962.48
there that's where I absolutely draw

1959.84 --> 1964.399
that line it's like no you want to think

1962.48 --> 1965.779
though that's that's possible you want

1964.399 --> 1967.4599999999998
to live in that dream world and even

1965.779 --> 1969.679
mutilate yourself

1967.46 --> 1971.179
it's really your business but yeah I

1969.679 --> 1974.0
consider very carefully before

1971.179 --> 1975.44
proceeding seriously I mean keep it in

1974.0 --> 1978.2
your mind it's cute

1975.44 --> 1981.039
start once you start to make it actual

1978.2 --> 1984.32
you're gonna run into some very

1981.039 --> 1988.039
problematic situations inevitably

1984.32 --> 1992.059
right but don't you [ __ ] dare

1988.039 --> 1994.8799999999999
rub those crazy ideas off on children

1992.059 --> 1997.94
that's where I draw that line

1994.88 --> 2000.1000000000001
as long as these people keep it

1997.94 --> 2004.44
among themselves

2000.1 --> 2004.4399999999998
as adults it's like no it's

2004.899 --> 2009.9399999999998
fine

2007.0 --> 2012.94
I mean some people go all crazy mnemonic

2009.94 --> 2015.3990000000001
and like play shooting games all day

2012.94 --> 2018.8200000000002
and do drugs and whatever and act like

2015.399 --> 2020.1999999999998
[ __ ] that's there that's what what

2018.82 --> 2022.12
you're going to change what they are

2020.2 --> 2024.1000000000001
doing really no

2022.12 --> 2026.6399999999999
so why would you then change somebody

2024.1 --> 2029.1999999999998
that's just like kind of weird and

2026.64 --> 2030.76
Fantastical in their mind and and they

2029.2 --> 2033.039
think they're the opposite sex and they

2030.76 --> 2037.179
dress like that like

2033.039 --> 2039.22
what you can change that why because you

2037.179 --> 2040.0
can bully them easier because they're

2039.22 --> 2042.76
less

2040.0 --> 2046.12
like physically threatening or less

2042.76 --> 2047.919
aggressive or like I don't get it leave

2046.12 --> 2049.359
him alone

2047.919 --> 2052.359
but

2049.359 --> 2054.639
if you know they're actually rubbing

2052.359 --> 2058.0
their crazy ideas off on children that's

2054.639 --> 2062.339
an entirely different matter

2058.0 --> 2062.339
that would be classified as grooming

2064.839 --> 2067.56
you see

2070.54 --> 2073.5
anyway

2076.72 --> 2082.2599999999998
it's not a virtue signal for Casey it's

2079.48 --> 2082.26
not about that

2083.08 --> 2087.58
like I don't give a [ __ ] about virtue

2085.48 --> 2090.7
signal I'm I'm talking about smooth

2087.58 --> 2092.98
communication yeah I like to

2090.7 --> 2095.56
I like to actually make contact with

2092.98 --> 2098.28
people when I communicate with them

2095.56 --> 2098.2799999999997
you know

2101.5 --> 2105.24
hey Richard G it's you

2105.28 --> 2107.6400000000003
everybody

2111.04 --> 2117.22
so I can't wait communism was communism

2113.92 --> 2120.4
but yeah communism will always fail

2117.22 --> 2122.74
absolutely it's all artificial

2120.4 --> 2125.619
communism like the fanatical version of

2122.74 --> 2129.5789999999997
it is kind of like another imagination

2125.619 --> 2133.02
that you're bound to so

2129.579 --> 2133.02
in a way it is also crazy

2148.48 --> 2152.44
I'm really proud of my title by the way

2150.82 --> 2155.579
it's not something that I'm talking

2152.44 --> 2155.579
about right now but

2162.579 --> 2168.88
Lefty radical okay at phrase yes

2166.72 --> 2173.64
I know

2168.88 --> 2173.6400000000003
I was watching Alex Jones in 2008

2173.74 --> 2180.4199999999996
I'm well aware of what's going on

2177.88 --> 2180.42
cool

2180.52 --> 2183.52
beautiful

2189.76 --> 2196.7400000000002
yeah hey dank

2192.04 --> 2196.74
it's you man and thanks for the PayPal

2215.859 --> 2221.2799999999997
right

2218.26 --> 2224.2000000000003
but yeah so

2221.28 --> 2228.6600000000003
now we're talking about the car before

2224.2 --> 2228.66
the Brenda spiraling nonsense started

2232.18 --> 2234.8999999999996
huh

2239.92 --> 2242.7000000000003
oh yeah

2245.2 --> 2249.46
no it was all it was messy all the way

2247.48 --> 2252.18
so uh

2249.46 --> 2252.18
what

2253.26 --> 2258.0400000000004
euthanized depressed young people what

2255.52 --> 2259.3
young people what

2258.04 --> 2261.7799999999997
[ __ ]

2259.3 --> 2261.78
okay

2261.94 --> 2265.26
yeah that's messed up

2277.0 --> 2280.14
hello television

2286.78 --> 2291.38
what do you mean us no law what what do

2291.04 --> 2296.42
you mean

2291.38 --> 2296.42
[Music]

2299.77 --> 2305.82
[Music]

2301.68 --> 2305.8199999999997
18 is Young okay

2309.0 --> 2316.96
that but look Richard G I mean

2313.3 --> 2319.6600000000003
Canada is kind of messed up in many ways

2316.96 --> 2322.06
like that

2319.66 --> 2325.2599999999998
and to be fair it's always been kind of

2322.06 --> 2325.2599999999998
messed up like that really

2326.68 --> 2331.8999999999996
I always thought of as oh no they're

2328.66 --> 2334.359
just really liberal like even like in

2331.9 --> 2336.64
the 90s I remember

2334.359 --> 2338.98
through like the television program and

2336.64 --> 2340.72
it was like yeah no Oh Canada is really

2338.98 --> 2342.52
liberal like they're

2340.72 --> 2345.4599999999996
there were people literally like oh I

2342.52 --> 2349.359
wish we could be more like Canada like

2345.46 --> 2351.579
guess who yeah yeah but I didn't

2349.359 --> 2353.98
understand that back then so I just

2351.579 --> 2356.32
remember like well it was kind of so

2353.98 --> 2357.28
liberal and oh we want to be more like

2356.32 --> 2360.0
that

2357.28 --> 2360.0
ugh

2360.64 --> 2363.2999999999997
so

2364.42 --> 2368.8
it's just getting more attention now

2366.7 --> 2371.14
because of well the internet social

2368.8 --> 2375.52
media era

2371.14 --> 2378.16
so now the the egregiousness of their

2375.52 --> 2379.599
policies are just like there for the for

2378.16 --> 2382.0
the pickup

2379.599 --> 2385.119
or anybody who wants to dig in

2382.0 --> 2388.2
but it's kind of always been like that

2385.119 --> 2388.2000000000003
as far as I can remember

2393.339 --> 2400.18
fidget spinner was a phenomenon what

2397.96 --> 2401.32
she said that that's ridiculous

2400.18 --> 2404.3799999999997
television

2401.32 --> 2406.8
thank you for that an issue yeah I know

2404.38 --> 2406.8
that one

2411.52 --> 2415.32
hey Stevie traveler good to see you

2427.839 --> 2431.52
and oh yes hello Cleary

2452.92 --> 2458.92
are you guys having a good time

2455.92 --> 2461.7400000000002
40 minutes in 22 watching

2458.92 --> 2465.06
gonna get some rogans up ahead of time

2461.74 --> 2465.06
now that everybody's here

2467.27 --> 2470.739
[Music]

2473.8 --> 2478.03
thank you

2474.82 --> 2478.03
[Music]

2480.16 --> 2482.7599999999998
foreign

2488.16 --> 2493.06
country today that exists that you feel

2491.26 --> 2495.7200000000003
lines up best with your political

2493.06 --> 2495.72
beliefs

2508.0 --> 2514.24
it's fair to be fair steamy traveler

2510.94 --> 2517.7200000000003
I've I'm

2514.24 --> 2521.4399999999996
I don't have full oversight

2517.72 --> 2523.06
I mean there's like good traits

2521.44 --> 2526.359
that I know

2523.06 --> 2529.38
but then there's like Shadow sides that

2526.359 --> 2529.38
I know less about

2533.56 --> 2540.04
right so what I've basically on a more

2537.28 --> 2542.1400000000003
physical visceral level very young found

2540.04 --> 2545.38
out

2542.14 --> 2548.04
younger is that yeah it's basically the

2545.38 --> 2548.04
same everywhere

2550.0 --> 2556.9
as some people or some places just know

2553.48 --> 2559.359
how to hide their Darkness better than

2556.9 --> 2561.54
other places where it's more out in the

2559.359 --> 2561.54
open

2561.7 --> 2567.9399999999996
yeah it sounds very dark well that's

2564.82 --> 2570.099
what I figured out and was not good for

2567.94 --> 2574.2000000000003
me finding that out I could tell you

2570.099 --> 2574.2000000000003
although maybe necessary arguably

2574.96 --> 2578.7400000000002
because I was like I don't want to be

2576.82 --> 2581.56
part of this I want to where's the safe

2578.74 --> 2583.5989999999997
haven I want to go to the safe haven I

2581.56 --> 2586.0
want to go to the undying lands like

2583.599 --> 2589.1400000000003
where is it there isn't any

2586.0 --> 2589.14
it's all taken

2590.079 --> 2596.579
even Antarctica

2593.14 --> 2596.5789999999997
the southern lands there

2609.4 --> 2613.6600000000003
so yeah I don't have a real

2610.96 --> 2616.66
straightforward answer to that

2613.66 --> 2616.66
foreign

2632.46 --> 2636.819
it's just that there's some places where

2634.96 --> 2639.88
it's really bad but there's a really

2636.819 --> 2643.24
strong movement against it and

2639.88 --> 2644.92
and they take it and it like they they

2643.24 --> 2647.74
are taking it back

2644.92 --> 2649.48
but how that will finally roll out is

2647.74 --> 2650.9199999999996
kind of a mystery because it seems like

2649.48 --> 2653.44
there's going to be some kind of great

2650.92 --> 2655.2400000000002
Clash anyhow

2653.44 --> 2657.16
and there's other places that have been

2655.24 --> 2658.5989999999997
already like standing strong defending

2657.16 --> 2661.2999999999997
against it but they have their own

2658.599 --> 2664.42
issues that they

2661.3 --> 2666.46
yeah I mean those issues get highlighted

2664.42 --> 2668.6800000000003
and propagandized and pull out of

2666.46 --> 2671.579
proportion and it's just all a jumbled

2668.68 --> 2671.5789999999997
mess of information

2674.14 --> 2678.04
and you don't know they could

2676.66 --> 2680.6189999999997
like

2678.04 --> 2683.2
countries that are now seen as like good

2680.619 --> 2685.839
and resisting the New World Order

2683.2 --> 2688.18
well if everything like really

2685.839 --> 2690.2799999999997
destabilizes they could be actually the

2688.18 --> 2693.54
ones that are going to like try to take

2690.28 --> 2693.5400000000004
over their role

2697.18 --> 2701.7999999999997
that of course liberal the typical

2699.76 --> 2704.26
liberals that are part of the mainstream

2701.8 --> 2707.26
that's all they ever fear

2704.26 --> 2710.1400000000003
that they refer they fear Rover first

2707.26 --> 2713.0200000000004
because they've put all in all into

2710.14 --> 2714.22
their position on attacking at all costs

2713.02 --> 2716.5
right

2714.22 --> 2719.5
no mercy no

2716.5 --> 2719.5
Humanity

2719.56 --> 2725.68
and so they fear the role reverse

2723.52 --> 2727.079
but that is

2725.68 --> 2729.0989999999997
not

2727.079 --> 2731.98
unfounded there

2729.099 --> 2733.96
because if you sin that hard that much

2731.98 --> 2737.28
that openly like

2733.96 --> 2737.28
shit's gonna happen

2738.7 --> 2745.4199999999996
like once that tension breaks and all

2742.24 --> 2746.9799999999996
the pain comes out once you snap and

2745.42 --> 2751.06
everything that's inside of you comes

2746.98 --> 2753.64
out right but then on a macro scale

2751.06 --> 2756.04
yeah

2753.64 --> 2759.1189999999997
you don't know what's gonna happen

2756.04 --> 2759.119
after that

2762.94 --> 2766.96
things that have been highly suppressed

2764.98 --> 2768.76
could suddenly like to strike back

2766.96 --> 2770.2
harder than ever all those things that

2768.76 --> 2772.7200000000003
you had to suppress because there was

2770.2 --> 2774.819
literally nowhere you could put those

2772.72 --> 2777.64
tentacles or spiritual tentacles to

2774.819 --> 2780.819
manifest because all cut off if then

2777.64 --> 2784.66
suddenly it all goes away yeah

2780.819 --> 2786.7
something comes out that nobody tends to

2784.66 --> 2789.04
expect

2786.7 --> 2791.2599999999998
because it's all been suppressed

2789.04 --> 2793.3
and so people don't even know each

2791.26 --> 2795.6400000000003
other's identity anymore

2793.3 --> 2798.7000000000003
right that's what happens after like a

2795.64 --> 2800.68
Soviet situation ends

2798.7 --> 2803.5
and in a way

2800.68 --> 2805.96
the world is subjected to a soviet-like

2803.5 --> 2807.94
situation that's what globalism really

2805.96 --> 2811.0
is in a way

2807.94 --> 2814.38
although yeah of course

2811.0 --> 2814.38
the details

2816.52 --> 2822.16
it's very much in the same direction in

2819.819 --> 2824.859
the same spiritual directions it's very

2822.16 --> 2828.8799999999997
satanic that way

2824.859 --> 2831.04
I didn't know original Soviet Union and

2828.88 --> 2834.46
with Russia is still different because

2831.04 --> 2839.14
it was really kind of dark at the top

2834.46 --> 2842.2
people themselves were still able to

2839.14 --> 2844.92
retain their good spirit mostly

2842.2 --> 2844.9199999999996
throughout it

2845.8 --> 2849.6400000000003
hmm

2847.78 --> 2852.2200000000003
okay in that sense maybe it isn't

2849.64 --> 2854.7599999999998
different at all

2852.22 --> 2854.7599999999998
yeah

2854.92 --> 2859.359
but right but the patterns are very

2857.74 --> 2861.04
similar so you have to think of like

2859.359 --> 2863.74
what's going to happen once that goes

2861.04 --> 2865.48
away right once a field of suppression

2863.74 --> 2868.2999999999997
spiritually

2865.48 --> 2871.2400000000002
through communication and enforcement

2868.3 --> 2873.6400000000003
once that goes away then things that

2871.24 --> 2876.04
basically been forgotten because that

2873.64 --> 2877.18
was the purpose of it will come back and

2876.04 --> 2880.06
then

2877.18 --> 2883.359
everybody's oversight

2880.06 --> 2885.099
will be disrupted

2883.359 --> 2886.96
because everything's suddenly gonna turn

2885.099 --> 2888.46
out to be very different from what you

2886.96 --> 2890.619
thought it was

2888.46 --> 2893.619
that's what typically happens that's my

2890.619 --> 2895.599
prediction and that could happen

2893.619 --> 2898.42
in the not too distant future because it

2895.599 --> 2901.92
does really seem like it's buckling up

2898.42 --> 2901.92
there it's really buckling

2905.38 --> 2908.7400000000002
and

2907.359 --> 2910.839
yeah

2908.74 --> 2913.839
when they go buckling

2910.839 --> 2916.5
situations in the world tend to tend to

2913.839 --> 2916.5
go left field

2917.02 --> 2922.839
and I base this on only intuition

2920.319 --> 2925.96
there's no

2922.839 --> 2931.0789999999997
yeah historical reference that I could

2925.96 --> 2931.079
quote or something to back that up

2931.359 --> 2937.2999999999997
although undoubtedly it is true

2935.079 --> 2939.76
at the top when it goes buckling and

2937.3 --> 2943.0600000000004
power shift things go left field

2939.76 --> 2946.42
unexpected things suddenly manifest

2943.06 --> 2948.46
because they've been planned to just for

2946.42 --> 2950.319
that moment of release so a lot of

2948.46 --> 2953.619
people plan

2950.319 --> 2955.24
and they wait until they reset you could

2953.619 --> 2958.0
call it right

2955.24 --> 2959.9199999999996
this goes buckling at the top

2958.0 --> 2962.44
then quickly they start to plant their

2959.92 --> 2965.44
seeds and then when the top breaks apart

2962.44 --> 2967.06
and there's a shift a release and then

2965.44 --> 2969.52
suddenly everybody

2967.06 --> 2970.96
rolls out and then businesses suddenly

2969.52 --> 2974.98
start up

2970.96 --> 2979.119
manifest projects suddenly unroll

2974.98 --> 2980.5
media events suddenly happen all that

2979.119 --> 2984.2400000000002
sort of thing starts to happen because

2980.5 --> 2984.24
it's been suppressed for so long

2984.7 --> 2987.24
foreign

2988.14 --> 2994.839
like the overall spirit

2991.839 --> 2996.7
of everybody that is in that

2994.839 --> 2999.54
and then you don't really know what's

2996.7 --> 2999.54
going to come out of it

3000.0 --> 3006.3
right unless it's one uniform

3004.079 --> 3008.88
thing unrolling it what that would mean

3006.3 --> 3012.2400000000002
that there is basically another Power

3008.88 --> 3014.099
Player doing a new mind control rollout

3012.24 --> 3016.2
if it's singular yeah then you can

3014.099 --> 3018.42
predict where it's all gonna go

3016.2 --> 3020.819
but if it's actually Freedom then you

3018.42 --> 3024.78
really can't you really cannot

3020.819 --> 3028.22
accurately predict where it's gonna go

3024.78 --> 3028.2200000000003
it's always going to be a Gamble

3032.28 --> 3039.0600000000004
anyway

3034.5 --> 3039.06
so maybe if it's uh ethereal

3041.75 --> 3047.939
[Music]

3050.76 --> 3055.88
oh God Tate oh my God Terry

3056.22 --> 3058.8799999999997
ah

3083.72 --> 3089.54
okay Jared Sanford that's interesting

3086.579 --> 3089.54
sure

3090.599 --> 3095.34
eight three

3092.359 --> 3100.92
I might have

3095.34 --> 3104.2200000000003
[Music]

3100.92 --> 3107.839
spiritual suppression Theory

3104.22 --> 3107.839
what okay

3110.88 --> 3115.7400000000002
right

3113.04 --> 3119.22
I don't know if that's related it's just

3115.74 --> 3121.74
a psychological mechanism

3119.22 --> 3124.5589999999997
that means what's happening right people

3121.74 --> 3127.9199999999996
when you get suppressed in ways right

3124.559 --> 3131.28
you get frustrated

3127.92 --> 3134.099
because you're not manifesting

3131.28 --> 3137.76
so when that then stops whatever it is

3134.099 --> 3137.76
censorship gatekeeping

3138.3 --> 3145.2000000000003
or yeah

3141.78 --> 3148.1600000000003
punishing then eventually yeah you're

3145.2 --> 3151.14
gonna just stop it and wait wait until

3148.16 --> 3153.18
that all that suppression stops and then

3151.14 --> 3155.94
things all because usually it doesn't

3153.18 --> 3159.24
just stop with one person right but

3155.94 --> 3161.94
there's a reset then everybody suddenly

3159.24 --> 3164.2799999999997
has that opportunity and will start to

3161.94 --> 3166.7400000000002
manifest and then you get like a wild

3164.28 --> 3169.52
growth situation that's not

3166.74 --> 3169.52
predictable

3170.119 --> 3176.6400000000003
and maybe it just doesn't need to be

3172.74 --> 3179.3999999999996
maybe freedom is better because that

3176.64 --> 3183.02
predictability usually only goes in the

3179.4 --> 3183.02
benefit of the biggest shark

3183.359 --> 3186.839
yeah

3184.68 --> 3189.0589999999997
everything is predictable the biggest

3186.839 --> 3192.42
guys always win

3189.059 --> 3194.4
the ones with the most money and power

3192.42 --> 3196.98
because predictability is what they

3194.4 --> 3199.319
thrive on that's why they in a pragmat

3196.98 --> 3201.96
the pragmatic side and not just the

3199.319 --> 3203.7
personal hate of people that's why they

3201.96 --> 3206.339
make everybody [ __ ] because then it

3203.7 --> 3207.96
becomes more predictable and then they

3206.339 --> 3210.599
win

3207.96 --> 3211.7400000000002
because predictability is what they

3210.599 --> 3215.4
thrive on

3211.74 --> 3219.1189999999997
yeah that's why freedom is a problem

3215.4 --> 3221.1600000000003
to the big fat caps with the a lot of

3219.119 --> 3223.44
money and power

3221.16 --> 3226.0989999999997
because Freedom gets in the way of

3223.44 --> 3226.099
predictability

3226.68 --> 3231.859
you can't really fully anticipate

3229.38 --> 3231.859
freedom

3234.119 --> 3239.52
it will always be a Gamble

3237.18 --> 3242.64
right

3239.52 --> 3244.8
and yeah Monopoly men they don't like

3242.64 --> 3248.72
that they just want to do whatever they

3244.8 --> 3248.7200000000003
do has to be a win to them

3259.26 --> 3261.7400000000002
oh

3265.079 --> 3270.559
some guy talks about Joe Rogan show okay

3270.57 --> 3273.78
[Music]

3282.359 --> 3288.98
yeah I don't really watch Joe Rogan

3285.9 --> 3288.98
but thanks

3291.9 --> 3295.98
I mean

3293.22 --> 3299.3999999999996
I don't really like drug promoting

3295.98 --> 3302.339
streams and he does

3299.4 --> 3304.079
that's what he does I don't I I think

3302.339 --> 3305.2799999999997
that that's actually shouldn't be

3304.079 --> 3307.079
allowed

3305.28 --> 3311.1800000000003
like that

3307.079 --> 3311.1800000000003
not on a public platform anyway

3315.78 --> 3321.3
right in a precautionary

3318.839 --> 3326.7799999999997
expression sure

3321.3 --> 3326.78
but not just for promotion of using it

3334.68 --> 3338.54
I think that's highly irresponsible

3340.26 --> 3348.2000000000003
I think that at Joe Rogan

3342.839 --> 3352.04
like concerning drugs they are very much

3348.2 --> 3352.04
overtly irresponsible

3352.319 --> 3356.119
like they're barely precautionary

3356.16 --> 3362.2999999999997
they don't tell you anything about

3358.38 --> 3362.3
long-term serious consequences

3364.5 --> 3369.9
or or am I wrong about that you tell me

3367.619 --> 3372.6600000000003
at phrase because I don't actually watch

3369.9 --> 3376.339
it all of this is still based on things

3372.66 --> 3376.339
that I've seen like years ago

3380.16 --> 3385.339
I've watched a couple of things from Joe

3382.02 --> 3385.339
Rogan like years ago

3388.079 --> 3391.6800000000003
like when he was like hanging around

3390.0 --> 3393.599
with Alex Jones and all that and through

3391.68 --> 3396.48
Infowars I got some of that and even

3393.599 --> 3399.6600000000003
there it's just like

3396.48 --> 3402.359
this is [ __ ]

3399.66 --> 3404.7599999999998
it's just casually talking about these

3402.359 --> 3408.859
drugs and no it's so and and promoting

3404.76 --> 3408.8590000000004
it like highly dangerous stuff

3412.5 --> 3417.9
and and not actually laying down like

3415.619 --> 3421.1600000000003
hey oh you really want to do this this

3417.9 --> 3421.1600000000003
is [ __ ] dangerous

3426.78 --> 3433.1600000000003
do you see anything in a specific way

3429.059 --> 3433.1600000000003
like meditation yeah puke

3436.079 --> 3438.319
foreign

3439.7 --> 3445.319
Uncle Womble

3442.68 --> 3448.16
Rogan says sell out yeah

3445.319 --> 3448.16
very much

3453.9 --> 3458.7000000000003
but anyway head face it's super cute

3456.0 --> 3460.559
that he does that it's absurdly

3458.7 --> 3463.98
irresponsible I think that his show

3460.559 --> 3466.02
should be just canceled

3463.98 --> 3468.9
yeah that's what I said censor this show

3466.02 --> 3470.579
should be censored

3468.9 --> 3473.28
because

3470.579 --> 3475.94
he's very irresponsible

3473.28 --> 3478.5
talking about things very irresponsibly

3475.94 --> 3480.48
I'm not talking about conspiracy

3478.5 --> 3482.22
theories I'm talking about drugs it's

3480.48 --> 3485.48
extremely irresponsible

3482.22 --> 3485.48
to spread that information

3491.819 --> 3497.4
right it's one thing if you're like oh I

3494.28 --> 3499.8
oh I'm kind of into drugs I'm really

3497.4 --> 3501.78
curious and I'm gonna look for something

3499.8 --> 3503.819
right

3501.78 --> 3506.099
I need a teacher I need somebody to

3503.819 --> 3507.3
guide me and then yeah sure give

3506.099 --> 3510.0
guidance

3507.3 --> 3512.88
there if they want to do it but I mean

3510.0 --> 3513.839
people are gonna tune into Joe Rogan for

3512.88 --> 3516.599
whatever

3513.839 --> 3519.299
and hang around and then he

3516.599 --> 3522.059
starts talking about it

3519.299 --> 3525.66
people that didn't think of it before

3522.059 --> 3527.2200000000003
are now gonna get curiosity about these

3525.66 --> 3530.0589999999997
drugs

3527.22 --> 3534.1189999999997
that's bad

3530.059 --> 3534.119
very very bad

3535.14 --> 3540.7799999999997
I'd say that's on the level as terrible

3537.72 --> 3542.339
as as teaching children about

3540.78 --> 3544.6800000000003
genders

3542.339 --> 3547.7
yeah it's the same level

3544.68 --> 3547.7
in my opinion

3551.94 --> 3555.179
[Music]

3556.38 --> 3561.359
it might change my mind why why why

3558.599 --> 3563.7200000000003
would that make me change my mind at

3561.359 --> 3563.72
phrase

3565.02 --> 3571.319
I'm not gonna watch it but you can try

3567.66 --> 3573.5989999999997
to make your case by explaining

3571.319 --> 3575.2799999999997
why it would change my mind about

3573.599 --> 3578.1600000000003
everything that I said because I don't

3575.28 --> 3581.46
think there's as anything in existence I

3578.16 --> 3583.68
would change my mind about my views

3581.46 --> 3586.559
and I don't think that Joe Rogan has

3583.68 --> 3588.74
changed his stance in how he does it at

3586.559 --> 3588.7400000000002
all

3588.96 --> 3594.299
unless you want to correct me on that

3591.24 --> 3597.4799999999996
you seem to be more up to date with him

3594.299 --> 3599.16
you can correct me

3597.48 --> 3600.42
but you'll have to actually say

3599.16 --> 3603.799
something

3600.42 --> 3603.799
because I'm not gonna watch it

3610.23 --> 3613.65
[Music]

3619.319 --> 3624.7799999999997
yeah well you're not saying anything

3622.319 --> 3626.2799999999997
you're not actually laying it down you

3624.78 --> 3628.38
you're not saying anything that's

3626.28 --> 3630.5400000000004
changing my mind

3628.38 --> 3633.44
so why are you so convinced that it's

3630.54 --> 3633.44
going to change my mind

3641.21 --> 3645.729
[Music]

3650.03 --> 3659.17
[Music]

3670.799 --> 3675.66
oh

3672.42 --> 3677.2200000000003
Eddie Bravo still on Joe Rogan still

3675.66 --> 3679.5589999999997
talking about Flat Earth I mean yeah Joe

3677.22 --> 3683.5789999999997
Rogan is is a complete [ __ ] sellout

3679.559 --> 3686.7000000000003
Globe tart [ __ ] and he's he can't deal

3683.579 --> 3688.38
with it anymore he literally can't deal

3686.7 --> 3690.359
with flat Earth so I'm not surprised I'm

3688.38 --> 3692.04
surprised that he still even gets a

3690.359 --> 3695.17
problem

3692.04 --> 3695.17
[Music]

3704.04 --> 3710.52
no of course Eddie Bravo is still cool

3707.4 --> 3713.9
I mean he's not perfect or anything but

3710.52 --> 3713.9
I mean he is still cool

3714.119 --> 3718.28
especially compared to Joe Rogan

3720.42 --> 3724.76
but I do feel like Eddie Ravel is at

3722.7 --> 3727.5589999999997
least a guy that

3724.76 --> 3729.98
to an extent I could I could at least

3727.559 --> 3729.98
Trust

3730.559 --> 3736.799
like he's not he's not gonna like try to

3733.68 --> 3739.799
make some little plan or whatever to to

3736.799 --> 3743.54
get it to control you he's not like that

3739.799 --> 3743.54
Joe Rogan is like that

3753.28 --> 3756.3390000000004
[Music]

3766.38 --> 3771.44
you need to be able to talk about

3768.359 --> 3774.859
everything it's an easy doing joke

3771.44 --> 3774.859
rohan's job

3776.46 --> 3781.319
uh well it's not easy when you're sold

3779.4 --> 3785.339
out for a lot of money and you literally

3781.319 --> 3788.2799999999997
can't talk about things anymore yeah

3785.339 --> 3790.44
really sucks where you're like hey you

3788.28 --> 3792.7200000000003
are the appointed official guy that

3790.44 --> 3795.059
talks about everything and you can't

3792.72 --> 3797.8799999999997
talk about everything

3795.059 --> 3801.3190000000004
oh but you have to pretend like you can

3797.88 --> 3803.94
yeah that's his job can you imagine how

3801.319 --> 3807.119
unbelievably [ __ ] up

3803.94 --> 3809.28
a life like that has to be

3807.119 --> 3810.96
can talk about everything that everybody

3809.28 --> 3813.299
believes that you can talk about

3810.96 --> 3816.18
everything there that you're all free

3813.299 --> 3820.52
this is all straight but you are not

3816.18 --> 3820.52
you're not able to talk about everything

3820.559 --> 3825.059
and you have to still convince everybody

3823.38 --> 3828.359
that you can

3825.059 --> 3829.46
so yeah Joe Rogan is in a pretty [ __ ]

3828.359 --> 3833.66
up position

3829.46 --> 3835.619
[Music]

3833.66 --> 3838.64
ah

3835.619 --> 3842.1600000000003
yeah advice just shut the [ __ ] up dude

3838.64 --> 3844.5589999999997
you've not given me any content all you

3842.16 --> 3846.48
do is just whining you're just whining

3844.559 --> 3849.0
watch this

3846.48 --> 3851.52
it's nothing like that you haven't

3849.0 --> 3853.799
actually given me any content responded

3851.52 --> 3856.799
to anything I inquired

3853.799 --> 3859.14
yeah so just shut the [ __ ] up about it

3856.799 --> 3862.24
okay at face

3859.14 --> 3871.29
because you're wasting my chat space

3862.24 --> 3871.29
[Music]

3874.26 --> 3876.559
foreign

3893.52 --> 3900.9
I'd expect you lay it down

3898.2 --> 3903.299
and then connect it up

3900.9 --> 3906.6800000000003
right you don't have to like

3903.299 --> 3910.5
copy paste the giant page it's called

3906.68 --> 3912.4199999999996
summarize yeah you summarize it you

3910.5 --> 3914.339
can't summarize something in 200

3912.42 --> 3917.099
characters

3914.339 --> 3920.2799999999997
then you're a [ __ ]

3917.099 --> 3922.799
who the [ __ ] can't summarize even an

3920.28 --> 3924.6600000000003
elaborate theory in 200 characters yeah

3922.799 --> 3926.52
you don't have to throw everything in

3924.66 --> 3930.92
there yeah you don't have to be autistic

3926.52 --> 3930.92
about it you summarize

3931.079 --> 3935.1800000000003
how [ __ ] hard can it be at phrase

3939.5 --> 3942.699
[Music]

3942.72 --> 3949.0989999999997
yeah because you had a point remember

3945.66 --> 3949.0989999999997
you brought it up as a point

3951.359 --> 3957.72
and then I countered the entire premise

3955.38 --> 3959.94
and saying like it's not good the way he

3957.72 --> 3962.04
talks about drugs is not good you're

3959.94 --> 3964.02
saying oh this will change my mind but

3962.04 --> 3966.299
you can't even summarize it in 200

3964.02 --> 3969.9
characters really you're gonna change my

3966.299 --> 3972.359
mind I just have to oh your your way to

3969.9 --> 3975.54
convince me is to send me somewhere and

3972.359 --> 3977.94
then I have to read like 10 pages

3975.54 --> 3980.04
until I'm so sick of it I'm just gonna

3977.94 --> 3982.02
say oh yeah okay at first you're right

3980.04 --> 3984.299
because I can't [ __ ] read all that

3982.02 --> 3987.5389999999998
garbage was that you're gonna be your

3984.299 --> 3990.78
tactic gonna make me sit through like an

3987.539 --> 3994.5
hour of Joe Rogan or more

3990.78 --> 3997.44
to just force me

3994.5 --> 4000.88
to convert or something to whatever or

3997.44 --> 4005.48
give up no no you're gonna have to

4000.88 --> 4008.0
verbally with text summarize it in 200

4005.48 --> 4009.859
characters yeah if you can't do that

4008.0 --> 4012.16
then what the hell are you even doing

4009.859 --> 4012.16
here

4013.039 --> 4018.7000000000003
yeah I don't need some ad man for Joe

4016.22 --> 4018.7
Rogan

4020.799 --> 4024.819
okay

4022.579 --> 4024.819
foreign

4027.819 --> 4034.4
thinks something can convince me but you

4030.859 --> 4037.72
can't even explain it to me then

4034.4 --> 4037.7200000000003
just go away

4062.359 --> 4068.14
yes no big guys in the vacuum that is

4065.599 --> 4068.1400000000003
him yes

4071.359 --> 4078.2799999999997
that used to come on with chaiki

4074.96 --> 4078.28
I mean hilarious times

4080.24 --> 4087.5
and he would he's very lazy

4083.839 --> 4089.66
so like he is like a message boy in a

4087.5 --> 4091.52
way in this tactic so he just thinks oh

4089.66 --> 4093.6189999999997
this is a good source

4091.52 --> 4095.359
and that he doesn't actually assimilate

4093.619 --> 4097.339
the information

4095.359 --> 4099.3189999999995
it's just like oh that's a good thing

4097.339 --> 4101.6
and then he'll just make argumentations

4099.319 --> 4105.92
all hollowed out and fake saying

4101.6 --> 4108.5
pointing at that thing that he believes

4105.92 --> 4110.679
has an answer but he doesn't actually

4108.5 --> 4116.12
know anything about it because otherwise

4110.679 --> 4118.219
he'd lay it out yeah like what I do

4116.12 --> 4120.5599999999995
like oh I think this is really gonna

4118.219 --> 4122.14
change your mind oh really

4120.56 --> 4125.259
yeah

4122.14 --> 4128.4800000000005
here's why

4125.259 --> 4131.299
oh yeah it's called understanding your

4128.48 --> 4133.959999999999
[ __ ] argument and laying it down with

4131.299 --> 4133.96
a summary

4134.02 --> 4139.660000000001
yeah yeah get the [ __ ] out of here at

4136.699 --> 4139.66
you're a [ __ ]

4146.09 --> 4152.08
[Music]

4148.46 --> 4152.08
stop wasting my damn time

4153.13 --> 4156.229
[Music]

4159.04 --> 4163.12
right anybody else

4174.14 --> 4180.859
the no eater internal dialogue

4178.16 --> 4184.239
could be yeah that that's a that's very

4180.859 --> 4184.2390000000005
perceptive of you yeah

4189.319 --> 4193.6990000000005
it could it could be or it may it might

4192.08 --> 4196.219
have a dialogue but he might just not

4193.699 --> 4199.339999999999
have a good control over it

4196.219 --> 4202.94
right some people do have it but they

4199.34 --> 4204.860000000001
can't make it do anything it just is a

4202.94 --> 4208.28
dialogue

4204.86 --> 4211.0
and it does whatever it wants

4208.28 --> 4211.0
no control

4211.28 --> 4216.139999999999
but that sometimes means effectively no

4214.46 --> 4218.3
internal dialogue if you don't have

4216.14 --> 4220.76
control over internal dialogue yet then

4218.3 --> 4223.6990000000005
it's not really a dialogue it's just

4220.76 --> 4226.3
something that keeps rolling by itself

4223.699 --> 4226.299999999999
anyway

4226.64 --> 4230.96
I uh

4228.62 --> 4233.48
I'm done with Ed here

4230.96 --> 4235.84
he effectively just wasted 50 minutes of

4233.48 --> 4235.839999999999
my time

4253.46 --> 4259.58
right so uh yeah any more interest in

4256.34 --> 4262.360000000001

4259.58 --> 4262.36
gatekeeper of Christ

4264.62 --> 4270.92

completely

4288.44 --> 4294.98
hey guns of nephron good to see you

4291.14 --> 4298.64

4294.98 --> 4302.139999999999

4307.98 --> 4313.169999999999
[Music]

4317.78 --> 4320.78

4344.0 --> 4347.02
it's cold like this

4347.12 --> 4349.9

4386.9 --> 4390.4
specific you would like me to address

4392.0 --> 4394.78
Bring It On

4395.239 --> 4399.639999999999
you want me to discuss some things I

4397.46 --> 4403.58
could talk about

4399.64 --> 4406.1
my specific model traits

4403.58 --> 4407.719
which can be summarized basically in a

4406.1 --> 4411.5
few sentences

4407.719 --> 4414.08
yeah I can do that I can summarize the

4411.5 --> 4417.38
the unique aspects of my entire theory

4414.08 --> 4420.199
in 200 characters yeah my entire thing

4417.38 --> 4422.900000000001
oh how hard is it oh

4420.199 --> 4425.839999999999
Ed can't even summarize

4422.9 --> 4427.879999999999
the point

4425.84 --> 4430.46
of something

4427.88 --> 4432.32
is just one item of one show he can't

4430.46 --> 4433.88
even summarize it yeah I can summarize

4432.32 --> 4436.28
everything

4433.88 --> 4439.159000000001
in 200 characters that I've basically

4436.28 --> 4441.32
talked about in the last eight years

4439.159 --> 4445.0599999999995
the three concepts right

4441.32 --> 4445.0599999999995
holographic celestials

4445.6 --> 4451.34
looping

4447.28 --> 4453.94
looping self-contained Realm non-space

4451.34 --> 4453.9400000000005
boom

4457.699 --> 4461.419999999999
there you go you get the three

4459.26 --> 4463.6990000000005
substation

4461.42 --> 4467.36
yeah elements

4463.699 --> 4470.9
of my realm model there you go

4467.36 --> 4476.98
with those just that that's it

4470.9 --> 4476.98
right of course each each specific

4477.32 --> 4483.98
each specific thing in that list

4481.28 --> 4486.8
warrant some explanation and that's

4483.98 --> 4489.44
gonna take a lot longer

4486.8 --> 4492.860000000001
but I mean it's not that hard I just

4489.44 --> 4494.659
summarized my unique concepts of my

4492.86 --> 4498.5599999999995
realm model

4494.659 --> 4500.54
in just one sentence pretty much

4498.56 --> 4504.620000000001
just a couple of words

4500.54 --> 4507.219
now see it's called summarizing how hard

4504.62 --> 4507.219
can it be

4523.159 --> 4525.58
h

4527.6 --> 4529.6
IND

4531.92 --> 4539.84
Better Way what I said it's called a

4535.84 --> 4542.6
summarizing summarization yeah

4539.84 --> 4546.14
it's the summarization of the pretty

4542.6 --> 4550.04
unique Concepts that I've brought forth

4546.14 --> 4552.02
on my shows in like on my YouTube

4550.04 --> 4556.54
channel pretty much

4552.02 --> 4556.540000000001
and on Nathan Oakleys a little

4557.719 --> 4561.86
how is that any better than what you

4559.58 --> 4564.5599999999995
said well the thing is you didn't say

4561.86 --> 4568.639999999999
anything all you just said is

4564.56 --> 4572.02
watch the video you'll change your mind

4568.64 --> 4572.02
that's all you [ __ ] said

4573.86 --> 4578.599999999999
so yeah what I just said is a lot better

4576.14 --> 4582.219
than what you just said because it's a

4578.6 --> 4582.219
summarization I had a point

4582.98 --> 4589.699
you didn't you're just an ad man

4586.64 --> 4591.08
going around saying watch that you'll

4589.699 --> 4592.339999999999
change your mind well why don't you go

4591.08 --> 4594.26
[ __ ] yourself

4592.34 --> 4597.21
explain it

4594.26 --> 4605.4890000000005
summarize it or shut the [ __ ] up

4597.21 --> 4605.4890000000005

well people are

4611.239 --> 4616.759999999999
considering it

4613.64 --> 4620.3
problem with the looping realm is that

4616.76 --> 4623.0
it's a mind Bender pun intended and a

4620.3 --> 4625.820000000001
lot of people don't really

4623.0 --> 4628.699
get it and I don't blame them it's

4625.82 --> 4630.4
really [ __ ] surreal I don't brain

4628.699 --> 4633.339999999999
blade him you know

4630.4 --> 4637.78
looping I mean what is this I'm kind of

4633.34 --> 4637.78
surreal nonsense yeah I get it

4637.88 --> 4643.84
but I can't explain it and I have

4641.239 --> 4643.839999999999
in detail

4653.36 --> 4658.659
Jesus Christ Ed are you literally

activity in my chat I asked you to

4667.1 --> 4672.320000000001

4670.4 --> 4675.5

4796.28 --> 4800.12
boy no

4798.14 --> 4802.04
no he watched it and probably thinks

4800.12 --> 4803.78
he's a genius now because everything

4802.04 --> 4805.699
that he watches makes him feel like he's

4803.78 --> 4807.5599999999995
a genius for some reason

4805.699 --> 4809.12
because that's what typically happens to

4807.56 --> 4812.2390000000005
retards

4809.12 --> 4815.0599999999995
watch something then they think that

4812.239 --> 4817.82
that power in that moment is them and

4815.06 --> 4819.5
then they blabber on about it thinking

4817.82 --> 4821.179
they know something about it but they

4819.5 --> 4822.62
don't

4821.179 --> 4826.219
they're just

4822.62 --> 4829.699
blabbering inspired by some vague echo

4826.219 --> 4831.7390000000005
of purpose and and Power

4829.699 --> 4833.36
they don't actually even know what the

4831.739 --> 4836.0599999999995
hell they're talking about that's a

4833.36 --> 4839.0599999999995
phrase in a nutshell

4836.06 --> 4842.620000000001
it's queuing I don't know I don't really

4839.06 --> 4842.620000000001
care I don't think so

4842.84 --> 4847.52
maybe he is I don't care

4844.88 --> 4850.6990000000005
he seems to be a fan of him according to

4847.52 --> 4853.46
him but I mean he's incoherent

4850.699 --> 4854.96
and ugly and he admitted to that and hey

4853.46 --> 4858.32
if he wants to hang around here

4854.96 --> 4861.5
sometimes fine he'll be my

4858.32 --> 4864.679
my paraplegic bear or whatever

4861.5 --> 4867.28
but I'm not particularly interested

4864.679 --> 4867.28
anyway

4875.48 --> 4878.62
are you zipped happy

4879.86 --> 4887.659
well summarized yeah yeah see oh how

4882.679 --> 4889.46
hard so hard I mean oh no no I have to

4887.659 --> 4890.96
waste somebody's time for like 30

4889.46 --> 4893.2390000000005
minutes

4890.96 --> 4895.699
to then end up not being able to

4893.239 --> 4897.5
summarize even the freaking point that I

4895.699 --> 4900.32
was trying to make without actually

4897.5 --> 4902.3
giving the content of the point

4900.32 --> 4905.299999999999
and here is somebody brings something up

4902.3 --> 4908.2390000000005
ask a question and I instantly summarize

4905.3 --> 4911.62
I mean how freaking hard is it man

4908.239 --> 4911.62
can't be that hard

4913.88 --> 4918.34
it's called having information available

4916.64 --> 4920.2390000000005
to you

4918.34 --> 4922.179
faculties

4920.239 --> 4926.98
and then

4922.179 --> 4930.7390000000005
using them to communicate information

4926.98 --> 4933.459999999999
oh yes you can't just have a point and

4930.739 --> 4933.459999999999
not have information

4937.34 --> 4941.659000000001
yeah it's really stupid to try and make

4939.739 --> 4944.239
a point about something that you don't

4941.659 --> 4946.879999999999
have the information ready in your mind

4944.239 --> 4948.5599999999995
that just makes you look like a complete

4946.88 --> 4952.0
[ __ ]

4948.56 --> 4955.580000000001
you can't Bluff like you have a point

4952.0 --> 4957.92
and then not have the information to

4955.58 --> 4961.1
make that point at the ready

4957.92 --> 4963.5
it makes you look like an idiot at face

4961.1 --> 4965.7390000000005
who is now banned because you waste my

4963.5 --> 4965.739
time

4968.05 --> 4980.609
[Music]

4984.62 --> 4991.94
that's a fan but yeah no he is so he's

4989.179 --> 4994.4800000000005
also an idiot

4991.94 --> 4994.48
anyway

5003.159 --> 5008.5
I mean to be fair it is kind of NASA's

5006.219 --> 5011.44
Department you know

5008.5 --> 5014.44
they are like Shepherds of retards

5011.44 --> 5016.719
that's what they do and well since at

5014.44 --> 5018.94
face can't even

5016.719 --> 5021.699
explain his point

5018.94 --> 5023.379999999999
in something that he brought up

5021.699 --> 5026.199
well

5023.38 --> 5028.0
yeah I think NASA is very well suited to

5026.199 --> 5029.919999999999
deal with those people

5028.0 --> 5033.96
right because you need to do some

5029.92 --> 5033.96
Fantastical Keys being in front

5034.3 --> 5039.400000000001
space it's space Oh just think in your

5037.239 --> 5042.4
head as like all the method it's space

5039.4 --> 5044.139999999999
it's real yeah yeah that's that's what

5042.4 --> 5048.9
that's Ford

5044.14 --> 5048.900000000001
they are there for people like advice

5050.98 --> 5058.78
Shepherds of retards amazing description

5054.0 --> 5062.04
thank you yeah I think I'm on fire

5058.78 --> 5062.04
today a bit

5073.06 --> 5078.1
ah and they like to be on fire because

5075.28 --> 5081.54
it's freaking cold out there man

5078.1 --> 5081.54
but yeah I do feel good

5090.6 --> 5096.58
also I part of the reason by the way I'm

5094.06 --> 5099.6990000000005
rolling into a new thing

5096.58 --> 5102.64
I think I'm feeling really good

5099.699 --> 5106.419999999999
because I have actually been pretty I've

5102.64 --> 5109.54
been expanding my prayer and now

5106.42 --> 5112.54
having a second part

5109.54 --> 5116.04
where I actually more seriously try to

5112.54 --> 5116.04
emulate what my healer does

5116.38 --> 5122.4400000000005
it's still a bit ethereal because he is

5118.96 --> 5126.28
he really does have a very well

5122.44 --> 5128.5599999999995
developed discipline in what he does

5126.28 --> 5130.3
but I have been able to emulate it

5128.56 --> 5132.400000000001
somewhat in the past successfully

5130.3 --> 5134.62
surprisingly like he didn't even suggest

5132.4 --> 5137.259999999999
that

5134.62 --> 5139.239
but now he has said like no you you

5137.26 --> 5141.820000000001
should do that

5139.239 --> 5145.239
last time we called and I am now

5141.82 --> 5148.239
actually trying to actively do it and

5145.239 --> 5150.339999999999
I'm not sure I have to check it but I

5148.239 --> 5152.639999999999
feel it's like getting really serious

5150.34 --> 5152.64
results

5154.719 --> 5161.02
like I can actually

5157.36 --> 5164.62
get my spirit and my soul back in my

5161.02 --> 5167.080000000001
body and and seal it like so that it is

5164.62 --> 5169.3
where it's supposed to be I think I

5167.08 --> 5172.36
could do it because I naturally my mind

5169.3 --> 5174.58
always goes in all directions and before

5172.36 --> 5177.94
you know it I'm dwelling on really weird

5174.58 --> 5180.58
things just to puzzle it out

5177.94 --> 5182.62
sometimes like immoral things I'm like

5180.58 --> 5184.659
always looking at detail like my spirit

5182.62 --> 5188.08
goes all over the place when I'm on my

5184.659 --> 5190.659
own and really dwelling but that is like

5188.08 --> 5193.239
outside of my body and that way I also

5190.659 --> 5194.799999999999
become more vulnerable to

5193.239 --> 5198.04
just

5194.8 --> 5200.92
bad Impressions or whatever

5198.04 --> 5202.3
that might slip in like through my

5200.92 --> 5204.9400000000005
imagination

5202.3 --> 5207.34
it's weird but

5204.94 --> 5209.678999999999
yeah I'm talking about internal

5207.34 --> 5212.38
spiritual and Consciousness processes

5209.679 --> 5217.179
right where your focus is at

5212.38 --> 5219.1
and I dream go around a lot dream walk I

5217.179 --> 5220.96
I call that and it is kind of

5219.1 --> 5222.159000000001
dreamwalker just personally get my head

5220.96 --> 5224.38
worrying

5222.159 --> 5226.659
feeling figuring out trying to test

5224.38 --> 5229.96
things is like trying to where's this

5226.659 --> 5233.5
energy going it's all very ethereal but

5229.96 --> 5235.36
it's very distinct for me

5233.5 --> 5238.179
but doing that

5235.36 --> 5241.5
yeah it does really kind of like get

5238.179 --> 5241.5
your spirit out of your body

5241.719 --> 5248.56
and that makes I guess your organs and

5246.52 --> 5249.76
your entire system function slightly

5248.56 --> 5251.56
less

5249.76 --> 5253.9800000000005
as it should be

5251.56 --> 5253.9800000000005
right

5254.56 --> 5258.34
it's interesting how that works and so

5256.719 --> 5261.82
there is a technique now that I can

5258.34 --> 5265.6
literally Focus to really get it in

5261.82 --> 5268.54
there to basically become whole again

5265.6 --> 5272.1
and it works

5268.54 --> 5272.1
works really quickly

5280.78 --> 5284.099999999999
what the hell

5291.42 --> 5297.6
Jesus

5293.26 --> 5297.6
Thunder for PJP

5299.08 --> 5304.54
that's [ __ ] up dude

5301.96 --> 5307.84
that sucks no I don't have that problem

5304.54 --> 5310.6
I'm actually yeah I might not be the

5307.84 --> 5312.58
tallest guy in the world but I'm very

5310.6 --> 5314.7390000000005
flexible

5312.58 --> 5321.34
literally so

5314.739 --> 5323.5
I never fall like I never fall

5321.34 --> 5325.659000000001
I mean it must be like a real

5323.5 --> 5327.699
circumstantial thing that I might slip

5325.659 --> 5330.04
or something

5327.699 --> 5332.799999999999
but that's very rare because I'm

5330.04 --> 5335.139
extremely I've been very trained in in

5332.8 --> 5337.900000000001
balance and everything I don't fall I

5335.139 --> 5340.26
don't lose my balance I'm like obsessed

5337.9 --> 5340.259999999999
with that

5340.9 --> 5346.42
like almost paranoid but not in a way

5344.44 --> 5349.54
that it's in the way it's all into and

5346.42 --> 5351.6990000000005
just balance was like a major Focus for

5349.54 --> 5353.739
me in my

5351.699 --> 5356.138999999999
training

5353.739 --> 5358.419999999999
to what I learned at taekwondo

5356.139 --> 5359.92
and I really like held on to that the

5358.42 --> 5363.1
rest of my life

5359.92 --> 5365.4400000000005
and I use my balance continually

5363.1 --> 5369.280000000001
so no I don't fall and I definitely

5365.44 --> 5371.919999999999
wouldn't need to stand on cans in order

5369.28 --> 5373.33
to reach something in a in a supermarket

5371.92 --> 5374.679
aisle

5373.33 --> 5377.44
[Music]

5374.679 --> 5379.78
I mean if it's that if that I had an

5377.44 --> 5383.259999999999
issue with my back sometimes right so

5379.78 --> 5386.739
last time I had that and I was like

5383.26 --> 5387.76
I let it be known on the show it's a few

5386.739 --> 5391.0
months ago

5387.76 --> 5392.5
that time I did actually like had I'm

5391.0 --> 5396.34
like I'm not going to be able to reach

5392.5 --> 5397.96
the thing I need so I asked

5396.34 --> 5400.38
somebody who works there hey could you

5397.96 --> 5404.04
reach for it I have trouble with my back

5400.38 --> 5404.04
problem solved

5407.62 --> 5413.34
that's weird

5409.78 --> 5413.34
where the hell did this guy come from

5415.42 --> 5419.9400000000005
it sounds like something in a cartoon a

5417.46 --> 5419.94
little yeah

5432.12 --> 5436.3
are you saying in Elmer are you saying

5434.98 --> 5440.86
that dunners

5436.3 --> 5444.719
for pgp is Elmer Fudd

5440.86 --> 5444.719
that's a bit presumptuous of you

5449.08 --> 5453.5199999999995
although yeah it's a bit of a weird

5450.82 --> 5457.679
story but whatever man

5453.52 --> 5457.679
feels he needs to share that sure

5464.02 --> 5471.6990000000005
what's wrong with believing in Aliens

5468.219 --> 5473.92
really oh is it us you you believe in

5471.699 --> 5476.699
what does that mean

5473.92 --> 5476.6990000000005
to you

5478.0 --> 5484.36
what about aliens do you believe in

5481.54 --> 5487.36
I rarely talk about that subject because

5484.36 --> 5491.099999999999
people don't really bring it up

5487.36 --> 5491.099999999999
what I have things to say about it

5505.0 --> 5510.4
aliens are cool

5507.4 --> 5510.4
okay

5513.28 --> 5517.32
but I'd like to hear from us actually

5527.739 --> 5536.199
wow your people people got silly quickly

5532.739 --> 5538.739
I think we entered Looney Tune territory

5536.199 --> 5538.739
right now

5562.3 --> 5568.56
so as you don't want to talk about

5564.699 --> 5568.5599999999995
aliens you kind of brought it up

5579.0 --> 5583.8
they are old Mac Demons What

5585.46 --> 5588.84
no but seriously

5590.26 --> 5595.12
is answering someone else okay okay

5593.8 --> 5597.400000000001
fine

5595.12 --> 5600.42
well I'm fishing for subjects here too

5597.4 --> 5600.42
so I thought hey

5601.3 --> 5606.360000000001
we'll talk about it

5603.88 --> 5606.36
right

5606.639 --> 5611.9400000000005
I mean there's like a whole situation

5608.92 --> 5614.32
with aliens going on considering

5611.94 --> 5617.44
heliocentrism and and the root of that

5614.32 --> 5620.139
side of the story but also psychedelic

5617.44 --> 5622.9
experiences that root of the story

5620.139 --> 5625.84
concerning aliens like which type of

5622.9 --> 5628.78
aliens how aliens whole stories are

5625.84 --> 5630.400000000001
unrolled but supposed galactic

5628.78 --> 5632.739
federations

5630.4 --> 5635.379999999999
and people have made art about that and

5632.739 --> 5636.879999999999
she hadn't like have no idea of what

5635.38 --> 5639.88
they look like and

5636.88 --> 5641.62
there is a lot concerning aliens with

5639.88 --> 5644.86
different roots

5641.62 --> 5646.9
in different places so

5644.86 --> 5649.299999999999
which one are you into

5646.9 --> 5653.259999999999
right are you into like alien abduction

5649.3 --> 5657.219
and cattle mutilation and

5653.26 --> 5659.400000000001
and Men In Black showing up or are you

5657.219 --> 5661.6
into like

5659.4 --> 5663.46
psychedelic the other side and

5661.6 --> 5665.5
supposedly what's there

5663.46 --> 5667.56
beings

5665.5 --> 5672.42
or like

5667.56 --> 5672.42
bizarre out of nowhere dream experiences

5672.76 --> 5676.84
like you're actually seeing some kind of

5674.98 --> 5679.599999999999
shady thing

5676.84 --> 5683.34
like what what direction

5679.6 --> 5683.34
what direction should I take it in

5697.06 --> 5700.900000000001
the only thing you mean the ontological

5699.58 --> 5704.76
primitive

5700.9 --> 5704.759999999999
you mean that one television

5709.54 --> 5712.739
[Applause]

5720.36 --> 5726.0
Omni is a different type of omni means

5723.58 --> 5728.5599999999995
everything right all-encompassing

5726.0 --> 5733.48
omnipresent all-encompassing presence

5728.56 --> 5733.4800000000005
right but ontological it's ontology

5736.239 --> 5741.699
could I explain it well you have to

5739.3 --> 5747.28
realize it's not within physics

5741.699 --> 5749.32
it's philosophy derived from physics

5747.28 --> 5752.199
and logic

5749.32 --> 5757.179
right so ontological primitive

5752.199 --> 5759.94
is basically how did it come into being

5757.179 --> 5761.679
right and there's two and this yeah

5759.94 --> 5764.138999999999
this is not the false dichotomy other

5761.679 --> 5766.06
well there's a there are other options

5764.139 --> 5768.58
I'll mention them The ontological

5766.06 --> 5770.5
Primitives are ways to argue how

5768.58 --> 5771.88
everything that is right here has come

5770.5 --> 5774.52
into being

5771.88 --> 5777.400000000001
and there's two there's naturalism

5774.52 --> 5780.580000000001
or uh I might have the word slightly or

5777.4 --> 5784.0599999999995
the the nature created itself

5780.58 --> 5787.36
and that there was an original designer

5784.06 --> 5790.780000000001
right well nature creating itself

5787.36 --> 5792.46
cannot be demonstrated now of course the

5790.78 --> 5796.54
original designer

5792.46 --> 5798.46
cannot be like oh there he is right but

5796.54 --> 5801.5199999999995
design

5798.46 --> 5803.26
things that can of have like gradually

5801.52 --> 5805.900000000001
shaped

5803.26 --> 5807.84
is definitely present

5805.9 --> 5811.179
like within life

5807.84 --> 5812.7390000000005
to an imaginable depths

5811.179 --> 5814.659
right

5812.739 --> 5816.699
so that's ontological primitive it's

5814.659 --> 5818.799999999999
like how has it all come into being now

5816.699 --> 5821.259999999999
there's an alternative

5818.8 --> 5823.0
while their philosophy that's ridiculous

5821.26 --> 5824.38
that is that no everything's always been

5823.0 --> 5826.9
there

5824.38 --> 5829.54
which is literally like you can't

5826.9 --> 5831.5199999999995
justify that

5829.54 --> 5835.06
because there's entropy so everything

5831.52 --> 5837.820000000001
cannot have always have been there

5835.06 --> 5839.860000000001
because there's entropy this that would

5837.82 --> 5842.08
entropy would contradict that notion

5839.86 --> 5843.639
even though people on the scene

5842.08 --> 5845.8
sometimes bring it up well the third

5843.639 --> 5847.84
option yeah now it's entropy makes that

5845.8 --> 5849.34
impossible

5847.84 --> 5851.76
right

5849.34 --> 5854.32
but the autological Primitive basically

5851.76 --> 5856.84
says like yeah well

5854.32 --> 5859.48
God

5856.84 --> 5861.400000000001
a original designer has to exist because

5859.48 --> 5864.36
everything is full of design and it

5861.4 --> 5864.36
can't design itself

5865.42 --> 5870.34
Evolution cannot be demonstrated If

5868.179 --> 5872.04
evolution is a gradual process then you

5870.34 --> 5875.679
should be able to

5872.04 --> 5877.54
demonstrate specie transition and

5875.679 --> 5879.6990000000005
demonstrate how mutation actually

5877.54 --> 5883.0
results in

5879.699 --> 5886.12
a cohesive newer species which it never

5883.0 --> 5890.139
does because mutation always

5886.12 --> 5893.38
like deranges the spiritual function

5890.139 --> 5895.900000000001
of a creature deranges their spirit and

5893.38 --> 5898.900000000001
it often leads to sterility

5895.9 --> 5901.599999999999
so that completely contradicts the idea

5898.9 --> 5903.94
of evolution which lies under the

5901.6 --> 5906.6990000000005
naturalism

5903.94 --> 5908.799999999999
ontological primitive right

5906.699 --> 5909.889999999999
so that's the ontological Primitive

5908.8 --> 5911.56
where did it all come from

5909.89 --> 5915.12
[Music]

5911.56 --> 5915.120000000001
through logical reasoning

5916.54 --> 5921.04
right now entropy is very much

5919.06 --> 5923.26
compatible with

5921.04 --> 5925.659
an original designer

5923.26 --> 5928.2390000000005
because it would have all been designed

5925.659 --> 5930.638999999999
then it manifests it becomes into being

5928.239 --> 5932.638999999999
somehow it doesn't even matter how but

5930.639 --> 5936.84
it was designed it comes into being

5932.639 --> 5936.84
entropy starts taking place

5937.78 --> 5942.48
and that can be logically Justified

5942.88 --> 5948.34
unlike Evolution which they're like

5945.58 --> 5950.38
everything that we find in the tests and

5948.34 --> 5952.6
like how can it change one thing into

5950.38 --> 5954.1
another it all fails

5952.6 --> 5956.139
distinctly

5954.1 --> 5957.6990000000005
see

5956.139 --> 5959.9400000000005
so that is it

5957.699 --> 5962.799999999999
roughly there might be more

5959.94 --> 5965.0199999999995
details that are involved

5962.8 --> 5967.900000000001
sorry if I'm not getting it entirely

5965.02 --> 5971.400000000001
correct QE and Nathan

5967.9 --> 5971.4
but that's pretty much it

5979.179 --> 5983.139
I always said that the Universe could

5981.4 --> 5986.0199999999995
have stayed

5983.139 --> 5987.46
from a big crunch yeah that oh that's

5986.02 --> 5989.080000000001
funny that you say that evil nightmare

5987.46 --> 5991.659
because I've been saying that like since

5989.08 --> 5995.32
I was eight

5991.659 --> 5997.299999999999
no that's not fair enough no uh 14.

5995.32 --> 5999.82
that's roughly when I figure that out

5997.3 --> 6001.860000000001
like yeah of course it's not gonna just

5999.82 --> 6002.82
oh it just started there was always

6001.86 --> 6004.44
nothing

6002.82 --> 6008.78
and then suddenly there was something

6004.44 --> 6011.219
and then there's just endless

6008.78 --> 6012.84
stretched out

6011.219 --> 6015.4800000000005
nothing

6012.84 --> 6018.42
barely anything yeah I thought that was

6015.48 --> 6020.94
a ridiculous notion so yeah cyclical Big

6018.42 --> 6022.86
Bang seems only logical big bang big

6020.94 --> 6025.0199999999995
crunch big bang big crunch like the

6022.86 --> 6027.299999999999
universe engine

6025.02 --> 6029.46
that's how I thought of it from within

6027.3 --> 6032.400000000001
heliocentric conception

6029.46 --> 6033.96
and I still as Baldwin hold on to that

6032.4 --> 6036.179
absolutely

6033.96 --> 6037.5
but in reality that's not the case in

6036.179 --> 6040.9800000000005
reality

6037.5 --> 6045.0
I see it as there was

6040.98 --> 6047.4
the yeah the elemental planes there was

6045.0 --> 6049.38
just the elemental play I can't

6047.4 --> 6050.879999999999
I can't

6049.38 --> 6052.9800000000005
do it any other way there's the

6050.88 --> 6054.96
elemental planes just

6052.98 --> 6056.94
matter

6054.96 --> 6061.199
but

6056.94 --> 6063.12
just in it more pure form separate then

6061.199 --> 6064.5
there was a spirit in the spiritual

6063.12 --> 6067.62
dimension

6064.5 --> 6069.42
right the astral realm where there is an

6067.62 --> 6071.699
intelligence God

6069.42 --> 6073.08
seemingly to us

6071.699 --> 6075.96
infinite

6073.08 --> 6078.659
but maybe infinite maybe infinite isn't

6075.96 --> 6081.0
such an issue for God

6078.659 --> 6084.239
right but we are entropy bound Infinity

6081.0 --> 6086.639
is an issue for us even for our Spirits

6084.239 --> 6088.339999999999
even though they're connected

6086.639 --> 6093.139
right

6088.34 --> 6093.139
and now I lost my point this is

6093.719 --> 6096.5
yeah Infinity

6097.08 --> 6105.659
right uh God is arriving he basically

6102.38 --> 6108.119
starts to manifest I think he started

6105.659 --> 6110.159
with the Shapers the Elohim first

6108.119 --> 6112.5599999999995
manifests within the mid within the

6110.159 --> 6115.799999999999
material planes

6112.56 --> 6118.139
or the elemental planes and then taming

6115.8 --> 6121.28
those elements

6118.139 --> 6121.28
ordering them

6121.38 --> 6126.119
and then creating the realm physically

6123.659 --> 6129.54
but that's not God that's the Abrahim

6126.119 --> 6132.179
that's the the avatars because God is

6129.54 --> 6134.659
outside of physical reality he doesn't

6132.179 --> 6134.659
come in

6137.28 --> 6141.3
so he had sent the Shapers and the

6139.44 --> 6144.08
shaper shaped it all

6141.3 --> 6146.58
and then the shapers

6144.08 --> 6148.139
manifested the design

6146.58 --> 6151.98
of life

6148.139 --> 6154.34
and all of it and the destiny and the

6151.98 --> 6154.339999999999
rules

6154.5 --> 6158.82
manifested or maybe there was always

6156.48 --> 6162.239
there but that was that's a weird notion

6158.82 --> 6164.34
you know it's like did God create

6162.239 --> 6168.0599999999995
relative density

6164.34 --> 6170.76
situation or gravity whatever did did he

6168.06 --> 6173.400000000001
do that or was it always there even

6170.76 --> 6175.8
before creation yeah

6173.4 --> 6177.9
now there's a distinct description of

6175.8 --> 6180.900000000001
how the celestials like the sun and all

6177.9 --> 6183.9
that were created were put there

6180.9 --> 6186.599999999999
so but there's no the other traits we

6183.9 --> 6190.199
don't know like was it always there in

6186.6 --> 6192.780000000001
the elemental planes was there just that

6190.199 --> 6195.0
division of density is it there

6192.78 --> 6198.36
or was it set there's no mention of it

6195.0 --> 6199.8
like oh and then the light separated

6198.36 --> 6201.78
from the heavy

6199.8 --> 6202.8
right there's no moment of that in

6201.78 --> 6205.08
Genesis

6202.8 --> 6208.1
or maybe it used to be there and it was

6205.08 --> 6208.1
taken out I don't know

6208.739 --> 6212.759999999999
he thought like well no let's not do

6210.54 --> 6215.34
that in there last moment at the Council

6212.76 --> 6218.1
of nicaea who knows

6215.34 --> 6220.1990000000005
I'm not sure or maybe the apostles

6218.1 --> 6223.1
themselves were having doubts about

6220.199 --> 6223.099999999999
going there

6223.679 --> 6227.82
maybe Jesus himself had doubts for some

6226.199 --> 6230.54
reason

6227.82 --> 6230.54
I don't know

6233.82 --> 6238.679
contemplations

6235.86 --> 6240.719
but that's how I think it happened

6238.679 --> 6244.88
Elemental planes

6240.719 --> 6248.28
astral plane God in the astral plane

6244.88 --> 6250.46
connecting manifesting the Elohim the

6248.28 --> 6253.38
Elohim the Shapers they

6250.46 --> 6256.139
arrange the elemental planes into the

6253.38 --> 6258.4800000000005
material plane and then manifest the

6256.139 --> 6261.119
design for life

6258.48 --> 6264.0599999999995
basically another skill of ordering

6261.119 --> 6268.0199999999995
right more shaping more detail but all

6264.06 --> 6269.88
of the design was all in the mind

6268.02 --> 6272.820000000001
it was all

6269.88 --> 6275.46
information it was God

6272.82 --> 6277.0199999999995
the the not the Shapers the Shapers just

6275.46 --> 6281.4
shaped

6277.02 --> 6285.320000000001
they manifested the ideas of God

6281.4 --> 6289.86
they ordered things in order to

6285.32 --> 6291.599999999999
comport with the akashic library with

6289.86 --> 6293.16
the idea

6291.6 --> 6294.4800000000005
so that's how I see it

6293.16 --> 6296.46
[Music]

6294.48 --> 6298.259999999999
and that by the way has nothing directly

6296.46 --> 6300.54
to do with the ontological Primitive or

6298.26 --> 6303.119000000001
anything argument that's separate that's

6300.54 --> 6305.9
how I see it was originally formed and

6303.119 --> 6305.9
it's snowing again

6306.179 --> 6309.179
what

6310.739 --> 6313.82
alrighty then

6316.38 --> 6320.54
I'm really glad I don't have to go out

6325.52 --> 6330.320000000001
[Music]

6327.659 --> 6330.32
foreign

6332.93 --> 6336.009
[Music]

6345.44 --> 6349.5599999999995
God just created the universe doesn't

6347.699 --> 6351.659
intervene yeah

6349.56 --> 6355.139
evil nightmare well I don't know exactly

6351.659 --> 6357.239
what religion that is but

6355.139 --> 6360.4800000000005
that comes very clear well God does

6357.239 --> 6364.138999999999
intervene but only in spirit

6360.48 --> 6367.699
and through us through our ideas through

6364.139 --> 6367.6990000000005
what we choose

6368.159 --> 6374.58
so he doesn't just like from the outside

6372.659 --> 6376.799999999999
from in the aster realm just so

6374.58 --> 6378.96
certainly out of nowhere creates some

6376.8 --> 6381.360000000001
Avatar

6378.96 --> 6383.84
to start meddling

6381.36 --> 6383.839999999999
yeah

6384.3 --> 6389.34
I think that the only time he did that

6386.639 --> 6392.04
was in the beginning by creating the

6389.34 --> 6394.4400000000005
Shapers and everything all

6392.04 --> 6397.92
all the purpose all that was going to

6394.44 --> 6401.659
happen was all proceeding from there

6397.92 --> 6401.659
that's how I see an evil nightmare

6403.619 --> 6408.139
great show thanks Guns of Navarone I

6405.719 --> 6408.139
appreciate it

6408.42 --> 6413.96
yeah it has been a great show very happy

6411.42 --> 6413.96
about it

6423.719 --> 6427.38
it's called create a universally a

6425.699 --> 6429.96
product of the universe

6427.38 --> 6432.06
uh

6429.96 --> 6434.4800000000005
deism okay

6432.06 --> 6434.4800000000005
right

6443.34 --> 6448.92
yeah I'm not

6445.619 --> 6450.119
specifically stuck to a Heritage like

6448.92 --> 6454.26
that

6450.119 --> 6457.5599999999995
I mean I like I really respect Christ

6454.26 --> 6460.02
as a person but I respect him even more

6457.56 --> 6462.7390000000005
because I believe that the entire Bible

6460.02 --> 6464.820000000001
has basically been created to

6462.739 --> 6468.659
encapsulate him

6464.82 --> 6470.58
to actually pacify the true power of His

6468.659 --> 6473.339999999999
direct message

6470.58 --> 6476.46
to reinterpret it yeah coming full

6473.34 --> 6480.360000000001
circle here I think that

6476.46 --> 6483.96
Hermes or and arguably the devil in this

6480.36 --> 6486.239
specific scenario came through men

6483.96 --> 6489.06
to encapsulate through the Council of

6486.239 --> 6491.099999999999
nicia and everything encapsulate take

6489.06 --> 6494.280000000001
its power and authority

6491.1 --> 6497.3
and but yet conceal the actual power

6494.28 --> 6497.3
itself within

6497.94 --> 6504.659
yeah so listen to the the vicar

6501.719 --> 6507.4800000000005
listen to the the middleman what they

6504.659 --> 6509.04
say on how to interpret it yeah her

6507.48 --> 6511.32
manuetics

6509.04 --> 6515.06
Hermes Hermes telling you how to

6511.32 --> 6515.0599999999995
interpret a gatekeeper

6519.9 --> 6525.5599999999995
and that fascinates me

6522.06 --> 6529.02
that Jesus Christ and his words are so

6525.56 --> 6532.5
unbelievably powerful that an entire

6529.02 --> 6536.06
culture has spawned

6532.5 --> 6540.78
like a millennia ago

6536.06 --> 6545.280000000001
just to try to neutralize his influence

6540.78 --> 6546.96
okay Jesus Christ is that unbelievably

6545.28 --> 6552.179
powerful

6546.96 --> 6555.0
this entire thing all created just to

6552.179 --> 6557.4
try to neutralize the power of Christ

6555.0 --> 6559.619
yeah and that includes the Bible that

6557.4 --> 6561.36
includes the churches that includes all

6559.619 --> 6563.5199999999995
modern churches

6561.36 --> 6565.08
all of it

6563.52 --> 6568.9800000000005
it's all

6565.08 --> 6570.84
Hermes gatekeeping Christ and I I

6568.98 --> 6574.28
genuinely believe that

6570.84 --> 6574.28
and I can argue that

6575.76 --> 6582.719
and I have and I will in the future

6579.42 --> 6585.659
Jesus Is God I disagree

6582.719 --> 6589.94
that's not what he said

6585.659 --> 6589.94
and I take his words very serious

6592.08 --> 6596.48
more serious than the average Christian

6594.0 --> 6596.48
does

6598.199 --> 6602.5199999999995
but hey you're entitled to your opinion

6600.6 --> 6605.34
everybody

6602.52 --> 6607.7390000000005
has their dwellings and they need their

6605.34 --> 6609.78
time to figure out how they might be

6607.739 --> 6612.718999999999
mistaken

6609.78 --> 6615.36
so I'm not gonna be like oh how dare you

6612.719 --> 6617.82
I'm not gonna go devil persecuting just

6615.36 --> 6620.659
because I have this distinct

6617.82 --> 6620.659
View

6621.42 --> 6626.58
because I didn't

6623.82 --> 6629.94
yeah you can't expect everybody to just

6626.58 --> 6632.76
just convert no no that's not how it

6629.94 --> 6634.44
works you have to realize it I don't

6632.76 --> 6637.619000000001
convert people

6634.44 --> 6639.78
I try to give them the opportunity to

6637.619 --> 6642.0
realize

6639.78 --> 6644.46
that's what I like to do

6642.0 --> 6647.88
