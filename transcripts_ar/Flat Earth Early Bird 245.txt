76.1 --> 82.729
kind of the same as yesterday clouded I

78.77 --> 88.009
haven't seen this some single time so

82.729 --> 90.89
far but it's kind of moist not really

88.009 --> 99.709
cold but yeah cold enough for me to put

90.89 --> 103.19
on a sweater this is this is typical

99.709 --> 109.569
Dutch weather so today with me I have

103.19 --> 112.369
Tamara coffee tea and well a half

109.569 --> 117.17
Illuminati herself I was too hungry I

112.369 --> 119.679
ate it half of it I'm gonna proceed

117.17 --> 119.679
doing that

131.93 --> 134.89000000000001
hmm

137.63 --> 140.72
[Music]

151.85 --> 160.14
well that was almost like eating peanut

156.72 --> 164.72
butter my throat seems to be very dry

160.14 --> 167.25
oh well hmm so let's see who is in chat

164.72 --> 170.66
that one guy was first he was actually

167.25 --> 170.66
there before I said good morning

171.93 --> 178.67000000000002
Omer McCoy and Colin Turner with the

175.56 --> 183.96
super chat Daniel

178.67 --> 192.17999999999998
Amanda you stopped in traffic at my rest

183.96 --> 197.78
I had the plain truth steve-o deed odds

192.18 --> 197.78
and sods page yeah good to see you

200.15 --> 206.12
therefore I am well I wasn't there yet

211.05 --> 226.28
a flat-out faith so yesterday was kind

221.46 --> 234.09
of a quiet day as I experienced it I

226.28 --> 238.95
caught myself into I'd it's kind of

234.09 --> 243.6
weird but I'm watching Big Bang Theory

238.95 --> 247.01999999999998
again and now I'm watching it from a

243.6 --> 249.09
very much more educated point of view

247.02 --> 252.51000000000002
compared to the last time I watched it

249.09 --> 255.33
which was with my ex we kind of both

252.51 --> 257.52
enjoyed it because of the characters

255.33 --> 260.04
that I'm used look I'm used to those

257.52 --> 263.82
types of people okay

260.04 --> 268.38
those are nerds and they're kind of a

263.82 --> 273.9
little bit over exaggerated but those

268.38 --> 276.69
types aren't that far off to like yeah

273.9 --> 279.59999999999997
nerds out there that I've known it's

276.69 --> 282.15
just it's not exactly like that because

279.6 --> 286.35
now what is like no nerds gonna like be

282.15 --> 290.96
that excessive without being seriously

286.35 --> 290.96000000000004
deranged in a much more aggravated way

291.5 --> 297.15
but it was for it's funny so far I'm now

294.96 --> 301.77
at the fourth episode and it's really

297.15 --> 304.40999999999997
like yeah welcome to baller central you

301.77 --> 311.19
can't get more freaking baller than than

304.41 --> 314.1
these guys theoretical physics and it's

311.19 --> 317.84
fascinating how they act because it's

314.1 --> 323.25
very it's a very accurate portrayal

317.84 --> 325.59
these are the ballers and it's like they

323.25 --> 332.06
are extremely smart but they're also

325.59 --> 336.33
tricked very deeply very personally and

332.06 --> 338.61
people don't really know they only

336.33 --> 341.52
noticed the personal oddities in their

338.61 --> 343.67
behaviors and all that but it's like the

341.52 --> 346.58
whole baller religion is just hit

343.67 --> 349.01
there in plain sight it I'm pretty

346.58 --> 355.72999999999996
astounded now looking at it from another

349.01 --> 365.15
perspective again Brenda Brenda oh my

355.73 --> 374.48
god Rena your presentation this just wow

365.15 --> 377.29999999999995
I yeah well for your doing I guess it

374.48 --> 379.12
went well by your standards oh yeah it

377.3 --> 382.97
went smooth

379.12 --> 385.49
but yeah by the standards of the rest of

382.97 --> 388.09000000000003
the world I think they're not gonna see

385.49 --> 388.09000000000003
it the same way

392.669 --> 396.50899999999996
yeah and besides all that [ __ ] didn't

395.28 --> 400.10999999999996
have anything to do with Flat Earth

396.509 --> 410.969
really basically started just wanking on

400.11 --> 413.699
and just draw everything into it oh yeah

410.969 --> 416.06
Colin Turner yeah I do apply Sarka sorry

413.699 --> 416.06
it's

424.4 --> 431.5
look what I did when I do sarcasm I

427.81 --> 434.75
start with sarcasm but I never then

431.5 --> 437.6
subtract like a coward and basically

434.75 --> 439.699
stick it to pure sarcasm to keep people

437.6 --> 442.87
in uncertainty no then I follow up by

439.699 --> 446.96000000000004
something that is blatantly in-your-face

442.87 --> 449.69
unmistakeably interpretable so that's

446.96 --> 452.98999999999995
how I deal with sarcasm I start out with

449.69 --> 455.15
sarcasm and then I just it's like an

452.99 --> 461.03000000000003
elastic and then I slap it in their face

455.15 --> 463.63
that's what I do I hope that's that's

461.03 --> 463.63
kind of obvious

470.81 --> 477.629
[Music]

473.119 --> 480.379
yep yeah Brenda sure yeah it's all about

477.629 --> 483.10900000000004
facts all these these facts

480.379 --> 487.79900000000004
unfortunately yeah your you have a giant

483.109 --> 489.50899999999996
scoop of Legos sort of like facts but

487.799 --> 494.039
you really don't know how to build

489.509 --> 497.939
anything sensible with it so yeah your

494.039 --> 502.37899999999996
facts it's really nice but what you make

497.939 --> 506.959
of it is pure [ __ ] it's worse to tear

502.379 --> 511.66900000000004
statism approach superficial diluted

506.959 --> 516.269
worst approach philosophical [ __ ]

511.669 --> 519.86
that's what I kind of tend to describe

516.269 --> 519.86
what you put out Rena

523.86 --> 531.96
so facts is nice but it's what you do

528.42 --> 534.9
with them and what you imagine the

531.96 --> 537.39
connections of you lay and the weight

534.9 --> 539.43
you put on that it's a highly feeble

537.39 --> 542.88
structure that you've built highly

539.43 --> 546.5699999999999
feeble and yeah youth you can see it you

542.88 --> 551.45
can see it working because your level of

546.57 --> 554.82
critical thought has just been so so

551.45 --> 566.33
derail I don't know damaged I don't know

554.82 --> 566.33
how it happened but you just do this

568.01 --> 572.56
I'm not sugarcoating anything white bear

575.13 --> 578.419
[Music]

580.99 --> 588.64
well Daniel because Brenda deserves it

584.06 --> 593.1099999999999
Brenda is one of the worst misbehaving

588.64 --> 598.22
delusional people on the internet and

593.11 --> 604.64
she's totally zealously convinced of her

598.22 --> 608.5600000000001
own oh yeah she has certainty about her

604.64 --> 612.74
truth and that is religious zealotry

608.56 --> 615.04
more than anyone else and she'll just go

612.74 --> 615.04
wherever

623.72 --> 649.1890000000001
Oh God hello music man and boom so

643.339 --> 652.9100000000001
anyway that happened yeah I thought it

649.189 --> 655.279
was pretty I think ranty held up pretty

652.91 --> 657.949
strong basically not bursting out in

655.279 --> 662.029
laughter because you could see it on his

657.949 --> 667.819
face a lot of the time because you were

662.029 --> 670.129
making just such a display like saying

667.819 --> 673.55
you were making an ass of yourself

670.129 --> 677.98
Renda that's just not sufficient enough

673.55 --> 677.9799999999999
to describe what you did right there

678.79 --> 682.879
it's like there's no confusion about it

681.379 --> 684.6800000000001
this time you know it's not because

682.879 --> 686.99
other people are interrupting or

684.68 --> 691.4799999999999
disagree and then you move on to another

686.99 --> 694.759
no you put it all out straight on and

691.48 --> 696.8290000000001
you don't even realize what you did what

694.759 --> 700.399
you got in there and you're so convinced

696.829 --> 703.0889999999999
of this you're insane

700.399 --> 703.089
Randa

706.83 --> 721.26
there's no locusts there it's just sorry

709.589 --> 725.73
I just feel you have this

721.26 --> 730.38
conceptualization you think reality is

725.73 --> 731.8100000000001
what you make of it that's the feeling I

730.38 --> 736.529
get with Brenda

731.81 --> 739.649
it's Luciferian it's just that's it and

736.529 --> 744.06
she supports all the flip-flop inside

739.649 --> 747.66
world all of that so yeah whether she

744.06 --> 751.3499999999999
realizes it or not whether she would

747.66 --> 759.329
agree to it that explanation or not I

751.35 --> 761.76
think that's the case it's just that you

759.329 --> 771.6899999999999
know you know it by there by its fruits

761.76 --> 775.399
you him so Paige I disagree look it's

771.69 --> 777.45
not about her Tran her his whatever

775.399 --> 779.18
transsexuality okay has nothing to do

777.45 --> 784.0500000000001
with it

779.18 --> 787.5
look you could say that that thing was

784.05 --> 791.1899999999999
like it's a risk sign if somebody's

787.5 --> 792.959
gonna do that they could be seriously

791.19 --> 796.7090000000001
deranged but it doesn't need to be like

792.959 --> 801.54
that because I know two transsexuals it

796.709 --> 806.0699999999999
face to face that have some issues but

801.54 --> 809.37
they're aware and decent people they are

806.07 --> 811.7090000000001
they are in control of themselves and

809.37 --> 813.3
they are managing themselves and trying

811.709 --> 819.7199999999999
to learn how to deal with themselves

813.3 --> 824.04
very responsible people and they are

819.72 --> 826.44
transsexual so you don't need to it's

824.04 --> 831.93
like not like if you do that you will

826.44 --> 836.4300000000001
guaranteed turn insane but it is for

831.93 --> 840.2399999999999
somebody to be like go yeah let that be

836.43 --> 843.5699999999999
done to them by their own volition

840.24 --> 847.88
like at an adult age even that is just a

843.57 --> 851.6700000000001
sign that that's a logos conflict

847.88 --> 855.649
no matter your view onto it and whatever

851.67 --> 858.3
view you hold that will allow that will

855.649 --> 861.0
whether you like it or not be braking

858.3 --> 864.27
with logos and that just has a result

861.0 --> 868.95
that has a risk and that can set

864.27 --> 872.209
somebody on a path away from the path of

868.95 --> 876.75
Christ and then turn them into monsters

872.209 --> 879.18
but yeah how far that monstrosity will

876.75 --> 881.04
manifest depends on the individual and

879.18 --> 885.42
there are their natural appetites that

881.04 --> 887.64
will arise so it's never the same with

885.42 --> 891.12
any individual so you can't basically

887.64 --> 893.22
just anchor the entire judgment if you

891.12 --> 896.16
want to do it critically thinking wise

893.22 --> 897.6600000000001
not just your opinion or your feelings

896.16 --> 901.17
but if you want to be critically

897.66 --> 904.709
thinking you can't just say okay that

901.17 --> 908.399
person is a transsexual that's pretty

904.709 --> 913.04
much like that makes them dangerous or

908.399 --> 916.92
insane oh no no that's that's incorrect

913.04 --> 919.26
but it is kind of like a flag where you

916.92 --> 922.8199999999999
should be paying more attention for

919.26 --> 922.8199999999999
those signs that is all

923.94 --> 929.8100000000001
[Music]

925.93 --> 932.569
it's just like comparing it for example

929.81 --> 934.329
and I'd hope not to insult anybody with

932.569 --> 938.029
this don't take it

934.329 --> 941.1389999999999
harshly but people for example that use

938.029 --> 945.62
mushrooms and LSD and DMT and all that

941.139 --> 949.16
these people yeah a lot of them become

945.62 --> 951.319
extremely wise from it but some that

949.16 --> 957.379
kind of like get more addicted to the

951.319 --> 965.269
process they can become somewhat they

957.379 --> 970.4590000000001
can I say contract weird tweets for

965.269 --> 972.7090000000001
example or just issues or all these guys

970.459 --> 973.55
but that doesn't mean that they are all

972.709 --> 977.06
crazy

973.55 --> 981.1099999999999
it just means again it's like oh did you

977.06 --> 983.149
do that then a flag like okay you need

981.11 --> 986.24
to pee and pay more attention for those

983.149 --> 989.389
types of things like is this person in

986.24 --> 991.069
control does he still have those

989.389 --> 993.399
faculties he dealing with this

991.069 --> 996.259
responsibly and realistically all these

993.399 --> 999.47
designs doesn't mean you need to just oh

996.259 --> 1002.7090000000001
this guy uses mushrooms that means he's

999.47 --> 1006.759
gonna be a weirdo or happy or no that's

1002.709 --> 1010.319
stupid it's over generalization but it

1006.759 --> 1015.54
should bring it's just a flag a flag

1010.319 --> 1015.54
with science to pay attention for it

1023.429 --> 1029.939
well this is not all about about Brenda

1026.62 --> 1032.77
Daniel this is now more in general look

1029.939 --> 1036.039
this is not I'm not talking about just

1032.77 --> 1037.66
because Brenda is a transsexual doesn't

1036.039 --> 1041.41
mean that everything I just said all

1037.66 --> 1043.6000000000001
applies to specifically only to Brenda I

1041.41 --> 1053.559
was referring to other people I know

1043.6 --> 1055.03
like that so all right and a as far as

1053.559 --> 1059.2
Brenda I don't think I really

1055.03 --> 1061.289
psychoanalyze her I just described what

1059.2 --> 1064.03
I saw I specifically didn't

1061.289 --> 1066.1299999999999
psychoanalyze her I don't even want to

1064.03 --> 1069.94
do that she probably already has a

1066.13 --> 1072.5100000000002
psychoanalysis I'm pretty sure she knows

1069.94 --> 1078.0900000000001
exactly what she's supposed to be having

1072.51 --> 1078.09
so right

1082.53 --> 1088.96
Oh God yeah I heard it boom

1085.83 --> 1088.96
[Music]

1095.02 --> 1112.6399999999999
yeah all right so anyway was there was

1109.22 --> 1115.82
oh yeah Jaron yeah he's pretty much

1112.64 --> 1118.789
dropped the globe Buster's I think and

1115.82 --> 1120.74
he's now doing a show and the one of the

1118.789 --> 1127.539
I never forget I always forget his name

1120.74 --> 1133.49
D was a Italian guy I think Spanish guy

1127.539 --> 1136.039
anyway he or is it Argentina the guy

1133.49 --> 1138.08
with the heavy accent they have a

1136.039 --> 1140.679
Mediterranean accent as far as I can

1138.08 --> 1143.33
identify that is always on ghost bus

1140.679 --> 1145.6100000000001
ghostbusters on globe Buster's went on

1143.33 --> 1147.6689999999999
with him I think that like Bob's

1145.61 --> 1152.289
basically retracted or something and

1147.669 --> 1155.0
they're now just doing their thing

1152.289 --> 1156.52
without Bob I guess and yeah it was

1155.0 --> 1161.24
pretty interesting

1156.52 --> 1164.6299999999999
it was it was a good watch so yeah I

1161.24 --> 1167.51
hope to see Jaron basically continue

1164.63 --> 1169.6100000000001
with that who knows maybe I'll maybe

1167.51 --> 1171.649
he'll have me on some time talk about

1169.61 --> 1174.9799999999998
stuff I don't know that would be kind of

1171.649 --> 1176.09
cool I think I didn't know if he'd feel

1174.98 --> 1181.19
comfortable with that

1176.09 --> 1185.99
oh really Bob will be back with glow

1181.19 --> 1190.8990000000001
Buster's okay if you say so Karen B but

1185.99 --> 1190.8990000000001
I haven't seen Bob in a while so

1191.92 --> 1196.23
yeah I remember that boom

1205.63 --> 1211.5800000000002
anyway that was good no Benjamin yet

1209.51 --> 1215.57
went all through one another I've been

1211.58 --> 1218.96
listening yeah I watched I mean The Big

1215.57 --> 1224.6589999999999
Bang Theory little and been also been

1218.96 --> 1227.24
gaming a little bit more and I've

1224.659 --> 1230.3300000000002
noticed that yeah it's it's a game it's

1227.24 --> 1232.039
a game that's like kind of slightly

1230.33 --> 1238.07
suspicious to a lot of people

1232.039 --> 1241.399
yeah it's called Diablo 3 it's a game I

1238.07 --> 1245.0
it's I had it for a long time I used to

1241.399 --> 1250.6999999999998
play with my ex even and it is kind of

1245.0 --> 1253.73
darkish very gothic and but it's a very

1250.7 --> 1255.6490000000001
well crafted game and recently what's

1253.73 --> 1257.679
kind of been pulling me back and they

1255.649 --> 1261.08
really got it

1257.679 --> 1262.8500000000001
what however you approach that is the

1261.08 --> 1265.039
same thing that pulls me back into the

1262.85 --> 1270.4599999999998
baldur's gate games and that is the

1265.039 --> 1276.83
music and they really put on a literal

1270.46 --> 1279.95
classical orchestral palette of music in

1276.83 --> 1283.8799999999999
there that is just that's so impressive

1279.95 --> 1285.52
to me and just yeah the game just by its

1283.88 --> 1288.919
own volition it's okay

1285.52 --> 1291.679
but that music is just such a heavy it's

1288.919 --> 1295.88
heavy music magic it's very like

1291.679 --> 1298.97
thrilling and spooky and scary and

1295.88 --> 1301.7
horror also but all classical

1298.97 --> 1306.919
instrumental all of it and with singing

1301.7 --> 1311.1200000000001
core and man and lady it's really heavy

1306.919 --> 1314.72
musical [ __ ] and I'm like oh my god that

1311.12 --> 1316.9089999999999
is really beautiful it's it's almost

1314.72 --> 1319.22
creepy it is there are some real

1316.909 --> 1323.5390000000002
darkness I think also hidden there

1319.22 --> 1331.14
somewhere with some of these people but

1323.539 --> 1337.23
it's like a really heavy opera of ghosts

1331.14 --> 1338.8200000000002
like ghost Horror Show music that's what

1337.23 --> 1340.44
it's like to me and it's yeah it's kind

1338.82 --> 1342.24
of fascinating to me but I have to be

1340.44 --> 1344.1000000000001
careful not to keep that music on

1342.24 --> 1347.429
looping and looping in my mind because

1344.1 --> 1350.37
that really does kind of draw me out out

1347.429 --> 1352.5
of the light and should do that too much

1350.37 --> 1354.4499999999998
so I have to be careful against always

1352.5 --> 1356.549
this game if you keep on it's a weird

1354.45 --> 1358.98
game it's awesome but if you keep on

1356.549 --> 1359.37
stuck to it it starts to [ __ ] with your

1358.98 --> 1362.63
mind

1359.37 --> 1366.08
it's really weird probably on purpose

1362.63 --> 1369.24
it's also part why it is designed so

1366.08 --> 1373.62
incredibly well like this game is not

1369.24 --> 1376.26
gonna like the amount of graphics that I

1373.62 --> 1380.2199999999998
get to see on this is just so insane

1376.26 --> 1382.559
sometimes like things exploding and [ __ ]

1380.22 --> 1386.659
and like what I get the scene is just

1382.559 --> 1389.9089999999999
insanely flashy and just so much stuff

1386.659 --> 1391.8500000000001
I've never seen a game show anything

1389.909 --> 1394.47
like that ever before

1391.85 --> 1397.529
without having some kind of slowdown

1394.47 --> 1399.96
it's pretty incredible anyway but that's

1397.529 --> 1403.409
technical so I've been playing that

1399.96 --> 1407.46
again and I do enjoy it but it's mostly

1403.409 --> 1409.7990000000002
the music that keeps pulling me back and

1407.46 --> 1414.99
they put some real serious classical

1409.799 --> 1417.21
music there it is you can just if you

1414.99 --> 1420.059
don't want to play that game all that

1417.21 --> 1424.23
[ __ ] does cost it's pretty expensive

1420.059 --> 1427.74
game you can just look up the musical

1424.23 --> 1429.779
track the sorry the music track on the

1427.74 --> 1433.95
YouTube and I did and I downloaded it

1429.779 --> 1437.85
and just just for study because they put

1433.95 --> 1442.07
all the tricks in the book for music

1437.85 --> 1446.25
effects it's like a giant palette of

1442.07 --> 1448.23
theatrical effects made with music to

1446.25 --> 1450.63
create atmosphere and that is just it's

1448.23 --> 1452.84
fascinating just all the different

1450.63 --> 1455.8400000000001
elements that are in there it's so wide

1452.84 --> 1455.84
so

1457.21 --> 1471.58
what Lords laughable their agents Arwen

1466.27 --> 1471.58
DW you got real supporters to what

1478.309 --> 1485.2
yeah all right I guess I'm not the only

1482.179 --> 1490.1190000000001
person that plays these types of games

1485.2 --> 1493.3400000000001
yeah all right

1490.119 --> 1495.1689999999999
yeah Diablo 2 I used to play that a lot

1493.34 --> 1498.9189999999999
it's a it's a different type of game

1495.169 --> 1500.5700000000002
though it's the game itself I thought it

1498.919 --> 1502.3400000000001
was extremely satisfying these

1500.57 --> 1505.549
structures and that kept me playing it

1502.34 --> 1507.379
for extremely long back in the day but I

1505.549 --> 1509.179
yeah I've played it through so many

1507.379 --> 1512.6589999999999
times there's nothing real they don't

1509.179 --> 1514.8790000000001
update it really and this game is like

1512.659 --> 1519.919
an online forced game but they do really

1514.879 --> 1522.9499999999998
update it and it's it really is like

1519.919 --> 1526.789
another level of Diablo to it once you

1522.95 --> 1532.099
really get into it but you have to go

1526.789 --> 1533.899
there I guess but the game Diablo 2 is

1532.099 --> 1535.849
really a game you can technically just

1533.899 --> 1538.9089999999999
play on for hours and hours and hours

1535.849 --> 1542.499
Diablo 3 that's very unhealthy to do

1538.909 --> 1545.1190000000001
because of the influence because of the

1542.499 --> 1548.83
effectiveness of the applied influence

1545.119 --> 1548.83
that's just a difference

1555.679 --> 1565.13
gamer's yep anyway

1559.17 --> 1570.1200000000001
I see it basically as a bad habit now

1565.13 --> 1571.89
playing these games and I really I I had

1570.12 --> 1574.6499999999999
kind of a reason why I started doing

1571.89 --> 1577.679
this again because one thing that does

1574.65 --> 1579.96
happen because I get like pound 2 the

1577.679 --> 1583.8600000000001
game focused on it for pretty long times

1579.96 --> 1587.73
usually it also helps my mind getting

1583.86 --> 1592.7299999999998
off smoking cannabis so I'm actually

1587.73 --> 1595.919
using it as a money saver to myself so

1592.73 --> 1600.39
that I guess makes it look a little bit

1595.919 --> 1604.19
less like oh I'm being seduced again I'm

1600.39 --> 1608.22
kind of like trying to prevent just

1604.19 --> 1610.26
smoking smoking smoking and having

1608.22 --> 1612.809
something to do yeah and this is like

1610.26 --> 1614.52
yeah why don't you get a job or why

1612.809 --> 1616.799
don't you get a job yeah thanks all the

1614.52 --> 1619.1689999999999
trolls for constantly telling me this

1616.799 --> 1624.179
everywhere I go that's really nice yeah

1619.169 --> 1627.48
and trust me I've been thinking about it

1624.179 --> 1630.75
but I'd rather figure out how to

1627.48 --> 1632.85
basically make a job for myself and I

1630.75 --> 1636.15
really do consider what I do here as a

1632.85 --> 1640.7099999999998
long-term career investment even though

1636.15 --> 1643.8600000000001
it seems barely feasible on the

1640.71 --> 1646.41
short-term perspective but because I'm

1643.86 --> 1649.559
investing in a long term project and I'm

1646.41 --> 1655.41
really having a lot of intellectual grip

1649.559 --> 1659.94
on the situation that kind of will pull

1655.41 --> 1663.8700000000001
me through all this basically and it is

1659.94 --> 1665.76
what I guess hopefully I think I think

1663.87 --> 1669.02
it's one of the things that it makes

1665.76 --> 1669.02
people come back I guess

1670.37 --> 1674.9289999999999
at Remagen oh I give up the weed just

1674.51 --> 1682.64
money

1674.929 --> 1686.75
well no not just money actually I can

1682.64 --> 1689.65
tell you there is a chance and I've have

1686.75 --> 1695.179
been through this before I'll explain

1689.65 --> 1697.76
when I get a lot of money or plenty when

1695.179 --> 1701.8400000000001
I'm doing great I don't have so much

1697.76 --> 1705.309
issues with smoking cannabis because of

1701.84 --> 1708.1689999999999
the amount it is almost like scarcity

1705.309 --> 1710.62
kind of makes cannabis more appealing to

1708.169 --> 1713.51
me it's very weird how that works

1710.62 --> 1718.059
because I've had a period where I

1713.51 --> 1718.059
haven't smoked any cannabis for five

1718.159 --> 1724.64
perfect years without exception five

1720.649 --> 1728.57
years non-stop while I had a giant bag

1724.64 --> 1733.8090000000002
of it with like 150 grams and I just

1728.57 --> 1733.809
kept it I didn't touch it and it worked

1735.309 --> 1741.73
for some reason it's a part of the

1738.529 --> 1744.14
scarcity of money and cannabis kind of

1741.73 --> 1746.99
makes it more appealing to me naturally

1744.14 --> 1749.8700000000001
and that is really annoying actually

1746.99 --> 1751.97
because it makes it typically that I go

1749.87 --> 1755.6
into addiction spiral when I'm not doing

1751.97 --> 1758.72
financially all that great so that's

1755.6 --> 1761.09
it's a weird thing that that has become

1758.72 --> 1765.049
part of me in that sense but that's how

1761.09 --> 1766.75
I figured out that it's working I'm just

1765.049 --> 1769.34
being open about it because I really

1766.75 --> 1773.75
want to get this under control on the

1769.34 --> 1779.299
d'lai I believe that I can using actual

1773.75 --> 1784.19
critical thought and really unraveling

1779.299 --> 1787.76
the demons inside me with truth with

1784.19 --> 1791.539
exposure with humbleness about myself

1787.76 --> 1794.09
and that's also what I'm doing and at

1791.539 --> 1796.87
that I hope to be basically an open

1794.09 --> 1796.87
study case

1797.75 --> 1803.97
I'm basically putting myself up for

1800.789 --> 1807.72
expect public experimentation by myself

1803.97 --> 1811.74
it's a social public experiment what I'm

1807.72 --> 1814.94
doing I was very hesitant at first to

1811.74 --> 1818.76
really start putting out my more inner

1814.94 --> 1822.75
workings like you can't you can barely

1818.76 --> 1826.769
imagine now how tough the threshold was

1822.75 --> 1829.26
to start admitting that I had these

1826.769 --> 1832.47
vision experiences for example I was

1829.26 --> 1837.84
absolutely mortified at first to share

1832.47 --> 1840.8990000000001
this because that just every time I

1837.84 --> 1843.029
thought about it and just tried to

1840.899 --> 1847.08
imagine like what it would be like to

1843.029 --> 1849.36
tell somebody new then my natural

1847.08 --> 1855.24
response would be oh my god that

1849.36 --> 1857.4189999999999
person's like is has-been is like has

1855.24 --> 1859.98
been like mentally or spiritually

1857.419 --> 1862.3500000000001
compromised that would be my personal

1859.98 --> 1864.539
natural response because of my

1862.35 --> 1866.639
sensitivity I would be really scared

1864.539 --> 1869.519
like oh you seriously had a very big

1866.639 --> 1873.6589999999999
hallucination in which you say you

1869.519 --> 1877.049
transcend the time well then either

1873.659 --> 1880.8890000000001
you're like a liar that's believing his

1877.049 --> 1885.36
own lies or you've went for through some

1880.889 --> 1889.9399999999998
very crazy [ __ ] and that makes it even

1885.36 --> 1893.85
more scary that would be my personal

1889.94 --> 1896.669
response to that on the first hand just

1893.85 --> 1898.83
the first time you heard it so that was

1896.669 --> 1902.519
very scary for me to put that out but I

1898.83 --> 1906.389
have I have I did that sweating and all

1902.519 --> 1908.3990000000001
really anxious afterward but I started

1906.389 --> 1911.58
to do that and people were kind of like

1908.399 --> 1913.559
oh yeah why not just tell me that I was

1911.58 --> 1916.23
surprised that people weren't freaking

1913.559 --> 1918.059
out as much of that like really like so

1916.23 --> 1921.3600000000001
for the trolls but the trolls just

1918.059 --> 1923.47
freaked out by default so it doesn't

1921.36 --> 1925.7299999999998
really matter

1923.47 --> 1930.679
it's weird how it works anyway by the

1925.73 --> 1934.279
way Thank You Jeremiah for the one pound

1930.679 --> 1941.419
99 super chat donation some of my weed

1934.279 --> 1942.08
money low thanks yeah no but I'm not a

1941.419 --> 1947.1190000000001
how to weed

1942.08 --> 1948.98
don't worry but I don't like how much

1947.119 --> 1951.58
money it is costing me compared to

1948.98 --> 1951.58
everything else

1957.44 --> 1963.56
at this point it is kind of preventing

1960.29 --> 1968.81
me from really saving up although I am

1963.56 --> 1971.26
still able to basically work my debt my

1968.81 --> 1976.01
how do you call it

1971.26 --> 1979.52
work away the red as it were gradually

1976.01 --> 1984.53
so it's not getting it's not making it

1979.52 --> 1987.11
worse but still yeah I just imagine what

1984.53 --> 1990.53
if I didn't do it at all what it would

1987.11 --> 1993.2299999999998
be like what else would I do in instead

1990.53 --> 1997.46
I will probably cost less money I think

1993.23 --> 1998.99
and then how much how fast would I get

1997.46 --> 2001.0900000000001
out of the red would I be able to save

1998.99 --> 2004.84
up so yeah that's constantly in my mind

2001.09 --> 2007.81
like I really do just wish to climb out

2004.84 --> 2009.49
of this financial pit that it seems to

2007.81 --> 2012.1
be for me at the time and one of the

2009.49 --> 2015.36
ways to achieve that for me without

2012.1 --> 2019.2099999999998
having to quit is to basically have a a

2015.36 --> 2021.79
new place to live with the garden and

2019.21 --> 2026.56
then I just get my own plants and then

2021.79 --> 2028.51
after a while I don't really mmm alright

2026.56 --> 2030.22
just need to buy a lot less it'll save

2028.51 --> 2031.47
me so much money will that give me

2030.22 --> 2034.3500000000001
something to do

2031.47 --> 2036.76
extra it'll be great

2034.35 --> 2038.5
but yeah as long as I'm living right

2036.76 --> 2042.76
where I'm living right now it's that

2038.5 --> 2047.11
just not gonna work out yeah I know

2042.76 --> 2050.169
Jonathan Daughtery but unfortunately

2047.11 --> 2055.48
that pit is usually dug by themselves

2050.169 --> 2059.7599999999998
and in my case that's kind of yeah

2055.48 --> 2059.76
that's practically also the case

2067.3 --> 2073.21
we have from a very direct standpoint I

2070.32 --> 2075.429
could even conceptualize it and this is

2073.21 --> 2077.23
just very conceptual it's not like I'm

2075.429 --> 2079.4500000000003
really literally gonna try this right

2077.23 --> 2081.1
out but technically if I would quit

2079.45 --> 2084.1
again it really managed to do that and

2081.1 --> 2085.7799999999997
hopefully also quit smoking tobacco's

2084.1 --> 2087.52
entirely you just get that out of my

2085.78 --> 2090.52
system that will be healthier for me in

2087.52 --> 2096.61
the long run I would probably be able to

2090.52 --> 2101.83
at some point just be able to expand

2096.61 --> 2105.3700000000003
whatever I do and then get that

2101.83 --> 2107.62
availability get financially in range of

2105.37 --> 2110.14
having that new home with a garden to do

2107.62 --> 2112.5099999999998
that so and then I could choose like oh

2110.14 --> 2115.69
yeah I can do it again and then I'm at

2112.51 --> 2118.26
least doing it from within a viable

2115.69 --> 2118.26
setup

2123.6 --> 2130.14
but at this point I don't feel confident

2126.6 --> 2135.06
for yet to be able to manage to do that

2130.14 --> 2135.75
really yeah by the way I unblocked

2135.06 --> 2140.04
Lottie

2135.75 --> 2143.1
so if you see Lottie don't block him

2140.04 --> 2146.61
anymore for now unless he starts

2143.1 --> 2152.5499999999997
misbehaving again because yeah I would

2146.61 --> 2155.76
lotty surprised me he said so a troll

2152.55 --> 2158.1600000000003
remark that I thought was kind of cool

2155.76 --> 2161.7000000000003
and it was actually so cool

2158.16 --> 2164.7599999999998
and he hit me at the right moment that I

2161.7 --> 2168.24
just I had to reward him for that he was

2164.76 --> 2174.7200000000003
basically saying in chat our winter is

2168.24 --> 2177.0299999999997
coming and I just thought that is that

2174.72 --> 2180.48
is just so cool yeah you deserve to be

2177.03 --> 2183.36
unblocked for that I just yeah I did got

2180.48 --> 2185.88
a reward creativity I really like that

2183.36 --> 2188.67
remark I thought it was awesome so yeah

2185.88 --> 2197.4900000000002
I don't know if he's even gonna be here

2188.67 --> 2200.69
but and yeah some of you may have

2197.49 --> 2205.29
noticed and Daniel's also back because

2200.69 --> 2211.82
it basically gave him a week timeout you

2205.29 --> 2211.82
could say hey II mind-warped

2222.96 --> 2228.359
jam pics yeah I'm not gonna try that

2227.46 --> 2233.13
thank you

2228.359 --> 2235.619
new new new no I if I'm gonna stop

2233.13 --> 2239.2200000000003
smoking it has to be psychologically

2235.619 --> 2241.4100000000003
viable for me it really I have to have a

2239.22 --> 2243.4199999999996
program basically it doesn't mean the

2241.41 --> 2247.2889999999998
Google program step by step

2243.42 --> 2250.4700000000003
currently no I need things to occupy

2247.289 --> 2254.309
myself with and replace it with and be

2250.47 --> 2257.549
able to get the issues properly out of

2254.309 --> 2260.539
the way and at the same time guide the

2257.549 --> 2263.339
new energies that will come unleashed

2260.539 --> 2266.5490000000004
because of the chemical burdens that are

2263.339 --> 2268.47
lifted from me and then it'll work it

2266.549 --> 2270.98
worked the last time it worked

2268.47 --> 2270.98
excellent

2275.55 --> 2283.32
like the last time I quit smoking it was

2280.07 --> 2286.7400000000002
yeah it was right before I basically

2283.32 --> 2289.6200000000003
decided yeah no it was right after I

2286.74 --> 2292.08
decided I'm gonna go do goldsmithing and

2289.62 --> 2294.81
if I want to do it right I gotta stop

2292.08 --> 2296.7599999999998
smoking I gotta be completely clear and

2294.81 --> 2300.99
it doesn't matter if I'm gonna be

2296.76 --> 2304.5
agitated a lot compared to usual because

2300.99 --> 2309.99
I gotta focus and and that worked out

2304.5 --> 2311.12
and worked out great and I didn't wanna

2309.99 --> 2314.0099999999998
smoke it

2311.12 --> 2316.95
smoking was to say I was under more

2314.01 --> 2320.34
strain in the whole process much more

2316.95 --> 2324.24
and if I would have smoked like in

2320.34 --> 2328.88
between then that would have had like a

2324.24 --> 2332.1299999999997
severe spiritual lash out it would

2328.88 --> 2333.9
basically try to unravel that constant

2332.13 --> 2338.82
tension that I was but on purpose trying

2333.9 --> 2343.05
to uphold during the whole process to

2338.82 --> 2344.9700000000003
basically push me into focus and smoking

2343.05 --> 2348.54
would have completely unraveled that so

2344.97 --> 2353.8799999999997
I couldn't I couldn't smell cannabis it

2348.54 --> 2356.79
was very dangerous in that time but then

2353.88 --> 2360.09
it basically finished I finished I

2356.79 --> 2362.13
became a goldsmith I kept on I kept

2360.09 --> 2364.7400000000002
making projects I didn't need freaking

2362.13 --> 2367.4700000000003
cannabis I had so much ideas and

2364.74 --> 2373.5
inspiration and research and Alex Jones

2367.47 --> 2376.7999999999997
came in that picture big time and then I

2373.5 --> 2379.11
met my ex and was pretty much clean even

2376.8 --> 2383.01
with smoking no more nothing smoked

2379.11 --> 2388.5
nothing and then after a while my ex

2383.01 --> 2391.26
kind of like let me get back I basically

2388.5 --> 2394.08
found the old bag of cannabis oh wait

2391.26 --> 2398.7000000000003
it's in this drawer and I thought hmm

2394.08 --> 2401.16
let's try it out just like my ex was

2398.7 --> 2404.18
away with her girlfriends for the

2401.16 --> 2407.8799999999997
weekend so I thought okay I'm just gonna

2404.18 --> 2410.22
take a bud and put it like I used to be

2407.88 --> 2412.08
fooling around with incense a lot and I

2410.22 --> 2415.0499999999997
instead just okay instead of instance

2412.08 --> 2417.27
I'm gonna put just a piece of cannabis

2415.05 --> 2419.76
on one of those glowing

2417.27 --> 2421.74
yeah those hot charcoals on which you

2419.76 --> 2426.0
can burn incense and then inhale it

2421.74 --> 2429.12
directly and it was a really amazing

2426.0 --> 2431.82
experience because I hadn't smoked for

2429.12 --> 2434.72
so long and I basically started it up

2431.82 --> 2438.96
like a ritual like that and it was

2434.72 --> 2442.1099999999997
really good because I did it once every

2438.96 --> 2446.03
two weeks at first that was really good

2442.11 --> 2452.4
to me very therapeutic oh and just pure

2446.03 --> 2454.11
but then after a while I became so proud

2452.4 --> 2457.62
of the balance that I achieved that I

2454.11 --> 2459.42
tried to share it with my ex who wasn't

2457.62 --> 2461.7
it was kind of glad about it she

2459.42 --> 2468.0
actually did notice my a lot of stress

2461.7 --> 2471.2999999999997
was relieved and then I kind of slipped

2468.0 --> 2475.68
back into accepting that it's just an

2471.3 --> 2477.57
open habit and that's when I really got

2475.68 --> 2481.77
back into getting addicted to it and

2477.57 --> 2484.11
then my ex the issues with my ex that

2481.77 --> 2486.03
were dormant kind of came up and then

2484.11 --> 2490.17
unfortunately I started immediately

2486.03 --> 2491.8500000000004
using cannabis to escape from the

2490.17 --> 2496.4
situation emotionally and that's when

2491.85 --> 2496.4
yeah I was back in the old place again

2496.76 --> 2503.13
so it's pretty weird how cannabis can

2500.91 --> 2505.73
influence you it's so dependent on the

2503.13 --> 2511.85
circumstances what it really does to you

2505.73 --> 2511.85
so I hope you find this interesting

2513.71 --> 2519.52
my testimony about the different types

2516.89 --> 2523.5499999999997
of influences cannabis can have during

2519.52 --> 2527.329
several types of situations you can

2523.55 --> 2530.17
matter in how you wield yourself in how

2527.329 --> 2538.28
you manage your tensions and everything

2530.17 --> 2540.38
it yeah it matters a lot and I guess for

2538.28 --> 2544.0690000000004
some other people it kind of works the

2540.38 --> 2547.099
same with alcohol like sometimes alcohol

2544.069 --> 2550.3089999999997
two people can be a great social

2547.099 --> 2553.13
catalyst really loosen you up and get

2550.309 --> 2555.23
you in that socializing zone in the open

2553.13 --> 2559.13
trust in contact and seeing the signs

2555.23 --> 2561.41
all that really good but hey if let's

2559.13 --> 2572.329
just imagine that same person would be

2561.41 --> 2574.52
in like pretty heavy no weights like

2572.329 --> 2577.69
that person would be in a vacuum like

2574.52 --> 2580.309
they just got fired or something and

2577.69 --> 2583.13
they don't have a lot to do and if you

2580.309 --> 2586.52
go drinking then then certainly that

2583.13 --> 2588.7400000000002
normal catalyzer for the energies so

2586.52 --> 2591.14
they can't manifest because you don't

2588.74 --> 2593.6299999999997
have something to do with it and then

2591.14 --> 2596.45
suddenly the alcohol may start to go

2593.63 --> 2600.23
wild on you start to punish you make you

2596.45 --> 2605.0589999999997
do make you act out in stress or become

2600.23 --> 2607.839
really lonely or really angry see it's

2605.059 --> 2614.299
the same person the same alcohol

2607.839 --> 2616.63
different circumstances it really

2614.299 --> 2619.0
matters

2616.63 --> 2621.85
and that is one of the biggest pitfalls

2619.0 --> 2626.17
of all of humanity is that almost

2621.85 --> 2628.35
everybody doesn't really managed that

2626.17 --> 2632.59
too well

2628.35 --> 2636.7599999999998
they over generalize it they think it is

2632.59 --> 2642.54
always the solution that's a big problem

2636.76 --> 2642.5400000000004
with most humans Hey hello chocolate

2643.5 --> 2656.59
let's see if I can get some flat earth

2646.18 --> 2662.74
into this discussion all right oh I

2656.59 --> 2667.9
almost forgot this oh yeah so yeah I was

2662.74 --> 2668.62
looking at Russia today guess what it

2667.9 --> 2672.64
seems

2668.62 --> 2675.79
the moon landing supposed to happen

2672.64 --> 2677.77
yesterday by India which I actually

2675.79 --> 2681.43
talked about on my show a showed some

2677.77 --> 2685.15
pictures it seems like it was India

2681.43 --> 2688.2999999999997
calls off chandrayaan-2 lunar mission

2685.15 --> 2694.42
due to technical snag less than an hour

2688.3 --> 2698.23
before launch mm-hmm I guess I guess

2694.42 --> 2704.59
they were insecure about faking their

2698.23 --> 2706.36
moon landing after all it's it's yeah

2704.59 --> 2708.8500000000004
it's kind of similar to what happened

2706.36 --> 2714.76
with Israel well it it kind of shows CGI

2708.85 --> 2718.08
and and then it's supposedly crashed so

2714.76 --> 2718.0800000000004
yeah there it is

2727.33 --> 2730.71
let's see what it was

2734.49 --> 2740.8489999999997
no additional details about the problem

2737.67 --> 2745.2200000000003
or the new date of launch have yet been

2740.849 --> 2747.089
revealed by the Indian Space Research

2745.22 --> 2749.1899999999996
Organisation Wow

2747.089 --> 2758.88
so they didn't even give her a reason as

2749.19 --> 2761.869
to what the issue was so yeah that was a

2758.88 --> 2761.869
bummer

2773.43 --> 2780.7999999999997
but yeah that's kind of hilarious since

2775.8 --> 2780.8
I reviewed that that in the next day

2782.75 --> 2788.16
it's kind of sad isn't it although I

2785.55 --> 2793.59
wonder how many people from India even

2788.16 --> 2801.48
care about that stuff maybe it's just

2793.59 --> 2806.36
now let's not get too much into it so

2801.48 --> 2806.36
that happened let's see

2814.63 --> 2819.07
all right yeah well the other thing that

2816.28 --> 2822.46
pretty much happened everything pretty

2819.07 --> 2824.11
much discussed by now including the

2822.46 --> 2825.94
Brenda situation although yeah it's hard

2824.11 --> 2828.6400000000003
to get into details about that because

2825.94 --> 2833.86
she literally threw down the entire

2828.64 --> 2837.94
pellets all her ideas like how can you

2833.86 --> 2840.94
be specific that's like me can you even

2837.94 --> 2845.67
imagine that like me putting down all my

2840.94 --> 2848.86
ideas in a consecutive couple of hours

2845.67 --> 2850.51
like putting down a list of all the

2848.86 --> 2852.04
things that I could talk about and try

2850.51 --> 2853.5400000000004
to figure out what's the most sensible

2852.04 --> 2857.79
way of putting it all together in one

2853.54 --> 2862.21
presentation and then it's just like oh

2857.79 --> 2864.88
wow you do haven't refuted me yeah

2862.21 --> 2868.39
you're an idiot you don't understand no

2864.88 --> 2876.67
it's it's giant like what Brenda put

2868.39 --> 2878.8599999999997
down his giant you know it's like but it

2876.67 --> 2882.79
it wasn't really new it really was just

2878.86 --> 2885.9100000000003
everything that she's been sharing her

2882.79 --> 2888.22
angle to things which really doesn't

2885.91 --> 2889.83
have all that much logical consistency

2888.22 --> 2897.91
in the first place

2889.83 --> 2902.37
it's very loosely tied together relying

2897.91 --> 2906.48
heavily on on yeah authority and post

2902.37 --> 2909.8399999999997
systems and background information so

2906.48 --> 2914.22
yeah she leans heavily on the statist

2909.84 --> 2914.2200000000003
cosmo genie interpretation as it were

2921.19 --> 2924.19
mm-hmm

2942.72 --> 2945.6499999999996
hmm

3014.23 --> 3022.12
too late than your lap of you the Casa

3020.66 --> 3026.14
is gone

3022.12 --> 3026.14
long live the castle

3041.46 --> 3048.69
all right I see discussing Candida yeah

3044.79 --> 3053.16
Canada is a fungus in the body and it

3048.69 --> 3056.93
tries a lot on the side products that

3053.16 --> 3060.3489999999997
are manifesting when you consume sugar

3056.93 --> 3064.859
on the more processed something is

3060.349 --> 3067.67
especially with sugar the more grip

3064.859 --> 3067.67
Candida gets

3074.13 --> 3083.099
so sugar is the main key to get rid of

3079.38 --> 3086.579
Canada and if you combine that with

3083.099 --> 3089.069
certain type of other things then you

3086.579 --> 3092.279
can get it out you said like I very

3089.069 --> 3095.19
basically rely upon a product from Alex

3092.279 --> 3098.249
Jones I'm gonna bring it back it's just

3095.19 --> 3104.539
the thing it's a bottle that I have and

3098.249 --> 3104.5389999999998
I noticed its results so yeah

3111.96 --> 3117.57
and I don't get the idea need to take

3115.65 --> 3121.83
this every day so this is gonna last a

3117.57 --> 3125.8500000000004
long time but yeah it's my cozy ex and I

3121.83 --> 3130.56
still got most of the bottle like yeah

3125.85 --> 3133.89
most of it and this works really well so

3130.56 --> 3137.07
keep it low sugar and then if you know

3133.89 --> 3141.69
if you like extra debt and you start to

3137.07 --> 3144.09
note is like this this feels familiar

3141.69 --> 3147.69
the symptoms are starting the rise of

3144.09 --> 3150.33
high Candida presence in the body then I

3147.69 --> 3154.71
just take this for maybe a day or two

3150.33 --> 3157.89
maybe three and I'm over that and it

3154.71 --> 3161.9700000000003
also helps against what I experienced

3157.89 --> 3164.85
the actual that weird kick the hunger

3161.97 --> 3166.6499999999996
the addiction to sugar but that's my

3164.85 --> 3171.0299999999997
personal experience I don't know if

3166.65 --> 3173.96
that's supposed to do that but yeah I

3171.03 --> 3173.96
think it's a good product

3183.19 --> 3189.79
and hey sugar addiction is an issue with

3186.52 --> 3193.69
me so not so much anymore but when I was

3189.79 --> 3197.05
just a little kid I was pretty damn

3193.69 --> 3199.54
sugar addicted it yeah I exerted myself

3197.05 --> 3203.0800000000004
like I would eat myself literally

3199.54 --> 3205.39
throwing up sick with candy if I had

3203.08 --> 3208.2599999999998
that opportunity that I have had very

3205.39 --> 3208.2599999999998
little control

3218.02 --> 3222.3
why tweets okay interesting

3233.3 --> 3243.32
mm-hmm yep sugar clouds up the mind a

3236.96 --> 3246.8
little it does if you have just a very

3243.32 --> 3249.77
little amount of sugar then it's great

3246.8 --> 3253.52
that then it actually does give that

3249.77 --> 3258.08
little extra glucose but you need so

3253.52 --> 3262.67
little of it really do so getting too

3258.08 --> 3265.13
much is gonna overdo it and then you're

3262.67 --> 3268.91
gonna end up with yeah getting just

3265.13 --> 3274.1600000000003
being high and sugar and get like oh

3268.91 --> 3278.14
yeah it's like a zoom experience you get

3274.16 --> 3278.14
high in sugar yeah you do

3287.8 --> 3296.23
especially very young kids do and that

3293.619 --> 3298.869
is if they're lucky enough to get some

3296.23 --> 3301.2400000000002
sort of organic based candy because

3298.869 --> 3303.369
there's also candy out there that still

3301.24 --> 3306.1899999999996
has all these chemicals in them that

3303.369 --> 3307.33
will have even other side effects on top

3306.19 --> 3309.88
of that and long-term health

3307.33 --> 3313.39
consequences so oh thank you again

3309.88 --> 3318.9900000000002
Daniel Levy VA for the two-pound

3313.39 --> 3321.99
superjet donation class all thumbs up

3318.99 --> 3321.99
tangy

3335.75 --> 3346.68
anyway I'm pretty much blessed now with

3342.21 --> 3351.03
my taste in foods is that I don't really

3346.68 --> 3356.85
like sweetness in food a lot I'm much

3351.03 --> 3359.13
more of a hearty salty guy so for me I

3356.85 --> 3363.27
used to have issues with basically

3359.13 --> 3365.69
wanting too much salt my body can handle

3363.27 --> 3368.28
it pretty damn well considering

3365.69 --> 3372.66
but yeah it's too much it's never good

3368.28 --> 3375.4500000000003
but that really helped me it's always

3372.66 --> 3378.98
been like the candy candy sweet candy

3375.45 --> 3381.5699999999997
that's what I got addicted to but sweet

3378.98 --> 3385.25
dinner or something that kind of thing

3381.57 --> 3389.31
that never really drew me in too much

3385.25 --> 3391.35
you know except fruit of course fruit

3389.31 --> 3399.2999999999997
has to be a little sweet and a little

3391.35 --> 3403.92
sour maybe yeah but it helps a lot that

3399.3 --> 3406.38
I just that I'm not drawn in food habits

3403.92 --> 3409.65
to sweetness a lot that really helps me

3406.38 --> 3411.6600000000003
just get sugar out of the way the only

3409.65 --> 3414.29
place where I really end up getting

3411.66 --> 3416.5499999999997
sugar now is in my coffee

3414.29 --> 3420.18
including Tamera coffee and it just do a

3416.55 --> 3424.53
little just a little for the taste it's

3420.18 --> 3427.98
not enough to get me high on sugar it'll

3424.53 --> 3430.32
give me a little boost of activity so

3427.98 --> 3435.9900000000002
that makes focus just a little bit

3430.32 --> 3438.75
easier for a short while I think that

3435.99 --> 3441.8399999999997
lasts pretty much like 40 minutes and

3438.75 --> 3444.77
then it backs down again to normal

3441.84 --> 3447.65
levels something like that I think

3444.77 --> 3450.81
depends on my metabolism at the time

3447.65 --> 3453.32
anyway enough about that I'm gonna round

3450.81 --> 3453.32
out the show

3453.95 --> 3459.0699999999997
