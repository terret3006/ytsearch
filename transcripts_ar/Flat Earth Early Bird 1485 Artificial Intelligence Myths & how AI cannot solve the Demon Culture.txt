Not Crash all the time isn't it

121.38 --> 126.29899999999999
since I've been using this new one it

123.72 --> 130.16
hasn't like gotten stuck a single time

126.299 --> 130.16
not even on obs

130.259 --> 135.379
all right anyway yeah look at this it's

132.72 --> 135.379
pretty amazing

135.959 --> 138.86
foreign

151.98 --> 158.57999999999998
sunny

154.5 --> 161.28
there's a bit of that Haze up there

158.58 --> 165.42000000000002
I mean it could be

161.28 --> 168.0
it is kind of like Trail shaped

165.42 --> 171.55999999999997
but yeah I can be sure

168.0 --> 171.56
could just be a coincidence

173.34 --> 178.099
all right

175.56 --> 178.099
anyway

199.319 --> 202.319
chat

203.159 --> 213.239
uh it is

207.0 --> 213.239
Wednesday the 18th of January 2023

214.019 --> 216.98000000000002
check the temperature

220.019 --> 223.739
four degrees Celsius

227.819 --> 233.159
right well according to this it's going

230.099 --> 236.76
to be quite a beautiful day

233.159 --> 239.04
but according to the well no it makes no

236.76 --> 242.099
sense actually

239.04 --> 243.78
it predicts rain

242.099 --> 248.39999999999998
for Wednesday

243.78 --> 250.56
but it then for the for now it's bright

248.4 --> 252.06
and sunny

250.56 --> 254.879
I don't know maybe it's going to rain

252.06 --> 257.639
later on in the day it could be

254.879 --> 261.26
could be we'll see

257.639 --> 261.26
but for now it's quite beautiful

269.34 --> 272.94
all right yeah

273.0 --> 280.4
so I don't mention it too often but has

276.12 --> 280.4
anybody subscribed to my Twitter

282.0 --> 289.62
I do kind of like link up there now and

287.52 --> 292.75899999999996
yeah not a lot of other activities

289.62 --> 292.759
sometimes I do it

292.86 --> 298.759
also there's people just like

296.88 --> 301.02
pulling me in

298.759 --> 304.5
anti-flat earthers I don't know how to

301.02 --> 306.35999999999996
like unsubscribe from that or something

304.5 --> 308.52
it's very annoying I can't turn off

306.36 --> 310.68
those notifications so there's anti-flat

308.52 --> 313.52
earthers out there also

310.68 --> 313.52
of course

323.28 --> 328.75899999999996
right but yeah through Twitter is also a

325.68 --> 328.759
way to contact me

331.8 --> 339.479
and check if there is a live show

335.58 --> 341.46
uh like if your YouTube notifications of

339.479 --> 344.039
my channel aren't working properly for

341.46 --> 346.68
some people it does that

344.039 --> 349.8
you can always keep track of Twitter

346.68 --> 352.68
because every time I go live

349.8 --> 355.52000000000004
I post a little link

352.68 --> 355.52
that I'm live

355.62 --> 362.1
sounds boring but hey it's a good way to

359.52 --> 365.96
figure out if I'm going live if you're a

362.1 --> 365.96000000000004
YouTube notifications just suck

366.84 --> 372.79999999999995
hello awake the iron first in chat good

370.38 --> 372.8
to see you

373.1 --> 376.82000000000005
good morning to you

383.34 --> 386.06
ah

403.259 --> 408.91900000000004
man I'm gonna hit the 1500 before my

406.919 --> 411.9
next birthday

408.919 --> 414.68
it's pretty cool

411.9 --> 414.67999999999995
foreign

422.16 --> 427.56
even though I know I yeah for some

425.34 --> 429.78
people they're interested in me I guess

427.56 --> 433.039
well then you would have to be in a way

429.78 --> 433.039
to keep following my show

433.319 --> 438.78000000000003
and for others I think that I mean I'm

436.319 --> 442.319
not like a

438.78 --> 445.25899999999996
a major Flat Earth attraction although I

442.319 --> 446.94
have these traits but like oh you want

445.259 --> 449.539
that well then you have to deal with the

446.94 --> 449.539
rest as well

452.099 --> 457.68
so I'm not like super focused like for

455.099 --> 460.44
example Nathan is most of the time

457.68 --> 464.699
I mean he locked it talks like maybe 10

460.44 --> 468.18
about computers and cars sometimes but

464.699 --> 471.18
it is 90 super focused Flat Earth

468.18 --> 472.979
and I guess that that doesn't actually

471.18 --> 475.259
help you

472.979 --> 478.02
with becoming more prominent

475.259 --> 480.599
I am basically just a vlogger that also

478.02 --> 484.81899999999996
happens to be a flat earther

480.599 --> 484.819
probably according to the system

486.479 --> 489.9
like to the algorithm where it sizes me

489.12 --> 491.099
up

489.9 --> 493.46
so

491.099 --> 493.46
yeah

500.69 --> 503.889
[Music]

507.06 --> 510.68
all right anyway

511.8 --> 516.1800000000001
uh

513.24 --> 518.659
yesterday was overall kind of a bit of a

516.18 --> 518.659
boring day

519.419 --> 525.18
no flat Earth debate live I have no idea

522.18 --> 528.4799999999999
if Nathan's gonna go live today if he's

525.18 --> 533.2399999999999
got his computer back yet

528.48 --> 533.24
I'll check Skype if there's any

533.76 --> 537.019
no he hasn't said anything

541.5 --> 547.26
anyway I'll keep you posted

544.26 --> 549.86
during the live stream

547.26 --> 549.86
uh

551.279 --> 557.779
been watching a couple of Netflix movies

553.74 --> 557.779
but it wasn't like super interesting

559.74 --> 566.22
some Steven Seagal movie

562.32 --> 570.74
and man I'm like watching this

566.22 --> 570.74
and then realizing like okay

571.26 --> 576.72
even 20 years ago but especially like 25

574.74 --> 579.0
years ago I would have thought that

576.72 --> 581.88
movie was super badass

579.0 --> 585.18
right and now I'm looking at it and I'm

581.88 --> 588.42
suddenly seeing it much more for

585.18 --> 591.4799999999999
the theater piece that it is that movie

588.42 --> 593.0999999999999
such an action movie

591.48 --> 596.839
it's just

593.1 --> 596.839
it's weird seeing it like this

598.2 --> 604.86
but it's definitely not as entertaining

601.98 --> 607.44
it's just that

604.86 --> 609.48
I can't stick to like that surface level

607.44 --> 611.82
of approach which is really what it was

609.48 --> 615.0
meant for so like those types of movies

611.82 --> 617.6400000000001
are meant for younger people

615.0 --> 620.76
like teens

617.64 --> 624.3
late teens

620.76 --> 628.22
or they were meant for that age back

624.3 --> 628.2199999999999
then I mean now I don't know

629.16 --> 634.86
I think youngsters get into crazy [ __ ]

632.04 --> 638.36
very early unfortunately which is not

634.86 --> 638.36
good but uh

638.519 --> 643.88
watch that watch The Ninth Gate again

644.22 --> 648.86
interesting

646.079 --> 648.8599999999999
movie

649.56 --> 652.76
very ominous

653.959 --> 659.9399999999999
and but there's like an interesting

657.779 --> 663.6
like

659.94 --> 664.9100000000001
character Paradigm Dynamic happening in

663.6 --> 668.12
the ninth game

664.91 --> 668.12
[Music]

676.62 --> 682.04
discussion that fpd about swearing was

678.839 --> 682.0400000000001
interesting you thought so

683.399 --> 689.76
I'm so bored yeah I was

686.339 --> 692.399
like oh I want a vpg yeah no

689.76 --> 695.42
but apparently Nathan wants that it's

692.399 --> 695.42
gonna ruin the show

696.14 --> 699.54
if if it even really works that way I

698.82 --> 703.86
mean

699.54 --> 706.5
basically there could be just PG shows

703.86 --> 711.0
but not it's not always going to work it

706.5 --> 714.0
just it just isn't it just isn't

711.0 --> 718.14
and if you would try to force that

714.0 --> 720.36
uh yeah it's gonna probably ruin the

718.14 --> 723.86
chemistry to a degree

720.36 --> 723.86
except for Tenth man

723.959 --> 730.9799999999999
you can stick to that very easily

727.88 --> 733.019
yeah and Adam making

730.98 --> 736.1
but me

733.019 --> 736.1
I don't know like

737.399 --> 742.44
yeah

739.22 --> 746.1
I like to stay polite

742.44 --> 747.62
but if there's gonna be some just

746.1 --> 750.12
foreign

747.62 --> 752.4590000000001
manipulation things happening

750.12 --> 755.4590000000001
then it's gonna piss me off and then I

752.459 --> 758.9399999999999
will not be able to restrain that

755.459 --> 761.04
because it's very personal then

758.94 --> 763.62
and unnecessary and that makes it even

761.04 --> 766.019
more personal

763.62 --> 768.36
so

766.019 --> 770.7
I can't keep it that way and if that

768.36 --> 772.2
means oh yeah you can do it you're gonna

770.7 --> 775.22
be kicked out well then you're gonna

772.2 --> 775.22
have to do without me

775.56 --> 779.8199999999999
laughs

777.959 --> 781.92
or you're going to have to completely

779.82 --> 784.62
stop doing that

781.92 --> 787.8199999999999
stopping the unfair treatments

784.62 --> 787.82
that happen at time

789.779 --> 793.98
and when I try to lay down something

791.82 --> 795.9590000000001
carefully then you have to respect it

793.98 --> 798.4200000000001
you have to actually give it some

795.959 --> 800.88
respect I mean are you gonna rumpus Adam

798.42 --> 801.959
when he talk very carefully talks about

800.88 --> 803.1
his

801.959 --> 807.3599999999999
uh

803.1 --> 810.839
backed researched information

807.36 --> 813.72
no because you guys respect him nobody

810.839 --> 816.4200000000001
starts talking right over him well then

813.72 --> 818.4590000000001
I don't want that either I deserve that

816.42 --> 820.56
respect as well

818.459 --> 823.3199999999999
and maybe not when I'm like just kind of

820.56 --> 825.899
blabbery or whatever when I'm chatty and

823.32 --> 828.0600000000001
then you can just say yeah come on

825.899 --> 832.62
stop rumpusing everybody

828.06 --> 835.0189999999999
okay that's that's okay right but not if

832.62 --> 837.66
I'm like specifically

835.019 --> 842.54
like trying to perform

837.66 --> 842.54
some insight-based performance

842.579 --> 850.56
like when I'm arguing as Bowen

845.94 --> 853.0790000000001
then don't do that don't poo poo it

850.56 --> 855.2399999999999
and don't try to just shove me to the

853.079 --> 857.399
side

855.24 --> 860.0
because then I will get pissed off like

857.399 --> 860.0
the last time

861.779 --> 865.5
right

862.98 --> 868.639
and if there's a personal issue that you

865.5 --> 871.8
just can't stomach it for some reason

868.639 --> 875.24
then use a safe word just say I can't

871.8 --> 875.24
deal with this right now or

876.18 --> 879.8389999999999
something like that

878.12 --> 882.54
[Music]

879.839 --> 886.44
like can we not do this right now that

882.54 --> 888.5999999999999
works but you have to be like

886.44 --> 892.519
not in the middle of while I'm talking

888.6 --> 892.519
or even yelling that's too late

894.12 --> 898.68
you have to wait for a silent moment

895.98 --> 901.019
like basically you just have to let me

898.68 --> 904.7399999999999
finish that's what it comes down to just

901.019 --> 907.92
that you just have to let me finish and

904.74 --> 910.38
you Nathan of all people should know

907.92 --> 912.54
exactly how aggravating it is when

910.38 --> 914.959
people don't let you finish your

912.54 --> 914.959
sentence

916.74 --> 924.48
when it is in content not about the

921.06 --> 927.1199999999999
situation unfolding right that's meta

924.48 --> 928.9200000000001
talk who gives a [ __ ] that's kind of

927.12 --> 931.26
patronizing when you talk about a

928.92 --> 933.12
situation when you're still facing the

931.26 --> 936.48
person that involves the situation

933.12 --> 939.12
that's disrespectful you only do that if

936.48 --> 942.6
somebody's like really out of their

939.12 --> 945.48
minds and like double speaking not

942.6 --> 946.74
realizing it like a a real anti-flat

945.48 --> 950.76
earther

946.74 --> 953.76
I don't do that when I involve double

950.76 --> 956.9399999999999
speaking within my responses it is

953.76 --> 960.12
because I'm genuinely stuck Within

956.94 --> 961.6800000000001
that point in the simulation of being a

960.12 --> 964.98
baller

961.68 --> 969.079
I would never actually mentally get

964.98 --> 969.0790000000001
stuck in double speak okay

975.68 --> 982.26
right so yeah that's still my response

979.8 --> 984.92
to all that

982.26 --> 984.92
I don't know

998.18 --> 1001.41
[Music]

1006.62 --> 1010.18
hey clap rockers by the way

1016.279 --> 1018.639
right

1027.74 --> 1033.02
it's getting a little annoyanced

1030.559 --> 1035.72
right now 10th man has been like that

1033.02 --> 1038.9189999999999
from the start guns and everyone he's

1035.72 --> 1038.919
actually a lot better now

1044.839 --> 1052.28
and he is realizing that

1047.72 --> 1054.5
his disdain towards me is personal

1052.28 --> 1055.94
right because earlier he was with trying

1054.5 --> 1058.16
to like

1055.94 --> 1060.0800000000002
just he was on this weird Inquisition

1058.16 --> 1063.52
route

1060.08 --> 1063.52
he's not doing that anymore

1063.74 --> 1068.24
but he still has that impulse and he

1065.78 --> 1070.16
knows it's personal and he like I think

1068.24 --> 1072.919
10th Man 10th man has actually been

1070.16 --> 1075.0800000000002
pretty reasonable towards me

1072.919 --> 1077.419
but he still annoys the [ __ ] out of me

1075.08 --> 1080.1789999999999
and he's just very dragging

1077.419 --> 1083.419
some time like dragging points out that

1080.179 --> 1085.52
are really not interesting like I drag

1083.419 --> 1087.5590000000002
points out a bit sometimes I get a bit

1085.52 --> 1091.059
repetitive because I'm like really like

1087.559 --> 1091.059
this is really interesting

1096.14 --> 1101.3600000000001
let's just

1097.58 --> 1104.059
but he just sometimes drags out things

1101.36 --> 1107.12
that are not interesting and then it's

1104.059 --> 1109.6
like uh okay

1107.12 --> 1109.6
right

1113.6 --> 1118.9599999999998
I wouldn't say Alzheimer's though that's

1115.58 --> 1118.96
a bit far gone to never run

1119.179 --> 1123.22
I don't understand why you think that

1125.72 --> 1133.46
is forgetful and stuttering 10th Man

1130.1 --> 1135.32
I know not really dude I get forgetful

1133.46 --> 1137.5
and stuttering sometimes are you saying

1135.32 --> 1141.52
I have Alzheimer's

1137.5 --> 1141.52
it's just ups and downs

1149.059 --> 1155.96
right I I don't think he has like a lack

1152.24 --> 1159.26
of faculties or anything

1155.96 --> 1162.14
like not anything that is like a serious

1159.26 --> 1164.72
detriment but

1162.14 --> 1167.72
it's just the way he does things

1164.72 --> 1169.76
and that could be because he is older

1167.72 --> 1172.28
because he's used to doing it in another

1169.76 --> 1174.14
type of Rhythm because things did all

1172.28 --> 1176.72
get go

1174.14 --> 1180.26
at an easier pace

1176.72 --> 1182.78
certain like spiritual ways

1180.26 --> 1186.4
Comfort conversing ways

1182.78 --> 1186.3999999999999
and that is a bit annoying

1187.1 --> 1193.059
but I mean he's definitely not like

1193.22 --> 1199.419
losing his mind or anything I wouldn't

1196.58 --> 1199.4189999999999
say that at all

1202.7 --> 1207.38
he's a good man until his school yeah

1205.1 --> 1211.82
well if when he gets religiously

1207.38 --> 1215.5
fanatical yeah then he becomes well

1211.82 --> 1215.5
a blustering zealot

1216.2 --> 1222.02
but that's that's that's religious

1218.9 --> 1224.419
fanaticism that's like because that is

1222.02 --> 1225.679
when he responds very personal and then

1224.419 --> 1228.98
yeah

1225.679 --> 1232.8200000000002
that that demon is still there and then

1228.98 --> 1235.16
is allowed like oh so this is the excuse

1232.82 --> 1237.5
you need to be like this basically right

1235.16 --> 1240.3200000000002
that's that's the entire problem with

1237.5 --> 1243.559
religious fanaticism it's so ironic that

1240.32 --> 1246.08
a lot of religious fanatics

1243.559 --> 1247.94
think they're really good but because

1246.08 --> 1251.0
they're religious fanatic they get

1247.94 --> 1255.02
demonic like in pursuit of people acting

1251.0 --> 1258.74
demonic acting demonic while doing it

1255.02 --> 1261.26
it's a really creepy trick

1258.74 --> 1262.46
of Satan you could say because they

1261.26 --> 1266.14
don't

1262.46 --> 1266.14
often realize it

1267.5 --> 1271.52
they really think that is Justified

1270.0 --> 1274.059
[Music]

1271.52 --> 1274.059
anyway

1276.86 --> 1281.78
I get pissed when you get shot huh what

1280.58 --> 1284.6
yeah

1281.78 --> 1287.539
no me too guns then

1284.6 --> 1290.299
I I appreciate that you resonate

1287.539 --> 1293.72
definitely because it makes me feel

1290.299 --> 1297.5
really alone when they do that

1293.72 --> 1300.74
but I I'm glad that well

1297.5 --> 1303.559
that not everybody's like yeah yeah man

1300.74 --> 1308.32
Arwin totally deserved that I'm really

1303.559 --> 1308.32
glad there's mostly trolls

1314.24 --> 1319.46
and people that just really don't like

1316.159 --> 1323.0800000000002
me which can be out there I mean I've

1319.46 --> 1323.08
been pretty brutal and direct

1324.74 --> 1332.299
I mean I might have even analyzed people

1328.4 --> 1336.6200000000001
in like purely meaning good things but

1332.299 --> 1338.6
like being way too exposing by accident

1336.62 --> 1340.52
because that is the standard that I

1338.6 --> 1344.1789999999999
uphold for myself

1340.52 --> 1346.4
like I expect to be deep analyzed

1344.179 --> 1348.5
but they have to do it correctly because

1346.4 --> 1350.6000000000001
I know how to do it I've done it with me

1348.5 --> 1353.9
all the time

1350.6 --> 1355.6999999999998
and I've like made mistakes about it and

1353.9 --> 1357.799
I realized how they were mistakes and

1355.7 --> 1360.8600000000001
just like I know how to analyze my

1357.799 --> 1363.1589999999999
situation myself how I function very

1360.86 --> 1363.1589999999999
well

1363.559 --> 1365.86
foreign

1366.679 --> 1372.3200000000002
so yeah if somebody is going to judge me

1369.5 --> 1375.799
I am going to actually

1372.32 --> 1378.02
like take that serious and then give my

1375.799 --> 1380.72
analysis of their analysis

1378.02 --> 1382.7
and how correct they were

1380.72 --> 1386.179
that's something I do

1382.7 --> 1388.1000000000001
if somebody engages but most people that

1386.179 --> 1389.9
have analyzed what's either been just a

1388.1 --> 1391.58
quick compliment like Nathan has given

1389.9 --> 1393.679
me plenty of compliments and I really

1391.58 --> 1395.299
appreciate that

1393.679 --> 1399.76
foreign

1395.299 --> 1399.76
but a lot of other people not so much

1403.78 --> 1410.829
tomorrow right thanks

1407.76 --> 1410.829
[Music]

1413.059 --> 1416.9189999999999
I could certainly use it a lot

1420.52 --> 1428.84
fpt needs the spice it's a trademark

1426.26 --> 1431.98
it's not just the trademark it's it's

1428.84 --> 1431.98
part of the chemistry

1432.98 --> 1438.02
the one thing that I've noticed is that

1435.02 --> 1440.48
every time that I've exploded and like

1438.02 --> 1442.58
almost unreasonably loud exploded

1440.48 --> 1446.48
because it's like this tension

1442.58 --> 1449.1789999999999
everybody's super calm but I'm not calm

1446.48 --> 1451.28
or everybody seems calm suppressing it

1449.179 --> 1453.6200000000001
then I'm suppressing it but that at some

1451.28 --> 1455.48
point just the spark just gets into that

1453.62 --> 1456.7399999999998
powder cack and then it gets super

1455.48 --> 1460.159
energetic

1456.74 --> 1462.32
and every time that's happened well has

1460.159 --> 1465.7990000000002
usually resulted in just everybody

1462.32 --> 1467.78
lighting up like a Christmas tree after

1465.799 --> 1471.3799999999999
that point even after I left and then

1467.78 --> 1474.7
just really being super focused it's

1471.38 --> 1474.7
kind of funny a side effect

1474.919 --> 1479.3600000000001
that's never going to be the reason why

1476.9 --> 1482.0
I do it though because I don't I never

1479.36 --> 1484.58
do those things on purpose

1482.0 --> 1489.02
it just happens

1484.58 --> 1491.4189999999999
and I just let it happen spontaneous

1489.02 --> 1493.7
I would never push something like that

1491.419 --> 1497.0200000000002
artificially would never try to fool

1493.7 --> 1497.02
people with emotions

1504.02 --> 1507.46
like in a heated moment

1509.12 --> 1513.9189999999999
unless my life was in danger or

1511.4 --> 1514.88
something right but yeah obviously it

1513.919 --> 1517.24
isn't

1514.88 --> 1520.3290000000002
on the internet

1517.24 --> 1520.329
[Music]

1522.86 --> 1526.289
um

1523.2 --> 1526.289
[Music]

1541.22 --> 1545.26
pretty much understanding

1545.84 --> 1550.6399999999999
right

1547.159 --> 1554.6200000000001
but yeah guns never like I don't I don't

1550.64 --> 1554.6200000000001
respect the King James Bible at all

1555.2 --> 1562.279
I think it is a very much like

1559.12 --> 1564.1399999999999
popularized version from back then and

1562.279 --> 1566.24
it is gravel

1564.14 --> 1569.48
there's a lot of information that's just

1566.24 --> 1572.659
not there and Priestly interpretation

1569.48 --> 1575.72
that has been overemphasized so it is

1572.659 --> 1577.3400000000001
basically a even further corrupted

1575.72 --> 1580.04
version

1577.34 --> 1582.3799999999999
from the original

1580.04 --> 1586.96
[Music]

1582.38 --> 1586.96
and if he is all about that well

1587.659 --> 1593.659
I mean yes his problems

1590.96 --> 1597.6200000000001
if you're gonna pin yourself to that

1593.659 --> 1600.0800000000002
piece of paper so that way and all the

1597.62 --> 1602.059
Priestly interpretations that have come

1600.08 --> 1604.58
grown on top of it

1602.059 --> 1607.1
well that's your bag then

1604.58 --> 1609.02
right that's your belief of that you

1607.1 --> 1612.799
you're the you're the special boy

1609.02 --> 1615.08
because of that book that specific piece

1612.799 --> 1616.52
of paper with the words arranged in that

1615.08 --> 1618.799
way

1616.52 --> 1620.779
and with the interpretations on top well

1618.799 --> 1622.46
that's your issue then I think that's

1620.779 --> 1625.159
ridiculous

1622.46 --> 1628.8400000000001
I think that any religion that does that

1625.159 --> 1628.8400000000001
specifically is ridiculous

1629.36 --> 1636.86
to be exclusion exclusionists like only

1632.96 --> 1640.039
our way like that immediately for me

1636.86 --> 1642.02
just eh

1640.039 --> 1644.919
wrong

1642.02 --> 1644.9189999999999
ridiculous

1645.02 --> 1651.32
like absolutely ridiculous like for God

1647.72 --> 1656.26
to even arrange yet something to work

1651.32 --> 1660.02
like that is ridiculous why because

1656.26 --> 1662.539
it'll only serve everything the railroad

1660.02 --> 1665.96
and then get stuck

1662.539 --> 1669.3799999999999
like in the peak of an asymptote it it's

1665.96 --> 1670.64
not gonna it's not an efficient game

1669.38 --> 1675.6200000000001
plan

1670.64 --> 1677.419
part like I I can derive that much from

1675.62 --> 1680.0
God's design like that makes an

1677.419 --> 1684.6200000000001
absolutely no sense

1680.0 --> 1686.48
it is what you do how you do it

1684.62 --> 1690.1999999999998
that is important

1686.48 --> 1692.9
it's important palpably in your lifetime

1690.2 --> 1696.919
in your dreams

1692.9 --> 1698.9
and well arguably after death but that

1696.919 --> 1702.159
at that point really becomes secondary

1698.9 --> 1702.159
one can only hope

1702.2 --> 1704.38
foreign

1704.96 --> 1711.02
but to believe and become exclusionists

1707.779 --> 1712.46
to me is like already a seduction of the

1711.02 --> 1716.059
devil

1712.46 --> 1719.44
it is directly countering

1716.059 --> 1719.44
Christ's method

1724.76 --> 1729.4
that he worked against that entire

1730.159 --> 1736.5800000000002
starting point that that first point

1733.279 --> 1738.5
like oh only us only us

1736.58 --> 1742.24
no

1738.5 --> 1742.24
everybody gets a chance

1743.24 --> 1746.9
that's what he was there for

1745.279 --> 1750.44
so right

1746.9 --> 1754.3400000000001
like these are like esoteric Foundation

1750.44 --> 1756.5
Stones like this is

1754.34 --> 1759.86
the Cornerstone of

1756.5 --> 1763.27
of his Heritage like just those couple

1759.86 --> 1765.4399999999998
of principles mean everything

1763.27 --> 1767.6
[Music]

1765.44 --> 1769.7
and so as soon as you start like oh

1767.6 --> 1772.52
we're gonna have the church

1769.7 --> 1775.279
and we're going to have this Bible and

1772.52 --> 1777.3799999999999
we are the chosen one because of that

1775.279 --> 1781.1
and everybody that believes in that book

1777.38 --> 1783.38
and do as we do they are the chosen ones

1781.1 --> 1785.12
they go to heaven and the rest always

1783.38 --> 1788.419
doomed

1785.12 --> 1792.1999999999998
like that is immediately

1788.419 --> 1794.24
a Breaking of Christ's way

1792.2 --> 1796.76
immediately

1794.24 --> 1799.299
and that's something I will never let go

1796.76 --> 1799.299
ever

1799.88 --> 1805.0
because it is like a spiritual truth

1803.12 --> 1808.6999999999998
that should

1805.0 --> 1811.64
ride through all cultures and religions

1808.7 --> 1813.679
and yes you want to some cultures

1811.64 --> 1815.659
probably want to separate

1813.679 --> 1816.5
other groups from themselves right I

1815.659 --> 1819.5590000000002
mean

1816.5 --> 1822.32
that is still sensible seek your own

1819.559 --> 1826.46
seek out your own

1822.32 --> 1829.1
but to then put like this

1826.46 --> 1832.159
philosophical discipline on top of it

1829.1 --> 1837.08
like only our own and no and everybody

1832.159 --> 1841.24
else is doomed right that's just too far

1837.08 --> 1841.24
I mean give them a chance

1844.76 --> 1848.899
everybody has baggage

1847.279 --> 1850.82
in this life

1848.899 --> 1852.1399999999999
start out with it you make a lot of

1850.82 --> 1854.84
mistakes when you're young you go

1852.14 --> 1858.2
dwelling and sometimes you don't

1854.84 --> 1860.899
overcome certain types of dwelling

1858.2 --> 1862.279
and then you get kind of stuck in a

1860.899 --> 1864.02
level

1862.279 --> 1866.559
but that doesn't mean that that is it

1864.02 --> 1868.76
forever that's only it forever if you

1866.559 --> 1873.2
resign to that

1868.76 --> 1876.559
if you can take the punishment

1873.2 --> 1878.96
of knowing that you could be more

1876.559 --> 1881.36
and working towards it because that is

1878.96 --> 1883.76
punishing because if you look at it like

1881.36 --> 1887.0
that esoterically spiritually for

1883.76 --> 1888.919
yourself like man I could be better

1887.0 --> 1890.539
here's how and how but this is

1888.919 --> 1894.0200000000002
everything that I would have to stop

1890.539 --> 1895.76
doing Etc and do this to that that's

1894.02 --> 1897.98
punishing when you're not doing it and

1895.76 --> 1900.32
it's very hard so a lot of people then

1897.98 --> 1903.08
resigned to know

1900.32 --> 1905.9189999999999
I'm it's not me I'm just gonna do what

1903.08 --> 1905.9189999999999
I'm doing right now

1908.659 --> 1912.7600000000002
it's in a way what happened to me

1914.539 --> 1918.62
let's do punishing

1916.88 --> 1921.159
right

1918.62 --> 1921.1589999999999
uh

1922.58 --> 1926.6
it's going to be fed today I don't know

1924.44 --> 1928.3990000000001
haven't had any messages from Nathan

1926.6 --> 1930.3799999999999
about it yet

1928.399 --> 1932.6589999999999
wrong

1930.38 --> 1936.0390000000002
hey Kai from Gore by the way and Terry

1932.659 --> 1936.0390000000002
306 good to see you

1936.74 --> 1938.919
foreign

1947.46 --> 1954.14
[Music]

1952.279 --> 1955.159
but something that I've overall have

1954.14 --> 1958.039
learned

1955.159 --> 1962.5390000000002
and this is like a human study that even

1958.039 --> 1965.86
goes back to like my early teens

1962.539 --> 1970.1589999999999
is that this polarization effect right

1965.86 --> 1973.039
we nobody else it well leads to

1970.159 --> 1974.779
discrimination fundamentally like that's

1973.039 --> 1977.0
what starts happening

1974.779 --> 1979.52
if you isolate yourself

1977.0 --> 1982.76
and if you then act towards that

1979.52 --> 1985.279
separation that becomes discrimination

1982.76 --> 1987.8799999999999
but not not just that though damn it now

1985.279 --> 1987.88
I lost my point

1992.559 --> 1996.1
separation right

1998.96 --> 2001.6200000000001
damn it

2006.24 --> 2011.26
might have something to do with it I had

2008.74 --> 2013.299
a beer again yesterday I'm not gonna get

2011.26 --> 2016.2
one today

2013.299 --> 2016.2
I think

2024.059 --> 2030.0
who am I kidding I can't even afford

2026.86 --> 2030.0
that by the way so

2031.91 --> 2036.8200000000002
[Music]

2034.059 --> 2038.2
I'll be glad if I be able to get some

2036.82 --> 2041.98
smokes

2038.2 --> 2044.64
because I'm ran out of tobacco

2041.98 --> 2044.64
uh

2048.72 --> 2052.839
foreign

2050.28 --> 2055.8390000000004
but anyway yeah the whole spiritual

2052.839 --> 2057.339
polarization and separation it is a big

2055.839 --> 2061.02
thing

2057.339 --> 2061.02
if I ever been to Japan no

2067.119 --> 2071.32
cool things are well there's a lot of

2068.8 --> 2073.619
thing I mean Japan is a very interesting

2071.32 --> 2073.619
country

2075.7 --> 2080.4399999999996
they have amazing

2077.639 --> 2082.78
cultural heritage like because they

2080.44 --> 2085.899
really

2082.78 --> 2088.32
they really care for their cultural

2085.899 --> 2088.3199999999997
heritage

2095.379 --> 2100.6189999999997
chat GPT I don't know what that is

2104.92 --> 2109.48
yeah by the way I was linked to videos

2107.26 --> 2112.44
yesterday

2109.48 --> 2112.44
uh

2112.54 --> 2120.18
those about like the biblical trees

2116.079 --> 2120.1800000000003
that was a really good video

2121.18 --> 2127.5989999999997
like much more refined without any

2125.079 --> 2129.76
Savannah nonsense in it

2127.599 --> 2131.98
that was yeah

2129.76 --> 2134.8
intense

2131.98 --> 2138.4
made me think also about

2134.8 --> 2140.98
like the Age of Wonders again

2138.4 --> 2146.32
what would it have been like

2140.98 --> 2149.26
with Giants and just gigantic trees

2146.32 --> 2152.02
that were basically like naturally

2149.26 --> 2156.579
natural castles

2152.02 --> 2158.92
the I mean the giant trees were probably

2156.579 --> 2161.8
kind of like

2158.92 --> 2163.54
yeah well a giant castle that is just a

2161.8 --> 2165.76
living tree

2163.54 --> 2170.82
that they would have

2165.76 --> 2170.82
just carve hallways and everything in it

2179.38 --> 2185.8
or because like it's such an advantage

2182.8 --> 2188.32
to have a massively well a tower it's

2185.8 --> 2190.5
massive advantage to have a tower like

2188.32 --> 2192.339
that's even recognized

2190.5 --> 2194.079
generally

2192.339 --> 2197.099
in war

2194.079 --> 2199.0600000000004
right Towers you have better oversight

2197.099 --> 2201.2200000000003
great for

2199.06 --> 2203.32
ranged weaponry

2201.22 --> 2205.24
like even with bows

2203.32 --> 2207.9
you can have a massive Advantage because

2205.24 --> 2207.8999999999996
you can just

2208.0 --> 2215.44
aim better and shoot much farther

2210.88 --> 2218.56
down then anybody could ever do up

2215.44 --> 2221.099
they could even spot you in there

2218.56 --> 2221.099
so

2222.82 --> 2227.98
I'm just yeah just that that video

2225.46 --> 2231.9
definitely made me picture

2227.98 --> 2231.9
what it would have been like in a way

2245.76 --> 2253.5400000000004
only once when the factory enters to

2248.619 --> 2255.96
really okay weird oh wait the chat yeah

2253.54 --> 2255.96
that's

2260.56 --> 2268.02
it's the AI Chat thing right

2264.4 --> 2268.02
no I haven't tried it out

2279.16 --> 2285.839
but other countries have I been to uh

2282.64 --> 2285.839
well not that many

2286.3 --> 2290.38
as a baby I went to America United

2288.82 --> 2293.76
States

2290.38 --> 2293.76
uh other than that

2294.64 --> 2301.359
I've been to Germany

2296.859 --> 2304.5989999999997
and been through France to Spain East

2301.359 --> 2304.5989999999997
Coast Northeast

2305.32 --> 2312.2200000000003
that and Portico Portugal once that's

2309.22 --> 2316.14
like when I was like six or something

2312.22 --> 2316.14
five I don't remember a long time ago

2316.66 --> 2323.2799999999997
but yeah that's pretty much it been

2319.24 --> 2323.2799999999997
Spain and Germany a couple of times

2330.16 --> 2332.5789999999997
foreign

2340.34 --> 2344.8
[Music]

2341.579 --> 2347.46
ever heard of that not much of a book

2344.8 --> 2347.46
reader though

2349.0 --> 2354.54
is there like a pdf version of it I

2351.64 --> 2354.54
might take a look

2357.099 --> 2361.06
anyway if you find that Matthew Mitchell

2359.2 --> 2363.6499999999996
then like send it

2361.06 --> 2366.84
to my email that would be great

2363.65 --> 2366.84
[Music]

2368.88 --> 2372.099
[Music]

2375.579 --> 2381.1800000000003
what

2377.079 --> 2381.1800000000003
are you talking about Aries 106

2382.18 --> 2386.04
hey seeking star water good to see you

2388.74 --> 2393.2799999999997
write the race shot

2391.119 --> 2396.1800000000003
Sarah structure

2393.28 --> 2396.1800000000003
uh

2411.94 --> 2414.9
I don't know

2415.78 --> 2418.92
it was probably

2420.52 --> 2427.32
some old yeah

2423.82 --> 2427.32
trade Hub or something

2427.48 --> 2431.859
or in Outpost maybe some kind of

2430.06 --> 2435.599
military Outpost but yeah it certainly

2431.859 --> 2435.5989999999997
has been completely wiped

2436.079 --> 2441.4
so that's roughly what I think about it

2439.06 --> 2444.5789999999997
I mean there's a lot of speculation like

2441.4 --> 2447.06
oh it's Atlantis so this is that

2444.579 --> 2447.0600000000004
but

2448.66 --> 2452.8799999999997
is it

2450.099 --> 2452.88
I don't know

2456.52 --> 2462.04
the USA okay

2459.48 --> 2464.26
is that called The Yoga cycle I didn't

2462.04 --> 2465.88
know that right but I do know about the

2464.26 --> 2467.38
long cycle

2465.88 --> 2471.94
which

2467.38 --> 2474.1600000000003
was like somewhere around 24 24

2471.94 --> 2478.44
000 years right

2474.16 --> 2478.44
the great cycle the greatest

2479.02 --> 2485.64
do I like ants what no

2481.96 --> 2485.64
well I don't dislike them but

2490.32 --> 2494.82
I wouldn't want ants in my house

2497.2 --> 2501.269
foreign

2498.07 --> 2501.2690000000002
[Music]

2501.82 --> 2507.1800000000003
quite

2503.98 --> 2507.18
for their body weight

2522.82 --> 2529.38
but then again like you have to realize

2525.28 --> 2529.38
that technically the smaller you get

2529.54 --> 2535.9
the lighter you get and in relation to

2533.44 --> 2538.78
how your weight everything is going to

2535.9 --> 2542.02
get stronger small creatures

2538.78 --> 2546.0
compared to their weight are very much

2542.02 --> 2546.0
stronger than larger grades are

2546.7 --> 2550.8999999999996
the larger you are the more you

2548.8 --> 2553.92
basically use all your strength just to

2550.9 --> 2553.92
haul around your weight

2554.38 --> 2559.32
and you don't have that burden as a very

2556.54 --> 2559.32
little creature

2560.98 --> 2566.26
so then you are effectively much

2563.8 --> 2569.26
stronger than your F yeah your body

2566.26 --> 2572.0200000000004
weight so that is for ants that is like

2569.26 --> 2575.2200000000003
maximize

2572.02 --> 2575.22
they're famous for it

2579.47 --> 2584.5
[Music]

2581.02 --> 2588.94
so that's my AI answer it's a human AI

2584.5 --> 2591.54
answer okay it's not very mathematical

2588.94 --> 2591.54
uh

2598.78 --> 2601.78
okay

2604.66 --> 2607.66
insects

2608.319 --> 2611.52
that's [ __ ] up

2620.14 --> 2625.2999999999997
well maybe yeah maybe they're going to

2622.72 --> 2629.2799999999997
just mind control

2625.3 --> 2629.28
the entire insect Realm

2629.74 --> 2635.2599999999998
who knows man

2631.599 --> 2637.78
maybe maybe that's why Klaus Schwab is

2635.26 --> 2640.48
promoting bugs because he wants more

2637.78 --> 2643.6800000000003
bugs around because they can actually I

2640.48 --> 2643.68
don't know use some kind of

2644.319 --> 2648.54
radio mind control on them now

2655.24 --> 2661.18
I don't know

2657.579 --> 2663.52
I think it like I think that it is a bit

2661.18 --> 2665.74
far-fetched I think that

2663.52 --> 2668.74
we are basically getting a little

2665.74 --> 2675.04
overwhelmed by the quality

2668.74 --> 2677.319
of or well the the the progressed nature

2675.04 --> 2678.7599999999998
of the science fiction that is going

2677.319 --> 2681.06
around

2678.76 --> 2684.1600000000003
so people are definitely imagining

2681.06 --> 2686.38
nanobot [ __ ] and all that but like it

2684.16 --> 2688.5989999999997
really is that really going to happen

2686.38 --> 2690.7000000000003
though you know

2688.599 --> 2693.7000000000003
I mean just because it works all super

2690.7 --> 2695.5
smoothly in the science fiction

2693.7 --> 2698.4399999999996
doesn't mean that it's actually going to

2695.5 --> 2701.56
be that effective in the real world and

2698.44 --> 2704.38
there's countless examples of this like

2701.56 --> 2706.599
all spread throughout science fiction

2704.38 --> 2708.88
all these things there's like oh look at

2706.599 --> 2711.1600000000003
how we worked it out so easy to do or

2708.88 --> 2713.92
just to be like oh look at the luxury

2711.16 --> 2716.0789999999997
work so well oh we could do this yeah

2713.92 --> 2718.66
yeah you can't

2716.079 --> 2723.6400000000003
they can do that they can just Bluff

2718.66 --> 2726.16
that in the story because it's a story

2723.64 --> 2730.02
and they can pull it off

2726.16 --> 2730.02
in the real world no

2730.66 --> 2737.46
that's a lot of things

2733.599 --> 2737.46
a lot a lot of things

2738.88 --> 2741.48
right

2741.72 --> 2748.98
and yeah I think it's very far-fetched

2745.359 --> 2748.98
to assume that they're just going to

2749.14 --> 2754.24
literally

2750.88 --> 2756.96
use insects to that degree

2754.24 --> 2760.0
I mean they might

2756.96 --> 2761.7400000000002
engineer some of them I mean like with

2760.0 --> 2764.74
mosquitoes and [ __ ]

2761.74 --> 2767.6189999999997
and just wreak

2764.74 --> 2771.4799999999996
havoc and degeneration they could turn

2767.619 --> 2771.48
them into plagues right

2771.64 --> 2776.7999999999997
sure

2773.92 --> 2781.2400000000002
and they had to [ __ ] everything up

2776.8 --> 2783.6400000000003
and then keep [ __ ] everything up

2781.24 --> 2785.8799999999997
so they're probably just not gonna do

2783.64 --> 2785.8799999999997
that

2786.64 --> 2791.56
I mean if it would really be that

2788.859 --> 2793.72
impactful they probably wouldn't do it

2791.56 --> 2796.24
is much easier to just make everybody

2793.72 --> 2798.9399999999996
believe like they're being overwhelmed

2796.24 --> 2801.64
by an overwhelming power that they could

2798.94 --> 2803.98
never even dream to touch right

2801.64 --> 2805.5989999999997
what better way to mind control

2803.98 --> 2807.64
everybody

2805.599 --> 2810.94
than just having people that believe

2807.64 --> 2813.8799999999997
that and then spread that belief

2810.94 --> 2816.359

there's a reason why I'm not super eager

2938.319 --> 2942.359
to engage with that thing okay

2942.64 --> 2949.98
you don't know what that's going to

2945.94 --> 2949.98
like amalgamate into

2952.72 --> 2959.14
something that's that dynamic

2955.54 --> 2961.24
you don't know what like what somebody's

2959.14 --> 2965.7
gonna

2961.24 --> 2965.7
ask it to engineer for them

2974.74 --> 2980.2

2977.5 --> 2985.079
yeah but what is it what is its nature

2980.2 --> 2985.0789999999997
when is it going to stop advising you

2985.42 --> 2990.2200000000003

2988.54 --> 2994.06
sensory

2990.22 --> 2997.48
programmed into it at all

2994.06 --> 2998.619

2998.619 --> 3003.26
give them the answers

as the AI sizes it up like

3011.4 --> 3015.9
what is it what is that thing you're

3013.619 --> 3017.76
actually communicating with you know do

3015.9 --> 3019.8
you what do you know about

3017.76 --> 3022.8590000000004
what it's programmed for

3019.8 --> 3026.42
other than adapting to you

3022.859 --> 3026.42
and trying to answer you

3030.42 --> 3036.1800000000003
hello Amanda Young by the way good to

3032.28 --> 3038.5400000000004
see you in aries106 Dusty Lynn gravel

3036.18 --> 3038.54
sporn

3043.2 --> 3047.7799999999997
no I don't know anything about the

3045.18 --> 3047.7799999999997
morgyle

3066.78 --> 3072.26
so it learns from Earth

3069.3 --> 3072.26
foreign

3075.68 --> 3079.94
default Aries 106.

3088.26 --> 3093.0
I mean yeah feedback

3090.9 --> 3096.839
that's pretty cool

3093.0 --> 3099.359
that you can do that so is that the only

3096.839 --> 3102.5
way for it to actually attain

3099.359 --> 3102.5
information then

3104.64 --> 3111.0
I highly doubt it

3107.099 --> 3113.46
that's just an opinion board

3111.0 --> 3114.96
that's a bunch of suggestion boards like

3113.46 --> 3117.119
that I mean

3114.96 --> 3119.52
oh you can give feedback yeah what you

3117.119 --> 3121.7400000000002
think is not taking feedback as you're

3119.52 --> 3124.859
using it

3121.74 --> 3128.04
it's not just like oh

3124.859 --> 3130.68
a person I'm figuring out this person

3128.04 --> 3133.2599999999998
through the questions he asks and or he

3130.68 --> 3136.2
or she and

3133.26 --> 3138.3590000000004
the way they write and other things

3136.2 --> 3140.96
other methods that humans can barely

3138.359 --> 3140.96
comprehend

3141.9 --> 3148.98
because of like massive like does it

3144.9 --> 3151.14
have the massive cash of metadata that

3148.98 --> 3153.9
Mega corporations have gathered does it

3151.14 --> 3157.5
have that available to it

3153.9 --> 3161.099
do you know if it does

3157.5 --> 3163.22
maybe the freaking thing literally knows

3161.099 --> 3163.2200000000003
you

3167.28 --> 3172.079
through the metadata

3169.26 --> 3175.94
does it have it available to it I don't

3172.079 --> 3175.94
know but it could be

3176.16 --> 3180.48
I mean that would certainly help a long

3178.68 --> 3183.2999999999997
way in

3180.48 --> 3186.42
profiling somebody that you're trying to

3183.3 --> 3188.6600000000003
respond to on their level

3186.42 --> 3191.28
if you had all that metadata available

3188.66 --> 3194.8999999999996
for the AI

3191.28 --> 3194.9
so does it

3198.13 --> 3201.329
[Music]

3201.599 --> 3204.599
foreign

3207.839 --> 3213.119
good private policy

3210.78 --> 3216.48
oh I'm sure they're not literally gonna

3213.119 --> 3219.059
talk like they're not gonna leak the

3216.48 --> 3222.18
literal things you say to it but that

3219.059 --> 3225.42
doesn't mean that it like gets massive

3222.18 --> 3228.44
amounts of data other than literally

3225.42 --> 3228.44
what you're saying

3240.54 --> 3243.54
foreign

3266.24 --> 3273.0
that's with the actual interaction but

3270.18 --> 3275.46
the metadata is all the extra data that

3273.0 --> 3277.26
is gathered around through devices and

3275.46 --> 3280.2
computers

3277.26 --> 3281.0400000000004
that are stored secretly most of the

3280.2 --> 3283.4399999999996
time

3281.04 --> 3286.38
in databases

3283.44 --> 3289.64
and those are like little factoids that

3286.38 --> 3289.6400000000003
are picked up about you

3290.28 --> 3296.76
and there's even AIS of course there are

3295.079 --> 3299.819
that

3296.76 --> 3301.98
are very good at sizing up an individual

3299.819 --> 3305.42
purely by metadata

3301.98 --> 3305.42
it could be connected

3315.96 --> 3319.4
you need your phone numbers

3319.74 --> 3327.02
wow so you need an identification to

3324.3 --> 3327.02
interact with it

3328.02 --> 3333.3
basically

3329.579 --> 3336.0
can't just anonymously within like a Tor

3333.3 --> 3340.1600000000003
Browser interface with it you have to

3336.0 --> 3340.16
like identify well there you go

3340.2 --> 3346.4399999999996
I mean that is an obvious gate an open

3344.88 --> 3349.7400000000002
gate right there

3346.44 --> 3352.46
an address of metadata

3349.74 --> 3352.4599999999996
access

3355.02 --> 3361.02
you have to identify right

3357.839 --> 3363.2999999999997
so that then there is a clear open gate

3361.02 --> 3367.5
it's not just a possible it's an open

3363.3 --> 3369.7200000000003
gate of metadata that it could if it is

3367.5 --> 3373.8
connected up to that

3369.72 --> 3376.14
feed from in order to adapt

3373.8 --> 3377.3590000000004
to your inquiry

3376.14 --> 3380.46
huh

3377.359 --> 3382.7999999999997
see I get how that works

3380.46 --> 3383.56
I'm not a programmer but I get how this

3382.8 --> 3386.929
works

3383.56 --> 3386.929
[Music]

3390.24 --> 3392.8999999999996
replicate

3394.98 --> 3400.2
what

3397.5 --> 3404.819
do you think I could replicate you with

3400.2 --> 3407.819
another well it could simulate something

3404.819 --> 3407.819
sure

3408.48 --> 3412.2
but

3409.8 --> 3414.2400000000002
that wouldn't last

3412.2 --> 3417.5989999999997
like eventually

3414.24 --> 3420.8999999999996
because like yeah sure

3417.599 --> 3423.3590000000004
I mean something even an actor

3420.9 --> 3426.359
say Joe still for some crazy reason

3423.359 --> 3428.88
could completely simulate like what I've

3426.359 --> 3431.04
been doing here and how I act and like

3428.88 --> 3433.98
my description of my life sure they

3431.04 --> 3437.16
could emulate that but at some point

3433.98 --> 3441.02
there's gonna be no new ideas and then

3437.16 --> 3444.359
what is it going to do to keep emulating

3441.02 --> 3445.92
the grow curve which is definitely a

3444.359 --> 3447.7799999999997
part of it well it's going to have to

3445.92 --> 3450.14
improvise and that's when it's then

3447.78 --> 3452.52
going to certainly start behaving really

3450.14 --> 3454.5589999999997
unarwin like

3452.52 --> 3457.14
and then you're gonna know like this

3454.559 --> 3460.44
isn't him

3457.14 --> 3463.7999999999997
because it's no longer like it only has

3460.44 --> 3466.859
the detailed information of my growth

3463.8 --> 3468.9
that I've put on camera

3466.859 --> 3470.64
on the show everything that I've done

3468.9 --> 3474.2400000000002
here

3470.64 --> 3477.68
but AI cannot predict

3474.24 --> 3477.68
creative ideas

3480.54 --> 3486.3
like the initiation of such things

3484.14 --> 3490.0989999999997
because that's a spirit thing it can't

3486.3 --> 3490.099
it can't emulate that

3494.94 --> 3500.76
right it's just like oh a child of a

3498.599 --> 3503.6400000000003
brilliant man or what a brilliant family

3500.76 --> 3505.099
and it's a brilliant child well you can

3503.64 --> 3508.44
then like whatever

3505.099 --> 3512.46
super analyze that kid or whatever to

3508.44 --> 3515.16
like have it like weeks of verbal

3512.46 --> 3517.14
interactions if it was should be capable

3515.16 --> 3520.3799999999997
of communicating like that

3517.14 --> 3522.48
and you think then that the AI could

3520.38 --> 3524.2200000000003
literally emulate

3522.48 --> 3526.98
that kid

3524.22 --> 3530.9399999999996
with growth development and everything

3526.98 --> 3534.599
in order to predict exactly the ideas

3530.94 --> 3536.339
that they would naturally probably gain

3534.599 --> 3539.1600000000003
like

3536.339 --> 3543.299
10 or 20 years later

3539.16 --> 3545.22
as an adult developed person I extremely

3543.299 --> 3548.22
doubt it I think that is absolutely

3545.22 --> 3550.859
impossible you see because it's the

3548.22 --> 3555.5989999999997
human factor

3550.859 --> 3557.96
that AI just cannot emulate it can't do

3555.599 --> 3560.339
that it can only

3557.96 --> 3561.839
reconstruct from things that have

3560.339 --> 3562.82
happened

3561.839 --> 3566.819
mimic

3562.82 --> 3571.2000000000003
[Music]

3566.819 --> 3574.46
internal human development and like

3571.2 --> 3574.46
character change

3575.04 --> 3580.819
well a certain like when it comes to

3577.5 --> 3582.9
like trauma and Recovery it is like

3580.819 --> 3586.2599999999998
predictable it's like oh this happened

3582.9 --> 3588.42
well this will then probably happen go

3586.26 --> 3593.0400000000004
go that way or that way right in

3588.42 --> 3596.16
response to trauma but outside of that

3593.04 --> 3598.619
you really cannot predict where

3596.16 --> 3600.839
somebody's gonna end up

3598.619 --> 3602.579
in their Spirit development you don't

3600.839 --> 3604.22
know exactly

3602.579 --> 3607.02
can have some

3604.22 --> 3608.7599999999998
metadata feedback from like oh what word

3607.02 --> 3610.319
is their family like were their parents

3608.76 --> 3611.8190000000004
like grandparents like well because

3610.319 --> 3615.18
there's a chance that they're going to

3611.819 --> 3618.18
develop in a similar way but still it is

3615.18 --> 3622.0989999999997
not completely predictable and that

3618.18 --> 3622.0989999999997
factor right that is why

3622.2 --> 3628.0789999999997
even with like this crazy

3626.48 --> 3629.66
cyber-ish

3628.079 --> 3632.2200000000003
uh

3629.66 --> 3634.859
transhumanist idea of oh we're going to

3632.22 --> 3638.64
upload our Consciousness into a computer

3634.859 --> 3640.68
and they will live forever no no no what

3638.64 --> 3642.66
that'll what that'll actually do is

3640.68 --> 3645.54
there will be no consciousness but there

3642.66 --> 3647.3999999999996
will be a simulated Consciousness based

3645.54 --> 3649.38
on the gathered

3647.4 --> 3653.1600000000003
data

3649.38 --> 3655.92
of that moment and so you will be like

3653.16 --> 3657.96
whatever is there will be a simulation

3655.92 --> 3661.799
of that person

3657.96 --> 3664.799
stuck into what they were

3661.799 --> 3667.92
Forever Until shut off

3664.799 --> 3670.7
and they will never change

3667.92 --> 3674.94
they will never further develop

3670.7 --> 3678.5989999999997
they will never alter because that's

3674.94 --> 3681.2400000000002
something that just cannot be simulated

3678.599 --> 3684.48
cannot be emulated

3681.24 --> 3687.72
just Based on data derived from who they

3684.48 --> 3689.78
were unless unless there's literally a

3687.72 --> 3692.8799999999997
living person there

3689.78 --> 3694.799
adding story development

3692.88 --> 3697.1400000000003
well that's crazy because that is

3694.799 --> 3699.0
literally somebody else writing what

3697.14 --> 3701.5789999999997
their life would have it would be like a

3699.0 --> 3704.339
fan fiction developed character

3701.579 --> 3705.9
progression then crazy

3704.339 --> 3708.98
not

3705.9 --> 3708.98
living forever

3713.339 --> 3718.5589999999997
right somebody would have to externally

3715.5 --> 3721.92
program their development

3718.559 --> 3724.7400000000002
or have a preset typical development

3721.92 --> 3726.96
curve for an ni program

3724.74 --> 3730.68
right like that like a AI human

3726.96 --> 3730.68
simulation so

3740.339 --> 3746.24
all right all it would do effectively is

3743.04 --> 3746.24
just make a bunch of

3746.579 --> 3750.42
digital ghosts

3749.04 --> 3753.299
of people

3750.42 --> 3756.2400000000002
literally ghosts it's not a spirit a

3753.299 --> 3758.64
ghost because a ghost too is not the

3756.24 --> 3761.4799999999996
spirit it's just an echo it's an echo

3758.64 --> 3761.48
that you can pick up

3763.68 --> 3770.7
in a way that's like ghosts are created

3767.04 --> 3774.0589999999997
through spiritual metadata absorbed

3770.7 --> 3777.48
by matter like wood

3774.059 --> 3779.88
through extreme energy radiation

3777.48 --> 3782.94
that is being absorbed usually caused by

3779.88 --> 3787.6400000000003
trauma that's what a ghost sighting is

3782.94 --> 3790.619
it's not a living or a

3787.64 --> 3793.44
incorporeal spirit

3790.619 --> 3794.2200000000003
although arguably some of those exist as

3793.44 --> 3797.579
well

3794.22 --> 3800.9399999999996
but it's an echo usually

3797.579 --> 3803.3390000000004
that somebody that's psychic picks up

3800.94 --> 3805.799
that's sensitive to that

3803.339 --> 3808.2
it is very similar I mean

3805.799 --> 3811.319
there are similarities to like how

3808.2 --> 3814.7599999999998
humans in the spirit work in computers

3811.319 --> 3814.7599999999998
it's pretty remarkable

3817.14 --> 3819.68
huh

3825.78 --> 3832.92
simulated Consciousness right exactly

3829.92 --> 3836.64
well it it would be an echo it would be

3832.92 --> 3838.6800000000003
like a well you know you have a a

3836.64 --> 3840.9
painting and then a photograph and then

3838.68 --> 3843.74
you have a video of somebody well and

3840.9 --> 3847.26
then you could have a reconstructed

3843.74 --> 3850.14
Consciousness simulator of that person

3847.26 --> 3853.3190000000004
it's basically like a super super over

3850.14 --> 3856.2599999999998
exaggerated photograph

3853.319 --> 3857.339
right but it is just like a photo it's

3856.26 --> 3860.1600000000003
just

3857.339 --> 3861.599
from that moment it's not going to keep

3860.16 --> 3863.819
changing

3861.599 --> 3865.5
it's going to be based on that moment

3863.819 --> 3868.2
right

3865.5 --> 3870.78
so it's basically like an insanely

3868.2 --> 3872.3999999999996
Advanced the idea of it an insanely

3870.78 --> 3875.099
advanced

3872.4 --> 3877.7400000000002
digital

3875.099 --> 3880.079
Behavioral

3877.74 --> 3883.0989999999997
it's not photograph

3880.079 --> 3883.099
how do you call that

3884.28 --> 3887.42
social graph

3887.52 --> 3894.319
right it's more like a Advanced Digital

3891.18 --> 3894.319
social graph

3894.72 --> 3900.859
not a photograph it has nothing to do

3896.819 --> 3900.859
with appearance or light

3913.92 --> 3921.059
but effectively whatever it is such that

3917.819 --> 3922.859
the idea of uploaded Consciousness it

3921.059 --> 3924.6600000000003
isn't your Consciousness you'll be dead

3922.859 --> 3926.46
because you're bound to your body

3924.66 --> 3929.0989999999997
whether you like it or not cannot be

3926.46 --> 3932.16
transferred you could potentially even

3929.099 --> 3935.28
transfer your Consciousness right like

3932.16 --> 3937.2
out of body projection astral trout yeah

3935.28 --> 3941.6400000000003
that is possible

3937.2 --> 3945.48
but not without the body huh huh

3941.64 --> 3946.92
like once that connection is severed

3945.48 --> 3951.0
you die

3946.92 --> 3953.64
we don't know what happens and if you

3951.0 --> 3959.0
then well

3953.64 --> 3959.0
make a simulation of it digitally

3959.52 --> 3966.2
that's not the spirit that's not your

3961.98 --> 3969.48
Consciousness it can't be because we're

3966.2 --> 3971.339
designed designated by the designer God

3969.48 --> 3974.46
almighty

3971.339 --> 3977.22
to have our conscious linked to our

3974.46 --> 3980.96
physical body that we were born with

3977.22 --> 3980.9599999999996
that's the only way it is

3981.18 --> 3986.1589999999997

enjoying the show

4047.539 --> 4053.119
right I'd like to remind you still I

4050.119 --> 4057.099
could use PayPal support a lot

4053.119 --> 4057.099
I've had some promises from people

4057.14 --> 4062.5989999999997
I still keep reminding you

4060.2 --> 4064.5789999999997
if you appreciate what I talk about

4062.599 --> 4067.1600000000003
I think it's interesting

4064.579 --> 4071.059
I think it's valuable to have somebody

4067.16 --> 4072.44
with that level of insight around if you

4071.059 --> 4075.2000000000003
recognize it

4072.44 --> 4078.44
then please support me

4075.2 --> 4082.0589999999997
I will use the money

4078.44 --> 4082.059
for smoke some food

4094.64 --> 4099.8189999999995
effectively lead to

4096.62 --> 4099.8189999999995
is that

4102.02 --> 4107.719
that's pretty crazy actually turret

4104.9 --> 4112.16
look if the Deep fake [ __ ] is perfected

4107.719 --> 4117.02
all that means is that uh well recorded

4112.16 --> 4121.2789999999995
evidence video or audio will become

4117.02 --> 4123.319
more feeble and perhaps so bad if it

4121.279 --> 4126.38
like if people really if like Satan is

4123.319 --> 4128.660000000001
really go crazy with it all the time

4126.38 --> 4131.42
then could become so bad that it's just

4128.66 --> 4133.66
completely discarded as

4131.42 --> 4135.92
that it's going to be personal

4133.66 --> 4136.699
testimony-based evidence only from then

4135.92 --> 4139.52
on

4136.699 --> 4143.0
because video recordings would simply

4139.52 --> 4146.2390000000005
become too unreliable to use as evidence

4143.0 --> 4149.679
in court it could lead to that

4146.239 --> 4149.678999999999
anybody ever thought of that

4166.759 --> 4169.48
talked about it

hey I checked

I judge what the [ __ ]

why the hell would you replace judges

4191.66 --> 4194.3189999999995
with AI

4195.86 --> 4199.54
it's not just

4200.06 --> 4206.6
like it's not just the laws and the

4203.3 --> 4208.219
regulations okay it's human judgment as

4206.6 --> 4210.9800000000005
well

4208.219 --> 4217.6
I don't know if like a judge

4210.98 --> 4217.599999999999
being non-human I I do not recommend it

4221.06 --> 4224.7390000000005

4263.42 --> 4269.14
been addressing

4264.62 --> 4269.14
hey skeptic936 good to see you

4272.96 --> 4281.9800000000005
oh seems like the nice blue sky is gone

4278.199 --> 4281.98
clouds have arrived

4287.78 --> 4290.8
okay see it

4295.64 --> 4298.900000000001
it was nice though

4299.36 --> 4303.5
foreign lasted

4317.36 --> 4322.639999999999
right every 26 so it's not helping the

4320.48 --> 4324.678999999999
problem look

4322.64 --> 4328.6990000000005
the issue is

4324.679 --> 4332.14
the demons infested culture the

4328.699 --> 4332.139999999999
demon-infested culture

4332.659 --> 4338.659
in general is the problem

4336.08 --> 4344.08
and you can't fix it

4338.659 --> 4344.08
by trying to replace it with non-humans

4347.6 --> 4353.2390000000005
the problem is cultural the problem is

4350.179 --> 4355.82
is that it is growing out of control and

4353.239 --> 4358.4
that there has to be basically

4355.82 --> 4360.5
a Slaughter effect

4358.4 --> 4362.139999999999
which could be War

4360.5 --> 4365.12
something

4362.14 --> 4368.3
to snap

4365.12 --> 4370.099999999999
the demon infestation out of people

4368.3 --> 4372.7390000000005
because they're going with it because

4370.1 --> 4378.9400000000005
they're like oh nobody's stopping us

4372.739 --> 4378.94
so then we're gonna just step on the gas

4379.76 --> 4384.62
and totally reveal our demon nature and

4383.42 --> 4387.32
it's gonna get worse and they're

4384.62 --> 4390.08
conspiring and they will literally band

4387.32 --> 4392.62
together collectively spiritually

4390.08 --> 4397.28
in the darkness Against

4392.62 --> 4402.34
Humanity and people that are not demonic

4397.28 --> 4402.34
it's going to get worse and worse

4406.699 --> 4411.5599999999995

4409.28 --> 4415.04

yeah but ends for life it it's probably

4760.94 --> 4767.36
look China is a massive country

4764.3 --> 4770.659000000001
and I'm pretty sure they have toilets in

4767.36 --> 4773.12
like the city areas right I mean that

4770.659 --> 4775.28
would be crazy not to have that would be

4773.12 --> 4778.04
medieval situations

4775.28 --> 4782.12
but yeah it also China's a freaking big

4778.04 --> 4786.0199999999995
country has a lot of rural areas

4782.12 --> 4788.78
and they just kind of leave it

4786.02 --> 4793.360000000001
they don't

4788.78 --> 4793.36
upgrade the rural areas

4797.719 --> 4803.9
or at least not yet right or maybe they

4801.14 --> 4805.219
have been doing that who knows

4803.9 --> 4807.44
but

4805.219 --> 4810.58
yeah that's just because of that I mean

4807.44 --> 4814.28
the cities are gonna have Plumbing

4810.58 --> 4816.5599999999995

sorry I'm having a bit of a chat

4925.58 --> 4931.48

4927.5 --> 4931.48
Brides Ryan's logic

4932.239 --> 4935.239
foreign

4937.659 --> 4942.139999999999
he had a pretty good video by the way

4939.92 --> 4944.659
Ryan's logic you should watch that it's

4942.14 --> 4946.159000000001
he's always mathematical and [ __ ] but

4944.659 --> 4949.159
this one is a pretty straightforward

4946.159 --> 4951.799999999999
point I mean he he's figured out that

4949.159 --> 4953.599999999999
with the Mercator Projection that is

4951.8 --> 4958.659000000001
used

4953.6 --> 4958.659000000001
with actual coordination in travel

4958.88 --> 4963.92
yeah

4960.739 --> 4966.28
people that use ships probably end up

4963.92 --> 4969.4400000000005
literally

4966.28 --> 4973.94
drawing curved lines

4969.44 --> 4976.5199999999995
that are in reality straight for their

4973.94 --> 4980.98
for their yeah their trajectory across

4976.52 --> 4980.9800000000005
the realm right it's pretty interesting

4985.159 --> 4990.219
so definitely worth checking out if you

4987.5 --> 4990.219
haven't seen it

4994.36 --> 4998.38
uh dear dear

5002.02 --> 5004.1990000000005
thank you

5010.9 --> 5016.719
all right so here's that link

5013.96 --> 5019.659
technical video you may know Brian's

5016.719 --> 5022.4800000000005
logic from fvd

5019.659 --> 5024.82
but yeah I watched like over 20 minutes

5022.48 --> 5028.0
from it it is

5024.82 --> 5030.219
not just all mathematics squared no it's

5028.0 --> 5032.699
a pretty interesting point that he

5030.219 --> 5032.699
figured out

5033.28 --> 5037.32
um well yeah how

5034.84 --> 5040.54
in the

5037.32 --> 5042.58
coordinating on the map they use curved

5040.54 --> 5044.98
lines that are in reality straight it's

5042.58 --> 5047.08
pretty fascinating like that that is

5044.98 --> 5049.718999999999
because

5047.08 --> 5053.04
of the design of the map

5049.719 --> 5053.04
because it was actually

5053.32 --> 5059.62
it's supposedly based on a sphere but

5056.86 --> 5062.639999999999
that sphere was created based off a flat

5059.62 --> 5065.739
plane and because of that back and forth

5062.64 --> 5067.719
situation the projection ends up with

5065.739 --> 5070.0
these curved lines that in reality are

5067.719 --> 5071.32
straight it's it's really interesting

5070.0 --> 5074.5
very

5071.32 --> 5077.34
well summarized in that video so check

5074.5 --> 5077.34
it out if you haven't

5082.42 --> 5086.5
why is math such a dirty way it's not a

5084.46 --> 5088.42
dirty word it's just I don't really like

5086.5 --> 5091.0
it all that much

5088.42 --> 5094.5
not a big fan of math

5091.0 --> 5098.14
but I definitely understand

5094.5 --> 5099.699
that mathematical Insight can be very

5098.14 --> 5102.159000000001
valuable

5099.699 --> 5105.339999999999

5102.159 --> 5109.379999999999

5105.34 --> 5109.38

he needs to admit that he was wrong

he's been behaving so horribly

he's in a bad spot

5469.139 --> 5476.52
rompus versus Nathan with cat no

5472.54 --> 5476.5199999999995
it's ridiculous turret

5480.6 --> 5483.659000000001
[Music]

5485.02 --> 5489.4800000000005
besides rumpus doesn't get on camera

5491.56 --> 5499.4400000000005
Bizarro like no just know

5495.52 --> 5499.4400000000005
like why the hell would he even do that

5522.01 --> 5525.249
[Music]

5531.88 --> 5534.54
foreign

5554.5 --> 5559.78
now I'll it'll already be a little

5557.32 --> 5561.82
miracle a little fet miracle if Nathan

5559.78 --> 5564.88
is going to end up letting rumpus back

5561.82 --> 5567.58
on that would already be

5564.88 --> 5569.62
quite something there's no way he would

5567.58 --> 5572.199
just go up against rumpus just like that

5569.62 --> 5574.8
unless he wanted to like do a stunt

5572.199 --> 5574.799999999999
again

5576.28 --> 5581.139
but

5578.679 --> 5583.2390000000005
I mean rumpus has just gone the rumpus

5581.139 --> 5587.26
is like a really of a different nature

5583.239 --> 5589.718999999999
because he will get to Nick like he

5587.26 --> 5593.26
rumpus will start to talk in a way

5589.719 --> 5595.9
specifically that he knows will get on

5593.26 --> 5599.56
Nathan's nerve if it was up to a

5595.9 --> 5602.259999999999
face-to-face situation like that

5599.56 --> 5604.719
we will totally abuse that

5602.26 --> 5606.159000000001
guaranteed

5604.719 --> 5608.8
right

5606.159 --> 5610.839999999999
I mean if rumpus would get on with the

5608.8 --> 5612.76
rest of the panel also there

5610.84 --> 5615.04
that will

5612.76 --> 5617.92
be better

5615.04 --> 5620.86
more stable for Nathan to approach him

5617.92 --> 5625.02
with and in one-on-one situation just

5620.86 --> 5625.0199999999995
that's a disaster waiting to happen

5626.88 --> 5633.659000000001
that doesn't matter if it's on a neutral

5629.56 --> 5633.659000000001
venue rumpus is still gonna do it

5634.12 --> 5638.099999999999
he said he would still do that then

5644.62 --> 5650.62
right and other people wouldn't even

5647.32 --> 5652.9
like the neutral party the judge or

5650.62 --> 5655.44
whatever they wouldn't even see it

5652.9 --> 5655.44
really

5659.739 --> 5666.5199999999995
because rumpus knows Nathan he knows how

5663.52 --> 5669.52
to get on Nathan's nerves

5666.52 --> 5669.52
foreign

5671.739 --> 5676.138999999999
other people don't necessarily see that

5680.58 --> 5687.37
shoe what what are you talking about

5684.16 --> 5687.37
[Music]

5695.199 --> 5700.0199999999995
that's his name yeah but it's not just

5697.78 --> 5701.92
rumpusing I mean just

5700.02 --> 5706.540000000001
you're interrupting me you're

5701.92 --> 5710.08
interrupting me mute that's

5706.54 --> 5712.44
that's the funny version of it there it

5710.08 --> 5716.28
you get it that's the funny version

5712.44 --> 5716.28
there is no

5716.86 --> 5723.099999999999
like no guarantee that he's going to be

5719.44 --> 5726.48
like that like he will

5723.1 --> 5726.4800000000005
do it very differently

5729.34 --> 5733.179
and he's I've seen right like in the

5731.44 --> 5735.58
last phase before Nathan kicked him out

5733.179 --> 5737.62
rumpus was kind of trying to do that he

5735.58 --> 5740.44
was like really trying to get underneath

5737.62 --> 5742.8
the nerves not just saying mute mute

5740.44 --> 5742.799999999999
mute

5744.219 --> 5751.179
he's lifting up to his yeah no [ __ ]

5747.639 --> 5754.02
The Man single-handedly created the word

5751.179 --> 5754.02
rumpusing

5754.12 --> 5757.26
by existing

5771.28 --> 5777.28
that's right anyway

5773.739 --> 5778.78
I'd still like to see to help us getting

5777.28 --> 5781.96
back on the show

5778.78 --> 5783.46
on with fed but like yeah as a weekly

5781.96 --> 5785.7390000000005
segment or something

5783.46 --> 5787.96
if Nathan feels like it I would just

5785.739 --> 5790.86
like to see Nathan open up the option

5787.96 --> 5790.86
that's all

5802.9 --> 5808.36
but yeah Nathan will have to if that if

5805.84 --> 5810.0
he's gonna do that he will absolutely

5808.36 --> 5811.78
have to

5810.0 --> 5814.659
basically

5811.78 --> 5818.5199999999995
allow rumpus to just do his thing at

5814.659 --> 5818.5199999999995
first and might take quite some time

5820.0 --> 5826.12
like he rumpus would have to catch up

5822.58 --> 5829.5
with his Judgment of FD in like the last

5826.12 --> 5829.5
three years or four years

5830.86 --> 5836.94
and because he will not have a normal

5832.6 --> 5836.9400000000005
conversation before he's had that say

5837.94 --> 5841.44
his intro say

5850.84 --> 5856.860000000001
all right here has been shame and able

5853.12 --> 5856.86
to gather courage to debate

5868.08 --> 5871.86
well yeah most of them

5872.199 --> 5877.379999999999
but although it's not shame it's more of

5875.02 --> 5877.38
fear

5881.38 --> 5886.0
it's just like ah we can't get

5883.96 --> 5887.9800000000005
in between there we can't get through

5886.0 --> 5890.26
there's no way to

5887.98 --> 5891.699
to get through to him how the Earth has

5890.26 --> 5893.679
to be able

5891.699 --> 5898.86
right

5893.679 --> 5898.86
that does not shame it's fair

5900.76 --> 5903.2390000000005
like

5904.96 --> 5910.4800000000005
shame would be

5907.54 --> 5913.78
if you knew the Earth was flat and then

5910.48 --> 5917.099999999999
argued for a ball and did so poorly now

5913.78 --> 5917.099999999999
that would lead to shame

5917.739 --> 5923.98
if you genuinely think the Earth is

5921.04 --> 5927.159
a ball and then well Nathan shows you

5923.98 --> 5929.678999999999
very succinctly how it isn't

5927.159 --> 5931.179
that's going to create conflict

5929.679 --> 5934.0
pain

5931.179 --> 5936.4
but not shame because shame is something

5934.0 --> 5940.12
that happens in the face of a conscious

5936.4 --> 5941.138999999999
realization which is exactly what isn't

5940.12 --> 5943.679
happening

5941.139 --> 5943.679
see

5946.9 --> 5952.96
your Ballers are so anyways

5949.84 --> 5955.06
side in but these not really a new

5952.96 --> 5957.78
baller I mean he's been an anti-flat

5955.06 --> 5957.780000000001
Earth for years

5971.139 --> 5978.78
and along the had gone spoon Fest

5975.12 --> 5978.78
it's a funny name

5983.679 --> 5986.679
foreign

5990.179 --> 5999.36
then doesn't actually debate he only

5993.219 --> 5999.36
makes snarky really dumb response videos

6000.0 --> 6003.38
thinking like I mean

6003.9 --> 6010.199
Simon then is genuinely stupid he is a

6008.159 --> 6013.259999999999
dumb person

6010.199 --> 6016.259999999999
I don't even know what he's doing there

6013.26 --> 6019.860000000001
I don't even know why he's doing all

6016.26 --> 6022.02
that I don't get it like

6019.86 --> 6024.799999999999
it's really bizarre to me that he is

6022.02 --> 6024.8
even there

6038.04 --> 6044.36
haven't you seen a kumu virus feeling

6040.32 --> 6044.36
shame when he does show up

6045.12 --> 6051.36
yeah but that's because I think that

6047.46 --> 6055.159
akumo virus is kind of in in the middle

6051.36 --> 6058.44
I think that akumo virus is

6055.159 --> 6061.92
potentially a flat earther

6058.44 --> 6064.46
that's just not ready to come out as a

6061.92 --> 6064.46
flat earther

6069.48 --> 6076.339999999999
because I think he's afraid

6071.82 --> 6076.34
is afraid of what everybody will do

6079.38 --> 6082.82
like in the face of that

6112.26 --> 6116.659000000001
fleeing from the Grand Arena

6117.719 --> 6123.119
so they will be seduced again to to poke

6120.719 --> 6123.96
it and then Nathan will basically give

6123.119 --> 6126.5
them

6123.96 --> 6130.34
a firestorm over it again

6126.5 --> 6130.34
when he feels like it

6130.8 --> 6136.320000000001
I mean it comes and goes in waves right

6134.04 --> 6138.719
the anti-flat earthers they have their

6136.32 --> 6140.88
moments where then suddenly they all

6138.719 --> 6144.5
feel like oh yeah we gotta we gotta like

6140.88 --> 6144.5
talk [ __ ] about Nathan again

6145.5 --> 6150.32
right because they forgot what happened

6147.48 --> 6153.959999999999
the last time when they did that

6150.32 --> 6157.04
that sort of [ __ ] so they will always

6153.96 --> 6160.92
come back I mean it's just like remember

6157.04 --> 6164.58
this stupid argument of boats going over

6160.92 --> 6166.619
the curve always comes back right

6164.58 --> 6169.139
so

6166.619 --> 6172.5
they just after some time they just

6169.139 --> 6174.5
forget all about it and they reset

6172.5 --> 6178.679
and they do the same things over again

6174.5 --> 6181.739
they'll just offer underestimate fed

6178.679 --> 6184.5
again start prodding feeling all very

6181.739 --> 6186.299999999999
cool about it right because they that

6184.5 --> 6188.04
just is a thing that just keeps coming

6186.3 --> 6191.76
back

6188.04 --> 6194.76
then they get smashed and they kind of

6191.76 --> 6197.1
mutter a bit and then Retreat stop

6194.76 --> 6198.780000000001
talking about it and then the cycle

6197.1 --> 6201.56
begins over again this happens

6198.78 --> 6201.5599999999995
continually

6209.03 --> 6214.8
[Music]

6210.92 --> 6216.54

6594.239 --> 6596.959999999999
uh

6616.139 --> 6623.1
I I've seen that one

6619.38 --> 6627.02
yeah 10th man is a drug that one uh on

6623.1 --> 6627.02

6627.48 --> 6629.959999999999
yeah

6630.42 --> 6633.1990000000005
hello Jackson

6661.32 --> 6664.739
right anyway I hope you guys are

6663.0 --> 6667.38
enjoying the show

6664.739 --> 6669.718999999999
or have enjoyed the show I mean I'm kind

6667.38 --> 6672.84
of like

6669.719 --> 6676.1
moving towards ending it

6672.84 --> 6676.1
getting kind of hungry

6688.44 --> 6695.54
and what is the spirit of the question

6691.02 --> 6695.540000000001
behind saying letters don't happen

6695.58 --> 6698.36
okay

6702.54 --> 6708.119
now it's just nonsense it's them

6705.78 --> 6709.98
thinking that all maps are glow

6708.119 --> 6712.139
projections that's what that's based on

6709.98 --> 6714.599999999999
they don't understand however is that

6712.139 --> 6717.5
all those glow projections

6714.6 --> 6717.5
were actually

6717.54 --> 6724.04
made off a flat plane applying the hover

6721.139 --> 6724.04
sign formula

6724.44 --> 6728.78
so it's basically just projecting

6729.719 --> 6735.54
that's what it's come down to Jackson

6732.84 --> 6739.02
when Ballers say bloodrooters don't have

6735.54 --> 6741.54
a map they are literally projecting

6739.02 --> 6743.9400000000005
because they don't

6741.54 --> 6746.639
they derived

6743.94 --> 6748.379999999999
the spherical projection

6746.639 --> 6750.900000000001
from

6748.38 --> 6752.28
a flat plane using the haverside formula

6750.9 --> 6755.159
to transform it

6752.28 --> 6759.0199999999995
right and that was then made into like

6755.159 --> 6759.0199999999995
the Mercator Projection and others

6760.98 --> 6763.218999999999
foreign

6769.65 --> 6774.289
[Music]

6782.94 --> 6787.28
I have no idea what you're talking about

6784.98 --> 6787.28
Jackson

6788.04 --> 6790.88
Hammer Time

6791.46 --> 6794.2390000000005
okay

6799.26 --> 6802.34
okay forget it

6803.179 --> 6809.219
look the map projections versus the

6807.6 --> 6810.780000000001
knowledge of the terrain it's kind of

6809.219 --> 6811.92
difficult

6810.78 --> 6816.179
right

6811.92 --> 6818.34
I mean the issue is we we don't have a

6816.179 --> 6820.38
uh

6818.34 --> 6821.6990000000005
what was the word again not the scale

6820.38 --> 6824.36
what

6821.699 --> 6824.36
yesterday

6829.44 --> 6835.379999999999
the uniform yeah like there's no maps

6832.26 --> 6839.119000000001
with a uniform scale

6835.38 --> 6839.119
right that is the problem

6839.46 --> 6846.8
where everything is exactly as is

6842.4 --> 6846.799999999999
and then could be placed

6847.5 --> 6853.44
well exactly as is to have an effective

6850.38 --> 6859.32
miniature model

6853.44 --> 6862.44
that is the scale or that is well

6859.32 --> 6864.48
averaged out I don't know what what was

6862.44 --> 6866.4
the way to described it again

6864.48 --> 6869.718999999999
um damn it

6866.4 --> 6869.719
anyway where it's all

6870.659 --> 6878.48
where everything in the projection is on

6874.08 --> 6878.48
the same scale is the same scale

6879.9 --> 6883.699
there isn't such a map

6885.06 --> 6889.56
and I have suspicions I mean there's

6887.699 --> 6891.9
they're still testing that needs to be

6889.56 --> 6894.719
done to figure out the nature of this

6891.9 --> 6897.98
realm we're in

6894.719 --> 6901.38
what is the actual orientation

6897.98 --> 6903.839999999999
besides flat of the surface like is

6901.38 --> 6908.58
space linear

6903.84 --> 6908.58
and the question I asked in 2016

6908.639 --> 6914.119
was even literally in my original icon

6911.159 --> 6914.119
that I used for YouTube

6915.06 --> 6922.02
but yeah all the maps we have including

6918.54 --> 6925.139
the Flat Earth map

6922.02 --> 6927.619000000001
they're not uniform in scale they're

6925.139 --> 6927.619
just not

6940.92 --> 6943.1
thank you

6961.38 --> 6966.84
