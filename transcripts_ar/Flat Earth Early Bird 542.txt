68.83 --> 73.35
please also do support me for the paypal

71.35 --> 77.53
page 1 my GoFundMe the super chat and

73.35 --> 81.69999999999999
the membership system join button that

77.53 --> 93.31
would be much appreciated so weather

81.7 --> 95.619
today is absolutely amazing yeah it's

93.31 --> 97.259
really warm that's why I'm wearing the

95.619 --> 100.3
white shirt by the way

97.259 --> 105.899
the wind is also kind of warm it just

100.3 --> 112.119
feels very summer ish and you have

105.899 --> 113.5
because earlier there were well they

112.119 --> 118.119
look like chemtrails

113.5 --> 122.55
like pretty much so but very high up and

118.119 --> 122.55
and yeah they're leaving this weird

122.61 --> 128.44
little cloud pattern but if you look at

125.979 --> 131.2
it close you can see that it used then

128.44 --> 134.73
it's kind of a straight line so that's

131.2 --> 134.73
what it seemed to have turned into

135.61 --> 143.96
makes me wonder it's not the typical and

141.32 --> 148.54999999999998
trail pattern so maybe it was a contrail

143.96 --> 153.08
after all it's getting more puzzled

148.55 --> 156.17000000000002
about this sometimes like I keep track

153.08 --> 158.57000000000002
of this like every single day but it's

156.17 --> 161.89999999999998
almost like like the patterns have

158.57 --> 165.01999999999998
become different now I don't know maybe

161.9 --> 168.23000000000002
they've gone and started using other

165.02 --> 170.53
substances because it just seems

168.23 --> 170.53
different

173.05 --> 177.98000000000002
anyway oh yeah I had despite the white

176.06 --> 181.78
shirt I got tumeric coffee with me and

177.98 --> 186.17
I'm gonna be very careful with that

181.78 --> 192.76
green tea and extra bonus I got

186.17 --> 197.73999999999998
strawberries who looking forward to that

it's a really beautiful ones yeah

202.49 --> 214.85000000000002
but first let's see who is in chat that

209.2 --> 217.48
has devil donors seems like a troll del

214.85 --> 222.94

217.48 --> 228.41

264.14 --> 267.43
good to see you all Oh II have a

273.37 --> 283.97
right it's Monday so the weekend is

279.95 --> 288.71
finally over had a yeah in a turmoil

283.97 --> 290.78000000000003
during the weekend but not going to get

288.71 --> 293.27
into too much detail you know like too

290.78 --> 296.39
much our wind life detailed will get

293.27 --> 300.14
absolutely annoyingly boring I don't

296.39 --> 304.64
want to be like and Leslie blabbering

300.14 --> 309.22999999999996
woman but yeah went through some tough

304.64 --> 312.08
times but also acted really well I think

309.23 --> 316.43
in retrospect like I really took actions

312.08 --> 321.68
despite feeling really bad and it kind

316.43 --> 323.99
of worked and I also had a talk on over

321.68 --> 329.11
Skype just in chat with good servant yes

323.99 --> 332.78000000000003
they've got pretty intense and yeah

329.11 --> 334.31
that also helped because yeah when I was

332.78 --> 339.46999999999997
talking to him I really was

334.31 --> 342.17
I guess stuck into into like the dark

339.47 --> 343.82000000000005
world perspective in a way I was just

342.17 --> 346.13
trying to really put it down in detail

343.82 --> 349.09
yeah I've been engaging with a good

346.13 --> 351.98
servant in in the more heavy details

349.09 --> 354.36999999999995
that I don't like just putting out there

351.98 --> 358.48
I he must understand why after

354.37 --> 358.48
everything I've said pretty much and

359.89 --> 366.53
yeah it was weird because I can describe

364.55 --> 369.11
it a little first I was just really

366.53 --> 372.02
stuck in there I said all kinds of

369.11 --> 377.24
things basically laid down the panic in

372.02 --> 378.68
a way but I it was so convincing that

377.24 --> 381.23
it's just like no matter

378.68 --> 383.75
yeah it just I couldn't take it out of

381.23 --> 385.87
that context perspective I couldn't it

383.75 --> 389.0
was just not possible

385.87 --> 391.07
in a way but then afterward it kind of

389.0 --> 396.26
settled and then suddenly I calmed down

391.07 --> 398.24
and yeah other elements that were like

396.26 --> 401.68
completely hidden from my consciousness

398.24 --> 403.61
and memory would suddenly appear and

401.68 --> 405.5
provide enough

403.61 --> 407.75
perspective on the whole thing again and

405.5 --> 411.409
just snap it's like snapping out of a

407.75 --> 413.81
spell so yeah good servant babe yeah

411.409 --> 420.009
sort of witnessed that I know in

413.81 --> 425.259
one-on-one Chad I hope he recognize that

420.009 --> 425.259
it's really weird being me sometimes man

434.469 --> 446.15
yeah anyway but ya been taking care of

440.029 --> 451.129
certain things and yeah again also like

446.15 --> 458.12
cold up a friend that I kind of last

451.129 --> 460.55
time I spoke to her yeah we had a like a

458.12 --> 463.58
tough fall out over it by the way over

460.55 --> 467.569
the the globe cosmology versus Flat

463.58 --> 471.05
Earth yeah and problem was she was

467.569 --> 473.69
basically handing me typical textbook

471.05 --> 475.61
baller arguments and the belief of the

473.69 --> 478.389
flexibility of science and the whole

475.61 --> 482.089
works and the problem is is she's

478.389 --> 485.449
librarian and she's really detailed and

482.089 --> 487.43
all from a pure-hearted good believing

485.449 --> 490.779
perspective you know so she's like

487.43 --> 493.49
innocent in this but very refined and

490.779 --> 495.08
yeah at that time I was pretty stressed

493.49 --> 498.61
I didn't even want to go there and then

495.08 --> 500.839
when that happened I basically started

498.61 --> 503.47900000000004
responding as if I were basically

500.839 --> 507.069
talking to rumpus because of the

503.479 --> 510.08
intellect level it's like accidentally

507.069 --> 512.32
like a lot of hostility slept in and

510.08 --> 515.0889999999999
that's something that she cannot handle

512.32 --> 519.979
but it was like I was basically trying

515.089 --> 526.3100000000001
to defend yeah my my profession anyway

519.979 --> 528.62
and my my legacy just my thought my

526.31 --> 530.9899999999999
thought processes the relative density

528.62 --> 531.97
works everything that's all tied into

530.99 --> 535.639
that and

531.97 --> 539.869
overarching psychology works frameworks

535.639 --> 543.139
and yeah I couldn't I couldn't

539.869 --> 545.149
understand what was going on in time so

543.139 --> 548.119
yeah we kind of broke up over the phone

545.149 --> 550.009
this not relationship with I was just so

548.119 --> 553.0400000000001
pissed off I hang up and just started

550.009 --> 556.9590000000001
ignoring it and yeah she took that

553.04 --> 560.48
pretty hard so it was tough engaging I

556.959 --> 562.8689999999999
just stayed really calm but man she was

560.48 --> 565.399
much more pissed off than I expected so

562.869 --> 574.1890000000001
I had to wade through that for 10

565.399 --> 577.489
minutes but I'd handled it I handled it

574.189 --> 580.3689999999999
pretty proud of it like I I could have

577.489 --> 582.769
at that point I got so pissed off again

580.369 --> 584.48
it's like yeah I buried that and then it

582.769 --> 590.749
came right back up to full strength

584.48 --> 592.489
apparently from our side and I was

590.749 --> 594.589
almost tempted to say okay well then

592.489 --> 596.6600000000001
screw you I'll just never talk to you

594.589 --> 600.9490000000001
again and I'm so glad that I didn't do

596.66 --> 606.949
that it just goes to show that my

600.949 --> 610.0089999999999
emotions can definitely blind me despite

606.949 --> 615.9799999999999
my intellect like when it becomes really

610.009 --> 618.769
personal and yeah like online here I'm

615.98 --> 621.41
very well aware that so many people are

618.769 --> 626.749
just religious fanatics and nasty people

621.41 --> 628.999
not you guys of course that yeah like I

626.749 --> 631.8190000000001
can never be vulnerable in any kind of I

628.999 --> 634.73
can never let them close but this person

631.819 --> 637.8789999999999
we've been through quite a lot it's my

634.73 --> 644.5690000000001
basically my longest lasting friend at

637.879 --> 648.499
this point and yeah she did get close

644.569 --> 650.389
and she saved my my mind at times my

648.499 --> 655.16
soul in a way like when I was really

650.389 --> 657.379
desperate yeah she could help me out of

655.16 --> 659.509
it in a way because she was very soon

657.379 --> 663.3190000000001
because she's so smart and she also has

659.509 --> 664.12
like issues she's also in a way a broken

663.319 --> 677.269
person

664.12 --> 680.5600000000001
very smart no Aries 106 that only

677.269 --> 680.5600000000001
happened when I was young

688.66 --> 702.01
was he I don't even remember what he was

693.83 --> 702.01
a result is it

714.13 --> 720.22
Yeah right

716.77 --> 722.84
grasping the life raft right anyway but

720.22 --> 726.9200000000001
yeah so what solve pretty heavy stuff

722.84 --> 728.7800000000001
and at the same time I don't know it's

726.92 --> 732.56
weird I think I keep on watching this

728.78 --> 736.9599999999999
series The Good Witch and yeah it keeps

732.56 --> 742.13
being a bit tough but there are some

736.96 --> 747.98
fascinating like tricks I guess and then

742.13 --> 751.85
they're genuine that I'm picking up it's

747.98 --> 754.76
like because I'm being confronted but

751.85 --> 757.34
with watching these characters I'm being

754.76 --> 760.52
reminded of like yeah if you do it like

757.34 --> 766.0400000000001
this this is really a natural response

760.52 --> 768.61
and it also reveals to me like how much

766.04 --> 773.27
I have ego struggles in the face of

768.61 --> 779.41
these types of things like how

773.27 --> 782.78
incredibly opinionated I seem to be and

779.41 --> 784.91
yeah it's been an interesting learning

782.78 --> 786.9499999999999
experience and I think I may have picked

784.91 --> 793.54
up some good traits as it were that I

786.95 --> 795.98
might be able to integrate so yeah I

793.54 --> 797.42
don't know if anybody else has been

795.98 --> 799.25
watching that series you know maybe

797.42 --> 803.8
after like the first episode already

799.25 --> 808.72
sick of it I I don't think it's like a

803.8 --> 808.7199999999999
man's serie at all

813.3 --> 816.3
yeah

821.01 --> 833.16
okay a Robin or Guns of Navarone RFP

829.529 --> 833.16
George Sanford

846.09 --> 849.35
what are you guys up to

849.45 --> 857.19
yeah I've been not very tuned in

854.3 --> 863.37
yesterday mostly just watching that

857.19 --> 869.49
series and yeah pondering upon vision

863.37 --> 871.98
stuff because yeah certain things have

869.49 --> 877.3100000000001
cleared up even further explained this

871.98 --> 881.22
to God servant as well very unpleasant

877.31 --> 884.5699999999999
parts that I'm starting to gradually

881.22 --> 884.57
contextualize now

890.93 --> 895.3599999999999
but yeah for now moving on

904.44 --> 909.36
I'll bison by the way also very relief

907.23 --> 913.0500000000001
to report that the paypal of donations

909.36 --> 915.69
most of them seems to have come in so

913.05 --> 917.49
yeah I think I'm pretty much safe for

915.69 --> 919.9200000000001
the rest of the month and now wondering

917.49 --> 923.61
if yeah if I'm going to get that suppose

919.92 --> 926.0999999999999
at the vacation bonus this month or next

923.61 --> 930.15
month because as soon as I do I'm gonna

926.1 --> 935.25
get the air filter I really want that

930.15 --> 939.51
thing you know I've noticed that I I now

935.25 --> 946.34
have general symptoms of low-level hay

939.51 --> 949.38
fever and it's annoying as [ __ ] this is

946.34 --> 951.1800000000001
because because yeah the times that I

949.38 --> 953.24
had my air filter that just didn't

951.18 --> 953.2399999999999
happen

960.73 --> 965.279
so yeah kind of looking forward to that

965.79 --> 975.0699999999999
so guys you tell me what am I gonna talk

969.49 --> 978.97
about today any flattered situation

975.07 --> 983.19
anything happening of note worthiness or

978.97 --> 995.49
suggests the regular Ebola nonsense

983.19 --> 995.49
continuing on CS is programming

1021.79 --> 1032.699
Oh God I really love God a gym is that

1029.11 --> 1036.819
that's all that's left to talk about

1032.699 --> 1042.66
masks goody okay well I have a little

1036.819 --> 1046.12
small little story it's not much but

1042.66 --> 1050.02
yeah I went to a store before the show

1046.12 --> 1053.7399999999998
and yeah a girl was behind the counter

1050.02 --> 1056.83
and she always wore a mask and she

1053.74 --> 1058.69
stopped wearing it now she was almost a

1056.83 --> 1062.58
bit annoyed by it and started explaining

1058.69 --> 1064.8700000000001
I didn't wear that for myself where for

1062.58 --> 1067.78
customers that could be sickly or

1064.87 --> 1070.53
something so she yeah she's a really

1067.78 --> 1073.57
nice person you know she's not like a

1070.53 --> 1076.809
trollop with a mask or anything

1073.57 --> 1079.48
it's judgmental at all even though she

1076.809 --> 1083.29
was like very much

1079.48 --> 1089.25
yeah behind she was she's like a natural

1083.29 --> 1093.19
trust I guess natural trust in

1089.25 --> 1098.44
yeah well in in the government system up

1093.19 --> 1100.3300000000002
to a certain level and I guess that also

1098.44 --> 1103.63
something to do with it that she's not

1100.33 --> 1106.6599999999999
like a medical experts it's not very

1103.63 --> 1110.8600000000001
into that so she just doesn't really

1106.66 --> 1113.22
know for sure makes her nervous I guess

1110.86 --> 1114.4189999999999
I think I talked about that earlier but

1113.22 --> 1117.27
discontinued

1114.419 --> 1120.48
anyway she stopped wearing a mask I

1117.27 --> 1120.48
think that

1122.16 --> 1129.74
I think that like most of the situations

1125.13 --> 1129.74
here will also like end to June first

1130.58 --> 1135.87
but they're still hyping it a lot in in

1133.89 --> 1139.0800000000002
the media I've been watching a little

1135.87 --> 1142.6499999999999
bit of Dutch television too just to

1139.08 --> 1146.1299999999999
check out a few things or some halfway

1142.65 --> 1151.6200000000001
interesting programs sometimes it's this

1146.13 --> 1155.3000000000002
documentary about gossip about Japan

1151.62 --> 1160.02
like how many people are extremely

1155.3 --> 1162.51
isolated in Japan like naturally that

1160.02 --> 1165.6
that there's like a high percentage of

1162.51 --> 1169.46
virgins just population wise the water

1165.6 --> 1169.4599999999998
there was 25 percent or something

1169.52 --> 1174.03
that that are and they have like this

1172.44 --> 1176.6100000000001
phenomena where they become so

1174.03 --> 1178.56
incredibly solitary that they arrange

1176.61 --> 1181.28
their lives in a way that they literally

1178.56 --> 1184.44
never have to face another person

1181.28 --> 1187.6499999999999
physically it's crazy it but it was kind

1184.44 --> 1191.6100000000001
of fascinating to watch that I think

1187.65 --> 1198.47
I've like read into that before 20 years

1191.61 --> 1201.6
ago but now I could get more out of that

1198.47 --> 1205.8
like more information out of it it's

1201.6 --> 1207.99
really an odd situation and well how

1205.8 --> 1214.58
they explained it in the program was

1207.99 --> 1218.85
that it is basically due to luxury that

1214.58 --> 1223.32
yeah some of the Japanese considered

1218.85 --> 1225.87
that before there was like a lot of

1223.32 --> 1228.36
riches before Japan became a lot

1225.87 --> 1231.81
wealthier people just didn't have the

1228.36 --> 1233.52
luxury to find solitaire to have

1231.81 --> 1239.82
solitary moments even though they did

1233.52 --> 1241.95
have the need probably right and there

1239.82 --> 1244.83
were also weird other issues by the way

1241.95 --> 1249.3600000000001
is that especially certain older

1244.83 --> 1251.23
generations that have not lived like in

1249.36 --> 1253.299
luxury from youth

1251.23 --> 1256.09
they actually have the opposite effect

1253.299 --> 1259.059
like they get severely lonely it's

1256.09 --> 1262.799
really bizarre so there's like a giant

1259.059 --> 1265.389
generational gap at it where certain

1262.799 --> 1268.99
younger generations and that can go a

1265.389 --> 1271.6299999999999
like into 50 even or something like that

1268.99 --> 1273.58
that are like completely isolationist

1271.63 --> 1275.95
self isolationist natural has nothing to

1273.58 --> 1278.9189999999999
do with covet even they were like that

1275.95 --> 1282.76
all their lives but there's a lot of

1278.919 --> 1286.72
older people that they can't really get

1282.76 --> 1289.389
around properly have troubles and they

1286.72 --> 1291.73
apparently the jails in Japan are

1289.389 --> 1295.5
partially filled with elderly people

1291.73 --> 1298.179
that commit like petty crimes literally

1295.5 --> 1305.049
turning themselves over just to go to

1298.179 --> 1308.95
prison to yeah to get by that it's it

1305.049 --> 1311.25
was a weird program but it was a pretty

1308.95 --> 1313.21
interesting documentary and not

1311.25 --> 1315.179
politicized in any way was very

1313.21 --> 1319.299
analytical

1315.179 --> 1321.3090000000002
so yeah who could have foreseen right

1319.299 --> 1324.539
turning on the television and actually

1321.309 --> 1324.539
seeing something interesting

1349.549 --> 1358.74
capitalism not but he have it's more

1354.179 --> 1366.6490000000001
about the modernization like stepping

1358.74 --> 1369.8990000000001
away from the old ways not using like

1366.649 --> 1373.9699999999998
lots of conveniences and constructions

1369.899 --> 1377.039
and machinery and like yeah the super

1373.97 --> 1380.039
modernization idea you know because old

1377.039 --> 1385.049
Japan used to be like very old-fashioned

1380.039 --> 1391.02
traditionalists like minimalist with

1385.049 --> 1395.1299999999999
simple but refined tools that were even

1391.02 --> 1397.71
like part of the historical history like

1395.13 --> 1401.22
an incredible ancient history of Japan

1397.71 --> 1403.77
very unique to in my opinion and the

1401.22 --> 1408.1490000000001
modernization like kind of swept all the

1403.77 --> 1410.8799999999999
purpose of that away so it makes sense

1408.149 --> 1413.25
like Japan has been basically in a

1410.88 --> 1416.24
cultural spiritual void in a way and

1413.25 --> 1419.669
it's literally reflected itself in

1416.24 --> 1426.21
people just seeking pure isolation they

1419.669 --> 1432.75
just yeah they want to be like the only

1426.21 --> 1435.72
person in the world in a way but maybe

1432.75 --> 1438.02
not maybe it's it's slightly different I

1435.72 --> 1440.22
think it's also with just perpetual

1438.02 --> 1444.96
insecurities it's also social insecurity

1440.22 --> 1449.33
that builds up that day it is a lot of

1444.96 --> 1452.039
the times escapism and but if you escape

1449.33 --> 1454.289
long enough then you'll also become

1452.039 --> 1457.32
intolerant of the presence of others

1454.289 --> 1460.7
it's like an allergic reaction because

1457.32 --> 1460.7
you're so not used to it

1469.69 --> 1472.69
right

1486.04 --> 1492.42
I wouldn't go that far acaba

1518.48 --> 1521.48
okay

1526.39 --> 1540.3700000000001
okay Aries 106 yo with me I don't

1534.88 --> 1544.45
necessarily thrive in isolation but like

1540.37 --> 1547.7199999999998
that is offset like I do I can be very

1544.45 --> 1550.96
stable and functional in a limited

1547.72 --> 1554.83
isolation because I do need people I do

1550.96 --> 1558.55
need contact a lot not but not

1554.83 --> 1563.62
constantly but I do need it a lot over

1558.55 --> 1567.46
time the problem is is that yeah when I

1563.62 --> 1570.07
engage in engaging with people it can

1567.46 --> 1575.3500000000001
often overwhelming this has been the

1570.07 --> 1579.61
case most of my life and I have a huge

1575.35 --> 1580.6599999999999
identity problem for myself and that's

1579.61 --> 1586.7199999999998
always been like that

1580.66 --> 1590.19
that I don't really know like what I

1586.72 --> 1595.15
should do a lot of the times with people

1590.19 --> 1599.2
there's only a few types that I like get

1595.15 --> 1602.89
and then can kind of like show them like

1599.2 --> 1606.3700000000001
help nobody gets me here I don't really

1602.89 --> 1608.8600000000001
know how to conduct myself that's been a

1606.37 --> 1612.2199999999998
lot of the kid that's also kind of what

1608.86 --> 1615.28
appealed that's why the gothic scene was

1612.22 --> 1619.33
appealing to me also because it is for

1615.28 --> 1621.28
that that's what it seems to be aimed at

1619.33 --> 1624.8999999999999
at people that are just naturally don't

1621.28 --> 1629.62
fit in and I felt very much like that

1624.9 --> 1633.27
but it's not good to like go with that

1629.62 --> 1633.27
on the long run

1639.65 --> 1647.0700000000002
so yeah I've had periods where I loved

1643.95 --> 1649.679
hanging around with friends but after a

1647.07 --> 1652.5
while do get like sick of it a lot of

1649.679 --> 1655.289
the times or problem nowadays is that

1652.5 --> 1660.419
just a whole lot of people that just

1655.289 --> 1663.029
seem perfectly nice have just traits to

1660.419 --> 1666.029
them that everybody seems to find

1663.029 --> 1669.45
perfectly normal but that I just find

1666.029 --> 1672.87
absolutely atrocious that like really

1669.45 --> 1674.82
pisses me off almost like how a social

1672.87 --> 1678.1789999999999
justice warrior would be pissed off if

1674.82 --> 1682.62
you set certain types of word that are

1678.179 --> 1685.679
like in their nono list you know but

1682.62 --> 1689.52
it's not it's pretty much the opposite

1685.679 --> 1694.5800000000002
it's much more about just like righteous

1689.52 --> 1694.58
conduct that kind of thing

1697.01 --> 1706.58
manners and at the same time yeah I have

1704.21 --> 1713.95
weird manners issue myself man I have

1706.58 --> 1717.86
started noticing that like in my general

1713.95 --> 1721.94
outside world code of conduct a lot of

1717.86 --> 1726.4399999999998
the times I for some reason I can't say

1721.94 --> 1731.6000000000001
thank you it's weird like I did I can't

1726.44 --> 1737.54
place it like I am thankful but I can't

1731.6 --> 1740.29
say it it's like I skip it and I don't

1737.54 --> 1740.29
understand

1749.21 --> 1752.83
I don't know why that is

1757.83 --> 1763.83
maybe maybe it's because I don't like to

1760.71 --> 1766.8600000000001
say thank you for little things maybe I

1763.83 --> 1771.74
just really like to say it when I really

1766.86 --> 1779.6689999999999
feel extremely thankful maybe that is it

1771.74 --> 1783.83
like I don't take that word lightly when

1779.669 --> 1783.8300000000002
I say it does that make any sense

1823.21 --> 1828.49
okay by the way what

1832.559 --> 1836.879
stop pestering me

1842.23 --> 1850.54
you know what maybe I just put the word

1845.919 --> 1853.5400000000002
or diecuts consecutive letters p900 on

1850.54 --> 1856.87
the banned list so stupid ass trolls

1853.54 --> 1860.9189999999999
will just stop bothering me with that

1856.87 --> 1868.4799999999998
[ __ ] I'll do something with it when I

1860.919 --> 1873.7
[ __ ] feel like it okay get over it

1868.48 --> 1882.01
I don't owe anyone anything

1873.7 --> 1883.27
considering that I've already got pretty

1882.01 --> 1886.84
good moon shots

1883.27 --> 1888.91
you know like I watch that that the

1886.84 --> 1891.549
plain one again you know what I'll just

1888.91 --> 1897.01
freakin share it because I can it's my

1891.549 --> 1903.66
video let's do this I'm just gonna show

1897.01 --> 1903.66
you what I caught long ago

1906.77 --> 1909.77
see

1919.01 --> 1921.7
yep

1923.76 --> 1927.059
it's advertising

1929.13 --> 1940.15
yeah you know just enjoy what I got and

1936.03 --> 1945.3999999999999
hey if there's a moment where yeah where

1940.15 --> 1948.5500000000002
I will engage once again then I will but

1945.4 --> 1957.3000000000002
if you keep on pestering me about it I'm

1948.55 --> 1957.3
not it's just the way it's gonna be

1964.19 --> 1968.919
what hold on

1973.16 --> 1980.27
always am I gonna do this

1986.08 --> 1991.9299999999998
it's like every time that firefox window

1988.45 --> 1995.65
just drives me nuts such a hassle to

1991.93 --> 1999.1200000000001
work with it you know BS that is all

1995.65 --> 1999.1200000000001
right I got it there you go

2020.6 --> 2031.4599999999998
good evening mrs.

2024.059 --> 2036.239
Arwen look at that thought there's

2031.46 --> 2043.019
finally a patch of clear sky let's check

2036.239 --> 2047.07
out the moon in a proper way instead of

2043.019 --> 2052.98
that silly webcam all of the time so I'm

2047.07 --> 2055.5789999999997
gonna just try and try to do nothing

2052.98 --> 2055.579
with it Oh

2059.8 --> 2063.09
it's very sensitive

2072.98 --> 2075.97
earlier

2094.08 --> 2100.1
I think this is the max I can zoom in

2116.33 --> 2126.2799999999997
whoa that was an interesting bonus

2129.25 --> 2141.27
Wow we just thought that would happen I

2132.9 --> 2141.27
didn't come on camera

2244.2 --> 2249.839
it's pretty interesting looking and it

2247.349 --> 2256.5
really didn't move so this entire slide

2249.839 --> 2259.77
by just your just its own angular motion

2256.5 --> 2262.099
across the heaven the camera completely

2259.77 --> 2262.099
still

2264.509 --> 2268.41
there's a couple of clouds

2291.3 --> 2308.25
so anyway thought not bad for our first

2297.43 --> 2308.25
go see you in the early bird show

2321.019 --> 2327.7389999999996
yo we set out to design a stealthy

2323.819 --> 2327.739
liquidity thanks for the advertisement

2333.57 --> 2341.5800000000004
that's pretty good right so all these

2338.52 --> 2349.2599999999998
people keep on saying uh you've never

2341.58 --> 2351.48
used it before well yeah I have but

2349.26 --> 2353.3700000000003
after some point it's like okay I can

2351.48 --> 2355.79
have like a giant collection of

2353.37 --> 2365.8199999999997
thousands and thousands and thousands of

2355.79 --> 2370.37
these shots and then what you know yeah

2365.82 --> 2370.3700000000003
of course you can Ares 106

2384.369 --> 2391.7690000000002
oh oh we got some ballers I got some

2389.469 --> 2394.839
ballers too thick they can just

2391.769 --> 2396.519
ridiculous claims to remain flat

2394.839 --> 2401.799
earthers you mean like the housekeeping

2396.519 --> 2410.7889999999998
questions that absolutely destroy your

2401.799 --> 2410.7889999999998
globe model religion ready Brooker

2411.93 --> 2422.71
craters in the shadows oh so so what is

2414.729 --> 2426.489
your proof that is that you know when I

2422.71 --> 2430.539
look at the background of my early bird

2426.489 --> 2433.859
show that Adam seemed to find yeah I'm

2430.539 --> 2436.8390000000004
pretty sure I'm looking at grass there

2433.859 --> 2441.719
go go and past it and like tree branches

2436.839 --> 2444.46
right I'm pretty sure it's that except

2441.719 --> 2448.69
I'm also pretty sure I'm basically

2444.46 --> 2451.239
staring at a plastic screen with all

2448.69 --> 2453.609
kinds of crystals that are being powered

2451.239 --> 2455.71
to polarize in a certain way I'm pretty

2453.609 --> 2462.16
sure I'm actually looking at that and

2455.71 --> 2465.579
not at grass not at tree branches you

2462.16 --> 2469.509
see so yeah you can think of them as

2465.579 --> 2472.539
creators and shadows but you don't

2469.509 --> 2477.099
actually have that proof it's just that

2472.539 --> 2480.19
what you're seeing kind of makes this

2477.099 --> 2483.88
this jump in your mind that because it

2480.19 --> 2488.13
looks like that it must be that you have

2483.88 --> 2488.13
no evidence for that none

2494.23 --> 2505.079
unless you could show us actual real

2498.099 --> 2511.65
world one shot video of ya launching off

2505.079 --> 2516.4300000000003
the earth right in singular uncut shot

2511.65 --> 2519.64
singular uncut shot so maybe like one

2516.43 --> 2521.71
singular uncut shot that lasts for I

2519.64 --> 2524.8799999999997
don't know months I don't know I don't

2521.71 --> 2527.89
know how long it would take days months

2524.88 --> 2532.15
singular uncut video shot from the

2527.89 --> 2533.68
launch of earth no cutaway not a single

2532.15 --> 2535.4500000000003
one a if you want to do with multiple

2533.68 --> 2538.75
camera that's that's fine you do it like

2535.45 --> 2545.23
four cameras singular and cut non-stop

2538.75 --> 2548.64
shots uncut singular shots as long as it

2545.23 --> 2552.31
is necessary from the earth launch on

2548.64 --> 2556.75
into suppose it out of orbit towards the

2552.31 --> 2559.24
moon and then approaching the moon from

2556.75 --> 2561.22
a far distance where first it's just as

2559.24 --> 2562.9599999999996
big as on the earth and then you

2561.22 --> 2564.0
approach it becomes closer and closer

2562.96 --> 2571.63
and bigger and bigger

2564.0 --> 2575.44
singular uncut shot alright now that if

2571.63 --> 2581.069
you can provide me with that I don't

2575.44 --> 2584.7400000000002
know I might be more inclined to start

2581.069 --> 2590.2
presupposing that the moon may actually

2584.74 --> 2592.68
be a physical object in some way how

2590.2 --> 2592.68
about that

2593.16 --> 2606.39
Oh what did he do now don't time him out

2602.01 --> 2615.119
for that he's just squirting good

2606.39 --> 2617.7599999999998
servant this guy he says it's just a I

2615.119 --> 2622.069
think he's I don't know what he is I

2617.76 --> 2622.0690000000004
think it's just a regular baller Oh

2626.539 --> 2635.76
nobody cares what I think oh well that's

2629.16 --> 2638.91
fine well hey that's the case then yeah

2635.76 --> 2641.88
you definitely don't belong here because

2638.91 --> 2642.5
I don't want people that don't care what

2641.88 --> 2646.1600000000003
I think

2642.5 --> 2648.569
because yeah what's the point of that

2646.16 --> 2650.22
what's the point of just people like I

2648.569 --> 2653.4
don't like you I don't like you well

2650.22 --> 2657.0589999999997
then [ __ ] off then go to something you

2653.4 --> 2659.549
do like all right unless you have some

2657.059 --> 2661.23
kind of a personal problem with the

2659.549 --> 2664.5
things that I'm saying because you can't

2661.23 --> 2668.46
let it go because I can't say what I

2664.5 --> 2671.73
think but everyone else in the world can

2668.46 --> 2673.619
right everyone else in the world can as

2671.73 --> 2675.51
long as it's not about this specific

2673.619 --> 2679.559
subject that you are absolutely

2675.51 --> 2681.869
intolerant off for no apparent reason

2679.559 --> 2685.529
because there's a lot of people out

2681.869 --> 2687.299
there that yet may not believe in Flat

2685.529 --> 2691.319
Earth that still believe pretty weird

2687.299 --> 2694.619
things like things that might even worry

2691.319 --> 2697.2599999999998
some people you know but yeah I don't

2694.619 --> 2699.619
see you trolling those people all day

2697.26 --> 2702.44
long why is that

2699.619 --> 2704.94
because yeah these people could be

2702.44 --> 2708.27
considered delusional maybe in some way

2704.94 --> 2711.4500000000003
like bit weird and cultish leaving in

2708.27 --> 2713.25
there things that sound crazy right you

2711.45 --> 2718.859
don't go and bother them all day long do

2713.25 --> 2720.93
you so why do you do it with me we would

2718.859 --> 2722.67
with flatter the woods like if it's so

2720.93 --> 2726.02
ridiculous then what's the problem

2722.67 --> 2730.4300000000003
what's the problem baller

2726.02 --> 2730.43
why do you keep coming back every day

2732.86 --> 2738.8
why are you acting so obsessively over

2736.62 --> 2738.7999999999997
this

2743.93 --> 2749.1499999999996
hmm oh that's good

2764.16 --> 2767.8199999999997
thank you yeah

2770.21 --> 2780.23
you come back because you had you have

2772.58 --> 2786.589
my personality Thank You Aries 106 right

2780.23 --> 2788.599
well look in a way I don't mind if you

2786.589 --> 2791.32
kind of want to hold on to the ball in

2788.599 --> 2794.48
the sense that you just have this

2791.32 --> 2796.73
nagging sense that you can't let it go

2794.48 --> 2798.7400000000002
that there might be a chance for it

2796.73 --> 2802.16
after all but it's gonna be much more

2798.74 --> 2806.66
remote because I had that a very long

2802.16 --> 2810.6499999999996
time in a way I'm still wondering you

2806.66 --> 2812.96
know I still sometimes wonder like yeah

2810.65 --> 2815.27
I have with the information I have so

2812.96 --> 2818.18
far I am pretty sure I'm becoming pretty

2815.27 --> 2820.099
certain about the holographic concept

2818.18 --> 2825.74
that is really just all lights because

2820.099 --> 2829.78
all the evidence points at it but has Oh

2825.74 --> 2833.0299999999997
has sufficient evidence reached me and

2829.78 --> 2836.21
with that I don't mean stupid just so

2833.03 --> 2839.0890000000004
stories with more model 3d nonsense and

2836.21 --> 2841.64
bla bla bla bla that that's not

2839.089 --> 2844.07
information no actual technicals actual

2841.64 --> 2848.359
direct evidence taken from a very

2844.07 --> 2850.82
serious neutral perspective that's not

2848.359 --> 2853.13
just trying to manipulate their audience

2850.82 --> 2857.4500000000003
to believe in a certain way no I want

2853.13 --> 2861.4300000000003
the raw the Ross I want basically people

2857.45 --> 2863.7799999999997
showing me things and not really

2861.43 --> 2866.39
understanding even what it is that they

2863.78 --> 2869.119
got but that they have read that it is

2866.39 --> 2871.2799999999997
registered data that's really the the

2869.119 --> 2873.44
more reliable source and it's just

2871.28 --> 2875.8390000000004
people that are just gathering data and

2873.44 --> 2881.06
they may not even fully understand what

2875.839 --> 2884.45
they have so yeah where is this approach

2881.06 --> 2887.74
I want to see some kind of sign of an

2884.45 --> 2894.6499999999996
approach of the moon and I want this

2887.74 --> 2897.47
weird phenomena of the apparent moon

2894.65 --> 2901.9100000000003
size growing in a seasonal transition

2897.47 --> 2903.8999999999996
moment I want that to be also explained

2901.91 --> 2906.66
without just blah blah blah

2903.9 --> 2909.1800000000003
our stories is just an illusion blah or

2906.66 --> 2911.91
whatever that's given from the baller

2909.18 --> 2921.569
side no it has to be actually

2911.91 --> 2924.27
technically sound in every way right but

2921.569 --> 2929.4
yeah if I'm right and it is all

2924.27 --> 2933.059
holographic then it's like I'm feel

2929.4 --> 2938.819
forced to somehow in some way figure out

2933.059 --> 2941.849
eventually how that works how does this

2938.819 --> 2949.64
light effect of the globe of the heavens

2941.849 --> 2952.619
work how does that function mechanically

2949.64 --> 2954.96
not just the cyclical patterns but just

2952.619 --> 2957.599
actually the manic mechanics of the

2954.96 --> 2964.98
manifestation of lights in that specific

2957.599 --> 2967.13
way why does the light manifest with the

2964.98 --> 2972.68
whole pattern as it is of that

2967.13 --> 2972.6800000000003
persistent heavens pattern

2976.829 --> 2979.549
hmm

2994.73 --> 3004.66
well Guns of Navarone rmp you know what

2998.27 --> 3009.46
with most ballers you can't really

3004.66 --> 3011.2599999999998
convince them you can only like

3009.46 --> 3017.05
carefully hand them the right

3011.26 --> 3018.7900000000004
information and hope that it will buy

3017.05 --> 3023.3100000000004
the information not by the way you

3018.79 --> 3026.619
present it even by your what drives you

3023.31 --> 3028.57
but just like literally giving that

3026.619 --> 3032.4100000000003
people an honest look at data without

3028.57 --> 3036.21
any opinionation should probably allow

3032.41 --> 3040.5099999999998
the triggering of like the release of

3036.21 --> 3043.69
the spell of the ball it should happen

3040.51 --> 3045.6090000000004
better because a way yeah what keeps the

3043.69 --> 3047.859
ball in place is social pressure

3045.609 --> 3051.3289999999997
remember that's the way how like the

3047.859 --> 3054.22
original conditioning trauma has entered

3051.329 --> 3057.13
it through social influence so if you

3054.22 --> 3060.069
have some kind of social influence when

3057.13 --> 3063.819
you try to convey your information that

3060.069 --> 3066.49
social influence may actually reinforce

3063.819 --> 3069.609
their defense mechanism to keep it in

3066.49 --> 3070.4799999999996
place you see it's very important to

3069.609 --> 3073.54
realize this

3070.48 --> 3076.26
it's also why explain many times when I

3073.54 --> 3080.079
really try to break flatter to people I

3076.26 --> 3083.2000000000003
never get aggressive I always take it

3080.079 --> 3085.51
very slow step by step to figure out

3083.2 --> 3086.8289999999997
like where are is there my net whereas

3085.51 --> 3088.6600000000003
they're hard at can they handle

3086.829 --> 3091.0600000000004
something like this because it is pretty

3088.66 --> 3093.359
heavy in the in the setting of all

3091.06 --> 3093.359
things

3098.02 --> 3101.38
all righty

3108.3 --> 3114.6800000000003
what are you guys talking about

3122.45 --> 3128.31
humans can't understand earthly things

3124.86 --> 3132.03
so we have fat chance of understanding

3128.31 --> 3134.34
heavenly things that depends on what you

3132.03 --> 3138.05
mean with heavenly things red priestly

3134.34 --> 3140.55
when I talk about the heavens in a

3138.05 --> 3142.6200000000003
cosmic gonna call sense when I talk

3140.55 --> 3145.34
about like earth orientation and

3142.62 --> 3147.54
phenomena physical phenomena like lights

3145.34 --> 3151.3500000000004
when I talk about the heavens I'm

3147.54 --> 3154.95
actually not talking about a like the

3151.35 --> 3158.88
spiritual essence and potential other

3154.95 --> 3161.31
dimensional things like the God and

3158.88 --> 3164.52
angels and heaven not that heaven I'm

3161.31 --> 3167.07
not talking about the final resort for

3164.52 --> 3170.64
souls as it were I'm talking about the

3167.07 --> 3174.06
celestial lights which I have kind of

3170.64 --> 3177.56
called the globe of the heavens because

3174.06 --> 3180.0
that yeah it that is also the heavens

3177.56 --> 3182.66
traditionally the word for that it's

3180.0 --> 3182.66
what is above us

3185.51 --> 3195.5400000000004
all right good servant that's okay then

3191.79 --> 3197.69
be careful with the caps anyway yeah it

3195.54 --> 3206.58
wasn't a good was it a good one

3197.69 --> 3210.83
the show Tom Parker anyway I'll probably

3206.58 --> 3210.83
take a look a little later after debates

3216.05 --> 3222.15
so yeah if you haven't checked out good

3218.46 --> 3224.73
servants channel do take a look yeah

3222.15 --> 3228.02
they're the good servant and Tom Parker

3224.73 --> 3231.54
have like just a lot of back and forth

3228.02 --> 3234.42
conversations but a wide variety of

3231.54 --> 3238.89
subjects also abdellah into like

3234.42 --> 3243.33
personal psychological issues kind of

3238.89 --> 3247.6189999999997
like you in a way what I do and yeah in

3243.33 --> 3250.56
in their own way and it's yeah I find it

3247.619 --> 3252.859
interesting as sometimes or rather a lot

3250.56 --> 3255.9
of the times I don't know it depends on

3252.859 --> 3257.58
yeah only on the mood there and of

3255.9 --> 3259.349
course but that's the same goes for me

3257.58 --> 3261.15
you know certain sometimes when I'm in a

3259.349 --> 3263.15
certain mood I don't want to see that

3261.15 --> 3266.849
[ __ ] again

3263.15 --> 3270.589
that's me it's whatever you're seeing it

3266.849 --> 3270.589
for whatever you're looking for I guess

3272.51 --> 3280.4100000000003
is your video on your playlist playing

3276.63 --> 3283.17
footage was awesome yes it is yes it's

3280.41 --> 3285.18
in my moon gazing playlist and the weird

3283.17 --> 3288.81
thing is it wasn't in there

3285.18 --> 3290.339
I I don't know but somehow it wasn't in

3288.81 --> 3295.339
the playlist I don't know how that

3290.339 --> 3295.339
happened it's like one of my best shots

3302.859 --> 3309.15
I'm too good for this world out come on

3305.079 --> 3312.779
Hammond don't be ridiculous

3309.15 --> 3312.779
you have no idea

3336.47 --> 3339.2799999999997
what

3346.63 --> 3352.289
alright yeah that that's right almost

3349.119 --> 3356.4100000000003
forgot forget to mention it

3352.289 --> 3363.119
yeah good servant is a pretty fervent

3356.41 --> 3368.2889999999998
Christian so yeah and it he yeah he

3363.119 --> 3371.259
references Christ a lot it's something

3368.289 --> 3376.029
that yeah I don't do that a lot myself I

3371.259 --> 3379.63
I constantly try to keep building rather

3376.029 --> 3382.69
I try to uphold the Spirit of Christ and

3379.63 --> 3387.339
the method as much that is my main focus

3382.69 --> 3391.7490000000003
in my Christianity I guess and not speak

3387.339 --> 3393.549
so much of it I guess maybe a lot some

3391.749 --> 3396.729
Christians out there think that likewise

3393.549 --> 3399.13
or we know we call himself a Christ when

3396.729 --> 3402.8799999999997
he yeah doesn't even read the Bible

3399.13 --> 3405.94
daily because I don't I'm gonna be fair

3402.88 --> 3409.6600000000003
about it but I know I will continue it

3405.94 --> 3412.42
it's just that I'm so intuitive with

3409.66 --> 3416.71
these things and it's like finding the

3412.42 --> 3418.4790000000003
right moment and then it works it

3416.71 --> 3420.279
obsessed by the rapture if yeah yeah II

3418.479 --> 3422.95
have I know I know what you mean but

3420.279 --> 3425.259
this I think this also is a reflection

3422.95 --> 3427.839
of personal struggles that good servant

3425.259 --> 3430.779
deals with because good servant has been

3427.839 --> 3435.749
through through some rough things

3430.779 --> 3435.749
himself you know

3438.18 --> 3445.2
the guy's experienced a lot of life pain

3441.27 --> 3449.819
Lee Laban Schmitz as they call it kind

3445.2 --> 3455.609
of like me maybe even worse i I can't

3449.819 --> 3462.359
size it up properly and and that is how

3455.609 --> 3464.97
he deals with it but I've been trying to

3462.359 --> 3466.92
tell him like dude like calm down with

3464.97 --> 3468.5099999999998
the whole rapture thing calm down with

3466.92 --> 3473.099
the end of the world because it's like a

3468.51 --> 3474.869
sign you're trying to that yeah you

3473.099 --> 3484.069
don't want to be in the hair and then

3474.869 --> 3486.21
now you know it's a sign of

3484.069 --> 3489.27
dissatisfaction when you become obsessed

3486.21 --> 3491.88
with the end as it were even if that and

3489.27 --> 3496.559
is going to bring a good promise of

3491.88 --> 3501.1800000000003
better or even maybe even more it just

3496.559 --> 3505.6800000000003
means that you have trouble handling and

3501.18 --> 3508.049
what's happening and I have a lot of

3505.68 --> 3511.589
trouble handling things that are

3508.049 --> 3514.14
happening or seem to happen but instead

3511.589 --> 3523.02
of just hoping the end will come

3514.14 --> 3528.779
I'm just doing my best like improve

3523.02 --> 3533.339
myself I guess bring it on baby it's

3528.779 --> 3536.369
like no that's how do you call it's like

3533.339 --> 3539.4
if you get too distracted then like you

3536.369 --> 3542.7000000000003
you'll miss out on life like there's

3539.4 --> 3546.569
more potential and in a way I think it

3542.7 --> 3550.6189999999997
is it is part of the path of crisis like

3546.569 --> 3553.71
don't waste on the fear don't waste your

3550.619 --> 3554.73
life because you fear things that might

3553.71 --> 3557.64
be in the future

3554.73 --> 3562.17
if that pacifies you then yeah you've

3557.64 --> 3566.5989999999997
not manifested because oh yeah things

3562.17 --> 3566.599
have haunted me very very badly

3568.93 --> 3575.06
but yeah what is it effectively done

3571.46 --> 3577.579
held me back kept me stuck in on a

3575.06 --> 3580.359
certain level even though I kept

3577.579 --> 3589.19
developing in other directions

3580.359 --> 3593.45
but yeah that is what that does and I've

3589.19 --> 3596.869
started to classify it under the savanna

3593.45 --> 3599.27
syndrome if you get obsessed with the

3596.869 --> 3602.54
end or with some extremities and that's

3599.27 --> 3605.96
constantly on your mind then that takes

3602.54 --> 3610.43
away from any productive engagement that

3605.96 --> 3616.329
you can work on in your life instead it

3610.43 --> 3616.3289999999997
sounds extremely simple and it really is

3641.8 --> 3644.46
hmm
