it's not very sunny seems to be like a

125.579 --> 127.88
foreign

128.84 --> 135.9
grayish soup up there

132.72 --> 138.0
like above the clouds like we can still

135.9 --> 140.28
see here

138.0 --> 144.92
but it's still really it's kind of warm

140.28 --> 144.92
like I don't need my heater on at all

145.5 --> 148.16
so

148.68 --> 151.28

hello evil nightmare first in chat

164.819 --> 172.26
to see you

166.379 --> 172.26
it is Friday the 17th of March 2023

175.94 --> 181.019
temperature 16 degrees right

182.64 --> 189.98
it says rainy but

185.7 --> 189.98
yeah I'm not noticing that at all

191.22 --> 196.64
all right

192.56 --> 196.64000000000001
someone's even coming through a bit

198.42 --> 203.54
partially though through the white Haze

204.06 --> 206.72
all right

211.62 --> 217.58
Okay so

214.379 --> 217.57999999999998
yeah for today's show

217.62 --> 222.92000000000002
did not have anything specific in mind

224.159 --> 226.7
foreign

246.42 --> 250.33999999999997
right so yeah we can talk about whatever

256.62 --> 259.799
oh yeah yesterday

258.06 --> 262.5
was kind of fun

259.799 --> 264.29999999999995
because by happenstance I didn't even

262.5 --> 265.919
know that wasn't that was a possibility

264.3 --> 267.72
really

265.919 --> 271.5
but

267.72 --> 274.62
I went on on authorized.tv

271.5 --> 277.259
and I actually noticed that there was a

274.62 --> 280.02
live stream going on

277.259 --> 283.38
so I actually managed to watch own

280.02 --> 286.44
Benjamin life through that website

283.38 --> 289.259
and there was like a chat there even

286.44 --> 291.3
but yeah it was remote I wasn't sure if

289.259 --> 292.32
anybody was actually looking at that

291.3 --> 296.16
chat

292.32 --> 299.46
but I mean yeah it was fun though

296.16 --> 303.36
somebody in there even recognized me

299.46 --> 306.38
like hey are you the Arwin from YouTube

303.36 --> 306.38
that was pretty cool

308.699 --> 313.199
but yeah

310.1 --> 315.90000000000003
that seems like fun and

313.199 --> 318.6
gonna try to catch that live more often

315.9 --> 321.73999999999995
it's around uh it was it started around

318.6 --> 321.74
eight o'clock I think

322.86 --> 327.18
my time it's probably because of the

325.38 --> 329.46
time shift I bet that on average he

327.18 --> 331.699
typically starts at 9 00 PM Amsterdam

329.46 --> 331.69899999999996
time

332.039 --> 337.58
that is a very popular hour in General

334.34 --> 337.58
on the internet

338.94 --> 344.3
getting recognized is fun yeah it is

357.96 --> 362.69899999999996
and it was a pretty fun live chat to be

360.9 --> 366.35999999999996
at

362.699 --> 369.62
it's no trolling there or or anything

366.36 --> 369.62
so yeah it was pretty cool

392.759 --> 396.5
hey Richard G good to see you

398.699 --> 404.40000000000003
that you miss on Benjamin streams on

401.1 --> 407.28000000000003
YouTube because of how convenient it is

404.4 --> 409.02
dude I haven't watched Owen Benjamin on

407.28 --> 411.35999999999996
YouTube like since

409.02 --> 414.06
well like the first month that I got to

411.36 --> 416.819
know about him and then he yeah he got

414.06 --> 421.88
kicked off and all that

416.819 --> 421.88
and then it was on D live for a while

425.22 --> 429.12
but he got kicked off that too at some

427.62 --> 431.419
point

429.12 --> 431.419
foreign

431.699 --> 439.91900000000004
I think he still has like people that

435.12 --> 442.62
just make YouTube accounts for him

439.919 --> 444.78
not sure like but sometimes like ew

442.62 --> 447.479
Dairy and Terry Channel or something on

444.78 --> 449.81899999999996
YouTube where he then live streams

447.479 --> 451.199
but usually those don't last very long

449.819 --> 454.46000000000004
like

451.199 --> 454.46000000000004
a few weeks or so

461.4 --> 463.63899999999995
foreign

474.139 --> 479.94
but yesterday's show when I was there it

477.84 --> 481.56
was like really themed of The Truman

479.94 --> 483.71999999999997
Show

481.56 --> 485.4
I mean it was really uh it was a very

483.72 --> 488.22
interesting stream to me

485.4 --> 490.75899999999996
it's fun being there and being able to

488.22 --> 493.259
live comment in the chat

490.759 --> 495.06
I'm about The Truman Show and I was

493.259 --> 497.3
thinking

495.06 --> 501.199
little word play

497.3 --> 501.199
the true manatee

509.94 --> 517.23
yeah now I actually remember that I was

514.26 --> 520.269
going to call this show that

517.23 --> 520.269
[Music]

526.02 --> 532.459
and I'm doing that right now

529.08 --> 532.4590000000001
almost forgot about it

532.86 --> 540.5600000000001
all right the true manatee

536.88 --> 540.56
hello Gemini Luna

542.36 --> 549.5
Jim has an actor is cool yeah yeah

545.399 --> 549.5
no I'm a fan of Jim Carrey

554.88 --> 559.56
he was like one of the first people that

557.16 --> 561.6
I bumped into that really like put that

559.56 --> 563.2199999999999
type of mania

561.6 --> 566.339
on camera

563.22 --> 568.32
because I always had when especially

566.339 --> 570.36
when I was younger I had like traits of

568.32 --> 573.12
like how we acted

570.36 --> 577.22
and like

573.12 --> 580.019
it was very popular even to like mimic

577.22 --> 582.5
mannerisms of him like from Ace Ventura

580.019 --> 582.5
and [ __ ]

591.6 --> 595.8000000000001
but yeah Jim really has that Mania

594.0 --> 597.24
streak to him especially in his early

595.8 --> 600.54
work

597.24 --> 602.22
and yeah at the time it might have been

600.54 --> 605.399
like oh he's so disruptive he's

602.22 --> 607.14
distorting his cultural disappears like

605.399 --> 611.36
putting everything out of whack but it

607.14 --> 611.36
is he is really freaking funny though

612.0 --> 615.66
serious roles are great yeah well he can

614.279 --> 618.899
mix it up

615.66 --> 620.9399999999999
from really silly to very serious

618.899 --> 623.24
like the cable guy was one of those

620.94 --> 623.24
movies

623.399 --> 627.24
so yeah he's just a

625.44 --> 630.32
intense

627.24 --> 630.32
good actor

633.54 --> 636.54
so

637.5 --> 642.5
and The Truman Show in general wasn't

639.54 --> 642.5
just a very good movie

650.16 --> 654.959
Eternal shine of the Spotless Mind what

653.459 --> 657.779
I

654.959 --> 661.2199999999999
was that a Jim Carrey movie

657.779 --> 661.22
I don't think I've heard of that

667.5 --> 678.44
[Music]

675.12 --> 682.44
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

678.44 --> 682.44
2004. huh

687.899 --> 693.38
I don't know why but I've never even

690.54 --> 693.38
heard of this movie

694.32 --> 697.32
foreign

706.82 --> 710.5400000000001
I should check that out

718.44 --> 724.5600000000001
let's see if they have that on Netflix

722.16 --> 726.56
thanks for the tip

724.56 --> 731.3
foreign

726.56 --> 731.3
buggy LSG good to see you

743.579 --> 749.04
dude

745.019 --> 751.98
what the [ __ ] is this man I I

749.04 --> 754.62
specifically put it on mute

751.98 --> 757.5
then I switched page and it unmuted it

754.62 --> 761.88
what the [ __ ] is this

757.5 --> 766.94
this is not proper functioning

761.88 --> 766.9399999999999
uh okay now Netflix doesn't have it

769.8 --> 775.68
you'll have to look it up on

773.1 --> 777.9200000000001
through Pirate Bay I mean it's an old

775.68 --> 777.92
movie

778.56 --> 785.2199999999999
it's no reason

781.079 --> 785.2199999999999
for it to be unfindable

799.32 --> 804.019
all right oh that's pretty popular

810.6 --> 813.98
all right I'll check that out

832.8 --> 837.0
nice all right cool I have something to

835.68 --> 840.1389999999999
watch

837.0 --> 840.139
later today

865.38 --> 869.0
he's retired from acting

869.399 --> 875.36
yeah

871.86 --> 875.36
well I mean

875.579 --> 881.8199999999999
I like the way he does it it's pretty

878.459 --> 884.04
intense and all that right I mean real

881.82 --> 886.1990000000001
Siri is acting

884.04 --> 888.66
like really being into it doing all that

886.199 --> 890.399
it's pretty it's like kind of draining

888.66 --> 891.6
on your system and he is getting a bit

890.399 --> 893.959
older

891.6 --> 893.9590000000001
right

901.579 --> 906.9799999999999
but I mean at some point he might just

904.139 --> 906.98
get back to it

910.5 --> 915.24
right when he feels the fire again in

913.079 --> 917.579
the background and it's like no like I'm

915.24 --> 922.5790000000001
I'm bored out of my mind I got it I got

917.579 --> 922.579
it get wacky in a movie

923.699 --> 929.4799999999999
so I anticipate that

926.04 --> 929.48
that happening at some point

948.54 --> 958.04
what okay that's weird Aries 106 weird

952.199 --> 958.04
ads huh hey Amanda young good see you I

967.68 --> 973.8
right so yeah something I could mention

969.92 --> 975.4799999999999
also here in the Netherlands man

973.8 --> 978.079
I mean there's something really weird

975.48 --> 978.0790000000001
has happened

979.199 --> 985.399
because like the party that I typically

982.26 --> 988.4399999999999
like for for democracy

985.399 --> 991.699
like it's like all of their votes have

988.44 --> 991.6990000000001
been erased or something

992.22 --> 996.9590000000001
and this is like

994.32 --> 999.0
like that

996.959 --> 1001.5189999999999
there's no way there's no way that

999.0 --> 1005.199
that's real so there's been massive

1001.519 --> 1005.199
tempering with the voting actually

1009.139 --> 1015.0790000000001
and there's just weird maneuvering going

1011.899 --> 1017.06
on in general I don't know man

1015.079 --> 1020.06
now they're talking about how they're

1017.06 --> 1023.7199999999999
literally going to just

1020.06 --> 1026.4189999999999
tax people on owning houses

1023.72 --> 1029.24
so it's not like inheritance tax or

1026.419 --> 1030.439
whatever but just owning it on a yearly

1029.24 --> 1034.04
basis

1030.439 --> 1036.559
that is completely insane because that

1034.04 --> 1039.76
like there's nobody in the country that

1036.559 --> 1039.76
can actually pay that

1040.04 --> 1045.26
so if you like you have house and land

1043.16 --> 1046.64
you're gonna have to now pay according

1045.26 --> 1049.58
to them

1046.64 --> 1053.8400000000001
still in power now we have to pay taxes

1049.58 --> 1056.9189999999999
on them that literally nobody can afford

1053.84 --> 1060.98
like unless you have like a pot of money

1056.919 --> 1064.64
of like a billion to burn off

1060.98 --> 1068.74
just to retain your property

1064.64 --> 1068.74
so this is like really bad

1076.28 --> 1081.98
yeah no [ __ ] it's a good way to reclaim

1079.46 --> 1084.919
but it's just

1081.98 --> 1086.13
this is just a really heavy robbery

1084.919 --> 1087.5590000000002
really

1086.13 --> 1092.8400000000001
[Music]

1087.559 --> 1094.8799999999999
to just subtly decide to to roll out a

1092.84 --> 1097.52
text like that and now like

1094.88 --> 1101.0
like everything is gonna go bust you see

1097.52 --> 1103.539
everything is gonna go bust this way

1101.0 --> 1103.539
everything

1105.26 --> 1110.72
it's like they want it they want they

1108.02 --> 1113.66
are communist revolutionaries the only

1110.72 --> 1114.74
reason they do things is to destroy this

1113.66 --> 1118.1200000000001
country

1114.74 --> 1118.1200000000001
everything they've done

1118.58 --> 1125.26
is to destroy the country

1121.16 --> 1125.26
it's absolutely absurd

1128.84 --> 1132.6999999999998
Bank scratching yeah we heard

1133.82 --> 1138.62
mostly been us though like that was kind

1136.16 --> 1141.799
of funny too I got a message like a text

1138.62 --> 1143.36
message on my mobile from my bank so

1141.799 --> 1147.26
you're like oh it's a really important

1143.36 --> 1149.4189999999999
message like okay they sent me it it was

1147.26 --> 1151.1
such an important message they sent me a

1149.419 --> 1154.3400000000001
text on my phone

1151.1 --> 1156.1399999999999
okay so I checked it and it was

1154.34 --> 1157.58
basically saying like oh yeah we can

1156.14 --> 1161.24
guarantee

1157.58 --> 1165.039
like we can ensure your money that you

1161.24 --> 1165.039
have typically is insured

1165.98 --> 1171.6200000000001
like what

1168.2 --> 1173.78
okay my money that my bank account is

1171.62 --> 1177.1999999999998
assured apparently because they are

1173.78 --> 1178.46
anticipating literally money just being

1177.2 --> 1180.8600000000001
grabbed

1178.46 --> 1183.44
apparently

1180.86 --> 1186.08
like that's that was their attitude like

1183.44 --> 1188.299
people were literally like that's

1186.08 --> 1191.48
potentially possible that

1188.299 --> 1193.8799999999999
banks are just gonna grab giant swaths

1191.48 --> 1197.3600000000001
of cash from people's bank accounts if

1193.88 --> 1199.5800000000002
they have it no there is sound not evil

1197.36 --> 1201.82
nightmare just freaking work it out

1199.58 --> 1201.82
yourself

1209.78 --> 1213.16
yes it's just you

1216.21 --> 1219.579
[Music]

1221.059 --> 1226.3999999999999
your attack from your bank it's saying

1223.7 --> 1229.46
it's a phishing scam well

1226.4 --> 1232.64
it was specifically asking me to check

1229.46 --> 1236.24
like the on

1232.64 --> 1238.5800000000002
like the online bank messages so that's

1236.24 --> 1241.1
that's not really a scam because it's

1238.58 --> 1243.1399999999999
not it's not asking me to click a link

1241.1 --> 1244.6999999999998
or anything

1243.14 --> 1246.5590000000002
it was just saying no there's an

1244.7 --> 1248.78
important message

1246.559 --> 1251.48
okay

1248.78 --> 1253.52
yeah this is not some banking email like

1251.48 --> 1255.679
oh we we need you to update your

1253.52 --> 1257.9
password just use this link now I'm not

1255.679 --> 1259.88
an idiot yeah this never happened to me

1257.9 --> 1263.5
before it will never happen to me

1259.88 --> 1263.5
because I'm not an idiot

1264.26 --> 1269.69
uh

1266.51 --> 1269.69
[Music]

1287.419 --> 1290.96
you have a lot of money in the bank you

1289.22 --> 1294.159
want to take money out yeah I can

1290.96 --> 1294.159
imagine a manly Young

1294.559 --> 1298.24
I don't know what you could do though

1300.98 --> 1306.159
maybe you can

1302.98 --> 1306.159
insure it

1313.76 --> 1318.64
or I don't know invest it yeah but I'm

1317.059 --> 1321.6789999999999
not gonna

1318.64 --> 1324.26
or you can send me some PayPal so it

1321.679 --> 1326.659
could have like proper dinner this

1324.26 --> 1328.4
weekend that would be awesome

1326.659 --> 1331.2800000000002
menu

1328.4 --> 1335.44
please anybody else

1331.28 --> 1335.44
I could really use some support guys

1336.5 --> 1339.34
I'm broke

1341.24 --> 1346.4
excited what happened

1344.179 --> 1349.52
you guys helped me out last weekend and

1346.4 --> 1351.44
that's why I haven't been broke all week

1349.52 --> 1354.2
but uh

1351.44 --> 1356.38
yeah there's only so far I can go with

1354.2 --> 1356.38
it

1356.419 --> 1361.22
I have to say though they're really in

1358.34 --> 1363.9189999999999
general compared to like since I stopped

1361.22 --> 1366.8600000000001
drinking it has really made it easier on

1363.919 --> 1369.74
me financially too I guess it it all did

1366.86 --> 1372.1999999999998
add up together

1369.74 --> 1374.98
but I mean yeah there's only so far I

1372.2 --> 1374.98
can go with that

1391.58 --> 1397.3999999999999
I don't know either well yeah what

1394.52 --> 1401.9
George stand for I mean

1397.4 --> 1406.72
gold and silver bullion might be a good

1401.9 --> 1406.72
way to quickly transform it

1408.62 --> 1414.82
and you have to hide it somewhere then

1411.38 --> 1414.8200000000002
though that's the difference

1417.14 --> 1423.919
or yeah put it in some vault

1421.58 --> 1425.96
you I mean you can literally like buy

1423.919 --> 1429.5
just chunks of gold

1425.96 --> 1430.82
and put it in in a vault in the bank I

1429.5 --> 1433.12
mean they're not going to confiscate

1430.82 --> 1433.12
that

1433.82 --> 1437.72
especially if they don't know what's in

1435.919 --> 1441.159
it

1437.72 --> 1441.159
so you could try that

1449.919 --> 1455.72
should start a bank

1452.96 --> 1457.64
we can trust you with our money right oh

1455.72 --> 1460.24
yeah yeah

1457.64 --> 1460.24
but

1461.96 --> 1466.4
it's really cool and look I'll you could

1464.6 --> 1469.52
trust me with your money but I mean I do

1466.4 --> 1472.46
have expenses though

1469.52 --> 1474.32
like I'm not gonna just like oh yeah

1472.46 --> 1475.88
I'll take care of your hundreds of

1474.32 --> 1478.6399999999999
thousands of dollars

1475.88 --> 1481.48
while for my own budget I can barely eat

1478.64 --> 1486.5590000000002
okay that's

1481.48 --> 1489.5
yeah but I mean banking seems cool

1486.559 --> 1492.22
what you could potentially do

1489.5 --> 1492.22
with it

1497.29 --> 1503.0
[Music]

1500.12 --> 1505.4189999999999
but uh yeah that's not really an option

1503.0 --> 1505.419
right now

1519.34 --> 1524.4399999999998
now what I was wondering in my mind

1524.48 --> 1530.419
was like maybe oh and Benjamin at some

1528.02 --> 1532.82
point is gonna start a bank

1530.419 --> 1536.179
sounds weird right

1532.82 --> 1538.6589999999999
but I mean you might be able to like

1536.179 --> 1538.659
have a

1539.84 --> 1543.1589999999999
a bank that's like

1544.059 --> 1552.3999999999999
uh yeah that's not based on usury

1548.299 --> 1552.4
like in if there's just enough

1552.559 --> 1558.279
economy bear economy go around like he

1555.14 --> 1558.279
might be able to do that

1559.58 --> 1565.22
to have like a banking service

1563.299 --> 1568.0
that's completely in the pen it's not

1565.22 --> 1568.0
going to be pushed around

1568.46 --> 1574.88
by the banking cartels so maybe right I

1572.9 --> 1576.5590000000002
thought of that yesterday even like hmm

1574.88 --> 1578.72
maybe he could

1576.559 --> 1580.46
start a bank or something

1578.72 --> 1584.659
I mean that would be quite an adventure

1580.46 --> 1588.039
and he has the Jews now so

1584.659 --> 1588.0390000000002
that might be an option

1588.279 --> 1593.419
you get a small commission okay that's

1591.08 --> 1596.96
cute dude hey if you're gonna throw a

1593.419 --> 1598.88
giant amount of money again at me for

1596.96 --> 1600.98
keeping or something

1598.88 --> 1604.0590000000002
but you've got to realize that if I if

1600.98 --> 1609.02
like if you're just gonna pilot

1604.059 --> 1611.44
digitally on onto my bank then

1609.02 --> 1615.26
I'm gonna have the same problem probably

1611.44 --> 1617.96
also yeah I mean

1615.26 --> 1621.52
I bet the tax agencies are gonna get

1617.96 --> 1621.52
involved also if that happens

1623.84 --> 1630.08
so unless you you plan to send me like a

1626.96 --> 1635.8600000000001
box filled with cash money

1630.08 --> 1635.86
this might not be a solution Aries 106.

1646.36 --> 1650.4399999999998
allow us let's see you

1663.39 --> 1666.539
[Music]

1674.36 --> 1679.82
right but anyway please support me

1677.96 --> 1681.38
through the PayPal I really need it

1679.82 --> 1683.84
today

1681.38 --> 1685.5200000000002
I mean I'm gonna get to the point where

1683.84 --> 1687.799
if I don't get any I'm just not gonna

1685.52 --> 1690.4
stream this weekend

1687.799 --> 1690.4
you know

1690.62 --> 1693.799
that's what it takes to get your

1692.659 --> 1697.0
attention

1693.799 --> 1697.0
and I will do that

1708.679 --> 1714.6200000000001
we will just ship boxes with Cole and

1711.559 --> 1717.26
this is okay well if you want to risk

1714.62 --> 1719.4189999999999
that but I mean yeah sending gold over

1717.26 --> 1723.46
the mail

1719.419 --> 1723.46
that seems highly risky

1737.659 --> 1742.159
but I mean why would you need to send me

1740.179 --> 1745.4
anything if you're just gonna

1742.159 --> 1747.0800000000002
buy gold like why would I need to keep

1745.4 --> 1749.419
that gold for you in another country

1747.08 --> 1751.8799999999999
here so that seems kind of weird

1749.419 --> 1754.8200000000002
I mean your gold doesn't take up that

1751.88 --> 1758.0
much place right unless you're like a

1754.82 --> 1760.399
billionaire or something but

1758.0 --> 1762.159
I think gold is pretty easy to stash

1760.399 --> 1765.559
away

1762.159 --> 1768.8600000000001
right I mean it's like

1765.559 --> 1773.02
twenty thousand dollars is like this

1768.86 --> 1773.02
much right it

1774.679 --> 1780.26
like one of the really typical big bars

1778.039 --> 1783.1
of gold those are

1780.26 --> 1783.1
a lot

1783.26 --> 1789.52
no they do weigh something but I mean it

1786.44 --> 1789.52
doesn't take up much space

1817.34 --> 1822.86
right anyway

1819.62 --> 1825.3799999999999
yeah still hassle going on

1822.86 --> 1828.08
in the Netherlands seems like the voting

1825.38 --> 1830.48
has been raked this form of democracy is

1828.08 --> 1832.8799999999999
just not registering at all like they

1830.48 --> 1834.38
didn't get one seat even though they

1832.88 --> 1836.2
were highly popular

1834.38 --> 1839.5390000000002
now this

1836.2 --> 1843.3400000000001
BBB just kind of a suspicious name

1839.539 --> 1843.34
really because it's the same

1844.22 --> 1849.74
acronym for build back better yeah

1847.7 --> 1851.72
that's staring Us in the face but that

1849.74 --> 1854.059
one had a massive profit and it's

1851.72 --> 1857.08
basically taken

1854.059 --> 1860.12
the first chamber part of the government

1857.08 --> 1862.6399999999999
organization and has taken a big chunk

1860.12 --> 1866.4189999999999
of it all out of nowhere

1862.64 --> 1868.1000000000001
but there is suspicions about this party

1866.419 --> 1870.5590000000002
that they could be a controlled

1868.1 --> 1872.6
opposition that's just gonna suddenly

1870.559 --> 1875.12
switch around

1872.6 --> 1877.52
I mean they they got a really smooth

1875.12 --> 1880.6399999999999
opportunity to get in there

1877.52 --> 1884.4189999999999
so what I actually feel is that that

1880.64 --> 1886.159
party has been a controlled opposition

1884.419 --> 1888.44
just

1886.159 --> 1891.44
to get form of democracy out of the way

1888.44 --> 1894.02
because former democracy is isn't the

1891.44 --> 1898.96
party entirely is being treated like

1894.02 --> 1898.96
Trump is being treated in America

1899.179 --> 1906.5
like these cartel politicians are like

1902.84 --> 1910.58
making criminal level efforts to keep

1906.5 --> 1913.76
them out criminal level effort like very

1910.58 --> 1916.76
overtly criminal level effort like

1913.76 --> 1919.539
people know that they're doing that it's

1916.76 --> 1919.539
really [ __ ] up

1919.94 --> 1924.6200000000001
and I think that that they've been

1922.64 --> 1928.22
systematically

1924.62 --> 1930.1999999999998
uh yeah cheated out of out of being part

1928.22 --> 1932.8990000000001
of the government now

1930.2 --> 1935.779
in the first chamber because of this

1932.899 --> 1938.899
because they did not show up

1935.779 --> 1941.899
like at all like in a map of the country

1938.899 --> 1943.9399999999998
and like all the regions voting I would

1941.899 --> 1946.76
roughly turn out who's the winner they

1943.94 --> 1950.8600000000001
did not show up at all

1946.76 --> 1954.919
which is absolutely absurd

1950.86 --> 1957.559
absurd they were literally like pulled

1954.919 --> 1960.919
at the highest level

1957.559 --> 1962.299
and they did not even show up on the

1960.919 --> 1965.1200000000001
charts

1962.299 --> 1967.82
I mean I cannot think of a more overt

1965.12 --> 1970.8799999999999
voting fraud

1967.82 --> 1973.72
that has happened than this I mean this

1970.88 --> 1977.1200000000001
is worse than the freaking Biden

1973.72 --> 1979.22
[ __ ] fraud fraud and all that steal

1977.12 --> 1982.52
the elections like this is worse I mean

1979.22 --> 1984.98
although that one was more in your face

1982.52 --> 1988.4189999999999
like the cheating was just visibly on

1984.98 --> 1988.419
camera and [ __ ] and [ __ ]

1988.58 --> 1993.32
I don't think it's it went that far here

1990.799 --> 1995.559
but there has been fraud it makes no

1993.32 --> 1995.559
sense

1997.039 --> 2004.48
like it's completely illogical

2001.36 --> 2007.779
because votes for this party has just

2004.48 --> 2010.72
not even shown up on the radar

2007.779 --> 2012.279
when they are like the number three

2010.72 --> 2015.279
three

2012.279 --> 2018.24
in the polls like that makes no sense

2015.279 --> 2021.34
people that's called fraud that's called

2018.24 --> 2023.64
somebody rigged the [ __ ] out of the

2021.34 --> 2023.6399999999999
voting

2025.059 --> 2029.58
and there should be criminal

2026.679 --> 2033.96
investigations and rapidly

2029.58 --> 2033.96
rapidly very quickly

2035.44 --> 2038.88
what the hell is going on here

2044.08 --> 2052.7999999999997
what I found a gold ring oh lucky you

2048.899 --> 2052.7999999999997
are you sure it's real gold

2054.76 --> 2057.599
hmm

2063.04 --> 2069.419
all right so yeah I'm uh

2065.379 --> 2069.419
a bit unsettle about all this

2080.56 --> 2089.02
yeah but also I'm just I'm really

2085.0 --> 2091.78
surprised I'm really surprised

2089.02 --> 2094.96
because I'm not really hearing too much

2091.78 --> 2098.2000000000003
from them about this

2094.96 --> 2100.7200000000003
I mean they've literally been just wiped

2098.2 --> 2102.46
off the map

2100.72 --> 2106.54
through the votes

2102.46 --> 2108.64
and I'm not hearing anything of them so

2106.54 --> 2112.32
what the hell are they doing or are they

2108.64 --> 2112.3199999999997
now just admitting defeat

2115.079 --> 2121.619
what is going on here

2117.64 --> 2121.6189999999997
why I'm not hearing anything from them

2121.96 --> 2127.66
the last thing I heard was just them

2124.72 --> 2129.7599999999998
some of those politicians talking at the

2127.66 --> 2132.06
protesting that's the last thing I heard

2129.76 --> 2132.0600000000004
of them

2132.4 --> 2138.48
I'm not seeing any new articles that's

2135.099 --> 2138.48
really weird I don't understand

2146.03 --> 2151.44
[Music]

2148.18 --> 2151.44
let me check Twitter

2153.099 --> 2156.099
foreign

2186.099 --> 2191.7000000000003
thank you

2187.54 --> 2191.7
this is absolutely absurd

2214.32 --> 2218.46
I yeah I don't know

2231.94 --> 2236.14
right anyway

2233.92 --> 2238.38
please donate to my PayPal I really need

2236.14 --> 2238.3799999999997
it

2239.02 --> 2243.599
if you don't I'm not gonna do a show

2241.18 --> 2243.5989999999997
this weekend

2244.839 --> 2250.54
I'll just do something else

2248.32 --> 2253.06
maybe go in the direction of like oh

2250.54 --> 2255.099
yeah maybe I should just get work and

2253.06 --> 2257.68
completely discontinue the Flat Earth

2255.099 --> 2259.839
early bird show again

2257.68 --> 2263.44
because that's the only thing that makes

2259.839 --> 2267.599
people support me now apparently if I

2263.44 --> 2267.599
just say that and I will do it

2270.16 --> 2273.7
right

2271.119 --> 2278.1400000000003
I mean I love doing this show

2273.7 --> 2281.14
but I can't do it for free I cannot

2278.14 --> 2283.839
and a part-time job doesn't work I'm on

2281.14 --> 2286.72
social welfare if I take a part-time job

2283.839 --> 2290.02
then I lose that extra time for the

2286.72 --> 2292.24
part-time job and then I have to pay all

2290.02 --> 2295.119
of the money I make from that part-time

2292.24 --> 2297.5789999999997
job back to the government because I'm

2295.119 --> 2298.78
still on social welfare yeah it doesn't

2297.579 --> 2301.3590000000004
work

2298.78 --> 2304.3590000000004
this is the [ __ ] Netherlands

2301.359 --> 2307.839
it doesn't work part-time job is not

2304.359 --> 2311.38
going to be a financial solution

2307.839 --> 2314.68
support is a financial solution very

2311.38 --> 2317.88
acutely helping solution

2314.68 --> 2317.8799999999997
but it's got to be there

2321.7 --> 2324.91
[Music]

2327.099 --> 2332.099
so I'd really appreciate it

2329.26 --> 2332.099
foreign

2333.099 --> 2338.7400000000002
hey and if it's not worth it to you guys

2335.26 --> 2341.32
then I'll just end the show and my

2338.74 --> 2344.68
activities here

2341.32 --> 2347.7400000000002
that will also mean eventually leave the

2344.68 --> 2351.5789999999997
Flat Earth debates because I need to do

2347.74 --> 2355.5989999999997
something else then to try to meet ends

2351.579 --> 2357.2200000000003
yeah like try to figure out some kind of

2355.599 --> 2359.6800000000003
a career

2357.22 --> 2362.02
it's not gonna like just break me apart

2359.68 --> 2365.14
and whatever

2362.02 --> 2367.42
and then I won't have time for media

2365.14 --> 2368.68
anymore which is what I'm doing right

2367.42 --> 2372.339
now

2368.68 --> 2374.7999999999997

2380.2 --> 2383.7599999999998
that's not how this works

2387.52 --> 2397.359
I'm not eager to just give you free [ __ ]

2393.16 --> 2401.5
to just give my all for nothing

2397.359 --> 2404.02
while I'm literally just

2401.5 --> 2407.2
anxious and

2404.02 --> 2410.32
nervous about not having enough money to

2407.2 --> 2413.14
get around like at all yeah as in being

2410.32 --> 2415.6600000000003
broke now I have what is it three Euros

2413.14 --> 2418.48
on my bank account right now three

2415.66 --> 2423.06
yeah that's it

2418.48 --> 2423.06
so support me or I'll go away

2432.16 --> 2435.16
oh

2436.599 --> 2439.2000000000003
thank you

2466.44 --> 2472.079
you're [ __ ] out of your mind Aries

2469.24 --> 2472.0789999999997
106.

2472.66 --> 2476.14
you know what's gonna happen if that

2474.7 --> 2478.4199999999996
happens

2476.14 --> 2481.5989999999997
there will be a [ __ ] Revolution

2478.42 --> 2484.42
unheard of it will be worse than

2481.599 --> 2487.119
idiocracy yeah

2484.42 --> 2488.98
if people are just like no just hang

2487.119 --> 2491.6800000000003
around because there's nothing that you

2488.98 --> 2493.3
could do that could help anything yeah

2491.68 --> 2498.0989999999997
guess what's gonna happen they're all

2493.3 --> 2498.099
gonna turn into hysterical retards

2501.099 --> 2506.579
is that a world you want to live in

2503.92 --> 2506.579
foreign

2512.56 --> 2516.52
or Talent

2514.54 --> 2518.98
to Me dance

2516.52 --> 2520.839
like at all is that the world you want

2518.98 --> 2522.52
to live in where everything is all just

2520.839 --> 2525.339
the same and doesn't really matter what

2522.52 --> 2527.619
the [ __ ] you do whether you contribute

2525.339 --> 2529.48
something that people care about or if

2527.619 --> 2533.32
you literally make everybody's life

2529.48 --> 2536.76
miserable it doesn't matter anymore then

2533.32 --> 2536.76
Aries 106.

2540.59 --> 2543.7290000000003
[Music]

2549.82 --> 2552.3
all right

2560.98 --> 2565.38
you're back welcome back Amanda you

2570.22 --> 2575.6189999999997
right so first hour in

2572.98 --> 2576.64
but I'm gonna keep mentioning it support

2575.619 --> 2579.88
me

2576.64 --> 2582.7799999999997
or the show is going to discontinue

2579.88 --> 2582.78
I mean it

2597.16 --> 2603.22
will breed like jackrabbits

2599.92 --> 2605.8
well not necessarily

2603.22 --> 2609.4199999999996
I think that it eventually it will lead

2605.8 --> 2609.42
to severe depression

2609.52 --> 2615.9
because if you have no function no

2612.94 --> 2615.9
purpose in life

2616.0 --> 2619.619
then you're going to lose your mind

2619.9 --> 2627.54
right if nothing you do actually matters

2623.92 --> 2627.54
then what's the point of living

2638.74 --> 2640.9799999999996
foreign

2650.22 --> 2657.5989999999997
of living is to do things you enjoy are

2653.619 --> 2657.599
you a [ __ ] Satanist Aries

2658.0 --> 2663.839
you really think that

2660.46 --> 2663.839
that that's the point of living

2663.94 --> 2669.2400000000002
that's satanic

2665.92 --> 2669.2400000000002
don't know if you know that

2675.52 --> 2679.2
it's not the point of living

2679.24 --> 2684.359
that's what you will tend to do

2684.819 --> 2689.52
that has nothing to do with the point

2686.98 --> 2689.52
though

2690.64 --> 2696.7
the point of living

2692.92 --> 2699.099
is having a purpose right feeling that

2696.7 --> 2701.7999999999997
spiritual connection

2699.099 --> 2704.94
yeah doing things you enjoy does not

2701.8 --> 2704.94
provide you that

2705.4 --> 2709.3
yeah

2706.839 --> 2711.5789999999997
just doing things you enjoy yeah people

2709.3 --> 2713.5
that actually go out and do that you

2711.579 --> 2716.7400000000002
know what happens to them they get

2713.5 --> 2721.66
really [ __ ] bored

2716.74 --> 2725.6189999999997
right why because there's no point

2721.66 --> 2728.74
there's no point no purpose

2725.619 --> 2732.2400000000002
doesn't do anything anymore you run out

2728.74 --> 2732.24
of joy for it

2732.4 --> 2734.579
foreign

2735.48 --> 2741.64
is not to reproduce

2738.579 --> 2747.46
that's a part of it

2741.64 --> 2750.46
it's a part of maintaining a family and

2747.46 --> 2754.56
it's a part of it if it's not the point

2750.46 --> 2754.56
point is to have a purpose

2760.119 --> 2764.76
to enjoy having spiritual purpose

2765.76 --> 2767.94
thank you

2770.92 --> 2777.599
yeah a purpose that's not that's not

2774.28 --> 2777.599
doing what I enjoy

2777.819 --> 2783.339
I enjoy having a purpose

2780.579 --> 2787.02
but having a purpose is not something

2783.339 --> 2788.5
you can do you have it or you don't

2787.02 --> 2791.02
[Music]

2788.5 --> 2793.359
it's not so it's not about something you

2791.02 --> 2796.06
physically automatically can do it's

2793.359 --> 2798.7599999999998
about what you hold in your spirit

2796.06 --> 2803.68
the reason why

2798.76 --> 2806.5200000000004
what it will amount to within your mind

2803.68 --> 2806.52
purpose

2809.319 --> 2815.5
that you enjoy it just makes it more

2812.92 --> 2817.78
delightful

2815.5 --> 2820.359
or easier for you to do that but it's

2817.78 --> 2823.8390000000004
the purpose that actually is the thing

2820.359 --> 2827.46
that matters that the purpose

2823.839 --> 2827.46
The Joy will run out

2828.76 --> 2830.94
foreign

2850.859 --> 2856.839
yeah and to what end

2854.56 --> 2859.599
though

2856.839 --> 2863.2
but as I said yeah it adds to it but

2859.599 --> 2867.819
that's not the purpose

2863.2 --> 2871.4199999999996
yeah you can't just say it's this thing

2867.819 --> 2875.2599999999998
this one thing that you can do is the

2871.42 --> 2878.079
purpose it doesn't work that way yeah

2875.26 --> 2881.98
it's not like that

2878.079 --> 2885.65
the point is is that it isn't like that

2881.98 --> 2888.78
you can't just point this is the purpose

2885.65 --> 2888.78
[Music]

2889.3 --> 2896.8590000000004
the point is is that you can't just have

2893.319 --> 2899.619
a list and then say here's the purpose

2896.859 --> 2900.72
that everybody should pick yeah it

2899.619 --> 2902.1400000000003
doesn't work that way

2900.72 --> 2904.85
[Music]

2902.14 --> 2906.52
at all

2904.85 --> 2910.56
[Music]

2906.52 --> 2913.78
you can't mechanize you can't

2910.56 --> 2918.4
roboticize purpose

2913.78 --> 2921.099
that is the point and the problem for

2918.4 --> 2923.7400000000002
all those people that just don't want to

2921.099 --> 2926.38
think they want to be robots they want

2923.74 --> 2930.04
to be automatons

2926.38 --> 2933.2200000000003
they don't want to think or choose they

2930.04 --> 2935.339
just want to do the program

2933.22 --> 2937.72
foreign

2935.339 --> 2939.94
like drones

2937.72 --> 2944.5
yeah well too bad

2939.94 --> 2947.88
purpose is not just one [ __ ] thing

2944.5 --> 2947.88
you have to figure it out

2956.71 --> 2959.82
[Music]

2965.859 --> 2968.339
all right

2970.9 --> 2973.2000000000003
foreign

2974.98 --> 2981.94
and if you continually reproduce where

2979.06 --> 2985.48
you will live in a world where you can't

2981.94 --> 2988.119
provide your children with a purpose for

2985.48 --> 2989.76
existing because the world doesn't need

2988.119 --> 2994.359
them anymore

2989.76 --> 2997.3
to con to continue existing yeah

2994.359 --> 2999.819
well then you're literally just creating

2997.3 --> 3002.819
children that will not have purpose that

2999.819 --> 3004.859
will not grow up learning the importance

3002.819 --> 3008.66
of having a purpose

3004.859 --> 3012.06
yeah you know what that leads to

3008.66 --> 3014.16
delusional people

3012.06 --> 3015.42
that don't know what they're doing that

3014.16 --> 3016.7999999999997
are chaotic

3015.42 --> 3019.14
that

3016.8 --> 3021.599
probably on average will be more

3019.14 --> 3024.359
destructive

3021.599 --> 3026.94
in what they want

3024.359 --> 3030.42
that's what that leads to yeah when you

3026.94 --> 3032.94
take away the purpose of people

3030.42 --> 3036.42
then they will just start to destroy the

3032.94 --> 3040.319
world yeah I mean people will eventually

3036.42 --> 3043.94
end up destroying the world

3040.319 --> 3047.04
to the point that they will be able to

3043.94 --> 3049.5
re-attain purpose yeah

3047.04 --> 3052.5
if literally [ __ ] robots in

3049.5 --> 3055.74
technology [ __ ] everywhere makes

3052.5 --> 3058.92
people obsolete then people will destroy

3055.74 --> 3061.52
technology so that they re-attain

3058.92 --> 3061.52
purpose

3064.74 --> 3073.5589999999997
it's very simple yeah technology steals

3070.02 --> 3077.48
the importance of an individual then

3073.559 --> 3077.48
technology will be destroyed

3077.579 --> 3080.579
foreign

3090.48 --> 3094.619
people will be destroyed and then there

3092.819 --> 3096.48
will be nothing left and then there will

3094.619 --> 3098.04
be no purpose

3096.48 --> 3100.26
in anything

3098.04 --> 3102.599
and will everything will just be and

3100.26 --> 3106.079
then there will be no more people

3102.599 --> 3107.28
and then some remnant robotic

3106.079 --> 3110.2200000000003
thing

3107.28 --> 3112.3190000000004
will just do whatever it was last

3110.22 --> 3114.72
instructed to do

3112.319 --> 3117.0589999999997
as there's no more people to even do

3114.72 --> 3118.68
anything with any any of it it will just

3117.059 --> 3121.6800000000003
be sitting there

3118.68 --> 3123.5989999999997
automated attempting to self-repair and

3121.68 --> 3126.1189999999997
then eventually that will dilapidate and

3123.599 --> 3128.28
then there will be nothing

3126.119 --> 3130.619
it would just be trash and dust

3128.28 --> 3134.42
everywhere

3130.619 --> 3134.42
and cities getting overgrown

3143.88 --> 3149.4
but do you believe the purposes in life

3145.98 --> 3152.16
I believe that nobody can actually

3149.4 --> 3155.839
answer that question

3152.16 --> 3155.839
without degrading themselves

3161.16 --> 3168.5989999999997
but I have personal

3164.04 --> 3173.7
goals and aims one of my purposes is to

3168.599 --> 3176.819
remain pure Against All Odds in spirit

3173.7 --> 3182.18
to do things as I do and not let

3176.819 --> 3182.18
anything take anything away from that

3182.94 --> 3190.7000000000003
to not let any outside influence change

3186.619 --> 3190.7000000000003
how I do and see things

3191.94 --> 3195.78
I will take information into

3193.68 --> 3198.96
consideration but I will never be

3195.78 --> 3200.579
changed manipulated even occultly yeah I

3198.96 --> 3204.059
don't even allow myself to be

3200.579 --> 3206.46
manipulated occultly like the entire

3204.059 --> 3209.28
world screaming from within the shadow

3206.46 --> 3213.2400000000002
silently to me to do something and it's

3209.28 --> 3216.619
like yeah go [ __ ] yourself entire world

3213.24 --> 3216.6189999999997
I'm not gonna do that

3217.67 --> 3223.559
[Music]

3220.5 --> 3224.94
I will do things the way that I do them

3223.559 --> 3229.579
because

3224.94 --> 3229.579
that's the only thing left

3229.619 --> 3234.059
and I detected this very young and it's

3232.079 --> 3237.3
the only thing left

3234.059 --> 3241.0400000000004
for me to do that would not end up

3237.3 --> 3241.04
making me lose my mind

3260.16 --> 3265.94
this is like watching dystopian sci-fi

3262.98 --> 3265.94
what are you talking about

3287.28 --> 3292.8
if you're gonna ask me intense questions

3290.3 --> 3295.079
personal questions then I'm gonna give

3292.8 --> 3297.619
you [ __ ] intense answers what the

3295.079 --> 3297.619
hell do you expect

3301.859 --> 3304.859
foreign

3310.04 --> 3315.42
what's your root of your existence what

3312.72 --> 3318.24
to avoid

3315.42 --> 3320.64
to to avoid the notion that hey I need

3318.24 --> 3322.5
support oh you're gonna ask me really

3320.64 --> 3324.839
intense questions that I hope it's gonna

3322.5 --> 3327.66
distract me away from

3324.839 --> 3332.24
yanking on your chain that I really need

3327.66 --> 3332.24
support or I will discontinue the show

3333.839 --> 3338.04
I think

3335.819 --> 3340.02
yeah and if I have to do that enough

3338.04 --> 3342.42
times then at some point it's gonna

3340.02 --> 3344.64
happen I will just discontinue it will

3342.42 --> 3348.0
be like a bad breakup and a bad breakup

3344.64 --> 3352.3799999999997
that's not gonna come back yeah after I

3348.0 --> 3356.099
do that I will not come back you see

3352.38 --> 3358.28
once that's happened it's over do you

3356.099 --> 3358.28
understand

3366.18 --> 3369.18
foreign

3377.599 --> 3383.339
with the robots was cinematic

3381.119 --> 3387.1800000000003
I guess

3383.339 --> 3389.4
it's just a logical extrapolation I mean

3387.18 --> 3391.859
that's what sci-fi is most of the time

3389.4 --> 3394.319
is just taking one setting and then just

3391.859 --> 3397.7
like what happens if you let that happen

3394.319 --> 3397.7
for like a hundred years

3399.0 --> 3401.78
that's it

3409.98 --> 3415.92
I don't know steamy traveler how about

3413.04 --> 3418.619
that I don't [ __ ] know I don't even

3415.92 --> 3420.66
know if I will have a wife

3418.619 --> 3422.28
if there is one out there that could

3420.66 --> 3425.7799999999997
work and it's not going to lead up to

3422.28 --> 3425.78
the same [ __ ] as with my ex

3427.2 --> 3432.319
I don't know man

3430.079 --> 3435.0
I just know that from this position

3432.319 --> 3437.7599999999998
continually having to beg for money

3435.0 --> 3439.619
because I just don't get it until I

3437.76 --> 3442.3190000000004
start threatening everybody with

3439.619 --> 3443.7000000000003
discontinuing the show I know that

3442.319 --> 3447.18
that

3443.7 --> 3451.4399999999996
activity on average in that situation is

3447.18 --> 3454.74
not gonna help me lead to any of that

3451.44 --> 3459.079
what you're asking about right now yeah

3454.74 --> 3459.0789999999997
it's Just Gonna Keep Me stuck here

3462.599 --> 3468.92
yeah unless I get more support

3466.859 --> 3472.98
and then maybe

3468.92 --> 3475.92
we could I don't know not [ __ ] worry

3472.98 --> 3480.2
about money all the time

3475.92 --> 3480.2000000000003
maybe get some new pants

3480.48 --> 3487.4
and then perhaps meet my future wife

3483.859 --> 3487.4
that would be great

3493.38 --> 3499.02
but if I'm just doing this show just to

3495.839 --> 3502.2
waste two hours of my time every day to

3499.02 --> 3504.8
entertain people that are just bored and

3502.2 --> 3504.7999999999997
hanging around

3506.04 --> 3514.5
without any financial support

3509.819 --> 3517.04
then [ __ ] this show and [ __ ] you guys

3514.5 --> 3517.04
okay

3519.72 --> 3526.3999999999996
it's not that entertaining to me doing

3523.44 --> 3526.4
this every day

3528.24 --> 3535.2599999999998
yeah I've grown to like it it's not

3531.839 --> 3538.14
like oh oh I can't really quit you guys

3535.26 --> 3540.599
because I just have to see you every day

3538.14 --> 3542.04
in the chat talking to you it's I know

3540.599 --> 3545.819
you some of you are so long it's so

3542.04 --> 3549.48
great yeah no no no no no I need support

3545.819 --> 3551.66
or I will [ __ ] off and not continue the

3549.48 --> 3551.66
show

3553.5 --> 3560.22
no I don't get money from fed for [ __ ]

3558.119 --> 3563.28
sake

3560.22 --> 3566.0989999999997
yeah I don't get paid by them I need

3563.28 --> 3569.0400000000004
support from you guys and that's it

3566.099 --> 3572.7200000000003
that's the support Source that's the

3569.04 --> 3572.72
only one you get it

3572.88 --> 3579.6600000000003
I don't get paid by other shows

3576.24 --> 3582.4199999999996
thus people are scouring for support

3579.66 --> 3584.16
themselves yeah they don't have money

3582.42 --> 3585.9
for that [ __ ]

3584.16 --> 3588.24
maybe in a stunt

3585.9 --> 3590.4
like in a certain moment like with the

3588.24 --> 3592.74
choco fund

3590.4 --> 3595.099
then I could miss because to get things

3592.74 --> 3595.0989999999997
going

3600.299 --> 3603.54
right hey but if you guys if you're all

3602.4 --> 3606.78
just

3603.54 --> 3610.319
fine just letting the trolls roll out

3606.78 --> 3616.099
while my PayPal remains empty then today

3610.319 --> 3619.339

3616.099 --> 3619.339
your hair

3630.0 --> 3634.52

3631.74 --> 3634.52

3644.22 --> 3652.4599999999996
yeah I don't like spending

3647.76 --> 3652.46
a prolonged amount of time

3652.68 --> 3657.1189999999997
having to tell people this yeah

3655.319 --> 3660.72
basically

3657.119 --> 3662.28
not being a Nag on my own show just to

3660.72 --> 3666.0589999999997
get your [ __ ] attention to get

3662.28 --> 3668.0400000000004
support okay it's not a joke to me this

3668.04 --> 3673.319
look away or something if you're looking

3670.92 --> 3676.6800000000003

trolls when you know they're a troll and

3887.579 --> 3893.099
you should know they are a troll

3889.559 --> 3896.4

showing up in chat guess what you do you

3896.4 --> 3901.859

3949.38 --> 3955.04
discontinue the show

3951.599 --> 3955.04
send the package what

3957.299 --> 3962.579

4007.76 --> 4015.7400000000002
true oh thanks oh yes I need advice oh

4011.599 --> 4018.98
because I know I don't know Gemini Luna

4015.74 --> 4021.4399999999996
I mean I only been streaming every day

4018.98 --> 4023.9
for [ __ ] eight years straight I don't

4021.44 --> 4026.78
know that the trolls are attracted to me

4023.9 --> 4029.48
getting angry at all thanks for telling

4026.78 --> 4032.1800000000003
me I would have never thought of that in

4029.48 --> 4034.7
my eight years of streaming every

4032.18 --> 4037.22
[ __ ] day I would have never figured

4034.7 --> 4039.74
it out that trolls are attracted to me

4037.22 --> 4043.5789999999997
getting angry oh

4039.74 --> 4046.22
thanks thanks for letting me know I

4043.579 --> 4050.559
don't know how I could have missed that

4046.22 --> 4050.5589999999997
in eight years of streaming every day

4075.559 --> 4080.059
no troll

4077.539 --> 4083.9
best part of the day is

4080.059 --> 4085.6400000000003
where I just delete you

4083.9 --> 4088.4
and

4085.64 --> 4091.8799999999997
like it's like I never even read

4088.4 --> 4096.52
anything that you said there's you see

4091.88 --> 4096.52
people like you don't really exist to me

4097.64 --> 4103.6990000000005
and your virtual quick message that you

4101.299 --> 4107.06
think you roll out somehow is somehow

4103.699 --> 4109.8189999999995
doing some communicating it's just gone

4107.06 --> 4111.1990000000005
like there's nothing coming through you

4109.819 --> 4114.02
see

4111.199 --> 4116.178999999999
when I know notice that somebody is

4114.02 --> 4117.319
trying to troll communicate like that

4116.179 --> 4120.9800000000005
then

4117.319 --> 4125.9800000000005
I literally ensure that it's erased that

4120.98 --> 4125.98
nothing actually hits me in any way

4126.319 --> 4133.580000000001
that it doesn't even touch

4129.259 --> 4138.319
my cognitive processes you see

4133.58 --> 4141.44
so I'm perfectly fine with weenie weirdo

4138.319 --> 4144.02
Shadow trolls that like to quickly say

4141.44 --> 4145.759
something in the middle again oh like

4144.02 --> 4148.64
they're hiding like a bunch of

4145.759 --> 4149.359
cockroaches like it doesn't matter to me

4148.64 --> 4153.1
man

4149.359 --> 4153.1
doesn't matter that you do that

4160.04 --> 4165.739
but it is a sign of mental illness

4163.16 --> 4167.719
though I'd have to say that people that

4165.739 --> 4172.54
do that in chats

4167.719 --> 4172.54
they have mental issues palpably

4174.92 --> 4181.66
you should get psycho therapy treatment

4178.52 --> 4181.660000000001
for that

4195.22 --> 4199.92
[Music]

4206.28 --> 4215.98
[Music]

4213.44 --> 4215.98
right

4217.16 --> 4221.44
but uh yeah I need some more support

4222.56 --> 4227.3
or tomorrow is going to be another day

4224.9 --> 4230.0599999999995
whining about getting support quickly

4227.3 --> 4232.400000000001
because this I mean I do appreciate it

4230.06 --> 4234.92
from skeptic he did follow through but I

4232.4 --> 4237.639999999999

4271.94 --> 4277.4

where I really nailed the Ballers I

4411.08 --> 4415.04
really did

4412.64 --> 4417.56
and I think I deserved some support I

4415.04 --> 4420.199
even said it during that show

4417.56 --> 4421.219
because I did great and I didn't get

that's right

4454.46 --> 4459.199

4548.54 --> 4553.34
eventually if you just hold on to no no

4551.42 --> 4555.32
I didn't have any no I'm just gonna

4553.34 --> 4557.900000000001
claim this [ __ ]

4555.32 --> 4559.639999999999
with a good alien on the moon which that

4557.9 --> 4561.08
didn't have a [ __ ] gradient you

4559.64 --> 4563.3
[ __ ] [ __ ]

4561.08 --> 4565.64
it's just as bright in the middle as at

4563.3 --> 4568.52
the side I kept saying

4565.64 --> 4571.400000000001
well you're just like no no it's just

4568.52 --> 4573.620000000001
different because in my model reality

4571.4 --> 4576.739
it's just different and I'm so suspended

4573.62 --> 4578.96
in my belief and I'll literally make my

4576.739 --> 4581.0599999999995
eyes see different things that aren't

4578.96 --> 4584.06
there because you're a delusional

who what where

4586.34 --> 4590.54
that literally can't even trust his own

4590.54 --> 4596.3
because you don't see things as they are

4592.82 --> 4599.86
you're just a delusional [ __ ] [ __ ]

4596.3 --> 4599.860000000001
baltard [ __ ]

4605.12 --> 4609.14
and now you got a timer

4607.34 --> 4611.179
if you start whining again I'm gonna

4609.14 --> 4613.46
kick you the [ __ ] out I don't even know

4611.179 --> 4615.9800000000005
who you are you just arrived a few days

4613.46 --> 4617.2390000000005
ago just to be a [ __ ] ball [ __ ] you

4615.98 --> 4620.12
could be just one of these troll

4617.239 --> 4622.58
[ __ ] trying to maneuver your way in

4620.12 --> 4625.42
again so I'm just gonna probably kick

4622.58 --> 4625.42
you the [ __ ] up

4625.58 --> 4628.48
foreign

4631.36 --> 4636.699
that's the opposite of what I told you

4634.28 --> 4636.699
dick

4638.659 --> 4643.5199999999995
I told you that you don't trust your own

4642.08 --> 4647.5599999999995
senses

4643.52 --> 4647.56
you're projecting [ __ ]

4654.34 --> 4661.88
I told you that you don't trust your

4658.52 --> 4664.9400000000005
senses not that you shouldn't

4661.88 --> 4669.14
I didn't tell you not to do that

4664.94 --> 4672.739
I told you you don't provably

4669.14 --> 4675.8
you don't trust your own senses

4672.739 --> 4678.32
you trust your [ __ ] imagination about

4675.8 --> 4680.900000000001
how everything is a ball and that's the

4678.32 --> 4684.0199999999995
only thing you even listen to

4680.9 --> 4687.379999999999
because you can't even look at a photo

4684.02 --> 4689.0
and see what you're seeing you're seeing

4687.38 --> 4691.82
the [ __ ] thing in your mind you see

4689.0 --> 4693.5
no it has a gradient why because it has

4691.82 --> 4695.96
to have a gradient

4693.5 --> 4699.02
it doesn't but I'm looking at it and it

4695.96 --> 4701.0
has a gradient because I think it has a

4699.02 --> 4702.620000000001
gradient because you're a delusional

4701.0 --> 4705.38
[ __ ]

4702.62 --> 4707.0599999999995
that looks at things and then only sees

4705.38 --> 4710.3
what they imagine

4707.06 --> 4714.820000000001
a delusional [ __ ] wit

4710.3 --> 4714.820000000001
is what you are who what where

4720.14 --> 4726.14
oh PayPal again skeptic

4722.719 --> 4728.719
but you didn't have the maneuvering room

4726.14 --> 4731.900000000001
okay

4728.719 --> 4735.08
well thank you again

4731.9 --> 4737.42
same amount yeah now I'm

4735.08 --> 4739.1

thank you very much Captain you're

4739.1 --> 4741.34
awesome

4747.76 --> 4753.1990000000005

4753.199 --> 4758.0
still working though

4755.78 --> 4760.639999999999
all right thank you very much I'll stop

4758.0 --> 4762.679
complaining now

4760.64 --> 4765.26
except if you want me to complain more

4762.679 --> 4768.4400000000005
nah I'm not gonna complain about support

4765.26 --> 4771.08
I'm gonna complain about ball Tarts not

4768.44 --> 4772.759999999999
getting it after like I tell them one

4771.08 --> 4774.679
and a half hours straight like oh look

4772.76 --> 4777.1990000000005
at this picture oh look it's just this

4774.679 --> 4780.8
bright at the side as in the center no

4777.199 --> 4783.62
it's a gradient it's not though it's

4780.8 --> 4787.96
just same color same brightness nothing

4783.62 --> 4791.3
radiant you [ __ ] no you're not

4787.96 --> 4793.219
describing what you're looking at

4791.3 --> 4795.9800000000005
you're describing something you're

4793.219 --> 4799.1
seeing in your mind because it has to be

4795.98 --> 4801.379999999999
there according to the idea in your mind

4799.1 --> 4805.2390000000005
but it isn't

4801.38 --> 4805.2390000000005
you're not trusting your own eyes

4810.62 --> 4813.62
no

4815.96 --> 4819.82
it doesn't [ __ ] matter dude

4824.12 --> 4830.84
I think that the vast majority is like

4827.48 --> 4833.299999999999
they don't care and they've accepted it

4830.84 --> 4834.860000000001
it's like oh okay Globe is a lie okay

4833.3 --> 4837.88
whatever

4834.86 --> 4837.88
let's move on

4839.239 --> 4845.12
it's really just these freaks that just

4842.36 --> 4847.839999999999
can't let go of their own [ __ ] that

4845.12 --> 4847.84
keep hanging around

4848.12 --> 4853.64
like yeah it has to be a ball I couldn't

4850.76 --> 4856.159000000001
have been lied to my entire life and

4853.64 --> 4858.4400000000005
then bought the lie and then reinforced

4856.159 --> 4860.0599999999995
that lie because I loved it so much it

4858.44 --> 4863.0599999999995
can be that

4860.06 --> 4865.6990000000005
no no no all the logical foundations and

4863.06 --> 4867.679
just mechanics in general no they have

4865.699 --> 4870.259999999999
to be wrong

4867.679 --> 4873.1990000000005
because they're telling me it's not a

4870.26 --> 4875.179
sphere and it has to be one

4873.199 --> 4877.699
because that's what I've been told all

4875.179 --> 4879.92
my life and I want to believe it and so

4877.699 --> 4881.849999999999
I will try to force that beliefs or

4879.92 --> 4884.919
belief on the entire world

4881.85 --> 4884.919000000001
[Music]

4894.26 --> 4898.52
I want to believe letters that you don't

4896.9 --> 4901.099999999999
have to believe Flat Earth you just have

4898.52 --> 4903.1990000000005
to recognize that it is flat

4901.1 --> 4906.56
it's nothing to do with belief it's

4903.199 --> 4912.0199999999995
allowing your mind to unbend

4906.56 --> 4913.219
to let go of the stupid machinations

4912.02 --> 4917.0
yeah

4913.219 --> 4919.04
it's like stop doing drugs

4917.0 --> 4921.8
like a certain drug a party drug or

4919.04 --> 4924.26
whatever and you're like oh man but I

4921.8 --> 4925.159000000001
party so hard with the drug oh I gotta

4924.26 --> 4927.4400000000005
do it

4925.159 --> 4928.879999999999
and yeah yeah and then it's like but I

4927.44 --> 4930.98
don't want to party without a drug yeah

4928.88 --> 4934.179
yeah that's just like the globally you

4930.98 --> 4938.599999999999
just gotta stop doing it

4934.179 --> 4942.08
just stop the stupid machinations

4938.6 --> 4945.38
stop trying to justify

4942.08 --> 4948.14
the missing information

4945.38 --> 4951.679
and just the lack of confirmation for

4948.14 --> 4955.04
your bold belief stop trying to find

4951.679 --> 4957.26
ways to reinforce it in your mind why it

4955.04 --> 4960.8
is a ball after all that's the that's

4957.26 --> 4963.1990000000005
the thing you do that it's done

4960.8 --> 4965.3
she can't can you know I just have to

4963.199 --> 4968.48
have my [ __ ] little ball I can't let

4965.3 --> 4972.14
it go it has to be a wall

4968.48 --> 4974.0599999999995
yeah no but it isn't a [ __ ] ball it's

4972.14 --> 4976.820000000001
flat all the data

4974.06 --> 4979.88
of the very freaking construction date

4976.82 --> 4982.699
of how we got information about things

4979.88 --> 4985.82
all proof it's flat

4982.699 --> 4988.639999999999
you just gotta let it [ __ ] go

4985.82 --> 4991.94
the stupid self reinforcement in your

4988.64 --> 4994.280000000001
mind of reasoning and twisting it your

4991.94 --> 4998.12
way around in order to make it a ball

4994.28 --> 5000.34
again in your mind because it isn't a

you're a [ __ ] [ __ ] flataholic

5018.219 --> 5022.719

5019.78 --> 5024.239
physics and Engineering don't need to

change

5024.239 --> 5030.58
nothing about physics or engineering

5028.48 --> 5034.659
needs to change

5030.58 --> 5037.36
it's all based off the Earth being flat

5034.659 --> 5041.0199999999995
and then a bunch of delusional

5037.36 --> 5043.179
technobabble garbage to try to mask that

5041.02 --> 5045.52
it's all based on a flat Earth and try

5043.179 --> 5047.86
to pretend again for anybody who wants

5045.52 --> 5050.02
to believe it let us know it's actually

5047.86 --> 5051.58
based on the Earth being a ball because

5050.02 --> 5053.38
we're [ __ ] retards we can't

5051.58 --> 5055.0599999999995
technically reason this out she's just

5053.38 --> 5056.46
gonna believe it because you're not a

5055.06 --> 5058.84
flat earther

5056.46 --> 5062.34
it's the same [ __ ]

5058.84 --> 5062.34
it's always the same [ __ ]

5063.58 --> 5068.98
everything is based off of Flat Earth

5066.34 --> 5071.5
because the Flat Earth is the only thing

5068.98 --> 5073.659
that is real the Earth is flooded has

5071.5 --> 5076.78
always been flat everything that's

5073.659 --> 5079.599999999999
measured is based off a [ __ ] flat

based off a flat plane everything that

5083.02 --> 5090.9400000000005
is measured is based off a flat plane

5088.32 --> 5094.38
geometry itself

5090.94 --> 5097.299999999999
is based off a [ __ ] flat plane

5094.38 --> 5099.54
everything is based off a flat plane

5097.3 --> 5102.52
don't you get it you're [ __ ] numpties

5099.54 --> 5105.179
everything is based off a flat plane

5102.52 --> 5105.179
everything

5112.14 --> 5118.659000000001
I've known Engineers I know engineers

5116.56 --> 5120.76
plenty of Engineers and they all say the

5118.659 --> 5122.32
same thing it's all [ __ ] based off a

5120.76 --> 5124.719
flat plane

5122.32 --> 5126.639999999999
you want to justify that there's a

5124.719 --> 5129.699
spherical thing then you can Unleash

5126.64 --> 5133.06
Your stupid little math tricks and bend

5129.699 --> 5135.28
it all into a virtual ball again but it

5133.06 --> 5138.1
isn't it's not about it's all based off

5135.28 --> 5140.28
a flat plane Everything is Everything

5138.1 --> 5145.120000000001
All measurements

5140.28 --> 5149.0199999999995
all measurements universal statement all

5145.12 --> 5151.12
measurements are based off a flat plane

5149.02 --> 5155.159000000001
yeah it's not just Celestial navigation

5151.12 --> 5159.76
not just map mapping map making

5155.159 --> 5162.179
all measurements are based off a flat

5159.76 --> 5162.179
plane

5172.179 --> 5175.26
chew that down

5176.679 --> 5180.06
and put it in the title

5180.72 --> 5186.52
[Music]

5188.56 --> 5194.219

[Music]

5198.82 --> 5205.62
is it based on a flat plane or off not

all just new on

5209.44 --> 5214.48
yay addendum for the show

5212.56 --> 5216.3
would you know that because that's how

5214.48 --> 5219.879999999999
it's all been

5216.3 --> 5222.88
establishes how all is measured how you

5219.88 --> 5227.26
you click made a system

5222.88 --> 5229.3
yeah you click the 3D

5227.26 --> 5232.860000000001
spatial

5229.3 --> 5232.860000000001
measuring system yeah

5233.04 --> 5241.179
what is X what is X uh a flat plane

5237.88 --> 5243.88
it's all based off a flat plane all

5241.179 --> 5246.58
measurements are based off a flat plane

5243.88 --> 5248.9400000000005
all measuring systems are based off a

5246.58 --> 5253.3
flat plane

5248.94 --> 5255.4
all based off a flat plane because if

5253.3 --> 5257.62
you have to construct something or

5255.4 --> 5260.44
figure something out invent something

5257.62 --> 5263.5
but you're gonna have to do it based on

5260.44 --> 5265.839999999999
reality now won't you because you can't

5263.5 --> 5267.76
construct something

5265.84 --> 5270.219
and then apply it and then have it

5267.76 --> 5274.08
working have it part of engineering law

5270.219 --> 5277.179
or whatever if it's not based on reality

5274.08 --> 5279.4
that's what physics does it's measuring

5277.179 --> 5282.04
and figuring out

5279.4 --> 5284.138999999999
the physical and natural world and like

5282.04 --> 5285.639
the causes of effects and all that right

5284.139 --> 5287.679
and measuring you're going to do

5285.639 --> 5289.6
measuring well it's going to be in the

5287.679 --> 5292.36
real world flat

5289.6 --> 5293.4400000000005
all measurements are based off a flat

5292.36 --> 5294.94
plane

5293.44 --> 5296.62
all of it

5294.94 --> 5299.98
all of them

5296.62 --> 5301.36
measuring itself is based off a flat

5299.98 --> 5303.28
plane

5301.36 --> 5306.219
yeah how do you think that they

5303.28 --> 5309.159
established things like a ruler it's a

5306.219 --> 5310.84
straight stick straight yeah and then a

5309.159 --> 5314.04
slightly curved steak now it's a

5310.84 --> 5317.08
straight stick yeah flat all flat

5314.04 --> 5319.8
measuring itself

5317.08 --> 5324.5199999999995
is based off flat

5319.8 --> 5326.8
flat it's flat you get it yet it's flat

5324.52 --> 5329.38
everything we do

5326.8 --> 5333.900000000001
everything that is created and designed

5329.38 --> 5337.719
is all based on that the Earth is flat

5333.9 --> 5340.0
You [ __ ] Wit nothing is based on the

5337.719 --> 5343.78
Earth being a ball nothing

5340.0 --> 5345.58
only your stupid CGI fisheye lens

5343.78 --> 5349.54
[ __ ]

5345.58 --> 5351.46
space fantasy reinforcing Guilds of

5349.54 --> 5353.98
Hollywood and NASA

5351.46 --> 5356.7390000000005
that's the only thing where there is

5353.98 --> 5359.138999999999
some kind of visual that might tell you

5356.739 --> 5360.638999999999
it's a ball and even then if you have a

5359.139 --> 5362.92
half a brain you could look straight

5360.639 --> 5365.4400000000005
through that how they did that and then

5362.92 --> 5366.639
conclude that everything that they've

5365.44 --> 5369.879999999999
shown you

5366.639 --> 5372.28
is bit bent stuff and it's all based off

5369.88 --> 5373.84
a flat plate oh you have a 3D model of

5372.28 --> 5375.5199999999995
earth oh guess what how that's been

5373.84 --> 5378.04
established yeah it's based off a flat

5375.52 --> 5379.900000000001
plane yeah oh you're taking a photo of

5378.04 --> 5382.239
the Horizon it's all bent with the

5379.9 --> 5383.98
fisheye lens yeah you know what

5382.239 --> 5386.5599999999995
fisheye Lance

5383.98 --> 5388.299999999999
you unbend that you can do that you can

5386.56 --> 5390.580000000001
even do that like in Photoshop

5388.3 --> 5393.400000000001
apparently or something like that guess

5390.58 --> 5396.34
what you're gonna see a flat plane it's

5393.4 --> 5399.099999999999
all based off a flat plane everything is

5396.34 --> 5403.12
based off a flat plane measuring

5399.1 --> 5404.860000000001
knowledge all things are based off a

5403.12 --> 5409.96
flat plane

5404.86 --> 5413.0199999999995
yeah Euclid based off a flat plane map

5409.96 --> 5416.86
making Celestial navigation based off a

5413.02 --> 5421.179
flat plane architecture based on a flat

5416.86 --> 5424.0599999999995
plane literally based on a flat plane

5421.179 --> 5427.06
everything is based on a flat plane you

5424.06 --> 5430.8
get it dumbasses ball tards everything

5427.06 --> 5430.8
is based on a flat plane

5433.14 --> 5436.339
[Music]

5438.4 --> 5442.62
project for me Fundy [ __ ]

5443.46 --> 5449.88
it's all based on a flat plane

5446.62 --> 5449.88
everything is

5454.06 --> 5458.679
yeah

5455.679 --> 5460.96
you know your lovely computer games ah

5458.679 --> 5462.6990000000005
oh all these 3D Shooters oh they're so

5460.96 --> 5463.78
realistic you can make it look super

5462.699 --> 5466.12
real

5463.78 --> 5469.0
uh how do you do how do you make it look

5466.12 --> 5470.5
so super real well we take the

5469.0 --> 5472.26
environment

5470.5 --> 5475.6
which is a

5472.26 --> 5478.42
flat plane

5475.6 --> 5481.3
and then we fill in the props and then

5478.42 --> 5483.1
have the background be exactly like the

5481.3 --> 5486.34
real world

5483.1 --> 5489.46
on a flat plane and then you're playing

5486.34 --> 5493.2390000000005
the game it's like wow this looks so

5489.46 --> 5499.679
real you know why because it's based on

5493.239 --> 5499.678999999999
a flat plane yeah [ __ ] that's why

5508.78 --> 5511.96
[Music]

5519.34 --> 5524.159000000001
right so hope you guys enjoyed that show

5526.139 --> 5531.82
baller gimps one need to get whipped

5529.36 --> 5533.86
again so they remember that they have

5531.82 --> 5535.719
feelings

5533.86 --> 5538.0
because they can generally feel the

5535.719 --> 5540.82
globe hey we could only feel the globe

5538.0 --> 5542.62
please Arwin whip us into shape

5540.82 --> 5545.259999999999
with your whip

5542.62 --> 5547.179
because we're gimps and we like to get

5545.26 --> 5549.159000000001
smacked around because we're too [ __ ]

5547.179 --> 5552.82
delusional to realize that everything

5549.159 --> 5555.219
that is real is based off a flat plane

5552.82 --> 5557.08
so we need you to whip us because we're

5555.219 --> 5560.08
gimps

5557.08 --> 5561.82
need to be whipped with truth because

5560.08 --> 5564.34
you can't get it through your thick

5561.82 --> 5567.34
[ __ ] skull

5564.34 --> 5567.34
foreign

5570.58 --> 5576.76
yeah everything's based off a flat plane

5573.04 --> 5579.219
Everything is Everything measurements

5576.76 --> 5581.02
itself architecture

5579.219 --> 5583.9
navigation

5581.02 --> 5586.5
uh everything

5583.9 --> 5586.5
everything

5587.28 --> 5593.12
is based on a flat plane

5590.98 --> 5595.08
huh

5593.12 --> 5598.0599999999995
[Music]

5595.08 --> 5601.0
but our presuppositions but our

5598.06 --> 5603.88
presuppositions prove the contrary if we

5601.0 --> 5605.139
presuppose them or when you don't know

5603.88 --> 5607.54
what you're talking about we can

5605.139 --> 5609.46
presuppose that things are spherical and

5607.54 --> 5612.04
then if you go with that presupposition

5609.46 --> 5613.659
well then you can argue it's spherical

5612.04 --> 5616.06
yeah

5613.659 --> 5617.5599999999995
but it's all based on a flat plane

5616.06 --> 5620.080000000001
though so it doesn't really matter what

5617.56 --> 5623.080000000001
you presuppose right because it's the

5620.08 --> 5626.26
actual measured things are all based on

5623.08 --> 5628.12
the flat plane so yeah presuppose it's a

5626.26 --> 5629.1990000000005
ball all you like it's not gonna make it

5628.12 --> 5630.5199999999995
a ball

5629.199 --> 5633.48
nothing

5630.52 --> 5636.34
that you think is a ball is a ball

5633.48 --> 5638.86
unless you can hold it in your hand and

5636.34 --> 5641.1990000000005
you can feel it's a ball

5638.86 --> 5644.679
well guess what it's probably not a ball

5641.199 --> 5647.799999999999
yeah things you see up there not balls

5644.679 --> 5651.639
think you're standing on not a ball it's

5647.8 --> 5652.78
not a ball yeah only balls are balls

5651.639 --> 5655.0
yeah

5652.78 --> 5657.46
the ground you're standing on not a ball

5655.0 --> 5660.0
things you're looking at in the sky not

5657.46 --> 5660.0
balls

5665.139 --> 5670.2390000000005
basketball manufacturing is not based on

5667.78 --> 5672.58
the flat plane I bet it is

5670.239 --> 5675.759999999999
there's no Factory in this world that's

5672.58 --> 5679.0199999999995
not been designed on a flat plane steamy

5675.76 --> 5681.52
traveler yeah all architecture all

5679.02 --> 5684.76
architecture is based on the flat plane

5681.52 --> 5686.7390000000005
even architecture designed to be on a

5684.76 --> 5689.4400000000005
mountain side

5686.739 --> 5691.0
still based on the flat plane everything

5689.44 --> 5694.599999999999
is you see

5691.0 --> 5697.96
now a factory that produces balls might

5694.6 --> 5700.360000000001
have the product itself being a ball but

5697.96 --> 5702.639
the factory is actually built and

5700.36 --> 5706.259999999999
designed on a flat plane

5702.639 --> 5706.26
because all buildings are

5706.48 --> 5712.62
you see

5707.62 --> 5712.62
you can't there's no spherical Factory

5713.199 --> 5717.099999999999
yeah sure Factory can build spheres but

5715.6 --> 5719.9800000000005
the factory itself is not going to be

5717.1 --> 5722.92
spherical it's not going to be designed

5719.98 --> 5726.339999999999
like a building on a sphere

5722.92 --> 5729.34
nothing is it's all designed to be on a

5726.34 --> 5731.92
flat plane because the Earth is flat and

5729.34 --> 5734.4400000000005
if you design it like it's on a ball

5731.92 --> 5736.12
it's not gonna stand the test of time

5734.44 --> 5738.04
it's going to collapse it's going to be

5736.12 --> 5740.32
weak it's going to be incomplete it's

5738.04 --> 5744.639
going to be warped because the Earth is

5740.32 --> 5746.44
flat and you can only build buildings

5744.639 --> 5749.4400000000005
that are

5746.44 --> 5752.86
on a flat plane that's how Building

5749.44 --> 5755.138999999999
architecture Works they don't build on a

5752.86 --> 5757.599999999999
spherical surface they don't design it

5755.139 --> 5761.46
like that it doesn't work like that all

5757.6 --> 5761.46
buildings are designed on a flat plane

5761.88 --> 5766.42
all right

5764.08 --> 5769.0599999999995
but uh yeah I could Hammer this another

5766.42 --> 5771.04
two hours and then the numpty's in chat

5769.06 --> 5773.9800000000005
will still be venting and just

5771.04 --> 5776.62
projecting the [ __ ] out of whatever

5773.98 --> 5779.08
they're thinking will justify what is

5776.62 --> 5781.12
this fear after all damn it

5779.08 --> 5782.92
it is a sphere it doesn't matter that

5781.12 --> 5785.739
everything is based on the flat plane

5782.92 --> 5788.02
everything everything it doesn't matter

5785.739 --> 5789.638999999999
it still is fear damn it because I could

5788.02 --> 5791.26
say it's a sphere and then hopefully

5789.639 --> 5793.6
I'll forget everything that you just

5791.26 --> 5796.2390000000005
said or when

5793.6 --> 5798.76
I could just drown out your words with

5796.239 --> 5801.759999999999
my stupid comments in the chat and then

5798.76 --> 5803.4400000000005
hopefully I won't remember what you just

5801.76 --> 5806.639
said

5803.44 --> 5806.638999999999
I know how this works

5808.56 --> 5814.0
quickly ask him stupid straw man

5811.239 --> 5816.159
question that'll make him stop no no

5814.0 --> 5821.02
I'll just keep reminding everybody how

5816.159 --> 5823.599999999999
everything ever measured designed built

5821.02 --> 5825.88
navigation it's all based on the flat

5823.6 --> 5828.219
plane every measurement is all

5825.88 --> 5831.34
measurements are based on a flat plane

5828.219 --> 5834.36
I'm just gonna keep saying that

5831.34 --> 5834.360000000001
because it's true

5839.86 --> 5843.639
ball Tarts shouldn't be even allowed to

5842.26 --> 5845.4400000000005
live in buildings

5843.639 --> 5847.12
well you know what Owen says about that

5845.44 --> 5850.12
you know if you

5847.12 --> 5852.96
if you're a guy that goes into buildings

5850.12 --> 5852.96
then you're gay

5854.98 --> 5859.599999999999
so but that has nothing to do with this

5857.86 --> 5861.46
anyway

5859.6 --> 5864.42
I think I'm gonna round out the show I

5861.46 --> 5864.42
think I made my point

5866.8 --> 5871.900000000001
I hope you all enjoyed this show

5870.34 --> 5874.6
I did

5871.9 --> 5876.879999999999
very happy about PayPal makes me more

5874.6 --> 5879.42
eager to actually well just go and do

5876.88 --> 5879.42
this right

5885.159 --> 5892.299999999999
wow somebody sent me a 33 Cent Super

5888.82 --> 5895.12
Chat just to tell me oh I Jose was going

5892.3 --> 5897.46
to help you but then you kicked him out

5895.12 --> 5900.34
go [ __ ] yourself Jose I don't want your

5897.46 --> 5902.26
[ __ ] little stinky [ __ ] money from

5900.34 --> 5905.62
the third world

5902.26 --> 5909.42
I'm rep refunding your [ __ ] PayPal

5905.62 --> 5909.42
stick it up your ass

5909.52 --> 5915.42
don't want your stinky third world trash

5913.06 --> 5915.42
money

5916.56 --> 5920.56
oh anyway

5936.36 --> 5939.599999999999
now what

5942.04 --> 5944.58
oh

5947.26 --> 5950.04
dumbass

5956.139 --> 5958.62
yeah

5958.659 --> 5963.96
take your 33 cents and shove it up your

5961.78 --> 5963.96
ass

5964.659 --> 5968.799999999999
anybody else wants to donate to me that

5966.58 --> 5970.42
would be great I could sure use more

5968.8 --> 5973.78
support

5970.42 --> 5975.52
I mean I I got I I can get through the

5973.78 --> 5980.219
weekend now

5975.52 --> 5980.219
but I mean after that not so much so

5980.98 --> 5984.94
please keep support coming

5982.9 --> 5986.739
that would be great anyway I'm rounding

5984.94 --> 5989.86
out the show

5986.739 --> 5992.08
hope you enjoyed that Global grilling I

5989.86 --> 5993.88
mean I really love I'm probably gonna do

5992.08 --> 5995.62
this more often in the future you know I

5993.88 --> 5998.4400000000005
mean because all measurements are

5995.62 --> 6001.32
actually based on a flat plane like

5998.44 --> 6002.94
everything is you know it and I find it

6001.32 --> 6004.799999999999
kind of amusing to just like yeah no

6002.94 --> 6007.138999999999
everything is based on the flat Lane

6004.8 --> 6010.1990000000005
absolutely everything

6007.139 --> 6012.0
everything that's all based on the flat

6010.199 --> 6014.219
plane all these things all these

6012.0 --> 6017.94
critical things that are that we are

6014.219 --> 6019.8
literally in we're in buildings yeah

6017.94 --> 6021.839999999999
we're on the Earth

6019.8 --> 6024.84
we're moving around

6021.84 --> 6028.08
on a flat plane everything is based on

6024.84 --> 6030.78
the flat plane everything

6028.08 --> 6033.0
and I just love to remember ball remind

6030.78 --> 6034.4
Bob darts about it because they just go

6033.0 --> 6037.679
squirting

6034.4 --> 6038.94
just the balls start bubbling up in the

6037.679 --> 6041.1
rain

6038.94 --> 6042.839999999999
when you say that because everything is

6041.1 --> 6045.620000000001
based off a flat plane and then the

6042.84 --> 6045.62
bubbles just go

6046.82 --> 6053.46
no you got it wrong there's something

6050.34 --> 6056.400000000001
spherical out there really

6053.46 --> 6059.4
yeah but in the meantime everything is

6056.4 --> 6062.159
basically measured off a flat plane and

6059.4 --> 6064.0199999999995
so I just like to remind ball tards

6062.159 --> 6065.28
about it I'm probably gonna do that more

6064.02 --> 6068.400000000001
often

6065.28 --> 6070.739
right anyway thanks everyone for coming

6068.4 --> 6073.679
I hope you like this show if you didn't

6070.739 --> 6075.419999999999

and of course I'm gonna join the Flat

6124.44 --> 6128.4
Earth debates over at Nathan Oakley 9080

6128.4 --> 6132.0599999999995
now

6129.719 --> 6135.4800000000005
I hope to see you there in chat and

6132.06 --> 6138.4800000000005
until the next video keep it flat

6135.48 --> 6141.259999999999
because everything is flat it's all

6138.48 --> 6141.259999999999
based

6162.01 --> 6171.860000000001
[Music]

6168.56 --> 6171.860000000001
damn it

6172.44 --> 6175.678999999999
yeah

6173.88 --> 6177.78
I don't know what the [ __ ] happened but

6175.679 --> 6180.06
for some reason it got muted

6177.78 --> 6182.04
that's really annoying I'm gonna say it

6180.06 --> 6185.04
again yeah I was just mentioning about

6182.04 --> 6187.199
flat keeping it flat it's good to keep

6185.04 --> 6189.119
it flat because everything is based off

6187.199 --> 6190.32
a flat plane

6189.119 --> 6192.42
yeah

6190.32 --> 6195.9
So when you say keep it flat it's really

6192.42 --> 6198.96
about keeping it flat in the mind so

6195.9 --> 6201.96
that your mind is attuned to physical

6198.96 --> 6204.84
reality where everything is based off

6201.96 --> 6207.78
that flat plane that is really there the

6204.84 --> 6210.650000000001
Earth which is flat

6207.78 --> 6241.938999999999
yeah so keep it flat

6210.65 --> 6241.938999999999
