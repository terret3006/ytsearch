right

291.84 --> 299.52
so yeah after that i'm doing

296.32 --> 299.52
where did i get that

307.36 --> 314.47900000000004
i was right well you were first

311.68 --> 316.24
terry 306 but oh yeah you said that

314.479 --> 321.36
nathan wasn't gonna be alive right

316.24 --> 321.36
yeah you were correct indeed you were

323.28 --> 327.919
uh right at some point i got a call

328.08 --> 332.8
a good servant i got a call from my

330.4 --> 335.35999999999996
friend in america

332.8 --> 337.28000000000003
who had a pretty heavy story but

335.36 --> 340.16
interesting

337.28 --> 340.15999999999997
how basically

341.52 --> 346.639
like her boyfriend or well her yeah

344.4 --> 352.08
ex-boyfriend

346.639 --> 354.72
father of her kid had kind of messed up

352.08 --> 355.59999999999997
because he was being very like

354.72 --> 359.84000000000003
psychopathic

355.6 --> 362.24
trying to basically gas light frame her

359.84 --> 363.44
just for control and he messed up big

362.24 --> 365.759
time

363.44 --> 368.16
like he he actually went physically

365.759 --> 370.08000000000004
violent against one of the

368.16 --> 371.84000000000003
people in the government just like that

370.08 --> 373.75899999999996
so it went completely out of control

371.84 --> 375.03
completely spilled the beans and that's

373.759 --> 378.08000000000004
just like an amazing

375.03 --> 378.08
[Music]

378.319 --> 381.91900000000004
like she had been basically enduring his

381.52 --> 385.68
[ __ ]

381.919 --> 388.31899999999996
for four years now and that's like

385.68 --> 390.319
really that's serious abuse situation

388.319 --> 395.36
it's not like

390.319 --> 398.16
like multiple scar level

395.36 --> 399.68
physical abuse but it is with physical

398.16 --> 402.0
abuse still and it's just

399.68 --> 403.84000000000003
psychological maniacal warfare

402.0 --> 405.84
constantly gaslighting getting on the

403.84 --> 407.67999999999995
nerves it's insane

405.84 --> 409.039
right you think trolls in chat can be

407.68 --> 411.759
bad well this

409.039 --> 412.88
was that behavior in physical

411.759 --> 416.47900000000004
face-to-face

412.88 --> 419.36
situations constantly so yeah bad

416.479 --> 420.0
but he messed up and that's like a huge

419.36 --> 423.039
relief

420.0 --> 424.479
it's kind of like the break she had been

423.039 --> 427.199
waiting for

424.479 --> 428.88
to get back control and also to get

427.199 --> 430.16
control over the mind of the child

428.88 --> 432.479
because the child was also

430.16 --> 433.91900000000004
being subjected at a very young age

432.479 --> 434.639
there was nothing she could really do

433.919 --> 438.24
about it

434.639 --> 440.88
and now because of that like she gets

438.24 --> 441.599
it like a little little kid she finally

440.88 --> 445.199
gets it

441.599 --> 448.08
like yeah he's definitely like

445.199 --> 449.12
this she shouldn't be dragged along in

448.08 --> 451.12
some kind of

449.12 --> 453.28000000000003
family mind games because she

451.12 --> 454.08
understands now like yeah this is really

453.28 --> 456.63899999999995
bad

454.08 --> 457.68
like he cannot be trusted because of

456.639 --> 461.28000000000003
this just

457.68 --> 463.039
he's out of control and anyway

461.28 --> 465.919
i'm not gonna smear it all out but it

463.039 --> 469.28
was it was a euphoric moment for myself

465.919 --> 470.79999999999995
like i was like after that conversation

469.28 --> 475.19899999999996
i was like hi

470.8 --> 475.199
like really oh man

476.479 --> 480.4
i was high of that because i had been

479.12 --> 482.24
riding with her

480.4 --> 484.08
on that tension like i've been really

482.24 --> 486.8
rooting for kind of literally

484.08 --> 489.35999999999996
spiritually rooting for her and then to

486.8 --> 492.8
hear that that has finally happened

489.36 --> 496.0
it's like oh what a release so

492.8 --> 496.0
that was pretty awesome

498.8 --> 503.28000000000003
it's really good also to see that just

501.44 --> 505.28
persistence and just

503.28 --> 507.35999999999996
going through the storm that it actually

505.28 --> 511.28
pays off

507.36 --> 513.839
it was just fantastic right but then

511.28 --> 516.56
again this morning

513.839 --> 519.7600000000001
this morning suddenly shitty [ __ ] shitty

516.56 --> 522.8
things started to happen not with her

519.76 --> 525.36
and over here my landlord just

522.8 --> 528.7199999999999
when i was sleeping got in the house and

525.36 --> 531.2
basically just started to

528.72 --> 532.64
pack things in trash cans and then just

531.2 --> 536.399
take them away

532.64 --> 540.0
and that include just like my plants

536.399 --> 542.88
and just stuff that i used that i

540.0 --> 544.16
like that are my regular usage things

542.88 --> 547.04
right

544.16 --> 548.0
and it just did that without asking i

547.04 --> 551.12
literally had to

548.0 --> 554.24
run up to his car before he drove off

551.12 --> 556.5600000000001
to get those plants back there was just

554.24 --> 558.88
yeah those plants that i had been taking

556.56 --> 560.8389999999999
care of so really upset about that i

558.88 --> 564.0
called the police

560.839 --> 566.24
yeah i'm still gonna get a call back

564.0 --> 568.08
because i'm gonna report that because

566.24 --> 570.24
that was totally illegal he basically

568.08 --> 570.24
just

570.64 --> 576.64
vandalized and

573.92 --> 577.12
stole my stuff to throw it away for no

576.64 --> 578.959
reason

577.12 --> 581.36
and you also threatened me like oh you

578.959 --> 585.279
can't have this here anymore it's like

581.36 --> 588.399
no i can so there it's

585.279 --> 589.8389999999999
tensing up and i'm gonna make work of it

588.399 --> 591.76
and i know that i am going to have

589.839 --> 594.0
backing i'm getting backing even just

591.76 --> 597.2
morally

594.0 --> 600.56
from the officer i talk to and

597.2 --> 601.36
from the people of the local government

600.56 --> 603.279
here that i'm

601.36 --> 605.36
gonna get judicial help from so i'm

603.279 --> 606.079
pretty confident in this situation and

605.36 --> 608.8000000000001
in a way

606.079 --> 609.76
it's almost like my landlord's kind of

608.8 --> 613.1999999999999
doing the same thing

609.76 --> 619.8389999999999
as the ex-boyfriend

613.2 --> 619.839
showing himself in the fort hold on

1557.919 --> 1564.0

1561.2 --> 1564.0
interruption

how long did that last but yeah that was

1572.48 --> 1577.84
actually the phone call

1574.559 --> 1580.799

1577.84 --> 1580.799
an appointment

1582.08 --> 1585.1999999999998
and yeah i had to take care of that just

1584.08 --> 1587.52
quickly and she

1585.2 --> 1588.24
was kind of inquiring on the situation

1587.52 --> 1591.36
and

1588.24 --> 1594.159
so anyway sorry for the interruption in

1591.36 --> 1594.1589999999999

him spill the beans and just

1704.32 --> 1711.2

1711.2 --> 1717.44
anyhow but it's like

1713.76 --> 1719.039
i at least i'll end up in a situation

1717.44 --> 1722.0800000000002
that is

1719.039 --> 1724.8799999999999

1729.2 --> 1733.2
nonsense and just leave me alone

1733.279 --> 1739.84
let's see hi

1745.36 --> 1756.0
yes i agree dutch said

1753.6 --> 1756.0
all right

1763.919 --> 1767.8400000000001
all right

1771.919 --> 1776.64
well rufus saint hubbins it's not really

1774.159 --> 1780.3200000000002
easy to find a good place to live

1776.64 --> 1784.0
overall and this is for

1780.32 --> 1794.0
well my needs a really good place

1784.0 --> 1796.88
despite the landlord

1794.0 --> 1799.2
and since i am yeah since i'm living

1796.88 --> 1801.919
here since the beginning

1799.2 --> 1803.8400000000001
i have a natural position that's also

1801.919 --> 1804.48
something i don't really i don't really

1803.84 --> 1808.32
want to be

1804.48 --> 1809.84
the newbie in some new group again

1808.32 --> 1812.72
you know i don't want to have to go

1809.84 --> 1812.72
through all that [ __ ]

1815.84 --> 1819.279
is landlord harass hassling any other

1818.159 --> 1822.5590000000002
tenants no

1819.279 --> 1825.6
not really well he is kind of pushy

1822.559 --> 1827.36
he's just trying to push his authority

1825.6 --> 1829.6789999999999
that everything has to be the way he

1827.36 --> 1829.6789999999999
says

1831.84 --> 1837.84
and some people just go with that and

1834.559 --> 1837.84
others ignore it

1838.559 --> 1841.9189999999999
but yeah everybody that's living here

1840.64 --> 1843.8400000000001
right now

1841.919 --> 1845.5200000000002
that's been living here for a while they

1843.84 --> 1848.72
they get it

1845.52 --> 1848.72
they know what's going on

1849.679 --> 1851.8400000000001
so

1862.399 --> 1866.7199999999998
all right but most tenants here are are

1865.12 --> 1870.399
really just like students

1866.72 --> 1870.3990000000001
so they they come and go

1872.0 --> 1875.279
to most people that get here it is

1873.76 --> 1879.84
really temporary so they have an

1875.279 --> 1879.84
entirely different attitude

1880.72 --> 1884.32
i'm going to talk about the shape of the

1882.88 --> 1885.8400000000001
earth yeah sure

1884.32 --> 1887.84
sure it's just that this was the

1885.84 --> 1890.8799999999999
situation right now

1887.84 --> 1892.8799999999999
that i'm in the middle of

1890.88 --> 1893.919
it's weighing a little on me i might

1892.88 --> 1896.64
have it gained

1893.919 --> 1896.64
three grams

1897.2 --> 1899.919
it's a joke

1900.24 --> 1904.88
can you get social housing oh really

1902.96 --> 1910.3990000000001
yeah

1904.88 --> 1910.3990000000001
no you have to wait literally forever

1911.039 --> 1914.799
they're not gonna put me on some kind of

1912.88 --> 1918.48
priority list

1914.799 --> 1920.399
because i'm just basic you know

1918.48 --> 1922.24
if i'd be registered like oh i got all

1920.399 --> 1925.6
these problems and i need all the

1922.24 --> 1926.799
i'm very special boy i need no help well

1925.6 --> 1929.279
i'm so

1926.799 --> 1931.519
incompetent then maybe yeah maybe they

1929.279 --> 1933.44
would prioritize me

1931.519 --> 1935.6
but i'm not doing that so they're not

1933.44 --> 1936.88
going to prioritize me so it's just i

1935.6 --> 1940.6399999999999
have to get

1936.88 --> 1944.88
there is no system

1940.64 --> 1949.3600000000001
like that it's only for the ultimate

1944.88 --> 1952.0800000000002
weenies that's the only thing it's for

1949.36 --> 1953.4399999999998
or just designated groups whatever the

1952.08 --> 1956.799
priority is of

1953.44 --> 1956.799
the system in the region

1958.32 --> 1963.84
damn stay with my dad no no

1964.0 --> 1968.24
no i tried that before that doesn't work

1971.519 --> 1977.84
like we get on each other's nerves

1987.84 --> 1991.84
but uh

1991.919 --> 1998.0800000000002
right if everything goes right then i am

1994.799 --> 2000.559
gonna stay here for a while

1998.08 --> 2003.9189999999999
and then who knows when hey when a real

2000.559 --> 2005.2
opportunity comes and i can actually

2003.919 --> 2008.3200000000002
afford

2005.2 --> 2009.919
a more serious living space and maybe

2008.32 --> 2013.039
even with a garden or something

2009.919 --> 2013.6000000000001
right next to it i will probably go for

2013.039 --> 2017.44
that

2013.6 --> 2019.039
absolutely but at this time that's not

2017.44 --> 2020.88
an option

2019.039 --> 2022.48
and i'm not just gonna cram myself in

2020.88 --> 2024.72
some new room

2022.48 --> 2026.88
being the newbie with people i don't

2024.72 --> 2026.88
know

2029.919 --> 2033.3600000000001
so i'm just gonna stay here for this for

2032.0 --> 2035.76
the time being

2033.36 --> 2036.799
and we'll see you know the the days are

2035.76 --> 2040.1589999999999
taking away

2036.799 --> 2042.48
just a few more and yeah my financial

2040.159 --> 2044.72
situation may be completely different

2042.48 --> 2047.84
in just a few days i just it will take

2044.72 --> 2047.84
some time to figure it out

2050.32 --> 2061.839
but who knows

2068.72 --> 2073.919
right but you guys want to talk about

2072.96 --> 2089.839
flat earth or

2073.919 --> 2089.839
somebody injected

2090.0 --> 2093.76
