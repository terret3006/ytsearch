64.559 --> 67.92
number thousand and six i'm your host

66.88 --> 69.75999999999999

83.119 --> 86.96
time in the weekend

84.56 --> 89.28
please also do support me through the

86.96 --> 91.759
paypal patreon crypto wallet super chat

89.28 --> 95.2
and the membership system join button

91.759 --> 95.2
that will be much appreciated

96.799 --> 101.2
so yeah

98.56 --> 103.52
not wearing a shirt today

101.2 --> 104.64
because it's bloody

103.52 --> 107.03999999999999
hot

104.64 --> 109.68
out there

107.04 --> 109.68
for reals

110.0 --> 114.92
it's like crystal clear blue sky today

115.759 --> 120.0
like no trails there's planes up there

118.56 --> 122.71900000000001
no trails

120.0 --> 124.64
no persistent trails

122.719 --> 126.64
no left overs

124.64 --> 129.039
there was a lot yesterday though but

126.64 --> 133.2
it's all gone it's just all gone

129.039 --> 133.2
and it's this crystal blue clear sky

133.68 --> 137.68
with just

135.36 --> 139.28
hot

137.68 --> 142.31900000000002
and even the wind

139.28 --> 144.72
which is not really all that present

142.319 --> 148.79999999999998
like when there is a bit of a breeze

144.72 --> 150.4
it's hot too it just carries the heat

148.8 --> 152.959
right at you

150.4 --> 154.959
so it's like really a hot summer day

152.959 --> 157.36
type day

154.959 --> 157.36
poof

163.84 --> 169.20000000000002
all right

165.44 --> 172.319
heat wave don't know if it's like a wave

169.2 --> 175.11999999999998
but it's definitely hot right now

172.319 --> 177.2
hello gadget inspector first in chat

175.12 --> 179.20000000000002
dusty ryder

177.2 --> 183.44
good to see you

179.2 --> 184.64
29 at midnight sheesh

183.44 --> 186.159
i did

184.64 --> 187.35999999999999
it wouldn't get that hot here in the

186.159 --> 188.48
netherlands

187.36 --> 191.92000000000002
it's

188.48 --> 191.92
very rare to get that hot

193.12 --> 198.31900000000002
it's anyway it is 24 degrees right here

195.92 --> 201.44
right now

198.319 --> 201.44
i mean 25.

205.599 --> 211.04
it says here it like it is even

208.4 --> 211.04
gonna go up

211.519 --> 219.799
to 27 according to this prediction chart

216.08 --> 219.799
conjured by google

224.96 --> 228.0
[Music]

226.239 --> 230.08
hello mark

228.0 --> 234.0
doing great

230.08 --> 234.0
return to normal good to see you

234.64 --> 238.11999999999998
matthew hall

246.56 --> 249.64000000000001
all right

254.879 --> 258.32
right yeah matthew hall

256.639 --> 259.6
i don't even call them chemtrails

258.32 --> 260.88
anymore

259.6 --> 263.44
because chem

260.88 --> 265.6
trails suggests

263.44 --> 268.639
like there is

265.6 --> 270.40000000000003
proofable poison being sprayed and that

268.639 --> 272.639
might have happened here and there

270.4 --> 275.12
especially in the past and samples were

272.639 --> 277.28000000000003
taken and ground samples and all that

275.12 --> 280.0
but i don't think that these trails are

277.28 --> 283.35999999999996
actually poisonous i think they're just

280.0 --> 284.96
geoengineering and

283.36 --> 287.44
well

284.96 --> 290.23999999999995
they could have easily found just a more

287.44 --> 293.68
harmless alternative to the original

290.24 --> 293.68
test materials for this

293.84 --> 297.03999999999996
so

294.96 --> 299.03999999999996
i don't know if this was all poison all

297.04 --> 300.32
the time i think we

299.04 --> 302.47900000000004
we'd all

300.32 --> 304.0
feel it a lot more

302.479 --> 307.28
it being done

304.0 --> 309.44
for at least two decades now you know

307.28 --> 313.44
like

309.44 --> 313.44
still a chemical no

313.919 --> 317.35999999999996
why

315.68 --> 320.24
could be dust

317.36 --> 322.8
it could literally be sand dust right

320.24 --> 325.12
naturally sand dust

322.8 --> 326.72
does kind of get blown around and all

325.12 --> 328.24
that

326.72 --> 330.8
or

328.24 --> 330.8
i don't know

330.96 --> 335.19899999999996
it doesn't have to be like a harmful

333.44 --> 339.36
chemical and that is kind of the thing

335.199 --> 342.639
that the word chemtrail does insinuate

339.36 --> 345.28000000000003
through cultural association

342.639 --> 348.24
through the the truther

345.28 --> 350.479
conspiracy theory sector

348.24 --> 353.919
now whether it was like introduced like

350.479 --> 357.36
that to scare us or whether

353.919 --> 359.44
it was really an honest discovery

357.36 --> 362.56
that's up for debate

359.44 --> 365.44
but i don't think they're like

362.56 --> 368.08
over here anyway spraying like seriously

365.44 --> 369.36
harmful chemicals like barium salts and

368.08 --> 370.15999999999997
all that i don't think they're doing

369.36 --> 372.47900000000004
that

370.16 --> 373.84000000000003
we would figure that out

372.479 --> 376.71999999999997
you would like

373.84 --> 376.71999999999997
and everybody

379.36 --> 384.0
especially people like me because i'm

381.36 --> 387.12
very sensitive to that sort of thing

384.0 --> 387.12
very very sensitive

388.16 --> 391.16
anyway

400.56 --> 406.199
planes have to be specially kitted up

411.12 --> 415.52
all right so you seen a video about it

413.12 --> 418.639
did you

415.52 --> 421.35999999999996
and from when was that video and how do

418.639 --> 422.8
you know did you identify the spraying

421.36 --> 426.72
planes

422.8 --> 427.84000000000003
to directly cross reference it

426.72 --> 430.0
and all that

427.84 --> 431.84
or are you just assuming

430.0 --> 433.36
that there is a connection right because

431.84 --> 434.84
hey if there was somebody that would

433.36 --> 438.96000000000004
really want to scare

434.84 --> 438.96
everybody what do you do

439.759 --> 444.0
you make a mock-up plane

442.24 --> 446.479
put a bunch of stickers

444.0 --> 447.68
with chemical hazard and all that on

446.479 --> 449.68
there

447.68 --> 452.319
show it on a video and certainly

449.68 --> 455.199
everybody that knows about trails being

452.319 --> 457.12
left will associate that

455.199 --> 458.88
with it

457.12 --> 462.4
huh

458.88 --> 463.44
chemtrails debunk oreo that's hilarious

462.4 --> 465.919
yeah

463.44 --> 470.8
everything debunks choreos

465.919 --> 470.79999999999995
terrestrial coriolis deviation anyway

476.16 --> 482.8
so yeah gadget inspector unless you've

478.72 --> 482.8
recently been to an air base

483.28 --> 485.67999999999995
where these planes

484.879 --> 487.59900000000005
like

485.68 --> 490.16
that you know like oh look there's one

487.599 --> 492.479
touching down right now and i can still

490.16 --> 494.47900000000004
see some of the trails they left behind

492.479 --> 496.639
in the distance right

494.479 --> 500.0
and then

496.639 --> 501.199
you get up close and you see the tankers

500.0 --> 503.759
in there

501.199 --> 505.199
with the warning label if you've been

503.759 --> 507.12
through that well you probably would

505.199 --> 509.84000000000003
have wanted to film that

507.12 --> 511.52
recently that's another matter then

509.84 --> 514.959
right because then you have like fresh

511.52 --> 514.959
evidence for a reason time

519.2 --> 525.36
part of the geo engineering project

522.479 --> 525.36
from last year

528.64 --> 534.1999999999999
how do you know it was literally filmed

530.88 --> 534.2
last year

534.48 --> 540.16
i mean could be film

536.72 --> 542.88
from 20 years ago that or 10 years ago

540.16 --> 544.56
that they grafted in there and besides

542.88 --> 546.24
well yeah i would not have to know the

544.56 --> 546.959
context

546.24 --> 551.279
so

546.959 --> 551.279
yeah dude keep leaving what you want

561.36 --> 565.6800000000001
and hey i'm not saying that there aren't

563.44 --> 568.399
parts of the world where they actually

565.68 --> 570.4799999999999
do just constantly dump the the chemical

568.399 --> 572.8
hazard [ __ ]

570.48 --> 575.519
instead of what i think is just kind of

572.8 --> 577.12
like a harmless

575.519 --> 579.04
sand dust

577.12 --> 582.519
that they might use

579.04 --> 582.519
in other regions

599.68 --> 606.16
yeah return to normal yeah

603.04 --> 606.16
there's a gary in here

606.64 --> 610.8
suggesting that people here

608.88 --> 611.8389999999999
that are broke show up to get a good

610.8 --> 614.24
idea

611.839 --> 616.6400000000001
did you show up here

614.24 --> 619.839
because you were broke and you wanted a

616.64 --> 619.8389999999999
good idea gary

637.68 --> 641.4399999999999
okay well matthew again the context

640.64 --> 646.24
right

641.44 --> 649.36
if this was this video was just showing

646.24 --> 652.24
like okay look we have official geo in

649.36 --> 655.519
engineering projects this is one of the

652.24 --> 657.12
projects like right not like oh this is

655.519 --> 659.92
one of the standard planes that have

657.12 --> 661.68
been used for 20 years right and

659.92 --> 664.7199999999999
admittedly no if it was just like oh

661.68 --> 667.1999999999999
look here's an official unrolling of the

664.72 --> 669.36
project look got the plane we got it

667.2 --> 672.1600000000001
suited up with the tanks

669.36 --> 674.72
and yeah these are chemicals

672.16 --> 677.519
for this particular test

674.72 --> 681.519
right if it was that then you can't

677.519 --> 682.64
directly link it to the entire web of

681.519 --> 684.079
trails

682.64 --> 685.92
worldwide

684.079 --> 687.279
right because it's officially just a

685.92 --> 689.8389999999999
separate

687.279 --> 694.079
official test project

689.839 --> 698.24
see context context matters everything

694.079 --> 698.2399999999999
anyway hey slow mo moon buggy

698.399 --> 703.12
yeah yeah that was great

700.48 --> 707.2
yeah made by jim bob at another live

703.12 --> 707.2
stream yesterday that was just hilarious

707.839 --> 714.32
and then sean hawkins got in there and

710.639 --> 715.76
well did what he always does

714.32 --> 719.0400000000001
and then

715.76 --> 719.04
jimbo made a voice

719.44 --> 726.9590000000001
created a special little voice for him

722.16 --> 728.639
that to be fair did him too much honor

726.959 --> 731.8389999999999
but i tried to explain it to him like

728.639 --> 734.72
yeah it's very hard to

731.839 --> 739.6800000000001
to really act out the level of stupidity

734.72 --> 739.6800000000001
that sean hawkins is has become

740.399 --> 747.04
everybody that tries to mimic him will

742.32 --> 750.0
always kind of like her natural habit

747.04 --> 751.36
attribute more intellectual capacity to

750.0 --> 753.44
what he does

751.36 --> 754.72
than he actually does

753.44 --> 756.72
and i think

754.72 --> 759.72
jim bob got that but yeah that was

756.72 --> 759.72
hilarious

788.639 --> 792.6800000000001
what return to normal

805.839 --> 809.839
link me up

807.2 --> 813.24
dude i'll link you up

809.839 --> 813.24
i was there

815.04 --> 819.279
but i i did

816.72 --> 821.9200000000001
link jim bob i think i linked jim bob

819.279 --> 824.0
off yesterday here in chat

821.92 --> 829.079
put his link out

824.0 --> 829.079
uh anyway let him let me find him

851.199 --> 854.079
here's the video

855.199 --> 860.399
i think i i

856.88 --> 860.399
i bumped into it

861.36 --> 866.0790000000001
not at the beginning

863.76 --> 868.079
it was already well underway

866.079 --> 871.399
i was kind of distracted by other things

868.079 --> 871.399
at the time

884.399 --> 889.04
does he love remote control cars and

886.56 --> 889.04
drones

890.959 --> 896.079
maybe maybe he just likes simple things

893.92 --> 898.4799999999999
because he wants to be simple because he

896.079 --> 901.04
thinks that the world is just too

898.48 --> 902.8000000000001
complicated

901.04 --> 905.279
and when you look at a remote controlled

902.8 --> 907.12
car or a plane you just know it's so

905.279 --> 909.279
simple

907.12 --> 911.199
right the plane or car doesn't worry

909.279 --> 914.24
about anything it's just

911.199 --> 916.24
responding to the impulses

914.24 --> 918.16
from the controller

916.24 --> 919.839
and the controller is really simple to

918.16 --> 921.76
operate

919.839 --> 923.0400000000001
and you can't forget about everything

921.76 --> 925.279
else and then

923.04 --> 928.399
you can do all kinds of things with it

925.279 --> 928.399
like i totally get it

931.36 --> 933.839
anyway

939.44 --> 943.6800000000001
right i called today's show spirit

941.759 --> 945.6
mechanics volume 2 because i kind of

943.68 --> 947.199
wanted to continue that i don't know

945.6 --> 949.36
though

947.199 --> 952.399
was kind of a gamble

949.36 --> 954.16
that's usually why i don't

952.399 --> 956.32
start out with the title and then

954.16 --> 957.92
halfway the show decide like yeah yeah

956.32 --> 961.1990000000001
it is that kind of a show i am gonna

957.92 --> 961.199
call it but who knows

961.6 --> 967.759
i wanna talk about planes

964.72 --> 970.32
not the streams that's all

967.759 --> 970.32
it's all good

979.279 --> 985.68
right i completely missed out on quantum

982.0 --> 985.68
eraser life by the way yesterday

986.639 --> 990.32
and on mitchell from australia

991.12 --> 997.36
so i was i was watching a movie that was

993.279 --> 1000.16
recommended to me it's really weird

997.36 --> 1002.32
i might have already seen it

1000.16 --> 1003.68
but i think i was really drunk when i

1002.32 --> 1007.12
did

1003.68 --> 1009.519
and that's like troll hunter

1007.12 --> 1011.04
there's a really weird

1009.519 --> 1013.199
movie

1011.04 --> 1014.56
also was kind of complicated because

1013.199 --> 1016.16
like the

1014.56 --> 1018.8
subtitles

1016.16 --> 1023.0
weren't really

1018.8 --> 1023.0
it was almost more like a commentary

1025.199 --> 1030.48
it didn't seem like one-on-one could

1028.079 --> 1032.0
have also been just a bad subtitle job

1030.48 --> 1034.959
but i don't think so there was just a

1032.0 --> 1037.28
lot a lot of sentences in there

1034.959 --> 1039.6000000000001
that were like describing

1037.28 --> 1041.839
like as the movie maker perspective as

1039.6 --> 1043.6789999999999
to like oh i put this in this part

1041.839 --> 1046.8799999999999
together or this is where the video this

1043.679 --> 1049.2
is where there's no more footage

1046.88 --> 1053.3200000000002
and obviously nobody was speaking it was

1049.2 --> 1053.32
a really odd movie

1053.36 --> 1056.1599999999999
it i have

1057.679 --> 1064.0
like it is a real spell it is

1060.88 --> 1064.0
it is interesting

1064.4 --> 1069.919
it does make you wonder like they put so

1066.559 --> 1069.9189999999999
much effort into this

1070.4 --> 1074.16
and like

1072.799 --> 1075.6
yeah

1074.16 --> 1076.64
it was just

1075.6 --> 1078.7199999999998
either

1076.64 --> 1082.4
like really

1078.72 --> 1082.4
heavily envisioned acting

1082.88 --> 1088.24
but like real acting and not like

1085.12 --> 1090.4799999999998
hollywood iconic acting

1088.24 --> 1090.48
or

1090.559 --> 1097.039
yeah or maybe

1093.76 --> 1099.679
maybe it is like partially real like

1097.039 --> 1101.44
most of it is like absurd especially

1099.679 --> 1103.039
like at the end like this

1101.44 --> 1105.28
towering

1103.039 --> 1108.559
what is it like 30

1105.28 --> 1111.76
meters tall freaking troll like really

1108.559 --> 1114.32
out in the open okay

1111.76 --> 1116.64
uh there would have like

1114.32 --> 1119.039
even been like satellite pictures of

1116.64 --> 1121.2800000000002
such things by now if that was real

1119.039 --> 1123.6
right all that

1121.28 --> 1126.8799999999999
so that kind of like broke the spell but

1123.6 --> 1128.6399999999999
it was like really really carefully cast

1126.88 --> 1131.1200000000001
and

1128.64 --> 1133.6000000000001
like there's been like

1131.12 --> 1137.36
it's like made into their own grabbler

1133.6 --> 1140.1599999999999
project almost like they're really

1137.36 --> 1142.6399999999999
they're really casting it

1140.16 --> 1145.52
but it was fascinating and like some of

1142.64 --> 1147.679
these trolls

1145.52 --> 1150.96
you really it really made me wonder like

1147.679 --> 1153.3600000000001
what the [ __ ]

1150.96 --> 1155.8400000000001
like that was either incred like how did

1153.36 --> 1157.9189999999999
they do that in 2010 with special

1155.84 --> 1161.12
effects like how

1157.919 --> 1161.1200000000001
it's just remarkable

1161.919 --> 1165.8400000000001
anyway yeah watch that movie

1171.6 --> 1176.48
i was talking about no not an object

1174.08 --> 1181.039
returned to normal it was not an object

1176.48 --> 1185.76
it was a sighting it was like a darkened

1181.039 --> 1185.76
like a shadow preceding the plane

1187.919 --> 1192.3200000000002
like a

1188.799 --> 1194.4
pen almost

1192.32 --> 1198.559
out right in front of it

1194.4 --> 1198.5590000000002
like i would size up roughly

1199.44 --> 1203.3600000000001
10 to 20 meters

1201.36 --> 1206.84
in front of the nose

1203.36 --> 1206.84
starting there

1211.2 --> 1215.48
but there was no object there

1229.679 --> 1234.96
shadow of the control no no

1232.559 --> 1237.52
no a shadow of the contrail

1234.96 --> 1240.72
doesn't get ahead of the freaking nose

1237.52 --> 1243.2
of the plane that makes no damn sense

1240.72 --> 1245.52
in order for that to happen

1243.2 --> 1246.72
the sun would have had to be

1245.52 --> 1249.52
perfectly

1246.72 --> 1252.24
in relation to that plane's

1249.52 --> 1254.1589999999999
observation position had to be perfectly

1252.24 --> 1256.48
behind it

1254.159 --> 1256.48
that's

1257.039 --> 1261.52
well illogical by heliocentric standards

1259.44 --> 1263.679
of course but even like

1261.52 --> 1266.24
just like really

1263.679 --> 1268.24
no no it would have gone off at some

1266.24 --> 1272.24
point it would have shifted but it was

1268.24 --> 1272.24
just perfectly in front of it

1272.799 --> 1277.679
perfectly

1275.12 --> 1280.08
like it was it was almost it almost

1277.679 --> 1282.64
looked like the plane was going through

1280.08 --> 1282.6399999999999
a tube

1284.32 --> 1288.32
that's the impression that that's not a

1286.24 --> 1289.6
freaking shadow from any light being

1288.32 --> 1292.32
cast

1289.6 --> 1292.32
there's no way

1294.159 --> 1299.48
no no cps makes no freaking sense

1312.0 --> 1317.88
hmm

1313.2 --> 1317.88
watch loose change again wow that's

1319.36 --> 1324.0
yeah i haven't seen that movie in a long

1321.6 --> 1324.9599999999998
long time

1324.0 --> 1328.159
must be

1324.96 --> 1331.3600000000001
really bizarre to to watch it all back

1328.159 --> 1333.679
and realize like how many

1331.36 --> 1336.559
like narratives were in just the

1333.679 --> 1339.6000000000001
sprouting of being set for

1336.559 --> 1341.36
like even alternative media

1339.6 --> 1345.32
which is now kind of the second level

1341.36 --> 1345.32
media narratives

1360.08 --> 1362.3999999999999
what

1367.679 --> 1372.64
what the hell ufo what are you talking

1370.72 --> 1375.44
about

1372.64 --> 1378.0800000000002
dude gary stop freaking spamming the

1375.44 --> 1378.0800000000002
same [ __ ]

1379.36 --> 1383.32
the [ __ ] is wrong with you

1403.2 --> 1408.24
jet fuel hoaxes idiotic how how how

1406.08 --> 1411.799
sofiendo

1408.24 --> 1411.799
how is it idiotic

1454.88 --> 1458.7990000000002
right uh

1457.039 --> 1461.279
man there's a lot of people in chat

1458.799 --> 1461.279
right now

1462.24 --> 1468.279
every cursive man is there too

1464.799 --> 1468.279
jason brown

1488.72 --> 1494.159
how long this thing was in the sky what

1492.48 --> 1497.4
thing gary

1494.159 --> 1497.4
what thing

1512.32 --> 1516.799
are you saying i saw an ufo no no i

1515.279 --> 1519.679
didn't

1516.799 --> 1522.96
why don't you listen to what i described

1519.679 --> 1524.159
it's not a ufo it was a freaking plane

1522.96 --> 1526.32
okay

1524.159 --> 1530.159
i just saw

1526.32 --> 1530.1589999999999
like a weird shadowy

1530.48 --> 1535.039
transparent it's not like there's a a

1533.039 --> 1537.52
black thing blocking anything you could

1535.039 --> 1538.8799999999999
still see through it it's just like a a

1537.52 --> 1542.08
darkened

1538.88 --> 1544.0
our like

1542.08 --> 1545.6
like a cigar

1544.0 --> 1548.08
a half of it

1545.6 --> 1550.559
sticking out of the plane's nose but it

1548.08 --> 1554.1589999999999
even like went around it like it was a

1550.559 --> 1554.1589999999999
little layer surrounding it

1554.64 --> 1559.44
right it went through it

1557.44 --> 1564.4
like over it

1559.44 --> 1564.4
like the plane was inside of a tube

1565.919 --> 1573.679
but it just moved with it constantly

1569.76 --> 1573.679
in perfect succinct lockstep

1575.039 --> 1581.919
wasn't a shadow being cast because then

1577.84 --> 1581.9189999999999
it would absolutely alter

1582.48 --> 1585.799
and it didn't

1586.159 --> 1589.6000000000001
how long was it in your view

1588.24 --> 1591.6
well

1589.6 --> 1594.1589999999999
i've been looking at it for at least two

1591.6 --> 1596.9599999999998
minutes straight

1594.159 --> 1596.96
half the sky

1597.44 --> 1604.1200000000001
i watched until it kind of disappeared

1599.6 --> 1604.12
into the distance behind clouds

1622.24 --> 1627.36
but i've seen other weird things like

1624.799 --> 1628.96
that too and i really cannot explain

1627.36 --> 1631.76
those sightings

1628.96 --> 1631.76
where you would see

1632.08 --> 1636.799
different chemtrails like especially if

1635.039 --> 1638.72
the sky was still very blue and there

1636.799 --> 1641.12
would be just trails suddenly popping up

1638.72 --> 1642.88
all over the place going even crisscross

1641.12 --> 1646.08
through one another

1642.88 --> 1648.96
but then some trails would be

1646.08 --> 1650.32
like dark shadowy like that not like

1648.96 --> 1652.08
black

1650.32 --> 1654.399
dust but just

1652.08 --> 1657.6789999999999
like those trails had

1654.399 --> 1659.76
this shadowy thing about it

1657.679 --> 1662.3200000000002
while other trails didn't and it wasn't

1659.76 --> 1664.24
like one trail was casting a shadow on

1662.32 --> 1665.6789999999999
another or anything it's just like no

1664.24 --> 1668.96
that [ __ ]

1665.679 --> 1672.0
trail is just shadowy and it's so

1668.96 --> 1674.08
bizarre i've seen that a lot

1672.0 --> 1676.48
now not something that i see every time

1674.08 --> 1678.399
there's trails but i've seen like that

1676.48 --> 1680.96
that siding

1678.399 --> 1683.52
at the top of my mind like 20 times in

1680.96 --> 1685.44
the last 20 years

1683.52 --> 1687.279
but it's only really when it's really

1685.44 --> 1689.44
blue clear skies and it's a pretty hot

1687.279 --> 1693.2
day that's when i get to see that type

1689.44 --> 1693.2
of sighting it's really bizarre

1693.52 --> 1699.76
always stood out to me and especially

1695.84 --> 1700.8799999999999
how no [ __ ] body addressed it ever

1699.76 --> 1703.44
and i'm like

1700.88 --> 1707.1200000000001
i'm looking at it look at that what the

1703.44 --> 1707.1200000000001
[ __ ] is that everybody be like

1707.279 --> 1712.559
just walking

1708.84 --> 1712.559
along ah

1716.64 --> 1720.96
right but anyway

1718.96 --> 1723.1200000000001
it's just a weird sighting

1720.96 --> 1725.2
i'm not gonna squirt over it or get

1723.12 --> 1728.32
scared or that kind of nons it's just

1725.2 --> 1728.32
weird it's a mystery

1735.52 --> 1741.2
stop whining gary i'm gonna ban you not

1738.559 --> 1743.6789999999999
in the mood for this whining

1741.2 --> 1745.6000000000001
saw what i saw i don't give a [ __ ] if

1743.679 --> 1747.8400000000001
you don't believe me i'm sorry i didn't

1745.6 --> 1749.6
record it i'm not the only one recording

1747.84 --> 1750.8799999999999
this [ __ ] there's literally video of

1749.6 --> 1753.36
that

1750.88 --> 1756.159
out there where you do get to see like

1753.36 --> 1757.6789999999999
hey this trail is shadowy and then

1756.159 --> 1759.44
people talking about they're like oh

1757.679 --> 1761.76
must be chemicals blah blah blah and i'm

1759.44 --> 1762.72
like this [ __ ] that's not what that

1761.76 --> 1766.919
is

1762.72 --> 1766.919
it's just weird and shadowy

1767.12 --> 1772.9599999999998
i don't know why i i don't even want to

1770.48 --> 1775.6
try and speculate because it's just

1772.96 --> 1778.559
not enough information to to properly

1775.6 --> 1782.559
size it up other than it being data and

1778.559 --> 1782.559
just the impressions of it that's it

1786.64 --> 1791.1200000000001
but yeah the tube the the shadowy tube

1789.919 --> 1792.64
preceding

1791.12 --> 1794.8799999999999
an airplane

1792.64 --> 1797.6000000000001
not the chem the trail it left and it

1794.88 --> 1800.72
did leave a trill did not do have that

1797.6 --> 1803.84
it was just standard white

1800.72 --> 1805.76
that i haven't seen before or if i have

1803.84 --> 1807.52
like once and i would think like this

1805.76 --> 1809.679
has to be some kind of a weird optical

1807.52 --> 1812.72
illusion or something because it really

1809.679 --> 1812.72
did look surreal

1813.76 --> 1819.44
being i have a p900 i just

1817.279 --> 1821.919
it was before the show

1819.44 --> 1824.64
it's quite a hass i'd like for me it's

1821.919 --> 1827.1200000000001
not like oh i see something and within

1824.64 --> 1828.88
10 seconds i have my camera set up right

1827.12 --> 1832.84
it takes some time i don't even know if

1828.88 --> 1832.8400000000001
the battery is still charged

1840.48 --> 1845.3600000000001
i mean i could have done that it's just

1842.32 --> 1848.0
that i didn't think

1845.36 --> 1850.0
i i thought that okay as soon as before

1848.0 --> 1852.64
i have my camera set up it's gonna be

1850.0 --> 1852.64
out of sight

1857.679 --> 1864.3600000000001
dude

1858.72 --> 1864.3600000000001
get the [ __ ] out of my show scumbag

1864.64 --> 1867.44
piece of [ __ ]

1869.2 --> 1873.76
ah a7012 good to see you here

1874.72 --> 1879.72
how am i doing on this warm day well

1876.72 --> 1879.72
warm

1886.72 --> 1890.88
ask about the necklace does have

1889.039 --> 1892.64
significance yeah of course it does you

1890.88 --> 1895.8400000000001
think i'd be wearing something if it

1892.64 --> 1897.279
didn't didn't have massive significance

1895.84 --> 1899.279
i don't wear anything unless it has

1897.279 --> 1902.08
massive significance

1899.279 --> 1905.559
dude i became a goldsmith just to make

1902.08 --> 1905.559
my own jewelry

1906.559 --> 1911.76
but yeah this pendant is

1909.279 --> 1913.08
a slab of pure silver not sterling

1911.76 --> 1917.36
silver

1913.08 --> 1917.36
99.9 pure silver

1917.679 --> 1923.3600000000001
and i carved the flower of life into it

1927.519 --> 1932.6
thanks you two for being a freaking

1929.279 --> 1932.6
minute behind

1934.64 --> 1939.3990000000001
all right so yeah that's what that is

1953.039 --> 1955.919
right

1954.88 --> 1959.679
and it's

1955.919 --> 1959.679
also a medical device

1961.2 --> 1967.519
because silver reacts

1964.799 --> 1969.519
to certain chemicals including that can

1967.519 --> 1972.64
come out of the body right there are

1969.519 --> 1975.76
certain types of acids so if suddenly it

1972.64 --> 1978.72
starts to like get all

1975.76 --> 1980.96
weird looking black even

1978.72 --> 1983.84
i know [ __ ]

1980.96 --> 1984.799
i've got a man i've got a physical

1983.84 --> 1986.08
problem

1984.799 --> 1988.8799999999999
there's

1986.08 --> 1992.24
something happening right like a warning

1988.88 --> 1994.7990000000002
signal and hey

1992.24 --> 1998.159
things get really bad this is basically

1994.799 --> 1999.9189999999999
my replacement from the old soldier

1998.159 --> 2002.24
tradition

1999.919 --> 2003.279
having always having a silver coin with

2002.24 --> 2006.24
you

2003.279 --> 2009.12
because then if you got wounded

2006.24 --> 2011.44
you could put that coin like even

2009.12 --> 2013.039
under the bandages or you put it in the

2011.44 --> 2016.799
mouth

2013.039 --> 2019.44
because silver is yeah it might it might

2016.799 --> 2020.24
just prevent gangrene

2019.44 --> 2023.44
right

2020.24 --> 2026.24
because of the medical implications

2023.44 --> 2028.0
what silver can do and so this i can

2026.24 --> 2029.76
just

2028.0 --> 2033.12
put it in there

2029.76 --> 2035.84
and i got pure silver right there it's

2033.12 --> 2039.12
not any copper or whatever

2035.84 --> 2041.6789999999999
chemical residue there was no soldering

2039.12 --> 2045.4399999999998
of this material at all it is as pure as

2041.679 --> 2048.399
it comes it is exactly as it was

2045.44 --> 2048.399
uh cast

2050.8 --> 2055.679
right so yeah this is a medical device

2059.599 --> 2063.839
silver goes black nothing to oh

2062.72 --> 2065.6789999999996
no

2063.839 --> 2068.72
no you didn't seem to pay attention

2065.679 --> 2072.159
there curdle mosset

2068.72 --> 2072.1589999999997
another sock troll that

2072.399 --> 2077.839
no you didn't listen it's responding to

2075.119 --> 2079.44
acid right the body produces certain

2077.839 --> 2081.839
types of acid

2079.44 --> 2084.639
that's an indication

2081.839 --> 2089.839
that's even considered to be part of

2084.639 --> 2092.0
diagnostic processing huh yeah it is

2089.839 --> 2095.159
because i know about this [ __ ]

2092.0 --> 2095.159
all right

2114.48 --> 2118.16
yeah that's i think so too aries curse

2117.04 --> 2120.4
of man

2118.16 --> 2123.68
i've seen so many things not even like

2120.4 --> 2125.92
ufos necessarily they have seen strange

2123.68 --> 2128.3999999999996
lights though i just didn't think like

2125.92 --> 2130.64
that's not as that's not a ship it's

2128.4 --> 2133.92
it's a weird light thing

2130.64 --> 2138.0
but people don't see it they don't look

2133.92 --> 2140.64
it's like they're afraid to catch on

2138.0 --> 2142.839
that the world is more than their

2140.64 --> 2146.72
oversimplified little easy

2142.839 --> 2148.56
dream right they don't want to know

2146.72 --> 2151.5989999999997
a lot of people

2148.56 --> 2153.92
especially ones that are like really

2151.599 --> 2156.48
invested

2153.92 --> 2159.839
their job

2156.48 --> 2159.839
or in their art even

2163.76 --> 2169.599
or like socializing becoming popular

2166.32 --> 2170.88
they don't they don't pay attention

2169.599 --> 2173.839
because

2170.88 --> 2176.48
what if they saw something

2173.839 --> 2181.32
that would just dispel their own perfect

2176.48 --> 2181.32
little dream that they live in you know

2200.24 --> 2205.4399999999996
all right even walking along right but i

2203.2 --> 2206.48
try to explain why do they do that you

2205.44 --> 2208.4
know

2206.48 --> 2210.32
they don't just do it

2208.4 --> 2212.0
because they're stupid it's because

2210.32 --> 2214.88
they're afraid

2212.0 --> 2215.839
or afraid internally

2214.88 --> 2217.359
that

2215.839 --> 2220.0
what they're doing

2217.359 --> 2223.839
will fall apart

2220.0 --> 2223.839
because it is oversimplified

2224.88 --> 2228.4
right the more

2226.16 --> 2232.72
white noise you effectively graft into

2228.4 --> 2235.44
your life for whatever purposes usually

2232.72 --> 2237.52
earthly based purposes

2235.44 --> 2240.0
the more you will typically start to

2237.52 --> 2242.48
avoid looking around

2240.0 --> 2243.44
with open eyes like a little child sees

2242.48 --> 2245.52
the world

2243.44 --> 2247.68
who actually wants to see everything

2245.52 --> 2249.839
including that

2247.68 --> 2251.2799999999997
what they might not be able to explain

2249.839 --> 2254.16
because they want to understand they

2251.28 --> 2256.96
want to understand what the world is

2254.16 --> 2258.7999999999997
right more white noise you got the less

2256.96 --> 2260.8
you are inclined to pay attention

2258.8 --> 2262.0
because what if the white noise gonna be

2260.8 --> 2266.1600000000003
triggered again

2262.0 --> 2268.16
what if you spot something that is gonna

2266.16 --> 2269.68
mess up what your

2268.16 --> 2274.0
what you believe

2269.68 --> 2274.0
what you think you need to believe

2274.8 --> 2277.04
right

2278.64 --> 2282.839
and we're back to spirit mechanics

2284.8 --> 2291.92
see an orb during the day ah right

2288.32 --> 2291.92
i've seen some of those in my time

2292.079 --> 2294.8300000000004
especially like

2294.56 --> 2296.48
in

2294.83 --> 2299.839
[Music]

2296.48 --> 2299.839
in like wild country

2307.28 --> 2310.6400000000003
yeah the orbs

2309.52 --> 2312.56
like

2310.64 --> 2315.1189999999997
there's like the typical orbs that are

2312.56 --> 2317.2
often said like what no that's just dust

2315.119 --> 2319.359
that's just dust and you're not properly

2317.2 --> 2321.2
zooming in you're right

2319.359 --> 2323.119
some cases might be

2321.2 --> 2325.04
but i bet yeah with some of the behavior

2323.119 --> 2326.7200000000003
like the motion is not

2325.04 --> 2329.52
congruent

2326.72 --> 2330.7999999999997
with inanimate matter floating around

2329.52 --> 2333.04
right

2330.8 --> 2333.04
but

2333.359 --> 2339.44
i always thought like these are

2336.48 --> 2341.839
this that's spirit life

2339.44 --> 2341.839
that's like

2341.92 --> 2346.48
microbes

2344.24 --> 2348.7999999999997
but they're not physical

2346.48 --> 2350.16
they're like primitive life made of

2348.8 --> 2352.8390000000004
spirit

2350.16 --> 2354.48
and it seems to respond like

2352.839 --> 2356.64
microbial

2354.48 --> 2360.48
aquatic setting

2356.64 --> 2362.3199999999997
aquatic setting life microbe life like

2360.48 --> 2363.839
amoeba

2362.32 --> 2367.28
they just

2363.839 --> 2369.92
do stuff they respec they respond they

2367.28 --> 2372.32
bask in energy

2369.92 --> 2374.56
that hangs around and

2372.32 --> 2377.44
certain frequencies of energy and like

2374.56 --> 2379.44
it responds to alteration

2377.44 --> 2382.32
like as a person

2379.44 --> 2384.4
you can like

2382.32 --> 2389.28
get in another mood and that might

2384.4 --> 2389.28
literally disturb them visually

2389.359 --> 2394.359
it all depends on it like yeah

2398.24 --> 2403.359
bright yellow wow okay so it was really

2400.64 --> 2403.359
intense then

2404.48 --> 2406.8
huh

2407.28 --> 2410.48
well let me

2409.599 --> 2413.76
guess

2410.48 --> 2415.52
because i don't know for sure but maybe

2413.76 --> 2418.5600000000004
you just were

2415.52 --> 2420.8
like opensided and you actually saw a

2418.56 --> 2423.2799999999997
remote viewing spirit basically is

2420.8 --> 2423.28
crying

2423.52 --> 2427.92
arcane eye

2424.96 --> 2429.2
as it would be expressed in

2427.92 --> 2431.28
in dnd

2429.2 --> 2433.04
spell mechanics

2431.28 --> 2434.48
because i think that that is actually

2433.04 --> 2435.52
based on something real and it's been

2434.48 --> 2438.72
even like

2435.52 --> 2440.88
worked out elaborately in movies and

2438.72 --> 2441.7599999999998
stuff

2440.88 --> 2444.079
like

2441.76 --> 2446.7200000000003
remote viewings crying

2444.079 --> 2448.8
out of body experiences

2446.72 --> 2452.0
so maybe you just

2448.8 --> 2453.76
were very open to the spirit energy and

2452.0 --> 2455.839
you just saw

2453.76 --> 2457.28
where the consciousness of the person

2455.839 --> 2459.2799999999997
was moving

2457.28 --> 2461.28
and who knows it might have even been a

2459.28 --> 2463.52
dead person

2461.28 --> 2465.28
right that's like

2463.52 --> 2467.119
only in the dream world and they are

2465.28 --> 2468.079
just happen to choose to cry in that

2467.119 --> 2469.76
moment

2468.079 --> 2473.04
for

2469.76 --> 2473.0400000000004
after life reasons

2473.2 --> 2476.96
i don't know

2475.52 --> 2479.7599999999998
but i've always found it very

2476.96 --> 2481.599
fascinating those types of sightings

2479.76 --> 2484.2400000000002
i don't really focus so much on it i'm

2481.599 --> 2485.52
much more concerned with the

2484.24 --> 2487.839
like

2485.52 --> 2487.839
life

2487.92 --> 2490.64
with the living

2493.599 --> 2499.6800000000003
i've been staring at the distance and

2496.079 --> 2501.8390000000004
after life so much that i like i've just

2499.68 --> 2502.7999999999997
gotten signs from many directions like

2501.839 --> 2505.68
hey

2502.8 --> 2506.8390000000004
even my healer says it just literally to

2505.68 --> 2509.7599999999998
me like

2506.839 --> 2512.0
dude remember where you are you're here

2509.76 --> 2514.2400000000002
you have to be in your body you're here

2512.0 --> 2515.04
supposed to be doing things

2514.24 --> 2518.8799999999997
as

2515.04 --> 2520.4
your living self and not just dwell on

2518.88 --> 2522.319
on other things

2520.4 --> 2525.2000000000003
right just

2522.319 --> 2529.2
not dwell on sci-fi even

2525.2 --> 2529.2
and like really lose yourself in it

2531.04 --> 2535.68
or lose yourself in the political

2533.28 --> 2538.3190000000004
struggle too much it's just like these

2535.68 --> 2540.24
are all distractions

2538.319 --> 2542.64
when you're supposed to be doing pretty

2540.24 --> 2545.1189999999997
basic things really in life

2542.64 --> 2546.64
but it does take bravery and decisions

2545.119 --> 2548.6400000000003
and all that

2546.64 --> 2551.64
and there's just so much distraction out

2548.64 --> 2551.64
there

2553.04 --> 2556.4
sometimes you lose track

2556.56 --> 2560.88
then you just dream away staring into

2559.359 --> 2564.7599999999998
the future

2560.88 --> 2564.76
like obi-wan did

2571.2 --> 2575.839
supposedly according to the movie lore

2576.8 --> 2582.4
right because that is basically

2580.079 --> 2582.4
yeah

2582.72 --> 2588.56
how do you explain it

2585.2 --> 2590.0
it's giving up just part of normal

2588.56 --> 2590.88
logos

2590.0 --> 2595.359
to

2590.88 --> 2595.359
get a grip on spiritual things even

2600.319 --> 2604.56
you got to balance it out carefully you

2602.0 --> 2607.76
can't forget you also have to live a

2604.56 --> 2608.96
physical life here

2607.76 --> 2609.92
and you gotta

2608.96 --> 2612.16
like

2609.92 --> 2616.0
you don't have infinite time right you

2612.16 --> 2619.2
can't just spend like 40 years

2616.0 --> 2620.96
studying something and just

2619.2 --> 2623.04
like never

2620.96 --> 2625.359
getting

2623.04 --> 2627.7599999999998
yeah knowing love

2625.359 --> 2630.319
or knowing what it is to like have

2627.76 --> 2631.28
children and not saying that you must

2630.319 --> 2632.4
right

2631.28 --> 2634.7200000000003
but like

2632.4 --> 2637.52
you can want that and still

2634.72 --> 2640.9599999999996
have your entire life be distracted away

2637.52 --> 2640.96
from actually doing that

2644.64 --> 2649.72
and i've actually had that issue

2650.079 --> 2655.28
it's been only more recently like in the

2652.96 --> 2655.28
last

2656.079 --> 2660.5600000000004
10 years that i really started to

2658.0 --> 2662.64
realize like wait i really have to focus

2660.56 --> 2665.7599999999998
on this if i just keep on doing what i

2662.64 --> 2668.7999999999997
do and then ignore it i'm i'm gonna run

2665.76 --> 2671.599
into a debt into a ditch at some point i

2668.8 --> 2674.1600000000003
will be so demoralized that i will lose

2671.599 --> 2677.52
my spiritual grip as well

2674.16 --> 2678.96
i have to build my life too

2677.52 --> 2679.7599999999998
right and it's still in the back of my

2678.96 --> 2682.4
mind

2679.76 --> 2682.4
still long

2683.76 --> 2688.3190000000004
to do all these things

2686.0 --> 2691.319
anyway

2688.319 --> 2691.319
hmm

2693.44 --> 2697.68
unless you're a theoretical physicist

2695.44 --> 2701.48
that you have infinity no no no but you

2697.68 --> 2701.48
can think you have infinity

2710.0 --> 2714.0
what are you talking about matthew hall

2717.52 --> 2723.119
an angel of light

2719.599 --> 2723.119
maybe it's hard to tell

2727.52 --> 2730.4
although yeah

2731.04 --> 2736.079
like angels usually don't really appear

2733.68 --> 2739.2799999999997
even in manifestation form unless they

2736.079 --> 2741.28
have something very specific

2739.28 --> 2744.1600000000003
to do or transform

2741.28 --> 2747.8390000000004
so if just an eventful sighting it's

2744.16 --> 2747.839
usually not an angel in my

2748.48 --> 2752.16
intuitive opinion

2756.8 --> 2759.8
right

2767.839 --> 2772.0789999999997
and we're talking now eve like it's

2769.68 --> 2774.56
separated entities not like humans

2772.079 --> 2778.1600000000003
possess it possessed by angels or being

2774.56 --> 2778.16
guided by angels that's different

2785.119 --> 2790.48
or is it

2786.839 --> 2794.24
this don't know for sure

2790.48 --> 2797.359
like can all these elements be

2794.24 --> 2801.0789999999997
separated from a living vessel and still

2797.359 --> 2801.0789999999997
manifest cohesively

2802.16 --> 2805.839
i've

2803.04 --> 2808.64
never gotten that far with my studies

2805.839 --> 2810.91
really i tried though but then it just

2808.64 --> 2814.0
became apparent like this is gonna be

2810.91 --> 2816.319
[Music]

2814.0 --> 2818.64
like that's inaccessible territory if i

2816.319 --> 2820.96
want to maintain what i'm here supposed

2818.64 --> 2822.0789999999997
to supposed to do right

2820.96 --> 2825.44
would

2822.079 --> 2825.44
risk too much darkness

2826.0 --> 2828.4
because you don't want to [ __ ] around

2827.68 --> 2829.2
with

2828.4 --> 2832.2400000000002
like

2829.2 --> 2832.24
demons really

2833.44 --> 2837.44
you usually just want to rescue people

2836.319 --> 2840.4
from

2837.44 --> 2841.839
the entanglement of demons that's that

2840.4 --> 2844.319
should be the priority if you're gonna

2841.839 --> 2846.72
like go head-on against like the spirit

2844.319 --> 2847.92
essence itself

2846.72 --> 2849.839
yeah

2847.92 --> 2851.839
well let's just see what happens when

2849.839 --> 2854.4
you troll bait

2851.839 --> 2856.48
and like really troll bait really take

2854.4 --> 2858.2400000000002
it personal see that that doesn't really

2856.48 --> 2860.64
work

2858.24 --> 2864.319
but you can't try to basically rescue

2860.64 --> 2864.319
somebody from the grip of it

2864.96 --> 2867.359
anyway

2869.68 --> 2877.2799999999997
troll bait man dude since that movie

2873.68 --> 2877.2799999999997
like trolls and all that

2884.0 --> 2889.92
it is it was really a surreal experience

2886.96 --> 2891.119
watching that movie

2889.92 --> 2893.6800000000003
because it

2891.119 --> 2898.1600000000003
despite everything that i've seen and

2893.68 --> 2900.16
analyzed carefully it still leaves

2898.16 --> 2902.5589999999997
some things to be wondered it's still

2900.16 --> 2906.24
like i can't fully exclude that

2902.559 --> 2908.8
everything about that is fake i did

2906.24 --> 2910.7999999999997
but some things almost must have been

2908.8 --> 2912.96
it's just ah

2910.8 --> 2914.8
but just the idea the suggestion that

2912.96 --> 2917.2
there's like real

2914.8 --> 2919.3590000000004
troll giants that like they're a giant

2917.2 --> 2921.1189999999997
breed and

2919.359 --> 2923.2799999999997
and the mechanics they attribute they

2921.119 --> 2925.599
like medically analyze that like dude

2923.28 --> 2929.2000000000003
they have freaking blood samples

2925.599 --> 2932.079
what the hell is that like

2929.2 --> 2932.0789999999997
makes you wonder

2932.559 --> 2935.28
like really

2935.599 --> 2941.44
freaking troll blood what are the

2938.079 --> 2945.44
genetics of this is like are they

2941.44 --> 2948.319
like human hybrid like what

2945.44 --> 2950.48
there's so much to be

2948.319 --> 2953.48
questioned

2950.48 --> 2953.48
right

2959.119 --> 2963.52
right but that was like literal trolls

2961.2 --> 2965.2
and the movie troll hunter

2963.52 --> 2967.44
about that

2965.2 --> 2969.2
so i'm starting to mix up fields and

2967.44 --> 2970.88
regions and it's going to get too

2969.2 --> 2974.48
chaotic it's gonna be hard to follow if

2970.88 --> 2976.8
i keep doing that i can't just mix up

2974.48 --> 2979.68
metaphysical grounds

2976.8 --> 2984.4
that are not on the same level

2979.68 --> 2987.04
it is tough though right trolls in chat

2984.4 --> 2990.7200000000003
trolls supposed real giants and what is

2987.04 --> 2990.72
the implica if that's real like

2993.599 --> 2999.04
like are they possessed then by demons

2996.4 --> 3002.1600000000003
as like the bible would suggest

2999.04 --> 3005.2
and like in that movie

3002.16 --> 3007.7599999999998
it was like the weirdest thing

3005.2 --> 3010.16
and it was like off-putting but also

3007.76 --> 3012.1600000000003
just like what

3010.16 --> 3014.5589999999997
like oh

3012.16 --> 3016.7999999999997
you can't be a christian because then in

3014.559 --> 3019.599
the presence of trolls will make you

3016.8 --> 3020.559
chant and then they will smell that like

3019.599 --> 3022.96
what

3020.559 --> 3022.96
what

3025.52 --> 3030.079
that's

3027.52 --> 3030.079
like what

3031.44 --> 3035.68
that sounds like

3033.119 --> 3037.92
mythology grafted in but then it makes

3035.68 --> 3039.2799999999997
you wonder like what like

3037.92 --> 3041.04
like

3039.28 --> 3044.1600000000003
ah

3041.04 --> 3045.359
it literally makes me

3044.16 --> 3048.0
dizzy

3045.359 --> 3051.68
thinking about it

3048.0 --> 3051.68
of course it's real oh really

3052.48 --> 3058.16
right yeah yeah but definitely the

3055.44 --> 3058.16
the picture

3059.2 --> 3066.0789999999997
that jose jg drew of me i recognized

3063.04 --> 3068.64
like that troll that was like the true

3066.079 --> 3070.4
one of the trolls really creepy ones the

3068.64 --> 3073.2799999999997
big nosed ones

3070.4 --> 3073.28
in that movie

3074.8 --> 3079.44
i recognized it so

3076.64 --> 3079.44
that makes like

3079.68 --> 3086.0
yeah that makes made the whole picture

3081.599 --> 3086.0
even more into like an honorable tribute

3088.48 --> 3093.119
and hey

3090.079 --> 3094.8390000000004
isn't it funny you know i have a book

3093.119 --> 3098.0
called trolls and

3094.839 --> 3100.7999999999997
tyrants hmm

3098.0 --> 3102.48
i don't know i'm i'm destined to deal

3100.8 --> 3104.6400000000003
with trolls

3102.48 --> 3106.559
so maybe i'm like as just a spiritual

3104.64 --> 3109.5589999999997
troll hunter or something i don't know

3106.559 --> 3109.559
man

3111.359 --> 3114.319
it's getting kind of

3115.76 --> 3120.8
spirit mechanics are getting a little

3117.839 --> 3120.7999999999997
diluted here

3122.839 --> 3126.92
confusing uh

3143.2 --> 3146.96
right yeah that's the right i get the

3144.64 --> 3146.96
joke

3149.76 --> 3155.599
i've been lied to for so long

3153.52 --> 3156.96
well it just made me like the movie and

3155.599 --> 3159.28
the eff like

3156.96 --> 3161.359
the movie effect

3159.28 --> 3164.1600000000003
like at first when they just suggest

3161.359 --> 3167.2799999999997
that like with all seriousness like yeah

3164.16 --> 3169.1189999999997
we can't be christian like not even like

3167.28 --> 3170.079
christian but just like no that's a

3169.119 --> 3171.839
problem

3170.079 --> 3174.6400000000003
to

3171.839 --> 3178.7999999999997
to make it like that is so mysterious in

3174.64 --> 3181.44
a way like is that

3178.8 --> 3184.7200000000003
where part of the

3181.44 --> 3184.7200000000003
pre-flood story

3185.28 --> 3190.0
it's like oh fallen angels they

3188.16 --> 3193.2
interbred with man and then giant

3190.0 --> 3195.839
ferocious giants came out of there

3193.2 --> 3198.64
and they are possessed by the spirit of

3195.839 --> 3201.2
of the devil or the antichrist or i know

3198.64 --> 3204.5589999999997
sorry i'm paraphrasing but you know what

3201.2 --> 3208.0
i mean it's just like okay so

3204.559 --> 3210.8
let's just presuppose for a moment

3208.0 --> 3211.68
that the norwegian trolls are literally

3210.8 --> 3214.319
real

3211.68 --> 3216.3999999999996
and they do actually

3214.319 --> 3218.16
smell out christians and it has this

3216.4 --> 3220.8
weird effect where they just start to

3218.16 --> 3223.839
sweat and chant

3220.8 --> 3224.6400000000003
and then they want to eat him

3223.839 --> 3227.2799999999997
like

3224.64 --> 3229.5989999999997
if that would be real then it's not hard

3227.28 --> 3232.96
to conceive that that is

3229.599 --> 3235.2000000000003
where the original story was

3232.96 --> 3237.68
basically partially based on maybe even

3235.2 --> 3238.72
used to confirm that like yeah yeah yeah

3237.68 --> 3240.48
giants

3238.72 --> 3243.4399999999996
well there's trolls

3240.48 --> 3244.96
they do that with christians so must be

3243.44 --> 3246.0
spirit of the antichrist yeah it makes

3244.96 --> 3247.839
sense

3246.0 --> 3250.96
okay

3247.839 --> 3253.119
makes sense in reference to more ancient

3250.96 --> 3255.76
accounts that they would be like yeah

3253.119 --> 3258.2400000000002
yeah yeah that makes sense

3255.76 --> 3258.2400000000002
i don't know

3258.72 --> 3262.64
i don't know if i'm coming across

3260.64 --> 3264.8799999999997
cohesively it's just

3262.64 --> 3267.2
like in a way that movie just blew my

3264.88 --> 3269.44
mind

3267.2 --> 3274.5589999999997
not being a hundred percent sure like

3269.44 --> 3274.559
how how real or how totally fake it is

3275.28 --> 3281.28
no it's not concave there would be

3276.88 --> 3283.359
curvature if it was concave there in n

3281.28 --> 3286.88
and long distance radar

3283.359 --> 3289.5989999999997
would literally be able to scan every

3286.88 --> 3291.52
surface from a stationary

3289.599 --> 3294.319
ground-based position

3291.52 --> 3296.72
if it was concave because radar can go

3294.319 --> 3299.2799999999997
extremely far

3296.72 --> 3300.9599999999996
extremely far

3299.28 --> 3304.0
and if it was concave that would mean

3300.96 --> 3305.2
you would literally be able to scan

3304.0 --> 3308.079
details

3305.2 --> 3309.5989999999997
including even top down

3308.079 --> 3312.7200000000003
details

3309.599 --> 3315.44
super far distant places if the earth

3312.72 --> 3317.2
was literally geometrically concave so

3315.44 --> 3320.319
it's not

3317.2 --> 3321.9199999999996
got to get over that no curve horizon's

3320.319 --> 3325.119
not geometric

3321.92 --> 3327.04
not spherical not concave geometric it's

3325.119 --> 3330.48
not geometric

3327.04 --> 3330.48
got to get over that curve

3331.76 --> 3335.8390000000004
but you can't because it isn't any curve

3338.78 --> 3341.949
[Music]

3364.799 --> 3369.839
all right oh by the way

3366.559 --> 3371.44
movie intricate intricacy even

3369.839 --> 3374.0789999999997
like

3371.44 --> 3376.2400000000002
one guy gets eaten supposedly

3374.079 --> 3378.2400000000002
suggestively like they never found him

3376.24 --> 3380.799
back in that movie

3378.24 --> 3383.2
like he drops the camera

3380.799 --> 3384.64
you hear him getting dragged away it's

3383.2 --> 3386.48
it's scary

3384.64 --> 3388.0789999999997
whether it's real or not it was pr it

3386.48 --> 3390.16
was pretty scary

3388.079 --> 3392.0
like the sounds these creatures make i

3390.16 --> 3395.2
don't even know like how would you make

3392.0 --> 3398.0
that where'd it come up with that

3395.2 --> 3398.0
including like

3399.04 --> 3405.44
these supposed troll giants had like

3401.559 --> 3407.3590000000004
vibratory abilities you could hear it

3405.44 --> 3410.0
if that is real then they have like

3407.359 --> 3413.359
cymatic powers they can literally use

3410.0 --> 3414.64
sound to just vibrate [ __ ]

3413.359 --> 3418.16
incredible

3414.64 --> 3420.4
that's yeah mind blown anyway

3418.16 --> 3420.3999999999996
uh

3420.48 --> 3424.72
like they get they have to have to get a

3422.96 --> 3426.48
new camera person

3424.72 --> 3428.24
so like oh yeah yeah

3426.48 --> 3430.88
you want to join the team

3428.24 --> 3433.359
like are you christian no no i'm muslim

3430.88 --> 3435.2000000000003
oh okay that's fine

3433.359 --> 3438.5589999999997
okay

3435.2 --> 3440.16
and that just makes me feel

3438.559 --> 3442.6400000000003
that

3440.16 --> 3445.2799999999997
because there is like this history with

3442.64 --> 3447.68
christians right

3445.28 --> 3450.3190000000004
in the far past with norway and

3447.68 --> 3451.68
scandinavia in general and like there's

3450.319 --> 3453.2
been

3451.68 --> 3456.72
like

3453.2 --> 3459.839
christians like being really

3456.72 --> 3462.0789999999997
too dark and inquisitive towards like

3459.839 --> 3464.0789999999997
old religion

3462.079 --> 3465.6800000000003
and

3464.079 --> 3468.559
it's almost like

3465.68 --> 3470.3999999999996
a myth in a sense but is it a myth is it

3468.559 --> 3472.48
or is it a curse that

3470.4 --> 3475.28
maybe these trolls

3472.48 --> 3476.72
are literally like the land's response

3475.28 --> 3477.599
against

3476.72 --> 3479.68
these

3477.599 --> 3481.119
these christian kings or whatever they

3479.68 --> 3484.8799999999997
want were

3481.119 --> 3484.88
against their actions as a curse

3484.96 --> 3489.64
right like that's almost like a myth

3490.0 --> 3495.28
or is it

3491.68 --> 3496.8799999999997
or is it actually real and it's a really

3495.28 --> 3500.1600000000003
deep rooted thing

3496.88 --> 3502.4
that just will not be unrooted who knows

3500.16 --> 3504.5589999999997
i don't know as i said

3502.4 --> 3507.04
my mind was pretty blown by seeing that

3504.559 --> 3509.28
movie in many ways

3507.04 --> 3509.2799999999997
yeah

3509.52 --> 3514.16
so thanks whoever suggested i watch it

3514.799 --> 3518.319
i was really surprised by it

3527.52 --> 3532.64
there is a director's cut is there

3530.4 --> 3532.64
what

3541.839 --> 3548.319
ah right it was you

3545.599 --> 3551.839
well how long is the director's cut

3548.319 --> 3551.839
because i think i might have seen that

3552.799 --> 3556.68
let me look it up

3568.079 --> 3573.8390000000004
all right this one was an hour 43

3570.88 --> 3573.839
minutes

3576.4 --> 3579.44
the one that i saw

3585.68 --> 3588.0789999999997
anyway

3590.16 --> 3593.68
the concave troll

3595.04 --> 3600.839
isn't particularly interesting breed

3597.04 --> 3600.839
that's hilarious tonight

3604.0 --> 3609.72
so i take it concave trolls are just

3606.4 --> 3609.7200000000003
cave trolls

3618.64 --> 3622.96
but apparently there's a difference

3620.24 --> 3624.72
between forest trolls and

3622.96 --> 3626.4
mountain trolls

3624.72 --> 3628.72
i didn't even know there were forest

3626.4 --> 3630.96
trolls apparently according to the lore

3628.72 --> 3635.0789999999997
i don't know it

3630.96 --> 3635.079
dude that movie was crazy

3658.24 --> 3660.9599999999996
darren and

3662.799 --> 3667.04
water fights the lower concave

3664.88 --> 3671.119
extremities of earth that's hilarious so

3667.04 --> 3673.52
what is pulling it to the

3671.119 --> 3675.599
to the outer ends of the concave sphere

3673.52 --> 3677.28
then there and then

3675.599 --> 3679.3590000000004
for which you by the way have no proof

3677.28 --> 3682.3590000000004
because there is no curve inside or

3679.359 --> 3682.359
outside

3689.52 --> 3692.799
allegory of the cave

3693.2 --> 3698.7599999999998
oh god

3695.119 --> 3698.76
yeah that's cute

3700.319 --> 3706.12
pushing it

3702.0 --> 3707.92
gravity oh my god

3706.12 --> 3710.72
[Music]

3707.92 --> 3710.7200000000003
really

3711.44 --> 3715.28
seem to be very ill-informed about

3713.839 --> 3717.92
physics

3715.28 --> 3717.92
there and n

3719.039 --> 3724.88
i'm afraid

3720.48 --> 3724.88
that what you suggest is merely

3725.2 --> 3730.3999999999996
fiction

3727.839 --> 3732.96
there is no gravity there is no

3730.4 --> 3734.4
force and it can't be centrifugal force

3732.96 --> 3736.319
either because then it couldn't be

3734.4 --> 3738.0
spherical it would have to be tube

3736.319 --> 3740.4
shaped

3738.0 --> 3742.24
but still there would be the geometric

3740.4 --> 3745.039
consequences

3742.24 --> 3746.799
right because if it was actually concave

3745.039 --> 3747.92
that would mean that you could

3746.799 --> 3750.72
literally

3747.92 --> 3752.079
use high-powered radar

3750.72 --> 3753.2799999999997
to scan

3752.079 --> 3754.6400000000003
top-down

3753.28 --> 3756.1600000000003
surfaces

3754.64 --> 3758.96
at like

3756.16 --> 3761.92
incredible distances potentially

3758.96 --> 3764.88
hundreds or thousands of miles away

3761.92 --> 3766.4
and because of the concave geometry that

3764.88 --> 3768.6400000000003
means you would literally be able to

3766.4 --> 3771.119
scan things

3768.64 --> 3774.0789999999997
top down almost as if you were taking

3771.119 --> 3778.079
satellite pictures

3774.079 --> 3778.96
because the geometry would just make you

3778.079 --> 3781.3590000000004
go

3778.96 --> 3784.64
scan straight at it right you would be

3781.359 --> 3787.68
able to scan the entire earth realm from

3784.64 --> 3790.0789999999997
any point on the ground

3787.68 --> 3793.48
if it was concave

3790.079 --> 3793.48
you can't

3806.96 --> 3810.76
hello average bear

3821.92 --> 3829.76
the air above the sky bends what

3826.48 --> 3829.76
are you talking about

3834.64 --> 3840.5589999999997
tomonoid please don't tell me you're on

3836.88 --> 3840.559
to this concave [ __ ]

3840.96 --> 3845.52
like all of you guys that actually

3842.799 --> 3849.319
follow me should know better than that

3845.52 --> 3849.319
there's just no way

3855.68 --> 3861.0389999999998
released from it's called relative

3857.359 --> 3864.24
density patio furniture

3861.039 --> 3864.2400000000002
relative density

3865.359 --> 3869.92
right

3867.039 --> 3871.76
the vertical axis

3869.92 --> 3873.28
axis

3871.76 --> 3875.039
direction

3873.28 --> 3878.2400000000002
up and down

3875.039 --> 3881.28
singular direction it doesn't

3878.24 --> 3884.799
change that direction over distance

3881.28 --> 3887.799
it is geometrically parallel

3884.799 --> 3887.799
everywhere

3894.079 --> 3899.44
how does cancer

3896.24 --> 3902.24
no no that's it's not a how question

3899.44 --> 3904.16
patty or furniture

3902.24 --> 3905.9199999999996
it is a what is

3904.16 --> 3908.24
question

3905.92 --> 3910.799
how does it do it i don't know i just

3908.24 --> 3912.5589999999997
know how it works i know exactly how

3910.799 --> 3914.88
things happen in this realm i have all

3912.559 --> 3917.52
that data available to me

3914.88 --> 3919.039
and it we grafted it into the relative

3917.52 --> 3921.28
density theory

3919.039 --> 3923.92
that sleeping war here champions and so

3921.28 --> 3927.119
do i he started it

3923.92 --> 3929.039
i'm ignorant ignorant no no you're an

3927.119 --> 3932.319
idiot

3929.039 --> 3932.3190000000004
and probably a fundy

3933.599 --> 3938.4
i'm not freaking ignorance of physics

3935.839 --> 3941.68
okay that's ridiculous

3938.4 --> 3944.559
i know more about physics than

3941.68 --> 3944.5589999999997
a lot of people

3944.64 --> 3950.48
including fictional physics and

3947.079 --> 3952.48
presuppositional physics oh okay

3950.48 --> 3954.72
in that case hey hey you could have

3952.48 --> 3956.0
debated with me but you had to go to at

3954.72 --> 3959.0
home so

3956.0 --> 3959.0
bye

3965.839 --> 3970.0789999999997
that's not entirely fair i actually went

3967.92 --> 3971.92
to at home too but he would he started

3970.079 --> 3973.92
it

3971.92 --> 3977.7200000000003
and yeah

3973.92 --> 3977.7200000000003
i own this show

3983.359 --> 3988.16
down

3985.2 --> 3988.16
balloon go down

3991.76 --> 3996.0
you wouldn't give him much credit

3994.559 --> 3998.559
well dude

3996.0 --> 4000.0
you can be as greedy as you like

3998.559 --> 4002.3190000000004
you know

4000.0 --> 4005.319
i don't think he needs your credit bad

4002.319 --> 4005.319
karma

4006.559 --> 4011.0
he's gonna get my credit though

4020.24 --> 4025.5989999999997
oh it was right there i know more about

4022.4 --> 4027.76
physics than your average bear

4025.599 --> 4031.6400000000003
i could have said that but that would

4027.76 --> 4031.6400000000003
have sounded kind of silly

4034.24 --> 4039.24
it would be true in all cases though

4051.28 --> 4056.1600000000003
yeah balloons go down

4053.599 --> 4058.4
they don't float forever yeah but why is

4056.16 --> 4060.64
that

4058.4 --> 4062.96
could it be because at some point

4060.64 --> 4064.5589999999997
the helium inside

4062.96 --> 4066.319
leaks through

4064.559 --> 4068.799
the rubber

4066.319 --> 4071.839
because it's so small the particles are

4068.799 --> 4073.7599999999998
so small it kind of leaks through it

4071.839 --> 4076.4
and then yeah

4073.76 --> 4078.48
the density offset of the hole

4076.4 --> 4080.88
the helium inside the balloon and the

4078.48 --> 4083.039
rubber which is much denser than both

4080.88 --> 4085.28
helium and air

4083.039 --> 4087.44
on any level

4085.28 --> 4089.28
like the average density is going to be

4087.44 --> 4091.359
offset to such a level that it's going

4089.28 --> 4094.079
to go down again because the rubber is

4091.359 --> 4094.0789999999997
going to go down

4094.24 --> 4101.04
right it's all about relative density

4097.92 --> 4104.56
is lame no no it's scientifically

4101.04 --> 4107.199
legitimate and confirmed darren n it's

4104.56 --> 4109.120000000001
not lame

4107.199 --> 4111.2789999999995
yeah

4109.12 --> 4114.5599999999995
science is there to

4111.279 --> 4116.719
prove the cause of an effect

4114.56 --> 4119.92
which has to be a naturally occurring

4116.719 --> 4122.319
phenomena that you as the experimenter

4119.92 --> 4124.799
have to manipulate within

4122.319 --> 4126.88
the experiment

4124.799 --> 4130.64
in order to establish the cause of an

4126.88 --> 4131.6
effect in this case relative density

4130.64 --> 4133.279
is

4131.6 --> 4136.159000000001
very easily

4133.279 --> 4138.4800000000005
proven all you have to do is alter the

4136.159 --> 4140.639999999999
density of either the object or the

4138.48 --> 4144.879999999999
medium to show

4140.64 --> 4146.56
the direct effect that happens

4144.88 --> 4149.4400000000005
where suddenly

4146.56 --> 4150.56
this equilibrium is created

4149.44 --> 4153.04
and

4150.56 --> 4155.92
a direct result of that being an

4153.04 --> 4159.56
acceleration accelerated motion of the

4155.92 --> 4159.56
object in the medium

4160.96 --> 4165.6
not real no that is literally real

4164.0 --> 4167.44
science

4165.6 --> 4170.2390000000005
you don't understand what right science

4167.44 --> 4170.239
is numpty

4170.4 --> 4176.799
science is a method you don't understand

4173.04 --> 4178.88
[ __ ] you're a blabbering idiot

4176.799 --> 4181.679
that just copy pastes

4178.88 --> 4184.2390000000005
the biggest blabbers you come across

4181.679 --> 4186.719
you size up on like how

4184.239 --> 4189.599999999999
oh this must be respected i'm gonna say

4186.719 --> 4191.839
that yeah it's wrong you're an idiot

4189.6 --> 4195.120000000001
you're a gullible fool and you don't

4191.839 --> 4195.12
understand what science is

4197.52 --> 4201.56
get the hell out of here numpty

4202.32 --> 4208.04
ugh

4203.679 --> 4208.04
i think we got some trolls here

4225.52 --> 4231.92
less buoyant than air that

4229.84 --> 4233.92
it's not less buoyant it's less dense

4231.92 --> 4237.36
not buoyant there isn't buoyancy has

4233.92 --> 4237.36
nothing to do with it average bear

4241.04 --> 4246.0
i mean that's a description and

4243.84 --> 4249.76
technically you're even wrong because

4246.0 --> 4252.08
helium is actually more buoyant than air

4249.76 --> 4254.56
according to the use of that word so

4252.08 --> 4256.719
you're even incorrect at it

4254.56 --> 4260.400000000001
but it isn't it's less dense that's

4256.719 --> 4260.4
really what matters the density

4261.28 --> 4266.239
volume versus

4263.92 --> 4268.4800000000005
the effective

4266.239 --> 4270.4
well yeah density it's not even mass

4268.48 --> 4272.879999999999
it's not even weight because

4270.4 --> 4275.879999999999
gases don't have mass so it is just the

4272.88 --> 4275.88
density

4298.0 --> 4301.28
why

4298.719 --> 4303.36
does that matter in the face

4301.28 --> 4306.159
to the fact that relative density is

4303.36 --> 4307.239
scientifically proven

4306.159 --> 4310.159
right

4307.239 --> 4311.919999999999
aerodynamics where gases go

4310.159 --> 4315.12
how they mingle how they become

4311.92 --> 4316.4800000000005
inhomogeneous in the big body of gas we

4315.12 --> 4318.239
know as

4316.48 --> 4320.48
the air out there

4318.239 --> 4322.879999999999
has absolutely no relation to relative

4320.48 --> 4325.199
density

4322.88 --> 4326.88
right because it's not contained

4325.199 --> 4329.12
and it's just gonna mix and spread in

4326.88 --> 4332.08
all direction mix in

4329.12 --> 4334.0
and then perhaps it's like i don't even

4332.08 --> 4335.6
know how to prove that

4334.0 --> 4336.64
or how to know it with absolute

4335.6 --> 4339.04
certainty

4336.64 --> 4342.159000000001
but it seems logical that as gases mix

4339.04 --> 4344.88
in with everything

4342.159 --> 4347.759999999999
it's going to spread out

4344.88 --> 4350.96
according to its density in relation to

4347.76 --> 4352.96
all the other gases

4350.96 --> 4356.08
so that the

4352.96 --> 4357.12
much lower density gases would typically

4356.08 --> 4360.08
end up

4357.12 --> 4362.08
on top and the denser gases

4360.08 --> 4364.719
mixed up with the other still

4362.08 --> 4365.76
down below

4364.719 --> 4368.0
but that's

4365.76 --> 4368.0
yeah

4368.8 --> 4374.320000000001
that's just based on my understanding of

4371.36 --> 4374.32
how gases work

4377.679 --> 4381.28
why is there less oxygen

4379.36 --> 4383.599999999999
higher up well

4381.28 --> 4385.44
according to what i just the model i

4383.6 --> 4387.76
just described that i believe how it

4385.44 --> 4390.639999999999
works it's because oxygen is a much

4387.76 --> 4391.679
denser molecule

4390.64 --> 4394.2390000000005
right

4391.679 --> 4396.2390000000005
than a lot of other gases

4394.239 --> 4398.718999999999
just like co2

4396.239 --> 4400.239
is a much denser gas than

4398.719 --> 4402.56
all the other gases

4400.239 --> 4404.159
these are the heavier gases so they will

4402.56 --> 4404.96
be found less

4404.159 --> 4406.5599999999995
at

4404.96 --> 4409.12
at great heights

4406.56 --> 4411.04
because the gas will not have a tendency

4409.12 --> 4413.12
to spread around there as much because

4411.04 --> 4416.4
it's just denser than all the other gas

4413.12 --> 4416.4
i don't know for sure though

4416.56 --> 4422.2390000000005
it should be like that

4418.48 --> 4422.239
it makes sense according to density

4424.4 --> 4427.839999999999
to relative density laws

4432.719 --> 4437.84
but our atmosphere is not layered but i

4435.44 --> 4439.599999999999
never said there's layered gases it's

4437.84 --> 4441.84
always going to spread around and mix in

4439.6 --> 4445.04
right it's just how is it going to

4441.84 --> 4445.04
spread around and mix in

4446.8 --> 4451.04
well no it's not going to separate

4448.96 --> 4454.4800000000005
itself in layers

4451.04 --> 4457.44
but it will try to mix in

4454.48 --> 4460.4
in its region so the denser gases will

4457.44 --> 4462.96
try to mix in

4460.4 --> 4464.0
in the more dense regions which is the

4462.96 --> 4466.88
down

4464.0 --> 4471.92
part of the body of gas

4466.88 --> 4471.92
well the lower dense gases will try to

4472.239 --> 4477.5199999999995
move towards spread around towards their

4475.44 --> 4480.879999999999
region which is up where the lower

4477.52 --> 4483.040000000001
dances lower density layers are right so

4480.88 --> 4485.76
the density layers

4483.04 --> 4488.32
is not literally like gas layers or

4485.76 --> 4489.280000000001
material layers in this case

4488.32 --> 4493.84
it's

4489.28 --> 4493.84
how density orders itself

4494.719 --> 4497.84
less dense things order themselves on

4496.96 --> 4501.199
top

4497.84 --> 4502.56
denser things order themselves

4501.199 --> 4504.96
at the bottom

4502.56 --> 4508.159000000001
that's how it works it's palpably

4504.96 --> 4511.8
provably and repeatably how it works

4508.159 --> 4511.799999999999
every single time

4516.08 --> 4523.159
no no density is not measured of mass

4518.719 --> 4523.159
per volume it's calculated

4525.76 --> 4529.92
take the volume you can measure the

4527.44 --> 4532.0
volume absolutely

4529.92 --> 4535.84
but the density would have to be

4532.0 --> 4535.84
extracted through weighing

4536.0 --> 4542.64
have to be calculated through weighing

4538.64 --> 4545.280000000001
the material and then you cross mix it

4542.64 --> 4548.0
but yeah you got a problem with gases

4545.28 --> 4550.239
when it comes to that you can't actually

4548.0 --> 4552.56
weigh gases because they don't have mass

4550.239 --> 4555.678999999999
while in gaseous state but you could

4552.56 --> 4555.679
still derive

4555.92 --> 4560.719
the density and with it a mass if it is

4558.8 --> 4561.76
in its liquid state right because any

4560.719 --> 4565.12
gas

4561.76 --> 4566.88
can be compacted and turned into liquid

4565.12 --> 4569.44
in a pressurized tank

4566.88 --> 4573.28
so you can still extract the

4569.44 --> 4575.759999999999
effective mass value from the material

4573.28 --> 4578.759999999999
just not while it's in gaseous form you

4575.76 --> 4578.76
see

4584.8 --> 4589.360000000001
yeah there is no atmosphere average bear

4586.88 --> 4591.76
that's an oxygen no

4589.36 --> 4596.159
gas doesn't take the shape of a sphere

4591.76 --> 4596.159000000001
unless it is in a spherical container

4598.56 --> 4601.04
no

4599.6 --> 4604.52
no if you're just gonna chant i'm just

4601.04 --> 4604.5199999999995
gonna ban you

4617.04 --> 4624.08
no they're bothered about you okay fine

4620.08 --> 4624.08
i don't care you don't have to use it

4633.6 --> 4637.92
look if you want to

4635.36 --> 4641.36
keep the sphere in your lingo average

4637.92 --> 4644.84
pair that's that's your issue

4641.36 --> 4644.839999999999
but it is incorrect

4653.199 --> 4656.96
i know it's a very tough one i still say

4655.52 --> 4660.1990000000005
atmosphere

4656.96 --> 4660.199
by reflex

4670.4 --> 4675.04
well sure average bear if it's not your

4672.48 --> 4677.678999999999
issue and you don't mind in the future

4675.04 --> 4680.239
being reminded about it every time you

4677.679 --> 4682.2390000000005
say it by a whole bunch of bears that do

4680.239 --> 4685.5199999999995
realize that it is kind of important

4682.239 --> 4688.08
because it is language wizardry right

4685.52 --> 4690.4800000000005
which is what owen benjamin is all about

4688.08 --> 4693.44
knowing that

4690.48 --> 4695.839999999999
so yeah hey if you're not bothered about

4693.44 --> 4698.239
getting reminded that you're incorrect

4695.84 --> 4699.4400000000005
every time you say atmosphere all of the

4698.239 --> 4701.919999999999
time

4699.44 --> 4704.48
good on you man you want to be like that

4701.92 --> 4704.4800000000005
that's fine

4705.28 --> 4709.239
hello ordinary bear

4723.92 --> 4729.159
what the [ __ ] are you blabbering about

4726.159 --> 4729.159
grendel

4754.239 --> 4757.239
so

4763.679 --> 4767.84
yeah i now return to norm it's very

4766.0 --> 4770.4
tough

4767.84 --> 4770.400000000001
but look

4772.0 --> 4776.88
when you do metaphysical speak or you're

4774.56 --> 4779.280000000001
talking about spirit

4776.88 --> 4781.4400000000005
there's really no objection to drag

4779.28 --> 4783.92
spheres in there right it's just when

4781.44 --> 4785.599999999999
we're talking physics

4783.92 --> 4788.08
that's when you have to kind of pay

4785.6 --> 4788.08
attention

4788.88 --> 4793.6
right because air doesn't take the shape

4791.6 --> 4794.88
of a sphere

4793.6 --> 4797.52
unless

4794.88 --> 4799.52
it is contained within a spherical

4797.52 --> 4802.4800000000005
shaped container

4799.52 --> 4805.120000000001
that's effect

4802.48 --> 4808.839999999999
it's irrefutable i cannot demonstrate

4805.12 --> 4808.84
the opposite of this

4835.679 --> 4839.36
is that a question one photo unit

4842.56 --> 4847.679
what is happens when methane is released

4845.04 --> 4849.6
from the ocean well first off as it

4847.679 --> 4850.96
freaking bubbles up

4849.6 --> 4853.52
right

4850.96 --> 4856.88
i don't know if you realize this

4853.52 --> 4861.120000000001
it dissolves in the water

4856.88 --> 4864.159000000001
yeah because gases dissolve in water

4861.12 --> 4866.239
right that's why you put a bubbler

4864.159 --> 4868.48
in your fish tank

4866.239 --> 4871.199
so that the air

4868.48 --> 4873.599999999999
goes through it and dissolves in it and

4871.199 --> 4876.4
that actually brings extra oxygen in the

4873.6 --> 4878.639
water that the fishes need

4876.4 --> 4880.719
you see so if methane is going to be

4878.639 --> 4884.32
bubbling up from the ocean bottom it's

4880.719 --> 4887.8
actually going to dissolve in the water

4884.32 --> 4887.799999999999
a lot of it

4895.28 --> 4902.159
air contains oxygen well yeah sure

4898.96 --> 4904.639
it's in there

4902.159 --> 4907.28
nitrogen in a great amount oxygen really

4904.639 --> 4911.400000000001
is just a trace gas compared to

4907.28 --> 4911.4
well everything else

4927.76 --> 4930.76
okay

4944.159 --> 4947.32
all right

4961.84 --> 4968.04
okay snowbirds

4964.08 --> 4968.04
that's not a bad question

4976.88 --> 4981.28
god

4978.96 --> 4983.92
so if people say tornadoes and star

4981.28 --> 4986.0
rotations are natural phenomenon is it

4983.92 --> 4988.639
not science because they can manipulate

4986.0 --> 4988.639
or vary them

4995.28 --> 4997.5199999999995
well

4998.08 --> 5005.04
they can't very manipulate their cause

5002.639 --> 5007.28
well it all depends on what we had

5005.04 --> 5009.6
it's

5007.28 --> 5011.28
with stars definitely especially with

5009.6 --> 5013.280000000001
the presuppositions of what they're

5011.28 --> 5015.199
supposed to be yeah you can't manipulate

5013.28 --> 5016.8
that

5015.199 --> 5019.199
but like what is the thing you're

5016.8 --> 5022.0
actually trying to prove

5019.199 --> 5025.5599999999995
about it what is the effect what is the

5022.0 --> 5025.56
the actual phenomenon

5036.239 --> 5040.839999999999
right establishing what you're actually

5039.12 --> 5043.92
trying to

5040.84 --> 5047.4800000000005
prove can be a little bit tricky with

5043.92 --> 5047.4800000000005
science right

5064.239 --> 5067.239
so

5093.44 --> 5096.44
hmm

5106.639 --> 5112.719
right so the show has been

5109.28 --> 5115.28
half spirit mechanics in the other half

5112.719 --> 5118.0
it's getting really

5115.28 --> 5121.0
flat earthy physics now i'm fine with

5118.0 --> 5121.0
that

5153.199 --> 5155.839999999999
hmm

5179.28 --> 5184.5599999999995
yeah unfortunately robber rachel who

5182.4 --> 5186.4
comes with a name like that

5184.56 --> 5189.360000000001
is correct

5186.4 --> 5192.5599999999995
less psi does mean less air it's the air

5189.36 --> 5192.5599999999995
that causes the pressure

5193.52 --> 5198.0
so yeah there is a gradient there is

5195.6 --> 5199.4400000000005
less air there

5198.0 --> 5202.56
and

5199.44 --> 5204.638999999999
lower density gases do have a tendency

5202.56 --> 5206.88
to kind of

5204.639 --> 5209.28
seek higher grounds compared to the high

5206.88 --> 5212.159000000001
density gases

5209.28 --> 5215.28
but in the homogeneous mass of it all

5212.159 --> 5217.04
mesh of it all

5215.28 --> 5218.88
but yeah there is a gradient and the

5217.04 --> 5221.44
gradient is not caused by relative

5218.88 --> 5221.4400000000005
density

5221.679 --> 5226.2390000000005
because that's not what density relative

5223.44 --> 5226.239
density does

5228.719 --> 5231.679
it doesn't

5230.48 --> 5235.36
like

5231.679 --> 5237.52
create lower or higher pressure

5235.36 --> 5239.5199999999995
in its dynamic it just causes this

5237.52 --> 5242.2390000000005
equilibrium

5239.52 --> 5244.2390000000005
when an object is not

5242.239 --> 5246.718999999999
in density equilibrium with its

5244.239 --> 5248.959999999999
surrounding that's it

5246.719 --> 5250.8
all right so there is a gradient but and

5248.96 --> 5253.84
this gradient is not caused by relative

5250.8 --> 5256.08
density the only alternative that i can

5253.84 --> 5258.719
think of is a temperature influence

5256.08 --> 5261.44
which can be proven here on earth

5258.719 --> 5264.88
demonstrated

5261.44 --> 5267.839999999999
to influence the way gases divide within

5264.88 --> 5267.84
a separated container

5270.719 --> 5276.2390000000005
since that can influence it and we know

5274.239 --> 5277.839999999999
there is an heat

5276.239 --> 5281.04
influence here

5277.84 --> 5283.12
down at the ground

5281.04 --> 5285.679
then it's not unlikely to imagine that

5283.12 --> 5288.96
there's probably a cooling effect or

5285.679 --> 5291.12
element happening way on top perhaps at

5288.96 --> 5293.76
the

5291.12 --> 5295.5199999999995
the container

5293.76 --> 5297.1990000000005
top or whatever it is

5295.52 --> 5299.6
it's cool

5297.199 --> 5301.5199999999995
and then that would perfectly explain

5299.6 --> 5303.84
the gas pressure gradient within the

5301.52 --> 5303.84
realm

5303.92 --> 5311.52
because we can effectively miniaturize

5307.12 --> 5315.5599999999995
that setup to create a micro gradient

5311.52 --> 5315.56
within a separated container

5324.4 --> 5329.92
gases know their own level no they don't

5326.88 --> 5333.4400000000005
know anything they're not sentient

5329.92 --> 5337.36
they just respond am i surrounded by

5333.44 --> 5338.719
gas that is denser or less dense

5337.36 --> 5340.799999999999
and then

5338.719 --> 5343.6
the disequilibrium

5340.8 --> 5346.08
will shift it slightly

5343.6 --> 5347.92
nudge it perhaps as it is while

5346.08 --> 5351.84
spreading in all directions

5347.92 --> 5351.84
constantly mixing around

5355.36 --> 5361.839999999999
that's the only reason i could think of

5357.44 --> 5364.4
why less dense denser gases tend to be

5361.84 --> 5366.96
percentile wise more present

5364.4 --> 5369.759999999999
at the higher regions than the higher

5366.96 --> 5369.76
dense gases

5370.639 --> 5375.4400000000005
so it is only a slight influence

5373.44 --> 5377.28
the relative density of how the gases

5375.44 --> 5381.919999999999
will spread out within the homo

5377.28 --> 5381.92
inhomogeneous mass of all the gases

5386.48 --> 5390.718999999999
keep saying mass of all gases it's the

5388.56 --> 5393.84
mesh mesh

5390.719 --> 5393.84
of all gases

5397.92 --> 5401.4800000000005
as in m-e-s-h

5409.36 --> 5413.199
hello julio papin good to see you

5417.12 --> 5421.5199999999995
water can find its own level

5419.6 --> 5423.6
but that's because water has

5421.52 --> 5426.400000000001
intermolecular bonds

5423.6 --> 5426.400000000001
gas is doubt

5430.4 --> 5435.32
right water doesn't spread out in all

5432.32 --> 5435.32
directions

5439.12 --> 5442.08
it doesn't go up

5446.0 --> 5452.56
how do dance things know which way is

5448.32 --> 5452.5599999999995
down they don't they just do it

5454.08 --> 5457.92
because that is the way it is that's the

5456.48 --> 5460.0
axis

5457.92 --> 5462.4800000000005
the axis of relative density

5460.0 --> 5463.84
displacement

5462.48 --> 5465.759999999999
up and down

5463.84 --> 5468.639
vertical

5465.76 --> 5471.280000000001
we don't know why

5468.639 --> 5473.04
we're not gonna tell you why

5471.28 --> 5478.0
you will never

5473.04 --> 5481.28
know why ever ever ever ever ever ever

5478.0 --> 5481.28
ever ever ever

5481.36 --> 5486.199
but we do know what is

5521.199 --> 5524.0
no

5522.719 --> 5524.96
no

5524.0 --> 5528.239
no

5524.96 --> 5531.6
matter doesn't have senses

5528.239 --> 5534.638999999999
leveled water material does not have

5531.6 --> 5535.84
senses they don't have sensories

5534.639 --> 5539.52
they don't have

5535.84 --> 5541.679
sentience they don't have an intellect

5539.52 --> 5542.719
they just do

5541.679 --> 5547.84
what

5542.719 --> 5547.84
the setting of reality tells them to do

5552.8 --> 5560.0
right water has intermolecular bonds

5556.56 --> 5563.52
and it has like surface tension right so

5560.0 --> 5566.56
it will try to form a uniform shape

5563.52 --> 5568.719
in conjunction with every other piece of

5566.56 --> 5573.0
liquid water

5568.719 --> 5573.0
all liquids do this by the way

5580.8 --> 5583.8
so

5590.639 --> 5594.96
okay no agm that's not the way it works

5596.639 --> 5601.04
sort of

5597.679 --> 5604.0
it does it does require fuel to start up

5601.04 --> 5606.88
the vacuum process though right the

5604.0 --> 5608.719
engine has to get spinning

5606.88 --> 5610.96
once it spins

5608.719 --> 5614.32
it doesn't apparently doesn't really

5610.96 --> 5617.0
need fuel anymore or just minute amounts

5614.32 --> 5619.199
to just give like the whole

5617.0 --> 5621.199
self-perpetuating spinning process a

5619.199 --> 5623.28
little notch to keep it up to speed

5621.199 --> 5625.839999999999
right but it doesn't need to actually

5623.28 --> 5627.28
insert force to keep it like that

5625.84 --> 5630.08
just like a little

5627.28 --> 5632.239
little tiny little notch

5630.08 --> 5633.199
because the the vacuum

5632.239 --> 5634.799999999999
engine

5633.199 --> 5638.0
seems to just

5634.8 --> 5638.0
keep itself running

5639.199 --> 5645.759999999999
hey use your where where's that fuel

5642.719 --> 5648.159
andover fist where is it

5645.76 --> 5650.0
where is all that fuel that they need

5648.159 --> 5652.638999999999
constantly

5650.0 --> 5655.199
really think that like the plane wings

5652.639 --> 5657.6
are completely filled up

5655.199 --> 5661.839999999999
with thousands of liters and with that

5657.6 --> 5663.120000000001
thousands of kilograms of liquid

5661.84 --> 5666.0
that are like

5663.12 --> 5671.32
literally like giant weights hanging on

5666.0 --> 5671.32
the side of that buoyant plane really

5672.4 --> 5674.638999999999
no

5676.96 --> 5684.6
huge gas tanks are a hazard

5680.88 --> 5684.6
a big hazard

5687.36 --> 5691.92
what do airplanes run on well depends

5689.92 --> 5693.119
you know which type of airplane we're

5691.92 --> 5694.2390000000005
talking about

5693.119 --> 5697.04
regular

5694.239 --> 5700.239
smaller sized planes don't have vacuum

5697.04 --> 5702.96
drive engines and those things are huge

5700.239 --> 5705.759999999999
they don't have them in the small size

5702.96 --> 5708.4
so yeah regular airplanes still do use

5705.76 --> 5709.6
gasoline and they still need quite a bit

5708.4 --> 5711.679
of it

5709.6 --> 5714.320000000001
right but they're lighter

5711.679 --> 5717.36
so the smaller the vehicle the less fuel

5714.32 --> 5720.32
they actually need to propel themselves

5717.36 --> 5723.119
these huge jumbo jets

5720.32 --> 5724.96
they could never

5723.119 --> 5727.04
like get far

5724.96 --> 5729.92
being the weight they are if they had to

5727.04 --> 5731.6
just use regular gasoline for their

5729.92 --> 5733.52
engines

5731.6 --> 5734.639
they wouldn't get far because it's just

5733.52 --> 5737.679
too much

5734.639 --> 5740.0
it's too big engines too for regular

5737.679 --> 5744.8
function if it's just a regular and it

5740.0 --> 5747.36
would be way too much fuel consumption

5744.8 --> 5749.92
for that weight so they

5747.36 --> 5751.679
apply another system that uses very

5749.92 --> 5753.1990000000005
little fuel

5751.679 --> 5756.719
the only thing you have to do is just

5753.199 --> 5760.48
spin it up so the vacuum drawing process

5756.719 --> 5764.04
initiates and then it keeps itself going

5760.48 --> 5764.04
seemingly miraculously

5770.159 --> 5773.92
there's no scissors

5772.0 --> 5775.84
dude shut up

5773.92 --> 5777.1990000000005
you're whining about

5775.84 --> 5779.28
there is

5777.199 --> 5784.5199999999995
there is

5779.28 --> 5784.5199999999995
there is vacuum drive engines there is

5785.76 --> 5790.4800000000005
that [ __ ] has even painted it

5788.239 --> 5793.5199999999995
so yeah there is

5790.48 --> 5796.32
perpetual motion

5793.52 --> 5799.84
you don't know that

5796.32 --> 5799.84
you literally don't know that

5805.119 --> 5808.4
right

5806.48 --> 5811.759999999999
one citation

5808.4 --> 5815.36
well how about go [ __ ] yourself

5811.76 --> 5815.360000000001
citation [ __ ] you

5817.28 --> 5820.8
playing that size with that eugene

5819.679 --> 5824.96
engine

5820.8 --> 5828.8
can't fly half around the world

5824.96 --> 5831.44
on on all on fuel it's just that doesn't

5828.8 --> 5834.08
work yeah very mature get the [ __ ] out

5831.44 --> 5834.08
of here [ __ ]

5836.48 --> 5840.199
go fist yourself

5851.84 --> 5855.84
jet engines in f1s

5856.48 --> 5860.4
cars run the same way do they

5861.28 --> 5864.28
whoa

5872.239 --> 5875.638999999999
that's interesting

5882.719 --> 5886.32
about using jet engines in their

5887.44 --> 5889.759999999999
what

5891.76 --> 5895.6
why they have one car well they because

5893.6 --> 5897.679
of fuel they definitely have a lot of

5895.6 --> 5900.159000000001
fuel it's like a fuel tank on wheels

5897.679 --> 5902.4
with a giant engine that's a formula one

5900.159 --> 5902.4
car

5903.199 --> 5908.04
it's just engine

5905.04 --> 5908.04
wheels

5910.0 --> 5917.76
and just fuel tank and like a capsule

5915.36 --> 5919.759999999999
to kind of protect

5917.76 --> 5921.84
whoever's in there

5919.76 --> 5925.159000000001
against sudden impact

5921.84 --> 5925.159000000001
that's it

5935.44 --> 5940.159
why do you think they stopped fuel stops

5937.84 --> 5941.84
what they stopped what are you talking

5940.159 --> 5944.879999999999
about agent

5941.84 --> 5946.56
what the hell are you talking about

5944.88 --> 5949.56
stop pit stops

5946.56 --> 5949.56
what

5955.6 --> 5960.2390000000005
i don't know maybe they just became more

5957.44 --> 5964.0
efficient i mean engine technology car

5960.239 --> 5965.839999999999
engine technology has come a huge way

5964.0 --> 5969.36
that doesn't automatically mean they

5965.84 --> 5971.360000000001
have turbo vacuum drives

5969.36 --> 5973.119
that's maybe a little bit far-fetched i

5971.36 --> 5975.04
don't think that effectively works

5973.119 --> 5978.88
because the vacuum drive

5975.04 --> 5980.4
literally requires massive flow of air

5978.88 --> 5983.679
that's like part of the

5980.4 --> 5986.638999999999
requirement for it to work

5983.679 --> 5989.04
you can't hide a vacuum drive

5986.639 --> 5991.52
because there has to be massive

5989.04 --> 5993.84
influx of air at all time

5991.52 --> 5996.080000000001
also yeah one little part getting in

5993.84 --> 5996.08
there

5996.48 --> 5999.5199999999995
right

5998.56 --> 6001.52
so

5999.52 --> 6005.360000000001
i don't know about this

6001.52 --> 6009.1990000000005
look youtube no no buddy

6005.36 --> 6010.88
i'm gonna look into formula one cars

6009.199 --> 6012.5599999999995
with the presupposition that they might

6010.88 --> 6016.92
have vacuum drives because that's not

6012.56 --> 6016.92
how vacuum drives work

6024.4 --> 6029.759999999999
and i'm talking not about vacuum parts

6027.52 --> 6031.040000000001
in an engine yeah of course they suck in

6029.76 --> 6032.0
air

6031.04 --> 6035.36
but like

6032.0 --> 6036.4
these jumbo jet

6035.36 --> 6039.199
engines

6036.4 --> 6042.239
they have a massive amount of air influx

6039.199 --> 6045.04
that is the thing that keeps it going if

6042.239 --> 6048.5599999999995
the air flux was cut off

6045.04 --> 6050.719
then the effect also stops

6048.56 --> 6053.52
you see

6050.719 --> 6058.639
so i don't see how you can apply that

6053.52 --> 6058.639
caps ajm are you capsing on me again

6062.32 --> 6066.48
yeah

6063.52 --> 6066.4800000000005
that's really cute

6071.28 --> 6074.4
batteries

6072.719 --> 6076.8
batteries

6074.4 --> 6080.159
it's engines it's not a battery what the

6076.8 --> 6080.159000000001
hell are you blabbering about

6083.36 --> 6089.28
you clone thinking giving fuel agm don't

6087.52 --> 6091.1990000000005
talk like that

6089.28 --> 6093.84
you're sounding like a complete

6091.199 --> 6095.678999999999
conspiracy nut case again

6093.84 --> 6097.84
it doesn't matter if you're right or not

6095.679 --> 6100.4800000000005
the way you're presenting this you sound

6097.84 --> 6103.88
like a nut case again

6100.48 --> 6103.879999999999
don't squirt

6106.639 --> 6110.96
yeah

6108.88 --> 6113.4400000000005
have you ever considered they just use a

6110.96 --> 6115.36
lot less fuel

6113.44 --> 6117.199
they just built the engines in the way

6115.36 --> 6119.04
and maybe even standardized it like yeah

6117.199 --> 6120.96
you have to use this level of

6119.04 --> 6123.44
efficient engines because we don't want

6120.96 --> 6125.199
constant refueling anymore

6123.44 --> 6128.08
right maybe they just have more

6125.199 --> 6128.08
efficient engines

6128.159 --> 6135.759999999999
to suggest they don't use any fuel is

6131.679 --> 6138.639
kinda silly it really is

6135.76 --> 6141.52
unless you can literally demonstrate it

6138.639 --> 6143.6
like walk up

6141.52 --> 6146.4800000000005
to a formula one

6143.6 --> 6146.4800000000005
engineer

6146.719 --> 6152.56
and like yeah is this a vacuum engine

6150.32 --> 6155.04
does this use any fuel

6152.56 --> 6158.0
where is the gas tank

6155.04 --> 6160.56
how much gas does it use over time is

6158.0 --> 6163.6
there anything odd about the design that

6160.56 --> 6166.2390000000005
once it goes very fast it uses less fuel

6163.6 --> 6168.0
right engineering specs do you know

6166.239 --> 6169.919999999999
these things or did you just squirt

6168.0 --> 6173.04
again because you saw a couple of

6169.92 --> 6176.04
new nutty over-the-top conspiracy videos

6173.04 --> 6176.04
agm

6180.62 --> 6183.729
[Music]

6184.32 --> 6188.159
yeah where's the specs

6186.159 --> 6192.638999999999
where's the specs adrian where's the

6188.159 --> 6192.638999999999
specs where do you where's your proof

6202.239 --> 6206.239
where's your proof where's the

6204.56 --> 6207.119000000001
engineering data

6206.239 --> 6209.839999999999
yeah

6207.119 --> 6212.639
this is not some secret military

6209.84 --> 6216.56
engineer it's a formula one

6212.639 --> 6219.36
racer engineer for crying out loud you

6216.56 --> 6220.96
can literally walk up to these people

6219.36 --> 6222.5599999999995
what is your issue

6220.96 --> 6228.159
where's the data

6222.56 --> 6228.159000000001
where is the data agm where is the data

6228.88 --> 6232.4800000000005
where's your proof where's the engineer

6230.8 --> 6235.04
explaining exactly

6232.48 --> 6237.599999999999
how they don't use any fuel or there is

6235.04 --> 6239.92
some kind of engineering

6237.6 --> 6241.92
trinket in there that it uses much less

6239.92 --> 6243.6
fuel once it gets going which is really

6241.92 --> 6245.76
what the vacuum drive is supposed to be

6243.6 --> 6247.76
all about so where is your freaking

6245.76 --> 6250.400000000001
evidence

6247.76 --> 6254.320000000001
where's your evidence agm where's your

6250.4 --> 6254.32
evidence you're calling me a clown

6255.04 --> 6258.159
that's your wrench there

6258.32 --> 6261.84
you've been doing so well

6283.36 --> 6289.28
yeah my tantrums

6285.6 --> 6291.84
my tantrums of present the evidence for

6289.28 --> 6291.84
your claim

6292.639 --> 6297.36
present the evidence show us the specs

6294.639 --> 6299.36
show us the engineer interview

6297.36 --> 6303.36
that explains

6299.36 --> 6305.44
how the formula one racing car engines

6303.36 --> 6307.199
don't use fuel anymore and how that

6305.44 --> 6309.44
works

6307.199 --> 6311.678999999999
huh

6309.44 --> 6314.08
you're squirting again you watched some

6311.679 --> 6316.8
video it got you hyped up and you lost

6314.08 --> 6319.119
control you lost oversight again you got

6316.8 --> 6323.0
a little over enthusiastic and lost your

6319.119 --> 6323.0
mind again agm

6336.08 --> 6342.48
i mean i find it fascinating the idea

6339.84 --> 6345.1990000000005
but i'm just not gonna

6342.48 --> 6348.32
let somebody claim it like it is

6345.199 --> 6351.5199999999995
absolute fact with caps

6348.32 --> 6357.04
crying out loud in my chat

6351.52 --> 6357.040000000001
without any inkling of actual evidence

6357.84 --> 6361.28
you're not gonna do that in here

6367.84 --> 6370.08
right

6370.159 --> 6374.799999999999
and if you don't have the evidence but

6372.0 --> 6377.36
you still are really into it right now

6374.8 --> 6379.28
then present it for what it is it is

6377.36 --> 6381.599999999999
something you just saw it really

6379.28 --> 6383.5199999999995
fascinates you but you don't have all

6381.6 --> 6386.0
the data

6383.52 --> 6388.159000000001
maybe i'll go do what you said arwin

6386.0 --> 6390.32
that's a pretty good way to attain

6388.159 --> 6392.159
information about it and actually figure

6390.32 --> 6396.04
out whether it is real or not right you

6392.159 --> 6396.04
could have done that too

6402.08 --> 6406.5599999999995
yeah well cps

6404.4 --> 6406.5599999999995
it's

6407.36 --> 6412.4
oh don't mind if i don't take your word

6410.0 --> 6412.4
for it

6412.48 --> 6419.04
i'd like gift like to give agm a chance

6416.8 --> 6422.159000000001
but yeah after that mouthing off yeah

6419.04 --> 6422.159
you're losing your wrench

6426.88 --> 6433.679
yes average barry has

6430.159 --> 6433.679
agm is a is kind of

6437.199 --> 6441.08
what does he call him again

6444.639 --> 6448.639
what's that bear

6446.32 --> 6450.719
now but it can't compare agent aj look

6448.639 --> 6452.32
he's a good guy but he has periods where

6450.719 --> 6455.28
he just

6452.32 --> 6457.36
loses his mind over his things

6455.28 --> 6460.0
and then he gets way too over

6457.36 --> 6462.96
enthusiastic starts the caps out on

6460.0 --> 6462.96
chats and all that

6464.239 --> 6471.08
but he's been very good and stable very

6466.96 --> 6471.08
very long time so

6474.96 --> 6479.44
but that's why i have to be like this

6479.52 --> 6484.2390000000005
because i can't just say oh that agm is

6482.08 --> 6485.679
going nuts again that's fine no no it's

6484.239 --> 6487.839999999999
not fine

6485.679 --> 6490.0
it does worry me a little right because

6487.84 --> 6492.88
he's been good for so long i hope he is

6490.0 --> 6495.52
not going to regress

6492.88 --> 6498.84
because it could regress badly you never

6495.52 --> 6498.84
really know

6499.52 --> 6502.0
anyway

6502.08 --> 6507.04
uh

6503.52 --> 6507.040000000001
i think i'm gonna round out the show

6510.88 --> 6515.679
all right but average pair who's that

6513.119 --> 6515.679
that bear

6515.76 --> 6519.92
over at owen benjamin's who always goes

6518.32 --> 6522.0
nuts in the chat

6519.92 --> 6524.96
and then owen benjamin just has to ban

6522.0 --> 6528.08
him like 50 times or [ __ ]

6524.96 --> 6530.639
oh ajm is a little like that but just a

6528.08 --> 6535.5599999999995
little agm you're not that

6530.639 --> 6535.56
nutty i know you aren't it's okay

6542.88 --> 6551.04
he had a dream he wasn't no f1 race car

6546.96 --> 6551.04
you know drive maybe maybe he did

6551.92 --> 6556.4800000000005
it's funny because recently i actually

6554.0 --> 6557.76
saw a race car driving because

6556.48 --> 6560.5599999999995
the roommate

6557.76 --> 6560.56
was watching it

6563.84 --> 6566.84
that was yesterday

6566.159 --> 6570.32
no

6566.84 --> 6572.0
wait no that was the day before

6570.32 --> 6574.08
that was sunday

6572.0 --> 6575.599
right it's weird how it all comes

6574.08 --> 6577.199
together

6575.599 --> 6580.0
all right anyway

6577.199 --> 6582.0
