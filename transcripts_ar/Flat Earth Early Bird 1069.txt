112.68 --> 117.92
today weather's quite interesting

118.799 --> 123.71900000000001
there's a couple of big clouds here and

120.96 --> 125.88
there hanging but in between there is

123.719 --> 129.599
some really beautiful

125.88 --> 133.039
Blue Clear Sky

129.599 --> 133.039
like it's washed clean

134.04 --> 139.14
and that's no no surprise to me because

136.2 --> 140.94
it has been raining like the entire

139.14 --> 144.5
night

140.94 --> 144.5
was really a dreary night

144.959 --> 150.9
with a lot of wind too and all that

148.02 --> 154.5
and yeah now

150.9 --> 157.31900000000002
still some big clouds up there but

154.5 --> 160.56
there's also this nice and bright sun in

157.319 --> 164.66
between and yeah there's like ladybugs

160.56 --> 164.66
all over the place all of a sudden

167.7 --> 172.98
so there's some nest

170.72 --> 176.18
breaking out

172.98 --> 176.17999999999998
that happens sometimes

177.06 --> 183.72
and yeah lots of insects are going about

180.2 --> 185.099
and especially when the Sun is bright

183.72 --> 186.959
and there's not a lot of wind you

185.099 --> 187.94
suddenly really see them buzzing all

186.959 --> 191.599
around

187.94 --> 191.599
reflecting the sunlight

192.36 --> 195.739
birds are also at it

201.08 --> 204.62
oh look at that

206.28 --> 209.959
some beautiful sights out there

220.62 --> 224.4
oh

222.36 --> 226.44000000000003
I got a full chat

224.4 --> 228.9
and that was quick hello Gadget

226.44 --> 233.099
inspector first in chat America silver

228.9 --> 236.87900000000002
Patriot iOS G Nathan Oakley 1980

233.099 --> 239.29899999999998
Daniel Robles Stone monkey yeah good to

236.879 --> 239.29899999999998
see you all

239.34 --> 246.06
it is Saturday the 13th of November

243.06 --> 246.06
2021.

246.959 --> 253.31900000000002
you're gonna need R for good sunshine I

249.84 --> 257.239
don't think so get your inspector

253.319 --> 257.239
I don't think you need R for that at all

257.94 --> 260.94
anyway

264.18 --> 266.90000000000003
huh

267.84 --> 270.919
right so

272.52 --> 277.46
pretty good

274.02 --> 277.46
there's still some tension

277.979 --> 282.979
it's just this this period of time

283.979 --> 287.479
but yeah I did have a good rest

288.54 --> 294.84000000000003
uh also before the show I had a just

291.419 --> 297.0
another long nice conversation uh more

294.84 --> 299.4
like a monologue she was hearing me out

297.0 --> 302.22
my roommate who's happened to be staying

299.4 --> 304.25899999999996
for the weekend

302.22 --> 308.16
apparently your boyfriend is coming over

304.259 --> 311.52000000000004
soon so whatever but

308.16 --> 314.06
yeah like she's such a good listener

311.52 --> 314.06
I

315.36 --> 319.68
and I've spotted myself again talking

317.759 --> 322.86
about everything but not mentioning

319.68 --> 327.0
flatter so every time I just like yeah

322.86 --> 329.58000000000004
between our cosmoginy and the opponent I

327.0 --> 331.5
wonder if she actually realizes what

329.58 --> 333.539
cosmogyny really means and the

331.5 --> 335.52
implication

333.539 --> 337.979
I wonder if she realizes I'm talking

335.52 --> 340.139
about Flat Earth but like purposely not

337.979 --> 342.65999999999997
bringing that up

340.139 --> 343.979
because I don't know if he is and I

342.66 --> 346.74
don't want to just throw it at her

343.979 --> 348.3
because if she gets like what what what

346.74 --> 349.38
then

348.3 --> 351.36
yeah

349.38 --> 353.759
like what if she suddenly starts talking

351.36 --> 355.62
to that about that too

353.759 --> 357.06
boyfriend or something and he gets

355.62 --> 360.139
really pissed off I wouldn't want to be

357.06 --> 360.139
responsible for that

360.84 --> 370.08
but yeah she is an amazing listener and

365.58 --> 372.35999999999996
she has a good grip on psychology and

370.08 --> 375.24
group dynamics

372.36 --> 377.539
yeah I don't know I really appreciate

375.24 --> 377.539
her

377.94 --> 385.46
her being around

380.639 --> 385.46000000000004
uh hello Adam meekin good to see you

385.56 --> 391.259
did I watch Brian on Mitch's Channel

388.139 --> 394.139
last night yeah yeah

391.259 --> 396.24
that was pretty intense like there were

394.139 --> 397.8
some anti-flat earthers all over the

396.24 --> 399.84000000000003
chat

397.8 --> 403.319
like even Brenda tried to get in there

399.84 --> 405.85999999999996
but Tony would constantly time her out

403.319 --> 409.02000000000004
and then when he stopped doing that she

405.86 --> 411.8
it started to act like it

409.02 --> 411.79999999999995
terrible

412.8 --> 419.78000000000003
as usual

415.44 --> 419.78
Falling in Love no well

425.4 --> 428.35999999999996
I mean I could

432.56 --> 438.78000000000003
there doesn't seem to be like any gate

435.599 --> 440.639
closing over time between us

438.78 --> 442.55999999999995
that's what I'm noticing so I'm just

440.639 --> 445.34000000000003
going to be patient

442.56 --> 445.34
and

445.38 --> 449.759
God allows it then

447.66 --> 451.02000000000004
maybe I'll get lucky

449.759 --> 453.84000000000003
I don't know

451.02 --> 457.139
I'm not counting on it you know I'm just

453.84 --> 459.9
like if I'm gonna be just a really great

457.139 --> 463.94
roommate maybe a really good friend I

459.9 --> 463.94
don't know that would also be great

467.879 --> 473.40000000000003
but I'm not like gonna go to the friend

471.36 --> 476.41900000000004
zone in that sense I'm not gonna like

473.4 --> 479.75899999999996
okay well since

476.419 --> 482.34
I'm in my mind not seeing her as a

479.759 --> 485.34000000000003
future girlfriend I'm just gonna like

482.34 --> 486.65999999999997
let everything go

485.34 --> 489.9
and

486.66 --> 491.58000000000004
show her like the most vulnerable sides

489.9 --> 495.5
right no no

491.58 --> 495.5
I'm gonna keep my composure in

495.599 --> 498.139
ugh

500.639 --> 505.34000000000003
make sure that gate doesn't close anyway

505.919 --> 510.539
uh

507.66 --> 512.7
it's always good to have a listener

510.539 --> 514.14
right

512.7 --> 516.36
but

514.14 --> 518.159
it's also like a good listener it's

516.36 --> 519.899
tough because there's people that will

518.159 --> 522.18
just let you Yap

519.899 --> 523.68
because they know you got something on

522.18 --> 525.899
your heart and you need to get it off

523.68 --> 528.959
your chest right like that

525.899 --> 532.58
but a lot of the times people then don't

528.959 --> 532.5799999999999
really follow what you're talking about

532.74 --> 538.6800000000001
that's much rarer that that when you do

536.459 --> 540.8389999999999
when you're like throwing it out a

538.68 --> 543.959
complex situation and

540.839 --> 546.4200000000001
personal friction situations

543.959 --> 548.2199999999999
that somebody actually is able to follow

546.42 --> 550.62
you in detail and even give you like

548.22 --> 552.839
good tips or something like I try to do

550.62 --> 555.899
that that's like one of my skills that

552.839 --> 558.0
I've actually learned to do

555.899 --> 559.38
if the circumstances are right if I'm

558.0 --> 561.42
not like

559.38 --> 563.399
stable myself or anything and even then

561.42 --> 565.4399999999999
sometimes it still works because it's

563.399 --> 566.88
not about me

565.44 --> 569.399
but

566.88 --> 571.86
she seems to be pretty talented at that

569.399 --> 574.26
too and it's like yeah I find that

571.86 --> 575.88
attractive yeah

574.26 --> 578.88
haha

575.88 --> 583.2
that's that's the skill I I would like

578.88 --> 586.74
to see in office in my offspring

583.2 --> 588.779
that would be amazing anyway this did

586.74 --> 590.94
already see this what happens if you

588.779 --> 593.42
start fantasizing about it you take it

590.94 --> 593.4200000000001
too far

593.519 --> 596.0
I

596.1 --> 598.58
anyway

602.339 --> 606.12
uh Jeff gashead

607.56 --> 613.26
right but yeah lots of good streams

610.26 --> 618.0
yesterday very interesting I just

613.26 --> 620.64
watched jiren's stream from Karen live

618.0 --> 623.64
just his show

620.64 --> 626.459
really good things really good talking

623.64 --> 627.8389999999999
points interesting very cleared up

626.459 --> 629.9399999999999
thoughts

627.839 --> 632.4200000000001
like I really appreciated listening to

629.94 --> 632.4200000000001
that show

632.76 --> 637.86
so Jaron is

635.64 --> 641.76
Aaron is going places

637.86 --> 644.66
he's focused it's good stuff anyway that

641.76 --> 648.24
and

644.66 --> 650.04
happy the gym Bob a bit of Mitchell from

648.24 --> 652.86
Australia of course with Brian's logic

650.04 --> 655.26
which is pretty intense show

652.86 --> 659.339
good stuff

655.26 --> 662.459
and yeah the the premiere from

659.339 --> 664.98
from Wednesday when I kind of blew up

662.459 --> 669.38
I listened back to it

664.98 --> 669.38
it was not as bad as I thought it was

671.82 --> 676.6400000000001
and I think that I've got a lot of

673.62 --> 676.64
sympathy for it even

677.519 --> 681.32
including from Nathan Oakley

682.92 --> 688.4399999999999
which already happened like even in the

685.44 --> 690.36
after show but it was just out of

688.44 --> 694.019
control Nathan even described it pretty

690.36 --> 697.279
accurately it was like he was attracted

694.019 --> 700.8
dim the fire down which yeah it was

697.279 --> 702.8389999999999
inflammable it's just the state right

700.8 --> 704.64
it's like really nervous and that's not

702.839 --> 706.44
gonna die down in everybody's poke at

704.64 --> 709.9399999999999
you but they ever a lot of people did

706.44 --> 713.0400000000001
insist on just keeping poking me

709.94 --> 715.5790000000001
primarily 10th Man and you just wouldn't

713.04 --> 715.579
let it go

716.16 --> 721.8
that Tony did a Tony move but I expected

719.82 --> 724.7
him to do that move right

721.8 --> 724.6999999999999
because it's Tony

726.24 --> 728.72
anyway

729.0 --> 735.74
listen back to that and yeah

732.36 --> 735.74
it was mostly just me

735.959 --> 742.92
but like the worst thing that I thought

738.24 --> 744.9590000000001
I had even said didn't weren't recorded

742.92 --> 748.3389999999999
I guess that everybody was just talking

744.959 --> 748.3389999999999
talking over one another

751.26 --> 756.24
good blowout

753.42 --> 758.579
a good blowout

756.24 --> 760.38
benefit in the long run

758.579 --> 763.8599999999999
well

760.38 --> 766.4399999999999
in a way yeah because after since that

763.86 --> 768.3000000000001
happened after that everybody's been

766.44 --> 769.8000000000001
really focused

768.3 --> 773.2199999999999
so

769.8 --> 776.8389999999999
not saying that oh I caused that

773.22 --> 776.839
but I might have like

779.339 --> 783.72
set a little fire and it and everybody

782.459 --> 788.4799999999999
like

783.72 --> 788.48
burned off some in a way I guess

798.3 --> 800.899
one degree

801.959 --> 807.8599999999999
drop oh there's no Drop Zone monkey none

804.66 --> 807.86
there is no drop

809.82 --> 817.339
The Horizon is not geometric

813.54 --> 817.3389999999999
trying to take the credit

817.98 --> 823.5600000000001
R try me time no

821.339 --> 825.839
I thought you were implying that towards

823.56 --> 827.9399999999999
me but no I wasn't trying to take the

825.839 --> 830.8800000000001
credit although yeah

827.94 --> 833.22
consider what if I wasn't there like

830.88 --> 836.54
what if I wasn't there ever what would

833.22 --> 836.5400000000001
the Flat Earth debate be like

841.86 --> 845.24
you know so maybe

846.3 --> 852.0
just do it take a win

848.76 --> 854.76
no but I am taking a win because as long

852.0 --> 856.92
as everything is all right afterward and

854.76 --> 858.6
it's not like now everybody is like that

856.92 --> 862.16
constantly

858.6 --> 862.16
then I take that as a win

868.38 --> 873.56
by the way it's not the first time

870.0 --> 873.56
anything like that this has happened

874.26 --> 883.519
I mean I've gotten into a lot of rowdy

878.0 --> 883.519
moments with flatter debates panelists

895.32 --> 901.8000000000001
all that you are red winged what are you

898.5 --> 905.16
talking about Aries 106

901.8 --> 909.079
oh that are you are referring to uh

905.16 --> 909.079
yeah it was Wednesday's show

909.6 --> 917.36
Nathan premiered it last night

913.86 --> 917.36
could link you up to it

919.38 --> 924.12
uncode after show in fighting with

921.899 --> 927.32
Einstein

924.12 --> 927.32
it's kind of a weird element

928.44 --> 933.0790000000001
yeah I'll link you up who's this one

947.04 --> 953.399
yeah but Gadget inspect Brenner is like

949.74 --> 956.699
a real political agent

953.399 --> 961.579
like she's a she's a Marxist

956.699 --> 961.579
methodologist like pretty blatantly

963.42 --> 968.699
so she's she says that about every

966.18 --> 971.6389999999999
flatter she's just like they're lying

968.699 --> 973.8
they're lying for no damn reason

971.639 --> 976.74
she said it about me she said that about

973.8 --> 979.199
every flat earther

976.74 --> 983.48
it's like a political action that she

979.199 --> 983.4799999999999
does it's really Petty

984.42 --> 988.62
anyway I was trying to record probably

986.82 --> 990.1800000000001
music but I missed it yeah I'll see you

988.62 --> 991.8
well the premiere song from yesterday

990.18 --> 993.899
was different

991.8 --> 996.8389999999999
it doesn't always play

993.899 --> 998.699
I think there's like four or five

996.839 --> 1000.5
different songs maybe more maybe it's

998.699 --> 1001.579
like 10 and I just haven't picked up on

1000.5 --> 1004.1
them

1001.579 --> 1006.7399999999999
so you kind of got to be lucky to catch

1004.1 --> 1009.019
that awesome wave song

1006.74 --> 1011.66
there's some other songs that are what

1009.019 --> 1013.399
they're okay not bad and then there's

1011.66 --> 1015.019
some kind of boring minimalist songs

1013.399 --> 1017.62
that I don't like but others probably

1015.019 --> 1017.62
like that

1018.56 --> 1023.7199999999999
but that one song is like

1022.339 --> 1026.6000000000001
yeah I did

1023.72 --> 1029.079
it doesn't like play every day

1026.6 --> 1029.079
right

1031.459 --> 1038.48
can Brenda form a sentence without Adam

1034.52 --> 1041.48
dude that's like asking rumpus

1038.48 --> 1043.28
to start out the debate without making a

1041.48 --> 1046.959
declaration that he's always right and

1043.28 --> 1046.959
that flat earthers are always wrong

1047.12 --> 1053.1999999999998
it's like that's

1048.7 --> 1053.2
unreasonable based on their character

1056.059 --> 1064.299
and yeah that that statements based on

1059.179 --> 1064.299
like five years of experience with that

1065.299 --> 1070.1
because rompers and Brenda have been out

1067.4 --> 1072.3200000000002
there being anti-flat earthers for a

1070.1 --> 1074.12
long long time

1072.32 --> 1075.86
they're like the veterans from the

1074.12 --> 1077.8999999999999
anti-flatter side and there's a couple

1075.86 --> 1079.28
of them

1077.9 --> 1083.72
you could say that

1079.28 --> 1086.36
rumpus and Brenda and Georgina are like

1083.72 --> 1088.58
the first generation of anti-flatter

1086.36 --> 1090.32
authors and people like Simon Dan and

1088.58 --> 1091.9399999999998
fight the Flat Earth they're the second

1090.32 --> 1094.8999999999999
Generations they're they're the ones

1091.94 --> 1094.9
that came after that

1097.52 --> 1102.34
a GM Panda definitely first generation

1100.039 --> 1102.34
yeah

1105.02 --> 1111.679
first generation are the ones

1107.6 --> 1113.8999999999999
that were already around doing things

1111.679 --> 1115.88
in the time where the first flattered

1113.9 --> 1118.16
infighting really started and that's

1115.88 --> 1119.48
also when they made their move moved in

1118.16 --> 1122.179
on everybody

1119.48 --> 1124.4
up closer

1122.179 --> 1126.799
and that's now

1124.4 --> 1130.66
I think like five

1126.799 --> 1130.66
between four or five years ago

1137.48 --> 1141.94
that fight the Flat Earth is a goofball

1139.52 --> 1141.94
yeah

1143.179 --> 1148.5800000000002
I mean the guy completely overplays

1145.76 --> 1150.62
himself he really thinks he's

1148.58 --> 1154.72
all special

1150.62 --> 1154.7199999999998
like I think he actually believes it

1156.2 --> 1160.82
but when you try to pin him down and he

1158.24 --> 1162.799
just weasels his way and gets all at

1160.82 --> 1165.76
homie and gamma

1162.799 --> 1165.76
but yeah

1176.799 --> 1181.4189999999999
had some moments of being a smart ass

1181.52 --> 1185.5
it's all very typical uh

1192.14 --> 1196.94
sent to distract from the beating Mr

1194.179 --> 1201.22
sensible was getting yeah

1196.94 --> 1201.22
Mr sensible also second generation

1210.26 --> 1214.82
he actually did you know that Mr

1212.419 --> 1218.2990000000002
sensible actually in that jet there

1214.82 --> 1221.539
tried to apologize to me

1218.299 --> 1223.52
for playing songs over

1221.539 --> 1226.039
yeah our

1223.52 --> 1228.559
our live show

1226.039 --> 1231.14
and then asked me like oh you can come

1228.559 --> 1232.78
on again all right

1231.14 --> 1236.7800000000002
this is

1232.78 --> 1236.78
sure not

1245.48 --> 1251.2
Brenda on Brandon's was a real problem

1248.419 --> 1251.2
what do you mean

1275.919 --> 1281.44
oh look look at Rick Montgomery oh

1282.38 --> 1288.5590000000002
oh somebody that converted back to the

1285.559 --> 1293.98
ball because of what went in the back

1288.559 --> 1293.98
in the background this Preposterous dude

1308.179 --> 1313.1000000000001
disrupting the show yeah she was very

1310.82 --> 1315.7
disruptive I've heard some of that what

1313.1 --> 1315.6999999999998
a waste

1317.659 --> 1320.919
she's a real troll

1327.919 --> 1333.7990000000002
asks a serious question

1331.76 --> 1337.46
all right

1333.799 --> 1340.22
well yeah yeah ranty did convert back to

1337.46 --> 1344.8600000000001
the globe and has been

1340.22 --> 1344.8600000000001
just a giant mess ever since

1345.08 --> 1349.72
and it just a total gamma

1357.679 --> 1363.3400000000001
what make sure you charge an appearance

1360.62 --> 1363.34
fee now what

1366.38 --> 1369.2800000000002
the [ __ ]

1375.919 --> 1381.0800000000002
I wonder who pays him

1377.96 --> 1383.48
yeah that's what we're wondering too

1381.08 --> 1386.539
that was all you don't forget Rick

1383.48 --> 1389.059
Montgomery before he converted back

1386.539 --> 1393.82
there was all kinds of weird financial

1389.059 --> 1393.82
[ __ ] going on with super chats

1395.48 --> 1400.84
I'm not gonna get into the details of it

1397.82 --> 1400.84
but like yeah

1401.539 --> 1406.7
he was really

1404.659 --> 1410.3600000000001
kind of ready to

1406.7 --> 1413.559
to basically do whatever

1410.36 --> 1413.559
to get money even

1416.0 --> 1420.86
he did he did all kinds of like really

1418.76 --> 1423.02
stupid stunts

1420.86 --> 1428.1399999999999
like the remember the whole infecto

1423.02 --> 1428.1399999999999
thing that was just completely idiotic

1431.12 --> 1435.6999999999998
and that was before he converted

1441.799 --> 1446.4189999999999
right and he was even dude he's even

1444.559 --> 1448.6399999999999
mentioned in

1446.419 --> 1451.4
well private conversations that are now

1448.64 --> 1453.74
quite some time ago and I've warned

1451.4 --> 1456.679
people about it that he was like gonna

1453.74 --> 1459.02
play the ballers

1456.679 --> 1461.179
it was gonna he announced that what he

1459.02 --> 1464.26
was gonna do because he thinks that he's

1461.179 --> 1464.26
like this player

1471.5 --> 1477.98
or at least he thought that at the time

1475.58 --> 1481.22
so a lot of us have suspected that he's

1477.98 --> 1484.279
just engaged in some kind of a deal

1481.22 --> 1488.299
right because allegedly some of these

1484.279 --> 1491.36
anti-flat earthers are really wealthy

1488.299 --> 1495.6399999999999
one individual in particular

1491.36 --> 1495.6399999999999
and it's very suspicious all of that

1502.46 --> 1506.5
maybe he's a double agent

1507.74 --> 1513.74
well maybe he thinks he's one

1511.4 --> 1516.6200000000001
but I don't know how he's spying though

1513.74 --> 1519.02
I don't I don't even understand what

1516.62 --> 1520.4599999999998
function that would serve at this point

1519.02 --> 1522.1399999999999
really

1520.46 --> 1525.14
because

1522.14 --> 1527.6000000000001
the Ballers and the anti-flators are

1525.14 --> 1530.24
really predictable

1527.6 --> 1533.539
like so predictable

1530.24 --> 1535.7
it it goes beyond Quantum level like you

1533.539 --> 1538.34
don't really even have to see what

1535.7 --> 1542.1200000000001
they're actually doing even in secret

1538.34 --> 1546.34
to be able to very accurately predict

1542.12 --> 1546.34
what type of things they are gonna do

1547.52 --> 1552.9189999999999
because yeah they can keep secrets about

1550.46 --> 1555.679
their plans and all that but because of

1552.919 --> 1557.72
their real religious Obsession because

1555.679 --> 1560.779
of their mission

1557.72 --> 1562.82
they mechanically within the actual

1560.779 --> 1565.7
philosophical struggle have very little

1562.82 --> 1569.4189999999999
maneuvering room

1565.7 --> 1572.9
and once you truly realize that

1569.419 --> 1575.179
then you'll figure out

1572.9 --> 1576.679
very easily kind of what sort of thing

1575.179 --> 1579.3200000000002
they're gonna do like they don't

1576.679 --> 1582.14
surprise me you see

1579.32 --> 1587.299
they don't actually surprise me like I'm

1582.14 --> 1590.679
like whoa didn't expect that no

1587.299 --> 1590.679
that's very rare

1590.84 --> 1596.1399999999999
when that happens it's usually that they

1593.36 --> 1596.1399999999999
suddenly like

1597.5 --> 1602.919
become really apologetic and seem

1600.38 --> 1602.919
genuine

1604.22 --> 1608.659
that's something that sometimes like

1606.14 --> 1610.94
catches me a little off guard

1608.659 --> 1613.8200000000002
they didn't used to do that at all ever

1610.94 --> 1616.64
now they seem to have learned that like

1613.82 --> 1618.3799999999999
common decency skill in a way some of

1616.64 --> 1620.24
them do apply it

1618.38 --> 1621.98
but they never really hold true to it

1620.24 --> 1624.02
because if you then think that they're

1621.98 --> 1625.4
all trustworthy again they're gonna pull

1624.02 --> 1628.72
you back in

1625.4 --> 1628.72
and you're going to end up

1628.76 --> 1635.059
right where you were before that apology

1631.76 --> 1639.1589999999999
with them so

1635.059 --> 1639.1589999999999
oh Jake the [ __ ] God

1640.22 --> 1644.779
dude he's an [ __ ] it's literally in

1643.88 --> 1647.44
his name

1644.779 --> 1647.44
dude

1654.26 --> 1658.899
it's a randomly secretly knows it's flat

1673.82 --> 1679.48
Jake the [ __ ] is a legit [ __ ] yeah

1691.88 --> 1694.0590000000002
foreign

1701.02 --> 1707.679
maybe you like his style or something

1703.34 --> 1707.6789999999999
but he's been nothing but trouble

1714.38 --> 1719.14
a legit truther okay whatever that means

1721.22 --> 1726.2
I mean

1723.74 --> 1727.76
what is legit truth or somebody that

1726.2 --> 1730.3990000000001
just

1727.76 --> 1734.08
is completely unrestrained in their

1730.399 --> 1734.08
paranoia towards others

1734.36 --> 1740.9189999999999
that sees it like a secret agenda under

1738.26 --> 1740.919
every Rock

1742.1 --> 1745.299
is that a truther

1758.12 --> 1763.2399999999998
as legit as me that's an insult dude no

1765.86 --> 1770.32
now don't compare that guy to me thanks

1780.159 --> 1787.659
sometimes he's out of order or regularly

1784.76 --> 1787.6589999999999
how about that

1788.419 --> 1793.3990000000001
and I don't like his style he's like

1790.94 --> 1794.659
super Sleazy and [ __ ]

1793.399 --> 1797.32
just

1794.659 --> 1797.3200000000002
oh

1800.419 --> 1806.919
it has a sense of humor well I guess

1803.96 --> 1806.919
tastes differ

1816.14 --> 1822.3200000000002
I don't know man I kind of see Jake

1819.5 --> 1824.899
and I don't know him that well but just

1822.32 --> 1828.76
the way it feels I don't know

1824.899 --> 1832.779
and it's rough to compare it

1828.76 --> 1832.779
reminds me about IPS

1833.24 --> 1838.52
except IPS was kind of really creepy I

1836.779 --> 1841.7
don't think he Jake is like but he's

1838.52 --> 1843.9189999999999
like halfway like that and just always

1841.7 --> 1846.559
playing

1843.919 --> 1849.0200000000002
I don't know

1846.559 --> 1851.0
maybe he's he's last time even saw

1849.02 --> 1852.1399999999999
anything from him is like a long time

1851.0 --> 1854.6
ago

1852.14 --> 1856.64
although I did like take a look a

1854.6 --> 1861.6789999999999
glimpse

1856.64 --> 1864.2
at like the the RV related [ __ ] and he

1861.679 --> 1869.44
was going after

1864.2 --> 1869.44
Flat Earth Folker also it just ugh

1894.82 --> 1902.3799999999999
yeah Ever After show what

1898.519 --> 1902.38
are you talking about Anthony Kelly

1923.0 --> 1929.919
Darwin in a small fake mirror is pretty

1926.419 --> 1929.919
odd too what does that mean

1939.919 --> 1945.3200000000002
okay Anthony yeah yeah well the discard

1942.86 --> 1946.82
gets cut off from the the Google Plus

1945.32 --> 1949.7
panel so

1946.82 --> 1952.519
it's like after the after show starts

1949.7 --> 1954.8600000000001
Nathan drops and then yeah you got two

1952.519 --> 1957.26
separate rooms doing their own thing

1954.86 --> 1958.76
we had like long conversations afterward

1957.26 --> 1961.519
too

1958.76 --> 1963.019
but yeah we don't get any Ballers or

1961.519 --> 1967.419
anything in

1963.019 --> 1967.419
after that point it's just us guys

1985.82 --> 1993.74
the juice is the mark

1989.24 --> 1996.32
no I think that the choice to believe

1993.74 --> 2000.7
and go with and become part of things

1996.32 --> 2003.9399999999998
that you know are false and that you

2000.7 --> 2006.1000000000001
like blank that out for yourself I think

2003.94 --> 2008.14
that is the mark of the beast I think

2006.1 --> 2012.279
that the mark of the beast

2008.14 --> 2014.8200000000002
could be exoterically placed on many

2012.279 --> 2017.5
things and operations and like oh

2014.82 --> 2020.86
playing with the chip in your hand or

2017.5 --> 2024.159
your mobile phone or

2020.86 --> 2027.519
having a contract that has little

2024.159 --> 2029.74
little closures in there that you didn't

2027.519 --> 2031.6
understand at the time and now you got a

2029.74 --> 2034.299
problem like all those things could be

2031.6 --> 2036.2199999999998
in ways considered a mark of the beast

2034.299 --> 2039.76
but I think that the true mark of the

2036.22 --> 2044.98
beast is purely spiritual purely

2039.76 --> 2047.32
it's the decision to go with it anyway

2044.98 --> 2050.919
even though you know

2047.32 --> 2054.159
and then you lose that Insight in the

2050.919 --> 2056.379
process you become part of the Beast I

2054.159 --> 2059.619
think that's the real mark of the beast

2056.379 --> 2062.639
and it happens all the time in big ways

2059.619 --> 2062.639
and in small ways

2071.32 --> 2076.8990000000003
but yeah that's me you know it is very

2074.8 --> 2080.579
debatable

2076.899 --> 2080.5789999999997
and people are going to keep doing that

2081.46 --> 2086.56
right like for just an example what if

2084.579 --> 2088.599
the mark of the beasts

2086.56 --> 2091.24
is

2088.599 --> 2095.76
the mobile in your hand

2091.24 --> 2095.7599999999998
and the VR goggles on your forehead

2098.26 --> 2100.619
right

2102.82 --> 2109.599
see how easy that is

2106.18 --> 2112.1189999999997
and how how much it fits and it's just

2109.599 --> 2114.7200000000003
one thing that's why I'm saying

2112.119 --> 2117.46
that's an exoteric interpretation

2114.72 --> 2119.5
placing it in actual devices in

2117.46 --> 2122.26
time-based situations

2119.5 --> 2125.68
well I think that the actual mark of the

2122.26 --> 2127.8
beast is purely esoteric it's about the

2125.68 --> 2130.72
spiritual choice of the confrontation

2127.8 --> 2133.8390000000004
like you know this is wrong

2130.72 --> 2136.7799999999997
but you're gonna defend it because you

2133.839 --> 2138.94
want Power convenience something that

2136.78 --> 2142.26
you would get out of knowingly defending

2138.94 --> 2142.26
something that you know is wrong

2144.82 --> 2149.7400000000002
and involvement might be that you think

2147.88 --> 2152.26
that you can get away with it you're

2149.74 --> 2154.5
hiding it or even end up hiding it from

2152.26 --> 2154.5
yourself

2155.619 --> 2159.2200000000003
it's a choice to serve the system

2157.54 --> 2163.02
instead of to save it yeah well that's

2159.22 --> 2163.02
one way of saying it Neil yes

2169.0 --> 2173.56
right it's stepping away from the

2171.22 --> 2176.52
clarity and purity of the light of

2173.56 --> 2176.52
insight and Truth

2177.099 --> 2182.02
and to compartmentalize it and then

2180.099 --> 2187.48
roll out

2182.02 --> 2191.099
Beast system adapted information instead

2187.48 --> 2191.099
effectively gatekeeping

2193.24 --> 2198.16
and dude there's so many people just

2196.24 --> 2200.74
caught up in that and it's most of them

2198.16 --> 2203.8199999999997
I think don't even fully realize like

2200.74 --> 2203.8199999999997
what it is they're doing

2205.839 --> 2210.7599999999998
but it's very likely that at some point

2207.88 --> 2212.5
they will wake up to it like it take

2210.76 --> 2214.1800000000003
takes a lot of time and sometimes it's

2212.5 --> 2215.98
like they need that's just something

2214.18 --> 2217.7799999999997
they need to do they need to become part

2215.98 --> 2221.619
of a project

2217.78 --> 2224.7000000000003
even just for their own development

2221.619 --> 2224.7000000000003
really complicated

2225.4 --> 2227.88
uh

2231.76 --> 2234.88
yeah by the way good to see you here

2233.2 --> 2237.16
Neil

2234.88 --> 2240.1600000000003
I I really appreciate like to well

2237.16 --> 2241.96
pretty sudden attitude shift because you

2240.16 --> 2244.2
were kind of riled up as well on

2241.96 --> 2244.2
Wednesday

2245.8 --> 2252.46
and I don't blame you do like yeah

2248.98 --> 2256.78
you're kind of inflammable and the the

2252.46 --> 2260.56
the atmosphere the energy was just Rife

2256.78 --> 2263.32
it was just a Cake Powder Keg and yeah

2260.56 --> 2265.48
when those go off you go off too so I

2263.32 --> 2268.32
don't blame you but I really appreciate

2265.48 --> 2272.56
like that you also

2268.32 --> 2272.56
recognized it afterward

2275.44 --> 2279.06
none shall pass

2283.06 --> 2290.68
we all sounded like second graders yeah

2286.96 --> 2293.68
yeah we did I had serious flashbacks to

2290.68 --> 2296.56
that [ __ ] when it was happening

2293.68 --> 2301.06
like serious it's like I was surrounded

2296.56 --> 2304.66
by the typical environment that that

2301.06 --> 2307.0789999999997
place that school was just like it was

2304.66 --> 2309.46
literally just virtually shifting

2307.079 --> 2311.82
manifesting around me as all that was

2309.46 --> 2311.82
happening

2312.4 --> 2317.619
so I guess some kind of like

2314.68 --> 2322.2
post-traumatic

2317.619 --> 2322.2000000000003
thing came out on my side

2326.74 --> 2331.8999999999996
and it was like really really triggered

2329.14 --> 2334.56
couldn't stop it

2331.9 --> 2334.56
uh

2351.28 --> 2355.44
here it is George Sanford

2360.7 --> 2365.859
of course you always have the choice to

2362.92 --> 2369.28
only think about you and your freedom

2365.859 --> 2372.46
your personal mental freedom

2369.28 --> 2374.26
freedom of principles and to not carry

2372.46 --> 2376.96
any weight from what's Happening outside

2374.26 --> 2379.9
or even relinquish this responsibility

2376.96 --> 2383.099
from doing that and just worry about you

2379.9 --> 2383.099
yeah you can do that too

2385.18 --> 2387.96
it's your choice

2402.579 --> 2407.7000000000003
huh all right Neil I really appreciate

2405.4 --> 2407.7000000000003
that

2447.94 --> 2453.28
where do we go once the majority knows

2450.819 --> 2455.94
the Earth is flat

2453.28 --> 2455.94
dude

2458.8 --> 2464.319
when there's like psychological warfare

2461.44 --> 2466.0
tensions out there in the on the level

2464.319 --> 2467.98
they are

2466.0 --> 2470.28
used to say you could keep them there

2467.98 --> 2470.28
right

2472.3 --> 2475.96
I think it's a kind of a universal

2474.099 --> 2479.1400000000003
mission for anybody that doesn't want

2475.96 --> 2481.18
the entire world to be to blow up into

2479.14 --> 2484.44
madness

2481.18 --> 2487.4199999999996
it's all about just stabilizing things

2484.44 --> 2489.819
counter psychological warfare give

2487.42 --> 2491.38
people the tools the insights and the

2489.819 --> 2494.38
confidence

2491.38 --> 2497.5
in their own Dynamic growth

2494.38 --> 2500.26
to face the ever worse growing

2497.5 --> 2502.66
psychological warfare operations

2500.26 --> 2504.4
and then how to deal or you have to

2502.66 --> 2506.74
learn how to deal with those that can't

2504.4 --> 2508.359
that can't deal with it that's so

2506.74 --> 2510.52
important

2508.359 --> 2512.859
because more and more people are just

2510.52 --> 2515.619
gonna at some point like I can't deal

2512.859 --> 2518.74
with this anymore I'm I'm gonna give up

2515.619 --> 2521.46
I'm just like Gonna Take a Shot or

2518.74 --> 2521.4599999999996
something or

2522.339 --> 2529.72
like be bullied by your Social Circle

2526.0 --> 2532.06
into certain convictions and chants

2529.72 --> 2534.0989999999997
that's gonna happen when things become

2532.06 --> 2536.619
just so bad

2534.099 --> 2539.38
that's that people just don't have the

2536.619 --> 2541.0
stamina anymore to deal with it

2539.38 --> 2543.2200000000003
they need help

2541.0 --> 2546.22
they need counsel advice they need

2543.22 --> 2549.819
tricks they need

2546.22 --> 2552.819
to re maintain their confidence and

2549.819 --> 2555.94
that's not just flat earthers that's

2552.819 --> 2557.74
everybody really but yeah how do you get

2555.94 --> 2561.06
to them how do you make that contact

2557.74 --> 2561.06
it's all difficult

2561.64 --> 2566.7999999999997
sometimes just the moments arrive and

2564.339 --> 2569.16
they just open up to you and then you

2566.8 --> 2569.1600000000003
can try

2570.94 --> 2575.92
right so technically

2573.099 --> 2579.2400000000002
for the flat earthers

2575.92 --> 2579.2400000000002
it is mostly about

2580.54 --> 2586.24
keeping the lore

2583.48 --> 2588.7
and making sure you know

2586.24 --> 2591.64
what it is how it changes and how it

2588.7 --> 2595.1189999999997
doesn't change so that you can't be

2591.64 --> 2596.7999999999997
dragged along in some Reformation of

2595.119 --> 2599.38
everything where people just forget it

2596.8 --> 2602.2200000000003
all and just get fall for a new story

2599.38 --> 2602.2200000000003
that's different

2603.339 --> 2608.68
right because the more strainful

2605.859 --> 2611.7999999999997
everything becomes psychologically the

2608.68 --> 2614.74
tougher it is to maintain a cohesive

2611.8 --> 2617.2000000000003
oversight with memories

2614.74 --> 2620.22
about what's happening

2617.2 --> 2620.22
it's a challenge

2623.079 --> 2628.54
and I think that flat earthers

2625.78 --> 2630.8190000000004
if they can step out of the polarized

2628.54 --> 2632.8
situation like oh we're against the

2630.819 --> 2634.7799999999997
globers if they can kind of step away

2632.8 --> 2636.94
from that philosophical struggle which

2634.78 --> 2639.78
is still

2636.94 --> 2639.78
pretty heavy

2640.96 --> 2646.599
then we could help people

2644.619 --> 2648.2200000000003
by just showing look this is what's

2646.599 --> 2650.339
going on this is how you can deal with

2648.22 --> 2650.339
it

2652.06 --> 2657.88
look this is what we've discovered in

2654.64 --> 2660.8799999999997
personal management in health things in

2657.88 --> 2664.839
in refining

2660.88 --> 2669.2200000000003
spiritual enlightenment by

2664.839 --> 2671.859
like delicing religious control systems

2669.22 --> 2673.4199999999996
by basically analyzing like what are the

2671.859 --> 2675.2799999999997
good things in this religion and what

2673.42 --> 2679.54
are the bad things how do we get rid of

2675.28 --> 2683.46
the bad behaviors in individuals and

2679.54 --> 2683.46
maybe even in procedures whatever

2684.24 --> 2689.3999999999996
Reformation based on purity

2692.02 --> 2697.06
and personal realization and

2694.839 --> 2699.339
responsibility

2697.06 --> 2703.619
anyway

2699.339 --> 2703.619
so yeah that's what I think we should do

2724.06 --> 2727.9
if you turn off TV and social media

2726.339 --> 2730.06
everything is good in your world okay

2727.9 --> 2732.46
well that sounds great George Sanford

2730.06 --> 2734.319
but you know that even if you do that

2732.46 --> 2735.579
you're still gonna bump into it through

2734.319 --> 2737.619
other people

2735.579 --> 2741.04
you know that

2737.619 --> 2743.319
unless you're like completely isolated

2741.04 --> 2745.48
from the entire world like in in the

2743.319 --> 2747.64
forest in the middle of nowhere and you

2745.48 --> 2751.2400000000002
never even go like to

2747.64 --> 2752.7999999999997
some store to get Goods or equipment

2751.24 --> 2756.72
because you're gonna bump into people

2752.8 --> 2756.7200000000003
and they are immersed in it

2757.06 --> 2760.2599999999998
you're gonna face it

2767.74 --> 2772.1189999999997
right I never

2769.72 --> 2773.5
watch mainstream news

2772.119 --> 2776.7400000000002
anymore

2773.5 --> 2778.3
like ever now like my mainstream news if

2776.74 --> 2780.04
you can really call it that is like Alex

2778.3 --> 2782.1400000000003
Jones

2780.04 --> 2783.819
and there I already have to sit through

2782.14 --> 2785.859
things where I know just like that's

2783.819 --> 2787.96
that narrative that's that narrative

2785.859 --> 2790.96
this is getting annoying

2787.96 --> 2793.0
this is lame not everything by the way

2790.96 --> 2794.56
like I still appreciate Alex Jones some

2793.0 --> 2796.42
of the things

2794.56 --> 2799.18
but yeah that I already have to deal

2796.42 --> 2802.78
with that okay you imagine like watching

2799.18 --> 2803.56
CNN God I literally throw up within a

2802.78 --> 2807.2200000000003
minute

2803.56 --> 2809.339
but other people do watch it they don't

2807.22 --> 2812.859
get it they they got rolled in there

2809.339 --> 2815.44
they didn't see it

2812.859 --> 2818.2
and you're gonna be facing

2815.44 --> 2820.599
things because of the programming out

2818.2 --> 2824.3999999999996
there even though you don't watch it

2820.599 --> 2824.4
you're gonna be reminded about it

2830.5 --> 2835.48
everything out of that no it's not

2833.319 --> 2838.96
no idiot

2835.48 --> 2842.02
no no he actually in 2010 I was there

2838.96 --> 2843.94
read the documents that described

2842.02 --> 2845.74
everything that's happening right now

2843.94 --> 2848.64
and Beyond

2845.74 --> 2848.64
yeah do you understand

2850.54 --> 2854.92
everything out of his mouth is not

2852.46 --> 2857.8
[ __ ]

2854.92 --> 2860.26
Alex Jones was freaking right about a

2857.8 --> 2862.3590000000004
bunch of things and now he made like

2860.26 --> 2863.1400000000003
he's kind of like a he always wants to

2862.359 --> 2865.7799999999997
like

2863.14 --> 2868.18
pull the maximum fear point out of

2865.78 --> 2869.6800000000003
things and he does like oh it's a Fells

2868.18 --> 2870.8799999999997
flagged I'm all this is gonna happen and

2869.68 --> 2872.14
then like most of the time doesn't

2870.88 --> 2875.1400000000003
happen

2872.14 --> 2878.02
but when he brings out documents and his

2875.14 --> 2880.72
crew and him studied that that's real

2878.02 --> 2882.88
that's not [ __ ] just because you

2880.72 --> 2884.7999999999997
didn't catch it at the time or didn't

2882.88 --> 2888.099
believe it because everybody was poo

2884.8 --> 2891.42
pooing it like everybody in the world

2888.099 --> 2891.42
that's your problem

2899.619 --> 2905.52
very far right Alex Jones

2902.68 --> 2905.52
what's up

2909.52 --> 2914.8
sleaze well yeah you can be a very he

2911.92 --> 2916.059
can't be a sleaze but I agree right this

2914.8 --> 2918.579
is not about

2916.059 --> 2922.6800000000003
character this is about

2918.579 --> 2922.6800000000003
the information that passes through

2924.099 --> 2929.7400000000002
for multiple reasons right there's some

2927.52 --> 2932.4
kind of blatant agents on there

2929.74 --> 2932.3999999999996
sometimes

2933.579 --> 2937.8390000000004
like projects so

2935.8 --> 2939.819
where I get to see a lot of different

2937.839 --> 2943.24
things

2939.819 --> 2946.7799999999997
watching very carefully and having like

2943.24 --> 2949.7799999999997
studied him for over a decade

2946.78 --> 2952.8390000000004
over a decade

2949.78 --> 2956.4
and I just know like okay this is

2952.839 --> 2956.4
something that's out there

2957.4 --> 2963.46
right this like the

2960.76 --> 2965.6800000000003
the population agenda and the medical

2963.46 --> 2968.16
tyranny that's now unrolling and even

2965.68 --> 2972.3999999999996
before that other things

2968.16 --> 2974.3799999999997
weird drills that we then suspect oh

2972.4 --> 2977.4
that might go live and then sometimes it

2974.38 --> 2977.4
does sometimes it doesn't

2977.559 --> 2983.8590000000004
those are that's good info because it's

2980.38 --> 2985.78
based on Raw data published raw data

2983.859 --> 2987.64
from the people that actually do that

2985.78 --> 2989.7400000000002
[ __ ] and then other times there's like

2987.64 --> 2992.2
oh there's a speaking Point coming in

2989.74 --> 2994.4199999999996
it's like narrative reinforcement in

2992.2 --> 2996.46
certain ways other people are special

2994.42 --> 2999.2200000000003
guests and oh they're so promote and

2996.46 --> 3004.859
then it's like I get a look

2999.22 --> 3008.2799999999997
at what the agency wants you see

3004.859 --> 3012.48
I can Divine the agency's motivations

3008.28 --> 3015.599
like their agencies through

3012.48 --> 3018.18
their agents it's not their age they

3015.599 --> 3021.78
just use the platform to do their thing

3018.18 --> 3024.5589999999997
to spread their narrative so for me it's

3021.78 --> 3024.559
a great

3025.079 --> 3029.3
place to study

3032.059 --> 3037.559
oh yeah squirt for me that's all fine

3035.04 --> 3041.7599999999998
you don't like him oh yeah yeah I know

3037.559 --> 3045.98
there's there's issues many issues and

3041.76 --> 3045.98
ah I don't want to get into that

3046.2 --> 3048.74
see

3048.9 --> 3052.579
I'm just there for the goods

3053.339 --> 3059.339
and if you don't know what package is to

3056.579 --> 3062.28
pick and what what packages to leave

3059.339 --> 3065.0
yeah you're gonna end up with Messi

3062.28 --> 3065.0
nonsense

3066.3 --> 3071.7000000000003
if you do know how to pick your packages

3069.48 --> 3077.18
that he presents then

3071.7 --> 3077.18
you'll find them to be very informative

3080.64 --> 3083.5989999999997
puppet of what

3084.599 --> 3087.6800000000003
how does that work

3088.079 --> 3093.119
how is the right if you're saying it's a

3090.839 --> 3095.22
puppet for somebody that means

3093.119 --> 3098.099
well that he's a puppet for somebody so

3095.22 --> 3100.14
who is he a puppet for exactly who is

3098.099 --> 3102.839
puppeteering the him

3100.14 --> 3104.54
what's your proof for that exactly and I

3102.839 --> 3108.48
know oh

3104.54 --> 3111.359
he had business with that Mega

3108.48 --> 3113.76
Corporation that's slightly Shady or

3111.359 --> 3117.2599999999998
that corporate yeah

3113.76 --> 3117.26
how is that puppeteering

3121.619 --> 3126.599
you don't really seem to understand what

3123.72 --> 3129.72
puppeteering is like mainstream news

3126.599 --> 3132.3
readers they are provable puppets

3129.72 --> 3136.14
they have think tanks

3132.3 --> 3138.54
that really are the real intellectual

3136.14 --> 3140.04
leaders of like that media of those

3138.54 --> 3142.74
media operations

3140.04 --> 3145.5
they're the ones telling them exactly

3142.74 --> 3147.68
what to say and then they act it

3145.5 --> 3150.48
that's puppeteering that's like

3147.68 --> 3154.5589999999997
reprovable traceable

3150.48 --> 3157.22
how is Alex a puppet to who exactly how

3154.559 --> 3157.2200000000003
does that work

3158.16 --> 3163.3999999999996
didn't really think it through did you

3160.68 --> 3163.3999999999996
SKS

3171.599 --> 3177.079
ah all right service day

3173.88 --> 3177.079
thanks for being in chat

3191.64 --> 3195.2599999999998
yes guys well that

3195.66 --> 3200.64
is trying to spend a lot of time on

3198.059 --> 3202.98
indeed going against the mainstream

3200.64 --> 3205.44
narrative even though mainstream media

3202.98 --> 3209.359
narrative sometimes is so dumb

3205.44 --> 3209.359
that it's almost a waste of time

3213.48 --> 3218.76
right and when he does that

3216.42 --> 3221.88
sometimes it's funny because it's like

3218.76 --> 3224.6400000000003
crazy people videos

3221.88 --> 3226.319
sometimes and sometimes it just gets

3224.64 --> 3228.7999999999997
annoying

3226.319 --> 3232.2599999999998
personally like I don't like the whole

3228.8 --> 3235.8590000000004
January 6th thing I I guess it

3232.26 --> 3237.6600000000003
seems important it might still turn out

3235.859 --> 3241.2799999999997
to be pretty important

3237.66 --> 3241.2799999999997
I mean they did like

3241.859 --> 3247.02
the Democrats did like blatantly steal

3244.44 --> 3250.44
the elections from Trump like that's a

3247.02 --> 3252.18
fact I don't care to debate it I really

3250.44 --> 3254.099
don't

3252.18 --> 3257.52
does it's not not important to me to

3254.099 --> 3260.099
even have an opinion on it for anything

3257.52 --> 3261.78
so I get it but it's just like at some

3260.099 --> 3266.54
point like dude I don't want to listen

3261.78 --> 3266.5400000000004
hours to that [ __ ] like Ugh

3273.599 --> 3276.559
so there's just

3276.599 --> 3282.48
different things that are traded

3279.72 --> 3284.8799999999997
on the Alex Jones platforms and some of

3282.48 --> 3286.559
them are really interesting some of them

3284.88 --> 3292.099
are kind of shady

3286.559 --> 3292.099
and some are like really Niche political

3295.619 --> 3299.579
and that's it

3297.839 --> 3301.859
that's what it is

3299.579 --> 3304.3390000000004
for me

3301.859 --> 3304.339
anyway

3304.68 --> 3310.339
if we can handle him then don't watch

3308.04 --> 3310.339
him

3312.299 --> 3315.2599999999998
foreign

3329.18 --> 3336.02
credit cards as well huh

3333.42 --> 3336.02
all right

3351.119 --> 3356.54
oh man

3352.7 --> 3356.54
oh time has flown

3357.42 --> 3361.099
what did we even talk about

3370.44 --> 3375.839
wow that's ridiculous oh yeah thank you

3373.44 --> 3377.64
by the way for timing Rick Montgomery

3375.839 --> 3379.5589999999997
out there I'll see that was I didn't

3377.64 --> 3382.94
even see that

3379.559 --> 3382.94
that's insane

3383.64 --> 3390.7799999999997
so this guy is has swaddled like

3387.96 --> 3392.64
poisonous psychologically poisonous

3390.78 --> 3395.5400000000004
mainstream pills

3392.64 --> 3395.54
completely

3395.819 --> 3400.68
calling him like

3397.799 --> 3403.44
far right wing I didn't even realize

3400.68 --> 3406.98
that after that he said like oh you oh

3403.44 --> 3410.339
that that means he's the Nazi

3406.98 --> 3415.14
that's [ __ ]

3410.339 --> 3417.599
let's just straight out [ __ ]

3415.14 --> 3419.339
especially if you figure out like what's

3417.599 --> 3422.099
actually happening out there in the

3419.339 --> 3424.16
world what people in Authority positions

3422.099 --> 3426.8590000000004
are actually doing

3424.16 --> 3429.54
which is

3426.859 --> 3432.24
like Nazis

3429.54 --> 3438.42
but you're still gonna call Alex Jones a

3432.24 --> 3438.4199999999996
Nazi because he is right wing that's

3438.839 --> 3441.98
really dumb

3443.4 --> 3447.9
that kind of makes you unworthy to be in

3445.799 --> 3450.38
this chat really if that's your honest

3447.9 --> 3450.38
opinion

3452.88 --> 3456.98
it hasn't really gotten back

3460.14 --> 3463.52
maybe that's for the best

3491.04 --> 3495.0
put him on double top yeah but that

3492.839 --> 3497.88
doesn't work I'll see you can only add

3495.0 --> 3500.64
do one timeout doesn't

3497.88 --> 3503.9
the five minutes don't end add up when

3500.64 --> 3503.9
you time out him twice

3510.66 --> 3513.5589999999997
low Cleary

3564.059 --> 3571.8190000000004
wow just it's one of those days where

3567.599 --> 3571.819
there's just the sights are amazing

3572.88 --> 3575.059
foreign

3575.579 --> 3579.8390000000004
look at that

3576.88 --> 3583.4
[Music]

3579.839 --> 3583.4
that's like a painting

3588.66 --> 3594.5
don't you think

3590.579 --> 3594.5
doesn't that just look amazing

3597.96 --> 3606.299
with that clear blue in between

3602.16 --> 3609.74
this heavily shaded and lit up clouds

3606.299 --> 3609.74
it's just a beautiful picture

3616.44 --> 3619.099
all right

3624.38 --> 3627.7200000000003
hey stopping traffic I'm gonna rest

3626.7 --> 3630.4399999999996
ahead

3627.72 --> 3630.4399999999996
good morning

3631.98 --> 3637.46
almost the same sky here all right

3634.92 --> 3637.46
hmm

3638.04 --> 3641.54
don't need TV

3650.099 --> 3656.48
soon they will paint UFOs in the sky

3653.339 --> 3656.48
I don't think so

3661.859 --> 3668.0
I mean yeah I think that at this point

3664.319 --> 3670.92
they can basically get really weird with

3668.0 --> 3673.2
emulations of celestial lights like they

3670.92 --> 3676.14
could probably like create stars and

3673.2 --> 3678.96
make them move and all that

3676.14 --> 3682.68
but yeah it won't be anything beyond

3678.96 --> 3684.9
like the effect of basically using a

3682.68 --> 3687.4199999999996
laser light on the wall

3684.9 --> 3689.339
to get your dog like what's that what's

3687.42 --> 3692.4
that what's that that I think that's the

3689.339 --> 3693.839
farthest that they can go with all that

3692.4 --> 3696.7200000000003
right

3693.839 --> 3698.16
isn't that what that kind of would be

3696.72 --> 3701.3999999999996
everybody's staring together what's that

3698.16 --> 3704.94
look at that light that's not normal

3701.4 --> 3706.619
and then imagine like the person with

3704.94 --> 3707.76
the technology that's actually doing

3706.619 --> 3711.42
that

3707.76 --> 3714.96
is basically like a laser light shining

3711.42 --> 3717.0
on the celestial apparent Demi sphere

3714.96 --> 3719.9
and just like haha the people are gonna

3717.0 --> 3719.9
freak out of this

3721.559 --> 3726.26
like using a laser pen on the wall with

3723.96 --> 3726.26
your dog

3735.299 --> 3740.64
the glow belief is already augmented

3738.66 --> 3743.72
real what

3740.64 --> 3743.72
what are you talking about

3754.92 --> 3759.78
oh clouds yeah well clouds can literally

3757.74 --> 3762.72
form out of nowhere in the middle of a

3759.78 --> 3765.78
blue sky they can do that

3762.72 --> 3769.16
especially if there's like a little dust

3765.78 --> 3769.1600000000003
and the right conditions

3772.2 --> 3777.4199999999996
I've seen those videos Thursday

3774.38 --> 3781.02
dude I've been into you like UFOs and

3777.42 --> 3785.0
like is this a UFO that's what I was in

3781.02 --> 3785.0
before Flat Earth a lot

3785.16 --> 3790.16
because I was just like what is that

3786.839 --> 3790.16
what is that what is that

3798.18 --> 3803.66
projecting on the dough no no no no

3800.28 --> 3803.6600000000003
there's no such thing

3804.72 --> 3809.16
no projecting

3806.94 --> 3811.44
other holographic lights on the

3809.16 --> 3813.7799999999997
celestial Demi sphere

3811.44 --> 3817.039
like adding their own

3813.78 --> 3817.039
it's not actually

3817.74 --> 3823.7
a reflected light of a physical

3820.92 --> 3823.7000000000003
structure

3824.339 --> 3828.96
so holographic manifestation

3826.859 --> 3832.02
now the physical structure may be

3828.96 --> 3834.359
involved in a physical structure up

3832.02 --> 3838.02
there of some sort may be involved in

3834.359 --> 3840.66
how it holographically manifests but

3838.02 --> 3842.7
it's not like literally a mirror or

3840.66 --> 3844.859
something that a light shines against

3842.7 --> 3848.64
and then you see it reflected that's not

3844.859 --> 3848.64
how that works obviously

3850.14 --> 3855.66
where's the source of delayed oh squirt

3853.98 --> 3858.72
for me

3855.66 --> 3861.66
it's holographic it manifests I don't

3858.72 --> 3863.7
know how that happens it just does

3861.66 --> 3865.68
it's not coming from anywhere you can't

3863.7 --> 3867.66
trace the source it's there though

3865.68 --> 3870.5389999999998
including the Sun

3867.66 --> 3873.0589999999997
which you can't trace either

3870.539 --> 3875.7000000000003
right where's the Icarus project

3873.059 --> 3877.5
let's let's see a video of gutting close

3875.7 --> 3878.819
in the angular size of the sun

3877.5 --> 3881.76
increasing

3878.819 --> 3884.579
and then reading like well the

3881.76 --> 3888.0
correlating temperature increase that

3884.579 --> 3890.039
must happen over distance

3888.0 --> 3892.76
if it was actually an object in a

3890.039 --> 3892.76
euclidean position

3893.46 --> 3897.44
and there isn't any of that so

3897.539 --> 3902.4
I don't know how it's manifesting I'm

3900.119 --> 3904.7400000000002
sorry I'm sorry that you can't quickly

3902.4 --> 3908.099
on a whim to your own satisfaction

3904.74 --> 3911.0989999999997
create an entire emulator for the design

3908.099 --> 3913.6800000000003
of physical reality I'm sorry yeah I

3911.099 --> 3915.48
can't do that

3913.68 --> 3917.64
it's no guarantee that anybody could

3915.48 --> 3920.94
ever do that although I think that they

3917.64 --> 3924.18
are already able to basically

3920.94 --> 3927.78
add holographic lights to the celestial

3924.18 --> 3927.7799999999997
atmosphere somehow

3927.9 --> 3931.38
that's it

3929.28 --> 3933.3590000000004
it's a suspicion I don't have any

3931.38 --> 3935.76
definitive evidence of that

3933.359 --> 3939.5
it just seems like okay if they have

3935.76 --> 3939.5
things to do something

3939.78 --> 3945.6800000000003
and

3941.599 --> 3948.539
explaining typical light based sightings

3945.68 --> 3953.299
correlating with UFO sightings

3948.539 --> 3953.2990000000004
then yeah maybe they can do that

3953.579 --> 3961.02
or let's see some proximity

3957.72 --> 3963.66
let's see you getting closer like oh fly

3961.02 --> 3966.48
towards it oh the light goes bigger and

3963.66 --> 3970.2599999999998
oh suddenly you can see a contour right

3966.48 --> 3973.02
that's sign of physical nature approach

3970.26 --> 3975.7990000000004
if you don't have that it could be a

3973.02 --> 3975.799
Celestial like

3981.48 --> 3987.26
no please new projector was shine flying

3984.359 --> 3987.2599999999998
sources of the cloud

3992.46 --> 3995.119
okay

4020.0 --> 4023.0
foreign

4042.579 --> 4048.1400000000003
service day yeah you have a great

4045.2 --> 4051.16
Saturday too I hope you score

4048.14 --> 4051.16
a lot of metal

4054.26 --> 4058.4
it is beautiful weather so there is a

4056.599 --> 4059.42
lot likelihood that people are gonna

4058.4 --> 4062.38
like

4059.42 --> 4062.38
get to work

4063.38 --> 4069.98
and that's the time

4065.66 --> 4073.24
where they leave metal things and

4069.98 --> 4073.2400000000002
outside so

4074.059 --> 4078.7000000000003
share the load of oh that's cool man

4076.039 --> 4078.7000000000003
that's cool

4083.9 --> 4088.76
and try tonight out and get some Yanks

4086.359 --> 4091.42
in here maybe maybe I'm gonna do that at

4088.76 --> 4091.42
some point but

4091.579 --> 4094.2400000000002
like

4094.88 --> 4099.5
like really earlier when I was starting

4097.339 --> 4103.4
up the early bird people were like oh

4099.5 --> 4108.94
just do the night I'll show also oh yeah

4103.4 --> 4108.94
oh just do a second Daily Show

4109.46 --> 4115.46
but right but if for some reason at some

4112.04 --> 4119.54
point I decide to basically drop this

4115.46 --> 4123.199
specific format then I might continue on

4119.54 --> 4125.06
with doing it night owl shows though but

4123.199 --> 4127.5199999999995
I don't know with my rhythm and

4125.06 --> 4130.279
everything it doesn't really work out

4127.52 --> 4134.6
because this and as even argued this

4130.279 --> 4138.819
very early on this time slot is when I

4134.6 --> 4138.819
kind of like have my most clarity

4141.38 --> 4148.46
and then yeah due to habits and all that

4145.4 --> 4149.659
I kind of like drink a couple of beers

4148.46 --> 4154.359
later

4149.659 --> 4154.3589999999995
and then it's it's just a different me

4157.48 --> 4164.239
it's evening me and

4161.48 --> 4166.459999999999
that works just fine if I'm like with

4164.239 --> 4169.218999999999
other people and I don't have to like

4166.46 --> 4172.0
take the front seat

4169.219 --> 4172.0
constantly

4172.52 --> 4178.219
but like I with the way I live right now

4175.819 --> 4180.859
it's just it wouldn't work to have like

4178.219 --> 4182.42
an evening show in this format and I

4180.859 --> 4184.88
couldn't do it

4182.42 --> 4186.859
I mean I might sometimes like take a

4184.88 --> 4188.2390000000005
moment and like Oh Let's do an idol show

4186.859 --> 4192.14
because

4188.239 --> 4194.299
like we need to get this out right now

4192.14 --> 4196.1
and this happened before

4194.299 --> 4198.5199999999995
but that's always going to be kind of a

4196.1 --> 4198.52
rare thing

4208.64 --> 4214.04
oh I'm in the US this time works great

4210.86 --> 4217.04
yeah well it is for early birds this

4214.04 --> 4219.46
show is for the US early birds and there

4217.04 --> 4219.46
are some

4222.4 --> 4228.139999999999
so basically yeah including farmers

4225.739 --> 4230.718999999999
which especially if you have animals you

4228.14 --> 4232.400000000001
have to get up really early I don't know

4230.719 --> 4234.5
though how many farmers that are

4232.4 --> 4237.259999999999
actually really farming would like to

4234.5 --> 4240.679
listen to me maybe I'm a little bit too

4237.26 --> 4244.84
left field for them on average

4240.679 --> 4244.84
or maybe I'm just right I don't know

4245.78 --> 4251.78
but yeah

4248.0 --> 4254.719
my show was originally kind of aimed at

4251.78 --> 4256.94
the early up people in the United States

4254.719 --> 4259.3
because when I start my show it's really

4256.94 --> 4262.879999999999
early in the United States

4259.3 --> 4266.42
and also it's kind of tough

4262.88 --> 4269.6
when it's really early to find an early

4266.42 --> 4272.08
show to your liking I mean there are

4269.6 --> 4275.0
morning shows out there all kinds

4272.08 --> 4276.5199999999995
especially on TV but yeah that's

4275.0 --> 4279.02
freaking TV

4276.52 --> 4281.4800000000005
and it's gonna be filled with [ __ ]

4279.02 --> 4283.1
and programming

4281.48 --> 4285.62
so

4283.1 --> 4287.120000000001
yeah that was the original concept for

4285.62 --> 4290.12
this show

4287.12 --> 4293.239
and I think I've maintained

4290.12 --> 4295.96
that the cohesion for that

4293.239 --> 4295.959999999999
pretty well

4297.98 --> 4303.379999999999
you don't like early mornings

4301.04 --> 4305.5
all right yeah well not everybody likes

4303.38 --> 4305.5
that

4307.219 --> 4312.52
I mean I don't really like early

4309.199 --> 4312.5199999999995
mornings unless

4313.52 --> 4318.1990000000005
unless I've arrived in the phase where I

4316.28 --> 4320.239
do

4318.199 --> 4323.78
and then I really like early mornings it

4320.239 --> 4327.82
usually doesn't last super long

4323.78 --> 4327.82
couple of weeks a month

4329.48 --> 4333.639999999999
all right but that's also because I

4331.34 --> 4336.62
don't have any standard super early

4333.64 --> 4338.179
responsibilities like animals

4336.62 --> 4339.679
or a dog

4338.179 --> 4343.4
because if you have a dog you usually

4339.679 --> 4346.719
have to get up pretty early too

4343.4 --> 4346.719
I yeah

4361.699 --> 4367.04
having a one world time getting rid of

4364.28 --> 4368.84
time zones and all that

4367.04 --> 4371.62
I don't know algae I don't know if

4368.84 --> 4371.62
that's practical

4373.58 --> 4380.239
but I do think that like the weird

4377.179 --> 4382.46
daytime night what is it the summertime

4380.239 --> 4385.639999999999
winter time

4382.46 --> 4387.92
that the shift

4385.64 --> 4390.5
with that because I do appreciate that

4387.92 --> 4393.8
system oh and Benjamin also but he

4390.5 --> 4396.92
explained about that why that's useful

4393.8 --> 4400.34
especially if you're like farming

4396.92 --> 4402.14
so I'm not for taking that away the

4400.34 --> 4404.900000000001
difference between winter time and

4402.14 --> 4408.02
summertime but it should be synchronized

4404.9 --> 4410.54
because now there's this weird moment it

4408.02 --> 4413.84
happened like a few weeks ago

4410.54 --> 4416.84
where suddenly Europe switches an hour

4413.84 --> 4419.02
and then America doesn't it it does it a

4416.84 --> 4421.46
week later that's very confusing

4419.02 --> 4423.860000000001
unnecessarily right if that could be

4421.46 --> 4426.34
synchronized then I think everything's

4423.86 --> 4426.339999999999
just fine

4426.62 --> 4429.58
but that's me

4434.54 --> 4439.58
I watched Capricorn one last night it is

4436.94 --> 4441.32
epic yeah it is especially for that time

4439.58 --> 4444.1
it is fascinating

4441.32 --> 4444.099999999999
isn't it

4448.4 --> 4454.36
like to me what stood out most is it was

4451.219 --> 4454.36
that scene where they just

4454.88 --> 4459.92
burn

4457.04 --> 4461.6
like put a flame thrower on like the

4459.92 --> 4463.46
space shuttle or something something

4461.6 --> 4466.1
like that where they just show that and

4463.46 --> 4468.62
don't really say why like that was

4466.1 --> 4471.860000000001
really freaky

4468.62 --> 4473.659
and like if you don't understand Flat

4471.86 --> 4475.699
Earth and the space fake read then

4473.659 --> 4478.219
you're gonna be like really puzzled as

4475.699 --> 4482.199
to what you're looking at

4478.219 --> 4482.199
that makes it extra fascinating

4490.04 --> 4493.48
oh come on Cleary

4495.32 --> 4498.32
hey

4500.659 --> 4503.659
guys

4509.78 --> 4515.239
why'd you have to go there is that

4511.64 --> 4518.4400000000005
what's like that's the thing that that

4515.239 --> 4518.44
that's taking to mind

4528.5 --> 4533.0
9 A.M is too early for listening to

4531.32 --> 4536.199
baller squirt

4533.0 --> 4536.199
yeah I agree

4537.32 --> 4545.739
unfortunately I cannot guarantee

4541.1 --> 4545.7390000000005
that you won't be reading baller squirt

4545.84 --> 4552.400000000001
because I I kind of do use them as study

4549.199 --> 4552.4
material so

4556.159 --> 4561.08
but yeah some days there will be Ballers

4558.5 --> 4564.02
and some days there will just be talk

4561.08 --> 4567.199
about movies and

4564.02 --> 4570.7390000000005
health tips

4567.199 --> 4573.28
talk about food maybe a little and

4570.739 --> 4573.28
and

4576.04 --> 4579.46
worldly things

4585.02 --> 4591.6990000000005
and sometimes spiritual things

4588.32 --> 4591.699
a lot more these days

4598.04 --> 4602.06
all right and

4600.86 --> 4605.0
yeah

4602.06 --> 4606.38
and maybe at some point Flat Earth too

4605.0 --> 4608.239
of course if there's like really

4606.38 --> 4610.04
interesting new developments that are

4608.239 --> 4612.799999999999
like really new

4610.04 --> 4614.98
then I will drag it in here of course I

4612.8 --> 4614.9800000000005
will

4615.5 --> 4618.82
right but

4618.86 --> 4624.08
like most of the development right now

4621.199 --> 4628.5199999999995
is just kind of like finer detailing

4624.08 --> 4631.34
work of our Victorious trophies

4628.52 --> 4633.26
right that's what it is now and like the

4631.34 --> 4635.78
guys from the flare debates are very

4633.26 --> 4637.9400000000005
proficient at that sort of thing

4635.78 --> 4639.199
for me personally I find it a little

4637.94 --> 4644.0
boring

4639.199 --> 4646.94
but yeah it it's useful you know

4644.0 --> 4649.159
it's just not really my thing and so

4646.94 --> 4651.5
I've been diving much more into the

4649.159 --> 4655.48
psychology overall because there's still

4651.5 --> 4655.48
a lot of ground to be worked on there

4658.46 --> 4663.14
reach out to the Yankees the more views

4661.88 --> 4666.1990000000005
the better

4663.14 --> 4668.179
they don't agree who cares

4666.199 --> 4670.339999999999
well you do realize if there's going to

4668.179 --> 4672.86
be more viewers more Americans that's

4670.34 --> 4676.78
also going to be more Ballers more

4672.86 --> 4676.78
squirting also

4683.54 --> 4688.78
properly

4686.06 --> 4688.780000000001
we'll see

4698.84 --> 4703.06
America is a childish pit okay

4706.76 --> 4712.360000000001
yeah there does seem to be a systemic

4709.4 --> 4712.36
cultural problem

4712.52 --> 4718.179
like a a behavioral responsibility

4716.42 --> 4720.1990000000005
problem

4718.179 --> 4721.9400000000005
although it's

4720.199 --> 4724.82
it's kind of throughout the Western

4721.94 --> 4729.46
world like Europe has it too

4724.82 --> 4729.46
but America seems to like really have it

4729.86 --> 4735.639999999999
like people take things very very far

4733.28 --> 4735.639999999999
there

4743.3 --> 4748.64
so what you got great mods here yeah I'm

4746.9 --> 4750.739
not saying that it couldn't work I'm not

4748.64 --> 4753.320000000001
like trying to make an excuse not to do

4750.739 --> 4756.86
it I mean I've already given you one for

4753.32 --> 4758.96
that and that is if it's late I'm not

4756.86 --> 4761.62
gonna be in optimal condition to do

4758.96 --> 4764.56
something like this

4761.62 --> 4767.36
unless there is something really

4764.56 --> 4769.820000000001
happening something that really makes it

4767.36 --> 4772.659
worth doing that and that would provide

4769.82 --> 4772.659
the extra energy

4774.32 --> 4779.62
like a special News Bulletin type of

4777.199 --> 4779.62
thing right

4782.0 --> 4790.4
even older people act like yes yes

4786.64 --> 4792.6990000000005
that is something rest you make a good

4790.4 --> 4792.699
point

4794.6 --> 4797.4400000000005
yes

4799.159 --> 4805.299999999999
that's

4801.5 --> 4805.3
really something isn't it

4805.58 --> 4811.639
because like around here

4809.12 --> 4815.599999999999
older people tend to be

4811.639 --> 4818.0
wiser they're not all perfect they're

4815.6 --> 4820.400000000001
not always even super modest but they

4818.0 --> 4826.179
really

4820.4 --> 4826.179
are like trying to be older and wiser

4827.0 --> 4833.48
a lot of them or just trying to get as

4830.36 --> 4836.719
much attention as possible but

4833.48 --> 4840.199
in America it's like

4836.719 --> 4842.6
it's like they a lot of the times

4840.199 --> 4845.96
it's not even normal

4842.6 --> 4847.159000000001
that the elders should behave older and

4845.96 --> 4849.08
wiser

4847.159 --> 4852.699
weird

4849.08 --> 4852.699
now that you're mentioning it yeah

4875.12 --> 4879.44
you could do one yeah the gadget

4877.34 --> 4882.860000000001
inspector drop it I know what you're

4879.44 --> 4885.919999999999
doing you're you're pushing it again

4882.86 --> 4888.639
you are not going to make me now do a

4885.92 --> 4888.639
night owl show

4892.639 --> 4900.7390000000005
not weekly either no sorry

4897.32 --> 4904.34
I'm doing this show every day

4900.739 --> 4907.879999999999
unless I'm like super late or feeling

4904.34 --> 4911.1990000000005
kind of sick then I don't but that's

4907.88 --> 4911.1990000000005
that's already plenty

4921.32 --> 4926.36
reckons I know why why would they do

4924.26 --> 4929.7390000000005
that

4926.36 --> 4929.739
what's in it for them

4943.58 --> 4946.12
right

4948.02 --> 4951.76
like they have no

4953.96 --> 4957.62
no

4955.42 --> 4959.719
do you say that

4957.62 --> 4962.12
they don't work like that China doesn't

4959.719 --> 4964.94
work like that China is always about

4962.12 --> 4967.639
freaking business and are they engaging

4964.94 --> 4970.28
in business Wars oh yeah

4967.639 --> 4972.86
it's the age of the gravel it is the New

4970.28 --> 4975.92
World Order corporate conspiracy and

4972.86 --> 4977.78
they are meddling trying to

4975.92 --> 4980.4800000000005
do that too

4977.78 --> 4984.259999999999
but like a hot War

4980.48 --> 4988.0
with actual weapons and explosions what

4984.26 --> 4991.34
why would they do that they're not

4988.0 --> 4993.639
designed to do that like their system is

4991.34 --> 4993.639
not

4993.98 --> 5001.44
for that they don't even have a history

4997.4 --> 5001.44
of doing a starting Wars

5001.84 --> 5005.92
for real but they meddle right they

5004.78 --> 5008.38
Meddle

5005.92 --> 5012.58
they don't start wars they don't start

5008.38 --> 5015.52
hot Wars they don't operate like that

5012.58 --> 5017.5599999999995
so I don't see that I think that if

5015.52 --> 5020.5
anything America is going to start a war

5017.56 --> 5022.42
because their gravel Elite is just

5020.5 --> 5023.44
completely losing control and what do

5022.42 --> 5026.26
you do

5023.44 --> 5028.419999999999
either you perish or you distract

5026.26 --> 5031.0
Everybody by starting a hot War but

5028.42 --> 5034.1990000000005
everything collapses then

5031.0 --> 5037.84
right there's a lot of

5034.199 --> 5040.12
dependency on International Trade that's

5037.84 --> 5041.7390000000005
just slipped in there for a long period

5040.12 --> 5044.26
of time

5041.739 --> 5048.099999999999
so like

5044.26 --> 5049.6
there's more to lose

5048.1 --> 5052.659000000001
now

5049.6 --> 5055.26
if an actual world war starts compared

5052.659 --> 5058.54
to say a hundred years ago

5055.26 --> 5061.2390000000005
when there was not that higher

5058.54 --> 5063.94
dependency on International Trade you

5061.239 --> 5068.58
see that all goes away very quickly when

5063.94 --> 5068.58
a hot war starts very quickly

5068.679 --> 5073.9
right now it's like oh no there might be

5071.199 --> 5077.379999999999
a food shortage here yeah well if an

5073.9 --> 5080.138999999999
actual a hot world war starts

5077.38 --> 5081.159000000001
you don't have to like look at this like

5080.139 --> 5083.02
suddenly

5081.159 --> 5085.78
it's just nothing coming in anymore

5083.02 --> 5087.820000000001
because like there's blockades

5085.78 --> 5089.8
everywhere

5087.82 --> 5092.0199999999995
and suddenly there's just no more

5089.8 --> 5095.5
products coming from anywhere

5092.02 --> 5097.780000000001
right the disaster would be unbelievable

5095.5 --> 5101.56
and also that would

5097.78 --> 5104.199
make upholding a hard War even tougher

5101.56 --> 5106.360000000001
because what you're gonna be left with a

5104.199 --> 5108.46
ravage even if it doesn't get blown up

5106.36 --> 5111.219
you see so

5108.46 --> 5114.46
yeah no I don't think China has any

5111.219 --> 5117.219
interest in starting a hot War at all

5114.46 --> 5119.679
they have interest in in gravel they

5117.219 --> 5121.12
have interest well lit if interested

5119.679 --> 5124.0
interest

5121.12 --> 5127.26
they want to have Financial control

5124.0 --> 5127.26
that's what they like

5138.1 --> 5144.4800000000005
too busy pumping Africa right that's on

5140.98 --> 5144.48
their project list right now

5154.9 --> 5160.719
is the UK weaker or stronger since

5157.84 --> 5163.860000000001
leaving the EU

5160.719 --> 5163.86
in what sense

5166.239 --> 5171.459999999999
is it more independent is it financially

5169.36 --> 5174.219
stronger

5171.46 --> 5175.6
is it militarily stronger

5174.219 --> 5177.52
what

5175.6 --> 5181.06
What specifically

5177.52 --> 5184.620000000001
I mean they did take a bit of a dig on

5181.06 --> 5184.620000000001
business but they've definitely

5184.739 --> 5189.94
maintained Imperial Integrity let's just

5188.26 --> 5191.58
say it like that

5189.94 --> 5193.839999999999
it's just

5191.58 --> 5196.3
business-wise it's it's a lot of

5193.84 --> 5198.28
complications

5196.3 --> 5200.38
but

5198.28 --> 5203.639
I don't think like the loss has been

5200.38 --> 5203.639
like really devastating

5203.86 --> 5208.92
it's just a lot of hassle it's not as

5206.32 --> 5208.92
convenient

5228.58 --> 5233.32
the UK is little England I don't know

5231.28 --> 5236.34
what that means Gadget inspector I don't

5233.32 --> 5236.34
know what that refers to

5248.98 --> 5252.659
now they are divided

5256.3 --> 5260.159000000001
what are you talking about rest ahead

5269.32 --> 5274.42
that that doesn't work out rest that if

5271.78 --> 5277.86
you're just gonna say wow dumb what is

5274.42 --> 5277.86
wow dumb who are you talking to

5285.42 --> 5288.659
SKS okay

5289.78 --> 5294.58
yeah I don't agree like I don't think

5292.42 --> 5298.0
any of that is like physically there's

5294.58 --> 5300.58
not like a physical thing

5298.0 --> 5303.84
like all of that is spiritual

5300.58 --> 5303.84
and it's already happening

5306.28 --> 5311.62
brexit destroyed great bit did it okay

5309.04 --> 5314.76
this did it really

5311.62 --> 5314.76
based on what

5336.76 --> 5345.6
yeah islesjiva we do

5340.06 --> 5345.6
we but the world system is financial

5345.88 --> 5353.86
they're the ones also using their power

5350.62 --> 5356.739
now to manipulate everybody and try to

5353.86 --> 5358.98
turn the whole world into a neo-futal

5356.739 --> 5358.98
system

5360.1 --> 5365.320000000001
under control of Mega financiers and

5363.04 --> 5368.1
corporations

5365.32 --> 5368.099999999999
so yeah

5377.98 --> 5383.699
I live in the UK the EU is that's why

5380.739 --> 5383.699
are you getting all that

5403.06 --> 5410.92
I mean the EU obviously blatantly

5407.139 --> 5412.84
obviously has many big problems

5410.92 --> 5414.9400000000005
problems that are not going to be solved

5412.84 --> 5417.219
that cannot be solved

5414.94 --> 5420.099999999999
and the way to solve is is to literally

5417.219 --> 5421.659
kick the majority out of the unelected

5420.1 --> 5424.96
parliament

5421.659 --> 5427.48
that they're using to to try to make

5424.96 --> 5430.2390000000005
Europe into an Empire which they are

5427.48 --> 5433.0599999999995
kind of blatantly trying to do

5430.239 --> 5435.879999999999
but nobody's buying it nobody really

5433.06 --> 5438.04
wants that except for people that are

5435.88 --> 5440.7390000000005
part of the financier in corporate

5438.04 --> 5442.54
conspiracy

5440.739 --> 5444.638999999999
you could call them the freaking

5442.54 --> 5446.32
communists

5444.639 --> 5448.5
because effectively that's what they're

5446.32 --> 5448.5
doing

5453.94 --> 5459.96
most of the EU money was from the UK

5456.94 --> 5459.96
where are you getting that

5464.8 --> 5467.58
no

5467.62 --> 5473.199
I mean I bet the contributions were

5471.04 --> 5476.139
significant

5473.199 --> 5478.719
it's not the most dude all the countries

5476.139 --> 5481.4800000000005
pay a lot like the Netherlands pays

5478.719 --> 5485.159
insane amounts to Europe

5481.48 --> 5485.159
like really insane

5495.639 --> 5503.08
our smaller country but like

5498.699 --> 5504.339999999999
per capita like we pay insane amounts

5503.08 --> 5506.699
say Europe

5504.34 --> 5509.7390000000005
just by executive orders like oh no

5506.699 --> 5512.739
Netherlands is just gonna do that just

5509.739 --> 5514.739
like there you go a couple of billion or

5512.739 --> 5517.54
something

5514.739 --> 5520.799999999999
insane and there's nothing we could do

5517.54 --> 5520.8
about it they just do it

5521.139 --> 5526.179
I don't even know how that's possible

5523.78 --> 5528.5199999999995
how they're able to do it just like that

5526.179 --> 5531.159
it's crazy to me

5528.52 --> 5533.34
anyway I think I'm gonna round out the

5531.159 --> 5533.339999999999
show

5549.239 --> 5554.44
yeah the Netherlands yeah but look the

5552.1 --> 5556.3
Netherlands is like

5554.44 --> 5558.04
there's something about the Dutch

5556.3 --> 5559.4800000000005
culture I think

5558.04 --> 5564.46
where it's like

5559.48 --> 5569.5599999999995
the rules like the nitpicky rules

5564.46 --> 5570.52
it's like culturally people do that more

5569.56 --> 5573.04
like

5570.52 --> 5575.38
they're okay with playing games even if

5573.04 --> 5578.56
it makes no sense if they think they can

5575.38 --> 5582.36
get some kind of Advantage out of it

5578.56 --> 5582.360000000001
that's like a really Dutch thing

5584.679 --> 5591.82
yeah how absolutely counter opposite

5588.28 --> 5593.38
am I right but it's just that's the way

5591.82 --> 5595.36
it is out there that's what a lot of

5593.38 --> 5598.3
Dutch people do

5595.36 --> 5601.42
so going like we invented going along to

5598.3 --> 5604.8
get along but kind of good at it

5601.42 --> 5604.8
PayPal sucker

5686.26 --> 5691.179

5697.96 --> 5702.34
I didn't know he was that's it's a

it doesn't actually absolve you from

5729.76 --> 5732.76

you're gonna have to work on that

5732.76 --> 5737.92

willing to work on it

5737.92 --> 5741.719
