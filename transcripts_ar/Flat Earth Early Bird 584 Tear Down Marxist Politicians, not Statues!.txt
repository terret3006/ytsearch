so yeah starting a bit early again

94.19 --> 102.57
couldn't wait yeah mostly you know the

100.53 --> 106.86
weather's very restless it's like this

102.57 --> 109.19999999999999
constant wind it's again clouded it is

106.86 --> 116.13
it's pretty much the same temperature as

109.2 --> 118.0
yesterday be the rain here and there but

116.13 --> 121.47999999999999
yeah

118.0 --> 123.46
the the heatwave is definitely over for

121.48 --> 137.08
now for the time being at least so it

123.46 --> 139.04999999999998
seems but yes it could be worse it's

137.08 --> 145.39000000000001
good to have a break from the heat

139.05 --> 150.61
anyway let's you it isn't yet okay I

145.39 --> 160.29
think a gem was first you Yuri in the

150.61 --> 160.29000000000002
Hubble asks I do not speak Norse sorry

163.05 --> 169.09
apparently you do speak Dutch

165.66 --> 179.49
at least you're you're showing that in

169.09 --> 185.4
chat anyway yeah I'm and a young Steve

179.49 --> 185.4
Robert Stanley getting sick or J Oh

186.15 --> 194.82
Braco Tom Parker yeah good to see you

189.34 --> 194.82
all starting with early so yeah

201.89 --> 206.57999999999998
I've had a very restless night - no I

204.99 --> 210.84
didn't even do anything out of the

206.58 --> 216.72000000000003
ordinary really drank less than usual

210.84 --> 219.56900000000002
and it was just very restless ideas

216.72 --> 221.58
dancing around in my head and yeah me

219.569 --> 224.0
remembering like oh yeah I put that down

221.58 --> 224.0
again

226.58 --> 232.62
also yeah I am starting to notice - I

229.62 --> 236.1
was on ayran Romania this morning or not

232.62 --> 237.87
on it in the chat it was a pretty big

236.1 --> 240.89
panels and very cool

237.87 --> 246.209
I listened life to at least half of it

240.89 --> 250.10999999999999
and yeah I noticed that they literally

246.209 --> 252.18
used the picture that was made for the

250.11 --> 256.2
time that I came on I own real media

252.18 --> 260.729
like in their in their slide show so I

256.2 --> 265.14
was like oh okay cool wow they put me in

260.729 --> 268.68
there it's funny just okay I guess I'm

265.14 --> 271.46999999999997
worthy enough to put forward now anyway

268.68 --> 273.63
that was nice to see that also already

271.47 --> 277.83000000000004
at the Flat Earth debate you know also I

273.63 --> 282.32
got my own photo as well it's I don't

277.83 --> 282.32
know I feel honored I hope I'm worth it

284.09 --> 294.44
mmm yeah I haven't actually watched back

289.89 --> 294.44
yesterday's episode didn't get very far

296.479 --> 300.5
did watch on Benjamin

308.44 --> 312.87
I know

313.25 --> 324.61
but I have to get into that again in my

315.68 --> 327.68
mind or somebody could remind me but I

324.61 --> 334.52000000000004
didn't go to bed too late I was just so

327.68 --> 336.89
Restless it's like juggling with these

334.52 --> 338.29999999999995
perspectives also you know the thing

336.89 --> 341.0
that I put down about the fourth

338.3 --> 345.41
dimensional thing well that is kind of

341.0 --> 347.72
that has been like my model approach to

345.41 --> 349.97
make sense of part of what I've

347.72 --> 353.27000000000004
experienced like that the mechanics

349.97 --> 355.79
behind it and every time I do bring it

353.27 --> 360.44
up I yeah I do typically get restless

355.79 --> 362.84000000000003
it's like get even more fired up and

360.44 --> 364.669
trying to figure it out and also this

362.84 --> 366.73999999999995
weird yeah

364.669 --> 368.63
struggle that I seem to have with my

366.74 --> 370.93
well what I can only describe as my

368.63 --> 374.51
subconscious or me on the other side

370.93 --> 376.22
that it just seemed to disagree with or

374.51 --> 381.38
at least the memories that I have of

376.22 --> 388.90000000000003
that a lot and also that he apparently

381.38 --> 395.63
just had a great misunderstanding of

388.9 --> 400.9
like the way things work from the

395.63 --> 400.9
perspective of how things work there

402.66 --> 407.71000000000004
right and that's yeah that's just

405.729 --> 409.75
something that that's constantly pulling

407.71 --> 411.69899999999996
me back into thinking about all that

409.75 --> 413.68
stuff like yeah yeah yeah I'm

411.699 --> 420.729
cross-referencing comparing more and

413.68 --> 424.71
more and more are my drawings in one

420.729 --> 427.21
place or in one early bird for review

424.71 --> 429.729
they're kind of like the drawings I

427.21 --> 432.48999999999995
showed yesterday yeah I showed them

429.729 --> 437.729
yesterday I also showed them on several

432.49 --> 440.71000000000004
hangouts from my flat earth talks and

437.729 --> 445.36
you will be able to kind of find it by

440.71 --> 447.13
the title but yeah I have two collection

445.36 --> 451.509
here I'm a computer I haven't really put

447.13 --> 456.37
it anywhere online you know you never

451.509 --> 459.19
really put like my own website together

456.37 --> 461.86
a lot of people do that I've never

459.19 --> 464.41
really done that other than for my yeah

461.86 --> 467.639
for my D&D book because that is

464.41 --> 478.65900000000005
basically the form in which I publish it

467.639 --> 482.32
or whatever it's worth but well thank

478.659 --> 485.31
you know look if I'm if I would put

482.32 --> 488.4
those types of things then maybe

485.31 --> 493.72
somewhere maybe you should do it in

488.4 --> 495.669
where's this at ready calm next to my

493.72 --> 497.44000000000005
history of the dimensions of existence

495.669 --> 501.94
because that yeah that definitely

497.44 --> 504.669
relates so for those that haven't

501.94 --> 506.8
watched that yeah I wrote that and

504.669 --> 512.38
posted it like two years ago talked

506.8 --> 516.089
about it many times back then it's my

512.38 --> 518.829
very raw estimation of the periods of

516.089 --> 521.7700000000001
yeah of creation that includes like

518.829 --> 528.13
everything not just that the normal 3d

521.77 --> 530.37
reality and and what the dimensions are

528.13 --> 530.37
like

530.95 --> 542.0500000000001
right it's kind of big thing and it fits

536.12 --> 544.82
on one page like the plague just saying

542.05 --> 547.4499999999999
avoid write it like the plague oops

544.82 --> 547.45
alright

548.79 --> 556.11
[Music]

561.81 --> 566.6099999999999
well you know what I normally do no

565.17 --> 571.05
don't really do that kind of thing but I

566.61 --> 574.259
could potentially just make a separate

571.05 --> 578.579
hangout where I don't have yeah all this

574.259 --> 581.069
stuff surrounding me and it's just the

578.579 --> 584.7299999999999
view of the pictures in the background

581.069 --> 586.529
and then me like in a little window in a

584.73 --> 588.149
corner like oh how a lot of people there

586.529 --> 591.24
with these days it does kind of look

588.149 --> 594.329
more professional and then basically

591.24 --> 596.1
share the up-close versions with

594.329 --> 599.939
everybody and talk about it just all

596.1 --> 602.73
these drawings like reviewing my own

599.939 --> 604.279
drawings I guess I could do a separate

602.73 --> 611.879
video about that

604.279 --> 617.069
maybe there's yeah laughter um I have to

611.879 --> 620.6700000000001
make a note about that trying to make

617.069 --> 631.519
notes more so if things don't just slip

620.67 --> 635.55
me by do a lecture a lecture

631.519 --> 641.579
well that would sort of be the same

635.55 --> 649.05
thing but look at it it's basically just

641.579 --> 651.9899999999999
working with cosmogony what that is that

649.05 --> 654.809
discussion with reaction maybe Robin

651.99 --> 659.189
Stanley well maybe we're never really

654.809 --> 662.809
considered that even I could do it if I

659.189 --> 662.809
have the materials ready at hand

667.69 --> 671.0400000000001
all right anyway

671.84 --> 675.5500000000001
making the note on paper

690.19 --> 697.72
yeah but technically you know the first

695.23 --> 700.5690000000001
hangout that I did was kind of exactly

697.72 --> 703.389
that it was exactly what I did I did

700.569 --> 708.25
basically show the drawing several

703.389 --> 712.17
drawings I think and then just yeah

708.25 --> 712.17
explain about them anyway

713.279 --> 722.23
what do a class that people can sign up

717.129 --> 726.66
for hundred bucks each why who the

722.23 --> 729.339
hell's gonna do that it's like yeah why

726.66 --> 735.9699999999999
you know yeah learn about Cosmo Jeannie

729.339 --> 742.3290000000001
but it did I don't know man maybe if I'm

735.97 --> 745.6
or favors or something let's not start

742.329 --> 747.0999999999999
out with that let will be good yeah look

745.6 --> 749.649
if I'm gonna have like a paid

747.1 --> 752.9200000000001
presentation situation then I kind of

749.649 --> 755.41
like need to get presentations that I'm

752.92 --> 759.04
like willing to repeat like two thousand

755.41 --> 765.699
times you know cuz if you just slap [ __ ]

759.04 --> 770.189
together yeah and you oh yeah anyway so

765.699 --> 770.189
you get serious for what good servants

771.54 --> 781.569
get serious students but to what end

777.389 --> 785.35
but what why sorry I'm being such a

781.569 --> 788.49
stick-in-the-mud here and not to prove

785.35 --> 788.49
the globe by the way but

800.25 --> 805.089
to help people grow

801.94 --> 805.089
[Music]

805.379 --> 810.79
happen

807.58 --> 816.19
I don't know good servant I don't know

810.79 --> 819.9399999999999
look to really get into this cosmogony

816.19 --> 825.61
that I'm doing you have to like really

819.94 --> 827.86
be past the globe and the lies because

825.61 --> 829.42
if you're still like Paul towards that

827.86 --> 831.07
you're just gonna be bickering and

829.42 --> 833.56
comparing it to the globe constantly

831.07 --> 836.61
like everybody does including myself at

833.56 --> 841.8399999999999
times you know because this cosmogony

836.61 --> 844.65
thinking it's very tough to just model

841.84 --> 847.7800000000001
the entire world and even try to draw in

844.65 --> 849.76
surreal conceptions in order to make

847.78 --> 853.0
things work in different ways it's

849.76 --> 855.1
incredibly straining and you need a lot

853.0 --> 857.74
of room in your head I don't know if

855.1 --> 859.96
enough people would have that you know I

857.74 --> 861.79
think they would probably look at it I

859.96 --> 864.13
don't know I think sometimes people are

861.79 --> 866.68
looking at me because it's like wow I

864.13 --> 869.14
don't get what he's doing but it feels

866.68 --> 873.2199999999999
cool and we go yeah let's just see what

869.14 --> 875.88
happens and yeah the other time that I

873.22 --> 880.72
put down the fourth dimensional concept

875.88 --> 882.52
that just became more apparent people

880.72 --> 887.1700000000001
are just staring at it and just like

882.52 --> 889.48
what like they're seeing a science

887.17 --> 893.92
fiction movie scene unfolding or

889.48 --> 897.04
something instead of actually trying to

893.92 --> 899.4599999999999
follow the mechanism that I'm trying to

897.04 --> 899.4599999999999
highlight

901.7 --> 910.07
yeah no difficulties but yeah I like the

908.27 --> 914.87
idea of at least giving a presentation

910.07 --> 918.5
but to really know the thing is if there

914.87 --> 921.77
is animal for Cosmo Cheney and like get

918.5 --> 923.42
modeling with their L you know that's

921.77 --> 931.04
almost like the course name you like

923.42 --> 933.14
modeling with the realm but I understand

931.04 --> 933.8
the long thing I don't know I don't know

933.14 --> 937.73
if that will work

933.8 --> 940.01
you know sure working like in between

937.73 --> 941.15
other presentations like at a conference

940.01 --> 945.56
that could work

941.15 --> 949.4
sure I'd actually kind of love the idea

945.56 --> 952.3299999999999
I even did back then but it was just too

949.4 --> 952.3299999999999
flustered and nervous

954.88 --> 957.98
[Music]

959.47 --> 965.6800000000001
the thing is something basically for

963.649 --> 967.65
those who actually would be interesting

965.68 --> 970.75
right

967.65 --> 970.75
[Music]

971.09 --> 977.84
well maybe it could try to approach it a

975.36 --> 982.11
little bit more simple and just base the

977.84 --> 984.33
realm possibility exploration like the

982.11 --> 988.49
exploration of what the possibilities

984.33 --> 991.14
might be and focus on that based

988.49 --> 993.9300000000001
centered around the mechanic of

991.14 --> 996.93
presupposition like clearing that up

993.93 --> 998.6099999999999
every step of the way like I could even

996.93 --> 1000.92
do that with this slide show

998.61 --> 1002.39
presentation like showing a tree and

1000.92 --> 1005.68
like okay if you're gonna presuppose

1002.39 --> 1008.9
this right then this is excluded that is

1005.68 --> 1012.38
enforced presuppose then you move on to

1008.9 --> 1014.75
the next step and you have to presuppose

1012.38 --> 1017.66
this mechanic then that excludes other

1014.75 --> 1020.9
factors in this closes this direction

1017.66 --> 1024.17
and then I could really describe like we

1020.9 --> 1029.17
had the tree of presuppositional

1024.17 --> 1032.8700000000001
possibilities of what the realm might be

1029.17 --> 1035.69
like yeah a tree of presupposition of

1032.87 --> 1038.3
potential options with every step that

1035.69 --> 1041.18
could be disproven but yeah you never

1038.3 --> 1050.36
really know you know until it's actually

1041.18 --> 1053.3200000000002
been done I don't know I do like the

1050.36 --> 1053.32
idea a lot

1062.58 --> 1067.05
in a way you know I do this regularly

1064.95 --> 1069.51
even on this show on the flat earth

1067.05 --> 1071.76
debate I I've become very careful with

1069.51 --> 1075.3
my presuppositional structuring it's

1071.76 --> 1077.22
become automated like I don't even have

1075.3 --> 1080.34
to think about it actively like oh wait

1077.22 --> 1083.22
I have to do this now because the

1080.34 --> 1085.83
concepts have been so fine-tuned in my

1083.22 --> 1089.1000000000001
system that it is like official

1085.83 --> 1092.22
mechanism with layers really it's

1089.1 --> 1096.6499999999999
presented in my mind more visual and the

1092.22 --> 1099.0
words just associated with the visuals

1096.65 --> 1103.7900000000002
through just and visualizing and

1099.0 --> 1103.79
comparing have kind of been automated so

1109.09 --> 1114.299
Oh God on paper yeah

1117.88 --> 1126.99
I could try it man but did the know the

1122.44 --> 1126.99
threshold is kind of having high for me

1127.35 --> 1135.1599999999999
but it yeah it might be a worthy project

1130.3 --> 1137.47
a good project for like I haven't been

1135.16 --> 1140.1100000000001
on a good project that really made me

1137.47 --> 1150.07
work in a long time not even D&D because

1140.11 --> 1152.6699999999998
a stupid confid situation in half a year

1150.07 --> 1152.6699999999998
almost

1155.76 --> 1159.62
all right okay yeah you know what

1166.05 --> 1169.46
making another notes

1190.14 --> 1193.269
[Music]

1199.029 --> 1206.21
you know what I think this is a great

1202.159 --> 1208.3990000000001
idea guys there's a lot of ego

1206.21 --> 1209.99
resistance because I don't like changing

1208.399 --> 1215.779
even if it is for the better

1209.99 --> 1219.139
it's just a stupid slowness like yeah

1215.779 --> 1220.879
and and doesn't want to move you know he

1219.139 --> 1227.539
takes his time because that's how he

1220.879 --> 1229.039
likes it that's part of my problem but

1227.539 --> 1232.07
yeah I've been dealing with a lot of

1229.039 --> 1235.61
frustration and like feeling like [ __ ]

1232.07 --> 1238.73
I'm wasting my time like like yeah I do

1235.61 --> 1240.9189999999999
good things but it's like it feels like

1238.73 --> 1242.72
yeah I could do more but I couldn't

1240.919 --> 1248.99
figure out what this is actually a good

1242.72 --> 1251.779
entrance idea let's just see if I'm

1248.99 --> 1254.24
actually gonna do it or I'm gonna be all

1251.779 --> 1257.72
frustrated and then try to hide the idea

1254.24 --> 1260.99
for myself or something but I'm yeah

1257.72 --> 1264.1100000000001
it's a very good idea it involved

1260.99 --> 1270.47
directly what I've been doing here with

1264.11 --> 1274.2199999999998
my work for years now like I have an

1270.47 --> 1276.169
entrance point for even for a potential

1274.22 --> 1278.8990000000001
book because guys I have been thinking

1276.169 --> 1281.48
about writing a flat earth related books

1278.899 --> 1284.9899999999998
somehow in some way every time I think

1281.48 --> 1289.059
about it is every time like oh Jesus how

1284.99 --> 1294.519
do I even start like how do you start

1289.059 --> 1297.83
when you're trying to explain like

1294.519 --> 1300.999
something that is just so complex from

1297.83 --> 1304.039
so many angles in different ways even

1300.999 --> 1306.499
extremely seemingly contrasting how do

1304.039 --> 1310.519
you start a freaking story about so it's

1306.499 --> 1313.21
always like I don't know what to do but

1310.519 --> 1316.279
maybe just starting with basic

1313.21 --> 1318.169
presupposition of mechanics concerning

1316.279 --> 1322.61
cosmos and it would be an excellent

1318.169 --> 1324.6190000000001
entrance point already even making

1322.61 --> 1328.0
getting people training people that do

1324.619 --> 1331.78
look into that to realize like

1328.0 --> 1335.47
let's just call it quantum uncertainty

1331.78 --> 1341.33
like when you know so many things not

1335.47 --> 1343.04
how do you get a balanced fuel what is

1341.33 --> 1350.03
potentially out there it's very

1343.04 --> 1352.61
difficult like very difficult to stay

1350.03 --> 1354.44
real and not just start building your

1352.61 --> 1356.9299999999998
own storage because the proof is out of

1354.44 --> 1361.0900000000001
sight just like what is happening with

1356.93 --> 1361.0900000000001
cosmology see

1367.94 --> 1374.24
no I'm not gonna absolutely not gonna

1371.33 --> 1377.26
mirror some weirdo baller book and then

1374.24 --> 1380.03
reverse it no freakin way

1377.26 --> 1384.62
like most of the subjects that those

1380.03 --> 1386.84
people add like dead into it are a

1384.62 --> 1390.29
literal waste of time in the first place

1386.84 --> 1394.1299999999999
even rebutting to it in general so no my

1390.29 --> 1398.3899999999999
book is absolutely not even gonna have

1394.13 --> 1400.97
the concept of baller people in it it's

1398.39 --> 1402.8600000000001
not gonna do it about baller psychology

1400.97 --> 1405.43
if that's gonna be a thing that I'm

1402.86 --> 1408.32
gonna do and it wouldn't really want to

1405.43 --> 1411.38
that would be a separate book it's

1408.32 --> 1414.47
coming afterward maybe but no I'm gonna

1411.38 --> 1418.16
deal with cosmogony and that ballers you

1414.47 --> 1421.0
know you know how much input have

1418.16 --> 1427.4
ballers even had in my

1421.0 --> 1432.37
conceptualizations zero percent yeah

1427.4 --> 1435.38
zero percent not a single

1432.37 --> 1442.01
presuppositional add-on suggestion idea

1435.38 --> 1444.5300000000002
nothing not a single baller ever and not

1442.01 --> 1449.45
a lot of flat earthers either but at

1444.53 --> 1451.28
least they've tried to test the mechanic

1449.45 --> 1453.23
the presuppositional mechanics of it

1451.28 --> 1456.8
they even tried to feedbacks like oh

1453.23 --> 1461.66
like this like that okay okay you know

1456.8 --> 1468.02
that's at least something so yeah write

1461.66 --> 1471.1000000000001
a book titled the rumpus my god there's

1468.02 --> 1478.48
always enough terrible ideas isn't there

1471.1 --> 1482.59
ya know if anything I think maybe that's

1478.48 --> 1482.59
why would I write a book on

1483.37 --> 1494.0
and now we know now I think maybe that

1491.75 --> 1496.51
that would be more dance Persky

1494.0 --> 1496.51
mouseling

1510.61 --> 1517.09
but who knows maybe I will use the

1513.88 --> 1520.779
rhombus or things the rumpus has said or

1517.09 --> 1523.6899999999998
even ways he has spoken not so much

1520.779 --> 1525.94
focused on him but yeah because he is a

1523.69 --> 1529.779
good example of a lot of doublespeak and

1525.94 --> 1532.5700000000002
machinations so I might just use him as

1529.779 --> 1535.75
an example of like how certain cycle a

1532.57 --> 1538.029
psychological mechanisms may function

1535.75 --> 1540.429
and yeah talking about psychological

1538.029 --> 1543.73
mechanisms I think I could definitely

1540.429 --> 1547.179
fill up an entire psychology

1543.73 --> 1550.1390000000001
yeah psychology based philosophy based

1547.179 --> 1553.45
book concerning psychologists including

1550.139 --> 1559.9599999999998
yes systems that I figured out like

1553.45 --> 1564.3400000000001
physicality assumption bias psychology

1559.96 --> 1568.83
of the baller all right who knows

1564.34 --> 1568.83
dudes it's weird

1571.46 --> 1578.94
yeah thousand great ideas but there's

1575.28 --> 1584.61
only one person here pretty sure you're

1578.94 --> 1586.41
not gonna do it so yeah if you stack

1584.61 --> 1589.6499999999999
that all together you you're talking

1586.41 --> 1592.14
about years you know this [ __ ] is it

1589.65 --> 1602.49
just slap together in a in a in a couple

1592.14 --> 1606.99
of weeks so yeah enough about that I get

1602.49 --> 1610.32
it it's a good idea but if I'm gonna try

1606.99 --> 1612.54
to build some kind of presentation it's

1610.32 --> 1616.7
gonna be about yeah the presuppositional

1612.54 --> 1616.7
tree of possibilities for the realm

1627.71 --> 1636.82
all due respect I understand the work

1630.279 --> 1636.82
open Stanley who are you referring to

1657.38 --> 1660.13
yeah

1670.29 --> 1680.3999999999999
and you know what the weirdest part

1673.56 --> 1682.1399999999999
would be like if if we we or I I don't

1680.4 --> 1683.91
know maybe you could I don't know if I

1682.14 --> 1686.01
would do such a thing completely on my

1683.91 --> 1687.69
own I think other people would want to

1686.01 --> 1690.18
get involved I'm pretty sure that if I

1687.69 --> 1693.51
would writers make a serious psychology

1690.18 --> 1695.79
project that's first Kiva would probably

1693.51 --> 1699.36
want to get involved like he would want

1695.79 --> 1701.25
to try to and it would probably add on

1699.36 --> 1703.3799999999999
some some interesting information

1701.25 --> 1706.05
because he has done a lot of psychology

1703.38 --> 1708.2600000000002
focused fieldwork but this really is

1706.05 --> 1711.93
focused it's not a joke it's not an act

1708.26 --> 1713.07
these turns out to be pretty serious it

1711.93 --> 1720.6000000000001
pays a lot of attention

1713.07 --> 1724.83
so yeah such a project the funny thing

1720.6 --> 1728.4299999999998
is is that if we were to highlight like

1724.83 --> 1735.74
baller psychology right we could give

1728.43 --> 1740.9
examples with video and audio examples

1735.74 --> 1742.95
how it's basically a live field study

1740.9 --> 1746.0700000000002
potentially because we cut all this

1742.95 --> 1751.8500000000001
recording [ __ ] got so much it would be a

1746.07 --> 1751.85
lot of work but yeah

1753.86 --> 1762.6499999999999
like you could have like a a book with

1759.29 --> 1765.98
like a DVD with video examples and then

1762.65 --> 1770.6000000000001
in the book basically pointing to this

1765.98 --> 1772.49
file on the disk and that would be an

1770.6 --> 1775.4599999999998
easy way to not have a completely

1772.49 --> 1777.2
digitized version of it because

1775.46 --> 1779.33
otherwise it's just gonna be making any

1777.2 --> 1781.28
website that you have to pay for it to

1779.33 --> 1783.23
be able to see and then like have the

1781.28 --> 1788.8999999999999
videos next to the story but yeah that's

1783.23 --> 1791.24
I don't know that's an interesting stuff

1788.9 --> 1793.52
I had yeah it could be that now that I'm

1791.24 --> 1795.89
putting it down here right now that

1793.52 --> 1801.679
somebody else is going to completely

1795.89 --> 1803.51
hijack this concept so that might just

1801.679 --> 1806.27
be the end of it and then I'll just have

1803.51 --> 1810.83
the cosmati because nobody else can even

1806.27 --> 1813.62
freaking do it anyway so but yeah it is

1810.83 --> 1817.85
an amusing idea because we got all these

1813.62 --> 1820.25
recordings cut oh so much practical

1817.85 --> 1822.53
examples it's not just gonna bleed blah

1820.25 --> 1825.34
blah blah reference and that's

1822.53 --> 1825.34
fascinating

1840.269 --> 1845.919
and I'm sure that follow I'm sure I

1844.33 --> 1847.899
don't know there might be some freaking

1845.919 --> 1850.659
ballers that would try to make some kind

1847.899 --> 1854.799
of ridiculous mock version of such a

1850.659 --> 1857.3500000000001
thing about flat earthers as well just

1854.799 --> 1860.049
highlight how loud we are and then just

1857.35 --> 1861.759
constantly red herring that [ __ ] out

1860.049 --> 1864.9089999999999
like a complete letter they could

1861.759 --> 1871.3600000000001
Gaslight an entire book about us I'll

1864.909 --> 1875.0390000000002
bet they want it they'll sink deep

1871.36 --> 1875.039
enough to do that [ __ ] eventually

1895.26 --> 1903.53
okay Robin Stanley what kind of project

1899.6 --> 1907.82
no Morris creatives and technical people

1903.53 --> 1907.82
what kind of project is that

1919.94 --> 1924.56
now Robin standard but that's not what I

1922.34 --> 1929.27
mean and look I'm not talking about

1924.56 --> 1931.6399999999999
corporate copycat [ __ ] I don't give

1929.27 --> 1934.12
a [ __ ] about that because it's all

1931.64 --> 1937.0700000000002
hollow it doesn't mean anything it's

1934.12 --> 1941.6899999999998
filler that [ __ ] and I'm talking about

1937.07 --> 1945.11
other people within flat earth taking my

1941.69 --> 1947.69
idea and then like yeah not having the

1945.11 --> 1949.37
typical are we need obstacle to get over

1947.69 --> 1953.24
and actually do something new and

1949.37 --> 1958.06
they're just they might just do it so

1953.24 --> 1958.06
yeah story of my life

1971.45 --> 1975.82
oh yeah great Missouri bear yeah

1974.72 --> 1979.6100000000001
brilliant

1975.82 --> 1981.35
brilliance shout it out yeah they're so

1979.61 --> 1984.9199999999998
great it'll make millions

1981.35 --> 1990.11
that'll not get even more people to

1984.92 --> 1991.6100000000001
quickly grab a little this brilliant you

1990.11 --> 1998.86
always think about these things so

1991.61 --> 1998.86
carefully yeah money

2006.72 --> 2009.869
[Music]

2013.83 --> 2020.6689999999999
like money is [ __ ] if somebody tells me

2018.809 --> 2023.76
oh you could get millions that means I

2020.669 --> 2027.179
run away in the other direction as quick

2023.76 --> 2029.06
as I can literally that is what that

2027.179 --> 2032.19
means to me

2029.06 --> 2032.19
[Music]

2050.56 --> 2059.45
but hey if I happen to make a lot of

2055.46 --> 2063.11
money in the process eventually you know

2059.45 --> 2067.3399999999997
and not part as these start out intro or

2063.11 --> 2073.67
the allure or some freaking deal that

2067.34 --> 2076.1000000000004
will be great not doing like I'm not

2073.67 --> 2078.5
gonna do it like that ever

2076.1 --> 2080.27
I'm gonna do it because I want to do it

2078.5 --> 2083.66
and because I think I can do it and

2080.27 --> 2086.9
because I think I need to do it and then

2083.66 --> 2088.73
if I get all showered with money for

2086.9 --> 2093.28
whatever reason afterward that would be

2088.73 --> 2093.28
awesome but that's just a bonus

2104.68 --> 2111.64
mmm-hmm you're gonna get a timeout for

2107.96 --> 2111.64
that that's just [ __ ] dumb

2117.21 --> 2120.34
[Music]

2127.71 --> 2135.3
why so serious because I'm talking about

2131.05 --> 2142.9
freaking Dedic life dedications here a

2135.3 --> 2145.54
big project it's very serious to me this

2142.9 --> 2148.5
is not just oh I'm bored for the day

2145.54 --> 2151.41
what am I gonna goof ball around with no

2148.5 --> 2154.06
it's a serious [ __ ]

2151.41 --> 2157.98
writing a book is they take it extremely

2154.06 --> 2157.98
serious that's why I have never done it

2173.83 --> 2180.58
like I've written down ideas but then I

2176.38 --> 2183.7000000000003
was thinking like I don't know man maybe

2180.58 --> 2187.0
I'm just this freakin writer's curse

2183.7 --> 2190.56
that sometimes if I got an idea I'm just

2187.0 --> 2194.47
afraid of what it would do to the world

2190.56 --> 2196.84
serious and this is even an interactive

2194.47 --> 2199.72
thing with me ideas that sometimes come

2196.84 --> 2202.63
to my mind I'm like yeah that is like

2199.72 --> 2205.99
that is freaking amazing but it's like

2202.63 --> 2207.46
dangerous so if I just say it just like

2205.99 --> 2211.54
that put it down like that and be like

2207.46 --> 2216.33
oh yeah that's actually gonna have a

2211.54 --> 2221.95
negative shock effect that is gonna

2216.33 --> 2225.69
resonate on into the future and I'm

2221.95 --> 2225.6899999999996
constantly afraid of that [ __ ]

2225.72 --> 2232.24
well not constantly that's that's

2228.4 --> 2237.31
ridiculous it's just that in the past I

2232.24 --> 2239.56
was at times so dissatisfied that the

2237.31 --> 2242.2
ideas that came out of me or even

2239.56 --> 2245.11
rejected at times and then at some point

2242.2 --> 2246.97
I thought like yeah I'm gonna just throw

2245.11 --> 2249.58
it out there nobody's gonna hold me back

2246.97 --> 2254.52
anymore then I did that a period and

2249.58 --> 2257.62
then I [ __ ] up everything so bad on

2254.52 --> 2262.5099999999998
yeah uncomplicated level I don't even

2257.62 --> 2265.42
want to get into that just creating

2262.51 --> 2270.1000000000004
delusions in the process to myself that

2265.42 --> 2271.9
I just looked i frickin learned my

2270.1 --> 2275.95
lesson about delusion and the

2271.9 --> 2278.4700000000003
consequences more than anyone that I've

2275.95 --> 2281.58
ever met

2278.47 --> 2281.58
[Music]

2292.529 --> 2299.249
and that's on a personal level because

2295.42 --> 2303.309
the societal consequences are negligible

2299.249 --> 2308.4689999999996
I'm just regarded as like like a weirdo

2303.309 --> 2316.029
that yeah doesn't really fit in but is

2308.469 --> 2318.64
okay but yeah on a personal level on my

2316.029 --> 2322.989
inner world on my own psyche on my own

2318.64 --> 2326.6189999999997
feeling world the consequences of just

2322.989 --> 2329.7690000000002
saying yeah [ __ ] everything I'm just

2326.619 --> 2333.67
going to say whatever freaking comes to

2329.769 --> 2337.39
mind no matter the insanity or the

2333.67 --> 2339.549
darkness or the mania I'm just gonna

2337.39 --> 2342.16
throw it out there yeah I've learned my

2339.549 --> 2346.319
freakin lesson okay and if you think

2342.16 --> 2350.859
that 82 that thing that that looks bad

2346.319 --> 2353.14
well that's that's just cookies compared

2350.859 --> 2357.16
to the [ __ ] that has come out of me not

2353.14 --> 2359.259
on camera thank God in the past and I'm

2357.16 --> 2361.209
not talking about aggression level oh it

2359.259 --> 2363.449
was worse no I'm talking about just

2361.209 --> 2368.6789999999996
being out of your mind

2363.449 --> 2370.989
frustrated or just extreme mania about

2368.679 --> 2373.779
things including things that don't

2370.989 --> 2375.549
matter but it had to matter to me

2373.779 --> 2378.489
because I was holding on to some weird

2375.549 --> 2381.839
pattern in my head of how things must be

2378.489 --> 2381.839
and that kind of [ __ ]

2382.589 --> 2387.7889999999998
yeah and that was by the way during that

2385.779 --> 2391.469
entire period I was a baller

2387.789 --> 2396.5190000000002
just for the record was a very fanatical

2391.469 --> 2399.119
doubling downing baller yeah just to

2396.519 --> 2399.1189999999997
clear that up

2400.09 --> 2403.4790000000003
[Music]

2407.3 --> 2411.159
[Music]

2418.06 --> 2422.31
okay I had to get that off my chest oh

2429.48 --> 2437.11
yeah I'm sure yeah if only if only I

2433.78 --> 2441.13
just believed in the ball right leaping

2437.11 --> 2443.92
for J then suddenly it would be

2441.13 --> 2446.92
politically allowed for you to switch

2443.92 --> 2449.7400000000002
that clock under at an 80 degrees click

2446.92 --> 2451.9300000000003
oh now he's brilliant because now he

2449.74 --> 2455.9199999999996
believes in the book if I was a freakin

2451.93 --> 2459.2799999999997
baller right if I was officially a

2455.92 --> 2461.7400000000002
baller this whole time from the start

2459.28 --> 2463.42
and saying no come on come on guys I'm

2461.74 --> 2466.24
not like the rumpus I'm not like George

2463.42 --> 2468.52
I'm just a baller but I'm really into

2466.24 --> 2471.1299999999997
this flat earth Cosmo Jeannie and I want

2468.52 --> 2474.1
to figure out like mechanically what it

2471.13 --> 2476.76
could be in there right you [ __ ]

2474.1 --> 2480.2999999999997
people would [ __ ] worship me [ __ ]

2476.76 --> 2484.42
you would wouldn't you but you can't

2480.3 --> 2488.26
because I'm a flat earther so you got to

2484.42 --> 2491.38
switch it 180 degrees but no if I did it

2488.26 --> 2495.55
from the other side the same thing you

2491.38 --> 2498.79
would [ __ ] worship you would because

2495.55 --> 2502.2400000000002
you're religious fanatic idiots and you

2498.79 --> 2505.66
don't even know it you don't even know

2502.24 --> 2507.91
it it's so ingrained in your feelings

2505.66 --> 2509.56
that your ration your rationality

2507.91 --> 2514.24
doesn't even have anything to do with it

2509.56 --> 2516.88
no your rationality is a side tool for

2514.24 --> 2520.39
your religious feeling experience in

2516.88 --> 2523.51
order to protect that religious feeling

2520.39 --> 2526.33
experience and that's the only thing

2523.51 --> 2531.7000000000003
that really matters in the end so you

2526.33 --> 2533.98
call me stupid if I'd say I was a baller

2531.7 --> 2536.7999999999997
and I did exactly the same things that

2533.98 --> 2539.43
I've done you'd [ __ ] worship me and

2536.8 --> 2539.4300000000003
you know it

2549.33 --> 2552.469
[Music]

2558.1 --> 2567.0699999999997
no I'm saying you would find me amazing

2563.52 --> 2571.11
you would all be trusting on Arwen to

2567.07 --> 2575.0800000000004
save the ball even though technically

2571.11 --> 2580.7200000000003
that's kind of what I'm doing now from a

2575.08 --> 2584.3199999999997
[ __ ] Flat Earth side no no you can't

2580.72 --> 2586.8599999999997
handle it because you're a religious

2584.32 --> 2586.86
freak

2602.98 --> 2608.96
[Music]

2605.41 --> 2613.1
ballers you know baller religious people

2608.96 --> 2617.42
they're not even worthy of the concept

2613.1 --> 2625.66
of a ball cosmology they're not even

2617.42 --> 2630.53
worthy of the tool they're too

2625.66 --> 2635.39
personally they arranged and vapid and

2630.53 --> 2638.96
void and useless senseless to even

2635.39 --> 2649.5499999999997
actually wield their own [ __ ]

2638.96 --> 2651.89
religion they got this amazing construct

2649.55 --> 2654.55
and they're not even [ __ ] worthy of

2651.89 --> 2659.54
wielding it because they're pathetic

2654.55 --> 2663.2000000000003
goblins and then it's just [ __ ]

2659.54 --> 2665.0
around with it playing football thinking

2663.2 --> 2667.81
they're the best in the world like a

2665.0 --> 2667.81
bunch of retards

2679.94 --> 2684.66
not saying that if you like football

2682.44 --> 2689.849
playing that you're [ __ ] but it was

2684.66 --> 2693.049
metaphorical you know football's a great

2689.849 --> 2693.049
game to play

2700.49 --> 2705.4399999999996
yeah I'm getting all riled up today am I

2703.26 --> 2705.44
not

2713.21 --> 2718.94
yeah and so far the show has absolutely

2715.809 --> 2722.6600000000003
nothing to do with Marxist politicians

2718.94 --> 2727.88
nor statues so I might change up the

2722.66 --> 2731.72
title but yeah I've been seeing that

2727.88 --> 2734.1800000000003
[ __ ] happening - Alex challenges

2731.72 --> 2737.3489999999997
constantly like terrorists one statue

2734.18 --> 2742.79
after it's like statue toppling day in

2737.349 --> 2745.52
the via via videography Department over

2742.79 --> 2750.19
at Infowars it's like freaking statues

2745.52 --> 2755.99
dropping everywhere and it pisses me off

2750.19 --> 2758.4500000000003
but it's weird it's almost like yeah

2755.99 --> 2760.7
this is completely useless and like it

2758.45 --> 2763.8799999999997
doesn't even mean anything it's just

2760.7 --> 2767.5099999999998
hurting people's feelings that's it

2763.88 --> 2770.119
because the statues like yeah after that

2767.51 --> 2771.98
[ __ ] is over it could only be replaced

2770.119 --> 2774.77
repaired put back like nothing ever

2771.98 --> 2779.26
happened so technically it's not even

2774.77 --> 2782.17
that bad but it's just so it's just pure

2779.26 --> 2786.26
agitation of people that actually care

2782.17 --> 2788.569
like even though some of it may be weird

2786.26 --> 2790.28
historical manipulation and all that

2788.569 --> 2795.109
[ __ ] it doesn't matter because it's

2790.28 --> 2797.809
still it's yeah so that's kind of

2795.109 --> 2801.74
pissing me off as well that may be part

2797.809 --> 2803.27
of why I got a little fired up here even

2801.74 --> 2807.3089999999997
though it has nothing to do with Flat

2803.27 --> 2807.309
Earth or the globe directly

2816.84 --> 2822.42
yeah yeah move your moaning lazy [ __ ]

2819.93 --> 2824.5499999999997

Drury hidden didn't hobo is he's still

2871.68 --> 2877.64
here

2872.93 --> 2877.64
hope you can follow what I'm saying

2886.72 --> 2898.39
oh I think we got a I think we got us a

2892.57 --> 2901.06
troll spree I think somebody got

2898.39 --> 2907.17
triggered i think somebody like really

2901.06 --> 2917.0499999999997
got shown exactly what they are loudly

2907.17 --> 2927.73
with great ferocity and hatred yeah and

2917.05 --> 2929.77
I didn't like it yeah just keep your

2927.73 --> 2932.109
Spears ready and yeah

2929.77 --> 2934.71
Oh keep the gates open let's see what

2932.109 --> 2934.71
comes through

2951.2 --> 2955.0
on board for public art

2957.93 --> 2967.3199999999997
yeah well Robin Stanley you know public

2960.78 --> 2970.9500000000003
art yeah you know art in public is a

2967.32 --> 2975.3300000000004
pretty new weird concept in the first

2970.95 --> 2977.25
place you know it like there are so many

2975.33 --> 2979.58
possibilities and but like what is the

2977.25 --> 2985.32
influence is what is it justified like

2979.58 --> 2988.11
so much and yeah it can be probably when

2985.32 --> 2991.2000000000003
it's not just statues there's like

2988.11 --> 2993.6
modern art stuff in Netherlands all over

2991.2 --> 2995.46
but they just put some modern art thing

2993.6 --> 3001.64
somewhere and it's repulsive

2995.46 --> 3005.45
well that's sort of public art by some

3001.64 --> 3008.45
artists but it's just the wellses

3005.45 --> 3010.58
sometimes you know sometimes it's

3008.45 --> 3013.1299999999997
halfway interesting but it's still like

3010.58 --> 3017.39
I don't think that modern art should be

3013.13 --> 3019.46
public part of public display I think

3017.39 --> 3022.91
that should be reserved for special art

3019.46 --> 3025.04
galleries and such or special places and

3022.91 --> 3028.8399999999997
not just part of the normal scenery

3025.04 --> 3028.84
that's my opinion

3038.47 --> 3044.95
what science has been abolished are you

3042.25 --> 3049.27
talking about it's not been abolished

3044.95 --> 3051.0899999999997
it's been abandoned still there they

3049.27 --> 3054.13
just don't use it anymore it's the

3051.09 --> 3058.0
old-fashioned science right where you

3054.13 --> 3064.21
actually have to manipulate a very the

3058.0 --> 3065.68
independent variable oh hey

3064.21 --> 3068.52

3229.72 --> 3238.47

3298.109 --> 3307.109
much yeah it's not literal I know it's a

3304.619 --> 3311.04
saying I just find it a very odd saying

3307.109 --> 3315.72
but then again it is a saying that comes

3311.04 --> 3318.54
forth from like the from farmer culture

3315.72 --> 3320.9399999999996
because like every egg is different and

3318.54 --> 3323.88
then yeah you got oh you got the good

3320.94 --> 3325.589
acts and sometimes there's a bad act so

3323.88 --> 3328.32
to say somebody's a good egg is like oh

3325.589 --> 3330.69
yeah among the others you're good and

of a guy's head he has to put it down on

3433.75 --> 3440.02
everybody will want to do try to top

3437.2 --> 3443.5899999999997
that but it's very difficult because

3440.02 --> 3446.62
everything is already so great but then

3443.59 --> 3450.6400000000003
they figured out wait if you make things

3446.62 --> 3453.6099999999997
ugly or agitate then ill also bring

3450.64 --> 3456.8799999999997
things in motion people will start to

3453.61 --> 3459.4300000000003
put energy encountering it and therefore

3456.88 --> 3462.04
thing more things happen more economy

3459.43 --> 3466.8599999999997
this is really the formula guys that's

3462.04 --> 3469.66
it and that thing completely counteracts

3466.86 --> 3471.79
the old-fashioned mechanism of just

3469.66 --> 3473.17
trying to keep everything great so that

3471.79 --> 3477.94
whatever people are going to come up

3473.17 --> 3479.9500000000003
with this like great and everybody's at

3477.94 --> 3482.62
peace but now this mechanism is

3479.95 --> 3488.83
introduced has been for a while and

3482.62 --> 3493.06
suddenly yeah more ugly things more

3488.83 --> 3495.81
things said that nobody wants in in

3493.06 --> 3500.7999999999997
places that everybody hears and all that

3495.81 --> 3503.58
just agitation it's like the agro

3500.8 --> 3503.5800000000004
economy

3515.02 --> 3518.5
all right well leap in for J I do my

3518.11 --> 3525.6400000000003
best

3518.5 --> 3530.74
I I it does feel like at least a worthy

3525.64 --> 3532.45
enough purpose for me to do this but

3530.74 --> 3534.64
yeah at the same time I'm still the

3532.45 --> 3538.4199999999996
diamond Explorer you know I didn't write

3534.64 --> 3540.1
the book literally like the book is not

3538.42 --> 3542.4700000000003
already written and I'm just reading

3540.1 --> 3547.0299999999997
from it like like a teaching program no

3542.47 --> 3551.4599999999996
I am building as I go and I hope I keep

3547.03 --> 3551.46
building kind of in front of the rest

3551.94 --> 3558.369
the yeah like build I guess you could

3555.91 --> 3564.99
call it a scout scout into the other

3558.369 --> 3564.9900000000002
dimension cleaner Walker

3577.97 --> 3580.75
hmm

3582.42 --> 3585.539
[Music]

3592.03 --> 3594.8100000000004
all right

3595.51 --> 3599.53
yeah and another thing I don't know yeah

3598.03 --> 3601.78
it's gonna be five four minutes but

3599.53 --> 3603.369
maybe a little personal thing I don't

3601.78 --> 3604.96
know it is kind of a downer maybe

3603.369 --> 3606.8500000000004
compared to everything before here but

3604.96 --> 3609.82
something that I've been dealing with

3606.85 --> 3613.0
and yeah a lifelong issue but now that I

3609.82 --> 3615.67
have like this did this show colleagues

3613.0 --> 3621.369
for Flat Earth debate says I got it I

3615.67 --> 3624.04
got a a group basically the side that

3621.369 --> 3627.25
I'm working on now the problem is is

3624.04 --> 3630.34
this internet thing is still very disc

3627.25 --> 3634.57
on tarted it's very separate from my

3630.34 --> 3637.84
physical daily life it is completely

3634.57 --> 3640.2400000000002
separate effectively I don't have any

3637.84 --> 3643.75
people that I know here like not a

3640.24 --> 3647.35
singular one that I can just go over and

3643.75 --> 3650.65
talk about it not really like there are

3647.35 --> 3653.08
people open-minded enough to not like

3650.65 --> 3654.4300000000003
attack you if you bring up oh yeah I'm a

3653.08 --> 3660.49
flat earther or something you know

3654.43 --> 3662.95
that's that's going down but I don't

3660.49 --> 3665.2299999999996
really have the same thing as I have

3662.95 --> 3667.48
over the internet with people and this

3665.23 --> 3669.67
is also for me very concerning because

3667.48 --> 3673.21
yeah how am I gonna find a freaking life

3669.67 --> 3675.19
like that though so just go start random

3673.21 --> 3678.07
dating in and hope that at the hundreth

3675.19 --> 3682.21
woman or something it might work or that

3678.07 --> 3687.369
did that sounds pessimistic but like I

3682.21 --> 3690.609
just want to somehow reconnect again but

3687.369 --> 3692.6400000000003
the physical world here and not just the

3690.609 --> 3695.95
internet because the Internet is

3692.64 --> 3701.52
providing me purpose giving me room to

3695.95 --> 3705.3399999999997
grow where I actually feel that I matter

3701.52 --> 3708.22
but for my own life it kind of keeps me

3705.34 --> 3711.46
isolated effective because my social

3708.22 --> 3714.2799999999997
systems here in the Netherlands around

3711.46 --> 3716.8
me it's not really developing it really

3714.28 --> 3719.8
isn't and it's kind of worrying me it's

3716.8 --> 3726.3100000000004
not really a towering problem right now

3719.8 --> 3728.8590000000004
but just the the non change is kind of

3726.31 --> 3730.66
an Irving me because if I lose track

3728.859 --> 3732.5789999999997
of it too much and just shove it to the

3730.66 --> 3735.0989999999997
side and only focus on the internet yeah

3732.579 --> 3736.96
I could be great over there eventually

3735.099 --> 3738.94
like it can imagine like after two years

3736.96 --> 3741.67
or something like yeah might be very

3738.94 --> 3745.779
widely known not and then in this world

3741.67 --> 3748.39
I'd still be this freaking weirdo that

3745.779 --> 3750.91
literally doesn't forgot how to

3748.39 --> 3754.509
communicate face-to-face or something

3750.91 --> 3762.069
not literally but just doesn't know how

3754.509 --> 3765.91
to compose themselves physically anymore

3762.069 --> 3767.829
towards other people face-to-face and

3765.91 --> 3771.64
that is kind of an it's always been an

3767.829 --> 3776.259
issue with me but it is a growing

3771.64 --> 3780.97
concern I want to be able to learn how

3776.259 --> 3790.96
people are in groups and why that works

3780.97 --> 3793.93
and ah find out if it could at any point

3790.96 --> 3795.579
in my life still be for me in some way

3793.93 --> 3798.22
because you kinda do need that in a

3795.579 --> 3806.739
family set up you do need to be able to

3798.22 --> 3808.9599999999996
be with people constantly and yeah if I

3806.739 --> 3813.309
don't do that I might end up just like

3808.96 --> 3815.95
that weirdo shaman that's somewhere in a

3813.309 --> 3818.2000000000003
in a hut in the middle of the forest

3815.95 --> 3822.16
away from everybody who's like really

3818.2 --> 3825.249
nice but crazy and freaking lonely and

3822.16 --> 3827.95
that's not a view of myself in the

3825.249 --> 3832.499
future that I kind of want to go towards

3827.95 --> 3832.499
if you know what I mean yeah

3837.94 --> 3843.16
why would you say you are the same now

3840.4 --> 3846.4
but tiny wumbo it's because the attitude

3843.16 --> 3848.859
with the people here there are different

3846.4 --> 3853.42
people they've already engaged in a

3848.859 --> 3856.8289999999997
history with things development a lore I

3853.42 --> 3860.289
got so much to grab onto out there

3856.829 --> 3862.6600000000003
there's none of that not a single thing

3860.289 --> 3865.75
that I can grab onto that I'd be like oh

3862.66 --> 3872.5
yeah yeah I can talk about that no cuz

3865.75 --> 3874.39
it's all [ __ ] all of it everything the

3872.5 --> 3878.559
only thing I hear people talk about is

3874.39 --> 3881.3489999999997
[ __ ] or just like dude their sport

3878.559 --> 3882.52
or their hobby or their work and it's oh

3881.349 --> 3889.059
good

3882.52 --> 3891.309
nobody talks about anything just or they

3889.059 --> 3893.65
go online and get all trolli and [ __ ]

3891.309 --> 3896.3190000000004
that's I think that in the Netherlands

3893.65 --> 3900.76
that is especially a thing that a lot of

3896.319 --> 3902.71
people like if their social life and

3900.76 --> 3904.4500000000003
then there have the internet life and

3902.71 --> 3905.799
they go all troll berserk there

3904.45 --> 3908.9199999999996
sometimes and then they have to

3905.799 --> 3912.069
backtrack or like try to do it

3908.92 --> 3915.789
anonymously or blah blah blah right I

3912.069 --> 3918.069
don't know how to connect with this and

3915.789 --> 3922.98
there's a couple of people that are

3918.069 --> 3922.98
really awesome and I have talked with

3924.48 --> 3935.89
yeah his name the Indonesian guy like I

3933.16 --> 3938.77
met him like twice and even but he moved

3935.89 --> 3941.23
away to the east of the country he's an

3938.77 --> 3943.93
absolutely great guy to be with and I

3941.23 --> 3946.539
feel really kind of like ya can

3943.93 --> 3953.609
communicate with that but there's not

3946.539 --> 3953.6090000000004
like an entire group of this

3955.65 --> 3961.96
you know it's very sporadic most people

3959.83 --> 3964.27
are just preoccupied with completely

3961.96 --> 3966.91
different things and oh caught up in

3964.27 --> 3971.82
societal things or pecking order issues

3966.91 --> 3975.8399999999997
or whatever or just their own little

3971.82 --> 3975.84
superficial dream

3982.54 --> 3988.0299999999997
I don't know maybe yeah anyway that's

3985.78 --> 3989.8900000000003
like yeah it's another citation sorry

3988.03 --> 3992.8
that sounds like a bummer compared to

3989.89 --> 3995.52
everything else but it is kind of an

3992.8 --> 3999.9
issue that I yeah it frustrates me

3995.52 --> 4002.82
because I have I feel I got group

3999.9 --> 4007.77
potential and I kind of like wanna

4002.82 --> 4012.27
utilize it somehow and just finally get

4007.77 --> 4017.0099999999998
that grip on the physical world that I

4012.27 --> 4018.42
have been looking for for so long anyway

4017.01 --> 4020.4900000000002
