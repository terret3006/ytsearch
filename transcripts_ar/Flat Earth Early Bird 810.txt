92.159 --> 94.4
so

96.32 --> 103.83999999999999
whether today against

101.36 --> 104.56
just kind of nice and warm actually

103.84 --> 107.52000000000001
outside

104.56 --> 107.52
it's a bit cloudy

110.64 --> 113.6
there's a bit of wind

113.68 --> 118.32000000000001
but it's yeah it's it's not a cold wind

116.799 --> 122.64
so

118.32 --> 125.91999999999999
besides doors

122.64 --> 126.399
uh like shattering and all that from the

125.92 --> 129.44
wind

126.399 --> 131.12
how do you call that blown open and

129.44 --> 134.48
closed

131.12 --> 137.04
yeah there's not a really a lot to

134.48 --> 140.23899999999998
feel that wind by because it's just

137.04 --> 140.239
really nice temperature

140.84 --> 143.84
air

144.48 --> 149.06
right

145.92 --> 149.05999999999997
[Music]

154.959 --> 162.31900000000002
i wonder too like if the

158.08 --> 162.31900000000002
if the sunlight has changed now

162.72 --> 166.8
there hasn't been a really clear day

165.599 --> 169.599
since

166.8 --> 171.04000000000002
the snow melted well it's just been like

169.599 --> 173.76
two days so

171.04 --> 173.76
two three

174.4 --> 180.48000000000002
but i remember from the snow just how

177.28 --> 183.12
blinding the light was

180.48 --> 185.04
and now i'm in my memory i anchored that

183.12 --> 187.59900000000002
down and i kind of want to compare it

185.04 --> 191.44
like what is the sunlight now like maybe

187.599 --> 191.44
the sunlight in itself changed

191.599 --> 194.72
maybe it has to do with the atmospheres

194.319 --> 199.83999999999997
the

194.72 --> 199.84
the light is shining through

200.879 --> 212.07999999999998
from wherever it's coming

203.92 --> 213.76
the non-location

212.08 --> 216.15900000000002
when does spring come in well spring

213.76 --> 227.84
comes in during march so it should be

216.159 --> 227.84
another month

231.04 --> 236.64
but hey wait

234.08 --> 237.43900000000002
something's coming through a little yeah

236.64 --> 241.83999999999997
but still

237.439 --> 241.84
kind of hazy up there

242.879 --> 249.51899999999998
but yeah it is it it does still

246.159 --> 253.439
seem to be the typical winter sunlight

249.519 --> 258.2
yeah right

253.439 --> 261.199
took a quick look and it does

258.2 --> 265.52
[Music]

261.199 --> 265.52000000000004
all right so hello tom parker first in

266.84 --> 271.65999999999997
chat

268.55 --> 271.66
[Music]

280.84 --> 285.919
so

283.04 --> 288.40000000000003
so did all of you enjoy my spheres have

285.919 --> 288.4
edges

288.479 --> 294.96
well rant pretty much yesterday

291.759 --> 298.0
turned into a big rant

294.96 --> 301.19899999999996
i watched it all back and i

298.0 --> 311.84
really had a big laugh i i

301.199 --> 311.84000000000003
laughed so hard watching that back

315.52 --> 320.08
because it was so simple it was such a

317.759 --> 323.199
simplistic thing

320.08 --> 327.68
that that was the message just something

323.199 --> 327.68
really basic so a rudimentary and

328.0 --> 332.4
yeah there were just people that just

329.44 --> 332.4
couldn't handle it

336.0 --> 339.6
and also i've been thinking a little

337.68 --> 340.40000000000003
about the language thing and i never got

339.6 --> 342.88
to asking

340.4 --> 342.88
about it

343.759 --> 346.96000000000004
because the flat earth debate was kind

345.6 --> 348.47900000000004
of like

346.96 --> 350.84
people had their own things on their

348.479 --> 354.08
mind and

350.84 --> 357.75899999999996
uh but like

354.08 --> 357.75899999999996
spheres have edges

359.759 --> 366.0
like i wonder back now if like

362.96 --> 367.039
if that is actually really the proper

366.0 --> 369.68
way to say it or

367.039 --> 370.08
if you would have to say spheres have an

369.68 --> 373.36
edge

370.08 --> 373.35999999999996
because that would also

379.68 --> 385.759
i work know but yeah

382.88 --> 386.24
my technical ex my justification reason

385.759 --> 389.44
for

386.24 --> 392.96000000000004
why i called it that way i think it was

389.44 --> 395.199
correct so maybe it's not

392.96 --> 396.31899999999996
the most eloquent looking english

395.199 --> 399.36
perhaps

396.319 --> 402.88
not too sure maybe that's the maybe the

399.36 --> 405.68
the objection is static rather than

402.88 --> 405.68
grammatical

407.28 --> 422.55999999999995
but it is correct anyway

411.28 --> 437.84
hey mellow fellow good afternoon

422.56 --> 437.84
got green tea here it's still hot

441.52 --> 446.96
so generally in the field out there

444.8 --> 448.96000000000004
yeah flat earth debate i kind of did the

446.96 --> 452.23999999999995
same routine as i did

448.96 --> 452.23999999999995
in on tuesday

452.72 --> 458.88000000000005
not super active

455.84 --> 460.15999999999997
although i did manage to catch the tale

458.88 --> 462.24
of the after show

460.16 --> 464.16
when i got back like it's like when i

462.24 --> 466.56
logged on was ready to get

464.16 --> 467.199
speak up that's when nathan started

466.56 --> 471.36
rounding

467.199 --> 471.36
out so just got the tail end of it

474.56 --> 481.44
also texas with all this

478.16 --> 485.12
the weather issue like infowars now is

481.44 --> 485.12
or mostly alex himself

485.28 --> 490.84
i guess the rest is all stuck in traffic

488.72 --> 493.68
or something

490.84 --> 496.79999999999995
but uh alex and also

493.68 --> 498.24
uh owen schroeder i saw both of them in

496.8 --> 500.24
the studio

498.24 --> 502.879
like with no monitors on so they got

500.24 --> 507.84000000000003
some emergency power going

502.879 --> 507.84000000000003
this blackout situation

508.72 --> 512.9590000000001
and yet they're suggesting that enron is

511.84 --> 515.5989999999999
behind it again

512.959 --> 518.8
and it's like basically bringing out old

515.599 --> 518.8000000000001
tricks out of the closet

519.2 --> 523.12
it it was an interesting way of thinking

521.919 --> 526.399
about it i wonder if

523.12 --> 529.92
that if they're right it's

526.399 --> 535.44
extremely scandalous

529.92 --> 537.8389999999999
but anyway what some of that

535.44 --> 540.399
and yeah this morning right before the

537.839 --> 546.0
show i was watching owen benjamin

540.399 --> 546.0
i had another well upload on bit shoot

547.839 --> 553.12
didn't watch all of it

550.88 --> 554.8
didn't get to it i know it is too late i

553.12 --> 559.92
started watching today

554.8 --> 563.8389999999999
but it was it was pretty good uh

559.92 --> 563.8389999999999
from what i did see

572.45 --> 575.489
[Music]

588.839 --> 591.839
hmm

598.24 --> 606.399
okay so is anybody else

602.88 --> 608.56
out there i'm i've basically

606.399 --> 610.399
need to say less basically that's the

608.56 --> 611.5189999999999
one problem you know listening back oh

610.399 --> 615.279
my god

611.519 --> 617.6
i have stop words routine words

615.279 --> 620.399
that are not good they have somehow

617.6 --> 620.399
slipped in with

621.76 --> 624.88
with my mood i guess

626.959 --> 634.399
i've but i had managed to keep them out

630.959 --> 634.399
for a very long time though

636.079 --> 639.3599999999999
has a reason been given by so many

638.079 --> 643.12
without power

639.36 --> 647.839
well this is what i got out of it so far

643.12 --> 647.839
george sanford what they said is that

648.16 --> 652.0
power is effectively just being turned

650.24 --> 656.32
off

652.0 --> 659.12
and potentially allegedly

656.32 --> 660.32
the windmills being frozen up because of

659.12 --> 662.88
the weather

660.32 --> 663.9200000000001
might actually not actually not be real

662.88 --> 670.399
it might just be an

663.92 --> 670.399
excuse because they're not really frozen

672.16 --> 675.1999999999999
but even if they were then there should

674.56 --> 678.16
be a

675.2 --> 678.1600000000001
backup system

681.279 --> 686.32
and they just haven't turned it on so it

684.16 --> 691.68
seems

686.32 --> 691.6800000000001
so whatever is going on it's at minimum

692.0 --> 694.88
or yeah

696.8 --> 703.68
at best it's gross negligence and

700.839 --> 708.48
incompetence running

703.68 --> 710.7199999999999
or having responsibility the power

708.48 --> 711.839
you know with all the consequences and

710.72 --> 716.72
at worst it is

711.839 --> 720.32
like a willful

716.72 --> 720.9590000000001
manipulation and lying and just turning

720.32 --> 724.399
it off

720.959 --> 724.399
for other motivations

724.88 --> 731.2
right whatever those might be

728.56 --> 731.8389999999999
whether it's like eugenics even to that

731.2 --> 734.88
bad

731.839 --> 739.36
to that level or it's like

734.88 --> 739.68
some weird environmental fanaticism with

739.36 --> 743.12
the

739.68 --> 745.1999999999999
co2 obsession and all that either way

743.12 --> 746.88
or or maybe another reason i think it's

745.2 --> 750.5600000000001
probably eugenics or just

746.88 --> 750.56
straight out political attack

753.04 --> 759.76
because texas is after all like

756.72 --> 763.2
pretty rebellious against the

759.76 --> 763.2
communist invasion

763.44 --> 772.639
like and texas has put potential to

768.0 --> 775.76
to become easily become a separate state

772.639 --> 779.04
that's always like on the line

775.76 --> 780.8
when america comes on the tension so

779.04 --> 782.8
that might be the rate might just be

780.8 --> 786.56
political once again

782.8 --> 790.24
so but it it's a bad situation

786.56 --> 790.2399999999999
so that is what i got out of it

799.519 --> 815.839
okay perseverance is

803.36 --> 815.839
landing on mars oh sure

831.76 --> 838.959
devon island is that the location they

836.56 --> 839.5999999999999
they use for the mars landscape george

838.959 --> 843.8389999999999
sanford

839.6 --> 843.839
that's what it's called

854.959 --> 857.8389999999999
hmm

865.12 --> 867.36
oh

868.839 --> 875.6
man

871.44 --> 875.6
i need to find a way to shift my

877.279 --> 882.8
my day night rhythm around because it's

880.079 --> 885.92
sliding down it's like sliding into the

882.8 --> 889.4399999999999
very very late like i notice it

885.92 --> 892.4799999999999
because also like the

889.44 --> 894.32
impulses of when you get hungry when you

892.48 --> 896.399
typically eat and all that and the

894.32 --> 897.7600000000001
habits that you have to wheel towards

896.399 --> 900.32
yourself there with

897.76 --> 902.3199999999999
like it's just become too difficult it's

900.32 --> 905.839
all shifting it's all like constantly

902.32 --> 905.839
pushing my impulse is just

906.0 --> 912.56
like even with food i

909.12 --> 915.44
i just don't get hungry

912.56 --> 916.88
on that time anymore it's like it gets

915.44 --> 920.0790000000001
later it it

916.88 --> 921.92
very weird how that works out but it's

920.079 --> 923.8389999999999
getting a little bit problematic because

921.92 --> 927.4399999999999
hey my show is

923.839 --> 931.1990000000001
on a fixed time so even though i

927.44 --> 934.639
don't seem to be again i'm like

931.199 --> 934.639
shifting in time again

935.6 --> 941.839
still have to deal with the show of

938.839 --> 941.839
course

942.0 --> 955.839
so i'm gonna try to find out how to get

945.12 --> 955.839
myself to bed earlier

960.399 --> 967.04
that's funny dr gonzo oh

964.0 --> 970.48
dr gonza says doesn't it

967.04 --> 973.04
bother me that the flat earth community

970.48 --> 974.8000000000001
doesn't progress scientifically

973.04 --> 976.16
like the flat earth debate it's the same

974.8 --> 979.4399999999999
toxic topics

976.16 --> 983.199
discussed every single day

979.44 --> 984.639
well where's the progression at

983.199 --> 987.3599999999999
because i'm pretty sure there is

984.639 --> 987.36
progression

988.0 --> 995.04
it yeah we're progressing

991.68 --> 998.3199999999999
in understanding the key

995.04 --> 999.519
factors that are problematic for the

998.32 --> 1002.0790000000001
global belief

999.519 --> 1004.24
so yeah the progress might not be even

1002.079 --> 1004.2399999999999
in

1005.079 --> 1011.4399999999999
continuing on top

1008.24 --> 1015.04
of the basic physics understanding that

1011.44 --> 1018.399
we are getting a lot of certainty about

1015.04 --> 1021.519
right it's not like

1018.399 --> 1024.079
yeah physics progress

1021.519 --> 1026.799
necessarily too much although we we are

1024.079 --> 1029.839
mastering the foundations constantly

1026.799 --> 1033.039
better and better so there is not an

1029.839 --> 1036.1599999999999
actual scientific progress but there is

1033.039 --> 1036.64
a lot of inside progress but at the same

1036.16 --> 1038.88
time

1036.64 --> 1040.48
much of the progress is actually not in

1038.88 --> 1044.24
the physics field

1040.48 --> 1047.839
it's in the field of psychology and of

1044.24 --> 1051.1200000000001
semantics of how do you

1047.839 --> 1054.0
apply words correctly

1051.12 --> 1054.9599999999998
how do misunderstandings happening

1054.0 --> 1057.12
happen

1054.96 --> 1059.28
and how do you recognize them how do you

1057.12 --> 1060.559
see them coming how do you relay a

1059.28 --> 1063.52
mistake

1060.559 --> 1064.96
you know somebody is going to make to

1063.52 --> 1068.32
them

1064.96 --> 1069.8400000000001
the such things so there is a lot of

1068.32 --> 1076.1599999999999
progression actually dr

1069.84 --> 1078.3999999999999
ganzo right it's just not in the field

1076.16 --> 1080.72
that specific little corner in that

1078.4 --> 1083.52
specific little way

1080.72 --> 1086.16
no not so much but there is a lot of

1083.52 --> 1086.16
progression

1090.799 --> 1094.799
oh my god yeah there have been

1092.799 --> 1098.24
experiments done dr gonzo

1094.799 --> 1099.679
sleeping warrior has done experiments

1098.24 --> 1103.2
you know the relative density

1099.679 --> 1105.8400000000001
experiments so now i've been on camera

1103.2 --> 1108.0800000000002
repeatedly many many times and different

1105.84 --> 1110.9189999999999
people have done that

1108.08 --> 1113.9189999999999
there's been so many field

1110.919 --> 1113.919
demonstrations

1118.48 --> 1125.76
so again it's just outright claim no it

1121.919 --> 1128.0800000000002
why don't we do it yeah we do do that

1125.76 --> 1128.08
we do

1129.2 --> 1137.039
he wore a white coat and everything yeah

1131.6 --> 1139.039
that's right

1137.039 --> 1141.12
did i just confirm that flatter this

1139.039 --> 1143.919
merely psychological no no no

1141.12 --> 1144.6399999999999
no i didn't i just confirmed that that

1143.919 --> 1148.0
is

1144.64 --> 1150.64
a lot of the field

1148.0 --> 1152.24
that we are progressing in concerning

1150.64 --> 1157.039
flat earth now it's not

1152.24 --> 1157.039
just that feel or there is more

1158.16 --> 1165.2
it's just that this is the most urgent

1162.0 --> 1169.6
literally in your face issue

1165.2 --> 1172.0
that requires resolving so that's

1169.6 --> 1173.28
what we're dealing with and when you

1172.0 --> 1177.2
deal with things

1173.28 --> 1180.48
you improve you gain skill

1177.2 --> 1183.3600000000001
right so it's kind of

1180.48 --> 1184.4
but yeah forced by circumstances that we

1183.36 --> 1186.8799999999999
are

1184.4 --> 1187.6000000000001
progressing in the psychological aspect

1186.88 --> 1190.8400000000001
because we

1187.6 --> 1193.84
get yeah it gets shoved in their face

1190.84 --> 1193.84
continually

1199.03 --> 1202.079
[Music]

1204.84 --> 1207.84
right

1211.919 --> 1217.3600000000001
we get faced with the

1215.039 --> 1220.4
with the very triggering word that they

1217.36 --> 1223.6789999999999
made up yesterday

1220.4 --> 1225.2800000000002
was kind of shocking like i even watched

1223.679 --> 1227.76
that back and i thought it was kind of

1225.28 --> 1227.76
shocking

1228.72 --> 1236.24
right the idea of intellectual

1232.64 --> 1238.88
suicide bombers and yeah that

1236.24 --> 1239.919
that word those two words put together

1238.88 --> 1243.1200000000001
the last

1239.919 --> 1244.0
two of the three yeah that's just very

1243.12 --> 1245.9189999999999
shocking

1244.0 --> 1247.6
like every time it's like it i

1245.919 --> 1251.44
understand that

1247.6 --> 1251.4399999999998
but what i meant

1251.919 --> 1258.7990000000002
it's intellectual the region

1254.96 --> 1262.32
they do that is within the intellect

1258.799 --> 1262.8799999999999
right it's i guess i've been watching a

1262.32 --> 1266.0
little bit

1262.88 --> 1268.0800000000002
much south park maybe too much

1266.0 --> 1269.12
because they do that sort of thing all

1268.08 --> 1271.6789999999999
the time and they

1269.12 --> 1276.559
actually visually and theatrically

1271.679 --> 1280.72
presented it's amazing

1276.559 --> 1280.72
so i kind of did that trick myself

1281.919 --> 1285.2
but i'm not gonna persist in calling you

1284.4 --> 1287.44
that

1285.2 --> 1290.96
or anybody out there like even if they

1287.44 --> 1294.799
deserve it it's like

1290.96 --> 1297.52
you know when that [ __ ] happens

1294.799 --> 1299.36
yeah you can call it that you but you

1297.52 --> 1301.2
don't have to say it every single time

1299.36 --> 1305.6789999999999
at some point you just know it's like oh

1301.2 --> 1309.039
god here here he goes again

1305.679 --> 1310.5590000000002
right go totally nuts

1309.039 --> 1312.48
splatter all over the place

1310.559 --> 1319.84
intellectually yeah

1312.48 --> 1319.84
it's one not another one of those

1330.4 --> 1333.8400000000001
it's okay terminoid

1335.76 --> 1340.24
but does intellectual kamikaze bring

1338.0 --> 1344.32
great honor as well

1340.24 --> 1344.32
or does it just bring great confusion

1358.84 --> 1361.84
no

1368.24 --> 1372.48
what's the connection between psychology

1370.48 --> 1375.919
and cold hard physics

1372.48 --> 1379.679
well cold hard physics

1375.919 --> 1382.7990000000002
you know physics involved experiment

1379.679 --> 1384.64
experiments yeah they have to actually

1382.799 --> 1387.52
be performed by people

1384.64 --> 1388.24
as in they are the controller of the

1387.52 --> 1391.679
information

1388.24 --> 1394.08
process right

1391.679 --> 1394.96
that in the information that involves an

1394.08 --> 1397.1999999999998
experiment

1394.96 --> 1398.72
and then executing it physically so

1397.2 --> 1401.28
there's going to be people involved and

1398.72 --> 1404.96
when people are involved

1401.28 --> 1408.24
yet you're bound to deal with psychology

1404.96 --> 1411.44
because who's to say that these people

1408.24 --> 1414.72
are just super focused for example

1411.44 --> 1417.3600000000001
right or that they're not like

1414.72 --> 1417.919
haunted by some media distraction or

1417.36 --> 1421.1999999999998
that they're

1417.919 --> 1423.5200000000002
zealous because of indoctrination

1421.2 --> 1424.32
right all these factors all come into

1423.52 --> 1427.12
play

1424.32 --> 1429.84
when dealing with cold heart physics

1427.12 --> 1432.4799999999998
that is actually empirical because

1429.84 --> 1433.6789999999999
people have to execute it they have to

1432.48 --> 1435.1200000000001
do that

1433.679 --> 1436.799
and when people are involved there's

1435.12 --> 1445.84
psychology involved

1436.799 --> 1445.84
in the real world right so there you go

1448.4 --> 1459.8400000000001
there's your connection in the front

1463.23 --> 1467.989
[Music]

1480.48 --> 1487.44
how many physicists on flat earth woof i

1483.2 --> 1491.279
don't know

1487.44 --> 1494.72
every physicist that is on earth

1491.279 --> 1500.96
is on flat earth so how many physicists

1494.72 --> 1501.3600000000001
exist a lot now whether they know

1500.96 --> 1503.3600000000001
they're

1501.36 --> 1506.8799999999999
on a flat earth or whether they believe

1503.36 --> 1506.8799999999999
they're on a ball or something else

1507.279 --> 1515.84
that's psychological

1518.95 --> 1522.739
[Music]

1527.26 --> 1532.069
[Music]

1535.84 --> 1543.84
yeah i thought

1553.039 --> 1557.6
ngt who's that oh neil degrasse ty throw

1556.799 --> 1560.08
it

1557.6 --> 1560.08
whatever

1564.08 --> 1567.9189999999999
look everybody can disagree all they

1566.159 --> 1571.279
like

1567.919 --> 1573.679
facts are the facts

1571.279 --> 1576.4
you can't just pick and choose the facts

1573.679 --> 1576.4
that you like

1577.36 --> 1581.4399999999998
you can do is take every fact and then

1579.919 --> 1584.24
just

1581.44 --> 1585.279
render them open and completely lay out

1584.24 --> 1586.88
the roots what

1585.279 --> 1588.72
what they are where they come from how

1586.88 --> 1591.5200000000002
they have been established

1588.72 --> 1593.1200000000001
on what logical foundations they rest

1591.52 --> 1594.799
and you can do that with everything and

1593.12 --> 1598.32
then just

1594.799 --> 1602.6399999999999
not ignore things

1598.32 --> 1605.36
when you do that and when you do that

1602.64 --> 1606.24
that's when you realize that a lot of

1605.36 --> 1608.8799999999999
people just

1606.24 --> 1612.08
disagree because they want to believe

1608.88 --> 1615.3600000000001
what they want to believe

1612.08 --> 1619.6789999999999
they want to ignore the facts

1615.36 --> 1619.6789999999999
that disprove that belief

1620.08 --> 1623.6
or that they have ulterior motivations

1622.88 --> 1626.4
than to

1623.6 --> 1641.1999999999998
then just to be an honest representation

1626.4 --> 1644.3200000000002
of their opinion

1641.2 --> 1646.159
no i'm not ignoring any of those facts

1644.32 --> 1647.9189999999999
yeah i know celestial point rotation

1646.159 --> 1651.1200000000001
i've addressed it

1647.919 --> 1652.48
how many times do i have to how am i

1651.12 --> 1656.6399999999999
ignoring it how did i

1652.48 --> 1660.88
not include that fact

1656.64 --> 1664.24
within the explanations of my cosmogeny

1660.88 --> 1664.24
from multiple

1664.279 --> 1672.799
presuppositional offsets

1668.32 --> 1672.799
so i have addressed it

1673.6 --> 1683.84
don't straw me in franzen

1707.48 --> 1710.64
[Music]

1716.24 --> 1722.799
every mathematician physicist specking

1718.96 --> 1722.799
conspiracy concerning globe

1722.84 --> 1732.6399999999999
well as a mathematician or physicist

1728.32 --> 1736.24
to go against certain beliefs

1732.64 --> 1739.8400000000001
has some really impactful dramatic

1736.24 --> 1744.159
side effects on your life so

1739.84 --> 1747.76
most choose to just conceal that part

1744.159 --> 1750.159
about it because i think

1747.76 --> 1752.0
real physics should be smart enough to

1750.159 --> 1755.1200000000001
have figured it out

1752.0 --> 1758.64
they just don't want to deal

1755.12 --> 1761.52
with the backlash of people have been

1758.64 --> 1764.88
stepped all over their beliefs

1761.52 --> 1769.2
because people get really insane

1764.88 --> 1771.44
like just very bad so

1769.2 --> 1772.3990000000001
yeah a lot of them are just not going to

1771.44 --> 1774.48
speak out

1772.399 --> 1776.399
or they will vert you signal the globe

1774.48 --> 1779.2
or whatever keep it short

1776.399 --> 1781.6789999999999
just to get out of it and i totally get

1779.2 --> 1782.48
it i totally get that i do not blame

1781.679 --> 1784.799
them

1782.48 --> 1787.679
right because they are good at what they

1784.799 --> 1789.279
do with the math and the physics

1787.679 --> 1791.76
you know a lot of these people that do

1789.279 --> 1792.96
that they're not very good at people

1791.76 --> 1795.76
skills

1792.96 --> 1796.48
so and maybe some of them are i'm not

1795.76 --> 1798.24
saying that oh

1796.48 --> 1799.76
you're physicist mathematician that

1798.24 --> 1803.1200000000001
means that your social

1799.76 --> 1806.32
[ __ ] or something no no but

1803.12 --> 1808.32
on average a lot of people

1806.32 --> 1810.48
that have that skill that are really

1808.32 --> 1812.559
good they have a tendency to be

1810.48 --> 1813.679
less skillful when it comes to social

1812.559 --> 1817.52
interactions in

1813.679 --> 1820.8400000000001
ways not in the same way necessary but

1817.52 --> 1822.0
because just the energy shifted to the

1820.84 --> 1825.6789999999999
other

1822.0 --> 1828.72
mechanism in their minds

1825.679 --> 1831.76
the other part it works better so

1828.72 --> 1835.1200000000001
yeah of course they're not gonna

1831.76 --> 1837.36
like create a social conflict

1835.12 --> 1840.7199999999998
by going against the grain with that

1837.36 --> 1840.7199999999998
because they want to have a life

1841.279 --> 1844.08
totally get it

1848.559 --> 1854.28
again psychological reasons

1851.08 --> 1854.28
[Music]

1856.32 --> 1861.519
yeah indifference that's right a lot of

1859.12 --> 1861.5189999999998
them do

1861.679 --> 1864.88
because they're people just like

1863.919 --> 1868.5590000000002
everybody else

1864.88 --> 1868.5590000000002
a lot of people make up [ __ ]

1869.76 --> 1875.6
to fit in or to to conjure up some

1873.44 --> 1881.2
confidence or to

1875.6 --> 1881.1999999999998
whatever seem cool people make up [ __ ]

1883.44 --> 1886.799
or they go with a story they think is

1885.679 --> 1890.0800000000002
popular that

1886.799 --> 1893.039
that one especially well guess what

1890.08 --> 1894.799
it's very much peer pressured and pushed

1893.039 --> 1898.48
in ways that

1894.799 --> 1906.559
talking about scientific progress with

1898.48 --> 1908.3990000000001
the globe in outer space is very popular

1906.559 --> 1910.6399999999999
because it's all over the tv and all

1908.399 --> 1910.6399999999999
that

1916.399 --> 1921.84
all right hey dutch seder

1932.84 --> 1935.84
sorry

1945.76 --> 1949.2
right classical homeopath that's a good

1947.679 --> 1951.039
one most don't even

1949.2 --> 1952.64
become suspicious that they are not on a

1951.039 --> 1954.0
globe right because it's

1952.64 --> 1955.919
because of the media that they're

1954.0 --> 1957.279
conditioned with look when you look on a

1955.919 --> 1959.44
screen

1957.279 --> 1961.12
and there's like science fiction stuff

1959.44 --> 1961.679
going on in there it's like ooh outer

1961.12 --> 1964.799
space

1961.679 --> 1967.279
spaceships flying through outer space oh

1964.799 --> 1968.1589999999999
going to a planet and in orbit of the

1967.279 --> 1971.279
planet

1968.159 --> 1974.72
right and then even

1971.279 --> 1975.2
within that thing they're talking about

1974.72 --> 1978.0
it

1975.2 --> 1978.799
they're talking about planets and so

1978.0 --> 1981.36
there's some

1978.799 --> 1982.32
confrontation on multiple levels verbal

1981.36 --> 1985.12
and visual

1982.32 --> 1987.12
it's all reinforced right well then if

1985.12 --> 1987.6
they just go about and they look up and

1987.12 --> 1991.84
they

1987.6 --> 1991.84
see the stars and all that

1992.64 --> 1996.72
they're already handed everything they

1994.48 --> 1999.3600000000001
need to just

1996.72 --> 2000.24
very easily like it is a giant black

1999.36 --> 2002.9599999999998
screen

2000.24 --> 2004.0
like a tv screen only this is supposed

2002.96 --> 2007.6000000000001
to be the reality

2004.0 --> 2007.919
screen so they just imagine it all they

2007.6 --> 2010.1589999999999
just

2007.919 --> 2011.1200000000001
imagine how that is that way it's very

2010.159 --> 2014.64
easy to do

2011.12 --> 2017.279
with all the conditioning from all sides

2014.64 --> 2018.0800000000002
even for me it's still kind of easy it's

2017.279 --> 2019.84
just don't

2018.08 --> 2021.76
make me imagine that the earth is

2019.84 --> 2024.6789999999999
spinning because that part

2021.76 --> 2026.08
is never going to work like even as a

2024.679 --> 2029.8400000000001
heliocentrist

2026.08 --> 2033.9189999999999
i'm a stationary earther yeah yeah

2029.84 --> 2036.32
oh now even my bow inside is getting

2033.919 --> 2038.159
controversial right yeah but i'm a

2036.32 --> 2040.08
stationary author i don't think that

2038.159 --> 2041.6000000000001
if the earth was a ball that it's moving

2040.08 --> 2044.559
i think that

2041.6 --> 2046.559
space-time is bending causing the

2044.559 --> 2048.56
universe around the earth

2046.559 --> 2050.079
to bend instead of the earth bending

2048.56 --> 2053.7599999999998
within it

2050.079 --> 2056.159
yeah because

2053.76 --> 2057.44
everything is at rest and moving in

2056.159 --> 2059.359
lockstep

2057.44 --> 2061.2000000000003
if it were moving and that's not really

2059.359 --> 2062.48
possible so i think that the earth is

2061.2 --> 2064.879
stationary

2062.48 --> 2066.2400000000002
even if it were a ball and the universe

2064.879 --> 2067.679
is spinning around it

2066.24 --> 2070.0
it's because of the bending of space

2067.679 --> 2075.839
time

2070.0 --> 2075.839
hello nathan by the way

2081.359 --> 2085.839
right and by the way such things that

2083.919 --> 2088.72
was also my problem

2085.839 --> 2089.2799999999997
even when i did not know the earth was

2088.72 --> 2091.7599999999998
flat

2089.28 --> 2093.599
and i didn't realize that yet and i

2091.76 --> 2095.8390000000004
believed in the bow i was like that as

2093.599 --> 2095.839
well

2096.96 --> 2104.2400000000002
i would have controversial

2101.119 --> 2107.04
sites on how it is because

2104.24 --> 2108.7999999999997
i just realized in the struggle to

2107.04 --> 2110.24
figure out what's going on and to

2108.8 --> 2114.32
reflect on it all

2110.24 --> 2117.839
try to make it fit people are just

2114.32 --> 2119.28
they don't realize what it is or how it

2117.839 --> 2122.0789999999997
works rather

2119.28 --> 2124.7200000000003
and in a way i got like this architect's

2122.079 --> 2124.7200000000003
view on it

2125.76 --> 2131.76
bypassing the realization that

2129.04 --> 2133.44
that it makes no sense that what i was

2131.76 --> 2136.5600000000004
engaging in

2133.44 --> 2139.76
so i i realized we were building it

2136.56 --> 2141.2799999999997
but i didn't realize what that meant i

2139.76 --> 2143.3590000000004
just knew how to do it

2141.28 --> 2145.599
and then i sought out controversial

2143.359 --> 2148.7999999999997
angles to things realizing

2145.599 --> 2150.8
that there's a lot of mysteries being

2148.8 --> 2152.88
conjured up and people were okay with

2150.8 --> 2155.28
that

2152.88 --> 2155.92
like officially everything they say

2155.28 --> 2157.8390000000004
about

2155.92 --> 2159.599
like gravity with black holes and all

2157.839 --> 2162.48
that stuff and

2159.599 --> 2164.6400000000003
wormholes all these things are just very

2162.48 --> 2167.68
acceptable

2164.64 --> 2171.2799999999997
even to me as a concept

2167.68 --> 2173.2
very acceptable right even though it is

2171.28 --> 2178.7200000000003
science fiction

2173.2 --> 2182.24
so if that is possible then why not

2178.72 --> 2183.4399999999996
basically suggest a heliocentric

2182.24 --> 2186.16
worldview

2183.44 --> 2188.96
that is a little bit more surreal but at

2186.16 --> 2191.44
least it freaking works out in some way

2188.96 --> 2192.0
and it's not just completely broken left

2191.44 --> 2195.2000000000003
open

2192.0 --> 2198.079
at every corner how about that yeah

2195.2 --> 2200.72
this is designers pride from my side

2198.079 --> 2203.28
it's designers pride

2200.72 --> 2206.16
i just don't like broken toys i want

2203.28 --> 2206.1600000000003
them to be whole

2208.72 --> 2211.2
i don't know

2212.16 --> 2218.64
i don't know who's going to agree

2215.28 --> 2222.2400000000002
with me about all this with anything i

2218.64 --> 2222.24
said in the last 10 minutes now

2226.88 --> 2229.839
uh

2231.359 --> 2235.92
right but because of my diverse

2236.64 --> 2242.7999999999997
angle of having dealt with the globe and

2239.72 --> 2246.3999999999996
heliocentrism and the belief

2242.8 --> 2250.0
i have so much psychological experience

2246.4 --> 2252.1600000000003
like i really really understand what it

2250.0 --> 2252.88
is to be a ball zealot because in a way

2252.16 --> 2256.72
i still

2252.88 --> 2259.04
am it's just that

2256.72 --> 2261.68
he ain't never gonna be full that it's

2259.04 --> 2261.68
real again

2262.0 --> 2264.72
fool me once

2265.2 --> 2268.16
ain't gonna fool me

2268.56 --> 2272.48
but i do still love the freaking glow in

2271.599 --> 2276.48
a way

2272.48 --> 2276.48
like what can be done with it

2276.56 --> 2283.04
it's just that people

2279.599 --> 2288.48
i don't know so

2283.04 --> 2291.599
like the the globe is wasted on globers

2288.48 --> 2294.32
really does isn't that funny

2291.599 --> 2295.6800000000003
to say that the globe is wasted on the

2294.32 --> 2298.079
globers

2295.68 --> 2300.0789999999997
they take it for granted it's like this

2298.079 --> 2301.119
this magnificent model with all these

2300.079 --> 2303.599
mysteries and

2301.119 --> 2304.1600000000003
there's always something to work on

2303.599 --> 2307.44
right

2304.16 --> 2310.96
very diverse

2307.44 --> 2313.2000000000003
but yeah the globe is just they just

2310.96 --> 2314.7200000000003
use it to prance around and just like oh

2313.2 --> 2317.7599999999998
look i'm i'm on

2314.72 --> 2320.0789999999997
i have this i have the globe they just

2317.76 --> 2322.32
don't deserve that model

2320.079 --> 2322.32
like

2324.24 --> 2327.68
you know why don't you act like a man if

2327.04 --> 2330.24
you're really

2327.68 --> 2331.2799999999997
if you're with the globe then why don't

2330.24 --> 2333.68
you

2331.28 --> 2341.76
represent the why are you tolerating all

2333.68 --> 2345.04
that nasty behavior out there

2341.76 --> 2348.1600000000003
why get political because

2345.04 --> 2351.52
some somebody out there

2348.16 --> 2355.2799999999997
that seems to have an directly opposing

2351.52 --> 2357.52
view and platform does it too

2355.28 --> 2360.2400000000002
because there's some there's people out

2357.52 --> 2364.4
there somewhere that are nasty to

2360.24 --> 2367.68
globers right

2364.4 --> 2369.599
your body the globe your model

2367.68 --> 2371.1189999999997
and the people that believe in it that

2369.599 --> 2373.44
really love it

2371.119 --> 2374.1600000000003
and there's somebody out there that

2373.44 --> 2376.56
allows

2374.16 --> 2377.7599999999998
bad behavior against globers and it even

2376.56 --> 2380.7999999999997
gets kind of political

2377.76 --> 2383.5200000000004
and where you get that feeling right

2380.8 --> 2385.44
who's to say it's okay that you can do

2383.52 --> 2388.24
that too

2385.44 --> 2391.599
that you can just let the people that

2388.24 --> 2395.52
are supposedly respectively on your side

2391.599 --> 2399.2000000000003
that it's okay to then just let them

2395.52 --> 2400.4
pile on and be really mean-spirited and

2399.2 --> 2405.04
personal and attack

2400.4 --> 2407.839
personal life aspects of somebody

2405.04 --> 2411.839
that doubts the globe that doesn't think

2407.839 --> 2411.839
it's real why is that okay

2412.64 --> 2418.56
i don't think that's okay as a glober i

2415.28 --> 2418.5600000000004
wouldn't think that's okay

2419.28 --> 2422.3190000000004
as a glober i would think the globe is

2421.28 --> 2424.079
wasted

2422.319 --> 2426.8
on most clovers because they don't

2424.079 --> 2426.8
respect it

2427.52 --> 2439.839
and they don't respect themselves

2442.4 --> 2446.319
dr gonzo you owe our win to us dollars

2445.68 --> 2453.839
what

2446.319 --> 2453.839
michael work

2456.56 --> 2461.52
oh dr gonzo oh you want to complete

2458.8 --> 2461.52
model do you

2461.839 --> 2465.68
that's it isn't it it's the chase to

2463.839 --> 2468.72
complete the model

2465.68 --> 2471.7599999999998
even though your model

2468.72 --> 2476.16
the globe is not complete in

2471.76 --> 2478.8390000000004
like every field there is incompleteness

2476.16 --> 2480.24
there is error every field it doesn't

2478.839 --> 2482.4
fit

2480.24 --> 2484.3999999999996
you have to literally just derail your

2482.4 --> 2488.7200000000003
sense of logical structure

2484.4 --> 2492.1600000000003
entirely to even feel

2488.72 --> 2495.839
that it is consistent

2492.16 --> 2498.7999999999997
so why do we flat earthers

2495.839 --> 2500.64
the political opposition why do we need

2498.8 --> 2502.88
to show you

2500.64 --> 2504.0789999999997
something similar that is supposedly

2502.88 --> 2507.359
correct and filled in

2504.079 --> 2509.2000000000003
why so you can point out how it is

2507.359 --> 2512.4
incomplete

2509.2 --> 2514.48
and that there's still things that are

2512.4 --> 2516.7200000000003
doubtful or probably

2514.48 --> 2516.72
why

2518.16 --> 2522.72
why do you need a model why don't you

2520.4 --> 2523.6800000000003
just go by the facts that you know and

2522.72 --> 2528.0
can

2523.68 --> 2530.24
figure out like very simple things

2528.0 --> 2531.44
why do we need a model why why do you

2530.24 --> 2534.0
need

2531.44 --> 2535.92
the entire architecture blueprint of the

2534.0 --> 2537.119
realm why do you insist on god's

2535.92 --> 2539.28
blueprints

2537.119 --> 2540.7200000000003
why do you insist on getting that why

2539.28 --> 2542.88
why do you think

2540.72 --> 2543.9199999999996
that even when you saw it you would

2542.88 --> 2548.88
accept it or

2543.92 --> 2551.839
understand it why are you being so

2548.88 --> 2551.839
high demanded

2554.079 --> 2557.119
yeah high demanding

2560.48 --> 2565.599
i mean as a flat earther limited

2563.359 --> 2568.319
representative

2565.599 --> 2569.6800000000003
limited no i do not represent all flat

2568.319 --> 2572.72
earthers absolutely not

2569.68 --> 2575.1189999999997
i would i hope they would see me

2572.72 --> 2580.319
in ways as a representative enough

2575.119 --> 2580.319
despite some of my my more

2582.72 --> 2586.8799999999997
dispreferable qualities i guess that

2585.68 --> 2589.839
don't make me pc

2586.88 --> 2589.839
enough or whatever

2589.92 --> 2593.6800000000003
i hope that they do represent but yeah

2592.24 --> 2597.04
as a flat earther i can say

2593.68 --> 2598.96
safely that we do know that the

2597.04 --> 2601.68
geometrical orientation of the earth's

2598.96 --> 2605.76
surface is flat

2601.68 --> 2607.839
and we know certain aspects about the

2605.76 --> 2609.3590000000004
realm mainly that it has to be contained

2607.839 --> 2612.56
because we have stable

2609.359 --> 2613.04
air pressure that we're breathing with

2612.56 --> 2615.839
the

2613.04 --> 2617.119
beautiful gradient that can only exist

2615.839 --> 2619.599
because

2617.119 --> 2620.8
the gas has filled the container there's

2619.599 --> 2625.04
no more vacuum left

2620.8 --> 2625.04
to rush into and

2625.76 --> 2634.2400000000002
we know that the heavenly lights

2631.28 --> 2637.119
very unlikely to have any physical

2634.24 --> 2637.1189999999997
origin point

2637.599 --> 2644.1600000000003
within the physical confines

2641.839 --> 2645.44
they don't seem to be physical in any

2644.16 --> 2647.7599999999998
sort

2645.44 --> 2651.76
that that much we know i think that's

2647.76 --> 2651.76
becoming much wider accepted now

2652.96 --> 2657.44
and i'm very glad of it because it is a

2655.119 --> 2658.6400000000003
huge obstacle it is really tough to get

2657.44 --> 2662.7200000000003
over that one

2658.64 --> 2666.16
because it's like taking away the 3d

2662.72 --> 2669.2799999999997
from outer space it is just

2666.16 --> 2669.7599999999998
realizing like all that it's all not

2669.28 --> 2673.92
true

2669.76 --> 2679.28
not even remotely that entire

2673.92 --> 2679.28
universe thing is just the 3d

2679.52 --> 2687.599
fractal idea of something that in

2683.52 --> 2688.079
actuality is is just an apparent sphere

2687.599 --> 2689.92
of

2688.079 --> 2692.0
lights that are not even in specific

2689.92 --> 2704.48
positions around a

2692.0 --> 2707.599
it's a big shift can be very tough

2704.48 --> 2711.2
flat is not an orientation note the

2707.599 --> 2711.2000000000003
geometric orientation

2711.68 --> 2716.16
right flat is an aspect about the

2716.839 --> 2719.839
geometry

2721.839 --> 2726.24
so we know the earth is flat now we

2724.72 --> 2728.8799999999997
don't know exactly

2726.24 --> 2730.16
what the confines are exactly what the

2728.88 --> 2733.359
shape of it is

2730.16 --> 2736.0789999999997
how big it really is if they're yeah

2733.359 --> 2739.92
and i personally even put some extra

2736.079 --> 2743.44
doubts on top of that mainly that

2739.92 --> 2745.599
the very nature of space spatiality

2743.44 --> 2746.96
is linear i have doubts about that i

2745.599 --> 2750.079
think there might be some

2746.96 --> 2752.319
warping going on just natural inherent

2750.079 --> 2754.8
by design as part of the mechanics of

2752.319 --> 2758.48
the designed realm

2754.8 --> 2760.48
and i love to explore those conceptions

2758.48 --> 2761.92
i have no absolute certainty about them

2760.48 --> 2764.88
but i suspect it

2761.92 --> 2765.44
and i have figured out how to test it i

2764.88 --> 2767.76
haven't

2765.44 --> 2770.4
actually tested it because then i'd have

2767.76 --> 2774.1600000000003
to go all over the place

2770.4 --> 2778.56
and i mostly just stay here

2774.16 --> 2781.44
in this city not a field guy

2778.56 --> 2781.44
so far at least

2783.44 --> 2790.0
so yeah that's the information

2786.56 --> 2792.4
pretty much you can

2790.0 --> 2795.76
extract all kinds of data but you have

2792.4 --> 2799.64
this data this data is present

2795.76 --> 2802.3190000000004
it's the same data that you base your

2799.64 --> 2804.96
ideocentric conceptions on when you add

2802.319 --> 2808.56
all the extra machinations

2804.96 --> 2812.56
in the mind experiments that same

2808.56 --> 2815.92
data is the data that flat earthers will

2812.56 --> 2819.119
have available for modeling out how the

2815.92 --> 2821.119
flat earth realm works

2819.119 --> 2822.8
right it's just data it's just things

2821.119 --> 2825.119
that have been measured now the the

2822.8 --> 2826.88
conclusions you draw

2825.119 --> 2831.44
from looking through that data that's

2826.88 --> 2845.839
another thing

2831.44 --> 2845.839
but the data is the data anyway

2846.56 --> 2849.92
[Music]

2855.119 --> 2862.96
i don't know do they

2859.68 --> 2866.72
like what projection mat what

2862.96 --> 2870.839
map projection are you using

2866.72 --> 2874.3999999999996
to make these connecting lines with

2870.839 --> 2877.599
yeah map projection as in

2874.4 --> 2879.28
not a physical literal representation of

2877.599 --> 2882.079
the realm content

2879.28 --> 2888.4
it's a map projection so which map

2882.079 --> 2892.319
projection are you using to connect

2888.4 --> 2892.319
the megalithic structures in the realm

2894.8 --> 2900.319
could they could the alignment of the

2898.88 --> 2903.119
megaliths

2900.319 --> 2905.359
hold the key of exposing where we live

2903.119 --> 2908.8
how

2905.359 --> 2910.4
how do they do that you mean they have

2908.8 --> 2913.04
to line up in some

2910.4 --> 2915.44
way in a certain projection in order for

2913.04 --> 2917.599
you to then reify that projection into

2915.44 --> 2921.52
physical reality

2917.599 --> 2924.559
or are we actually going to figure out

2921.52 --> 2929.839
what is the real euclidean orientation

2924.559 --> 2929.8390000000004
of the realm

2941.119 --> 2945.359
they connect by line of sight what

2947.76 --> 2951.119
that makes no sense to me

2951.76 --> 2970.3190000000004
oh hello georgie mythique

2956.4 --> 2972.96
good at you

2970.319 --> 2974.4
sorry foul and buchanan but you're

2972.96 --> 2978.079
starting to make

2974.4 --> 2980.2400000000002
less and less sense to me so

2978.079 --> 2982.1600000000003
what line of sight between megalithic

2980.24 --> 2983.359
structures what line of sight i asked

2982.16 --> 2986.0789999999997
you about

2983.359 --> 2988.0
what map projection are you using to

2986.079 --> 2990.079
connect them

2988.0 --> 2993.119
because they're taking that you're

2990.079 --> 2995.92
connecting them like dots on a map

2993.119 --> 2997.599
right so which map are you using and did

2995.92 --> 3000.8
you know that all maps

2997.599 --> 3003.599
all maps we have available to use are

3000.8 --> 3003.599
projections

3004.16 --> 3013.839
did you know that

3023.599 --> 3029.44
do you take the viewpoint of the

3025.44 --> 3031.839
biblical text as your religious beliefs

3029.44 --> 3034.319
i don't take anything as my religious

3031.839 --> 3034.319
beliefs

3034.64 --> 3041.1189999999997
but i do reflect upon

3037.92 --> 3042.8
what is said in the bible i wouldn't

3041.119 --> 3044.1600000000003
even call that a viewpoint that's

3042.8 --> 3046.7200000000003
already

3044.16 --> 3048.16
more further than i'm willing to go and

3046.72 --> 3050.7999999999997
i'm willing to

3048.16 --> 3050.7999999999997
figure out

3052.559 --> 3058.6400000000003
how mostly jesus christ figured out

3055.839 --> 3058.64
a way to

3058.88 --> 3066.6400000000003
promote the good and to

3062.079 --> 3070.319
delegate situations even onto the future

3066.64 --> 3073.7599999999998
what to create just the best solution

3070.319 --> 3073.7599999999998
to find a way through

3076.0 --> 3080.8
so all these supposed opinions and

3079.52 --> 3084.4
viewpoints

3080.8 --> 3085.92
that people have about the bible or as a

3084.4 --> 3090.319
christian

3085.92 --> 3092.64
i i don't really care about that too

3090.319 --> 3092.64
much

3093.76 --> 3097.0400000000004
it's the book supposed to be for

3095.76 --> 3099.0400000000004
yourself

3097.04 --> 3100.319
for yourself to reflect on and then

3099.04 --> 3102.88
realize

3100.319 --> 3104.0
how do things work how do they really

3102.88 --> 3107.599
work

3104.0 --> 3111.76
how does god give consequences

3107.599 --> 3115.6800000000003
for things through creation

3111.76 --> 3118.48
right it's creation itself

3115.68 --> 3119.9199999999996
through creation you get the

3118.48 --> 3122.2400000000002
consequences so

3119.92 --> 3124.559
there's just things that are laid out

3122.24 --> 3127.5989999999997
like if you do this

3124.559 --> 3129.8390000000004
then you could say god gets angry now

3127.599 --> 3131.76
that could mean several things

3129.839 --> 3133.2799999999997
that could mean that a group that

3131.76 --> 3136.8
champions

3133.28 --> 3140.96
god could get angry or it could mean

3136.8 --> 3143.52
that simply the act of doing such things

3140.96 --> 3146.48
come with natural consequences built

3143.52 --> 3146.48
into the design

3146.8 --> 3150.96
right so it's a warning about the

3149.04 --> 3154.0
natural obstacles

3150.96 --> 3155.68
as part of the design that's how i like

3154.0 --> 3158.0
to see the bible

3155.68 --> 3158.0
it's

3159.2 --> 3164.72
yeah it's just a book with incredibly

3161.44 --> 3164.7200000000003
valuable lessons about

3165.04 --> 3171.52
code of conduct purity

3168.559 --> 3172.6400000000003
and just the realization of that

3171.52 --> 3177.44
spectrum

3172.64 --> 3177.44
between darkness and light and that

3178.72 --> 3185.68
it's different it's different

3182.64 --> 3195.839
to be in those frequencies

3185.68 --> 3195.839
that's what i like about it

3198.05 --> 3201.119
[Music]

3203.68 --> 3209.839
a knee-jerk reaction what was your

3207.04 --> 3209.839
question

3210.8 --> 3215.44
or is it nor your knee jerk reaction

3217.599 --> 3225.76
not usual left field thinking what

3222.4 --> 3228.7200000000003
not my usual left what

3225.76 --> 3229.8390000000004
what does that mean i know what left

3228.72 --> 3232.24
field means but

3229.839 --> 3234.88
like since when am i left field thinking

3232.24 --> 3234.8799999999997
what is that

3235.28 --> 3240.2400000000002
you can't categorize me my thinking

3238.48 --> 3243.2
can't be categorized

3240.24 --> 3243.2
it's arwenian

3243.44 --> 3246.88
you ain't categorizing me

3247.68 --> 3252.8799999999997
or is that what they call left field ah

3250.4 --> 3255.119
paradox

3252.88 --> 3256.96
you can't agree to being left field

3255.119 --> 3265.839
because then you're not left field

3256.96 --> 3265.839
ah just kidding guys

3267.04 --> 3279.839
right outside of the norm

3290.839 --> 3295.58
dude

3292.96 --> 3297.2
mellow fellow are you still on to that

3295.58 --> 3300.24
[Music]

3297.2 --> 3304.64
already explain what that means

3300.24 --> 3306.64
multiple spheres they all have edges

3304.64 --> 3307.92
or you could say they all have an edge

3306.64 --> 3310.799
right one sphere

3307.92 --> 3311.52
doesn't have edges you can never have

3310.799 --> 3315.359
edges

3311.52 --> 3317.599
just one sphere but multiple spheres can

3315.359 --> 3317.5989999999997
have

3317.839 --> 3324.24
edges because each sphere has an edge

3321.44 --> 3326.0
so yeah it's not the most elegant way of

3324.24 --> 3326.8799999999997
putting it down but i put it down like

3326.0 --> 3329.119
that

3326.88 --> 3330.88
kind of on purpose to trigger certain

3329.119 --> 3332.319
people a little because i know they were

3330.88 --> 3334.6400000000003
going to have

3332.319 --> 3336.4
geometric trigger responses that was

3334.64 --> 3339.92
part of the trick

3336.4 --> 3341.04
right because they can only think in

3339.92 --> 3343.44
geometry

3341.04 --> 3346.24
and when you google it only geometric

3343.44 --> 3349.28
answers are given even so

3346.24 --> 3352.8799999999997
but technically i am correct

3349.28 --> 3352.88
spheres have edges

3353.76 --> 3359.92
right because each sphere has an edge

3356.96 --> 3359.92
has an edge

3360.079 --> 3364.319
so when you have spheres

3364.559 --> 3371.6800000000003
then you have the edges

3368.64 --> 3371.68
of each sphere

3373.76 --> 3377.76
or the edge of each sphere so it is

3376.559 --> 3379.92
technically correct

3377.76 --> 3381.3590000000004
it's maybe not the most elegant way of

3379.92 --> 3383.52
putting it down

3381.359 --> 3386.41
but i did that on purpose do you

3383.52 --> 3387.52
understand i did that on purpose

3386.41 --> 3391.839
[Music]

3387.52 --> 3391.839
should be blatantly obvious

3396.799 --> 3401.359
what do you mean dude oh come on mellow

3400.48 --> 3404.22
fellow

3401.359 --> 3407.31
come on

3404.22 --> 3407.31
[Music]

3407.68 --> 3412.3999999999996
it's not a geometric edge i did an

3410.24 --> 3415.4399999999996
entire hangout about it did you did

3412.4 --> 3416.88
did you blank out about that for crying

3415.44 --> 3420.2400000000002
out loud one and a half

3416.88 --> 3423.76
hour non-stop telling

3420.24 --> 3423.7599999999998
what it is what it means

3425.04 --> 3428.64
don't make me do that over and over

3430.839 --> 3436.319
again

3432.96 --> 3436.319
balls have outside edges

3436.4 --> 3439.76
right well they have visual edges take

3439.44 --> 3441.839
your

3439.76 --> 3443.119
no i'm not going to take your wrench why

3441.839 --> 3444.839
do you need me to take your

3443.119 --> 3446.6400000000003
oh you want to block somebody or

3444.839 --> 3449.119
something alright

3446.64 --> 3449.1189999999997
whatever

3455.28 --> 3464.3190000000004
kind of lame though

3461.2 --> 3468.3999999999996
anything to do with shapes oh really

3464.319 --> 3472.839
but what about the physical real world

3468.4 --> 3475.119
don't fears exist in the physical real

3472.839 --> 3478.799
world

3475.119 --> 3481.839
you know they're also known as balls

3478.799 --> 3481.839
or globes

3482.0 --> 3489.839
right you can call them spheres

3493.76 --> 3496.88
what's the objection

3497.2 --> 3500.16
right pill trill

3500.319 --> 3504.0
why are you falsely claiming that

3502.64 --> 3508.799
spheres

3504.0 --> 3517.839
are a geometric exclusive

3508.799 --> 3517.839
terminology they're not

3518.16 --> 3531.839
shares exist outside the geometry

3521.2 --> 3531.839
did you know that

3535.82 --> 3539.329
[Music]

3542.839 --> 3545.839
so

3552.319 --> 3556.319
maybe referring to perfect spheres well

3554.4 --> 3558.96
i didn't say perfect spheres i never

3556.319 --> 3561.2
said perfect spheres

3558.96 --> 3564.2400000000002
globe the globe earth is not even

3561.2 --> 3566.96
supposed to be a perfect sphere

3564.24 --> 3568.24
doesn't really matter only thing that

3566.96 --> 3572.16
matters is that

3568.24 --> 3575.359
when you look at a sphere it has an edge

3572.16 --> 3579.04
the edge is the demarcator line

3575.359 --> 3584.319
between where this sphere blocks

3579.04 --> 3584.319
things behind it in relation to the

3584.839 --> 3590.16
viewer

3587.2 --> 3591.5989999999997
that's the edge of the sphere so yeah

3590.16 --> 3594.8799999999997
i'm not gonna do that

3591.599 --> 3597.44
over and over again but man i i did

3594.88 --> 3601.6800000000003
certainly leave a mark on certain people

3597.44 --> 3603.359
up there must have been really hard to

3601.68 --> 3607.2
have

3603.359 --> 3612.0
a word put down not perfectly

3607.2 --> 3614.64
in line with geometric viewpoints

3612.0 --> 3616.4
right because if you would look at it

3614.64 --> 3619.52
spheres have edges

3616.4 --> 3622.079
from a geometrist only

3619.52 --> 3623.68
viewpoint yeah that's that's kind of

3622.079 --> 3627.52
insulting in ways right

3623.68 --> 3629.839
it's very triggering because spheres

3627.52 --> 3630.88
which you recognize in geometry

3629.839 --> 3634.0
specifically as

3630.88 --> 3637.359
that geometric shape

3634.0 --> 3638.559
they don't have edges a sphere doesn't

3637.359 --> 3641.7599999999998
have edges

3638.559 --> 3643.6800000000003
because an edge in geometry is like a

3641.76 --> 3648.079
corner

3643.68 --> 3651.52
you know we have faces faces

3648.079 --> 3654.8390000000004
and edges faces and edges

3651.52 --> 3657.7599999999998
that is what exists in geometry

3654.839 --> 3660.88
right but

3657.76 --> 3661.28
yeah that's from a geometric viewpoint

3660.88 --> 3663.76
that's

3661.28 --> 3665.3590000000004
when you look into what geometry

3663.76 --> 3668.8390000000004
consists of right

3665.359 --> 3670.799
the thing is there are things outside of

3668.839 --> 3675.68
geometry

3670.799 --> 3675.68
that utilize the same words

3675.76 --> 3679.28
understand things exist outside the

3677.599 --> 3682.799
geometry

3679.28 --> 3684.559
right so for example you can

3682.799 --> 3686.96
look at things and then you have these

3684.559 --> 3689.52
other fields called optics all these

3686.96 --> 3691.839
unique things that are existing in

3689.52 --> 3695.44
optics and don't exist in geometry like

3691.839 --> 3696.96
perspective things get smaller

3695.44 --> 3701.04
when they're further away from you that

3696.96 --> 3703.839
doesn't happen in geometry

3701.04 --> 3704.5589999999997
that's unique to sight vision

3703.839 --> 3707.92
perspective

3704.559 --> 3709.76
optics and in optics

3707.92 --> 3713.599
there are certain ways of describing

3709.76 --> 3716.6400000000003
things like say uh

3713.599 --> 3718.799
where does the objects split off

3716.64 --> 3721.0389999999998
from the transparent thing that you can

3718.799 --> 3723.68
look through we know as the sky

3721.039 --> 3725.039
right for as far as we can see and they

3723.68 --> 3728.16
call that a horizon

3725.039 --> 3729.2000000000003
or you could also call it an edge an

3728.16 --> 3732.0
edge

3729.2 --> 3733.1189999999997
if well if you presume that you're

3732.0 --> 3736.16
looking over

3733.119 --> 3736.88
a geometry of some kind a geometric

3736.16 --> 3739.44
shape

3736.88 --> 3741.119
that you're standing on and you can also

3739.44 --> 3743.52
call that an edge

3741.119 --> 3745.039
because just like when you look past an

3743.52 --> 3747.0389999999998
object and it doesn't even have to be

3745.039 --> 3747.8390000000004
sphere whatever man you look past it and

3747.039 --> 3750.559
it's like oh

3747.839 --> 3752.0789999999997
look did where you see the object and

3750.559 --> 3753.52
you don't see the object you only see

3752.079 --> 3757.2000000000003
what's behind it yeah that's

3753.52 --> 3757.2
called an edge

3757.52 --> 3761.599
that that's a correct application of the

3760.079 --> 3768.0
word

3761.599 --> 3772.559
right so so that's basically what it is

3768.0 --> 3775.28
an edge is not a corner oh really

3772.559 --> 3778.0
really in a geometry an edge is not a

3775.28 --> 3778.0
corner is it

3780.64 --> 3784.319
will you explain to me then red pill

3782.88 --> 3787.599
trill mr

3784.319 --> 3791.52
i am a geometrist explain to me exactly

3787.599 --> 3791.52
what an edge is in geometry then

3792.799 --> 3797.839
if you know it so well

3804.319 --> 3808.0
in the corner by the way is just a

3808.839 --> 3811.839
description

3821.28 --> 3828.799
oh oh you mean mellow fellow that

3826.559 --> 3830.0
god i've been saying that yesterday dude

3828.799 --> 3832.96
you were there

3830.0 --> 3835.839
i literally said that i've been saying

3832.96 --> 3835.839
it right now what

3836.839 --> 3840.88
dude

3838.24 --> 3843.1189999999997
yeah no [ __ ] yeah the geometry of the

3840.88 --> 3845.76
sphere doesn't have an edge i know

3843.119 --> 3848.0
i never said it was a geometric edge

3845.76 --> 3848.0
right

3848.24 --> 3852.72
but yeah a sphere is still a sphere in

3851.44 --> 3855.839
vision

3852.72 --> 3867.839
and in vision that sphere has an edge

3855.839 --> 3867.839
so dude

3886.16 --> 3892.799
right exactly the faces the faces

3890.24 --> 3893.5989999999997
you have the edge yeah i call it a

3892.799 --> 3896.96
corner it is

3893.599 --> 3900.0
technically the line but it is always

3896.96 --> 3903.52
defined in the mesh

3900.0 --> 3909.839
like a corner because it has to be

3903.52 --> 3909.839
otherwise it's not going to be an edge

3911.28 --> 3914.96
no howard moore i'm not on the edge it's

3913.599 --> 3916.96
just weird

3914.96 --> 3918.96
some people even on the flatter side

3916.96 --> 3920.319
here are having like this massive

3918.96 --> 3923.44
reaction

3920.319 --> 3925.599
it's like an allergic response to

3923.44 --> 3928.4
the title of my hangout yesterday it's

3925.599 --> 3928.4
pretty bizarre

3930.72 --> 3935.359
hey hello again yeah by the way samson

3934.799 --> 3951.52
good

3935.359 --> 3965.839
good to see you a long time i see

3951.52 --> 3965.839
vertices okay could be

3977.359 --> 3986.319
no that's no that's total nonsense dude

3982.48 --> 3993.44
that's absolutely ridiculous i had

3986.319 --> 3995.68
a's at eight pluses of my geometry tests

3993.44 --> 3995.68
right

3998.4 --> 4002.7200000000003
it's my best quality so this absolute

4001.039 --> 4007.8390000000004
nonsense dude you don't know what the

4002.72 --> 4007.839
[ __ ] you're talking about red pill trill

4019.4 --> 4022.59
[Music]

4023.119 --> 4029.44
right also

4026.64 --> 4031.68
realize that when i learned about

4029.44 --> 4034.88
geometry in school

4031.68 --> 4035.5989999999997
i didn't learn it in english right i did

4034.88 --> 4038.6400000000003
not learn

4035.599 --> 4042.2400000000002
geometry in english so these

4038.64 --> 4045.359
english geometric words

4042.24 --> 4049.5989999999997
it's been kind of a discovery on its own

4045.359 --> 4052.96
right i understand geometry

4049.599 --> 4057.039
i have very very strong spatial insight

4052.96 --> 4059.599
i'm very good at it but i did not know

4057.039 --> 4060.48
the words that are involved because

4059.599 --> 4062.4
there is

4060.48 --> 4065.119
quite a few words that are used in

4062.4 --> 4065.119
geometry

4065.2 --> 4069.2799999999997
that i've just never learned about in

4068.24 --> 4077.839
school because i

4069.28 --> 4077.8390000000004
i got it in dutch yeah

4082.16 --> 4088.319
yeah well i don't give a [ __ ] dude i'm

4084.16 --> 4091.52
not i'm not here to qualify

4088.319 --> 4094.72
i'm not here to qualify for you

4091.52 --> 4094.72
mr special boy

4097.04 --> 4108.319
you can figure it out just fine

4104.719 --> 4108.719
i am qualified to do this show because i

4108.319 --> 4113.1990000000005
don't

4108.719 --> 4119.12
need any test qualification

4113.199 --> 4121.04
what i do is the test

4119.12 --> 4122.64
and if i'm incorrect about something

4121.04 --> 4125.6
then you can

4122.64 --> 4127.12
show that you can reveal that to me that

4125.6 --> 4130.0
all you've gotten so far

4127.12 --> 4131.12
is just semantics just oh you might have

4130.0 --> 4135.12
not used

4131.12 --> 4137.5199999999995
the correct terminology for it exactly

4135.12 --> 4139.679
as i'm roughly trying to describe it

4137.52 --> 4140.400000000001
since yeah i never had geometry in

4139.679 --> 4142.719
english

4140.4 --> 4144.239
right english is not my first language

4142.719 --> 4147.12
thanks

4144.239 --> 4149.839
yeah so i don't have to do a geometry

4147.12 --> 4149.839
test to that

4150.239 --> 4161.839
because my geometry is just fine

4163.47 --> 4174.64
[Music]

4166.08 --> 4176.719
okay tom parker it was dr concept

4174.64 --> 4178.88
hello by the way julio pavin good to see

4176.719 --> 4178.88
you

4179.6 --> 4184.88
and yeah dr gonzo i did not go to a

4182.159 --> 4184.879999999999
university

4185.52 --> 4191.759
my brother did

4189.759 --> 4195.44
and through him i got exposed to some

4191.759 --> 4199.28
high level math at some point

4195.44 --> 4202.879999999999
so that i could get a feel of what

4199.28 --> 4205.92
what happens in that level

4202.88 --> 4209.52
when you get into real math

4205.92 --> 4209.52
what they're dealing with up there

4209.6 --> 4214.56
but math in itself is not something that

4212.0 --> 4217.679
i really like

4214.56 --> 4221.04
you know i like spatial things

4217.679 --> 4223.679
geometry that's what i like

4221.04 --> 4224.88
i'm good at it i have a great view

4223.679 --> 4227.92
assistance

4224.88 --> 4231.12
built in my mind for that

4227.92 --> 4234.08
but math is much more abstract

4231.12 --> 4234.08
i don't like it

4234.88 --> 4237.6
i just don't

4237.92 --> 4241.92
it's like this really convoluted

4242.84 --> 4245.84
language

4249.84 --> 4255.52
but it works you know but math does work

4253.04 --> 4257.5199999999995
it's just that yeah when you get too

4255.52 --> 4258.719
much into it you can literally drown

4257.52 --> 4261.76
into it

4258.719 --> 4263.04
and then start to believe some people do

4261.76 --> 4264.76
at least

4263.04 --> 4267.679
that just the mathematical

4264.76 --> 4270.8
representation is the

4267.679 --> 4286.96
is like the foundation of reality itself

4270.8 --> 4290.8
and that's just preposterous

4286.96 --> 4301.84
tired of talking about edges

4290.8 --> 4301.84
well you can only be edgy for so long

4302.0 --> 4307.28
or rather you can only talk about edges

4304.64 --> 4307.280000000001
before you

4309.76 --> 4315.84
go on edge get on edge what's the

4313.12 --> 4315.84
expression again

4320.4 --> 4329.839999999999
whatever i ruined it

4341.12 --> 4344.88
lose your ad yeah there's a lot of

4342.88 --> 4348.87
expressions with edges

4344.88 --> 4352.0
like that that have to do with composure

4348.87 --> 4352.0
[Music]

4355.44 --> 4359.599999999999
all right being on edge i think that was

4358.719 --> 4371.44
the one

4359.6 --> 4374.400000000001
i was looking for whatever

4371.44 --> 4375.5199999999995
right but i think that edges in that way

4374.4 --> 4379.12
psychologically

4375.52 --> 4381.679
have to do with attention spans

4379.12 --> 4382.32
it's very funny how that works like

4381.679 --> 4384.56
there is an

4382.32 --> 4387.12
edge in the attention span and it is

4384.56 --> 4389.52
subjected to a lot of expressions

4387.12 --> 4391.76
concerning people it's funny how that

4389.52 --> 4394.88
works see there's another edge

4391.76 --> 4396.64
outside the geometry it's a

4394.88 --> 4400.2390000000005
non-geometric edge

4396.64 --> 4403.4400000000005
another one so many edges

4400.239 --> 4406.959999999999
look at all the edges ah

4403.44 --> 4408.719
edges are all around the world is very

4406.96 --> 4413.84
edgy

4408.719 --> 4413.84
you know it's not just geometry

4416.16 --> 4419.47
[Music]

4422.08 --> 4426.8
[Music]

4453.04 --> 4457.76
all right yeah dr gonzo i i don't blame

4456.64 --> 4460.719
you

4457.76 --> 4461.4400000000005
like i if i'd had to choose right not

4460.719 --> 4463.199
that i

4461.44 --> 4465.44
am going to but if i had to choose

4463.199 --> 4466.08
between carl sagan and bill knight i

4465.44 --> 4469.839999999999
would

4466.08 --> 4469.84
i would choose carl sagan

4470.4 --> 4476.639999999999
because at least he tried to make sense

4474.08 --> 4476.64
in ways

4479.12 --> 4483.84
build nice just lame

4492.8 --> 4499.6
now georgie metic and unfortunately i

4496.48 --> 4504.32
don't think that they are

4499.6 --> 4507.120000000001
faking it you know

4504.32 --> 4508.08
kiwi has said it before too you know

4507.12 --> 4510.8
don't blame

4508.08 --> 4512.96
on cons like don't blame somebody

4510.8 --> 4515.52
conspiring when they could just be that

4512.96 --> 4515.52
stupid

4515.76 --> 4519.1990000000005
i think he said it differently

4521.04 --> 4525.28
yeah don't blame male intent and can be

4524.48 --> 4530.32
just complete

4525.28 --> 4530.32
ignorance i just got you get the point

4532.64 --> 4540.159000000001
so yeah people have a lot of trouble

4537.12 --> 4542.64
with just things even the one

4540.159 --> 4544.08
the things that they can be dealing with

4542.64 --> 4546.2390000000005
on a regular basis

4544.08 --> 4547.84
they just can't get things straight in

4546.239 --> 4548.4
their minds they just can't get it to

4547.84 --> 4553.84
fit

4548.4 --> 4553.839999999999
they can't accept it it's so tough

4554.0 --> 4557.6
carl sagan appear much more trustworthy

4556.719 --> 4561.12
didn't i

4557.6 --> 4561.120000000001
this is sure

4563.04 --> 4567.12
at least he seems like he's

4564.8 --> 4570.8
intellectually cohesive and not just an

4567.12 --> 4570.8
actor puppet pumping out

4570.88 --> 4581.84
prefab social engineering garbage

4574.159 --> 4581.839999999999
which bill nye on average is

4582.88 --> 4586.64
i don't know it's been long time since i

4584.64 --> 4589.04
even listened to carl sagan i don't even

4586.64 --> 4592.84
know what the typical subjects were

4589.04 --> 4594.32
i just remember that he wasn't like

4592.84 --> 4598.0
overtly

4594.32 --> 4598.32
onto that program too much he'd like to

4598.0 --> 4601.679
be

4598.32 --> 4603.5199999999995
just more intellectual speculating more

4601.679 --> 4609.679
that's what i remember i did get bored

4603.52 --> 4614.2390000000005
with him at times though

4609.679 --> 4623.84
but at least he seemed to be trying

4614.239 --> 4623.839999999999
to do something intellectually

4634.84 --> 4637.84
uh

4645.44 --> 4648.5599999999995
that robert gives the coordinates of the

4647.92 --> 4652.4800000000005
edge

4648.56 --> 4652.4800000000005
really tom parker you believe that

4656.56 --> 4661.679
diddy actually but do you really think

4659.44 --> 4665.839999999999
that admiral bird really

4661.679 --> 4668.2390000000005
got to the edge or did he do some field

4665.84 --> 4670.0
tests including the couple of planes

4668.239 --> 4672.0
that supposedly

4670.0 --> 4673.92
went down because they sort of bumped

4672.0 --> 4677.12
into a potential ceiling

4673.92 --> 4680.08
and did they then derive

4677.12 --> 4682.88
where touchdown point should be

4680.08 --> 4685.92
according to the derived geometry

4682.88 --> 4687.84
they just derived it

4685.92 --> 4692.32
who's to say they actually went there

4687.84 --> 4695.28
and touched it

4692.32 --> 4695.599999999999
maybe they just calculated it and just

4695.28 --> 4698.0
took

4695.6 --> 4701.4400000000005
that as yeah this is good enough

4698.0 --> 4701.44
nobody's gonna go there anyway

4703.6 --> 4707.1990000000005
you know maybe they they got sick of

4705.679 --> 4709.76
like they didn't want to

4707.199 --> 4710.4
like have their last toe freeze off and

4709.76 --> 4713.6
all that

4710.4 --> 4717.28
so there's like no no this is good

4713.6 --> 4717.280000000001
this good enough i don't know man

4717.76 --> 4720.88
i don't think there was any direct

4719.84 --> 4723.92
mention even of

4720.88 --> 4735.84
touching a dome or anything just a

4723.92 --> 4735.84
couple of sights

4738.08 --> 4742.159
the ice wall yeah a nice wall right so

4740.64 --> 4745.1990000000005
there's an ice wall somewhere

4742.159 --> 4746.879999999999
okay how does that mean why is an ice

4745.199 --> 4750.32
wall a dome

4746.88 --> 4754.08
or an edge is the ice has an edge

4750.32 --> 4758.08
sure does that make

4754.08 --> 4758.08
it the edge of the world

4758.48 --> 4761.919999999999
just because there happens to be a

4760.4 --> 4765.199
region where there's

4761.92 --> 4767.6
just huge chunks of ice

i'm just telling you don't do that

i i

4949.76 --> 4952.159000000001
what

4961.76 --> 4973.84
what i don't even know how to see

4964.8 --> 4973.84
how to read that

4983.84 --> 5001.84
is it like hispanic in origin

5006.639 --> 5011.12
alcohol issues related to effie no

5011.6 --> 5017.360000000001
i just don't

5015.12 --> 5018.8
want to make people that have issues

5017.36 --> 5022.0
with that

5018.8 --> 5022.0
have more trouble with it

5023.04 --> 5029.84
it's tough enough as it is

5040.84 --> 5043.84
so

5051.199 --> 5057.839999999999
nah jordan mitiga it doesn't look gaelic

5060.0 --> 5066.08
reaction to lost ancient language but

5063.04 --> 5069.199
how do you even know those words are

5066.08 --> 5069.199
like those letters

5069.76 --> 5074.56
are even literally the letters that we

5072.4 --> 5077.92
use

5074.56 --> 5077.92
you know if it's that ancient

5080.4 --> 5084.4
but i'd say like this could be like

5082.239 --> 5086.4
maybe south america or mexico or

5084.4 --> 5088.32
something in that region

5086.4 --> 5099.839999999999
that's why i say hispanic it might not

5088.32 --> 5099.84
literally be hispanic

5102.719 --> 5105.28
i don't know

5109.84 --> 5113.84
it is scottish gaelic what

5124.84 --> 5127.84
wow

5134.48 --> 5141.839999999999
i did not see that one coming

5166.84 --> 5169.84
okay

5172.62 --> 5175.84
[Music]

5193.28 --> 5196.8
it's interesting well i think it's

5195.44 --> 5199.919999999999
mostly confusing

5196.8 --> 5199.92
it's very alien

5202.08 --> 5208.159
and yeah it it primarily reminded me of

5205.6 --> 5212.88
spanish in some way

5208.159 --> 5212.879999999999
because just elements

5222.84 --> 5225.84
hmm

5228.71 --> 5231.869
[Music]

5232.96 --> 5239.84
did i find meaning in it no especially

5235.679 --> 5239.84
now that i know it's gaelic

5245.12 --> 5252.32
now maybe i'll go as far as to say that

5247.199 --> 5254.5599999999995
mar is about a lake

5252.32 --> 5256.799999999999
that i might just as well be wrong about

5254.56 --> 5256.8
that

5260.639 --> 5267.84
i really don't know anything about the

5262.96 --> 5267.84
gaelic language

5273.36 --> 5279.5199999999995
similar to germanic no no

5276.48 --> 5281.759999999999
not even close absolutely not in that

5279.52 --> 5284.639
direction

5281.76 --> 5285.6
germanic is very different from that i'd

5284.639 --> 5295.84
know because

5285.6 --> 5295.84
dutch is based on germanic language so

5306.84 --> 5309.84
hmm

5324.78 --> 5327.91
[Music]

5348.84 --> 5351.84
so

5351.92 --> 5357.6
yeah farolan you can share it language

5354.8 --> 5357.6
is interesting

5361.04 --> 5366.639
but as far as i'm concerned when it

5364.56 --> 5368.8
comes to languages

5366.639 --> 5370.8
i personally prefer languages that

5368.8 --> 5375.12
aren't dead

5370.8 --> 5377.52
that are still alive and that

5375.12 --> 5378.159
i'm very interested in the in the

5377.52 --> 5382.320000000001
process

5378.159 --> 5382.32
of language development how that works

5382.56 --> 5389.1990000000005
and how that like

5386.0 --> 5391.28
how temporary changes work like

5389.199 --> 5394.4
temporary

5391.28 --> 5397.5199999999995
creations within the culture

5394.4 --> 5398.719
and how do they last or don't they and

5397.52 --> 5402.159000000001
what do they mean

5398.719 --> 5405.12
afterward later

5402.159 --> 5406.879999999999
that part i'm very fascinated with so i

5405.12 --> 5409.44
am much into language but i'm

5406.88 --> 5410.4800000000005
a lot into living languages especially

5409.44 --> 5412.5599999999995
english because it's

5410.48 --> 5414.32
very widespread and there's a lot of

5412.56 --> 5417.92
variance

5414.32 --> 5421.84
variety in how to

5417.92 --> 5421.84
speak it

5428.96 --> 5435.84
but dutch is also interesting just don't

5432.48 --> 5435.839999999999
speak it as much

5438.0 --> 5443.679
the evolution of language yeah the

5440.239 --> 5443.678999999999
evolution of information

5446.84 --> 5449.84
yes

5458.8 --> 5463.84
right turquoise dragon

5471.84 --> 5479.679
including the word gay yes

5476.08 --> 5481.84
even things like certain types of like

5479.679 --> 5483.52
things that have become associated with

5481.84 --> 5486.0
negative issues

5483.52 --> 5487.1990000000005
like those words just become more

5486.0 --> 5491.84
prevalent

5487.199 --> 5491.839999999999
it's weird how that works out

5520.56 --> 5523.04
one

5530.84 --> 5533.84
hmm

5539.199 --> 5547.839999999999
all right be back two minutes

5572.84 --> 5575.84
my

5586.84 --> 5589.84
so

5642.84 --> 5645.84
so

5656.84 --> 5659.84
you

5680.08 --> 5683.44
stolen words

5684.4 --> 5690.96
oh my god

5687.76 --> 5690.96
fallen buchanan

5691.92 --> 5697.4400000000005
why stolen how can you steal

5698.84 --> 5701.84
words

5708.96 --> 5712.639
they just used the words

5712.88 --> 5716.08
they grafted it in

5725.119 --> 5730.159
cultural appropriation well yeah it's

5727.199 --> 5730.159
not gonna go away

5733.76 --> 5739.52
yeah how about we have the right to

5737.36 --> 5743.839999999999
culturally appropriate whatever the [ __ ]

5739.52 --> 5743.84
we want how about that

5749.84 --> 5757.84
we do

5765.52 --> 5771.84
thing about culture is it's up for grabs

5772.56 --> 5779.76
as in you can take on any culture

5776.4 --> 5782.638999999999
you like now

5779.76 --> 5784.88
other people might be offended for

5782.639 --> 5788.56
whatever reason

5784.88 --> 5792.4800000000005
and you have to be careful not to insult

5788.56 --> 5792.4800000000005
certain people that are very

5793.36 --> 5800.08
very long toes consult concerting

5796.4 --> 5803.759999999999
their culture right

5800.08 --> 5806.08
but technically yeah why not

5803.76 --> 5807.52
by adopting something within your

5806.08 --> 5809.84
personal culture

5807.52 --> 5811.4400000000005
from the outside you basically honor it

5809.84 --> 5815.360000000001
you honor that culture

5811.44 --> 5815.36
if you're dealing with it properly

5820.0 --> 5823.04
so this whole issue with about cultural

5822.0 --> 5827.84
appropriation

5823.04 --> 5827.84
is ridiculous

5852.84 --> 5855.84
so

5866.84 --> 5869.84
so

5876.0 --> 5880.84
language was imposed in britain not

5878.639 --> 5885.119
taken

5880.84 --> 5885.119000000001

it's the anglos and the saxons and

6037.119 --> 6040.96
all that they had their own kind of

6039.6 --> 6045.04
language

6040.96 --> 6051.28
and later english was really

6045.04 --> 6054.56
created was created

6051.28 --> 6056.8
by one group that would later impose

6054.56 --> 6065.84
that language on the rest of the

6056.8 --> 6065.84
the nation

6066.639 --> 6070.400000000001
it didn't just naturally come into being

6068.8 --> 6079.84
it was a designed language

6070.4 --> 6079.839999999999
and then it was imposed

6107.6 --> 6113.92
how do you know that farland buchanan

6901.679 --> 6907.28
it was great yeah it's been great

6904.48 --> 6909.919999999999
sorry for me basically having very

6907.28 --> 6912.0
prolonged silent pauses because

6909.92 --> 6912.96
i know it was getting kind of intense in

6912.0 --> 6916.4
the chat

6912.96 --> 6918.2390000000005
and i wasn't like i didn't eventually

6916.4 --> 6920.4
really know i couldn't really pick a

6918.239 --> 6924.718999999999
side anymore because it was just

6920.4 --> 6928.799999999999
yeah and then i just

6924.719 --> 6930.0
stay silent try to figure out what to do

6928.8 --> 6931.92
about it

6930.0 --> 6934.56
while it goes on and on and on it's kind

6931.92 --> 6936.4800000000005
of a habit i picked up

6934.56 --> 6938.159000000001
when i was a lot younger and my parents

6936.48 --> 6941.5199999999995
would constantly be

6938.159 --> 6944.48
in conflict about everything

6941.52 --> 6945.4400000000005
all the time and you can't pick a side

6944.48 --> 6947.598999999999
not really

6945.44 --> 6949.199
or you have to pick a side to basically

6947.599 --> 6952.96
achieve a certain bi

6949.199 --> 6955.36
type of behavioral switch right

6952.96 --> 6957.04
i couldn't spot anything that i could do

6955.36 --> 6960.719
at this point

6957.04 --> 6962.96
also since this full-on guy is new

6960.719 --> 6964.88
like i don't know him for that long i do

6962.96 --> 6967.199
know you for pretty long here we go

6964.88 --> 6967.1990000000005
again

6968.8 --> 6975.92
but you do get a little uh

6972.159 --> 6978.08
little sensitive sometimes

6975.92 --> 6980.08
i think it would be better for you if

6978.08 --> 6984.239
you would

6980.08 --> 6987.04
not react out as much as you kind of do

6984.239 --> 6988.879999999999
would be better for you because a lot of

6987.04 --> 6991.119
yeah people get really

6988.88 --> 6992.88
allergic responses and all that it's not

6991.119 --> 6993.5199999999995
even because of what you're saying it's

6992.88 --> 6997.04
because

6993.52 --> 6997.92
you are saying such things you let it

6997.04 --> 7000.32
out

6997.92 --> 7001.679
that even when you're not speaking it's

7000.32 --> 7004.32
it's out

7001.679 --> 7006.4800000000005
it's out there in the spirit ether and

7004.32 --> 7008.0
people then start to react something to

7006.48 --> 7011.28
something that's not even there

7008.0 --> 7014.48
yet it happens i've seen it happen

7011.28 --> 7017.5199999999995
i've seen it happen between my parents

7014.48 --> 7020.879999999999
right a lot of arguing

7017.52 --> 7022.080000000001
that arises between people is not even

7020.88 --> 7024.4800000000005
because of what they say

7022.08 --> 7025.199
it's because of what is actively

7024.48 --> 7029.678999999999
happening

7025.199 --> 7031.5199999999995
in the spirit outside of communication

7029.679 --> 7033.4400000000005
that they respond to this happens you

7031.52 --> 7035.360000000001
have to pay attention to this so that's

7033.44 --> 7037.598999999999
going to be the lesson that i'm

7035.36 --> 7039.679
truly rounding it out with in the middle

7037.599 --> 7041.92
of my rounding out

7039.679 --> 7044.88
anyway i will be back tomorrow flat

7041.92 --> 7047.84
earth early word number 811

7044.88 --> 7049.36
on the friday edition and i'm going to

7047.84 --> 7052.2390000000005
join the flat earth debates

7049.36 --> 7053.839999999999
which should start up any minute now

7052.239 --> 7059.839999999999
please take care

7053.84 --> 7059.84
and yeah take it easy

7059.92 --> 7064.719
you know everybody's going through

7062.32 --> 7067.199
hassles of all kinds

7064.719 --> 7069.36
lots of stuff even been happening in the

7067.199 --> 7071.36

7069.36 --> 7073.839999999999
