9.45 --> 44.17
[Music]

40.23 --> 48.489
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

44.17 --> 50.260000000000005
early-bird number 201 I'm your host

48.489 --> 52.15
Arwen and before we start the show

50.26 --> 54.489
please don't forget to share it on any

52.15 --> 56.44
platform you deem fit and also if you

54.489 --> 58.39
haven't already please subscribe to my

56.44 --> 59.86
channel and hit the bell notification so

58.39 --> 64.03
you know what I'm going live which is

59.86 --> 68.47
normally 2:00 p.m. amsterdam time so

64.03 --> 70.45
today is yeah a beautiful it feels

68.47 --> 73.96
totally like a summers day it's really

70.45 --> 76.36
freaking hot and the Sun is just intense

73.96 --> 81.58
there's no real clouds unfortunately

76.36 --> 86.979
though there cam trailing like a like a

81.58 --> 89.59
bastard like right now you can see it go

86.979 --> 92.11
right there they're continually spraying

89.59 --> 93.94
since the start of the day it's terrible

92.11 --> 99.13
and you can still see the remnants of

93.94 --> 102.67
the grid they left behind on such a

99.13 --> 106.149
lovely day it's terrible it will be

102.67 --> 108.039
worse in the evening I think they're

106.149 --> 110.47
probably counting on everyone to just

108.039 --> 112.09
sit outside on the terraces in the

110.47 --> 114.039
evening and then they're all going to be

112.09 --> 117.369
inhaling all that crap whatever it may

114.039 --> 125.93900000000001
be and I try to stay inside in the

117.369 --> 128.58
evening so today I have a apple and tea

125.939 --> 133.23
and then oh yeah I got some watery and

128.58 --> 138.14000000000001
the cooler downstairs so I'll get that

133.23 --> 141.35999999999999
as soon as I get thirsty for cold water

138.14 --> 144.29999999999998
you know what I think I'm thirsty for

141.36 --> 148.14000000000001
cold water don't really feel like

144.3 --> 151.19
drinking hot tea too much I'll go get it

148.14 --> 151.19
right now be right back

186.86 --> 198.10000000000002
yeah you so yeah that's gonna be nice

193.19 --> 198.1
hmm could be cooler Dover

207.51 --> 215.5
good stuff I'm so glad a switch from the

212.62 --> 218.799
old plastic bottle even though they'd

215.5 --> 220.599
haven't have a carbon filter in it but

218.799 --> 223.62900000000002
this just it's a world of difference I

220.599 --> 226.39
should have done that years ago but yeah

223.629 --> 228.57899999999998
those bottles are kind of neat if you

226.39 --> 231.629
use them for a year and I've been using

228.579 --> 236.34900000000002
them for way too long so stupid

231.629 --> 239.409
No I don't drink I don't really drink

236.349 --> 243.38899999999998
alcohol when I was sick cuz that's just

239.409 --> 251.29
stupid especially during the summer

243.389 --> 253.769
maybe in the winter but yeah if I drink

251.29 --> 258.21999999999997
I'm not gonna drink in this kind of heat

253.769 --> 261.099
and I'll do it in the evening yeah that

258.22 --> 265.36
could be awesome but yeah I'm I'm still

261.099 --> 267.96
in the middle of having a cold you can

265.36 --> 267.96000000000004
probably hear it

270.899 --> 281.759
so yeah I saw a really interesting

273.759 --> 285.099
hangout yesterday from new earth like on

281.759 --> 287.74
alternative healing and energy healing

285.099 --> 290.83
especially and she had a whole different

287.74 --> 293.709
lingo that I have heard words about that

290.83 --> 296.139
before but it kind of does make sense I

293.709 --> 304.599
think I understand what she's talking

296.139 --> 307.839
about in it but just seems like she her

304.599 --> 311.529
focus mechanically is different than

307.839 --> 316.899
mine so I don't know it was sometimes a

311.529 --> 318.519
bit hard to get through it she yeah some

316.899 --> 322.469
personal criticism I think she might

318.519 --> 322.469
have been a little bit overly nitpicky

322.769 --> 332.889
but yeah she she laid out some good

328.509 --> 338.97900000000004
concepts misjudgments but all those yeah

332.889 --> 341.469
eventually it became like there are some

338.979 --> 342.909
hippie people hippy dippy people out

341.469 --> 345.49
there that think they're healers and

342.909 --> 348.99899999999997
they can do stuff at times just because

345.49 --> 352.899
of the impulse but yeah they're not

348.999 --> 355.059
really they don't have a proper

352.899 --> 357.279
framework like if you're purely

355.059 --> 360.42900000000003
intuitive that's for example also why I

357.279 --> 363.879
never went professional with it because

360.429 --> 367.089
I basically when I do these things I use

363.879 --> 369.279
a momentum when my focus is very high

367.089 --> 371.559
and I just naturally see what I can do

369.279 --> 374.61899999999997
and I have it available to me and that I

371.559 --> 377.74
do it it's impulsively and if I would

374.619 --> 379.389
then try to force that that's where

377.74 --> 383.259
probably things go wrong and I've tried

379.389 --> 387.669
it before like not for money even but

383.259 --> 391.449
just over doing it too many times so it

387.669 --> 395.709
I don't know it was a very interesting

391.449 --> 398.979
hangout I think still so yeah do check

395.709 --> 402.789
it out Newerth she has some a lot of

398.979 --> 406.87
like ancient architecture stuff and

402.789 --> 410.409
weird phenomena apparently from ancient

406.87 --> 413.559
times and she does excursions as well

410.409 --> 415.719
like with a big group to go to these

413.559 --> 420.03900000000004
places and film it and everything it's

415.719 --> 421.599
it's a pretty good Channel so yeah I've

420.039 --> 429.209
been following her for a while

421.599 --> 429.209
or heard them it's the girl with the

429.449 --> 435.639
with the very much the sort of I guess

432.61 --> 437.409
Russian accent some people find it

435.639 --> 439.389
really annoying I find it kind of

437.409 --> 441.579
charming although combined with the

439.389 --> 448.079
nitpicky Ness it it does get a little

441.579 --> 450.639
bit annoying but I still love it anyway

448.079 --> 453.039
although yeah another it's not like oh

450.639 --> 455.759
my god after rewatched those streams all

453.039 --> 461.919
the time but she just has some very good

455.759 --> 465.72900000000004
unusual information here yeah she does

461.919 --> 468.219
dabble with ethereal stuff and also into

465.729 --> 471.00899999999996
old traditions ayahuasca based

468.219 --> 475.599
traditions and it's just a whole other

471.009 --> 478.769
world very witchy and I like it yeah she

475.599 --> 478.769
got contact definitely

483.02 --> 491.21999999999997
so yeah and yeah she has the best that

488.94 --> 496.1
channel is the best music ever like

491.22 --> 497.28000000000003
Alice a very old instrumental music just

496.1 --> 502.26000000000005
amazing

497.28 --> 506.03999999999996
music yeah anyway I like that a lot I

502.26 --> 509.33
feel good I like that type of music and

506.04 --> 513.03
I like the subjects like the channel

509.33 --> 517.6999999999999
anyway not Flat Earth by the way she did

513.03 --> 520.4
talk about uh about that but she like

517.7 --> 523.0500000000001
she pretty much

520.4 --> 525.39
well she's not outspoken about it she

523.05 --> 527.76
just thinks that Flat Earth ball earth

525.39 --> 530.31
is a distraction and you get cut in the

527.76 --> 530.76
fighting loop and she's she's got a

530.31 --> 534.78
point

530.76 --> 537.99
basically like and her focus and their

534.78 --> 541.26
meticulousness i guess she doesn't have

537.99 --> 543.66
the room to basically start learning how

541.26 --> 547.88
to psychologically box constantly with

543.66 --> 547.88
people so that makes sense right

550.94 --> 558.3800000000001
you know what I'll I'll post the video

554.12 --> 562.0
that I watched on my channel I post a

558.38 --> 562.0
link in the chat so you can take a look

562.48 --> 567.16
it's 1 hour and 30 minutes

572.76 --> 579.0889999999999
all right there you go yeah there's a

577.529 --> 581.1
good chance you're not going to be able

579.089 --> 584.3100000000001
to sit through it all in one go because

581.1 --> 588.66
it is literally her talking all the time

584.31 --> 592.4399999999999
so hey what's a lot of information so to

588.66 --> 594.6899999999999
me it's like I could compare like I

592.44 --> 597.99
watch videos like some people read books

594.69 --> 600.48
and sometimes it's just like the way it

597.99 --> 602.55
somebody writes is a little bit tough to

600.48 --> 604.0790000000001
get through and then you just read it

602.55 --> 606.18
and focus and then you get tired and you

604.079 --> 607.8
put it down and watch it or you read

606.18 --> 610.2299999999999
another day well that's how I watch this

607.8 --> 614.6099999999999
video it was very well worth sitting

610.23 --> 616.8290000000001
through it eventually so yeah also

614.61 --> 619.019
there's a bit of an echo on her voice at

616.829 --> 621.2399999999999
times yeah I know for an itch that's why

619.019 --> 624.149
I said there are some people out there

621.24 --> 626.85
that kind of find their voice annoying

624.149 --> 631.5
and I get that I find it kind of

626.85 --> 641.85
charming I don't know must be racist or

631.5 --> 644.459
something but I find it Jeremy anyway it

641.85 --> 646.41
would be good if she like reacted the

644.459 --> 648.26
whole thing without the freaking echo on

646.41 --> 652.639
her voice that would be a lot better

648.26 --> 652.639
because it's kind of distracting

658.61 --> 667.91
all right so anyway let's get on with it

661.699 --> 670.2489999999999
ah yeah on a totally left field

667.91 --> 672.049
quite literally signed out like some I

670.249 --> 675.049
bumped into something that just kind of

672.049 --> 679.97
weirded me out on Rt today that was so

675.049 --> 684.22
weird like probably most of you have

679.97 --> 684.22
heard of what is it

685.299 --> 690.22
President of the Philippines

687.679 --> 693.799
Duterte is like quite the controversial

690.22 --> 695.149
outspoken character that that's like

693.799 --> 697.309
really trying

695.149 --> 700.1
while he is basically accomplishing

697.309 --> 703.249
quite an alpha status also through the

700.1 --> 705.619
media and he's quite harsh and [ __ ] and

703.249 --> 709.249
like when he says something it happens

705.619 --> 713.619
in otherwise he's an interesting

709.249 --> 716.6
character but then that was weird today

713.619 --> 719.869
like apparently in some interview he

716.6 --> 724.059
said in the media like that he used to

719.869 --> 728.179
be gay and then cured himself like what

724.059 --> 730.809
what the [ __ ] okay it's a funny story

728.179 --> 730.809
actually

733.23 --> 744.14
it's weird and they in that article they

740.19 --> 748.32
kind of compare it to some other weird

744.14 --> 750.51
statements about it it's like it's it

748.32 --> 756.3900000000001
just brings a whole weird light down the

750.51 --> 758.61
whole thing so yeah that kind of freaked

756.39 --> 762.11
me out in a little I don't know what it

758.61 --> 767.1
is maybe he's just I don't know in some

762.11 --> 769.8000000000001
very weird mood or maybe he maybe it's

767.1 --> 772.9200000000001
just like that and he didn't think of it

769.8 --> 777.18
as much he just was all liberal and just

772.92 --> 780.6899999999999
went with it or something you know to be

777.18 --> 782.31
fair when I was younger like I I could

780.69 --> 783.8100000000001
pretty much recognize it now it's like

782.31 --> 785.9699999999999
okay there's some men aren't there

783.81 --> 790.17
there's like whoa when I see them I have

785.97 --> 793.98
like holy [ __ ] like that guy would be so

790.17 --> 796.14
such an incredible guy to be around with

793.98 --> 798.78
as a girl it's weird but I just

796.14 --> 803.52
recognized that this is like and I get

798.78 --> 804.24
like wow you know but I don't find that

803.52 --> 807.3299999999999
attractive

804.24 --> 810.0600000000001
and sometimes there's just guys that are

807.33 --> 818.46
kind of like mysterious still pretty

810.06 --> 820.5
cool and it's like I don't know it maybe

818.46 --> 823.4100000000001
it's like just confusing stuff but I

820.5 --> 826.41
like I am yeah my feelings not not

823.41 --> 829.65
sexual it's never sexual that's the very

826.41 --> 833.13
I want to emphasize that I literally am

829.65 --> 835.17
NOT a homosexual like absolutely not but

833.13 --> 840.62
I do have like feelings towards men

835.17 --> 844.2299999999999
sometimes but I'm like absolutely

840.62 --> 845.34
adamantly not willing to basically

844.23 --> 849.9
explore that

845.34 --> 852.5400000000001
like I like almost try that like and

849.9 --> 854.55
ended up kissing a guy that was like not

852.54 --> 856.56
female looking in order to like

854.55 --> 858.24
camouflage just like the straight-out

856.56 --> 860.9399999999999
tested with the guy that kind of like

858.24 --> 864.51
really looked like a guy

860.94 --> 868.1700000000001
and it almost made me throw up like it

864.51 --> 872.43
was just mmm no I am NOT a freaking

868.17 --> 876.05
homosexual I can guarantee it so I

872.43 --> 880.04
wonder if it is kind of like that or

876.05 --> 882.6899999999999
maybe maybe didn't have that

880.04 --> 884.4
predetermination or something as he grew

882.69 --> 887.0400000000001
up I don't know maybe it is an Asian

884.4 --> 889.11
thing it is the Philippines after all so

887.04 --> 892.0799999999999
I don't know I just thought it was

889.11 --> 898.47
really fascinating in a way like what

892.08 --> 901.2900000000001
the [ __ ] totally unexpected to me then

898.47 --> 907.83
again I don't have a very good gaydar as

901.29 --> 913.8
they call that because I am not gay I

907.83 --> 917.37
really don't get it so yes for an itch I

913.8 --> 922.67
am it's clear to all I'm just weird not

917.37 --> 925.98
gay I can be like the gay happy

922.67 --> 932.0899999999999
weirdness frolic II I can be frolic II

925.98 --> 936.09
but I it's not homosexual no it's just

932.09 --> 939.3000000000001
like a weird it's basically a form of

936.09 --> 941.6700000000001
mania a very children like form of mania

939.3 --> 946.0799999999999
that then expresses itself and I kind of

941.67 --> 949.5
kept it around for partial comedy I

946.08 --> 953.5500000000001
guess I don't know it's when I got that

949.5 --> 954.0
it's really accelerating to do that it's

953.55 --> 961.6999999999999
funny

954.0 --> 965.91
it just works and I don't know but yeah

961.7 --> 969.59
I don't like acting like gay like I know

965.91 --> 969.5899999999999
I could do it but it just

973.279 --> 977.7
yeah

974.58 --> 980.4590000000001
so another reason why Hollywood was not

977.7 --> 984.2700000000001
really meant for me if you know what I

980.459 --> 987.899
mean I didn't know that when I was like

984.27 --> 991.5
a teenager and everything and I didn't

987.899 --> 993.39
know like yeah homosexuality really was

991.5 --> 995.88
never in my scope naturally I always

993.39 --> 1000.02
just naturally avoided it like no I

995.88 --> 1003.4399999999999
don't care about this ya don't mind I

1000.02 --> 1008.5699999999999
just don't want to be looking at it you

1003.44 --> 1011.6300000000001
know that's all so that's my take you

1008.57 --> 1016.99
know fine if you wanna guess no one says

1011.63 --> 1020.209
it go dumpster pumping and everything

1016.99 --> 1034.52
that's fine just as long as I don't have

1020.209 --> 1038.02
to watch it you know anyway yuck yeah I

1034.52 --> 1038.02
definitely got a cold and

1043.92 --> 1051.03
yeah so I guess my system is cleaning up

1048.25 --> 1053.79
some [ __ ] and that's good

1051.03 --> 1056.68
she'd be careful with the smoking

1053.79 --> 1060.22
although yeah these filters do matter a

1056.68 --> 1063.16
lot like oh my god I remember when I

1060.22 --> 1067.24
kind of still smoked with without those

1063.16 --> 1070.8400000000001
years and years ago before I quit right

1067.24 --> 1072.67
yeah and then when I got sick I would

1070.84 --> 1076.6899999999998
just continue on smoking because I was

1072.67 --> 1079.0
just yeah I didn't really care and my

1076.69 --> 1080.95
god like that could aggravate the

1079.0 --> 1082.81
sickness so badly and it's not because

1080.95 --> 1088.15
of the cannabis it's because of the

1082.81 --> 1090.97
freakin tobacco yeah so it's good

1088.15 --> 1096.22
because I'm still smoking yeah but I'm

1090.97 --> 1098.68
just doing it carefully and with the

1096.22 --> 1101.92
filter [ __ ] yeah it really that really

1098.68 --> 1105.78
helps a lot more even than normally so

1101.92 --> 1105.78
yeah I'm gonna take a bite of this Apple

1109.69 --> 1114.52
hmm yep

1117.3 --> 1120.3799999999999
all right that's good

1129.31 --> 1132.47
[Music]

1132.809 --> 1138.46
but maybe it is kind of like a summer

1135.279 --> 1141.82
thing because in the winter I don't like

1138.46 --> 1147.52
apples I don't know why I just don't

1141.82 --> 1151.96
like him but yeah soon as the Sun Goes

1147.52 --> 1153.6689999999999
hot suddenly I just get these like fruit

1151.96 --> 1157.71
suddenly seems a lot more appealing than

1153.669 --> 1157.71
for some reason I don't know

1168.83 --> 1181.619
which chair that one yeah that's an

1176.85 --> 1187.4699999999998
interesting chair got it secondhand it's

1181.619 --> 1190.649
like a really British looking chair it

1187.47 --> 1195.989
still has some claw marks of my old cat

1190.649 --> 1199.1689999999999
I couldn't keep it away from it but yeah

1195.989 --> 1202.259
it's kind of a weird it's to be fair

1199.169 --> 1206.5490000000002
it's too big for me it's like a big

1202.259 --> 1209.099
man's chair but I don't know I still

1206.549 --> 1212.509
like sitting in it are like really

1209.099 --> 1215.609
hanging around when I like watch movies

1212.509 --> 1222.359
speaking of which I did watch something

1215.609 --> 1224.46
again yesterday was it again like I'm

1222.359 --> 1231.059
starting to just watch random [ __ ] now

1224.46 --> 1232.799
and that oh yeah that was awesome yeah I

1231.059 --> 1238.019
got halfway The Blues Brothers

1232.799 --> 1243.299
I got they they trash the place it's

1238.019 --> 1248.129
like oof so much trash it's just an

1243.299 --> 1251.999
insane that movie is crazy it is it is

1248.129 --> 1252.599
kind of in a way like insane it's kind

1251.999 --> 1256.6490000000001
of funny

1252.599 --> 1258.45
the music is is cool although things

1256.649 --> 1261.4189999999999
yeah it's old-fashioned I think things

1258.45 --> 1262.739
for my taste go on a little too long get

1261.419 --> 1266.909
a little to stretch out with so much

1262.739 --> 1269.909
effort in it's surreal but at the same

1266.909 --> 1277.1390000000001
time there is so much left is [ __ ] in

1269.909 --> 1279.3490000000002
there that's just like I feel with this

1277.139 --> 1282.09
movie like it's trying to manipulate me

1279.349 --> 1287.07
did anybody else ever get that from the

1282.09 --> 1290.879
movie like they're so bold stating Lee

1287.07 --> 1292.289
doing it's like when you really look at

1290.879 --> 1294.599
what these guys are doing they're like

1292.289 --> 1297.059
total [ __ ] and they even like admit

1294.599 --> 1300.96
it and they're in a mission from God and

1297.059 --> 1309.22
basically just performing crime

1300.96 --> 1310.69
it's just like what the [ __ ] and then it

1309.22 --> 1312.73
kind of camouflage it with it being

1310.69 --> 1315.46
funny and it is kind of funny I guess

1312.73 --> 1319.27
but still like I don't know I'm looking

1315.46 --> 1319.74
at her totally differently now it is

1319.27 --> 1334.69
weird

1319.74 --> 1338.02
oh yeah yeah and I insane crazy stuff

1334.69 --> 1343.54
the Carrie Fisher in her constantly

1338.02 --> 1345.01
blowing up the [ __ ] and then get the

1343.54 --> 1348.19
Blues Brothers just walking away like

1345.01 --> 1349.84
literally nothing happened just climbing

1348.19 --> 1353.65
out of the rubble that is freaking

1349.84 --> 1360.2099999999998
hilarious and totally insane I did very

1353.65 --> 1362.98
much appreciate that running joke yeah

1360.21 --> 1364.8700000000001
because they put so much effort in it

1362.98 --> 1369.18
that's the crazy thing it's like so much

1364.87 --> 1374.3999999999999
it's all practical it's all kind of real

1369.18 --> 1374.4
this is just a different era

1386.279 --> 1405.779
yeah this movie's old it's not got a

1399.879 --> 1405.779
copyright strike for that song hmm

1407.61 --> 1412.2299999999998
anyway so yeah watching some movies

1410.019 --> 1414.369
keeping it basic

1412.23 --> 1416.74
because yeah yeah as I predicted

1414.369 --> 1422.4599999999998
yesterday like the entire day I was just

1416.74 --> 1427.629
like and I I yeah I did get a headache

1422.46 --> 1429.94
thank God that that seems to be over so

1427.629 --> 1433.539
it did get a little worse but today I

1429.94 --> 1435.789
feel a lot better I had just had a lot

1433.539 --> 1439.899
of good sleep and stuff and didn't do

1435.789 --> 1442.24
too much and yeah I'm still very sniffy

1439.899 --> 1447.899
but other than that I don't know it

1442.24 --> 1447.8990000000001
feels good and getting urge for fruits

1454.97 --> 1465.8700000000001
hmm sorry to hear that Jeffrey Bell I

1462.2 --> 1468.02
hope that me basically talking about my

1465.87 --> 1472.02
state isn't like rubbing off on you

1468.02 --> 1474.53

1472.02 --> 1479.66
just stop talking about it you know I

1474.53 --> 1479.66
feel fine so are good enough

1500.91 --> 1507.44
all right yeah I did kind of forget to

1504.66 --> 1510.3000000000002
say hello to everyone

1507.44 --> 1514.52
so hello AGM cleary

1510.3 --> 1517.47
eco and playing an anchor avoiding each

1514.52 --> 1530.28
Steve righteous force drunken bullet for

1517.47 --> 1538.25
one one glass Shaw Tomoko Cleary early

1530.28 --> 1540.33

1538.25 --> 1547.22
have Lex and what

1540.33 --> 1547.22
alright okay guys

1559.86 --> 1562.4599999999998
yep

1568.97 --> 1573.92
Karin be good see ya

1584.16 --> 1595.65
hmm

1585.34 --> 1595.6499999999999
and Jose hello David read

1602.02 --> 1617.67
oh yeah well one way to do it

1614.08 --> 1623.8899999999999
the Jeffrey bill is to basically get a

1617.67 --> 1625.99
it can with water out there and big

1623.89 --> 1629.0500000000002
enough and just leave it out over the

1625.99 --> 1631.86
day and dust everything yeah components

1629.05 --> 1635.59
that are out of that are twirling down

1631.86 --> 1637.36
will fall into it even if the wind is

1635.59 --> 1639.4289999999999
blowing over it less like yeah

1637.36 --> 1641.4699999999998
eventually be careful that the water is

1639.429 --> 1644.23
doesn't all evaporate if it's really hot

1641.47 --> 1646.679
where you place it and then at the end

1644.23 --> 1652.71
of the day just test what's in there

1646.679 --> 1652.71
just take a sample of it and test it

1684.12 --> 1686.84
yeah

1694.46 --> 1697.1190000000001
right

1707.78 --> 1713.83
well [ __ ] you got to thing that sucks

1711.62 --> 1713.83
man

1718.149 --> 1723.9689999999998
yeah it's weird like I've had a lot of

1720.939 --> 1726.219
job problems and then you would think

1723.969 --> 1730.659
it's like a tooth but it's really it

1726.219 --> 1735.579
wasn't every time but one thing that can

1730.659 --> 1737.529
kind of help it's like a symptom yeah

1735.579 --> 1739.629
it's not really gonna help you get it

1737.529 --> 1743.349
away but it might be somewhat of relief

1739.629 --> 1749.849
it's just use clover clover powder or

1743.349 --> 1752.289
something or because it numbs topically

1749.849 --> 1755.259
so yeah if you have to like powder

1752.289 --> 1757.829
something yeah it will be absorbed by

1755.259 --> 1761.619
your gums there's also like oils with it

1757.829 --> 1764.709
that can kind of work on the short room

1761.619 --> 1766.779
and usually it just takes some time goes

1764.709 --> 1769.659
away unless it's like something is

1766.779 --> 1773.229
really eating away at your molars or

1769.659 --> 1775.72
whatever yeah you'll know this soon

1773.229 --> 1778.769
enough if that's the case

1775.72 --> 1778.769
[Music]

1796.849 --> 1800.73
that I should like a hen crowing out

1799.889 --> 1802.82
there like crazy

1800.73 --> 1805.3990000000001
[Music]

1802.82 --> 1808.1689999999999
yeah it's with this weather like when

1805.399 --> 1813.09
the Sun is this strong like Oh animals

1808.169 --> 1815.969
are pretty much accelerated there also

1813.09 --> 1821.1589999999999
because it's not too dry and they're

1815.969 --> 1823.5900000000001
near water because there's pretty much

1821.159 --> 1828.749
like every fur right next next to this

1823.59 --> 1831.9289999999999
house and they all love this weather and

1828.749 --> 1848.339
sit away except for the freakin

1831.929 --> 1851.029
chemtrails whatever they are that sorry

1848.339 --> 1854.249
not a head and a rooster

1851.029 --> 1857.369
yeah a roosters crowing no not the head

1854.249 --> 1862.08
is dead though right

1857.369 --> 1865.259
yep there are several roosters around

1862.08 --> 1867.059
here there's one like here down like

1865.259 --> 1872.059
within this building complex in the

1867.059 --> 1876.96
corner and there's one over there as

1872.059 --> 1880.32
well so there's plenty of of roosters

1876.96 --> 1883.08
crowing and I love it I'm totally fine

1880.32 --> 1884.849
with it it's funny because when I was

1883.08 --> 1886.4689999999998
young it used to kind of annoy me when

1884.849 --> 1890.1899999999998
that happened because I was always like

1886.469 --> 1893.339
being late being a knight how constantly

1890.19 --> 1895.2
extremely late if I could and then you

1893.339 --> 1896.609
kind of don't appreciate if they make a

1895.2 --> 1899.3990000000001
lot of noise when you try to get some

1896.609 --> 1904.7289999999998
sleep when the Sun goes up if you know

1899.399 --> 1904.7289999999998
what I mean but now I just love it

1905.54 --> 1908.67
[Music]

1920.15 --> 1928.169
yeah yeah you might have a good point

1923.73 --> 1930.9
Chris Matt and raw fresh tumeric there

1928.169 --> 1936.929
do happen to be like these tumeric

1930.9 --> 1939.69
roots littler roots for sale but yeah I

1936.929 --> 1947.3090000000002
might just just go out and try it see

1939.69 --> 1949.26
whatever I can do with it like at this

1947.309 --> 1951.27
point knowing what tumeric does in

1949.26 --> 1964.289
general that should be definitely worth

1951.27 --> 1966.84
it so yep so yeah I'm pretty much open

1964.289 --> 1967.169
to guests anyone wants to be part of the

1966.84 --> 1972.9289999999999
show

1967.169 --> 1975.8700000000001
ie what's this low flat soit

1972.929 --> 1979.19
accidentally costing called up the

1975.87 --> 1979.1899999999998
entire master beat yet

1982.04 --> 1988.809
oh wait that was last night right No

1990.21 --> 1995.74
nevermind anyway

1993.12 --> 1997.36
open for guests or if yeah you guys

1995.74 --> 2000.84
could basically start asking questions

1997.36 --> 2018.86
and make me delve into whatever subject

2000.84 --> 2018.86
you like yeah

2025.07 --> 2030.6699999999998
cats yeah lots of cats out here as well

2028.16 --> 2034.97
and I've seen some cats like bickering

2030.67 --> 2037.94
with with the birds or basically like

2034.97 --> 2039.95
just sitting around like ah what's going

2037.94 --> 2042.29
on what's going on in these birds like

2039.95 --> 2044.15
that get out of here cat nah make a lot

2042.29 --> 2046.28
of noise be very distracting the cats

2044.15 --> 2048.9500000000003
like what are you trying to distract me

2046.28 --> 2053.24
off birdies what's up what are you

2048.95 --> 2056.33
hiding yeah a lot of that going on down

2053.24 --> 2058.0099999999998
here because there's cats all over the

2056.33 --> 2064.73
place although mostly in this kind of

2058.01 --> 2072.7400000000002
heat they just like to hang I see the

2064.73 --> 2076.51
magpie found the water bowl because it

2072.74 --> 2076.5099999999998
seems to look a lot and more empty

2081.92 --> 2087.91
oh he didn't like the attention okay

2088.27 --> 2094.63
anyway it had obviously been take been

2091.85 --> 2094.63
taking a bath

2102.21 --> 2106.339
put bells in all cats No

2137.13 --> 2141.489
[Music]

2145.42 --> 2157.4900000000002
yes Jose he is aware that I do that and

2153.29 --> 2160.069
I once tried him to pretty much on the

2157.49 --> 2164.18
level approached him without yeah

2160.069 --> 2165.829
getting on his nerve and he's like

2164.18 --> 2169.2799999999997
literally at this point where he's

2165.829 --> 2171.4700000000003
staying out of it and he he's just

2169.28 --> 2175.2200000000003
focusing on what how he conceptualized

2171.47 --> 2183.02
things it's mostly based on the

2175.22 --> 2185.93
spiritual realm anyway and yeah he he's

2183.02 --> 2188.15
just being trying to be very analytic

2185.93 --> 2190.339
about it objectively because he doesn't

2188.15 --> 2197.96
like the subject really it makes him

2190.339 --> 2200.54
uncomfortable but he does know like kind

2197.96 --> 2204.29
of what I'm doing I do also talk about

2200.54 --> 2206.69
that to him like about the psychology

2204.29 --> 2208.25
part pretty much and he thinks I'm kind

2206.69 --> 2213.859
of like doing a good thing with it so

2208.25 --> 2216.88
that there's that at least but no he's

2213.859 --> 2216.88
not a flat earther

2219.94 --> 2223.139
[Music]

2232.37 --> 2238.0099999999998
yeah that's right over mu cool birds are

2234.99 --> 2242.66
always watching us and pretending not to

2238.01 --> 2242.6600000000003
but so do humans so

2271.88 --> 2278.75
well righteous force yeah

2275.72 --> 2280.7
Flat Earth does make the topic does make

2278.75 --> 2283.49
a certain group of people uncomfortable

2280.7 --> 2287.48
especially these specialists because

2283.49 --> 2292.25
almost in every specialist area there

2287.48 --> 2298.04
are like things built in with some kind

2292.25 --> 2300.26
of heliocentric original thinking type

2298.04 --> 2306.05
of angle to things it's almost in

2300.26 --> 2308.3300000000004
everything it's insane so he just does

2306.05 --> 2311.8100000000004
with that type of conceptualization of

2308.33 --> 2313.52
certain ethereal things and that's just

2311.81 --> 2317.12
a standard and all his colleagues do

2313.52 --> 2319.91
that and yeah to then just know it's all

2317.12 --> 2321.68
wrong because yeah good luck with that

2319.91 --> 2326.87
you know though

2321.68 --> 2329.6299999999997
so it's because that's what happens like

2326.87 --> 2331.64
the heliocentric way of thinking even

2329.63 --> 2336.2200000000003
though it is complete lies is just

2331.64 --> 2339.62
integrated in everything because people

2336.22 --> 2341.8399999999997
that were obsessed with that [ __ ] that

2339.62 --> 2343.7
systemizing way of thinking we're just

2341.84 --> 2349.3900000000003
putting all these references in

2343.7 --> 2353.24
everything like a cultural obsession and

2349.39 --> 2355.85
I used to do it myself even just in

2353.24 --> 2359.5099999999998
trying to metaphor eyes things describe

2355.85 --> 2362.3199999999997
things compare things with heliocentric

2359.51 --> 2369.73
concepts I used to do that myself

2362.32 --> 2369.73
decades ago constantly so I get that

2376.82 --> 2382.25
the whole heliocentric thinking is like

2379.37 --> 2384.41
a storytelling medium a cultural

2382.25 --> 2389.69
phenomena that is just based on a

2384.41 --> 2392.5099999999998
complete presuppositional lie but it is

2389.69 --> 2397.18
tinkerer tailored to the human psyche

2392.51 --> 2400.3700000000003
and it's just not really going away

2397.18 --> 2404.77
normally people want to keep it like a

2400.37 --> 2409.16
secret story maybe and eventually yeah

2404.77 --> 2411.86
it will absolutely forever have chances

2409.16 --> 2415.22
over and over again that it might be

2411.86 --> 2416.9
again adopted or the group of people may

2415.22 --> 2418.6099999999997
be tricked into believing it's all

2416.9 --> 2422.12
really good even though they were flat

2418.61 --> 2424.4300000000003
earthers for generations that could

2422.12 --> 2426.68
happen again even if we completely

2424.43 --> 2433.94
Declassified do not underestimate the

2426.68 --> 2436.79
power of this spell its tinkerer

2433.94 --> 2438.71
tailored for the human psyche so yeah

2436.79 --> 2443.71
thank you mind of god for the double

2438.71 --> 2443.71
super chata nation much appreciated

2473.67 --> 2476.4500000000003
right

2477.15 --> 2487.65
okay yeah yes Jose agreed that was

2485.11 --> 2487.65
ridiculous

2500.54 --> 2505.91
yeah in a way you could say as a

2502.82 --> 2507.5
youtuber the guy that did that and then

2505.91 --> 2511.49
even gonna name his name at this point

2507.5 --> 2515.0
he basically shot himself in the foot by

2511.49 --> 2516.9199999999996
doing that but yeah who knows maybe it

2515.0 --> 2520.22
was kind of like part it is part of a

2516.92 --> 2522.08
scheme he's setting up for some kind of

2520.22 --> 2524.33
long term series takedown maybe

2522.08 --> 2527.33
politically driven maybe agency driven

2524.33 --> 2529.64
whatever it could be we don't know yet

2527.33 --> 2532.46
or he'll just leave embarrassed but I

2529.64 --> 2534.94
kind of doubt it takes more to deter a

2532.46 --> 2534.94
baller

2541.4 --> 2549.7400000000002
right okay well that makes sense

2545.86 --> 2554.23
we'll see what happens and to be fair

2549.74 --> 2557.5099999999998
like I'm yeah of course it sucks for

2554.23 --> 2561.44
4-iron real media but other than that

2557.51 --> 2563.42
and like like can we please not talk

2561.44 --> 2566.09
about it anymore because like every time

2563.42 --> 2567.71
that guy's name comes up it's just

2566.09 --> 2570.71
giving him more attention

2567.71 --> 2573.89
it just doesn't deserve it at all

2570.71 --> 2576.73
like at all he's a total freaking actor

2573.89 --> 2579.98
she'll whatever he is maybe just

2576.73 --> 2583.7
corporate shield free enterprise or

2579.98 --> 2587.98
whatever he is he's as fake as [ __ ] his

2583.7 --> 2587.98
heart is not into it and he's an idiot

2591.34 --> 2598.01
so this enough about that I'd rather

2596.3 --> 2600.6200000000003
talk about Slick James was more

2598.01 --> 2603.8500000000004
interesting even though there's not a

2600.62 --> 2603.85
lot to talk about these days

2609.76 --> 2615.869
yep never treat indeed a bad actor

2613.09 --> 2615.869
that's a good one

2650.27 --> 2658.65
yeah who needs sleep James we can do for

2654.84 --> 2660.869
Slick James emulations ourselves because

2658.65 --> 2663.9300000000003
we know exactly what he says pretty much

2660.869 --> 2666.27
in response to everything so we don't

2663.93 --> 2668.99
need him anymore we can just emulate him

2666.27 --> 2668.99
if we wanted to

2686.22 --> 2691.1899999999996
yep now

2692.39 --> 2700.67
there's much more to an apple than that

2698.25 --> 2700.67
you think

2707.74 --> 2719.02
I just really like this Apple and I want

2714.43 --> 2722.9199999999996
to see if they're seeds in this hmm nope

2719.02 --> 2728.46
oh there are some beginnings of oh yeah

2722.92 --> 2728.46
there is one huh there you go see

2729.72 --> 2736.3999999999996
yuck

2732.5 --> 2742.05
don't eat those they're disgusting and

2736.4 --> 2745.17
filled with like cyanide or not deadly

2742.05 --> 2752.099
amounts but it's just not healthy don't

2745.17 --> 2761.52
eat apple seeds hmm I love that Apple

2752.099 --> 2765.78
it was delicious it feels good oh no

2761.52 --> 2769.79
Einstein doesn't have enough Oh Oh God

2765.78 --> 2773.7000000000003
by the way did you did any of you see

2769.79 --> 2778.079
Owen Benjamin my god that was so awesome

2773.7 --> 2780.5989999999997
he was on fire he blew my mind like

2778.079 --> 2785.48
totally with a certain joke that was

2780.599 --> 2790.05
just holy [ __ ] did he make that up

2785.48 --> 2791.67
that's just too incredible right so what

2790.05 --> 2793.5
he said eventually like he's been

2791.67 --> 2793.89
talking about Einstein how how he's an

2793.5 --> 2797.059
idiot

2793.89 --> 2802.17
yeah and he was he's just dumb as a rock

2797.059 --> 2806.5400000000004
Einstein so he also apparently Einstein

2802.17 --> 2810.0
married he married his cousin twice and

2806.54 --> 2812.22
like abandoned the child who then died

2810.0 --> 2814.98
and every like he's a terrible person

2812.22 --> 2818.64
but yeah he literally historically

2814.98 --> 2821.52
married his cousin and then abandoned

2818.64 --> 2824.75
her for another cousin and then

2821.52 --> 2829.049
apparently even like anyway it's giant

2824.75 --> 2835.41
incestuous mess it's just insane so what

2829.049 --> 2838.89
I own Benjamin says everybody knows yeah

2835.41 --> 2844.14
Einstein famous relativity equation you

2838.89 --> 2847.3489999999997
know e e equals MC square right so what

2844.14 --> 2851.339
he basically said is that e equals MC

2847.349 --> 2854.6600000000003
square stands for Einstein married

2851.339 --> 2854.66
cousin twice

2858.269 --> 2873.779
right how do you think that up that's

2866.14 --> 2873.779
just too uncanny incredible huh Wow

2876.089 --> 2883.049
because he did actually do that

2879.329 --> 2895.63
officially historically so what the hell

2883.049 --> 2899.859
you know yeah I don't know you can call

2895.63 --> 2904.4990000000003
me on it but if something is wizardry

2899.859 --> 2909.19
it's that it's like the holy [ __ ] no way

2904.499 --> 2911.6189999999997
the court they have secretly like even

2909.19 --> 2915.19
had figured that out themselves and they

2911.619 --> 2917.4700000000003
kept it as a joke cuz I wonder sometimes

2915.19 --> 2919.96
you know Einstein oh really did he

2917.47 --> 2921.7
really think that up or was he just

2919.96 --> 2923.95
handed some instructions and he just

2921.7 --> 2926.739
math [ __ ] his way through all of it

2923.95 --> 2929.1699999999996
all this stupid scribble [ __ ] everywhere

2926.739 --> 2931.569
I don't know I'm not a mathematician now

2929.17 --> 2932.92
there's gonna be people oh my god you're

2931.569 --> 2935.17
so stupid you don't even know

2932.92 --> 2938.349
trigonometry oh can you know for

2935.17 --> 2940.7200000000003
instance equations wrong well just look

2938.349 --> 2943.9
at the result okay just look at the guy

2940.72 --> 2947.7099999999996
and there was officially a giant

2943.9 --> 2951.9100000000003
petition of scientists that they

2947.71 --> 2956.19
officially won demanded to officially

2951.91 --> 2961.1189999999997
openly denounced him right so yeah

2956.19 --> 2963.569
Einstein was an idiot and a weirdo in a

2961.119 --> 2963.569
pervert

2964.85 --> 2969.15
and in that case yeah I wouldn't be

2967.2 --> 2971.0699999999997
surprised if we would just like handed

2969.15 --> 2972.6600000000003
his instructions like okay this is what

2971.07 --> 2974.2200000000003
you're going to roughly make of it yeah

2972.66 --> 2975.8999999999996
we don't really care how you're gonna

2974.22 --> 2978.99
[ __ ] your way through that with all

2975.9 --> 2985.2200000000003
the math math gibberish every blah

2978.99 --> 2988.8599999999997
we don't care figure it out I don't know

2985.22 --> 2992.97
but still yeah e equals MC squared

2988.86 --> 2998.58
Einstein married cousin twice that's

2992.97 --> 2999.9599999999996
just my god amazing if Owen came out it

2998.58 --> 3009.44
came up with that and I'm just perplexed

2999.96 --> 3013.9
like this is just amazing the theory of

3009.44 --> 3013.9
marrying your relatives right

3017.72 --> 3020.79
[Music]

3026.26 --> 3031.21
yeah gady ether yeah I understand did a

3029.71 --> 3031.84
lot of things and it didn't make a lot

3031.21 --> 3034.03
of sense

3031.84 --> 3035.77
he was just mostly throwing a wrench in

3034.03 --> 3038.1090000000004
the works of what people were working on

3035.77 --> 3040.33
at the time and that's why a giant

3038.109 --> 3043.54
amount of people the ninth denounced him

3040.33 --> 3045.67
officially with faces on the photograph

3043.54 --> 3048.21
and their names and like being pissed

3045.67 --> 3053.76
off at him thinking he's a dick

3048.21 --> 3053.76
because he was I'm pretty sure of it

3060.21 --> 3062.869
yeah

3065.95 --> 3075.9399999999996
but you know did he do that or was he

3070.569 --> 3079.48
just the face of freakin schemers that

3075.94 --> 3081.339
were just screwing around with science

3079.48 --> 3085.54
because they were like ordered to by

3081.339 --> 3088.66
their overlords by the big wealth could

3085.54 --> 3095.619
that be it like seriously this guy come

3088.66 --> 3100.3489999999997
on is he really like some amazing figure

3095.619 --> 3100.349
heads no he's a freaking weirdo

3103.01 --> 3109.67
he's like a scientist pop star of that

3107.48 --> 3112.4900000000002
age like they did the same [ __ ] to

3109.67 --> 3115.27
Einstein is what they're doing now with

3112.49 --> 3119.8399999999997
like pop stars that are just incompetent

3115.27 --> 3122.42
faces or something or just weirdos and

3119.84 --> 3124.34
and they just promoted with the huge

3122.42 --> 3130.4
amount of media attention and money well

3124.34 --> 3133.0
that's freaking Einstein okay although

3130.4 --> 3136.2400000000002
with a lot of math so it was like

3133.0 --> 3139.19
specifically aimed for the more science

3136.24 --> 3142.8689999999997
for the smarter community back then

3139.19 --> 3145.82
basically to throw a wrench in the works

3142.869 --> 3149.06
but did he all do that did he organized

3145.82 --> 3151.9100000000003
that I doubt it it was allowed to happen

3149.06 --> 3154.04
and he was just a figurehead executing

3151.91 --> 3158.35
it and covering it for it with math

3154.04 --> 3158.35
[ __ ] that's how I see it

3163.109 --> 3171.3489999999997
the boyband Einstein right yeah you're

3168.69 --> 3171.349
getting my point

3174.709 --> 3180.44
just a figurehead with a lot of blah

3182.73 --> 3190.26
yep I know anyway yeah it was it was a

3187.53 --> 3193.349
great joke and it's a funny subject also

3190.26 --> 3196.7400000000002
yeah of course in science every time

3193.349 --> 3200.369
like it kind of really pisses me off in

3196.74 --> 3203.8489999999997
a way no yeah

3200.369 --> 3206.369
from a non Flat Earth strategist war

3203.849 --> 3209.46
strategist as like pretty much a flat

3206.369 --> 3212.099
earth debate people think of themselves

3209.46 --> 3214.56
at this point I think sometimes but just

3212.099 --> 3216.42
from general ethics standpoint I find it

3214.56 --> 3218.7
so annoying that every time like bring

3216.42 --> 3221.64
out new which gravity are you talking

3218.7 --> 3224.91
about newtonian deranged alien it's like

3221.64 --> 3229.71
there is no Einstein in gravity he

3224.91 --> 3233.0099999999998
literally doesn't get involved with the

3229.71 --> 3238.29
presupposed cause of gravity he doesn't

3233.01 --> 3240.48
he's just explaining the model of like

3238.29 --> 3242.7599999999998
how it's coming to be it's just an

3240.48 --> 3244.73
ethereal backstory based on the

3242.76 --> 3248.6400000000003
conception of the warping of space

3244.73 --> 3251.069
thanks to gravity so it's presupposing

3248.64 --> 3254.3689999999997
gravity to warp space in order to

3251.069 --> 3257.609
explain how everything is shaped to be

3254.369 --> 3260.01
it's total [ __ ] it's not an

3257.609 --> 3262.7999999999997
explanation it's not a type of gravity

3260.01 --> 3265.4100000000003
it's just more [ __ ] story on top of

3262.8 --> 3269.8390000000004
it that doesn't actually completely fit

3265.41 --> 3272.8799999999997
it's literally puke on paper supposedly

3269.839 --> 3275.04
expanding on the theory and basically

3272.88 --> 3276.569
destroying it making everybody confused

3275.04 --> 3278.52
and then just start to think oh I know

3276.569 --> 3280.68
what gravity look it's a microphone

3278.52 --> 3283.92
dropping that's thanks to freakin

3280.68 --> 3287.6299999999997
Einstein and his [ __ ] this is

3283.92 --> 3289.92
literal dump he took on the

3287.63 --> 3293.7000000000003
conceptualization and the study of of

3289.92 --> 3296.369
this phenomena of the aberration of

3293.7 --> 3302.069
gravity basically by by adding more

3296.369 --> 3304.349
[ __ ] to it okay and it annoys the

3302.069 --> 3306.7799999999997
[ __ ] out of me every time there's a rich

3304.349 --> 3309.3
grow dinner dinner Einstein and I'm

3306.78 --> 3311.73
straining superceded know Einstein me

3309.3 --> 3313.71
and just took a giant [ __ ] on it and

3311.73 --> 3316.62
made it more confusing and didn't

3313.71 --> 3320.42
explain it at all it's not

3316.62 --> 3320.42
type of gravity is just more [ __ ]

3327.33 --> 3335.5
what did they do to the knowledge what

3333.04 --> 3339.0099999999998
did they do and they made a giant pile

3335.5 --> 3341.89
of crap out of it so we have to all

3339.01 --> 3345.03
figure it out for ourselves digging up

3341.89 --> 3348.22
our yeah basically doing intellectual

3345.03 --> 3350.38
archeology on all [ __ ] but we're lucky

3348.22 --> 3351.97
enough to be able to even find thanks to

3350.38 --> 3353.86
the Internet and people just file

3351.97 --> 3356.1099999999997
putting files on there with that data

3353.86 --> 3357.82
it's really lucky that we have it that

3356.11 --> 3360.7000000000003
we can't even dig in the past to

3357.82 --> 3365.71
recreate it because without that where

3360.7 --> 3367.71
would we begin you know we when it

3365.71 --> 3371.14
really basically comes down to

3367.71 --> 3374.56
unraveling all the [ __ ] that they put

3371.14 --> 3379.0499999999997
into the science every crap that they

3374.56 --> 3382.69
put onto it and then just continue

3379.05 --> 3388.4500000000003
building it where we were left off but

3382.69 --> 3389.65
without the [ __ ] right and well

3388.45 --> 3394.29
that's what I've been trying to do

3389.65 --> 3394.29
anyway that's my main focus really I I

3397.74 --> 3403.0
anyway

3399.39 --> 3409.5299999999997
that was big rant yeah I understand what

3403.0 --> 3409.53
a what dick pervy dick

3413.39 --> 3422.5
[Music]

3415.26 --> 3424.6000000000004
yeah thanks yeah yeah if you want you

3422.5 --> 3428.41
can repost the are Whitney and Einstein

3424.6 --> 3429.91
around anytime I stand firm with that

3428.41 --> 3434.0699999999997
and I also help

3429.91 --> 3436.54
I want to thank like Owen Benjamin

3434.07 --> 3439.36
personally to basically like reaffirm

3436.54 --> 3441.4
that because I've had issues with

3439.36 --> 3443.2000000000003
Einsteins work herd conflicts like in

3441.4 --> 3447.4900000000002
the far past but I would always think no

3443.2 --> 3449.6499999999996
he was just like a dreamer and then I

3447.49 --> 3452.74
started to understand yeah he might have

3449.65 --> 3457.12
been a dreamer with that but he wasn't

3452.74 --> 3461.7099999999996
really actively trying to fix it because

3457.12 --> 3463.63
I I get what's really what the signature

3461.71 --> 3465.43
of the growth of what he's doing no he's

3463.63 --> 3467.62
not trying to fix it he's just trying to

3465.43 --> 3471.04
put a story in there to distract

3467.62 --> 3472.93
everyone as a dreamer as a storytelling

3471.04 --> 3475.09
that's actively what he's doing and at

3472.93 --> 3479.91
the same time a misbehaving like a

3475.09 --> 3483.4
[ __ ] he's pretty much satanic

3479.91 --> 3486.18
like actively doing that kind of crazy

3483.4 --> 3488.65
[ __ ] like maybe not like mood

3486.18 --> 3493.66
sacrificing people that kind of crap not

3488.65 --> 3496.38
not that but just actively going against

3493.66 --> 3500.0099999999998
what you're supposed to do just being

3496.38 --> 3503.26
against God and I think he was a pretty

3500.01 --> 3506.13
outspoken atheist that really hated God

3503.26 --> 3508.7200000000003
as well so that that would make sense

3506.13 --> 3511.03
well it's just a stupid story teller

3508.72 --> 3513.58
yeah well look who's talking or win oh

3511.03 --> 3516.4900000000002
yeah it was just a stupid I haven't

3513.58 --> 3519.4
never had sex with my cousin thank God I

3516.49 --> 3524.2299999999996
don't even have female cousin and

3519.4 --> 3527.59
they're not my types and let's not get

3524.23 --> 3530.59
into that but you know I at least try to

3527.59 --> 3532.78
not make [ __ ] stories to confuse

3530.59 --> 3535.8
[ __ ] but actually to God try to give

3532.78 --> 3537.73
some framework in the development

3535.8 --> 3541.0600000000004
conceptualization framework to make

3537.73 --> 3543.79
progress actually tying it in to observe

3541.06 --> 3546.25
phenomena real things trying to get away

3543.79 --> 3550.45
the misconceptions and presuppositions

3546.25 --> 3552.73
ways of thinking very actively so yeah

3550.45 --> 3555.1
Einstein didn't do that at all he just

3552.73 --> 3558.96
created more presupposition [ __ ]

3555.1 --> 3560.83
that's literally what he did more

3558.96 --> 3562.57
presuppositional [ __ ] and

3560.83 --> 3566.7999999999997
everything's relative us all just

3562.57 --> 3568.59
confusing there is no center point there

3566.8 --> 3571.59
is no everything's relative

3568.59 --> 3571.59
yeah

3572.589 --> 3581.17
so yeah he's a piece of [ __ ] and he

3578.979 --> 3585.519
deserves it a historical dunce cap

3581.17 --> 3587.439
that's absolutely what he deserves and

3585.519 --> 3590.6189999999997
she'd probably be remembered as that as

3587.439 --> 3593.469
well just you know statue of Einstein

3590.619 --> 3595.839
put a dunce cap on there and just keep

3593.469 --> 3598.689
it that way and people figure it out

3595.839 --> 3601.599
they'll see like that guy looks like an

3598.689 --> 3605.769
idiot and then they're looking up I was

3601.599 --> 3609.4
like holy [ __ ] he did that he is an

3605.769 --> 3611.999
idiot doesn't know what the [ __ ] he's

3609.4 --> 3617.17
talking about he's just fantasizing [ __ ]

3611.999 --> 3619.479
right so yeah don't tear down statues

3617.17 --> 3621.88
I'm not for tearing down statues of

3619.479 --> 3625.0589999999997
people even if they weren't the perfect

3621.88 --> 3627.339
human examples of virtue in every

3625.059 --> 3631.119
conceivable way even though that seems

3627.339 --> 3632.799
to change constantly but yeah we in the

3631.119 --> 3637.119
case of Einstein maybe a modification

3632.799 --> 3639.009
would be proper and just put a dunce cap

3637.119 --> 3641.7090000000003
on that would fit perfectly with the

3639.009 --> 3644.89
hair and everything it it's almost like

3641.709 --> 3648.3089999999997
it was miss head was made for a dunce

3644.89 --> 3651.819
cap to put on just think about it just

3648.309 --> 3658.449
look at it look at his picture it was

3651.819 --> 3662.65
made for a statue to be able to fit a

3658.449 --> 3666.9990000000003
dunce cap on there that's he was made

3662.65 --> 3669.88
for a dunce cap okay so just say it's a

3666.999 --> 3672.279
creative solution to this situation and

3669.88 --> 3672.849
I think it's worth considering for the

3672.279 --> 3677.079
long run

3672.849 --> 3681.9100000000003
so yeah it's a good opportunity to round

3677.079 --> 3685.059
out the show again Einstein's head was

3681.91 --> 3687.7889999999998
specifically designed in order for

3685.059 --> 3690.759
modification in his statue to fit a

3687.789 --> 3693.039
dunce cap cap on there once people

3690.759 --> 3695.109
realize what an incredible idiot he

3693.039 --> 3697.809
really is so with that I'm gonna run out

3695.109 --> 3699.699
the show thanks everyone in chat for

3697.809 --> 3702.849

3722.26 --> 3726.4300000000003
at this point and yeah I will be back

3725.44 --> 3733.66
tomorrow with Flat Earth

3726.43 --> 3735.43
early-bird number 202 symmetry and maybe

3733.66 --> 3737.0499999999997
I'll be a little on the base I'm not

3735.43 --> 3740.98
sure yet how active I'm gonna be there

3737.05 --> 3745.11
we'll see and yeah thanks everyone for

3740.98 --> 3750.16
being here until the next Flat Earth

3745.11 --> 3751.9500000000003
early-bird keep it flat and try to enjoy

3750.16 --> 3754.3199999999997
the weather as much as you can

3751.95 --> 3785.5989999999997
good evening
