paypal patron my GoFundMe and the super

67.32 --> 74.07
chats that will be much appreciated so

70.64 --> 76.22
today when I get in this kind of risky

74.07 --> 81.83999999999999
it's not as bad as it was yesterday

76.22 --> 86.429
it's very moist so yeah so what's going

81.84 --> 90.57000000000001
for some groceries it's just this like I

86.429 --> 92.94
would become wet but yeah and there's a

90.57 --> 97.03899999999999
lot of work going around leaf cleaner

92.94 --> 104.509
making a lot of noise and the workers

97.039 --> 104.509
still working on the road over there so

104.75 --> 110.83
yeah today I got green tea with me today

112.27 --> 119.6
that's it so let's see who it is in chat

117.01 --> 122.15
yeah sorry for being a little bit late a

119.6 --> 124.36999999999999
kind of last-minute went for groceries

122.15 --> 128.869
while Nathan just went live with the

124.37 --> 134.41
premiere from yesterday a bit the toe

128.869 --> 136.76

163.97 --> 166.33
sick

167.0 --> 170.53
all right read modes

171.16 --> 180.07999999999998
when each flatus cancers yeah I think I

175.79 --> 182.89
got you all know so yeah plenty of

180.08 --> 182.89000000000001
people in chat

188.89 --> 195.48999999999998
yeah sorry yeah guys I'm a little bit

191.38 --> 198.88
slow today because weird Lina yeah I

195.49 --> 200.83
didn't drink anything last night but

198.88 --> 203.79999999999998
stayed up pretty late and then for some

200.83 --> 206.65
weird reason I just woke up early and

203.8 --> 208.42000000000002
you couldn't sleep anymore but still

206.65 --> 213.88
looked tired so I don't know maybe

208.42 --> 221.79999999999998
that's a side effect like my rhythm is

213.88 --> 226.48
shifting back to the daytime so yeah

221.8 --> 229.09
maybe a little slow yesterday was an

226.48 --> 231.67
interesting day of course that's why I

229.09 --> 236.37
stayed up so late

231.67 --> 236.36999999999998
Oh Benjamin Stream

238.709 --> 250.159
I was very good of course I aired the

244.53 --> 254.4
night out for the second ever after show

250.159 --> 257.13
that I recorded yeah I hope you saw that

254.4 --> 262.8
I thought it was interesting it wasn't

257.13 --> 265.58
that long see oh yeah ranty plenty of

262.8 --> 265.58
activity again

271.96 --> 277.23999999999995
what else did I do what did I do

277.849 --> 280.74899999999997
hmm

298.13 --> 303.449
okay I'm having trouble remembering

301.38 --> 306.75
everything I did yesterday well I did

303.449 --> 315.41
play that game a lot I haven't found

306.75 --> 315.41
that midst of doing everything else see

321.99 --> 324.83
so that

325.11 --> 331.439
Yeah right after her home Benjamin ranty

329.36 --> 334.68
dad's just clean yeah

331.439 --> 338.189
that's it I guess well the streams that

334.68 --> 340.02
I saw were pretty good and also had some

338.189 --> 345.03000000000003
good moments at the debates

340.02 --> 354.77
I thought yesterday's hangout was pretty

345.03 --> 354.77
good overall Lowell menu

359.54 --> 364.53000000000003
why do you keep bringing that up and

361.919 --> 367.46
getting sick seriously why do you keep

364.53 --> 367.46
bringing that up

385.84 --> 391.38899999999995
yeah baits 60 RMC I'm pretty sure you're

389.71 --> 394.919
right about that that that would be a

391.389 --> 394.919
Dutch name

398.97 --> 406.53900000000004
Gideon said yeah maybe it's the first

401.62 --> 410.949
time you mention it but come on I did a

406.539 --> 412.69
hangout about it then a follow up and

410.949 --> 414.699
pretty much a follow up after that

412.69 --> 416.129
because everybody totally spiraled out

414.699 --> 421.08000000000004
of control

416.129 --> 425.58000000000004
yeah and I don't know why people why is

421.08 --> 425.58
yeah why do you even care that much

429.33 --> 435.25
anything is possible

430.96 --> 438.75899999999996
okay so you think that it's not silly

435.25 --> 441.039
yeah sorry I may be getting a bit it's

438.759 --> 449.08000000000004
just that I didn't expect the backlash

441.039 --> 455.08
from that to be so yeah so heavy just

449.08 --> 460.03
didn't expect that it so since then I'm

455.08 --> 461.5
kind of like tend to start out annoyed

460.03 --> 467.229
when people bring it up even though they

461.5 --> 469.96
don't me mean it the troll sorry it's

467.229 --> 471.81899999999996
just I tend to now not like it so much

469.96 --> 475.06
to bring up that subject because every

471.819 --> 476.65000000000003
time it's even mentioned again people

475.06 --> 481.15
just start spiraling out of control

476.65 --> 482.88899999999995
again but okay that's alright

481.15 --> 488.83
that was my misunderstanding getting

482.889 --> 489.699
sick alright yeah mother Salim thank you

488.83 --> 494.219
for my enemy

489.699 --> 497.56
yeah people remind me of what actually

494.219 --> 499.569
did transpire what was talked about and

497.56 --> 504.039
Owen Benjamin recently seems to be

499.569 --> 507.40000000000003
taking the orb theory that channel I

504.039 --> 508.06
brought it up once to the orb with the

507.4 --> 511.0
Rings

508.06 --> 514.34
it is disc thinking though you know it

511.0 --> 519.44
is still kind of a disc theory

514.34 --> 521.9100000000001
but yeah it's quite easy to basically

519.44 --> 525.08
transform the presuppositional

521.91 --> 529.17
orientation of the earth realm from that

525.08 --> 532.46
into a looping rectangular realm it's

529.17 --> 535.86
pretty much similar you know the Rings

532.46 --> 541.71
would make yeah it would not be again

535.86 --> 545.9
those circles all that it would simply

541.71 --> 549.39
be realm segments because of the

545.9 --> 553.26
celestial layout every realm is

549.39 --> 556.76
basically centered around a an equator

553.26 --> 560.13
where the Sun in that in that

556.76 --> 563.76
oscillation pattern from north to south

560.13 --> 566.16
is at its highest that's where our realm

563.76 --> 568.47
basically forms and there is viable land

566.16 --> 571.7099999999999
masses in life and then at the ant

568.47 --> 574.89
equator the exact opposite of that that

571.71 --> 579.33
is where is all the ice and it's where

574.89 --> 581.04
it's tough to move past that's how I've

579.33 --> 584.49
conceptualized it in the rectangular

581.04 --> 586.8299999999999
Luqman model so it is again it is kind

584.49 --> 591.99
of the same thing but it's oats the disc

586.83 --> 593.9100000000001
again because then you can imagine that

591.99 --> 597.15
you know certain things about the

593.91 --> 600.4499999999999
orientation and la blah blah but yeah

597.15 --> 605.93
it's a it's an interesting concept and I

600.45 --> 605.9300000000001
like that is at least digging in there

606.87 --> 610.32
frequency realms

610.8 --> 615.4
frequent if you're talking about

612.43 --> 617.38
different frequencies well then you're

615.4 --> 622.75
gonna go into interdimensional realms

617.38 --> 627.34
you know that that's something else now

622.75 --> 629.59
I'm pretty sure that the the Rings the

627.34 --> 631.3000000000001
concept of the Rings as is the

629.59 --> 633.58
rectangular looping model with different

631.3 --> 637.4799999999999
realms is all within spatial reality

633.58 --> 642.2800000000001
within physical reality then the the

637.48 --> 645.78
normal 3d realm as we experience it from

642.28 --> 645.78
within your consciousness in this body

646.14 --> 655.21
whatever is lie deeper through any in

650.47 --> 657.3100000000001
the higher dimensions yeah that's yeah

655.21 --> 660.25
you basically lose the standard

657.31 --> 661.66
physicality terminology and it's weird

660.25 --> 664.48
because our consciousness or very

661.66 --> 667.87
consciousness are anchored in being used

664.48 --> 671.47
to objects and material things to

667.87 --> 673.84
reflect upon so even as we would if we

671.47 --> 676.33
would enter the higher realms it would

673.84 --> 679.08
always at least start out reflecting

676.33 --> 685.36
upon our material experiences trying to

679.08 --> 687.97
somehow translate what it is there into

685.36 --> 692.23
our understanding because otherwise we

687.97 --> 695.5500000000001
just wouldn't get anything about the

692.23 --> 699.84
experience so that's what I think

695.55 --> 704.64
concerning in two dimension ality mmm

699.84 --> 704.64
it's kind of I think I've experienced it

716.769 --> 719.369
yeah

721.14 --> 726.799
[Music]

729.3 --> 742.6099999999999
[Music]

736.37 --> 743.18
flatus Kansas I don't see exactly what

742.61 --> 745.52
you mean

743.18 --> 748.2199999999999
as altitude increases relative density

745.52 --> 753.6999999999999
disequilibrium seems to lessen really

748.22 --> 753.7
based on what I don't think so

754.66 --> 764.6899999999999
no it doesn't not really no the relative

759.05 --> 769.16
density relation is always pretty much

764.69 --> 771.62
consistent the higher up the thinner the

769.16 --> 775.4
air is the less dense

771.62 --> 778.13
so gasses that would and lower at but at

775.4 --> 783.5
the bottom or very quickly will

778.13 --> 785.66
eventually decrease in speed because the

783.5 --> 791.33
other relation between the densities is

785.66 --> 795.53
is less extreme but no relative density

791.33 --> 798.38
itself doesn't really change also

795.53 --> 801.14
relative density equilibrium seems to

798.38 --> 804.65
lessen it wait is that actually what

801.14 --> 809.75
you're saying and what you mean this

804.65 --> 812.63
equilibrium if the equilibrium would

809.75 --> 815.29
lessen the over altitude really loopy

812.63 --> 815.29
things would happen

819.71 --> 827.3000000000001
that would mean that things with even

824.839 --> 832.6
less density then that atmosphere would

827.3 --> 835.9399999999999
shoot up accelerated extreme speeds and

832.6 --> 839.12
objects would fall unusually like they

835.94 --> 841.36
would like being thrown so I don't think

839.12 --> 841.36
so

865.85 --> 874.28
all right well flatus Kansas I I

871.12 --> 876.65
understand yeah I get it it is the

874.28 --> 878.3299999999999
concept the idea that is basically in

876.65 --> 882.4399999999999
been implanted to us through the

878.33 --> 885.98
heliocentric fanta system like is there

882.44 --> 889.9100000000001
a some point where suddenly yeah there

885.98 --> 891.89
you float that idea right but it's an

889.91 --> 894.92
idea it's a concept that's been placed

891.89 --> 896.72
into our minds then then we kind of tend

894.92 --> 899.36
to then long for because it seems

896.72 --> 901.85
interesting but there in reality there

899.36 --> 906.11
is no clue whatsoever that there is such

901.85 --> 911.0
region or that yeah that the relative

906.11 --> 915.11
density effect would be altered in its

911.0 --> 918.79
intensity there's no there's no

915.11 --> 918.79
indication of that even

923.54 --> 929.63
so yeah but in yeah anyway I've said it

927.32 --> 932.33
like what what could be out there who

929.63 --> 936.92
knows really but so far there's been no

932.33 --> 942.9100000000001
indication whatsoever that yeah that

936.92 --> 942.91
relative density changes over override

943.97 --> 947.369
[Music]

951.1 --> 954.149
[Music]

972.74 --> 975.46
hmm

992.89 --> 997.9
all right yeah hardly looking yeah a

995.65 --> 1000.09
pair review is all very interesting and

997.9 --> 1005.03
fine the problem is is that peer review

1000.09 --> 1009.0300000000001
is highly susceptible the politicization

1005.03 --> 1011.79
highly susceptible every time and

1009.03 --> 1015.9
there's just too many people with too

1011.79 --> 1020.28
many priorities to basically not know

1015.9 --> 1022.53
that at this point so peer review in

1020.28 --> 1025.26
times when there's not so much pressure

1022.53 --> 1028.11
on everyone yeah that actually kind of

1025.26 --> 1030.54
works but when everybody's all fighting

1028.11 --> 1034.26
to get around her to survive or to keep

1030.54 --> 1038.22
their reputation or or to fight for

1034.26 --> 1042.33
their beliefs yeah yeah politicization

1038.22 --> 1044.94
every chance there is and so peer review

1042.33 --> 1049.62
is completely worthless now in this

1044.94 --> 1051.3
stage everybody's basically got to make

1049.62 --> 1053.4599999999998
up their own minds it it doesn't work

1051.3 --> 1057.12
anymore to just trust on somebody saying

1053.46 --> 1061.89
yeah there's a ton of people that agree

1057.12 --> 1064.05
with me you know and that could people

1061.89 --> 1065.94
can even very easily say such thing kind

1064.05 --> 1067.74
of slightly out of context and just say

1065.94 --> 1071.22
yeah they agree with me but when you

1067.74 --> 1074.07
then actually look into the pair into

1071.22 --> 1076.17
the reviews the actual reviews the text

1074.07 --> 1079.97
that those people's wrote about it which

1076.17 --> 1083.13
would be huge task yeah it's no way

1079.97 --> 1085.26
anybody's gonna read like 10 hours of

1083.13 --> 1087.5100000000002
text from different people just to

1085.26 --> 1090.36
confirm some baller argument that he

1087.51 --> 1093.81
just slings out of his sleeve in a

1090.36 --> 1095.61
couple of seconds right and if you would

1093.81 --> 1101.1
you'd probably find out that all those

1095.61 --> 1103.86
people do not agree that it just seems

1101.1 --> 1105.57
like that on the surface because all

1103.86 --> 1107.9099999999999
those people have their own ideas and

1105.57 --> 1110.04
will have their own slight objections or

1107.91 --> 1113.13
other points they want to emphasize

1110.04 --> 1119.04
about the whole peer review situation or

1113.13 --> 1123.5900000000001
have criticism you know so yeah peer

1119.04 --> 1123.59
review is completely useless now

1130.99 --> 1136.58
quotations could be useful because then

1133.79 --> 1139.3999999999999
you get things kind of you get the text

1136.58 --> 1146.24
at least but just mentioning peer review

1139.4 --> 1148.21
doesn't mean anything anymore I just

1146.24 --> 1153.46
said hardly looking quotations

1148.21 --> 1153.46
quotations work and literal references

1156.28 --> 1164.12
and and not cherry-picking by the way or

1160.82 --> 1166.25
quote mining if you're gonna quote

1164.12 --> 1169.79
something or somebody you're gonna have

1166.25 --> 1171.2
to have the source so that everybody can

1169.79 --> 1174.98
read the whole thing not just one

1171.2 --> 1178.76
sentence that you want them to read that

1174.98 --> 1181.21
is worth a lot more but it has to be

1178.76 --> 1181.21
source

1185.34 --> 1191.809
yeah I know Hartley looking that's

1188.159 --> 1194.759
really nice but the thing is just saying

1191.809 --> 1197.539
peer-review doesn't mean anything you

1194.759 --> 1197.539
gotta be specific

1216.76 --> 1222.76
so hardly looking are you gonna ask that

1219.37 --> 1226.809
one more time because then you're been I

1222.76 --> 1229.03
just gave you an elaborate answer what

1226.809 --> 1232.54
is the alternative to peer-review it is

1229.03 --> 1235.9189999999999
concise quotation without quote mining

1232.54 --> 1240.61
or cherry-picking giving the source

1235.919 --> 1245.5490000000002
singular sources with quotes available

1240.61 --> 1249.1
for those you argue with to look into

1245.549 --> 1251.6399999999999
that is the alternative to peer review

1249.1 --> 1251.6399999999999
okay

1264.92 --> 1274.6200000000001
right so are you if you are you gonna

1268.35 --> 1276.4199999999998
say it one more time I dare you say it

1274.62 --> 1280.9799999999998
one more time ask the question one more

1276.42 --> 1290.04
time hardly looking come on you know you

1280.98 --> 1291.63
want to you got it all copied up you

1290.04 --> 1293.8999999999999
want to paste it and enter you know you

1291.63 --> 1293.9
do

1302.73 --> 1309.24
all right I think you need to listen to

1306.69 --> 1311.22
when people tell you things and stop

1309.24 --> 1313.2
copy pasting the same question four

1311.22 --> 1315.47
times when they are already being

1313.2 --> 1315.47
answered

1318.71 --> 1325.6100000000001
it's not about disagreeing it's about

1321.36 --> 1325.61
ignoring when you get an answer

1331.84 --> 1337.6399999999999
[Music]

1345.54 --> 1351.0
right because I don't mind if people

1348.45 --> 1354.15
disagree with me even about big things

1351.0 --> 1357.66
even about silly things what I do mind

1354.15 --> 1359.93
is when they don't listen when their

1357.66 --> 1367.46
disagreements prevents them from

1359.93 --> 1371.3100000000002
listening to answers or compels them to

1367.46 --> 1374.13
insert their things when people are

1371.31 --> 1377.85
still explaining that kind of thing

1374.13 --> 1380.0400000000002
it's terrible habit and even

1377.85 --> 1382.02
flat-earthers the the better ones even

1380.04 --> 1386.6399999999999
do have that terrible habit as well but

1382.02 --> 1388.59
the problem is we literally know every

1386.64 --> 1391.65
step the ballers are gonna say and how

1388.59 --> 1394.74
they do it in detail like it's not gonna

1391.65 --> 1398.3100000000002
take too long before eventually we could

1394.74 --> 1400.16
parallel talk word-for-word everything

1398.31 --> 1404.1
they're gonna say almost let literally

1400.16 --> 1406.92
because it's the same [ __ ] exactly the

1404.1 --> 1409.02
same [ __ ] over and over again well

1406.92 --> 1413.0700000000002
ballers can do that to us because we

1409.02 --> 1416.55
change we are figuring it out we adapt

1413.07 --> 1419.7
we change the angles of approach to the

1416.55 --> 1423.2
situation we drop ideas we figure out

1419.7 --> 1426.69
new ones you can't do that with us you

1423.2 --> 1429.81
can just interrupt us so you don't get

1426.69 --> 1433.8600000000001
to hear where we're at how we actually

1429.81 --> 1436.53
see it that's the difference but it's

1433.86 --> 1439.35
still annoying because if people don't

1436.53 --> 1442.59
realize that about flatters I love about

1439.35 --> 1445.05
people like Nathan for example then yeah

1442.59 --> 1447.9299999999998
it just seems like he is rumbling people

1445.05 --> 1452.24
but he's really not not really because

1447.93 --> 1457.47
he really literally knows knows by heart

1452.24 --> 1458.13
it's like he works at a at a lunatic

1457.47 --> 1460.74
asylum

1458.13 --> 1462.96
almost literally now and it's just the

1460.74 --> 1468.21
same people every time and it's just

1462.96 --> 1471.33
there yeah yeah and while he's teaching

1468.21 --> 1473.1000000000001
the audience but he just knows every

1471.33 --> 1475.86
single freaking thing they're gonna do

1473.1 --> 1479.6799999999998
just it's just a fact

1475.86 --> 1482.11
you can't compare it to the other side

1479.68 --> 1484.21
and how they act towards flat earthers

1482.11 --> 1486.9399999999998
and even though flat earthers can be

1484.21 --> 1491.56
quite Savannah and trollish and just not

1486.94 --> 1493.54
listen either like are just hostile and

1491.56 --> 1495.6399999999999
that's really bad behavior I don't

1493.54 --> 1498.46
really condone that but everybody has

1495.64 --> 1499.93
their there yeah they're there moments

1498.46 --> 1501.73
and their needs for this kind of thing

1499.93 --> 1504.73
sometimes to vent frustration and all

1501.73 --> 1508.57
that but it's not good it's not

1504.73 --> 1514.27
something people that we should

1508.57 --> 1519.22
encourage you know but yeah you still

1514.27 --> 1521.8899999999999
can't put it on the same level yeah

1519.22 --> 1525.64
Nathan Oakley Nathan oh please 90 80

1521.89 --> 1529.8400000000001
subscribe to him great channel Nathan is

1525.64 --> 1531.93
pretty much the one that's pushed me

1529.84 --> 1535.74
into going online

1531.93 --> 1537.88
well well going in The Daily Show

1535.74 --> 1542.56
because I've been part of the Flat Earth

1537.88 --> 1545.3500000000001
debates before that and he really well

1542.56 --> 1548.56
helped me it's a great it's been a great

1545.35 --> 1551.23
environment for me to learn a lot it's

1548.56 --> 1557.5
great better than that my school was

1551.23 --> 1559.24
than any school that I've been to no so

1557.5 --> 1562.24
I thank him a lot he's been very helpful

1559.24 --> 1564.49
we've had some friction and as well and

1562.24 --> 1567.96
misunderstandings quite a few over the

1564.49 --> 1572.65
years but yeah Nathan Oakley is ace and

1567.96 --> 1576.31
I think that he is widely misunderstood

1572.65 --> 1580.48
you know the his his sharp tongue the

1576.31 --> 1582.73
attitude is really appreciate is not

1580.48 --> 1584.56
really appreciated for what it is I

1582.73 --> 1589.02
think by most people that just don't get

1584.56 --> 1592.09
it they don't appreciate the need

1589.02 --> 1594.4
because there's a lot of people that

1592.09 --> 1596.9199999999998
feel just like that that are just sick

1594.4 --> 1598.8400000000001
of really dumb people saying the same

1596.92 --> 1601.1200000000001
[ __ ] over and over again and really not

1598.84 --> 1602.9499999999998
getting it people get really sick of

1601.12 --> 1604.78
that but they can't really show it

1602.95 --> 1607.3990000000001
because you got a deal with the people

1604.78 --> 1611.749
around you you know

1607.399 --> 1615.139
work or family wherever and it's just a

1611.749 --> 1617.929
relief for people that have that [ __ ]

1615.139 --> 1620.809
inside to see somebody actually put it

1617.929 --> 1622.999
there it's just like yeah it's it's a

1620.809 --> 1626.32
bit like that big bear effect with Owen

1622.999 --> 1630.229
Benjamin with slightly different type of

1626.32 --> 1634.9089999999999
group that has a similar effect but it's

1630.229 --> 1637.3690000000001
just there's a need for this but it's

1634.909 --> 1640.8790000000001
not a lot of people it's not the

1637.369 --> 1642.799
majority you know common folk are just

1640.879 --> 1648.9189999999999
gonna think oh that's just a really mean

1642.799 --> 1654.71
guy you know but I think Nathan oakley's

1648.919 --> 1656.95
ace and he's very principled and I like

1654.71 --> 1656.95
that

1663.86 --> 1670.309
yeah yeah Nathan is making more money

1667.94 --> 1673.3500000000001
getting more members I know

1670.309 --> 1675.539
yeah I'm bit jealous but yeah I can't do

1673.35 --> 1678.99
that because for that I'd need what is

1675.539 --> 1681.24
it ten thousand subscribers so yeah okay

1678.99 --> 1683.789
well you you know subscribe to my

1681.24 --> 1687.33
channel I ask it every single day at

1683.789 --> 1690.779
least twice we're getting it and at the

1687.33 --> 1695.9399999999998
end of the show but yeah it's now at one

1690.779 --> 1699.24
point six 4k so yeah just that's gonna

1695.94 --> 1703.88
take at least 10 more years you know at

1699.24 --> 1707.25
this pace so yeah membership is not in

1703.88 --> 1711.5390000000002
for me it's not for me apparently I have

1707.25 --> 1714.21
not been designated for that but hey if

1711.539 --> 1717.299
you want to kind of help me in a similar

1714.21 --> 1719.6390000000001
way then well become part of my patreon

1717.299 --> 1722.73
it is kind of similar to membership you

1719.639 --> 1725.4289999999999
complete can completely set the amount

1722.73 --> 1728.73
yourself and regulated it's completely

1725.429 --> 1732.3600000000001
independent if you want and by the way

1728.73 --> 1735.8990000000001
somebody did actually add to my patreon

1732.36 --> 1740.639
it was Aaron I wonder if it was Aaron

1735.899 --> 1742.83
Armstrong not sure but hey if it wasn't

1740.639 --> 1747.32
done thank you man we had a lot of

1742.83 --> 1749.82
friction in the past you know he's a

1747.32 --> 1753.6589999999999
he's I guess he's not a really an easy

1749.82 --> 1756.269
guy or in with me I don't know what it

1753.659 --> 1758.94
is but at least he see he really does

1756.269 --> 1760.919
support me just to be with a bit of a

1758.94 --> 1764.3600000000001
hassle sometimes I guess but thank you

1760.919 --> 1768.75
for supporting me over patreon and

1764.36 --> 1773.639
anybody else that wants to help can also

1768.75 --> 1776.37
do that you know but yeah whatever

1773.639 --> 1778.83
Nathan is getting he deserves it he puts

1776.37 --> 1781.11
in so much work he has put in so much

1778.83 --> 1787.019
work for years now

1781.11 --> 1789.84
deserves it and in his style I think

1787.019 --> 1793.35
he's really professional you know he's

1789.84 --> 1795.84
more professional than I am even though

1793.35 --> 1798.629
I think that I have become more

1795.84 --> 1802.7099999999998
professional than I have been like for

1798.629 --> 1804.6589999999999
example a year ago but yeah that's I am

1802.71 --> 1811.3500000000001
taking this all pretty serious it's just

1804.659 --> 1813.419
not easy to step away also like I just

1811.35 --> 1816.539
really want to be myself as much as

1813.419 --> 1819.659
possible but also it is a matter of

1816.539 --> 1822.35
figuring out like what what the world is

1819.659 --> 1828.3300000000002
really like how everybody is really like

1822.35 --> 1832.139
from an internet angle that is so you

1828.33 --> 1835.799
got to adapt and I think I'm I'm doing

1832.139 --> 1839.1899999999998
pretty pretty well at this moment it's

1835.799 --> 1841.889
all about how do you deal with the tough

1839.19 --> 1845.909
situations how do you deal when

1841.889 --> 1848.609
everybody's rowdy what do you do and how

1845.909 --> 1850.8300000000002
do you utilize the good moments in the

1848.609 --> 1853.139
best way possible how do you make sure

1850.83 --> 1857.6899999999998
that your inspiration doesn't fall flat

1853.139 --> 1861.6589999999999
when it does arrive those things are all

1857.69 --> 1869.539
what really matters and the discipline

1861.659 --> 1875.3690000000001
and persistence in the neck are really

1869.539 --> 1878.6589999999999
an act are such an actor that our

1875.369 --> 1878.6589999999999
darkest actor

1878.76 --> 1887.34
right all right Oh Fionna James yeah it

1886.35 --> 1891.87
is an act

1887.34 --> 1895.1399999999999
it's a parental Act it's an action it's

1891.87 --> 1898.02
a certain attitude it's something that

1895.14 --> 1901.65
you learned and it works you know

1898.02 --> 1904.3799999999999
teachers especially teachers of off

1901.65 --> 1908.0400000000002
children say around 10:00 and all that

1904.38 --> 1910.95
with yet young teenagers they are actors

1908.04 --> 1915.54
as well they have to parents have to be

1910.95 --> 1917.0
actors because if they don't then yeah

1915.54 --> 1921.059
the kids are gonna go out of control

1917.0 --> 1928.04
they have to take control and for that

1921.059 --> 1928.04
you have to put on an act that's natural

1928.13 --> 1932.5700000000002
that's social

1935.32 --> 1944.0
but hey Nathan is not literally a figure

1940.94 --> 1946.009
as in a fake figure and an act like

1944.0 --> 1948.649
somebody that's a character in a movie

1946.009 --> 1950.6
he's not like that at all no yeah he

1948.649 --> 1952.7299999999998
puts on the act when he's strict and all

1950.6 --> 1955.6689999999999
that and he's whipping stupid ballers

1952.73 --> 1958.85
that are masochists that kind of thing

1955.669 --> 1961.159
are really dumb yeah he puts on an act

1958.85 --> 1962.7199999999998
but besides that it also has a lot of

1961.159 --> 1967.94
calm omens and he's just naturally

1962.72 --> 1970.519
that's the way he is you know I've met

1967.94 --> 1974.1200000000001
him in person over at the flat earth

1970.519 --> 1975.95
Amsterdam conference not being filmed

1974.12 --> 1979.039
and that's just the way he is it's just

1975.95 --> 1981.6100000000001
a very laid-back chill guy very

1979.039 --> 1981.61
easygoing

1985.91 --> 2002.1000000000001
but yeah but ballers piss him off that's

1991.67 --> 2005.1000000000001
very easy to know yeah oh god don't

2002.1 --> 2005.1
yuck

2018.0 --> 2023.21
please don't go old dumpster pumping on

2020.31 --> 2023.21
me and check

2036.68 --> 2045.3700000000001
Wow what the hell is up with you Ivan

2040.45 --> 2045.3700000000001
varying the [ __ ]

2051.21 --> 2056.579
I am NOT even gonna ban that because

2054.179 --> 2058.529
that's apparently what your we're hoping

2056.579 --> 2064.46
for but it's just ridiculous that you'd

2058.529 --> 2067.309
go there it's just sick man are you like

2064.46 --> 2078.859
changing antidepressants or something

2067.309 --> 2078.8590000000004
because that's just crazy never mind

2083.69 --> 2087.849
but that was crazy what he said right

2108.52 --> 2111.67
[Music]

2116.26 --> 2127.78
all right I see yeah well if he wants to

2125.619 --> 2134.44
really post a link you can just do that

2127.78 --> 2138.01
and space between the the pretext as it

2134.44 --> 2141.07
were to prevent it from being recognized

2138.01 --> 2144.73
as a link and therefore not not be able

2141.07 --> 2148.119
to post it if you really wanted to don't

2144.73 --> 2158.26
yeah but I I overlooked it I was too

2148.119 --> 2161.619
busy talking at the time you know look

2158.26 --> 2162.8500000000004
if if I'm like talking for a few minutes

2161.619 --> 2166.54
and you're trying to get my attention

2162.85 --> 2168.85
and I completely don't pay attention

2166.54 --> 2170.83
please don't gamma out on me okay I get

2168.85 --> 2173.6189999999997
distracted sometimes especially when

2170.83 --> 2176.19
it's busy and chat and already said that

2173.619 --> 2179.52
I was a little bit slow today so come on

2176.19 --> 2179.52
take it easy

2194.05 --> 2197.239
[Music]

2214.54 --> 2222.02
yeah

2217.18 --> 2226.46
yeah that's a gym there HMS not allowed

2222.02 --> 2229.55

2229.55 --> 2236.36
it anymore you know I it's really nice

2232.85 --> 2241.42
and Corky and all but yeah when he goes

2236.36 --> 2241.42
like this it's no longer welcome there

2242.68 --> 2246.94
is such a thing as going too far

2253.62 --> 2256.739
[Music]

2290.38 --> 2301.87
all right yeah seems to be a lot of

2296.88 --> 2305.01
people recently just feeling the need to

2301.87 --> 2310.7799999999997
separate ties and and get all hate on me

2305.01 --> 2314.6200000000003
because AGM Mason be also because he

2310.78 --> 2317.77
just has this file hatred an obsession

2314.62 --> 2321.8199999999997
gamma obsession with Owen Benjamin for

2317.77 --> 2325.0
some reason and yeah I'm sick of it I

2321.82 --> 2327.46
told him stop it you know if you have

2325.0 --> 2329.05
that [ __ ] gotta take it somewhere else

2327.46 --> 2333.04
because I like him

2329.05 --> 2336.28
I'm not saying use the almighty whatever

2333.04 --> 2339.04
I just like him and I think I get him

2336.28 --> 2340.8700000000003
and I'd love to explain why but yeah if

2339.04 --> 2343.48
you can't stand it because you have this

2340.87 --> 2346.0899999999997
freaky obsession over something he said

2343.48 --> 2349.36
as a joke one time and you're gonna

2346.09 --> 2352.36
spiral and curse all about that yeah I

2349.36 --> 2355.6
don't want that in here you can go and

2352.36 --> 2356.4700000000003
do that [ __ ] somewhere else it's as

2355.6 --> 2359.7999999999997
simple as that

2356.47 --> 2362.9199999999996
and if he can't handle that and he

2359.8 --> 2365.01
starts now trolling me everywhere just

2362.92 --> 2368.14
like the other trolls just like the

2365.01 --> 2371.7700000000004
soccer controls that a tip you know it's

2368.14 --> 2375.5099999999998
like oh look he is now literally at all

2371.77 --> 2378.82
and he's like trying to I guess hurt me

2375.51 --> 2382.0600000000004
by showing he's a literal troll and he

2378.82 --> 2386.7400000000002
thinks that that hurts me that kind of

2382.06 --> 2391.81
shitty behavior it is really [ __ ] wife

2386.74 --> 2392.6499999999996
behavior it is very very gamma it's

2391.81 --> 2396.37
terrible

2392.65 --> 2398.4700000000003
and it doesn't hurt me it is just shame

2396.37 --> 2401.97
on you it's like what have you become

2398.47 --> 2401.97
are you seeing what you're doing

2402.45 --> 2410.02
wouldn't it have been wiser to just

2405.84 --> 2412.78
click delete instead of enter because

2410.02 --> 2414.67
I've had those moments and especially

2412.78 --> 2417.4
like two years ago with some people

2414.67 --> 2419.44
where I was just like it's really really

2417.4 --> 2423.2000000000003
pissed off who took it personal and

2419.44 --> 2425.9
sometimes I would fall to fall into it

2423.2 --> 2428.54
and things would always go bad so I just

2425.9 --> 2430.88
learned to like now now I'll just delete

2428.54 --> 2434.24
it I'll just keep it to myself because

2430.88 --> 2437.57
things can only get worse but I guess

2434.24 --> 2441.2
there are some people out here that they

2437.57 --> 2443.3900000000003
can't they just can't do it they have to

2441.2 --> 2447.71
do the end they can't do the leap they

2443.39 --> 2450.08
have to do and do it's very sad but the

2447.71 --> 2451.85
problem is if they can't control it

2450.08 --> 2454.49
if they can't can't have the discipline

2451.85 --> 2457.22
to deal with that here then I have to

2454.49 --> 2461.62
deal with it and the way I deal with it

2457.22 --> 2465.3799999999997
is giving warnings giving timeouts and

2461.62 --> 2466.0899999999997
then banning that's just the way it

2465.38 --> 2469.219
works

2466.09 --> 2469.219
[Music]

2471.88 --> 2476.7200000000003
[Music]

2474.28 --> 2479.03
so yeah I'm sorry to see these people

2476.72 --> 2485.99
that have followed my show for a long

2479.03 --> 2489.9500000000003
time go but I'm not that sorry because

2485.99 --> 2492.9199999999996
hey if they want to be like that that's

2489.95 --> 2496.46
their choice you know that kind of thing

2492.92 --> 2498.6800000000003
always happens it always happens you do

2496.46 --> 2501.109
things you meet new people and then some

2498.68 --> 2505.3999999999996
of those people turn into idiots

2501.109 --> 2508.43
or a total [ __ ] or backstabbers and

2505.4 --> 2511.339
then you drop them you don't start to

2508.43 --> 2515.1189999999997
then bite into them and focus on that

2511.339 --> 2522.71
because then you lose the rest so yeah

2515.119 --> 2524.569
that's what I'm doing and I hope there's

2522.71 --> 2527.0
not gonna be more people like that I

2524.569 --> 2529.369
don't I don't think so it's usually not

2527.0 --> 2532.16
that many you know they love to then say

2529.369 --> 2533.809
oh look everybody's go he hates everyone

2532.16 --> 2536.96
now that's what they then also do is

2533.809 --> 2539.2000000000003
like oh I've been exorcised because I

2536.96 --> 2544.309
was too stupid to handle myself

2539.2 --> 2547.0099999999998
you know so I'm gonna then all go with

2544.309 --> 2553.1600000000003
the show so now everybody hates her who

2547.01 --> 2555.7700000000004
like oh my god dude you know people can

2553.16 --> 2557.72
still hear you we still remember I still

2555.77 --> 2560.089
remember the things that you said that

2557.72 --> 2562.79
interactions we had the moments we had

2560.089 --> 2565.96
and then you do this like look at

2562.79 --> 2571.2799999999997
yourself man look at what you've done

2565.96 --> 2575.98
not to me to you that's you saying that

2571.28 --> 2580.51
there you went there not me that's sick

2575.98 --> 2585.88
okay that's the problem problem isn't me

2580.51 --> 2585.88
you're the one doing that not me

2591.45 --> 2597.73
hey and and I can make mistakes too you

2594.88 --> 2600.85
know can the interpret somebody wrongly

2597.73 --> 2604.92
and then you know a little bit of

2600.85 --> 2609.52
understanding would be nice pointed out

2604.92 --> 2611.7400000000002
not in a mean way but and then I'll be

2609.52 --> 2614.2599999999998
like oh [ __ ] wait I didn't read it right

2611.74 --> 2617.08
or sorry and you know I've said plenty

2614.26 --> 2618.3700000000003
of sorry on the show life when that kind

2617.08 --> 2622.6
of thing happens because I do make

2618.37 --> 2627.4
mistakes but if you can't handle that I

2622.6 --> 2629.98
might interpret something wrong and you

2627.4 --> 2632.65
then go shouting at me like oh look he's

2629.98 --> 2637.53
a bastard or what yeah what do you think

2632.65 --> 2637.53
you think that's normal to do that

2637.77 --> 2650.7599999999998
no that's nuts it's out of control so

2645.7 --> 2654.4199999999996
yeah you know difficult subjects can be

2650.76 --> 2659.8
tough on the nerves can unnerve people

2654.42 --> 2663.88
can make your toes grow so they get

2659.8 --> 2667.3
stepped on a lot easier but yeah a big

2663.88 --> 2670.54
part of awakening is learning to deal

2667.3 --> 2673.51
with the things you will wake into that

2670.54 --> 2678.07
is really the biggest part you know to

2673.51 --> 2679.7200000000003
an ignorant person awakening the concept

2678.07 --> 2682.75
oh you have more conscious more

2679.72 --> 2685.18
oversight it seems very appealing

2682.75 --> 2687.91
probably like oh I have control right

2685.18 --> 2691.69
it seems very appealing to me when I was

2687.91 --> 2696.19
young then when you actually figure out

2691.69 --> 2699.76
how things work yeah it's like yeah I've

2696.19 --> 2702.43
control but the world is a horrific

2699.76 --> 2707.7700000000004
place there's things here that I wish I

2702.43 --> 2710.7999999999997
never knew but now I can't unknow it and

2707.77 --> 2713.83
it's terrible it's just one side you

2710.8 --> 2716.61
know after you get if you get over it

2713.83 --> 2720.19
after you get over it then eventually

2716.61 --> 2723.25
some space forms and you also get to see

2720.19 --> 2725.4700000000003
more of the beauty but it awakening is

2723.25 --> 2728.71
not all peach you know it's not all

2725.47 --> 2733.319
peachy it's very tough it always is

2728.71 --> 2733.319
tough real awakening is always tough

2733.98 --> 2743.79
it's never easy you know you're really

2739.9 --> 2749.14
awakening when you're like oh [ __ ]

2743.79 --> 2752.859
and you feel like oh my god and not fear

2749.14 --> 2753.67
porn you know not like oh my god it's

2752.859 --> 2758.14
all doomed

2753.67 --> 2761.619
no but just like oh damn oh I have to

2758.14 --> 2763.8689999999997
really let this sink in that's then you

2761.619 --> 2766.15
know you are awakening to something that

2763.869 --> 2769.06
something real hits you and that you've

2766.15 --> 2772.48
your physiology and your instinct knows

2769.06 --> 2773.319
and that you're gonna now adapt to the

2772.48 --> 2781.81
new inside

2773.319 --> 2786.7599999999998
that's real awakening you know it's real

2781.81 --> 2789.819
when you feel the pressure but it only

2786.76 --> 2792.28
works if you actually wield it and you

2789.819 --> 2794.349
don't try to escape it and you don't go

2792.28 --> 2797.2000000000003
into fear porn because then it's all

2794.349 --> 2799.829
wasted and you just drop back back to

2797.2 --> 2799.8289999999997
where you were before

2804.83 --> 2807.83
anyway

2809.45 --> 2819.109

2968.66 --> 2974.8689999999997
all right yes Italian 1812 but that was

2972.77 --> 2979.43
hilarious yesterday over at Randy's I

2974.869 --> 2981.6800000000003
remember now the Globo was discussing

2979.43 --> 2984.5589999999997
like no there is no edge on the sphere

2981.68 --> 2990.3089999999997
like the horizon its optical it's like

2984.559 --> 2998.059
yeah yeah we know yeah we don't

2990.309 --> 3000.4900000000002
so that optical thing yeah is not it's

2998.059 --> 3004.809
not the narrative so that it's not our

3000.49 --> 3008.819
narrative but so what is your X so it

3004.809 --> 3013.96
you he basically tried to avoid visual

3008.819 --> 3017.2889999999998
interpretation overall in his in his

3013.96 --> 3019.42
view of why the earth was a globe and

3017.289 --> 3022.69
that's what it came down to only the

3019.42 --> 3024.46
celestial bodies he used as some kind of

3022.69 --> 3026.23
reference he would presuppose those

3024.46 --> 3033.64
being around the earth and all that

3026.23 --> 3039.809
I didn't basically oh thank you Martin

3033.64 --> 3039.8089999999997
