it pretty much went exactly as i

313.44 --> 318.56
predicted

315.36 --> 319.36
maybe even like 30 percent better than i

318.56 --> 323.44
had

319.36 --> 326.08000000000004
expected because

323.44 --> 326.56
yeah it was like the thing was under

326.08 --> 329.59999999999997
pressure

326.56 --> 332.639

thank you very much

332.88 --> 338.96

338.96 --> 345.12
after yesterday

341.44 --> 347.12
or after two days ago and then it gets

345.12 --> 349.28000000000003
all pressurized right

347.12 --> 350.32
but i still had problems with heat and

349.28 --> 353.59999999999997

way

373.72 --> 378.47900000000004
[Music]

375.199 --> 381.84000000000003

385.68 --> 389.759
already i don't know maybe i should

387.52 --> 389.75899999999996
check

392.84 --> 409.599
uh

395.28 --> 412.23999999999995
let's see

409.599 --> 415.28
what is your gofundme cars booked for

412.24 --> 415.28000000000003
friday oh awesome

417.52 --> 422.24
right so so you got it all together

419.599 --> 426.15999999999997
that's really that's awesome man

422.24 --> 426.16
so quick too good to hear

427.12 --> 434.0
hey here we go again good to see you

430.72 --> 439.68
this sunday the 30th

434.0 --> 439.68
of may 2021

440.16 --> 443.28000000000003
it's almost june

448.72 --> 453.59900000000005
oh what a luxury to just be able to

451.68 --> 459.599
drink tea just like that and not

453.599 --> 459.599
be like oh i might get hurt

462.84 --> 465.84
awesome

471.039 --> 479.84
you were very worried

480.0 --> 486.639
all right you mean that financially you

483.599 --> 490.0
were both kind of in it in a tight spot

486.639 --> 493.84000000000003
so it was like really problematic and

490.0 --> 493.84
yeah i can imagine

493.919 --> 499.919
you getting it together through the

495.68 --> 499.919
gofundme was quite a relief then

502.24 --> 506.08
i'm assuming a couple of things but

508.08 --> 511.52
anyone found a photo of the moon when

510.16 --> 515.839
it's invisible

511.52 --> 518.3199999999999
yeah yeah so crazy

515.839 --> 520.24
how long that guy just kept on going on

518.32 --> 524.24
and on about it

520.24 --> 526.399
and just first 10 minutes

524.24 --> 528.24
tried to claim it and then after that it

526.399 --> 531.279
was just

528.24 --> 534.5600000000001
just at homing just trying to crawl into

531.279 --> 536.16
nathan's position to kind of judge him

534.56 --> 539.4399999999999
over how he was putting

536.16 --> 542.7199999999999
claims off the globe at

539.44 --> 544.72
at his feet even though he had made the

542.72 --> 545.839
claims and he was now just trying to

544.72 --> 550.08
gaslight him

545.839 --> 551.6800000000001
himself to ignore that happened

550.08 --> 554.24
it's like a switch consciousness

551.68 --> 556.2399999999999
switcheroo they they make a claim

554.24 --> 558.24
then they forget about it then you hold

556.24 --> 559.279
them to that claim and then they project

558.24 --> 562.0
onto you

559.279 --> 563.92
that you are making that claim for them

562.0 --> 569.68
falsely

563.92 --> 571.92
it's quite a spectacle really

569.68 --> 572.959
but it's not the first time this is now

571.92 --> 575.1999999999999
a thing

572.959 --> 577.3599999999999
among the trenchers i've seen many of

575.2 --> 581.36
them do it

577.36 --> 581.36
but this guy was really tenacious with

588.839 --> 593.6800000000001
it

590.64 --> 595.12
right he did say he was gonna find one

593.68 --> 597.4399999999999
but then he just didn't bring it up

595.12 --> 597.44
again

597.92 --> 605.8389999999999
right hello adam meekin

601.92 --> 605.8389999999999
george sanford

615.41 --> 619.8389999999999
[Music]

616.839 --> 619.839
ah

623.68 --> 629.68
i can actually choke close my jaw again

627.92 --> 631.279
yeah now i'm doing better and i'm pretty

629.68 --> 633.279
sure that tomorrow it's going gonna be

631.279 --> 634.88
in a way that

633.279 --> 637.12
it'll probably feel like it never

634.88 --> 641.12
happened maybe just a little like echo

637.12 --> 641.12
soreness which is just like a

641.519 --> 644.5600000000001
like a mild push

644.959 --> 648.7199999999999
that's gonna be for another day but it's

647.36 --> 650.88
barely even noticeable

648.72 --> 652.0790000000001
yeah so i'm just very happy this [ __ ] is

650.88 --> 654.959
over again because

652.079 --> 654.959
seriously guys

656.399 --> 662.399
it does hurt every time it happens and

659.519 --> 662.399
i'm just like

662.88 --> 665.6
i deal with it

667.279 --> 669.8389999999999
yeah yeah

672.72 --> 676.0790000000001
yes adam meakin yeah yesterday show was

675.519 --> 679.12
good

676.079 --> 681.04
i wasn't on it though i was in chat and

679.12 --> 685.76
hey i had a lot of fun in chat

681.04 --> 689.12
i didn't watch it all the time because

685.76 --> 690.8
yeah i was really like it was going

689.12 --> 693.6
through the last thing it was

690.8 --> 695.04
getting annoyed it was very seriously it

693.6 --> 698.0
felt like my

695.04 --> 700.8389999999999
my mauler which is not literally the

698.0 --> 704.48
problem there's something underneath it

700.839 --> 706.48
right it felt like it was like displaced

704.48 --> 707.6
for like three millimeters or something

706.48 --> 710.8000000000001
which

707.6 --> 713.2
to my imaginary interpretation to my

710.8 --> 716.3199999999999
visualization because of the nerf

713.2 --> 717.519
nerves tend to amplify the apparent size

716.32 --> 719.36
to the consciousness

717.519 --> 720.8
it seemed like it was like a centimeter

719.36 --> 724.24
off it was crazy

720.8 --> 724.24
i was constantly like ah

725.12 --> 729.519
but it didn't hurt too much but it was

727.12 --> 730.0
like okay if i don't pay attention and

729.519 --> 732.8
try to

730.0 --> 733.6
close it and touch it oh man that's

732.8 --> 736.079
[ __ ]

733.6 --> 738.72
couldn't even toothbrush it so i was

736.079 --> 742.0
kind of in a hassle of that

738.72 --> 744.399
but that seems all over now

742.0 --> 745.6
very happy about it but i was still able

744.399 --> 749.44
to focus

745.6 --> 754.0
and just stick to chat i just

749.44 --> 754.0
needed some down time on my jaw

755.54 --> 761.04
[Music]

757.36 --> 761.76
well it was a great show it was really

761.04 --> 763.519
great

761.76 --> 764.959
and also part of the reason i didn't

763.519 --> 767.839
come on beside my jaw

764.959 --> 769.68
was that i didn't want to ruin it for

767.839 --> 772.72
you guys

769.68 --> 776.399
because i was definitely gonna be

772.72 --> 777.6
baldwin right because sometimes now i

776.399 --> 779.44
feel almost like

777.6 --> 781.6800000000001
now you guys are a little too

779.44 --> 784.0790000000001
overconfident about this

781.68 --> 787.8389999999999
like you've seen the last of it and i

784.079 --> 787.8389999999999
know so much more

790.0 --> 793.519
but i didn't want to spoil the the

791.92 --> 795.76
moment

793.519 --> 801.839
the mood and i would i think baldwin

795.76 --> 801.8389999999999
would definitely ruin kiwi's mood

804.24 --> 810.399
because like look at how rompus alone

807.36 --> 813.6800000000001
ruins his mood you know so if i'm gonna

810.399 --> 815.76
like sort of act like that yeah

813.68 --> 816.7199999999999
that's going to make him very pissed off

815.76 --> 820.0
i think sorry

816.72 --> 820.5600000000001
i kind of tend to avoid going baldwin

820.0 --> 823.36
when

820.56 --> 823.3599999999999
kiwi's around

834.48 --> 839.6
but yeah a great premiere and great ball

840.839 --> 844.5600000000001
busters

842.0 --> 844.56
good stuff

854.079 --> 871.8389999999999
let's see i'm really kind of dropping on

857.68 --> 871.8389999999999
the notes i couldn't do that

877.6 --> 883.44
all right man i'm almost almost through

880.639 --> 885.839
the entire book i'm gonna need a new

883.44 --> 885.839
book

887.04 --> 899.8389999999999
got like three pages left

899.92 --> 906.56
yes adam meakin but you know why

902.959 --> 910.7199999999999
right you you kind of know why how

906.56 --> 910.7199999999999
i because borrowing is a very

911.36 --> 914.5600000000001
very well figured out strategical

913.6 --> 918.8000000000001
position

914.56 --> 922.8
right it's serious it's it's wizardry

918.8 --> 925.04
but as ballwin

922.8 --> 926.0
if things heat up enough i am allowed to

925.04 --> 928.8
use personal

926.0 --> 930.079
weaknesses of somebody like i like

928.8 --> 932.399
ballers attempt to

930.079 --> 933.8389999999999
exploit personal weaknesses in the

932.399 --> 937.279
moment

933.839 --> 938.32
wielding them to maneuver the view on

937.279 --> 941.04
the entire thing

938.32 --> 942.9590000000001
towards some kind of point of view right

941.04 --> 945.92
they want to make the flat earth look

942.959 --> 950.2399999999999
out of control or whatever

945.92 --> 951.759
well i can do that too it's just that

950.24 --> 953.6
we would have to really have an

951.759 --> 955.519
understanding otherwise

953.6 --> 956.9590000000001
you might mistake me for actually

955.519 --> 960.079
violating the friendship

956.959 --> 964.0
right i'm not never going to like spoil

960.079 --> 967.4399999999999
like secrets or something i'm not stupid

964.0 --> 970.639
but i will play on like

967.44 --> 973.9200000000001
what capabilities and weak

970.639 --> 977.6800000000001
lesser strengths you have right even

973.92 --> 977.68
in as i am as balwin

978.56 --> 984.16
which with you adam is very difficult

981.279 --> 984.16
because you're tight

984.88 --> 988.0
but like with a lot of other guys it's

986.72 --> 990.32
really easy like i

988.0 --> 991.44
i could [ __ ] around with 10th man very

990.32 --> 994.399
easily

991.44 --> 998.24
kneel too but he would he would hold a

994.399 --> 998.24
grudge if i did that to him

998.8 --> 1002.16
right and i i probably deserve it so it

1001.839 --> 1005.1990000000001
is

1002.16 --> 1009.12
i have to be careful with baldwin but

1005.199 --> 1009.12
yeah he has a view on things

1009.6 --> 1017.44
and yeah he has solutions

1014.72 --> 1018.72
from a baller religion perspective the

1017.44 --> 1021.9200000000001
the only thing is

1018.72 --> 1024.72
yeah his his main

1021.92 --> 1025.6
influence i guess is trying to

1024.72 --> 1028.72
communicate

1025.6 --> 1029.1989999999998
from a baller perspective you have to

1028.72 --> 1033.6000000000001
admit

1029.199 --> 1036.0
mistakes that's essential i know that's

1033.6 --> 1037.12
super contradictive to the whole thing

1036.0 --> 1041.36
right but

1037.12 --> 1042.3999999999999
like you don't need to hold on to that

1041.36 --> 1044.6399999999999
anymore

1042.4 --> 1046.959
all you do is just like totally launch

1044.64 --> 1049.919
yourself into insanity

1046.959 --> 1051.28
you just need to learn and figure

1049.919 --> 1052.48
another way out and that's what

1051.28 --> 1056.0
baldwin's doing was

1052.48 --> 1058.16
he was always doing and then

1056.0 --> 1060.16
stopped engaging from that perspective

1058.16 --> 1062.48
way back because i figured out everybody

1060.16 --> 1065.1200000000001
i'm talking to about it is only there

1062.48 --> 1068.24
really to abuse it

1065.12 --> 1071.52
so what use is it right

1068.24 --> 1072.24
i i'm not gonna champion like evil mind

1071.52 --> 1075.679
control

1072.24 --> 1079.039
baller religion but i will

1075.679 --> 1080.4
champion it as in from a whole different

1079.039 --> 1084.24
perspective as i've

1080.4 --> 1086.4
forwarded it like it's a challenge it's

1084.24 --> 1088.96
an intellectual challenge it's a tr

1086.4 --> 1090.48
it could be a tradition an intellectual

1088.96 --> 1092.96
tradition

1090.48 --> 1094.96
to test your mind and in visualization

1092.96 --> 1097.1200000000001
and your physics and geometry knowledge

1094.96 --> 1099.679
and all these things

1097.12 --> 1100.1599999999999
right because it is a challenge to deal

1099.679 --> 1102.16
with it

1100.16 --> 1103.44
and in the beginning it's all like oh

1102.16 --> 1106.4
what is this

1103.44 --> 1107.6000000000001
it kind of forces you to research

1106.4 --> 1110.5590000000002
physics

1107.6 --> 1112.48
and the geometry in order to be able to

1110.559 --> 1114.0
understand what it what all the hassle

1112.48 --> 1116.88
is about

1114.0 --> 1118.559
right so it forces you to actually learn

1116.88 --> 1122.0
these things

1118.559 --> 1126.8799999999999
and that's why i think there is a

1122.0 --> 1131.36
definitely a place in world culture

1126.88 --> 1135.3600000000001
for a dual cosmogonical society the ball

1131.36 --> 1138.6399999999999
for those who are unable to escape

1135.36 --> 1141.9189999999999
the belief and will reify it and those

1138.64 --> 1145.3600000000001
that understand it for what it is and

1141.919 --> 1147.8400000000001
can use it to learn and to sharpen their

1145.36 --> 1147.84
skills

1148.84 --> 1151.84
right

1155.039 --> 1160.0
yeah but again yeah i wasn't really in

1158.64 --> 1165.8400000000001
the best of conditions

1160.0 --> 1165.84
to get on verbal verbally

1166.64 --> 1170.5590000000002
hey seeking star wars good to see you

1170.64 --> 1179.1200000000001
and also gary wiebenga i hope you are

1178.64 --> 1182.64
all

1179.12 --> 1182.6399999999999
enjoying nice weather

1189.039 --> 1194.799
hey oh [ __ ] i'm spotting the first

1192.72 --> 1196.4
lonely cloud oh there's a couple

1194.799 --> 1200.799
actually

1196.4 --> 1204.799
oops wow

1200.799 --> 1206.4
look at the weird creep muscular rays

1204.799 --> 1208.32
i don't know maybe the webcam is not

1206.4 --> 1212.3200000000002
picking it up i can like

1208.32 --> 1214.1589999999999
sense there is moist in the air

1212.32 --> 1216.799
there is definitely moist in the air

1214.159 --> 1221.2800000000002
because you can see it

1216.799 --> 1225.44
from the light moving past the clouds

1221.28 --> 1225.84
what a spectacle to my eyes at least but

1225.44 --> 1227.679
again

1225.84 --> 1231.4399999999998
i don't know if the webcam can pick it

1227.679 --> 1233.76
up my eyes are very good eyes

1231.44 --> 1235.919
very happy with the design that was

1233.76 --> 1239.12
provided for me

1235.919 --> 1243.5200000000002
through the generations

1239.12 --> 1249.84
thank god but yeah

1243.52 --> 1249.84
webcam is a little limited

1250.72 --> 1255.919
they're raining since yesterday and

1252.32 --> 1255.9189999999999
called ah amanda young

1257.6 --> 1263.84
so yeah

1269.679 --> 1274.24
back box fell off while driving it's all

1273.12 --> 1279.6
rotten

1274.24 --> 1279.6
including the cat what including the

1288.84 --> 1294.75
cats

1291.6 --> 1294.75
[Music]

1301.76 --> 1307.76
back box went down go boom boom

1305.84 --> 1310.1589999999999
oh that must have been the gas weighing

1307.76 --> 1310.1589999999999
it down

1310.559 --> 1314.1589999999999
right because as soon as that gas rolls

1313.6 --> 1317.6
out

1314.159 --> 1321.44
on the floor the back box is probably

1317.6 --> 1321.4399999999998
gonna start floating upwards again

1322.799 --> 1333.84
i'm just kidding that's ridiculous

1346.32 --> 1348.6399999999999
right

1351.52 --> 1355.44
well you know exhausts exhaust pipes and

1354.96 --> 1359.8400000000001
[ __ ]

1355.44 --> 1361.679
they typically get subjected to a lot of

1359.84 --> 1364.08
entropy

1361.679 --> 1365.76
right they're constantly getting heated

1364.08 --> 1366.8799999999999
and then cooling off again heated

1365.76 --> 1369.039
cooling off again

1366.88 --> 1370.4
while literally being directly exposed

1369.039 --> 1373.52
to just the open air

1370.4 --> 1376.48
and the moist in it right and then

1373.52 --> 1379.679
there's the salts

1376.48 --> 1381.28
all of that causes like rusting to to go

1379.679 --> 1384.3200000000002
very rapid

1381.28 --> 1384.72
so that's why yeah tailpipes always get

1384.32 --> 1389.84
it

1384.72 --> 1389.84
eventually they always rust up

1393.6 --> 1397.76
although i don't know man maybe there

1395.36 --> 1400.0
are like special tail pipes

1397.76 --> 1401.76
that have made of very unique material

1400.0 --> 1402.08
but that would be kind of expensive that

1401.76 --> 1406.4
would

1402.08 --> 1406.3999999999999
just make them impervious

1408.24 --> 1412.08
that that would probably be quite

1414.84 --> 1417.84
expensive

1422.919 --> 1427.279
9084 ford truck

1428.84 --> 1431.84
cool

1446.0 --> 1449.679
what do you mean

1451.52 --> 1455.679
what goes up must go down until gravity

1454.48 --> 1459.039
don't work

1455.679 --> 1463.44
well what goes up does actually go down

1459.039 --> 1468.0
right that's just the statement of fact

1463.44 --> 1472.0800000000002
and it's not because of gravity could be

1468.0 --> 1475.52
imagined to be of because of gravity

1472.08 --> 1479.36
it's just that if the world was a ball

1475.52 --> 1482.0
in an outer space then the what goes up

1479.36 --> 1487.84
must come down all that starts to get a

1482.0 --> 1487.84
little wonky

1498.84 --> 1501.84
hmm

1503.2 --> 1507.2
right nathan yeah that makes sense right

1506.48 --> 1509.279
because

1507.2 --> 1515.8400000000001
it's their money so you have to kind of

1509.279 --> 1515.84
like justify the purchase

1526.84 --> 1532.8799999999999
right

1529.6 --> 1535.6
that's a car talk i

1532.88 --> 1538.159
i don't know a lot about cars and i

1535.6 --> 1540.559
don't really care too much i appreciate

1538.159 --> 1540.5590000000002
cars

1541.039 --> 1544.72
they're just there's so much freaking

1543.44 --> 1547.3600000000001
complex engineering

1544.72 --> 1548.48
involved in even the the relatively

1547.36 --> 1556.08
basic cars that

1548.48 --> 1559.44
it just gives me a headache

1556.08 --> 1562.72
but i can halfway improvise

1559.44 --> 1562.72
to figure out a problem

1564.48 --> 1568.0
and besides in these days indeed there

1567.039 --> 1571.679
there's so much

1568.0 --> 1575.52
instructions about it and youtube

1571.679 --> 1578.159
googling you can basically

1575.52 --> 1579.9189999999999
just learn to be a car mechanic if you

1578.159 --> 1582.0800000000002
really wanted to

1579.919 --> 1584.0
and you wouldn't have to pay a dime for

1582.08 --> 1587.6789999999999
it unless you wanted to actually

1584.0 --> 1587.679
start physically doing things

1589.2 --> 1594.0
which is absolutely required to be

1591.279 --> 1594.0
become one

1595.76 --> 1602.48
right but you don't need to go through

1598.159 --> 1602.48
any education system to learn that

1606.08 --> 1609.36
space exists what goes up must go down

1608.48 --> 1612.24
is false

1609.36 --> 1614.559
right okay yeah then then that makes

1612.24 --> 1614.559
sense

1623.6 --> 1626.9599999999998
no desire to understand an exhaust

1625.919 --> 1629.8400000000001
system

1626.96 --> 1632.24
nathan nathan you don't know what you're

1629.84 --> 1632.24
missing

1632.48 --> 1638.799
because dude there's like people

1636.159 --> 1640.88
like exhaust matters a lot even for like

1638.799 --> 1644.6399999999999
the power of your engine

1640.88 --> 1649.5200000000002
and like you can adapt your exhaust

1644.64 --> 1649.5200000000002
especially like with scooters and [ __ ]

1649.6 --> 1653.76
motorcycles like the exhaust matters so

1652.72 --> 1657.2
much

1653.76 --> 1657.2
for many different things

1660.96 --> 1664.32
you can fine-tune it and [ __ ] but i've

1663.679 --> 1667.44
just

1664.32 --> 1668.08
seen people do that and i've kind of

1667.44 --> 1670.0
tried

1668.08 --> 1672.72
asked for advice like i back in the day

1670.0 --> 1676.72
had like this basic

1672.72 --> 1679.279
uh like motorized bike

1676.72 --> 1680.96
motor yeah how do you call that scooter

1679.279 --> 1682.96
i guess

1680.96 --> 1685.6000000000001
that was when i was 16 seriously like

1682.96 --> 1686.159
yeah i can do this and it was awesome it

1685.6 --> 1688.8799999999999
was like

1686.159 --> 1691.44
i did get a big kick out of it and it

1688.88 --> 1694.24
was all about like okay

1691.44 --> 1696.88
the standard exhaust how can you improve

1694.24 --> 1700.32
that and how can you keep it legal and

1696.88 --> 1700.64
etc like how do you yeah and you could

1700.32 --> 1705.6
like

1700.64 --> 1709.3600000000001
greatly improve just the capabilities

1705.6 --> 1711.84
based on on the gear setup

1709.36 --> 1714.399
if there was an option for that and the

1711.84 --> 1714.399
exhaust

1714.559 --> 1717.84
so that's that always stuck to me like

1717.2 --> 1720.3990000000001
exhaust

1717.84 --> 1722.559
can matter a lot for like just the

1720.399 --> 1726.1589999999999
quality of

1722.559 --> 1726.1589999999999
your engine output anyway

1730.32 --> 1733.76
just don't want to kill the kid with

1736.84 --> 1739.84
yeah

1755.2 --> 1759.42
right

1756.31 --> 1759.4199999999998
[Music]

1759.76 --> 1764.64
but also if you're worried about exhaust

1762.64 --> 1766.7990000000002
fumes and [ __ ]

1764.64 --> 1768.96
then just make sure your engine is

1766.799 --> 1772.559
properly fine-tuned

1768.96 --> 1775.039
because that matters a lot

1772.559 --> 1776.08
especially if it has like electronics

1775.039 --> 1778.0
involved

1776.08 --> 1780.6399999999999
like in the actual functioning of the

1778.0 --> 1784.0
engine matters a lot that it's all

1780.64 --> 1787.919
perfectly attuned because then

1784.0 --> 1787.919
the exhaust will be minimal

1788.159 --> 1795.0390000000002
and maybe the sound as well etc etc

1791.6 --> 1795.9189999999999
anyway again what another one of those

1795.039 --> 1798.24
things

1795.919 --> 1799.6000000000001
i know kind of how it works i just don't

1798.24 --> 1802.559
know how to do it i

1799.6 --> 1804.6399999999999
like stood around and watched car

1802.559 --> 1806.32
mechanics do their thing and then ask

1804.64 --> 1808.3990000000001
questions kind of like a

1806.32 --> 1810.559
pesky customer that just keeps on asking

1808.399 --> 1813.84
questions not to get in their way

1810.559 --> 1813.84
but because i'm curious

1816.64 --> 1820.7990000000002
because i did have a car and yeah it was

1819.76 --> 1824.96
like a

1820.799 --> 1826.1589999999999
citroen great car automatic with a big

1824.96 --> 1829.3600000000001
engine for a pretty

1826.159 --> 1831.7600000000002
small car but yeah

1829.36 --> 1833.4399999999998
it grew kind of old i've used it a lot

1831.76 --> 1835.279
and eventually it started to get all

1833.44 --> 1836.559
these problems and i just wanted to

1835.279 --> 1839.52
understand like what

1836.559 --> 1839.52
are the problems

1841.679 --> 1846.72
and eventually you get to go over almost

1844.559 --> 1848.799
every part

1846.72 --> 1851.84
of the car because at some point it's

1848.799 --> 1851.84
all going to break down

1852.32 --> 1855.84
it still was a great car it when i had

1854.96 --> 1860.08
to

1855.84 --> 1863.1999999999998
put it put it down was really dramatic

1860.08 --> 1863.6789999999999
for me because yeah yeah it was my first

1863.2 --> 1867.039
car

1863.679 --> 1867.039
inherited from my mother

1867.279 --> 1871.76
yeah i had yeah never mind i don't want

1870.159 --> 1874.3200000000002
to get into that again it's weird

1871.76 --> 1878.399
animism

1874.32 --> 1880.559
but it was functioning

1878.399 --> 1882.2399999999998
until yeah it didn't like break down and

1880.559 --> 1882.72
then like oh damn it i have to put it

1882.24 --> 1885.76
away

1882.72 --> 1889.519
because it's broken no it wasn't broken

1885.76 --> 1894.399
so yeah i feel really bad about it

1889.519 --> 1894.3990000000001
how that happened just was a good car

1895.039 --> 1897.44
anyway

1905.12 --> 1921.84
your truck has a name

1943.679 --> 1949.039
huh okay you want to get all complicated

1946.88 --> 1949.0390000000002
there

1953.279 --> 1957.36
you're talking about how particles are

1955.84 --> 1960.48
like imagined

1957.36 --> 1961.12
for the whole earth science groups to

1960.48 --> 1962.799
like go

1961.12 --> 1964.8799999999999
in and out of other dimensions like

1962.799 --> 1968.24
gravitons right

1964.88 --> 1971.6000000000001
well what that actually is

1968.24 --> 1974.48
is just trying to

1971.6 --> 1975.6789999999999
structurally reinforce certain types of

1974.48 --> 1979.039
modeling

1975.679 --> 1981.279
so it's it's all about particles

1979.039 --> 1982.799
right they're just trying to explain

1981.279 --> 1986.24
these phenomena that are

1982.799 --> 1989.6
literally being misinterpreted

1986.24 --> 1992.32
to suit the continuation of the m

1989.6 --> 1994.1589999999999
the particle model thinking so they just

1992.32 --> 1995.279
conjure these dimensions in order to

1994.159 --> 1997.679
explain how

1995.279 --> 1999.36
these seeming particles are thought to

1997.679 --> 2005.519
be particles

1999.36 --> 2008.7199999999998
come in and out of measurable reality

2005.519 --> 2010.72
but it's because obviously because

2008.72 --> 2019.84
things don't really do that

2010.72 --> 2019.84
it has to be something else

2030.84 --> 2035.6789999999999
hmm

2032.32 --> 2040.32
alter timeline no no no no when they do

2035.679 --> 2041.919
particle dimension [ __ ] that's

2040.32 --> 2043.279
different that's different from

2041.919 --> 2044.3200000000002
pseudo-harmony in four space

2043.279 --> 2047.679
pseudo-harmonious

2044.32 --> 2050.7999999999997
phase is so specific because it actually

2047.679 --> 2053.76
it doesn't conjure other spatial

2050.8 --> 2055.8390000000004
depths dimensions actual spatial

2053.76 --> 2059.44
dimensions it doesn't conjure that

2055.839 --> 2062.0
pseudo romanian four space right that's

2059.44 --> 2062.56
often conflated pseudo-ammonia in four

2062.0 --> 2064.72
space

2062.56 --> 2066.639
and then there's like the ten dimensions

2064.72 --> 2069.2799999999997
so

2066.639 --> 2071.359
right it's a totally two different

2069.28 --> 2075.28
incompatible things because pseudo-ramon

2071.359 --> 2079.44
in four space specifically

2075.28 --> 2083.52
appoints time as equal to

2079.44 --> 2087.679
a spatial dimension which is a broken

2083.52 --> 2089.7599999999998
system like that it isn't right

2087.679 --> 2090.7200000000003
like even virtually it kind of isn't so

2089.76 --> 2093.44
it's more like a

2090.72 --> 2096.1589999999997
thought experiment that's been taken way

2093.44 --> 2096.159
too serious

2096.32 --> 2103.28
so it's not even the same type of system

2100.4 --> 2105.44
because who knows virtually in my

2103.28 --> 2110.5600000000004
imagination multiple

2105.44 --> 2110.56
depths to physical reality yeah why not

2111.44 --> 2117.839
just more through

2119.92 --> 2124.96
it's not good to use as a foundation for

2122.88 --> 2126.32
evidence right especially if you can't

2124.96 --> 2128.56
measure it but

2126.32 --> 2129.599
i don't know multi-dimensional geometry

2128.56 --> 2133.359
elements could

2129.599 --> 2133.3590000000004
be interesting

2134.24 --> 2141.4399999999996
to basically explain certain patterns

2138.24 --> 2144.3199999999997
that are hard to pinpoint

2141.44 --> 2147.2000000000003
just thinking three-dimensional but yeah

2144.32 --> 2148.88
it gets all very complex and convoluted

2147.2 --> 2150.8799999999997
really when you go there

2148.88 --> 2152.48
so when it when it comes to science i

2150.88 --> 2159.839
would just stick to the

2152.48 --> 2159.839
the normal euclidean 3d world

2176.72 --> 2190.3199999999997
whoa man time has flown

2186.96 --> 2190.32
so any comments on that

2192.0 --> 2196.0
has anybody else figured that out yet

2194.48 --> 2199.52
the difference between the

2196.0 --> 2203.359
the ten dimensions of spatiality

2199.52 --> 2205.92
presumed through yeah astrophysics or

2203.359 --> 2209.119
whatever department that conjured it up

2205.92 --> 2212.32
theoretical physics

2209.119 --> 2214.48
or yeah between that and

2212.32 --> 2217.599
pseudo-romanian force base has anybody

2214.48 --> 2221.2
else realized that yet

2217.599 --> 2225.04
or is this new to you have you not cons

2221.2 --> 2226.7999999999997
considered it yet please let me know in

2225.04 --> 2229.839
chat

2226.8 --> 2229.8390000000004
those who are listening

2241.52 --> 2248.96
whoa the plane of

2244.56 --> 2253.04
inertia what what is that

2248.96 --> 2256.88
i like the the angle to your

2253.04 --> 2260.88
model approach though that

2256.88 --> 2262.079
matter actually starts out in the over

2260.88 --> 2265.359
dimension and then

2262.079 --> 2269.28
eventually gives off

2265.359 --> 2272.4
its effect from the higher dimensional

2269.28 --> 2275.52
like it does its thing which ends up

2272.4 --> 2279.44
at the physical 3d manifestation as

2275.52 --> 2279.44
how we perceive and measure it

2282.8 --> 2299.8390000000004
and crystallization again yes hey

2285.76 --> 2299.8390000000004
fractal thinking

2310.839 --> 2318.32
what what exactly do you mean

2313.92 --> 2318.32
seeking style water the plane of inertia

2325.68 --> 2331.2799999999997
look at look at that oh

2328.96 --> 2333.28
oh i can't talk about the 10 dimensions

2331.28 --> 2334.5600000000004
because i don't have enough papers and

2333.28 --> 2337.599
peer-review

2334.56 --> 2339.92
consensus opinion to back me

2337.599 --> 2341.599
am i not qualified in your priesthood

2339.92 --> 2344.88
peter

2341.599 --> 2346.8
yeah i am i definitely am and i think

2344.88 --> 2350.56
that the statements that i made are

2346.8 --> 2353.6800000000003
pretty correct unless you could

2350.56 --> 2355.2799999999997
literally point at how they were

2353.68 --> 2356.96
incorrect the assertion that

2355.28 --> 2358.5600000000004
pseudo-romanian force based in the

2356.96 --> 2361.52
actual spatial

2358.56 --> 2363.7599999999998
10 dimension idea that theory that

2361.52 --> 2365.92
they're not compatible

2363.76 --> 2367.28
yeah if you can tell me how i'm

2365.92 --> 2370.32
incorrect

2367.28 --> 2371.2000000000003
where there is actual mention of time as

2370.32 --> 2373.6800000000003
a dimension

2371.2 --> 2374.96
within that system then i'd like to hear

2373.68 --> 2378.3999999999996
about it

2374.96 --> 2381.04
huh peter and

2378.4 --> 2383.28
oh by the way dark matter it doesn't

2381.04 --> 2386.32
exist

2383.28 --> 2390.5600000000004
it's a conjured mathematics

2386.32 --> 2393.6800000000003
based thing virtual thing

2390.56 --> 2396.96
that was created just to

2393.68 --> 2399.839
to kind of like justify gravity

2396.96 --> 2400.48
because they had to balance it out if

2399.839 --> 2402.96
yeah

2400.48 --> 2404.72
still based on the old gravity it's all

2402.96 --> 2406.7200000000003
very very messy right because

2404.72 --> 2408.64
pseudo-ramon in force-based gravity it

2406.72 --> 2410.0
doesn't really require anything it can

2408.64 --> 2414.24
literally be molded into

2410.0 --> 2416.88
anything including adapt it to whatever

2414.24 --> 2420.16
sighting you have

2416.88 --> 2423.119
right it was hyper dynamic can solve any

2420.16 --> 2423.1189999999997
problem like that

2423.28 --> 2429.6800000000003
like to fool people

2426.64 --> 2432.72
but yeah the old dark matter still comes

2429.68 --> 2434.7999999999997
from from

2432.72 --> 2436.8799999999997
mass attracting mass because that is

2434.8 --> 2439.76
more calculable on a wider scale that's

2436.88 --> 2442.8
what they used for the original modeling

2439.76 --> 2445.2000000000003
and then they got into this huge problem

2442.8 --> 2446.48
mathematically and that's why they came

2445.2 --> 2448.96
up with dark matter

2446.48 --> 2451.839
to balance it out but it's a purely

2448.96 --> 2453.92
conjured phenomenon come on

2451.839 --> 2455.119
think about it dark matter it's a

2453.92 --> 2458.079
substance in a

2455.119 --> 2459.76
medium that's impossible you can't

2458.079 --> 2461.8390000000004
detect it you can't measure it it

2459.76 --> 2465.6800000000003
doesn't give off any effect

2461.839 --> 2468.24
to measure it's invisible

2465.68 --> 2471.1189999999997
you actually believe that that is

2468.24 --> 2471.1189999999997
physically real

2472.8 --> 2477.2000000000003
it must be kind of desperate to believe

2475.52 --> 2479.7599999999998
in such a thing that's like

2477.2 --> 2480.7999999999997
literal emperor's emperor the emperor's

2479.76 --> 2485.0400000000004
clothes

2480.8 --> 2494.8900000000003
are made of dark matter okay

2485.04 --> 2498.13
that's how bad it is

2494.89 --> 2498.1299999999997
[Music]

2502.85 --> 2506.73
[Music]

2508.319 --> 2512.8
yeah they don't like it when i get close

2510.56 --> 2513.599
to their personal favorite theories that

2512.8 --> 2516.88
they hold

2513.599 --> 2520.0
on to in their chanting

2516.88 --> 2522.0
to themselves process right

2520.0 --> 2524.079
where they have to convince themselves

2522.0 --> 2526.4
that they're still on the winning side

2524.079 --> 2528.5600000000004
on an intellectual developing side and

2526.4 --> 2530.2400000000002
some of these theories are in that

2528.56 --> 2532.24
corner

2530.24 --> 2533.7599999999998
the few places that are still left to

2532.24 --> 2539.04
them where they can

2533.76 --> 2542.48
imagine how their religion is superior

2539.04 --> 2545.599
right so every time somebody actually

2542.48 --> 2547.839
talks about those specific things

2545.599 --> 2549.44
in a way that actually makes sense right

2547.839 --> 2550.88
because they're very difficult a whole

2549.44 --> 2552.2400000000002
bunch of flat earthers when they talk

2550.88 --> 2554.079
about the 10 dimension they will just

2552.24 --> 2554.64
say add as a heliocentric nonsense and

2554.079 --> 2557.6800000000003
whatever

2554.64 --> 2561.5989999999997
right they won't actually consider

2557.68 --> 2564.0789999999997
what it really is and i do

2561.599 --> 2566.0
when i'm in the mood for it and that

2564.079 --> 2568.7200000000003
really triggers ballers because then

2566.0 --> 2573.119
suddenly their private tool

2568.72 --> 2575.5989999999997
just gripped from their dream

2573.119 --> 2578.319
and held up very close to that light

2575.599 --> 2580.8
that that hurts their eyes

2578.319 --> 2582.16
right and i take their tool away so of

2580.8 --> 2584.8
course

2582.16 --> 2586.8799999999997
the tool that was there to reinforce

2584.8 --> 2588.0
their sense of superiority

2586.88 --> 2590.4
so of course they're going to be

2588.0 --> 2590.4
triggered

2590.64 --> 2594.0
yeah i literally just grabbed in their

2593.599 --> 2596.8
head

2594.0 --> 2598.96
something that they thought was safe

2596.8 --> 2601.2000000000003
because nobody would understand

2598.96 --> 2602.4
and little art went in i just grabbed it

2601.2 --> 2604.56
just like that

2602.4 --> 2606.96
and started to point out things about in

2604.56 --> 2609.2799999999997
in like a legitimate level thing

2606.96 --> 2610.88
so of course immediately discredited

2609.28 --> 2613.599
immediately say that i don't know

2610.88 --> 2617.28
anything have no legitimacy

2613.599 --> 2622.48
don't actually talk about what i said

2617.28 --> 2622.48
about it huh sound familiar

2626.8 --> 2631.28
yes that's an at-home dean wrong

2631.359 --> 2638.24
i'm crazy because hey

2635.04 --> 2639.2
whoever actually thinks and considers

2638.24 --> 2642.4799999999996
things that are

2639.2 --> 2646.16
on average seen as too complex to really

2642.48 --> 2648.4
get a grip on and then successfully does

2646.16 --> 2650.72
some piece of reasoning with it yeah

2648.4 --> 2654.319
that that's a lunatic

2650.72 --> 2656.16
right lunatic isn't the the people that

2654.319 --> 2658.079
claim

2656.16 --> 2659.44
that the moon is actually a physical

2658.079 --> 2662.88
thing and that

2659.44 --> 2666.4
some people in

2662.88 --> 2668.4
diving suits sort of whatever they're

2666.4 --> 2670.64
yeah whatever they really are that they

2668.4 --> 2673.44
did they went there and landed there

2670.64 --> 2674.0
those aren't the lunatics right even

2673.44 --> 2676.7200000000003
though

2674.0 --> 2679.04
lunatic literally is derived from the

2676.72 --> 2691.839
word moon

2679.04 --> 2691.839
huh now we're the lunatics

2726.0 --> 2733.839
jesus is a different lord than yahweh

2729.44 --> 2733.839
then i'd say that jesus has taken over

2734.079 --> 2737.76
yeah if you're actually gonna say lord

2736.96 --> 2742.64
other lord

2737.76 --> 2742.6400000000003
well guess what boom there you go

2744.839 --> 2750.64
christ

2747.68 --> 2753.1189999999997
i've considered it like that the the old

2750.64 --> 2757.2
testament

2753.119 --> 2757.2000000000003
god is not the same entity

2757.68 --> 2763.52
or not developed

2761.2 --> 2764.68
to the same level that it might have

2763.52 --> 2766.88
been some sort of

2764.68 --> 2768.8799999999997
pre-experiment like experimental

2766.88 --> 2771.599
interaction with human stage

2768.88 --> 2773.6800000000003
like that like a cultural development

2771.599 --> 2776.56
attempt

2773.68 --> 2778.64
that's it's tough to say so many ways to

2776.56 --> 2781.2
look at it

2778.64 --> 2783.359
but yes i think that jesus is very

2781.2 --> 2785.96
different

2783.359 --> 2789.52
but you could they are potentially

2785.96 --> 2792.7200000000003
complementary though

2789.52 --> 2793.2
right jesus is what just that that way

2792.72 --> 2797.5989999999997
through

2793.2 --> 2797.5989999999997
that that optimal development

2799.68 --> 2804.3999999999996
when the old testament is much more just

2802.0 --> 2808.319
about

2804.4 --> 2811.52
like contracts and obedience

2808.319 --> 2817.839
and yeah

2811.52 --> 2817.839
more about that

2837.599 --> 2844.4
okay sure

2841.76 --> 2847.6800000000003
oh that's what i think it is among other

2844.4 --> 2851.04
things the bible is many things

2847.68 --> 2854.48
what it is not however is exclusively

2851.04 --> 2855.44
one thing right i think that's the main

2854.48 --> 2859.839
mistake

2855.44 --> 2859.839
people make

2863.01 --> 2870.349
[Music]

2873.52 --> 2876.96
okay that's a kind of silly thing to say

2875.44 --> 2881.68
good servant first you say

2876.96 --> 2883.76
it's the same and then both existed

2881.68 --> 2885.04
but if they're the same then they're not

2883.76 --> 2887.8390000000004
a both they're

2885.04 --> 2887.839
a singular

2888.72 --> 2906.5589999999997
just saying

2901.76 --> 2906.559
that's interesting one show of power

2907.92 --> 2912.48
yeah water into blood water into what

2911.28 --> 2915.92
yeah

2912.48 --> 2919.92
yeah i see the essential difference

2915.92 --> 2922.2400000000002
yeah i know right that doesn't make it

2919.92 --> 2929.839
exclusively what you're saying now

2922.24 --> 2929.839
though but i like the point

2932.48 --> 2935.76
the trinity it takes three no the

2935.04 --> 2939.44
trinity

2935.76 --> 2940.559
is it's a vatican puzzle it's something

2939.44 --> 2942.7200000000003
else

2940.559 --> 2945.52
i think that the trinity is something

2942.72 --> 2945.52
older even

2948.48 --> 2953.44
that was kind of like put on top of it

2952.079 --> 2957.8390000000004
all

2953.44 --> 2957.839
but it's so virtual

2969.76 --> 2973.76
what seeking star what does that mean

2974.0 --> 2985.839
uh so sulfur and mercury

2977.599 --> 2985.839
are matter all three of them

2993.76 --> 2997.3590000000004
she says walk on water while jelly kill

2996.16 --> 3000.72
enough that's

2997.359 --> 3000.72
yeah that's a good point

3009.92 --> 3013.839
most what

3014.96 --> 3017.28
what

3022.64 --> 3029.52
ah i

3026.319 --> 3032.5589999999997
don't know about that one

3029.52 --> 3041.839
moses is muhammad uh

3032.559 --> 3041.8390000000004
no i think you've gone a bridge too far

3066.839 --> 3069.839
so

3083.599 --> 3088.079
right or unless you mean like moses is

3086.319 --> 3088.8
muhammad unless you're like claiming

3088.079 --> 3092.319
that he

3088.8 --> 3093.44
is like a reincarnation of moses or

3092.319 --> 3097.119
something i don't know

3093.44 --> 3099.359
that this is this is getting a little

3097.119 --> 3111.839
weird to me

3099.359 --> 3111.839
what are you saying

3121.92 --> 3128.4
what's that again oh right yeah yeah

3124.96 --> 3128.4
the big black stone right

3132.8 --> 3138.0
yeah it would be nice a rat as i if you

3135.92 --> 3140.64
like make a little bit more cohesive

3138.0 --> 3141.52
sense instead of just like typing one or

3140.64 --> 3144.16
two words

3141.52 --> 3145.2
in chat continually like maybe you

3144.16 --> 3148.319
should form

3145.2 --> 3153.839
an actual point and just it's just

3148.319 --> 3153.839
just weird spamming out related words

3172.21 --> 3175.449
[Music]

3181.32 --> 3184.7690000000002
[Music]

3192.839 --> 3195.839
ugh

3230.079 --> 3237.599
right okay

3234.319 --> 3251.839
okay yeah you just said it

3237.599 --> 3251.839
yeah andrew piss off

3260.8 --> 3268.96
look are you saying

3264.96 --> 3272.4
that islam was around

3268.96 --> 3279.68
much earlier is that what you're saying

3272.4 --> 3283.119
because i've heard that like

3279.68 --> 3285.7599999999998
that muslims like

3283.119 --> 3287.04
that it's kind of different and that

3285.76 --> 3292.2400000000002
that has been

3287.04 --> 3295.359
around very long i've heard this before

3292.24 --> 3298.16
that it's actually not that young and

3295.359 --> 3301.2799999999997
that there might be yeah rewrites

3298.16 --> 3303.52
because of it but i

3301.28 --> 3304.4
i don't know man i haven't really dug

3303.52 --> 3307.839
into that

3304.4 --> 3307.839
i think it's kind of weird

3327.359 --> 3329.68
dude

3330.4 --> 3335.839
who said that i don't even remember

3339.2 --> 3342.96
as an oral tradition right would that

3341.28 --> 3345.44
make sense

3342.96 --> 3347.68
right because even in islam it's like oh

3345.44 --> 3350.7200000000003
don't depict

3347.68 --> 3353.04
don't depict the holy ones so it's

3350.72 --> 3355.68
almost like yeah keep it all verbal keep

3353.04 --> 3358.16
it purely as a verbal tradition well

3355.68 --> 3361.2799999999997
yeah who knows man like the muslim

3358.16 --> 3363.2
verbal tradition might be extremely old

3361.28 --> 3364.7200000000003
it would also explain some things about

3363.2 --> 3369.52
tartaria

3364.72 --> 3372.319
how it was in there as well

3369.52 --> 3373.68
well if tartare is that old and really

3372.319 --> 3377.52
built up with all that

3373.68 --> 3379.7599999999998
how how can islam be so

3377.52 --> 3379.7599999999998
young

3382.96 --> 3390.4
but then again maybe like muhammad and

3386.88 --> 3394.6800000000003
like how that is all portrayed is like a

3390.4 --> 3398.079
a renewal like a kind of a

3394.68 --> 3400.72
modernization from that time

3398.079 --> 3403.04
that it was already there for a very

3400.72 --> 3403.359
long time and they simply kind of used

3403.04 --> 3406.799
it

3403.359 --> 3406.799
and upgraded it

3407.52 --> 3410.079
kind of like

3411.04 --> 3418.64
how yeah the catholics upgraded

3414.559 --> 3420.7200000000003
jesus's this teachings not much of an

3418.64 --> 3422.16
upgrade really in retrospect but i don't

3420.72 --> 3424.3999999999996
want to make that exact

3422.16 --> 3426.24
same statement about islam i don't know

3424.4 --> 3428.559
enough about i'm just trying to kind of

3426.24 --> 3428.5589999999997
shape

3429.04 --> 3433.839
like how it really all happened

3435.92 --> 3442.0
but no that's okay good servant i'm

3439.04 --> 3442.0
trying to address

3442.64 --> 3448.319
allah here it seems to be

3446.079 --> 3449.599
having a little bit of difficulty

3448.319 --> 3453.44
keeping cohesive

3449.599 --> 3456.6400000000003
maybe he wasn't prepared for me actually

3453.44 --> 3458.839
require acquiring more details about

3456.64 --> 3462.799
what he's trying to

3458.839 --> 3465.52
convey it's all freemasonry oh yeah well

3462.799 --> 3467.2
there you go the i8064 that means

3465.52 --> 3469.119
you don't have to consider anything

3467.2 --> 3470.0789999999997
about him it's just all freemasonry

3469.119 --> 3473.28
right

3470.079 --> 3476.319
so why would you then try to figure out

3473.28 --> 3476.3190000000004
what actually happened

3486.4 --> 3489.76
okay hell brown

3494.319 --> 3499.7599999999998
dude hey if you wanna get all all like

3497.839 --> 3503.839
that

3499.76 --> 3507.599
that's fine

3503.839 --> 3517.839
it's not it's not my package

3507.599 --> 3517.839
to go there

3524.64 --> 3531.839
all right yeah take

3528.839 --> 3531.839
five

3542.799 --> 3547.04
anyone doing anything to better humanity

3544.72 --> 3550.319
well i am shown this

3547.04 --> 3553.52
doing it right now i'm discussing things

3550.319 --> 3554.5589999999997
i'm enlightening whatever somebody

3553.52 --> 3558.4
brings to the table

3554.559 --> 3561.6800000000003
anybody including tenacious

3558.4 --> 3565.52
religious zealots

3561.68 --> 3567.839
when they get in here like yourself yeah

3565.52 --> 3570.839
and it is effectively measurably

3567.839 --> 3573.52
improving humanity whoever is actually

3570.839 --> 3576.64
listening has the senses left

3573.52 --> 3578.72
and the will to actually tap into the

3576.64 --> 3581.2
level of what i'm saying

3578.72 --> 3581.839
attaining some of the skills that i have

3581.2 --> 3584.0
been

3581.839 --> 3586.88
laying out how they work to try and help

3584.0 --> 3592.0
people to actually ascend

3586.88 --> 3594.799
get a grip in the higher position

3592.0 --> 3596.72
yeah i am absolutely helping humanity

3594.799 --> 3599.44
with that

3596.72 --> 3602.0789999999997
how have you helped humanity today

3599.44 --> 3602.079
genders

3603.04 --> 3607.359
and what are like if you actually did

3606.0 --> 3610.0
anything

3607.359 --> 3612.24
for the benefit of others how is that

3610.0 --> 3614.559
gonna influence them on the long run

3612.24 --> 3615.04
effectively the specific actions you did

3614.559 --> 3617.76
could

3615.04 --> 3620.16
could you say the existential

3617.76 --> 3623.8390000000004
consequences of your influence how that

3620.16 --> 3625.359
improves humanity or you don't really

3623.839 --> 3627.52
want to talk about what you

3625.359 --> 3628.88
actually do with your life you just want

3627.52 --> 3634.079
to project

3628.88 --> 3634.079
all that ugliness onto me and the flat

3640.839 --> 3643.839
earthers

3658.319 --> 3671.839
what kind of a question is that peter i

3660.96 --> 3671.839
don't know

3687.76 --> 3693.6800000000003
how do we design ah

3691.2 --> 3694.5589999999997
that's a straw man question because

3693.68 --> 3699.04
you're assuming

3694.559 --> 3703.52
you have to decide on which one is right

3699.04 --> 3706.799
yeah so wrong

3703.52 --> 3709.52
what i do is i just go into

3706.799 --> 3711.119
whatever and figure out what is right

3709.52 --> 3713.28
about it what is wrong what is the

3711.119 --> 3716.6400000000003
balance

3713.28 --> 3717.44
why are these errors or lesser

3716.64 --> 3719.68
approaches

3717.44 --> 3721.119
in there because they probably serve a

3719.68 --> 3724.8799999999997
function some of it

3721.119 --> 3728.2400000000002
cultural like with the spirit of how

3724.88 --> 3731.92
things go about at the time that it was

3728.24 --> 3731.9199999999996
created probably even to

3733.52 --> 3740.24
to improve upon it right so yeah

3737.28 --> 3741.039
every religion it all has just

3740.24 --> 3743.52
information

3741.039 --> 3744.48
and stories what is what are you gonna

3743.52 --> 3747.599
get out of it

3744.48 --> 3748.4
right why would you say this is your lie

3747.599 --> 3752.079
because some

3748.4 --> 3754.799
[ __ ] [ __ ] with the title of priest

3752.079 --> 3755.8390000000004
within that religion told you that is

3754.799 --> 3758.72
all

3755.839 --> 3759.839
that they all the devil they all go to

3758.72 --> 3764.72
hell

3759.839 --> 3767.92
or whatever so because that [ __ ]

3764.72 --> 3769.2
clearly possessed by like dominating

3767.92 --> 3772.64
spirit that's like

3769.2 --> 3774.64
envious towards other approaches

3772.64 --> 3776.0789999999997
that's maybe not even realizing it maybe

3774.64 --> 3778.16
he was just conditioned through the

3776.079 --> 3780.319
priesthood traditions to do that

3778.16 --> 3781.52
so you're gonna associate the entire

3780.319 --> 3785.44
body of work with

3781.52 --> 3785.44
the attitude of those people

3785.68 --> 3792.319
or you could just ignore those dicks

3789.039 --> 3794.3190000000004
and their ego struggles and actually

3792.319 --> 3796.64
look at the material

3794.319 --> 3799.52
and then figure out what is in there

3796.64 --> 3799.52
what does it mean

3800.079 --> 3804.799
and how do i cross-reference this with

3802.799 --> 3807.7599999999998
the other materials

3804.799 --> 3808.96
to in order to extract good

3807.76 --> 3812.559
cross-references

3808.96 --> 3813.119
more and wisdom and insight maybe even

3812.559 --> 3815.28
tricks

3813.119 --> 3817.2000000000003
practical tricks all of that there's a

3815.28 --> 3818.1600000000003
lot of valuable information in all

3817.2 --> 3825.839
religions

3818.16 --> 3825.839
almost all of them

3838.079 --> 3853.8390000000004
i did put you in a timeout

3867.039 --> 3871.92
all right well yeah some parts will

3869.52 --> 3874.88
contradict each other habron

3871.92 --> 3875.359
you're gonna have to get over that and

3874.88 --> 3878.799
maybe

3875.359 --> 3878.799
focus on something else

3878.88 --> 3885.44
about it like what is the story about

3882.4 --> 3888.559
it what does it do to

3885.44 --> 3891.039
your mind to your heart to your spirit

3888.559 --> 3891.6800000000003
in different angles of approaching

3891.039 --> 3895.2000000000003
different

3891.68 --> 3898.3999999999996
approaches to when you

3895.2 --> 3902.0789999999997
engage in reading and visualizing

3898.4 --> 3902.079
in such a part of the book

3907.039 --> 3923.8390000000004
because you were squirting the eye

3910.16 --> 3923.839
that's why

3940.319 --> 3958.81
oh god you're good again whatever man

3951.46 --> 3958.81
[Music]

3962.839 --> 3965.839
uh

3976.839 --> 3979.839
so

3984.0 --> 3988.799
yeah you were talking doom and gloom and

3986.4 --> 3992.0
didn't stop when i pointed it out

3988.799 --> 3995.92
the eye that's not the first

3992.0 --> 3999.119
time if you're literally gonna say

3995.92 --> 4002.2400000000002
it's all dead the past it's all buried

3999.119 --> 4006.559
you can't do any that's squirting

4002.24 --> 4008.3999999999996
that's basically saying it's all lost

4006.559 --> 4010.3190000000004
right and then you double down on that a

4008.4 --> 4021.839
couple of times so i timed you out now

4010.319 --> 4021.839
get over it

4039.28 --> 4044.4
all right yeah by the way thanks for

4042.079 --> 4048.48
being in chat good servant

4044.4 --> 4051.6800000000003
you seem to be doing pretty good

4048.48 --> 4055.76
i appreciate like the the tone you're

4051.68 --> 4055.7599999999998
upholding very stable

4055.839 --> 4058.4
that's good

4060.64 --> 4065.44
okay you know doom and gloom in your

4062.4 --> 4068.96
life well then maybe it was sarcasm

4065.44 --> 4068.96
right it's not appreciated

4070.24 --> 4074.319
now get the [ __ ] over that i timed you

4073.119 --> 4077.839
out for it

4074.319 --> 4077.839
or i'm gonna ban you

4078.64 --> 4081.1189999999997
all right

4088.72 --> 4093.9199999999996
all right ah man time has flown

4094.24 --> 4099.839
i don't really want to end the show yet

4096.239 --> 4104.239
i'm i'm doing just great i haven't had a

4099.839 --> 4106.799
stop complaining now

4104.239 --> 4108.48
yeah it's all there in the chat right

4106.799 --> 4110.64
and i'm not the only one

4108.48 --> 4111.599999999999
pointing at it seeking star wars also

4110.64 --> 4115.6
picked up on it

4111.6 --> 4119.839
so don't don't do this

4115.6 --> 4119.839
just drop it

4120.719 --> 4125.52
who gives a [ __ ] dude who gives a [ __ ]

4131.44 --> 4137.12
like is he supposed to be a threat now

4134.239 --> 4137.12
because he isn't

4139.679 --> 4147.839
he hasn't actually accomplished anything

4144.239 --> 4148.799
like noteworthy since he went back to

4147.839 --> 4152.3189999999995
the ball so

4148.799 --> 4152.319
who gives a [ __ ] what he does

4155.359 --> 4157.6
right

4158.4 --> 4167.839
okay oh hey if you're gonna be like that

4161.92 --> 4167.839
then yeah bye be right back in two

4172.839 --> 4175.839
minutes

4298.84 --> 4301.84
hmm

4340.84 --> 4343.84
hmm

4345.36 --> 4347.759999999999
all right

4354.84 --> 4359.76

4373.65 --> 4376.79
[Music]

4380.8 --> 4384.56
no peter no we're not upset by you stop

4383.679 --> 4387.12
trying to

4384.56 --> 4389.360000000001
pretend like you were this major

4387.12 --> 4391.5199999999995
influencer here

4389.36 --> 4393.36
you're not we're not upset by your

4391.52 --> 4396.159000000001
presence

4393.36 --> 4398.799999999999
i personally was annoyed by the eyes

4396.159 --> 4403.28
attitude but nothing you've said

4398.8 --> 4407.28
throughout this entire show

4403.28 --> 4407.28
is really having much of an influence

4411.52 --> 4413.84
right

4415.76 --> 4420.320000000001
you bring up ranty doesn't do anything

4421.76 --> 4425.679
well yeah oh you're not anything well

4424.56 --> 4429.76
why would you then

4425.679 --> 4441.84
assume that everyone got upset

4429.76 --> 4441.84
and it's so clear to you

4467.36 --> 4469.839999999999
oh really

4471.04 --> 4474.8
i don't give a [ __ ] oh that oh when i

4474.0 --> 4478.64
say that

4474.8 --> 4478.64
that's a sign i'm upset is it

4480.4 --> 4487.199
or is it just a minor communication

4483.199 --> 4487.199
pointing out some level of disdain

4487.28 --> 4490.719
right like we're supposed to care are we

4490.0 --> 4494.64
gonna oh

4490.719 --> 4498.2390000000005
no ranty not ranty oh no

4494.64 --> 4501.6
i always like the guy so much man

4498.239 --> 4505.12
it's not like he's nagged me endlessly

4501.6 --> 4505.120000000001
way before he even did this

4508.88 --> 4512.159000000001
yeah i agree there

4513.6 --> 4517.76
good servant although it's five minutes

4519.84 --> 4525.04
i only want thoughts oh

4525.199 --> 4528.879999999999
oh you're the special boy you're you're

4528.48 --> 4532.159
just

4528.88 --> 4539.84
way above all of us oh

4532.159 --> 4539.839999999999
you're so good

4544.32 --> 4549.199
[Music]

4545.76 --> 4549.1990000000005
this is getting kind of silly

4550.8 --> 4556.0
yeah by the way hello agm good to see

4553.12 --> 4556.0
you you're late

4558.0 --> 4564.159
we're running on bonus time right now

4561.76 --> 4566.159000000001
but yeah i do feel like it i am doing

4564.159 --> 4568.08
much better

4566.159 --> 4581.839999999999
than i was yesterday and especially the

4568.08 --> 4581.84
day before

4586.83 --> 4589.89
[Music]

4590.56 --> 4594.2390000000005
okay that's a that's a big statement to

4593.199 --> 4597.5199999999995
make

4594.239 --> 4600.48
there jesus dying for you

4597.52 --> 4604.2390000000005
by the way i disagree with your name but

4600.48 --> 4604.239
let's not get into all that again

4604.96 --> 4609.84
like sent by satan no no

4610.239 --> 4625.44
that they are going there perhaps

4622.64 --> 4625.4400000000005
i i don't know

4625.84 --> 4637.84
just seems a little dramatic to me

4642.159 --> 4649.839999999999
all right what is satan yeah

4645.92 --> 4650.32
what to me especially when you say

4649.84 --> 4652.8
things

4650.32 --> 4654.88
sent by satan oh really so where's that

4652.8 --> 4657.679
literal physical figure

4654.88 --> 4658.32
that contacted them with like visual

4657.679 --> 4660.2390000000005
personal

4658.32 --> 4661.84
and then sent them right that gets a

4660.239 --> 4664.08
little dramatic

4661.84 --> 4665.28
and if you're gonna say okay satan is

4664.08 --> 4668.0
just lies

4665.28 --> 4669.44
god is just truth right see it more as

4668.0 --> 4672.4
an esoteric

4669.44 --> 4673.919999999999
essence and all the existential

4672.4 --> 4676.96
consequent the fractal

4673.92 --> 4678.64
consequences and all that then

4676.96 --> 4680.159
yeah you could say yeah they were sent

4678.64 --> 4682.400000000001
by say but it sounds

4680.159 --> 4683.44
over dramatic and it's very easy to kind

4682.4 --> 4685.599999999999
of

4683.44 --> 4686.879999999999
mistake it for some another

4685.6 --> 4690.2390000000005
interpretation

4686.88 --> 4692.400000000001
right if you said okay yeah they are

4690.239 --> 4694.48
liars in ways they are kind of

4692.4 --> 4696.96
gatekeeping things

4694.48 --> 4698.718999999999
or upholding specific illusions that

4696.96 --> 4701.04
deviate

4698.719 --> 4701.92
and in that sense like they're wrong

4701.04 --> 4704.239
they're and they

4701.92 --> 4706.0
hold on to what they're wrong at for the

4704.239 --> 4708.799999999999
wrong reasons

4706.0 --> 4709.679
etc etc then you could say yeah yeah

4708.8 --> 4712.400000000001
they

4709.679 --> 4715.36
they have let lies slip in in different

4712.4 --> 4718.879999999999
ways and with that

4715.36 --> 4723.36
they moved away frequency wise from god

4718.88 --> 4726.159000000001
yes so in that sense you could say it

4723.36 --> 4727.44
that is most obvious with ranty because

4726.159 --> 4734.239
yeah

4727.44 --> 4738.239
because it's just obvious

4734.239 --> 4738.239
because it's just also in your face

4739.6 --> 4744.08
they did it off their own bat right well

4743.04 --> 4747.36
that's all

4744.08 --> 4751.28
it's all doing it off your own back like

4747.36 --> 4754.159
satan doesn't do [ __ ]

4751.28 --> 4755.599999999999
he's only there to seduce like through

4754.159 --> 4758.639999999999
lucifer

4755.6 --> 4762.4800000000005
and arimon the spirits spirit of

4758.64 --> 4765.679
seduction and doom

4762.48 --> 4766.718999999999
and then the people do it right now you

4765.679 --> 4769.76
could say okay they

4766.719 --> 4772.08
made the people do it but

4769.76 --> 4773.679
they are not even people so you can only

4772.08 --> 4776.08
point at people when it comes to

4773.679 --> 4778.88
responsibility so the people eventually

4776.08 --> 4779.76
take the responsibility so were they

4778.88 --> 4782.64
sent by

4779.76 --> 4782.64
or did they just

4782.96 --> 4791.84
get into business with

4791.92 --> 4794.96
free will indeed

4802.48 --> 4807.44
and facts being charred from oh god

4804.56 --> 4807.4400000000005
gonna bring that up

4812.96 --> 4820.88
i've been hearing some freaky things

4818.56 --> 4820.88
ugh

4824.32 --> 4830.88
yeah you want to read some

4827.44 --> 4833.919999999999
yeah don't mean just some

4830.88 --> 4837.4400000000005
bad news [ __ ]

4833.92 --> 4837.4400000000005
and i predicted this

4840.159 --> 4846.5599999999995
i i cried out for that some time ago

4844.719 --> 4848.2390000000005
when the the vaccine [ __ ] was really

4846.56 --> 4850.8
gonna hit the world it's like

4848.239 --> 4850.799999999999
don't

4851.6 --> 4854.4800000000005
like don't

4855.199 --> 4858.638999999999
don't do it with the children now there

4856.88 --> 4860.400000000001
seems to be plenty of reason now

4858.639 --> 4863.6
empirically derived

4860.4 --> 4865.679
as to why you shouldn't do that

4863.6 --> 4867.04
right so if you want to squirt over the

4865.679 --> 4874.35
vaccine [ __ ]

4867.04 --> 4877.489
there you go

4874.35 --> 4877.4890000000005
[Music]

4886.84 --> 4889.84
francis

4889.97 --> 4893.689
[Music]

4898.18 --> 4904.29
[Music]

4916.56 --> 4921.04
i i might be mistaken but i even think

4919.28 --> 4924.4
that this pope

4921.04 --> 4926.719
everything he's doing has done since he

4924.4 --> 4930.239
got into his office

4926.719 --> 4932.0
i think that a whole big part of the

4930.239 --> 4934.0
entire catholic world like

4932.0 --> 4936.56
really doesn't appreciate him for what

4934.0 --> 4936.56
he's doing

4937.76 --> 4940.08
right

4940.8 --> 4944.4800000000005
so doesn't mean that there won't be

4943.92 --> 4947.52
people

4944.48 --> 4950.239
just blindly following him in the moment

4947.52 --> 4950.2390000000005
of whatever

4951.12 --> 4954.159
because they don't really know what else

4952.96 --> 4957.76
he's saying

4954.159 --> 4959.599999999999
but those that know what he's actually

4957.76 --> 4962.0
doing they're probably the vast majority

4959.6 --> 4962.719
of them within catholicism really don't

4962.0 --> 4965.28
appreciate

4962.719 --> 4965.28
this pope

4969.52 --> 4976.96
oh seeking star wars that's just

4973.199 --> 4987.839999999999
nasty did it's too much for this chat

4976.96 --> 4987.84
please don't

4989.199 --> 4996.239
yeah i i get it like i got it

4992.56 --> 5000.4800000000005
i don't want the that to be red

4996.239 --> 5003.5199999999995
sorry might yeah it's it's just not

5000.48 --> 5003.5199999999995
let's not go there

5004.8 --> 5015.84
but yes he is pretty disgusting

5060.0 --> 5069.199
oh peter going away in a dramatic exit

5066.08 --> 5070.159
again despite his claims no i'm very

5069.199 --> 5073.678999999999
insignificant

5070.159 --> 5077.28
he's still giving off the flare like

5073.679 --> 5078.639
you just lost me it's the first time i

5077.28 --> 5082.0
got here

5078.639 --> 5085.12
it's the last time

5082.0 --> 5086.4
good luck because arwyn's gonna need so

5085.12 --> 5089.44
much luck now that

5086.4 --> 5091.92
peter oh my god peter first time visit

5089.44 --> 5095.12
has left my chat

5091.92 --> 5097.76
ooh dark times now that peter has left

5095.12 --> 5097.76
my chat

5098.719 --> 5103.44
how will she how will we survive without

5101.28 --> 5103.44
him

5108.96 --> 5114.4800000000005
oh you won yeah you want me to read out

5111.92 --> 5114.4800000000005
what he said

5116.32 --> 5123.12
oh wait it's not deleted though i he's

5119.44 --> 5126.5599999999995
not even timed out he just left

5123.12 --> 5129.12
so scroll up back to

5126.56 --> 5129.120000000001
where is it

5135.52 --> 5138.88
yet to 323

5139.04 --> 5144.88
to 23 minutes it's over there

5142.48 --> 5144.879999999999
anyway

5149.12 --> 5152.32
now i already removed it seeking star

5151.6 --> 5155.84
water

5152.32 --> 5155.84
it's okay

5159.76 --> 5165.52
wow you retracted it after i deleted it

5163.12 --> 5165.5199999999995
hmm

5166.719 --> 5169.84
i did what

5170.8 --> 5174.0
but that's fine seeking star wars it's

5172.719 --> 5176.719
like i get it

5174.0 --> 5179.6
it's just that i don't want that kind of

5176.719 --> 5182.96
talk like on the early bird show

5179.6 --> 5183.76
it's too dark right yeah there's so much

5182.96 --> 5186.719
sick dark

5183.76 --> 5186.719
fantasy [ __ ]

5187.12 --> 5194.08
that it's really bad to even let that

5190.639 --> 5195.52
type of process just too near right yeah

5194.08 --> 5197.92
they might do it

5195.52 --> 5200.88
it's no use dwelling on it you'll just

5197.92 --> 5200.88
get sick from it

5208.84 --> 5212.32
right

5210.08 --> 5214.719
huh yes i agree good servant and and

5212.32 --> 5214.719
jesus

5214.8 --> 5218.320000000001
basically warned about that

5220.719 --> 5224.4800000000005
it's one of one of the things i

5222.32 --> 5227.12
appreciate him so much for and it is

5224.48 --> 5230.32
really the thing that saved him

5227.12 --> 5232.719
to me when i wasn't that

5230.32 --> 5234.5599999999995
that finely tuned yet still kind of

5232.719 --> 5239.84
delusional on my part

5234.56 --> 5239.84
in ways is that

5241.6 --> 5247.04
that he himself said don't do religions

5245.04 --> 5249.6
it's a personal thing and once i heard

5247.04 --> 5252.0
that which came kind of late

5249.6 --> 5253.84
of truly realizing what that means it's

5252.0 --> 5257.199
not some kind of trope that's a weird

5253.84 --> 5260.2390000000005
thing i thought it was kind of a trope

5257.199 --> 5262.5599999999995
didn't understand it now i understand

5260.239 --> 5264.5599999999995
like wow that's really significant

5262.56 --> 5266.080000000001
because of the implications of what has

5264.56 --> 5269.360000000001
happened since and is being

5266.08 --> 5274.239
ignored and that's how basically

5269.36 --> 5277.04
jesus's purity is like this bright light

5274.239 --> 5278.239
that is being kept into a ball of

5277.04 --> 5280.88
darkness

5278.239 --> 5282.638999999999
and on top of that a whole layer of gold

5280.88 --> 5285.76
distractions

5282.639 --> 5286.679
right so they're like the catholicism

5285.76 --> 5292.08
has

5286.679 --> 5292.08
encapsulated christ's teachings

5292.639 --> 5297.92
they're like falsely but still

5296.0 --> 5309.84
effectively wielding it

5297.92 --> 5309.84
in a very wizardly way

5327.44 --> 5331.839999999999
organized religion has enslaved it

5333.52 --> 5337.84
how do you know that

5344.32 --> 5346.5599999999995
that

5348.84 --> 5365.84
really how did you get the numbers for

5351.6 --> 5365.84
all that iron iffy

5374.08 --> 5383.679
protestant reformation

5379.199 --> 5386.48
not entirely ajm

5383.679 --> 5388.4
but it was a logical response move the

5386.48 --> 5390.0
problem is it's still an organized

5388.4 --> 5392.239
religion

5390.0 --> 5393.52
it's a little bit more in the right

5392.239 --> 5396.0
direction but there's still

5393.52 --> 5399.4400000000005
many issues and it has like a fast

5396.0 --> 5399.44
cultural adaptation

5400.32 --> 5407.84
that comes with it

5409.199 --> 5421.839999999999
so like yeah

5431.199 --> 5434.48
no george sanford don't straw man good

5433.679 --> 5436.719
servant

5434.48 --> 5438.959999999999
i i really don't appreciate you doing

5436.719 --> 5438.96
that

5442.8 --> 5446.320000000001
right organized religion when you

5445.04 --> 5449.6
literally use that

5446.32 --> 5451.759999999999
as as the target of a worship when you

5449.6 --> 5453.04
try to pin that on somebody then you are

5451.76 --> 5457.92
also

5453.04 --> 5460.639
painting on him the belief in man

5457.92 --> 5462.4
giving the authority to a priest right

5460.639 --> 5464.2390000000005
that's really part of the organized

5462.4 --> 5465.28
religion i don't think good servant is

5464.239 --> 5469.199
like that

5465.28 --> 5471.04
or not anymore at least he knows

5469.199 --> 5473.04
by christ's own teaching that it's

5471.04 --> 5474.84
really about the individual and their

5473.04 --> 5476.32
understanding and their relation with

5474.84 --> 5478.88
god

5476.32 --> 5480.48
so he does not worship a organized

5478.88 --> 5483.36
religion

5480.48 --> 5486.48
he says the word of jesus right that's

5483.36 --> 5488.5599999999995
being very specific

5486.48 --> 5490.879999999999
that's not what somebody else is going

5488.56 --> 5494.159000000001
to tell him about what jesus

5490.88 --> 5496.4800000000005
meant or anything he might listen to it

5494.159 --> 5498.5599999999995
but in the end it comes to the words of

5496.48 --> 5505.839999999999
jesus not what somebody else is telling

5498.56 --> 5505.84
him about it

5510.56 --> 5514.56
you're right oh hm well you're giving me

5512.88 --> 5516.56
the shivers because that's one of my

5514.56 --> 5519.92
things

5516.56 --> 5523.280000000001
no secrets pure

5519.92 --> 5526.56
pure open truth is one of my

5523.28 --> 5533.84
things my vows you could say

5526.56 --> 5533.84
towards god it's part of what i do

5535.84 --> 5547.84
because i can

5564.0 --> 5577.6
all right

5574.08 --> 5580.5599999999995
right well with belief you know

5577.6 --> 5581.679
believing to it's it's not even belief

5580.56 --> 5584.56
is the wrong word it

5581.679 --> 5585.12
belief came in through priesthood it

5584.56 --> 5588.320000000001
belief

5585.12 --> 5591.5199999999995
actually stands for trust you trust

5588.32 --> 5592.32
the essence of it but most important is

5591.52 --> 5596.400000000001
it

5592.32 --> 5598.239
is the understanding understanding

5596.4 --> 5600.638999999999
what it actually means and the

5598.239 --> 5603.759999999999
implications

5600.639 --> 5606.88
true insight and understanding is

5603.76 --> 5609.1990000000005
what really makes what jesus did and

5606.88 --> 5611.52
said so glorious

5609.199 --> 5613.678999999999
that's when it becomes extra powerful

5611.52 --> 5617.84
just the more you understand

5613.679 --> 5617.84
the more powerful he becomes

5618.96 --> 5625.44
to your conscience you start to get it

5622.4 --> 5627.28
right the real all comes when you truly

5625.44 --> 5630.719
start to understand and not just

5627.28 --> 5634.08
take for granted believe

5630.719 --> 5636.4800000000005
trust without understanding right

5634.08 --> 5638.0
when you actually start to understand

5636.48 --> 5640.638999999999
the get the insight

5638.0 --> 5643.28
attaining what it all stands for in the

5640.639 --> 5646.32
existential consequences then

5643.28 --> 5647.679
not because told by others but you see

5646.32 --> 5650.88
it

5647.679 --> 5653.92
you understand it without words right

5650.88 --> 5655.1990000000005
that's when the real power of jesus

5653.92 --> 5658.56
starts to

5655.199 --> 5661.678999999999
shine bright unbelievable

5658.56 --> 5661.679
that's my experience

5662.719 --> 5667.52
so don't let other people straw man

5665.6 --> 5673.84
christ

5667.52 --> 5673.84
to take away that brightness for you

5687.52 --> 5689.84
wow

5690.88 --> 5697.92
okay irony that's crazy 90

5695.119 --> 5697.92
a charity

5698.639 --> 5705.4400000000005
right but then again do the people

5702.32 --> 5708.239
that donate know that right

5705.44 --> 5711.5199999999995
do they know that or are they actually

5708.239 --> 5714.799999999999
saying no this is all going to charity

5711.52 --> 5718.080000000001
what what are you doing

5714.8 --> 5718.08
clutch bear what are you doing

5726.8 --> 5729.84
what the hell

5733.84 --> 5738.2390000000005
clutch bear can you please justify why

5736.32 --> 5743.84
you just

5738.239 --> 5743.839999999999
banned iron fe

5754.719 --> 5761.52
thank clutch bear

5757.84 --> 5764.4800000000005
can you please speak up and justify why

5761.52 --> 5764.4800000000005
you just banned him

5765.119 --> 5771.28
your kid oh it's okay

5768.88 --> 5774.4800000000005
it was technical i thought so it was

5771.28 --> 5774.48
very out of place there

5777.44 --> 5780.96
all right all right it's okay no not too

5779.84 --> 5785.84
much harm done it

5780.96 --> 5785.84
like what he said was still in the chat

5791.52 --> 5795.52
in the chat on the screen so

5796.32 --> 5799.84
took my phone g3

5805.36 --> 5808.96
that's okay clutch but don't worry

5810.239 --> 5813.36
it's surprising though how easily you

5812.4 --> 5827.839999999999
can

5813.36 --> 5827.839999999999
by accident ban somebody that's weird

5830.56 --> 5836.080000000001
all right well george sanford that's all

5838.84 --> 5841.84
fine

5880.88 --> 5897.84
hey random explorer

5908.84 --> 5913.92

5917.84 --> 5920.719
i appreciate it

5923.44 --> 5927.28
pocket band situat yeah yeah

5927.36 --> 5939.839999999999
pocket banning

5943.6 --> 5946.96
all right guys i think i'm gonna round

5945.199 --> 5949.28
out the show already

5946.96 --> 5953.84
went over with 42 minutes it's been

5949.28 --> 5953.84
pretty good

5954.08 --> 5958.5599999999995
i think that it's a good time to round

5956.4 --> 5958.5599999999995
out

5962.8 --> 5967.84
yeah thank you for the good vibes random

5964.84 --> 5967.84
explorer

5972.48 --> 5981.839999999999
right unless somebody specifically

5975.04 --> 5981.84
objects and wants to bring up a subject

5987.679 --> 5992.4800000000005
it is in our cultures that women should

5989.76 --> 5992.4800000000005
remain pure

5995.84 --> 6009.84
my viticus right

6016.8 --> 6023.84
all right

6033.6 --> 6039.1990000000005
wait are you actually asking why to what

6036.719 --> 6039.199
you said

6040.48 --> 6046.879999999999
built in division no no

6043.84 --> 6050.2390000000005
no men and women are different

6046.88 --> 6055.36
and they respond very differently to

6050.239 --> 6055.36
corrupting influences right

6062.159 --> 6065.839999999999
and it seems that

6067.04 --> 6070.8
i can't even say that i really

6068.88 --> 6074.32
personally know but

6070.8 --> 6077.1990000000005
it seems like when women corrupt it gets

6074.32 --> 6081.599999999999
really bad when man corrupt they can

6077.199 --> 6081.599999999999
still kind of be kept under control and

6082.8 --> 6088.8
it's different so just on average

6086.96 --> 6091.04
right it's like a social engineering

6088.8 --> 6091.04
thing

6091.199 --> 6093.839999999999
that's ancient

6095.92 --> 6099.04
so it's always like no keep the women

6097.84 --> 6101.92
pure because

6099.04 --> 6103.199
if you don't then you'll have a bunch of

6101.92 --> 6105.52
out of control women

6103.199 --> 6107.36
on your hands that are like really out

6105.52 --> 6110.0
of control

6107.36 --> 6112.32
and with men it's different just the

6110.0 --> 6115.679
existential consequences are different

6112.32 --> 6121.84
a much more controllable

6115.679 --> 6121.84
that's it that's what i think

6142.0 --> 6148.08
right yeah but hey

6145.04 --> 6151.5199999999995
remaining pure is good for everybody how

6148.08 --> 6151.5199999999995
inconvenient for men

6151.84 --> 6157.4400000000005
hey we're different so there's

6154.4 --> 6163.839999999999
advantages and disadvantages on both

6157.44 --> 6163.839999999999
sides yeah

6178.56 --> 6181.679
right yeah good servant you're being

6180.159 --> 6184.5599999999995
very nice hey

6181.679 --> 6186.159
i do the same i take sex very serious

6184.56 --> 6190.0
it's not

6186.159 --> 6192.32
do i don't do [ __ ] around like that

6190.0 --> 6194.4
borderlined it but i could never get

6192.32 --> 6197.679
myself even to just do it

6194.4 --> 6200.638999999999
when i didn't in some way love

6197.679 --> 6201.28
love them right i just can't do it it

6200.639 --> 6204.0
really

6201.28 --> 6206.4
sucks like it literally sucks the spirit

6204.0 --> 6206.4
out of me

6206.96 --> 6212.08
when you do it's just everything about

6208.8 --> 6212.08
it starts to feel wrong

6212.159 --> 6216.799999999999
right so i've always taken that very

6214.239 --> 6216.799999999999
serious

6217.6 --> 6224.639
and yeah just don't get sex addicted

6221.92 --> 6224.639
very simple

6225.6 --> 6233.84
that's women for your are twins

6238.159 --> 6244.0
why well you'd have to undo

6241.76 --> 6245.76
like a hundred years of feminism

6244.0 --> 6247.04
programming in order to be able to

6245.76 --> 6261.84
understand that again

6247.04 --> 6261.84
here we go again right

6278.159 --> 6289.839999999999
right clutch bear yeah

6296.4 --> 6302.159
spirit is corrupted by sex well

6300.0 --> 6304.239
i think there are certain levels where

6302.159 --> 6307.119
you could just do it right

6304.239 --> 6307.919999999999
don't overdo sex again don't get

6307.119 --> 6311.199
addicted

6307.92 --> 6312.88
and always do it with love like that

6311.199 --> 6317.678999999999
like weirdly enough i kind of learned

6312.88 --> 6322.08
that from my mother verbally thanks

6317.679 --> 6324.4800000000005
and she even broke her own rules

6322.08 --> 6326.48
with that and that's probably how she

6324.48 --> 6328.32
came to that conclusion

6326.48 --> 6329.678999999999
so she kind of like emphasized i was

6328.32 --> 6330.0
always taught like they'll do things

6329.679 --> 6333.84
with

6330.0 --> 6337.04
love like and then take it very serious

6333.84 --> 6340.96
that love that essence right

6337.04 --> 6344.4
and that's been helpful

6340.96 --> 6347.76
for preventing me to really dive into

6344.4 --> 6348.239
like sexual darkness and [ __ ] where you

6347.76 --> 6350.400000000001
do

6348.239 --> 6352.5599999999995
become a genuine addict and you don't

6350.4 --> 6354.159
respect women anymore and [ __ ] because

6352.56 --> 6359.84
of it

6354.159 --> 6359.839999999999
i never went there

6369.119 --> 6387.839999999999
whoa celibate for 11 years

6373.119 --> 6387.839999999999
whoa okay

6398.239 --> 6404.638999999999
man that's a long time

6401.28 --> 6406.88
for me that will be a long time like

6404.639 --> 6408.0
i haven't had a girlfriend since my ex

6406.88 --> 6410.88
for now what is it

6408.0 --> 6413.04
seven years i think this isn't like

6410.88 --> 6414.0
insanely long time for me and i'm i'm

6413.04 --> 6418.08
kind of ready

6414.0 --> 6420.159
i think pretty long for it

6418.08 --> 6422.4
to maybe get into a relationship again

6420.159 --> 6426.96
but i don't even know if i can anymore

6422.4 --> 6429.199
because of how i've developed

6426.96 --> 6429.199
uh

6432.96 --> 6436.159
or maybe it's just i'm gonna have to

6434.8 --> 6438.56
approach it in a new way

6436.159 --> 6439.44
and not the old way because i have

6438.56 --> 6441.4400000000005
developed

6439.44 --> 6443.36
well i'll figure it out when it when it

6441.44 --> 6445.5199999999995
arrives when that starts to happen when

6443.36 --> 6445.5199999999995
