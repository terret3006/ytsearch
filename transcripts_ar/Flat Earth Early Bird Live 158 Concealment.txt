206.97 --> 211.159
again been having a back and forth with

208.98 --> 220.58999999999997
Daniel Rambo Shambo is here

211.159 --> 223.94899999999998
Juan Carlos Robert Cassidy's brand m101

220.59 --> 234.54
rock hound Karen B I level awakening

223.949 --> 237.049
Graham brown ally be right good to see

234.54 --> 237.04899999999998
you all

237.199 --> 250.859
all right two minutes of silence typical

243.379 --> 254.459
so yeah lots of media stuff happening

250.859 --> 258.15000000000003
especially concerning the Cathedral it

254.459 --> 263.909
is as I suspected the fire is not that

258.15 --> 267.17999999999995
bad for example Owen Benjamin completely

263.909 --> 270.09
overdramatized it said burning down to

267.18 --> 272.34000000000003
the ground and yeah it's a lot

270.09 --> 276.53999999999996
surrounding that a lot of shameless

272.34 --> 278.94
tweets and such out there being all

276.54 --> 281.37
positive about this happening but yeah

278.94 --> 283.8
because of the way it's built it's

281.37 --> 286.17
pretty much only the roof that's burned

283.8 --> 288.63
down and I have seen photos and I'm

286.17 --> 294.0
gonna share some of those she give me a

288.63 --> 294.63
minute and yeah the the roofs come it's

294.0 --> 302.51
gone

294.63 --> 302.51
but when you look at the rest of it

314.719 --> 327.199
right info ours article we uh yeah

321.229 --> 333.399
they do that job well enough when it

327.199 --> 333.399
concerns this kind of thing alright so

333.61 --> 336.61
yay

339.96 --> 346.71
so yeah if you look at this you don't

344.759 --> 348.99
see any damage in the back here like

346.71 --> 351.9
even the glass stained windows over

348.99 --> 354.12
there still fine yeah

351.9 --> 356.60999999999996
the tower is totally gone the roof is

354.12 --> 368.63
totally gone so yeah a chunk of it is

356.61 --> 368.63
definitely missing but yeah

370.11 --> 376.05
let's see if I'm presenting yeah you're

372.81 --> 380.819
seeing this exactly so if you see look

376.05 --> 384.24
see most of the structure of the church

380.819 --> 386.159
seems to be pretty much fine there's

384.24 --> 390.15000000000003
some damage from everything that's

386.159 --> 392.879
fallen down definitely there's there's

390.15 --> 397.85999999999996
going to be some damage absolutely but

392.879 --> 405.15000000000003
yeah it seems that yeah just look at

397.86 --> 412.62
this so the fire has been pretty local

405.15 --> 415.5
and I I'd say this is restorable if for

412.62 --> 421.409
a layman wet finger work I'd say okay

415.5 --> 424.139
maybe 1/4 third is seriously damaged but

421.409 --> 430.49
it's it's not destroyed by a long shot

424.139 --> 430.49
so that's good news good news everyone

431.09 --> 439.25899999999996
I'm pretty relieved by it because yeah

436.86 --> 441.3
when you were look it is still mostly a

439.259 --> 444.24
stone building and that's what saved it

441.3 --> 447.21000000000004
it's just a roof that is comprised of a

444.24 --> 454.8
lot of wood and such yeah that's that's

447.21 --> 457.169
gone anyway but right and there's been a

454.8 --> 460.879
lot of donations I speculated yesterday

457.169 --> 464.60999999999996
they were yeah

460.879 --> 467.819
some weirdo Castle vampire may if

464.61 --> 469.889
offered like okay I'll cover it but only

467.819 --> 471.509
if you first burn the roof down but

469.889 --> 473.46000000000004
that's gonna cost more that's fine I'll

471.509 --> 479.449
cover it but I just want to see it

473.46 --> 484.19899999999996
burden for once you know that conspiracy

479.449 --> 488.31
well yeah who knows and of course Alex

484.199 --> 493.05
Jones and a lot of politicized media are

488.31 --> 495.24
completely enveloping the whole Muslim

493.05 --> 498.24
angle to it and all these Muslims

495.24 --> 501.78000000000003
responding in a shameless way because it

498.24 --> 504.66
is a judeo-christian Church you know

501.78 --> 507.38
the endless I predicted it would happen

504.66 --> 507.38000000000005
and it happened

515.73 --> 521.76
right eye level awakening from what I've

518.55 --> 527.1899999999999
heard there was a billionaire that

521.76 --> 530.9399999999999
basically donated a quarter of a of a

527.19 --> 534.3800000000001
billion dollars no a third third of a

530.94 --> 534.3800000000001
billion yet a lot

545.439 --> 552.4989999999999
why'd Juan Carlos look I have a theory

549.649 --> 554.329
another theory theories all over the

552.499 --> 559.6700000000001
place that's just speculation by the way

554.329 --> 563.689
but I think that the creators of this

559.67 --> 569.899
building it was in a time when there was

563.689 --> 572.54
a lot of friction and it was pretty much

569.899 --> 575.809
right after the Crusades were over or or

572.54 --> 579.29
when they started in that period so they

575.809 --> 582.05
probably expected like yeah it could

579.29 --> 586.73
just happen that we're gonna be stormed

582.05 --> 589.3689999999999
by Muslims or yeah what happened back

586.73 --> 592.22
then so they built it in a way that it

589.369 --> 594.35
couldn't be so easily destroyed and they

592.22 --> 595.749
didn't have any explosives back dang it

594.35 --> 598.879
as far as I remember

595.749 --> 601.279
so they just built a lot of it in stone

598.879 --> 603.679
and expected like yeah if they're gonna

601.279 --> 606.889
burn it okay it'll burn down a part of

603.679 --> 609.019
it but yeah we could repair it so they

606.889 --> 611.66
had the foresight to designed in a way

609.019 --> 614.54
that it could take a fire and not be

611.66 --> 620.24
completely destroyed as part of the

614.54 --> 623.299
design so maybe the Templars and their

620.24 --> 625.399
designers foresaw something like this it

623.299 --> 631.249
just happened to happen a few hundred

625.399 --> 633.999
years laters instead of right then so

631.249 --> 633.999
yeah

637.42 --> 642.4499999999999
it's just an idea I don't know what you

639.76 --> 642.45
guys think about it

645.1 --> 648.57
[Music]

652.74 --> 660.639
[Music]

655.439 --> 663.939
right look it is again it this is super

660.639 --> 666.12
annoying it is bad it is painful how

663.939 --> 670.689
government is treating it in the media

666.12 --> 674.47
but at least technically it's not lost

670.689 --> 676.3
forever that's what I'm looking at and

674.47 --> 685.6
trying to look at the positive side of

676.3 --> 694.3889999999999
this all right Juan Carlos gunpowder has

685.6 --> 695.1700000000001
been around but look right in a way

694.389 --> 697.72
you're right

695.17 --> 699.67
they could have technique like yeah if

697.72 --> 702.009
they'd stack the whole all the towers

699.67 --> 706.389
and everything in the basis with giant

702.009 --> 711.389
kegs of gunpowder okay they could have

706.389 --> 711.389
technically blown it up but

713.87 --> 722.54
it's just it's not as likely as just

717.71 --> 724.3100000000001
setting it on fire you know doing

722.54 --> 728.24
something like that would be a total

724.31 --> 729.8
active demolition you couldn't just do

728.24 --> 731.57
that on the run you couldn't storm the

729.8 --> 734.75
city and just blow it up like that

731.57 --> 736.97
without possible interference ruining

734.75 --> 742.55
the plan blowing your army up that is

736.97 --> 744.71
trying to do that so yeah of course it

742.55 --> 747.17
even then it could technically have been

744.71 --> 753.95
destroyed but only if yeah France was

747.17 --> 758.81
just completely taken over but that

753.95 --> 761.3900000000001
didn't happen and whether that's gonna

758.81 --> 763.78
happen in the 21st century remains to be

761.39 --> 763.78
seen

778.59 --> 784.5600000000001
right leb maybe maybe they're gonna scam

782.279 --> 786.35
all over the place you know it's the

784.56 --> 789.81
perfect opportunity to just disappear

786.35 --> 794.88
articles and declare them fire-damaged

789.81 --> 797.3699999999999
and and just use it as a as a scam to

794.88 --> 799.26
disappear precious things and put them

797.37 --> 802.11
on the black market yeah of course

799.26 --> 806.61
of course all of that could happen all

802.11 --> 811.29
of it it's gonna be a mess any way you

806.61 --> 815.25
slice it but technically it can be

811.29 --> 817.17
restored fully even though they would

815.25 --> 822.089
have to basically replicate certain

817.17 --> 825.5889999999999
things and they might do that as long as

822.089 --> 835.86
the beauty is just like the original

825.589 --> 837.5100000000001
eventually that's my concern mostly yeah

835.86 --> 840.29
Daniel I did

837.51 --> 840.29
watch Game of Thrones

843.06 --> 854.9699999999999
haha Wow LEP that is you might have dug

851.97 --> 858.33
up a box there yeah you may be right on

854.97 --> 864.62
target it may be just right on target he

858.33 --> 864.62
may have actually done it like that yeah

871.44 --> 877.8100000000001
the funny thing is it's also it's just

875.11 --> 881.6800000000001
this these people are our money obsessed

877.81 --> 884.2299999999999
and making scams and in a way if you

881.68 --> 887.709
think about it and this is just this is

884.23 --> 891.22
pure moneymaker thought evil basically

887.709 --> 893.5
but yeah technically it could be making

891.22 --> 895.6
value because if you disappear these

893.5 --> 897.61
items they'll be on the black market

895.6 --> 903.8100000000001
officially they won't exist but they'll

897.61 --> 906.4590000000001
be worth a lot but in the normal world

903.81 --> 908.529
the official world there will be

906.459 --> 911.649
replicas made and they can do that and

908.529 --> 914.2
it will over be replaced and even though

911.649 --> 917.589
yeah things have damaged it's not the

914.2 --> 922.149
originals anymore maybe but everything

917.589 --> 924.85
as a whole the value will not go down

922.149 --> 926.86
because it is still the not true damn it

924.85 --> 929.98
even has an extra history it's still

926.86 --> 933.19
restored and yeah it's not gonna really

929.98 --> 934.12
detract in value too much I think I

933.19 --> 936.7600000000001
don't know

934.12 --> 941.14
so it could even be kind of creating

936.76 --> 951.37
value but yeah that's money scammers

941.14 --> 953.77
thinking huh well Ali B I'm not too sure

951.37 --> 959.279
about that if you can write it off with

953.77 --> 962.68
his taxes not too sure about that maybe

959.279 --> 969.42
look it's France so France is

962.68 --> 969.42
notoriously corrupt with their oligarchy

973.8 --> 978.56
[Music]

975.699 --> 980.209
while Cleary maybe it was the Hunchback

978.56 --> 983.199
that lit the fire in the first place

980.209 --> 983.199
ever considered that

1007.12 --> 1012.659
anyway ya didn't

1009.47 --> 1012.659
[Music]

1016.209 --> 1022.0
I'm run out of subject concerning the

1018.61 --> 1024.3600000000001
Nutter Dam it is still widely going and

1022.0 --> 1026.589
there's so many angles to it and the

1024.36 --> 1030.76
politicization or the political

1026.589 --> 1032.9189999999999
narratives are all getting into it and

1030.76 --> 1034.569
the left is all censoring all over the

1032.919 --> 1038.23
place kind of like Christchurch

1034.569 --> 1041.35
situation you can't question that it is

1038.23 --> 1043.839
just natural causes no examination

1041.35 --> 1047.829
it's terrible they need to just get

1043.839 --> 1050.11
forensics in there it's they did exactly

1047.829 --> 1052.2
the opposite of what I wanted it's

1050.11 --> 1058.059
really aggravating

1052.2 --> 1060.19
but yeah the possibilities are

1058.059 --> 1062.73
widespread but there is a big chance

1060.19 --> 1065.41
that especially because the money

1062.73 --> 1069.54
immediately came rolling in that there

1065.41 --> 1069.5400000000002
is just like a fire insurance

1070.32 --> 1082.059
maybe indeed art swindle scam going on

1075.27 --> 1087.24
could be I wouldn't put you had these

1082.059 --> 1087.24
these people beneath doing that really

1092.0 --> 1094.54
it

1103.64 --> 1114.75
mmm I reckon Angie repins here again

1108.84 --> 1116.55
Cleary it is doable yeah there should be

1114.75 --> 1119.28
some kind of trade some kind of sighting

1116.55 --> 1121.08
of such a device a helicopter would be

1119.28 --> 1122.3999999999999
the first thing I would be thinking of

1121.08 --> 1125.6999999999998
so yeah

1122.4 --> 1128.3600000000001
was there a helicopter seen in the

1125.7 --> 1131.76
vicinity right before the fire started

1128.36 --> 1135.03
it should not be too hard to find

1131.76 --> 1137.1
records of this so if you think it's

1135.03 --> 1141.81
directed energy weapons then either a

1137.1 --> 1145.5
sighting of some kind of police tank or

1141.81 --> 1149.1599999999999
what is it the mobile infantry vehicle

1145.5 --> 1152.18
with a strange device on it or a

1149.16 --> 1154.74
helicopter with a straight device in it

1152.18 --> 1158.8500000000001
it must have been sighted somehow

1154.74 --> 1160.47
someplace so yeah

1158.85 --> 1163.83
if you think it's directed energy

1160.47 --> 1169.53
weapons that's how you find out if it

1163.83 --> 1171.8
could have been so yeah good luck with

1169.53 --> 1171.8
the search

1172.96 --> 1177.45
[Music]

1174.68 --> 1180.6200000000001
and don't try to drown in just people

1177.45 --> 1182.76
talking about the possibility of it

1180.62 --> 1185.76
because of course there's a lot of

1182.76 --> 1187.62
people gonna think that but how many

1185.76 --> 1192.15
people are actually gonna be finding

1187.62 --> 1194.58
clues because there that is where you

1192.15 --> 1196.8500000000001
really find the truth or leads to the

1194.58 --> 1196.85
truth

1202.909 --> 1207.979
bill gee I don't know I don't think so

1229.47 --> 1241.929
hello mind-warped doing good again

1238.63 --> 1247.5700000000002
relieved that the Nutri dom is not

1241.929 --> 1250.0900000000001
irreversibly destroyed just damaged so

1247.57 --> 1254.34
it's a great probability it'll probably

1250.09 --> 1257.1689999999999
be fully restored to original state

1254.34 --> 1258.0
within may we're probably within a

1257.169 --> 1261.41
decade

1258.0 --> 1264.64
if the repairs are given ago

1261.41 --> 1264.64
[Music]

1275.84 --> 1278.5
yeah

1282.399 --> 1290.57
well I wouldn't be surprised hon Carlos

1286.149 --> 1293.36
because France is famous for its drinks

1290.57 --> 1296.33
and that Fame spreads far and wide and

1293.36 --> 1298.4289999999999
people will want to order drinks from

1296.33 --> 1301.97
France so I'm not surprised it's a giant

1298.429 --> 1305.779
vineyard and don't know about the

1301.97 --> 1307.76
tobacco though maybe maybe they do it

1305.779 --> 1314.779
for the local because I think that most

1307.76 --> 1316.94
about comes from is it from tropical

1314.779 --> 1322.6
lands because they just grow so much

1316.94 --> 1322.6000000000001
better their tropical regions

1361.85 --> 1375.1399999999999
well what do you mean they took off you

1369.05 --> 1377.08
I don't get it twelve hundred thousand

1375.14 --> 1383.69
pounds

1377.08 --> 1386.5
what did were you smuggling it it's a

1383.69 --> 1386.5
weird thing to say

1391.76 --> 1394.96
[Music]

1401.12 --> 1408.37
[Music]

1404.03 --> 1411.41
ah so yeah confiscation government

1408.37 --> 1413.53
bureaucracy [ __ ] that really sucks

1411.41 --> 1413.53
man

1427.82 --> 1440.489
[Music]

1430.95 --> 1442.289
oh yeah another note I don't know if how

1440.489 --> 1445.259
many of you have followed the Flat Earth

1442.289 --> 1447.71
debates yesterday the guy came up I

1445.259 --> 1452.669
don't even remember his name it was new

1447.71 --> 1457.679
had a long discussion and afterwards he

1452.669 --> 1461.3400000000001
was technically objecting to us flat

1457.679 --> 1466.0800000000002
earthers using the word obstruction as

1461.34 --> 1468.809
opposing to curvature because and this

1466.08 --> 1471.509
is technically I was kind of annoyed by

1468.809 --> 1473.1
this at first because he said okay you

1471.509 --> 1476.58
can't use the word obstruction because

1473.1 --> 1478.7099999999998
per definition it implies something

1476.58 --> 1481.559
being in front of something else and

1478.71 --> 1485.1290000000001
that is technically geometrically

1481.559 --> 1486.809
incorrect and was really confusing so

1485.129 --> 1492.269
okay what do we call it limited viewing

1486.809 --> 1495.149
angle how do you can you just think of

1492.269 --> 1496.679
one word to replace it with otherwise

1495.149 --> 1498.33
you're gonna have to like spout out the

1496.679 --> 1501.0900000000001
entire sentences every time you

1498.33 --> 1502.9499999999998
reference it that's really annoying but

1501.09 --> 1507.1789999999999
we couldn't come up with one well I did

1502.95 --> 1509.46
I did come up with one and I'm pretty

1507.179 --> 1512.429
proud that I did although it's it seems

1509.46 --> 1516.21
so basic it's not even that special but

1512.429 --> 1518.3400000000001
yeah I I still haven't gotten any

1516.21 --> 1521.19
feedback on this because I just figured

1518.34 --> 1525.2389999999998
it out not even an hour ago but I think

1521.19 --> 1527.3690000000001
that henceforth we should be calling

1525.239 --> 1531.059
what we have formally been calling

1527.369 --> 1534.6589999999999
obstruction we should now refer to that

1531.059 --> 1539.389
as concealment because that is

1534.659 --> 1544.2890000000002
technically correct it's one word and

1539.389 --> 1547.2589999999998
it's basically the same effect but

1544.289 --> 1550.98
without suggesting an object being in

1547.259 --> 1552.45
front of it so it's just consuming it's

1550.98 --> 1556.919
just

1552.45 --> 1560.82
taken out of sight so it's consuming and

1556.919 --> 1563.039
the lower part of an object in the

1560.82 --> 1567.96
distance is not obstructed it's

1563.039 --> 1571.369
concealed so concealment yeah I'm

1567.96 --> 1576.049
actually gonna call this hangout

1571.369 --> 1576.049
concealment because it should

1588.47 --> 1591.64
[Music]

1598.17 --> 1602.8400000000001
yet don't get ridiculous please

1603.88 --> 1606.959
[Music]

1625.94 --> 1635.03
anyway I am first thing at midterm live

1630.94 --> 1639.02
and I will try to call it that until

1635.03 --> 1641.42
something better is suggested it's gonna

1639.02 --> 1643.76
be switched because I as a reflex call

1641.42 --> 1646.1000000000001
it obstruction because I've been calling

1643.76 --> 1651.8
it that so many times but I will try to

1646.1 --> 1653.1799999999998
now switch to concealment something is

1651.8 --> 1656.21
not being obstructed it's being

1653.18 --> 1658.99
concealed it is not obstruction it is

1656.21 --> 1658.99
concealment

1662.02 --> 1668.87
right the atmospheric interference the

1665.99 --> 1673.52
blurring that is technically obstruction

1668.87 --> 1674.87
it's a different effect the haziness you

1673.52 --> 1677.15
can actually call that obstruction

1674.87 --> 1683.9599999999998
because it is the view is literally

1677.15 --> 1689.75
being obstructed by the by the the

1683.96 --> 1692.77
diffusing qualities of the air so it's

1689.75 --> 1692.77
being obstructed by it

1704.399 --> 1709.9899999999998
right called concealment call it an

1707.049 --> 1713.08
apparent displacement but yeah the

1709.99 --> 1717.3990000000001
horizon effect that can be multiple

1713.08 --> 1719.1399999999999
layered by the way but that effect yeah

1717.399 --> 1725.0189999999998
if you compare it to things in the

1719.14 --> 1728.8500000000001
background and things drop away they're

1725.019 --> 1728.85
not obstructed they're concealed

1746.19 --> 1759.78
God stops cap Singh hmm it's really

1751.65 --> 1764.3300000000002
annoying yeah I've been watching some

1759.78 --> 1770.34
next Netflix myself I've gone through

1764.33 --> 1772.74
the series the Outlander or Outlander

1770.34 --> 1777.78
went completely through that and just

1772.74 --> 1781.32
watched a couple of movies I see black

1777.78 --> 1783.8999999999999
summer being forwarded as a suggestion a

1781.32 --> 1787.29
lot I haven't watched it yet I don't

1783.9 --> 1791.7800000000002
really like all that military current

1787.29 --> 1791.78
day stuff a lot

1791.84 --> 1799.59
had I been watching wish he everything

1797.25 --> 1803.27
was a little bit more better to over

1799.59 --> 1803.27
seeds become a little messy oh yeah

1803.57 --> 1809.1799999999998
timeless yeah I've been there's the

1806.22 --> 1813.45
second season of that and watching that

1809.18 --> 1816.51
it's new they are compared to the

1813.45 --> 1817.46
Outlander it's it's really a waste of my

1816.51 --> 1821.31
time

1817.46 --> 1825.66
the social interactions are kind of

1821.31 --> 1828.84
boring to me but the dressing up and I

1825.66 --> 1830.91
don't know the storyline is kind of its

1828.84 --> 1835.9099999999999
kind of okay so far it might get a lot

1830.91 --> 1835.91
better I don't know let's see

1835.96 --> 1843.0900000000001
[Music]

1837.92 --> 1844.98
yeah but I'm just scouring around in

1843.09 --> 1845.82
Netflix to see if I can find something

1844.98 --> 1848.13
interesting

1845.82 --> 1849.84
oh yeah I watched Life of Brian the

1848.13 --> 1856.8200000000002
other day as well or finished watching

1849.84 --> 1862.31
it in three parts also the movie silence

1856.82 --> 1868.4399999999998
that was really interesting this crazy

1862.31 --> 1870.3899999999999
Patera Nadar yep a Pteranodon vampire

1868.44 --> 1873.1200000000001
bats Oh

1870.39 --> 1878.13
oh yeah and I almost forgot I randomly

1873.12 --> 1878.3999999999999
clicked watch the movie what's it called

1878.13 --> 1881.97
again

1878.4 --> 1886.5900000000001
Oh at the cave wow that was such a D&D

1881.97 --> 1889.95
inspiration my god I loved it like a

1886.59 --> 1893.1899999999998
cave with all these crazy subterranean

1889.95 --> 1895.6200000000001
monsters and there was like this virus

1893.19 --> 1897.42
or disease or parasites and if you

1895.62 --> 1901.4399999999998
caught it then you would turn like into

1897.42 --> 1903.69
a you would golem of I basically it's I

1901.44 --> 1906.72
don't know it was a really interesting

1903.69 --> 1910.44
movie the cave it was kind of action

1906.72 --> 1916.17
horror II it wasn't super spectacular

1910.44 --> 1919.68
but the sights were amazing and just the

1916.17 --> 1920.27
setting I had a real atmospheric thing

1919.68 --> 1923.54
to it

1920.27 --> 1923.54
really interesting

1930.07 --> 1937.02
anyway yeah enough Netflix no not seen

1934.54 --> 1937.02
troll hunter

1961.5 --> 1964.69
[Music]

1970.6 --> 1977.3899999999999
anyway yeah the movie the cave for me

1974.0 --> 1981.32
was fascinating because I like in D&D

1977.39 --> 1984.7700000000002
caves are very appealing to work with as

1981.32 --> 1988.28
a game master you can really create an

1984.77 --> 1991.18
atmosphere that is easy to sketch out in

1988.28 --> 1994.79
kind of a top-down autographic view and

1991.18 --> 1996.77
you can just describe it roughly and how

1994.79 --> 1998.8999999999999
much lighting there is and smell and

1996.77 --> 2001.36
everything and people can really get

1998.9 --> 2004.96
into that very quickly it's much less

2001.36 --> 2010.03
difficult as imagining a town and its

2004.96 --> 2012.67
activities much more complex and I have

2010.03 --> 2015.55
a lot of cave adventure so just to see

2012.67 --> 2018.79
it in a movie like that it was awesome

2015.55 --> 2023.59
I really liked I thought it was really

2018.79 --> 2027.43
cool I was like cave diving cave

2023.59 --> 2031.4199999999998
climbing and weird alien bat-like

2027.43 --> 2036.7
creatures and also Giants like giant

2031.42 --> 2041.28
giant demon bats that were like as big

2036.7 --> 2044.89
as humans man it was really creepy ass

2041.28 --> 2048.75
sometimes it was a very thrilling movie

2044.89 --> 2053.05
so if you like thrillers and monster

2048.75 --> 2056.53
monsters and yeah caves and climbing and

2053.05 --> 2058.09
diving yeah this is your movie if you're

2056.53 --> 2061.71
not scared if you yeah if you get

2058.09 --> 2065.82
claustrophobic don't watch this movie I

2061.71 --> 2065.82
do not recommend it

2067.929 --> 2071.119
[Music]

2075.99 --> 2082.6189999999997
mmm-hmm cool bill G okay should say it's

2080.25 --> 2086.359
good I will see if I can find troll

2082.619 --> 2086.359
enter sometime maybe it is good

2099.06 --> 2104.18
uh yeah this is getting kind of boring

2109.01 --> 2112.9500000000003
yeah

2110.25 --> 2116.85
although the D&D tie-in it's very

2112.95 --> 2121.5899999999997
typical because I have been quite making

2116.85 --> 2128.5699999999997
new plans progression in the giant story

2121.59 --> 2131.7000000000003
arc new factions in the kingdom of which

2128.57 --> 2134.4900000000002
yet to which the town that the players

2131.7 --> 2136.95
are a center that is tied in to as like

2134.49 --> 2139.6499999999996
an outpost so been going into that but

2136.95 --> 2141.5099999999998
the others just a lot of meta talk it's

2139.65 --> 2146.4500000000003
not too interesting other than that flat

2141.51 --> 2149.0400000000004
earth related beyond the upstream

2146.45 --> 2152.49
concealment formerly known as

2149.04 --> 2155.0099999999998
obstruction there's not much news that I

2152.49 --> 2157.5899999999997
can bring except for Globus are really

2155.01 --> 2162.21
freaking annoying and liars and Cognex

2157.59 --> 2164.9700000000003
dissonant to their own lies and they do

2162.21 --> 2169.08
it for religious causes and it's really

2164.97 --> 2171.1499999999996
freaking annoying and also because they

2169.08 --> 2174.45
pretend it doesn't happen and then still

2171.15 --> 2181.29
claim honor it is so two-faced and

2174.45 --> 2186.33
disgusting it is repugnant and vile the

2181.29 --> 2188.99
way they conduct themselves so other

2186.33 --> 2188.99
than that no

2190.83 --> 2194.4
[Music]

2197.18 --> 2200.62
[Music]

2200.92 --> 2204.1
all right

2215.98 --> 2222.4900000000002
no thanks Juan Carlos but both of those

2219.16 --> 2225.94
sounds like more post-apocalyptic zombie

2222.49 --> 2229.72
[ __ ] and I'm sick of zombie movies I've

2225.94 --> 2232.9
seen so many freaking zombie movies and

2229.72 --> 2237.8489999999997
series and I'm just done with it I hate

2232.9 --> 2241.6600000000003
zombies I hate people that are zombies

2237.849 --> 2245.8900000000003
and I hate zombie movies and I don't

2241.66 --> 2248.71
like dressing up as zombies either you

2245.89 --> 2251.5
know I was sort of with that in my own

2248.71 --> 2254.109
way I would rather like dress up as like

2251.5 --> 2256.93
a litter of something so I'm kind of and

2254.109 --> 2259.8089999999997
that source or whatever that would have

2256.93 --> 2263.3489999999997
been good that was cool in the gothic

2259.809 --> 2264.3590000000004
age in my life and with dress-up

2263.349 --> 2269.349
thingies

2264.359 --> 2271.93
Shmi makeup stuff but no zombies like

2269.349 --> 2274.21
being yeah there's like zombie walks in

2271.93 --> 2275.95
the gothic scene apparently in Amsterdam

2274.21 --> 2279.25
and New York and [ __ ]

2275.95 --> 2281.74
people like shrink like zombies and just

2279.25 --> 2284.589
go on a parade with that act like

2281.74 --> 2287.95
zombies it's ridiculous it's kind of

2284.589 --> 2298.2599999999998
funny but I'm just sick of it I'm sick

2287.95 --> 2298.2599999999998
of zombies zombies stink you know

2303.12 --> 2306.3399999999997
[Music]

2312.3 --> 2318.7200000000003
you know PJ please speak for yourself I

2319.53 --> 2327.48
am no zombie i reanimated

2336.43 --> 2344.43
or rather resurrected I didn't reanimate

2339.64 --> 2349.2
I resurrect it that's weird d indeed

2344.43 --> 2353.609
terminology you can like right yeah

2349.2 --> 2356.2599999999998
basically animates a dead figure that's

2353.609 --> 2360.64
necromancy and then they turn to that

2356.26 --> 2363.6400000000003
like a zombie or you can literally and

2360.64 --> 2369.339
that's much more difficult and expensive

2363.64 --> 2372.7599999999998
magic reah raise them from the dead and

2369.339 --> 2376.839
then they become alive again usually

2372.76 --> 2377.4700000000003
with some penalty so yeah I am NOT a

2376.839 --> 2382.42
zombie

2377.47 --> 2384.279
I wasn't animated if you presume that

2382.42 --> 2386.579
we've all been dead then I've been

2384.279 --> 2386.579
raised

2391.59 --> 2408.2200000000003
so let's not get too ridiculous with

2394.87 --> 2410.17
this God the rapture I can't believe

2408.22 --> 2416.22
anyone in the world still believes in

2410.17 --> 2416.2200000000003
the rapture it's just ridiculous

2439.65 --> 2445.27
right so I mean I'm thinking about

2443.47 --> 2450.7
something and I'll just gonna put it

2445.27 --> 2452.86
forward and that is that I don't know

2450.7 --> 2457.45
maybe you find this ridiculous maybe not

2452.86 --> 2462.9700000000003
I have a lot of trouble believing the

2457.45 --> 2469.5899999999997
end times in the Bible a lot of trouble

2462.97 --> 2469.5899999999997
with it although because

2476.579 --> 2482.699
I don't know there's like these accurate

2479.299 --> 2485.489
systems descriptions of things happening

2482.699 --> 2488.819
that can definitely be correlated but I

2485.489 --> 2491.029
think that the Bible and that thing that

2488.819 --> 2494.9
was written a long time ago

2491.029 --> 2498.569
was rather used as an inspiration source

2494.9 --> 2500.9990000000003
by the elites so I think it's a

2498.569 --> 2503.0389999999998
self-fulfilling prophecy they're

2500.999 --> 2505.499
creating it in their own way they're

2503.039 --> 2510.0890000000004
they're riding upon the mechanism of it

2505.499 --> 2514.499
that they recognize they interpreted it

2510.089 --> 2516.15
and then they adapted their development

2514.499 --> 2521.66
to it that's what I think it has

2516.15 --> 2521.6600000000003
happened and I don't I think it is a I

2526.549 --> 2533.689
don't think reality follows in the

2529.559 --> 2539.219
tracts of the Bible I think the Bible

2533.689 --> 2541.41
was used as an example so in a way I

2539.219 --> 2543.539
don't know I've just so much trouble

2541.41 --> 2545.16
thinking that that is what the Bible the

2543.539 --> 2547.5490000000004
end times is what the Bible is really

2545.16 --> 2547.549
about

2557.28 --> 2563.619
maybe it's just me and my lack of

2561.67 --> 2566.91
comprehension of it all because I

2563.619 --> 2570.2200000000003
haven't really read through it all ever

2566.91 --> 2572.47
read fragments of it hurt a lot of it

2570.22 --> 2575.08
have been taught about other people and

2572.47 --> 2578.5899999999997
their interpretation and drew my own

2575.08 --> 2580.93
conclusions from what was said and I

2578.59 --> 2583.69
believe about that the path of Christ

2580.93 --> 2590.5
and following his example and I think

2583.69 --> 2595.18
that is really it throughout it all and

2590.5 --> 2600.369
I I just don't believe the end times

2595.18 --> 2602.77
predictions as literal as it they're

2600.369 --> 2606.58
making it literal but I don't think it

2602.77 --> 2610.29
was originally literal I think it was

2606.58 --> 2615.43
originally truly a vision in the future

2610.29 --> 2617.65
but so much has happened since then that

2615.43 --> 2623.3799999999997
I was bound to change it and then

2617.65 --> 2626.14
eventually the way things went was just

2623.38 --> 2632.23
adapted to that original vision that's

2626.14 --> 2634.27
how I think it's really going on so it I

2632.23 --> 2636.2400000000002
don't think it really was inevitable

2634.27 --> 2639.25
they're just making it like that

2636.24 --> 2641.58
probably to reinforce a lot of momentum

2639.25 --> 2644.91
within religions

2641.58 --> 2648.4
originally based or tied in with those

2644.91 --> 2649.6189999999997
writings and those predictions it's very

2648.4 --> 2653.5
complex

2649.619 --> 2659.98
probably the Bible is a

2653.5 --> 2663.28
multi-dimensional book so I am NOT I

2659.98 --> 2669.9
like I in a way reject the end times

2663.28 --> 2674.26
I don't ignore it but I'm not gonna be

2669.9 --> 2680.82
going with the doom aspect of it I'm

2674.26 --> 2680.82
rather taking it as a an overemphasized

2684.44 --> 2690.7200000000003
warning it's just like okay if this [ __ ]

2688.109 --> 2692.609
goes on you got to be careful with it

2690.72 --> 2695.4599999999996
that's all don't you don't have to

2692.609 --> 2697.2599999999998
freakin panic you don't have to just

2695.46 --> 2699.45
focus on that everything is going to be

2697.26 --> 2706.23
destroyed or something even if that is

2699.45 --> 2711.02
at some point said but you gotta be

2706.23 --> 2711.02
vigilant though for practical reasons

2714.2 --> 2722.75
anyway that's just me that's where I'm

2717.56 --> 2725.75
currently at from my eclectic Christian

2722.75 --> 2725.75
perspective

2730.23 --> 2737.5
[Music]

2733.74 --> 2742.2099999999996
no no AGM I'm not saying the earth will

2737.5 --> 2745.48
live forever what I'm saying is is that

2742.21 --> 2747.359
for example to put it in a more defined

2745.48 --> 2751.2400000000002
context which I don't necessarily

2747.359 --> 2753.88
ascribe to right now it could be that

2751.24 --> 2756.3089999999997
the end times will actually happen in

2753.88 --> 2758.02
five hundred years from now because of

2756.309 --> 2760.329
the calendars that have been shifted

2758.02 --> 2762.94
never thought about that and what's

2760.329 --> 2765.51
happening right now is simply the elite

2762.94 --> 2771.369
having so much power that they can just

2765.51 --> 2774.7000000000003
like a spell emulate all of the N timed

2771.369 --> 2777.309
effects through the technology and use

2774.7 --> 2780.3089999999997
the book as an inspiration for their

2777.309 --> 2784.92
program of how they unfold the

2780.309 --> 2784.92
technology that's what I'm saying

2785.819 --> 2795.0099999999998
so it's it could be a fake end times

2789.7 --> 2797.859
they're using the the appeal and and the

2795.01 --> 2800.1400000000003
power of the book to do a fake end times

2797.859 --> 2804.04
that's what I'm saying that could be it

2800.14 --> 2806.77
not saying that it is but that's the few

2804.04 --> 2811.2599999999998
I get of it there is so much fake so

2806.77 --> 2816.119
much is fake not just talking about our

2811.26 --> 2820.6600000000003
terrorist attacks or situations but even

2816.119 --> 2824.46
parts of laws codes of conducts so much

2820.66 --> 2824.46
is Bluff nowadays

2825.16 --> 2834.23
institutionally institutional Bluff so

2831.2 --> 2836.1499999999996
why would you then see as everything is

2834.23 --> 2838.849
suggested to be n times why would you

2836.15 --> 2842.779
believe that if you already know that so

2838.849 --> 2844.9700000000003
much is just fake isn't that just

2842.779 --> 2847.539
convenient to them to be the ultimate

2844.97 --> 2847.5389999999998
doom

2856.95 --> 2860.5
[Music]

2866.66 --> 2873.859
it's like it's almost like for powerful

2871.25 --> 2880.0
people taking on the cloak of the devil

2873.859 --> 2883.22
is like a actually a desperate act a

2880.0 --> 2886.759
desperate act to induce fear to save

2883.22 --> 2889.49
people off but it'll never restore

2886.759 --> 2892.43
things it will only make it worse but

2889.49 --> 2894.8289999999997
it'll postpone things because people are

2892.43 --> 2897.109
in the spell of the fear everything

2894.829 --> 2902.71
that's tied into it it's like a

2897.109 --> 2908.019
desperate final path a final deception

2902.71 --> 2908.0190000000002
to postpone whatever was coming to you

2932.97 --> 2942.2099999999996
yeah or Reno Co womble says starting to

2939.119 --> 2944.4300000000003
sound like David Icke I take that as a

2942.21 --> 2947.76
compliment actually I have a great

2944.43 --> 2955.069
respect for David Icke not so much his

2947.76 --> 2959.55
moon theories but yeah his spiritual

2955.069 --> 2962.31
conceptual metaphysical and about the

2959.55 --> 2964.77
personal code of conduct and personal

2962.31 --> 2966.54
realization all that his teachings I

2964.77 --> 2972.63
find them fantastic and they have been

2966.54 --> 2975.42
very consistent over the decades and I

2972.63 --> 2977.76
greatly respect everything he he went

2975.42 --> 2980.46
through to go there and he's not perfect

2977.76 --> 2985.7700000000004
because he has set like both obvious

2980.46 --> 2988.98
borders cutting yeah polishing the whole

2985.77 --> 2993.569
story just a little bit stave of too

2988.98 --> 2996.03
much friction that is present so like

2993.569 --> 2999.3
almost little commercializing it just a

2996.03 --> 3003.02
little in order to be able to manage it

2999.3 --> 3008.2400000000002
but the overall story lines are very

3003.02 --> 3010.31
persistent and very relevant so I have

3008.24 --> 3012.14
respect for David Icke and I don't mind

3010.31 --> 3015.16
if I sound a little like him as long as

3012.14 --> 3015.16
it makes sense

3027.47 --> 3033.2799999999997
what the hell are you guys saying this

3029.63 --> 3033.28
is said doesn't make any sense to me

3034.15 --> 3041.53
guys are going nuts

3037.75 --> 3041.53
hello chocolates saying

3059.82 --> 3063.17
I got a present

3064.46 --> 3074.2400000000002
I hate that they compacted the emoticon

3071.05 --> 3076.1000000000004
book so you have to search much harder

3074.24 --> 3082.3599999999997
to find something I find that very

3076.1 --> 3082.36
annoying there you go

3084.58 --> 3093.7599999999998
yep don't threat on me

3089.05 --> 3093.76
don't threat on me little mouse

3098.24 --> 3101.4599999999996
[Music]

3121.07 --> 3131.3300000000004
tread thread sorry treads stupid don't

3129.71 --> 3135.13
tread on me

3131.33 --> 3135.13
this is Mouse all right

3160.44 --> 3168.9500000000003
yeah if saying don't thread on me is

3163.47 --> 3168.95
like okay don't write on my skin please

3169.19 --> 3173.39
get that pan away from me

3191.069 --> 3201.55
see okay Nathan's as a panelling so

3196.78 --> 3208.02
there will be debates good good to know

3201.55 --> 3208.02
why I will bring up my concealment

3209.25 --> 3215.13
word to replace obstruction with

3221.91 --> 3227.219
[Music]

3230.62 --> 3236.88
you guys always go ballistic in my chat

3233.38 --> 3236.88
it's just weird to see

3252.68 --> 3259.009
Oh God

3254.63 --> 3262.819
Michael Roth yeah thanks all the

3259.009 --> 3266.63
different people types that's just great

3262.819 --> 3270.68
yeah I can't wait to get everyone's

3266.63 --> 3276.549
judgment on what what part of the Greek

3270.68 --> 3276.549
alphabet I am on can't wait for it

3281.72 --> 3287.6499999999996
although I'm pretty sure I'm not an

3284.06 --> 3292.82
alpha well I wanna be but yeah that's

3287.65 --> 3297.619
wanting to be an alpha is not it's not

3292.82 --> 3300.17
the typical aspect of an alpha I'd

3297.619 --> 3303.32
classify myself probably as a beta more

3300.17 --> 3310.79
as a typical natural assistant I thrive

3303.32 --> 3313.31
in when I'm doing things together with

3310.79 --> 3319.04
other people I thrive a lot the energy

3313.31 --> 3322.13
connections I just work better unless I

3319.04 --> 3324.619
am like very heavily driven in something

3322.13 --> 3327.1400000000003
then yeah absolutely I can do incredible

3324.619 --> 3329.59
things on my own but there's to be

3327.14 --> 3337.2799999999997
something incredible inspiring me

3329.59 --> 3339.23
usually something female related that's

3337.28 --> 3343.4300000000003
the only time I really experience that

3339.23 --> 3351.79
can be in the form of art or building

3343.43 --> 3351.79
something but all right

3355.39 --> 3363.43
yeah yeah from everything I've heard

3358.48 --> 3366.52
from gammas and yeah Owen Benjamin talks

3363.43 --> 3369.6699999999996
about this a lot these days we used all

3366.52 --> 3372.91
called beta male blah but beta is not

3369.67 --> 3377.17
really the correct description for the

3372.91 --> 3379.2
weedy boys and the [ __ ] and they

3377.17 --> 3383.28
apparently are called gammas

3379.2 --> 3394.1499999999996
passive-aggressive surrender ists

3383.28 --> 3402.28
backstabbing dicks and there's a lot of

3394.15 --> 3405.64
those these days you know me I don't

3402.28 --> 3410.6800000000003
know I think that among men I tend to be

3405.64 --> 3414.0
beta but with and properly reinforced

3410.68 --> 3418.1499999999996
with the female I will absolutely try to

3414.0 --> 3425.64
somehow claim alpha or learn how to do

3418.15 --> 3425.64
it absolutely my own I don't know

3439.68 --> 3444.41
right I didn't make yeah

3447.4 --> 3453.4900000000002
there's it's a weird thing look it all

3451.749 --> 3456.249
depends on the type of relation I guess

3453.49 --> 3458.529
but I've had relations and I would never

3456.249 --> 3460.749
let ya my girlfriend

3458.529 --> 3462.91
cockney in front of other people like

3460.749 --> 3466.72
talk down to me not that I would get

3462.91 --> 3470.519
really like punishing or something but I

3466.72 --> 3475.3489999999997
either get really snide and instantly

3470.519 --> 3480.1299999999997
trick her verbally as it were or trick

3475.349 --> 3482.1400000000003
what she's saying to distract it I'm not

3480.13 --> 3485.4100000000003
just gonna take that like oh yeah I'm a

3482.14 --> 3488.47
man of course of course I will have to

3485.41 --> 3490.839
be talked down upon by my female never I

3488.47 --> 3492.4599999999996
can't stand that [ __ ] and every time I

3490.839 --> 3495.4
see it happen with somebody else I'm

3492.46 --> 3499.599
like dude are you just gonna let her

3495.4 --> 3504.5190000000002
talk like that without at least a very

3499.599 --> 3506.7400000000002
very smart ass male response to save

3504.519 --> 3509.2889999999998
face somewhat and get a neutral ground

3506.74 --> 3510.999
again come on you can't you can't let

3509.289 --> 3516.2990000000004
yourself be cocked left-hand a public

3510.999 --> 3519.91
dude and happened so many times I guess

3516.299 --> 3524.14
and look if my girlfriend is really

3519.91 --> 3528.3689999999997
freaking hot I will just absolutely in

3524.14 --> 3533.249
public try to claim alpha just because I

3528.369 --> 3537.789
got something to alpha protect you know

3533.249 --> 3539.589
but I'm talking way too much about

3537.789 --> 3547.7490000000003
relationship conduct when I'm actually

3539.589 --> 3550.96
not in a relation just shows you where

3547.749 --> 3553.5589999999997
my mind is that it's spring its spring

3550.96 --> 3553.559
