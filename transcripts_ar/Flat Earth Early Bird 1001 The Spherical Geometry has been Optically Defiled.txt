6.16 --> 37.45
[Music]

49.84 --> 54.0
good

51.199 --> 56.718999999999994
morning welcome to flat earth early bird

54.0 --> 59.039
number 1001

56.719 --> 61.199
i'm your host irwin and before we start

59.039 --> 63.760000000000005
the show please don't forget to share it

61.199 --> 65.84
on any platform you deem fit and if you

63.76 --> 67.84
haven't already subscribe to my channel

65.84 --> 70.479
and hit the bell notification so you

67.84 --> 73.04
know i'm going live which is normally 1

70.479 --> 75.36
pm amsterdam time and weekdays and 2 p.m

73.04 --> 77.84
amsterdam time in the weekend and please

75.36 --> 79.92
also do support me through the paypal

77.84 --> 82.0
patreon crypto wallet super chat and the

79.92 --> 85.96000000000001
membership system join button

82.0 --> 85.96
that would be much appreciated

87.28 --> 92.32000000000001
so

89.119 --> 92.32
today the weather is

92.4 --> 98.159
a continuation of yesterday

95.68 --> 101.84
even better actually there's almost no

98.159 --> 101.84
clouds this time

103.119 --> 108.079
and just nice bright sun

106.079 --> 110.88
no trails but it is

108.079 --> 113.19999999999999
it's slightly hazy

110.88 --> 116.64
but i think it's just natural

113.2 --> 116.64
from the moist in the air

117.2 --> 123.68
that plane flying there in distance

120.159 --> 123.68
but not leaving a trail

123.92 --> 130.64000000000001
only for a very short time

126.88 --> 133.04
right it's not very windy

130.64 --> 136.07999999999998
a little bit sometimes

133.04 --> 139.2
just overall very warm

136.08 --> 139.20000000000002
after summer day

139.84 --> 144.72
interesting

141.52 --> 147.36
so maybe it is going to be

144.72 --> 148.959
a nice after summer this september it's

147.36 --> 151.28
happened before here here in the

148.959 --> 154.16
netherlands

151.28 --> 154.16
it's very nice

154.84 --> 158.36
hello pokushaidortgoi

158.48 --> 162.16
first in chat good to see you

162.319 --> 164.64
oh

165.28 --> 169.599
you have to catch the show after work

167.44 --> 171.84
all right well thanks for popping by

169.599 --> 171.84
anyway

173.2 --> 176.95899999999997
it is

175.04 --> 180.84
friday the 3rd

176.959 --> 180.84
of september 2021

182.959 --> 186.239
not saturday like i thought

185.36 --> 188.56
this is

186.239 --> 190.31900000000002
at the end of yesterday's show but i did

188.56 --> 192.959
correct it this time

190.319 --> 195.51899999999998
i do that more often it's weird it's

192.959 --> 195.519
really weird

195.599 --> 198.39999999999998
just

196.4 --> 199.84
subtly out of nowhere i assume it's a

198.4 --> 202.56
different day

199.84 --> 205.12
and i don't pick up on it usually until

202.56 --> 206.72
i already ended the show

205.12 --> 208.64000000000001
i'm like what

206.72 --> 211.28
what did i just say

208.64 --> 213.92
it's odd

211.28 --> 215.04
but i corrected it anyway hello moon

213.92 --> 217.76
shadow

215.04 --> 217.76
good to see you

221.36 --> 227.76000000000002
i'll be doing a two hour show today

226.4 --> 230.64000000000001
and

227.76 --> 231.67999999999998
yeah i did give it a title

230.64 --> 234.879
but

231.68 --> 237.36
yeah that's only in reflection on

234.879 --> 241.67999999999998
the flat earth debates yesterday which

237.36 --> 243.84
was a really good long after show

241.68 --> 246.31900000000002
quite intense

243.84 --> 248.64000000000001
and informative

246.319 --> 252.48
we talked like

248.64 --> 256.479
primarily about gas pressure

252.48 --> 258.479
and akuma virus was in there

256.479 --> 261.199
basically

258.479 --> 265.52
being an anti-flat earther about it just

261.199 --> 265.52000000000004
not getting it assuming gas has mass

266.0 --> 270.96
was that yesterday

267.68 --> 270.96
or was that the day before

271.52 --> 274.15999999999997
hold on

274.96 --> 278.88
i'm not sure but i'm pretty sure that

276.8 --> 281.44
yesterday we did

278.88 --> 284.0
much more among the guys elaborately

281.44 --> 286.16
talk about it

284.0 --> 288.32
and was very interesting show can't wait

286.16 --> 292.68
to see it back

288.32 --> 292.68
it's gonna be a good saturday show

296.16 --> 301.28000000000003
hello return to normal ajm good to see

299.12 --> 301.28000000000003
you

307.6 --> 314.16
it's tuesday night no it's not

311.199 --> 314.16
no it's friday

321.6 --> 325.84000000000003
don't know what coma you just got out of

324.08 --> 328.0
tobannoid but

325.84 --> 330.23999999999995
yeah it's definitely not tuesday right

328.0 --> 330.24
now

335.6 --> 338.96000000000004
anyway

337.68 --> 341.28000000000003
been watching

338.96 --> 343.52
november

341.28 --> 343.52
what

350.72 --> 353.72
no

361.84 --> 365.0
all right

369.84 --> 375.84
all right tomorrow you might have

372.0 --> 378.08
accidentally switched medications

375.84 --> 380.479
or something because you ain't making a

378.08 --> 383.35999999999996
lot of sense today

380.479 --> 383.35999999999996
whatever uh

386.08 --> 389.84
yeah watching more owen benjamin

388.24 --> 392.16
yesterday

389.84 --> 395.15999999999997
after the flat earth debates was good

392.16 --> 395.16
stuff

401.44 --> 407.56
met you from australia was live again

404.319 --> 407.56
good stuff

410.479 --> 416.71999999999997
i don't remember if i actually was there

413.12 --> 416.72
in the chat live that time

419.199 --> 423.759
all right

420.479 --> 426.96
i also watched a movie yesterday

423.759 --> 426.96000000000004
one that i seen before

427.759 --> 433.12
uh

429.759 --> 436.8
like the new tomb raider

433.12 --> 439.68
it's it's a pretty good movie

436.8 --> 439.68
i like it

445.12 --> 450.319
right especially because like all the

446.96 --> 452.79999999999995
characters in that movie get portrayed

450.319 --> 455.91900000000004
in a more

452.8 --> 456.8
like physically realistic way despite

455.919 --> 459.19899999999996
like

456.8 --> 460.639
extremities happening adventurous

459.199 --> 461.44
extremities

460.639 --> 465.199
like

461.44 --> 468.16
all the characters like do like visibly

465.199 --> 471.12
and audibly experience pain

468.16 --> 473.44
much more seriously than most like super

471.12 --> 474.56
action movies where they could just take

473.44 --> 476.96
any hit

474.56 --> 479.68
and in here it's

476.96 --> 481.28
you really get like

479.68 --> 484.0
every time like

481.28 --> 486.15999999999997
it's all a little bit more real in a way

484.0 --> 489.919
they did it like that

486.16 --> 489.91900000000004
and it's actually quite appealing

490.639 --> 494.879
most characters in it are also just

495.599 --> 499.919
more real i don't know i thought it was

497.36 --> 502.72
a really good movie anyway

499.919 --> 506.24
i had seen it before and yeah

502.72 --> 507.28000000000003
i remembered it being good and yeah it

506.24 --> 511.039
was

507.28 --> 511.039
anyway hello amanda young

513.039 --> 519.36
i've never seen any of them i don't

516.32 --> 519.36
is there another one

519.76 --> 525.36
i don't know i've only seen the first

522.32 --> 526.88
remake because the original one was like

525.36 --> 528.32
a total mess

526.88 --> 533.56
it was

528.32 --> 533.5600000000001
yeah not received very well at the time

544.88 --> 549.76
yeah yeah that's a nice projection there

547.6 --> 551.6
trolleyboy

549.76 --> 554.3199999999999
it's a nice projection

551.6 --> 556.64
yeah you know i say those things

554.32 --> 559.6800000000001
because i literally don't give a [ __ ]

556.64 --> 562.72
what you think anymore

559.68 --> 564.88
i'm very well willing for you to

562.72 --> 567.2
basically perceive me

564.88 --> 568.48
as whatever worst nightmare you can

567.2 --> 570.9590000000001
imagine

568.48 --> 574.24
being it fallacious

570.959 --> 575.8389999999999
religious whatever i don't care i really

574.24 --> 579.279
don't care

575.839 --> 580.32
right because i have a solid case

579.279 --> 582.88
based on

580.32 --> 582.88
physics

583.12 --> 586.9590000000001
right

584.32 --> 586.9590000000001
you don't

587.12 --> 589.519
none of your

588.48 --> 593.279
fellow

589.519 --> 597.92
globe earth cultist can even answer

593.279 --> 602.079
basic yes or no questions and will spend

597.92 --> 603.5999999999999
hours on end avoiding those specific

602.079 --> 606.64
questions yeah

603.6 --> 611.36
so who's in a cult

606.64 --> 611.36
yeah mr projector projector troll

617.04 --> 621.68
oh really how do you have gas pressure

619.44 --> 624.48
without a container

621.68 --> 624.4799999999999
how does that work

624.64 --> 630.56
let's do the dance huh

627.2 --> 631.6
trolly boy let's do the dance every part

630.56 --> 633.68
of it

631.6 --> 636.16
you do realize i know all the

633.68 --> 638.399
housekeeping questions by heart

636.16 --> 640.64
can emulate them from both baller and

638.399 --> 641.68
anti-flat-earther perspective

640.64 --> 643.8389999999999
and

641.68 --> 646.16
i've pretty much proved myself to know

643.839 --> 649.6800000000001
the arguments from those perspectives

646.16 --> 652.079
better than anybody else out there so i

649.68 --> 655.1999999999999
wish you the best of luck

652.079 --> 655.1999999999999
bunny huh

656.0 --> 661.519
yeah so again

658.8 --> 664.399
let's start with how do you have gas

661.519 --> 669.6
pressure without a container or even

664.399 --> 671.76
better how do you calculate gas pressure

669.6 --> 672.8000000000001
why don't you lay it out for me

671.76 --> 676.64
huh

672.8 --> 679.76
trolley trolleyboy mr projector

676.64 --> 683.92
how do you calculate

679.76 --> 683.92
gas pressure how does that work

685.12 --> 690.24
oh really

687.6 --> 694.32
you calculate

690.24 --> 696.5600000000001
gas pressure with gravity do you

694.32 --> 698.6400000000001
i think you got the wrong physics

696.56 --> 700.16
formula buddy

698.64 --> 703.519
i think you got the wrong physics

700.16 --> 706.48
formula you see g

703.519 --> 709.279
is completely irrelevant to the

706.48 --> 712.8000000000001
calculation of gas pressure

709.279 --> 714.8389999999999
but you don't seem to get that

712.8 --> 718.88
like that move

714.839 --> 722.5600000000001
on to red herrings

718.88 --> 723.4399999999999
and mechanics that are proven blatantly

722.56 --> 727.1999999999999
wrong

723.44 --> 729.2790000000001
because gravity conceptual or otherwise

727.2 --> 731.6800000000001
relative density including right which

729.279 --> 733.6
is really the real gravity what you

731.68 --> 736.0
think is gravity

733.6 --> 737.6
is relative density yeah it doesn't

736.0 --> 739.279
influence

737.6 --> 742.839
gas

739.279 --> 742.8389999999999
it doesn't really

744.16 --> 746.959
did you know that

748.32 --> 751.62
a barometer

750.399 --> 754.679
oh

751.62 --> 754.679
[Music]

757.279 --> 762.24
yeah but um you see

759.839 --> 765.44
it sounds like that

762.24 --> 768.16
but i can actually prove it and i have

765.44 --> 772.48
on a daily basis spending

768.16 --> 775.4399999999999
over a thousand hours at least

772.48 --> 776.32
over a thousand hours specifically doing

775.44 --> 778.8000000000001
that

776.32 --> 782.72
i have a lot of actual

778.8 --> 784.3199999999999
real world evidence to show for it

782.72 --> 788.32
you understand

784.32 --> 788.32
mr projector m

791.68 --> 797.12
so really you call you calculate gas

794.399 --> 800.8
pressure with a barometer oh really so

797.12 --> 803.519
what's the mathematical formula for the

800.8 --> 805.68
barometer calculation

803.519 --> 808.9590000000001
right because i think that the barometer

805.68 --> 812.0
is actually a physical device

808.959 --> 814.16
to size up gas pressure

812.0 --> 817.12
that's not the question i asked the

814.16 --> 820.0
question i asked is how do you calculate

817.12 --> 821.12
it mathematics there's a formula for

820.0 --> 825.16
this

821.12 --> 825.16
do you know what it is

833.68 --> 839.3599999999999
could it be pet spaz

835.92 --> 841.5999999999999
i don't know probably return to normal

839.36 --> 843.839
but yeah indulge them for a bit i'm okay

841.6 --> 846.0
with that

843.839 --> 848.72
i think it's the same squirt boys that

846.0 --> 851.839
were trying to ruin my show yesterday

848.72 --> 852.639
and failed miserably at it may i may i

851.839 --> 856.0790000000001
say

852.639 --> 857.519
since yesterday was a exhilarating great

856.079 --> 860.4799999999999
show

857.519 --> 862.079
it was a lot of fun

860.48 --> 864.9590000000001
and yeah

862.079 --> 864.959
it was really good

869.519 --> 873.839
hey dusty ryder

871.199 --> 873.8389999999999
good to see you

876.24 --> 881.76
the ideal no no no i'm not

879.839 --> 885.2790000000001
talking about

881.76 --> 888.16
the ideal gas equation fundy

885.279 --> 890.32
anti-flat earth fundy now i'm talking

888.16 --> 893.12
about calculating

890.32 --> 893.12
gas pressure

895.12 --> 899.839
huh

896.72 --> 899.839
just gas pressure

903.68 --> 906.88
yeah snowbirds

905.199 --> 908.079
you're getting it

906.88 --> 909.76
v

908.079 --> 910.959
so

909.76 --> 915.199
when you

910.959 --> 917.8389999999999
basically put words to the symbols of

915.199 --> 920.88
the calculation of gas pressure what

917.839 --> 923.0400000000001
does it stand for

920.88 --> 926.519
do you know do you know what v stands

923.04 --> 926.519
for in the formula

930.24 --> 934.8
i know you're going to answer it wrong

931.839 --> 937.839
because you are a zealot and i know how

934.8 --> 940.3199999999999
zealots answer this

937.839 --> 943.12
and i also know how you should answer

940.32 --> 945.839
yet you will not i would

943.12 --> 948.0
right now put a thousand euros on it as

945.839 --> 950.8000000000001
a bet because i know

948.0 --> 952.8
you're gonna do it wrong i know you will

950.8 --> 955.4399999999999
you have no choice

952.8 --> 959.68
you probably don't even see the choice

955.44 --> 959.6800000000001
psychologically because of white noise

961.759 --> 967.16
yeah thanks moonshadow thanks for

963.6 --> 967.16
ruining it

968.72 --> 970.9590000000001
yeah

971.6 --> 977.9200000000001
it's not just force a per area it's

974.8 --> 978.8
force per surface area

977.92 --> 980.8
right

978.8 --> 983.3599999999999
what is the pressure on

980.8 --> 985.199
on the volume

983.36 --> 986.8000000000001
it's within the volume

985.199 --> 989.8389999999999
on the surface

986.8 --> 989.8389999999999
of the container

991.839 --> 996.24
on the surface of the container

994.639 --> 999.519
you can actually google that it will

996.24 --> 1001.759
just directly say it

999.519 --> 1003.839
right

1001.759 --> 1006.88
unless you're like going to introduce

1003.839 --> 1008.9590000000001
words like atmosphere and then you'll

1006.88 --> 1010.639
see like suddenly you'll see a globe and

1008.959 --> 1012.3199999999999
you'll see all kinds of nonsense

1010.639 --> 1015.519
assertions

1012.32 --> 1019.36
machination misinformation provably

1015.519 --> 1022.24
false provably fallacious

1019.36 --> 1024.559
it will reveal that but if you just take

1022.24 --> 1028.72
the regular formula

1024.559 --> 1029.439
for gas pressure and how to calculate it

1028.72 --> 1031.839
it

1029.439 --> 1033.28
actually calculates

1031.839 --> 1037.72
pressure

1033.28 --> 1037.72
on the walls of the container

1038.079 --> 1042.1599999999999
the formula that's what it says that's

1039.679 --> 1045.2800000000002
what the v stands for right it doesn't

1042.16 --> 1048.48
just press on space now it presses on

1045.28 --> 1050.24
the walls that contain the space and

1048.48 --> 1053.2
that's how you calculate the gas

1050.24 --> 1056.96
pressure

1053.2 --> 1059.76
word salad you know it's called physics

1056.96 --> 1062.24
it's called official

1059.76 --> 1062.24
physics

1062.32 --> 1068.32
now it's very tough for you it's very

1064.4 --> 1068.3200000000002
very tough very strenuous

1072.72 --> 1081.16
proof doesn't exist inside so wow look

1076.16 --> 1081.16
at them squirt it's getting so bad

1086.559 --> 1089.6
another method

1089.84 --> 1094.1599999999999
i'd have to get

1091.28 --> 1096.08
the guys in on it math is actually not

1094.16 --> 1096.96
my strongest suit

1096.08 --> 1097.97
right

1096.96 --> 1099.2
but i do know

1097.97 --> 1100.88
[Music]

1099.2 --> 1104.0
what it is i

1100.88 --> 1106.4
heard the guy i know the guys that know

1104.0 --> 1108.32
they explained it to me i don't remember

1106.4 --> 1110.88
all the details because i don't really

1108.32 --> 1114.0
like math all that much but i do know

1110.88 --> 1117.2800000000002
how gas pressure is calculated

1114.0 --> 1120.48
i don't really remember the

1117.28 --> 1122.96
the literal formula but i can verbally

1120.48 --> 1125.1200000000001
describe it which is what the formulas

1122.96 --> 1127.039
usually stand for but if you just write

1125.12 --> 1130.1599999999999
down a bunch of letters

1127.039 --> 1131.919
it's a likelihood i'll misinterpret what

1130.16 --> 1134.48
it's supposed to mean

1131.919 --> 1137.5200000000002
but if you ask me to just describe it

1134.48 --> 1140.16
verbally then i will do it correctly

1137.52 --> 1142.08
because i know my material i know

1140.16 --> 1144.0
physics

1142.08 --> 1146.6399999999999
ah hey nathan oakley

1144.0 --> 1146.64
good to see you

1147.039 --> 1152.4
look at what

1148.559 --> 1152.3999999999999
what rolled into my hangout

1161.919 --> 1165.5200000000002
didn't claim gas pressure without a

1164.16 --> 1167.76
container

1165.52 --> 1172.24
to pressure ground level oh oh so

1167.76 --> 1174.799
another question another question

1172.24 --> 1176.48
yeah why isn't the pressure at ground

1174.799 --> 1177.84
level rushing

1176.48 --> 1180.559
because

1177.84 --> 1182.6399999999999
it's gradated due to temperature

1180.559 --> 1185.44
influences

1182.64 --> 1188.5590000000002
yeah you can have a closed container

1185.44 --> 1190.0
with gas in it if you introduce

1188.559 --> 1193.6789999999999
temperatures

1190.0 --> 1196.4
hot heat on one side cold on the other

1193.679 --> 1199.1200000000001
just like is provably

1196.4 --> 1200.64
present here on earth right the heat is

1199.12 --> 1201.76
introduced at ground level you can

1200.64 --> 1204.4
literally

1201.76 --> 1206.8799999999999
compare the temperatures you can size

1204.4 --> 1209.919
them up with a thermometer

1206.88 --> 1213.44
we reveal there is heat introduced at

1209.919 --> 1214.5590000000002
ground level so there is a clear lead of

1213.44 --> 1217.679
evidence

1214.559 --> 1220.6399999999999
for the formation of a gradation

1217.679 --> 1223.1200000000001
a gradient a gas pressure gradient

1220.64 --> 1225.2800000000002
within the available volume of the

1223.12 --> 1227.76
container

1225.28 --> 1230.3999999999999
understand so that's the reason there is

1227.76 --> 1232.08
a gradient but it's only there because

1230.4 --> 1234.799
it is contained

1232.08 --> 1236.0
because if there was no container

1234.799 --> 1238.0
it would

1236.0 --> 1240.0
evaporate it would

1238.0 --> 1242.48
get out all of it

1240.0 --> 1244.88
all the liquids would evaporate all the

1242.48 --> 1247.2
gases would get out of here because they

1244.88 --> 1248.5590000000002
would try to fill the available volume

1247.2 --> 1250.4
of the container

1248.559 --> 1252.72
which the heliocentric model

1250.4 --> 1256.72
specifically suggests

1252.72 --> 1256.72
is an outer space vacuum of

1256.799 --> 1258.96
infinite

1257.84 --> 1261.76
volume

1258.96 --> 1264.159
or very close to

1261.76 --> 1264.96
any larger number than any human being

1264.159 --> 1266.5590000000002
can

1264.96 --> 1269.1200000000001
imagine

1266.559 --> 1271.6789999999999
right so it likes to spread out and then

1269.12 --> 1273.52
hey if the gas eventually fills that

1271.679 --> 1275.919
container which the outer space vacuum

1273.52 --> 1279.36
could never be filled by the

1275.919 --> 1282.0
mere amount of gas present here on earth

1279.36 --> 1283.36
then it might gradiate out

1282.0 --> 1286.559
but

1283.36 --> 1289.1999999999998
since there is much thicker gas pressure

1286.559 --> 1291.2
here on earth that means that the volume

1289.2 --> 1293.28
of the available

1291.2 --> 1295.8400000000001
the available volume of the container

1293.28 --> 1298.6399999999999
must be a lot smaller

1295.84 --> 1301.36
than infinite

1298.64 --> 1304.4
right because otherwise the gradient

1301.36 --> 1305.52
wouldn't be able to form

1304.4 --> 1308.799
in this

1305.52 --> 1310.6399999999999
measurable fashion

1308.799 --> 1313.6
in an infinite volume container

1310.64 --> 1316.3200000000002
gradation would be so

1313.6 --> 1318.6399999999999
so slight because of the

1316.32 --> 1321.2
astronomical distances

1318.64 --> 1325.679
that here on earth we would never even

1321.2 --> 1325.679
be able to measure any form of gradient

1325.84 --> 1330.3999999999999
we wouldn't have any gas really but if

1327.919 --> 1332.5590000000002
the entire universe was filled with gas

1330.4 --> 1335.44
then the gradation

1332.559 --> 1338.6399999999999
would be so minute

1335.44 --> 1341.039
over the distance that we can measure

1338.64 --> 1344.0
here on earth we wouldn't even notice a

1341.039 --> 1346.72
gradient yet we do notice a gradient

1344.0 --> 1348.08
which can only mean one thing the

1346.72 --> 1349.039
container

1348.08 --> 1352.72
is

1349.039 --> 1352.72
much and much smaller

1353.52 --> 1360.28
much smaller than infinite

1357.039 --> 1360.28
you understand

1366.159 --> 1371.2800000000002
so stop pestering ben white i just

1368.88 --> 1375.8400000000001
addressed the entire reason for a

1371.28 --> 1375.84
gradient being here in this realm

1376.0 --> 1381.679
can only be because of one thing because

1378.64 --> 1384.7990000000002
there is a relatively limited sized

1381.679 --> 1385.919
container in order for us to be able to

1384.799 --> 1390.08
measure

1385.919 --> 1391.039
the gradient within our reach

1390.08 --> 1394.6399999999999
if the

1391.039 --> 1396.799
container volume was much much bigger

1394.64 --> 1399.679
even a thousand times bigger we would

1396.799 --> 1401.52
probably not be able to measure

1399.679 --> 1403.52
the gradient

1401.52 --> 1405.76
because the gradation would be so spread

1403.52 --> 1408.1589999999999
out we wouldn't even recognize it as a

1405.76 --> 1410.64
gradient you see

1408.159 --> 1412.24
but you don't understand anything about

1410.64 --> 1415.039
all of that

1412.24 --> 1417.52
you like to think based on very

1415.039 --> 1419.76
blatantly false assumptions

1417.52 --> 1422.0
that gravity

1419.76 --> 1424.0
the acceleration

1422.0 --> 1426.32
yeah the steady acceleration you think

1424.0 --> 1428.48
is gravity that it is

1426.32 --> 1431.2
somehow keeping the gas

1428.48 --> 1432.72
pressure to the ball versus all that

1431.2 --> 1434.64
outer space

1432.72 --> 1437.44
unfortunately though

1434.64 --> 1441.679
that is physically impossible it's based

1437.44 --> 1443.3600000000001
on the misconception that gas has mass

1441.679 --> 1444.4
and it doesn't

1443.36 --> 1446.1589999999999
you see

1444.4 --> 1448.5590000000002
atomic mass

1446.159 --> 1451.5200000000002
which is what is registered with like

1448.559 --> 1453.6
every material

1451.52 --> 1457.44
every atom

1453.6 --> 1460.08
atomic mass it's not actually mass

1457.44 --> 1462.4
it's a derived concept

1460.08 --> 1464.48
based on the idea of a single isolating

1462.4 --> 1468.159
a singular molecule

1464.48 --> 1473.84
and then extracting the density

1468.159 --> 1476.4
right mass is derived from density

1473.84 --> 1478.799
but the thing is though gases don't

1476.4 --> 1481.44
really have mass they have a density but

1478.799 --> 1485.76
they don't have mass because mass

1481.44 --> 1486.72
indicates a very specific ability

1485.76 --> 1488.0
to

1486.72 --> 1491.3600000000001
well

1488.0 --> 1491.36
to gain momentum

1491.919 --> 1497.279
what's the other word again uh

1494.4 --> 1497.279
brian says it

1497.919 --> 1502.72
i i call it susceptibility to momentum

1500.559 --> 1505.52
there's other words for it that are more

1502.72 --> 1507.84
in-depth mechanical natured

1505.52 --> 1508.8799999999999
but it really does come down to that gas

1507.84 --> 1512.3999999999999
doesn't

1508.88 --> 1516.159
have momentum if you throw gas

1512.4 --> 1518.88
it stops it doesn't continue on like

1516.159 --> 1522.0800000000002
liquids and solids do what it does is

1518.88 --> 1525.2
immediately try to find an equilibrium

1522.08 --> 1527.36
with the surrounding gases

1525.2 --> 1530.159
it will only respond to local air

1527.36 --> 1532.9599999999998
pressure differential cannot be pulled

1530.159 --> 1532.96
it cannot be

1535.679 --> 1540.4
swinging

1537.44 --> 1542.96
it won't carry on once it

1540.4 --> 1545.3600000000001
yeah gains a push in a direction it'll

1542.96 --> 1548.4
only try to equilibrate with the

1545.36 --> 1550.3999999999999
pressure surrounding it that's it

1548.4 --> 1552.799
it doesn't carry on it doesn't have

1550.4 --> 1556.48
momentum

1552.799 --> 1559.6
and that means that it even theoretical

1556.48 --> 1563.279
assumed gravity couldn't influence it

1559.6 --> 1563.279
right that's why newton

1563.44 --> 1569.679
is like his formula his conceptions

1566.64 --> 1572.5590000000002
from which gravity and mass

1569.679 --> 1576.3200000000002
per physics tradition are based

1572.559 --> 1578.24
it's incomplete because he never

1576.32 --> 1580.0
really accounted

1578.24 --> 1582.08
for gas

1580.0 --> 1584.48
not having mass

1582.08 --> 1587.6789999999999
he never accounted for that he kind of

1584.48 --> 1590.32
left it out out of the out of the system

1587.679 --> 1593.3600000000001
he was basically only concerned with

1590.32 --> 1594.559
things that were susceptible to momentum

1593.36 --> 1596.7199999999998
and gas

1594.559 --> 1598.6399999999999
fell out of that category the only

1596.72 --> 1601.6000000000001
reason he would account

1598.64 --> 1604.4
for gases in his formulas

1601.6 --> 1607.6789999999999
was to determine air friction which

1604.4 --> 1610.3200000000002
would palpably measurably slow objects

1607.679 --> 1613.76
down in trajectories right

1610.32 --> 1616.48
that's the only thing the only ability

1613.76 --> 1618.799
that even hints at the existence of gas

1616.48 --> 1620.32
because other than that in his entire

1618.799 --> 1622.24
set of formula

1620.32 --> 1625.6789999999999
formulae

1622.24 --> 1627.84
gas was completely ignored

1625.679 --> 1627.8400000000001
right

1628.08 --> 1632.799
and that's also

1629.76 --> 1634.8799999999999
very logically the reason why he

1632.799 --> 1636.48
officially

1634.88 --> 1637.8400000000001
disclaimed

1636.48 --> 1641.1200000000001
gravitation

1637.84 --> 1643.12
as a viable hypothesis because he knew

1641.12 --> 1646.9599999999998
that his modeling was based on

1643.12 --> 1648.6399999999999
incomplete incomplete works

1646.96 --> 1651.039
he knew that

1648.64 --> 1652.96
he knew it was ridiculous only somebody

1651.039 --> 1655.36
that is ill-informed

1652.96 --> 1657.6000000000001
could believe it could mechanically work

1655.36 --> 1657.6
out

1665.36 --> 1668.6789999999999
oh [ __ ]

1677.039 --> 1680.6
hold on guys

1713.6 --> 1716.0
all right

1716.08 --> 1721.1589999999999
so let's see what's going on here

1734.64 --> 1739.44
oh um yeah but um

1737.679 --> 1740.96
you see

1739.44 --> 1743.52
everything that's rolling out now

1740.96 --> 1745.039
because of the quality

1743.52 --> 1746.32
the

1745.039 --> 1748.799
proven

1746.32 --> 1750.08
registered information that i just

1748.799 --> 1752.32
presented

1750.08 --> 1753.84
they have no other recourse than to

1752.32 --> 1756.08
basically

1753.84 --> 1759.36
subconsciously recognize their own

1756.08 --> 1762.24
failings and immediately project it onto

1759.36 --> 1763.36
us in order to avoid realizing their

1762.24 --> 1766.3990000000001
failure

1763.36 --> 1768.6399999999999
you see so this is pure projection see

1766.399 --> 1771.52
like saying

1768.64 --> 1773.039
arguing with objective reality is a

1771.52 --> 1775.12
mental illness

1773.039 --> 1777.52
i recommend getting yourselves checked

1775.12 --> 1781.52
out yeah yeah yeah

1777.52 --> 1784.6
well i'm getting you checked out and

1781.52 --> 1788.48
my analysis is you are

1784.6 --> 1790.799
blatantly obviously probably not so

1788.48 --> 1794.24
obvious to you or maybe you're just

1790.799 --> 1797.279
trying to hope it'll actually rub off

1794.24 --> 1798.72
you're the one projecting now

1797.279 --> 1802.399
because i just

1798.72 --> 1805.679
described to you objective reality

1802.399 --> 1806.9599999999998
registered official things

1805.679 --> 1810.159
and you

1806.96 --> 1813.76
are not addressing them instead you're

1810.159 --> 1815.8400000000001
projecting your predicament onto me

1813.76 --> 1818.48
because you're the one arguing with

1815.84 --> 1820.24
objective reality right i'm just

1818.48 --> 1825.039
presenting

1820.24 --> 1825.039
official registered historical facts

1825.36 --> 1830.24
i know it's very painful

1828.159 --> 1832.48
but that's the truth

1830.24 --> 1834.72
and people can figure this out for

1832.48 --> 1837.3600000000001
themselves doing their own research

1834.72 --> 1839.76
right people that care to know

1837.36 --> 1844.0
not people that would settle

1839.76 --> 1845.2
for listening to some squirter troll

1844.0 --> 1847.36
that's

1845.2 --> 1851.279
just getting really ridiculous not

1847.36 --> 1854.24
rebutting any questions or statements

1851.279 --> 1856.32
but just projecting their mental illness

1854.24 --> 1858.72
like nobody's gonna buy that

1856.32 --> 1861.76
at best they're gonna be deterred

1858.72 --> 1862.64
because they don't want to be confronted

1861.76 --> 1864.919
with

1862.64 --> 1866.5590000000002
disgusting

1864.919 --> 1870.3990000000001
disgusting

1866.559 --> 1872.72
individuals like yourselves right

1870.399 --> 1874.559
and to be fair that's a pretty good

1872.72 --> 1876.0
reason not to get involved because who

1874.559 --> 1876.84
would want to

1876.0 --> 1881.039
get

1876.84 --> 1882.72
involved with like disgusting cultist

1881.039 --> 1886.48
pieces of [ __ ]

1882.72 --> 1890.159
that are constantly lying and projecting

1886.48 --> 1893.1200000000001
and spamming and triggering

1890.159 --> 1895.919
the most nonsensical garbage

1893.12 --> 1899.6789999999999
one could ever imagine right like even

1895.919 --> 1902.64
when you get into left-right political

1899.679 --> 1906.24
squabbles you don't get confronted with

1902.64 --> 1907.76
nasty sickening levels of mental illness

1906.24 --> 1911.519
and retardation

1907.76 --> 1913.6
like you do when you get into flat earth

1911.519 --> 1915.44
that's what you have to deal with with

1913.6 --> 1916.6789999999999
psychos

1915.44 --> 1920.559
sick

1916.679 --> 1923.76
disgusting individuals like yourself

1920.559 --> 1923.76
flat earth is a cult

1923.919 --> 1930.3200000000002
yeah m

1926.96 --> 1932.64
who wants to deal with disgusting

1930.32 --> 1938.08
monsters like you

1932.64 --> 1938.0800000000002
nobody right i don't mind though

1938.64 --> 1942.3200000000002
i don't mind too much because my entire

1941.2 --> 1944.0
life

1942.32 --> 1947.799
was always

1944.0 --> 1951.12
about me not wanting to deal with how

1947.799 --> 1952.8799999999999
unbelievably disgusting

1951.12 --> 1956.4799999999998
some people can get

1952.88 --> 1958.64
how monstrously demonic certain

1956.48 --> 1962.48
individuals get

1958.64 --> 1965.8400000000001
lying so badly so badly

1962.48 --> 1967.6
when put on the spot even in secret they

1965.84 --> 1970.48
can't even

1967.6 --> 1972.9599999999998
realize they're lying anymore they're so

1970.48 --> 1976.3990000000001
unbelievably insane

1972.96 --> 1978.48
they can't even be confronted inside of

1976.399 --> 1982.1589999999999
themselves anymore with when they're

1978.48 --> 1983.44
lying and not they're that unbelievably

1982.159 --> 1985.44
delusional

1983.44 --> 1987.679
who wants to deal with those people i

1985.44 --> 1990.3990000000001
don't want to deal with those people but

1987.679 --> 1992.159
because they've haunted me everywhere in

1990.399 --> 1994.399
every field

1992.159 --> 1996.0
and i refuse to [ __ ]

1994.399 --> 1999.1999999999998
two lies

1996.0 --> 2001.76
under any circumstances no matter the

1999.2 --> 2005.44
cost even if it kills me

2001.76 --> 2009.519
i was always destined to be

2005.44 --> 2010.96
dealing with disgusting monsters

2009.519 --> 2014.32
like this

2010.96 --> 2016.32
and that's why i just decided

2014.32 --> 2020.0
suit up

2016.32 --> 2023.76
get your armor ready get your sword and

2020.0 --> 2026.159
prepare to battle the rest of your life

2023.76 --> 2028.24
through psychology

2026.159 --> 2031.3600000000001
and confidence

2028.24 --> 2034.3990000000001
and knowledge and insight

2031.36 --> 2035.36
is will be the greatest weapon

2034.399 --> 2038.8799999999999
but

2035.36 --> 2041.6
the amount of demonic blood spewing in

2038.88 --> 2042.96
all directions as i hack the demons

2041.6 --> 2044.799
apart

2042.96 --> 2047.76
that would just come more and more and

2044.799 --> 2050.079
more yeah i'm gonna be covered in demon

2047.76 --> 2052.32
blood and it's gonna stink

2050.079 --> 2055.3590000000004
and it's gonna be nauseating

2052.32 --> 2058.04
i have no other choice i have to hack

2055.359 --> 2061.119
them all apart psychologically

2058.04 --> 2063.52
metaphorically and keep on slashing and

2061.119 --> 2066.2400000000002
slashing and slashing

2063.52 --> 2069.919
so that everybody can witness as these

2066.24 --> 2073.359
demonic lying scumbags

2069.919 --> 2077.72
get metaphorically hacked to pieces

2073.359 --> 2077.72
every single time unrelentingly

2086.8 --> 2092.3990000000003
keep squirting for me boy

2089.2 --> 2092.399
there's nothing you can do

2095.28 --> 2100.6400000000003
there's no manner of denial

2097.76 --> 2104.079
that you can successfully project onto

2100.64 --> 2107.839
the world that would prevent everybody

2104.079 --> 2108.88
from completely figuring out what you

2107.839 --> 2111.68
are

2108.88 --> 2115.119
how you work what you do

2111.68 --> 2118.8799999999997
and predict every single move

2115.119 --> 2122.0
every single move even the secret hidden

2118.88 --> 2126.0
sensations that you live through

2122.0 --> 2130.16
when not engaging in the chat becomes

2126.0 --> 2132.48
visible and predictable to me yeah i can

2130.16 --> 2135.2
see inside of you

2132.48 --> 2137.76
because i know exactly what is happening

2135.2 --> 2140.96
to you what that is like

2137.76 --> 2144.48
how sickening it is and how weak it

2140.96 --> 2147.839
makes your mind so weak that you

2144.48 --> 2150.4
literally cannot even see your own lies

2147.839 --> 2150.4
anymore

2150.56 --> 2154.7999999999997
i know what it is

2152.4 --> 2157.52
i know how it works i can point it out

2154.8 --> 2160.2400000000002
as it happens every single time

2157.52 --> 2162.16
i can see the projecting

2160.24 --> 2164.7999999999997
right and i don't even have to say

2162.16 --> 2167.04
projecting anymore at some point people

2164.8 --> 2170.8
will literally see

2167.04 --> 2173.2
how 180 degrees projected all this

2170.8 --> 2174.079
garbage rolling out of them is

2173.2 --> 2176.16
right

2174.079 --> 2178.4
talking of psychosis

2176.16 --> 2180.56
huh

2178.4 --> 2182.64
like who's talking about an invisible

2180.56 --> 2184.64
wizard here

2182.64 --> 2187.7599999999998
literally thinking we're demons no you

2184.64 --> 2191.5989999999997
are a demon yeah not saying you're a

2187.76 --> 2194.1600000000003
physical weirdo humanoid creature no

2191.599 --> 2196.56
it's a spirit it's a spirit of

2194.16 --> 2199.5989999999997
unrelenting denial

2196.56 --> 2201.599
lies and death

2199.599 --> 2204.2400000000002
spiritual death

2201.599 --> 2207.119
it's what happens when you completely

2204.24 --> 2210.7999999999997
surrender two lies to such a degree that

2207.119 --> 2212.1600000000003
you can't even detect anymore when

2210.8 --> 2215.8390000000004
you're lying

2212.16 --> 2215.839
that's called a demon

2216.24 --> 2221.9199999999996
why don't you look into some history

2220.48 --> 2224.32
about

2221.92 --> 2226.8
about that sort of thing in religion

2224.32 --> 2229.599
you'll find out they actually had a

2226.8 --> 2231.32
pretty decent analysis right it's not

2229.599 --> 2234.7200000000003
based on modern

2231.32 --> 2236.7200000000003
psychiatry based atheist

2234.72 --> 2239.9199999999996
psychology and all that

2236.72 --> 2243.52
but the mechanisms were definitely

2239.92 --> 2244.96
detected described and attempted to deal

2243.52 --> 2246.56
with them

2244.96 --> 2248.7200000000003
so yes

2246.56 --> 2251.44
you are a demon

2248.72 --> 2253.839
flat earth is occult you are

2251.44 --> 2257.119
historically you are people can

2253.839 --> 2259.2799999999997
literally pick up books religious books

2257.119 --> 2261.52
and cross-reference your actions that

2259.28 --> 2264.079
you're doing right now

2261.52 --> 2267.28
with what is described in those books

2264.079 --> 2269.76
and they will recognize no matter what

2267.28 --> 2272.2400000000002
you do no matter how much you project no

2269.76 --> 2274.8
matter what no matter how much garbage

2272.24 --> 2279.2799999999997
you barf out over the chat

2274.8 --> 2281.92
they will see exactly what you are

2279.28 --> 2284.48
flat earth is a cult

2281.92 --> 2287.6800000000003
do you realize that can you feel it can

2284.48 --> 2287.68
you feel the burn

2295.04 --> 2299.4
i needed that thank you

2300.12 --> 2303.85
[Music]

2319.2 --> 2323.68
now you can feel the burn

2321.599 --> 2326.079
you're you're just like a typical

2323.68 --> 2328.48
psychotic politician right now because

2326.079 --> 2330.8
you don't have to have power

2328.48 --> 2333.04
to become that demonic

2330.8 --> 2335.599
you can just be tricked

2333.04 --> 2337.599
into becoming that demonic because you

2335.599 --> 2339.76
think nothing matters anymore and there

2337.599 --> 2342.96
is no god and you can just lie as much

2339.76 --> 2344.079
as you want and it's even profitable

2342.96 --> 2346.96
yeah

2344.079 --> 2349.28
yeah lying is so easy

2346.96 --> 2352.48
but the price though

2349.28 --> 2355.3590000000004
you know the price

2352.48 --> 2358.96
you know i don't think lying is worth my

2355.359 --> 2361.44
mind the quality of my mind

2358.96 --> 2364.32
being able to distinguish what is what

2361.44 --> 2365.119
you know since i learned to never ever

2364.32 --> 2366.1600000000003
lie

2365.119 --> 2367.2000000000003
ever

2366.16 --> 2369.5989999999997
ever

2367.2 --> 2372.3999999999996
and even when i

2369.599 --> 2375.3590000000004
conjure dreams i have to be extremely

2372.4 --> 2377.599
careful to share the fact that i am

2375.359 --> 2380.0789999999997
conjuring a dream and it's not actually

2377.599 --> 2382.48
a claim of reality and as soon as i

2380.079 --> 2385.44
started to really uphold that more than

2382.48 --> 2388.4
ever because i always i never liked

2385.44 --> 2391.359
lying i always found it repulsive but as

2388.4 --> 2394.64
soon as i really decided

2391.359 --> 2398.4
religiously decided to speak the truth

2394.64 --> 2400.0
as i figured it out always no matter the

2398.4 --> 2403.52
cost

2400.0 --> 2406.96
i've actually attained more grip

2403.52 --> 2410.8
on reality and figured out how people

2406.96 --> 2413.599
really work and how to distinguish

2410.8 --> 2416.6400000000003
from their words

2413.599 --> 2420.319
where they are at spiritually where

2416.64 --> 2425.04
what the sensation of them must be like

2420.319 --> 2428.079
whether they're numbed triggered burning

2425.04 --> 2430.96
because the direct response in how they

2428.079 --> 2433.3590000000004
react is a fully automated process but

2430.96 --> 2435.52
it reveals exactly

2433.359 --> 2438.319
the frequency of where they're at every

2435.52 --> 2441.04
single time it's inescapable every word

2438.319 --> 2442.56
that comes out of you reveals you now to

2441.04 --> 2444.24
me why

2442.56 --> 2446.16
because i chose

2444.24 --> 2449.2799999999997
never to lie

2446.16 --> 2452.56
to always let the truth shine on me

2449.28 --> 2453.599
whether it hurt or was a blessing and

2452.56 --> 2456.88
that way

2453.599 --> 2459.839
you just clear up you start to see what

2456.88 --> 2462.8
is the truth because you choose to learn

2459.839 --> 2464.56
to handle it to wield it and then when

2462.8 --> 2467.6800000000003
you wield it

2464.56 --> 2471.68
you lose the white noise

2467.68 --> 2474.16
you see when you can't handle the truth

2471.68 --> 2476.319
you get white noise you escape it you

2474.16 --> 2479.44
avoid it you don't see it anymore and

2476.319 --> 2482.64
with that you lose the grip over the

2479.44 --> 2484.56
entire subject that you cannot handle

2482.64 --> 2488.7999999999997
you start to create parallel

2484.56 --> 2488.7999999999997
constructions to serve cervant

2489.76 --> 2494.079
to

2491.44 --> 2497.04
move around it

2494.079 --> 2499.3590000000004
psychologically right but if you just

2497.04 --> 2501.2
confront everything

2499.359 --> 2503.04
even the things that you can't handle

2501.2 --> 2505.2799999999997
really or you think you can't handle

2503.04 --> 2506.96
then you lose the white noise and you

2505.28 --> 2509.3590000000004
gain grip

2506.96 --> 2511.2
over what you've before that time

2509.359 --> 2514.4
couldn't handle

2511.2 --> 2516.7999999999997
and you clear up you see more you see

2514.4 --> 2518.7200000000003
more about

2516.8 --> 2522.2400000000002
what is in people

2518.72 --> 2526.48
what they are who they are how they live

2522.24 --> 2530.64
what energy they carry what they can do

2526.48 --> 2532.72
what is in their future you start to see

2530.64 --> 2534.319
and it's glorious

2532.72 --> 2536.7999999999997
it's great

2534.319 --> 2540.24
it's great to be able to do that

2536.8 --> 2544.8
it was worth the price it was worth the

2540.24 --> 2548.5989999999997
price of never lying again

2544.8 --> 2548.599
it was worth it

2550.079 --> 2555.2000000000003
hey betty corners

2552.16 --> 2555.2
connors thank you

2560.72 --> 2564.9599999999996
okay

2562.8 --> 2567.52
you've been sharing my show even though

2564.96 --> 2570.2400000000002
you don't agree with everything okay

2567.52 --> 2572.48
well that's great you know

2570.24 --> 2574.3999999999996
i would be surprised

2572.48 --> 2576.56
if anybody would

2574.4 --> 2579.44
bump into my show

2576.56 --> 2580.96
and immediately agreed with everything i

2579.44 --> 2582.319
had to say

2580.96 --> 2585.28
because

2582.319 --> 2585.2799999999997
i avoid

2585.76 --> 2592.4
feeding people what they want

2589.28 --> 2594.7200000000003
instead i focus on feeding people

2592.4 --> 2597.599
what i think they need

2594.72 --> 2600.24
i present them with psychological

2597.599 --> 2602.48
emotional challenges

2600.24 --> 2605.1189999999997
that they can be confronted with and

2602.48 --> 2606.72
then choose to be brave and deal with

2605.119 --> 2608.079
those

2606.72 --> 2609.9199999999996
obstacles

2608.079 --> 2612.4
so they can

2609.92 --> 2614.319
get a more refined insight on where

2612.4 --> 2617.44
they're really at

2614.319 --> 2619.599
and maybe grow and overcome them i i

2617.44 --> 2621.92
like to present challenges

2619.599 --> 2624.0
so it's very rare that anybody would

2621.92 --> 2626.4
bump into my channel for the first time

2624.0 --> 2628.0
and like outright agree with everything

2626.4 --> 2630.319
i had to say that

2628.0 --> 2631.68
maybe in the future right

2630.319 --> 2635.8
but

2631.68 --> 2635.7999999999997
years ago dude

2636.0 --> 2641.2
two two three years ago

2638.319 --> 2643.68
most people that even came by

2641.2 --> 2645.5989999999997
my shows half of them

2643.68 --> 2647.2799999999997
didn't even understand what the hell i

2645.599 --> 2649.119
was talking about every time like they

2647.28 --> 2652.0
just couldn't follow it

2649.119 --> 2654.48
but they just kind of went for my

2652.0 --> 2657.2
character for my psychology and all that

2654.48 --> 2659.2
and maybe some spiritual talk

2657.2 --> 2661.839
right but they didn't really understand

2659.2 --> 2664.7999999999997
it now there's a lot more people that

2661.839 --> 2667.2
actually understand what i've been

2664.8 --> 2668.6400000000003
trying to communicate for years and

2667.2 --> 2670.48
years

2668.64 --> 2674.0
because it takes time

2670.48 --> 2676.48
it takes time to actually

2674.0 --> 2680.16
get there

2676.48 --> 2683.28
and i am here to offer you that climb

2680.16 --> 2685.7599999999998
i'm showing you you can climb there you

2683.28 --> 2688.48
can go there you can attain this you can

2685.76 --> 2691.5200000000004
gain this power for yourself

2688.48 --> 2693.839
use it wisely

2691.52 --> 2693.839
because

2694.079 --> 2698.5600000000004
one flick

2695.76 --> 2699.96
one flick of the fingers

2698.56 --> 2703.119
one

2699.96 --> 2705.92
mismotivation one lie

2703.119 --> 2708.48
and it all drops into the [ __ ] hole it's

2705.92 --> 2708.48
all gone

2709.839 --> 2715.96
anyway

2712.16 --> 2715.96
oh he's still squirting

2727.2 --> 2732.7999999999997
yeah i know flat sabbath

2730.64 --> 2736.24
it is sad

2732.8 --> 2738.6400000000003
and it was very ad homie so i had to

2736.24 --> 2739.7599999999998
well not at home because i don't really

2738.64 --> 2741.92
add hum

2739.76 --> 2743.44
i psychoanalyze

2741.92 --> 2745.28
you see

2743.44 --> 2746.56
it might hurt

2745.28 --> 2748.2400000000002
to be

2746.56 --> 2750.88
confronted with something you're

2748.24 --> 2752.319
desperately trying to hide from for for

2750.88 --> 2753.92
yourself

2752.319 --> 2756.72
but

2753.92 --> 2759.359
unlike regular at homes

2756.72 --> 2761.7599999999998
a psychoanalysis actually presents a

2759.359 --> 2764.56
really an honest picture

2761.76 --> 2767.44
that is there for your benefit because

2764.56 --> 2769.359
it allows you to potentially overcome

2767.44 --> 2770.2400000000002
that obstacle

2769.359 --> 2772.4
you see

2770.24 --> 2775.1189999999997
i'm trying to help you

2772.4 --> 2777.04
mr projector man who thinks i'm the one

2775.119 --> 2778.96
that's psychotic

2777.04 --> 2781.2
and i'm wrong about everything even

2778.96 --> 2783.76
though you can't even answer basic

2781.2 --> 2783.7599999999998
questions

2784.88 --> 2787.96
you know

2793.52 --> 2797.68
oh no no no now you're putting words in

2795.68 --> 2799.7599999999998
my mouth now you're just lying flatter

2797.68 --> 2803.68
testicle i never said you had demonic

2799.76 --> 2806.3190000000004
blood i specifically

2803.68 --> 2807.2
denounced that notion it has nothing to

2806.319 --> 2809.52
do

2807.2 --> 2811.2
with genetics

2809.52 --> 2814.0
it's nothing to do

2811.2 --> 2817.5989999999997
with your humanoid form it has to do

2814.0 --> 2821.04
with the spirit the spirit your

2817.599 --> 2822.6400000000003
consciousness the impulses the feelings

2821.04 --> 2825.2
you have

2822.64 --> 2828.319
there are certain patterns

2825.2 --> 2831.359
that are built within the human psyche

2828.319 --> 2834.64
modes you can attain and one of them one

2831.359 --> 2838.64
of the worst ones is the demon

2834.64 --> 2840.319
and it is religiously described in a lot

2838.64 --> 2842.48
of different texts because a lot of

2840.319 --> 2845.2799999999997
people had to deal with this condition

2842.48 --> 2848.64
this state of being that arrives and

2845.28 --> 2850.96
does so much damage to everything

2848.64 --> 2853.2
to the individual or even worse to

2850.96 --> 2855.839
everybody around them right the real

2853.2 --> 2858.8799999999997
psychopaths

2855.839 --> 2862.72
right so yeah it's spiritual it's not

2858.88 --> 2864.7200000000003
demon blood you reifying scumbag

2862.72 --> 2867.839
straw manning me putting words in my

2864.72 --> 2869.7599999999998
mouth that i specifically denounced

2867.839 --> 2871.68
scumbag

2869.76 --> 2875.2000000000003
this is not about your stupid little

2871.68 --> 2876.72
fantasy computer games this is actual

2875.2 --> 2879.4399999999996
real things

2876.72 --> 2881.9199999999996
real spirit psychology based in

2879.44 --> 2884.16
historical reference which computer

2881.92 --> 2886.0
games like to emulate

2884.16 --> 2887.68
they like to play around with that

2886.0 --> 2889.68
fantasy

2887.68 --> 2891.52
this is very inspiring because it's

2889.68 --> 2893.839
based on real things it's just kind of

2891.52 --> 2895.2
pulled out of context during the games

2893.839 --> 2896.4
so you don't have to take it so

2895.2 --> 2898.5589999999997
seriously

2896.4 --> 2901.6800000000003
and then you could present a straw man

2898.559 --> 2903.28
argument about how arwyn said that you

2901.68 --> 2905.7599999999998
had demon blood

2903.28 --> 2908.2400000000002
right that's what that's there for

2905.76 --> 2910.88
to make it easier for you

2908.24 --> 2911.9199999999996
to weave a lies

2910.88 --> 2914.559
lies

2911.92 --> 2918.119
that are coming out of you blatantly

2914.559 --> 2918.119
probably so

2923.92 --> 2926.92
hmm

2935.359 --> 2938.359
ah

2945.76 --> 2951.3590000000004
you see beyond the presupposed curve

2950.0 --> 2953.119
oh yeah

2951.359 --> 2954.96
that's right

2953.119 --> 2956.8
black swan

2954.96 --> 2958.8
that's the title of the show

2956.8 --> 2960.0
spherical geometry has been optically

2958.8 --> 2962.559
defiled

2960.0 --> 2962.559
that's right

2962.96 --> 2970.0
you can see further than the

2965.92 --> 2972.4
spherical geometry of presumed size

2970.0 --> 2975.68
sphere earth allows

2972.4 --> 2979.599
geometry doesn't work like that

2975.68 --> 2981.7599999999998
you can't see behind a physical

2979.599 --> 2984.4
obstruction

2981.76 --> 2987.599
you can't see behind it that not without

2984.4 --> 2990.88
like blatant mirrors or whatever that

2987.599 --> 2993.88
are specifically placed and solid mind

2990.88 --> 2993.88
you

3016.559 --> 3021.0400000000004
oh look i was repeating the same sh are

3018.8 --> 3024.0
you are you getting back to the list

3021.04 --> 3026.48
starting over again flat earth is a call

3024.0 --> 3029.359
because if you're just gonna copy paste

3026.48 --> 3031.599
the the nonsense you entered this chat

3029.359 --> 3031.5989999999997
with

3031.839 --> 3036.24
it's gonna get boring

3034.4 --> 3041.319
i'm not gonna do the whole thing over

3036.24 --> 3041.319
again once was blatantly enough

3043.599 --> 3048.3590000000004
yeah return to normal i'm afraid so

3054.48 --> 3058.72
that that's very noble of you will

3056.559 --> 3060.4
gaston i don't think he will though

3058.72 --> 3063.4399999999996
because

3060.4 --> 3065.359
you know i basically identified his him

3063.44 --> 3067.119
as a demon and that's something he

3065.359 --> 3069.5989999999997
doesn't

3067.119 --> 3072.96
want to recognize that it's actually

3069.599 --> 3072.96
possible so

3075.92 --> 3080.079
because he probably feels what that

3077.92 --> 3083.2000000000003
actually means you know when you call

3080.079 --> 3085.04
the name of something that's real

3083.2 --> 3087.359
when you call out something that's

3085.04 --> 3088.8
rooted in some real thing and not some

3087.359 --> 3090.319
fantasy right

3088.8 --> 3092.1600000000003
not some

3090.319 --> 3095.52
like logical

3092.16 --> 3096.7999999999997
proven fantasy like a video game world

3095.52 --> 3100.24
or whatever

3096.8 --> 3103.52
and if it's based in things that are

3100.24 --> 3106.319
rooted in the real world history

3103.52 --> 3108.96
and you call it my name

3106.319 --> 3108.96
that hurts

3109.2 --> 3115.04
there's actually a magic to that

3112.079 --> 3117.3590000000004
very fascinating magic

3115.04 --> 3118.4
naming

3117.359 --> 3121.359
it's

3118.4 --> 3125.839
it's pretty bizarre and i'm not going to

3121.359 --> 3125.839
like give out lectures on how that works

3130.16 --> 3133.92
but yeah you're gonna

3131.76 --> 3137.5200000000004
lie and dance around it because it's

3133.92 --> 3138.559
very triggering to be identified as the

3137.52 --> 3140.16
demon

3138.559 --> 3142.88
that you are

3140.16 --> 3144.8799999999997
right and now deep inside of you

3142.88 --> 3147.04
you are not that demon

3144.88 --> 3148.96
you probably used to be

3147.04 --> 3150.839
somebody that was

3148.96 --> 3153.44
kind of okay

3150.839 --> 3155.52
whatever and then you just

3153.44 --> 3158.0
got confronted with one thing after

3155.52 --> 3160.72
another that you couldn't handle and

3158.0 --> 3161.76
and then in desperation you wanted power

3160.72 --> 3163.7599999999998
out of it

3161.76 --> 3166.2400000000002
like if i'm gonna

3163.76 --> 3168.4
be in a torturous world that i cannot

3166.24 --> 3170.5589999999997
accept and i'm gonna seek out power and

3168.4 --> 3172.48
that's what you tried and you obviously

3170.559 --> 3174.1600000000003
failed because you're now in troll a

3172.48 --> 3176.319
troll in chat

3174.16 --> 3178.24
which is really

3176.319 --> 3181.2799999999997
one of the lowest

3178.24 --> 3184.24
forms of occupation a human being could

3181.28 --> 3184.2400000000002
have in this world

3184.72 --> 3189.5989999999997
and it's a demon that that's

3187.119 --> 3191.839
that's what caught you the demon caught

3189.599 --> 3192.96
you and you act

3191.839 --> 3195.2
as it

3192.96 --> 3198.0
you made it you

3195.2 --> 3200.16
it's you now you're the demon now you

3198.0 --> 3201.92
made the mistake you didn't recognize

3200.16 --> 3204.319
the mistake

3201.92 --> 3208.48
you didn't try to overcome it

3204.319 --> 3210.5589999999997
so you became the mistake

3208.48 --> 3212.2400000000002
you're the demon now

3210.559 --> 3215.3590000000004
because of what you did

3212.24 --> 3215.359
how the weakness

3216.4 --> 3219.28
you let

3217.599 --> 3221.28
the weakness

3219.28 --> 3223.3590000000004
take you

3221.28 --> 3224.48
your decision and doubling down on

3223.359 --> 3227.92
weakness

3224.48 --> 3231.2
made the demon possess you he owns you

3227.92 --> 3233.119
now right possession

3231.2 --> 3235.52
is

3233.119 --> 3237.52
there's like a deep rooted

3235.52 --> 3241.28
meaning to that word

3237.52 --> 3243.68
because it is possession he owns you now

3241.28 --> 3246.559
that spirit owns you now

3243.68 --> 3248.48
because the real you that's not in your

3246.559 --> 3250.96
body right now

3248.48 --> 3254.319
it can't deal with anything

3250.96 --> 3257.119
so it's surrendered to the demon spirit

3254.319 --> 3260.24
and that is what you are now you see has

3257.119 --> 3265.04
nothing to do with bloodline [ __ ] no

3260.24 --> 3268.0789999999997
it's a spirit and it owns you now

3265.04 --> 3270.319
you are a demon slave the demon is in

3268.079 --> 3270.319
you

3271.44 --> 3276.319
might have at some point in your life

3273.599 --> 3279.599
entered you from

3276.319 --> 3282.16
down behind if you know what i mean

3279.599 --> 3284.799
usually has an influence

3282.16 --> 3285.92
but i'm pretty sure he is right there

3284.799 --> 3288.4
right now

3285.92 --> 3293.4
because only a demon could spout out

3288.4 --> 3293.4
this level of garbage towards anybody

3293.52 --> 3296.72
what are you doing ajm

3302.48 --> 3306.72
that's right he's a suck puppet to a

3304.319 --> 3310.72
demon spirit the demon spirit doesn't

3306.72 --> 3314.0
give a [ __ ] about how bad he looks

3310.72 --> 3316.24
the demon knows he's being seen and he

3314.0 --> 3319.359
likes it he likes

3316.24 --> 3321.839
the humiliation of the person he

3319.359 --> 3321.839
possesses

3322.16 --> 3326.8799999999997
he likes the humiliation

3324.799 --> 3328.64
because the demon

3326.88 --> 3331.28
doesn't feel

3328.64 --> 3333.92
like he's actually him

3331.28 --> 3336.96
because he isn't the feelings are

3333.92 --> 3339.28
rearranged it's very deceptive

3336.96 --> 3341.92
you think that you can do all this

3339.28 --> 3344.4
because you feel it's not you it doesn't

3341.92 --> 3347.359
matter if you're caught being

3344.4 --> 3349.2000000000003
evil and lying blatantly because you

3347.359 --> 3350.799
know no shame because you don't feel

3349.2 --> 3354.319
like it's you

3350.799 --> 3354.319
but it is actually you

3354.48 --> 3358.4
you're just not in control of it anymore

3356.88 --> 3360.7200000000003
you gave it up

3358.4 --> 3362.4
gave it up to that other spirit

3360.72 --> 3364.319
because you don't know a way out you're

3362.4 --> 3365.599
trapped you are

3364.319 --> 3370.64
trapped

3365.599 --> 3370.6400000000003
and the demon has you he owns you now

3371.92 --> 3374.7200000000003
how does it feel

3374.799 --> 3380.319
how does it feel to be owned by a demon

3377.359 --> 3384.04
that literally controls your actions how

3380.319 --> 3384.04
does it feel fundy

3401.839 --> 3404.839
ah

3417.68 --> 3421.52
i mean

3419.04 --> 3423.599
i'd like to hear you guys

3421.52 --> 3426.319
about it return to normal dusty writer

3423.599 --> 3428.559
will gaston

3426.319 --> 3430.48
amanda young if you dare to get involved

3428.559 --> 3433.52
i wouldn't be surprised if you wouldn't

3430.48 --> 3434.72
agm cleary

3433.52 --> 3437.839
eric

3434.72 --> 3437.839
quadruple one

3439.119 --> 3445.28
i've been rambling like a psycho

3441.76 --> 3448.079
so was i was i actually just rambling

3445.28 --> 3451.2000000000003
because i'm supposedly triggered

3448.079 --> 3452.2400000000002
or did i actually put down a whole bunch

3451.2 --> 3456.24
of

3452.24 --> 3458.3999999999996
psychological mechanics and esoterics

3456.24 --> 3460.72
to explain

3458.4 --> 3462.64
what i actually mean

3460.72 --> 3464.3999999999996
when i say somebody is possessed by a

3462.64 --> 3467.1189999999997
demon

3464.4 --> 3469.839
was it incoherent

3467.119 --> 3472.2400000000002
was it crazy what i said or did i

3469.839 --> 3473.68
actually make a good analysis do you

3472.24 --> 3476.3999999999996
recognize

3473.68 --> 3476.3999999999996
what i said

3478.72 --> 3484.5589999999997
i'd like to hear your judgment

3482.0 --> 3486.559
let's see what flat earth cult

3484.559 --> 3490.92
flutter is a cult

3486.559 --> 3490.92
as to say a response to that

3502.24 --> 3505.24
ugh

3521.04 --> 3526.24
yes satin onion now that's right demons

3523.92 --> 3528.839
don't care about what you say

3526.24 --> 3532.9599999999996
but the thing is the demon is possessing

3528.839 --> 3532.96
him but he's still there

3533.119 --> 3536.88
right

3535.359 --> 3539.839
see it like this when somebody's

3536.88 --> 3541.28
possessed by a demon

3539.839 --> 3544.5589999999997
it's like

3541.28 --> 3546.48
they're covered in a mask and in a cage

3544.559 --> 3548.079
and the demon is right outside the cage

3546.48 --> 3549.839
and he's doing all the talking and

3548.079 --> 3551.92
everything right

3549.839 --> 3555.52
but

3551.92 --> 3557.6800000000003
the real person who's not in control

3555.52 --> 3559.599
can still hear

3557.68 --> 3563.52
still here

3559.599 --> 3563.52
they're still listening along

3563.76 --> 3568.1600000000003
because

3565.2 --> 3570.319
the real him who is not in control

3568.16 --> 3573.359
actually really wants to get out but

3570.319 --> 3574.5589999999997
hasn't known how to do that in a long

3573.359 --> 3577.92
long time

3574.559 --> 3581.76
they're actually really desperate inside

3577.92 --> 3581.76
to stop doing it you see

3583.68 --> 3589.9199999999996
so when i talk to a demon i do two

3586.88 --> 3593.599
things i try to disable the demon

3589.92 --> 3596.079
but at the same time reach the desperate

3593.599 --> 3598.4
inner individual inside never ever

3596.079 --> 3601.3590000000004
expecting him to actually

3598.4 --> 3603.6800000000003
feed back that he hurt me

3601.359 --> 3606.96
but i do expect them to listen because

3603.68 --> 3611.319
they will because it's in their interest

3606.96 --> 3611.319
you just don't get to see it

3616.72 --> 3624.359
oh what's this

3619.119 --> 3624.359
uh yeah good call there return to normal

3628.64 --> 3632.96
it's much like the venom and hostile

3630.72 --> 3635.4399999999996
that's yeah yeah

3632.96 --> 3638.04
peaceful warrior that's that's not a bad

3635.44 --> 3640.64
comparison it's very

3638.04 --> 3644.16
physicalized right demon is now a

3640.64 --> 3647.2799999999997
creature interfe but yeah if you would

3644.16 --> 3649.839
take that as a metaphor for a spirit a

3647.28 --> 3652.7200000000003
spirit from the from the inside from the

3649.839 --> 3655.68
spirit world where all the spirits are

3652.72 --> 3657.1189999999997
all the human spirits are at all time

3655.68 --> 3659.68
and other things

3657.119 --> 3661.599
other elements to us that are also tied

3659.68 --> 3663.5989999999997
in with our spirit that's where it comes

3661.599 --> 3666.4
from not from a physical thing out there

3663.599 --> 3670.079
right but the process

3666.4 --> 3673.799
is pretty much comparable

3670.079 --> 3673.799
it's not a bad metaphor

3677.17 --> 3680.2690000000002
[Music]

3684.0 --> 3687.44
hello the new pad files

3690.0 --> 3694.4
no i don't need any tips on what to call

3692.24 --> 3697.2
my show

3694.4 --> 3701.119
you see it was the title

3697.2 --> 3703.4399999999996
that triggered you in the first place

3701.119 --> 3706.799
you see the title

3703.44 --> 3706.799
is a little demon trap

3708.16 --> 3713.839
i bet you didn't expect that did you

3711.599 --> 3716.559
it was a little demon trap i was

3713.839 --> 3720.319
actually kind of counting

3716.559 --> 3720.3190000000004
on this to exactly happen

3721.68 --> 3730.2799999999997
i'll leave it to you to see

3724.88 --> 3730.28
or the others if you can figure out how

3754.72 --> 3759.2999999999997
okay flat earth is a cult

3758.0 --> 3762.399
you're welcome

3759.3 --> 3762.3990000000003
[Music]

3766.64 --> 3769.64
ah

3771.44 --> 3775.64
that was just a bonus you know

3786.4 --> 3791.119
that's hilarious there's nothing more

3788.24 --> 3791.1189999999997
hilarious than

3792.4 --> 3796.48
when demons actually try to give you

3794.64 --> 3797.92
compliments to make you stop doing what

3796.48 --> 3800.16
you do

3797.92 --> 3802.799
those are special moments

3800.16 --> 3802.799
it's all good

3805.2 --> 3811.0789999999997
you're not a demon

3806.72 --> 3811.0789999999997
i didn't say that return to normal

3813.92 --> 3818.119
you know what i'm talking about

3824.0 --> 3832.68
oh quickly bring in the stormtroopers

3827.76 --> 3832.6800000000003
need more demons by his side

3838.48 --> 3841.28
right

3839.44 --> 3843.2000000000003
if you can't defeat us maybe you could

3841.28 --> 3846.2000000000003
try to outnumber us right that's a

3843.2 --> 3846.2
tactic

3873.039 --> 3878.3190000000004
okay well flat earth is a cult hey hey

3876.799 --> 3881.119
how about uh

3878.319 --> 3883.599
the google maps you know if you're going

3881.119 --> 3884.559
to complain about ooh flat earth doesn't

3883.599 --> 3886.799
have it

3884.559 --> 3889.76
accurate yeah so how about the sphere

3886.799 --> 3891.359
map then how about the google sphere map

3889.76 --> 3896.079
why is it that

3891.359 --> 3898.16
when you go to google maps

3896.079 --> 3900.48
it looks like a sphere right when you

3898.16 --> 3902.72
zoom out it's a sphere it's all

3900.48 --> 3903.599
projected like a sphere but how come

3902.72 --> 3905.9199999999996
then

3903.599 --> 3908.0
that when you zoom in

3905.92 --> 3911.2000000000003
to a certain level and then you don't

3908.0 --> 3913.92
zoom in or out any further

3911.2 --> 3915.5989999999997
and you start scrolling

3913.92 --> 3917.599
over the earth

3915.599 --> 3919.92
over the google maps earth

3917.599 --> 3921.6800000000003
why does the scale

3919.92 --> 3924.48
change

3921.68 --> 3924.48
per region

3927.44 --> 3932.079
can you address that

3930.0 --> 3936.68
why is the

3932.079 --> 3936.6800000000003
sphere earth map

3936.72 --> 3939.52
not to scale

3939.599 --> 3942.319
what's your explanation for that for

3941.359 --> 3944.16
that

3942.319 --> 3947.2799999999997
fact

3944.16 --> 3949.52
that's a repeatable confirmable fact

3947.28 --> 3951.3590000000004
anybody can literally now in their

3949.52 --> 3954.64
browser

3951.359 --> 3954.64
go to google maps

3955.359 --> 3960.72
and do this

3957.599 --> 3964.319
you can roll around at the same apparent

3960.72 --> 3967.7599999999998
height distance to the globe model and

3964.319 --> 3970.64
then look at the right bottom corner

3967.76 --> 3976.6800000000003
and notice that the scale bar seems to

3970.64 --> 3976.68
change per region why is that pulled up

3980.24 --> 3983.24
oh

4006.4 --> 4009.4
yes

4035.799 --> 4039.359
b-i-t-e model

4040.319 --> 4044.16
according to a model i'm in a called why

4042.88 --> 4046.88
exactly

4044.16 --> 4049.839
how does that work

4046.88 --> 4052.559
where does the unconditional

4049.839 --> 4056.0789999999997
belief comes in what thing do i believe

4052.559 --> 4057.92
in that is provably untrue

4056.079 --> 4059.76
because i'm pretty sure that you're the

4057.92 --> 4060.799
one actually in a cult

4059.76 --> 4063.5200000000004
right

4060.799 --> 4065.359
the globe earth model is a cult belief

4063.52 --> 4068.48
because it's not actually backed by

4065.359 --> 4068.48
empirical facts

4069.76 --> 4075.5200000000004
that's why there's a flat earth debate

4072.079 --> 4080.3590000000004
we discuss the issues every single day

4075.52 --> 4080.359
for a couple years now you know

4091.44 --> 4095.96
shut up bobby stills stop projecting

4107.12 --> 4111.4
yeah you can get that

4119.44 --> 4123.5199999999995
there is no debate yeah that's right

4121.44 --> 4126.08
because you don't have any evidence that

4123.52 --> 4128.2390000000005
the earth is a globe every time

4126.08 --> 4129.92
we bring up

4128.239 --> 4130.839
elements

4129.92 --> 4133.4400000000005
of the

4130.839 --> 4136.239
globe and test them

4133.44 --> 4140.239
in the housekeeping questions

4136.239 --> 4142.959999999999
it's revealed for years on a daily basis

4140.239 --> 4146.239
now that there is no global that can

4142.96 --> 4150.56
properly on an academic level answer the

4146.239 --> 4150.5599999999995
questions without making a fallacy

4151.199 --> 4155.919999999999
every day

4153.759 --> 4158.319
every day

4155.92 --> 4161.359
for three years

4158.319 --> 4164.159000000001
three years every day

4161.359 --> 4167.279
every day the same questions not a

4164.159 --> 4170.08
single glober nobody not a single

4167.279 --> 4173.52
individual has ever properly answered

4170.08 --> 4176.5599999999995
the question not a single one

4173.52 --> 4179.6
three years every day three years every

4176.56 --> 4181.4400000000005
day never answered the question

4179.6 --> 4184.0
who's in a cult

4181.44 --> 4185.678999999999
who's really in a cult here

4184.0 --> 4187.279
i'm pretty sure that

4185.679 --> 4190.04
cults

4187.279 --> 4192.719
cultists are primarily

4190.04 --> 4195.44
primarily defined you don't even have to

4192.719 --> 4196.88
have any other attributes you just go to

4195.44 --> 4200.4
the one

4196.88 --> 4202.4800000000005
primary element and what is that

4200.4 --> 4203.759999999999
they can't

4202.48 --> 4208.639999999999
answer

4203.76 --> 4211.679
questions about their beliefs

4208.64 --> 4214.96
that's the primary element

4211.679 --> 4217.04
oh guess what you got

4214.96 --> 4220.64
what what do you got

4217.04 --> 4222.4
yeah yeah that's that you got that you

4220.64 --> 4225.360000000001
can't answer

4222.4 --> 4227.199
a single question about your belief your

4225.36 --> 4229.12
globe belief

4227.199 --> 4231.199
because otherwise

4229.12 --> 4235.199
the housekeeping questions would have

4231.199 --> 4238.239
been properly academically answered and

4235.199 --> 4240.0
solved and the evidence for your globe

4238.239 --> 4241.5199999999995
would have been

4240.0 --> 4244.32
presented

4241.52 --> 4246.96
to a satisfactory level and that would

4244.32 --> 4249.199
shut up the flat earthers because you

4246.96 --> 4252.08
got the facts now you got the actual

4249.199 --> 4254.719
facts now not phallus fallacious

4252.08 --> 4254.719
nonsense

4255.6 --> 4259.679
see how that works

4257.6 --> 4261.92
but you can't answer the questions you

4259.679 --> 4263.1990000000005
cannot answer the questions because the

4261.92 --> 4264.32
globe

4263.199 --> 4267.44
is

4264.32 --> 4270.88
the cult it's not just a cult right

4267.44 --> 4273.04
people can have cults about things about

4270.88 --> 4276.08
i don't look in the nature cult

4273.04 --> 4276.08
christian cults

4276.239 --> 4279.36
crazy death cult there's all kinds of

4278.48 --> 4281.759999999999
cults

4279.36 --> 4282.639999999999
about elements right

4281.76 --> 4284.56
but

4282.64 --> 4287.6
none are out there

4284.56 --> 4290.96
like the globe earth cult

4287.6 --> 4294.0
which is enormous and encompasses the

4290.96 --> 4296.08
entire fabric of reality being turned

4294.0 --> 4297.52
inside out everything that is real

4296.08 --> 4300.239
hidden

4297.52 --> 4302.96
and the worst most nonsensical [ __ ]

4300.239 --> 4307.04
shoved in your face to numb you down and

4302.96 --> 4308.0
make you intellectually surrender

4307.04 --> 4312.0
which is

4308.0 --> 4313.92
the primary mechanism in a cult

4312.0 --> 4316.32
to get people into it to make them

4313.92 --> 4320.0
intellectually surrender

4316.32 --> 4321.12
to no longer ask the questions about the

4320.0 --> 4323.04
belief

4321.12 --> 4325.84
and just act

4323.04 --> 4329.679
as the belief dictates

4325.84 --> 4332.4800000000005
what you need to do and you don't ask

4329.679 --> 4336.08
anymore why you do it you just do it

4332.48 --> 4337.678999999999
because you're not allowed to ask

4336.08 --> 4341.12
the critical

4337.679 --> 4342.8
cornerstone questions about your belief

4341.12 --> 4345.36
you're not supposed to question that so

4342.8 --> 4351.400000000001
that when flat earthers do it

4345.36 --> 4351.4
you avoid it to no end to no end

4365.6 --> 4371.84
yeah i'm sorry dude science is not a

4368.08 --> 4373.28
democracy it's based on empirical facts

4371.84 --> 4377.679
not

4373.28 --> 4382.5199999999995
peer reviews and a majority of believers

4377.679 --> 4382.52
that's a religion that's a cult

4385.92 --> 4388.2390000000005
ah

4388.56 --> 4394.0
let him squirm let him squirm let him

4391.28 --> 4394.0
squirm

4394.56 --> 4399.84
yeah save my name fundy say my name

4397.28 --> 4399.84
keep chanting

4400.0 --> 4404.48
i'm just doing this for bonus

4401.84 --> 4404.4800000000005
entertainment

4406.0 --> 4409.679
you need to control this no i'm just

4407.84 --> 4411.52
leaving the one here you know if there's

4409.679 --> 4413.92
other nonsense in there i'm just gonna

4411.52 --> 4417.4400000000005
kick them out

4413.92 --> 4419.36
but now flat earth is a cult is in here

4417.44 --> 4420.5599999999995
and hey would do you good to just deal

4419.36 --> 4424.5599999999995
with it

4420.56 --> 4424.56
right this is this is training

4425.84 --> 4429.400000000001
this is all training

4449.28 --> 4453.599999999999
yeah that's right no it's not a globe

4451.36 --> 4455.36
you're not a glober you're a freak

4453.6 --> 4458.320000000001
you're a demon possessed little

4455.36 --> 4461.599999999999
anti-flat earth or a [ __ ] of a person

4458.32 --> 4463.44
that's what you are flat earth is a call

4461.6 --> 4466.0
you're a maggot

4463.44 --> 4468.5599999999995
metaphorically

4466.0 --> 4470.32
right there's no more corpse to feed on

4468.56 --> 4473.92
unfortunately

4470.32 --> 4473.92
this body ain't that maggot

4474.48 --> 4478.28
you got nowhere to go

4486.48 --> 4489.48
so

4507.76 --> 4511.84
no that's not how you spell it

4525.76 --> 4529.360000000001
all right okay i'm done now

4530.8 --> 4536.320000000001
okay i feel like an hour

4533.28 --> 4538.48
but it was entertaining while it lasted

4536.32 --> 4540.88
now you can just sink back into the

4538.48 --> 4540.879999999999
swamp

4541.04 --> 4544.4
because there was only gonna be [ __ ]

4542.719 --> 4547.44
coming out of you after that point

4544.4 --> 4549.839999999999
anyway right you already gave me the

4547.44 --> 4553.12
desperate compliment to try and make me

4549.84 --> 4554.4800000000005
stop and i didn't stop of course

4553.12 --> 4557.5199999999995
because

4554.48 --> 4562.4
i don't give quarter to demons

4557.52 --> 4562.400000000001
to demon spirits reifying idiot

4565.6 --> 4568.97
ah

4565.86 --> 4568.969999999999
[Applause]

4569.28 --> 4571.5199999999995
right

4572.239 --> 4575.199
so yeah what else

4575.36 --> 4582.589999999999
what else can we talk about

4578.95 --> 4582.59
[Music]

4601.199 --> 4605.919999999999
right well return to normal it you know

4603.6 --> 4608.719
it's really grounded in desperation

4605.92 --> 4612.4800000000005
though

4608.719 --> 4612.4800000000005
it's mostly just desperation

4612.64 --> 4617.84
and that is what it is right that's the

4614.96 --> 4620.32
demon demon has

4617.84 --> 4622.56
a lot of playing room

4620.32 --> 4624.88
when the individual is so desperate that

4622.56 --> 4626.080000000001
they'll let the demon do whatever it

4624.88 --> 4629.8
wants

4626.08 --> 4629.8
despite the humiliation

4630.08 --> 4633.679
right that's how that works

4635.04 --> 4640.64
it's just pure pure desperation and

4637.84 --> 4642.56
inability to just confront themselves

4640.64 --> 4644.08
right they're being metaphorically

4642.56 --> 4645.84
bashed in the face they're being

4644.08 --> 4648.08
tortured

4645.84 --> 4650.32
through their inability to deal with

4648.08 --> 4652.88
reality and the consequences of

4650.32 --> 4654.5599999999995
everything they've done all the lying

4652.88 --> 4655.52
can't see it anymore it's all white

4654.56 --> 4657.1990000000005
noise

4655.52 --> 4659.76
so they just

4657.199 --> 4661.839999999999
surrender to the demon

4659.76 --> 4664.8
it just starts barfing out garbage and

4661.84 --> 4669.04
lies in 180 degree projections

4664.8 --> 4671.28
constantly non-stop systematically

4669.04 --> 4673.76
very predictable

4671.28 --> 4679.639999999999
and that's how you recognize it even

4673.76 --> 4679.64
the 180 degree non-stop projections

4712.0 --> 4718.48
oh really no scientists backing

4716.199 --> 4719.36
interpretations of science oh you mean

4718.48 --> 4722.32
the

4719.36 --> 4723.5199999999995
scientific method

4722.32 --> 4726.0
ah

4723.52 --> 4727.92
are we gonna go there again you dummy

4726.0 --> 4730.159
you're really gonna go all all the way

4727.92 --> 4732.96
over there

4730.159 --> 4736.159
yeah science is a method it's a bad

4732.96 --> 4739.84
method based on empiricism

4736.159 --> 4742.48
which primary objective is to determine

4739.84 --> 4744.56
the cause of a naturally occurring

4742.48 --> 4747.678999999999
phenomenon

4744.56 --> 4752.64
by manipulating it as the experimenter

4747.679 --> 4754.2390000000005
the scientific method that is science

4752.64 --> 4758.159000000001
everything else

4754.239 --> 4761.199
that doesn't utilize that very specific

4758.159 --> 4763.839999999999
method mechanism

4761.199 --> 4765.599999999999
is pseudoscience if you claim

4763.84 --> 4768.400000000001
to know things

4765.6 --> 4771.96
without empirical evidence

4768.4 --> 4771.96
it's pseudoscience

4772.64 --> 4777.04
see

4774.0 --> 4780.159
and everybody can agree on the same

4777.04 --> 4781.84
virtual mechanics models

4780.159 --> 4784.5599999999995
calculus

4781.84 --> 4787.12
that's not science

4784.56 --> 4788.84
only empirical

4787.12 --> 4792.32
testing

4788.84 --> 4792.32
categorizes science

4792.8 --> 4796.96
virtual things

4794.719 --> 4799.52
math

4796.96 --> 4802.0
none of those have anything to do with

4799.52 --> 4802.0
science

4803.36 --> 4809.759999999999
but i know it was just very easy for the

4807.52 --> 4813.120000000001
globe cult

4809.76 --> 4815.4400000000005
to gradually loosen those bonds of

4813.12 --> 4816.88
science to make it non-empirical

4815.44 --> 4820.08
suddenly now

4816.88 --> 4822.56
really interesting sounding ideas that

4820.08 --> 4823.679
had historical reference to actual

4822.56 --> 4826.0
science

4823.679 --> 4829.36
would also be signs you don't have to do

4826.0 --> 4830.84
empiricism anymore according to popular

4829.36 --> 4833.839999999999
scientists

4830.84 --> 4835.12
popularized science right

4833.84 --> 4837.1990000000005
yeah yeah

4835.12 --> 4839.84
that's pseudoscience

4837.199 --> 4843.12
it's the pseudoscience cult

4839.84 --> 4846.12
laying the groundworks for your demonic

4843.12 --> 4846.12
escapism

4846.719 --> 4853.92
give enabling it right make giving you

4850.08 --> 4856.96
the enab enabling it for you

4853.92 --> 4858.0
making it possible for you to

4856.96 --> 4861.199
not

4858.0 --> 4864.239
actually be scientific but still call

4861.199 --> 4866.799999999999
yourself scientific and if enough people

4864.239 --> 4868.638999999999
agree to that notion then you are

4866.8 --> 4873.04
scientific

4868.639 --> 4875.679
by priestly decorate declaration

4873.04 --> 4878.719
right but actual science

4875.679 --> 4880.4800000000005
requires empiricism it requires you to

4878.719 --> 4882.88
first establish

4880.48 --> 4885.28
the cause of an effect

4882.88 --> 4887.76
based on a naturally occurring

4885.28 --> 4890.08
phenomenon that you as the experimenter

4887.76 --> 4892.56
have to vary and manipulate

4890.08 --> 4895.679
in order to successfully prove the

4892.56 --> 4898.400000000001
hypothesis the cause of the effect

4895.679 --> 4900.4800000000005
that is science

4898.4 --> 4903.36
anything else that claims to be science

4900.48 --> 4904.48
but does not utilize the scientific

4903.36 --> 4906.639
method

4904.48 --> 4908.08
is not science

4906.639 --> 4909.84
it's

4908.08 --> 4912.0
very specific actually that if you

4909.84 --> 4913.6
declare that science

4912.0 --> 4915.12
while leaving out the

4913.6 --> 4917.76
scientific method

4915.12 --> 4918.96
it makes it specifically pseudoscience

4917.76 --> 4920.2390000000005
right

4918.96 --> 4922.8
that's why you have to be kind of

4920.239 --> 4924.959999999999
careful to even declare science right

4922.8 --> 4927.1990000000005
you could say this is data or this is a

4924.96 --> 4929.04
good model this seemed to work

4927.199 --> 4931.678999999999
right

4929.04 --> 4934.719
i try to do that i don't declare science

4931.679 --> 4937.36
but if i find good data or good ideas or

4934.719 --> 4940.56
conceptions i will bring them forth and

4937.36 --> 4942.96
i will try to relay its value within the

4940.56 --> 4944.8
wider context of things

4942.96 --> 4947.159
but i'm not just going to declare

4944.8 --> 4949.92
science because that's kind of the

4947.159 --> 4952.239
popularized thing to do

4949.92 --> 4953.84
because that would make me a pseudo

4952.239 --> 4956.839999999999
scientist

4953.84 --> 4956.84
right

4965.84 --> 4969.76
science has feel there no it hasn't

4970.239 --> 4974.799999999999
that's the thing about science it can't

4972.48 --> 4974.799999999999
fail

4974.96 --> 4980.88
the method can't fail

4977.52 --> 4983.52
it always yields a result

4980.88 --> 4987.84
proves or disproves the hypothesis it

4983.52 --> 4987.84
can't fail it always succeeds

4990.239 --> 4993.919999999999
you see

4991.44 --> 4996.4
but yeah if you start to call yourself

4993.92 --> 4998.2390000000005
scientists or science

4996.4 --> 5000.719
or whatever

4998.239 --> 5004.0
related to science but you don't

5000.719 --> 5006.2390000000005
actually utilize the scientific method

5004.0 --> 5009.04
in whatever you declare science then you

5006.239 --> 5010.959999999999
are a pseudo-scientist

5009.04 --> 5013.679
it's pseudoscience

5010.96 --> 5015.28
it's make-believe science claiming to be

5013.679 --> 5018.08
signs when it's not

5015.28 --> 5020.239
because the critical components

5018.08 --> 5024.0
are missing

5020.239 --> 5024.0
for it to be called science

5025.679 --> 5032.719
endure scientists endorse oh that's so

5028.719 --> 5035.92
cute well endorsement doesn't have [ __ ]

5032.719 --> 5039.28
to do with science you dummy

5035.92 --> 5041.04
who gives a [ __ ] about who endorses what

5039.28 --> 5045.679
what does that have to do with science

5041.04 --> 5046.639
nothing only thing that actually works

5045.679 --> 5050.4
is

5046.639 --> 5053.4400000000005
repeating the experiment

5050.4 --> 5056.879999999999
concluding the same physical empirical

5053.44 --> 5060.159
results and being able to present that

5056.88 --> 5062.159000000001
that's the only legitimate thing

5060.159 --> 5065.239
that makes something science

5062.159 --> 5066.879999999999
not agreement

5065.239 --> 5069.36
endorsement

5066.88 --> 5072.2390000000005
peer review none of that is science it's

5069.36 --> 5072.239
all garbage

5084.32 --> 5087.32
okay

5110.56 --> 5114.0
this

5112.159 --> 5117.599999999999
no fundy

5114.0 --> 5119.92
voyager 2 are you are you the same funny

5117.6 --> 5121.84
because you talk just as much demonic

5119.92 --> 5124.719
[ __ ]

5121.84 --> 5124.719
as the other guy

5125.44 --> 5129.759999999999
weirdo

5127.36 --> 5132.4
you're literally just blurting out

5129.76 --> 5135.12
psychotic garbage now

5132.4 --> 5137.36
science proof girl gravity is so

5135.12 --> 5139.199
ridiculous

5137.36 --> 5141.36
science doesn't even

5139.199 --> 5143.12
have any clear-cut recognition as to

5141.36 --> 5145.44
what gravity is

5143.12 --> 5148.32
right currently it's assumed to be

5145.44 --> 5150.879999999999
einstein gravity

5148.32 --> 5152.84
it it doesn't even have a physical real

5150.88 --> 5156.8
world empirical

5152.84 --> 5159.1990000000005
relation it's completely conceptual

5156.8 --> 5161.52
did you know that in physics

5159.199 --> 5164.719
universities and [ __ ]

5161.52 --> 5166.56
people still like even hand out

5164.719 --> 5170.0
grants

5166.56 --> 5172.159000000001
for students that are willing to

5170.0 --> 5174.8
figure out

5172.159 --> 5176.32
what gravity is

5174.8 --> 5177.92
okay

5176.32 --> 5181.199
officially

5177.92 --> 5183.6
officially it's not even proven it's not

5181.199 --> 5186.48
a proven theory

5183.6 --> 5188.4800000000005
it's just a concept they don't actually

5186.48 --> 5191.599999999999
have the evidence

5188.48 --> 5194.5599999999995
it's not empirical gravity is not

5191.6 --> 5198.320000000001
scientific people are still doing

5194.56 --> 5201.52
studies to try to prove it exists in

5198.32 --> 5203.84
some bizarre way based on crazy ass

5490.159 --> 5493.36

5528.4 --> 5533.759999999999
of the globe of the heavens

5578.48 --> 5584.0
little societal paper system

5582.159 --> 5586.5599999999995
because i don't cuck for the system i

5584.0 --> 5588.239
have refused to spread propaganda and

5586.56 --> 5590.080000000001
lies

5588.239 --> 5592.48
that doesn't mean i'm not an expert

5590.08 --> 5595.84
because i'm a testable expert you can

5592.48 --> 5595.839999999999
literally test me

5596.159 --> 5600.839999999999
right

5597.44 --> 5602.4
basic physics real physics the real

5600.84 --> 5604.639
stuff

the stuff that everybody should be

5604.639 --> 5607.04
learning

5608.96 --> 5615.4800000000005
i train it every day

5611.76 --> 5615.4800000000005
every single day

5618.4 --> 5624.4
i don't give a flying [ __ ] what you

5621.6 --> 5628.0
think i am or not supposed to be i

5624.4 --> 5630.638999999999
really don't care dude get out

5628.0 --> 5633.04
you're a scumbag i don't care if you

5630.639 --> 5635.12
have some kind of paper or something if

5633.04 --> 5637.76
this is what you do

5635.12 --> 5640.719
you don't deserve anything

5637.76 --> 5642.320000000001
any paper any title you should just put

5640.719 --> 5644.639
it in a bin

5642.32 --> 5646.239
and burn it all because you're not worth

5644.639 --> 5649.1990000000005
it

5646.239 --> 5652.799999999999
i wouldn't want you to actually deal

5649.199 --> 5655.759999999999
with people in any form

5652.8 --> 5657.679
be it over the internet

5655.76 --> 5660.0
be it face to face

5657.679 --> 5662.08
i wouldn't want people that act like the

5660.0 --> 5665.679
demons in this chat

5662.08 --> 5668.0
to be near anybody that i cared about

5665.679 --> 5671.12
because you're a scumbag

5668.0 --> 5672.88
you're a rotten

5671.12 --> 5674.32
spoiled

5672.88 --> 5676.8
demonic

5674.32 --> 5680.96
scum bag

5676.8 --> 5682.96
and you should be isolated from society

5680.96 --> 5684.88
for up to me

5682.96 --> 5687.84
it's good that it isn't

5684.88 --> 5690.0
i would have you traced

5687.84 --> 5691.76
and then marked

5690.0 --> 5693.6
to have

5691.76 --> 5698.56
complete

5693.6 --> 5702.96
cut off from all internet and telephone

5698.56 --> 5705.52
and activities ever and if you're caught

5702.96 --> 5710.2390000000005
you will be arrested how about that you

5705.52 --> 5710.2390000000005
[ __ ] scumbag how about that

5711.119 --> 5715.199
have you

5712.84 --> 5716.719
isolated as punishment for your

5715.199 --> 5718.4
disgusting

5716.719 --> 5721.4
online behavior

5718.4 --> 5721.4
isolated

5731.44 --> 5736.48
i'll buy you coffee next week that's all

5733.44 --> 5736.48
fine drunken bullet

5738.159 --> 5743.08
don't worry about it

5739.6 --> 5743.08
i'm just saying

5744.159 --> 5749.199
can you please

5745.52 --> 5750.4800000000005
just get these [ __ ] out of the chat

5749.199 --> 5752.879999999999
quickly

5750.48 --> 5755.28
just start blocking just blah blah blah

5752.88 --> 5757.84
blah blah soon as you see it's some if

5755.28 --> 5759.199
you see it's a troll just get him out

5757.84 --> 5761.28
immediately

5759.199 --> 5763.04
it's the same person it's one piece of

5761.28 --> 5765.599999999999
[ __ ]

5763.04 --> 5769.96
one [ __ ] scumbag

5765.6 --> 5769.96
and he needs to get the [ __ ] out

5777.679 --> 5780.679
right

5795.6 --> 5799.159000000001
thank you for that

5822.239 --> 5827.718999999999
yeah and thanks for your concern by the

5824.48 --> 5827.718999999999
way mark

5827.76 --> 5830.88
but

5828.56 --> 5833.52
it was kind of worth it it was worth

5830.88 --> 5836.400000000001
laying out the psychology

5833.52 --> 5838.159000000001
and i know that when you squish a

5836.4 --> 5840.159
cockroach

5838.159 --> 5842.48
you usually end up with even more

5840.159 --> 5844.48
cockroaches but sometimes you just gotta

5842.48 --> 5846.5599999999995
show them what is what

5844.48 --> 5849.119
right

5846.56 --> 5852.56
sometimes you gotta show like see this

5849.119 --> 5852.5599999999995
is one of those bastards

5853.44 --> 5857.599999999999
and basically help you

5856.0 --> 5860.239
identify

5857.6 --> 5864.2390000000005
how their inner workings are

5860.239 --> 5865.799999999999
and even give you some consolidation

5864.239 --> 5869.199
because of how

5865.8 --> 5873.84
unbelievably miserable they really are

5869.199 --> 5877.199
right i find that relieving to realize

5873.84 --> 5879.6
that for all the pain they try to spread

5877.199 --> 5881.919999999999
they are the ones in the most pain and

5879.6 --> 5884.639
it's not just a funny saying that nathan

5881.92 --> 5887.04
oakley does they are actually provably

5884.639 --> 5888.719
probably measurably

5887.04 --> 5890.96
in pain

5888.719 --> 5893.04
you could probably literally tap their

5890.96 --> 5895.28
blood as they're doing it

5893.04 --> 5899.199
and it would reveal that they are

5895.28 --> 5902.96
literally having pain stress hormones

5899.199 --> 5905.28
right they suffer they provably

5902.96 --> 5907.199
suffer

5905.28 --> 5909.719
and that is

5907.199 --> 5912.159
i guess a little bit of a

5909.719 --> 5915.119
consolidation price you know if they are

5912.159 --> 5916.96
going to be [ __ ] scumbags you know

5915.119 --> 5921.44
and then at least

5916.96 --> 5923.92
i know they suffer more than i do

5921.44 --> 5927.08
right it's the one thing that makes it

5923.92 --> 5927.08
all right

5929.84 --> 5932.909000000001
[Applause]

5940.08 --> 5944.6
no agm it's all just one guy

5961.679 --> 5966.96
it's one guy all of this one guy

5964.639 --> 5970.0
and no life scumbag piece of [ __ ]

5966.96 --> 5972.4800000000005
probably satanist probably

5970.0 --> 5974.08
dark connections has seen so much [ __ ]

5972.48 --> 5975.678999999999
he can never

5974.08 --> 5978.8
awaken

5975.679 --> 5979.6
from his demonic nightmare ever again

5978.8 --> 5983.04
because

5979.6 --> 5985.119000000001
if you have this type of ability

5983.04 --> 5987.6
to go this far that usually means

5985.119 --> 5990.08
there's no way back for them so they are

5987.6 --> 5992.0
quite literally in hell the rest of

5990.08 --> 5996.639
their lives

5992.0 --> 5998.08
right how we like to imagine sometimes

5996.639 --> 6000.2390000000005
like oh

5998.08 --> 6002.5599999999995
they're in hell after death and all the

6000.239 --> 6005.5199999999995
burning like well

6002.56 --> 6010.56
have you ever considered that

6005.52 --> 6013.52
that is their inner time-based

6010.56 --> 6016.0
real-world experience like they actually

6013.52 --> 6017.679
experience that as a metaphor on the

6016.0 --> 6019.44
inside

6017.679 --> 6020.32
when they're like that you know when you

6019.44 --> 6022.48
are

6020.32 --> 6026.4
like possessed by a demon

6022.48 --> 6029.119
that usually means that the actual you

6026.4 --> 6033.36
is in hell

6029.119 --> 6035.5199999999995
you exchange places

6033.36 --> 6038.88
demon comes from hell

6035.52 --> 6038.88
and you go to hell

6039.92 --> 6043.04
right

6041.199 --> 6044.799999999999
because in my

6043.04 --> 6047.679
humble opinion

6044.8 --> 6050.719
i'm not too sure about this hell after

6047.679 --> 6053.679
death right or maybe for some really

6050.719 --> 6056.4
totally overboard psychotic killer

6053.679 --> 6059.4400000000005
maniac freaks

6056.4 --> 6060.239
i don't know god is just he gives it

6059.44 --> 6063.36
just

6060.239 --> 6066.48
reward and punishment for everybody

6063.36 --> 6067.759999999999
but i'm pretty sure that hell is also a

6066.48 --> 6069.36
place

6067.76 --> 6072.719
a frequency

6069.36 --> 6075.679
that you experience while alive just as

6072.719 --> 6078.88
heaven is also a frequency you can

6075.679 --> 6081.04
experience while alive

6078.88 --> 6083.92
that's the enlightenment it's the

6081.04 --> 6087.04
miracles of the revealing

6083.92 --> 6089.04
of god's glory

6087.04 --> 6090.88
that is kind of angelic

6089.04 --> 6094.56
just as the

6090.88 --> 6095.92
sinking into the deepest pharisaic pit

6094.56 --> 6099.119000000001
of hell

6095.92 --> 6102.08
is a living experience

6099.119 --> 6105.28
your spirit literally goes out of your

6102.08 --> 6108.5599999999995
body to that frequency to hell

6105.28 --> 6109.84
it dwells in hell as the demon takes the

6108.56 --> 6112.96
reign

6109.84 --> 6115.96
and does its demonic thing in a physical

6112.96 --> 6115.96
experience

6133.04 --> 6137.639
hey hello i'm andy young welcome back

6150.719 --> 6155.28
all right

6152.0 --> 6158.56
so yeah little demon boy

6155.28 --> 6163.8
your secret's out we know your spirit is

6158.56 --> 6163.8
in hell we know you experience the pain

6164.48 --> 6167.5199999999995
and it makes you

6168.0 --> 6171.119
break your mind

6170.159 --> 6172.5599999999995
because

6171.119 --> 6173.839999999999
when you're in hell

6172.56 --> 6177.119000000001
the only

6173.84 --> 6180.400000000001
recourse left is ignorance

6177.119 --> 6183.199
and all ignorance leads to death

6180.4 --> 6183.199
to death

6183.36 --> 6188.159
first the death of the mind

6185.679 --> 6192.56
then the death of the body

6188.159 --> 6194.5599999999995
and then the death of the soul

6192.56 --> 6195.84
i don't even know where you go after

6194.56 --> 6199.04
that

6195.84 --> 6201.84
i don't think there is even like a

6199.04 --> 6203.5199999999995
a metaphysical place

6201.84 --> 6206.08
as hell

6203.52 --> 6208.320000000001
post life i think it's the abyss i think

6206.08 --> 6210.08
it's the absolute vacuum

6208.32 --> 6213.36
because you've

6210.08 --> 6216.0
destroyed anything

6213.36 --> 6218.32
that would carry you into a meaningful

6216.0 --> 6220.239
spiritual afterlife

6218.32 --> 6222.88
you'll let it all burn up you let it be

6220.239 --> 6225.119
taken by the demon so you experience

6222.88 --> 6226.8
hell during life

6225.119 --> 6230.32
and then after

6226.8 --> 6230.320000000001
you go to the abyss

6230.8 --> 6233.8
um

6235.52 --> 6238.2390000000005
then you can be

6238.4 --> 6243.28
in silence

6241.36 --> 6244.96
and darkness

6243.28 --> 6246.48
and void

6244.96 --> 6247.84
consciously

6246.48 --> 6249.36
time mount

6247.84 --> 6252.159000000001
forever

6249.36 --> 6254.48
how about that [ __ ]

6252.159 --> 6256.719
was it worth it for you oh you think you

6254.48 --> 6258.4
can handle hell that you experience

6256.719 --> 6260.4800000000005
during your life

6258.4 --> 6262.0
you think you can handle that well guess

6260.48 --> 6266.239
what that's not where you're gonna end

6262.0 --> 6268.32
up that's not gonna be the oh extreme

6266.239 --> 6271.199
theme park whatever

6268.32 --> 6272.48
afterlife no no it's abyss

6271.199 --> 6274.32
abyss

6272.48 --> 6277.36
nothing

6274.32 --> 6279.119
waking eternal black

6277.36 --> 6281.839999999999
nothing

6279.119 --> 6284.839999999999
how are you going to enjoy that

6281.84 --> 6284.84
huh

6290.32 --> 6293.36
no i'm too quick

6299.76 --> 6303.76
oh double jab do you wanna you wanna get

6301.84 --> 6306.2390000000005
kicked i thought you were actually gonna

6303.76 --> 6308.0
try to be a real person in my chat but

6306.239 --> 6310.5599999999995
if that's gonna be what you're gonna say

6308.0 --> 6313.44
i'm gonna just kick you

6310.56 --> 6316.080000000001
so you wanna be here

6313.44 --> 6317.759999999999
like bad karma and tiny womble before

6316.08 --> 6319.28
him you want to be here

6317.76 --> 6323.280000000001
you got to behave if you're going to get

6319.28 --> 6323.28
like this i will freaking kick you

6324.48 --> 6328.718999999999
you understand double jab

6326.88 --> 6330.8
you want to be here in the chat or you

6328.719 --> 6333.28
want to be kicked out like a troll it's

6330.8 --> 6333.28
up to you

6333.36 --> 6337.759999999999
all right that's good

6335.84 --> 6340.96
i still think your icon is disgusting

6337.76 --> 6340.96
though but let's

6341.36 --> 6346.32
for another time

6343.36 --> 6348.4
yeah and bobby stills you're still and

6346.32 --> 6350.5599999999995
not and you're on slippery ground and

6348.4 --> 6353.679
you will be for a while

6350.56 --> 6357.56
you don't get a a stable spot here

6353.679 --> 6357.56
because i find you repulsive

6363.199 --> 6366.199
uh

6372.88 --> 6377.52
all right yeah so

6375.44 --> 6379.48
the spherical geometry has been

6377.52 --> 6380.96
optically defiled

6379.48 --> 6381.759999999999
[Music]

6380.96 --> 6384.159
and

6381.76 --> 6386.88
yeah that that brings out some demons

6384.159 --> 6389.839999999999
doesn't it

6386.88 --> 6392.88
specifically designed that sentence is

6389.84 --> 6395.4400000000005
specifically designed to summon them

6392.88 --> 6397.679
to bring those things forth to bring the

6395.44 --> 6401.04
deepest pit

6397.679 --> 6401.76
do you understand why do you understand

6401.04 --> 6405.92
why

6401.76 --> 6405.92
this sentence specifically

6406.96 --> 6409.52
think about it

6410.159 --> 6414.799999999999
you should have been seeing this for for

6412.8 --> 6417.119000000001
some time

6414.8 --> 6420.360000000001
but i'm gonna leave it to you to think

6417.119 --> 6420.36
about it

6430.56 --> 6434.719
yep that's that's right clap ruckus

6435.36 --> 6439.5599999999995
it's up to them though you know

6447.679 --> 6451.28
right you make the mistake you get the

6449.84 --> 6455.04
punishment

6451.28 --> 6458.4
or you get really really lucky

6455.04 --> 6460.96
and then you better thank god for that

6458.4 --> 6463.28
right because just because you take the

6460.96 --> 6466.96
v doesn't mean that you're automatically

6463.28 --> 6469.199
like marked by the beast and doomed

6466.96 --> 6471.44
to hell or anything

6469.199 --> 6472.719
but yeah you might

6471.44 --> 6474.879999999999
go

6472.719 --> 6476.96
very likely actually you might go

6474.88 --> 6478.08
through a period at some point where you

6476.96 --> 6480.0
will

6478.08 --> 6482.4
experience

6480.0 --> 6484.239
certain degrees of anguish

6482.4 --> 6486.32
there will be a punishment for your

6484.239 --> 6489.119
actions within your life

6486.32 --> 6490.799999999999
that's the design that's how god works

6489.119 --> 6493.679
through the design

6490.8 --> 6496.639
if you make a mistake then you will pay

6493.679 --> 6499.28
for the sin within your lifetime

6496.639 --> 6500.88
and if you're really lucky

6499.28 --> 6502.96
you took the v

6500.88 --> 6505.679
then you might

6502.96 --> 6508.719
somehow be spared the anguish that a

6505.679 --> 6512.159
whole bunch of them will experience

6508.719 --> 6515.6
in just a matter of time

6512.159 --> 6515.599999999999
but not everybody i believe

6517.119 --> 6523.119
you had the polio vaccine and it worked

6519.119 --> 6523.119
what you mean you got paralyzed

6524.08 --> 6528.639
because that what that's what it does

6526.48 --> 6530.959999999999
polio doesn't even exist if it weren't

6528.639 --> 6533.96
for the freaking vaccines

6530.96 --> 6533.96
literally

6540.88 --> 6546.119
ah [ __ ] now i said it out loud whatever

6566.719 --> 6569.84
oh come on

6570.32 --> 6573.32
right

6588.56 --> 6594.88
well yes agent yeah you can get polio

6591.76 --> 6599.52
but those conditions are extremely rare

6594.88 --> 6603.04
now you have to get to really trashed

6599.52 --> 6604.400000000001
third world countries or like disaster

6603.04 --> 6606.8
areas right

6604.4 --> 6609.04
so if a city for example gets a giant

6606.8 --> 6612.159000000001
earthquake and the sewers break

6609.04 --> 6614.159
yeah there might if it's not cleaned up

6612.159 --> 6615.36
and dealt with properly quickly there

6614.159 --> 6618.159
might

6615.36 --> 6620.5599999999995
come a polio outbreak from that

6618.159 --> 6622.719
right but you have to get really bad

6620.56 --> 6625.280000000001
conditions in order to make that

6622.719 --> 6627.199
condition arise naturally

6625.28 --> 6629.5199999999995
if you don't have that then yeah the

6627.199 --> 6631.04
freaking fees

6629.52 --> 6633.84
will cause it

6631.04 --> 6636.0
historically proven yet the data is

6633.84 --> 6638.0
there it does cause it

6636.0 --> 6642.0
even if there are not the natural

6638.0 --> 6645.92
conditions for that disease to arrive

6642.0 --> 6645.92
and that's just a historical fact

6647.199 --> 6650.199
uh

6658.48 --> 6660.959999999999
all right

6659.599 --> 6664.32
i think i'm gonna round out the show

6660.96 --> 6664.32
it's been a good show very

6664.719 --> 6669.119
very on the trolls

6666.88 --> 6671.4400000000005
i think he's moved on now finally he's

6669.119 --> 6673.36
got a life nah who am i kidding he's

6671.44 --> 6675.839999999999
just moved on probably to the flat earth

6673.36 --> 6675.839999999999
debates

6676.32 --> 6682.0
so he can score more

6679.679 --> 6684.96
privately in the open without

6682.0 --> 6687.679
getting grilled specifically by me

6684.96 --> 6687.679
constantly

6688.239 --> 6691.839999999999
because it does get to them even if they

6690.0 --> 6695.0
can't express it because the demon is in

6691.84 --> 6695.0
the throne

6697.84 --> 6701.04
hey steamy traveler you made it no you

6700.0 --> 6704.8
didn't

6701.04 --> 6704.8
i'm just gonna run out the show now

6705.52 --> 6710.400000000001
it was a very trolly show though today i

6708.8 --> 6712.4800000000005
don't know if you would have appreciated

6710.4 --> 6712.48
it

6715.28 --> 6720.239
didn't you do the show until four

6721.44 --> 6723.839999999999
no

6727.92 --> 6735.36
it's from 1pm amsterdam time

6731.92 --> 6738.32
to 3 pm amsterdam time

6735.36 --> 6741.5199999999995
my show has been running for an hour and

6738.32 --> 6741.5199999999995
50 minutes now

6741.92 --> 6745.599
it was never too far

6745.76 --> 6749.679
maybe in the past on a very rare

6747.76 --> 6752.0
occasion if nathan didn't do a live

6749.679 --> 6754.2390000000005
stream or something then i might just

6752.0 --> 6756.719
continue the stream but that's not the

6754.239 --> 6760.199
normal time normally i end at 3 pm

6756.719 --> 6760.199
amsterdam time

6765.52 --> 6770.96
lots of mosquitoes well mostly one

6768.4 --> 6773.5199999999995
freaking horsefly

6770.96 --> 6776.2390000000005
and i did a very elaborate

6773.52 --> 6776.2390000000005
analysis

6777.04 --> 6781.44
very elaborate pretty much lasting an

6779.36 --> 6782.96
hour

6781.44 --> 6787.96
so i don't know if you'd have

6782.96 --> 6787.96
appreciated but i did do my best though

6795.679 --> 6797.92
no

6797.04 --> 6799.04
no

6797.92 --> 6801.119
agm

6799.04 --> 6803.679
no

6801.119 --> 6805.36
no no no no

6803.679 --> 6809.04
i'm not

6805.36 --> 6811.04
gonna go stream on my own live show past

6809.04 --> 6814.28
three as a standard i'm just not gonna

6811.04 --> 6814.28
do that

6824.0 --> 6829.119
besides after that time i look

6826.88 --> 6830.56
you do realize i'm basically

6829.119 --> 6833.839999999999
talking

6830.56 --> 6836.2390000000005
presenting being on screen

6833.84 --> 6838.639
it's it's a very active

6836.239 --> 6840.718999999999
thing right when i get on like the flat

6838.639 --> 6842.4800000000005
earth debates

6840.719 --> 6845.28
i can just sit in the background and

6842.48 --> 6847.759999999999
like get lunch and do groceries right

6845.28 --> 6850.48
it's not so strenuous i couldn't like do

6847.76 --> 6852.88
another hour as a standard

6850.48 --> 6855.5199999999995
on top of this activity it's too

6852.88 --> 6855.52
tiresome

6856.239 --> 6859.5199999999995
right i might make it look really

6858.32 --> 6861.28
smoothly

6859.52 --> 6863.119000000001
it doesn't mean it doesn't cost me

6861.28 --> 6864.159
energy to do it

6863.119 --> 6866.48
i mean i've

6864.159 --> 6868.799999999999
gotten pretty efficient at it but it

6866.48 --> 6871.598999999999
still requires energy and it doesn't

6868.8 --> 6871.599
last forever

6871.92 --> 6876.0
right i'm already glad i can freaking do

6874.0 --> 6878.239
this every day

6876.0 --> 6880.32
very happy with that

6878.239 --> 6882.5599999999995
