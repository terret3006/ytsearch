83.939 --> 89.39999999999999
the weather today is really nicely

86.759 --> 92.84
changed around

89.4 --> 92.84
it's sunny again

97.38 --> 102.0
Clear Blue Sky

99.14 --> 104.57900000000001
although it's not completely clear it

102.0 --> 108.38
does seem like there has been trailing

104.579 --> 108.38
just looking at the patterns

108.6 --> 114.119
but yeah it's not that bad and

111.18 --> 118.2
it's good to have like a nice Clear Blue

114.119 --> 118.2
Sky day again

120.0 --> 122.84
so yeah

125.04 --> 128.18
it's kind of a nice Sunday

130.419 --> 136.26000000000002
[Music]

132.8 --> 138.8
I have no idea what the temperature is I

136.26 --> 141.959
don't think it's even that bad

138.8 --> 146.28
or it's just the same and with this um

141.959 --> 148.02
it's just it appears to be a lot warmer

146.28 --> 153.08
right anyway

148.02 --> 153.08
Loki Jack russank first in chat PGC net

153.66 --> 157.52
Anna Dover fist

158.76 --> 166.44
see you all it is Sunday the 16th of

162.84 --> 166.44
October 2022

170.099 --> 174.11999999999998
right you've got the same weather over

172.019 --> 175.27
there in England okay

174.12 --> 178.37900000000002
make sense

175.27 --> 178.37900000000002
[Music]

180.54 --> 186.79999999999998
it really does show like how close our

183.239 --> 186.8
countries really are effectively

188.4 --> 193.38
ah

189.959 --> 195.84
12 degrees Celsius that's not a lot

193.38 --> 197.98
[Music]

195.84 --> 200.4
yeah over here it's 18 degrees Celsius

197.98 --> 203.17999999999998
[Music]

200.4 --> 203.18
surprisingly

203.34 --> 205.519
thank you

211.62 --> 216.739
so yeah seems like it's a little cooler

214.92 --> 218.51899999999998
over there then

216.739 --> 220.20000000000002
anyway

218.519 --> 222.92000000000002
are we all doing

220.2 --> 222.92
ah

225.019 --> 233.659
no freaking shoulder issue so yeah make

228.84 --> 233.659
sure that the slept good and all that

238.2 --> 242.51899999999998
I think it might also have something to

240.299 --> 243.959
do that I over ate a little like the day

242.519 --> 246.42000000000002
before

243.959 --> 249.239
it was weird anyway I had a short call

246.42 --> 250.67999999999998
with my dad and apparently he has

249.239 --> 253.739
some kind of

250.68 --> 255.36
like muscle issues too so he's feeling a

253.739 --> 258.12
little stiff so I really called it

255.36 --> 261.23900000000003
yesterday like that is kind of happening

258.12 --> 264.9
to a lot of people and yeah

261.239 --> 267.919
it is anyway hello Elise G

264.9 --> 267.919
good to see you

270.18 --> 272.66
all right

282.6 --> 290.04
right so yeah I'm doing I'm doing great

286.74 --> 293.04
yesterday it was a ball busters and I

290.04 --> 295.86
was on it but I was not Super Active

293.04 --> 298.44
I was kind of tired because kiwi started

295.86 --> 301.74
an hour later than usual and just went

298.44 --> 303.54
on past one at night and I just did not

301.74 --> 307.16
have the energy anymore to really do

303.54 --> 307.16
anything verbally anyway

315.6 --> 319.94
but yeah it was a overall pretty good

317.699 --> 319.94
show

319.979 --> 326.18
and hey my show yesterday I watched the

322.32 --> 326.18
whole thing back it was great

326.22 --> 330.84000000000003
I mean yesterday was a really good show

329.1 --> 332.58000000000004
super fluid

330.84 --> 334.85999999999996
good subjects

332.58 --> 337.639
and also I have noticed something else

334.86 --> 337.639
and that is

341.039 --> 346.44
it's about the interactions and how

343.74 --> 348.36
certain things tend to by accident break

346.44 --> 350.46
me out of the flow of whatever I'm

348.36 --> 352.44
thinking about and I've noticed that

350.46 --> 354.96
well while doing it it's not so

352.44 --> 359.3
problematic but then watching back

354.96 --> 359.29999999999995
There's real moments where it's like um

359.699 --> 364.74
I tend to skip

362.58 --> 366.65999999999997
like I tend to skip because of this

364.74 --> 369.18
because I just want to go back to the

366.66 --> 371.88000000000005
zoned in moments

369.18 --> 373.68
and yeah

371.88 --> 376.5
I'm gonna have to think about that one

373.68 --> 379.02
how to deal with that

376.5 --> 382.919
I need to figure out a system for myself

379.02 --> 384.06
as when I really get into the flow how

382.919 --> 387.24
to

384.06 --> 390.66
not let myself get distracted even from

387.24 --> 392.28000000000003
a benevolent angle of approach from

390.66 --> 396.44
somebody

392.28 --> 400.08
like how do I maintain that depth

396.44 --> 403.56
so that the flow isn't Disturbed it can

400.08 --> 406.8
just continue around that out

403.56 --> 409.08
without just blatantly ignoring somebody

406.8 --> 411.3
or

409.08 --> 413.81899999999996
getting offended by them and defensive

411.3 --> 416.58
in order to shut it off because that's

413.819 --> 419.16
just yeah that's

416.58 --> 420.3
people typically don't even understand

419.16 --> 422.94
that

420.3 --> 426.62
when that happens so anyway

422.94 --> 426.62
watched it back was a great show

428.58 --> 435.38
I've managed to download the complete

431.039 --> 435.38
works of who staff hosts

435.479 --> 440.59999999999997
and I'm I'm listening to it this morning

437.88 --> 440.6
and oh

441.0 --> 443.84
oh my God

448.62 --> 456.199
there's so much

451.68 --> 456.199
so much detail it is unbelievable

456.3 --> 460.94
like

457.44 --> 460.94
hello by the way Adam eiken

468.36 --> 473.099
like also I didn't even realize that

470.639 --> 477.06
some of his songs are like

473.099 --> 479.21999999999997
some of the most famous songs ever

477.06 --> 481.319
In classical music

479.22 --> 483.66
it's like songs that I didn't even

481.319 --> 485.819
realize were his basically that are so

483.66 --> 487.139
famous that they are just one of those

485.819 --> 489.08000000000004
songs

487.139 --> 493.08
and he made him

489.08 --> 493.08
it's incredible

493.38 --> 500.879
and just the feeling for detail and

497.639 --> 503.819
and really his empathic Insight I mean

500.879 --> 506.639
I'm really like puzzled right now as to

503.819 --> 509.28000000000003
what kind of a person he used to be

506.639 --> 512.099
I mean was he like a really sensitive

509.28 --> 514.1999999999999
empath or was he exactly the opposite

512.099 --> 517.0200000000001
was he more like

514.2 --> 520.1400000000001
a benevolent psychopath

517.02 --> 522.18
that was just really insistent on trying

520.14 --> 525.72
to understand feelings and he tried to

522.18 --> 528.4799999999999
test it through music because his music

525.72 --> 531.4200000000001
a lot of the things he does like really

528.48 --> 533.82
provokes feelings so it's almost like

531.42 --> 535.4399999999999
he might have written some of that and

533.82 --> 537.9590000000001
then just like Hey listen to this part

535.44 --> 540.5400000000001
like his assistance like listen to this

537.959 --> 542.459
and then just read their facial

540.54 --> 544.38
expressions read their feelings to try

542.459 --> 546.959
to understand is this

544.38 --> 548.82
hitting is this real I it could have

546.959 --> 551.3389999999999
been either

548.82 --> 552.24
but he must have been one hell of an odd

551.339 --> 553.44
duck that guy

552.24 --> 556.38
[Music]

553.44 --> 558.5400000000001
to be able to produce all this and I

556.38 --> 561.6
have yeah barely even touched upon the

558.54 --> 564.54
preponderance of his work now with God

561.6 --> 566.22
so freaking impressed

564.54 --> 570.26
ah

566.22 --> 570.26
so yeah I'm kind of immersed into that

572.279 --> 578.64
so much of this music is really

575.94 --> 580.74
this it's like

578.64 --> 584.399
he's almost like

580.74 --> 586.8
communicating things sometimes I think

584.399 --> 590.1
where he's just showing through music

586.8 --> 592.38
and not telling it's like oh with some

590.1 --> 596.16
of these songs it really seems like he's

592.38 --> 599.82
seen some serious dark [ __ ] and like

596.16 --> 601.5
like he's been in on secrets that he

599.82 --> 603.24
literally cannot talk about I don't know

601.5 --> 605.1
because it's free mason or something I

603.24 --> 607.5600000000001
wouldn't be surprised maybe it's not I

605.1 --> 608.82
don't really care that much

607.56 --> 611.459
but

608.82 --> 614.339
that he's just trying to tell everybody

611.459 --> 615.66
about the secrets and what that did to

614.339 --> 618.12
him

615.66 --> 621.24
without sharing a word

618.12 --> 623.519
and that's a lot of his music I think

621.24 --> 626.24
and it is

623.519 --> 626.24
just

626.76 --> 632.3389999999999
it's he conjures just this entire

629.58 --> 635.36
virtual world in my mind through music

632.339 --> 635.36
it's incredible

638.48 --> 644.16
foreign it's like one of the most

641.54 --> 646.74
visualization stimulating types of music

644.16 --> 650.519
that I've just ever come across

646.74 --> 652.62
or maybe the most anyway right so I'm

650.519 --> 656.18
just really into

652.62 --> 656.18
Gustav Holst right now

658.26 --> 663.18
and it's so weird to be there right now

661.2 --> 666.019
because I still remember like around

663.18 --> 666.019
when I was

667.62 --> 673.68
between 15 and 19.

672.18 --> 677.04
how

673.68 --> 679.5
think it was the Jesuit guy

677.04 --> 681.48
who was my friend like I thought he was

679.5 --> 684.0
my friend for a long time

681.48 --> 686.88
I really made effort for him like that

684.0 --> 690.8
as a friend even though it was all crazy

686.88 --> 690.8
and he was crazy and I was crazy

690.899 --> 695.579
he was like the only other I think I

693.839 --> 697.44
projected on to him like that it would

695.579 --> 699.899
be possible to have a friend

697.44 --> 703.2790000000001
on that level of thinking because he was

699.899 --> 706.459
extremely he might still be

703.279 --> 710.1
extremely sharp just much more

706.459 --> 712.64
compartmentalized with his punches

710.1 --> 712.64
right

713.04 --> 720.24
but he was he was a fan this probably

717.12 --> 722.04
still is maybe not active off

720.24 --> 725.76
Gustav Holst

722.04 --> 728.519
and he even I heard him out about it

725.76 --> 730.4399999999999
because I was scared of the music I was

728.519 --> 733.44
literally scared at that age and I was

730.44 --> 736.74
like I it almost frightened me that he

733.44 --> 740.7
would just have listened all of that

736.74 --> 742.14
and not like even be shocked emotionally

740.7 --> 744.12
or anything

742.14 --> 745.4399999999999
[Music]

744.12 --> 749.64
of course

745.44 --> 751.32
Jazz guy is actually a psychopath so he

749.64 --> 754.399
just can't feel that

751.32 --> 754.399
did not

754.68 --> 758.42
fully grasp that back then

759.54 --> 763.04
it's getting all pretty heavy

764.59 --> 768.019
[Music]

775.98 --> 780.6800000000001
hello Stevie traveler fiber oats

781.27 --> 784.48
[Music]

790.65 --> 798.629
[Music]

801.0 --> 805.92
right what is also kind of weird is that

803.22 --> 807.839
effectively these songs I think I think

805.92 --> 809.639
most of it sucks but I'm not entirely

807.839 --> 811.8000000000001
sure how this all works

809.639 --> 814.44
but I think that all of his songs might

811.8 --> 816.18
be public domain so I could literally

814.44 --> 818.72
just play them live without any

816.18 --> 818.7199999999999
consequence

819.36 --> 827.82
oh well legal consequence anyway

823.98 --> 830.3000000000001
but yeah I'm not gonna do that not right

827.82 --> 830.3000000000001
now anyway

831.12 --> 834.5
but it's good to keep in mind

836.519 --> 839.24
ah

850.45 --> 853.639
[Music]

854.04 --> 859.74
foreign

856.579 --> 863.3389999999999
that's a good point did you see that the

859.74 --> 864.72
performances well it was from the London

863.339 --> 867.62
Philharmonic

864.72 --> 867.62
Orchestra

868.86 --> 874.22
not entirely sure I think it might be

870.899 --> 874.22
like in the 60s or something

879.0 --> 885.68
I don't know

881.639 --> 885.6800000000001
but good point I'll keep that in mind

886.92 --> 894.4799999999999
that yeah the orchestra performance

889.98 --> 894.48
itself might still be copyrighted

897.64 --> 903.149
[Music]

905.279 --> 912.18
but yeah I still would

907.76 --> 915.959
strongly like to re-emphasize that I

912.18 --> 919.079
think that it's been mostly him

915.959 --> 920.0999999999999
that has formed the foundation of like

919.079 --> 924.06
all

920.1 --> 927.9200000000001
the classical based Movie music like

924.06 --> 927.92
maybe just all of it

928.92 --> 933.7199999999999
and

930.959 --> 937.4399999999999
well like Steven Spielberg

933.72 --> 939.48
and George Lucas they really must like

937.44 --> 942.1990000000001
that guy because

939.48 --> 946.44
most of their most famous movie music

942.199 --> 949.76
like is just readily recognizable in so

946.44 --> 952.1990000000001
many of Gustav host's music

949.76 --> 953.76
like so much of it

952.199 --> 958.62
like

953.76 --> 961.04
like any like Star Wars Indiana Jones

958.62 --> 962.94
uh

961.04 --> 966.7199999999999
[Music]

962.94 --> 970.1990000000001
then of course yeah uh

966.72 --> 973.0790000000001
2001 Space Odyssey

970.199 --> 975.92
which is literally took the song

973.079 --> 975.92
ah

982.019 --> 987.66
ahead of his time dude Yee

985.26 --> 990.54
is the seed

987.66 --> 993.26
he's not just ahead of his time he is

990.54 --> 993.26
the seed

993.36 --> 1001.16
that basically created the entire

996.06 --> 1004.9399999999999
industry of Music influencing in movies

1001.16 --> 1007.519
that's all him like I cannot

1004.94 --> 1009.44
find anybody else that actually was

1007.519 --> 1013.279
focusing on it like he was actually

1009.44 --> 1016.1
focusing on that on figuring out

1013.279 --> 1018.98
the response like with a couple of tones

1016.1 --> 1020.5400000000001
and a small twist to just get this whoa

1018.98 --> 1024.199
effect right

1020.54 --> 1027.079
that's him like all the other composers

1024.199 --> 1030.14
out there are pretty good or a lot of

1027.079 --> 1033.26
them but they don't do that they are

1030.14 --> 1036.199
more occupied with like finding

1033.26 --> 1039.439
a certain Harmony or Melody

1036.199 --> 1042.439
and he's not doing that he's building a

1039.439 --> 1045.679
system he's like a Puzzler and he's just

1042.439 --> 1048.14
building perfectly in lockstep and then

1045.679 --> 1052.4
and through the mechanized synchronicity

1048.14 --> 1057.5590000000002
shows just this unbelievable Magic

1052.4 --> 1060.14
it is like which I think thus far is

1057.559 --> 1062.0
like pinnacleized in the Hammersmith

1060.14 --> 1065.24
but yeah I haven't listened to actually

1062.0 --> 1067.46
all of it so but

1065.24 --> 1070.52
that's just what really stands out to me

1067.46 --> 1074.179
like I can lick I now

1070.52 --> 1076.76
know some of these classical pieces the

1074.179 --> 1080.3600000000001
melody the complex ones I know them by

1076.76 --> 1083.0
heart now very quickly quick work it's

1080.36 --> 1085.82
like it's actually easier to figure it

1083.0 --> 1089.72
out when you isolate them separately

1085.82 --> 1091.9399999999998
than it is to behold and absorb it as a

1089.72 --> 1094.1200000000001
whole which is just surreal in its own

1091.94 --> 1094.1200000000001
way

1096.94 --> 1102.1000000000001
[Music]

1098.6 --> 1102.1
Richard Wagner

1103.34 --> 1109.4399999999998
could also be I mean

1106.039 --> 1112.64
the ultimate influence

1109.44 --> 1112.64
[Music]

1113.24 --> 1118.7
I don't know I would have to like really

1115.4 --> 1123.919
listen to Wagner then and then compare

1118.7 --> 1123.919
it but again Wagner more

1123.98 --> 1131.24
about theme right if you would say MC

1127.46 --> 1134.3600000000001
Banner that Wagner in his themes or

1131.24 --> 1136.34
something influence Star Wars more then

1134.36 --> 1139.4599999999998
I'd say yeah sure

1136.34 --> 1142.6399999999999
but when it comes to the actual

1139.46 --> 1145.7
Movie music Magic

1142.64 --> 1146.7990000000002
that's all Costa Falls listen like

1145.7 --> 1149.8400000000001
everything

1146.799 --> 1154.1
every little thing is you can find

1149.84 --> 1156.32
everything of that back every detail and

1154.1 --> 1158.7199999999998
how it's done how the sound is actually

1156.32 --> 1159.4299999999998
arranged and fall you can all find that

1158.72 --> 1161.539
back

1159.43 --> 1164.72
[Music]

1161.539 --> 1167.539
in Gustav Holst

1164.72 --> 1169.299
so yeah sure Wagner would have been an

1167.539 --> 1174.32
influence but

1169.299 --> 1176.4189999999999
gustavo's influence is just undeniable

1174.32 --> 1180.34
like

1176.419 --> 1180.3400000000001
yeah no doubt in my mind anyway

1182.559 --> 1188.5
professional musicians in the previous

1184.76 --> 1193.48
three generations oh really it was a wow

1188.5 --> 1193.48
fourth generation musician Epic

1199.52 --> 1203.08
all right interesting

1207.74 --> 1213.14
right yeah but this guy was would have

1211.22 --> 1215.3600000000001
had to have been just completely

1213.14 --> 1218.2990000000002
obsessed with his music

1215.36 --> 1219.5
I think I can easily imagine that at the

1218.299 --> 1223.1
time

1219.5 --> 1225.02
when he was like having his like I just

1223.1 --> 1227.6
wrote a new play we're gonna perform it

1225.02 --> 1229.46
and that people would literally just

1227.6 --> 1232.9399999999998
afterward be like

1229.46 --> 1236.96
oh my God what just happened

1232.94 --> 1239.3600000000001
like like almost terrified of how

1236.96 --> 1241.52
impactful it would have been

1239.36 --> 1243.08
to hear all that stuff for the first

1241.52 --> 1245.96
time from people that were just

1243.08 --> 1247.6999999999998
mesmerized by it I bet I think that some

1245.96 --> 1249.98
people might have even thought like that

1247.7 --> 1252.14
guy is the devil

1249.98 --> 1254.78
he's the devil

1252.14 --> 1257.539
and like I wouldn't even blame them for

1254.78 --> 1259.78
saying that because it's just holy [ __ ]

1257.539 --> 1259.78
man

1261.14 --> 1263.679
right

1265.7 --> 1272.539
just the way he he gets to you

1269.059 --> 1274.1
emotionally so quickly and unexpectedly

1272.539 --> 1276.86
anyway

1274.1 --> 1279.62
did you ever considering career immunity

1276.86 --> 1281.84
oh really did I ever consider it I mean

1279.62 --> 1285.559
only both my parents were professional

1281.84 --> 1288.08
musicians and music teachers

1285.559 --> 1290.6789999999999
yeah of course I've considered it

1288.08 --> 1290.6789999999999
but

1295.52 --> 1299.86
I don't have what it takes

1299.9 --> 1302.799
foreign

1305.6 --> 1310.52
yeah

1306.919 --> 1313.64
I'm in I some I'm a fine taster that's

1310.52 --> 1315.32
how I see I got extreme music analytical

1313.64 --> 1317.1200000000001
skills that I inherited from my mother

1315.32 --> 1319.72
but I don't

1317.12 --> 1319.7199999999998
have

1320.179 --> 1325.299
like a drive to create music

1327.559 --> 1335.84
it's like it's too magical to me

1330.919 --> 1338.3600000000001
like I can't do it it's it's if I'm I've

1335.84 --> 1340.3999999999999
like fundamentally on a spiritual level

1338.36 --> 1343.6399999999999
of fear that if I would actually try to

1340.4 --> 1348.1000000000001
do that that it would destroy the magic

1343.64 --> 1348.1000000000001
of actually the music to me

1348.74 --> 1352.24
I've always been afraid of that

1362.24 --> 1365.6
did any play any instruments probably

1364.52 --> 1368.9
not

1365.6 --> 1370.9399999999998
but it's it's yeah it's amazing it

1368.9 --> 1373.46
amazes you well I've seen my mother do

1370.94 --> 1375.26
that my mother composed music and it was

1373.46 --> 1378.2
literally there as she was doing that

1375.26 --> 1380.48
she would only use the piano but the

1378.2 --> 1382.039
thing is you just have to hear it in

1380.48 --> 1383.84
your head

1382.039 --> 1386.299
if you hear it in your head and you can

1383.84 --> 1389.24
keep that Vision consistent then you can

1386.299 --> 1391.58
all ride it out even if that's like 20

1389.24 --> 1394.059
different instruments as long as you can

1391.58 --> 1396.559
actually maintain

1394.059 --> 1399.02
simulating hearing it

1396.559 --> 1400.58
and locking it into your mind with the

1399.02 --> 1404.12
vision

1400.58 --> 1407.1999999999998
just a very musician thing

1404.12 --> 1407.1999999999998
then you can

1410.12 --> 1417.26
like

1412.22 --> 1420.64
I can simulate music great in my mind

1417.26 --> 1420.64
but I don't compose

1422.0 --> 1429.02
what I end up doing with it is

1425.62 --> 1431.6
sometimes if I dare to I get a little

1429.02 --> 1433.46
Jazzy and then I try to find tones in

1431.6 --> 1435.799
between the tones just to see if there's

1433.46 --> 1443.0
something possible there's some hidden

1435.799 --> 1445.76
melodic magic usually it's like 90 off

1443.0 --> 1447.799
but I do find interesting things to

1445.76 --> 1450.08
basically like find the the missing

1447.799 --> 1452.059
party and then just kind of sing along

1450.08 --> 1454.9399999999998
with that I do that a lot especially

1452.059 --> 1458.32
with the electro music by the way

1454.94 --> 1461.24
classic ones I just try to

1458.32 --> 1464.0
synchronize with

1461.24 --> 1465.679
the instruments themselves I don't try

1464.0 --> 1470.299
to play another party and that that's

1465.679 --> 1475.039
just would be absolutely Blasphemous uh

1470.299 --> 1476.72
but yeah I don't I'm a parrot by I

1475.039 --> 1481.1
respond

1476.72 --> 1484.88
I can simulate but I don't know the

1481.1 --> 1487.82
creation of it I don't I dare not

1484.88 --> 1491.9
I just I don't even try to

1487.82 --> 1496.1789999999999
I'm just enjoying it and like simulating

1491.9 --> 1496.179
it and trying to understand it

1499.52 --> 1503.1399999999999
it was kind of weird because

1503.72 --> 1507.44
like I'm so different from my mother in

1506.36 --> 1508.6399999999999
that sense

1507.44 --> 1511.7
that

1508.64 --> 1514.2800000000002
went first like music rearrangement

1511.7 --> 1517.88
starts to pop up like for example in

1514.28 --> 1520.3999999999999
Ballers gate which is classical but it's

1517.88 --> 1523.7
it's yeah

1520.4 --> 1525.98
made in a very peculiar way with

1523.7 --> 1528.679
recognizable things borrowed from all

1525.98 --> 1532.6
over the place including Gustav Holst no

1528.679 --> 1532.6000000000001
doubt absolutely no doubt

1532.88 --> 1538.4
and I was just so amazed that that's

1536.24 --> 1542.059
possible and that you could basically

1538.4 --> 1542.8400000000001
just use music like Lego pieces like

1542.059 --> 1545.96
that

1542.84 --> 1549.1399999999999
and just make beautiful things with it

1545.96 --> 1550.76
but my mother was never really impressed

1549.14 --> 1552.679
with that

1550.76 --> 1555.08
my mother would just feel like yeah

1552.679 --> 1557.9
you're just diluting the original and

1555.08 --> 1561.6789999999999
she would always see it like that and in

1557.9 --> 1564.5
that sense we were already so different

1561.679 --> 1566.659
that I'm very okay with this whole music

1564.5 --> 1568.82
assimilation and

1566.659 --> 1571.8200000000002
the yeah the problem is of course that

1568.82 --> 1574.279
like the mainstream music industry has

1571.82 --> 1576.86
like the the assimilate the assimilation

1574.279 --> 1578.6
have totally overdone that part until

1576.86 --> 1581.539
there's just nothing left and it's just

1578.6 --> 1584.4189999999999
pure garbage now

1581.539 --> 1587.84
I hate that

1584.419 --> 1590.44
but when you try to do it very carefully

1587.84 --> 1595.22
and with respect with really good things

1590.44 --> 1597.0800000000002
then it's absolutely astounding to me

1595.22 --> 1601.4
it's one of the things that I do

1597.08 --> 1604.3999999999999
actually enjoy but it's kind of rare

1601.4 --> 1607.76
sometimes it's just somebody sometimes

1604.4 --> 1610.279
in some game or a movie gets really into

1607.76 --> 1612.08
it they're really focused they got it

1610.279 --> 1613.76
throughout time they have just vision

1612.08 --> 1615.1999999999998
and it's cohesive and then they make it

1613.76 --> 1617.059
and it's amazing

1615.2 --> 1619.52
and a lot of the times it's absolutely

1617.059 --> 1621.08
just none not that they don't have a

1619.52 --> 1623.96
vision you can hear it it's kind of like

1621.08 --> 1625.9399999999998
a standards

1623.96 --> 1629.779
standard [ __ ]

1625.94 --> 1629.779
not really outstanding

1630.26 --> 1634.059
ah

1631.52 --> 1634.059
anyway

1634.82 --> 1641.02
Maybe music that's

1638.24 --> 1641.02
that's hilarious

1642.559 --> 1647.01
yeah yeah who made music create dude

1644.659 --> 1648.7
that was even on the Commodore 64.

1647.01 --> 1652.4
[Music]

1648.7 --> 1656.8400000000001
we had that at one point like Commodore

1652.4 --> 1660.02
64s had like a music keyboard that you

1656.84 --> 1662.299
could Stick Over The Commodore 64. with

1660.02 --> 1665.3799999999999
the program that you would upload on

1662.299 --> 1665.3799999999999
your tape recorder

1667.64 --> 1670.539
that's hilarious

1672.13 --> 1675.249
[Music]

1676.7 --> 1681.3400000000001
sorry not tape recorder cassette deck

1696.679 --> 1703.64
right yeah sorry Casey oh the see the

1699.98 --> 1706.52
main problem with composing music is

1703.64 --> 1710.179
there's just too many options literally

1706.52 --> 1712.4
if you really grasp music then like it's

1710.179 --> 1714.38
too much it's like what the hell are you

1712.4 --> 1718.179
gonna do with it

1714.38 --> 1718.179
is like too many options

1718.279 --> 1722.299
it's like you think of one thing and

1719.96 --> 1724.46
then like oh but but what if I did it

1722.299 --> 1727.84
like this oh that would have also been

1724.46 --> 1730.64
beautiful uh but what about that and

1727.84 --> 1733.12
you just get buried under too many

1730.64 --> 1733.1200000000001
options

1736.58 --> 1740.8999999999999
that's how that all started out when I

1738.86 --> 1743.12
first tried

1740.9 --> 1745.76
I mean I did try at some point I think

1743.12 --> 1749.08
it was like around

1745.76 --> 1749.08
12 or something

1767.419 --> 1772.779
hmm

1768.74 --> 1772.779
hey Gideon's sake yeah sure

1775.1 --> 1781.58
right that but I am undeniably a brass

1778.82 --> 1784.299
and strings fan

1781.58 --> 1784.299
so

1788.07 --> 1796.099
[Music]

1823.179 --> 1828.799
play samples on the Omega yeah yeah they

1826.159 --> 1831.8600000000001
they started that

1828.799 --> 1834.1399999999999
that's right dude the Amiga had so much

1831.86 --> 1837.08
option

1834.14 --> 1840.44
I mean Amiga if it would have actually

1837.08 --> 1843.62
just not crashed like it did

1840.44 --> 1845.72
could have even like outdone Apple

1843.62 --> 1849.32
in my opinion

1845.72 --> 1850.58
which Apple wasn't all that big at that

1849.32 --> 1853.039
time

1850.58 --> 1855.9189999999999
I mean Amiga was just doing better like

1853.039 --> 1858.559
they were technically better and faster

1855.919 --> 1860.6000000000001
and Freer

1858.559 --> 1862.6399999999999
very quickly

1860.6 --> 1866.02
and that might also be the reason why it

1862.64 --> 1866.0200000000002
was nipped in the butt then

1884.299 --> 1887.899
trying different things until you feel

1886.58 --> 1891.02
it's right

1887.899 --> 1892.4599999999998
yeah well tominoid I don't know who Rick

1891.02 --> 1896.779
Rubin is

1892.46 --> 1899.779
Rick Rubin Junior but yeah I mean if

1896.779 --> 1902.36
you're a professional music creator

1899.779 --> 1905.059
you can't always just be trying to

1902.36 --> 1907.1
create the ultimate Masterpiece and then

1905.059 --> 1908.96
yeah doing it that way just like keep

1907.1 --> 1910.82
picking until like oh that sounds right

1908.96 --> 1912.26
I mean it doesn't have to be every

1910.82 --> 1914.0
single second doesn't have to be a

1912.26 --> 1916.58
master PC

1914.0 --> 1918.08
so yeah that's a good way of then

1916.58 --> 1920.6
creating music

1918.08 --> 1922.6999999999998
just like keep trying to fit it until it

1920.6 --> 1925.399
just sounds right yeah if you have to

1922.7 --> 1928.48
keep producing right

1925.399 --> 1928.4799999999998
that makes sense

1929.48 --> 1935.6
I mean in that sense I I can get to that

1933.2 --> 1938.1200000000001
point where I can be a good music picker

1935.6 --> 1940.34
I could pick music

1938.12 --> 1942.4399999999998
and I would prefer to pick music anyway

1940.34 --> 1945.1399999999999
because I'm very

1942.44 --> 1947.059
tight on what I actually like and

1945.14 --> 1950.8990000000001
there's a whole bunch of music that I

1947.059 --> 1953.12
really despise like the majority of it

1950.899 --> 1956.059
and then it's like oh I'm with friends

1953.12 --> 1958.6399999999999
oh they play that music and then my my

1956.059 --> 1960.5
day is ruined because I'm like I don't

1958.64 --> 1962.72
want to be with these friends in that

1960.5 --> 1964.159
[ __ ] music because it sucks

1962.72 --> 1966.679
[Music]

1964.159 --> 1969.22
right but yeah any

1966.679 --> 1972.799
people that I tend to hang around with

1969.22 --> 1975.26
yeah they all knew quickly

1972.799 --> 1978.44
it's like no you're gonna play music

1975.26 --> 1982.179
it's gonna be that music

1978.44 --> 1982.179
or no not music

1984.14 --> 1986.5
anyway

1987.679 --> 1990.94
the last oh God

1996.2 --> 2001.0
oh John Carpenter yeah yeah John that

1998.779 --> 2003.22
submit yeah John carpet is a very

2001.0 --> 2005.62
interesting Movie Maker

2003.22 --> 2010.26
he's made such great films and he did

2005.62 --> 2010.26
like compose his own music didn't he

2010.84 --> 2015.4599999999998
it's lovely with the with the keyboards

2013.179 --> 2017.799
it's so of that time but he did that

2015.46 --> 2019.179
that's all him in his little Studio it's

2017.799 --> 2022.899
amazing

2019.179 --> 2026.3400000000001
and he he just did that he just did it

2022.899 --> 2026.34
John Carpenter guys

2032.019 --> 2037.86
uh

2033.82 --> 2037.86
hey that one guy could see you

2052.899 --> 2059.7599999999998
yeah at least gee that's that's cute

2055.69 --> 2062.02
[Music]

2059.76 --> 2065.26
I uh

2062.02 --> 2067.119
I don't really considered yeah that I

2065.26 --> 2069.159
mean

2067.119 --> 2075.119
it's not much of a comparison you know

2069.159 --> 2075.119
to Gustav Holst you know rap I mean no

2075.46 --> 2080.619
I mean

2077.26 --> 2082.4190000000003
you could compare Miles Davis

2080.619 --> 2085.599
I think Miles Davis probably really

2082.419 --> 2086.919
jealous of gustavoles if he even knew he

2085.599 --> 2088.48
existed

2086.919 --> 2089.7999999999997
uh

2088.48 --> 2094.56
but

2089.8 --> 2094.5600000000004
no rap hip-hop no

2108.099 --> 2112.78
I mean yeah they can be good they can be

2110.68 --> 2114.64
entertaining they can even be creative

2112.78 --> 2117.7000000000003
with words it can yeah there's I've

2114.64 --> 2119.2
heard good rap songs and all that

2117.7 --> 2122.859
right

2119.2 --> 2124.2999999999997
but I don't really categorize that under

2122.859 --> 2128.2799999999997
music

2124.3 --> 2128.28
I categorize it under entertainment

2147.06 --> 2151.72
hmm

2148.96 --> 2155.68
yeah at least G yeah that that link you

2151.72 --> 2158.02
just gave me ended with f a g

2155.68 --> 2160.9199999999996
it's a kind of for

2158.02 --> 2160.92
foreboding

2162.52 --> 2169.33
uh

2165.24 --> 2169.33
[Music]

2170.14 --> 2174.8799999999997
what

2171.82 --> 2177.96
is the favorite genre

2174.88 --> 2177.96
true or what

2182.5 --> 2187.42
oh God I don't understand the context of

2185.68 --> 2189.5789999999997
that word

2187.42 --> 2191.76
I know I've heard it before I don't get

2189.579 --> 2191.76
it

2192.04 --> 2194.64
foreign

2194.7 --> 2198.24
style category

2199.06 --> 2202.7799999999997
okay uh

2207.22 --> 2209.9399999999996
I

2211.66 --> 2216.24
I don't know

2213.64 --> 2216.24
I

2225.82 --> 2231.2400000000002
I mean yeah that's that's an unfair

2228.76 --> 2231.2400000000002
question

2231.46 --> 2237.28
escape the child I mean come on there's

2234.28 --> 2239.02
so many different types and in all these

2237.28 --> 2241.7200000000003
different types there's there's music

2239.02 --> 2244.0
that it just really love

2241.72 --> 2247.54
and that really have their place and

2244.0 --> 2250.9
their effect on me that is good

2247.54 --> 2253.54
but they're completely different from a

2250.9 --> 2256.859
whole other direction of music so it's

2253.54 --> 2256.859
just not a fair question

2257.859 --> 2262.18
there's a whole bunch of sort of music

2259.54 --> 2267.04
that are like classic especially well

2262.18 --> 2269.9199999999996
Gustav Holst style it's like Movie music

2267.04 --> 2271.42
I do actually like good movie music

2269.92 --> 2274.14
right

2271.42 --> 2274.14
uh

2274.18 --> 2280.54
like with brass and strings especially

2277.3 --> 2283.44
those are my favorites and

2280.54 --> 2283.44
let's see

2287.2 --> 2293.859
like by the way also thinks like

2290.02 --> 2297.28
clarinets and type of flutes also I mean

2293.859 --> 2299.619
yeah they're yeah keep forgetting them

2297.28 --> 2302.5
it's just that the brass and the strings

2299.619 --> 2306.2200000000003
you tend to like impress me the most and

2302.5 --> 2310.32
really get to me so I like those uh

2306.22 --> 2310.3199999999997
but let's see

2310.599 --> 2318.4
yeah I do like great electro music

2315.28 --> 2322.0
in even different directions

2318.4 --> 2323.859
like side trance

2322.0 --> 2326.92
drum and bass

2323.859 --> 2330.0989999999997
but they're terrible versions of those

2326.92 --> 2332.26
out there and those the majority of it

2330.099 --> 2334.54
is kind of lame

2332.26 --> 2337.3
but there's just unbelievably great

2334.54 --> 2339.46
songs like one of my favorite music

2337.3 --> 2341.619
makers in the electro scene would be

2339.46 --> 2344.32
mind in a box

2341.619 --> 2346.839
just unparalleled

2344.32 --> 2350.02
this is almost a little bit of a Gustav

2346.839 --> 2352.38
whole stuff Electro I'd say and then

2350.02 --> 2352.38
yeah

2353.2 --> 2358.0
that's not even a completely unfair

2355.9 --> 2359.619
thing to say

2358.0 --> 2361.54
but

2359.619 --> 2363.94
he's good at it

2361.54 --> 2367.8
I mean

2363.94 --> 2367.8
uh and then

2370.48 --> 2373.56
I like good

2374.079 --> 2378.88
folk music too

2376.66 --> 2381.7
in all kinds of directions and that

2378.88 --> 2386.1600000000003
almost becomes classic but in all kinds

2381.7 --> 2386.16
of directions I like good folk music

2387.46 --> 2390.18
so

2397.54 --> 2403.44
yeah

2399.52 --> 2403.44
what check my paper oh okay

2403.839 --> 2406.619
mm-hmm

2412.78 --> 2421.42
right but yeah and dude like jazz

2418.78 --> 2424.0
I don't typically like jazz

2421.42 --> 2427.839
bro Tony Whitcomb

2424.0 --> 2430.32
thank you thank you so much WoW

2427.839 --> 2430.32
damn

2431.92 --> 2438.2200000000003
but yeah I typically don't like jazz

2435.94 --> 2440.5
but some of it

2438.22 --> 2442.72
most of it that I've ever heard that I

2440.5 --> 2446.2
actually like was Miles Davis

2442.72 --> 2448.18
but it's because of the way he does it

2446.2 --> 2450.64
has a system

2448.18 --> 2452.3799999999997
and

2450.64 --> 2454.72
I like that

2452.38 --> 2456.76
I like yeah also because it kind of

2454.72 --> 2460.5989999999997
reminds me of my mother

2456.76 --> 2462.88
but most of it I don't really like

2460.599 --> 2465.88
and especially people that are into that

2462.88 --> 2468.28
kind of tend to annoy me

2465.88 --> 2470.2000000000003
I mean for real

2468.28 --> 2473.2000000000003
uh

2470.2 --> 2473.2
but

2478.839 --> 2483.7
yeah and then to be fair at a certain

2481.599 --> 2485.44
period of my life I was just really into

2483.7 --> 2487.8999999999996
mental

2485.44 --> 2491.8
and there's some really awesome metal

2487.9 --> 2495.64
out there really impressive and yeah and

2491.8 --> 2499.8390000000004
there's also just complete trash

2495.64 --> 2502.3799999999997
complete trash out there as well so

2499.839 --> 2505.839
it yeah now I'm not into metal anymore

2502.38 --> 2508.96
but I I would be a fool to just say oh

2505.839 --> 2511.54
no metal is all trash because

2508.96 --> 2514.42
there's was really good metal and when I

2511.54 --> 2517.0
was into that it was a really

2514.42 --> 2520.359
intense impact on me

2517.0 --> 2523.96
it really gave me a lot of energy

2520.359 --> 2526.7799999999997
so yeah all kinds of music in all

2523.96 --> 2530.14
directions and there's absolute trash of

2526.78 --> 2533.079
of those categories and there's great

2530.14 --> 2536.3199999999997
just gems

2533.079 --> 2539.2200000000003
so I can't just say oh this is my

2536.32 --> 2539.2200000000003
favorite genre

2542.5 --> 2546.119
it's just not doable

2549.54 --> 2553.18
[Music]

2551.5 --> 2556.119
Billie Holiday

2553.18 --> 2558.7799999999997
I know that name but yeah I don't really

2556.119 --> 2558.78
know the music

2574.02 --> 2578.579
foreign by the way

2579.75 --> 2587.88
[Music]

2582.64 --> 2587.8799999999997
so it's already gotten cold boo anyway

2600.34 --> 2603.4990000000003
[Music]

2622.66 --> 2628.48
most of today's music is garbage yeah

2625.74 --> 2632.14
it's Tony Whitcomb

2628.48 --> 2635.26
it's so bad even as garbage

2632.14 --> 2640.319
that I consider public music

2635.26 --> 2642.6400000000003
on average to be more a psychological

2640.319 --> 2645.94
suppression weapon

2642.64 --> 2650.98
that's how I see music out there

2645.94 --> 2653.26
every time I hear music it's crap unless

2650.98 --> 2655.66
it's coming out of my system

2653.26 --> 2656.8590000000004
like there's never like anybody out

2655.66 --> 2659.2
there that's like yeah I'm gonna play

2656.859 --> 2661.54
this song in my car really loud and that

2659.2 --> 2665.0789999999997
it's a really good song I've Just

2661.54 --> 2666.52
that hasn't happened to me in over a

2665.079 --> 2670.6600000000003
decade

2666.52 --> 2672.579
a decade not a single exception where

2670.66 --> 2675.24
somebody would actually be playing a

2672.579 --> 2677.8590000000004
song that I thought that was a good song

2675.24 --> 2680.4599999999996
a decade

2677.859 --> 2680.46
yeah

2683.14 --> 2686.7599999999998
now that's a bad sign

2687.819 --> 2691.8
I don't think just the music has gone

2689.98 --> 2695.92
worse I think that

2691.8 --> 2697.6600000000003
people's taste and grasp on music has

2695.92 --> 2701.44
gotten worse

2697.66 --> 2705.66
the general public has dilapidated in

2701.44 --> 2705.66
their sensibility of dealing with music

2706.72 --> 2713.14
people have let themselves go

2709.599 --> 2715.48
they just play Trash they just it's it's

2713.14 --> 2717.819
come down to like all they need is just

2715.48 --> 2719.859
dingling a bunch of musical keys in

2717.819 --> 2721.839
front of their face now

2719.859 --> 2724.319
that's that's all they need they just

2721.839 --> 2725.98
need some stupid sound

2724.319 --> 2728.02
terrible

2725.98 --> 2730.859
there's no more music out there people

2728.02 --> 2730.859
don't care anymore

2733.36 --> 2739.78
[Music]

2737.079 --> 2742.0
I mean sometimes there's some folk stuff

2739.78 --> 2743.38
going on it's like a Moroccan wedding or

2742.0 --> 2744.599
something and then they play a bunch of

2743.38 --> 2748.6600000000003
drums and

2744.599 --> 2751.599
these these horn thingies

2748.66 --> 2753.7
and that's great I mean then it's

2751.599 --> 2758.04
actually music and it's like yeah that's

2753.7 --> 2758.04
like not bad for a live performance

2758.26 --> 2763.079
but if somebody's just playing music

2761.14 --> 2768.66
through the radio

2763.079 --> 2772.44
or their iTunes or whatever it's just

2768.66 --> 2777.8999999999996
crap not crap

2772.44 --> 2780.52
crap really really disgusting disgusting

2777.9 --> 2784.56
deranged deranged

2780.52 --> 2788.68
ugly equalized deranged spiritually

2784.56 --> 2793.0789999999997
demoralized insane disgusting disgusting

2788.68 --> 2793.0789999999997
people that just ooze they're

2793.72 --> 2800.859
this is what's coming out of speakers

2795.52 --> 2802.78
now it's deranged I hate it it's an

2800.859 --> 2807.4
offense to me

2802.78 --> 2810.28
I find it offensive if I ever get back

2807.4 --> 2812.6800000000003
on some kind of a work floor I'm gonna

2810.28 --> 2815.6400000000003
set demands

2812.68 --> 2818.44
there will be no [ __ ] radio on

2815.64 --> 2821.0789999999997
publicly anybody wants to listen music

2818.44 --> 2823.319
they're gonna have to use headphones or

2821.079 --> 2823.319
whatever

2823.9 --> 2829.2400000000002
or take a break or something

2826.06 --> 2832.18
but I cannot sit through that [ __ ]

2829.24 --> 2835.54
anymore I mean I could work probably

2832.18 --> 2840.04
five three to five times the

2835.54 --> 2842.92
productivity if there was just no music

2840.04 --> 2845.8
and pretty much any sort of job

2842.92 --> 2851.46
I would be five times more productive if

2845.8 --> 2851.46
there was just no [ __ ] music

2851.619 --> 2858.579
because it sucks and people's taste a

2890.8 --> 2893.8
foreign

2894.339 --> 2897.7799999999997
let me give you a test

2910.54 --> 2915.599
if a man

2912.579 --> 2915.599
on a work floor

2915.94 --> 2920.92
never

2918.52 --> 2924.28
touches the radio dial

2920.92 --> 2925.96
and just let's play no matter what comes

2924.28 --> 2928.0600000000004
out

2925.96 --> 2930.96
then they should never be allowed to

2928.06 --> 2930.96
have a radio on

2933.099 --> 2939.819
I think that would fix it

2935.859 --> 2941.68
if they just want noise then they can

2939.819 --> 2943.92
[ __ ] enjoy that noise in their own

2941.68 --> 2943.9199999999996
head

2944.319 --> 2947.4
that would be great

2948.46 --> 2953.68
right if a man still has the impulse of

2951.579 --> 2955.54
like ugh this is a really disgusting

2953.68 --> 2958.48
song I'm Gonna switch now

2955.54 --> 2961.96
then it's okay they'll be allowed to

2958.48 --> 2964.839
have music playing in my opinion

2961.96 --> 2966.76
right if they can actually justify why

2964.839 --> 2969.54
they like a song

2966.76 --> 2969.5400000000004
it's okay

2973.26 --> 2977.8590000000004
otherwise they should just not be

2975.46 --> 2979.96
allowed to have it unless you work on

2977.859 --> 2982.9
your own of course you can put whatever

2979.96 --> 2985.079
noise on you want if you're just on your

2982.9 --> 2985.079
own

2988.0 --> 2993.53
I like the dentist what

2990.39 --> 2993.5299999999997
[Music]

2997.359 --> 3001.7999999999997
what if you had control

2999.76 --> 3003.98
laying someone else didn't like your

3001.8 --> 3003.98
music

3004.02 --> 3009.3
well

3005.7 --> 3011.0989999999997
then you can argue about that

3009.3 --> 3013.1400000000003
right

3011.099 --> 3017.579
and

3013.14 --> 3021.54
yeah I mean if their productivity is

3017.579 --> 3023.7000000000003
like measurably gonna go down then yeah

3021.54 --> 3025.319
well they might wanna yeah you might

3023.7 --> 3027.0
want to turn off the radio then even if

3025.319 --> 3029.2799999999997
you did like that music I mean it's not

3027.0 --> 3033.599
gonna go away

3029.28 --> 3036.0
I mean it's gonna probably send some

3033.599 --> 3038.579
bad feelings between the two

3036.0 --> 3043.099
if that happens

3038.579 --> 3043.099
but I mean yeah what can you do

3044.4 --> 3049.92
you can rearrange how things work on

3046.8 --> 3053.2200000000003
their the work floor you could

3049.92 --> 3055.92
move out of there

3053.22 --> 3057.2999999999997
fire them however the arrangement is you

3055.92 --> 3059.94
know it's just

3057.3 --> 3062.819
a general rule of thumb if somebody just

3059.94 --> 3064.68
has noise on and they don't even really

3062.819 --> 3067.14
listen on what's on there and just

3064.68 --> 3069.0
terrible terrible music comes fast and

3067.14 --> 3071.0989999999997
they don't even notice

3069.0 --> 3073.619
I think those people should just turn

3071.099 --> 3075.8
their radios off and just not turn it on

3073.619 --> 3075.8
again

3085.02 --> 3088.88
what

3087.119 --> 3092.42
oh

3088.88 --> 3092.42
I don't know man

3104.579 --> 3108.54
none of us is right yeah but that was

3106.559 --> 3110.88
not what it was talking about MC banner

3108.54 --> 3113.52
I wasn't talking about whether tastes

3110.88 --> 3118.2200000000003
are different or not

3113.52 --> 3118.22
it's just if you have any taste at all

3118.92 --> 3124.8
yeah because it's just this stupid Force

3122.04 --> 3128.339
habit that people on the work floor want

3124.8 --> 3131.099
some stupid radio on that's garbage and

3128.339 --> 3133.14
it plays garbage and they don't even

3131.099 --> 3135.54
listen to it

3133.14 --> 3138.42
well if I'd have to work there I would

3135.54 --> 3139.2599999999998
be seriously agitated and disturbed by

3138.42 --> 3141.54
that

3139.26 --> 3143.8190000000004
and I would seriously consider asking

3141.54 --> 3145.2599999999998
could you please turn that [ __ ] radio

3143.819 --> 3147.42
off

3145.26 --> 3148.8

3147.42 --> 3152.54

right

3319.079 --> 3322.079
don't drink normally well then you

3321.119 --> 3325.859
should have

3322.079 --> 3328.6400000000003
put a distinct limiter on the amount you

3325.859 --> 3328.64
you can drink

3330.66 --> 3336.0
dude

3333.059 --> 3338.46
I effectively drink every day

3336.0 --> 3340.98
and I have to keep a very distinct

3338.46 --> 3344.04
limiter on how much I drink because if

3340.98 --> 3346.2
even as a daily Drinker if I overstep

3344.04 --> 3347.579
that I'm gonna get sick

3346.2 --> 3350.8999999999996

3350.9 --> 3355.859
you really gotta keep that limiter in

3354.0 --> 3357.18
your mind you got to know how much you

3355.859 --> 3360.5589999999997

4686.0 --> 4691.42
sending me these emails what the [ __ ] is

4689.0 --> 4691.42
the point

4704.84 --> 4711.76
it's a barrier that stops him

4707.659 --> 4711.759999999999
yeah the barrier

4722.12 --> 4725.12
what

4727.28 --> 4730.28

4808.4 --> 4813.0199999999995
okay right I've got it in a window I'll

4811.28 --> 4816.82
check it out

4813.02 --> 4816.820000000001
yeah I can't watch that now

4821.179 --> 4824.62
talking about this video

4835.699 --> 4840.199
more of a truth or in yeah but what does

4838.34 --> 4842.900000000001
that even mean anymore I mean guys

4840.199 --> 4843.95
seriously

4842.9 --> 4845.48
truther

4843.95 --> 4848.239
[Music]

4845.48 --> 4849.98
I mean I'll I'll figure it out as I do

4848.239 --> 4852.28
with everybody but you gotta realize

4849.98 --> 4855.259999999999
that a lot of you guys have basically

4852.28 --> 4857.239
shoved channels and things towards me

4855.26 --> 4859.219
from all all kinds of directions and

4857.239 --> 4861.5
like yeah oh this is really good and

4859.219 --> 4863.96
then no no it isn't

4861.5 --> 4866.12
so I'm really

4863.96 --> 4868.34
reserved

4866.12 --> 4869.78
about getting recommended new channels

4868.34 --> 4872.4800000000005
because

4869.78 --> 4873.92
don't care for their numbers a lot of

4872.48 --> 4876.32
them just suck

4873.92 --> 4879.26
they might be good at what they do but

4876.32 --> 4880.34
that doesn't mean they don't suck

4879.26 --> 4883.76
because

4880.34 --> 4886.76
channels that only ever spend their time

4883.76 --> 4889.3
on just tearing down things

4886.76 --> 4889.3
suck

4890.179 --> 4895.52
those that's just gamma it's like oh

4892.46 --> 4898.04
look at me I'm I'm like a perfect gamma

4895.52 --> 4900.4400000000005
tearing this down like no I don't want

4898.04 --> 4904.54
to watch that I like I don't care

4900.44 --> 4904.54
I don't care about that at all

4905.179 --> 4909.56
about those types of channels so but I

4908.42 --> 4913.4
don't know maybe it's not like that

4909.56 --> 4916.46
you're all praising him so I'll see

4913.4 --> 4921.28
which is being highly skeptical

4916.46 --> 4921.28
but supposed good channels out there

4921.87 --> 4925.0689999999995
[Music]

4926.9 --> 4930.4
our case what

4944.42 --> 4948.9400000000005
a whole lot of banners with his way what

4950.6 --> 4953.320000000001
foreign

4956.78 --> 4962.599999999999
what are you talking about

4960.08 --> 4965.62
what do you mean he gets banned this

4962.6 --> 4965.620000000001
Channel's right there

4974.719 --> 4978.46
what are you talking about Tony with him

4985.64 --> 4989.1990000000005
oh he has this oh okay

5003.159 --> 5005.94
hmm

5010.96 --> 5014.94
I'll check it out

5022.12 --> 5028.12
or didn't get banned then Tony Whitcomb

5025.6 --> 5029.7390000000005
he just got a strike that's not bad

5028.12 --> 5031.54
thanks

5029.739 --> 5033.94
can't link to a channel if they're

5031.54 --> 5037.719
banned

5033.94 --> 5040.36
right but he has his own website

5037.719 --> 5042.04
so he's kind of like a little bit like

5040.36 --> 5044.679
Quantum of conscious who's kind of

5042.04 --> 5048.159
having that same setup yes YouTube

5044.679 --> 5053.46
channel and then he has his own website

5048.159 --> 5053.46
where he posts the more risky videos

5053.679 --> 5056.219
all right

5059.62 --> 5063.719
cool I'll check it out

5095.84 --> 5099.039
[Music]

5104.62 --> 5107.28
what

5107.32 --> 5110.699
what are you doing Canada

5117.58 --> 5121.8
a really ridiculous statement to make

5125.5 --> 5131.76
I won't give you [ __ ]

5128.08 --> 5131.76
fair enough Tony with him

5132.52 --> 5136.780000000001
but the problem is that a lot of time

5134.62 --> 5138.64
people don't think they're giving you

5136.78 --> 5139.84
[ __ ]

5138.64 --> 5143.320000000001
right

5139.84 --> 5145.360000000001
I I mean I know you're not on purpose

5143.32 --> 5147.5199999999995
trying to do that of course don't worry

5145.36 --> 5151.0
about that

5147.52 --> 5154.96
dude you gave me a PayPal I mean

5151.0 --> 5157.659
why would you give me shitty music or

5154.96 --> 5158.7390000000005
channels anyway dude I will check it out

5157.659 --> 5161.11
it's just

5158.739 --> 5164.148999999999
another thing to look into God

5161.11 --> 5164.148999999999
[Music]

5167.739 --> 5175.138999999999
he can't figure oh [ __ ] what what are

5171.76 --> 5175.139
you talking about canavera

5177.46 --> 5182.8
no now he knows the Earth is flat he's

5180.52 --> 5185.7390000000005
just not gonna say it

5182.8 --> 5190.12
because he deals with

5185.739 --> 5193.0599999999995
like pretty deeply immersed people

5190.12 --> 5196.179
like it's a cultural thing like he

5193.06 --> 5198.76
cannot do it if he'll say that

5196.179 --> 5200.92
his entire social life

5198.76 --> 5203.46
will be devastated

5200.92 --> 5208.179
because the people that he deals with

5203.46 --> 5210.659
can never ever assimilate it and he

5208.179 --> 5210.659
needs them

5211.84 --> 5216.82
I mean that must be blatantly obvious by

5214.6 --> 5220.6
now just watch some of the videos where

5216.82 --> 5223.179
he actually is on video you'll see it on

5220.6 --> 5226.360000000001
him literally there the spiritual

5223.179 --> 5228.76
metadata is almost literally dripping

5226.36 --> 5232.36
off it

5228.76 --> 5235.900000000001
he cannot say it's flat he freaking

5232.36 --> 5238.659
knows it's flat you just can't say it

5235.9 --> 5240.28
that's all oh he could say it just to

5238.659 --> 5242.32
demonstrate that he could say but he

5240.28 --> 5246.54
couldn't actually mean it

5242.32 --> 5246.54
that's rather what I'm trying to say

5246.94 --> 5250.96
yeah so he's just not doing it yeah and

5249.159 --> 5253.0
more things

5250.96 --> 5254.8
in this world

5253.0 --> 5257.62
there's more things than just freaking

5254.8 --> 5260.679
Earth being flat

5257.62 --> 5263.739
now if he would be a full-on anti-flat

5260.679 --> 5266.08
earther [ __ ] that's another matter

5263.739 --> 5267.94
I don't think he he wastes his time on

5266.08 --> 5271.36
that and if he did well then he is a

5267.94 --> 5274.9
secret nasty little demon Undercover

5271.36 --> 5278.28
what I don't see any reason why he would

5274.9 --> 5278.28
be like that I mean

5279.58 --> 5284.739
that's

5282.34 --> 5287.1990000000005
yeah that's kind of a big spiritual Bill

5284.739 --> 5291.04
you'd be building up so I don't think he

5287.199 --> 5292.36
does that so what's the point

5291.04 --> 5294.88
the point

5292.36 --> 5296.03
of saying he refuses to say the Earth is

5294.88 --> 5299.22
flat what's the point

5296.03 --> 5299.219999999999
[Music]

5299.62 --> 5305.0199999999995
it doesn't really cure feas Canada yeah

5302.08 --> 5308.1
because Ken is apparently an actual

5305.02 --> 5308.1
anti-flat earther

5311.139 --> 5314.400000000001
and he always was

5316.719 --> 5321.04
which is why so it was so unbelievably

5319.12 --> 5323.679
ridiculous that

5321.04 --> 5325.36
oh Globe Busters is all diving on his

5323.679 --> 5330.12
works

5325.36 --> 5330.12
he is a anti-flat earth glober

5330.2 --> 5333.889999999999
[Music]

5337.69 --> 5341.03
[Music]

5342.699 --> 5346.0
making it hard to be able to come out

5344.5 --> 5349.42
yeah

5346.0 --> 5351.52
yeah but PJ seen it you know why that is

5349.42 --> 5353.88
it's because people can't handle it

5351.52 --> 5358.06
anymore it's because too many

5353.88 --> 5362.08
over-sensitive yet incompetent whining

5358.06 --> 5364.3
little minis out there literally can

5362.08 --> 5367.179
never handle they those people can't

5364.3 --> 5369.400000000001
even handle it if you if you tell them

5367.179 --> 5370.9
that they might be overweight or

5369.4 --> 5373.0
something right

5370.9 --> 5375.759999999999
I mean there's people out there in

5373.0 --> 5378.219
certain cityscapes and it feels to me

5375.76 --> 5380.26
straight on that

5378.219 --> 5382.2390000000005
Matt from Quantum of conscious is

5380.26 --> 5384.280000000001
surrounded by those types of people it

5382.239 --> 5386.739
oozes off him in the spiritual matter

5384.28 --> 5390.04
that it literally comes dripping off him

5386.739 --> 5392.138999999999
I can see it

5390.04 --> 5395.86
he's surrounded by those types of people

5392.139 --> 5398.58
that can't handle anything and I mean

5395.86 --> 5398.58
anything

5403.62 --> 5408.159
so yeah

5405.699 --> 5410.86
how could he ever be expected to just

5408.159 --> 5413.08
like openly come out for Flat Earth you

5410.86 --> 5415.48
gotta be surrounded by Dependable

5413.08 --> 5417.82
reliable dynamic

5415.48 --> 5422.44
viable

5417.82 --> 5425.92
God driven people in order to do that

5422.44 --> 5427.299999999999
if you're not surrounded swarmed by

5425.92 --> 5430.12
those types of people that type of

5427.3 --> 5433.4800000000005
culture it's just not safe

5430.12 --> 5436.0599999999995
to come out with real truths

5433.48 --> 5439.12
that like fundamentally break this this

5436.06 --> 5441.219
the self-created safe spaces to hide

5439.12 --> 5443.5599999999995
from reality because it's too much to

5441.219 --> 5445.719
handle yeah

5443.56 --> 5447.639
can only really come out for Flat Earth

5445.719 --> 5450.82
if you got if you're surrounded by

5447.639 --> 5452.92
people that can simply handle some level

5450.82 --> 5455.259999999999
of Truth

5452.92 --> 5457.7390000000005
and then it's not a problem

5455.26 --> 5460.42
they're all oozing with them

5457.739 --> 5463.659
all locked in their own little ego

5460.42 --> 5466.3
weirdness and they can barely even

5463.659 --> 5470.0199999999995
just handle basic little things without

5466.3 --> 5472.6
going out of control and all that yeah

5470.02 --> 5476.080000000001
you can't tell those people

5472.6 --> 5479.08
such things you might but then

5476.08 --> 5480.76
they will become savonies

5479.08 --> 5483.84
right so

5480.76 --> 5483.84
there's no point

5484.719 --> 5488.62
right if you awaken somebody on a high

5487.6 --> 5491.320000000001
level

5488.62 --> 5493.54
when they're just barely capable of

5491.32 --> 5496.36
managing their own private social

5493.54 --> 5498.699
interactions with other people then

5496.36 --> 5500.62
they're not gonna be able to handle that

5498.699 --> 5502.659
higher level truth and then they're

5500.62 --> 5504.82
gonna more likely end up like a savannah

5502.659 --> 5506.98
just think oh I'm a special boy now

5504.82 --> 5509.5
because I got the special knowledge and

5506.98 --> 5511.839999999999
then go back to basic terrible

5509.5 --> 5514.78
rudimentary Behavior

5511.84 --> 5518.159000000001
like classroom behavior and [ __ ] that's

5514.78 --> 5518.159
what they then will do with it

5520.0 --> 5522.96
it's no point

5528.219 --> 5534.1
if I end up talking about his followers

5531.219 --> 5537.12
talking about the actual people

5534.1 --> 5537.120000000001
around him

5539.86 --> 5544.86
the people in the real world

5542.86 --> 5547.299999999999
right

5544.86 --> 5548.92
and yeah there's a lot of followers

5547.3 --> 5552.219
among his

5548.92 --> 5554.62
that are from another class

5552.219 --> 5557.44
from another other parts of society I

5554.62 --> 5560.739
mean one of conscious is a yeah it might

5557.44 --> 5564.239
surprise you but he actually his net

5560.739 --> 5564.239
is very wide

5566.38 --> 5571.4800000000005
he has

5568.3 --> 5573.52
angles of approach for all category of

5571.48 --> 5574.839999999999
people some of which we literally don't

5573.52 --> 5580.360000000001
care about

5574.84 --> 5582.360000000001
he does because it's part of him

5580.36 --> 5585.699
important

5582.36 --> 5588.28
and yeah he just knows like [ __ ] Flat

5585.699 --> 5590.82
Earth it doesn't [ __ ] matter it just

5588.28 --> 5590.82
doesn't matter

5592.96 --> 5598.0
it's not worth

5594.699 --> 5601.919999999999
just endlessly bickering with people

5598.0 --> 5601.92
that are unwilling to face something

5603.159 --> 5608.759999999999
it's not worth it to him not for what

5605.02 --> 5611.9800000000005
he's trying to accomplish for his study

5608.76 --> 5614.62
right it's for somebody that's basically

5611.98 --> 5616.299999999999
willing to face that potentially the

5614.62 --> 5619.84
rest of their life

5616.3 --> 5621.820000000001
the real flat earthers Nathan Oakley

5619.84 --> 5624.04
like myself like the whole Flat Earth

5621.82 --> 5626.86
debates team

5624.04 --> 5631.0
and other people out there too but yeah

5626.86 --> 5633.159
even non-flat Earth Debaters already

5631.0 --> 5635.679
typically have like this tendency of

5633.159 --> 5638.138999999999
like no find some Middle Road somewhere

5635.679 --> 5640.6
like oh we might not call ourselves Flat

5638.139 --> 5642.76
Earth oh we might not take the

5640.6 --> 5644.679
scientific method that's trick or oh we

5642.76 --> 5646.4800000000005
might take this little part not really

5644.679 --> 5648.88
that strict or that little part yeah

5646.48 --> 5651.78
that happens then that happens a lot out

5648.88 --> 5654.159000000001
there becomes all watered down

5651.78 --> 5655.84
easier so you don't have to fight

5654.159 --> 5657.58
continually you can just kind of

5655.84 --> 5658.900000000001
maneuver around it yeah and then you

5657.58 --> 5662.3
don't have the learning moments which

5658.9 --> 5666.148999999999
was the entire point of it all

5662.3 --> 5666.149
[Music]

5666.82 --> 5671.159
right so it's not for everybody

5675.04 --> 5679.54
and what he's trying to do

5677.56 --> 5682.780000000001
Quantum of conscious is trying to do

5679.54 --> 5685.9
this project is not make everybody

5682.78 --> 5687.94
polarize around the singular subject but

5685.9 --> 5690.879999999999
he's trying to highlight is the

5687.94 --> 5693.419999999999
structure of things that he sees the

5690.88 --> 5697.42
structure everything he does is

5693.42 --> 5700.84
exclusively about structure

5697.42 --> 5703.179
the structure of energy the structure of

5700.84 --> 5703.96
events the structure of things as they

5703.179 --> 5707.08
happen

5703.96 --> 5708.699
structure of energy the structure of

5707.08 --> 5711.42
coincidence the structure of

5708.699 --> 5711.419999999999
synchronicity

5711.639 --> 5716.08
structure of retro causality it's all

5714.34 --> 5718.54
about structure that's what he does

5716.08 --> 5723.34
that's his primary focus that's where

5718.54 --> 5727.98
his art is he doesn't give a [ __ ] about

5723.34 --> 5727.9800000000005
Flat Earth or Globe Earth okay

5728.679 --> 5734.26
is not something to throw his entire

5731.139 --> 5736.659000000001
project to decide for

5734.26 --> 5738.6990000000005
and he's not going to and I don't care

5736.659 --> 5740.679
if he does or doesn't I mean if he's

5738.699 --> 5743.259999999999
going to make really stupid Globe

5740.679 --> 5745.12
remarks to kind of defend away from Flat

5743.26 --> 5747.820000000001
Earth it's just gonna make him look

5745.12 --> 5751.12
[ __ ] and he knows that so it's his

5747.82 --> 5753.159
[ __ ] problem you don't do that then

5751.12 --> 5757.12
there's consequences not through our

5753.159 --> 5758.799999999999
actions but through your actions

5757.12 --> 5762.9
and he knows it

5758.8 --> 5762.900000000001
his choice his project

5763.51 --> 5767.43
[Music]

5768.1 --> 5770.88
ah

5784.78 --> 5787.5
today

5793.54 --> 5796.819
[Music]

5800.1 --> 5814.319
[Music]

5818.639 --> 5824.159000000001
so yeah that's just it's gonna be what

5821.8 --> 5824.159000000001
it is

5824.56 --> 5830.26
I mean in general if somebody's just

5827.62 --> 5831.82
outright saying flat earther I'm a

5830.26 --> 5833.8
flatter

5831.82 --> 5837.84
like on videos or what that's already

5833.8 --> 5837.84
like you should you should

5838.26 --> 5843.6
immediately be suspicious then

5844.84 --> 5850.4800000000005
because there is people out there that

5848.5 --> 5851.739
literally are

5850.48 --> 5854.138999999999
there

5851.739 --> 5856.239
posing as flat earthers to ridicule it

5854.139 --> 5859.179
to wreck it and that's been going on

5856.239 --> 5863.799999999999
since 2015. fake fighter authors coming

5859.179 --> 5866.92
out being extra [ __ ] going on shows

5863.8 --> 5869.860000000001
on science show to just show how [ __ ]

5866.92 --> 5871.96
[ __ ] the flat earther can be yeah

5869.86 --> 5874.0
those are people that officially are

5871.96 --> 5876.219
flat earthers like they constantly say

5874.0 --> 5878.08
that yeah so you should always be

5876.219 --> 5882.04
careful of anybody

5878.08 --> 5884.76
that just overtly says that

5882.04 --> 5884.76
always

5884.8 --> 5889.0
that it doesn't mean that they're always

5886.48 --> 5891.28
going to be posers making it look

5889.0 --> 5892.719
ridiculous because yeah that all depends

5891.28 --> 5895.98
on what they're gonna roll out what

5892.719 --> 5895.9800000000005
you're actually learning from them

5896.679 --> 5900.12
who are the fake ones

5902.26 --> 5907.3
the ones that are not left over the ones

5905.139 --> 5909.28
that we don't even remember their names

5907.3 --> 5913.0
because who gives a [ __ ] what some

5909.28 --> 5914.86
[ __ ] actor [ __ ] out there did that

5913.0 --> 5917.08
literally nobody cares about and they're

5914.86 --> 5919.96
probably debt from the covet vacs Anyway

5917.08 --> 5924.04
by now so who gives a [ __ ]

5919.96 --> 5927.4
right nobody cares who the fake ones are

5924.04 --> 5929.38
the fake ones are the one the ones that

5927.4 --> 5930.82
don't make any sense that don't make any

5929.38 --> 5934.2390000000005
points

5930.82 --> 5936.4
and that are just lame and incompetent

5934.239 --> 5940.199
structurally and they're not learning

5936.4 --> 5940.199
those are the fake ones yeah

5942.52 --> 5947.4400000000005
and then there's people that are just

5945.219 --> 5949.4800000000005
not super eventful and they kind of

5947.44 --> 5950.98
stick to their own platform and they

5949.48 --> 5953.138999999999
hang around with a bunch of guys that's

5950.98 --> 5955.36
a very typical format for a real flat

5953.139 --> 5957.400000000001
earther and some of them might even not

5955.36 --> 5962.259999999999
call themselves flood earther because

5957.4 --> 5964.719
how dare you we're level earthers hmm

5962.26 --> 5968.639
right

5964.719 --> 5968.639
but they're flat earthers

5968.86 --> 5973.96
it just

5971.08 --> 5978.0599999999995
yeah to chicken [ __ ] to actually just

5973.96 --> 5978.06
overtly call themselves flat earthers

5978.159 --> 5982.599999999999
that's all

5980.8 --> 5985.12
but yeah if somebody just calls

5982.6 --> 5988.96
themselves flat earther that does not

5985.12 --> 5991.9
under any circumstance mean that you

5988.96 --> 5995.26
should just immediately trust them

5991.9 --> 5997.599999999999
never do that somebody just you don't

5995.26 --> 5998.860000000001
know and they're saying they're a flat

5997.6 --> 6002.360000000001
earther

5998.86 --> 6005.88
you should not trust them immediately

6002.36 --> 6011.4
like never blindly never just like oh

6005.88 --> 6014.84
one of us I am now your Cog no

6011.4 --> 6014.839999999999
no never do that

6015.78 --> 6020.639
you should only

6018.36 --> 6022.5
yeah you should investigate who is

6020.639 --> 6023.9400000000005
somebody what are they like

6022.5 --> 6026.34
what are they doing what is their

6023.94 --> 6028.138999999999
background what are their issues how

6026.34 --> 6030.4800000000005
honest are they

6028.139 --> 6034.52
how what kind of games do they like to

6030.48 --> 6034.5199999999995
play with people's feelings if any

6034.739 --> 6040.678999999999
yeah

6036.32 --> 6043.799999999999
that's what you need to know in order to

6040.679 --> 6044.88
size up how much you can trust them and

6043.8 --> 6048.3
with what

6044.88 --> 6051.719
you should never unconditionally trust

6048.3 --> 6053.46
anybody that you do not know just

6051.719 --> 6056.159
because they sat there a flat earther

6053.46 --> 6058.7390000000005
you got it

6056.159 --> 6059.5199999999995
this is really important for Outsiders

6058.739 --> 6063.0
too

6059.52 --> 6065.9400000000005
never just trust somebody just because

6063.0 --> 6066.96
they're say they say they're a flat

6065.94 --> 6069.299999999999
earther

6066.96 --> 6071.82
there's some really [ __ ] deranged

6069.3 --> 6073.72
people out there that are flat earthers

6071.82 --> 6075.179
too

6073.72 --> 6077.820000000001
[Music]

6075.179 --> 6080.55
that are like Monsters and they barely

6077.82 --> 6082.98
even recognize that about themselves

6080.55 --> 6085.860000000001
[Music]

6082.98 --> 6087.659
but then again that's not exclusive to

6085.86 --> 6089.94
flatter there's there's a whole bunch of

6087.659 --> 6091.62
very seriously demonically possessed

6089.94 --> 6095.94
deranged people

6091.62 --> 6098.34
the direct the wretches of society

6095.94 --> 6101.159
that manipulate and [ __ ] around and are

6098.34 --> 6102.31
Reckless and

6101.159 --> 6103.619
evil

6102.31 --> 6106.1990000000005
[Music]

6103.619 --> 6107.58
but yeah some flat earthers are like

6106.199 --> 6109.678999999999
that too

6107.58 --> 6111.53
so you gotta know them before you trust

6109.679 --> 6113.639
them very simple

6111.53 --> 6115.8

6115.8 --> 6122.06
Logan Paul's not a flatterer this is

6118.739 --> 6122.0599999999995
just a troll piece of [ __ ]

6124.739 --> 6129.9
the only thing he did is just get in

6127.32 --> 6131.82
there to to troll it like he does with

6129.9 --> 6135.44
everything

6131.82 --> 6135.44
I don't care like

6135.54 --> 6141.0
his name being known is too much credit

6138.9 --> 6142.799999999999
for him

6141.0 --> 6145.38
it would be better if he was just

6142.8 --> 6148.1
completely erased from everybody in the

6145.38 --> 6148.1
world's Minds

6148.28 --> 6154.259999999999
that would be the best solution nobody

6151.56 --> 6156.619000000001
needs to know him or that he existed

that is monstrous

6221.04 --> 6229.32
what the [ __ ] seriously they still they

6224.88 --> 6231.6
actually they actually fully on

6229.32 --> 6233.82
believe that

6231.6 --> 6237.92
or are they just setting up a crazy

6233.82 --> 6237.92
surreal nonsense story to just

6238.08 --> 6242.34
be

6239.82 --> 6245.159
a fake Flat Earth flat I don't know I

6242.34 --> 6247.679
don't know what they're doing man

6245.159 --> 6252.839999999999
really

6247.679 --> 6255.21
they're discussing where space starts

6252.84 --> 6258.409000000001
[ __ ] is wrong with these people man

6255.21 --> 6258.409
[Music]

6261.06 --> 6268.5
strange view of letter yeah also

6265.26 --> 6272.04
like how they never be that stupid

6268.5 --> 6274.38
little space Flat Earth model it never

6272.04 --> 6276.119
even bypassed

6274.38 --> 6279.36
the yeah

6276.119 --> 6281.58
the entropy issue I mean how's the how

6279.36 --> 6285.0
the hell's that gas staying on that Flat

6281.58 --> 6288.179
Earth as it's flying through space

6285.0 --> 6290.52
how the [ __ ] is that supposed to work I

6288.179 --> 6293.3
mean that makes thing even more sloppy

6290.52 --> 6293.3
than the globe model

6310.98 --> 6317.36
it's just so don't arranged man it's so

6314.34 --> 6317.360000000001
deranged I mean

6318.36 --> 6325.219

6322.32 --> 6325.219
don't understand

no

6384.119 --> 6388.679
it's very simple

6386.4 --> 6392.94
yeah Dell might have said that but it's

6388.679 --> 6394.139
just not true we are not accelerating up

6392.94 --> 6397.138999999999
foreign

6394.139 --> 6397.139
possible

6399.48 --> 6404.58
I mean

6400.92 --> 6407.6990000000005
it's logically impossible

6404.58 --> 6411.8
it's like mathematically impossible

6407.699 --> 6415.5599999999995
you mean because acceleration means ever

6411.8 --> 6419.34
increasing speed it's not just a speed

6415.56 --> 6419.34
it is accelerating

6419.48 --> 6424.799999999999
forever

6421.26 --> 6427.56
that is logically impossible let alone

6424.8 --> 6432.2390000000005
physically impossible right it's

6427.56 --> 6435.6
logically impossible like that cannot be

6432.239 --> 6437.099999999999
you just can't it just okay

6435.6 --> 6439.02
so

6437.1 --> 6441.4800000000005
it's just no

6439.02 --> 6443.820000000001
right the whole stupid thing about

6441.48 --> 6446.4
accelerating upward it was nothing but a

6443.82 --> 6448.04
dumb mind experiment

6446.4 --> 6452.46
to basically

6448.04 --> 6456.36
simulate what Newtonian gravity

6452.46 --> 6459.06
like how that would happen like that is

6456.36 --> 6463.08
it it was just one stupid little mind

6459.06 --> 6465.6
experiment and that's it

6463.08 --> 6466.98
it doesn't mean that that's literally

6465.6 --> 6470.1
real

6466.98 --> 6473.28
it was just a what if

6470.1 --> 6474.719
test right what if yeah if it was

6473.28 --> 6477.599999999999
accelerating up oh yeah there's just

6474.719 --> 6479.94
like there's a force there that's it

6477.6 --> 6482.280000000001
nothing about that was literal or even

6479.94 --> 6485.339999999999
meant literal

6482.28 --> 6487.259999999999
and it's just a mockery of people's

6485.34 --> 6489.6
intelligence that they're even going

6487.26 --> 6494.3
with that now

6489.6 --> 6494.3
and yeah but the flatter Society this is

6495.06 --> 6498.26
it's exhausting

6509.6 --> 6513.679
they don't claim that anymore

6516.659 --> 6519.379999999999
okay

6524.159 --> 6527.759999999999
well

6525.179 --> 6530.28
why are they still even active I mean

6527.76 --> 6534.84
why don't they just disband already

6530.28 --> 6536.94
just this band leave it you suck you

6534.84 --> 6538.92
suck at speculation you suck at mind

6536.94 --> 6541.138999999999
experimentation you suck at everything

6538.92 --> 6543.42
you do

6541.139 --> 6546.84
it's totally pointless nothing about

6543.42 --> 6549.6
your model is has any point nothing

6546.84 --> 6552.06
about it it's all pointless flatter

6549.6 --> 6554.6990000000005
Society model is completely pointless

6552.06 --> 6558.0
it's a waste of everybody's time

6554.699 --> 6560.839999999999
they don't even learn anything there you

6558.0 --> 6560.84
don't learn anything

6561.239 --> 6565.678999999999
what are you learning visiting the

6563.58 --> 6567.42
flatter Society

6565.679 --> 6569.34
what do you learn nothing are you

6567.42 --> 6571.1990000000005
learning anything about physics no

6569.34 --> 6573.84
relating you're learning anything about

6571.199 --> 6577.138999999999
cartography no you're letting anything

6573.84 --> 6579.0
about navigation no

6577.139 --> 6580.619
what do you learn about

6579.0 --> 6583.02
nothing

6580.619 --> 6585.74
totally nothing

6583.02 --> 6596.02
what a waste of time

6585.74 --> 6596.0199999999995
[Music]

6598.83 --> 6603.179
[Music]

6600.56 --> 6606.56
right yeah now of course we just seen it

6603.179 --> 6606.56
just testing it out for yourself

6633.78 --> 6636.78
foreign

6641.82 --> 6644.0
foreign

6644.94 --> 6648.879999999999
[Music]

6669.679 --> 6674.82
yeah but uh

6672.42 --> 6677.119
nothing really you can do to stop that

6674.82 --> 6677.119
anyway

6679.98 --> 6683.82
right they're always going to outnumber

6681.78 --> 6686.58
us and then just suck

6683.82 --> 6689.219
right so the only way to navigate

6686.58 --> 6692.4
anything on this in this world right now

6689.219 --> 6695.179
on the Internet is you have to know what

6692.4 --> 6695.179
you're looking for

6697.02 --> 6702.619000000001
more specifically who we are looking for

6699.54 --> 6702.619
and then through them

6703.08 --> 6708.3
you can find a good place with good

6705.84 --> 6711.719
information it's very hard to find and

6708.3 --> 6714.54
not a lot of people are good judges

6711.719 --> 6717.659
so it's really difficult

6714.54 --> 6719.639
to find like to basically even find

6717.659 --> 6722.099999999999
somebody that could tell you like yeah

6719.639 --> 6724.92
that guy is what you need that guy's

6722.1 --> 6727.320000000001
what you need to avoid

6724.92 --> 6730.7390000000005
and that's a waste of time right

6727.32 --> 6735.08
just to be able to like perfectly to a

6730.739 --> 6735.08
person point that out is almost

6736.639 --> 6743.76
it is very difficult for a lot of people

6741.36 --> 6746.46
they kind of just need to let it happen

6743.76 --> 6748.320000000001
and then after a while they can figure

6746.46 --> 6750.4800000000005
out like what it was worth that's how

6748.32 --> 6754.44
most people navigate

6750.48 --> 6756.959999999999
they just like oh let it stream over you

6754.44 --> 6759.419999999999
and then after a while it's like huh

6756.96 --> 6763.679
okay

6759.42 --> 6765.06
well I do that very quickly as in in one

6763.679 --> 6766.9800000000005
second

6765.06 --> 6771.56
I can do all that

6766.98 --> 6771.5599999999995
some people it takes years

6771.719 --> 6774.84
years

6773.1 --> 6778.26
for them

6774.84 --> 6780.2390000000005
and then they're all stuck to their

6778.26 --> 6784.02
thing also right so I have to combat

6780.239 --> 6785.879999999999
that on top of it on their habits

6784.02 --> 6789.0
once they figure out that somebody's

6785.88 --> 6792.0
actually kind of shitty for them

6789.0 --> 6795.86
so but I'm very quick with that hey

6792.0 --> 6795.86
Colts free screen see you

6797.88 --> 6802.86
but that's important you need to know

6800.82 --> 6805.259999999999
what the good sources are and how to

6802.86 --> 6809.239
find them and you need to realize

6805.26 --> 6812.219
if you're gonna expect some idyllic

6809.239 --> 6814.739
situation in the end where we will be

6812.219 --> 6818.04
recognized for what we're really doing

6814.739 --> 6819.799999999999
and we won't be covered up by the Beast

6818.04 --> 6822.96
system yeah

6819.8 --> 6826.5
Dream On

6822.96 --> 6828.78
it's not gonna happen ever

6826.5 --> 6830.699
I don't believe it like even if there is

6828.78 --> 6832.86
a great reset in a world war then after

6830.699 --> 6835.4
it's still gonna be like this it's not

6832.86 --> 6835.4
gonna change

6835.94 --> 6839.219
[Music]

6837.84 --> 6843.179
right

6839.219 --> 6845.52
so people no matter

6843.179 --> 6847.5
who they are where they are

6845.52 --> 6849.780000000001
they will have to figure it out

6847.5 --> 6852.3
themselves that they are basically being

6849.78 --> 6854.04
gate kept by a giant wall of [ __ ]

6852.3 --> 6858.659000000001
surrounding them and they have to dig

6854.04 --> 6861.0
through it to actually find a way out

6858.659 --> 6864.659
to find

6861.0 --> 6866.4
more reliable pure sources they have to

6864.659 --> 6870.299999999999
go through the wall of [ __ ] and in the

6866.4 --> 6873.42
wall of [ __ ] there will be a fake it's

6870.3 --> 6875.34
like showing you the entire world in

6873.42 --> 6877.08
that wall of [ __ ] that surrounds you so

6875.34 --> 6878.76
there's going to be a flat Earth in

6877.08 --> 6881.159
there and it's going to be or whatever

6878.76 --> 6882.3
the politics everything is going to be

6881.159 --> 6885.599999999999
in there

6882.3 --> 6886.820000000001
but the real people are not like the

6885.6 --> 6890.58
good parts

6886.82 --> 6893.82
within those groups are not show

6890.58 --> 6894.6
you they only show you the [ __ ] the [ __ ]

6893.82 --> 6897.48
wall

6894.6 --> 6899.88
only the worst parts of it so that

6897.48 --> 6903.0599999999995
you're discouraged as actually trying to

6899.88 --> 6905.34
find a Pure Source so that is what you

6903.06 --> 6907.139
must do if you are completely Outsider

6905.34 --> 6908.159000000001
and you're not following me for years

6907.139 --> 6910.619
right

6908.159 --> 6914.099999999999
you never even heard of Flat Earth

6910.619 --> 6917.04
if you do not on your own choice start

6914.1 --> 6920.04
to dig through the [ __ ]

6917.04 --> 6921.3
to find the real Source the Pure Source

6920.04 --> 6923.88
behind it

6921.3 --> 6925.860000000001
then you will never be informed and you

6923.88 --> 6927.78
will always be surrounded by that wall

6925.86 --> 6929.699
of [ __ ]

6927.78 --> 6932.099999999999
and that's how you will see the world

6929.699 --> 6936.379999999999
and you will not see that there is still

6932.1 --> 6936.38
Beauty and Purity behind it

6937.219 --> 6943.02
right so keep that in mind

6941.159 --> 6945.138999999999
right and I'm going to round out the

6943.02 --> 6945.139
show

6945.48 --> 6949.138999999999

oversaturated with music perhaps

6958.02 --> 6962.1
caught created a couple of Silent pauses

6960.54 --> 6964.4
but yeah now I also have a lot of

6962.1 --> 6964.400000000001
