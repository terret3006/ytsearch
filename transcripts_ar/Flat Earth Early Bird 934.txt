109.68 --> 112.64
whether today

114.96 --> 121.399
very similar to yesterday

118.079 --> 121.39899999999999
although less wind

122.64 --> 127.74
it's just all clouded

125.399 --> 130.319
just

127.74 --> 133.5
not throughout completely not through

130.319 --> 137.099
and through there's still some blue

133.5 --> 138.72
bits shining through but it's barely uh

137.099 --> 141.98
there isn't any rain there hasn't been

138.72 --> 141.98
any rain yesterday either

143.64 --> 149.23899999999998
foreign

145.2 --> 149.23899999999998
but yeah not much sun either

149.94 --> 154.04
it's still kind of nice and warm though

155.519 --> 159.26000000000002
but yeah nothing like a week ago

162.239 --> 164.78
all right

165.42 --> 167.78
so

168.599 --> 176.35999999999999
it's Thursday the 24th

172.2 --> 176.35999999999999
of June 2021

182.06 --> 189.12
uh no we didn't check just yet

185.4 --> 192.06
all right so yesterday's debate

189.12 --> 194.87900000000002
it's very amusing

192.06 --> 198.84
two Ballers on there even

194.879 --> 201.01899999999998
Hey where's that first in chat hello

198.84 --> 201.019
hello

201.659 --> 207.379
also watched back this show

204.42 --> 207.379
after that

207.54 --> 216.18
just to see how well it held up

212.099 --> 218.22
and yeah I thought I was I did great

216.18 --> 221.12
I thought it was indeed very amusing

218.22 --> 221.12
watching it back

230.819 --> 237.659
why oh

233.34 --> 240.36
well Grandpa Joe you see Nathan

237.659 --> 241.56
is very capable of having a productive

240.36 --> 245.22000000000003
debate

241.56 --> 247.2
problem is though that his guests

245.22 --> 250.08
as you say it

247.2 --> 251.76
they're not so much capable of having a

250.08 --> 255.65900000000002
productive debate

251.76 --> 258.419
so when they start engaging in very

255.659 --> 261.59999999999997
silly straw man arguments and red

258.419 --> 264.479
herrings and yeah then

261.6 --> 266.759
then Nathan starts to yell and curse at

264.479 --> 270.06
them for their stupidity and their

266.759 --> 272.46000000000004
fallacy and their inability to recognize

270.06 --> 277.8
what they're doing wrong

272.46 --> 280.979
uh yeah so that's why right

277.8 --> 282.84000000000003
no it all depends on the the guests he

280.979 --> 284.58
has on whether there will be a

282.84 --> 288.0
productive debate or not

284.58 --> 289.32
me my Baldwin character as it's become

288.0 --> 292.08
known now

289.32 --> 295.199
I'm on there regularly and he doesn't

292.08 --> 297.96
yell at me even though I I do get a

295.199 --> 301.68
little bit baller-ish even it's kind of

297.96 --> 305.15999999999997
like a side effect it's part of of it

301.68 --> 308.039
right because as a baller when I act

305.16 --> 312.47900000000004
like that I do back down I do admit

308.039 --> 314.699
mistakes and I just try to well bypass

312.479 --> 317.09999999999997
those mistakes a little bit more

314.699 --> 319.5
cleverly

317.1 --> 324.6
right a little bit with more Elegance

319.5 --> 327.62
instead of just uh you're you're stupid

324.6 --> 327.62
I don't do that

328.86 --> 334.86
because that that type of behavior is

331.919 --> 336.9
really what gets Nathan into his angry

334.86 --> 339.74
mode

336.9 --> 339.73999999999995
uh

341.3 --> 346.56
I have had some smart comedic moments on

344.34 --> 348.85999999999996
every day lately yeah it seems so rest

346.56 --> 348.86
that

351.24 --> 353.84000000000003
uh

354.259 --> 357.91900000000004
I do my best

363.66 --> 368.0
on the tension

365.819 --> 368.0
foreign

369.9 --> 374.69899999999996
I

371.36 --> 376.139
mean he's a complete buffoon really

374.699 --> 380.52000000000004
but

376.139 --> 383.66
I just miss him getting on FTD in a way

380.52 --> 383.65999999999997
he is a lightning rod

383.699 --> 389.36
and either draws in more globers to get

387.18 --> 389.36
on

389.699 --> 396.3
or maybe take some of the tension of

393.06 --> 399.9
those that would come on

396.3 --> 400.979
so they wouldn't be so much like him I

399.9 --> 403.56
don't know

400.979 --> 405.24
or or it'll just make it worse I don't

403.56 --> 408.539
know but still I always think it's

405.24 --> 410.819
hilarious when rumpus comes on

408.539 --> 413.4
like I've never been bored with him

410.819 --> 415.8
coming on like even when he's trying to

413.4 --> 418.08
be boring

415.8 --> 419.94
by laying like not presenting the

418.08 --> 421.38
evidence and then trying to lay down a

419.94 --> 423.18
story that doesn't even have anything

421.38 --> 424.8
directly to do with it for 10 minutes

423.18 --> 427.139
straight

424.8 --> 430.8
you know that sort of thing

427.139 --> 433.139
but I I've always found him amusing

430.8 --> 436.639
I find him less amusing though when he's

433.139 --> 436.639
surrounded by other ballers

439.08 --> 443.35999999999996
then it just kind of becomes boring

444.72 --> 452.36
your chat put input is showing yeah it

449.099 --> 452.36
is I can see you

460.979 --> 464.15999999999997
it's right there it's right there on

462.96 --> 468.02
screen

464.16 --> 468.02000000000004
it's right there so

469.44 --> 474.08
uh wait it's the other way that way

484.8 --> 489.84000000000003
so yeah I hope I answered that question

487.319 --> 492.84000000000003
Grandpa Joe

489.84 --> 496.63899999999995
if it was a question

492.84 --> 496.63899999999995
you didn't have question mark in there

502.56 --> 504.74
foreign

527.519 --> 530.519
also

531.24 --> 536.399
yeah a few days ago I watched the movie

533.459 --> 539.42
I didn't really talk about it then

536.399 --> 539.42
two days ago

539.82 --> 545.24
can it was

541.88 --> 545.24
recommended to me

545.399 --> 552.839
and yeah that movie is really

550.32 --> 555.24
really interesting

552.839 --> 559.1400000000001
and it was weird because when I started

555.24 --> 561.6
to watch it I was like what is this

559.14 --> 564.3199999999999
it's a little more action [ __ ] right

561.6 --> 564.32
it's like oh

565.14 --> 569.6999999999999
like

566.519 --> 571.74
when first you enter the plot of the

569.7 --> 574.62
story it just immediately got the film

571.74 --> 578.399
the movie the sense that oh this is just

574.62 --> 580.8
going to be another action terrorist

578.399 --> 582.66
versus Swati movie or something right

580.8 --> 584.279
because that's kind of like in the

582.66 --> 585.54
middle of what you're getting so I

584.279 --> 588.48
thought like uh

585.54 --> 590.9399999999999
action movie whatever

588.48 --> 594.0
holy [ __ ]

590.94 --> 596.0
is there some really weird science

594.0 --> 599.82
fiction things in here

596.0 --> 603.42
and they really really made it into an

599.82 --> 605.88
art so the movie really gets interesting

603.42 --> 609.06
past halfway

605.88 --> 611.9399999999999
because that's when the real [ __ ] starts

609.06 --> 613.68
to happen and you start to see what the

611.94 --> 616.9200000000001
hell is going on

613.68 --> 618.66
and I've been fascinated by those scenes

616.92 --> 621.18
so I watched them back yesterday

618.66 --> 624.3
separately just

621.18 --> 626.16
how they chiseled it in like that that

624.3 --> 627.779
was very fascinating yeah because it is

626.16 --> 630.66
like

627.779 --> 632.82
it's very weird it's

630.66 --> 634.62
it's a bit sloppy in its mechanic

632.82 --> 637.8000000000001
sometimes and the whole premise is

634.62 --> 640.019
completely ridiculous but yeah it's it's

637.8 --> 642.26
a real attempt

640.019 --> 646.32
to make like a two

642.26 --> 648.18
Dimensions world where one literally

646.32 --> 650.82
runs in reverse

648.18 --> 656.06
or yeah

650.82 --> 656.0600000000001
and they put in a lot of work

656.94 --> 663.24
to kind of like chisel events like

659.88 --> 667.14
forward and then backwards through that

663.24 --> 669.0
right and as it plays out you're already

667.14 --> 671.22
seeing like oh [ __ ] there's some really

669.0 --> 673.44
weird reversed World [ __ ] happening here

671.22 --> 676.14
like it's not even psychologically

673.44 --> 678.12
reversible it's literally time reversed

676.14 --> 680.779
world

678.12 --> 683.94
and

680.779 --> 687.06
then you get to see it from the other

683.94 --> 689.0400000000001
perspective basically the same scene

687.06 --> 693.0189999999999
playing out

689.04 --> 693.019
from the Reversed World it

694.32 --> 701.0400000000001
now as an entire story it's kind of

696.899 --> 704.04
ridiculous but just as a an art piece I

701.04 --> 707.64
thought that was absolutely astounding

704.04 --> 710.16
I've been really impressed by it also

707.64 --> 712.86
I think that overall that the acting is

710.16 --> 714.779
pretty decent in a movie as well

712.86 --> 716.399
although it's it's kind of a little bit

714.779 --> 720.86
stoic anyways

716.399 --> 720.86
but it's very soothing anyway

721.74 --> 725.639
YouTube keeps blocking the word balls

724.44 --> 727.5
really

725.639 --> 730.94
okay

727.5 --> 730.94
oh I can see it right there

731.639 --> 736.399
uh hey Tom Parker good to see you

736.68 --> 739.9399999999999
and seeking star water

754.44 --> 758.9590000000001
hello tiny tiny Womble

766.68 --> 769.3389999999999
all right

773.88 --> 778.86
huh really they're basic they're

776.16 --> 781.399
blocking based on context

778.86 --> 781.399
okay

782.94 --> 785.899
that's annoying

826.019 --> 834.139
okay right uh dude you can test that if

830.16 --> 834.139
Google actually does that I don't know

836.04 --> 843.62
I know they like they don't like it when

839.279 --> 843.62
you fully write down the word [ __ ]

843.72 --> 847.94
they've been blocking that word for a

845.76 --> 847.9399999999999
while

854.699 --> 857.959
hey good servant

862.5 --> 865.04
ah

885.3 --> 889.8599999999999
sounds like YouTube tried to block

887.579 --> 891.18
offensive trolls or if they're trying

889.86 --> 893.94
that

891.18 --> 897.019
sanker Tom then they literally don't

893.94 --> 897.019
know what the hell they're doing

907.32 --> 911.779
oh wow okay rest ahead

912.839 --> 916.8800000000001
if yeah dude if you say so

917.279 --> 922.76
maybe they're now blocking that specific

919.56 --> 922.76
sentence for some reason

930.12 --> 937.399
not tiny one but I don't think uh the

933.36 --> 937.399
chat format has anything to do with that

939.66 --> 944.18
that's just what everybody gets to see

945.3 --> 950.18
if you're whether you are in live chat

947.88 --> 954.6
or top chat doesn't

950.18 --> 955.92
yeah that doesn't initiate a filter for

954.6 --> 958.019
words

955.92 --> 960.9799999999999
it's just for everybody that's going to

958.019 --> 960.98
be seeing it

965.04 --> 971.8389999999999
huh you tasted rum balls left

968.88 --> 971.8389999999999
ah

980.1 --> 985.1990000000001
right because this is exactly what

982.56 --> 987.1199999999999
happens this is why word censorship is

985.199 --> 989.88
completely useless

987.12 --> 992.1
people will just

989.88 --> 994.259
start playing around with it like like

992.1 --> 996.36
kids that are being told like oh you

994.259 --> 998.6990000000001
shouldn't be using this word

996.36 --> 1000.86
like young pre-teen kids

998.699 --> 1003.56
guess what's gonna happen

1000.86 --> 1005.839
they're gonna have a field day trying to

1003.56 --> 1008.42
figure out in how they can apply that

1005.839 --> 1009.98
word that's what's always going to

1008.42 --> 1012.459
happen

1009.98 --> 1012.4590000000001
right

1018.399 --> 1025.24
a D-Back one hey hello Pocono good to

1022.94 --> 1025.24
see you

1028.17 --> 1031.269
[Music]

1035.78 --> 1041.539
right and by the way yeah that response

1038.78 --> 1043.819
is not exclusive to pre-teens

1041.539 --> 1046.9
as you can see

1043.819 --> 1046.8999999999999
men and women

1047.0 --> 1054.02
in between 20 and 60 or whatever that

1051.26 --> 1057.039
the age range is here they do it too

1054.02 --> 1057.039
right now

1059.36 --> 1064.539
sorry you're late hey don't worry about

1061.16 --> 1064.539
it this is not late

1065.6 --> 1071.6599999999999
late would be if you came in the last 10

1069.08 --> 1075.29
minutes that's late but there's still

1071.66 --> 1078.39
another hour and 40 minutes to go

1075.29 --> 1078.3899999999999
[Music]

1078.44 --> 1083.78
so welcome to the chat

1081.5 --> 1086.12
I hope to be receiving some good

1083.78 --> 1087.74
questions so we kind of can move on from

1086.12 --> 1092.299
this silly

1087.74 --> 1094.94
subject of the censorship of balls

1092.299 --> 1099.16
in chat

1094.94 --> 1099.16
when placed in a specific context

1120.98 --> 1127.28
yes rest hat we know

1123.44 --> 1129.4
we know that's what you tried to ask

1127.28 --> 1129.3999999999999
all right

1139.34 --> 1144.34
what do you know about shedding from the

1141.98 --> 1144.34
Jab

1144.919 --> 1147.7
uh

1148.1 --> 1154.539
well what I know about it is that people

1150.74 --> 1154.539
don't really know what it means

1160.4 --> 1165.74
right

1162.32 --> 1169.28
people don't know what it means

1165.74 --> 1171.679
when it's said that vaccines causes

1169.28 --> 1172.76
people to shed like what are they

1171.679 --> 1175.52
shedding

1172.76 --> 1178.4
are they shedding the virus

1175.52 --> 1182.48
that with the shedding

1178.4 --> 1185.72
they shedding Spike proteins

1182.48 --> 1188.299
what does that mean

1185.72 --> 1191.66
does that mean oh the spike proteins or

1188.299 --> 1193.28
the virus is moving out of your body it

1191.66 --> 1195.76
can get on somebody else so what's that

1193.28 --> 1195.76
gonna do

1196.64 --> 1199.2990000000002
nothing

1202.52 --> 1209.84
right look you might have some weird

1207.44 --> 1212.3600000000001
interactions

1209.84 --> 1215.36
like if it maybe in certain

1212.36 --> 1217.6999999999998
circumstances Spike proteins can rub off

1215.36 --> 1219.3799999999999
let's say during sex or whatever you

1217.7 --> 1221.78
know

1219.38 --> 1225.2600000000002
and then yeah it might get into your

1221.78 --> 1227.8999999999999
system and do [ __ ] does that mean like

1225.26 --> 1229.64
it's the same as you never took a

1227.9 --> 1231.38
vaccine you have sex with somebody with

1229.64 --> 1234.6200000000001
a vaccine instantly it's like you've

1231.38 --> 1236.5390000000002
taken a vaccine that seems extremely

1234.62 --> 1239.6589999999999
unlikely to me

1236.539 --> 1242.179
because the process to get your body to

1239.659 --> 1243.74
become the spike protein produced

1242.179 --> 1245.9
producers

1243.74 --> 1250.22
you literally have to inject yourself

1245.9 --> 1254.179
with all that bizarre chemical [ __ ]

1250.22 --> 1256.94
in order to do that right so when you're

1254.179 --> 1260.3600000000001
shedding right shedding it's coming off

1256.94 --> 1262.94
you and it's just the spike protein

1260.36 --> 1264.9799999999998
how is that gonna seed itself in the

1262.94 --> 1267.44
other person's

1264.98 --> 1268.88
genes like that how's it going to do

1267.44 --> 1271.94
that

1268.88 --> 1274.5800000000002
without the chemicals to accompany them

1271.94 --> 1276.3200000000002
how is that going to work right I'm not

1274.58 --> 1278.4189999999999
saying there is no side effects

1276.32 --> 1280.6399999999999
whatsoever yeah you could have all kinds

1278.419 --> 1284.419
of weird side effects

1280.64 --> 1286.94
maybe the shedding can even like cause

1284.419 --> 1289.5200000000002
miscarriages to happen with a woman

1286.94 --> 1293.179
that's not vaccinated right I'm not

1289.52 --> 1295.1
excluding that there might be effects

1293.179 --> 1299.1200000000001
but it's not like you're getting

1295.1 --> 1303.62
infected and now you get it as well

1299.12 --> 1306.4399999999998
that seems impossible to me

1303.62 --> 1308.84
by every model whether you believe it's

1306.44 --> 1311.9
a virus being shedded

1308.84 --> 1314.36
or whether it is these Spike proteins

1311.9 --> 1316.539
popping out of the body and spreading

1314.36 --> 1316.539
around

1321.14 --> 1324.919
right

1322.58 --> 1326.72
that's what I got out of it that's why I

1324.919 --> 1329.44
called out shedding

1326.72 --> 1329.44
to be

1329.799 --> 1333.58
basically propaganda

1333.919 --> 1340.64
are more like counter propaganda

1338.419 --> 1342.6200000000001
because vaccine situation everything

1340.64 --> 1345.76
about it is propaganda

1342.62 --> 1345.76
and this is like

1345.799 --> 1352.82
counter propaganda potentially based on

1349.58 --> 1354.74
propaganda that that were part of the

1352.82 --> 1356.24
vaccines right

1354.74 --> 1359.0
it's

1356.24 --> 1361.22
it's really difficult to tell but if

1359.0 --> 1364.28
there was literal shedding in a

1361.22 --> 1366.6200000000001
virus-like fashion and everybody would

1364.28 --> 1368.8999999999999
be getting it then it's all over dude it

1366.62 --> 1372.6399999999999
doesn't matter anymore then it's

1368.9 --> 1372.64
literally all over

1373.94 --> 1378.6200000000001
because what would prevent that same

1376.22 --> 1380.48
[ __ ] from spreading to animals

1378.62 --> 1383.36
to plants

1380.48 --> 1387.46
to everything

1383.36 --> 1387.4599999999998
it's ridiculous

1396.02 --> 1401.96
girls psycho has been [ __ ] right okay

1398.72 --> 1405.82
but that's something else that's not

1401.96 --> 1405.82
because you go

1406.039 --> 1410.539
how's she doing by the way

1408.44 --> 1413.72
I hope not too bad

1410.539 --> 1416.12
yeah that's not because she got Spike

1413.72 --> 1419.299
protein shedded on her

1416.12 --> 1421.6999999999998
that's because of proximity it's because

1419.299 --> 1423.74
of other things other elements that are

1421.7 --> 1426.74
also happening the vaccine does really

1423.74 --> 1428.419
weird [ __ ] to people it magnetizes them

1426.74 --> 1432.52
sometimes

1428.419 --> 1436.24
it influences them in a way

1432.52 --> 1436.24
that kind of like

1438.38 --> 1445.159
does something just with the the natural

1441.38 --> 1447.74
Radiance with your aura perhaps

1445.159 --> 1450.0800000000002
right it does something

1447.74 --> 1451.58
and

1450.08 --> 1454.4189999999999
yeah

1451.58 --> 1458.6
like things normally like people yes

1454.419 --> 1461.8400000000001
like women might that hang around a lot

1458.6 --> 1464.0
might sync up in their menstrual cycles

1461.84 --> 1466.6999999999998
that's not because something is being

1464.0 --> 1469.7
shedded right if if there was no vaccine

1466.7 --> 1471.74
involved that just happens right well I

1469.7 --> 1473.6000000000001
think by that same system that that

1471.74 --> 1475.22
synchronization which is more Spirit

1473.6 --> 1477.32
based than any

1475.22 --> 1479.3600000000001
physical thing

1477.32 --> 1482.36
that's being spread around

1479.36 --> 1484.6399999999999
I think in the same way people that have

1482.36 --> 1487.6999999999998
taken vaccines get really warped

1484.64 --> 1492.3200000000002
situations some really weird magnetic

1487.7 --> 1494.72
[ __ ] or whatever going on and that might

1492.32 --> 1497.48
rub off not literally

1494.72 --> 1499.52
but like it might cause the same kind of

1497.48 --> 1500.9
distortions in people that hang around

1499.52 --> 1502.94
with them

1500.9 --> 1505.279
but it's not because of some physical

1502.94 --> 1507.799
product that is being leaked on the

1505.279 --> 1509.9
other individual it's because of the

1507.799 --> 1511.1589999999999
radiance of the person that took the

1509.9 --> 1513.6200000000001
vaccine

1511.159 --> 1517.22
something else going on it's not just

1513.62 --> 1520.76
freaking Spike protein that's just one

1517.22 --> 1523.52
palpable element of the process

1520.76 --> 1526.279
there's other things going on as well

1523.52 --> 1530.5
and it I find it a little mysterious

1526.279 --> 1530.5
even how what's what's happening there

1535.1 --> 1541.1
yes rest a hat I know

1538.159 --> 1542.779
that is where it will concentrate if you

1541.1 --> 1544.6999999999998
have the production of it in your body

1542.779 --> 1547.7
that's right that's what causes

1544.7 --> 1547.7
miscarriages

1548.0 --> 1551.38
it is sweated out

1558.98 --> 1564.26
yeah but who is to say that if you're

1561.44 --> 1566.3600000000001
getting that externally without them

1564.26 --> 1568.22
being produced inside of your body who

1566.36 --> 1569.9599999999998
says that you're going to just your body

1568.22 --> 1572.299
is going to assimilate these bad

1569.96 --> 1576.38
proteins

1572.299 --> 1578.12
through skin touch or whatever or

1576.38 --> 1581.0
through breathing

1578.12 --> 1585.039
the dust of it in like who says your

1581.0 --> 1585.039
body will just assimilate all that

1585.38 --> 1588.46
it's toxic

1600.14 --> 1606.5800000000002
yes Rasta had I know that I'm literally

1603.2 --> 1606.5800000000002
addressing it right now

1608.059 --> 1614.1789999999999
look if you insist that it's really that

1612.62 --> 1616.76
heavy

1614.179 --> 1618.74
that Spike proteins are like oh your

1616.76 --> 1620.779
body just as soon as you touch it it

1618.74 --> 1623.48
starts to absorb it and then gather the

1620.779 --> 1626.539
spike proteins from externally

1623.48 --> 1628.82
well then that should be testable

1626.539 --> 1631.34
right

1628.82 --> 1635.1789999999999
then test for Spike proteins in the

1631.34 --> 1637.58
unfaxed test it how much is in there

1635.179 --> 1640.8200000000002
is it starting to build up over time

1637.58 --> 1642.9189999999999
even when not get well hanging around

1640.82 --> 1646.48
with vaccinated people

1642.919 --> 1646.48
I know you're not spamming

1654.919 --> 1658.48
hey clutch Bear by the way

1659.38 --> 1664.3600000000001
what's what dude what's with the address

1676.279 --> 1683.36
uh clutchware you do realize that that

1680.48 --> 1686.38
is literally just appearing in my chat

1683.36 --> 1686.3799999999999
right on screen

1692.899 --> 1695.559
whatever

1704.48 --> 1710.26
I didn't write it down oh wait it was

1706.88 --> 1710.2600000000002
for seeking sterile water okay

1713.659 --> 1717.5590000000002
I don't know why you would put that in

1715.88 --> 1719.779
this chat here why don't you just get

1717.559 --> 1721.6399999999999
each other's email addresses and do it

1719.779 --> 1724.7
that way that seems a little bit more

1721.64 --> 1726.88
secure than putting it in a public chat

1724.7 --> 1726.88
foreign

1736.539 --> 1742.7
maker says it's self-replicating

1739.88 --> 1745.6000000000001
well why don't they show a demonstration

1742.7 --> 1745.6000000000001
of that then

1747.14 --> 1753.6200000000001
show a microscope demonstration of the

1749.899 --> 1753.62
spike protein self-replicating

1766.279 --> 1775.34
right so I think that since the virus in

1770.539 --> 1778.1
general is purely a fear-based operation

1775.34 --> 1779.779
and that well that excludes well what's

1778.1 --> 1782.1789999999999
happening with the vaccine

1779.779 --> 1784.52
I think that it's just

1782.179 --> 1787.7
even in the narrative people are just

1784.52 --> 1791.299
very eager to latch onto an idea of some

1787.7 --> 1793.48
kind of viral influence

1791.299 --> 1796.059
viral danger oh it's going to spread

1793.48 --> 1798.44
self-replication so I think there's just

1796.059 --> 1801.3799999999999
generally a lot of rumors of

1798.44 --> 1804.5800000000002
self-replication happening right now

1801.38 --> 1804.5800000000002
with elements

1804.919 --> 1809.48
uh I'd like to see some backing for

1807.559 --> 1813.94
those claims

1809.48 --> 1813.94
I wouldn't just take it for granted

1818.36 --> 1824.6589999999999
yeah they do want it and everyone

1821.059 --> 1828.32
but if it was that easy to get it in

1824.659 --> 1831.7990000000002
everyone they wouldn't push so hard for

1828.32 --> 1834.5
everybody everybody to take the vaccine

1831.799 --> 1835.82
because then they just need a couple of

1834.5 --> 1838.399
people

1835.82 --> 1840.62
they wouldn't even talk about it and

1838.399 --> 1841.8799999999999
then they'd just send them out there and

1840.62 --> 1845.08
let it spread

1841.88 --> 1845.0800000000002
if that was the case

1847.34 --> 1855.62
right then they wouldn't need everybody

1852.159 --> 1857.8600000000001
officially to get it if that was the

1855.62 --> 1857.86
case

1887.539 --> 1891.94
yeah and then there's that good servant

1922.76 --> 1927.86
yeah that might be true rest ahead but

1925.64 --> 1930.14
the problem is

1927.86 --> 1933.34
through doing all this what they do

1930.14 --> 1933.3400000000001
being so public

1933.62 --> 1939.7399999999998
about this crazy situation it's it

1937.279 --> 1941.24
brings them at risk if they really

1939.74 --> 1943.519
wanted to just

1941.24 --> 1945.799
kill Humanity

1943.519 --> 1948.32
why would they build up this theater

1945.799 --> 1951.3799999999999
make everybody

1948.32 --> 1954.08
realize who they are and yeah a bunch of

1951.38 --> 1957.7600000000002
idiots they just don't learn about it

1954.08 --> 1957.76
and they just go with everything

1958.58 --> 1963.32
but they're exposed why would they do

1961.159 --> 1965.72
that

1963.32 --> 1968.6589999999999
if it was that is if it could have been

1965.72 --> 1972.919
much easier to just then

1968.659 --> 1975.8600000000001
get people get that experimental [ __ ]

1972.919 --> 1977.3600000000001
move out there don't even talk about it

1975.86 --> 1979.1
and guess what it's going to spread

1977.36 --> 1981.82
around and then after a while everybody

1979.1 --> 1981.82
has it

1982.64 --> 1987.44
and then it could be oh it was an

1984.679 --> 1990.14
accident oh didn't know the consequences

1987.44 --> 1993.919
we had not foreseen this right there's

1990.14 --> 1995.48
so much more easy ways to achieve your

1993.919 --> 1999.159
goal

1995.48 --> 2002.019
if the spike protein was literally

1999.159 --> 2004.779
self-replicating and you wouldn't need

2002.019 --> 2009.7
all this giant theater and suppression

2004.779 --> 2009.7
and risk that comes with it exposure

2027.159 --> 2031.0800000000002
yeah it makes no sense dude

2034.0 --> 2037.779
if the spike protein was

2035.74 --> 2040.84
self-replicating

2037.779 --> 2044.82
outside of vaccine recipient then they

2040.84 --> 2048.8199999999997
would never have needed any of the

2044.82 --> 2048.8199999999997
dramatic actions

2053.079 --> 2056.52
it just doesn't match

2061.359 --> 2063.72
all right

2068.56 --> 2070.74
foreign

2076.679 --> 2082.44
merging with AI That's that's just a

2079.419 --> 2082.44
rumor Paul Connor

2092.5 --> 2096.879
but you're talking about that's fine

2094.359 --> 2099.339
that's fine

2096.879 --> 2100.96
there's no evidence that Spike proteins

2099.339 --> 2103.5
are self-replicating

2100.96 --> 2103.5
right

2103.72 --> 2109.48
I'll consider it again once I get some

2106.3 --> 2111.4
actual empirical evidence that they do

2109.48 --> 2114.839
with some visual demonstration

2111.4 --> 2119.56
microscope level right until that time

2114.839 --> 2119.56
it's just another rumor

2125.8 --> 2129.54
I've already gave explanation

2130.02 --> 2134.38
how this

2131.98 --> 2136.72
thing might be happening out there that

2134.38 --> 2138.7200000000003
is associated with shedding being in the

2136.72 --> 2141.7599999999998
presence of vaccinated people doing

2138.72 --> 2144.66
things with you with your body with your

2141.76 --> 2147.7000000000003
Cycles right already explained it

2144.66 --> 2149.56
completely excluding the idea that the

2147.7 --> 2151.359
spike protein literally has anything to

2149.56 --> 2155.88
do with it

2151.359 --> 2155.88
other reasons why that's happening

2159.28 --> 2162.96
yeah you do that rest that

2177.28 --> 2179.82
okay

2213.64 --> 2217.5
hello ajm good to see you

2222.579 --> 2226.7400000000002
no good servant that's ridiculous

2272.859 --> 2277.98
if I was a baller I tell you to look it

2275.38 --> 2277.98
up that's right

2279.76 --> 2282.9
glad you're not

2283.06 --> 2287.02
and that you realize that if you're

2284.98 --> 2289.119
going to put yourself behind a certain

2287.02 --> 2291.78
claim that you have to provide the

2289.119 --> 2291.78
evidence for it

2307.42 --> 2309.54
thank you

2310.0 --> 2312.599
right

2317.56 --> 2323.46
but yeah to to bring it back to what

2325.54 --> 2328.14
the copter

2330.46 --> 2335.7400000000002
what good servant said

2332.44 --> 2338.28
only Jews reject Jesus Christ that's

2335.74 --> 2338.2799999999997
nonsense

2340.18 --> 2342.66
right

2345.4 --> 2350.02
it's just not true

2348.46 --> 2352.0
I mean

2350.02 --> 2354.94
philosophically

2352.0 --> 2358.18
Jews don't accept that he is a literal

2354.94 --> 2360.64
incarnation of God perhaps right oh my

2358.18 --> 2363.7799999999997
God how dare they

2360.64 --> 2363.7799999999997
that's pretty much it

2363.94 --> 2371.32
those people that say uh he's he's evil

2368.26 --> 2374.5600000000004
he will burn in hell in a lake of [ __ ]

2371.32 --> 2375.52
or something that's not a Jew

2374.56 --> 2377.2
foreign

2375.52 --> 2380.74
yeah

2377.2 --> 2383.4399999999996
those are grabblers

2380.74 --> 2387.52
satanists

2383.44 --> 2391.02
that like to hide under the cover of you

2387.52 --> 2391.02
those are grabblers

2394.839 --> 2401.52
if you're a real Jew a tauren

2397.839 --> 2401.52
then you'll have respect

2401.56 --> 2405.96
for the character of Jesus one way or

2403.78 --> 2405.96
another

2406.839 --> 2412.119
and you'll probably if you do it right

2409.42 --> 2417.1800000000003
have respect in general

2412.119 --> 2417.1800000000003
because it's more about a life attitude

2430.359 --> 2434.619
I hope all people make it what are you

2433.0 --> 2437.579
talking about

2434.619 --> 2437.579
ridiculous

2445.96 --> 2450.9
then you're hoping for something that is

2448.18 --> 2450.8999999999996
just futile

2452.619 --> 2458.5
why would you hope for somebody to make

2454.78 --> 2460.6800000000003
it when they themselves hope to not make

2458.5 --> 2460.68
it

2478.66 --> 2483.04
that's not what you meant well you said

2481.0 --> 2485.2
I hope all people make it and then

2483.04 --> 2489.0
capital letters all people I don't see

2485.2 --> 2489.0
how to interpret it any other way

2512.68 --> 2516.24
I mean grabblers

2516.819 --> 2519.48
what

2521.5 --> 2527.579
are you late responding to my late

2524.2 --> 2527.5789999999997
response to what you said

2530.8 --> 2535.9
so I said with the what why don't you

2532.96 --> 2538.859
just say Grapplers then why did you have

2535.9 --> 2542.7000000000003
to go revert back to that word

2538.859 --> 2542.7
that's a giant

2542.94 --> 2550.92
historically traditional straw man word

2547.0 --> 2550.92
right why would you use that

2551.2 --> 2555.06
if you could just say Grappler

2569.079 --> 2573.48
Steve's being a fantasist and what how

2578.22 --> 2581.7599999999998
oh come on

2583.599 --> 2586.26
dude

2591.04 --> 2594.96
started weed whacking right now

2621.7 --> 2625.4399999999996
I hope it's all cleared up yeah yeah

2629.619 --> 2636.28
can we talk about Werner from Browns

2632.44 --> 2636.28
Tombstone uh

2640.9 --> 2647.02
what what do you need to talk about it

2643.24 --> 2650.7
it that's been known forever

2647.02 --> 2650.7
that was like one of the main

2651.04 --> 2657.819
items even in 2015.

2654.339 --> 2661.24
like oh don't forget to mention that all

2657.819 --> 2664.5
right everybody knows about that

2661.24 --> 2664.5
what is it doing there

2669.46 --> 2676.8
it seems like it's a underhanded

2673.18 --> 2676.7999999999997
post death confession

2677.56 --> 2682.599
because he yeah what he was occupying

2680.26 --> 2684.6400000000003
himself with he was basically by using

2682.599 --> 2690.3
that confessing

2684.64 --> 2690.2999999999997
that like yeah it's all fabricated

2692.14 --> 2696.66
or at least it suggests that

2696.76 --> 2701.1600000000003
because of the nature of the word

2698.44 --> 2701.16
firmament

2702.64 --> 2707.7999999999997
now of course it's not super specific

2705.16 --> 2710.6189999999997
that word that's kind of a bit of a

2707.8 --> 2713.98
problem so it leaves some room for doubt

2710.619 --> 2717.28
for those that demand

2713.98 --> 2719.98
to reify all of the space stuff into

2717.28 --> 2722.6800000000003
reality right but it is basically an

2719.98 --> 2725.22
underhanded confession like yeah I know

2722.68 --> 2729.0
about this

2725.22 --> 2729.0
it's all a game

2730.9 --> 2734.579
so that's how I see that

2742.3 --> 2748.0
having fantasies of Grapplers in heaven

2745.06 --> 2751.7999999999997
dude

2748.0 --> 2751.8
Grapplers in heaven that's

2753.88 --> 2757.6800000000003
what the hell would they do there

2759.26 --> 2762.449
[Music]

2765.46 --> 2773.339
to a Grappler to be in heaven is like

2769.0 --> 2773.339
hell because there's nobody to grabble

2785.92 --> 2790.6800000000003
or everyone gets a free tiny head okay

2796.48 --> 2802.619
he said we live in a container with gas

2798.94 --> 2802.619
pressure well indirectly

2804.88 --> 2810.2400000000002
it could be inferred yes Paul Connell

2817.48 --> 2822.28
I want to be better but well why don't

2819.4 --> 2825.96
you start good servant by stop referring

2822.28 --> 2825.96
to yourself as boy

2827.68 --> 2833.0789999999997
and actually start regarding yourself as

2830.68 --> 2835.1189999999997
a man instead

2833.079 --> 2838.1800000000003
right

2835.119 --> 2840.76
maybe you don't need to be a better boy

2838.18 --> 2842.5
I think you're already good enough

2840.76 --> 2844.42
been over the top sometimes about

2842.5 --> 2846.88
certain elements

2844.42 --> 2850.92
just gonna be a man

2846.88 --> 2850.92
I think that would be a better striving

2861.46 --> 2865.319
oh you were quoting Ira okay

2868.359 --> 2872.859
well next time

2870.16 --> 2875.68
put some quotations

2872.859 --> 2878.7599999999998
around that sentence then oh I'm

2875.68 --> 2878.7599999999998
squirting out right right right

2880.48 --> 2884.559
yeah I want to be a better boy but

2882.28 --> 2886.78
that's the thing you know even from that

2884.559 --> 2890.8190000000004
from that Ira video

2886.78 --> 2890.8190000000004
the animated one was brilliant

2891.4 --> 2894.339
he doesn't really want to be a better

2893.44 --> 2897.2200000000003
boy

2894.339 --> 2899.319
it's just virtue signaling like I want

2897.22 --> 2901.359
to be with you too I know I have to be

2899.319 --> 2902.859
better so I want to be a better boy he

2901.359 --> 2905.02
doesn't really want to be a better boy

2902.859 --> 2906.7599999999998
he just doesn't want to be alone in that

2905.02 --> 2909.16
moment

2906.76 --> 2911.0200000000004
and then of course he immediately proves

2909.16 --> 2915.839
he doesn't really want to be better boy

2911.02 --> 2915.839
by immediately squirting right after

2925.119 --> 2930.819
okay enough with the squirting it I find

2928.42 --> 2933.059
it very Troublesome to see you say that

2930.819 --> 2933.0589999999997
word

2936.4 --> 2940.619
you'd make a very scary Graveler

2956.68 --> 2960.48
okay Pocono I don't know

2962.619 --> 2967.0
BLM Ben the word boy what who gives a

2966.04 --> 2969.64
[ __ ]

2967.0 --> 2971.92
freaking BLM dude

2969.64 --> 2975.04
it's a freaking communist terrorist

2971.92 --> 2977.2000000000003
organization [ __ ] them everything they

2975.04 --> 2979.0
do and say it's like literally they can

2977.2 --> 2983.2
as far as I'm concerned they can

2979.0 --> 2985.559
literally just ban all language right I

2983.2 --> 2985.5589999999997
don't care

2987.28 --> 2993.1600000000003
be an absolute

2989.68 --> 2995.3799999999997
idiot and a [ __ ] and do what they say

2993.16 --> 3001.04
[ __ ] them

2995.38 --> 3001.04
just everything they ask just [ __ ] them

3004.68 --> 3009.0
let them erase their own minds if they

3007.38 --> 3012.619
want

3009.0 --> 3012.619
just don't be a part of it

3018.24 --> 3024.5589999999997
I would give money away I know you'd

3020.88 --> 3024.559
make a terrible terrible Grappler

3026.579 --> 3028.76
foreign

3061.13 --> 3064.309
[Music]

3075.96 --> 3082.98
anybody pick up on freaking McAfee

3079.16 --> 3085.74
apparently having been suicided in jail

3082.98 --> 3089.16
freaky like that popped in the news

3085.74 --> 3091.22
everywhere yesterday evening all of a

3089.16 --> 3091.22
sudden

3094.68 --> 3099.1189999999997
how many shekels do you need for 30

3097.14 --> 3101.66
Euros on PayPal

3099.119 --> 3101.6600000000003
what

3103.8 --> 3110.819
I don't know how many shekels would

3107.339 --> 3113.4
translate into 30 Euros

3110.819 --> 3118.16
but I'm pretty sure that PayPal just

3113.4 --> 3118.1600000000003
transforms the currency format

3120.96 --> 3127.14
yeah sleeping word I know it it's

3123.359 --> 3130.2599999999998
everything like he really he freaking

3127.14 --> 3133.68
made a tattoo like and no suicide ever

3130.26 --> 3133.6800000000003
tattoo right

3136.44 --> 3143.099
like if I'd be a person that might take

3139.74 --> 3145.9199999999996
tattoos for any reason then I'd be in

3143.099 --> 3150.0
probably be seduced to maybe take it as

3145.92 --> 3152.76
well but I don't take any tattoos ever

3150.0 --> 3157.64
but yeah the whole thing is just like

3152.76 --> 3157.6400000000003
very blatant in your face

3160.619 --> 3166.8
anyway yeah that happened yesterday so

3163.819 --> 3169.38
Info Wars is probably gonna have items

3166.8 --> 3172.98
about it he was a guest on Infowars as

3169.38 --> 3175.76
well I've seen some stuff from him

3172.98 --> 3175.76

3243.599 --> 3247.8590000000004
together by surface tension

3245.96 --> 3250.14
I thought you were literally gonna

3247.859 --> 3254.0

3250.14 --> 3254.0
something but yeah it was a square

that

3469.44 --> 3474.54

it keeps me out of debt

3520.319 --> 3522.5
foreign

3524.42 --> 3530.28
you can't post links in chat what why

3528.0 --> 3533.24
are you posting it there

3530.28 --> 3533.2400000000002
in Skype

3542.46 --> 3545.059
okay

3550.26 --> 3552.92
hmm

3556.2 --> 3558.5589999999997
foreign

3562.76 --> 3567.9
that does look like kind of a fun setup

3565.619 --> 3569.94
though it's very old-fashioned stage

3567.9 --> 3572.599
setup

3569.94 --> 3572.599
all right

3573.0 --> 3579.74
okay I will link

3575.94 --> 3579.7400000000002
to it in the chat thanks for that

3580.319 --> 3586.5
I might check it out later

3583.16 --> 3588.74
although my expectations are not too

3586.5 --> 3588.74
high

3598.98 --> 3601.64
all right

3603.48 --> 3606.619
I'll check it out

3609.0 --> 3614.78
I wonder if a major war will break out

3612.119 --> 3614.78
why

3632.82 --> 3637.76
[Music]

3634.26 --> 3637.76
hello Mike overall

3638.22 --> 3643.9399999999996
yeah clutch bear I wouldn't be too

3640.68 --> 3643.94
scared you know

3649.2 --> 3652.2799999999997
like what

3652.5 --> 3659.099
what groups would do that like really

3656.22 --> 3662.22
start rolling out tanks and airplanes

3659.099 --> 3664.799
aircraft carriers and Rockets and [ __ ]

3662.22 --> 3668.2799999999997
like what why would that

3664.799 --> 3672.0
be the only choice left I don't see it

3668.28 --> 3674.28
I think that globalism in the format is

3672.0 --> 3677.04
rolling out is and counter globalism

3674.28 --> 3679.26
which is also globalism in another

3677.04 --> 3683.099
setting

3679.26 --> 3684.9
it's all globalism guys all of it

3683.099 --> 3688.38
one way or the other

3684.9 --> 3691.799
because that's the game I don't see like

3688.38 --> 3694.02
hot Wars on a big scale habit like why

3691.799 --> 3695.88
would they do that

3694.02 --> 3697.92
don't they have pretty much everything

3695.88 --> 3698.94
going in the direction they want it to

3697.92 --> 3702.079
go

3698.94 --> 3702.079
from all sides

3702.119 --> 3709.4
why would it ever lead to like a real

3705.119 --> 3709.4
big war I don't see it

3709.44 --> 3711.7400000000002
right

3711.839 --> 3716.339
the war is rather

3714.599 --> 3722.2400000000002
on the people

3716.339 --> 3722.24
locks Downs vaccination checkpoints

3724.44 --> 3729.98
how does that lead to a hot War I don't

3727.559 --> 3729.98
see it

3731.76 --> 3739.2000000000003
right it didn't these things didn't lead

3734.76 --> 3744.079
to hot wars in the past no

3739.2 --> 3744.0789999999997
the hot wars were before that [ __ ]

3747.9 --> 3752.839
so yeah

3750.599 --> 3752.839
foreign

3752.96 --> 3757.44
there might be some confrontations here

3755.819 --> 3761.46
and there

3757.44 --> 3765.859
but a truly escalating World War

3761.46 --> 3765.859
scenario I don't see it happening

3776.94 --> 3779.94
okay

3782.819 --> 3785.5389999999998
foreign

3797.579 --> 3800.579
26

3810.299 --> 3812.299
.

3814.68 --> 3820.5789999999997
yeah yeah Pocono there's a lot of people

3817.44 --> 3820.579
here with wrenches

3821.46 --> 3824.9
but they all earned it

3825.599 --> 3830.6400000000003
and with great ranches comes great

3828.96 --> 3835.14
responsibility

3830.64 --> 3837.359
and rules which are in the chat box

3835.14 --> 3839.0989999999997
in the description box of the video of

3837.359 --> 3841.799
the YouTube video

3839.099 --> 3845.6400000000003
and hey some here have gotten wrenches

3841.799 --> 3848.28
have to had them re retracted

3845.64 --> 3851.0989999999997
and some got it even back again

3848.28 --> 3853.3190000000004
right so the wrenches are not just

3851.099 --> 3855.539
random

3853.319 --> 3858.119
you gotta earn it

3855.539 --> 3860.76
and it starts with trust

3858.119 --> 3863.039
and it's really random and you can ask

3860.76 --> 3865.8590000000004
for it in chat that's that's the first

3863.039 --> 3869.9
rule you don't ask for wrench

3865.859 --> 3869.9
you just get one when the time is right

3876.48 --> 3882.38
did you read about what I said Joe and

3878.7 --> 3882.3799999999997
walking off the show no I didn't

3882.839 --> 3886.2799999999997
must have missed that part

3899.48 --> 3905.18
but I'll see it and when it happens

3901.68 --> 3905.18
because I got the video now

3921.42 --> 3928.44
yeah that's right AGM World War III is

3924.96 --> 3929.94
mostly in our minds it's a mind War

3928.44 --> 3932.339
right

3929.94 --> 3935.52
why did they need the war

3932.339 --> 3937.859
to get a grip on our minds and to be

3935.52 --> 3939.48
able to direct them in a more

3937.859 --> 3942.5389999999998
predictable way

3939.48 --> 3946.5
well the wars were near their actual

3942.539 --> 3950.039
cause a lot of damage damage

3946.5 --> 3953.039
usually ends up not good for business

3950.039 --> 3956.3390000000004
decreases profit so yeah

3953.039 --> 3957.8390000000004
instead now what they do is they make us

3956.339 --> 3960.299
believe

3957.839 --> 3962.64
there is a war happening

3960.299 --> 3964.079
whether that there's a threat

3962.64 --> 3966.66
and through

3964.079 --> 3969.3590000000004
that indoctrination people start to

3966.66 --> 3971.5789999999997
believe it and act as if it were really

3969.359 --> 3974.22
happening

3971.579 --> 3975.78
right so then they got a win-win

3974.22 --> 3978.0589999999997
situation out of it they got the people

3975.78 --> 3979.92
under a certain level of control without

3978.059 --> 3984.2400000000002
having to

3979.92 --> 3987.48
pay for damages afterward take losses

3984.24 --> 3990.299
because it was actually War because it

3987.48 --> 3992.819
was actual damage right not saying that

3990.299 --> 3995.28
actual damage never happens right the

3992.819 --> 3998.64
crazy riots

3995.28 --> 4002.3590000000004
from 2020 in the United States causes

3998.64 --> 4005.799
caused absurd levels of damage

4002.359 --> 4005.799
right that is real

4008.42 --> 4012.079
I don't exactly know like how that

4010.88 --> 4016.119
worked

4012.079 --> 4016.119
like why they let that happen

4016.22 --> 4022.0989999999997
but yeah my case kind of stands like why

4019.7 --> 4024.4399999999996
would you go into an actual physical war

4022.099 --> 4026.48
with actual physical damage when you can

4024.44 --> 4028.46
just achieve the same effect by

4026.48 --> 4030.38
convincing people that it is as good as

4028.46 --> 4035.42
real

4030.38 --> 4038.059
making them malleable in that way

4035.42 --> 4040.76
so you can stare them as Grabbers or

4038.059 --> 4043.46
controllers and then you don't have to

4040.76 --> 4047.119
go full out war and just cause a whole

4043.46 --> 4048.28
bunch of damage everywhere and deaths

4047.119 --> 4050.7200000000003
right

4048.28 --> 4052.76
and if that understanding is there then

4050.72 --> 4054.6189999999997
you could even have like grandstanding

4052.76 --> 4058.96
situations

4054.619 --> 4058.96
where who said it in chat

4059.059 --> 4066.7400000000002
what's that

4061.819 --> 4069.02
clutch bear Russia shooting education

4066.74 --> 4071.66
and China being there

4069.02 --> 4073.7599999999998
everybody getting scared right well that

4071.66 --> 4076.0989999999997
seems like grandstanding that's like oh

4073.76 --> 4079.88
look at me look at me right

4076.099 --> 4081.7400000000002
but like they know if it's literally

4079.88 --> 4085.579
going to be

4081.74 --> 4087.5589999999997
that if that escalates to real war if

4085.579 --> 4091.099
that's the possibility that that could

4087.559 --> 4094.2200000000003
happen they know like nobody wants that

4091.099 --> 4097.9400000000005
it's too much damage everywhere it's

4094.22 --> 4101.0
terrible terrible for morale everything

4097.94 --> 4103.2789999999995
it's gonna yeah so it's I to me it just

4101.0 --> 4105.62
seems like grandstanding

4103.279 --> 4108.14
right I'm pretty sure that sort of thing

4105.62 --> 4109.94
happened a lot during the Cold war

4108.14 --> 4113.259
between the US

4109.94 --> 4113.259
and Russia as well

4113.659 --> 4117.92
it was more about like oh it could

4115.64 --> 4120.1990000000005
happen it could happen oh look at us oh

4117.92 --> 4122.179
we're not afraid the Soviet Union in

4120.199 --> 4125.299
America like We're Not Gonna Take your

4122.179 --> 4127.46
freedom Robin and just like uh we are

4125.299 --> 4129.319
strong we're strong everybody's shedding

4127.46 --> 4130.58
their pants like oh my God nuclear war

4129.319 --> 4134.96
could break out

4130.58 --> 4138.199
yet no actual nuclear war broke out and

4134.96 --> 4139.759
the damage is still present of course in

4138.199 --> 4142.339
situations

4139.759 --> 4144.859
didn't escalate to half the world being

4142.339 --> 4147.259
destroyed yet everybody was Spellbound

4144.859 --> 4148.58
by it

4147.259 --> 4151.179
right

4148.58 --> 4154.5199999999995
everybody was Spellbound by it

4151.179 --> 4157.4
absolutely they were

4154.52 --> 4159.259
couldn't escape from the sensation like

4157.4 --> 4161.299
yeah Russia and America are added

4159.259 --> 4162.98
nuclear war could destroy the world any

4161.299 --> 4165.859
moment

4162.98 --> 4168.08
oh they're grandstanding again oh no is

4165.859 --> 4170.719
it gonna happen right that that effect

4168.08 --> 4172.58
it did a trick

4170.719 --> 4174.319
with minimal damage and they're now

4172.58 --> 4177.3189999999995
doing it again

4174.319 --> 4180.219
but on a world scale not just America

4177.319 --> 4180.219
and Russia

4188.299 --> 4190.719
what

4202.1 --> 4207.6990000000005
foreign

4203.36 --> 4207.699
you're happy not to be wrenched okay

4207.8 --> 4213.6990000000005
our nuclear weapons real or fake

4211.04 --> 4213.699
uh

4214.76 --> 4221.900000000001
I don't think they're real in the

4218.08 --> 4224.98
mechanical sense as they're told

4221.9 --> 4224.98
foretold they are

4225.62 --> 4231.82
but I'm not a hundred percent sure

4229.28 --> 4235.34
there might be some

4231.82 --> 4238.34
mysterious explosive processes that are

4235.34 --> 4240.32
associated with nuclear explosions

4238.34 --> 4243.5
who knows maybe they figured it out

4240.32 --> 4245.599999999999
after the Manhattan Project after they

4243.5 --> 4247.04
did the trickery that they do have

4245.6 --> 4248.780000000001
something real

4247.04 --> 4251.12
something real

4248.78 --> 4253.699
that we don't really understand or that

4251.12 --> 4255.199
is not even officially recognized I

4253.699 --> 4258.5199999999995
don't know

4255.199 --> 4261.759999999999
but the idea of the nuclear fission bomb

4258.52 --> 4264.1990000000005
and the radiation Fallout

4261.76 --> 4268.34
very sure that that's

4264.199 --> 4269.659
that that's utter hotter hardship

4268.34 --> 4272.96
right

4269.659 --> 4275.719
at the same measure yeah they're big

4272.96 --> 4278.6
freaking bombs

4275.719 --> 4282.04
that shatter mountains

4278.6 --> 4285.5
and there is freaking Fire Bomb

4282.04 --> 4288.62
firebombing which is horrific and per

4285.5 --> 4291.14
default a crime against humanity

4288.62 --> 4294.8
when it's applied

4291.14 --> 4298.68
which are an obvious part of the act of

4294.8 --> 4299.78
nukes right so there are basically two

4298.68 --> 4302.38
[Music]

4299.78 --> 4302.38
very

4302.6 --> 4308.1990000000005
two events that stand out to me during

4305.3 --> 4308.1990000000005
World War II

4308.26 --> 4313.46
firebombing of Japan

4310.64 --> 4317.4800000000005
posing as nukes

4313.46 --> 4319.64
and the firebombing of Germany which has

4317.48 --> 4323.259999999999
been declined as

4319.64 --> 4323.26
being posed as a nuke

4323.54 --> 4328.0
right it's basically the same thing

4331.82 --> 4338.0
right it's not just carpet bombs polkano

4335.36 --> 4340.88
carpet bombs yeah they blow buildings up

4338.0 --> 4344.659
and [ __ ] but it's the fire bombs that

4340.88 --> 4346.219
literally just melt everything melt the

4344.659 --> 4350.62
streets

4346.219 --> 4350.62
burn this is horrific

4350.659 --> 4353.62
destroys everything

4356.179 --> 4359.179
uh

4361.34 --> 4364.84
yeah that's right AGM

4369.679 --> 4373.2390000000005
dressed and bombing that's right

4377.659 --> 4383.0
experiment what is that again

4380.3 --> 4385.719
I the name rings a bell I don't remember

4383.0 --> 4385.719
what it was

4394.82 --> 4398.259999999999
besides a movie

4398.6 --> 4402.6990000000005
or are you referring to the movie

4415.94 --> 4420.759999999999
hey Tony Whitcomb

4417.86 --> 4420.759999999999
good to see you

4430.0 --> 4433.88
disappearing ship what are you talking

4432.8 --> 4437.08
about

4433.88 --> 4437.08
steamy Traveler

4440.42 --> 4446.6
oh

4442.76 --> 4449.42
was was that the Philadelphia Experiment

4446.6 --> 4451.159000000001
right it's where they did weird phasing

4449.42 --> 4453.38
[ __ ] right

4451.159 --> 4455.86
they did something really weird with

4453.38 --> 4455.86
some like

4456.98 --> 4463.5199999999995
frequency or electric phasing is very

4461.0 --> 4466.94
bizarre and mysterious

4463.52 --> 4469.540000000001
right so what happened in there was

4466.94 --> 4469.54
basically

4469.699 --> 4472.239
like

4473.199 --> 4478.159
sort of like frequency based

4475.88 --> 4480.1990000000005
liquefaction of the entire ship right

4478.159 --> 4482.239
people literally

4480.199 --> 4484.339999999999
during that experiment

4482.239 --> 4486.919999999999
during The Disappearance reappearance

4484.34 --> 4488.78
they melted into the ship

4486.92 --> 4491.06
they sank through it and then it

4488.78 --> 4493.239
solidified around them again they

4491.06 --> 4496.34
literally sunk through solid metal

4493.239 --> 4499.82
really crazy [ __ ]

4496.34 --> 4501.56
but to me that seems frequency based so

4499.82 --> 4505.04
there's some resonance that would

4501.56 --> 4508.52
literally temporarily turn

4505.04 --> 4510.14
the metal into putty kind of just like

4508.52 --> 4512.659000000001
liquefaction

4510.14 --> 4514.58
certain vibration suddenly caused the

4512.659 --> 4517.219
material to have completely different

4514.58 --> 4518.5
properties

4517.219 --> 4522.38
until

4518.5 --> 4525.38
it stops the vibration stops whatever it

4522.38 --> 4527.7390000000005
is and then it Resorts back to its Old

4525.38 --> 4527.7390000000005
State

4539.6 --> 4544.9400000000005
what

4541.4 --> 4548.799999999999
set a guy from 1984

4544.94 --> 4548.799999999999
appeared on about what

4551.659 --> 4557.679
from the future

4554.02 --> 4557.679
that's really weird

4558.02 --> 4562.2390000000005
about Australian 8012 getting wisdom

4565.06 --> 4569.2390000000005
I've seen that movie but it's been a

4567.5 --> 4572.08
while

4569.239 --> 4572.08
it's really weird

4573.5 --> 4579.34
foreign

4574.54 --> 4579.34
the whole ordeal very unnerving

4590.84 --> 4596.12
cloaking experiment

4593.719 --> 4597.5
well cloaking might have been the

4596.12 --> 4602.78
original

4597.5 --> 4604.88
tactical idea behind it right

4602.78 --> 4608.96
but yeah

4604.88 --> 4611.36
to be cloaked risking literal warping of

4608.96 --> 4614.0
all the materials it doesn't exactly

4611.36 --> 4616.36
make it worth it now does it

4614.0 --> 4619.76
right so yeah cloaking might have been

4616.36 --> 4623.239
the the hoped end result that they would

4619.76 --> 4626.7390000000005
get out of the test right well it didn't

4623.239 --> 4626.739
really turn out to be so

4651.199 --> 4653.44
foreign

4675.02 --> 4681.400000000001
weed whackers are pissed off good could

4678.44 --> 4681.4
use some fresh air

4687.26 --> 4693.219
Flex tube stream I have no though what

4689.96 --> 4693.219
you're talking about Sun now

4723.98 --> 4730.4
oh and yeah by the way clutch bear

4726.38 --> 4732.08
cloaking is spelled with o a

4730.4 --> 4734.799999999999
so

4732.08 --> 4734.8
anyway

4758.78 --> 4765.82
Saint Louis

4761.36 --> 4765.82
okay when did that happen Tony Whitaker

4766.4 --> 4772.099999999999
I think I heard about that

4769.04 --> 4774.679
was also referred to

4772.1 --> 4778.42
for me when that came to attention was

4774.679 --> 4778.42
with the Firefly movie

4778.76 --> 4783.1990000000005
serenity

4780.44 --> 4785.78
because that was kind of the plot

4783.199 --> 4788.839999999999
in there that they did something like

4785.78 --> 4791.659
that except not just a city

4788.84 --> 4794.92
they did it on the entire planet

4791.659 --> 4794.92
on a settlement

4807.92 --> 4819.02
Club Dome plasmus no no iron 26 no

4813.92 --> 4822.38
no that Globe win doesn't need plasma

4819.02 --> 4825.580000000001
[ __ ] so nonsense dude bending of

4822.38 --> 4825.58
space-time does everything

4826.219 --> 4831.86
foreign

4828.86 --> 4834.58
you just have to know how the space time

4831.86 --> 4834.58
is bent

4834.8 --> 4841.28
and then provide a satisfactory story

4837.08 --> 4842.96
that's good enough the plasma no

4841.28 --> 4845.3
like

4842.96 --> 4846.8
yeah you can't keep plasma into his

4845.3 --> 4849.1990000000005
sphere

4846.8 --> 4852.679
with magnetics

4849.199 --> 4855.58
if it's contained it requires a steady

4852.679 --> 4855.58
contained pressure

4855.86 --> 4860.9
so

4858.139 --> 4864.139
yeah plasma is not a

4860.9 --> 4867.32
a good solution to try and prove air

4864.139 --> 4870.1990000000005
which is not what plasma is can be kept

4867.32 --> 4872.86
in a sphere Without Walls

4870.199 --> 4872.86
you can't

4876.38 --> 4880.82
have any theories what nuclear power

4878.179 --> 4883.4
stations do yeah

4880.82 --> 4887.42
it's quite simple

4883.4 --> 4889.339999999999
they have uranium uranium heats water

4887.42 --> 4891.86
water

4889.34 --> 4895.9400000000005
heat causes pressure

4891.86 --> 4899.48
water pressure causes turbines to spin

4895.94 --> 4901.339999999999
turbines produce electricity

4899.48 --> 4904.28
and that's what happens

4901.34 --> 4907.659000000001
and that's pretty much all that happens

4904.28 --> 4907.659
as far as I'm concerned

4910.28 --> 4914.38
it just heats the water that's it

4935.78 --> 4940.48
the link to an article okay

4941.12 --> 4944.5
oh God what's this

4946.28 --> 4953.259999999999
oh Great Pop-Up [ __ ]

4949.76 --> 4953.26
that's just nice

4961.04 --> 4966.92
oh so I have to be very specific at how

4964.1 --> 4970.34
I want no cookies whatsoever

4966.92 --> 4973.88
yeah instead of just say no I don't

4970.34 --> 4975.9800000000005
accept anything I have to manually do

4973.88 --> 4977.719
that first to see it oh that's just

4975.98 --> 4980.379999999999
brilliant

4977.719 --> 4980.38
uh

4982.04 --> 4985.42
that's ridiculous

4990.26 --> 4994.179
visible Dome around the Earth

5005.98 --> 5009.759999999999
it's kind of funny though

5008.02 --> 5011.02
it's not the first time I've heard of

5009.76 --> 5015.219
that

5011.02 --> 5019.139
right but what is it why is it there

5015.219 --> 5019.139
right I I call gravity

5020.02 --> 5023.400000000001
whatever it's supposed to be

5044.8 --> 5047.34
hmm

5055.9 --> 5062.199
Tony Whitcomb okay yeah why does this

5059.26 --> 5065.26
Moon seem like a tiny dot up there and

5062.199 --> 5066.879999999999
so big down here well because it's not a

5065.26 --> 5071.320000000001
physical object

5066.88 --> 5075.34
that abides to the laws of perspective

5071.32 --> 5079.36
that's why because it's holographic

5075.34 --> 5081.639
and there is an alteration as to how

5079.36 --> 5085.239
you get to see it

5081.639 --> 5089.08
that changes over a height distance

5085.239 --> 5091.78
right so not only do the holographics

5089.08 --> 5095.5
of it the way they represent themselves

5091.78 --> 5099.0599999999995
alter by your

5095.5 --> 5099.06
horizontal movement

5099.219 --> 5107.52
it also Alters the perceived phenomena

5104.08 --> 5107.5199999999995
when you move vertically

5131.739 --> 5134.339999999999
what

5153.52 --> 5155.6990000000005
foreign

5160.08 --> 5166.239
traffic I'm arrested I don't know why

5162.4 --> 5169.08
you need to pick on clutch bear so much

5166.239 --> 5169.08
uh

5172.9 --> 5179.339999999999
will I be watching the Dutch soccer game

5176.199 --> 5179.339999999999
yeah sure I will

5184.84 --> 5188.1
yes I will a Jim

5211.36 --> 5217.179
he started it again I don't know man

thank you

5316.3 --> 5319.3
foreign

5325.239 --> 5330.839999999999
what

5327.58 --> 5330.84
is going on here

5331.0 --> 5333.659
uh

5360.94 --> 5363.12
foreign

5363.9 --> 5372.179
's children are restless

5366.78 --> 5372.179
yeah I know the chat's pretty active

5379.96 --> 5385.32
oh

5382.139 --> 5385.32
good stuff

5419.199 --> 5425.28
all right iron 26 see you later

5422.02 --> 5425.280000000001
thanks for being a chat

5438.1 --> 5444.04
hmm okay gaining wisdom good point

5442.0 --> 5446.02
like Secret

5444.04 --> 5451.5
the secret army

5446.02 --> 5451.5
The Unofficial secret army idea yeah

5460.3 --> 5466.179
and that idea in many ways has been

5462.639 --> 5467.8
heavily heavily reinforced through

5466.179 --> 5470.58
through movies

5467.8 --> 5470.58
through Hollywood

5472.06 --> 5479.620000000001
the idea that that's out there

5476.32 --> 5482.58
secret super powered individuals or

5479.62 --> 5482.58
super high tech

5483.46 --> 5489.94
could achieve the work of an entire Army

5487.36 --> 5492.159
but it's unofficial and it's officially

5489.94 --> 5495.46
not admitted yeah that's been super

5492.159 --> 5497.379999999999
super heavily reinforced through

5495.46 --> 5500.38
Hollywood

5497.38 --> 5500.38
sci-fi

5503.92 --> 5510.54
things like Marvel movies and all that

5506.58 --> 5510.54
Superhero [ __ ] yeah

5525.219 --> 5529.44
hey Amanda young see you

5538.659 --> 5544.0599999999995
hello

5540.159 --> 5547.08
I am wt2021

5544.06 --> 5547.080000000001
yeah I'm doing fine

5548.92 --> 5552.06
a little hungry though

5555.82 --> 5557.82
um

5611.32 --> 5615.4
right so

5613.54 --> 5617.199
yeah the subjects are a little bit

5615.4 --> 5621.46
scattered over the place I'm having

5617.199 --> 5625.178999999999
trouble actually picking a subject here

5621.46 --> 5625.179
coming a little incohesive

5626.38 --> 5631.32
so yeah I don't really know what to talk

5628.6 --> 5631.320000000001
about right now

5637.96 --> 5644.08
like yeah cold war tactics and all that

5640.659 --> 5647.879999999999
I laid out a couple of details but

5644.08 --> 5647.88
it's not really a subject

5648.219 --> 5652.62
that I could fill an entire show with

5659.38 --> 5664.86
oh okay Paul Connell don't don't worry

5662.5 --> 5664.86
about it

5674.98 --> 5678.9
let's talk about dinosaurs

5679.84 --> 5684.360000000001
well they are died

5686.679 --> 5691.38
they were died I mean yeah

5691.54 --> 5694.92
what else can you say

5711.88 --> 5717.76
oh

5714.46 --> 5720.639
okay so you're just a [ __ ] [ __ ]

5717.76 --> 5724.9800000000005
okay bye

5720.639 --> 5724.9800000000005
yeah talking about [ __ ] retards

5726.04 --> 5731.159
God I had almost blissfully forgot but

5728.92 --> 5733.78
then the presence of another [ __ ]

5731.159 --> 5736.78
reminded me again

5733.78 --> 5739.259999999999
how incredibly stupid some people are

5736.78 --> 5739.259999999999
out there

5739.36 --> 5745.36
So Yesterday Adam reminded linked us

5743.32 --> 5749.699
through in Skype

5745.36 --> 5754.5
to some freaking thing stream between

5749.699 --> 5754.5
fight the Flat Earth and Santos

5754.84 --> 5761.139
that

5756.46 --> 5763.92
was perhaps the shittiest stream I have

5761.139 --> 5763.92
ever seen

5765.58 --> 5769.42
oh my

5766.96 --> 5772.179
God was that a [ __ ] show that that's

5769.42 --> 5774.179
like that makes a ranty look like a

5772.179 --> 5778.08
professional show host

5774.179 --> 5778.08
holy [ __ ] man

5785.38 --> 5793.2390000000005
like it was just nitpicking just

5790.26 --> 5795.88
nitpicking and complaining and accusing

5793.239 --> 5798.5199999999995
you like oh he's expecting me literally

5795.88 --> 5800.92
he's threatening to kill me he

5798.52 --> 5803.8
threatened to kill me instead of like 50

5800.92 --> 5807.28
times throughout his stream with

5803.8 --> 5810.119000000001
somebody that he has on for the best

5807.28 --> 5810.119
God

5810.28 --> 5816.4
that was the shittiest stream I've ever

5814.54 --> 5819.28
witnessed

5816.4 --> 5820.839999999999
safe to say that I didn't bring my full

5819.28 --> 5824.0199999999995
attention

5820.84 --> 5827.56
but just sporadically listening to it

5824.02 --> 5830.5
and then literally having to turn it off

5827.56 --> 5832.92
after like two minutes or because of a

5830.5 --> 5832.92
headache

5839.679 --> 5844.2390000000005
but like everything about it was [ __ ]

5842.44 --> 5846.699
everything

5844.239 --> 5848.5
the arguments as far as they were even

5846.699 --> 5852.4
present

5848.5 --> 5854.679
like Santas is a freaking [ __ ]

5852.4 --> 5858.58
he really is

5854.679 --> 5862.92
nothing he said made any logical sense

5858.58 --> 5862.92
he is a complete nutcase

5864.82 --> 5869.0199999999995
all right

5866.38 --> 5873.04
I say four years ago

5869.02 --> 5875.26
I had like my doubts like okay well he

5873.04 --> 5877.84
has some strange ideas whatever love but

5875.26 --> 5880.96
who knows well yeah

5877.84 --> 5885.1
how did he freaking degenerate to this

5880.96 --> 5885.1
man this just terrible

5885.639 --> 5892.84
everything he said was pure garbage

5890.26 --> 5897.3
no arguments

5892.84 --> 5900.159000000001
all superficial garbage and delusion

5897.3 --> 5903.9400000000005
presuppositional nonsense everything he

5900.159 --> 5907.78
said was [ __ ] everything Santos said on

5903.94 --> 5912.699
that interview was total garbage

5907.78 --> 5916.0599999999995
everything he said it's all garbage

5912.699 --> 5918.219
one of the worst representations of Flat

5916.06 --> 5920.679
Earth I've ever heard

5918.219 --> 5924.639
and that includes people that are

5920.679 --> 5926.9800000000005
literally paid to be appearing like a

5924.639 --> 5929.639
[ __ ] flat earther okay so that's

5926.98 --> 5929.638999999999
saying something

5935.139 --> 5938.56
right

5936.76 --> 5940.84
and you know there's not much even to

5938.56 --> 5943.84
say about fight to Flat Earth because he

5940.84 --> 5947.26
is so blatantly [ __ ] he doesn't even

5943.84 --> 5951.2390000000005
get to making an argument he is just a

5947.26 --> 5955.179
[ __ ] [ __ ] an idiot a piece of [ __ ]

5951.239 --> 5957.58
scummy disgusting backstabbing little

5955.179 --> 5960.9400000000005
Goblin freak

5957.58 --> 5963.1
that's when he is so there's not even a

5960.94 --> 5966.5199999999995
argument to criticize because he doesn't

5963.1 --> 5969.219
make any he is just being a shitty

5966.52 --> 5971.38
little nasty backstabbing little [ __ ]

5969.219 --> 5974.679
Goblin that's the only thing he ever

5971.38 --> 5977.08
does and I can't even criticize him

5974.679 --> 5978.159
he's just [ __ ]

5977.08 --> 5981.639
right

5978.159 --> 5984.5199999999995
so yeah that's why I normally don't

5981.639 --> 5987.34
go and watch these guys

5984.52 --> 5989.56
but this one stood out to me because it

5987.34 --> 5992.639
was so

5989.56 --> 5992.639
so terrible

5994.54 --> 5999.48
and and people watched that

6000.3 --> 6006.619000000001
And subscribe

6002.4 --> 6006.619
to watch that and then

6008.639 --> 6014.400000000001
then I realized how bad people can allow

6012.36 --> 6017.0
themselves to get

6014.4 --> 6017.0
man

6017.82 --> 6024.38
but overall coming out of that I'm just

6020.94 --> 6028.86
really happy that I'm not a part of that

6024.38 --> 6030.0
and I'm not letting that [ __ ] rub off on

6028.86 --> 6032.759999999999
me

6030.0 --> 6036.44
but I will rant over it when I feel like

6032.76 --> 6036.4400000000005
it and right now I felt like it

6071.699 --> 6077.159
have I ever gone on a global Channel as

6074.76 --> 6080.04
a guest yeah I have a couple of times

6077.159 --> 6082.86
last time was with Mr sensible which

6080.04 --> 6083.639
turned out to be a complete waste of

6082.86 --> 6087.0
time

6083.639 --> 6090.06
since all he did is any time he would

6087.0 --> 6091.44
actually ask me to explain [ __ ] he would

6090.06 --> 6094.080000000001
constantly

6091.44 --> 6098.719
plays stupid

6094.08 --> 6098.719
push button meme [ __ ] over me

6099.239 --> 6105.119
right

6101.28 --> 6107.58
it was a huge waste of my time

6105.119 --> 6109.619
although maybe some people

6107.58 --> 6111.54
with an open mind might have heard

6109.619 --> 6113.219
through all the garbage and might have

6111.54 --> 6114.96
become interested in my channel who

6113.219 --> 6116.639
knows right I basically did for the

6114.96 --> 6120.08
advertising because I knew he was gonna

6116.639 --> 6120.08
waste my time I knew

6121.08 --> 6127.5
but yeah I usually don't go on those

6123.9 --> 6128.879999999999
channels because it's just a waste of

6127.5 --> 6132.659
time

6128.88 --> 6134.82
I don't have time for this clown show

6132.659 --> 6137.28
nonsense

6134.82 --> 6138.9
where it's just about oh make him look

6137.28 --> 6141.239
like this make him look like that oh

6138.9 --> 6143.28
that's the only thing instead of just

6141.239 --> 6144.78
having an open discussion about

6143.28 --> 6147.9
mechanics

6144.78 --> 6150.659
about things that could be

6147.9 --> 6152.58
right I find that much more interesting

6150.659 --> 6155.219
and that's why I like to keep to my

6152.58 --> 6158.46
Daily Show which keeps on going every

6155.219 --> 6162.0
day I'm here every day

6158.46 --> 6164.54
talking about actual things

6162.0 --> 6168.179
without just

6164.54 --> 6172.4
gatekeeping [ __ ] because of some group

6168.179 --> 6172.4
polarization reason nonsense

6173.94 --> 6178.799999999999
like these Ballers are they're only

6176.639 --> 6183.06
interested in their freaking politics

6178.8 --> 6185.6990000000005
now not like their cosmoginy politics

6183.06 --> 6187.56
their Ball versus flat Earth Politics

6185.699 --> 6189.719
the only [ __ ] thing they're

6187.56 --> 6192.4800000000005
interested in

6189.719 --> 6194.639
everything is about that [ __ ] nothing is

6192.48 --> 6196.919999999999
about logic nothing it is about critical

6194.639 --> 6201.42
thinking about sharpening the mind it's

6196.92 --> 6204.659
only about peer pressure garbage

6201.42 --> 6208.92
and just this gloating about oh I'm with

6204.659 --> 6211.98
them oh I'm so good because I'm with the

6208.92 --> 6214.1990000000005
consensus of the ball it's science and

6211.98 --> 6216.299999999999
they're just stupid because they don't

6214.199 --> 6219.419999999999
trust the body of Science and the

6216.3 --> 6221.820000000001
consensus of it's oh I can't even finish

6219.42 --> 6224.78
all that

6221.82 --> 6224.78
ugh

6239.82 --> 6243.659
yes I have steamy traveler I've had a

6242.76 --> 6247.619000000001
couple

6243.659 --> 6250.44
I've had conspiracy cats on my show

6247.619 --> 6251.759999999999
it was pretty cool because I got him on

6250.44 --> 6254.48
my show

6251.76 --> 6257.34
in a calm a reserved manner to basically

6254.48 --> 6260.28
declare by his own volition

6257.34 --> 6262.38
that yeah you require containment to

6260.28 --> 6265.8
have gas pressure

6262.38 --> 6266.52
right it was a cool thing at the at the

6265.8 --> 6268.9800000000005
time

6266.52 --> 6272.9400000000005
I didn't even like hahaha laugh at him

6268.98 --> 6275.4
no it's just like yeah yeah that's right

6272.94 --> 6277.799999999999
that's correct cats

6275.4 --> 6282.0599999999995
so he got on my show some time ago I

6277.8 --> 6284.04
might have had rumpus on here once

6282.06 --> 6286.38
but it would have been short because he

6284.04 --> 6288.54
would just rumpus and blabber all over

6286.38 --> 6291.54
my show kind of ruining it

6288.54 --> 6293.46
I had Brenda on here

6291.54 --> 6295.679
there's also a huge waste of time it's

6293.46 --> 6298.02
pretty much every time I had one of the

6295.679 --> 6302.3
the trench Ballers on my show it just

6298.02 --> 6302.3
turned into a huge waste of time

6302.82 --> 6306.84
but I kind of did it more to demonstrate

6305.52 --> 6311.540000000001
that I can

6306.84 --> 6311.54
and that I'm not afraid of these idiots

6314.46 --> 6319.1
am I going to do anything special no

6321.84 --> 6328.7390000000005
just gonna do the same old [ __ ] over and

6324.78 --> 6329.699
over and over again until I don't know

6328.739 --> 6332.759999999999
foreign

6329.699 --> 6335.0
I get a lot of money and and it changes

6332.76 --> 6335.0
things

6342.6 --> 6349.7390000000005
now I don't have plans for a thousandth

6345.9 --> 6352.92
episode dude I'm already glad that I can

6349.739 --> 6355.138999999999
just literally start up every single day

6352.92 --> 6357.5
and just keep going

6355.139 --> 6357.5
right

6370.38 --> 6375.719
get Mr Oakley oh well yeah why not you

6373.44 --> 6378.0
know hey if the guys want to come on

6375.719 --> 6381.6
on my show on the early bird show if

6378.0 --> 6383.94
it's not too early for them yeah sure

6381.6 --> 6387.02
why not

6383.94 --> 6387.0199999999995
that would be interesting

6388.86 --> 6393.9
if if he wants to

6391.739 --> 6394.98
it might depend a little on what type of

6393.9 --> 6398.159
day

6394.98 --> 6399.0599999999995
the thousandth this the episode would

6398.159 --> 6401.219
fall

6399.06 --> 6403.1990000000005
because if it's in the weekdays then it

6401.219 --> 6405.3
might get in its way but if it's in the

6403.199 --> 6406.44
weekend then it will be sure to be able

6405.3 --> 6408.619000000001
to do that

6406.44 --> 6408.619
foreign

6431.639 --> 6435.900000000001
right but technically at this point I'm

6434.1 --> 6438.360000000001
not really concerned about the numbers

6435.9 --> 6442.099999999999
of my shows anymore

6438.36 --> 6442.099999999999
like I've done enough

6442.619 --> 6448.32
I've just I just don't see the numbers

6445.38 --> 6450.719
really as significant it's just a lot

6448.32 --> 6455.54
that's pretty much it that's it it's

6450.719 --> 6455.54
just like this is show number a lot

6461.58 --> 6466.619
right I'm more much more concerned about

6464.28 --> 6469.28
literally keeping it going I'm more

6466.619 --> 6469.28
concerned about

6469.82 --> 6477.54
finding short-term interesting subjects

6473.34 --> 6479.34
and developments to build upon

6477.54 --> 6482.639
for my show

6479.34 --> 6485.159000000001
tomorrow the day after that's where I'm

6482.639 --> 6487.38
focused I don't really care like oh this

6485.159 --> 6489.0
number I'm gonna look on the agenda when

6487.38 --> 6490.8
this number is going to be and then I'm

6489.0 --> 6493.98
going to organize a party or something

6490.8 --> 6498.139
no no

6493.98 --> 6498.138999999999
not really concerned about that at all

6501.0 --> 6506.3
don't really yeah you know special

6503.82 --> 6506.299999999999
things

6506.58 --> 6513.96
still requires finances and

6509.88 --> 6517.1990000000005
I I get around I I'm not yeah thanks to

6513.96 --> 6519.06
the support here I'm not broke

6517.199 --> 6521.94
but that doesn't mean that I have like

6519.06 --> 6524.159000000001
money to spare for for gadgets or

6521.94 --> 6526.379999999999
special locations like that no not

6524.159 --> 6530.0599999999995
really no

6526.38 --> 6530.06
just trying to keep out of debt

6530.699 --> 6537.0599999999995
Eric Dubai on what do you get on my show

6534.9 --> 6538.98
you think

6537.06 --> 6540.3
I don't even know what he thinks about

6538.98 --> 6543.9
me

6540.3 --> 6547.02
anymore I just remember that you once

6543.9 --> 6547.92
commented about me being a crypto Jew or

6547.02 --> 6551.84
something

6547.92 --> 6551.84
but that was years ago I don't know man

6699.139 --> 6704.36
it wasn't a troll this time I had to

6702.0 --> 6704.36
take it

6704.76 --> 6711.360000000001
for the job of my newspaper rounds that

6708.719 --> 6714.96
is dissolving right they wanted to

6711.36 --> 6717.96
arrange like me returning the bag

6714.96 --> 6717.96
foreign

6732.5 --> 6738.42
dude Rob skiba

6736.08 --> 6741.0599999999995
like in the early years yeah robsky

6738.42 --> 6743.639
about got in the attention a lot I

6741.06 --> 6746.280000000001
followed him too like in 2015 and 16

6743.639 --> 6750.0
especially I kind of lost interest since

6746.28 --> 6754.619
then though he's like really

6750.0 --> 6758.06
super exoteric Christian now so it's I

6754.619 --> 6758.0599999999995
don't really have a lot of connection

6761.699 --> 6768.259999999999
yeah

6763.92 --> 6768.26
seems to be doing very good for himself

6772.679 --> 6779.04
send a message to Eric to come on dude

6777.0 --> 6781.139
hey man

6779.04 --> 6783.42
I'm open for that you know if Eric

6781.139 --> 6786.36
actually wants to do that

6783.42 --> 6788.58
but like does he really want to do that

6786.36 --> 6789.78
or does he still think that I'm kind of

6788.58 --> 6793.08
just

6789.78 --> 6797.04
an annoying guy I don't know man

6793.08 --> 6801.26
he sold masks Rob's keeping it

6797.04 --> 6801.26
what are you talking about Pocono

6810.239 --> 6814.4
Michael sarian yes I've heard of him

6818.82 --> 6823.799999999999
right

6820.86 --> 6827.759999999999
by the way do you have to recognize I

6823.8 --> 6829.7390000000005
use the word esoteric a lot

6827.76 --> 6833.46
but

6829.739 --> 6836.04
problem is a lot of people may end up

6833.46 --> 6840.119
using that word

6836.04 --> 6843.96
and words like ethereal or

6840.119 --> 6846.9
these types of terminologies

6843.96 --> 6850.02
but they might be using it in a slightly

6846.9 --> 6851.28
different angle of approach because it

6850.02 --> 6855.659000000001
is yes

6851.28 --> 6857.699
this aerial and esoteric are very well

6855.659 --> 6861.299999999999
ethereal words

6857.699 --> 6865.199
they're kind of fluid so they can be

6861.3 --> 6867.2390000000005
grasped on in a specific context it's

6865.199 --> 6869.94
very difficult to get a universal

6867.239 --> 6873.119
understanding of this now I have

6869.94 --> 6876.119
personally attempted to do that to

6873.119 --> 6879.48
actually make it very specific

6876.119 --> 6882.119
hoping that it would echo on into the

6879.48 --> 6884.718999999999
world and people would actually use it

6882.119 --> 6888.78
as a standard that way

6884.719 --> 6891.0
by opposing esoteric versus exoteric and

6888.78 --> 6892.32
I I didn't even invent this

6891.0 --> 6894.599
I

6892.32 --> 6895.98
was a stream from a guy I don't even

6894.599 --> 6897.54
freaking remember his name it's now

6895.98 --> 6900.419999999999
years ago

6897.54 --> 6903.78
that also did this

6900.42 --> 6907.1990000000005
and I thought it was really

6903.78 --> 6909.599
memorable so I adopted that system and

6907.199 --> 6914.0
then started explaining things by that

6909.599 --> 6914.0
mechanism exoteric versus esoteric

6915.719 --> 6920.94
am I stupid do not know what esoteric

6918.06 --> 6922.080000000001
means no you're not stupid at all it's a

6920.94 --> 6924.659
very

6922.08 --> 6927.36
convoluted

6924.659 --> 6930.259999999999
complicated word that's very mysterious

6927.36 --> 6930.259999999999
to a whole lot of people

6930.96 --> 6936.54
what what esoteric basically means

6934.56 --> 6937.5
it's also what you go to when you Google

6936.54 --> 6938.639
it

6937.5 --> 6940.98
it's

6938.639 --> 6943.4400000000005
The Hidden

6940.98 --> 6944.759999999999
in their meaning of something

6943.44 --> 6947.36
right

6944.76 --> 6947.360000000001
so

6948.599 --> 6953.76
everything that is said and done

6952.219 --> 6957.78
described

6953.76 --> 6960.659000000001
has layers right has layers of how you

6957.78 --> 6963.9
can approach something that is said

6960.659 --> 6966.42
you can approach it literal you can

6963.9 --> 6969.659
approach it as a symbol you can approach

6966.42 --> 6972.599
it as a metaphor for a social situation

6969.659 --> 6974.94
or an effect there's all kinds of ways

6972.599 --> 6978.119000000001
you can approach it right

6974.94 --> 6981.78
and when you're esoteric

6978.119 --> 6982.92
that basically implies to me in my

6981.78 --> 6985.139
Approach

6982.92 --> 6988.56
that you're looking at

6985.139 --> 6991.9800000000005
the actual communication that was

6988.56 --> 6995.76
attempted to be conveyed within the

6991.98 --> 6998.459999999999
scene or the description of something

6995.76 --> 7001.280000000001
like what is the deeper meaning behind

6998.46 --> 7003.9800000000005
it that's basically esoterism what's the

7001.28 --> 7006.139
deeper meaning behind it now of course

7003.98 --> 7008.119
when you're not all too familiar with

7006.139 --> 7011.719
doing that sort of thing

7008.119 --> 7013.96
it's very easy for a blabbler or a

7011.719 --> 7017.42
Grappler to just say I'm going to

7013.96 --> 7019.46
exoterically explain this and then just

7017.42 --> 7023.06
make up some [ __ ]

7019.46 --> 7025.699
and people that don't really know

7023.06 --> 7027.619000000001
how to do it they might buy into that

7025.699 --> 7030.739
and then just have that specific

7027.619 --> 7033.139
interpretation and grain as being the

7030.739 --> 7036.098999999999
esoteric explanation

7033.139 --> 7039.139
well by doing that you're actually

7036.099 --> 7042.4400000000005
latching onto the esoterism in an

7039.139 --> 7044.96
exoteric sense and that is conflicting

7042.44 --> 7047.659
and that way you don't get the essence

7044.96 --> 7051.099
you don't get the esoteric core the

7047.659 --> 7056.119
message the deeper message the message

7051.099 --> 7058.82
that Echoes on from every perspective

7056.119 --> 7062.719
right and that's what true esoterrorism

7058.82 --> 7065.36
is about it's what does this mean that

7062.719 --> 7068.719
no matter where we are at in our lives

7065.36 --> 7071.48
or in the world when you look at it

7068.719 --> 7073.159
you know everything it implies you know

7071.48 --> 7076.5199999999995
everything it means the natural

7073.159 --> 7079.5199999999995
consequences that flow forth from the

7076.52 --> 7083.360000000001
essential message that something

7079.52 --> 7086.139
contains right that's true esoterism and

7083.36 --> 7086.139
that's what I do

7097.4 --> 7103.04
we are five dinner guests okay

7100.52 --> 7105.02
are you a 10th Man on there

7103.04 --> 7107.56
okay

7105.02 --> 7107.56
fine

7111.44 --> 7116.178999999999
that's certainly a mixed Club pocano

7120.139 --> 7125.3
yes you're welcome Sterling 8012. it's

7122.659 --> 7127.78
it's a work it was a worthy question

7125.3 --> 7127.78
right

7128.0 --> 7133.28
esoterics

7130.599 --> 7136.34
is complicated

7133.28 --> 7141.259999999999
and it's kind of the point the point is

7136.34 --> 7144.26
through esoterrorism to Great to gain a

7141.26 --> 7148.820000000001
fractal grasp

7144.26 --> 7152.780000000001
on just reality itself on the design of

7148.82 --> 7156.0199999999995
the Creator and how things and meanings

7152.78 --> 7159.0199999999995
and reactions all fit together in a

7156.02 --> 7162.639
giant pattern a virtual pattern that we

7159.02 --> 7162.639
can recreate in our minds

7167.54 --> 7173.9
and to also correct things when we

7171.199 --> 7175.879999999999
detect that our interpretation is

7173.9 --> 7179.0599999999995
lacking is leaving something out or is

7175.88 --> 7180.8
incomplete then the entire thing must

7179.06 --> 7185.619000000001
