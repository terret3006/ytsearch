yeah on the other side

144.64 --> 147.76
they didn't fill in the gap yet so there

146.879 --> 150.879
was like a

147.76 --> 153.84
a pitfall of literally

150.879 --> 155.2
two meters and then i like had to climb

153.84 --> 158.48
down on my bike

155.2 --> 160.07999999999998
to cross it but yeah that bridge is

158.48 --> 162.0

308.24 --> 312.96000000000004
yourself so i know i'm not just

310.479 --> 314.479
alone here and i i don't know i've been

312.96 --> 317.35999999999996
caught off by the internet that

314.479 --> 319.36
literally people can't even see

317.36 --> 322.47900000000004
my live stream it's good to know

319.36 --> 322.47900000000004
somebody's actually watching

323.039 --> 331.36
right yes george sanford plunder23

326.56 --> 334.96
it's good yeah i got up very late

331.36 --> 338.47900000000004
i i put my alarm clock thank god i did

334.96 --> 343.039
but still like i was like damn dude i

338.479 --> 345.12
i'm i should not go to bed that late

343.039 --> 347.919
like it's not gonna kill me but i just

345.12 --> 347.919
feel like ugh

348.08 --> 351.52
i need more sleep but it was worth it

351.039 --> 355.84
still

351.52 --> 359.039
because yeah i had a uh altogether

355.84 --> 362.31899999999996
four and a half hour skype call

359.039 --> 366.08
with my friend samson yesterday

362.319 --> 367.84000000000003
talking about a lot a whole lot of

366.08 --> 371.12
things

367.84 --> 374.479
lots of personal things also basically

371.12 --> 378.16
our background and comparing

374.479 --> 378.15999999999997
well yeah comparing tragedies

379.44 --> 384.16
like showed pictures of

382.56 --> 386.24
my ex-girlfriend that sort of thing you

384.16 --> 388.88000000000005
know samson samson's growing really

386.24 --> 391.36
close to my heart

388.88 --> 393.84
and yeah he needed the time he needed my

391.36 --> 396.0
time and i needed to give it to him

393.84 --> 398.23999999999995
because he is really a loner he's so

396.0 --> 400.319
much of a loner that

398.24 --> 402.319
sometimes he doesn't really even show up

400.319 --> 406.47900000000004
in chat that much

402.319 --> 410.24
because when he kind of feels

406.479 --> 412.479
a little less than he retracts and just

410.24 --> 413.919
completely retracts like literally

412.479 --> 416.31899999999996
almost puts himself in

413.919 --> 419.12
isolated prison even from media and

416.319 --> 423.36
television everything

419.12 --> 425.52
but he had to protect his mind

423.36 --> 427.28000000000003
but at the same time he really does need

425.52 --> 430.96
like personal attention

427.28 --> 432.88
just as much as i would you know so

430.96 --> 435.039
i was glad to be able to give it to him

432.88 --> 436.88
and just also share some music

435.039 --> 438.56
some of the music that i listened and

436.88 --> 439.199
tried to figure out like do you like

438.56 --> 442.479
this

439.199 --> 445.599
this is like really new gen

442.479 --> 447.44
like techno trance style dubstep

445.599 --> 449.52
like what do you think about that

447.44 --> 451.039
because yeah what does a 50 year old guy

449.52 --> 453.52
think about that you know this could be

451.039 --> 456.0
anything but he actually appreciated

453.52 --> 457.28
it and yeah we just had a good time

456.0 --> 460.08
together yesterday but

457.28 --> 460.479
yeah this kept us up kept me up until

460.08 --> 464.56
after

460.479 --> 468.639
six o'clock

464.56 --> 471.599
all right so hey aramis standstone

468.639 --> 473.759
robin stanley good to see you a random

471.599 --> 475.599
explorer

473.759 --> 477.36
just making coffee all right well take

475.599 --> 479.199
your time at least i know there's people

477.36 --> 480.879
here now

479.199 --> 483.68
that i'm not cut off from the internet

480.879 --> 483.68
or something weird

485.919 --> 489.19899999999996
i got coffee myself

491.28 --> 495.19899999999996
or i used to until i all drank it

498.879 --> 507.84000000000003
and i got some green tea freshly made

508.6 --> 511.939
[Music]

518.839 --> 521.839
um

533.519 --> 541.04
some people can do alone very well right

537.279 --> 543.12
but it's very well

541.04 --> 546.16
it's just their way of basically

543.12 --> 548.88
restoring themselves

546.16 --> 550.64
i i've had it too it's just that i've

548.88 --> 552.56
been through a lot of things and i've

550.64 --> 555.68
went through like phase changes so i'm

552.56 --> 557.5189999999999
i've become a much more extrovert person

555.68 --> 560.4799999999999
which was always a part of me it was

557.519 --> 563.44
just kind of turned off

560.48 --> 564.24
and i was mostly introvert kind of

563.44 --> 566.6400000000001
similar but

564.24 --> 568.32
now since the the radical transformation

566.64 --> 571.4399999999999
a few weeks ago

568.32 --> 574.72
suddenly like our win full force

571.44 --> 576.5600000000001
and with it the extrovert element like

574.72 --> 578.64
it's it's like a different setting it

576.56 --> 581.4399999999999
literally is it's weird

578.64 --> 582.3199999999999
so now i can't actually handle alone

581.44 --> 585.44
that well

582.32 --> 585.44
so i seek out people

585.6 --> 591.839
to yeah to basically share my close

589.12 --> 591.839
feelings to

592.56 --> 599.1999999999999
you know that write poetry

596.64 --> 601.04
that's cool well you'd like center

599.2 --> 602.72
classes then

601.04 --> 605.8389999999999
because the real center class and

602.72 --> 609.12
tradition is all about poetry

605.839 --> 612.0790000000001
making poetry about your family

609.12 --> 613.839
and just playfully like try to criticize

612.079 --> 615.4399999999999
them or point something out point out

613.839 --> 617.2790000000001
the quality

615.44 --> 618.72
bringing in the vernacular that comes

617.279 --> 620.56
with the sinter classic

618.72 --> 622.48
tradition like all the things that are

620.56 --> 624.399
involved in that and then be creative

622.48 --> 627.12
and that's what it was always was about

624.399 --> 627.839
for my family at least of course it's a

627.12 --> 630.079
little kid's

627.839 --> 631.7600000000001
presence present presence presence and

630.079 --> 633.1999999999999
freaking poetry for the

631.76 --> 634.48
blah blah blah blah blah you have to

633.2 --> 638.399
read it because it makes them really

634.48 --> 638.399
happy i don't care give me my present

638.64 --> 642.399
right give me the legos right now damn

641.76 --> 644.16
it

642.399 --> 647.2
give me that freaking nintendo game

644.16 --> 651.279
right now me

647.2 --> 654.0790000000001
kids will be kids but uh

651.279 --> 656.24
yeah later we figure out that yeah it's

654.079 --> 658.56
really all about that poetry

656.24 --> 661.2
especially my mother cared a lot about

658.56 --> 664.3199999999999
that she was always like very devout

661.2 --> 668.1600000000001
spent months ahead of time just

664.32 --> 670.6400000000001
writing like this epos of a a poem

668.16 --> 672.0
to somebody and eventually i would kind

670.64 --> 674.16
of do the same thing too

672.0 --> 676.959
but in my own style because i've always

674.16 --> 680.3199999999999
been much more short worded so i would

676.959 --> 683.1199999999999
make very short concise

680.32 --> 684.0790000000001
poems that were quickly read but would

683.12 --> 686.24
make an impact

684.079 --> 687.5999999999999
and that that's became my thing because

686.24 --> 690.5600000000001
i didn't like just

687.6 --> 690.5600000000001
giant pages

695.36 --> 698.399
oh it rhymes no no i would be like blah

697.76 --> 699.8389999999999
blah blah

698.399 --> 702.0
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah

699.839 --> 704.72
it rhymes

702.0 --> 706.24
blah blah blah blah it rhymes it rhymes

704.72 --> 708.399
at the first two

706.24 --> 711.12
and that's like quick quick quick

708.399 --> 713.76
rhyming that was always my style

711.12 --> 716.48
no blah blah blah blah blah until

713.76 --> 717.04
everybody just falls asleep i hate that

716.48 --> 720.24
stuff

717.04 --> 730.24
but my mother loved it and yeah

720.24 --> 734.8
that was her thing

730.24 --> 737.44
the temple of heaven green tea or

734.8 --> 737.4399999999999
i don't know

740.72 --> 743.95
uh that's a really weird question

742.959 --> 747.6199999999999
blender 23

743.95 --> 747.62
[Laughter]

753.12 --> 761.12
all right so yeah

756.399 --> 762.959
yesterday pretty awesome today overall

761.12 --> 765.2
the flat earth bit of what i'm saying

762.959 --> 766.8
the flat earth early bird show was

765.2 --> 770.0790000000001
probably one of the most epic shows i've

766.8 --> 772.8
ever done three hours straight

770.079 --> 775.04
and intense from the beginning to the

772.8 --> 777.3599999999999
end i have not watched it back

775.04 --> 780.399
it's three hours you know damn it it's

777.36 --> 780.399
three freaking hours

781.12 --> 787.839
uh but i know it was good and i know i

783.92 --> 787.8389999999999
put down some really

788.24 --> 793.6
i wouldn't say hardcore just core stuff

791.04 --> 795.8389999999999
like really core really crystal clear

793.6 --> 798.0
i put down some multi-dimensional

795.839 --> 799.839
psychological experiments

798.0 --> 801.839
where i would basically say things that

799.839 --> 804.0790000000001
could be interpreted in multiple ways

801.839 --> 806.48
and no matter where you are

804.079 --> 807.4399999999999
if you're in a certain position you're

806.48 --> 809.839
listening to that

807.44 --> 810.8000000000001
it would work it's like a mechanism like

809.839 --> 813.6
a stair

810.8 --> 814.0
step stepping stone that could work in

813.6 --> 816.0
several

814.0 --> 818.639
situations and that's exactly how i

816.0 --> 821.68
meant it it's like

818.639 --> 822.5600000000001
how can i say something that maybe a

821.68 --> 824.959
year later

822.56 --> 825.92
somebody will watch that and will

824.959 --> 828.7199999999999
literally feel

825.92 --> 829.199
like i am talking to them specifically

828.72 --> 831.0400000000001
them

829.199 --> 832.8
right then at that time and it would

831.04 --> 835.8389999999999
work out

832.8 --> 836.8
how do you speak interdimensionally and

835.839 --> 840.48
that's really

836.8 --> 841.92
what a lot of yesterday's show was about

840.48 --> 845.04
that was what i was doing had

841.92 --> 847.279
so much power so much grip i was like i

845.04 --> 850.88
am going to put down things

847.279 --> 853.12
that will be watched back and it will be

850.88 --> 855.36
like it's right there right now when you

853.12 --> 859.44
watch it

855.36 --> 859.44
and yeah i hope that came across

859.76 --> 863.04
also yeah i remember i spent a lot of

861.519 --> 864.9590000000001
time on that analysis

863.04 --> 867.36
and i also like that i really liked the

864.959 --> 871.4399999999999
interaction with you guys i was

867.36 --> 874.48
pleasantly surprised how well behaved

871.44 --> 876.8000000000001
how disciplined you guys are and

874.48 --> 878.16
really worked with that in the chat very

876.8 --> 884.16
quickly i loved that

878.16 --> 886.24
it was great it's a great experience

884.16 --> 887.76
all right and after that somewhere owen

886.24 --> 892.5600000000001
benjamin

887.76 --> 895.68
big bear was live again showing off his

892.56 --> 899.5999999999999
skiing skills his energy from that

895.68 --> 901.04
and his family and yeah the usual good

899.6 --> 902.88
stuff i think there was some new

901.04 --> 905.68
mountain bear

902.88 --> 906.72
oh wait no no it was a it was like a

905.68 --> 909.92
summary

906.72 --> 914.0
somebody made like a music video summary

909.92 --> 916.7199999999999
of of like a lot of the different clips

914.0 --> 919.12
like all the the weird sayings that came

916.72 --> 922.399
out of owen benjamin over the years

919.12 --> 923.6
like all like and then like snippets

922.399 --> 926.8
from mountain bear

923.6 --> 929.6
and red pill roosters

926.8 --> 932.16
quick snippets succinctly and then with

929.6 --> 935.1990000000001
music over was really impressive

932.16 --> 938.399
like all the sayings the typical silly

935.199 --> 940.0
but very true sayings all like all

938.399 --> 943.759
stamped into a single song

940.0 --> 947.279
pretty awesome yeah montage

943.759 --> 950.32
great stuff like it's so special

947.279 --> 951.12
like how much impact just that makes it

950.32 --> 953.759
it just shows

951.12 --> 954.24
yeah this is not just a song it's like

953.759 --> 957.839
it's

954.24 --> 960.32
it's like a condensed library of meaning

957.839 --> 962.0790000000001
put into a single song almost like an

960.32 --> 965.0400000000001
oral tradition

962.079 --> 966.7199999999999
passing on of ancient information like

965.04 --> 969.5999999999999
like ancient bards

966.72 --> 971.6800000000001
did you know ancient parts there was no

969.6 --> 975.0400000000001
writing there was no reading and writing

971.68 --> 976.4799999999999
it was all oral tradition and putting

975.04 --> 979.36
stuff together

976.48 --> 982.88
in a poetic fashion perhaps like this is

979.36 --> 984.9590000000001
exactly how they did that and it's just

982.88 --> 986.48
super if you know what it is then it's

984.959 --> 989.3599999999999
like whoa

986.48 --> 991.36
dude that's like so much information in

989.36 --> 994.0790000000001
one little silly song it's

991.36 --> 994.88
brilliant if you don't know it it's like

994.079 --> 997.199
okay

994.88 --> 998.32
whatever sounds kind of funny don't get

997.199 --> 1001.519
it

998.32 --> 1004.639
and that's how that works very

1001.519 --> 1006.88
awesome also he played back one of his

1004.639 --> 1009.759
older videos

1006.88 --> 1010.0
like that is just gonna say something

1009.759 --> 1012.24
very

1010.0 --> 1014.399
odd to a lot of people here but that's

1012.24 --> 1017.759
like delightfully

1014.399 --> 1021.44
straightforward sexist but like

1017.759 --> 1024.48
justified as in

1021.44 --> 1026.72
get god get a baby and shove it

1024.48 --> 1029.039
shove it shove it it's it's like one of

1026.72 --> 1031.3600000000001
his most controversial

1029.039 --> 1033.199
things that he really got a lot of flack

1031.36 --> 1036.559
for back then

1033.199 --> 1037.6000000000001
and that just still stands and like that

1036.559 --> 1042.0
song is just like

1037.6 --> 1045.36
really i guess touching those

1042.0 --> 1049.28
those man levers in your head

1045.36 --> 1052.3999999999999
that's like yeah yeah damn yeah

1049.28 --> 1052.96
freaking crazy women with their sjw

1052.4 --> 1056.0
habits

1052.96 --> 1056.559
is like dude shut the [ __ ] up get it

1056.0 --> 1058.96
baby

1056.559 --> 1058.96
shove it

1059.76 --> 1063.12
so it was just good to hear that back

1061.76 --> 1066.64
sorry my ladies

1063.12 --> 1069.4399999999998
nothing personal but yeah

1066.64 --> 1072.0
you want my baby then you're gonna have

1069.44 --> 1075.52
to take that [ __ ]

1072.0 --> 1077.919
i'm the man and that's how it's gonna be

1075.52 --> 1080.16
very very old-fashioned like 200 years

1077.919 --> 1081.039
ago oh we evolved to pass this but not

1080.16 --> 1083.52
me

1081.039 --> 1086.0
you want to be with me you got to take

1083.52 --> 1086.0
the man

1086.24 --> 1090.48
we'll see who's uh who will still be

1088.4 --> 1092.16
left as candidate

1090.48 --> 1093.6
but that's a that's literally the way

1092.16 --> 1097.2
it's going to be i'm not gonna

1093.6 --> 1100.08
i'm not gonna go the [ __ ]

1097.2 --> 1103.919
feminism route with my girlfriend never

1100.08 --> 1103.9189999999999
i'm not even gonna act like that

1105.039 --> 1109.039
right okay robin stanley i'm glad you

1108.32 --> 1111.6789999999999
understand

1109.039 --> 1112.4
it is really like a man thing you know

1111.679 --> 1115.039
it's like

1112.4 --> 1117.919
really our defense of just being a

1115.039 --> 1120.72
freaking man like can we just be a man

1117.919 --> 1122.0
you know can we just be real what we

1120.72 --> 1125.039
feel how it works

1122.0 --> 1128.32
for us can we just do that please

1125.039 --> 1131.679
without being barrashed

1128.32 --> 1131.6789999999999
and that's what that song is really all

1134.84 --> 1137.84
about

1139.039 --> 1146.64
thank you robin stanley you're awesome

1144.08 --> 1147.4399999999998
right and hey if the ladies can just let

1146.64 --> 1150.64
the men be

1147.44 --> 1151.2
men then they can just be ladies you

1150.64 --> 1154.48
know

1151.2 --> 1157.8400000000001
when men actually are just

1154.48 --> 1158.4
treated with dignity as men then they

1157.84 --> 1160.559
give

1158.4 --> 1161.76
often their ladies more freedom than

1160.559 --> 1164.08
they deserve

1161.76 --> 1164.96
or that they can handle even right i am

1164.08 --> 1168.1599999999999
like that

1164.96 --> 1170.559
i'm like that i'm like with me you're

1168.16 --> 1172.88
actually recognizing me for what the

1170.559 --> 1175.6789999999999
archaic role that i have

1172.88 --> 1177.2800000000002
of being a soldier defending you and

1175.679 --> 1180.64
your honor with my life

1177.28 --> 1182.72
at all cost you accept that then i will

1180.64 --> 1185.1200000000001
treat you like a queen

1182.72 --> 1186.799
like an absolute queen on a golden

1185.12 --> 1189.6789999999999
throne

1186.799 --> 1191.039
and get probably give you more power

1189.679 --> 1195.039
than you can handle

1191.039 --> 1197.36
and that's the way it works right

1195.039 --> 1198.4
you don't need to claim all this freedom

1197.36 --> 1201.9189999999999
and equality

1198.4 --> 1204.88
to get unbelievable power

1201.919 --> 1208.3200000000002
you just need to accept the archaic role

1204.88 --> 1212.24
that was given to you by the creator

1208.32 --> 1216.799
when he yeah put a dick on you

1212.24 --> 1218.96
or the other way around that's it

1216.799 --> 1220.32
and yeah you can be in spirit whatever

1218.96 --> 1223.44
you like you want you have

1220.32 --> 1225.9189999999999
like man traits in your spirit then you

1223.44 --> 1228.64
have man traits in your spirit you have

1225.919 --> 1230.4
super feminine traits even as a guy well

1228.64 --> 1231.8400000000001
then you'll have super feminine traits

1230.4 --> 1233.2800000000002
it that doesn't really matter that

1231.84 --> 1236.1589999999999
doesn't determine what you

1233.28 --> 1237.12
are that's a mind trick that's a mind

1236.159 --> 1240.0800000000002
trick to make you

1237.12 --> 1241.76
basically yeah mutilate yourself and

1240.08 --> 1243.6789999999999
take you out of the gene pool that's the

1241.76 --> 1246.1589999999999
trick the psychological trick

1243.679 --> 1248.4
to like oh so you have a trait that

1246.159 --> 1250.72
typically associates with the other side

1248.4 --> 1251.679
then that means you're in the wrong body

1250.72 --> 1254.0
oh

1251.679 --> 1255.6000000000001
you have to be like that then right

1254.0 --> 1258.96
wrong

1255.6 --> 1262.0
wrong no it just means you

1258.96 --> 1263.52
have a trait typically associated with

1262.0 --> 1265.44
the other side

1263.52 --> 1267.12
and that you're just gonna have to learn

1265.44 --> 1269.1200000000001
to deal with that and other people will

1267.12 --> 1270.2399999999998
have to learn to deal with that with you

1269.12 --> 1272.1589999999999
and there might be people that are

1270.24 --> 1276.0
really allergic to that kind of

1272.159 --> 1277.8400000000001
thing and then you hold it back

1276.0 --> 1279.84
because it's just a part of your

1277.84 --> 1282.1589999999999
character

1279.84 --> 1282.1589999999999
anyway

1283.44 --> 1288.559
hey turret3o6 see you in drunken bullet

1289.36 --> 1292.4799999999998
dark steve 84.

1298.799 --> 1304.72
so let's see yeah

1302.08 --> 1306.6399999999999
doubt that happened and then ball

1304.72 --> 1308.559
busters there was a ball buster's life

1306.64 --> 1311.2
again information

1308.559 --> 1312.0
show about information it was pretty

1311.2 --> 1314.24
good

1312.0 --> 1315.84
i was there i was part of it i put down

1314.24 --> 1317.2
some really good sentences

1315.84 --> 1319.28
and qe like gave me all these

1317.2 --> 1322.32
compliments he's like

1319.28 --> 1325.44
who is this arwen like

1322.32 --> 1326.48
oh like that was so well said i i'm not

1325.44 --> 1328.3200000000002
used to this

1326.48 --> 1329.919
it's really i think he was probably

1328.32 --> 1333.039
joking

1329.919 --> 1335.5200000000002
giving a response to my response

1333.039 --> 1337.52
on friday on the flat earth debates

1335.52 --> 1339.36
where i said like who is this qe i don't

1337.52 --> 1340.24
understand he's this is too neutral this

1339.36 --> 1342.08
is creepy

1340.24 --> 1343.84
he probably said like who is this arwen

1342.08 --> 1346.08
you're so

1343.84 --> 1347.76
clear and clear-cut and like yeah i

1346.08 --> 1349.84
stopped drinking

1347.76 --> 1351.52
which i have by the way don't know if

1349.84 --> 1354.08
the people realize that

1351.52 --> 1354.72
that all that poo poo ha at the

1354.08 --> 1356.6399999999999
beginning i'm

1354.72 --> 1359.6000000000001
never drinking again i'll sign a

1356.64 --> 1362.72
contract i'll be assassinated

1359.6 --> 1364.8799999999999
if i ever do that again right well yeah

1362.72 --> 1365.76
that was ridiculous but i really have

1364.88 --> 1369.0390000000002
stopped drinking

1365.76 --> 1371.679
entirely and it like i had still a

1369.039 --> 1373.52
third of a bottle of wine left over

1371.679 --> 1376.72
there i put it away

1373.52 --> 1379.2
it's i'm done i'm totally done

1376.72 --> 1381.52
i've also don't no longer have the

1379.2 --> 1383.52
longing

1381.52 --> 1386.6399999999999
it's really out of my system my

1383.52 --> 1389.44
psychological system as well

1386.64 --> 1389.8400000000001
and i've kind of successfully replaced

1389.44 --> 1392.64
my

1389.84 --> 1393.84
food habits into this new thing and it's

1392.64 --> 1397.5200000000002
kind of balanced and

1393.84 --> 1397.52
it's financially balanced too

1399.6 --> 1405.6
i think i'm going to be in there more

1403.2 --> 1407.2
in the discord during a live show sure i

1405.6 --> 1409.6
remember standstone that's cool

1407.2 --> 1410.64
yeah you were on the ball busters at the

1409.6 --> 1414.8799999999999
end for a bit right

1410.64 --> 1414.88
i heard you speak it's pretty

1415.52 --> 1420.32
oh cool 23 20 nine months oh that's a

1418.96 --> 1423.52
long time

1420.32 --> 1428.32
yeah for me it's now uh

1423.52 --> 1428.32
three weeks it's a long time though for

1428.84 --> 1432.6399999999999
me

1430.48 --> 1435.279
it is a good change i know robin stanley

1432.64 --> 1438.0
because just the level that my faculties

1435.279 --> 1441.12
can reach right now is just

1438.0 --> 1444.64
like so much more

1441.12 --> 1448.08
so much more than it was like

1444.64 --> 1450.5590000000002
it is it's like i've i am complete

1448.08 --> 1452.6399999999999
and i know if i'm gonna drink alcohol

1450.559 --> 1456.48
yeah it might be enjoyable for a bit

1452.64 --> 1459.8400000000001
but then i would go back to like 75

1456.48 --> 1462.24
again i would lose that

1459.84 --> 1464.24
that glorious top layer i would lose it

1462.24 --> 1468.559
i know it would happen

1464.24 --> 1469.6
and something extraordinarily disastrous

1468.559 --> 1471.52
would have to happen

1469.6 --> 1473.9189999999999
life altering and extraordinary

1471.52 --> 1477.52
disastrous would i ever resort to

1473.919 --> 1479.279
going there again right because i'm not

1477.52 --> 1480.1589999999999
saying that it's never ever going to be

1479.279 --> 1482.96
ever again

1480.159 --> 1483.679
because circumstances kind of tend to

1482.96 --> 1486.48
change

1483.679 --> 1487.3600000000001
that sometimes but i don't foresee that

1486.48 --> 1490.159
coming anytime

1487.36 --> 1490.559
soon because i feel very strong enough

1490.159 --> 1493.1200000000001
for

1490.559 --> 1494.48
taking on any challenge conceivable any

1493.12 --> 1497.4399999999998
challenge

1494.48 --> 1499.2
world encompassing challenges in that

1497.44 --> 1502.0
world i mean

1499.2 --> 1502.48
a world full of people that oppose me

1502.0 --> 1505.919
level

1502.48 --> 1508.64
of challenge so i

1505.919 --> 1512.159
i'm done with alcohol for the time being

1508.64 --> 1512.159
and i really don't need it anymore

1512.48 --> 1518.159
all right am i drawing more nope

1516.24 --> 1520.559
not really have not really drawn

1518.159 --> 1520.5590000000002
anything

1521.36 --> 1525.36
although i do dream more clearly that's

1523.919 --> 1527.039
one of the things that i really

1525.36 --> 1528.6399999999999
starting to take notice is that my

1527.039 --> 1531.84
dreams are much more

1528.64 --> 1533.76
dark world clarity on average now since

1531.84 --> 1536.08
i stopped the drinking and that already

1533.76 --> 1540.24
started during the sickness period

1536.08 --> 1542.0
very crystal clear dreams now

1540.24 --> 1544.08
so getting that alcohol out of my system

1542.0 --> 1547.12
has kind of like

1544.08 --> 1550.8799999999999
cleared up the whole energy network

1547.12 --> 1553.76
inside of me and that's pretty special

1550.88 --> 1555.6000000000001
like i didn't realize alcohol just even

1553.76 --> 1556.0
the little amount that i take like two

1555.6 --> 1558.48
beers

1556.0 --> 1559.44
right it's like one liter of regular

1558.48 --> 1562.159
organic beer

1559.44 --> 1562.64
every day one liter like it's literally

1562.159 --> 1566.24
nothing

1562.64 --> 1570.0800000000002
literally but yet that one liter

1566.24 --> 1572.64
had so much influence it's just shocking

1570.08 --> 1574.799
how much influence not psychologically

1572.64 --> 1577.919
in the moment or like you

1574.799 --> 1581.76
hang over but just the

1577.919 --> 1583.1200000000001
metabolic and spiritual influence that

1581.76 --> 1585.44
it has

1583.12 --> 1587.76
in retrospect it's pretty astounding

1585.44 --> 1588.159
like i did not expect it to have that

1587.76 --> 1592.0
much

1588.159 --> 1592.48
influence and even as you're in it you

1592.0 --> 1594.88
don't

1592.48 --> 1595.919
notice that you don't notice what what

1594.88 --> 1598.72
is going missing

1595.919 --> 1601.8400000000001
basically it's very weird it's very

1598.72 --> 1601.84
weird to realize that

1608.559 --> 1617.039
dependency separates you from god uh

1612.88 --> 1621.44
to i i i don't know about that

1617.039 --> 1623.84
i was with god pretty much all the time

1621.44 --> 1625.76
and even the dependency i i did not

1623.84 --> 1627.279
really struggle it's just for me there

1625.76 --> 1629.52
was just a time in a day

1627.279 --> 1631.44
specific time in the day where i would

1629.52 --> 1634.6399999999999
just be like yeah

1631.44 --> 1637.44
now i want that i will just want to

1634.64 --> 1638.7990000000002
have a moment where like i could just

1637.44 --> 1642.0800000000002
let it go for a few

1638.799 --> 1644.559
moments and like feel like

1642.08 --> 1645.84
kind of sort of more dumb level fun for

1644.559 --> 1647.36
like an hour

1645.84 --> 1649.279
and then it would go away again and i

1647.36 --> 1649.9189999999999
would be fine with it and then the rest

1649.279 --> 1652.24
of the

1649.919 --> 1653.3600000000001
the second half of the day and that's

1652.24 --> 1657.36
how i did it

1653.36 --> 1657.36
but yeah that's over it's done

1658.08 --> 1663.36
i don't need it anymore right but anyway

1661.84 --> 1665.36
back to the schedule

1663.36 --> 1666.84
there was a ball busters i was on it it

1665.36 --> 1669.6789999999999
was pretty good

1666.84 --> 1671.76
and a very pleasant surprise

1669.679 --> 1672.799
very very pleasant as i discussed this

1671.76 --> 1683.84
with samson

1672.799 --> 1683.84
after that

1684.399 --> 1690.7199999999998
right that which it gets it

1687.919 --> 1691.1200000000001
got on the on the ball busters he got on

1690.72 --> 1694.84
there

1691.12 --> 1698.1589999999999
he got on there and he showed some

1694.84 --> 1700.1589999999999
very yeah he showed humility

1698.159 --> 1702.3990000000001
and some real character there really

1700.159 --> 1705.8400000000001
good character that was

1702.399 --> 1709.36
a big big surprise because i thought

1705.84 --> 1712.48
like i was like ready to

1709.36 --> 1715.6789999999999
basically take up arms

1712.48 --> 1718.88
because of certain things that were

1715.679 --> 1720.64
said during the debate and i just like

1718.88 --> 1722.64
i don't like this i don't like where

1720.64 --> 1724.7990000000002
this is going it feels like he's just

1722.64 --> 1728.0
being used as a pawn or something

1724.799 --> 1729.2
but i did not know him that well and i

1728.0 --> 1731.679
underestimated him

1729.2 --> 1734.0
i recognized i underestimated him

1731.679 --> 1736.88
because he came on the ball busters and

1734.0 --> 1738.0
basically from his own initiative

1736.88 --> 1740.48
corrected

1738.0 --> 1741.44
every mistake that he made like really

1740.48 --> 1745.1200000000001
succinctly

1741.44 --> 1748.72
it's like well whoa

1745.12 --> 1753.279
that is most impressive

1748.72 --> 1756.559
like that that changes everything

1753.279 --> 1757.679
like a lot it changes more things than

1756.559 --> 1761.12
you might realize

1757.679 --> 1764.24
because of the implications of who he is

1761.12 --> 1766.9599999999998
who he hangs with and

1764.24 --> 1768.08
what's going on in the background and he

1766.96 --> 1770.8600000000001
really

1768.08 --> 1772.24
basically opened the door and

1770.86 --> 1775.6789999999999
[Music]

1772.24 --> 1778.96
just was fully honest and very

1775.679 --> 1781.2
very wise very very wise and

1778.96 --> 1782.24
recognize the mistakes that he made and

1781.2 --> 1784.24
also just

1782.24 --> 1785.84
like the problems of the situation is

1784.24 --> 1789.84
just incredible

1785.84 --> 1792.559
like really applause worthy

1789.84 --> 1793.279
so that was very impressive and a big

1792.559 --> 1794.8799999999999
relief

1793.279 --> 1796.559
because i was thinking like oh my god

1794.88 --> 1797.3600000000001
this is going to be like a freaking flat

1796.559 --> 1799.52
earth war

1797.36 --> 1800.559
[ __ ] it's going to come out of this

1799.52 --> 1803.9189999999999
isn't it

1800.559 --> 1805.12
but no whitsid basically corrected

1803.919 --> 1808.159
himself

1805.12 --> 1812.1589999999999
and put himself on the level

1808.159 --> 1814.88
with us all pun intended

1812.159 --> 1815.6000000000001
right and so that was really good to be

1814.88 --> 1818.72
there

1815.6 --> 1820.799
and uh right

1818.72 --> 1824.159
after that i had a call with samson the

1820.799 --> 1828.32
last four and a half hours

1824.159 --> 1829.279
until i concluded like [ __ ] this i have

1828.32 --> 1832.559
to go to bed

1829.279 --> 1835.679
right now or i'm gonna be sick and

1832.559 --> 1836.0
yeah and now it's a flat earth early

1835.679 --> 1838.96
bird

1836.0 --> 1838.96
show on the sunday

1839.52 --> 1844.399
all right hello ryan arthurton good to

1842.08 --> 1844.399
see you

1847.039 --> 1852.64
keeping the door open to get enough

1848.96 --> 1852.64
fresh air it's just cold

1858.799 --> 1866.08
right so that's kind of it

1862.0 --> 1869.2
for the schedule

1866.08 --> 1869.1999999999998
or the notes that i made

1871.12 --> 1876.1589999999999
and yeah i'm well it's not due to any

1876.24 --> 1880.3990000000001
due to a lack of sleep i'm a little like

1879.12 --> 1882.32
a little groggy

1880.399 --> 1883.4399999999998
because i think until together i only

1882.32 --> 1886.799
slept like five

1883.44 --> 1888.72
hours and i can take that it's just that

1886.799 --> 1892.08
i'm not really used to it

1888.72 --> 1895.76
it's not exactly healthy

1892.08 --> 1895.76
so i'm not gonna do that more often

1896.72 --> 1900.0
my church is doing an outdoor life walk

1899.6 --> 1904.48
of

1900.0 --> 1904.48
jesus life many year tradition

1904.96 --> 1907.8400000000001

1908.72 --> 1912.0
and then tony star now i don't know who

1911.36 --> 1915.1999999999998
that is

1912.0 --> 1915.2
i don't think he's banned

1916.559 --> 1920.6399999999999
people keep on saying oh and ban this

1918.64 --> 1922.5590000000002
guy and banned this guy yesterday too

1920.64 --> 1924.96
he's like could you and ban this person

1922.559 --> 1926.0
ask and receive could you unban asking

1924.96 --> 1928.24
if i go through my list

1926.0 --> 1930.399
it's not bad it's just not bad what are

1928.24 --> 1934.559
people blabbering about being banned

1930.399 --> 1949.84
they're not banned so i don't know what

1934.559 --> 1949.84
you're talking about first for truth

1951.18 --> 1954.809
[Music]

1961.36 --> 1967.6789999999999
so guys and girls anything

1964.48 --> 1969.76
you want me to talk about or a dress

1967.679 --> 1970.72
i'm an open book right now i don't have

1969.76 --> 1977.84
a lot of

1970.72 --> 1977.84
things to basically put down

1978.0 --> 1984.399
down yeah i'm a little little flustered

1981.2 --> 1985.3600000000001
from lack of sleep but i can still have

1984.399 --> 1988.2399999999998
a

1985.36 --> 1991.84
good conversation or explain things if

1988.24 --> 1991.84
you want

1992.64 --> 1997.6000000000001
cheese is in the wood super fun okay it

1994.48 --> 1997.6
sounds interesting

2000.159 --> 2005.8400000000001
watch your video what is it about taran

2027.679 --> 2036.48
crying 20 seconds okay

2032.64 --> 2037.2
right oh dammit i shouldn't do that

2036.48 --> 2040.88
anymore

2037.2 --> 2043.519
ed ruined that like he

2040.88 --> 2044.0800000000002
that bastard stole something that i've

2043.519 --> 2049.28
done

2044.08 --> 2051.7599999999998
for like my entire life right

2049.28 --> 2053.599
you totally ruined that because it's a

2051.76 --> 2055.9190000000003
really good way to respond when

2053.599 --> 2058.639
somebody's just being stupid

2055.919 --> 2060.1589999999997
but he is stupid and he just always does

2058.639 --> 2063.2000000000003
that whenever

2060.159 --> 2065.28
just a stall just to be patronizing i

2063.2 --> 2069.04
hate add for that

2065.28 --> 2069.679
add ruin right cause it's a really good

2069.04 --> 2072.72
way

2069.679 --> 2075.919
to communicate with comedy the bastard

2072.72 --> 2078.9599999999996
ruined it with his stupidity

2075.919 --> 2083.04
i'm taking it back i have the

2078.96 --> 2086.32
right to say right

2083.04 --> 2090.159
and not be associated with ed i

2086.32 --> 2090.159
reclaim right

2090.24 --> 2098.24
you get it ed it's not yours buddy

2093.599 --> 2098.2400000000002
it's not yours to squander on your

2100.839 --> 2103.839
stupidity

2107.599 --> 2115.44
because even in dutch you say it

2111.119 --> 2115.44
like that in english get it

2115.68 --> 2121.44
we don't say yest

2118.8 --> 2123.44
which would be right in dutch and it

2121.44 --> 2126.56
makes no sense to say it like that

2123.44 --> 2129.839
not at all so we just say

2126.56 --> 2130.88
right but it is kind of like a sort of

2129.839 --> 2134.24
half mocking

2130.88 --> 2136.56
joke response like like

2134.24 --> 2145.839
i think it's stupid but i'm gonna go

2136.56 --> 2145.839
along with it anyway

2151.599 --> 2156.839
good comedy needed badly go watch your

2154.56 --> 2159.599
own benjamin it's

2156.839 --> 2161.7599999999998
excellent exhilarating every step of the

2159.599 --> 2164.4
way

2161.76 --> 2167.119
smoke and pancake okay dokey

2164.4 --> 2167.119
sledgehammer

2170.64 --> 2174.7999999999997
take it you're not smoking your pancake

2175.52 --> 2178.64
who knows maybe you are

2178.72 --> 2183.52
you do watch owen right okay

2181.76 --> 2185.28
i'm just saying like owen benjamin for

2183.52 --> 2189.2
me is like absolutely

2185.28 --> 2192.2400000000002
like the the number one source of comedy

2189.2 --> 2192.24
that echoes on

2192.88 --> 2198.88
what is the popular breakfast in the

2194.8 --> 2202.48
netherlands i have no idea

2198.88 --> 2204.8
absolutely none could be anything

2202.48 --> 2206.16
like literally anything so many

2204.8 --> 2210.32
different like

2206.16 --> 2214.64
there is no original breakfast

2210.32 --> 2218.6400000000003
i guess maybe krusk the crust

2214.64 --> 2222.48
ah you have grass or something

2218.64 --> 2223.2799999999997
uh or just like okay you just take a

2222.48 --> 2226.8
sandwich

2223.28 --> 2229.599
and you put like chocolate paste

2226.8 --> 2232.0
or strawberry jelly or something super

2229.599 --> 2235.6800000000003
basic on that and that's breakfast or

2232.0 --> 2238.96
like slices of salami or or

2235.68 --> 2241.04
ham bacon

2238.96 --> 2242.16
something like that it's just that's i

2241.04 --> 2244.16
don't know there is not

2242.16 --> 2245.44
really a typical dutch breakfast like

2244.16 --> 2247.44
that it's just

2245.44 --> 2249.68
people do whatever some people like corn

2247.44 --> 2252.2400000000002
flakes and others like

2249.68 --> 2254.24
i don't know man there's there's been

2252.24 --> 2256.8799999999997
people that like okay just fresh

2254.24 --> 2258.3999999999996
juicing in the morning i used to do that

2256.88 --> 2260.96
for my ex

2258.4 --> 2262.8
she was a dentist i would get up very

2260.96 --> 2266.56
freaking early and then just

2262.8 --> 2268.2400000000002
juice carrots and all this [ __ ] together

2266.56 --> 2269.92
and then give her that drink and that

2268.24 --> 2271.1189999999997
was her breakfast worked really well for

2269.92 --> 2273.359
her so

2271.119 --> 2275.04
yeah i don't know what there is no more

2273.359 --> 2277.92
typical

2275.04 --> 2277.92
dutch breakfast

2278.72 --> 2282.3199999999997
that i can remember maybe there used to

2281.119 --> 2284.96
be

2282.32 --> 2285.3590000000004
it's just it's all gone it's all turned

2284.96 --> 2291.2
into

2285.359 --> 2291.2
one giant metropolitan food habit system

2293.359 --> 2300.96
basic eggs and beans right okay

2297.68 --> 2304.64
right but we're never really a strong

2300.96 --> 2306.8
breakfast it's the netherlands it's like

2304.64 --> 2308.0789999999997
in uh like for example the mediterranean

2306.8 --> 2309.599
and spain

2308.079 --> 2312.96
like i've always taken notice like they

2309.599 --> 2315.3590000000004
have completely different eating habits

2312.96 --> 2317.2
they get a big breakfast then they get a

2315.359 --> 2320.24
very mild lunch

2317.2 --> 2323.2
and then they get much later a big

2320.24 --> 2324.9599999999996
dinner again and then they go to sleep

2323.2 --> 2328.0
that's how they do it

2324.96 --> 2329.92
because of these heat situation because

2328.0 --> 2330.72
in the afternoon it's always going to be

2329.92 --> 2334.4
hot

2330.72 --> 2336.16
then they have a shester sleep

2334.4 --> 2337.6800000000003
if it's really mid-summer and all that

2336.16 --> 2339.359
so you just sleep

2337.68 --> 2340.8799999999997
so you don't really eat too much and

2339.359 --> 2341.52
they never really do so they have bigger

2340.88 --> 2345.44
breakfast

2341.52 --> 2345.44
and very big dinner

2346.4 --> 2351.04
and as far as i can remember and that

2348.32 --> 2352.8
was i always associated that with spain

2351.04 --> 2354.72
in the mediterranean

2352.8 --> 2356.32
but in the netherlands it's do we don't

2354.72 --> 2360.72
have that at all

2356.32 --> 2363.3590000000004
we don't have that distinct

2360.72 --> 2365.04
daytime issues that makes you adapt your

2363.359 --> 2366.0789999999997
food habits to it we don't have that

2365.04 --> 2368.32
here so

2366.079 --> 2370.2400000000002
it's usually just standard basic

2368.32 --> 2371.2000000000003
breakfast or a lot of breakfast if you

2370.24 --> 2373.5989999999997
like that

2371.2 --> 2374.56
and then the afternoon maybe lunch some

2373.599 --> 2377.6800000000003
people may even

2374.56 --> 2379.44
sort of skip it or get some snacks and

2377.68 --> 2382.48
then just regular dinner

2379.44 --> 2385.04
usually pretty early

2382.48 --> 2386.2400000000002
and then maybe snacks again later before

2385.04 --> 2389.68
you go to bed or something

2386.24 --> 2392.8599999999997
i don't know i don't know

2389.68 --> 2392.8599999999997
[Music]

2393.119 --> 2398.4
instant globe flakes yeah but that's not

2396.4 --> 2401.76
very nutritious you know

2398.4 --> 2401.76
it's just a lot of hot air

2406.8 --> 2411.52
it's like a lot of hollow arguments it's

2409.839 --> 2414.7999999999997
not very nutritious for you

2411.52 --> 2416.16
instant glow flakes it may taste good at

2414.8 --> 2420.079
first

2416.16 --> 2423.359
but yeah it's it's not very good for you

2420.079 --> 2424.8
i would recommend a more nutritious food

2423.359 --> 2427.7599999999998
base and then maybe

2424.8 --> 2428.4
if you got room the globe flakes on the

2427.76 --> 2431.44
side

2428.4 --> 2432.079
snacks because there is infinite of

2431.44 --> 2435.68
those

2432.079 --> 2439.44
of course oh it's a joke

2435.68 --> 2442.319
oh i thought you were literal hmm

2439.44 --> 2443.52
yeah now i'm pretty sure that i was

2442.319 --> 2446.24
conveying

2443.52 --> 2448.64
that insight that it was a joke ramison

2446.24 --> 2448.64
stone

2449.52 --> 2453.839
just add maths

2459.92 --> 2463.599
that's mock math using personal

2462.96 --> 2466.4
computers

2463.599 --> 2467.119
okay how's that mocking math what what's

2466.4 --> 2470.1600000000003
mocking

2467.119 --> 2473.04
math about binary binary is just binary

2470.16 --> 2473.04
it's just a language

2475.52 --> 2483.639
don't get it

2480.36 --> 2483.639
[Music]

2487.49 --> 2490.8799999999997
[Music]

2492.839 --> 2495.839
hmm

2496.4 --> 2502.0
nutella it's mostly sugar i wouldn't

2499.76 --> 2502.0
know

2502.319 --> 2510.4
hell has a brand that i have not

2505.839 --> 2512.4
touched or even seen in a long long time

2510.4 --> 2513.599
and besides there's all kinds of brands

2512.4 --> 2516.88
of organic

2513.599 --> 2521.04
chocolate paste and like hazelnut paste

2516.88 --> 2522.96
they're awesome very much much tastier

2521.04 --> 2524.48
i even had a silly habit back in the day

2522.96 --> 2526.7200000000003
where i would just buy

2524.48 --> 2530.319
like pots of that stuff and then

2526.72 --> 2532.9599999999996
literally just slow spoon it out

2530.319 --> 2534.0
like it was liquid chocolate bar or

2532.96 --> 2537.119
something

2534.0 --> 2539.76
because those organic brands man that's

2537.119 --> 2541.6800000000003
that's a world of difference it's like

2539.76 --> 2544.2400000000002
so much better

2541.68 --> 2546.0789999999997
like so much better than just regular

2544.24 --> 2549.359
typical

2546.079 --> 2552.079
hazelnut chocolate paste

2549.359 --> 2552.48
like really you should try it sometime

2552.079 --> 2554.8
just

2552.48 --> 2556.16
get one of those awkwardly expensive

2554.8 --> 2558.5600000000004
pots

2556.16 --> 2559.2799999999997
put it together you will taste the

2558.56 --> 2565.599
difference

2559.28 --> 2569.52
big time especially afterwards

2565.599 --> 2571.839
all right anyway working computers proof

2569.52 --> 2573.92
globe didn't you know that yeah yeah i

2571.839 --> 2575.839
heard that [ __ ]

2573.92 --> 2577.599
if you're looking at a laptop right now

2575.839 --> 2578.0789999999997
then that means that the earth must be a

2577.599 --> 2581.44
globe

2578.079 --> 2581.44
right yeah

2590.0 --> 2594.16
our programming is based on math okay

2596.079 --> 2599.76
sure yeah talking about computers by the

2598.4 --> 2602.2400000000002
way

2599.76 --> 2605.0400000000004
i i had some really good sponsorship

2602.24 --> 2608.16
mostly thanks to dank yesterday

2605.04 --> 2611.2
and i did actually get something with it

2608.16 --> 2614.56
right away i got an ssd disc

2611.2 --> 2617.4399999999996
one terabyte it's four times as big as

2614.56 --> 2618.88
the one that i'm currently using still

2617.44 --> 2621.92
so i got that for

2618.88 --> 2624.079
150 euros 15

2621.92 --> 2625.04
just thought it was dirt cheap it's like

2624.079 --> 2628.7200000000003
it was

2625.04 --> 2631.7599999999998
three times less than i paid for the 250

2628.72 --> 2634.72
gigabyte ssd at the time

2631.76 --> 2635.6800000000003
so that was awesome and now i yeah i got

2634.72 --> 2639.2
space

2635.68 --> 2639.2
coming out of my ass now

2639.359 --> 2645.44
and also this lays the groundwork for me

2642.48 --> 2647.52
to be able to completely

2645.44 --> 2649.359
revamp my computer it's like the first

2647.52 --> 2651.599
stepping stone in building that new

2649.359 --> 2656.16
computer i was talking about

2651.599 --> 2656.1600000000003
so i hope i'm taking it as such

2658.8 --> 2662.48
and yeah i can definitely use of course

2660.64 --> 2664.72
more support for this

2662.48 --> 2665.68
this is just the first step it's a good

2664.72 --> 2667.2799999999997
step because

2665.68 --> 2670.16
i can get a computer together and then

2667.28 --> 2674.5600000000004
i'll put this disk in there

2670.16 --> 2676.8799999999997
and then i get two computers like that

2674.56 --> 2680.16
but yeah please keep the support coming

2676.88 --> 2680.1600000000003
i really appreciate that

2681.52 --> 2691.839
because yeah this is the one i got this

2684.319 --> 2693.839
is what i got for it

2691.839 --> 2696.0
it's exactly the same brand as the one

2693.839 --> 2696.96
that i got in the computer except it's

2696.0 --> 2701.119
the

2696.96 --> 2704.96
instead of an 850 it's an 860.

2701.119 --> 2707.359
two years old well widely tested

2704.96 --> 2709.839
very reliable exactly what i want it's

2707.359 --> 2713.839
just this thing is never gonna break

2709.839 --> 2716.0
it's gonna last my entire life probably

2713.839 --> 2717.599
oh the only problem that i'm gonna have

2716.0 --> 2720.8
is that games might

2717.599 --> 2723.28
for example become just so absurdly big

2720.8 --> 2725.599
that just no freaking disc out there is

2723.28 --> 2729.6800000000003
gonna fit it anymore

2725.599 --> 2732.96
but hey at some point guys at some point

2729.68 --> 2734.7999999999997
they might just as well switch back to

2732.96 --> 2738.599
game cartridges

2734.8 --> 2742.2400000000002
and just say okay here is a specially

2738.599 --> 2746.7200000000003
unwritable modified ssd

2742.24 --> 2749.4399999999996
of say 500 gigabytes

2746.72 --> 2750.72
that is completely filled up with this

2749.44 --> 2753.28
game that you then

2750.72 --> 2753.2799999999997
plug in

2754.079 --> 2758.319
in your docking station like this and

2757.04 --> 2760.24
then you play that game

2758.319 --> 2762.88
from the cartridge almost like the super

2760.24 --> 2765.5989999999997
nintendo remember that

2762.88 --> 2766.48
that's that would be viable at some

2765.599 --> 2769.599
point because

2766.48 --> 2773.2
yeah you don't want like

2769.599 --> 2776.079
20 terabytes worth of

2773.2 --> 2777.7599999999998
ssd disks just because you want to play

2776.079 --> 2779.52
the latest freaking game which is

2777.76 --> 2781.599
ridiculous

2779.52 --> 2788.0
the sizes that these games are becoming

2781.599 --> 2791.52
is absolutely ridiculous

2788.0 --> 2794.4
so why not just do that why not just

2791.52 --> 2795.52
instead of being at all online and blah

2794.4 --> 2799.44
blah blah

2795.52 --> 2803.92
just start selling cheap ass

2799.44 --> 2808.56
cartridge based on ssd game

2803.92 --> 2811.76
cartridges why not why not

2808.56 --> 2812.88
it would be great you don't need any

2811.76 --> 2815.44
freaking space

2812.88 --> 2816.1600000000003
on your computer you could just plug it

2815.44 --> 2820.2400000000002
in

2816.16 --> 2822.7999999999997
why not people why not why not do this

2820.24 --> 2823.7599999999998
it's so much better so much better you

2822.8 --> 2827.8390000000004
can just

2823.76 --> 2831.119
plug it out put it back in the cartridge

2827.839 --> 2832.96
thing leave it out there and then maybe

2831.119 --> 2833.52
10 years later you'll find it's like hey

2832.96 --> 2835.119
whoa i

2833.52 --> 2836.88
still got that game and you got a

2835.119 --> 2838.8
completely different computer

2836.88 --> 2841.28
and you just plug it in there you didn't

2838.8 --> 2843.599
need to make any room or anything

2841.28 --> 2845.44
and you just play that game just like

2843.599 --> 2848.4
the super nintendo it was

2845.44 --> 2850.16
the convenient part about that cartridge

2848.4 --> 2850.8
system with the super nintendo and all

2850.16 --> 2853.1189999999997
that

2850.8 --> 2854.559
that was the convenient part about it

2853.119 --> 2857.52
you just plug it in

2854.559 --> 2858.6400000000003
no nonsense and you play it we can do

2857.52 --> 2861.44
that again

2858.64 --> 2863.7599999999998
game industry you hear me game industry

2861.44 --> 2866.16
biggest multimedia industry

2863.76 --> 2867.0400000000004
in the freaking world at the moment

2866.16 --> 2869.7599999999998
hello

2867.04 --> 2872.16
can you take a hint can you take a damn

2869.76 --> 2874.48
hint and just

2872.16 --> 2875.2
do something useful with the technology

2874.48 --> 2878.319
that's here

2875.2 --> 2881.839
maybe standardized

2878.319 --> 2885.04
small sized ssd disks that you

2881.839 --> 2887.7599999999998
can rebuild specifically to become

2885.04 --> 2888.5589999999997
standardized game cartridges for really

2887.76 --> 2890.6400000000003
big games

2888.559 --> 2892.0
so people don't have to constantly buy

2890.64 --> 2893.92
new hard disks

2892.0 --> 2895.44
just to be able to play your freaking

2893.92 --> 2897.599
oversized game

2895.44 --> 2898.8
you just sell the cartridge with there

2897.599 --> 2902.559
what's it gonna be

2898.8 --> 2906.88
like 20 euros extra you could take like

2902.559 --> 2909.3590000000004
mil billions of old outdated ssd

2906.88 --> 2910.319
disc versions that are literally going

2909.359 --> 2914.0789999999997
to be thrown

2910.319 --> 2918.4
on the garbage pilot someday right

2914.079 --> 2922.4
and just take them and use them

2918.4 --> 2926.319
why not do it

2922.4 --> 2929.92
and stop being lazy parasites

2926.319 --> 2932.5589999999997
that sell games to people

2929.92 --> 2933.04
that they pay for and then it doesn't

2932.559 --> 2935.44
work

2933.04 --> 2937.04
for over a week and then when they

2935.44 --> 2939.28
complain about it tell them

2937.04 --> 2941.2
sorry corona measures this might take a

2939.28 --> 2943.2000000000003
month before we get back to you

2941.2 --> 2945.52
stop being a [ __ ] parasite and

2943.2 --> 2948.96
actually innovate for once in your damn

2945.52 --> 2948.96
lives alright

2952.4 --> 2960.319
yeah because what games do i play well

2956.72 --> 2963.1189999999997
i had downloaded bought

2960.319 --> 2964.8
basically paid for baldur's gate 3. i

2963.119 --> 2968.079
haven't played it a single time

2964.8 --> 2968.079
it doesn't start up

2972.319 --> 2976.079
freaking pissed off about i want my

2974.0 --> 2978.079
money back i want my money back

2976.079 --> 2979.599
like i will not tolerate freaking

2978.079 --> 2982.88
supposed game company

2979.599 --> 2985.92
that sells a game for 60 euros

2982.88 --> 2986.8
and you can't even freaking start the

2985.92 --> 2989.92
game

2986.8 --> 2993.04
it's unacceptable how dare you

2989.92 --> 2996.4
put this out and then freaking complain

2993.04 --> 2999.119
afterward that you can it costs months

2996.4 --> 3000.079
what before you can freaking start up

2999.119 --> 3003.599
the game

3000.079 --> 3006.8
are you out of your [ __ ] minds

3003.599 --> 3008.2400000000002
like just for that response alone the

3006.8 --> 3012.1600000000003
entire company should be

3008.24 --> 3015.2799999999997
shut down absolutely preposterous

3012.16 --> 3017.1189999999997

3020.96 --> 3024.319
what your excuses

3022.72 --> 3026.319

3024.319 --> 3029.119
to pay for a game

3026.319 --> 3030.96
that i literally can't even start up

3029.119 --> 3032.4
it's not like it's breaks

3030.96 --> 3034.0
somewhere halfway you know that would be

3032.4 --> 3038.839
a no you know i can't

3034.0 --> 3041.2
start it up it's unacceptable

3038.839 --> 3043.92
unacceptable

3041.2 --> 3045.1189999999997
no not uninstall reinstall did you know

3043.92 --> 3048.2400000000002
that that took me over

3045.119 --> 3051.2000000000003
24 hours to do

3048.24 --> 3053.2
it's just unacceptable it should not do

3051.2 --> 3056.16
that

3053.2 --> 3059.29
there's no excuse for this incompetence

3056.16 --> 3062.5
absolutely no excuse at all

3059.29 --> 3062.5
[Music]

3066.72 --> 3070.319
yeah of course my pc meets the

3068.64 --> 3072.24
requirements if it didn't i wouldn't

3070.319 --> 3075.44
even be able to install it

3072.24 --> 3075.4399999999996
what do you think come on

3078.559 --> 3083.119
have them send a disk what does that

3080.839 --> 3085.04
mean

3083.119 --> 3087.599
no it's not a download error it is

3085.04 --> 3089.119
downloaded it is fully installed on my

3087.599 --> 3092.559
computer

3089.119 --> 3096.4
and then the startup thing i click

3092.559 --> 3099.52
play and after 30 seconds oh this the

3096.4 --> 3101.359
assist the lorry launcher the thing that

3099.52 --> 3102.16
actually launches the game it broke it

3101.359 --> 3104.0789999999997
didn't work oh

3102.16 --> 3105.68
windows is going to try to find out why

3104.079 --> 3108.079
and come back at you

3105.68 --> 3109.52
yeah that's been happening for several

3108.079 --> 3111.76
days now

3109.52 --> 3114.079
yeah it's not about the installation i

3111.76 --> 3118.1600000000003
did it perfectly it's all there

3114.079 --> 3120.96
it's all updated it doesn't start up

3118.16 --> 3122.0
there's no excuse there's nothing that

3120.96 --> 3125.44
i've done

3122.0 --> 3139.839
that may have caused this this error

3125.44 --> 3139.839
did everything possible it's just broken

3140.319 --> 3146.72
no i my computer can absolutely take it

3144.24 --> 3146.72
it can

3149.76 --> 3153.28
like it's literally in the

3151.48 --> 3155.28
specifications

3153.28 --> 3156.4
yeah i read the specifications i'm not

3155.28 --> 3159.92
just gonna

3156.4 --> 3161.6800000000003
buy a game and then end up having this

3159.92 --> 3162.96
message like oh your computer doesn't

3161.68 --> 3165.2
meet the requirements

3162.96 --> 3166.8
because that's what actually happens

3165.2 --> 3168.3999999999996
when you install a game

3166.8 --> 3170.1600000000003
that your computer can't run it's going

3168.4 --> 3172.0
to tell you like

3170.16 --> 3173.68
this computer does not meet the

3172.0 --> 3175.52
requirements

3173.68 --> 3177.52
right and then often you can't even

3175.52 --> 3180.0
start it up but it will say that

3177.52 --> 3182.559
it didn't say that no i do meet your

3180.0 --> 3184.0
requirements absolutely i do by a wide

3182.559 --> 3188.079
margin

3184.0 --> 3190.72
it just doesn't work do you get it

3188.079 --> 3193.28
you want to make sure more excuses for a

3190.72 --> 3197.2799999999997
company that you're not even a part of

3193.28 --> 3197.28
that is mucked up terribly

3202.4 --> 3206.839
well i've had one i've had game tell me

3204.72 --> 3209.839
that i didn't meet the system

3206.839 --> 3209.839
requirements

3210.64 --> 3215.68
when i like tried to get a

3213.68 --> 3217.52
relatively new game on an older computer

3215.68 --> 3220.96
yeah it would definitely tell me like

3217.52 --> 3224.0
this doesn't work computer doesn't

3220.96 --> 3227.28
comply to what's required

3224.0 --> 3229.04
literally so yeah it does

3227.28 --> 3230.3190000000004
but hey if you never experienced that's

3229.04 --> 3233.2
fine it's

3230.319 --> 3233.2
you are not me

3235.44 --> 3240.319
now i'm not going to freaking spend

3237.599 --> 3243.119
another 24 hours reinstalling that [ __ ]

3240.319 --> 3245.119
it is installed has nothing to do with

3243.119 --> 3247.839
the installation

3245.119 --> 3249.76
it is installed exactly as is and they

3247.839 --> 3251.2799999999997
gave me a response like yeah we are

3249.76 --> 3253.2000000000003
getting snowed in

3251.28 --> 3254.7200000000003
from complaints that we can't address

3253.2 --> 3258.16
because of corona blah blah blah

3254.72 --> 3260.16
so they just handed out a broken system

3258.16 --> 3262.16
it's probably like a huge amount of

3260.16 --> 3264.72
people that literally are like me

3262.16 --> 3265.2799999999997
sitting here being super frustrated like

3264.72 --> 3267.68
yeah

3265.28 --> 3268.3190000000004
i've been given a broken game it doesn't

3267.68 --> 3270.0
work

3268.319 --> 3271.359
and they're not helping me nobody's

3270.0 --> 3273.04
doing anything about there's no new

3271.359 --> 3275.7599999999998
updates to fix this

3273.04 --> 3276.5589999999997
immediately it's just sitting there so

3275.76 --> 3279.44
the company

3276.559 --> 3280.88
is basically just i don't know what

3279.44 --> 3282.64
they're doing like the people that are

3280.88 --> 3286.799
in this company either don't know what

3282.64 --> 3288.4
they're doing or they literally just ran

3286.799 --> 3290.72
it could be that some of the people that

3288.4 --> 3294.559
were supposed to do and fix this thing

3290.72 --> 3296.799
literally just took their stuff and ran

3294.559 --> 3300.079
build could be that that's going on

3296.799 --> 3300.079
right now i don't know

3300.48 --> 3306.16
oh really eric parker well in that case

3303.44 --> 3309.44
you're getting a timeout

3306.16 --> 3314.319
piss off dude don't you [ __ ] tell me

3309.44 --> 3316.7200000000003
it's my freaking fault yeah [ __ ] off

3314.319 --> 3318.079
i mean it [ __ ] off who the [ __ ] do you

3316.72 --> 3321.4399999999996
think you are telling me

3318.079 --> 3323.2000000000003
it's on my end [ __ ] i paid 60 euros i

3321.44 --> 3326.319
did exactly everything it should be

3323.2 --> 3330.0
i double checked everything

3326.319 --> 3333.2
and it's broken it's just broken

3330.0 --> 3334.079
you get it it's broken and i'm getting

3333.2 --> 3335.9199999999996
my money back

3334.079 --> 3339.119
you don't like it well go [ __ ] yourself

3335.92 --> 3341.44
then i did not do anything wrong

3339.119 --> 3342.559
it's correctly installed there's no

3341.44 --> 3346.2400000000002
errors

3342.559 --> 3349.6800000000003
i'm not gonna do anything because you

3346.24 --> 3351.7599999999998
think i didn't do it right [ __ ]

3349.68 --> 3353.7599999999998
why don't you go buy the [ __ ] game

3351.76 --> 3355.92
and install it and see if it works

3353.76 --> 3358.1600000000003
oh you think you can you think you can

3355.92 --> 3361.359
stay okay now you're banned

3358.16 --> 3362.16
you're banned with all accounts never

3361.359 --> 3376.24
come back again

3362.16 --> 3377.44
piece of [ __ ] go [ __ ] yourself yeah

3376.24 --> 3378.799
maybe you should have thought of that

3377.44 --> 3382.16
before you

3378.799 --> 3384.079
smartmouth me huh

3382.16 --> 3385.5989999999997
maybe you think should think about what

3384.079 --> 3387.52
the [ __ ] coming out of your mouth and

3385.599 --> 3391.839
onto the keyboard

3387.52 --> 3391.839
before you [ __ ] mouth me right

3403.2 --> 3411.1189999999997
run admin install with compatible wizard

3407.839 --> 3411.92
well i always run as admin i am the

3411.119 --> 3416.4
admin

3411.92 --> 3418.88
i have full admin capabilities and

3416.4 --> 3419.599
usually i can't even install anything

3418.88 --> 3422.7200000000003
unless i

3419.599 --> 3425.92
invoke the admin function during that

3422.72 --> 3425.9199999999996
so it's already done

3428.559 --> 3433.8390000000004
we're talking about baldur's gate 3.

3435.52 --> 3442.079
came out recently i think a

3438.72 --> 3442.0789999999997
month couple of months ago

3445.76 --> 3451.3590000000004
and i bought it through the gog company

3449.68 --> 3452.8799999999997
it's a big regret i should have probably

3451.359 --> 3454.88
gotten it on steam

3452.88 --> 3457.28
because steam is a longer standing

3454.88 --> 3460.48
company i just thought let's sponsor the

3457.28 --> 3463.28
the small guy oh there we go bad mistake

3460.48 --> 3464.4
on my part and so i want my money back

3463.28 --> 3475.8390000000004
because the company is an

3464.4 --> 3475.839
utter failure utter failure

3477.2 --> 3480.64
and they they're not the guys by the way

3478.799 --> 3483.28
that programmed the game

3480.64 --> 3484.24
they're just a company that provide a

3483.28 --> 3487.3590000000004
platform

3484.24 --> 3488.319
for the game to play on you see that's

3487.359 --> 3490.64
the difference

3488.319 --> 3492.48
so they didn't even make the game

3490.64 --> 3496.24
they're just the providers and they

3492.48 --> 3496.2400000000002
failed miserably

3498.319 --> 3504.96
and i want my money back

3502.88 --> 3507.28
polish gate now there's a game yeah i

3504.96 --> 3508.16
know plunder 23 that's why i bought it i

3507.28 --> 3510.079
i don't even

3508.16 --> 3511.2799999999997
bother these guys playing games or

3510.079 --> 3514.319
buying games anymore

3511.28 --> 3516.2400000000002
i might download it and try it out but

3514.319 --> 3518.319
yeah baldur's gate i consider

3516.24 --> 3520.0789999999997
while there's gate one and two the best

3518.319 --> 3522.799
games ever made

3520.079 --> 3524.6400000000003
on average like it's then that's a

3522.799 --> 3526.48
long-term decision like

3524.64 --> 3528.16
after everything is over everything is

3526.48 --> 3530.16
done everything is built

3528.16 --> 3531.44
they will probably be the best games

3530.16 --> 3533.68
ever made

3531.44 --> 3534.799
because they are eternal they are like a

3533.68 --> 3537.44
good book that just

3534.799 --> 3540.799
never falters the story is always good

3537.44 --> 3540.799
the music is always good

3541.68 --> 3545.839
the voice acting is absolutely brilliant

3546.0 --> 3550.64
and the story is just rich on us on a

3548.72 --> 3551.7599999999998
psychological and spiritual level that

3550.64 --> 3553.5989999999997
is unparalleled

3551.76 --> 3554.7990000000004
it's really unparalleled and it's not

3553.599 --> 3558.319
[ __ ] dark

3554.799 --> 3558.799
it's just real it's real [ __ ] not like

3558.319 --> 3561.599
ooh

3558.799 --> 3564.64
spooky gothic [ __ ] no no it's just real

3561.599 --> 3568.079
real darkness real light for real

3564.64 --> 3573.839
in the dnd setting very serious very

3568.079 --> 3573.8390000000004
very incredibly serious and i love that

3576.88 --> 3582.559
right yeah big fan of baldur's gate i

3579.92 --> 3584.559
basically even made a remark about that

3582.559 --> 3588.3190000000004
on my website

3584.559 --> 3592.96
the trolls and tyrants website

3588.319 --> 3596.839
i'll share that where i put down

3592.96 --> 3599.28
my my dnd version

3596.839 --> 3603.44
3.87 or

3599.28 --> 3607.76
square root of 15 dnd square root 15

3603.44 --> 3610.319
which is my version of dnd

3607.76 --> 3611.6800000000003
and in the intro page yeah it's the

3610.319 --> 3612.839
first thing i talk about it's freaking

3611.68 --> 3615.7599999999998
balder's gate

3612.839 --> 3617.44
1998. baldur's gate that's really what

3615.76 --> 3619.76
made me do this

3617.44 --> 3622.799
what made me like a permanent fan of the

3619.76 --> 3622.7990000000004
dnd franchise

3622.96 --> 3628.079
so this is my website and on this

3625.28 --> 3631.44
website you can find my

3628.079 --> 3631.44
public domain

3631.52 --> 3638.96
yeah dnd versions

3634.72 --> 3641.1189999999997
an update to the dnd 3.5 system

3638.96 --> 3642.319
my update because there is also

3641.119 --> 3645.2000000000003
pathfinder which

3642.319 --> 3646.72
did its own kind of thing and it even

3645.2 --> 3649.52
though it works fine

3646.72 --> 3651.2799999999997
screw that a mine is better like a

3649.52 --> 3653.52
hundred times better

3651.28 --> 3654.96
now of course the dnd world has moved on

3653.52 --> 3657.119
to dnd4

3654.96 --> 3658.799
and in e5 and who knows where is it

3657.119 --> 3659.44
going to go it's all completely

3658.799 --> 3663.599
different

3659.44 --> 3666.0
yeah mine is the three series

3663.599 --> 3666.7200000000003
in the utter perfection that's what it

3666.0 --> 3668.88
is

3666.72 --> 3670.319
i perfected the three system the most

3668.88 --> 3673.359
extensive game

3670.319 --> 3674.16
mechanism system probably ever created

3673.359 --> 3677.2799999999997
in the world

3674.16 --> 3680.64
the most extensive system for a game

3677.28 --> 3680.96
ever created in the world the biggest

3680.64 --> 3684.8799999999997
one

3680.96 --> 3686.88
ever devised and i perfected it

3684.88 --> 3689.359
because i'm a freaking wizard and i

3686.88 --> 3692.799
spent 10 years over

3689.359 --> 3697.68
20 000 hours tinkering this stuff 20

3692.799 --> 3699.68
000 hours tinkering the rules

3697.68 --> 3702.8799999999997
and the results of that are on my trolls

3699.68 --> 3704.799
and tyrants wordpress site

3702.88 --> 3706.48
although not all the files can download

3704.799 --> 3708.24
properly anymore because i didn't pay

3706.48 --> 3709.839
them money so now they are basically

3708.24 --> 3711.7599999999998
letting my files break

3709.839 --> 3714.48
but i still have the files on my

3711.76 --> 3717.119
computer and i will hand them over

3714.48 --> 3718.079
just like that to anybody who wants

3717.119 --> 3721.52
because they are free

3718.079 --> 3721.52
i made them for the world

3721.92 --> 3726.0
i yeah and i have to because it is all

3724.16 --> 3729.359
based on open license

3726.0 --> 3731.599
so the files are open license

3729.359 --> 3734.4
the pdf files at the bottom all of them

3731.599 --> 3738.2400000000002
have open license agreements

3734.4 --> 3741.28
so that yeah this cannot be

3738.24 --> 3744.3999999999996
profiteered off of you can use it

3741.28 --> 3747.6800000000003
you can honor me you can even use it as

3744.4 --> 3751.039
an inspiration for your own game design

3747.68 --> 3753.839
but it is what it is it's mine

3751.039 --> 3754.3190000000004
i made it and everybody can use it and

3753.839 --> 3758.16
that's

3754.319 --> 3758.16
how i what i decided to do with that

3759.599 --> 3764.079
would you say baldur's gate 3 on a pc

3762.48 --> 3767.44
place like an early place i don't know

3764.079 --> 3769.2000000000003
i've never had a playstation

3767.44 --> 3771.68
certainly haven't played those games on

3769.2 --> 3774.72
the playstation at all i have no idea

3771.68 --> 3774.72
plunder 23.

3775.92 --> 3778.799
no idea at all

3779.92 --> 3785.2000000000003
you know it's this it's so very cute

3783.039 --> 3787.039
i have not played the game yet i have

3785.2 --> 3787.68
not been able to start it up yet i don't

3787.039 --> 3790.48
know

3787.68 --> 3797.359
it's broken i'm pissed off i want my

3790.48 --> 3802.0
money back

3797.359 --> 3802.0
good info on my link to fix your game

3803.839 --> 3811.839
larian.com hey hey

3808.839 --> 3811.839
that's

3817.039 --> 3821.28
shutting down non-essentially firewalls

3819.28 --> 3824.48
cause conflict there's no firewalls i

3821.28 --> 3826.799
don't have a firewall

3824.48 --> 3826.799
okay

3828.319 --> 3830.64
wow

3832.24 --> 3839.839
all right i did not know that

3840.96 --> 3846.4
directx 11 rather than vulcan i don't

3843.68 --> 3850.24
even know what that is

3846.4 --> 3851.599
launch settings launcher settings is

3850.24 --> 3853.839
that what is their launches

3851.599 --> 3853.839
what

3855.68 --> 3859.52
okay well this is in a very extensive

3857.68 --> 3862.319
page there

3859.52 --> 3866.079
i will i guess i will try this out it's

3862.319 --> 3868.4
better than just nothing

3866.079 --> 3870.2400000000002
although yeah still i still find it kind

3868.4 --> 3872.0
of ridiculous that i would have to go

3870.24 --> 3874.4799999999996
through all these hoops just to get the

3872.0 --> 3876.64
game to start up properly

3874.48 --> 3877.599
and that they wouldn't that even the

3876.64 --> 3880.16
like the people

3877.599 --> 3881.52
that you go to report things to that

3880.16 --> 3884.0789999999997
they didn't directly

3881.52 --> 3886.72
link me up to this then that had to get

3884.079 --> 3886.7200000000003
it through you

3887.119 --> 3895.839
but yeah thanks

3896.64 --> 3909.839
pdp directx versions from

3910.88 --> 3914.4
maybe i'll need some assistance with

3920.839 --> 3923.839
that

3931.44 --> 3935.599
all right so i'm gonna unban eric parker

3934.079 --> 3938.559
now

3935.599 --> 3940.7200000000003
even though he was a complete dick at

3938.559 --> 3943.28
the time

3940.72 --> 3946.24
somehow managed to not address me with

3943.28 --> 3946.2400000000002
the proper respect

3947.28 --> 3950.48
but i guess that maybe had a point even

3949.76 --> 3953.039
though he

3950.48 --> 3954.0
didn't really use it to help me out

3953.039 --> 3956.4
rather

3954.0 --> 3957.44
point out how supposedly incompetent i

3956.4 --> 3959.44
am right

3957.44 --> 3960.96
complaining about that so many people

3959.44 --> 3964.799
are complaining about this

3960.96 --> 3968.2400000000002
you know the thing is i'm a consumer

3964.799 --> 3968.72
i gave money to play a game i should not

3968.24 --> 3971.3999999999996
be

3968.72 --> 3972.8799999999997
i shouldn't be forced to be a freaking

3971.4 --> 3976.839
programmer

3972.88 --> 3979.839
just to start up an amusement

3976.839 --> 3982.4
product that i bought money for you get

3979.839 --> 3984.0
don't come back with your freaking sock

3982.4 --> 3987.2000000000003
accounts buddy

3984.0 --> 3993.68
i unbanned eric parker one

3987.2 --> 3996.319
don't do that again

3993.68 --> 3999.2799999999997
yeah and all you said is that yeah yeah

3996.319 --> 3999.2799999999997
it's a little too much

4000.64 --> 4004.5589999999997
yeah it's a little too much i was given

4003.359 --> 4006.96
a product

4004.559 --> 4008.079
it doesn't work properly if these issues

4006.96 --> 4011.52
are there

4008.079 --> 4013.44
then it should be automatically fixed

4011.52 --> 4016.24
as you start up the game and that's a

4013.44 --> 4019.44
fact it should automatically

4016.24 --> 4020.16
search that out i should not have to see

4019.44 --> 4022.64
a crash

4020.16 --> 4024.0
screen and then have to figure out what

4022.64 --> 4026.319
levers to switch

4024.0 --> 4028.799
before it stops crashing like that i

4026.319 --> 4031.52
should not have to do that

4028.799 --> 4034.96
and that's a fact that's what you pay

4031.52 --> 4039.0389999999998
the money for

4034.96 --> 4039.039
so don't smart lit me with that [ __ ]

4042.24 --> 4045.7599999999998
yeah now i'll system what the [ __ ] are

4044.079 --> 4048.319
you doing here yeah not all systems are

4045.76 --> 4051.5200000000004
configured the same that's right but

4048.319 --> 4053.839
yeah we're in 2020 now we've had

4051.52 --> 4055.119
like three decades of programming

4053.839 --> 4058.16
development

4055.119 --> 4060.1600000000003
and when you start up a game

4058.16 --> 4062.0
the game should literally find the

4060.16 --> 4062.8799999999997
viable route it can take in order to

4062.0 --> 4066.0
function

4062.88 --> 4069.2000000000003
it should do that that should be normal

4066.0 --> 4071.44
a person should not have to tinker away

4069.2 --> 4073.68
before they can just standardize start

4071.44 --> 4077.839
up a game

4073.68 --> 4077.839
it's that simple

4078.48 --> 4082.48
and i don't care if you think it's all

4080.799 --> 4084.799
right i don't care if you all

4082.48 --> 4086.88
accept that just because you are a

4084.799 --> 4088.799
little bit more apt with technology

4086.88 --> 4091.839
that it should be normal that products

4088.799 --> 4091.839
are sold that are broken

4092.0 --> 4095.359
you don't always get what i want well

4093.52 --> 4097.839
then i want my [ __ ] money back sean

4095.359 --> 4097.839
hawkins

4099.04 --> 4103.04
yeah if you go to like a

4103.52 --> 4109.92
an equipment store right

4106.56 --> 4112.159000000001
an equipment store like where drills and

4109.92 --> 4113.1990000000005
hammers and [ __ ] for like working on

4112.159 --> 4116.0
your house

4113.199 --> 4117.04
and you buy like this really expensive

4116.0 --> 4119.359
thing

4117.04 --> 4121.199
like a drill thing with a motor in it

4119.359 --> 4124.319
it's like has all these functions right

4121.199 --> 4126.96
super awesome so you plug it in

4124.319 --> 4127.6
and it doesn't do anything are you going

4126.96 --> 4130.96
to be like

4127.6 --> 4132.96
oh [ __ ] man oh dude i

4130.96 --> 4134.319
i have to figure out this design i have

4132.96 --> 4134.96
to figure out what's wrong with this

4134.319 --> 4138.400000000001
thing

4134.96 --> 4139.839
right and then fix it like take it open

4138.4 --> 4142.96
see if every part is

4139.839 --> 4144.96
if it's all right right no you go

4142.96 --> 4146.64
back to the [ __ ] store and says this

4144.96 --> 4147.359
[ __ ] thing is broken give me one that

4146.64 --> 4151.759
works

4147.359 --> 4156.159000000001
right now that's what you do

4151.759 --> 4158.88
yeah that's normal

4156.159 --> 4160.48
it doesn't matter if it's mechanical

4158.88 --> 4162.319
it's about the principle it's about you

4160.48 --> 4165.44
buy a product

4162.319 --> 4166.2390000000005
you're in the right to expect that it'll

4165.44 --> 4169.44
function

4166.239 --> 4175.839
and if it doesn't you should be able to

4169.44 --> 4175.839
demand your money back that's a fact

4181.679 --> 4187.759
no no it's not because i didn't use the

4185.6 --> 4188.64
game in a wrong fashion it just doesn't

4187.759 --> 4190.799
start up

4188.64 --> 4191.92
that's not the same thing if you

4190.799 --> 4194.64
literally

4191.92 --> 4195.6
can't get the thing to perform a basic

4194.64 --> 4198.400000000001
function of

4195.6 --> 4199.6
the drill bit turning if it cannot

4198.4 --> 4202.719
activate

4199.6 --> 4203.84
then it's broken and you don't go and

4202.719 --> 4207.04
try to

4203.84 --> 4208.64
figure out why oh let me try to fix it

4207.04 --> 4210.0
let's screw this open and see if

4208.64 --> 4212.08
everything is all right no you bring it

4210.0 --> 4214.0
back to the store and you get a new one

4212.08 --> 4216.32
or you get your money back and that's

4214.0 --> 4219.04
that's how it works

4216.32 --> 4221.36
and you're like allowed to do that under

4219.04 --> 4223.84
contract of buying

4221.36 --> 4223.839999999999
you get it

4226.8 --> 4230.4800000000005
okay i'm done with this [ __ ] subject

4229.12 --> 4232.32
guys

4230.48 --> 4233.839999999999
can you please just [ __ ] drop it

4232.32 --> 4235.759999999999
already or i'm gonna start banning you

4233.84 --> 4238.64
again i'm getting really sick

4235.76 --> 4240.159000000001
of these wise ass people telling me you

4238.64 --> 4241.92
did it wrong you did it wrong

4240.159 --> 4243.199
i paid 60 euros and i got a broken

4241.92 --> 4245.52
project

4243.199 --> 4246.719
okay i got a broken product and i'll

4245.52 --> 4249.76
give a [ __ ]

4246.719 --> 4253.76
what you think i should be doing

4249.76 --> 4256.88
i bought something it didn't work

4253.76 --> 4257.679
they should help me i should not have to

4256.88 --> 4261.92
[ __ ] look

4257.679 --> 4265.04
up anything i should have them

4261.92 --> 4266.32
talking to me saying like yeah right

4265.04 --> 4269.679
we've seen this problem

4266.32 --> 4272.719
have you tried this we tried that they

4269.679 --> 4276.0
should be telling me

4272.719 --> 4277.84
not the other way around

4276.0 --> 4280.8
because that's called service it's like

4277.84 --> 4283.28
service that comes with the product

4280.8 --> 4284.08
if you buy something you should there

4283.28 --> 4286.719
should not be an

4284.08 --> 4287.6
expectance that you are a professional

4286.719 --> 4289.36
mastery

4287.6 --> 4291.679
that you have professional mastery of

4289.36 --> 4293.99
the product in question

4291.679 --> 4297.6
that's unreasonable

4293.99 --> 4300.8
[Music]

4297.6 --> 4303.6
right yes george sanford i know but

4300.8 --> 4304.400000000001
i didn't see that until you pointed it

4303.6 --> 4306.719
out i

4304.4 --> 4308.4
there was no link to that from them

4306.719 --> 4310.32
nobody had pointed out

4308.4 --> 4312.0
that there were these routines that you

4310.32 --> 4315.84
can do until you

4312.0 --> 4315.84
linked me up with that george sanford so

4319.199 --> 4322.5599999999995
yeah piss off sean hawkins you

4321.52 --> 4325.120000000001
absolutely

4322.56 --> 4326.96
crack junkie head [ __ ] get the [ __ ]

4325.12 --> 4329.04
out of here man

4326.96 --> 4331.52
how the [ __ ] why are you even here in

4329.04 --> 4334.08
here piss off dude

4331.52 --> 4336.2390000000005
like you're not welcoming here ever

4334.08 --> 4337.12
you're a nasty scumbag i don't give a

4336.239 --> 4339.199
[ __ ]

4337.12 --> 4340.239
about your input but what you think

4339.199 --> 4342.239
you're good at

4340.239 --> 4344.4
or even that you have this notion that

4342.239 --> 4346.48
at some point we can be friendly

4344.4 --> 4357.839999999999
we can't you're a [ __ ] scumbag get

4346.48 --> 4357.839999999999
the [ __ ] out

4362.56 --> 4367.6
yeah because you know what i have like a

4366.239 --> 4371.36
whole bunch of games

4367.6 --> 4374.96
on there on like cds and dvds

4371.36 --> 4378.0
that when you put them in your computer

4374.96 --> 4378.0
and you install them

4379.44 --> 4384.5599999999995
it gives you everything you need on any

4382.239 --> 4386.959999999999
system as long as that system is

4384.56 --> 4388.400000000001
new enough to have the capacity to run

4386.96 --> 4391.6
that game

4388.4 --> 4394.879999999999
to run that game you don't

4391.6 --> 4398.64
need the internet

4394.88 --> 4399.84
to install it and it works every single

4398.64 --> 4401.76
time

4399.84 --> 4403.1990000000005
on every computer that's how a game

4401.76 --> 4406.719
should be not

4403.199 --> 4409.5199999999995
this crap not you buy

4406.719 --> 4411.28
something you download it it doesn't

4409.52 --> 4414.4800000000005
work

4411.28 --> 4416.719
all right i don't give a [ __ ]

4414.48 --> 4417.919999999999
about what's supposed to be normal out

4416.719 --> 4421.199
there right now

4417.92 --> 4424.719
it should not work like this this is

4421.199 --> 4427.759999999999
bad this is bad surface

4424.719 --> 4430.4
bad product

4427.76 --> 4432.320000000001
it's bro it's broken and it doesn't even

4430.4 --> 4433.44
have to do with the freaking game itself

4432.32 --> 4435.759999999999
it's just

4433.44 --> 4438.4
this is not how a game should be it's

4435.76 --> 4441.4400000000005
bad product

4438.4 --> 4444.48
it's company incompetence

4441.44 --> 4446.4
should not be and that's final that's

4444.48 --> 4448.239
final judgment i'm done

4446.4 --> 4450.48
with your stupid comments about this

4448.239 --> 4455.839999999999
[ __ ]

4450.48 --> 4455.839999999999

the game the game is

4524.0 --> 4530.0
installed it's there it's updated

4527.44 --> 4533.36
it just doesn't start up but i will

4530.0 --> 4535.36
check out the page you gave me

4533.36 --> 4538.48
because it is really specifically about

4535.36 --> 4541.92
crash on startup new install

4538.48 --> 4544.32
i will check out this page and see if i

4541.92 --> 4544.32
can do

4550.84 --> 4553.84
something

4554.719 --> 4559.679
it's a very extensive page by the way

4557.76 --> 4561.92
but i'll check it out at least it's

4559.679 --> 4564.159
something i can go on and

4561.92 --> 4565.679
we'll see if it works could be that it's

4564.159 --> 4568.719
not going to work

4565.679 --> 4571.36
well figure it out one way or the other

4568.719 --> 4571.36
thank you for that

4579.36 --> 4586.48
oh my behavior is toxic well eric parker

4583.28 --> 4588.239
you are out if if you have a problem

4586.48 --> 4590.48
with me complaining

4588.239 --> 4592.5599999999995
about a product that literally just

4590.48 --> 4594.5599999999995
doesn't work per default when i've paid

4592.56 --> 4597.6
money for it

4594.56 --> 4600.2390000000005
then you're just a whiny [ __ ]

4597.6 --> 4602.159000000001
you are the whiny [ __ ] i paid money for

4600.239 --> 4603.839999999999
a functioning product and i didn't get

4602.159 --> 4606.0
it and now i have to hassle

4603.84 --> 4607.28
to try and get it to function that's not

4606.0 --> 4610.48
normal

4607.28 --> 4610.88
when you buy a freaking car you expect

4610.48 --> 4613.678999999999
it

4610.88 --> 4614.32
to be able to turn the key and drive

4613.679 --> 4616.96
away

4614.32 --> 4618.639999999999
don't you maybe put some gas in it you

4616.96 --> 4620.8
expect that don't you

4618.64 --> 4622.96
so it's okay now that if you buy a new

4620.8 --> 4626.320000000001
product it's just broken and you have to

4622.96 --> 4629.199
go through a hassle to make it work

4626.32 --> 4631.12
what the [ __ ] are you man are you good

4629.199 --> 4635.04
in your head

4631.12 --> 4638.8
like are you okay with literal just

4635.04 --> 4640.56
society giving you getting money and

4638.8 --> 4642.64
then giving you broken products are you

4640.56 --> 4646.2390000000005
okay with that

4642.64 --> 4651.84
well if you are you're a [ __ ] slave

4646.239 --> 4651.839999999999
you're a slave then eric

4651.92 --> 4655.76
it doesn't work for me it doesn't work

4653.52 --> 4659.6
for me well guess what it doesn't work

4655.76 --> 4661.84
for a lot of people maybe karma may be

4659.6 --> 4665.84
your band maybe you can go [ __ ] yourself

4661.84 --> 4665.84
you [ __ ] scumbag

4667.52 --> 4671.84
maybe you could go [ __ ] yourself or or

4670.56 --> 4673.92
maybe you should just tell

4671.84 --> 4675.6
these people to go and [ __ ] kill

4673.92 --> 4678.32
themselves again

4675.6 --> 4678.96

4678.32 --> 4681.84
system

4678.96 --> 4682.32
out there where it's okay that you pay

4681.84 --> 4684.08
money

4682.32 --> 4686.0

4684.08 --> 4689.84

20 years ago you buy a game and it works

4904.4 --> 4908.08
it

4904.88 --> 4911.84
always works they they would not

4908.08 --> 4914.08
dare sell it if it just didn't work

4911.84 --> 4914.96
they would test it to work with every

4914.08 --> 4916.96
setup

4914.96 --> 4918.2390000000005
so that when you install it it would

4916.96 --> 4921.92
work

4918.239 --> 4925.759999999999
where is this gone where is this time

4921.92 --> 4927.36
why are there now just broken products

4952.96 --> 4956.88
been amused by this game

4954.4 --> 4958.239
for a second it's only been a nuisance

4956.88 --> 4960.4800000000005

4966.56 --> 4971.360000000001
game i just

4968.32 --> 4972.799999999999
feel absolutely like this is atrocious

4971.36 --> 4975.44
this company should not

4972.8 --> 4978.159000000001

4998.96 --> 5003.44
step by step to ensure that it'll work

5001.6 --> 5006.88
at the end of the conversation

5003.44 --> 5009.04
that's the response that i'm looking for

5006.88 --> 5010.2390000000005
when they do that then the company is

5009.04 --> 5011.92
redeemed

5010.239 --> 5013.919999999999
but i don't think they're going to do

5011.92 --> 5015.76
that because they just sent me an excuse

5013.92 --> 5017.04
message like sorry it might be a month

5015.76 --> 5020.320000000001
because a corona

5017.04 --> 5029.84
is [ __ ] unacceptable

5020.32 --> 5029.84
on accepta ball

5036.88 --> 5040.2390000000005
yeah that's right here we go again it

5038.239 --> 5041.04
was a lot of money it's freaking 60

5040.239 --> 5044.159
euros

5041.04 --> 5047.28
the [ __ ] that's like big game

5044.159 --> 5047.28
price okay

5049.52 --> 5053.120000000001
you expect you get an instantly

5051.12 --> 5054.0
functioning product no it doesn't have

5053.12 --> 5055.84
to be perfect

5054.0 --> 5057.36
doesn't have to be without any bugs you

5055.84 --> 5058.400000000001
know yeah sure it could crash or

5057.36 --> 5061.5199999999995
something that's

5058.4 --> 5063.28
that sucks but you should at least be

5061.52 --> 5066.88
able to just start it up

5063.28 --> 5069.28
just start it up and or get assistance

5066.88 --> 5071.28
personal assistance to get it started up

5069.28 --> 5074.32
very quickly

5071.28 --> 5078.8
because this is a disaster

5074.32 --> 5078.799999999999
it's literally ruining the franchise

5079.28 --> 5085.84
that it has this level of failure

5086.639 --> 5092.32
try 60g for truck with an engine that

5089.92 --> 5097.28
fails at less than thousand miles or

5092.32 --> 5097.28
100 miles damn yeah that's

5097.6 --> 5105.84
100k miles okay that sucks

5102.0 --> 5106.719
but yeah you get factory insurance for

5105.84 --> 5109.28
that [ __ ]

5106.719 --> 5110.96
you get your money back you or you get a

5109.28 --> 5113.84
new one instantly delivered to your

5110.96 --> 5113.84
front door right

5123.44 --> 5126.719
isn't baldr's getting early access now

5125.44 --> 5129.759999999999
no it's

5126.719 --> 5131.6
it's literally published

5129.76 --> 5133.280000000001
like when you look it up it says like

5131.6 --> 5136.56
it's it's published

5133.28 --> 5139.44
it's been published since november

5136.56 --> 5139.92
or even october i don't remember but

5139.44 --> 5143.12
it's been

5139.92 --> 5143.12
it's it's up it's open

5145.44 --> 5154.08
early access early access yeah

5148.56 --> 5156.080000000001
you don't pay 60 euros for early access

5154.08 --> 5157.5199999999995
you just yeah that's just called buying

5156.08 --> 5160.719
the game so

5157.52 --> 5160.719
it's out when it's out

5163.36 --> 5172.0
lawsuits with very little recourse jesus

5167.12 --> 5172.0
what the hell that's insane

5177.28 --> 5183.84
tagged as early access and what

5194.84 --> 5200.88
okay

5197.84 --> 5202.88
that's weird because i did not get the

5200.88 --> 5206.159000000001
impression i thought it was out

5202.88 --> 5206.159000000001
i thought it was just out

5207.04 --> 5210.48
i literally just bought the product so i

5208.96 --> 5211.679
don't know it didn't say oh get the

5210.48 --> 5214.718999999999
early access now

5211.679 --> 5217.679
later the release date no it's just like

5214.719 --> 5219.679
no suppose the release date was said

5217.679 --> 5223.76
when i googled it

5219.679 --> 5225.52
like in october or something so yeah

5223.76 --> 5229.1990000000005
don't know where this early access

5225.52 --> 5229.1990000000005
situation is coming from maybe

5229.44 --> 5233.44
maybe steam did tag it like that

5236.4 --> 5241.04
because of the issues with it i don't

5238.88 --> 5241.04
know

5241.12 --> 5246.32
i don't know but i'm just really

5243.28 --> 5248.4
disappointed about this [ __ ]

5246.32 --> 5250.48
and i want my money back you know i'll

5248.4 --> 5253.5199999999995
i'll i'll re-buy it

5250.48 --> 5256.159
i'll rebuy it whenever i get the idea

5253.52 --> 5259.360000000001
okay it's working now

5256.159 --> 5261.12
that would be my attitude because it's a

5259.36 --> 5263.36
game that i want to have bought

5261.12 --> 5264.239
i want it on record like i've bought

5263.36 --> 5266.5599999999995
this so i have

5264.239 --> 5268.08
literally the right to have this game if

5266.56 --> 5270.8
at some point people are going to be

5268.08 --> 5272.48
oh you downloaded something it's illegal

5270.8 --> 5274.08
and i would be like no i [ __ ] bought

5272.48 --> 5274.799999999999
this game i don't give a [ __ ] i can

5274.08 --> 5277.6
download

5274.8 --> 5280.0
thousands of copies and i can play them

5277.6 --> 5281.92
because i paid money once

5280.0 --> 5283.92
for the official product and i have the

5281.92 --> 5285.4400000000005
right to play this game under every

5283.92 --> 5288.56
circumstances

5285.44 --> 5290.879999999999
that's my policy you know

5288.56 --> 5292.320000000001
that's why i got the original bot copies

5290.88 --> 5295.84
of the baldur's gate games

5292.32 --> 5300.239
all of them baldur's gate 1 extension

5295.84 --> 5302.159000000001
2 extension and well dragon spear but

5300.239 --> 5303.44
that's a digital only i wish dragon

5302.159 --> 5306.0
spear had like a

5303.44 --> 5307.5199999999995
an actual dvd version that you can buy

5306.0 --> 5310.48
like where are these

5307.52 --> 5312.4800000000005
we need that back we need install disk

5310.48 --> 5314.718999999999
games back

5312.48 --> 5318.48
because this digital only situation i

5314.719 --> 5318.4800000000005
don't like it i don't like it at all

5321.52 --> 5328.0
no early access is still there i'm wrong

5324.8 --> 5328.0
okay what

5335.04 --> 5339.199
i miss going to the store and browsing

5336.719 --> 5341.28
games yeah me too casey

5339.199 --> 5342.719
it was always great it was always like

5341.28 --> 5346.159
what what

5342.719 --> 5349.679
treasure am i gonna dig up because

5346.159 --> 5352.4
browsing through games in a store

5349.679 --> 5353.679
you get to see a lot more in a in a

5352.4 --> 5357.839999999999
better way

5353.679 --> 5359.84
in in ways than browsing it on google

5357.84 --> 5362.56
because google always shows you things

5359.84 --> 5365.360000000001
in a certain order and all that [ __ ]

5362.56 --> 5365.92
right in a store it's just there there's

5365.36 --> 5368.719
no

5365.92 --> 5370.159
algorithm presenting it in a certain

5368.719 --> 5372.8
pattern to you

5370.159 --> 5373.759999999999
it's different you just get to see

5372.8 --> 5376.320000000001
whatever's there

5373.76 --> 5377.6
i used to like that a lot browsing games

5376.32 --> 5380.48
physically

5377.6 --> 5380.4800000000005
i missed that time

5380.88 --> 5384.4800000000005
i remember when i first found like

5382.56 --> 5386.080000000001
baldur's gate too like in there was like

5384.48 --> 5390.159
oh

5386.08 --> 5394.48
i can see it at a distance it's here

5390.159 --> 5394.48
oh what a time that was

5402.8 --> 5406.2390000000005
pillars of eternity yes i i've had i

5405.44 --> 5410.32
have that too

5406.239 --> 5412.4
i've played that it's pretty cool

5410.32 --> 5413.84
i had problems with it though at some

5412.4 --> 5417.12
point it literally broke

5413.84 --> 5418.88
it was just an unresolvable break in the

5417.12 --> 5420.88
game

5418.88 --> 5423.52
after that i was kind of sick of it but

5420.88 --> 5425.92
it was pretty cool

5423.52 --> 5427.6
philosophy fraternity is pretty cool

5425.92 --> 5429.28
tyranny i don't know about that never

5427.6 --> 5431.6
heard of that before

5429.28 --> 5435.199
i usually would not like a game that's

5431.6 --> 5437.280000000001
called like that but pillars of eternity

5435.199 --> 5438.879999999999
was pretty interesting

5437.28 --> 5440.719
it was an interesting mechanism they

5438.88 --> 5444.4800000000005
built as a standard

5440.719 --> 5448.159
it's like this way

5444.48 --> 5448.959999999999
like this this system like their version

5448.159 --> 5450.96
of dnd

5448.96 --> 5453.04
how they interpret it in the mechanisms

5450.96 --> 5454.4
in the game was viable it's like yeah

5453.04 --> 5455.679
there could be more games with this

5454.4 --> 5457.599999999999
system that would work pretty

5455.679 --> 5460.8
interestingly

5457.6 --> 5460.8
i thought it was an interesting

5460.84 --> 5466.88
experiment

5462.96 --> 5468.88
but yeah it absolutely absolutely pales

5466.88 --> 5472.400000000001
compared to the baldur's gate games

5468.88 --> 5474.639
absolutely pills so

5472.4 --> 5475.679
you know i played pillars of fraternity

5474.639 --> 5477.679
once and then i was like

5475.679 --> 5479.52
okay i'm gonna go play baldur's gate now

5477.679 --> 5482.4800000000005
for the 60th time

5479.52 --> 5483.679
because it's more fun and the music is

5482.48 --> 5486.0
better

5483.679 --> 5488.4800000000005
even though music was not bad at pillars

5486.0 --> 5491.84
of eternity

5488.48 --> 5491.839999999999
just wasn't good enough for me

5495.04 --> 5497.36
right

5498.32 --> 5501.84
updating graphics driver

5503.04 --> 5507.92
okay michael jones what

5506.4 --> 5510.638999999999
but i don't think there's a problem with

5507.92 --> 5511.04
that it's just a lorry launcher that

5510.639 --> 5513.52
just

5511.04 --> 5514.239
is [ __ ] it doesn't say what else

5513.52 --> 5517.120000000001
there's no

5514.239 --> 5519.44
physical problem you know my stuff is

5517.12 --> 5522.719
pretty good

5519.44 --> 5525.839999999999
but who knows in a way

5522.719 --> 5529.199
i would almost say could somebody baby

5525.84 --> 5531.12
do this with me over skype

5529.199 --> 5532.4
can i have somebody look over my

5531.12 --> 5534.639
shoulder

5532.4 --> 5535.759999999999
basically with this some technical

5534.639 --> 5537.36
assistance

5535.76 --> 5540.2390000000005
because i i might be just in my

5537.36 --> 5542.08
frustration missing out on things

5540.239 --> 5544.159
like things pass me by that it should

5542.08 --> 5547.04
actually notice and then

5544.159 --> 5548.638999999999
maybe we could fix it together i would

5547.04 --> 5550.08
kind of appreciate that if somebody

5548.639 --> 5553.679
would be willing to basically

5550.08 --> 5557.44
spend some time with me on skype to

5553.679 --> 5557.4400000000005
to try and fix that situation

5557.76 --> 5562.4800000000005
event viewer will say the problem for

5559.92 --> 5562.4800000000005
the crash

5565.04 --> 5569.44
i would but i don't do skype oh alright

5571.36 --> 5575.839999999999
that's very disappointing

5577.199 --> 5589.839999999999
all right by the way be right back

5674.96 --> 5678.1
[Music]

5684.84 --> 5687.84
yo

5689.52 --> 5693.92
i hope minsk and boo make an appearance

5691.6 --> 5697.04
on baldur's gate 3.

5693.92 --> 5699.119
i don't know probably not it's like it's

5697.04 --> 5700.48
not really baldur's gate 3 anymore you

5699.119 --> 5703.44
know

5700.48 --> 5703.839999999999
it's because baldur's gate 2 at the end

5703.44 --> 5706.239
of it

5703.84 --> 5707.84
it's literally it's done like the game

5706.239 --> 5710.799999999999
is actually over

5707.84 --> 5713.6
you potentially ascend into literal

5710.8 --> 5717.76
deity status after that point

5713.6 --> 5717.76
or go out on another adventure but just

5718.159 --> 5722.48
i did not recognize any characters

5722.719 --> 5725.92
but who knows maybe he will be in there

5724.639 --> 5727.92
maybe they

5725.92 --> 5729.04
they yeah they did that after i don't

5727.92 --> 5732.8
know i

5729.04 --> 5732.8
haven't been able to start it up yet

5740.84 --> 5743.84
so

5747.84 --> 5757.6
yeah 150 gigabytes of space that's right

5752.48 --> 5761.48
the install file was 78 gigabytes

5757.6 --> 5764.96
did you get it the game

5761.48 --> 5768.08
78 gigabytes

5764.96 --> 5771.84
it's insane absolutely insane it

5768.08 --> 5771.84
wouldn't fit on my ssd

5772.4 --> 5785.839999999999
the room that was left there it just

5773.679 --> 5785.84
wouldn't fit

5796.84 --> 5799.84
if

5807.28 --> 5813.84
really they got a lot of [ __ ] there

5823.199 --> 5827.119
no it doesn't it does not need windows

5825.6 --> 5831.1990000000005
10 apparently

5827.119 --> 5834.48
pian pin is wrath it does not

5831.199 --> 5834.48
specifically does not

5837.44 --> 5845.5199999999995
windows 7 is absolutely an option

5842.239 --> 5847.36
like even in the reporting system it's

5845.52 --> 5849.6
an option it's in there

5847.36 --> 5851.759999999999
i wouldn't even been able to install it

5849.6 --> 5855.360000000001
if it couldn't install on windows 7

5851.76 --> 5855.92
okay so no it does not require windows

5855.36 --> 5857.679
10

5855.92 --> 5869.84
and i'm not going to update to windows

5857.679 --> 5869.84
10 done

5870.88 --> 5874.400000000001
all right but anyway aries 106. yeah you

5872.88 --> 5875.84
got a point there

5874.4 --> 5877.599999999999
this is probably going to be riddled

5875.84 --> 5878.719
with bugs if they can't even normally

5877.6 --> 5880.639
start up

5878.719 --> 5882.719
i don't really care too much about that

5880.639 --> 5886.159000000001
though you know

5882.719 --> 5888.32
because i just want to play something

5886.159 --> 5890.08
just something maybe create a character

5888.32 --> 5890.96
i could probably spend like hours just

5890.08 --> 5893.28
doing that

5890.96 --> 5895.119
figuring out how can i make the ultimate

5893.28 --> 5897.92
elf paladin

5895.119 --> 5899.5199999999995
wizard arwin and make him literally look

5897.92 --> 5901.4400000000005
like me [ __ ] around with that

5899.52 --> 5904.080000000001
just that like it i wouldn't even care

5901.44 --> 5907.36
about the gameplay

5904.08 --> 5908.32
just i want to i want to do something

5907.36 --> 5910.4
with it

5908.32 --> 5911.36
and then i'll just wait years and years

5910.4 --> 5913.679
and years until

5911.36 --> 5915.5199999999995
all the stupid bugs have finally been

5913.679 --> 5917.1990000000005
ironed out and then i'll just normally

5915.52 --> 5920.159000000001
play it

5917.199 --> 5921.678999999999
because i want this game anyway i want

5920.159 --> 5924.159
this as part of my

5921.679 --> 5925.679
games even if it's not working right now

5924.159 --> 5927.92
but this situation

5925.679 --> 5929.679
just not being able to start it up that

5927.92 --> 5932.159
is just one

5929.679 --> 5935.36
that's one error too far like they got

5932.159 --> 5938.96
i'm pissed off about that

5935.36 --> 5941.92
minimum windows 7 sp 1 64 bit well there

5938.96 --> 5944.96
you go that's exactly what i got

5941.92 --> 5948.0
that's what i got 64 bit

5944.96 --> 5951.679
that's right windows 7 64-bit yes

5948.0 --> 5967.84
windows 7 64-bit that's my computer

5951.679 --> 5967.84
has been since the start

5978.84 --> 5981.84
ugh

5991.36 --> 5994.4
right so yeah now that we're all done

5993.52 --> 5996.719
about this and

5994.4 --> 5999.119
spent like one and a half hours only

5996.719 --> 6000.8
talking about baldur's gate

5999.119 --> 6002.32
to the point where i had to ban a couple

6000.8 --> 6004.96
of people because they just wouldn't

6002.32 --> 6006.08
shut up with their stupid judgment about

6004.96 --> 6008.2390000000005
it

6006.08 --> 6010.239
and they're cocking to society breaking

6008.239 --> 6012.159
down that's oh it's so normal

6010.239 --> 6013.5199999999995
why why aren't you a professional

6012.159 --> 6022.48
programmer in order to

6013.52 --> 6026.0
start up a game you know

6022.48 --> 6028.159
what this is d4 os but

6026.0 --> 6029.6
for games downgrade to a hybrid disk

6028.159 --> 6031.04
what is what what are you talking about

6029.6 --> 6032.08
hybrid disk i don't know what you're

6031.04 --> 6034.4
talking about

6032.08 --> 6036.88
but ssd for games have been has been

6034.4 --> 6041.28
working absolutely stellar for me

6036.88 --> 6043.679
stellar that's why the 250 gigabyte

6041.28 --> 6044.32
ssd disk which is also the operating

6043.679 --> 6047.36
system

6044.32 --> 6049.44
i used it to install the games and now

6047.36 --> 6051.44
not too modern games so they're not

6049.44 --> 6053.04
crazy sized like the biggest game before

6051.44 --> 6055.199
this was

6053.04 --> 6056.4
three and a half gigabytes it was pretty

6055.199 --> 6059.678999999999
large it all

6056.4 --> 6061.679
fit easily easily so much room in there

6059.679 --> 6065.6
and it all perfect perfect just

6061.679 --> 6069.119
instant game bang right

6065.6 --> 6070.400000000001
so the problem was this specific game

6069.119 --> 6072.88
was just too big

6070.4 --> 6074.879999999999
so i eventually had to install it on my

6072.88 --> 6075.679
hot regular hard disk but it still

6074.88 --> 6078.159000000001
worked

6075.679 --> 6079.04
it still just installed didn't say like

6078.159 --> 6082.159
this can't work

6079.04 --> 6082.159
it's gonna give problems now

6083.119 --> 6088.4
the the medium it was installed and was

6085.52 --> 6088.400000000001
never the problem

6088.96 --> 6095.28
but hey i got a one gigabyte

6092.0 --> 6099.6
updated ssd disk i can

6095.28 --> 6099.599999999999
if required install it on that

6104.32 --> 6107.04
exactly

6108.08 --> 6116.0
why why directx i

6112.8 --> 6118.96
i got directx i got it all

6116.0 --> 6121.84
like there is no directx that just came

6118.96 --> 6123.84
out that make this possible no directx

6121.84 --> 6125.679
like that whole system was like rounded

6123.84 --> 6129.4400000000005
out perfected

6125.679 --> 6133.1990000000005
years ago with directx

6129.44 --> 6134.0
11. it was done there was nothing more

6133.199 --> 6138.0
that could be done

6134.0 --> 6139.12
with it yeah the newest directx 11

6138.0 --> 6141.28
update what

6139.12 --> 6144.239
[Music]

6141.28 --> 6145.84

6145.84 --> 6149.04
hangout i'm done with it

6147.04 --> 6151.04
no more [ __ ] computers because this

6149.04 --> 6155.44
is just a waste of everybody's time

6151.04 --> 6157.5199999999995
lame okay done with it but

6155.44 --> 6158.799999999999

6167.199 --> 6174.839999999999
it's dumbest freaking hangout this week

6171.76 --> 6177.84

6193.92 --> 6197.36
people having their after thoughts

although maybe you could do this after

6197.36 --> 6200.4
all because i know people are not gonna

6198.639 --> 6202.719
let this go anymore now

6200.4 --> 6204.08
like everybody now in chat is only

6202.719 --> 6209.28
thinking about this [ __ ]

6204.08 --> 6209.28
game and what to do sick of it

6213.199 --> 6216.239
yeah i do hope i get it to run to aries

6215.44 --> 6220.159
106.

6216.239 --> 6221.36
well that page that george sanford

6220.159 --> 6224.4
forwarded me is

6221.36 --> 6226.239
it might actually help so i'm going to

6224.4 --> 6229.599999999999
do that

6226.239 --> 6232.5599999999995
probably after this after this is over

6229.6 --> 6234.320000000001
i'm going to get some groceries quickly

6232.56 --> 6235.4400000000005
before it gets too cold and then when

6234.32 --> 6238.159
i'm back i'm going to

6235.44 --> 6239.199
try to fix this situation and i'll get

6238.159 --> 6241.119
back to you guys

6239.199 --> 6242.48
if i get it to work i'll i'll let you

6241.119 --> 6245.759999999999
know

6242.48 --> 6246.0
i really really am done talking about it

6245.76 --> 6248.96
right

6246.0 --> 6248.96
now on this hangout

6250.159 --> 6254.96
so anything else if there's anything

6252.8 --> 6254.96
else

6258.84 --> 6261.84
left

6283.119 --> 6289.839999999999
microsoft one

6290.8 --> 6293.28
all right

6294.88 --> 6301.1990000000005
okay i'll check that out george sanford

6298.0 --> 6304.639
surface devices

6301.199 --> 6304.638999999999
platform update

6306.48 --> 6311.678999999999
okay i'll check that out maybe this will

6309.36 --> 6311.679
help

6314.639 --> 6331.84
or it'll [ __ ] break my computer apart

6332.8 --> 6335.360000000001
we'll see

6337.6 --> 6344.96
it's already installed on this computer

6340.0 --> 6350.48
thanks for trying

6344.96 --> 6350.4800000000005
yeah i already got one george sanford

6351.6 --> 6355.360000000001
see that this is what i mean like dude

6354.48 --> 6358.638999999999
like i

6355.36 --> 6360.4
am a clean freak

6358.639 --> 6361.679
when it comes to my computer like a

6360.4 --> 6364.4
clean freak

6361.679 --> 6365.28
some people have a kitchen and then

6364.4 --> 6367.199
every time

6365.28 --> 6369.04
they finish cooking they spend like half

6367.199 --> 6369.5199999999995
an hour perfectly cleaning it right

6369.04 --> 6372.48
clean

6369.52 --> 6373.6
freaks i'm that with my computer

6372.48 --> 6376.32
literally

6373.6 --> 6377.4400000000005
every time i clean it up like a

6376.32 --> 6380.5599999999995
[ __ ]

6377.44 --> 6381.759999999999
every corner every freaking corner every

6380.56 --> 6383.52
file

6381.76 --> 6384.88
that's really not in the place it's

6383.52 --> 6387.679
supposed to be

6384.88 --> 6388.4800000000005
everything superfluous every superfluous

6387.679 --> 6391.36
note

6388.48 --> 6392.879999999999
i'm a clean freak and i got everything

6391.36 --> 6395.599999999999
updated

6392.88 --> 6396.719
and i got my spybot search and destroy

6395.6 --> 6399.92
updated

6396.719 --> 6401.84
and i i recheck my installed program

6399.92 --> 6402.8
files every now and then like is

6401.84 --> 6406.32
everything here

6402.8 --> 6408.4800000000005
useful and then uninstall whatever

6406.32 --> 6410.08
even the smallest thing if it's

6408.48 --> 6412.48
basically an outdated

6410.08 --> 6413.199
or i don't trust it anymore or i don't

6412.48 --> 6416.159
need it

6413.199 --> 6418.239
i'm a clean freak when it comes to the

6416.159 --> 6421.04
content of my computer

6418.239 --> 6423.678999999999
so it's fully updated it's as updated as

6421.04 --> 6427.199
as it can be now that doesn't mean it's

6423.679 --> 6428.4
perfect because there are weird issues

6427.199 --> 6430.239
with the updates

6428.4 --> 6431.92
like there are updates that have been

6430.239 --> 6433.04
sitting there for a while these they're

6431.92 --> 6436.08
supposed to be

6433.04 --> 6437.36
important updates i literally am unable

6436.08 --> 6440.4
to install them

6437.36 --> 6440.96
i've tried many many times many times

6440.4 --> 6444.48
just

6440.96 --> 6445.199
it feels oh it doesn't make any sense it

6444.48 --> 6447.44
fails

6445.199 --> 6449.04
well it doesn't matter because it just

6447.44 --> 6450.48
keeps on failing and there's nothing i

6449.04 --> 6452.56
can do about it

6450.48 --> 6454.32
not that i've been needing these updates

6452.56 --> 6456.8
because my update my computer's been

6454.32 --> 6459.92
working just fine

6456.8 --> 6462.4800000000005
but yeah the update just kind of broke

6459.92 --> 6471.84
at some point

6462.48 --> 6471.839999999999
weird how that worked

6483.679 --> 6486.88
anti-static wrist strap when you're

6485.52 --> 6488.320000000001
working your computer friends that it

6486.88 --> 6493.04
says

6488.32 --> 6495.5199999999995
i know no it's not no

6493.04 --> 6496.719
don't worry about it i know what i'm

6495.52 --> 6500.400000000001
doing dude i

6496.719 --> 6502.8
i literally part by part made

6500.4 --> 6504.638999999999
and fully installed from scratch this

6502.8 --> 6504.96
computer i know computers don't worry

6504.639 --> 6508.0
about

6504.96 --> 6511.44
it no i i know

6508.0 --> 6513.84
the dangers of static shocks and all

6511.44 --> 6513.839999999999
that

6518.56 --> 6526.0
right exactly george sanford says

6523.52 --> 6527.92
and besides the the air here is

6526.0 --> 6529.679
currently not that dry anyway so there's

6527.92 --> 6531.52
not a lot of static electricity in the

6529.679 --> 6533.6
air

6531.52 --> 6535.52
you know if it was very cold and dry

6533.6 --> 6537.119000000001
yeah then that [ __ ] typically happens

6535.52 --> 6538.96
you get shocks from metal and all that

6537.119 --> 6539.44
then you got to be careful better to

6538.96 --> 6543.28
just

6539.44 --> 6544.96
not get in your computer at such times

6543.28 --> 6548.5599999999995
but it's the weather's not like that at

6544.96 --> 6548.56
all so i'm not afraid

6553.599 --> 6559.679
all right i'll see you later plunder 23

6556.719 --> 6559.679
have a nice cycle

6565.76 --> 6568.88
earth past year i really for a second i

6568.0 --> 6570.96
thought you were

6568.88 --> 6573.52
gonna tell me to wear a mask for some

6570.96 --> 6583.84
reason or something but

6573.52 --> 6583.84
i was wrong

6611.52 --> 6613.92
all right

6617.199 --> 6623.119
anyway i'm also gonna go buy another

6620.719 --> 6625.28
piece for my computer by the way because

6623.119 --> 6628.639
i basically

6625.28 --> 6631.04
took the standard back side fan

6628.639 --> 6633.36
out of it because this thing was making

6631.04 --> 6636.159
noise like a [ __ ]

6633.36 --> 6637.44
and i'm sick of it so i'm gonna get a

6636.159 --> 6639.839999999999
new one

6637.44 --> 6641.28
but the store i got my ssd disc didn't

6639.84 --> 6644.88
have the the right model

6641.28 --> 6644.88
so i'm going to go to another store

6645.04 --> 6653.84
that they recommended to me

6648.159 --> 6653.839999999999
and see if they got the right fan

6656.159 --> 6659.28
like my computer is just running just

6657.76 --> 6661.599
fine without it right

6659.28 --> 6664.88
it's really only in the summer when i

6661.599 --> 6667.360000000001
ever ever need it because my computer

6664.88 --> 6668.639
it just never overheats it's it's so

6667.36 --> 6671.28
overqualified i

6668.639 --> 6673.92
i don't strain it enough to ever get

6671.28 --> 6673.92
overheated

6675.92 --> 6679.36
i know earth passenger it's okay it's

6678.4 --> 6682.638999999999
okay

6679.36 --> 6682.639
you didn't get a timeout

6684.08 --> 6688.239
i just got sick of people basically

6686.159 --> 6691.44
telling me i'm bad i'm wrong

6688.239 --> 6694.638999999999
for being pissed off that i yeah

6691.44 --> 6696.799999999999
that i'm outraged that i

6694.639 --> 6697.84
paid 60 euros for something that it just

6696.8 --> 6699.360000000001
doesn't work

6697.84 --> 6701.52
and then apparently some people out

6699.36 --> 6705.119
there think that that's me

6701.52 --> 6708.0
me being a whiny [ __ ] and that

6705.119 --> 6708.639
that's really what got me worked up here

6708.0 --> 6710.88
not

6708.639 --> 6713.4400000000005
people trying to help me out so don't

6710.88 --> 6713.4400000000005
worry about it

6715.76 --> 6719.360000000001
yeah i'm not gonna get anything off the

6717.76 --> 6722.0
freaking internet

6719.36 --> 6722.48
like that i'm gonna go to a store and

6722.0 --> 6725.599
then

6722.48 --> 6727.199
physically touch it and compare it and

6725.599 --> 6730.56
ask the person

6727.199 --> 6731.919999999999
for advice like is this the same

6730.56 --> 6733.92
i'm gonna order something of the

6731.92 --> 6736.96
internet you know what happens

6733.92 --> 6738.96
i'll accidentally pick the wrong one

6736.96 --> 6740.96
and then after wait a long time then i

6738.96 --> 6741.44
got a product that i wasted money on

6740.96 --> 6745.44
it's

6741.44 --> 6750.879999999999
wrong and then i'm [ __ ] stupid

6745.44 --> 6753.759999999999
i'm not gonna do that

6750.88 --> 6755.04
not for replacing a part anyway of a

6753.76 --> 6757.52
computer that's like

6755.04 --> 6758.4
almost 10 years old it doesn't really

6757.52 --> 6759.84
work well

6758.4 --> 6762.08
you know if you're gonna build a

6759.84 --> 6764.400000000001
completely from scratch new computer

6762.08 --> 6766.5599999999995
sure then ordering all the parts on the

6764.4 --> 6770.239
internet it's gonna work out fine

6766.56 --> 6772.719
because you know exit you already know

6770.239 --> 6774.08
exactly that they will fit together if

6772.719 --> 6775.199
you get the right brand and all that

6774.08 --> 6777.76
that's different but

6775.199 --> 6779.44
replacing old computer parts that's much

6777.76 --> 6781.52
more difficult

6779.44 --> 6783.5199999999995
because those parts basically get

6781.52 --> 6785.679
outdated and they're no longer sold and

6783.52 --> 6787.1990000000005
then you have to find the right model to

6785.679 --> 6788.08
replace it because if you just take the

6787.199 --> 6790.719
latest one oh

6788.08 --> 6792.159
guess what it's not gonna fit yeah

6790.719 --> 6796.88
almost bought another one

6792.159 --> 6798.08
until i saw that the plug didn't match

6796.88 --> 6801.92
if i would have bought that i wouldn't

6798.08 --> 6804.08
even even be able to plug it in

6801.92 --> 6805.599
so i'm gonna go to the other store and

6804.08 --> 6807.04
see if they got the right one it could

6805.599 --> 6808.8
turn out to be that

6807.04 --> 6811.119
it's just not going to be replaced it's

6808.8 --> 6814.08
just not going to be a fan

6811.119 --> 6816.88
to replace it and then fine i'll just go

6814.08 --> 6816.88
on without it

6817.28 --> 6821.84
right hey adam mikken

6822.48 --> 6825.678999999999
see you later robin stanley

6826.48 --> 6832.839999999999
right yeah adam you're late i i'm

6829.36 --> 6834.32
literally just about to round out the

6832.84 --> 6836.32
show

6834.32 --> 6838.5599999999995
oh by the way i just realized i'm not

6836.32 --> 6838.96
going to go out and buy that fan because

6838.56 --> 6840.96
it's

6838.96 --> 6843.04
sunday so the store is going to be

6840.96 --> 6849.84
closed

6843.04 --> 6849.84
that's a bit of a bummer

6859.679 --> 6866.639
that's okay

6863.52 --> 6868.88
i always get i'm always late on the iron

6866.639 --> 6869.36
realm live streams on friday mornings

6868.88 --> 6872.639
anyway

6869.36 --> 6873.5199999999995
too i always arrive late hope you're

6872.639 --> 6876.400000000001
doing all right yeah

6873.52 --> 6879.4400000000005
adam you probably had a bit of a late

6876.4 --> 6879.44
night yesterday as well

6880.96 --> 6884.0
ball busters and all

6884.32 --> 6887.679
have i heard from good servant lately

6886.56 --> 6890.159000000001
not so much

6887.679 --> 6891.599
good servant is just being really

6890.159 --> 6893.36
freaking weird

6891.599 --> 6895.76
like it's freaking me out i literally

6893.36 --> 6897.44
told him like don't talk to me again

6895.76 --> 6899.04
until you start acting like a normal

6897.44 --> 6900.799999999999
human being again

6899.04 --> 6902.639
because he's he's acting like there's

6900.8 --> 6906.56
something really weird going on i think

6902.639 --> 6906.56
he's having a severe paranoid

6906.96 --> 6910.4
psychosis or something i don't know what

6909.36 --> 6913.598999999999
the hell's going on

6910.4 --> 6915.28
but he's acting really weird like typing

6913.599 --> 6917.1990000000005
things in the skype chat

6915.28 --> 6920.0
and then deleting them and then i told

6917.199 --> 6921.759999999999
them okay don't do that anymore

6920.0 --> 6925.679
and then i kept on doing it told them

6921.76 --> 6929.599
like if you are going to

6925.679 --> 6933.599
do that again i am going to block you

6929.599 --> 6935.599
and then he did it again so

6933.599 --> 6937.1990000000005
yeah i don't know what the [ __ ] is going

6935.599 --> 6940.96
on with him but

6937.199 --> 6942.96
to me to me my preliminary analysis is

6940.96 --> 6944.08
that he's having a psychotic breakdown

6942.96 --> 6947.199
for real

6944.08 --> 6949.28
and i don't know what to do about it

6947.199 --> 6950.239
because he seems to be extremely

6949.28 --> 6954.08
paranoid now

6950.239 --> 6956.4
and he failed to convey that

6954.08 --> 6957.679
i don't know if i can trust you anymore

6956.4 --> 6961.28
arwen

6957.679 --> 6962.0
which like what what the [ __ ] are you

6961.28 --> 6965.44
talking about

6962.0 --> 6966.0
what the hell did i ever do to basically

6965.44 --> 6968.719
make you

6966.0 --> 6969.119
change your attitude like that towards

6968.719 --> 6971.36
me

6969.119 --> 6973.199
like what did i ever do can you tell me

6971.36 --> 6974.0
what the thing was and he wouldn't he

6973.199 --> 6977.598999999999
was afraid

6974.0 --> 6980.719
so there's something really wrong

6977.599 --> 6984.96
and i'm i'm worried

6980.719 --> 6988.0
not tom not tom good servant

6999.199 --> 7002.719
like a normal human being again

7001.28 --> 7004.5599999999995
because i can't communicate with him

7002.719 --> 7010.159
when he's like this i just can't

7004.56 --> 7010.159000000001

7038.56 --> 7041.4400000000005
like he is then

7042.239 --> 7046.718999999999
and why doesn't he come back in my chat

7044.4 --> 7046.719
ever

7048.56 --> 7051.76
and when i basically ask him in the

7050.639 --> 7054.2390000000005
skype like hey

uh when are we gonna talk again he like

7054.239 --> 7059.28
upvotes and hearts everything

7056.719 --> 7061.44
and doesn't respond he's acting like a

7059.28 --> 7063.679
complete freak and i'm getting really

7061.44 --> 7065.919999999999
annoyed by it

7063.679 --> 7065.92
so

7071.679 --> 7076.56
yeah yeah he was wounded in combat he

7073.92 --> 7077.84
has ptsd issues and he is clinically

7076.56 --> 7082.56
psychotic

7077.84 --> 7085.1990000000005
official on a paper registered as such

7082.56 --> 7086.080000000001
having had like pretty strong medication

7085.199 --> 7087.759999999999
for that

7086.08 --> 7089.5199999999995
it doesn't matter i've talked with him

7087.76 --> 7091.679
for years and now

7089.52 --> 7092.8
he's suddenly behaving like a total

7091.679 --> 7095.84
freak

7092.8 --> 7098.2390000000005
and he doesn't even explain why

7095.84 --> 7099.1990000000005
so i don't know what is going on but

7098.239 --> 7102.5599999999995
i've just he's

7099.199 --> 7104.879999999999
disconnected to me for no apparent

7102.56 --> 7104.88
reason

7108.32 --> 7113.119
he seems like oh well maybe he's just

7110.56 --> 7115.599
declared enemy maybe i am satan now

7113.119 --> 7117.598999999999
maybe good servant actually thinks that

7115.599 --> 7118.0
i am the antichrist maybe that's the

7117.599 --> 7121.119000000001
case

7118.0 --> 7122.4
have you asked him maybe somebody should

7121.119 --> 7126.5599999999995
ask him

7122.4 --> 7129.44
because i feel absolutely scoffed

7126.56 --> 7142.96
to by him i don't know why he's doing

7129.44 --> 7145.44
what he's doing medical history

7142.96 --> 7147.679
without him present well he's admitted

7145.44 --> 7147.678999999999
that

7148.56 --> 7151.76
i literally addressed him about it on

7150.8 --> 7154.4800000000005
air

7151.76 --> 7155.599
yeah so yeah that's all very nice you

7154.48 --> 7158.879999999999
asked the questions i

7155.599 --> 7160.8
answered it right

7158.88 --> 7163.599
and he's still a great guy but he's

7160.8 --> 7165.679
acting like what the [ __ ]

7163.599 --> 7167.119000000001
he won't even normally communicate with

7165.679 --> 7170.639
me anymore so yeah that

7167.119 --> 7173.04
that pisses me off feel disrespected

7170.639 --> 7174.639
he's had issues before i'm not going to

7173.04 --> 7177.92
share them

7174.639 --> 7179.679
right that's his own private issues

7177.92 --> 7181.04
and i helped him with that and i gave

7179.679 --> 7184.2390000000005
him advice and he

7181.04 --> 7185.199
supported me he supported me emotionally

7184.239 --> 7188.5599999999995
when i needed it

7185.199 --> 7191.839999999999
right that's not too long ago but now

7188.56 --> 7194.639
he's just he's he's acting

7191.84 --> 7197.84
very creepy it's creeping me out and i

7194.639 --> 7199.28
want him to stop i want him to just stop

7197.84 --> 7202.8
acting

7199.28 --> 7205.679
like i am this weirdo freak that needs

7202.8 --> 7207.84
special approach and that is supposedly

7205.679 --> 7209.599
in his mind trying to blackmail him or

7207.84 --> 7210.8
something i don't know what the [ __ ]

7209.599 --> 7212.4800000000005
he's doing anymore

7210.8 --> 7226.639
i just want him to act like a normal

7212.48 --> 7229.04
human being to me

7226.639 --> 7230.96
it could take some time okay well maybe

7229.04 --> 7233.679
that's it maybe it's just

7230.96 --> 7235.76
i i just like i'm pissed off because i'm

7233.679 --> 7237.28
used to be able that he's there

7235.76 --> 7239.04
and we're just communicating and now

7237.28 --> 7240.639
he's just acting like this and he's like

7239.04 --> 7244.48
what the [ __ ] are you doing

7240.639 --> 7247.52
this is like really pissing me off

7244.48 --> 7248.239
really pissing me off good servant and i

7247.52 --> 7250.639
don't care

7248.239 --> 7252.32
i don't care you don't have a good

7250.639 --> 7256.4800000000005
reason to act like this

7252.32 --> 7259.28
at all at all better to just silence

7256.48 --> 7260.159
than to do it like that it makes no

7259.28 --> 7263.36
sense

7260.159 --> 7265.04
get a grip for real get a grip

7263.36 --> 7266.88
i know it's tough but you got to get a

7265.04 --> 7268.56
grip this is

7266.88 --> 7270.32
unreasonable you may be suffering

7268.56 --> 7272.96
through all kinds of things

7270.32 --> 7274.719
i get it i have that too sometimes but

7272.96 --> 7277.679
this attitude

7274.719 --> 7278.96
that you've built towards me is to me

7277.679 --> 7282.0
unacceptable

7278.96 --> 7284.639
under any circumstances just say you're

7282.0 --> 7285.52
weak say you're fragile i'll i'll shut

7284.639 --> 7288.639
the [ __ ] up

7285.52 --> 7289.599
i'll refrain from judgment i will

7288.639 --> 7292.32
refrain from

7289.599 --> 7293.599
being angry in your face about other

7292.32 --> 7298.799999999999
things too

7293.599 --> 7298.8
but this act is just it is unacceptable

7300.56 --> 7304.719
i i refuse to deal with that i will not

7302.88 --> 7308.84
be

7304.719 --> 7311.76
treated like that it's just

7308.84 --> 7312.159000000001
communication normal communication you

7311.76 --> 7315.119000000001
don't

7312.159 --> 7317.199
delete every freaking sentence you say

7315.119 --> 7320.5599999999995
afterward

7317.199 --> 7320.879999999999
it's unacceptable and don't care what

7320.56 --> 7323.119000000001
you

7320.88 --> 7325.119
think the reason for that is there is no

7323.119 --> 7325.839999999999
good reason for it any reason that you

7325.119 --> 7329.44
think of

7325.84 --> 7331.04
to do that is not reasonable cannot be

7329.44 --> 7333.759999999999
it's illogical

7331.04 --> 7335.199
there's no reason for it because

7333.76 --> 7337.119000000001
everything's going to be registered

7335.199 --> 7337.759999999999
anyway there's no secrets you can keep

7337.119 --> 7339.598999999999
anyway

7337.76 --> 7341.280000000001
if you think you can then you're misled

7339.599 --> 7342.08
about that you shouldn't worry about

7341.28 --> 7345.119
that you know

7342.08 --> 7347.92
better you should trust god and

7345.119 --> 7348.239
stop feeding whatever that weird thing

7347.92 --> 7353.84
is

7348.239 --> 7353.839999999999
that that's driving you right now

7364.84 --> 7368.719
uh

7366.56 --> 7370.2390000000005
yeah and i'm not talking about medical

7368.719 --> 7371.84
history just

7370.239 --> 7374.08
saying things that he's literally

7371.84 --> 7376.56
confessed live on air on his own show

7374.08 --> 7376.5599999999995
and everything

7379.119 --> 7386.08
wow rufus mr

7382.639 --> 7394.56
oh i got something to judge him on

7386.08 --> 7409.84
like a troll with a no life right

7394.56 --> 7409.84
try doing that again

7426.639 --> 7430.639
right but yeah my issue mainly is like

7429.679 --> 7432.8
okay if

7430.639 --> 7435.599
a good servant is like literally in a

7432.8 --> 7438.159000000001
really bad spot in his mind

7435.599 --> 7439.52
this should literally just say it and

7438.159 --> 7442.96
not

7439.52 --> 7446.88
[ __ ] delete it say it leave

7442.96 --> 7450.4
the words there and step away

7446.88 --> 7451.92
so that it is said and then i know it's

7450.4 --> 7455.679
there i can move on

7451.92 --> 7459.04
i can just give him his time his face

7455.679 --> 7459.04
but yeah it's just

7460.32 --> 7464.079
maybe it's all just worse than i thought

7462.48 --> 7465.759999999999
with him

7464.079 --> 7467.759999999999
but i've never seen him act like this

7465.76 --> 7471.0
before ever and i know

7467.76 --> 7474.17
i know i've known good servant for years

[ __ ] he doesn't want to burden anyone i

7491.76 --> 7495.52
don't give a [ __ ]

7493.52 --> 7497.76
i don't give a [ __ ] that he doesn't want

7495.52 --> 7499.679
to do that i just want him

7497.76 --> 7501.280000000001
to have normal communication and if it's

7499.679 --> 7503.76
so bad

7501.28 --> 7506.079
then just don't mention it at all if

7503.76 --> 7508.4800000000005
it's so terrible don't tell anybody

7506.079 --> 7509.44
i don't want to burn just don't talk

7508.48 --> 7511.759999999999

don't talk about it i don't give a [ __ ]

7513.679 --> 7517.76
what he

7514.32 --> 7519.679
sizes up as a burden okay

7517.76 --> 7521.76
yeah it's gonna be a terrible burden to

7519.679 --> 7522.719
him he doesn't know what it's going to

7521.76 --> 7524.8
be to us

7522.719 --> 7525.92
he doesn't have the ability right now to

7524.8 --> 7529.599
judge that

7525.92 --> 7529.599
so i don't even want to hear about that

7530.719 --> 7537.44
keep it to yourself or you don't don't

7534.48 --> 7538.079

7764.56 --> 7767.4400000000005
wasn't working

7765.84 --> 7769.04
from what i heard it like literally i'm

7767.44 --> 7769.839999999999
not gonna explain it it just wasn't

7769.04 --> 7773.36
working

7769.84 --> 7774.96
like that like the communication wasn't

7773.36 --> 7776.4
gonna fix itself and i think that good

7774.96 --> 7779.44
servant did some made some good

7776.4 --> 7782.5599999999995
decisions i advised him on it

7779.44 --> 7785.44
i really helped him to to be stronger

7782.56 --> 7786.4800000000005
and i think he did great but now

7785.44 --> 7789.199
apparently

7786.48 --> 7790.32
i don't know it's just he lost it and i

7789.199 --> 7792.239
don't know why

7790.32 --> 7794.0
that he won't communicate and he's just

7792.239 --> 7795.5199999999995
whining i do when you're beauty you go

7794.0 --> 7796.8
[ __ ] yourself i don't give a [ __ ] you

7795.52 --> 7798.4800000000005
don't want to burn me

7796.8 --> 7801.28
why don't you just [ __ ] inform me

7798.48 --> 7803.759999999999
already stop leaving me in the dark and

7801.28 --> 7805.04
stop making stupid side excuses i don't

7803.76 --> 7809.360000000001
give a [ __ ]

7805.04 --> 7812.159
what you don't want to burden me with ok

7809.36 --> 7815.119
i mean it shut the [ __ ] up don't say

7812.159 --> 7817.598999999999
that again i don't care

7815.119 --> 7819.36
for your pity about secrets you're

7817.599 --> 7822.56
keeping because you think i can't handle

7819.36 --> 7822.5599999999995
it i don't give a [ __ ]

7827.599 --> 7832.32
hey absolute flutters vodka good to see

7830.079 --> 7832.32
you

7841.679 --> 7846.96
i have peace in those situations because

7843.679 --> 7850.2390000000005
i source my reliance on god

7846.96 --> 7851.28
i don't know what that means exactly i'm

7850.239 --> 7853.759999999999
just saying

7851.28 --> 7856.159
i don't give a [ __ ] i think it's a

7853.76 --> 7858.400000000001
stupid excuse what he's making

7856.159 --> 7859.28
it's basic it almost is it's almost

7858.4 --> 7863.04
getting to

7859.28 --> 7866.719
the point where it's a lie see

7863.04 --> 7869.36
and i find that utterly unacceptable

7866.719 --> 7870.8
rather to completely shut the [ __ ] up

7869.36 --> 7873.839999999999
forever

7870.8 --> 7876.0
then to start spouting nonsense like

7873.84 --> 7878.32
i'm afraid i don't want to burden you

7876.0 --> 7881.679
that's [ __ ] you

7878.32 --> 7883.599
[ __ ] you who the [ __ ] are you to tell me

7881.679 --> 7885.4400000000005
that [ __ ] after everything we've been

7883.599 --> 7888.079
through

7885.44 --> 7888.48
like i'm weak who the [ __ ] do you think

7888.079 --> 7892.079
you are

7888.48 --> 7893.759999999999
dude if you would literally be drowning

7892.079 --> 7896.639
in horrific

7893.76 --> 7899.280000000001
literal like torturous torture dungeon

7896.639 --> 7902.0
nightmare visions constantly

7899.28 --> 7902.96
yeah if you would tell me i could handle

7902.0 --> 7905.44
that

7902.96 --> 7907.199
literally i can handle that right so

7905.44 --> 7909.5199999999995
there's nothing that you can

7907.199 --> 7910.48
conceive of that i would not be able to

7909.52 --> 7912.88
handle

7910.48 --> 7914.959999999999
so it's just arrogant it's just arrogant

7912.88 --> 7916.8
to say like oh you can't help who the

7914.96 --> 7917.84
[ __ ] are you to tell me i can't handle

7916.8 --> 7920.079000000001
that

7917.84 --> 7921.4400000000005
right not saying you should be throwing

7920.079 --> 7924.0
it out in public

7921.44 --> 7925.5199999999995
but you could just share it with me it's

7924.0 --> 7941.84
unacceptable

7925.52 --> 7941.84
to me and that's just the way it is

7952.84 --> 7955.84
right

7957.52 --> 7963.1990000000005
i was when i was in psychosis i could

7960.96 --> 7966.2390000000005
only count on god for healing

7963.199 --> 7967.44
during my 10 years in prison yes of

7966.239 --> 7970.4
course

7967.44 --> 7970.4
it's always like that

7971.84 --> 7976.96
or it should be for me too you know when

7975.04 --> 7979.04
i have a nervous breakdown because i

7976.96 --> 7981.28
sometimes have that the stress becomes

7979.04 --> 7981.679
too much and i get paranoid in a moment

7981.28 --> 7987.04
it's like

7981.679 --> 7989.119
help yeah god on my knees

7987.04 --> 7990.56
weeping please forgive me please forgive

7989.119 --> 7992.5599999999995
me god please forgive me god it doesn't

7990.56 --> 7994.320000000001
make any sense i didn't do anything

7992.56 --> 7996.8
but that doesn't matter it's just like

7994.32 --> 8000.88
please forgive me please forgive me

7996.8 --> 8000.88
and yeah that works

8001.679 --> 8012.88
so i get that totally

8010.0 --> 8012.88
her point is

8013.679 --> 8025.84
okay right

8034.0 --> 8039.44
right anyway whatever it is whatever it

8036.96 --> 8041.04
is i hope it's just in his mind

8039.44 --> 8043.44
whatever it is i hope he gets out of it

8041.04 --> 8044.4
and he just comes back at some point

8043.44 --> 8047.919999999999
acting like a

8044.4 --> 8048.799999999999
normal person again because this is just

8047.92 --> 8051.4400000000005
sad

8048.8 --> 8053.4400000000005
it makes me sad i feel like i'm losing a

8051.44 --> 8056.0
friend

8053.44 --> 8057.199
and then he makes these silly comments

8056.0 --> 8059.199
and it's just stupid

8057.199 --> 8060.799999999999
it's like i don't want to hear that [ __ ]

8059.199 --> 8061.839999999999
why don't you just start acting normal

8060.8 --> 8064.2390000000005
again

8061.84 --> 8064.88
and share the burden and i don't give a

8064.239 --> 8067.36
[ __ ]

8064.88 --> 8068.0
that you might think or believe it's too

8067.36 --> 8070.32
much for

8068.0 --> 8071.599
no no no it might be too much for you

8070.32 --> 8073.679
why don't you stick to

8071.599 --> 8075.28
you it's too much for you don't say that

8073.679 --> 8078.8
it's too much for me

8075.28 --> 8079.5199999999995
don't tell me that i can't handle it

8078.8 --> 8082.320000000001
ever

8079.52 --> 8083.4400000000005
ever you don't know if i can't handle

8082.32 --> 8086.799999999999
i'll tell you

8083.44 --> 8087.36
right the first things roll out and i

8086.8 --> 8090.88
notice

8087.36 --> 8093.92
oh god this is too much i'll tell you

8090.88 --> 8095.679
don't don't freaking judge for me what i

8093.92 --> 8098.88
can handle what i can

8095.679 --> 8100.2390000000005
ever i can handle more than most people

8098.88 --> 8103.52
could

8100.239 --> 8109.839999999999
possibly imagine if i'm

8103.52 --> 8109.84
willing to all right

8119.119 --> 8123.598999999999
okay i heard some stories yesterday from

8121.28 --> 8126.5599999999995
samsung which i'm not going to even hint

8123.599 --> 8129.679
exactly what that is that were

8126.56 --> 8130.400000000001
that almost broke my mind like tragedy

8129.679 --> 8133.92
that's just

8130.4 --> 8137.36
unbelievable right

8133.92 --> 8139.119
i can handle that it was shocking

8137.36 --> 8140.719
but i could handle that and now it

8139.119 --> 8142.96
actually made me stronger and

8140.719 --> 8145.119
it helped us bond get a better

8142.96 --> 8148.56
understanding even

8145.119 --> 8152.719
i know more where samson's coming from

8148.56 --> 8156.4800000000005
right because i can handle it and he

8152.719 --> 8158.32
trusted that he did not say i don't want

8156.48 --> 8161.5199999999995
to burden you

8158.32 --> 8164.799999999999
please don't talk to me i can't handle

8161.52 --> 8167.280000000001
i can't face it no no he just

8164.8 --> 8169.679
trusted me and he just told it exactly

8167.28 --> 8171.5199999999995
like it was i was shocked he said i'm

8169.679 --> 8174.8
sorry i said don't be sorry it's just

8171.52 --> 8177.119000000001
that i didn't expect it

8174.8 --> 8178.639
and then we talked about it and we

8177.119 --> 8181.679
resolved it and we

8178.639 --> 8182.079
both gave it a new place that's what you

8181.679 --> 8184.96
do

8182.079 --> 8185.599
that's how you fix problems you don't

8184.96 --> 8187.599
cower

8185.599 --> 8190.56
and fantasize about how other people

8187.599 --> 8193.84
can't handle you anymore

8190.56 --> 8193.84
it's just a lie

8207.679 --> 8213.599
soft pet bunny they make water for calm

8211.2 --> 8217.519
pets yeah and they leave poop everywhere

8213.599 --> 8221.84
also you know bunnies are really cute

8217.519 --> 8221.84
but without a garden it sucks

8223.519 --> 8226.960000000001
bunnies need gardens i'd love to have a

8226.16 --> 8230.88
bunny again

8226.96 --> 8230.88
but i will definitely need a garden

8231.12 --> 8239.76
a bunny and a cat

8235.12 --> 8239.76
and it's gonna be great i love it

8241.439 --> 8247.599
oh yeah and chickens bunny cat

8244.88 --> 8250.08
chicken that's that those are my

8247.599 --> 8250.08
favorites

8251.12 --> 8258.08
tastes like ah that's that's grim

8254.24 --> 8260.96
not for eating i just have the chicken

8258.08 --> 8262.559
for maybe for eggs but at first just to

8260.96 --> 8264.8
have chickens because i also kind of

8262.559 --> 8267.119999999999
like chickens

8264.8 --> 8268.119999999999
i i don't know i think that chickens are

8267.12 --> 8271.12
highly

8268.12 --> 8271.12
underestimated

8274.559 --> 8279.358999999999
large aquariums full of tropical fish

8276.96 --> 8279.358999999999
all right

8280.479 --> 8284.639
i like staring at them sometimes i don't

8282.96 --> 8286.719
like having them though

8284.639 --> 8288.96
i do appreciate it when i look at

8286.719 --> 8291.119999999999
somebody else who has those but

8288.96 --> 8293.919999999998
i myself don't i'm not really like an

8291.12 --> 8293.92
aquarium guy

8298.319 --> 8301.84
i don't know i think it would be much

8300.16 --> 8304.399
more interesting to have like a

8301.84 --> 8306.319
pond you know if you've got a big swath

8304.399 --> 8308.96
of land you got a house

8306.319 --> 8311.199999999999
you can have a farm on there it would be

8308.96 --> 8312.96
i would really be like oh man i want to

8311.2 --> 8315.2
dig a pond

8312.96 --> 8316.24
like a big one and then put carpets in

8315.2 --> 8318.0
it

8316.24 --> 8320.24
and then just let them do their thing

8318.0 --> 8322.08
until like one day decide like let's go

8320.24 --> 8325.28
fish and then you get like

8322.08 --> 8330.479
[ __ ] fish out of there this is

8325.28 --> 8332.479000000001
that's that's what i like

8330.479 --> 8333.92
about with water but it's got to be wild

8332.479 --> 8337.039999999999
it's good just got to be wild

8333.92 --> 8337.599
full of lilies and all that that's

8337.04 --> 8339.92
awesome

8337.599 --> 8341.2
like a moat like a moat around the

8339.92 --> 8343.04
castle now of course i'm not going to

8341.2 --> 8345.519
have a castle anytime soon

8343.04 --> 8347.519
but yeah castles have moats and then

8345.519 --> 8349.04
those moats are filled with liddies and

8347.519 --> 8353.679
carpers

8349.04 --> 8361.84
and that's awesome freshwater jellyfish

8353.679 --> 8361.84
okay that's very tropical [ __ ]

8365.439 --> 8369.2
okay okay well to reach your own i look

8368.0 --> 8373.519
i'm never going to be

8369.2 --> 8375.76
an aquarium guy like that but i get it

8373.519 --> 8378.08
it can be pretty pretty very pretty to

8375.76 --> 8378.08
look at

8381.599 --> 8385.679
no end to food supply right right george

8384.479 --> 8389.199999999999
sanford isn't it

8385.679 --> 8392.0
isn't that amazing carpets are just

8389.2 --> 8392.720000000001
very special creatures and they clean up

8392.0 --> 8396.08
the water

8392.72 --> 8398.0
they clean it up awesome

8396.08 --> 8399.68
you can just leave them there and just

8398.0 --> 8401.04
like 10 years later you come back and

8399.68 --> 8403.52
suddenly there's like these

8401.04 --> 8405.92
giant massive fish in there it's super

8403.52 --> 8405.92
awesome

8407.6 --> 8414.880000000001
terrariums lizards yeah yeah

8412.64 --> 8418.0
i know somebody that has that she's

8414.88 --> 8420.16
really like into snakes

8418.0 --> 8423.04
like these cute snakes that are

8420.16 --> 8423.039999999999
non-toxic

8424.479 --> 8431.84
it's not my thing

8432.319 --> 8435.519999999999
i'm i'm really much more about furry

8434.399 --> 8438.96
creatures

8435.52 --> 8441.84
i i just like cats i think bunnies are

8438.96 --> 8441.839999999998
extremely cute

8442.0 --> 8447.12
and yeah maybe a chicken

8445.28 --> 8448.479000000001
maybe some fish in a pond that that

8447.12 --> 8451.12
would be ideal for me

8448.479 --> 8452.72
to have that all combined and then like

8451.12 --> 8456.0
all these creatures together

8452.72 --> 8457.358999999999
figuring it out like maybe some point

8456.0 --> 8459.92
the cat's gonna get boring he's gonna

8457.359 --> 8462.16
chase after the chicken right

8459.92 --> 8463.2
and maybe some point he's just gonna sit

8462.16 --> 8466.8
next to the bunny

8463.2 --> 8469.2
like why is the bunny not running away

8466.8 --> 8471.119999999999
and just i'm curiou these interactions

8469.2 --> 8473.84
or like the cat just trying to catch a

8471.12 --> 8473.84
fish

8474.319 --> 8487.84
that's that yeah i like that

8494.04 --> 8501.84
plant-based beef what that's not beef

8498.88 --> 8501.839999999998
no i have not

8512.479 --> 8516.72
which came first the chicken or the egg

8514.479 --> 8516.72
uh

8517.2 --> 8520.240000000002
i'd say the chicken

8520.88 --> 8525.039999999999
say the first creature because if

8523.12 --> 8525.76
evolution is not there it's creation so

8525.04 --> 8528.880000000001
i'd say that

8525.76 --> 8532.64
the first off the first creation would

8528.88 --> 8535.119999999999
just be a fully formed version and then

8532.64 --> 8536.319
after reproduction cycle has been

8535.12 --> 8538.240000000002
initiated

8536.319 --> 8540.319
that's when the eggs come out so i'd say

8538.24 --> 8540.56
absolutely the chicken i know it's not

8540.319 --> 8542.72
an

8540.56 --> 8544.56
answer you're supposed to give but that

8542.72 --> 8546.479
is my actual conclusion

8544.56 --> 8548.0
completely breaking that whole stupid

8546.479 --> 8549.76
game right

8548.0 --> 8552.319
chicken earlier yeah the chicken was

8549.76 --> 8556.319
first it's always first

8552.319 --> 8558.08
because that is the first design

8556.319 --> 8561.119999999999
and then after reproduction starts up

8558.08 --> 8561.12
that's when the eggs come

8562.08 --> 8565.68
no he didn't he did not make the egg

8563.84 --> 8568.08
first what's going to hatch the egg

8565.68 --> 8571.84
what's going to imprint onto the egg

8568.08 --> 8574.16
what it's going to be nothing

8571.84 --> 8575.84
the chicken would have to be first or it

8574.16 --> 8578.56
could never have

8575.84 --> 8578.56
started up

8579.52 --> 8586.800000000001
nobody's going to raise an infant

8583.439 --> 8587.76
without anything er an infant's not

8586.8 --> 8590.0
gonna raise

8587.76 --> 8592.479
and wisen up itself the fully formed

8590.0 --> 8594.56
creature would have to be there first

8592.479 --> 8596.0
or it could never survive as a

8594.56 --> 8597.84
reproduction cycle

8596.0 --> 8599.68
it could never imprint what it is

8597.84 --> 8602.319
actually like to be a chicken

8599.68 --> 8602.880000000001
onto the developing fetus it could not

8602.319 --> 8604.88
do that

8602.88 --> 8607.199999999999
if it was not there present so the

8604.88 --> 8609.839999999998
chicken would absolutely always have to

8607.2 --> 8612.240000000002
be fully formed there first

8609.84 --> 8614.08
or it could never have survived and that

8612.24 --> 8618.479
counts for all things

8614.08 --> 8622.399
for all creatures starts with the fully

8618.479 --> 8625.679999999998
shaped perfected design living

8622.399 --> 8628.72
animated as is in a perfect state that's

8625.68 --> 8631.439
always first always every time

8628.72 --> 8633.92
because otherwise it could not survive

8631.439 --> 8636.399
because it could not be able to imprint

8633.92 --> 8637.12
what it is like to be a fully formed

8636.399 --> 8639.358999999999
creature

8637.12 --> 8640.399000000001
onto the developing offspring which is

8639.359 --> 8644.0
required

8640.399 --> 8645.84
it's required that a parent is present

8644.0 --> 8648.0
with the offspring in order to have a

8645.84 --> 8650.479
spiritual imprint onto the

8648.0 --> 8652.0
developing creature so that it knows

8650.479 --> 8655.279999999999
what it's going to be

8652.0 --> 8669.84
because if it doesn't it's gonna die

8655.28 --> 8669.84
yeah try to figure that one out

8670.24 --> 8674.02
[Music]

8680.479 --> 8685.519999999999
okay absolute flatter vodka that's not a

8682.479 --> 8685.519999999999
complete sentence

8687.84 --> 8691.12
and neither is that sir george sanford

8690.72 --> 8694.84
yes

8691.12 --> 8697.84
i have seems legit what that's not a

8694.84 --> 8697.84
sentence

8701.84 --> 8705.04
sunlight have you considered that the

8704.16 --> 8707.84
sunlight we

8705.04 --> 8708.240000000002
originates from here on earth what

8707.84 --> 8711.84
that's

8708.24 --> 8711.84
that's not english

8713.76 --> 8720.16
and no when you talk originate

8717.04 --> 8723.92
then you're obviously pointing at

8720.16 --> 8726.24
how we can make light here on earth with

8723.92 --> 8729.28
objects by electrifying them or

8726.24 --> 8730.88
by initiating a chemical reaction that

8729.28 --> 8732.479000000001
produces light right

8730.88 --> 8735.119999999999
that's not it that's the celestial

8732.479 --> 8737.679999999998
lights are not that they cannot be that

8735.12 --> 8738.240000000002
it is not originating from anywhere it's

8737.68 --> 8740.319
light

8738.24 --> 8743.039999999999
manifest it's not coming from anywhere

8740.319 --> 8745.039999999999
it's coming from that direction

8743.04 --> 8746.800000000001
and when you go into that direction then

8745.04 --> 8747.52
that direction from which that light is

8746.8 --> 8750.16
coming from

8747.52 --> 8751.76
changes it's non-localized light

8750.16 --> 8753.6
manifest

8751.76 --> 8755.359
it's not coming from anywhere not from

8753.6 --> 8759.12
earth not from up there

8755.359 --> 8762.399000000001
it's light manifest without a specific

8759.12 --> 8767.84
euclidean source and that's what it is

8762.399 --> 8767.84
you cannot prove anything else about it

8769.52 --> 8774.800000000001
so yeah yeah reflect of those are very

8772.8 --> 8776.24
very cute it's all very cute peachey

8774.8 --> 8778.08
ideas basically

8776.24 --> 8780.199999999999
it's not true there's no proof for this

8778.08 --> 8784.88
it's not reflecting of anything it's a

8780.2 --> 8784.880000000001
non-localized light manifest phenomenon

8786.08 --> 8790.88
it's not coming from anywhere when you

8788.399 --> 8791.279999999999
go into the angular direction from which

8790.88 --> 8794.64
the

8791.28 --> 8796.960000000001
light seems to come it bends away

8794.64 --> 8799.599999999999
pointing that it's not coming from a

8796.96 --> 8801.358999999999
literal local source

8799.6 --> 8802.640000000001
it's not coming from any physical

8801.359 --> 8806.56
position

8802.64 --> 8807.519999999999
it's just apparently there in an angular

8806.56 --> 8809.439
relation

8807.52 --> 8811.68
in relation to the observer and that's

8809.439 --> 8812.399
what it is and that's all it is it's not

8811.68 --> 8815.68
coming from

8812.399 --> 8816.399
anything it's manifest manifest out of

8815.68 --> 8820.399
nothing

8816.399 --> 8824.08
out of nothing energy manifesting

8820.399 --> 8827.279999999999
light outer nothing from not a source

8824.08 --> 8830.479
except the energy itself it manifests

8827.28 --> 8833.52
it leaves an angular phenomenon

8830.479 --> 8835.438999999998
on the observer that we see as celestial

8833.52 --> 8836.720000000001
dots of light or the sun disc or the

8835.439 --> 8838.800000000001
moon

8836.72 --> 8840.08
that is not an object that's a light

8838.8 --> 8843.519999999999
phenomenon

8840.08 --> 8847.2
side effect of light manifest

8843.52 --> 8850.800000000001
coming out of nothing a non-local

8847.2 --> 8853.68
light non-local source

8850.8 --> 8854.88
light manifest out of nothing nothing

8853.68 --> 8859.28
absolute nothing

8854.88 --> 8863.358999999999
not coming from a singular point at all

8859.28 --> 8866.08
yeah very frustrating isn't it

8863.359 --> 8866.08
it's what it is

8869.76 --> 8873.2
now it's not a reflection you can't

8871.52 --> 8875.68
prove that

8873.2 --> 8876.720000000001
you can't prove a reflection there is

8875.68 --> 8879.84
nothing

8876.72 --> 8882.64
it's simple you can't pinpoint a source

8879.84 --> 8883.439
why don't you go trace it back you'll be

8882.64 --> 8886.88
moving

8883.439 --> 8890.24
for all eternity because there is

8886.88 --> 8893.599999999999
no pinpointable literal source

8890.24 --> 8897.119999999999
through any mechanism of reflection

8893.6 --> 8900.2
or anything nothing you got

8897.12 --> 8903.92
nothing not a local

8900.2 --> 8907.28
pinpointable source location

8903.92 --> 8910.64
there isn't at all

8907.28 --> 8913.12
not even close so keep dreaming on

8910.64 --> 8914.8
about some reflection of a dome it's no

8913.12 --> 8919.12
proof for this whatsoever

8914.8 --> 8921.759999999998
what so ever no empirical proof

8919.12 --> 8923.359
no data actually actually backing up

8921.76 --> 8925.04
that idea

8923.359 --> 8926.880000000001
sure there's models there's

8925.04 --> 8928.960000000001
presuppositional models that you can

8926.88 --> 8930.96
build and then when you test that model

8928.96 --> 8932.16
yeah it kind of looks like it's short

8930.96 --> 8933.679999999998
off it's very cute

8932.16 --> 8936.0
but when you actually test it in the

8933.68 --> 8940.16
real world it doesn't

8936.0 --> 8942.72
at all so yeah there you go

8940.16 --> 8944.08
when what do we have we have light

8942.72 --> 8948.319
manifest

8944.08 --> 8952.479
light manifest out of nothing having

8948.319 --> 8956.0
celestial apparent discs as phenomenon

8952.479 --> 8959.039999999999
side effects to the light manifesting

8956.0 --> 8959.84
from a non-local location being absorbed

8959.04 --> 8963.04
by us

8959.84 --> 8966.399
from that angular direction generated

8963.04 --> 8967.04
by nothing nothing it's literally out of

8966.399 --> 8970.24
nothing

8967.04 --> 8971.439
light out of nothing nothing not a

8970.24 --> 8974.8
source it's there

8971.439 --> 8978.319
it arrives it comes from nothing

8974.8 --> 8981.358999999999
get it non-local light

8978.319 --> 8982.0
celestial light yeah it's very tough on

8981.359 --> 8984.479000000001
the brain

8982.0 --> 8986.88
very tough oh that physicality

8984.479 --> 8988.08
assumption buys it must be coming from a

8986.88 --> 8989.599999999999
thing it must be

8988.08 --> 8992.24
because that's the only thing that we

8989.6 --> 8994.08
can do every light we make has to come

8992.24 --> 8995.119999999999
from a point doesn't it from an object

8994.08 --> 8998.64
how can this be

8995.12 --> 9002.08
well it's there deal with it

8998.64 --> 9004.319
it's light manifesting out of nothing

9002.08 --> 9006.319
energy yeah feeds into the light

9004.319 --> 9008.88
absolutely there's a cycle

9006.319 --> 9011.439
it's not coming from a source it's not

9008.88 --> 9019.839999999998
coming from a point in space

9011.439 --> 9019.84
it's coming out of nothing

9023.76 --> 9027.2
yeah it's very cute very cute all those

9026.16 --> 9031.439
things very cute

9027.2 --> 9034.0
yeah yeah it's very cute though

9031.439 --> 9035.52
the celestial lights are still light

9034.0 --> 9039.12
manifest

9035.52 --> 9042.24
from non-sources non-specific points

9039.12 --> 9044.160000000002
non-actual points

9042.24 --> 9045.52
resulting in the conclusion they are

9044.16 --> 9048.24
literally manifesting

9045.52 --> 9049.84
out on nothing energy feeds into it

9048.24 --> 9050.88
because it has to it has energy it's

9049.84 --> 9054.0
being absorbed

9050.88 --> 9055.279999999999
but it's not coming from a location at

9054.0 --> 9058.479
all

9055.28 --> 9061.68
not a object not a piece of matter not

9058.479 --> 9065.119999999999
gases not plasma not anything it's

9061.68 --> 9068.880000000001
light manifesting out of

9065.12 --> 9075.84
nothing nothing

9068.88 --> 9075.839999999998
nothing deal with it

9081.439 --> 9084.960000000001
and there we go with the

9082.8 --> 9087.199999999999
presuppositional flatter squirting

9084.96 --> 9089.358999999999
there's a domestic price it proves it

9087.2 --> 9090.640000000001
always has to be a dome it's the only

9089.359 --> 9093.439
model

9090.64 --> 9096.24
ah the model it has to be a freaking

9093.439 --> 9100.08
disk with a dome it must be

9096.24 --> 9104.64
it must bury your disk with a dome

9100.08 --> 9110.56
it has to bury a disc with it down

9104.64 --> 9110.56
yeah it's very cute very very cute

9111.92 --> 9116.0
it's complete horseshit though just

9113.84 --> 9118.960000000001
fantasy speculation it's modeling it's

9116.0 --> 9121.439
playing with the legos in your mind of

9118.96 --> 9123.839999999998
something a model that you can

9121.439 --> 9125.52
get a grip on and then feel kind of like

9123.84 --> 9126.64
oh this is cool i can do something with

9125.52 --> 9128.880000000001
this it's very cute

9126.64 --> 9130.72
but guess what the real world is not as

9128.88 --> 9132.64
straightforward as that

9130.72 --> 9133.84
it's unfortunately much more surreal and

9132.64 --> 9136.0
confusing

9133.84 --> 9137.2
like literally celestial lights

9136.0 --> 9141.52
manifesting

9137.2 --> 9144.560000000001
from a non-local non-source

9141.52 --> 9146.08
out of nothing including all that

9144.56 --> 9149.439
all-powerful

9146.08 --> 9150.08
sunlight from that apparent disc that

9149.439 --> 9153.68
you see

9150.08 --> 9157.039999999999
in an angular relation manifesting out

9153.68 --> 9160.24
nothing not a source not a point

9157.04 --> 9161.6
euclidean point in space that is the

9160.24 --> 9164.64
origin of this light

9161.6 --> 9165.2
anywhere in any reflective setup or

9164.64 --> 9167.279999999999
anything

9165.2 --> 9170.399000000001
it's literally manifesting out of

9167.28 --> 9173.92
nothing all that power out of nothing

9170.399 --> 9175.76
yeah deal with it you can call it god

9173.92 --> 9177.76
you can call it god if you like because

9175.76 --> 9180.64
i have no other explanation

9177.76 --> 9181.359
it's manifesting out of nothing just

9180.64 --> 9183.84
like that

9181.359 --> 9184.640000000001
we cannot recreate this i cannot

9183.84 --> 9188.0
recreate it

9184.64 --> 9189.76
might be somebody can i cannot

9188.0 --> 9191.2
so as far as i'm concerned it's

9189.76 --> 9193.6
manifesting out of

9191.2 --> 9193.6
nothing

9198.399 --> 9201.84
no i'm not gonna look up any verse of

9199.92 --> 9203.68
the bible but if you want to

9201.84 --> 9206.64
paste it in the chat then go ahead i

9203.68 --> 9206.64
rama sandstone

9212.399 --> 9215.76
and i'm not going to make a rap but if

9214.0 --> 9216.399
somebody wants to make a rap with me

9215.76 --> 9219.52
saying

9216.399 --> 9223.84
manifesting out of nothing and a repeat

9219.52 --> 9227.68
loop then i'm fine with that like i'm

9223.84 --> 9230.8
the things i say are you may use them

9227.68 --> 9233.76
for creative purposes as long as you do

9230.8 --> 9234.399
share that you are going to use it i do

9233.76 --> 9238.800000000001
not lend

9234.399 --> 9241.76
my works to hostile scumbags

9238.8 --> 9242.64
for example just so you know if you want

9241.76 --> 9244.960000000001
to make something

9242.64 --> 9246.0
and use samples of things arwen said

9244.96 --> 9249.438999999998
that's fine

9246.0 --> 9250.0
just talk to me i'll probably just give

9249.439 --> 9256.800000000001
it to you

9250.0 --> 9259.12
just like that

9256.8 --> 9260.64
you want manifest money out of nothing

9259.12 --> 9263.04
you don't really do

9260.64 --> 9264.319
you know it's just gonna deflate the

9263.04 --> 9266.319000000001
worth of the value of

9264.319 --> 9268.84
all the other money so it's not really

9266.319 --> 9271.84
worth it manifesting money out of

9268.84 --> 9271.84
nothing

9276.77 --> 9279.959
[Music]

9284.319 --> 9288.56
space is not real well

9293.84 --> 9297.52
differences on the shape of the earth

9295.52 --> 9299.84
really so if you don't think the earth

9297.52 --> 9299.84
is flat

9299.92 --> 9303.359
i'm pretty sure it's flat there's no

9301.76 --> 9305.52
curvature

9303.359 --> 9306.56
and is there anything more we need to

9305.52 --> 9310.24
know

9306.56 --> 9315.84
sure the orientation of the land masses

9310.24 --> 9317.84
which are presumed to be a description

9315.84 --> 9319.68
for which there is no proof whatsoever

9317.84 --> 9321.52
there's no proof it's a disc

9319.68 --> 9323.28
and there's absolutely no proof of any

9321.52 --> 9326.479000000001
kind of physical

9323.28 --> 9326.880000000001
spheric demi sphere barrier there's no

9326.479 --> 9328.8
proof

9326.88 --> 9330.64
the only proof we have is that there is

9328.8 --> 9332.08
containment because we breathe gas

9330.64 --> 9335.279999999999
pressure

9332.08 --> 9339.28
and that the earth is flat

9335.28 --> 9342.319000000001
that's what we got that's the data

9339.28 --> 9344.560000000001
we have collected that can be

9342.319 --> 9345.359
cross-referenced and that's the data we

9344.56 --> 9347.76
have

9345.359 --> 9349.52
it's really not that much of data right

9347.76 --> 9351.6
we don't know the orientation of the

9349.52 --> 9354.24
land masses in the ocean bottoms

9351.6 --> 9356.0
there's a lot of speculation about it

9354.24 --> 9356.8
but as far as i'm concerned there's not

9356.0 --> 9360.0
even proof

9356.8 --> 9362.319
that it all is yeah linear

9360.0 --> 9363.76
that it's all interconnected spatially

9362.319 --> 9366.8
linear

9363.76 --> 9370.08
right and that makes it very confusing

9366.8 --> 9370.08
and i'm not going to then

9370.479 --> 9375.279999999999
manifest that as this is what it is i am

9373.52 --> 9376.720000000001
absolutely certain that space is

9375.28 --> 9378.319000000001
absolutely non-linear

9376.72 --> 9380.319
because i can't really prove it but i

9378.319 --> 9383.6
have suspicions

9380.319 --> 9387.359
and i have devised methods to falsify

9383.6 --> 9390.16
whether space is entirely linear

9387.359 --> 9392.16
in this realm and how that would work

9390.16 --> 9392.479
i've devised a method to figure that out

9392.16 --> 9396.08
and

9392.479 --> 9399.279999999999
potentially falsify disprove it to be

9396.08 --> 9401.6
the case right so i have potential

9399.28 --> 9403.92
progress for us to figure out

9401.6 --> 9405.359
but the more i talk about just the

9403.92 --> 9407.12
orientation of the realm the more i'm

9405.359 --> 9411.439
pretty convinced that the earth is

9407.12 --> 9414.399000000001
absolutely not a literal

9411.439 --> 9415.439
spatially literal disc as the what is it

9414.399 --> 9418.0
the gleason map

9415.439 --> 9420.720000000001
says it is like that it's not literally

9418.0 --> 9423.2
that not at all

9420.72 --> 9424.16
at all like that's not the way it's all

9423.2 --> 9426.08
divided

9424.16 --> 9427.359
there's there's just a whole bunch of

9426.08 --> 9430.0
things wrong with that

9427.359 --> 9433.12
it's not literal that it can't be

9430.0 --> 9433.12
doesn't make any sense

9433.52 --> 9436.800000000001
in the sense that it doesn't really

9435.76 --> 9438.960000000001
match

9436.8 --> 9441.199999999999
it does not match perfectly it's

9438.96 --> 9445.199999999999
probably the closest we could get to

9441.2 --> 9448.479000000001
having ever a spatially

9445.2 --> 9453.2
linear rep attempt to represent the

9448.479 --> 9456.24
earth realm surface perhaps

9453.2 --> 9459.04
it is a good attempt but it

9456.24 --> 9459.6
it cannot be that literally it's just no

9459.04 --> 9463.439
way

9459.6 --> 9466.24
it's just no no proof of this yet people

9463.439 --> 9468.960000000001
hang on to that at all times yeah and i

9466.24 --> 9472.72
have not smoked at all in your band

9468.96 --> 9475.199999999999
scumbag try to derail me

9472.72 --> 9475.199999999999
[ __ ] you

9478.84 --> 9481.68
right

9480.08 --> 9483.84
have you considered that the moon is a

9481.68 --> 9487.2
hologram yeah

9483.84 --> 9489.68
it is all of the celestial lights are

9487.2 --> 9492.319000000001
the sun is but i don't call it a

9489.68 --> 9496.24
hologram because that triggers people

9492.319 --> 9498.399
saying that oh that means device and no

9496.24 --> 9500.16
we make a device it doesn't look like

9498.399 --> 9502.16
that hologram

9500.16 --> 9504.24
no no it's holographic i just call it

9502.16 --> 9507.28
it's holographic that means

9504.24 --> 9509.68
light based the phenomenon

9507.28 --> 9512.399000000001
is light based and that's the only thing

9509.68 --> 9515.52
we can prove about it and any notion

9512.399 --> 9516.16
that comes with physicality seems to be

9515.52 --> 9518.479000000001
lacking

9516.16 --> 9520.24
there's no approachability there's no

9518.479 --> 9523.84
perspective applying

9520.24 --> 9525.52
to like approaching it or attempting to

9523.84 --> 9526.72
approaching it all these factors are

9525.52 --> 9529.04
missing

9526.72 --> 9530.88
there's only one type of thing out there

9529.04 --> 9534.240000000002
that we know

9530.88 --> 9536.8
that also has those traits of

9534.24 --> 9538.64
the missing ability to approach it the

9536.8 --> 9539.84
angular size not increasing when you

9538.64 --> 9542.479
attempt to approach it

9539.84 --> 9543.64
it bending away as you move towards it

9542.479 --> 9547.119999999999
and those are

9543.64 --> 9549.519999999999
holographics light based

9547.12 --> 9551.6
phenomenon that are holographic in

9549.52 --> 9554.960000000001
nature we can conjure that into like

9551.6 --> 9556.399000000001
3d images where you cross-eyed and then

9554.96 --> 9558.64
you get that effect

9556.399 --> 9560.56
that also falls under holographic pure

9558.64 --> 9563.199999999999
light-based effects

9560.56 --> 9565.68
so my conclusion was the celestial

9563.2 --> 9566.16
objects the apparent object is almost

9565.68 --> 9568.56
like

9566.16 --> 9570.16
wrong to say an object all the celestial

9568.56 --> 9572.24
light-based phenomena on the sun the

9570.16 --> 9576.08
moon the stars the planets all of it

9572.24 --> 9576.88
it's all celestial it is holographic in

9576.08 --> 9580.479
nature

9576.88 --> 9582.88
light only based

9580.479 --> 9584.24
those are not objects those are the

9582.88 --> 9588.319
appearance

9584.24 --> 9592.16
of lights to observer

9588.319 --> 9595.359
and it cannot be explained how it's just

9592.16 --> 9598.56
there and there cannot be an

9595.359 --> 9599.439
origin trace as to how it is manifesting

9598.56 --> 9602.96
like that

9599.439 --> 9606.08
it just is and the natural conclusion

9602.96 --> 9608.8
there has to be energy that is feeding

9606.08 --> 9609.359
that light manifest because any light is

9608.8 --> 9612.0
energy

9609.359 --> 9613.68
it costs energy light cannot just

9612.0 --> 9614.88
manifest out of nothing so there has to

9613.68 --> 9617.439
be some kind of

9614.88 --> 9618.56
thing it's lending this energy from and

9617.439 --> 9621.12
i have

9618.56 --> 9622.0
speculated that this is the electric

9621.12 --> 9624.479000000001
ether

9622.0 --> 9626.96
that actually feeds into the celestial

9624.479 --> 9630.88
light and this could be tested

9626.96 --> 9632.72
regionally so i'm interested

9630.88 --> 9634.0
to see if that's ever going to happen at

9632.72 --> 9635.76
some point

9634.0 --> 9637.84
it could be tested that if you're going

9635.76 --> 9640.16
to tap into

9637.84 --> 9641.92
the electric ether like atmospheric

9640.16 --> 9644.56
electricity as they call it

9641.92 --> 9648.16
if you tap a lot into it like a lot of

9644.56 --> 9651.199999999999
antennas up there that literally

9648.16 --> 9654.0
into that power that maybe

9651.2 --> 9655.76
when you do that the celestial lights

9654.0 --> 9657.92
die down

9655.76 --> 9660.64
they will literally dim the stars will

9657.92 --> 9663.92
maybe not be visible even at some point

9660.64 --> 9667.358999999999
maybe the sun light will even be weaker

9663.92 --> 9669.04
when you do that locally not a hundred

9667.359 --> 9671.04
miles away where there aren't all these

9669.04 --> 9673.12
antennas tapping into this energy but

9671.04 --> 9674.319000000001
locally like where you tap into the

9673.12 --> 9677.04
electric ether

9674.319 --> 9677.6
and tap energy out of it that literally

9677.04 --> 9680.319000000001
that might

9677.6 --> 9681.279
directly result in the dimming of the

9680.319 --> 9684.72
celestial light

9681.279 --> 9686.960000000001
including the sun that is my theory

9684.72 --> 9689.519999999999
about that and it can be tested of

9686.96 --> 9693.199999999999
course do we want to test it

9689.52 --> 9696.800000000001
i don't know maybe we don't but

9693.2 --> 9698.319000000001
it is the only model conceptual model

9696.8 --> 9700.64
for the whole works

9698.319 --> 9702.479
that kind of makes sense and results in

9700.64 --> 9705.84
kind of a balanced equation

9702.479 --> 9708.24
so that's it considered writing a book

9705.84 --> 9710.0
yay yeah of course consider it it's

9708.24 --> 9713.199999999999
never gonna happen though

9710.0 --> 9715.04
it's too much it's like i'm already

9713.2 --> 9716.560000000001
having so much trouble just explaining

9715.04 --> 9719.84
how i'm gonna write it down

9716.56 --> 9719.84
it's just i've tried

9720.24 --> 9723.68
every time i'll write down something

9722.0 --> 9724.479
it's immediately going to be outdated

9723.68 --> 9727.04
and i'll find

9724.479 --> 9729.519999999999
another way to say it it's it's tough

9727.04 --> 9729.92
you know maybe eventually at the end of

9729.52 --> 9731.76
my

9729.92 --> 9733.04
wizards journey for to figure out the

9731.76 --> 9734.72
cosmogenic i will

9733.04 --> 9736.399000000001
write down an entire book about it and

9734.72 --> 9737.599999999999
i'll know exactly how to i don't know

9736.399 --> 9740.96
how to at this moment

9737.6 --> 9747.84
i'm just gonna be explaining it

9740.96 --> 9747.839999999998
to people and hope they get it

9750.24 --> 9753.359
but hey if you like my work as a

9751.92 --> 9755.04
cosmogenist

9753.359 --> 9756.640000000001
and not just me complaining about

9755.04 --> 9758.479000000001
computer games that don't work for one

9756.64 --> 9761.92
and a half hours straight

9758.479 --> 9764.24
then yeah please do support me through

9761.92 --> 9766.88
the paypal patreon the super chat and

9764.24 --> 9770.399
the membership system join button

9766.88 --> 9774.319
that is needed it keeps me going

9770.399 --> 9776.08
it is what fuels me and this ability

9774.319 --> 9778.16
that i'm utilizing

9776.08 --> 9779.439
like that is the investment if you're

9778.16 --> 9779.92
going to invest in me you're going to

9779.439 --> 9782.880000000001
invest

9779.92 --> 9783.92
in me the cosmogenist that's actually

9782.88 --> 9788.479
working out

9783.92 --> 9790.72
the science haha pun intended

9788.479 --> 9792.399
but yeah hopefully at some point leading

9790.72 --> 9793.119999999999
to the scientific method level of

9792.399 --> 9795.199999999999
science

9793.12 --> 9797.12
but at least i'm modeling and i'm being

9795.2 --> 9803.84
very very serious and

9797.12 --> 9803.84
very minimalistic with the data

9809.279 --> 9811.52
what

9814.479 --> 9817.84
the [ __ ] are you serious

9828.84 --> 9831.84
really

9833.359 --> 9838.319
what why why can't i ban people

9838.88 --> 9843.119999999999
why can't i ban people that are just

9840.399 --> 9845.439
obviously disrespecting me

9843.12 --> 9847.279
so you're gonna destroy me now with what

9845.439 --> 9850.319
with my demons

9847.279 --> 9850.319000000001
how are you gonna do that

9850.399 --> 9854.479
so you're gonna make squirting videos

9852.479 --> 9857.119999999999
about me now in the back

9854.479 --> 9858.8
i've done nothing oh it shows me i'm a

9857.12 --> 9860.560000000001
coward why

9858.8 --> 9862.64
why because i want to have a normal

9860.56 --> 9864.72
conversation

9862.64 --> 9866.399
and not get disrupted by people that are

9864.72 --> 9869.119999999999
being disruptive and trolling

9866.399 --> 9869.119999999999
constantly

9869.6 --> 9875.6
what is this

9873.68 --> 9878.960000000001
how what are you going to expose about

9875.6 --> 9880.880000000001
me i'm a literal open book

9878.96 --> 9883.438999999998
can't be more [ __ ] open book than

9880.88 --> 9886.88
this guys what is wrong with you

9883.439 --> 9890.0
what demon what lies where's the lies

9886.88 --> 9890.0
what have i lied about

9890.08 --> 9893.68
right and it's not like oh you're gonna

9892.08 --> 9895.279
say something i'm gonna ban you because

9893.68 --> 9897.2
i'm afraid that people will see now why

9895.279 --> 9900.08
don't you just say it

9897.2 --> 9901.68
why don't you just say it i chose

9900.08 --> 9903.6
narcissism

9901.68 --> 9906.960000000001
oh and there we go again lies what what

9903.6 --> 9909.84
lies which lies exactly

9906.96 --> 9911.278999999999
can you share with me what lies because

9909.84 --> 9912.72
i don't know any

9911.279 --> 9915.04
if i got some lies i'd like to be

9912.72 --> 9917.92
pointed at it so i can potentially

9915.04 --> 9920.720000000001
correct myself apologize maybe

9917.92 --> 9921.6
right because i do that i do make

9920.72 --> 9923.278999999999
mistakes

9921.6 --> 9925.52
i've admitted i'm a human being i make

9923.279 --> 9929.6
mistakes and i do my best to learn from

9925.52 --> 9932.880000000001
them as well as i can

9929.6 --> 9932.880000000001
i'll come on your show

9933.12 --> 9936.800000000001
and then you can correct yourself okay

9935.76 --> 9940.0
all right

9936.8 --> 9943.759999999998
sure i'll come on your show that's fine

9940.0 --> 9944.88
this is like weird like expose me for my

9943.76 --> 9947.52
lies

9944.88 --> 9950.479
okay can you name one can you name one

they're saying

11007.12 --> 11011.6
this is our these are like a whole bunch

11009.279 --> 11014.640000000001
of people that are like

11011.6 --> 11016.640000000001
they've been waiting for years to find a

11014.64 --> 11020.0
way to somehow

11016.64 --> 11022.56
put a chain on me because they just want

11020.0 --> 11024.56

11030.96 --> 11035.278999999999
power

11031.52 --> 11037.52
this is unacceptable so yeah then they

11035.279 --> 11039.52
analyze every everything i've ever said

11037.52 --> 11041.6
to put it in a list and then like oh

11039.52 --> 11043.439
look that's that doesn't match he said

11041.6 --> 11044.319
that experience was then and now he says

11043.439 --> 11047.6
it was then

11044.319 --> 11050.399
so is he lying is he lying

11047.6 --> 11052.479000000001
am i sowing confusion on purpose by

11050.399 --> 11055.439
getting things wrong it makes me a liar

11052.479 --> 11055.438999999998

11056.56 --> 11060.24
i don't know earth pastor i literally

11058.319 --> 11063.359
don't know what's going on at this point

11060.24 --> 11065.68
this guy just came in here and says he's

11063.359 --> 11068.0
going to make a video exposing me for

11065.68 --> 11071.439
being a liar and

11068.0 --> 11073.359
it's it's really just weirding me out

11071.439 --> 11076.08
and he says that i have to come on his

11073.359 --> 11077.68
show to defend myself

11076.08 --> 11079.84
sounds very familiar you know there's a

11077.68 --> 11084.0
lot of other people that have done that

11079.84 --> 11088.479
too like george netanyuk

11084.0 --> 11090.479
simon dan jose

11088.479 --> 11092.319
all these people do that say like no no

11090.479 --> 11094.24
no you you're wrong

11092.319 --> 11095.68
why don't you come on us and we'll do it

11094.24 --> 11098.479
right right

11095.68 --> 11099.439
and then yeah well guess what's gonna

11098.479 --> 11102.56
happen

11099.439 --> 11105.52
i'm not just going to roll into

11102.56 --> 11106.88
somebody that literally watched in my

11105.52 --> 11110.960000000001
chat here and started

11106.88 --> 11113.599999999999
accusing me of being a liar

11110.96 --> 11115.519999999999
without an actual example he basically

11113.6 --> 11117.04
said yeah you got some things about your

11115.52 --> 11118.960000000001
visions and things wrong

11117.04 --> 11120.479000000001
right that doesn't make you a lie it

11118.96 --> 11123.438999999998
just makes you

11120.479 --> 11125.278999999999
having made mistakes right because i did

11123.439 --> 11128.399
ask like proven lies he has not given

11125.279 --> 11131.359
one example he's just blabbering on

11128.399 --> 11132.64
and oh declaring he's protecting kids oh

11131.359 --> 11135.359
so virtuous of you

11132.64 --> 11137.439
so virtuous you're so virtuous but you

11135.359 --> 11139.439
just accuse me of being a liar and you

11137.439 --> 11139.68
haven't actually provided evidence that

11139.439 --> 11143.6
i

11139.68 --> 11146.880000000001
am a liar you see that makes you

11143.6 --> 11148.24
a lying scumbag whatever your intentions

11146.88 --> 11150.479
may be you know

11148.24 --> 11152.16
there's people that think that i do

11150.479 --> 11152.72
everything for the kids do everything

11152.16 --> 11154.96
yeah

11152.72 --> 11156.0
it's like murder people maybe not saying

11154.96 --> 11159.759999999998
that you are but like

11156.0 --> 11160.399
murder people spread vile lies that will

11159.76 --> 11162.319
make

11160.399 --> 11164.08
people that aren't really hurting kids

11162.319 --> 11166.16
maybe even kill themselves because it's

11164.08 --> 11166.88
all for kids because in the end the goal

11166.16 --> 11168.72
is to protect

11166.88 --> 11170.72
kids right so you can do anything

11168.72 --> 11174.319
anything just to protect the kids

11170.72 --> 11176.399
even just horrific things false

11174.319 --> 11178.08
accusations hurting people because

11176.399 --> 11180.479
i don't know there might be a strategy

11178.08 --> 11182.8
conceivable where that could

11180.479 --> 11183.599999999999
lead to helping children and then it's

11182.8 --> 11186.84
justified

11183.6 --> 11188.720000000001

11546.72 --> 11553.84
exactly what that is

11557.12 --> 11566.399000000001
what are you addressing me

11561.2 --> 11568.479000000001
thirst for truth are you addressing me

11566.399 --> 11571.119999999999
because i i don't even have a twitter

11568.479 --> 11571.119999999999
account here

11573.52 --> 11580.479000000001
and i wasn't really a trump [ __ ] either

11576.56 --> 11583.278999999999
kind of dropped off kind of with trump

11580.479 --> 11583.84
you know that in the time when alex

11583.279 --> 11585.76
jones was

11583.84 --> 11587.359
really enthusiastic about trump when he

11585.76 --> 11590.960000000001
had just won

11587.359 --> 11592.960000000001
i basically told him in a chat and i

11590.96 --> 11595.919999999998
knew he was watching i told him

11592.96 --> 11597.519999999999
trump is a really awesome guy until he

11595.92 --> 11600.08
betrays everyone

11597.52 --> 11601.2
and he really did not wanted to hear

11600.08 --> 11602.88
that and i got

11601.2 --> 11605.04
immediately banned from that chat in

11602.88 --> 11606.88
that youtube

11605.04 --> 11609.52
on which like his show was streamed but

11606.88 --> 11612.319
i know that people were looking

11609.52 --> 11614.08
right because i always thought trump was

11612.319 --> 11616.239
kind of funny i just don't think he's

11614.08 --> 11617.84
trustworthy and everything he did well

11616.239 --> 11620.16
i always thought it was just too

11617.84 --> 11622.8
convoluted every time

11620.16 --> 11624.56
it's kind of funny but yeah i was never

11622.8 --> 11626.239
trump tart and i've never been on

11624.56 --> 11627.6
twitter before

11626.239 --> 11629.84
so i don't know where you're getting

11627.6 --> 11629.84
this

11629.92 --> 11639.68
it's weird it's just weird

11637.279 --> 11642.16
god this guy's been spamming my chats

11639.68 --> 11645.279
insane

11642.16 --> 11646.96
what a dick total [ __ ] i can't

11645.279 --> 11647.6
believe i actually let him do this for

11646.96 --> 11650.08
this long

11647.6 --> 11651.6
i was a little intimidated you know why

11650.08 --> 11653.279
because a good servant because good

11651.6 --> 11656.16
servant is basically like a

11653.279 --> 11656.800000000001
freaking mind control lackey apparently

11656.16 --> 11659.6
now do

11656.8 --> 11659.92
everything for him he's like i need to

11659.6 --> 11662.16
be

11659.92 --> 11663.2
here with this guy and protect the

11662.16 --> 11666.239
people that

11663.2 --> 11669.84
are my friends i need to be with this

11666.239 --> 11672.319
guy so i can protect my friends

11669.84 --> 11673.359
it's so important not realizing that

11672.319 --> 11676.8
you're literally

11673.359 --> 11679.359
siding with an enemy hostile scumbag

11676.8 --> 11680.399
that's only out to just try to destroy

11679.359 --> 11682.239
everyone

11680.399 --> 11683.84
he's a destroyer he's very

11682.239 --> 11685.6
indiscriminate the list of people who

11683.84 --> 11687.76
mentioned that don't fit together it

11685.6 --> 11690.960000000001
makes no freaking sense

11687.76 --> 11694.0
so he is a scumbag

11690.96 --> 11697.519999999999
and you have sided with him and you've

11694.0 --> 11698.72
let those notions slip you by a good

11697.52 --> 11702.0
servant

11698.72 --> 11704.399
that makes you an accessory

11702.0 --> 11706.479
right not a criminal this makes you an

11704.399 --> 11707.92
accessory and you apparently don't see

11706.479 --> 11710.96
that you don't see it

11707.92 --> 11712.8
you don't see what you've done right and

11710.96 --> 11716.64
i see it

11712.8 --> 11721.84
and i will address you for it

11716.64 --> 11721.84
because this is absolutely unacceptable

11722.239 --> 11726.0
i thought we were friends and you

11724.0 --> 11728.8
betrayed that friendship

11726.0 --> 11730.72
you betrayed it it's not something i'm

11728.8 --> 11733.679999999998
gonna take lightly

11730.72 --> 11734.96
it's only a few people on the internet

11733.68 --> 11736.800000000001
here that i've had

11734.96 --> 11738.08
what i thought was real friendship that

11736.8 --> 11740.0
betrayed them

11738.08 --> 11743.039999999999
you are now on that list and you

11740.0 --> 11743.04
betrayed yourself

11743.359 --> 11748.16
and i'm done with it and yeah i know you

11746.479 --> 11749.679999999998
want to talk with me over skype after

11748.16 --> 11752.239
this and i will

11749.68 --> 11753.439
but there's nothing that you can say

11752.239 --> 11755.92
right now

11753.439 --> 11757.359
that's going to change this because you

11755.92 --> 11760.88
have betrayed me

11757.359 --> 11760.880000000001
you've betrayed my trust

11761.279 --> 11764.560000000001
and you have sided with a [ __ ] maniac

11764.239 --> 11767.68
i

11764.56 --> 11771.439
warned you about it i literally

11767.68 --> 11773.76
person to person warned you about it

11771.439 --> 11774.720000000001
i didn't even know the guy from what you

11773.76 --> 11778.239

12093.359 --> 12098.720000000001

12818.399 --> 12821.84
like i i don't even understand the

12820.72 --> 12824.08
context of that

12821.84 --> 12825.2
but yeah i do tell people how to behave

12824.08 --> 12828.96
absolutely i do

12825.2 --> 12832.560000000001
you see this is my show

12828.96 --> 12835.919999999998
this is my chat i have rules

12832.56 --> 12838.479
for my chat and i interact with my chat

12835.92 --> 12841.04
on my show and i do it

12838.479 --> 12842.72
under the guise of my show so there is

12841.04 --> 12843.6
going to be times where i'm going to

12842.72 --> 12845.039999999999
tell people

12843.6 --> 12847.12
you're not going to do that anymore if

12845.04 --> 12849.359
you do that and you're banned

12847.12 --> 12851.84
and it's going to be seemingly almost

12849.359 --> 12854.880000000001
unreasonable at times or very tense

12851.84 --> 12855.439
right but i have the [ __ ] right to do

12854.88 --> 12858.479
that

12855.439 --> 12861.439
because it's my damn show

12858.479 --> 12863.599999999999
and if you don't like it then get the

12861.439 --> 12865.84
[ __ ] out

12863.6 --> 12866.720000000001
it's my [ __ ] show it's one show on

12865.84 --> 12870.72
the internet

12866.72 --> 12872.8
one of millions who the [ __ ] are you

host

12887.6 --> 12893.439

12891.2 --> 12895.279
right more reasonable than most because

12893.439 --> 12898.800000000001
most people are too tolerant

12895.279 --> 12899.68
they tolerate [ __ ] and atrocious

12898.8 --> 12902.96
behavior

12899.68 --> 12903.76
and with that pollute everything pollute

12902.96 --> 12906.319

sport of who can say the most disgusting

12913.68 --> 12916.16

that's what happens when you don't keep

12916.16 --> 12921.52
order

12917.279 --> 12923.2
yeah it's my chat i will do it

12956.16 --> 12960.319
ravenous demons

12957.92 --> 12961.76
that literally attack everyone and

12960.319 --> 12964.0
everything

12961.76 --> 12966.16
also projecting outward like they are

12964.0 --> 12969.12
appointed by god to do that you

12966.16 --> 12969.119999999999
[ __ ] freak

13000.0 --> 13004.16

13002.0 --> 13005.68
got basically stalked by some creepy

13004.16 --> 13007.52
[ __ ] that says he's going to

13005.68 --> 13010.08
make slander videos about how i'm

13007.52 --> 13010.960000000001
lying i'm lying i never liked that this

13010.08 --> 13013.84
happened before

13010.96 --> 13016.479
but this time my very what i thought was

13013.84 --> 13018.479
my friend also betrayed me

13016.479 --> 13020.84
he literally betrayed me it hurts it

13018.479 --> 13024.72
hurts right now it hurts here

13020.84 --> 13027.359
hearts so i'm a little

13024.72 --> 13030.319
little oversensitive sorry about that

13027.359 --> 13030.319
yeah how was that

13034.84 --> 13037.84
daddy

13048.84 --> 13051.84
uh

13052.08 --> 13057.039999999999
dude it's crazy it's already over a

13054.72 --> 13058.399
three hour show now

13057.04 --> 13060.399000000001
this is gonna be even longer than

13058.399 --> 13063.358999999999
yesterday

13060.399 --> 13065.84
four more hours well in 20 minutes it's

13063.359 --> 13069.359
gonna be four hours

13065.84 --> 13079.84
so i might just as well continue on

13069.359 --> 13079.84
until that's done

13091.279 --> 13097.68
i can't wake a majority and they are sct

13094.56 --> 13099.6
i don't know what that means crazy if we

13097.68 --> 13106.74
try

13099.6 --> 13108.08
all right

13106.74 --> 13110.319
[Music]

13108.08 --> 13110.319
oh

13118.84 --> 13121.84
man

13121.97 --> 13125.199999999999
[Music]

13136.319 --> 13143.039999999999
so maybe i am gonna run out the show

13140.88 --> 13146.8
anyway it's kind of fallen flat now and

13143.04 --> 13148.160000000002
i see that the chat's gonna died

13146.8 --> 13150.319
i think the people are just getting a

13148.16 --> 13152.399
bit tired of all this i am getting i'm

13150.319 --> 13154.88
literally getting tired like

13152.399 --> 13157.198999999999
this was not fun this was not fun for me

13154.88 --> 13157.198999999999
at all

13157.359 --> 13160.960000000001
kind of the first half i didn't like to

13159.439 --> 13163.199
show much because i was just whining

13160.96 --> 13165.358999999999
about the stupid computer game and that

13163.199 --> 13167.52
yeah that seemed completely useless in

13165.359 --> 13168.960000000001
retrospect although i did get a good tip

13167.52 --> 13170.960000000001
out of it so i might be able to fix the

13168.96 --> 13174.0
situation

13170.96 --> 13175.599999999999
then this like

13174.0 --> 13177.439
you know it's not even that that guy

13175.6 --> 13180.880000000001
just came in chat

13177.439 --> 13185.6
it's that good servant suddenly rolled

13180.88 --> 13189.278999999999
in with him like he's his slave

13185.6 --> 13190.640000000001
like he's his slave i haven't heard from

13189.279 --> 13193.439
good servant

13190.64 --> 13194.96
in my chat for a long time and even in

13193.439 --> 13196.960000000001
freaking skype

13194.96 --> 13199.519999999999
he would not message me and then when he

13196.96 --> 13203.039999999999
would message me he would delete it

13199.52 --> 13206.399000000001
it's just like and now he comes in like

13203.04 --> 13210.319000000001
like a right wing guy

13206.399 --> 13213.198999999999
like a henchman that

13210.319 --> 13214.96
it's beyond atrocious that's the real

13213.199 --> 13218.319000000001
thing that really shocked me it

13214.96 --> 13221.438999999998
really really hurt is the betrayal of

13218.319 --> 13222.96
a friend again again at somebody that i

13221.439 --> 13226.16
confided in

13222.96 --> 13227.519999999999
that i fought for spiritually and he

13226.16 --> 13230.239
betrayed me

13227.52 --> 13232.319000000001
and i'm so disgusted by this like he's

13230.239 --> 13232.56
basically blabbering on and skype to me

13232.319 --> 13235.68
like

13232.56 --> 13236.72
call me this i don't want to know you

13235.68 --> 13239.76
anymore man

13236.72 --> 13243.278999999999
i don't want to know anymore you

13239.76 --> 13246.64
you re you really went too far this time

13243.279 --> 13249.52
i'm so sick of this i don't want to know

13246.64 --> 13249.519999999999
you anymore man

13251.279 --> 13253.76
it's just

13255.12 --> 13262.239000000001
i'm just done with it just done

13259.199 --> 13265.279
how many [ __ ] times do i have to do

13262.239 --> 13268.08
stuff learn somebody trust them

13265.279 --> 13271.12
confide in them and then they [ __ ]

13268.08 --> 13271.12
betray me

13272.84 --> 13275.84
again

13282.16 --> 13285.52
it's like the third time this happened

13283.84 --> 13286.56
since i started the early word show you

13285.52 --> 13289.76
know

13286.56 --> 13294.0
third time first it was jose

13289.76 --> 13296.56
that was ranty and i was good servant

13294.0 --> 13297.76
these were all people i got close with

13296.56 --> 13299.119999999999
that i had personal one-on-one

13297.76 --> 13301.199
conversations with

13299.12 --> 13303.439
that i really was like yeah we we're a

13301.199 --> 13307.04
team right we can do this

13303.439 --> 13317.84
and they all betrayed

13307.04 --> 13317.84
me and it hurts

13319.279 --> 13322.720000000001
especially when they think they can just

13321.04 --> 13324.080000000002
move on from that and everything will be

13322.72 --> 13324.88
all right no it's not going to be all

13324.08 --> 13328.8
right

13324.88 --> 13331.438999999998
you betrayed me and that's personal and

13328.8 --> 13332.08
so that's i can't describe what that

13331.439 --> 13335.68
does

13332.08 --> 13338.64
to somebody what it does to me

13335.68 --> 13340.479000000001
you can't fix that you can't fix

13338.64 --> 13342.72
betrayal

13340.479 --> 13359.84
so problems about betrayal the trail

13342.72 --> 13359.84
cannot really be fixed once it happens

13374.88 --> 13378.479
thank you aramis sandstone have peace

13377.359 --> 13381.04
and hope

13378.479 --> 13383.679999999998
to what you know is true i definitely

13381.04 --> 13383.68
will do that

13384.84 --> 13387.84
definitely

13389.279 --> 13401.84
just putting on some shoes right now

13406.56 --> 13412.56
slept in a box with men for 10 years

13410.64 --> 13413.76
there's impossible death at your hands

13412.56 --> 13416.479
woof

13413.76 --> 13416.479
that's creepy

13422.56 --> 13426.84
let's drove off all else with faith in

13424.88 --> 13428.96
no man

13426.84 --> 13432.56
yeah the last part's

13428.96 --> 13434.56
definitely sensible advice you know

13432.56 --> 13436.08
it's just that at some point you so get

13434.56 --> 13438.319
used to that things are all right that

13436.08 --> 13440.08
you just can't imagine anymore

13438.319 --> 13442.96
that somebody's going to betray you and

13440.08 --> 13446.0
then they do it

13442.96 --> 13447.759999999998
it's like the slow building of trust

13446.0 --> 13449.6
that's something that that cannot be

13447.76 --> 13450.72
helped you just start to trust people

13449.6 --> 13453.199
eventually

13450.72 --> 13454.72
they keep on acting persistently and

13453.199 --> 13457.199
then when they do

13454.72 --> 13459.198999999999
betray you suddenly all like that it's

13457.199 --> 13471.84
such a shock

13459.199 --> 13471.84
it's such a shock guys

13488.319 --> 13493.68
hmm oh excalibur right right i still

13491.92 --> 13495.52
have it yeah yeah

13493.68 --> 13497.359
maybe it's a good time to watch it this

13495.52 --> 13499.84
evening to drag really get my mind of

13497.359 --> 13499.84
things

13500.96 --> 13505.519999999999
that's a good idea try to make a note of

13504.8 --> 13513.84
that

13505.52 --> 13513.84
i remind myself

13521.12 --> 13530.519
all right

13527.45 --> 13530.519
[Music]

13571.199 --> 13575.12
kind of craziness going on around me

13577.279 --> 13583.84
