7.05 --> 38.339999999999996
[Music]

38.69 --> 45.599999999999994
good morning welcome to flatter the

42.629 --> 47.67
earlybird number 203 I'm your host

45.6 --> 49.53
Arwen and before we start the show

47.67 --> 52.769000000000005
please don't forget to share it on any

49.53 --> 54.9
platform you deem fit and if you haven't

52.769 --> 56.64
already subscribed to my channel and hit

54.9 --> 58.26
the bell notification so you know when

56.64 --> 62.28
I'm going live which is normally 2:00

58.26 --> 63.989
p.m. Amsterdam time every day so yeah

62.28 --> 67.32000000000001
today the weather is a little bit

63.989 --> 73.619
different it seems to be a lot more

67.32 --> 76.729
cloudy it's slightly less extremely hot

73.619 --> 79.41
yesterday so I'm actually quite happy

76.729 --> 82.289
about that because yeah when you have a

79.41 --> 86.759
cold and it's extremely hot that's not

82.289 --> 91.41
very nice but it's yeah I like it

86.759 --> 94.71
and hello everyone

91.41 --> 98.82
I got tumeric coffee with me and tea no

94.71 --> 102.02
apple forgot about that but I did get

98.82 --> 104.75899999999999
like this fresh organic tumeric roots

102.02 --> 107.03
really don't know exactly what to do

104.759 --> 109.59
with it yet but maybe I'm like gonna

107.03 --> 112.68
squeeze it up and put that in my coffee

109.59 --> 119.60000000000001
at some point but yeah I thought it was

112.68 --> 119.60000000000001
a nice big one like a finger

121.63 --> 130.25
so sorry about being a little late I had

126.68 --> 135.77
a an overextended phone call with the

130.25 --> 138.26
county about yeah about the bill and it

135.77 --> 141.83
was quite a chore to get through that so

138.26 --> 147.85999999999999
yeah there seem to have been like yeah

141.83 --> 149.93
they say bureaucratically driven sizing

147.86 --> 152.9
up my income too high

149.93 --> 156.32
oh-ho how unexpected they did that so I

152.9 --> 159.70000000000002
will actually get just a consolidation

156.32 --> 163.48999999999998
price back from at least from this month

159.7 --> 166.63
but yeah it's like an I'm still outraged

163.49 --> 174.59
about this and I spoke it out from the

166.63 --> 176.15
total 247 that I got in in March you

174.59 --> 177.8
know how much I have to pay back for

176.15 --> 185.84
that and basically technically already

177.8 --> 189.26000000000002
have 235 so I actually get to keep 12

185.84 --> 193.489
euros from that entire amount and they

189.26 --> 196.13
just straight face it yeah yeah that's

193.489 --> 198.83
just gonna happen that's just how it

196.13 --> 200.989
works and if you want to try to go

198.83 --> 203.209
around it you should have talked with us

200.989 --> 205.489
from the start like we need to be

203.209 --> 207.83
informed about every little freaking

205.489 --> 212.269
detail you do because then we can help

207.83 --> 214.519
you in the special plan so apparently

212.269 --> 219.45000000000002
there's like this different arrangement

214.519 --> 222.07
for part-time part-timers how do you say

219.45 --> 224.81
[Music]

222.07 --> 227.63
I'm losing the word for it but basically

224.81 --> 229.64000000000001
is self-sustaining operators like what

227.63 --> 231.85999999999999
I'm doing and they're apparently then so

229.64 --> 235.72
different type of arrangement bla bla

231.86 --> 240.26000000000002
your bureaucracy I'm sick of this [ __ ] I

235.72 --> 242.69
just prefer to be able to expand and

240.26 --> 248.32899999999998
actually use some of the money that I

242.69 --> 250.23
get to get somewhere to like be able to

248.329 --> 253.62
do more and

250.23 --> 257.549
potentially get more money but yeah they

253.62 --> 260.34000000000003
seem to disagree on that really

257.549 --> 264.47999999999996
practically although they had the woman

260.34 --> 269.92999999999995
that I talked to mostly did she did feel

264.48 --> 272.639
me so entrepreneur yeah I guess

269.93 --> 277.19
although entrepreneurs really like we

272.639 --> 278.49
are trying something new I'm just a

277.19 --> 281.43
self-employed

278.49 --> 284.09000000000003
I think this that's probably how we

281.43 --> 284.09000000000003
should call it

290.74 --> 296.87
anyway yeah that happened and it

294.259 --> 298.759
expanded she said like yeah well my

296.87 --> 301.49
Turkish little time then basically

298.759 --> 303.86
called a blade and then I ended up like

301.49 --> 306.289
up until two o'clock pretty much and I

303.86 --> 308.24
didn't get a chance to turn on the

306.289 --> 317.09
coffee so I was pretty much waiting for

308.24 --> 319.1
coffee before this no yeah now I need to

317.09 --> 326.86999999999995
let this all sink in at least I'm gonna

319.1 --> 328.37
get something back that's gonna help and

326.87 --> 332.65
I don't know I don't know what this

328.37 --> 335.15
newer supposed arrangement for part-time

332.65 --> 338.17999999999995
entrepreneurs or whatever it's going to

335.15 --> 340.00899999999996
be like maybe it'll it will help I'm

338.18 --> 343.49
just wondering like why isn't all that

340.009 --> 345.68
[ __ ] just automated it's literally just

343.49 --> 348.289
trying to force people to constantly

345.68 --> 351.77
interact with them so they can literally

348.289 --> 353.479
keep track that's what it comes down to

351.77 --> 355.76
really that's just how it feels

353.479 --> 361.94
everybody's used to it and I just can't

355.76 --> 364.24
get used to that yeah so how is everyone

361.94 --> 364.24
doing

369.34 --> 372.529
[Music]

372.759 --> 375.659
now cut

379.32 --> 381.34999999999997
ah

386.39 --> 396.51
this is funny righteous force well you

390.57 --> 398.7
know what before like the moments I

396.51 --> 400.59
didn't realize about flat earth and that

398.7 --> 402.47999999999996
the globe really was a lie although I

400.59 --> 405.27
did get hints but when I didn't let the

402.48 --> 407.16
sinking yeah I wanted to be like one of

405.27 --> 409.56
these guys that like Neil deGrasse Tyson

407.16 --> 412.05
or something that talked about space and

409.56 --> 414.14
I kind of did that on my own at times I

412.05 --> 419.43
loved that storytelling medium as well

414.14 --> 423.0
back in it at the end the day but yeah

419.43 --> 425.16
once I really woke up that just doesn't

423.0 --> 428.73
work anymore and I would never be able

425.16 --> 432.27000000000004
to do that if I didn't really believe in

428.73 --> 438.72
it that was just that would eat away at

432.27 --> 440.06
me you know so no not really thought of

438.72 --> 445.14000000000004
doing that

440.06 --> 455.97
that'd be a very uncomfortable way of

445.14 --> 458.28
going around yeah so anyway let's see so

455.97 --> 467.03000000000003
first we got Steve a righteous force

458.28 --> 467.03
over muku I mean UK Jason James Mason

468.93 --> 479.88
[ __ ] fairy alley be lopat no more ace

477.34 --> 479.88
MacLeod

487.11 --> 489.77000000000004
but

490.25 --> 493.85
Sam Bovie

501.599 --> 512.729
all right I have peanuts Clark and

505.679 --> 520.56
Orinoco bumble super curved I see so

512.729 --> 523.3190000000001
yeah welcome to be fair I'd really just

520.56 --> 529.68
prefer like after that freaking phone

523.319 --> 531.81
call and having some it's like basically

529.68 --> 533.6389999999999
yeah that thing that I shared like okay

531.81 --> 537.4799999999999
they're gonna take like literally more

533.639 --> 539.759
than 90% of it so yeah my original

537.48 --> 543.3290000000001
outrage that's been totally justified

539.759 --> 546.029
that's actually the case but at the same

543.329 --> 549.449
time okay I may be getting like 70 euros

546.029 --> 552.3
or something more even 75 euros back

549.449 --> 557.43
like on the short run and that's like oh

552.3 --> 562.2299999999999
my god I got some breathing room so yeah

557.43 --> 563.4899999999999
it's it's a drop in the bucket but at

562.23 --> 566.13
least it's something

563.49 --> 568.019
it's a consolidation price basically and

566.13 --> 570.029
I'm kind of relieved about that because

568.019 --> 576.509
I literally thought that no no they're

570.029 --> 578.899
just not gonna take it all and this is a

576.509 --> 581.49
little better I mean just little relief

578.899 --> 587.16
and I kind of feel like taking a smoke

581.49 --> 589.589
mmm but I'm doing the show and I wasn't

587.16 --> 591.949
gonna let you all wait another 50

589.589 --> 591.9490000000001
minutes

595.41 --> 605.6089999999999
yeah so yeah what if I had been doing

598.859 --> 607.6990000000001
yesterday watching some weird nerd

605.609 --> 611.519
videos like the angry video game nerd

607.699 --> 613.8589999999999
like I it's funny I've known about him

611.519 --> 617.369
for a long time but I've always followed

613.859 --> 619.919
like his proposed opponent the Nostalgia

617.369 --> 623.429
Critic they're following him pretty

619.919 --> 625.379
tightly but I knew he was around I even

623.429 --> 627.689
know other people that were fans of the

625.379 --> 629.97
angry video game nerd but I always

627.689 --> 632.4889999999999
thought like his potty-mouth nature was

629.97 --> 635.519
kind of off-putting but I don't know in

632.489 --> 637.7090000000001
this and how things have changed no I

635.519 --> 640.679
think I've changed become more used to

637.709 --> 642.569
sometimes swearing now I started

640.679 --> 644.3389999999999
watching it for the first time basically

642.569 --> 647.2489999999999
like really watching it and there's like

644.339 --> 650.369
its entire seasons put in one video two

647.249 --> 653.369
hours of that [ __ ] and it's freakin

650.369 --> 657.119
hilarious that guy is such a huge

653.369 --> 659.729
talented comedian it's it's much better

657.119 --> 662.839
than I expected so I'm kind of having

659.729 --> 667.619
fun with that [ __ ] it's like really

662.839 --> 669.9490000000001
nostalgic nerds overkill you were and I

667.619 --> 674.369
can very much appreciate that

669.949 --> 677.189
considering where I'm coming from hello

674.369 --> 680.5790000000001
Jessica oh yeah we have another great

677.189 --> 683.4889999999999
conversation I sometimes have created

680.579 --> 685.8499999999999
conversation with Jessica just keep on

683.489 --> 685.85
going

687.19 --> 690.0
love it

692.5 --> 703.39
a low Riley oh you yeah sorry I can't

700.27 --> 706.63
hear if people call me on skype because

703.39 --> 709.27
I got it on on mute so that I don't

706.63 --> 711.04
constantly hear that [ __ ] because trolls

709.27 --> 713.68
will start to call in just to make that

711.04 --> 721.6899999999999
noise but oh yeah I'll call you I'll get

713.68 --> 729.3399999999999
you on the show YouTube yesterday by the

721.69 --> 731.32
way a low yes Wow what I went to watch

729.34 --> 735.01
the homecoming from liver pills oh oh

731.32 --> 737.95
god you're you're in like a and football

735.01 --> 740.14
mania yeah I'm in a cult it's called

737.95 --> 744.25
football yeah look what do you know what

740.14 --> 745.75
is it let's to translate ly to translate

744.25 --> 748.36
to the public he's like going through

745.75 --> 750.54
the Obama just won the presidency for

748.36 --> 756.34
the first time face but with football

750.54 --> 758.56
right one the highest prestigious most

756.34 --> 760.48
the most highest prestigious accolade in

758.56 --> 762.3699999999999
club football and it only happened it's

760.48 --> 763.9300000000001
like it only happens every now and again

762.37 --> 765.16
it doesn't happen very often but you

763.93 --> 767.65
know what a notice Tywin that was the

765.16 --> 769.12
most prevalent thing of the day a notice

767.65 --> 770.62
that when you're at sea level I mean

769.12 --> 772.33
sorry when you're at crowd level because

770.62 --> 774.52
if the crowd was condensed that much

772.33 --> 775.99
when all the heads were all the same

774.52 --> 777.8199999999999
height as me that's kind of like getting

775.99 --> 779.41
low to the ground and getting like

777.82 --> 781.5100000000001
trying to look overweight oh you're some

779.41 --> 784.54
hits are you sure you saw the curvature

781.51 --> 786.88
didn't you know what I realize is I had

784.54 --> 789.3399999999999
to get highest what is London yeah

786.88 --> 791.47
exactly because you get the consume and

789.34 --> 798.61
effect because of the curvature of the

791.47 --> 800.35
public yes I don't know 300 feet or so I

798.61 --> 802.09
had to get a bulletin and that's you

800.35 --> 802.8100000000001
know if it ballers would if that was

802.09 --> 804.07
done over water

802.81 --> 806.1099999999999
Boulder's would say that's because of

804.07 --> 807.4300000000001
the curve but clearly it was because of

806.11 --> 809.02
the obstruction of different height

807.43 --> 810.31
peoples with different sized heads and

809.02 --> 812.23
different haircuts and all that I

810.31 --> 814.4499999999999
couldn't see far enough so I had to get

812.23 --> 816.6700000000001
higher and I just think it's our ironic

814.45 --> 819.6400000000001
that I managed to get a flyer thanga lon

816.67 --> 822.61
this cuz it was just fat yeah a flat

819.64 --> 823.68
crowd yeah perspective is a bit G food a

822.61 --> 826.529
baller

823.68 --> 830.9699999999999
it is they really have a lot of trouble

826.529 --> 832.11
reconciling with that yeah there is

830.97 --> 834.3000000000001
concealment

832.11 --> 838.29
when looking over flat surfaces I'm

834.3 --> 840.81
sorry it is there and I am basically now

838.29 --> 842.88
starting to repeat myself every day you

840.81 --> 845.27
can say it in such a basic sentence and

842.88 --> 849.56
it literally strangles them every time

845.27 --> 852.21
because they have to have to keep that

849.56 --> 854.16
possibility that the concealment is

852.21 --> 856.9200000000001
there because of curvature but you could

854.16 --> 858.8389999999999
just say nope it's always there it's

856.92 --> 863.4599999999999
part of sight it's there on the flat

858.839 --> 865.74
surface so good luck with that yeah yeah

863.46 --> 868.83
there's no way getting around that it's

865.74 --> 872.37
there yeah it doesn't matter if it's

868.83 --> 874.14
curved or flat it's there it was just

872.37 --> 875.91
like looking at the low-level horizons

874.14 --> 878.04
and I know that ballers ignore

875.91 --> 880.9499999999999
perspective she can chat and chat right

878.04 --> 883.65
now they can't handle it they can't

880.95 --> 886.11
handle it can't handle the truth

883.65 --> 889.05
there's concealment we're looking past

886.11 --> 894.48
the flat surface it's there yeah it's

889.05 --> 896.37
part of site so uh Eric healed the hoop

894.48 --> 897.9
Araki older hoop says did you guys

896.37 --> 899.94
already discuss what bob knodell said

897.9 --> 901.65
about gravity and force which bit he

899.94 --> 904.08
said quite a few things the chances I

901.65 --> 905.9399999999999
would probably have and but you know

904.08 --> 907.7090000000001
what I want to do I want to point out

905.94 --> 910.19
toward that the fly earth side that the

907.709 --> 914.4
rumpus claims that scales

910.19 --> 916.47
are a force measuring device so in the

914.4 --> 918.6899999999999
context of Cavendish we noticed that the

916.47 --> 920.58
Cavendish balls appear to move and the

918.69 --> 922.7090000000001
issue is is it mass attractive mass that

920.58 --> 924.51
causes it or not so I went through a

922.709 --> 926.64
thought experiment right to demonstrate

924.51 --> 928.14
what Cavendish is doing in the context

926.64 --> 930.27
of scales because one pose always brings

928.14 --> 932.85
it up so if I saw if I stand on a set of

930.27 --> 935.459
scales and I waste 16 stone the scales

932.85 --> 937.02
are going to show 16 stone right in the

935.459 --> 939.39
Cavendish experiment the balls appear to

937.02 --> 940.11
move that's the effect when I stand on

939.39 --> 942.72
the scales

940.11 --> 943.95
the effect is 16 stone but because the

942.72 --> 945.8100000000001
Cavendish experiment doesn't have a

943.95 --> 948.45
force because mu 2 says that gravity is

945.81 --> 950.5799999999999
not a force it's recording movement in

948.45 --> 952.74
the same way that the scales record 16

950.58 --> 954.2090000000001
stone when I don't stand on them so what

952.74 --> 955.47
rompers is effectively arguing or

954.209 --> 957.0889999999999
anybody that thinks gravity is a force

955.47 --> 959.1
while they're effectively

957.089 --> 961.74
arguing is that you can stand next to a

959.1 --> 963.36
set of scales and record a weight being

961.74 --> 965.1
put on the scales without anything being

963.36 --> 969.2090000000001
put on the scales that's what they're

965.1 --> 973.589
actually arguing it's nonsense you get

969.209 --> 975.6289999999999
yeah well they basically take yeah they

973.589 --> 978.749
assume a force but they're basically

975.629 --> 980.16
using the fictitious force or the

978.749 --> 982.6800000000001
assumption of the force in the

980.16 --> 985.259
calculations and as stated it'll work

982.68 --> 990.12
out and I've said it literally doesn't

985.259 --> 992.639
mean that's a real thing no yeah

990.12 --> 994.41
righteous force says Signori you don't

992.639 --> 996.3
agree with Bob knodell on that science

994.41 --> 998.279
debacle but I've always leaned on his

996.3 --> 1000.29
side for gravity he's not arguing for

998.279 --> 1001.279
gravity the problem is you Bob thinks

1000.29 --> 1003.259
that there's something additional

1001.279 --> 1005.3
something extra that's called in an

1003.259 --> 1007.61
acceleration right which may or may may

1005.3 --> 1009.9799999999999
or may not well be true and I don't

1007.61 --> 1011.839
disagree with him on that point and but

1009.98 --> 1012.6800000000001
because he calls it gravity and an

1011.839 --> 1014.8090000000001
acceleration

1012.68 --> 1016.3389999999999
it makes bowlers think that there is an

1014.809 --> 1018.86
acceleration due to gravity and it's a

1016.339 --> 1020.5690000000001
really misleading term because it's a

1018.86 --> 1022.97
key it's a loaded term isn't it gravity

1020.569 --> 1025.579
he's describing something that's not

1022.97 --> 1027.679
what we're told as this gravity below

1025.579 --> 1029.149
can see it become so we need to call it

1027.679 --> 1030.74
somewhere else because it makes people

1029.149 --> 1032.75
think that it's confused it makes people

1030.74 --> 1034.22
confused so what we've suggested is we

1032.75 --> 1036.35
should call it Dada T because basically

1034.22 --> 1037.73
the can't prove it's not God know if

1036.35 --> 1039.1989999999998
they're gonna claim it's gravity we can

1037.73 --> 1040.819
equally claim that it's some other force

1039.199 --> 1042.26
and what I'm living to the force out

1040.819 --> 1044.3899999999999
there is that everybody generally

1042.26 --> 1046.459
accepts is Omni omnipotence everywhere

1044.39 --> 1048.98
applying all right now don't do that

1046.459 --> 1051.1100000000001
just you know if you wanna if you want

1048.98 --> 1054.6490000000001
to know just call it unicorn farts okay

1051.11 --> 1056.7199999999998
just don't start using the Lord's name

1054.649 --> 1059.809
in vain for some freaking joke yeah I'm

1056.72 --> 1062.0
okay with that call it unicorn farts but

1059.809 --> 1063.62
the point is that we don't Bob and I

1062.0 --> 1066.169
don't actually disagree that the maybe

1063.62 --> 1067.789
somet additional but but with regards to

1066.169 --> 1069.26
that additional thing Bob thinks that it

1067.789 --> 1071.84
is a force he thinks that it causes

1069.26 --> 1073.64
acceleration right that may well be true

1071.84 --> 1075.649
but there is no evidence that it's true

1073.64 --> 1077.029
because what bob says that supports it

1075.649 --> 1080.1789999999999
is the gravimeter he says that that

1077.029 --> 1081.5
measures a force well that you have to

1080.179 --> 1082.789
demonstrate that that measurement is

1081.5 --> 1084.83
actually a force and it's not a

1082.789 --> 1086.36
measurement of something else because if

1084.83 --> 1089.21
it is a force it needs to be able to

1086.36 --> 1090.1689999999999
cause something so to claim that there's

1089.21 --> 1092.8690000000001
a number there on

1090.169 --> 1094.8500000000001
on a device is the measurement but to

1092.869 --> 1096.7099999999998
prove that it causes submit there's got

1094.85 --> 1098.899
to be an application of that measurement

1096.71 --> 1102.98
or an application of science to prove

1098.899 --> 1105.83
that it will do something well it works

1102.98 --> 1108.019
perfectly if you just presuppose it yeah

1105.83 --> 1110.84
but it could also be equally be

1108.019 --> 1113.109
measuring pressured variations or sound

1110.84 --> 1115.82
variations and giving you a number

1113.109 --> 1118.1
variations are can absolutely be

1115.82 --> 1119.989
attributed together

1118.1 --> 1122.059
thank you that's the freaking thing

1119.989 --> 1125.239
about it the whole structure kind of

1122.059 --> 1127.22
pans out theoretically it does where

1125.239 --> 1130.039
that's the that's the aberration about

1127.22 --> 1132.289
it it's so suggestible so suggestive

1130.039 --> 1134.179
that it's that there's really something

1132.289 --> 1137.6589999999999
there but when you try to get to the

1134.179 --> 1140.5700000000002
tangible part of it then it's nope you

1137.659 --> 1142.429
can't find it there so Billy was it says

1140.57 --> 1144.23
hi sexy I'm not sure if he's talking to

1142.429 --> 1148.759
you I we know me but hi Billy I'll take

1144.23 --> 1150.23
it as though it was aimed at me okay so

1148.759 --> 1152.21
that Ronnie for she says why would

1150.23 --> 1154.85
terminal velocity happen if it was a

1152.21 --> 1158.269
force the same question you can ask is

1154.85 --> 1160.4889999999998
why is absolute zero minus 230 why ever

1158.269 --> 1162.32
is why that number why not a different

1160.489 --> 1164.809
number and it seems to be evidence of

1162.32 --> 1166.85
designed for me and that terminal

1164.809 --> 1168.619
velocity is that the maximum speed that

1166.85 --> 1170.389
an object would fall because it really

1168.619 --> 1172.58
shouldn't be a maximum Bob mentioned the

1170.389 --> 1174.1999999999998
song that globe Busters show in theory

1172.58 --> 1176.059
it would continue accelerating an

1174.2 --> 1177.32
increase in velocity until it well I

1176.059 --> 1178.399
don't know what would there be a point I

1177.32 --> 1180.019
don't know maybe the what maybe there

1178.399 --> 1182.119
wouldn't but if there is a point then

1180.019 --> 1185.2
that must be a limitation of nature

1182.119 --> 1187.789
because and that would indicate design

1185.2 --> 1189.529
the fact that there is a terminal

1187.789 --> 1191.179
velocity in a vacuum is interesting

1189.529 --> 1193.129
because it does open there it becomes

1191.179 --> 1195.44
philosophical we don't know what to how

1193.129 --> 1198.4399999999998
to interpret a terminal velocity you

1195.44 --> 1203.1190000000001
mean a maximum falling speed right yeah

1198.44 --> 1204.47
yeah that's not true why do you think

1203.119 --> 1206.2099999999998
that you would get that comment over me

1204.47 --> 1207.739
because he's clearly talking to me over

1206.21 --> 1210.8890000000001
our Whitney's easy dressing the panel

1207.739 --> 1213.44
isn't anyway well hold on you're buying

1210.889 --> 1214.879
up something weird and I in my show I

1213.44 --> 1216.8890000000001
don't think that they're in a vacuum

1214.879 --> 1219.769
there is a terminal velocity I think

1216.889 --> 1221.5089999999998
terminal velocity is purely based on the

1219.769 --> 1222.29
resistance of the medium that will

1221.509 --> 1224.5
actually

1222.29 --> 1227.0
that terminal velocity that's demonstra

1224.5 --> 1230.0
the water thinks dropping through that

1227.0 --> 1232.67
in air rising all that that's always the

1230.0 --> 1236.03
air friction of the medium that will set

1232.67 --> 1237.98
a terminal velocity or ascend rate yeah

1236.03 --> 1240.08
but like if you remove the friction from

1237.98 --> 1242.69
the media minute then the acceleration

1240.08 --> 1245.8999999999999
can potentially continue on until the

1242.69 --> 1248.45
space maneuvering space runs out so yeah

1245.9 --> 1252.38
you want to create a tube a vacuum of

1248.45 --> 1254.9
like a mile deep to demonstrate that

1252.38 --> 1258.14
this is I don't think there is a

1254.9 --> 1259.52
terminal velocity in vacuum but we're

1258.14 --> 1265.25
into the world of theoretical physics

1259.52 --> 1268.4
army well no no well yeah potentially

1265.25 --> 1272.39
you'd have to demonstrate it to confirm

1268.4 --> 1275.63
it but I've never seen it's always been

1272.39 --> 1277.76
like I said as I see things as I observe

1275.63 --> 1281.17
them things have a terminal velocity

1277.76 --> 1284.66
because of their medium I even

1281.17 --> 1287.69
experience falling like when jumping and

1284.66 --> 1290.48
yeah the terminal velocity is when the

1287.69 --> 1293.8400000000001
pressure of the air through which you

1290.48 --> 1296.72
pass starts to form a cushion a stable

1293.84 --> 1298.73
cushion and then you have a terminal

1296.72 --> 1301.25
velocity then you don't accelerate any

1298.73 --> 1304.06
further you just drop and you get the

1301.25 --> 1307.22
moment of special yeah a sensation I

1304.06 --> 1310.37
dropped from rocks in the into the ocean

1307.22 --> 1314.14
was very interesting to do that but even

1310.37 --> 1317.8999999999999
as yeah as you see a brick sink in water

1314.14 --> 1322.8200000000002
it will quickly get to the terminal

1317.9 --> 1325.94
velocity points hmm because water is

1322.82 --> 1328.01
such a thick medium to go through and in

1325.94 --> 1329.93
air the acceleration will continue on

1328.01 --> 1332.51
but then eventually the cushion effect

1329.93 --> 1333.95
starts to form and then a terminal

1332.51 --> 1337.1
velocity is reached because of the

1333.95 --> 1339.53
medium super curved thinks I don't know

1337.1 --> 1341.48
the laws of motion yeah I used the laws

1339.53 --> 1344.6299999999999
of motion to demonstrate that gravity

1341.48 --> 1347.3600000000001
was not in the egg experiment yeah they

1344.63 --> 1348.89
don't need a force to prove to me to

1347.36 --> 1350.3799999999999
make an accelerating mass you just

1348.89 --> 1352.7
needed to see a density disequilibrium

1350.38 --> 1354.47
you have two objects relative to each

1352.7 --> 1355.51
other very close proximity or touching

1354.47 --> 1357.49
to each other

1355.51 --> 1359.14
gives you a vector and then change the

1357.49 --> 1361.57
density of something and then you will

1359.14 --> 1364.1200000000001
get a movement no force required and a

1361.57 --> 1366.7
force then where is it prove it because

1364.12 --> 1368.3799999999999
I caused it not gravity in scientific

1366.7 --> 1371.2
experiment gravity would be an

1368.38 --> 1373.42
additional inferred course caused in the

1371.2 --> 1374.98
reality world a scientific method states

1373.42 --> 1377.23
that the independent variable the thing

1374.98 --> 1378.82
that I manipulate is the cause so unless

1377.23 --> 1380.8
you're gonna yeah I'm rewriting their

1378.82 --> 1383.11
vehicles MA yeah because I made it move

1380.8 --> 1384.22
that's the point so scientific method

1383.11 --> 1386.05
states that the independent variable

1384.22 --> 1388.15
must be manipulated by the observer

1386.05 --> 1390.34
it's the presumed cause I was that

1388.15 --> 1393.19
observer i manipulated the density

1390.34 --> 1394.54
change so in by virtue of that that

1393.19 --> 1396.13
means that gravity couldn't have done it

1394.54 --> 1398.05
but if you think that there's gravity

1396.13 --> 1399.5800000000002
cause in it do the same experiment and

1398.05 --> 1400.1499999999999
manipulate that gravity and then let's

1399.58 --> 1401.77
see it move

1400.15 --> 1403.18
it's never gonna often is it you know

1401.77 --> 1405.1
what I know it you've got no evidence to

1403.18 --> 1406.96
support this gravity and even if you did

1405.1 --> 1408.52
it's not a force but you can treat it as

1406.96 --> 1411.3700000000001
a force is completely lots of codswallop

1408.52 --> 1415.15
it's not even treated as a force it's

1411.37 --> 1418.36
more rather treated as a unified force

1415.15 --> 1421.48
this equilibrium constant that's truly

1418.36 --> 1424.06
how its yeah how you can interpret it

1421.48 --> 1426.67
and apply it in calculations because a

1424.06 --> 1428.6499999999999
force is literally like motions and it's

1426.67 --> 1431.68
clear signs and all the elements from it

1428.65 --> 1434.89
gravity doesn't really do that they just

1431.68 --> 1439.51
speculated because they assume there is

1434.89 --> 1442.2700000000002
a place where you can elude this effect

1439.51 --> 1444.76
that is assumed to be gravity here in

1442.27 --> 1446.41
our world I think is super curved

1444.76 --> 1447.61
doesn't understand F equals MA either

1446.41 --> 1449.65
cuz thought what he's doing he says

1447.61 --> 1451.9599999999998
you're ignoring the buoyant force what

1449.65 --> 1454.63
William force we I changed the medium

1451.96 --> 1455.98
they AG displaced yeah that may well

1454.63 --> 1458.1100000000001
have been a changing the pressure but

1455.98 --> 1459.6100000000001
argue that well that change in pressure

1458.11 --> 1461.77
is gonna be the cause that were

1459.61 --> 1463.7199999999998
observing cuz I caused it but you're

1461.77 --> 1465.79
calling it a buoyant force well that's

1463.72 --> 1467.1100000000001
when you add mass to it and by virtue of

1465.79 --> 1469.42
the mass that you are do you then claim

1467.11 --> 1471.4599999999998
gravity but in real world in experiment

1469.42 --> 1473.0800000000002
there is no evidence of gravity the only

1471.46 --> 1475.8400000000001
evidence exists is by changing the

1473.08 --> 1478.1499999999999
density we cause displacements we did it

1475.84 --> 1483.4499999999998
so that makes it the cause changing the

1478.15 --> 1486.22
density sorry yep density or the weight

1483.45 --> 1488.73
everything relating to any kind of

1486.22 --> 1491.67
attempt to prove or establish gravity

1488.73 --> 1494.99
is always manipulating either mass or

1491.67 --> 1497.76
weight or something in that direction

1494.99 --> 1500.28
it's always and that's really where they

1497.76 --> 1503.04
where it's all tied in and gravity

1500.28 --> 1506.61
really is just a framework overarching

1503.04 --> 1509.8799999999999
theory about it all to fit it to fit

1506.61 --> 1516.03
several elements together in it and very

1509.88 --> 1521.64
easy to conclude setup but it's purely a

1516.03 --> 1524.76
framework there's no foundation it's

1521.64 --> 1528.1200000000001
just a theory about how mass is

1524.76 --> 1531.0
interacted try to figure out what's

1528.12 --> 1534.6599999999999
going on in a more overarching structure

1531.0 --> 1535.77
and it's just wrong it's not

1534.66 --> 1538.02
straightforward

1535.77 --> 1540.0
Caryn's given me a great video she says

1538.02 --> 1542.19
explain this with density Netherlands

1540.0 --> 1545.64
British and Dutch scientists make a frog

1542.19 --> 1547.02
floats in midair I'm watching it I'm not

1545.64 --> 1550.88
gonna play it and we're gonna what and

1547.02 --> 1553.2
I'm gonna doesn't have sound as it I

1550.88 --> 1555.99
don't think our sound which is fine dad

1553.2 --> 1557.16
don't play sound on my show please no no

1555.99 --> 1559.11
I don't think it's gonna sound I'm just

1557.16 --> 1560.8500000000001
looking at it so basically it looks like

1559.11 --> 1565.9199999999998
he's got a beaker with some water in it

1560.85 --> 1567.24
and little baby frogs okay but I don't

1565.92 --> 1571.3500000000001
know what he's doing to make the ate the

1567.24 --> 1573.18
Frog do that is he a giant magnetic

1571.35 --> 1575.73
field have a froggy rightly so used

1573.18 --> 1578.3400000000001
magnetic field have made a frog float in

1575.73 --> 1579.57
midair and might even be able to do the

1578.34 --> 1583.9399999999998
same thing with a human being

1579.57 --> 1590.4299999999998
so they using a giant magnetic field

1583.94 --> 1592.56
explained this relative density so it's

1590.43 --> 1594.3
clearly an electromagnetic effect isn't

1592.56 --> 1596.07
it the densities are the stable

1594.3 --> 1597.48
constants and the change in the

1596.07 --> 1599.6699999999998
electromagnetic effect magnetic

1597.48 --> 1601.68
levitation sure it's this lace meant

1599.67 --> 1603.6000000000001
there's our there's magnetic driven

1601.68 --> 1606.9
displacement provable variable

1603.6 --> 1609.36
displacement going on to add to the set

1606.9 --> 1611.49
up the karen says explain this with

1609.36 --> 1613.2299999999998
density right so the density of the frog

1611.49 --> 1615.06
is a constant the density the medium

1613.23 --> 1617.57
it's in is a constant electromagnetic

1615.06 --> 1620.55
effect caused by a giant magnet or waba

1617.57 --> 1622.08
that's been the cause so the the

1620.55 --> 1622.4099999999999
explanation with density is that the

1622.08 --> 1625.77
dense

1622.41 --> 1627.39
these were constants what the electoral

1625.77 --> 1630.57
magnetic levitation was caused by the

1627.39 --> 1632.19
Big D giant magnet listen I'm not

1630.57 --> 1634.6799999999998
against the idea of electromagnetic

1632.19 --> 1635.79
effect I've always been like pro lap or

1634.68 --> 1637.6200000000001
calling it gravity

1635.79 --> 1641.79
the minute we call it gravity ball is

1637.62 --> 1642.8999999999999
steel what we say and then ignore the

1641.79 --> 1643.8
fact that they've changed the context

1642.9 --> 1646.0800000000002
and then accusers have been

1643.8 --> 1646.9199999999998
cherry-picking or dishonest in some way

1646.08 --> 1649.8899999999999
in its nonsense

1646.92 --> 1651.9
why does it work well if you change the

1649.89 --> 1654.5400000000002
electromagnetic effect and it causes the

1651.9 --> 1656.16
the Frog to change its position the Frog

1654.54 --> 1661.1399999999999
must have a conductivity to it mustn't

1656.16 --> 1664.65
it yes but look still it can never be

1661.14 --> 1667.65
gravity because it has measurable side

1664.65 --> 1670.3200000000002
effects and it has like reach specific

1667.65 --> 1672.72
points where forces are applied because

1670.32 --> 1675.06
of the effect and only because in

1672.72 --> 1677.73
certain cases like not everything is

1675.06 --> 1682.86
viable to magnetics so it's not gravity

1677.73 --> 1684.15
it's not even close Karen B says where

1682.86 --> 1685.5
did she say that man I'm not saying

1684.15 --> 1687.18
there is gravity but it's more than

1685.5 --> 1688.86
density yeah I I do agree with that I

1687.18 --> 1690.93
think there may well be more than it and

1688.86 --> 1693.3
the scientific method could prove that

1690.93 --> 1695.19
with the with the M the egg and I'm not

1693.3 --> 1697.86
saying it's not let me actually agree on

1695.19 --> 1699.63
this that bits not in disagreement the

1697.86 --> 1701.76
bit that is in disagreement is that a it

1699.63 --> 1703.5900000000001
can be a force and if it is a force to

1701.76 --> 1704.67
what extent I mean people think that if

1703.59 --> 1706.47
you jump out of a plane without a

1704.67 --> 1709.02
parachute that's gravity it's clearly

1706.47 --> 1710.94
not it's clearly a tiny tiny tiny force

1709.02 --> 1712.68
if it is a force and we need to prove

1710.94 --> 1714.93
that it causes an effect now if the Frog

1712.68 --> 1716.97
is proving a cause and effect then that

1714.93 --> 1720.0600000000002
opens the idea up to electromagnetic

1716.97 --> 1721.47
effect I agree however ballers think

1720.06 --> 1724.53
that people falling out of planes is

1721.47 --> 1726.1200000000001
gravity it's clearly not so ballers need

1724.53 --> 1728.52
they don't understand the scale here

1726.12 --> 1730.11
it's it's it's at the micro level right

1728.52 --> 1732.93
that's what we all need to understand

1730.11 --> 1734.9399999999998
somebody else of them sting not stingray

1732.93 --> 1736.8600000000001
super Cove says explain a zero-g Force

1734.94 --> 1740.5800000000002
flight with density all right well we're

1736.86 --> 1742.2299999999998
in zero-g now we are in that zero-g what

1740.58 --> 1744.3899999999999
you're doing with what you call a zero-g

1742.23 --> 1745.47
force flight is you're falling out the

1744.39 --> 1747.2700000000002
sky here at a rate of acceleration

1745.47 --> 1749.43
that's equal to the person falling out

1747.27 --> 1750.75
the sky at that same rate how in any way

1749.43 --> 1752.52
is that a zero-g

1750.75 --> 1754.14
you think it's j0g because they've put

1752.52 --> 1755.879
that name to it but what you do in is

1754.14 --> 1757.469
you in a state of free fall

1755.879 --> 1759.7489999999998
it has absolutely no application

1757.469 --> 1761.819
whatsoever stingray says and amends

1759.749 --> 1763.019
accelerometer I don't know what I have

1761.819 --> 1767.519
to look into it I don't know what that

1763.019 --> 1768.8990000000001
even is to be honest Joshua I heard your

1767.519 --> 1771.359
lines channel Q about your mart tale

1768.899 --> 1774.2689999999998
about why do you keep lying right

1771.359 --> 1775.889
evidence for what the lie is if you want

1774.269 --> 1778.139
to look on my channel Joshua with the

1775.889 --> 1780.2089999999998
ten-foot wall at 30 miles thinking its

1778.139 --> 1781.9489999999998
ten-four could you redic there's a video

1780.209 --> 1782.3990000000001
entitled background go and watch that

1781.949 --> 1788.699
video

1782.399 --> 1795.779
it explains it fully ok hope someone's

1788.699 --> 1799.919
at the door one sec alright yeah man

1795.779 --> 1806.449
well Riley hijacked the show but that's

1799.919 --> 1806.449
ok it's good to talk about physics again

1808.399 --> 1814.049
I'm gonna stick to just gravity being a

1811.559 --> 1816.029
virtual force or a parent force not

1814.049 --> 1818.099
really a force but you can think of it

1816.029 --> 1819.869
as a force and that sounds so ridiculous

1818.099 --> 1828.359
and doublethink but in this case it

1819.869 --> 1830.779
might actually be kind of true and I sit

1828.359 --> 1833.1589999999999
down like yeah there is the weird

1830.779 --> 1835.44
acceleration factor as part of the

1833.159 --> 1838.1390000000001
natural setup natural observations

1835.44 --> 1842.19
that's there but to attribute that to a

1838.139 --> 1844.619
force because when ya acceleration and

1842.19 --> 1848.009
accelerating objects when applied a

1844.619 --> 1851.4289999999999
certain type of thrust or whatever shows

1848.009 --> 1854.249
the same symptom of acceleration - then

1851.429 --> 1856.289
attribute automatically a force to

1854.249 --> 1859.199
things falling through a vacuum the

1856.289 --> 1863.099
standard acceleration rate yeah that's

1859.199 --> 1866.009
very like very suggestible again a part

1863.099 --> 1869.4289999999999
of the aberration just because that

1866.009 --> 1871.859
acceleration is natural part of the

1869.429 --> 1874.769
effects doesn't mean that there must be

1871.859 --> 1876.629
a force causing that because when forces

1874.769 --> 1880.889
are applied to something it does also

1876.629 --> 1883.319
show the same symptoms that's just yeah

1880.889 --> 1885.9289999999999
that's that's one of the pitfalls that

1883.319 --> 1888.479
the original scientific method was

1885.929 --> 1889.47
constructed for to keep people down to

1888.479 --> 1892.07
earth

1889.47 --> 1894.21
and not wander off into crazy-long

1892.07 --> 1896.61
presuppositional structures of thinking

1894.21 --> 1899.159
oh it's keeping it like yeah it's really

1896.61 --> 1902.4599999999998
nice but you gotta start out with all

1899.159 --> 1905.5800000000002
proven factors or we're not gonna take

1902.46 --> 1907.74
it series that's the scientific method

1905.58 --> 1909.78
and that's really what it why it's so

1907.74 --> 1912.51
important because it's like an anchor

1909.78 --> 1914.85
point it's a solid foundation that

1912.51 --> 1918.809
prevents you from wandering off into

1914.85 --> 1927.1789999999999
eternal presuppositional speculation to

1918.809 --> 1933.8899999999999
suicide Reilly you're still there all

1927.179 --> 1933.89
right he's busy

1944.269 --> 1952.089
yeah still one of the the more puzzling

1947.989 --> 1956.299
elements to me is the suspension of the

1952.089 --> 1960.109
relative density and that's basically

1956.299 --> 1963.529
what you should call it when well the

1960.109 --> 1965.749
format comet setup when yeah the effect

1963.529 --> 1968.629
is completely neutralized by a very

1965.749 --> 1972.32
specific type of motion accelerated

1968.629 --> 1975.649
motion to basically get neutralized a

1972.32 --> 1977.389
relative density effect and you can

1975.649 --> 1979.4499999999998
assume that before the force

1977.389 --> 1981.7389999999998
disequilibrium is being countered by a

1979.45 --> 1984.95
motion force that's the other way to

1981.739 --> 1989.919
approach it but technically it is the

1984.95 --> 1993.8890000000001
relative density effect being suspended

1989.919 --> 1995.659
yeah and please don't no longer seek a

1993.889 --> 1998.359
certain relative level to one another

1995.659 --> 2000.519
because yeah the relative density no

1998.359 --> 2003.579
longer functions and then when the

2000.519 --> 2006.279
normal position is taken suddenly things

2003.579 --> 2009.039
start yeah there the relative density

2006.279 --> 2012.009
this equilibrium comes back into being

2009.039 --> 2014.049
and causes the forces the force this

2012.009 --> 2016.989
equilibrium so things start to find

2014.049 --> 2018.759
their their level again it within the

2016.989 --> 2022.8690000000001
relative density spectrum of the

2018.759 --> 2025.69
container oh and how that how that works

2022.869 --> 2029.019
oh and how on earth does super curve say

2025.69 --> 2030.909
this if we have no net acceleration in

2029.019 --> 2031.8990000000001
other words it's in a state of what they

2030.909 --> 2034.959
call neutrally buoyant

2031.899 --> 2037.599
we have no net force proves weight is a

2034.959 --> 2040.239
force how do you go from having no

2037.599 --> 2041.799
movement to prove that proving weight as

2040.239 --> 2043.599
a force that's nonsense you are

2041.799 --> 2045.219
literally I don't even know how that

2043.599 --> 2048.399
makes sense that it doesn't it's

2045.219 --> 2050.349
relatively it's a broken statement it

2048.399 --> 2052.8689999999997
makes it doesn't follow logically right

2050.349 --> 2055.0
I want to know if you're a fool and you

2052.869 --> 2057.339
think that the Wampus is correct and he

2055.0 --> 2060.669
says that weights are force in my in

2057.339 --> 2061.929
maths this doesn't say that Rob the

2060.669 --> 2064.5389999999998
state introduced that weights of force

2061.929 --> 2067.419
no what no then he changed his stance

2064.539 --> 2069.579
you said it's a fictitious force yeah

2067.419 --> 2071.529
well it is still call it forced oh yeah

2069.579 --> 2073.539
but cuz he says wait when elaborated

2071.529 --> 2075.7
upon it says not really it's a

2073.539 --> 2078.21
fictitious force it's not a force but

2075.7 --> 2082.0
you can take it as a force

2078.21 --> 2083.86
that but wrong leaves listen rompers

2082.0 --> 2085.93
does say that weights are force and I

2083.86 --> 2088.15
only know if weight if weight really is

2085.93 --> 2091.0
a force was the scientific evidence the

2088.15 --> 2092.4700000000003
scientific proof that the mass times the

2091.0 --> 2093.94
gravitational constant where's the

2092.47 --> 2096.0099999999998
gravitational that where's the

2093.94 --> 2099.55
gravitational bit that supports the the

2096.01 --> 2100.78
mass being added to to prove it causes

2099.55 --> 2102.3100000000004
somewhat because I want to know where

2100.78 --> 2104.11
that that the gravitational bit

2102.31 --> 2114.21
afterwards comes from where is that

2104.11 --> 2116.4700000000003
proof now just grafted arm [ __ ]

2114.21 --> 2118.7200000000003
weight is the pull of gravity on an

2116.47 --> 2120.8799999999997
object the more the more mass of the

2118.72 --> 2123.31
object has the more gravity will pull on

2120.88 --> 2124.7200000000003
it but that's the density increasing the

2123.31 --> 2126.46
more matter an object has the more

2124.72 --> 2128.47
gravity will pull on it yeah also the

2126.46 --> 2130.42
density increases however your weight

2128.47 --> 2131.83
can change based on where you are the

2130.42 --> 2133.84
moon is different gravity than the earth

2131.83 --> 2137.2599999999998
can we see that proof please by the way

2133.84 --> 2139.2400000000002
that's not entirely true it doesn't

2137.26 --> 2141.25
matter if the weight increases the force

2139.24 --> 2143.7999999999997
will not increase the force is actually

2141.25 --> 2146.5
constant you can it the assumed force

2143.8 --> 2149.05
right there they say they come let me

2146.5 --> 2153.34
finish because if you're standing on a

2149.05 --> 2155.11
cliff and you drop a small rock exactly

2153.34 --> 2157.36
at the same time as a pretty big rock

2155.11 --> 2160.0
you'll notice that they'll accelerate if

2157.36 --> 2161.76
their densities are the same despite

2160.0 --> 2164.35
their total weight the total size

2161.76 --> 2170.01
acceleration will be pretty much exactly

2164.35 --> 2173.2
the same yeah by passing air friction

2170.01 --> 2174.46
effects that not taking that into

2173.2 --> 2175.7799999999997
account because there is a difference

2174.46 --> 2177.73
because of the size with the air

2175.78 --> 2179.98
friction but they will basically have

2177.73 --> 2182.5
the same acceleration rate acceleration

2179.98 --> 2184.75
like it doesn't start accelerating more

2182.5 --> 2187.24
just because it has more weights because

2184.75 --> 2194.67
it is bigger with more combined weight

2187.24 --> 2194.6699999999996
that doesn't happen mmm I agree yes

2196.61 --> 2199.6490000000003
[Music]

2204.849 --> 2214.73
it's law of gravitation yeah sorry we

2211.7 --> 2217.0299999999997
don't abide by that law thank you very

2214.73 --> 2217.03
much

2228.369 --> 2235.339
gravity is not a law it's a concept it's

2231.5 --> 2237.7
a conceptual structure a framework as I

2235.339 --> 2240.98
keep on calling it that's what it is

2237.7 --> 2244.16
it's not in law you can definitely

2240.98 --> 2247.839
bypass it using other approaches as we

2244.16 --> 2251.589
have you through relative density Theory

2247.839 --> 2251.589
no it's not a law

2256.83 --> 2262.64
God metering Baba just give me 2 sec

2259.62 --> 2265.35
I'll read out ok no problem

2262.64 --> 2268.92
yeah if anyone else wants to join by the

2265.35 --> 2271.5499999999997
way this conversation that could also be

2268.92 --> 2271.55
interesting

2276.26 --> 2287.9
what is that Oh Jesse also wants to join

2279.41 --> 2290.3799999999997
in don't turn me into a troll okay okay

2287.9 --> 2290.38
Jesse

2305.78 --> 2322.9100000000003
who didn't know she's still gonna pick

2308.51 --> 2327.38
up Wow

2322.91 --> 2330.29
well Ellie be a law in science just

2327.38 --> 2333.56
means a description no no no it's

2330.29 --> 2336.35
claimed literally the super curve is

2333.56 --> 2340.37
claiming that gravity is a natural law

2336.35 --> 2344.39
and that's just not true they call it

2340.37 --> 2348.02
Newton's law it's never ever said to be

2344.39 --> 2354.23
a natural law it's like a separate rule

2348.02 --> 2357.23
system a conceptual framework which kind

2354.23 --> 2360.02
of pans out again it's a framework it's

2357.23 --> 2362.21
like a mathematical approach that ties

2360.02 --> 2364.64
in a lot of factors through certain

2362.21 --> 2366.4700000000003
settings and presuppositions and it kind

2364.64 --> 2369.47
of works out as long as you don't

2366.47 --> 2373.0099999999998
started yeah start turning it all into

2369.47 --> 2375.5299999999997
ball [ __ ] which is achievable through

2373.01 --> 2378.23
math because it is a framework in math

2375.53 --> 2379.82
and you can craft whatever nonsense you

2378.23 --> 2384.38
want in there technically and they have

2379.82 --> 2391.5800000000004
over the ages it's not a freakin law of

2384.38 --> 2395.7400000000002
nature of gravitation that's really just

2391.58 --> 2395.74
abominable it's just disgusting

2400.329 --> 2403.9990000000003
yeah if you're gonna be repeating that

2402.769 --> 2406.089
[ __ ] I'm gonna have the time you know

2403.999 --> 2408.4889999999996
it's just disgusting calling that a law

2406.089 --> 2411.38
some nonsense

2408.489 --> 2414.829
it's a conceptual framework and that's

2411.38 --> 2417.829
it it's no law there's no nothing

2414.829 --> 2419.4990000000003
forcing us to use that approach even

2417.829 --> 2424.6400000000003
though it's so convenient

2419.499 --> 2428.779
nothing is forcing us to do that you can

2424.64 --> 2432.709
definitely use other approaches so it's

2428.779 --> 2433.849
not a law you like to see you do the

2432.709 --> 2437.39
same thing with the laws of

2433.849 --> 2440.089
thermodynamics you know that's a law

2437.39 --> 2442.8489999999997
those are laws because you can escape it

2440.089 --> 2445.369
well you can escape gravity and they

2442.849 --> 2447.349
said not in the literal eyes that just

2445.369 --> 2451.309
came out all wrong but you can

2447.349 --> 2454.279
definitely use another approach than

2451.309 --> 2457.9390000000003
gravity that can actually be more

2454.279 --> 2462.769
grounded in physical reality and the

2457.939 --> 2466.779
scientific method as we have so there's

2462.769 --> 2466.779
no law of gravity nonsense

2486.539 --> 2500.1890000000003
Baldr wankers but yet today it can be

2496.649 --> 2502.259
used to make predictions yeah yes super

2500.189 --> 2504.8689999999997
curve or am I getting through to you

2502.259 --> 2510.119
super curve that's what I said it's a

2504.869 --> 2512.789
conceptual frame work yeah that can

2510.119 --> 2515.7290000000003
definitely definitely be used to make

2512.789 --> 2519.029
predictions that's what it's made for

2515.729 --> 2523.549
it's not grounded in provable physical

2519.029 --> 2524.699
reality though it's just a framework to

2523.549 --> 2528.599
overarch

2524.699 --> 2541.349
a lot of things in a very simplistic way

2528.599 --> 2544.079
that kind of pans out a framework yeah

2541.349 --> 2547.2290000000003
it's really nice to be able to make

2544.079 --> 2549.509
predictions with things you know because

2547.229 --> 2551.609
as soon as you make predictions based on

2549.509 --> 2560.489
any system then it must be a law

2551.609 --> 2563.5789999999997
apparently it's just ridiculous no you

2560.489 --> 2565.949
can't go in physics in which

2563.579 --> 2569.429
specifically like is in the world as in

2565.949 --> 2572.039
physical physics you can't just start

2569.429 --> 2574.849
calling things based on conceptual

2572.039 --> 2578.3990000000003
frameworks loss that's ridiculous

2574.849 --> 2580.1090000000004
in order to even start to be able to

2578.399 --> 2583.499
call something a law you're gonna have

2580.109 --> 2586.799
to scientifically prove all the elements

2583.499 --> 2590.509
in some way or proof that there is

2586.799 --> 2593.819
absolutely no way around it in some way

2590.509 --> 2598.139
and there isn't there is there are ways

2593.819 --> 2601.319
around it absolutely that are much more

2598.139 --> 2603.7690000000002
grounded in physical reality because you

2601.319 --> 2607.339
can actually scientifically prove it

2603.769 --> 2607.339
isn't that just nice

2610.96 --> 2614.07
[Music]

2615.91 --> 2627.56
yeah that's fine Billy wasa but I just I

2624.62 --> 2630.17
just get a really bad feeling when I

2627.56 --> 2633.11
start to see people in my chat that I

2630.17 --> 2635.66
know start saying boo boo boo is

2633.11 --> 2637.7000000000003
[ __ ] that kind of [ __ ] you have no

2635.66 --> 2641.0299999999997
freaking idea what you're talking about

2637.7 --> 2644.1499999999996
when you say that I like on the spot

2641.03 --> 2647.3300000000004
yesterday explained very elaborately

2644.15 --> 2649.19
what the Bible probably is to just

2647.33 --> 2652.43
outright say it is [ __ ] because

2649.19 --> 2656.21
there are yeah religious cults out there

2652.43 --> 2659.47
that basically cherry-pick things in the

2656.21 --> 2662.48
Bible and use it as mind control

2659.47 --> 2664.8799999999997
operations that has nothing to do with

2662.48 --> 2667.19
the freaking book you can almost use any

2664.88 --> 2669.38
book like that it's just one of the most

2667.19 --> 2671.5
traditionally longest used books with

2669.38 --> 2674.78
that with the theocracy and all that

2671.5 --> 2679.13
that doesn't make the Bible [ __ ] it

2674.78 --> 2683.15
just the people that use that book but

2679.13 --> 2686.03
like you have [ __ ] with them if you

2683.15 --> 2687.53
say that now they're you'd be on to

2686.03 --> 2694.28
something but I don't call the Bible

2687.53 --> 2695.84
[ __ ] that's just it feels weird to

2694.28 --> 2698.42
say but that's just blasphemy that's

2695.84 --> 2701.1800000000003
just stupid it's ignorance to say that

2698.42 --> 2705.98
and I don't like people that do that

2701.18 --> 2709.0299999999997
like you know gets in like an allergic

2705.98 --> 2709.03
reaction out of me

2712.509 --> 2720.249
you know you can't call something

2716.45 --> 2723.68
[ __ ] especially when I've definitely

2720.249 --> 2727.359
experienced in in multiple ways that the

2723.68 --> 2730.19
Bible has a lot of strength and a lot of

2727.359 --> 2734.499
influence in it and it seems to be a

2730.19 --> 2739.2200000000003
multiple multiple angle interpretive

2734.499 --> 2743.8999999999996
interpretable book full with wonders

2739.22 --> 2745.999
like wonders of meaning and an even

2743.9 --> 2748.4300000000003
encrypted stuff and just did the

2745.999 --> 2751.9599999999996
Gnosticism that's also in it's such a

2748.43 --> 2756.41
huge thing you can't call that [ __ ]

2751.96 --> 2760.279
it's just [ __ ] it's way too complex

2756.41 --> 2761.8999999999996
to just be [ __ ] and there's

2760.279 --> 2764.45
something magical to that the whole

2761.9 --> 2767.239
thing I call it it's a multi-dimensional

2764.45 --> 2771.3489999999997
book because no matter how you approach

2767.239 --> 2780.109
it it will show you the it'll work out

2771.349 --> 2786.17
that's yeah I treat the Bible like it's

2780.109 --> 2789.22
a very special artifact that's not a

2786.17 --> 2794.9
specific item but just the writing is

2789.22 --> 2798.89
the artifact the whole the whole writing

2794.9 --> 2802.69
of it anyway I don't know where Riley is

2798.89 --> 2802.69
seems to be very silent

2811.89 --> 2816.35
well peanuts Clark I don't think that

2816.38 --> 2824.46
like there was a separate witness to

2820.44 --> 2827.25
God's creation I think that pretty much

2824.46 --> 2830.07
the God that supposedly did that has

2827.25 --> 2832.59
probably passed on what he did and

2830.07 --> 2834.27
that's how the story unfolded I don't

2832.59 --> 2837.3500000000004
think there was a witness around to see

2834.27 --> 2837.35
creation happening

2856.42 --> 2862.9300000000003
all right yeah Ernest Hemmingway I think

2860.44 --> 2864.579
you got me yeah that's I don't know why

2862.93 --> 2868.779
the atomic clock thing

2864.579 --> 2871.1090000000004
it's weird I don't get it and even

2868.779 --> 2876.19
though there is like the actual

2871.109 --> 2880.5099999999998
significance of it it is presupposed

2876.19 --> 2883.15
that literally time is varying due to

2880.51 --> 2884.5890000000004
the proximity of the center of gravity

2883.15 --> 2887.829
with that one

2884.589 --> 2890.2599999999998
but basically what it states is that the

2887.829 --> 2895.42
effect of radioactivity can apparently

2890.26 --> 2898.9
be varied slightly due to natural

2895.42 --> 2901.089
position or position within the total

2898.9 --> 2903.369
pressure system it's it's all a matter

2901.089 --> 2904.99
of what is actually causing that well

2903.369 --> 2907.809
that's fascinating but all it's really

2904.99 --> 2912.91
proving is that radioactivity is not as

2907.809 --> 2916.44
perfectly constant as is assumed because

2912.91 --> 2919.69
that is effectively what is happening

2916.44 --> 2921.819
the radiation deterioration is slightly

2919.69 --> 2924.15
speeding up as you go higher up that's

2921.819 --> 2928.619
why it time seems to go faster on that

2924.15 --> 2928.619
clock because the time is basically

2929.19 --> 2935.529
deduced from that effect that is assumed

2932.68 --> 2938.3799999999997
to be constant but basically with that

2935.529 --> 2940.66
doing that it's proven not to be that

2938.38 --> 2942.609
constant but then to assume that it is

2940.66 --> 2945.94
time that is not constant well time is

2942.609 --> 2950.109
basically a pure deduction based concept

2945.94 --> 2955.2000000000003
that's kind of like yeah science fiction

2950.109 --> 2959.259
double thing so it is what it is

2955.2 --> 2962.91
apparently the radioactive element of

2959.259 --> 2966.22
cesium which is used in in atomic clocks

2962.91 --> 2969.19
the the radiation effect of it that is a

2966.22 --> 2971.8289999999997
natural part of it starts to vary its

2969.19 --> 2976.0190000000002
output if you change the position

2971.829 --> 2980.049
laterally in the world so that is weird

2976.019 --> 2984.279
but it does absolutely not prove that

2980.049 --> 2987.13
time is very ating because time is a

2984.279 --> 2989.38
deduced concept based on the

2987.13 --> 2990.1400000000003
interactions of matter and the

2989.38 --> 2993.7400000000002
assumption of

2990.14 --> 2995.839
constant a constant element to that yeah

2993.74 --> 2997.8799999999997
if you know what I would I had farmers

2995.839 --> 3000.19
boy trying to tell me that he was able

2997.88 --> 3002.7690000000002
to manipulate time and he's neat old

3000.19 --> 3004.69
hangout that he'd moved time by 20

3002.769 --> 3006.91
seconds so I said to him does that mean

3004.69 --> 3007.869
although now a 20 second delay to me

3006.91 --> 3010.269
because it sounds like you're still

3007.869 --> 3011.799
contemporaneous and I'm it kind of dish

3010.269 --> 3013.1189999999997
destroys his argument completely what

3011.799 --> 3015.059
nobody can manipulate time it's a

3013.119 --> 3017.5
man-made constant in the congo time

3015.059 --> 3021.01
manipulate time for 20 seconds like he

3017.5 --> 3023.079
would take 20 seconds away yeah Wow so

3021.01 --> 3025.539
that literally means that from now on

3023.079 --> 3028.0
he's 20 seconds [ __ ] compared to the

3025.539 --> 3036.809
rest of the world and then came back

3028.0 --> 3036.809
again silly what's a [ __ ] it's fantasy

3037.14 --> 3043.5989999999997
it's fascinating though but still yeah

3040.24 --> 3047.019
every time we try to establish time it's

3043.599 --> 3049.539
always a deduction or based system on

3047.019 --> 3052.89
some physical interaction because that

3049.539 --> 3057.2200000000003
is how time is established through the

3052.89 --> 3062.23
the constants of the entropy of matter

3057.22 --> 3065.8489999999997
in all kinds of way ways of chemical

3062.23 --> 3068.349
change chemical transition radioactivity

3065.849 --> 3071.349
constants that is how time is

3068.349 --> 3073.7200000000003
established electrical natural pulses

3071.349 --> 3076.089
maybaby that's like magnetic base like

3073.72 --> 3079.019
quartz crystal that's using watches and

3076.089 --> 3082.9
everything that's also a constant effect

3079.019 --> 3086.519
so it's always elements within nature

3082.9 --> 3091.059
that have a constants which are used to

3086.519 --> 3092.3489999999997
deduce time with are we I'm gonna I'm

3091.059 --> 3093.4900000000002
gonna drop and jump on to Nathan's

3092.349 --> 3096.009
you're gonna join me because I want to

3093.49 --> 3097.2099999999996
miss it this perspective argument by him

3096.009 --> 3100.2690000000002
and just tell him how it just seems too

3097.21 --> 3101.559
much curvature right okay no that's

3100.269 --> 3103.5389999999998
funny I was gonna run out to show a

3101.559 --> 3107.619
thanks for coming then all this pleasure

3103.539 --> 3111.88
do come again okay alright see in the

3107.619 --> 3113.799
debates okay

3111.88 --> 3116.13
so that was good like the show today

3113.799 --> 3119.73
even though

3116.13 --> 3122.2200000000003
yeah my nose sounds a bit stuffed

3119.73 --> 3125.13
even though it's not that bad so yeah

3122.22 --> 3127.1699999999996
thanks everyone for coming and I hope

3125.13 --> 3129.9300000000003
you enjoyed the show if you have please

3127.17 --> 3131.37
don't forget to upload it and subscribe

3129.93 --> 3132.7799999999997
if you haven't already and hit the bell

3131.37 --> 3135.0899999999997
notification so you know when I'm gonna

3132.78 --> 3137.82
going live which is normally to be mm so

3135.09 --> 3141.84
damn time and please also don't forget

3137.82 --> 3146.07
to support me preferably through PayPal

3141.84 --> 3148.8
