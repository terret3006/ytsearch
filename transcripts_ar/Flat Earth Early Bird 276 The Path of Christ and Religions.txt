5.85 --> 40.72
[Music]

31.42 --> 44.260000000000005
ooh morning welcome to flatter the

40.72 --> 46.089999999999996
earlybird number 276 I'm your host

44.26 --> 47.8
Arwen and before I start the show please

46.09 --> 50.440000000000005
don't forget to share it on any platform

47.8 --> 51.97
you deem fit and also if you haven't

50.44 --> 53.53
already subscribed to my channel and hit

51.97 --> 55.18
the bell notification so you know when

53.53 --> 57.4
I'm going live which is normally 2:00

55.18 --> 59.62
p.m. Amsterdam time every day

57.4 --> 61.78
please also support my channel through

59.62 --> 65.53
the super chats paypal patreon and my

61.78 --> 71.35
GoFundMe much obliged so the weather

65.53 --> 73.8
today is nice it's ah the Sun was just

71.35 --> 78.009
caught behind a couple of clouds but

73.8 --> 79.869
it's been a nice day yeah some of those

78.009 --> 81.97
clouds look pretty big but I haven't

79.869 --> 84.729
really experienced any rain so far and

81.97 --> 87.789
it's still nice and warm especially when

84.729 --> 91.0
the Sun the Sun comes out from beneath

87.789 --> 95.43900000000001
the clouds but also yesterday night

91.0 --> 97.75
before I went to bed I think there was a

95.439 --> 100.6
full moon or almost a full moon and it

97.75 --> 103.079
was a really clear sky so that thing was

100.6 --> 106.0
just staring at me

103.079 --> 109.119
it was weird I was kind of uncomfortable

106.0 --> 113.229
with the moon and I be aware before I

109.119 --> 115.27
went yeah went to bed did an extra

113.229 --> 118.299
prayer kind of for protection because it

115.27 --> 122.079
almost feels like there's a lot of dark

118.299 --> 125.64
activity going around spawning from

122.079 --> 129.07
desperation yeah

125.64 --> 131.53
an evil moon that's kind of like what it

129.07 --> 135.28
felt I haven't I have not looked up a

131.53 --> 137.26
single thing I swear it it's just just

135.28 --> 142.81
doing my thing outside and felt like

137.26 --> 146.29
this that doesn't feel good didn't feel

142.81 --> 151.06
like a like I liked it maybe if I yeah

146.29 --> 153.64
again if I would be in a on the other

151.06 --> 157.18
side this would actually be drawing me

153.64 --> 160.98899999999998
outside little howl at the moon as they

157.18 --> 162.09900000000002
say but I'm not like that anymore so it

160.989 --> 164.959
was just repulse

162.099 --> 171.959
yeah repulsive to me

164.959 --> 176.4
anyway let's seeyou is in chat not such

171.959 --> 180.5
an activity today a DM was first Amanda

176.4 --> 185.909
you see you flats oi defi and I'm gonna

180.5 --> 189.329
get him on the panel in a while

185.909 --> 193.56
search echo brand M good to see you uber

189.329 --> 203.4
moko lumberjack Ali B I saw your

193.56 --> 206.299
livestream this morning Ragnar Stefan

203.4 --> 210.239
held us and yeah good to see you

206.299 --> 212.4
so yeah I'm gonna talk about hopefully

210.239 --> 215.159
more Flat Earth or science related

212.4 --> 221.909
subjects and there didn't yesterday was

215.159 --> 225.45
amazing after debates yeah you might

221.909 --> 229.07899999999998
have caught it in that the at the

225.45 --> 230.31
debates premiering of the after show I

229.079 --> 233.19
think it was last night

230.31 --> 235.049
but at some point Adam came in and he

233.19 --> 236.94
said like there's some stuff but I don't

235.049 --> 241.769
want to know a record well that went on

236.94 --> 244.019
for hours and it it was almost

241.769 --> 247.439
heart-wrenching that that wasn't

244.019 --> 248.519
recorded because it was awesome it was

247.439 --> 252.84
so cool

248.519 --> 256.229
there was like a new level of data it

252.84 --> 259.38
felt like we were there on a special

256.229 --> 262.169
special science class where we get the

259.38 --> 264.15
next level away from it it felt like

262.169 --> 266.159
that and it was so awesome and I got a

264.15 --> 268.67999999999995
whole new level of understanding from

266.159 --> 270.57
this connecting things that are

268.68 --> 276.47
apparently very relevant in quantum

270.57 --> 278.759
mechanics it was mainly about the

276.47 --> 283.139
consideration of how gas pressure and

278.759 --> 286.68
all fluids function that everything that

283.139 --> 288.72
can move within a fluid is basically

286.68 --> 291.12
going to randomly move perfectly

288.72 --> 295.16900000000004
randomly and that's a theoretically

291.12 --> 297.9
because the concept that's part of the

295.169 --> 303.31
concept it moves in all direction ran

297.9 --> 307.27
until everything is in balance as it

303.31 --> 309.91
were and it has to do with yeah whatever

307.27 --> 313.35999999999996
the state of the fluid is in it has a

309.91 --> 316.42
certain amount of options as where the

313.36 --> 319.3
randomness what type of choices between

316.42 --> 322.69
random it has how many options does it

319.3 --> 325.98
have and the less options it has the

322.69 --> 329.77
more inclined it is to actually start

325.98 --> 333.73
changing and changing the shape changing

329.77 --> 338.2
however it is divided and then it gets

333.73 --> 341.19
back to the maximum amount of randomized

338.2 --> 344.65
options for this motion and that is

341.19 --> 346.93
basically in equilibrium it's

344.65 --> 348.78999999999996
fascinating because it can be tied in

346.93 --> 353.23
with relative density and it just

348.79 --> 358.5
clicked for me right away and it's

353.23 --> 366.88
always lovely to learn new stuff so yeah

358.5 --> 370.83
flats Lloyd was there as well and yeah

366.88 --> 370.83
maybe we can talk a little bit about it

374.94 --> 384.9
oh wait that was after you left no

380.52 --> 388.14
that's kinda sad oh well well that point

384.9 --> 390.65999999999997
was basically it is just the another

388.14 --> 392.76
approach to equilibrium and

390.66 --> 398.79
disequilibrium and we were trying to

392.76 --> 401.01
figure out the cause of a wider thing

398.79 --> 404.70000000000005
and I'm not gonna even yeah it was asked

401.01 --> 407.67
specifically not to reveal that because

404.7 --> 410.25
it was experimental and I'm not going to

407.67 --> 412.62
but this piece of data was still

410.25 --> 423.87
revealed to me and it was really nice to

412.62 --> 441.56
understand that right so yeah I'm gonna

423.87 --> 443.04
call in that side hope you're ready hey

441.56 --> 452.51
how's it going

443.04 --> 465.78000000000003
yeah doing great how are you doing yeah

452.51 --> 469.82
we're yeah right away now the summer so

465.78 --> 472.38
you got like this spring break moment

469.82 --> 475.2
because that is like the unique moment

472.38 --> 477.78
like right before spring kind of in the

475.2 --> 482.95
end of winter so that would make sense

477.78 --> 484.82
you got urea your southern hemisphere or

482.95 --> 489.69
[Music]

484.82 --> 494.3
it's hard to it's the spring break on

489.69 --> 494.3
the other half south of the Equator

507.56 --> 519.65
indeed why or what your crackling a lot

510.99 --> 523.41
by way the reception is better

519.65 --> 529.38
yeah little it's still crackling a lot

523.41 --> 532.11
but anyway yeah yeah you've been that

529.38 --> 535.47
panel a regular panel member on the

532.11 --> 539.64
debates for a while now and it's it's

535.47 --> 541.53
cool because I've that everyone comes

539.64 --> 543.6
and goes in the in the panel you know

541.53 --> 547.4599999999999
it's been the show's become for so long

543.6 --> 551.88
but I feel that we really built a new

547.46 --> 553.89
group kind of like all these like 10th

551.88 --> 555.63
man seems to be kind of like a

553.89 --> 559.35
cornerstone you're coming you're

555.63 --> 562.47
regularly there datian has become he's

559.35 --> 566.73
he's very busy but he's also and if a

562.47 --> 568.4100000000001
half on half off regular and where we

566.73 --> 570.9300000000001
seem to be on the same level and feels

568.41 --> 575.04
kind of good yeah

570.93 --> 576.5699999999999
actually I like the can I say the panel

575.04 --> 582.12
is the different personalities and it

576.57 --> 583.37
actually tells well yeah okay and I mean

582.12 --> 585.42
you were still the one that actually

583.37 --> 587.91
invited me to mostly be in the first

585.42 --> 591.65
place Thanks

587.91 --> 598.56
yeah you're welcome glad you took it

591.65 --> 601.53
yeah I was before yeah oh no no no keep

598.56 --> 603.03
on going I'll ask after no I said before

601.53 --> 605.6
went on the panel I actually was

603.03 --> 609.03
watching Nathan only for a few months

605.6 --> 612.39
you know checking out around what's

609.03 --> 614.87
going on I mean I've only really came

612.39 --> 620.03
into the flat earth since last year so

614.87 --> 626.42
I've been there too long all right so

620.03 --> 629.25
yeah how what was the your insights

626.42 --> 631.74
right before that because if you got in

629.25 --> 635.1
pretty late that's pretty yeah there's a

631.74 --> 638.46
lot of stuff to then basically work

635.1 --> 639.03
through to get on the level where we're

638.46 --> 641.19
at

639.03 --> 642.9
so must be much tougher than for

641.19 --> 646.5
somebody that's been here around for

642.9 --> 651.0
four years got to follow it all so how

646.5 --> 653.16
was that that transition it was actually

651.0 --> 655.65
quite simple for me this is the even

653.16 --> 658.29
like Nathan says it was just oh it's

655.65 --> 658.77
that kind of thing and then took it from

658.29 --> 662.0999999999999
there

658.77 --> 663.72
I mean I just research the subject also

662.1 --> 667.86
said that can't be true and tried to

663.72 --> 669.27
debunk and I was trying to debunk it I

667.86 --> 677.61
figured out no yeah something's not

669.27 --> 680.73
right okay so you did try to debunk it I

677.61 --> 682.14
think 90% of us to do track I don't

680.73 --> 688.65
think we're just gonna walk into a blind

682.14 --> 696.47
guy well I kind of didn't try to debunk

688.65 --> 700.41
it I just wanted to see how it works

696.47 --> 703.65
yeah it's like I'm what I'm more curious

700.41 --> 707.55
about with the whole globe is how it's

703.65 --> 711.09
actually built how the consciousness is

707.55 --> 712.8599999999999
basically being also displaced within

711.09 --> 714.48
the framework of what they all built

712.86 --> 716.37
with all the machinations and all the

714.48 --> 718.53
tactics and all the peer pressure and

716.37 --> 720.59
I'm just fascinated from an outside

718.53 --> 725.68
perspective because I used to be there

720.59 --> 727.72
to kind of emulate what's happening

725.68 --> 732.7589999999999
because it is like you're under a spell

727.72 --> 734.86
over there everything works I mean I try

732.759 --> 737.47
and explain to people just cuz your

734.86 --> 738.6990000000001
globe model works it's based on what

737.47 --> 741.129
you're observing it doesn't mean that

738.699 --> 743.29
that is reality I mean they've been

741.129 --> 748.9590000000001
refining it through the time to make it

743.29 --> 753.55
work right well and also just finding

748.959 --> 757.3889999999999
more tricks to fool you with there's a

753.55 --> 759.639
whole pile of tricks all in a row that

757.389 --> 764.319
are the basic superficial beliefs about

759.639 --> 765.85
it and then yeah and if it was good if

764.319 --> 766.99
it was correct from the beginning they

765.85 --> 774.519
wouldn't need to change it the whole

766.99 --> 779.379
time indeed all right so hey by the way

774.519 --> 782.829
you made that video could in response

779.379 --> 784.269
disperse chemo on the run like I was

782.829 --> 789.279
really surprised about that video was

784.269 --> 791.529
really good but where was that let's see

789.279 --> 794.649
at work it's at the back without

791.529 --> 797.92
compressors no because it was last

794.649 --> 799.209
Friday we were the biking and I still

797.92 --> 801.449
couldn't believe this chemo is still

799.209 --> 804.8499999999999
going on about Russia needs water

801.449 --> 806.3789999999999
so I decided okay if you want a

804.85 --> 809.23
continued demonstration you say this

806.379 --> 810.97
it's fun okay Monday did it quick I've

809.23 --> 811.9490000000001
seen the team the whole week is just

810.97 --> 815.47
ignoring me

811.949 --> 818.49
then funny yesterday to Quran yeah as

815.47 --> 821.1990000000001
you can see still just totally

818.49 --> 821.949
obfuscates he just wants to throw me

821.199 --> 825.279
under the bus

821.949 --> 828.8499999999999
well you broke him yesterday it was very

825.279 --> 831.22
obvious you could hear him like he was

828.85 --> 835.48
heartbroken because he realized that he

831.22 --> 837.879
had absolutely nowhere to go and well

835.48 --> 839.9490000000001
Brenda at such a point would go into a

837.879 --> 841.509
fit and then just start completely

839.949 --> 844.329
saying la la la la

841.509 --> 846.809
repeating [ __ ] but he didn't do that he

844.329 --> 852.0999999999999
kind of felt like but I want to go on

846.809 --> 857.649
but I know now I was ready here it I you

852.1 --> 858.99
could feel it doesn't want it material

857.649 --> 862.14
because of him

858.99 --> 864.12
that Ellis Dave or whatever they want to

862.14 --> 867.0
get clear reviewed about it so obviously

864.12 --> 869.55
that only shadow indeed I don't even

867.0 --> 873.589
understand why he even does it I've

869.55 --> 876.63
asked him and he's never responded why

873.589 --> 880.35
what is it you're actually trying to

876.63 --> 883.8
achieve here because I just don't even

880.35 --> 887.82
get what their claim is really except

883.8 --> 890.79
there is no gas pressure yeah except

887.82 --> 892.9200000000001
when it is yeah so there's no gas

890.79 --> 896.79
pressure except when he gives examples

892.92 --> 899.02
with gas pressure so it's it seems to be

896.79 --> 901.04
so fluid pun intended

899.02 --> 904.0799999999999
[Laughter]

901.04 --> 905.88
yeah I don't understand how you can

904.08 --> 908.0400000000001
think there's no gas push outside and

905.88 --> 910.32
then when you take a container and

908.04 --> 911.9699999999999
you're throwing the outside gas pressure

910.32 --> 913.49
into that pressure how can you say

911.97 --> 919.4100000000001
there's not gas pressure distorted

913.49 --> 921.66
exactly and for me just the ability to

919.41 --> 925.4399999999999
breathe which you have to do is already

921.66 --> 928.1899999999999
such proof of that there is just this

925.44 --> 932.2790000000001
pressure and how that works

928.19 --> 934.44
he's never brought that like hey Emma do

932.279 --> 940.649
you breathe are you breathing water

934.44 --> 944.07
right now yeah no we've been through

940.649 --> 946.14
that they put him as well so I haven't

944.07 --> 947.5200000000001
even followed every step of it because

946.14 --> 951.3
it just gave me a headache

947.52 --> 953.52
I said I actually asked Paul this is the

951.3 --> 955.829
time he wanted to be on vacation we each

953.52 --> 964.529
he's was the first main point with the

955.829 --> 970.6099999999999
air conditioning right yeah so here you

964.529 --> 970.61
play World of Warcraft no no I know

971.24 --> 977.85
probably some troll they love to say

974.64 --> 979.77
like oh please everyday they they tried

977.85 --> 983.4200000000001
that even two years ago there's just

979.77 --> 985.52
some trolls out there that like to spam

983.42 --> 989.8
that I'm the World of Warcraft player

985.52 --> 992.21
and I'm I am NOT I've never even tried I

989.8 --> 994.0999999999999
played on somebody else's account and

992.21 --> 997.07
then I got really bored and really I

994.1 --> 999.98
think it's an ugly game sorry it's just

997.07 --> 1002.7700000000001
not my it's not for everybody you know I

999.98 --> 1005.1700000000001
was I wasn't one I was moving come on

1002.77 --> 1008.4399999999999
and conquered I put her all right yes

1005.17 --> 1012.01
strategy games since doom 2 on my Amiga

1008.44 --> 1013.7800000000001
yeah that was the that was the time and

1012.01 --> 1016.42
I still love those games and now it's

1013.78 --> 1019.66
just resolved within like civilization 5

1016.42 --> 1023.4699999999999
and I'm really kind of done yeah I'm

1019.66 --> 1024.97
kind of done like done with the genre

1023.47 --> 1028.329
yeah I want something that you can think

1024.97 --> 1031.27
yeah for me it's kind of like getting an

1028.329 --> 1034.36
old get bored game out of the closet

1031.27 --> 1037.78
except it's on my computer and I've seen

1034.36 --> 1053.1699999999998
it you know what else is there to

1037.78 --> 1057.67
explore with that stuff sorry yes do you

1053.17 --> 1058.63
have to take the call or no no no throw

1057.67 --> 1064.23
something sorry I was just in the office

1058.63 --> 1064.23
ok ok oh no all right no problem

1065.73 --> 1070.6
but anyway yeah with the games you know

1068.35 --> 1073.4499999999998
I've been a computer game addict pretty

1070.6 --> 1079.6
badly and I used it also for escapism

1073.45 --> 1082.03
and it's not yeah well I've been

1079.6 --> 1084.37
fighting so hard to get over it as it

1082.03 --> 1087.6399999999999
were that now it just doesn't have the

1084.37 --> 1089.4399999999998
same appeal to me anymore because I

1087.64 --> 1094.3600000000001
don't want to escape in it anymore

1089.44 --> 1096.31
yeah don't allow myself to do that not

1094.36 --> 1100.7199999999998
much time it actually takes out of

1096.31 --> 1103.99
you're right but it is also really the

1100.72 --> 1106.54
escapist mindset of like really I only

1103.99 --> 1108.64
do that when I'm just very stressed out

1106.54 --> 1111.19
acutely and there's really nothing I can

1108.64 --> 1112.66
do about it then it's just like get in

1111.19 --> 1115.539
the game and become the game forget

1112.66 --> 1119.19
everything else but

1115.539 --> 1123.549
I don't actively seek that out anymore

1119.19 --> 1131.789
as it were and just play sometimes when

1123.549 --> 1131.789
I'm kind of bored to do this sorry

1134.35 --> 1137.039
you

1137.72 --> 1140.6490000000001
okay

1141.91 --> 1156.13

1156.13 --> 1170.0800000000002
gonna keep the mustache why oh why do

1164.23 --> 1172.39

1170.08 --> 1176.26
sideburns is it something you gonna do

1172.39 --> 1178.8400000000001
sideburns well I'm just trying to keep

1176.26 --> 1181.81
them symmetrical as much as possible and

1178.84 --> 1184.03
that's it I'm never gonna get rid of

1181.81 --> 1191.07
them like up to here I think that's kind

1184.03 --> 1193.57
of ya boy

1191.07 --> 1198.85
so you got any topic

1193.57 --> 1203.11
oh yeah anything like what have you been

1198.85 --> 1205.09
watching recently or mm-hmm

1203.11 --> 1207.1
oh my [ __ ] just been on the flattest

1205.09 --> 1209.86
debates of another thing and grantees

1207.1 --> 1215.86
been working a lot Betty alright some

1209.86 --> 1217.9299999999998
sleeping warrior yeah but it's difficult

1215.86 --> 1219.58
because I don't really hate Tom mostly

1217.93 --> 1221.68
working and then when I do get home

1219.58 --> 1224.6499999999999
spend a little bit of time with my

1221.68 --> 1227.23
children and my wife I still try and

1224.65 --> 1227.94
make time for letters and videos and

1227.23 --> 1230.23
whatever

1227.94 --> 1231.76
all right well you've got some people

1230.23 --> 1234.21
you have your wife and children that's

1231.76 --> 1239.37
yeah that's also important of course oh

1234.21 --> 1241.78
well if I to be verifying it that then

1239.37 --> 1243.06
probably would spin yeah I love less

1241.78 --> 1246.1299999999999
Ricki

1243.06 --> 1253.05
yeah I'm working on my videos or

1246.13 --> 1256.0500000000002
whatever not often want to bid sir right

1253.05 --> 1256.05
yeah

1257.25 --> 1264.67
so if you got this a certain diet that

1260.23 --> 1273.49
you keep on yep vegetarian and all

1264.67 --> 1275.98
organic and I filter my water no I do

1273.49 --> 1279.73
appreciate the soil sometimes but I just

1275.98 --> 1282.25
don't want to eat it anymore it's weird

1279.73 --> 1283.89
it's like oh that smells really good

1282.25 --> 1285.4
I'm just glad I don't have to eat it

1283.89 --> 1287.5
it's weird

1285.4 --> 1291.46
look that seems to be what it's now

1287.5 --> 1295.33
become and I'll never be able to let my

1291.46 --> 1300.52
meat I think it's in my South African

1295.33 --> 1305.1699999999998
blood what do you mean and South Africa

1300.52 --> 1309.7
people love meat oh right I'll just like

1305.17 --> 1314.6200000000001
Argentina I don't know if you've had to

1309.7 --> 1321.3300000000002
call you both home what I'm both on both

1314.62 --> 1329.08
homes both on I think in Turkey okay

1321.33 --> 1334.1799999999998
let's like dried up you'll find both

1329.08 --> 1337.1499999999999
dongs some way right yeah I used to like

1334.18 --> 1339.3400000000001
them a lot too but then I figured out

1337.15 --> 1341.1100000000001
there's often a lot of chemicals that

1339.34 --> 1344.8
are just not very healthy on the long

1341.11 --> 1346.6899999999998
run and before I began vegetarian I

1344.8 --> 1349.48
really cut down on eating meat in

1346.69 --> 1352.0
general okay I started eating organic

1349.48 --> 1355.8700000000001
before I said I became vegetarian a long

1352.0 --> 1358.89
time ago so okay yeah I'll try to cut

1355.87 --> 1363.37
down a brown sugar also that's just me

1358.89 --> 1366.94
I've got such a sweet juice yeah yeah

1363.37 --> 1369.58
that's a tough one yeah I'm a kind of

1366.94 --> 1371.29
guy that for Father's Day like instead

1369.58 --> 1378.1799999999998
of condensed milk and I just polished it

1371.29 --> 1378.18
and just like that that's not healthy

1378.9 --> 1386.3400000000001
yeah I don't well I don't even use milk

1382.92 --> 1387.1200000000001
products anymore it's been it kind of

1386.34 --> 1390.059
stayed away

1387.12 --> 1390.6599999999999
I used it kind of well I do eat eats

1390.059 --> 1394.11
though

1390.66 --> 1400.8000000000002
but also in very sorry very small

1394.11 --> 1402.51
quantities more yeah but can you feel

1400.8 --> 1407.57
the difference from when you change the

1402.51 --> 1413.04
diet yes absolutely

1407.57 --> 1414.98
it's a good difference yes it was but it

1413.04 --> 1419.34
also kind of built up to it

1414.98 --> 1421.47
it's weird because decades ago

1419.34 --> 1424.1399999999999
on several occasions I was kind of

1421.47 --> 1427.41
confronted even I can say this even like

1424.14 --> 1431.25
on the other side like yeah you have to

1427.41 --> 1433.47
go there if you don't want to break

1431.25 --> 1435.42
yourself pretty much I was it's like

1433.47 --> 1438.179
been warned on the other side from

1435.42 --> 1441.75
entities I even got like what I could

1438.179 --> 1442.2800000000002
fear out is an invitation from the Hindu

1441.75 --> 1446.37
gods

1442.28 --> 1448.5
basically they proposed to me

1446.37 --> 1451.4099999999999
on the other side in reflection to the

1448.5 --> 1453.87
darkness I was undergoing back then like

1451.41 --> 1457.5800000000002
yeah we in the sanctuary if you just

1453.87 --> 1461.2199999999998
give up eating cow and I was like ah

1457.58 --> 1466.86
okay okay but it's gonna take a while

1461.22 --> 1469.89
and it's done now now it's roughly ten

1466.86 --> 1473.55
years later yeah it was about ten years

1469.89 --> 1480.8600000000001
ago when when I think I experienced that

1473.55 --> 1483.48
and I also have a nice statue yeah

1480.86 --> 1488.1599999999999
showed it but that's definitely Hindu I

1483.48 --> 1491.809
think it's a statue of Brahma and mm-hmm

1488.16 --> 1494.3700000000001
I've always had it I've never been in

1491.809 --> 1497.1
how do you say like a religious

1494.37 --> 1500.52
opposition or fight with the Hindu gods

1497.1 --> 1504.3
I've always been kind of like yeah you

1500.52 --> 1506.01
know yeah they have their issues and

1504.3 --> 1508.86
their problems but they definitely also

1506.01 --> 1512.0
have their good sides and I'm not gonna

1508.86 --> 1513.9799999999998
worship them and but that's been

1512.0 --> 1515.78
that's become kind of an anchor point

1513.98 --> 1517.55
with me in general it's all about the

1515.78 --> 1522.17
worship like don't worship as well

1517.55 --> 1525.62
anything just respect and understand

1522.17 --> 1532.16
it's more like a lifestyle of study

1525.62 --> 1535.1
going to what do you mean got it it sort

1532.16 --> 1535.96
of gives you guidelines and how you want

1535.1 --> 1539.4099999999999
to live

1535.96 --> 1542.93
Hinduism you mean yeah

1539.41 --> 1545.42
also yeah and it's a huge library of

1542.93 --> 1550.52
knowledge and it's just interesting

1545.42 --> 1552.95
because they have their own logos in

1550.52 --> 1556.28
their own way it's a different strand

1552.95 --> 1559.3400000000001
from the the Bible and everything but

1556.28 --> 1563.56
they have it from their own side and

1559.34 --> 1566.36
it's just a little different I think and

1563.56 --> 1569.6
has its own yeah the same amounts of

1566.36 --> 1572.0
issues and blessings maybe but in a

1569.6 --> 1574.48
different way it's always yeah I've

1572.0 --> 1580.96
always been like I'll just stay neutral

1574.48 --> 1582.98
with this but at the end of the day

1580.96 --> 1587.39
today everybody has to make their own

1582.98 --> 1589.07
decisions on choices indeed yeah and I

1587.39 --> 1594.5900000000001
think there's also still kind of

1589.07 --> 1598.1899999999998
development in it because it said like

1594.59 --> 1601.9599999999998
Hinduism is such a vast library of

1598.19 --> 1605.8600000000001
knowledge and back in ancient times

1601.96 --> 1608.8400000000001
spawned scientists and Cosmo genus even

1605.86 --> 1612.9199999999998
really to go out and just figure things

1608.84 --> 1616.75
out and that is in there that is within

1612.92 --> 1620.0900000000001
the contents

1616.75 --> 1623.45
yeah of that field of of that religion

1620.09 --> 1626.4499999999998
of of that body of knowledge so I think

1623.45 --> 1628.73
it's probably very dynamic and could

1626.45 --> 1630.14
evolve into the future as well I don't

1628.73 --> 1635.18
know it sounds kind of weird to say that

1630.14 --> 1637.25
there's an outsider but yeah but it has

1635.18 --> 1640.13
to everything has to be evolved it keeps

1637.25 --> 1642.32
on building and then sometimes knowledge

1640.13 --> 1644.0
gets locked in and under control they're

1642.32 --> 1645.29
not Fisk aidid and then later it's

1644.0 --> 1654.2
rediscovered and

1645.29 --> 1655.97
and things revolve from them okay isn't

1654.2 --> 1660.5900000000001
it no more seems like what's going on

1655.97 --> 1663.05
with Christianity for example your Sitz

1660.59 --> 1666.59
kind being pushed away and then it makes

1663.05 --> 1668.4199999999998
a comeback from the grassroots more at

1666.59 --> 1671.3899999999999
the same time there's just the the

1668.42 --> 1674.78
churching system seems to be getting

1671.39 --> 1675.47
more strangled and corrupted more

1674.78 --> 1677.1499999999999
pressured

1675.47 --> 1682.34
yeah I'm the controller yeah but you see

1677.15 --> 1684.65
this politics right but at the same time

1682.34 --> 1688.6399999999999
there is a resurgence from the

1684.65 --> 1691.8700000000001
individuals yeah and that's fascinating

1688.64 --> 1697.9
and that is the evolution of

1691.87 --> 1697.8999999999999
Christianity okay sorry opinion

1700.09 --> 1707.54
right anyway Alan [ __ ] kind of

1704.11 --> 1714.07
religious and but he knew it's been done

1707.54 --> 1717.55
yeah yeah we don't know how the other

1714.07 --> 1722.84
people watching are they views on

1717.55 --> 1723.2
Christianity and Hinduism and stuff all

1722.84 --> 1725.54
right

1723.2 --> 1728.57
well there if you're gonna go with the

1725.54 --> 1730.97
literal religious formatting let's just

1728.57 --> 1733.04
call it like that like Oh worship you

1730.97 --> 1735.92
have to believe this and you have to do

1733.04 --> 1737.84
that and of course it's gonna conflict

1735.92 --> 1740.45
with other religions that just have an

1737.84 --> 1742.6699999999998
entirely different angle to it but if

1740.45 --> 1744.65
you try to approach it like I try to

1742.67 --> 1747.23
approach things and just see at the

1744.65 --> 1751.64
frequency and the function and the

1747.23 --> 1754.79
energies then suddenly you're not bound

1751.64 --> 1758.24
by some kind of code or spell you could

1754.79 --> 1759.62
say as part of their religion to declare

1758.24 --> 1763.01
hostilities or

1759.62 --> 1765.3799999999999
try to correct something yeah I

1763.01 --> 1768.8
understand that's that's why I said I'm

1765.38 --> 1770.42
not a descent mainstream Christian to me

1768.8 --> 1773.53
at the end of the day it's between you

1770.42 --> 1776.72
and God exactly means your relationship

1773.53 --> 1778.28
exactly no one no one else is gonna die

1776.72 --> 1781.69
with you you're dying with yourself and

1778.28 --> 1784.85
you it's your relationship with God sir

1781.69 --> 1786.77
if someone says you have to first do

1784.85 --> 1788.9599999999998
this and that then let's look go do it

1786.77 --> 1790.79
if you want but to me out what I learn

1788.96 --> 1795.38
is what I learned with my relationship

1790.79 --> 1797.6499999999999
with God well-said totally agree cheers

1795.38 --> 1797.65
to that

1799.83 --> 1809.4399999999998
yeah and then yeah if you approach

1805.539 --> 1814.75
things like that then you can have even

1809.44 --> 1817.5700000000002
a a multi-religious roots the act

1814.75 --> 1820.51
cooperation it's like okay we have

1817.57 --> 1823.84
different backgrounds in our beliefs but

1820.51 --> 1826.919
we follow the same frequency and at that

1823.84 --> 1829.86
we find yeah

1826.919 --> 1832.8400000000001
companionship or cooperation and then

1829.86 --> 1837.3999999999999
people from different kind of religions

1832.84 --> 1839.7099999999998
that are really like almost rebelling

1837.4 --> 1842.0700000000002
against their core religion and the

1839.71 --> 1844.809
power structure within that at it and

1842.07 --> 1850.6
just following the right frequency and

1844.809 --> 1851.799
all these people could meet and but yeah

1850.6 --> 1855.28
I don't know

1851.799 --> 1858.8799999999999
change change the the spiritual

1855.28 --> 1862.3899999999999
landscape just through different by gaff

1858.88 --> 1865.0900000000001
resonating that frequency by saying the

1862.39 --> 1867.3090000000002
right things at the right time and no

1865.09 --> 1870.52
longer being distracted by the ego and

1867.309 --> 1872.289
by the the orders from the church or

1870.52 --> 1873.61
they really have the religious masters

1872.289 --> 1876.309
and what they're supposed to do with

1873.61 --> 1879.1899999999998
just following the right frequency and

1876.309 --> 1881.98
resonating that could have a giant

1879.19 --> 1883.75
impact and in a way it's what I have

1881.98 --> 1885.8700000000001
over also been trying to achieve because

1883.75 --> 1888.37
there are so many problems with

1885.87 --> 1892.03
religious getting involved in politics

1888.37 --> 1895.7199999999998
and just power groups abusing certain

1892.03 --> 1898.48
factions and then it becomes a mess and

1895.72 --> 1901.72
everybody's basically put into attack

1898.48 --> 1902.919
mode against other groups that's what

1901.72 --> 1907.9
they're trying to manipulate all the

1902.919 --> 1912.01
time and I'm just thinking wait just

1907.9 --> 1912.909
isolate there are groups I just have to

1912.01 --> 1916.98
go for five minutes

1912.909 --> 1916.98
I'm sorry that's no problem

1919.879 --> 1932.009
all right I'll call you back all right

1926.549 --> 1940.049
but isolate the darkness cure it somehow

1932.009 --> 1942.6
and then repair their religion to remain

1940.049 --> 1946.98
it retain its purity and to take away

1942.6 --> 1949.559
the abuse abilities of the dark ones if

1946.98 --> 1952.23
that is possible or kind of inoculate

1949.559 --> 1954.629
them with a clear-cut knowledge of how

1952.23 --> 1957.629
it would typically be abused by

1954.629 --> 1960.119
controllers after it's returned to a

1957.629 --> 1963.36
true peaceful state their religion and

1960.119 --> 1966.1789999999999
that counts for almost every religion

1963.36 --> 1970.2299999999998
and I think that religions around the

1966.179 --> 1974.97
world have their position they are on in

1970.23 --> 1978.95
like how how aggressive they could

1974.97 --> 1981.24
become or how Civ yeah how civilized and

1978.95 --> 1985.019
peaceful and communicative and

1981.24 --> 1991.259
developing they can become my sound is a

1985.019 --> 1994.86
bit low right yeah I see thank you

1991.259 --> 2000.44
is this better right this is how it

1994.86 --> 2002.269
should be it was utter changed but if

2000.44 --> 2005.3300000000002
you just look out in the world right now

2002.269 --> 2011.269
you can basically size up where

2005.33 --> 2018.1689999999999
religions are at how much they are being

2011.269 --> 2021.86
controlled or being corrupted from the

2018.169 --> 2024.44
inside out or used as a war propaganda

2021.86 --> 2027.1689999999999
machine oh there's all kinds of things

2024.44 --> 2030.0800000000002
that religions around the world are

2027.169 --> 2033.7990000000002
being subjected to and it's like the

2030.08 --> 2037.61
state the religion is in right now but

2033.799 --> 2043.999
almost every religion as a as a sensible

2037.61 --> 2044.99
logos based core at the start of it most

2043.999 --> 2049.25
of it has

2044.99 --> 2052.909
and to me that is the that is the

2049.25 --> 2055.52
material the logos spring up well the

2052.909 --> 2058.01
the the real connection with God that

2055.52 --> 2060.379
spawns forth that glory and the true

2058.01 --> 2064.0400000000004
wisdom that is what we should all be

2060.379 --> 2066.71
preserving and trying to kind of get it

2064.04 --> 2070.0299999999997
all together through the path through

2066.71 --> 2073.399
the frequency not some kind of orders or

2070.03 --> 2077.57
commands within the religious structure

2073.399 --> 2082.0699999999997
of it that's what I feel about it anyway

2077.57 --> 2083.69
thank you Judy open for the $10 $10

2082.07 --> 2085.909
super chair donation good morning or

2083.69 --> 2088.78
when God is real so is Flat Earth indeed

2085.909 --> 2088.78
thank you

2107.28 --> 2116.28
well that happy that's that's just the

2110.46 --> 2118.88
issue there is no right one there's just

2116.28 --> 2124.6800000000003
the right path

2118.88 --> 2129.78
and each individual has to find where

2124.68 --> 2133.31
they can attain the best possible path

2129.78 --> 2136.65
for them and that can be through a

2133.31 --> 2142.11
singular religion out there or it can be

2136.65 --> 2147.98
through their own figuring it out all

2142.11 --> 2147.98
right more color logos this refers to

2148.4 --> 2157.44
it's basically the Word of God it is the

2152.51 --> 2160.26
will of God within creation so it is

2157.44 --> 2163.23
also the natural reflection of what is

2160.26 --> 2165.57
good and what is evil within all things

2163.23 --> 2168.36
it's the response it's the result of

2165.57 --> 2172.02
karma you could call it it is the

2168.36 --> 2178.38
entropy of the spirit or the entropy

2172.02 --> 2182.12
effect of God it is how creation and the

2178.38 --> 2186.69
will of God manifests through creation

2182.12 --> 2190.68
logos and if you step away from the from

2186.69 --> 2194.04
naturalness from logos then that will

2190.68 --> 2196.6499999999996
reflect back upon you you will end your

2194.04 --> 2198.72
punishment and you could say oh you're

2196.65 --> 2201.77
enduring it from God but you're actually

2198.72 --> 2204.6899999999996
enduring it from creation from being

2201.77 --> 2210.48
natural from doing something that you

2204.69 --> 2215.91
were not optimally designed to do or you

2210.48 --> 2221.22
didn't use it for the right reasons you

2215.91 --> 2223.5299999999997
were misled for example and that is non

2221.22 --> 2227.97
logos and then it is up to the

2223.53 --> 2230.7200000000003
individual to atone to see that to take

2227.97 --> 2234.3599999999997
it and then to learn and to overcome

2230.72 --> 2237.8399999999997
what caused it hopefully and that is how

2234.36 --> 2239.52
you get back on the path and that is

2237.84 --> 2241.88
what I've been trying to do for a long

2239.52 --> 2241.88
time

2243.14 --> 2248.73
and I think I'm doing good enough even

2246.63 --> 2252.6
by my own standards so I could probably

2248.73 --> 2254.33
say I'm doing really good but my ego how

2252.6 --> 2259.38
it works right now doesn't allow me to

2254.33 --> 2265.65
truly believe that so but it's just good

2259.38 --> 2269.57
enough for now there's still so much I

2265.65 --> 2277.94
have to do before I can say that I've

2269.57 --> 2277.94
that's really yeah that I'm there anyway

2282.38 --> 2288.7000000000003
and let's see a flat side ah I think

2285.62 --> 2288.7
that's it back

2292.61 --> 2305.51
alright okay ease back hello three love

2305.18 --> 2314.24
it

2305.51 --> 2317.78
yeah no problem you know you're alright

2314.24 --> 2323.27
so what'd I miss

2317.78 --> 2324.8300000000004
oh yeah I was just continuing the train

2323.27 --> 2326.39
of thought about the religions and then

2324.83 --> 2328.4
referred it back to the path somebody

2326.39 --> 2332.27
asked about what is the correct religion

2328.4 --> 2335.03
Jesus it's a hilariously typical

2332.27 --> 2336.98
question so I explained it there is no

2335.03 --> 2341.9
right religion there's only the path and

2336.98 --> 2345.35
whatever you need from any religion or

2341.9 --> 2347.81
to get that you yeah you'll find it and

2345.35 --> 2350.96
that can for some people be sticking to

2347.81 --> 2353.12
one religion and being in that and to

2350.96 --> 2354.56
others it will be little bits from

2353.12 --> 2356.5099999999998
everything and try to make their own

2354.56 --> 2360.62
thing and they'll figure it out if it's

2356.51 --> 2368.75
right as they go yeah every every person

2360.62 --> 2374.99
is gonna have their own right now as if

2368.75 --> 2378.68
check out not all religions are wrong it

2374.99 --> 2384.3799999999997
is what men do men and women do with it

2378.68 --> 2386.5099999999998
that can be wrong I would say it takes

2384.38 --> 2389.8
more faith to believe in nothing and

2386.51 --> 2389.8
actually believe in something

2392.94 --> 2402.87
faith hmm I don't know maybe more

2398.91 --> 2404.8199999999997
discipline because it's really tough to

2402.87 --> 2407.88
believe in nothing because you want to

2404.82 --> 2409.5
occupy your mind with something and in

2407.88 --> 2411.1800000000003
order to do that there are things you

2409.5 --> 2414.33
need to believe in or you can't occupy

2411.18 --> 2420.2999999999997
your mind with it so I think it's more

2414.33 --> 2424.77
about discipline than about belief right

2420.3 --> 2427.23
I find it really tough well not so not

2424.77 --> 2432.24
so much anymore at first I thought it

2427.23 --> 2434.31
was really tough to really accept like

2432.24 --> 2439.31
yeah there are things we really don't

2434.31 --> 2442.92
know and at first I kind of used it as a

2439.31 --> 2446.61
weapon to create maneuvering room within

2442.92 --> 2449.76
the scene to kind of dispel the whole

2446.61 --> 2451.59
flat earth disk model presupposition

2449.76 --> 2455.19
what's going on it's been going on for a

2451.59 --> 2458.58
long time so I used that and now I'm

2455.19 --> 2462.21
there it's like okay I've been that's

2458.58 --> 2463.94
been my my angle to it and it is

2462.21 --> 2467.31
acceptable

2463.94 --> 2470.78
so I basically accept yeah there is just

2467.31 --> 2473.16
very little that we know but that

2470.78 --> 2475.8
doesn't mean that we can never find out

2473.16 --> 2480.24
when people say that I say that's based

2475.8 --> 2483.0600000000004
on what information would you conclude

2480.24 --> 2485.9399999999996
that we can never find that yeah I mean

2483.06 --> 2490.02
you never know everything it should give

2485.94 --> 2493.31
you information as long rights there's

2490.02 --> 2493.31
no way that anybody can claim

2498.51 --> 2505.2700000000004
but it is kind of tough because people

2503.109 --> 2506.77
have been conditioned from a very young

2505.27 --> 2511.33
age through the television through

2506.77 --> 2515.08
school through everything that humanity

2511.33 --> 2517.119
supposedly has all the knowledge and we

2515.08 --> 2523.2999999999997
are freaking smart and we are like at

2517.119 --> 2526.0
the peak of humanity as it were and then

2523.3 --> 2529.6600000000003
at the same time parallel to that there

2526.0 --> 2532.119
is like this weird intellectuals that

2529.66 --> 2534.0699999999997
get really arrogant about things and

2532.119 --> 2536.2000000000003
then at the same time say but yeah

2534.07 --> 2538.48
actually it's it's the worst it's ever

2536.2 --> 2541.48
been and we don't even understand how we

2538.48 --> 2546.369
could attain all this incredible stuff

2541.48 --> 2547.81
when people degenerate so much because

2546.369 --> 2551.53
that's going well at the same time

2547.81 --> 2553.81
that's going parallel yeah I would say

2551.53 --> 2558.13
it's like the know beautiful talk of

2553.81 --> 2559.599
them of the modern world see ya

2558.13 --> 2564.55
technology is sort of dumbed down

2559.599 --> 2567.369
everybody served to reliance right but

2564.55 --> 2570.4900000000002
at the same time from this mindset of

2567.369 --> 2573.0
the nobody atheist nobility of the

2570.49 --> 2579.49
Western world you could call it maybe

2573.0 --> 2580.42
they don't understand truly where it's

2579.49 --> 2582.58
coming from

2580.42 --> 2585.2200000000003
they just reason out okay because people

2582.58 --> 2587.95
are given stuff to replace their skill

2585.22 --> 2589.75
that takes away their skill but that's

2587.95 --> 2592.75
the only thing they're really looking at

2589.75 --> 2595.06
because they don't entertain spiritual

2592.75 --> 2597.19
development really they they completely

2595.06 --> 2599.109
separate that every time in the subject

2597.19 --> 2601.15
that's like one corner there's the

2599.109 --> 2603.04
spirit talk and potentially medium

2601.15 --> 2605.589
saying you can go anywhere fantasy and

2603.04 --> 2608.56
on the other side the real world and

2605.589 --> 2612.63
real world data and analysis and

2608.56 --> 2613.93
statistics and the hard edge and

2612.63 --> 2618.849
profiteering

2613.93 --> 2622.33
all that and they separated that and if

2618.849 --> 2625.51
they hadn't then I don't think the world

2622.33 --> 2628.44
would be in this state because the

2625.51 --> 2631.2990000000004
separation is what really allowed

2628.44 --> 2634.149
commercialism and exploitation

2631.299 --> 2636.369
to manipulate people and break them away

2634.149 --> 2640.509
from God and from the spirit through all

2636.369 --> 2642.1890000000003
the all the all the materials and all

2640.509 --> 2645.459
the indoctrinations and the religions

2642.189 --> 2648.699
and of the of the globe and the the

2645.459 --> 2652.089
modern thinking that yeah to move people

2648.699 --> 2656.619
away from God make yeah grayton their

2652.089 --> 2659.859
hunger like awaken their hunger for four

2656.619 --> 2664.179
base things for wealth and for scoring

2659.859 --> 2667.919
and for being great and then feeding of

2664.179 --> 2671.799
that making them into basically hungry

2667.919 --> 2677.229
seduced pigs so they could sell them pig

2671.799 --> 2679.659
food that's what it's become the vision

2677.229 --> 2684.999
has changed totally I mean that's like

2679.659 --> 2688.179
distracting someone and just going I'm

2684.999 --> 2692.589
hungry you it's kind of even in a way

2688.179 --> 2695.109
it's kind of like a drug dealer give

2692.589 --> 2696.0389999999998
people a drug and they will gain hunger

2695.109 --> 2700.5589999999997
for the drug

2696.039 --> 2704.4990000000003
it's very mechanical very physical but

2700.559 --> 2708.1890000000003
that effect is basically going on even

2704.499 --> 2711.3289999999997
with behavior and culture but it's

2708.189 --> 2715.5989999999997
purely cultural and spiritual it's just

2711.329 --> 2719.8590000000004
you can't point at it because it steers

2715.599 --> 2721.929
how people make decisions and that's

2719.859 --> 2723.819
much harder to point that to grasp

2721.929 --> 2730.529
without getting some kind of political

2723.819 --> 2733.599
conflict going you see are you with me

2730.529 --> 2739.569
still yeah this y'all the water sorry

2733.599 --> 2742.869
I'm listening but it is the same effect

2739.569 --> 2745.119
you create the appetizers they say The

2742.869 --> 2747.909
Hunger the how some kind of seduced

2745.119 --> 2752.739
hunger for something that is actually

2747.909 --> 2756.609
away from God it could be the love of

2752.739 --> 2759.189
money for example or yeah just being a

2756.609 --> 2762.7889999999998
peacock wanting to be the social number

2759.189 --> 2764.08
one wanting to be worshipped all these

2762.789 --> 2767.5600000000004
kind of elements

2764.08 --> 2770.41
and they feed people this they give this

2767.56 --> 2772.56
as an example as an idol and when people

2770.41 --> 2775.48
especially young people get to see that

2772.56 --> 2777.16
then they copy it as behavior just as

2775.48 --> 2778.66
they would with their parents if they

2777.16 --> 2780.73
had spent all that time with their

2778.66 --> 2788.5899999999997
parents instead of with social media and

2780.73 --> 2792.31
TV see how that works it's really up to

2788.59 --> 2794.86
the parents to recognize this and then

2792.31 --> 2800.29
take it away and they're really smart

2794.86 --> 2802.51
people very intelligent counter beasts

2800.29 --> 2804.58
logos people that know this and they

2802.51 --> 2808.84
don't allow their children to watch TV

2804.58 --> 2811.99
or have mobile phones and that's for a

2808.84 --> 2815.11
very good reason because in that time

2811.99 --> 2818.35
period there are gonna build their

2815.11 --> 2819.82
character their who they are based on

2818.35 --> 2823.12
what they observe or what they get

2819.82 --> 2826.0
confronted with what makes sense to them

2823.12 --> 2827.74
eventually so if you then yeah allow a

2826.0 --> 2830.2
monster in that has all kind of

2827.74 --> 2832.0899999999997
indecency and seductions and because

2830.2 --> 2835.0899999999997
disgusting stuff that's just out of

2832.09 --> 2837.3700000000003
proportion and you expose your kids to

2835.09 --> 2841.81
that especially if they're sensitive and

2837.37 --> 2845.44
they're not guided through it like by

2841.81 --> 2847.0299999999997
like look this is bad behavior like the

2845.44 --> 2850.0
parents should be sitting next to that

2847.03 --> 2852.4300000000003
just like this is bad that's okay this

2850.0 --> 2854.29
is that and explain why but parents

2852.43 --> 2857.9199999999996
don't do that and because they don't

2854.29 --> 2861.55
their children become deranged and

2857.92 --> 2865.9
programmed by the modern-day delusions

2861.55 --> 2869.11
and they're not here in the first place

2865.9 --> 2871.96
with yeah these crazy social justice

2869.11 --> 2876.31
warrior movement and all these slobs and

2871.96 --> 2878.71
trolls that's what came from that yeah

2876.31 --> 2881.14
and that's why I would say general the

2878.71 --> 2884.44
true generation to turn a generation it

2881.14 --> 2887.14
gets worse people are just not having

2884.44 --> 2892.0
concept or any more straight to have a

2887.14 --> 2895.42
role model right if if parents are not

2892.0 --> 2897.819
corrected it while they grow older and

2895.42 --> 2900.369
if they keep on doing as they

2897.819 --> 2902.92
you then their children will try to

2900.369 --> 2905.38
outdo them that's what children all they

2902.92 --> 2907.839
always do they try to attain alpha state

2905.38 --> 2909.849
as it were that's what children do

2907.839 --> 2911.5589999999997
that's natural it's really annoying by

2909.849 --> 2913.3900000000003
the way no matter who you are but that's

2911.559 --> 2915.1600000000003
how it works and if you're still I'm

2913.39 --> 2917.44
kind of a dark road without even

2915.16 --> 2921.3999999999996
realizing it then the children will

2917.44 --> 2923.259
outdo you become worse because you the

2921.4 --> 2924.63
parents have not been corrected and so

2923.259 --> 2929.049
the children just take the example

2924.63 --> 2932.4100000000003
unabated see and that's how it gets

2929.049 --> 2935.17
worse over the generations but at the

2932.41 --> 2938.739
same time either one of these parents

2935.17 --> 2940.539
could really be awake and be slapped in

2938.739 --> 2944.739
the face by cohn some kind of social

2940.539 --> 2947.7090000000003
situation or get some real angry family

2944.739 --> 2949.65
issue over what have you done and you

2947.709 --> 2952.719
should know better

2949.65 --> 2955.9300000000003
why have you abandoned Christ so badly

2952.719 --> 2958.089
for example you know because first at

2955.93 --> 2960.339
first you know we have family situations

2958.089 --> 2962.739
and for example let's just say roughly

2960.339 --> 2965.049
Catholics because you could really take

2962.739 --> 2966.699
that general and some in the family will

2965.049 --> 2968.579
be like yeah Christ it's really

2966.699 --> 2971.44
important to go to church every time

2968.579 --> 2974.619
just do it right and others behave you

2971.44 --> 2976.599
be like yeah yeah I'll go along and then

2974.619 --> 2978.579
there may be like the rebellious kid

2976.599 --> 2982.329
they're like yeah I really don't like it

2978.579 --> 2984.19
because of good reasons bad things

2982.329 --> 2986.319
happen in the church and they just stare

2984.19 --> 2988.42
at it and they like I don't like it and

2986.319 --> 2991.5389999999998
then that's except that usually by the

2988.42 --> 2994.869
family roughly accepted but that could

2991.539 --> 2996.279
get also worse they could start to hang

2994.869 --> 2998.829
around with other people that kind of

2996.279 --> 3002.94
think alike but that have much darker

2998.829 --> 3005.309
roots and they could be drawn away and

3002.94 --> 3009.869
that's kind of what happened to me in my

3005.309 --> 3012.509
own way well they didn't understand that

3009.869 --> 3015.449
my rebellion could lead to worse things

3012.509 --> 3017.489
as it were because they didn't see it

3015.449 --> 3021.2090000000003
because rebellion was kind of like

3017.489 --> 3024.299
standard the liberal thing to do in how

3021.209 --> 3028.41
they saw things and and I thought it too

3024.299 --> 3031.92
and anyway this is come way over the

3028.41 --> 3034.109
side but don't you say yeah I think

3031.92 --> 3037.91
these things happen to families and to

3034.109 --> 3040.92
people you don't see it coming first

3037.91 --> 3048.3289999999997
yeah it happens small before you know it

3040.92 --> 3051.199
you're in in the hope right would you

3048.329 --> 3055.2290000000003
say would you say you have a close

3051.199 --> 3061.319
family bond with your parents well my

3055.229 --> 3063.509
mother's dead for for some time I Wow my

3061.319 --> 3066.5389999999998
mother was very special to me but I

3063.509 --> 3069.479
would end it was terrible because she

3066.539 --> 3072.0890000000004
will basically went mad no she was

3069.479 --> 3074.9399999999996
always kind of nutty but like really bad

3072.089 --> 3077.4
and started to see me like my dad after

3074.94 --> 3081.63
they had divorced and was basically a

3077.4 --> 3083.549
nightmare how it ended but that wasn't

3081.63 --> 3087.109
always like that when I was much younger

3083.549 --> 3090.239
my mother was extremely dedicated and

3087.109 --> 3093.859
really helped to develop my mind at a

3090.239 --> 3098.88
young age put a lot of effort into that

3093.859 --> 3101.119
and so did my brother by the way my half

3098.88 --> 3104.1600000000003
were other seven years older

3101.119 --> 3106.259
but yeah how it ended was bad but now I

3104.16 --> 3109.799
still have my dad and it's kind of funny

3106.259 --> 3112.739
I guess or I'm very lucky you could say

3109.799 --> 3115.859
because when I was younger my dad wasn't

3112.739 --> 3118.17
really all that great kind he took he

3115.859 --> 3120.359
took like physical responsibility for me

3118.17 --> 3121.9790000000003
when I was a little kid like he really

3120.359 --> 3124.199
was my guardian he took that seriously

3121.979 --> 3126.66
enough but as soon as I started to

3124.199 --> 3130.94
develop intellectually I think he kind

3126.66 --> 3134.279
of like was jealous because he had been

3130.94 --> 3137.2490000000003
stuck in certain emotional ways for a

3134.279 --> 3139.469
very long time it's complex and he kind

3137.249 --> 3142.9489999999996
of was a walker away type and that came

3139.469 --> 3144.809
back when I was a young teenager and

3142.949 --> 3147.119
what and I didn't like that I hated him

3144.809 --> 3149.009
for it and my mother was constantly it

3147.119 --> 3151.7690000000002
was everywhere he became the black sheep

3149.009 --> 3154.679
in the family because of that but still

3151.769 --> 3156.8089999999997
tagged along and yeah turned into a

3154.679 --> 3158.39
cocked situation like that it was it was

3156.809 --> 3160.94
terrible it was a bad in

3158.39 --> 3164.45
for me and I was kind of conditioned by

3160.94 --> 3168.23
my family to hate him really badly to be

3164.45 --> 3173.4199999999996
like a living hated dad all dads bad you

3168.23 --> 3177.079
know the 90 [ __ ] I that that went where

3173.42 --> 3179.63
I went right through that but in my I

3177.079 --> 3181.46
always hoped that he would someday kind

3179.63 --> 3184.13
of wake up from his own personal

3181.46 --> 3186.5
nightmare and become a real dad somehow

3184.13 --> 3191.75
and the weird thing is that after my

3186.5 --> 3195.039
mother died that happened and I suddenly

3191.75 --> 3199.19
got to know my dad as a person that was

3195.039 --> 3202.46
actually real and open and had his own

3199.19 --> 3204.529
wisdom and it clearly finally understood

3202.46 --> 3208.01
and recognized his own faults and

3204.529 --> 3212.21
problems and would just look ahead in

3208.01 --> 3214.6400000000003
how am I gonna deal with that and I for

3212.21 --> 3217.67
me that was a revolution I was so proud

3214.64 --> 3220.0099999999998
of my dad when I just felt that had

3217.67 --> 3222.109
happened he wasn't telling me I'm in

3220.01 --> 3225.259
doing I'm gonna do - no no he wasn't

3222.109 --> 3227.72
like that at all he just did it and I

3225.259 --> 3232.099
felt he did it and it was like oh my god

3227.72 --> 3234.74
I have my dad I have a dad there any

3232.099 --> 3236.9
years but I have a dad you know that's

3234.74 --> 3239.8089999999997
open that's that's something a lot of

3236.9 --> 3241.339
children miss out on that like you said

3239.809 --> 3245.329
you've missed out on it but the least

3241.339 --> 3247.509
you got a chance - we can make that like

3245.329 --> 3249.65
the stage a lot of people don't get that

3247.509 --> 3251.839
growing up without a father or a mother

3249.65 --> 3258.799
or something right they just go down the

3251.839 --> 3260.869
wrong path mm-hmm it's very tough for a

3258.799 --> 3265.069
lot of people if they are stuck in a bad

3260.869 --> 3268.369
railroad to actually overcome that later

3265.069 --> 3271.369
in life and not just punish themselves

3268.369 --> 3273.4700000000003
more and more for it as they grow older

3271.369 --> 3276.859
because a lot of people do that they

3273.47 --> 3283.069
don't find the courage to step out of

3276.859 --> 3285.74
their rails out of the bad path go

3283.069 --> 3287.66
through the resolving process which is

3285.74 --> 3290.269
used to be pretty impactful it's pretty

3287.66 --> 3291.7999999999997
heavy to actually recognize like

3290.269 --> 3295.5499999999997
lifelong mistake

3291.8 --> 3298.19
and then still have hope that they can

3295.55 --> 3302.02
somehow build something new at a later

3298.19 --> 3305.9
age but people do that and can do that

3302.02 --> 3308.87
it's like a second chance thing yeah and

3305.9 --> 3310.46
some people do succeed and like everyone

3308.87 --> 3312.62
knows that's a blessing

3310.46 --> 3314.9900000000002
that is such a blessing what people

3312.62 --> 3317.56
really snap out of it because usually

3314.99 --> 3320.45
people don't expect that to happen

3317.56 --> 3323.15
because most people don't most people

3320.45 --> 3324.5
stay stuck in there bad railroad as soon

3323.15 --> 3330.14
as they get caught the rest of their

3324.5 --> 3331.7
life unfortunately yeah that's something

3330.14 --> 3335.15
everybody has to work doing in life

3331.7 --> 3342.3199999999997
everybody has the counts right watch
