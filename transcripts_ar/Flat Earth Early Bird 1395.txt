either one of our countries is like a

248.819 --> 253.57999999999998
day behind the other that happens too

[Music]

I listen to music I think did I and I

283.199 --> 285.56
don't understand

285.84 --> 288.56
I think so

290.639 --> 294.919
right

292.979 --> 298.38
hmm

294.919 --> 300.53999999999996

298.38 --> 303.86
wow

300.54 --> 303.86
so that's just special

304.74 --> 308.06
this is modern art

312.96 --> 315.919
wouldn't you say

319.979 --> 327.02
I was delay but it was deliberate

324.3 --> 327.02000000000004
you know

346.5 --> 353.4
right

347.15 --> 355.52
[Music]

353.4 --> 355.52
um

355.979 --> 358.979
foreign

359.34 --> 362.48999999999995
[Music]

362.78 --> 366.02
Benjamin a little

367.44 --> 373.62
so this Mr Beast thing that he did two

370.08 --> 377.28
shows on and man he was not exaggerating

373.62 --> 379.44
that guy is [ __ ] up

377.28 --> 381.73999999999995
that's something really dark going on

379.44 --> 381.74
there

381.9 --> 386.88
and especially like in his second stream

384.36 --> 389.699
about it

386.88 --> 392.819
he is really really hitting like some

389.699 --> 395.699
Nails on the head right there

392.819 --> 398.52000000000004
so I haven't finished watching that but

395.699 --> 401.3
I will later today

398.52 --> 401.29999999999995
uh

403.74 --> 410.34000000000003
right I also well because of

407.52 --> 414.9
recommendation yesterday on the show I

410.34 --> 417.59999999999997
watched the uh the Charlie Chaplin movie

414.9 --> 421.02
and it's weird because I've seen it

417.6 --> 423.12
before and back then it was boring as

421.02 --> 425.639
[ __ ] to me

423.12 --> 429.919
I was just like can't we just watch the

425.639 --> 429.919
Charlie Chaplin movies instead of this

430.68 --> 436.819
because it was just like the hyper

433.28 --> 440.4
autobiography biographic

436.819 --> 442.199
and not super interesting it was like a

440.4 --> 443.58
person's studying

442.199 --> 445.979
I didn't know

443.58 --> 448.46
I guess you could say it was fair enough

445.979 --> 452.099
I don't even know

448.46 --> 454.31899999999996
it did give me like a more insight into

452.099 --> 456.96
well what Charlie Chaplin would have

454.319 --> 459.0
been like as a person though something

456.96 --> 460.979
that well I guess when there was a

459.0 --> 463.44
teenager did not interest me in the

460.979 --> 465.599
slightest I was just like no I just

463.44 --> 468.02
watched the movies silent movies are

465.599 --> 468.02
hilarious

469.02 --> 474.419
but uh yeah it was interesting but also

472.62 --> 476.819
I remember watching it before and then

474.419 --> 478.919
completely being disinterested

476.819 --> 480.599
I don't think I even finished watching

478.919 --> 483.96
that movie

480.599 --> 486.9
I was like why are we talking with a

483.96 --> 489.599
supposed old Charlie Chaplin

486.9 --> 492.17999999999995
that's just

489.599 --> 494.419
like it's not actually even him so it's

492.18 --> 494.419
like

498.0 --> 500.0
um

500.58 --> 506.419
but I did watch that and yeah that was

503.099 --> 506.419
interesting uh

512.58 --> 517.0200000000001
I'm gonna have to do that I keep giving

515.219 --> 518.3900000000001
you the link and keep telling you but

517.02 --> 521.47
you don't

518.39 --> 521.47
[Music]

522.36 --> 525.2
Cruise Shank

540.779 --> 543.92
The Great Dictator

544.2 --> 547.4590000000001
yeah good movie

547.56 --> 551.7199999999999
very important apparently to him

554.22 --> 558.3000000000001
and it's like the first movie where he

556.08 --> 560.519
actually starts speaking and I think

558.3 --> 562.4399999999999
also the last one he made

560.519 --> 563.64
but yeah

562.44 --> 568.399
I mean

563.64 --> 568.399
his actual works are really interesting

569.279 --> 575.279
it's like an it's its own art form

572.459 --> 577.56
and he's really good at it that was his

575.279 --> 580.62
thing Charlie Chaplin's thing

577.56 --> 582.4799999999999
and maybe like The Three Stooges right

580.62 --> 584.86
they were another

582.48 --> 590.74
of course very famous

584.86 --> 590.74
[Music]

609.06 --> 611.2399999999999
foreign

633.18 --> 637.56
right but yeah it was it was well worth

636.06 --> 639.0
watching

637.56 --> 642.18
and

639.0 --> 643.62
it's just funny that when I started I

642.18 --> 646.8599999999999
was like I don't think I've seen this

643.62 --> 649.38
before and then eventually like a way

646.86 --> 653.1
I have seen this before and I thought it

649.38 --> 655.98
was boring back then but now I can

653.1 --> 658.74
appreciate just all the subtleties and

655.98 --> 660.72
more intricate more adult character

658.74 --> 662.94
traits and all that

660.72 --> 665.279
back then it was just like uh what is

662.94 --> 668.48
this about this guy in this freaking

665.279 --> 668.48
romances all the time

668.76 --> 673.98
like just show me the chaplain movies

670.92 --> 675.5999999999999

673.98 --> 677.399

675.6 --> 680.76
everybody in my family was

677.399 --> 683.22
and Lauren Hardy and all that

680.76 --> 686.36
they used to play that all the time on

683.22 --> 686.36

if you're in a shitty place where

939.54 --> 947.459
[ __ ] drunk people wallow around and

988.32 --> 994.4300000000001
marks Brothers oh okay right not the

same marks I guess

994.43 --> 997.4799999999999
[Music]

1006.279 --> 1010.72
hmm okay tominoid thanks

1014.779 --> 1022.399
it's weird because like the the Marx

1017.899 --> 1022.399
word was even popularized

1024.799 --> 1029.66
I think that at the time where he was

1027.319 --> 1031.3999999999999
basically doing his thing people mostly

1029.66 --> 1035.179
just thought of him as like an

1031.4 --> 1037.7800000000002
anti-establishment revolutionary

1035.179 --> 1037.7800000000002
foreign

1038.54 --> 1044.12
like I even remember having been read a

1041.059 --> 1046.8799999999999
book by some writer who called himself

1044.12 --> 1050.4799999999998
Karl Marx which is in retrospect like

1046.88 --> 1052.64
really super slain it was just about

1050.48 --> 1054.5
like some

1052.64 --> 1057.22
Cowboy stories

1054.5 --> 1057.22
or something

1059.9 --> 1062.0800000000002
like

1062.179 --> 1067.5800000000002
like a sort of a Lone Ranger setup but

1064.88 --> 1069.2
his own it's like a shatter hand and win

1067.58 --> 1070.9399999999998
it too I don't know some of you might

1069.2 --> 1073.7
even I think there's even been a movie

1070.94 --> 1076.039
made of that but the writer of that

1073.7 --> 1079.64
supposedly called himself Karl Marx

1076.039 --> 1081.14
because it was all the radio

1079.64 --> 1083.48
yeah

1081.14 --> 1085.2800000000002
but yeah who could have foreseen of

1083.48 --> 1087.5
course that

1085.28 --> 1089.36
in the yeah in the 19th century who

1087.5 --> 1092.84
could have foreseen that Karl Marx would

1089.36 --> 1095.9189999999999
be like at the root of so much terrible

1092.84 --> 1095.9189999999999
terrible evil

1097.88 --> 1102.6200000000001
that yeah

1099.26 --> 1103.84
that this alternative to the old block

1102.62 --> 1107.36
War

1103.84 --> 1110.62
mentality generals and all that would be

1107.36 --> 1110.62
even worse

1111.32 --> 1118.6399999999999
like oh we're at peace but everybody's

1113.96 --> 1121.58
depressed deranged and evil yay

1118.64 --> 1125.0590000000002
what a great solution that was hey Carl

1121.58 --> 1127.76
great solution huh

1125.059 --> 1130.82
I mean yeah if nobody can know if

1127.76 --> 1133.52
everybody's disabled to maintain and

1130.82 --> 1135.4399999999998
find their own pride and identity yeah

1133.52 --> 1137.12
that nobody's gonna get to the point

1135.44 --> 1139.28
where they're gonna go at war with

1137.12 --> 1141.799
another

1139.28 --> 1146.12
because everybody's just too preoccupied

1141.799 --> 1149.86
with their own [ __ ] yeah great system oh

1146.12 --> 1149.86
thank you so much for that

1150.679 --> 1152.799
okay

1155.98 --> 1164.57
anyway hello sleep with one eye open

1159.61 --> 1164.57
[Music]

1165.2 --> 1170.8400000000001
and which one wrote the manifesto is

1167.84 --> 1170.84
right

1182.179 --> 1189.2
well it seems blatantly obvious also in

1185.36 --> 1191.12
context of that time period tominoid

1189.2 --> 1194.059
and I learned this through the Charlie

1191.12 --> 1196.2199999999998
Chaplin movie with the very quick run

1194.059 --> 1199.039
through of what was going on

1196.22 --> 1201.34
well these supposed Mark brought Mark's

1199.039 --> 1201.34
Brothers

1201.799 --> 1207.74
American family comedy Act

1204.98 --> 1209.6
I'll bet that they were also then taken

1207.74 --> 1212.96
down during the whole communist

1209.6 --> 1216.34
Crackdown [ __ ] which was brought up in

1212.96 --> 1216.3400000000001
the Charlie Chaplin movie too

1219.02 --> 1223.76
I mean if you literally call yourself

1221.24 --> 1227.78
that then

1223.76 --> 1229.28
you're gonna get targeted for sure

1227.78 --> 1231.9189999999999
so

1229.28 --> 1234.9189999999999
and all yeah and around that same time

1231.919 --> 1239.14
period where you say they stopped

1234.919 --> 1239.14
that makes perfect sense actually

1240.679 --> 1247.94
anyway

[Music]

1288.58 --> 1291.9399999999998
but anyway

1291.98 --> 1296.17
that's what I watched

1293.9 --> 1303.2
kept me busy

1296.17 --> 1303.2
[Music]

1308.99 --> 1314.93
[Music]

1315.74 --> 1320.6
right also

1317.72 --> 1324.44
I've been listening more Gustav Holst

1320.6 --> 1328.039
a lot of it I've never heard before ever

1324.44 --> 1329.48
and I can also see now like how he isn't

1328.039 --> 1332.9
always perfect

1329.48 --> 1337.34
but I definitely has a very persistent

1332.9 --> 1339.919
system I mean Gustav has a system

1337.34 --> 1342.3999999999999
and it's fascinating to see him at work

1339.919 --> 1342.4
with that

1345.919 --> 1351.0200000000002
but yeah all of it is a bit much to take

1348.62 --> 1354.1
in and that's in general for classical

1351.02 --> 1354.1
music I'd say

1355.52 --> 1360.9189999999999
and I still remember that from way back

1358.82 --> 1363.74
where I was like Wow classical music

1360.919 --> 1365.96
it's amazing then I'd listen to it for

1363.74 --> 1368.419
like an hour straight and then I'd be

1365.96 --> 1370.28
like okay I'm done now I don't want to

1368.419 --> 1373.159
listen to any more classical music for

1370.28 --> 1376.3999999999999
like at least half a year

1373.159 --> 1379.709
because it would just be saturated by it

1376.4 --> 1379.709
[Music]

1380.659 --> 1384.919
right now I'm not as easily easily

1383.059 --> 1386.96
saturated now

1384.919 --> 1388.7
but I'm already feeling like yeah I

1386.96 --> 1390.88
think I already got out of it what I

1388.7 --> 1390.88
wanted

1392.48 --> 1398.659
also realizing that yeah Gustav Holst is

1395.84 --> 1402.4399999999998
just basically one composer

1398.659 --> 1405.679
and there's like a hundred one out there

1402.44 --> 1408.1000000000001
and I should also kind of freshen up on

1405.679 --> 1408.1000000000001
Mahler

1409.64 --> 1414.3200000000002
and somebody said yesterday when I said

1412.34 --> 1417.35
like uh like

1414.32 --> 1419.059
Steven Spielberg and

1417.35 --> 1421.6999999999998
[Music]

1419.059 --> 1425.12
George Lucas took a lot from Gustav

1421.7 --> 1427.4
Mahler but or from Gustav Holst somebody

1425.12 --> 1428.9599999999998
said yeah but they were inspired on

1427.4 --> 1431.659
mother

1428.96 --> 1434.539
that that might be true I might have

1431.659 --> 1437.7800000000002
simply just been too

1434.539 --> 1439.46
focused on holes to really realize that

1437.78 --> 1442.22
like oh yeah there's other classical

1439.46 --> 1444.14
music with other traits

1442.22 --> 1447.2
and I think indeed like what is it the

1444.14 --> 1449.179
valkyrie or something it's called

1447.2 --> 1452.3600000000001
the Miler piece

1449.179 --> 1455.7800000000002
and that is very like there is a whole P

1452.36 --> 1458.9599999999998
the the host also sometimes resembles

1455.78 --> 1462.3999999999999
him a bit I think host probably

1458.96 --> 1462.4
like mile or two

1464.52 --> 1470.72
[Music]

1467.299 --> 1473.84
right also I'm noticing from well what I

1470.72 --> 1476.3600000000001
got what I downloaded so I can't really

1473.84 --> 1481.1789999999999
make any complaints that some of these

1476.36 --> 1481.1789999999999
recordings are not optimal at all

1485.36 --> 1491.0
like it's the same song but another

1488.659 --> 1494.9
recording and then I can just hear like

1491.0 --> 1497.72
wow they really did not get this effect

1494.9 --> 1501.7
done like the record sound the sound of

1497.72 --> 1501.7
the recording just didn't catch it

1502.82 --> 1507.26
like some magical moments were kind of

1504.919 --> 1509.919
lost because of the recording with some

1507.26 --> 1509.919
of these pieces

1510.08 --> 1516.26
so it must be very difficult to properly

1513.34 --> 1518.48
execute a concert like that

1516.26 --> 1520.8799999999999
and record it properly at the same time

1518.48 --> 1523.88
must be like a real challenge every time

1520.88 --> 1525.679
like did we finally do it did we get the

1523.88 --> 1528.679
perfect recording

1540.88 --> 1546.5200000000002

1546.52 --> 1551.32
was it that one I sorry

1551.84 --> 1558.4399999999998
I have not really studied classical

1554.659 --> 1560.5390000000002
music over my life just for the record

1558.44 --> 1563.0
it was always to me like oh yeah that's

1560.539 --> 1566.0
my mother's Department

1563.0 --> 1569.299
like she knew everything about that I

1566.0 --> 1572.98
don't I was much more interested in

1569.299 --> 1572.98
the more 20th century music

1573.74 --> 1578.9
like interested in actually digging into

1576.74 --> 1582.44
that I mean I totally respect classical

1578.9 --> 1585.44
music but it's never been like I

1582.44 --> 1588.559
am an exclusive a classical music guy no

1585.44 --> 1591.5800000000002
not at all again I I would like get sick

1588.559 --> 1591.58
of it after an hour

1603.62 --> 1607.539
hey Susie yes good to see you

presentation in school about Tchaikovsky

1647.059 --> 1654.1
but I was like

1648.86 --> 1654.1
nine I still remember doing that

1654.32 --> 1659.6
because I was really into it I did like

1657.86 --> 1661.3999999999999
Tchaikovsky a lot

1659.6 --> 1663.1999999999998
her father was a very fascinating

1661.4 --> 1665.419
character

1663.2 --> 1668.0800000000002
with a crazy

1665.419 --> 1668.0800000000002
story

1668.539 --> 1674.48
I mean Tchaikovsky is

1672.38 --> 1677.6000000000001
has like a little bit of his own

1674.48 --> 1680.32
Rasputin story and that sense it's all

1677.6 --> 1680.32
very Russian

1699.62 --> 1706.279
what I was doing with it like 30 years

1702.32 --> 1710.1399999999999

1785.12 --> 1789.1999999999998
literally just

1786.5 --> 1792.2
turning on another song Like Mine in a

1789.2 --> 1795.44
box or something just to get my mind out

1792.2 --> 1798.6200000000001
of the freaking Gustav Holst

1795.44 --> 1802.159
because there's this part

1798.62 --> 1805.1589999999999
in Hammersmith that just refuses to get

1802.159 --> 1808.64
out of my head it's the most simple and

1805.159 --> 1811.159
most beautiful thing basically where

1808.64 --> 1813.919
is it a clarinet is basically playing

1811.159 --> 1816.7990000000002
something very simple while the what is

1813.919 --> 1819.38
it the tenor or some bass

1816.799 --> 1821.44
string instrument is just

1819.38 --> 1824.8400000000001
um

1821.44 --> 1826.73
and it's so good

1824.84 --> 1828.26
like in a

1828.26 --> 1836.0

1836.0 --> 1843.559
because it is in a way weird and ominous

1840.08 --> 1847.279
but not like overtly so it's like a

1843.559 --> 1849.86
little ominous it's like a little bit

1847.279 --> 1852.38
uncomfortable because of what might

1849.86 --> 1855.1399999999999
happen there's like hidden potential in

1852.38 --> 1860.5590000000002
what's happening in that music

1855.14 --> 1860.5590000000002
ah anyway I'm just digging back into it

1861.38 --> 1868.0
but still yeah good stuff host has some

1864.98 --> 1870.679
of the most magical

1868.0 --> 1872.86
melodic Harmony that I've ever come

1870.679 --> 1875.539
across ever

1872.86 --> 1877.9399999999998
[Music]

1875.539 --> 1880.6589999999999
especially in the simple moments right

1877.94 --> 1884.1200000000001
not in the build up moments

1880.659 --> 1888.2
and that's all very impressive it's the

1884.12 --> 1893.559
silent moments where he's just like

1888.2 --> 1893.559
what is this what is happening now

1893.659 --> 1898.7700000000002
yes

1896.299 --> 1902.079
all right anyway

1898.77 --> 1902.079
[Music]

1914.419 --> 1919.64
yeah okay PGC but that makes perfect

1916.64 --> 1922.64
sense though you'd be surprised I mean

1919.64 --> 1925.159
if he was born deaf there's no way

1922.64 --> 1927.14
but he had the memory and he was a

1925.159 --> 1929.6000000000001
composer and musician so it doesn't

1927.14 --> 1934.22
matter if he can actually hear it you

1929.6 --> 1934.2199999999998
create the inner virtual world like

1934.399 --> 1940.9399999999998
technically with me that would

1938.0 --> 1944.12
please God don't send me on a path like

1940.94 --> 1946.159
that but like if I were to lose my

1944.12 --> 1948.5
eyesight for some reason

1946.159 --> 1951.5
I would still be able to perfectly

1948.5 --> 1955.399
describe visual things

1951.5 --> 1958.7
purely on memory purely on the practice

1955.399 --> 1962.299
of visualizing which would not go away

1958.7 --> 1965.059
you see you see unless I had correlating

1962.299 --> 1966.5
brain damage but then

1965.059 --> 1968.27
yeah

1966.5 --> 1971.6
nothing really matters then

1968.27 --> 1973.58
[Music]

1971.6 --> 1974.779
because yeah

1973.58 --> 1978.1999999999998
so

1974.779 --> 1981.14
it's only logical that if he just had

1978.2 --> 1984.02
his hearing and was a composer and was

1981.14 --> 1985.8200000000002
doing that he he just didn't need the

1984.02 --> 1989.5
sound anymore

1985.82 --> 1989.5
it would just do it all on memory

1991.52 --> 1996.44
yeah I can't feel the vibration but

1993.679 --> 1999.019
that's not really relevant though it's

1996.44 --> 2001.0
just like oh is there sound and you have

1999.019 --> 2003.1
to constantly then correlate it and

2001.0 --> 2004.84
basically fill out the vibration with

2003.1 --> 2007.899
your memory of how that's supposed to

2004.84 --> 2010.84
sound so he was probably figuring out a

2007.899 --> 2013.059
whole like how does it vibrate with

2010.84 --> 2014.74
which sound exactly does that correlate

2013.059 --> 2017.559
and he might have even already trained

2014.74 --> 2020.2
that before he even went deaf

2017.559 --> 2021.7
so yeah I can absolutely imagine how you

2020.2 --> 2024.46
would have done that it's still

2021.7 --> 2027.88
spectacular

2024.46 --> 2030.3990000000001
but it's not like oh I can't see how we

2027.88 --> 2034.2600000000002
could have ever done that no I can't I

2030.399 --> 2034.26
can't absolutely see how he's done that

2034.63 --> 2038.6190000000001
[Music]

2039.58 --> 2042.76
yeah when conducting that's going to be

2041.5 --> 2045.419
really

2042.76 --> 2045.419
difficult

2064.3 --> 2067.3

2068.399 --> 2073.419
he's just gonna hear it how it's how

2071.139 --> 2075.76
he's thinks it's supposed to be so yeah

2073.419 --> 2078.179
he won't pick up mistakes it's perfectly

2075.76 --> 2078.179
logical

2079.419 --> 2082.72
it would also be pretty difficult for

2081.7 --> 2086.08
him to

2082.72 --> 2088.5989999999997
even like reimagine completely an

2086.08 --> 2090.52
unfamiliar new types of music

2088.599 --> 2093.46
that would have been extremely difficult

2090.52 --> 2095.56
right if after he went deaf if then like

2093.46 --> 2097.42
some composer came out and like oh look

2095.56 --> 2100.24
at this completely new Revolution

2097.42 --> 2102.58
unheard of he would have probably been

2100.24 --> 2104.74
like [ __ ] that

2102.58 --> 2106.9
like I can't even actually listen to

2104.74 --> 2110.22
what that sounds like so how can I even

2106.9 --> 2112.96
like I can read what it's supposed to be

2110.22 --> 2115.06
but that doesn't mean that I would

2112.96 --> 2116.44
understand how it feels like see and

2115.06 --> 2118.25
that that would have been problematic

2116.44 --> 2121.44
for him

2132.099 --> 2137.619
just character back engineering

2135.579 --> 2140.98
all of it

2137.619 --> 2143.5
and and you can pretty decently figure

2140.98 --> 2145.18
out the things that are important to a

2143.5 --> 2147.339
person in their life even if you've

2145.18 --> 2148.66
never met them and they've died well

2147.339 --> 2152.02
before your birth

2148.66 --> 2154.06
just by putting together everything and

2152.02 --> 2156.88
then cross-referencing that to what

2154.06 --> 2159.64
you've learned of how humans work

2156.88 --> 2162.579
and then if you're just good at that in

2159.64 --> 2165.16
general it's not that difficult then

2162.579 --> 2168.1800000000003
figure out like how it would have been

2165.16 --> 2168.18

do the natural responses in the

2205.3 --> 2209.1400000000003
in letters and all that from that time I

2207.64 --> 2210.8199999999997
mean if somebody had a weird face

2209.14 --> 2213.8799999999997
they'll just say oh he gave this

2210.82 --> 2215.38
peculiar look and that's it right

2213.88 --> 2217.0
they're not going to be like oh yeah it

2215.38 --> 2219.6400000000003
was exactly like this and that and that

2217.0 --> 2221.079
no no no nobody caring it's just

2219.64 --> 2223.18
everybody just thought yeah of course

2221.079 --> 2225.51
you understand you gave that look I mean

2223.18 --> 2226.8999999999996
it's that look everybody gets that

2225.51 --> 2230.619
[Music]

2226.9 --> 2233.2000000000003
in that time period context right but

2230.619 --> 2235.9
now you'd have to completely just figure

2233.2 --> 2238.06
out who was that person actually how

2235.9 --> 2242.02
would they have been and then not try to

2238.06 --> 2244.96
[ __ ] dramatize it or modernize it for

2242.02 --> 2246.4
your political shitty influence agenda

2244.96 --> 2248.44
yeah

2246.4 --> 2250.78
if you actually want a character a

2248.44 --> 2253.7200000000003
historical character in a movie and you

2250.78 --> 2256.0600000000004
wanted it to be exactly how they would

2253.72 --> 2259.9199999999996
have been then you have to reverse

2256.06 --> 2259.92
engineer their entire psychology

2261.46 --> 2266.8
and not just by witness accounts and

2264.88 --> 2269.5
descriptions you'd have to actually

2266.8 --> 2272.5600000000004
figure out like

2269.5 --> 2275.82
who would he have been how would you

2272.56 --> 2275.82
live in that world

2275.859 --> 2280.119
beside what is historically described of

2279.04 --> 2282.72
them

2280.119 --> 2282.7200000000003
anyway

2291.7 --> 2296.68
Cube feels like

2294.64 --> 2299.14
if you put distinguish the side sphere

2296.68 --> 2303.0
of a cube what

2299.14 --> 2303.0
some reason gained Ironside

2303.52 --> 2309.7
okay Wonder Could you distinguish by

2306.76 --> 2311.079
side yeah you could but first you'd have

2309.7 --> 2314.74
to feel it

2311.079 --> 2318.04
yeah because then PG crew shank all your

2314.74 --> 2321.4599999999996
information is now based upon tactile

2318.04 --> 2322.96
yeah tactile tap touching so you know

2321.46 --> 2325.48
the shapes by touching and by the

2322.96 --> 2327.4
touching you then correlate the

2325.48 --> 2329.8
visualization in your mind of the shape

2327.4 --> 2333.2200000000003
right well if you then certainly get

2329.8 --> 2336.1600000000003
sight you do not have the connection

2333.22 --> 2340.54
so the first thing you would do is

2336.16 --> 2342.64
feel the shape to then realize oh

2340.54 --> 2345.4
that is the shape I've always been

2342.64 --> 2348.339
feeling visualizing and now I have a

2345.4 --> 2350.7400000000002
correlating site to actually match how

2348.339 --> 2353.97
it felt like and that's how you then

2350.74 --> 2358.5699999999997
would learn oops

[Music]

2364.07 --> 2367.1690000000003
[Music]

2377.74 --> 2383.3799999999997
I like that I like those types of

2380.8 --> 2385.9
curious questions

2383.38 --> 2388.42
it always gives me a great opportunity

2385.9 --> 2393.54
to basically lay down

2388.42 --> 2393.54
some more refined psychological insights

2395.92 --> 2400.42
what visualization looks like when

2398.32 --> 2402.28
you're blind isn't yeah but that's an

2400.42 --> 2404.92
oxymoron

2402.28 --> 2407.1400000000003
visualization doesn't actually look like

2404.92 --> 2410.38
anything

2407.14 --> 2412.2999999999997
it's visualization it's an image in your

2410.38 --> 2415.359
mind and

2412.3 --> 2418.7200000000003
well I call it an image because I've

2415.359 --> 2422.859
prioritized the actual visualizing

2418.72 --> 2426.5789999999997
as like the primary entry point

2422.859 --> 2428.2599999999998
so for me my visualization is very

2426.579 --> 2430.42
visual

2428.26 --> 2431.44
but it doesn't always have to be that

2430.42 --> 2433.54
way

2431.44 --> 2436.3
it's a construction in your mind of

2433.54 --> 2438.52
virtual information construction that

2436.3 --> 2444.3390000000004
connects

2438.52 --> 2448.42
systems together shapes forms

2444.339 --> 2450.5789999999997
and then correlates tactile

2448.42 --> 2453.1800000000003
visual

2450.579 --> 2453.1800000000003
foreign

2453.78 --> 2458.5
to that

2456.52 --> 2461.14
inner eye you could call it

2458.5 --> 2463.24
but it's not I call it visualization

2461.14 --> 2464.859
because that's how I typically do that

2463.24 --> 2467.859
with that mechanism but not everybody

2464.859 --> 2471.339
does that there's some people that don't

2467.859 --> 2475.54
really use visualization much

2471.339 --> 2478.18
in their inner mind and it's all sound

2475.54 --> 2481.119
they like recognize everything by sounds

2478.18 --> 2482.98
and things is really weird so it doesn't

2481.119 --> 2485.98
work the same with everybody

2482.98 --> 2487.96
I think the vast majority mostly focuses

2485.98 --> 2491.28
on visualization and that's kind of why

2487.96 --> 2491.28
they call it visualization

2492.47 --> 2495.66
[Music]

2504.7 --> 2507.48
you know what

2519.4 --> 2523.48
a good musician knows what music sounds

2521.74 --> 2526.66
like

2523.48 --> 2528.7
now that's you're I know what you mean

2526.66 --> 2532.66
but that's not actually correct they

2528.7 --> 2535.359
know what music sounds like

2532.66 --> 2537.7599999999998
oh wait no that's exactly what you did

2535.359 --> 2539.5
say yeah now but they understand the

2537.76 --> 2542.26
patterns

2539.5 --> 2543.579
they can just see roughly what it's

2542.26 --> 2547.1800000000003
going to be

2543.579 --> 2549.7000000000003
right I mean Melody is like a little

2547.18 --> 2551.68
dance and you it has a distinct pattern

2549.7 --> 2554.74
and if you're really good at that you

2551.68 --> 2557.44
can just see immediately like oh in the

2554.74 --> 2559.72
in just a big thing with all the room

2557.44 --> 2563.2000000000003
and then you can just see like oh wait

2559.72 --> 2565.06
that's that specific little tricky right

2563.2 --> 2566.68
so you just recognize like oh this

2565.06 --> 2569.32
pattern

2566.68 --> 2571.48
just by the shape of it you just start

2569.32 --> 2573.1600000000003
to recognize these little patterns of

2571.48 --> 2577.079
typical Melodies and all that and then

2573.16 --> 2577.0789999999997
you see the music eventually

2577.08 --> 2583.14
[Music]

2579.339 --> 2583.14
my mother was really good at that

2583.96 --> 2589.48
me not so much never been a star at

2586.48 --> 2593.7
reading music I mean I can do it

2589.48 --> 2596.859
it's just tiresome to me

2593.7 --> 2598.96
don't get super fluid at it

2596.859 --> 2601.839
I mean eventually what I may mostly do

2598.96 --> 2603.76
is like okay sheet of music

2601.839 --> 2605.98
I just learned the music

2603.76 --> 2608.6800000000003
and then eventually I literally don't

2605.98 --> 2610.54
need the sheet anymore I will be able to

2608.68 --> 2613.0
just like this sheet is just kind of a

2610.54 --> 2615.64
stepping stone to make sure how to get

2613.0 --> 2617.079
the music straight but then once I hear

2615.64 --> 2620.3799999999997
it enough

2617.079 --> 2623.46
I just don't need any sheets anymore I

2620.38 --> 2623.46
just do it

2624.64 --> 2629.859
because I have a good music memory you

2627.94 --> 2633.04
see

2629.859 --> 2636.4
music detail memory that's also part of

2633.04 --> 2638.92
why I'm really good at mimicking sound

2636.4 --> 2641.5
why I am like a parrot

2638.92 --> 2643.48
because I have a pretty good sound

2641.5 --> 2646.859

2643.48 --> 2646.859

mother

2664.9 --> 2670.839
oh wow

2667.359 --> 2674.859
you did Ariana that's interesting

2670.839 --> 2674.859
20 years whoa

2675.22 --> 2681.06
that's like my mother

2677.56 --> 2682.42
I mean my mother like officially studied

2681.06 --> 2685.44
[Music]

2682.42 --> 2685.44
classical piano

2702.52 --> 2706.0

2704.44 --> 2709.9
[Music]

2706.0 --> 2711.579

2709.9 --> 2713.26
that's why my mother wasn't a great

2711.579 --> 2715.54
asset because she was a really good

2713.26 --> 2717.579
music coach

2715.54 --> 2720.62
always helping people in studio

2717.579 --> 2728.7690000000002
recordings and [ __ ] always

2720.62 --> 2728.769
[Music]

2732.22 --> 2735.52

2734.56 --> 2737.74
that

2735.52 --> 2741.46
have you ever done concerts or anything

2737.74 --> 2743.0789999999997
I mean 20 years is a lot to invest into

2741.46 --> 2744.88
that

2743.079 --> 2747.7000000000003
it would be kind of a waste if you

2744.88 --> 2750.42
wouldn't actually perform them

2747.7 --> 2750.4199999999996
wouldn't it

2764.319 --> 2769.599
oh wow oh cool all right

2767.92 --> 2773.6800000000003
okay glad to hear you're at least

2769.599 --> 2777.099
applying yourself there that's awesome

2773.68 --> 2779.74
I mean maybe you could if you feel

2777.099 --> 2782.38
comfortable with that I don't know share

2779.74 --> 2784.839
a recording or something that you played

2782.38 --> 2786.52
in that would be interesting

2784.839 --> 2789.46
it doesn't have to be now or anything

2786.52 --> 2792.359
but if you have any and I'd like to

2789.46 --> 2792.359
listen to that

2794.859 --> 2799.98
oh wow music Movie music oh wow that is

2798.76 --> 2806.3190000000004

feel very lucky to be very very good at

times to make really complicated

2944.28 --> 2949.63

2948.4 --> 2951.46
mimic them

[Music]

2951.46 --> 2958.06
I do that because I can it's the one

2955.359 --> 2960.88
thing I can get right I mean my voice is

2958.06 --> 2962.74
not exactly the most amazing singing

2960.88 --> 2966.339
voice ever

2962.74 --> 2969.839

2966.339 --> 2969.839
really really do

[Music]

2995.5 --> 2998.099

3007.74 --> 3011.72
[Music]

3009.06 --> 3011.72
actually

3012.0 --> 3018.3
just put myself onto learning in the

3015.66 --> 3019.92
instrument especially classic the

3018.3 --> 3023.88
problem was always is that yeah I can't

3019.92 --> 3025.6800000000003
afford it and it makes [ __ ] noise all

3023.88 --> 3029.7200000000003
the time

3025.68 --> 3029.72
and that's really annoying

3031.02 --> 3036.9
like if I had like a

3033.3 --> 3040.619
a room that was like perfectly isolated

3036.9 --> 3041.76
in sound or like like a silence room or

3040.619 --> 3044.579
something

3041.76 --> 3047.1600000000003
dude then if I'd always had that access

3044.579 --> 3048.54
then I would be much more inclined to

3047.16 --> 3050.7
actually start

3048.54 --> 3053.88
doing some music because I could just

3050.7 --> 3055.7999999999997
[ __ ] around without everybody in the

3053.88 --> 3058.5
entire neighborhood hearing it all the

3055.8 --> 3060.119
time especially how much I suck at the

3058.5 --> 3062.88
start just something I don't want

3060.119 --> 3065.119
everybody to hear

3062.88 --> 3065.119
foreign

3065.88 --> 3072.2400000000002
a big part of why I just didn't ever do

3069.0 --> 3074.819
that is because freaking musicians

3072.24 --> 3077.839
always make noise

3074.819 --> 3077.839
and it sucks

3079.319 --> 3081.98
I mean

3083.099 --> 3089.76
I was in the middle of that

3086.52 --> 3092.28
of course but like even some of the

3089.76 --> 3095.3390000000004
students from my mother

3092.28 --> 3097.8590000000004
one student even like went to live over

3095.339 --> 3101.42
at our place in like a separate little

3097.859 --> 3101.42
house like a back house

3103.079 --> 3106.8
and he was playing drums and [ __ ] and we

3105.3 --> 3108.78
could just hear that straight through

3106.8 --> 3112.38
the entire house

3108.78 --> 3114.48
my mother it drove her nuts but

3112.38 --> 3117.1800000000003
yeah maybe that's it it's because my

3114.48 --> 3119.16
mother was always so quick to be

3117.18 --> 3122.66
agitated from sound

3119.16 --> 3122.66
that I just never

3123.9 --> 3129.7200000000003
I was always just like how can I make

3126.359 --> 3133.7599999999998
everything perfectly silent

3129.72 --> 3133.7599999999998

3146.64 --> 3153.14
okay or a knuckle Womble

by the way my favorite game of that

3277.8 --> 3283.02
computer pretty much

3280.079 --> 3284.819
like even now I keep playing it on a

3283.02 --> 3287.7
simulator sometimes

3284.819 --> 3289.14
but some of the songs are really

3287.7 --> 3292.7999999999997
exciting

3289.14 --> 3296.94
and with the Deep violin type things and

3292.8 --> 3298.7400000000002
that's that style is very Gustav Holst

3296.94 --> 3302.42
I think like my brother or something

3298.74 --> 3302.4199999999996
told me about that first

3303.839 --> 3307.22
like hey that's like him

3309.119 --> 3315.7200000000003
maybe it's because Gustav just gets that

3311.819 --> 3318.96
that exciting thrilling scary

3315.72 --> 3320.7
sound so well done so yeah if you want

3318.96 --> 3322.8
in your video game or in your movie you

3320.7 --> 3325.319
want something to be really eerie and

3322.8 --> 3327.599
like making you a bit uncomfortable but

3325.319 --> 3331.44
still very exciting

3327.599 --> 3332.819
yeah Gustav Holst is the style

3331.44 --> 3335.3
[Music]

3332.819 --> 3335.3
anyway

3342.079 --> 3346.6400000000003
right also by the way because

3347.7 --> 3353.8799999999997
a lot of other classical music is just

3350.94 --> 3357.0
very in your face it takes up all your

3353.88 --> 3360.119
attention right to to be part of that to

3357.0 --> 3361.26
like so very spectacular in your face

3360.119 --> 3363.96
and

3361.26 --> 3365.94
it takes up all your attention well some

3363.96 --> 3368.76
of these things from Gustav Holst are

3365.94 --> 3372.18
kind of sneaky and in the background

3368.76 --> 3376.2000000000003
there's a natural side effect to this

3372.18 --> 3378.4199999999996
mainly that if you put that like in a

3376.2 --> 3382.319
video game or in a movie in a certain

3378.42 --> 3385.859
scene you don't really notice it

3382.319 --> 3387.66
it just becomes that feeling

3385.859 --> 3390.24
and you could just

3387.66 --> 3391.92
move it in there and people typically

3390.24 --> 3395.16
will not

3391.92 --> 3397.5
like even realize that

3395.16 --> 3400.94
it would just get that feeling like whoa

3397.5 --> 3400.94
there's something going on here

3409.98 --> 3416.059
I think that

3412.68 --> 3416.0589999999997
what was it

3420.18 --> 3423.66
right one of the movies that does this

3421.98 --> 3425.46
really great I don't know if he they

3423.66 --> 3427.3799999999997
actually literally took from Gustav

3425.46 --> 3430.079
Holst but they they might have I should

3427.38 --> 3431.7000000000003
have to re-watch it one time it's a good

3430.079 --> 3433.8
movie anyway because of the music and

3431.7 --> 3436.22
that's Predator the original Predator in

3433.8 --> 3436.2200000000003
the jungle

3437.64 --> 3444.5589999999997
they got some really interesting classic

3440.24 --> 3444.5589999999997
hybrid with more modern

3444.96 --> 3449.94
Style

3447.42 --> 3453.8
some keyboard but it's really

3449.94 --> 3453.8
interesting how they blended it all

3459.78 --> 3466.1400000000003
right interesting movie beautiful scenes

3463.339 --> 3471.319
and great music and that's what made

3466.14 --> 3471.319
Predator such a big score movie

3471.599 --> 3476.88
it's still great I mean every time I

3474.66 --> 3479.64
watch it it's always like oh [ __ ] it

3476.88 --> 3482.1800000000003
just never gets old that doesn't really

3479.64 --> 3482.18
get old

3482.52 --> 3485.0
okay

something

3721.799 --> 3728.099
or more music I mean if you got more

3724.74 --> 3731.5989999999997
share it's just that I can't always be

3728.099 --> 3731.599
talking about music constantly

3733.38 --> 3737.299
I'm not that much of an expert

3738.24 --> 3740.9599999999996
enjoy it

3751.079 --> 3755.63
huh

3753.299 --> 3758.7889999999998
what the

3755.63 --> 3758.789
[Music]

3760.799 --> 3765.02
okay well that's weird

3771.42 --> 3775.38
okay

3773.339 --> 3779.4
so there's this situation here in the

3775.38 --> 3782.119
Netherlands I found some other subject

3779.4 --> 3782.119
where

3784.619 --> 3789.6600000000003
there's literally people from the

3787.26 --> 3795.7200000000003
judicial system

3789.66 --> 3797.52
trying to make uh Mark rutta get resign

3795.72 --> 3799.74
because of all kinds of terrible

3797.52 --> 3802.92
situations and he absolutely needs to go

3799.74 --> 3807.359
right but now he's saying

3802.92 --> 3810.42
I need some more time to think about

3807.359 --> 3814.52
whether I'm going to resign

3810.42 --> 3814.52
because of that like what

3814.92 --> 3818.94
the [ __ ]

3816.839 --> 3821.099
is that how that works

3818.94 --> 3822.66
it's up to you whether you're going to

3821.099 --> 3826.88
accept

3822.66 --> 3826.8799999999997
your criminal charges is it

3829.68 --> 3834.24
so that's happening apparently but yeah

3832.2 --> 3836.22
as I said things are rolling in the

3834.24 --> 3838.8799999999997
Netherlands and it's not gonna take too

3836.22 --> 3838.8799999999997
much longer

3839.04 --> 3842.0

3852.22 --> 3858.18
[Music]

3858.38 --> 3863.6600000000003
oh he is a special boy I mean yes

3864.119 --> 3869.599
he's also

3866.28 --> 3872.28
a mercenary to Satan

3869.599 --> 3875.339
so yeah

3872.28 --> 3878.1600000000003
I don't care how special he is it's time

3875.339 --> 3879.839
for him to [ __ ] off

3878.16 --> 3881.819
then

3879.839 --> 3885.44
yeah

3881.819 --> 3885.44
potentially permanently

3886.26 --> 3893.579
you can't just keep going on a plan that

3889.319 --> 3896.04
basically is against all the people

3893.579 --> 3899.4
I mean

3896.04 --> 3900.839
kings and queens sometimes have it in

3899.4 --> 3902.46
their head that they can do that and

3900.839 --> 3904.2599999999998
keep doing that and just play their

3902.46 --> 3907.68
people for a very long time and even

3904.26 --> 3910.2000000000003
they just get killed

3907.68 --> 3912.54
every now and then

3910.2 --> 3914.9399999999996
I'm not too periodically

3912.54 --> 3917.52
right so if you're just a prime minister

3914.94 --> 3920.16
and you're gonna roll out a plan where

3917.52 --> 3922.92
you're literally acting like you're a

3920.16 --> 3925.0789999999997
king or you're like a team of the king

3922.92 --> 3926.4
that is just can't just do that to the

3925.079 --> 3929.3390000000004
people

3926.4 --> 3931.6800000000003
yeah you think that you can avoid the

3929.339 --> 3934.2599999999998
same type of fate

3931.68 --> 3935.8399999999997
I don't think so that's pretty

3934.26 --> 3939.059
delusional

3935.84 --> 3944.04
[Music]

3939.059 --> 3946.98

3946.98 --> 3951.18
playing it he's to him it must be like

3949.44 --> 3952.38
he's LARPing or something it just

3951.18 --> 3954.96
doesn't matter

3952.38 --> 3956.4
how devastating it all is just keeps

3954.96 --> 3958.41
going

3956.4 --> 3961.62
but that can't just keep going

3958.41 --> 3961.62
[Music]

3963.78 --> 3967.8590000000004
destroyed the new British prime minister

3965.819 --> 3969.72
I'm leaving it what

3967.859 --> 3973.819
oh the Press oh well that's a good sign

3969.72 --> 3973.819
that means they might be good

3974.52 --> 3980.46
I mean the Press is the main problem the

3978.119 --> 3981.6600000000003
press in the west is so utterly

3980.46 --> 3984.42
corrupted

3981.66 --> 3986.22
there should be physical consequences

3984.42 --> 3987.51
for these people

3986.22 --> 3988.859
physical

[Music]

3988.859 --> 3994.0789999999997
yeah this idea that just because you're

3991.859 --> 3997.799
in Media or something that you can just

3994.079 --> 4000.079
do anything and just oh you get closed

3997.799 --> 4003.2599999999998
off or you get a fight no no how about

4000.079 --> 4005.6600000000003
some visceral punishment

4003.26 --> 4008.6600000000003
for your blatant

4005.66 --> 4012.46
violation

4008.66 --> 4017.359
and your attack overt psychological

4012.46 --> 4018.799
assault and preponderance of lies within

4017.359 --> 4022.52
that assault

4018.799 --> 4024.98
on your or your National people on the

4022.52 --> 4026.48
people there where you're aiming it at

4024.98 --> 4027.98
yeah

4026.48 --> 4029.839
there should be some serious

4027.98 --> 4032.299
consequences for the media I think that

4029.839 --> 4034.94
the media has become the main problem

4032.299 --> 4035.9
even above politicians and the judicial

4034.94 --> 4039.5
system

4035.9 --> 4042.28
I think the media is the main problem

4039.5 --> 4045.5
they've become so horrifically terrible

4042.28 --> 4047.96
but pretty much because they think they

4045.5 --> 4050.48
can literally get away with anything

4047.96 --> 4052.64
imaginable they think they can get away

4050.48 --> 4056.44
with everything

4052.64 --> 4059.839
because of freedom of speech

4056.44 --> 4062.48
journalist rights which only apply to

4059.839 --> 4065.0589999999997
them and everybody else immediately gets

4062.48 --> 4068.42
canned and [ __ ] on

4065.059 --> 4071.3590000000004

4327.08 --> 4333.8
and they're all going to be rounded up

4329.98 --> 4336.199
and executed one by one it's probably

4333.8 --> 4338.719
gonna take 50 years to get it all done

4336.199 --> 4340.96
but it will happen and there will be no

4338.719 --> 4344.17
exception

4340.96 --> 4344.17
[Music]

4346.82 --> 4351.0199999999995
I mean if you thought that the Nuremberg

4348.739 --> 4353.12
trials were complicated and

4351.02 --> 4354.620000000001
controversial and like even a little

4353.12 --> 4357.0199999999995
corrupted here and there

4354.62 --> 4359.42
yeah

4357.02 --> 4362.84
now this one's gonna be

4359.42 --> 4365.6
well it's a literal worldwide skill this

4362.84 --> 4371.1990000000005
is not just Germany and Poland and [ __ ]

4365.6 --> 4371.1990000000005
yeah this is the whole [ __ ] world

4371.54 --> 4377.179
the scale is going to be so much faster

4374.239 --> 4380.599999999999
but then again there is now the internet

4377.179 --> 4382.88
things are quicker

4380.6 --> 4383.780000000001
quicker researched

4382.88 --> 4386.719
Etc

4383.78 --> 4388.5199999999995
so that will help somewhat if can you

4386.719 --> 4390.199
imagine that we'd have to do all that

4388.52 --> 4392.120000000001
without the internet well they wouldn't

4390.199 --> 4393.98
have even been as successful in

4392.12 --> 4396.26
spreading their misinformation and death

4393.98 --> 4398.959999999999
without the internet

4396.26 --> 4400.88
so it kind of evens out but can you

4398.96 --> 4403.52
imagine like trying to do all that

4400.88 --> 4406.04
without internet that's gonna take

4403.52 --> 4409.88
longer than most of these people even

4406.04 --> 4412.04
have left naturally that would take like

4409.88 --> 4414.02
a hundred years or something it's just

4412.04 --> 4415.58
it's just not doable

4414.02 --> 4418.580000000001
so much

4415.58 --> 4420.5599999999995
unless everybody all just organizes it

4418.58 --> 4423.0199999999995
at the same time everywhere that there's

4420.56 --> 4425.54
like a decent who knows I don't know I'm

4423.02 --> 4429.080000000001
not gonna get too much into it but

4425.54 --> 4432.38
I am trusting very much so that it is

4429.08 --> 4434.48
going to happen because it was like my

4432.38 --> 4437.36
one ultimate demand

4434.48 --> 4440.178999999999
in the dark world even towards God and

4437.36 --> 4442.699
everything it's like it's all fine like

4440.179 --> 4445.82
do to me whatever the [ __ ] you want

4442.699 --> 4448.94
under one specific condition

4445.82 --> 4450.5
that I before I go before my

4448.94 --> 4452.599999999999
Consciousness is no longer able to

4450.5 --> 4456.739
assimilate new information

4452.6 --> 4459.08
I will see all these people that are

4456.739 --> 4461.718999999999
literally at the root of this my entire

4459.08 --> 4464.9
life even before I was born that I will

4461.719 --> 4467.2390000000005
see them all die

4464.9 --> 4470.96
with the look in their eyes that they

4467.239 --> 4474.379999999999
know it's over forever now

4470.96 --> 4477.32
and then after I've witnessed that

4474.38 --> 4479.2390000000005
within my living body

4477.32 --> 4481.699
after that point it doesn't really

4479.239 --> 4484.459999999999
matter anymore I don't know put me in

4481.699 --> 4486.0199999999995
there kill me strangle me in an alley

4484.46 --> 4487.64
poison me I don't give a [ __ ] what

4486.02 --> 4490.820000000001
happens to me

4487.64 --> 4492.860000000001
I just want that one thing all these

4490.82 --> 4496.759999999999
[ __ ] people that have done this that

4492.86 --> 4501.08
have basically made me Sprout up in a

4496.76 --> 4503.12
Hell world I want them all dead

4501.08 --> 4506.0
all of them

4503.12 --> 4508.599999999999
there will be no more sneaking away

4506.0 --> 4508.6
Grappler

4510.92 --> 4515.659
it's my one demand my one ultimate

4514.699 --> 4518.9
demand

4515.659 --> 4521.719
that I even prioritized over having a

4518.9 --> 4524.0
normal life or anything

4521.719 --> 4527.42
you could compare to that

4524.0 --> 4530.3
that's how much I want that

4527.42 --> 4531.38
it's the one thing I wanted as soon as I

4530.3 --> 4534.4400000000005
woke up

4531.38 --> 4537.14
the one thing I wanted

4534.44 --> 4541.159
they must all pay

4537.14 --> 4542.96
they must pay this is not a thing you

4541.159 --> 4544.099999999999
put in the back of your mind and just

4542.96 --> 4546.26
hope

4544.1 --> 4547.88
and just let it flee

4546.26 --> 4550.159000000001
and then you die and it never happened

4547.88 --> 4554.0
and you don't have to face it no no I

4550.159 --> 4556.58
will see them all dead

4554.0 --> 4558.32
not through delusion not through

4556.58 --> 4562.64
animation

4558.32 --> 4565.54
through Live recorded footage of them

4562.64 --> 4565.54
dying

4566.62 --> 4570.219
one way or the other

4571.73 --> 4577.459999999999
[Music]

4575.36 --> 4579.639999999999
yeah we're talking about millions of

4577.46 --> 4579.64
people

4584.32 --> 4589.659
or basically the entire Old Guard pretty

4587.48 --> 4589.659
much

4603.92 --> 4606.92
foreign

4611.659 --> 4615.739
for starters anything associating with

4614.48 --> 4619.78
Marxism

4615.739 --> 4619.78
anything at all

4620.3 --> 4623.4400000000005
and that's a lot

4634.76 --> 4637.76
right

4640.34 --> 4642.88
foreign

4643.719 --> 4650.42
matter like who it is it what matters to

4646.88 --> 4652.1
me is that it's a group of people that

4650.42 --> 4654.02
are susceptible to it and that are

4652.1 --> 4656.179
motivated to keep doing it

4654.02 --> 4659.900000000001
and that needs to be broken because once

4656.179 --> 4661.4
these Grapplers lose Satan

4659.9 --> 4664.099999999999
like that

4661.4 --> 4665.96
they'll just fizzle so that's kind of

4664.1 --> 4670.4800000000005
what I really want I just want them all

4665.96 --> 4670.4800000000005
to fizzle and just die and go to hell

4671.06 --> 4676.88
this plan has to stop this supposed plan

4674.54 --> 4681.62
to rule the world through the evil set

4676.88 --> 4682.9400000000005
of people it has to end forever and it

4681.62 --> 4685.58
will come back

4682.94 --> 4688.58
but everybody that's on to that and that

4685.58 --> 4690.92
has been driving

4688.58 --> 4693.739
that vehicle

4690.92 --> 4696.46
they must pay

4693.739 --> 4700.04
a signal must be sent

4696.46 --> 4702.07
spiritually through the dimensions it's

4700.04 --> 4704.179
over

4702.07 --> 4706.84
[Music]

4704.179 --> 4724.21
foreign

4706.84 --> 4724.21
[Music]

4724.64 --> 4728.179
but there's gonna be even more

4726.5 --> 4730.699
complications though

4728.179 --> 4732.56
even if those [ __ ] old Crohn's and

4730.699 --> 4734.659
disgusting rabblers

4732.56 --> 4737.719
that have basically all created this

4734.659 --> 4739.639999999999
even if they go there's new generation

4737.719 --> 4743.4800000000005
of basically

4739.64 --> 4745.400000000001
hybrid gojim Orcs

4743.48 --> 4748.218999999999
they're like hybrid gaussian they're

4745.4 --> 4750.259999999999
like Jews that aren't actually Jews

4748.219 --> 4752.06
they're Goji but they think they're like

4750.26 --> 4754.1
Jews and they act like Jews and they are

4752.06 --> 4756.8
slaves to them

4754.1 --> 4758.0
they're not talking about actual Hebrews

4756.8 --> 4761.3
and

4758.0 --> 4764.0
Torah followers I'm talking about yeah

4761.3 --> 4765.84
so difficult or even appropriately use

4764.0 --> 4767.3
the word Jew

4765.84 --> 4768.9800000000005
[Music]

4767.3 --> 4771.08
yeah

4768.98 --> 4773.178999999999
what I mean is that there's a whole

4771.08 --> 4775.58
bunch of people that have been raised on

4773.179 --> 4778.34
demonic skills

4775.58 --> 4781.4
for like 20 years now

4778.34 --> 4783.82
that new generation is gonna be the main

4781.4 --> 4783.82
problem

4785.42 --> 4790.159
because we cannot just do the same to

4788.96 --> 4792.5
them

4790.159 --> 4793.879999999999
as to the ones that originally organized

4792.5 --> 4797.02
this because

4793.88 --> 4797.02
they're the youth

4797.78 --> 4803.96
and we kind of need them

4800.96 --> 4806.62
if you just like take care of them yeah

4803.96 --> 4806.62
what then

4808.88 --> 4813.62
I know maybe it could be done maybe

4811.58 --> 4816.0199999999995
it's like okay well now we got the

4813.62 --> 4818.599999999999
younger generation of [ __ ] up demons

4816.02 --> 4820.400000000001
and take care of that prison

4818.6 --> 4822.8
whatever

4820.4 --> 4827.239
and then just like promote okay let's

4822.8 --> 4830.54
get another baby boom Going like we need

4827.239 --> 4833.12
to fill out the ranks

4830.54 --> 4835.28
because there's like almost an entire

4833.12 --> 4837.62
generation that's just cut out of the

4835.28 --> 4839.78
picture because of this

4837.62 --> 4841.76
that's got to be filled up with a newer

4839.78 --> 4845.23
generation that's probably going to be

4841.76 --> 4849.1990000000005
pushed to grow up quicker

4845.23 --> 4851.839999999999
[Music]

4849.199 --> 4854.259999999999
so I don't know I'm I'm thinking too

4851.84 --> 4856.04
broad at this point

4854.26 --> 4858.8
[Music]

4856.04 --> 4861.44
but yeah yeah I am a little obsessed by

4858.8 --> 4864.92
it I always have been I was with it

4861.44 --> 4867.259999999999
before I even got in the Flat Earth

4864.92 --> 4870.04
and intricately linked to the Visions

4867.26 --> 4870.04
too

4874.5 --> 4877.739
[Music]

4877.76 --> 4881.780000000001
maybe that's what the 80 years of hell

4879.92 --> 4883.6990000000005
was even about

4881.78 --> 4886.639999999999
because I do remember that I made that

4883.699 --> 4889.94
declaration in the Dark World very early

4886.64 --> 4892.820000000001
I did it early

4889.94 --> 4896.799999999999
in direct response to being confronted

4892.82 --> 4896.799999999999
with how [ __ ] up the world really was

4902.14 --> 4906.860000000001
in reality I was just trying to be

4904.52 --> 4909.5
pragmatic

4906.86 --> 4911.599999999999
and like oh oh so there's actually an

4909.5 --> 4913.699
evil that's ruining it all okay well

4911.6 --> 4916.219
then I dedicate my entire life to

4913.699 --> 4919.58
destroying that evil

4916.219 --> 4922.699
that's pretty much what it is

4919.58 --> 4926.96
yeah when you say such things

4922.699 --> 4929.9
in that place in that other dimension

4926.96 --> 4933.14
you can't take it back

4929.9 --> 4935.799999999999
your internal World simply will not let

4933.14 --> 4935.8
you do that

4939.35 --> 4946.88
[Music]

4945.08 --> 4948.5599999999995
targeting children they're growing up on

4946.88 --> 4949.9400000000005
the wrong side yeah and they will be the

4948.56 --> 4953.4800000000005
trash

4949.94 --> 4954.919999999999
of the next two decades they will be

4953.48 --> 4958.58
that

4954.92 --> 4962.0
like the white trash for example but

4958.58 --> 4965.62
other it's not just White

4962.0 --> 4969.32
but that's what a lot of these

4965.62 --> 4972.08
indoctrinated freaks are turning into

4969.32 --> 4974.54
they're yeah because they are it's all

4972.08 --> 4976.5199999999995
Marxist you see all of it is the entire

4974.54 --> 4978.08
program the Demonic program it's all

4976.52 --> 4981.38
Marxist because the only thing they're

4978.08 --> 4983.719
trying to do is just disrupt the

4981.38 --> 4987.7390000000005
productivity of generations

4983.719 --> 4989.56
it's an overt attack on the welfare

4987.739 --> 4993.5199999999995
of the nation

4989.56 --> 4993.52
everything they do is

4994.4 --> 4999.92
Yeah by attacking the minds of a

4998.3 --> 5003.04
generation

4999.92 --> 5007.12
you literally attack the productivity

5003.04 --> 5009.57

5007.12 --> 5011.679
it's a direct assault

5009.57 --> 5014.38
[Music]

5011.679 --> 5017.28
it's an act of War

5014.38 --> 5017.28
arguably

5018.92 --> 5022.57
[Music]

5021.34 --> 5024.1
right

5022.57 --> 5027.099999999999
[Music]

5024.1 --> 5027.1
anyway

5027.76 --> 5030.54
I think I'm gonna

5030.64 --> 5034.8
round the show out pretty soon

5035.13 --> 5050.869
[Music]

5062.5 --> 5068.86
spiritual every day yeah and also it's

5065.5 --> 5071.62
it's like the same origin of communism

5068.86 --> 5073.54
or like not literally comments but it's

5071.62 --> 5075.159
the just the freaking Marxism every time

5073.54 --> 5076.719
by the way that was even mentioned in

5075.159 --> 5078.339999999999
the Charlie Chaplin movie for a second

5076.719 --> 5080.02
it was interesting

5078.34 --> 5082.12
somebody else like oh

5080.02 --> 5085.42
that guy could be from the Communist

5082.12 --> 5088.78
party and then the other guy said like

5085.42 --> 5090.34
no because he can't actually pay the

5088.78 --> 5093.28
dues

5090.34 --> 5096.400000000001
right because communism even back then

5093.28 --> 5098.92
it's for rich people

5096.4 --> 5102.42
because it's all a lie

5098.92 --> 5105.9400000000005
communism is rich people

5102.42 --> 5107.56
weaponizing indoctrination to be exactly

5105.94 --> 5109.78
the opposite

5107.56 --> 5111.820000000001
of what they actually are so they're

5109.78 --> 5114.94
saying we're helping the poor no no no

5111.82 --> 5117.34
you're exploiting the poor that's what

5114.94 --> 5119.739
you're actually doing

5117.34 --> 5122.8
yeah we're here to help oh so you're

5119.739 --> 5124.9
here to explore and Destroy exploit and

5122.8 --> 5127.54
Destroy yeah

5124.9 --> 5130.839999999999
That's What communists do it's they're

5127.54 --> 5133.0
rich against the poor

5130.84 --> 5135.52
that's what it actually is it's

5133.0 --> 5138.219
completely satanic and inverted and they

5135.52 --> 5140.1990000000005
lie about all of it they might not even

5138.219 --> 5142.179
consciously realize some of these people

5140.199 --> 5143.98
that they are lying because they don't

5142.179 --> 5145.36
understand what it is they're doing they

5143.98 --> 5148.178999999999
don't understand communism they don't

5145.36 --> 5153.4
understand Marxism but effectively and

5148.179 --> 5155.92
on the long run that is what it is

5153.4 --> 5160.0199999999995
they don't help the poor

5155.92 --> 5160.02
they exploit the poor

5160.78 --> 5163.92
bind them

5164.38 --> 5168.900000000001
they make them do their dirty work

5169.08 --> 5173.08
and then

5170.86 --> 5176.46
they don't get richer

5173.08 --> 5176.46
they never do

5176.5 --> 5186.699
only the select the elite gets richer

5182.199 --> 5189.58
and with that richness Comes The Vow oh

5186.699 --> 5192.4
you're rich okay well that means that

5189.58 --> 5194.8
you must then understand that the only

5192.4 --> 5197.04
purpose for the rich is to attack the

5194.8 --> 5197.04
poor

5197.8 --> 5202.06
and if you don't sign on to that you get

5199.84 --> 5203.679
ejected you're not part of their system

5202.06 --> 5207.580000000001
anymore

5203.679 --> 5210.28
and that is the Core Essence of Marxism

5207.58 --> 5215.679
and communism

5210.28 --> 5217.12
it's how they all operate no exception

5215.679 --> 5219.159
yeah

5217.12 --> 5221.98
if you think that the freaking United

5219.159 --> 5222.82
States and their way of doing things is

5221.98 --> 5226.599999999999
better

5222.82 --> 5228.0
or capitalist and [ __ ] think again

5226.6 --> 5231.1
I mean

5228.0 --> 5232.96
America's government system

5231.1 --> 5235.900000000001
is

5232.96 --> 5237.34
covert communism it is absolutely

5235.9 --> 5241.239
communist

5237.34 --> 5242.860000000001
but it pretends like their capitalist it

5241.239 --> 5245.86
isn't

5242.86 --> 5245.86
which

5247.06 --> 5253.0
that potentially makes it worse than

5249.76 --> 5256.6
communism because actual serious

5253.0 --> 5259.78
communism has advanced advantages

5256.6 --> 5262.2390000000005
especially industrial advantages right

5259.78 --> 5263.32
if there's a communist system like in

5262.239 --> 5266.62
China

5263.32 --> 5269.92
and the people that are in there

5266.62 --> 5274.78
actually care to improve their country

5269.92 --> 5278.1990000000005
then great things can be accomplished

5274.78 --> 5280.8
but if the communist government or

5278.199 --> 5284.0199999999995
covert communist government

5280.8 --> 5286.06
isn't actually interested in helping the

5284.02 --> 5289.4800000000005
country and they just wouldn't exploit

5286.06 --> 5292.780000000001
the poor yeah that not a lot of great

5289.48 --> 5297.218999999999
things are accomplished and you breed

5292.78 --> 5299.679
useless demonic people that way

5297.219 --> 5300.94
for your country right so communism

5299.679 --> 5305.02
without

5300.94 --> 5307.719
actual national interests and Noble

5305.02 --> 5311.5
spirited leadership is a giant disaster

5307.719 --> 5314.9800000000005
then again every form of government with

5311.5 --> 5318.639
a leader like that is a giant disaster

5314.98 --> 5322.138999999999
but just saying that even communism can

5318.639 --> 5322.139
potentially work

5322.9 --> 5326.86
as long

5324.34 --> 5329.56
as there's a serious National spirit and

5326.86 --> 5331.719
it's not just a Marxist infiltrator

5329.56 --> 5332.92
group that wants to destroy and exploit

5331.719 --> 5336.78
the country

5332.92 --> 5336.78
which is exactly what America has

5337.54 --> 5343.239
and well

5339.94 --> 5346.599999999999
my country arguably as well

5343.239 --> 5348.959999999999
right Marxist infiltrators to destroy

5346.6 --> 5348.96
the country

5352.6 --> 5358.3
right but that's also where basically

5355.659 --> 5360.699
the road of Marxism and communism can

5358.3 --> 5363.04
split apart because Marxism

5360.699 --> 5366.339999999999
is never nationalism

5363.04 --> 5368.679
it's anti-nationalism well

5366.34 --> 5370.719
nationalist communism

5368.679 --> 5374.6990000000005
is basically safeguarded from those

5370.719 --> 5374.699
effects and those influences

5375.1 --> 5380.820000000001
right that's why Chinese communism is

5378.219 --> 5380.82
very different

5381.9 --> 5387.699
from well the Marxist infiltrators that

5385.78 --> 5389.62
we've got all over Europe and in the

5387.699 --> 5391.719
United States

5389.62 --> 5393.58
very different it's a completely

5391.719 --> 5395.9800000000005
different angle of approach a different

5393.58 --> 5398.82
form of Communism you cannot really

5395.98 --> 5398.82
compare the two

5399.04 --> 5405.46
right anyway

5401.679 --> 5408.219
it's a bit of a last minute subject

5405.46 --> 5410.38
I just did want to think about that and

5408.219 --> 5411.94
say these things right but I'm gonna

5410.38 --> 5415.0
round out the show

5411.94 --> 5417.159
