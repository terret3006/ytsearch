6.07 --> 36.7
[Music]

37.76 --> 45.718999999999994
good morning welcome to flatter the

42.059 --> 57.899
earlybird number 118 I'm your host

45.719 --> 59.120000000000005
Arwen and testing testing yeah here it

57.899 --> 63.769
is

59.12 --> 70.32
it's a big one it's heavy

63.769 --> 74.25
it has dials all over the place and a

70.32 --> 80.99
mute button very good so I can shut

74.25 --> 85.28999999999999
myself up extra volume control weird

80.99 --> 89.54899999999999
loopy settings like yeah different

85.29 --> 93.39
patterns okay interesting

89.549 --> 93.99000000000001
gain I have no idea but is always good I

93.39 --> 99.89
guess

93.99 --> 99.89
although too much very good and yeah

99.92 --> 111.93
mute button volume for headphone so yeah

103.979 --> 118.049
I can phone in this thing but yeah it's

111.93 --> 122.46000000000001
mainly USB so yeah how's the sound guys

118.049 --> 125.659
I have to go completely what you guys

122.46 --> 125.65899999999999
tell me for now

130.66 --> 141.62
Shayne Walter screw you the old the old

139.31 --> 143.81
microphone was kind of convenient

141.62 --> 146.23000000000002
because it's cutting in and out

143.81 --> 146.23
really

154.54 --> 166.51999999999998
are you guys just screwing around with

157.25 --> 168.86
me okay I'm gonna put headphones in this

166.52 --> 171.52
thing and hear if I can actually hear

168.86 --> 171.52
something myself

179.41 --> 187.99
you have to like keep your it's like

183.38 --> 187.99
this too close I have no idea

188.209 --> 198.739
kink in the cable controls our look I

197.15 --> 204.519
don't know what the front and the back

198.739 --> 204.519
of this thing is at all I have no clue

207.849 --> 233.20999999999998
okay right Wow I can't actually hear

213.17 --> 236.259
myself right let's try this okay okay

233.21 --> 236.25900000000001
[Music]

237.04 --> 242.469
directionality that is weird

242.95 --> 249.939
let's try this direction I mean not so

246.769 --> 253.06900000000002
much it seems right so the first one has

249.939 --> 260.59
like a directionality thing going with

253.069 --> 260.59
this right right right right right right

262.75 --> 270.849
and this one what does that do okay well

280.47 --> 290.1
one it's very directional for some

284.56 --> 292.39
reason all right

290.1 --> 297.51000000000005
anyway are you guys getting any more

292.39 --> 297.51
noise cuz I I'm not

299.69 --> 310.89
okay it is not yet it is not pop proof

306.21 --> 315.63
though obviously so how does it sound

310.89 --> 321.27
from this whoa man this thing can pick

315.63 --> 322.83
up some holy [ __ ] but speak from this

321.27 --> 324.45
distance with the other microphone I

322.83 --> 331.14
have weird nothing

324.45 --> 333.81
that's amazing this thing I got a

331.14 --> 340.08
careful what I wish for and somebody's

333.81 --> 341.97
here behind I'm gonna have to like start

340.08 --> 346.77
screwing around with this thing a really

341.97 --> 351.23
experiment what it all does because it's

346.77 --> 355.16999999999996
not so simple as with the other one

351.23 --> 357.8
which just sucked that was like the most

355.17 --> 361.77000000000004
straightforward thing about it it's a

357.8 --> 364.8
this one does not I think it's very

361.77 --> 368.9
beautiful eloquent design it has

364.8 --> 371.28000000000003
functions don't really understand them

368.9 --> 378.57
didn't come with an instruction manual

371.28 --> 385.26
either just like a box with yetis on it

378.57 --> 387.03
and that's about it just says look can

385.26 --> 395.34
do all these things and it says it in

387.03 --> 401.57
different languages but I bet I can look

395.34 --> 401.57
that up online probably find some

404.71 --> 415.88899999999995
what okay turn the mic around really

409.8 --> 415.889
like this is that better

417.78 --> 422.54999999999995
it's this the way it's supposed to be

427.08 --> 451.18
okay you guys so how did you how do you

433.18 --> 456.19
even know if I talk from this side I can

451.18 --> 459.88
hear this louder that's funny

456.19 --> 465.3
okay right so this is the way I'm

459.88 --> 466.77
supposed to face this thing fine okay

465.3 --> 469.63
cool

466.77 --> 473.31
this thing it really is in the way of my

469.63 --> 473.31
keyboard though a lot

475.65 --> 482.14
[Music]

478.54 --> 492.03000000000003
anyway yeah I got a new mic oh yeah and

482.14 --> 492.03
I got new pants it's still black so

493.35 --> 496.35
behold

498.479 --> 506.21
yep it's pants they fit perfectly and I

503.879 --> 506.21000000000004
love them

514.01 --> 518.039
controls yep

515.639 --> 527.4300000000001
stop booking traffic in my restaurant

518.039 --> 529.709
but their controls on both sides that's

527.43 --> 532.949
a silly thing about it all right I'm

529.709 --> 535.17
gonna test this game button what does

532.949 --> 542.459
that do what does this button do

535.17 --> 547.04
gein gein gein yeah does that why is

542.459 --> 547.04
that it's the volume lower now

549.11 --> 557.27
I don't know I my headphones I can

555.47 --> 563.35
barely pick anything up

557.27 --> 571.25
let's try happening and how is this oh

563.35 --> 574.22
that seems loud is this loud or is this

571.25 --> 579.17
the same for you guys this is just my

574.22 --> 581.24
headphones loudness or something what

579.17 --> 583.67
was the difference oh and by the way

581.24 --> 587.95
yeah thank you flat ball for the 5 pound

583.67 --> 587.9499999999999
super chair donation much appreciate it

588.88 --> 592.78
turn it back up

598.9 --> 604.149
what

601.24 --> 604.48
ah this is just my headphones okay good

604.149 --> 610.149
to know

604.48 --> 612.91
all right so this it's kind of the

610.149 --> 620.17
useful doubt it goes in here when I'm

612.91 --> 622.569
getting closer to my good it's good to

620.17 --> 626.519
test this out a couple of times so can I

622.569 --> 629.86
get a good feel as to what happens with

626.519 --> 632.619
what distance to the mic this this is

629.86 --> 640.3290000000001
this really does require some getting

632.619 --> 645.85
used to and this volume about this again

640.329 --> 646.689
oh yeah I can't hear anything now on my

645.85 --> 654.48
headphones

646.689 --> 658.929
can you guys hear anything hear anything

654.48 --> 664.029
yeah I do seem to pick up so oh yeah

658.929 --> 669.16
this is general mic output I think so

664.029 --> 675.42
you guys can probably hear this yeah we

669.16 --> 675.42
very quiet and how about now is it

681.73 --> 693.6700000000001
did I just hear the car driving by what

686.32 --> 697.57
that that's really sensitive okay let's

693.67 --> 701.7099999999999
put it back to the male part and this

697.57 --> 707.59
thing can do a lot that's incredible

701.71 --> 710.98
within up and just put it wide open and

707.59 --> 712.99
like hear the birds like hundreds of

710.98 --> 722.23
meters away just chirping and that kind

712.99 --> 725.83
of stuff this is really amazing so yeah

722.23 --> 731.14
this is just this is not really really

725.83 --> 746.38
bird this is just a short mic testing

731.14 --> 749.8
show is jumping game is jumping no no

746.38 --> 755.55
the dial I was just turning was called

749.8 --> 759.91
volume man I can hear myself sniffing

755.55 --> 766.27
careful okay so if I put it a little bit

759.91 --> 770.35
down and you can alright alright this is

766.27 --> 772.15
like a distance thing so now you can

770.35 --> 774.73
still hear me but only because I'm

772.15 --> 776.7099999999999
really close to the mic and you can

774.73 --> 783.15
probably not hear anything right now

776.71 --> 783.1500000000001
right I can barely hear myself now so

783.33 --> 801.72
it kind of puts up the sensitivity so

787.41 --> 809.3299999999999
you can hear so yeah thanks for helping

801.72 --> 809.33
me work out the mic test

817.93 --> 827.3199999999999
when you move away alright so let's see

823.52 --> 836.03
if I can like put this thing away and

827.32 --> 836.6600000000001
still work properly all right so how's

836.03 --> 845.89
this

836.66 --> 847.91
okay some guys still hear me here right

845.89 --> 852.9499999999999
you can hear this too all right

847.91 --> 854.9499999999999
that's really annoying oh God you just

852.95 --> 862.6
wait until the statue falls

854.95 --> 866.87
man that makes so much noise my sound my

862.6 --> 868.94
singing Bowl because yeah I wonder if

866.87 --> 871.9
it's gonna pick up that really low sound

868.94 --> 871.9000000000001
I'm gonna check it out

880.47 --> 884.5690000000001
I still hear me from here

899.17 --> 928.06
let's check this out definitely hear

911.81 --> 930.89
that let's try how low it can go oh yeah

928.06 --> 933.67
alright now you can hear what you've

930.89 --> 933.67
been missing out

955.34 --> 959.14
I'm so happy I got this mic

965.18 --> 969.4599999999999
no this is not a feedback

969.699 --> 978.019
and I'm not gonna put any water in it

972.649 --> 981.459
that's not that doesn't work this is

978.019 --> 990.73
awesome love it

981.459 --> 990.7299999999999
yeah kick ass I love this mic I love it

999.6 --> 1007.6990000000001
ah I'm so happy I got this I got the

1004.85 --> 1011.5400000000001
yaki I got the Yeti and not the snow

1007.699 --> 1016.91
globe because yeah it was aglow and it

1011.54 --> 1021.8
was well probably not so good as this it

1016.91 --> 1023.6
was assitive if I won then yeah it might

1021.8 --> 1026.4489999999998
have not been able to actually pick this

1023.6 --> 1032.27
kind of thing up so I'm so glad it did

1026.449 --> 1036.47
it's really cool Wow

1032.27 --> 1038.77
Oh new world of audio has opened up to

1036.47 --> 1038.77
our

1049.03 --> 1059.01
right it's my mic testing science well

1054.1 --> 1062.4699999999998
might be you know I can actually

1059.01 --> 1069.22
manipulate the variables of this

1062.47 --> 1073.84
man-made device though yeah I could even

1069.22 --> 1077.13
think about like my the sound of my

1073.84 --> 1085.1799999999998
voice that is man-made right

1077.13 --> 1089.5900000000001
but yeah isn't man kind of made as part

1085.18 --> 1092.8
of nature so if it is man

1089.59 --> 1095.9499999999998
is it part of nature or if it comes from

1092.8 --> 1099.1499999999999
man in some way is it then man-made yeah

1095.95 --> 1099.15
that's the question isn't it

1099.21 --> 1104.22
to make things unnecessarily complicated

1112.68 --> 1118.1100000000001
right so wait Algrim uncle says if I

1115.65 --> 1122.91
come closer to the mic it automatically

1118.11 --> 1126.56
lowers the volume really so this is like

1122.91 --> 1126.5600000000002
the really careful clothes

1140.5 --> 1146.38
right but I could probably talk just

1144.429 --> 1154.409
from this distance how's that sound

1146.38 --> 1154.409
that's still good how does it work

1161.96 --> 1168.1200000000001
okay gang is always jumping you say

1164.79 --> 1170.79
right alright so I'm gonna put the game

1168.12 --> 1173.85
down so how's that

1170.79 --> 1176.69
it's that better okay you guys still

1173.85 --> 1176.6899999999998
hear me from here

1182.81 --> 1188.56
stand on the balcony yeah free Tommy

1186.32 --> 1191.6599999999999
free Tommy aromasin indeed

1188.56 --> 1194.27
that's right that's crazy

1191.66 --> 1199.0600000000002
the guy's been arrested again by the

1194.27 --> 1199.06
freaking courts again for no damn reason

1200.17 --> 1211.9
this is just like the British Court is

1205.91 --> 1216.95
just going going full so freakin dark

1211.9 --> 1220.73
like people that are like yay British

1216.95 --> 1225.05
courts yeah bad and now it's like what's

1220.73 --> 1230.09
really you're going lower than that what

1225.05 --> 1233.45
the hell man anyway yeah I'll I'll test

1230.09 --> 1236.74
out the sound from the balcony let's see

1233.45 --> 1236.74
if you can still hear me from there

1260.08 --> 1267.49
to two and a half meters away could you

1262.9 --> 1271.6000000000001
hear that did you hear just something in

1267.49 --> 1278.74
the distance or or was it just clearly

1271.6 --> 1285.6399999999999
as normal I don't know cool so I put the

1278.74 --> 1290.86
game down isn't that better I really

1285.64 --> 1293.38
need some some guidance in somebody who

1290.86 --> 1301.2099999999998
actually really knows how to properly

1293.38 --> 1303.19
apply studio equipment ah yeah somebody

1301.21 --> 1305.65
like Patricia would be a master at it

1303.19 --> 1307.56
but yet she probably doesn't have time

1305.65 --> 1310.7800000000002
for the loop for that kind of nonsense

1307.56 --> 1314.02
but yeah if anybody would love to help

1310.78 --> 1317.8899999999999
me just not on the hangout but in the

1314.02 --> 1319.84
background test this out help me get get

1317.89 --> 1325.24
this straight how to deal with this mic

1319.84 --> 1329.9399999999998
that would be really cool what blow

1325.24 --> 1329.94
sound what really

1333.37 --> 1344.08
it still jumps in for you hey I don't

1339.009 --> 1346.32
know why does that I'm not doing

1344.08 --> 1346.32
anything

1349.26 --> 1357.539
is that the gain is that that what like

1353.1 --> 1359.549
if I put the gain the way to one side

1357.539 --> 1363.2
one what isn't this how's this

1359.549 --> 1363.2
can you hear anything now

1377.97 --> 1389.039
now on left speaker

1381.259 --> 1393.96
really you can only I look I can't hear

1389.039 --> 1396.509
anything on my headphones right now no

1393.96 --> 1399.0
not with the cable there's nothing to do

1396.509 --> 1401.659
I just turned the dial of gain all the

1399.0 --> 1401.659
way to one side

1406.6 --> 1418.4189999999999
right so thus gain have anything to do

1411.639 --> 1421.7199999999998
with that so I can yeah as soon as I put

1418.419 --> 1427.3890000000001
this back up I can hear my cell phones I

1421.72 --> 1434.71
don't know why and if I put it all the

1427.389 --> 1445.36
way how's that is it louder for you guys

1434.71 --> 1447.519
to hear this wow this just as loud okay

1445.36 --> 1452.7099999999998
I can actually hear cars in the

1447.519 --> 1455.6490000000001
background echo through my headphones so

1452.71 --> 1468.69
this is like the reach button right it

1455.649 --> 1468.6899999999998
really is is reach more reach

1479.81 --> 1492.45
Trat the mute button right okay good

1486.42 --> 1496.53
button works okay okay I think that's

1492.45 --> 1498.68
about it now right speaker what right

1496.53 --> 1502.35
speaker what what are you talking about

1498.68 --> 1518.64
does this thing even have directionality

1502.35 --> 1521.99
really I'm not hearing a lot of

1518.64 --> 1526.68
sharpness now in the sound can barely

1521.99 --> 1531.74
more bass it seems is this like that the

1526.68 --> 1531.74
anti pop thing

1536.43 --> 1539.42
left speaker

1544.76 --> 1547.48
okay

1559.95 --> 1567.21
all settings in the middle that there is

1562.71 --> 1576.93
no middle it's pattern it's look just

1567.21 --> 1580.3500000000001
look pattern there is no so yeah on this

1576.93 --> 1583.6200000000001
all the time and this seemed yeah it's a

1580.35 --> 1588.1699999999998
circle so I take it this is like the

1583.62 --> 1588.1699999999998
ability to pick up sound more widely

1588.83 --> 1600.6
just put it on there is four settings

1596.22 --> 1603.17
here that's it doesn't say what they

1600.6 --> 1603.1699999999998
actually do

1608.03 --> 1614.3
right so I'm gonna put it on this one

1612.97 --> 1619.6100000000001
Punk

1614.3 --> 1623.1499999999999
so okay what does this do all right you

1619.61 --> 1625.7299999999998
can you can hear myself a lot from the

1623.15 --> 1627.5800000000002
front not so much from the side this is

1625.73 --> 1633.77
almost completely deaf

1627.58 --> 1645.56
alright so how about from okay so you

1633.77 --> 1653.23
can kind of hear myself okay so that's

1645.56 --> 1655.97
what those two things mean this right so

1653.23 --> 1660.38
this is probably the opposite right

1655.97 --> 1670.64
right how's his work whoa

1660.38 --> 1673.3400000000001
okay now can just like a stereo mode

1670.64 --> 1675.5300000000002
thingy where there's clear

1673.34 --> 1684.9199999999998
distinguishment between the left side

1675.53 --> 1693.77
and the right side fine cool so this

1684.92 --> 1697.04
seems to be I don't know to me this does

1693.77 --> 1699.1399999999999
pick up the clearest details in the

1697.04 --> 1709.04
sound so if I want to play my singing

1699.14 --> 1712.0900000000001
bowl and I don't know maybe this guy's

1709.04 --> 1715.1399999999999
better for like talking and

1712.09 --> 1715.1399999999999
doing the show

1720.2 --> 1725.0800000000002
or did you like the the circle setting

1722.869 --> 1725.08
more

1728.41 --> 1742.99
or is this actually kind of good what do

1732.43 --> 1746.8300000000002
you think this be good yeah surely the

1742.99 --> 1749.47
book says yeah it has four options cool

1746.83 --> 1751.6299999999999
isn't it that's it there's no

1749.47 --> 1754.1200000000001
instruction book there's no elaborate

1751.63 --> 1756.7800000000002
details of what everything does well I

1754.12 --> 1759.1599999999999
can probably look it up on the computer

1756.78 --> 1761.8899999999999
there's an buff there's bound to be

1759.16 --> 1763.45
detailed reviews of it but I just want

1761.89 --> 1765.7800000000002
to test it out myself right here with

1763.45 --> 1765.78
you guys

1768.93 --> 1788.77
under sounds right test it under sounds

1773.32 --> 1792.57
ok damn this thing actually picks up the

1788.77 --> 1792.57
noise of my keyboard that sucks

1806.1 --> 1817.1799999999998
okay this definitely also does that all

1810.55 --> 1820.05
right well I'm not settled um what's the

1817.18 --> 1820.05
best setting here

1825.62 --> 1833.1789999999999
okay second from the right wait second

1828.559 --> 1836.299
from right that's for settings that's

1833.179 --> 1838.539
confusing you you mean the second from

1836.299 --> 1838.539
the left

1862.39 --> 1869.64
this one really okay fine do that

1873.84 --> 1884.86
alright so yeah I'm opening oh damn I'm

1881.89 --> 1890.1000000000001
kind of late actually should probably be

1884.86 --> 1892.9599999999998
rounding out the flat earther hill

1890.1 --> 1897.899
although I I want to kind of yeah let's

1892.96 --> 1897.8990000000001
see if I can get peanuts Clark in here

1915.31 --> 1922.3899999999999
all right and by the way let me in let

1917.65 --> 1925.7800000000002
ha yeah sorry for this weird the mic

1922.39 --> 1929.0800000000002
review I guess and mic testing with our

1925.78 --> 1932.8
wind but yeah there let me make a

1929.08 --> 1935.98
mention about globe busters because yeah

1932.8 --> 1938.68
everybody probably noticed that that

1935.98 --> 1942.55
suddenly close busters lost all its

1938.68 --> 1944.92
videos is like what is going on oh my

1942.55 --> 1948.1
god what they deleted that's what I

1944.92 --> 1954.73
thought but then I heard that they

1948.1 --> 1957.3999999999999
probably did an automated redo probably

1954.73 --> 1959.77
off the intro song or something due to a

1957.4 --> 1963.67
copyright issue so they were probably

1959.77 --> 1966.91
all taken down down automatically to

1963.67 --> 1967.99
replace like the song or something they

1966.91 --> 1971.6200000000001
got some issue with that

1967.99 --> 1973.5
so yeah it's probably not a panic mass

1971.62 --> 1977.35
delete which would be absolutely

1973.5 --> 1981.07
devastating to that show if that it did

1977.35 --> 1984.1299999999999
yeah underwent that so it's probably

1981.07 --> 1987.58
just a transformation process to replace

1984.13 --> 1993.4
some stuff due to copyrights and that's

1987.58 --> 1996.09
about it I hope it is that but yeah yeah

1993.4 --> 1998.92
we'll find out soon enough

1996.09 --> 2000.9299999999998
it's cuz yeah if they actually panic

1998.92 --> 2005.93
deleted at all then they're absolutely

2000.93 --> 2005.93
screwed that's man

2012.52 --> 2017.77
you know you guys are hearing a lot of

2014.35 --> 2020.98
sound out there oh maybe I'll just put

2017.77 --> 2024.84
the game down so you don't hear it this

2020.98 --> 2024.84
better just better

2030.17 --> 2036.5800000000002
oh this is not the right God make up

2033.2 --> 2036.5800000000002
your damn minds people

2042.299 --> 2049.74
okay this puts the reach down so I don't

2047.19 --> 2053.179
know if I'm still coming through

2049.74 --> 2053.1789999999996
properly or whatever

2058.82 --> 2066.139
damn sounded better before goody okay so

2063.02 --> 2068.5099999999998
and how about in this setting does that

2066.139 --> 2074.139
matter any how's the setting now how's

2068.51 --> 2074.139
the sound now it's their reach

2087.3 --> 2095.2200000000003
this is better okay then a general

2092.28 --> 2097.23
factor how about just D volume because

2095.22 --> 2099.8399999999997
yeah before with the previous shitty

2097.23 --> 2103.7400000000002
little Mike there was clear volume

2099.84 --> 2106.59
issues where my volume was just like

2103.74 --> 2109.1099999999997
very low compared to the average YouTube

2106.59 --> 2111.29
video how is my volume right now is it

2109.11 --> 2111.29
better

2117.54 --> 2122.94
awesome okay that's really good guys

2120.19 --> 2122.94
good to hear

2129.2 --> 2137.21
okay well I think on that note I'm gonna

2133.67 --> 2142.19
round this one out the flat earth

2137.21 --> 2147.14
early-bird number 118 new mics sound

2142.19 --> 2150.71
testing episode I hope you're all amused

2147.14 --> 2153.68
and I'm very glad I got this thing well

2150.71 --> 2156.28
that's a bit tinkering too yet to get

2153.68 --> 2156.2799999999997
things right

2163.85 --> 2172.52
right Dec to the heart symbol again why

2176.3 --> 2182.57
I thought this is better like is this

2179.27 --> 2185.41
better for this at this point I don't

2182.57 --> 2185.4100000000003
even know the difference

2191.74 --> 2196.93
so Rhys is this better or what's the

2194.14 --> 2199.5699999999997
other one better you tell me everybody

2196.93 --> 2206.6499999999996
vote is this better than the previous

2199.57 --> 2207.9700000000003
setting do yep post one if the other

2206.65 --> 2211.07
ones better post zero

2207.97 --> 2211.0699999999997
[Music]

2226.63 --> 2238.1800000000003
is this better or is this better you

2233.019 --> 2239.799
tell me this is better this is zero do

2238.18 --> 2243.7889999999998
you like this sound better is this more

2239.799 --> 2249.579
clear think it would be better to listen

2243.789 --> 2253.4100000000003
to or is this setting better do you like

2249.579 --> 2253.4100000000003
this setting type one

2257.64 --> 2261.3799999999997
so this is more clear anything

2266.63 --> 2273.71
zero okay so you definitely all seem to

2272.15 --> 2281.69
like this one better

2273.71 --> 2284.17
all right okay okay I'll keep it right

2281.69 --> 2284.17
here

2284.92 --> 2293.7490000000003
that typing was CGI right all right

2291.67 --> 2296.4700000000003
the funny thing is you couldn't actually

2293.749 --> 2299.39
see anything so there's not a lot of

2296.47 --> 2305.3289999999997
generated images Oh

2299.39 --> 2309.499
CGS huh you got me you got me very smart

2305.329 --> 2313.329
right so I'm the headphones I'm gonna
