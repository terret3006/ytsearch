125.2 --> 129.28
what i'm wearing

127.6 --> 133.35999999999999
right

129.28 --> 133.36
so hello cleary first in chat

134.239 --> 140.36
it is wednesday

136.0 --> 140.36
the 1st of september 2021

147.36 --> 154.31900000000002
and yeah be having a two-hour show today

150.879 --> 154.319
it's kind of busy in the house

154.48 --> 161.04
uh i think both roommates are now like

158.48 --> 161.04
around

161.599 --> 164.0
and

165.12 --> 171.04
the one right next across to me the one

168.16 --> 173.84
that i think is kind of cute is now

171.04 --> 177.0
currently yeah painting the room with

173.84 --> 177.0
her mother

184.159 --> 188.72
anyway hello dutch sailor

186.959 --> 190.08
good morning

188.72 --> 194.48
matthew hall

190.08 --> 197.48000000000002
nathan oakley 1980 good to see you all

194.48 --> 197.48
oh

205.2 --> 210.0
oh man i'm still a little bit tense but

208.239 --> 211.20000000000002
it's already

210.0 --> 214.56
getting better

211.2 --> 214.56
better than it was yesterday

215.68 --> 218.31900000000002
but yeah

219.44 --> 224.07999999999998
i think it's it's like end of summer

221.519 --> 227.36
tension type of thing and it's probably

224.08 --> 230.0
i'm not the only one because during this

227.36 --> 232.239
specific time slot in the year is when a

230.0 --> 234.799
lot of people

232.239 --> 236.48000000000002
suddenly kind of are about to start

234.799 --> 241.239
their new job

236.48 --> 241.23899999999998
their vacation is ending

241.28 --> 246.56
starting a new school thing so there is

244.48 --> 249.67999999999998
in general i think just a lot of like

246.56 --> 251.76
typical stage fright sort of

249.68 --> 255.68
tension around and i think i might be

251.76 --> 257.59999999999997
picking up on that slightly

255.68 --> 261.88
if i remember correctly i think that

257.6 --> 261.88
pretty much happens every year

274.479 --> 279.12
i have to bring a kid to a playground

276.8 --> 279.12
okay

280.479 --> 284.639
all right that's your friend's kitten

282.4 --> 284.63899999999995
right

287.199 --> 290.16
cool

288.72 --> 293.72
hey agm

290.16 --> 293.72
good to see you

299.84 --> 302.08
um

308.24 --> 314.52
right so yeah yesterday

310.639 --> 314.52
what was i doing yesterday

315.74 --> 318.92900000000003
[Music]

327.68 --> 332.08
right yet cheswick's been uploading a

329.84 --> 334.79999999999995
whole bunch of videos but he's now

332.08 --> 334.8
seeming to go

335.36 --> 341.28000000000003
and get more focused on the v situation

338.639 --> 345.72
rather than flat earth related things i

341.28 --> 345.71999999999997
hope he doesn't get himself into trouble

353.919 --> 356.15999999999997
uh

359.759 --> 364.96000000000004
because before this he's just been

361.36 --> 368.319
uploading a lot of like hilarious

364.96 --> 370.4
songs about ballers and such

368.319 --> 374.759
right uh mitchell from australia was

370.4 --> 374.75899999999996
live again too but i missed that

390.72 --> 396.24
right didn't everybody hear my

393.6 --> 399.12
r song now it was on the premiere

396.24 --> 402.479
yesterday i missed it but somebody in

399.12 --> 402.479
chat reminded me about it

402.88 --> 405.199
right

405.36 --> 410.84000000000003
hey good servant

407.36 --> 410.84000000000003
good to see you

425.599 --> 430.479
all right yeah i remember what i was

427.52 --> 432.639
doing i was watching some netflix been

430.479 --> 435.36
like kind of rounding out the

432.639 --> 439.52
night's fall series

435.36 --> 439.52000000000004
which i'm very conflicted over

439.759 --> 444.16
like yeah i can't just

444.8 --> 448.16
it's still all too fresh you have to

446.479 --> 451.039
think about what i really think about

448.16 --> 452.319
because it's really a giant mess

451.039 --> 455.31899999999996
like

452.319 --> 455.319
morally

464.16 --> 470.56
but yeah it had some very interesting

468.0 --> 472.879
parts though that yeah i still have to

470.56 --> 476.0
finish like the last episode i hope get

472.879 --> 479.44
through it's not going to be too dark

476.0 --> 481.36
white suggests to be

479.44 --> 484.24
we'll see i really didn't have the

481.36 --> 484.24
stomach for that

485.199 --> 490.40000000000003
like in the evening

487.039 --> 493.4
but yeah did watch that

490.4 --> 493.4
uh

493.759 --> 498.0
been i've been watching that series for

495.599 --> 498.0
a while

505.68 --> 509.039
i rights that was pretty much it

512.88 --> 519.36
i've been digging around a lot

516.56 --> 521.919
like through media sites just to kind of

519.36 --> 524.5600000000001
see what they're especially like

521.919 --> 525.76
concerning afghanistan just

524.56 --> 527.279
like

525.76 --> 529.36
what is being said

527.279 --> 532.8389999999999
because i'm already detecting like

529.36 --> 536.5600000000001
really different direction type of

532.839 --> 536.5600000000001
narratives going all

537.279 --> 543.56
crisscross

539.92 --> 543.56
all over the place

553.04 --> 560.36
all right uh anyway

555.76 --> 560.36
hey amanda young good to see you

567.44 --> 572.24
right so anyway yeah i'm up

570.08 --> 575.48
i'm up for whatever you guys want to

572.24 --> 575.48
talk about

578.8 --> 585.0799999999999
i had a pretty good rest

580.72 --> 585.08
i went to bed early

590.72 --> 593.9200000000001
hello tomanoide

603.12 --> 607.76
20th anniversary of 9 11.

608.64 --> 613.56
yeah that that is coming up indeed

630.399 --> 634.32
all right now remember i rounded out

632.64 --> 637.1999999999999
yesterday

634.32 --> 640.2
i'm watching lifting the veil through d

637.2 --> 640.2
live

648.88 --> 652.75
anyway

650.56 --> 654.399
new coverage in south america

652.75 --> 657.519
[Music]

654.399 --> 661.399
there is no new strain doesn't exist

657.519 --> 661.399
none of it is real

668.64 --> 675.0
yes cleary well that's because it's a

670.64 --> 675.0
completely different sort of technology

678.88 --> 684.64
yeah space rockets are very different

680.88 --> 687.2
from missiles but that's also because

684.64 --> 689.8389999999999
space rockets are manned and yeah you

687.2 --> 693.839
can't put a man on a missile rocket

689.839 --> 697.8000000000001
because they'll get absolutely crushed

693.839 --> 697.8000000000001
from the extreme acceleration

734.24 --> 739.6800000000001
land history now they're trying to tell

736.8 --> 741.519
well in south africa really well if

739.68 --> 743.76
there's going to be some kind of a new

741.519 --> 746.16
wave of sickness there it's going to be

743.76 --> 750.3199999999999
purely stress based

746.16 --> 750.3199999999999
because they they basically had

750.639 --> 756.0
pretty extreme riots everywhere

753.44 --> 760.08
and that's just a lot of stress a lot of

756.0 --> 762.16
people acting demonic and [ __ ] and

760.08 --> 765.6800000000001
[Music]

762.16 --> 768.639
yeah that's going to have literal trauma

765.68 --> 773.8389999999999
it causes trauma then especially when it

768.639 --> 773.839
comes to rest again everybody gets sick

776.639 --> 782.16
that's normal

779.279 --> 782.16
that's what happens

782.88 --> 785.6
huh

783.839 --> 788.48
i've been hearing a lot about japan and

785.6 --> 790.16
now they're really like stepping outside

788.48 --> 793.839
of the

790.16 --> 793.8389999999999
of the conventional narrative

795.839 --> 802.8800000000001
and they don't they seem to be

800.0 --> 804.88
like not directly shamed or pooh-poohed

802.88 --> 807.519
or anything they're just

804.88 --> 809.6
being left alone because of it

807.519 --> 812.079
kind of like oh don't talk about it

809.6 --> 812.839
that's something that stood out

812.079 --> 814.8
uh

812.839 --> 817.6
what

814.8 --> 817.5999999999999
south korea

818.079 --> 822.04
what are you talking about again

872.16 --> 878.3199999999999
yeah but agm dude

875.199 --> 879.68
you do realize they've literally been

878.32 --> 881.12
saying

879.68 --> 883.92
that they were

881.12 --> 886.16
that that was going to happen they even

883.92 --> 887.8389999999999
already assigned

886.16 --> 890.56
the names

887.839 --> 892.399
and that's like what is it months ago at

890.56 --> 895.199
least maybe even like

892.399 --> 897.279
a year ago or something

895.199 --> 899.279
this is all just a rolling out of models

897.279 --> 901.76
and they've already said they were gonna

899.279 --> 901.76
do that

902.639 --> 907.199
so it's like oh yeah wow they're doing

905.04 --> 908.0
exactly what they said they were gonna

907.199 --> 912.8
do

908.0 --> 916.44
how outrageous like yeah

912.8 --> 916.4399999999999
you shouldn't be surprised

926.399 --> 932.199
alphabet uh

928.639 --> 932.199
okay tomanoid

989.04 --> 992.04
hmm

996.88 --> 1000.32
right so yeah guys

1003.68 --> 1008.16
like i'm not gonna be outraged today i'm

1006.32 --> 1011.759
gonna absolutely make sure that's not

1008.16 --> 1014.48
gonna happen and trolls can try

1011.759 --> 1016.0790000000001
you know now that i've said this

1014.48 --> 1018.399
but

1016.079 --> 1020.6389999999999
yeah

1018.399 --> 1020.639
with

1021.199 --> 1025.839
my roommate over there i'm just gonna

1023.04 --> 1025.839
take it easy

1046.959 --> 1049.959
right

1057.039 --> 1061.919
one thing that kind of stood out to me

1058.96 --> 1061.919
is there's been some

1063.12 --> 1067.84
people that were like really

1065.12 --> 1070.3999999999999
the yeah was on record and all that

1067.84 --> 1071.6
they're like getting really savagely

1070.4 --> 1073.76
pissed off

1071.6 --> 1076.76
at biden like that kind of stood out to

1073.76 --> 1076.76
me

1083.84 --> 1087.84
yeah that's about it like i'm not i'm

1086.0 --> 1088.64
not even gonna pinpoint it it's just

1087.84 --> 1091.28
like

1088.64 --> 1092.3200000000002
checking out the average energy level of

1091.28 --> 1094.8799999999999
whatever

1092.32 --> 1096.1599999999999
talking point story

1094.88 --> 1100.0
right

1096.16 --> 1102.0
and yeah info wars i do keep track don't

1100.0 --> 1105.2
watch all of it sometimes it just makes

1102.0 --> 1107.52
me sick from all the fear porn

1105.2 --> 1110.0800000000002
the things i know are just propaganda

1107.52 --> 1110.08
about it

1111.2 --> 1115.28
not all of it is

1112.96 --> 1118.72
it's still information right

1115.28 --> 1120.48
like it's even like worthy to know

1118.72 --> 1123.039
what's being

1120.48 --> 1125.1200000000001
pumped out there in order for what the

1123.039 --> 1127.2
people will be reflecting on what will

1125.12 --> 1129.36
be the things that they might think of

1127.2 --> 1132.0800000000002
and hold on to right

1129.36 --> 1134.4799999999998
that's why it's for important to me

1132.08 --> 1136.8799999999999
to keep track of everything whatever i

1134.48 --> 1138.4
feel about it

1136.88 --> 1142.24
however much

1138.4 --> 1142.24
level of truth i think it has

1147.039 --> 1152.72
hello dusty writer

1150.32 --> 1154.96
but yeah it did stand out to me like

1152.72 --> 1154.96
just

1156.72 --> 1162.4
was this lady on really savagely angry

1159.52 --> 1164.72
against biden for

1162.4 --> 1167.2
just yeah the afghanistan situation it

1164.72 --> 1171.3600000000001
seems to make a couple of people really

1167.2 --> 1173.1200000000001
personally pissed off and they like lost

1171.36 --> 1175.84
people because of it

1173.12 --> 1178.32
and the more i look into just side

1175.84 --> 1182.48
stories of everything related to it it

1178.32 --> 1185.6789999999999
is really like a maximum

1182.48 --> 1188.799
disaster just in so many little details

1185.679 --> 1189.76
were done so catastrophically bad it's

1188.799 --> 1191.76
almost

1189.76 --> 1195.76
well it's not even you can't even say

1191.76 --> 1198.0
almost anymore it's just pretty certain

1195.76 --> 1201.12
that they did it on purpose that they

1198.0 --> 1202.32
made the maximum possible humiliating

1201.12 --> 1204.7199999999998
disaster

1202.32 --> 1207.72
out of it when it was completely

1204.72 --> 1207.72
unnecessary

1214.01 --> 1220.039
[Music]

1217.039 --> 1220.039
right

1223.6 --> 1231.1999999999998
i also think though there are i'm not

1226.64 --> 1231.2
sure a hundred percent but just from

1232.159 --> 1236.7990000000002
from superficial things coming out of

1234.4 --> 1239.1200000000001
there talking points

1236.799 --> 1241.76
articles you know articles these days

1239.12 --> 1244.1589999999999
are very treacherous they have been for

1241.76 --> 1246.24
a while but like in these 10 situations

1244.159 --> 1248.5590000000002
they become even more treacherous

1246.24 --> 1251.52
because there's just pretty certain

1248.559 --> 1252.8799999999999
there's just blatantly

1251.52 --> 1257.52
fake

1252.88 --> 1261.24
things that are suggested to happen also

1257.52 --> 1261.24
blatantly fake

1262.4 --> 1266.799
like really to make well the taliban

1265.2 --> 1270.159
look like just

1266.799 --> 1270.1589999999999
absolute savages

1270.24 --> 1274.24
right and hey they're not perfect they

1272.159 --> 1278.7990000000002
have their own code of conduct it's very

1274.24 --> 1281.52
unwestern in many ways etc but

1278.799 --> 1283.36
i just feel they are just being

1281.52 --> 1286.1589999999999
portrayed

1283.36 --> 1288.3999999999999
like irrationally

1286.159 --> 1290.88
and

1288.4 --> 1293.6000000000001
and other people like lift the veil also

1290.88 --> 1295.919
has taken out i heard that yesterday

1293.6 --> 1298.08
he said it by himself didn't like ask i

1295.919 --> 1300.0800000000002
didn't ask him or anything and he said

1298.08 --> 1302.1589999999999
like yeah no no there's really not

1300.08 --> 1303.6
coming that much

1302.159 --> 1306.72
out of

1303.6 --> 1308.8799999999999
there's not any much real like victim

1306.72 --> 1309.919
cases like they're not brutalizing

1308.88 --> 1310.7990000000002
people

1309.919 --> 1312.7990000000002
like

1310.799 --> 1316.039
a lot of the media

1312.799 --> 1316.039
is suggesting

1318.08 --> 1322.1589999999999
so i'm glad i'm not the only one that's

1320.32 --> 1325.039
actually thinking that

1322.159 --> 1328.3600000000001
he is a walker what are you talking

1325.039 --> 1328.36
about cleary

1336.69 --> 1341.039
[Music]

1338.159 --> 1343.3600000000001
can't see biden ever lasting another

1341.039 --> 1347.72
year well they're certainly pushing

1343.36 --> 1347.7199999999998
towards exiting him

1350.08 --> 1353.84
but

1350.96 --> 1356.4
to be fair i was pretty certain i even

1353.84 --> 1356.3999999999999
called it

1356.72 --> 1359.679
at the start

1358.32 --> 1363.28
that

1359.679 --> 1365.44
that it was like he is a fall guy

1363.28 --> 1367.76
in the bigger plan right in the bigger

1365.44 --> 1367.76
scheme

1367.84 --> 1370.08
of things

1368.73 --> 1372.48
[Music]

1370.08 --> 1374.559
he is supposed to mock up

1372.48 --> 1377.28
to kind of like

1374.559 --> 1378.72
be the fall guy give him all the blame

1377.28 --> 1383.039
and then

1378.72 --> 1385.3600000000001
move on with a virtual fresh start

1383.039 --> 1387.2
right because there was there were

1385.36 --> 1390.6399999999999
things good there are issues like right

1387.2 --> 1392.88
right down the road

1390.64 --> 1392.88
and

1393.52 --> 1396.72
yeah that was always there was always

1395.6 --> 1398.9599999999998
something

1396.72 --> 1400.4
gonna happen some things were gonna

1398.96 --> 1404.0
happen and there's still like the

1400.4 --> 1404.0
financial issue overall

1406.64 --> 1409.44
with america

1410.88 --> 1417.0800000000002
they're setting up another night maybe

1414.08 --> 1417.08
maybe

1427.919 --> 1433.5590000000002
i'd also been hearing but yeah

1444.559 --> 1450.0
still close allies with al qaeda like al

1447.84 --> 1453.6
qaeda isn't

1450.0 --> 1453.6
like that's secret service

1456.799 --> 1464.2
al-qaeda is cia practically

1459.76 --> 1464.2
it always was it's called the list

1473.12 --> 1476.6399999999999
it's all this nonsense oh taliban oh

1475.279 --> 1479.12
they're allies with their credit oh

1476.64 --> 1480.4
their isis oh really

1479.12 --> 1483.1999999999998
or

1480.4 --> 1486.3200000000002
they just want their country back

1483.2 --> 1488.24
and that's it and they just want

1486.32 --> 1490.559
what they perceive as the foreign

1488.24 --> 1493.1200000000001
invaders and they're kind of right to

1490.559 --> 1493.12
get out

1493.919 --> 1496.919
right

1503.6 --> 1506.7199999999998
i watch zero news ugh all right well

1505.76 --> 1510.48
that's

1506.72 --> 1510.48
very disciplined of you clearly

1512.64 --> 1518.48
but i don't blame you

1515.36 --> 1518.4799999999998
in this time period

1521.52 --> 1526.52
hello rob h by the way let's see you

1536.64 --> 1540.5590000000002
but yeah talking about like disaster

1539.36 --> 1542.8799999999999
detail

1540.559 --> 1546.6399999999999
did you know that basically the taliban

1542.88 --> 1549.919
leadership like officially offered biden

1546.64 --> 1553.3600000000001
to keep kabul

1549.919 --> 1553.3600000000001
and he just declined

1554.96 --> 1560.24
had you heard that one

1557.679 --> 1560.24
like what

1566.96 --> 1569.279
all right

1569.679 --> 1573.3600000000001
so

1570.64 --> 1576.5590000000002
the whole situation it just smells not

1573.36 --> 1580.24
like a false flag it smells like a

1576.559 --> 1580.24
a controlled mock-up

1581.279 --> 1585.279
because

1582.4 --> 1588.4
the whole evacuation situation could

1585.279 --> 1590.799
have gone much much smoother without any

1588.4 --> 1590.799
issue

1591.44 --> 1595.76
without a single wounded

1593.52 --> 1598.48
if they'd just

1595.76 --> 1599.6
done and prepared things in time and it

1598.48 --> 1601.44
was all

1599.6 --> 1603.12
not done

1601.44 --> 1606.48
they just didn't do anything they just

1603.12 --> 1606.4799999999998
left everything as it is

1611.039 --> 1616.799
right so controlled mock-up that's what

1613.039 --> 1616.799
i think it is the situation

1618.32 --> 1622.36
is starting 80 12.

1637.52 --> 1640.96
right but it might get it might be turn

1640.24 --> 1644.48
out

1640.96 --> 1646.3990000000001
this would be really in that

1644.48 --> 1648.96
in their methods

1646.399 --> 1651.279
what might happen is just like oh

1648.96 --> 1654.24
we got to go back somehow and then

1651.279 --> 1655.84
they like take back kabul and it's like

1654.24 --> 1658.24
oh we're gonna take it back from the

1655.84 --> 1659.84
taliban and the taliban's just gonna oh

1658.24 --> 1661.44
so you're finally gonna take the offer

1659.84 --> 1662.559
you're just gonna take a bull then okay

1661.44 --> 1664.72
we'll leave

1662.559 --> 1667.6
and then building is yes we've run the

1664.72 --> 1668.559
victory over to televan we conquered

1667.6 --> 1670.559
kabul

1668.559 --> 1672.24
without a single wounded soldier yeah

1670.559 --> 1674.8799999999999
that's because they literally gave it to

1672.24 --> 1676.72
you like was kind of the original deal

1674.88 --> 1679.44
right

1676.72 --> 1681.679
there's an armenian prediction

1679.44 --> 1684.3990000000001
who wants to bet with me that it's gonna

1681.679 --> 1686.72
happen exactly like that

1684.399 --> 1686.7199999999998
huh

1687.36 --> 1691.08
can you feel it

1698.32 --> 1701.6789999999999
mission accomplished right

1702.96 --> 1709.96
but you know they would do you know they

1705.919 --> 1709.96
would go there right

1718.32 --> 1721.72
hey aries

1725.52 --> 1729.9189999999999
i bet they don't go back well yeah that

1727.44 --> 1731.679
might happen too but if they do it's

1729.919 --> 1735.24
probably going to be something really

1731.679 --> 1735.24
silly like that

1742.88 --> 1749.44
because they just want these

1745.919 --> 1751.919
virtual military victories

1749.44 --> 1754.799
through media suggestion right it seems

1751.919 --> 1758.64
like america is just so eager to create

1754.799 --> 1760.32
these virtual military victories

1758.64 --> 1762.64
and they'll trick everyone and

1760.32 --> 1765.8799999999999
everything to kind of make

1762.64 --> 1765.88
it happen

1772.0 --> 1776.399
but in reality it's just everybody

1774.0 --> 1780.64
that's paying half a lick of attention

1776.399 --> 1782.8799999999999
just can see that it's just all nonsense

1780.64 --> 1785.76
and that's just bumbling and fumbling

1782.88 --> 1785.7600000000002
around really

1786.159 --> 1793.0800000000002
with only the media to paint a nice

1789.279 --> 1793.08
picture about it

1808.08 --> 1814.96
okay agm

1810.559 --> 1814.96
yeah i heard it too i heard it that

1815.12 --> 1823.36
the it might be in the in the dark gears

1820.08 --> 1824.399
it might be arriving soon

1823.36 --> 1826.8799999999999
that

1824.399 --> 1828.6399999999999
once they might just

1826.88 --> 1829.8000000000002
switch

1828.64 --> 1830.88
the system from

1829.8 --> 1832.8799999999999
[Music]

1830.88 --> 1835.7600000000002
sea

1832.88 --> 1838.24
related directly to climate change

1835.76 --> 1838.24
related

1838.72 --> 1845.679
from one sea to another or rather

1842.08 --> 1846.6399999999999
from one sea to two seas how about that

1845.679 --> 1850.1200000000001
right

1846.64 --> 1850.1200000000001
climate change

1851.84 --> 1856.48
that they want to just kind of switch

1854.24 --> 1858.88
the railroad of the narrative just like

1856.48 --> 1861.6
oh yeah now we're going to do all these

1858.88 --> 1864.3990000000001
same things for climate change

1861.6 --> 1866.6399999999999
right it probably including

1864.399 --> 1869.5189999999998
these

1866.64 --> 1870.96
for completely irrational like

1869.519 --> 1873.279
like

1870.96 --> 1876.799
without even a proper cover story from

1873.279 --> 1879.519
it it's it's no you just got to take it

1876.799 --> 1881.9189999999999
forward

1879.519 --> 1883.2
against overpopulation and if you

1881.919 --> 1886.0800000000002
somehow

1883.2 --> 1889.919
do that then yeah

1886.08 --> 1893.399
it can't get more like a cult

1889.919 --> 1893.3990000000001
crazy stuff

1905.84 --> 1910.48
yeah dumb jazza well you know what i

1907.76 --> 1910.48
feel about it

1910.72 --> 1914.64
it's been like that for a while

1913.36 --> 1918.0
like

1914.64 --> 1920.3990000000001
what they're doing with the taliban

1918.0 --> 1922.88
is kind of

1920.399 --> 1925.76
they're like secret cult

1922.88 --> 1928.0
war partners

1925.76 --> 1932.559
right they're not really friends

1928.0 --> 1932.559
but they will work together in schemes

1933.44 --> 1936.559
what do you think about that

1947.039 --> 1952.48
and also with that like

1949.36 --> 1955.84
it's like okay we're working together

1952.48 --> 1957.44
very feudal by the way working together

1955.84 --> 1960.0
practically

1957.44 --> 1962.3990000000001
but then still at the speaking points

1960.0 --> 1965.84
enemy enemy enemy enemy well that's

1962.399 --> 1968.4799999999998
typical for for that entire setup right

1965.84 --> 1970.6399999999999
that's a lot of what happened even

1968.48 --> 1973.039
between soviet russia and the united

1970.64 --> 1973.039
states

1973.36 --> 1977.9189999999999
while they still worked together with

1975.679 --> 1982.3600000000001
space stuff

1977.919 --> 1982.3600000000001
here and there it's really weird

1994.08 --> 1999.4399999999998
they were together for mutual benefit

1996.159 --> 1999.44
like against russian

1999.679 --> 2003.72
well back then they were

2008.559 --> 2013.12
it's ironic though because it's already

2010.64 --> 2015.039
signs that russia is gonna get involved

2013.12 --> 2016.6399999999999
again

2015.039 --> 2019.919
now that

2016.64 --> 2021.679
yeah america and europe is all rich is

2019.919 --> 2023.2
all

2021.679 --> 2025.919
retreating

2023.2 --> 2030.3990000000001
so leaving

2025.919 --> 2031.519
been seeing a lot of that on rush rt

2030.399 --> 2033.6
so

2031.519 --> 2034.32
like they're not just like oh let's send

2033.6 --> 2037.76
the

2034.32 --> 2041.36
troops to occupy but they are like

2037.76 --> 2042.8799999999999
like just scanning [ __ ] likes

2041.36 --> 2045.9189999999999
they're trying to keep order at a

2042.88 --> 2048.96
distance and well russians have like

2045.919 --> 2048.96
they're pretty good at it

2049.679 --> 2055.28
i've been very good at it with syria too

2053.839 --> 2057.919
so

2055.28 --> 2061.3990000000003
but it is just like the irony is insane

2057.919 --> 2061.399
of all of it

2074.96 --> 2079.359
yeah russian invasion of afghanistan

2077.04 --> 2084.32
yeah but that was like

2079.359 --> 2084.3199999999997
pretty much like peak soviet time right

2086.48 --> 2091.919
was it p well it yeah it was still very

2089.839 --> 2094.32
much soviet during that time it's

2091.919 --> 2097.04
different now

2094.32 --> 2099.119
well the taliban will launch a moon

2097.04 --> 2103.56
mission

2099.119 --> 2103.56
oh my god that's so funny

2104.72 --> 2110.0789999999997
dude if they get really trollish they

2107.599 --> 2115.2000000000003
might just

2110.079 --> 2117.6800000000003
make a faked video about it just to mock

2115.2 --> 2118.7999999999997
the americans or something

2117.68 --> 2119.9199999999996
just

2118.8 --> 2122.2400000000002
right

2119.92 --> 2125.359
because how difficult is that nowadays

2122.24 --> 2127.9199999999996
with the quality of cgi

2125.359 --> 2130.96
like they could just

2127.92 --> 2134.32
like make a really goofy green screen

2130.96 --> 2135.28
style video like as if they were doing

2134.32 --> 2138.56
that

2135.28 --> 2140.6400000000003
just to [ __ ] around

2138.56 --> 2142.72
i have to say if they would do that i

2140.64 --> 2145.5989999999997
would laugh my ass off

2142.72 --> 2147.68
very weird but

2145.599 --> 2151.119
it would be really funny

2147.68 --> 2154.24
i've already seen like memes of people

2151.119 --> 2156.48
not taliban people but just like

2154.24 --> 2158.3999999999996
still shots and [ __ ] where they edit it

2156.48 --> 2160.8
together already suggesting something

2158.4 --> 2163.359
like that so i've already seen a couple

2160.8 --> 2165.04
of those types of memes

2163.359 --> 2168.2
but i don't think they're coming from

2165.04 --> 2168.2
the taliban

2172.4 --> 2175.2000000000003
material

2175.52 --> 2181.7599999999998
u.s left enough material for a moon

2177.76 --> 2181.76
mission that's hilarious them jazza

2182.24 --> 2187.839
hey mr cheswick

2184.88 --> 2187.839
dude

2188.4 --> 2192.7200000000003
you have had some really awesome songs

2190.8 --> 2194.1600000000003
recently

2192.72 --> 2196.3999999999996
you got to be a little bit careful

2194.16 --> 2197.92
though with your video uploads from

2196.4 --> 2199.839
yesterday

2197.92 --> 2202.2400000000002
because they might get you a strike or

2199.839 --> 2202.24
something

2205.92 --> 2211.079
anyway

2207.2 --> 2211.0789999999997
great to have you here in chat

2215.91 --> 2219.0499999999997
[Music]

2237.28 --> 2240.96
what

2238.56 --> 2243.839
what is cccp

2240.96 --> 2243.839
agm

2258.079 --> 2262.5600000000004
yes clear i saw

2260.0 --> 2266.64
i saw the picture i actually

2262.56 --> 2266.64
showed it on yesterday's show

2268.56 --> 2271.839
it could have been worse

2294.72 --> 2297.72
hmm

2313.92 --> 2319.64
oh okay didn't know that

2316.4 --> 2319.64
was him

2334.96 --> 2339.68
yeah that doesn't really

2336.96 --> 2342.56
match though union

2339.68 --> 2347.44
of soviet socialist republics i don't

2342.56 --> 2347.44
see how that is cccp but fine

2350.56 --> 2355.16
if that's what it really stands for

2364.96 --> 2369.2
oh

2366.96 --> 2373.359
what a tony whitcomb

2369.2 --> 2375.2
pat bassin you mean pat britton

2373.359 --> 2378.4
the guy who wants to have nathan and

2375.2 --> 2382.0
conspiracy cats on his shitty supposed

2378.4 --> 2386.2000000000003
neutral platform yeah

2382.0 --> 2386.2
yeah nathan's not gonna do that

2432.16 --> 2436.5989999999997
yeah andrew we know

2460.96 --> 2465.839
right thanks sonny whitcomb

2462.96 --> 2468.8
yeah yes the show was

2465.839 --> 2468.7999999999997
didn't watch it back

2472.56 --> 2477.2799999999997
yes mr jesswick no i don't have plan

2475.44 --> 2479.04
anything special it's just gonna be the

2477.28 --> 2481.2000000000003
thousandth episode

2479.04 --> 2484.599
maybe i'll have somebody on

2481.2 --> 2484.5989999999997
i'm not sure

2494.88 --> 2500.8
see really what what is that jimmy j

2497.68 --> 2500.7999999999997
what is cyrillic

2506.96 --> 2511.28
have a few beers

2509.04 --> 2513.2799999999997
well not during the live show don't do

2511.28 --> 2515.2000000000003
that especially during this time slot

2513.28 --> 2518.1600000000003
come on

2515.2 --> 2518.16
that's just wrong

2519.52 --> 2524.079
oh right the

2521.359 --> 2527.68
what i call the lush the russian letter

2524.079 --> 2530.319
type it's not it's like

2527.68 --> 2530.319
eastern

2532.8 --> 2536.8
in between

2534.24 --> 2539.04
asia and europe

2536.8 --> 2539.04
right

2540.16 --> 2544.0789999999997
okay that's

2542.24 --> 2546.0789999999997
cyrillic

2544.079 --> 2547.8390000000004
i don't know why i never knew it was

2546.079 --> 2551.4
called that

2547.839 --> 2551.4
i hope i'll remember

2592.4 --> 2599.2000000000003
have somebody on to tell us it's a globe

2596.4 --> 2599.2000000000003
oh goody

2600.0 --> 2603.04
nah

2601.28 --> 2606.079
i think it's probably going to be really

2603.04 --> 2608.079
boring tomorrow if i know myself

2606.079 --> 2610.8
because i'll just be trying to suppress

2608.079 --> 2610.8
the tension

2611.119 --> 2617.76
it's like on my birthdays

2613.28 --> 2617.76
when it it's really taken notice off

2618.079 --> 2624.4
i tend to get like really just like no

2621.04 --> 2626.48
i'm just gonna calm down and that makes

2624.4 --> 2629.119
the thing usually kind of boring because

2626.48 --> 2631.04
i'm just trying to stay calm

2629.119 --> 2633.52
so i don't know if tomorrow's gonna be

2631.04 --> 2635.44
really special maybe like if nobody's

2633.52 --> 2637.839
home i'll just

2635.44 --> 2641.839
choose to

2637.839 --> 2643.599
open up the arwenian volume

2641.839 --> 2647.88
whatever but yeah that's not gonna

2643.599 --> 2647.88
happen today at least so

2655.76 --> 2662.3190000000004
i i don't know tony whitcomb why i would

2658.64 --> 2665.319
want to have a glober on my show though

2662.319 --> 2665.319
why

2678.0 --> 2683.56
miss the pun

2680.319 --> 2683.56
what one

2714.88 --> 2718.2000000000003
hold on

2754.56 --> 2758.44
right sorry about that

2761.2 --> 2765.839
oh having someone on oh

2763.599 --> 2767.3590000000004
right yeah i didn't see that one okay

2765.839 --> 2771.04
that's kind of clever

2767.359 --> 2771.04
i i didn't see it you're right

2773.119 --> 2780.28
hmm

2775.68 --> 2780.2799999999997
hey julio pavin good to see you

2798.8 --> 2803.8390000000004
well i almost would think it would be

2800.72 --> 2803.839
kind of funny if i

2804.24 --> 2809.5989999999997
but it is it really funny though i'm not

2806.72 --> 2811.2
sure but it's funny as a situation maybe

2809.599 --> 2815.839
not as an act

2811.2 --> 2818.0789999999997
to like have a really unsuspecting

2815.839 --> 2820.64
like that really

2818.079 --> 2823.3590000000004
has never really looked into

2820.64 --> 2825.7599999999998
flat earth makes them a little giggly

2823.359 --> 2829.7599999999998
and then basically try to explain to

2825.76 --> 2831.44
them it would be handy if they had some

2829.76 --> 2834.4
like

2831.44 --> 2836.96
capability to deal with math and physics

2834.4 --> 2839.599
just naturally but never really got into

2836.96 --> 2842.079
it and i just explained to them about

2839.599 --> 2843.599
spatial non-linearity

2842.079 --> 2844.7200000000003
and the looping

2843.599 --> 2846.559
realm

2844.72 --> 2848.8799999999997
and the holographic nature of the

2846.559 --> 2850.1600000000003
heavenly lights like if i would just

2848.88 --> 2852.7200000000003
explain that

2850.16 --> 2855.92
they'd probably like

2852.72 --> 2855.9199999999996
what the [ __ ]

2856.8 --> 2861.6800000000003
that would be kind of funny

2859.76 --> 2863.28
but not something you should do on a

2861.68 --> 2864.8799999999997
regular basis

2863.28 --> 2868.079
or i should do i don't know if any of

2864.88 --> 2868.079
you can't even do that

2871.359 --> 2876.0789999999997
i think i'll probably use it to kind of

2873.599 --> 2878.88
br try to brag with my intelligence to

2876.079 --> 2878.88
girls though

2884.839 --> 2890.0789999999997
right i've already basically explained

2887.92 --> 2893.76
to the mother my roommate

2890.079 --> 2893.76
that i'm into physics

2895.599 --> 2899.52
so

2896.8 --> 2902.4
yeah that definitely does kind of fall

2899.52 --> 2902.4
down that lane

2905.68 --> 2911.359
or rather like theoretical physics

2908.8 --> 2915.7200000000003
which is kind of a colloquialization of

2911.359 --> 2915.72
the word it's kind of weird but

2920.24 --> 2924.72
what projection is your looping realm

2922.96 --> 2927.7200000000003
based on

2924.72 --> 2927.72
what

2931.359 --> 2936.5589999999997
uh

2932.96 --> 2936.559
well the rectangular one

2941.359 --> 2945.7599999999998
that that's the original it's just

2943.2 --> 2948.0
rectangular looping that's

2945.76 --> 2951.599
that would be the most basic form and

2948.0 --> 2951.599
the most easy to explain

2951.839 --> 2957.2
right but i've already conceded it could

2954.16 --> 2959.359
be much more complex and very irregular

2957.2 --> 2962.24
looping and all that which would make it

2959.359 --> 2964.4
just unbelievably confusing to people

2962.24 --> 2964.3999999999996
that

2964.559 --> 2968.2400000000002
don't really know how to think beyond

2966.88 --> 2971.839
normal

2968.24 --> 2971.839
euclidean space

2998.64 --> 3004.0789999999997
right but yeah the projection i'll show

3001.92 --> 3004.079
it

3004.319 --> 3007.8
show the pictures

3008.12 --> 3011.3199999999997
[Music]

3014.4 --> 3020.4
i mean

3016.0 --> 3020.4
the map that i would currently forward

3020.8 --> 3027.8
which is still not absolutely accurate

3024.4 --> 3027.8
and the scale

3027.839 --> 3032.64
but i wouldn't just

3029.76 --> 3034.7200000000003
roughly say it it's coming closest to a

3032.64 --> 3036.0
conception of a rectangular looping

3034.72 --> 3038.0789999999997
system

3036.0 --> 3041.359
if if it was

3038.079 --> 3044.079
looping in a linear fashion at least

3041.359 --> 3044.0789999999997
and that would be

3044.4 --> 3047.7200000000003
this one

3060.96 --> 3065.88
right

3062.64 --> 3065.8799999999997
and then

3070.559 --> 3073.6800000000003
this would be a

3074.72 --> 3080.0789999999997
slanted

3077.44 --> 3083.4
view on it

3080.079 --> 3083.4
this picture

3084.079 --> 3090.079
and it's also what i use is one of the

3086.48 --> 3091.68
early bird show thumbnails

3090.079 --> 3094.6800000000003
so that's where you might recognize it

3091.68 --> 3094.68
from

3096.48 --> 3100.839
and this is still not the scale

3136.64 --> 3141.16
what are you talking about agm

3168.16 --> 3173.839
all right yes i know iron 26 well i

3170.4 --> 3177.44
never claimed that the layout

3173.839 --> 3180.48
of the land masses in that map

3177.44 --> 3183.68
representation are accurate as i already

3180.48 --> 3183.68
said it's not the scale

3183.92 --> 3191.119
i don't know exactly how it is divided

3188.48 --> 3194.2400000000002
i just know that on the globe projection

3191.119 --> 3197.2400000000002
it's not the scale either

3194.24 --> 3197.24
so

3211.76 --> 3214.76
yep

3245.68 --> 3249.52
what do i make of

3247.559 --> 3254.3190000000004
fpv's map

3249.52 --> 3254.319
i don't what is fpv's map

3257.04 --> 3260.44
what is that

3266.96 --> 3271.839
they keep bringing up southern star

3268.88 --> 3275.2000000000003
rotation yet it's

3271.839 --> 3277.04
it's hopelessly presuppositional

3275.2 --> 3278.48
everything about it is hopelessly

3277.04 --> 3281.2
presuppositional

3278.48 --> 3283.68
they just cannot concede that

3281.2 --> 3285.7599999999998
the heavenly lights are not euclidean

3283.68 --> 3288.64
they are not anywhere they are not

3285.76 --> 3290.96
literally hovering over the flat

3288.64 --> 3292.799
disk

3290.96 --> 3294.88
including the sun and the moon they're

3292.799 --> 3297.599
just at an angular relation to the

3294.88 --> 3300.6400000000003
observer and yeah it just happens to be

3297.599 --> 3301.839
an apparent demisphere

3300.64 --> 3303.839
yeah

3301.839 --> 3305.839
it's really cute it doesn't prove

3303.839 --> 3308.64
anything about the orientation of the

3305.839 --> 3308.64
land masses

3312.96 --> 3317.88
and it especially doesn't prove

3314.88 --> 3317.88
curvature

3326.24 --> 3331.7599999999998
i see the rectangular part

3328.799 --> 3334.48
can you explain the looping part okay

3331.76 --> 3336.079
do it again

3334.48 --> 3336.96
right

3336.079 --> 3339.599
well

3336.96 --> 3341.44
if it wasn't looping

3339.599 --> 3346.0
that would mean that

3341.44 --> 3346.0
the ends of the rectangle would be

3346.16 --> 3352.3999999999996
dome touchdown barriers right

3350.48 --> 3355.839
well what if there wasn't a barrier

3352.4 --> 3360.6800000000003
there what if it just interconnected

3355.839 --> 3360.68
go that way you end up that way

3362.16 --> 3365.68
that's looping

3363.839 --> 3368.48
looping is just the spatial

3365.68 --> 3371.04
interconnection

3368.48 --> 3374.16
a loop within the realm and the loop

3371.04 --> 3376.24
crosses the entire section

3374.16 --> 3379.2
there isn't a place where you can

3376.24 --> 3382.24
pinpoint down oh here is the portal

3379.2 --> 3385.359
here is the barrier no it's just looping

3382.24 --> 3387.4399999999996
all of it is looping

3385.359 --> 3390.0789999999997
doesn't matter where you're at it's

3387.44 --> 3392.16
always looping

3390.079 --> 3396.3590000000004
from one side to the other

3392.16 --> 3396.359
direct spatial interconnection

3410.64 --> 3417.48
what

3412.64 --> 3417.48
what are you talking about jason brown

3426.0 --> 3432.28
oh wait yeah those things are called

3428.559 --> 3432.28
mobiles right

3435.119 --> 3441.04
oh it certainly is part of the

3437.04 --> 3441.04
mechanical envisioning

3441.599 --> 3447.52
right having mobiles with planets and

3444.4 --> 3449.28
stars and spaceships and all that

3447.52 --> 3451.839
hanging over a crib

3449.28 --> 3454.96
is going to

3451.839 --> 3457.359
already kind of railroad just that

3454.96 --> 3459.44
that pattern of thinking

3457.359 --> 3461.52
it's going to make you comfortable with

3459.44 --> 3463.76
envisioning that

3461.52 --> 3467.119
so it is kind of like preconditioning to

3463.76 --> 3467.119
heliocentric thinking

3472.839 --> 3478.5589999999997
indeed circles are loops no no circles

3476.96 --> 3481.52
are circles

3478.559 --> 3481.52
a loop is a loop

3482.079 --> 3486.4
a circle is euclidean a

3486.839 --> 3493.599
loop yeah that it doesn't fit

3490.24 --> 3495.4399999999996
euclidean that's the point

3493.599 --> 3497.119
well yeah

3495.44 --> 3498.96
no

3497.119 --> 3502.4
a loop is

3498.96 --> 3505.2
not about things within the space

3502.4 --> 3508.079
it's about the space itself

3505.2 --> 3508.0789999999997
that's the difference

3510.16 --> 3517.319
so a circle can exist within a spatial

3514.319 --> 3517.319
confine

3518.319 --> 3523.119
a loop

3520.559 --> 3527.0
is about how the spatial confine

3523.119 --> 3527.0
connects in on itself

3531.68 --> 3537.359
so i would yeah

3533.359 --> 3538.96
like theoretically or mathematically

3537.359 --> 3542.24
considered

3538.96 --> 3545.839
circles could be seen as loops right but

3542.24 --> 3545.839
they're not though

3552.64 --> 3558.8799999999997
oh a loop oh good goody right

3556.559 --> 3561.3590000000004
oh yeah you're trying to trick me with

3558.88 --> 3561.359
the word

3563.68 --> 3568.319
let's just say circles are not looping

3566.319 --> 3572.04
not spatially looping

3568.319 --> 3572.04
it's just the shape

3589.44 --> 3593.839
why would you say that because we were

3591.359 --> 3595.2
not talking about that i wasn't talking

3593.839 --> 3597.2799999999997
about that

3595.2 --> 3600.8799999999997
use of the word loop i'm not talking

3597.28 --> 3602.88
about an object called a loop

3600.88 --> 3606.799
i'm talking about spatial looping that

3602.88 --> 3606.799
was that was the subject

3610.559 --> 3614.2000000000003
not about geometries

3628.64 --> 3635.68
the looper movie was good was it i

3632.16 --> 3635.68
guess it was interesting

3635.839 --> 3640.0789999999997
although it had nothing to do with

3637.44 --> 3642.4
special looping at all it's just time

3640.079 --> 3645.6800000000003
looping right because oh science fiction

3642.4 --> 3647.04
has definitely allowed everybody to

3645.68 --> 3651.2
figure out

3647.04 --> 3653.44
time loops time travel related thingies

3651.2 --> 3656.3999999999996
right loops

3653.44 --> 3658.079
oh there's a loop within the time thing

3656.4 --> 3660.559
yeah that's not what we're talking about

3658.079 --> 3660.559
at all

3662.16 --> 3668.5589999999997
not talking about time loop i'm talking

3664.319 --> 3672.16
about space show loop a loop in space

3668.559 --> 3675.52
not a physical object called a loop

3672.16 --> 3677.359
not a geometric aspect of a shape

3675.52 --> 3681.2
but the literal

3677.359 --> 3683.68
direct looping interconnection of space

3681.2 --> 3685.9199999999996
itself volume

3683.68 --> 3687.5989999999997
not outer space the volume

3685.92 --> 3690.0
interconnection

3687.599 --> 3693.96
with itself

3690.0 --> 3693.96
that's what i'm talking about

3702.72 --> 3706.0
why suspect trick

3706.16 --> 3708.96
because it is

3711.04 --> 3716.04
and i just explained exactly why

3755.2 --> 3758.839
hey captain caveman

3783.119 --> 3790.48
the jumper what the hell

3786.72 --> 3791.68
oh you were not talking about loopers

3790.48 --> 3794.079
okay

3791.68 --> 3797.0789999999997
i have no idea what that movie is but

3794.079 --> 3797.079
whatever

3839.839 --> 3844.0
what are you

3841.44 --> 3846.2400000000002
talking about

3844.0 --> 3849.24
that's not a coherent sentence captain

3846.24 --> 3849.24
caveman

3885.599 --> 3890.1600000000003
oh wait you're talking about blue marble

3887.68 --> 3893.2799999999997
science

3890.16 --> 3894.72
like it's like a blue marble mirror what

3893.28 --> 3898.6400000000003
the hell

3894.72 --> 3901.52
you know okay so he mirrored

3898.64 --> 3904.52
i don't even know what satanic symbolism

3901.52 --> 3904.52
is

3934.799 --> 3940.03
uh

3936.9 --> 3940.03
[Music]

3944.05 --> 3948.799
[Music]

3945.76 --> 3951.8390000000004
mirrored blue marble what are you

3948.799 --> 3954.839
talking about captain caveman for [ __ ]

3951.839 --> 3954.839
sake

3972.319 --> 3977.4
why will you never drink tonic again

3974.16 --> 3977.3999999999996
good servant

3996.72 --> 4002.64
the ability to manipulate the loop ends

4000.319 --> 4002.64
what

4003.119 --> 4006.44
the [ __ ]

4007.119 --> 4009.359
no

4009.599 --> 4013.92
no that that wouldn't happen at all

4017.599 --> 4022.6400000000003
unless it's again

4019.68 --> 4026.16
a space time loop

4022.64 --> 4027.44
time travel wormhole all that sci-fi

4026.16 --> 4029.52
stuff right

4027.44 --> 4030.799
yeah that's not what spatial looping is

4029.52 --> 4032.559
about at all

4030.799 --> 4035.0389999999998
if you manipulate it all that would

4032.559 --> 4037.6800000000003
happen is that literally

4035.039 --> 4039.3590000000004
the total available volume would just

4037.68 --> 4041.7599999999998
dis decrease

4039.359 --> 4045.359
in the sense it would literally phase

4041.76 --> 4047.44
out of available space

4045.359 --> 4049.2799999999997
yeah

4047.44 --> 4051.359
okay imagine

4049.28 --> 4053.3590000000004
it's like a region

4051.359 --> 4056.4
and there's like islands there and stuff

4053.359 --> 4059.0389999999998
and then suddenly it's like

4056.4 --> 4059.039
it's gone

4059.44 --> 4064.319
i mean it's not

4061.76 --> 4067.039
it still physically exists just not

4064.319 --> 4068.24
within the available volume

4067.039 --> 4069.599
yeah

4068.24 --> 4071.52
how about that

4069.599 --> 4074.2400000000002
that's if the spatial loop was

4071.52 --> 4077.839
manipulated you don't teleport it has

4074.24 --> 4077.839
nothing to do with that at all

4087.2 --> 4093.4399999999996
yeah captain caveman can you please

4090.559 --> 4096.64
address [ __ ] you just

4093.44 --> 4098.88
you just roll out all this stuff in chat

4096.64 --> 4100.799
people are asking you can you please

4098.88 --> 4102.0
clear up what the hell you're talking

4100.799 --> 4105.719
about

4102.0 --> 4105.719
this is getting annoying

4106.0 --> 4113.799
you can explain it you can just say what

4109.279 --> 4113.799000000001
it means what you're talking about

4164.0 --> 4167.52
and delete this space

4171.44 --> 4175.799
i

4172.799 --> 4175.799
know

4193.679 --> 4199.92
captain caveman you literally dropped an

4196.88 --> 4202.8
unfamiliar word in this chat

4199.92 --> 4205.04
people have literally asked you about it

4202.8 --> 4208.320000000001
like four times now

4205.04 --> 4212.48
explain it did you misspell that or was

4208.32 --> 4216.5199999999995
it literally that if so what the hell

4212.48 --> 4216.5199999999995
are you talking about

4225.52 --> 4232.080000000001
can you please just address it

4228.32 --> 4236.28
what the [ __ ] is satonic supposed to be

4232.08 --> 4236.28
address it now

4250.32 --> 4253.679
oh god

4252.88 --> 4256.8
see

4253.679 --> 4259.1990000000005
oh that only took you five minutes to

4256.8 --> 4260.56
respond to thanks

4259.199 --> 4264.32
thanks

4260.56 --> 4268.04
for paying attention to what you type

4264.32 --> 4268.04
crying out loud

4279.199 --> 4282.759999999999
yeah no [ __ ]

4290.8 --> 4294.4800000000005
yeah i know

4292.32 --> 4296.4
but at least now we're not puzzled about

4294.48 --> 4298.239
what the hell he was actually talking

4296.4 --> 4300.5599999999995
about

4298.239 --> 4302.159
now it's just another standard thing

4300.56 --> 4303.120000000001
like oh yeah they're

4302.159 --> 4308.839999999999
they're

4303.12 --> 4308.84
doing sick stuff for a secret yeah sure

4318.159 --> 4321.599999999999
i still don't know what the blue marble

4320.4 --> 4322.879999999999
pictures

4321.6 --> 4326.0
do you mean

4322.88 --> 4329.28
blue marble science guy

4326.0 --> 4332.88
or do you mean ball earth

4329.28 --> 4334.48
supposed photographs from nasa right can

4332.88 --> 4336.64
you just

4334.48 --> 4341.32
clear up

4336.64 --> 4341.320000000001
what you're saying

4343.92 --> 4350.679
then a savages right okay

4347.679 --> 4350.679
well

4361.92 --> 4367.36
i don't see what it has to do with

4363.84 --> 4367.360000000001
satanic mirrors though

4367.76 --> 4371.08
at all

4391.199 --> 4395.5599999999995
okay i'm a very sick [ __ ]

4445.6 --> 4451.4400000000005
i have to see the vid okay well captain

4448.48 --> 4454.239
caveman here you got a moderator wrench

4451.44 --> 4456.799999999999
just post it so we can get this [ __ ] out

4454.239 --> 4456.799999999999
of the way

4457.44 --> 4462.639999999999
just get on with it

4459.679 --> 4466.08
i'm sorry my mood is just not good right

4462.64 --> 4466.08
now and i'm pissed off

4466.4 --> 4470.5599999999995
i don't feel got any privacy right now

4471.04 --> 4474.56
just keeping the door open

4475.6 --> 4478.88
you can hear everything they're talking

4477.36 --> 4480.719
about and they probably can hear

4478.88 --> 4482.88
everything i'm talking about and i'm not

4480.719 --> 4486.64
happy about that i want some freaking

4482.88 --> 4486.64
privacy when i'm doing streams

4493.52 --> 4498.080000000001
yeah just post the link

4495.76 --> 4501.12
post the link

4498.08 --> 4504.64
post the link captain caveman post the

4501.12 --> 4508.679
link post the link post the link

4504.64 --> 4508.679
do it do it now

4515.199 --> 4518.44
thank you

4535.84 --> 4539.84
oh my god really

4540.159 --> 4542.48
oh

4546.88 --> 4552.52
oh my god

4548.48 --> 4552.5199999999995
you really made me

4605.36 --> 4608.639999999999
all right

4606.32 --> 4609.759999999999
weed whacker

4608.64 --> 4611.360000000001
goody

4609.76 --> 4613.52
i think i'm gonna run out this show

4611.36 --> 4617.32
early

4613.52 --> 4617.320000000001
it's just not working

4639.04 --> 4643.719
that's right yeah i'm extremely

4640.719 --> 4643.719
distracted

4654.88 --> 4660.400000000001
and i do yeah i don't i just happen to

4657.84 --> 4662.56
not really have anything pressing on my

4660.4 --> 4663.839999999999
mind or anything deep that i'm thinking

4662.56 --> 4667.280000000001
about

4663.84 --> 4669.360000000001
just been had a pretty good rest

4667.28 --> 4672.08
and already got

4669.36 --> 4675.12
anything that was kind of on out on my

4672.08 --> 4677.04
mind out of the way early right like i

4675.12 --> 4679.36
kind of rushed it out

4677.04 --> 4683.28
and that's it there's really not too

4679.36 --> 4683.28
much more to discuss about all that

4688.88 --> 4694.159000000001
i discussed the looping thing

4691.199 --> 4695.199
right explain it in utter utter detail

4694.159 --> 4698.639999999999
every

4695.199 --> 4700.879999999999
conceivable part about it i explained

4698.64 --> 4702.0
yet i'm not really getting any responses

4700.88 --> 4704.0
to that

4702.0 --> 4707.6
at all

4704.0 --> 4711.12
just comparisons to sci-fi movies that

4707.6 --> 4713.360000000001
literally do not describe that

4711.12 --> 4716.32
it's a different type of loop so it's

4713.36 --> 4719.96
like space-time [ __ ] has nothing to do

4716.32 --> 4719.96
with spatial looping

4772.64 --> 4777.84
with a sniffer

4774.56 --> 4777.84
that sounds very australian

4785.6 --> 4789.679
that's something you wanted to get into

4788.48 --> 4792.799999999999
well there's

4789.679 --> 4796.2390000000005
like 20 what was it

4792.8 --> 4796.2390000000005
35 more minutes left

4797.04 --> 4801.5199999999995
so if you want to bring something up

4798.8 --> 4804.400000000001
fine if it's too big or whatever then

4801.52 --> 4808.639
i'll just

4804.4 --> 4812.92
tell you to wait for another show

4808.639 --> 4812.92
hello james mason by the way

4828.639 --> 4834.400000000001
okay poof

4832.4 --> 4837.36
yeah that's not really a

4834.4 --> 4837.36
small subject

4837.52 --> 4840.56
and to be fair

4841.44 --> 4844.719
there's a lot

4842.8 --> 4847.76
there's a lot of people that know a lot

4844.719 --> 4850.76
more about the specifics of that than i

4847.76 --> 4850.76
do

4860.4 --> 4866.839999999999
what

4862.56 --> 4866.84
are you doing good servant

4916.159 --> 4921.08
all right need two minute break i'll be

4917.84 --> 4921.08
right back

4933.6 --> 4936.6
so

5038.8 --> 5044.400000000001
ah i'm back

5040.88 --> 5044.400000000001
they closed the door

5046.719 --> 5050.56
that seems like

5048.32 --> 5053.92
the girl was actually listening to her

5050.56 --> 5057.8
own podcast not this one by the way

5053.92 --> 5057.8
that would be weird

5058.56 --> 5061.679
it's like hey what are you watching

5060.8 --> 5063.6
hmm

5061.679 --> 5066.08
that looks familiar

5063.6 --> 5068.56
where's the presenter oh wait that's me

5066.08 --> 5071.719
and that would be weird but that was not

5068.56 --> 5071.719
the case

5079.679 --> 5083.679
hey steamy traveler no never heard of

5082.639 --> 5087.08
him

5083.679 --> 5087.08
what is that

5114.88 --> 5118.52
oh my god

5126.48 --> 5132.08
californian

5129.28 --> 5134.48
oh goody

5132.08 --> 5134.48
dude

5136.0 --> 5141.32
whatever i don't know anything about it

5157.12 --> 5162.08
it it gets pretty creepy when it is the

5159.6 --> 5164.8
default assumption like yeah i'm a

5162.08 --> 5167.04
co-worker with god like oh yeah yeah oh

5164.8 --> 5168.88
so you're like a demi representative are

5167.04 --> 5172.32
you

5168.88 --> 5172.32
like i don't even say that

5177.12 --> 5181.36
that's like the entire issue is that if

5179.44 --> 5183.44
you're going to have some exoteric

5181.36 --> 5187.12
system

5183.44 --> 5190.08
where it is the default saying like oh

5187.12 --> 5193.5199999999995
we're with god like immediately a

5190.08 --> 5193.5199999999995
problem immediately

5193.76 --> 5198.4800000000005
corruption is inevitable corruption

5196.159 --> 5201.199
within the mind

5198.48 --> 5201.199
inevitable

5201.28 --> 5208.88
like no nothing nothing

5205.12 --> 5212.239
it's just you just you as an individual

5208.88 --> 5216.08
doing your best figuring it out

5212.239 --> 5216.839999999999
no groups no not like that

5216.08 --> 5220.4
right

5216.84 --> 5220.400000000001
cooperations perhaps

5220.8 --> 5225.360000000001
just like as soon as you're like oh i'm

5222.4 --> 5227.839999999999
part of this group

5225.36 --> 5229.92
especially when it's specifically about

5227.84 --> 5233.719
religion it's just like

5229.92 --> 5233.719
just looking for trouble

5250.48 --> 5255.36
was there anything you had to say about

5252.56 --> 5259.320000000001
it steamy traveler

5255.36 --> 5259.32
bringing it up and all

5291.52 --> 5295.719
all right good night iron 26

5301.199 --> 5303.919999999999
enough of that

5304.96 --> 5309.639
it's like right underneath here

5311.28 --> 5316.5599999999995
those curious if i heard of it no no

5313.6 --> 5320.4800000000005
there's a million things out there i've

5316.56 --> 5323.1990000000005
never ever heard of ever not even close

5320.48 --> 5326.839999999999
millions and millions of things

5323.199 --> 5326.839999999999
never heard of

5345.84 --> 5350.400000000001
that's right the so many dumb weird

5349.12 --> 5353.679
cults out there

5350.4 --> 5355.599999999999
yeah and america is like central

5353.679 --> 5358.0
it's like

5355.6 --> 5359.52
a giant

5358.0 --> 5361.44
cult

5359.52 --> 5365.120000000001
breeding ground for some reason like

5361.44 --> 5369.04
every freaking individual in america

5365.12 --> 5370.719
is viable to create their own damn cult

5369.04 --> 5373.5199999999995
it's insane

5370.719 --> 5375.28
like literally insane

5373.52 --> 5378.280000000001
it's like just

5375.28 --> 5378.28
cultists

5380.0 --> 5385.52
the need to surrender yourself

5383.199 --> 5388.0
to some system or group and lose

5385.52 --> 5388.88
yourself within it

5388.0 --> 5392.6
right

5388.88 --> 5392.6
just like communism

5394.92 --> 5398.06
[Music]

5399.199 --> 5403.839999999999
tax exempt yeah of course

5401.29 --> 5406.159
[Music]

5403.84 --> 5408.8
i mean wow that's such a good reason

5406.159 --> 5410.0
right oh oh just creating religion tax

5408.8 --> 5411.52
exemption

5410.0 --> 5413.84
accept

5411.52 --> 5417.1990000000005
accept that means you have to follow the

5413.84 --> 5420.400000000001
[ __ ] federal rules and that means

5417.199 --> 5422.5599999999995
it's not your free heritage of thinking

5420.4 --> 5423.679
and way of doing things anymore because

5422.56 --> 5426.080000000001
now

5423.679 --> 5428.08
you have to play along with the stupid

5426.08 --> 5429.199
ass agendas

5428.08 --> 5432.4
yeah

5429.199 --> 5435.12
america and your precious freedom of

5432.4 --> 5437.28
religion where everybody's free

5435.12 --> 5438.8
to take money

5437.28 --> 5441.5199999999995
handouts

5438.8 --> 5442.719
and become part of the beast system

5441.52 --> 5445.040000000001
problem

5442.719 --> 5446.32
huh are you proud of yourself now

5445.04 --> 5449.84
america

5446.32 --> 5449.84
you proud of yourself

5464.08 --> 5469.5199999999995
i'm in a crappy mood maybe a little

5466.56 --> 5474.4400000000005
i'm doing better though

5469.52 --> 5474.4400000000005
ah freaking weedwacker finding stuff

5480.719 --> 5485.639
but hey what i said is pretty much true

5490.159 --> 5493.44
jesus

5491.44 --> 5495.919999999999
resolved

5493.44 --> 5498.159
to a loop

5495.92 --> 5498.159
what

5502.4 --> 5505.638999999999
an equation

5517.44 --> 5520.5599999999995
i don't see what your

5519.52 --> 5523.679
numer

5520.56 --> 5526.400000000001
numeric equation had anything to do with

5523.679 --> 5530.12
spatial looping

5526.4 --> 5530.12
i don't see the connection

5534.56 --> 5539.1990000000005
yeah yeah dusty writer i agree yeah

5537.12 --> 5541.36
arwenian units yeah it's always funny

5539.199 --> 5543.599999999999
right i bring something up as a little

5541.36 --> 5547.199
silly joke isn't this silly

5543.6 --> 5548.320000000001
oh wait yeah it was actually extremely

5547.199 --> 5550.719
serious

5548.32 --> 5552.799999999999
in a bizarre way that doesn't really

5550.719 --> 5554.639
matter that much but

5552.8 --> 5556.8
yeah that's me

5554.639 --> 5560.56
yeah arwinian units

5556.8 --> 5563.04
it's actually a thought out concept that

5560.56 --> 5566.8
started as a joke because yeah a pair of

5563.04 --> 5569.44
distances right how do you size up

5566.8 --> 5571.76
apparent distances of things that aren't

5569.44 --> 5573.759999999999
in actual locations

5571.76 --> 5576.88
right

5573.76 --> 5580.08
arwenian units apparent distances not

5576.88 --> 5581.28
actual distances but apparent so

5580.08 --> 5585.44
right

5581.28 --> 5587.599999999999
genius nah it's not geniuses it's clever

5585.44 --> 5590.799999999999
that's it

5587.6 --> 5593.84
but even though the apparent distance

5590.8 --> 5596.8
units are completely

5593.84 --> 5599.360000000001
superfluous basically

5596.8 --> 5601.04
they are still a good concept to

5599.36 --> 5604.5599999999995
basically

5601.04 --> 5608.159
make your mind consider

5604.56 --> 5611.84
apparent things in not actual locations

5608.159 --> 5615.12
right it does that

5611.84 --> 5615.12
makes you think about it

5615.6 --> 5619.280000000001
and that is the function really

5619.92 --> 5624.2390000000005
absolutely necessary okay okay

5624.639 --> 5631.4800000000005
i'm proud of it but i don't really see

5626.8 --> 5631.4800000000005
it as like absolutely necessary

5632.48 --> 5636.678999999999
i mean helpful perhaps

5663.52 --> 5667.56
what are you talking about

5672.4 --> 5679.28
what is this about the three times plus

5675.28 --> 5679.28
one i mean that's a pattern

5682.159 --> 5686.96
i actually have

5684.8 --> 5688.400000000001
like specific

5686.96 --> 5689.56
division

5688.4 --> 5691.44
compart

5689.56 --> 5694.0
compartmentalization based on that

5691.44 --> 5695.919999999999
pattern in my dnd

5694.0 --> 5698.56
class developments

5695.92 --> 5700.4800000000005
like certain rhythm in which

5698.56 --> 5701.84
certain traits

5700.48 --> 5704.48
are attained

5701.84 --> 5704.4800000000005
per level

5704.719 --> 5709.28
let's get our winning units

5706.48 --> 5709.28
peer-reviewed

5713.44 --> 5716.4
sure why not

5723.92 --> 5730.0
go ahead bear review our waiting units

5726.32 --> 5730.0
go ahead fine with that

5730.56 --> 5734.56
i mean i'm just simply one of the first

5733.04 --> 5736.639
people to

5734.56 --> 5739.1990000000005
think of defining

5736.639 --> 5741.4400000000005
non-actual distances in a numerical

5739.199 --> 5743.5199999999995
value so

5741.44 --> 5746.5199999999995
you can peer review that as much as you

5743.52 --> 5746.52
like

5758.96 --> 5762.96
not just about apparent distances but

5760.96 --> 5765.44
about legitimacy of the scientific

5762.96 --> 5767.119
method what

5765.44 --> 5769.36
no it has nothing to do with the

5767.119 --> 5771.839999999999
scientific method i'm not proving the

5769.36 --> 5773.44
cause of an effect

5771.84 --> 5776.32
it's just a

5773.44 --> 5778.5599999999995
unit of measurement

5776.32 --> 5780.32
or rather apparent measurement in this

5778.56 --> 5782.320000000001
case

5780.32 --> 5783.599999999999
it's more about holographic

5782.32 --> 5786.88
consciousness

5783.6 --> 5789.280000000001
and apparent non-euclidean things and

5786.88 --> 5791.4400000000005
the awareness of it and its difference

5789.28 --> 5793.119
with actual

5791.44 --> 5796.159
distances

5793.119 --> 5799.5599999999995
to actual euclidean things

5796.159 --> 5799.5599999999995
that's it

5806.639 --> 5812.52
what is collats with the z i don't know

5809.119 --> 5812.5199999999995
what that is

5828.0 --> 5832.48
is the astronomical distance an actual

5831.199 --> 5833.759999999999
distance

5832.48 --> 5836.799999999999
well it's

5833.76 --> 5840.719
suggested to be but it's all based on

5836.8 --> 5842.4800000000005
the giant framework which all rests on

5840.719 --> 5843.44
the r

5842.48 --> 5847.199
value

5843.44 --> 5847.199
among others right

5848.159 --> 5852.239
so it's

5849.44 --> 5854.799999999999
supposed to be an actual distance

5852.239 --> 5858.959999999999
but in reality it's a mathematical

5854.8 --> 5858.96
extrap extrapolated value

5859.36 --> 5862.48
right

5860.56 --> 5865.6
that's what it really is the astronomic

5862.48 --> 5865.599999999999
astronomical unit

5866.32 --> 5870.4
my armenian units don't do that they

5868.88 --> 5874.2390000000005
don't

5870.4 --> 5876.08
rest a framework

5874.239 --> 5879.04
it doesn't rest on some kind of a

5876.08 --> 5882.32
framework in order to establish the

5879.04 --> 5883.76
reality of a value no it's specifically

5882.32 --> 5886.639
about

5883.76 --> 5886.639
establishing

5886.8 --> 5890.56
a value

5889.04 --> 5894.719
for a

5890.56 --> 5898.159000000001
claimed not to be actual distance right

5894.719 --> 5901.04
specifically claimed not actual

5898.159 --> 5902.96
but still relevant that's the thing it

5901.04 --> 5906.32
does

5902.96 --> 5908.88
in yeah in contrast to the astronomical

5906.32 --> 5911.84
units which actually do claim to be

5908.88 --> 5914.08
actual distances based on

5911.84 --> 5916.32
the mathematical framework that rests on

5914.08 --> 5916.32
are

5918.719 --> 5922.199
there is 106.

5925.76 --> 5929.679
yeah well it's been a while dude and

5927.52 --> 5932.679
this guy's been here now in every day in

5929.679 --> 5932.679
chat

5943.44 --> 5945.678999999999
uh

5949.6 --> 5955.84
oh evidence is flat oh really oh really

5952.56 --> 5958.400000000001
what's the evident it's not flat

5955.84 --> 5958.400000000001
janet

5959.199 --> 5964.44
a ram on your keyboard value

5976.48 --> 5981.36
non euclidean

5979.52 --> 5983.280000000001
sphere

5981.36 --> 5986.28
of perspective

5983.28 --> 5986.28
what

5998.719 --> 6002.32
it's convex

6000.72 --> 6006.84
[Music]

6002.32 --> 6006.84
really so where's the curvature then

6008.56 --> 6011.76
what is

6009.84 --> 6015.360000000001
if it's convex

6011.76 --> 6015.360000000001
what is the actual

6015.52 --> 6022.159000000001
radial value of its convexity because

6019.44 --> 6026.159
you're not claiming it's a complete ball

6022.159 --> 6030.239
that's fine so what is the radial

6026.159 --> 6030.239
value of its convexity

6030.56 --> 6033.56
janet

6062.32 --> 6068.199
dude

6063.199 --> 6068.199
one for the unit what the hell man

6082.56 --> 6085.92
whoa

6083.84 --> 6089.360000000001
yeah okay i get it like

6085.92 --> 6093.84
nathan yamaha like what

6089.36 --> 6093.839999999999
the bloody hell are you talking about

6096.719 --> 6102.679
boiled fish after the resurrection

6099.679 --> 6102.679
okay

6119.76 --> 6121.84
what

6122.08 --> 6128.76
so we ate some fish

6124.96 --> 6128.76
like what's the point

6136.4 --> 6141.5599999999995
destruction of life

6138.239 --> 6141.5599999999995
oh really

6141.76 --> 6148.0
well in that case stop eating then go

6145.04 --> 6152.0
ahead stop eating

6148.0 --> 6153.28
you know what is also life

6152.0 --> 6156.159
plants

6153.28 --> 6158.88
plants are alive did you know that one

6156.159 --> 6158.879999999999
for the unit

6160.4 --> 6166.159
so yeah you got a problem

6163.199 --> 6169.919999999999
if you think it's that

6166.159 --> 6171.759999999999
it matters that much to the that did any

6169.92 --> 6173.28
destruction of life you got a problem

6171.76 --> 6174.96
because that means you're going to have

6173.28 --> 6177.84
to starve to death

6174.96 --> 6177.84
you understand

6178.8 --> 6182.52
i wouldn't go there

6199.44 --> 6203.678999999999
vegans are planned abusers yeah

6201.92 --> 6206.679
well you could say that by the same

6203.679 --> 6206.679
standard

6238.96 --> 6246.4
well nathan yamaha you know laugh it up

6242.239 --> 6251.04
you literally just suggested that that

6246.4 --> 6252.159
jesus was ungodly because he ate a fish

6251.04 --> 6255.6
okay

6252.159 --> 6255.599999999999
so yeah laugh it up

6255.92 --> 6260.56
i think that dusty writer's statement is

6258.239 --> 6263.28
a lot more legitimate than what you just

6260.56 --> 6263.280000000001
blurted out

6266.96 --> 6273.199
that's right flower lover plants do have

6269.6 --> 6275.84
feelings i know from practical reality

6273.199 --> 6275.839999999999
that they do

6289.44 --> 6292.44
what

6303.119 --> 6306.48
oh

6304.48 --> 6310.4
um what

6306.48 --> 6310.4
i'm getting a little jumbled up here

6314.88 --> 6321.6
okay yeah one for why did you say that

6318.56 --> 6324.320000000001
i i scrolled back and yeah nathan yamaha

6321.6 --> 6326.159000000001
didn't did give no such hint why did you

6324.32 --> 6328.239
say that

6326.159 --> 6331.839999999999
you believe jesus was a kid like why

6328.239 --> 6331.839999999999
would you say that

6342.96 --> 6346.4
prince charles talks the plan oh good on

6345.36 --> 6349.199
him

6346.4 --> 6352.799999999999
i talk to plants too or rather i don't

6349.199 --> 6352.799999999999
really yeah i do sometimes talk

6354.159 --> 6358.5599999999995
but i tend to talk to them like i would

6356.239 --> 6361.36
like talk to a dog

6358.56 --> 6364.92
which is not like at full

6361.36 --> 6364.92
serious intellect

6389.04 --> 6393.4
yeah no they're not

6421.04 --> 6425.119
invite my plants and occasionally hug my

6423.199 --> 6427.5199999999995
tree well hey trees

6425.119 --> 6429.92
are great for hugging it feels a little

6427.52 --> 6431.76
silly if you're not used to that

6429.92 --> 6434.8
but yeah there's some really special

6431.76 --> 6438.0
trees out there they have special vibes

6434.8 --> 6441.28
and they have their own old spirit

6438.0 --> 6443.44
and plants they really like it when you

6441.28 --> 6444.96
touch them

6443.44 --> 6446.4
gently

6444.96 --> 6448.719
they like to be

6446.4 --> 6450.159
normally out there the wind does that a

6448.719 --> 6452.4800000000005
lot but it's

6450.159 --> 6454.719
like scientifically proven that if you

6452.48 --> 6457.119
literally just

6454.719 --> 6460.159
face not just stare at your plant and

6457.119 --> 6463.04
talk but actually also like kind of like

6460.159 --> 6466.159
as you would go through somebody's hair

6463.04 --> 6468.239
plants find that stimulating

6466.159 --> 6471.28
they stay stronger and healthier if you

6468.239 --> 6473.919999999999
do that with plants if you physically

6471.28 --> 6473.92
touch them

6475.36 --> 6478.36
really

6499.28 --> 6503.5199999999995
no well one footer unit that's not

6501.199 --> 6505.759999999999
universal though

6503.52 --> 6509.360000000001
it depends

6505.76 --> 6511.1990000000005
on your inherited metabolism on your

6509.36 --> 6514.32
system on your

6511.199 --> 6516.0
yeah on your genetics it really does

6514.32 --> 6516.96
depend

6516.0 --> 6519.76
there's

6516.96 --> 6521.92
groups out there that do extremely well

6519.76 --> 6524.719
on a vegetarian diet and they can live

6521.92 --> 6526.88
their entire lives like that

6524.719 --> 6529.199
there's other groups of people that

6526.88 --> 6531.1990000000005
absolutely could not

6529.199 --> 6533.5199999999995
do that without

6531.199 --> 6536.879999999999
collapsing

6533.52 --> 6538.320000000001
so it depends per person it really does

6536.88 --> 6541.76
it one

6538.32 --> 6543.679
group of people just isn't the same as

6541.76 --> 6545.280000000001
the other they have other metabolisms

6543.679 --> 6547.28
they have all their

6545.28 --> 6550.719
food needs

6547.28 --> 6550.719
and that's just a fact

6551.76 --> 6556.2390000000005
and it's up to every person in every

6554.159 --> 6559.598999999999
family to find out

6556.239 --> 6562.638999999999
what is it that our

6559.599 --> 6566.08
bloodline our genetics need

6562.639 --> 6568.2390000000005
not what we want we like now what do we

6566.08 --> 6569.679
actually need it's important to find

6568.239 --> 6572.4
this out like

6569.679 --> 6574.32
do we really need meat or do we

6572.4 --> 6576.159
periodically need meat or we don't

6574.32 --> 6577.92
really respond well to meat or is it

6576.159 --> 6582.679
just some meats that we don't respond

6577.92 --> 6582.679
well to you gotta figure this out

6583.119 --> 6588.119
and then pass on the knowledge to your

6585.119 --> 6588.119
offspring

6603.679 --> 6608.639
do people vegetarians live longer than

6606.0 --> 6613.199
people with lard-filled colons

6608.639 --> 6613.1990000000005
well lard is really not that bad

6615.36 --> 6617.839999999999
it's actually

6616.719 --> 6620.4
much

6617.84 --> 6621.360000000001
better for your system than you might

6620.4 --> 6624.96
think

6621.36 --> 6627.119
but again it all depends on

6624.96 --> 6630.0
how much pesticides

6627.119 --> 6631.119
how healthy were the animals

6630.0 --> 6632.88
right

6631.119 --> 6634.08
like good

6632.88 --> 6635.1990000000005
organic

6634.08 --> 6637.76
fat

6635.199 --> 6640.239
from animals is actually extremely

6637.76 --> 6642.8
healthy it's good for you and your body

6640.239 --> 6644.28
can process that very well

6642.8 --> 6646.0
unless you are

6644.28 --> 6648.239
predispositioned to have a more

6646.0 --> 6652.239
vegetarian diet and then you might have

6648.239 --> 6654.799999999999
like your body be like no no

6652.239 --> 6657.44
it's just gonna flush right through you

6654.8 --> 6658.2390000000005
or maybe cause problems

6657.44 --> 6659.759999999999
but

6658.239 --> 6662.4
there's a whole bunch of people in the

6659.76 --> 6667.4800000000005
world myself included that actually

6662.4 --> 6667.48
respond really well to animal fats

6669.119 --> 6674.719
but one of those things for example i

6671.36 --> 6677.598999999999
avoid pig meat and fat

6674.719 --> 6678.639
because in my family that

6677.599 --> 6681.4400000000005
has

6678.639 --> 6684.0
resulted in issues

6681.44 --> 6684.96
mostly skin issues

6684.0 --> 6687.36
right

6684.96 --> 6691.0
that's i learned from that and i avoided

6687.36 --> 6691.0
it ever since

6696.0 --> 6699.36
hunt some sprouts

6700.8 --> 6704.639
right your brain does need cholesterol

6704.719 --> 6711.36
nothing is better for that than fish oil

6706.88 --> 6714.8
right poor fishies i know it's very sad

6711.36 --> 6718.44
but yeah i'll trick i'll take the brain

6714.8 --> 6718.4400000000005
juice thanks

6729.84 --> 6732.84
so

6769.599 --> 6773.119000000001
uh

6771.36 --> 6773.92
no nathan

6773.119 --> 6776.0
no

6773.92 --> 6780.32
no jesus

6776.0 --> 6781.679
is jesus he's a prophet he's with god he

6780.32 --> 6784.159
got it

6781.679 --> 6786.32
he was the best of us he understood

6784.159 --> 6789.839999999999
things about reality

6786.32 --> 6791.44
that all of humanity has ever

6789.84 --> 6794.639
ever since has

6791.44 --> 6796.48
struggled very hard to even get close to

6794.639 --> 6799.4400000000005
what he was doing

6796.48 --> 6801.5199999999995
yeah he was the best of us

6799.44 --> 6804.48
it's not god

6801.52 --> 6807.92
doesn't pray to himself

6804.48 --> 6810.159
he doesn't complain to himself why did i

6807.92 --> 6812.4800000000005
abandon me no no no no

6810.159 --> 6812.48
right

6815.04 --> 6820.639
don't idolatress

6817.599 --> 6822.400000000001
don't idolaterize i think it's called

6820.639 --> 6824.400000000001
that's how you say it right

6822.4 --> 6826.719
don't do that he literally warned

6824.4 --> 6829.5199999999995
against it

6826.719 --> 6831.76
and when he's describing

6829.52 --> 6832.88
the power of god and his

6831.76 --> 6835.04
relation

6832.88 --> 6840.0
that's just it

6835.04 --> 6843.5199999999995
he's basically saying yeah i am with god

6840.0 --> 6845.36
i feel him through me i'm close

6843.52 --> 6846.56
he is not

6845.36 --> 6849.199
god

6846.56 --> 6851.280000000001
that doesn't work

6849.199 --> 6854.638999999999
that's idolatry

6851.28 --> 6858.08
that's what he warns against

6854.639 --> 6861.08
have a connection with god not some

6858.08 --> 6861.08
icon

6863.28 --> 6869.679
you don't believe in a trinity no

6866.719 --> 6872.639
i think it's ridiculous i think it's a

6869.679 --> 6874.84
an ancient an old one

6872.639 --> 6878.719
i think it's a wizard spell

6874.84 --> 6880.56
trap spell trap for the mind of people

6878.719 --> 6882.32
people get caught up with it and then

6880.56 --> 6883.84
they completely

6882.32 --> 6886.0
lose it

6883.84 --> 6888.08
very similar

6886.0 --> 6890.639
to flat earth allergies

6888.08 --> 6892.48
very similar to that

6890.639 --> 6895.599
completely lose their minds over it

6892.48 --> 6898.959999999999
because they have signed on to the

6895.599 --> 6902.56
blatant indoctrination

6898.96 --> 6905.28
say this riddle say it like this if

6902.56 --> 6908.159000000001
anybody contradicts the riddle

6905.28 --> 6911.5199999999995
they are the enemy yeah

6908.159 --> 6914.638999999999
that's called indoctrination right

6911.52 --> 6916.320000000001
so unless you could absolutely

6914.639 --> 6918.96
explain to me

6916.32 --> 6921.04
how it makes mechanically sense the

6918.96 --> 6922.639
trinity that is how it mechanically

6921.04 --> 6926.96
makes sense

6922.639 --> 6929.84
and abides by the very laws of god and

6926.96 --> 6932.159
the words of jesus

6929.84 --> 6935.4400000000005
then i'll listen but i've never heard

6932.159 --> 6939.679
anybody even respond to that notion

6935.44 --> 6939.678999999999
just all caught up in fear spiraling

6940.0 --> 6946.52
you're just afraid you'll be ejected

6942.96 --> 6946.52
from the cult

6946.96 --> 6949.44
crazy

6949.679 --> 6953.36
channel the big bear

6952.08 --> 6954.8
well

6953.36 --> 6957.199
yeah

6954.8 --> 6957.1990000000005
a little

6957.28 --> 6964.0
but hey i had those thoughts myself

6961.199 --> 6964.0
for decades

6964.159 --> 6969.92
i was already on to that for a while

6966.96 --> 6972.719
every time somebody says those exoteric

6969.92 --> 6975.679
chants it says he died for your sins i'm

6972.719 --> 6978.2390000000005
just immediately feel choked like

6975.679 --> 6980.56
this is disgusting you literally don't

6978.239 --> 6982.879999999999
know what the [ __ ] you're saying

6980.56 --> 6986.119000000001
and you think you're all good good boy

6982.88 --> 6986.119
for it

6992.719 --> 6997.84
right but owen definitely really brought

6995.52 --> 6999.76
it out on the table and i

6997.84 --> 7002.159000000001
yeah i fall out step

6999.76 --> 7003.92
it was like okay so it's time now it's

7002.159 --> 7006.4
time now that we can do this that we can

7003.92 --> 7008.56
confront this finally

7006.4 --> 7012.5199999999995
because i was getting really sick of it

7008.56 --> 7012.52
on many many fronts

7018.08 --> 7024.0
there is no absolute morality wrong

7020.639 --> 7025.76
there is absolute morality

7024.0 --> 7028.56
that's the whole point

7025.76 --> 7032.639
it's that it is absolute

7028.56 --> 7034.56
it's right and wrong it is absolute oh

7032.639 --> 7037.679
you can deal with it

7034.56 --> 7040.4800000000005
we as a person have to balance it yeah

7037.679 --> 7044.0
that's cute that's true

7040.48 --> 7047.5199999999995
there is an absolute though the concept

7044.0 --> 7050.159
is absolute one or the other

7047.52 --> 7052.639
now how we have to get around in our

7050.159 --> 7054.32
life and deal with it is another manner

7052.639 --> 7055.84
right we deal

7054.32 --> 7057.28
with the test

7055.84 --> 7059.4400000000005
with the sins

7057.28 --> 7061.28
from within with the earthly we have to

7059.44 --> 7063.5199999999995
deal with that we have to balance things

7061.28 --> 7065.44
out with our ego in order to survive

7063.52 --> 7068.320000000001
ourselves right

7065.44 --> 7070.719
but moral morality is

7068.32 --> 7072.88
absolute

7070.719 --> 7075.84
it is

7072.88 --> 7079.679
there's lies and there's truth

7075.84 --> 7082.88
and that's already pretty damn absolute

7079.679 --> 7082.88
and that's just a starter

7084.4 --> 7089.679
it seems you believe in it no no no no

7086.719 --> 7091.44
no he's a follower of mine he believes

7089.679 --> 7094.719
what i say

7091.44 --> 7096.96
yeah i was into flat earth way before he

7094.719 --> 7099.44
came onto the scene

7096.96 --> 7102.08
flower lover

7099.44 --> 7105.5199999999995
but i do like him

7102.08 --> 7109.159
i like his works i feel

7105.52 --> 7109.159000000001
close to it

7118.159 --> 7123.839999999999
blasphemy oh you you want to get banned

7259.679 --> 7264.2390000000005
whatever right anyway

7262.08 --> 7265.92
i hope to see you back on the thousandth

7264.239 --> 7268.32
episode don't know what what's going to

7265.92 --> 7270.88
be like don't count on anything special

7268.32 --> 7273.36
it's just a number

7270.88 --> 7276.2390000000005
it's just the fourth digit coming in

7273.36 --> 7277.119
that's it that's all

7276.239 --> 7279.36
right

7277.119 --> 7281.199
i will also join the flat earth debates

7279.36 --> 7284.159
which should probably have been

7281.199 --> 7287.44
running for like five minutes now

7284.159 --> 7290.889999999999
but anyway until the next video

7287.44 --> 7304.29
keep it flat

7290.89 --> 7304.29
[Music]

7305.44 --> 7322.169999999999
she

7307.54 --> 7322.17
[Music]

7340.88 --> 7342.96
