111.96 --> 114.79899999999999
yesterday but

115.619 --> 120.06
it was a bit of clear sky and Sun

117.78 --> 121.2
earlier but

120.06 --> 123.42
no

121.2 --> 126.02000000000001
yeah it's still coming through but it's

123.42 --> 126.02
not very

126.24 --> 133.379
not very strong I mean there's no real

128.28 --> 136.379
Sun hitting the place right now but

133.379 --> 136.379
foreign

137.42 --> 142.28
does look like it could be better

139.68 --> 142.28
weather

142.62 --> 145.58
in a few hours

146.72 --> 150.72
right anyway

hope you are all having a

181.76 --> 187.319
fine Friday

184.92 --> 189.5
man I can't believe it's almost November

187.319 --> 189.5
again

189.959 --> 194.239
this month has kind of flown by

195.54 --> 197.54
um

197.819 --> 200.0
foreign

201.68 --> 204.899
[Music]

205.86 --> 212.12
anyway yeah I uh woke up pretty late so

210.06 --> 214.26
I'm still kind of like

212.12 --> 216.3
waking up a little

214.26 --> 219.06
but I'm here and I'm not even starting

216.3 --> 223.70000000000002
that late and all

219.06 --> 223.7
hello iron 26 let's see you

231.299 --> 234.44
in there

251.939 --> 260.359
time flies when you're so you're

256.019 --> 260.359
slaughtering sacred cows am I really

261.299 --> 264.07899999999995
uh

267.0 --> 272.54
I mean I'm not that much on the nose

269.46 --> 272.53999999999996
with the current thing

273.32 --> 279.65999999999997
the current sacred Slaughter

276.8 --> 283.58
but yeah

279.66 --> 283.58000000000004
try to play around with it a little

287.16 --> 291.6
I slaughtered a few

290.16 --> 294.8
yeah

291.6 --> 294.8
I mean fair enough

298.56 --> 303.66
right but I mean

301.259 --> 305.699
compared to for example Owen Benjamin

303.66 --> 309.36
now that's a man who's

305.699 --> 312.72
a true sacred cow butcher I mean

309.36 --> 315.68
he does it continually

312.72 --> 315.68
he aims to

316.32 --> 321.74
but uh yeah

318.78 --> 321.73999999999995
I do my best

324.78 --> 328.13899999999995
but I feel more like a butcher's

326.759 --> 332.24
assistant than

328.139 --> 332.24
the main man or anything

333.49 --> 336.779
[Music]

347.52 --> 351.24
right anyway

351.3 --> 354.56
what was I doing

355.199 --> 357.74
foreign

361.58 --> 366.74
ERS debate was yeah it was pretty cool

367.62 --> 370.46
uh

372.06 --> 378.9
although yeah

374.759 --> 383.18
QA got in and got kind of rude

378.9 --> 383.17999999999995
but uh yeah I don't mind

384.06 --> 388.34
as long as he doesn't do it every day

398.88 --> 404.539
Jim Bob live I watched I was hilarious

406.02 --> 410.21999999999997
caught a little bit of flat swords but

408.539 --> 412.5
uh

410.22 --> 415.91900000000004
I mean yeah he's covering up against

412.5 --> 418.02
conspiracy cats but God conspiracy cats

415.919 --> 421.02
is so annoying

418.02 --> 422.94
so yeah I I did not hang around long

421.02 --> 425.58
because it's just like

422.94 --> 429.96
okay if he really likes doing that I'm

425.58 --> 431.75899999999996
just like maybe the 2017 me would have

429.96 --> 434.09999999999997
been like oh yeah

431.759 --> 436.68
what an opportunity to study but now

434.1 --> 439.68
it's like oh I'm so saturated with these

436.68 --> 442.88
people I mean

439.68 --> 442.88
I'm just done with it

445.86 --> 454.86
it's starting to nauseate me literally

450.24 --> 458.699
so what a a flat side is on a roll with

454.86 --> 464.24
that best of luck I mean

458.699 --> 464.24
if he wants to do that then yeah why not

465.12 --> 471.9
if anything it's good to have like a

469.5 --> 473.52
stick in the water right to see how deep

471.9 --> 476.4
the bottom is

473.52 --> 478.02
so in a way flat side is doing that it's

476.4 --> 480.29999999999995
just like

478.02 --> 481.79999999999995
showing you how sticky this swamp is

480.3 --> 487.46000000000004
becoming

481.8 --> 487.46000000000004
is useful for somebody to do that

487.86 --> 491.24
but I'm not gonna do it

494.16 --> 498.41900000000004
Kanye is on the roll

496.8 --> 501.599
uh

498.419 --> 505.02
or he's on some kind of roll

501.599 --> 507.199
but he's also well losing backing I

505.02 --> 507.19899999999996
think

507.78 --> 512.3389999999999
there's a whole bunch of people that are

509.699 --> 513.539
are really like kind of panicking over

512.339 --> 517.32
him

513.539 --> 519.899
not because oh no anti-Semitism it

517.32 --> 521.099
because they're personally affected it's

519.899 --> 525.44
because

521.099 --> 525.44
they just can't handle that being done

527.459 --> 531.66
the way that he's doing it

530.16 --> 534.98
because

531.66 --> 534.98
Kanye is like

535.94 --> 543.36
persistently unsubtle with how he does

539.339 --> 545.0400000000001
things it's like his thing almost

543.36 --> 548.04
and

545.04 --> 548.04
well

553.5 --> 560.18
I mean I hope I hope it works out for

557.279 --> 560.18
him and he yeah

562.56 --> 568.8599999999999
he goes wherever he needs to be

566.459 --> 572.16
all right even if that means that he now

568.86 --> 574.74
is not the richest black man in America

572.16 --> 577.76
anymore right

574.74 --> 577.76
or in the world

578.279 --> 583.32
we'll see what happens

581.04 --> 586.88
I'm not too opinionated about it I'm

583.32 --> 586.88
staying kind of Semitic neutral

595.339 --> 600.08
yep yeah I noticed

605.36 --> 608.539
[Music]

615.72 --> 618.72
foreign

626.899 --> 630.68
AC also

649.26 --> 651.86
foreign

660.26 --> 666.06
what's the temperature

662.42 --> 669.019
so I like to wonder if I maybe should be

666.06 --> 669.0189999999999
putting on a sweater

670.92 --> 677.18
I don't know wow it's 21 degrees

674.22 --> 677.1800000000001
that's warm

677.22 --> 680.48
really warm

681.66 --> 684.38
huh

686.1 --> 691.5790000000001
it's weird

688.2 --> 691.5790000000001
but nice I guess

692.399 --> 696.48
right well it doesn't feel all that warm

694.56 --> 700.16
when the sun is not hitting the place so

696.48 --> 700.16
but I guess it's really warm

709.079 --> 713.18
16 degrees over there oh right

732.36 --> 740.66
is 30 something here but that's probably

735.3 --> 740.66
in Fahrenheit right iron 26.

740.82 --> 743.82

764.91 --> 767.9499999999999

937.56 --> 945.38

942.36 --> 945.38
where are you

945.839 --> 948.98
at the tropics

949.019 --> 954.92
30 Celsius is a lot for this time of

951.42 --> 954.92
year pretty much anywhere

964.32 --> 970.32
okay

967.04 --> 973.2199999999999
minus one oh wow it's freezing already

970.32 --> 973.22
in the Shire

980.82 --> 983.899
in Australia

984.42 --> 987.3199999999999
hmm

990.0 --> 995.72
okay that still seems a little early for

993.06 --> 995.7199999999999
30 degrees

1000.019 --> 1007.72
that's like early spring

1003.199 --> 1007.7199999999999
to them or something I don't know anyway

1010.519 --> 1013.54
good to know

1014.3 --> 1018.3389999999999
and iron 26 is from Australia

1018.53 --> 1021.65
[Music]

[Music]

1046.28 --> 1048.459
thank you

1053.6 --> 1059.8999999999999
right so yeah

1056.6 --> 1062.9599999999998
what can we talk about

1059.9 --> 1065.179
one and a half hour

1062.96 --> 1068.1200000000001
talk about

1065.179 --> 1071.14
well whatever you want to specifically

1068.12 --> 1071.1399999999999
want talk about

1071.24 --> 1073.72
anyway

1076.94 --> 1081.26
I Do by the way get these typical types

1079.64 --> 1083.8400000000001
of updates that you're also talking

1081.26 --> 1085.82
about like Kanye and all that I get a

1083.84 --> 1089.24
lot of that actually

1085.82 --> 1091.22
through my personal gossip corner but I

1089.24 --> 1094.34
love it there

1091.22 --> 1097.3600000000001
lift the veil Nathan stalpin

1094.34 --> 1097.36
through D live

1098.48 --> 1103.82
because he's always like but yet it's

1101.36 --> 1106.82
it's weird also because Nathan is really

1103.82 --> 1109.3999999999999
kind of like overly nervous about these

1106.82 --> 1112.039
things sometimes

1109.4 --> 1114.74
dare I say scared which is

1112.039 --> 1116.559
kind of a weak trait but hey it's his

1114.74 --> 1119.299
life

1116.559 --> 1120.28
I'm certainly not acting like that in

1119.299 --> 1124.5
the chat

1120.28 --> 1127.549
I get very jokish and blunt

1124.5 --> 1127.549
[Music]

1127.82 --> 1133.24
but that's always been of a guilty

1129.559 --> 1133.24
pleasure but he screams very late

1135.14 --> 1139.24
one or two for my time

1147.32 --> 1149.98
foreign

1159.16 --> 1164.5
political situation seems to be heating

1161.78 --> 1164.5
further up

1164.62 --> 1170.2399999999998
just more and more and more things more

1168.74 --> 1172.58
bizarre

1170.24 --> 1175.46
scandalous things and Admissions and all

1172.58 --> 1176.84
that and like this pile is starting to

1175.46 --> 1179.66
pile up

1176.84 --> 1180.799
and these guys

1179.66 --> 1185.0800000000002
from

1180.799 --> 1185.08
a form for democracy and

1185.36 --> 1190.539
party for

1187.82 --> 1190.539
uh

1191.78 --> 1194.9189999999999
freedom and

1195.14 --> 1201.5590000000002
folk folks I don't know how to properly

1199.1 --> 1204.1399999999999
translate that but yeah those parties

1201.559 --> 1206.559
are going at it

1204.14 --> 1206.5590000000002
and

1208.22 --> 1213.74
it might actually lead to something

1211.16 --> 1215.9
it's certainly having a lot of influence

1213.74 --> 1216.74
on the people in general I mean even

1215.9 --> 1220.1000000000001
like

1216.74 --> 1222.679
Dutch normies I think are kind of

1220.1 --> 1225.74
starting to get it and it's kind of

1222.679 --> 1228.44
funny thing to say a bit weird

1225.74 --> 1230.179
but like our normies tend to like catch

1228.44 --> 1232.3400000000001
up a little quicker

1230.179 --> 1234.74
than most even though they're very

1232.34 --> 1238.6999999999998
tenaciously group

1234.74 --> 1243.46
support oriented a lot of them

1238.7 --> 1243.46
it's always like this little extra

1244.1 --> 1249.1999999999998
so they're quicker so it's working I

1246.62 --> 1251.059
think I don't know maybe it's kind of

1249.2 --> 1252.919
hard to tell of course since I affected

1251.059 --> 1255.32
the Emma hermit

1252.919 --> 1258.0800000000002
I don't have an extensive social life I

1255.32 --> 1260.5
don't meet new people all the time face

1258.08 --> 1260.5
to face

1261.1 --> 1265.1
but

1262.76 --> 1267.74
I'd like to thank my of myself as a good

1265.1 --> 1271.1599999999999
spiritual metadata reader and so I do

1267.74 --> 1274.1
pay a lot of attention to

1271.16 --> 1275.96
people being on camera including these

1274.1 --> 1279.9189999999999
politicians

1275.96 --> 1280.88
and there's a lot for me a lot to read

1279.919 --> 1283.76
there

1280.88 --> 1285.74
and that's part of where I well what I

1283.76 --> 1288.559
build my predictions upon

1285.74 --> 1290.179
it's what other people that try to read

1288.559 --> 1292.94
people and then predict what's going to

1290.179 --> 1294.14
happen too they do that too it's just

1292.94 --> 1296.539
that

1294.14 --> 1299.3600000000001
I've got like a special ability for it

1296.539 --> 1301.36
it's just that because I'm also not

1299.36 --> 1303.86
financially

1301.36 --> 1307.3999999999999
exploitive in nature

1303.86 --> 1310.3999999999999
I just keep it kind of quiet

1307.4 --> 1311.19
like I don't want to financially exploit

1310.4 --> 1314.3290000000002
that skill

1311.19 --> 1314.329
[Music]

1315.799 --> 1319.12
I think it's dangerous

1321.32 --> 1326.36
anyway

1323.78 --> 1329.6589999999999
I just use it

1326.36 --> 1331.4599999999998
whenever yeah with everything I mean I

1329.659 --> 1333.0800000000002
just use it with everything I don't want

1331.46 --> 1335.72
to start financially exploiting

1333.08 --> 1339.08
something that's kind of been a skill to

1335.72 --> 1341.8600000000001
really help me survive socially

1339.08 --> 1341.86
so

1345.2 --> 1352.76
I'm just gonna keep it secret keep it

1347.6 --> 1354.86
safe not so secret but save anyway

1352.76 --> 1356.419
England has an Indian Prime Minister

1354.86 --> 1360.5
yeah

1356.419 --> 1363.0800000000002
Indian yeah I know what you mean

1360.5 --> 1366.46
highly dubious character

1363.08 --> 1366.46
very creepy

1367.4 --> 1372.38
that's a man with like

1370.1 --> 1375.4399999999998
that's a man with a poker face that

1372.38 --> 1377.48
doesn't have a regular face

1375.44 --> 1379.88
that's what he looks like to me that's a

1377.48 --> 1381.6200000000001
man who lost his actual face he only has

1379.88 --> 1383.419
a poker face

1381.62 --> 1385.6999999999998
might have been born that way it might

1383.419 --> 1388.24
have been yeah I don't know but he's

1385.7 --> 1388.24
creepy

1391.62 --> 1394.81
[Music]

1399.86 --> 1404.1399999999999
and I don't know how long it's gonna

1401.48 --> 1404.14
last I mean

1405.32 --> 1411.799
them switching out that previous prime

1408.08 --> 1414.1399999999999
minister was kind of bizarre that it

1411.799 --> 1417.74
happened so quickly and that it's

1414.14 --> 1419.419
basically by party executive decision so

1417.74 --> 1421.58
I mean

1419.419 --> 1423.38
who says that this prime minister is

1421.58 --> 1426.559
going to stay in long maybe they're

1423.38 --> 1428.1200000000001
gonna do like a quick Switcheroo there

1426.559 --> 1429.9189999999999
right

1428.12 --> 1433.28
they're just gonna oh one prime minister

1429.919 --> 1435.6200000000001
oh switch him out again a new one and

1433.28 --> 1437.299
then maybe they got like 40 of these

1435.62 --> 1439.76
people lined up and they're gonna switch

1437.299 --> 1443.98
them out every few months

1439.76 --> 1443.98
I'm not even joking I mean

1444.559 --> 1448.0
they're doing it right now

1449.659 --> 1453.2600000000002
I mean the the country is not burning

1452.0 --> 1456.14
down

1453.26 --> 1459.3799999999999
right people are a bit flustered about

1456.14 --> 1460.64
like what what's going on here but

1459.38 --> 1462.5590000000002
yeah

1460.64 --> 1465.0800000000002
doesn't really even seem to matter all

1462.559 --> 1468.2
that much is what the vibe that I'm

1465.08 --> 1469.9399999999998
getting at least for now besides that

1468.2 --> 1471.5
the guy is your creep and then

1469.94 --> 1472.5800000000002
everybody's probably a little worried

1471.5 --> 1475.28
about that

1472.58 --> 1480.46
very reasonably so

1475.28 --> 1480.46
but I mean but they could keep switching

1483.02 --> 1485.5
right

1486.62 --> 1491.8999999999999
and maybe they'll even like switch Boris

1489.32 --> 1493.76
in there back for like a month and then

1491.9 --> 1496.2800000000002
you'll be kicked out again I don't know

1493.76 --> 1498.08
I don't know what the hell's going on in

1496.28 --> 1499.34
England they're playing a really weird

1498.08 --> 1501.62
new game

1499.34 --> 1505.48
and I don't know if they actually know

1501.62 --> 1505.4799999999998
what they're doing for real

1514.4 --> 1519.74
so yeah keep an eye out for that it

1516.679 --> 1521.72
would be kind of funny if I called that

1519.74 --> 1524.5
that they're gonna keep switching out

1521.72 --> 1524.5
prime ministers

1525.32 --> 1531.3999999999999
like regularly

1527.419 --> 1531.4
so yeah we'll see if that happens

1533.9 --> 1539.6000000000001
and if it will then I'd like you to

1536.48 --> 1542.38
remember that Arwin called it

1539.6 --> 1542.3799999999999
foreign

1546.96 --> 1558.6200000000001
[Music]

1554.9 --> 1561.5590000000002
I know M2M I know that

1558.62 --> 1564.26
but it's still bizarre that they would

1561.559 --> 1566.299
be switched out so quickly that doesn't

1564.26 --> 1569.9
happen normally

1566.299 --> 1569.9
right M2M

1571.46 --> 1574.96
if always switched down

1577.4 --> 1583.539
yeah but not that regularly right I mean

1584.419 --> 1590.419
they do it maybe somebody switches out

1587.779 --> 1593.48
after two years because it's like they

1590.419 --> 1596.0
have got this schedule of who's gonna do

1593.48 --> 1596.96
what in what period right as a prime

1596.0 --> 1601.46
minister

1596.96 --> 1604.46
and that is actually not that bad I mean

1601.46 --> 1605.6000000000001
that's pretty useful for planning I

1604.46 --> 1609.44
guess

1605.6 --> 1612.6789999999999
but to quickly switch out like this

1609.44 --> 1616.88
in just a what is it like a month two

1612.679 --> 1619.7
months that is kind of bizarre isn't it

1616.88 --> 1622.22
right so maybe they're like doing

1619.7 --> 1623.6000000000001
something weird new maybe they're gonna

1622.22 --> 1627.919
fluster

1623.6 --> 1630.3999999999999
45 days wow this is less than two months

1627.919 --> 1630.4
right

1632.659 --> 1636.6200000000001
so we'll see how long this one's Gonna

1634.64 --> 1638.72
Last maybe this is like a new game maybe

1636.62 --> 1640.52
they're just playing a distraction trick

1638.72 --> 1643.58
now

1640.52 --> 1646.52
right instead of having like specific

1643.58 --> 1648.9189999999999
influers taking the Reign at the

1646.52 --> 1651.86
specific time to get the people to do go

1648.919 --> 1654.0800000000002
a certain way maybe instead of that it's

1651.86 --> 1655.6999999999998
just like sort of damage control and now

1654.08 --> 1658.82
it's like oh look at this weird new

1655.7 --> 1660.919
prime minister and then oh people it's

1658.82 --> 1663.08
not working uh quickly a new one here's

1660.919 --> 1664.64
the new prime minister oh they're sick

1663.08 --> 1666.1999999999998
of it too and they're just gonna keep

1664.64 --> 1668.72
switching

1666.2 --> 1670.76
maybe that's gonna happen

1668.72 --> 1675.1000000000001
and if it will

1670.76 --> 1675.1
like to say Arwin called it

1676.1 --> 1678.6999999999998
anyway

1680.82 --> 1688.059
[Music]

1684.679 --> 1688.0590000000002
so yeah that's going on

1714.62 --> 1717.34
foreign

1730.1 --> 1734.059
wow

1732.32 --> 1736.46
mini budget

1734.059 --> 1738.32
and then they kicked her out

1736.46 --> 1741.26
so they kicked her out because she did

1738.32 --> 1744.6399999999999
what what she was told to do

1741.26 --> 1744.64
that is ridiculous

1745.52 --> 1752.48
Because by the way that woman right

1750.2 --> 1756.159
there was nothing wrong with her

1752.48 --> 1756.159
maybe that's why they kicked her out

1758.059 --> 1763.8799999999999
but she looked like

1761.36 --> 1764.779
halfway decent person which is kind of

1763.88 --> 1766.94
rare

1764.779 --> 1769.7
for politicians to

1766.94 --> 1771.8600000000001
to be like that but she seemed like kind

1769.7 --> 1774.02
of halfway decent maybe that's why they

1771.86 --> 1776.059
kicked her out so quickly because she

1774.02 --> 1779.6
just did as she was ordered instead of

1776.059 --> 1781.94
trying to grab all the words until

1779.6 --> 1783.98
right until it means something else that

1781.94 --> 1785.059
they actually want

1783.98 --> 1789.2
right

1785.059 --> 1792.08
because it's politicians man

1789.2 --> 1794.179
but maybe she just did exactly what she

1792.08 --> 1794.899
was asked to do and so they kicked her

1794.179 --> 1798.38
out

1794.899 --> 1800.899
can can have that can actually just do

1798.38 --> 1803.659
what you're told

1800.899 --> 1805.2199999999998
have to find a way through to do it

1803.659 --> 1808.72
without doing it

1805.22 --> 1808.72
and then you're the champion

1831.98 --> 1834.76
right

1839.28 --> 1846.279
[Music]

1853.12 --> 1858.32
but yeah

1855.399 --> 1862.34
look as as long as there is going to be

1858.32 --> 1863.9189999999999
any any form even left over influences

1862.34 --> 1866.84
of the

1863.919 --> 1869.2990000000002
wef agenda

1866.84 --> 1871.6999999999998
they're going to have a problem

1869.299 --> 1874.039
right and I heard that King Charles is

1871.7 --> 1877.76
like really into that

1874.039 --> 1880.1
so they have a problem because

1877.76 --> 1881.72
like

1880.1 --> 1884.24
that's

1881.72 --> 1886.1000000000001
like regressive it's literally

1884.24 --> 1888.44
regressive so what the hell can you then

1886.1 --> 1890.6589999999999
do as a politician well all you can do

1888.44 --> 1892.3990000000001
is just make false promises hope that

1890.659 --> 1894.7990000000002
people buy it so they are satisfied

1892.399 --> 1897.52
while you literally pull the rug from

1894.799 --> 1897.52
underneath them

1897.62 --> 1903.1999999999998
and if you're just a straightforward

1900.679 --> 1906.02
like

1903.2 --> 1908.3600000000001
Builder type of politician that just

1906.02 --> 1911.6589999999999
does whatever like straightforward yeah

1908.36 --> 1915.76
that's not gonna work then

1911.659 --> 1915.7600000000002
because it's a ridiculous task

1932.12 --> 1937.52
right

1934.419 --> 1941.44
every every government out there every

1937.52 --> 1945.44
single one that has w e f

1941.44 --> 1948.44
agents in place at infiltrates the

1945.44 --> 1950.659
cabinets right every one of them that

1948.44 --> 1951.8600000000001
has one of those infiltrators in their

1950.659 --> 1953.8990000000001
cabinets

1951.86 --> 1955.36
all those governments are going to be

1953.899 --> 1960.279
dysfunctional

1955.36 --> 1965.779
because wef policy is

1960.279 --> 1965.779
regressive systematically regressive

1974.48 --> 1977.48
right

1986.84 --> 1990.03
[Music]

1992.32 --> 1997.7
[Music]

1994.22 --> 1997.7
hello mtrc

2007.36 --> 2015.6999999999998
right so where any type of dare I say

2011.5 --> 2018.34
good politician shines is when there is

2015.7 --> 2019.72
a building opportunity right when the

2018.34 --> 2022.4189999999999
conditions are right in the country

2019.72 --> 2024.7
financially socially

2022.419 --> 2026.44
that there's like things that need to be

2024.7 --> 2029.559
organized and done

2026.44 --> 2033.76
and then they can be super honest and

2029.559 --> 2037.48
open and just get it done like make the

2033.76 --> 2039.7
connections like build the plans and

2037.48 --> 2040.96
have it done like build something as a

2039.7 --> 2042.159
politician right that's a good

2040.96 --> 2043.299
politician

2042.159 --> 2046.3600000000001
but

2043.299 --> 2049.139
if there's literally like on the program

2046.36 --> 2052.679
yeah we're gonna have to cut down energy

2049.139 --> 2055.48
cut down food production

2052.679 --> 2058.359
and like extreme social control

2055.48 --> 2061.3
everywhere well that's regressive that

2058.359 --> 2065.679
like you can't build with that

2061.3 --> 2068.02
you can only Mesmer people until they

2065.679 --> 2070.48
don't realize anymore that you're

2068.02 --> 2072.879
actually planning to pull the rug

2070.48 --> 2074.32
underneath from them just kind of Mesmer

2072.879 --> 2075.639
them so that when you pull a rug

2074.32 --> 2077.3790000000004
underneath from them that they'll be

2075.639 --> 2078.82
like what what's just happened they

2077.379 --> 2080.08
don't realize that their rug is

2078.82 --> 2082.659
underneath from them they just thought

2080.08 --> 2085.06
oh I just fell over

2082.659 --> 2087.94
and then maybe much later they'll see it

2085.06 --> 2090.22
and then it'll be to wait right that's

2087.94 --> 2093.399
then the tactics that are left

2090.22 --> 2096.339
for a regressive program

2093.399 --> 2097.9
that politicians have to fulfill that

2096.339 --> 2101.74
sucks

2097.9 --> 2104.6800000000003
and you gotta almost be a Grappler to

2101.74 --> 2107.4399999999996
even be able to do that

2104.68 --> 2110.5
because it's really [ __ ] up

2107.44 --> 2114.099
you have to literally lie to people

2110.5 --> 2117.099
to get them to agree to nonsense to

2114.099 --> 2121.78
distract them while you secretly chip

2117.099 --> 2124.92
away at their real necessities

2121.78 --> 2124.92
and that's [ __ ] up

2126.52 --> 2132.94
that that should be blatantly obvious

2129.16 --> 2135.66
that that is a pretty [ __ ] up thing

2150.04 --> 2156.46
yeah

2152.5 --> 2158.44
wow M2M I I did not know that they those

2156.46 --> 2160.96
they claimed those things but it is

2158.44 --> 2164.04
exactly that's a total

2160.96 --> 2167.56
reversed World statement that is 100

2164.04 --> 2169.839
Marxist because it is as you say exactly

2167.56 --> 2172.5
the opposite

2169.839 --> 2176.16
principles of Independence

2172.5 --> 2178.66
impartiality for real life

2176.16 --> 2181.1189999999997
moral integrity

2185.2 --> 2192.839
moral consistency

2187.38 --> 2192.839
perhaps Integrity I don't even

2193.18 --> 2195.2999999999997
know

2196.42 --> 2203.92
Integrity of any form does not

2200.079 --> 2206.579
does not match with that an intellectual

2203.92 --> 2206.579
integrity

2207.04 --> 2211.0
well that's a that's kind of a trick

2209.079 --> 2213.9
statement

2211.0 --> 2213.9
because they are

2216.46 --> 2221.38
honest

2218.38 --> 2223.7200000000003
about how [ __ ] up they see things and

2221.38 --> 2226.2400000000002
what they want

2223.72 --> 2229.18
right

2226.24 --> 2232.66
but at the same time they're

2229.18 --> 2235.74
lying their way through so that kind of

2232.66 --> 2235.74
then proves they're not

2244.54 --> 2249.94
right but the whole point about

2247.119 --> 2252.46
principles of Independence well it's

2249.94 --> 2254.38
ridiculous because it is exactly the

2252.46 --> 2256.9
opposite of that it's like stripping

2254.38 --> 2259.32
away Independence that's their whole

2256.9 --> 2259.32
trick

2261.04 --> 2268.32
you become dependent on the nobility

2263.619 --> 2272.7000000000003
which also yeah the WF nobility figures

2268.32 --> 2277.96
oligarchs which in turn are

2272.7 --> 2280.359
dependent on their well slave states

2277.96 --> 2284.7400000000002
that they squeeze

2280.359 --> 2286.96
for their profit and opportunities

2284.74 --> 2289.68

2322.359 --> 2328.2
that long

2324.339 --> 2328.2
for this world in the open

2328.66 --> 2332.8799999999997
but I do think that these guys might be

2331.78 --> 2335.26
like

2332.88 --> 2337.3
Nazi level 2.

2335.26 --> 2341.5600000000004
in the sense that

2337.3 --> 2343.599
they're really stuck to this formula

2341.56 --> 2346.7799999999997
I think that even if the whole thing

2343.599 --> 2349.1800000000003
blows up or like

2346.78 --> 2352.119
a persecution starts like Cloud swap

2349.18 --> 2353.74
gets arrested and I think that a lot of

2352.119 --> 2355.78
them are gonna go underground and it's

2353.74 --> 2357.04
gonna persist underground kind of like

2355.78 --> 2359.38
Nazis

2357.04 --> 2361.66
but in that formula and that they're

2359.38 --> 2364.42
gonna keep trying to pop up in other

2361.66 --> 2366.64
unexpected places right be the because

2364.42 --> 2369.66
they have all that money so they can

2366.64 --> 2369.66
literally just

2370.3 --> 2374.5
not necessarily even bright but just

2372.91 --> 2378.7
[Music]

2374.5 --> 2381.339
be very convenient like spend a lot and

2378.7 --> 2383.68
be be seen as good guys that are good

2381.339 --> 2386.0789999999997
for black nation and then burrow their

2383.68 --> 2390.54
way in because that's the issue with all

2386.079 --> 2394.48
of them is that they have this giant

2390.54 --> 2395.92
monolithic money power behind them

2394.48 --> 2398.7
right

2395.92 --> 2402.04
they got all the money in the world

2398.7 --> 2406.2999999999997
metaphorically not literally

2402.04 --> 2408.579
and all they really are tasked to do is

2406.3 --> 2412.599
to manipulate

2408.579 --> 2416.52
the power away from the Free People

2412.599 --> 2416.52
with assistance of that money

2417.099 --> 2422.56
so even after this main situation Falls

2420.64 --> 2426.16
and who knows

2422.56 --> 2428.0789999999997
W EF people get arrested then there's

2426.16 --> 2431.56
still that group that's doing that and

2428.079 --> 2436.0600000000004
they might continue Underground

2431.56 --> 2437.619
trying to do the same thing again

2436.06 --> 2440.619
anew

2437.619 --> 2440.619
so

2441.16 --> 2445.5989999999997
gotta keep that into consideration I

2443.44 --> 2448.02
mean this thing has been building for a

2445.599 --> 2448.02
long time

2482.68 --> 2489.8799999999997
what okay MTC no I have not heard of

2486.94 --> 2493.68
that is that real never heard of that

2489.88 --> 2493.6800000000003
did you just make that up right now

2500.74 --> 2503.339
foreign

2521.04 --> 2524.329
[Music]

2528.16 --> 2533.44
is there any YouTube video out there of

2531.52 --> 2536.38
that so that

2533.44 --> 2538.44
or is it just a story that has passed

2536.38 --> 2538.44
around

2539.859 --> 2545.5789999999997
I mean this is kind of like

2543.16 --> 2545.5789999999997
what

2546.16 --> 2552.3999999999996
I mean if there's a video then just tell

2548.38 --> 2554.859
me exactly like the title to search for

2552.4 --> 2559.02
so that yeah I could find it on YouTube

2554.859 --> 2559.02
take a look but I've not heard of that

2566.68 --> 2572.7999999999997
truss was kicked for trying to start

2569.2 --> 2575.2599999999998
fracking well good Jeff gassad fracking

2572.8 --> 2577.6600000000003
is terrible

2575.26 --> 2581.619
yeah

2577.66 --> 2584.7
fracking is extremely bad

2581.619 --> 2584.7000000000003
for the environment

2586.599 --> 2589.5
it is

2590.98 --> 2596.859
it should not be done it's absolutely

2593.56 --> 2599.94
absurd because there is so much oil

2596.859 --> 2599.94
already present

2600.3 --> 2606.579
including in America it's ridiculous to

2603.94 --> 2608.98
start fracking it is just destroying the

2606.579 --> 2611.6800000000003
environment it should be forbidden in my

2608.98 --> 2613.66
opinion for Pure environmental reasons

2611.68 --> 2614.319
which in this case are real it's not

2613.66 --> 2616.54
because

2614.319 --> 2619.06
um we don't need more oil no it's

2616.54 --> 2621.7599999999998
because fracking itself is extremely

2619.06 --> 2623.619
damaging to the environment

2621.76 --> 2625.6600000000003
you're literally

2623.619 --> 2629.1400000000003
pumping

2625.66 --> 2631.68
like poison in the ground it's really

2629.14 --> 2631.68
[ __ ] up

2635.26 --> 2644.28
and you don't freaking need it oil wells

2638.94 --> 2644.28
refill themselves over time

2646.78 --> 2651.42
where did your job if the road behind no

2655.599 --> 2661.3
and it won't

2657.819 --> 2664.3
I've got plenty of like uh minor

2661.3 --> 2666.76
telekinetic activity going around but

2664.3 --> 2669.46
nothing's gonna fall off you've got to

2666.76 --> 2671.92
basically build up some serious sin

2669.46 --> 2674.859
tension in order for that [ __ ] to happen

2671.92 --> 2676.859
so in that sense I'm totally not

2674.859 --> 2679.24
surprised

2676.859 --> 2683.0789999999997
would have experienced something like

2679.24 --> 2685.4799999999996
that because that guy is psycho

2683.079 --> 2687.28
and he knows things and has seen things

2685.48 --> 2691.26
and does things

2687.28 --> 2691.26
that are evil

2691.54 --> 2696.46
right and just because he's okay with

2694.42 --> 2699.42
that doesn't mean that the spirit world

2696.46 --> 2699.42
is okay with that

2706.74 --> 2709.9399999999996
[Music]

2720.599 --> 2729.1600000000003
hello Dan good to see you

2724.06 --> 2729.16
oh ilko done it I

2740.76 --> 2750.42
[Music]

2747.46 --> 2753.52
think blood of the Earth

2750.42 --> 2756.88
well Echo done it I mean

2753.52 --> 2758.44
that's one of the ideas that oil is the

2756.88 --> 2762.579
blood

2758.44 --> 2765.339
but logically I'd say it isn't literally

2762.579 --> 2767.619
the blood because blood then then there

2765.339 --> 2769.72
would have to be like channels of oil

2767.619 --> 2772.1800000000003
everywhere right that's what blood is

2769.72 --> 2774.7599999999998
the transport

2772.18 --> 2778.48
it's like a highway the your blood

2774.76 --> 2780.099
vessels are a highway for nutritions

2778.48 --> 2783.359
and for

2780.099 --> 2786.819
garbage dump right

2783.359 --> 2789.7
delivered nutritions and oxygen and take

2786.819 --> 2794.14
away the the byproduct of every cell

2789.7 --> 2795.5789999999997
basically well oil is obviously not that

2794.14 --> 2800.46
right

2795.579 --> 2800.46
however maybe it is

2803.619 --> 2810.4
you see what do we use oil for right

2808.02 --> 2813.52
greasing skids

2810.4 --> 2817.7200000000003
in the motor so all the parts move

2813.52 --> 2821.079
easily fluidly nothing starts to warp

2817.72 --> 2823.48
right that's what we use oil for and of

2821.079 --> 2824.98
course refine it for gasoline

2823.48 --> 2827.859
well

2824.98 --> 2829.54
maybe that is actually the function have

2827.859 --> 2830.56
you ever thought of that maybe it is

2829.54 --> 2834.94
there

2830.56 --> 2834.94
like a grease to

2835.66 --> 2840.339
I don't know

2837.339 --> 2841.96
I don't know exactly why then but

2840.339 --> 2844.66
to

2841.96 --> 2848.2
somehow Grease

2844.66 --> 2849.339
places in the earth that maybe when

2848.2 --> 2852.0989999999997
there's like

2849.339 --> 2854.619
a terrestrial shift earth-shifting

2852.099 --> 2857.76
earthquakes that it kind of like

2854.619 --> 2860.92
stabilizes it or makes sure that

2857.76 --> 2862.3
doesn't like break or so I I don't know

2860.92 --> 2864.88
this is kind of

2862.3 --> 2866.92
rough speculation of course well of

2864.88 --> 2869.02
course saying that oil is the blood of

2866.92 --> 2871.599
the earth is also rough speculation but

2869.02 --> 2875.14
that wouldn't make a lot of sense as to

2871.599 --> 2878.8
what blood is really functioning for

2875.14 --> 2881.859
in the design of the body right

2878.8 --> 2884.98
but if it were more like the

2881.859 --> 2887.92
like the special oily stuff

2884.98 --> 2890.38
it's really focused like in in your

2887.92 --> 2893.7400000000002
ligaments like to keep it smooth right

2890.38 --> 2896.8
maybe it's like that that would make a

2893.74 --> 2899.02
lot more sense for oil now wouldn't it

2896.8 --> 2899.98
right and since the Earth does kind of

2899.02 --> 2903.04
move

2899.98 --> 2905.98
maybe it's there to make sure that it

2903.04 --> 2907.7799999999997
doesn't like well

2905.98 --> 2910.48
freeze

2907.78 --> 2912.9
maybe it's there to yeah to keep things

2910.48 --> 2915.94
smooth and that it can keep moving

2912.9 --> 2919.1800000000003
instead of freezing up I don't know this

2915.94 --> 2922.9
is very rough speculation but

2919.18 --> 2924.04
based on that idea the analogy of that

2922.9 --> 2927.1800000000003
these

2924.04 --> 2931.2
situations on the Earth are like a

2927.18 --> 2931.2
microcosm of a life form

2932.5 --> 2938.02
and I think that in if you would see the

2935.2 --> 2941.7
Earth like that that oil would be more

2938.02 --> 2941.7
logical to be a lubricant

2941.859 --> 2949.18
like

2943.9 --> 2953.56
the oil in our ligaments to keep

2949.18 --> 2954.8799999999997
yeah to keep our limbs moving smoothly

2953.56 --> 2957.88
right

2954.88 --> 2957.88
pragmatic

2959.02 --> 2963.46
right because otherwise also if it's

2961.119 --> 2967.839
blood well that means that oil would

2963.46 --> 2972.0
literally have to be everywhere

2967.839 --> 2976.02
as in Big Subterranean channels right

2972.0 --> 2976.02
blood channels it's it's

2976.3 --> 2980.38
but oil well there isn't that's not how

2978.7 --> 2982.18
it's distributed on the earth there's

2980.38 --> 2983.52
certain places where it's really oil

2982.18 --> 2987.1189999999997
rich

2983.52 --> 2990.04
and then right

2987.119 --> 2991.839
giant swaths where there's nothing

2990.04 --> 2993.7599999999998
or barely anything and then another

2991.839 --> 2997.56
place where oh there's really rich here

2993.76 --> 3000.3
well if that's that local then it's

2997.56 --> 3002.52
universally illogic to compare it with

3000.3 --> 3007.1600000000003
blood because you need blood everywhere

3002.52 --> 3007.16
in an organism for it to be functional

3007.74 --> 3010.52
right

3015.34 --> 3021.559
[Music]

3021.96 --> 3028.38
if anything is blood

3025.619 --> 3029.46
then it's the water

3028.38 --> 3031.6800000000003
right

3029.46 --> 3033.42
the water's everywhere

3031.68 --> 3036.2
in the ground

3033.42 --> 3036.2000000000003
in the ocean

3037.68 --> 3043.02
Rivers

3039.06 --> 3046.44
a river is like the best analogy for

3043.02 --> 3049.68
a vein you could have there's even like

3046.44 --> 3052.079
picture comparisons right of the Amazon

3049.68 --> 3055.2
from high above and then comparing that

3052.079 --> 3057.42
to how a vein structure looks

3055.2 --> 3058.3999999999996
yeah because that's a much better

3057.42 --> 3061.599
analogy

3058.4 --> 3061.599
[Music]

3069.119 --> 3073.5
and there's water in US of course all

3071.579 --> 3076.5
life

3073.5 --> 3076.5
foreign

3081.93 --> 3087.519
[Music]

3096.54 --> 3100.339
anyway that was interesting

3103.38 --> 3108.059
I like it when that happens somebody

3105.0 --> 3110.88
brings up like an idea like that whoa is

3108.059 --> 3113.099
the blood in the Earth because I used to

3110.88 --> 3114.839
think that too like

3113.099 --> 3116.76
a decade ago

3114.839 --> 3119.46
I had a

3116.76 --> 3122.579
been confronted with that analogy of the

3119.46 --> 3124.98
yeah the Earth mother being lit not

3122.579 --> 3127.02
without the ridiculous Gaia Spirit

3124.98 --> 3130.14
nonsense right

3127.02 --> 3133.8
the cultishness but definitely like just

3130.14 --> 3135.96
the micro macro Cosmos As Above So Below

3133.8 --> 3138.48
and to see the Earth and everything that

3135.96 --> 3140.04
is on it as if it is an organism that

3138.48 --> 3142.8
has

3140.04 --> 3145.14
well like a bodily function

3142.8 --> 3147.1800000000003
and oil being the blood of the Earth was

3145.14 --> 3149.7
something that was regularly said has

3147.18 --> 3152.54
been set for a long time it's like an

3149.7 --> 3152.54
esoteric or

3152.94 --> 3159.359
metaphorical idea

3155.94 --> 3161.16
that pops up with people naturally it's

3159.359 --> 3164.22
a natural thing people bump into when

3161.16 --> 3165.24
they start thinking about it but yeah I

3164.22 --> 3168.18
thought

3165.24 --> 3169.14
a lot more about it and this is the

3168.18 --> 3174.0
result

3169.14 --> 3175.859
right blood is probably not oil

3174.0 --> 3178.92
the blood of the Earth

3175.859 --> 3181.2599999999998
it's that's probably water oil is

3178.92 --> 3182.76
probably much more likely to be a

3181.26 --> 3186.059
lubricant

3182.76 --> 3188.88
for terrestrial motions

3186.059 --> 3191.6400000000003
just like the special fatties that are

3188.88 --> 3192.839
in our ligaments

3191.64 --> 3195.9
to make

3192.839 --> 3197.819
our Limbs and all that and our back

3195.9 --> 3200.339
right

3197.819 --> 3201.7799999999997
be able to move smoothly without

3200.339 --> 3204.66
freezing up

3201.78 --> 3207.8390000000004
it's much more likely and also literally

3204.66 --> 3211.14
the substance well that's what we use it

3207.839 --> 3213.96
for in machines so

3211.14 --> 3217.14
if it has that natural ability

3213.96 --> 3219.0
then you should assume that that is what

3217.14 --> 3221.72
it's there for then

3219.0 --> 3221.72
wouldn't you

3224.25 --> 3227.36
[Music]

3227.839 --> 3231.7799999999997
see these from above look like circuit

3230.4 --> 3234.059
boards

3231.78 --> 3237.38
yeah well I mean circuit boards are

3234.059 --> 3237.38
designed for

3237.839 --> 3242.18
yeah think about it like what are

3240.3 --> 3246.059
circuit boards really

3242.18 --> 3249.8999999999996
it's a logistic system it's an electric

3246.059 --> 3251.88
logistic system right so it's all roads

3249.9 --> 3255.059
the shortest route the most efficient

3251.88 --> 3258.7200000000003
layout it's like perfect City Planning

3255.059 --> 3261.2400000000002
that's like a circuit board right

3258.72 --> 3263.7599999999998
based on what is possible

3261.24 --> 3267.0
etc etc and so there's like Super Micro

3263.76 --> 3270.3590000000004
Systems now like that but effectively it

3267.0 --> 3275.04
is about logistics of electrics

3270.359 --> 3278.0989999999997
so it's only logical that cities when

3275.04 --> 3280.98
viewed from far above kinda remind us of

3278.099 --> 3283.98
circuit boards because well

3280.98 --> 3283.98
Logistics

3284.48 --> 3290.599
the same priorities upon design

3292.02 --> 3296.579
I mean both are made by men both are

3294.42 --> 3300.119
designed by men cities

3296.579 --> 3301.46
and circuit boards so they have the same

3300.119 --> 3304.92
priorities

3301.46 --> 3308.099
effective Logistics

3304.92 --> 3311.1800000000003
and so yeah similar patterns will emerge

3308.099 --> 3311.1800000000003
it's only logical

3312.54 --> 3317.54
do you think computer chips is following

3315.3 --> 3317.54
no

3320.579 --> 3325.2000000000003
I don't think so

3323.22 --> 3326.339
I think microelectronics are quite

3325.2 --> 3329.0589999999997
unique

3326.339 --> 3329.0589999999997
like that

3330.839 --> 3337.98
and I think that in some other form

3334.859 --> 3340.5
there might have been I mean there might

3337.98 --> 3343.14
have been like Spirit technology yeah

3340.5 --> 3344.64
but that just gets so weird and highly

3343.14 --> 3348.2999999999997
speculative

3344.64 --> 3350.5789999999997
but Electronics as we have now which is

3348.3 --> 3353.819
basically a simulacrum it's like a

3350.579 --> 3355.02
program it's an artificial Electric

3353.819 --> 3359.52
thing

3355.02 --> 3361.619
like a electronic Golem in a way and I

3359.52 --> 3364.68
think that that is quite unique I think

3361.619 --> 3365.6400000000003
it has been envisioned for a very long

3364.68 --> 3368.5989999999997
time

3365.64 --> 3368.5989999999997
by people

3369.0 --> 3375.96
but I I'm quite sure it's it's rather

3372.66 --> 3379.04
unique to like the last

3375.96 --> 3379.04
100 years

3386.819 --> 3392.2799999999997
right

3389.16 --> 3395.819
it's just I don't think anybody before

3392.28 --> 3400.1400000000003
that time even considered scaling it

3395.819 --> 3402.3
down would make it better you see

3400.14 --> 3404.94
that's like this unique property of

3402.3 --> 3407.1600000000003
electronics gets smaller all the time

3404.94 --> 3409.2000000000003
gets cheaper all the time

3407.16 --> 3411.359
it's a famous saying I don't remember

3409.2 --> 3413.04
who that was but

3411.359 --> 3415.5589999999997
it's true

3413.04 --> 3418.319
and that is quite unique for electronics

3415.559 --> 3422.1600000000003
because well every other engineering

3418.319 --> 3424.52
field that usually doesn't apply

3422.16 --> 3424.52
right

3434.52 --> 3439.74
it's the micro factor that has made it

3437.04 --> 3442.16
so possible and it's quite unique to

3439.74 --> 3442.16
this time

3444.3 --> 3451.02
I mean you have to realize that

3447.02 --> 3455.52
the Insight on microscopics and

3451.02 --> 3457.14
microscopes as a tool are not that old

3455.52 --> 3459.72
they're really not like thinking

3457.14 --> 3461.5789999999997
microscopes are at best like 300 years

3459.72 --> 3462.72
old maybe more like in the direction of

3461.579 --> 3464.1600000000003
200

3462.72 --> 3466.6189999999997
somebody could

3464.16 --> 3469.5
look it up on Wikipedia but it's not

3466.619 --> 3473.339
that old and before that time people

3469.5 --> 3476.54
simply didn't even have a conception of

3473.339 --> 3476.54
a micro world like that

3479.7 --> 3484.5
it was all fantasy

3482.7 --> 3488.7599999999998
if any

3484.5 --> 3490.68
so that Micro World realization that the

3488.76 --> 3492.42
world can be microscopic and that

3490.68 --> 3493.6189999999997
there's still things happening there and

3492.42 --> 3497.3
functioning

3493.619 --> 3497.3
that's relatively new

3497.579 --> 3502.579
yeah that didn't exist like a thousand

3499.98 --> 3502.579
years ago

3503.52 --> 3508.14
that idea

3504.96 --> 3510.54
because there was no interest really no

3508.14 --> 3511.98
like what now what what are you talking

3510.54 --> 3514.319
about

3511.98 --> 3519.2
use whatever you see with your eyes

3514.319 --> 3519.2
exist really that was the standard right

3521.18 --> 3526.339
1644 oh wow

3523.38 --> 3526.339
that's pretty early

3527.04 --> 3534.96
right so it is more like 300 years then

3531.48 --> 3537.359
or 350.

3534.96 --> 3540.299
something yeah

3537.359 --> 3543.38
a long time ago I guess still but not

3540.299 --> 3543.38
from ancient times

3544.559 --> 3547.88
and I mean

3549.359 --> 3554.5789999999997
what was the microscope even used for in

3552.059 --> 3556.5
that time frame was it

3554.579 --> 3559.28
for biology

3556.5 --> 3562.02
or was it simply like hey we can now

3559.28 --> 3564.1800000000003
look yeah look look at things really

3562.02 --> 3565.92
small and they weren't really thinking

3564.18 --> 3568.68
about biology

3565.92 --> 3571.559
maybe they stumbled upon biology because

3568.68 --> 3573.68
of the microscope I don't know

3571.559 --> 3573.6800000000003
thank you

3599.4 --> 3604.92
yeah by the way Only the Lonely I think

3602.94 --> 3607.319
it's funny you call them Dutch I'm not

3604.92 --> 3609.33
sure if that if the Netherlands was even

3607.319 --> 3611.579
a country yet back then

3609.33 --> 3612.67
[Music]

3611.579 --> 3614.94
look that up

3659.28 --> 3663.9
that's not very straightforward easily

3661.68 --> 3667.02
easy to find

3663.9 --> 3669.0
just one a year when was it officially

3667.02 --> 3672.18
founded

3669.0 --> 3674.359
so it's stuff about modern times what is

3672.18 --> 3674.359
this

3688.88 --> 3694.6400000000003
wow Wikipedia that's very disappointing

3706.02 --> 3710.54
I would think it would be right there at

3708.18 --> 3710.54
the start

3720.599 --> 3722.839
foreign

3723.24 --> 3726.859
wait maybe this is it

3736.5 --> 3741.839
but uh yeah yeah I think I found the

3739.26 --> 3744.5400000000004
History part wow this is actually a

3741.839 --> 3747.319
pretty big article

3744.54 --> 3751.04
uh

3747.319 --> 3751.04
I think I found it

3761.339 --> 3766.5789999999997
right of course the the con the

3767.16 --> 3773.94
the region existed much longer than that

3770.839 --> 3776.18
uh hold on sorry for taking so long with

3773.94 --> 3776.18
this

3776.339 --> 3779.339
foreign

3818.4 --> 3821.4
foreign

3828.42 --> 3832.11
okay let's get back to the chat to see

3830.339 --> 3833.94
if you're still there

3832.11 --> 3838.1400000000003
[Music]

3833.94 --> 3839.88
it seems like it's the 16th century

3838.14 --> 3843.48
I'm kind of embarrassed because I used

3839.88 --> 3844.7400000000002
to actually have history in school and

3843.48 --> 3848.839
now that

3844.74 --> 3848.839
year it totally eludes me

3883.44 --> 3888.859
right so in the 16 I think it's yeah

3885.839 --> 3888.859
16th century

3889.02 --> 3895.079
but it's not like oh this is the year

3892.44 --> 3898.2000000000003
it's not super straightforward

3895.079 --> 3901.6800000000003
like in this piece telling me exactly

3898.2 --> 3904.2799999999997
when it is but yeah 16th century so okay

3901.68 --> 3904.2799999999997
I guess

3905.76 --> 3912.5
what July

3908.28 --> 3912.5
6 20 what oh

3919.2 --> 3924.1189999999997
I'm I'm literally gonna search that

3922.079 --> 3926.76
freaking day because

3924.119 --> 3928.7400000000002
I want to see it I want to see it in a

3926.76 --> 3932.48
damn Wikipedia already

3928.74 --> 3932.4799999999996
why can't I just find it

3940.799 --> 3943.4
right

3944.64 --> 3950.0989999999997
it was snowed under a bunch a whole

3947.16 --> 3953.2799999999997
bunch of elaborate wording here you're

3950.099 --> 3953.28
right 1581.

3961.799 --> 3965.599
that's longer than I expected

3967.619 --> 3970.46
foreign

3985.38 --> 3988.76
way to say that

4001.4 --> 4006.26
right anyway

4003.619 --> 4009.02
digging through some history here what

4006.26 --> 4011.96
the hell was I talking about

4009.02 --> 4013.7599999999998
are we talking about that guy that

4011.96 --> 4016.839
invented the microscope who was

4013.76 --> 4016.8390000000004
apparently Dutch

4020.68 --> 4025.48
yeah but that was in The Next Century

4045.859 --> 4048.5789999999997
foreign

4057.28 --> 4061.88
it did say that it was like during the

4059.78 --> 4064.099
80-year war that's something that's like

4061.88 --> 4066.7400000000002
really hammered in History Class here

4064.099 --> 4069.579
because that was very important

4066.74 --> 4069.5789999999997
period

4071.0 --> 4074.619
very interesting period

4075.079 --> 4080.48
so we were basically

4078.68 --> 4085.839
the king of Spain

4080.48 --> 4085.839
was well trying to conquer us

4085.88 --> 4089.48
and that's really when the Netherlands

4087.799 --> 4092.859
well resisted

4089.48 --> 4092.859
for freaking 80 years

4092.9 --> 4097.279
and then after that ended gained

4095.66 --> 4100.219
independence

4097.279 --> 4103.120000000001
or declared independence to be more

4100.219 --> 4103.12
precise so yeah

4105.02 --> 4108.279
16th century

4109.68 --> 4112.89
[Music]

4117.679 --> 4123.759
are the microscopes right but what were

4120.62 --> 4123.759
they used for though

4123.799 --> 4129.44
only lonely

4127.219 --> 4131.679
I mean I'm pretty sure that those early

4129.44 --> 4135.139999999999
microscopes were not used for like

4131.679 --> 4138.259
laboratory purposes for biology right

4135.14 --> 4142.64
they were probably used to

4138.259 --> 4146.96
be able to see how accurate

4142.64 --> 4148.58
gem is cut or something this is really I

4146.96 --> 4152.199
don't know but

4148.58 --> 4152.199
that's what I could think of

4152.42 --> 4159.88
it right

4154.46 --> 4159.88
gem cutting for figuring out the details

4184.279 --> 4189.92
look at my fan art

4187.279 --> 4192.040000000001

4322.52 --> 4324.6990000000005
out

4329.239 --> 4337.239

4346.1 --> 4351.6990000000005

4399.38 --> 4406.42
I mean

4401.719 --> 4406.42
his front name sounds pretty dewy

4410.179 --> 4417.04
that's first name so

4412.82 --> 4417.04
it probably was a bit of a grambler

4420.14 --> 4424.6990000000005
I could make a very inappropriate joke

4422.36 --> 4426.38
as to why he needed to invent that

4424.699 --> 4431.32
microscope

4426.38 --> 4431.32

4457.88 --> 4463.219
right but yeah there's a good chance

4459.739 --> 4466.218999999999
that indeed he probably did also use the

4463.219 --> 4469.54
microscope for his counterfeiting then

4466.219 --> 4469.54
just kind of hilarious

4472.64 --> 4477.4400000000005
throughout history

4475.159 --> 4481.659

4477.44 --> 4481.659
has gotten involved in right

4484.88 --> 4489.04

4491.96 --> 4496.94

4500.9 --> 4504.86

4504.86 --> 4510.38

4507.679 --> 4512.9
they're not malevolent they're actually

he actually invented the microscope

4539.5 --> 4550.239
being in you because he just needed to

4546.02 --> 4550.2390000000005
like be able to show

to his wife that he actually was a man

4558.5 --> 4562.94
needed a microscope to prove that it

4560.6 --> 4565.54
actually was there

4562.94 --> 4565.54
okay

4567.92 --> 4573.92
I'm only making this joke under the

4570.26 --> 4576.38
presumption that he is very Dutch

4573.92 --> 4579.38
okay

4576.38 --> 4579.38
foreign

4581.36 --> 4590.869
no not actually but you know what I mean

4584.01 --> 4590.869000000001
[Music]

4605.98 --> 4609.28
hilarious though

4621.5 --> 4628.06
yeah I think so too we're only lonely

4625.4 --> 4628.0599999999995
Professor film

4628.4 --> 4632.5599999999995
I think like 10 minutes behind or

4630.44 --> 4632.5599999999995
something

4643.159 --> 4648.219
if that was true the agents would invent

4646.04 --> 4648.219
it

4657.75 --> 4660.81
[Music]

4671.42 --> 4674.3
yeah but that's not entirely Fair

4673.159 --> 4677.599999999999
because

4674.3 --> 4680.3
all like to them it's not small

4677.6 --> 4683.54
they all have that dick size most of

4680.3 --> 4686.6
them right so they wouldn't need to they

4683.54 --> 4689.239
would be used to it in the Netherlands I

4686.6 --> 4692.0
mean we still had like a like a farmer

4689.239 --> 4693.5
culture and stuff

4692.0 --> 4696.14
nope

4693.5 --> 4698.239
devours the Boon

4696.14 --> 4701.179
right well they don't have do not have

4698.239 --> 4703.58
Micro penises but there were also plenty

4701.179 --> 4706.1
of Jews right I mean we freaking

4703.58 --> 4709.239
invented banking crying out loud the

4706.1 --> 4711.34
Netherlands why do you think that is

4709.239 --> 4715.94
Jews

4711.34 --> 4718.46
but yeah they well are not well endowed

4715.94 --> 4722.299999999999
typically

4718.46 --> 4724.46
right compared to big blonde Dutch

4722.3 --> 4725.719
farmer men

4724.46 --> 4728.06
so

4725.719 --> 4730.52
yeah then it becomes more of an issue

4728.06 --> 4732.1990000000005
because of the contrast right people

4730.52 --> 4734.659000000001
will be like what what's going on

4732.199 --> 4737.839999999999
because they're used to like I'm talking

4734.659 --> 4740.199
about women used to like oh yeah

4737.84 --> 4742.64
big Dutch [ __ ]

4740.199 --> 4747.199
uh well

4742.64 --> 4749.84
with him probably not so much and so the

4747.199 --> 4752.12
joke is that's why he invented the

4749.84 --> 4754.659000000001
microscope to actually prove to his wife

4752.12 --> 4758.0199999999995
that he was a man

4754.659 --> 4758.0199999999995
I don't know

4767.0 --> 4771.98
the joke meme about Internet Explorer

4769.76 --> 4774.08
what

4771.98 --> 4776.739
I don't remember that

4774.08 --> 4776.739
anyway

4779.36 --> 4784.46
[Music]

4794.54 --> 4798.82
oh okay right

4806.239 --> 4811.299999999999
I think the shot came when white men

4808.219 --> 4811.3
discovered Africa

4813.4 --> 4817.9
did you know that that's actually a myth

4819.5 --> 4824.6
like not all black people have huge

4823.04 --> 4827.6
[ __ ]

4824.6 --> 4827.6
but

4828.199 --> 4833.659
in this era

4830.54 --> 4837.44
more of those exist

4833.659 --> 4840.46
also because well they've been kind of

4837.44 --> 4840.46
bred for it

4840.739 --> 4843.739
bye

4843.8 --> 4847.159000000001

4845.36 --> 4850.299999999999

4847.159 --> 4850.299999999999
among others

4851.48 --> 4857.299999999999
and I don't know just people amongst

4854.239 --> 4859.459999999999
themselves it's like well we want the

4857.3 --> 4861.9400000000005
black one with the big [ __ ]

4859.46 --> 4865.0
for my insatiable wine

4861.94 --> 4867.379999999999
right I mean

4865.0 --> 4869.719
that's what I think I don't think all

4867.38 --> 4872.08
black people naturally have huge [ __ ]

4869.719 --> 4872.08
or anything

4873.92 --> 4878.9
but it's been like I guess popularized

4886.76 --> 4890.62
average is almost the same right

4890.719 --> 4894.38
because there's also just this weird

4892.76 --> 4898.04
thing about

4894.38 --> 4900.62
just the way you do things in life

4898.04 --> 4902.3
matter

4900.62 --> 4904.4
it's like

4902.3 --> 4907.76
okay this is getting into like very open

4904.4 --> 4910.639999999999
Benjamin style joke territory but

4907.76 --> 4913.64
there's a good chance that [ __ ] size

4910.64 --> 4914.110000000001
literally is a reflection of your

4913.64 --> 4916.719
character

4914.11 --> 4919.46
[Music]

4916.719 --> 4922.1
in that sense and

4919.46 --> 4924.38
like on average

4922.1 --> 4926.54
that like if you have a family where

4924.38 --> 4928.6990000000005
everybody's just being a total Grappler

4926.54 --> 4931.1
and like super anti-social always

4928.699 --> 4935.419999999999
whining always victim complaining that

4931.1 --> 4940.04
that will simply make the Cox shrink

4935.42 --> 4940.04
and like Mo like intergenerationally

4940.1 --> 4943.88
so if your dad's a total Grappler

4942.08 --> 4949.04
there's a good chance that your [ __ ]

4943.88 --> 4950.84
will have an less than average size

4949.04 --> 4953.54
foreign

4950.84 --> 4956.0
and this sounds like a joke but it might

4953.54 --> 4960.08
actually not be a joke

4956.0 --> 4963.08
it might actually be something to that

4960.08 --> 4963.08
right

4970.1 --> 4974.320000000001
have you seen the dicks on Greek art

4974.659 --> 4982.12
no no I don't really look at that

4977.6 --> 4982.120000000001
because I'm not gay yeah

4985.82 --> 4995.5599999999995
foreign

4988.1 --> 4995.56
[Music]

5007.679 --> 5015.46
the discoverers of Africa really

5013.12 --> 5020.5199999999995
and you think there is a historical

5015.46 --> 5020.52
record of the discovery of Africa

5021.1 --> 5024.280000000001
it's right next to it

5022.99 --> 5027.4
[Music]

5024.28 --> 5031.659
I mean dude

5027.4 --> 5033.4
there is no discovery of Africa

5031.659 --> 5036.82
I mean there might have been like oh

5033.4 --> 5038.679
let's go exploring Africa which we

5036.82 --> 5041.739
absolutely know is there and there's

5038.679 --> 5043.9
black people there and Arabs right they

5041.739 --> 5046.718999999999
knew that they became traveling there

5043.9 --> 5049.0
was black nobility and all that I mean

5046.719 --> 5052.4800000000005
black people were not like oh we

5049.0 --> 5055.6
discovered black people in Africa no

5052.48 --> 5058.98
that's ridiculous

5055.6 --> 5061.6
they didn't Discover it they just

5058.98 --> 5064.62
explored it and stumbled upon it and

5061.6 --> 5069.3
yeah maybe got a little Colonial

5064.62 --> 5069.3
right bring back this specimen

5069.34 --> 5074.26
there's been a time even that the thing

5071.44 --> 5077.5
is real where they really like tried to

5074.26 --> 5080.26
explore in Africa South America and then

5077.5 --> 5082.239
find interesting tribesmen and then like

5080.26 --> 5084.52
put them in a zoo

5082.239 --> 5087.28
in Europe

5084.52 --> 5089.4400000000005
like that actually did happen really

5087.28 --> 5092.08
freaky

5089.44 --> 5093.339999999999
but that was because of just the mindset

5092.08 --> 5095.14
because it was like oh we're gonna

5093.34 --> 5097.12
explore it oh look at all these new

5095.14 --> 5100.0
exotic things it was just interest for

5097.12 --> 5103.36
that and there was a lot of well wealth

5100.0 --> 5107.56
compared to before that time so they had

5103.36 --> 5110.259999999999
time for curiosity nonsense like that

5107.56 --> 5113.4400000000005
but Africa was not discovered I mean

5110.26 --> 5117.12
it's pretty much always been there

5113.44 --> 5117.12
throughout the beginning of time

5121.42 --> 5127.719
right so every time you see that oh like

5123.94 --> 5130.9
oh look like with explorers and and the

5127.719 --> 5133.179
weird hat right the colonial Hat Thing a

5130.9 --> 5136.42
lot of British typically are

5133.179 --> 5140.32
uh stereotype to be that type of figure

5136.42 --> 5143.5
to do that movies and all that so that's

5140.32 --> 5145.12
how it kind of sticks in memory for us

5143.5 --> 5148.84
When We're Young

5145.12 --> 5152.44
and see that yeah stuck to me but

5148.84 --> 5155.38
they did not Discover it

5152.44 --> 5158.259999999999
it's right there and they simply went

5155.38 --> 5160.659000000001
out and tried to explore find

5158.26 --> 5163.780000000001
interesting new

5160.659 --> 5166.0599999999995
places and tribes

5163.78 --> 5168.639
that before that time there was simply

5166.06 --> 5171.52
no interest because the only real

5168.639 --> 5174.04
interest was just oh can we trade can we

5171.52 --> 5176.56
make a quick profit

5174.04 --> 5178.9
no it's too much hassle well the [ __ ]

5176.56 --> 5181.320000000001
that then we're not going there

5178.9 --> 5184.739
right

5181.32 --> 5184.739
that came later

5185.38 --> 5188.86
or did it no wait that came before

5187.48 --> 5190.78
actually

5188.86 --> 5193.48
because during the Renaissance there was

5190.78 --> 5196.719
already like International Trade ships

5193.48 --> 5198.699
and also slaves but then later came like

5196.719 --> 5201.2390000000005
another exploration

5198.699 --> 5201.239
phase

5202.239 --> 5207.879999999999
the the real colonialization where they

5204.88 --> 5210.52
went out again

5207.88 --> 5212.08
that's also how you have even still some

5210.52 --> 5216.360000000001
of those

5212.08 --> 5216.36
very old black and white photographs

5217.48 --> 5221.44
but that's much later

5219.82 --> 5224.099999999999
right

5221.44 --> 5224.099999999999
I mean

5224.679 --> 5229.42
if there was any kind of official

5226.78 --> 5232.679
exploration of Africa like when the hell

5229.42 --> 5232.679
would have that have taken place

5232.9 --> 5237.659
I mean

5235.06 --> 5240.42
like Roman times

5237.659 --> 5244.0599999999995
pre-egyptian times I mean

5240.42 --> 5247.54
Egypt the Egyptian Empire was right

5244.06 --> 5250.2390000000005
there was like dominance I mean

5247.54 --> 5253.239
Africa did not have to be discovered it

5250.239 --> 5255.82
was kind of a dominant power there in

5253.239 --> 5258.159
Egypt so

5255.82 --> 5261.5199999999995
see

5258.159 --> 5263.92
I mean the discovery of Africa would

5261.52 --> 5266.860000000001
technically precede all our known

5263.92 --> 5268.659
historical knowledge

5266.86 --> 5270.82
right it's like one of the first thing

5268.659 --> 5273.58
that would have been discovered I mean

5270.82 --> 5275.08
and why why would you why would they do

5273.58 --> 5277.78
that

5275.08 --> 5279.639
why would they record it like I don't

5277.78 --> 5282.48
know

5279.639 --> 5282.4800000000005
ah

5297.82 --> 5302.04
That's What discovery means

5302.38 --> 5309.400000000001
well it's more that the ReDiscover then

5305.8 --> 5311.5
right just like America was rediscovered

5309.4 --> 5312.94
because it was pretty well known that

5311.5 --> 5314.98
was there

5312.94 --> 5319.0
but then they just wiped that history

5314.98 --> 5322.78
and said oh we're we've heard rumors

5319.0 --> 5326.04
that there is this continent to the west

5322.78 --> 5326.04
across the Atlantic

5326.38 --> 5329.52
let's claim it

5331.179 --> 5334.9
but they knew it was there it was

5333.639 --> 5337.6
already

5334.9 --> 5341.04
like there were peoples living there

5337.6 --> 5343.659000000001
fall sorts not just Native American

5341.04 --> 5344.92
Indians that are typically stereotyped

5343.659 --> 5346.719
now

5344.92 --> 5348.82
it was

5346.719 --> 5352.0
it had civilization

5348.82 --> 5355.139
it's just not peaking civilization it

5352.0 --> 5355.139
was kind of like already

5355.54 --> 5360.46
in a venerable stage that run its course

5358.78 --> 5363.04
A lot of it

5360.46 --> 5366.52
Powers declined and so there was this

5363.04 --> 5370.48
opportunity that the European kingdoms

5366.52 --> 5375.2390000000005
basically took and just started

5370.48 --> 5377.799999999999
getting in their faces and taking over

5375.239 --> 5382.599999999999
genocides and all

5377.8 --> 5386.26
but it was well known I was there I mean

5382.6 --> 5390.6990000000005
there was literally trade

5386.26 --> 5393.219
through like uh the Iceland and freeze

5390.699 --> 5396.759999999999
land route which was still there

5393.219 --> 5399.28
before it sank into the ocean

5396.76 --> 5401.38
there was no trade routes there even

5399.28 --> 5402.4
like throughout medieval times and

5401.38 --> 5404.92
before

5402.4 --> 5408.219
I think

5404.92 --> 5410.1990000000005
it wasn't like super crowded trade

5408.219 --> 5412.139
routes but there was just trade route

5410.199 --> 5414.879999999999
there were ships that were actually

5412.139 --> 5417.900000000001
going back and forth every now and then

5414.88 --> 5417.900000000001
there with stuff

5429.46 --> 5431.639
thank you

5434.8 --> 5441.58
and yeah thinking about it there's even

5438.639 --> 5445.42
there's even some chance that

5441.58 --> 5448.3
back then that there was even before the

5445.42 --> 5452.88
official exploration of America that

5448.3 --> 5452.88
there was already production there

5456.4 --> 5460.138999999999
food production perhaps

5463.0 --> 5467.34
what would have been clothes Maybe

5478.12 --> 5481.86
Dutch conquered yeah

5484.42 --> 5488.62
well conquering is even kind of a tough

5487.12 --> 5490.78
word they

5488.62 --> 5494.699
partially

5490.78 --> 5498.04
but we basically traded ourselves in

5494.699 --> 5501.419999999999
well we traded our way in

5498.04 --> 5501.42
the Dutch were not

5501.58 --> 5506.679
conquerors like for example Spain we

5504.4 --> 5509.92
were actually created

5506.679 --> 5512.4400000000005
almost as a counter response to the

5509.92 --> 5514.9
entire conquering attitude the

5512.44 --> 5518.5599999999995
conquestadors

5514.9 --> 5522.638999999999
of Spain which were brutal and genocidal

5518.56 --> 5524.38
and the Dutch word specifically not

5522.639 --> 5526.12
no you're not banned again George

5524.38 --> 5528.6990000000005
Sanford

5526.12 --> 5529.9
why are you saying that

5528.699 --> 5534.879999999999
right

5529.9 --> 5536.44
so to conquer we we just made trading

5534.88 --> 5539.139
posts and we

5536.44 --> 5542.919999999999
yeah we brought Commerce

5539.139 --> 5544.36
and hercuably even a little education

5542.92 --> 5547.96
here and there

5544.36 --> 5550.599999999999
right what we didn't force it

5547.96 --> 5553.9
like England would say like no you're

5550.6 --> 5557.26
now our culture we didn't do that and we

5553.9 --> 5559.36
didn't like well literally just turn all

5557.26 --> 5565.42
the locals into slaves

5559.36 --> 5569.08
or die like the Spanish we set up trade

5565.42 --> 5571.3
and exchange of information education

5569.08 --> 5573.04
all kinds of things special products

5571.3 --> 5575.159000000001
right because that's what you get then

5573.04 --> 5578.26
if you actually

5575.159 --> 5581.08
melee communication with like

5578.26 --> 5582.6990000000005
far remote tribes people they will also

5581.08 --> 5585.88
like I don't know

5582.699 --> 5587.5599999999995
maybe even share secrets their shamanic

5585.88 --> 5591.219
secrets and stuff there's all kinds of

5587.56 --> 5593.139
things you can get that the British and

5591.219 --> 5596.08
the Spanish wouldn't have gotten because

5593.139 --> 5598.4800000000005
they would just kill everybody or like

5596.08 --> 5600.88
force them to abandon their ways and

5598.48 --> 5604.659
become British nationalists

5600.88 --> 5606.639
right Dutch didn't have that issue

5604.659 --> 5609.78
because we weren't like that

5606.639 --> 5609.78
just trade

5610.96 --> 5618.78
and like Mutual exchange that was very

5614.92 --> 5618.78
much the mindset of the Dutch

5620.38 --> 5625.3
as we were going around and making all

5623.139 --> 5627.88
these trades trade posts forming the

5625.3 --> 5630.219
Dutch East Indian company and then later

5627.88 --> 5634.38
unfortunately that was taken over by the

5630.219 --> 5634.38
British and they kind of ruined it

5636.159 --> 5639.659
oh yeah

5640.36 --> 5647.5599999999995
they they reformed how the the yeah the

5644.98 --> 5649.839999999999
procedures were and it wasn't as free

5647.56 --> 5652.26
anymore because of the British when they

5649.84 --> 5652.26
took over

5653.98 --> 5657.82
and everything was dragged in that

5656.08 --> 5661.36
because yeah it was about the network

5657.82 --> 5664.239
the Trade Network and whoever controls

5661.36 --> 5667.0599999999995
that sets the policy so even if like

5664.239 --> 5670.718999999999
colonies like Indonesia were still very

5667.06 --> 5674.860000000001
much Dutch they were still subjected to

5670.719 --> 5676.44
the new policies of the English

5674.86 --> 5680.46
tray company

5676.44 --> 5680.46
that got control see

5695.199 --> 5700.659
so yeah I kind of resent that word

5698.139 --> 5705.36
professor philbel of conquered

5700.659 --> 5705.36
because we didn't really do it like that

5705.79 --> 5710.22
[Music]

5712.6 --> 5719.02
I mean the Dutch would have had also

5715.9 --> 5720.759999999999
just very hostile Encounters of peoples

5719.02 --> 5722.620000000001
that are just like no you're of the West

5720.76 --> 5725.1990000000005
we're gonna kill you all and then yeah

5722.62 --> 5728.5599999999995
we would have gone badass

5725.199 --> 5732.159
War mode against those

5728.56 --> 5735.6990000000005
right but never as like as a Revenge oh

5732.159 --> 5740.62
well let's kill all these people then

5735.699 --> 5744.58
it's just no take out opponents that are

5740.62 --> 5746.679
opposing themselves as as hostile

5744.58 --> 5749.92
opponents and

5746.679 --> 5752.4400000000005
try to befriend and trade with the ones

5749.92 --> 5754.679
that I don't have that

5752.44 --> 5754.678999999999
right

5759.1 --> 5764.52
man today shows all over the place I

5761.139 --> 5764.52
have no idea what to title is

5778.84 --> 5781.08
foreign

5782.639 --> 5785.9400000000005
still here

5797.92 --> 5801.09
[Music]

5808.6 --> 5815.26
you got your hands full

5812.26 --> 5815.26
okay

5823.54 --> 5828.76
between 808 what why why do you think

5827.5 --> 5830.62
that

5828.76 --> 5832.06
I mean there's a good chance that they

5830.62 --> 5835.3
basically

5832.06 --> 5839.38
a thousand years were made up

5835.3 --> 5841.62
but I always thought that was like more

5839.38 --> 5841.62
between

5842.4 --> 5846.179
500 and 1500

5851.02 --> 5856.3
and was simply like stretched a thousand

5853.78 --> 5857.98
years apart and then things that

5856.3 --> 5860.320000000001
actually happened in a much shorter time

5857.98 --> 5863.379999999999
span just kind of spread out

5860.32 --> 5866.199
split apart

5863.38 --> 5869.7390000000005
something like that

5866.199 --> 5872.259999999999
but I mean like this period

5869.739 --> 5875.62
of the Dutch

5872.26 --> 5878.02
I think that's pretty real

5875.62 --> 5880.659
we didn't just like subtly out of

5878.02 --> 5883.120000000001
nowhere pop up and

5880.659 --> 5885.219
and do all that we we have that history

5883.12 --> 5888.4
it has shaped us

5885.219 --> 5890.02
it shaped our culture

5888.4 --> 5892.659
and are like

5890.02 --> 5895.0
International identity even I mean now

5892.659 --> 5896.92
it's become very different and we're

5895.0 --> 5900.699
much more like globalist minded more

5896.92 --> 5900.6990000000005
gooey but

5900.76 --> 5906.04
I mean that history is that history I do

5903.159 --> 5908.5599999999995
believe that the rough outlining of that

5906.04 --> 5912.6
did happen

5908.56 --> 5912.6
don't think that was just made up

5917.139 --> 5920.139
foreign

5944.93 --> 5948.339
[Music]

5948.4 --> 5951.0
foreign

6006.54 --> 6011.76
right by the way

6008.78 --> 6013.139
if that actually did happen yeah and

6011.76 --> 6016.400000000001
then I'm probably gonna run out but

6013.139 --> 6016.400000000001
thinking about it you know

6018.12 --> 6023.78
it's really weird that a

6021.06 --> 6023.780000000001
post

6023.88 --> 6031.139
of Christ Roman Emperor would do such a

6028.5 --> 6034.86
thing and split the times apart when

6031.139 --> 6036.36
that was already done I think well in

6034.86 --> 6040.98
the time when

6036.36 --> 6044.46
Rome had already become Christian right

6040.98 --> 6046.5599999999995
then it's really weird maneuver

6044.46 --> 6050.52
to suddenly put

6046.56 --> 6052.620000000001
well the religion on which your Empire

6050.52 --> 6055.26
is now resting

6052.62 --> 6058.219
to suddenly move that a thousand years

6055.26 --> 6058.219
into the past

6058.32 --> 6065.58
that would weaken it

6061.76 --> 6068.34
right I mean is if it's your religion

6065.58 --> 6071.219
it's like your state religion

6068.34 --> 6074.1
then wouldn't you actually want to be

6071.219 --> 6076.44
closer to when he was really there

6074.1 --> 6079.8
so it's it's always been kind of an odd

6076.44 --> 6083.4
like if that happened like why would

6079.8 --> 6086.639
they do it unless they actually

6083.4 --> 6089.4
only assimilate it is as a gesture to

6086.639 --> 6092.900000000001
basically calm everybody down and they

6089.4 --> 6092.9
wanted to forget about it because

6093.0 --> 6097.44
if you're gonna insert a thousand years

6095.639 --> 6099.7390000000005
of History

6097.44 --> 6103.5
in between

6099.739 --> 6105.78
you and Jesus Christ that's going to in

6103.5 --> 6108.139
the story and in people's minds that

6105.78 --> 6111.719
actually fall for that trick

6108.139 --> 6114.4800000000005
weaken their relation because it's like

6111.719 --> 6116.46
a thousand years ago now

6114.48 --> 6118.799999999999
there's even a saying about this oh

6116.46 --> 6121.139
that's like a thousand years ago like

6118.8 --> 6124.02
it's so long ago right yesterday so so

6121.139 --> 6127.9800000000005
long ago it's like a thousand years ago

6124.02 --> 6130.5
that's a mindset right it's like oh it's

6127.98 --> 6132.78
so far away from me it has very real

6130.5 --> 6134.34
relation with me because I choose to

6132.78 --> 6136.86
think of it like that because it's just

6134.34 --> 6140.2390000000005
so long ago

6136.86 --> 6140.239
so it's weird

6171.78 --> 6174.5
hmm

6175.08 --> 6180.84
anyway

6177.0 --> 6182.82
I hope I made you all think I mean

6180.84 --> 6184.08
the entire hangout has not been like

6182.82 --> 6187.5599999999995
very

6184.08 --> 6189.6
consistent as subject-wise

6187.56 --> 6192.06
but I did like

6189.6 --> 6194.76
dig up a couple of interesting Notions

6192.06 --> 6197.400000000001
that maybe will make you think

6194.76 --> 6198.84
and hey that's that's what I really want

6197.4 --> 6201.5599999999995
right that's what I'm trying to do

6198.84 --> 6201.56
Awakening

6201.96 --> 6207.9
we give up

6204.78 --> 6212.54
show you little things that you probably

6207.9 --> 6212.54
wouldn't have actually spotted

6213.42 --> 6219.4800000000005
right anyway I'm rounding out

6216.96 --> 6221.82
thanks everyone for coming I hope you

6219.48 --> 6224.339999999999
like this show if you did then please

6221.82 --> 6226.32
don't forget the rogans it up and if you

6224.34 --> 6228.54
haven't already subscribe to my channel

6226.32 --> 6230.639
and hit the Bell notification so you

6228.54 --> 6232.619
know when I'm going live which is

6230.639 --> 6234.719
normally 1pm Amsterdam time in a

6232.619 --> 6237.0599999999995
weekdays and 2PM Amsterdam time in the

6234.719 --> 6239.58
weekend and please also do support me

6237.06 --> 6241.7390000000005
through the PayPal patreon and the

6239.58 --> 6243.719
membership system join button that'll be

6241.739 --> 6245.099999999999
much appreciated I can always use

6243.719 --> 6249.42
support

6245.1 --> 6251.219
really like what I'm doing then please

6249.42 --> 6253.38
keep supporting me

6251.219 --> 6255.679
so that yeah

6253.38 --> 6259.8
don't end up like

6255.679 --> 6262.02
desperate again and like I need it now

6259.8 --> 6264.96
because that's not fun because then I

6262.02 --> 6267.119000000001
have less room to basically dig up these

6264.96 --> 6269.159
subtle little things as I was doing

6267.119 --> 6272.639
today

6269.159 --> 6275.699
and I hope that you would prefer that

6272.639 --> 6278.6990000000005
me doing this instead of being really

6275.699 --> 6281.638999999999
desperate for funding so yeah please do

6278.699 --> 6283.86
keep the support coming anyway I'll be

6281.639 --> 6287.159000000001
