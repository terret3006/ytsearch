background seem to have are covered with

81.0 --> 88.23

145.06 --> 155.41
yeah good to see you all that's

148.7 --> 155.41
Wednesday yeah I had a very interesting

157.06 --> 168.98
day yesterday although don't think yeah

165.769 --> 179.15
it didn't it was all it was all online

168.98 --> 181.22
it was all leather and stuff so but yeah

179.15 --> 184.12
I it was weird because I kind of forget

181.22 --> 189.97
to make a lot of notes again what I did

184.12 --> 192.019
because yeah it was just non-stop

189.97 --> 195.5
conversations almost like almost known

192.019 --> 197.81
stuff was the Flat Earth debate lasted

195.5 --> 205.01
very long the after show was like almost

197.81 --> 206.989
two hours and to that Owen Benjamin was

205.01 --> 210.019
pretty good although it he had a work a

206.989 --> 211.79
lot of delays and oh yeah the during

210.019 --> 215.36
that also I kind of got to know my

211.79 --> 218.06
roommate a little bit better because

215.36 --> 220.579
she's yeah a lot on the balcony they are

218.06 --> 224.06
smoking too and I'm smoking there and

220.579 --> 226.549
I'm just over overhearing conversations

224.06 --> 229.7
that she's having with other friends and

226.549 --> 233.34
kind of what she does and all that

229.7 --> 237.75
I'm not gonna detail her it my analysis

233.34 --> 239.70000000000002
so far you know it's it's her life but

237.75 --> 244.23
she does seem to mix in with kind of

239.7 --> 249.42
like a generic liberal types and she's

244.23 --> 252.81
into sports and exercising seems but

249.42 --> 255.61999999999998
also yeah plenty about the she's into

252.81 --> 260.34
joints and beer and all that too so I

255.62 --> 264.6
don't know I think she's probably a

260.34 --> 269.25
pretty nice person not my type

264.6 --> 271.44
but she's still pretty nice and yeah

269.25 --> 273.9
I've had better connection with her than

271.44 --> 278.55
most of the other girls in previous

273.9 --> 286.169
roommate situations so yeah that's okay

278.55 --> 290.22
um anyway ordering on Benjamin and then

286.169 --> 292.14
after that a ball busters and I should

290.22 --> 294.47900000000004
have known it's like wait what live ball

292.14 --> 297.24
busters show what is this oh wait it's

294.479 --> 300.18
Tuesday but wasn't that Monday no it was

297.24 --> 303.15000000000003
Tuesday damn alright so I just went on

300.18 --> 307.41
there and it was pretty it was a great

303.15 --> 310.79999999999995
show really good I don't know who's seen

307.41 --> 313.68
it but it was really awesome and I was

310.8 --> 317.01
very glad to be a part of it and able to

313.68 --> 318.84000000000003
do put down a couple of things that that

317.01 --> 322.34999999999997
connected and other people kind of went

318.84 --> 324.03
with it and I'm yeah I'm gonna gladly

322.35 --> 325.62
listen back to it I haven't listened

324.03 --> 333.419
back to the show yet but it was really

325.62 --> 336.479
good and yeah after that was over I kind

333.419 --> 339.75
of stuck around in chat or in another in

336.479 --> 342.69
the chat but in the discord panel and I

339.75 --> 345.83
had a hour conversation with a Kumu

342.69 --> 349.89
virus after that pretty much one on one

345.83 --> 352.78999999999996
really personal conversation and like

349.89 --> 355.83
he's a really nice guy like really nice

352.79 --> 357.87
it was kind of weird that at the end yet

355.83 --> 360.19
to kind of like I had to confirm like

357.87 --> 362.44
wait are you a globe or your

360.19 --> 368.86
clover right and he was like yeah he

362.44 --> 372.31
loves the globe loves it but yeah it's

368.86 --> 376.57
obvious that it's just a more a feeling

372.31 --> 378.25
and yeah anyway apparently yeah I think

376.57 --> 383.89
he's been in my chat to here and there

378.25 --> 386.53
he's a pretty cool guy but yeah kind of

383.89 --> 388.45
funny and the good conversation he

386.53 --> 391.39
apparently he is very interested in what

388.45 --> 394.63
I do on my show the way I described

391.39 --> 397.06
things processes spiritual things he has

394.63 --> 400.78
a good appreciation for that so that was

397.06 --> 403.18
good to hear it's funny that I yeah

400.78 --> 407.46999999999997
that's not just flat earthers that's

403.18 --> 410.94
good well enough policy changes coming

407.47 --> 410.94000000000005
down the track locally oh dear

413.91 --> 418.09000000000003
right Missouri Barry yeah that was a

416.02 --> 424.62
topic on Owen Benjamin yesterday wasn't

418.09 --> 424.61999999999995
it just the the the church situation

424.86 --> 431.66900000000004
yeah I have to dress this on my show

427.51 --> 439.27
plenty of times think Sunday even

431.669 --> 442.47999999999996
elaborately well it's good yeah and then

439.27 --> 444.34
there was this other VI I forgot to make

442.48 --> 448.12
him noted that it was kind of weird

444.34 --> 451.92999999999995
I was getting weirder and weirder but

448.12 --> 455.52
yeah new earth you know the the Russian

451.93 --> 458.14
sounding lady with this special voice

455.52 --> 461.04999999999995
some people find it annoying I find it

458.14 --> 463.33
kind of cute but yeah she talks a lot

461.05 --> 468.63
about while shamanic and spiritual

463.33 --> 474.07
things and what is it at the name and

468.63 --> 476.56
she was putting down a subject yesterday

474.07 --> 479.61
in Airstream and she just uploads things

476.56 --> 479.61
so there's no live stream

480.909 --> 488.12
yeah that was kind of weird

482.96 --> 493.69899999999996
basically yeah she said that that the

488.12 --> 497.93
heads of the Catholic Church and certain

493.699 --> 501.08000000000004
Islam leaders or planning to make like a

497.93 --> 503.629
murderer religion and she was then

501.08 --> 505.60999999999996
basically from that presupposition on

503.629 --> 507.34900000000005
putting down like yeah how would that

505.61 --> 511.939
effectively work was pretty damn scary

507.349 --> 516.38
and that she said and like this is yeah

511.939 --> 519.0500000000001
I don't know if like to me I'm accepting

516.38 --> 522.279
it as speculation but I thought that

519.05 --> 525.17
like the the way she put it down yeah

522.279 --> 527.36
that might actually turn out to be kind

525.17 --> 533.75
of like that no and she does have like

527.36 --> 536.269
these sources she's very serious but

533.75 --> 539.12
yeah I don't know how literal I should

536.269 --> 543.2
take it all but still like the idea of

539.12 --> 545.3
okay there might be this icon figure and

543.2 --> 547.73
if you want to have an official religion

545.3 --> 551.329
then you must have that icon in there

547.73 --> 558.0500000000001
and that kind of in a way references

551.329 --> 560.3
back to biblical scenarios from way back

558.05 --> 563.63
even because they did that in their way

560.3 --> 567.829
to like you have to have this as part of

563.63 --> 569.959
your religion or it's not allowed so

567.829 --> 572.0
yeah that yeah one-world religion that's

569.959 --> 577.6099999999999
that was the subject of her video there

572.0 --> 582.23
and yeah do you find it somewhat

577.61 --> 584.779
worrisome but it's all in the theme I

582.23 --> 588.5
guess it's really this [Â __Â ] is about to

584.779 --> 592.9399999999999
happen or something with religion like

588.5 --> 595.209
this and yeah I guess it's all the talk

592.94 --> 595.2090000000001
now

597.4 --> 602.379
[Applause]

599.24 --> 602.379
[Music]

603.01 --> 608.5
sci-fi series that I talked about yes

605.69 --> 608.5
that's Firefly

629.78 --> 639.62
I'll flag this one it's like that ship

634.78 --> 641.9
is pretty much that is the stage it's

639.62 --> 644.48
like most of the show is in that ship

641.9 --> 647.72
and it's like it's a real place they

644.48 --> 650.03
made it like in there's a afterward

647.72 --> 652.37
documentary about the making off and

650.03 --> 654.62
they show it they show like this is a

652.37 --> 659.47
real place it's like a total building

654.62 --> 659.47
that they made that's pretty fascinating

678.19 --> 685.3900000000001
that's nothing else stuff in here

682.029 --> 685.39
so yeah

686.37 --> 691.55
all right I definitely I bet you like it

693.2 --> 699.8900000000001
[Music]

694.67 --> 699.89
I'll see if it's on fire stick

719.42 --> 723.4399999999999
well I'll stay in 8012

721.28 --> 725.2099999999999
look if you think he's delusional then

723.44 --> 728.4200000000001
you just don't get it you don't

725.21 --> 730.88
understand what he's doing he's creating

728.42 --> 734.06
comedy in this father a sacred

730.88 --> 737.98
slaughterhouse fashion and that has

734.06 --> 742.51
certain demands of approach as it were

737.98 --> 749.0
so yeah you've may think it's delusional

742.51 --> 751.1
but it's it's not as delusional as you

749.0 --> 754.9
might think if you just get into it and

751.1 --> 754.9
if you understand what he's doing so

778.08 --> 785.37
called escapology or what what does that

783.01 --> 785.37
mean

799.9 --> 813.53
right anyway right yeah after that I

810.44 --> 815.5400000000001
kind of went to bed because I yeah I was

813.53 --> 818.27
up pretty late with conversations you

815.54 --> 822.79
know and like I had a pretty long day

818.27 --> 825.9499999999999
yesterday overall and so this morning I

822.79 --> 827.2099999999999
did wake up didn't feel all that easy I

825.95 --> 831.11
don't know it could be the weather you

827.21 --> 834.61
know because it went like this like I'm

831.11 --> 837.14
not literally sick but it's just like my

834.61 --> 842.59
intestines were slightly upset somehow

837.14 --> 846.26
it happens sometimes feel okay now and I

842.59 --> 848.6600000000001
after before on the show I went on the

846.26 --> 852.4399999999999
Emma UK discord server have a

848.66 --> 855.35
conversation with the guys Bev and chemo

852.44 --> 858.86
and sleeping warrior and a couple of

855.35 --> 862.28
others and yeah they there's an

858.86 --> 864.53
interesting plan I kind of contributed

862.28 --> 868.03
to it I think somebody else I'm not

864.53 --> 870.5899999999999
gonna spoil it just yet but it has to do

868.03 --> 872.93
with what was already talked about on

870.59 --> 874.76
the debate yesterday about fight the

872.93 --> 879.89
Flat Earth in the situation with the

874.76 --> 886.28
glass maker and all that and yeah this

879.89 --> 890.42
might get very interesting Oh Missouri

886.28 --> 893.899
Baron is really

890.42 --> 893.899
that's ridiculous

912.4 --> 921.02
right yeah hojae

916.04 --> 923.68
even he's not delusional he isn't and he

921.02 --> 928.5799999999999
he like constantly tests the water like

923.68 --> 932.0899999999999
he checks out what his comedy does to

928.58 --> 933.7700000000001
people also you know and the funny thing

932.09 --> 938.21
is that in all the groups that he

933.77 --> 940.5799999999999
supposedly attacked attacks like there's

938.21 --> 945.95
a lot of fans in every category that

940.58 --> 949.97
follow him that are among that or as you

945.95 --> 956.23
would X squirters and yeah they love

949.97 --> 956.23
that [Â __Â ] instead of rock or no it's not

969.31 --> 983.9699999999999
Oh men wear flowers behind my ears Oh

981.64 --> 983.97
God

996.1 --> 1005.3100000000001
now you know I don't say like dude 1 you

1002.91 --> 1009.39
need to wear a mask right well just go

1005.31 --> 1011.52
there in a hazmat suit do it right it'll

1009.39 --> 1013.47
freak people out but it's like yeah hey

1011.52 --> 1019.79
you're talking about a virus right well

1013.47 --> 1022.6800000000001
this is actually what you need huh huh

1019.79 --> 1025.199
yeah a stupid little surgeon mask don't

1022.68 --> 1028.29
work this is what works then you go in

1025.199 --> 1034.3200000000002
with your hazmat suit in like yeah good

1028.29 --> 1036.6
luck out there maybe that's a bad idea I

1034.32 --> 1039.1699999999998
don't know it's just they can't do

1036.6 --> 1041.2199999999998
anything about it because you're right

1039.17 --> 1043.02
hypothetically if there is such a thing

1041.22 --> 1050.49
as a virus like that

1043.02 --> 1053.48
so our SAS gas mask yeah it's still very

1050.49 --> 1053.48
uncomfortable though

1070.93 --> 1083.5600000000002
right I don't know I don't think a

1073.55 --> 1083.56
hazmat suits are particularly cheap hmm

1087.32 --> 1092.2
a in a koala

1097.86 --> 1109.6499999999999
a lot of garbage bags Oh God but you do

1107.52 --> 1116.1
rise that will look like absolutely

1109.65 --> 1119.48
idiotic though right just like the guy

1116.1 --> 1126.48
who had a plastic bottle on his head

1119.48 --> 1128.28
that's just yeah you know you can get

1126.48 --> 1130.38
all creative who knows you know like go

1128.28 --> 1132.66
there in your Darth Vader suit if you

1130.38 --> 1135.8300000000002
got one there's probably people out

1132.66 --> 1139.44
there doing that they're like the

1135.83 --> 1141.36
Famicom types that have their suits that

1139.44 --> 1146.429
have their stormtrooper suits or Darth

1141.36 --> 1151.799
Vader day yeah they could do that if

1146.429 --> 1155.21
they want to do although it's probably a

1151.799 --> 1158.79
bit of a hassle to constantly do that

1155.21 --> 1161.91
anyway I you know I've never wore a mask

1158.79 --> 1162.45
this entire year I'm not gonna wear a

1161.91 --> 1165.8400000000001
mask

1162.45 --> 1168.299
I haven't been forced or like excluded

1165.84 --> 1169.37
from any place because I haven't worn a

1168.299 --> 1172.62
mask

1169.37 --> 1174.9899999999998
so although yeah there have been a lot

1172.62 --> 1178.5
of places closed but not places that I

1174.99 --> 1182.16
went to so yeah effectively it hasn't

1178.5 --> 1183.929
even affected me other than through

1182.16 --> 1186.23
media and people talking about it

1183.929 --> 1186.23
constantly

1187.73 --> 1192.14
dick nose mask oh God

1195.95 --> 1200.89
yep and that's good hojae they should be

1224.299 --> 1226.929
yeah

1229.75 --> 1236.169
yeah our Prime Minister is getting a lot

1232.539 --> 1239.98
of flack and it's good he should because

1236.169 --> 1245.23
he's just playing around the country at

1239.98 --> 1247.84
this point he knows it he's a self

1245.23 --> 1250.3600000000001
gratified nail grappler he has yeah it

1247.84 --> 1258.34
just he always has that smile on his

1250.36 --> 1260.35
face but yeah people are sick of Kuro

1258.34 --> 1262.09
new nonsense here especially and we

1260.35 --> 1264.549
haven't even been hit but it's just like

1262.09 --> 1266.08
very blatantly obvious like yeah if we

1264.549 --> 1268.98
do that it's gonna damage the economy

1266.08 --> 1271.87
you're not gonna do that like that and

1268.98 --> 1274.8700000000001
then there's the whole farmer situation

1271.87 --> 1277.0
they where they yeah they they put the

1274.87 --> 1279.639
military there to stop the produce just

1277.0 --> 1282.25
what the [Â __Â ] and they're getting

1279.639 --> 1284.529
screwed over and apparently there's this

1282.25 --> 1288.19
whole thing going now it's kind of what

1284.529 --> 1289.389
I've superficially been from a distance

1288.19 --> 1291.19
kind of getting out of it

1289.389 --> 1293.32
is that there's apparently this plan to

1291.19 --> 1296.259
just literally turn the Netherlands into

1293.32 --> 1300.73
a giant city-state because they want a

1296.259 --> 1303.6100000000001
million more people in here and yeah

1300.73 --> 1304.96
that's a pretty small country okay so

1303.61 --> 1306.399
they basically want to get rid of the

1304.96 --> 1309.669
farmers and just turn it all into

1306.399 --> 1312.9399999999998
housing situations everything and it is

1309.669 --> 1315.429
a money scam it is basically like yeah

1312.94 --> 1318.1000000000001
it makes a lot of money builds [Â __Â ] it

1315.429 --> 1321.6390000000001
looks good on the economy yay and then

1318.1 --> 1326.139
afterward everybody is [Â __Â ] because we

1321.639 --> 1330.039
can't make around food anymore so it's

1326.139 --> 1334.269
it's a horrific idea and like the

1330.039 --> 1336.94
problem when you go building on land it

1334.269 --> 1338.889
kind of destroys the land you can't yeah

1336.94 --> 1342.3700000000001
even if you would take it all away again

1338.889 --> 1344.649
which is like giant costs on its own you

1342.37 --> 1348.639
can't just easily reuse the land again

1344.649 --> 1351.4899999999998
for farming so it's it's very bad idea

1348.639 --> 1354.84
and my personal opinion it really has to

1351.49 --> 1359.409
be stopped but really it's got to stop

1354.84 --> 1362.7389999999998
[Â __Â ] has got to stop and I think a lot

1359.409 --> 1366.999
of people agree in the Netherlands

1362.739 --> 1371.029
you know the farmers local farmers means

1366.999 --> 1374.57
survival and self-reliance at least for

1371.029 --> 1376.789
the nation and this is just a terrible

1374.57 --> 1380.989
idea I don't want the Netherlands to

1376.789 --> 1385.33
become like a giant San Francisco

1380.989 --> 1387.289
city-state that's the worst idea ever

1385.33 --> 1389.4789999999998
worst idea ever

1387.289 --> 1392.389
because yeah everything that's happening

1389.479 --> 1395.3590000000002
over there that's gonna go over here as

1392.389 --> 1404.4189999999999
well and then what yeah then we're all

1395.359 --> 1407.32
[Â __Â ] so there's that no I guess you

1404.419 --> 1407.3200000000002
already moved on

1424.27 --> 1430.1299999999999

1426.23 --> 1437.6
my god are you dense buddy it's a

1430.13 --> 1439.8100000000002
freakin joke don't you get it what are

1437.6 --> 1439.81
you

1443.52 --> 1448.65
on Benjamin loses any credibility with

1446.28 --> 1451.44
me when he says any military with guns

1448.65 --> 1453.8090000000002
guarding Antarctic and penguins waddle

1451.44 --> 1457.02
because they are too close to the edge

1453.809 --> 1465.87
of the earth it's it's a freakin joke

1457.02 --> 1469.22
man for [Â __Â ] sake dude just I can't

1465.87 --> 1472.4599999999998
believe you don't see that don't you see

1469.22 --> 1472.46
it's like

1496.09 --> 1503.08
like you got you gotta realize he is

1499.4 --> 1509.48
talking comedy he is not being a

1503.08 --> 1511.1
scientist okay or a engineer a wooden

1509.48 --> 1514.52
pension is not a scientist or an

1511.1 --> 1519.08
engineer he's a comedian what he's gonna

1514.52 --> 1522.2
put down is gonna be favoring comedic

1519.08 --> 1525.4099999999999
effect over technical correctness and

1522.2 --> 1526.94
it's gonna go and he's gonna go play

1525.41 --> 1528.8000000000002
with the angles to it that's what he

1526.94 --> 1534.14
does it's what a comedian does you can

1528.8 --> 1536.57
just think that he's yeah being

1534.14 --> 1538.46
absolutely technically correct like

1536.57 --> 1541.1
that's the primary importance or

1538.46 --> 1547.1200000000001
anything no no it might be on like

1541.1 --> 1547.12
health advice and [Â __Â ] you know but

1552.4 --> 1557.3000000000002
right yes Roger he is a smart comedian

1555.53 --> 1560.57
and he improvises his stuff you know

1557.3 --> 1562.6399999999999
most comedians standup they don't even

1560.57 --> 1566.8999999999999
improvise they write all their jokes and

1562.64 --> 1573.65
then they stick to it no oh and he makes

1566.9 --> 1576.14
it on the spot a lot of it and then he

1573.65 --> 1580.01
expand then he basically uses what he

1576.14 --> 1584.5700000000002
devised and builds on that into a more

1580.01 --> 1587.24
refined joke program as it were that's

1584.57 --> 1590.09
how he does it it's very admirable and

1587.24 --> 1591.63
incredible that he that he can keep this

1590.09 --> 1594.6989999999998
up for so long

1591.63 --> 1594.699
[Music]

1606.52 --> 1611.34
yeah daddy Antarctic Treaty

1618.26 --> 1626.809
come on stallion 8012 you know that has

1623.87 --> 1633.29
been mentioned since 2015 the Antarctic

1626.809 --> 1637.99
Treaty it's there it's real it doesn't

1633.29 --> 1641.75
necessarily say why it's there like or

1637.99 --> 1645.38
rather the given reasons are blatantly

1641.75 --> 1651.04
obviously nonsensical but it doesn't

1645.38 --> 1655.6000000000001
necessarily apply the edge or a dome

1651.04 --> 1655.6
it's just like no you can't go there

1665.76 --> 1669.56
okay Cleary what

1690.82 --> 1696.1
now a gem the food life

1699.58 --> 1710.279
but close and yeah don't don't go all

1707.559 --> 1710.279
caps again

1736.14 --> 1738.7700000000002
yeah

1747.56 --> 1753.47
yeah but look if you're gonna get all

1750.86 --> 1758.03
big and capital letter

1753.47 --> 1760.3700000000001
don't capital capitalized god it's wrong

1758.03 --> 1763.58
don't do that it's you're making a

1760.37 --> 1768.08
mistake when you do that but yeah it's

1763.58 --> 1770.84
about life and hey food is a is a

1768.08 --> 1773.6599999999999
concept without life it doesn't mean

1770.84 --> 1779.1799999999998
anything doesn't exist so life is first

1773.66 --> 1782.3300000000002
then comes sustenance and everything

1779.18 --> 1786.16
that keeps the cycle of life going but

1782.33 --> 1786.1599999999999
it is life primary

1804.97 --> 1811.92
okay Bob Richard Theodore Cletus if you

1809.8 --> 1814.96
say so

1811.92 --> 1817.5900000000001
but the ice story said to the contrary

1814.96 --> 1822.79
because there's been people that were

1817.59 --> 1824.77
with their boat going to places where

1822.79 --> 1827.44
they were being told no you can't go

1824.77 --> 1831.45
there they were stopped and even

1827.44 --> 1834.25
arrested that was in the newspaper so I

1831.45 --> 1838.3600000000001
don't know if what you're saying is

1834.25 --> 1841.57
completely correct because yeah maybe

1838.36 --> 1846.9299999999998
officially civilians can go there but

1841.57 --> 1849.49
only under strict control and guide and

1846.93 --> 1852.94
you can't go everywhere and that's been

1849.49 --> 1856.3
testified by many people you know you

1852.94 --> 1858.31
can go to this spot at Antarctica but

1856.3 --> 1860.23
then yeah at a certain point they'd just

1858.31 --> 1862.06
tell you know you're not a lot they're

1860.23 --> 1864.55
gonna stand in front of you with a gun

1862.06 --> 1870.9099999999999
saying or whatever they know you know

1864.55 --> 1873.6299999999999
this is as far as you go they don't

1870.91 --> 1876.19
allow you to go beyond certain points

1873.63 --> 1878.2900000000002
now for whatever reason you know they

1876.19 --> 1879.64
could say it's for your own safety blah

1878.29 --> 1882.67
blah blah but they're simply not

1879.64 --> 1888.91
allowing you to continue on so yeah what

1882.67 --> 1891.04
you said it's not correct and who knows

1888.91 --> 1896.2
they may be saying okay civilian

1891.04 --> 1899.43
expeditions but that's only a cover it's

1896.2 --> 1903.6100000000001
still gonna be condoned by a military

1899.43 --> 1906.7
back drop thing that's gonna allow that

1903.61 --> 1908.4399999999998
to appear like it's perfectly allowed

1906.7 --> 1910.6000000000001
it's not though you can't just

1908.44 --> 1915.24
improvising Lee go there and just start

1910.6 --> 1915.24
things they don't allow you to do that

1916.23 --> 1923.88
you have to coordinate with them

1920.309 --> 1923.8799999999999
you know that right

1936.4 --> 1950.46
need a mask the fitted Antartica I don't

1946.57 --> 1953.8899999999999
think having a mask would be a bad thing

1950.46 --> 1958.3500000000001
in Antarctica like a good one with good

1953.89 --> 1962.8300000000002
glasses and maybe a mask with separate

1958.35 --> 1964.9199999999998
pressurized air that isn't so terribly

1962.83 --> 1964.9199999999998
cold

1974.1 --> 1979.35
Oh God stallion if you're gonna push

1977.4 --> 1980.7
double down on this [Â __Â ] I'm gonna time

1979.35 --> 1983.34
you out just getting really annoying

1980.7 --> 1987.05
here didn't you get it

1983.34 --> 1991.31
it was a joke it's a joke to trigger

1987.05 --> 1994.9199999999998
ballers don't you get that stallion

1991.31 --> 1999.6299999999999
that's why he said it he said penguin

1994.92 --> 2013.46
nonsense edge to trigger you don't you

1999.63 --> 2014.42
get it yeah blah blah blah blah blah

2013.46 --> 2022.03
that's [Â __Â ]

2014.42 --> 2022.03
Bob Richard it's just a lie

2030.99 --> 2036.929
yeah whilst le in 82f I don't care about

2033.929 --> 2040.38
the treaty the setup is blatantly

2036.929 --> 2043.289
obvious the scenario is there people

2040.38 --> 2046.1100000000001
have gone and they testify to what

2043.289 --> 2049.05
happened how they were restricted

2046.11 --> 2051.33
effectively it doesn't matter if it

2049.05 --> 2054.139
doesn't say that in the freakin treaty

2051.33 --> 2054.139
it is what is happening

2094.01 --> 2098.389
yeah [Â __Â ] off

2144.28 --> 2151.98
that star in a jar manipulated frequency

2148.51 --> 2157.2400000000002
heavenly light well no I don't think so

2151.98 --> 2164.35
although it is kind of a hint that light

2157.24 --> 2165.1899999999996
can manifest electrically in such a

2164.35 --> 2167.92
fashion

2165.19 --> 2170.05
but yeah the problem is that's a local

2167.92 --> 2171.58
phenomena you can actually the star in

2170.05 --> 2173.6800000000003
the jar approach it there's no

2171.58 --> 2175.99
holographic element to that started here

2173.68 --> 2178.56
it's literally a little local light

2175.99 --> 2181.87
within the jar that's manifesting and

2178.56 --> 2184.15
yeah the heavenly bodies globe of the

2181.87 --> 2187.8599999999997
heavens is not that is holographic it's

2184.15 --> 2187.86
not those are not local lights

2196.04 --> 2200.5
but it is an interesting phenomena I

2198.14 --> 2200.5
agree

2243.69 --> 2251.31
ships take people to the southern area

2246.24 --> 2258.4199999999996
why don't we see video footage I don't

2251.31 --> 2266.2999999999997
know don't you I think they do show

2258.42 --> 2266.3
footage it's just not land in words

2270.95 --> 2279.68
what Cleary he denied refraction what

2276.619 --> 2289.04
type that he deny terrestrial refraction

2279.68 --> 2291.6189999999997
or actual fraction which one Leary yes

2289.04 --> 2297.68
it's true Oh Guns of Navarone the

2291.619 --> 2301.15
attacked and and I'd just one person

2297.68 --> 2301.1499999999996
usually I think

2313.17 --> 2317.819
but you're right like the as far as I

2316.38 --> 2321.6600000000003
can remember there's always one troll

2317.819 --> 2324.0
coming in every day at least once see

2321.66 --> 2325.8289999999997
and now he changed the sock account into

2324.0 --> 2329.609
this and they know because he appeared

2325.829 --> 2331.44
just say oh hello like not even a minute

2329.609 --> 2334.95
after I banned the other guy so it's the

2331.44 --> 2337.319
same guy see and now he's asking

2334.95 --> 2352.47
ridiculous questions so you know yeah

2337.319 --> 2355.829
that's exactly what the other one did he

2352.47 --> 2363.3799999999997
denied to the inferior Mirage hides the

2355.829 --> 2367.25
bottom of boats okay then he didn't deny

2363.38 --> 2372.75
refraction he denied diffraction the

2367.25 --> 2376.789
bottom-up concealment effect that is

2372.75 --> 2380.13
inherent to to sight and perspective

2376.789 --> 2383.9700000000003
that's not refraction refraction is the

2380.13 --> 2387.599
thing that blurs up what you see at the

2383.97 --> 2391.529
end of your effective sight due to air

2387.599 --> 2395.88
conditions diffraction is is the side

2391.529 --> 2399.269
effect due to lens just to the nature of

2395.88 --> 2401.5190000000002
lenses themselves that causes ya things

2399.269 --> 2405.1189999999997
way in the distance to become concealed

2401.519 --> 2411.8999999999996
after the effective horizon after the

2405.119 --> 2418.339
optical slant point is where refraction

2411.9 --> 2421.559
causes an inferior Mirage right well I

2418.339 --> 2423.779
guess yes yeah it's the displacement of

2421.559 --> 2427.4100000000003
the objects in relation to the horizon

2423.779 --> 2429.66
yes those are caused by refraction too

2427.41 --> 2436.2
and the end of sight is also caused by

2429.66 --> 2438.269
refraction but the effective well yeah

2436.2 --> 2440.96
yes yeah the ecom's bottom-up

2438.269 --> 2440.9599999999996
concealment

2442.109 --> 2448.519
that effect is caused by dye fraction

2445.049 --> 2451.95
and that always happens it's not a

2448.519 --> 2454.68
that's not a mirage in type effect

2451.95 --> 2456.95
it's just cut off cut off from the

2454.68 --> 2456.95
bottom

2471.63 --> 2474.35
hmm

2486.089 --> 2492.959
but yeah ballers denying things would

2489.939 --> 2495.64
have foreseen it you know at this point

2492.959 --> 2497.859
they're just denying everything even the

2495.64 --> 2500.739
most basic common sense I still remember

2497.859 --> 2502.569
that at one point just because it was

2500.739 --> 2508.41
politically convenient for him rumpus

2502.569 --> 2511.689
argued that and could also mean or

2508.41 --> 2517.39
remember that he actually tried to argue

2511.689 --> 2519.759
that and was kind of like cherry-picking

2517.39 --> 2522.64
it trying to cherry-pick that concept

2519.759 --> 2526.539
and into reifying that and could always

2522.64 --> 2529.3289999999997
also mean and and and or at this yeah

2526.539 --> 2532.3590000000004
this bizarre because this is what they

2529.329 --> 2536.319
do and there's yeah there's no need for

2532.359 --> 2539.519
them to hold back on any tear so they'll

2536.319 --> 2542.14
just flip everything upside down

2539.519 --> 2545.1989999999996
everything the most basic common

2542.14 --> 2546.4
sensical things and that's what they're

2545.199 --> 2548.109
going to do is they're gonna keep on

2546.4 --> 2551.7690000000002
doing that's just into complete

2548.109 --> 2554.819
buffoonery delusion what they do and

2551.769 --> 2554.819
they will get worse

2570.19 --> 2575.989
denying you say well you can't make a

2573.71 --> 2578.119
photo from a second law of

2575.989 --> 2582.4700000000003
thermodynamics violation it's just

2578.119 --> 2583.88
impossible then yeah where's that

2582.47 --> 2586.91
approach footage you know all these

2583.88 --> 2590.239
photos and all the yeah supposed to like

2586.91 --> 2594.019
where's the continuous shot earth ground

2590.239 --> 2596.42
level atmosphere level oh you can see

2594.019 --> 2597.799
the curve right it's a certain angle

2596.42 --> 2600.98
with the camera yeah yeah let's see that

2597.799 --> 2603.44
continued on until that curve turns into

2600.98 --> 2605.9
the ball earth beneath you in a

2603.44 --> 2613.64
continuous shot let's go where's that

2605.9 --> 2616.67
you know space program [Â __Â ] has been out

2613.64 --> 2621.68
there for 60 years so where's this

2616.67 --> 2627.38
continuous shot yeah you see the tiny

2621.68 --> 2629.359
ball that's why we deny pictures from a

2627.38 --> 2632.839
second law of thermodynamics violations

2629.359 --> 2634.339
to be reified into a real photograph

2632.839 --> 2636.109
which they are not

2634.339 --> 2639.0789999999997
they're always classified as images

2636.109 --> 2644.989
another little detail about that or that

2639.079 --> 2648.1090000000004
you forget why do we need why because

2644.989 --> 2651.65
it's evidence and how about actually

2648.109 --> 2655.839
calling it a photograph and not an image

2651.65 --> 2655.839
tiny wubble how about that

2667.2 --> 2676.3689999999997
oh wow really misery there sure 66 years

2672.75 --> 2676.369
old crazy

2719.24 --> 2727.5499999999997
cool Cleary oh oh that's something then

2725.33 --> 2732.62
at least no way to prove the globe that

2727.55 --> 2734.5600000000004
is well that that's admirable that he'd

2732.62 --> 2738.25
at least say that

2734.56 --> 2738.25
well done room if

2759.19 --> 2769.83
but the CIA refers to as not a Space

2762.28 --> 2769.8300000000004
Agency that's a good one

2787.57 --> 2793.6000000000004
all right yeah so J remember China's

2791.71 --> 2798.73
supposedly on the backside of the moon

2793.6 --> 2801.94
as we speak and Israel sent a I don't

2798.73 --> 2809.47
know a 3d simulation of a thing to the

2801.94 --> 2815.58
moon and it crashed remember that they

2809.47 --> 2815.58
did a virtual fields moon landing thing

2817.2 --> 2828.72
and then they proceeded to give up very

2820.54 --> 2828.72
quickly but yeah good actual and efforts

2831.45 --> 2834.5499999999997
[Music]

2861.91 --> 2869.7599999999998
well so in 92 NASA was 33 years old

2875.2 --> 2878.0099999999998
now wait

2878.69 --> 2883.96
now 2002 right

2888.76 --> 2895.4700000000003
no wait what getting my calculus is

2893.5 --> 2902.82
failing me

2895.47 --> 2902.8199999999997
96 yeah yeah it is 2002 all right

2917.55 --> 2921.3900000000003
all right that's interesting Guns of

2919.44 --> 2925.44
Navarone is there an official date for

2921.39 --> 2936.12
when they were formed did it happen to

2925.44 --> 2944.55
be on September 11 1958 I don't know

2936.12 --> 2947.83
just random maybe not that would be

2944.55 --> 2951.0
pretty messed up though

2947.83 --> 2951.0
[Music]

2961.829 --> 2967.579
maybe I'll look it up if you guys re uh

2968.359 --> 2976.989
it's got that nice I wiki come on wiki

2973.84 --> 2976.989
[Music]

2981.89 --> 2993.7799999999997
19:58 it doesn't say an exact date oh

2985.38 --> 2998.57
wait it does July 29 right so it's a

2993.78 --> 2998.57
little more than a month off all right

3039.73 --> 3050.83
ah yeah clear a Cleary felon bait well

3046.47 --> 3054.3689999999997
ten Tim Osman said that yeah that's very

3050.83 --> 3057.0699999999997
special then he doesn't trust the

3054.369 --> 3060.94
government about the virus but he does

3057.07 --> 3069.81
trust them about about the bother of the

3060.94 --> 3069.81
yeah he's probably not the only one

3089.31 --> 3095.93
Oh God Robin Stanley that's just

3093.57 --> 3095.9300000000003
terrible

3096.32 --> 3106.31
kanye west's this is bring us back to

3100.92 --> 3106.31
the moon oh my god

3112.33 --> 3124.24
that sounds so absolutely [Â __Â ] it

3116.1 --> 3130.54
just it might actually happen is they

3124.24 --> 3131.7999999999997
try if it ever get to that but yeah I

3130.54 --> 3133.06
don't know I don't think it's gonna

3131.8 --> 3141.34
happen I think they're just gonna

3133.06 --> 3147.52
postpone it forever or or or it'll be so

3141.34 --> 3152.02
ridiculous you know it'll be like I can

3147.52 --> 3154.12
imagine yeah I'm not finding this but if

3152.02 --> 3156.88
they tried that it could be like a whole

3154.12 --> 3160.66
Elon Musk type situation where it would

3156.88 --> 3164.44
just look even faker than the original

3160.66 --> 3167.79
moon landing like that if yeah if you

3164.44 --> 3170.86
can even imagine such a thing it's

3167.79 --> 3170.86
[Music]

3188.72 --> 3197.359
how does the moon-landing look fake it's

3191.9 --> 3201.38
a [Â __Â ] dude just they're like forget it

3197.359 --> 3204.339
there's forget it all again it is really

3201.38 --> 3208.27
like a spell induced amnesia isn't it

3204.339 --> 3212.41
come on tiny one ball have you actually

3208.27 --> 3217.119
watched Flat Earth videos that point out

3212.41 --> 3220.45
what is wrong with moon landing footage

3217.119 --> 3223.27
there's some really good ones out there

3220.45 --> 3228.3489999999997
just the lighting studio lighting

3223.27 --> 3231.2599999999998
shadows that make no sense for starters

3228.349 --> 3234.65
and then you're going to go get just the

3231.26 --> 3237.67
structural integrity of this this lunar

3234.65 --> 3241.52
lander thing is absolutely absurd and

3237.67 --> 3243.89
then the final straw when it takes off

3241.52 --> 3249.079
it's being filmed from the ground right

3243.89 --> 3253.46
in 69 level technology and how did they

3249.079 --> 3255.799
retrieve that really pretty sure yeah

3253.46 --> 3260.39
you couldn't just live on the spot send

3255.799 --> 3263.029
a digitized version of that over did

3260.39 --> 3266.23
this that makes no sense the whole thing

3263.029 --> 3266.23
is so ridiculous

3270.63 --> 3276.059
although it's still for the time being

3272.88 --> 3278.2490000000003
you know it was really impressive like

3276.059 --> 3283.799
if you see this on a miniature TV screen

3278.249 --> 3285.66
yeah I would be fascinated too but yeah

3283.799 --> 3289.549
now looking through it you can't be

3285.66 --> 3289.549
seriously believing that's real come on

3303.99 --> 3309.56
it is sort of annoying you think so

3306.81 --> 3309.56
random Explorer

3318.73 --> 3323.04
Oh what do you want to be banned or some

3320.83 --> 3323.04
wet

3327.18 --> 3331.1299999999997
dude what the [Â __Â ] is up with you

3336.53 --> 3339.3100000000004
step

3345.42 --> 3353.19
dude are you like multiple personality

3351.28 --> 3356.44
disorder or something random Explorer

3353.19 --> 3360.58
like you're not the guy I gave a wrench

3356.44 --> 3365.1
the other day you're just being a total

3360.58 --> 3365.1
dumbass right now what is going on here

3401.64 --> 3407.64
what are you talking about Hana koala

3404.56 --> 3407.64
where are you getting that from

3419.43 --> 3422.089
what

3425.14 --> 3431.97
who is that pretty sure that's not the

3429.369 --> 3431.9700000000003
real guy

3456.42 --> 3461.279
okay random explore that's fine but yeah

3459.299 --> 3467.67
this is assertions you made it kind of

3461.279 --> 3470.099
ridiculous I addressed the details of

3467.67 --> 3472.589
space why it's the second law of

3470.099 --> 3476.25
thermodynamics violation why it is

3472.589 --> 3478.17
highly dubious that over this long time

3476.25 --> 3480.779
period there is not a singular

3478.17 --> 3485.64
continuous shot from the Earth's surface

3480.779 --> 3488.88
to outside of the earth where it will

3485.64 --> 3490.7599999999998
transit into a ball in a singular shot

3488.88 --> 3493.289
it doesn't exist and it should it should

3490.76 --> 3496.38
absolutely that should be the primary

3493.289 --> 3500.46
evidence the silence flat earth forever

3496.38 --> 3502.44
and it should have been there and it

3500.46 --> 3504.42
should still be there that should be the

3502.44 --> 3506.339
thing that ballers should be rubbing in

3504.42 --> 3508.4700000000003
her face every single day we try

3506.339 --> 3512.519
anything it's like yeah here it is here

3508.47 --> 3515.069
it is here it is see yeah we got it

3512.519 --> 3516.8689999999997
that's why the earth is not flat because

3515.069 --> 3521.46
here's the proof the continual non-stop

3516.869 --> 3525.21
shot from the ground to the sky no

3521.46 --> 3528.359
suspicious fisheye lens needed and then

3525.21 --> 3530.039
ya see after a while it really does turn

3528.359 --> 3533.269
into a ball well there you go

3530.039 --> 3537.029
well where is it then where is it

3533.269 --> 3540.8089999999997
where's this this shot it must be there

3537.029 --> 3544.049
it must be there with all the money

3540.809 --> 3547.8900000000003
spent on this thing it's absolutely

3544.049 --> 3550.94
insane that there is no such footage

3547.89 --> 3550.94
it's insane

3563.15 --> 3570.08
yeah you know what the funniest thing is

3565.43 --> 3572.3599999999997
this footage does not exist either in

3570.08 --> 3575.6
science fiction they do the same thing

3572.36 --> 3580.46
there you know why because they can't do

3575.6 --> 3584.81
it they can't even simulate it it's that

3580.46 --> 3588.65
not real the mind can only be tricked up

3584.81 --> 3591.58
to a certain extent they can't make that

3588.65 --> 3596.51
shot they literally cannot do it because

3591.58 --> 3598.88
it will be too obvious to the mind that

3596.51 --> 3601.46
what they're looking at is absolutely

3598.88 --> 3603.86
fake and that's why they don't do that

3601.46 --> 3605.9900000000002
in science fiction movies even with the

3603.86 --> 3608.63
digital quality they have these days

3605.99 --> 3612.8599999999997
they don't do it ever it's for a good

3608.63 --> 3615.6400000000003
reason because they can't it should be

3612.86 --> 3617.27
there though but they don't even

3615.64 --> 3625.31
simulate it

3617.27 --> 3629.87
they don't even simulate this is it is

3625.31 --> 3632.63
it catching on yet anyway I'm gonna run

3629.87 --> 3634.52
out the show so thank you everyone for

3632.63 --> 3637.2200000000003
coming I hope you like to show I thought

3634.52 --> 3638.72

earlybird number 593 and I'm gonna join

3660.74 --> 3666.5299999999997
the Flat Earth debates right after this

3662.42 --> 3671.09
is just start up any second yeah hashtag

3666.53 --> 3674.27
meifa indeed Steve over Marco Amanda

3671.09 --> 3677.4700000000003
young and yeah until the next video

3674.27 --> 3677.47
keep it flat

3703.41 --> 3705.47
you
