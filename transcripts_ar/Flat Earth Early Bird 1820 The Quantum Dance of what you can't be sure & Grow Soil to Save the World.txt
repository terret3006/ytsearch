50.079 --> 55.0
good morning welcome to Flat Earth early

53.559 --> 58.399
bird number

55.0 --> 59.96
1820 I'm your host Arwin and before

58.399 --> 62.160000000000004

83.0 --> 88.159
keep it

84.479 --> 91.119
coming right

88.159 --> 96.759
so whether today

91.119 --> 96.759
is less windy that's first of

98.04 --> 103.88000000000001
all so it's a little bit calm down which

101.84 --> 107.799
is great

103.88 --> 111.399
because been so much wind and

107.799 --> 111.399
restlessness last night

116.399 --> 121.6
too

118.84 --> 123.71900000000001
right although it's not completely wind

121.6 --> 127.32
still I

123.719 --> 128.72
mean it's still going a bit just tone

127.32 --> 132.04
down a

128.72 --> 136.2
little but uh yeah mostly kind

132.04 --> 138.76
of thin layer of clouds up there you can

136.2 --> 141.76
see a bit of blue here and there in

138.76 --> 141.76
between but not

144.599 --> 147.599
much

148.36 --> 152.519
and yeah there's not a lot of rain in

150.84 --> 156.64000000000001
between there's a little bit here and

152.519 --> 156.64000000000001
there was at night especially

157.239 --> 162.68
but it all does seem to dry

160.28 --> 164.319
up relatively

162.68 --> 169.8
quickly

164.319 --> 169.79999999999998
no large amount of Puddles

171.28 --> 176.4
around

173.4 --> 176.4
right

177.0 --> 183.44
so it is Saturday the 30th of December

186.4 --> 191.20000000000002
2023 temperatures 9Â°

192.68 --> 195.68
C

196.519 --> 204.28
oh look like New Year's Eve is going to

199.599 --> 204.28
be rainy according to this

206.36 --> 211.68
forecast we'll

208.68 --> 211.68
see

214.72 --> 218.879
hello Tommy first in chat good to see

228.68 --> 236.87900000000002
you yeah it got a bit late last night

231.92 --> 236.879
but despite that I'm like super on

238.68 --> 245.799
time but oh man there was just so

242.4 --> 250.239
much interesting

245.799 --> 253.28
stuff I mean feed was really good and

250.239 --> 255.079
long it was like a 4our

253.28 --> 257.919
show

255.079 --> 261.23900000000003
and and after that ended still Neil was

257.919 --> 263.639
complaining how dare you like uh Neil

261.239 --> 267.28
was a 4our

263.639 --> 271.28000000000003
show but it was a good show very good

267.28 --> 273.63899999999995
and then uh yeah had a call or rather

271.28 --> 278.75899999999996
yeah I called my friend

273.639 --> 281.759
in that check how she was doing and that

278.759 --> 283.8
turned into like a great

281.759 --> 286.0
conversation really

283.8 --> 290.08
energizing I mean she is like in

286.0 --> 292.4
grieving though CU like potentially yeah

290.08 --> 293.96
one of her best friends died recently

292.4 --> 297.84
like really

293.96 --> 297.84
recently not even a month

298.16 --> 303.28000000000003
ago and yeah with the ancestral wind

301.08 --> 306.15999999999997
going and everything

303.28 --> 308.479
like she she was like it was like really

306.16 --> 311.96000000000004
sitting on her but she was dealing with

308.479 --> 315.639
it relatively well so I was discussing

311.96 --> 317.919
with her like yeah what my

315.639 --> 319.52
experiences right and everybody's

317.919 --> 322.0
experiences pretty much the things that

319.52 --> 323.84
I've been talking about like how tension

322.0 --> 326.08
is higher

323.84 --> 327.919
and everything you

326.08 --> 331.59999999999997
got is

327.919 --> 333.44
just more in tense and that can be both

331.6 --> 336.91900000000004
positive and negative but if you like

333.44 --> 340.319
get caught it's very easy to slip off

336.919 --> 340.31899999999996
your of your

341.52 --> 347.639
grounding and get caught up in things so

344.199 --> 350.199
if you get angry you it's suddenly war

347.639 --> 353.28000000000003
I've actually devised the phrase for it

350.199 --> 355.28000000000003
Christmas War it's the spirit of

353.28 --> 356.919
Christmas War it's that spirit that

355.28 --> 359.039
nobody wants to talk

356.919 --> 360.35999999999996
about right because you're supposed to

359.039 --> 363.52
be

360.36 --> 365.12
peace on Earth on Christmas day yeah but

363.52 --> 367.79999999999995
there's the spirit of Christmas War

365.12 --> 370.24
though and it does actually pop up but

367.8 --> 374.56
if you got if you just get angry at it

370.24 --> 377.319
or tell it to leave the room usually it

374.56 --> 379.68
it does just leave the room but yeah the

377.319 --> 383.56
the spirit of Christmas

379.68 --> 383.56
War does also

384.039 --> 387.68
exist and it does

388.4 --> 391.4
happen

394.479 --> 400.15999999999997
uh right but for her not so much just

398.639 --> 403.40000000000003
grief and

400.16 --> 406.12
like It's So Fresh So then when you

403.4 --> 407.84
dream it's like it gets really close to

406.12 --> 411.319
it I had the same thing when my mother

407.84 --> 411.31899999999996
died I had like for a

413.24 --> 419.199
year like up to two but especially that

416.44 --> 420.52
first year I would just have like dreams

419.199 --> 423.44
where I would

420.52 --> 426.68
like interact with my mother and it's

423.44 --> 431.039
like we were in a dream but we were

426.68 --> 433.919
conscious about it and then like

431.039 --> 436.919
consciously communicating like actually

433.919 --> 439.96
seeing her and seeing her move

436.919 --> 442.79999999999995
and and talk and everything and have

439.96 --> 446.039
Expressions on her face and then like

442.8 --> 448.319
realizing like but you're dead and that

446.039 --> 450.759
she's like

448.319 --> 454.24
yeah

450.759 --> 457.0
that's freaky man that kind of thing but

454.24 --> 459.8
I mean I guess that

457.0 --> 463.08
happens I've always wondered like is

459.8 --> 465.68
that like a special spiritual

463.08 --> 467.56
thing where I'm actually connecting or

465.68 --> 471.44
is that my

467.56 --> 474.36
desperation like making a vast

471.44 --> 476.44
simulation of my mother in order to

474.36 --> 478.599
figure it out and then it's really like

476.44 --> 483.159
yeah maybe the simulation is just as

478.599 --> 486.56
good maybe I did actually recreate the

483.159 --> 490.919
essentials of in my view what made her

486.56 --> 490.919
her to see how she would

492.199 --> 500.68
respond so it could be either that's

496.56 --> 503.68
this all the quantum dance you never

500.68 --> 506.52
know which one it is it could be both

503.68 --> 509.319
they can't well it could be either it

506.52 --> 512.4789999999999
can't be both but you're probably never

509.319 --> 514.719
going to find out which one it is this

512.479 --> 516.839
the quantum Dance I'm actually going to

514.719 --> 520.0390000000001
put that in the title I

516.839 --> 522.9190000000001
think because this seems to be a

520.039 --> 524.16
thing and it's turning out to be a thing

522.919 --> 527.279
with

524.16 --> 530.0799999999999
me with my fores

527.279 --> 532.68
sites a lot of the times it just turns

530.08 --> 534.399
into these branches and I'm like yeah

532.68 --> 537.0799999999999
I'm not going to

534.399 --> 539.36
choose I'm not just going to chop off

537.08 --> 542.0400000000001
one branch and just think claim the

539.36 --> 544.8000000000001
other one's the only

542.04 --> 547.079
thing so it's just like yeah they could

544.8 --> 549.8
be both and they're completely different

547.079 --> 554.4399999999999
but they could be both I mean I've been

549.8 --> 554.4399999999999
doing that with like my ideas

554.88 --> 559.68
of of what the Earth realm could be

560.16 --> 564.88
like way more than just two options so

563.16 --> 567.12
why can't I do

564.88 --> 571.4399999999999
it with

567.12 --> 575.64
all speculation and for

571.44 --> 575.6400000000001
side and so I'm naming

581.24 --> 585.6800000000001
it I'm naming it a Quantum

594.76 --> 601.12
dance and it's not a Quantum eraser

597.36 --> 601.12
dance don't worry about it

603.519 --> 611.16
right it's an idea it's it's naming a

607.399 --> 613.959
pattern a a repeating pattern that I'm

611.16 --> 615.959
spotting mostly myself like I'm noticing

613.959 --> 619.079
that I'm doing that and the funny thing

615.959 --> 623.1199999999999
was is in the past I would sort of

619.079 --> 627.079
intuitively attempt to do that too but

623.12 --> 628.04
then because I wasn't good at it I would

627.079 --> 629.5999999999999
lose

628.04 --> 633.16
track

629.6 --> 636.24
it would break off some of you people

633.16 --> 638.279
that have actually followed me for years

636.24 --> 640.6800000000001
and years and years since way in the

638.279 --> 643.04
beginning you might have memories of

640.68 --> 644.76
that of me like getting really into

643.04 --> 648.56
something and

644.76 --> 651.2
then oh and I like completely lose track

648.56 --> 652.88
and I can't pick it back up and I kind

651.2 --> 654.8000000000001
of like am embarrassed about it so I'm

652.88 --> 658.04
just like impromptu moving on to

654.8 --> 662.959
something new the embarrassment energy

658.04 --> 662.959
then fuels a restart of the

664.32 --> 670.12
subject so that it doesn't

666.88 --> 674.079
die right but

670.12 --> 676.639
now I don't lose track a lot of the

674.079 --> 678.4799999999999
times and I can just like keep on

676.639 --> 681.48
showing like both

678.48 --> 681.48
extremities

681.639 --> 688.16
parallel successfully I I I mean I hope

685.12 --> 689.5600000000001
that people can follow me when I do that

688.16 --> 691.88
but at least

689.56 --> 694.04
I can follow me when I do that and that

691.88 --> 696.4399999999999
seems kind of important that I follow

694.04 --> 696.4399999999999
what I'm

696.68 --> 703.04
doing for cohesion

700.04 --> 703.04
sake

703.12 --> 706.12
right

710.04 --> 718.0
anyhow Flat Earth de bait was

713.2 --> 720.24
intense but good a call was also very

718.0 --> 723.72
intense but like have I mean we were

720.24 --> 726.5600000000001
basically just two

723.72 --> 728.5600000000001
wizards just mind melding over the phone

726.56 --> 732.3199999999999
and I mean really this time I mean we

728.56 --> 734.56
tend to do that typically but now with

732.32 --> 736.9590000000001
like the ancestral winds going it is

734.56 --> 742.1199999999999
like there's just this magical energy

736.959 --> 742.1199999999999
going in this period the veil becomes

742.519 --> 750.88
thinner and so the energies become Rife

745.92 --> 750.88
and everything you do becomes more

751.8 --> 759.639
outspoken or more intense and magical

756.32 --> 763.9200000000001
things and subtle things like telepathy

759.639 --> 766.0790000000001
and empathy they also become more

763.92 --> 768.7199999999999
Amplified and if you're typically

766.079 --> 771.3599999999999
trained with them then they become like

768.72 --> 774.1600000000001
Powers more than

771.36 --> 776.76
normal while a person that's not trained

774.16 --> 780.12
with them will simply go ah what's going

776.76 --> 781.04
on why am I crazy now

780.12 --> 783.0
that's the

781.04 --> 787.279
difference all right anyway hello

783.0 --> 787.279
Richard G good to see you man how you

787.639 --> 793.44
doing can you believe I actually started

790.6 --> 796.24
the show completely on time for a

793.44 --> 799.8000000000001
change hello ter

796.24 --> 802.6
306 how does one determine a snake's

799.8 --> 804.7199999999999
gender

802.6 --> 807.76
uh

804.72 --> 810.0400000000001
I I don't know

807.76 --> 812.199
Tet

810.04 --> 815.04
I think they just stick a finger in it

812.199 --> 818.04
or something I I don't know what it

815.04 --> 818.04
don't quote me on

818.079 --> 822.5999999999999
that I I have a friend who knows that

821.16 --> 825.36
how to do

822.6 --> 828.32
that from my old Gaming group who has

825.36 --> 828.32
snakes

828.48 --> 835.1990000000001
but I don't remember I think it is like

833.279 --> 840.279
yeah basically if there's a hole that

835.199 --> 842.519
can fit your finger it's a female

840.279 --> 846.24
something like that it's something

842.519 --> 846.24
really basic like

849.639 --> 857.04
that I'm not entirely

853.36 --> 860.04
sure what type of snake was it

857.04 --> 860.04
the

860.88 --> 869.8389999999999
uh the well the thing is teret snakes

866.519 --> 874.24
can't actually talk

869.839 --> 877.44
so to assume that the Garden of Eden was

874.24 --> 882.24
like literally the scenario that we have

877.44 --> 885.36
here on Earth as we know it now is kind

882.24 --> 887.48
of yeah

885.36 --> 890.1990000000001
unrealistic so I don't think it was

887.48 --> 894.48
literally a snake as we know snakes like

890.199 --> 894.4799999999999
a big python or something

897.399 --> 904.16
no it might have been a

901.199 --> 906.639
dragon as

904.16 --> 909.92
in think

906.639 --> 914.32
of what do you call it a Komodo dragon

909.92 --> 917.639
type figure but different more yeah and

914.32 --> 922.24
much larger but I mean Adam was freaking

917.639 --> 926.5600000000001
huge as well right so who's to say that

922.24 --> 931.44
the snake wasn't actually very large as

926.56 --> 934.88
well maybe even Lar larger than Eve who

931.44 --> 939.6
was very much smaller than

934.88 --> 942.16
Adam in my opinion I mean whatever I'm

939.6 --> 945.0400000000001
going by that train of thinking by those

942.16 --> 947.319
presuppositions I think it was pretty

945.04 --> 950.319
pretty

947.319 --> 950.319
large

950.36 --> 955.279
right and who know

952.68 --> 958.3599999999999
maybe it's like a

955.279 --> 959.959
maybe the whole thing of Satan getting

958.36 --> 963.0790000000001
cast down to

959.959 --> 966.8389999999999
earth and like the idea of that this

963.079 --> 971.0
mountain Escape is actually like a a

966.839 --> 973.24
giant uh giant dragon that was cast down

971.0 --> 976.16
to her maybe all of that happened kind

973.24 --> 980.88
of sim simultaneously right maybe they

976.16 --> 986.24
all got thrown down to earth or

980.88 --> 986.24
materialized and they crashed down or

987.519 --> 996.8
Adam walked out with Eve and Satan was

992.88 --> 998.8389999999999
maybe s is this even like ever mentioned

996.8 --> 1002.519
in the Adam and Eve story like what the

998.839 --> 1007.759
[Â __Â ] happened to that damn snake I mean

1002.519 --> 1010.12
God Must Have Known like yo freaking

1007.759 --> 1012.519
lucif like

1010.12 --> 1014.04
Satan I knew you would do that and now

1012.519 --> 1016.92
I'm going to punish you something like

1014.04 --> 1019.519
that right and then he throws him out of

1016.92 --> 1023.759
the paradise

1019.519 --> 1023.759
after he banned Adam and

1024.36 --> 1031.8799999999999
Eve and I don't

1027.0 --> 1034.439
know I'm kind of like improvising

1031.88 --> 1037.679
thinking trying to fit puzzle pieces

1034.439 --> 1037.679
that might not really fit

1042.0 --> 1045.52
together secret

1046.0 --> 1050.4
to oh

1055.72 --> 1062.72
okay the one a Jungle Book python yeah

1059.88 --> 1062.72
that's just a

1062.84 --> 1068.48
python

1064.4 --> 1068.48
maybe but I mean I don't think

1077.4 --> 1080.4
so

1081.24 --> 1086.2
I think he look more like a like a

1083.679 --> 1088.5590000000002
Chinese dragon kind of thing right like

1086.2 --> 1093.96
a snake but actually a snake with

1088.559 --> 1097.2
completely flexible back but with

1093.96 --> 1097.2
legs and

1097.919 --> 1102.8400000000001
Claw there's even this crazy story by

1100.6 --> 1107.32
the way how I don't know where they came

1102.84 --> 1109.6789999999999
from some country Africa or Asia

1107.32 --> 1111.24
somewhere where like the snake

1109.679 --> 1113.039
originally had legs and then was

1111.24 --> 1117.64
punished by God or

1113.039 --> 1122.96
something took taken his legs away

1117.64 --> 1122.96
well you know something to think

1127.32 --> 1133.28
about maybe it was like

1130.679 --> 1136.2800000000002
no definitely

1133.28 --> 1136.28
not

1137.32 --> 1140.32
tooi

1163.72 --> 1169.28
right but anyway yeah whenever you think

1166.039 --> 1172.36
of the Adam and Eve story just with the

1169.28 --> 1175.32
paintings alone they typically use a

1172.36 --> 1178.4399999999998
python in the painting So if you're

1175.32 --> 1181.039
going to associate a python I don't

1178.44 --> 1184.48
blame you because that is the imagery

1181.039 --> 1187.799
that we have been reflected with

1184.48 --> 1192.24
upon thinking about it

1187.799 --> 1192.24
typically but my view is

1192.96 --> 1197.76
different CU I think that in a way

1195.32 --> 1199.9189999999999
that's programming too it's just

1197.76 --> 1204.28
programming from an old

1199.919 --> 1206.8400000000001
order right like in a way I really do

1204.28 --> 1209.36
see it like that it's like some of these

1206.84 --> 1212.84
stories from priests in the Catholic

1209.36 --> 1215.12
church I mean that's like CNN that's

1212.84 --> 1218.12
their CNN from

1215.12 --> 1220.76
then like everybody knew like this is

1218.12 --> 1222.9599999999998
freaking horeshit here's the real stuff

1220.76 --> 1226.12
yeah well we don't get to see the real

1222.96 --> 1227.919
stuff anymore we just get to see the CNN

1226.12 --> 1229.8799999999999
of that day just like in a few hundred

1227.919 --> 1232.6000000000001
years there's a good

1229.88 --> 1235.0390000000002
chance they will not know what the hell

1232.6 --> 1238.6789999999999
we have been talking about right maybe

1235.039 --> 1241.44
somebody dug up this secret forbidden

1238.679 --> 1244.2800000000002
Archive of like the Early Bird shows or

1241.44 --> 1247.0
something but I mean it's mostly going

1244.28 --> 1249.76
to be freaking retards talking like

1247.0 --> 1251.64
absolute imbeciles anyway useless

1249.76 --> 1254.08
information right but there might be

1251.64 --> 1257.1200000000001
some secret archives in the future they

1254.08 --> 1260.3999999999999
might find that are amazing but CNN is

1257.12 --> 1263.2399999999998
going to be very well documented right

1260.4 --> 1265.6000000000001
all their hor [Â __Â ] is going to be like

1263.24 --> 1268.0
yeah oh wow that's the news of the day

1265.6 --> 1271.559
well that's how we look back at their

1268.0 --> 1273.799
priest books yeah you got to realize

1271.559 --> 1278.0
that's

1273.799 --> 1281.039
CNN that's not that's the

1278.0 --> 1286.0
propaganda they wanted for the people to

1281.039 --> 1289.44
believe yeah not the actual total

1286.0 --> 1293.32
truth you got to realize

1289.44 --> 1296.2
that very important and now because when

1293.32 --> 1298.799
you're like shaping your in your search

1296.2 --> 1301.3600000000001
for God and with Christ and all you're

1298.799 --> 1303.6
just reflecting those things on yourself

1301.36 --> 1308.3999999999999
and just thinking it's holy no that's

1303.6 --> 1311.7199999999998
the CNN of that time yeah the truth and

1308.4 --> 1317.039
all that was there but these guys were

1311.72 --> 1319.1200000000001
more interested in trying to control

1317.039 --> 1322.1589999999999
people

1319.12 --> 1324.279
like how do we tell the story that'll

1322.159 --> 1328.919
make them do what we

1324.279 --> 1331.919
say you got to keep that in mind always

1328.919 --> 1337.8400000000001
otherwise you're going to fall for their

1331.919 --> 1337.8400000000001
CNN the CNN from 500 years

1342.799 --> 1349.96
ago did you have to mock what the hell

1346.0 --> 1349.96
are you talking about

1359.919 --> 1366.72
oh God I think it's the bot guy again

1362.64 --> 1366.72
with this crazy nonsensical

1367.49 --> 1370.559
[Music]

1372.559 --> 1378.8799999999999
sentences 10th 16th century don't know

1376.24 --> 1380.799
how well I don't know either tell oid

1378.88 --> 1384.44
but I do know that there's a good chance

1380.799 --> 1384.44
that a thousand years has

1384.52 --> 1390.8799999999999
been made

1386.84 --> 1390.8799999999999
up and put in

1392.039 --> 1396.72
between the timeline of our

1397.64 --> 1403.88
history right so

1401.84 --> 1405.799
Christ is

1403.88 --> 1409.88
likely much

1405.799 --> 1409.8799999999999
closer when that happened

1412.12 --> 1419.7199999999998
because yeah a thousand years have been

1417.0 --> 1422.279
just wow it's a thousand years there oh

1419.72 --> 1424.6000000000001
really where's the

1422.279 --> 1427.64
genealogies oh yeah it's all kind of

1424.6 --> 1429.6
messy oh things got lost oh so many wars

1427.64 --> 1431.64
it all got destroyed oh yeah really why

1429.6 --> 1434.1589999999999
did you then still have much more

1431.64 --> 1436.44
refined record from before that like

1434.159 --> 1439.64
nothing happened oh

1436.44 --> 1443.919
yeah yeah thousand years been

1439.64 --> 1446.0
invented yeah so in my view Christ was

1443.919 --> 1449.7990000000002
right before medieval

1446.0 --> 1453.2
times coming of Christ things

1449.799 --> 1454.8799999999999
changed yeah you got the great

1453.2 --> 1459.44
inspiration you got the

1454.88 --> 1459.44
Crusades pretty much right after all

1464.12 --> 1474.6789999999999
that and yeah it's all much closer

1469.52 --> 1476.52
like Christ is a thousand years

1474.679 --> 1481.3200000000002
ago

1476.52 --> 1484.76
like he still lived a thousand years

1481.32 --> 1487.4399999999998
ago literally a thousand years ago so

1484.76 --> 1490.96
it's not 2,000 years ago that's how I

1487.44 --> 1490.96
see it it's not that far

1496.76 --> 1499.76
away

1502.08 --> 1508.6399999999999
the basic idea was it's all sort of set

1504.279 --> 1512.24
in Spain southern France yeah that's

1508.64 --> 1512.24
right because it

1518.32 --> 1526.039
was I don't believe this story I'm sorry

1521.64 --> 1526.039
it's just like I think it's all made

1526.679 --> 1532.24
up

1529.279 --> 1535.559
like it's

1532.24 --> 1537.1200000000001
been relocated like the story's just

1535.559 --> 1540.9189999999999
been

1537.12 --> 1540.9189999999999
relocated that's how I see

1544.2 --> 1553.52
it right story based upon real events

1549.48 --> 1556.679
but the actual content has been altered

1553.52 --> 1560.32
dramatically as to not

1556.679 --> 1560.3200000000002
reveal what really

1560.88 --> 1567.3600000000001
happened right but the spirit of it and

1564.64 --> 1571.919
the words and the wisdom is all there

1567.36 --> 1571.9189999999999
it's just not literally

1572.44 --> 1579.159
there in those locations in the

1575.559 --> 1583.24
book I think that's all made

1579.159 --> 1587.1200000000001
up and it's like that was like

1583.24 --> 1590.08
a it's like tourism man like they just

1587.12 --> 1593.2399999999998
set it up like okay we're going to make

1590.08 --> 1596.1589999999999
these locations the holy locations it

1593.24 --> 1598.24
was just like a freaking Enterprise man

1596.159 --> 1603.7600000000002
I think they set it all up like a

1598.24 --> 1605.84
freaking Enterprise like a a Theocratic

1603.76 --> 1607.52
Corporation that's what I think the

1605.84 --> 1611.279
Bible actually

1607.52 --> 1614.679
is or what it what yeah that's what we

1611.279 --> 1620.88
were left with it was set up that way

1614.679 --> 1624.76
like to just make everybody want those

1620.88 --> 1627.5200000000002
locations I think that is what it

1624.76 --> 1630.279
is and in a way it's like fine I mean I

1627.52 --> 1635.1589999999999
don't need freaking Jerusalem or

1630.279 --> 1635.159
whatever to be in France so close to

1635.2 --> 1639.32
me right I don't need all that tourism

1637.799 --> 1643.399
[Â __Â ] and like

1639.32 --> 1643.399
religious competition and

1645.159 --> 1649.96
whatever hello Jason mccor see

1661.48 --> 1670.519
you snake was another

1665.519 --> 1670.519
snake Okay it's our time

1673.12 --> 1679.279
maybe but if it was a man then yeah how

1677.279 --> 1683.48
where did that man came from so there

1679.279 --> 1686.84
were three men God made three men did he

1683.48 --> 1689.84
and one was just a bad

1686.84 --> 1689.84
apple

1691.24 --> 1696.44
maybe it might be I mean I think that

1694.44 --> 1700.799
there is like this thing there's this

1696.44 --> 1703.559
thing within us within our design that

1700.799 --> 1705.76
like doesn't matter who you are where

1703.559 --> 1708.279
you come from you're going to have a lot

1705.76 --> 1710.12
of good people but there always going to

1708.279 --> 1711.48
be like these exceptions that are going

1710.12 --> 1714.32
to ruin

1711.48 --> 1717.3600000000001
it like they will always be born and

1714.32 --> 1720.36
every time and then you defeat them and

1717.36 --> 1723.32
then it's like oh finally it's over and

1720.36 --> 1725.6399999999999
then a new one like that is born and it

1723.32 --> 1727.6399999999999
just happens again and I think that that

1725.64 --> 1732.3990000000001
just happen keeps happening forever

1727.64 --> 1732.3990000000001
because it's like locked within our very

1736.399 --> 1740.5189999999998
design

1738.08 --> 1743.4399999999998
we're trapped with the snake the snake

1740.519 --> 1743.44
is trapped with

1747.36 --> 1753.9599999999998
us like during the incarnations at

1751.36 --> 1755.799
least like in our incarnations or

1753.96 --> 1758.2
physical incarnations we are trapped

1755.799 --> 1760.519
with the snake that also incarnates

1758.2 --> 1760.519
Among

1766.32 --> 1769.32
Us

1777.039 --> 1783.279
yes Tomo I think it's ridiculous Holy

1779.519 --> 1783.279
Land in the middle of the desert

1785.159 --> 1790.7990000000002
no I mean I'm not going to like contest

1788.0 --> 1794.12
with with Islam or whatever what they

1790.799 --> 1795.8799999999999
have with that region but it's because

1794.12 --> 1799.9599999999998
it's

1795.88 --> 1803.159
like not Universal and more personal

1799.96 --> 1807.039
it's more also about their tribe in in a

1803.159 --> 1810.159
way right and so then yeah I get it but

1807.039 --> 1813.48
to say oh the universal God of this

1810.159 --> 1815.8400000000001
world it's right there in Jerusalem like

1813.48 --> 1818.799
in the middle of that

1815.84 --> 1820.6789999999999
desert it's never really been all that

1818.799 --> 1822.559
great I mean there's probably been

1820.679 --> 1825.0
periods throughout history where it has

1822.559 --> 1827.6
been kind of nice but I mean that's

1825.0 --> 1831.44
everywhere but it's on average not

1827.6 --> 1831.4399999999998
particularly Splendid or

1836.799 --> 1841.84
anything right there's not something

1839.12 --> 1844.8799999999999
like magical about it that's just like

1841.84 --> 1846.24
wow this is the gate to heaven or no no

1844.88 --> 1850.2
it's a

1846.24 --> 1850.2
desert it's mostly just

1852.159 --> 1859.24
desert it couldn't be a tropical

1856.24 --> 1859.24
island

1859.399 --> 1862.8799999999999
I learned yeah I didn't even get to this

1861.84 --> 1866.84
but I

1862.88 --> 1870.3990000000001
mean Owen Benjamin yesterday man like as

1866.84 --> 1872.279
I said the whole day was so intense and

1870.399 --> 1875.12
inspiring

1872.279 --> 1878.039
first Flat Earth my own show was great

1875.12 --> 1879.639
Flat Earth debates was great had a call

1878.039 --> 1882.2
that was very intense and then Owen

1879.639 --> 1884.6789999999999
Benjamin had like a four hour show too

1882.2 --> 1888.48
it went way

1884.679 --> 1892.0
late but it was

1888.48 --> 1893.84
so esoteric and like Gardner was there

1892.0 --> 1897.48
with him and they like got into

1893.84 --> 1900.24
astrology and the man I felt like I was

1897.48 --> 1902.32
like in the Dark World with them

1900.24 --> 1905.08
eventually it got

1902.32 --> 1908.12
so spiritually intense and I could

1905.08 --> 1911.6
really follow them it was just wow

1908.12 --> 1915.84
amazing like intense gravy and it's

1911.6 --> 1915.84
still like going it's still in

1916.0 --> 1919.159
me h

1919.96 --> 1922.44
those

1922.919 --> 1929.6390000000001
great but he was talking about soil and

1927.12 --> 1932.84
how in the tropical regions they have

1929.639 --> 1935.4399999999998
soil issues because apparently

1932.84 --> 1937.12
soil

1935.44 --> 1940.6390000000001
needs

1937.12 --> 1945.4399999999998
season contrast season extremities did

1940.639 --> 1949.24
you know that like what he had a whole

1945.44 --> 1951.1200000000001
item about it on that show like

1949.24 --> 1954.799
explaining like yeah

1951.12 --> 1958.1999999999998
no like I make biochar in these giant

1954.799 --> 1960.44
Vats because you need to do that in the

1958.2 --> 1963.519
tropics otherwise your soul will just

1960.44 --> 1966.6000000000001
deplete you need to burn stuff and do

1963.519 --> 1969.6
something with it or whatever and then

1966.6 --> 1972.039
you can have very fertile

1969.6 --> 1974.799
land but in the

1972.039 --> 1977.639
north away from the equator you don't

1974.799 --> 1980.48
have those issues why

1977.639 --> 1982.9599999999998
because it

1980.48 --> 1985.76
freezes because of the different types

1982.96 --> 1988.679
of weathers and how goes back and forth

1985.76 --> 1990.36
much more than at the tropics but that

1988.679 --> 1994.919
apparently is

1990.36 --> 1997.08
critical for soil and that's

1994.919 --> 2000.2
like

1997.08 --> 2004.0
wow that's a

2000.2 --> 2006.32
thing amazing I'm learning a thing and

2004.0 --> 2008.24
I'm like really interested in soil I

2006.32 --> 2011.36
think that

2008.24 --> 2014.48
soil can like save the world knowing

2011.36 --> 2017.639
about it and so yeah Gardner is

2014.48 --> 2020.44
definitely contributing to that seems to

2017.639 --> 2020.4399999999998
be knowing what he's

2028.0 --> 2035.399
doing oh okay tomonoid 3 that's

2031.399 --> 2039.039
interesting right I'm G

2035.399 --> 2040.84
to damn it cools off I got an Illuminati

2039.039 --> 2042.48
C on here and I'm really hungry I was

2040.84 --> 2045.639
hungry even before the

2042.48 --> 2047.32
show but it's cool off again I'm going

2045.639 --> 2051.399
to put it in the oven back and I'm going

2047.32 --> 2053.399
to turn on the coffee is that sun are we

2051.399 --> 2056.399
getting actual

2053.399 --> 2056.399
sunlight

2056.639 --> 2064.76
wow right but I'm overflowing with gravy

2060.879 --> 2068.7999999999997
today from yesterday so I hope I can

2064.76 --> 2071.3590000000004
spill that forth on my show

2068.8 --> 2071.3590000000004
be right

2074.34 --> 2077.409
[Music]

2095.879 --> 2098.879
back

2125.8 --> 2128.8
for

2130.48 --> 2136.56
but I

2132.48 --> 2138.96
mean it's just so fascinating that

2136.56 --> 2141.68
apparently like the good Rich Earth

2138.96 --> 2145.44
that's like ideal for farming is

2141.68 --> 2148.96
typically made created and

2145.44 --> 2151.96
sustained in the

2148.96 --> 2151.96
moderate

2152.96 --> 2157.599
climates and so this also

2155.8 --> 2159.599
opposes

2157.599 --> 2162.1600000000003
view where you could say like yeah if

2159.599 --> 2166.119
there's going to be soil grown because

2162.16 --> 2168.56
you can do that you can grow and Export

2166.119 --> 2170.92
soil right you can also of course strip

2168.56 --> 2174.0789999999997
mine it or whatever that's that should

2170.92 --> 2175.839
never happen but you can literally

2174.079 --> 2180.88
actively grow

2175.839 --> 2182.52
it make the quantity more without losing

2180.88 --> 2185.28
the

2182.52 --> 2190.079
quality and I think that like there

2185.28 --> 2192.2400000000002
should be like science actual like real

2190.079 --> 2195.92
science behind

2192.24 --> 2199.4799999999996
that and like get make an industry like

2195.92 --> 2201.599
actually like yeah companies making soil

2199.48 --> 2203.2400000000002
and then selling soil you can have soil

2201.599 --> 2205.2000000000003
everywhere and it's like everywhere's

2203.24 --> 2208.9599999999996
rich soil like everywhere you go it's

2205.2 --> 2212.0789999999997
just freaking rich soil everywhere and

2208.96 --> 2214.599
now and now you

2212.079 --> 2217.0
got problems with weeds of course

2214.599 --> 2220.48
because weeds are going to like rich

2217.0 --> 2223.68
soil too so that's that's the

2220.48 --> 2226.0
downside but I mean it is it would make

2223.68 --> 2228.359
such a great future if like a lot of

2226.0 --> 2231.44
people just focused on like let's make

2228.359 --> 2234.88
the soil great again like we can

2231.44 --> 2238.8
actually do that it's not just

2234.88 --> 2241.52
a a bubble or a fake idea it's something

2238.8 --> 2241.52
we can really

2245.599 --> 2251.6400000000003
do I buy so for home Garden yeah sure

2249.52 --> 2256.48
you

2251.64 --> 2256.48
do so maybe it's already kind of

2256.72 --> 2266.04
happening just wondering

2259.4 --> 2266.04
like it's just more more you more of it

2271.839 --> 2278.52
better like just this crazy idea or

2275.68 --> 2281.3999999999996
something I don't know know like let's

2278.52 --> 2286.28
bury the world in fertile

2281.4 --> 2287.92
soil maybe I'm crazy I just like what if

2286.28 --> 2291.1600000000003
you just did

2287.92 --> 2294.44
that like if you just keep on having

2291.16 --> 2297.52
producing surplus of this stuff enough

2294.44 --> 2300.079
like from basically Barren materials

2297.52 --> 2302.319
into soil over

2300.079 --> 2304.6800000000003
time then you can

2302.319 --> 2309.8
literally attempt

2304.68 --> 2312.5989999999997
to fertilize just entire areas that were

2309.8 --> 2314.96
just kind of like Rocky desert or

2312.599 --> 2318.8
whatever before you like you could

2314.96 --> 2321.599
actually attempt to plan something like

2318.8 --> 2323.119
that where do you get the soil from you

2321.599 --> 2326.56
grow

2323.119 --> 2329.839
it you grow it that's the whole

2326.56 --> 2335.0
point you make

2329.839 --> 2335.0
more where before there was only dead

2335.52 --> 2338.52
dirt

2352.72 --> 2357.24
I don't know it's it's just an idea

2357.48 --> 2363.04
and and there must be a lot of mystery

2360.24 --> 2364.68
still about soil that aren't completely

2363.04 --> 2369.319
figured

2364.68 --> 2369.319
out I'm curious to run into

2381.88 --> 2387.359
them okay yeah Rock

2385.079 --> 2390.079
farming yeah Rock farming doesn't

2387.359 --> 2392.56
actually produce anything it just makes

2390.079 --> 2392.5600000000004
rocks

2395.4 --> 2400.96
bigger I wonder though if you could like

2398.119 --> 2403.2000000000003
use Rock farming to like make crystals

2400.96 --> 2403.2
or

2406.599 --> 2410.44
something nah probably

2413.96 --> 2419.0
not have programs where they will try to

2416.52 --> 2423.0
make large portions of land photo again

2419.0 --> 2425.4
yeah good good well they should I mean

2423.0 --> 2427.96
the world at this point would be crazy

2425.4 --> 2432.2400000000002
if they didn't do it like even the

2427.96 --> 2434.2
elites right like if not if like we

2432.24 --> 2436.839
don't want that for anyway if not for

2434.2 --> 2438.9199999999996
the world than for themselves like

2436.839 --> 2443.2799999999997
everybody out there should be doing that

2438.92 --> 2445.6800000000003
you'd be crazy not to with

2443.28 --> 2448.1600000000003
the with the

2445.68 --> 2450.2
developments and the technology that is

2448.16 --> 2451.0
here now and the understanding that has

2450.2 --> 2454.48
been

2451.0 --> 2457.839
attained it'd be crazy not to do that

2454.48 --> 2458.839
industrially even

2457.839 --> 2462.7599999999998
so

2458.839 --> 2466.56
good I'm glad they're doing it right I

2462.76 --> 2470.96
mean oh climate change loss of yeah make

2466.56 --> 2473.319
soil it's like screw all of that like oh

2470.96 --> 2476.52
no this happens that happens oh this

2473.319 --> 2476.52
that yeah make

2478.2 --> 2483.8799999999997
soil making

2480.64 --> 2488.359
soil in the bigger picture literally

2483.88 --> 2491.44
fixes everything and I mean

2488.359 --> 2493.0789999999997
everything every conceivable problem

2491.44 --> 2496.8
related to The

2493.079 --> 2496.8
Climate make

2497.48 --> 2506.16
soil think about it really think about

2500.599 --> 2506.1600000000003
it it fixes like every conceivable

2510.88 --> 2518.2400000000002
problem so much unused land yeah yeah

2515.24 --> 2518.24
right

2527.0 --> 2531.8
right but I mean Luke

2529.52 --> 2535.04
gramer you got to be careful though like

2531.8 --> 2537.319
who's going to use the land right

2535.04 --> 2539.44
because if you're going to be using

2537.319 --> 2543.8
pesticides and all that crap that

2539.44 --> 2545.16
actually depletes it very rapidly that's

2543.8 --> 2547.1600000000003
the whole point

2545.16 --> 2550.44
like

2547.16 --> 2553.72
soil not

2550.44 --> 2556.319
pesticide like pesticide destroys soil

2553.72 --> 2559.04
you need to grow soil not destroy it

2556.319 --> 2562.16
pesticide destroy soil right this whole

2559.04 --> 2564.119
issue with oh no all this farming over

2562.16 --> 2566.0789999999997
faring it's destroying that no [Â __Â ]

2564.119 --> 2569.359
pesticides

2566.079 --> 2572.76
is and not properly crop rotating and

2569.359 --> 2575.16
all that but really pesticides is doing

2572.76 --> 2577.6400000000003
the most damage

2575.16 --> 2579.7999999999997
worldwide that's is what that is what is

2577.64 --> 2582.0
doing it yeah now growing soil is

2579.8 --> 2584.92
exactly the

2582.0 --> 2587.88
opposite instead of destroying the

2584.92 --> 2591.28
ground making it worse for everything

2587.88 --> 2591.28
you make fertile

2593.44 --> 2599.2400000000002
ground much better right I'm going to

2596.52 --> 2602.44
get my coffee and

2599.24 --> 2602.4399999999996
my right

2605.079 --> 2608.079
back

2635.079 --> 2638.079
for

2665.0 --> 2668.0
for

2697.4 --> 2700.28
looking forward to

2704.35 --> 2712.179
[Applause]

2724.88 --> 2727.88
that

2735.22 --> 2738.31
[Applause]

2748.02 --> 2751.17
[Applause]

2754.88 --> 2757.88
no

2764.52 --> 2768.839
hey sorry I'm working on the

2770.44 --> 2776.04
title

2772.04 --> 2776.04
got more complete

2782.44 --> 2788.8
title yo where is everybody it's just

2785.48 --> 2791.8
Loop cramers not that of mine but where

2788.8 --> 2791.8
did everybody else

2799.16 --> 2805.5989999999997
go compost all your food yeah sure

2802.96 --> 2805.599
that's always

2814.8 --> 2818.76
good yeah and

2819.24 --> 2824.839
Ashes burn stuff throw ashes on

2825.72 --> 2829.8799999999997
there XG shells all of

2834.96 --> 2842.2
it scared everyone away I guess

2838.24 --> 2842.2
so I'm just going to eat my

2842.48 --> 2847.72
Illuminati a bit toasty anyway cheers

2848.8 --> 2854.4
and hey we still got

2851.04 --> 2857.4
a plenty of time to go for the rest of

2854.4 --> 2860.4
the show ah Rich

2857.4 --> 2860.4
G

2860.52 --> 2866.72
mushrooms mushrooms healthy soil yes

2863.28 --> 2871.559
indeed healthy soil requires fungus

2866.72 --> 2871.5589999999997
critical it's a critical

2874.72 --> 2877.72
component

2905.52 --> 2907.64
on

2914.03 --> 2917.159
[Music]

2924.17 --> 2927.2290000000003
[Music]

2927.4 --> 2931.4
ah I just feel great

2934.599 --> 2937.599
today

2941.72 --> 2947.7
ah you watch soil and

2943.599 --> 2949.96
green soil green is made out of

2947.7 --> 2953.48
[Music]

2949.96 --> 2955.839
people let ring they'll be breeding us

2953.48 --> 2955.839
like

2956.48 --> 2961.72
cattle yes I know good find epic

2964.52 --> 2967.52
classic

2983.48 --> 2989.04
it's scary because the movie like the

2986.96 --> 2992.079
way it's acted the way everybody's

2989.04 --> 2997.52
acting makes it so real like they're

2992.079 --> 2997.52
really role playing it like so real

2997.839 --> 3003.04
and despite it just being an old movie

3000.2 --> 3006.64
it just it really works you really feel

3003.04 --> 3006.64
like oh my God what is this

3009.64 --> 3014.0
future yeah fantastic old

3016.76 --> 3022.5200000000004
movie with still very relevant

3024.44 --> 3027.44
warnings

3028.24 --> 3034.9599999999996
I mean back then that was ridiculous

3032.119 --> 3037.6800000000003
right the whole death care thing now

3034.96 --> 3040.48
there is actual death care now that's

3037.68 --> 3041.799
that's even more crazy to think about

3040.48 --> 3045.4
that this

3041.799 --> 3047.599
movie like people would think that's

3045.4 --> 3051.88
outrageous at the time when this came

3047.599 --> 3055.2400000000002
out like that's ridiculous like H and

3051.88 --> 3057.44
now that actually exists to a degree

3055.24 --> 3057.4399999999996
what

3059.33 --> 3062.48
[Music]

3073.16 --> 3080.0
right I mean I think give CL Schwab and

3076.599 --> 3083.28
all that enough like just leave him as

3080.0 --> 3085.48
he is leave it all keep in going and it

3083.28 --> 3089.76
will turn into a soil and green univ

3085.48 --> 3089.76
first it will actually turn into

3093.64 --> 3102.7599999999998
that am I into video games at all uh

3100.44 --> 3105.4
uh a

3102.76 --> 3108.28
little yeah I used to be very game

3105.4 --> 3108.28
addicted when I was

3109.2 --> 3113.5989999999997
young yeah Luke is new here

3114.04 --> 3118.599
indeed hello Shing star water good to

3116.4 --> 3118.599
see

3123.64 --> 3129.44
you yeah I'm a little into video games I

3126.76 --> 3134.8390000000004
mean I only wanted to become a video

3129.44 --> 3134.839
game designer as a kid and as a

3136.88 --> 3139.88
teenager

3140.2 --> 3147.2799999999997
but yeah I'm not super into games

3143.68 --> 3147.2799999999997
anymore like that

3151.559 --> 3155.6800000000003
I kind of like got bored with the re

3153.799 --> 3158.0
with the video gaming and thought like

3155.68 --> 3161.04
yeah but figuring out people is actually

3158.0 --> 3163.4
a way more interesting type of video

3161.04 --> 3167.799
game and it's a video game that never

3163.4 --> 3167.799
shuts off you just have to do

3174.24 --> 3178.9199999999996
it right you can never win it there's

3176.599 --> 3178.92
always

3181.44 --> 3186.92
more figuring out people is like a

3184.24 --> 3188.8799999999997
self-designing game like the more you

3186.92 --> 3192.7200000000003
figure out the more complicated it

3188.88 --> 3192.7200000000003
becomes and

3195.64 --> 3199.1189999999997
yeah retro

3201.599 --> 3207.44
games

3204.0 --> 3208.76
right yeah got a couple of interesting

3207.44 --> 3211.68
retro

3208.76 --> 3216.28
games like I'm I got an emulator for

3211.68 --> 3218.72
like a arcade game that like made such a

3216.28 --> 3221.76
massive impact on me as a

3218.72 --> 3224.7599999999998
kid called hot Chase which is really

3221.76 --> 3227.28
like an arcade only

3224.76 --> 3231.4
game that I literally like played in

3227.28 --> 3234.48
Spain every time I got there epic epic

3231.4 --> 3235.6800000000003
game I mean it's like not even 3D or

3234.48 --> 3237.52
anything but

3235.68 --> 3241.52
I got that simulator and it's just like

3237.52 --> 3244.92
wow amazing that you can just do that

3241.52 --> 3246.44
now and I got like Super Nintendo

3244.92 --> 3248.28
simulator I used to have a Super

3246.44 --> 3251.599
Nintendo there's a couple of games there

3248.28 --> 3251.599
that are just

3257.96 --> 3263.319
great

3260.28 --> 3266.4
right the games now I'm just not even

3263.319 --> 3270.799
interested anymore I'm just

3266.4 --> 3273.1600000000003
it all it's all adapted to the the newer

3270.799 --> 3277.559
way which is all

3273.16 --> 3280.72
crap like no I don't want to be like

3277.559 --> 3284.8390000000004
that I don't want to be associated with

3280.72 --> 3289.48
that it's it's all less I don't want

3284.839 --> 3289.48
that newer games I'm mostly

3292.599 --> 3298.3590000000004
bored I'm bored of these figures that

3295.96 --> 3301.92
just want our attention all the all the

3298.359 --> 3305.4
time and don't actually have anything to

3301.92 --> 3309.28
give back for it sick of

3305.4 --> 3312.599
it sick of vapidness like oh this is the

3309.28 --> 3315.799
new form it doesn't have anything yay

3312.599 --> 3318.4
[Â __Â ] you I would just [Â __Â ] you I would

3315.799 --> 3321.079
just we keep doing what we do and you

3318.4 --> 3323.0
can keep your [Â __Â ] mental Revolution

3321.079 --> 3327.0
to yourself with your

3323.0 --> 3327.0
failed media product

3328.559 --> 3335.079
Double Dragon oh yeah man I played

3330.88 --> 3338.799
Double Dragon on the comer 64 though but

3335.079 --> 3343.48
God that was so kickass just with the

3338.799 --> 3347.48
friend you just so stupid game it's so

3343.48 --> 3351.64
awesome just beat the [Â __Â ] out of things

3347.48 --> 3351.64
rage win definitely likes Double

3354.0 --> 3357.0
Dragon

3363.799 --> 3368.24
64 emulator yeah I guess

3371.64 --> 3377.1189999999997
so football game from the 90s yeah now

3375.559 --> 3381.3590000000004
there's there were some really good

3377.119 --> 3386.92
working basic sports games in the

3381.359 --> 3386.92
90s right American nobody

3390.48 --> 3395.0
soccer football

3392.88 --> 3396.6400000000003
whatever there were those games and

3395.0 --> 3398.839
there were some of them that were just

3396.64 --> 3401.24
good and they just worked as a game it

3398.839 --> 3404.0389999999998
wasn't like oh it's super detailed oh

3401.24 --> 3406.7599999999998
the graphics no it it just worked it was

3404.039 --> 3408.92
just fun and those games

3406.76 --> 3411.5200000000004
succeeded I don't even know their names

3408.92 --> 3413.119
I just know they were there I knew a

3411.52 --> 3413.88
couple of people that were into that I

3413.119 --> 3416.88
was

3413.88 --> 3416.88
not

3416.96 --> 3421.319
right and the newer ones are just oh we

3418.68 --> 3425.319
want to make it look all super high Tey

3421.319 --> 3425.319
and then it still ends up

3432.28 --> 3438.48
sucking yeah not realistic like yeah

3434.839 --> 3440.2
[Â __Â ] realism it just has to work who

3438.48 --> 3444.16
gives us [Â __Â ] about

3440.2 --> 3448.52
realism like Graphics is just oh good

3444.16 --> 3450.5589999999997
graphics oh you mean electric suck yeah

3448.52 --> 3452.64
oh we have to have the high graph oh

3450.559 --> 3455.799
really because that cost like a 100

3452.64 --> 3457.68
times more energy than the stupid

3455.799 --> 3462.0389999999998
Graphics

3457.68 --> 3464.1189999999997
right how about climate change clim your

3462.039 --> 3466.6800000000003
your high-tech Graphics is really bad

3464.119 --> 3469.4
for climate change did you know that may

3466.68 --> 3471.48
maybe you should get a little bit more

3469.4 --> 3476.559
basic with the graphics because of

3471.48 --> 3478.079
climate change yeah uh uh

3476.559 --> 3481.2000000000003
ever thought of

3478.079 --> 3483.3590000000004
that oh no we have to high tech you but

3481.2 --> 3485.16
we have to have our simulated reality

3483.359 --> 3487.0789999999997
for a transhumanist project yeah your

3485.16 --> 3492.1189999999997
transhumanist project and your climate

3487.079 --> 3492.119
change project don't coincide you dumb

3492.94 --> 3496.01
[Music]

3500.68 --> 3505.64
[Â __Â ]

3502.839 --> 3508.4
yeah but they don't get it

3505.64 --> 3512.0
they don't get

3508.4 --> 3513.28
it they want to replace reality instead

3512.0 --> 3516.52
of giving

3513.28 --> 3518.76
us a little fun which is basically what

3516.52 --> 3521.079
computer games are always meant to be

3518.76 --> 3523.119
for a little fun it doesn't have to

3521.079 --> 3523.96
replace reality it just has to be a

3523.119 --> 3527.44
little

3523.96 --> 3529.359
fun yeah and when the graphics were a

3527.44 --> 3533.079
lot more

3529.359 --> 3535.5989999999997
simple you knew that the designers of

3533.079 --> 3537.079
them put a lot more effort PR into it

3535.599 --> 3538.2400000000002
they really thought like how is this

3537.079 --> 3542.44
going to look does this look good does

3538.24 --> 3545.4799999999996
this look they did so careful

3542.44 --> 3547.96
right now Graphics designers have just

3545.48 --> 3550.68
3D programs and it's just like however

3547.96 --> 3552.48
they want it they can get it but is that

3550.68 --> 3556.2799999999997
really

3552.48 --> 3557.76
good or is it just their style and

3556.28 --> 3560.92
nobody

3557.76 --> 3563.28
cares you

3560.92 --> 3565.28
know well with the old Graphics it's

3563.28 --> 3568.52
like no the one that made it like they

3565.28 --> 3571.6400000000003
really wanted it to be good for

3568.52 --> 3575.359
everybody like it had to be right with

3571.64 --> 3577.68
the Primitive available means and it was

3575.359 --> 3580.119
always better because then the graphics

3577.68 --> 3582.44
are just there to give you a little pull

3580.119 --> 3584.4
into the virtual what's supposed to be

3582.44 --> 3586.64
happening there what it

3584.4 --> 3588.96
represents and then you just get playing

3586.64 --> 3593.52
the game and the rest is in your head

3588.96 --> 3595.2400000000002
anyway right I mean I always have that

3593.52 --> 3597.96
especially with the older games like you

3595.24 --> 3599.64
play something you're like on a platform

3597.96 --> 3604.119
or something it's really boring and

3599.64 --> 3608.16
basic actually but then you just start

3604.119 --> 3611.48
to imagine but what is outside of this

3608.16 --> 3613.92
part that I can't go to what could have

3611.48 --> 3615.4
been there what's the rest of this world

3613.92 --> 3617.64
like even though it actually doesn't

3615.4 --> 3620.64
exist yeah because that's what the mind

3617.64 --> 3623.24
can do when you don't have to feel it

3620.64 --> 3625.5589999999997
all in do you have these imaginations

3623.24 --> 3629.0789999999997
when you have an over fill the world

3625.559 --> 3632.559
with 3D glory and now are you like oh

3629.079 --> 3635.319
man I really wonder what is out there no

3632.559 --> 3637.96
you're like I got enough already it's

3635.319 --> 3639.72
like yeah yeah everything just screams

3637.96 --> 3642.44
oh look at me look at me oh I'm so

3639.72 --> 3645.48
special I'm so

3642.44 --> 3647.68
beautiful like it's got to

3645.48 --> 3649.4
stop there's no more room for

3647.68 --> 3653.72
imagination when you

3649.4 --> 3655.2400000000002
just overfill everything with graphic

3653.72 --> 3658.2
[Â __Â ]

3655.24 --> 3661.1189999999997
yeah flashiness and Beauty it's too much

3658.2 --> 3664.5589999999997
you make too much you turn off people's

3661.119 --> 3666.039
imagination old games didn't do that

3664.559 --> 3668.88
they did the best they could with the

3666.039 --> 3672.079
means they had and then you would

3668.88 --> 3675.6400000000003
literally imagine the rest with it that

3672.079 --> 3678.7200000000003
was like part of the point it was even

3675.64 --> 3682.8799999999997
advertised like that it would stimulate

3678.72 --> 3685.16
your imagination with primitive visuals

3682.88 --> 3688.28
yeah remember

3685.16 --> 3691.48
before video games people would like

3688.28 --> 3693.6800000000003
play with stuff like Legos and it's like

3691.48 --> 3698.2400000000002
yeah a bunch of blocks oh it's supposed

3693.68 --> 3701.359
to represent this and in your mind it is

3698.24 --> 3703.5989999999997
that you visualize it in your mind to be

3701.359 --> 3706.2799999999997
that yeah it doesn't actually look like

3703.599 --> 3708.799
that but in your mind it's close

3706.28 --> 3711.119
enough and then you started to do that

3708.799 --> 3714.559
with video game where is that [Â __Â ] yeah

3711.119 --> 3717.079
it's all gone there's no more imagine

3714.559 --> 3720.2400000000002
just oh look at ours oh we're so special

3717.079 --> 3724.48
cookie cutter oh don't be offended oh

3720.24 --> 3727.1189999999997
like [Â __Â ] off man it's anti- stimulating

3724.48 --> 3727.96
everything you do is anti- stimulating

3727.119 --> 3731.279
out

3727.96 --> 3734.0
there stop

3731.279 --> 3736.68
oversaturating all the damn sensories

3734.0 --> 3739.24
all the damn

3736.68 --> 3741.96
time yeah Dungeons and Dragons is all

3739.24 --> 3743.7599999999998
imagination that's freaking right that's

3741.96 --> 3746.359
why I love it that's why I wrote a book

3743.76 --> 3746.3590000000004
about it

3759.43 --> 3762.489
[Music]

3762.839 --> 3769.88
a book yes a book a rule

3766.559 --> 3772.8390000000004
book I basically remade a version

3769.88 --> 3772.839
dungeon dragon

3773.079 --> 3779.279
3.87 or Square < TK

3776.4 --> 3782.52
15 also known as trolls and tyrants I'll

3779.279 --> 3784.96
give you the link most of it is still

3782.52 --> 3789.72
online it doesn't all work anymore

3784.96 --> 3793.0
unfortunately it's just a cheap ass free

3789.72 --> 3793.0
site where is

3795.68 --> 3798.96
it where is

3803.279 --> 3809.2
it man sometimes I just get lost in my

3806.559 --> 3812.1600000000003
own bookmarks I got so freaking I got

3809.2 --> 3815.5589999999997
bookmarks like 20 years worth

3812.16 --> 3815.5589999999997
of and it's

3815.96 --> 3821.119
organized

3817.839 --> 3821.119
anyway right

3833.279 --> 3838.279
here it's a bit

3835.359 --> 3840.48
old but this is what I had been doing

3838.279 --> 3843.88
like 10 years ago before Flat Earth

3840.48 --> 3843.88
actively I was making this

3844.079 --> 3850.2400000000002
book I got a printed version of it but

3846.76 --> 3851.88
it's outdated it just kept becoming

3850.24 --> 3854.319
outdated I just kept updating and

3851.88 --> 3856.119
updating and updating because it's a

3854.319 --> 3858.839
rule book and you need to update it to

3856.119 --> 3860.599
get it right it just you keep doing it

3858.839 --> 3863.279
but I'm kind of done I could technically

3860.599 --> 3865.48
say like okay I'm done I just know from

3863.279 --> 3867.64
myself that if I do that it's like okay

3865.48 --> 3869.839
now I'm going to print it is immediately

3867.64 --> 3871.7599999999998
the moment all brilliant new kind of

3869.839 --> 3873.4
ideas comes forth and then they're like

3871.76 --> 3875.039
yeah now you're getting the idea because

3873.4 --> 3878.599
you just got it

3875.039 --> 3882.96
printed it's like that's how it

3878.599 --> 3885.319
works my ideas can be kind of like a

3882.96 --> 3888.559
bastard because they always tend to fall

3885.319 --> 3888.5589999999997
in my lap when it's most

3889.68 --> 3894.68
inconvenient it's like I get inspiration

3891.96 --> 3896.88
to distract myself

3894.68 --> 3899.1189999999997
from things that are unpleasant or even

3896.88 --> 3901.2400000000002
to escape responsibility and that's like

3899.119 --> 3903.799
a thing that I've had in the past it's

3901.24 --> 3906.5589999999997
really annoying it's like I'm not going

3903.799 --> 3909.16
to do my homework because I have super

3906.559 --> 3911.1600000000003
heavy inspiration about something else

3909.16 --> 3913.24
that is still very valuable like

3911.16 --> 3916.64
esoteric understanding and then like

3913.24 --> 3918.7599999999998
make entire chart be yeah because I

3916.64 --> 3920.0389999999998
actually had to do something else but I

3918.76 --> 3923.2000000000003
didn't want

3920.039 --> 3925.0
to and then I don't just look I'm not

3923.2 --> 3928.4399999999996
going to do it and then knew nothing no

3925.0 --> 3930.72
I get distracted by heavy inspiration

3928.44 --> 3933.599
that suddenly arrives because I actually

3930.72 --> 3936.5989999999997
had to do something else and that's a

3933.599 --> 3939.2400000000002
system that I was like plagued with when

3936.599 --> 3942.119
I was a team like that continually

3939.24 --> 3944.0389999999998
happened which was amazing but also

3942.119 --> 3946.839
extremely

3944.039 --> 3949.8390000000004
disruptive cuz I did get just amazing

3946.839 --> 3949.839
inspiration from that

3953.079 --> 3956.079
anyway

3961.599 --> 3968.44
massive all right so there you

3965.2 --> 3973.72
go for the camera this is basically the

3968.44 --> 3973.7200000000003
DND D book I think I got it this is just

3977.24 --> 3983.0
one3 no this is

3980.19 --> 3986.0
[Music]

3983.0 --> 3986.0
MX

3992.52 --> 3998.88
yeah it's just these two I mean this is

3995.319 --> 4001.92
all this is all I made it's only like a

3998.88 --> 4004.92
th000 pages of s hyper

4001.92 --> 4004.92
technical

4005.079 --> 4012.48
text that I've worked like

4008.96 --> 4015.0
over it's probably like 10,000 hours I

4012.48 --> 4017.2400000000002
worked on this

4015.0 --> 4020.319
like in retrospect it's really crazy

4017.24 --> 4023.1189999999997
that I did this so much time that I put

4020.319 --> 4026.359
into this it's really literally crazy

4023.119 --> 4028.76
but I mean it is perfect it's just that

4026.359 --> 4030.52
it's free everybody can literally

4028.76 --> 4033.559
download this and use

4030.52 --> 4037.559
this it's open license I specifically

4033.559 --> 4040.88
made it free it's like Hi here's 10,000

4037.559 --> 4043.6400000000003
hours of me figuring out like a like a

4040.88 --> 4044.48
lawyer or something I I wrote this book

4043.64 --> 4048.1189999999997
like a

4044.48 --> 4048.119
lawyer I really

4048.359 --> 4055.119
did

4050.64 --> 4058.839
right here just rule changes like

4055.119 --> 4062.4
changing the rules of detail

4058.839 --> 4064.839
rules like that alone is pretty massive

4062.4 --> 4067.96
but I mean did this is my

4064.839 --> 4072.44
masterpiece the skill descriptions holy

4067.96 --> 4075.52
[Â __Â ] this used to be like three or four

4072.44 --> 4078.68
pages now

4075.52 --> 4082.92
it's 58

4078.68 --> 4086.279
pages and it's all worth it all of it is

4082.92 --> 4088.6800000000003
exactly what you can do with skills and

4086.279 --> 4091.799
how and how that

4088.68 --> 4094.7599999999998
balances right because the original D

4091.799 --> 4097.199
andd just didn't understand or do

4094.76 --> 4102.12
anything with skills it was like a side

4097.199 --> 4105.839
effect that's a lot of no [Â __Â ] Tommy no

4102.12 --> 4105.839
[Â __Â ] I know it's a lot

4109.6 --> 4116.04
work I and I can prove it God damn it is

4113.799 --> 4119.44
this freaking insane

4116.04 --> 4119.44
big holy

4121.52 --> 4128.679
[Â __Â ] and it's like tables tables tables

4125.839 --> 4132.44
like it's not just a bunch of text it's

4128.679 --> 4135.6
the tables all the tables D and D style

4132.44 --> 4137.599999999999
I I made this book exactly like it is an

4135.6 --> 4140.52
original D and D book The only thing

4137.6 --> 4143.319
that's missing is like decorative

4140.52 --> 4147.120000000001
Graphics all than that it just is a

4143.319 --> 4147.120000000001
Dungeons and dragon it really

4149.48 --> 4156.5599999999995
is

4152.0 --> 4156.56
Right tables styles are the

4157.159 --> 4163.159
same yeah let me show you like this here

4160.159 --> 4164.719
here I open it on the skill descriptions

4163.159 --> 4168.12
in one

4164.719 --> 4171.44
go so this is how the skill descriptions

4168.12 --> 4175.96
look in the original dungeon dragons

4171.44 --> 4178.678999999999
book right let's see starting there

4175.96 --> 4182.52
bottom down and then over here little

4178.679 --> 4185.799
tables I mean this is nothing

4182.52 --> 4188.6
man let's see how many pages this

4185.799 --> 4191.0
is one thing that really makes it nice

4188.6 --> 4195.719
that's there's a couple of drawings in

4191.0 --> 4195.719
there that's kind of cute

4197.0 --> 4205.92
box use magic item the most neglected

4201.32 --> 4205.92
skill ever right this

4207.52 --> 4215.64
is oh 13 pages in

4212.48 --> 4218.639999999999
total 13

4215.64 --> 4218.64
Pages

4219.92 --> 4224.8
mine

4221.64 --> 4227.1990000000005
58 h

4224.8 --> 4232.04
I think I I put a little bit more work

4227.199 --> 4236.5599999999995
into it but holy [Â __Â ] just the HED rope

4232.04 --> 4238.4
skill alone is like yeah oh use rope one

4236.56 --> 4240.320000000001
thing you could describe to do with it

4238.4 --> 4242.759999999999
oh that's kind of lame yeah now there's

4240.32 --> 4245.159
like actually like really complicated

4242.76 --> 4247.4800000000005
things you can do with ropes like you

4245.159 --> 4251.32
can actually do in

4247.48 --> 4255.12
reality that's like how the old ships

4251.32 --> 4257.5599999999995
were held together with freaking n

4255.12 --> 4259.32
you have to know how that actually

4257.56 --> 4263.4400000000005
works

4259.32 --> 4268.08
uh and then the survival skill which

4263.44 --> 4271.5599999999995
is the survival skill is like four

4268.08 --> 4273.88
pages because there's so many things you

4271.56 --> 4276.52
do with survival skill in dungeon

4273.88 --> 4279.32
dragons it's unbelievable not just

4276.52 --> 4281.52
everything that you do with tracking

4279.32 --> 4284.799999999999
with the tracking

4281.52 --> 4287.84
feet but like Tran get through an area

4284.8 --> 4290.719
traveling through hazardous Natural Area

4287.84 --> 4293.52
and then knowing how to avoid pitfalls

4290.719 --> 4295.88
that might happen right or knowing when

4293.52 --> 4297.320000000001
a storm might be coming and then taking

4295.88 --> 4301.400000000001
that into

4297.32 --> 4301.4
account finding food of

4303.0 --> 4310.36
course like how do you resist extreme

4306.44 --> 4313.879999999999
weather help yourself with that but also

4310.36 --> 4316.199
like uh what is it extract monster

4313.88 --> 4320.719
resource yeah well there's entire video

4316.199 --> 4324.638999999999
games about that now but it's like yeah

4320.719 --> 4328.2390000000005
uh body parts of creatures what can you

4324.639 --> 4329.84
do with that i' made an entire material

4328.239 --> 4333.599999999999
system for

4329.84 --> 4337.159000000001
this like exactly how to make materials

4333.6 --> 4338.8
from what so you know how much of it and

4337.159 --> 4340.759999999999
that you can literally in the dunge and

4338.8 --> 4342.28
Dragons game like oh a creature and I'm

4340.76 --> 4344.1990000000005
like oh I'm really impressed by this

4342.28 --> 4347.199
creature it was such an Adventure that

4344.199 --> 4349.719
way that happen I'm going to make an

4347.199 --> 4353.678999999999
armor out of him or I'm going to

4349.719 --> 4356.159
make like an alar with his bones or

4353.679 --> 4358.88
something right think about it you can

4356.159 --> 4363.44
technically do it you can

4358.88 --> 4366.84
make like you can take like a turtle

4363.44 --> 4370.04
scale and make an armor out of it a

4366.84 --> 4372.32
carass there's so many things you can do

4370.04 --> 4376.0
in this

4372.32 --> 4378.5599999999995
game and and like now it's actually

4376.0 --> 4378.56
actually

4380.0 --> 4385.88
defined like this can be turned into a

4383.719 --> 4388.56
video game

4385.88 --> 4390.36
system it it was kind of meant to do

4388.56 --> 4395.320000000001
that for

4390.36 --> 4398.639
me it's just a lot God is it a

4395.32 --> 4400.679
lot right so that's just the skills

4398.639 --> 4401.6
sorry I'm going in DND D now I'm really

4400.679 --> 4405.159
into

4401.6 --> 4408.0
this then I rewrote the original base

4405.159 --> 4410.12
classes and added a few to the base

4408.0 --> 4412.36
classes

4410.12 --> 4415.4
right this is probably the most

4412.36 --> 4418.32
impressive work I did because these

4415.4 --> 4422.12
classes are like super

4418.32 --> 4425.159
balanced and there's a lot more minor

4422.12 --> 4428.36
spellcasting going on there's like more

4425.159 --> 4431.159
options more Dynamics going on Magic is

4428.36 --> 4433.88
really prominent in DND and now it's

4431.159 --> 4435.5599999999995
actually been given that rightful place

4433.88 --> 4437.4800000000005
instead of just like oh there's just a

4435.56 --> 4440.2390000000005
couple of people that have all the magic

4437.48 --> 4443.36
power and then there's the rest and like

4440.239 --> 4445.599999999999
yeah you do stuff and nobody cares

4443.36 --> 4449.08
because that's kind of like what used to

4445.6 --> 4450.88
be happening with d and d is that it's

4449.08 --> 4452.5199999999995
like oh yeah you have the the the really

4450.88 --> 4456.8
powerful characters and then you have

4452.52 --> 4461.0
the rest now here every class you can be

4456.8 --> 4461.0
has like its own ultimate

4462.0 --> 4467.36
power that you can develop with it own

4468.159 --> 4472.92
style wow and that's just the base

4470.88 --> 4474.719
glasses man The Prestige glasses are out

4472.92 --> 4481.4
of this world

4474.719 --> 4486.56
literally ah feets [Â __Â ] oh my God new

4481.4 --> 4486.5599999999995
spells h Arwin of course Arwin had

4486.719 --> 4495.28
to have an entire new spells

4491.52 --> 4495.280000000001
book how many page

4495.92 --> 4502.52
this oh it's not numbered I didn't even

4499.0 --> 4502.52
number it because it's too

4503.239 --> 4506.879999999999
many oh my

4509.96 --> 4516.679
God AI yeah I don't use AI I just don't

4514.36 --> 4516.679
[Â __Â ]

4521.679 --> 4528.84
that I got PE PDFs with this stuff so

4525.76 --> 4532.08
that's that's just the paper

4528.84 --> 4535.32
version I got all the real The Originals

4532.08 --> 4539.36
the most updated versions all here on my

4535.32 --> 4543.32
computer let's see how many pages is

4539.36 --> 4549.199
spells I got just page numbers on it oh

4543.32 --> 4552.96
what it's only 71 Pages wait no 70 rest

4549.199 --> 4555.678999999999
is the open license text what I only

4552.96 --> 4560.0
have have 70 pages of

4555.679 --> 4560.0
spells I'm kind of disappointed in

4572.159 --> 4577.239
myself right but at least it's over 60

4577.88 --> 4581.52
anyway let me show

4582.12 --> 4585.12
you

4586.0 --> 4590.4
great yeah no not that big

4593.679 --> 4601.4800000000005
thanks okay not that small either

4598.48 --> 4601.48
sheesh

4602.0 --> 4605.25
whatever all right so there you go it's

4604.719 --> 4606.56
a bit

4605.25 --> 4610.4
[Music]

4606.56 --> 4612.080000000001
small maybe I could margin it up a

4610.4 --> 4615.08
bit

4612.08 --> 4615.08
no

4619.04 --> 4623.84
all right that'll help so that's a

4633.48 --> 4639.678999999999
summary yeah the summary and the thing

4637.04 --> 4641.32
is like there's a lot of like completely

4639.679 --> 4643.76
new spells in

4641.32 --> 4645.92
here that I made up

4643.76 --> 4650.400000000001
I thought like yeah I mean I know

4645.92 --> 4652.36
there's like 50,000 different DND spells

4650.4 --> 4656.48
but I thought like yeah this one needs

4652.36 --> 4658.04
to be made this one needs to be in there

4656.48 --> 4660.678999999999
and so I made a whole bunch of new ones

4658.04 --> 4664.36
but I especially

4660.679 --> 4667.04
revisiting old spells that were already

4664.36 --> 4670.199
there they very prominent they had to

4667.04 --> 4675.0
had to revisit them why because I've

4670.199 --> 4675.0
like created a universal

4675.32 --> 4681.159
system for like all spells like how they

4678.679 --> 4683.76
should be working the proper B it

4681.159 --> 4686.96
already had certain types of balanced

4683.76 --> 4690.320000000001
ideas about how to balance it how to

4686.96 --> 4692.04
regard it I improved upon that and so

4690.32 --> 4693.239
there's a lot of spells that basically

4692.04 --> 4696.0
altered

4693.239 --> 4698.48
slightly so they become more balanced

4696.0 --> 4700.719
and yeah that's why there are 70 pages

4698.48 --> 4700.718999999999
of

4701.4 --> 4704.92
spells it's like

4705.159 --> 4710.0
what is it a third to half are

4710.76 --> 4715.719
Revisited but there's plenty of ones

4712.84 --> 4719.4800000000005
that are just completely

4715.719 --> 4723.96
new right so here you go this like one

4719.48 --> 4728.599999999999
spell animate objects it's all this all

4723.96 --> 4728.6
this like a page of text just one

4730.8 --> 4736.8
spell anti-magic field

4733.52 --> 4741.280000000001
very prominent spell very important in

4736.8 --> 4741.28
DD I Revisited it to

4741.639 --> 4746.639
completely define it redefine it in

4744.28 --> 4750.04
detail because it needs to

4746.639 --> 4752.32
be because there were open ends in the

4750.04 --> 4754.36
original descriptions of these spells

4752.32 --> 4755.159
like open ends that are fatal it's like

4754.36 --> 4758.04
a

4755.159 --> 4761.08
loophole if somebody chooses to exploit

4758.04 --> 4765.96
it then the entire game is

4761.08 --> 4768.5199999999995
[Â __Â ] right I wrote all the Spells and

4765.96 --> 4773.0
rewrote all the Spells specifically to

4768.52 --> 4777.56
close all the legal loopholes of the

4773.0 --> 4779.56
game mechanics all of it to make it

4777.56 --> 4781.52
really

4779.56 --> 4784.320000000001
reliable and

4781.52 --> 4788.320000000001
predictable so that you know exactly

4784.32 --> 4791.4
what you should expect of magic and what

4788.32 --> 4794.5599999999995
it can do that you know what it can do

4791.4 --> 4797.92
specifically and what it can't do

4794.56 --> 4797.92
do right

4800.679 --> 4807.08
anyhow uh no luk cramers I no I'm not

4804.56 --> 4807.080000000001
going to do

4807.44 --> 4812.4
anything don't get me involved with the

4810.48 --> 4816.0
AI generated

4812.4 --> 4816.0
crap I'm not doing

4821.76 --> 4824.76
it

4841.719 --> 4848.28
I don't like the stuff yeah that's

4844.639 --> 4848.28
right I think it's

4851.719 --> 4854.719
useless

4855.08 --> 4858.8
I think it's

4856.32 --> 4862.32
cheap it's

4858.8 --> 4865.2390000000005
Kit it'll get boring really

4862.32 --> 4867.679
quickly and before you know it people

4865.239 --> 4870.12
will literally like completely abandon

4867.679 --> 4870.12
it

4870.6 --> 4876.84
entirely and just find anything that was

4874.36 --> 4876.839999999999
actually

4877.04 --> 4884.639
man-made and not by some stupid

4881.639 --> 4884.639
algorithm

4888.199 --> 4894.5199999999995
like for example the things that fiber

4890.159 --> 4898.239
oats makes like fiber outs makes real

4894.52 --> 4900.040000000001
paintings by hand and he shows them like

4898.239 --> 4905.04
the updates and everything that's

4900.04 --> 4905.04
fascinating art not AI

4909.6 --> 4917.2390000000005
crap AI is a whole no AI of course not

4912.96 --> 4917.2390000000005
AI as a whole no AI

4917.96 --> 4925.32
is it's just another layer of interc

4921.84 --> 4925.32
computer communication with

4926.08 --> 4930.679
people right what started out with

4929.44 --> 4934.04
typing on a

4930.679 --> 4938.0
keyboard then turn into a mouse

4934.04 --> 4941.56
then voice interface and now we have

4938.0 --> 4944.56
artificial human

4941.56 --> 4944.56
procedures

4954.04 --> 4959.4
just G what is this are you serious

4962.32 --> 4967.159
teret you don't know what dungeon dragon

4964.76 --> 4967.159000000001
is come

4971.56 --> 4974.56
on

4979.719 --> 4986.2390000000005
maybe AI generated artst

4982.56 --> 4986.2390000000005
helpful it's really

4987.6 --> 4991.679
cheap and maybe I don't want

4997.6 --> 5003.76
it like what's the point

5001.48 --> 5006.5599999999995
anyway

5003.76 --> 5009.96
seriously what is the point like this

5006.56 --> 5012.2390000000005
book is online for free you could just

5009.96 --> 5015.44
have it what's the point of me like oh

5012.239 --> 5015.44
putting a bunch of Art in

5019.56 --> 5025.84
there right and if an illustrator uses a

5023.159 --> 5027.96
bit of AI generated stuff to like assist

5025.84 --> 5030.6
him or like give him a framework or

5027.96 --> 5033.159
whatever and he does the rest

5030.6 --> 5036.52
manually I have nothing against against

5033.159 --> 5040.48
that I just don't want to replace actual

5036.52 --> 5040.4800000000005
artistic skill with an AI

5046.04 --> 5053.199
generator is that a new large size glass

5048.679 --> 5053.1990000000005
no it's an old large siiz glass D

5053.6 --> 5058.159000000001
it because my mug is kind of broken

5056.12 --> 5060.48
right now I need to fix it with some

5058.159 --> 5063.199
glue but I don't have that glue right

5060.48 --> 5066.08
now and this keeps the coffee warmer

5063.199 --> 5068.678999999999
longer anyway so I'm kind of liking

5066.08 --> 5068.679
using this

5086.4 --> 5093.159
thing people that are scared by all text

5090.119 --> 5097.48
material why L cramers why

5093.159 --> 5100.08
hi um this is Dungeons and Dragons rule

5097.48 --> 5103.5599999999995
book you do realize

5100.08 --> 5106.04
that if you're scared of

5103.56 --> 5109.679
text why the hell are you holding a

5106.04 --> 5109.679
Dungeons and Dragons book

5117.159 --> 5123.799999999999
seriously yes I know teret I still have

5120.08 --> 5128.0
it it's right here

5123.8 --> 5131.119000000001
it's just that this thing chipped out I

5128.0 --> 5131.119
have to glue it back

5150.679 --> 5157.96
in right besides my book isn't just not

5154.44 --> 5159.879999999999
just nonstop text text text there's

5157.96 --> 5162.52
there's little tables in

5159.88 --> 5165.84
there

5162.52 --> 5169.4400000000005
right I mean I did actually manage to

5165.84 --> 5171.76
like space out my book in a way that you

5169.44 --> 5175.08
don't just get lost or get a giant

5171.76 --> 5178.1990000000005
headache from it like I like reading my

5175.08 --> 5181.84
D DND D book I I read it every now and

5178.199 --> 5184.0
I'm like o i oh how did I do that it's

5181.84 --> 5187.639
like oh I need to look into the teleport

5184.0 --> 5191.96
spell for a bit because I rewrote the

5187.639 --> 5194.96
teleport spell and I'm like super super

5191.96 --> 5197.2390000000005
proud of it how I did it because like I

5194.96 --> 5199.88
literally created a new standard where

5197.239 --> 5201.718999999999
there was none before where it was just

5199.88 --> 5206.0
dumb

5201.719 --> 5209.719
chaos and now it's a perfect ruled

5206.0 --> 5212.84
system that really works that like Works

5209.719 --> 5216.28
in a in a complex game mechanism

5212.84 --> 5219.08
like it's like this idea oh once you

5216.28 --> 5221.8
introduce teleport into the game it like

5219.08 --> 5225.0
breaks everything yeah why because the

5221.8 --> 5227.4800000000005
way teleport worked was broken it was

5225.0 --> 5229.96
like unrestricted it was crazy it's like

5227.48 --> 5231.799999999999
oh you can just go anywhere yeah now it

5229.96 --> 5233.679
doesn't work like that anymore now it's

5231.8 --> 5237.360000000001
very

5233.679 --> 5237.36
specific very

5237.719 --> 5245.08
specific right so let me just bore you

5240.8 --> 5246.8
all to death by reading out the text

5245.08 --> 5249.119
from

5246.8 --> 5250.6
teleport it's like only half a page

5249.119 --> 5253.159
don't

5250.6 --> 5256.4800000000005
worry right so this is going to sound

5253.159 --> 5258.679
really dry this is not literature this

5256.48 --> 5261.159
is technical rule text so it's going to

5258.679 --> 5264.719
sound really

5261.159 --> 5267.719
dry all right so teleport a Conjuration

5264.719 --> 5269.719
Spell only need a vocal component it's

5267.719 --> 5274.56
instantaneous there's

5269.719 --> 5277.8
no doesn't take a while to cast range is

5274.56 --> 5279.96
almost unlimited it's very far 100 mes

5277.8 --> 5283.679
per level yeah it's extremely far and

5279.96 --> 5286.84
yeah there's way more than 100

5283.679 --> 5290.04
miles like there can but there's greater

5286.84 --> 5292.52
teleport has no limit distance anyway

5290.04 --> 5294.36
it's still not extra dimensional right

5292.52 --> 5296.4800000000005
there's still the other planes teleport

5294.36 --> 5298.719
can't maneuver you to other planes it

5296.48 --> 5301.32
can just maneuver you within the plane

5298.719 --> 5304.04
that you are at the material plane that

5301.32 --> 5307.08
you're at because there's multiple that

5304.04 --> 5309.88
are parallel anyway so you can

5307.08 --> 5312.639
instantaneously move yourself and up or

5309.88 --> 5317.719
to one touched creature for three Caster

5312.639 --> 5321.08
levels to any location you know of wait

5317.719 --> 5324.8
no W on the plane you currently reside

5321.08 --> 5328.32
on not further away than 100 mile per

5324.8 --> 5331.04
Caster level have to know the location

5328.32 --> 5333.5599999999995
by having seen it or experiencing it in

5331.04 --> 5336.88
another way by for example

5333.56 --> 5339.84
Vision or by a crying spell or seeing an

5336.88 --> 5343.28
image in another's Mind through

5339.84 --> 5345.92
telepathy who has been in the location

5343.28 --> 5348.639
you also have to know of its position

5345.92 --> 5351.4800000000005
relative to other locations that are

5348.639 --> 5354.4800000000005
familiar to you on the same plane to be

5351.48 --> 5358.599999999999
able to go there with teleport

5354.48 --> 5358.599999999999
yeah that's

5358.96 --> 5363.28
specific you can't go anywhere unless

5361.96 --> 5366.84
unless it is

5363.28 --> 5368.599999999999
known by someone or something the

5366.84 --> 5371.04
knowledge has to be attained so

5368.6 --> 5373.92
technically you could have like a a

5371.04 --> 5376.44
ghost in a in a glass or

5373.92 --> 5379.4
whatever that has the knowledge of a

5376.44 --> 5381.638999999999
location nobody else that's alive knows

5379.4 --> 5385.32
of the location it's completely lost but

5381.639 --> 5388.56
that ghost knows it right now you made a

5385.32 --> 5390.799999999999
plot point for the game how do you get

5388.56 --> 5392.639
the ghost to give you that location

5390.8 --> 5394.719
information or how do you

5392.639 --> 5396.159000000001
because you need it to get on with the

5394.719 --> 5400.4800000000005
quest

5396.159 --> 5403.759999999999
right here you go teleport very specific

5400.48 --> 5408.599999999999
very outlined very ruled and now you can

5403.76 --> 5408.6
use those rules to make a

5408.719 --> 5414.119
plot that's our win for you that's what

5412.08 --> 5418.4
I do right

5414.119 --> 5420.679
anyway if you teleport another willing

5418.4 --> 5423.04
creature or together with another

5420.679 --> 5424.76
willing creature you can use the

5423.04 --> 5426.8
creature's knowledge to determine the

5424.76 --> 5428.639
destination of the teleport you can

5426.8 --> 5431.119000000001
trick a creature into revealing the

5428.639 --> 5433.04
knowledge or read their mind magically

5431.119 --> 5435.5599999999995
you cannot use another's knowledge this

5433.04 --> 5438.08
way to teleport yourself somewhere while

5435.56 --> 5441.0
leaving the party with the knowledge of

5438.08 --> 5443.84
the location behind if you would choose

5441.0 --> 5446.92
to teleport or teleport to a

5443.84 --> 5449.679
location that you know but has changed

5446.92 --> 5451.88
dramatically outside of your knowledge

5449.679 --> 5454.119
you will still teleport to the location

5451.88 --> 5456.36
but there may be unforeseen consequences

5454.119 --> 5459.799999999999
like for example teleporting over a

5456.36 --> 5462.44
ravine into an active volcano or in the

5459.8 --> 5465.28
middle of a newly shaped

5462.44 --> 5467.919999999999
Mountain if that happens when you

5465.28 --> 5470.36
teleport into a solid surface this way

5467.92 --> 5473.6
you arrive at the nearest open location

5470.36 --> 5476.96
but not necessarily on a stable solid

5473.6 --> 5480.08
surface all teleported this way get

5476.96 --> 5482.52
magic damage one magic damage for 5T

5480.08 --> 5484.88
away so it can be pretty if you like in

5482.52 --> 5487.159000000001
the middle of the Mount Everest you're

5484.88 --> 5488.52
freaking dead because of the distance

5487.159 --> 5493.159
you have

5488.52 --> 5495.639
to move out away like the more off you

5493.159 --> 5498.759999999999
are where you land the more damage you

5495.639 --> 5501.719
get you can't you can't land in it it

5498.76 --> 5504.159000000001
just drains you like thins the the

5501.719 --> 5506.4800000000005
teleport signal you could say that

5504.159 --> 5509.759999999999
whatever anyway you get

5506.48 --> 5512.959999999999
damage you could appear just over cliff

5509.76 --> 5514.8
if it did happens to be closed open

5512.96 --> 5516.44
space to your original destination if

5514.8 --> 5518.52
you use teleport to teleport yourself

5516.44 --> 5520.119
and or another creature to a false

5518.52 --> 5523.6
location which technically means a

5520.119 --> 5527.28
location that has never existed or does

5523.6 --> 5529.360000000001
not yet exist in its known form like a

5527.28 --> 5532.5599999999995
location produced by a false Vision or

5529.36 --> 5535.839999999999
foresight spell teleport spell randomly

5532.56 --> 5539.4400000000005
sends you and or your target one mile

5535.84 --> 5541.88
per castle level away so it's like a

5539.44 --> 5543.5599999999995
errorink you go somewhere but not

5541.88 --> 5548.639
location because it doesn't

5543.56 --> 5551.1990000000005
exist horizontal very important not

5548.639 --> 5553.56
vertical this could also result in being

5551.199 --> 5556.5599999999995
teleported into a mountain yeah it's

5553.56 --> 5559.080000000001
basically repeating that

5556.56 --> 5561.719
part

5559.08 --> 5563.92
uh yeah you cannot use teleport to

5561.719 --> 5565.76
teleport a certain distance in a

5563.92 --> 5567.639
specific

5565.76 --> 5569.719
Direction cuz that's what you would

5567.639 --> 5572.56
think to do right it's like oh just

5569.719 --> 5575.44
teleport 5 miles that way no oh no it

5572.56 --> 5579.84
doesn't work that way you can only use

5575.44 --> 5579.839999999999
teleport to move to locations that you

5580.52 --> 5587.639
know that includes vaguely see in the

5583.639 --> 5589.639
distance so if you can see it then you

5587.639 --> 5591.56
can go there if there's a mountain in

5589.639 --> 5592.92
between you can teleport to the other

5591.56 --> 5594.92
side of the mountain you could

5592.92 --> 5596.84
potentially teleport on top of the

5594.92 --> 5598.4800000000005
mountain go to the other side of the

5596.84 --> 5602.6
mountain and teleport down because you

5598.48 --> 5605.44
now can see all of there see this works

5602.6 --> 5607.1990000000005
see how now it doesn't just break all

5605.44 --> 5608.96
the game it's like oh I just want to go

5607.199 --> 5612.48
to the end oh you go to the end ploop

5608.96 --> 5619.04
you're there yeah game lost all for

5612.48 --> 5619.04
nothing no no you it's very specific

5619.239 --> 5624.08
now right there's no size limit with

5621.639 --> 5626.8
teleport but you cannot take with you

5624.08 --> 5628.639
anything you cannot carry with you this

5626.8 --> 5631.04
includes equipment in your backpack on

5628.639 --> 5633.0
your belt in your hands clothing you're

5631.04 --> 5636.6
wearing you you cannot take an object

5633.0 --> 5638.96
with you just by touching it as you cast

5636.6 --> 5641.0
a spell even if you could technically

5638.96 --> 5643.4800000000005
carry it you have to carry it while

5641.0 --> 5645.52
casting teleport to be able to take it

5643.48 --> 5647.959999999999
with you only thing you can take with

5645.52 --> 5650.96
you that doesn't require carrying are

5647.96 --> 5654.119
other creatures other creatures can also

5650.96 --> 5657.159
take with them what they can carry and

5654.119 --> 5659.599999999999
there's no size limit to the creatures

5657.159 --> 5661.759999999999
the Caster is able to take with them so

5659.6 --> 5663.56
that's like an interesting sour of

5661.76 --> 5666.4800000000005
loophole that's not really a loophole

5663.56 --> 5670.320000000001
but yeah a teleporter is probably going

5666.48 --> 5673.119
to be like a nerd character like a just

5670.32 --> 5674.719
an elf or something or a human not

5673.119 --> 5676.5199999999995
prominent right but you want to take a

5674.719 --> 5681.199
lot of stuff with you

5676.52 --> 5683.639
well get a giant and asking hey giant

5681.199 --> 5686.28
could you please take this stuff and

5683.639 --> 5689.4400000000005
pick it up like could you like pick up

5686.28 --> 5692.4
this car just carry this car for me with

5689.44 --> 5694.36
you oh okay and then you literally touch

5692.4 --> 5696.119
him teleport him with you and now you

5694.36 --> 5699.28
teleported the entire car while you

5696.119 --> 5701.92
could never carry that car you

5699.28 --> 5704.599999999999
see but if you can find something that

5701.92 --> 5707.04
can carry it then you can teleport that

5704.6 --> 5709.84
person and thus the object they can

5707.04 --> 5713.76
carry so that's

5709.84 --> 5715.639
exactly the total detailed definition of

5713.76 --> 5719.2390000000005
how the teleport spell

5715.639 --> 5719.2390000000005
Works my trolls and

5719.8 --> 5724.52
tyrants all right sorry to board you all

us what was that you just read that's my

5802.4 --> 5807.92
book that I wrote like 15 years

5810.28 --> 5819.759999999999
ago it's my Dungeons and Dragons rule

5814.48 --> 5819.759999999999
book D it didn't you know that I wrote

5823.76 --> 5831.320000000001
that yeah dogs would be going up yeah

5826.56 --> 5831.320000000001
too bad for you cuz it's going to

5831.679 --> 5835.96
happen is it

5833.92 --> 5839.4400000000005
consistent what do you mean is it

5835.96 --> 5839.44
consistent what is what

5840.199 --> 5843.199
consistent

5862.28 --> 5866.84
those rules I was reading

5865.04 --> 5870.239
duh I

5866.84 --> 5873.84
rewrote most of the text in my entire

5870.239 --> 5876.4
project at least 20

5873.84 --> 5880.04
times yeah it's

5876.4 --> 5883.08
consistent I mean I wrote this thing

5880.04 --> 5886.28
like it's it's like a constitution or

5883.08 --> 5889.92
something CU it kind of

5886.28 --> 5894.239
is it's the constitution of like how the

5889.92 --> 5898.08
reality of this realm of this game

5894.239 --> 5902.32
works and I made sure to design it as

5898.08 --> 5904.199
consistent as possible and to close all

5902.32 --> 5905.84
the loopholes all the

5904.199 --> 5909.48
cheating

5905.84 --> 5910.28
abilities and make it really reliable

5909.48 --> 5915.919999999999
and

5910.28 --> 5915.92
logical by imposing very durable

5916.239 --> 5919.239
limitations

5923.719 --> 5929.679
right and I made everything like this

5927.04 --> 5929.679
everything about

5930.119 --> 5933.119
it

5934.4 --> 5939.719
I bet you'll love the

5936.36 --> 5942.44
Arsenal teret because the Arsenal is

5939.719 --> 5943.76
like the complete works of all Weaponry

5942.44 --> 5946.638999999999
in Dungeons and

5943.76 --> 5949.320000000001
Dragons yes it's its own book because

5946.639 --> 5952.84
there's that many

5949.32 --> 5952.84
weapons crazy

5954.32 --> 5957.719
amount how do

5959.159 --> 5963.04
I how does that work

5969.159 --> 5974.4
how do you fit double

5971.719 --> 5976.92
pages I want to do a double Pages thing

5974.4 --> 5976.92
how does that

5980.159 --> 5988.5199999999995
work CU it sucks it's oh I could

5983.32 --> 5988.5199999999995
potentially just show you the the actual

5990.04 --> 5994.32
book

5992.199 --> 5997.0
extra logical you should get right no

5994.32 --> 5999.36
Brian's logic is not into that at all he

5997.0 --> 5999.36
doesn't

5999.48 --> 6005.08
care and dude like you really think

6002.679 --> 6009.719
Bran's logic is going to read through

6005.08 --> 6012.639
like a thousand pages of game rule book

6009.719 --> 6014.92
for what what is he going to achieve

6012.639 --> 6019.1990000000005
that with that doing

6014.92 --> 6019.1990000000005
that when he's not even playing

6019.96 --> 6022.96
it

6025.0 --> 6028.96
no I don't need it extra logical

6035.56 --> 6039.76
thanks right that's nonsense

6049.92 --> 6052.92
look

6058.88 --> 6061.97
[Music]

so must be crazy rich person maybe

6235.599 --> 6238.119000000001
a little

6259.599 --> 6264.749
bit

6261.72 --> 6264.749000000001
[Music]

6268.28 --> 6271.42
[Music]

6307.599 --> 6309.84
right

6313.719 --> 6318.4800000000005
anyhow yeah was fun for me at least

6316.119 --> 6321.5599999999995
going through the DND stuff a lot of you

6318.48 --> 6324.678999999999
might out there might be super bored now

6321.56 --> 6324.679
but I mean tough

6324.92 --> 6331.84
luck somebody brought it

6327.8 --> 6331.84
up and I'm going to talk about

6331.96 --> 6336.0
it I'm really proud of my

6341.36 --> 6345.04
work right I

6345.719 --> 6352.44
mean I should just like give you like

6349.48 --> 6355.0
the original teleport description the

6352.44 --> 6358.638999999999
original spells description just so you

6355.0 --> 6361.52
could compare like what I made out of it

6358.639 --> 6366.28
and what they had then you would judge

6361.52 --> 6366.280000000001
if if I actually improved it or

6379.4 --> 6382.4
not

6384.719 --> 6389.599
it's just as long except it

6391.599 --> 6395.28
sucks it's not

6409.4 --> 6412.4
specific

6429.48 --> 6433.759999999999
wow there's a lot of more stuff in there

6432.44 --> 6435.678999999999
I'm not going to read it out it's way

6433.76 --> 6438.84
too

6435.679 --> 6441.719
big yeah they had this weird off chance

6438.84 --> 6444.88
thing like oh you throw a random die and

6441.719 --> 6447.88
if it goes wrong you get like massive

6444.88 --> 6447.88
damage

6453.44 --> 6459.04
what I think they probably did that

6455.719 --> 6462.119
because of it was too strong but I mean

6459.04 --> 6465.48
there's literally no like you can

6462.119 --> 6467.719
literally just spell instantly transport

6465.48 --> 6471.44
you to a designated

6467.719 --> 6475.08
destination or in other words

6471.44 --> 6477.678999999999
like wherever you say whether you know

6475.08 --> 6480.199
it don't know it it's not even involved

6477.679 --> 6483.76
in the thing right so I made

6480.199 --> 6487.5599999999995
teleportation knowing dependent which is

6483.76 --> 6491.76
awesome if you really think about it cuz

6487.56 --> 6495.119000000001
now you can't break the entire game the

6491.76 --> 6496.88
story whatever with teleport like you're

6495.119 --> 6499.239
just going to have to go by knowledge

6496.88 --> 6501.8
even if you have teleport you can't just

6499.239 --> 6503.678999999999
immediately solve or cheat your way

6501.8 --> 6506.88
through with everything you still have

6503.679 --> 6508.639
to know the places you can't just

6506.88 --> 6511.119
teleport to the end if you don't know

6508.639 --> 6511.119
where that

6513.679 --> 6516.679
is

6528.08 --> 6532.719
uh yeah I thought it wasn't nasty old

6535.119 --> 6538.719
teleport D and D is like water boarding

6537.719 --> 6543.08
to

6538.719 --> 6543.08
you okay

6546.44 --> 6551.04
cool I mean it can be you know it all

6549.599 --> 6553.0
depends on how you're going to do it if

6551.04 --> 6555.76
you're just going to be surrounded by a

6553.0 --> 6558.159
bunch of [Â __Â ] gay nerds that are like

6555.76 --> 6561.159000000001
oh no I want to play the play The Goofy

6558.159 --> 6562.638999999999
character my character is so goofy H

6561.159 --> 6564.5199999999995
yeah then it's just going to be that all

6562.639 --> 6566.159000000001
the time and like nothing is

6564.52 --> 6568.88
accomplished except for a bunch of

6566.159 --> 6571.719
giggly [Â __Â ] that are just [Â __Â ]

6568.88 --> 6574.32
around all the time and just oh this is

6571.719 --> 6576.2390000000005
so funny yeah that's I get it that's

6574.32 --> 6578.48
kind of

6576.239 --> 6581.879999999999
annoying but if your players are

6578.48 --> 6585.598999999999
actually like not just being

6581.88 --> 6586.96
[Â __Â ] and can just like really take

6585.599 --> 6589.4800000000005
the character

6586.96 --> 6592.04
serious then Dungeons and Dragons

6589.48 --> 6594.678999999999
actually kind of

6592.04 --> 6598.0
epic but if everybody's just [Â __Â ]

6594.679 --> 6601.2390000000005
lame and gay yeah then it sucks really

6598.0 --> 6605.08
[Â __Â ] sucks playing D and D with an

6601.239 --> 6607.28
shw is like torture that that is literal

6605.08 --> 6609.159
waterboarding like nothing in the world

6607.28 --> 6613.0
sucks more than playing Dungeons and

6609.159 --> 6616.159
Dragons with an sjw I know because I

6613.0 --> 6619.08
have and it did

6616.159 --> 6621.0
suck and they were like oh no it can be

6619.08 --> 6623.4
fun oh look I'm doing my best to make it

6621.0 --> 6626.08
more fun yeah it isn't

6623.4 --> 6628.679
though it just isn't it's just more

6626.08 --> 6630.679
elaborate not funny it's not fun it's

6628.679 --> 6633.4800000000005
not cool it's just more

6630.679 --> 6636.36
elaborate there's no soul in it because

6633.48 --> 6638.199
you refuse to accept what is what and

6636.36 --> 6641.199
how things are and what is right and

6638.199 --> 6643.079
what is wrong fundamentally and then if

6641.199 --> 6645.28
you're going to play by that standard in

6643.079 --> 6648.599
that game yeah then nothing means

6645.28 --> 6650.679
anything I know I know nothing means

6648.599 --> 6653.0
anything if you can't accept what is

6650.679 --> 6653.84
good is good and what is bad is bad yeah

6653.0 --> 6656.52
I know

6653.84 --> 6658.1990000000005
sjw yeah dungeon and Dragons doesn't

6656.52 --> 6660.320000000001
make any [Â __Â ] sense then either it's

6658.199 --> 6662.719
all pointless isn't it cuz you just

6660.32 --> 6665.48
refuse to accept what is

6662.719 --> 6667.639
what so yeah playing dungeon dragons

6665.48 --> 6670.159
with the NW

6667.639 --> 6672.36
sucks but playing it with people that

6670.159 --> 6675.04
take their characters very serious and

6672.36 --> 6677.598999999999
that really get into the virtual realm

6675.04 --> 6680.599
of it and not just bunch of giggly

6677.599 --> 6683.4800000000005
[Â __Â ] wasting everybody's time

6680.599 --> 6687.639
then it's [Â __Â ]

6683.48 --> 6691.239
awesome trust me I'm a game master I've

6687.639 --> 6694.4400000000005
done that I'm a really good game master

6691.239 --> 6696.5599999999995
even though I improvise a lot of it but

6694.44 --> 6699.159
if I'm good at one thing it is getting

6696.56 --> 6700.679
everybody into that realm into that

6699.159 --> 6704.879999999999
place into the

6700.679 --> 6708.04
lore because all my world have lore and

6704.88 --> 6710.679
a lot of that lore is actually vague is

6708.04 --> 6713.32
like in a Quantum flux type of State

6710.679 --> 6715.52
as in I know there's something I just

6713.32 --> 6717.639
don't know what it is yet it's up to the

6715.52 --> 6721.400000000001
players whether they're curious enough

6717.639 --> 6724.119
to reach out and make it manifest where

6721.4 --> 6725.799999999999
only there's a suggestion before that in

6724.119 --> 6727.719
the back of my mind like yeah I know

6725.8 --> 6730.639
there's something there and could play

6727.719 --> 6732.96
around it for like years and never even

6730.639 --> 6735.4400000000005
manifesting and never solidifying what

6732.96 --> 6737.679
that is but I know there's something

6735.44 --> 6740.598999999999
there and then

6737.679 --> 6742.56
later it gets to that point and now it's

6740.599 --> 6744.4800000000005
it's turn and oh guess what that thing

6742.56 --> 6746.92
that I always knew was there but never

6744.48 --> 6749.159
actually helped manifest never really

6746.92 --> 6751.8
solidified now suddenly become

6749.159 --> 6755.5599999999995
solidified now it

6751.8 --> 6757.639
becomes something real that that the

6755.56 --> 6760.360000000001
players could actually bump into and do

6757.639 --> 6765.52
something with and that's how I work as

6760.36 --> 6765.5199999999995
a gay Master gay Master

6768.079 --> 6774.36
thanks did I play magic together yeah

6771.52 --> 6776.360000000001
yes played it a lot I don't really play

6774.36 --> 6779.36
it anymore now

6776.36 --> 6779.36
but

6781.76 --> 6786.159000000001
yeah play as different comic yeah and

6784.199 --> 6789.239
that's why I'm never playing Dungeons

6786.159 --> 6792.799999999999
and Dragons with you akumu virus exactly

6789.239 --> 6792.799999999999
because of that statement right

6798.76 --> 6801.76
there

6808.92 --> 6814.4400000000005
yeah a yeah that's right a but hey if

6812.48 --> 6816.759999999999
you want to be like a Super Saiyan you

6814.44 --> 6819.96
can in this

6816.76 --> 6822.320000000001
game I got a special Prestige CL just

6819.96 --> 6825.52
for that so you can do exactly what

6822.32 --> 6828.759999999999
freaking Super Saiyans

6825.52 --> 6831.079000000001
do yell very loud build up a lot of

6828.76 --> 6832.400000000001
power discharge all that power in one

6831.079 --> 6835.4
giant

6832.4 --> 6835.4
blast

6837.0 --> 6843.92
yeah I made a class specifically just so

6840.56 --> 6846.4800000000005
you could do that and you can fly too by

6843.92 --> 6846.4800000000005
the way in

6851.48 --> 6855.44
that did I call it

6858.679 --> 6861.679
again

6868.159 --> 6871.44
sacred fist that's

6872.88 --> 6879.079
right yeah sacred fist in the prestige

6875.56 --> 6882.0
class original sacred fist [Â __Â ] lame

6879.079 --> 6884.719
[Â __Â ] completely [Â __Â ]

6882.0 --> 6886.639
useless yeah that's why I thought oh

6884.719 --> 6889.2390000000005
yeah let's just actually make something

6886.639 --> 6892.88
that's really freaking cool out of it

6889.239 --> 6897.36
and it's still balanced enough so the

6892.88 --> 6897.36
sacred fist in a way kind of is a glass

6898.8 --> 6904.76
Cannon when you start expanding your

6901.56 --> 6907.56
power like when you actually use it tap

6904.76 --> 6910.280000000001
into it becomes extremely powerful but

6907.56 --> 6910.280000000001
then you become

6918.599 --> 6921.599
exhausted

6925.92 --> 6930.639
yeah so you you want

6928.0 --> 6932.44
that you want to be a Super Saiyan you

6930.639 --> 6933.2390000000005
can be in this Dungeons and Dragons in

6932.44 --> 6935.879999999999
my

6933.239 --> 6939.32
book you want to play the pirate of the

6935.88 --> 6942.4800000000005
Caribbeans pick your type of pirate you

6939.32 --> 6946.5199999999995
can be any form you

6942.48 --> 6951.598999999999
wish like think about it's there like

6946.52 --> 6951.599
from Peter Pan to

6951.76 --> 6960.280000000001
like yeah to pirates of the Caren Bean

6955.199 --> 6963.079
style literally like it's there it's all

6960.28 --> 6965.599
there you want to do that you can do

6963.079 --> 6968.0
that you want to do it different you can

6965.599 --> 6968.0
do it

6971.199 --> 6978.44
different you want to play a drunken

6974.0 --> 6980.599
master yeah like a Kung Fu guy that

6978.44 --> 6982.598999999999
really fights well under alcohol it's

6980.599 --> 6985.159000000001
orig the class I didn't even invent that

6982.599 --> 6988.599
class by the way that was that was

6985.159 --> 6990.92
already there I just made it even more

6988.599 --> 6993.360000000001
awesome the original was already pretty

6990.92 --> 6995.079
cool like the idea of it is cool

6993.36 --> 6997.36
especially now that there's that Jackie

6995.079 --> 7000.239
Chad movie

6997.36 --> 7003.44
right Jackie Chan movie Drunken Master

7000.239 --> 7005.799999999999
is awesome it's

7003.44 --> 7008.5199999999995
hilarious and there's literally a

7005.8 --> 7011.719
dungeon dragons class made after that

7008.52 --> 7015.2390000000005
except if it was not very elaborate no I

7011.719 --> 7015.2390000000005
made it very

7016.8 --> 7019.8
elaborate

7024.76 --> 7028.96
yeah oh yeah and then for example we

7027.079 --> 7032.719
have things like Dragon Disciple oh

7028.96 --> 7035.52
Dragon Disciple classic Dungeons and

7032.719 --> 7038.4800000000005
Dragons class thing that's been there

7035.52 --> 7039.96
for a very very very long time since

7038.48 --> 7042.4
like dungeon dragon

7039.96 --> 7043.84
one like oh you can become like a

7042.4 --> 7045.839999999999
follower of the Dragon you have it in

7043.84 --> 7048.32
your blood and then you become a little

7045.84 --> 7052.28
bit of dragon and that's a

7048.32 --> 7054.4
thing I'm not super I was not never

7052.28 --> 7056.04
really super impressed but I thought

7054.4 --> 7059.96
like yeah why don't you just make the

7056.04 --> 7064.4
Dragon Disciple as in you literally over

7059.96 --> 7066.8
time transform completely into a dragon

7064.4 --> 7068.36
it's just you just gradually transform

7066.8 --> 7071.8
you can stop the transformation you can

7068.36 --> 7074.759999999999
choose like okay I'm not going to go any

7071.8 --> 7077.159000000001
further away from my original

7074.76 --> 7079.52
race or you could just say yeah [Â __Â ] it

7077.159 --> 7081.48
I'm just going to become a full Dragon

7079.52 --> 7083.639
screw you

7081.48 --> 7086.959999999999
guys I'm doing

7083.639 --> 7089.4400000000005
it but now there's that option and you

7086.96 --> 7092.719
can literally just attain the full power

7089.44 --> 7094.759999999999
of a a full Dragon which is like the

7092.719 --> 7098.28
pretty much the most prominent powers in

7094.76 --> 7101.1990000000005
the games in the game and you can become

7098.28 --> 7105.32
that you have to like grow it to Epic

7101.199 --> 7107.678999999999
class level but I mean you can do that

7105.32 --> 7109.04
now instead of like oh so cool if you

7107.679 --> 7111.079
could do that yeah you can never do that

7109.04 --> 7114.96
yeah now you can you can actually just

7111.079 --> 7116.639
do that you literally in this can become

7114.96 --> 7120.84
pretty much anything you

7116.639 --> 7123.639
want for real and now it has a

7120.84 --> 7126.04
balance like it's actually a purposeful

7123.639 --> 7127.639
balance to it not just oh I can be this

7126.04 --> 7130.079
oh because it's cool and funny and

7127.639 --> 7133.1990000000005
exceptional and all the world is ruined

7130.079 --> 7135.44
move on yeah instead of that now there's

7133.199 --> 7139.0
actually like you can become those

7135.44 --> 7139.0
things and there's a logic behind

7144.4 --> 7148.598999999999
it you think there were ever any animals

7147.159 --> 7151.44
that were similar to dragons in real

7148.599 --> 7151.4400000000005
life yeah

7151.76 --> 7157.76
plenty I think there were like giant

7154.599 --> 7161.52
reptiles that were very quick and very

7157.76 --> 7163.92
vicious and people were extremely elated

7161.52 --> 7165.52
when they were finally exterminated

7163.92 --> 7167.76
because they were terrible creatures

7165.52 --> 7169.88
probably that would just like start

7167.76 --> 7172.400000000001
running into Village and then like kill

7169.88 --> 7175.04
like 20 30 people and run away

7172.4 --> 7177.879999999999
again something like it probably was

7175.04 --> 7181.92
kind of like that they were probably

7177.88 --> 7184.599
very hated reptilian Predator

7181.92 --> 7187.159
creatures like dinosaurs yeah except

7184.599 --> 7188.2390000000005
they're not [Â __Â ] and they would be

7187.159 --> 7189.799999999999
way more

7188.239 --> 7193.718999999999
dangerous

7189.8 --> 7195.88
like not bag back leg walking giant

7193.719 --> 7198.44
reptile chickens right which is what

7195.88 --> 7199.2390000000005
dinosaurs really are they're all based

7198.44 --> 7200.759999999999
on

7199.239 --> 7204.598999999999
chickens

7200.76 --> 7206.679
literally but like more like giant

7204.599 --> 7210.119000000001
iuas

7206.679 --> 7213.8
giant on all four walking big lizards

7210.119 --> 7216.679
that were really sick sickeningly quick

7213.8 --> 7220.28
like very quick for their

7216.679 --> 7222.96
size and that was probably why yeah

7220.28 --> 7227.0
everybody just like a dragon ah quickly

7222.96 --> 7227.0
in your houses close the

7227.719 --> 7232.36
doors and like nobody would fight it

7230.28 --> 7234.5199999999995
because it would probably be so freaking

7232.36 --> 7239.88
quick as soon as you through that spear

7234.52 --> 7239.88
it already bit your leg off in the

7241.28 --> 7248.4
sweep bigger than humans

7245.159 --> 7249.839999999999
yeah but I mean it's very likely they

7248.4 --> 7252.719
were like

7249.84 --> 7258.4800000000005
stegosaurus sized kind of as an

7252.719 --> 7261.8
indicator and people wrote them I

7258.48 --> 7264.119
mean not there would have been multiple

7261.8 --> 7266.28
types of reptiles some which were really

7264.119 --> 7268.799999999999
feral and super dangerous and others

7266.28 --> 7272.079
which were a bit more mild and they were

7268.8 --> 7272.079000000001
probably used as riding

7273.28 --> 7280.44
animals fire breathing

7277.159 --> 7282.679
nope some of them have made had like

7280.44 --> 7286.04
acid where they would just

7282.679 --> 7289.52
like and you would get like it would

7286.04 --> 7293.0
just start burning and dissolving you

7289.52 --> 7296.2390000000005
that probably did exist and would feel

7293.0 --> 7299.36
like you're being burned by fire but not

7296.239 --> 7299.36
literal fire

7308.04 --> 7311.04
though

7312.84 --> 7319.639
it would be very cool though I mean the

7315.52 --> 7322.2390000000005
idea is pretty magical right like

7319.639 --> 7325.719
Fireball oh it looks so

7322.239 --> 7329.04
cool and who knows man maybe that did

7325.719 --> 7331.8
actually exist in some

7329.04 --> 7335.5199999999995
way but not like

7331.8 --> 7339.84
common big predators or something that's

7335.52 --> 7343.280000000001
because that would just be too dangerous

7339.84 --> 7345.719
right I mean if it's a big quick

7343.28 --> 7347.239
reptile that can just hunt very quickly

7345.719 --> 7349.76
that's terrifying but you lock yourself

7347.239 --> 7353.04
in the house and then it's like doable

7349.76 --> 7356.8
if the freaking creature can burn things

7353.04 --> 7359.599
down then like how long can that be

7356.8 --> 7362.360000000001
sustained it's like once a creature

7359.599 --> 7365.360000000001
comes out and starts doing that you must

7362.36 --> 7369.88
immediately kill it at all costs or

7365.36 --> 7372.28
everybody will die see it's not durable

7369.88 --> 7375.32
it can never be balanced that way it can

7372.28 --> 7378.4
never sustain the test of time it's like

7375.32 --> 7379.119
it will just force everybody's hand to

7378.4 --> 7382.799999999999
be

7379.119 --> 7384.639
it die or survive

7382.8 --> 7389.159000000001
scenario

7384.639 --> 7389.159000000001
immediately you get fire is way too

7397.88 --> 7404.2390000000005
dangerous

7400.48 --> 7406.959999999999
right but maybe some of them did have

7404.239 --> 7408.919999999999
like a fire thing I don't know man I

7406.96 --> 7410.96
don't know I don't think it was like

7408.92 --> 7413.4800000000005
common

7410.96 --> 7416.32
though wonder how they became extinct

7413.48 --> 7418.44
they were hunted down and slaughtered

7416.32 --> 7421.44
every last one of

7418.44 --> 7423.719
them people were sick of getting

7421.44 --> 7424.638999999999
suddenly raided by a bunch of reptiles

7423.719 --> 7429.4
that would

7424.639 --> 7430.96
just rub children like eggs

7429.4 --> 7434.159
and

7430.96 --> 7434.159
[Â __Â ] you

7443.559 --> 7450.1990000000005
know

7446.32 --> 7450.199
so yeah how

7457.8 --> 7460.8
else

7466.96 --> 7471.679
you're talking about falor what are you

7469.44 --> 7474.079
talking about Tommy is anybody else

7471.679 --> 7476.4800000000005
still is anybody with a wrench still

7474.079 --> 7479.96
here someone moon buggy thanks for

7476.48 --> 7482.799999999999
reminding me about the D thing teret you

7479.96 --> 7486.199
still here Richard G you still here

7482.8 --> 7490.76
anybody still here I it's cool just

7486.199 --> 7490.759999999999
talking with Luke Kramer and all but

7502.119 --> 7509.239
Tommy you don't need to know if you

7505.92 --> 7509.2390000000005
don't know then you don't need to

7513.32 --> 7520.84
know maybe some sort of

7516.679 --> 7522.88
no no disease has extinct extincted

7520.84 --> 7526.719
anything

7522.88 --> 7526.719
ever it's not how that

7529.199 --> 7533.719
works doing some exercise oh

7537.8 --> 7541.05
[Music]

7547.679 --> 7550.679
okay

7556.36 --> 7563.92
no besides yeah reptiles don't typically

7560.159 --> 7568.119
die from diseases but they can succumb

7563.92 --> 7571.36
to fungi typically did you know that

7568.119 --> 7574.079
like reptiles are more vulnerable to

7571.36 --> 7577.079
fungus which they don't have so many

7574.079 --> 7579.799999999999
issues with in the normal places they

7577.079 --> 7582.599
live where it's really hot and

7579.8 --> 7584.679
dry but as soon as you like take them

7582.599 --> 7587.28
out of that type of climate into a more

7584.679 --> 7591.96
moderate climate they will become more

7587.28 --> 7591.96
vulnerable to fungi did you know

7607.04 --> 7613.679
that didn't not know that that

7610.559 --> 7615.92
yeah snakes have the same issues

7613.679 --> 7619.2390000000005
salamanders all those types of reptiles

7615.92 --> 7619.2390000000005
they all get issues with

7628.239 --> 7633.199
fungi cuz they just don't handle moist

7630.96 --> 7633.199
very

7637.52 --> 7640.52
well

7645.679 --> 7650.599
right so the reptiles don't just oh they

7648.28 --> 7652.36
were the ones that survived in the Heat

7650.599 --> 7653.76
and so they're still there no they

7652.36 --> 7657.598999999999
actually need

7653.76 --> 7661.2390000000005
it because they don't respond well to

7657.599 --> 7664.559
moist air and all

7661.239 --> 7666.919999999999
that snakes with athletes well sounds

7664.559 --> 7669.320000000001
like a joke but that's kind of literal

7666.92 --> 7671.4400000000005
yeah they don't have the foot but they

7669.32 --> 7674.799999999999
do get the

7671.44 --> 7679.199
fungus and they can actually get that I

7674.8 --> 7682.52
think even from humans I heard or if I

7679.199 --> 7682.5199999999995
remember correctly that

7687.719 --> 7691.4
is right there you

7697.44 --> 7700.44
go

7702.559 --> 7707.88
yeah thanks I yeah I talk to PE this I

7705.559 --> 7709.84
know this because I talk to people that

7707.88 --> 7711.2390000000005
know about reptiles that are really

7709.84 --> 7713.4400000000005
interested and they shared their

7711.239 --> 7714.839999999999
knowledge with me and I remember that

7713.44 --> 7717.839999999999
sort of thing because that's like

7714.84 --> 7720.52
specialist knowledge very feel very

7717.84 --> 7722.88
lucky to have known somebody that shared

7720.52 --> 7722.88
that with

7723.84 --> 7730.400000000001
me to catch athletes food with no foot

7727.84 --> 7730.400000000001
yeah

7757.32 --> 7760.32
is

7768.28 --> 7773.159
ah Daughters of vet not not treat

7770.079 --> 7776.199
reptiles yeah it takes a different type

7773.159 --> 7779.799999999999
like reptile doctors and like cat and

7776.199 --> 7781.879999999999
dog cat and dog doctors are different

7779.8 --> 7784.360000000001
reptiles are like their physiology is

7781.88 --> 7784.36
just very

7784.8 --> 7790.320000000001
different

7787.32 --> 7790.32
obviously

7799.079 --> 7805.199
like from what I understood also like

7801.639 --> 7807.76
reptiles heal much more tough like when

7805.199 --> 7812.799999999999
a reptile gets wounded it doesn't heal

7807.76 --> 7812.8
as easily as like a typical mammal

7814.04 --> 7819.92
does it's more dangerous to a reptile to

7817.0 --> 7822.199
get wounded

7819.92 --> 7825.4400000000005
except for like salamanders losing their

7822.199 --> 7828.719
tail or something they can regrow that

7825.44 --> 7828.719
but I don't

7832.96 --> 7837.8
know maybe it's not all reptiles I'm not

7847.239 --> 7851.5199999999995
sure

7849.76 --> 7854.4800000000005
I'm not sure about that actually I don't

7851.52 --> 7854.4800000000005
know even I

7854.559 --> 7857.76
don't I

7858.48 --> 7863.199
wonder wonder how I'm goingon to figure

7861.0 --> 7863.199
that

7871.239 --> 7877.159
out got a masic turtle while

7874.599 --> 7880.159000000001
fishing yeah that's

7877.159 --> 7880.159
sad

7880.44 --> 7883.478999999999
[Music]

7896.0 --> 7902.84
yes I knew it I freaking called it man

7900.52 --> 7906.92
yeah so reptiles and

7902.84 --> 7911.28
amphibian typically have slower

7906.92 --> 7913.599
healing I called it so getting wounded

7911.28 --> 7915.92
for a reptile is much more dangerous

7913.599 --> 7919.360000000001
compared to like

7915.92 --> 7921.2390000000005
mammals I totally called it man I just

7919.36 --> 7923.44
have all this knowledge and I don't even

7921.239 --> 7926.36
know where I get

7923.44 --> 7929.119
it I just know this

7926.36 --> 7931.5199999999995

to an end isn't it very

8105.88 --> 8111.28
quick I can't believe it's almost

8111.88 --> 8119.36
over it's just that I'm starting to have

8115.559 --> 8122.639
real trouble like it doesn't feel really

8119.36 --> 8126.558999999999
all that different to like 2013 to me in

8122.639 --> 8131.1990000000005
a way like time scale wise I mean a lot

8126.559 --> 8131.1990000000005
of things have happened of course

8131.36 --> 8140.719
but like it could literally be 2013 and

8136.8 --> 8140.719
I wouldn't really be able to tell the

8141.52 --> 8145.76
difference is anybody else having

8146.8 --> 8149.8
that

8162.04 --> 8166.04
the [Â __Â ] this for

8176.719 --> 8179.719
slowo

8180.52 --> 8182.84
the

8186.76 --> 8192.599
[Â __Â ] skinny skinny nipping

8190.559 --> 8194.479
sucks like why the hell would you do

8192.599 --> 8197.679
that anyway unless there was like a

8194.479 --> 8200.639
naked check with you that's

8197.679 --> 8206.28
nice but

8200.639 --> 8209.679

8219.559 --> 8223.16
of any kind it's

8221.87 --> 8227.240000000002
[Music]

8223.16 --> 8227.24
like I don't know about

8231.76 --> 8236.479
that I mean you really have to know

8234.08 --> 8236.479
what's

8236.599 --> 8239.599
there

8266.599 --> 8269.599

8293.2 --> 8300.599
fireworks here I love doing

8296.359 --> 8302.479000000001
that and and I'm going to have a beer

8300.599 --> 8306.84
let's see if the yeah I might not even

8302.479 --> 8311.039999999999
drink it but I did buy it just in

8306.84 --> 8315.92
case and just have a New Year's toast

8311.04 --> 8315.92

8318.679 --> 8322.639
there I'll remind you again

8326.519 --> 8329.519
tomorrow

8333.679 --> 8340.88
yeah they hey Di for Navy F good to see

8336.96 --> 8344.88
you again it's been a while but yeah

8340.88 --> 8347.8
definitely I I'll take sharks over like

8344.88 --> 8347.8
hippos any

8349.24 --> 8357.92
day I mean seriously if you like fall

8354.12 --> 8360.12
off a cliff in the water in Africa and

8357.92 --> 8361.76
on one side there's hippos and on the

8360.12 --> 8363.880000000001
other side there's

8361.76 --> 8365.28
crocodiles I'm going to sit on the side

8363.88 --> 8369.759999999998
of the

8365.28 --> 8369.76
crocodiles I'll take my chances with

8371.359 --> 8377.92
them that not much of a chance by the

8374.28 --> 8377.92
way but seriously it's like

8380.319 --> 8386.439
yeah but I mean the crocodiles would

8383.16 --> 8389.439
probably flee from the

8386.439 --> 8389.439
hippos

8395.88 --> 8401.279999999999
and besides sharks like sharks are not

8399.04 --> 8403.880000000001
really that much of a threat unless they

8401.28 --> 8407.28
just happen to be really hungry or had

8403.88 --> 8410.72
just recently tasted fresh blood that

8407.28 --> 8414.08
can be problematic but even then

8410.72 --> 8417.039999999999
like unless they're like

8414.08 --> 8419.359
ravenous they rarely do anything more

8417.04 --> 8421.160000000002
than just take a nibble and nip at you

8419.359 --> 8425.800000000001
or

8421.16 --> 8425.8
something shark attacks are really

8428.68 --> 8436.6
rare you're like orcas are way more

8431.92 --> 8436.6
dangerous than sharks you know that

8444.04 --> 8450.84
right yeah and hippos but the hippos are

8447.0 --> 8453.92
just freaky sadist hippos are sadistic

8450.84 --> 8456.8
bastards hippos are like Nazis they're

8453.92 --> 8460.2
like everyone must

8456.8 --> 8462.479
die they look Al so

8460.2 --> 8464.960000000001
cute yeah you leave them in the wild and

8462.479 --> 8467.16
they're [Â __Â ] Nazis they're like oh

8464.96 --> 8470.039999999999
you're not a hippo well then we're going

8467.16 --> 8470.039999999999
to Stampede

8470.399 --> 8479.24
you [Â __Â ] you non hippo yeah they're

8475.08 --> 8479.24
crazy they're total Nazis

8480.28 --> 8484.720000000001
in the wild I mean when they're like in

8482.6 --> 8488.84
zoos they're probably not as much like

8484.72 --> 8488.84
that because they just don't have the

8502.76 --> 8508.12
numbers hi Parts have attitude problems

8506.24 --> 8511.359
yeah

8508.12 --> 8513.04
but the thing is is that they're just

8511.359 --> 8517.479000000001
fiercely

8513.04 --> 8517.479000000001
territorial against other

8522.319 --> 8526.84
species oh somebody let the cat in

8528.16 --> 8531.16
again

8536.16 --> 8539.16

8555.12 --> 8558.52

that who changed their

8565.8 --> 8570.319
name is that fiber outs is that

8576.319 --> 8583.479
you joined 10 hours

8580.479 --> 8583.479
ago

8584.28 --> 8587.68
what what the

8596.08 --> 8601.84
[Â __Â ]

8598.319 --> 8601.84
how the [Â __Â ] did you get a

8626.08 --> 8629.08
wrench

8651.09 --> 8654.229
[Music]

8656.0 --> 8659.0
okay

8677.96 --> 8685.96
okay so are you fiber outs Christian a I

8682.24 --> 8687.84
would like you to answer right now no

8685.96 --> 8689.839999999998
waiting

8687.84 --> 8691.76
no five [Â __Â ] minutes I want you to

8689.84 --> 8695.56
answer right

8691.76 --> 8699.12
now or I kick you out who the [Â __Â ] are

8695.56 --> 8699.119999999999
you how the hell did you get a

8703.2 --> 8708.6
wrench you got one minute to

8715.88 --> 8718.88
comply

8735.6 --> 8739.439
and you're out [Â __Â ]

8745.88 --> 8751.479
you

8748.319 --> 8751.479
how the [Â __Â ] did that

8775.8 --> 8778.8
happen

8820.88 --> 8826.08
I'm wondering because if it's Christian

8823.479 --> 8829.84
Madson that's fiber

8826.08 --> 8833.359
out that's not Christian a so I'm just

8829.84 --> 8833.359
like confused

8833.439 --> 8837.76
here and as you said made an account

8836.24 --> 8841.84
yesterday how the [Â __Â ] did he get a

8837.76 --> 8843.399
wrench that's illogical so I'm just this

8841.84 --> 8845.6
doesn't make any sense it feels like

8843.399 --> 8849.278999999999
there's somebody trying to [Â __Â ] around

8845.6 --> 8854.399000000001
again whatever they did they're banned

8849.279 --> 8854.399000000001
so that's cute but get the hell

8855.12 --> 8858.12
out

8860.04 --> 8865.68
H all right so definitely had an

8862.56 --> 8868.68
interesting show today I

8865.68 --> 8868.68
thought

8875.16 --> 8880.439
very

8877.359 --> 8882.76
varied first talking about a bunch of

8880.439 --> 8885.56
esoterics and of course like growing

8882.76 --> 8890.0
soil and the importance of

8885.56 --> 8890.0
that then we went on to like

8890.479 --> 8894.479
reptiles and then ended up with

8894.84 --> 8902.0
hippos oh yeah don't not to forget also

8898.08 --> 8905.16
my dungeon dragons book came came in

8902.0 --> 8907.0
there oh man but I mean eventually you

8905.16 --> 8909.96
just end up talking about so many things

8907.0 --> 8909.96
it just doesn't

8913.92 --> 8918.12
fit doesn't fit in a title

8925.6 --> 8928.6
anymore

8955.2 --> 8962.279
remember seeing a hip save a little deer

8958.279 --> 8966.92
from a lion when okay

8962.279 --> 8966.92
what what that's just

8967.6 --> 8973.279
weird maybe hippos just specifically

8970.88 --> 8974.679999999998
hate humans they're just like dirty

8973.279 --> 8977.720000000001
dirty

8974.68 --> 8980.16
humans maybe they just don't like humans

8977.72 --> 8983.399
and they don't mind other animals as

8980.16 --> 8985.92
much they just they might literally just

8983.399 --> 8988.439
hate humans could be maybe they think

8985.92 --> 8992.56
humans

8988.439 --> 8992.56
stink and that that's why they hate

8997.479 --> 9000.84
them I'm not

9013.16 --> 9018.68
sure right okay but I'm going to round

9015.8 --> 9022.8
