[Music]

99.84 --> 106.56
is didn't really cloud

103.159 --> 108.28
up despite the the trailing yesterday

106.56 --> 111.92
and yeah it seems like they're doing a

108.28 --> 113.96000000000001
bit of the same although not as much as

111.92 --> 116.96000000000001
yesterday but I don't think it's really

113.96 --> 116.96
going to matter all that

118.52 --> 122.399
much so

120.88 --> 124.039
wondering about the prediction if

122.399 --> 126.719
they're now going to move it further

124.039 --> 129.039
down the line the supposed storm that

126.719 --> 130.92
will be coming

129.039 --> 133.64
tomorrow we'll

130.92 --> 138.55999999999997

C

163.0 --> 168.159

apparently we'll

174.64 --> 180.79999999999998
see right in a way I'm kind of glad

178.2 --> 183.79899999999998

afternoons are just really tough to do

183.799 --> 187.28
the early bird show in the weekdays

185.68 --> 189.87900000000002
that's why I'm starting so late as I

261.39 --> 264.63
[Music]

264.639 --> 270.84000000000003
hungry right right after 12:00 I

268.479 --> 274.639
basically went

270.84 --> 274.63899999999995
having Siesta

278.52 --> 284.71999999999997
downstairs because it's the temperature

281.6 --> 284.72
is much better down

285.44 --> 291.12
there and that was

287.56 --> 293.639
great but yeah I did wake up like half

291.12 --> 293.639
an hour

296.199 --> 301.56
ago hey ter 306 good to see you

317.0 --> 321.479

328.479 --> 331.479
turret

332.92 --> 336.1
[Music]

337.56 --> 344.199
right noticing that my YouTube still

339.639 --> 344.199
keeps freezing up very very

356.479 --> 362.199
quickly I'm a bit surprised my show

359.16 --> 363.12
yeserday that they didn't get many views

362.199 --> 366.84000000000003
I

363.12 --> 370.759
I would expect it would be

366.84 --> 374.79999999999995
higher but I guess that uh people are

370.759 --> 374.8
not interested by my be Chess at

375.16 --> 378.16
all

380.96 --> 385.68
fine yeah I I just thought it would like

383.639 --> 388.28000000000003
draw some attention or something but who

385.68 --> 388.28000000000003
knows I

388.4 --> 391.4
guess

391.52 --> 395.12
I guess not oh fair

412.72 --> 421.40000000000003
enough got a g sto here too

417.84 --> 421.4
some Rula

422.199 --> 425.52000000000004
I'm going to chug it all down

445.479 --> 451.31899999999996
quickly

447.12 --> 451.319
ah watch a good game teret

451.96 --> 454.4
good for

457.11 --> 460.17900000000003
[Music]

468.52 --> 475.28
you let's see what did I do

472.28 --> 475.28
yesterday

478.319 --> 481.91900000000004
uh

480.199 --> 484.759
Quantum of conscious had a really

481.919 --> 487.44
interesting 911 video that he uploaded

484.759 --> 491.91900000000004
yesterday I watched it this

487.44 --> 495.52
morning he's so like into 9911 he

491.919 --> 498.35999999999996
like dived so deeply into it just he

495.52 --> 501.159
knows all those details it is pretty

498.36 --> 505.599
incredible also Eric

501.159 --> 511.64
dubet had this like ex psychiatrist

505.599 --> 513.919
woman on it's very interesting esoteric

511.64 --> 515.919
conversation I didn't get to watch the

513.919 --> 519.4789999999999
entirety of it but it was like really

515.919 --> 519.4789999999999
interesting very smart

523.2 --> 529.08
lady and like they questioning the

526.16 --> 529.0799999999999
nature of the

531.12 --> 537.2
DSM and trying to basically reformulate

534.24 --> 540.399
some of these

537.2 --> 544.6
effects like narcissist and

540.399 --> 544.6
psychopathy it was an interesting

545.32 --> 550.32
conversation very long by the way but I

548.36 --> 553.32
got halfway through

550.32 --> 553.32
it

568.12 --> 571.12
uh

572.68 --> 576.92
right so yeah other than that it was

574.6 --> 576.9200000000001
kind of

578.12 --> 582.0
uneventful I watch the

585.88 --> 589.88
movie finished watching a

590.32 --> 594.6800000000001
movie but uh I I thought in ways it was

593.519 --> 598.16
kind of

594.68 --> 601.959
shitty but there there was this interest

598.16 --> 604.8
this one actor in that I I do

601.959 --> 609.0
like he plays in a lot of these sci-fi

604.8 --> 609.0
surreal movies like

609.079 --> 612.079
including

612.2 --> 619.5600000000001
uh the movie that I always forget the

615.36 --> 619.5600000000001
name off every single

621.68 --> 627.399
time and I feel so stupid for forgetting

624.519 --> 627.399
it every single

627.68 --> 631.8
time like every everybody knows what I'm

629.959 --> 634.079
talking about when I say Dream Within A

631.8 --> 636.8389999999999
Dream Within a dream I always [ __ ]

634.079 --> 639.68
forget the name of that

636.839 --> 641.72
movie I know the music theme I could

639.68 --> 644.16
describe some scenes I can describe the

641.72 --> 646.1600000000001
concept I could describe so much but I

644.16 --> 649.48
always [ __ ] forget the

646.16 --> 649.48
name so

650.6 --> 655.72
stupid but he plays in that he plays

653.079 --> 658.079
another movie

655.72 --> 661.76
Loopers he plays in this one too and

658.079 --> 663.92
it's called project power and it is very

661.76 --> 666.4399999999999
as cheesy in that sense as you could

663.92 --> 666.4399999999999
imagine

668.36 --> 672.48
but it was kind of

673.92 --> 679.7199999999999
interesting

676.48 --> 684.04
but it was also

679.72 --> 685.6800000000001
terrible it was really just playing into

684.04 --> 691.4399999999999
like

685.68 --> 694.6389999999999
uh drug dealer culture [ __ ] A lot too

691.44 --> 696.519
much but the like the background story

694.639 --> 699.8
of what they were doing that was kind of

696.519 --> 703.079
like interesting in although to somebody

699.8 --> 706.16
like me that's almost like oh wow I'm I

703.079 --> 710.7199999999999
supposed to be all mind blown about

706.16 --> 714.24
that that they're testing their

710.72 --> 716.6800000000001
experimental drugs on a public making

714.24 --> 719.639
them deal it and then just to see the

716.68 --> 721.4399999999999
the results of it how well it works to

719.639 --> 726.0790000000001
sell it

721.44 --> 728.7600000000001
off so they're like oh no really a group

726.079 --> 731.92
is like dealing drugs and observing them

728.76 --> 735.56
and using them as demonstration material

731.92 --> 737.76
to sell it to like military biders and

735.56 --> 741.7199999999999
all that

737.76 --> 744.76
wow that is like nobody could have ever

741.72 --> 744.76
thought of something like

745.04 --> 750.36
that it's not like that's just straight

747.88 --> 754.8
out happening right now with

750.36 --> 754.8000000000001
the all these vaxes and all

755.68 --> 761.4399999999999
that Inception yeah that's the one I

759.12 --> 763.68
always freaking forget the name of

761.44 --> 765.48
that I mean how many times have I

763.68 --> 767.4399999999999
brought up that movie to compare with

765.48 --> 770.88
something or whatever and I always

767.44 --> 770.8800000000001
[ __ ] forget the name it's so

775.839 --> 782.2790000000001
annoying Joseph Gordon levit let's see

779.72 --> 782.279
if that's

785.519 --> 790.76
him I hope I remembered it correctly

788.24 --> 794.9590000000001
that he was a

790.76 --> 794.959
lers yeah that guy

795.279 --> 800.48
yeah I don't know I find him a very cool

797.88 --> 803.56
guy and he he always play plays

800.48 --> 806.48
interesting roles in in the movie

803.56 --> 810.76
season either really likable or like

806.48 --> 810.76
interestingly complex

815.16 --> 820.959
so it's like if I spot any kind of movie

817.72 --> 826.1990000000001
and he is in it then it's like okay then

820.959 --> 826.199
I'm going to at least check it out for a

826.56 --> 832.04
bit because every time I bump into him

829.279 --> 835.24
in a movie then it kind of turns out to

832.04 --> 837.199
be never terrible it's like never really

835.24 --> 838.639
terrible thus far I don't know maybe

837.199 --> 841.7589999999999
there's some movies he played in that

838.639 --> 844.36
are just atrocious I haven't come across

841.759 --> 844.36
them just

850.199 --> 855.56
yet yeah the face makeup in loopers yeah

853.04 --> 855.56
that was

858.92 --> 861.92
weird

863.0 --> 870.68
right Loopers was a pretty weird

866.399 --> 870.68
movie but it was kind of interesting

884.16 --> 888.16
yeah hello lumpy gas in the vacuum good

885.839 --> 888.1600000000001
to see

897.68 --> 900.68
you

902.04 --> 906.4399999999999
but yeah basically project power is like

905.199 --> 910.0
oh drug

906.44 --> 912.7700000000001
dealing in some American city and it's

910.0 --> 915.279
trashy and

912.77 --> 918.279
[Music]

915.279 --> 922.079
it's a lot of bike Thief

918.279 --> 925.079
culture let's just say that very bike

922.079 --> 925.079
Thief culture

926.759 --> 932.48
oriented but like yeah they're basically

929.8 --> 935.88
like these drugs they're not like

932.48 --> 938.519
uniform so it's like oh every drug has

935.88 --> 944.16
like turns you into a

938.519 --> 944.16
super superhero powered person for a

945.04 --> 949.759
while and sometimes you blow

952.48 --> 957.6
up but I mean that stuff is just crazy

956.16 --> 960.6
it's just

957.6 --> 960.6
crazy

964.199 --> 969.7589999999999
but I mean the things that they managed

966.36 --> 972.9590000000001
to make up with that it was interesting

969.759 --> 972.9590000000001
but it was just super

979.6 --> 985.72
Overkill was it glorifying evil

982.8 --> 989.0
culture well it was just like oh yeah

985.72 --> 991.0400000000001
drug dealing oh yeah I have a tough it

989.0 --> 993.8
was

991.04 --> 996.16
just annoying and people were just

993.8 --> 998.8
[ __ ] criminals

996.16 --> 1002.68
and there was no light at the end of the

998.8 --> 1005.4799999999999
tunnel basically it wasn't like oh after

1002.68 --> 1009.4399999999999
that Adventure the drug dealer really

1005.48 --> 1011.8000000000001
figured out like wait I'm not doing that

1009.44 --> 1014.1600000000001
anymore right that that's not happening

1011.8 --> 1014.16
in this

1014.839 --> 1019.8000000000001
movie there's basically no solution

1017.519 --> 1022.0
cultural Sol there's No Redemption in

1019.8 --> 1022.0
that

1023.839 --> 1033.839
sense and that make it made it very bik

1028.0 --> 1033.839
th and the protagonist is black and it's

1033.919 --> 1040.2800000000002
like that

1036.959 --> 1043.72
actor Joseph Gordon levit was basically

1040.28 --> 1043.72
like the white guy in

1047.24 --> 1052.2
it and he does that more often and

1049.96 --> 1054.8400000000001
actually kind of

1052.2 --> 1057.32
works it just seems like such a freaking

1054.84 --> 1059.28
cool guy man it's

1057.32 --> 1061.96
[Music]

1059.28 --> 1065.12
yeah I hope he's not secretly like a

1061.96 --> 1065.1200000000001
super grabler on the

1066.44 --> 1072.0800000000002
inside but I mean you probably can't be

1069.44 --> 1075.679
because there's some sort of like energy

1072.08 --> 1077.24
meta data that you can't really

1075.679 --> 1080.2800000000002
fake

1077.24 --> 1082.2
it's yeah yeah because it shows it's

1080.28 --> 1084.32
like if an actor whatever they got on

1082.2 --> 1087.44
the inside when they act in that

1084.32 --> 1089.32
Spectrum it becomes all real and when

1087.44 --> 1092.1200000000001
they act in the opposite Spectrum then

1089.32 --> 1094.08
it kind of looks a bit fake it's like an

1092.12 --> 1095.6789999999999
yeah and that can change by the way what

1094.08 --> 1097.96
they have on the inside they can like

1095.679 --> 1099.96
have really dark phases and and really

1097.96 --> 1103.039
enlightened phases where they get out of

1099.96 --> 1105.8400000000001
it right but whatever is on the inside

1103.039 --> 1109.32
whenever an actor then acts in that

1105.84 --> 1111.84
frequency it becomes real so if an actor

1109.32 --> 1114.2
is like really good in a role of being a

1111.84 --> 1116.76
good guy there's a great chance that

1114.2 --> 1120.4
they are really naturally a good

1116.76 --> 1122.96
guy but actors that are like really like

1120.4 --> 1125.799
wow he's so good as an evil guy you got

1122.96 --> 1127.919
to be careful with that because those

1125.799 --> 1129.799
usually are have like a lot of Darkness

1127.919 --> 1132.64
on the

1129.799 --> 1134.32
inside they will still be nice but they

1132.64 --> 1137.0800000000002
have that

1134.32 --> 1139.76
inside well if like an actor has to like

1137.08 --> 1143.6789999999999
for some movie thingy or whatever soly

1139.76 --> 1145.919
play their evil twin

1143.679 --> 1149.039
then that's usually like there's

1145.919 --> 1151.4
something just really off about it when

1149.039 --> 1151.4
they do

1151.76 --> 1156.48
it unless they like always looked

1154.28 --> 1158.76
forward to trying that out but still

1156.48 --> 1161.76
it's all you yeah it's just

1158.76 --> 1161.76
different

1164.6 --> 1169.9599999999998
anyway it's very it can be very tough to

1167.52 --> 1172.559
like divine the nature of an

1169.96 --> 1174.2
actor but there are some markers you can

1172.559 --> 1176.6
look out

1174.2 --> 1179.039
for it's just kind of difficult to

1176.6 --> 1179.039
describe

1179.78 --> 1183.03
[Music]

1183.32 --> 1188.76
it glorifying it wasn't glorifying it

1186.52 --> 1192.84
lumpy gas in the vacuum it was just like

1188.76 --> 1195.2
emphasizing the thrill of like um like

1192.84 --> 1198.9189999999999
screw the system I'm

1195.2 --> 1200.799
just going to do business

1198.919 --> 1203.72
even if it's risky so it's like just

1200.799 --> 1206.6399999999999
this drug dealer culture

1203.72 --> 1209.52
thing it wasn't like glorifying it it

1206.64 --> 1212.5200000000002
wasn't like yeah they're super badass or

1209.52 --> 1213.679
it it did like there was a few moments

1212.52 --> 1217.0
where it's

1213.679 --> 1220.039
like like hey drug dealing bad it's just

1217.0 --> 1222.64
that the person never actually really

1220.039 --> 1222.64
got out of

1227.159 --> 1230.679
it

1229.08 --> 1234.12
I don't

1230.679 --> 1236.2800000000002
know so in

1234.12 --> 1238.8799999999999
general let's just say I think that

1236.28 --> 1242.6789999999999
akumu virus would probably appreciate

1238.88 --> 1245.919
that movie because he effectively has

1242.679 --> 1248.799
been through well probably not that

1245.919 --> 1252.2
violent things but he's been yeah he

1248.799 --> 1255.1589999999999
said that he's dealt drugs in the past

1252.2 --> 1257.1200000000001
so he would probably recognize a lot I

1255.159 --> 1259.919
wonder actually if

1257.12 --> 1262.039
it what akumu virus has to say maybe he

1259.919 --> 1263.6000000000001
has like some pointers from like yeah

1262.039 --> 1266.48
that thing that they always do that's

1263.6 --> 1268.76
complete hor [ __ ] this is how that those

1266.48 --> 1271.44
types of situations actually

1268.76 --> 1272.73
happen because there's probably plenty

1271.44 --> 1275.92
of

1272.73 --> 1275.92
[Music]

1275.96 --> 1280.76
that but if you're not like into the

1278.88 --> 1284.24
thrill of drug

1280.76 --> 1289.039
dealing then probably this movie is

1284.24 --> 1290.48
just meah to you maybe the special

1289.039 --> 1293.36
effects because they are pretty

1290.48 --> 1297.039
impressive I mean people literally like

1293.36 --> 1300.1589999999999
transform into monsters and

1297.039 --> 1301.96
[ __ ] like Elementals it's like one of

1300.159 --> 1304.0800000000002
the first things that happen like first

1301.96 --> 1308.1200000000001
pill somebody takes they literally turn

1304.08 --> 1308.12
into a fire Elemental like what the

1311.48 --> 1320.039
[ __ ] all kinds of things so for that

1315.88 --> 1320.0390000000002
it's like for the special effects pretty

1326.91 --> 1332.919
[Music]

1329.52 --> 1332.9189999999999
cool all right

1334.39 --> 1341.0
[Music]

1336.96 --> 1346.08
anyway hey Dr utar good to see

1341.0 --> 1349.96
you globers are trash people hello

1346.08 --> 1349.96
Adam 8 a.m. greeting

1359.98 --> 1363.17
[Music]

1374.2 --> 1380.039
I could say something that is

1376.72 --> 1383.559
arguably Maybe maybe a little

1380.039 --> 1386.8799999999999
racist but maybe like showing somebody

1383.559 --> 1389.6
that movie Project power is like an a

1386.88 --> 1389.6000000000001
bike Thief

1391.6 --> 1397.9599999999998
test like if you really think that's an

1394.88 --> 1397.96
awesome movie

1398.2 --> 1404.24
then you score pretty high on the bike

1401.2 --> 1407.2
Thief scale basically but if you like

1404.24 --> 1408.6
specifically dislike that movie and

1407.2 --> 1410.24
you're like I

1408.6 --> 1415.76
like I'm definitely not going to have my

1410.24 --> 1419.36
kid was that then you're like bike Thief

1415.76 --> 1419.36
free even if you're

1419.44 --> 1424.44
black I think this movie is a pretty

1421.72 --> 1424.44
good test for

1426.52 --> 1431.96
that and by the way you might think that

1429.64 --> 1436.2
sound silly me saying that but if you

1431.96 --> 1436.2
actually watch it think of

1436.88 --> 1441.8400000000001
that

1438.559 --> 1445.52
and let me know if you think I was right

1441.84 --> 1445.52
that it is like a bike Thief

1450.12 --> 1457.36
trap or not a trap a test it's like like

1455.36 --> 1459.279
I was just had a lot of trouble getting

1457.36 --> 1461.9189999999999
through this movie because it just was

1459.279 --> 1461.919
annoyed so

1462.96 --> 1467.3990000000001
much and like I just didn't like what

1465.36 --> 1469.08
they were doing like what people were

1467.399 --> 1471.4399999999998
doing just like

1469.08 --> 1476.48
demoralized

1471.44 --> 1476.48
victim victim feelings and

1481.399 --> 1489.4399999999998
like right like at least there wasn't

1485.12 --> 1492.399
just like super overt racism [ __ ]

1489.44 --> 1494.0
like all the yd being racist against

1492.399 --> 1497.08
Blackie or something there wasn't at

1494.0 --> 1498.799
least that wasn't there like if that

1497.08 --> 1501.0
would have been there I would have like

1498.799 --> 1503.8799999999999
now just been ranting and raving about

1501.0 --> 1506.6
how much it just sucks but at least they

1503.88 --> 1510.279
didn't do that it

1506.6 --> 1512.24
like racism was not actually a theme in

1510.279 --> 1515.24
the series or in the

1512.24 --> 1515.24
movie

1515.44 --> 1521.0800000000002
surprisingly but that at least it has

1518.36 --> 1521.08
that going for

1521.76 --> 1528.96
it but it's still just gangster like

1525.32 --> 1531.6789999999999
Street dealing gangster [ __ ] despite

1528.96 --> 1533.679
that but it's also just a lot of black

1531.679 --> 1538.44
on black

1533.679 --> 1540.8400000000001
violence and well in that sense I'm

1538.44 --> 1542.559
like well at least we're being a bit

1540.84 --> 1545.799
more realistic

1542.559 --> 1548.799
here like it did feel

1545.799 --> 1551.84
like the premise of the movie the movie

1548.799 --> 1554.84
Universe was at least trying to be

1551.84 --> 1557.72
honest and I appreciate

1554.84 --> 1559.279
that anyway maybe you you wouldn't get

1557.72 --> 1563.159
get all that out of it I don't know

1559.279 --> 1563.159
you'll have to watch it and then

1565.84 --> 1570.08
compare hard to for me to watch any kind

1568.2 --> 1573.3990000000001
of movie these

1570.08 --> 1577.24
days because I know too much from behind

1573.399 --> 1580.799
the scenes well a lot is just

1577.24 --> 1580.799
exaggerated though Supreme

1581.48 --> 1586.6
knowing doesn't mean it's not there it's

1584.039 --> 1589.6
just much more

1586.6 --> 1589.6
sparse

1600.72 --> 1611.32
[Music]

1607.2 --> 1611.32
okay I may believe what I

1613.64 --> 1619.039
want Yeah

1616.44 --> 1621.24
well yeah if I know if I have no

1619.039 --> 1624.24
evidence to assume the worst then why

1621.24 --> 1624.24
would I assume the

1627.44 --> 1633.3200000000002
worst when they tell you that is hard it

1630.12 --> 1633.32
is hard yeah of course I get

1638.24 --> 1641.96
it I mean for

1642.52 --> 1648.72
me even yeah yeah I just I have that too

1647.039 --> 1650.72
I mean

1648.72 --> 1653.44
I'm still going to watch things

1650.72 --> 1655.6000000000001
though but there is so much out there

1653.44 --> 1659.919
that is just horrendous to me and I I

1655.6 --> 1659.9189999999999
don't watch that and I never click

1660.48 --> 1667.08
it but I don't know there's just so much

1666.0 --> 1671.2
around

1667.08 --> 1674.039
now that there's always good stuff to

1671.2 --> 1674.039
find in between

1676.519 --> 1680.559
everything

1678.519 --> 1685.64
you've seen the sound of freed I haven't

1680.559 --> 1685.6399999999999
actually seen it no I don't feel like

1689.88 --> 1696.159
it I might like have a look somewhere

1692.72 --> 1699.039
later but I mean I I don't need to watch

1696.159 --> 1701.96
that I've already heard so many people

1699.039 --> 1701.96
blabber on about

1705.84 --> 1710.76
it I've seen all this stuff with like

1708.519 --> 1712.279
the actors and all like that's a [ __ ]

1710.76 --> 1715.279
weirdo

1712.279 --> 1719.6
dude that actor a

1715.279 --> 1719.6
freak and so is the maker

1721.96 --> 1726.96
basically like the military guy they use

1724.6 --> 1730.7199999999998
to basically get the details and all

1726.96 --> 1733.48
that from his that guy's actually like a

1730.72 --> 1736.3990000000001
psychopath

1733.48 --> 1741.1200000000001
but

1736.399 --> 1744.12
like not like a satanic psychopath

1741.12 --> 1746.1589999999999
maybe but he's just like somebody that's

1744.12 --> 1749.1999999999998
just like seen too much and then you

1746.159 --> 1751.0390000000002
just don't get your soul back really and

1749.2 --> 1753.2
just go with it because you're like yeah

1751.039 --> 1757.559
what are you going to do

1753.2 --> 1761.3600000000001
nothing but that guy is pretty [ __ ]

1757.559 --> 1762.8799999999999
up but I mean he has effectively done a

1761.36 --> 1765.6399999999999
lot of good

1762.88 --> 1769.3200000000002
too although yeah we don't all know

1765.64 --> 1769.3200000000002
everything he's done

1776.48 --> 1781.72
but yeah I mean Owen Benjamin covered

1779.919 --> 1783.6000000000001
sound of Freedom a

1781.72 --> 1786.2
lot the

1783.6 --> 1787.08
whole hype around it when that was

1786.2 --> 1790.919
coming

1787.08 --> 1792.519
out so in that sense indirectly I got I

1790.919 --> 1796.039
got

1792.519 --> 1800.32
to to know about it a

1796.039 --> 1802.279
lot like how it is the style and how it

1800.32 --> 1803.32
is manipulative like there's a lot of

1802.279 --> 1805.48
like

1803.32 --> 1807.9189999999999
manipulation trying to play on your

1805.48 --> 1810.48
emotions kind of thing going on which is

1807.919 --> 1814.039
like very typical also

1810.48 --> 1816.0
to the more modern Christian moov

1814.039 --> 1818.08
American Christian movie which is like

1816.0 --> 1821.72
sort

1818.08 --> 1824.24
of Hollywood not really not really

1821.72 --> 1824.24
Hollywood

1824.919 --> 1831.1200000000001
adjacent but they manipulate the [ __ ]

1827.679 --> 1834.0
out of their viewers always and I find

1831.12 --> 1836.2399999999998
that very very

1834.0 --> 1838.84
annoying cuz those types of movie like

1836.24 --> 1841.6
they don't really give you freedom to

1838.84 --> 1843.559
think they're just always imposing you

1841.6 --> 1845.519
like how you should think basically like

1843.559 --> 1849.72
that Christian dogma

1845.519 --> 1849.72
[ __ ] and I just can't stand

1855.519 --> 1861.96
that because of the s freom disguise

1858.679 --> 1864.24
themselves as okay that's a little far

1861.96 --> 1867.279
Supreme knowing but yeah I mean it's

1864.24 --> 1871.2
certainly something

1867.279 --> 1871.2
that that you could think

1872.679 --> 1878.44
of it's it's just important this is also

1875.399 --> 1880.5189999999998
what Owen Benjamin said like just not to

1878.44 --> 1883.2
see them like they are like the the

1880.519 --> 1883.2
Pinnacle of

1883.44 --> 1888.96
goodness that doesn't mean they are

1885.72 --> 1892.44
really evil it just means like they it's

1888.96 --> 1896.519
not as good as everybody hopes it is

1892.44 --> 1896.519
it's not some kind of Savior

1901.639 --> 1905.0
happening oh

1916.159 --> 1919.159
man

1938.279 --> 1942.36

but I'm assuming she probably didn't

2132.52 --> 2136.0
change a lot in the

2139.8 --> 2143.96
meantime Ready Set

2146.06 --> 2152.56
[Music]

2149.079 --> 2155.8
bicker yeah nice one five

2152.56 --> 2158.7999999999997
roads good to see

2155.8 --> 2158.8
you

2186.319 --> 2191.04
okay

2188.48 --> 2192.68
hey all right seems like Nathan is going

2191.04 --> 2196.24
to go

2192.68 --> 2200.72
live in half an hour so today is going

2196.24 --> 2200.72
to be a very short show as I thought it

2204.39 --> 2215.5299999999997
[Applause]

2206.96 --> 2215.53
[Music]

2215.68 --> 2218.68
would

2220.39 --> 2226.689
[Music]

2236.09 --> 2239.4390000000003
[Music]

2243.2 --> 2249.319
yes Supreme

2245.599 --> 2252.2000000000003
knowing but the point is is that I too

2249.319 --> 2255.72
know that about

2252.2 --> 2257.5989999999997
her it's just you just can't seem to let

2255.72 --> 2259.7599999999998
go of it it's like every time she's

2257.599 --> 2263.1600000000003
around you always feel the need to point

2259.76 --> 2263.1600000000003
that out to her and there's no

2265.839 --> 2270.7599999999998
point she just becomes very triggered

2268.52 --> 2275.24
when you do

2270.76 --> 2278.3590000000004
that like I stopped doing that years

2275.24 --> 2283.1189999999997
ago and I tried for quite a

2278.359 --> 2287.0
while it just does not accept

2283.119 --> 2289.839
it so it's actually on your part that

2287.0 --> 2292.56
you are holding on to

2289.839 --> 2294.68
that like you are engaging in a

2292.56 --> 2297.56
bickering relationship with her Supreme

2294.68 --> 2299.68
knowing like what happens sometimes with

2297.56 --> 2301.64
couples when they're in a relationship

2299.68 --> 2303.3999999999996
they get into this bickering thing you

2301.64 --> 2304.16
have that with her whether you like it

2303.4 --> 2307.1600000000003
or

2304.16 --> 2309.5989999999997
not and if you want to make it stop

2307.16 --> 2313.64
happening then you have to completely

2309.599 --> 2316.079
cut off your responses to that frequency

2313.64 --> 2318.7599999999998
that happens when you're in her vicinity

2316.079 --> 2321.2400000000002
and that's very

2318.76 --> 2323.119
tough I know you don't have to be

2321.24 --> 2326.1189999999997
talking to her that's the thing about a

2323.119 --> 2328.28
bickering relationship is that you just

2326.119 --> 2332.04
have to be near and if you're just doing

2328.28 --> 2332.0400000000004
something else they will get in your

2335.52 --> 2338.52
face

2338.68 --> 2342.52
right that's the that's the

2344.8 --> 2350.0
point and yes she does seem to have like

2347.839 --> 2353.839
wrench abuse issues and I even called

2350.0 --> 2357.119
her out on that years ago and oh man she

2353.839 --> 2360.48
was Gravely insulted when I did that so

2357.119 --> 2364.599
badly that she literally let like didn't

2360.48 --> 2366.92
come back for a long time and like Neil

2364.599 --> 2371.079
is still literally reminding me of

2366.92 --> 2375.599
having done that how evil I am for that

2371.079 --> 2379.599
okay there's no [ __ ] point whatsoever

2375.599 --> 2382.599
to correct any aspect of her

2379.599 --> 2385.7200000000003
behavior cuz she'll just declare war on

2382.599 --> 2385.7200000000003
you if you do

2386.16 --> 2392.5989999999997
that

2389.079 --> 2392.599
okay there's no

2395.4 --> 2398.4
point

2398.72 --> 2401.7999999999997
[Music]

2405.2 --> 2408.3399999999997
[Music]

2424.359 --> 2430.44
right and yeah she has that wrench and

2427.92 --> 2430.44
that's up to

2434.0 --> 2437.199
[Music]

2445.319 --> 2453.2
Nathan yeah and that is indeed very

2447.8 --> 2456.6400000000003
observative M AAL paa does turn any

2453.2 --> 2461.3999999999996
conversation into an argument about

2456.64 --> 2461.4
religion very good she always does that

2462.0 --> 2468.0
yeah because she feels like she has an

2465.079 --> 2468.0
authority in that

2470.64 --> 2476.839
area so she brings whatever is happening

2473.68 --> 2479.52
to her area of authority so that she can

2476.839 --> 2482.16
basically be socially

2479.52 --> 2484.72
worshiped through her self-imposed

2482.16 --> 2484.72
Priestly

2485.24 --> 2488.24
function

2499.599 --> 2505.2400000000002
right just like I how I typically like

2501.88 --> 2508.599
to bring a conversation toward esoteric

2505.24 --> 2511.4399999999996
descriptions except when I do that I

2508.599 --> 2513.1600000000003
don't actually impose Authority on

2511.44 --> 2515.92
somebody that I'm having a discussion

2513.16 --> 2520.839
with if there is a difference I will

2515.92 --> 2520.839
simply try to explain or or

2522.079 --> 2527.6400000000003
Bridge what is

2524.76 --> 2530.44
manifested that's the difference Paula

2527.64 --> 2533.44
does actually impose her Authority in

2530.44 --> 2533.44
those moments I

2535.28 --> 2543.0400000000004
don't I only impose my authority towards

2538.4 --> 2543.04
trolls that are just clearly there to

2545.16 --> 2548.16
disrupt

2552.72 --> 2556.0
right Emma yeah and it's

2556.04 --> 2561.92
ridiculous it it is like the evil

2559.92 --> 2564.2400000000002
priesthood that

2561.92 --> 2566.079
behavior I think that behavior is

2564.24 --> 2569.9199999999996
actually

2566.079 --> 2573.04
like those are Catholic

2569.92 --> 2577.52
demons those are Little Devils that are

2573.04 --> 2580.64
there created by the Catholic Church to

2577.52 --> 2584.119
manage people that think they're

2580.64 --> 2584.1189999999997
Christians that's how it

2594.599 --> 2600.92
feels it's like they've become addicted

2597.44 --> 2604.04
to the to the community power of

2600.92 --> 2608.079
Christianity to the Social Power that

2604.04 --> 2608.079
you can have within it

2609.0 --> 2612.839
if you claim it and others accept

2622.559 --> 2626.28
it wow M

2626.559 --> 2629.559
A

2632.72 --> 2640.0789999999997
yeah but I mean like uh

2636.92 --> 2642.8
Paula's chat on her live stream is just

2640.079 --> 2644.4
is not

2642.8 --> 2647.0
free

2644.4 --> 2650.2000000000003
like that's a chat where you fall in

2647.0 --> 2650.2
line or you get kicked

2651.64 --> 2657.1189999999997
out right and like fall in line

2665.0 --> 2668.0
completely

2680.119 --> 2684.359
if there is a hierarchy yeah

2687.48 --> 2693.8
exactly all right I well I apply a bit

2690.559 --> 2695.599
of hierarchy it's I I do try to

2693.8 --> 2697.8390000000004
establish a bit of social order on my

2695.599 --> 2700.599
own

2697.839 --> 2702.5589999999997
show right so in that sense there is a

2700.599 --> 2704.079
bit of a hierarchy but I'm not like

2702.559 --> 2708.0400000000004
imagining that

2704.079 --> 2710.2000000000003
that reaches beyond the actual event of

2708.04 --> 2710.2
the

2718.599 --> 2724.88
show people she's banned at flat SIDS

2722.24 --> 2727.8799999999997
really wow that's

2724.88 --> 2727.88
pathetic

2728.2 --> 2738.0789999999997
flat just lets her do that that's really

2733.24 --> 2738.0789999999997
pathetic but I mean yeah flat sord is is

2738.92 --> 2741.92
just

2754.88 --> 2757.88
dumb

2758.72 --> 2763.2799999999997
yeah once you surrender to that numpty

2761.72 --> 2765.64
Christianity

2763.28 --> 2770.48
format yeah that then you let other

2765.64 --> 2770.48
Fanatics just do what they

2772.04 --> 2778.24
want so he's decided I'm a Christian I'm

2775.24 --> 2781.8799999999997
going to let the Christian Flat earthers

2778.24 --> 2784.4799999999996
like push other people

2781.88 --> 2787.92
out cuz he doesn't want to

2784.48 --> 2790.0
agree with that he doesn't want to go

2787.92 --> 2792.64
into discussion

2790.0 --> 2794.119
or and hey there are some trolls out

2792.64 --> 2798.0
there with it too you know I hate

2794.119 --> 2798.0
atheist trolls that are just

2798.599 --> 2803.48
stupid but yeah they go further than

2800.92 --> 2807.92
that they also do it to just people that

2803.48 --> 2807.92
have been hanging around for for years

2808.76 --> 2814.88
potentially and that's where I

2811.319 --> 2817.52
definitely yeah that's where I like to

2814.88 --> 2821.6800000000003
an emergency signal to everybody else is

2817.52 --> 2824.48
like uh this is bad like this is bad for

2821.68 --> 2826.7599999999998
fed this is bad for Flat Earth that they

2824.48 --> 2826.76
do

2828.92 --> 2834.96
that also because they literally never

2832.359 --> 2837.359
ever apologize for doing it yeah when I

2834.96 --> 2840.44
go Angry on my show and I ban a couple

2837.359 --> 2843.2
of people because they were pissed off

2840.44 --> 2846.04
that I got pissed off all of a

2843.2 --> 2848.16
sudden well I will try to fix that

2846.04 --> 2850.2799999999997
afterward I will apologize when I feel

2848.16 --> 2852.64
like I went a little bit too far or

2850.28 --> 2855.1600000000003
something they don't do

2852.64 --> 2858.2799999999997
that when they go on their little

2855.16 --> 2860.7999999999997
Banning Crusades they never apologize

2858.28 --> 2864.52
for that they feel proud of doing that

2860.8 --> 2869.52
they think they've done something for

2864.52 --> 2869.52
Jesus they're idolizing

2869.92 --> 2876.44
God yeah so they are stuff yeah they are

2873.76 --> 2879.079
subjugating themselves to the

2876.44 --> 2882.319
delusion to the

2879.079 --> 2884.6400000000003
illogic Satan Satan breaking through

2882.319 --> 2888.599
that entire

2884.64 --> 2892.96
framework to just still be able to do

2888.599 --> 2892.96
whatever Satan likes to do through

2900.359 --> 2903.88
them heyo

2904.64 --> 2907.64
fruit

2934.599 --> 2937.599
for

2944.24 --> 2948.04
block button works on follow long yeah

2946.64 --> 2950.7599999999998
me

2948.04 --> 2954.079
too which is really absurd by the way

2950.76 --> 2956.1600000000003
that it actually had like she's the only

2954.079 --> 2959.7200000000003
person that I actually have to block

2956.16 --> 2962.8799999999997
that's a flat earther because it's

2959.72 --> 2965.359
just be I have to do it for my own

2962.88 --> 2967.04
protection because if I take notice of

2965.359 --> 2971.7599999999998
what she

2967.04 --> 2974.7599999999998
does and so any of it makes me feel the

2971.76 --> 2978.4
need to like address her about

2974.76 --> 2981.2400000000002
anything like it will start creating

2978.4 --> 2983.96
that again and then everybody will get

2981.24 --> 2985.359
angry at me I have to block her to

2983.96 --> 2988.319
protect

2985.359 --> 2990.119
myself yeah that's something you don't

2988.319 --> 2993.96
really say about a lot of people that

2990.119 --> 2993.96
are like in your side of the

2994.52 --> 2997.52
camp

3003.92 --> 3011.04
he'll hate you for calling you him out

3006.319 --> 3011.04
as a creep yeah he will not like that

3013.359 --> 3020.119
definitely but it's because he's just

3016.68 --> 3023.16
like his Christian faith is what allows

3020.119 --> 3027.28
him to do that because he thinks that

3023.16 --> 3030.44
being like that under the banner of his

3027.28 --> 3032.1600000000003
faith makes it Justified but that's not

3030.44 --> 3035.4
actually how that

3032.16 --> 3037.68
works in got God's

3035.4 --> 3040.799
eyes and even in accordance to the

3037.68 --> 3040.799
teachings of the Bible

3042.16 --> 3048.48
so he will not accept that you're

3044.96 --> 3048.48
calling him a creep for

3054.44 --> 3057.44
that

3058.12 --> 3062.85
[Music]

3064.68 --> 3070.2799999999997
she's a

3066.92 --> 3070.28
Nazi okay

3071.599 --> 3077.04
that's that's

3074.04 --> 3077.04
brutal

3077.2 --> 3085.799
but I yeah I don't

3081.04 --> 3088.2
know well you're an old lady so sorry to

3085.799 --> 3092.04
that you're really young though

3088.2 --> 3094.77
spirited but that kind of makes

3092.04 --> 3096.079
it it's like I

3094.77 --> 3099.68
[Music]

3096.079 --> 3101.28
guess you would know I I don't know it

3099.68 --> 3104.7599999999998
maybe it's a bit

3101.28 --> 3107.0
far I wouldn't call her a Nazi like even

3104.76 --> 3110.1600000000003
as a joke I just think she's like

3107.0 --> 3110.16
actually secretly a

3110.44 --> 3116.359
feminist I've said that about her before

3112.799 --> 3119.079
like she is an actual feminist

3116.359 --> 3123.0789999999997
like a feminist from the

3119.079 --> 3125.04
60s that were really serious back then

3123.079 --> 3127.48
and not like the modern feminists that

3125.04 --> 3129.48
are just disgusting and like over

3127.48 --> 3132.68
sexualizing and all that

3129.48 --> 3134.599
crap I think she's like an old feminist

3132.68 --> 3137.0789999999997
from the 60s and

3134.599 --> 3138.799
then she became a Christian but she

3137.079 --> 3141.119
never actually stopped being like a

3138.799 --> 3143.44
feminist and it continually comes true

3141.119 --> 3146.119
she's like every every opportunity she

3143.44 --> 3148.16
has in the Bible she will always try to

3146.119 --> 3152.44
emphasize how women were in it and they

3148.16 --> 3155.359
are just as important and oh for always

3152.44 --> 3159.7200000000003
always she has to do that it's so

3155.359 --> 3162.16
annoying because she's an unrep feminist

3159.72 --> 3165.5589999999997
she's just stuck in

3162.16 --> 3168.48
that so she's not a Christian that's a

3165.559 --> 3172.559
feminist she's a feminist that became a

3168.48 --> 3177.2400000000002
Christian to just put on another coat a

3172.559 --> 3177.2400000000002
coat of information that is Christianity

3178.77 --> 3183.119
[Applause]

3184.799 --> 3190.559
so I wouldn't call her a

3188.2 --> 3193.3999999999996
Nazi I'd rather call

3190.559 --> 3198.4
her

3193.4 --> 3200.96
uh freelance unwitting Marxist

3198.4 --> 3204.1600000000003
infiltrator which most people would

3200.96 --> 3207.0
describe as like an MK Ultra victim or

3204.16 --> 3209.1189999999997
something

3207.0 --> 3210.76
safe to say she knows not what she does

3209.119 --> 3214.119
I don't think she's like connected to

lot to do that you

must or you doom your [ __ ] Nation

3805.319 --> 3807.599
you

3808.76 --> 3817.4
must I know that's something you don't

3811.44 --> 3817.4
normally do but in this case you must do

3820.279 --> 3825.76
that don't do it alone get the other

3828.16 --> 3833.92
people like tell them where that goes

3831.16 --> 3835.319
yeah oh what you oh tests are acceptable

3833.92 --> 3837.119
well before you know it they're you're

3835.319 --> 3839.88
going to force [ __ ] masks on you and

3837.119 --> 3842.92
then before that then you think oh but I

3839.88 --> 3846.559
complied all of it and then suddenly you

3842.92 --> 3848.359
must take the VX or you lose the job

3846.559 --> 3850.7200000000003
yeah because that's what it [ __ ]

3848.359 --> 3853.48
leads to every [ __ ] time and that's

3850.72 --> 3856.9199999999996
why you need to get there right at the

3853.48 --> 3860.079
start to nip it in the butt before you

3856.92 --> 3861.92
get to that point where it's like Vex or

3860.079 --> 3864.559
lose your job and it's all too late

3861.92 --> 3868.559
anyway yeah that's why you need need to

3864.559 --> 3872.96
be there at the start to nip it in the

3868.559 --> 3876.7200000000003
bud figure out who is signing in the

3872.96 --> 3881.039
[ __ ] coid measures in your

3876.72 --> 3881.0389999999998
job and threaten with a

3884.119 --> 3887.44
strike do

3888.96 --> 3896.16
it or

3891.359 --> 3896.16
leave or leave the [ __ ] job

3898.039 --> 3903.599
and find a

3899.4 --> 3903.599
job where this [ __ ] doesn't

3907.799 --> 3917.0
happen cuz jobs that will have coid

3911.599 --> 3917.0
measures are not jobs that should

3921.079 --> 3930.6800000000003
exist basically any [ __ ] Corporation

3925.16 --> 3930.68
that must have [ __ ] Co measures is

3936.039 --> 3941.44
non-essential because if it's really

3938.559 --> 3944.48
essential guess what yeah if the crew

3941.44 --> 3946.4
says no we're not wearing masks no we're

3944.48 --> 3950.2
not taking the [ __ ] shot and no we

3946.4 --> 3952.64
are not taking your [ __ ] tests yeah

3950.2 --> 3956.7599999999998
guess what it's essential they're going

3952.64 --> 3958.5989999999997
to just get their way yeah that's what

3956.76 --> 3960.039
actually happens that's what has

3958.599 --> 3962.119
happened in

3960.039 --> 3966.6400000000003
2020 and

3962.119 --> 3972.52
21 people that had actual essential

3966.64 --> 3972.52
jobs and protested they just got their

3973.48 --> 3980.76
way so either you have an essential job

3977.2 --> 3982.0
you make a stand you you can be free of

3980.76 --> 3985.76
the stupid

3982.0 --> 3987.88
measures or you have to try to force

3985.76 --> 3990.4
person signing it in in your

3987.88 --> 3993.119
corporation through threat of a strike

3990.4 --> 3995.92
and lawsuit potentially because that

3993.119 --> 3997.799
will be possible now more than three

3995.92 --> 4002.279
years

3997.799 --> 4004.68
ago you do that or you leave and you

4002.279 --> 4008.279
find a better place where that won't

4004.68 --> 4013.0
happen or where before you get hired you

4008.279 --> 4016.2
can literally negotiate it into your

4013.0 --> 4020.839
contract that it's in black and white

4016.2 --> 4022.9199999999996
that if there's any medical Med medical

4020.839 --> 4026.24
things supposedly

4022.92 --> 4029.559
happening that you under no

4026.24 --> 4031.52
circumstances can be forced to wear a

4029.559 --> 4034.96
mask take a

4031.52 --> 4037.079
test or take a a

4034.96 --> 4041.2400000000002
medical

4037.079 --> 4045.1600000000003
injection you get it in writing in your

4041.24 --> 4047.64
contract when you get the job

4045.16 --> 4050.799
and you make sure you got a copy of that

4047.64 --> 4050.799
contract that you keep

4053.52 --> 4057.2
safe this is what you

4058.96 --> 4064.599
need and this like if I stop early bird

4062.4 --> 4067.1600000000003
showing and I go to find a j guess what

4064.599 --> 4070.2400000000002
I'll be doing this what I'll be doing

4067.16 --> 4072.96
when I get that new job yeah this

4070.24 --> 4074.68
exactly this I will have a special

4072.96 --> 4077.319
Clause you

4074.68 --> 4081.3999999999996
for the job

4077.319 --> 4082.839
contract that the employee employer has

4081.4 --> 4087.1600000000003
to

4082.839 --> 4090.16
sign before I take the job yeah that's

4087.16 --> 4093.92
what I'll be doing if I ever try to get

4090.16 --> 4095.1589999999997
a job outside of doing these YouTube

4093.92 --> 4099.04
streams

4095.159 --> 4101.64
here no Dr utar they don't

4099.04 --> 4102.839
anymore they don't you can't talk about

4101.64 --> 4106.96
it

4102.839 --> 4109.88
now that specific ban that that risk

4106.96 --> 4113.56
factor was lifted

4109.88 --> 4113.56
after after beginning

4113.759 --> 4121.0
20123 so that's why I have just decided

4117.56 --> 4124.4400000000005
to start just calling it co and and just

4121.0 --> 4126.4
save vaccination because they don't like

4124.44 --> 4129.2789999999995
kick everybody off for just using that

4126.4 --> 4131.4
anymore that policy has been stopped

4129.279 --> 4135.799000000001
they retracted it

4131.4 --> 4135.799
again right

4136.799 --> 4141.88
there's still things like if it's very

4139.279 --> 4143.52
in the moment you might still risk

4141.88 --> 4146.679
something you could still be flaged for

4143.52 --> 4148.52
medically misinformation if it's about

4146.679 --> 4151.4
something very specific if I start to

4148.52 --> 4155.400000000001
address like oh the current version and

4151.4 --> 4158.3189999999995
I start to talk about details about that

4155.4 --> 4160.239
specifically then I might risk right but

4158.319 --> 4162.1990000000005
I'm not doing that I'm talking about

4160.239 --> 4165.159
just the whole thing in general I don't

4162.199 --> 4170.12
have to get specific that way I I can be

4165.159 --> 4170.12
safe I can mention these

4178.64 --> 4184.799
things right and hey I'm just giving

4181.199 --> 4187.08
personal recommendations on how to deal

4184.799 --> 4187.08
with

4189.92 --> 4195.28
this yeah think about it next time yeah

4193.319 --> 4197.320000000001
when you get a

4195.28 --> 4199.84
job

4197.32 --> 4205.12
you have the

4199.84 --> 4208.04
right to add addition to the

4205.12 --> 4210.8
contract of your

4208.04 --> 4214.6
employment you can make your

4210.8 --> 4215.76
employer sign a contract that you will

4214.6 --> 4221.8
not be

4215.76 --> 4221.8
subjected to any mod medical related

4221.88 --> 4227.88
policy you can do that I mean they might

4225.8 --> 4231.12
reject you it's a

4227.88 --> 4235.1990000000005
possibility but you definitely have that

4231.12 --> 4239.84
right to at least attempt that and hey

4235.199 --> 4242.879999999999
if your job employer will just outright

4239.84 --> 4246.64
refuse then maybe you don't really want

4242.88 --> 4246.64
to be there anyway you

4247.0 --> 4255.56
know because they're probably going to

4249.159 --> 4258.199
be quite dictatorial then as an employer

4255.56 --> 4262.6
so and try the profit of you because

4258.199 --> 4264.759999999999
they do yeah they do profit of like

4262.6 --> 4267.360000000001
making you take faes and [ __ ] that's

4264.76 --> 4269.280000000001
been proven that they have done that the

4267.36 --> 4271.36
previous time and they will do try to do

4269.28 --> 4275.08
that here so if somebody's just like

4271.36 --> 4278.88
nope we're going with the co or whatever

4275.08 --> 4278.88
yeah you might not want to be there

4282.56 --> 4286.8
then

4284.88 --> 4290.36
to start arguing over the contract they

4286.8 --> 4294.2390000000005
just employed somebody else huge

4290.36 --> 4296.44
company well yeah I mean it's too late

4294.239 --> 4298.839999999999
to do that you're already in it and you

4296.44 --> 4302.199
obviously didn't do this this thing that

4298.84 --> 4304.8
I just described you can do

4302.199 --> 4306.759999999999
yeah but yeah there's this thing about

4304.8 --> 4309.28
big companies in general and that is

4306.76 --> 4309.280000000001
that they

4309.92 --> 4315.639
suck so why would you want to be with a

4313.6 --> 4319.76
huge company

4315.639 --> 4322.4400000000005
anyway they suck they suck you

4319.76 --> 4324.04
dry the bigger the company the more

4322.44 --> 4325.239
Reckless and careless they are with

4324.04 --> 4329.04
their own

4325.239 --> 4329.04
employees it's always

4335.56 --> 4341.159000000001
true they could for should have yeah but

4338.12 --> 4341.159
they can try

4341.679 --> 4345.4800000000005
it most of them yeah

4351.76 --> 4357.2390000000005
so yeah I mean hey M AAL you can just be

4355.44 --> 4358.839999999999
here every day and just completely

4357.239 --> 4361.239
ignore it and like no I have to get

4358.84 --> 4363.12
along I'm a robot I'm going to pretend

4361.239 --> 4364.48
like I'm not out of the ordinary I'm

4363.12 --> 4367.199
just going to take the test I know it's

4364.48 --> 4370.0
all [ __ ] but I'm going to do it just

4367.199 --> 4372.28
take a little bit of poison on a regular

4370.0 --> 4373.44
basis according to the procedures and

4372.28 --> 4375.08
then you're going to have some SI

4373.44 --> 4377.36
symptoms and then when you get those

4375.08 --> 4379.6
symptoms from the little bit of added

4377.36 --> 4381.5599999999995
poises on a regular basis oh look now

4379.6 --> 4384.04
they have an excuse to say oh you're

4381.56 --> 4384.8
classified as this in our thing that we

4384.04 --> 4388.5199999999995
made

4384.8 --> 4391.28
up or made up statistical chart of how

4388.52 --> 4393.92
to deal with it oh certain symptoms well

4391.28 --> 4396.48
because of the risk factor that we are

4393.92 --> 4398.32
at according to the stat right now that

4396.48 --> 4401.48
means you have

4398.32 --> 4404.32
this let's enroll you in that procedure

4401.48 --> 4407.199
yeah that's what they do with it

4404.32 --> 4411.0
that's what you get for going along with

4407.199 --> 4411.0
it just so you

4417.48 --> 4423.879999999999
know yeah I get it Emma yes I know eight

4421.32 --> 4425.759999999999
years that's very long time by the way

4423.88 --> 4427.8
but if you're there eight years then you

4425.76 --> 4430.4400000000005
also have like

4427.8 --> 4433.4800000000005
seniority within the company like you

4430.44 --> 4436.599999999999
probably know how things work there that

4433.48 --> 4439.638999999999
means you're more of an asset you can

4436.6 --> 4443.0
use that as we you can go there the

4439.639 --> 4445.32
sooner you do it the better like

4443.0 --> 4449.92
tomorrow if you can if you can do it

4445.32 --> 4452.759999999999
with it before the before the 15th that

4449.92 --> 4456.1990000000005
would be very smart and then literally

4452.76 --> 4459.12
say no I have seniority and I now I want

4456.199 --> 4461.12
this addendum to my contract or you're

4459.12 --> 4465.28
going to lose an

4461.12 --> 4465.28
asset i' try it

4466.36 --> 4470.839999999999
I mean do you also like train people in

4469.4 --> 4474.679
your

4470.84 --> 4477.92
company because good trainers is

4474.679 --> 4482.08
extremely valuable to large

4477.92 --> 4484.8
corporations yeah if a good trainer is

4482.08 --> 4487.08
out of the picture that literally slows

4484.8 --> 4490.639
down the whole

4487.08 --> 4493.04
thing they don't tell you that but it is

4490.639 --> 4493.84
true and eventually you'll figure that

4493.04 --> 4498.28
out

4493.84 --> 4498.28
if you stay long enough like two

4502.96 --> 4506.84
decades okay well that's good Emma field

4505.239 --> 4510.239
that at least they're not they don't

4506.84 --> 4512.88
care about facts that is good but still

4510.239 --> 4516.678999999999
the test is not good for you it is not

4512.88 --> 4519.84
good for you trust me don't take

4516.679 --> 4523.32
them you have to push the line you have

4519.84 --> 4526.8
to get it to zero you have to make them

4523.32 --> 4529.5199999999995
go to Z we have to try it can't just say

4526.8 --> 4533.159000000001
oh well at least they done to the vax

4529.52 --> 4536.360000000001
but all the rest they do make sure they

4533.159 --> 4539.5199999999995
don't what's going on

4536.36 --> 4539.5199999999995
here uh

4541.719 --> 4547.719

4664.36 --> 4671.199
that so just keep the support

4668.52 --> 4673.0
coming right so you don't believe in the

4671.199 --> 4674.12
flu I oh yeah sure there's there's the

4673.0 --> 4677.52
the

4674.12 --> 4680.28
flu it's a disease it's your body

4677.52 --> 4683.2390000000005
cleaning itself up it's a cleaning up

4680.28 --> 4686.599999999999
process yeah and there might be some

4683.239 --> 4689.239
bacteria that make an appearance during

4686.6 --> 4691.719
that phase of your body when it's doing

4689.239 --> 4695.36
that yeah those bacteria however don't

4691.719 --> 4699.12
actually cause the disease C postulate

4695.36 --> 4702.32
has never been applied to actually

4699.12 --> 4704.719
test yeah it's just assumed it's just

4702.32 --> 4707.5199999999995
presupposed

4704.719 --> 4710.12
like the entirety of virology is based

4707.52 --> 4712.719
on one giant

4710.12 --> 4715.84
presupposition it's all presupposed it's

4712.719 --> 4718.2390000000005
statistical workings based on all on

4715.84 --> 4720.08
presupposition that cost postulate has

4718.239 --> 4722.959999999999
been applied and that it always does

4720.08 --> 4724.239
apply that's how it works that's how

4722.96 --> 4728.36
virology

4724.239 --> 4730.879999999999
works it's all presupposed all of it

4728.36 --> 4734.12
cost postulate never was

4730.88 --> 4735.639
applied right anyway

4734.12 --> 4737.12
I'll be back tomorrow with flat Earth
