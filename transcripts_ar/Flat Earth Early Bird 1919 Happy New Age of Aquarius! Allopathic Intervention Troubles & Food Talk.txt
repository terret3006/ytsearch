188.159 --> 194.79899999999998
precipitation we'll see if that

191.76 --> 196.04
happens but yeah yesterday here was a

194.799 --> 199.76000000000002
pretty heavy

196.04 --> 203.28
storm like lightning storm came

199.76 --> 207.0
over so like was so much of it I thought

203.28 --> 209.28
like oh [ __ ] it's going to hit us but it

207.0 --> 211.76
didn't there was just a lot of flashes

209.28 --> 211.76
going on

213.72 --> 218.35999999999999
maybe it was some kind of weird upper

216.12 --> 221.28
lightning like lightning that didn't

218.36 --> 224.48000000000002
really hit down I barely heard thunder

221.28 --> 226.239
from it but there was just like a lot of

224.48 --> 232.23899999999998
lightning going

226.239 --> 232.239
on hey hello debatable D first in

232.28 --> 237.519

250.439 --> 253.439
eclipse

254.159 --> 259.519
oh happy age of Happy New Age of

268.72 --> 271.72
Aquarius

276.08 --> 281.44
yeah hello Gary F let see

283.12 --> 288.24
you all right as I

285.88 --> 291.639
predicted the overall Eclipse event

288.24 --> 291.639
would be very

294.68 --> 300.479
uneventful and like peaceful and calm

297.6 --> 301.84000000000003
and just everybody

300.479 --> 305.59999999999997
enjoying their

301.84 --> 310.15999999999997
days checking out the

305.6 --> 310.16
eclipse LSG made a couple of

316.0 --> 321.36
videos that was kind of interesting if

318.199 --> 321.36
he shows up I'll show

323.759 --> 328.639
it

325.52 --> 331.639
right and for the rest of my

328.639 --> 331.639
day

331.88 --> 336.8
I watched the second Dune

334.08 --> 340.24
movie and yeah that

336.8 --> 344.56
was well I was just very much a followup

340.24 --> 349.36
of the the previous one the first dude

344.56 --> 349.36
movie and yeah it was pretty

349.68 --> 358.479
good like so much more detail than the

354.759 --> 358.47900000000004
original 84

358.639 --> 361.639
movie

362.84 --> 366.71999999999997
well balanced I I did like

374.88 --> 380.759
it and seems like with the second Doom

377.8 --> 383.039
movie it is like the original 84 movie

380.759 --> 383.039
is

385.16 --> 391.56
covered hello Cleary good to see

388.56 --> 391.56
you

393.039 --> 397.759
looks like the the trolls have

395.96 --> 399.96
awakened

397.759 --> 404.68
today oh

399.96 --> 404.68
well not that it's going to bother me

418.52 --> 421.52
but

422.0 --> 427.879
right also mine unveiled

425.199 --> 430.84000000000003
Unleashed their latest video the third

427.879 --> 434.16
in the series The China Andi

430.84 --> 434.15999999999997
series very

438.319 --> 445.52000000000004
interesting about the crystal

442.0 --> 448.039
Castle that was probably there in

445.52 --> 448.039
America

448.52 --> 453.68
originally

450.039 --> 456.479
and like how the whole thing seems to be

453.68 --> 456.479
hijacked by

458.08 --> 463.28
Freemasonry like it doesn't really say

461.0 --> 464.68
it overtly but like gives me this

463.28 --> 467.28
feeling

464.68 --> 469.28000000000003
like there was a lot there it was

467.28 --> 472.28
removed and there's just a couple of

469.28 --> 472.28
monuments that

472.479 --> 477.479
basically hint at what used to be

478.44 --> 481.44
there

481.49 --> 484.689
[Music]

485.199 --> 489.639
but isn't anymore because they removed

487.28 --> 491.79999999999995
it and it's not officially supposed to

489.639 --> 495.96000000000004
be there

491.8 --> 495.96000000000004
anymore but they still hint at

497.319 --> 502.03900000000004
it which is kind of tragic in a

502.759 --> 508.44
way but yeah definitely worth watching

505.96 --> 510.02
that video as

508.44 --> 513.19
well

510.02 --> 513.1899999999999
[Music]

519.88 --> 524.57
hello man

521.34 --> 524.57
[Music]

538.44 --> 546.36
goost right so today is going to be

542.16 --> 546.36
pretty laidback day for me at

568.36 --> 571.36
least

578.64 --> 584.0
all right now I'm just looking around at

581.44 --> 584.0
what's going

592.12 --> 596.68
on was also looking around on Twitter

595.079 --> 600.04
and

596.68 --> 601.519
apparently there were some UFOs cided

600.04 --> 604.8389999999999
during the

601.519 --> 607.76
Eclipse which is like kind of

604.839 --> 612.6400000000001
weird nothing super spectacular but

607.76 --> 615.399
still like just kind of odd but yeah no

612.64 --> 615.399
earthquakes

616.64 --> 626.12
nothing no no Bridge

620.279 --> 626.12
accidents just really uneventful

628.32 --> 632.839
overall

630.44 --> 635.0
uh I did also like have a really nice

632.839 --> 637.1600000000001
view in the

635.0 --> 642.279
evening after my

637.16 --> 644.8
show uh had a really good view on the

642.279 --> 646.8389999999999
Sundown when it was the sun was close at

644.8 --> 649.16
the Horizon it just stood out to me like

646.839 --> 652.8800000000001
how incredibly big it

649.16 --> 655.279
looked like it was really really wide

652.88 --> 655.279
big

655.44 --> 661.36
sun and I was able to like look at it

658.12 --> 664.92
directly without like getting blinded at

661.36 --> 667.72
all so I did a bit of sungazing with

664.92 --> 669.959
that pretty much right around where the

667.72 --> 672.519
when the eclipse was happening over in

669.959 --> 672.5189999999999
the United

688.24 --> 691.24
States

697.87 --> 701.12
[Music]

709.9 --> 713.22
[Music]

718.56 --> 722.8
I also bumped pumped into a hilarious

720.36 --> 722.8000000000001
Twitter

725.519 --> 728.92
post from

728.959 --> 732.56
like let's see if I can find it back it

731.32 --> 735.72
was really

732.56 --> 738.92
funny like somebody edited a

735.72 --> 742.48
photo of like Greta getting hauled by

738.92 --> 745.76
the police officers oh yeah here it

742.48 --> 750.0790000000001
is and somebody just like photoshopped

745.76 --> 752.36
like really huge boobs on Earth which is

750.079 --> 752.3599999999999
very

762.12 --> 767.12
funny I just thought that was

765.0 --> 769.959
hilarious I'm not going to show it it's

767.12 --> 772.279
just childish but I mean it is really

769.959 --> 774.279
funny and yeah I

772.279 --> 776.88
mean people

774.279 --> 779.6
really need to stop thinking that she's

776.88 --> 782.8
flat or anything CU that's nonsense any

779.6 --> 785.76
way but like yeah the exaggerated troll

782.8 --> 789.079
photo that was really funny

785.76 --> 792.0
though all right but yeah out there

789.079 --> 792.0
nothing is really

792.839 --> 798.639
happening nothing out of the ordinary

795.959 --> 798.6389999999999
business as

806.19 --> 811.12
[Music]

808.12 --> 811.12
usual

811.7 --> 814.869
[Music]

838.04 --> 841.04
yeah

846.92 --> 851.759
right but yeah it's still April so yeah

849.639 --> 854.8
the weather's going to do whatever it

851.759 --> 854.8000000000001
likes as they

854.959 --> 862.1199999999999
say hey fber outs good to see

858.639 --> 864.519
you oh who survived the

862.12 --> 867.16
eclipse I think pretty much everybody

864.519 --> 867.16
survived the

868.04 --> 871.04
eclipse

898.04 --> 901.04
e

903.519 --> 907.399
I was checking out

909.48 --> 915.279
uh take back space TV

912.92 --> 916.8389999999999
channel who usually has some really

915.279 --> 920.36
great Celestial

916.839 --> 922.44
footage and he filmed the eclipse too

920.36 --> 925.36
even caught a bunch of

922.44 --> 928.36
sunspots like during the

925.36 --> 931.36
eclipse sunspots on the sun being

928.36 --> 931.36
visible that was kind of

939.31 --> 942.4
[Music]

946.519 --> 952.519
interesting

949.44 --> 957.44
yeah I'm a bit sniffy

952.519 --> 957.44
though it might be like just the

957.92 --> 960.92
wind

967.48 --> 971.1990000000001
why did the trees distort like

971.36 --> 976.44
that well it's

974.12 --> 979.12
because the non-local holographic

976.44 --> 983.6
angular manifestation of the Sun the

979.12 --> 983.6
light was all Eclipse

985.279 --> 990.92
shaped like that that just happens

995.56 --> 999.1199999999999
if you have some kind of light source

997.199 --> 1001.0
and there's something yeah you can even

999.12 --> 1002.72
emulate this with physical light if you

1001.0 --> 1005.48
have light source and you have something

1002.72 --> 1009.6800000000001
in front of it then the Shadows it's

1005.48 --> 1012.88
going to cast are going to

1009.68 --> 1015.04
be of the same shape like every

1012.88 --> 1018.04
consecutive piece of Shadow is going to

1015.04 --> 1020.4399999999999
have like the same type of obstruction

1018.04 --> 1024.1599999999999
of the light

1020.44 --> 1026.959
that it's going to show that that just

1024.16 --> 1029.199
happens it is very trippy I know it's

1026.959 --> 1029.199
kind of

1029.48 --> 1036.48
weird but that is natural

1032.839 --> 1036.48
though I've seen it

1042.28 --> 1046.9189999999999
before it becomes really pronounced when

1044.839 --> 1049.1599999999999
there's like no clouding and what and

1046.919 --> 1053.3600000000001
all that it's really clear when the

1049.16 --> 1053.3600000000001
eclipse happens then you really see it a

1057.96 --> 1062.08
lot like the image is

1064.16 --> 1069.44
alive yeah well if you have like

1066.679 --> 1071.8400000000001
continual Shadow casting like during the

1069.44 --> 1074.96
entire Eclipse then you can literally

1071.84 --> 1077.84
see the eclipse basically

1074.96 --> 1080.48
shifting in the

1077.84 --> 1083.84
shadow

1080.48 --> 1087.799
like in every part of the

1083.84 --> 1090.0
Shadow it is kind of odd as a spectacle

1087.799 --> 1092.84
but I mean it's all logical within

1090.0 --> 1092.84
within the range of

1107.4 --> 1112.3600000000001
Optics you never knew that okay well now

1110.2 --> 1112.3600000000001
you

1113.11 --> 1117.1399999999999
[Music]

1119.99 --> 1126.599
[Music]

1137.72 --> 1140.72
know

1143.039 --> 1150.28
W just look at

1146.72 --> 1150.28
this Blossom

1155.2 --> 1159.6000000000001
storm blossoms getting all blown

1167.72 --> 1170.72
upward

1175.159 --> 1178.919
yeah the wind is blowing pretty hard out

1192.44 --> 1199.559
there

1195.4 --> 1201.96
right man I feel like I'm I want some

1199.559 --> 1204.6
coffee I'm going to turn on my coffee

1201.96 --> 1207.32
and put Illuminati kasan in the oven

1204.6 --> 1207.32
I'll be right

1227.64 --> 1230.64
back

1257.6 --> 1260.6
e

1317.52 --> 1320.52
right

1359.0 --> 1366.2
right so yeah I'm U pretty much set and

1363.159 --> 1370.0800000000002
blank slate don't really have any

1366.2 --> 1372.88
particular subject I wanted to address

1370.08 --> 1377.12
it's just kind of the day

1372.88 --> 1380.44
after I mean I did watch Dune part two

1377.12 --> 1380.4399999999998
which was pretty cool

1380.799 --> 1385.6399999999999
but I mean it it's just like the

1382.919 --> 1388.0800000000002
continuation of the first movie like you

1385.64 --> 1390.159
could basically added the two together

1388.08 --> 1393.72
and it would be like one

1390.159 --> 1396.72
movie pretty much very long movie by the

1393.72 --> 1396.72
way it would

1397.96 --> 1402.4
be it's kind of large of the Ring

1403.919 --> 1410.3600000000001
sized I wonder if they'll add a third

1406.919 --> 1411.64
part though technically that would then

1410.36 --> 1415.279
reach

1411.64 --> 1418.5200000000002
beyond the original

1415.279 --> 1422.84
movie and there is more

1418.52 --> 1422.84
stuff I just wonder if they'll go

1427.48 --> 1430.48
there

1435.279 --> 1442.799
uh I also already addressed the China

1438.48 --> 1444.64
unveil part three movie

1442.799 --> 1446.799
which

1444.64 --> 1449.279
video from M

1446.799 --> 1451.76
unveiled definitely worth checking out I

1449.279 --> 1455.96
mean

1451.76 --> 1455.96
but you just have to watch

1459.66 --> 1466.64
[Music]

1462.08 --> 1466.6399999999999
it the original books are a

1467.36 --> 1470.36
trilogy

1471.32 --> 1477.6399999999999
yeah but I mean they pretty much the

1474.919 --> 1480.7990000000002
first and the second movie now the

1477.64 --> 1484.0
latest ones are all pretty much the

1480.799 --> 1484.0
first book

1489.84 --> 1493.0
though I

1494.2 --> 1499.64
think although maybe the

1496.919 --> 1501.88
trilogy uh maybe I'm getting it wrong I

1499.64 --> 1501.88
don't

1520.64 --> 1526.0800000000002
know right but I mean with the quality

1524.32 --> 1528.36
of the

1526.08 --> 1530.4399999999998
movie I'm sure there's a lot of people

1528.36 --> 1533.9189999999999
people that are going to be like yeah

1530.44 --> 1537.159
show us more of that I mean go all the

1533.919 --> 1540.679
way go all the way to the end with it

1537.159 --> 1540.679
with this quality that's

1540.88 --> 1545.88
great like the Australian miniseries

1543.96 --> 1548.3990000000001
that nobody's ever heard

1545.88 --> 1553.44
of like already

1548.399 --> 1557.12
went to the end pretty much so

1553.44 --> 1557.1200000000001
like they could do

1557.24 --> 1560.24
that

1572.159 --> 1577.7600000000002
but man I have to say like especially in

1574.84 --> 1580.799
this part two like you get to see a lot

1577.76 --> 1583.64
of like interaction with the worm worm

1580.799 --> 1586.24
riding and all that and they really made

1583.64 --> 1586.24
it so

1586.32 --> 1592.1589999999999
spectacular like if you watch like the

1588.679 --> 1594.72
84 movie like that now just looks really

1592.159 --> 1597.7990000000002
silly in comparison I mean the shots

1594.72 --> 1600.3600000000001
where he's like riding the worm it's it

1597.799 --> 1603.6399999999999
was makeshift it was it was good enough

1600.36 --> 1607.08
but dude with in this movie it just

1603.64 --> 1607.0800000000002
looks really

1610.84 --> 1620.0
spectacular how were I able to watch it

1614.24 --> 1624.1200000000001
so early I downloaded some web rip

1620.0 --> 1627.12
so probably somebody had a like a a web

1624.12 --> 1629.7199999999998
exclusive type of

1627.12 --> 1632.52
access and then rip

1629.72 --> 1635.559
that it wasn't it was a good quality not

1632.52 --> 1638.0
not a cam there's cams out there too but

1635.559 --> 1641.36
they're terrible only one issue I had

1638.0 --> 1644.84
with this download is that the sound was

1641.36 --> 1644.84
kind of

1647.159 --> 1650.159
low

1652.32 --> 1655.8799999999999
but I mean it it did the

1655.96 --> 1659.099
[Music]

1677.12 --> 1680.12
job

1681.96 --> 1689.279

1783.679 --> 1790.1200000000001
looking Twitter again apparently

1786.039 --> 1790.12
zilinsky is begging for money

1790.88 --> 1796.679
again with the claim oh if you don't if

1794.519 --> 1800.919
you don't support me other countries

1796.679 --> 1800.919
will get attacked oh really will they

1803.12 --> 1806.12
now

1807.32 --> 1814.4399999999998
why I don't think so I don't know I

1810.88 --> 1814.44
shouldn't be addressing it it's

1826.96 --> 1829.96
ridiculous

1894.88 --> 1901.96
know it's so ridiculous out there it

1898.799 --> 1906.1589999999999
makes me feel stupid even for addressing

1901.96 --> 1906.159

2048.879 --> 2053.0
warning right I'm going to get my

2050.679 --> 2055.2400000000002

2156.64 --> 2161.5989999999997
I on the way really Greg

2165.839 --> 2172.16
runel seriously you settle for gas

2169.599 --> 2172.1600000000003
station

2172.64 --> 2177.0789999999997
food I told you you should bring your

2180.68 --> 2185.9199999999996
own six hour drive

2183.64 --> 2188.56
okay yeah but that doesn't mean that you

2185.92 --> 2192.2400000000002
can make your own you can't make your

2188.56 --> 2194.88
own snacks and drinks before you go on a

2192.24 --> 2194.8799999999997
6-hour

2198.839 --> 2205.319
drive that's a long way to travel by the

2201.56 --> 2205.319
way where the hell did you come

2214.72 --> 2222.48
from although it's in the United States

2217.599 --> 2225.119
so I mean any distance is like a 6-hour

2222.48 --> 2228.72
drive the gas station was essentially a

2225.119 --> 2228.7200000000003
grocery store okay fair

2237.2 --> 2244.04
enough I haven't tried any spells since

2240.24 --> 2249.52
the eclipse so that's your [ __ ]

2244.04 --> 2249.52
problem I did and it worked great

2276.44 --> 2279.44
h

2280.16 --> 2285.359
right but let me be clear

2282.88 --> 2287.96
that like my

2285.359 --> 2292.2
prediction nothing happened nothing out

2287.96 --> 2292.2
of the ordinary happened nothing scary

2292.56 --> 2301.2
happened no terrorist attack no accident

2298.0 --> 2306.119
like catastrophic

2301.2 --> 2309.68
accident no weird sickness breaking

2306.119 --> 2312.6400000000003
out it was all nice and

2309.68 --> 2316.1189999999997
relaxed and maybe even a bit boring and

2312.64 --> 2318.2799999999997
eventful wasn't it exactly like I said

2316.119 --> 2318.28
it

2322.64 --> 2329.2
would right I mean shit's still going to

2325.2 --> 2332.839
happen I'm sure but not while that's

2329.2 --> 2335.3999999999996
happening before it after

2332.839 --> 2339.44
it sure I mean there's all kinds of

2335.4 --> 2339.44
things going to happen this year

2345.76 --> 2350.7200000000003
it's less than 24 hours ago yeah I

2353.68 --> 2360.52
know I mean did something just happen

2357.52 --> 2363.52
did something just happen

2360.52 --> 2363.52
no

2366.359 --> 2371.119
nothing

2368.68 --> 2373.7599999999998
but you all got the opportunity to

2371.119 --> 2376.2400000000002
basically let go of

2373.76 --> 2380.4
fear and project

2376.24 --> 2380.3999999999996
your best wishes and good

2381.599 --> 2389.2000000000003
hopes onto the new

2384.8 --> 2389.2000000000003
age something that I did very

2396.319 --> 2399.319
actively

2403.85 --> 2407.83
[Music]

2413.839 --> 2417.359
and I had more chocolate ice

2417.72 --> 2424.5989999999997
cream but I'm not going to do that again

2420.079 --> 2424.599
for a while it was very nice

2426.319 --> 2429.319
though

2456.24 --> 2462.1989999999996
for

2457.29 --> 2462.199
[Music]

2465.8 --> 2471.28
[Music]

2467.76 --> 2475.079

2471.28 --> 2477.6400000000003
good you feel good in peaceful are you

2475.079 --> 2479.92
already getting pulled at by the

2477.64 --> 2482.72
darkness it's all too boring things need

2479.92 --> 2485.4
to go wrong and you need to see yelling

2482.72 --> 2485.3999999999996
people in

2486.24 --> 2494.0
conflict to saturate the hole in your

2491.319 --> 2497.599
soul cuz I'm just really chill and

2494.0 --> 2497.599
relaxed I'm like

2501.92 --> 2507.92
yeah why not just

2505.04 --> 2510.96
relax I mean the wind is not exactly

2507.92 --> 2513.48
helping though wind is kind of

2510.96 --> 2515.96
annoying that that does tend to make

2513.48 --> 2515.96
things more

2516.24 --> 2519.24
Restless

2528.8 --> 2533.48
but I mean it's April so yeah what do

2531.24 --> 2533.4799999999996
you

2539.01 --> 2542.1290000000004
[Music]

2546.119 --> 2549.119
expect

2569.13 --> 2575.579
[Music]

2576.119 --> 2579.119
for

2581.05 --> 2585.53

2591.09 --> 2600.4790000000003
[Music]

2606.119 --> 2609.119

2616.599 --> 2624.4
right so yeah whenever you're ready

2620.119 --> 2624.4
whatever you want to talk about Bring It

2636.04 --> 2639.04
On

2666.04 --> 2669.04
for

2672.09 --> 2675.3
[Music]

2686.24 --> 2690.0
I'm just kind of looking around to see

2688.16 --> 2693.7999999999997
if

2690.0 --> 2693.8
anything interesting is

2694.2 --> 2700.04
happening it just seems like more of the

2697.079 --> 2704.6400000000003
same typical stuff nothing acute

2700.04 --> 2704.64
nothing spectacular as I said it

2725.96 --> 2728.96
would

2746.119 --> 2749.119
hm

2755.92 --> 2758.92
h

2770.72 --> 2776.839
oh there's some mention

2773.0 --> 2781.4
here monoclonal

2776.839 --> 2781.4
antibodies to be used against

2781.88 --> 2786.92
cancer which apparently works really

2784.2 --> 2788.24
well I mean at this point like what

2786.92 --> 2791.64
freaking

2788.24 --> 2791.64
research what kind

2792.16 --> 2798.96
of low intervention type of cure doesn't

2796.559 --> 2802.2400000000002
cure cancer at this

2798.96 --> 2804.68
point I mean

2802.24 --> 2806.8799999999997
seriously every time I see it it's like

2804.68 --> 2810.24
oh wow this thing all this works really

2806.88 --> 2815.04
well oh it's being hidden and I'm like

2810.24 --> 2817.7999999999997
what like the other 20 different methods

2815.04 --> 2819.5589999999997
of getting rid of cancer guar

2817.8 --> 2821.079
that works really well without any

2819.559 --> 2822.599
remission

2821.079 --> 2825.599
ever

2822.599 --> 2825.599
like

2825.92 --> 2833.839
this I mean that there's no cure to

2829.559 --> 2837.0
cancer is like a gigantic medical

2833.839 --> 2840.24
myth let's just say it like

2837.0 --> 2841.52
that finding the cure to cancer is

2840.24 --> 2844.04
absolute

2841.52 --> 2848.839
nonsense there are so many different

2844.04 --> 2848.839
ways to treat all kinds of cancer

2851.359 --> 2857.7999999999997
that actually work that aren't being

2854.04 --> 2860.24
recognized that to find the cure for it

2857.8 --> 2862.3590000000004
is kind of ridiculous because there are

2860.24 --> 2864.7999999999997
so many of them you can't even keep

2862.359 --> 2864.7999999999997
track of

2867.24 --> 2873.0
it yeah and all these ways that are not

2870.24 --> 2877.68
being officially admitted not being

2873.0 --> 2882.16
standardized are all way better and way

2877.68 --> 2882.16
cheaper than any mainstream

2882.2 --> 2887.319
procedure that is actually really bad

2884.64 --> 2889.359
for your body the mainstream procedures

2887.319 --> 2893.52
all of them all three things you

2889.359 --> 2896.5589999999997
typically do are all terrible surgical

2893.52 --> 2902.28
intervention terrible chemical

2896.559 --> 2905.0
intervention horrendous literally Soul

2902.28 --> 2909.92
destroying often in a unique way which

2905.0 --> 2914.04
is hor horrible and of course radiation

2909.92 --> 2914.04
is yeah it's not good

2917.88 --> 2923.2000000000003
either but it's to me it's almost like

2920.48 --> 2925.76
laughable at this point it isn't really

2923.2 --> 2929.8799999999997
laugh it's just so ridiculous that oh

2925.76 --> 2932.5200000000004
look we found this oh we found a new way

2929.88 --> 2935.7200000000003
oh the new treatment and like what

2932.52 --> 2938.72
another one for the

2935.72 --> 2938.72
list

2941.599 --> 2946.839
I mean the conclusion I'm drawing is

2943.599 --> 2948.839
pretty much you can just try anything

2946.839 --> 2950.839
anything except for the mainstream

2948.839 --> 2953.839
procedures and how to respond to cancer

2950.839 --> 2955.799
and you'll be fine like you can pretty

2953.839 --> 2958.64
much do anything

2955.799 --> 2962.72
else and it'll be

2958.64 --> 2965.319
fine like without remission without it

2962.72 --> 2968.2799999999997
coming back if you do the mainstream

2965.319 --> 2970.72
procedures the the the chances it'll

2968.28 --> 2973.1600000000003
come back and if it does even more

2970.72 --> 2976.359
aggressive than ever are very

2973.16 --> 2978.799
significant compared to any other

2976.359 --> 2982.799
alternative form of treatment like one

2978.799 --> 2984.04
out of the 20 plus which don't have

2982.799 --> 2989.319
aggressive

2984.04 --> 2992.319
remissions none of them I mean

2989.319 --> 2992.319
hello

2995.64 --> 2998.64
hello

3002.4 --> 3006.4
anyway that just came popping

3014.28 --> 3022.079
up I'd love to talk about this with like

3018.599 --> 3024.3590000000004
an actual medical professional that

3022.079 --> 3025.92
allows thems to talk about this kind of

3024.359 --> 3027.5589999999997
subject I'd love to have it back and

3025.92 --> 3030.319
forth about this

3027.559 --> 3034.4
because it is just so ridiculous at this

3030.319 --> 3038.079
point it's just I'm not a medical doctor

3034.4 --> 3041.079
so I don't have a lot of details at the

3038.079 --> 3043.1600000000003
ready with it it's just that I've been

3041.079 --> 3045.44
paying attention to this kind of thing

3043.16 --> 3047.8799999999997
for 20 years basically ever since my

3045.44 --> 3047.88
mother

3048.839 --> 3055.68
died yeah what is cancer anyway

3052.92 --> 3057.839
exactly well according to the German new

3055.68 --> 3062.1189999999997
medicine

3057.839 --> 3062.119
which is a very alternative

3062.2 --> 3069.24
system like it's basically part of of

3065.599 --> 3069.2400000000002
the bodily restoration

3080.52 --> 3088.28
mechanism so it's like you have it in

3084.799 --> 3090.88
you and it does things and especially it

3088.28 --> 3095.0
does things in response

3090.88 --> 3098.559
to emotional trauma

3095.0 --> 3102.119
even so that effectively people have

3098.559 --> 3106.7200000000003
like micro cancer you could

3102.119 --> 3109.119
say that just does its thing and it it

3106.72 --> 3111.0789999999997
does it mostly undetected you might have

3109.119 --> 3113.319
a little bit of discomfort or something

3111.079 --> 3116.079
and feel like oh I'm bit

3113.319 --> 3117.68
off you're like a little bit sickish or

3116.079 --> 3120.52
like h

3117.68 --> 3122.72
and if you're stupid enough you might go

3120.52 --> 3124.839
to the doctor and do some [ __ ] blood

3122.72 --> 3126.3999999999996
tests and then it'll be like oh my God

3124.839 --> 3130.16
you have this terrible thing you're

3126.4 --> 3133.0
going to die in a few weeks or something

3130.16 --> 3134.96
idiotic and then you're [ __ ] and then

3133.0 --> 3137.88
you might be seduced into taking

3134.96 --> 3142.079
supposed medicine that will aggravate

3137.88 --> 3142.079
everything and actually make it

3143.44 --> 3150.28
lethal instead of just like yeah

3147.68 --> 3152.5589999999997
I'm just never going to go to the doctor

3150.28 --> 3156.079
for this kind of

3152.559 --> 3160.0
[ __ ] like unless there's like extreme

3156.079 --> 3162.96
palpable physical discomfort or like an

3160.0 --> 3165.319
egregious disability that just suddenly

3162.96 --> 3169.2400000000002
happens because it's like

3165.319 --> 3172.04
ah something really

3169.24 --> 3174.319
heavy right but anything other than

3172.04 --> 3177.119
something really egregious and heavy

3174.319 --> 3179.44
it's like uh just let your body take

3177.119 --> 3182.119
care of it take it easy don't

3179.44 --> 3185.88
overstress

3182.119 --> 3189.319
maybe get some extra nourishment some

3185.88 --> 3192.2000000000003
extra minerals in there or something and

3189.319 --> 3192.2
it'll just be

3196.599 --> 3202.6800000000003
fine your friend just died for yeah sure

3199.48 --> 3207.16
he did sure he

3202.68 --> 3210.04
did I'm sure he never did any medical

3207.16 --> 3212.52
experimentations or anything right never

3210.04 --> 3212.52
touched

3218.24 --> 3221.72
anything bord

3221.88 --> 3225.52
boy I'm sure he

3229.41 --> 3237.5989999999997
[Music]

3234.48 --> 3241.04
did now that's not what I asked for I

3237.599 --> 3243.599
not asking for the treatment I'm asking

3241.04 --> 3248.079
for his

3243.599 --> 3248.079
food and medical

3248.72 --> 3257.5989999999997
habits I'm sure he was an all organic

3253.96 --> 3260.96
guy right that never used any kind of

3257.599 --> 3260.96
medical stuff for

3265.359 --> 3271.88
anything and I'm being

3269.04 --> 3274.72
sarcastic because people like that they

3271.88 --> 3274.7200000000003
don't get

3289.2 --> 3292.2
it

3295.319 --> 3298.319
right

3302.96 --> 3309.559
because that stuff doesn't just appear

3306.359 --> 3309.5589999999997
out of nowhere

3310.52 --> 3315.319
randomly he was in his 7s

3318.72 --> 3322.0789999999997
H then

3323.119 --> 3326.88
still it doesn't just come out of

3325.64 --> 3330.319
nowhere

3326.88 --> 3330.319
like that you miss

3332.48 --> 3338.44
him yeah well I'm sorry for your loss

3335.559 --> 3338.44
but I

3339.0 --> 3343.0
mean I'm making a point

3355.24 --> 3358.24
here

3358.88 --> 3362.48
does the technique help for

3368.64 --> 3373.7599999999998
cancer no not really

3380.64 --> 3386.96
no like all the technique does is like

3384.16 --> 3389.2
connect your spirit spiritual

3386.96 --> 3392.079
elements

3389.2 --> 3394.799
up with your bodily elements so that it

3392.079 --> 3397.3590000000004
works better I mean it might have a

3394.799 --> 3397.359
positive

3398.72 --> 3403.839
influence but that positive influence

3401.2 --> 3403.839
just going to be

3415.24 --> 3418.24
secondary

3427.44 --> 3431.88
citations dude I don't know what you're

3429.52 --> 3431.88
talking

3445.16 --> 3448.16
about

3455.079 --> 3460.799
that's weird thing to say

3457.119 --> 3462.88
LG right but yeah I mean people can

3460.799 --> 3467.16
still die of it it's just what I'm

3462.88 --> 3469.48
saying is it doesn't just come out of

3467.16 --> 3474.8799999999997
nowhere without

3469.48 --> 3474.88
anything making it as aggressive like

3475.119 --> 3478.119
that

3484.16 --> 3489.52
what are some of those many

3486.28 --> 3493.2400000000002
cures well monoclonal antibodies for

3489.52 --> 3493.24
example and apricot

3493.559 --> 3497.2400000000002
seeds cannabis

3497.319 --> 3504.7599999999998
oil

3499.92 --> 3508.119
uh what do you call it again uh baking

3504.76 --> 3508.119
powder work

3511.28 --> 3516.2000000000003
electrical what do you call it yeah

3513.319 --> 3516.2
monoclonal

3516.599 --> 3523.119
antibodies that's what I

3519.2 --> 3526.5589999999997
said mono what yeah the point is is is

3523.119 --> 3526.559
more than I can keep track

3529.28 --> 3532.76
of you had

3535.039 --> 3538.039
diabetes

3540.079 --> 3547.119
right there is a connect

3543.68 --> 3551.0389999999998
yeah there is there will be if he had

3547.119 --> 3554.6800000000003
diabetes that means if it was that heavy

3551.039 --> 3557.3590000000004
then he will have had medical

3554.68 --> 3558.799
interventions I mean if you lost the leg

3557.359 --> 3560.72
you're going to have a medical

3558.799 --> 3562.559
intervention guess what happens when

3560.72 --> 3566.52
there's a medical

3562.559 --> 3568.7200000000003
intervention they inject [ __ ] into you

3566.52 --> 3571.96
yeah allopathic

3568.72 --> 3575.64
based things that are like oh it's

3571.96 --> 3581.079
necessary for the procedure yeah

3575.64 --> 3585.68
yeah with tons and tons of side effects

3581.079 --> 3585.6800000000003
but I mean you're in a rush

3586.01 --> 3589.1690000000003
[Music]

3595.039 --> 3601.92
right so yeah that explains bers boy I

3598.799 --> 3607.28
mean it really does I mean that's just

3601.92 --> 3610.76
like oh okay yeah so he had a diabetes

3607.28 --> 3613.76
issue to the point where he had medical

3610.76 --> 3613.76
intervention

3615.319 --> 3623.96
dramatically yeah that sounds like a

3618.96 --> 3627.96
body heavily in unbalanced and then yeah

3623.96 --> 3627.96
then it can completely get out of

3631.799 --> 3639.319
hand right but a perfectly fine healthy

3636.76 --> 3641.44
person especially at that age that's

3639.319 --> 3644.48
like eating organic all their life and

3641.44 --> 3647.2400000000002
like never like does

3644.48 --> 3650.16
anything like doesn't just rely on the

3647.24 --> 3651.24
doctor for whatever like they don't get

3650.16 --> 3654.8799999999997
it like

3651.24 --> 3654.8799999999997
that that never

3654.92 --> 3657.92
happens

3661.039 --> 3666.5200000000004
monal antibodies are used in mainstream

3664.039 --> 3671.3190000000004
oh my God how dare

3666.52 --> 3671.319
you how dare I I mention

3674.68 --> 3680.319
it right so it's just getting mainstream

3677.88 --> 3684.2000000000003
then but people still say there's no

3680.319 --> 3684.2
cure to cancer that's my

3684.559 --> 3689.799
point that was my point is that it's

3687.44 --> 3692.92
complete

3689.799 --> 3697.96
nonsense the amount of ways that

3692.92 --> 3697.96
supposedly pure cancer is off the

3700.48 --> 3703.48
charts

3714.839 --> 3719.799
right

3717.68 --> 3722.5589999999997
but it becomes a problem when there's a

3719.799 --> 3724.88
medical intervention and more and more

3722.559 --> 3727.6800000000003
and more then eventually it's like yeah

3724.88 --> 3728.76
there's been too much [ __ ] going on

3727.68 --> 3733.68
with the

3728.76 --> 3733.6800000000003
body and then anything becomes

3734.44 --> 3741.279
risky if you supposedly get anything

3737.92 --> 3745.279
cancer related in a fully healthy body

3741.279 --> 3748.119
you probably won't even notice it and

3745.279 --> 3750.44
it'll just just go away again it will do

3748.119 --> 3750.44
its

3750.64 --> 3755.359
thing get a bit of a bulge whatever

3753.48 --> 3758.2
somewhere

3755.359 --> 3761.0789999999997
internally it'll harden up and then

3758.2 --> 3763.24
it'll break down and dissolve again and

3761.079 --> 3767.76
it's like it was never there and you're

3763.24 --> 3767.7599999999998
just fixed and you won't even know it

3768.52 --> 3774.92
happened but if you got a lot of medical

3771.88 --> 3777.6800000000003
interventions somehow and surgeries and

3774.92 --> 3780.079
all these injection that come with that

3777.68 --> 3782.0789999999997
which is standard procedure and like

3780.079 --> 3785.1600000000003
anesthetics and whatever dude you don't

3782.079 --> 3786.599
even know what the hell they put in the

3785.16 --> 3790.839
anesthetics

3786.599 --> 3794.48
anymore this weird experimental [ __ ] all

3790.839 --> 3798.599
over the place the entire [ __ ] system

3794.48 --> 3802.319
there is getting weird

3798.599 --> 3804.039
experimentation just being just rolled

3802.319 --> 3807.7599999999998
in

3804.039 --> 3807.76
there yeah

3808.119 --> 3811.6400000000003
so you get enough medical interventions

3810.48 --> 3815.48
for

3811.64 --> 3818.96
whatever and then suddenly yeah then the

3815.48 --> 3821.72
the the tide has changed and now it can

3818.96 --> 3821.7200000000003
become very

3827.559 --> 3834.0
dangerous right so that's how I see it

3831.0 --> 3837.079
I'm not a medical doctor I can have my

3834.0 --> 3839.119
opinion about these things

3837.079 --> 3842.96
and I live those

3839.119 --> 3842.96
opinions I live like

3843.079 --> 3851.52
this and I'll survive like

3847.119 --> 3854.88
this and hey you people out there

3851.52 --> 3857.96
watching this you can do with it

3854.88 --> 3860.1600000000003
whatever you want you want to ignore it

3857.96 --> 3862.64
you want to follow standard procedures

3860.16 --> 3867.72
then you go right

3862.64 --> 3867.72
ahead not my problem

3870.4 --> 3881.13
I'll be doing it my

3872.52 --> 3881.13
[Music]

3881.96 --> 3887.52
way do you think doctors go to work to

3885.76 --> 3890.559
try

3887.52 --> 3894.119
no but they follow with system in which

3890.559 --> 3898.6400000000003
people may very easily get killed and

3894.119 --> 3898.6400000000003
then it's just oh just collateral

3900.119 --> 3906.799
damage yeah Fester from Lester you think

3903.96 --> 3909.7200000000003
that soldiers that are sent out to get

3906.799 --> 3914.319
some terrorists or whatever you think

3909.72 --> 3918.2
they go out to basically get children

3914.319 --> 3921.88
and women blown up do you think that

3918.2 --> 3923.52
when they go out let's let's go we got a

3921.88 --> 3925.119
Target you think that they're going out

3923.52 --> 3927.16
there in their minds like yeah we're

3925.119 --> 3931.799
going to blow up some children and women

3927.16 --> 3935.16
today no no but it does sometimes happen

3931.799 --> 3938.119
it's called collateral damage yeah

3935.16 --> 3941.3999999999996
that's how that works yeah same goes

3938.119 --> 3944.44
with doctors when they go to work yeah

3941.4 --> 3947.1600000000003
they're just following procedures oh oh

3944.44 --> 3950.44
some people just suddenly convulse and

3947.16 --> 3952.5989999999997
die oh oh well nothing you can do about

3950.44 --> 3956.599
it you followed procedure so there's no

3952.599 --> 3959.52
blame for you right

3956.599 --> 3963.2400000000002
yeah that's how that

3959.52 --> 3965.96
works it's called allopathic medicine

3963.24 --> 3967.319
you're a robot in a system you don't

3965.96 --> 3969.76
understand what the hell that system

3967.319 --> 3971.319
even does to people you're just

3969.76 --> 3975.0
following

3971.319 --> 3977.68
procedure and then you don't get the

3975.0 --> 3981.279
blame yeah that's how that

3977.68 --> 3984.5589999999997
works it's non-holistic it makes a lot

3981.279 --> 3986.73
of money though

3984.559 --> 3988.44
huh

3986.73 --> 3989.88
[Music]

3988.44 --> 3992.92

you yeah hey Gary Fe what's a thin nice

4075.839 --> 4081.799
about

4077.559 --> 4085.52
it was anything I said completely out of

4081.799 --> 4085.52
whack was it

4089.4 --> 4092.92
disproportional was it

4101.529 --> 4107.4400000000005
[Music]

4104.44 --> 4107.44
unrealistic

4110.56 --> 4115.839000000001
oh you have a family in that do you

4112.319 --> 4120.04
debatable D good for you they make a lot

4115.839 --> 4120.04
of money don't they

4134.44 --> 4137.44
h

4164.359 --> 4167.359
for

4175.159 --> 4177.96
hey seeking star

[Music]

4194.32 --> 4197.32
Waters

4199.12 --> 4203.8
how dare I challenge debatable D's

4204.28 --> 4211.36
indoctrination dude I don't give a [ __ ]

4206.76 --> 4214.0
dude it's his problem hey oh you're old

4211.36 --> 4217.0
medical people oh well I'm very sorry

4214.0 --> 4219.52
for you that means that you share that

4217.0 --> 4224.32
burden that karmic burden

4219.52 --> 4227.0
yeah the exchange for wealth Earthly

4224.32 --> 4230.4
wealth

4227.0 --> 4233.48
for just a little bit of medical

4230.4 --> 4234.92
intervention that will eventually amount

4233.48 --> 4237.799999999999
to

4234.92 --> 4241.08
death I'm sure it's worth the tradeoff

4237.8 --> 4241.08
though right debatable

4243.719 --> 4250.52
d right as long as those practitioners

4248.4 --> 4254.239
in your family think they're doing the

4250.52 --> 4256.92
right thing what could go wrong

4254.239 --> 4259.28
right

4256.92 --> 4261.04
it only becomes problematic when they

4259.28 --> 4263.5199999999995
become

4261.04 --> 4266.56
conscious of what it is they're actually

4263.52 --> 4269.96
doing how they're actually influencing

4266.56 --> 4273.76
everybody and then continue that's when

4269.96 --> 4273.76
it becomes problematic for

4281.28 --> 4286.48
God saved a fair amount of number on the

4284.12 --> 4290.599999999999
search I'm sure they

4286.48 --> 4290.599999999999
did and I'm not against

4293.32 --> 4297.0
that it's just

4301.28 --> 4309.679
that most doctors and surgeons they

4304.6 --> 4312.280000000001
don't really keep track of like the

4309.679 --> 4314.639
anesthetics the type of stuff that is

4312.28 --> 4316.32
being used that the patient is being

4314.639 --> 4319.08
subjected

4316.32 --> 4322.12
too they don't really keep up to date

4319.08 --> 4325.6
with that too much and they just use

4322.12 --> 4327.719
standard procedure there which is

4325.6 --> 4331.4400000000005
reliable enough

4327.719 --> 4334.04
right it just has this kind of long-term

4331.44 --> 4336.0
consequences that you can't really be

4334.04 --> 4337.96
bothered with as a surgeon because

4336.0 --> 4339.8
you're just about oh I just have to save

4337.96 --> 4341.92
him right now right that's the

4339.8 --> 4344.159000000001
allopathic way you have to save him

4341.92 --> 4346.52
right now anything

4344.159 --> 4348.679
goes right don't think about the

4346.52 --> 4351.280000000001
long-term consequences of what you're

4348.679 --> 4351.28
putting in

4351.52 --> 4356.719
them I get it that's the typical

4363.32 --> 4368.84
issue right oh they're very open to

4366.719 --> 4372.159
Alternative well that's

4368.84 --> 4372.159000000001
good that's

4374.12 --> 4377.12
great

4379.12 --> 4383.199
that's right FL Sage that's exactly my

4381.36 --> 4384.719
thought like I don't have anything

4383.199 --> 4388.879999999999
against

4384.719 --> 4391.719
surgery it's great it's a good skill

4388.88 --> 4391.719
it's good that it

4392.96 --> 4396.56
exists it's just

4397.28 --> 4405.88
not not a really a go-to

4401.6 --> 4408.76
thing for health advice for

4405.88 --> 4408.76
self-maintenance

4413.4 --> 4419.28
it's crisis skills and crisis skills are

4423.159 --> 4429.719
necessary but not a good go-to place for

4426.88 --> 4429.719
general

4434.04 --> 4437.04
maintenance

4443.83 --> 4447.0

4455.239 --> 4464.04

4458.159 --> 4465.599999999999
this a surgeon can be a precious

4464.04 --> 4467.8
commodity

4465.6 --> 4470.8
very

4467.8 --> 4476.12
important but

4470.8 --> 4479.6
then often people go from surgery

4476.12 --> 4479.599999999999
to Big

4480.56 --> 4487.120000000001
Pharma oh they have

4482.8 --> 4489.639
to take a little pain medication or some

4487.12 --> 4492.5599999999995
other stuff and then oh what yeah what

4489.639 --> 4494.0
is that going to do to them right

4492.56 --> 4496.88
there's the

4494.0 --> 4500.8
problem

4496.88 --> 4503.1990000000005
right surgery great problem is Big

4500.8 --> 4506.4400000000005
Pharma always puts their foot in the

4503.199 --> 4508.08
door doesn't it always has to have their

4506.44 --> 4511.678999999999
little

4508.08 --> 4514.08
angle oh it just use this little pain

4511.679 --> 4517.04
medication I'm sure it won't have any

4514.08 --> 4517.04
negative side

really you're going to bring in elves

4558.08 --> 4560.32
and

4567.08 --> 4577.679
wizards yeah the thing is if elves ate

4572.12 --> 4577.679

4578.199 --> 4581.199
long

4581.239 --> 4586.919999999999

[Music]

4823.639 --> 4826.639
know

4842.44 --> 4848.5199999999995
all right yeah the discovery of

4844.719 --> 4848.52
artificial fertilizer

4849.159 --> 4856.638999999999
yeah bombs yeah whatever oh it made

4852.679 --> 4856.639
bombs I'm sure they did

4859.0 --> 4865.48
I

4861.0 --> 4869.12
mean without that there would still just

4865.48 --> 4869.12
be people be

4871.679 --> 4877.88
killed but yeah that that scientist that

4875.44 --> 4882.879999999999
figured out how to make artificial

4877.88 --> 4882.88
fertilizer like it's been the

4883.56 --> 4888.2390000000005
biggest

4885.199 --> 4890.0
like thorn in the eye of the Eugenics

4888.239 --> 4893.08
movement of all

4890.0 --> 4895.48
times because they basically made it

4893.08 --> 4898.4
possible for Regions that

4895.48 --> 4902.199
are almost uninhabitable because of the

4898.4 --> 4902.199
soil quality to still grow

4902.96 --> 4908.76
food using like artificial

4909.679 --> 4915.679
fertilizer his Discovery also led to

4912.36 --> 4919.96
chemical oh really his led to chemical

4915.679 --> 4921.84
warfare or did the chemical Revolution

4919.96 --> 4925.2390000000005
lead to chemical

4928.96 --> 4934.4800000000005

[Music]

4943.52 --> 4946.52
d

4964.08 --> 4971.08
legitimate use for masks yeah no hey

4967.92 --> 4975.4
masks should definitely be

4971.08 --> 4978.679
used like for actual dust

4975.4 --> 4981.48
especially if it's toxic dust that's not

4978.679 --> 4985.56
you know like manure

4981.48 --> 4985.5599999999995
dust not good to breathe that

4988.76 --> 4995.400000000001
in like you're cleaning out the

4991.96 --> 4999.28
Stables it's pretty recommendable to put

4995.4 --> 4999.28
on a mask if you're doing

5003.44 --> 5006.44
that

5010.32 --> 5014.28
or bandan sure I

5015.92 --> 5021.719
mean the point is yeah you don't want to

5018.96 --> 5025.92
breathe in that kind of dust it's very

5021.719 --> 5029.08
unhealthy like can lead to very acute

5029.08 --> 5031.96
painful and

oh [ __ ] is as bad as bad [ __ ] no yeah

5050.0 --> 5054.56
but that's because bad [ __ ] is just more

5059.48 --> 5065.799999999999
concentrated like bigger animals have

5062.719 --> 5069.159
more digestion going

5065.8 --> 5072.4400000000005
on and it's more

5069.159 --> 5074.96
rough what comes out well a small

5072.44 --> 5079.5199999999995
creature like a bat like their

5074.96 --> 5083.44
intestines are smaller like it's more

5079.52 --> 5083.4400000000005
thoroughly refined

5089.32 --> 5093.32
basically so you can consider it

5091.639 --> 5096.32
chemically more

5093.32 --> 5096.32
intense

5108.679 --> 5112.719
yeah that's right yeah medical

5111.04 --> 5114.679
professionals yeah during surgery they

5112.719 --> 5117.2390000000005
wear a mask to prevent spittle from

5114.679 --> 5117.2390000000005
getting in the

5118.08 --> 5126.32
wounds because that has been proven to

5120.88 --> 5126.32
give like inflammation problems

5140.36 --> 5143.08
right but I

5145.08 --> 5149.159
mean

5146.639 --> 5151.36
dust

5149.159 --> 5153.879999999999
spittle that that's the kind of thing

5151.36 --> 5156.239
that can like in open wounds give

5153.88 --> 5156.2390000000005
problems

5162.6 --> 5168.52
and that's pretty much it like on your

5165.0 --> 5168.52
skin it's not really going to do

5183.239 --> 5186.239
anything

5213.239 --> 5216.239

5450.84 --> 5456.6
not sounds like you got some experience

5453.6 --> 5458.96
with the fruitfully stopping by asking

5456.6 --> 5458.96
you

5477.36 --> 5480.759999999999
questions SC

5482.92 --> 5485.92
some

5487.0 --> 5492.719
well was it properly ripened yet what I

5490.199 --> 5496.839999999999
mean was the Kiwi kind of

5492.719 --> 5498.52
soft did you like peel it properly

5496.84 --> 5502.04
before you took a

5498.52 --> 5506.56
bite cuz the peel of kiwis can be pretty

5502.04 --> 5506.56
hard so maybe you just like paper cut

5510.96 --> 5519.199
it told you it can eat the skin

5515.44 --> 5519.199
yeah I wouldn't be doing that if I were

5522.239 --> 5528.36
you I mean you could probably

5524.84 --> 5531.639
technically eat it but I mean

5528.36 --> 5533.88
no I don't see why You' eat the skin of

5531.639 --> 5533.88
a

5537.719 --> 5544.32
kiwi yeah so that probably just

5541.719 --> 5547.6
functioned like a paper cut I mean i'

5544.32 --> 5547.599999999999
I've had that I think with

5550.48 --> 5556.718999999999
kiwis especially when they're like not

5553.159 --> 5559.44
properly ripened yet like kiwis can be

5556.719 --> 5559.44
pretty damn

5564.76 --> 5572.92
hard rip kiwi can give you Medical burn

5569.119 --> 5575.839999999999
uh a chemical burn I don't know about

5572.92 --> 5575.84
that

5583.0 --> 5588.6
it has fire okay blue Evolution I've

5585.8 --> 5588.6
never heard of

5593.119 --> 5602.759999999999
that scrapped the

5596.48 --> 5604.5599999999995
fruit from skin yeah well that way then

5602.76 --> 5606.92
yeah

5604.56 --> 5610.1990000000005
you probably paper cut

5606.92 --> 5610.1990000000005
yourself like

5612.32 --> 5616.36
that no it's not a kiwi

5616.639 --> 5623.28
allergy dude if it was a kiwi allergy

5619.56 --> 5625.639
he'd have Cuts all you would like be in

5623.28 --> 5628.239
a pretty bad

5625.639 --> 5630.2390000000005
shape cuz then it wouldn't just be his

5628.239 --> 5632.48
lips it would be like his entire mouth

5630.239 --> 5635.718999999999
and his throat and

5632.48 --> 5635.718999999999
everything so

5647.92 --> 5653.8
and rip kiwi or more stiffer sharper

5651.28 --> 5653.8
yeah could

5656.8 --> 5664.639
be I don't know when I deal with KES I

5660.4 --> 5666.599999999999
just like to peel the skin off before I

5664.639 --> 5669.1990000000005
take a bite out of the

5666.6 --> 5673.56
Kiwi I've had some bad experience with

5669.199 --> 5673.5599999999995
cutting myself with the kiwi skin

5687.96 --> 5693.32
too and maybe there is some kind of

5690.639 --> 5695.96
allergy thing about the skin with kiwis

5693.32 --> 5699.08
I don't what that is but even like when

5695.96 --> 5701.44
I feel a kiwi in my hand there's

5699.08 --> 5703.679
something about it that just feels wrong

5701.44 --> 5703.678999999999
it's

5703.719 --> 5709.32
like I like what's inside but it's just

5706.48 --> 5713.5199999999995
like the outside is like it it feels

5709.32 --> 5713.5199999999995

5719.52 --> 5725.639

5850.84 --> 5856.88
apple like an apple that's not even

5853.239 --> 5860.239
super sized it'll cost you like a

5856.88 --> 5862.0
Euro then you have bananas that are

5860.239 --> 5866.759999999999
decently

5862.0 --> 5870.679
sized and you can like get two bananas

5866.76 --> 5872.4400000000005
full bananas for less than a Euro and

5870.679 --> 5874.88
I'm like what the

5872.44 --> 5879.96
hell

5874.88 --> 5882.92
like this apple is like from this

5879.96 --> 5885.0
country grown in this country the banana

5882.92 --> 5887.2390000000005
definitely not grown in this country how

5885.0 --> 5890.639
the hell is the banana

5887.239 --> 5892.678999999999
cheaper than the locally grown Apple I

5890.639 --> 5895.76
don't get

5892.679 --> 5897.84
it it's been like that forever I totally

5895.76 --> 5900.84
don't understand like how that

5897.84 --> 5900.84
works

5901.719 --> 5908.52
like that they just get them for

5905.56 --> 5910.8
free like do they cost 1 cent and the

5908.52 --> 5912.76
rest is just all Logistics I mean those

5910.8 --> 5915.08
things have to be freaking transported

5912.76 --> 5917.4800000000005
halfway around the world how the hell

5915.08 --> 5923.04
are they cheaper than locally grown

5917.48 --> 5923.04
apples I just don't get it it's really

5932.44 --> 5936.678999999999

5934.119 --> 5939.199
but kiwis yeah I mean I'm not personally

5936.679 --> 5941.159
a big kiwi fan like sometimes I get them

5939.199 --> 5943.36
because it's just like it just feels

5941.159 --> 5945.28
like the right time to get a kiwi

5943.36 --> 5949.119
especially in in like the middle of

5945.28 --> 5949.119
summer when it's really hot they're

5950.08 --> 5958.119
great or if you have like a a fruit

5953.56 --> 5958.119000000001
salad then they can be a good part of

5962.36 --> 5965.36
that

5972.239 --> 5980.919999999999
five organic bananas for 150

5976.36 --> 5980.92
yeah six organic apples for

5982.44 --> 5987.48
two

5984.48 --> 5990.28

from

6034.84 --> 6041.4800000000005
well Whole Foods I mean that's super

6038.599 --> 6044.4400000000005
reliable mega store organic I mean

6041.48 --> 6044.44
they're so super

6096.76 --> 6099.599
I don't know what you're talking about

6098.159 --> 6103.199
FL

6099.599 --> 6105.76
what I don't think they spray anything

6103.199 --> 6108.36
on bananas to rip in the process that's

6105.76 --> 6108.360000000001
not how that

6108.52 --> 6115.040000000001
works bananas when they get picked they

6112.28 --> 6117.96
get picked green

6115.04 --> 6122.32
green because if you wait until they're

6117.96 --> 6124.92
yellow to pick them then as soon as you

6122.32 --> 6127.679
like start transport they're going to be

6124.92 --> 6130.719
completely Brown by the time they arrive

6127.679 --> 6132.599
they pick them green and then it takes a

6130.719 --> 6134.04
standard amount of time to just

6132.599 --> 6138.28
naturally

6134.04 --> 6141.119
ripen to Yellow so they time it they

6138.28 --> 6142.159
time it very carefully that's how they

6141.119 --> 6145.28
do

6142.159 --> 6147.879999999999
it they don't spray them with anything

6145.28 --> 6152.159
as far as I

6147.88 --> 6152.159000000001
know especially with organic

6161.639 --> 6168.119
bananas I saw like this mini documentary

6164.92 --> 6169.719
about bananas about that and it's really

6168.119 --> 6172.5599999999995
all about the

6169.719 --> 6175.119
timing they cut them off the tree when

6172.56 --> 6175.119000000001
they're still

6175.719 --> 6180.8
green and then as they are getting

6178.119 --> 6183.08
transported they they gradually change

6180.8 --> 6186.84
color like they don't even have to be

6183.08 --> 6186.84
exposed to sunlight for that to

6202.119 --> 6206.36
happen

6211.0 --> 6216.88
away you not

6213.92 --> 6219.119
continually going to the doctor for your

6216.88 --> 6222.8
medical advice and especially Health

6219.119 --> 6222.799999999999

away just not being whiny and [ __ ]

6227.36 --> 6231.4
about small little issues you

6232.04 --> 6235.04
got

6241.199 --> 6247.759999999999
besides like eating an apple every day

6245.199 --> 6249.719
there's there it's like apples are kind

6247.76 --> 6253.119000000001
of acidic in in a

6249.719 --> 6255.96
way you shouldn't eat them every day

6253.119 --> 6258.119
really you should eat them whenever your

6255.96 --> 6261.04
body is calling you to do that it's like

6258.119 --> 6263.88
you need some apples right now then you

6261.04 --> 6267.719
should eat them same goes for bananas I

6263.88 --> 6270.4400000000005
mean bananas are even set to oddly have

6267.719 --> 6272.56
some weird radioactivity to them because

6270.44 --> 6275.598999999999
of the potassium that that's what I've

6272.56 --> 6278.8
heard so if you eat them every

6275.599 --> 6282.2390000000005
day it might not be super

6278.8 --> 6283.639
great it's weird though I mean you're

6282.239 --> 6286.0
probably not going to get sick from

6283.639 --> 6287.4400000000005
eating bananas every day and you're

6286.0 --> 6291.4
probably not going to lose all your

6287.44 --> 6291.4
teeth from eating an apple every day

6291.679 --> 6297.2390000000005
but you don't don't need to eat

6294.159 --> 6297.239
everything every

6298.88 --> 6303.52
day like it's just a swing of the

6301.52 --> 6306.320000000001
pendulum goes up and down and when your

6303.52 --> 6308.8
body is like calling out like oh apples

6306.32 --> 6311.199
apples apples that's when you need to

6308.8 --> 6311.1990000000005
eat

6311.96 --> 6317.04
apples and that doesn't mean like oh my

6314.96 --> 6319.04
body called for me to eat apples that

6317.04 --> 6323.0
means from now on I'm going to have to

6319.04 --> 6324.639
eat an apple every day no you just need

6323.0 --> 6326.88
need to eat it when your body's calling

6324.639 --> 6326.88
for

6330.679 --> 6337.88
it right blue Evolution it they

6334.4 --> 6340.28
do but an Apple at the right time when

6337.88 --> 6344.119
your body is really calling for it it

6340.28 --> 6346.48
does great it it really does do a lot of

6344.119 --> 6348.48
good just doesn't mean that you actually

6346.48 --> 6351.32
have to eat it every

6348.48 --> 6354.07
day just at certain periods when your

6351.32 --> 6357.32
body's calling out for it

6381.92 --> 6384.92
weird

6389.4 --> 6393.119
My grandmother used to tell me old

6392.199 --> 6395.799999999999
people

6393.119 --> 6398.32
knowledge yeah

6395.8 --> 6401.0
well kind of feels to me like old

6398.32 --> 6401.0
television

6401.679 --> 6406.719
knowledge apples have cyanide in their

6404.4 --> 6410.159
seeds yeah you're actually supposed to

6406.719 --> 6410.159
eat those did you know

6411.4 --> 6420.119
that did you know that the cyanide and

6414.52 --> 6424.159000000001
apple seeds are actually a good form of

6420.119 --> 6425.36
cyanide that it allegedly even helps

6424.159 --> 6430.32
against

6425.36 --> 6436.32
cancer the bitterness of them like

6430.32 --> 6436.32
animals eat apples with the seeds and

6441.84 --> 6446.159000000001
everything

6443.48 --> 6450.04
now me personally I don't really like

6446.159 --> 6455.36
eating the seeds but I'll keep in mind

6450.04 --> 6457.719
like it's gross but it's probably good

6455.36 --> 6459.48
especially like if you're in a if your

6457.719 --> 6461.32
body is kind of feeble or you had a

6459.48 --> 6464.199
period where you ate way too much sugar

6461.32 --> 6466.639
or anything your candida is

6464.199 --> 6470.598999999999
overflowing then actually eating the

6466.639 --> 6473.28
apple seeds might be a

6470.599 --> 6476.599
benefit just like eating apricot God

6473.28 --> 6476.599
seeds is a

6494.52 --> 6500.4400000000005
benefit except the amount of sin in the

6497.48 --> 6503.759999999999
yeah not just that flut Sage it's it's a

6500.44 --> 6508.36
bound form of cyanide

6503.76 --> 6511.2390000000005
yeah it's not chemically pure Unbound

6508.36 --> 6513.36
cyanide when it's like cyanide gas which

6511.239 --> 6517.44
is basically the normal form of the

6513.36 --> 6520.679
Unbound cyanide that stuff is really

6517.44 --> 6523.719
deadly CU it like reacts with everything

6520.679 --> 6526.36
and kills it very quickly but when you

6523.719 --> 6530.4
bind it chemically with something else

6526.36 --> 6534.199
which is the normal condition in nature

6530.4 --> 6537.44
like if you find cyanide in a fruit in a

6534.199 --> 6540.5599999999995
seed or in whatever it's G to be bound

6537.44 --> 6544.5199999999995
to something else

6540.56 --> 6548.639
then it's not so lethal it becomes

6544.52 --> 6551.320000000001
lethal when you chemically purify it and

6548.639 --> 6554.36
make it Unbound that's when it's the

6551.32 --> 6554.36
really dangerous

6561.719 --> 6567.52
poison

6563.44 --> 6569.119
cyanide in seeds is not pure cyanide

6567.52 --> 6574.4400000000005
it's it's

6569.119 --> 6574.44
bound and then it actually gives you

6574.84 --> 6583.679
benefits just like AA seeds are

6578.52 --> 6583.679
proven to give you benefits against

6585.08 --> 6590.0

6595.159 --> 6600.0
stop being annoyingly nitpicky de

6608.04 --> 6615.32
unbounded whatever you know what the

right

6739.159 --> 6746.28
Dam I what's that call again oh yeah

6743.76 --> 6748.84
yeah did you know that

6746.28 --> 6752.159
Marsen is made of almonds and that

6748.84 --> 6755.96
maripan is known to

6752.159 --> 6760.04
have bound cyanide within

6755.96 --> 6763.04
it and if you eat too much of it

6760.04 --> 6766.48
marpin besides getting sugar

6763.04 --> 6769.4
poisoning you may also get

6766.48 --> 6772.678999999999
some

6769.4 --> 6774.638999999999
residual cyanide type effects which give

6772.679 --> 6778.76
you like a

6774.639 --> 6782.36
headache cuz there's a lot of

6778.76 --> 6786.56
nuts that have bonded cyanide in them

6782.36 --> 6786.5599999999995
and it's actually kind of

6787.199 --> 6794.159
good I mean not to have it all the time

6791.0 --> 6797.04
but it it serves a certain function in

6794.159 --> 6797.04
the chem in the

6801.199 --> 6808.04
biochemistry so with maripan it actually

6804.159 --> 6808.04
is the sugar that kind of ruins

6831.44 --> 6834.44
it

6842.639 --> 6851.32

6845.28 --> 6851.32
has no limits and one has no connections

6861.36 --> 6864.36

6877.52 --> 6881.75

beans

6905.079 --> 6910.719

6908.4 --> 6910.719
are

6911.599 --> 6921.119000000001

interesting right I'm not saying like oh

6942.92 --> 6947.599
man you should like eat every type of

6945.44 --> 6951.96
seed or whatever I don't

6947.599 --> 6954.88
know I have not done a study or heard

6951.96 --> 6958.639
about studies in that direction I mostly

6954.88 --> 6960.88
heard about apricot seeds that

6958.639 --> 6966.2390000000005
specifically apricot

6960.88 --> 6969.96
seeds can be or have been tested

6966.239 --> 6973.0
widely by alternative medical researches

6969.96 --> 6977.159
to to help with

6973.0 --> 6980.84
cancer apricot seeds now all their seeds

6977.159 --> 6980.839999999999
might also do it like apple

6981.0 --> 6986.719
seeds or or I don't know as you say

6983.639 --> 6988.4800000000005
cherry seeds I don't know although yeah

6986.719 --> 6990.04
cherry seeds you're not just going to

6988.48 --> 6992.32
like chew them between your teeth

6990.04 --> 6995.8
because you're going to break your teeth

6992.32 --> 6995.799999999999
right but who

6996.4 --> 7001.0
knows there might be other types of

6998.88 --> 7003.639
seeds that are also like are going to

7001.0 --> 7003.639
have the same

7004.719 --> 7010.44
effect I just heard that apricot seeds

7007.84 --> 7013.719
are like specifically

7010.44 --> 7017.879999999999
tested by alternative medical researches

7013.719 --> 7017.88
and have been found to work really

7035.599 --> 7040.1990000000005

7038.36 --> 7043.92
sunflower

7040.199 --> 7045.5199999999995

7043.92 --> 7049.28

7051.76 --> 7059.360000000001

7060.48 --> 7067.759999999999
oil is going to literally make me stupid

7063.92 --> 7071.92
like make me less concentrated Dumber

7067.76 --> 7073.2390000000005
provably like after just one try all of

7071.92 --> 7074.88
oil

7073.239 --> 7076.0
do it in olive oil I don't have that

7074.88 --> 7078.079
issue at

7076.0 --> 7081.599
all like

7078.079 --> 7084.28
ever so I don't like sunflower seeds I

7081.599 --> 7090.599
mean they're cute plants and

7084.28 --> 7090.599
they're whatever easy cheap I don't like

7090.96 --> 7095.4
them I never liked them like never liked

7093.92 --> 7099.079
eating

7095.4 --> 7104.119
them don't like the the oil I'm not a

7099.079 --> 7104.119
big fan of sunflowers at all

7109.199 --> 7114.0
and if you're going to like chew on some

7111.04 --> 7119.44
kind of nuts then just make give me

7114.0 --> 7119.44
peanuts peanuts are great for

7122.079 --> 7127.0
me although I don't like to eat peanuts

7124.96 --> 7129.4800000000005
all year long or anything but there's

7127.0 --> 7131.04
times where I'm like yeah peanuts man

7129.48 --> 7133.079
peanuts are

7131.04 --> 7136.199
great

7133.079 --> 7140.0
but not always I had a whole phase of

7136.199 --> 7142.44
peanuts like in up

7140.0 --> 7145.52
until the beginning of this

7142.44 --> 7149.04
year where I like with my French fries

7145.52 --> 7153.4800000000005
which I ate a lot in the last two years

7149.04 --> 7156.84
I always had like saté sauuce like made

7153.48 --> 7160.5199999999995
of french fries with War which is like a

7156.84 --> 7165.079
Dutch way to have french fries with some

7160.52 --> 7166.88
saté sauce chipped onions and mayonnaise

7165.079 --> 7168.719
alongside the french fries which is

7166.88 --> 7171.119
great like it's

7168.719 --> 7174.4
lovely but then that one time I got

7171.119 --> 7176.04
really sick while eating that and then

7174.4 --> 7179.199
after that I'm like okay I'm done with

7176.04 --> 7182.0
the saté sauce for a while like if you

7179.199 --> 7183.919999999999
get sick when you're eating peanuts

7182.0 --> 7186.199
you're going to have like an adverse

7183.92 --> 7188.119
reaction against tasting peanuts for a

7186.199 --> 7190.48
while that's what I found every time

7188.119 --> 7194.119
I've gotten like sick like throwing up

7190.48 --> 7196.959999999999
sick while having eaten peanuts you

7194.119 --> 7199.0
weirdly then get an adverse

7196.96 --> 7201.2390000000005
reaction against

7199.0 --> 7203.679
peanuts because of that for a while it's

7201.239 --> 7206.598999999999
weird how that works but that's it seems

7203.679 --> 7206.599
to work like that with

7216.0 --> 7222.52
[Music]

7218.639 --> 7226.76

a fan of

7260.599 --> 7265.96
them into little bits and like put them

7263.56 --> 7267.88
on ice cream or something that'll be

7265.96 --> 7270.2390000000005

7478.599 --> 7484.8
years which is like an amazing luxury

7481.8 --> 7487.28
that there's so much spelled bread

7484.8 --> 7489.76
available within the organic Supermarket

7487.28 --> 7492.199
I'm like really happy but I mean I'm not

7489.76 --> 7494.88
the only one apparently like spell is

7492.199 --> 7497.48
really popular like half of all the

7494.88 --> 7501.159000000001
bread they have is spelled bread which

7497.48 --> 7504.04
is like yes yes excellent and everybody

great like it's it's really great it's

7549.92 --> 7554.92

I've been doing that for like months and

7554.92 --> 7558.32
it's like very

7558.52 --> 7566.280000000001
enjoyable and it's not that expensive

7562.079 --> 7570.159
either and that's kind of how I've been

7566.28 --> 7570.159
eating in the last few

7577.8 --> 7583.559
months all organic of

7580.559 --> 7583.559

I've heard like that are really healthy

7639.32 --> 7645.759999999999
good for the brain too

7643.199 --> 7648.36
I just never really gotten to like them

7645.76 --> 7650.679
I don't like the taste of it I mean if

7648.36 --> 7652.558999999999
there's some complicated salad or

7650.679 --> 7655.32
something and there's pieces of avocado

7652.559 --> 7659.71

7769.199 --> 7776.199
fresh non dried fig fresh

7772.719 --> 7778.8
figs they're pretty amazing flut sage

7776.199 --> 7781.558999999999
like in my own mother's

7778.8 --> 7785.719
house we used to have like a really

7781.559 --> 7789.599
well-doing fig tree huge became like as

7785.719 --> 7794.04
high as my room like this big ball and

7789.599 --> 7797.4400000000005
it would have like a 100

7794.04 --> 7797.44
figs every

7803.84 --> 7809.52
year really

7806.0 --> 7812.239
huge huge amount of fakes and they were

7809.52 --> 7814.84
like pretty

7812.239 --> 7818.36
sweet like we didn't even

7814.84 --> 7821.84
like feeded any special dirt it just

7818.36 --> 7824.4
grew somewhere in between the tile right

7821.84 --> 7824.400000000001
next to the

7824.44 --> 7830.719
house so once you get the fix to grow

7827.199 --> 7830.719
like they they really like to

7831.159 --> 7838.36
grow but fresh figs are really nice nice

7834.96 --> 7841.679
and like subtle sweet they have a subtle

7838.36 --> 7841.679
taste and sweetness to

7849.679 --> 7855.4
them yeah don't use pesticides that's

7863.32 --> 7868.88
terrible especially things that ground

7865.679 --> 7871.599
up it's it's horrendous because it like

7868.88 --> 7873.76
it just seeps in the soil and it won't

7871.599 --> 7877.04
come

7873.76 --> 7877.04
out it's

7877.559 --> 7884.559
terrible some if you like moving a new

7880.8 --> 7888.320000000001
house with a garden you got to

7884.559 --> 7891.119000000001
check B maybe even do soil samples like

7888.32 --> 7893.92
did the previous owner at some point use

7891.119 --> 7895.88
Roundup cuz if they did you're pretty

7893.92 --> 7897.679
much screwed you might have to like dig

7895.88 --> 7900.52
out half the

7897.679 --> 7904.88
garden cuz that stuff is just

7900.52 --> 7904.88
terrible it goes and sits in the

7907.639 --> 7912.28
ground all the cool people are at the

7910.079 --> 7913.159
organic section at the super yeah yeah

7912.28 --> 7915.719
they

7913.159 --> 7918.638999999999
are cuz that's the people that still

7915.719 --> 7922.96
have a functioning

7918.639 --> 7925.4800000000005
brain and know that isn't an

7922.96 --> 7928.8
exaggeration I mean you could literally

7925.48 --> 7930.638999999999
have like some kind of person at the at

7928.8 --> 7932.96
the entrance of the

7930.639 --> 7935.88
supermarket that people have to like

7932.96 --> 7938.679
answer questions to get in and you'd be

7935.88 --> 7938.679
able to prove

7940.159 --> 7945.44
it

7942.88 --> 7948.119
people that go into the organic

7945.44 --> 7951.678999999999
Supermarket they might have some like

7948.119 --> 7955.04
health issues here and there but none of

7951.679 --> 7957.679
them are just [ __ ] like none of them

7955.04 --> 7960.36
are they might not all be Geniuses but

7957.679 --> 7962.04
none of them are actually like numb and

7960.36 --> 7964.48
that kind of

7962.04 --> 7966.639
stuff well you go to a regular

7964.48 --> 7968.48
Supermarket which is like right across

7966.639 --> 7971.679
the street from the organic Supermarket

7968.48 --> 7974.558999999999
where I typically go to like half the

7971.679 --> 7974.559
people there are just

7976.04 --> 7981.44
zombies

7977.88 --> 7984.400000000001
like people there don't even look around

7981.44 --> 7987.199
at other people that's a big difference

7984.4 --> 7990.48
in the organic Supermarket everybody

7987.199 --> 7993.159
that's there is like aware of everybody

7990.48 --> 7994.759999999999
else like you look around you take a

7993.159 --> 7997.96
look like

7994.76 --> 8000.119000000001
oh this person that person do I

7997.96 --> 8003.36
recognize them how do they

8000.119 --> 8006.119
look what is their mood in a regular

8003.36 --> 8008.079
Supermarket nobody even does that

8006.119 --> 8010.48
everybody's just walking around like a

8008.079 --> 8010.48
[ __ ]

8013.32 --> 8018.119
robot or they just like go around just

8015.96 --> 8021.4
staring in their mobile just like

8018.119 --> 8021.4
outside it's

8023.079 --> 8028.199
terrible and the workers like they're

8025.679 --> 8031.4
all just being

8028.199 --> 8033.0
ignored workers don't get had

8031.4 --> 8035.32
conversations with the with the

8033.0 --> 8036.44
customers in regular supermarkets in the

8035.32 --> 8040.48
organic

8036.44 --> 8044.638999999999
supermarkets like yeah we talk to the

8040.48 --> 8047.5199999999995
workers there we say hello to them when

8044.639 --> 8050.32
we walk past

8047.52 --> 8051.599
them we have a little conversation with

8050.32 --> 8053.92
the

8051.599 --> 8056.52
cashier we have

8053.92 --> 8059.559
cashiers yeah we still have cashiers

8056.52 --> 8063.639
yeah we're we're not in

8059.559 --> 8067.0
some just got get your robot

8063.639 --> 8070.96
scanner yeah no we have cashiers we have

8067.0 --> 8073.32
conversations with them yeah how about

8070.96 --> 8078.159
that

8073.32 --> 8082.239
huh cuz people that eat organic aren't

8078.159 --> 8082.239
robots they're not brain

8084.4 --> 8090.5199999999995
dead beautiful women are definitely at

8087.119 --> 8095.44
the organic yeah the healthy ones the

8090.52 --> 8095.4400000000005
fertile ones Bluefield Evolution that's

8100.04 --> 8105.639
right and the what I love about it the

8103.44 --> 8109.119
most with the organic

8105.639 --> 8112.28
Supermarket is that everybody

8109.119 --> 8114.558999999999
respects food knowledge there not

8112.28 --> 8115.679
everybody's like a specialist so

8114.559 --> 8117.360000000001
sometimes you could just like tell

8115.679 --> 8118.679
something oh look about this and that

8117.36 --> 8121.159
did you know about

8118.679 --> 8123.599
this and they might know a whole bunch

8121.159 --> 8126.44
or they might not really know much about

8123.599 --> 8128.88
it but they'll be respectful about it

8126.44 --> 8130.919999999999
like oh that's interesting I didn't know

8128.88 --> 8135.559
that

8130.92 --> 8139.639
right like food knowledge alternative

8135.559 --> 8142.76
medical knowledge is held in high

8139.639 --> 8145.2390000000005
regard in the in the organic Supermarket

8157.719 --> 8163.8
decades CU I remember I've been now

8161.04 --> 8164.92

strict cashiers how exotic yeah

8179.92 --> 8182.92

okay I mean it it the Cashers aren't

8200.24 --> 8206.519
exactly like oh let's go sex dating or

8206.519 --> 8209.84
healthy

8226.04 --> 8230.639000000001
weather and I'm always very positive

8239.559 --> 8244.479
the weather no matter what it is

8242.23 --> 8247.439
[Music]

8244.479 --> 8247.438999999998
I'm one of those

8248.309 --> 8251.559
[Music]

8269.08 --> 8274.8
people hey that one guy I can see you oh

8272.559 --> 8280.08
you're

8274.8 --> 8283.08
very meaty dairy diet I

8280.08 --> 8283.08
see

8285.599 --> 8291.319
yeah but yeah I'm kind of the 90% is a

8289.359 --> 8294.399000000001
bit

8291.319 --> 8297.8
much for me it's kind of like 50/50 I

8294.399 --> 8300.559
don't eat a lot of fruits on

8297.8 --> 8303.8
average I do try to like eat some kind

8300.559 --> 8303.8
of vegetables every

8325.679 --> 8331.679
day oh you have to oh that's nice B boy

8328.76 --> 8334.439
yeah I like that

8331.679 --> 8336.479
that's like the oldfashioned food store

8334.439 --> 8338.92
where you just have to ask the person

8336.479 --> 8341.24
behind the counter to get it for you I

8338.92 --> 8341.24
love

8344.28 --> 8352.479000000001
those but I mean yeah a big Supermarket

8348.599 --> 8352.479
it it won't function like that

8359.719 --> 8364.259
though

8361.1 --> 8364.259
[Music]

8374.519 --> 8379.639000000001
picked up eating more red meat with the

8376.599 --> 8384.2
whole carnivore diet thing yeah it's

8379.639 --> 8384.199999999999
something I mean there is something to

8384.9 --> 8388.07
[Music]

8389.64 --> 8394.96
it

8392.04 --> 8397.960000000001
it's coming to that in the

8394.96 --> 8397.96
states

8403.52 --> 8410.68
what more tiny tiny food stores with

8408.16 --> 8412.8
people behind the counter is it coming

8410.68 --> 8416.08
to that I mean why

8412.8 --> 8418.039999999999
not that's the old mom and pop store

8416.08 --> 8422.08
style that's how it used to

8418.04 --> 8424.12
be and that way also the storekeeper

8422.08 --> 8426.8
will really know

8424.12 --> 8430.08
everything they will really know the

8426.8 --> 8430.08
products where they

8441.319 --> 8445.64
are okay borders boy good for

8449.64 --> 8452.64
you

8453.88 --> 8458.8
have to cut down on the amount of meat

8455.479 --> 8458.8
you eat

8460.16 --> 8466.16
okay well for me look I'm not going to

8463.52 --> 8469.2
get meat out of my diet I don't plan to

8466.16 --> 8473.119999999999
I ate vegetarian for a year a couple of

8469.2 --> 8477.16
years ago and that worked out great but

8473.12 --> 8481.240000000002
for me now it it seems to be typically a

8477.16 --> 8483.96
balance of I eat two days where I have

8481.24 --> 8487.52
meat during dinner like hamburgers or

8483.96 --> 8489.24
something then one day I don't I I kind

8487.52 --> 8491.479000000001
of keep it

8489.24 --> 8495.319
vegetarian I might still have liver

8491.479 --> 8498.679999999998
worst this at like the LA late dinner

8495.319 --> 8503.76
thing and then like so it's like two

8498.68 --> 8506.6
days with meat one day without meat at

8503.76 --> 8508.960000000001
dinner and then two days with meat one

8506.6 --> 8513.28
day without and that seems to be like a

8508.96 --> 8518.479
really good Balan rhythm for me how I do

8513.28 --> 8518.479000000001
it but like eating meat every single

8518.88 --> 8525.358999999999
day it might have some weird negative

8522.2 --> 8529.12
influence I can't really tell it's just

8525.359 --> 8532.479000000001
that I have two days with meat and then

8529.12 --> 8536.319000000001
the the then the following day I just I

8532.479 --> 8538.08
just don't want to I just like no I just

8536.319 --> 8540.72
want don't want

8538.08 --> 8542.92
it and then the next day I'm like oh oh

8540.72 --> 8544.319
yeah let's get back to meat it's I don't

8542.92 --> 8547.84
know that's just how it's working with

8544.319 --> 8549.76
me for some reason I don't know why but

8547.84 --> 8553.56
it feels

8549.76 --> 8556.0
good two days meet one day vegetarian

8553.56 --> 8558.8
two days meat one day vegetarian that

8556.0 --> 8558.8
works great for

8569.439 --> 8572.439

8706.88 --> 8710.519999999999
okay I got a title

8710.88 --> 8715.72
expansion since we're talking about food

8713.439 --> 8715.720000000001
so

8719.319 --> 8722.319
much

8729.2 --> 8734.92
I'm even trying to avoid the word

8731.399 --> 8734.92
medical for the

8736.399 --> 8741.72
title I mean I can still say like

8739.16 --> 8745.16
medical

8741.72 --> 8747.519999999999
experiment medical intervention but like

8745.16 --> 8751.16
even like I want to kind of try to avoid

8747.52 --> 8753.2
it even for the title to use the word

8751.16 --> 8754.76
medical so I'm just going to call it

8753.2 --> 8758.880000000001
allopathic

8754.76 --> 8761.56
intervention allopathic intervention

8758.88 --> 8763.88
troubles I think that's a a pretty good

8761.56 --> 8766.319
way to phrase it what we've been talking

8763.88 --> 8766.319
about

8767.319 --> 8770.92
today what do you guys

8779.24 --> 8782.24
think

8782.76 --> 8786.64
lavender lemonade

8788.68 --> 8796.319
huh I think I I've tasted that while

8792.92 --> 8797.8
back some person who was like really

8796.319 --> 8800.96
into

8797.8 --> 8803.92
flowery flower lemonade that was kind of

8800.96 --> 8805.919999999998
weird though not really my thing but

8803.92 --> 8809.24
interesting that it

8805.92 --> 8812.24
exists weird

8809.24 --> 8812.24
though

8817.2 --> 8821.439
I just like smelling it more than

8819.0 --> 8821.439
tasting

8821.56 --> 8826.08
it lots of food knowledge being shared

8824.0 --> 8829.96
today yeah yeah no I love that this part

8826.08 --> 8834.92
of the my main typical

8829.96 --> 8838.319
subject lavender powerful flavor yeah no

8834.92 --> 8840.88
I like the smell of lavender I love it

8838.319 --> 8845.359
especially like it's fresh flow lavender

8840.88 --> 8845.358999999999
that's that's great very

8847.52 --> 8852.84
soothing but yeah doesn't make me like

8850.6 --> 8855.439
oh give me

8852.84 --> 8859.92
that

8855.439 --> 8859.92

8938.479 --> 8944.599999999999
really they

8940.2 --> 8949.439
were people were stealing

8944.6 --> 8952.84
socks so they had to lock them up

8949.439 --> 8952.84

9004.439 --> 9010.12
don't sh at the ghetto

9007.8 --> 9012.56
Wallmart right yeah we don't really have

9010.12 --> 9015.0
like a a ghetto store like we don't have

9012.56 --> 9018.6
a ghetto here like even in

9015.0 --> 9022.12
utre I mean there might be areas that

9018.6 --> 9025.12
are like slightly more

9022.12 --> 9027.880000000001
trashy but overall it's it they've done

9025.12 --> 9031.68
a good job I think here in the

9027.88 --> 9035.88
city but I mean I I don't go to like the

9031.68 --> 9037.880000000001
nonorganic food supermarket for food

9035.88 --> 9040.56
even though they do have some organic

9037.88 --> 9044.278999999999
products like I don't care but I do go

9040.56 --> 9044.278999999999
there for toilet

9044.319 --> 9051.92
paper uh like

9047.92 --> 9051.92
drain cleaning agent

9054.8 --> 9060.72
uh trash

9057.16 --> 9060.72
bags that kind of

9063.8 --> 9068.679999999998
stuff and they got rid of all the

9066.12 --> 9070.84
cashiers I'm like what the [ __ ] is wrong

9068.68 --> 9070.84
with

9072.319 --> 9077.68
you like really you need to save costs

9075.68 --> 9081.92
on that

9077.68 --> 9081.92
[ __ ] that's just ridiculous

9094.52 --> 9101.16
and it's it's stupid too because

9097.319 --> 9104.319
like how does it work well there's

9101.16 --> 9108.119999999999
literally two or three people that

9104.319 --> 9111.319
basically stand around the the automated

9108.12 --> 9114.52
checkout area to check if everybody's

9111.319 --> 9117.519999999999
doing it and not secretly cheating so

9114.52 --> 9119.6
they end up having to have three guards

9117.52 --> 9125.84
instead of three

9119.6 --> 9125.84
Cashers like okay wow what an

9126.76 --> 9133.479
advantage I don't get it what's the

9130.04 --> 9133.479000000001
point how how is this saving

9138.84 --> 9141.84
money

9143.16 --> 9150.8
I mean I guess that the cashiers tend to

9146.84 --> 9153.04
have more rows of people but yet that

9150.8 --> 9155.96
didn't used to be a

9153.04 --> 9157.92
problem when there were still like four

9155.96 --> 9161.759999999998
or five

9157.92 --> 9163.64
lanes for different cashiers cashiers

9161.76 --> 9165.68
and then there wouldn't be a problem it

9163.64 --> 9168.84
wouldn't be that long you would wait

9165.68 --> 9170.84
like 30 seconds to a minute at

9168.84 --> 9173.92
best

9170.84 --> 9178.16
so it just seems so

9173.92 --> 9178.16
pointless like oh yeah you can walk

9180.2 --> 9184.08
immediately but it's super

9203.08 --> 9206.84
right anyway it's not really my problem

9205.0 --> 9209.359
because they didn't do it at the organic

9206.84 --> 9213.56
Supermarket it's just the regular ones

9209.359 --> 9213.56
that seems to have switched like

9219.6 --> 9227.319
that yes blue Evolution absolutely yes

9223.92 --> 9229.52
it is funny eating organic can end up

9227.319 --> 9231.6
eating cheaper because you can't become

9229.52 --> 9233.560000000001
more more selective about what you eat

9231.6 --> 9235.76
and you eat less CU there's more

9233.56 --> 9238.96
nutrition in the food you eat

9235.76 --> 9243.399
absolutely and I've lived through that

9238.96 --> 9243.399
pretty much half my life now it is so

9243.6 --> 9248.6
true you're

9245.76 --> 9253.0
less seduced

9248.6 --> 9256.960000000001
by just chemicals that that beg you to

9253.0 --> 9258.96
get more of them less candy even though

9256.96 --> 9260.88
there is organic candy and it is kind of

9258.96 --> 9263.039999999999
nice

9260.88 --> 9265.88
I'm just like yeah I'm very

9263.04 --> 9269.84
selective it's all become more

9265.88 --> 9273.399
expensive so I'm just way more careful

9269.84 --> 9276.8
with planning out what I get the amount

9273.399 --> 9280.76
that I get I don't have any leftovers

9276.8 --> 9286.119999999999
that end up getting thrown away yeah I

9280.76 --> 9291.0
see my roommates throwing away entire

9286.12 --> 9293.08
meals yeah and I'm like Mori by it like

9291.0 --> 9294.56
wow I can't believe you're just throwing

9293.08 --> 9298.52
all of that

9294.56 --> 9300.359
away or like oh it all got spoiled

9298.52 --> 9302.319000000001
like

9300.359 --> 9303.84
yeah

9302.319 --> 9306.519999999999
uh

9303.84 --> 9309.08
okay I can't believe you're just okay

9306.52 --> 9310.76
with that and just having to do that

9309.08 --> 9313.319
regularly that's

9310.76 --> 9315.439
ridiculous I'm not going to get angry at

9313.319 --> 9318.278999999999
them for it but it's just like kind of

9315.439 --> 9320.68
shocking to me like yeah I don't have

9318.279 --> 9323.439
that issue like I don't throw anything

9320.68 --> 9324.84
away I plan it out very carefully what I

9323.439 --> 9328.68
eat and when I eat

9324.84 --> 9330.439
it and it's like there's no

9328.68 --> 9332.399
waste I

9330.439 --> 9336.56
mean it

9332.399 --> 9339.439
costs if I'd like got some let's just

9336.56 --> 9343.278999999999
say the hamburgers and there's like two

9339.439 --> 9345.12
little patties per package of hamburgers

9343.279 --> 9347.560000000001
let's just say I ate one hamburger of it

9345.12 --> 9349.960000000001
and then like forgot the other one and

9347.56 --> 9351.56
then it got all gray and gross and it's

9349.96 --> 9353.399
like okay this is not good anymore I

9351.56 --> 9356.439
have to throw it

9353.399 --> 9360.278999999999
away that's literally like

9356.439 --> 9361.52
€3 that I'm throwing away then it's like

9360.279 --> 9364.279
uh

9361.52 --> 9366.800000000001
no no you're not going to let that

9364.279 --> 9369.359
happen like everything is way too

9366.8 --> 9374.039999999999
expensive to just be okay with throwing

9369.359 --> 9376.279
it away like when you get it you got to

9374.04 --> 9376.279
eat

9376.359 --> 9384.12
it there's no stocking up Giants amount

9379.439 --> 9384.12
of food unless you anticipate eating

9385.04 --> 9391.12
it so don't get all hamstery like don't

9388.84 --> 9395.92
just like oh I got little bit more money

9391.12 --> 9399.359
oh let's get all stuff with food like no

9395.92 --> 9399.359
because you're going to have to eat

9403.64 --> 9411.519999999999
it right so yes eating organic need less

9408.56 --> 9411.519999999999
it's more nutritious

9411.8 --> 9415.72
because it's more

9413.08 --> 9419.64
expensive you got to prioritize you

9415.72 --> 9422.438999999998
can't just like buy a lot of candy and

9419.64 --> 9423.68
cookies and other junk on the side

9422.439 --> 9427.399
because it's so

9423.68 --> 9430.0
cheap it's so bad for you

9427.399 --> 9431.72
anyway when you do that I mean even the

9430.0 --> 9435.08
organic

9431.72 --> 9437.199999999999
candy it's still not very good for you

9435.08 --> 9440.279
you know it's still candy it's not going

9437.2 --> 9441.68
to be like oh that's really healthy no

9440.279 --> 9444.479000000001
no it's still

9441.68 --> 9447.08
candy it's just not as terrible there's

9444.479 --> 9449.039999999999
no disgusting chemicals in in it that's

9447.08 --> 9453.319
going to like rewire your brain or

9449.04 --> 9456.2
anything but I mean yeah it's less

9453.319 --> 9458.84
disadvantageous but it's still not good

9456.2 --> 9462.6
so I just eat a lot more

9458.84 --> 9465.479
careful and it's just worth more the

9462.6 --> 9469.08
food actually feels now like this is

9465.479 --> 9470.56
really valuable my valuable valuable

9469.08 --> 9473.039999999999
dinner

9470.56 --> 9474.88
and like enjoying it so much every

9473.04 --> 9477.359
little bit every little crumb every

9474.88 --> 9480.479
little drop of sauce I eat it all I'm

9477.359 --> 9483.319
like this is valuable I'm consuming

9480.479 --> 9486.399
something valuable and it's better it's

9483.319 --> 9486.399
healthier and it's

9488.69 --> 9491.879

borders where they have like this stupid

9771.359 --> 9776.16
code word [ __ ] and

9773.399 --> 9778.72
like and they use these code words just

to like get in other places and just

9778.72 --> 9785.92
like arbitrarily use those code

9782.399 --> 9788.64
words because other streamers don't pick

9785.92 --> 9792.04
up on it because it just seems weird and

9788.64 --> 9794.0
pointless and random it's just their way

9792.04 --> 9797.52
to tell me

9794.0 --> 9800.319
like yeah you told us not to use that

9797.52 --> 9803.68
word that one time you ban somebody for

9800.319 --> 9806.84
saying that word so now we're going to

9803.68 --> 9810.08
keep using it as a code word all the

9806.84 --> 9813.08
time everywhere just to make it known

9810.08 --> 9817.399
hey we're those trolls

9813.08 --> 9820.359

9820.359 --> 9827.04
to talk about those things in other

9822.399 --> 9830.92
places that just makes you clinically

9827.04 --> 9834.12
[ __ ] other people see you as

9830.92 --> 9837.6
clinically [ __ ] for doing that

9834.12 --> 9840.160000000002
because it is clinically [ __ ] to do

9837.6 --> 9843.279
that it is completely pointless it

9840.16 --> 9846.08
doesn't mean anything to

9843.279 --> 9848.68
anybody yeah and I'm not going to be

9846.08 --> 9853.319
changed in my mood for having a

9848.68 --> 9856.439
clinically [ __ ] person try to jab me

9853.319 --> 9861.68

and move on and say much more

9876.52 --> 9883.399000000001
interesting things that will get the

9879.88 --> 9886.64
intention from other people around

instead of the stupid lame troll with

9886.64 --> 9890.88
their stupid code words that don't me to

9889.24 --> 9894.72

10219.479 --> 10224.0
or mostly until it's rainy and then it

10221.96 --> 10226.64
never

10224.0 --> 10228.319
stops then everything floods until it

10226.64 --> 10230.88
stops raining again and then it's just

10228.319 --> 10230.88
sunny

10321.04 --> 10325.960000000001
still early in the morning

10323.6 --> 10327.92
okay right but I mean yeah there's

10325.96 --> 10330.16
apparently a lot of rain that has

10327.92 --> 10331.8
recently started happening in California

10330.16 --> 10334.08
which normally isn't and there was this

10331.8 --> 10336.8
flood I heard on the

10334.08 --> 10339.439
news but I

10336.8 --> 10342.88
mean that's a thing with with California

10339.439 --> 10344.2
isn't it it's like always sunny and dry

10342.88 --> 10346.08
and

10344.2 --> 10348.68
then

10346.08 --> 10350.76
suddenly and it's kind of rare it just

10348.68 --> 10353.960000000001
switches around and then it just gets

10350.76 --> 10357.04
super torrential rains and like those

10353.96 --> 10359.358999999999
rains then fill up the

10357.04 --> 10362.12
aquafers and then it just stops again

10359.359 --> 10364.319
and then it's like sunny again for a

10362.12 --> 10366.439
very long time that's that's how I've

10364.319 --> 10368.96
heard it actually

10366.439 --> 10371.52
works in in that region

10368.96 --> 10374.319
it's like Sunny for a very long time and

10371.52 --> 10376.720000000001
then you get like this insane rain and

10374.319 --> 10378.92
floods and then it stops again and

10376.72 --> 10380.319
everything is all stocked up with water

10378.92 --> 10382.88
filled

10380.319 --> 10385.72
up and then it just gets Sunny for a

10382.88 --> 10385.72
very long time

10386.6 --> 10390.0
again like

10393.92 --> 10400.439
decades and you're just in a in

10396.6 --> 10400.439
basically in a wet in a wet

10427.439 --> 10430.439
period

10439.12 --> 10445.319000000001
just FL on top of the ground to lower

10442.52 --> 10448.479000000001
elevations yes but I mean

10445.319 --> 10449.8
there it's going to like eventually sit

10448.479 --> 10453.199999999999
in the

10449.8 --> 10456.08
aquaverse which will then horizontally

10453.2 --> 10459.68
spread out and fill the

10456.08 --> 10464.279
groundwater reservoirs

10459.68 --> 10464.279
unless it all just flows off into the

10476.56 --> 10483.8
ocean

10478.359 --> 10487.720000000001
what Evacuate the water to that's such a

10483.8 --> 10490.029999999999
waste why don't they just like make it

10487.72 --> 10492.64
go off to the

10490.03 --> 10494.960000000001
[Music]

10492.64 --> 10498.08
Lakes why don't they

10494.96 --> 10500.0
just Build It Up in reservoirs that's

10498.08 --> 10503.16
just stupid why the hell would you just

10500.0 --> 10503.16
throw it into the

10503.84 --> 10510.8
ocean stop drainage system

10508.04 --> 10513.399000000001
yeah I mean it's it's precious water you

10510.8 --> 10514.05
need that damn water don't just dump it

10513.399 --> 10517.109999999999
in the

10514.05 --> 10517.109999999999
[Music]

10517.319 --> 10520.319
ocean

10526.12 --> 10532.359
you should like pump it up into like

10528.68 --> 10532.359
water storage Towers or

10537.279 --> 10543.12
something reservoirs

10540.359 --> 10545.399000000001
right well that's a good thing you

10543.12 --> 10547.239000000001
definitely should have those there and

10545.399 --> 10550.239
use

10547.239 --> 10550.239
them

10577.239 --> 10580.239
oh

10598.68 --> 10604.16
all soil simply kind of yeah but blue

10602.56 --> 10607.519999999999
pill

10604.16 --> 10612.56
Evolution wouldn't could there be like a

10607.52 --> 10612.560000000001
solution into this couldn't you make

10612.76 --> 10622.2
like sounds weird perhaps reversed

10617.64 --> 10626.88
Wells like have like holes in the ground

10622.2 --> 10629.2
like pipes that like go really deep to

10626.88 --> 10632.8
basically bypass the hard

10629.2 --> 10635.76
soil so that like a drain the water

10632.8 --> 10640.16
could like bypass the hard soil and just

10635.76 --> 10640.16
go go straight down

10641.88 --> 10647.239
like special drains that basically

10644.16 --> 10647.239
bypass the hard

10653.439 --> 10660.16
soil I mean I'd say that normally trees

10657.6 --> 10662.399000000001
and their root systems would usually

10660.16 --> 10665.08
function like that because Roots

10662.399 --> 10668.199999999999
especially when it's dry there's going

10665.08 --> 10672.72
to be space for the water to go down the

10668.2 --> 10675.2
the trunk in past the roots to go past

10672.72 --> 10678.039999999999
it go straight into the ground right

10675.2 --> 10680.720000000001
well if there's no trees out there then

10678.04 --> 10684.52
you might have to like have like a big

10680.72 --> 10686.599999999999
tube that just goes down very deep so

10684.52 --> 10690.84
that the water can like go through the

10686.6 --> 10690.84
tube instead of just sliding

10695.6 --> 10701.6
past yeah exactly yeah no it's totally

10699.08 --> 10705.12
logic FL stage that it will just roll

10701.6 --> 10709.6
past it but if there's like two drains

10705.12 --> 10713.560000000001
as it were in the soil then the flood

10709.6 --> 10716.16
water will simply go into those like a

10713.56 --> 10720.399
drain and then well it's not going to

10716.16 --> 10723.039999999999
roll away so it can just sit there and

10720.399 --> 10726.358999999999
gradually get absorbed by the deeper

10723.04 --> 10726.359
ground that isn't as

10726.76 --> 10732.800000000001
hardened so that it'll actually absorb

10729.68 --> 10734.6
the rain better when it does fall it

10732.8 --> 10736.039999999999
with buckets at a time which it does

10734.6 --> 10738.720000000001
over

10736.04 --> 10740.720000000001
there I'm just thinking of a solution

10738.72 --> 10745.278999999999
here I'm just being an

10740.72 --> 10745.278999999999
ecologist trying to be an ecologist

10753.38 --> 10756.699999999999
[Music]

10757.04 --> 10760.04
here

10760.2 --> 10765.2
right if if the

10762.239 --> 10767.8
water when it comes down in buckets has

10765.2 --> 10771.52
trouble basically seeping into the

10767.8 --> 10774.64
ground and has a tendency to just roll

10771.52 --> 10777.560000000001
off well wouldn't it be a solution to

10774.64 --> 10780.519999999999
have just like drain spots specifically

10777.56 --> 10780.519999999999
for that sort of

10780.56 --> 10787.08
thing like a tube like a almost like a

10784.68 --> 10789.880000000001
drain pipe just like dug down really

10787.08 --> 10792.92
deep

10789.88 --> 10795.438999999998
with uh with a cap on it so that it

10792.92 --> 10799.319
doesn't just get filled up with

10795.439 --> 10804.2
sand and then if water comes by it can

10799.319 --> 10804.199999999999
literally just just go down it like a

10805.76 --> 10811.6
drain and fill up and then it can roll

10808.92 --> 10813.319
away and then it has the time to get

10811.6 --> 10815.960000000001
absorbed by the under layer and then

10813.319 --> 10818.278999999999
maybe it could even have a suction

10815.96 --> 10822.0
working right as it gets absorbed it

10818.279 --> 10823.960000000001
will pull down even more water locally

10822.0 --> 10827.04
so that it'll just get absorbed by the

10823.96 --> 10828.679999999998
ground much better when the rain starts

10827.04 --> 10831.439
pouring

10828.68 --> 10835.68
down I mean it's just an

10831.439 --> 10838.12
idea but it might work better than just

10835.68 --> 10840.720000000001
all that water just rolling off into the

10838.12 --> 10840.720000000001
ocean or

10845.399 --> 10851.278999999999
something or oh yeah flatter state or

10848.2 --> 10853.52
indeed you could have a whole water

10851.279 --> 10856.76
drainage system like that that goes

10853.52 --> 10861.560000000001
directly into an aquifer you could do

10856.76 --> 10864.56
that too something like that yeah I mean

10861.56 --> 10864.56
why wouldn't you do

10865.6 --> 10871.399000000001
that if water's such a rare valuable

10868.8 --> 10874.239
commodity in the

10871.399 --> 10876.92
region why wouldn't you just make sure

10874.239 --> 10879.92
you got the best out of it when it

10876.92 --> 10879.92
happens

10893.439 --> 10899.0
what really a big thing I have no idea

10896.8 --> 10902.039999999999
what that means that one

10899.0 --> 10904.439
guy the Netherlands associated with

10902.04 --> 10906.359
heavy tobacco

10904.439 --> 10910.239
use

10906.359 --> 10914.479000000001
uh well he heavy tobacco you I

10910.239 --> 10915.92
mean we used to be like liking smoking a

10914.479 --> 10920.16
lot I

10915.92 --> 10923.04
guess but I mean the Liberals have like

10920.16 --> 10925.08
really tried to extinguish that habit a

10923.04 --> 10929.12
lot and there's a lot of shaming

10925.08 --> 10932.039999999999
happening and the prices are going up

10929.12 --> 10935.960000000001
insanely all the

10932.04 --> 10938.080000000002
time so they're like just one tiny

10935.96 --> 10939.438999999998
little step away from just straight

10938.08 --> 10942.239
without making it

10939.439 --> 10945.359
illegal even though you can still just

10942.239 --> 10948.039999999999
make advertisement for alcohol out there

10945.359 --> 10950.479000000001
which is totally insane but tobacco is

10948.04 --> 10953.04
just one step away from being completely

10950.479 --> 10955.92
illegal at this

10953.04 --> 10958.720000000001
point but I don't know if we're really

10955.92 --> 10961.279
like a smokers if our people were

10958.72 --> 10962.399
typically smokers a lot of tobacco I

10961.279 --> 10966.720000000001
don't

10962.399 --> 10969.84
know I mean I don't think much more than

10966.72 --> 10969.84
any other

10972.52 --> 10981.52
country like for example I don't know if

10975.92 --> 10984.08
we smoke more than say Spain and Italy

10981.52 --> 10986.960000000001
and France used

10984.08 --> 10989.08
to I think that people in those Nations

10986.96 --> 10991.839999999998
on average tended to smoke a little bit

10989.08 --> 10993.92
more but I mean I might be wrong maybe

10991.84 --> 10996.72
the Dutch were like really fanatical

10993.92 --> 10996.72
when it CES to

10996.76 --> 10999.76
tobacco

11000.399 --> 11005.56
I do like my tobacco I do like

11007.64 --> 11014.278999999999
it you get horrible mouth cancer from SN

11011.359 --> 11014.279
I don't know about

11024.12 --> 11029.12
that yeah don't swallow

11026.56 --> 11032.68
it yeah I don't know about chewing

11029.12 --> 11035.319000000001
tobacco or snuff or any of

11032.68 --> 11040.239
that I'm not going

11035.319 --> 11043.76
to recommend that or anything or condone

11040.239 --> 11048.399
that look even when it comes to smoking

11043.76 --> 11053.04
like I'm just like just leave us alone

11048.399 --> 11056.479
man just stop stop the whining about

11053.04 --> 11058.439
smoking stop treating it like it's the

11056.479 --> 11061.358999999999
ultimate death

11058.439 --> 11062.68
cause or something like it's I'm so sick

11061.359 --> 11066.960000000001
of the

11062.68 --> 11070.04
slander and just the The Bullying of

11066.96 --> 11071.519999999999
smokers bullying against smoking that

11070.04 --> 11074.239000000001
that's what I'm sick

11071.52 --> 11076.68
of yeah I'm not saying it's like the

11074.239 --> 11078.199999999999
ultimate Remedy or anything even

11076.68 --> 11081.800000000001
remotely like

11078.2 --> 11084.279
that I don't know about snu and about

11081.8 --> 11086.319
like snuff tobacco and chewing tobacco I

11084.279 --> 11088.720000000001
don't know about that at all I don't

11086.319 --> 11089.68
know if that's good or bad is probably

11088.72 --> 11093.84
not

11089.68 --> 11097.0
great I'm just sick of all the whiny

11093.84 --> 11100.84
nonsense against smoking that's what I'm

11097.0 --> 11103.399
sick of just leave it alone man just

11100.84 --> 11106.960000000001
stop the over

11103.399 --> 11109.96
taxation stop trying to spread all this

11106.96 --> 11112.88
nonsense propaganda about how it oh

11109.96 --> 11116.8
everybody's going to die from L cancer

11112.88 --> 11119.64
[ __ ] absolute [ __ ] it's just not

11116.8 --> 11119.64
true

11121.04 --> 11126.720000000001
it isn't yeah I mean people in the

11124.76 --> 11128.960000000001
Netherlands all over the Western world

11126.72 --> 11133.72
have been smoking tobacco since the

11128.96 --> 11136.64
freaking renaissance man yeah and back

11133.72 --> 11140.16
then they didn't all die from lung

11136.64 --> 11142.439
cancer it's absolute

11140.16 --> 11145.119999999999
nonsense it's

11142.439 --> 11148.479000000001
nonsense and I'm sick of it I'm sick of

11145.12 --> 11151.68
hearing the nonsense medical propaganda

11148.479 --> 11154.278999999999
of how horrendous tobacco is for you

11151.68 --> 11154.279
it's just

11157.359 --> 11164.640000000001
[ __ ] yeah I think that the real

11160.72 --> 11167.72
dangers that actually caused potential

11164.64 --> 11171.399
cancer epidemics or whatever happened in

11167.72 --> 11173.358999999999
the 20th century when when big tobacco

11171.399 --> 11177.039999999999
started to use

11173.359 --> 11179.56
additives I'm blaming that I'm just

11177.04 --> 11179.560000000001
saying like

11180.319 --> 11186.6
that's when [ __ ] got

11183.439 --> 11188.960000000001
bad when equality went down when people

11186.6 --> 11191.2
did get sick from

11188.96 --> 11195.039999999999
it but I

11191.2 --> 11198.359
mean where is all the where's the record

11195.04 --> 11201.160000000002
of all the the lung cancer patients from

11198.359 --> 11203.76
the 19th century when smoking was still

11201.16 --> 11208.6
a fullon habit Across the Western world

11203.76 --> 11211.399
it's just nonsense guys it's [ __ ] it

11208.6 --> 11214.08
like every freaking man back then in the

11211.399 --> 11215.439
19th century was smoking it was all the

11214.08 --> 11219.12
rage

11215.439 --> 11223.800000000001
everywhere everywhere yeah they're not

11219.12 --> 11223.800000000001
all dying from lung cancer it's

11227.88 --> 11233.119999999999
nonsense there's no record of that it's

11236.52 --> 11239.52
nonsense

11249.0 --> 11257.439
wow yeah it

11252.319 --> 11257.439
just it's all projection though all of

11260.399 --> 11268.0
it oh my terrible teeth oh no oh it's so

11265.399 --> 11272.08
bad ah

11268.0 --> 11275.279
oh my God I'm so ashamed of my teeth I'm

11272.08 --> 11278.64
so ashamed of it oh my

11275.279 --> 11281.319000000001
God CU it looks so terrible oh no look

11278.64 --> 11283.239
at all the holes look at all the holes

11281.319 --> 11288.64
between my teeth oh

11283.239 --> 11291.16
no oh it's so terrible except it totally

11288.64 --> 11295.319
isn't

11291.16 --> 11299.439
so I bet that's mostly just

11295.319 --> 11299.439
projection yeah mostly

11302.88 --> 11309.438999999998
projection my brother smokes organic

11305.16 --> 11312.2
tobacco oh lucky I wish I had available

11309.439 --> 11315.04
availability of organic

11312.2 --> 11317.2
tobacco like American Spirit used to

11315.04 --> 11319.560000000001
have an organic

11317.2 --> 11321.92
variety but it's not available in the

11319.56 --> 11325.479
Netherlands and I'm like really pissed

11321.92 --> 11328.52
off like how [ __ ] dare you not have

11325.479 --> 11331.679999999998
that anymore like it's still exists they

11328.52 --> 11335.2
still make it why aren't we getting it

11331.68 --> 11335.2
like I'm genuinely

11336.319 --> 11342.84
angry I want that I want the organic one

11340.88 --> 11346.519999999999
why isn't that available here I'm

11342.84 --> 11346.52
outraged I'm genuinely

11351.16 --> 11355.84
outraged think coffee will stain your

11353.64 --> 11359.0
teeth worse than

11355.84 --> 11361.84
tobacco yes

11359.0 --> 11365.16
but also look I

11361.84 --> 11369.479
smoke using carbon

11365.16 --> 11372.8
filters o tubes to be precise from

11369.479 --> 11377.399
Germany it's a German

11372.8 --> 11381.599999999999
brand and this stuff literally takes out

11377.399 --> 11385.76
the tar out of the tobacco smoke a lot

11381.6 --> 11389.880000000001
most of it not 100% but most of it

11385.76 --> 11392.960000000001
and the tar is what really stains the

11389.88 --> 11395.16
teeth so much so since I've been using

11392.96 --> 11397.039999999999
these and I've been using these for now

11395.16 --> 11399.359
almost a

11397.04 --> 11402.560000000001
decade I don't get it anyway there's no

11399.359 --> 11404.880000000001
more stains here also I've noticed

11402.56 --> 11407.119999999999
coffee is known to stain in your teeth a

11404.88 --> 11409.399
little especially if you drink it all

11407.12 --> 11409.399000000001
the

11409.8 --> 11417.358999999999
time tea Brown

11413.6 --> 11420.08
tea actually turns out to be way worse

11417.359 --> 11422.399000000001
first for teeth

11420.08 --> 11426.6
coloration did you know did you know

11422.399 --> 11431.319
that brown tea actually turns out to be

11426.6 --> 11431.319
way worse for teeth coloration than

11431.6 --> 11437.92
coffee unless you like drink coffee all

11434.479 --> 11441.358999999999
day long and smoke without any filters

11437.92 --> 11443.0
then I'm sure it's going to be terrible

11441.359 --> 11445.16
don't do

11443.0 --> 11448.84
that but

11445.16 --> 11452.08
Tea Act yeah the brown tea it does

11448.84 --> 11455.279
actually like have

11452.08 --> 11457.52
palpably like a staining effect on your

11455.279 --> 11460.439
teeth it makes it generally more

11457.52 --> 11462.359
Brown and that's also harder to get rid

11460.439 --> 11465.359
of brushing your

11462.359 --> 11465.359
teeth

11466.52 --> 11470.880000000001
mouthwash I don't know I don't use

11471.479 --> 11478.16
mouthwash this is a weird chemical stuff

11475.04 --> 11480.720000000001
anyway I mean I just brush my teeth

11478.16 --> 11480.72
twice a

11481.08 --> 11486.56
day I use the carbon filters for

11484.399 --> 11489.84
smoking I don't

11486.56 --> 11492.8
drink Brown tea

11489.84 --> 11495.84
anymore and my teeth are doing great

11492.8 --> 11495.84
they're doing just

11506.239 --> 11509.239
fine

11511.84 --> 11520.439
wish I would have had that when I was

11516.2 --> 11522.880000000001
smok my Jones though yes flatter Sage I

11520.439 --> 11527.800000000001
mean that's what I originally used them

11522.88 --> 11530.839999999998
for I use the ones that I used for

11527.8 --> 11532.438999999998
joints than for regular cigarettes that

11530.84 --> 11536.2
you can roll with

11532.439 --> 11538.239
them but I used the fresh filters for a

11536.2 --> 11541.319000000001
joints and then after I use them one

11538.239 --> 11545.319
time I just put them in the secondary

11541.319 --> 11545.319
box that I use for

11546.6 --> 11553.52
cigarettes and they're really great like

11549.2 --> 11555.76
with cannabis smoking because they don't

11553.52 --> 11559.359
take out any of the taste or any of the

11555.76 --> 11562.64
influence of it it's great I mean it's a

11559.359 --> 11566.12
great invention this carbon granules

11562.64 --> 11569.119999999999
that are in there they really do a great

11566.12 --> 11569.12
job

11577.16 --> 11581.279
they take out what you want to be taken

11579.64 --> 11583.68
out and they don't take out what you

11581.279 --> 11586.76
don't want to be taken out that's my

11583.68 --> 11588.76
experience with them I'm very happy I'm

11586.76 --> 11593.16
like if I wouldn't have these I would

11588.76 --> 11593.16
quit smoking like I wouldn't do

11593.399 --> 11598.479
it like I'm not going to smoke without

11596.439 --> 11602.2
these filters anymore I just refuse to

11598.479 --> 11602.199999999999
do that I'm not going to do

11603.92 --> 11609.279
that like in a way I started using these

11606.8 --> 11613.278999999999
filters even though they're not super

11609.279 --> 11615.92
cheap okay but I mean it's my life

11613.279 --> 11618.359
insurance policy I'm pretty sure that if

11615.92 --> 11620.76
I'd be continuing smoking everything

11618.359 --> 11625.56
that I did without these types of

11620.76 --> 11625.56
filters I would probably get lung

11626.04 --> 11629.04
problems

11632.479 --> 11638.119999999999
but it's very

11635.399 --> 11641.199999999999
doable with since I've been using these

11638.12 --> 11644.359
filters my lungs have less

11641.2 --> 11647.6
issues than

11644.359 --> 11647.6
say what is

11650.12 --> 11656.279
it like n years

11652.6 --> 11659.399000000001
ago I kind of just started smoking again

11656.279 --> 11662.76
after Yeah I broke up with my ex didn't

11659.399 --> 11666.68
know about these filters yet and then

11662.76 --> 11669.72
like I smoked a year and it had it hurt

11666.68 --> 11670.92
it like hurt my lungs it hurt my throat

11669.72 --> 11674.84
I had

11670.92 --> 11676.92
like coughing issues all kinds of issues

11674.84 --> 11681.08
then I discovered these filters and it

11676.92 --> 11685.359
all just slowly went

11681.08 --> 11685.359
away and it never really came

11686.04 --> 11689.92
back so it really

11699.08 --> 11703.319
matters wow somebody's really

11703.439 --> 11712.6
desperate maybe it's another group of

11707.96 --> 11717.0
Dutch liberals that are just like really

11712.6 --> 11718.84
really scared really scared of smoking

11717.0 --> 11723.08
you think of somebody smokes in their

11718.84 --> 11726.279
vicinity they could acutely die quickly

11723.08 --> 11729.479
I was in the presence of of I I got a a

11726.279 --> 11733.800000000001
smoke cloud hit my face quickly get a

11729.479 --> 11737.198999999999
cancer test oh I have to get the latest

11733.8 --> 11739.72
medical experimentation now which isn't

11737.199 --> 11741.960000000001
going to cause actual cancer at all no

11739.72 --> 11745.119999999999
it's that one time I got hit with a

11741.96 --> 11747.0
smoke cloud from a tobacco smoker that's

11745.12 --> 11751.960000000001

[Music]

11909.479 --> 11917.76
yeah and hey don't smoke near little

11913.6 --> 11920.239
kids I'm totally with you yeah don't do

11917.76 --> 11922.279
that it's not nice it's not good for

11920.239 --> 11924.56
little kids to be around tobacco

11922.279 --> 11927.08
influence even like the positive

11924.56 --> 11930.6
influence it could somehow have it

11927.08 --> 11932.84
shouldn't be little near little children

11930.6 --> 11934.239
like pre-teens it's not good to have

11932.84 --> 11935.439
that kind of influence around you

11934.239 --> 11941.198999999999
shouldn't do

11935.439 --> 11941.199
that right but I mean that's about

11944.0 --> 11950.479
it like just don't smoke near little

11947.8 --> 11953.438999999998
children and that's it like that's as

11950.479 --> 11958.72
far as I go with it it's like

11953.439 --> 11958.720000000001
yeah just don't worry so much

11962.08 --> 11967.72
why not kids because they're

11964.8 --> 11971.88
little they're really young and

11967.72 --> 11974.88
fresh and tobacco has certain influences

11971.88 --> 11977.599999999999
on the brain and they shouldn't be in

11974.88 --> 11981.599999999999
their growth and development stage be

11977.6 --> 11984.319
subjected to that not like when they're

11981.6 --> 11986.319
teens and all that it's no

11984.319 --> 11987.519999999999
problem but not when they're really

11986.319 --> 11990.8
little

11987.52 --> 11993.04
cuz then they might indeed like get like

11990.8 --> 11994.84
a physical addiction to that later in

11993.04 --> 11998.080000000002
life or something it's not I wouldn't

11994.84 --> 12000.359
recommend it also definitely don't smoke

11998.08 --> 12004.08
when you're like pregnant or anything

12000.359 --> 12007.399000000001
like not near little kids not near

12004.08 --> 12012.56
pregnant women I'm with

12007.399 --> 12012.56
you yeah that there is a point

12014.04 --> 12020.92
there even though I think in general was

12017.04 --> 12025.6
a Ru of fist alcohol for mere little

12020.92 --> 12027.92
children and pregnant women is way way

12025.6 --> 12030.199
worse

12027.92 --> 12032.319
okay way

12030.199 --> 12035.560000000001
worse but

12032.319 --> 12039.68
still you shouldn't smoke around little

12035.56 --> 12039.68
children or pregnant women I

12045.64 --> 12049.479
agree and that's

12063.76 --> 12068.08
it yeah that's right flatter Sage

[Music]

12075.56 --> 12078.56
exactly

12083.319 --> 12089.319
so just like keep it on the safe side I

12086.72 --> 12092.88
mean tobacco does have an influence

12089.319 --> 12092.88
secondhand smoke is a

12093.8 --> 12099.198999999999
thing it's not nice toar oh you get oh

12097.199 --> 12101.52
you're going to get sick and die from it

12099.199 --> 12104.92
even from second hand smoke no I'm not

12101.52 --> 12107.04
buying into that kind of tobacco phobia

12104.92 --> 12110.68
but I mean it does have an influ uence

12107.04 --> 12113.68
it and so you shouldn't force that on

12110.68 --> 12119.16
anybody I

12113.68 --> 12119.16
agree just don't overblow it it's

12126.359 --> 12130.56
ridiculous eight-year-old smoking

12128.399 --> 12133.599999999999
cigarett is not a good look

12130.56 --> 12135.519999999999
yeah yeah that that immediately makes it

12133.6 --> 12138.52
look like it's a trashy

12135.52 --> 12138.52

[Music]

12145.27 --> 12148.429
[Music]

12149.359 --> 12155.439
it does happen though I mean my dad told

12152.96 --> 12157.96
me like when he was like a little kid he

12155.439 --> 12160.76
smoked when he was like

12157.96 --> 12163.319
10 secretly though

12160.76 --> 12165.319
secret like that was definitely not

12163.319 --> 12167.278999999999
allowed by his parents but they would do

12165.319 --> 12171.84
it in secret

12167.279 --> 12171.84
so it's like yeah that did

12173.319 --> 12179.88
happen I don't think it happens as much

12176.0 --> 12182.6
now but then again I mean kids under 10

12179.88 --> 12185.839999999998
now are like freaking

12182.6 --> 12190.279
babies like literally like babies

12185.84 --> 12190.279
compared to 30 years 40 years

12195.439 --> 12203.08
ago so they would be afraid to even

12200.0 --> 12204.399
touch a cigarette now if they're younger

12203.08 --> 12208.6
than 10 years

12204.399 --> 12211.96
old so just the whole mentality of kids

12208.6 --> 12211.960000000001
is dramatically

12213.239 --> 12218.64
changed in the

12215.56 --> 12221.92
last let's just say last half a century

12218.64 --> 12221.92

12225.439 --> 12228.439

12307.319 --> 12312.76
of the medical

12308.8 --> 12315.399
system using propaganda to try to

12312.76 --> 12317.6
program everybody into thinking about

12315.399 --> 12320.8
things in a different way I'm sick of

12317.6 --> 12324.12
the social engineering I'm done with it

12320.8 --> 12326.438999999998
[ __ ] your medical propaganda and if you

12324.12 --> 12331.279
buy into it then [ __ ]

12326.439 --> 12333.960000000001
you I'm sick of it I'm sick of the

12331.279 --> 12336.95
propaganda and I'm not playing along

12333.96 --> 12338.96
anymore I'm going to tell you how I see

12336.95 --> 12343.640000000001
[Music]

12338.96 --> 12347.039999999999
it yeah smoker rights

12343.64 --> 12348.56
party leave us alone leave the tobacco

12347.04 --> 12352.239000000001
smokers

12348.56 --> 12355.8
alone stop over taxing

12352.239 --> 12359.319
it stop propagandizing it like it's the

12355.8 --> 12361.64
worst poison ever it's

12359.319 --> 12366.119999999999
nonsense I'm sick of

12361.64 --> 12366.119999999999
it I'm not going to play along with it

12371.96 --> 12377.839999999998
anymore yeah there's a lot of good

12375.239 --> 12381.319
developments

12377.84 --> 12384.0
that help against the potential negative

12381.319 --> 12386.72
influences of smoking tobacco and I'm

12384.0 --> 12389.68
sharing them yeah carbon filters for

12386.72 --> 12393.88
smokers it works great that didn't exist

12389.68 --> 12393.880000000001
50 years ago it exists

12399.279 --> 12403.880000000001
now it's good it's way

12405.239 --> 12410.52
better

12407.6 --> 12412.76
right and just be careful as to like

12410.52 --> 12413.960000000001
what kind of tobacco you get there is

12412.76 --> 12417.16
some

12413.96 --> 12418.0
dirty tobacco out there that's cheap it

12417.16 --> 12422.399
has

12418.0 --> 12425.64
Saucy crap in it it's very unhealthy you

12422.399 --> 12428.96
want to get the cleanest possible

12425.64 --> 12432.039999999999
unworked on Tobacco I mean preferably

12428.96 --> 12434.358999999999
raw leaves directly from the

12432.04 --> 12436.319000000001
plantation just the raw leaves you have

12434.359 --> 12439.399000000001
to cut them up yourself you can even

12436.319 --> 12441.56
that way bypass a lot of Taxation

12439.399 --> 12445.239
because you're not

12441.56 --> 12446.72
buying tobacco product you're you're

12445.239 --> 12448.64
just buying the

12446.72 --> 12453.198999999999
leaves you

12448.64 --> 12455.76
can bypass a lot of taxes that

12453.199 --> 12458.84
way I want to kind of do that again but

12455.76 --> 12458.84
it requires a bit of

12463.239 --> 12470.84
investment right and so

12467.199 --> 12470.84
like it's not that

12476.239 --> 12484.0
bad I want smoking to

12480.12 --> 12488.359
be admissible again like to be doable

12484.0 --> 12491.52
again in in restaurants situations and

12488.359 --> 12494.84
and not just in the middle of

12491.52 --> 12498.16
everybody but at least have a smoker

12494.84 --> 12500.279
section or have a special room whereas

12498.16 --> 12502.039999999999
like in between you're eating you could

12500.279 --> 12504.279
like go to the smoker's room you're not

12502.04 --> 12506.76
forced outside of the restaurant in the

12504.279 --> 12509.319000000001
rain or whatever that you have a special

12506.76 --> 12510.880000000001
place where you could just have a smoke

12509.319 --> 12512.239
and maybe have a conversation with

12510.88 --> 12514.64
another person that's there that's

12512.239 --> 12517.84
having a smoke like we used

12514.64 --> 12521.0
to Smoker conversation it's a real

12517.84 --> 12524.239
little subculture like get it back it

12521.0 --> 12527.68
was a an awesome thing that smokers used

12524.239 --> 12531.0
to do that really created a bond between

12527.68 --> 12534.479000000001
smokers like

12531.0 --> 12538.68
just give it

12534.479 --> 12538.679999999998
back stop attacking

12539.12 --> 12547.279
smokers just be reasonable about

12543.68 --> 12549.439
it that's it that's all I really want

12547.279 --> 12552.640000000001
with

12549.439 --> 12555.64
that right and with that I'm going to
