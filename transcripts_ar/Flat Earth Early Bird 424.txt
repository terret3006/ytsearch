yeah let's not draw indeed

280.44 --> 298.09
so yeah yesterday again long day and

295.24 --> 305.16
second day without alcohol and today

298.09 --> 305.15999999999997
yeah I'm I like it I didn't miss it

310.789 --> 317.96
I feel good one odd thing that I have

315.949 --> 322.43
noticed also is that I don't know why

317.96 --> 324.94899999999996
but I haven't drank any alcohol and he

322.43 --> 327.169
apparently because of this also smoked a

324.949 --> 329.3
lot less

327.169 --> 340.58
that's unusual I didn't notice that

329.3 --> 342.559
before oooh 2010 that's good what's the

340.58 --> 347.68
story behind the medallion well I made

342.559 --> 356.899
it a long time ago I think in 2008

347.68 --> 363.589
yeah and it's pure silver and I have the

356.899 --> 366.49
Flower of Life and craved on it no no

363.589 --> 366.49
how well you can see

367.53 --> 375.09
but yeah yes you must be thirsty good

one

375.09 --> 377.98999999999995
Jorge Sanford

379.42 --> 382.559
[Music]

388.21 --> 391.84
hello and there's ace

396.03 --> 403.88
huh right yeah well it's kind of funny

401.64 --> 406.56
with me how it kind of forced its way in

403.88 --> 409.65
because I never really planned to stop

406.56 --> 412.08
drinking but then basically because of

409.65 --> 415.34999999999997
money issues I was kind of pressed into

412.08 --> 422.57
it wasn't happy about it to be fair but

415.35 --> 425.34000000000003
then right it turned out fine I think

422.57 --> 429.84
although it's just been three days so I

425.34 --> 433.26
don't know you know to be fair I have

429.84 --> 440.33
been drinking alcohol daily for a year

433.26 --> 440.33
so yeah we'll see

441.29 --> 446.1
sorry if I'm starting out a bit slow

443.91 --> 449.94
besides being elated I also just smoked

446.1 --> 453.36
my first job today and it was pretty

449.94 --> 460.83
heavy as I might have to put in a little

453.36 --> 465.81
much but anyway yeah yesterday I was

460.83 --> 473.65999999999997
very active and see Owen Benjamin was

465.81 --> 482.88
great no connection problems this time

473.66 --> 487.65000000000003
and let's see what else oh yeah

482.88 --> 490.84
yeah Randy had a very late night show

487.65 --> 493.45
chitchat an open panel and yeah that was

490.84 --> 494.22999999999996
really interesting I listened to it on

493.45 --> 495.58
the background

494.23 --> 499.81
I was kind of in the middle of playing

495.58 --> 502.41999999999996
games and eventually I joined up after

499.81 --> 505.81
like an hour and I didn't hang around

502.42 --> 507.82
for too long because eventually like gru

505.81 --> 509.56
have came in there and then eventually

507.82 --> 511.99
even more ballers and I just thought

509.56 --> 514.65
like no it's too late I'm not gonna sit

511.99 --> 517.84
through that level of [ __ ] now this is

514.65 --> 518.77
so I just dropped again what I was on

517.84 --> 522.52
there for a while

518.77 --> 531.1899999999999
and yeah after that I wasn't Chad and

522.52 --> 536.05
guess what happened not bringing up but

531.19 --> 539.62
yeah something very typical a certain

536.05 --> 544.9499999999999
group of people came in there I made a

539.62 --> 548.19
comment and then yeah those people

544.95 --> 553.72
proceeded to start whining to me and

548.19 --> 559.44
yeah declaring I'm a crybaby and all

553.72 --> 562.96
that yet complain how I keep basically

559.44 --> 566.11
addressing certain issues and tagging it

562.96 --> 571.83
with names to describe it and to make

566.11 --> 574.24
kind of fun of it but yeah you know I

571.83 --> 577.12
there's nothing more annoying than

574.24 --> 579.94
people who try to create safe spaces for

577.12 --> 582.49
somebody and then start to tell other

579.94 --> 584.07
people or just don't be negative but why

582.49 --> 588.04
are you being like this

584.07 --> 589.839
while we call you a crybaby and tell you

588.04 --> 591.25
you're completely useless and nobody

589.839 --> 597.0100000000001
cares about you and that kind of

591.25 --> 602.02
nonsense you know it's it is extremely

597.01 --> 606.16
aggravating to me and yeah I do what I

602.02 --> 608.38
do then afterward I had it since I was

606.16 --> 609.91
still in the sky panel that was created

608.38 --> 612.6
out of the call I had a bit of a

609.91 --> 612.6
conversation

614.22 --> 623.1700000000001
and the guy what's his name again and I

617.709 --> 627.55
keep forgetting yeah Brian

623.17 --> 629.29
he got it Bryden is a great guy he's on

627.55 --> 631.5999999999999
there with ran T's regular also on the

629.29 --> 635.29
fat debates and yeah he's a he has a

631.6 --> 643.269
pretty strong Scottish oh is it Scottish

635.29 --> 647.649
or Irish accent is it Irish Scottish I'm

643.269 --> 651.94
not sure I'd have to ask but yeah yeah

647.649 --> 654.19
it's a great guy and he was very

651.94 --> 660.22
comforting because he he realized that

654.19 --> 666.839
yeah I I felt unjustified Scottish right

660.22 --> 666.839
oh yeah this is so which one is it

667.529 --> 696.1
northern no I think it is more Irish but

685.75 --> 702.55
yeah great guy and yeah overall pretty

696.1 --> 705.4490000000001
fun Saturday Saturday's a Sunday what's

702.55 --> 709.889
Sunday what the hell my saying this is

705.449 --> 709.889
and I'm a bit fuzzy today

714.12 --> 724.019
oh I wait sleep I missed sleeping

718.35 --> 726.389
Warriors up loud hmm yeah I was away

724.019 --> 731.91
getting groceries because finally I got

726.389 --> 736.62
money and then yeah much needed from the

731.91 --> 738.12
from the PayPal so finally I could get

736.62 --> 740.329
it round and get things that I really

738.12 --> 740.329
needed

753.3 --> 757.949
I think I miss lift the veil yeah Oh

755.519 --> 760.259
Benjamin bit of ugly Jew but didn't

757.949 --> 770.1289999999999
really interact and then ran tease

760.259 --> 776.6700000000001
happens oh yeah also after show from

770.129 --> 779.16
Friday that second one you have glow

776.67 --> 783.569
Buster's but yeah I'm blocked there now

779.16 --> 788.04
so it's just like okay I I unsubscribe

783.569 --> 790.5889999999999
to it it's just you know listen for like

788.04 --> 797.5799999999999
two minutes and it's just the same old

790.589 --> 800.6590000000001
same old it's so tired so no but anyway

797.58 --> 800.659
[Music]

801.259 --> 808.86
Dell has been quietly lately really well

805.379 --> 810.869
I thought that a few days ago he had a

808.86 --> 819.509
live stream he has a live stream every

810.869 --> 821.73
now and then built and pop well why do

819.509 --> 830.49
you think I'm blocked over at globe

821.73 --> 834.66
Buster's I yeah I don't want to get all

830.49 --> 837.569
into that again but yeah I've been very

834.66 --> 839.04
elaborate about it why why am i blocked

837.569 --> 844.3689999999999
there well it's because there's a

839.04 --> 848.04
certain individual that just really

844.369 --> 853.23
doesn't like to be addressed in ways

848.04 --> 855.0889999999999
that are beyond just praise and love you

853.23 --> 860.5790000000001
know they don't like any form of

855.089 --> 866.269
criticism and once you go there that

860.579 --> 869.9699999999999
person is butthurt about it forever and

866.269 --> 871.769
yeah that's also the reason why a lot of

869.97 --> 876.029
people that deal with that person

871.769 --> 879.299
constantly are just trying to sweep away

876.029 --> 882.899
any type of dangerous before he gets all

879.299 --> 885.37
baby again starts crying yeah start

882.899 --> 889.3
whining complaining and

885.37 --> 890.59
going full gamet personal attack it does

889.3 --> 892.6899999999999
that every time and it's really

890.59 --> 895.6
aggravating and everybody's burned by it

892.69 --> 897.7900000000001
but they all just want it to stop so

895.6 --> 901.21
they can have the nice version of the

897.79 --> 904.8
person that yeah that just does this

901.21 --> 909.24
silly storytelling time and things he's

904.8 --> 912.88
just brilliant well he doesn't actually

909.24 --> 915.4
get into a lot of technical concerning

912.88 --> 918.88
scientific method and proving his

915.4 --> 923.62
concepts or being very clear about where

918.88 --> 927.54
he said what it is where he stands and

923.62 --> 930.75
what that means now he just wants to

927.54 --> 933.55
once the assert that because he sees

930.75 --> 936.94
certain correlations and structures that

933.55 --> 941.4599999999999
yeah conceptual things must be real that

936.94 --> 945.0400000000001
thing and hey I used to kind of do that

941.46 --> 948.34
most part of my life up until roughly

945.04 --> 953.5899999999999
two years ago when it really became

948.34 --> 958.1800000000001
clear yeah how that that looseness of

953.59 --> 961.63
approach that and that break cognitive

958.18 --> 963.8499999999999
dissonance break from physical reality

961.63 --> 966.43
from from the scientific method and how

963.85 --> 968.6800000000001
that has influenced mmm everyone and

966.43 --> 973.27
that is the culture forwarded in school

968.68 --> 975.9699999999999
and on the TV and in fiction and yeah so

973.27 --> 980.11
everybody got used to that stepping away

975.97 --> 982.9300000000001
from what it really is and I got the

980.11 --> 986.1
significance of that but yeah there's

982.93 --> 986.0999999999999
plenty of people that don't

989.56 --> 997.329
they just don't and they make a lot of

992.86 --> 1000.029
mistakes also you know calling gravity a

997.329 --> 1002.87
force for example it's just dumb you

1000.029 --> 1005.519
know gravity is an effect if you wanna

1002.87 --> 1008.579
put it all together I thought about it

1005.519 --> 1011.55
you know if you wanna kind of presuppose

1008.579 --> 1015.18
gravity in a sensible way that is not

1011.55 --> 1017.7299999999999
heliocentric necessarily then you could

1015.18 --> 1020.449
say okay well gravity is just simply not

1017.73 --> 1026.579
a force it's an effect and that effect

1020.449 --> 1029.579
is basically yeah is a side effect for

1026.579 --> 1032.76
from relative density it is the setting

1029.579 --> 1036.329
that sets the polarization of the

1032.76 --> 1039.27
directions and it is an effect and that

1036.329 --> 1041.9089999999999
effect could be called gravity and could

1039.27 --> 1045.809
be imagined structurally like for

1041.909 --> 1047.49
example a field and in detectable field

1045.809 --> 1051.09
of force disequilibrium that is

1047.49 --> 1054.929
ever-present causing this division

1051.09 --> 1056.6399999999999
causing relative density but yeah you

1054.929 --> 1058.98
can't prove it because it cannot be

1056.64 --> 1062.039
changed so it's it's basically an

1058.98 --> 1064.59
aberration that that's it and yeah

1062.039 --> 1066.96
there's some people that just don't want

1064.59 --> 1068.1589999999999
to hear that they really don't and it's

1066.96 --> 1070.559
kind of difficult you know it's

1068.159 --> 1072.3300000000002
difficult they really don't want to hear

1070.559 --> 1075.99
it or maybe they don't want to hear it

1072.33 --> 1078.059
because I say it may be that I believe

1075.99 --> 1081.99
there's people out there that just don't

1078.059 --> 1086.789
want to listen to what I say not because

1081.99 --> 1089.52
it's not correct but because I say it

1086.789 --> 1092.61
and they just can't stand me they just

1089.52 --> 1094.8899999999999
get an a I get that I've even said past

1092.61 --> 1098.01
like I have I tend to have a polarized

1094.89 --> 1100.47
effect on people some people get it they

1098.01 --> 1103.919
connect and they appreciate it and they

1100.47 --> 1106.6490000000001
take the of the bit yeah I know I have

1103.919 --> 1109.409
sometimes a bit annoying sides I get it

1106.649 --> 1112.2299999999998
I find myself in a way sometimes but

1109.409 --> 1115.679
that's acceptable if you understand the

1112.23 --> 1118.02
bigger picture the and the integrity of

1115.679 --> 1120.3600000000001
the structures that I deal with

1118.02 --> 1121.92
how important that is to me the

1120.36 --> 1124.83
integrity of them in that it's real that

1121.92 --> 1129.63
that I keep concept from reality very

1124.83 --> 1131.1299999999999
distinctly apart and yeah if you don't

1129.63 --> 1133.8300000000002
get that if you don't see it if you

1131.13 --> 1137.13
don't connect then that annoying sight

1133.83 --> 1139.6789999999999
is just gonna dominate and so I'm just

1137.13 --> 1142.2
gonna be a really annoying guy that you

1139.679 --> 1145.679
just can't bear to listen to that makes

1142.2 --> 1151.98
no sense to you because she can't really

1145.679 --> 1155.7
listen to me you see so I I think I get

1151.98 --> 1164.94
why by the polarized effect I have on

1155.7 --> 1169.04
people what do you mean with that

1164.94 --> 1169.04
Ian Adams what is just my opinion

1190.58 --> 1198.6799999999998
Wow okay

1196.55 --> 1201.5
I get why you signed them out my core

1198.68 --> 1204.98
orc but that was so overtly ball

1201.5 --> 1207.26
triggering that I don't know you could

1204.98 --> 1212.83
have just let it in there because it's

1207.26 --> 1219.2
it's like hilarious it's so overtly

1212.83 --> 1225.35
gamma big mark Marshall said because you

1219.2 --> 1227.27
chat [ __ ] and all always always wrong I

1225.35 --> 1230.3899999999999
don't even know what that what type of

1227.27 --> 1232.91
English that is you block peeps when

1230.39 --> 1234.92
they talk the truth and you don't like

1232.91 --> 1241.0700000000002
it earth is round

1234.92 --> 1253.5500000000002
smiley just look at yourself man look at

1241.07 --> 1255.47
what you put there oh my opinion about

1253.55 --> 1261.01
gravity oh really

1255.47 --> 1263.39
so can you give a better alternative

1261.01 --> 1266.87
explanation for it that is actually

1263.39 --> 1272.39
crowded in technical reality based on

1266.87 --> 1275.6299999999999
scientific method what is it what is

1272.39 --> 1282.6100000000001
gravity according to you that you think

1275.63 --> 1282.6100000000001
it's my opinion you know

1283.12 --> 1288.55
look as as long as something is not

1286.0 --> 1291.4
proven or it seems very likely or

1288.55 --> 1294.82
unlikely to be proven because it's

1291.4 --> 1299.2900000000002
intangible you know you can point at it

1294.82 --> 1305.1699999999998
scientifically doesn't it's not it's not

1299.29 --> 1309.25
substantial then yeah you it's a concept

1305.17 --> 1311.8600000000001
and it stays a concept and I have kind

1309.25 --> 1313.24
of tagged that you could call that an

1311.86 --> 1316.2099999999998
opinion but it's kind of like a

1313.24 --> 1319.72
designation I figured out okay that type

1316.21 --> 1321.79
of concept that is very appealing but

1319.72 --> 1325.57
can never be proven yet tied in with all

1321.79 --> 1329.2
these different factors that could be

1325.57 --> 1331.75
like it's like a ghost but since a ghost

1329.2 --> 1334.03
or that kind of thing yeah that makes it

1331.75 --> 1335.62
points that are very different I wanted

1334.03 --> 1338.83
to keep it more technical so I'm calling

1335.62 --> 1344.4699999999998
it an aberration because an aberration

1338.83 --> 1346.6599999999999
is not an entity it's more like

1344.47 --> 1350.1100000000001
something that could be interpreted as

1346.66 --> 1353.41
an entity and also in the technical

1350.11 --> 1356.53
sense it is like a distortion that that

1353.41 --> 1362.1100000000001
confuses something there's something not

1356.53 --> 1367.06
right about it and it's unusual like the

1362.11 --> 1369.49
cohesiveness in this case is unusual it

1367.06 --> 1372.73
is about gravity it is very unusual how

1369.49 --> 1380.26
cohesive the concept is yet not provable

1372.73 --> 1382.89
and so I call it an aberration I'm just

1380.26 --> 1386.8
trying to refine the technical

1382.89 --> 1390.5200000000002
explanation for the type of concept that

1386.8 --> 1393.48
it is you know because there's concepts

1390.52 --> 1393.48
and there's concepts

1399.68 --> 1402.809
[Music]

1435.22 --> 1439.77
yeah Tom Parker why are you bring that

1437.71 --> 1439.77
up

1445.94 --> 1453.74
you know the way you say it it seems

1448.69 --> 1455.69
like you're too ridiculing it so am I

1453.74 --> 1460.42
getting that correct or did you choose

1455.69 --> 1460.42
to just keep it open

1471.46 --> 1482.92
yeah what what do you think you know

1476.58 --> 1485.6399999999999
certain certain being in dream yeah why

1482.92 --> 1485.64
did you bring that up

1492.24 --> 1498.48
now you have no clue you have no clue

1496.89 --> 1505.41
why you brought that up really you just

1498.48 --> 1507.99
said something random right because now

1505.41 --> 1512.0
Bates 60 RMC brings it up but he

1507.99 --> 1516.06
actually brings it up in a well in

1512.0 --> 1522.6
sizably in a context that can be

1516.06 --> 1524.52
perceived as positive you didn't but I

1522.6 --> 1528.74
don't know that could be my interpreter

1524.52 --> 1542.36
oh you're lost you're lost okay right

1528.74 --> 1545.46
I'll remind you in chat right here that

1542.36 --> 1549.6
can you read that because I'm not saying

1545.46 --> 1552.0
it you know I choose not to get that

1549.6 --> 1554.1899999999998
little tag I don't want to drag that

1552.0 --> 1555.63
subject into things unless I'm actually

1554.19 --> 1561.3600000000001
gonna talk about it and they're down

1555.63 --> 1566.48
what I wasn't planning to all right so

1561.36 --> 1570.9599999999998
you you were trying to ridicule me then

1566.48 --> 1572.46
because you think it's silly you think

1570.96 --> 1575.07
it's silly that I could think that

1572.46 --> 1578.28
certain entities could be real because I

1575.07 --> 1584.58
have oh okay

1578.28 --> 1587.16
goodbye right yeah goodbye Tom Parker I

1584.58 --> 1589.59
knew you were a piece of [ __ ] I knew it

1587.16 --> 1594.0
you've been off and on with your

1589.59 --> 1596.72
behavior you're terrible and you're out

1594.0 --> 1596.72
of here band

1601.66 --> 1604.989
[Music]

1608.059 --> 1614.19
yeah it's a sensitive subject tiny

1611.159 --> 1617.88
womble you know that because every it is

1614.19 --> 1621.179
like Flat Earth yeah it has that same

1617.88 --> 1624.1200000000001
type of impact on people so if you wring

1621.179 --> 1627.3300000000002
it on the table its it is kind of like

1624.12 --> 1629.549
going to a Star Wars convention

1627.33 --> 1632.97
right and then certainly starting to

1629.549 --> 1635.7
vividly loudly talk about flat earth and

1632.97 --> 1638.25
how space is fake yeah it's gonna get

1635.7 --> 1639.69
people really upset and pissed off so if

1638.25 --> 1642.09
you're just suddenly gonna bring that up

1639.69 --> 1643.279
without it actually being on the table

1642.09 --> 1647.9399999999998
already

1643.279 --> 1650.7
then you're literally just creating

1647.94 --> 1653.97
havoc bringing that up anyone who brings

1650.7 --> 1656.3700000000001
that up without the purse without asking

1653.97 --> 1660.299
a serious like for example over at Karen

1656.37 --> 1662.309
B's you know if she's talking about that

1660.299 --> 1664.23
yeah of course you you're you're

1662.309 --> 1666.69
supposed to you can talk about it you

1664.23 --> 1669.63
can ask questions but if it's not the

1666.69 --> 1672.5700000000002
subject then if you're constantly gonna

1669.63 --> 1677.69
put that in it's gonna distract everyone

1672.57 --> 1680.399
severely so it's not good to do that

1677.69 --> 1685.679
that's why and anyone that brings it up

1680.399 --> 1687.12
without being distinctly and yeah making

1685.679 --> 1690.179
sure that it's not going to be

1687.12 --> 1692.2199999999998
interpreted in a negative way and and

1690.179 --> 1696.26
trigger people to start ridiculing that

1692.22 --> 1699.69
because that's what happens with it then

1696.26 --> 1702.169
yeah you become suspects it's very

1699.69 --> 1702.169
simple

1707.19 --> 1710.249
[Music]

1712.269 --> 1716.69
now I don't ban people for their names

1714.979 --> 1723.769
unless they're their names are like

1716.69 --> 1729.71
overtly perverse i ban people for their

1723.769 --> 1732.049
behavior and well not just for the river

1729.71 --> 1734.8990000000001
i'll most yeah I point them at the

1732.049 --> 1739.34
behavior and if they don't adapt then

1734.899 --> 1741.6789999999999
I'll start pushing them away because

1739.34 --> 1744.139
yeah just certain types of behavior I

1741.679 --> 1746.8590000000002
just don't I don't want that here I

1744.139 --> 1750.049
don't want that to be part of my show I

1746.859 --> 1752.869
yeah because I get caught up in it and I

1750.049 --> 1754.849
have to actively force it away

1752.869 --> 1756.8999999999999
because I don't want to get caught up

1754.849 --> 1760.079
and it just distracts

1756.9 --> 1760.0790000000002
[Music]

1765.75 --> 1770.07
Yeah right baits are 60 RMC yeah I

1768.33 --> 1773.21
haven't looked into it but I have heard

1770.07 --> 1778.29
I've been pointed at several

1773.21 --> 1780.63
documentaries and I bet yeah I may look

1778.29 --> 1785.1299999999999
into that and not I'm not in the mood

1780.63 --> 1789.5400000000002
right now but yeah it is a developing

1785.13 --> 1792.3000000000002
thing and yeah I am very convinced about

1789.54 --> 1798.35
it also through vision experiences just

1792.3 --> 1801.12
yeah I have no problem believing it and

1798.35 --> 1804.99
it's very in it's just conceptually

1801.12 --> 1808.83
interesting and yeah I find it extremely

1804.99 --> 1811.73
appealing in many ways and just the

1808.83 --> 1815.1
mythology the mythology potential is

1811.73 --> 1818.42
extreme and that's why I think that

1815.1 --> 1822.84
because they're there they've probably

1818.42 --> 1826.77
influenced a lot of mythology concepts

1822.84 --> 1829.6799999999998
even in ways not saying that all

1826.77 --> 1832.58
mythologies are all fake but there may

1829.68 --> 1835.94
have been elements added to it and

1832.58 --> 1838.98
structure eyes you know restructure eyes

1835.94 --> 1843.03
inspired partially with this with what

1838.98 --> 1846.14
they do so yeah but anyway yeah not

1843.03 --> 1846.1399999999999
getting into the subject

1850.36 --> 1862.77
right Wow 30 minutes already

1870.25 --> 1876.879
while by the way did you see did anyone

1873.309 --> 1881.83
watch Owen Benjamin man he brought up

1876.879 --> 1885.1789999999999
this clip somebody made that's just so

1881.83 --> 1893.83
mind-blowing it's like beyond bizarre

1885.179 --> 1897.46
this is yeah so somebody basically what

1893.83 --> 1900.49
they did was open up a window with all

1897.46 --> 1903.1290000000001
the tweets of President Trump on a

1900.49 --> 1905.71
certain day and responses to them like

1903.129 --> 1907.6899999999998
hey opened them up and then scroll

1905.71 --> 1912.6100000000001
through it and as they scroll through it

1907.69 --> 1914.95
played a very specific song and it's

1912.61 --> 1916.779
just yeah you could literally did

1914.95 --> 1919.8700000000001
nothing wasn't even highlighted in the

1916.779 --> 1923.11
text no you could literally read every

1919.87 --> 1925.2689999999998
sentence that was sung in what Trump

1923.11 --> 1928.059
tweeted and how everybody responded to

1925.269 --> 1931.379
that like oh it makes no sense that he

1928.059 --> 1936.22
said this at just like oh my god like

1931.379 --> 1939.6899999999998
Trump just played with the medium and he

1936.22 --> 1942.94
basically made a tweet storm based

1939.69 --> 1946.1490000000001
purely around the text of that song it

1942.94 --> 1947.8600000000001
is just incredible now yet the bike

1946.149 --> 1950.5
thief that was the other one dad that

1947.86 --> 1952.9799999999998
was also that was very arty that that

1950.5 --> 1955.059
was freaking hilarious it was amazing

1952.98 --> 1956.8600000000001
but that's not the one that I was

1955.059 --> 1960.519
talking about I was talking about the

1956.86 --> 1964.9289999999999
the Trump tweet storm song thing that

1960.519 --> 1969.299
was awesome yet the bike thief that that

1964.929 --> 1974.0800000000002
was very very creative like fully drawn

1969.299 --> 1983.47
thing yeah that was funny like an

1974.08 --> 1986.649
arthouse video well mozzarella smith

1983.47 --> 1991.09
yeah in a way he does and in a way Trump

1986.649 --> 1996.809
is a rock star that's that's what he's

1991.09 --> 1996.809
been yeah it's just not with music

2001.63 --> 2011.66
yes that was yesterday's show I think

2009.59 --> 2015.1599999999999
was it the day before I don't know I

2011.66 --> 2018.3200000000002
think it was yesterday yeah I think

2015.16 --> 2021.2900000000002
Saturday that's when he first showed it

2018.32 --> 2023.81
a couple of times and this time he

2021.29 --> 2026.1399999999999
showed it just once to reference back to

2023.81 --> 2026.1399999999999
it

2041.89 --> 2050.639
what are you talking about what Cyril is

2044.32 --> 2050.639
amazing that that's

2056.02 --> 2066.77
but look it Trump is he's just not yeah

2062.839 --> 2069.2599999999998
he does things he plays games and it's

2066.77 --> 2071.149
really interesting to see and to figure

2069.26 --> 2075.9190000000003
out what games he's actually playing

2071.149 --> 2079.0389999999998
with it because yeah in a way it's very

2075.919 --> 2082.399
obvious that he is just filling a role

2079.039 --> 2085.119
and he doesn't have a lot of flexibility

2082.399 --> 2090.44
really even though yeah he is still

2085.119 --> 2092.329
exercising a lot for somebody in that

2090.44 --> 2095.059
role and doing it still pretty decently

2092.329 --> 2096.889
but yeah because of the lack of

2095.059 --> 2100.4
flexibility he's also just playing

2096.889 --> 2102.799
around almost like out of boredom I

2100.4 --> 2109.339
totally get that it's what I would do

2102.799 --> 2115.5099999999998
Rob Lee if I were in that position you

2109.339 --> 2115.5099999999998
know so I don't know

2118.05 --> 2127.1000000000004
look you could consider that Trump was

2121.74 --> 2132.33
never able to fully do what his campaign

2127.1 --> 2135.24
originally was presenting because of the

2132.33 --> 2137.4
consequences of being a president and

2135.24 --> 2138.9599999999996
the extreme limitations of it and the

2137.4 --> 2143.25
cabinet and the people he has to deal

2138.96 --> 2145.44
with so it was basically never yeah you

2143.25 --> 2149.46
might have wanted that but it's just not

2145.44 --> 2155.52
doable in the current setup never really

2149.46 --> 2157.05
was so it's it's all a matter of

2155.52 --> 2157.53
approach it doesn't mean that he doesn't

2157.05 --> 2159.8100000000004
want that

2157.53 --> 2165.48
although yeah turns out that he also

2159.81 --> 2169.38
wants some other weird things so it's

2165.48 --> 2175.14
like his open kind of alliance with

2169.38 --> 2179.1
Israel and all those plans although yeah

2175.14 --> 2184.95
it's just not he seems to be going with

2179.1 --> 2190.29
that but on the other hand he's also

2184.95 --> 2193.89
very I think he personally prefers peace

2190.29 --> 2197.46
and to use force to achieve peace even

2193.89 --> 2199.74
though that's very risky I think that is

2197.46 --> 2202.4700000000003
what he wants he doesn't want escalation

2199.74 --> 2205.8599999999997
he doesn't really want that he wants

2202.47 --> 2207.8399999999997
people to be riled up baby get it he

2205.86 --> 2210.36
wants likes to poke but he doesn't want

2207.84 --> 2212.79
things to go out of control because yeah

2210.36 --> 2214.56
poking around and doing all that it keep

2212.79 --> 2217.4
gets things rolling and that's good for

2214.56 --> 2221.73
business and that is something that he

2217.4 --> 2224.4900000000002
focuses on a lot so his always fooling

2221.73 --> 2226.5
around with that but he doesn't want

2224.49 --> 2230.16
things to escalate because yeah when a

2226.5 --> 2233.28
real war happens that's when when yeah

2230.16 --> 2236.16
free business basically ends so that's

2233.28 --> 2239.52
that's when he when he personally fails

2236.16 --> 2242.67
so he doesn't want that that's what I

2239.52 --> 2244.65
think it doesn't want things to go out

2242.67 --> 2247.919
of control

2244.65 --> 2247.919
[Music]

2248.48 --> 2253.53
even though yeah sometimes the way he

2251.22 --> 2255.45
communicates it does definitely seem

2253.53 --> 2258.03
like he wants it to go out of control

2255.45 --> 2261.12
but again it's more like pushing people

2258.03 --> 2262.92
around getting riled up getting people

2261.12 --> 2265.08
at you that getting people focused on

2262.92 --> 2268.59
him and wasting all their time and

2265.08 --> 2271.95
energy yeah responding to him and

2268.59 --> 2275.7000000000003
instead of working on their own things

2271.95 --> 2280.71
so in a way what he does then is also

2275.7 --> 2283.29
it's like a psychological strategy from

2280.71 --> 2287.96
the office it's an office strategy I

2283.29 --> 2287.96
think anyway

2288.99 --> 2291.89
right

2304.64 --> 2310.16
Trump trolls to clean out the swamp yeah

2308.06 --> 2312.41
he does that and that's always fun

2310.16 --> 2315.56
you know especially like during the

2312.41 --> 2317.33
election days that was so good when it

2315.56 --> 2321.02
was all clean that's beautiful everybody

2317.33 --> 2324.92
was just I was lad like laughing my my

2321.02 --> 2328.13
head off was just ecstatic times to

2324.92 --> 2333.86
hearing him say that [ __ ] and a lot of

2328.13 --> 2343.88
people were yeah it was the libertarian

2333.86 --> 2347.33
Obama moment in a way was amazing but

2343.88 --> 2351.4700000000003
yeah it's not going to go as fast as as

2347.33 --> 2353.6
we all originally thought and yeah Trump

2351.47 --> 2357.1099999999997
does make some very odd choices and

2353.6 --> 2361.72
seems to like roll into the swamp every

2357.11 --> 2361.7200000000003
now and then for no apparent good reason

2361.78 --> 2369.32
because Trump likes to get around I

2365.02 --> 2371.54
think not for any perverted state but he

2369.32 --> 2373.88
just likes to be in contact with a lot

2371.54 --> 2375.02
of people I think I don't know I don't

2373.88 --> 2377.9
know I don't know him that well

2375.02 --> 2379.4
personally I don't know it's just that

2377.9 --> 2381.4700000000003
it's the what the feel did the

2379.4 --> 2385.9700000000003
preliminary feel anyway I'm just now

2381.47 --> 2393.1299999999997
basically mystic Megan it's yes Nathan

2385.97 --> 2393.1299999999997
would say but yeah

2394.43 --> 2400.069
for yeah when it comes to if I'd size it

2397.789 --> 2403.88
up the situation I like to do that I

2400.069 --> 2407.69
guess with Trump is still it's still

2403.88 --> 2409.94
good it's still good enough to me you

2407.69 --> 2412.4500000000003
know could be worse could be a lot worse

2409.94 --> 2417.829
but it could just in general be worse

2412.45 --> 2420.5589999999997
don't underestimate how easily corrupted

2417.829 --> 2423.049
so many other politicians are in the

2420.559 --> 2425.059
face of orders from the Beast from the

2423.049 --> 2428.45
machine to get things done no matter the

2425.059 --> 2430.849
cost a lot of politicians roll over

2428.45 --> 2438.069
extremely easily Trump doesn't do that

2430.849 --> 2438.069
but he does have odd strategies so

2441.82 --> 2449.51
[Music]

2454.27 --> 2457.27
Wow

2458.33 --> 2461.74
it's almost three o'clock

2467.18 --> 2475.25
all right well Bates 60 RMC you are

2470.18 --> 2480.02
pretty much correct what is presented is

2475.25 --> 2483.65
a state show what we see on TV the the

2480.02 --> 2486.34
debates that the announcement that's all

2483.65 --> 2490.31
a state show quite literally it is

2486.34 --> 2493.58
completely scripted or mostly scripted

2490.31 --> 2496.67
or partially always partially scripted

2493.58 --> 2500.48
everybody has their papers or their the

2496.67 --> 2503.0
teleprompters every single one there may

2500.48 --> 2504.71
be unique exceptions like for example

2503.0 --> 2506.47
Ron Paul I don't know if he uses

2504.71 --> 2510.23
teleprompter I don't know if he needs it

2506.47 --> 2512.48
and but most most do it is technically

2510.23 --> 2514.93
all the state show but that doesn't mean

2512.48 --> 2517.46
that besides the show you get to see

2514.93 --> 2521.6299999999997
there's not actual decisions being made

2517.46 --> 2525.08
there's not actual opposition's so don't

2521.63 --> 2527.9300000000003
underestimate that you get to see is a

2525.08 --> 2531.56
stage show in a way it is controlled

2527.93 --> 2535.0099999999998
kind of oppositional agreement control

2531.56 --> 2536.48
but does it mean that it's all fake that

2535.01 --> 2538.25
they all are just saying okay you're

2536.48 --> 2539.87
gonna do this that I'm gonna do that up

2538.25 --> 2541.94
until this point and then we go with

2539.87 --> 2542.5099999999998
that plan where you both go the other

2541.94 --> 2545.66
direction

2542.51 --> 2548.51
that doesn't happen pretty sure it

2545.66 --> 2550.16
doesn't there may be overarching things

2548.51 --> 2552.59
that they know about that are gonna

2550.16 --> 2554.75
happen that they do adapt to and that

2552.59 --> 2559.61
they know from each other that they know

2554.75 --> 2562.34
that and are adapting to it but that's

2559.61 --> 2564.6800000000003
just like a cultic secret knowledge or

2562.34 --> 2569.2400000000002
whatever from from the Brotherhood or

2564.68 --> 2572.6
you know but they are a part in

2569.24 --> 2574.43
opposition personally us also personally

2572.6 --> 2579.22
invested don't underestimate the

2574.43 --> 2579.22
personal investment you know

2580.71 --> 2586.05
now some people are not so personally

2583.589 --> 2589.23
invested or rather they're personally

2586.05 --> 2591.78
invested in a way that has nothing to do

2589.23 --> 2593.94
with the tagline or with the principles

2591.78 --> 2596.4900000000002
that are being used by the party or

2593.94 --> 2598.9500000000003
whatever the things that are said but

2596.49 --> 2601.9199999999996
then it's personal because that person

2598.95 --> 2604.47
wants to use that system to get ahead to

2601.92 --> 2608.64
get power to get more fame to crush and

2604.47 --> 2610.589
get on top to be the king that's what

2608.64 --> 2613.92
some politicians want but that becomes

2610.589 --> 2619.74
more overtly visible to everyone as they

2613.92 --> 2622.41
progress but other than those people

2619.74 --> 2625.859
there are definitely politicians there

2622.41 --> 2628.2599999999998
that really just are some doing trying

2625.859 --> 2629.0989999999997
to do something what they think is right

2628.26 --> 2631.0200000000004
over there

2629.099 --> 2632.4900000000002
going in some direct could be kind of

2631.02 --> 2635.45
liberal maybe old-fashioned liberal

2632.49 --> 2638.3089999999997
maybe already bit tainted or could be

2635.45 --> 2640.41
conservative concerned about how

2638.309 --> 2642.78
conservatives have kind of been taken

2640.41 --> 2646.5
over in like another neoliberal way

2642.78 --> 2648.21
weird trying to be more libertarian and

2646.5 --> 2650.73
then there's the conservatives that

2648.21 --> 2653.88
really think like yeah now screw that

2650.73 --> 2655.98
bottom line old-fashioned and but

2653.88 --> 2658.7000000000003
they're all in their own ways trying to

2655.98 --> 2661.29
do something that they think is right

2658.7 --> 2668.25
it's not the same as they're just doing

2661.29 --> 2671.579
it all for the power so yeah they do do

2668.25 --> 2674.819
real things but what you get to see on

2671.579 --> 2677.369
the show on the television on the stage

2674.819 --> 2680.43
performances on the debates all that

2677.369 --> 2683.79
from politics yes that is definitely a

2680.43 --> 2686.7
stage joke I can confirm that you can

2683.79 --> 2690.54
see that it's obvious its overt that

2686.7 --> 2696.72
they are do pro following a program

2690.54 --> 2698.79
their program you know and again they

2696.72 --> 2700.6189999999997
get caught flat-footed because they are

2698.79 --> 2702.66
typically following program but at the

2700.619 --> 2704.7200000000003
same time it's also become especially

2702.66 --> 2707.67
during debates more usual that people

2704.72 --> 2709.5
some politicians are just very sharply

2707.67 --> 2712.14
informed in some way so maybe social

2709.5 --> 2713.579
maybe technical and they will lay down

2712.14 --> 2714.06
arguments that the other one can't

2713.579 --> 2715.5600000000004
respond

2714.06 --> 2717.18
- and then you get the red herrings in

2715.56 --> 2720.12
the straw man just like on the debates

2717.18 --> 2722.2999999999997
with the globus fairies fairies the

2720.12 --> 2726.9
similarities are staggering staggering

2722.3 --> 2729.54
so people well I can tell you that the

2726.9 --> 2732.6
Flat Earth debates with the ballers and

2729.54 --> 2738.54
the flat earthers that it's not a stage

2732.6 --> 2740.85
show it's not so real and some people

2738.54 --> 2742.92
are there for their ego that's also the

2740.85 --> 2748.83
same and some we're there to accomplish

2742.92 --> 2751.8
something for something positive it's

2748.83 --> 2753.81
the same but it yeah II that is not a

2751.8 --> 2758.51
stage show we all do that we all learn

2753.81 --> 2758.5099999999998
it it's just an open room and we're all

2759.47 --> 2769.41
functioning in a self-taught way that's

2763.77 --> 2770.94
a difference anyway I'm gonna round out

2769.41 --> 2773.1
the show the flattery debates have just

2770.94 --> 2775.38
started up so thanks everyone for coming
