third right yeah dude I saw you in the

203.2 --> 209.79899999999998
chat man

206.36 --> 212.08
damn duper you're being a real Soldier

209.799 --> 212.08
being a

214.72 --> 224.04
trooper man but like what the [ __ ] that

220.56 --> 228.599
that chat was

224.04 --> 231.56
crazy tet was just going insane in

228.599 --> 234.879
there like what the [ __ ] is up with like

231.56 --> 234.879
what has happened to that

237.84 --> 243.239
guy he's just [ __ ] trolling now like

247.079 --> 254.4
why but anyway yeah that's just it for

250.599 --> 257.959
me like I he's now on like I'm giving

254.4 --> 260.56
giving full green light to the

257.959 --> 262.72
ridicule because this is just

260.56 --> 267.52
Preposterous what he's doing he's just

262.72 --> 271.6
full on doing like the Arwin marriage

267.52 --> 271.59999999999997
and all that like [ __ ] off

272.72 --> 275.24
it's just

277.639 --> 281.56
ridiculous so uh

286.68 --> 291.759
yeah right but I'm live now

292.039 --> 296.039
and let's see what we could talk about I

294.759 --> 299.0
don't know if I'm going to have a long

296.039 --> 301.4
show though right but yeah the main

299.0 --> 304.12
reason I was late is

301.4 --> 306.59999999999997
because I really needed to go to the

304.12 --> 306.6
grocery

307.759 --> 313.16
store cuz like it's been two days in a

310.479 --> 316.199
row that I went there after the show and

313.16 --> 318.47900000000004
then there was no bread and I really

316.199 --> 321.36
needed it this

318.479 --> 323.84
time and and that basically like screwed

321.36 --> 327.199
up the entire schedule

323.84 --> 330.79999999999995
so also I'm not really I've not felt

327.199 --> 334.44
that great but did manage to just call

330.8 --> 339.08
my healer just before the show like half

334.44 --> 342.56
an hour ago or something which was very

339.08 --> 345.28
necessary cuz I'm going through like a

342.56 --> 348.36
storm phase

345.28 --> 351.4
again it sort of sneaked up on me but I

348.36 --> 355.52000000000004
mean I'm just used to that

351.4 --> 355.52
happening yeah I know he's talking

356.199 --> 361.479
[ __ ]

358.479 --> 361.479
derer

362.0 --> 366.72
I'm just going through like an ancestral

363.919 --> 368.44
wind period kind of like what happens

366.72 --> 372.28000000000003
right after

368.44 --> 375.52
Christmas so I get angry more carried

372.28 --> 377.599
away that kind of thing more o over

375.52 --> 380.56
emotional response and all the trolls

377.599 --> 383.12
are thinking so

380.56 --> 385.199
funny they're probably just bullying

383.12 --> 387.8
because they feel the similar things and

385.199 --> 390.40000000000003
they can't face it so they're going to

387.8 --> 393.59000000000003
just project it out on me the guy that's

390.4 --> 394.96
being super honest about everything

393.59 --> 396.79999999999995
[Music]

394.96 --> 399.23999999999995
like

396.8 --> 404.24
yeah they can't help it they could just

399.24 --> 404.24
stay away but I mean they don't do

407.039 --> 412.15999999999997
they all right but even my healer just

410.0 --> 414.88
it's so funny because he like with a

412.16 --> 418.52000000000004
smile I could hear this smile through

414.88 --> 420.639
the phone he said like yeah well they

418.52 --> 423.28
keep

420.639 --> 425.36
making so much noise and like trying to

423.28 --> 427.79999999999995
propagandize everywhere against you

425.36 --> 430.16
because you're telling them things that

427.8 --> 433.72
they really don't want to

430.16 --> 437.03900000000004
know they don't want to you're getting

433.72 --> 439.56
too real for him which is like a great

437.039 --> 442.039
compliment by the way to hear it from

439.56 --> 443.639
somebody like that because I mean

442.039 --> 445.479
generally you're saying everybody's like

443.639 --> 447.919
oh you're being hated that means you're

445.479 --> 451.039
on to something and that's like that's

447.919 --> 456.15999999999997
like common now people get

451.039 --> 459.0
that but like this is my healer we're

456.16 --> 461.759
talking about I'm talking about and like

459.0 --> 465.479
he's very spiritually

461.759 --> 468.159
capable and very strong and like add it

465.479 --> 471.0
most of his life like doing what I've

468.159 --> 473.28
basic what I'm doing in an

471.0 --> 475.09
unconventional

473.28 --> 476.96
way half my

475.09 --> 481.79999999999995
[Music]

476.96 --> 481.79999999999995
life and he's been much better at it

482.84 --> 486.03999999999996
[Music]

487.039 --> 492.8
really healer was a

489.52 --> 494.479
profession it's not the I just call him

492.8 --> 496.68
my healer I'm not going to say his name

494.479 --> 496.68
or

496.759 --> 501.8
anything but he's like a rodolph Steiner

505.28 --> 510.08
Master that's what you could call it and

508.759 --> 513.5600000000001
he follow

510.08 --> 513.56
that those systems as do

515.159 --> 522.039
I he applies the technique and you could

519.56 --> 523.1199999999999
say like he de probably helped develop

522.039 --> 526.48
it

523.12 --> 529.519
but that would not be entirely correct

526.48 --> 532.48
because everybody that does it develops

529.519 --> 535.0
it develops it and is capable of

532.48 --> 538.12
developing it in their own unique way

535.0 --> 540.959
that you can't really standard you can't

538.12 --> 546.72
sort of standardize but not really and

540.959 --> 546.7199999999999
like every time it's always unique in

547.2 --> 553.0790000000001
ways

549.12 --> 556.2
so but he's just very good at

553.079 --> 558.1999999999999
it I mean technically he like gets calls

556.2 --> 561.399
from people all

558.2 --> 563.5600000000001
day that are like help me I'm completely

561.399 --> 565.0
out of my body I'm like I can't handle

563.56 --> 567.8
things anymore

565.0 --> 571.12
like I know what's going on I can't do

567.8 --> 571.12
anything about it

573.72 --> 579.64
as was I like yeah

576.32 --> 579.6400000000001
I'm been

581.0 --> 587.519
like been like that for like two days I

584.279 --> 589.48
think and still despite that I'm still

587.519 --> 593.519
like having an interesting show and all

589.48 --> 596.04
that to a degree but also with that very

593.519 --> 599.8
dark expression in

596.04 --> 602.64
there and it's this is going to I kind

599.8 --> 605.88
of want to study that I want to like

602.64 --> 610.3199999999999
explain I want to explain what I am and

605.88 --> 610.32
what I do like what that

612.8 --> 617.3599999999999
is I and I did yesterday at the

615.36 --> 619.399
beginning of my show I talked about like

617.36 --> 622.399
wow yeah yesterday is like I hate all

619.399 --> 625.399
humanity and I explained about it that

622.399 --> 628.72
hey I actually wanted to say I also love

625.399 --> 629.959
it but it couldn't come out and that was

628.72 --> 634.24
really

629.959 --> 638.2399999999999
weird and it felt out of character as I

634.24 --> 641.0
was doing it and that is just a sign

638.24 --> 642.24
like you're not fully in your body

641.0 --> 646.76
because you're

642.24 --> 650.399
not doing it the way you want to do

646.76 --> 653.279
it it's like a percentage down of full

650.399 --> 655.959
grip control over your functions as it

653.279 --> 659.6
is happening and that's a sign like yeah

655.959 --> 664.5189999999999
you're not in your body your spirit is

659.6 --> 664.519
not in control of every aspect of

667.76 --> 673.36
you and that basically makes the way you

672.24 --> 677.9590000000001
express

673.36 --> 683.839
yourself different and out of character

677.959 --> 683.8389999999999
and if that like also goes over certain

684.12 --> 689.72
lines then it like very much seems like

687.839 --> 691.48
full possession

689.72 --> 693.72
like what we would experience is like

691.48 --> 696.0
that person is possessed by Rage or

693.72 --> 698.2
possessed by the devil or even something

696.0 --> 698.2
like

699.6 --> 705.9590000000001
that but to those that truly do think

704.079 --> 708.959
that like oh our when is possessed by

705.959 --> 711.04
the devil or something I can assure you

708.959 --> 714.04
that in those

711.04 --> 718.079
moments I might even think that that's

714.04 --> 720.3199999999999
happening but it isn't like it's I am

718.079 --> 726.0
still like like

720.32 --> 730.5600000000001
me it's just that the way I come I come

726.0 --> 734.6
out the way I become expressed

730.56 --> 737.199
just sometimes goes into regions

734.6 --> 738.639
where like I don't really know I don't

737.199 --> 741.3199999999999
even

738.639 --> 742.8
like I don't even fully back what comes

741.32 --> 745.88
out of me

742.8 --> 748.199
sometimes it's just that when that

745.88 --> 751.56
starts happening I am prioritized to

748.199 --> 755.3599999999999
just finish [ __ ] like just

751.56 --> 759.76
make fulfill whatever is coming out and

755.36 --> 764.24
that is an oracle function that is what

759.76 --> 766.279
the Oracle does open up whatever comes

764.24 --> 768.48
through

766.279 --> 771.4399999999999
communicated and in that sense it's like

768.48 --> 774.399
I'm not fully me I'm not like the

771.44 --> 777.839
individual consciousness of me that's

774.399 --> 780.839
coming through it's a message coming

777.839 --> 780.839
through

783.44 --> 788.9200000000001
and if you don't realize that about me

785.519 --> 793.32
then it'll just seem completely

788.92 --> 797.76
crazy like this guy's completely losing

793.32 --> 801.32
control even though it's like whoop I

797.76 --> 803.36
once it's out there's a great relief and

801.32 --> 807.36
then I get full control back so it's

803.36 --> 810.72
like it has to come out the message

807.36 --> 815.1990000000001
especially if it's some that I know like

810.72 --> 815.1990000000001
everybody will hate but it's

817.12 --> 824.5600000000001
true then it's like I am

820.519 --> 828.32
compelled to to show it it's like an

824.56 --> 831.279
oath I have to do that like if I don't

828.32 --> 833.48
do that like I don't know what would

831.279 --> 835.16
happen to me at this point because of

833.48 --> 837.12
the tension that's on me it's like I

835.16 --> 840.399
must do

837.12 --> 842.6
that like if I would would be made

840.399 --> 844.48
incapable of doing it I would risk

842.6 --> 847.32
serious depression and this is even

844.48 --> 849.839
what's happened every time for some

847.32 --> 852.5600000000001
reason people get offended enough to

849.839 --> 855.399
like get me a strike or something I mean

852.56 --> 857.3599999999999
that [ __ ] makes really bad impact it it

855.399 --> 861.16
really hurts

857.36 --> 864.1990000000001
because now I can't do that I can't

861.16 --> 866.959
fulfill my function I can't show

864.199 --> 871.079
you can't show you the truth it's my

866.959 --> 871.079
oath I can't fulfill my oath to

876.72 --> 881.6800000000001
God and when that happens I risk

885.65 --> 888.779
[Music]

893.199 --> 898.279
collapse at this point it's really weird

895.8 --> 900.639
I got this weird intuitive feeling and

898.279 --> 903.16
you could say magical thinking like oh

900.639 --> 904.8
people don't really even know you how

903.16 --> 906.92
many people do really know you most

904.8 --> 909.639
people that click they just click away

906.92 --> 913.16
very quickly when they find something

909.639 --> 915.12
about you they don't like or they get a

913.16 --> 918.0
moment of your anger right at the wrong

915.12 --> 922.32
spot and they're like oh oh no way I'm

918.0 --> 925.48
out of here so that's fine but I do feel

922.32 --> 928.399
like if I'd

925.48 --> 930.36
stop like a certain influence that I

928.399 --> 933.0
have just by being

930.36 --> 935.0790000000001
there not even like people would have to

933.0 --> 937.56
watch me but just me doing it has like

935.079 --> 941.88
an influence and if I'd

937.56 --> 945.2399999999999
retract that it would do serious

941.88 --> 948.759
like damage would further engage out

945.24 --> 952.04
there if I'd stop I have this

948.759 --> 956.44
sense if I stop doing what I do it's I

952.04 --> 959.319
feel like I'm essential doing this but

956.44 --> 961.7900000000001
it's a yeah it's a Feeling and like I

959.319 --> 963.8389999999999
can't logically justify

961.79 --> 968.319
[Music]

963.839 --> 968.3190000000001
it you can only take it on

972.04 --> 978.079
faith aren't you afraid you might die

974.959 --> 978.079
from your might

978.959 --> 986.04
yeah that's that's the that's like the

982.68 --> 989.3599999999999
ironic duper but the point is is that

986.04 --> 992.48
while it was happening

989.36 --> 995.0
I was covered in

992.48 --> 998.12
dread about

995.0 --> 1001.639
dying like it felt like it could die any

998.12 --> 1004.0
moment like it's all over and like

1001.639 --> 1006.0790000000001
everything I want

1004.0 --> 1009.12
can't like there's no more point I

1006.079 --> 1013.3599999999999
couldn't grasp anything it's like it it

1009.12 --> 1013.36
was an overall very damning

1017.48 --> 1021.9590000000001
experience

1019.04 --> 1028.199
and hey when I woke out of

1021.959 --> 1031.3999999999999
it back I felt really really

1028.199 --> 1034.16
depleted but despite all of and this is

1031.4 --> 1036.88
the mystery about it is that in the

1034.16 --> 1039.28
waking world I can actually still feel

1036.88 --> 1042.64
hope it's just that now there's this

1039.28 --> 1046.439
giant thing on the other side that's

1042.64 --> 1050.4
like takes more space in that's like

1046.439 --> 1050.4
competing with the

1050.679 --> 1058.039
the faith like hope and trust like no it

1054.48 --> 1059.52
must be good like how else could

1058.039 --> 1062.16
anything

1059.52 --> 1064.08
work and look at the infinite Miracles

1062.16 --> 1067.919
of our body and and all that if there's

1064.08 --> 1067.9189999999999
infinite Miracles of our body

1069.08 --> 1076.1999999999998
then then how could the spirit be that

1074.36 --> 1079.039
doomed

1076.2 --> 1080.3600000000001
see just

1079.039 --> 1082.679
the thing is the only thing that's

1080.36 --> 1085.28
really preventing me from just absolute

1082.679 --> 1088.24
doom and hell is logic

1085.28 --> 1092.6399999999999
itself and truth and so my whole

1088.24 --> 1097.559
esoteric approach of God is truth

1092.64 --> 1100.6000000000001
literally and Satan is lies

1097.559 --> 1104.2
literally is like really the thing

1100.6 --> 1109.32
that's kind of kept me stable enough to

1104.2 --> 1111.48
not go completely like hurting myself or

1109.32 --> 1114.32
or

1111.48 --> 1116.6
worse when I get in these weird

1114.32 --> 1118.6
ancestral wind moods which have always

1116.6 --> 1120.799
been very terrible on me every time that

1118.6 --> 1123.0
happens because it's just I lose control

1120.799 --> 1126.039
it feels like everything is

1123.0 --> 1128.84
just becomes

1126.039 --> 1132.24
chaos see too

1128.84 --> 1134.9599999999998
much nobody can understand it that

1132.24 --> 1137.6
experience when you're in it you don't

1134.96 --> 1141.2
connect with people as well because you

1137.6 --> 1143.08
can't get to that simpler frequency in

1141.2 --> 1145.44
order to

1143.08 --> 1148.039
[Music]

1145.44 --> 1150.2
connect but at the same time it's like

1148.039 --> 1154.0
you are like

1150.2 --> 1154.0
feeling everything and it's

1154.08 --> 1158.36
stormy it's a challenge to deal with it

1156.72 --> 1161.88
but it is

1158.36 --> 1163.52
like something that's just with me I

1161.88 --> 1166.919
actually had a conversation with my

1163.52 --> 1168.4
healer about over the phone just now

1166.919 --> 1170.24
trying to figure out like where's it

1168.4 --> 1172.3200000000002
come from where's this rage coming from

1170.24 --> 1176.88
is this inherited

1172.32 --> 1179.0
is is this like an a curse or an outside

1176.88 --> 1182.5590000000002
influence like is it tied to my grandpa

1179.0 --> 1182.559
who also had rage issues

1183.08 --> 1187.96
but it's

1185.44 --> 1190.96
different he and this was super

1187.96 --> 1195.32
surprising to me I mean to hear that

1190.96 --> 1199.96
from him but my ear said like uh it's

1195.32 --> 1203.0
because of your past life what

1199.96 --> 1207.4
okay but was was that like what the hell

1203.0 --> 1207.4
was my past life for me to be like

1211.48 --> 1218.2
this what the hell like it's not

1214.72 --> 1221.039
entirely what I expected but it at least

1218.2 --> 1225.2
isn't like a family curse or a demon

1221.039 --> 1225.2
that's like in my family it's not like

1227.159 --> 1233.0390000000002
a

1229.039 --> 1235.28
it's not because of a devil contract in

1233.039 --> 1235.28
my

1237.96 --> 1242.679
family there I say a Jew

1242.88 --> 1248.8400000000001
curse am I a hippie what kind of

1245.52 --> 1251.039
question is that who are you asking

1248.84 --> 1255.9189999999999
hello

1251.039 --> 1260.12
what Jo shop is that you moio

1255.919 --> 1260.1200000000001
Gustavo did you change your name

1261.48 --> 1265.679
[Music]

1264.2 --> 1268.679
or is it not

1265.679 --> 1268.679
moo

1271.32 --> 1274.32
What

1275.36 --> 1280.24
anyway no someone who did yoga almost

1278.12 --> 1281.76
died because he couldn't right well they

1280.24 --> 1285.44
probably were

1281.76 --> 1288.72
just yeah yoga look

1285.44 --> 1291.64
duper it's like there's things you could

1288.72 --> 1296.0
do with your spirit but just because you

1291.64 --> 1300.0800000000002
can or it can be done doesn't mean that

1296.0 --> 1303.08
anybody can just do it yeah if you don't

1300.08 --> 1306.9189999999999
have the proper foundations and Dynamics

1303.08 --> 1308.52
and energy quanta of your spirit and all

1306.919 --> 1310.6000000000001
like these

1308.52 --> 1313.12
Necessities if you're just going to like

1310.6 --> 1315.84
oh I'm just going to do this High yoga

1313.12 --> 1318.1999999999998
Master thing and then like oh I'm just

1315.84 --> 1320.6
going to do an out of body thing through

1318.2 --> 1323.48
yeah well you're doing something that

1320.6 --> 1326.1589999999999
those people that do actually do that

1323.48 --> 1328.44
know like how dangerous that actually

1326.159 --> 1330.4
can be and they're like properly Spirit

1328.44 --> 1332.0800000000002
guarded and they're like really strong

1330.4 --> 1335.1200000000001
and there's a necessity there's a

1332.08 --> 1337.6789999999999
mission behind it it's very necessary

1335.12 --> 1339.4399999999998
anytime you're going to deal with weird

1337.679 --> 1342.5590000000002
spiritual things if you're not Guided by

1339.44 --> 1348.8400000000001
a mission you're just trying it out to

1342.559 --> 1353.279
see bro you could curse yourself so bad

1348.84 --> 1355.72
don't do higher magic just to just be

1353.279 --> 1358.039
try it out it's not like it's drugs or

1355.72 --> 1360.24
and don't even do drugs like

1358.039 --> 1363.1589999999999
that if you're going to try something

1360.24 --> 1364.0
out through the spirit you have to have

1363.159 --> 1366.3200000000002
a

1364.0 --> 1368.72
mission you have to have a reason why

1366.32 --> 1370.9189999999999
you're doing it not just because you

1368.72 --> 1373.52
want an

1370.919 --> 1374.76
ability yeah an ability without a

1373.52 --> 1376.96
mission is

1374.76 --> 1379.6
just

1376.96 --> 1381.6000000000001
dangerous

1379.6 --> 1383.32
yeah you don't give it a mission well a

1381.6 --> 1386.1589999999999
mission will find you and it will

1383.32 --> 1386.1589999999999
usually be a

1392.44 --> 1398.0800000000002
demon no I'm Legit

1394.799 --> 1400.76
OG yeah but I'm just asking are you Mojo

1398.08 --> 1404.4399999999998
Gustaf or you just happen to call Mojo

1400.76 --> 1409.8799999999999
too because it's all

1404.44 --> 1409.88
good 2014 that's long

1417.24 --> 1421.76
[Music]

1418.52 --> 1421.76
M right

1425.2 --> 1431.8400000000001
anyway some deep

1427.679 --> 1431.8400000000001
stuff thought I wanted to share

1433.52 --> 1436.52
it

1436.88 --> 1439.88
like

1442.0 --> 1446.48
yeah introspective stuff also I have to

1444.4 --> 1450.159
be careful with the coffee I've noticed

1446.48 --> 1453.279
I asked and he told me before a long

1450.159 --> 1455.48
time ago but yeah the coffee has been

1453.279 --> 1459.52
great

1455.48 --> 1463.039
but when I get into ancestral wind phase

1459.52 --> 1463.039
I have to be very careful with

1464.159 --> 1470.3990000000001
it it's funny like even how my he

1468.32 --> 1473.6
described how that has an influence like

1470.399 --> 1478.52
it makes people more robotic more easy

1473.6 --> 1478.52
to just go with a flow system

1479.039 --> 1488.08
but you know whose domain that

1483.679 --> 1491.48
is yeah robotics autom

1488.08 --> 1493.1999999999998
automated systems automated flows yeah

1491.48 --> 1496.76
that's

1493.2 --> 1498.3600000000001
aramon oh

1496.76 --> 1499.96
simplification

1498.36 --> 1504.1589999999999
so

1499.96 --> 1506.3600000000001
it's coffee is a risky drug it will if

1504.159 --> 1508.919
you're like addicted to coffee it will

1506.36 --> 1511.36
numb down certain senses about you

1508.919 --> 1511.3600000000001
subtle

1512.48 --> 1518.679
senses in

1514.559 --> 1522.72
ways but if you're not like a yeah an

1518.679 --> 1525.2
empath full spiritual person like me

1522.72 --> 1526.799
then you'll barely notice you'll barely

1525.2 --> 1529.679
notice the difference because you never

1526.799 --> 1529.679
see those things and

1530.24 --> 1536.32
anyway right but I mean other people

1533.32 --> 1540.399
that deal in spiritual matters like they

1536.32 --> 1540.399
some of them know like yeah coffee is

1540.48 --> 1546.88
bad but I mean yeah I I can't downplay

1544.52 --> 1548.96
that coffee has been

1546.88 --> 1551.96
very

1548.96 --> 1556.2
helpful it warmed me up when I was cold

1551.96 --> 1557.8400000000001
it got me going when I was slow but once

1556.2 --> 1558.96
you get going then you kind of kind of

1557.84 --> 1562.799
got to

1558.96 --> 1562.799
stop once you're out of

1564.48 --> 1569.3990000000001
that and so now I'm at the same position

1567.52 --> 1571.799
as when I where I was before with the

1569.399 --> 1574.1999999999998
coffee it's like on the risk and now I

1571.799 --> 1577.36
should actually just stop again I don't

1574.2 --> 1579.48
know if I will I I'm going to try

1577.36 --> 1581.4799999999998
because now it's been really brought to

1579.48 --> 1584.159
my conscious thanks to the direct

1581.48 --> 1586.52
answers of my healer like he

1584.159 --> 1588.7990000000002
doesn't wind around anything it just

1586.52 --> 1591.9189999999999
says it directly as it

1588.799 --> 1597.48
should as

1591.919 --> 1597.48
God does just straight on Truth

1597.919 --> 1602.919
boom can you be conscious without the

1604.559 --> 1608.12
spirit

1606.32 --> 1612.039
no not

1608.12 --> 1615.279
really I mean it could just be there you

1612.039 --> 1615.279
just want nothing

1615.36 --> 1622.7199999999998
will it's like nothing reaches you

1618.76 --> 1624.36
then if you're completely without Spirit

1622.72 --> 1626.2
then just nothing reaches you it all

1624.36 --> 1630.799
just bounces off you there's something

1626.2 --> 1630.799
else that's going to be in the way

1640.88 --> 1646.919
internally the spirit integration is

1643.52 --> 1649.1589999999999
also what enables you to deal better

1646.919 --> 1653.0
with the inter things that you're

1649.159 --> 1656.7990000000002
dealing with and thereby also being more

1653.0 --> 1659.679
op open and rece receiving to

1656.799 --> 1659.679
information in

1659.72 --> 1667.29
general that all requires your

1663.11 --> 1667.29
[Music]

1668.0 --> 1673.679
spirit I think you can it's called being

1670.679 --> 1678.44
an NPC yeah you could call it that or a

1673.679 --> 1683.0
zombie you know all those things are AR

1678.44 --> 1687.44
manic it's one side of the devil Lucifer

1683.0 --> 1690.559
the the Arrogant one the the trickster

1687.44 --> 1694.1200000000001
the the liar The

1690.559 --> 1696.72
Seducer but aramon is the destroyer and

1694.12 --> 1696.7199999999998
the the

1697.96 --> 1702.44
roboticizer the

1699.96 --> 1705.08
eugenicist like always trying to cut

1702.44 --> 1708.159
things away always it wants to end up

1705.08 --> 1712.48
with nothing the spirit of nothing the

1708.159 --> 1714.7990000000002
spirit of the abyss of the Void arimon

1712.48 --> 1714.799
at the

1715.24 --> 1719.44
end but

1717.279 --> 1723.559
robotization even though

1719.44 --> 1725.519
convenient is his domain and here's how

1723.559 --> 1727.84
it works spiritually if you

1725.519 --> 1729.519
roboticize then you're like yeah you

1727.84 --> 1732.32
don't have to worry about anything you

1729.519 --> 1735.279
just go with it but because you're just

1732.32 --> 1738.96
so used to it you care less about what's

1735.279 --> 1741.039
happening around you because

1738.96 --> 1743.32
you don't have to be

1741.039 --> 1745.44
responsible because if you're not

1743.32 --> 1747.279
responsible you'll still be safe and it

1745.44 --> 1750.039
doesn't matter to them to you what

1747.279 --> 1753.84
happens to them and so you then slide

1750.039 --> 1756.279
that down that moral slide further down

1753.84 --> 1758.399
aran's

1756.279 --> 1761.72
domain you don't

1758.399 --> 1763.8799999999999
care you're with the

1761.72 --> 1766.32
winner

1763.88 --> 1769.3200000000002
see

1766.32 --> 1769.32
automated

1770.6 --> 1775.24
that's how it

1772.24 --> 1779.88
[Music]

1775.24 --> 1784.44
works this is also how luxury

1779.88 --> 1787.159
is aran's domain also because it will

1784.44 --> 1787.159
pose that

1787.88 --> 1790.7600000000002
problem what are you going to do with

1789.96 --> 1794.6000000000001
all

1790.76 --> 1794.6
that luxury and

1796.32 --> 1801.039
time you're going to end up trying to

1798.919 --> 1804.3400000000001
protect

1801.039 --> 1807.45
it and do more damage to others that

1804.34 --> 1807.4499999999998
[Music]

1810.12 --> 1814.9599999999998
way but

1811.96 --> 1814.96
anyway

1815.08 --> 1821.399
uh do you know some people can't imagine

1818.2 --> 1824.44
a red apple in that what okay no I did

1821.399 --> 1824.4399999999998
not know that that's

1826.24 --> 1829.24
weird

1831.399 --> 1836.7299999999998
anyway you got more questions Richard GE

1833.24 --> 1847.36
is a good question I like that sort of

1836.73 --> 1849.64
[Music]

1847.36 --> 1853.519
question right but it's interesting too

1849.64 --> 1853.519
you know can you be conscious without a

1854.08 --> 1859.559
spirit well maybe your spirit

1857.88 --> 1861.8400000000001
is

1859.559 --> 1864.0
like directly tied in with your

1861.84 --> 1865.799
conscious I mean if your spirit and your

1864.0 --> 1869.159
conscious can be outside of your body

1865.799 --> 1871.6
well then that means like your conscious

1869.159 --> 1875.24
could function just with your spirit and

1871.6 --> 1875.24
without your body

1875.919 --> 1881.2
separate what the word you keep saying

1878.36 --> 1881.1999999999998
arimon

1883.519 --> 1888.1200000000001
yes that's from the Rudolph Steiner

1886.0 --> 1892.0
cosmology and rudol sign here like in

1888.12 --> 1894.639
his cosmology system Spirit cosmology

1892.0 --> 1896.279
specifically makes a distinguishment

1894.639 --> 1900.279
between the dark

1896.279 --> 1904.519
Forces you have Christ at the

1900.279 --> 1908.24
center you have Lucifer and araman

1904.519 --> 1910.559
surrounding Christ trying to get to

1908.24 --> 1912.799
him that's where you go when you stray

1910.559 --> 1912.799
the

1914.76 --> 1919.72
path those are the patterns of the

1917.399 --> 1923.0
mistakes that you are going to

1919.72 --> 1924.7
make if you Stray From the Path that's

1923.0 --> 1926.679
the esoterics of

1924.7 --> 1929.0
[Music]

1926.679 --> 1932.3600000000001
it

1929.0 --> 1934.559
right it it's just it's an important I

1932.36 --> 1937.12
think it's a good thing to do it's an

1934.559 --> 1941.32
important distinguishment to

1937.12 --> 1943.84
make to see the the separate forces of

1941.32 --> 1943.84
the dark

1946.08 --> 1949.08
sides

1950.12 --> 1958.32
[Music]

1956.84 --> 1960.519
right you could see it's like oh it's

1958.32 --> 1962.76
the right hand and the left hand of the

1960.519 --> 1965.2
devil but you're just attributing one

1962.76 --> 1970.72
more power to one

1965.2 --> 1973.88
entity and are they or are they just two

1970.72 --> 1978.76
forces that are actually competing in a

1973.88 --> 1983.0800000000002
way it's like the devil and the demon

1978.76 --> 1985.6
and they're competing over who gets to

1983.08 --> 1985.6
do their

1995.88 --> 2000.5590000000002
thing in the Eternal War which is

1998.44 --> 2002.44
interestingly like written about even in

2000.559 --> 2004.399
the Dungeons and Dragons cosmology I

2002.44 --> 2008.0800000000002
mean that's what's so fascinating about

2004.399 --> 2012.76
it to me all of it like rol Steiner had

2008.08 --> 2015.1589999999999
this brilliant Insight so long ago 100

2012.76 --> 2018.32
years ago it's

2015.159 --> 2020.7990000000002
incredible and entire reality has just

2018.32 --> 2023.279
like no we're not going to recognize

2020.799 --> 2025.84
that we're going to have our own version

2023.279 --> 2029.88
how we think reality

2025.84 --> 2029.8799999999999
is you know what that all

2035.96 --> 2040.76
is

2037.96 --> 2040.76
we're living in

2045.12 --> 2051.919
it do you really think the Earth is flat

2049.0 --> 2054.52
this it just trolling yes I mean it's

2051.919 --> 2057.839
just trolling for

2054.52 --> 2060.919
1864 shows in a

2057.839 --> 2064.04
row that's how that

2060.919 --> 2064.919
works now the Earth is definitely flat

2064.04 --> 2068.079
measure

2064.919 --> 2070.0
it calculated

2068.079 --> 2073.0
observed

2070.0 --> 2073.0
navigated

2095.879 --> 2098.879
flat

2102.77 --> 2145.139
[Music]

2155.8 --> 2158.8
that

2161.96 --> 2168.38
[Music]

2173.04 --> 2176.96
yay it's the title

2175.74 --> 2181.56
[Music]

2176.96 --> 2181.56
now hey blue P Devolution good to see

2183.0 --> 2190.119
you when we say those things about Earth

2185.88 --> 2190.119
we're reading is script according to Bob

2191.16 --> 2194.48
what what

2202.72 --> 2211.7999999999997
script then yeah it's just

2206.9 --> 2215.4
[Music]

2211.8 --> 2217.88
silly how much of AI is fear mongering a

2215.4 --> 2221.1600000000003
lot and this this is the funny thing

2217.88 --> 2223.0
with like uh Elon Musk because he

2221.16 --> 2226.16
actually like knows

2223.0 --> 2231.85
that I've been like sort of saying like

2226.16 --> 2236.8799999999997
no it's super overplayed AI is just so

2231.85 --> 2236.88
[Music]

2239.839 --> 2245.839
overplayed bad energy based on what I've

2243.16 --> 2248.5989999999997
exper oh that's cool Jacob but I have my

2245.839 --> 2248.599
own experience

2250.359 --> 2258.64
thanks and beside it's

2254.52 --> 2263.52
esoterics this is like Spirit mechanics

2258.64 --> 2267.0
I'm not claiming any entity like a

2263.52 --> 2267.0
specific these are

2267.56 --> 2274.0
forces you could call it bad energy but

2270.56 --> 2275.599
they are forces It's Not Just Energy

2274.0 --> 2278.96
it's what it

2275.599 --> 2282.03
does what does the energy

2278.96 --> 2282.03
[Music]

2296.76 --> 2301.88
do right and have plenty of

2305.52 --> 2308.52
experiences

2323.92 --> 2330.92
Hollow no no well Hollow it's not

2328.28 --> 2332.8390000000004
concave yeah the Earth's surface the

2330.92 --> 2334.48
geometric orientation of the earth's

2332.839 --> 2337.96
surface is

2334.48 --> 2342.04
flat very very

2337.96 --> 2344.56
flat there may be some Cavern beneath us

2342.04 --> 2347.079
though somewhere I think if anywhere

2344.56 --> 2350.56
it's going to be below Bulgaria or

2347.079 --> 2350.5600000000004
something but

2352.119 --> 2360.2000000000003
uh yeah the Earth surface that we're

2355.44 --> 2360.2000000000003
living on that's definitely not on the

2360.319 --> 2365.839
inside of

2362.839 --> 2369.119
something like above us is not the other

2365.839 --> 2372.7999999999997
side of of the

2369.119 --> 2375.23
land we're not in a concave world the

2372.8 --> 2378.849
Earth is surface is

2375.23 --> 2378.849
[Music]

2383.76 --> 2390.44
flat yeah Rich G but I mean isn't it

2387.2 --> 2393.7599999999998
just so typical these days right

2390.44 --> 2395.88
everybody wants to hear about everything

2393.76 --> 2396.92
but they don't want to hear what it

2395.88 --> 2399.04
really is

2396.92 --> 2401.48
they just want to feel

2399.04 --> 2404.48
informed so there's whole hordes of

2401.48 --> 2407.44
people that are like trying to be on the

2404.48 --> 2409.2
edge of the game they're improvising and

2407.44 --> 2411.56
it doesn't even matter anymore that

2409.2 --> 2414.96
they're improvising because it's just

2411.56 --> 2417.96
about people wanting to feel like they

2414.96 --> 2420.079
think they're at the tip of the spear

2417.96 --> 2423.599
but they don't actually want to know

2420.079 --> 2425.3590000000004
anything because they can't handle it

2423.599 --> 2427.44
it's too much

2425.359 --> 2431.7999999999997
strain

2427.44 --> 2431.8
but they want to feel like they're doing

2432.24 --> 2436.2
something so everybody's just all these

2434.599 --> 2437.76
people out there they're like yeah no

2436.2 --> 2440.24
I'm so good at this and they just

2437.76 --> 2442.0400000000004
Twisted in a certain way and like

2440.24 --> 2444.64
everybody's like

2442.04 --> 2446.96
relieved oh thank

2444.64 --> 2449.64
God thank God he didn't tell me the

2446.96 --> 2449.64
whole truth

2450.44 --> 2456.04
there right they are God I mean that's

2453.56 --> 2459.2
literally thank Satan like oh thank

2456.04 --> 2463.839
Satan for the lie to protect

2459.2 --> 2463.839
me from the face of God that I can't

2466.86 --> 2475.8
[Music]

2472.359 --> 2478.52
handle the Earth is like a giant what

2475.8 --> 2481.699
duper stop

2478.52 --> 2481.699
[Music]

2485.24 --> 2490.68
it

2487.88 --> 2492.8
that is really silly and funny though I

2490.68 --> 2497.3999999999996
have to give it

2492.8 --> 2501.8
you but damn duper where do

2497.4 --> 2501.8
you such a goofball

2515.24 --> 2520.3399999999997
sometimes

2516.87 --> 2520.3399999999997
[Music]

2530.04 --> 2534.319
alien stuff that is

2532.72 --> 2537.7599999999998
processed

2534.319 --> 2540.92
what aliens oh did you get

2537.76 --> 2543.28
aliens dude on the other side and a lot

2540.92 --> 2545.6800000000003
of things can happen the whole point

2543.28 --> 2548.0
about the dark world is that anything

2545.68 --> 2549.8799999999997
can be to be believed it's all about

2548.0 --> 2552.8
what are you believing oh you believe

2549.88 --> 2554.96
that well guess what they are going to

2552.8 --> 2558.04
approach you with with the thing that

2554.96 --> 2560.2
you're really into and believe and the

2558.04 --> 2561.52
more delusional the more power they can

2560.2 --> 2565.5989999999997
get over

2561.52 --> 2568.72
you it's all Devils all of it and you

2565.599 --> 2570.92
know them by recognizing the truth from

2568.72 --> 2572.7999999999997
the lie that's the only way you can

2570.92 --> 2574.319
actually protect yourself from getting

2572.8 --> 2576.7200000000003
contracted with

2574.319 --> 2580.4
them is by knowing

2576.72 --> 2583.1189999999997
what is lies and then recognizing as

2580.4 --> 2584.839
you're being pulled towards them through

2583.119 --> 2587.119
the lies being contracted through the

2584.839 --> 2589.44
lies oh you want this thing you want

2587.119 --> 2590.76
this thing that's not really possible a

2589.44 --> 2593.19
just come with

2590.76 --> 2599.409
me

2593.19 --> 2599.409
[Music]

2604.24 --> 2608.9199999999996
huh H Earth was it trap

2607.4 --> 2614.44
[Music]

2608.92 --> 2618.0
yes but in a way Hollow Earth is just

2614.44 --> 2621.0
like another trying it's just

2618.0 --> 2624.52
like because all they do is like how can

2621.0 --> 2627.44
we take every single idea and somehow

2624.52 --> 2629.599
turn it into a globe and the only one

2627.44 --> 2630.7200000000003
that in which that doesn't work is with

2629.599 --> 2635.96
flat

2630.72 --> 2636.5989999999997
Earth cuz you just can't somehow like

2635.96 --> 2641.0
but

2636.599 --> 2641.96
yeah but it's a still a globe although I

2641.0 --> 2645.48
have to

2641.96 --> 2648.599
say I tried with my flat

2645.48 --> 2653.16
Globe at show

2648.599 --> 2655.6400000000003
one but I mean nobody can handle

2653.16 --> 2657.0789999999997
that people rather to say like oh no

2655.64 --> 2659.24
it's all an illusion it's all an

2657.079 --> 2661.6800000000003
illusion a simulation Theory we can't de

2659.24 --> 2664.4799999999996
with this the can't be real can't be a

2661.68 --> 2667.64
flat Globe can't be looping can't be

2664.48 --> 2670.2400000000002
holographic oh that means everything is

2667.64 --> 2672.92
holographic if something in this world

2670.24 --> 2677.72
is holographic and not as we presupposed

2672.92 --> 2681.88
it to be then it must all be an

2677.72 --> 2681.8799999999997
illusion yeah that's what they're

2690.0 --> 2696.68
doing so is the Earth

2692.839 --> 2700.5589999999997
hollow what without aliens

2696.68 --> 2701.48
uh Jacob we don't know what other beings

2700.559 --> 2704.0
are

2701.48 --> 2706.64
there there may definitely be other

2704.0 --> 2711.359
beings in Shale I think there're

2706.64 --> 2715.68
Shale but it's just the that's called

2711.359 --> 2715.68
Shale it's the the room below

2717.079 --> 2720.3590000000004
us the

2721.559 --> 2727.88
underworld yeah a physical space below

2725.16 --> 2727.8799999999997
us

2731.559 --> 2737.48
they good or

2733.52 --> 2737.48
bad how the hell should I

2743.88 --> 2751.119
know like what is good or bad how do you

2747.119 --> 2753.4
find good or bad like what do you think

2751.119 --> 2754.2000000000003
will happen if we start to make contact

2753.4 --> 2758.64
with

2754.2 --> 2761.5589999999997
them yeah and then figure out how do you

2758.64 --> 2762.839
define good or bad as what follows of

2761.559 --> 2767.119
such a

2762.839 --> 2767.119
contact it's a bit complicated

2779.76 --> 2787.559
right right but I mean there might be

2783.44 --> 2789.359
different type of humanoids out there I

2787.559 --> 2794.6800000000003
think there are still

2789.359 --> 2797.5589999999997
Giants North O yeah in the North in the

2794.68 --> 2801.1189999999997
lands in the north beyond the North Pole

2797.559 --> 2801.88
point that line beyond the anti equator

2801.119 --> 2804.76
in the

2801.88 --> 2806.76
north I think there might be Giants

2804.76 --> 2809.7200000000003
there

2806.76 --> 2812.3190000000004
and yeah there might be weird creatures

2809.72 --> 2815.04
below us maybe they're like Golem type

2812.319 --> 2816.359
creatures I I wouldn't be too eager to

2815.04 --> 2818.319
seek them out

2816.359 --> 2821.839
I

2818.319 --> 2824.52
mean a species that literally living

2821.839 --> 2824.52
without the

2825.2 --> 2831.16
sun humanoid I I it doesn't sound very

2828.64 --> 2834.44
appealing to

2831.16 --> 2837.96
me right but I mean there might be like

2834.44 --> 2841.319
even weird other blue creatures or

2837.96 --> 2843.64
something there below us

2841.319 --> 2846.92
or to the

2843.64 --> 2849.16
South beyond the beaches of Sou South

2846.92 --> 2851.359
Antarctica you know there might be all

2849.16 --> 2855.68
kinds of things out there dude there

2851.359 --> 2858.2
might be actual reptile

2855.68 --> 2861.04
humans the whole thing like David Ike

2858.2 --> 2866.359
like oh I saw I saw in your

2861.04 --> 2869.96
eyes well that might be like

2866.359 --> 2873.359
Offspring like hybrid offspring of like

2869.96 --> 2876.88
full on reptile humanoids that are like

2873.359 --> 2880.7999999999997
over there just sitting in their jungle

2876.88 --> 2880.8
and they're like yeah we stay away from

2881.0 --> 2884.4
humans they're

2885.079 --> 2891.4
crazy I who

2887.4 --> 2891.4
knows I'm all open for

2893.45 --> 2901.0
[Music]

2896.2 --> 2901.0
it goblo mods what the

2904.0 --> 2907.92
hell what is going on on

2917.4 --> 2923.2400000000002
here how about what may cause the ti

2920.24 --> 2926.04
yeah no flush nope Looper you got it

2923.24 --> 2930.4799999999996
wrong I already addressed what causes

2926.04 --> 2934.16
ties now my Approach is well typical

2930.48 --> 2936.16
what I do I say angel spoons and I say

2934.16 --> 2938.7599999999998
that that specific specifically

2936.16 --> 2941.48
partially as a joke but I think that the

2938.76 --> 2944.4
tides are caused

2941.48 --> 2947.319
magnetically cuz that's how it

2944.4 --> 2950.2400000000002
looks and it is like a spoon it's just

2947.319 --> 2953.799
these regions that are just like like a

2950.24 --> 2956.1189999999997
spoon is just in a cup just twisting it

2953.799 --> 2957.839
and so it's just moving and that's what

2956.119 --> 2960.88
seems to happen with the tide so I call

2957.839 --> 2963.119
it Angel spoons they're like

2960.88 --> 2964.48
magnetic things that are happening and

2963.119 --> 2966.839
you could think of them like oh the

2964.48 --> 2971.28
Angel flying there with the

2966.839 --> 2973.319
spoon as a as a nice image I mean and

2971.28 --> 2976.76
don't claim this literally an angel with

2973.319 --> 2979.359
a magnetics just you could think of it

2976.76 --> 2982.0
like that you could think of it as like

2979.359 --> 2985.4
a thing that just naturally happens by

2982.0 --> 2987.559
the design of God so anything that is

2985.4 --> 2989.319
like inherent to the system that just

2987.559 --> 2992.3190000000004
naturally happens is technically

2989.319 --> 2996.119
designed by God so you could think of

2992.319 --> 2997.2
them as angels that are like spooning

2996.119 --> 2999.319
the

2997.2 --> 3001.839
ocean

2999.319 --> 3005.119
magnetically

3001.839 --> 3008.48
right Angel

3005.119 --> 3010.839
spoons I did shows with titles Angel

3008.48 --> 3016.04
spoon in

3010.839 --> 3020.92
there H big foot oh

3016.04 --> 3024.319
God yeah yeah maybe big feet I mean

3020.92 --> 3026.6800000000003
Sasquatch by the way is the actual name

3024.319 --> 3029.119
yeah I mean

3026.68 --> 3033.48
I mean with serious Sasquatch I'm like

3029.119 --> 3033.48
yeah I mean who cares like

3037.64 --> 3041.92
probably I mean there might be Sasquatch

3040.2 --> 3044.96
out there I mean that would be pretty

3041.92 --> 3048.04
cool I think although it's probably not

3044.96 --> 3050.7200000000003
that cool to them because I mean humans

3048.04 --> 3050.72
are [ __ ]

3052.079 --> 3060.079
insane so like it doesn't seem very nice

3057.24 --> 3063.68
like thinking about like oh I'm a

3060.079 --> 3065.88
Sasquatch I can like cloak or whatever

3063.68 --> 3068.2799999999997
if I really attune myself or I could

3065.88 --> 3071.28
like try to look be more like a human

3068.28 --> 3073.8390000000004
being and like humans are [ __ ] up dude

3071.28 --> 3077.119
and it's getting worse

3073.839 --> 3080.24
like if I was a Sasquatch Society I'd be

3077.119 --> 3081.839
like let's get the hell out of here

3080.24 --> 3084.9199999999996
let's go to like

3081.839 --> 3087.68
this this mountain that's like let's

3084.92 --> 3090.319
just go to like

3087.68 --> 3092.2799999999997
somewhere yeah Beyond Antarctica let's

3090.319 --> 3097.2799999999997
like go into a submarine or something

3092.28 --> 3100.28
and just go way the way away from here

3097.28 --> 3102.2400000000002
cuz these humans are just they're going

3100.28 --> 3105.8390000000004
completely

3102.24 --> 3107.9199999999996
demonic they'll be eating us before you

3105.839 --> 3110.319
know it because they think they might

3107.92 --> 3113.599
get some powers or something like the

3110.319 --> 3113.599
humans are that [ __ ]

3114.359 --> 3117.359
crazy

3124.92 --> 3130.76
so there is something Beyond Antarctica

3127.16 --> 3133.799
I'm presupposing there is yes I don't

3130.76 --> 3136.7990000000004
know but I mean there could definitely

3133.799 --> 3139.47
be and if there were I have a pretty

3136.799 --> 3142.61
good idea at like how that would

3139.47 --> 3142.6099999999997
[Music]

3144.28 --> 3147.28
be

3155.44 --> 3161.64
satellites

3158.28 --> 3161.6400000000003
[ __ ] no

3166.72 --> 3175.8799999999997
people FES our junkyard a scrap

3170.68 --> 3178.24
metal yeah I mean isn't it just silly

3175.88 --> 3181.319
isn't it just silly like

3178.24 --> 3185.2799999999997
this this giant science fiction movie is

3181.319 --> 3185.2799999999997
just being constructed around us

3185.68 --> 3190.799
and and they just keep going I mean you

3188.72 --> 3192.7599999999998
got to see that it's just a science

3190.799 --> 3195.04
fiction story at this point you got to

3192.76 --> 3195.0400000000004
see

3197.52 --> 3201.319
it or you got a

3204.16 --> 3207.16
problem

3211.079 --> 3214.2000000000003
space needs to be

3224.599 --> 3230.3590000000004
clear yeah but I'm sure that Elon Musk

3227.799 --> 3232.28
will find some kind of oh we're going to

3230.359 --> 3235.16
we're going to scoop the junk we're

3232.28 --> 3236.6800000000003
going to recycle all the space junk and

3235.16 --> 3239.04
and it's going to be the special Boy

3236.68 --> 3241.72
again

3239.04 --> 3244.52
so I might be making a prediction now

3241.72 --> 3247.2
that's like really surreal but yeah I

3244.52 --> 3250.799
mean create a fake

3247.2 --> 3253.0
problem everybody expects it because

3250.799 --> 3255.48
they presuppose it's real and then oh

3253.0 --> 3259.48
here's the guy with the resources he

3255.48 --> 3263.48
could do it and he can fool into fixing

3259.48 --> 3265.48
the fake problem and be a hero for it

3263.48 --> 3267.559
for all the people that actually believe

3265.48 --> 3271.359
that's

3267.559 --> 3274.3590000000004
real I mean it's very

3271.359 --> 3274.359
cheap

3277.28 --> 3281.119
right reminds me yeah

3290.25 --> 3293.449
[Music]

3294.079 --> 3297.079
exactly

3305.359 --> 3312.72
gravity all oh really oh my God we got a

3309.04 --> 3312.72
full Ballard in the chat

3313.0 --> 3316.0
today

3319.88 --> 3326.96
wow that sentence right there is just

3323.359 --> 3328.319
like yeah there's somebody that made

3326.96 --> 3332.52
zero

3328.319 --> 3335.92
progression in probably 50 years or

3332.52 --> 3335.92
something that you

3341.48 --> 3345.48
Sean yeah never go full

3351.0 --> 3356.079
Ballard I mean to compare this guy

3353.48 --> 3360.16
showing up here in this show after all

3356.079 --> 3363.2000000000003
this saying that is like a little kid

3360.16 --> 3366.799
coming over to like this electrician

3363.2 --> 3369.2
shop and then saying like I can get a

3366.799 --> 3373.16
job here and then they just

3369.2 --> 3376.799
put their nose in like into a light

3373.16 --> 3379.7599999999998
socket or something and electrocute like

3376.799 --> 3383.92
what the [ __ ] like

3379.76 --> 3387.559
no no you definitely

3383.92 --> 3387.559
can't this is so

3402.0 --> 3406.48
ridiculous just a gatekeeper I don't

3404.44 --> 3407.359
know man I think that ballards are their

3406.48 --> 3410.2400000000002
own

3407.359 --> 3412.4
Gatekeepers it is a religion they spout

3410.24 --> 3414.359
their faith they have to keep it simple

3412.4 --> 3416.119
and then everybody else that spouts that

3414.359 --> 3417.88
faith can have the feeling like oh

3416.119 --> 3420.28
there's another one of

3417.88 --> 3422.52
us that's what it is they're not

3420.28 --> 3425.44
Gatekeepers they're not actually paid

3422.52 --> 3428.52
top down to do that they do it because

3425.44 --> 3432.359
they feel they need to do that it's

3428.52 --> 3435.559
their religious duty to repeat super

3432.359 --> 3439.2
outdated idiotic

3435.559 --> 3441.44
arguments and not be researched about it

3439.2 --> 3444.2799999999997
not actually no there's been like a

3441.44 --> 3446.799
decade of debating and researching about

3444.28 --> 3446.799
those subjects

3451.4 --> 3455.28
like they gatekeep themselves it's you

3453.799 --> 3458.599
don't have to say sorry I'm just

3455.28 --> 3458.599
correcting you no

3458.839 --> 3464.799
worries and yeah there are Gatekeepers

3461.48 --> 3467.599
out there Jacob I'm just

3464.799 --> 3471.2
saying when it comes to the ball

3467.599 --> 3474.559
religion most of them are Gatekeepers

3471.2 --> 3478.96
for themselves I know all about it

3474.559 --> 3483.079
because because I used to do exactly

3478.96 --> 3484.88
that it didn't get paid that's where BWI

3483.079 --> 3486.52
came from it's something that yeah I

3484.88 --> 3489.119
don't you don't see that a lot anymore

3486.52 --> 3492.48
because I used to mostly do that on

3489.119 --> 3495.359
fed it's like like yeah we

3492.48 --> 3497.44
construct this reality we have to figure

3495.359 --> 3501.2
it out as we

3497.44 --> 3503.64
go if you just figure out how it's EV

3501.2 --> 3505.5989999999997
all then everything will be all right

3503.64 --> 3509.96
and like oh

3505.599 --> 3509.96
how You' figure that out just keeps

3511.359 --> 3518.16
changing right you just assume it's a

3513.76 --> 3518.1600000000003
ball and then work your way up from

3518.359 --> 3524.799
there and I loved it I loved it as a

3521.16 --> 3527.2
game I took it very serious but I didn't

3524.799 --> 3531.119
like tie it in with my ego like oh my

3527.2 --> 3535.0
God if I feel to believe it's a ball

3531.119 --> 3537.76
then then I have to get hurt by it that

3535.0 --> 3539.799
or something like no it's always just

3537.76 --> 3543.3190000000004
been a game a game I get very

3539.799 --> 3543.319
enthusiastic and carried away

3545.88 --> 3551.359
with but I was never hurt by the Earth

3549.16 --> 3555.52
not being a

3551.359 --> 3558.0
globe I got just confused by

3555.52 --> 3560.079
it and then just had a parallel

3558.0 --> 3562.4
construction like oh here's the whole

3560.079 --> 3565.44
society trying to make it into a globe

3562.4 --> 3567.799
I'm very good at that oh am I a good boy

3565.44 --> 3569.16
trying to be a good boy and on the other

3567.799 --> 3571.28
side like whoa people are telling me

3569.16 --> 3573.96
like no it's actually flat it's all a

3571.28 --> 3575.96
lie this is how it works we don't know

3573.96 --> 3580.0
everything

3575.96 --> 3580.96
like okay what I don't know how to deal

3580.0 --> 3584.359
with

3580.96 --> 3586.2
that like but thank you for being honest

3584.359 --> 3588.2799999999997
I could tell like you're actually being

3586.2 --> 3591.799
you're not trying to hurt

3588.28 --> 3593.799
me it's just that I don't know how to

3591.799 --> 3598.2
deal with that in this world if I tell

3593.799 --> 3598.2
other people they like assault

3599.16 --> 3606.72
me so I just didn't do that until 2015

3603.359 --> 3609.52
where it's like it it's okay we we can

3606.72 --> 3612.1189999999997
talk about it we can now talk about it

3609.52 --> 3616.24
oh my God we can now talk about it

3612.119 --> 3619.1600000000003
woohoo Earth is flat guys it's

3616.24 --> 3622.72
flat yeah that that was what that was

3619.16 --> 3625.3999999999996
like to me right it's just like oh my

3622.72 --> 3628.1189999999997
God we can just finally be honest

3625.4 --> 3633.079
and and not and still have people to

3628.119 --> 3633.079
talk to about it and that was

3634.559 --> 3639.3190000000004
great instead of just always being

3637.16 --> 3641.319
afraid like oh my God I hope nobody

3639.319 --> 3643.119
heard me say the Earth was flat because

3641.319 --> 3645.599
they're going to make me lose my job or

3643.119 --> 3648.559
something or going to talk [ __ ] about me

3645.599 --> 3653.52
spread false rumors about me just to get

3648.559 --> 3656.52
me f because they do that yeah people do

3653.52 --> 3656.52
that

3660.96 --> 3667.119
do your roommates believe Earth is

3664.119 --> 3670.2000000000003
flood uh I think that they are very well

3667.119 --> 3674.079
aware that if they make a choice about

3670.2 --> 3678.5589999999997
that they have to then deal with this

3674.079 --> 3682.52
hell called bardia

3678.559 --> 3685.88
people and they don't like to tap their

3682.52 --> 3689.24
toes into that s in demonic pool so

3685.88 --> 3691.319
they're like I'll Trust you on that I'm

3689.24 --> 3693.7599999999998
it's not my business and they hear me

3691.319 --> 3695.88
out though I'll tell them things I tell

3693.76 --> 3699.44
them things they're

3695.88 --> 3702.4
smart they're cool the ladies the guy is

3699.44 --> 3704.039
like doing his own thing like he he's

3702.4 --> 3706.839
just like this young guy that's doing

3704.039 --> 3708.92
this stuff I can't get involved like

3706.839 --> 3711.16
he's there to like do stuff and make

3708.92 --> 3713.44
mistakes and figure it out but he's like

3711.16 --> 3716.92
at least already at that age dealing

3713.44 --> 3718.64
with healthy diet and all that which is

3716.92 --> 3721.319
admirable I wasn't doing that at that

3718.64 --> 3725.16
age I was starting that later so that's

3721.319 --> 3728.64
good but I mean he's a guy but the girls

3725.16 --> 3728.64
like they're they get

3730.319 --> 3736.72
it but they're not like yeah they're

3734.559 --> 3741.2000000000003
just kind of happy that I can be just

3736.72 --> 3741.2
honest and not bully them about

3743.359 --> 3748.48
anything

3746.279 --> 3751.119
because people out here there's a lot of

3748.48 --> 3751.119
just

3766.29 --> 3771.599
[Music]

3768.64 --> 3772.799
bullies yeah yeah thanks Jacob for being

3771.599 --> 3776.119
here

3772.799 --> 3776.92
and yeah this is good to thank you for

3776.119 --> 3781.039
your

3776.92 --> 3783.44
input I'm always ready to like compare

3781.039 --> 3785.2000000000003
how we see things like you had a certain

3783.44 --> 3787.88
view when you came

3785.2 --> 3790.0
in I have my view and then we compare

3787.88 --> 3792.6800000000003
and it's like I'm not

3790.0 --> 3794.799
excluding those views it's just that

3792.68 --> 3797.0
there are many mistakes that tend to

3794.799 --> 3800.079
accompany that way of seeing things and

3797.0 --> 3803.039
it's like there's better models but I

3800.079 --> 3805.0
mean I you can't just expect everybody

3803.039 --> 3806.6400000000003
that's like holding on to that entire

3805.0 --> 3808.64
life and then have that ingrained to

3806.64 --> 3811.24
just like oh yeah you just need to

3808.64 --> 3814.72
abandon that this is the better one like

3811.24 --> 3816.72
people don't do that but if you can make

3814.72 --> 3818.5989999999997
them understand another system then they

3816.72 --> 3820.9599999999996
might be able to like parallel construct

3818.599 --> 3823.079
it keep their old one and then

3820.96 --> 3827.3
understand how their old one can be the

3823.079 --> 3828.7200000000003
new one do it the new way in their old

3827.3 --> 3832.079
[Music]

3828.72 --> 3834.4399999999996
format and not thereby having to like

3834.44 --> 3840.76
it to save their life at times

3837.76 --> 3842.2400000000002
right so it's like yeah I totally

3840.76 --> 3845.6400000000003
understand like the Christian type

3842.24 --> 3848.0389999999998
thinking cosmology and all that I just

3845.64 --> 3850.839
really trust the Rudolph Steiner based

3848.039 --> 3855.079
cosmology it is so much clearer and it

3850.839 --> 3855.0789999999997
just everything about it works it's just

3856.359 --> 3861.44
weird it's weird how it work so damn

3863.2 --> 3866.2

it's a COR deviation it's just too

3912.319 --> 3917.96
little it's too little we can't tell

3915.68 --> 3921.7599999999998
just like the curve oh we're too small

3917.96 --> 3926.079
we can't see it Earth too biggie corol

3921.76 --> 3926.079
is deviation too SMY

3926.72 --> 3934.4399999999996
right you know the Earth is a spinning

3930.359 --> 3936.319
Ball by that you can't see the curvature

3934.44 --> 3939.119
because your Earth too

3936.319 --> 3942.52
Biggie and you can't notice the corelis

3939.119 --> 3943.96
deviation because it's too small e right

3942.52 --> 3946.4
and that's how we know the Earth is a

now a thanks to my

3973.96 --> 3978.2
healer otherwise I would have just

3975.839 --> 3981.24
kicked this guy out already and got more

3978.2 --> 3981.24
cranky but I'm

3983.0 --> 3986.0
not

4013.0 --> 4020.48
let make an ass of himself yeah

4017.64 --> 4024.68
sure I mean it's

4020.48 --> 4027.4
just what basic duper don't ex I'm being

4024.68 --> 4031.16
sarcastic now do actually expect but I

4027.4 --> 4033.6800000000003
mean don't expect him to actually back

4031.16 --> 4037.1189999999997
any kind of claim that he's putting

4033.68 --> 4039.52
forward as EV like with

4037.119 --> 4041.2400000000002
evidence he literally doesn't understand

4039.52 --> 4044.0389999999998
what he's talking

4041.24 --> 4045.839
about it's what a balar does they just

4044.039 --> 4049.4
regurgitate these things and that they

4045.839 --> 4049.4
don't understand what it even

4049.559 --> 4055.4
is this this colloquially constructed

4055.76 --> 4062.3190000000004
nonsense resting on like oh but if the

4059.079 --> 4066.079
majority thinks it's real then it's

4062.319 --> 4066.079
real consensus

4068.4 --> 4075.92
science Rin wasn't a flat I don't give a

4072.92 --> 4075.92
[ __ ]

4083.68 --> 4087.0789999999997
connected with the whole un oh you think

4085.4 --> 4089.52
he's talking

4087.079 --> 4092.279
physically

4089.52 --> 4094.88
there no it sounds like he just kind of

4092.279 --> 4097.12
left it ambiguous right because

4094.88 --> 4100.319
otherwise everything he wrote would have

4097.12 --> 4100.3189999999995
been like

4102.839 --> 4105.839
destroyed

4106.839 --> 4113.6
yeah I'm sure he

4108.6 --> 4115.679
did I'm sure he did you know though that

4113.6 --> 4120.08
he was a

4115.679 --> 4123.279
German around Nazi Germany time yeah if

4120.08 --> 4124.679
he probably hadn't said that there's a

4123.279 --> 4128.319
good chance that would have just

4124.679 --> 4130.4800000000005
destroyed all of his work you realize

4128.319 --> 4134.0
that right since it was the freaking

4130.48 --> 4137.959999999999
Nazis that really started doing that

4134.0 --> 4141.04
yeah then later went over to the United

4137.96 --> 4144.96
States yeah to become part of NASA yeah

4141.04 --> 4144.96
yeah yeah yaw it

4161.199 --> 4166.719
up right I mean

4164.4 --> 4167.96
I'm just glad he was able to roll out

4166.719 --> 4171.52
the spirit

4167.96 --> 4174.64
cosmology as he saw it that's what I'm

4171.52 --> 4178.319
really interested in I don't care about

4174.64 --> 4179.88
his cosmogeny of like the physical

4178.319 --> 4182.679
world

4179.88 --> 4186.319
like it's barely part of his

4182.679 --> 4190.2390000000005
conversation and his legacy anyway he's

4186.319 --> 4190.2390000000005
mostly just talking about Spirit

4191.0 --> 4196.44
mechanics he died there yeah oh but yeah

4194.32 --> 4199.48
before that oh and I

4196.44 --> 4202.239
mean these [ __ ] in chat think that

4199.48 --> 4205.48
before 9035 there were there was no

4202.239 --> 4208.239
Nazism there or anything they weren't

4205.48 --> 4210.5599999999995
rolling out propaganda and doing all

4208.239 --> 4213.48
that [ __ ] and making plans oh of course

4210.56 --> 4213.4800000000005
no nothing

4219.84 --> 4225.64
there now he was in the middle of all of

4223.4 --> 4225.639999999999
that

4230.04 --> 4238.64
yeah there was a lot

4232.56 --> 4238.64
happening in Germany before World War

4247.159 --> 4251.32

4312.4 --> 4320.599999999999
there yeah yeah I know he

4315.04 --> 4323.32
was that that is a well spotted but I

4320.6 --> 4325.280000000001
mean just don't give him attention Okay

4323.32 --> 4327.84
we're not talking about that crap we're

4325.28 --> 4331.4
having a very interesting show here

4327.84 --> 4334.1990000000005
talking about Spirit mechanics

4331.4 --> 4336.199
and and Rudolph Steiner and I think

4334.199 --> 4339.5199999999995
that's a much more interesting subject

4336.199 --> 4342.48
than a bunch of treacherous gamas

4339.52 --> 4345.4800000000005
showing their ugly

4342.48 --> 4345.48
side

4366.8 --> 4369.879
[Music]

4381.84 --> 4385.159000000001
it's getting dark out

4402.36 --> 4405.36
there

4407.159 --> 4411.638999999999
yeah no blue Evolution not just that

4410.28 --> 4415.84
they they

4411.639 --> 4417.84
hover the satellites hover due to a lack

4415.84 --> 4422.56
of gravity they just

4417.84 --> 4422.56
float they just float

4425.08 --> 4432.36
right because gravity which is what they

4428.88 --> 4435.12
think causes vertical passive

4432.36 --> 4437.88
displacement which is actually caused by

4435.12 --> 4441.48
relative density this equilibrium Force

4437.88 --> 4442.6
they think that that gravity just stops

4441.48 --> 4445.28
at some

4442.6 --> 4448.120000000001
point high

4445.28 --> 4450.84
up which is kind of preposterous because

4448.12 --> 4452.8
in reality the higher up you

4450.84 --> 4456.88
go the

4452.8 --> 4460.08
less friction any physical object will

4456.88 --> 4464.639
have falling down heightening

4460.08 --> 4468.4
its uh what do you call it again teral

4464.639 --> 4471.400000000001
velocity and maximizing the density this

4468.4 --> 4474.48
equilibrium because thinner air is less

4471.4 --> 4478.28
dense than a

4474.48 --> 4480.4
object much less dense than an object

4478.28 --> 4483.12
compared to thicker air down at the

4480.4 --> 4486.48
ground so things will actually go faster

4483.12 --> 4489.12
the higher up you go that's the

4486.48 --> 4491.839999999999
reality and this misconception of

4489.12 --> 4494.32
gravity supposedly ending at a certain

4491.84 --> 4498.0
distance is Absol abely ridiculous and

4494.32 --> 4499.92
there's no physics groundworks to even

4498.0 --> 4502.199
make that claim

4499.92 --> 4504.0
because gravity is not supposed to be

4502.199 --> 4506.4
able to do

4504.0 --> 4508.679
that because it's not a

4506.4 --> 4512.08
force even though you can think of it as

4508.679 --> 4517.4400000000005
a force and be incorrect when you do

4512.08 --> 4522.199
so yeah so it just gravity has no

4517.44 --> 4524.719
relation to that claim in physics

4522.199 --> 4527.4
officially just has nothing to do with

4524.719 --> 4527.4
anything

4532.719 --> 4537.44
really why Sun didn't fall to earth sun

4536.04 --> 4541.92
is not an

4537.44 --> 4543.48
object it's a light a very very big

4541.92 --> 4546.36
apparent

4543.48 --> 4549.678999999999
light or as I like to say it's an

4546.36 --> 4552.639
angular manifestation with an

4549.679 --> 4556.159
apparent bright visual disc at the

4552.639 --> 4559.400000000001
epicenter of the angular manifestation

4556.159 --> 4562.239
only apparent to that specific Observer

4559.4 --> 4564.879999999999
not an object no actual

4562.239 --> 4568.04
location but I know that that's a little

4564.88 --> 4572.32
bit much for your heliocentric condition

4568.04 --> 4572.32
physicality assumption by his riddled

4582.12 --> 4585.12
brain

4588.4 --> 4594.36
doesn't work in the vacuum no

4591.84 --> 4597.84
directionality directionality has

4594.36 --> 4597.839999999999
nothing to do with relative

4598.679 --> 4604.679
density yeah they're

4601.76 --> 4607.639
Cardinal the less dance go up more dance

4604.679 --> 4610.28
go down and that's Cardinal is

4607.639 --> 4613.36
everywhere there is no

4610.28 --> 4616.639
relative relativity in the direction of

4613.36 --> 4619.28
the passive vertical

4616.639 --> 4621.400000000001
displacement yeah which is relative

4619.28 --> 4624.12
density disequilibrium

4621.4 --> 4627.12
Force passive

4624.12 --> 4627.12
vertical

4642.0 --> 4645.0
displacement

4649.8 --> 4659.159000000001
lie down no answer in

4654.88 --> 4664.2390000000005
why what the [ __ ] is why have to do with

4659.159 --> 4668.0
anything relative density describes what

4664.239 --> 4670.36
happens it's scientifically proven it's

4668.0 --> 4673.719
repeatable it always happens like that

4670.36 --> 4677.199
it it happens so much and so so

4673.719 --> 4681.6
consistently that it is can be

4677.199 --> 4685.5599999999995
considered as a natural law that it does

4681.6 --> 4690.04
that yeah it doesn't need to tell you

4685.56 --> 4693.280000000001
why it does that it just describes what

4690.04 --> 4696.28
happens every single

4693.28 --> 4696.28
time

4699.36 --> 4704.92
yeah oh God somebody let the cat in

4702.0 --> 4704.92
again

4709.32 --> 4714.28
no it's not an object oh there is light

4711.88 --> 4717.4400000000005
there's absolutely light there is heat

4714.28 --> 4719.759999999999
yep yep yeah an angular manifestation

4717.44 --> 4723.919999999999
you can't prove that it is originating

4719.76 --> 4725.639
from an object in space yeah there is no

4723.92 --> 4728.04
evidence

4725.639 --> 4731.12
whatsoever that proves that a

4728.04 --> 4733.6
perspective applies like would have to

4731.12 --> 4737.48
with object yeah when you you go closer

4733.6 --> 4739.76
to an object the angular size becomes

4737.48 --> 4741.239
bigger when you move away from the

4739.76 --> 4744.76
object it becomes

4741.239 --> 4749.799999999999
smaller and there can be no exception to

4744.76 --> 4752.719
that and if there is well then it's just

4749.8 --> 4756.400000000001
an appearance an apparition not an

4752.719 --> 4758.4800000000005
object in space and that's exactly what

4756.4 --> 4761.799999999999
all the celestial lights are they don't

4758.48 --> 4763.678999999999
have actual locations in space there's

4761.8 --> 4765.0
only the angular

4763.679 --> 4766.84
apparent

4765.0 --> 4771.719
manifestations with

4766.84 --> 4774.04
the appearing to be little spots little

4771.719 --> 4776.44
discs kind of is what they look like

4774.04 --> 4779.48
including the Moon and the Sun at the

4776.44 --> 4783.759999999999
epicenter of the angular manifestation

4779.48 --> 4783.759999999999
specific to the unique

4784.239 --> 4788.839999999999
Observer because the celestial lights

4787.0 --> 4791.4
are non-local

4788.84 --> 4794.159000000001
Holograms that are unique in their

4791.4 --> 4798.32
manifestation to every single

4794.159 --> 4801.5199999999995
Observer no sun looks exactly the same

4798.32 --> 4805.199
no sun cast the exact same

4801.52 --> 4808.719
Shadows yeah the Shadows that are cast

4805.199 --> 4810.759999999999
by the sun are different depending on

4808.719 --> 4813.2390000000005
your

4810.76 --> 4815.76
location somebody could be standing

4813.239 --> 4818.32
underneath clouds and see crepuscular

4815.76 --> 4821.0
Rays shine through those clouds clouds

4818.32 --> 4823.88
right in front of their feet because the

4821.0 --> 4827.6
sun is just right but if you take

4823.88 --> 4830.4400000000005
another guy on a mountain a few miles

4827.6 --> 4833.360000000001
away or quite a few miles away and then

4830.44 --> 4835.839999999999
zoom in on that location looking at the

4833.36 --> 4838.28
guy looking in front of his

4835.84 --> 4842.4400000000005
feet that person's not going to see any

4838.28 --> 4844.199
corpuscular race you know why because

4842.44 --> 4847.839999999999
for

4844.199 --> 4851.96
them the sun is not in the right

4847.84 --> 4854.52
location to shine through those clouds

4851.96 --> 4858.36
and form those crepuscular

4854.52 --> 4860.040000000001
race it only works for that person that

4858.36 --> 4862.159
is

4860.04 --> 4865.44
there that's the only one that's going

4862.159 --> 4869.08
to see him CU if you're not there if

4865.44 --> 4871.839999999999
you're too far away then the sun is in

4869.08 --> 4874.04
another apparent angular position and is

4871.84 --> 4875.28
not going to cast that light through

4874.04 --> 4878.12
those

4875.28 --> 4881.639
clouds like

4878.12 --> 4883.32
that yeah it's a non-local

4881.639 --> 4886.1990000000005
hologram

4883.32 --> 4890.199
I know it's quite a head cruncher isn't

5097.28 --> 5105.36
wow superseded yeah without any evidence

5102.36 --> 5105.36
though

5106.6 --> 5109.92
wow it's

5121.28 --> 5128.4
hilarious didn't know I going live yeah

5124.08 --> 5133.36
I'm going live late if you want to know

5128.4 --> 5134.36
then you know check my Twitter X I leave

5133.36 --> 5137.119
a

5134.36 --> 5139.199
message I always leave a message if I

5137.119 --> 5140.799999999999
don't show up then I leave a message

5139.199 --> 5143.28
that I don't show

5140.8 --> 5146.360000000001
up I mean it's going to be a bit late

5143.28 --> 5148.5599999999995
usually but but I did leave a message

5146.36 --> 5151.119
I'm going to go live later today and

5148.56 --> 5151.119000000001
that's what I've

5151.28 --> 5156.639
done

5153.36 --> 5160.96
right or just contact me on Skype and

5156.639 --> 5166.2390000000005
then you can ask me like steamy traveler

5160.96 --> 5166.2390000000005
did like hey you're late are you doing a

5167.0 --> 5173.199
show and then I can immediately answer

5169.719 --> 5177.6
him like yeah I'm doing a show

5173.199 --> 5177.599999999999
later you can do that too that's

5181.199 --> 5185.759999999999
okay

5183.119 --> 5188.28
a law of density sure duper you could

5185.76 --> 5189.96
call it the law of density it's not

5188.28 --> 5192.32
really relevant what it what it is

5189.96 --> 5194.08
called it's just like what is what how

5192.32 --> 5197.44
does it

5194.08 --> 5200.08
work well passive vertical displacement

5197.44 --> 5202.678999999999
is all caused by relative density dise

5200.08 --> 5202.679
equilibrium

5203.199 --> 5210.4
Force object is denser then the medium

5207.44 --> 5212.0
it is in and it is free to move even if

5210.4 --> 5212.92
it's not free to move then it will push

5212.0 --> 5214.44
down

5212.92 --> 5217.04
if it is free to move then it will move

5214.44 --> 5218.119
down it will accelerate down because

5217.04 --> 5222.4
there's a

5218.119 --> 5225.599999999999
force that causes the object to seek

5222.4 --> 5227.719
equilibrium with the medium it is in and

5225.6 --> 5229.400000000001
if it can't find that and it is denser

5227.719 --> 5232.2390000000005
then it will move down and if it can't

5229.4 --> 5236.799999999999
find it and it's less dense it will move

5232.239 --> 5238.209999999999
up why down because that's just the way

5236.8 --> 5240.76
it

5238.21 --> 5244.08
[Music]

5240.76 --> 5246.639
is it goes down because it's more dense

5244.08 --> 5249.719
it goes up because it's less

5246.639 --> 5251.92
dense just because because that's what

5249.719 --> 5251.92
it

5258.8 --> 5264.1990000000005
does oh my God is he still whing on

5261.639 --> 5267.1990000000005
about this freaking

5264.199 --> 5267.199
satellites

5268.8 --> 5276.04
dude why doesn't Moon doesn't fall

5273.6 --> 5278.8
because the Moon is not an object

5276.04 --> 5282.5199999999995
[ __ ] I just said so I just explained

5278.8 --> 5285.0
this to you yeah the Sun and the Moon

5282.52 --> 5289.040000000001
and the planets and the stars and all

5285.0 --> 5292.239
the lights in the sky are all Holograms

5289.04 --> 5292.239
including the

5293.8 --> 5302.56
moon they don't have actual

5298.76 --> 5306.0
positions when you try to move closer

5302.56 --> 5310.2390000000005
they move away from

5306.0 --> 5313.159
you there's only one thing in this world

5310.239 --> 5317.678999999999
that we know that does something like

5313.159 --> 5320.799999999999
that and that's like Halla mirror's

5317.679 --> 5323.6
effect like not objects not actually

5320.8 --> 5323.6
there it's an

5326.159 --> 5334.679
apparition objects don't do that when

5329.679 --> 5338.4400000000005
you approach them the celestial lights

5334.679 --> 5338.4400000000005
do they're not

5351.119 --> 5358.88
objects what physically there's only

5354.679 --> 5362.08
hydrogen and helium up there mixed in

5358.88 --> 5364.32
with particles of other types of gas

5362.08 --> 5365.8
because it's a homogeneous mesh but

5364.32 --> 5367.759999999999
that's going to be the majority that's

5365.8 --> 5371.320000000001
up there there's no objects up there

5367.76 --> 5373.159000000001
there's nothing physical up there except

5371.32 --> 5375.5599999999995
a barrier at some point and we don't

5373.159 --> 5377.96
even know what that is is that physical

5375.56 --> 5380.719
or is it literally the end of available

5377.96 --> 5383.4
volume for material to exist in it's

5380.719 --> 5385.88
just the end of volume we don't know is

5383.4 --> 5388.638999999999
there a physical structure

5385.88 --> 5392.96
there or isn't there but we do know

5388.639 --> 5396.6
there is a specific limited vol

5392.96 --> 5399.92
volume for the air to be in otherwise we

5396.6 --> 5402.119000000001
wouldn't have gas pressure because you

5399.92 --> 5404.4400000000005
have to have containment to have gas

5402.119 --> 5406.759999999999
pressure you have to have a limitation

5404.44 --> 5409.5199999999995
to the amount of volume that is

5406.76 --> 5410.96
available for the gas to move in

5409.52 --> 5414.56
otherwise it

5410.96 --> 5414.56
cannot create

5415.08 --> 5418.76
pressure it will just

5420.44 --> 5429.44
Escape how can we radar work it can't

5425.04 --> 5429.44
duper and neither can long-term

5430.199 --> 5438.5599999999995
ballistics like long distance artillery

5433.32 --> 5438.5599999999995
or sniper nothing works with

5446.56 --> 5451.2390000000005
curvature

5448.32 --> 5457.36
right but what does work fantastically

5451.239 --> 5457.36
with a flat Earth is radio towers

5459.239 --> 5467.839999999999
yeah those radio towers man you put

5462.52 --> 5467.84
enough juice in that they go very

5469.88 --> 5476.08
far very

5472.96 --> 5478.88
far I still remember from like

5476.08 --> 5481.04
the80s that when we were just more like

5478.88 --> 5483.28
some television and radio was still kind

5481.04 --> 5486.119
of relevant that was like yeah if you

5483.28 --> 5489.04
tunee it to certain am frequencies you

5486.119 --> 5493.32
can get Soviet Russian

5489.04 --> 5495.56
radio all the way from Moscow

5493.32 --> 5497.639
yeah that's

5495.56 --> 5500.92
from a

5497.639 --> 5502.88
antenna on Earth in

5500.92 --> 5506.32
Russia that's

5502.88 --> 5510.76
like a, kilometers

5506.32 --> 5513.759999999999
away yeah is definitely not blocked by

5510.76 --> 5513.76
curvature

5519.0 --> 5524.52
H yeah you don't need satellites because

5522.08 --> 5527.719
the Earth is not as faere you could just

5524.52 --> 5530.6
use radio towers and they can reach as

5527.719 --> 5534.119
far as they as you can use them

5530.6 --> 5534.119000000001
up that's how it

5535.88 --> 5542.8
works they don't connect directly

5539.52 --> 5544.400000000001
with can't connect directly

5542.8 --> 5546.360000000001
yeah why do you think that is it's

5544.4 --> 5547.92
because the distance is too vast you're

5546.36 --> 5551.159
still working with the inverse Square

5547.92 --> 5553.4400000000005
law of light effectively or similar to

5551.159 --> 5555.119
that dude they're not going to like

5553.44 --> 5557.839999999999
Juice It Up to the level where you're

5555.119 --> 5559.5199999999995
just like oh let's just go all the way

5557.84 --> 5562.8
through Earth

5559.52 --> 5565.92
dude it would be

5562.8 --> 5568.360000000001
lethal but theoretically possible like

5565.92 --> 5570.28
if for military purposes they could do

5568.36 --> 5573.08
that they could just like okay we're

5570.28 --> 5576.719
going to Shield the direct environment

5573.08 --> 5576.719
and then we're going to amp it up to

5577.44 --> 5582.119
like 100 billion Giga wats or something

5580.719 --> 5585.08
I don't know I'm just saying so like

5582.119 --> 5586.4
some insane amount of juice like Shield

5585.08 --> 5589.36
everything up because it's going to get

5586.4 --> 5589.36
roasted and then it's

5589.4 --> 5594.599999999999
like

5591.04 --> 5598.28
signal and like yeah yeah then you will

5594.6 --> 5600.320000000001
P pick it up in Canada from Australia

5598.28 --> 5602.599999999999
but I mean it's going to [ __ ] everything

5600.32 --> 5606.28
up it will potentially disrupt the

5602.6 --> 5609.4800000000005
weather systems if you do that but yeah

5606.28 --> 5609.48
that is theoretically

5612.28 --> 5619.0
possible it's just not really worth

5615.48 --> 5622.0
it yeah just spread out the antennas

5619.0 --> 5624.44
over the place it's much more efficient

5622.0 --> 5624.44
less

5625.76 --> 5628.76
damaging

5630.4 --> 5636.0
so yeah just because the Earth is flat

5632.88 --> 5638.4800000000005
doesn't mean that a signal can just go

5636.0 --> 5640.679
through infinite distance without

5638.48 --> 5643.759999999999
literally losing energy getting absorbed

5640.679 --> 5645.639
by the environment it's going through so

5643.76 --> 5646.679
you don't really have an argument there

5645.639 --> 5649.36
Dart

5646.679 --> 5652.8
one hey Tommy

5649.36 --> 5652.799999999999
sve good see

5660.48 --> 5663.48
you

5688.08 --> 5693.88
duper oh my

5690.159 --> 5693.879999999999
God you're so

5705.92 --> 5711.84
duper but you got a point I mean yeah

5708.48 --> 5715.04
radar yeah yeah radar is

5711.84 --> 5717.84
like that he first said like oh radio

5715.04 --> 5720.48
stations don't have that range yeah

5717.84 --> 5724.28
but that's why they have radar like

5720.48 --> 5726.959999999999
radar is like radio system except

5724.28 --> 5729.0
weaponized it's not there to communicate

5726.96 --> 5730.2390000000005
information it's to get a signal and

5729.0 --> 5733.36
it's much

5730.239 --> 5737.08
further it works on a flat

5733.36 --> 5741.92
Earth very far some radar systems can go

5737.08 --> 5744.119
thousands of miles or a th000 Way Beyond

5741.92 --> 5745.679
any

5744.119 --> 5750.4
curvature

5745.679 --> 5753.4
yeah so yeah duper has a point

5750.4 --> 5753.4
there

5770.199 --> 5773.678999999999
sounds like a great system

5779.28 --> 5788.63
H wow Jesus

5782.77 --> 5788.63
[Music]

5788.719 --> 5794.0
I don't see teret what you're trying to

5791.199 --> 5797.96
accomplish with your gamma hor [ __ ]

5794.0 --> 5797.96
you're just making it worse for yourself

5810.28 --> 5813.28
man

5847.03 --> 5850.25
[Music]

5852.239 --> 5858.638999999999
cats can buoys on the ocean act as

5855.6 --> 5858.639
Towers to Ping

5859.32 --> 5865.96
signals well not yeah if they're

5862.239 --> 5865.959999999999
specifically made to do that

5868.48 --> 5873.199
yes there probably some out there

5892.199 --> 5897.08
bro yeah the lighting does kind of suck

5894.8 --> 5900.119000000001
I know it's mostly like the light coming

5897.08 --> 5904.679
from my monitor that's just really too

5900.119 --> 5907.639
bright it's not the best look I

5904.679 --> 5910.56
know but to have it different I'd have

5907.639 --> 5912.32
to have like really good strong Studio

5910.56 --> 5915.4400000000005
lighting or something and then I could

5912.32 --> 5917.759999999999
make it look good unfortunately I don't

5915.44 --> 5920.36
have

5917.76 --> 5923.56
that that's why I also don't typically

5920.36 --> 5925.759999999999
like this stream at night or in the

5923.56 --> 5929.2390000000005
evening that's why I prefer the daylight

5925.76 --> 5929.2390000000005
because everything just looks way

5930.119 --> 5933.119
better

5933.32 --> 5940.599
and I don't look like I P pasty white

5937.239 --> 5943.598999999999
like a mine it almost looks like

5940.599 --> 5943.599
that

5960.04 --> 5964.56
ridiculous

5961.679 --> 5970.96
I'm just I just have this blinding

5964.56 --> 5974.56
whiteness to me behold the white that is

5970.96 --> 5976.09
me with my black clothing to contrast it

5974.56 --> 5979.26
even

5976.09 --> 5979.26
[Music]

5990.04 --> 5993.04
more

5998.56 --> 6002.92
wow your bad English is an

6003.239 --> 6010.239
argument you should learn that the Earth

6006.44 --> 6013.5199999999995
is a spere in third class in school oh

6010.239 --> 6017.0
my God you are Shan Hawkins aren't

6013.52 --> 6017.0
you what a

6018.0 --> 6022.96
dumbass no of course he can't answer the

6020.599 --> 6022.96
question

6024.52 --> 6031.1990000000005
like he can barely tell the difference

6027.56 --> 6031.1990000000005
between his hands and his ass

6031.76 --> 6037.84
cheeks is a regurgitating dumbass I mean

6035.8 --> 6041.0
that's kind of obvious by now duper it's

6037.84 --> 6043.88
no point in trying to like get some kind

6041.0 --> 6047.119
of conversation out of him that's not

6043.88 --> 6049.52
just him spting his

6047.119 --> 6052.5199999999995
nonsense and delusions that have no

6049.52 --> 6056.400000000001
Foundations at all no argument to back

6052.52 --> 6060.92
him at all he's not going to do

6056.4 --> 6063.679
that you'll take the one little ad home

6060.92 --> 6065.719
thing that you said to him and then

6063.679 --> 6068.32
start whining and complaining about that

6065.719 --> 6071.2390000000005
and then doing that because you gave him

6068.32 --> 6072.96
that one little atom in between your

6071.239 --> 6074.36
actual argumentation he's now going to

6072.96 --> 6077.639
make it all about that because that's

6074.36 --> 6080.96
what they do they're numpty [ __ ]

6077.639 --> 6082.92
that don't have arguments they just

6080.96 --> 6085.679
whining and complaining and trying to

6082.92 --> 6089.1990000000005
peer pressure the [ __ ] out of everybody

6085.679 --> 6094.2390000000005
cuz they're too weak to let go of their

6089.199 --> 6097.239
conditioning of lies that are provably

6094.239 --> 6099.799999999999
lies and that they can't handle and they

6097.239 --> 6101.598999999999
can't leave it alone either right I mean

6099.8 --> 6103.52
they really believe it's such a b though

6101.599 --> 6106.719
what the [ __ ] are you doing here you

6103.52 --> 6109.1990000000005
[ __ ] why are you here in this show

6106.719 --> 6111.679
like who cares if you're so damn right

6109.199 --> 6113.678999999999
about your damn ball who cares about

6111.679 --> 6117.4400000000005
some guy on the

6113.679 --> 6120.88
internet like with barely any

6202.159 --> 6207.04
out oh this technology that technology

6204.599 --> 6210.52
nothing about it proves the Earth is a

6207.04 --> 6213.239
globe nothing and most of those things

6210.52 --> 6216.1990000000005
are completely

6213.239 --> 6219.32
fictional yeah satellites are fictional

6216.199 --> 6223.159
there's no satellites in the

6219.32 --> 6226.92
sky yeah there's some satoon provably

6223.159 --> 6229.679
even in the news H yeah but those

6226.92 --> 6235.28
supposed satellite imagery you get to

6229.679 --> 6238.36
see guess what 100% of them are

6235.28 --> 6241.32
CGI yeah and they even just mostly say

6238.36 --> 6243.92
it in the pictures says oh here's a nice

6241.32 --> 6245.759999999999

yeah yeah they tell you how it's

6245.76 --> 6249.84
supposed to look and it can make it look

really compelling and beautiful and like

6249.84 --> 6255.0
oh it's so good to believe in space it's

6251.639 --> 6257.400000000001
so more real than stupid flatter Earth

6255.0 --> 6262.599
reality yeah but they're all CGI

don't no you

6276.4 --> 6281.44
don't CU every time anybody says

6279.36 --> 6284.04
anything about that the only thing you

do is just whine about it and say you're

6284.04 --> 6287.159
wrong you're wrong oh really so you

backing and some bunch of adom about oh

6296.88 --> 6301.159000000001
you should have learned it was a ball in

6298.28 --> 6302.92
school like the [ __ ] is wrong with you

lunatic if you're really right about

your ball Earth you're a [ __ ] lunatic

6314.639 --> 6317.0
doing

6318.159 --> 6324.32
this as I said

6321.28 --> 6327.5199999999995
it presupposing you're at the right end

6324.32 --> 6330.239
here if that would be the case you are

6327.52 --> 6333.159000000001
effectively going to a mental

incorrectness and your foolishness and

6362.96 --> 6368.04
your false

6365.44 --> 6370.44
confidence that you all derive from your

anymore I

6869.8 --> 6876.8
know just GE never played one Landing

6873.599 --> 6879.32
must be tough it's impossible and you

6876.8 --> 6881.119000000001
can't do a flight simulator on a with a

6879.32 --> 6884.0
globe it doesn't

6881.119 --> 6886.44
work because can't get the physics to

6884.0 --> 6888.52
work there is no flight simulator with

6886.44 --> 6893.239
the globe it's all on a flat Earth all

6888.52 --> 6896.88
of it always has been since the

6893.239 --> 6899.119
80s since flight simulator 1 where it's

6896.88 --> 6903.159000000001
vector graphics guess what that looked

6899.119 --> 6905.839999999999
like a flat

6903.159 --> 6908.5199999999995
plane that's the first flight simulator

6905.84 --> 6910.88
no Graphics is just a flat plane you're

6908.52 --> 6914.2390000000005
in an airplane over a flat plane that's

6910.88 --> 6917.639
flight simulator 1 didn't look like

6914.239 --> 6921.598999999999
anything but it was over a flat plane

6917.639 --> 6921.599
though definitely not over

6931.8 --> 6936.84
Globe hav hold yeah he's not going to

6934.96 --> 6939.56
you can shove it up his ass like he's

6936.84 --> 6939.56
not welcome here

6939.719 --> 6946.2390000000005
anymore yeah and people are going to

6942.599 --> 6948.400000000001
[ __ ] around like oh no I am this I am

6946.239 --> 6951.4
that to back up an argument that they

6948.4 --> 6954.92
refuse to provide I know they're a liar

6951.4 --> 6957.96
now they make up [ __ ] about their own

6954.92 --> 6960.76
background and you're

6957.96 --> 6963.2390000000005

not going to do

6970.88 --> 6977.599

6973.92 --> 6979.96
should be arrested for the such lies

6977.599 --> 6982.04
like what if some idiot actually leave

6979.96 --> 6985.4
that guy and got him as a pilot you

6982.04 --> 6988.679
could literally endanger those people's

6985.4 --> 6991.4
lives yeah a ballart should never be

6988.679 --> 6994.04
behind the steering wheel of an airplane

6991.4 --> 6996.239
cuz they will literally drive it into

6994.04 --> 6996.239

7064.44 --> 7067.4
literally

7068.4 --> 7071.4

7153.32 --> 7157.759999999999
shouldn't but I'm still doing it also

7156.119 --> 7160.44
because

7157.76 --> 7163.639
well I wouldn't know how to get around

7160.44 --> 7163.638999999999
without support

7211.4 --> 7217.5599999999995
problem hello I appreciate your

7214.56 --> 7220.719
commentary and your support but like I

7217.56 --> 7223.4400000000005

7220.719 --> 7223.44
Joe's been

7226.639 --> 7232.2390000000005
great they don't got a lie yeah I know

7239.679 --> 7245.1990000000005
that what I shouldn't be reminding them

7242.32 --> 7248.44
that they have no life yeah I do because

7245.199 --> 7250.96
that's what I do I have to do that it's

7248.44 --> 7254.4
the truth it's what I do if I don't do

7250.96 --> 7257.4800000000005
it then God will curse me death into

7254.4 --> 7261.679
death I do it I speak the truth I will

7257.48 --> 7261.678999999999
not stop doing it even if it gets me

7264.239 --> 7269.119
killed I will speak the truth until the

7266.56 --> 7269.119000000001
end of my

7272.44 --> 7277.96
days and if that makes some people very

7275.119 --> 7279.639
uncomfortable well then get the [ __ ] out

7277.96 --> 7281.719
of here then

7279.639 --> 7283.679
yeah you can't handle me you can't

7281.719 --> 7285.639
handle it then you shouldn't even be

7283.679 --> 7289.159
here watching why the [ __ ] are you here

7285.639 --> 7289.159000000001

7289.36 --> 7296.0
nuts they live only to harm

7292.239 --> 7296.0
yeah yeah and that's

7297.119 --> 7304.0
reciprocal yeah the truth it hurts yeah

7300.92 --> 7307.56
well then get away dumbass oh you can't

7304.0 --> 7310.679
well then prepare to be hurting a

7307.56 --> 7313.0
lot cuz I ain't going to stop just

7310.679 --> 7315.36
because you can't stop getting over here

7313.0 --> 7318.079
and watching this if you can't help

7315.36 --> 7320.679
yourself well then I'm not going to help

7318.079 --> 7322.96
myself I'm not going to help myself to

7320.679 --> 7322.96
stop

7325.28 --> 7331.92
it be strong go on yeah of course I am

7328.96 --> 7334.76
but I mean I will be honest about when I

7331.92 --> 7338.76
have issues if I have instabilities and

7334.76 --> 7341.159000000001
I do have that it's part of my package I

7338.76 --> 7344.400000000001
have to deal with it if I try to hide it

7341.159 --> 7346.598999999999
it's only going to go worse I will have

7344.4 --> 7350.32
less control over myself and then I will

7346.599 --> 7353.84
be less capable to remain honest I must

7350.32 --> 7355.36
be honest including if I'm weakened yeah

7353.84 --> 7358.639
if I

7355.36 --> 7361.04
show honestly when I'm weakened that's

7358.639 --> 7364.52
the only way I can be

7361.04 --> 7367.96
stronger soon as you start to hide it

7364.52 --> 7370.96
then it has power over

7367.96 --> 7370.96
you

7374.119 --> 7378.799999999999
we strong I try to help yeah yeah yeah

7377.28 --> 7381.48
that's

7378.8 --> 7384.1990000000005
cool I I appreciate

7381.48 --> 7387.4
that and I appreciate your support I

7384.199 --> 7389.759999999999
really need it I mean we are financially

7387.4 --> 7391.679
in a [ __ ] hole right now it's terrible

7389.76 --> 7395.679
it's probably might get

7391.679 --> 7397.52
worse just very lucky to have like a

7395.679 --> 7402.679
whole bunch of like lawyers that are

7397.52 --> 7406.280000000001
just working on it and trying to stop

7402.679 --> 7410.1990000000005
the the Communist Empire from literally

7406.28 --> 7413.719
like self-destructing everything

7410.199 --> 7416.199
so what brings them down better than

7413.719 --> 7419.08
right well I do it out of self-defense I

7416.199 --> 7421.199
do it out of necessity

7419.08 --> 7424.0
[Music]

7421.199 --> 7426.799999999999
though but thank you Steven Jarvis I

7424.0 --> 7430.88
appreciate that welcome back by the way

7426.8 --> 7430.88
I know you were banned

7431.23 --> 7434.879999999999
[Music]

7433.48 --> 7436.638999999999
right but I am actually going to

7434.88 --> 7439.679
continue rounding out the show though

7436.639 --> 7441.84
now so anyway it was a late show very

7439.679 --> 7444.52
late

7441.84 --> 7446.8
show got very inspired in the beginning

7444.52 --> 7448.079000000001
that's why there's like Aran and Lucifer

7446.8 --> 7452.92
in the

7448.079 --> 7452.92
title and then later dealt with the

7453.0 --> 7460.8
balard

7455.4 --> 7460.799999999999
right some don't know what

7461.4 --> 7464.48
some people don't know in the

7462.52 --> 7466.159000000001
Netherlands you mean about what's going

7464.48 --> 7468.36
on well that's because they are hiding

7466.159 --> 7469.759999999999
their heads in the sand though Dutch

7468.36 --> 7472.04
people do that

7469.76 --> 7473.360000000001
too they can't handle the truth they

7472.04 --> 7475.719
just want to keep going they want to be

7473.36 --> 7478.44
able to be stable to do a jobs and keep

7475.719 --> 7480.719
going as everything is like being torn

7478.44 --> 7483.079
down around

7480.719 --> 7485.559
them that is

7483.079 --> 7487.36
true I used to be one of those people

7485.559 --> 7489.599
until I realized if I keep this up then

7487.36 --> 7492.119
I'll literally sacrifice my life for

7489.599 --> 7496.28
absolutely nothing only for ignorance

7492.119 --> 7498.799999999999
I'll die for my ignorance and I refuse

7496.28 --> 7501.8
to

7498.8 --> 7504.119000000001
so and hopefully I'll be able to inspire

7501.8 --> 7507.599
some other people in the Netherlands to

7504.119 --> 7510.598999999999
do that and who knows what will happen

7507.599 --> 7513.4800000000005
maybe it will amount to a very violent

7510.599 --> 7513.4800000000005
revolution in the

7514.119 --> 7521.839999999999
end or not or we will able be able to

7518.119 --> 7521.839999999999
contain it and not get fooled

7522.599 --> 7527.639
again I don't know with certainty I

7525.559 --> 7531.0
never got to see it in the Dark World

7527.639 --> 7534.96
they never showed it to me cuz they

7531.0 --> 7538.0
wanted me to be in anguish

7534.96 --> 7539.159
forever they didn't show me that part I

7538.0 --> 7542.48
don't

7539.159 --> 7547.119
know maybe it's necessary to not know to

7542.48 --> 7547.119
actually stay invested enough as I

7547.679 --> 7550.679
am

7551.36 --> 7556.639
it's just that I know we overcome all

7553.8 --> 7560.4400000000005
obstacles I just don't know if we like

7556.639 --> 7561.76
really get to a final solution that it

7560.44 --> 7564.719
stops

7561.76 --> 7567.719
happening I don't

7564.719 --> 7570.32
know maybe we are no longer in a

7567.719 --> 7572.679
position where we can reach that maybe

7570.32 --> 7576.079
we are permanently in this

7572.679 --> 7578.0
struggle with those people and it'll

7576.079 --> 7579.679
never end until the end of time I don't

7578.0 --> 7581.239
know

7579.679 --> 7584.0
I can't

7581.239 --> 7587.04
tell I just know that I'm going to say

7584.0 --> 7589.8
everything truthfully and I'm not going

7587.04 --> 7593.32
to be fooled by this [ __ ] and I'm not

7589.8 --> 7595.400000000001
going to be demoralized into giving up

7593.32 --> 7598.28
and being fooled

7595.4 --> 7600.679
again it's not going to happen anyway

7598.28 --> 7602.679
right so continuing rounding out the

7600.679 --> 7604.32
show or I'll just start over again

7602.679 --> 7605.92
