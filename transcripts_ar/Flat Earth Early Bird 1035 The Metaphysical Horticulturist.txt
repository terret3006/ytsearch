91.04 --> 96.07900000000001
weather is

92.799 --> 96.07900000000001
quite beautiful right now

96.32 --> 101.75899999999999
very little clouds

98.56 --> 104.799
although some and there's been a lot of

101.759 --> 104.799
trails up there

105.6 --> 110.55999999999999
although some of it seems to be

107.759 --> 113.36
dissipating already

110.56 --> 116.799
but it was like an entire web of trails

113.36 --> 116.799
up there this morning

120.079 --> 124.32
they haven't truly been able to stop the

122.96 --> 128.47899999999998
sun

124.32 --> 130.07999999999998
which is shining bright and warm and

128.479 --> 133.92000000000002
there's very little wind so it's

130.08 --> 136.56
actually quite pleasant outside

133.92 --> 137.51999999999998
in contrast yesterday when it was

136.56 --> 140.08
raining

137.52 --> 143.12
almost the entire day

140.08 --> 147.04000000000002
oh you see there's still spraying

143.12 --> 147.04
there's one coming right over there

155.12 --> 157.84
let's see that

158.16 --> 161.239
all right

176.0 --> 180.959
all right so hello america silver

178.8 --> 182.64000000000001
patriot first in chat

180.959 --> 186.8
daniel rublers

182.64 --> 186.79999999999998
rubbles sorry terminoid

187.44 --> 194.879
smell fresh of chem no i don't know if

190.08 --> 194.87900000000002
it's chemtrails it's a trail terminoid

195.12 --> 199.31900000000002
i don't know what they're spraying

201.599 --> 206.319
it does seem to be involved in the

203.64 --> 208.23899999999998
geoengineering process but

206.319 --> 210.83999999999997
doesn't mean that it's all

208.239 --> 216.239
bad chemicals because that

210.84 --> 216.239
would over time have significant

216.879 --> 220.159
toxic influences

220.64 --> 224.48
and i don't think that's going on

224.72 --> 227.84
not over here anyway

229.84 --> 235.599
so that's why i just call them trails

233.599 --> 236.959
there's trails being left and they hang

235.599 --> 239.67999999999998
around and they

236.959 --> 242.48
wave out like feathers

239.68 --> 244.959
but i don't know what kind of substances

242.48 --> 244.959
they are

248.4 --> 254.0
but it's not moist because that would

251.12 --> 256.72
like contrails specifically disappear

254.0 --> 256.72
very quickly

256.88 --> 261.28
and these things don't whatever they are

258.959 --> 262.4
oh wait

261.28 --> 263.84
oh look

262.4 --> 266.88
all right

263.84 --> 268.479
see like that one like that one

266.88 --> 270.56
the one that came

268.479 --> 273.03999999999996
that i tried to point at earlier

270.56 --> 276.56
that one is not leaving a trail

273.04 --> 280.16
that's a contrail guaranteed see because

276.56 --> 283.6
not too far behind it it's all gone

280.16 --> 286.47900000000004
no remnant whatsoever

283.6 --> 290.04
so that's a calm trail for sure

286.479 --> 290.03999999999996
that's just moist

296.88 --> 300.32
i don't know if the webcam could pick

298.479 --> 304.32
that up

300.32 --> 304.32
too well but anyway i tried

309.28 --> 312.88
hello mike zedunich

316.24 --> 322.68
it is thursday the 7th

318.88 --> 322.68
of october 2021

322.88 --> 329.6
what a beautiful day for in october

327.039 --> 329.59999999999997
i like it

330.32 --> 334.08
it's a bit of a back and forth switch or

333.039 --> 336.479
roof

334.08 --> 337.35999999999996
beautiful sunny days and then

336.479 --> 338.479
just

337.36 --> 340.8
rainy

338.479 --> 342.56
gray days

340.8 --> 346.56
but hey as long as we still get those

342.56 --> 346.56
sunny days in between i'm all good

349.68 --> 357.6
uh so yeah i started late yet today

353.28 --> 357.59999999999997
because i got up late as in

358.24 --> 363.12
half to 12

360.16 --> 363.12
half past 12.

364.8 --> 371.039
that's i i just needed to rest

368.24 --> 374.479
i tried to not go to bed late again but

371.039 --> 377.44
i also had dinner like past 12 which is

374.479 --> 379.52
a terrible idea

377.44 --> 381.44
but that's what happens when you start

379.52 --> 382.71999999999997
playing a video game and then it's like

381.44 --> 384.56
ah

382.72 --> 388.40000000000003

450.4 --> 456.88
two half streams yesterday and watched

453.28 --> 456.88

458.0 --> 460.96
so he never did an official tuesday

460.08 --> 462.96
stream

460.96 --> 465.599
seems

462.96 --> 468.0
but anyway

465.599 --> 470.0
it's interesting also i was just now

468.0 --> 473.039
watching

470.0 --> 473.039
made by jim bob

473.36 --> 478.8

503.68 --> 508.0

510.319 --> 515.76
youtube

512.08 --> 515.76
and to people sharing the link

515.919 --> 521.8389999999999
and hopefully

517.919 --> 521.8389999999999
they'll carry me through

524.399 --> 527.839
all right what else is going

532.839 --> 538.6400000000001
on right i think i missed mitchell from

535.839 --> 538.6400000000001
australia again

541.76 --> 545.279
i think i was

543.44 --> 549.839
like playing the game

545.279 --> 549.8389999999999
having info wars on in the background

556.08 --> 560.12
though seeking star wars

562.959 --> 566.04

581.6 --> 584.64
yeah you're inland

585.68 --> 590.04
in mountainous regions right

591.68 --> 595.399
sounds about right

609.6 --> 612.6
ah

621.6 --> 623.9200000000001
right

624.88 --> 629.2
i'm still kind of in the middle of

626.32 --> 629.2
trying to wake up

630.64 --> 636.079
takes a while

633.68 --> 640.8
oh by the way i finally

636.079 --> 644.4799999999999
surpassed the the 240 mark

640.8 --> 646.4799999999999
it's kind of hang going back and forth

644.48 --> 648.9590000000001
between like 32

646.48 --> 651.2
and 40. now it's at 43 for the first

be a lot of new subscribers just

656.56 --> 661.56
getting in here

657.92 --> 661.56
so that's interesting

662.72 --> 666.399
okay let me see what did i

666.64 --> 670.04
liked videos

675.68 --> 679.7199999999999
no that's not

688.16 --> 690.399
uh

691.2 --> 694.6400000000001
huh

692.56 --> 696.4799999999999
i really didn't hang around too much in

694.64 --> 699.72
youtube yesterday

696.48 --> 699.72
oh well

704.24 --> 710.24
a cup of coffee is a must for you in the

706.399 --> 712.399
morning okay kopo no

710.24 --> 714.72
5150

712.399 --> 716.56
hello stone monkey 3d

714.72 --> 720.8000000000001
yeah i get a cup of coffee too in the

716.56 --> 720.8
morning i already finished mine

721.04 --> 727.56
pretty much before the show started

724.56 --> 727.56
ugh

730.88 --> 734.279
oh man

745.12 --> 751.36
yeah i feel a little stiff

748.079 --> 751.3599999999999
that'll go away i'm sure

754.56 --> 759.8389999999999
like once the supplements i took really

757.12 --> 759.839
get going

762.0 --> 765.92
that just got in my system

764.16 --> 769.68
i literally

765.92 --> 769.68
just woke up an hour ago so

771.76 --> 776.959
anyway i'll still have one and a half

774.24 --> 778.88
hour show

776.959 --> 782.0
and we'll see

778.88 --> 782.0
what it's gonna be about

782.079 --> 787.8389999999999
at least i got plenty of people in chat

784.32 --> 787.839
pretty quickly that's nice

790.8 --> 796.8389999999999
so what are you guys gals all up to

801.76 --> 805.0
let's see

823.92 --> 828.76
on the lunch break

825.6 --> 828.76
all right

839.36 --> 846.16
pushing the

840.839 --> 846.1600000000001
j the v hard in your area oh that sucks

849.12 --> 855.88
right but

851.04 --> 855.88
besides them pushing it

856.56 --> 860.6389999999999
can you still get around not taking it

860.72 --> 863.0400000000001
i mean

865.36 --> 870.48
lots of areas around the world where

867.519 --> 872.399
it's highly promoted and suggested

870.48 --> 874.16
everywhere

872.399 --> 876.399
they're still just

874.16 --> 879.199
if you completely step out of it and

876.399 --> 881.279
just don't go all aggro on it every

879.199 --> 883.199
single time

881.279 --> 885.4399999999999
but just avoid it

883.199 --> 887.68
you can still just get around fine it's

885.44 --> 891.12
almost like it stops existing to you

887.68 --> 895.2399999999999
that's how i've been living

891.12 --> 895.24
pretty much since this started

898.72 --> 903.36
won't be able to buy oh really how do

900.72 --> 903.36
you know that

905.44 --> 909.7600000000001
there's there's nobody

908.0 --> 912.959
that's willing to step

909.76 --> 917.0
outside of that

912.959 --> 917.0
there's no farmers around

927.76 --> 932.72
it's not after curve oh there's curfew

930.0 --> 934.079
too yeah we we had that for a while here

932.72 --> 936.72
in the netherlands

934.079 --> 939.3599999999999
but it didn't bother me whatsoever

936.72 --> 942.24
because i really don't go out

939.36 --> 942.24
late anyway

946.24 --> 951.6
but it did agitate a whole bunch of

948.24 --> 953.199
people especially young people

951.6 --> 956.48
that like to

953.199 --> 956.4799999999999
spook around at night

958.88 --> 967.0
go to parties all that

961.36 --> 967.0
but that curfew ended like last year

970.639 --> 974.399
did it

972.48 --> 976.399
and somewhere earlier this year i don't

974.399 --> 977.68
know i haven't really kept track of

976.399 --> 981.199
exactly

977.68 --> 983.279
when something got into

981.199 --> 985.199
the rule system and when it got out

983.279 --> 986.72
again because that's just like a

985.199 --> 988.8
separate game

986.72 --> 991.36
and again i ignore

988.8 --> 993.04
literally everything

991.36 --> 995.519
so that's why it's not even important

993.04 --> 998.48
for my system to keep careful track of

995.519 --> 1000.079
oh we're not supposed to do this oh i

998.48 --> 1003.36
don't care

1000.079 --> 1005.7589999999999
because i just do what i do

1003.36 --> 1007.519
i'm not going out of my way to try and

1005.759 --> 1011.519
break the rules

1007.519 --> 1016.16
but i'm not going to try to

1011.519 --> 1016.16
like avoid all of that either

1016.88 --> 1020.079
i'm just gonna do what i do

1020.399 --> 1024.04
and it works great

1045.12 --> 1050.32
so yeah it all depends

1047.679 --> 1052.4
if you accept oh we can't buy groceries

1050.32 --> 1054.6399999999999
anymore if you're going to

1052.4 --> 1058.799
conjure that in your head

1054.64 --> 1060.72
as a doom that's approaching yeah then

1058.799 --> 1063.12
you have a problem but if you just

1060.72 --> 1066.799
realize how is this happening how is

1063.12 --> 1068.559
that being enforced

1066.799 --> 1071.76
by which routes

1068.559 --> 1072.799
which individuals are actually

1071.76 --> 1075.28
causing

1072.799 --> 1078.0
that to unfold like that

1075.28 --> 1081.28
then you can bypass it and you don't

1078.0 --> 1083.28
have to just conjure in your mind oh no

1081.28 --> 1085.36
at some point we won't be able to get

1083.28 --> 1088.16
groceries

1085.36 --> 1090.08
you just have to understand

1088.16 --> 1091.28
how is that happening

1090.08 --> 1093.28
and then

1091.28 --> 1096.32
look out for people that are basically

1093.28 --> 1100.799
willing to sidestep the whole thing

1096.32 --> 1100.799
even like well operators of

1100.88 --> 1104.88
companies or grocery stores right

1106.24 --> 1111.1200000000001
i'd almost

1108.64 --> 1113.44
if yeah if i had the energy and the

1111.12 --> 1116.559
opportunity

1113.44 --> 1118.559
like try to get to know the the owner

1116.559 --> 1120.3999999999999
and see where they're at with their mind

1118.559 --> 1122.3999999999999
and see what their priorities are if

1120.4 --> 1125.039
they are like

1122.4 --> 1128.799
if they are conjuring that they have to

1125.039 --> 1130.16
basically enforce these passports

1128.799 --> 1132.0
supposedly

1130.16 --> 1134.72
because then you have a problem because

1132.0 --> 1137.52
it's all about the owners what they do

1134.72 --> 1140.799
it like the whole v situation it's

1137.52 --> 1142.96
really a corporate scam actually

1140.799 --> 1145.36
practically that's where it's all coming

1142.96 --> 1146.4
from that's because they can't enforce

1145.36 --> 1148.84
it

1146.4 --> 1150.64
it's all

1148.84 --> 1152.72
monopoly

1150.64 --> 1155.2
and mind control based

1152.72 --> 1155.2
all of it

1156.24 --> 1159.76
so if you just don't be part of it

1158.72 --> 1161.76
then

1159.76 --> 1164.76
you can just still

1161.76 --> 1164.76
trade

1171.12 --> 1175.7199999999998
all right mike's doing itch good for you

1181.919 --> 1185.44
okay kapono

1184.4 --> 1187.44
well

1185.44 --> 1189.039
if you do that i wish you the best of

1187.44 --> 1190.4
luck you might want to keep it to

1189.039 --> 1194.96
yourself because

1190.4 --> 1194.96
well technically that's sort of illegal

1202.72 --> 1207.44
like i'd go

1204.32 --> 1209.76
i i personally try not to falsify like

1207.44 --> 1211.2
the corporate scam papers

1209.76 --> 1215.039
instead

1211.2 --> 1215.039
i would try to basically

1215.76 --> 1221.52
give medical declaration like yeah i

1218.64 --> 1223.919
can't take the v

1221.52 --> 1225.2
because my system would not be able to

1223.919 --> 1228.48
handle that

1225.2 --> 1229.3600000000001
and i have like natural immunity

1228.48 --> 1232.0
right

1229.36 --> 1234.559
that like if you can basically give a

1232.0 --> 1237.2
good solid argument

1234.559 --> 1239.44
from medical grounds

1237.2 --> 1240.72
then i think you should be able to avoid

1239.44 --> 1243.3600000000001
the whole

1240.72 --> 1245.919
vp

1243.36 --> 1247.9189999999999
situation

1245.919 --> 1249.76
not entirely sure though like if they're

1247.919 --> 1250.96
still going to be like thoughts that are

1249.76 --> 1253.679
just not

1250.96 --> 1257.679
that are just trying to

1253.679 --> 1257.679
ram it into everybody that's different

1260.88 --> 1266.5590000000002
but judicially i think there's many ways

1264.24 --> 1270.88
around this because it is all a

1266.559 --> 1273.6789999999999
corporate scam it's not really

1270.88 --> 1276.4
law or government it's corporate scam

1273.679 --> 1278.48
all of it

1276.4 --> 1280.24
and there's just this image like it's

1278.48 --> 1281.84
government

1280.24 --> 1283.84
like the government is basically

1281.84 --> 1285.28
cooperating on many fronts many

1283.84 --> 1289.8799999999999
different governments

1285.28 --> 1289.8799999999999
are cooperating with the scam

1290.159 --> 1295.3600000000001
of money interests

1292.32 --> 1296.8799999999999
and complex deals

1295.36 --> 1301.36
that kind of like

1296.88 --> 1304.0800000000002
demand their cooperation in order to

1301.36 --> 1306.9599999999998
go through with things and all that it's

1304.08 --> 1308.72
yeah it's it's a corporate scam it's a

1306.96 --> 1312.08
conspiracy

1308.72 --> 1314.559
can't get more conspiracy

1312.08 --> 1317.72
than this thing

1314.559 --> 1317.72
in reality

1318.72 --> 1322.799
i'm really feeling like alex jones but

1320.799 --> 1325.36
like 20 years later like it's all

1322.799 --> 1327.36
corporate conspiracy it's not really a

1325.36 --> 1329.36
government conspiracy

1327.36 --> 1331.52
it's more corporate conspiracy and hey

1329.36 --> 1333.6
government can

1331.52 --> 1336.4
have corrupted people in them if they

1333.6 --> 1338.3999999999999
are corporate conspirators

1336.4 --> 1341.6000000000001
then they will

1338.4 --> 1343.039
kind of like use the government

1341.6 --> 1345.28
as a shield

1343.039 --> 1346.559
and then even make people believe it's

1345.28 --> 1349.36
the government instead of the

1346.559 --> 1352.3999999999999
corporations that are enforcing it

1349.36 --> 1355.12
to likening rod away from the corporate

1352.4 --> 1356.88
conspirators

1355.12 --> 1358.799
make everybody angry at the government

1356.88 --> 1362.4
instead and this is something that owen

1358.799 --> 1362.4
benjamin has seen through

1362.799 --> 1367.6
for a while and he's been like really

1365.2 --> 1370.559
clearing that up more and more and i'm

1367.6 --> 1373.28
i'm starting to get that

1370.559 --> 1375.84
really get that picture

1373.28 --> 1378.72
and i totally agree it's very difficult

1375.84 --> 1380.48
because we're all used to that like yeah

1378.72 --> 1383.1200000000001
it's the government the government's

1380.48 --> 1386.799
problem but hold on what's really going

1383.12 --> 1391.12
on here that's not really the government

1386.799 --> 1391.12
it's a bunch of corporation heads

1391.6 --> 1399.12
that are everywhere

1394.559 --> 1401.28
they're a giant gaggle of conspirators

1399.12 --> 1404.1589999999999
and they don't give a [ __ ] they just

1401.28 --> 1408.559
want power control money

1404.159 --> 1408.5590000000002
and they have no more morality

1415.76 --> 1421.28
how would i cope if i caught the bug

1418.32 --> 1421.28
there is no bug

1421.52 --> 1425.44
and

1423.36 --> 1430.1999999999998
yeah

1425.44 --> 1430.2
how do why would i cope uh

1430.96 --> 1436.0
get some chicken soup

1432.88 --> 1436.0
have a good night's sleep

1437.36 --> 1440.7199999999998
get some vitamin c

1441.279 --> 1446.88
and this is for after you catch it right

1445.039 --> 1448.96
and then yeah the next day it should be

1446.88 --> 1451.0390000000002
all good maybe

1448.96 --> 1453.3600000000001
if yeah if you've got some things

1451.039 --> 1455.6
waiting on you it might take a half a

1453.36 --> 1458.7199999999998
week oh no now you got like a cold half

1455.6 --> 1461.36
a week maybe some breathing trouble

1458.72 --> 1463.3600000000001
oh no

1461.36 --> 1465.1999999999998
sorry it

1463.36 --> 1467.9189999999999
who gives a [ __ ]

1465.2 --> 1471.24
that's normal that sort of stuff happens

1467.919 --> 1471.24
every year

1484.4 --> 1489.8400000000001
i'll do anything not to get the jab okay

1487.679 --> 1491.039
just don't do something that's worse

1489.84 --> 1494.6399999999999
instead

1491.039 --> 1497.039
kapono five one oh five oh

1494.64 --> 1498.5590000000002
no i'm just gonna call you a cabana

1497.039 --> 1502.96
right

1498.559 --> 1502.96
don't be led around by the fear

1503.36 --> 1508.0
because you might be tricked into doing

1505.2 --> 1508.0
something worse

1513.36 --> 1517.6
right don't let them

1515.279 --> 1520.08
give you false dichotomy choices for

1517.6 --> 1520.08
example

1521.2 --> 1525.52
you have to dig your way through you

1523.2 --> 1527.919
have to

1525.52 --> 1530.559
find the choices you're gonna make don't

1527.919 --> 1530.5590000000002
let them

1531.84 --> 1535.3999999999999
do it for you

1542.159 --> 1548.5590000000002
some people end up in yeah well

1544.64 --> 1551.279
who the hell goes to a freaking hospital

1548.559 --> 1554.72
when you got a cold like who the

1551.279 --> 1554.72
it's so stupid

1554.96 --> 1559.3600000000001
since when

1556.72 --> 1562.24
do people panic when they get a cold or

1559.36 --> 1565.279
the flu it's so pathetic

1562.24 --> 1567.279
like i'm truly embarrassed

1565.279 --> 1570.24
that people do that

1567.279 --> 1571.919
like why the hell would you do that like

1570.24 --> 1573.44
i got colds

1571.919 --> 1576.64
and flu

1573.44 --> 1580.159
plenty of times almost every year when i

1576.64 --> 1583.3600000000001
was a kid even we never went to the

1580.159 --> 1584.64
doctor i never even considered going to

1583.36 --> 1587.039
the doctor

1584.64 --> 1590.48
it's just the flu

1587.039 --> 1593.52
i know what to do you never

1590.48 --> 1596.4
ever go to the hospital for that unless

1593.52 --> 1598.96
oh god super comorbidity [ __ ] like oh

1596.4 --> 1601.3600000000001
you just got out of an operation and

1598.96 --> 1605.1200000000001
in the recovery process

1601.36 --> 1607.76
get and then you get the flu okay okay i

1605.12 --> 1610.08
get it that's dangerous right

1607.76 --> 1612.48
then you have comorbidities yeah that's

1610.08 --> 1614.6399999999999
dangerous that can happen

1612.48 --> 1617.279
i'm not in that situation

1614.64 --> 1619.3600000000001
there's no reason for me to be worried

1617.279 --> 1621.84
whatsoever

1619.36 --> 1624.6399999999999
for getting the flu or a cold

1621.84 --> 1628.559
whatsoever

1624.64 --> 1628.5590000000002
it's very simple to treat this

1629.36 --> 1633.6789999999999
just never

1630.72 --> 1636.32
ever go to the hospital unless it's like

1633.679 --> 1636.3200000000002
a really

1636.64 --> 1641.1200000000001
dangerous situation

1638.96 --> 1642.08
like you can feel like oh god you're

1641.12 --> 1644.0
gonna

1642.08 --> 1645.6789999999999
actually choke

1644.0 --> 1647.039
or

1645.679 --> 1648.799
buckle

1647.039 --> 1651.279
physically or get a heart attack or

1648.799 --> 1654.1589999999999
something but here's the issue

1651.279 --> 1656.799
even if with that you on your own go to

1654.159 --> 1660.3990000000001
the hospital you risk then actually just

1656.799 --> 1660.399
getting intubated and dying

1660.799 --> 1663.679
see

1661.919 --> 1665.3600000000001
that's the whole problem it could be

1663.679 --> 1668.64
treated if

1665.36 --> 1670.399
you know what to ask for but then you

1668.64 --> 1673.1200000000001
must basically while you're in a

1670.399 --> 1675.279
weakened state fight for your life very

1673.12 --> 1677.36
conscious and sometimes even like slap

1675.279 --> 1678.799
people away like get away from me get

1677.36 --> 1681.36
away from me

1678.799 --> 1683.279
i'm not doing that get you must fight

1681.36 --> 1685.039
for your life

1683.279 --> 1686.72
if you're in that kind of condition and

1685.039 --> 1689.12
you end up in the hospital because they

1686.72 --> 1691.1200000000001
just might freaking drug you intubate

1689.12 --> 1694.8799999999999
you and then you die

1691.12 --> 1694.8799999999999
right but if you can

1695.6 --> 1700.24
like if you're in a situation where you

1697.6 --> 1702.08
have comorbidity dangers

1700.24 --> 1706.159
and you get the flu because you just got

1702.08 --> 1706.96
out of an operation or something right

1706.159 --> 1708.159
then

1706.96 --> 1711.159
ask for

1708.159 --> 1711.159
i

1711.52 --> 1714.6399999999999
the

1713.12 --> 1718.4799999999998
horse dewormer

1714.64 --> 1720.96
invented in japan because that one

1718.48 --> 1723.2
is actually very safe

1720.96 --> 1725.8400000000001
specifically for that kind of condition

1723.2 --> 1728.32
like if you have dangerous comorbidity

1725.84 --> 1732.32
situation there's no

1728.32 --> 1734.559
dangerous procedures you just take it

1732.32 --> 1736.799
and then it's you're very likely to pull

1734.559 --> 1736.799
through

1736.88 --> 1744.0800000000002
it's the high chances of success

1740.96 --> 1746.08
with no side effects practically right

1744.08 --> 1748.399
that's from everything i've seen so far

1746.08 --> 1752.08
so that's what i would do but yeah you

1748.399 --> 1753.4399999999998
gotta actually connect to some doctor or

1752.08 --> 1755.279
whatever

1753.44 --> 1758.0800000000002
who knows a veterinarian i don't know

1755.279 --> 1758.88
anything would do pretty much like i is

1758.08 --> 1760.08
i

1758.88 --> 1762.3200000000002
it works

1760.08 --> 1763.4399999999998
rsd wormer is just what it is doesn't

1762.32 --> 1766.1589999999999
really matter if you get it at a

1763.44 --> 1768.3200000000002
veterinarian or from a doctor if it

1766.159 --> 1770.0800000000002
works it works

1768.32 --> 1771.279
just get that

1770.08 --> 1774.08
in

1771.279 --> 1776.159
you could get it preemptively right i've

1774.08 --> 1777.9189999999999
actually thought about like hey it

1776.159 --> 1781.0390000000002
might be good to just have a couple of

1777.919 --> 1784.64
those tablets

1781.039 --> 1787.039
i mean they should last very long

1784.64 --> 1789.2
and then hey maybe i'll get in a crazy

1787.039 --> 1791.2
situation and i could just quickly take

1789.2 --> 1792.559
one i wouldn't even have to go anywhere

1791.2 --> 1796.88
then

1792.559 --> 1796.8799999999999
right so that's my recommendation

1797.84 --> 1804.48
don't worry about it don't panic

1802.159 --> 1804.48
right

1804.559 --> 1810.559
in a mind control spell operation which

1808.0 --> 1812.96
is is that's exactly what is happening

1810.559 --> 1814.24
in the world right now

1812.96 --> 1817.3600000000001
panic

1814.24 --> 1819.2
and obsession with fear are your worst

1817.36 --> 1820.84
enemies

1819.2 --> 1824.799
that's what they're trying

1820.84 --> 1827.279
to make you go towards inside of

1824.799 --> 1829.279
yourself because when you get there

1827.279 --> 1831.44
you blind yourself to a whole bunch of

1829.279 --> 1834.399
things and you're much more likely to

1831.44 --> 1837.3600000000001
start operating in a very subservient

1834.399 --> 1841.12
way automated and that's

1837.36 --> 1843.4399999999998
how the mind control about it works

1841.12 --> 1845.4399999999998
so don't panic

1843.44 --> 1846.48
don't be afraid just

1845.44 --> 1849.52
know

1846.48 --> 1849.52
how to proceed

1849.679 --> 1853.679
when these types of situations arrive

1857.44 --> 1861.919
and then if you have prepared for such

1860.08 --> 1864.0
occasions

1861.919 --> 1866.72
then you don't then there's nothing left

1864.0 --> 1870.279
to panic over it's all right

1866.72 --> 1870.279
you know what to do

1886.48 --> 1893.039
they are in icu because they can yeah

1889.12 --> 1895.039
well if they just gave them eye very

1893.039 --> 1896.559
quickly

1895.039 --> 1898.64
maybe

1896.559 --> 1901.749
i didn't i don't know if you can

1898.64 --> 1901.749
[Music]

1902.24 --> 1907.84
if there's injectables of it for example

1904.88 --> 1910.7990000000002
i don't know i don't know of that but

1907.84 --> 1914.399
that would then work like very quickly

1910.799 --> 1918.32
if that if there is such if it can be

1914.399 --> 1918.32
administered in that form

1918.559 --> 1921.6
done

1920.08 --> 1926.24
look

1921.6 --> 1926.24
and then it should work very rapidly

1926.399 --> 1929.399
just

1945.2 --> 1948.96
okay

1947.279 --> 1952.24
anyway

1948.96 --> 1952.24
hey slow mo moon buggy

1957.6 --> 1961.12
respiratory legends

1961.36 --> 1966.799
yeah slow mo moon buggy it's crazy

1964.399 --> 1966.799
god

1966.96 --> 1969.679
what is that

1973.919 --> 1977.8400000000001
unbelievably noisy

1978.48 --> 1983.3600000000001
yeah the problem is slow mo moon buggy

1980.72 --> 1985.3600000000001
is that there's this crazy corporate

1983.36 --> 1988.7199999999998
conspiracy within the medical system

1985.36 --> 1991.76
where literally there is incentives

1988.72 --> 1995.279
for people to engage in these

1991.76 --> 1998.399
procedures that are not to the benefit

1995.279 --> 1998.399
of the participants

1999.2 --> 2007.3600000000001
like literal big time bonuses

2003.279 --> 2009.6
it's unbelievably evil by the way

2007.36 --> 2011.9189999999999
and that's why you need to have

2009.6 --> 2015.12
basically a man on the inside you can

2011.919 --> 2017.279
trust not to go there with you

2015.12 --> 2018.9599999999998
not to allow you

2017.279 --> 2022.32
as his patient

2018.96 --> 2024.88
her patient to become subjected

2022.32 --> 2024.8799999999999
to that

2024.96 --> 2030.88
eugenics conspiracy

2027.76 --> 2034.799
literally yeah it's like pay to kill

2030.88 --> 2037.7990000000002
and they take cover under just crazy

2034.799 --> 2037.799
procedures

2047.76 --> 2050.159
pressure

2050.879 --> 2054.399
get up

2052.159 --> 2057.639
get up

2054.399 --> 2057.6389999999997
come on

2073.599 --> 2078.2400000000002
oh

2075.839 --> 2078.24
god

2080.079 --> 2086.2400000000002
that literally looks like a

2082.48 --> 2088.48
a biker with a gray long beard

2086.24 --> 2091.359
with a leaf blower i don't know what

2088.48 --> 2094.839
he's doing here there's no leaves

2091.359 --> 2094.839
this is stupid

2105.04 --> 2109.52
like literally not a single leaf

2108.72 --> 2111.68
it's

2109.52 --> 2114.839
the the leaves haven't dropped yet this

2111.68 --> 2114.839
is [ __ ]

2127.68 --> 2133.2799999999997
ah i think he's finally getting the hell

2130.88 --> 2134.8
out of here

2133.28 --> 2136.6400000000003
good

2134.8 --> 2139.8
yeah

2136.64 --> 2139.7999999999997
all right

2147.119 --> 2149.44
ah

2152.079 --> 2158.8390000000004
that's terrible slow mo moon buggy

2155.839 --> 2158.839
terrible

2160.24 --> 2165.9599999999996
it's almost worse when you see it coming

2162.4 --> 2165.96
and then it happens

2214.56 --> 2222.96
uh really bad karma you're going there

2219.04 --> 2225.52
how did they get why didn't you ask

2222.96 --> 2226.839
the doctors that talk about that how

2225.52 --> 2230.839
that

2226.839 --> 2230.839
happens right

2244.0 --> 2247.0
hmm

2282.839 --> 2289.7599999999998
damn that's ridiculous bad karma

2287.76 --> 2291.44
no it's it's just it's the

2289.76 --> 2295.2000000000003
misapplication

2291.44 --> 2296.96
of the ventilators that's the problem

2295.2 --> 2299.839
like that's not how you're supposed to

2296.96 --> 2299.839
use them

2304.079 --> 2309.6800000000003
like ventilators are for very niche

2306.8 --> 2313.599
situations

2309.68 --> 2314.96
i think that they re and this is

2313.599 --> 2316.1600000000003
yeah i'm not

2314.96 --> 2319.44
a medical

2316.16 --> 2322.3199999999997
detailed expert at this but i am like

2319.44 --> 2324.4
very interested in it

2322.32 --> 2327.2000000000003
i think that they really

2324.4 --> 2330.2400000000002
become kind of a tool that is used

2327.2 --> 2332.3199999999997
like a very serious accident situations

2330.24 --> 2335.52
when

2332.32 --> 2338.079
like literally you are become incapable

2335.52 --> 2340.88
through drugs or through damage like on

2338.079 --> 2342.96
the ribs and stuff or whatever

2340.88 --> 2345.2000000000003
where literally you are incapable of

2342.96 --> 2346.88
breathing and then that machine can do

2345.2 --> 2349.2
it for you

2346.88 --> 2351.28
but that is kind of under the condition

2349.2 --> 2352.3999999999996
that the lungs are intact

2351.28 --> 2355.119
right

2352.4 --> 2357.44
while if you have the

2355.119 --> 2359.28
situation where you have like serious

2357.44 --> 2360.64
pneumonia

2359.28 --> 2364.32
then

2360.64 --> 2366.3199999999997
the lungs are not intact

2364.32 --> 2370.6400000000003
it that's no i don't think they're

2366.32 --> 2370.6400000000003
supposed to be used for that at all

2374.8 --> 2382.1600000000003
if i'm not mistaken i am not an expert

2378.48 --> 2382.96
about these specific procedures though

2382.16 --> 2385.7599999999998
right

2382.96 --> 2387.119
and there's there are experts in this

2385.76 --> 2389.119
out there

2387.119 --> 2393.28
i'd like for example if i had an

2389.119 --> 2394.8
opportunity i'd ask dr timpani

2393.28 --> 2397.6800000000003
like she would know

2394.8 --> 2401.44
and there's plenty other doctors

2397.68 --> 2401.44
like her that would also know this

2401.52 --> 2406.88
the the the details of this i'm

2403.68 --> 2409.44
basically kind of writing off them in

2406.88 --> 2413.96
indirectly

2409.44 --> 2413.96
taking a very broad grasp

2431.28 --> 2436.0
misuses the settings well that that

2434.0 --> 2438.079
would be make it even worse but i don't

2436.0 --> 2439.599
even think the ventilators are supposed

2438.079 --> 2442.2400000000002
to

2439.599 --> 2442.2400000000002
be used

2442.8 --> 2446.4
for those types of conditions

2450.079 --> 2457.28
but again yeah not a true expert on like

2455.839 --> 2461.16
medical

2457.28 --> 2461.1600000000003
emergency equipment

2471.359 --> 2476.4
i mean maybe if somebody was like truly

2474.48 --> 2478.64
unable to breathe like

2476.4 --> 2481.2000000000003
it's stuck

2478.64 --> 2482.56
then maybe

2481.2 --> 2486.0789999999997
i don't know

2482.56 --> 2488.4
can we talk about something else

2486.079 --> 2491.3590000000004
i don't feel that my input is very

2488.4 --> 2495.04
useful concerning that specific i just i

2491.359 --> 2497.2799999999997
try to avoid it all together and

2495.04 --> 2499.52
go for the eye treatment

2497.28 --> 2502.6400000000003
as soon as possible

2499.52 --> 2506.319
and make sure that doctors do not pump

2502.64 --> 2509.1189999999997
like other drugs in you

2506.319 --> 2510.319
there's some really bad drugs also being

2509.119 --> 2513.92
applied

2510.319 --> 2513.92
i can't even remember the names

2515.28 --> 2520.6400000000003
but if you like i

2517.599 --> 2522.7200000000003
is like the the thing i know if i'd hear

2520.64 --> 2524.72
it or i could name it i could name that

2522.72 --> 2527.04
the horse dewormer i could name that i

2524.72 --> 2530.56
know that's not gonna have any dangerous

2527.04 --> 2533.359
effects so i ask exclusively for that

2530.56 --> 2536.52
don't let them use any of the other crap

2533.359 --> 2536.52
on you

2557.599 --> 2560.1600000000003
intense

2560.4 --> 2564.359
first part of the show

2571.76 --> 2578.4
ah that's that's a trick question steamy

2575.04 --> 2580.079
traveler are the star sun moon

2578.4 --> 2582.4
stars sun and moon located in

2580.079 --> 2584.1600000000003
non-euclidean space

2582.4 --> 2586.48
that does

2584.16 --> 2586.48
that's

2587.2 --> 2591.4399999999996
that's

2588.48 --> 2594.88
what non-euclidean space what is this

2591.44 --> 2597.92
space that is not euclidean

2594.88 --> 2601.599
that's not really space

2597.92 --> 2602.8
so non-euclidean space doesn't exist

2601.599 --> 2607.6400000000003
but

2602.8 --> 2607.6400000000003
they don't have euclidean positions

2608.0 --> 2613.44
right they only have virtual positions

2610.8 --> 2614.92
because they're holographic

2613.44 --> 2618.7200000000003
but

2614.92 --> 2621.52
holographics don't have their own space

2618.72 --> 2623.5989999999997
it's just apparent there's only apparent

2621.52 --> 2625.839
distances that

2623.599 --> 2628.079
specifically relate

2625.839 --> 2633.88
to the observer and how they

2628.079 --> 2633.88
size up the visual only effect

2650.24 --> 2654.72
oh god yeah gaining with dude like

2652.8 --> 2658.079
dude if you have any kind of lung

2654.72 --> 2661.64
problems like get the freaking mask off

2658.079 --> 2661.6400000000003
like really

2662.72 --> 2667.4399999999996
right it seems like ah no that's do no

2666.56 --> 2669.44
you

2667.44 --> 2671.119
you're gonna eventually end up

2669.44 --> 2674.4
downplaying

2671.119 --> 2676.8
how bad wearing a mask is for your hell

2674.4 --> 2678.1600000000003
for your respiratory condition it's

2676.8 --> 2679.6800000000003
really bad

2678.16 --> 2681.839
especially if it's already kind of

2679.68 --> 2684.8799999999997
weakened

2681.839 --> 2687.2799999999997
so yeah oh you you're having a cold

2684.88 --> 2690.079
anything

2687.28 --> 2691.3590000000004
anything issues with with breathing take

2690.079 --> 2694.48
it off

2691.359 --> 2695.5989999999997
take it off tell and and and defend that

2694.48 --> 2697.68
defend

2695.599 --> 2700.1600000000003
taking it off saying like no i need to

2697.68 --> 2702.72
breathe or i'm i might die

2700.16 --> 2705.04
if i put that freaking thing on

2702.72 --> 2706.9599999999996
it's gonna get worse i need to recover

2705.04 --> 2707.92
and if people find that unacceptable

2706.96 --> 2710.8
then

2707.92 --> 2710.8
take sick leave

2711.52 --> 2717.04
don't even get freaking tested or it

2714.0 --> 2720.56
doesn't matter what it literally doesn't

2717.04 --> 2721.359
matter tests [ __ ] it's all [ __ ]

2720.56 --> 2725.04
just

2721.359 --> 2727.2799999999997
breathing issues don't put that [ __ ]

2725.04 --> 2729.92
thing on your face

2727.28 --> 2732.3190000000004
and if people then don't accept that and

2729.92 --> 2733.52
they're like afraid of you snuttering or

2732.319 --> 2735.92
whatever

2733.52 --> 2738.8
among them then just like okay then i'll

2735.92 --> 2740.88
go home and take sick leave

2738.8 --> 2741.92
just recover have good sleep a lot of

2740.88 --> 2744.56
sleep

2741.92 --> 2747.839
get some chicken soup or something

2744.56 --> 2747.839
plenty of vitamin c

2748.0 --> 2751.92
and yeah things should be all right

2755.04 --> 2761.2799999999997
how are virtual locations used to find

2758.56 --> 2763.2799999999997
actual real euclidean locations they

2761.28 --> 2765.44
aren't steamy traveler they're not at

2763.28 --> 2765.44
all

2766.16 --> 2770.72
there is no virtual location involved

2771.2 --> 2774.8799999999997
in the triangulation process in the real

2773.68 --> 2776.64
world

2774.88 --> 2778.319
the only thing that is used is the

2776.64 --> 2780.319
angular

2778.319 --> 2782.96
relations

2780.319 --> 2784.88
and for the for the angle you don't need

2782.96 --> 2787.88
a specific position you just need the

2784.88 --> 2787.88
angle

2794.56 --> 2798.4
right

2795.839 --> 2801.04
when it concerns the celestials

2798.4 --> 2803.04
the angles are absolute

2801.04 --> 2805.2799999999997
that's the one thing that are absolute

2803.04 --> 2807.839
in relation to the earth the angles

2805.28 --> 2811.44
there they are that angle

2807.839 --> 2813.44
in that position and that's what it is

2811.44 --> 2817.48
but

2813.44 --> 2817.48
nothing about it is euclidean

2818.16 --> 2822.8799999999997
you could literally just see it as a

2820.319 --> 2826.4
virtual like any star even

2822.88 --> 2829.119
is like a line it's just a line

2826.4 --> 2832.319
that exists there and if you go there if

2829.119 --> 2835.359
you follow that virtual line then that

2832.319 --> 2838.079
line simply might disappear dissipate

2835.359 --> 2838.0789999999997
into nothing

2839.2 --> 2843.0789999999997
because it's light manifest

2844.0 --> 2848.079
it's not actually coming from an object

2846.48 --> 2850.96
in a distance

2848.079 --> 2855.559
it's manifesting in that

2850.96 --> 2855.559
consistent angular fashion

2866.16 --> 2870.0789999999997
how do you link somebody to debate on

2868.48 --> 2871.92
nathan's show well

2870.079 --> 2875.04
looked online disco you couldn't find a

2871.92 --> 2875.04
discord server really

2876.96 --> 2879.28
uh

2880.96 --> 2883.52
i think

2884.079 --> 2887.28
nathan should have like the discord

2886.079 --> 2890.1600000000003
links

2887.28 --> 2890.1600000000003
on his shows

2893.359 --> 2898.68
let me

2895.28 --> 2898.6800000000003
find it

2906.96 --> 2910.96
join

2908.64 --> 2913.7599999999998
to join

2910.96 --> 2915.68
yeah the link is in there i'll give you

2913.76 --> 2917.6800000000003
the link

2915.68 --> 2920.319
i'll put it in the chat so this is the

2917.68 --> 2922.72
discord link if you want to join

2920.319 --> 2923.52
the discord on the flat earth debates

2922.72 --> 2925.1189999999997
live

2923.52 --> 2926.839
show

2925.119 --> 2930.319
hey

2926.839 --> 2930.319
that's what the

2931.52 --> 2934.0
it didn't

2941.76 --> 2947.5200000000004
didn't copy it

2944.4 --> 2950.88
super annoying

2947.52 --> 2955.319
okay let's do it again

2950.88 --> 2955.319
i mean i said copy link

2961.2 --> 2965.7999999999997
yeah that's more like it here you go

2977.76 --> 2982.3590000000004
discord links are broken for you

2984.48 --> 2990.8
well you have to like

2987.76 --> 2992.0
i just use discord as a separate

2990.8 --> 2994.48
uh

2992.0 --> 2996.72
program for my computer

2994.48 --> 2998.96
and then the links opens up a page and

2996.72 --> 2999.839
that kind of forces my computer to open

2998.96 --> 3000.8
up

2999.839 --> 3004.319
the

3000.8 --> 3004.319
separate discord program

3004.4 --> 3008.2400000000002
and then

3005.44 --> 3008.2400000000002
you get in there

3009.28 --> 3014.3190000000004
but yeah discord does have issues with

3011.599 --> 3017.839
some people it's a bit complicated i i'm

3014.319 --> 3017.839
not an expert at all

3019.68 --> 3025.48
link says it's invalid or expired that's

3022.48 --> 3025.48
odd

3027.359 --> 3031.2
i could open up discord

3033.04 --> 3037.92
if i could find it

3034.88 --> 3037.92
where the hell did it

3038.839 --> 3042.4
go what the

3048.0 --> 3051.0
what

3056.96 --> 3061.599
oh over there

3059.2 --> 3061.5989999999997
[ __ ]

3062.079 --> 3067.88
how did you get all the way over there

3064.72 --> 3067.8799999999997
all right

3081.839 --> 3086.96
hmm

3084.16 --> 3086.96
okay let's see

3092.0 --> 3095.8
how does that work

3096.64 --> 3105.4
how do you invite somebody

3100.16 --> 3105.3999999999996
i need a like an invite link

3136.88 --> 3142.559
i'm having some trouble finding it

3139.68 --> 3142.5589999999997
that's weird

3150.079 --> 3153.8390000000004
where's the fed section

3166.319 --> 3169.839
ah

3167.839 --> 3172.16
right right

3169.839 --> 3172.16
uh

3173.92 --> 3176.7200000000003
okay

3175.04 --> 3179.72
how do i

3176.72 --> 3179.72
invite

3185.359 --> 3189.0789999999997
invite people

3198.079 --> 3202.4
okay

3199.2 --> 3202.3999999999996
i think i have it

3204.079 --> 3209.2400000000002
wait that's different that's a different

3206.24 --> 3209.24
link

3213.119 --> 3216.88
okay i'll try this just try this one

3215.44 --> 3221.2400000000002
then this is

3216.88 --> 3221.2400000000002
this is the what popped up

3223.68 --> 3229.0
there's nobody in there

3225.28 --> 3229.0
by the way just yet

3242.88 --> 3245.88
anyway

3266.72 --> 3270.3999999999996
ah that works that's great

3277.2 --> 3285.64
so yeah still got 45 minutes good to go

3281.2 --> 3285.64
i feel a little bit more woken up

3303.92 --> 3307.839
so what do you guys want to talk about

3314.0 --> 3317.76
he's a ordinary

3317.839 --> 3323.119
you mean

3318.839 --> 3323.119
ordinary an ordinary fella

3324.48 --> 3328.4
okay just be careful though because it

3326.559 --> 3330.559
doesn't really matter where you come

3328.4 --> 3332.1600000000003
from if you get on nathan's and you act

3330.559 --> 3334.079
like a baller

3332.16 --> 3335.68
you get all triggered you are going to

3334.079 --> 3337.8390000000004
get the treatment

3335.68 --> 3337.839
so

3338.799 --> 3341.52
be careful

3343.44 --> 3347.04
like if you have troubles

3347.119 --> 3351.2000000000003
with admitting certain things

3349.76 --> 3353.8390000000004
for yourself

3351.2 --> 3356.96
and you have objections against

3353.839 --> 3360.24
a very angry british person

3356.96 --> 3363.839
basically humiliating you

3360.24 --> 3363.839
then you might want to stay away

3368.0 --> 3372.16
but please don't it's very amusing

3373.76 --> 3376.88
angry

3374.88 --> 3380.319
omari

3376.88 --> 3381.599
ornery means angry

3380.319 --> 3384.4
does

3381.599 --> 3384.4
never heard of that

3385.44 --> 3388.44
ordinary

3389.33 --> 3392.4
[Applause]

3390.96 --> 3395.04
bad tempered

3392.4 --> 3395.04
oh dear

3400.079 --> 3404.7200000000003
well if he's just gonna be like very

3402.48 --> 3406.88
easy to curse and all that

3404.72 --> 3410.24
then maybe the

3406.88 --> 3412.1600000000003
fed discord is not the best place

3410.24 --> 3415.2
because if he's gonna get like that he

3412.16 --> 3419.0
will just be muted

3415.2 --> 3419.0
for being terrible

3432.319 --> 3435.319
anyway

3440.3 --> 3443.489
[Music]

3466.72 --> 3472.8799999999997
so yeah i hope i answered steamy

3469.28 --> 3472.88
travelers last question

3474.0 --> 3479.28
like how are virtual locations used to

3476.24 --> 3480.9599999999996
find actually real euclidean locations i

3479.28 --> 3482.1600000000003
hope i answered that

3480.96 --> 3484.4
complete

3482.16 --> 3488.839
completely

3484.4 --> 3488.839
didn't have any follow-up questions

3501.2 --> 3504.2
um

3516.24 --> 3519.839
it's so different man

3518.319 --> 3522.079
from yesterday

3519.839 --> 3522.0789999999997
like

3528.839 --> 3534.48
yeah and it really does also stand out

3532.319 --> 3537.2
to me like how long these leaves are

3534.48 --> 3537.2
holding on

3541.119 --> 3547.119
so i i think that nature is not

3544.799 --> 3548.88
is like yeah it's still a little bit of

3547.119 --> 3550.1600000000003
summer

3548.88 --> 3552.559
sort of

3550.16 --> 3555.2799999999997
so it seems like it's holding on for a

3552.559 --> 3555.28
little longer

3557.599 --> 3561.079
i like it

3588.96 --> 3595.839
did i ever consider becoming a hearty

3592.319 --> 3595.839
cold tourist

3599.44 --> 3602.48
what

3600.64 --> 3605.7599999999998
i need to

3602.48 --> 3605.76
look that up is like

3606.72 --> 3611.2
that's plants

3608.559 --> 3611.2000000000003
i know that

3613.359 --> 3619.839
the science and art of the development

3617.2 --> 3621.5989999999997
sustainable production what

3619.839 --> 3623.7599999999998
marketing

3621.599 --> 3625.52
use high value

3623.76 --> 3629.6400000000003
intensively

3625.52 --> 3629.64
cultivated food

3640.799 --> 3643.46
ah

3643.04 --> 3644.72
what

3643.46 --> 3647.839
[Music]

3644.72 --> 3649.2
i don't know i like plants i i like

3647.839 --> 3651.599
gardens

3649.2 --> 3654.0
and i do feel i have like

3651.599 --> 3657.44
special talents with that

3654.0 --> 3659.2
even as a kid

3657.44 --> 3661.839
like me and plants

3659.2 --> 3664.24
go together very well and i even get the

3661.839 --> 3666.799
impression sometimes like

3664.24 --> 3669.799
i can adopt plants and they just live

3666.799 --> 3669.799
longer

3672.799 --> 3679.44
but is that does that make me a hearty

3675.599 --> 3682.079
culturalist culturist i don't think so

3679.44 --> 3686.64
seems very specific

3682.079 --> 3689.76
a gardener yeah sure gardener i love it

3686.64 --> 3689.7599999999998
gotta have a garden though

3691.44 --> 3698.92
now will i become an expert at it

3695.359 --> 3698.92
i doubt it

3703.68 --> 3705.9199999999996
but

3706.0 --> 3710.0
maybe over time

3707.839 --> 3712.5589999999997
i'll definitely like listening to

3710.0 --> 3713.839
experts about it

3712.559 --> 3715.8390000000004
and then maybe

3713.839 --> 3718.4
that'll rub off on me and then i'll get

3715.839 --> 3720.64
better at it

3718.4 --> 3720.64
right

3724.48 --> 3727.839
but in a way i am

3732.0 --> 3736.0
i have more of a fascination with

3736.079 --> 3738.48
people

3738.559 --> 3744.0
i like growing

3741.52 --> 3747.92
consciousness

3744.0 --> 3747.92
and i even see it as plants

3748.88 --> 3752.079
so i'm like a

3752.88 --> 3755.839
metaphysical

3756.079 --> 3762.599
i'm a metaphysical

3758.88 --> 3762.599
hearty culturist

3766.079 --> 3771.119
applying psychology morality

3769.359 --> 3774.16
and

3771.119 --> 3774.1600000000003
energy magic

3776.16 --> 3780.2799999999997
i got a title for today

3799.44 --> 3802.44
okay

3815.039 --> 3821.88
hey guns another one rmp

3817.92 --> 3821.88
how am i i'm doing great

3845.28 --> 3849.96
hello tasmanian truther by the way

3855.13 --> 3859.52
[Music]

3857.92 --> 3861.29
right

3859.52 --> 3863.119
but in a way you could

3861.29 --> 3865.0389999999998
[Music]

3863.119 --> 3866.319
you could call the metaphysical hearty

3865.039 --> 3870.2400000000002
culture is

3866.319 --> 3870.24
you could call it a dream gardener

3873.039 --> 3877.44
that might be even a better title

3879.44 --> 3883.7200000000003
it's like the colloquial version

3899.2 --> 3903.4399999999996
real sickness as i see it people having

3901.839 --> 3905.119
arguments with themselves avoiding the

3903.44 --> 3906.96
truth that points the finger in the

3905.119 --> 3910.2400000000002
mirror right

3906.96 --> 3912.7200000000003
it's like a spiritual winter

3910.24 --> 3915.52
right the plant only

3912.72 --> 3917.1189999999997
starts growing

3915.52 --> 3919.2
when the

3917.119 --> 3921.359
when the skin is feeling like yeah the

3919.2 --> 3923.68
temperature is right the amount of light

3921.359 --> 3926.319
coming through is right

3923.68 --> 3928.48
if people are constantly just like

3926.319 --> 3930.5589999999997
deflecting retreating

3928.48 --> 3934.079
then they're effectively

3930.559 --> 3935.6800000000003
staying stuck in winter freeze mode

3934.079 --> 3936.88
metaphysically

3935.68 --> 3939.0389999999998
see

3936.88 --> 3940.559
people and their consciousness are just

3939.039 --> 3943.8390000000004
like plants

3940.559 --> 3946.1600000000003
like the patterns are

3943.839 --> 3948.16
very correlatory

3946.16 --> 3951.2799999999997
and that's why i like to that's why i

3948.16 --> 3953.52
started out comparing myself to a tree

3951.28 --> 3955.119
right and i started doing that like two

3953.52 --> 3958.72
years ago or more

3955.119 --> 3960.799
like i'm a very slow growing tree but i

3958.72 --> 3964.8799999999997
just grow steadily

3960.799 --> 3967.52
and it's very strong i'm like

3964.88 --> 3969.359
i'm hardwood i'm ebony

3967.52 --> 3973.559
slow growing

3969.359 --> 3973.5589999999997
but strong and reliable

3979.28 --> 3983.079
high density wood

4004.64 --> 4009.359
if your child isn't registered in a

4007.119 --> 4010.88
school

4009.359 --> 4013.5989999999997
i don't know

4010.88 --> 4013.599
getting wisdom

4016.799 --> 4021.839
i've personally never been forced to

4018.559 --> 4021.8390000000004
face that situation

4021.92 --> 4027.28
so i i don't fully understand but

4024.559 --> 4029.6800000000003
technically you should just be able to

4027.28 --> 4032.559
apply homeschooling

4029.68 --> 4034.64
right i could think on the surface not

4032.559 --> 4037.039
fully having a grasp of how these things

4034.64 --> 4038.799
go just yet but i could grasp on the

4037.039 --> 4041.8390000000004
surface that okay if you have to be

4038.799 --> 4043.839
registered well just register them

4041.839 --> 4047.48
go to the school head and just say okay

4043.839 --> 4047.48
i'm gonna do homeschooling

4048.4 --> 4053.359
and i want you to basically

4051.599 --> 4055.44
cooperate

4053.359 --> 4056.88
in having him registered here but he

4055.44 --> 4058.799
will be home schooled here and then

4056.88 --> 4060.48
maybe the exams on the school or

4058.799 --> 4063.52
whatever

4060.48 --> 4064.72
something like that right

4063.52 --> 4067.359
just

4064.72 --> 4067.359
don't feel

4068.319 --> 4072.64
you can't step straight to the

4070.0 --> 4072.64
management

4074.48 --> 4079.44
because you could

4076.96 --> 4081.52
in the end even the schools they serve

4079.44 --> 4083.92
the people that's what they're there for

4081.52 --> 4086.079
to educate

4083.92 --> 4087.839
to take over the role

4086.079 --> 4089.44
of educating it

4087.839 --> 4091.52
through homeschooling which was the

4089.44 --> 4094.2400000000002
original yeah

4091.52 --> 4097.359
homeschooling is the original that's

4094.24 --> 4100.159
what everybody always has done

4097.359 --> 4102.839
for thousands of years right this this

4100.159 --> 4107.199
centralized state

4102.839 --> 4109.759
run school is pretty recent

4107.199 --> 4112.639999999999
compared to homeschooling which is the

4109.759 --> 4115.679
original application

4112.64 --> 4118.4800000000005
you see and if you see it like that

4115.679 --> 4120.719
then you can also just change your

4118.48 --> 4123.44
approach and realize like yeah they are

4120.719 --> 4125.52
actually there to assist us

4123.44 --> 4127.44
if we don't want to homeschool

4125.52 --> 4129.4400000000005
that's really what it is not the other

4127.44 --> 4131.919999999999
way around

4129.44 --> 4135.04
homeschooling is not a new thing it was

4131.92 --> 4135.04
the original thing

4140.4 --> 4145.839
except

4141.759 --> 4148.719
a standardized yeah instead of a

4145.839 --> 4151.04
teaching curriculum it would just be

4148.719 --> 4154.96
teach your kids how to

4151.04 --> 4159.359
how to work how to build stuff

4154.96 --> 4159.359
how to dig how to even design

4159.44 --> 4164.4
how to take care of animals

4161.759 --> 4166.159
right that that's basically the original

4164.4 --> 4168.48
homeschooling

4166.159 --> 4170.3189999999995
but now there's curriculum

4168.48 --> 4173.759
there's information that's kind of

4170.319 --> 4175.6
required to be taught well then master

4173.759 --> 4178.239
it and teach that

4175.6 --> 4180.719
to your kids be careful

4178.239 --> 4183.678999999999
give them all the insights they need in

4180.719 --> 4186.08
order also to identify themselves like

4183.679 --> 4187.759
this is wrong this is right

4186.08 --> 4192.3189999999995
this is where they're trying to make me

4187.759 --> 4192.319
stupid and this is the real information

4200.159 --> 4204.32
don't use

4201.6 --> 4208.4400000000005
or cell phone on the internet what are

4204.32 --> 4208.44
you talking about george sanford

4221.679 --> 4225.36
what do you think about bamboo as a

4223.52 --> 4228.360000000001
construction material i've heard about

4225.36 --> 4228.36
it

4234.4 --> 4238.0
yeah

4236.48 --> 4239.44
yeah bamboo is

4238.0 --> 4241.76
bamboo

4239.44 --> 4243.678999999999
very good construction material and i

4241.76 --> 4246.8
think that the

4243.679 --> 4248.4
pandas would also appreciate it

4246.8 --> 4251.92
because that would mean there's food

4248.4 --> 4251.92
everywhere if things break down

4252.719 --> 4256.2390000000005
just kidding

4254.159 --> 4257.5199999999995
that's actually true because hey if

4256.239 --> 4259.28
you're going to grow bamboo that means

4257.52 --> 4260.320000000001
there's going to be bamboo

4259.28 --> 4262.0
right

4260.32 --> 4264.32
so

4262.0 --> 4265.76
yeah bamboo as a construction material

4264.32 --> 4267.199
i've heard of it

4265.76 --> 4271.64
like even

4267.199 --> 4271.639999999999
15 years back i've heard of it

4318.159 --> 4321.159
hmm

4363.12 --> 4365.44
what

4369.12 --> 4375.44
huh this is like a new ok your accounts

4371.92 --> 4375.4400000000005
get deleted what are you doing

4375.679 --> 4380.4
like seriously what are you doing out

4377.6 --> 4382.96
there george sanford to to get like

4380.4 --> 4382.96
deleted

4383.36 --> 4387.199
i don't understand at all

4395.52 --> 4400.159000000001
that's not happening to me at all like

4398.48 --> 4402.32
at all

4400.159 --> 4404.4
so i don't get it

4402.32 --> 4407.36
share videos

4404.4 --> 4409.28
well don't i share videos here all the

4407.36 --> 4412.599999999999
time

4409.28 --> 4412.599999999999
don't i

4420.56 --> 4426.6
if they don't like the vid oh

4422.64 --> 4426.6
oh really well

4426.64 --> 4432.2390000000005
i don't see it bro i really don't i

4429.12 --> 4435.679
don't know what you're doing out there

4432.239 --> 4435.678999999999
but i go places

4438.719 --> 4442.88
i watch a lot of different videos and

4440.56 --> 4444.96
different platforms but also

4442.88 --> 4446.0
youtube

4444.96 --> 4447.679
and

4446.0 --> 4449.28
that includes like

4447.679 --> 4452.4800000000005
like

4449.28 --> 4455.28
lockdown protests and all that so

4452.48 --> 4456.959999999999
i don't see it at all

4455.28 --> 4459.5199999999995
i don't know what's going on with you

4456.96 --> 4462.159
what you've been up to recently

4459.52 --> 4465.040000000001
but i don't do not have those issues not

4462.159 --> 4465.04
even remotely

4465.679 --> 4472.56
a controversial video

4469.84 --> 4472.56
oh really

4474.88 --> 4479.12
oh you mean

4477.04 --> 4484.08
panic riddled

4479.12 --> 4484.08
fear porn inducing videos

4485.6 --> 4491.6
the ones that don't actually help inform

4488.239 --> 4495.678999999999
you but just make you panic and

4491.6 --> 4495.679
revolt those types of videos

4514.88 --> 4518.64
quantum computer will destroy

4516.719 --> 4520.159
cryptocurrency since

4518.64 --> 4523.4400000000005
no

4520.159 --> 4527.12
no that no steamy traveler

4523.44 --> 4530.239
now what they'll just do is create other

4527.12 --> 4532.4
quantum computers basic it's just fast

4530.239 --> 4535.36
computers right quantum

4532.4 --> 4535.36
that's not anything

4535.44 --> 4541.5199999999995
the idea of quantum computer is nonsense

4538.08 --> 4543.84
it's just a really fast computer

4541.52 --> 4546.96
but yeah oh it will break the

4543.84 --> 4549.84
cryptography oh yeah well until

4546.96 --> 4552.4
quantum computers are used to build

4549.84 --> 4555.400000000001
better cryptography so

4552.4 --> 4555.4
no

4568.239 --> 4571.759999999999
i rarely share links

4572.64 --> 4576.56
i'm sorry

4573.92 --> 4578.719
i put a link i put like

4576.56 --> 4580.96
one two three

4578.719 --> 4584.96
links in my chat

4580.96 --> 4584.96
every day what are you talking about

4591.92 --> 4595.8
i link all the time

4596.96 --> 4602.0
but yeah a lot of the times it's not

4599.36 --> 4605.839999999999
about that it's not about oh link this

4602.0 --> 4607.36
link that this is the this is the clicky

4605.84 --> 4610.4800000000005
hour

4607.36 --> 4613.679
this is oh look at this no this is not a

4610.48 --> 4616.959999999999
link gathering database show okay this

4613.679 --> 4619.1990000000005
is where things are discussed

4616.96 --> 4621.04
in a way you're assumed to already know

4619.199 --> 4623.36
about these things

4621.04 --> 4626.56
and if you don't then you're assumed to

4623.36 --> 4629.04
inform yourself very quickly about these

4626.56 --> 4630.64
things and that's what i do too

4629.04 --> 4632.239
but this is not a

4630.64 --> 4633.84
convenient

4632.239 --> 4636.879999999999
link bucket

4633.84 --> 4639.360000000001
show okay that's not what the early bird

4636.88 --> 4639.36
show is

4641.92 --> 4647.6
but i will absolutely have links

4644.08 --> 4650.5599999999995
especially to people i want to promote

4647.6 --> 4653.679
the other day i put out the link for

4650.56 --> 4656.400000000001
remember that hilarious sketch from the

4653.679 --> 4658.719
redheaded guy

4656.4 --> 4659.679
about the

4658.719 --> 4660.56
life

4659.679 --> 4662.8
fest

4660.56 --> 4665.84
remember

4662.8 --> 4665.84
i put that link out

4666.0 --> 4668.8
that was new

4672.32 --> 4676.639999999999
like flat side even mirrored a part of

4674.48 --> 4678.4
that which is kind of a risky procedure

4676.64 --> 4681.12
if you ask me because

4678.4 --> 4683.28
that was definitely his creative project

4681.12 --> 4685.5199999999995
so you might risk a copyright strike for

4683.28 --> 4685.5199999999995
that

4685.679 --> 4688.56
but

4686.88 --> 4691.679
yeah

4688.56 --> 4694.400000000001
i do absolutely bring links to the

4691.679 --> 4695.679
attention quickly if i think it is a

4694.4 --> 4697.839999999999
good thing

4695.679 --> 4699.52
if it's like oh oh look who got [ __ ] in

4697.84 --> 4701.679
your face right now

4699.52 --> 4704.64
oh it's going to create this then i'm

4701.679 --> 4707.28
like yeah get the [ __ ] out of here

4704.64 --> 4710.159000000001
i don't care of like oh look at this

4707.28 --> 4711.599999999999
horror thing oh now it's time to squirt

4710.159 --> 4713.92
yeah no

4711.6 --> 4717.360000000001
that [ __ ] i don't care about because

4713.92 --> 4720.56
what's it gonna do it's just gonna

4717.36 --> 4724.36
make you lose focus

4720.56 --> 4724.360000000001
and i don't want that

4740.239 --> 4744.639999999999
yeah some people do have trouble doing a

4742.64 --> 4747.04
good google search but google searching

4744.64 --> 4750.4800000000005
is kind of its own art

4747.04 --> 4753.92
it used to be super super reliable like

4750.48 --> 4755.28
google searching used to be the best

4753.92 --> 4758.4
searching

4755.28 --> 4760.32
system that could literally guess your

4758.4 --> 4763.839999999999
mind

4760.32 --> 4763.84
it was telepathic through

4765.6 --> 4767.76
that

4768.4 --> 4774.0
it it was kind of telepathic through

4771.199 --> 4774.799999999999
just the understanding

4774.0 --> 4776.8
right

4774.8 --> 4779.28
it was so good the algorithm and then

4776.8 --> 4782.08
they started to [ __ ] around with it and

4779.28 --> 4783.599999999999
now it's unpredictable

4782.08 --> 4785.5199999999995
some google

4783.6 --> 4787.280000000001
results are different with different

4785.52 --> 4790.400000000001
people now

4787.28 --> 4793.5199999999995
so i can't just say oh just do this i'd

4790.4 --> 4795.759999999999
never say like just google this unless i

4793.52 --> 4797.679
already know that pretty much no matter

4795.76 --> 4798.719
who you are it's gonna yield the same

4797.679 --> 4800.4800000000005
result

4798.719 --> 4802.64
because it is not like politically

4800.48 --> 4805.5199999999995
contested or it is so politically

4802.64 --> 4807.92
contested only one type of result will

4805.52 --> 4809.76
roll out right if i just say oh just

4807.92 --> 4811.84
google this just google that about

4809.76 --> 4812.719
subjects that i don't know much about

4811.84 --> 4814.8
yet

4812.719 --> 4817.36
i don't know what kind of results you're

4814.8 --> 4819.1990000000005
gonna have so why would i then just

4817.36 --> 4821.5199999999995
suggest that

4819.199 --> 4823.12
if i want you to to figure out something

4821.52 --> 4825.280000000001
specific

4823.12 --> 4827.36
right it the google rhythm

4825.28 --> 4828.48
search rhythm is not as reliable as it

4827.36 --> 4831.199
used to be

4828.48 --> 4834.239
it's still very powerful but it's just

4831.199 --> 4836.0
it's out of whack it does weird things

4834.239 --> 4838.718999999999
manipulative things

4836.0 --> 4840.96
with the individuals

4838.719 --> 4840.96
so

4842.0 --> 4846.88
but if the subject is very specific and

4844.48 --> 4850.0
narrow then it does become more reliable

4846.88 --> 4855.0
because there's less opportunity for

4850.0 --> 4855.0
the algorithm to screw around with you

4868.0 --> 4872.159
yes the swiss canal

4870.159 --> 4874.638999999999
great fear yeah yeah

4872.159 --> 4877.12
isn't it and it's an older video too or

4874.639 --> 4879.1990000000005
it might simply be very similar video

4877.12 --> 4880.159
because hey these ships they go the same

4879.199 --> 4882.48
routes

4880.159 --> 4886.239
just stick a camera on top of it and it

4882.48 --> 4886.239
will look pretty much the same

4887.12 --> 4891.599999999999
but yeah when it it plays by really

4889.44 --> 4893.759999999999
quickly then you get to see just how

4891.6 --> 4896.400000000001
incredibly flat

4893.76 --> 4900.679
the earth really is

4896.4 --> 4900.679
glad you enjoyed that mike sudenich

4902.8 --> 4907.6
duckduckgo is what google used is it

4905.12 --> 4909.199
though is it is it exactly the same

4907.6 --> 4913.4800000000005
algorithm

4909.199 --> 4913.48
ben white are you sure

4925.04 --> 4930.199
all right anyway

4926.48 --> 4930.199
be back in two minutes

4933.36 --> 4936.36
hmm

4937.15 --> 4940.9
[Music]

5005.199 --> 5008.199
um

5014.08 --> 5020.679
behaves similar

5017.679 --> 5020.679
hmm

5036.239 --> 5040.48
what do i think about la palma volcano

5040.96 --> 5045.92
well it's a volcano

5043.04 --> 5048.48
and there's lava coming out now

5045.92 --> 5048.4800000000005
lots of it

5050.4 --> 5056.5199999999995
what else is there to think about it

5052.96 --> 5056.52
of what

5081.28 --> 5084.28
do

5089.44 --> 5092.638999999999
that's not helpful

5095.36 --> 5099.839999999999
i'm trying to

5096.88 --> 5099.84
just

5100.159 --> 5103.28
find where it is

5107.28 --> 5111.8
oh right it's off the coast of morocco

5113.36 --> 5115.599999999999
hmm

5121.84 --> 5128.159000000001
right so it's just more volcanic ground

5124.4 --> 5128.159
kind of forming there i guess

5132.96 --> 5138.08
that's gonna be a blessing dude like

5134.8 --> 5140.8
seriously volcanoes and all that

5138.08 --> 5143.12
especially like ocean-bound ones they're

5140.8 --> 5145.76
like really good

5143.12 --> 5149.5199999999995
for oceanic life like as soon as that

5145.76 --> 5150.88
volcano kind of stops rests a bit

5149.52 --> 5153.040000000001
like

5150.88 --> 5155.6
just imagine all the freaking minerals

5153.04 --> 5158.08
that are being deposited with all that

5155.6 --> 5158.08
lava

5158.32 --> 5163.759999999999
like everything's gonna flourish

5161.04 --> 5167.12
volcanoes are great

5163.76 --> 5170.159000000001
it just kind of sucks when yeah the lava

5167.12 --> 5172.4
decides to go right over your village

5170.159 --> 5174.96
yeah that sucks

5172.4 --> 5174.96
i get it

5181.52 --> 5184.8
the [ __ ] bad karma

5190.8 --> 5197.719
that's [ __ ] stop straw manning us

5193.92 --> 5197.719
bad karma it's annoying

5205.84 --> 5212.159000000001
earthquake storm started oh no

5208.719 --> 5215.12
oh no they're destroying the earth

5212.159 --> 5217.759999999999
it's always all people with their secret

5215.12 --> 5221.12
technology you know the special boy

5217.76 --> 5224.159000000001
wizardry oh we're so powerful we create

5221.12 --> 5227.28
the earthquakes we change the weather we

5224.159 --> 5229.12
change everything we are literally just

5227.28 --> 5232.0
interfering with the matrix because

5229.12 --> 5234.48
we're all powerful oh yeah

5232.0 --> 5234.48
sure

5235.199 --> 5239.36
or

5236.56 --> 5241.76
it's just nature

5239.36 --> 5244.5599999999995
and there's a lot of really arrogant

5241.76 --> 5246.639
special boy types out there

5244.56 --> 5247.76
that just like

5246.639 --> 5251.4400000000005
the dumb

5247.76 --> 5253.84
flock people to believe they're all

5251.44 --> 5256.96
powerful

5253.84 --> 5259.6
so they spread these ideas around

5256.96 --> 5260.88
so that people will start to chant about

5259.6 --> 5264.4800000000005
they

5260.88 --> 5267.36
and how they are doing all this and then

5264.48 --> 5269.599999999999
eventually they'll start losing track

5267.36 --> 5271.5199999999995
while these special boy wizards that

5269.6 --> 5274.159000000001
started all that

5271.52 --> 5275.280000000001
looking out like yeah

5274.159 --> 5276.638999999999
they

5275.28 --> 5280.84
is me

5276.639 --> 5280.84
they just don't know it's

5281.44 --> 5286.0
and it's all an illusion because

5283.6 --> 5288.96
nothing's really changed it's just

5286.0 --> 5290.8
there's now the ideas that men are all

5288.96 --> 5294.6
powerful somehow and that they're

5290.8 --> 5294.6
keeping it all a secret

5296.159 --> 5301.28
yeah it's a very tenacious rumor it's a

5298.719 --> 5302.88
little g rumor by the way

5301.28 --> 5305.5199999999995
ever thought about that

5302.88 --> 5306.639
it's a little g rumor

5305.52 --> 5309.6
a man

5306.639 --> 5312.56
all powerful can change the fate of the

5309.6 --> 5315.04
realm sounds like a little g

5312.56 --> 5315.04
to me

5316.32 --> 5319.44
are you sure you want to conjure that in

5318.08 --> 5323.159
your mind

5319.44 --> 5323.159
you need that icon

5327.27 --> 5333.0
[Music]

5329.679 --> 5333.0
it's idolatry

5334.55 --> 5340.0
[Music]

5337.04 --> 5340.0
is that the right word

5348.84 --> 5354.8
yes i got it right thank god

5351.92 --> 5356.96
i hate it when i get words wrong when i

5354.8 --> 5360.719
talk on that level

5356.96 --> 5365.159
but usually it turns out i was right

5360.719 --> 5365.159
but i had to check it to make sure

5375.6 --> 5379.84
how else you gonna explain the lava

5382.239 --> 5386.04
dude what's your problem

5392.639 --> 5397.04
and how exactly is lava produced deep

5395.04 --> 5400.08
deep underground

5397.04 --> 5402.56
well it probably has to do with heat and

5400.08 --> 5402.5599999999995
pressure

5404.4 --> 5408.5599999999995
right and that would kind of go inside

5406.32 --> 5410.639
right you heat up

5408.56 --> 5412.080000000001
let's just say there's a giant

5410.639 --> 5415.52
artificial

5412.08 --> 5418.5599999999995
or natural induction coil

5415.52 --> 5418.56
deep underground

5419.44 --> 5423.919999999999
and it literally just

5422.159 --> 5426.879999999999
starts melting

5423.92 --> 5429.92
the ground there constantly

5426.88 --> 5434.08
and it's a lot of a lot of rock that's

5429.92 --> 5436.4
basically being inductioned

5434.08 --> 5438.5599999999995
it gets molten

5436.4 --> 5441.36
it gets pressurized

5438.56 --> 5444.320000000001
because it's hot and when things heat up

5441.36 --> 5445.5199999999995
they pressure they expand right so it's

5444.32 --> 5446.96
gonna

5445.52 --> 5449.4400000000005
want to

5446.96 --> 5452.4800000000005
squish through the

5449.44 --> 5455.04
the less tight parts and get out

5452.48 --> 5458.879999999999
and that's how a volcano then

5455.04 --> 5460.88
eventually squirts out the lava

5458.88 --> 5463.04
right that's my conception of what

5460.88 --> 5465.679
volcanoes might be i did i've done a

5463.04 --> 5469.28
hangout specifically daddy one of my

5465.679 --> 5471.679
most watched hangouts ever

5469.28 --> 5474.639
in for my flat earth talks days still

5471.679 --> 5476.88
people are still squirting over that

5474.639 --> 5479.28
because yeah volcanoes are

5476.88 --> 5481.52
really weird

5479.28 --> 5483.679
they are

5481.52 --> 5486.88
like there's something odd going on with

5483.679 --> 5489.679
volcanoes they are real though

5486.88 --> 5492.88
and they are intrical they are designed

5489.679 --> 5495.84
by god they have a function they do good

5492.88 --> 5498.08
things right volcanic ashes are fertile

5495.84 --> 5500.08
there is a use for it

5498.08 --> 5503.199
it exists for good reason

5500.08 --> 5505.04
it's part of the design it's natural but

5503.199 --> 5506.719
how does it happen

5505.04 --> 5509.679
yeah

5506.719 --> 5512.159
it's a bit of a mystery

5509.679 --> 5514.4800000000005
and i thought about it like how how

5512.159 --> 5516.879999999999
could it be how could that work the way

5514.48 --> 5516.879999999999
it does

5517.52 --> 5522.400000000001
and one of the ideas was naturally

5519.52 --> 5524.639
created induction

5522.4 --> 5526.879999999999
like the same energies that

5524.639 --> 5528.400000000001
get the electric ether going or the

5526.88 --> 5530.400000000001
magnetics

5528.4 --> 5532.799999999999
there might be spots

5530.4 --> 5536.0
where just naturally induction kind of

5532.8 --> 5538.400000000001
builds up like the electrics get trapped

5536.0 --> 5541.12
in a certain cycle and that just causes

5538.4 --> 5544.159
that area to heat up always

5541.12 --> 5546.4
and thus there is lava pressure there

5544.159 --> 5549.04
and at the same time

5546.4 --> 5551.12
yeah there is shifting going on right

5549.04 --> 5553.92
there's always kind of shifting going

5551.12 --> 5555.679
things compact it pressures so if

5553.92 --> 5557.92
something down there

5555.679 --> 5558.84
is heating up and then squirting out a

5557.92 --> 5561.4400000000005
hot

5558.84 --> 5562.88
stuff above ground

5561.44 --> 5565.5199999999995
that means

5562.88 --> 5568.2390000000005
that then the pressure

5565.52 --> 5570.8
is decreasing also which means

5568.239 --> 5573.678999999999
everything else that is pressing down

5570.8 --> 5574.400000000001
might also shift slightly right so it

5573.679 --> 5576.88
just

5574.4 --> 5579.44
that kind of makes it fill back up makes

5576.88 --> 5581.28
the induction space

5579.44 --> 5582.638999999999
fill up again

5581.28 --> 5584.159
with new

5582.639 --> 5585.04
non-molten

5584.159 --> 5587.04
rock

5585.04 --> 5588.88
gets pushed in the area and then it

5587.04 --> 5592.88
starts to melt again right so that could

5588.88 --> 5595.88
be a continual cycling thing

5592.88 --> 5595.88
right

5606.48 --> 5611.36
can't go beyond 12 kilometers

5609.679 --> 5614.32
well not

5611.36 --> 5616.799999999999
so far at least

5614.32 --> 5619.12
a hydrogen mud situation yeah it was

5616.8 --> 5619.12
weird

5619.76 --> 5624.4400000000005
yeah lava squirt yeah it's what it is

5633.12 --> 5636.32
i got a painting

5634.719 --> 5640.4800000000005
i made

5636.32 --> 5640.48
because i do like lava i like it a lot

5640.96 --> 5644.76
i think it's very beautiful

5645.199 --> 5649.199
unless it's going straight through my

5647.44 --> 5651.678999999999
village then i don't think it's as

5649.199 --> 5651.678999999999
beautiful

5651.76 --> 5657.84
luckily there's no volcanoes over here

5655.679 --> 5662.639
uh

5657.84 --> 5662.639
there it is no there it isn't what uh

5664.0 --> 5666.639
where is it

5669.44 --> 5673.32
ah there you go

5684.08 --> 5687.84
yeah i'm gonna share that

5689.119 --> 5694.239
i like this painting

5692.32 --> 5697.239
it's one of the paintings i really like

5694.239 --> 5697.239
making

5709.6 --> 5713.639
let's make that a little bigger

5722.48 --> 5727.159
all right

5723.52 --> 5727.159000000001
so there you go

5730.08 --> 5734.4
that looks by the way

5731.84 --> 5737.119000000001
during the background how it is now

5734.4 --> 5740.638999999999
it almost like oh my god a volcano just

5737.119 --> 5743.839999999999
erupted in the background here

5740.639 --> 5743.84
isn't that just funny

5744.56 --> 5749.119000000001
oh but now it's getting lighter so it

5746.159 --> 5749.119
doesn't fit anymore

5751.28 --> 5758.4
yeah i made this

5753.84 --> 5760.719
a long time ago 20 years i think yeah

5758.4 --> 5763.719
yeah it was pretty much exactly 20 years

5760.719 --> 5763.719
ago

5780.88 --> 5785.719
you know what i'll just show the other

5782.48 --> 5785.718999999999
one too

5791.92 --> 5796.36
that one is good

5793.36 --> 5796.36
also

5798.0 --> 5801.36
i actually have this

5808.32 --> 5814.239
like on my uh

5812.159 --> 5816.0
on my money pass

5814.239 --> 5820.44
because you have can have used custom

5816.0 --> 5820.44
prints for it and i use this

5849.84 --> 5855.28
right so yeah

5851.84 --> 5857.4400000000005
i have done a few paintings most i'm not

5855.28 --> 5860.5599999999995
impressed to buy but these two i really

5857.44 --> 5863.04
liked especially the the door one is

5860.56 --> 5863.04
special

5864.159 --> 5868.4
i like it

5865.679 --> 5871.04
anyway

5868.4 --> 5873.199
oh wow

5871.04 --> 5877.28
i'm gonna round out the show

5873.199 --> 5877.28
how how time is flown all of a sudden

5881.04 --> 5884.88
ah yeah thank you steamy traveler

5886.0 --> 5888.96
it's not the first time i've shared it

5887.44 --> 5891.5199999999995
but it's the first time i shared it with

5888.96 --> 5893.6
you guys i hope you appreciate that

5891.52 --> 5896.320000000001
uh

5893.6 --> 5898.719
right so thanks everyone for coming i
