202.879 --> 207.159
i got kitty for a visitor

212.159 --> 218.319
sleeping in that basket

215.04 --> 220.959
and he's been with me all night

218.319 --> 223.04
it was kind of nice having him around

220.959 --> 226.04
didn't like disturb me in my sleep or

223.04 --> 226.04
anything

235.439 --> 240.799
right so yeah now i'm

238.4 --> 241.76000000000002
42.

240.799 --> 243.84
which is

241.76 --> 246.07999999999998
it's kind of a weird

243.84 --> 248.48
weird set of dates

246.08 --> 251.28
though being 42

248.48 --> 254.28
on the sixth

251.28 --> 254.28
of

254.56 --> 260.359
yeah of january

257.359 --> 260.359
2022

270.24 --> 273.68
right

271.6 --> 275.759
42

273.68 --> 278.40000000000003
on the sixth of two

275.759 --> 278.40000000000003
two two

278.639 --> 281.639
anyway

283.919 --> 287.59999999999997
hey matthew hall good to see you

294.32 --> 298.96
yeah i i what i had been planning to

297.199 --> 300.24
title

298.96 --> 302.23999999999995
my show

300.24 --> 304.40000000000003
something but then yeah i was kind of

302.24 --> 306.639
like

304.4 --> 308.479
gamma poking and i thought like that's

306.639 --> 311.52
not really a worthy title for my

308.479 --> 313.44
birthday show so just

311.52 --> 316.24
remove that

313.44 --> 318.71999999999997
but i was thinking about

316.24 --> 321.28000000000003
well people

318.72 --> 323.12
that we deal with what are they right i

321.28 --> 324.55999999999995
often say like oh they're just demon

323.12 --> 327.44
possessed

324.56 --> 329.84
well they're imps

327.44 --> 333.199
right they're all imps

329.84 --> 333.19899999999996
imps are like little

333.28 --> 337.35999999999996
demon

335.44 --> 339.44
yeah little demon slaves but they're

337.36 --> 341.84000000000003
always like servants

339.44 --> 341.84
really

342.72 --> 346.47900000000004
so i was thinking

345.12 --> 347.6
gimps

346.479 --> 350.32
simps

347.6 --> 350.32000000000005
and blimps

350.479 --> 355.36
and they're all imps

352.88 --> 355.36
i don't know

356.319 --> 360.96000000000004
just some of these weird little

358.72 --> 362.96000000000004
language

360.96 --> 365.039
tricks that just pop in my mind when i

362.96 --> 366.79999999999995
watch other people's streams it happens

365.039 --> 369.28
a lot

366.8 --> 372.0
i get very inspired and creative with

369.28 --> 374.23999999999995
language in other people's chats because

372.0 --> 377.6
i can it's it's very different as when

374.24 --> 377.6
i'm doing my own show because

377.84 --> 383.44
trying to uphold certain standard sounds

381.28 --> 385.52
weird like that includes rage win and

383.44 --> 388.0
all that but i i am started

385.52 --> 390.15999999999997
i uphold a certain standard

388.0 --> 392.4
but when i watch other people's streams

390.16 --> 394.56
then i don't necessarily have to do that

392.4 --> 397.84
and i can kind of overshoot

394.56 --> 399.919
in the name of creativity

397.84 --> 402.4
but it doesn't work when i am running

399.919 --> 402.4
the show

402.88 --> 406.88
so i come up with a lot of weird little

405.44 --> 407.68
word games

406.88 --> 409.759
or

407.68 --> 411.759
good descriptions in other people's

409.759 --> 414.16
chats

411.759 --> 417.36
like for example over jim bobs who is

414.16 --> 421.199
always very inspiring to me

417.36 --> 424.24
uh but also fox day on d live

421.199 --> 428.08000000000004
when he he pipes up and does a little

424.24 --> 428.08
stream about what he's doing

428.319 --> 433.12
in the bear community and all that

431.28 --> 434.84
or lift the veil

433.12 --> 437.84000000000003
nathan

434.84 --> 440.79999999999995
stopman he managed to inspire me in

437.84 --> 440.79999999999995
different ways too

441.039 --> 446.8
yeah and i just have that i just start

443.68 --> 449.52
to get creative with words

446.8 --> 453.36
anyway hey seeking star wars

449.52 --> 455.28
chocolate cupcakes for everybody

453.36 --> 459.28000000000003
thanks

455.28 --> 461.599
i actually had an illuminati croissant

459.28 --> 464.63899999999995
for a good old time's sake

461.599 --> 466.87899999999996
right before the show

464.639 --> 468.72
so i did kind of give myself a little

466.879 --> 471.12
birthday

468.72 --> 471.12
snack

475.68 --> 480.319
all right anyway i got mint tea here

481.52 --> 487.35999999999996
hello raichi

484.08 --> 488.96
quintuple zero

487.36 --> 490.8
thanks for saying hello and happy

488.96 --> 493.919
birthday

490.8 --> 496.56
hello truther luther

493.919 --> 496.56
great show

498.56 --> 501.36
why thank you

501.52 --> 507.31899999999996
my show is a little different from most

503.52 --> 507.31899999999996
people's shows though

507.84 --> 514.56
i do indulge into long pauses

512.32 --> 516.32
or

514.56 --> 517.1999999999999
yeah

516.32 --> 520.0
like

517.2 --> 523.0390000000001
pretty intense mood swings which most

520.0 --> 525.2
people don't really allow that on their

523.039 --> 528.399
live streams

525.2 --> 531.0400000000001
like unless it's a typical squabbling

528.399 --> 531.76
interaction show with other people and

531.04 --> 535.8
then

531.76 --> 535.8
more things tend to happen

538.48 --> 541.6800000000001
hello the other andrew

541.76 --> 546.3199999999999
put something in the paypal oh

544.08 --> 548.8000000000001
okay

546.32 --> 552.24
thank you truther luther i appreciate

548.8 --> 552.24
that i'll check in right now

560.72 --> 567.08
all right i haven't gotten it yet i'll

563.839 --> 567.08
keep checking

577.6 --> 582.0
42 answer to life

580.0 --> 587.0
the universe and everything

582.0 --> 587.0
what was it 42 or was it 72

590.56 --> 598.3599999999999
i keep switching them up in my mind

594.32 --> 598.36
i'm not sure was it 42

608.56 --> 615.56
okay truther luther now suddenly deletes

611.68 --> 615.56
his messages so

618.48 --> 623.04
so i guess you're not gonna send me a

620.32 --> 623.0400000000001
paypal then

623.68 --> 627.92
all right

626.0 --> 632.279
fine

627.92 --> 632.279
hey adam price good to see you

641.839 --> 646.36
you only turn 42 once

659.68 --> 664.56
it's 42 okay okay cool

662.959 --> 666.64
right i thought it was kind of weird

664.56 --> 669.279
then

666.64 --> 669.279
42

672.32 --> 679.36
on the sixth

674.88 --> 682.72
of 2022 basically although it is

679.36 --> 682.72
february so it is kind of

683.76 --> 686.88
four

684.959 --> 690.64
times two not

686.88 --> 690.64
two two but anyway

691.279 --> 694.399
it's a lot of twos

697.2 --> 701.6400000000001
zero you got four twenty yeah

702.399 --> 707.279
anyway come on it's

705.2 --> 709.9200000000001
it's not really all that

707.279 --> 712.72
significant

709.92 --> 712.7199999999999
to me anyway

715.6 --> 719.76
but it's good that i survived another

717.44 --> 719.7600000000001
year

722.16 --> 726.88
did you know that like

724.24 --> 729.76
five years ago

726.88 --> 731.76
i was like still kind of haunted by

729.76 --> 733.76
visions back then

731.76 --> 735.76
like much more paranoia in that much

733.76 --> 737.36
more things that i was scared about

735.76 --> 740.0
within it

737.36 --> 742.16
and i was actually

740.0 --> 745.519
seriously for a long time convinced that

742.16 --> 747.4399999999999
i wasn't going to live

745.519 --> 749.92
past

747.44 --> 749.9200000000001
what is it

751.279 --> 756.519
well i think like past last year

758.079 --> 762.6389999999999
even the year before it's weird i i just

760.959 --> 764.6389999999999
it's a kind of a bit of a puzzle of how

762.639 --> 767.2
that

764.639 --> 769.36
all played out interdimensionally in my

767.2 --> 771.839
head and then stuck into my memory

769.36 --> 774.9590000000001
afterward when i came back to the normal

771.839 --> 774.9590000000001
time linearity

775.519 --> 781.6
so i keep on wondering was i actually

778.56 --> 781.5999999999999
scared for like

782.8 --> 788.399
for the vaxxes for the jabs was that the

785.92 --> 790.3199999999999
thing that i was actually scared for

788.399 --> 793.2
except that i couldn't

790.32 --> 795.9200000000001
literally memorize it as such

793.2 --> 797.0400000000001
i could only kind of like feel when it's

795.92 --> 798.079
coming

797.04 --> 800.48
and i

798.079 --> 801.76
overestimated it

800.48 --> 804.72
i think that

801.76 --> 806.639
when i was much younger i was absolutely

804.72 --> 809.6800000000001
convinced that i could not prevent

806.639 --> 811.6
myself from being fooled into taking it

809.68 --> 814.6389999999999
really

811.6 --> 818.88
i i downplayed myself enormously because

814.639 --> 822.48
i did not think i had a lot of

818.88 --> 825.04
like ability to resist

822.48 --> 828.48
like things like peer pressure or the

825.04 --> 830.88
need to be inside of a group

828.48 --> 832.32
because it was a huge

830.88 --> 834.56
trouble for me

832.32 --> 836.639
like first half of my life group

834.56 --> 838.6389999999999
dynamics and the need to be a part of

836.639 --> 841.04
that

838.639 --> 843.92
so that i guess during that vision which

841.04 --> 846.48
was like when i was 17 i was kind of

843.92 --> 847.92
convinced upon stumbling upon what was

846.48 --> 850.88
gonna happen

847.92 --> 853.76
that i was gonna fall victim to it i was

850.88 --> 855.6
convinced of it

853.76 --> 857.76
i think that

855.6 --> 860.16
that whole

857.76 --> 862.16
influence that i was convinced of it

860.16 --> 866.639
going through it even has left like

862.16 --> 866.639
several psychosomatic side effects

869.12 --> 871.44
throughout my life

870.72 --> 872.48
for

871.44 --> 874.399
that

872.48 --> 876.72
then i wouldn't even yeah it's like

874.399 --> 877.76
getting a psychosomatic effect subjected

876.72 --> 879.1990000000001
to you

877.76 --> 881.12
about

879.199 --> 884.4799999999999
because of something you don't even

881.12 --> 886.9590000000001
actively remember anymore

884.48 --> 890.32
it's really freaky

886.959 --> 890.3199999999999
anyway i'm still here

890.399 --> 895.6
i haven't taken the i haven't taken the

892.8 --> 897.12
facts i'm not gonna take it

895.6 --> 899.44
and

897.12 --> 900.72
even though i've seen huge amounts of

899.44 --> 902.1600000000001
darkness

900.72 --> 904.0
in my mind

902.16 --> 906.16
through my visions about what was going

904.0 --> 908.72
to happen during this time and there are

906.16 --> 913.8389999999999
people that are subjected to that

908.72 --> 916.1600000000001
it's just i don't think i am going to be

913.839 --> 918.32
not like that

916.16 --> 920.639
because all the hell

918.32 --> 922.399
that i experienced was all based on

920.639 --> 926.9590000000001
people

922.399 --> 931.279
that started out saying yes

926.959 --> 931.279
and i've never said yes to any of it

932.16 --> 938.0
like even during my visions i never said

934.959 --> 941.3599999999999
yes i was just afraid that because i

938.0 --> 944.8
didn't do that that

941.36 --> 946.639
that would somehow magically be turned

944.8 --> 949.199
inside out and that would mean that in

946.639 --> 950.48
the real world i would say yes it's very

949.199 --> 953.92
weird

950.48 --> 957.1990000000001
how that experience dynamic worked on me

953.92 --> 958.399
because i was not

957.199 --> 962.959
fully

958.399 --> 965.199
connected to how i was during the time

962.959 --> 967.5189999999999
where i was viewing

965.199 --> 969.5999999999999
throughout the timescape

967.519 --> 972.72
i did not have a direct

969.6 --> 974.8000000000001
connection to where i was at in my life

972.72 --> 977.519
during that time

974.8 --> 982.4399999999999
it was all based on what i was able to

977.519 --> 982.44
grasp around me throughout the vision

991.44 --> 995.8800000000001
yes steamy traveler i know

996.959 --> 1000.2399999999999
yeah that was my point too

1004.24 --> 1008.399
all right but i'm still here

1006.32 --> 1010.32
and it isn't as bad as i thought it was

1008.399 --> 1012.959
gonna be

1010.32 --> 1015.759
and it's also a matter of letting go the

1012.959 --> 1016.8
fears that i had during that experience

1015.759 --> 1019.6800000000001
that i've

1016.8 --> 1022.8389999999999
held on to well for my life

1019.68 --> 1026.6399999999999
because i thought it was like extremely

1022.839 --> 1027.6000000000001
important when it was happening

1026.64 --> 1029.2800000000002
like

1027.6 --> 1032.839
it was going to determine everything

1029.28 --> 1032.839
that's what i thought

1038.0 --> 1041.52
but i think that

1039.679 --> 1044.799
in a large part of it

1041.52 --> 1047.199
during my vision it was just me being

1044.799 --> 1049.36
grappled by demons being tricked and i

1047.199 --> 1052.4
didn't

1049.36 --> 1054.8799999999999
i failed in a sense that i couldn't dis

1052.4 --> 1057.2
didn't figure out what was going on but

1054.88 --> 1059.5200000000002
i didn't feel in the sense that i didn't

1057.2 --> 1062.48
actually [ __ ] during any of it i always

1059.52 --> 1063.28
stayed true to my own

1062.48 --> 1065.44
like

1063.28 --> 1068.32
intuitive principles

1065.44 --> 1070.0800000000002
i always stayed me i never

1068.32 --> 1072.559
gave myself up

1070.08 --> 1074.1599999999999
during the entire process no matter how

1072.559 --> 1077.799
painful or

1074.16 --> 1077.799
scary it was

1093.12 --> 1097.6
maybe the actual test was that you were

1095.2 --> 1098.72
tricked by peer pressure to not take the

1097.6 --> 1101.52
vaccine

1098.72 --> 1101.52
and you filled it

1101.84 --> 1105.9189999999999
that's

1103.6 --> 1107.039
yeah but

1105.919 --> 1111.2800000000002
the way

1107.039 --> 1113.36
it it has all rolled out by what people

1111.28 --> 1116.48
it doesn't matter

1113.36 --> 1119.1999999999998
because based on just earthly logic

1116.48 --> 1121.039
principles nobody should ever do that

1119.2 --> 1122.48
for any reason whether it's peer

1121.039 --> 1126.16
pressure

1122.48 --> 1126.16
or what else doesn't matter

1127.039 --> 1131.039
but maybe the demons thought that i

1129.44 --> 1133.52
failed the test

1131.039 --> 1136.48
they certainly seem to act like that

1133.52 --> 1138.8799999999999
afterward in the last last phases of the

1136.48 --> 1138.88
vision

1139.36 --> 1144.559
they were all just kind of like

1141.52 --> 1146.96
leaving me alone i felt really

1144.559 --> 1149.28
like it was all still around me

1146.96 --> 1151.44
and silent i felt like they're like it

1149.28 --> 1154.32
was almost like a desert except it was

1151.44 --> 1156.799
in the desert was just

1154.32 --> 1160.559
here but it was like in the last phases

1156.799 --> 1160.559
i was kind of like dwelling around

1161.84 --> 1164.799
and there was nobody

1163.44 --> 1167.52
no person

1164.799 --> 1171.2
around me nobody had anything planned

1167.52 --> 1171.2
for me nobody tried to trick me

1171.6 --> 1175.84
very weird

1173.039 --> 1175.84
the last phase

1176.559 --> 1183.28
i actually thought that that happened

1179.039 --> 1185.36
because i was a ghost because i was just

1183.28 --> 1188.3999999999999
viewing through

1185.36 --> 1192.9189999999999
post-death experiences that's what

1188.4 --> 1192.919
really right that's ah

1193.919 --> 1197.5200000000002
but

1195.28 --> 1199.76
from another perspective yeah maybe they

1197.52 --> 1201.9189999999999
just left me alone because they couldn't

1199.76 --> 1206.559
get to me anymore

1201.919 --> 1208.7990000000002
because i actually won it's just that

1206.559 --> 1212.0
for some reason i was marked in the

1208.799 --> 1214.6399999999999
experience as my own enemy

1212.0 --> 1216.96
literally like i was there as my own

1214.64 --> 1220.96
enemy and i could not

1216.96 --> 1223.52
undo that angle of approach about it

1220.96 --> 1223.52
crazy

1224.08 --> 1228.6399999999999
i couldn't undo it i couldn't turn it

1226.32 --> 1233.2
off i couldn't like let it go

1228.64 --> 1235.8400000000001
just be me or no i had that one way of

1233.2 --> 1238.88
being through the entire [ __ ] thing

1235.84 --> 1241.84
and i could not stop being like that i

1238.88 --> 1243.1200000000001
could not stop it i had no control over

1241.84 --> 1245.6
my spirit

1243.12 --> 1245.6
in a way

1246.48 --> 1253.76
didn't have the normal earthly dynamics

1250.48 --> 1256.32
that i have in the waking world

1253.76 --> 1258.32
and it [ __ ] me up by the way

1256.32 --> 1260.559
[ __ ] me up that i did not have that

1258.32 --> 1263.36
dynamics through the entire experience

1260.559 --> 1267.039
it's left like scarring

1263.36 --> 1267.039
in my spirit throughout my life

1268.0 --> 1273.36
that sounds all very dark

1270.96 --> 1273.3600000000001
anyway

1275.52 --> 1279.1589999999999
low flip flat

1308.96 --> 1311.28
yep

1312.559 --> 1315.6
well that

1313.6 --> 1318.08
well matthew hall that what you

1315.6 --> 1321.1999999999998
described seems the earthly test it's

1318.08 --> 1323.12
the test on earth

1321.2 --> 1324.559
a lot of what i was doing through the

1323.12 --> 1325.6
vision

1324.559 --> 1328.559
it

1325.6 --> 1332.48
it really was the other dimension it

1328.559 --> 1335.039
wasn't most of it wasn't about this

1332.48 --> 1339.039
it wasn't about this

1335.039 --> 1340.32
it was about the sub

1339.039 --> 1343.12
thing

1340.32 --> 1346.3999999999999
the other dimension the other

1343.12 --> 1349.039
like the guiding lines it's so hard to

1346.4 --> 1351.679
describe what that is

1349.039 --> 1354.679
it's like i was supposed to be managing

1351.679 --> 1354.679
things

1360.559 --> 1365.12
it was insanely surreal in ways

1366.0 --> 1370.32
it's just

1368.799 --> 1372.84
it's like

1370.32 --> 1376.96
if i would have to compare

1372.84 --> 1378.799
it it is like a psychosis

1376.96 --> 1381.2
except

1378.799 --> 1382.08
you stay in it

1381.2 --> 1384.72
and

1382.08 --> 1387.4399999999998
you don't have like

1384.72 --> 1389.6000000000001
terrible emotion like it did i wasn't

1387.44 --> 1392.3200000000002
overwhelmed by emotions during anything

1389.6 --> 1395.1999999999998
i did have some emotions

1392.32 --> 1397.36
but they just enough in order for to

1395.2 --> 1399.28
sense them right i did i was never

1397.36 --> 1402.559
overwhelmed

1399.28 --> 1405.12
i was just driven crazy by all the

1402.559 --> 1407.6789999999999
information really

1405.12 --> 1411.12
but it was never like totally over i

1407.679 --> 1413.919
wasn't like oh my god i'm breaking

1411.12 --> 1415.84
because i'm so burdened by the emotions

1413.919 --> 1418.72
of everything i've experienced no that

1415.84 --> 1418.72
wasn't happening

1419.76 --> 1427.44
instead it would like force my mind

1424.32 --> 1428.8799999999999
part to take action

1427.44 --> 1433.279
like

1428.88 --> 1433.279
ah it's so hard to describe i

1435.6 --> 1438.8799999999999
it was an entirely different way of

1438.0 --> 1440.48
being

1438.88 --> 1444.72
it really was

1440.48 --> 1447.2
it's nothing like what it is to just be

1444.72 --> 1450.0
a normal time-bound

1447.2 --> 1450.0
human being

1451.679 --> 1456.2
it lasted so freaking long

1463.76 --> 1468.1589999999999
like an energetic spiritual plane but

1466.24 --> 1469.52
dark yeah well that's why i call it the

1468.159 --> 1471.919
dark world

1469.52 --> 1472.6399999999999
right when i say dark world it's based

1471.919 --> 1474.64
on

1472.64 --> 1476.159
everything i saw there

1474.64 --> 1479.2
and

1476.159 --> 1481.3600000000001
yeah the prismatic lights they were

1479.2 --> 1484.0
taken off

1481.36 --> 1484.8799999999999
like very early on

1484.0 --> 1488.96
they

1484.88 --> 1488.96
yeah it's so freaky but

1490.08 --> 1497.36
when i first entered the dark world

1493.36 --> 1499.6789999999999
somehow i i slipped in i

1497.36 --> 1501.76
literally experienced that like i was

1499.679 --> 1504.48
ascending into the dark

1501.76 --> 1507.52
like an angel

1504.48 --> 1510.0
all lit up like i was giving off my own

1507.52 --> 1512.559
light and i ascended into the darkness

1510.0 --> 1512.559
onto a

1513.2 --> 1518.4
dark floor

1514.96 --> 1518.4
and that's where i met well

1520.4 --> 1525.8400000000001
a specific person that's like

1523.679 --> 1528.799
was assigned like some kind of a guide

1525.84 --> 1530.799
but he was messed up but he was a guide

1528.799 --> 1534.32
and it's i don't care to go into too

1530.799 --> 1537.039
much detail it's very creepy

1534.32 --> 1539.9189999999999
he still looked human was not like a

1537.039 --> 1541.84
devil or anything no it was all kind of

1539.919 --> 1543.76
human but

1541.84 --> 1544.559
then at some point

1543.76 --> 1546.96
like

1544.559 --> 1548.72
things were explained to me like he was

1546.96 --> 1552.4
instructing me what was going to happen

1548.72 --> 1555.52
he was kind of showing off the powers of

1552.4 --> 1555.52
the simulation

1555.76 --> 1560.559
in the dark world how easy it is to just

1557.84 --> 1562.8799999999999
quickly reconstruct things and then

1560.559 --> 1566.0
virtually manifest them and it's like a

1562.88 --> 1568.0800000000002
holodeck and he was using my memory and

1566.0 --> 1570.72
it was even showing me

1568.08 --> 1573.039
how he was doing that

1570.72 --> 1574.72
but then after

1573.039 --> 1578.559
we like

1574.72 --> 1580.96
i was sent to meet somebody

1578.559 --> 1584.3999999999999
right he pulled somebody in that

1580.96 --> 1585.679
identified themselves as god but that's

1584.4 --> 1588.159
a lie

1585.679 --> 1590.88
and i didn't really believe him but i

1588.159 --> 1594.96
was very curious i was like wow

1590.88 --> 1594.96
something actually calls himself that

1596.08 --> 1600.1589999999999
and i was not convinced that he was like

1598.72 --> 1602.08
he even

1600.159 --> 1604.0
because it was a he was how it was

1602.08 --> 1606.3999999999999
represented

1604.0 --> 1609.2
like black santa big

1606.4 --> 1612.64
white skinned but totally in black with

1609.2 --> 1614.0800000000002
beard and

1612.64 --> 1616.3200000000002
weird

1614.08 --> 1618.72
weird guy that i've never that i don't

1616.32 --> 1620.799
remember ever having met in person in

1618.72 --> 1623.44
the physical world

1620.799 --> 1626.24
and he tried to give a demonstration how

1623.44 --> 1628.4
he was god by showing off yeah his

1626.24 --> 1631.2
skills with virtual

1628.4 --> 1634.88
mechanics and it was just i saw through

1631.2 --> 1637.039
it so much it was just like embarrassed

1634.88 --> 1638.88
i was embarrassed that he thought that

1637.039 --> 1640.64
he could convince me that he was god

1638.88 --> 1642.88
with that

1640.64 --> 1644.0800000000002
right

1642.88 --> 1646.64
but

1644.08 --> 1648.8799999999999
yeah that didn't mean he went away

1646.64 --> 1650.64
because apparently he was also assigned

1648.88 --> 1652.3990000000001
in some way that he didn't really tell

1650.64 --> 1656.159
me

1652.399 --> 1658.8799999999999
and he was the one that

1656.159 --> 1660.64
at some point i was like pulled into

1658.88 --> 1663.279
another part

1660.64 --> 1665.679
like into an open realm or something and

1663.279 --> 1668.96
everything was like super prismatic and

1665.679 --> 1671.039
like rainbow colors came from everything

1668.96 --> 1673.6000000000001
i guess it could be compared to like a

1671.039 --> 1675.36
giant lsd trip that was what i was

1673.6 --> 1678.0
suddenly seeing as i kind of stepped

1675.36 --> 1678.0
through a door

1678.159 --> 1680.88
into another place

1680.0 --> 1684.559
like

1680.88 --> 1688.24
outside of my mind perhaps

1684.559 --> 1688.24
in the more outer space

1689.12 --> 1692.6399999999999
but then they

1690.72 --> 1695.64
like

1692.64 --> 1695.64
put

1696.32 --> 1701.76
something in my head like

1699.12 --> 1702.8799999999999
i could literally feel like a virtual

1701.76 --> 1704.48
hand just

1702.88 --> 1706.96
like

1704.48 --> 1708.799
i didn't have a physical body there so

1706.96 --> 1710.96
they could literally with their just

1708.799 --> 1712.72
reach their hand like

1710.96 --> 1714.88
through the middle of my eyes

1712.72 --> 1716.48
theoretically just through it it was

1714.88 --> 1718.159
just the spirit

1716.48 --> 1720.96
really weird

1718.159 --> 1722.96
it was it wasn't even it was scary in a

1720.96 --> 1724.48
way because i didn't know what what was

1722.96 --> 1726.72
going to happen

1724.48 --> 1728.32
but it wasn't painful nothing and they

1726.72 --> 1730.799
kind of like

1728.32 --> 1732.8799999999999
put this film or something like this

1730.799 --> 1734.96
polaroid thing

1732.88 --> 1736.88
inside of my head and suddenly the

1734.96 --> 1739.2
prismatic lights would go away and

1736.88 --> 1742.88
that's when it became the dark world and

1739.2 --> 1745.2
hadn't changed back after that point

1742.88 --> 1747.5200000000002
because with all the prismatics couldn't

1745.2 --> 1751.559
really see anything super sharp but it

1747.52 --> 1751.559
was delightful though

1759.12 --> 1764.84
all right anyway this is so

1761.52 --> 1764.84
kind of trippy

1767.52 --> 1773.52
but yeah just what happened back then

1770.64 --> 1775.6000000000001
and what it turned into and how i just

1773.52 --> 1778.799
have like proof

1775.6 --> 1782.48
to myself that i literally experienced

1778.799 --> 1785.039
through time it's like unforgettable

1782.48 --> 1787.279
and maybe it's a curse i think often

1785.039 --> 1790.48
that if i just hadn't done it i would

1787.279 --> 1792.48
have had a much more

1790.48 --> 1795.84
cohesive

1792.48 --> 1795.84
strong life

1803.039 --> 1809.76
and in ways i yeah i regret it but then

1806.84 --> 1813.039
again a lot of the things that drove me

1809.76 --> 1815.84
to that point were based on fear of

1813.039 --> 1819.039
dying of not being able to

1815.84 --> 1819.039
use my talents

1819.44 --> 1824.88
because i threw the other dimensions the

1821.84 --> 1826.799
demons had warned me like

1824.88 --> 1828.64
we're going to kill you we're going to

1826.799 --> 1831.279
kill you because you are too much of a

1828.64 --> 1834.88
threat we are going to

1831.279 --> 1836.64
prevent you from reaching that point

1834.88 --> 1838.64
unless you

1836.64 --> 1841.919
turn to her so that's

1838.64 --> 1844.88
yeah all right yeah i had like a like

1841.919 --> 1847.3600000000001
sith lords practically in my freaking

1844.88 --> 1850.48
dreams and nightmares and through other

1847.36 --> 1852.32
people come to me and basically say join

1850.48 --> 1855.52
us or die

1852.32 --> 1858.559
and there is no other option like i felt

1855.52 --> 1860.24
whether it was manipulated or not i felt

1858.559 --> 1863.039
like

1860.24 --> 1865.76
either i just give up everything

1863.039 --> 1866.799
for purity and then i don't have that

1865.76 --> 1868.72
life

1866.799 --> 1871.519
or i somehow

1868.72 --> 1872.72
some crazy way have to find a way

1871.519 --> 1875.1200000000001
through it

1872.72 --> 1879.6000000000001
and that's what i attempted because i

1875.12 --> 1880.9599999999998
was not ready to give up my life

1879.6 --> 1883.1999999999998
and that was

1880.96 --> 1884.0
yeah maybe my biggest mistake of all

1883.2 --> 1886.48
time

1884.0 --> 1888.96
because i didn't really know for sure

1886.48 --> 1892.48
that they were going to do that

1888.96 --> 1894.799
i just felt convinced that it was gonna

1892.48 --> 1894.799
happen

1895.919 --> 1901.679
and i often i have no evidence

1899.12 --> 1904.2399999999998
no evidence that it would happen

1901.679 --> 1906.3990000000001
if i hadn't bought into it they could

1904.24 --> 1908.96
have just literally walked away and left

1906.399 --> 1908.9599999999998
me alone

1909.919 --> 1914.64
and i think

1911.12 --> 1917.5189999999998
at an earlier point that even happened

1914.64 --> 1920.3200000000002
it even happened and then my freaking

1917.519 --> 1922.72
amnesia kicked in

1920.32 --> 1923.9189999999999
and it's like i became curious over

1922.72 --> 1926.559
again

1923.919 --> 1928.3200000000002
it's like the darkness tried to trick me

1926.559 --> 1929.84
like ah we're going to take everything

1928.32 --> 1930.96
from you we're going to kill you if you

1929.84 --> 1932.72
don't

1930.96 --> 1935.039
do what we say

1932.72 --> 1938.64
and then the first time i was like huh

1935.039 --> 1940.24
that's hilarious i don't believe you

1938.64 --> 1942.159
but then later

1940.24 --> 1945.279
i was like

1942.159 --> 1947.519
but now i know you exist you exist and

1945.279 --> 1951.36
that you have this you're doing this

1947.519 --> 1951.36
thing and i became curious

1953.12 --> 1959.1999999999998
i became curious again and i started to

1956.159 --> 1961.519
seek it out because

1959.2 --> 1965.279
of the confrontation it's like

1961.519 --> 1965.279
it wouldn't leave me alone in my mind

1973.84 --> 1977.84
like

1974.96 --> 1977.8400000000001
yeah

1979.519 --> 1983.919
it was my mind that pulled me back in i

1981.84 --> 1989.24
couldn't help it because now i knew that

1983.919 --> 1989.24
this insanity existed out there

1991.2 --> 1996.64
and so i sought it out

1994.24 --> 1998.72
which was like the dumbest [ __ ] thing

1996.64 --> 2001.6000000000001
i've ever done and

1998.72 --> 2003.279
i've imagined many many

2001.6 --> 2006.08
hours on end

2003.279 --> 2008.32
throughout my life of beating myself up

2006.08 --> 2009.279
through those times to just be like

2008.32 --> 2010.32
no

2009.279 --> 2012.559
no

2010.32 --> 2015.36
no you're gonna [ __ ] leave this alone

2012.559 --> 2016.8799999999999
you stupid piece of [ __ ]

2015.36 --> 2019.6
leave it alone

2016.88 --> 2021.6000000000001
don't think about that it's stupid it's

2019.6 --> 2024.1589999999999
just stupid it's just bad you're

2021.6 --> 2026.08
literally just getting obsessed over

2024.159 --> 2028.72
damaging yourself

2026.08 --> 2030.72
because you're [ __ ] stupid

2028.72 --> 2033.76
leave it alone leave it alone leave it

2030.72 --> 2038.32
alone leave it alone

2033.76 --> 2040.799
how many times have i fantasized that

2038.32 --> 2042.559
after all this [ __ ] rolled out after i

2040.799 --> 2045.36
had been scarred

2042.559 --> 2049.399
in my spirit through that crazy crazy

2045.36 --> 2049.399
experience 80 years

2064.56 --> 2070.96
no that isn't gonna happen now surface

2066.879 --> 2070.96
day decided he's a scumbag now

2072.8 --> 2079.44
and he's never gonna let go of his weird

2075.599 --> 2082.079
paranoid obsessions that he's attained

2079.44 --> 2082.079
this time

2085.04 --> 2088.48
yeah i have nothing to apologize for

2087.2 --> 2091.6789999999996
service day

2088.48 --> 2095.76
you called me a liar okay [ __ ] you

2091.679 --> 2097.92
did for no bloody reason

2095.76 --> 2102.5200000000004
and you're not even willing to

2097.92 --> 2102.52
understand that fact

2105.599 --> 2110.0
no i don't go twist it around you

2107.76 --> 2112.1600000000003
literally said it

2110.0 --> 2115.359
and you doubled down on it

2112.16 --> 2117.5989999999997
you even gave references for it and it

2115.359 --> 2120.0
showed you're a lunatic

2117.599 --> 2121.44
you're out of your [ __ ] mind you

2120.0 --> 2124.0
can't even

2121.44 --> 2126.64
create a coherent thought directed

2124.0 --> 2129.04
towards me

2126.64 --> 2131.359
oh he said sun is not holographic wow

2129.04 --> 2132.88
that's the evidence then i guess

2131.359 --> 2136.3199999999997
because

2132.88 --> 2138.4
fpv angel is the ultimate arbiter

2136.32 --> 2140.1600000000003
right he's the one that's exploring

2138.4 --> 2142.56
exactly

2140.16 --> 2144.0789999999997
what could be possible

2142.56 --> 2146.96
yeah

2144.079 --> 2149.6800000000003
i mean he is the arbiter of course of

2146.96 --> 2152.16
course so yeah fpv

2149.68 --> 2156.0
said it's not holographic so that means

2152.16 --> 2156.0
i'm a liar does it huh

2156.4 --> 2161.839
they even have proof right yes of course

2159.839 --> 2163.7599999999998
they do

2161.839 --> 2166.32
yeah i don't want you here anymore get

2163.76 --> 2168.6400000000003
the [ __ ] out of here scum

2166.32 --> 2170.839
it was good to know you well it yeah you

2168.64 --> 2172.64
were still saying i don't want you here

2170.839 --> 2176.24
anymore

2172.64 --> 2176.24
you repulse me now

2183.599 --> 2187.76
i don't want to deal with this i'm not

2185.52 --> 2189.839
gonna even try to make you see sense

2187.76 --> 2192.88
anymore

2189.839 --> 2195.68
if you can't overcome this [ __ ] that

2192.88 --> 2199.6400000000003
you've contracted on the inside

2195.68 --> 2199.64
i don't want you here anymore

2209.359 --> 2213.359
you called me a liar and that's the

2211.599 --> 2216.88
gravest insult

2213.359 --> 2217.7599999999998
somebody in your position could make

2216.88 --> 2220.1600000000003
and

2217.76 --> 2222.88
you're not forgiven

2220.16 --> 2223.92
you don't even recognize it you still

2222.88 --> 2225.92
think

2223.92 --> 2228.32
you did the right thing

2225.92 --> 2232.04
so you're [ __ ] out of your mind and i

2228.32 --> 2232.04
don't want you here anymore

2239.99 --> 2243.0899999999997
[Music]

2246.8 --> 2249.8
uh

2256.4 --> 2259.4
so

2293.599 --> 2298.32
yeah steamy traveler no but

2295.68 --> 2301.7599999999998
i don't think he can

2298.32 --> 2301.76
deal with what i do

2303.119 --> 2306.96
i mean

2305.28 --> 2309.119
he's had some

2306.96 --> 2310.88
stability problems

2309.119 --> 2313.28
and he dealt with them and i thought it

2310.88 --> 2315.76
was behind him and

2313.28 --> 2315.76
it isn't

2320.079 --> 2324.32
i'm not gonna

2321.68 --> 2327.2799999999997
yeah he went over lines that he should

2324.32 --> 2329.76
never have gone across it's just to to

2327.28 --> 2329.76
use

2330.32 --> 2334.0
i don't even want to get into it he just

2332.24 --> 2335.5989999999997
went over lines he should have never

2334.0 --> 2338.64
done that

2335.599 --> 2341.839
and there's nothing i can do about it

2338.64 --> 2341.839
he seems unrepentant

2342.88 --> 2347.56
and i don't want to deal with it anymore

2345.44 --> 2349.28
and i don't want to hear him say that

2347.56 --> 2351.2799999999997
disgusting

2349.28 --> 2354.7200000000003
savogne remark

2351.28 --> 2356.96
oh you know what you did like

2354.72 --> 2358.9599999999996
dude you don't even know what the [ __ ] i

2356.96 --> 2361.839
did you don't know what you're talking

2358.96 --> 2363.2
about you have a psychotically infused

2361.839 --> 2365.359
feeling

2363.2 --> 2370.0789999999997
that has no connection to physical

2365.359 --> 2372.4
reality and you seem unable to let it go

2370.079 --> 2374.88
and i don't want to be subjected to that

2372.4 --> 2374.88
anymore

2375.04 --> 2378.68
i'm done with it

2382.32 --> 2384.6400000000003
yep

2385.76 --> 2388.32
this is just like

2387.359 --> 2390.56
that

2388.32 --> 2393.04
crazy tony guy

2390.56 --> 2395.44
that's like super paranoid attacking

2393.04 --> 2396.48
everybody it's that [ __ ]

2395.44 --> 2398.56
yeah

2396.48 --> 2400.8
it's the worst it's the worst place you

2398.56 --> 2403.68
can end up with it's total full-on

2400.8 --> 2405.8390000000004
paranoids of vognier mode

2403.68 --> 2407.9199999999996
he's got it in him

2405.839 --> 2410.319
if you got that in you you're not

2407.92 --> 2414.0
welcome here i don't care how good a

2410.319 --> 2415.839
friend we were you're not welcome here

2414.0 --> 2418.48
if you got that in you and you don't

2415.839 --> 2421.839
want that in you so yeah you should take

2418.48 --> 2425.04
care to avoid people that are like that

2421.839 --> 2427.7599999999998
and that will conjure up that feeling

2425.04 --> 2429.839
that way of being inside of you

2427.76 --> 2432.0
and that's why you should avoid

2429.839 --> 2433.119
crazy

2432.0 --> 2435.119
like

2433.119 --> 2438.92
seriously

2435.119 --> 2438.92
paranoid inducing

2439.2 --> 2444.56
youtubers like that

2441.92 --> 2446.8
i mean i get pretty savage here

2444.56 --> 2449.839
sometimes i get a little bit over

2446.8 --> 2453.04
enthusiastic perhaps especially

2449.839 --> 2455.839
in like a justice sense get pretty

2453.04 --> 2458.96
brutal right

2455.839 --> 2462.0789999999997
but i don't start just conjuring up

2458.96 --> 2465.2
paranoid illusions about people which is

2462.079 --> 2466.6400000000003
what they do is the cevanier

2465.2 --> 2469.2799999999997
syndrome

2466.64 --> 2473.52
i don't do that and you should avoid

2469.28 --> 2477.0400000000004
that at all cost because it it gnaws on

2473.52 --> 2478.8
your soul it changes you if you sit

2477.04 --> 2481.92
through that

2478.8 --> 2483.52
paranoia will get to you if you sit

2481.92 --> 2485.52
through that

2483.52 --> 2488.319
you should avoid it at all cost and some

2485.52 --> 2490.319
people out there they don't

2488.319 --> 2491.599
they don't avoid it and so they

2490.319 --> 2495.2
constantly

2491.599 --> 2496.88
roll back in the [ __ ] and then oh

2495.2 --> 2500.319
surprise surprise they become all

2496.88 --> 2502.56
paranoid again yeah

2500.319 --> 2504.96
right this even happened to good servant

2502.56 --> 2508.72
and good servant is like the

2504.96 --> 2511.92
naturally nicest person ever

2508.72 --> 2514.319
and he gets caught away he gets carried

2511.92 --> 2517.599
away by that [ __ ] even

2514.319 --> 2520.079
because he yeah he kept he hung around

2517.599 --> 2522.8
that a lot

2520.079 --> 2525.599
right an agm for example

2522.8 --> 2527.76
great guy but at times he gets super

2525.599 --> 2530.1600000000003
paranoid carried away

2527.76 --> 2532.4
overreactive and then he goes for

2530.16 --> 2533.92
sylvania but he knows it about himself

2532.4 --> 2535.6800000000003
now

2533.92 --> 2539.04
and

2535.68 --> 2541.04
yeah i think he's become a better man

2539.04 --> 2543.92
because of that because he's just

2541.04 --> 2545.7599999999998
dealing with it with how that works

2543.92 --> 2548.839
right

2545.76 --> 2550.8
yeah and service day

2548.839 --> 2552.88
two

2550.8 --> 2554.8
and he's even like when he came to visit

2552.88 --> 2557.359
the last time

2554.8 --> 2560.8
he even we talked about that how that

2557.359 --> 2563.68
was and we were both so happy that he'd

2560.8 --> 2566.2400000000002
been pulled out of that and how much

2563.68 --> 2567.7599999999998
wiser he was like i could feel it like

2566.24 --> 2569.5989999999997
this guy has

2567.76 --> 2572.0
wisdom strength now

2569.599 --> 2574.0
but for some reason after that point he

2572.0 --> 2576.88
just

2574.0 --> 2579.28
stumbled right back into the [ __ ]

2576.88 --> 2581.04
again maybe not as deep as it used to be

2579.28 --> 2583.28
before for him

2581.04 --> 2585.119
because he's dwelled in dark places i'm

2583.28 --> 2586.6400000000003
not gonna talk about that

2585.119 --> 2588.319
but

2586.64 --> 2589.7599999999998
he's still

2588.319 --> 2592.64
like that

2589.76 --> 2594.7200000000003
and it's unacceptable

2592.64 --> 2598.0
like i will not

2594.72 --> 2600.56
kneel to anybody that acts like that for

2598.0 --> 2601.52
any reason ever

2600.56 --> 2603.44
ever

2601.52 --> 2606.319
never out of principle

2603.44 --> 2608.64
i will never do that

2606.319 --> 2610.4
doesn't matter how good of a perceived

2608.64 --> 2612.64
friend you are

2610.4 --> 2615.599
from my perspective or yours i will

2612.64 --> 2618.64
never kneel to that ever

2615.599 --> 2621.839
i cannot allow myself to do that under

2618.64 --> 2621.839
any circumstances

2645.68 --> 2650.56
yeah hello by the way getting wisdom

2648.0 --> 2652.0
thank you good to see you

2650.56 --> 2654.319
logan's run

2652.0 --> 2657.64
ranty what two

2654.319 --> 2657.64
to what

2666.24 --> 2672.64
straight lines can curve

2668.319 --> 2672.64
in globe tardia yeah yeah of course

2673.359 --> 2678.48
it's

2674.839 --> 2682.7599999999998
more in the direction of all curved

2678.48 --> 2682.76
lines are actually straight

2690.88 --> 2696.4
so everything that in the model is

2692.8 --> 2696.4
curved in reality is straight

2699.28 --> 2705.8390000000004
it's a it's a big suspense of disbelief

2702.079 --> 2705.8390000000004
anyway hello dx

2744.16 --> 2749.92
and globally is a disco ball

2747.119 --> 2752.56
yeah the locally flat idea but it's just

2749.92 --> 2754.96
ridiculous though

2752.56 --> 2757.96
but you can still use it as an excuse

2754.96 --> 2757.96
temporarily

2775.04 --> 2780.319
you may steal that speech from me

2778.079 --> 2780.319
what

2782.079 --> 2785.4
what speech

2806.72 --> 2812.16
but okay logan's run but does he

2809.28 --> 2815.28
actually believe that though

2812.16 --> 2817.839
or is that just his current position

2815.28 --> 2817.8390000000004
narrative

2835.28 --> 2839.0
flat is freeing

2846.16 --> 2850.48
oh

2847.2 --> 2854.5989999999997
a flatter sage thank you

2850.48 --> 2854.599
i'll check it out

2858.16 --> 2861.68
oh

2859.28 --> 2861.6800000000003
nice

2862.559 --> 2866.079
man

2864.48 --> 2868.319
he's sending me a lot of paypals

2866.079 --> 2870.8
recently i really appreciate that man

2868.319 --> 2874.72
flatter sage

2870.8 --> 2874.7200000000003
i mean you're helping me out a lot

2875.28 --> 2879.3590000000004
because i thought it was going to be a

2876.72 --> 2881.7599999999998
pretty bleak month

2879.359 --> 2884.319
financial wise but yeah thanks to your

2881.76 --> 2885.2000000000003
support and others i am like pulling

2884.319 --> 2888.4
through

2885.2 --> 2888.3999999999996
so thank you so much

2888.559 --> 2893.28
granty is a lying drug what

2891.04 --> 2896.839
are you sure is he like drinking alcohol

2893.28 --> 2896.8390000000004
on shows now

2900.079 --> 2902.559
crockett

2909.119 --> 2914.599
i have to have a flat working model

2925.18 --> 2929.5989999999997
[Music]

2927.359 --> 2932.5589999999997
the problem is is that all the map

2929.599 --> 2935.119
projections we have are technically all

2932.559 --> 2937.28
celestial projections they're all based

2935.119 --> 2939.52
on celestial

2937.28 --> 2941.52
on the celestial sphere

2939.52 --> 2945.359
the apparent celestial sphere that's how

2941.52 --> 2946.96
the maps are all made and projected

2945.359 --> 2948.96
so the land is always going to be

2946.96 --> 2951.599
secondary and that means

2948.96 --> 2954.7200000000003
it's kind of like bound to

2951.599 --> 2958.0
well the apparent celestial sphere

2954.72 --> 2961.68
and how it arranges itself

2958.0 --> 2961.68
in relation to the earth right

2962.24 --> 2965.52
and yeah that's

2963.76 --> 2968.0
that's just a problem

2965.52 --> 2970.72
we don't really have the capability to

2968.0 --> 2973.28
overcome right now

2970.72 --> 2976.72
because all the map projections that we

2973.28 --> 2980.2400000000002
have like all of it is all based

2976.72 --> 2982.0789999999997
on the celestial sphere all of it

2980.24 --> 2984.72
none of it is actually

2982.079 --> 2986.4
leaving the celestials out of it and

2984.72 --> 2991.2
just

2986.4 --> 2991.2000000000003
sizing up the land as is

2992.319 --> 2996.8
right that would be a whole different

2994.24 --> 2999.2799999999997
way of map making it would rather be a

2996.8 --> 3002.4
scan model like the only way to do it is

2999.28 --> 3004.6400000000003
to literally just scan everything

3002.4 --> 3005.6800000000003
everything

3004.64 --> 3007.68
land

3005.68 --> 3011.5989999999997
ocean bottom

3007.68 --> 3014.5589999999997
everything just one giant interlocking

3011.599 --> 3016.8
scan data

3014.559 --> 3018.559
result

3016.8 --> 3020.559
and then yeah you would like the

3018.559 --> 3022.8
celestials are not involved in that it's

3020.559 --> 3024.88
just like a puzzle of

3022.8 --> 3026.6400000000003
scanned land

3024.88 --> 3028.48
and that's the only way to kind of

3026.64 --> 3032.0789999999997
bypass

3028.48 --> 3034.4
well using celestial sphere-based map

3032.079 --> 3037.7200000000003
projections which is what all maps we

3034.4 --> 3037.7200000000003
know are

3042.24 --> 3044.72
yeah

3043.119 --> 3046.2400000000002
all right flatter stage i really

3044.72 --> 3050.2
appreciate it dude

3046.24 --> 3050.2
thank you cheers

3062.8 --> 3065.8
hmm

3068.559 --> 3072.1600000000003
yeah he's hearing birds too

3074.559 --> 3079.52
like google earth well like all maps all

3076.72 --> 3082.9599999999996
the maps we know they're all

3079.52 --> 3086.559
based on the celestial sphere

3082.96 --> 3086.559
like that's the primary

3087.839 --> 3095.16
all that you get to see the earth

3090.559 --> 3095.1600000000003
in the maps is all secondary

3100.8 --> 3104.96
right so if you want a primary

3105.28 --> 3108.7200000000003
sourced

3107.52 --> 3111.28
knowledge

3108.72 --> 3114.16
that the primary source data about the

3111.28 --> 3117.8390000000004
land you're gonna have to use scans and

3114.16 --> 3117.839
then just puzzle them together

3118.24 --> 3122.9599999999996
right like literally puzzle them

3120.559 --> 3122.96
together

3123.2 --> 3127.2
and that that's the only way that i

3124.96 --> 3130.0
could envision

3127.2 --> 3133.4399999999996
where you can bypass celestial sphere

3130.0 --> 3133.44
based projection maps

3136.079 --> 3141.319
hello cycle thank you

3156.4 --> 3158.64
oh

3159.2 --> 3163.319
wow so right

3169.68 --> 3172.7999999999997
look at that

3171.28 --> 3175.2000000000003
now that's a

3172.8 --> 3178.92
dutch sky

3175.2 --> 3178.9199999999996
and they're just amazing

3203.119 --> 3206.44
hey kitty

3218.0 --> 3223.839
yeah kitty you've been lazy

3220.72 --> 3223.839
but that's okay

3242.48 --> 3247.44
strange sound fluctuation

3245.44 --> 3250.599
or that maybe because i wasn't facing

3247.44 --> 3250.599
the mic

3252.079 --> 3255.079
do

3271.44 --> 3277.7200000000003
all right thanks logan's run

3274.559 --> 3277.7200000000003
see ya

3292.45 --> 3295.52
[Music]

3296.48 --> 3299.599
all right fluffy snow

3304.839 --> 3312.88
thanks yeah it's nice

3308.4 --> 3312.88
i really appreciate you guys and gals

3317.359 --> 3323.2
because it did feel like a bit grim

3319.28 --> 3323.2000000000003
today but now i feel great

3331.599 --> 3336.319
it's just this just this weird thing you

3334.079 --> 3336.319
know

3336.559 --> 3342.48
i'm an empath

3339.2 --> 3344.3999999999996
and i use that to analyze how things

3342.48 --> 3346.799
play out and how it'll is going to

3344.4 --> 3349.76
influence the masses

3346.799 --> 3350.64
so i'm sizing up the masses in my own

3349.76 --> 3353.44
way

3350.64 --> 3356.0
it's very certain ways

3353.44 --> 3358.16
but yeah when you then realize that like

3356.0 --> 3359.76
everybody is getting psychologically

3358.16 --> 3362.96
attacked and then you spend a lot of

3359.76 --> 3366.2400000000002
time trying to figure out how

3362.96 --> 3367.04
it's really really tough to not in some

3366.24 --> 3369.1189999999997
way

3367.04 --> 3370.72
get caught up in it

3369.119 --> 3373.6800000000003
like suddenly

3370.72 --> 3376.319
lose the realization that it is

3373.68 --> 3378.5589999999997
not real and that you're studying it and

3376.319 --> 3381.119
then suddenly you might snap into like

3378.559 --> 3381.119
it's real

3381.68 --> 3385.2799999999997
right

3382.559 --> 3388.2400000000002
to certain levels like not like oh my

3385.28 --> 3390.799
god i'm gonna believe that the voice now

3388.24 --> 3392.64
or that kind of nonsense no but it

3390.799 --> 3394.799
as in like

3392.64 --> 3396.799
wait they're not actually winning

3394.799 --> 3398.72
they're doing this out of desperation

3396.799 --> 3400.24
their psychological tactics aren't

3398.72 --> 3403.2
working

3400.24 --> 3406.0
the panic is just high

3403.2 --> 3408.72
and but then you might still get caught

3406.0 --> 3410.559
up like oh my god they like we might

3408.72 --> 3413.4399999999996
have been wrong they might actually be

3410.559 --> 3416.0
winning everybody's going to go insane

3413.44 --> 3419.359
right that sort of feeling and then i

3416.0 --> 3422.559
have to like no no no

3419.359 --> 3422.5589999999997
don't get caught up now

3431.28 --> 3437.28
what am i gonna do with my day

3434.4 --> 3440.96
what i do with every day

3437.28 --> 3440.96
take over the world

3444.88 --> 3450.6400000000003
no it's just uh

3446.799 --> 3450.64
it's a sunday so i'm gonna

3451.52 --> 3457.24
i don't know what i'm gonna do

3453.28 --> 3457.2400000000002
watch a bit of own benjamin

3470.0 --> 3475.28
yeah i'm not gonna

3471.76 --> 3478.1600000000003
do that i'm not gonna apologize

3475.28 --> 3479.52
to somebody that called me a liar for no

3478.16 --> 3484.0
damn reason

3479.52 --> 3484.0
and refuses to apologize to me for it

3485.2 --> 3491.52
refuses to lay down that they might have

3488.559 --> 3493.76
overreacted

3491.52 --> 3493.7599999999998
right

3498.319 --> 3505.92
when hey when i overreact

3501.76 --> 3505.92
i apologize for it quite quickly

3506.16 --> 3512.0
right and i tried to explain

3508.559 --> 3515.2000000000003
why it came into being why i did that

3512.0 --> 3515.2
in order to clarify

3515.359 --> 3518.48
that's not what he did

3518.559 --> 3522.52
and i find that unacceptable

3533.76 --> 3538.559
and still like the entire

3536.16 --> 3540.24
like did you catch what we were talking

3538.559 --> 3541.52
about earlier and he

3540.24 --> 3543.359
dragged in

3541.52 --> 3545.839
fpv angel

3543.359 --> 3549.359
their observation

3545.839 --> 3551.68
or data on why the sun isn't holographic

3549.359 --> 3551.68
right

3552.0 --> 3556.88
you gotta realize that

3553.76 --> 3560.0
in his mind for some reason that is

3556.88 --> 3562.2400000000002
really the reason why he's now thinking

3560.0 --> 3564.72
that i'm a liar and he should have a

3562.24 --> 3567.839
more hostile

3564.72 --> 3571.04
attitude towards me

3567.839 --> 3571.04
that's insane

3571.52 --> 3576.2
like that's literally crazy

3596.48 --> 3602.48
had a global try to tell me about

3598.4 --> 3602.48
circular angles oh really

3602.72 --> 3607.839
the diagram they show three lines yeah

3605.119 --> 3607.839
straight lines

3608.16 --> 3613.96
they can still bend it in their mind

3610.079 --> 3613.96
though you know

3617.44 --> 3622.799
right just like using a sextant

3620.16 --> 3624.64
on the on the globe earth

3622.799 --> 3626.72
it can only work

3624.64 --> 3629.1189999999997
if terrestrial refraction makes

3626.72 --> 3631.359
everything optically flat

3629.119 --> 3634.319
because then you have while you're using

3631.359 --> 3637.52
it the three straight lines

3634.319 --> 3637.52
you have the right angle

3637.68 --> 3642.64
but in the geometry

3640.799 --> 3644.16
where terrestrial refraction is then

3642.64 --> 3647.04
taken away

3644.16 --> 3648.5589999999997
then suddenly that

3647.04 --> 3650.88
straight angle

3648.559 --> 3653.0400000000004
suddenly isn't straight anymore but it's

3650.88 --> 3655.119
okay because

3653.04 --> 3659.119
terrestrial refraction had made it

3655.119 --> 3661.6800000000003
straight when you were using the tool

3659.119 --> 3664.0
see how that reasons out

3661.68 --> 3666.799
it's what i was trying to share as

3664.0 --> 3668.799
ballwin as a tactic but nobody seems to

3666.799 --> 3671.04
really care anymore what ballwin does on

3668.799 --> 3673.68
the ball side

3671.04 --> 3676.079
i don't think they ever did really which

3673.68 --> 3679.1189999999997
is like really foolish because i've

3676.079 --> 3681.44
probably gave them the best

3679.119 --> 3684.079
global tips ever

3681.44 --> 3686.319
on average

3684.079 --> 3689.799
cares anyway

3686.319 --> 3689.799
it's all folly

3711.119 --> 3714.4
right so

3716.16 --> 3719.2799999999997
why did everybody go

3722.64 --> 3726.44
i'd love you to

3726.88 --> 3731.119
love to see you demonstrate that with an

3729.44 --> 3733.44
actual sexton

3731.119 --> 3733.44
what

3734.319 --> 3739.44
what do you mean

3736.72 --> 3741.5989999999997
well sexton just uses angles and

3739.44 --> 3742.559
straight lines of course

3741.599 --> 3743.44
right

3742.559 --> 3745.8390000000004
but

3743.44 --> 3748.079
look it's it's a mind trick right

3745.839 --> 3750.16
because the earth is actually flat of

3748.079 --> 3752.559
course

3750.16 --> 3754.64
so yeah it works out perfectly a sextant

3752.559 --> 3757.599
works perfectly on a flat earth it's

3754.64 --> 3760.64
very easy to use because it's all flat

3757.599 --> 3763.2000000000003
very handy right

3760.64 --> 3764.72
but with a glober

3763.2 --> 3767.2
nothing works

3764.72 --> 3770.8799999999997
right they can't even have their horizon

3767.2 --> 3772.5589999999997
be in the geometrically correct spot

3770.88 --> 3775.44
and they made up an excuse called

3772.559 --> 3777.119
terrestrial refraction that makes light

3775.44 --> 3779.599
bend

3777.119 --> 3782.96
around r

3779.599 --> 3785.52
so that it can seem to be flat because

3782.96 --> 3788.4
of that terrestrial refraction

3785.52 --> 3789.7599999999998
well you could use that same trickery of

3788.4 --> 3792.799
the mind

3789.76 --> 3794.559
to find an excuse as to why it's flat

3792.799 --> 3797.92
you know it's a sphere because it looks

3794.559 --> 3799.44
so flat right well a sextin is an

3797.92 --> 3802.7200000000003
optical instrument everything you do

3799.44 --> 3804.559
with the sextant is based on visuals

3802.72 --> 3806.9599999999996
so if you really think terrestrial

3804.559 --> 3809.44
refraction exists

3806.96 --> 3811.52
then it also applies

3809.44 --> 3813.76
to the sextant

3811.52 --> 3816.559
which means that yeah

3813.76 --> 3817.599
the earth is going to seem perfectly

3816.559 --> 3819.6800000000003
flat

3817.599 --> 3822.319
when you use the sextant because

3819.68 --> 3824.24
terrestrial refraction applies so yeah

3822.319 --> 3826.319
even though it is supposed to be a

3824.24 --> 3830.16
sphere

3826.319 --> 3834.079
you can still use the straight lines

3830.16 --> 3837.2
from the apparently flat earth

3834.079 --> 3839.52
using a sextant see

3837.2 --> 3842.5589999999997
it's really kind of a cheap ass mind

3839.52 --> 3845.2
trick but it works

3842.559 --> 3848.4
it doesn't really work but you can think

3845.2 --> 3851.0389999999998
of it as working

3848.4 --> 3852.799
i mean if you do it it'll still function

3851.039 --> 3856.119
and you can just move on and forget

3852.799 --> 3856.119
about it

3866.799 --> 3875.4
no har heart mood no that's not true

3870.4 --> 3875.4
10th man is a sextant he has many sexes

3883.2 --> 3887.0389999999998
but yeah and the other 10th man doesn't

3885.039 --> 3890.559
really want to go on camera he doesn't

3887.039 --> 3890.559
want his face recognized out

3892.839 --> 3896.64
there i don't know man maybe he kind of

3895.44 --> 3899.039
like looks like

3896.64 --> 3900.16
biden or something then that probably

3899.039 --> 3901.8390000000004
doesn't but

3900.16 --> 3904.24
can you imagine that that would be good

3901.839 --> 3908.0389999999998
enough reason not to be

3904.24 --> 3908.0389999999998
not to get on camera

3911.44 --> 3914.539
[Music]

3929.039 --> 3934.8390000000004
well randy made a video about me diddy

3932.96 --> 3938.7200000000003
ooh

3934.839 --> 3940.96
mean made a mean video

3938.72 --> 3940.9599999999996
oh

3941.2 --> 3945.7599999999998
what does he mean about

3942.96 --> 3947.68
is it is he criticizing my life

3945.76 --> 3950.48
arrangement again now

3947.68 --> 3953.2
i'm on social welfare and i'm poor and

3950.48 --> 3956.2400000000002
all must be mentally ill i don't know

3953.2 --> 3959.9199999999996
how far did he go i mean

3956.24 --> 3962.24
technically it's really really easy

3959.92 --> 3964.64
to make a pretty convincing slandering

3962.24 --> 3966.5589999999997
piece about me if anybody wanted to

3964.64 --> 3970.16
right you can't do that

3966.559 --> 3970.1600000000003
it's just that if you do

3970.48 --> 3974.2400000000002
my yeah my spirit on the other side is

3972.799 --> 3976.48
going to take notice and then it's going

3974.24 --> 3977.2799999999997
to curse you to hell

3976.48 --> 3979.599
right

3977.28 --> 3982.1600000000003
i cannot be held responsible for

3979.599 --> 3983.599
anything that happens because of your

3982.16 --> 3985.52
hit piece on me

3983.599 --> 3988.2400000000002
except that i'm not going to do anything

3985.52 --> 3990.839
here in the physical world right

3988.24 --> 3994.3999999999996
but yeah you really want to risk

3990.839 --> 3996.96
it you really want to risk

3994.4 --> 3996.96
doing that

3997.2 --> 4001.8799999999997
because freaky things might happen

4006.079 --> 4012.3590000000004
right it's never good to lie

4009.039 --> 4012.3590000000004
about me

4020.0 --> 4024.96
right but hey

4021.76 --> 4026.4
i'm welcoming any honest attempts at

4024.96 --> 4028.96
analysis

4026.4 --> 4032.48
i'm trying to analyze myself all the

4028.96 --> 4032.48
time i mean i'm pretty much a

4032.839 --> 4039.44
public

4034.799 --> 4039.44
psychological sociological project here

4039.599 --> 4045.2000000000003
like i am my own study object that i am

4042.48 --> 4047.839
studying publicly

4045.2 --> 4049.9199999999996
right so yeah people can of course

4047.839 --> 4053.119
attempt to

4049.92 --> 4054.96
to make sense of me in some way

4053.119 --> 4057.039
and if you want to make me look bad yeah

4054.96 --> 4060.4
well i got enough material to make me

4057.039 --> 4062.4
look pretty damn bad and crazy

4060.4 --> 4064.48
and dark and whatever you want if you

4062.4 --> 4067.119
just edit it all together like that you

4064.48 --> 4069.2
know you can very much do that and yeah

4067.119 --> 4071.2000000000003
it'll look pretty [ __ ] up

4069.2 --> 4073.5989999999997
that's right

4071.2 --> 4075.4399999999996
well what's the price though on the

4073.599 --> 4078.079
other side

4075.44 --> 4081.599
when you actually do that

4078.079 --> 4084.7200000000003
you want to have that in your memory

4081.599 --> 4086.48
having made that video about me

4084.72 --> 4090.2
huh

4086.48 --> 4090.2
you think that's safe

4097.759 --> 4101.839
show us my camera again oh was he just

4100.319 --> 4103.04
whining about

4101.839 --> 4107.759
about oh

4103.04 --> 4110.319
i'm not using a p900 he stole it from us

4107.759 --> 4114.6
he starts that's from us

4110.319 --> 4114.6
miles p 900.

4119.679 --> 4123.1990000000005
sure i'll show it why not

4129.839 --> 4135.5199999999995
that's super

4131.12 --> 4137.04
precious you're not taking it for me

4135.52 --> 4140.319
mine

4137.04 --> 4144.2789999999995
my brush is my mind

4140.319 --> 4144.279
it keeps it safe

4160.319 --> 4164.2390000000005
oh he made a video of me hitting myself

4162.56 --> 4166.080000000001
yeah of course i knew that was gonna

4164.239 --> 4168.4
happen it's like

4166.08 --> 4172.0
every time i do something like that it's

4168.4 --> 4175.12
like instant porno for anti-flat earth

4172.0 --> 4176.799
there's instant porno i know it's like i

4175.12 --> 4179.199
knew that was gonna happen i knew like

4176.799 --> 4181.44
oh man there's gonna be at least like

4179.199 --> 4185.04
10 people

4181.44 --> 4187.12
saving that clip and then using it

4185.04 --> 4189.44
for later references and maybe even

4187.12 --> 4191.679
they'll have like a quick meme hit by

4189.44 --> 4192.48
arwen hitting himself button

4191.679 --> 4194.4800000000005
right

4192.48 --> 4198.04
i knew that was gonna happen but yeah

4194.48 --> 4198.04
i'm very generous

4213.44 --> 4219.5199999999995
he was comparing me to gollum okay well

4216.4 --> 4221.28
that's fine i i i do a very good gollum

4219.52 --> 4222.400000000001
impression so

4221.28 --> 4226.28
yeah

4222.4 --> 4226.28
he can do that if he likes

4235.64 --> 4238.759
[Music]

4246.4 --> 4251.92
i guess i gave him some more sound bites

4248.4 --> 4254.92
oh yes i did absolutely

4251.92 --> 4254.92
right

4268.8 --> 4271.8
hmm

4276.56 --> 4282.88
yeah adam price that's a tricky thing to

4279.84 --> 4286.08
say right globies are often flatties

4282.88 --> 4289.36
with ties and responsibilities to liars

4286.08 --> 4291.6
well that then they're not flatties

4289.36 --> 4291.599999999999
right

4292.159 --> 4296.5599999999995
not really because as soon as you do

4295.12 --> 4297.28
that

4296.56 --> 4299.04
you

4297.28 --> 4303.04
convolute things

4299.04 --> 4305.36
and then you lose it you lose

4303.04 --> 4309.199
what the real power of being a flat

4305.36 --> 4311.839999999999
earther is which is that you don't

4309.199 --> 4313.599999999999
that you sever the ties with the liars

4311.84 --> 4316.64
and darkness

4313.6 --> 4319.52
that's the entire point of it right

4316.64 --> 4321.52
i mean a flat earther that never comes

4319.52 --> 4323.76
out about

4321.52 --> 4327.679
their knowledge that never discusses it

4323.76 --> 4329.679
that never gets into trouble over it

4327.679 --> 4332.08
right that never confronts something

4329.679 --> 4334.08
that needs to be confronted that's not a

4332.08 --> 4335.92
flat earther

4334.08 --> 4338.8
right if that were the case then you

4335.92 --> 4340.88
could call everybody a flat earther well

4338.8 --> 4342.88
they're not

4340.88 --> 4345.1990000000005
i mean they live on a flat earth but

4342.88 --> 4347.6
they're not flat earthers because it's

4345.199 --> 4349.678999999999
it's actually the confrontation and the

4347.6 --> 4351.76
dealing with it

4349.679 --> 4354.08
including socially that really makes you

4351.76 --> 4354.08
one

4355.679 --> 4359.76
right so it's

4356.88 --> 4362.4800000000005
if you call it a closeted flat earther

4359.76 --> 4362.4800000000005
yeah sure

4366.32 --> 4370.639999999999
are we gonna get medieval and written no

4368.4 --> 4372.719
no no dude

4370.64 --> 4377.280000000001
no i'm not gonna do anything to rent

4372.719 --> 4378.96
dude what that guy's done to himself

4377.28 --> 4382.08
in the spirit realm

4378.96 --> 4385.36
dude i literally i mentioned this many

4382.08 --> 4387.44
times i tried to warn him don't do this

4385.36 --> 4390.48
don't go there

4387.44 --> 4392.799999999999
and he's already paid the price

4390.48 --> 4392.799999999999
right

4393.6 --> 4401.84
i mean this is like a guy

4397.12 --> 4403.599999999999
hanging by a very old and weathered rope

4401.84 --> 4405.76
over a cliff

4403.6 --> 4407.4400000000005
right and i'm standing there at the top

4405.76 --> 4411.360000000001
of the cliff

4407.44 --> 4411.36
and he's like making fun of me

4411.44 --> 4417.678999999999
while he's hanging on those ropes almost

4415.28 --> 4419.84
falling apart on that cliff he's making

4417.679 --> 4424.12
fun of no no

4419.84 --> 4424.12
i don't have to do anything

4427.28 --> 4434.0
now he he already did all that damage

4429.52 --> 4434.0
right right down to himself so

4435.199 --> 4438.0
and besides see there's nothing he can

4437.12 --> 4441.76
do

4438.0 --> 4443.84
literally there's nothing he can do

4441.76 --> 4446.8
like all he has

4443.84 --> 4448.400000000001
all anybody has out there is what i've

4446.8 --> 4450.719
given them right

4448.4 --> 4452.719
and i've dug up and been honest about

4450.719 --> 4455.76
way more things

4452.719 --> 4457.76
than anybody could have ever dug up

4455.76 --> 4458.88
about me

4457.76 --> 4462.96
see

4458.88 --> 4468.96
they can't do anything

4462.96 --> 4470.32
my honesty is my invincible armor

4468.96 --> 4472.159
the greatest

4470.32 --> 4476.48
weakness

4472.159 --> 4476.48
was actually my greatest strength

4479.44 --> 4483.839999999999
you see

4481.52 --> 4486.64
so this is all just folly it can't

4483.84 --> 4489.360000000001
really do anything no it's people that

4486.64 --> 4491.12
i've trusted

4489.36 --> 4493.28
that i thought

4491.12 --> 4494.96
were close to me

4493.28 --> 4497.599999999999
right

4494.96 --> 4500.4800000000005
when they betray that that's the thing

4497.6 --> 4503.4400000000005
that hurts me that's what's gonna

4500.48 --> 4503.44
yield vengeance

4506.88 --> 4512.32
and yeah annoying gamma trolls that are

4510.239 --> 4514.799999999999
anonymous and make sock accounts and

4512.32 --> 4518.28
[ __ ] that that pisses me off

4514.8 --> 4518.28
because of the cowardice

4530.719 --> 4534.0
all right but anyway

4533.04 --> 4536.159
yeah

4534.0 --> 4538.08
people only make dumb videos about me

4536.159 --> 4540.159
when they try to attack me they i've

4538.08 --> 4541.84
never ever had actually actually

4540.159 --> 4544.159
anything

4541.84 --> 4546.96
that actually made a case it's

4544.159 --> 4549.599999999999
every time like sean or

4546.96 --> 4551.84
this case ranty or whoever makes some

4549.6 --> 4552.88
stupid video about me it's always just

4551.84 --> 4555.28
like

4552.88 --> 4556.719
orwen's so stupid oh look at how stupid

4555.28 --> 4559.36
he is and that's it

4556.719 --> 4562.4
they don't have anything

4559.36 --> 4564.839999999999
they can't actually draw in anything

4562.4 --> 4567.28
i've ever said that was serious about

4564.84 --> 4570.0
anything or enlightening because then

4567.28 --> 4571.92
immediately whatever they try to achieve

4570.0 --> 4574.159
to make me look just dumb

4571.92 --> 4576.8
it immediately breaks apart

4574.159 --> 4576.799999999999
immediately

4577.44 --> 4581.919999999999
right

4578.48 --> 4584.5599999999995
because i can be silly i can be

4581.92 --> 4587.52
silly and goofy

4584.56 --> 4591.120000000001
because all the rest i do

4587.52 --> 4592.4800000000005
is very deadly serious and very focused

4591.12 --> 4596.4
in ways and

4592.48 --> 4598.799999999999
long-term crack fractal thinking

4596.4 --> 4601.04
right i have a balance here oh i'm gonna

4598.8 --> 4602.719
admit paper boy

4601.04 --> 4604.88
paper boi is so good yeah i'm not a

4602.719 --> 4607.92
paper boy anymore though

4604.88 --> 4609.1990000000005
right that job dissolved in may last

4607.92 --> 4613.6
year

4609.199 --> 4613.599999999999
so yeah the paperboy jokes have run out

4620.64 --> 4625.52
was it good no no it was kind of lame

4628.56 --> 4634.159000000001
it's it's kind of ridiculous in this age

4631.12 --> 4637.84
anyhow to shame anybody

4634.159 --> 4637.839999999999
for having any sort of job

4638.08 --> 4641.679
like seriously you're gonna shame

4639.92 --> 4643.92
anybody like

4641.679 --> 4647.12
just think about it i was being shamed

4643.92 --> 4649.84
for being a paper boy

4647.12 --> 4651.84
now i'm supposedly shamed for not having

4649.84 --> 4654.08
a job even though i do have a job it's

4651.84 --> 4656.0
youtubing i actually have an income it's

4654.08 --> 4659.12
officially registered

4656.0 --> 4662.0
right it's not much but it is a job

4659.12 --> 4664.64
but before oh it's paperboy oh oh now i

4662.0 --> 4667.199
don't have a job so

4664.64 --> 4669.52
is it bad to be a paper boy or is it bad

4667.199 --> 4672.5599999999995
to not have a job it doesn't seem to

4669.52 --> 4674.56
really matter what i do or how i make my

4672.56 --> 4676.84
money or not make my money it seems to

4674.56 --> 4680.0
be wrong no matter where i am

4676.84 --> 4682.400000000001
at really

4680.0 --> 4685.04
so it doesn't really matter

4682.4 --> 4685.04
any of it

4688.08 --> 4694.239
right oh baby boy oh not not paper boi

4692.0 --> 4696.8
oh look at this not paper boy oh he

4694.239 --> 4698.879999999999
doesn't even have a paper boy job oh

4696.8 --> 4700.88
oh look he has a paper boy job oh my god

4698.88 --> 4703.4400000000005
that's so embarrassing he's just a paper

4700.88 --> 4705.6
boy oh look oh no he he doesn't have a

4703.44 --> 4709.599999999999
paper boy jumping oh my god look at that

4705.6 --> 4710.719
not paper boi that's so embarrassing

4709.6 --> 4713.52
oh

4710.719 --> 4716.32
he's not even a paper boy oh

4713.52 --> 4719.84
just what's the point

4716.32 --> 4722.159
it's all just pissing it's all just

4719.84 --> 4724.2390000000005
pissing down and like what do you even

4722.159 --> 4726.08
do

4724.239 --> 4729.36
what do you do in your life that you're

4726.08 --> 4729.36
so damn proud of

4732.239 --> 4736.48
to do that

4733.76 --> 4739.04
to start whining about that

4736.48 --> 4742.08
i mean it can't be all that good

4739.04 --> 4744.88
if you literally spend the time trying

4742.08 --> 4748.4
to shame somebody for their

4744.88 --> 4750.88
job or not having their job right it

4748.4 --> 4753.28
just seems like well

4750.88 --> 4754.8
if your job would have been that great

4753.28 --> 4756.08
you wouldn't have

4754.8 --> 4758.719
been

4756.08 --> 4760.4
feeling the need to just shame somebody

4758.719 --> 4763.28
over their

4760.4 --> 4766.239
work life you know

4763.28 --> 4768.639999999999
so maybe people that do that are really

4766.239 --> 4772.4
just super unhappy

4768.64 --> 4772.400000000001
with their shitty job

4772.8 --> 4777.360000000001
that's what i think

4775.04 --> 4780.4
right because i'm not unhappy

4777.36 --> 4782.4
with the jobs i i've done right i

4780.4 --> 4784.08
actually like being a paper boy i kind

4782.4 --> 4786.48
of miss it

4784.08 --> 4786.48
because

4786.8 --> 4792.4800000000005
it got me out there it it got me facing

4789.92 --> 4794.56
people i felt like i had some kind of a

4792.48 --> 4797.839999999999
duty to spread the newspapers and to

4794.56 --> 4800.64
make sure it's not just all wasted

4797.84 --> 4802.719
doesn't all just end up in a paper bin

4800.64 --> 4804.96
right and to inform people like hey yeah

4802.719 --> 4806.96
i have a lot of newspaper leftovers i

4804.96 --> 4808.4800000000005
leave them over here you can always get

4806.96 --> 4810.4
it there

4808.48 --> 4811.919999999999
now i can't do that anymore it's really

4810.4 --> 4813.599999999999
sad i had this thing going where

4811.92 --> 4815.6
everybody just knew there's always that

4813.6 --> 4819.6
paper over there for free you can always

4815.6 --> 4821.360000000001
just get it walk in get it i like that

4819.6 --> 4823.6
made me feel good

4821.36 --> 4827.12
make me feel like i even though it's

4823.6 --> 4828.96
small i was doing something good

4827.12 --> 4831.44
you know

4828.96 --> 4834.0
so those people that try to shame me

4831.44 --> 4835.04
over being a paper boy or

4834.0 --> 4837.28
not

4835.04 --> 4839.84
having a job

4837.28 --> 4841.759999999999
do they have the same sensations about

4839.84 --> 4843.679
their job

4841.76 --> 4845.6
does it bring them meaning do they feel

4843.679 --> 4848.2390000000005
better about what they've done

4845.6 --> 4848.2390000000005
afterward

4848.719 --> 4851.36
i wonder

4870.96 --> 4874.76
a creative video

4875.92 --> 4880.6
okay rufus

4877.6 --> 4880.6
fine

4903.92 --> 4907.679
trolls are creepy yeah

4909.84 --> 4913.92
yeah although

4911.44 --> 4916.799999999999
bob and charles

4913.92 --> 4918.0
they're not really trolls they're just

4916.8 --> 4922.320000000001
really

4918.0 --> 4924.4
deep into the doodoo type of wizards

4922.32 --> 4926.799999999999
they're like in over their heads they've

4924.4 --> 4930.638999999999
signed on to it and they're going

4926.8 --> 4934.400000000001
to the end but that's like really shitty

4930.639 --> 4934.400000000001
that was a really bad choice

4934.96 --> 4938.2390000000005
because now they're just they will just

4937.36 --> 4940.239
be

4938.239 --> 4943.599999999999
facing a point where they're just gonna

4940.239 --> 4946.0
have to like lie quickly to move on and

4943.6 --> 4948.320000000001
hope nobody catches on and then it's

4946.0 --> 4950.639
just gonna be that all the time just

4948.32 --> 4952.719
constantly like i have to lie again

4950.639 --> 4954.88
because i can't handle this oh let's

4952.719 --> 4956.88
hope they don't catch on and that's like

4954.88 --> 4959.04
all they have left then at some point

4956.88 --> 4961.6
it's

4959.04 --> 4964.159
it's very similar to where some

4961.6 --> 4967.4400000000005
politicians are at

4964.159 --> 4967.44
with their social conduct

4967.6 --> 4972.159000000001
they're just like

4969.12 --> 4974.0
so buried under

4972.159 --> 4976.32
under the contracts they made for

4974.0 --> 4979.36
themselves that they have no more choice

4976.32 --> 4982.239
left but to just lie constantly about

4979.36 --> 4986.159
everything and hope nobody

4982.239 --> 4989.44
picks up on it as they make the lie

4986.159 --> 4992.239
and that's what yeah people like

4989.44 --> 4992.239
flat earth math

4992.32 --> 4997.04
and bob

4994.639 --> 5000.6
science guys but yeah that's that's what

4997.04 --> 5000.6
they're like too

5003.87 --> 5009.76
[Music]

5006.719 --> 5014.44
they have very little left

5009.76 --> 5014.4400000000005
very very little maneuvering room left

5015.6 --> 5019.2390000000005
but they're still going

5040.719 --> 5046.719
oh oh oh by the way i gotta share

5043.6 --> 5046.719
something special

5047.679 --> 5051.4
i gotta do it

5058.239 --> 5063.199
the mitchell from australia had a

5059.84 --> 5063.1990000000005
communication apparently

5065.679 --> 5071.84
with bob nodell

5067.679 --> 5071.84
and and you've got to see this it's

5084.719 --> 5090.84
i don't know if this is big enough so

5086.96 --> 5090.84
that you can read it

5110.84 --> 5115.12
uh right let me size it up

5115.92 --> 5119.28
so you can't read it

5120.239 --> 5123.12
right there you

5124.84 --> 5130.56
go seriously

5127.12 --> 5130.5599999999995
let me try to read this out

5132.239 --> 5137.12
mitchell's from australia wondering

5134.56 --> 5139.76
where the constant downward force

5137.12 --> 5142.239
is when watching my helium balloon go up

5139.76 --> 5144.320000000001
right very typical

5142.239 --> 5145.04
just check this out

5144.32 --> 5147.92
the

5145.04 --> 5150.719
globe busters this is bob the force is

5147.92 --> 5153.6
still being exerted downwards but it is

5150.719 --> 5155.199
being overwritten by the buoyant force

5153.6 --> 5158.0
resulting

5155.199 --> 5160.0
resultant from the density differential

5158.0 --> 5162.0
between the helium inside and outside

5160.0 --> 5163.76
balloon outside yeah yeah that's that's

5162.0 --> 5165.84
that's decent enough

5163.76 --> 5167.6
if the balloon were inside the vacuum

5165.84 --> 5170.639
chamber it would not rise because the

5167.6 --> 5173.280000000001
helium or even hydrogen heavier than the

5170.639 --> 5176.159000000001
evacuated area yeah that's only because

5173.28 --> 5178.159
it's contained by a balloon

5176.159 --> 5180.159
but here it goes

5178.159 --> 5183.759999999999
you could even let

5180.159 --> 5185.04
helium or hydrogen loose inside a vacuum

5183.76 --> 5188.320000000001
chamber

5185.04 --> 5190.96
but after it's get it gets done bouncing

5188.32 --> 5192.239
around inside the chamber it too will

5190.96 --> 5194.56
settle

5192.239 --> 5196.638999999999
at the bottom

5194.56 --> 5199.76
because both helium hydrogen have a

5196.639 --> 5202.56
higher charge potential

5199.76 --> 5204.96
than the non-charged vacuous area in the

5202.56 --> 5207.120000000001
chamber

5204.96 --> 5210.0
since none of you have any scientific

5207.12 --> 5212.159
training whatsoever you believe nathan's

5210.0 --> 5215.28
misinterpretation

5212.159 --> 5217.92
of this so-called ideal gas law

5215.28 --> 5219.759999999999
which is admittedly the reason

5217.92 --> 5224.56
it is called ideal blood that's a total

5219.76 --> 5226.639
straw man of course yeah but see yeah

5224.56 --> 5230.56
you could even let

5226.639 --> 5233.4400000000005
helium or hydrogen lose inside a vacuum

5230.56 --> 5235.6
chamber but after it gets done bouncing

5233.44 --> 5239.839999999999
around inside the chamber it too will

5235.6 --> 5239.84
settle at the bottom

5241.679 --> 5246.88
bob dardell believes in helium puddles

5244.56 --> 5246.88
guys

5247.679 --> 5253.6
you heard it first on the flat earth

5250.08 --> 5255.92
early bird show

5253.6 --> 5257.280000000001
this is

5255.92 --> 5259.52
just

5257.28 --> 5259.5199999999995
wow

5262.48 --> 5266.199
isn't that just special

5278.56 --> 5281.56
is

5283.75 --> 5286.81
[Music]

5300.0 --> 5304.159
that that was pretty damn funny come on

5304.239 --> 5307.678999999999
and like seriously bob

5306.719 --> 5309.84
really

5307.679 --> 5311.12
you're gonna go there it's like

5309.84 --> 5314.159000000001
is he

5311.12 --> 5317.04
trying his best

5314.159 --> 5318.799999999999
to defend like all the anti-flat earth

5317.04 --> 5320.719
nonsense arguments

5318.8 --> 5325.8
because

5320.719 --> 5325.8
it seems like he is trying to do that

5351.36 --> 5357.28
truly the gift that keeps on giving is

5354.96 --> 5357.28
right

5357.36 --> 5363.239
it is freaking hilarious i'll give you

5360.239 --> 5363.239
that

5377.84 --> 5379.92
i

5394.639 --> 5398.2390000000005
jelly of the month's boss

5403.04 --> 5406.719
what would actually happen if you let it

5405.12 --> 5409.199
loose it's going to spread out in all

5406.719 --> 5411.76
directions and unless you have some kind

5409.199 --> 5413.599999999999
of heat or cold

5411.76 --> 5415.76
introduction

5413.6 --> 5417.92
effectively it's not going to radiate

5415.76 --> 5420.2390000000005
it's just going to spread out evenly in

5417.92 --> 5422.8
the entire chamber

5420.239 --> 5424.718999999999
of course unless it's an ongoing vacuum

5422.8 --> 5426.320000000001
chamber and gas is constantly being

5424.719 --> 5428.32
pulled out and then it's just gonna all

5426.32 --> 5429.92
be sucked out

5428.32 --> 5430.799999999999
right it's not gonna settle on the

5429.92 --> 5434.92
bottom

5430.8 --> 5434.92
gases don't settle

5435.04 --> 5439.6
get it

5435.92 --> 5442.159
that's the difference gases don't settle

5439.6 --> 5446.639
they spread out

5442.159 --> 5446.638999999999
until everything is evenly distributed

5447.52 --> 5452.159000000001
it doesn't settle gases don't settle

5449.76 --> 5456.320000000001
everything else settles though right

5452.159 --> 5456.32
liquids settle solids settle

5456.96 --> 5463.12
gases they don't settle right it

5460.239 --> 5464.879999999999
you have to combine it with a solid like

5463.12 --> 5467.04
a balloon

5464.88 --> 5467.92
and then it may

5467.04 --> 5470.0
well

5467.92 --> 5471.679
you could call that settle it's going to

5470.0 --> 5473.36
just sit somewhere

5471.679 --> 5476.4800000000005
because it's

5473.36 --> 5480.5599999999995
yeah its density is with the rubber

5476.48 --> 5480.5599999999995
included is higher than the medium

5482.48 --> 5486.959999999999
right in a vacuum

5484.32 --> 5488.96
in vacuum chamber but

5486.96 --> 5491.28
without that solid

5488.96 --> 5494.88
keeping it in its place it's literally

5491.28 --> 5494.88
just gonna spread out evenly

5495.04 --> 5498.639
and

5496.239 --> 5500.799999999999
just nothing's gonna change the evenness

5498.639 --> 5502.84
of it having spread out

5500.8 --> 5504.8
except if there is a temperature

5502.84 --> 5506.08
insertion

5504.8 --> 5508.159000000001
there is

5506.08 --> 5510.5599999999995
heat being introduced on one side of the

5508.159 --> 5514.239
container and cold on the other

5510.56 --> 5516.639
then gradation might happen

5514.239 --> 5520.08
but without it nothing it's just going

5516.639 --> 5520.08
to be evenly spread out

5522.88 --> 5528.2390000000005
on the format comet the helium balloon

5525.199 --> 5528.239
doesn't rise yet

5531.199 --> 5535.678999999999
right now that's because the whole thing

5534.0 --> 5539.04
is falling

5535.679 --> 5539.04
it's all being displaced

5543.76 --> 5550.2390000000005
right so if the whole thing is

5547.12 --> 5551.84
pushing the gas which is in the vomit

5550.239 --> 5553.28
comet

5551.84 --> 5554.8
upward

5553.28 --> 5557.5199999999995
because the whole thing is moving

5554.8 --> 5558.719
downward in a parabolic arc

5557.52 --> 5561.280000000001
right

5558.719 --> 5562.96
the gases are going to push

5561.28 --> 5564.5599999999995
upward

5562.96 --> 5566.2390000000005
through force

5564.56 --> 5568.96
which is going to make the helium

5566.239 --> 5571.599999999999
balloon being less dense

5568.96 --> 5573.36
less inclined to be pushed upward in

5571.6 --> 5575.92
relating to the gas that surrounds it

5573.36 --> 5578.0
because it the gas surrounding it is

5575.92 --> 5579.12
already pushing upward so it's actually

5578.0 --> 5583.199
gonna

5579.12 --> 5585.679
then not necessarily go upward

5583.199 --> 5588.48
right it's it it's complicated though

5585.679 --> 5590.4800000000005
the whole dynamics of like vomit comet

5588.48 --> 5593.12
what happens in it's complicated it's

5590.48 --> 5595.28
not as super straightforward

5593.12 --> 5598.159
as with the regular density tower that's

5595.28 --> 5600.32
stationary it's all in motion relative

5598.159 --> 5603.32
density becomes complicated it's just a

5600.32 --> 5603.32
fact

5603.84 --> 5606.719
right

5605.04 --> 5610.0
and you don't even have to go into a

5606.719 --> 5612.08
vomit comet to to show that effect that

5610.0 --> 5614.96
i tried to describe

5612.08 --> 5616.8
you can put a helium balloon on a string

5614.96 --> 5619.84
inside of a car

5616.8 --> 5621.28
the car with the not an open roof car

5619.84 --> 5624.32
right

5621.28 --> 5627.04
that's closed off if you

5624.32 --> 5628.84
start pedaling the metal

5627.04 --> 5631.6
the balloon is

5628.84 --> 5632.719
gonna thrust forward

5631.6 --> 5635.120000000001
why

5632.719 --> 5638.0
because the acceleration of the entire

5635.12 --> 5640.48
medium is causing the gas on the inside

5638.0 --> 5643.04
to be pushed backwards because of the

5640.48 --> 5644.799999999999
acceleration which is going to make the

5643.04 --> 5645.92
helium balloon which is less dense than

5644.8 --> 5648.0
the medium

5645.92 --> 5651.28
actually move the opposite

5648.0 --> 5654.239
to the less dense

5651.28 --> 5656.32
right and yeah the same effect works in

5654.239 --> 5659.839999999999
the vomit comet this is a lot easier to

5656.32 --> 5659.84
demonstrate just in your car

5663.679 --> 5667.52
buoyancy goes away in free fall

5668.8 --> 5674.4800000000005
well that depends on if

5672.239 --> 5677.678999999999
what type of freefall it is right free

5674.48 --> 5680.48
fall in open air keeps the air friction

5677.679 --> 5683.28
that makes everything work differently

5680.48 --> 5684.718999999999
but if it's if the entire medium is

5683.28 --> 5686.639
closed off

5684.719 --> 5689.119
from the open air

5686.639 --> 5691.679
then yes buoyancy will effectively be

5689.119 --> 5694.96
negated

5691.679 --> 5694.96
the effect of buoyancy

5696.56 --> 5702.320000000001
which is effectively relative density

5699.119 --> 5706.199
disequilibrium displacement because of

5702.32 --> 5706.199
yeah density differential

5714.59 --> 5717.709
[Music]

5721.8 --> 5725.9490000000005
[Music]

5730.32 --> 5735.5199999999995
the actual no it shows not the actual

5733.199 --> 5738.08
acceleration it's just acceleration

5735.52 --> 5740.639
acceleration causes a force

5738.08 --> 5742.96
probably a force to be subjected on the

5740.639 --> 5744.88
whole thing and that's going to

5742.96 --> 5747.36
rearrange it right

5744.88 --> 5749.119
there is no force of gravity though

5747.36 --> 5752.0
that's not a force it's not claimed to

5749.119 --> 5754.719
be a force it is in the force

5752.0 --> 5758.159
and you can't vary and manipulate it in

5754.719 --> 5760.8
order to prove it is a thing even

5758.159 --> 5764.159
right it's just relative density

5760.8 --> 5766.159000000001
relative density is the natural

5764.159 --> 5770.04
state

5766.159 --> 5770.04
of matter in the realm

5770.96 --> 5776.4
there's no force you can think of it as

5773.36 --> 5778.719
a force you can calculate it in like as

5776.4 --> 5780.719
if there is a force being subjected to

5778.719 --> 5781.84
everything causing the relative density

5780.719 --> 5783.92
division

5781.84 --> 5786.400000000001
but you have no evidence of that you

5783.92 --> 5789.28
could never prove that because you can't

5786.4 --> 5790.879999999999
vary and manipulate the gravity

5789.28 --> 5792.719
without

5790.88 --> 5793.679
action no you can't you can just can't

5792.719 --> 5795.84
do it

5793.679 --> 5800.0
you can only simulate

5795.84 --> 5802.88
adding on motion adding on forces

5800.0 --> 5806.0
and then presupposing that the natural

5802.88 --> 5809.119
passive state is that force too that's

5806.0 --> 5811.679
all you can ever do you understand you

5809.119 --> 5815.28
can't very manipulate gravity it's not a

5811.679 --> 5815.28
thing you can very manipulate

5815.44 --> 5822.5599999999995
you can only introduce other forces to

5819.44 --> 5824.48
then suggest that it is a force too

5822.56 --> 5826.639
that's all you can ever do that's the

5824.48 --> 5828.48
trap that i fell in all those years ago

5826.639 --> 5829.92
when i thought that gravity was still

5828.48 --> 5831.678999999999
real

5829.92 --> 5835.159
right

5831.679 --> 5835.159
it isn't though

5846.159 --> 5852.4
what makes this axis special for

5849.44 --> 5852.4
relative density

5852.84 --> 5860.32
special what do you mean special

5857.119 --> 5861.759999999999
that's just the way it works

5860.32 --> 5864.32
that's the way

5861.76 --> 5867.6
the yeah the relative density this

5864.32 --> 5869.599999999999
equilibrium force is arranged naturally

5867.6 --> 5873.52
in a passive state

5869.6 --> 5875.84
and you can alter that apparent axis by

5873.52 --> 5876.719
introducing other forces

5875.84 --> 5880.84
right

5876.719 --> 5883.679
but that doesn't mean that the axis is a

5880.84 --> 5885.76
force that it is a universal force

5883.679 --> 5888.32
pushing it or pulling in one direction

5885.76 --> 5890.88
that's not what's going on

5888.32 --> 5893.84
because you can't very manipulate

5890.88 --> 5896.400000000001
it other than introducing other forces

5893.84 --> 5900.56
to off-balance it in order to prove that

5896.4 --> 5900.5599999999995
it is even caused by a force

5900.8 --> 5907.88
it's just relative density it's just the

5902.639 --> 5907.88
natural state of matter within the realm

5910.4 --> 5913.44
how it's arranged

5921.28 --> 5924.5599999999995
okay you did not ask about force well

5922.96 --> 5926.08
then i don't understand your question

5924.56 --> 5929.76
harmon

5926.08 --> 5929.76
i don't know why you bring it up then

5936.56 --> 5940.4800000000005
be careful if you get one thing wrong

5938.4 --> 5941.839999999999
the earth becomes a water bowl nah not

5940.48 --> 5943.28
really

5941.84 --> 5946.400000000001
if i get one thing wrong i'll just

5943.28 --> 5946.4
immediately correct it

5947.92 --> 5952.4
yeah that's the way it works no further

5949.76 --> 5954.4800000000005
questions then yeah that's right

5952.4 --> 5958.0
that is right

5954.48 --> 5960.5599999999995
yeah because you can blabber on all day

5958.0 --> 5962.159
with your further questions it's not

5960.56 --> 5965.679
going to achieve anything there is

5962.159 --> 5966.4
nothing you can achieve beyond it

5965.679 --> 5969.1990000000005
right

5966.4 --> 5972.32
the apparent axis relative density this

5969.199 --> 5974.879999999999
equilibrium force is arranged the way it

5972.32 --> 5979.44
does in a passive state

5974.88 --> 5981.119
and we don't know why we will never ever

5979.44 --> 5984.0
find out why

5981.119 --> 5986.5599999999995
i know this i know we will never find

5984.0 --> 5986.56
out why

5989.679 --> 5995.52
right it's just the way it is

5992.88 --> 5998.2390000000005
there's nothing you can do about it

5995.52 --> 6000.320000000001
it's just the way it is

5998.239 --> 6002.08
it's nothing you could reason out you

6000.32 --> 6005.04
could test

6002.08 --> 6006.639
in order to prove a cause to it you

6005.04 --> 6009.84
can't

6006.639 --> 6009.84
that's a fact

6031.6 --> 6034.6
um

6053.92 --> 6058.56
i will never find out why now nobody

6056.159 --> 6062.239
does and neither will you but you can

6058.56 --> 6064.88
build giant delusions for yourself

6062.239 --> 6067.36
spend half your life trying to convince

6064.88 --> 6069.92
yourself and everybody else that you

6067.36 --> 6071.04
have found the answer even though it

6069.92 --> 6074.0
will be

6071.04 --> 6076.0
guaranteed pseudoscience

6074.0 --> 6078.56
there's nothing you can do

6076.0 --> 6080.88
you can't very manipulate you can't vary

6078.56 --> 6082.96
and manipulate

6080.88 --> 6085.04
the axis of relative density these

6082.96 --> 6088.32
equilibrium forces you can't very

6085.04 --> 6092.88
manipulate it you can only add on other

6088.32 --> 6095.599999999999
forces subject a medium to other forces

6092.88 --> 6097.84
in order to suggest that it's caused by

6095.6 --> 6100.8
a force

6097.84 --> 6103.6
that's literally the only thing you can

6100.8 --> 6105.1990000000005
ever do to do anything with it in the

6103.6 --> 6107.679
first place

6105.199 --> 6109.599999999999
there's nothing else there is no other

6107.679 --> 6111.119
data you don't don't you get it there is

6109.6 --> 6113.92
no other data

6111.119 --> 6117.4
you can't attain other data about it

6113.92 --> 6117.4
this is it

6124.96 --> 6127.96
so

6137.28 --> 6142.4
really

6139.36 --> 6145.599999999999
my knowledge about map projections yeah

6142.4 --> 6148.159
but my knowledge is not that extensive

6145.6 --> 6150.88
i just know it works like this i know

6148.159 --> 6152.4
that if i keep repeating that a thousand

6150.88 --> 6154.56
times

6152.4 --> 6155.5199999999995
over the next year

6154.56 --> 6158.2390000000005
that

6155.52 --> 6160.8
yeah yeah in the future

6158.239 --> 6162.5599999999995
i will turn out to be right i know i

6160.8 --> 6167.4400000000005
will

6162.56 --> 6171.04
yeah i know i know i will i have

6167.44 --> 6173.28
i have many times had that for knowledge

6171.04 --> 6175.5199999999995
about saying things that everybody at

6173.28 --> 6178.0
the time thinks is ridiculous

6175.52 --> 6180.159000000001
and then knowing

6178.0 --> 6183.28
knowing

6180.159 --> 6184.879999999999
that in the future i will turn out to be

6183.28 --> 6189.4
right

6184.88 --> 6189.400000000001
and i know it now as well

6192.96 --> 6197.52
so just

6195.28 --> 6201.239
sit back

6197.52 --> 6201.2390000000005
and find out

6205.52 --> 6212.080000000001
i'm not here to convince people

6209.36 --> 6215.5199999999995
professional people that have a job and

6212.08 --> 6216.96
do things based on a certain religious

6215.52 --> 6219.679
framework

6216.96 --> 6222.32
i'm not there to disrupt them i'm not

6219.679 --> 6224.4800000000005
there to try to break open their lives

6222.32 --> 6225.92
and force them to reconstruct the way

6224.48 --> 6227.119
they look at things

6225.92 --> 6229.119
yeah

6227.119 --> 6231.679
that's their own damn business if they

6229.119 --> 6233.36
want to be delusional and spread globe

6231.679 --> 6235.04
nonsense the rest of their life that's

6233.36 --> 6238.32
fine go do it

6235.04 --> 6240.8
i'm just here to try to figure out

6238.32 --> 6244.28
and then keep straight

6240.8 --> 6244.28
what is real

6250.239 --> 6253.5199999999995
hey stalin 8012

6253.6 --> 6257.360000000001
having a good day yeah yeah pretty much

6255.44 --> 6261.5599999999995
it's my birthday today

6257.36 --> 6261.5599999999995
and i'm feeling kind of good

6269.04 --> 6272.84
so do i want a section for my birthday

6271.199 --> 6277.5199999999995
or not

6272.84 --> 6280.639
well maybe if it's if it's nice looking

6277.52 --> 6282.88
but yeah i can almost guarantee you that

6280.639 --> 6285.1990000000005
kind of similar to the

6282.88 --> 6288.639
to the p900 it's probably just going to

6285.199 --> 6290.5599999999995
end up like a prop on my wall

6288.639 --> 6292.639
for real

6290.56 --> 6295.84
right

6292.639 --> 6298.400000000001
i mean i'm not like wow man i can't wait

6295.84 --> 6301.1990000000005
to like start using the section every

6298.4 --> 6302.96
single day i'm going to be a master ex

6301.199 --> 6305.759999999999
the user

6302.96 --> 6305.76
not no

6310.159 --> 6314.0
i mean maybe

6312.239 --> 6316.718999999999
maybe at some point it would be pretty

6314.0 --> 6318.96
cool to like if i had a sex and like go

6316.719 --> 6321.84
to 10th man or something or to like a

6318.96 --> 6323.6
sextant conference

6321.84 --> 6326.56
the sexton's conference right flat earth

6323.6 --> 6330.8
conference sexton conference why not

6326.56 --> 6331.6
surveyors and sexton texas explorers

6330.8 --> 6333.52
right

6331.6 --> 6336.2390000000005
then it would be pretty cool to go there

6333.52 --> 6338.639
with the sexton and maybe ask like hey

6336.239 --> 6342.159
how would you quickly size this up

6338.639 --> 6344.159000000001
using this right to basically ask people

6342.159 --> 6346.32
who are much more proficient at using

6344.159 --> 6348.799999999999
sections like tan man

6346.32 --> 6351.199
to help me instruct

6348.8 --> 6353.6
on how to like figure out how to use it

6351.199 --> 6355.839999999999
more easily because if you just give me

6353.6 --> 6358.08
a device

6355.84 --> 6360.96
and no verbal instruction nobody's

6358.08 --> 6362.719
showing me how to use it i have usually

6360.96 --> 6364.56
a bit of trouble

6362.719 --> 6367.92
figuring it out not because i couldn't

6364.56 --> 6372.119000000001
but because i just don't

6367.92 --> 6372.119
my patience gives out

6376.0 --> 6382.0
right unless it's like vital like if

6379.119 --> 6385.199
it's really really important like you

6382.0 --> 6386.96
must now know this

6385.199 --> 6389.678999999999
and then i'll let you almost like

6386.96 --> 6392.4
spiritually whipping myself like you are

6389.679 --> 6395.04
going to focus on this you are going to

6392.4 --> 6397.28
freaking learn every [ __ ] thing about

6395.04 --> 6400.239
this and you're not going to be allowed

6397.28 --> 6402.48
to rest or eat until you have it in your

6400.239 --> 6405.678999999999
head right but that doesn't really

6402.48 --> 6405.678999999999
happen a lot anymore

6408.159 --> 6412.96
i don't really feel the necessity to

6410.96 --> 6414.8
learn a sexting

6412.96 --> 6416.159
i mean it's kind of cool it's kind of

6414.8 --> 6419.04
handy

6416.159 --> 6420.96
it's a nice thing to know i'm not saying

6419.04 --> 6422.4
that sextant people are wasting their

6420.96 --> 6425.6
time

6422.4 --> 6431.32
i'm just saying it i don't see it

6425.6 --> 6431.320000000001
necessary for me personally to know it

6443.92 --> 6449.639
you go to surveyor's conferences okay

6486.8 --> 6491.719
right

6488.719 --> 6491.719
anyway

6506.48 --> 6513.08
i am making claims about the sexton what

6509.199 --> 6513.08
the hell are you talking about

6516.719 --> 6519.52
where you're putting all these words in

6518.159 --> 6523.119
my mouth

6519.52 --> 6525.360000000001
how are you blabbering about harmon

6523.119 --> 6529.239
you seem very annoying you seem like a

6525.36 --> 6529.239
very annoying person

6558.639 --> 6562.32
all right

6560.239 --> 6564.799999999999
i know about a sex and what i need to

6562.32 --> 6568.08
know i know the basic premise i know a

6564.8 --> 6570.96
sextant what it is what it roughly does

6568.08 --> 6572.239
how it works lining up angles

6570.96 --> 6576.4
yeah

6572.239 --> 6579.44
in relation to the horizon

6576.4 --> 6583.36
the horizon yeah the thing that globals

6579.44 --> 6586.799999999999
believe is the edge of a sphere

6583.36 --> 6589.44
right geometric

6586.8 --> 6592.88
yeah the text doesn't really work with

6589.44 --> 6596.719
that you can't really do that

6592.88 --> 6600.2390000000005
you have to have a flat baseline

6596.719 --> 6602.159
right you don't have that on a globe

6600.239 --> 6604.799999999999
see i know that

6602.159 --> 6608.48
that part i know because it's exactly

6604.8 --> 6611.1990000000005
what i need to know to remind you globe

6608.48 --> 6613.678999999999
zealot retards

6611.199 --> 6615.919999999999
that the earth is flat

6613.679 --> 6617.679
that you can't use a sextant on the

6615.92 --> 6621.679
globe and these anti-flat earthers

6617.679 --> 6624.96
squirting idiots keep on blabbering

6621.679 --> 6627.1990000000005
like you can you can't it's idiotic it

6624.96 --> 6629.44
doesn't work that way

6627.199 --> 6631.119
right there was no bubble

6629.44 --> 6633.199
in a sextant

6631.119 --> 6634.239
in the early exploration age that didn't

6633.199 --> 6638.919999999999
exist

6634.239 --> 6638.919999999999
people used the horizon

6639.52 --> 6644.88
lined it up with the sun

6642.159 --> 6648.0
yeah that doesn't work on the ball earth

6644.88 --> 6650.56
yeah that's all i really need to know

6648.0 --> 6654.0
i need i need to know just the right

6650.56 --> 6658.159000000001
details to take a sentence accident and

6654.0 --> 6661.679
then bash a baller's head in with it

6658.159 --> 6663.839999999999
right i don't need to be a master sexton

6661.679 --> 6666.159
user i don't have to use it in the field

6663.84 --> 6670.0
i don't have to know how to do that in

6666.159 --> 6672.96
order to know the basic premise

6670.0 --> 6675.36
that completely demolishes the globe

6672.96 --> 6677.199
earth model and the globe earth religion

6675.36 --> 6680.48
see that's enough

6677.199 --> 6682.4
that's the part that i needed to know

6680.48 --> 6684.239
that i really needed to know and that's

6682.4 --> 6686.96
why i know it now

6684.239 --> 6689.28
right because i wanted to i needed to i

6686.96 --> 6692.159
saw a useful purpose on the long run

6689.28 --> 6694.88
that's why i know it now i don't need to

6692.159 --> 6697.28
know how to operate a sextant on the

6694.88 --> 6699.04
ocean because i'm not even going on the

6697.28 --> 6701.599
ocean i never

6699.04 --> 6706.0
go anywhere

6701.599 --> 6706.0
i barely go outside of my own city

6706.88 --> 6709.84
right

6713.04 --> 6718.719
just line this side

6715.119 --> 6720.4
yeah we know yeah it's just a flat

6718.719 --> 6723.92
flat baseline

6720.4 --> 6726.32
yeah angle angles 90 degree angle flat

6723.92 --> 6729.4400000000005
baseline yeah flat earth horizon not

6726.32 --> 6733.04
geometric we know howard moore

6729.44 --> 6735.36
we know earth is flat

6733.04 --> 6737.599
can't use a sextant on the globe

6735.36 --> 6740.48
if the earth were a globe a section

6737.599 --> 6742.4800000000005
would be a completely and utterly

6740.48 --> 6744.879999999999
useless tool

6742.48 --> 6747.598999999999
you wouldn't be able to do anything with

6744.88 --> 6748.400000000001
it it wouldn't be a handy exploration

6747.599 --> 6751.84
tool

6748.4 --> 6755.759999999999
because you couldn't explore

6751.84 --> 6760.04
beyond a very basic limited reach

6755.76 --> 6760.04
it would be completely useless

6764.88 --> 6770.08
does using a section in the video game

6767.04 --> 6773.199
count well if the video game has

6770.08 --> 6775.679
like the real world a flat

6773.199 --> 6778.799999999999
simulated surface

6775.679 --> 6780.4800000000005
of the ocean then yes yes you can use it

6778.8 --> 6783.92
if you try to put

6780.48 --> 6784.718999999999
a sextant into a simulation that is on a

6783.92 --> 6787.84
ball

6784.719 --> 6788.719
then it's not gonna work

6787.84 --> 6790.719
yeah

6788.719 --> 6793.84
that's right because it doesn't work on

6790.719 --> 6793.84
the ball

6794.08 --> 6800.04
you don't know it doesn't akuma virus

6796.239 --> 6800.04
shut the [ __ ] up

6807.119 --> 6812.139999999999
okay

6809.01 --> 6812.14
[Music]

6826.8 --> 6830.719
right i'm gonna take two minute break be

6829.119 --> 6832.719
right back

6830.719 --> 6835.92
l

6832.719 --> 6838.56
he does he does no it doesn't

6835.92 --> 6838.56
[ __ ] off

6839.84 --> 6845.119000000001
if it's gonna be yeah it does then [ __ ]

6842.32 --> 6847.36
off no it doesn't

6845.119 --> 6850.799999999999
you have no evidence it does you don't

6847.36 --> 6853.5199999999995
even do [ __ ] simulations on a globe

6850.8 --> 6854.719
okay you don't even try to freaking

6853.52 --> 6856.8
simulate

6854.719 --> 6860.2390000000005
a sexton on the globe besides your

6856.8 --> 6864.0
stupid autographic view [ __ ] which

6860.239 --> 6866.4
isn't a simulation yeah

6864.0 --> 6871.159
no you don't you don't use a sextant on

6866.4 --> 6871.159
the globe you don't even simulate it

6939.679 --> 6942.679
so

6952.08 --> 6955.08
so

6967.28 --> 6970.28
hmm

6987.84 --> 6989.92
you

7002.8 --> 7005.8
so

7032.0 --> 7037.199
into outer space

7034.159 --> 7039.598999999999
there is no outer space dumbass

7037.199 --> 7041.119
doesn't exist

7039.599 --> 7042.88
can't go there it's a second law of

7041.119 --> 7046.719
thermodynamics violation that's not a

7042.88 --> 7050.639
conspiracy theory that's a natural law

7046.719 --> 7052.8
physics natural law agreed upon

7050.639 --> 7056.159000000001
yeah agreed upon because there is no

7052.8 --> 7059.119000000001
exception that can be demonstrated

7056.159 --> 7061.759999999999
outer space can't exist

7059.119 --> 7064.159
you can't photograph earth

7061.76 --> 7066.8
from a place that doesn't exist because

7064.159 --> 7071.32
it can't exist because physics makes

7066.8 --> 7071.320000000001
that impossible to exist

7080.96 --> 7086.32
not to disturb my echo chamber excuse me

7086.719 --> 7091.84
the [ __ ] are you blabbering about echo

7088.8 --> 7093.4400000000005
chamber you've been in my chat and i

7091.84 --> 7096.32
have addressed you

7093.44 --> 7098.08
for like the last half hour at least who

7096.32 --> 7100.0
the [ __ ] are you to tell me we're in an

7098.08 --> 7103.199
echo chamber i've been having a

7100.0 --> 7104.639
discussion with you a glober

7103.199 --> 7107.919999999999
in my chat

7104.639 --> 7107.92
what echo chamber

7108.239 --> 7112.959999999999
unless you're calling yourself the echo

7111.119 --> 7114.719
in my echo chamber

7112.96 --> 7117.92
because you're still echoing the same

7114.719 --> 7118.88
ball tarted nonsense

7117.92 --> 7120.08
yeah

7118.88 --> 7122.2390000000005
don't

7120.08 --> 7124.08
how the [ __ ] are you even justifying

7122.239 --> 7127.119
calling this an echo chamber after

7124.08 --> 7129.84
having like discussions with me half an

7127.119 --> 7131.598999999999
hour and more

7129.84 --> 7134.76
you even think about what comes out of

7131.599 --> 7134.76
your mouth

7164.56 --> 7169.679
yeah flatters a kumu virus is kind of a

7167.199 --> 7171.759999999999
waste of time to try to debate he's just

7169.679 --> 7174.2390000000005
like a rag doll

7171.76 --> 7178.0
just he won't listen he'll just insert

7174.239 --> 7180.638999999999
the dumbest thing you can think of

7178.0 --> 7183.199
and then let you get angry at him over

7180.639 --> 7185.1990000000005
that so he can laugh at you about how he

7183.199 --> 7187.199
doesn't care about that because that's

7185.199 --> 7189.44
what the kumu virus does he's actually

7187.199 --> 7190.719
completely useless

7189.44 --> 7194.0
in a debate

7190.719 --> 7196.96
completely and utterly useless

7194.0 --> 7198.88
as we've all learned

7196.96 --> 7200.32
by example

7198.88 --> 7202.8
through the flat earth debates when he

7200.32 --> 7205.799999999999
actually gets on there it's completely

7202.8 --> 7205.8
useless

7221.04 --> 7226.96
just look up god

7223.119 --> 7228.88
right this is not gonna end

7226.96 --> 7231.28
they'll just keep on going and going and

7228.88 --> 7231.28
going

7231.599 --> 7239.400000000001
i however am gonna end my show

7234.96 --> 7239.4
because i've gone for two hours now

7240.0 --> 7244.239
so yeah it was a pretty good birthday

7242.0 --> 7246.32
show lots of flat earth today i actually

7244.239 --> 7247.04
talked about the details a lot i liked

7246.32 --> 7249.44
it

7247.04 --> 7252.0
can't fix stupid yeah i know you can't

7249.44 --> 7255.239
fix stupid it can only fix itself if

7252.0 --> 7255.239
you're lucky

7257.04 --> 7259.28
right

7259.92 --> 7265.599
right when you say can't fix stupid it's

7262.719 --> 7268.159
rather like you can't

7265.599 --> 7270.32
force a willingly ignorant person to

7268.159 --> 7271.44
learn something i think that would be a

7270.32 --> 7274.0
more

7271.44 --> 7276.48
specific like on target

7274.0 --> 7276.48
statement

7278.0 --> 7283.92
because you can actually fix stupid in

7280.08 --> 7286.4
ways if the stupid is willing to

7283.92 --> 7288.56
to try to overcome its stupidity yeah it

7286.4 --> 7292.239
can be fixed but it has to be the it's

7288.56 --> 7292.2390000000005
always the willingness part right

7293.92 --> 7299.28
i think the the entire saying should be

7296.4 --> 7301.598999999999
renamed just can't fix the willing

7299.28 --> 7303.44
stupid you're willing to be stupid you

7301.599 --> 7305.84
can't fix it

7303.44 --> 7307.678999999999
if something is stupid and it wants to

7305.84 --> 7311.639
not be stupid anymore then it can

7307.679 --> 7311.639
potentially be fixed

7312.159 --> 7316.239
right

7313.679 --> 7318.159
anyway thanks everyone for coming

7424.48 --> 7428.638999999999
dig for damage that

7426.8 --> 7431.84
they can go [ __ ] himself

7428.639 --> 7431.84
right anyway

7432.56 --> 7439.8
yeah until the next video
