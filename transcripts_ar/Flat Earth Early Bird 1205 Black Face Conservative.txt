97.28 --> 102.56
quite a turnaround

100.4 --> 104.56
yuck

102.56 --> 107.28
it's rainy

104.56 --> 107.28
it's windy

109.759 --> 115.759
kind of cold although it could be worse

113.119 --> 120.159
yeah you probably can't see much with

115.759 --> 120.159
all the raindrops on the window here but

122.159 --> 126.28
let me see if i can

128.399 --> 131.84
i guess it's not much different

138.72 --> 141.72
yep

142.959 --> 149.44
huh webcam did not freeze up yeah it was

146.16 --> 152.4
the update it wasn't even my usb port it

149.44 --> 152.4
was just obs

154.84 --> 162.16
anyways crockett first in chat

158.319 --> 162.16
matthew holt good to see you

162.879 --> 169.0
it is monday the 4th of april 2022.

169.28 --> 175.2
yeah i'm starting a little late

172.0 --> 175.2
more late than usual

175.28 --> 181.2
because

177.04 --> 181.2
i really felt like getting a cousin

181.519 --> 185.20000000000002
when i woke up

183.599 --> 187.28
so i went out for groceries in the

185.2 --> 188.72
shitty weather and so i wouldn't yeah i

187.28 --> 191.12
have to do that during the flat earth

188.72 --> 193.35999999999999
debates

191.12 --> 196.84
but yeah i did get a car song

193.36 --> 198.48000000000002
but it was not the usual type

196.84 --> 201.04
and

198.48 --> 201.04
this thing

201.36 --> 206.08
even though it might look like a

203.12 --> 209.04
crossover it's not a cursor

206.08 --> 211.59900000000002
it's like regular bread disguised as a

209.04 --> 214.319
croissant and it's gross

211.599 --> 216.64
and i'm gonna tell the store that

214.319 --> 218.72
like this is not a casa

216.64 --> 221.04
it doesn't taste like one

218.72 --> 223.599
at all

221.04 --> 225.76
so yeah

223.599 --> 228.48
now i know probably going to feed this

225.76 --> 231.92
to the birds later on because it's like

228.48 --> 235.51899999999998
even the aftertaste is just gross

231.92 --> 237.67999999999998
like not like a song at all

235.519 --> 240.0
yeah

237.68 --> 243.59900000000002
i'm thinking

240.0 --> 243.599
maybe i'm gonna make my own

243.84 --> 249.28
i mean i do have like an oven

246.72 --> 251.35999999999999
could potentially like make

249.28 --> 255.0
them myself

251.36 --> 255.0
yeah make them myself

255.36 --> 259.84000000000003
so yeah i might investigate it might

257.28 --> 262.15999999999997
even be cheaper right

259.84 --> 262.15999999999997
buying

262.32 --> 266.71999999999997
fully made croissants is not organic is

264.96 --> 268.71999999999997
not exactly the cheapest thing in the

266.72 --> 270.56
world although

268.72 --> 271.759
there's more expensive foods out there

270.56 --> 274.759
as well

271.759 --> 274.759
right

282.56 --> 287.12
right yeah matthew hall

284.4 --> 287.12
yeah i get that

287.759 --> 291.36
yeah

288.72 --> 296.6
when it rains in the forest especially

291.36 --> 296.6
when it's been dry a lot a long time

296.72 --> 301.03900000000004
it yeah

298.56 --> 304.639
like a lot of the plants do kind of

301.039 --> 307.28
release a smell so i i get it i really

304.639 --> 309.039
like this the smell of the forest when

307.28 --> 312.23999999999995
it's raining

309.039 --> 314.15999999999997
or when it just rained

312.24 --> 318.52
but it is the plants

314.16 --> 318.52000000000004
anyway hello borders boy

325.6 --> 333.65000000000003
yeah yeah i know what you mean matthew

329.12 --> 337.02
hmm anyway i got a gusto

333.65 --> 337.02
[Music]

340.16 --> 343.88000000000005
and i got some tea

350.95 --> 354.09999999999997
[Music]

354.32 --> 358.96
right so yeah yesterday's show i watched

356.8 --> 362.24
it back completely

358.96 --> 362.23999999999995
and it was really good

365.759 --> 371.84000000000003
like especially the esoterics

368.639 --> 372.96000000000004
concerning religion i was just really

371.84 --> 374.79999999999995
good

372.96 --> 376.479
very proud of that

374.8 --> 378.56
and i did manage to find the proper

376.479 --> 380.24
title for the show as well

378.56 --> 383.24
if you might just know as you might have

380.24 --> 383.24
noticed

397.6 --> 400.88
and it's also kind of funny to watch

399.6 --> 403.199
back

400.88 --> 405.12
like when i'm that good and then notice

403.199 --> 408.639
how flustered i get like hey why is it

405.12 --> 411.68
so silent where is everybody

408.639 --> 413.28000000000003
but when i'm listening then i

411.68 --> 415.68
am not like

413.28 --> 416.63899999999995
in the occupation of actually rolling it

415.68 --> 418.72
out

416.639 --> 419.919
and then i can get kind of entranced

418.72 --> 422.40000000000003
myself

419.919 --> 424.639
so i was able to experience in a way

422.4 --> 426.15999999999997
what the audience was like whoa i'm

424.639 --> 428.40000000000003
really getting caught up in the dream

426.16 --> 428.40000000000003
here

429.52 --> 432.639
it's kind of funny to experience that

431.44 --> 436.28
myself

432.639 --> 436.28000000000003
from my own work

438.0 --> 440.8
right

439.84 --> 445.039
anyway

440.8 --> 445.039
it was a great show very happy with it

447.52 --> 453.28
it's a it's a good one to to link up

451.759 --> 454.88
if you want

453.28 --> 458.08
if you want to try to make people

454.88 --> 460.15999999999997
understand well the false dichotomies

458.08 --> 462.88
that people get caught up

460.16 --> 467.03900000000004
with concerning religion

462.88 --> 469.919
because it was kind of a universal theme

467.039 --> 473.199
of course it sprung forth from

469.919 --> 477.15999999999997
jesus christ but i even drew in like the

473.199 --> 477.16
parallels with other religions

478.08 --> 483.84
so yeah very happy about that show

482.24 --> 486.16
and if you haven't watched that or you

483.84 --> 489.35999999999996
weren't there then i definitely

486.16 --> 489.36
recommend you watch it

491.199 --> 496.08000000000004
anyway

492.639 --> 496.08
don't know what i'm gonna do today

497.44 --> 499.68
uh

500.0 --> 504.56
weird a little bit of a rough night just

502.319 --> 506.96000000000004
like

504.56 --> 508.72
weird

506.96 --> 510.479
tension cramps

508.72 --> 512.719
i but i think it has to do with the

510.479 --> 514.64
weather change

512.719 --> 516.6400000000001
started like last night and i couldn't

514.64 --> 517.919
place it like

516.64 --> 520.56
like micro

517.919 --> 522.3199999999999
cramp like pains and just like couldn't

520.56 --> 526.2399999999999
really pinpoint it down there's nothing

522.32 --> 528.6400000000001
like i ate that was very unusual

526.24 --> 531.279
so it was like ah what is this but yeah

528.64 --> 533.519
today with the weather it has become i

531.279 --> 535.12
understand

533.519 --> 537.44
it was probably because of the weather

535.12 --> 537.44
change

546.959 --> 552.7199999999999
right but this way plants still get

550.0 --> 552.72
enough water

553.36 --> 557.2
it can't always be beautiful weather

558.88 --> 563.8389999999999
anyway hello neil you knew the grass

561.12 --> 563.839
tyson lies

564.16 --> 570.56
oh yeah i also watched back

567.12 --> 573.04
the the premiere on fed

570.56 --> 574.64
was it really late though was a sunday

573.04 --> 576.88
night

574.64 --> 579.279
like after 12 even

576.88 --> 582.399
but that was a great show was the friday

579.279 --> 582.399
show it was great

585.519 --> 591.839
no notification from youtube kevlar

588.88 --> 591.8389999999999
okay

597.279 --> 601.68
right well yeah

599.68 --> 605.399
can't always rely on the notification

601.68 --> 605.399
system right

606.48 --> 611.76
but usually

609.04 --> 614.079
i show up like within the first half

611.76 --> 614.079
hour

617.279 --> 621.279
so you can always expect me and like why

619.76 --> 624.079
not just

621.279 --> 626.24
open up my youtube page

624.079 --> 629.76
then just refresh every now and then and

626.24 --> 633.64
you'll you'll see anyway

629.76 --> 633.64
good to have you all here

638.079 --> 643.1999999999999
own benjamin had a little sunday stream

641.68 --> 645.04

643.2 --> 647.839
but yeah i only noticed that this

645.04 --> 647.8389999999999

so that was kind of fun listening to

650.8 --> 657.5999999999999

676.0 --> 681.12
refraction video

678.24 --> 682.399
it's a typical theme of sky free

681.12 --> 684.72
i was like

682.399 --> 686.72
actual video material showing you just

684.72 --> 688.88
how refraction and the diffraction

686.72 --> 691.44

688.88 --> 691.4399999999999

never heard of the guy but he was pretty

732.56 --> 735.5999999999999

734.24 --> 737.839
energetic

735.6 --> 739.9200000000001

i'm always on the show and

841.36 --> 846.5600000000001
we're kind of

842.72 --> 846.5600000000001
doing a lockstep schedule

848.72 --> 850.5600000000001
right

849.519 --> 852.9590000000001
so then

850.56 --> 855.1199999999999
still very thankful for but i kind of

852.959 --> 858.16
get to expect that happening every now

855.12 --> 860.8
and then but like on gym bob i just

858.16 --> 863.36
visit the chat you know so to then just

860.8 --> 866.0

878.959 --> 886.0989999999999
people in the chat doing that

882.97 --> 886.099
[Music]

891.68 --> 896.3199999999999
oh you haven't

893.519 --> 899.839
got it set up yet just email me if you

896.32 --> 902.32
want you can post your email address

899.839 --> 904.1600000000001
here for people who want to contact you

902.32 --> 907.0400000000001
through email to get it

904.16 --> 907.04
seeking star wars

909.6 --> 915.0
ajs palmer

911.519 --> 915.0
there with 306.

915.63 --> 918.769
[Music]

926.959 --> 931.199
okay yeah terra 306

928.959 --> 933.5999999999999
when will nathan create the wall of

931.199 --> 936.3199999999999
shame for anti-flat earthers well i

933.6 --> 937.36
think it's already there

936.32 --> 940.1600000000001
and

937.36 --> 941.6
we already kind of get caught up talking

940.16 --> 944.56
about it

941.6 --> 946.8000000000001
on a daily basis

944.56 --> 946.8
right

947.6 --> 954.0400000000001
so it would effectively just be a bit of

949.839 --> 954.0400000000001
an extra visual gimmick

960.399 --> 966.639
but yeah i will think about it

963.6 --> 970.72
when the time is right i will i will ask

966.639 --> 973.759
like hey what about a wall of shame

970.72 --> 973.759
like visually

977.44 --> 980.8800000000001
all right

979.36 --> 982.9590000000001
so we'll see

980.88 --> 986.959
but it's it's technically already there

982.959 --> 986.959
just woven into the regular show

988.639 --> 993.6
a special one hours

991.6 --> 996.0
it's a funny bashing from the whole

993.6 --> 998.32
month

996.0 --> 998.32
what

999.12 --> 1003.68
no

1000.16 --> 1006.079
no that would be way too much work

1003.68 --> 1009.5999999999999
and like how long should like in one

1006.079 --> 1012.399
hour you're gonna fit all that

1009.6 --> 1014.88
there's no way that's gonna fit

1012.399 --> 1018.519
that's gonna be like a five to ten hour

1014.88 --> 1018.519
show every month

1021.09 --> 1024.159
[Music]

1032.4 --> 1036.0
i mean technically you know as an

1034.4 --> 1039.52
outsider

1036.0 --> 1042.72
you could do it

1039.52 --> 1045.039
an outsider could literally just take

1042.72 --> 1046.799
the clips

1045.039 --> 1048.4
and then make it

1046.799 --> 1051.2
like they could

1048.4 --> 1053.6000000000001
do an item about the flat earth debates

1051.2 --> 1055.52
and the anti-flat earth that is that

1053.6 --> 1058.48
have been active there right you could

1055.52 --> 1061.039
do it and just make a little video

1058.48 --> 1065.16
item yourself if you want to

1061.039 --> 1065.16
if you know how to edit it

1068.24 --> 1074.24
yeah no but tara look

1070.64 --> 1077.2
nathan spends a lot of time every day

1074.24 --> 1080.84
video editing like seriously dude

1077.2 --> 1080.8400000000001
he spends hours

1083.6 --> 1087.84
it it's quite time consuming

1086.4 --> 1091.72
even if you're

1087.84 --> 1091.72
like good at it

1096.64 --> 1099.789
[Music]

1124.21 --> 1127.799
[Music]

1133.76 --> 1138.4
creates a wall of shame thumbnail then

1140.64 --> 1143.039
right

1143.52 --> 1149.48
yeah like a clipboard

1146.24 --> 1149.48
with photographs

1153.36 --> 1158.08
he might already like have one of those

1155.679 --> 1159.52
like in the slideshow like i have you

1158.08 --> 1161.6789999999999
actually looked through the new

1159.52 --> 1163.44
slideshow nathan set up for the

1161.679 --> 1166.48
background of the show

1163.44 --> 1169.2
because there's a lot of pictures in

1166.48 --> 1172.88
there a lot more than the previous

1169.2 --> 1172.88
slideshow that had me in it twice

1173.36 --> 1179.1599999999999
there's like hundreds of pictures in

1175.52 --> 1179.16
this one i think

1179.679 --> 1186.0
right but hey nobody's stopping you

1183.6 --> 1187.52
from making what you're envisioning

1186.0 --> 1189.28
right

1187.52 --> 1191.039
you're not gonna get like a copyright

1189.28 --> 1193.84
strike if you make something that's like

1191.039 --> 1193.84
really awesome

1193.919 --> 1199.3600000000001
nathan might just

1196.32 --> 1199.36
put it into his show

1202.799 --> 1207.36
right so

1204.64 --> 1209.1200000000001
if you're really inspired consider

1207.36 --> 1212.559
you making it

1209.12 --> 1212.559
nathan doesn't have a lot of time

1214.08 --> 1218.52
hey flatter sage good to see you

1221.76 --> 1225.919
nathan version of cueing empty eclipse

1224.64 --> 1228.3200000000002
dude tear it

1225.919 --> 1228.3200000000002
tear it

1230.88 --> 1236.5590000000002
i hope you've been listening

1232.96 --> 1238.559
already said there's all these things

1236.559 --> 1241.28
he doesn't have the time

1238.559 --> 1245.24
you could if you have the time

1241.28 --> 1245.24
and you're inspired

1249.679 --> 1254.5590000000002
i mean i'm sure nathan doesn't mind if

1251.76 --> 1257.76
somebody else makes something concerning

1254.559 --> 1257.76
the flat earth debate show

1260.72 --> 1265.919
it's not gonna copyright strike you or

1262.559 --> 1265.9189999999999
anything it's yeah so

1266.24 --> 1271.0
but he just doesn't have a lot of time

1284.08 --> 1287.08
great

1303.76 --> 1306.76
ugh

1319.76 --> 1322.72
hey adam price

1322.96 --> 1327.52
good to see you

1325.2 --> 1327.52
all right

1328.799 --> 1334.559
i had another unexpected influx in my

1332.24 --> 1337.679
gti thing

1334.559 --> 1339.52
can't even pinpoint where it came from

1337.679 --> 1340.72
but

1339.52 --> 1342.96
yeah

1340.72 --> 1345.039
i mean if this keeps on happening and

1342.96 --> 1347.3600000000001
the amounts become bigger then at some

1345.039 --> 1349.28
point i might actually try to cash it

1347.36 --> 1353.12
out

1349.28 --> 1353.12
don't know if i even can at this point

1353.679 --> 1360.0800000000002
and yeah who knows how much actual money

1356.0 --> 1361.679
i could get out of there in a single go

1360.08 --> 1364.08
but yeah

1361.679 --> 1366.799
as i kind of hinted at in the past like

1364.08 --> 1368.72
it's broken it's not really reliable but

1366.799 --> 1371.039
sometimes like

1368.72 --> 1373.6000000000001
just like a big pile of money or

1371.039 --> 1375.76
apparent money it's because it's not

1373.6 --> 1377.9189999999999
like you can literally just

1375.76 --> 1381.36
take a cash card to a machine and then

1377.919 --> 1384.0800000000002
get the money out of there like that

1381.36 --> 1386.84
but yeah it might be kind of coming back

1384.08 --> 1388.48
to life like a really old

1386.84 --> 1390.32
route

1388.48 --> 1393.28
like something coming out of there after

1390.32 --> 1396.3999999999999
all so we'll see i'll keep you updated

1393.28 --> 1398.8799999999999
if i can get anything out of it

1396.4 --> 1403.0
i mean that would certainly be

1398.88 --> 1403.0
really ideal for me

1403.36 --> 1406.32
imagine that i could just suddenly get

1405.12 --> 1410.08
like

1406.32 --> 1410.08
3 000 euros out of there

1413.12 --> 1417.1999999999998
yeah no idea if

1415.28 --> 1419.32
if what is in there right now would

1417.2 --> 1423.039
actually translate to such an amount

1419.32 --> 1424.559
[Music]

1423.039 --> 1426.64
anyway

1424.559 --> 1428.6399999999999
so yeah maybe some unexpected good

1426.64 --> 1432.24
financial news somewhere in the future i

1428.64 --> 1432.88
don't know yet right it's like

1432.24 --> 1436.32
i

1432.88 --> 1438.4
have a bit of hope but i know like yeah

1436.32 --> 1441.52
it's gonna have to be an actual number

1438.4 --> 1445.8400000000001
in my bank account before i i can really

1441.52 --> 1445.84
like commit to this hope

1447.919 --> 1453.72
gotta stay pragmatic

1450.72 --> 1453.72
anyway

1470.159 --> 1473.159
right

1473.52 --> 1477.12

it's five degrees right okay so yeah

1609.12 --> 1612.3999999999999

now the temperature is 7 degrees celsius

1618.72 --> 1622.799
which is 45 degrees fahrenheit

1621.44 --> 1626.3600000000001
i guess

1622.799 --> 1626.36

by the way

1800.08 --> 1803.039
crime minister

1804.159 --> 1807.48
that's sneaky

1827.52 --> 1835.559

1831.679 --> 1835.5590000000002
kind of moon aren't you

1856.72 --> 1860.44
okay adam price

1864.48 --> 1869.88
i'm not really familiar with with his

1866.88 --> 1869.88
music

1893.36 --> 1895.6
whoa

1897.36 --> 1901.039
the chicken alarm's going off

1904.96 --> 1911.96
okay hear that

1907.519 --> 1911.96
not turn too many car noises

1930.799 --> 1935.6
it's

1932.84 --> 1936.9599999999998
hilarious it's so funny now because like

1935.6 --> 1940.32
as a kid

1936.96 --> 1943.039
in my old folks home

1940.32 --> 1945.519
i was always like annoyed by

1943.039 --> 1947.76
by chicken noises

1945.519 --> 1949.919
for some reason there was a farm like

1947.76 --> 1952.1589999999999
across the street

1949.919 --> 1955.1200000000001
but now every time i hear chickens just

1952.159 --> 1956.96
doing their thing i'm always like yay

1955.12 --> 1959.76
i really like them now

1956.96 --> 1959.76
for some reason

1959.919 --> 1964.72
i don't understand why i didn't like

1961.679 --> 1966.72
that sound when i was a kid

1964.72 --> 1969.2
maybe because it was for some reason in

1966.72 --> 1971.2
my mind associated with work and i

1969.2 --> 1973.2
didn't want to do work or something like

1971.2 --> 1977.3990000000001
i don't know man

1973.2 --> 1977.3990000000001
talking about my teens mostly

1985.2 --> 1989.279
but yeah at this point if i ever get

1987.039 --> 1991.44
like a bigger place with the garden i

1989.279 --> 1993.76
might just get a chicken not even for

1991.44 --> 1997.6000000000001
the eggs but just because

1993.76 --> 1997.6
because of the the chicken noises

1998.559 --> 2003.279
i just like it

2001.36 --> 2005.84
but i probably also would go for some

2003.279 --> 2005.84
eggs

2010.159 --> 2016.3200000000002
and then i'm gonna try to

2013.2 --> 2016.32
get a new cat too

2017.12 --> 2022.2399999999998
that would well as a little kitten have

2019.679 --> 2023.3600000000001
to grow up with chickens

2022.24 --> 2025.919
so that

2023.36 --> 2028.4799999999998
he's not gonna hunt chickens when he

2025.919 --> 2030.0800000000002
grows older

2028.48 --> 2033.919
that would be awesome

2030.08 --> 2037.6
i think i could probably get some really

2033.919 --> 2037.6000000000001
adorable videos out of that

2039.76 --> 2043.76
ah thinking about the future

2043.919 --> 2049.6
the future the future where i'm

2046.0 --> 2049.6
certainly not poor anymore

2050.32 --> 2053.679
no idea

2051.679 --> 2055.76
if that's ever going to happen but you

2053.679 --> 2060.76
never really know

2055.76 --> 2060.76
especially with a weird system like gti

2070.56 --> 2073.7599999999998
i mean if suddenly there's gonna like

2072.56 --> 2077.44
roll

2073.76 --> 2080.079
thousands of euros out of that thing

2077.44 --> 2083.2000000000003
on a periodic basis i yeah that that

2080.079 --> 2085.9190000000003
would like help a lot

2083.2 --> 2089.6389999999997
but yeah let's see if that actually even

2085.919 --> 2089.6389999999997
works just once

2089.76 --> 2094.48
so that i don't like get my hopes up and

2092.879 --> 2097.52
and try to

2094.48 --> 2101.16
put full weight on that hope without a

2097.52 --> 2101.16
guarantee of success

2109.08 --> 2112.119
[Music]

2118.72 --> 2121.72
hmm

2134.64 --> 2137.64
what

2144.64 --> 2149.5989999999997
told your black friend about his

2147.119 --> 2152.0
blackface incident and now he hates him

2149.599 --> 2154.8
too oh

2152.0 --> 2157.599
i always thought that was like the one

2154.8 --> 2161.44
kind of goofy funny thing about him but

2157.599 --> 2164.32
then again i am dutch and i'm

2161.44 --> 2167.52
like i refuse

2164.32 --> 2170.56
to have blackface tradition taken away

2167.52 --> 2173.28
from us it's integral to our

2170.56 --> 2174.7999999999997
national form of christmas

2173.28 --> 2176.48
you're gonna have to learn and live with

2174.8 --> 2178.7200000000003
it

2176.48 --> 2182.0
never letting that go

2178.72 --> 2183.68
like if i have to go through life

2182.0 --> 2186.4
at some point

2183.68 --> 2187.7599999999998
blackface every day

2186.4 --> 2189.2000000000003
just

2187.76 --> 2191.599
to

2189.2 --> 2193.4399999999996
yeah to help people get over that than i

2191.599 --> 2195.92
probably would

2193.44 --> 2199.56
probably not but

2195.92 --> 2199.56
you get my point

2202.64 --> 2206.7999999999997
yeah

2204.48 --> 2209.28
and besides here the tradition when you

2206.8 --> 2212.5600000000004
wear black faces appear is

2209.28 --> 2215.599
you still act like a decent human being

2212.56 --> 2217.119
right it's not meant as like oh look at

2215.599 --> 2218.7200000000003
us we're so

2217.119 --> 2220.8
we're stupid

2218.72 --> 2223.5989999999997
negroes or something like you don't act

2220.8 --> 2225.8390000000004
like that it's not about that so yeah

2223.599 --> 2229.6800000000003
black people just need to stop listening

2225.839 --> 2232.16
to the whiny liberal complaining pants

2229.68 --> 2234.3999999999996
about that and just let off us have our

2232.16 --> 2237.2799999999997
tradition

2234.4 --> 2239.04
right now what trudeau was doing with it

2237.28 --> 2241.8390000000004
however

2239.04 --> 2244.48
is more creepy

2241.839 --> 2246.0
it's like oh funky parties

2244.48 --> 2248.32
and then doing it almost like it's

2246.0 --> 2251.119
halloween or something

2248.32 --> 2253.04
that's kind of weird i agree

2251.119 --> 2254.88
but out of principle

2253.04 --> 2258.72
i have to say

2254.88 --> 2261.44
yeah i'm pro blackface

2258.72 --> 2261.4399999999996
i like it

2265.2 --> 2270.3999999999996
i like it just as much

2267.359 --> 2272.96
as i like awesome black folks

2270.4 --> 2275.04
like for example chocolate saiyan

2272.96 --> 2277.44
and elijah

2275.04 --> 2280.48
and yeah they might not agree with me

2277.44 --> 2284.32
about the black face i don't care

2280.48 --> 2287.359
i like them and i like blackface

2284.32 --> 2289.28
and i'm never gonna let

2287.359 --> 2290.48
the jew

2289.28 --> 2293.92
make them

2290.48 --> 2293.92
take it away from us

2294.16 --> 2297.3199999999997
you understand

2302.0 --> 2308.24
but yeah despite that despite his

2305.28 --> 2310.0
blackface virtue trudeau is kind of a

2308.24 --> 2311.2799999999997
dick

2310.0 --> 2314.8
and

2311.28 --> 2316.5600000000004
a bit of a dictator wannabe or maybe not

2314.8 --> 2317.92
even wannabe he's just doing it really

2316.56 --> 2320.32
at this point

2317.92 --> 2323.6800000000003
but he's a bit of a wussy too he's not

2320.32 --> 2325.3590000000004
like a strong type of man

2323.68 --> 2328.16
but yeah at least

2325.359 --> 2330.0789999999997
he had a blackface virtue like that's

2328.16 --> 2332.72
the one thing that that was still kind

2330.079 --> 2335.3590000000004
of good about him you know but blackface

2332.72 --> 2337.04
can only get you so far

2335.359 --> 2338.96
if you're going to act like a dictator

2337.04 --> 2343.24
doesn't really matter what kind of cool

2338.96 --> 2343.2400000000002
thing she did in the past you know

2351.6 --> 2356.99
[Music]

2357.76 --> 2362.7200000000003
how is he still in power how is

2359.44 --> 2365.52
everything still in power flatter sage

2362.72 --> 2367.52
it's there because the constituents are

2365.52 --> 2369.28
just as demonic

2367.52 --> 2371.04
as they are

2369.28 --> 2373.119
they're like yeah

2371.04 --> 2376.4
finally somebody

2373.119 --> 2378.7200000000003
that just says [ __ ] you all

2376.4 --> 2381.44
we're gonna take over and mind control

2378.72 --> 2383.4399999999996
you yay

2381.44 --> 2384.96
it's unfortunately because he's not

2383.44 --> 2388.2400000000002
alone right

2384.96 --> 2390.32
a dictator freak like that

2388.24 --> 2393.04
on his on their own doesn't do anything

2390.32 --> 2394.839
it's because people vote for him that

2393.04 --> 2397.7599999999998
actually want

2394.839 --> 2400.32
that because they're like demon

2397.76 --> 2400.32
possessed

2400.48 --> 2407.359
and idiotic

2403.119 --> 2411.079
and they lost track of humanity

2407.359 --> 2411.0789999999997
that's how they're empowered

2416.48 --> 2422.48
or maybe it was the blackface maybe if

2418.64 --> 2424.319
you put on blackface in your past

2422.48 --> 2426.2400000000002
people will just not take you out of

2424.319 --> 2428.48
power when you're a dictator maybe it's

2426.24 --> 2431.839
that awesome

2428.48 --> 2434.0
maybe blackface is just so awesome that

2431.839 --> 2435.44
even if you turn into a dictator later

2434.0 --> 2438.24
in life

2435.44 --> 2440.2400000000002
people will just take it because you

2438.24 --> 2443.24
were awesome enough to actually put on

2440.24 --> 2443.24
blackface

2452.48 --> 2457.04
yeah for those who are vaccine damaged

2455.28 --> 2458.96
yeah you might not have caught on that

2457.04 --> 2460.96
by now this has turned into kind of a

2458.96 --> 2465.16
silly joke

2460.96 --> 2465.16
i hope you realize that

2466.0 --> 2471.28
i don't actually think wearing blackface

2468.48 --> 2471.28
is a virtue

2474.88 --> 2481.44
although i might just

2477.599 --> 2483.76
take it as such just to shove it in your

2481.44 --> 2483.76
face

2485.28 --> 2491.599
right i might just

2488.48 --> 2495.44
start a religion where blackface is

2491.599 --> 2498.0
mandatory for the priesthood

2495.44 --> 2498.96
like you have to do that it's a holy

2498.0 --> 2501.599
deed

2498.96 --> 2503.2
i might just do it

2501.599 --> 2506.079
just because of

2503.2 --> 2509.4399999999996
how the squirt boys and

2506.079 --> 2513.88
are acting out there in the face of it

2509.44 --> 2513.88
the face of it

2534.8 --> 2539.04
i like the words pulled off in tropical

2536.8 --> 2541.76
thunder

2539.04 --> 2545.04
i don't remember that

2541.76 --> 2545.0400000000004
i have to watch that back

2545.28 --> 2549.119
a vague

2546.96 --> 2550.8
vague memory that there was something

2549.119 --> 2552.96
like that in there

2550.8 --> 2555.04
i have to see that back right i'm by the

2552.96 --> 2559.119
way i'm not talking about blackface in

2555.04 --> 2562.319
movies necessarily i'm talking about

2559.119 --> 2562.319
just in the real world

2563.52 --> 2570.319
i'm not saying like oh man we really

2566.68 --> 2574.0
really need blackface back in hollywood

2570.319 --> 2574.0
or something it's just like uh

2575.76 --> 2579.92
i don't know about that one right it's

2578.0 --> 2581.839
not about that this is not about like oh

2579.92 --> 2586.2400000000002
blackface in movies

2581.839 --> 2589.04
no i'm talking about traditions

2586.24 --> 2592.16
just cultural traditions where blackface

2589.04 --> 2594.72
is involved

2592.16 --> 2597.92
i don't want blackface back in movies

2594.72 --> 2597.9199999999996
that would just be weird

2598.64 --> 2603.5989999999997
unless

2599.68 --> 2605.52
some guy is like really inspired to be

2603.599 --> 2607.44
all black yo and

2605.52 --> 2612.0
actually make it fun right then i'd be

2607.44 --> 2615.2000000000003
like oh okay i don't care i mean the

2612.0 --> 2616.73
marxist goshen trained blacks will be

2615.2 --> 2618.3999999999996
still hated of course

2616.73 --> 2620.16
[Music]

2618.4 --> 2622.48
as long as it's kind of done tasteful

2620.16 --> 2624.3999999999996
you don't act like a disgusting deviant

2622.48 --> 2626.72
or something

2624.4 --> 2628.96
as long as you don't mock

2626.72 --> 2632.0
the negro

2628.96 --> 2635.839
when you wear blackface

2632.0 --> 2635.839
then it's all good by me

2639.44 --> 2646.96
black my [ __ ]

2642.13 --> 2650.079
[Music]

2646.96 --> 2651.119
having white face is the new black

2650.079 --> 2652.48
right

2651.119 --> 2653.6800000000003
yeah

2652.48 --> 2654.88
dude there's

2653.68 --> 2657.2
there's like

2654.88 --> 2660.079
tribes in africa and

2657.2 --> 2662.16
i think even maybe like

2660.079 --> 2664.48
aborigines

2662.16 --> 2667.2
like altar did they they have white

2664.48 --> 2669.359
paint on their face right you see us

2667.2 --> 2671.7599999999998
complaining about it oh cultural

2669.359 --> 2674.56
appropriation they're they're trying to

2671.76 --> 2677.599
mock the whites by putting white paint

2674.56 --> 2681.2
on their black faces how dare they

2677.599 --> 2682.56
how dare you negros put on white face

2681.2 --> 2685.7599999999998
ugh

2682.56 --> 2688.88
you're discriminating against us

2685.76 --> 2691.8390000000004
this is can you imagine that

2688.88 --> 2691.839
it's just silly

2698.72 --> 2704.16
although i think it would probably make

2700.48 --> 2706.96
a pretty funny comedy sketch

2704.16 --> 2706.96
the white man

2707.2 --> 2711.9199999999996
like modern clothing

2709.2 --> 2713.68
going to like an african country to

2711.92 --> 2715.52
visit a tribe

2713.68 --> 2717.44
and then the tribe like perform some

2715.52 --> 2720.48
kind of tradition

2717.44 --> 2723.119
uh dance ritual and like the black guys

2720.48 --> 2724.16
have like white face on

2723.119 --> 2726.7200000000003
and then

2724.16 --> 2730.8799999999997
the white western guy getting all like

2726.72 --> 2730.8799999999997
how dare you that's cultural

2731.2 --> 2734.48
this appropriation

2731.599 --> 2738.7200000000003
an atrocity

2734.48 --> 2738.72
i didn't know you were such racists

2743.04 --> 2746.04
right

2751.76 --> 2755.44
wayne's brothers

2753.76 --> 2757.119
did it in

2755.44 --> 2758.16
movies

2757.119 --> 2760.7200000000003
what

2758.16 --> 2764.44
what did they do

2760.72 --> 2764.4399999999996
put on white face

2775.44 --> 2777.76
huh

2778.72 --> 2783.56
okay

2779.76 --> 2783.5600000000004
i've never seen that

2791.68 --> 2797.359
white chicks a movie that

2794.88 --> 2798.56
this probably is a movie that i would

2797.359 --> 2800.0
never

2798.56 --> 2801.2799999999997
click

2800.0 --> 2804.079
yet

2801.28 --> 2806.48
i think i saw that come by and just like

2804.079 --> 2808.88
the front picture of it in netflix was

2806.48 --> 2812.0
just like ew

2808.88 --> 2813.599
never gonna watch that

2812.0 --> 2816.16
but maybe

2813.599 --> 2818.56
maybe if somebody in their head like a

2816.16 --> 2820.8799999999997
black guy had white face or a white guy

2818.56 --> 2822.72
had black face then i'd be more inclined

2820.88 --> 2825.25
to watch it because then at least it has

2822.72 --> 2828.16
some cultural roots you know

2825.25 --> 2829.68
[Music]

2828.16 --> 2832.56
it's not just

2829.68 --> 2833.5989999999997
modern day trash

2832.56 --> 2836.0
i mean

2833.599 --> 2839.119
having white face or blackface in a

2836.0 --> 2840.96
movie really is like

2839.119 --> 2844.96
it makes it cultural

2840.96 --> 2846.7200000000003
it makes it all better right

2844.96 --> 2848.4
okay now i'm contradicting myself from

2846.72 --> 2849.9199999999996
what i was saying earlier but yeah

2848.4 --> 2853.88
that's what happens when you go with a

2849.92 --> 2853.88
very long running joke

2866.8 --> 2873.2400000000002
white chicks as black man white face

2870.24 --> 2873.24
what

2875.119 --> 2878.119
hmm

2900.559 --> 2905.599
right anyways this has gone on long

2903.28 --> 2905.599
enough

2905.92 --> 2908.16
uh

2908.319 --> 2913.359
right but anyway yeah i have absolutely

2910.48 --> 2915.28
no problem with anybody doing blackface

2913.359 --> 2916.64
ever

2915.28 --> 2919.44
but

2916.64 --> 2922.24
if they happen to be like

2919.44 --> 2924.4
snobbish people that are actually afraid

2922.24 --> 2926.0
of blacks

2924.4 --> 2928.079
it was like oh

2926.0 --> 2930.079
scary black man yeah if you put on that

2928.079 --> 2932.319
face then

2930.079 --> 2936.0
that's not cool

2932.319 --> 2936.0
that doesn't make you cool

2937.44 --> 2940.16
if you're actually scared of black

2939.119 --> 2941.6800000000003
people

2940.16 --> 2945.16
that makes you

2941.68 --> 2945.16
kind of an idiot

2967.44 --> 2970.48
hmm

2968.64 --> 2972.319
who's the guy in the latest nathan

oakley i don't know him this is a new

2974.079 --> 2978.319
you mean the drunk guy

2976.48 --> 2980.64
that was literally admitted they were

2978.319 --> 2982.319
drunk and then

2980.64 --> 2985.04
and then they just started to blabber

2982.319 --> 2987.44
like a complete [ __ ] i don't know who

2985.04 --> 2987.44
he was

2995.44 --> 2999.16
not that one oh

3026.24 --> 3031.3999999999996

girl movies i mean

3051.119 --> 3060.7200000000003
a tough girl was kind of cute you know

3055.599 --> 3062.559
like 30 years ago it's like oh cool

3060.72 --> 3064.72
and then you actually sympathize with

3062.559 --> 3065.6800000000003
them because it is tough being a tough

3064.72 --> 3067.52
woman

3065.68 --> 3070.5589999999997
in a man's world right

3067.52 --> 3073.7599999999998
thing is it's a man's world

3070.559 --> 3073.76
that's how it works

3074.24 --> 3079.2799999999997
you're not gonna change it

can through their own stupid system that

3104.64 --> 3109.359
they're a part of that they're using to

3107.119 --> 3112.319
implement their vision

3109.359 --> 3114.24
of strong women taking over yeah in that

3112.319 --> 3118.24
same system

3114.24 --> 3121.52
men are taking away your golden medals

3118.24 --> 3125.7599999999998
all right men that are supposedly women

3121.52 --> 3128.079
yeah so oh strong woman oh yeah yeah

3125.76 --> 3129.92
you're not helping yourself

3128.079 --> 3132.6400000000003
you're not helping yourself by being

3129.92 --> 3134.8
part of this system

3132.64 --> 3137.5989999999997
that's trying to turn everything into an

3134.8 --> 3139.2000000000003
amazon world

3137.599 --> 3141.3590000000004
it doesn't work it's just going to

3139.2 --> 3143.359
destroy everything

3141.359 --> 3146.72
right you're already

3143.359 --> 3151.119
not getting gold medals anymore

3146.72 --> 3151.1189999999997
because of the system you are part of

3151.28 --> 3155.52
understand strong women hey i like

3153.92 --> 3158.079
strong women

3155.52 --> 3158.96
not necessarily in a relationship

3158.079 --> 3161.8390000000004
but

3158.96 --> 3164.88
i do appreciate that they exist

3161.839 --> 3167.7599999999998
i think they have a place in the world

3164.88 --> 3169.2000000000003
i don't think they should rule us though

3167.76 --> 3170.6400000000003
yeah

3169.2 --> 3171.5989999999997
they shouldn't

3170.64 --> 3173.52
and

3171.599 --> 3175.76
it's already kind of apparent that they

3173.52 --> 3178.24
can't

3175.76 --> 3181.76
because they're not winning any gold

3178.24 --> 3183.2799999999997
medals anymore it's all just men saying

3181.76 --> 3185.599
they're women

3183.28 --> 3187.44
and there's nothing strong women can do

3185.599 --> 3189.92
about it at this point

3187.44 --> 3193.76
yeah because you

3189.92 --> 3195.599
partook in a system to that yeah you

3193.76 --> 3196.559
thought was gonna give you what you

3195.599 --> 3198.8
wanted

3196.559 --> 3200.48
instead it's actually taking it away

3198.8 --> 3204.04
from you

3200.48 --> 3204.04
while you're dreaming

3210.22 --> 3214.5499999999997
[Music]

3217.85 --> 3222.73
[Music]

3223.52 --> 3226.4
you don't think it's real

3230.0 --> 3236.72
i mean there are bigger

3232.48 --> 3239.2
women than 120 pounds clutch

3236.72 --> 3239.2
there are

3240.24 --> 3242.9599999999996
but

3241.92 --> 3246.96
yeah

3242.96 --> 3249.28
and really beefed up man

3246.96 --> 3252.0
it's really tough to beat

3249.28 --> 3253.76
no matter what your build is as a woman

3252.0 --> 3255.839
this is always gonna be they're probably

3253.76 --> 3258.96
always gonna be stronger the peak

3255.839 --> 3263.5589999999997
strength man is just a woman can't

3258.96 --> 3263.559
can't do anything about that

3264.319 --> 3268.68
except user guiles

3288.319 --> 3292.88
why is it the international chess

3290.24 --> 3295.2
championships are divided by sex

3292.88 --> 3295.2000000000003
hmm

3296.799 --> 3302.0
well maybe because

3298.88 --> 3302.0
men are better at it

3305.2 --> 3310.64
i mean why is there

3308.079 --> 3315.2000000000003
international soccer

3310.64 --> 3317.04
championships divided by sex you know

3315.2 --> 3320.04
we all know why

3317.04 --> 3320.04
it's

3336.0 --> 3340.359
okay kevlar that sounds hilarious

3357.839 --> 3364.35
yeah

3359.079 --> 3367.42
pjcnet don't give them any stupid ideas

3364.35 --> 3367.42
[Music]

3374.72 --> 3379.4399999999996
i mean it before you know it they'll ch

3376.96 --> 3381.52
they'll like say oh you can't have white

3379.44 --> 3382.319
and black chess pieces anymore it has to

3381.52 --> 3385.119
be

3382.319 --> 3387.52
purple and yellow now

3385.119 --> 3390.319
right so be careful what you're thinking

3387.52 --> 3393.52
about because they might just do it just

3390.319 --> 3396.88
because you're you're saying it

3393.52 --> 3399.28
and that counts for me as well

3396.88 --> 3402.52
if you come up with it they might just

3399.28 --> 3402.52
do it

3413.0 --> 3416.13
[Music]

3460.48 --> 3463.48
hmm

3482.48 --> 3488.359
what akumu fight really

3485.04 --> 3488.359
that's hilarious

3513.359 --> 3516.68
hey jedo

3522.799 --> 3526.4
okay shadow

3525.359 --> 3529.119
so

3526.4 --> 3532.64
can you tell me what sports

3529.119 --> 3535.359
are women better at than men

3532.64 --> 3535.359
can you tell me

3538.64 --> 3544.0789999999997
or can you name a single one

3542.16 --> 3546.5589999999997
i mean you're being very euphemistic

3544.079 --> 3549.2000000000003
when you say women might not be as good

3546.559 --> 3550.799
as men at certain sports really at

3549.2 --> 3551.68
certain sports

3550.799 --> 3555.28
so

3551.68 --> 3558.24
what sport are they better at

3555.28 --> 3560.799
pole dancing that's that's just that's

3558.24 --> 3563.7599999999998
rude that's just rude

3560.799 --> 3563.7599999999998
that's not a sport

3565.28 --> 3571.96
i mean sexy dancing is not

3568.799 --> 3571.96
a sport

3574.079 --> 3580.319
right and hey even things like ballet

3577.599 --> 3582.88
have men in it

3580.319 --> 3584.319
ice skating has men it like it's kind of

3582.88 --> 3586.559
equal

3584.319 --> 3588.96
right that that's that's probably the

3586.559 --> 3590.6400000000003
best you'll get

3588.96 --> 3592.96
out of it

3590.64 --> 3595.1189999999997
but is there any sports in which women

3592.96 --> 3597.92
are exclusively

3595.119 --> 3601.48
better on average than men i'd like to

3597.92 --> 3601.48
know about it

3602.079 --> 3606.319
oh jedi said activities yeah right yeah

3604.559 --> 3609.559
i'm not talking about acted i'm talking

3606.319 --> 3609.5589999999997
about sports

3627.68 --> 3633.839
what sports are you good at i mean any

3632.079 --> 3635.8390000000004
uh

3633.839 --> 3637.68
i haven't really done any sports in a

3635.839 --> 3639.359
long time

3637.68 --> 3641.9199999999996
i used to be

3639.359 --> 3643.839
kind of decent at football not as not

3641.92 --> 3647.839
any champion or anything but it was i've

3643.839 --> 3649.2
got quick reflexes and that was useful

3647.839 --> 3651.04
also

3649.2 --> 3652.799
i did some

3651.04 --> 3655.7599999999998
taekwondo

3652.799 --> 3658.72
but i mostly did it for balance so i'm

3655.76 --> 3661.8390000000004
probably not super good at like fighting

3658.72 --> 3661.839
sports in general

3662.319 --> 3666.0
so

3663.92 --> 3668.96
let's see

3666.0 --> 3672.0
i just i had a lot of fun doing sports

3668.96 --> 3675.119
it's just that when like other guys got

3672.0 --> 3675.119
really competitive

3675.359 --> 3681.0789999999997
then

3677.28 --> 3681.079
i wasn't the best

3686.96 --> 3692.079
i've done some tennis i've done tablet i

3689.04 --> 3694.799
was really good at table tennis not

3692.079 --> 3696.88
even close to like championship level

3694.799 --> 3700.72
but it was like i could do like fast

3696.88 --> 3702.7200000000003
[ __ ] really fast balls it like if i was

3700.72 --> 3704.9599999999996
in the flow it was typically

3702.72 --> 3706.64
around between the ages of

3704.96 --> 3708.2400000000002
like 10

3706.64 --> 3710.839
and 16.

3708.24 --> 3713.52
i was i was pretty good at table

3710.839 --> 3716.0789999999997
tennis right reflex

3713.52 --> 3717.44
reflex related sports that's where i

3716.079 --> 3719.76
shine

3717.44 --> 3720.88
reflex and balance

3719.76 --> 3723.92
but

3720.88 --> 3726.4
yeah i was never really a sport guy

3723.92 --> 3728.319
i mean i was like enjoyed it but it was

3726.4 --> 3729.02
never like oh man i'm gonna be the best

3728.319 --> 3732.099
at this

3729.02 --> 3732.099
[Music]

3732.16 --> 3737.2799999999997
i reserved that focus on

3735.2 --> 3738.64
mental things

3737.28 --> 3742.4
and

3738.64 --> 3742.4
like the art of description

3748.24 --> 3751.359
a pro gardener

3752.319 --> 3759.68
that's not a sport but yeah

3755.68 --> 3759.68
definitely a worthwhile occupation

3764.079 --> 3769.599
right but yeah we're talking about

3766.559 --> 3772.0
sports right and why men are

3769.599 --> 3775.039
pretty much better at it in everything

3772.0 --> 3778.4
than women doesn't mean that women

3775.039 --> 3780.7990000000004
can't be legends in their own right

3778.4 --> 3783.839
there's women out there that can do just

3780.799 --> 3783.839
incredible work

3798.16 --> 3802.3999999999996
i mean nobody's gonna beat

3800.48 --> 3804.51
women on average when it comes to

3802.4 --> 3806.64
raising little kids you know it

3804.51 --> 3807.92
[Music]

3806.64 --> 3811.1189999999997
like

3807.92 --> 3812.7200000000003
men sometimes like to kind of put that

3811.119 --> 3815.359
in the corner

3812.72 --> 3819.0389999999998
but deep down you know how freaking

3815.359 --> 3821.0389999999998
tough it is to raise little kids

3819.039 --> 3823.44
especially like in the early teens and

3821.039 --> 3823.44
all that

3823.68 --> 3828.16
and women

3825.599 --> 3828.1600000000003
mothers

3828.72 --> 3831.9199999999996
are just better at it

3832.559 --> 3836.28
at handling it

3838.16 --> 3842.0789999999997
although yeah

3839.839 --> 3844.88
a male factor

3842.079 --> 3848.3590000000004
can be also a good influence

3844.88 --> 3848.359
on top of that

3852.319 --> 3856.72
yeah i agree seeking start it's just

3854.319 --> 3856.72
sports

3857.92 --> 3862.7200000000003
it's it's all about peak

3860.64 --> 3864.5589999999997
performance specifically peak

3862.72 --> 3867.4399999999996
performance and

3864.559 --> 3868.48
yeah men are just kind of

3867.44 --> 3872.079
built

3868.48 --> 3874.44
to do that to stand out

3872.079 --> 3876.0
also to draw in women

3874.44 --> 3879.68
[Music]

3876.0 --> 3881.839
to be considered worthy for procreation

3879.68 --> 3881.839
right

3883.039 --> 3890.96
but when it comes to actual survival and

3887.119 --> 3892.1600000000003
non-social ritual related things

3890.96 --> 3895.359
sports are

3892.16 --> 3897.92
really irrelevant

3895.359 --> 3902.16
i mean a sportsman is not guaranteed to

3897.92 --> 3902.16
survive like during a war or something

3905.839 --> 3909.44
being bring home to bacon that's a good

3907.92 --> 3912.44
exercise

3909.44 --> 3912.44
right

3953.119 --> 3957.52
wow

3954.24 --> 3961.359
this has been quite a silly show today

3957.52 --> 3964.559
talking about blackface and

3961.359 --> 3967.92
men versus women's sports

3964.559 --> 3970.0
i guess it's one of those days

3967.92 --> 3972.48
where we're not talking about the core

3970.0 --> 3975.68
esoteric functioning of

3972.48 --> 3978.079
the spirit experience and consciousness

3975.68 --> 3980.48
but instead we're talking about

3978.079 --> 3982.6400000000003
blackface

3980.48 --> 3983.92
and why men are better at sports than

3982.64 --> 3986.8799999999997
women

3983.92 --> 3992.309
and how pointless it is

3986.88 --> 3992.309
[Music]

3992.88 --> 3998.079
you missed the blackface talk it's the

3994.559 --> 3998.079
first half of kumu virus

3999.52 --> 4004.359
i think you'll have a good laugh over it

4001.359 --> 4004.359
too

4017.2 --> 4021.839
all right anyway i'm gonna take a two

4018.559 --> 4021.8390000000004
minute break be right back

4107.839 --> 4111.3189999999995
and i'm back

4130.4 --> 4133.839
yeah i agree borders boy

4159.759 --> 4164.029
huh

4160.939 --> 4164.029
[Music]

4183.44 --> 4185.839
right

4187.12 --> 4194.48
i would like to call this show

4190.359 --> 4196.719
blackfaced or blackface conservative

4194.48 --> 4200.28
but i wonder if i'd get into trouble if

4196.719 --> 4200.28
for doing that

4206.32 --> 4210.3099999999995
maybe i should just not give a [ __ ] and

4208.239 --> 4212.48
do it anyway it's so silly

4210.31 --> 4214.96
[Music]

4212.48 --> 4217.839999999999
but it is kind of a proper title for the

4214.96 --> 4217.84
show

4218.48 --> 4222.54
like what a contrast with the yesterday

4220.64 --> 4229.4890000000005
show title

4222.54 --> 4229.489
[Applause]

4239.84 --> 4245.400000000001
hey goalie mckernan

4241.52 --> 4245.400000000001
i wouldn't call it that

4246.32 --> 4248.799999999999
really

4253.6 --> 4257.280000000001
but i'm not

4255.28 --> 4259.84
i'm just making a joke about it

4257.28 --> 4259.84
basically

4267.52 --> 4273.1990000000005
i'm not even wearing black face on it

4270.56 --> 4275.92
i mean if i had been wearing blackface

4273.199 --> 4279.12
on this show then i get that

4275.92 --> 4282.159
probably get me a strike or something

4279.12 --> 4286.5199999999995
but just talking about it

4282.159 --> 4286.5199999999995
and giving my opinion on it

4295.76 --> 4301.04
call it inappropriate no never

4299.28 --> 4302.08
no black

4301.04 --> 4304.239
face

4302.08 --> 4307.12
is what it is

4304.239 --> 4310.239
i'm not gonna like euphemize it that's

4307.12 --> 4312.0
idiotic that's then they win

4310.239 --> 4313.919999999999
they win

4312.0 --> 4316.64
it's the entire point is that i think

4313.92 --> 4318.8
it's ridiculous that there's this hassle

4316.64 --> 4321.679
concerning blackface

4318.8 --> 4324.0
i think it's preposterous that that's

4321.679 --> 4326.56
happening

4324.0 --> 4329.6
and not letting it go

4326.56 --> 4332.64
so no i am a blackface conservative i

4329.6 --> 4335.120000000001
think it should be conserved

4332.64 --> 4338.08
and shouldn't be put all this nonsense

4335.12 --> 4338.08
weight onto it

4340.88 --> 4343.84
it's [ __ ]

4365.84 --> 4368.84
hmm

4384.32 --> 4388.32
right anyway

4386.08 --> 4389.92
i'm gonna call it blackface conservative

4388.32 --> 4392.08
and yeah

4389.92 --> 4394.08
i don't know man if youtube's gonna say

4392.08 --> 4395.679
er you're gonna have to change that or

4394.08 --> 4398.32
whatever

4395.679 --> 4400.56
fine

4398.32 --> 4400.5599999999995
but

4401.679 --> 4406.56
i just think it's funny

4404.239 --> 4410.4
i don't mean to discriminate i don't

4406.56 --> 4410.400000000001
think it has anything to do with that

4410.48 --> 4413.12
and it's

4411.36 --> 4416.159
stupid

4413.12 --> 4419.5199999999995
marxism [ __ ] programming is trying

4416.159 --> 4421.679
to make it about freaking discrimination

4419.52 --> 4426.64
against race

4421.679 --> 4430.4
like with everything and i say [ __ ] you

4426.64 --> 4433.96
you divide and conquer pieces of [ __ ]

4430.4 --> 4437.5199999999995
why don't you [ __ ] off with your filthy

4433.96 --> 4441.2390000000005
discrimination implanted mind control

4437.52 --> 4441.2390000000005
just [ __ ] off

4471.36 --> 4476.08
yeah i know borders boy yeah it's very

4473.44 --> 4480.36
annoying that's why i shouldn't watch tv

4476.08 --> 4480.36
adverts because they suck

4498.96 --> 4502.32
correct pjc net

4500.88 --> 4504.4800000000005
it is what they are doing it's the

4502.32 --> 4505.759999999999
fighting conquer and i'm not taking part

4504.48 --> 4508.5599999999995
of it

4505.76 --> 4510.96
and in order to not take part of it

4508.56 --> 4513.92
i must help conserve

4510.96 --> 4513.92
the traditions

4514.0 --> 4518.56
that are being targeted

4516.719 --> 4520.719
so that's why i'm a blackface

4518.56 --> 4522.88
conservative even though i'm not wearing

4520.719 --> 4525.44
blackface i don't have a particular

4522.88 --> 4528.56

4525.44 --> 4529.839999999999
want it to stop being attacked just let

4528.56 --> 4532.8
it go

4529.84 --> 4535.679

4532.8 --> 4536.88
if they want it and just stop

4535.679 --> 4539.12
whining

4536.88 --> 4540.400000000001
