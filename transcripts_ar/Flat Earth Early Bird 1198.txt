103.6 --> 108.72
that will move that would be much

105.92 --> 108.72
appreciated

108.88 --> 113.88
so

110.56 --> 113.88
whether today

114.079 --> 117.119
again quite beautiful

126.64 --> 131.2
although it didn't really start out like

128.959 --> 133.28
that

131.2 --> 136.07999999999998
when i first woke up it was like

133.28 --> 140.0
actually really cloudy and misty

136.08 --> 140.0
like actual mist out there but

140.64 --> 145.51999999999998
yeah later on

143.2 --> 148.23899999999998
in the morning it cleared up again

145.52 --> 151.04000000000002
so yeah it's another

148.239 --> 153.76
beautiful clear

151.04 --> 158.16
spring day

153.76 --> 160.72
very similar to summer except less warm

158.16 --> 164.2
planes flying up there not really

160.72 --> 164.2
leaving trails

172.64 --> 175.44
i'm really wondering by the way when

174.64 --> 177.2
these

175.44 --> 178.879
trees right in front here are going to

177.2 --> 181.04
bloom remember those are like pink

178.879 --> 183.35999999999999
blossom trees

181.04 --> 186.239
because there are some pink blossom

183.36 --> 189.12
trees around already blooming

186.239 --> 191.36
and well especially the white ones

189.12 --> 194.48000000000002
they all bloom first

191.36 --> 196.87900000000002
yeah like behind that tree

194.48 --> 199.92
right next

196.879 --> 201.44
to the other building in the distance

199.92 --> 202.879
but these ones

201.44 --> 204.879
yeah i haven't given any sign of

202.879 --> 207.28
blossoming just yet so i wonder when

204.879 --> 210.72
they will

207.28 --> 210.72
it's always quite a spectacle

210.879 --> 215.04
right

212.56 --> 215.04
anyway

220.64 --> 225.48
hello em first in chat

228.4 --> 233.12
so time is

230.64 --> 236.159
resynchronized between europe and

233.12 --> 236.159
the united states

237.68 --> 241.68
i hope everybody is noticing that

239.84 --> 243.439
otherwise a lot of people that are just

241.68 --> 246.48000000000002
got used to that everything is an hour

243.439 --> 248.879
later they yeah they're all late or they

246.48 --> 251.879
might be

248.879 --> 251.879
right

254.08 --> 256.72
anyway

257.12 --> 263.16
it is the 28th

259.359 --> 263.15999999999997
of march 2022.

265.52 --> 270.56
huh

266.4 --> 270.56
even like decently on time

271.6 --> 275.08000000000004
how about that

282.56 --> 284.88
right

283.44 --> 287.52
so

284.88 --> 290.24
what have i been doing

287.52 --> 290.24
yesterday

292.0 --> 295.0
uh

298.88 --> 301.44
what uh

301.919 --> 306.08
i just noticed michael khan uploaded a

304.4 --> 310.84
video

306.08 --> 310.84
looks like it's alex steen in there

316.0 --> 321.12
what

317.44 --> 322.88
damn alex dean got on taco tucker cars

321.12 --> 325.84000000000003
carlson

322.88 --> 325.84
damn bro

342.0 --> 344.639
right

342.96 --> 347.12
yeah that's not what i've been watching

344.639 --> 348.24
i just noticed that that was just

347.12 --> 351.24
uploaded

348.24 --> 351.24
uh

353.759 --> 357.84000000000003
uh oh yeah

355.68 --> 360.56
sleeping warrior had another video it's

357.84 --> 360.56
been a while

365.12 --> 371.28000000000003
about specular reflections of the ocean

369.12 --> 374.24
and how flat earth math supposedly

371.28 --> 375.52
demonstrated oh look see

374.24 --> 378.08
see this is

375.52 --> 379.75899999999996
this is normal and yeah it didn't look

378.08 --> 382.4
like

379.759 --> 384.72
sun reflecting off the ocean at all

382.4 --> 388.08
in this demonstration

384.72 --> 388.08000000000004
so that was kind of hilarious

389.039 --> 392.84
especially the excuses some of these

391.039 --> 395.68
anti-flat earther

392.84 --> 399.35999999999996
numpties responded with

395.68 --> 399.36
in the comment that i left

400.16 --> 407.6
the ocean has waves the surface is not

403.44 --> 410.0
smooth like a mirror oh yes of course

407.6 --> 412.40000000000003
that's why it doesn't look

410.0 --> 414.639
like the sun reflecting off the ocean at

412.4 --> 414.63899999999995
all

415.36 --> 420.319
like a beam it's because of waves it's

418.16 --> 423.84000000000003
because the water is not smooth that's

420.319 --> 426.47900000000004
why it looks like it's a beam

423.84 --> 428.96
reflected off the ocean instead of a

426.479 --> 432.639
spotlight which would is what you would

428.96 --> 433.75899999999996
see as a specular reflection of a ball

432.639 --> 437.0
right

433.759 --> 437.0
of course

443.84 --> 448.84
c can be in many states so your comment

446.72 --> 452.8
means nothing

448.84 --> 452.79999999999995
yes oh yes

454.16 --> 456.56
anyway

457.68 --> 462.319
hey mike sudanic good to see you

460.479 --> 466.8
you saw my comment uh you got the

462.319 --> 466.8
notification from tony

468.96 --> 472.08
right so what else

476.72 --> 481.52000000000004
oh yeah

478.639 --> 485.36
i got on kent hovind's chat while he was

481.52 --> 488.71999999999997
live he was talking about jehovah's

485.36 --> 490.639
and i i literally dropped my question in

488.72 --> 492.56
the chat there

490.639 --> 494.879
that i asked here on this show a while

492.56 --> 494.879
ago

494.96 --> 497.75899999999996
a couple of days ago

496.879 --> 500.72
about

497.759 --> 502.72
adam and eve's height

500.72 --> 504.96000000000004
so i literally in the chat there was

502.72 --> 507.36
like oh you're all christians right your

504.96 --> 509.35999999999996
biblical studied people

507.36 --> 512.32
i got a question

509.36 --> 515.12
can you give me a specific height

512.32 --> 518.08
of adam and eve is there any scripture

515.12 --> 521.2
that mentions that

518.08 --> 523.599
and yeah i didn't get a response there

521.2 --> 523.599
either

523.839 --> 527.9200000000001
that somebody actually told me

525.6 --> 530.8000000000001
specifically like no

527.92 --> 533.1999999999999
can't seem to find one

530.8 --> 535.92
so that was interesting so it's good to

533.2 --> 539.279
test your ideas further beyond your own

535.92 --> 539.279
personal platform you know

541.36 --> 545.12
and i am kind of glad that kent hoffman

543.6 --> 547.9200000000001
like doesn't

545.12 --> 550.24
like typically block flat earthers just

547.92 --> 552.8
because they're flat earthers

550.24 --> 557.5600000000001
so that's nice

552.8 --> 557.56
it's a good place to ask such questions

569.36 --> 574.32
oh yeah that that video uploaded from

571.92 --> 575.68
yesterday how do you make chowski

574.32 --> 579.44
it's kind of a personal update

575.68 --> 581.12
apparently he broke his laptop literally

579.44 --> 583.2
he had it laying on the edge of the

581.12 --> 585.68
balcony and then it fell off and

583.2 --> 587.0400000000001
literally broke

585.68 --> 588.3199999999999
so

587.04 --> 591.12
that happened

588.32 --> 595.0400000000001
apparently to him

591.12 --> 595.04
he's been very distracted

597.92 --> 604.68
so he says

599.92 --> 604.68
right so that's pretty much it

610.0 --> 612.88
let's see

611.76 --> 615.12
i've been

612.88 --> 619.48
don't think i've been watching netflix i

615.12 --> 619.48
went to bed pretty early too

621.68 --> 627.12
nice to see sleeping warrior put putting

624.079 --> 627.12
up a good video

628.72 --> 633.36
yeah it's been a while

630.959 --> 635.279
although he's still active with us at

633.36 --> 637.2
the flat earth debates and all that but

635.279 --> 639.68
he hasn't really done a lot of videos

637.2 --> 639.6800000000001
recently

640.56 --> 645.56
but yeah it comes comes and goes

650.32 --> 653.32
another

663.68 --> 667.8389999999999
right

665.68 --> 671.12
so yeah i what i did actually watch back

667.839 --> 672.8000000000001
my own show yesterday

671.12 --> 676.32
and it

672.8 --> 678.7199999999999
it really stood out to me again

676.32 --> 681.44
how much

678.72 --> 682.72
in the experience of the moment it seems

681.44 --> 684.9590000000001
like i'm like

682.72 --> 687.5600000000001
waiting a lot

684.959 --> 690.3199999999999
that there's like these

687.56 --> 692.16
insurmountable pauses in between

690.32 --> 694.32
everything

692.16 --> 696.88
but in reality

694.32 --> 699.12
when i watch it back it turns out that

696.88 --> 703.8389999999999
those pulses don't actually last that

699.12 --> 703.839
long and it adds up to kind of fluid

704.959 --> 708.3199999999999
so yeah that that was

709.04 --> 714.16
noteworthy insight from my part

714.8 --> 718.639
hey tony whitcomb good to see you

722.639 --> 725.9590000000001
jeff gassett

733.68 --> 738.16
oh you got good weather too good good to

735.92 --> 738.16
hear

740.16 --> 745.8389999999999
i don't got any gusto energy during

742.48 --> 745.839
today but

746.56 --> 750.3199999999999
i do have a bit of grapefruit juice

751.76 --> 757.24
which i'm saving up to later in the show

777.2 --> 782.639
yeah so how was your sunday

780.399 --> 786.68
is there anything interesting

782.639 --> 786.6800000000001
that i've missed out on

788.399 --> 797.32
i should hear about a slow mo moon buggy

792.639 --> 797.32
winter return to your area what

800.959 --> 805.68
how did that happen

803.44 --> 805.6800000000001
oh

806.959 --> 811.1999999999999
yep it's the jackdaw taking a bath

813.36 --> 816.639
super let's

814.72 --> 818.5600000000001
let me show you if my camera doesn't

816.639 --> 820.5600000000001
freaking freeze up

818.56 --> 823.56
yep it just froze up

820.56 --> 823.56
brilliant

840.959 --> 845.7199999999999
if we can get a um angle yeah

858.88 --> 861.88
huh

872.0 --> 876.56
they're always like really enjoying it

873.839 --> 876.5600000000001
when they're doing it

879.44 --> 884.48
but i mean it is pretty good bath water

881.92 --> 886.399
i do like include a little salt in it

884.48 --> 890.639
too

886.399 --> 894.88
some himalayan sea salt extra minerals

890.639 --> 894.88
which is good for them to drink too but

895.76 --> 900.16
it would make better bathing water to

897.76 --> 903.8389999999999
damn he's like

900.16 --> 903.8389999999999
he's exhausted the entire thing

908.16 --> 913.48
okay now the camera's probably going to

910.0 --> 913.48
freeze up again

914.0 --> 916.24
see

922.08 --> 925.129
[Music]

931.519 --> 934.519
right

944.16 --> 949.4399999999999
everyone's checking their usb ports

946.72 --> 952.5600000000001
yeah i think that those usb ports are

949.44 --> 954.32
getting kind of old maybe they

952.56 --> 956.399
need some kind of a cleaning or

954.32 --> 959.1990000000001
something

956.399 --> 960.56
it's not like i totally abused

959.199 --> 962.8
those ports

960.56 --> 963.7589999999999
with like ripping cables out of them or

962.8 --> 965.5999999999999
something

963.759 --> 967.44
it's just that

965.6 --> 969.759
for some reason it's become a little

967.44 --> 971.839
sensitive

969.759 --> 973.6800000000001
annoying

971.839 --> 978.0790000000001
but yeah it is part it's like not the

973.68 --> 978.079
motherboard it's part of yeah it's the

978.32 --> 984.399
it's the box

981.12 --> 987.6
the usb ports are part of the

984.399 --> 987.6
the tower so

987.759 --> 993.0790000000001
a seeking star water let's see you

990.079 --> 993.079
youtube

1009.6 --> 1013.1990000000001
oh

1010.48 --> 1014.5600000000001
wow that sounds spectacular singing star

1013.199 --> 1016.959
wars

1014.56 --> 1016.959
awesome

1017.759 --> 1022.839
is it actually called flat head valley

1024.48 --> 1026.72
hmm

1028.959 --> 1032.0
hey geoshifter

1033.28 --> 1039.079
by pci card with new usb ports

1046.079 --> 1048.559
i guess

1047.76 --> 1051.36
that

1048.559 --> 1052.8799999999999
that is a possibility that's interesting

1051.36 --> 1056.08
geoshifter i've never even thought of

1052.88 --> 1060.0
that i could do that i guess

1056.08 --> 1061.1999999999998
i'm gonna have to like buy it though

1060.0 --> 1062.96
i mean

1061.2 --> 1065.28
i mean the setup still kind of working

1062.96 --> 1067.52
right i just have to like deactivate

1065.28 --> 1069.52
reactivate

1067.52 --> 1073.2
sometimes

1069.52 --> 1076.32
like both with my mic and my camera but

1073.2 --> 1079.96
like as long as i pay attention then

1076.32 --> 1079.96
it's still tenable

1083.28 --> 1088.6399999999999
brian cox is doing a show in your town

1085.44 --> 1088.64
24th of april

1129.44 --> 1132.88
like

1131.12 --> 1135.6789999999999
you know i'm going with the consensus

1132.88 --> 1138.64
science doesn't prove anything then then

1135.679 --> 1140.5590000000002
i'd absolutely say okay dude

1138.64 --> 1143.2
check this out

1140.559 --> 1145.039
nathan oakley9080

1143.2 --> 1146.559
you gotta watch this

1145.039 --> 1149.6
i do that

1146.559 --> 1152.559
i do that specifically like that

1149.6 --> 1156.24
that would be amazing

1152.559 --> 1158.72
talked about the flyers if you oh he did

1156.24 --> 1159.679
oh i completely missed about um i missed

1158.72 --> 1162.96
that

1159.679 --> 1162.96
i didn't know he had flyers

1163.2 --> 1166.919
i want some of those

1180.0 --> 1185.28
how fast would brian cox

1182.4 --> 1187.679
use a fallacy if he went on nathan's

1185.28 --> 1189.2
well he did went on nathan's youtube did

1187.679 --> 1191.679
you not know

1189.2 --> 1194.32
he did actually go on nathan's

1191.679 --> 1194.3200000000002
years ago

1196.48 --> 1199.6
and

1198.24 --> 1201.52
well he

1199.6 --> 1204.48
he didn't like went

1201.52 --> 1208.559
full anti-flat earther on us i was there

1204.48 --> 1210.559
when it happened he actually

1208.559 --> 1213.36
just was kind of honest

1210.559 --> 1214.72
he was just being honest

1213.36 --> 1218.32
and

1214.72 --> 1221.1200000000001
ended up admitting like yeah we just

1218.32 --> 1223.039
used the standard

1221.12 --> 1225.52
the standard information

1223.039 --> 1228.1589999999999
that was like yes i'm a good boy i'm

1225.52 --> 1230.6399999999999
just doing what we're told to be to do

1228.159 --> 1232.48
that's basically his position that

1230.64 --> 1234.48
that's what he ended up with

1232.48 --> 1236.64
which is like more than

1234.48 --> 1238.4
yeah you'd expect from any anti-flat

1236.64 --> 1241.919
earther that we've bumped into he was

1238.4 --> 1241.919
actually kind of honest about it

1246.88 --> 1250.5590000000002
oh mick west

1249.039 --> 1252.4
oh yeah yeah

1250.559 --> 1254.799
oh yeah i might have mixed them up make

1252.4 --> 1257.1200000000001
west yeah it was mick west

1254.799 --> 1258.24
not brian cox

1257.12 --> 1261.9599999999998
but i

1258.24 --> 1261.96
they're very similar

1264.48 --> 1269.52
i think i even look alike a bit let me

1268.159 --> 1273.23
compare that

1269.52 --> 1273.23
[Applause]

1274.64 --> 1278.24
british science writer

1280.159 --> 1283.44
nick west and

1284.4 --> 1288.6000000000001
brian

1285.6 --> 1288.6
cox

1293.039 --> 1298.24
yeah they they do look a bit similar

1296.48 --> 1300.72
not completely

1298.24 --> 1302.48
they have sort of the same face shape

1300.72 --> 1306.559
yeah yeah no they're not the same person

1302.48 --> 1306.559
you're right i mixed them up

1307.84 --> 1311.6789999999999
hey nathan oakley 1980 good to see you

1316.159 --> 1322.3200000000002
yeah no i guess you're right no i i in

1319.44 --> 1324.4
my mind i merged them to one person for

1322.32 --> 1329.32
some reason

1324.4 --> 1329.3200000000002
got mandela affected again i guess

1334.799 --> 1338.44
hey terra 306

1347.039 --> 1354.52
make west made thps1

1350.64 --> 1354.5200000000002
i don't know what that is

1372.72 --> 1377.76
oh it's a computer game

1374.4 --> 1380.3200000000002
okay youtube i have no idea

1377.76 --> 1381.28
tony hawk's pro skater what

1380.32 --> 1384.8799999999999
oh

1381.28 --> 1388.9189999999999
okay okay i got it i got it youtube

1384.88 --> 1388.919
don't have to post it twice

1400.0 --> 1404.96
yeah and terror 306 the

1402.559 --> 1409.84
the time has changed again

1404.96 --> 1409.8400000000001
right so i'm yes i'm earlier because

1410.0 --> 1414.0
in europe we switched to summer time

1412.799 --> 1417.48
like

1414.0 --> 1417.48
i think yesterday

1419.039 --> 1424.2
that's when i started to notice the time

1421.2 --> 1424.2
difference

1432.48 --> 1435.48
um

1444.159 --> 1448.88
you played those games a lot okay

1447.36 --> 1453.279
yeah i didn't

1448.88 --> 1453.279
i was not interested at all

1454.159 --> 1458.72
i've never really liked

1456.96 --> 1461.6000000000001
like sort of

1458.72 --> 1461.6000000000001
third-person

1462.0 --> 1465.76
sports games i always thought like this

1464.559 --> 1469.6
is like

1465.76 --> 1471.679
just such a waste of time it's just

1469.6 --> 1474.0
i mean you

1471.679 --> 1477.52
it's better to just like

1474.0 --> 1479.52
actually do something physically instead

1477.52 --> 1482.76
so i've never been fan of sports games

1479.52 --> 1482.76
at all

1493.2 --> 1496.2
so

1513.84 --> 1516.48
okay youtube

1515.279 --> 1518.0
it's

1516.48 --> 1520.96
what happens when you play too many

1518.0 --> 1523.36
video games like everything becomes the

1520.96 --> 1526.32
video game i know all about it

1523.36 --> 1529.84
i played quite a few

1526.32 --> 1529.84
ghouls and ghosts

1529.919 --> 1533.679
and then just

1531.44 --> 1536.559
basically at the time

1533.679 --> 1538.5590000000002
i actually started to collect sticks

1536.559 --> 1540.3999999999999
to throw at things

1538.559 --> 1543.36
because i thought they were ghosts not

1540.4 --> 1545.6000000000001
literally i imagine that they were

1543.36 --> 1548.3999999999999
just like throw sticks

1545.6 --> 1550.799
like spears in the game

1548.4 --> 1553.6000000000001
when you play video games a lot then

1550.799 --> 1557.559
everything becomes the video game

1553.6 --> 1557.559
i know all about that

1558.64 --> 1560.96
all right

1566.4 --> 1571.52
imagine you'd play stuff like tort yeah

1569.36 --> 1574.0
yeah i did actually play torchlight one

1571.52 --> 1575.039
and two

1574.0 --> 1576.559
it was

1575.039 --> 1580.32
it was okay

1576.559 --> 1580.32
didn't really like the graphics

1580.96 --> 1583.8400000000001
but yeah

1582.799 --> 1587.2
i like

1583.84 --> 1589.6
diablo 2 more it was just more beautiful

1587.2 --> 1591.52
and i like the music a lot better

1589.6 --> 1594.48
right remember for me

1591.52 --> 1596.96
music in a game is really everything if

1594.48 --> 1599.52
the game doesn't have good music

1596.96 --> 1601.8400000000001
it's not gonna last as long

1599.52 --> 1603.76
unless it just happens to really be a

1601.84 --> 1607.36
good well-balanced game and then i'll

1603.76 --> 1609.52
probably just turn the music off

1607.36 --> 1613.32
but yeah back in the past you didn't

1609.52 --> 1613.32
always have that luxury

1613.44 --> 1618.24
so if the music sucked then the game

1615.919 --> 1619.44
sucked

1618.24 --> 1622.24
and yeah

1619.44 --> 1624.3200000000002
music was good then i just put it on

1622.24 --> 1627.48
pause and listen to the music a lot of

1624.32 --> 1627.48
the time

1640.48 --> 1647.44
do you need voice actors for your game

1644.159 --> 1647.44
what you're making a game

1651.76 --> 1655.84
what kind of game gshf there

1683.6 --> 1688.48
oh horror first person shooter combined

1686.559 --> 1691.2
okay

1688.48 --> 1694.2
unreal engine all right

1691.2 --> 1694.2
huh

1714.88 --> 1719.8400000000001
well if you need any funny voices or

1717.12 --> 1721.9189999999999
like a really creepy voices

1719.84 --> 1725.52
perhaps

1721.919 --> 1728.0800000000002
i'd help you out

1725.52 --> 1730.32
you know i i can do a pretty sweet

1728.08 --> 1732.8799999999999
golem for example

1730.32 --> 1735.2
well it's not the only crazy voice i can

1732.88 --> 1738.3200000000002
do and i can literally just conjure

1735.2 --> 1741.279
something up

1738.32 --> 1741.279
if necessary

1741.84 --> 1746.399
right i'm mostly used to just doing

1744.0 --> 1748.24
voices live every time

1746.399 --> 1750.08
that's how i do things but yeah if it's

1748.24 --> 1751.76
going to be like a pre-recorded thing

1750.08 --> 1754.24
then i can have a little bit more

1751.76 --> 1754.24
practice

1754.399 --> 1759.7199999999998
oh pay two oh that second yes

1771.44 --> 1775.76
just don't turn me into some kind of

1773.279 --> 1777.919
exposition guy because my voice is

1775.76 --> 1781.84
probably not

1777.919 --> 1781.8400000000001
compelling enough for that

1791.44 --> 1796.0800000000002
nathan can help implement tea bagging

1793.679 --> 1796.0800000000002
system

1799.36 --> 1804.32
dude there should be like a tea bagging

1801.44 --> 1806.799
hack animation everywhere

1804.32 --> 1809.84
or if somebody actually

1806.799 --> 1813.039
that automatically the the graphics

1809.84 --> 1815.279
if somebody chooses to tea bag

1813.039 --> 1817.36
to crouch on top of a

1815.279 --> 1819.84
an in-game corpse

1817.36 --> 1821.039
that automatically an animation becomes

1819.84 --> 1822.6399999999999
summoned

1821.039 --> 1825.52
right

1822.64 --> 1827.3600000000001
of a of a ball earth

1825.52 --> 1830.36
being squashed by a flat earth or

1827.36 --> 1830.36
something

1852.559 --> 1855.84
you get banned in many servers if you

1854.799 --> 1858.799
really

1855.84 --> 1858.799
they do that now

1859.039 --> 1861.36
wow

1862.399 --> 1866.7199999999998
that's

1863.6 --> 1868.48
really sad

1866.72 --> 1872.3990000000001
i mean

1868.48 --> 1872.3990000000001
it's a video game

1874.48 --> 1877.64
the [ __ ]

1897.44 --> 1902.159
all right geo shifter cool keep us

1899.6 --> 1902.1589999999999
updated

1903.279 --> 1907.44
and yeah

1904.64 --> 1909.76
if you need anything you know where you

1907.44 --> 1912.0
can find me through skype

1909.76 --> 1912.0
right

1915.919 --> 1920.159
i'm afraid my recording equipment is not

1918.64 --> 1923.44
exactly

1920.159 --> 1927.96
high quality grade but

1923.44 --> 1927.96
hopefully we can work something out

1958.64 --> 1962.72
the most horrible game like ever

1961.039 --> 1964.72
well youtube there's games out there

1962.72 --> 1967.919
that are so [ __ ] up i'm not even gonna

1964.72 --> 1967.919
tell you what they are

1971.36 --> 1973.76
so

1972.24 --> 1976.64
yeah but i

1973.76 --> 1978.8799999999999
like that that later wolfenstein game

1976.64 --> 1980.7990000000002
because there was an earlier wolfenstein

1978.88 --> 1982.88
game

1980.799 --> 1984.96
which is just a combat game and i

1982.88 --> 1986.3200000000002
thought that game was actually really

1984.96 --> 1988.64
good

1986.32 --> 1991.4399999999998
or it seemed very good for a while and i

1988.64 --> 1993.76
really liked like the voice

1991.44 --> 1996.64
communication options that were in that

1993.76 --> 1998.8799999999999
game i really liked it

1996.64 --> 2001.679
because you could on the fly

1998.88 --> 2003.919
strategize with your fellow players

2001.679 --> 2006.24
through not through chat but through

2003.919 --> 2007.3600000000001
like voice prompts and it worked really

2006.24 --> 2009.36
well

2007.36 --> 2012.24
i like that

2009.36 --> 2014.9599999999998
but i saw i think i remember that there

2012.24 --> 2017.039
was an update to like a later version

2014.96 --> 2019.279
that was much more gruesome and

2017.039 --> 2023.519
sci-fi-ish

2019.279 --> 2023.519
i was not really interested in that one

2023.6 --> 2027.9599999999998
i guess it was super gory

2033.44 --> 2037.0800000000002
all right anyway

2055.679 --> 2061.599
okay youtube let's not talk about those

2058.56 --> 2063.7599999999998
video games how about that

2061.599 --> 2065.839
yeah i don't want to be i want don't

2063.76 --> 2068.32
want this show to be about freaking

2065.839 --> 2069.52
video games you got it it's about flat

2068.32 --> 2071.52
earth here

2069.52 --> 2073.04
talk about flat earth about the world

2071.52 --> 2075.28
about

2073.04 --> 2077.839
spiritual mechanics

2075.28 --> 2078.5600000000004
fractal thinking

2077.839 --> 2083.2
and

2078.56 --> 2086.0789999999997
super far out of the box unconventional

2083.2 --> 2086.839
conceptual mechanics

2086.079 --> 2090.32
not

2086.839 --> 2092.48
gross gruesome video games

2090.32 --> 2093.52
i mean i'd love to help geo-shifter with

2092.48 --> 2095.04
his

2093.52 --> 2096.879
maybe

2095.04 --> 2098.96
i don't want to talk about that stuff

2096.879 --> 2101.04
all day yeah because i'm not a fan of

2098.96 --> 2102.88
that

2101.04 --> 2105.839
and

2102.88 --> 2108.079
i don't really care for that stuff

2105.839 --> 2110.4
personally like if geoshifter had that

2108.079 --> 2113.119
game i'd be like whoa that's cool man

2110.4 --> 2114.56
that's pretty impressive i i won't play

2113.119 --> 2117.8
the game

2114.56 --> 2117.7999999999997
i won't

2118.0 --> 2123.28
maybe like a sneak peek just to see like

2120.72 --> 2125.1189999999997
how he got it to work or something

2123.28 --> 2127.76
to see how good it is i'm not gonna play

2125.119 --> 2127.76
the game though

2128.4 --> 2133.599
because i don't like that type of game i

2131.04 --> 2136.16
never did i never liked the horror

2133.599 --> 2137.839
thriller genre especially like sneaking

2136.16 --> 2141.72
around and

2137.839 --> 2141.72
oh too scary

2157.119 --> 2160.079
shacked out

2161.599 --> 2164.7200000000003
hey flatter sage

2168.72 --> 2173.9199999999996
you're all shagged out what you've been

2170.8 --> 2177.48
watching too much flat earth porn

2173.92 --> 2177.48
i don't get it

2200.32 --> 2205.04
i think atomic bombs are faked is there

2202.56 --> 2208.64
any proof

2205.04 --> 2211.52
there's a lot of proof they're faked

2208.64 --> 2211.52
on the other hand

2213.04 --> 2217.119
does it really matter at this point

2218.0 --> 2224.96
i'm i'm satisfied there are pretty

2222.16 --> 2227.359
heavy weapons already and

2224.96 --> 2231.119
there is already evidence enough that

2227.359 --> 2232.0
entire cities have been leveled

2231.119 --> 2234.079
right

2232.0 --> 2236.88
you don't need an atomic bomb for that

2234.079 --> 2239.6800000000003
so it's like oh no

2236.88 --> 2243.839
yeah yeah this the whole place could

2239.68 --> 2243.839
potentially still be blown up

2244.079 --> 2248.32
right

2245.44 --> 2250.8
isn't that what it's all about

2248.32 --> 2254.1600000000003
i mean does it have to be

2250.8 --> 2255.2000000000003
atomic fission explosion or can it just

2254.16 --> 2259.7599999999998
be

2255.2 --> 2262.0789999999997
like napalm carpet bombing you know

2259.76 --> 2264.1600000000003
i don't necessarily think one is worse

2262.079 --> 2267.88
than the other

2264.16 --> 2267.8799999999997
if you know what i mean

2276.56 --> 2282.0
also what could very well be is if there

2279.2 --> 2284.24
is a a button event

2282.0 --> 2286.72
and missile start flying that it won't

2284.24 --> 2290.7999999999997
actually turn out to be

2286.72 --> 2293.5989999999997
giant crater explosions

2290.8 --> 2297.52
but that it will simply destroy all

2293.599 --> 2298.96
electronics in miles and miles of radius

2297.52 --> 2302.16
right

2298.96 --> 2304.32
guess what's going to happen after that

2302.16 --> 2307.359
right because that includes electronics

2304.32 --> 2310.0
that has temperature control and

2307.359 --> 2310.0
everything

2310.16 --> 2315.2799999999997
all communication

2312.96 --> 2315.28
yeah

2315.839 --> 2318.0
so

2317.2 --> 2320.7999999999997
like

2318.0 --> 2323.119
atom bombs it literally doesn't matter

2320.8 --> 2326.119
whether they exist or not for what could

2323.119 --> 2326.119
happen

2328.079 --> 2332.4
because you can bet your bottom dollar

2330.72 --> 2336.3199999999997
or ruble

2332.4 --> 2338.8
that if missiles are gonna fly

2336.32 --> 2341.839
they're gonna screw everything up

2338.8 --> 2341.8390000000004
big time

2348.16 --> 2353.2799999999997
oh are you no don't know how to yeah

2350.96 --> 2355.119
it's called fire bombing pep mix you

2353.28 --> 2357.3590000000004
[ __ ] [ __ ]

2355.119 --> 2361.52
your little [ __ ]

2357.359 --> 2363.839
firebombing like the rest of japan that

2361.52 --> 2366.88
was firebombed

2363.839 --> 2370.56
and of which the literal result of like

2366.88 --> 2371.76
the scorch cities looked exactly the

2370.56 --> 2372.96
same

2371.76 --> 2375.599
numpty

2372.96 --> 2378.56
it's the same it's firebombing

2375.599 --> 2380.96
yeah then you take special little two

2378.56 --> 2382.4
little bombs angled in a certain way

2380.96 --> 2383.68
filmed in a

2382.4 --> 2386.079
certain way and then oh you got a

2383.68 --> 2389.2
mushroom cloud oh so now it's an atom

2386.079 --> 2393.76
bomb yeah it was fire bombing just like

2389.2 --> 2396.7599999999998
the rest of japan pep mix

2393.76 --> 2396.76
[ __ ]

2417.92 --> 2421.96
right just like dresden

2430.24 --> 2432.4799999999996
yeah

2433.04 --> 2437.68
that's right shops open up people

2435.359 --> 2441.119
walking the streets it's gross it's

2437.68 --> 2441.1189999999997
scorched it's [ __ ] up

2443.28 --> 2448.48
probably smells like bacon everywhere

2446.24 --> 2450.56
bacon and napalm or what whatever the

2448.48 --> 2452.56
exact substances that they use in the

2450.56 --> 2453.839
fire bombs but it must be something like

2452.56 --> 2454.96
that

2453.839 --> 2457.44
yeah

2454.96 --> 2460.64
but there's no fallout

2457.44 --> 2463.599
fallout is fiction

2460.64 --> 2464.8799999999997
it doesn't exist

2463.599 --> 2467.3590000000004
yeah

2464.88 --> 2468.96
that's also why

2467.359 --> 2472.88
fukushima's

2468.96 --> 2475.599
direct environment is absolutely fine

2472.88 --> 2475.599
and that's why

2475.68 --> 2482.319
chernobyl's direct environment is

2478.96 --> 2485.04
actually flourishing the nature there is

2482.319 --> 2488.0
flourishing yeah yeah yeah because there

2485.04 --> 2492.56
is no radioactive fallout

2488.0 --> 2495.119
because nuclear explosions don't exist

2492.56 --> 2496.16
they're fiction

2495.119 --> 2499.44
yeah

2496.16 --> 2502.56
their oppenheimer mind control that's

2499.44 --> 2506.4
what they are people died

2502.56 --> 2508.72
in order to reinforce that mind control

2506.4 --> 2510.599
yeah people that caught it at the time

2508.72 --> 2513.48
that this is fixed they were

2510.599 --> 2516.6400000000003
assassinated you hear me they were

2513.48 --> 2518.72
assassinated for speaking out how atom

2516.64 --> 2522.7999999999997
bombs were a psyop

2518.72 --> 2524.0789999999997
people americans were assassinated

2522.8 --> 2526.7200000000003
yeah

2524.079 --> 2529.44
because it's a psyop because it isn't

2526.72 --> 2532.0789999999997
real and they couldn't allow the people

2529.44 --> 2535.2000000000003
at the time to see through that because

2532.079 --> 2537.92
it was a really big maneuver it was a

2535.2 --> 2540.64
big geopolitical maneuver that would

2537.92 --> 2542.319
change the game forever

2540.64 --> 2545.04
yeah

2542.319 --> 2546.079
that's what it was it wasn't an atom

2545.04 --> 2548.839
bomb

2546.079 --> 2551.92
it was a psyop

2548.839 --> 2554.72
firebombing photo up with that a couple

2551.92 --> 2557.04
of really impressive animations like

2554.72 --> 2559.9199999999996
claymation giant explosions with the

2557.04 --> 2563.68
camera just not even moving or vibrating

2559.92 --> 2565.52
from the atomic explosion it's in yeah

2563.68 --> 2567.839
it's fake

2565.52 --> 2571.079
it's all fake

2567.839 --> 2571.0789999999997
pep mix

2580.4 --> 2587.2000000000003
get the [ __ ] out of here you [ __ ]

2582.4 --> 2591.44
little scumbag you little scumbag

2587.2 --> 2592.64
piece of [ __ ] you're a liar

2591.44 --> 2596.079
yeah

2592.64 --> 2601.359
little little propagandist reinforcing

2596.079 --> 2604.1600000000003
liar scumbag pep mix a piece of [ __ ]

2601.359 --> 2605.2
yeah atom bombs don't exist they never

2604.16 --> 2608.8799999999997
exist

2605.2 --> 2611.359
yeah nuclear fission is conceptual it's

2608.88 --> 2614.079
not actual

2611.359 --> 2614.0789999999997
you understand

2614.24 --> 2617.68
because uranium

2618.079 --> 2623.52
it heats water

2620.88 --> 2626.079
water boils creates pressure

2623.52 --> 2629.119
differential

2626.079 --> 2632.88
causes turbines to keep running

2629.119 --> 2634.56
creates power that's it

2632.88 --> 2637.28
yeah

2634.56 --> 2639.68
that's it there is no nuclear fission it

2637.28 --> 2642.5600000000004
does not exist

2639.68 --> 2644.48
it never did it's a psyop

2642.56 --> 2648.0
people at the time

2644.48 --> 2651.2
were assassinated for the atom bomb saya

2648.0 --> 2652.4
because they wanted to speak out how it

2651.2 --> 2655.52
was fake

2652.4 --> 2658.8
and they killed them for it

2655.52 --> 2661.92
yeah not because they were revealing the

2658.8 --> 2664.4
secret and how to make it no because

2661.92 --> 2667.119
they were gonna tell the public this is

2664.4 --> 2669.599
a psychological warfare operation it

2667.119 --> 2671.359
doesn't actually exist

2669.599 --> 2672.8
that's why

2671.359 --> 2677.24
yeah

2672.8 --> 2677.2400000000002
get over it you numpty

2683.68 --> 2689.72
that's right nuclear steam engines

2685.92 --> 2689.7200000000003
that's pretty much it

2691.359 --> 2695.0789999999997
hey lana knox

2721.44 --> 2726.4
or was it that eight uranium at them as

2724.079 --> 2728.079
demonstrated

2726.4 --> 2731.7200000000003
i don't remember but yeah that did

2728.079 --> 2731.7200000000003
happen on camera

2736.079 --> 2739.6800000000003
right

2737.92 --> 2742.48
and it's it's kind of funny because with

2739.68 --> 2742.48
uranium

2743.68 --> 2748.64
apparently

2744.72 --> 2748.64
galen windsor i thank you for that

2748.8 --> 2754.0
with with that with certain types of

2751.04 --> 2758.079
uranium like not all of them but

2754.0 --> 2758.079
there is like a melange it's

2758.319 --> 2763.68
but yeah i think that the more pure form

2760.96 --> 2766.96
of uranium isn't even that toxic it's

2763.68 --> 2768.96
really when it starts to like transform

2766.96 --> 2771.28
because it does apparently do that over

2768.96 --> 2771.28
time

2771.839 --> 2775.359
that it kind of turns into plutonium and

2774.56 --> 2777.92
that

2775.359 --> 2781.0
substance is actually a super super

2777.92 --> 2783.2000000000003
poisonous right it's poisonous it's not

2781.0 --> 2786.48
radioactivity that kills you no it's

2783.2 --> 2788.319
literally poison it's just poison

2786.48 --> 2792.72
right that's what's dangerous about it

2788.319 --> 2796.16
it's poisonous not radioactive poisonous

2792.72 --> 2796.16
that's the that's the issue

2799.839 --> 2802.88
right because you know what else is

2801.52 --> 2804.4
radioactive

2802.88 --> 2806.8
porcelain

2804.4 --> 2808.8
yeah that's right porcelain is so

2806.8 --> 2810.4
radioactive

2808.8 --> 2812.4
if you have like the

2810.4 --> 2815.7200000000003
the scratchy thing that's

2812.4 --> 2815.7200000000003
what is it

2816.4 --> 2820.64
what do you call that the thing that

2818.319 --> 2822.4
measures radioactivity it just makes a

2820.64 --> 2823.839
scratchy sound yeah

2822.4 --> 2825.839
they go off

2823.839 --> 2827.68
when you're

2825.839 --> 2830.7999999999997
hovering in over porcelain because

2827.68 --> 2835.1189999999997
porcelain is just about as radioactive

2830.8 --> 2838.4
as uranium yeah it is like always

2835.119 --> 2840.88
yeah it's radioactive like uranium oh oh

2838.4 --> 2841.92
yeah well you don't have to wear hazmat

2840.88 --> 2845.92
suits

2841.92 --> 2848.92
when handling porcelain now do you huh

2845.92 --> 2848.92
huh

2906.079 --> 2910.7200000000003
[ __ ] volume yeah yeah yeah yeah

2908.96 --> 2913.359
i was just talking

2910.72 --> 2915.5989999999997
it would be kind of cool

2913.359 --> 2918.319
if he had it actually filmed just put a

2915.599 --> 2921.3590000000004
camera on the standard at the plant

2918.319 --> 2923.2799999999997
and then just take a swim

2921.359 --> 2925.119
on camera

2923.28 --> 2927.3590000000004
just to show like yeah i'm actually

2925.119 --> 2930.88
doing this

2927.359 --> 2932.48
that would have been really hilarious

2930.88 --> 2934.4
geiger counter yeah that's that's the

2932.48 --> 2937.04
one thanks thanks it's the geiger

2934.4 --> 2937.04
counter right

2939.68 --> 2943.839
or the clicky scratchy machine

2944.079 --> 2947.6400000000003
it's more descriptive

2962.96 --> 2965.96
um

2972.8 --> 2975.8
hmm

2995.44 --> 3000.079
i'll be in this video when galen winter

2998.16 --> 3002.48
has been memory hauled

3000.079 --> 3002.48
has it

3004.079 --> 3007.76
i mean

3005.92 --> 3011.599
i bet it's still

3007.76 --> 3014.4
out there on an authorized tv

3011.599 --> 3014.4
latin nooks

3019.76 --> 3024.0
and i don't think it's been memory hold

3022.079 --> 3025.599
really

3024.0 --> 3028.64
not more than

3025.599 --> 3028.6400000000003
everything else

3029.119 --> 3032.559
right

3030.16 --> 3035.359
omen benjamin talks about things all the

3032.559 --> 3039.559
time that get memory hold

3035.359 --> 3039.5589999999997
because it's just so inconvenient

3054.64 --> 3059.839
from you yeah yeah yeah but like

3057.599 --> 3059.839
yeah

3062.64 --> 3067.319
hey elise g good to see you

3080.24 --> 3083.24
there

3083.76 --> 3088.9300000000003
what is the temperature

3086.4 --> 3092.0
it seems colder than yesterday

3088.93 --> 3097.24
[Applause]

3092.0 --> 3097.24
oh it is it's 30 degrees now

3115.92 --> 3118.2400000000002
what

3121.92 --> 3125.7200000000003
what are you talking about

3127.92 --> 3130.4
rick beck

3131.52 --> 3136.52
i have not seen a notification about

3133.52 --> 3136.52
that

3143.76 --> 3149.559
the full gallon interview what

3162.319 --> 3165.88
was that yesterday

3188.64 --> 3191.52
oh wow

3190.559 --> 3194.559
is it

3191.52 --> 3199.52
is it

3194.559 --> 3201.28
retired polish astronaut mira slav

3199.52 --> 3204.0
haramas

3201.28 --> 3204.0
vensky

3205.28 --> 3210.7200000000003
that's what i got a notification for i

3207.359 --> 3210.72
don't know what you're talking about

3210.8 --> 3214.04
right back

3245.359 --> 3248.359
ah

3272.559 --> 3275.76
all right what's that

3276.839 --> 3283.119
oh oh right it's on his other channel

3280.559 --> 3284.88
apparently

3283.119 --> 3287.359
i'm not subscribed to that one i'll just

3284.88 --> 3287.359
do that

3291.44 --> 3297.04
yeah i remember that

3294.319 --> 3297.04
that's the guy

3298.96 --> 3305.0
cool thanks for sharing that

3301.68 --> 3305.0
that's funny

3308.16 --> 3312.92
because we were just talking about that

3356.799 --> 3360.2
is a nuclear

3381.599 --> 3384.599
oh

3396.799 --> 3400.359
right anyway

3416.0 --> 3421.04
yeah that sucks there territory

3417.92 --> 3423.92
i hate it when youtube does that

3421.04 --> 3426.079
when youtube literally just unsubscribes

3423.92 --> 3427.599
you from people without telling you that

3426.079 --> 3430.0
is

3427.599 --> 3433.48
that is like the gravest offense it

3430.0 --> 3433.48
really is

3438.4 --> 3440.799
i mean

3441.599 --> 3445.28
like how are you even gonna keep track

3443.52 --> 3447.7599999999998
of everything

3445.28 --> 3449.52
you know

3447.76 --> 3451.8390000000004
there's people that i'm no longer

3449.52 --> 3453.2
subscribed to that i didn't unsubscribe

3451.839 --> 3455.359
from

3453.2 --> 3457.52
that

3455.359 --> 3461.16
that i have even forgotten because

3457.52 --> 3464.0
youtube does do that it's really

3461.16 --> 3467.1189999999997
mean-spirited it's really mean-spirited

3464.0 --> 3467.119
that youtube does that

3467.52 --> 3473.359
unsubscribe you from things without even

3470.079 --> 3476.4
letting you know it's that's

3473.359 --> 3479.04
that's basically a breach of privacy if

3476.4 --> 3479.04
you ask me

3479.359 --> 3484.64
like who the [ __ ] are you to meddle with

3482.559 --> 3487.52
settings

3484.64 --> 3489.92
of person people's personal lists like

3487.52 --> 3494.64
how the [ __ ] dare you

3489.92 --> 3494.64
youtube management how the [ __ ] dare you

3497.44 --> 3503.4
you should be sued for that

3500.079 --> 3503.4
big time

3510.96 --> 3519.04
yeah i know it's not like oh it's dude

3514.839 --> 3521.2799999999997
but you don't even get auto unsubscribed

3519.04 --> 3523.359
from deleted channels they remain in

3521.28 --> 3525.3590000000004
their list and then you have to

3523.359 --> 3528.16
basically

3525.359 --> 3530.64
notice that and then unsubscribe from

3528.16 --> 3533.359
the deleted channels yeah

3530.64 --> 3535.7599999999998
so that's not what it is at all

3533.359 --> 3538.0789999999997
it's just youtube's like oh

3535.76 --> 3540.2400000000002
yeah oh we're gonna unsubscribe you from

3538.079 --> 3543.2000000000003
that and not even tell you

3540.24 --> 3545.839
so in the hopes that you'll just forget

3543.2 --> 3548.48
about it and just forget about it just

3545.839 --> 3552.0
just subscribe to our main

3548.48 --> 3555.04
featured highly paid

3552.0 --> 3556.839
mentally narrowed down railroaded

3555.04 --> 3560.079
approved channels

3556.839 --> 3562.4
yeah just do that like how long is it

3560.079 --> 3565.599
gonna take before youtube literally just

3562.4 --> 3567.2000000000003
starts subscribing you two channels that

3565.599 --> 3570.559
you don't even know

3567.2 --> 3570.5589999999997
how long is that gonna take

3571.359 --> 3577.5989999999997
it really is a sign of pretty severe

3574.72 --> 3580.319
corruption that that happens

3577.599 --> 3583.2000000000003
like it should not be mechanically

3580.319 --> 3585.2
possible that that happens

3583.2 --> 3588.799
it shouldn't be

3585.2 --> 3591.799
it's a security breach it's a privacy

3588.799 --> 3591.799
breach

3612.559 --> 3615.799
hey crockett

3646.63 --> 3649.7290000000003
[Applause]

3654.93 --> 3661.2999999999997
[Applause]

3666.54 --> 3671.9
[Applause]

3684.16 --> 3692.0789999999997
yeah tara 306 and if youtube does that

3688.16 --> 3694.319
then i will delete my account

3692.079 --> 3697.04
i will just delete it

3694.319 --> 3699.7599999999998
just like that

3697.04 --> 3702.319
if youtube starts basically telling you

3699.76 --> 3703.76
what what you are subscribed to if

3702.319 --> 3705.52
they're gonna do that

3703.76 --> 3708.079
then i want

3705.52 --> 3710.4
then the whole thing can be [ __ ]

3708.079 --> 3711.599
erased as far am i concerned all of it

3710.4 --> 3713.52
all of it

3711.599 --> 3716.6400000000003
wiped forever

3713.52 --> 3717.68
because i will need not be a [ __ ]

3716.64 --> 3720.8799999999997
part

3717.68 --> 3723.9199999999996
of any mechanism that tells me what i

3720.88 --> 3727.359
should watch you hear me

3723.92 --> 3729.44
nobody [ __ ] tells me what to watch

3727.359 --> 3732.0789999999997
you hear me [ __ ]

3729.44 --> 3735.92
it's not gonna happen if you do that i

3732.079 --> 3738.2400000000002
will delete my channel you hear me

3735.92 --> 3741.6800000000003
and i will never come back

3738.24 --> 3743.2
i will never even say the word youtube

3741.68 --> 3745.0389999999998
ever again

3743.2 --> 3748.16
you hear me

3745.039 --> 3751.28
i will find other platforms

3748.16 --> 3755.2
and i will do what i now do 10 times

3751.28 --> 3758.4
better with full range video support

3755.2 --> 3761.1189999999997
video clips of music that i [ __ ]

3758.4 --> 3762.88
choose to play i don't give a [ __ ] about

3761.119 --> 3765.52
copyrights you see

3762.88 --> 3768.1600000000003
i had to hold back so much here on

3765.52 --> 3772.48
youtube so much i had to basically

3768.16 --> 3775.2
rearrange my entire way of doing things

3772.48 --> 3777.44
just to accommodate for youtube's

3775.2 --> 3780.5589999999997
disgusting

3777.44 --> 3782.64
copyright [ __ ] policies if youtube

3780.559 --> 3785.44
is going to literally

3782.64 --> 3788.0789999999997
dictate to you in the future what you

3785.44 --> 3790.2400000000002
can be subscribed to or not then i will

3788.079 --> 3793.76
delete youtube

3790.24 --> 3795.68
i will completely erase it

3793.76 --> 3799.2000000000003
yeah

3795.68 --> 3802.96
and may those [ __ ] management people

3799.2 --> 3805.1189999999997
rot in jail forever or be executed for

3802.96 --> 3806.7200000000003
war crimes which they are no doubt

3805.119 --> 3810.6800000000003
involved in

3806.72 --> 3810.68
on top of all that

3810.799 --> 3814.16
i will make work of it

3816.799 --> 3821.28
i mean at this point youtube management

3818.799 --> 3825.079
the people at the top not the

3821.28 --> 3825.079
like the local groups

3825.839 --> 3830.0789999999997
the ones that are basically picking

3827.76 --> 3834.7990000000004
everybody out that

3830.079 --> 3834.799
these people are [ __ ] war criminals

3835.039 --> 3839.92
they're war criminals

3837.039 --> 3843.28
people that own the google system

3839.92 --> 3846.7200000000003
they're war criminals

3843.28 --> 3849.7200000000003
they should be arrested and executed

3846.72 --> 3849.72
publicly

3858.24 --> 3861.5989999999997
yeah

3859.2 --> 3864.24
oh and they're not doing it oh they're

3861.599 --> 3867.44
not doing the odd did the secret

3864.24 --> 3871.2799999999997
unsubscribing well it's your [ __ ]

3867.44 --> 3875.119
security issue then yeah it's it's your

3871.28 --> 3876.079
[ __ ] responsibility to ensure that it

3875.119 --> 3877.039
can't

3876.079 --> 3878.7200000000003
happen

3877.039 --> 3881.44
it's happening

3878.72 --> 3884.3999999999996
it's because of you oh you're not doing

3881.44 --> 3886.64
it well you're allowing it to happen

3884.4 --> 3889.52
it's your [ __ ] fault it's your

3886.64 --> 3894.7599999999998
responsibility that it happens whether

3889.52 --> 3894.7599999999998
you claim responsibility for it or not

3907.2 --> 3910.2
okay

3923.359 --> 3927.92
youtube and subscribe people if you have

3925.2 --> 3933.1189999999997
an interact yeah who the [ __ ] are they

3927.92 --> 3933.119
to do that who the [ __ ] are they

3934.4 --> 3940.1600000000003
like

3937.119 --> 3942.7200000000003
so if somebody is not just constantly

3940.16 --> 3944.8799999999997
squirting out [ __ ]

3942.72 --> 3946.8799999999997
they lose everything

3944.88 --> 3951.6400000000003
that's monstrous

3946.88 --> 3951.6400000000003
it is monstrous to do that

3951.76 --> 3955.8390000000004
and it makes no [ __ ] sense at all

3956.079 --> 3961.8390000000004
yeah people get unsubscribed from me

3959.2 --> 3966.24
without them even realizing it and i

3961.839 --> 3968.64
have a every [ __ ] day show every

3966.24 --> 3971.359
[ __ ] day every day

3968.64 --> 3973.2
yeah and people get unsubscribed from my

3971.359 --> 3975.5989999999997
channel without even knowing how does

3973.2 --> 3977.7599999999998
that [ __ ] fit

3975.599 --> 3979.52
oh if you haven't visited oh they're not

3977.76 --> 3981.8390000000004
active enough oh

3979.52 --> 3985.44
makes no sense

3981.839 --> 3988.48
i don't care if they say they do that

3985.44 --> 3988.48
it's [ __ ]

3989.44 --> 3995.119
people just get unsubscribed for no

3992.24 --> 3998.839
[ __ ] reason and it's criminal it's a

3995.119 --> 3998.839
breach of privacy

4026.96 --> 4029.96
so

4076.48 --> 4079.28
right anyway

4094.799 --> 4099.12
that's a wasp

4096.56 --> 4099.120000000001
hi boss

4099.279 --> 4102.88
is it okay if you just get the [ __ ] out

4101.199 --> 4105.04
of my room thanks

4102.88 --> 4105.04
just

4107.52 --> 4109.839000000001
thanks

4110.96 --> 4114.44
how did it go

4123.279 --> 4126.839000000001
is it still here

4132.64 --> 4134.96
hmm

4138.64 --> 4143.279
yeah not a big fan of wasps especially

4140.96 --> 4146.279
when i want to get on my chair for some

4143.279 --> 4146.279
reason

4167.52 --> 4170.52
hmm

4182.64 --> 4186.799
oh seeking star wars that looks amazing

4187.279 --> 4191.64
it's really really beautiful

4216.32 --> 4220.92
ah man it's getting cold in here

4238.239 --> 4241.199
a queen bee

4242.32 --> 4246.96
um

4245.199 --> 4250.08
it might be it kind of looked like a

4246.96 --> 4250.08
wasp it could have been

4250.32 --> 4255.759999999999
yeah it wasn't like a typical wasp so it

4253.12 --> 4259.12
was like extra big so maybe it wasn't it

4255.76 --> 4260.08
was i still

4259.12 --> 4261.599999999999
yeah

4260.08 --> 4262.5599999999995
it did have like

4261.6 --> 4265.52
yellow

4262.56 --> 4265.52
black stripes

4270.8 --> 4276.2390000000005
so maybe it wasn't like a hive wasp it

4273.199 --> 4279.5199999999995
was more like a solitary

4276.239 --> 4279.5199999999995
wood wasp or something

4280.88 --> 4287.679
and hey that my bee's nest has been like

4284.96 --> 4289.679
somebody moved in again and some b moved

4287.679 --> 4292.32
in there again so

4289.679 --> 4296.76
there's all kinds of bee like

4292.32 --> 4296.759999999999
insects go around again

4308.56 --> 4313.280000000001
cia was trying no

4311.6 --> 4316.8
why would they need to do that there's

4313.28 --> 4318.5599999999995
literally a webcam live streaming right

4316.8 --> 4322.719
there

4318.56 --> 4322.719
why would they send over a wasp

4325.679 --> 4331.04
i mean they could just like oh it's a

4329.04 --> 4333.12
webcam live click

4331.04 --> 4335.5199999999995
let's see what he's doing

4333.12 --> 4336.5599999999995
why the hell would you send like a spy

4335.52 --> 4338.64
wasp

4336.56 --> 4341.64
that seems a little

4338.64 --> 4341.64
excessive

4350.56 --> 4356.64
to push the unsubscribe button thank you

4353.36 --> 4359.639999999999
for that that was funny thank you

4356.64 --> 4359.64
right

4376.56 --> 4380.88
i mean could a wasp like even use its

4379.36 --> 4384.96
body weight

4380.88 --> 4386.88
to interface with the mobile phone

4384.96 --> 4389.52
could it like

4386.88 --> 4391.4400000000005
fly onto your phone screen to wake it up

4389.52 --> 4393.92
and then like

4391.44 --> 4395.28
push the unsubscribe button would that

4393.92 --> 4397.28
be possible

4395.28 --> 4399.12
with touch screen technology could a

4397.28 --> 4401.44
wasp do that

4399.12 --> 4403.599999999999
this is getting really silly by the way

4401.44 --> 4403.599999999999
but

4404.8 --> 4409.1990000000005
i think a wasp would definitely have a

4406.719 --> 4410.8
lot of trouble interfacing with a mouse

4409.199 --> 4413.44
on a pc

4410.8 --> 4416.08
but a touchscreen

4413.44 --> 4420.678999999999
might be possible

4416.08 --> 4420.679
it just needs to touch right

4427.679 --> 4435.04
i mean if people can pocket ban others

4432.88 --> 4439.400000000001
then why wouldn't a wasp be able to

4435.04 --> 4439.4
unsubscribe you from a channel

4440.96 --> 4443.36
sorry

4444.64 --> 4449.159000000001
sorry i gotta make some fun here and

4446.159 --> 4449.159
there

4465.84 --> 4468.84
hmm

4476.56 --> 4481.080000000001
yeah seeking star wars it looks amazing

4482.0 --> 4484.32
like

4483.12 --> 4486.08
if you could

4484.32 --> 4489.04
so you can start with it you should

4486.08 --> 4493.28
really like try to

4489.04 --> 4493.28
live film yourself in that place

4495.28 --> 4502.04
i could do a bit of a nature thing

4497.52 --> 4502.040000000001
maybe if you feel like it

4518.56 --> 4524.64
they would need a silicone foot pad

4521.84 --> 4526.0
to tap on the touchscreen well if

4524.64 --> 4527.76
they're gonna have

4526.0 --> 4530.88
like

4527.76 --> 4533.360000000001
radio transmitters and receivers

4530.88 --> 4537.12
installed on them

4533.36 --> 4538.48
they got like a harness like that wasps

4537.12 --> 4541.36
then why not

4538.48 --> 4544.0
have special silicone food pad just to

4541.36 --> 4547.32
interface with people's mobiles you know

4544.0 --> 4547.32
why not

4554.32 --> 4559.36
right i might have just given the

4556.32 --> 4563.84
military industrial complex a whole

4559.36 --> 4563.839999999999
new idea on how to screw with people

4564.159 --> 4569.12
i just hope it sounds too silly to be

4566.88 --> 4569.12
true

4579.52 --> 4584.159000000001
you need a thousand subs to go live

4581.76 --> 4584.159000000001
really

4584.4 --> 4588.48
right okay but i wasn't actually talking

4586.56 --> 4590.159000000001
about live streaming right that might be

4588.48 --> 4591.919999999999
a bit troublesome

4590.159 --> 4594.0
over there anyway

4591.92 --> 4596.719
i mean just recording it and then

4594.0 --> 4596.719
uploading it

4598.4 --> 4603.04
i mean you can upload videos right

4601.28 --> 4606.04
you don't need a thousand subs to do

4603.04 --> 4606.04
that

4609.76 --> 4614.88
since when do you need a thousand subs

4612.08 --> 4614.88
to go live

4617.12 --> 4620.92
since when is that

4624.0 --> 4627.0
there

4639.36 --> 4642.799999999999
two years [ __ ]

4643.679 --> 4646.0
man

4646.239 --> 4652.639999999999
i feel so lucky that i was even able to

4650.239 --> 4655.839999999999
make that video where i scream and whine

4652.64 --> 4659.92
about getting a thousand subscribers now

4655.84 --> 4661.28
because people now can't even do that

4659.92 --> 4665.28
well they could

4661.28 --> 4668.48
tape themselves and then upload it but

4665.28 --> 4668.48
they can't do that live

4670.64 --> 4675.2390000000005
need to get more active for sure all

4672.239 --> 4675.239
right

4680.48 --> 4684.799999999999
well i guess that the only

4682.719 --> 4686.2390000000005
alternative course of action would then

4684.8 --> 4689.28
be to just

4686.239 --> 4692.959999999999
find good clips and upload them

4689.28 --> 4695.759999999999
or to pre-record stuff for of yourself

4692.96 --> 4697.199
and then upload that

4695.76 --> 4699.12
and then

4697.199 --> 4701.919999999999
yeah if you're going to be doing that on

4699.12 --> 4704.32
a regular basis and you get a hang of it

4701.92 --> 4706.719
with some good quality some good input

4704.32 --> 4708.88
then i'll help advertise for you i'll

4706.719 --> 4711.52
even shout out your channel at flat

4708.88 --> 4711.52
earth debates

4714.64 --> 4718.0
right it's the least i can do

4718.159 --> 4722.4
i think you guys are kind of doing that

4720.4 --> 4725.44
for me as well

4722.4 --> 4730.199
so why not reciprocate

4725.44 --> 4730.199
you can go live with no subs what

4738.64 --> 4743.92
substitute be monitored right that's

4740.32 --> 4743.92
what i thought m appeal

4745.92 --> 4752.52
that's what it used to be are you sure

4748.8 --> 4752.52
seeking star wars

4764.32 --> 4768.639999999999
you need a mentor for this streaming

4766.08 --> 4770.4
stuff okay well i offer up my services

4768.64 --> 4772.320000000001
as a mentor

4770.4 --> 4776.199
if you need any advice

4772.32 --> 4776.199
contact me on skype

4805.679 --> 4808.679
hmm

4834.48 --> 4837.199
all right anyway

4841.36 --> 4847.48
and appeal says you can still just go

4843.44 --> 4847.48
live without sub so

4872.56 --> 4876.96
right yeah logical conclusion that makes

4874.639 --> 4876.96
sense

4880.56 --> 4888.080000000001
i have my phone number connected to

4884.56 --> 4890.719
definitely got over for 4 000 hours of

4888.08 --> 4890.719
watch time

4892.32 --> 4896.88
like how much watch time do i even have

4897.04 --> 4903.4
see if i can find

4899.52 --> 4903.400000000001
a number to that

4924.88 --> 4933.6
i got 1.4 k of 1.8 k of watch time

4930.96 --> 4933.6
in a month

4933.76 --> 4939.92
7 000 views

4936.08 --> 4939.92
that's the average it's giving me

4942.88 --> 4947.6
oh man i've had a quite a few new

4945.199 --> 4951.28
subscribers recently it seems

4947.6 --> 4955.52

or like if you found me because somebody

4998.96 --> 5005.44
actually shared the show

5002.0 --> 5008.159
in some forum or something

5005.44 --> 5008.159
that would be cool

5011.199 --> 5016.5599999999995
yeah flattersage i know i know you found

5013.679 --> 5016.56

5019.679 --> 5023.32
hey paul connell

5039.84 --> 5043.76
right but i'm talking about the

5041.199 --> 5045.5199999999995
newcomers right i'm supposed to be

5043.76 --> 5047.679
supposed to have like a whole bunch of

5045.52 --> 5050.0
new subscribers

5047.679 --> 5051.36
it would be cool if they let me know

5050.0 --> 5052.8
like hey

5051.36 --> 5054.4
i just found

5052.8 --> 5057.1990000000005
your channel

5054.4 --> 5060.48
this and that way

5057.199 --> 5062.879999999999
since i'm not like super vast or

5060.48 --> 5062.879999999999
anything

5063.44 --> 5070.12
then every every subscriber just counts

5066.96 --> 5070.12
you know

5070.8 --> 5074.159000000001
60 subs the live stream on a mobile

5073.04 --> 5075.199
really

5074.159 --> 5076.5599999999995
okay

5075.199 --> 5078.719
50.

5076.56 --> 5080.96
fine

5078.719 --> 5082.84
i think seeking star wars got that

5080.96 --> 5086.56
amount

5082.84 --> 5086.56
already let me check

5088.88 --> 5093.56
yeah yeah she's already there

5102.8 --> 5107.1990000000005
yeah i'm subbed too i wasn't for some

5105.04 --> 5111.239
reason i don't know why but i'm sub to

5107.199 --> 5111.239
you now seeking star water

5112.8 --> 5116.96
i found you through my chat

5121.28 --> 5125.12
you spread the word

5123.199 --> 5128.5599999999995
i'll take some credit please okay thanks

5125.12 --> 5131.84
paul connell i appreciate that

5128.56 --> 5131.84
where do you spread it though

5133.36 --> 5137.199
i'm kind of curious i don't even know

5135.36 --> 5139.92
like

5137.199 --> 5144.0
what people where people hang out there

5139.92 --> 5144.0
so except for like discord

5152.0 --> 5158.12
but yeah thank you for that paul connell

5153.76 --> 5158.12
i always appreciate being shared

5170.56 --> 5176.96
you're totally misinformed it happens

5174.239 --> 5180.638999999999
i mean the other day i was

5176.96 --> 5183.04
i thought that coca-cola was actually

5180.639 --> 5184.400000000001
started as like a grease a mechanic

5183.04 --> 5187.679
grease right

5184.4 --> 5190.96
that made absolutely no sense

5187.679 --> 5194.32
yet i've kind of had that belief for

5190.96 --> 5194.32
like a decade or more

5194.8 --> 5200.719
i don't even know why

5196.88 --> 5202.400000000001
it's just mandela affected in my mind

5200.719 --> 5205.04
right

5202.4 --> 5207.44
but yeah so you can start with at least

5205.04 --> 5210.679
you got you got options available so

5207.44 --> 5210.678999999999
that's good

5216.56 --> 5223.280000000001
every one of my fed super chats

5220.08 --> 5225.84
gets you five subs what

5223.28 --> 5225.84
it does

5226.32 --> 5229.32
okay

5253.04 --> 5257.92
right talking about super chats

5256.0 --> 5261.04
i could sure use

5257.92 --> 5264.4
the paypal donations right now still

5261.04 --> 5268.0
i mean yesterday i did complain about it

5264.4 --> 5270.719
a bit but yeah that still stands not

5268.0 --> 5274.0
really going to change

5270.719 --> 5276.88
i really do need support or i will

5274.0 --> 5281.84
run into more than usual amount of

5276.88 --> 5281.84
financial trouble this the coming month

5290.719 --> 5294.76
yeah thanks paul connell

5307.199 --> 5309.839999999999
right

5313.52 --> 5318.0
so i can always use more patreon

5316.0 --> 5319.679
supporters even little bits right if you

5318.0 --> 5323.199
just like okay i'll just send you like

5319.679 --> 5326.08
five bucks a month yeah that's

5323.199 --> 5328.719
like nothing but if a lot of people do

5326.08 --> 5332.0
that if 10 people do that then suddenly

5328.719 --> 5332.0
it kind of becomes useful

5332.88 --> 5335.88
right

5340.0 --> 5343.6
but yeah

5341.28 --> 5345.5199999999995
it's usually the guys though that kind

5343.6 --> 5349.04
of throw bigger numbers at me through

5345.52 --> 5351.4400000000005
the paypal that really helps

5349.04 --> 5355.92
and that keeps me fed

5351.44 --> 5355.919999999999
and i like being fed i like eating

5356.56 --> 5361.120000000001
yeah i don't like stuffing myself i

5359.12 --> 5364.719
don't do that

5361.12 --> 5367.679
but i don't like

5364.719 --> 5368.719
having less money so that i just like

5367.679 --> 5372.08
have to

5368.719 --> 5376.32
narrow down everything just to

5372.08 --> 5379.5199999999995
go like survive and all that

5376.32 --> 5384.159
and not be hungry all the time

5379.52 --> 5384.159000000001
so please support me through the paypal

5385.12 --> 5390.32
i will be worth it

5387.52 --> 5390.320000000001
i hope i am

5390.48 --> 5395.28
there's plenty

5392.48 --> 5396.159
of things to talk about and

5395.28 --> 5398.48
yeah

5396.159 --> 5401.199
the less i have to worry about money

5398.48 --> 5404.239
troubles the more

5401.199 --> 5406.638999999999
i can dive into interesting subjects

5404.239 --> 5409.12
it's just a natural result it's not even

5406.639 --> 5411.4400000000005
like oh i'm trying to hold you hostage

5409.12 --> 5416.0
for money no it's just that's the way it

5411.44 --> 5416.0
works it automatically works like that

5419.44 --> 5423.5199999999995
but yeah if i'm not getting around i

5421.52 --> 5425.4400000000005
have to share that i ca i'm not gonna

5423.52 --> 5427.1990000000005
hold it back and just pretend like no

5425.44 --> 5428.159
everything is all right i'm just gonna

5427.199 --> 5429.678999999999
go

5428.159 --> 5431.5199999999995
down with the ship

5429.679 --> 5434.8
and just act like everything is all

5431.52 --> 5436.8
hunky-dory until i get so broke

5434.8 --> 5439.12
that literally at some point you just

5436.8 --> 5440.639
don't see me appear anymore yeah i don't

5439.12 --> 5443.28
want to do that

5440.639 --> 5445.28
so i choose to whine and complain about

5443.28 --> 5448.5199999999995
how i need money from you guys just to

5445.28 --> 5448.5199999999995
get around

5449.6 --> 5453.4400000000005
and i know you don't like it i don't

5451.28 --> 5455.759999999999
like it i don't like when i watch my

5453.44 --> 5458.5599999999995
shows back and i see that part i don't

5455.76 --> 5461.1990000000005
like that part but i have to do it it's

5458.56 --> 5463.679
not a joke

5461.199 --> 5465.44
i can't just say oh no no i'll just do

5463.679 --> 5467.6
everything for free

5465.44 --> 5470.638999999999
yeah and then what

5467.6 --> 5474.159000000001
then you're gonna get me in hysterical

5470.639 --> 5476.639
moods because [ __ ] is breaking apart

5474.159 --> 5479.28
literally

5476.639 --> 5481.84
and bills cannot be paid

5479.28 --> 5484.719
and then big trouble and then literally

5481.84 --> 5487.28
me losing [ __ ]

5484.719 --> 5491.44
for no good reason

5487.28 --> 5493.759999999999
things that i cherish from my past

5491.44 --> 5496.48
like oh yeah oh what if one day i

5493.76 --> 5499.76
literally don't have storage i can't

5496.48 --> 5502.159
afford storage space to like

5499.76 --> 5503.12
store my old drawings that i made as a

5502.159 --> 5504.638999999999
kid

5503.12 --> 5508.0
yeah

5504.639 --> 5510.32
what if i just don't have money

5508.0 --> 5512.56
to keep that storage space anymore how

5510.32 --> 5515.04
about that

5512.56 --> 5516.88
yeah that's the kind of [ __ ] that's in

5515.04 --> 5519.12
the back of my mind that i don't want to

5516.88 --> 5521.28
whine about all day long but at some

5519.12 --> 5523.199
point i will have to

5521.28 --> 5526.88
because if i don't

5523.199 --> 5530.4
then all of this will just end and when

5526.88 --> 5532.639
it does i'll be so sick of everything of

5530.4 --> 5535.199
this entire situation i'll probably

5532.639 --> 5537.84
never come back

5535.199 --> 5540.48
not because i can't but because i'm too

5537.84 --> 5543.360000000001
sick of everything it's like a relation

5540.48 --> 5545.36
that's gone bad for too long and then

5543.36 --> 5548.0
when it breaks it doesn't go back

5545.36 --> 5550.5599999999995
together yeah that's the situation that

5548.0 --> 5553.679
it is going to push towards eventually

5550.56 --> 5559.080000000001
if i do not get enough support

5553.679 --> 5559.08
it's just a harsh reality i'm sorry man

5561.679 --> 5566.56
ah thank you paul connell for

5563.92 --> 5571.639
for the moral support in that

5566.56 --> 5571.639
because i really don't like it

5576.08 --> 5582.159
like i want to be in a better position

5579.76 --> 5584.2390000000005
i want my financial situation to be

5582.159 --> 5585.28
better

5584.239 --> 5588.32
but

5585.28 --> 5590.88
at the same time i want to keep doing

5588.32 --> 5594.239
what i'm doing because i'm building

5590.88 --> 5596.639
a skill and i have a momentum

5594.239 --> 5596.638999999999
in it

5599.92 --> 5604.2390000000005
i spend all my time all my time in the

5603.04 --> 5606.8
day

5604.239 --> 5608.799999999999
keeping focus

5606.8 --> 5612.56
sounds kind of weird right like focus on

5608.8 --> 5615.679
what yeah on everything on this

5612.56 --> 5618.400000000001
on the dreamwalking on

5615.679 --> 5621.1990000000005
having this option available to me in

5618.4 --> 5624.08
the moment to literally have my spirit

5621.199 --> 5627.28
reach out and grab something where a lot

5624.08 --> 5631.679
of people wouldn't even be able to reach

5627.28 --> 5635.679
that ability requires focus all day long

5631.679 --> 5636.96
it's a full lifetime dedication thing

5635.679 --> 5639.679
what i do

5636.96 --> 5643.32
to have these special abilities

5639.679 --> 5643.32
that i do have

5649.12 --> 5653.12
right but it requires

5651.36 --> 5657.28
freedom

5653.12 --> 5660.0
it requires me not to spend all day long

5657.28 --> 5661.5199999999995
trying to figure out how to rearrange

5660.0 --> 5663.52
myself

5661.52 --> 5666.719
how to

5663.52 --> 5670.4800000000005
let parts of my mind get occupied

5666.719 --> 5673.199
by financial rearrangement and like

5670.48 --> 5676.718999999999
things i must do just just to stay

5673.199 --> 5680.239
stable if i do that all that i do is

5676.719 --> 5682.4800000000005
lost you understand it's super draining

5680.239 --> 5684.239
to me it's so draining to me that when i

5682.48 --> 5687.44
was younger

5684.239 --> 5688.799999999999
i literally couldn't i couldn't i tried

5687.44 --> 5692.239
i tried

5688.8 --> 5696.4800000000005
to get like jobs and [ __ ]

5692.239 --> 5700.0
and they got me so depressed

5696.48 --> 5701.28
like i was so out of place of everything

5700.0 --> 5705.28
that

5701.28 --> 5705.28
it literally went insane

5705.679 --> 5708.08
from it

5708.639 --> 5712.4800000000005
and the conclusion was i'm not made for

5710.96 --> 5716.159
this

5712.48 --> 5718.48
like i can't be me and do this do that

5716.159 --> 5719.5199999999995
[ __ ] out there

5718.48 --> 5722.159
i mean

5719.52 --> 5725.52
i might be able to right now

5722.159 --> 5728.638999999999
but it will take my full 100

5725.52 --> 5730.8
focus and i would not even want to hear

5728.639 --> 5733.4400000000005
the word flat earth

5730.8 --> 5735.92
while i had if i had to do that

5733.44 --> 5738.32
i wouldn't even want to hear somebody

5735.92 --> 5740.56
say the word flat earth in all that time

5738.32 --> 5743.44
that's how much of a focus it would

5740.56 --> 5745.04
require for me to

5743.44 --> 5748.0
become that

5745.04 --> 5748.0
to attempt that

5748.639 --> 5751.76
right

5749.6 --> 5753.76
this is my career

5751.76 --> 5757.4400000000005
youtube

5753.76 --> 5759.360000000001
live performance improvisation

5757.44 --> 5762.879999999999
teaching

5759.36 --> 5765.5199999999995
and esoterics spirit mechanics

5762.88 --> 5767.04
cosmogeny that's what i do this is

5765.52 --> 5769.1990000000005
everything i've been doing everything

5767.04 --> 5770.48
i've been building up towards

5769.199 --> 5772.159
but it requires

5770.48 --> 5773.04
full focus

5772.159 --> 5776.239
and

5773.04 --> 5778.32
it's tiresome to me like

5776.239 --> 5781.04
i don't understand sometimes how nathan

5778.32 --> 5783.44
oakley can literally talk about the same

5781.04 --> 5786.96
flat earth mechanics and new things

5783.44 --> 5791.36
every single day i can't do that guys

5786.96 --> 5791.36
i can't it's too much for me

5791.92 --> 5796.8
it's too much effort it i can't narrow

5794.88 --> 5800.719
myself down like that

5796.8 --> 5800.719
i have to be brother i have to

5800.96 --> 5805.199
so that's why on the flat earth early

5803.119 --> 5809.48
work show i don't just talk about flat

5805.199 --> 5809.48
earth because i can't do that

5812.56 --> 5818.2390000000005
and yeah nathan does

5815.36 --> 5821.44
get my respect for that ability

5818.239 --> 5821.44
to be able to do that

5825.199 --> 5829.04
and i mean what's the alternative with

5827.119 --> 5832.48
him you know you want to have him talk

5829.04 --> 5837.199
about cars or sound panels all the time

5832.48 --> 5837.199
now that part i think is really boring

5838.84 --> 5844.159000000001
so is what it is

5842.4 --> 5848.839999999999
anyway thank you for the paypal donation

5844.159 --> 5848.839999999999
paul connell i really appreciated that

5855.76 --> 5858.88
if anybody else wants to join in with

5857.84 --> 5862.76
that

5858.88 --> 5862.76
i'd be very thankful

5869.04 --> 5875.679
i add value to nathan fvd i try to

5873.44 --> 5878.159
i try to be

5875.679 --> 5881.36
have comedic input

5878.159 --> 5883.199
mechanical intricate input right that's

5881.36 --> 5885.839999999999
that's kind of my special abilities how

5883.199 --> 5887.5199999999995
i discovered the irwinian paradox in a

5885.84 --> 5889.28
time when it was really critical to

5887.52 --> 5891.040000000001
discover that

5889.28 --> 5894.0
right

5891.04 --> 5896.159
yeah and qe is trying to steal that away

5894.0 --> 5900.56
like he invented no no no i was the one

5896.159 --> 5903.04
that's like really roll it out in detail

5900.56 --> 5905.280000000001
first yeah he might have taken notice

5903.04 --> 5909.8
but he never did anything with it

5905.28 --> 5909.8
so it's mine my paradox

5910.0 --> 5913.44
yeah i try to add value

5913.92 --> 5916.2390000000005
and

5916.4 --> 5920.799999999999
i don't know half the times that

5918.56 --> 5923.76
succeeds the other half i'm kind of like

5920.8 --> 5926.0
can't really find a good angle to get in

5923.76 --> 5928.320000000001
between the conversation i just it's a

5926.0 --> 5929.36
bit off it happens sometimes

5928.32 --> 5932.96
right

5929.36 --> 5932.96
but the other half it's great

5933.6 --> 5938.719
and it's almost like every time i speak

5935.679 --> 5940.2390000000005
up it's like a good moment so yeah ups

5938.719 --> 5942.88
and downs

5940.239 --> 5945.919999999999
but i'm really happy that i'm just able

5942.88 --> 5947.84
to be a part of the flat earth debate

5945.92 --> 5949.92
team

5947.84 --> 5953.84
longest lasting panel member too by the

5949.92 --> 5953.84
way just for the record

5957.44 --> 5961.678999999999
oh yeah yeah paul don't worry man

5960.0 --> 5965.36
yeah you're you're in australia aren't

5961.679 --> 5966.8
you how's things going there

5965.36 --> 5970.32
i haven't really heard a lot of

5966.8 --> 5970.320000000001
australia recently

5972.08 --> 5977.84
that's maybe not surprising with all the

5973.84 --> 5977.84
ukraine [ __ ] going down

5978.32 --> 5982.32
yeah thanks matthew hall i appreciate

5980.08 --> 5982.32
that

5983.199 --> 5987.159
ah

5984.159 --> 5987.159
colds

6005.36 --> 6010.4
convict island over here

6008.56 --> 6012.320000000001
right

6010.4 --> 6014.96
but do they still just

6012.32 --> 6016.48
lock people up for covet restrictions

6014.96 --> 6018.4
and all that

6016.48 --> 6020.48
or has they finally stopped doing that

6018.4 --> 6022.32
as well

6020.48 --> 6023.678999999999
i don't know anyway i'll be back in two

6022.32 --> 6026.679
minutes and then i'm gonna round out

6023.679 --> 6026.679
chill

6118.239 --> 6121.239
you

6121.84 --> 6128.32
yes are we nathan can't just have one

6124.8 --> 6130.159000000001
side of the debate on fed that's true

6128.32 --> 6131.44
that's true

6130.159 --> 6134.0
i mean

6131.44 --> 6135.36
a good ball win does keep things rolling

6134.0 --> 6139.44
doesn't it

6135.36 --> 6141.759999999999
as long as he doesn't always do that

6139.44 --> 6144.08
i know look at me talking about myself

6141.76 --> 6147.96
in the third person

6144.08 --> 6147.96
right you know what i mean

6151.44 --> 6155.678999999999
oh jesus

6154.08 --> 6159.239
[ __ ] oh i didn't know it was still that

6155.679 --> 6159.2390000000005
bad that sucks

6165.52 --> 6171.88
you would like baldwin to really attack

6168.0 --> 6171.88
the second law of thermodynamics

6172.32 --> 6175.119
david come on

6175.28 --> 6178.639
it's kind of pointless

6178.719 --> 6183.92
and it does really feel like blasphemy

6181.679 --> 6184.719
to god

6183.92 --> 6188.08
because

6184.719 --> 6191.52
i mean come on entropy is like

6188.08 --> 6193.6
the very foundational factor condition

6191.52 --> 6196.080000000001
for existence

6193.6 --> 6197.76
it's like even intricately tied with

6196.08 --> 6200.08
life and death

6197.76 --> 6202.84
which is kind of like

6200.08 --> 6205.5199999999995
part of the point of physical

6202.84 --> 6206.719
existence for us

6205.52 --> 6209.4400000000005
so

6206.719 --> 6211.28
i don't really feel comfortable even as

6209.44 --> 6213.199
balwin attacking the second law of

6211.28 --> 6216.08
thermodynamics but i would love to

6213.199 --> 6218.32
reference rompus though and just say

6216.08 --> 6221.04
well second law of thermodynamics

6218.32 --> 6223.84
actually doesn't apply

6221.04 --> 6223.84
to the earth

6224.56 --> 6231.159000000001
and to the atmosphere more specifically

6227.28 --> 6231.159
right that's it

6233.76 --> 6237.52
right because you could reason out that

6235.679 --> 6240.4800000000005
yeah secular thermodynamics doesn't

6237.52 --> 6241.679
apply to the atmosphere

6240.48 --> 6243.119
why

6241.679 --> 6244.719
because

6243.119 --> 6247.5199999999995
there is

6244.719 --> 6250.719
gases are not recognized for their

6247.52 --> 6252.320000000001
natural ability and classified in as

6250.719 --> 6253.76
fluids

6252.32 --> 6257.599999999999
so that

6253.76 --> 6259.84
there is no spreading in all directions

6257.6 --> 6262.320000000001
of gas because it's classified as a

6259.84 --> 6264.56
fluid and it everything just go down go

6262.32 --> 6267.119
boom boom so there is no

6264.56 --> 6270.2390000000005
entropy

6267.119 --> 6272.04
of gas moving in all directions then

6270.239 --> 6273.839999999999
right if you

6272.04 --> 6276.639
conceptualize

6273.84 --> 6278.639
physics on earth like that

6276.639 --> 6280.2390000000005
and you could summarize that by saying

6278.639 --> 6281.679
second law of thermodynamics doesn't

6280.239 --> 6283.44
apply to the earth even though an

6281.679 --> 6287.76
all-natural lock

6283.44 --> 6290.239
has always and only ever been

6287.76 --> 6292.320000000001
it out on earth right so it makes it

6290.239 --> 6294.32
becomes paradoxical as soon as you say

6292.32 --> 6296.239
second law of thermodynamics doesn't

6294.32 --> 6299.36
apply to the earth you immediately

6296.239 --> 6300.638999999999
invoke a paradox immediately

6299.36 --> 6303.28
because

6300.639 --> 6305.52
natural law can only ever be discovered

6303.28 --> 6306.48
on earth so how can you have a natural

6305.52 --> 6309.119000000001
law

6306.48 --> 6310.959999999999
that doesn't work on earth

6309.119 --> 6314.08
you could never have that that's a

6310.96 --> 6317.28
paradox in its own

6314.08 --> 6320.08
so yeah you can thank rumpus for that

6317.28 --> 6321.28
you could get a nobel prize from ndt no

6320.08 --> 6323.6
no

6321.28 --> 6325.759999999999
but i'll lay it down like i have right

6323.6 --> 6327.679
now right

6325.76 --> 6330.96
second law of thermodynamics doesn't

6327.679 --> 6335.04
apply to the atmosphere

6330.96 --> 6336.96
technically that's not even a lie

6335.04 --> 6339.76
you see

6336.96 --> 6341.119
but it is kind of semantic trickery

6339.76 --> 6343.119000000001
if i say that

6341.119 --> 6345.44
you technically can't say it doesn't

6343.119 --> 6349.44
apply to the earth

6345.44 --> 6350.48
unless you specifically say ball earth

6349.44 --> 6353.199
right

6350.48 --> 6355.44
if you invoke this presupposition within

6353.199 --> 6357.678999999999
that statement

6355.44 --> 6359.36
and with atmosphere it works because

6357.679 --> 6361.6
well the way

6359.36 --> 6366.08
the mechanics of the atmosphere has been

6361.6 --> 6367.76
conceptually written out is without

6366.08 --> 6369.76
gas expanding in all directions it's

6367.76 --> 6373.4400000000005
just the fluid it's just gonna go down

6369.76 --> 6376.2390000000005
go boom boom like liquids in that model

6373.44 --> 6378.239
so then yeah to that

6376.239 --> 6379.919999999999
framework setup

6378.239 --> 6383.5199999999995
second law of thermodynamics doesn't

6379.92 --> 6383.52
apply or it doesn't have to

6385.04 --> 6389.199
right

6386.8 --> 6392.2390000000005
so there you go hope you enjoyed that

6389.199 --> 6392.239
that piece of input

6396.56 --> 6400.92
and i'm gonna run out the show now

6402.159 --> 6406.638999999999
i'm gonna give paul connell a wrench it

6404.32 --> 6408.239
definitely deserves it

6406.639 --> 6410.0
and thank you for the paypal man i

6408.239 --> 6411.759999999999
really appreciate that it it really

6410.0 --> 6413.44
means a lot to me to actually get

6411.76 --> 6416.96
something

6413.44 --> 6416.96
after all that e-bagging

6419.04 --> 6424.32
i do get a bit jealous from nathan of

6421.28 --> 6424.32
nathan sometimes

6424.8 --> 6429.4400000000005
people do like throw money at him they

6427.44 --> 6431.759999999999
really do

6429.44 --> 6433.36
they don't seem to really throw money at

6431.76 --> 6435.679
me though

6433.36 --> 6438.799999999999
although some of you do and i really

6435.679 --> 6438.8
appreciate it when you do

6440.96 --> 6445.679
if god put the atmosphere

6443.6 --> 6448.0
there can only

6445.679 --> 6449.36
he can violate this

6448.0 --> 6451.44
yeah

6449.36 --> 6453.5199999999995
sort of like that it's rather the

6451.44 --> 6456.32
atmosphere

6453.52 --> 6459.84
is a cons is a concept that's not

6456.32 --> 6459.84
grounded in normal physics

6460.239 --> 6463.599999999999
and that's

6461.76 --> 6465.52
why the second law

6463.6 --> 6468.719
doesn't apply to it

6465.52 --> 6470.400000000001
because it's not built up

6468.719 --> 6472.4
through natural mechanics

6470.4 --> 6473.839999999999
right that's that's the semantical

6472.4 --> 6475.44
argument about second law of

6473.84 --> 6478.08
thermodynamics doesn't apply to the

6475.44 --> 6478.96
atmosphere

6478.08 --> 6481.92
that's

6478.96 --> 6484.88
that's the statement so there you go

6481.92 --> 6487.119
enjoy that

6484.88 --> 6489.4400000000005
right so thanks everyone for coming i

6487.119 --> 6491.679
hope you liked this show if you did then

6489.44 --> 6493.678999999999

that would be much appreciated

6510.8 --> 6515.4400000000005
