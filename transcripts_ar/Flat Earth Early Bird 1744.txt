178.48 --> 183.599
I'm kind of desperate of engorging

180.519 --> 187.87900000000002
because I am just starving

183.599 --> 187.879
here did not have much to eat

191.519 --> 198.92000000000002
yesterday but yeah I all the money I got

194.76 --> 201.599
over the weekend I've now spent on food

198.92 --> 206.04
so I got a bit of

201.599 --> 210.67999999999998
food I can make lunch again with

206.04 --> 213.12
eggs and bread for a while I got some

210.68 --> 215.0
dinner options the only real thing I

213.12 --> 217.72
really

215.0 --> 222.72
need but I guess it could wait another

217.72 --> 224.799
week maybe is I really need new oil I

222.72 --> 226.4
need new olive oil which is like

224.799 --> 229.4
insanely

226.4 --> 232.28
expensive but like the oil is really

229.4 --> 234.439
starting to get bad and you can feel it

232.28 --> 235.4
after eating french fries that I fried

234.439 --> 240.239
in

235.4 --> 241.68
it it's getting too old and damaged so I

240.239 --> 244.12
really need new

241.68 --> 247.28
oil but yeah that'll cost

244.12 --> 250.28
me20 is that just

247.28 --> 250.28
great

250.4 --> 255.56
H but oh

253.319 --> 258.0
well I'm really hoping to get some

255.56 --> 260.919
support I needed in multiple

258.0 --> 263.8
ways but we'll see what happens if not

260.919 --> 266.919
then at least I'll have something to

263.8 --> 269.759
eat and I'll eat this Illuminati cant as

266.919 --> 272.32
soon as it cooled off enough for me to

269.759 --> 272.32
to end

275.72 --> 279.88000000000005
gorgeous right anyway how are you guys

280.28 --> 287.23999999999995

284.12 --> 290.6
good somebody that just hasn't smoked

287.24 --> 290.6
cannabis in two

296.16 --> 301.56
days

298.56 --> 301.56
right

302.12 --> 307.479
so yeah yesterday was a pretty good show

307.8 --> 314.039
actually much better than than from sat

311.6 --> 316.47900000000004
than the Saturday day one of course that

314.039 --> 318.919
one is off the charts with the

316.479 --> 323.36
views everybody in the world wants to

318.919 --> 323.35999999999996
see me miserable it's an all

326.28 --> 331.479
attraction yeah it's not going to stay

328.72 --> 331.47900000000004
that way though

336.199 --> 339.56
hello Richard G good to see

339.84 --> 346.71999999999997
you so yeah I like to hang around 247

343.4 --> 346.71999999999997
Flat Earth Discord these

346.8 --> 351.639
days because creation bear is like

350.16 --> 354.36
hanging around there all the time and

351.639 --> 357.919
it's great having conversations with him

354.36 --> 357.91900000000004
he's like a very uplifting

358.479 --> 361.479
person

366.479 --> 371.25
ah but I was on there like 4 hours

369.68 --> 373.8
yesterday crazy

371.25 --> 377.36
[Music]

373.8 --> 380.0
stuff was I four maybe two hour long

377.36 --> 380.0
quite a long

383.16 --> 389.08000000000004
time and that was

386.4 --> 391.44
interesting it's like a flat Earth

389.08 --> 393.19899999999996
debate soft so we're still debating and

391.44 --> 396.84
there was a baller in there

393.199 --> 400.56
even but it's like not so

396.84 --> 404.11999999999995
harsh and a little bit more chaotic

400.56 --> 407.88
too there is a bit of a rassing

404.12 --> 409.24
problem but it could be worse and I mean

407.88 --> 411.759
yeah if you have a whole bunch of people

409.24 --> 414.68
just freely able to roll in then yeah

411.759 --> 417.08000000000004
that that's going to happen so but yeah

414.68 --> 420.28000000000003
it seemed pretty nice and I like to hang

417.08 --> 421.87899999999996
around there I had a really shitty day

420.28 --> 424.35999999999996
or

421.879 --> 427.56
whatever then I can just move in there

424.36 --> 427.56
and like it'll help my

430.44 --> 434.069
[Music]

448.319 --> 451.319
mood

452.919 --> 456.52
right so I don't really have new

454.479 --> 459.56
subjects to talk

456.52 --> 462.79999999999995
about world is still going on about

459.56 --> 462.8
Israel and all that

465.08 --> 469.68
and Alex Jones had a Sunday show where

468.039 --> 473.68
he was like fully on

469.68 --> 476.159
it and he wasn't even halfway

473.68 --> 481.879
bad what he act like

476.159 --> 484.12
he he's very neutral which is great very

481.879 --> 484.12
very

490.72 --> 497.24
sensible so that was a bit

494.56 --> 499.479
surprising and yeah well everybody now

497.24 --> 500.879
is expecting that yeah of course the us

499.479 --> 503.28
is going to be

500.879 --> 505.52000000000004
involved there already politicians

503.28 --> 507.039
already saying oh Americans got killed

505.52 --> 510.639
in the

507.039 --> 513.479
attack that Israel stood down for yeah

510.639 --> 516.599
yeah we know we know that happened and

513.479 --> 519.24
it's going to be a war you all know it's

516.599 --> 523.279
going to be a war like nothing is going

519.24 --> 526.08
to [ __ ] stop that nothing but like a

523.279 --> 529.04
freaking coup in United States is going

526.08 --> 533.6800000000001
to stop a war from unrolling now cuz

529.04 --> 533.68
they're going to do it one way or the

533.8 --> 539.0
other I'm not even saying bayen is going

536.44 --> 541.24
to do it like they might literally like

539.0 --> 544.399
take take him out of

541.24 --> 546.36
office so that they can go to war with

544.399 --> 550.56
isra with together with

546.36 --> 552.64
Israel yeah because of course nothing

550.56 --> 555.76
else is a good enough reason to take him

552.64 --> 559.399
out of office only oh but we need to

555.76 --> 561.68
make a lot of money going to war well

559.399 --> 564.079
that's a good enough reason to take

561.68 --> 567.12
somebody out of office

564.079 --> 569.76
right not that the economy is to all

567.12 --> 574.72
hell and it's total [ __ ] chaos

569.76 --> 577.279
everywhere but if he doesn't go to war

574.72 --> 580.32
well that would be good enough reason to

577.279 --> 580.32
take him out of office

588.92 --> 595.0
right so yeah I'm fully just waiting for

591.88 --> 598.6
that to happen and it's kind of weird

595.0 --> 603.0
like how my Visions roll it out at the

598.6 --> 606.2
time and and I was I was so like shocked

603.0 --> 610.56
that I got I gained so little

606.2 --> 614.88
information about it when I saw it in my

610.56 --> 618.4399999999999
vision was so incredibly minimal

614.88 --> 622.12
information it's just like yeah Iran is

618.44 --> 624.36
making a move a map view of it and that

622.12 --> 627.88
was it that was like the only [ __ ]

624.36 --> 627.88
thing about it that I even got to

628.04 --> 631.04
learn

636.12 --> 641.32
like I even during the vision I

638.2 --> 643.399
literally didn't understand why I did

641.32 --> 645.2
not understand why other than yeah

643.399 --> 650.16
Israel they want just they want to get

645.2 --> 650.1600000000001
rid of Israel which is completely

656.279 --> 662.16
understandable I mean I would want to to

659.2 --> 666.0
get rid of a nation that is super

662.16 --> 669.92
tyrannically anti-arab

666.0 --> 673.44
racist with open genocide and

669.92 --> 676.16
torture of of that race yeah yeah I'd

673.44 --> 679.9200000000001
want to get rid of a country like that

676.16 --> 682.279
too and if nukes actually existed then

679.92 --> 684.959
maybe that would have happened already

682.279 --> 686.8
yeah another reason why nukes don't

684.959 --> 689.6389999999999
[ __ ] exist

686.8 --> 693.079
ever it's [ __ ] [ __ ]

689.639 --> 695.44
yeah you think people will not push the

693.079 --> 697.0
button when they get confronted with

695.44 --> 698.9590000000001
overt

697.0 --> 701.72
torture yeah they

698.959 --> 704.4399999999999
do it's not

701.72 --> 707.8000000000001
real yeah if Israel could have pushed

704.44 --> 711.32
the button and blowed all hell out of

707.8 --> 716.3199999999999
like the entire region then they would

711.32 --> 720.0
have done that by now they

716.32 --> 722.8000000000001
don't because it's not real nukes are

720.0 --> 724.88
not real they don't have nukes they

722.8 --> 727.7199999999999
don't have nukes officially and they

724.88 --> 731.72
don't have nukes covertly secretly

727.72 --> 731.72
because nukes don't

736.6 --> 740.48
exist it's all hor

746.279 --> 750.88
[ __ ] hey Terra 306 good to see you

753.44 --> 756.839
I'm going to eat this thing

777.839 --> 780.839
cheers

788.6 --> 792.839
oh my God I'm so [ __ ] hungry it's

793.199 --> 798.4799999999999
unbelievable I think

795.279 --> 801.24
like not smoking cannabis has literally

798.48 --> 801.24
made me more

802.199 --> 807.399
hungry you have an important suggestion

805.32 --> 810.7600000000001
do

807.399 --> 810.76
you what is it

811.12 --> 815.36
it and what's so important about

837.759 --> 840.759
it

845.56 --> 848.7589999999999
no ter it

866.12 --> 869.36
pointless now I'm not going to get some

868.16 --> 871.24
kind of

869.36 --> 873.5600000000001
but I will ask though if there's new

871.24 --> 876.839
people and I want to give somebody a

873.56 --> 880.0
wrench I will ask how about

876.839 --> 884.12
that as in any of the secret servers

880.0 --> 887.839
caught anything on this guy right or

884.12 --> 887.839
winning Secret Service I love

888.199 --> 893.639
it also known as slowmo moonbuggy and

891.279 --> 893.639
Emma

897.68 --> 900.68
PE

918.519 --> 923.04
to unband their Globe sucks no that

920.639 --> 925.399
doesn't actually happen

923.04 --> 928.759
teret nobody's getting

925.399 --> 932.12
unbanned and besides you can't do that

928.759 --> 934.8000000000001
afterward do do you realize that yeah

932.12 --> 938.519
people can actually get

934.8 --> 941.24
banned even when it's not live but you

938.519 --> 945.92
can't unban

941.24 --> 949.839
people when it's not live you see that's

945.92 --> 952.88
impossible unless you are that freak

949.839 --> 954.8800000000001
that somehow has moderator powers like

952.88 --> 959.56
YouTube moderator powers and can just

954.88 --> 963.4399999999999
unban him without any logic behind it

959.56 --> 966.959
but in general people can't unban unless

963.44 --> 966.9590000000001
it's during a live

973.04 --> 980.199
stream yeah hey teret how about shove

976.48 --> 980.1990000000001
that committee up your ass how about

983.48 --> 986.48
that

987.519 --> 992.2
yeah

989.02 --> 992.1999999999999
[Music]

992.839 --> 997.44

[Music]

1077.4 --> 1080.4
now

1081.12 --> 1087.1999999999998
yeah so teret the point is a committee

1085.36 --> 1090.84
has

1087.2 --> 1095.159
say so why don't we

1090.84 --> 1098.799
instead make an Advisory Board

1095.159 --> 1103.7990000000002
yeah advisory boards give advice they

1098.799 --> 1103.799
never make decisions I'd be up for that

1107.32 --> 1111.28
sure

1109.08 --> 1114.28
but nobody's going to decide anything

1111.28 --> 1117.28

bunch of movies yesterday although they

1203.84 --> 1206.8799999999999
were not super

1208.48 --> 1215.039
interesting because day before that was

1212.08 --> 1219.8799999999999
Saturday I watched a bunch of

1215.039 --> 1222.52
movies Sonic 2 which was surprisingly

1219.88 --> 1227.0800000000002
entertaining like that was actually an

1222.52 --> 1227.08
entertaining video game movie

1227.159 --> 1231.8400000000001
surprising

1229.32 --> 1235.96
it was very dumb though but I mean here

1231.84 --> 1238.9599999999998
I'm going to say it Sonic is

1235.96 --> 1241.559
[ __ ] that entire game franchise is

1238.96 --> 1245.6000000000001
aimed at people that are

1241.559 --> 1247.96
adiq cuz they all talk like unbelievable

1245.6 --> 1249.52
[ __ ] retards and that really stood

1247.96 --> 1252.24
out in the movie

1249.52 --> 1255.24
too really

1252.24 --> 1255.24
dumb

1255.4 --> 1259.039
conversations but it's still

1257.0 --> 1262.84
entertaining though

1259.039 --> 1262.84
and Jim Carrey did a great job I

1263.28 --> 1269.2
thought he's really filling those boots

1267.0 --> 1269.2
of

1270.12 --> 1275.799
Eggman so I watched that I watched some

1273.4 --> 1279.5590000000002
Hollywood movie The Lost City which is

1275.799 --> 1280.84
like sort of a romantic adventure thing

1279.559 --> 1285.1589999999999
was kind of

1280.84 --> 1285.1589999999999
cute weird but

1287.039 --> 1294.72
cute very Hollywood gay though but not

1291.679 --> 1294.72
like literally

1296.36 --> 1301.9599999999998
gay and yesterday I started watching a

1299.08 --> 1304.1999999999998
new series Spanish one I always get back

1301.96 --> 1308.48
to the freaking Spanish series man dude

1304.2 --> 1311.72
there are so many of them and they're

1308.48 --> 1313.279
great so the Spanish Netflix series what

1311.72 --> 1316.279
the hell was it called I don't even know

1313.279 --> 1316.279
how to pronounce

1317.039 --> 1328.12
that let's

1320.76 --> 1331.24
see let's see if I can find it oh yeah

1328.12 --> 1334.9189999999999
Faria the darkest light it's pretty

1331.24 --> 1336.96
[ __ ] up it's like about a cult thing

1334.919 --> 1341.48
that's sort of secretly getting revealed

1336.96 --> 1344.279
it is hyper evil it's like super

1341.48 --> 1347.159
occult satanic I mean it is satanic

1344.279 --> 1348.76
although it's not like overtly saying

1347.159 --> 1350.88
it's satanic

1348.76 --> 1353.039
it's not like poser

1350.88 --> 1356.0
satanic but it's

1353.039 --> 1358.64
scary like where the

1356.0 --> 1363.64
r right that I watched it was turned out

1358.64 --> 1368.48
to be like cringe Hollywood woke garbage

1363.64 --> 1371.679
[ __ ] series horror [ __ ]

1368.48 --> 1375.1200000000001
lame that sucked that series sucked was

1371.679 --> 1379.279
super pretentious [ __ ] I hated it I

1375.12 --> 1383.4799999999998
hate Ram what a [ __ ] [ __ ] series

1379.279 --> 1385.72
right the Spanish one is like rayim

1383.48 --> 1388.48
except everything that was terrible

1385.72 --> 1391.48
about that

1388.48 --> 1393.2
scrapped and it's like cool and real and

1391.48 --> 1396.3600000000001
it's in a Spanish village and it's like

1393.2 --> 1399.159
a really Spanish F it's such a Spanish

1396.36 --> 1402.3999999999999
series everything about like I'm getting

1399.159 --> 1406.159
nostalgic watching that because I used

1402.4 --> 1408.6000000000001
to go to those types of villages when I

1406.159 --> 1412.159
went on vacation with my parents to

1408.6 --> 1415.3999999999999
Spain they really do look like

1412.159 --> 1418.44
that and like the people they talk like

1415.4 --> 1422.0
that they're gossipy like that and they

1418.44 --> 1424.44
get mob mentality like that and I love

1422.0 --> 1428.679
that series I like everything that

1424.44 --> 1431.6000000000001
sucked about ruim is great about

1428.679 --> 1433.799
Faria and it's actually scary it's

1431.6 --> 1435.8799999999999
freaky there's a weird Supernatural

1433.799 --> 1439.8799999999999
thing in it but they really keep it a

1435.88 --> 1443.6000000000001
mystery so it's a very mysterious occult

1439.88 --> 1448.24
series it is not hyper hallucina or

1443.6 --> 1451.4399999999998
anything like archive 98 or 91 whatever

1448.24 --> 1453.08
81 it's not hyper hallucinatory but it

1451.44 --> 1455.039
is

1453.08 --> 1456.9189999999999
involved and it's Bas yeah it's

1455.039 --> 1459.799
basically about a cult that's like oh

1456.919 --> 1462.159
let go of your body let go of your

1459.799 --> 1465.039
entanglements basically let's move to

1462.159 --> 1468.279
the Dark World oh yeah but yeah you have

1465.039 --> 1472.399
to die just don't think about it as

1468.279 --> 1474.919
dying yeah right you're going to have to

1472.399 --> 1477.6399999999999
die but just don't think of it as dying

1474.919 --> 1480.0
like literally like

1477.64 --> 1483.3200000000002
that it's pretty

1480.0 --> 1485.6
freaky it's freaky enough for me to

1483.32 --> 1489.559
actually get kind of uncomfortable about

1485.6 --> 1491.279
it because I have had people that Tred

1489.559 --> 1494.9189999999999
to do that with me

1491.279 --> 1497.88
too uh it's safe to say I didn't go for

1494.919 --> 1500.3200000000002
it and that's why I'm still here talking

1497.88 --> 1500.3200000000002
on my

1506.64 --> 1513.96
show so yeah Faria very Spanish not

1510.76 --> 1516.1589999999999
Mexican or whatever not woke it's super

1513.96 --> 1519.0
not woke dude they literally smoke

1516.159 --> 1522.72
cigarettes all the time on camera like

1519.0 --> 1528.159
all the time everybody it's great I

1522.72 --> 1532.2
[ __ ] love it I love super super

1528.159 --> 1536.2
anti-woke I love it it's so anti-woke

1532.2 --> 1539.88
when you watch it you forget woke exists

1536.2 --> 1543.96
it's that good you forget it

1539.88 --> 1548.88
exists yeah now that's

1543.96 --> 1553.1200000000001
good so FIA I'm loving it I'm like four

1548.88 --> 1553.1200000000001
episodes in it's really freaking

1553.84 --> 1559.6789999999999
creepy it is going to end badly though

1559.919 --> 1565.64
because one of these girls has been

1562.279 --> 1570.44
reasonably tricked into going with this

1565.64 --> 1570.44
freaking cold thing and it's super

1570.679 --> 1577.72
creepy job didn't end oh

1573.52 --> 1577.72
okay oh you're coming out of a training

1579.76 --> 1586.08
year right so you got a little bit more

1582.039 --> 1590.76
time I'm glad that it all worked out

1586.08 --> 1594.1589999999999
dude h steamy traveler is like in a is

1590.76 --> 1598.64
like might about to be doing that I had

1594.159 --> 1598.64
a long conversation yesterday on

1600.039 --> 1605.279
Skype I think I might have actually

1602.12 --> 1607.1999999999998
pointed him in a right in the right

1605.279 --> 1609.48
direction give him a couple of

1607.2 --> 1612.6000000000001
suggestions but yeah I'm not going to

1609.48 --> 1612.6
talk about it when he's not

1613.6 --> 1618.799
here but glad the job didn't end at

1616.6 --> 1621.56
least

1618.799 --> 1624.73
hello Dr utar good to see

1621.56 --> 1624.73
[Music]

1644.67 --> 1649.52
[Music]

1646.52 --> 1649.52
you

1667.24 --> 1670.76
you're glad I'm aware of

1676.519 --> 1679.519
what

1688.08 --> 1691.039
okay hello goov

1706.44 --> 1709.44
virus

1736.399 --> 1742.4799999999998
for

1738.36 --> 1742.4799999999998
okay calm down little

1745.12 --> 1749.4799999999998
computer it's time to go back to

1758.84 --> 1761.84
sleep

1766.32 --> 1772.12
o

1768.76 --> 1775.6
enough to give suggestions to the untra

1772.12 --> 1775.6
what I don't get

1775.679 --> 1782.159
it is not what you mean about my

1779.48 --> 1784.76
conversation with Sten it's just that

1782.159 --> 1787.64
he's having trouble like the normal job

1784.76 --> 1791.2
types that he takes are not available

1787.64 --> 1794.0
and he only has like freaking VX only

1791.2 --> 1796.0800000000002
jobs available to them so he was like I

1794.0 --> 1799.48
I need to take it into a new Direction I

1796.08 --> 1801.76
want this but I don't have it I wish it

1799.48 --> 1804.48
basically all started with like him

1801.76 --> 1806.8799999999999
saying I wish I have done I would have

1804.48 --> 1809.32
done this in school like I would have

1806.88 --> 1810.3200000000002
studied for this but it was too much at

1809.32 --> 1813.6399999999999
the

1810.32 --> 1817.12
time so I said like uh why don't you

1813.64 --> 1819.24
just do that again I mean you want to

1817.12 --> 1821.6
know all those things you could probably

1819.24 --> 1823.679
learn you're always already halfway

1821.6 --> 1826.24
there maybe you could like have a

1823.679 --> 1828.0800000000002
combined job with

1826.24 --> 1830.799
study

1828.08 --> 1832.84
because that particular type of job well

1830.799 --> 1836.08
there was a lot of that

1832.84 --> 1837.9599999999998
available so I think I like basically

1836.08 --> 1840.4399999999998
pushed him in that direction like yeah

1837.96 --> 1842.96
just maybe not just a job but like a job

1840.44 --> 1846.96
with a study and then you can

1842.96 --> 1851.08
become an engineer that's that's what

1846.96 --> 1855.3990000000001
he that he technically he isn't but he

1851.08 --> 1855.399
could become that he's like halfway

1856.24 --> 1859.24
there

1859.799 --> 1864.48
and I'm always very very freaking

1862.039 --> 1868.44
careful with giving people advice like

1864.48 --> 1872.96
that because I've gotten advice like

1868.44 --> 1872.96
that and then responded terribly to

1873.039 --> 1879.279
it like every freaking time I talk with

1875.96 --> 1882.08
my dad oh yeah that happened Saturday

1879.279 --> 1885.84
before the show yeah every time I talk

1882.08 --> 1889.84
about like money or jobs with my dad it

1885.84 --> 1893.1589999999999
always turns into a a nightmare for

1889.84 --> 1897.799
me cuz my dad for some reason just keeps

1893.159 --> 1897.7990000000002
on rolling out the worst possible

1907.0 --> 1912.12
suggestions that's why I'm not going to

1909.08 --> 1914.399
my dad for advice

1912.12 --> 1916.1589999999999
ever because he just always gives the

1914.399 --> 1919.1589999999999
worst

1916.159 --> 1919.159
type

1925.84 --> 1931.519
on the job training right on the job

1929.039 --> 1931.519
training

1934.84 --> 1939.84
trajectory but it only works when

1937.12 --> 1941.84
there's like a shortage of that type of

1939.84 --> 1944.559
worker

1941.84 --> 1946.08
right can have on the job training when

1944.559 --> 1948.08
there's like a huge amount of

1946.08 --> 1950.08
competition

1948.08 --> 1953.0
because then they'll just pick the one

1950.08 --> 1955.559
that doesn't need on the job

1953.0 --> 1958.08
training so it only works in certain

1955.559 --> 1960.84
circumstances when there's like a a

1958.08 --> 1963.24
vacancy of that type of

1960.84 --> 1967.24
profession and that it's needed all

1963.24 --> 1967.24
around and there's a shortage then it

1971.08 --> 1976.24
works so I'm sure you're going to find

1973.399 --> 1977.84
on the job training for electricians and

1976.24 --> 1980.88
plumbers right right because there's

1977.84 --> 1980.8799999999999
always a shortage of

1982.639 --> 1987.4799999999998
those but Engineers arguably

1999.6 --> 2005.9599999999998
too tell him you don't Define your what

2004.279 --> 2008.96
tell

2005.96 --> 2008.96
who

2029.54 --> 2032.67
[Music]

2065.879 --> 2068.879
h

2099.4 --> 2101.92
all right

2104.43 --> 2108.0
[Music]

2105.72 --> 2112.68
anyway I'm

2108.0 --> 2112.68
uh pretty much open for whatever

2113.56 --> 2119.7999999999997
subject although I pref like job and job

2117.2 --> 2121.3199999999997
training is not like the subject I

2119.8 --> 2122.119
really want to be talking about if you

2121.32 --> 2125.28
don't

2122.119 --> 2128.8
mind it was bit to bring it up for a

2125.28 --> 2128.8
moment but

2130.64 --> 2137.24
I'm sure there's more interesting things

2132.48 --> 2137.2400000000002
we can figure out what to talk

2155.8 --> 2158.8
about

2165.51 --> 2168.6690000000003
[Music]

2185.72 --> 2190.52

2813.319 --> 2817.839
about oh people getting sick after the

2816.079 --> 2820.6400000000003
test yeah because it was going around

2817.839 --> 2823.24
that they were going to test like like a

Wi-Fi

2823.28 --> 2830.96
Whiplash a 5G Whiplash to like make

2826.599 --> 2830.96

2833.52 --> 2837.839
on

2834.52 --> 2839.599
me or maybe it did I like got a bit of a

2837.839 --> 2842.72
sniffle for like half an hour and then

2839.599 --> 2842.7200000000003
it went away

2844.72 --> 2848.16
again

2846.93 --> 2850.16
[Music]

2848.16 --> 2852.48
but I have noticed that everybody in the

2850.16 --> 2857.0
house seems to have gotten sick around

2852.48 --> 2857.0
that time now that you mention

2860.68 --> 2864.8799999999997
it get sick the day yeah of course it's

2863.28 --> 2867.52
always the day

2864.88 --> 2869.96
after when they do that sort of thing

2867.52 --> 2871.88
thing it it's not like oh the second

2869.96 --> 2873.8
they do it and immediately you start

2871.88 --> 2876.0
having sick symptoms no that's not how

2873.8 --> 2879.6400000000003
that works yeah it will happen happen

2876.0 --> 2879.64
the next day of course it

2881.52 --> 2888.28
will I mean if a

2884.96 --> 2890.68
signal would be strong enough to like

2888.28 --> 2894.28
instantaneously give you symptoms of

2890.68 --> 2897.839
some kind of disease then it's probably

2894.28 --> 2900.1600000000003
strong enough to literally be deadly so

2897.839 --> 2902.7999999999997
I doubt it yeah if you're going to get

2900.16 --> 2906.2
sick like instantaneously from

2902.8 --> 2909.559
radiation you're probably going to die

2906.2 --> 2909.5589999999997

imagine pretty

3371.599 --> 3377.84
much so let's not casually have a

3465.039 --> 3470.28
Flat Earth okay let's talk about let's

3467.68 --> 3473.799
actually talk about the [ __ ] words in

3470.28 --> 3475.3190000000004

3540.28 --> 3545.7200000000003
just know that it's

3542.44 --> 3549.16
flat we know because it's measured flat

3545.72 --> 3551.3999999999996
calculated flat and all measurements and

3549.16 --> 3555.2
map making and Celestial navigation are

3551.4 --> 3555.2000000000003
based on that it is

3559.44 --> 3567.039
flat the Earth is flat everything that

3563.28 --> 3569.28
exists Pro that the Earth is flat only

3567.039 --> 3572.1600000000003

3910.72 --> 3915.16
great cuz he

3913.039 --> 3918.7990000000004
isn't he's a

3915.16 --> 3921.359
disgrace everything about him sucks he's

3918.799 --> 3926.079
a [ __ ] [ __ ] he can't get

3921.359 --> 3926.0789999999997
rudimentary logic straight

3926.44 --> 3932.44
he cucks to

3928.44 --> 3932.44
balarts for no damn

3953.079 --> 3956.079
reason

3956.17 --> 3959.2090000000003
[Music]

3977.24 --> 3983.0
wait is that a question to be diver then

3980.039 --> 3986.0
Navy vet or is that to

3983.0 --> 3986.0
akumu

4000.44 --> 4006.039
yeah that's right abound

4003.039 --> 4006.039
in

4006.279 --> 4010.68
500 they all

4009.43 --> 4013.48
[Music]

4010.68 --> 4015.2
suck they're highly outdated and they

4013.48 --> 4018.119
can't keep keep track of actual

4015.2 --> 4022.8799999999997
developments they just don't have the

4018.119 --> 4022.88
talent so they just recycle old

4042.92 --> 4045.92
[ __ ]

4072.92 --> 4075.92
for

4079.119 --> 4084.799
you never wore a mask well I have worn

4082.48 --> 4087.279
them like in the coffee shop because the

4084.799 --> 4089.359
coffee shop owner insisted otherwise I

4087.279 --> 4091.72
wouldn't be able to get in

4089.359 --> 4094.88
there and that's the only thing he

4091.72 --> 4098.199
hasn't done that now

4094.88 --> 4101.04
though but during the lockdown periods

4098.199 --> 4102.839
yeah had to wear a freaking mask to get

4101.04 --> 4104.679
in the coffee shop it

4102.839 --> 4106.5199999999995
sucked

4104.679 --> 4109.2390000000005
but I mean it's very short it's like

4106.52 --> 4109.2390000000005
literally two

4109.359 --> 4115.719
minutes they didn't really care too much

4112.08 --> 4118.719
they were just afraid to get closed

4115.719 --> 4121.56
down because they always have like the

4118.719 --> 4124.719
government on their ass about everything

4121.56 --> 4124.719
like all coffee shops

4130.96 --> 4138.719
do what big fan hate this see you so

4134.52 --> 4138.719
angry it's kind of funny

4143.679 --> 4148.759
okay all right well i' I'd love to like

4146.839 --> 4151.0
not have those issues anymore but I'm

4148.759 --> 4155.52
going to need some support to do

4151.0 --> 4155.52
that to be precise I would

4155.799 --> 4158.799
need

4160.239 --> 4165.3589999999995
like roughly

4162.719 --> 4167.2390000000005
4550

4165.359 --> 4169.719
and then I'll definitely not have

4167.239 --> 4172.159
withdrawal symptoms for a

4169.719 --> 4175.08
while I mean I'm going to be smoking

4172.159 --> 4177.92
less anyway like whatever happened

4175.08 --> 4179.759
recently the not smoking for 2 days it

4177.92 --> 4183.279
completely

4179.759 --> 4185.359
like how do you say that undid the whole

4183.279 --> 4187.92
buildup because I did have like a

4185.359 --> 4189.6
tolerant buildup in recent times which

4187.92 --> 4191.88
is very annoying because it just makes

4189.6 --> 4193.4800000000005
everything more expensive so in a way

4191.88 --> 4195.52
it's almost good that I had to go

4193.48 --> 4198.718999999999
through through this if I start smoking

4195.52 --> 4202.4800000000005
now I'll be much more sensitive no not

4198.719 --> 4204.56
cigarettes cannabis I still have tobacco

4202.48 --> 4207.48
thank

4204.56 --> 4210.4800000000005
God if I didn't have anything to smoke

4207.48 --> 4213.919999999999
that I can't even imagine what that's

4210.48 --> 4217.32
like like when I would quit cannabis 20

4213.92 --> 4220.4800000000005
years ago I I you better believe that I

4217.32 --> 4223.36
smoked a lot of cigarette well not

4220.48 --> 4224.32
cigarettes I don't smoke cigarette but

4223.36 --> 4228.08
like

4224.32 --> 4228.08
tobacco I rolled my

4229.44 --> 4234.089999999999
own

4231.04 --> 4236.0
right but I would love to have some

4234.09 --> 4238.56
[Music]

4236.0 --> 4241.76
support but I mean yeah if you none of

4238.56 --> 4244.8
you guys have it then none of you have

4241.76 --> 4249.280000000001
it so that's sort of the reason why I

4244.8 --> 4249.28
quit it's purely out of financial

4252.64 --> 4255.64
calamity

4258.32 --> 4265.4
cuz I don't want to quit I use

4262.08 --> 4267.88
it like I'm not using it just for

4265.4 --> 4270.719
Escapist entertainment or anything like

4267.88 --> 4275.400000000001
it stabilizes my

4270.719 --> 4275.4
mood in ways in like special

4275.92 --> 4284.679
ways and it's like just calms me down I

4280.56 --> 4287.04
guess it's hard to tell

4284.679 --> 4289.76
but one thing I definitely know it does

4287.04 --> 4294.8
and that it is like it helps my

4289.76 --> 4294.8
digestion cuz eating kind of sucks

4295.719 --> 4300.4800000000005
now not that I have a lot to eat so when

4298.88 --> 4302.639
I'm going to be eating it's going to be

4300.48 --> 4305.919999999999
like I'm so hungry that like I don't

4302.639 --> 4306.84
care that it sucks that to eat cuz I'm

4305.92 --> 4311.32
freaking

4306.84 --> 4311.32
hungry but I mean it's just not

4311.56 --> 4319.400000000001
great drink for three 3 days what what

4315.28 --> 4319.4
do you mean drink for 3 days I don't

4325.48 --> 4330.919999999999
drink I quit drinking in in uh January

4330.199 --> 4334.879999999999
this

4330.92 --> 4334.88
year definitely not going to

4338.8 --> 4344.0
drink I don't want to go back to that

4342.36 --> 4346.32
it's just going to be another like I'm

4344.0 --> 4348.36
quitting because I don't have money what

4346.32 --> 4352.32
you think that another drug will be a

4348.36 --> 4356.04
solution no because those cost money

4352.32 --> 4356.04
too that's the whole

4371.32 --> 4377.32
problem all right that's

4374.56 --> 4379.92
fine but yeah if anybody could support

4377.32 --> 4384.04
me sorry that I yell at you all but I

4379.92 --> 4386.52
mean seriously don't don't talk to

4384.04 --> 4390.04
somebody that is in withdrawal about

4386.52 --> 4392.040000000001
their withdrawal symptoms like you're

4390.04 --> 4395.88
literally asking for trouble when you do

4392.04 --> 4397.88
that you you don't ask somebody that's

4395.88 --> 4400.159000000001
going through withdrawal about their

4397.88 --> 4402.36
withdrawal symptoms you never do that

4400.159 --> 4405.36
that's really [ __ ]

4402.36 --> 4405.36
dumb

4406.08 --> 4412.36
they will get really pissed off or super

4409.679 --> 4415.76
sick

4412.36 --> 4419.04
so don't do

4415.76 --> 4421.159000000001
that I mean afterward like in a few days

4419.04 --> 4425.32
or something we can talk about it but

4421.159 --> 4425.32
not when I'm going through it my

4430.83 --> 4434.12
[Music]

4432.36 --> 4436.599999999999
God

4434.12 --> 4439.96
you got yell at you yeah but who

4436.6 --> 4439.96
cares you're a

4445.0 --> 4451.719
Ballard when you act like it then I yell

4447.76 --> 4451.719
at you cuz I'm not in the

4462.28 --> 4465.28
mood

4468.719 --> 4474.84
so yeah if anybody would like to help me

4471.12 --> 4478.88
out if they can if you still want

4474.84 --> 4478.88
to please donate to my

4481.48 --> 4488.879999999999
PayPal I think roughly 40 would do

4485.88 --> 4488.88
it

4489.8 --> 4498.12
45 if anybody could could f it in

4494.639 --> 4502.56
H I have no idea what that's like I've

4498.12 --> 4502.5599999999995
never gone on like Pharmaceuticals like

4503.639 --> 4509.32
that like I don't even use pain

4506.239 --> 4512.36
medication at all like I I'm that guy

4509.32 --> 4514.719
that literally sits through the pain

4512.36 --> 4518.32
even tooth

4514.719 --> 4520.639
AE I don't take pain medication anymore

4518.32 --> 4520.639
I just

4522.199 --> 4525.199
don't

4526.159 --> 4530.799999999999
now you're not going to get pain

4527.719 --> 4530.8
withdraw you

4531.92 --> 4536.52
see you just have to go through it then

4534.719 --> 4539.12
you get used to it and then it doesn't

4536.52 --> 4539.120000000001
bother you

4543.44 --> 4548.0
anymore it's the

4545.52 --> 4552.1990000000005
same are you sure about that I think

4548.0 --> 4555.199
withdrawal are different for drug

4552.199 --> 4555.199
though

4569.0 --> 4574.04
how's my left shoulder doing these days

4571.44 --> 4577.719
pretty well steam traveler I mean I have

4574.04 --> 4583.48
been like triple dosing vitamin C

4577.719 --> 4586.08
still but yeah it's it's doing fine it

4583.48 --> 4588.599999999999
the eating less has not like made it

4586.08 --> 4588.6
worse or

4594.239 --> 4599.44
anything so yeah my shoulder seems great

4602.36 --> 4607.32
really I mean it's not always perfect

4605.36 --> 4610.5199999999995
sometimes at night like I go to bed lie

4607.32 --> 4614.599999999999
it and then it's like H it won't lie

4610.52 --> 4617.120000000001
right or whatever but I mean

4614.6 --> 4619.6
yeah it's much better than it was like

4617.12 --> 4622.36
two months ago when it was like really

4619.6 --> 4622.360000000001
aching all the

4629.12 --> 4634.719
time weed has physical withdrawal dude

4632.44 --> 4637.0
weed had physical withdrawal 20 years

4634.719 --> 4640.52
ago too about in

4637.0 --> 4642.0
500 when I quit back then oh yes I

4640.52 --> 4645.0
definitely had

4642.0 --> 4645.0
withdrawal

4646.719 --> 4652.88
so I think it always has withdrawal at

4650.0 --> 4655.88
least if you're used to using it on a

4652.88 --> 4657.08
daily basis if you're just occasionally

4655.88 --> 4659.04
using it you're not going to get

4657.08 --> 4661.6
withdrawal but if you're just a regular

4659.04 --> 4663.76
user doesn't matter if it's super strong

4661.6 --> 4665.719
or not you're going to get

4663.76 --> 4667.88
withdrawals and I don't want to talk

4665.719 --> 4670.679
about it anyway

4667.88 --> 4673.6
so yeah so let's not talk about that

4670.679 --> 4676.719
again let's not bring it up again after

4673.6 --> 4679.56
I just yelled at everybody full lungs

4676.719 --> 4679.56
not to bring it

4686.52 --> 4694.0
up you can only bring it up if you sent

4690.52 --> 4697.159000000001
me at least 45 on the PayPal and then we

4694.0 --> 4697.159
can talk about it

4700.719 --> 4706.4800000000005
okay cuz I'll talk about it if I can

4703.719 --> 4709.12
like look forward to knowing that I

4706.48 --> 4710.718999999999
won't have that issue anymore and then

4709.12 --> 4714.08
it's fine then we can talk about it all

4710.719 --> 4714.08
you all day long if you

4725.08 --> 4730.8
want Nathan try you'd like to see Nathan

4728.44 --> 4734.919999999999
try to get Eddie Bravo on for a

4730.8 --> 4734.92
conversation yeah would be pretty cool

4739.12 --> 4745.199
I don't know if he'd still do that

4742.04 --> 4747.96
though I'm not sure I don't like where

4745.199 --> 4750.44
does Eddie Bravo even stand these days

4747.96 --> 4754.0
you know that's a that's a question that

4750.44 --> 4754.0
nobody can really answer I

4761.84 --> 4764.84
think

4786.199 --> 4791.5599999999995
you don't have Super Chat no I've turned

4788.44 --> 4793.5599999999995
it off because I don't get anything out

4791.56 --> 4797.6
of it

4793.56 --> 4800.360000000001
at all like less than 1% of it I

4797.6 --> 4805.1990000000005
actually receive and it takes over a

4800.36 --> 4808.04
month while the PayPal I get most of it

4805.199 --> 4812.0
is like uh 95% or

4808.04 --> 4816.84
something I'm not sure and also I get it

4812.0 --> 4819.52
very quickly so I yeah any support

4816.84 --> 4822.360000000001
please do it through the PayPal and the

4819.52 --> 4824.52
patreon and again sorry about yelling

4822.36 --> 4827.32
but I mean

4824.52 --> 4829.76
just for the record don't start talking

4827.32 --> 4831.92
or asking about withdrawal symptoms of

4829.76 --> 4834.76
somebody that's literally going right

4831.92 --> 4837.52
through it at that moment I mean it's

4834.76 --> 4840.84
really advise against

4837.52 --> 4842.88
it unless you like they'll talk about it

4840.84 --> 4845.56
if you give them money so that they can

4842.88 --> 4848.0
really look forward to actually stopping

4845.56 --> 4850.4400000000005
the withdrawal symptoms by getting it

4848.0 --> 4853.76
right then they'll talk

4850.44 --> 4857.28
sure but otherwise don't do

4853.76 --> 4860.0
that it's really

4857.28 --> 4862.08
mean it's like talking to somebody that

4860.0 --> 4863.96
just found out that they love they lost

4862.08 --> 4868.84
their loved one and then they starting

4863.96 --> 4871.28
talk about like like like fear of death

4868.84 --> 4873.52
and like what happens when you die and

4871.28 --> 4876.599999999999
all like that's no they don't want to

4873.52 --> 4879.320000000001
talk about it in that

4876.6 --> 4881.56

5022.76 --> 5028.320000000001
eat exclusively

5025.56 --> 5031.4800000000005
organic and I eat a lot less than the

5028.32 --> 5034.48
average person and it

5031.48 --> 5034.48
works

5037.719 --> 5042.159
a c here is 20 cents yeah good luck with

5042.76 --> 5049.280000000001
that and I know it's

5046.44 --> 5051.36
expensive everything is expensive here

5049.28 --> 5054.639
you might have caught on to that maybe

5051.36 --> 5057.679
that literally everything is insanely

5054.639 --> 5060.84
expensive here now it all like double in

5057.679 --> 5060.84
price in the last three

5061.36 --> 5064.36
years

5074.12 --> 5078.719
basic in yeah well I got those too metal

5076.56 --> 5082.280000000001
slugs

5078.719 --> 5083.159
cadil but Illuminati Kasa is a part of

5082.28 --> 5086.239
this

5083.159 --> 5089.92
show it's like the first gimmick or the

5086.239 --> 5093.28
second gimmick after like uh tumeric

5089.92 --> 5095.6
coffee which I don't drink anymore

5093.28 --> 5098.5599999999995
so it's literally like a gimmick of the

5095.6 --> 5100.719
show and besides it's really great

5098.56 --> 5103.400000000001
eating during the show because then I

5100.719 --> 5103.4
can last

5105.44 --> 5110.919999999999
longer and it's funny and it's actually

5109.119 --> 5114.0
really

5110.92 --> 5115.76
nutritious so yeah it's not cheap I know

5114.0 --> 5120.199
it's not

5115.76 --> 5123.719
cheap but it's worth it at times not

5120.199 --> 5125.4
always I mean it yes in this situation I

5123.719 --> 5126.56
like oh I'm definitely going to have to

5125.4 --> 5129.5199999999995
get an

5126.56 --> 5131.76
Illumina like no but I I had to get one

5129.52 --> 5134.2390000000005
now because literally when I woke up I

5131.76 --> 5136.6
was so starving I felt like my stomach

5134.239 --> 5140.4
was imploding and I literally had

5136.6 --> 5143.159000000001
nothing in house yeah not even a slice

5140.4 --> 5146.159
or a little tiny slice of bread left

5143.159 --> 5148.32
there was nothing here so I had to use

5146.159 --> 5151.199
all the PayPal money from the weekend to

5148.32 --> 5155.799999999999
buy food and stuff and I had room for an

5151.199 --> 5158.28
Illuminati cant so I got it

5155.8 --> 5159.719
okay otherwise I wouldn't even be doing

5158.28 --> 5161.5599999999995
this show now I would have already

5159.719 --> 5165.4
rounded out because I would have been so

5161.56 --> 5165.400000000001
starving that I couldn't focus

5171.04 --> 5178.96
anymore grabbed the wrong jug of milk

5174.679 --> 5178.96
and was seven bucks wow that is

5181.199 --> 5184.199

6673.92 --> 6679.119
subject yeah and apparently M AAL is

6676.679 --> 6681.32
gone I don't know where it's not the

6679.119 --> 6685.239
first time that happened by the

6681.32 --> 6688.32
way M has had her account deleted before

6685.239 --> 6688.32
and then she would come

6702.92 --> 6709.56
back mma's account is dud shut the [ __ ]

6706.4 --> 6711.96
up you scumbag you're not part of this

6709.56 --> 6711.96
show

6712.92 --> 6719.719
oh and she's not out there like she's

6717.159 --> 6724.079
not in my moderator

6719.719 --> 6728.079
list nobody removed a wrench from

6724.079 --> 6728.079
her and she's not in the

6738.88 --> 6741.88
list

6757.92 --> 6765.8
oh wait hey she is here

6762.0 --> 6768.84
what oh

6765.8 --> 6771.400000000001
okay what the [ __ ] why didn't I see that

6768.84 --> 6774.4400000000005
before

6771.4 --> 6777.92
the hell oh okay M AAL is still there

6774.44 --> 6781.159
apparently and in my moderator list what

6777.92 --> 6784.92
the hell why didn't I see that

6781.159 --> 6787.5199999999995
before it's just so weird

6784.92 --> 6789.36
man just sometimes they're like oh yeah

6787.52 --> 6792.599
let's see the list and then it just

6789.36 --> 6792.598999999999
doesn't show certain

6794.32 --> 6798.759999999999
things okay so M apparently is still out

6797.32 --> 6801.759999999999
there

6798.76 --> 6801.76
good

6819.079 --> 6825.32
doesn't look like anybody else that

6821.199 --> 6825.32
should shouldn't be banned is

6828.76 --> 6831.76
banned

6832.4 --> 6837.96
yeah looking all good okay so I guess m

6834.639 --> 6841.92
AAL isn't banned I don't know

6837.96 --> 6841.92
why I didn't see that

6844.56 --> 6852.84
before hey twit witht I had to unban you

whoever that

6856.88 --> 6863.159000000001
was somebody really doesn't like you

6860.84 --> 6866.28
then again I don't really trust you

6863.159 --> 6866.28
enough to give a wrench

6866.92 --> 6872.52
but but there's just certain people that

6869.44 --> 6875.0
continually they just get kicked out

6872.52 --> 6877.76
like you appear one time and then you

6875.0 --> 6877.76
