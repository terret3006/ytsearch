weather today again is beautiful

121.439 --> 127.979
very similar to yesterday even less

124.799 --> 129.53900000000002
Haze up there just a couple of tiny

127.979 --> 132.599
fluffy clouds

129.539 --> 135.23899999999998
lots of Blue Sky no trails

132.599 --> 136.85999999999999
or Trail remnants seeing plenty of

135.239 --> 139.4
planes go up there but they're not

136.86 --> 139.4
leaving anything

140.459 --> 147.08
so yeah beautiful

143.819 --> 147.07999999999998
late summer day

171.0 --> 173.599
okay

176.4 --> 183.26000000000002
hello dear Peyton yet

180.599 --> 186.72
first in chat

183.26 --> 189.959
bjcnet good to see you

186.72 --> 192.959
it is Thursday the 1st of September

189.959 --> 192.959
2022.

201.0 --> 203.459
right

202.2 --> 205.73899999999998
so

203.459 --> 207.84
yeah I feel a little

205.739 --> 209.81900000000002
I don't know what it is

207.84 --> 212.159
been trying to call my healer but he's

209.819 --> 216.06
not picking up it's just really annoying

212.159 --> 219.0
because I could really use it

216.06 --> 221.7
just had a lot of tension yesterday

219.0 --> 225.019
evening it was just

221.7 --> 225.01899999999998
not very pleasant

225.9 --> 230.459
right I'm also think it might have

227.94 --> 233.34
something to do with the alcohol on the

230.459 --> 236.58
beers that have been drinking

233.34 --> 240.239
so I'm gonna try today to not do that

236.58 --> 243.06
and just skip it on that entirely

240.239 --> 245.94
and then hopefully this situation will

243.06 --> 249.379
settle down there

245.94 --> 249.379
and Mike to the niche

256.139 --> 260.23900000000003
tension stress is horrible yeah

261.239 --> 264.32
hey Susie s

264.6 --> 269.88
foreign

266.759 --> 271.8
well yesterday also just the tension at

269.88 --> 273.65999999999997
the Flat Earth debates ran a little too

271.8 --> 274.86
high I think

273.66 --> 279.0
I

274.86 --> 282.12
was enjoying it sort of but like which

279.0 --> 284.22
it went really

282.12 --> 287.759
bad

284.22 --> 290.46000000000004
and there were all kinds of freaky side

287.759 --> 292.32
effects that as an empath I was picking

290.46 --> 294.71999999999997
up

292.32 --> 298.199
and yeah

294.72 --> 301.91900000000004
I think I got tagged not that I think

298.199 --> 303.66
he's done that on purpose it it's never

301.919 --> 307.69899999999996
really conscious it's usually just

303.66 --> 307.699
what's happening to them does that

308.04 --> 311.82
and yeah

309.84 --> 314.88
because like yesterday's Flat Earth

311.82 --> 317.06
debate was epic but it was just way too

314.88 --> 317.06
long

318.54 --> 326.759
I mean come on it it literally lasted

321.72 --> 326.759
like three and a half hours live crazy

329.12 --> 335.16
and it was too much for me like even

333.06 --> 337.5
weirdly enough thinking about about back

335.16 --> 339.91900000000004
about it just makes me feel sick it was

337.5 --> 339.919
too much

346.639 --> 354.72
also just rock Us in the chat

350.94 --> 358.259
at this stupid situation with jado

354.72 --> 360.84000000000003
and Paula level up

358.259 --> 363.72
and

360.84 --> 366.35999999999996
I was just trying to keep order and then

363.72 --> 368.639
at the end like oh now our win is all

366.36 --> 369.84000000000003
the bad man again intense man got on my

368.639 --> 374.06
ass

369.84 --> 374.06
and I'm just like what the [ __ ] man

376.8 --> 381.06
uh

379.199 --> 384.08000000000004
anyway hello Scott

381.06 --> 384.08
and Brandon Cook

394.919 --> 400.19899999999996
yeah BJC net but I think that Nathan was

397.62 --> 401.639
just kind of using the moment to set a

400.199 --> 402.78000000000003
precedent

401.639 --> 405.539
right

402.78 --> 408.479
because it's The Ether Wars and he yeah

405.539 --> 411.3
wits it is

408.479 --> 413.639
well one of the more competent opponents

411.3 --> 417.06
when it comes to that

413.639 --> 420.12
and sort of a representative of a scene

417.06 --> 422.1
yeah this was being revealed

420.12 --> 424.699
so he just

422.1 --> 424.699
yeah

424.979 --> 432.0
did a full go like this just to set a

428.16 --> 433.139
precedent just to show like no it's it's

432.0 --> 435.18
really

433.139 --> 439.699
this is really what it is life right

435.18 --> 439.699
because life means life means unedited

440.88 --> 444.539
right but don't expect Nathan to be

442.8 --> 446.099
doing that all the time and that there's

444.539 --> 447.96
a good chance that he's not even gonna

446.099 --> 450.319
do a show today because he's just too

447.96 --> 450.31899999999996
tired

453.479 --> 459.06
I would not be surprised

456.84 --> 460.56
or if he's gonna do a show he's probably

459.06 --> 463.56
gonna be kind of in the background

460.56 --> 465.3
mostly and keep it short

463.56 --> 468.78000000000003
because after a day like yesterday

465.3 --> 471.78000000000003
there's no way you can just like

468.78 --> 474.539
go straight at it again to the same

471.78 --> 476.05999999999995
level it's too like too much energy was

474.539 --> 480.199
used

476.06 --> 480.199
for that anyway

488.099 --> 493.52
foreign

489.78 --> 493.52
it was really intense yesterday

497.52 --> 504.599
there were grievances except that right

500.879 --> 508.44
now I feel too sick to deal with him and

504.599 --> 510.78
that's why I wanted to have my yeah my

508.44 --> 514.8
healer online

510.78 --> 517.8
she usually helps me with that a lot

514.8 --> 521.9399999999999
so that I I can just calmly tackle

517.8 --> 523.9789999999999
things now it's like it's sitting on me

521.94 --> 526.62
I can't address it without just

523.979 --> 529.26
instantly making me sick

526.62 --> 532.26
because it did make me sick and it did

529.26 --> 535.2
go over my sensitivity borders

532.26 --> 536.8199999999999
but I had to hold on and just do my duty

535.2 --> 540.6600000000001
as I see it

536.82 --> 543.36
but yeah you get attacked from that

540.66 --> 545.64
like a spirit tag it's one of those

543.36 --> 546.779
effects it's I have to deal with that as

545.64 --> 549.56
a

546.779 --> 549.56
empath

549.66 --> 552.0799999999999
yeah

567.48 --> 569.66
foreign

577.2 --> 580.2
Benjamin

581.1 --> 585.44
this whole Gavin McGinnis situation

586.86 --> 590.3000000000001
just just ridiculous

590.519 --> 593.36
and

604.44 --> 608.8800000000001
right just

606.48 --> 612.0
oh yeah something really weird happened

608.88 --> 614.519
by the way really weird

612.0 --> 618.0
my mouse

614.519 --> 621.2
it's sadly completely restored

618.0 --> 621.2
like what the [ __ ]

621.48 --> 626.64
I kind of

624.18 --> 628.9799999999999
fixed it

626.64 --> 632.22
and really I did actively do something

628.98 --> 634.32
in order to to cause this I just never

632.22 --> 636.899
really look I'm not even using a

634.32 --> 640.019
platform for my mouse right now and it's

636.899 --> 642.36
working like better than his ever had

640.019 --> 643.74
like in years this is really really

642.36 --> 646.26
weird

643.74 --> 648.839
I'm still using the same dirty old mouse

646.26 --> 652.019
and it's just working perfectly even

648.839 --> 654.7790000000001
without a mat and it

652.019 --> 657.18
this is what I think happened

654.779 --> 659.76
okay sometimes I get a little pissed off

657.18 --> 663.42
and then I'm like and I bang my mouse

659.76 --> 664.86
it's like not super hard but slightly

663.42 --> 666.24
hard like

664.86 --> 668.519
like that

666.24 --> 672.12
well

668.519 --> 674.579
it seems that if you do that

672.12 --> 677.579
like too much

674.579 --> 681.5999999999999
I think the laser

677.579 --> 685.38
thing that actually directs the mouse

681.6 --> 687.3000000000001
that it gets dislocated slightly really

685.38 --> 691.019
I didn't even know that it's possibility

687.3 --> 692.519
but what I did is since I always Bang it

691.019 --> 694.98
Like That

692.519 --> 698.1
turn it around

694.98 --> 702.24
bang it like that and guess what it's

698.1 --> 705.1800000000001
relocated and now it's working like new

702.24 --> 708.3
so that's really weird

705.18 --> 709.8
like really weird I totally did not

708.3 --> 712.26
expect that

709.8 --> 714.7199999999999
and yeah I guess I'm gonna have to

712.26 --> 717.12
return that Mouse

714.72 --> 719.279
unopened

717.12 --> 721.74
I'm gonna return it it's gonna save me

719.279 --> 724.7
some money which I don't exactly have

721.74 --> 724.7
right now because

725.04 --> 729.8
it's called a called battery what

735.779 --> 739.7
it's just computer agitation

740.1 --> 745.6800000000001
I MacGyver did

742.079 --> 747.3
I guess I did seeking star order I was

745.68 --> 749.579
just like hey

747.3 --> 751.5
why isn't this working it makes no sense

749.579 --> 754.92
it wasn't even working on paper so I was

751.5 --> 757.44
like I got angry with it logically like

754.92 --> 760.1999999999999
oh why did you work damn it and then I

757.44 --> 763.5
was like wait

760.2 --> 766.2
what if it got dislocated and I turned

763.5 --> 768.839
it around and took just did it once on

766.2 --> 771.4200000000001
an Impulse got back and

768.839 --> 772.6800000000001
what

771.42 --> 774.8389999999999
what

772.68 --> 776.6999999999999
that was it

774.839 --> 778.019
so I'm gonna have to remember that

776.7 --> 780.1800000000001
little trick

778.019 --> 781.74
or the future if something like that

780.18 --> 783.959
happens again

781.74 --> 786.44
now I know what I should at least try

783.959 --> 786.4399999999999
once

798.12 --> 802.139
raise your mice

800.339 --> 806.48
Corsair

802.139 --> 806.48
yeah I usually just go for Logitech

808.92 --> 812.3
at 306

813.48 --> 816.1800000000001
Nathan got his new computer I don't know

815.339 --> 818.7790000000001
Scott

816.18 --> 818.779
probably

831.3 --> 836.04
right anyway so that I guess is good

833.579 --> 839.3389999999999
news but I feel just really weirded out

836.04 --> 842.0999999999999
I feel so weirded out about it that I'm

839.339 --> 844.5
like

842.1 --> 846.72
it doesn't feel like profit I just feel

844.5 --> 849.24
really weirded out

846.72 --> 852.1800000000001
but I'm glad that I'm not gonna have to

849.24 --> 853.5
have like that 60 Euros expense which is

852.18 --> 856.279
a lot

853.5 --> 859.92
but hey it's a good Mouse I mean

856.279 --> 862.92
ironically it's still working this is

859.92 --> 864.5999999999999
because it was exactly the same model so

862.92 --> 867.12
yeah look

864.6 --> 869.399
if I'd had like plenty of money around

867.12 --> 871.5
then I'd probably like okay I'll just

869.399 --> 874.079
keep that Mouse as a backup which is

871.5 --> 876.24
always a wise thing to do

874.079 --> 878.519
but unfortunately I can't currently

876.24 --> 880.5600000000001
afford that and unless people are now

878.519 --> 882.9590000000001
going to drop money on me so that I can

880.56 --> 884.04
keep that Mouse which in a way I would

882.959 --> 886.1389999999999
like

884.04 --> 888.24
it's a very good thing to have as a

886.139 --> 892.279
backup and who knows for how long they

888.24 --> 892.279
will even be sold you know

894.6 --> 898.22
so donate to my PayPal

898.26 --> 902.279
that would be great I really need it I

900.48 --> 905.0
don't have a lot and it's just the first

902.279 --> 905.0
day of the month

906.54 --> 909.199
laughs

916.44 --> 921.24
like quarantine customer service oh I

918.959 --> 923.699
did I've never even tried that I just

921.24 --> 924.839
always get Logitech mouths because they

923.699 --> 927.199
always

924.839 --> 932.24
work better for me

927.199 --> 932.24
like in 20 years every time

932.339 --> 937.62
right and for my keyboard I don't really

934.74 --> 941.5790000000001
get new keyboards I got a keyboard from

937.62 --> 944.279
what is it 1990 this is

941.579 --> 947.4799999999999
from Dell

944.279 --> 951.72
from one of those old square box

947.48 --> 954.9590000000001
computers remember those flat

951.72 --> 957.72
square box computers on the Old Dell

954.959 --> 959.88
keyboards the best they click

957.72 --> 961.5
and they last forever

959.88 --> 963.12
where they get a little grouchy every

961.5 --> 964.74
now and then you have to put them in the

963.12 --> 968.0
closet for a few months and then they

964.74 --> 968.0
are perfectly new again

971.82 --> 979.0400000000001
okay turret well the one I ordered was

975.18 --> 979.04
like a G500 or something

979.5 --> 984.66
so it's bound it's probably even better

981.779 --> 986.959
than this one it's just exactly the same

984.66 --> 986.959
model

987.6 --> 990.139
right

1004.72 --> 1011.0600000000001
keyboard five years still works cool

1007.94 --> 1012.8000000000001
I got a Dell keyboard

1011.06 --> 1016.3389999999999
that's

1012.8 --> 1020.779
like 35 years old

1016.339 --> 1023.9200000000001
I've been using it for 20 years

1020.779 --> 1023.92
not even joking

1042.26 --> 1048.079
AP hot Mouse yeah

1045.38 --> 1050.2990000000002
but dude I'm so happy with these new

1048.079 --> 1053.96
type of laser mouses I still remember

1050.299 --> 1057.58
the stupid rollerball Mouse days God

1053.96 --> 1057.58
those things were [ __ ] annoying

1059.299 --> 1062.26
remember that

1062.36 --> 1067.6999999999998
and those mouses would always just break

1065.24 --> 1069.98
so quickly even if you completely kept

1067.7 --> 1071.74
them clean they will just dirt up on the

1069.98 --> 1074.419
inside and

1071.74 --> 1075.44
so these laser mouses are just much

1074.419 --> 1078.46
better

1075.44 --> 1078.46
great system

1082.039 --> 1087.32
rollerball what

1084.44 --> 1091.1000000000001
what yeah yeah they had that too all the

1087.32 --> 1092.96
mouses in the 90s were rollerballs

1091.1 --> 1094.2199999999998
there might have been a couple of laser

1092.96 --> 1097.22
ones but they were always having

1094.22 --> 1100.28
problems and they were super expensive

1097.22 --> 1104.679
but they just perfected that

1100.28 --> 1104.6789999999999
in the decade preceding that

1105.26 --> 1109.72
um

1107.059 --> 1109.72
anyway

1109.82 --> 1112.4189999999999
huh

1125.98 --> 1132.559
yeah the one pound Mouse yeah look there

1129.2 --> 1137.38
are really cheap mouses and they do work

1132.559 --> 1137.3799999999999
they just break quickly that's all

1158.6 --> 1163.3999999999999
right so anyway I think I'm restoring

1161.059 --> 1165.5
slightly

1163.4 --> 1167.179
I don't want to talk about infighting or

1165.5 --> 1170.38
anything but I'm up for talking about

1167.179 --> 1170.38
pretty much anything else

1170.419 --> 1177.26
especially if yeah you guys can manage

1173.9 --> 1181.2800000000002
to actually donate to my PayPal today

1177.26 --> 1184.539
could really use that and I'm also going

1181.28 --> 1184.539
to be needing that

1185.36 --> 1190.0
the next few weeks as well I'm I'm sorry

1197.44 --> 1202.1000000000001
it might also be because I try to pay

1200.12 --> 1203.299
off a little debt

1202.1 --> 1206.32
like

1203.299 --> 1206.32
behind payment

1206.48 --> 1212.24
you have to be done

1209.179 --> 1215.74
otherwise I'd get like 40 euros extra

1212.24 --> 1215.74
fine and I don't want that

1216.08 --> 1220.46
but because of that I'm just like

1218.299 --> 1221.9
slightly more tightened than even

1220.46 --> 1224.6200000000001
normally

1221.9 --> 1224.6200000000001
uh

1224.72 --> 1231.88
I have my your one set well one cent's

1227.72 --> 1231.88
not gonna do uh very much when cook

1244.64 --> 1247.64
foreign

1249.7 --> 1256.3600000000001
cook this is not funny to me

1253.34 --> 1256.36
you understand that

1265.58 --> 1269.86
what you're upset what are you talking

1267.62 --> 1269.86
about

1285.98 --> 1292.9
wonderful Mouse what generation is that

1288.5 --> 1292.9
yeah that's before you were born Terry

1293.96 --> 1298.9
we're talking like mid 90s now

1310.94 --> 1314.2
hey steamy Traveler

1316.58 --> 1326.6
is Amiga 1980s no late 1980s 1990.

1324.62 --> 1331.059
I mean Amiga

1326.6 --> 1331.059
was really about like late 80s

1332.659 --> 1339.3200000000002
but damir was not the only one that used

1335.96 --> 1341.48
rollerballs PCS too I mean even the PC I

1339.32 --> 1344.1789999999999
had after that

1341.48 --> 1345.32
took late Baldur's Gate and then such in

1344.179 --> 1348.76
the

1345.32 --> 1348.76
in the later 90s

1348.98 --> 1352.96
it had a rollerball Mouse too

1355.64 --> 1358.64
foreign

1375.58 --> 1380.059
it was all a little bit earlier in

1378.32 --> 1382.52
America but you got to realize I'm in

1380.059 --> 1384.32
Europe so we were slightly behind with

1382.52 --> 1387.82
that

1384.32 --> 1387.82
that's what I'm comparing it to

1403.52 --> 1405.82
foreign

1412.539 --> 1417.1589999999999
I was five back then so I didn't

1418.58 --> 1421.58
foreign

1439.539 --> 1443.96
conversation this morning kind of

1441.559 --> 1446.799
updating with my dad

1443.96 --> 1446.799
over the phone

1451.46 --> 1458.059
he's getting really updated

1454.28 --> 1461.059
I mean I could just feel it on him that

1458.059 --> 1463.76
he's he's been digging into all all of

1461.059 --> 1465.44
the media and [ __ ] for like a year now

1463.76 --> 1467.78
maybe more

1465.44 --> 1470.0
and he's become sharp enough very

1467.78 --> 1472.34
quickly

1470.0 --> 1474.679
and also he's basically constantly

1472.34 --> 1477.74
giving me feedback on kind of like

1474.679 --> 1479.6000000000001
lessons as to what to look out for

1477.74 --> 1482.48
with tricks and

1479.6 --> 1485.84
mind control thingies

1482.48 --> 1489.76
and he's like just proving me that he's

1485.84 --> 1489.76
getting a lot so I'm like really

1490.12 --> 1493.7199999999998
impressed by my dad

1494.539 --> 1497.74
so that's always nice

1497.78 --> 1502.6399999999999
so yeah he's building up a lot of

1499.58 --> 1504.799
strength recently very proud of him

1502.64 --> 1506.3600000000001
I mean what a difference would say 40

1504.799 --> 1509.32
years ago

1506.36 --> 1509.32
30 years ago

1519.58 --> 1526.4189999999999
ZX Spectrum

1522.62 --> 1526.4189999999999
I said we're all began for me

1526.82 --> 1532.46
yeah my brother had one of those

1529.82 --> 1534.799
at some point had a couple of video

1532.46 --> 1538.1200000000001
games very

1534.799 --> 1538.12
very interesting

1538.88 --> 1544.159
I still remember the dumbest video game

1541.159 --> 1546.5
I've ever saw that was so broken called

1544.159 --> 1548.96
rockhopper

1546.5 --> 1552.02
which was on the ZX Spectrum

1548.96 --> 1554.1200000000001
it was kind of a very cheap ass replica

1552.02 --> 1556.22
of bullet Dash but it was completely

1554.12 --> 1558.4399999999998
insanely broken

1556.22 --> 1561.26
because

1558.44 --> 1564.5
it was like boulder dash except

1561.26 --> 1566.6
rocks would just like instantly Traverse

1564.5 --> 1569.48
distances and like even go around

1566.6 --> 1572.6589999999999
corners and she had made absolutely no

1569.48 --> 1574.659
sense the entire game was unplayable

1572.659 --> 1578.24
and insane

1574.659 --> 1581.2600000000002
I still remember that Rockhopper what a

1578.24 --> 1581.26
ridiculous little game

1582.26 --> 1586.0
have you ever seen that Scott

1587.84 --> 1590.799
everything

1604.48 --> 1608.44
getting pretty hot in here

1609.5 --> 1614.84
what is the temperature

1612.5 --> 1617.919
oh wow I can't believe my mouse is just

1614.84 --> 1617.9189999999999
perfectly working again

1618.2 --> 1622.0
24 degrees Celsius right

1624.74 --> 1629.72
it's just so surreal that my mouse is

1627.679 --> 1632.779
just suddenly working without a mouse

1629.72 --> 1635.48
pad I can't believe this is real

1632.779 --> 1637.76
I mean I had to use like a paper mouse

1635.48 --> 1639.6200000000001
pad for like

1637.76 --> 1642.799
two years

1639.62 --> 1645.62
can you imagine two years

1642.799 --> 1647.6589999999999
it was like no I was just old

1645.62 --> 1649.58
and I was just like new again like what

1647.659 --> 1651.98
the [ __ ]

1649.58 --> 1654.1589999999999
is this really happening

1651.98 --> 1654.159
foreign

1664.659 --> 1670.7
was great it was great enough that I

1667.46 --> 1673.88
made super Bula Dash the video game in

1670.7 --> 1676.22
paper it's it can still be made if

1673.88 --> 1678.2600000000002
somebody could actually do that I'm not

1676.22 --> 1681.26
gonna program it

1678.26 --> 1684.08
but it's it's right there it's right

1681.26 --> 1687.62
there to become a Game reality

1684.08 --> 1690.5
it's fully fully worked out every detail

1687.62 --> 1694.3999999999999
every combination

1690.5 --> 1695.24
I literally got a matrix of effects as

1694.4 --> 1698.6000000000001
in

1695.24 --> 1702.08
your cross every object with everything

1698.6 --> 1705.1999999999998
else and then have like the combination

1702.08 --> 1706.8799999999999
I got a giant database on paper of build

1705.2 --> 1709.1000000000001
a dash of exactly

1706.88 --> 1711.679
how it will work the Super Bowl the dash

1709.1 --> 1714.26
version that is extremely elaborate and

1711.679 --> 1716.779
you can literally play other types of

1714.26 --> 1719.0
games in that game

1716.779 --> 1722.799
it's that elaborate

1719.0 --> 1722.799
so it's it's almost like

1723.02 --> 1729.5
it's getting slightly in the direction

1724.94 --> 1732.44
of nah Minecraft but not really

1729.5 --> 1734.9
Minecraft is very different

1732.44 --> 1737.8400000000001
it's just it's right there I really like

1734.9 --> 1740.6000000000001
bullet Dash I miss it

1737.84 --> 1745.279
and it worked great it had no broken

1740.6 --> 1746.84
elements it was a perfected simple game

1745.279 --> 1750.74
it worked

1746.84 --> 1754.9399999999998
it always works Rockhopper nothing about

1750.74 --> 1756.679
it worked it made no freaking sense at

1754.94 --> 1758.1200000000001
all

1756.679 --> 1760.76
like

1758.12 --> 1763.82
it looked like Bula Dash but it just

1760.76 --> 1766.0
really really didn't work like roller

1763.82 --> 1766.0
Dash

1782.539 --> 1787.1
right but yeah we just seen that the

1784.7 --> 1789.26
whole thing about one slight screw-up

1787.1 --> 1790.2199999999998
and your dad that was the whole kick of

1789.26 --> 1794.3799999999999
the game

1790.22 --> 1794.38
that was the whole kick about it

1795.26 --> 1803.5
is that it was extremely high risk every

1799.279 --> 1803.5
move and that made it really exciting

1805.46 --> 1807.94
anyway

1819.44 --> 1823.8200000000002
right yeah PGC yeah but that's now the

1821.899 --> 1826.52
that's the new Norm that's the new way

1823.82 --> 1829.82
the corporations do it instead of having

1826.52 --> 1832.399
game testers and delaying the coming out

1829.82 --> 1836.059
of a game which costs money to the

1832.399 --> 1838.8799999999999
corporation they're now just literally

1836.059 --> 1842.539
making the gamers the people that are

1838.88 --> 1844.8200000000002
gonna buy the game into involuntary game

1842.539 --> 1846.26
testers they're like forcing it on you I

1844.82 --> 1847.8799999999999
mean there's Gamers out there that are

1846.26 --> 1851.6589999999999
love to do that they'll be like yeah man

1847.88 --> 1855.14
I'll help out I love this game of course

1851.659 --> 1856.279
but they just like now it's standard

1855.14 --> 1859.039
like

1856.279 --> 1862.7
you buy the game then you have to game

1859.039 --> 1864.86
test it until it's fixed and then you

1862.7 --> 1867.88
can just play your game

1864.86 --> 1867.8799999999999
it's ridiculous

1872.38 --> 1880.0390000000002
foreign I mean if anything

1876.919 --> 1882.74
they should like half the price of a

1880.039 --> 1883.46
game when it first comes out

1882.74 --> 1887.299
um

1883.46 --> 1890.8990000000001
until it's fixed and updated to a way

1887.299 --> 1892.039
that it's really no longer has bugs and

1890.899 --> 1897.1
then

1892.039 --> 1897.1
the price should be full again

1905.0 --> 1909.039
right or like that you can

1910.64 --> 1915.5590000000002
yeah maybe different there should

1913.34 --> 1918.32
probably like be like some sort of a

1915.559 --> 1919.46
discount system that if you buy the game

1918.32 --> 1922.7
early

1919.46 --> 1924.799
and you promise to like give out game

1922.7 --> 1926.779
testing reports that you get it half off

1924.799 --> 1929.799
or something I mean that would be a much

1926.779 --> 1929.799
more sensible system

1938.96 --> 1943.22
yeah be using it

1941.6 --> 1946.12
anyway I don't know why we're talking

1943.22 --> 1946.1200000000001
about games now

1947.899 --> 1952.299
I had a visit from a good friend today

1949.82 --> 1952.299
okay

1953.059 --> 1958.279
hey Brandon Cook you seem to be throwing

1955.279 --> 1961.58
out a lot of really random [ __ ] did you

1958.279 --> 1963.08
like eat mushrooms or something

1961.58 --> 1965.9189999999999
because you're sounding completely

1963.08 --> 1965.9189999999999
incoherent

1966.2 --> 1969.74
like you're just

1967.82 --> 1973.1
you're in the group but you're just on

1969.74 --> 1976.24
the side babbling incoherently

1973.1 --> 1976.24
are you all right

1978.62 --> 1982.2399999999998
hey LG good to see you

2001.38 --> 2007.14
dude what is this your thing again

2009.82 --> 2014.039
get some fresh air I'm not feeling great

2100.96 --> 2108.42
are you seeing star water

2103.839 --> 2108.42
yeah already there by the way uh

2116.68 --> 2121.54
I still can't believe that my mouse is

2118.78 --> 2124.3590000000004
just working again like that I just I'm

2121.54 --> 2127.44
really perplexed

2124.359 --> 2127.44
and embarrassed

2127.54 --> 2134.02
that I did not figure that I did not

2130.839 --> 2136.2999999999997
even try that sooner I mean it's been

2134.02 --> 2140.02
like like this for

2136.3 --> 2143.52
almost two years I can't believe it I

2140.02 --> 2143.52
just can't believe that really happened

2144.4 --> 2149.2000000000003
but now I know this trick and I really

2146.92 --> 2151.599
hope that through this perplexity it's

2149.2 --> 2153.9399999999996
gonna like stick to mind forever that I

2151.599 --> 2156.28
never forget to try that out again

2153.94 --> 2158.2000000000003
if something like that happens

2156.28 --> 2162.46
what worked on the mouse you know it's

2158.2 --> 2164.8199999999997
very simple at least what I did was

2162.46 --> 2164.82
uh

2166.42 --> 2172.96
what I did was I said

2169.2 --> 2175.54
bang bang I did we

2172.96 --> 2178.56
oof

2175.54 --> 2178.56
and it's like new

2179.859 --> 2182.859
seriousness

2187.96 --> 2193.359
so yeah the laser pointer in there was

2191.2 --> 2197.0989999999997
probably slightly dislocated because of

2193.359 --> 2197.0989999999997
the tapping on the

2197.32 --> 2202.9
on the table

2199.3 --> 2205.119
so I tapped it the other way and that's

2202.9 --> 2207.7000000000003
it

2205.119 --> 2210.96
hey hey dank yeah you were my first

2207.7 --> 2210.96
member that's correct

2216.59 --> 2230.09
[Music]

2231.579 --> 2237.78
definitely croissant crimes now

2234.7 --> 2237.7799999999997
I don't think so

2241.839 --> 2246.52
oh and by the way just for the record

2245.14 --> 2249.16
the

2246.52 --> 2252.04
button click mechanisms

2249.16 --> 2256.24
have never failed on me

2252.04 --> 2259.24
do you hear in 10 years

2256.24 --> 2261.8199999999997
I really like this mouse I really think

2259.24 --> 2263.9799999999996
it is worth 60 Euros I think that it is

2261.82 --> 2267.28
that expensive because they just use the

2263.98 --> 2270.16
very best possible technological options

2267.28 --> 2273.1600000000003
for each part and I remember hearing

2270.16 --> 2276.52
that when I bought it I hear heard the

2273.16 --> 2279.8799999999997
store keep her out and he said that and

2276.52 --> 2281.98
it's like that is my thing

2279.88 --> 2283.96
that means I have to have that Mouse

2281.98 --> 2286.119
even if it is like three times more

2283.96 --> 2288.839
expensive than everything else because

2286.119 --> 2288.839
of that reason

2293.079 --> 2299.52
uh thank you for the membership system

2295.18 --> 2299.52
expansion tank appreciate that

2302.26 --> 2308.1400000000003
hey you can move ours

2304.9 --> 2310.0
hope all is well yeah I'm doing okay I'm

2308.14 --> 2313.7999999999997
a little

2310.0 --> 2313.8
a little drain from yesterday

2314.2 --> 2317.04
so long

2324.04 --> 2331.54
though you don't understand well you had

2327.7 --> 2334.24
a four hour opportunity to figure it out

2331.54 --> 2336.46
Professor Phil Bill apparently you

2334.24 --> 2339.9399999999996
didn't pay any attention in those four

2336.46 --> 2341.68
hours you were just listening oh Nathan

2339.94 --> 2343.7200000000003
sounds mean

2341.68 --> 2345.7
it sounds mean so I'm not going to

2343.72 --> 2347.9199999999996
listen to what he's actually saying

2345.7 --> 2351.359
right Professor Phil

2347.92 --> 2351.359
I know how you work

2354.099 --> 2359.2000000000003
five hours yeah but that's with the

2356.5 --> 2362.22
pre-show it was literally a three and a

2359.2 --> 2362.22
half hour live show

2363.339 --> 2369.04
it was three and a half hours live and

2365.74 --> 2371.9799999999996
the rest was recorded pre-show and after

2369.04 --> 2373.66
show because the actor showed kept

2371.98 --> 2376.18
freaking going

2373.66 --> 2377.98
at some point I just dropped

2376.18 --> 2380.5789999999997
I was just like I can't handle this

2377.98 --> 2380.579
anymore I

2381.28 --> 2384.0
it's too long

2390.7 --> 2393.2999999999997
right

2398.26 --> 2403.78
you're taught it as science

2400.66 --> 2406.7799999999997
right but hey I can be an ether

2403.78 --> 2407.98
representative I even offered it during

2406.78 --> 2410.8
that show

2407.98 --> 2413.079
and it was declined

2410.8 --> 2415.6600000000003
and I can do that

2413.079 --> 2418.0
I mean I can really do that and then

2415.66 --> 2419.68
they don't have to then you don't have

2418.0 --> 2421.54
to treat me like a baller because I'm

2419.68 --> 2426.24
just Baldwin and I'm just gonna lay down

2421.54 --> 2426.24
exactly what the aberration is

2426.64 --> 2430.42
that's it

2428.38 --> 2433.7200000000003
right and then in a way which it was

2430.42 --> 2436.1800000000003
also trying to lay out the aberration

2433.72 --> 2440.14
but he didn't really have a good firm

2436.18 --> 2444.5989999999997
grasp on it and so he just kept falling

2440.14 --> 2444.5989999999997
back into bubble tea Railroad

2470.44 --> 2473.44
what

2481.3 --> 2487.0600000000004
all right yeah well hey professor Phil

2484.3 --> 2489.46
Bell if you just keep complaining I

2487.06 --> 2491.5
don't understand why he does this yeah

2489.46 --> 2493.78
well if you if you don't pay attention

2491.5 --> 2495.28
then yeah why are you complaining you

2493.78 --> 2497.32
don't understand it because you're not

2495.28 --> 2500.46
paying attention

2497.32 --> 2500.46
that's your problem

2501.16 --> 2505.18
that's not Universal that's you not

2503.079 --> 2508.6800000000003
paying attention causing you to not

2505.18 --> 2508.68
understand do you see

2511.599 --> 2514.1400000000003
hmm

2516.7 --> 2522.72
[ __ ] is wrong with this door

2519.88 --> 2522.7200000000003
not

2531.579 --> 2534.8390000000004
hey gum nut man

2539.68 --> 2544.18
what's the topping uh well nothing super

2542.8 --> 2546.46
specific we've been talking about

2544.18 --> 2549.04
computers for some reason

2546.46 --> 2551.02
I guess because my mouse just turned out

2549.04 --> 2553.06
to work like brand new all of a sudden

2551.02 --> 2555.9
again

2553.06 --> 2555.9
that's it

2557.14 --> 2564.2999999999997
and reflecting of course on yesterday's

2559.74 --> 2564.2999999999997
record-long live fed show

2593.319 --> 2596.819
hello the most report

2607.0 --> 2612.72
do I see myself buying a new machine

2609.4 --> 2612.7200000000003
yeah hopefully

2613.78 --> 2620.3390000000004
I'm not gonna go with a laptop they're

2615.819 --> 2620.339
terrible they don't work for what I need

2634.18 --> 2637.2999999999997
right but for now I'll be doing just

2636.16 --> 2641.319
fine

2637.3 --> 2644.26
I mean I literally earlier this year

2641.319 --> 2645.88
had to switch my motherboard because it

2644.26 --> 2650.26
broke

2645.88 --> 2653.44
got a well relatively new one right now

2650.26 --> 2655.3590000000004
and a little this will do just fine for

2653.44 --> 2657.76
a very long time just like my old one

2655.359 --> 2660.5989999999997
did over a decade

2657.76 --> 2660.599
incredibly long

2660.76 --> 2664.96
right I mean literally the previous

2663.28 --> 2671.079
setup

2664.96 --> 2671.079
I built myself I assembled it in 2011.

2671.56 --> 2674.56
foreign

2685.24 --> 2690.72
yeah that's that's really nice for you

2687.16 --> 2690.72

2740.14 --> 2742.319
foreign

2764.53 --> 2769.42
[Music]

2767.079 --> 2771.099
I don't know what that exactly means I

2769.42 --> 2774.16
mean what what are you supposed to look

2771.099 --> 2778.6600000000003
like when you're 42.

2774.16 --> 2781.66
but I would say oh it's my

2778.66 --> 2784.1189999999997
sparing Indonesian jeans I got the

2781.66 --> 2785.2599999999998

2795.64 --> 2799.02
be like 50.

2802.9 --> 2808.7400000000002
or younger or 50 yeah

Goods if you could please tell that to

2811.96 --> 2817.38
us some women that I find attractive

2814.42 --> 2817.38

2817.78 --> 2821.619
now they know

2819.46 --> 2823.359
uh

2821.619 --> 2825.099
yeah the answer to the ultimate

2823.359 --> 2826.5989999999997
questions of life the universe and

2825.099 --> 2829.92

2859.42 --> 2863.819
he looks like he's aging but

2865.079 --> 2869.04

2889.78 --> 2893.099
Alternative Health and

2902.02 --> 2905.819
right thank you PGC net

2906.88 --> 2912.88
oh look I do not mind that I look like

that at all because I do actually still

2912.88 --> 2917.92
want children

2915.099 --> 2920.079
even though I'm I feel like I'm like

2917.92 --> 2922.54
getting too old for that [ __ ]

2920.079 --> 2924.78
but then again I'm a man so it's

2922.54 --> 2924.7799999999997
different

2927.46 --> 2933.819
but yeah it sounds weird maybe but I am

2931.66 --> 2936.04
looking for a younger wife like

2933.819 --> 2938.52
definitely younger

2936.04 --> 2938.52
sorry

2941.38 --> 2947.7000000000003
so I don't mind looking 10 years younger

2943.78 --> 2947.7000000000003
than I really do and I am

2956.92 --> 2960.96
oh okay government man what

2978.76 --> 2984.0600000000004
oh really Susie

2981.339 --> 2984.06
hmm

2987.16 --> 2991.66
really you thought I I was younger than

2989.8 --> 2994.1800000000003
you

2991.66 --> 2996.0989999999997
that is a real honor

2994.18 --> 2998.7999999999997
I mean you look great

2996.099 --> 3002.3590000000004
if your profile photo at least this is

2998.8 --> 3002.3590000000004
an honest indication

3014.339 --> 3020.7799999999997
how can you afford a wife

3017.099 --> 3020.78
yeah donate to my PayPal

3023.099 --> 3028.6800000000003
no that's not enough of course but yeah

3025.859 --> 3032.119
hey I'll get there when I get there

3028.68 --> 3032.1189999999997
right if I can get a connection

3032.339 --> 3035.24
then we'll see

3035.46 --> 3040.2
I mean

3037.26 --> 3042.619
you don't know what you got until you

3040.2 --> 3042.6189999999997
got it

3071.94 --> 3078.68
okay how can you afford to be a numpty

3075.48 --> 3078.68
[ __ ] sock troll

3078.9 --> 3085.4
how can you afford that

3081.3 --> 3085.4
how can you afford to act like that

3108.0 --> 3116.72
right okay Susie yeah you look great

3112.8 --> 3116.7200000000003
are you single by any chance

3147.119 --> 3153.859
Tech talk is easier than working

3149.94 --> 3153.859
right well look

3154.38 --> 3158.76
I am

3156.3 --> 3161.76
a media person

3158.76 --> 3161.76
unfortunately

3162.359 --> 3170.24
I've gotten to do

3165.3 --> 3170.2400000000002
right so yeah I mean

3170.46 --> 3176.04
there is possibilities there is there is

3173.94 --> 3178.38
just possibilities

3176.04 --> 3180.599
where what I can do where I can go with

3178.38 --> 3182.94
my skill

3180.599 --> 3185.3
and yeah there is potentially money to

3182.94 --> 3185.3
be made

3186.18 --> 3191.819
but right now this is what I'm doing I'm

3189.0 --> 3194.72
keeping it relatively simple so they can

3191.819 --> 3194.72
stay focused

3220.94 --> 3225.9
okay I think I may have embarrassed

3223.2 --> 3228.2599999999998
Susie as with a question sorry about

3225.9 --> 3228.26
that

3251.04 --> 3254.3
you're talking about

3262.92 --> 3268.2000000000003
right but anyway look

3266.04 --> 3270.72
depending on the circumstances in the

3268.2 --> 3273.1189999999997
world and the connections I have I could

3270.72 --> 3275.9399999999996
become literally a teacher

3273.119 --> 3278.28
like even if it's just like teaching

3275.94 --> 3282.78
courses of doing something or a certain

3278.28 --> 3286.099
skill like I can't technically do that

3282.78 --> 3286.099
if it was necessary

3287.76 --> 3295.44
so I know I have options I have skills I

3291.72 --> 3299.22
very high grade skills

3295.44 --> 3304.339
that are relatively rare

3299.22 --> 3304.339
and I know I would be able to get around

3309.72 --> 3313.04
if really necessary

3314.819 --> 3323.18
and yeah if I had a family then that

3319.02 --> 3323.18
necessity would definitely be there

3326.819 --> 3329.359
oh

3329.4 --> 3332.359
okay excuse me

3335.819 --> 3338.359
thank you

3339.54 --> 3344.46
at least of course many many people in

3342.24 --> 3346.5789999999997
India in English

3344.46 --> 3346.579
um

3348.98 --> 3357.2400000000002
right but turret there's a little issue

3353.16 --> 3359.339
though I don't speak Hindi yes

3357.24 --> 3361.7999999999997
so that's going to be an obstacle then

3359.339 --> 3363.18
because if you only understand the

3361.8 --> 3364.6800000000003
language that you're supposed to be

3363.18 --> 3369.5589999999997
teaching then

3364.68 --> 3369.5589999999997
how am I gonna help the transition

3392.099 --> 3398.52
oh okay hey turret okay yeah yeah I

3396.72 --> 3400.98
could definitely do that I don't know if

3398.52 --> 3403.02
I'd really get an income from that I'm

3400.98 --> 3407.48
just that but

3403.02 --> 3407.48
it's interesting I will keep it in mind

3431.28 --> 3436.579
oh okay classical homeopath huh

3446.22 --> 3450.5
yeah me me too LG

3457.98 --> 3461.64
no I wouldn't it's very simple I

3460.2 --> 3465.98
wouldn't

3461.64 --> 3465.98
I I'm no I'm not gonna do that

3468.599 --> 3474.059
I mean my girl doesn't have to be like a

3471.059 --> 3477.5400000000004
flatter the activist or anything but she

3474.059 --> 3480.1800000000003
definitely just needs to really get it

3477.54 --> 3483.14
because otherwise I will not be able to

3480.18 --> 3483.14
connect

3483.42 --> 3487.5
there will always be like going past

3485.76 --> 3490.6800000000003
each other and that's just never gonna

3487.5 --> 3493.319
work out that's always going to lead to

3490.68 --> 3494.22
either one usually the female trying to

3493.319 --> 3496.46
like

3494.22 --> 3499.0789999999997
eventually like

3496.46 --> 3500.28
manipulate and change you into what she

3499.079 --> 3503.48
wants

3500.28 --> 3503.48
I'm not gonna do that

3537.48 --> 3540.079
ah

3561.119 --> 3564.02
hmm

3567.78 --> 3572.099
is India much cheaper yeah no steamy

3570.839 --> 3574.5
traveler no

3572.099 --> 3576.42
yes it is but I don't want to go to

3574.5 --> 3581.099
India

3576.42 --> 3584.359
I don't like hot and moist

3581.099 --> 3584.3590000000004
I really don't

3584.46 --> 3587.119
uh

3587.46 --> 3593.2400000000002
but dude there might be other ways to do

3589.98 --> 3593.2400000000002
it through online

3602.28 --> 3604.8190000000004
hmm

3611.099 --> 3613.6400000000003
foreign

3629.9 --> 3635.1600000000003
yes guys yeah thanks for the tips and

3632.64 --> 3637.98
all that it I'll keep it in mind I mean

3635.16 --> 3640.2599999999998
I'm not doing any of that right now

3637.98 --> 3642.359
but I always realized that if I actually

3640.26 --> 3644.6400000000003
did want to like start a family at some

3642.359 --> 3646.92
point you're gonna have to

3644.64 --> 3650.0989999999997
you're really gonna have to get some

3646.92 --> 3652.46
kind of a a career going you just gotta

3650.099 --> 3652.46
do that

3655.68 --> 3660.2
you'll be terribly terribly sorry later

3664.98 --> 3668.819
yeah gross

3672.24 --> 3674.4799999999996
foreign

3692.839 --> 3699.7799999999997
nut man seriously I mean for like a week

3696.48 --> 3703.68
on holiday or something yeah sure but to

3699.78 --> 3707.099
literally live there or like an entire

3703.68 --> 3709.0789999999997
summer are you kidding me no even girls

3707.099 --> 3711.0
are gonna get very very sick of it

3709.079 --> 3712.619
unless they're Natives and they're just

3711.0 --> 3715.26
used to it

3712.619 --> 3718.579
and they might even get sick of it

3715.26 --> 3718.579
so yeah

3751.98 --> 3758.119
really dank

3753.599 --> 3758.119
really I think that's really gonna work

3776.46 --> 3782.7200000000003
I don't know my tactic would be to just

3778.92 --> 3782.7200000000003
break the matriarchy

3783.299 --> 3788.4
like I think that might have a much

3786.18 --> 3791.16
bigger impact than anybody might realize

3788.4 --> 3792.299
is that if a girl is all like oh girl

3791.16 --> 3794.64
power

3792.299 --> 3799.079
and then there's like a bunch of sjws

3794.64 --> 3802.5
there or whatever and and you really

3799.079 --> 3804.9
show them like like yeah you you don't

3802.5 --> 3806.099
have power over me

3804.9 --> 3808.5
I'm not

3806.099 --> 3810.1800000000003
your enemy though but like you don't

3808.5 --> 3811.799
have power of me and just put them in

3810.18 --> 3814.44
their place like when they're like

3811.799 --> 3816.72
puffing themselves up and then just like

3814.44 --> 3819.2400000000002
no

3816.72 --> 3822.66
without offending them without wanting

3819.24 --> 3824.7599999999998
to troll them very important leaving

3822.66 --> 3827.52
that element out that that means

3824.76 --> 3830.099
everything in that moment if you do that

3827.52 --> 3833.52
I think that the

3830.099 --> 3836.1600000000003
think that actually causes women to be

3833.52 --> 3840.599
very attracted to you

3836.16 --> 3844.799
by just not being a gamma troll every

3840.599 --> 3849.299
time because the entire world is filled

3844.799 --> 3850.92
with those so if you can actually live

3849.299 --> 3853.619
prove

3850.92 --> 3858.44
like in a face-to-face situation that

3853.619 --> 3860.28
you don't have compulsive gamma

3858.44 --> 3862.68
actions

3860.28 --> 3865.579
that is actually really attractive

3862.68 --> 3865.5789999999997
that's what I think

3869.46 --> 3875.2400000000002
I

3871.02 --> 3875.24
but I don't know I'm not a woman

3877.5 --> 3882.26
but my ex certainly did appreciate that

3882.72 --> 3887.8799999999997
it's just when you step up to the plate

3884.579 --> 3890.1600000000003
and just claim your manhood over women

3887.88 --> 3892.6800000000003
but not like a freaking pimp or

3890.16 --> 3896.2799999999997
something but just like no it's just

3892.68 --> 3899.2799999999997
this is the natural order

3896.28 --> 3901.8190000000004
and its responsibility

3899.28 --> 3901.8190000000004
anyway

3906.599 --> 3911.839
are you joking behind my back in my face

3913.44 --> 3917.04
oh wait now you're still referencing

3915.18 --> 3920.72
thanks

3917.04 --> 3920.72
pure blood t-shirt comment

3929.819 --> 3936.68
yeah confidence but also the ability to

3933.839 --> 3936.68
be steadfast

3937.859 --> 3944.0989999999997
and to have

3940.559 --> 3946.7000000000003
like infinite patience when it's

3944.099 --> 3946.7000000000003
necessary

3946.799 --> 3954.42
so it's like the ultimate combination of

3949.98 --> 3954.42
like perfect patience and

3956.52 --> 3963.299
being extremely Resolute without doubt

3960.9 --> 3965.6600000000003
and combine that that's like the perfect

3963.299 --> 3965.66
thing

3966.119 --> 3970.079
anyway

3967.92 --> 3972.48
but yeah that pretty much comes down to

3970.079 --> 3975.2000000000003
confidence that's what it it feels like

3972.48 --> 3975.2
to others

3976.079 --> 3978.6800000000003
right

3986.4 --> 3990.7200000000003
right but it's but it's if it's just a

3988.98 --> 3992.7
show of dominance like Como virus that's

3990.72 --> 3995.4199999999996
not the same thing because

3992.7 --> 3999.8999999999996
you can dominate over somebody else

3995.42 --> 4002.2400000000002
without like showing off or like acting

3999.9 --> 4003.559
like a gorilla about it

4002.24 --> 4005.9599999999996
right

4003.559 --> 4007.8190000000004
that would be like pure dominance but

4005.96 --> 4009.859
that's very Earthly that's not very

4007.819 --> 4012.5589999999997
intellect it's not very spiritual to do

4009.859 --> 4015.2
that but you can dominate by literally

4012.559 --> 4016.579
being untouched being better being

4015.2 --> 4020.299
correcting

4016.579 --> 4021.98
but not like seeing yourself as being

4020.299 --> 4026.44
all the [ __ ]

4021.98 --> 4026.44
in relation to the others

4026.539 --> 4033.3390000000004
like being better but without just like

4029.599 --> 4033.339
trying to show off with it

4033.38 --> 4035.92
anyway

4036.2 --> 4038.3799999999997
foreign

4039.799 --> 4044.66
I spent a lot of energy really trying to

4043.039 --> 4046.7000000000003
impress my ex

4044.66 --> 4048.92
all the time

4046.7 --> 4051.0989999999997
I was so incredibly in love with that

4048.92 --> 4051.099
woman

4092.42 --> 4095.14
hmm

4113.96 --> 4118.58
right yeah good Vision also yeah of

4116.719 --> 4121.66
course but did you how can you be a

4118.58 --> 4124.4
Resolute and all that without a solid

4121.66 --> 4127.759
Vision you know

4124.4 --> 4129.8589999999995
what is going to be guiding you well if

4127.759 --> 4132.02
not a vision than a methodology and a

4129.859 --> 4133.88
methodology when dominating leads to

4132.02 --> 4136.759
Guerrilla Behavior

4133.88 --> 4138.5
so you don't really have much choice

4136.759 --> 4139.94
you don't have a vision you don't have

4138.5 --> 4142.759
anything

4139.94 --> 4145.54
you don't have that natural Authority

4142.759 --> 4145.54
without it

4157.699 --> 4163.96
deck scissors dude what the [ __ ] are you

4160.64 --> 4163.96
talking about gumnut man

4164.6 --> 4171.08
I'm just referencing to

4167.839 --> 4173.5599999999995
well the last romantic interaction that

4171.08 --> 4173.5599999999995
I've had

4173.779 --> 4176.96
which was extremely serious to me at the

4176.179 --> 4180.08
time

4176.96 --> 4183.679
why do you say I'm not over her I'm just

4180.08 --> 4185.98
I mean look I haven't even seen her in

4183.679 --> 4185.9800000000005
like

4186.739 --> 4189.58
10 years

4190.819 --> 4194.54
nine years

4192.62 --> 4197.199
I mean she probably doesn't even look

4194.54 --> 4197.199
the same now

4197.36 --> 4203.199
I think she completely overhauled her

4199.64 --> 4203.1990000000005
appearance after we broke up

4216.5 --> 4221.96
so yeah yeah I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm

4219.32 --> 4223.46
going to be referencing my ex sometimes

4221.96 --> 4225.44
yeah

4223.46 --> 4227.2390000000005
right because

4225.44 --> 4229.82
yeah that was a very influential

4227.239 --> 4232.4
situation in my life

4229.82 --> 4235.84
means the first woman I've ever lived

4232.4 --> 4235.839999999999
with for three years

4236.36 --> 4240.699
straight yeah first go three years

4240.98 --> 4247.218999999999
it was extremely influential the whole

4243.44 --> 4249.199
thing was very influential we had a dark

4247.219 --> 4251.42
world connection

4249.199 --> 4253.639999999999
weirdly enough

4251.42 --> 4256.06
turned out it was just in the wrong type

4253.64 --> 4256.06
of way

4274.82 --> 4277.36
foreign

4322.88 --> 4328.54
it not over it you mean me I'm not over

4326.36 --> 4328.54
it

4329.54 --> 4335.96
look what's the point gun gum nut man I

4332.84 --> 4337.54
thought about this a lot yeah I've had a

4335.96 --> 4340.34
decade

4337.54 --> 4342.98
okay okay

4340.34 --> 4345.9400000000005
are we communicating here a decade yeah

4342.98 --> 4345.94
a decade

4346.1 --> 4350.6
I thought about it a lot

4348.14 --> 4352.820000000001
there is no logical way that we could

4350.6 --> 4355.34
even get back together again

4352.82 --> 4357.259999999999
and that it would be just like before it

4355.34 --> 4359.3
would never reach that same level

4357.26 --> 4360.4400000000005
because of certain things that she's

4359.3 --> 4363.04
done

4360.44 --> 4363.04
you understand

4364.699 --> 4372.219
I'm being a realist about it but it did

4367.58 --> 4372.219
have a massive impact on my life

4374.9 --> 4381.259999999999
foreign

4376.96 --> 4383.659
she did confront me with a lot of inner

4381.26 --> 4386.900000000001
things that I've never shown anybody

4383.659 --> 4390.0199999999995
ever not even my own parents

4386.9 --> 4392.659
okay I really tried to go all the way

4390.02 --> 4395.719
into the depths with her I wanted her to

4392.659 --> 4398.48
be my permanent wife and mother of my

4395.719 --> 4400.94
children I just she just refused and it

4398.48 --> 4403.78
seems like she's been entangled

4400.94 --> 4407.0199999999995
in some really [ __ ] up

4403.78 --> 4407.0199999999995
overt [ __ ]

4407.36 --> 4412.099999999999
not saying like a secret service or

4409.4 --> 4414.5599999999995
anything but just dark circles he had

4412.1 --> 4416.96
touched dark dark circles and dark

4414.56 --> 4420.219
circles don't leave you alone even if

4416.96 --> 4420.219
you're not like that

4430.4 --> 4436.099999999999
and I'm pretty certain that she probably

4433.34 --> 4438.08
partially thanks to me is trying to

4436.1 --> 4440.4800000000005
really stay out of that

4438.08 --> 4444.699
I hope she is because it would probably

4440.48 --> 4444.699
be over very quickly if you wouldn't

4452.9 --> 4458.659
I mean if we had never met then she

4456.02 --> 4463.360000000001
might just be like one of these vaccine

4458.659 --> 4463.36
pushing doctors now not even joking

4463.46 --> 4468.699
she might have become that if we hadn't

4465.86 --> 4468.699
had a relationship

4472.28 --> 4478.699
because I pushed her I showed her the

4475.52 --> 4480.92
alternative medical world I showed her

4478.699 --> 4483.86
issues

4480.92 --> 4488.08
I showed her about holistic medicine and

4483.86 --> 4488.08
she assimilated it she made it her own

4496.4 --> 4500.839999999999
right so yeah it's so it's been very

4499.1 --> 4503.900000000001
influential that doesn't mean that I'm

4500.84 --> 4507.76
not over her I'm over her because I know

4503.9 --> 4507.759999999999
that it's never going to be the same

4509.32 --> 4515.48
like this spell is broken the love spell

4512.3 --> 4516.860000000001
is broken on my side I never thought

4515.48 --> 4518.239
that was even the thing that would be

4516.86 --> 4522.08
possible

4518.239 --> 4524.379999999999
but it just happened it took a very long

4522.08 --> 4524.38
time

4525.08 --> 4528.4
like six years

4528.739 --> 4534.339999999999
which is logical because I had a

4530.719 --> 4534.34
relationship with her for three years

4535.58 --> 4538.94
and yeah

4537.14 --> 4542.12
like

4538.94 --> 4544.28
five years ago I was still quite

4542.12 --> 4546.5599999999995
obsessed with her and like thinking

4544.28 --> 4550.5199999999995
about her like oh I wish we were still

4546.56 --> 4554.0
together yeah I don't have that anymore

4550.52 --> 4559.179
so you don't have to worry about me not

4554.0 --> 4559.179
being over my ex okay gum nut man

4562.88 --> 4569.02
because of what she did to me yeah yeah

4565.46 --> 4569.02
she did some terrible things

4569.3 --> 4572.02
terrible

4572.659 --> 4575.379999999999
evil

4576.02 --> 4581.6
but it might Simply Be break up evil but

4579.14 --> 4584.900000000001
that's still just too far she literally

4581.6 --> 4587.780000000001
cut the the line

4584.9 --> 4589.94
she basically said for herself like

4587.78 --> 4594.5599999999995
decided like we're never gonna hook up

4589.94 --> 4597.699
again so she severed it actively through

4594.56 --> 4597.6990000000005
an act of evil

4603.32 --> 4608.259999999999
yeah so I think that's enough now

4608.6 --> 4613.64
right I don't even know why I'm sharing

4611.659 --> 4616.099999999999
all this [ __ ] with you

4613.64 --> 4618.400000000001
besides that I'm just really open about

4616.1 --> 4618.400000000001
everything

4620.6 --> 4622.780000000001
foreign

4632.48 --> 4635.98
are you talking about

4639.739 --> 4644.54
talking about confidence issues why

4642.02 --> 4646.400000000001
don't you stop projecting your [ __ ] onto

4644.54 --> 4648.44
me dude

4646.4 --> 4650.0599999999995
she cheated on me yeah

4648.44 --> 4653.239
yeah

4650.06 --> 4655.76
yeah my ex probably did too I I'm never

4653.239 --> 4659.54
gonna technically find out

4655.76 --> 4661.76
and at the time I was like I don't care

4659.54 --> 4664.4
well I did care but like in that moment

4661.76 --> 4666.5
I don't care it was just like okay

4664.4 --> 4668.659
if you really need to do something like

4666.5 --> 4671.179
that

4668.659 --> 4676.299999999999
I prefer that it would not lead to you

4671.179 --> 4676.3
holding back information from me

4676.88 --> 4683.5
but she never did come clean but I could

4679.52 --> 4683.5
feel that she did she had done that

4685.52 --> 4689.540000000001
yeah

4687.92 --> 4691.58
but that was probably always going to

4689.54 --> 4694.58
happen because she is just

4691.58 --> 4697.34
well she's an infomaniac she's sex

4694.58 --> 4699.5199999999995
addicted it was always gonna happen like

4697.34 --> 4699.52
that

4715.34 --> 4720.860000000001
right so I have no proof and it's

4717.38 --> 4723.14
nobody's [ __ ] business anyway

4720.86 --> 4725.36
nobody knows what she looks like nobody

4723.14 --> 4730.659000000001
knows her name I'm gonna skip it that

4725.36 --> 4730.659
way because she deserves private life

4740.78 --> 4745.88
trying to encourage me what thanks God

4743.84 --> 4748.159000000001
not man but you don't really need to do

4745.88 --> 4750.56
that and by the way telling me you're

4748.159 --> 4752.839999999999
not over her it's not exactly

4750.56 --> 4755.84
encouragement if you know what I mean

4752.84 --> 4758.6
that's not very encouraging thing to say

4755.84 --> 4760.78
just saying

4758.6 --> 4760.780000000001
foreign

4789.98 --> 4797.32
just picking up what's put down

4794.06 --> 4797.320000000001
is that metaphorical

4797.84 --> 4802.400000000001
are you talking about me

4800.3 --> 4805.58
or are you talking about the information

4802.4 --> 4806.96
you caught that you that led up to you

4805.58 --> 4808.58
saying that

4806.96 --> 4811.04
kind of the

4808.58 --> 4814.9
double branches

4811.04 --> 4814.9
meaning there gum nut man

4821.42 --> 4826.4800000000005
wow flutter said yeah that is that is

4823.82 --> 4826.48
just [ __ ] up

4827.179 --> 4829.4800000000005
foreign

4851.239 --> 4855.739
yeah that's great territory you told us

4853.58 --> 4857.54
before I have this awesome great that

4855.739 --> 4858.678999999999
your grandma's like really gotten into

4857.54 --> 4861.5199999999995
that

4858.679 --> 4861.52
Epic

4872.84 --> 4877.28
all right but look

4875.06 --> 4878.96
I don't know it's nobody's [ __ ]

4877.28 --> 4881.0
business I need to stop talking about

4878.96 --> 4883.52
her

4881.0 --> 4886.58
I just wanted to sort a Defender I mean

4883.52 --> 4890.540000000001
she was not like

4886.58 --> 4893.12
a bad or like unbalanced crazy person

4890.54 --> 4896.0
she was an infomaniac

4893.12 --> 4898.699
but not even like completely out as if

4896.0 --> 4901.159
it's just like accident just like that

4898.699 --> 4905.419999999999
and there is consequences of that

4901.159 --> 4908.0
you become kind of a jumper you you like

4905.42 --> 4910.82
yeah the same guy over and over again

4908.0 --> 4913.82
it's gonna get boring even if they're

4910.82 --> 4917.0599999999995
really good at what they do and I am

4913.82 --> 4918.739
really good trust me on this well you

4917.06 --> 4922.46
don't have to I don't care I'm really

4918.739 --> 4924.98
good I know I am I can use my energy

4922.46 --> 4928.219
at KU is no magnetization it can use

4924.98 --> 4931.04
every freaking energy spirit Power I

4928.219 --> 4933.199
have with romance and I do very

4931.04 --> 4936.14
carefully

4933.199 --> 4938.12
and effectively but even that gets

4936.14 --> 4940.219
boring to an infomaniac they can't help

4938.12 --> 4942.98
it because it's about the rush it's

4940.219 --> 4946.52
about the rush of just feeling an end

4942.98 --> 4949.599999999999
like an animal and just doing that and

4946.52 --> 4949.6
yeah eventually

4952.4 --> 4956.48
she just like

4954.5 --> 4959.08
did that

4956.48 --> 4959.08
I think

4961.219 --> 4964.699
or maybe she didn't even do that and

4963.44 --> 4968.139999999999
just

4964.699 --> 4968.139999999999
did it in her head

4968.179 --> 4971.78
which is pretty much the same to me I

4970.58 --> 4973.5199999999995
mean if you're going to be thinking

4971.78 --> 4976.759999999999
about cheating all the time how is that

4973.52 --> 4978.8
different from actually doing it

4976.76 --> 4980.84
it means there is

4978.8 --> 4985.42
the connections not working anymore

4980.84 --> 4985.42
between you that's it's that symbol

4988.94 --> 4993.879999999999
it really happens to me last night what

5013.54 --> 5018.219
what are you talking about right back

5015.64 --> 5022.360000000001
are you all right

5018.219 --> 5027.06
seems like there is a live show

5022.36 --> 5027.0599999999995
on fpd in half an hour cool

5030.1 --> 5033.0
hence what

5035.98 --> 5040.718999999999
oh [ __ ]

5038.5 --> 5042.9
that you just have a major bill or

5040.719 --> 5042.9
something

5043.0 --> 5045.9
that sucks

5063.52 --> 5068.92
teaching is such a low act yeah but it's

5065.8 --> 5071.02
also just an act of disinterest

5068.92 --> 5073.9
right

5071.02 --> 5075.46
if you're in love with somebody you

5073.9 --> 5077.679
cannot cheat on them

5075.46 --> 5079.54
that you how would you

5077.679 --> 5081.64
like unless you were like a really

5079.54 --> 5084.9
spiteful [ __ ] and you're like oh I'm

5081.64 --> 5087.400000000001
gonna make my man jealous

5084.9 --> 5090.759999999999
well if you're as a man into that you

5087.4 --> 5092.5599999999995
got a problem what

5090.76 --> 5094.06
as soon as somebody's cheating it just

5092.56 --> 5096.9400000000005
means that they're a losing interest

5094.06 --> 5098.92
it's that simple it doesn't matter what

5096.94 --> 5102.12
they say about it

5098.92 --> 5102.12
that's what it is

5107.679 --> 5112.2390000000005
but it's also just technically

5109.84 --> 5114.1
despicable and especially if you're

5112.239 --> 5117.178999999999
married and have children then it's

5114.1 --> 5117.179
truly horrific

5134.86 --> 5139.38
what happened right back what's going on

5168.1 --> 5170.92
um well PG scene I wouldn't say it's

5170.08 --> 5173.38
common

5170.92 --> 5176.38
it's just being normalized they're

5173.38 --> 5179.62
trying to normalize it

5176.38 --> 5182.28
through porn and through

5179.62 --> 5182.28
like

5182.44 --> 5189.339999999999
family sitcom [ __ ] it's normalization

5186.34 --> 5191.38
but it isn't normal like it's really not

5189.34 --> 5192.88
that normal it's just there's a lot of

5191.38 --> 5196.12
people that have really stupid

5192.88 --> 5197.5
superficial relationships

5196.12 --> 5199.599999999999
and if you have a really stupid

5197.5 --> 5201.28
superficial relationship you don't

5199.6 --> 5203.92
really give a [ __ ] about the one you're

5201.28 --> 5205.48
with and then yeah cheating is is just

5203.92 --> 5210.6
like branching out

5205.48 --> 5210.599999999999
dear you know it's not the same though

5211.12 --> 5215.5199999999995
but yeah you can have an asymmetrical

5213.1 --> 5218.8
relationship where for example the girl

5215.52 --> 5220.659000000001
really loves the guy and thinks like oh

5218.8 --> 5222.219
this is what I'm gonna marry and then

5220.659 --> 5225.04
the guy's just like oh I think she's

5222.219 --> 5228.659
really hot for now yeah then you get

5225.04 --> 5228.659
really asymmetrical situations

5229.179 --> 5233.639
it sucks sucks when that happens

5255.04 --> 5260.5
you're good gorilla bang

5257.88 --> 5263.56
okay clutch

5260.5 --> 5266.82
I I agree though

5263.56 --> 5266.820000000001
I mean yeah

5267.04 --> 5270.9
I can be a bit of a gorilla

5274.48 --> 5280.659
it's like you just start to use

5278.139 --> 5284.04
these this muscle range in a very

5280.659 --> 5284.04
specific way just

5300.0 --> 5308.46
gorilla or a tiger or whatever

5304.96 --> 5308.46
you want to think of me

5317.1 --> 5320.58
don't keep it

5321.82 --> 5326.34
okay Eric back thank you for that

5326.8 --> 5331.2390000000005
uh really

5329.02 --> 5333.659000000001
is it really that small

5331.239 --> 5333.659
wow

5338.199 --> 5341.86
I am astounded

5344.32 --> 5346.44
thank you

5360.34 --> 5363.34
okay

5364.36 --> 5367.08
rice

5371.739 --> 5377.32
I guess that all the animal the animal

5373.9 --> 5379.839999999999
kingdom does on average have a problem

5377.32 --> 5380.86
I mean cats have spiked penises

5379.84 --> 5384.12
apparently

5380.86 --> 5384.12
feline types

5384.4 --> 5391.179
animals have like really weird

5388.0 --> 5395.4
sexual system sometimes

5391.179 --> 5395.4
just look at Ducks that's just crazy

5396.28 --> 5400.239
I mean nobody knows that even about

5398.32 --> 5401.98
ducks

5400.239 --> 5405.82
that they like have like the biggest

5401.98 --> 5408.4
body size penis size ratio of pretty

5405.82 --> 5410.259999999999
much every animal in the world

5408.4 --> 5411.94
laughs

5410.26 --> 5414.6990000000005
yeah

5411.94 --> 5418.12
I heard that from Owen Benjamin

5414.699 --> 5420.839999999999
I've never actually seen it

5418.12 --> 5420.84
uh

5421.0 --> 5425.58
but I didn't know that about gorillas

5422.8 --> 5425.58
that's hilarious

5432.699 --> 5435.82
it does make a little bit more sense

5434.5 --> 5438.9
though

5435.82 --> 5441.46
so they're just hyper beefed up

5438.9 --> 5444.46
testosterone got huge muscles but they

5441.46 --> 5446.679
got a tiny tiny little penis while no

5444.46 --> 5449.56
wonder they're so freaking frustrated

5446.679 --> 5451.6
and dominant all the time I mean they

5449.56 --> 5454.0
like bloated with testosterone but it

5451.6 --> 5457.38
got a freaking tiny penis yeah wouldn't

5454.0 --> 5457.38
you be like that too

5458.679 --> 5465.34
and I guess that some people kind of are

5462.639 --> 5469.7390000000005
when they get on all the uh

5465.34 --> 5469.7390000000005
muscle enhancing drugs and [ __ ]

5482.199 --> 5488.379999999999
your blogs are letting girls down so the

5485.44 --> 5489.879999999999
girls are confused what blogs mean meant

5488.38 --> 5492.58
to do right

5489.88 --> 5494.38
yeah yeah that's right gum nut man if

5492.58 --> 5496.12
every girl

5494.38 --> 5498.400000000001
when they first are like oh I'm gonna

5496.12 --> 5502.0599999999995
try a man oh I think he's cute and they

5498.4 --> 5506.58
all act like complete [ __ ] and Gammas

5502.06 --> 5506.580000000001
yeah no [ __ ] you're gonna get confused

5507.1 --> 5510.219
I mean if they all act like that and

5509.26 --> 5513.159000000001
they're like

5510.219 --> 5515.56
is acting like a gamma and a [ __ ] and

5513.159 --> 5517.54
then you're like and then there's other

5515.56 --> 5519.34
guys there'd be like oh yeah yeah yeah

5517.54 --> 5522.639
then you're gonna be like what the [ __ ]

5519.34 --> 5523.6
you're all like that is that is this a

5522.639 --> 5525.6990000000005
man

5523.6 --> 5530.26
yeah that's going to be the question for

5525.699 --> 5532.86
you as a as a woman is this a man

5530.26 --> 5532.860000000001
terrible

5546.76 --> 5551.92
right but the the mo the main real

5549.94 --> 5554.32
problem

5551.92 --> 5558.1
is with dating in general I think things

5554.32 --> 5559.299999999999
is universal is that men are just

5558.1 --> 5561.88
starting

5559.3 --> 5563.92
maybe in a response but it's always been

5561.88 --> 5565.32
the tendency has been there

5563.92 --> 5567.76
to just

5565.32 --> 5571.239
normalize treating women like furniture

5567.76 --> 5573.34
or like sex objects it's always been

5571.239 --> 5577.5599999999995
some issues with that but it's like

5573.34 --> 5577.56
almost like being promoted now

5578.739 --> 5583.54
to just treat women like Commodities and

5582.1 --> 5585.58
yeah if you treat a woman like a

5583.54 --> 5589.6
commodity they're going to be

5585.58 --> 5592.92
like very disappointed and let down and

5589.6 --> 5592.92
depleted eventually

5594.28 --> 5600.12
and broke

5596.5 --> 5600.12
they hang around that too long

5615.699 --> 5620.86
okay

5618.4 --> 5623.339999999999
are you sure about that is she really

5620.86 --> 5623.339999999999
that great

5656.92 --> 5660.9400000000005
ah

5659.139 --> 5664.96
okay

5660.94 --> 5668.739
so today's show is about computers

5664.96 --> 5671.7390000000005
and dating girls

5668.739 --> 5675.28
and issues with relationships

5671.739 --> 5678.54
what an odd combination of a show

5675.28 --> 5678.54
guess it is what it is

5695.98 --> 5704.099999999999
oh right it just read that backflatter

5699.52 --> 5704.1
said yeah yeah if yeah that can happen

5706.48 --> 5712.0
if you're just too busy being young and

5709.36 --> 5714.179
reckless Reckless then yeah that's also

5712.0 --> 5714.179
gonna

5714.4 --> 5718.839999999999
be a sign of course that hey you're not

5717.159 --> 5722.04

5874.659 --> 5879.46
talk for like longer than two seconds it

5876.94 --> 5882.879999999999
makes me want to throw up

5879.46 --> 5884.92
so I don't know did they make any sense

5882.88 --> 5887.28
I've never been able to actually watch

5884.92 --> 5887.28
one

5904.6 --> 5907.84
okay we're here for like five minutes

5906.52 --> 5911.280000000001

5907.84 --> 5911.28

5911.98 --> 5917.739
at least a day is just everything is

5914.08 --> 5920.04

5917.739 --> 5922.48

5925.659 --> 5929.099999999999
I'm feel sick because of it

5966.34 --> 5971.8
it's funny straight visit that's it yeah

5970.42 --> 5974.32
sure

5971.8 --> 5976.06
did you see that one video though

5974.32 --> 5978.82
I saw

5976.06 --> 5983.02
oh God right back

5978.82 --> 5984.58
it's some overly popularized dick

5983.02 --> 5986.080000000001
from

5984.58 --> 5989.94
what is it

5986.08 --> 5992.98
some Eastern Europe what's it like

5989.94 --> 5994.659
Hungarian or something I don't know

5992.98 --> 5995.98
it's from all the way over there and

5994.659 --> 5999.879999999999
he's like

5995.98 --> 6002.28
really popularized now with young men

5999.88 --> 6005.46
and all that [ __ ]

6002.28 --> 6009.0
he's everywhere saw him up Alex Jones

6005.46 --> 6012.96
we're like half a year ago even

6009.0 --> 6016.219
and ugh just bumping into that

6012.96 --> 6016.219
man everywhere

6016.32 --> 6019.82
Romania sorry yeah

6020.1 --> 6023.4800000000005
the bald guy yes

6024.239 --> 6030.5599999999995
but this it is stupid accent it makes no

6027.84 --> 6030.56
freaking sense

6031.56 --> 6036.6
there was one really funny short that I

6034.62 --> 6038.58
noticed I should have probably saved it

6036.6 --> 6040.860000000001
but yeah sometimes I just scroll through

6038.58 --> 6042.12
that [ __ ] like a zombie and I sometimes

6040.86 --> 6044.58
do that

6042.12 --> 6046.5
but there was this one short

6044.58 --> 6050.34
where he was basically bragging about

6046.5 --> 6052.32
like being badass man and all that

6050.34 --> 6055.26
and then there was a video of him

6052.32 --> 6057.78
basically walking like he had just like

6055.26 --> 6060.659000000001
walking in the street like he had just

6057.78 --> 6061.739
been very severely butt [ __ ] or

6060.659 --> 6064.679
something

6061.739 --> 6067.5199999999995
and with a bunch of guys like laughing

6064.679 --> 6067.52
about that because

6067.679 --> 6077.58
dude you don't want to know the guy

6071.58 --> 6080.46
probably has a a crazy crazy Secret Life

6077.58 --> 6085.04
this is my Armenian prediction I think

6080.46 --> 6085.04
the guy has a crazy crazy Secret Life

6085.98 --> 6090.659
no proof of this only a feeling and well

6088.739 --> 6093.178999999999
that clip that's that reveals something

6090.659 --> 6095.4
like wow

6093.179 --> 6098.159
you seen the walk

6095.4 --> 6099.54
you've seen that video what's out there

6098.159 --> 6102.659

6102.659 --> 6109.4
into one of his shorts

6104.94 --> 6109.4

6140.46 --> 6144.42
inspiration

6142.92 --> 6146.46

6144.42 --> 6149.52
