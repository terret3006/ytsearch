95.52 --> 99.52
button

96.479 --> 100.64
that would be much appreciated

99.52 --> 101.92
so

100.64 --> 103.84
and the weather

101.92 --> 108.07900000000001
today is

103.84 --> 110.0
similar to yesterday less clouds but

108.079 --> 113.67999999999999
this time

110.0 --> 116.799
seems to be a bit of spraying going up

113.68 --> 116.799
going on up there

117.52 --> 123.28
huh look at that sight fluffy little

120.0 --> 125.28
cloud very close by flying by really

123.28 --> 126.07900000000001
fast that one little cloud

125.28 --> 128.64000000000001
with

126.079 --> 132.56
other sheep clouds hanging right where

128.64 --> 134.16
they are way up there behind it see that

132.56 --> 137.36
i don't know if the camera

134.16 --> 139.68
you should be able to see that

137.36 --> 141.36
this one little cloud just drifting away

139.68 --> 144.87900000000002
to the left

141.36 --> 144.87900000000002
while the rest is standing still

146.16 --> 150.56
anyway yeah there's spraying going on

151.519 --> 154.959
there wasn't any yesterday so i don't

153.2 --> 158.16
know why they turned

154.959 --> 158.16
yeah i started doing that

161.2 --> 165.44
so yeah it's probably going to be a

162.64 --> 169.23899999999998
little bit hazy

165.44 --> 169.239
later on in the day

170.319 --> 173.04
but

171.12 --> 175.20000000000002
yeah other than that

173.04 --> 178.64
in between there's still blue sky and

175.2 --> 178.64
yeah the sun is coming through

180.159 --> 185.84
seems to be a bit of

182.4 --> 185.84
wind going on

188.4 --> 190.72
all right

196.84 --> 199.84
yo

198.8 --> 201.12
hello

199.84 --> 201.84
elise

201.12 --> 204.64000000000001
g

201.84 --> 207.68
first in chat

204.64 --> 210.07999999999998
i'm i'm gonna try to just say elise i i

207.68 --> 213.44
don't know why i started calling you

210.08 --> 215.20000000000002
isles i don't know why

213.44 --> 217.68
because i think it is supposed to be

215.2 --> 217.67999999999998
illes

217.92 --> 220.319
anyway

220.4 --> 224.48000000000002
plunder 23 hello

225.64 --> 231.76
1074. yeah i know that's quite a few

228.959 --> 231.76
shows isn't it

236.799 --> 244.15900000000002
been spot in the spring

240.48 --> 246.07999999999998
yeah i know what you mean it's not

244.159 --> 248.07999999999998
not great

246.08 --> 250.0
with days like yesterday you kind of

248.08 --> 252.4
think like maybe they've just finally

250.0 --> 255.76
stopped doing that entirely

252.4 --> 258.23900000000003
but no no today they're they're going at

255.76 --> 258.239
it again

264.32 --> 269.84
saw loads in front of the moon really

266.479 --> 271.52
you saw trails

269.84 --> 274.23999999999995
in front of the moon

271.52 --> 274.24
that's weird

280.88 --> 286.8
i don't think i've ever like distinctly

283.68 --> 286.8
seen that

287.68 --> 291.28000000000003
but yeah the the moon was out

291.36 --> 296.16
like i think it's been full a couple of

293.759 --> 298.56
days ago

296.16 --> 301.44
and it's now

298.56 --> 301.44
shrinking again

302.56 --> 308.039
moonlight shows them up

305.039 --> 308.039
hmm

310.56 --> 316.199
hello old house rod down

312.8 --> 316.199
rod born

325.759 --> 331.12
you can tell it's chemical by the what

331.84 --> 335.75899999999996
no

333.199 --> 336.96000000000004
not really plunder to any you can tell

335.759 --> 339.28000000000003
it's not

336.96 --> 342.0
water vapor

339.28 --> 342.0
that's about it

342.32 --> 349.28
right water vapor yeah it dissolves

346.0 --> 351.84
after a while that's why it's a contrail

349.28 --> 354.08
and then yeah the plane goes it leaves a

351.84 --> 356.15999999999997
trail and then that trill dissipates

354.08 --> 359.35999999999996
quickly that's a

356.16 --> 360.639
contrail condensation trill

359.36 --> 363.039
and if it

360.639 --> 365.6
doesn't dissolve and it kind of spreads

363.039 --> 367.36
out like a feather then it's not water

365.6 --> 368.40000000000003
that's about it you don't know what it

367.36 --> 370.8
is you

368.4 --> 372.71999999999997
definitely don't know if it's like a

370.8 --> 375.68
reactive chemical

372.72 --> 375.68
you can't tell that

376.319 --> 382.47900000000004
you'd have to actually sample it to know

380.319 --> 384.56
moon is full tomorrow

382.479 --> 386.56
oh

384.56 --> 389.039
that's weird i thought it was already

386.56 --> 391.039
full moon it had already been but i

389.039 --> 393.12
guess

391.039 --> 394.639
i had that wrong

393.12 --> 398.08
so it's going to be full tomorrow you

394.639 --> 398.08
say jim smith all right

399.28 --> 402.55999999999995
aluminium dust

403.12 --> 406.72
they admitted it no

405.6 --> 410.96000000000004
no

406.72 --> 410.96000000000004
that's that doesn't work that way

411.919 --> 421.96
it's been admitted to be utilized in

415.8 --> 421.96000000000004
geoengineering tests in the test phase

422.08 --> 426.31899999999996
but

424.08 --> 430.15999999999997
yeah you could draw existential

426.319 --> 432.639
conclusion that they're still doing that

430.16 --> 434.319
due to further lack of detailed

432.639 --> 436.319
information about it

434.319 --> 439.36
but you don't know exactly what they're

436.319 --> 439.36
spraying right now

441.44 --> 446.0
not with certainty and until you

443.68 --> 448.24
actually start taking samples again you

446.0 --> 448.24
see

449.28 --> 455.11999999999995
i mean it could be

451.68 --> 455.12
but you don't know for sure

455.84 --> 461.11999999999995
like the substances they use for that

458.319 --> 463.599
sort of ordeal the geo engineering yeah

461.12 --> 465.199
they could be changing

463.599 --> 467.199
and yet since

465.199 --> 469.44
they're not like

467.199 --> 471.199
giving their daily geoengineering

469.44 --> 472.96
announcements of exactly what they're

471.199 --> 475.199
doing on the news or something or the

472.96 --> 478.75899999999996
weather report you don't know what

475.199 --> 478.759
they're doing exactly

480.4 --> 485.75899999999996
that's why i just call it trails

484.08 --> 488.08
i don't call it chemtrails anymore

485.759 --> 491.52000000000004
because i don't know if it's chemicals

488.08 --> 494.08
like that it could for all i know

491.52 --> 496.479
it could be fine dust

494.08 --> 499.12
just sand silicon

496.479 --> 499.12
i don't know

502.479 --> 507.75899999999996
what i do know it's not dissolving in

504.72 --> 509.91900000000004
the air so it can't be moist it's

507.759 --> 513.12
probably some solid

509.919 --> 516.12
dust of some kind but i don't know what

513.12 --> 516.12
type

529.6 --> 534.0
yeah i know ultra hoss ratborn

536.8 --> 543.3599999999999
i remember the aluminium

539.12 --> 543.36
dust and the barium salts

545.279 --> 553.2
right that's what was kind of discovered

548.8 --> 553.1999999999999
with the chemtrails early on like

553.44 --> 557.12
15 years ago roughly

558.64 --> 563.279
although it started in 95 i think

561.76 --> 568.04
that's when they really started doing

563.279 --> 568.04
that started to roll out the program

583.76 --> 591.8389999999999
i've watched them form in the clouds

587.36 --> 591.839
the vapors from jets that's not

595.04 --> 598.959
proper english right if vapor form from

597.92 --> 602.24
jets

598.959 --> 605.8389999999999
dissipates it dissolves in the air

602.24 --> 605.839
because moist can do that

606.16 --> 612.8
if it doesn't do that it's not moist

610.079 --> 612.8
it's dust

617.12 --> 621.079
yeah as well soaring

640.32 --> 645.6
i i still remember in 95

643.279 --> 648.56
when i was 15

645.6 --> 650.48
when i first i like i wasn't even like

648.56 --> 652.56
on the internet or anything but i first

650.48 --> 654.5600000000001
noticed like whoa

652.56 --> 656.7199999999999
super clear day there's a plane flying

654.56 --> 658.8
over it's leaving this trail and then

656.72 --> 661.44
like in the evening

658.8 --> 663.519
still seeing the same trail but like all

661.44 --> 664.72
widened up and then i was like what is

663.519 --> 668.079
that

664.72 --> 670.9590000000001
i've never seen anything like that

668.079 --> 673.04
and my parents really didn't know

670.959 --> 675.1199999999999
like what it was either at the time but

673.04 --> 678.68
i still remember like having seen that

675.12 --> 678.68
for the first time

695.04 --> 700.8389999999999
hello by the way slow mo moon buggy

697.519 --> 700.839
jim smith

716.079 --> 721.12
what

718.24 --> 722.399
in the 70s

721.12 --> 725.639
i don't know what you're talking about

722.399 --> 725.639
old house

756.0 --> 763.92
no no yeah i will sorry no they don't

760.72 --> 766.5600000000001
no that's not true contrails don't stay

763.92 --> 768.16
in place for hours they absolutely do

766.56 --> 769.5189999999999
not i don't know where you're getting

768.16 --> 773.16
that from

769.519 --> 773.16
straight out incorrect

773.68 --> 777.4399999999999
it dissolves

775.76 --> 779.519
right

777.44 --> 782.1600000000001
it's

779.519 --> 784.88
water vapor because of the heat in the

782.16 --> 787.68
engine and all that it comes out

784.88 --> 789.68
then it immediately condensates

787.68 --> 792.4799999999999
into droplets

789.68 --> 794.079
like just like clouds

792.48 --> 795.9200000000001
but then

794.079 --> 797.3599999999999
probably because of the altitude and

795.92 --> 801.76
everything they

797.36 --> 803.6
immediately just dissolve into the air

801.76 --> 806.0
that probably has plenty of room for it

803.6 --> 808.5600000000001
to dissolve into

806.0 --> 810.32
at that height

808.56 --> 812.88
but it doesn't linger

810.32 --> 816.36
contrails don't linger that's how you

812.88 --> 816.36
know it's a contrail

831.279 --> 837.36
okay yeah that's odd old house radborn

836.24 --> 841.12
well

837.36 --> 845.6800000000001
he's probably then been witness

841.12 --> 845.68
to tests right because

845.76 --> 850.0
what i'm specifically talking about is

847.68 --> 851.279
just the geoengineering project which is

850.0 --> 852.16
worldwide

851.279 --> 854.32
but

852.16 --> 857.6
there have been like

854.32 --> 860.639
crowd manipulation tests as well

857.6 --> 863.279
with chemicals and radio frequencies

860.639 --> 865.44
guided by part yeah

863.279 --> 867.4399999999999
electrically enhancing particles there's

865.44 --> 869.0400000000001
been all kinds of weird tests right and

867.44 --> 872.9590000000001
there was like the whole more gallons

869.04 --> 874.48
breakout which is very highly suspected

872.959 --> 877.4799999999999
of

874.48 --> 877.48
pre-preceding

879.36 --> 883.76
following up

880.8 --> 885.8389999999999
spraying activities as well but those

883.76 --> 889.279
are not like

885.839 --> 891.6
uniform worldwide activities

889.279 --> 893.4399999999999
those are like separate tests they do

891.6 --> 897.16
also and they probably started doing

893.44 --> 897.1600000000001
that way back

898.639 --> 904.32
probably like since the

900.72 --> 904.32
well since world war ii

909.199 --> 915.8389999999999
if humidity is high contrast will no

913.04 --> 915.8389999999999
no they don't

919.44 --> 922.48
no

920.32 --> 924.0790000000001
that's just not true contrails don't

922.48 --> 926.16
linger for hours

924.079 --> 931.56
they grow thinner and thinner and then

926.16 --> 931.56
they dissipate they never linger

971.6 --> 974.0
whoa

972.56 --> 977.1199999999999
trippy

974.0 --> 977.12
slo-mo moon buggy

978.16 --> 982.4399999999999
that could have been a dream though

984.079 --> 990.2399999999999
like a dark world dream or something

986.32 --> 990.24
that well can be shared

991.279 --> 994.48
and if you share a dream

994.639 --> 999.759
then to you it's like real and then you

997.519 --> 1002.0
ask the person that you saw doing that

999.759 --> 1005.12
in your dream and they were aware of

1002.0 --> 1007.519
that as well in their inter interfacing

1005.12 --> 1009.519
of the dream and they'll say yeah

1007.519 --> 1011.92
yeah i did that

1009.519 --> 1014.16
and then who know like how do you then

1011.92 --> 1017.36
after that point even know it was like a

1014.16 --> 1019.279
dark world dream that you shared

1017.36 --> 1022.8000000000001
because normally in dreams you're the

1019.279 --> 1025.6
only one that that has memory of it

1022.8 --> 1029.799
but yeah i bet that prince has been like

1025.6 --> 1029.799
doing all kinds of weird stuff

1047.679 --> 1053.64
i was in the studio and she

1050.64 --> 1053.64
okay

1057.12 --> 1061.039
i'm not saying that didn't happen

1059.28 --> 1063.6789999999999
although it is kind of weird i don't

1061.039 --> 1065.12
know how to justify that i've never seen

1063.679 --> 1070.0
anybody

1065.12 --> 1072.0
in certain 3d reality doing that

1070.0 --> 1074.559
but i've seen plenty of weird things

1072.0 --> 1076.559
happen in the dark world and then having

1074.559 --> 1080.6789999999999
shared memories of it and then being

1076.559 --> 1080.6789999999999
really creeped out by that

1091.679 --> 1100.8400000000001
and disguise spray our applesauce what

1096.72 --> 1100.84
spraying apples and oranges

1108.4 --> 1112.88
now i'm just seeing a ply fling a plane

1111.36 --> 1114.3999999999999
fly by

1112.88 --> 1116.96
and then suddenly like apples and

1114.4 --> 1120.0800000000002
oranges falling out of the sky

1116.96 --> 1120.08
that's a weird idea

1121.6 --> 1125.0
hello snowbirds

1147.919 --> 1152.5590000000002
okay yeah plunder 23 is one way of

1150.08 --> 1152.559
saying it

1154.32 --> 1158.1599999999999
although i

1155.679 --> 1160.64
kind of like disagree with the the

1158.16 --> 1164.88
details of the context of that

1160.64 --> 1167.8400000000001
so i think it is actually the mind

1164.88 --> 1169.7600000000002
the mind that is using your

1167.84 --> 1173.36
normal

1169.76 --> 1176.559
nerve sensory routes for your input

1173.36 --> 1178.9599999999998
and how to process that input

1176.559 --> 1181.039
to basically create

1178.96 --> 1183.679
potential holographic experience

1181.039 --> 1185.44
environments for you

1183.679 --> 1187.919
for your conscious

1185.44 --> 1190.64
it's not not the body doing it it's your

1187.919 --> 1193.8400000000001
mind using the body

1190.64 --> 1193.8400000000001
in a different way

1206.08 --> 1208.3999999999999
right

1209.76 --> 1213.76
like when there's sensories involved

1211.76 --> 1215.36
other than just

1213.76 --> 1218.32
emotions and

1215.36 --> 1222.7199999999998
feelings i don't see that as the input

1218.32 --> 1225.12
of the body that's the mind

1222.72 --> 1227.3600000000001
there's a subconscious basically taking

1225.12 --> 1229.9189999999999
on

1227.36 --> 1232.4799999999998
mental construction processes and then

1229.919 --> 1234.48
your consciousness interfaces on another

1232.48 --> 1236.08
level instead of being directly in the

1234.48 --> 1239.2
control seat

1236.08 --> 1242.72
consciously controlling

1239.2 --> 1245.039
the subconscious takes over the process

1242.72 --> 1246.799
uses your sensory

1245.039 --> 1249.76
nerve routes

1246.799 --> 1251.6
to create the dream for your conscious

1249.76 --> 1254.08
experience which is not in direct

1251.6 --> 1254.08
control

1257.2 --> 1262.0800000000002
although you yeah you could

1259.84 --> 1264.48
realize that in the dream and then take

1262.08 --> 1268.559
control and all that often distorts the

1264.48 --> 1268.559
dreaming process and then you wake up

1268.72 --> 1273.88
anyway it's just minor details

1276.08 --> 1282.72
body is the oldest part what

1279.52 --> 1282.72
this is getting a bit weird

1284.08 --> 1288.3999999999999
it's a really weird thing to say plunder

1286.0 --> 1291.2
23 but

1288.4 --> 1294.159
that's all it's all good uh

1291.2 --> 1297.64
hello jess jeff gassett

1294.159 --> 1297.64
george sanford

1316.799 --> 1320.799
yeah george center i have no idea where

1319.039 --> 1321.84
where you're getting this information

1320.799 --> 1324.0
from

1321.84 --> 1325.84
contrails hanging around for four to six

1324.0 --> 1329.64
hours no

1325.84 --> 1329.6399999999999
i've never seen that

1332.48 --> 1337.039
like they never just stay in place that

1335.12 --> 1339.36
way

1337.039 --> 1342.72
if they're contrails and if they like

1339.36 --> 1345.4399999999998
feather out they spread out like that

1342.72 --> 1348.159
then they're not contrails condensation

1345.44 --> 1348.159
doesn't do that

1353.52 --> 1355.9189999999999
jaron

1354.16 --> 1360.44
[Music]

1355.919 --> 1360.44
had a good show yesterday okay

1363.12 --> 1368.3999999999999
don't you mean gerund

1366.159 --> 1368.4
right

1368.64 --> 1371.8400000000001
yeah there were plenty of good shows

1370.0 --> 1372.84
yesterday

1371.84 --> 1374.48
flat earth

1372.84 --> 1376.559
debates

1374.48 --> 1379.039
was was good

1376.559 --> 1382.8799999999999
happy to be part of it and the premiere

1379.039 --> 1382.8799999999999
also later was good

1383.44 --> 1389.52
at least no more stupid

1386.4 --> 1391.76
rowdiness also from my side

1389.52 --> 1391.76
uh

1393.12 --> 1398.4799999999998
yeah i did miss mitchell's stream again

1396.24 --> 1400.72
but it was for a good reason because i

1398.48 --> 1403.6
would like my friend from naime who

1400.72 --> 1405.76
called me again a long telephone call

1403.6 --> 1409.039
and it was right when he had his show

1405.76 --> 1412.799
but apparently he did like a sea tour

1409.039 --> 1414.64
went on a surfboard with his camera and

1412.799 --> 1417.6399999999999
live streamed like on the middle of the

1414.64 --> 1417.64
ocean

1420.32 --> 1426.1589999999999
right i was privy though to be there

1423.12 --> 1427.6789999999999
during jim bob's live stream

1426.159 --> 1430.8400000000001
and that was great

1427.679 --> 1430.8400000000001
and hilarious

1445.12 --> 1452.1589999999999
that's about it i think oh oh by the way

1449.52 --> 1455.1589999999999
it is thursday the 18th of november

1452.159 --> 1455.159
2021.

1456.88 --> 1461.7600000000002
very late

1459.44 --> 1464.64
saying that

1461.76 --> 1464.64
but anyway

1468.4 --> 1472.88
i didn't see any note

1470.24 --> 1474.24
oh wait yeah i did see a notification

1472.88 --> 1476.64
from jiren

1474.24 --> 1479.36
and that's eight hours ago that's i was

1476.64 --> 1479.3600000000001
sleeping then

1481.84 --> 1489.32
the problem with our ancestors how many

1483.919 --> 1489.3200000000002
great grandparents does one person have

1500.799 --> 1503.799
do

1517.679 --> 1523.039
do i accept other tokens on my eve

1521.44 --> 1524.3200000000002
at the wallet

1523.039 --> 1527.76
uh

1524.32 --> 1530.3999999999999
i could i guess but i am really clunky

1527.76 --> 1533.2
with that [ __ ]

1530.4 --> 1536.0800000000002
like i can barely get my

1533.2 --> 1536.0800000000002
things in order

1536.48 --> 1542.6
i feel like a grandpa when it comes to

1538.64 --> 1542.6000000000001
the dealing with crypto

1546.4 --> 1550.88
but i guess i could

1548.32 --> 1554.84
set my wallet into accepting the other

1550.88 --> 1554.8400000000001
type of tokens as well

1556.64 --> 1560.88
but for me seriously it's like i i can't

1559.12 --> 1563.1999999999998
even keep track of all that anymore

1560.88 --> 1565.1200000000001
there's like too many things to me oh

1563.2 --> 1567.039
this token that token to me it like

1565.12 --> 1568.84
really feels like why

1567.039 --> 1572.08
i don't even understand how that's

1568.84 --> 1572.08
working like

1573.36 --> 1580.1589999999999
like i i don't get it i really don't

1576.08 --> 1582.32
understand the dynamics behind

1580.159 --> 1584.5590000000002
why people even buy that

1582.32 --> 1587.6
it to me it's it's just starting to feel

1584.559 --> 1590.1589999999999
like collector [ __ ]

1587.6 --> 1590.1589999999999
like ooh

1590.48 --> 1595.44
comparable to baseball pictures except

1593.039 --> 1596.48
there's like new ones coming out

1595.44 --> 1598.4
every

1596.48 --> 1600.24
every month

1598.4 --> 1602.64
oh the new series oh another new series

1600.24 --> 1603.84
oh another news i don't understand why

1602.64 --> 1606.4
this

1603.84 --> 1607.36
why i yeah i

1606.4 --> 1610.24
it's

1607.36 --> 1613.12
the whole crypto i know people know how

1610.24 --> 1615.76
to get about in it and like karen talks

1613.12 --> 1617.6
about it like how do you do that how do

1615.76 --> 1620.24
you make a profit from it when you buy

1617.6 --> 1625.1999999999998
when you sell basics but i don't

1620.24 --> 1626.48
understand why it works i really don't

1625.2 --> 1628.72
i really

1626.48 --> 1631.6
really don't understand

1628.72 --> 1634.08
like on a visceral level

1631.6 --> 1636.48
it all seems like games to me

1634.08 --> 1639.279
it i i get the feeling like we're all

1636.48 --> 1642.08
being fooled into playing that game and

1639.279 --> 1644.559
thinking that it works when it's made to

1642.08 --> 1648.1589999999999
work artificially but that's

1644.559 --> 1650.399
probably because i just don't understand

1648.159 --> 1650.3990000000001
uh

1652.559 --> 1656.32
i

1653.52 --> 1658.559
yeah i guess that maybe at some point i

1656.32 --> 1660.72
will know how to work with it

1658.559 --> 1662.32
and if i get

1660.72 --> 1664.159
money out of it

1662.32 --> 1666.24
then i'll feel very differently about it

1664.159 --> 1668.0800000000002
i'll be like yeah yeah yeah yeah it's a

1666.24 --> 1670.159
game it doesn't make sense but you can

1668.08 --> 1674.1589999999999
make money out of it and as long as i

1670.159 --> 1674.159
can make money out of it i don't care

1674.24 --> 1677.88
because i wouldn't

1691.52 --> 1697.679
it works as a store of value yeah but it

1695.039 --> 1699.44
but it isn't actually it's literally

1697.679 --> 1701.52
nothing

1699.44 --> 1704.159
literally

1701.52 --> 1707.12
it's just information

1704.159 --> 1709.44
on a digital medium that's it there is

1707.12 --> 1711.76
no real product

1709.44 --> 1715.1200000000001
it doesn't do anything

1711.76 --> 1717.2
it's like oh we're trading in

1715.12 --> 1718.6399999999999
packaging paper

1717.2 --> 1720.48
right and then you think like oh well

1718.64 --> 1722.7990000000002
it's really good packaging paper then

1720.48 --> 1724.64
you could package something like an

1722.799 --> 1726.72
actual thing and

1724.64 --> 1728.3200000000002
yeah with all kinds of advantages and

1726.72 --> 1730.64
then you yeah this is the ultimate

1728.32 --> 1731.84
packaging paper but yeah without

1730.64 --> 1734.72
anything to

1731.84 --> 1738.279
wrap it around it's nothing it's just a

1734.72 --> 1738.279
bunch of paper

1740.08 --> 1743.76
that's kind of what it feels like to be

1746.399 --> 1750.08
yeah or like buying a house in the sims

1748.399 --> 1752.399
world right

1750.08 --> 1756.799
it's just digital data

1752.399 --> 1759.12
it doesn't have inherent value you can't

1756.799 --> 1761.6
like if everything breaks down you can't

1759.12 --> 1764.7199999999998
trade anything with it

1761.6 --> 1766.32
right with things like silver coins for

1764.72 --> 1768.48
example

1766.32 --> 1768.48
or

1769.12 --> 1774.1589999999999
yeah as a starting example yeah if

1771.12 --> 1778.52
everything breaks down you can actually

1774.159 --> 1778.5200000000002
get people to trade with it

1780.399 --> 1786.7199999999998
the cryptocurrency without a functioning

1783.12 --> 1789.76
society is completely and utterly

1786.72 --> 1793.1200000000001
useless in my opinion but that might be

1789.76 --> 1793.12
because i just don't get it

1793.36 --> 1796.8799999999999
i'm just responding to my

1797.44 --> 1802.52
intuition

1798.88 --> 1802.5200000000002
concerning that

1808.08 --> 1812.0
all right oh digital art version version

1810.24 --> 1813.919
of bitcoin

1812.0 --> 1816.64
right so that's just

1813.919 --> 1819.8400000000001
busying therapy then

1816.64 --> 1823.8400000000001
it's like using a video game

1819.84 --> 1823.84
as a trading cryptocurrency

1824.799 --> 1827.12
right

1828.88 --> 1834.0800000000002
i mean why not

1830.799 --> 1836.08
why not just have a video game let's say

1834.08 --> 1839.039
an older popular video game and you

1836.08 --> 1842.48
literally make a crypto currency

1839.039 --> 1844.559
that has the entire game program

1842.48 --> 1847.679
within

1844.559 --> 1849.76
its crypto system it's just in there

1847.679 --> 1851.039
structurally like no matter what happens

1849.76 --> 1852.8799999999999
no matter

1851.039 --> 1854.08
like every time you could just take the

1852.88 --> 1857.279
token

1854.08 --> 1858.6399999999999
and then find the entire game program in

1857.279 --> 1861.36
there

1858.64 --> 1862.64
and then run it on any kind of computer

1861.36 --> 1865.6399999999999
right

1862.64 --> 1865.64
but

1866.0 --> 1871.919
yeah i might have just created a really

1868.24 --> 1874.0
weird new crypto revolution

1871.919 --> 1876.48
with that idea

1874.0 --> 1878.279
like why not if you're gonna

1876.48 --> 1881.3600000000001
use

1878.279 --> 1885.039
cryptocurrency as an art medium

1881.36 --> 1885.039
then why not as a computer game

1887.279 --> 1892.32
you know it's just information

1890.0 --> 1894.72
it's not like oh there's such a shortage

1892.32 --> 1897.2
of room in the information no there's an

1894.72 --> 1898.48
abundance of room it's only getting more

1897.2 --> 1901.6000000000001
so yeah the

1898.48 --> 1903.2
you could store all kinds of complex

1901.6 --> 1906.32
sets of data

1903.2 --> 1908.24
in it eventually it starts small but it

1906.32 --> 1911.36
could be pretty big

1908.24 --> 1911.36
dude eventually

1912.32 --> 1915.84
you could even use cryptocurrency to

1914.799 --> 1920.36
just

1915.84 --> 1920.36
transfer secret information

1922.0 --> 1925.919
like you could just use it a crypto coin

1924.159 --> 1928.0
and then at some point if you have the

1925.919 --> 1930.0800000000002
right key to tap into that information

1928.0 --> 1932.64
you take the crypto coin you use the key

1930.08 --> 1934.6399999999999
and then you get a report of all kinds

1932.64 --> 1937.039
of things

1934.64 --> 1940.48
that you can only see in that crypto if

1937.039 --> 1940.48
you have that key

1940.64 --> 1944.72
dude

1942.0 --> 1944.72
it's crazy

1947.44 --> 1952.3200000000002
nft games are picking up oh right so it

1950.48 --> 1954.799
it's already there

1952.32 --> 1954.799
sheesh

1956.0 --> 1962.08
but i don't really get the point though

1959.6 --> 1964.24
like in the trend in the growth process

1962.08 --> 1966.48
yes

1964.24 --> 1966.48
but

1966.559 --> 1973.6789999999999
outside of that outside of the trend

1971.279 --> 1976.679
i don't see it i don't see the actual

1973.679 --> 1976.679
value

1991.919 --> 1996.88
when they visit space only if you have

1994.24 --> 1996.88
minecraft

1997.76 --> 2001.679
right

1999.44 --> 2004.0
but look it's all very trendy but like

2001.679 --> 2006.0
you're right blunder23 the younger

2004.0 --> 2008.72
generations will now be exposed to like

2006.0 --> 2011.039
this digital stuff

2008.72 --> 2014.24
they're not really gonna learn the value

2011.039 --> 2017.2
of actual physical things like this

2014.24 --> 2019.6
right it's just computer game tokens and

2017.2 --> 2021.1200000000001
like virtual loot and like oh let's get

2019.6 --> 2022.8799999999999
the virtual loot and yeah it's very

2021.12 --> 2025.76
engaging and very

2022.88 --> 2028.159
stimulating for the mind at first

2025.76 --> 2032.919
but what are you really gonna do with it

2028.159 --> 2032.919
other than entertaining yourself

2047.76 --> 2052.399
how do we get to this subject this is

2050.079 --> 2052.3990000000003
weird

2054.56 --> 2060.919
oh yeah yeah somebody asked me if i

2056.639 --> 2060.9190000000003
would accept other types of crypto

2062.0 --> 2067.76
right but yeah if if you want to do

2064.159 --> 2069.599
something with that contact me on skype

2067.76 --> 2071.28
address is in the description box

2069.599 --> 2073.28
contact me there and then we can like

2071.28 --> 2075.52
chat about it

2073.28 --> 2076.7200000000003
and you could like potentially help me

2075.52 --> 2081.44
out to

2076.72 --> 2081.4399999999996
arrange my wallet to be able to take it

2082.879 --> 2089.52
because i am like a grandpa with that

2085.76 --> 2092.3990000000003
it's like oh

2089.52 --> 2096.32
why isn't it working

2092.399 --> 2096.3199999999997
i'm putting my mouse on the screen

2098.079 --> 2101.88
that's me with crypto

2105.44 --> 2111.04
all right you have to be probably over

2107.76 --> 2111.0400000000004
30 to get that job

2113.2 --> 2118.72
because it's going to be hard to even

2115.359 --> 2120.72
find elder elderly now that don't know

2118.72 --> 2123.5989999999997
how to use a computer

2120.72 --> 2125.359
but like 30 years ago that was like a

2123.599 --> 2128.4
yeah that was like a

2125.359 --> 2128.4
cultural issue

2129.04 --> 2132.56
that there were a lot of elderly that

2130.72 --> 2134.9599999999996
had a lot of trouble trying to

2132.56 --> 2135.68
understand how to work a computer

2134.96 --> 2138.079
and

2135.68 --> 2142.2799999999997
it was kind of funny back then

2138.079 --> 2142.28
now that's much more rare

2150.24 --> 2153.24
do

2165.28 --> 2170.32
okay blunder23 whatever man look i'm

2168.4 --> 2171.839
literally not even following what you're

2170.32 --> 2175.44
saying at this point

2171.839 --> 2175.44
like i can't follow you

2175.92 --> 2178.7200000000003
i don't get it

2178.8 --> 2183.119
but yeah people are oh it's so promising

2181.119 --> 2186.1600000000003
and oh yeah people are making money and

2183.119 --> 2188.0
then it's like yeah okay well i'm not

2186.16 --> 2190.0789999999997
telling you you gotta stop you know

2188.0 --> 2192.0
especially if you're getting really good

2190.079 --> 2195.0
at it and you are making a profit from

2192.0 --> 2195.0
it

2205.119 --> 2211.92
printing of money has gone up 350 money

2208.56 --> 2214.0
has no value yeah but that's true

2211.92 --> 2216.32
it's only gonna get worse seeking star

2214.0 --> 2217.359
water hello by the way

2216.32 --> 2218.6400000000003
but

2217.359 --> 2222.16
yeah

2218.64 --> 2225.359
how about freaking crypto

2222.16 --> 2229.04
dude there just look at how much is out

2225.359 --> 2230.72
there now and it's getting more and more

2229.04 --> 2231.68
everything's getting flooded with that

2230.72 --> 2234.3999999999996
[ __ ]

2231.68 --> 2238.3199999999997
so how long is it gonna take

2234.4 --> 2241.599
before there's gonna be more crypto like

2238.32 --> 2243.92
billions of different cryptos out there

2241.599 --> 2246.4
completely flooding the [ __ ] out of the

2243.92 --> 2246.4
market

2246.56 --> 2250.64
how long is it gonna take before it's

2248.24 --> 2253.7599999999998
gonna outdo the printing presses of the

2250.64 --> 2253.7599999999998
actual paper money

2276.8 --> 2280.8
what's the lockdown switch i have i have

2278.96 --> 2283.44
no idea

2280.8 --> 2285.2000000000003
i have not seen any lockdown situation

2283.44 --> 2286.56
here

2285.2 --> 2290.56
i mean they're

2286.56 --> 2290.56
they're whining and complaining about

2290.64 --> 2294.3199999999997
locking down the unvaccinated and all

2292.8 --> 2297.8390000000004
that

2294.32 --> 2299.92
i'm just it's not gonna

2297.839 --> 2302.7999999999997
and if that means i'm gonna get into

2299.92 --> 2305.6800000000003
fights with police then so be it i'm not

2302.8 --> 2307.3590000000004
gonna be locked down especially when it

2305.68 --> 2308.8799999999997
comes to just getting food in the

2307.359 --> 2312.0789999999997
daytime

2308.88 --> 2314.4
it's not gonna happen

2312.079 --> 2317.76
and if that means i'm gonna be the spark

2314.4 --> 2323.1600000000003
that ignites this can of gasoline

2317.76 --> 2323.1600000000003
then so be it i am not gonna be stopped

2329.2 --> 2334.1189999999997
lock down for climate change yeah that's

2331.119 --> 2334.119
horrific

2344.4 --> 2348.4
how much of a net worth you think

2346.72 --> 2351.1189999999997
someone needs to be

2348.4 --> 2353.28
worth in order to retire their career

2351.119 --> 2355.28
fairly comfortable

2353.28 --> 2358.8
i don't know i have no idea i'm not a

2355.28 --> 2361.8390000000004
specialist in any of that like dude i am

2358.8 --> 2364.6400000000003
like financially handicapped i don't

2361.839 --> 2367.52
know if you guys noticed but i literally

2364.64 --> 2370.16
need donations just to be able to eat

2367.52 --> 2372.88
right and that's a guy in his 40s

2370.16 --> 2375.2
compared to the average i am financially

2372.88 --> 2379.599
handicapped

2375.2 --> 2379.5989999999997
i am not the one to ask these questions

2379.68 --> 2387.04
i i am not really capable of giving

2384.56 --> 2389.92
solid financial advice pretty much

2387.04 --> 2393.7599999999998
everything else yeah not financial

2389.92 --> 2395.44
advice but from a preliminary to the

2393.76 --> 2397.44
distance ooh

2395.44 --> 2399.359
feeling the wind

2397.44 --> 2400.32
yeah i think there's going to arrive a

2399.359 --> 2404.56
point

2400.32 --> 2407.44
where nobody can ever retire

2404.56 --> 2408.56
to have a fairly comfortable life ever

2407.44 --> 2409.28
because

2408.56 --> 2411.2
the

2409.28 --> 2412.88
is going to go with everything or

2411.2 --> 2416.3999999999996
inflation whatever it's going to be

2412.88 --> 2418.4
called in free fall so that literally

2416.4 --> 2419.359
you can never stop

2418.4 --> 2421.04
doing

2419.359 --> 2423.5989999999997
what you need to do

2421.04 --> 2425.359
or literally the value of everything

2423.599 --> 2427.2000000000003
you've collected the preponderance of

2425.359 --> 2429.7599999999998
the value of everything collected will

2427.2 --> 2432.3999999999996
go into free fall and it'll be worth

2429.76 --> 2435.2000000000003
zero in like a year

2432.4 --> 2437.359
zero it will compete completely useless

2435.2 --> 2439.359
and outdated so that the rest of your

2437.359 --> 2441.92
life until your death you're going to

2439.359 --> 2444.7999999999997
have to be busy to keep at it in the

2441.92 --> 2447.04
game just to be able to keep afloat

2444.8 --> 2450.0
yeah that's the situation that i see

2447.04 --> 2452.8
coming not looking forward to it

2450.0 --> 2454.72
right the idea of retirement oh now i've

2452.8 --> 2457.6800000000003
done enough work and i can just go on

2454.72 --> 2458.9599999999996
for 20 years yeah say goodbye to those

2457.68 --> 2461.68
days

2458.96 --> 2463.28
it's everything's gonna be in freefall

2461.68 --> 2466.56
forever

2463.28 --> 2470.96
you can never stop playing the games the

2466.56 --> 2473.359
trade games whatever it is the trends

2470.96 --> 2476.079
and think you can maintain some kind of

2473.359 --> 2478.96
comfortable value for the long term

2476.079 --> 2480.5600000000004
that's gonna be goodbye to that

2478.96 --> 2483.119
that's my prediction

2480.56 --> 2486.0
but then again i am not a financial

2483.119 --> 2489.839
specialist i had a long shot but that's

2486.0 --> 2489.839
my intuition saying that

2490.16 --> 2496.0789999999997
it's already moving there slowly

2493.599 --> 2499.28
but the crypto revolution is only going

2496.079 --> 2502.76
to aggravate that effect i know it will

2499.28 --> 2502.76
i know it

2515.52 --> 2520.72
right so just like the

2518.079 --> 2523.6800000000003
federal reserve for example has to keep

2520.72 --> 2525.2
on printing more money just to not

2523.68 --> 2530.8799999999997
collapse

2525.2 --> 2533.4399999999996
so will every individual in the world

2530.88 --> 2535.52
have to effectively keep doing something

2533.44 --> 2537.76
very similar

2535.52 --> 2540.4
or they'll lose everything

2537.76 --> 2542.88
yeah you're all going to be private

2540.4 --> 2545.04
banks now that's what you wanted wasn't

2542.88 --> 2547.76
it oh we could be separate with the

2545.04 --> 2550.16
crypto oh we're so independent they have

2547.76 --> 2552.7200000000003
no control congratulations

2550.16 --> 2555.68
you now have the fate

2552.72 --> 2559.72
of a central bank good luck

2555.68 --> 2559.72
because you're gonna need it

2567.28 --> 2573.119
that's maybe a bit exaggerated but i i

2570.0 --> 2573.119
hope you get the point

2573.599 --> 2576.599
huh

2579.599 --> 2583.119
hello america silver patriot

2591.119 --> 2595.52
god's the one year the economy has gone

2593.92 --> 2597.28
no that's not what i said at all don't

2595.52 --> 2599.2
take me out of context

2597.28 --> 2601.8390000000004
first off i don't make financial

2599.2 --> 2603.7599999999998
predictions

2601.839 --> 2605.68
like practical financial predictions i'm

2603.76 --> 2607.92
not going to tell you how to do it

2605.68 --> 2610.0789999999997
because i can barely keep track of it

2607.92 --> 2611.04
all and it's not going to go and get any

2610.079 --> 2612.88
better

2611.04 --> 2617.119
but what i can do

2612.88 --> 2618.6400000000003
is apply my arwenian insights

2617.119 --> 2623.28
my oracling

2618.64 --> 2626.56
to get a feel of the direction to see

2623.28 --> 2628.1600000000003
the fractal long-term patterns to feel

2626.56 --> 2631.2799999999997
it out

2628.16 --> 2633.5989999999997
and not get preoccupied by the temporal

2631.28 --> 2634.8
details of the time that you could use

2633.599 --> 2637.04
to

2634.8 --> 2639.52
to make profit from and all that i

2637.04 --> 2640.8
ignore that part and i just look at the

2639.52 --> 2642.72
big thing

2640.8 --> 2644.7200000000003
that's something that i can do that's

2642.72 --> 2647.7599999999998
something that i will not

2644.72 --> 2650.24
lose the ability to do

2647.76 --> 2653.28
even though i am

2650.24 --> 2657.16
like financially handicapped

2653.28 --> 2657.1600000000003
i can still do that

2664.319 --> 2668.56
no what i said one year

2666.48 --> 2671.68
new economy no that's not what i said i

2668.56 --> 2671.68
was saying that

2672.079 --> 2675.599
everybody's just gonna get their own

2673.839 --> 2678.48
crypto

2675.599 --> 2680.96
then yeah it is already kind of a bit of

2678.48 --> 2683.04
you have to constantly put work in it to

2680.96 --> 2684.4
get a profit out of it if you just

2683.04 --> 2685.839
decide okay

2684.4 --> 2688.319
i'm gonna

2685.839 --> 2690.56
leave everything as it is with all the

2688.319 --> 2692.0
crypto things for like a month we'll see

2690.56 --> 2694.24
what happens

2692.0 --> 2695.04
see what happens

2694.24 --> 2697.04
right

2695.04 --> 2698.4
okay some things you might have invested

2697.04 --> 2700.88
into like certain things and then you

2698.4 --> 2704.48
get lucky it gets a boost and then you

2700.88 --> 2706.8
get profit but yeah if you just

2704.48 --> 2709.44
let's just say wait a year

2706.8 --> 2711.44
there's a very great likelihood that

2709.44 --> 2713.359
everything has become completely useless

2711.44 --> 2715.44
or has even been

2713.359 --> 2717.92
become untradable

2715.44 --> 2720.319
like it's outdated there's another

2717.92 --> 2721.76
crypto that has taken his place that is

2720.319 --> 2724.0
now all the rage

2721.76 --> 2724.0
right

2724.64 --> 2730.24
that's what i was saying i didn't talk

2727.119 --> 2731.2000000000003
about the entire economy in the world i

2730.24 --> 2732.72
have

2731.2 --> 2736.56
no

2732.72 --> 2736.56
interest to predict such things

2745.44 --> 2749.68
the u.s is off

2747.92 --> 2752.6800000000003
the federators what are you talking

2749.68 --> 2752.68
about

2766.0 --> 2769.0
so

2777.44 --> 2780.079
what are you talking about old house red

2779.2 --> 2782.319
bone

2780.079 --> 2782.319
like

2782.96 --> 2786.079
where are you getting that from

2786.4 --> 2790.56
federal reserve is not

2788.56 --> 2792.48
stopping what it's doing

2790.56 --> 2794.72
it's not been neutered it's not been

2792.48 --> 2796.079
changed it's doing exactly the same

2794.72 --> 2797.7599999999998
freaking thing so i don't know where

2796.079 --> 2799.44
you're getting that from

2797.76 --> 2802.1600000000003
i mean if there was really something

2799.44 --> 2804.079
there like a dramatic change of the role

2802.16 --> 2807.1189999999997
of the federal reserve it will be all

2804.079 --> 2807.119
over the freaking news

2807.44 --> 2812.119
so

2808.319 --> 2812.119
i'm not seeing it

2826.96 --> 2832.64
to quote eddie bravo oh yeah sure

2834.4 --> 2839.76
right so it's it's that thing again yeah

2837.76 --> 2842.2400000000002
i've already addressed that oh the

2839.76 --> 2844.48
crypto revolution we're gonna be

2842.24 --> 2846.839
we're gonna overtake the federal reserve

2844.48 --> 2849.2
we're gonna take their power away

2846.839 --> 2850.24
congratulations now you are a central

2849.2 --> 2853.2
bank

2850.24 --> 2856.16
you're gonna have the same problems

2853.2 --> 2858.48
that that was the point i made earlier

2856.16 --> 2861.04
would it be all over the news yeah yeah

2858.48 --> 2863.76
it would if suddenly the entire role of

2861.04 --> 2867.96
the federal reserve changed yeah it will

2863.76 --> 2867.96
be over world news

2880.4 --> 2886.48
yeah you can't just quietly phase out

2883.2 --> 2889.52
the federal reserve okay

2886.48 --> 2889.52
yeah it would

2890.16 --> 2895.359
yeah old horse rod one it would

2893.2 --> 2898.5589999999997
you don't have to ask again i know it

2895.359 --> 2901.5989999999997
would you should too

2898.559 --> 2903.119
in the tv what are you talking about tv

2901.599 --> 2905.76
i'm talking about

2903.119 --> 2906.88
every news outlet that would be the

2905.76 --> 2909.2000000000003
story

2906.88 --> 2911.599
of the world

2909.2 --> 2913.04
because it's been a problem for a long

2911.599 --> 2915.839
time

2913.04 --> 2917.92
the half the conspiracy thinking world

2915.839 --> 2920.16
is rife

2917.92 --> 2922.319
with ideas about the federal reserve and

2920.16 --> 2924.7999999999997
how it's a problem if suddenly their

2922.319 --> 2927.52
role dramatically changed they would be

2924.8 --> 2929.28
like cut off or something

2927.52 --> 2932.16
it would be

2929.28 --> 2934.2400000000002
over the news dude

2932.16 --> 2936.96
if you think they could keep something

2934.24 --> 2938.7999999999997
like that quiet you're crazy

2936.96 --> 2941.359
it's no way i'm not saying it's going to

2938.8 --> 2942.96
be on cnn like cnn or something might

2941.359 --> 2946.16
skip out at it

2942.96 --> 2947.52
everything else though like every other

2946.16 --> 2950.64
internet

2947.52 --> 2954.16
news organization and alternative news

2950.64 --> 2956.0
groups and journalists yeah it would be

2954.16 --> 2958.96
everywhere

2956.0 --> 2958.96
very quickly

2960.4 --> 2963.52
there's no way

2961.76 --> 2965.0400000000004
that an event like that could be kept

2963.52 --> 2966.079
secret no

2965.04 --> 2967.52
way

2966.079 --> 2970.4
ever

2967.52 --> 2972.88
unless like the entire world was like

2970.4 --> 2976.2400000000002
under direct

2972.88 --> 2979.119
threat of war right

2976.24 --> 2981.4399999999996
really serious threat

2979.119 --> 2983.44
if like we got a bigger problem then

2981.44 --> 2985.92
they might that might slip past because

2983.44 --> 2988.0
it wouldn't matter anymore

2985.92 --> 2990.64
but right now yeah

2988.0 --> 2992.079
yeah there's no way in the world

2990.64 --> 2995.0789999999997
something like that could be kept a

2992.079 --> 2995.079
secret

3036.4 --> 3039.7200000000003
right so

3041.76 --> 3045.079
i don't know

3058.16 --> 3063.96
i timed them out it was getting on my

3060.079 --> 3063.96
nerves it's just annoying

3081.2 --> 3085.7599999999998
how long

3082.559 --> 3087.92
for the universal basic income

3085.76 --> 3087.92
well

3090.0 --> 3094.64
i guess that depends on the region

3092.88 --> 3097.28
but i don't it's not going to be very

3094.64 --> 3099.2799999999997
successful though

3097.28 --> 3101.599
right i think it's like already sort of

3099.28 --> 3103.2000000000003
been tested effectively they might have

3101.599 --> 3104.319
not called it that

3103.2 --> 3106.3999999999996
but

3104.319 --> 3109.359
in america i've heard that they've

3106.4 --> 3111.76
already just started to pay out

3109.359 --> 3115.359
like that

3111.76 --> 3115.3590000000004
although it's more like a bribe

3116.24 --> 3120.839
but

3117.2 --> 3120.839
it's not gonna work

3131.599 --> 3137.8
we have it in america right

3134.24 --> 3137.7999999999997
so i've heard

3140.48 --> 3145.44
what jobs would be left

3142.559 --> 3148.48
for humans in the future uh the jobs

3145.44 --> 3148.48
that we make

3149.2 --> 3154.3999999999996
you're gonna have to make your own jobs

3151.599 --> 3156.88
there won't be any left because the mega

3154.4 --> 3159.76
industry industrialists

3156.88 --> 3160.88
are moving towar towards a world without

3159.76 --> 3163.5200000000004
humans

3160.88 --> 3166.7200000000003
where humans are only in existence to

3163.52 --> 3170.16
profit from to reap from as they are

3166.72 --> 3170.16
phased out into nothing

3174.079 --> 3179.7200000000003
gonna have to make your own jobs create

3176.319 --> 3179.72
your own market

3184.8 --> 3192.599
right providing services for example

3189.119 --> 3192.599
getting a trade

3198.319 --> 3201.2
growing food

3203.44 --> 3207.76
are self-driving automatic cars a

3205.44 --> 3210.7200000000003
possibility yeah they are

3207.76 --> 3215.6800000000003
and they're the worst

3210.72 --> 3215.68
i am absolutely repulsed by the idea

3217.04 --> 3221.2799999999997
absolutely repulsed

3219.92 --> 3223.6800000000003
because the

3221.28 --> 3226.4
the potential to abuse that sort of [ __ ]

3223.68 --> 3229.5989999999997
is horrendous and it's gonna breed

3226.4 --> 3230.7200000000003
people that are horrendous

3229.599 --> 3233.52
the more

3230.72 --> 3235.1189999999997
you relinquish control to some kind of

3233.52 --> 3237.52
digital system

3235.119 --> 3241.119
out of the hands of people the more

3237.52 --> 3245.7599999999998
horrific the people will become

3241.119 --> 3246.88
arrogant stupid short-sighted annoying

3245.76 --> 3249.0400000000004
bored

3246.88 --> 3250.48
and all the terrible things that come

3249.04 --> 3253.119
with it

3250.48 --> 3253.119
useless

3258.72 --> 3266.48
driving a car is

3262.079 --> 3269.52
or a bike even is a great thing

3266.48 --> 3271.28
it tests your skills it keeps you sharp

3269.52 --> 3273.359
there's actually a whole bunch of things

3271.28 --> 3275.2000000000003
you can learn and it's i find it very

3273.359 --> 3277.7599999999998
stimulating

3275.2 --> 3280.24
to take that all away

3277.76 --> 3281.5200000000004
and just make stupid computers do

3280.24 --> 3283.5989999999997
everything

3281.52 --> 3286.599
it's terrible

3283.599 --> 3286.599
terrible

3294.88 --> 3300.319
and it's gonna mock up

3296.88 --> 3302.7200000000003
mock up dudes you have no idea how bad

3300.319 --> 3304.72
it will eventually mock up because if

3302.72 --> 3306.9599999999996
everything's gonna become like that

3304.72 --> 3310.0789999999997
then eventually it's going to break down

3306.96 --> 3313.28
and the people will literally

3310.079 --> 3316.079
have lost their skills in the process to

3313.28 --> 3317.3590000000004
even fix it anymore

3316.079 --> 3321.52
and then you're going to have a

3317.359 --> 3325.359
completely useless broken down society

3321.52 --> 3325.359
with only numpties

3325.92 --> 3330.319
that's what's gonna happen that's what's

3327.359 --> 3330.319
gonna grow out of that

3331.119 --> 3335.839
that's the fruit that it will bear

3342.72 --> 3350.8799999999997
how often do i get a chance to drive

3346.0 --> 3352.799
i don't know i go on my bike every day

3350.88 --> 3353.839
i like that

3352.799 --> 3356.4
uh

3353.839 --> 3359.2
driving a car has been a while but i'm

3356.4 --> 3359.2000000000003
very good at it

3359.52 --> 3364.64
like very good at it never had a single

3362.72 --> 3367.4399999999996
accident

3364.64 --> 3368.64
even in times when i probably

3367.44 --> 3370.7200000000003
should have

3368.64 --> 3373.7599999999998
you know that's a crazy thing to say but

3370.72 --> 3375.839
when like other people like go crazy

3373.76 --> 3378.3190000000004
i see it i can feel it

3375.839 --> 3380.72
i can feel it coming ahead of time

3378.319 --> 3382.5589999999997
and that way like even if somebody would

3380.72 --> 3383.9199999999996
like have a big crash

3382.559 --> 3385.8390000000004
in front of me

3383.92 --> 3388.319
i would never

3385.839 --> 3390.5589999999997
get caught in that ever

3388.319 --> 3393.52
because i feel it coming i've never had

3390.559 --> 3393.52
an accident ever

3394.64 --> 3397.2799999999997
like

3395.44 --> 3399.52
never been involved in somebody else

3397.28 --> 3403.96
making an accident that's what basically

3399.52 --> 3403.96
i mean i've never made one myself

3407.599 --> 3410.96
right i actually thought at some point

3409.92 --> 3413.599
like

3410.96 --> 3415.599
i was gonna do a career as a cab driver

3413.599 --> 3418.599
because i would be freaking brilliant at

3415.599 --> 3418.599
it

3419.44 --> 3423.119
and then i met my ex-girlfriend

3426.079 --> 3429.92
then that chance slipped

3430.72 --> 3433.839
because of my own choice

3461.28 --> 3467.599
yeah i'm not gonna

3463.2 --> 3467.5989999999997
answer those questions steven traveler

3469.119 --> 3475.2000000000003
i've not owned any

3471.52 --> 3478.559
cars i inherited one car from my mom

3475.2 --> 3478.5589999999997
that's it and had to

3478.72 --> 3481.68
yeah

3479.68 --> 3484.3999999999996
i have decommissioned

3481.68 --> 3486.96
which was a very painful process because

3484.4 --> 3489.839
i really like that car

3486.96 --> 3489.839
it was really good

3489.92 --> 3496.16
despite the maintenance costs which were

3492.319 --> 3496.16
not that insanely high

3500.799 --> 3505.04
but i'm not really a big car guy

3510.88 --> 3515.799
your car is your wife okay

3527.44 --> 3530.92
okay let's

3533.2 --> 3537.319
yeah let's not go there

3552.0 --> 3557.04
yeah lol nah don't do that here please

3554.96 --> 3559.839
don't get gross i really do not

3557.04 --> 3559.839
appreciate that

3561.599 --> 3566.2400000000002
hello by the way geoshifter

3564.64 --> 3568.48
did you

3566.24 --> 3572.0789999999997
see this space debris

3568.48 --> 3573.76
announcements for the iss again

3572.079 --> 3577.7200000000003
every time i hear that word i have to

3573.76 --> 3577.7200000000003
think of your music video

3597.52 --> 3602.839
when are my thoughts on mass transit

3599.839 --> 3602.839
what

3629.119 --> 3632.96
you mean public transportation

3636.72 --> 3643.64
steamy traveler is that what you mean

3639.04 --> 3643.64
like buses and trains and all that

3671.44 --> 3677.119
well my thoughts on it are yeah sure

3674.48 --> 3677.119
that's great

3677.2 --> 3681.7599999999998
as long as

3679.2 --> 3684.0789999999997
it's truly free

3681.76 --> 3686.6400000000003
as long as just a basic setup it's not

3684.079 --> 3688.559
going to be subjected by crazy mind

3686.64 --> 3691.04
control operations

3688.559 --> 3693.3590000000004
because that's happening now like

3691.04 --> 3695.92
all this time for years now

3693.359 --> 3697.119
you have to wear masks in the freaking

3695.92 --> 3699.6800000000003
bus

3697.119 --> 3700.559
like for no freaking reason like all the

3699.68 --> 3702.48
time

3700.559 --> 3705.76
even when it was no longer mandated they

3702.48 --> 3707.28
just the company decided to still uphold

3705.76 --> 3709.44
it

3707.28 --> 3711.44
i hate it i'm not going with the bus

3709.44 --> 3714.0
anymore because of that because they've

3711.44 --> 3716.559
been politicized

3714.0 --> 3721.039
you subject yourself to like mega

3716.559 --> 3723.2000000000003
corporation politics and policies now

3721.039 --> 3724.3190000000004
that sucks

3723.2 --> 3727.4399999999996
really

3724.319 --> 3729.7599999999998
really sucks

3727.44 --> 3732.0
because before all that [ __ ] happened

3729.76 --> 3734.96
public transport was great

3732.0 --> 3734.96
it's really handy

3735.2 --> 3738.72
now it just sucks

3739.68 --> 3742.96
i think that like all the people that

3741.839 --> 3744.88
are like

3742.96 --> 3747.92
at the head of that corporation because

3744.88 --> 3752.1600000000003
it is corporatized basically the public

3747.92 --> 3752.16
transport here they should all be fired

3753.68 --> 3758.8799999999997
without pension just get the [ __ ] out of

3756.319 --> 3762.44
here you filthy political agents get the

3758.88 --> 3762.44
[ __ ] out of here

3786.24 --> 3789.24
uh

3799.119 --> 3802.799
public transportation is for city cities

3801.28 --> 3805.28
suck

3802.799 --> 3805.28
i guess

3805.359 --> 3810.88
but it's still really handy though

3809.119 --> 3813.039
as long as it's not if as long as you're

3810.88 --> 3815.76
not being subjected to stupid mind

3813.039 --> 3816.96
control [ __ ] and you're in there as long

3815.76 --> 3819.44
as just

3816.96 --> 3822.7200000000003
as long as order

3819.44 --> 3825.839
and efficiency and common decency reigns

3822.72 --> 3825.839
within it

3826.24 --> 3831.4799999999996
but that's the universal problem isn't

3828.48 --> 3831.48
it

3854.16 --> 3861.0389999999998
the japanese wore masks before this wild

3857.76 --> 3861.039
hoax that's not

3864.839 --> 3869.7599999999998
english and yeah japanese

3868.079 --> 3872.96
i think on average have a lot of

3869.76 --> 3875.039
allergies so that might also be a reason

3872.96 --> 3878.68
because of pollen allergies

3875.039 --> 3878.6800000000003
that they wear masks

3894.319 --> 3897.2799999999997
hello dx

3907.359 --> 3913.2799999999997
instead of calling in six

3909.839 --> 3913.2799999999997
sick being more masks

3913.92 --> 3916.799
that's stupid

3918.24 --> 3922.4799999999996
if you're sick you need to stick it out

3920.559 --> 3923.52
you need to recover you need to let it

3922.48 --> 3926.48
go

3923.52 --> 3928.559
the stress levels in order to recover

3926.48 --> 3930.4
putting on a mask and going back to work

3928.559 --> 3933.559
doesn't help you it's just going to make

3930.4 --> 3933.559
it worse

3946.0 --> 3952.16
pollution not pollen

3948.48 --> 3953.599
heavy manufacturing in japan what

3952.16 --> 3955.2
i have no idea what you're talking about

3953.599 --> 3957.92
george sanford

3955.2 --> 3960.72
i was on the impression that japan was

3957.92 --> 3961.6800000000003
actually really

3960.72 --> 3962.839
clean

3961.68 --> 3964.5589999999997
on

3962.839 --> 3965.44
average

3964.559 --> 3968.88
not

3965.44 --> 3972.96
dirty in their industry

3968.88 --> 3974.7200000000003
because they don't have much room

3972.96 --> 3976.2400000000002
on that island

3974.72 --> 3977.68
and if you're gonna then pollute the

3976.24 --> 3979.52
[ __ ] out of everything it's going to be

3977.68 --> 3982.0789999999997
a great burden so i always thought that

3979.52 --> 3984.96
the japanese were very clean in their

3982.079 --> 3989.119
industry compared to other countries

3984.96 --> 3989.119
like unlike china for example

3990.24 --> 3996.4799999999996
like china is just

3992.4 --> 4000.079
dirty as [ __ ] and india also knows

3996.48 --> 4004.0
basically yeah they're also quite dirty

4000.079 --> 4004.0
but japan isn't as far as i've

4004.839 --> 4011.0
heard what causes chickenpox and i don't

4008.0 --> 4011.0
know

4043.76 --> 4050.559
now would gas fax it well yeah

4046.24 --> 4050.5589999999997
well i i don't have all the data but

4050.64 --> 4056.0
it's a lot of vaccine programs even

4053.039 --> 4057.5200000000004
reaching way back it turns out that

4056.0 --> 4059.839
the disease you're supposed to be

4057.52 --> 4062.48
vaccinated for actually then causes the

4059.839 --> 4066.319
disease in many cases i don't know if

4062.48 --> 4066.319
that's the same for chickenpox

4067.2 --> 4071.68
but yeah

4069.039 --> 4071.6800000000003
it could be

4072.559 --> 4076.119
i wouldn't be surprised

4083.52 --> 4089.28
then we're masculine densely populated

4086.559 --> 4092.4
infection can spread easy yeah yeah it

4089.28 --> 4095.599
can't actually logical conclusion

4092.4 --> 4097.759
because that's not how that works at all

4095.599 --> 4099.52
but yeah

4097.759 --> 4102.839
there is

4099.52 --> 4105.120000000001
germ phobia in japan

4102.839 --> 4108.159
japanese are

4105.12 --> 4109.5199999999995
have tendencies to phobia in all kinds

4108.159 --> 4111.92
of ways

4109.52 --> 4113.279
some of them are really allergic

4111.92 --> 4115.279
to pollen

4113.279 --> 4116.719
sometimes to uh

4115.279 --> 4119.52
milk

4116.719 --> 4121.839
right

4119.52 --> 4124.080000000001
but they're also like very

4121.839 --> 4126.159
a lot of them like really get developed

4124.08 --> 4128.719
phobias sometimes it's even like the

4126.159 --> 4130.719
phobia of just dealing with people the

4128.719 --> 4134.64
whole items about it

4130.719 --> 4134.64
because that's real so yeah

4135.04 --> 4138.799
if people are afraid oh word might catch

4137.759 --> 4141.279
something yeah you're gonna wear that

4138.799 --> 4143.199
stupid mask

4141.279 --> 4145.52
but that's not because it's densely

4143.199 --> 4148.08
populated that's because they're phobic

4145.52 --> 4152.6
and they don't get it

4148.08 --> 4152.6
they're just afraid of infection

4163.04 --> 4166.239
it's about honor for the way they try

4164.719 --> 4168.08
not to call in sick okay well that's

4166.239 --> 4170.3189999999995
enough that's a cultural issue if they

4168.08 --> 4174.199
actually don't call in sick and keep

4170.319 --> 4174.1990000000005
working even if they're sick

4196.56 --> 4200.719
yeah surface day it's yeah you're not

4198.96 --> 4203.199
we're not talking about the same thing

4200.719 --> 4205.04
we're not talking about oh japanese

4203.199 --> 4208.159
wearing masks because they've been told

4205.04 --> 4210.719
to this is like way before corona it's

4208.159 --> 4213.36
been going on for a while

4210.719 --> 4215.36
but i do know a lot of japanese are like

4213.36 --> 4218.0
germophobic

4215.36 --> 4220.08
a lot of japanese are phobic about a

4218.0 --> 4221.52
whole bunch of things

4220.08 --> 4225.28
it's kind of a

4221.52 --> 4225.280000000001
like a cultural problem i guess

4225.76 --> 4233.4400000000005
and it yeah was way before corona ever

4229.12 --> 4233.44
supposedly happened way before that

4239.12 --> 4244.88
do you know a lot of japanese people no

4241.6 --> 4247.120000000001
and i've never been to japan

4244.88 --> 4247.12
but

4247.76 --> 4250.8
i like japan

4252.159 --> 4258.759999999999
there's something about it

4255.12 --> 4258.76
about all of it

4258.8 --> 4263.04
about its energy

4260.48 --> 4265.678999999999
about its honor culture

4263.04 --> 4268.159
about its respect to its elders that is

4265.679 --> 4270.2390000000005
not like they're not letting that be

4268.159 --> 4272.639999999999
taken away and people that don't

4270.239 --> 4275.12
disrespect elders and universally are

4272.64 --> 4276.88
greatly scoffed at

4275.12 --> 4280.08
i think that's great

4276.88 --> 4282.400000000001
i really like that about it

4280.08 --> 4284.719
so yeah i don't know i've just

4282.4 --> 4287.719
a personal affinity for japan in many

4284.719 --> 4287.719
ways

4313.04 --> 4315.84
any flat fellow

4317.76 --> 4324.96
yeah i did know somebody

4320.88 --> 4325.92
whose brother has been to japan

4324.96 --> 4328.4800000000005
and

4325.92 --> 4331.6
we were talking about japan like and i'm

4328.48 --> 4334.5599999999995
talking about 15 years ago

4331.6 --> 4334.56
20 years ago

4334.8 --> 4340.92
so i've been

4336.32 --> 4340.92
interested in japan for a while

4344.08 --> 4348.64
i guess

4346.0 --> 4351.28
that yeah well things like

4348.64 --> 4353.679
transformers originally coming from

4351.28 --> 4356.4
there g1

4353.679 --> 4359.04
and

4356.4 --> 4362.5599999999995
well the movie akira made it like a

4359.04 --> 4362.56
massive impact on me

4362.88 --> 4366.96
and that's very japanese

4365.44 --> 4368.239
so yeah

4366.96 --> 4370.32
just

4368.239 --> 4372.4
getting to know things from japan i've

4370.32 --> 4375.4
really appreciated it all throughout my

4372.4 --> 4375.4
life

4393.6 --> 4396.719
yeah but surface day i don't know why

4395.6 --> 4400.2390000000005
you're doing it

4396.719 --> 4401.44
china and japan are absolutely nothing

4400.239 --> 4405.199
alike

4401.44 --> 4407.678999999999
they're completely different you cannot

4405.199 --> 4411.599999999999
put them in the same basket you cannot

4407.679 --> 4414.4
do that that's always going to be wrong

4411.6 --> 4415.360000000001
they're very very different in so many

4414.4 --> 4418.799999999999
ways

4415.36 --> 4421.12
you can't put them in the same basket

4418.8 --> 4425.64
never

4421.12 --> 4425.64
like they wouldn't appreciate it

4430.8 --> 4434.320000000001
right

4431.679 --> 4439.08
yeah in china that happens in japan no

4434.32 --> 4439.08
it doesn't happen not like that

4441.6 --> 4447.120000000001
because yeah japan never had a communist

4444.48 --> 4447.12
revolution

4447.36 --> 4451.0
they're very different

4454.8 --> 4461.04
they both use chopsticks

4457.6 --> 4461.04
yeah okay okay

4461.199 --> 4464.678999999999
give you that

4473.84 --> 4476.84
no

4482.48 --> 4488.239
yeah well by that standard

4485.199 --> 4489.44
yeah so is the united states and so are

4488.239 --> 4491.04
we

4489.44 --> 4494.04
it has nothing to do with them as a

4491.04 --> 4494.04
people

4516.719 --> 4521.56
thank you for your service godzilla one

4524.0 --> 4526.64
oh god

4526.88 --> 4529.4400000000005
mothra

4532.48 --> 4536.959999999999
am i a fan of asian food

4535.04 --> 4539.84
not particularly

4536.96 --> 4539.84
steamy traveler

4548.88 --> 4553.08
like

4549.92 --> 4553.08
i mean

4553.28 --> 4557.04
i like

4555.12 --> 4559.679
i'm more of a fan in the direction of

4557.04 --> 4562.239
indonesian food

4559.679 --> 4564.4800000000005
i like that i to be fair i've never

4562.239 --> 4566.4
really liked japanese food

4564.48 --> 4567.839999999999
and hey if they like that

4566.4 --> 4569.44
go for it

4567.84 --> 4572.08
go for it

4569.44 --> 4575.28
but i don't like japanese food i don't

4572.08 --> 4577.44
like the taste of i don't like sushi

4575.28 --> 4580.48
they have nothing against it i just

4577.44 --> 4583.04
don't really like it

4580.48 --> 4586.32
and like chinese food as long as there's

4583.04 --> 4588.56
no fried spiders and

4586.32 --> 4589.599999999999
pig and everything

4588.56 --> 4592.0
yeah

4589.6 --> 4593.280000000001
i've eaten that and was like yeah that's

4592.0 --> 4595.6
okay

4593.28 --> 4597.36
but since i've eaten

4595.6 --> 4600.88
started to decide to

4597.36 --> 4602.5599999999995
since i've started eating organic only

4600.88 --> 4605.36
i haven't like

4602.56 --> 4607.84
gone to any restaurants chinese rest

4605.36 --> 4610.799999999999
like there's no organic chinese food

4607.84 --> 4613.04
people there is it there just isn't

4610.8 --> 4616.400000000001
and there isn't any

4613.04 --> 4618.159
organic indonesian food either so i'd

4616.4 --> 4621.639999999999
have to just make it myself and that's

4618.159 --> 4621.639999999999
what i've been doing

4622.08 --> 4626.08
and that's freaking delicious

4624.239 --> 4629.919999999999
because you can do that

4626.08 --> 4629.92
but you gotta make it yourself

4631.28 --> 4636.32
all right see you later service day

4633.76 --> 4639.679
thanks for popping by

4636.32 --> 4642.239
thai food oh yeah yeah my brother my

4639.679 --> 4645.76
half brother was a big fan of thai food

4642.239 --> 4647.28
he made some really great like thai soup

4645.76 --> 4649.1990000000005
hot soup

4647.28 --> 4650.639999999999
hot peppery soup i really like that

4649.199 --> 4652.239
stuff

4650.64 --> 4655.4400000000005
i haven't eaten that

4652.239 --> 4655.44
20 years though but

4662.719 --> 4667.52
i've never had indonesian food before

4665.12 --> 4669.199
what are some main dishes

4667.52 --> 4670.8
uh

4669.199 --> 4673.678999999999
well

4670.8 --> 4673.679
it's typically

4674.48 --> 4680.799999999999
some kind of meat

4676.32 --> 4680.799999999999
in like thick spicy sauces

4681.28 --> 4688.719
with a lot of ginger and peppers of all

4684.88 --> 4689.84
kinds and other stuff it's

4688.719 --> 4691.679
yeah

4689.84 --> 4693.4400000000005
with rice

4691.679 --> 4695.36
and that's

4693.44 --> 4698.0
that's like the range of my knowledge

4695.36 --> 4699.36
it's just things that i like

4698.0 --> 4702.239
that i make

4699.36 --> 4703.44
that are typically indonesian

4702.239 --> 4706.879999999999
apparently

4703.44 --> 4709.12
so you just have like rice and then like

4706.88 --> 4710.719
meat in like really

4709.12 --> 4714.159
yeah super

4710.719 --> 4715.52
herbish spicy

4714.159 --> 4717.12
sauce

4715.52 --> 4719.040000000001
and it's great stuff

4717.12 --> 4722.5599999999995
i guess that some people would say oh

4719.04 --> 4725.84
but that's exactly like chinese food

4722.56 --> 4729.6
sort of but it is still different

4725.84 --> 4729.6
chinese is much more about like

4730.64 --> 4736.159000000001
other stuff they use i don't know i

4732.64 --> 4737.52
don't know maybe it's very similar

4736.159 --> 4740.32
i mean

4737.52 --> 4742.320000000001
they're like kind of in the same region

4740.32 --> 4744.32
and there is even like restaurants out

4742.32 --> 4746.0
there that are not just chinese

4744.32 --> 4748.719
restaurants they're

4746.0 --> 4751.04
chinese indonesian restaurants probably

4748.719 --> 4752.159
because of that reason because they do

4751.04 --> 4754.64
kind of

4752.159 --> 4757.879999999999
border each other

4754.64 --> 4757.88
in style

4764.32 --> 4766.5599999999995
hmm

4771.28 --> 4775.84
right yeah the spices in the thai food

4774.239 --> 4777.28
are very different you're right i

4775.84 --> 4779.28
recognize the

4777.28 --> 4782.719
the lemongrass

4779.28 --> 4782.719
it's very typical in that

4782.8 --> 4787.4400000000005
and a lot of things that i i practically

4785.04 --> 4790.679
don't even know what that is but it it's

4787.44 --> 4790.678999999999
pretty good

4798.159 --> 4803.08
asian fusion cuisines yeah

4809.76 --> 4813.52
right but one of the things that i like

4811.679 --> 4814.96
to make

4813.52 --> 4817.6
which are

4814.96 --> 4820.0
based on originally on indonesian

4817.6 --> 4821.6
kitchen that i kind of got from my dad

4820.0 --> 4825.04
who

4821.6 --> 4827.360000000001
made it into his thing based on what you

4825.04 --> 4829.6
can get at certain old-fashioned

4827.36 --> 4830.839999999999
indonesian restaurants

4829.6 --> 4834.08
that

4830.84 --> 4837.04
is ketchup

4834.08 --> 4839.6
and normally they have like that with

4837.04 --> 4842.56
pig i use chicken so it's like chicken

4839.6 --> 4842.56
ketchup and it's

4843.52 --> 4846.75
chicken

4845.12 --> 4848.32
in

4846.75 --> 4850.719
[Music]

4848.32 --> 4850.719
it's like

4850.8 --> 4855.360000000001
garlic

4852.48 --> 4858.32
salt pepper lots of it and then ginger

4855.36 --> 4860.4
oh my god the ginger like in every form

4858.32 --> 4864.5599999999995
you can find

4860.4 --> 4867.199
ginger powder fresh ginger root cut

4864.56 --> 4867.1990000000005
cut root

4867.52 --> 4871.120000000001
ginger

4868.639 --> 4871.12
syrup

4876.639 --> 4881.04
all of that and just let it really let

4879.28 --> 4883.36
it soak in

4881.04 --> 4886.08
make sure to balance it out properly the

4883.36 --> 4887.12
taste so you have to like use vinegar in

4886.08 --> 4890.639
there

4887.12 --> 4893.76
because otherwise it'll get too sweet

4890.639 --> 4894.639
and yeah that with rice and maybe like

4893.76 --> 4896.639
uh

4894.639 --> 4897.36
sambal bunches

4896.639 --> 4899.04
with

4897.36 --> 4902.88
sambal or

4899.04 --> 4905.28
how do you call that in english god with

4902.88 --> 4906.08
like green beans

4905.28 --> 4908.639
in

4906.08 --> 4910.5599999999995
very spicy sauce

4908.639 --> 4913.84
like next to that

4910.56 --> 4917.280000000001
that is a really delicious meal

4913.84 --> 4919.1990000000005
but you're gonna be hot hot hot

4917.28 --> 4922.88
and that's like one of my favorites i

4919.199 --> 4922.879999999999
make that i'm really good at that

4922.96 --> 4927.36
all right yeah it's a lot of food talk

4925.76 --> 4931.08
okay see you later steamy traveler

4927.36 --> 4931.08
thanks for popping by

4932.0 --> 4936.4
does asian meals without msg what the

4935.199 --> 4938.638999999999
[ __ ]

4936.4 --> 4941.36
why are you disappointed in that msg is

4938.639 --> 4941.36
really bad for

4942.84 --> 4949.360000000001
you oh god i might now get that crazy

4947.12 --> 4951.5199999999995
msg guy back in chat

4949.36 --> 4953.44
remember that guys

4951.52 --> 4955.4400000000005
when i said like msg is really bad for

4953.44 --> 4957.678999999999
you and he's like how dare you

4955.44 --> 4959.678999999999
there's nothing wrong with msg

4957.679 --> 4962.0
damn it

4959.679 --> 4964.4800000000005
irwin's crazy he thinks that msg is

4962.0 --> 4964.48
toxic

4965.199 --> 4969.5199999999995
remember that who the hell was that guy

4967.92 --> 4970.84
anyway

4969.52 --> 4972.400000000001
yeah but it's not

4970.84 --> 4975.52
healthy

4972.4 --> 4975.5199999999995
king of flavors

4978.48 --> 4982.718999999999
it's a uh

4981.36 --> 4984.639
what is called

4982.719 --> 4986.56
a neurotoxin

4984.639 --> 4989.4400000000005
is what it is a kumo virus it's

4986.56 --> 4993.04
classified as a neurotoxin

4989.44 --> 4994.879999999999
because in your system it fools your

4993.04 --> 4996.96
metabolism

4994.88 --> 4999.36
and stomach senses

4996.96 --> 5002.159
into thinking you're more hungry even

4999.36 --> 5004.719
though you might be full it artificially

5002.159 --> 5006.879999999999
enhances your hunger senses yeah that's

5004.719 --> 5009.28
very pleasurable

5006.88 --> 5011.52
it's not natural though and it's not

5009.28 --> 5013.92
healthy

5011.52 --> 5015.76
it breaks down in your liver in

5013.92 --> 5018.08
compounds

5015.76 --> 5018.08
that

5018.159 --> 5021.679
like

5019.04 --> 5022.719
are not good for you and they make you

5021.679 --> 5024.32
fat

5022.719 --> 5026.96
literally

5024.32 --> 5029.199
it leaches out bioaccumulates

5026.96 --> 5032.08
into your fats

5029.199 --> 5034.48
it's a burden on your liver

5032.08 --> 5036.5599999999995
it's not healthy

5034.48 --> 5037.599999999999
and if you take too much

5036.56 --> 5039.76
and this is

5037.6 --> 5042.400000000001
it doesn't really happen that much

5039.76 --> 5044.719
anymore i think and in the past it was

5042.4 --> 5047.5199999999995
not uncommon

5044.719 --> 5049.92
like in the 20th century past

5047.52 --> 5051.360000000001
that people would go to like a chinese

5049.92 --> 5053.6
restaurant

5051.36 --> 5054.799999999999
eat a meal and then die from a freaking

5053.6 --> 5058.56
heart attack

5054.8 --> 5058.56
because they had too much msg

5058.639 --> 5060.96
really

5064.719 --> 5070.4
you can get a heart attack if you like

5066.48 --> 5072.08
get too much of it

5070.4 --> 5074.0
if you

5072.08 --> 5076.639
are susceptible like if you're like

5074.0 --> 5078.88
super sportsman with absolutely no heart

5076.639 --> 5082.08
problems you never took a v right you

5078.88 --> 5084.32
don't have any other stupid things

5082.08 --> 5086.0
yeah then you could probably take msg a

5084.32 --> 5088.719
whole bunch

5086.0 --> 5090.0
but if you have any kind of heart issues

5088.719 --> 5093.12
msg

5090.0 --> 5093.12
could be quite dangerous

5094.32 --> 5100.159
like even a bag of like

5097.12 --> 5103.36
regular chips with flavor

5100.159 --> 5106.159
a lot of it has msg if you just

5103.36 --> 5108.159
chug down that entire bag well you

5106.159 --> 5111.28
probably get sick

5108.159 --> 5114.48
but you could also literally get heart

5111.28 --> 5114.48
palpitations and [ __ ]

5116.639 --> 5121.04
like as a young kid i had that sometimes

5122.159 --> 5127.839999999999
because i did definitely like chug down

5124.56 --> 5127.84
bags of chips

5129.28 --> 5132.5599999999995
i don't do that anymore

5136.0 --> 5141.36
right and also by the way that doesn't

5138.239 --> 5144.08
happen with just regular salt

5141.36 --> 5145.5199999999995
like even refined table salt which is

5144.08 --> 5147.44
not healthy

5145.52 --> 5148.719
that doesn't happen

5147.44 --> 5150.32
not like that

5148.719 --> 5152.56
yeah you get higher blood pressure

5150.32 --> 5156.88
pressure it's not going to be good but

5152.56 --> 5156.88
like msg is like different

5159.12 --> 5162.4
impact is much higher

5163.12 --> 5167.5599999999995
you can overdose on that [ __ ]

5169.76 --> 5174.639
you so you can also do that with table

5171.92 --> 5177.1990000000005
salt by the way but yeah you'll taste it

5174.639 --> 5179.92
it'll just be really really really salty

5177.199 --> 5183.799999999999
you'll taste it

5179.92 --> 5183.8
the taste will be off

5185.199 --> 5188.96
anyway

5187.44 --> 5192.719
excitotoxin

5188.96 --> 5192.719
yeah but neurotoxin

5194.239 --> 5198.48
it's a neural influencer

5199.679 --> 5202.08
anyway

5203.6 --> 5207.280000000001
it's one of the many additives that it

5205.52 --> 5208.080000000001
intended to kill you

5207.28 --> 5211.12
no

5208.08 --> 5212.639
no that's not what msg was for msg was

5211.12 --> 5215.5199999999995
originally

5212.639 --> 5218.0
it was invented by japan i think

5215.52 --> 5219.92
in second world war

5218.0 --> 5223.199
to be able to

5219.92 --> 5223.1990000000005
conserve food

5223.52 --> 5228.2390000000005
and still make it tasty enough so you

5225.84 --> 5230.4800000000005
could take like meat

5228.239 --> 5232.5599999999995
grind it up it would be kind of past

5230.48 --> 5235.12
exploration date and then normally yeah

5232.56 --> 5236.88
it starts to kind of taste off and

5235.12 --> 5239.04
get a bit rotty and all that really

5236.88 --> 5240.32
disgusting but they figured out if we

5239.04 --> 5244.159
then

5240.32 --> 5246.08
while processing it throw msg in it

5244.159 --> 5248.799999999999
people will eat it and they'll they'll

5246.08 --> 5251.679
think it's great

5248.8 --> 5253.52
that's why they did it

5251.679 --> 5255.679
as a yeah

5253.52 --> 5255.679
to

5255.84 --> 5263.56
as a taste enhancer for

5258.56 --> 5263.56
stored foods especially meat

5273.92 --> 5278.84
right it's it's not like uh

5277.84 --> 5282.08
not like

5278.84 --> 5283.28
aspartame right aspartame artificial

5282.08 --> 5284.96
sweetener

5283.28 --> 5285.84
from the 90s

5284.96 --> 5289.6
yeah

5285.84 --> 5290.4800000000005
that stuff was actually invented

5289.6 --> 5292.2390000000005
not

5290.48 --> 5294.879999999999
like oh we gotta

5292.239 --> 5297.199
enhance the food no no that was

5294.88 --> 5299.36
an accidental invention

5297.199 --> 5300.799999999999
when they were making

5299.36 --> 5302.0
weapons

5300.8 --> 5303.84
yeah

5302.0 --> 5306.48
chemical weapons

5303.84 --> 5306.4800000000005
that's where

5307.44 --> 5312.32
uh i lost the name

5309.92 --> 5314.2300000000005
what did i say

5312.32 --> 5316.32
artificial sweetener

5314.23 --> 5318.08
[Music]

5316.32 --> 5320.88
damn it i just said it

5318.08 --> 5324.239
somebody type it out in chat right now

5320.88 --> 5326.719
before i lose my train of thought

5324.239 --> 5326.718999999999
did i say

5329.92 --> 5333.88
i hate it when that happens

5339.6 --> 5344.96
aspartame thank you thank you thank you

5341.84 --> 5348.56
thank you yeah aspartame

5344.96 --> 5349.84
is not like msg msg was invented

5348.56 --> 5352.2390000000005
to

5349.84 --> 5355.52
yeah help the food situation

5352.239 --> 5357.44
aspartame was invented as a chemical

5355.52 --> 5359.120000000001
weapon

5357.44 --> 5361.759999999999
and then they figured out hey this stuff

5359.12 --> 5364.4
is kind of sweet

5361.76 --> 5366.159000000001
and then rumsfeld donald rumsfeld

5364.4 --> 5368.32
decided oh

5366.159 --> 5369.92
let's turn it into an artificial

5368.32 --> 5372.159
sweetener

5369.92 --> 5373.679
and then the company nutrasweet was

5372.159 --> 5376.719
invented

5373.679 --> 5380.2390000000005
and then we got all that crap yeah but

5376.719 --> 5382.719
it was never originally designed

5380.239 --> 5385.44
concocted as an artificial sweetener

5382.719 --> 5387.52
that just happened to be a side effect

5385.44 --> 5389.5199999999995
when they were developing it as a

5387.52 --> 5392.52
chemical weapon

5389.52 --> 5392.52
okay

5394.239 --> 5397.36
thank you america

5402.88 --> 5408.32
sweet and now um

5406.0 --> 5409.92
sure

5408.32 --> 5412.32
dude but since then there's like all

5409.92 --> 5414.96
kinds of different

5412.32 --> 5416.799999999999
branches of aspartame aspartame is just

5414.96 --> 5418.56
the original substance but there's now

5416.8 --> 5423.04
like

5418.56 --> 5423.04
dozens and dozens of different types

5423.92 --> 5426.56
and

5424.719 --> 5429.04
like to bypass

5426.56 --> 5432.080000000001
safety hazards with aspartame

5429.04 --> 5434.4
regulations they then mix in the

5432.08 --> 5435.76
different types of aspartame

5434.4 --> 5439.28
so that

5435.76 --> 5441.52
separately none of them go over the

5439.28 --> 5444.0
allowed amount

5441.52 --> 5446.4800000000005
but the combination of it all is like

5444.0 --> 5449.36
way worse

5446.48 --> 5452.239
and that's yeah

5449.36 --> 5455.199
that's how you get really fat

5452.239 --> 5455.199
really quickly

5455.76 --> 5461.6
it bloats you up

5458.56 --> 5464.88
because aspartame is really terrible

5461.6 --> 5467.360000000001
like it breaks down into severely toxic

5464.88 --> 5468.96
substances in your body

5467.36 --> 5472.719
formaldehyde

5468.96 --> 5476.679
being one of the primary ones and that's

5472.719 --> 5476.679
really bad for you

5478.0 --> 5482.32
so yeah

5480.0 --> 5484.96
if you want something that's sweet just

5482.32 --> 5485.92
take the damn sugar

5484.96 --> 5487.52
just

5485.92 --> 5490.159
if you're gonna insist on having

5487.52 --> 5492.56
something sweet then just take the sugar

5490.159 --> 5495.12
you can't have your sweets

5492.56 --> 5497.679
and then oh i don't want the calories or

5495.12 --> 5499.5199999999995
that sound nonsense

5497.679 --> 5502.8
absolute [ __ ] like oh i don't want

5499.52 --> 5506.080000000001
the calories so i'm gonna take

5502.8 --> 5507.679
chemical weapon stuff instead oh that's

5506.08 --> 5510.88
so smart

5507.679 --> 5512.56
such a brilliant idea

5510.88 --> 5515.88
oh that'll help

5512.56 --> 5515.88
no it doesn't

5549.12 --> 5553.679
right

5550.639 --> 5556.96
well today's been all about the food

5553.679 --> 5556.96
and the chemtrails at first

5558.32 --> 5563.04
but i'm gonna round out the show

5561.52 --> 5564.080000000001
oh

5563.04 --> 5568.04
man

5564.08 --> 5568.04
barely taking any teeth

5581.04 --> 5584.04
uh

5590.239 --> 5594.4
right

5591.76 --> 5594.400000000001
so yeah

5595.12 --> 5600.08
thanks everyone for coming i hope you

5597.679 --> 5603.12
like this show it's kind of like general

5600.08 --> 5605.6
talk today but that's fine you know

5603.12 --> 5607.12
it's good to do that as well

5605.6 --> 5610.719
every now and then

5607.12 --> 5613.5199999999995
don't always have to be like specialist

5610.719 --> 5615.36
flat earth technical subjects

5613.52 --> 5617.040000000001
there's plenty of that out there already

5615.36 --> 5619.199
other people are really digging into

5617.04 --> 5621.04
that i've had my face

5619.199 --> 5622.799999999999
you know i've been doing this for like

5621.04 --> 5626.08
six years now and

5622.8 --> 5627.84
this specific show for three years

5626.08 --> 5629.12
every day

5627.84 --> 5633.12
so

5629.12 --> 5635.679
yeah i can't just keep on talking about

5633.12 --> 5637.199
flat earth technicals all the time i

5635.679 --> 5641.12
would

5637.199 --> 5643.199
get bored out of my mind if i did that

5641.12 --> 5645.04
not because it's boring but it because

5643.199 --> 5647.678999999999
it's boring to just repeat the same

5645.04 --> 5650.4
thing over and over again and see

5647.679 --> 5654.639
same amount of trolls getting triggered

5650.4 --> 5655.36
by it over and over again it annoys me

5654.639 --> 5656.8
but

5655.36 --> 5658.96
that doesn't mean that i don't talk

5656.8 --> 5661.28
about it every now and then

5658.96 --> 5663.84
especially if something relevant new

5661.28 --> 5663.84
comes up

5663.92 --> 5667.92
right if any of you bring up bring it up

5666.239 --> 5671.199
i'll talk about it

5667.92 --> 5674.4800000000005
and that includes flat earth

5671.199 --> 5676.48
so thanks everyone for coming i hope you

5674.48 --> 5678.48
liked this show if you did then please
