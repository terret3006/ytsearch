116.7 --> 123.06
clouds very sparing

119.28 --> 124.86
no rain clouds definitely there has been

123.06 --> 126.299
a lot of trailing though it's still

124.86 --> 128.759
happening

126.299 --> 133.14000000000001
there's like blatant

128.759 --> 136.04
Trail bands being spread out and

133.14 --> 136.04
up there

138.3 --> 142.26000000000002
like

140.28 --> 144.42
but yeah despite that it's really nice

142.26 --> 147.5
weather outside

144.42 --> 147.5
very little wind

150.54 --> 158.29999999999998
so yeah nice summers day

154.62 --> 158.3
here in the Netherlands

162.959 --> 168.14000000000001
low flutter Sage first in chat good to

165.84 --> 168.14000000000001
see you

168.36 --> 176.34
it is Thursday the 2nd of June 2022.

173.7 --> 179.57999999999998
and yeah

176.34 --> 181.019
yesterday I didn't have a show

179.58 --> 183.9
so

181.019 --> 187.019
how many people may have noticed that

183.9 --> 189.68
I've got a question from steamy traveler

187.019 --> 189.68
over Skype

189.98 --> 195.11999999999998
but uh yeah no I was I had a day off

193.98 --> 198.23899999999998
yesterday

195.12 --> 200.94
because I was kind of sick

198.239 --> 203.459
that Tuesday was

200.94 --> 205.98
a weird Wild

203.459 --> 207.84
day

205.98 --> 209.39999999999998
lots of exciting things happening

207.84 --> 213.98
overall and

209.4 --> 213.98000000000002
yeah I got a bit carried away and then

215.04 --> 223.07999999999998
ended up not feeling too great yesterday

219.42 --> 225.95899999999997
but I was able to get through it

223.08 --> 228.0
like I basically spent the show time and

225.959 --> 230.22
even like the life letters debates time

228.0 --> 233.54
sleeping

230.22 --> 233.54
because yeah

234.72 --> 238.2
all right I had been up in the morning

236.34 --> 240.06
sick

238.2 --> 242.819
but then

240.06 --> 245.12
yeah I was able to get that under

242.819 --> 248.04
control and just like really power nap

245.12 --> 250.56
through the Regeneration process felt a

248.04 --> 253.14
lot better after that and today I feel

250.56 --> 255.84
fine so

253.14 --> 257.959
uh

255.84 --> 257.959
okay

259.139 --> 266.84000000000003
all right also yeah my healer is back

263.639 --> 266.84000000000003
that was pretty awesome

267.78 --> 273.17999999999995
and uh yeah

270.36 --> 276.12
had a checkup with him as well I was

273.18 --> 278.3
doing actually pretty good

276.12 --> 282.36
and funnily enough

278.3 --> 284.52000000000004
I recommended blueberry to him

282.36 --> 286.74
and it was really fascinating his

284.52 --> 288.71999999999997
response because when I first started

286.74 --> 290.52
yeah it first started asking like yeah

288.72 --> 291.96000000000004
do you even watch movies anymore and

290.52 --> 295.02
he's like no no

291.96 --> 297.18
really don't have a TV even and

295.02 --> 298.919
it was like okay but

297.18 --> 301.02
because there is this one movie called

298.919 --> 304.979
blueberry and I think it's like really

301.02 --> 307.919
good actually a good movie that's

304.979 --> 309.18
quite unique in this time in this time

307.919 --> 311.639
frame

309.18 --> 316.68
with how it was made

311.639 --> 319.32
and then as I was explaining it like his

316.68 --> 323.34000000000003
guide told him

319.32 --> 325.38
whoa that's a good movie it's just he

323.34 --> 326.88
told me like my guide's telling me this

325.38 --> 327.78
is actually a good movie so I was like

326.88 --> 330.0
oh

327.78 --> 332.88
all right

330.0 --> 336.419
cool yeah by the way when I say his

332.88 --> 339.24
guide that means basically Spirit guides

336.419 --> 340.5
but it's really interesting when when I

339.24 --> 342.66
get like

340.5 --> 344.539
responses through him about something

342.66 --> 347.34000000000003
that he technically doesn't know about

344.539 --> 349.02
and then his guides tell

347.34 --> 350.58
something about it is always very

349.02 --> 353.28
fascinating

350.58 --> 355.74
because there

353.28 --> 357.71999999999997
pretty much always right

355.74 --> 360.139
so it's kind of cool to First hear

357.72 --> 363.12
somebody like oh um

360.139 --> 365.40000000000003
wait it's about Ayahuasca well got a lot

363.12 --> 368.52
of people that have issues with that I

365.4 --> 371.15999999999997
was like but this is not like

368.52 --> 372.78
telling you to do it the wrong way

371.16 --> 375.24
it's not even telling you what it is

372.78 --> 378.17999999999995
it's not about that and then his guys

375.24 --> 380.639
just piped up apparently with him until

378.18 --> 384.68
like no this is actually a really good

380.639 --> 384.68
movie that's so funny

384.84 --> 390.17999999999995
to me

386.88 --> 391.68
but also yeah I am calling it it is a

390.18 --> 395.539
good movie it is kind of special

391.68 --> 395.539
especially for this time period

397.139 --> 400.22
so that happened

403.08 --> 405.68
all right

410.699 --> 415.86
another thing that happened

413.22 --> 419.12
is

415.86 --> 419.12
on today's show

420.9 --> 426.44
another

422.699 --> 426.44
five minutes of silence

428.16 --> 432.0
letter Sage apparently is the only one

430.44 --> 434.18
here

432.0 --> 434.18
foreign

437.13 --> 440.15999999999997
[Music]

448.639 --> 454.44
also I did unban Godzilla

452.22 --> 457.8
again

454.44 --> 459.9
because he kept on paypaling me

457.8 --> 463.02000000000004
basically

459.9 --> 465.29999999999995
and yeah he didn't he didn't just

463.02 --> 467.4
overtly apologize I think he might have

465.3 --> 468.41900000000004
some like character issues in doing such

467.4 --> 470.21999999999997
things

468.419 --> 472.56
but

470.22 --> 475.46000000000004
I think he got the message overall so I

472.56 --> 475.46
just unbanned him again

476.699 --> 482.36
low Terror 306 Shatner's bassoon good to

480.06 --> 482.36
see you

485.12 --> 488.24
[Music]

488.52 --> 493.44
right yeah my show title for today was

490.919 --> 495.96
actually meant for yesterday based on

493.44 --> 500.599
things that I was talking about

495.96 --> 500.599
in chat and Jim Bob's on Tuesday

502.979 --> 505.58
foreign

512.779 --> 516.2
yes you have

516.539 --> 522.5
he hadn't even picked up on that I gave

518.64 --> 522.5
one to you like weeks ago

523.1 --> 526.21
[Music]

527.64 --> 531.26
right so anyway yesterday

531.36 --> 536.94
letters debate was interesting so I

534.06 --> 540.7399999999999
heard even though I only popped in after

536.94 --> 540.74
the live show was over

542.82 --> 547.58
Jim Bob that evening was also pretty

545.339 --> 547.58
cool

550.26 --> 555.12
I really like started I was hammering on

553.2 --> 558.1800000000001
Brenda yesterday

555.12 --> 559.92
in chat like really hard and she was

558.18 --> 561.899
deserving it

559.92 --> 564.36
because she was saying things that were

561.899 --> 566.94
so unbelievably stupid

564.36 --> 569.339
that it's just enough fence

566.94 --> 572.1600000000001
she was basically

569.339 --> 574.08
in the chat chat skanking she didn't

572.16 --> 577.14
really seem to want to come on with Jim

574.08 --> 581.4590000000001
Bob again saying that

577.14 --> 584.04
well presuppositions is just saying

581.459 --> 585.0
something is like that and she just got

584.04 --> 588.3
it wrong

585.0 --> 591.959
when I mean she's been grilled about

588.3 --> 594.779
that for several hours

591.959 --> 596.76
all together over a time span of five

594.779 --> 598.98
years to really know what a

596.76 --> 600.36
presupposition is and she just got it

598.98 --> 603.32
wrong

600.36 --> 606.1800000000001
right so I started hammering on that

603.32 --> 608.7
Nathan style as Nathan would do in chats

606.18 --> 610.92
right really hammer on it and guess what

608.7 --> 614.76
there were a lot of people watching that

610.92 --> 617.8199999999999
yeah and Brandon was just like ah oops

614.76 --> 619.92
ignoring me going into a conversation

617.82 --> 621.839
with somebody else and persistently

619.92 --> 624.12
ignoring me as I spent 10 minutes

621.839 --> 627.0
straight telling everybody how

624.12 --> 629.1
incredibly [ __ ] stupid she is and why

627.0 --> 632.22
exactly and that she should know this

629.1 --> 636.3000000000001
how she got it wrong how unbelievably

632.22 --> 638.82
dense Brenda is and not smart

636.3 --> 641.88
because she can't even get like a

638.82 --> 642.9590000000001
foundational Concept in academics

641.88 --> 646.62
correctly

642.959 --> 648.42
like um can't get more fundamentally

646.62 --> 650.76
basic

648.42 --> 652.5
than understanding what a presupposition

650.76 --> 654.42
is

652.5 --> 656.82
so yeah

654.42 --> 658.56
it's a bit of Vengeance on my side and

656.82 --> 661.2
she really deserves because she is a

658.56 --> 662.3389999999999
dumb [ __ ] she really doesn't know

661.2 --> 665.6400000000001
anything

662.339 --> 668.399
she has like technobabble skills

665.64 --> 671.279
but the only thing she really does is

668.399 --> 673.459
get things wrong and then double down on

671.279 --> 673.459
them

673.5 --> 679.16
ah

676.14 --> 679.16
so that happened

682.99 --> 688.6800000000001
[Music]

685.079 --> 694.92
also apparently

688.68 --> 697.56
the Amber Heard Saga is finally over

694.92 --> 700.14
as everybody was like oh Jesus

697.56 --> 701.9399999999999
verdict verdict oh and then like it

700.14 --> 704.04
wasn't even clear what was going on and

701.94 --> 706.019
everybody even kept talking about it for

704.04 --> 707.6999999999999
hours on end everybody's confused

706.019 --> 710.12
because nobody even understood what the

707.7 --> 710.12
hell happened

710.7 --> 716.339
only today that I managed to read some

714.18 --> 718.6389999999999
articles about it basically saying like

716.339 --> 718.639
yeah

718.68 --> 721.6389999999999
she did lose

723.72 --> 728.6
good

725.399 --> 728.6
but God what

728.76 --> 732.98
what a nonsense Fest that is

737.82 --> 744.44
halfway into the movie

740.279 --> 744.4399999999999
what halfway okay

746.399 --> 750.44
all right did you get one with subtitles

750.72 --> 756.2
screen stuck oh [ __ ] thanks for telling

754.079 --> 756.1999999999999
me

786.839 --> 791.82
it was in English

789.06 --> 794.279
did it have English subtitles

791.82 --> 796.519
because yeah I know the movies in

794.279 --> 796.519
English

797.779 --> 803.3
oh goody

800.519 --> 803.3
ah

810.0 --> 816.18
I

811.8 --> 820.0999999999999
oh goody so yeah halfway yeah that's

816.18 --> 820.0999999999999
that's cool that means you

820.199 --> 824.5999999999999
barely know really what's happening then

835.96 --> 839.119
[Music]

845.48 --> 849.1
[Music]

864.48 --> 867.48
foreign

872.459 --> 875.459
anyway

876.72 --> 879.32
something

880.139 --> 884.22
but I have to say by the way that the

882.54 --> 886.92
movie is

884.22 --> 890.1600000000001
Smart in a sense that

886.92 --> 893.0999999999999
this weird subtitle situation is going

890.16 --> 896.579
to really make one of people buy the DVD

893.1 --> 898.98
it makes it really worth it

896.579 --> 902.76
to actually buy the DVD which should be

898.98 --> 906.5600000000001
like dirt cheap by now anyway 2004.

902.76 --> 909.98
because it's really an advantage to have

906.56 --> 909.9799999999999
subtitles with it

938.1 --> 941.1800000000001
all right

959.399 --> 964.759
okay well everybody steps away from the

962.699 --> 968.16
chat again for three minutes straight

964.759 --> 969.779
huh let me address what the title

968.16 --> 972.959
actually means

969.779 --> 976.88
Founding Father farmer

972.959 --> 976.88
I thought it was interesting because

977.639 --> 983.16
it's three F's

980.579 --> 987.3
and

983.16 --> 989.88
it's basically pointing out all the good

987.3 --> 993.079
things that you could do

989.88 --> 997.019
right it's almost like the formula for

993.079 --> 998.7589999999999
resisting Satan at this point pounding

997.019 --> 1002.0
building

998.759 --> 1003.5
starting up like pounding like founding

1002.0 --> 1006.74
father right

1003.5 --> 1011.12
a father as in getting children

1006.74 --> 1013.759
and farmer as in making your own food

1011.12 --> 1016.339
so it's like building having children

1013.759 --> 1020.0790000000001
and growing food basically Founding

1016.339 --> 1020.0790000000001
Father farmer yeah

1020.24 --> 1023.62
I thought it was a good formula

1041.24 --> 1044.98
let's see what happens

1045.5 --> 1054.5
when I delete all banned accounts

1050.72 --> 1057.26
let's see if still nobody says anything

1054.5 --> 1060.34
still

1057.26 --> 1065.059
or five minutes straight again

1060.34 --> 1067.22
the next show after I really complained

1065.059 --> 1070.76
about it

1067.22 --> 1072.919
I mean are you just all waiting sitting

1070.76 --> 1074.179
there for me to get angry is that what

1072.919 --> 1076.64
you do now

1074.179 --> 1078.6200000000001
just bored

1076.64 --> 1081.0200000000002
silent

1078.62 --> 1084.76
waiting for me to get pissed off again

1081.02 --> 1084.76
is that what you guys are doing now

1092.48 --> 1098.059
I mean if this continues I'm going to

1095.0 --> 1102.02
end up taking all wrenches away and

1098.059 --> 1104.0
never Banning trolls and nags again do

1102.02 --> 1107.32
you understand

1104.0 --> 1107.32
that's what it's going to do

1114.5 --> 1120.46
if you guys just think that my chats

1117.98 --> 1120.46
really

1120.86 --> 1123.58
for nothing

1126.02 --> 1130.039
yeah

1127.039 --> 1131.84
and I'm really surprised at this point I

1130.039 --> 1136.22
mean there's other channels out there

1131.84 --> 1139.34
that have less Subs than me that have

1136.22 --> 1141.38
more non-stop activity during live

1139.34 --> 1143.299
streams

1141.38 --> 1148.22
you understand

1143.299 --> 1152.08
my chat is like the slowest chat that I

1148.22 --> 1152.08

1164.24 --> 1168.679
I'm not getting responses from when I'm

1167.0 --> 1171.02
talking about something

1168.679 --> 1175.76
I'm not getting input I'm not getting

1171.02 --> 1180.34
questions nobody is saying [ __ ]

1175.76 --> 1180.34
hello Tony Whitcomb yeah what's up

1182.299 --> 1187.4
and there's many people watching the

1184.46 --> 1190.4

1187.4 --> 1193.039
that can say that I can make a bot that

1190.4 --> 1195.52

1193.039 --> 1195.52

1238.039 --> 1240.28
show

1240.32 --> 1246.28
with people that say anything

1244.419 --> 1248.96

we're at the top of the knowledge well

1279.32 --> 1286.36
you're not proving that though you're

1282.26 --> 1286.36
not proving it Tony Whitcomb

1287.419 --> 1295.46
I mean if nobody says anything then what

1291.98 --> 1298.4
does how does that make you

1295.46 --> 1301.3600000000001
on top of knowledge when you literally

1298.4 --> 1301.3600000000001
don't say anything

1322.95 --> 1329.14
[Music]

1325.22 --> 1329.14
I listen while driving to work

1332.0 --> 1336.28
while riding alone all right

1338.78 --> 1342.82
yes Tony Whitcomb sorry it's

1343.4 --> 1351.38
but I mean yet look the previous show

1348.08 --> 1355.22
I told everybody never do that again

1351.38 --> 1357.919
yeah I made it explicitly clear never

1355.22 --> 1359.9
allow that to happen again do you

1357.919 --> 1363.6200000000001
understand

1359.9 --> 1365.3600000000001

1365.36 --> 1371.78
um he'll be restless oh that's cool no

1368.419 --> 1374.6000000000001
that means never do it again

1371.78 --> 1376.8999999999999
I basically didn't show up for a full

1374.6 --> 1376.8999999999999

I mean I really appreciate you guys when

1412.28 --> 1417.74
you're actually active

1414.32 --> 1422.48
but I told you last show

1417.74 --> 1425.179
I am not the radio alternative you turn

1422.48 --> 1429.34
on just to listen in the background

1425.179 --> 1429.3400000000001
that's not what this show is

1430.22 --> 1433.179
you understand

1434.659 --> 1440.24
so if you're just gonna do it anyway now

1437.419 --> 1442.72
then I do this and now you can face the

1440.24 --> 1442.72
trolls

1444.44 --> 1448.72
foreign I warned you

1449.9 --> 1454.88
and I'm being mild here

1452.72 --> 1457.039
because I meant it yesterday I really

1454.88 --> 1459.5
meant it like I

1457.039 --> 1461.12
I am getting really sick

1459.5 --> 1464.48
of the show

1461.12 --> 1468.76
of doing it if I have to stare at a chat

1464.48 --> 1468.76
for five minutes seeing nothing

1469.4 --> 1476.14
I've tried to explain it it's very

1472.4 --> 1479.72
elaborately in like the last half year

1476.14 --> 1482.8400000000001
why it's important

1479.72 --> 1486.64
that what the chat really means

1482.84 --> 1486.6399999999999
for me as a show host

1511.64 --> 1515.96
yeah not the right that's right Charlie

1513.559 --> 1519.3799999999999
Welch yeah that's what I think that's

1515.96 --> 1521.659
what I think right now some Workshop

1519.38 --> 1523.96
where it's just silent for five freaking

1521.659 --> 1523.96
minutes

1801.86 --> 1806.84
months how about that

1804.44 --> 1810.14
I mean if everybody's just gonna kind of

1806.84 --> 1812.899
like not do anything anyway you think

1810.14 --> 1814.76
that I'm then going to get Super Active

1812.899 --> 1816.5

1814.76 --> 1819.82
if everybody's just gonna hang around

1816.5 --> 1823.34
like it's it's lazy vacation time yeah

1819.82 --> 1825.559
then that's the only [ __ ] I have to

1823.34 --> 1829.48
reflect upon so that's going to be my

1825.559 --> 1829.48

1930.86 --> 1934.84

2312.82 --> 2320.02
projection you don't even know what that

2314.8 --> 2323.8590000000004
means you numpty [ __ ] Charlie Welch

2320.02 --> 2326.619
don't use words just because we have

2323.859 --> 2330.22
used them when you don't understand what

2326.619 --> 2334.32
it even [ __ ] means your numpy [ __ ]

2330.22 --> 2334.3199999999997
don't use words you don't understand

2338.38 --> 2341.88
hey Cosco homeopath

2341.92 --> 2347.8
scare the monkey boxes

2345.16 --> 2350.98
well yeah if you're going to take the

2347.8 --> 2353.38
facts you will get it

2350.98 --> 2355.9
if there's any way you will get it is by

2353.38 --> 2359.02
taking the facts for sure

2355.9 --> 2361.42
well it's like seriously increase the

2359.02 --> 2363.64
chances that you will

2361.42 --> 2366.82
but uh yeah if you hang around with the

2363.64 --> 2369.0989999999997
uh the Gay Pride Community there's a big

2366.82 --> 2370.839
bigger chance you'll get it too so

2369.099 --> 2373.5
that's a way you could contract it if

2370.839 --> 2373.5
you really want to

2383.5 --> 2391.0
Sean has more than me

2387.22 --> 2393.339
oh because right because the hobos can't

2391.0 --> 2395.02
have money right it's not like I'm

2393.339 --> 2397.42
talking about

2395.02 --> 2400.78
the behavior

2397.42 --> 2403.54
like crazy people on the streets that do

2400.78 --> 2406.42
that on purpose not because they're poor

2403.54 --> 2412.42
not I'm not talking about a beggar

2406.42 --> 2416.859
Charlie Welch you numpty [ __ ] 60 iqp

2412.42 --> 2420.46
on [ __ ] okay I'm not talking about a

2416.859 --> 2422.92
beggar I'm talking about a hobo a crazy

2420.46 --> 2423.88
person that just hangs around on the

2422.92 --> 2427.06
street

2423.88 --> 2429.2400000000002
maybe doing drugs and [ __ ] right like in

2427.06 --> 2429.24
California

2429.28 --> 2436.079
that's what I'm talking about not wealth

2432.48 --> 2436.079
you [ __ ]

2447.33 --> 2460.18
[Music]

2457.42 --> 2462.04
report it what the [ __ ] are you talking

2460.18 --> 2465.0989999999997
about reporting

2462.04 --> 2469.68
ported for what you mean I'm the [ __ ]

2465.099 --> 2473.02
[ __ ] get the [ __ ] out of my show

2469.68 --> 2476.02
you wretch

2473.02 --> 2476.02
wretch

2479.859 --> 2486.7599999999998
next time say things that make sense and

2484.3 --> 2489.7200000000003
use words that you understand you

2486.76 --> 2489.7200000000003
[ __ ] [ __ ]

2510.88 --> 2514.7400000000002
um a roof St Helens

2524.63 --> 2527.7690000000002
[Music]

2543.4 --> 2549.52
get away from monkeys

2546.64 --> 2552.1189999999997
well I think in general that would be

2549.52 --> 2552.119
good advice

2553.18 --> 2557.819
just let the monkeys be with their own

2563.74 --> 2568.72
I wonder if they're gonna have any kind

2566.02 --> 2570.88
of issue in India I mean the monkey's

2568.72 --> 2574.72
there like all these baboons they really

2570.88 --> 2577.56
like hanging or hang around the people

2574.72 --> 2577.56
a lot

2578.92 --> 2581.7400000000002
I wonder if they're going to scare it up

2580.9 --> 2586.02
there

2581.74 --> 2586.02
you know anything about that Terry 306

2617.92 --> 2622.2400000000002
.

2619.24 --> 2622.24
anyhow

2632.26 --> 2641.3390000000004
I'm happy to report kind of a general

2635.56 --> 2641.339
report I guess I guess I'll do that now

2643.42 --> 2648.819
there isn't really any other direct

2646.18 --> 2652.74
subject being rolled out but I'm

2648.819 --> 2652.74
noticing that there is like

2656.5 --> 2663.0
I think that the Netherlands is like

2658.9 --> 2663.0
really figuring out the situation

2666.64 --> 2671.2599999999998
and I wonder if there's going to be like

2668.92 --> 2674.6800000000003
an exit at some point or

2671.26 --> 2677.44
at least like the announcement of

2674.68 --> 2680.0789999999997
The Who

2677.44 --> 2682.96
in the world economic form and like the

2680.079 --> 2684.28
attachment and like the people that are

2682.96 --> 2686.079
still hanging around in our government

2684.28 --> 2689.7400000000002
doing all this [ __ ] they're like getting

2686.079 --> 2692.44
into real trouble I mean

2689.74 --> 2694.24
some of them may actually be arrested

2692.44 --> 2697.2400000000002
somewhere this year

2694.24 --> 2700.4199999999996
it might just happen I mean I'm going to

2697.24 --> 2703.72
be very careful and

2700.42 --> 2704.88
predicting that but the way

2703.72 --> 2708.0989999999997
things

2704.88 --> 2712.8
the word out there

2708.099 --> 2712.8
seems like it's getting closer

2721.3 --> 2727.599
I mean there's already like like

2723.76 --> 2730.3190000000004
reporting of criminal action

2727.599 --> 2730.319
like

2730.96 --> 2735.78
against

2732.48 --> 2735.78
for example

2738.52 --> 2747.28
uh but yeah the the public Ministry

2742.66 --> 2749.5
Minister Ministry is like not really

2747.28 --> 2752.5600000000004
responding so they're like but there's

2749.5 --> 2755.8
[ __ ] happening so like even the justice

2752.56 --> 2758.819
system could get a real slap in the face

2755.8 --> 2758.819
over all this

2761.619 --> 2766.96
and yeah if if they're just gonna

2764.2 --> 2770.46
deadlock it this might like really turn

2766.96 --> 2770.46
into some kind of revolution

2770.5 --> 2774.339
because

2771.94 --> 2776.8
it is unacceptable

2774.339 --> 2779.16
like people are really gonna lose their

2776.8 --> 2779.1600000000003
patience

2780.22 --> 2786.4599999999996
Waf got rejected by loads of yeah yeah

2783.64 --> 2787.9
it's getting less popular

2786.46 --> 2792.16
like

2787.9 --> 2796.359
their spell their weave of control in

2792.16 --> 2799.1189999999997
the new Society it's it's really working

2796.359 --> 2803.22
off like even the dumbest of the dumbest

2799.119 --> 2803.2200000000003
are just like not buying it anymore

2808.15 --> 2811.28
[Music]

2811.66 --> 2817.359
oh that dumb dumbass

2814.78 --> 2819.0400000000004
yeah that's the downside of unbanning

2817.359 --> 2823.359
all trolls I have to ban them all again

2819.04 --> 2825.819
because all these scumbags were banned

2823.359 --> 2829.56
not because they have philosophical

2825.819 --> 2833.94
differences but because they are overt

2829.56 --> 2837.88
scumbags that only seek to slander

2833.94 --> 2839.859
lie and disrupt

2837.88 --> 2844.319
and I'm gonna have to ban them all again

2839.859 --> 2844.319
and I have no problem with that though

2847.54 --> 2851.88
yeah even Dumb and Dumber are not

2849.22 --> 2854.859
falling pretty much well they are right

2851.88 --> 2856.839
but they think they're not the problem

2854.859 --> 2859.7799999999997
is is that the dumbest of people are

2856.839 --> 2863.319
like oh yo this is all fake but they'll

2859.78 --> 2865.78
still be pulled in when the time is

2863.319 --> 2869.02
there you see that's the problem because

2865.78 --> 2873.1800000000003
a lot of this agenda

2869.02 --> 2877.78
this new world order great reset

2873.18 --> 2883.18
it's not just like telling you it is

2877.78 --> 2886.96
also like they just enforce and lie and

2883.18 --> 2889.6189999999997
hypnotize people to do things it's all

2886.96 --> 2893.02
about manipulation so even if you know

2889.619 --> 2895.1800000000003
this is fake you might still be tricked

2893.02 --> 2898.3
into going along with it anyway

2895.18 --> 2900.64
at some point if you're very easily

2898.3 --> 2903.3390000000004
influenced

2900.64 --> 2906.52
and you don't have a

2903.339 --> 2909.22
a big critical thinking mind

2906.52 --> 2912.7599999999998
you're you can still be lured into it

2909.22 --> 2915.24
even as you know it's it's all lies

2912.76 --> 2915.2400000000002
right

2915.64 --> 2919.54
because there is like money getting

2917.619 --> 2921.6400000000003
thrown around not that that money is

2919.54 --> 2926.5
going to be worth anything

2921.64 --> 2928.0
but it is they still throw it around so

2926.5 --> 2932.079
but

2928.0 --> 2935.38
it's just not really working out anymore

2932.079 --> 2937.3
and there is like an apparatus of people

2935.38 --> 2941.2000000000003
that are high level

2937.3 --> 2944.8590000000004
like judicial lawyer people that are now

2941.2 --> 2947.5589999999997
really starting to form like anti-world

2944.859 --> 2949.9
economic forum

2947.559 --> 2952.9
like who used that used to be

2949.9 --> 2955.42
journalists right some of them now

2952.9 --> 2956.98
they're like

2955.42 --> 2958.7200000000003
more

2956.98 --> 2960.94
than just that

2958.72 --> 2962.74
so this is promising it's it might

2960.94 --> 2966.54
actually end

2962.74 --> 2966.54
it might actually end

2967.72 --> 2973.839
and I wonder how much of a dud it will

2970.599 --> 2976.42
be because there's almost a guarantee

2973.839 --> 2979.2999999999997
that those involved in this entire

2976.42 --> 2980.6800000000003
operation World economic Forum guide

2979.3 --> 2982.2400000000002
reset

2980.68 --> 2984.359
they're all

2982.24 --> 2988.5989999999997
like monstrous

2984.359 --> 2990.46
murdering anti-human criminals they are

2988.599 --> 2992.319
and they're probably not going to get

2990.46 --> 2995.619
the punishment that they that they

2992.319 --> 2997.66
really should be getting that's my

2995.619 --> 3000.059
yeah well I predicted that like even

2997.66 --> 3002.339
years ago or they're never they're

3000.059 --> 3005.88
probably gonna get away with it because

3002.339 --> 3009.0
everybody's just too wussied out like

3005.88 --> 3011.46
everybody is too afraid that if we oh if

3009.0 --> 3015.38
we get all brutal again or the death

3011.46 --> 3015.38
battles oh no

3017.339 --> 3021.619
everyone's a weak [ __ ] now

3022.26 --> 3030.2000000000003
that's why everybody's all weak

3026.059 --> 3035.579
fagoty oh no we're gonna be nice to The

3030.2 --> 3035.5789999999997
Psychotic anti-human murderers

3036.78 --> 3040.619
right

3038.099 --> 3042.599
everybody's too weak they think that if

3040.619 --> 3046.26
you actually get brutal

3042.599 --> 3048.42
in the face of that that you lose your

3046.26 --> 3051.42
immunity that way the enemies won

3048.42 --> 3056.52
because you know it yourself while they

3051.42 --> 3059.94
wreck the world around you you let them

3056.52 --> 3061.74
do it because you're [ __ ] weak you're

3059.94 --> 3065.52
just weak

3061.74 --> 3068.7599999999998
you're too weak to do that to make an

3065.52 --> 3071.7599999999998
actual sacrifice to go over that line

3068.76 --> 3076.1400000000003
and do something physical that will

3071.76 --> 3078.9
radically punish and alter what's out

3076.14 --> 3082.02
there spiritually in order for this [ __ ]

3078.9 --> 3085.319
Blossom this satanic [ __ ] Blossom to

3082.02 --> 3089.88
actually stop blossoming you have to get

3085.319 --> 3091.8
super brutal on them super brutal like

3089.88 --> 3094.859
heads rolling

3091.8 --> 3097.7400000000002
people burning alive

3094.859 --> 3100.319
and not innocent people that don't have

3097.74 --> 3102.8999999999996
anything to do with it which is what

3100.319 --> 3105.42
they cause oh well if we do that then we

3102.9 --> 3107.88
become yeah yeah they're doing it

3105.42 --> 3109.7400000000002
because you're not doing it

3107.88 --> 3111.839
you're not doing it to the people

3109.74 --> 3115.319
causing Acts

3111.839 --> 3119.72
you have to do that you have to finish

3115.319 --> 3124.74
them if you don't brutally murder

3119.72 --> 3127.319
satanic Lords then they win it's the

3124.74 --> 3129.66
only way to actually stop their momentum

3127.319 --> 3135.74
because they think they can get away

3129.66 --> 3135.74
with everything and they are

3141.87 --> 3145.29
[Music]

3148.2 --> 3152.9399999999996
you have to

3150.26 --> 3155.94
brutally punish them

3152.94 --> 3155.94
brutally

3156.18 --> 3161.7
and if you're too [ __ ] weak then turn

3159.18 --> 3164.22
off the television and ignore it like

3161.7 --> 3167.2799999999997
everything else like all the suffering

3164.22 --> 3169.5589999999997
and horror that those people have

3167.28 --> 3172.6800000000003
actually caused out there then you can

3169.559 --> 3176.1600000000003
ignore this as well when they get their

3172.68 --> 3177.0
due punishment brutally because they

3176.16 --> 3179.2799999999997
should

3177.0 --> 3182.52
there should be no reservation there

3179.28 --> 3185.52
should be no whining and whimpering

3182.52 --> 3187.859
about her Humanity dude you don't have

3185.52 --> 3190.819
[ __ ] Humanity anymore you're a slave

3187.859 --> 3194.819
you let berserking

3190.819 --> 3197.7599999999998
anti-human Satanist literally murder

3194.819 --> 3203.94
innocent people around you you let it

3197.76 --> 3203.94
happen you don't have any Humanity

3210.43 --> 3213.5099999999998
[Music]

3251.7 --> 3260.22
it's squirt for me funny [ __ ]

3256.319 --> 3264.319
yeah yeah so you let these Psychopaths

3260.22 --> 3267.98
take control and just start rolling out

3264.319 --> 3271.859
anti-human systems propaganda

3267.98 --> 3275.339
popularizing hatred against humans yeah

3271.859 --> 3278.22
you think you have [ __ ] Humanity you

3275.339 --> 3283.02
weak pathetic piece of [ __ ] you don't

3278.22 --> 3286.68
have Humanity you already lost it

3283.02 --> 3288.96
you lost it to these Monsters by not

3286.68 --> 3292.68
doing anything about it

3288.96 --> 3295.98
thinking it'll work itself out letting

3292.68 --> 3298.0789999999997
the atrocities be committed in your own

3295.98 --> 3300.599
freaking neighborhood and your countries

3298.079 --> 3303.7400000000002
and all that and you didn't do anything

3300.599 --> 3306.599
about it and you think that

3303.74 --> 3311.3999999999996
demanding that those people responsible

3306.599 --> 3314.4
be tried and executed publicly you think

3311.4 --> 3317.339
that is inhumane oh you're a piece of

3314.4 --> 3321.92
[ __ ] you should rot in hell

3317.339 --> 3321.92
you should literally rot in hell

3322.38 --> 3326.42
you don't get to say anything anymore

3327.0 --> 3332.579
the only way to end these [ __ ]

3329.64 --> 3335.64
scumbags and end this new world order

3332.579 --> 3338.04
garbage system that's been rolling out

3335.64 --> 3342.299
for over a hundred years the only way to

3338.04 --> 3346.92
stop them is to finish them off

3342.299 --> 3349.559
not politically not business blah blah

3346.92 --> 3352.859
no it's go there

3349.559 --> 3356.6400000000003
pull them out of their houses put them

3352.859 --> 3361.5
in the jail get them in a courthouse

3356.64 --> 3364.74
try them and then executing them

3361.5 --> 3367.619
and if that includes half the [ __ ]

3364.74 --> 3369.9599999999996
judicial system on top of that like the

3367.619 --> 3375.48
actual judges that kept all that [ __ ] in

3369.96 --> 3378.9
place as an uh among that then so be it

3375.48 --> 3383.42
Let Them Burn for what they allow to

3378.9 --> 3383.42
manifest let them burn in hell

3384.359 --> 3390.299
Heritage Lake Mirror or what that's like

3386.94 --> 3392.52
murder Dr arresting people putting them

3390.299 --> 3396.0
in jail trying them and then executing

3392.52 --> 3399.599
them for their for their crimes that's

3396.0 --> 3401.22
no that's actually Justice

3399.599 --> 3403.7400000000002
yeah

3401.22 --> 3406.14
you [ __ ] you didn't listen did you

3403.74 --> 3409.22
you [ __ ] Monk

3406.14 --> 3409.22
you didn't listen

3409.44 --> 3413.94
it's just when things get loud you

3412.2 --> 3416.0989999999997
suddenly become [ __ ] mentally

3413.94 --> 3419.099
deranged again you hear the words all

3416.099 --> 3421.5
wrong like a [ __ ] [ __ ] aren't you

3419.099 --> 3423.839
flatula huh

3421.5 --> 3427.579
[ __ ]

3423.839 --> 3427.5789999999997
get the [ __ ] out of my chat

3429.78 --> 3433.7000000000003
hey Godzilla welcome back

3435.96 --> 3439.28
apj CNET

3440.07 --> 3445.6800000000003
[Music]

3442.92 --> 3447.9
today because there is an old lady okay

3445.68 --> 3451.7
then Winfield you mean your mother is on

3447.9 --> 3451.7000000000003
is visiting or what

3470.28 --> 3476.76
what atrocities committed by who

3473.16 --> 3478.2
the entire medical emergency lockdown

3476.76 --> 3480.599
system

3478.2 --> 3483.48
the corporations

3480.599 --> 3486.78
basically forcing or yeah forcing people

3483.48 --> 3488.339
to get vaccinated or be fired the mask

3486.78 --> 3492.2400000000002
wearing

3488.339 --> 3494.4
all of it the entire system was a fraud

3492.24 --> 3497.7599999999998
from the start the proof that everything

3494.4 --> 3501.059
about it was a fraud was there readily

3497.76 --> 3504.1800000000003
available very quickly when it rolled

3501.059 --> 3507.7200000000003
out very quickly it was all there the

3504.18 --> 3510.96
proof of its entire fraud very clearly

3507.72 --> 3514.0989999999997
present right away

3510.96 --> 3518.46
and therefore everything that happened

3514.099 --> 3522.78
based on covet emergency lockdown policy

3518.46 --> 3525.78
is all crimes against humanity

3522.78 --> 3528.8590000000004
democide

3525.78 --> 3532.1400000000003
it is discriminate medical

3528.859 --> 3536.0989999999997
discrimination of unheard of proportions

3532.14 --> 3539.339
I mean this [ __ ] would have made the

3536.099 --> 3541.5
Nazis the actual Nazis from Germany in

3539.339 --> 3544.2599999999998
World War II blush

3541.5 --> 3547.5
over how brutal

3544.26 --> 3550.0400000000004
the Discrimination has been

3547.5 --> 3550.04
yeah

3550.26 --> 3554.0400000000004
another thing that really makes them

3552.0 --> 3556.14
Stand Out is that they actually would

3554.04 --> 3559.5
like execute people on the streets and

3556.14 --> 3560.7
[ __ ] witches like that is [ __ ] up

3559.5 --> 3563.16
right

3560.7 --> 3564.7799999999997
that is very [ __ ] up and that's not

3563.16 --> 3568.2
happening right now

3564.78 --> 3571.0400000000004
but all the other aspects are happening

3568.2 --> 3571.04
and worse

3580.94 --> 3587.2200000000003
minus the no Ben White there is no fake

3584.88 --> 3591.5
Alien Invasion nothing

3587.22 --> 3594.839
nothing there is none nothing nothing

3591.5 --> 3598.5
happens they don't need to do anything

3594.839 --> 3601.5589999999997
anymore they just yell at a freaking

3598.5 --> 3603.9
screen have a stupid little story some

3601.559 --> 3606.1800000000003
CGI and you'll believe it they don't

3603.9 --> 3610.079
need to do anything even

3606.18 --> 3612.9199999999996
they just produce Mass hysteria that's

3610.079 --> 3612.92
what they do now

3615.72 --> 3621.48
there isn't going to be a cohesive

3619.44 --> 3624.119
illusion

3621.48 --> 3627.559
none zero

3624.119 --> 3631.5
zero it's never gonna happen nothing

3627.559 --> 3635.579
it's literally your Escapist fantasy

3631.5 --> 3639.119
because you want out of this [ __ ]

3635.579 --> 3641.94
so you want that to happen so there is

3639.119 --> 3644.1600000000003
something else anything else but what

3641.94 --> 3646.799
we're going through right now guess what

3644.16 --> 3648.299
it's not going to happen that's not

3646.799 --> 3651.119
going to happen

3648.299 --> 3653.52
it is never going to happen what's going

3651.119 --> 3658.1400000000003
to happen is what is happening right now

3653.52 --> 3660.599
the situation we deal with right now

3658.14 --> 3663.0
that's what's happening and that is

3660.599 --> 3665.28
what's going to happen what is already

3663.0 --> 3667.98
happening right now there is not going

3665.28 --> 3671.579
to be some Fantastical new distraction

3667.98 --> 3674.64
that'll change everything all right no

3671.579 --> 3676.26
no it won't it's not gonna happen this

3674.64 --> 3678.24
is what they're doing this is what

3676.26 --> 3682.44
they're rolling out this is the

3678.24 --> 3685.22
challenge there will be no other

3682.44 --> 3685.2200000000003
you understand

3689.88 --> 3694.1400000000003
hope I'm right no I am right about this

3692.04 --> 3697.14
because they don't have anything

3694.14 --> 3699.54
it doesn't make any sense

3697.14 --> 3702.1189999999997
right

3699.54 --> 3704.7
like who's gonna do that nobody

3702.119 --> 3706.26
there's not there's not enough cohesion

3704.7 --> 3708.48
left

3706.26 --> 3711.96
in the power structure and in just

3708.48 --> 3715.04
everything to even do that

3711.96 --> 3715.04
there isn't anything

3715.98 --> 3718.98
foreign

3720.559 --> 3728.6600000000003
I mean at best there might be a hot War

3724.98 --> 3728.66
and like yeah

3729.119 --> 3734.76
places blowing up and weird foreign

3732.359 --> 3737.5789999999997
military rolling on streets all of a

3734.76 --> 3739.92
sudden right that might happen

3737.579 --> 3741.42
seems like a logical response for that

3739.92 --> 3744.0
to happen

3741.42 --> 3746.579
at some point especially because like

3744.0 --> 3749.88
even the whole Russia against

3746.579 --> 3752.1600000000003
America situation is is is like

3749.88 --> 3754.319
amplifying it's getting stronger they're

3752.16 --> 3756.1189999999997
more bold like it might actually be a

3754.319 --> 3759.119
hardware War there might be some

3756.119 --> 3762.059
missiles actually flying

3759.119 --> 3765.599
it's not gonna blow up entire countries

3762.059 --> 3769.26
that's a myth thank God but it will

3765.599 --> 3771.799
freaking blow up places for sure

3769.26 --> 3775.619
it's probably like gonna wipe out just

3771.799 --> 3777.839
giant swaths of military personnel

3775.619 --> 3781.28
that will probably happen they're

3777.839 --> 3781.2799999999997
probably all gonna get killed

3781.559 --> 3785.3390000000004
thank you

3782.88 --> 3787.619
I mean that's what I would do it's like

3785.339 --> 3789.72
oh nuke the entire country yeah or you

3787.619 --> 3792.059
literally just send message else to the

3789.72 --> 3795.6189999999997
bases where the military are and then

3792.059 --> 3795.619
specifically wipe them out

3796.319 --> 3799.7
and that's probably gonna happen

3816.02 --> 3822.0
the next fit no no Ben White

3819.839 --> 3823.619
golf

3822.0 --> 3826.26
dude

3823.619 --> 3827.94
they predicted TV in 2020 are you

3826.26 --> 3831.7200000000003
kidding me

3827.94 --> 3833.16
dude I got a guy telling me that in 2012

3831.72 --> 3836.7599999999998
okay

3833.16 --> 3840.359
in 2012 they told me

3836.76 --> 3843.7400000000002
that medical tyranny was coming like in

3840.359 --> 3845.7
10 years okay

3843.74 --> 3848.3999999999996
2012.

3845.7 --> 3851.339
it's not special all this shit's just

3848.4 --> 3854.2200000000003
been in papers it's literally in papers

3851.339 --> 3857.819
there is no paper for an alien invasion

3854.22 --> 3860.64
there is a paper for complete medical

3857.819 --> 3863.7
tyranny takeover of the entire world

3860.64 --> 3866.2799999999997
though with every detail every detail

3863.7 --> 3869.0389999999998
worked out that is there it has been

3866.28 --> 3872.76
there it's being used right now there is

3869.039 --> 3877.2000000000003
no graft for an alien invasion

3872.76 --> 3879.48
so they predict things that's cute yeah

3877.2 --> 3882.4199999999996
Alien Invasion I mean it's never been

3879.48 --> 3884.46
predicted before except for the last 50

3882.42 --> 3887.94
years every time

3884.46 --> 3890.48
yeah it's not gonna happen it's never

3887.94 --> 3890.48
gonna happen

3893.16 --> 3899.339
2017 yeah well my guy predicted it in

3896.88 --> 3901.799
2012.

3899.339 --> 3904.799
I don't even know if that's possible I

3901.799 --> 3907.319
don't know but I did freaking see it on

3904.799 --> 3909.35
the television

3907.319 --> 3910.859
Dark World

3909.35 --> 3914.1189999999997
[Music]

3910.859 --> 3914.119
it must have known

3914.88 --> 3920.819
probably less public but I mean like

3917.48 --> 3923.64
these these crones that are in the

3920.819 --> 3926.7599999999998
shadows making all this [ __ ] up

3923.64 --> 3930.66
they do it that's their life they've

3926.76 --> 3933.599
been working on this their entire life

3930.66 --> 3937.6189999999997
yeah riding up these plans and this

3933.599 --> 3939.9
paper they do that 50 years ahead of

3937.619 --> 3942.7200000000003
time and they make it their entire life

3939.9 --> 3944.52
making that plan

3942.72 --> 3949.799
yeah

3944.52 --> 3953.0389999999998
that's why this [ __ ] is known because it

3949.799 --> 3956.18
was already made like 50 years ago the

3953.039 --> 3956.1800000000003
entire [ __ ] thing

3956.76 --> 3961.98
it's just nobody knew about it then it

3960.119 --> 3964.319
was still kept secret now it's not a

3961.98 --> 3967.319
secret anymore it's out there it's

3964.319 --> 3971.359
already been in existence and being

3967.319 --> 3975.5589999999997
planned for a very long time

3971.359 --> 3975.5589999999997
very very long

3979.2 --> 3985.0789999999997
yeah fake Alien Invasion no that just

3983.4 --> 3987.78
doesn't work

3985.079 --> 3991.559
it doesn't work

3987.78 --> 3994.38
like a fake Alien Invasion only works

3991.559 --> 3996.3590000000004
when a world government is already in

3994.38 --> 3998.6400000000003
power

3996.359 --> 4000.5589999999997
and they're kind of losing grip and they

3998.64 --> 4003.14
need a fake opponent that's when a fake

4000.559 --> 4006.02
alien Innovation might happen we're not

4003.14 --> 4009.14
in that situation because the New World

4006.02 --> 4012.92
Order hasn't conquered us all we're in

4009.14 --> 4015.319
the middle of that fight if they win

4012.92 --> 4017.359
yeah fake alien Innovation might be

4015.319 --> 4020.72
there like as a distraction on the

4017.359 --> 4023.38
television you'll be too busy trying not

4020.72 --> 4023.3799999999997
to die

4023.839 --> 4030.92
and like not losing your mind

4027.38 --> 4033.1600000000003
to even care about it then you

4030.92 --> 4033.16
understand

4036.079 --> 4046.1600000000003
you will never ever have to worry about

4040.819 --> 4049.64
a fake Alien Invasion ever never ever by

4046.16 --> 4053.359
the time they Implement that your entire

4049.64 --> 4054.5
life is already so [ __ ] it won't even

4053.359 --> 4056.359
matter

4054.5 --> 4059.119
do you understand

4056.359 --> 4061.46
stop distracting yourself

4059.119 --> 4064.2200000000003
stop distracting yourself with [ __ ] that

4061.46 --> 4066.079
is completely unnecessary

4064.22 --> 4068.359
you don't have to worry about things

4066.079 --> 4071.48
that aren't going to happen worry about

4068.359 --> 4074.0589999999997
the things that are happening right now

4071.48 --> 4077.059
it's a much better way to spend your

4074.059 --> 4078.799
time getting nervous about something

4077.059 --> 4081.1600000000003
because at least the proof's already

4078.799 --> 4081.16
there

4087.319 --> 4093.859
we will eat the bugs we will own the

4090.68 --> 4096.5199999999995
nothing yeah

4093.859 --> 4096.5199999999995
foreign

4116.62 --> 4119.8589999999995
what the hell

4120.92 --> 4125.9
at least my chat got rolling now I guess

4123.319 --> 4128.0
I had to like pull in some new wool

4125.9 --> 4130.8189999999995
order [ __ ]

4128.0 --> 4133.94
I just don't typically like doing that I

4130.819 --> 4136.400000000001
don't want to really grab a hold of that

4133.94 --> 4139.099999999999
big picture anymore because it's such a

4136.4 --> 4143.199
freaking mess and it just makes me get

4139.1 --> 4143.1990000000005
all Final Solution Style

4163.159 --> 4168.08
nice swab impression that could be

4165.14 --> 4169.6990000000005
better but I mean the guy is a walking

4168.08 --> 4172.64
meme

4169.699 --> 4176.12
foreign to himself

4172.64 --> 4178.819
but yeah like he is memeable because

4176.12 --> 4181.2789999999995
that's his advertisement

4178.819 --> 4182.679
right you got to realize that these

4181.279 --> 4185.659000000001
modern

4182.679 --> 4188.12
globalists don't even care whether you

4185.659 --> 4190.639999999999
hate them love them

4188.12 --> 4193.94
or even respect them all they care about

4190.64 --> 4196.04
is that you never forget they exist

4193.94 --> 4198.919999999999
that's the only thing that's like their

4196.04 --> 4200.42
primary objective to be memorable they

4198.92 --> 4201.8
don't care if you think they're

4200.42 --> 4204.26
ridiculous

4201.8 --> 4208.6990000000005
if you can't stop thinking about them

4204.26 --> 4211.04
then they are happy they don't care how

4208.699 --> 4214.28
you understand that's how they operate

4211.04 --> 4218.12
now they just want to stick in your

4214.28 --> 4220.58
memory they don't care if you hate them

4218.12 --> 4223.239
they don't care they just want you to

4220.58 --> 4223.239
remember them

4224.96 --> 4229.58
they're up alert yeah you're way too

4227.54 --> 4232.1
late for that seeking star water

4229.58 --> 4234.86
I literally unblocked all the trolls

4232.1 --> 4237.9400000000005
like a half hour ago so

4234.86 --> 4237.94
hello by the way

4256.52 --> 4260.96
yeah well Ben White I know but yeah

4259.1 --> 4263.679
that's right you're addressing somebody

4260.96 --> 4263.679
else uh

4268.52 --> 4275.56
yeah look

4270.92 --> 4278.78
when Werner from Brown told that story

4275.56 --> 4281.42
very well known it's so well known like

4278.78 --> 4284.599999999999
literally every freaking person that

4281.42 --> 4286.34
isn't a mainstream purist numpty knows

4284.6 --> 4288.8
about it everybody knows about it

4286.34 --> 4292.219
everybody that watches Alex Jones or a

4288.8 --> 4297.08
Jason knows about it everybody yeah

4292.219 --> 4302.78
it's something that was the plan

4297.08 --> 4305.9
then 50 years ago that's the idea how

4302.78 --> 4309.08
they had drafted it so all he was doing

4305.9 --> 4312.44
when he was explaining that was the plan

4309.08 --> 4315.44
as they had constructed it that in a

4312.44 --> 4316.699
standardized way way back then well

4315.44 --> 4320.178999999999
guess what

4316.699 --> 4323.0
it's not that plan anymore that's the

4320.179 --> 4324.38
stuff they were working on between seven

4323.0 --> 4327.92
like 80

4324.38 --> 4330.8
and 50 years ago

4327.92 --> 4334.9400000000005
it's not relevant anymore it's what how

4330.8 --> 4337.52
it could have happened if that became

4334.94 --> 4340.339999999999
the plan it didn't

4337.52 --> 4342.9800000000005
it didn't become the plan

4340.34 --> 4346.04
the plan is different

4342.98 --> 4348.799999999999
a different plan has unrolled it's not

4346.04 --> 4353.26
gonna be that plan don't you get it

4348.8 --> 4353.26
who do you think are making these plans

4356.48 --> 4361.5199999999995
the plans that he was talking about were

4359.659 --> 4364.5199999999995
made by the same

4361.52 --> 4368.4800000000005
Farm it's like another arm of the same

4364.52 --> 4370.46
group of conspirators and the co-monster

4368.48 --> 4372.919999999999
that is doing what they're doing right

4370.46 --> 4374.8
now with the world economic Forum it's

4372.92 --> 4379.6990000000005
those groups that thought that up

4374.8 --> 4382.1
between 80 and 50 years ago it was a

4379.699 --> 4383.78
direction that they developed like we

4382.1 --> 4386.4400000000005
could do it like this

4383.78 --> 4390.739
they didn't choose to do it like that

4386.44 --> 4393.919999999999
they chose another route you see

4390.739 --> 4397.299999999999
you can't match that

4393.92 --> 4397.3
doesn't work like that

4400.74 --> 4403.8589999999995
[Music]

4422.8 --> 4427.159000000001
they don't need any more power and

4425.3 --> 4429.26
control

4427.159 --> 4431.12
and besides the people are not going to

4429.26 --> 4433.34
give it to them they'd rather see

4431.12 --> 4436.4
everything destroyed by aliens than at

4433.34 --> 4438.38
this point give this [ __ ] piece of

4436.4 --> 4442.299999999999
[ __ ] type of government any power

4438.38 --> 4442.3
whatsoever any power

4443.84 --> 4448.64
like after everything they've done right

4445.76 --> 4451.58
now you think that anybody's gonna trust

4448.64 --> 4455.42
any kind of reporting

4451.58 --> 4458.96
to really now with everything people

4455.42 --> 4462.4400000000005
will want to actually give power to a

4458.96 --> 4465.9800000000005
government because of any situation I

4462.44 --> 4469.0599999999995
don't think so it's too late nobody

4465.98 --> 4473.48
trusts the government anymore the open

4469.06 --> 4477.5
neo-fugalist scheme has been exposed

4473.48 --> 4481.159
people know now that their rulers are at

4477.5 --> 4483.26
war with them they know now it won't

4481.159 --> 4486.5
work anymore

4483.26 --> 4490.04
people are not gonna vote their power to

4486.5 --> 4493.88
a government over a fake Alien Invasion

4490.04 --> 4496.42
when they know their government can't be

4493.88 --> 4499.64
trusted anymore even with the numpties

4496.42 --> 4502.9400000000005
it doesn't work anymore

4499.64 --> 4507.1990000000005
this scheme has been exposed

4502.94 --> 4510.82
the setup won't function then

4507.199 --> 4510.82
think logically

4519.24 --> 4525.4

4544.28 --> 4549.98
thanks for everything I do okay well

4546.56 --> 4552.64
glad you're amused rubber digital

4549.98 --> 4552.639999999999
break

4569.9 --> 4573.28
it's not funny Dan

4573.5 --> 4578.6
we're talking about serious [ __ ] not

4575.78 --> 4581.0599999999995
your Reflections upon cartoons involving

4578.6 --> 4583.780000000001

[Music]

4615.14 --> 4621.38
that's right seeking style water it's a

4618.02 --> 4621.38
good one universal

4623.38 --> 4628.76
so yeah there's not gonna be a fake

4626.0 --> 4633.1
Alien Invasion it's never gonna happen

4628.76 --> 4633.1
not within our lifetimes anyway

4634.28 --> 4639.5
I mean things can still go sour guys

4636.86 --> 4642.0199999999995
like even after

4639.5 --> 4644.3
this medical tyranny [ __ ] is over and

4642.02 --> 4645.320000000001
we're very likely to actually win this

4644.3 --> 4647.84
one

4645.32 --> 4650.179
we can win

4647.84 --> 4652.04
it's got to be with scars though because

4650.179 --> 4654.8
they're still just carving up the world

4652.04 --> 4657.0199999999995
they have already murdered millions and

4654.8 --> 4658.9400000000005
millions of people they've already done

4657.02 --> 4661.280000000001
it through their policies

4658.94 --> 4663.5
you can't undo that they're not going to

4661.28 --> 4666.199
come back just because they're defeated

4663.5 --> 4668.6
right but yeah what's going to happen

4666.199 --> 4671.12
with the new world

4668.6 --> 4673.76
how is it gonna form

4671.12 --> 4675.38
there will be power struggles if there's

4673.76 --> 4677.900000000001
going to be power struggles of who's

4675.38 --> 4681.02
going to be on top of this more justice

4677.9 --> 4684.379999999999
justice oriented

4681.02 --> 4688.46
human oriented like basically more

4684.38 --> 4690.8
biblical the non-gay New World Order

4688.46 --> 4693.56
or the global homo as some people call

4690.8 --> 4696.92
it right that's defeated and the New

4693.56 --> 4700.46
World Order will arrive like you can't

4696.92 --> 4703.46
it has to Mana it can't not manifest it

4700.46 --> 4706.699
it cannot be prevented guys

4703.46 --> 4708.56
is just gonna happen one way or the

4706.699 --> 4712.04
other it's gonna happen

4708.56 --> 4714.5
so what are we gonna have

4712.04 --> 4716.659
that's the question

4714.5 --> 4718.46
what is it gonna be

4716.659 --> 4721.659
is it going to be like a slightly

4718.46 --> 4721.659
Christian oriented

4722.48 --> 4727.28
yeah more Justice oriented

4725.84 --> 4729.92
World Order

4727.28 --> 4732.259999999999
is it going to be unipolar multi-polar

4729.92 --> 4734.3
how is it gonna work right because as

4732.26 --> 4736.1
soon as power struggles within that

4734.3 --> 4738.860000000001
start to form

4736.1 --> 4741.92
that's when an alien invasion could

4738.86 --> 4744.44
actually start to roll out and then

4741.92 --> 4747.14
nobody would expect it right because it

4744.44 --> 4749.419999999999
only works when nobody expects it that's

4747.14 --> 4751.58
the point if everybody's already like

4749.42 --> 4753.92
knowing like this government is evil

4751.58 --> 4756.739
they're lying about everything yeah an

4753.92 --> 4759.08
alien invasion nobody's gonna buy it it

4756.739 --> 4762.5599999999995
makes no sense they're only gonna buy it

4759.08 --> 4764.12
if they don't expect that if they do

4762.56 --> 4767.120000000001
actually kind of trust the government

4764.12 --> 4770.54
again that could happen first This

4767.12 --> 4771.739
Global homo government has to be utterly

4770.54 --> 4774.8
defeated

4771.739 --> 4776.36
and put the trial and like so that

4774.8 --> 4779.54
everybody in the world has an insurance

4776.36 --> 4782.0599999999995
these [ __ ] freaks are never gonna be

4779.54 --> 4783.98
in control again like this

4782.06 --> 4787.52
and only then

4783.98 --> 4790.5199999999995
could potentially at some point

4787.52 --> 4792.7390000000005
an alien invasion false flag be used by

4790.52 --> 4795.5
some power faction

4792.739 --> 4798.139999999999
to gain momentum only then could

4795.5 --> 4803.0
something like that work only then right

4798.14 --> 4808.4800000000005
now it cannot happen it cannot happen it

4803.0 --> 4808.48
can not happen makes no sense

4810.06 --> 4813.119000000001
[Music]

4813.38 --> 4819.679
no Ben White no they won't

4817.52 --> 4821.42
stop being a boomer and listen to what

4819.679 --> 4824.3
I'm [ __ ] saying

4821.42 --> 4826.88
you're talking about Mass mind control

4824.3 --> 4829.1
operations they have very specific

4826.88 --> 4830.42
parameters I know what the [ __ ] I'm

4829.1 --> 4833.96
talking about

4830.42 --> 4835.159
stop saying oh it'll happen anyway no it

4833.96 --> 4838.94
won't

4835.159 --> 4842.48
it won't happen don't you get it

4838.94 --> 4847.219
it can't happen it won't be functional

4842.48 --> 4850.339999999999
like the entire use of it will be wasted

4847.219 --> 4854.0
it has no point of being used right now

4850.34 --> 4856.400000000001
stop it stop blabbering the same [ __ ]

4854.0 --> 4859.219
over and over again Ben White it's not

4856.4 --> 4863.799999999999
gonna happen it can't happen has no

4859.219 --> 4863.8
reason to happen it could never function

4865.35 --> 4869.869000000001
[Music]

4870.1 --> 4875.4800000000005
besides I'm pretty damn well sure damn

4874.159 --> 4877.219
well sure

4875.48 --> 4879.678999999999
yeah

4877.219 --> 4882.92
that the uh

4879.679 --> 4886.34
Werner from Brown and he did not take

4882.92 --> 4889.34
into account a flat Earth Awakening on

4886.34 --> 4891.9800000000005
the internet all right

4889.34 --> 4896.56
he definitely did not take that into

4891.98 --> 4896.5599999999995
account that that was going to happen

4899.42 --> 4905.719
right if he would then he would have

4902.84 --> 4908.719
mentioned something about that something

4905.719 --> 4911.2390000000005
it would have hidden it not called it

4908.719 --> 4915.8
literally the Flat Earth or something he

4911.239 --> 4917.718999999999
would have appointed in it as a factor

4915.8 --> 4920.12
of something that's playing parallel

4917.719 --> 4923.12
because it's right here right now

4920.12 --> 4927.739
he hasn't he hasn't predicted it because

4923.12 --> 4931.0599999999995
it wasn't part of that Clan you see

4927.739 --> 4931.0599999999995
it makes no sense

4939.56 --> 4944.3
his tombstone

4941.96 --> 4948.199
yeah I'm not talking about him not

4944.3 --> 4951.7390000000005
knowing the Earth is flat yes he knew it

4948.199 --> 4954.138999999999
he did not take into account a flat

4951.739 --> 4957.259999999999
Earth Awakening

4954.139 --> 4958.46
on the internet that would have been

4957.26 --> 4962.06
there

4958.46 --> 4964.76
like 50 years later he did not take that

4962.06 --> 4967.219
into account you have to admit that

4964.76 --> 4970.159000000001
doesn't matter that he knew it was there

4967.219 --> 4973.159
he didn't take into account for the

4970.159 --> 4976.04
Alien Invasion plan that there would be

4973.159 --> 4978.44
a flat Earth Awakening there is a flat

4976.04 --> 4981.08
Earth Awakening it can't happen anymore

4978.44 --> 4984.678999999999
not like this

4981.08 --> 4987.5599999999995
not like this at all

4984.679 --> 4990.56
I mean it might have had been possible

4987.56 --> 4993.080000000001
say 20 years ago

4990.56 --> 4996.56
30 years ago

4993.08 --> 5000.159
but they didn't do it and now the time

4996.56 --> 5001.900000000001
of opportunity to engage that has fast

5000.159 --> 5005.759999999999
it's over

5001.9 --> 5005.759999999999
you understand it's over

5006.159 --> 5010.138999999999
it's not going to happen

5018.699 --> 5023.5
and I'm getting kind of tired of trying

5020.98 --> 5026.5
to make this very cohesive well thought

5023.5 --> 5030.04
out true point because I'm right about

5026.5 --> 5033.52
this you can all write that down in your

5030.04 --> 5035.5
journal in 10 years or 20 years when it

5033.52 --> 5037.540000000001
turns out that I was right and that I

5035.5 --> 5041.82
know exactly what I'm saying right here

5037.54 --> 5041.82
and that I'm correct because I am

5044.199 --> 5046.919999999999
foreign

5051.46 --> 5056.9800000000005
he did not indeed then Winfield he did

5054.219 --> 5058.96
not anticipate a flat Earth Awakening he

5056.98 --> 5060.459999999999
knew that people would be flat earthers

5058.96 --> 5062.92
out there because they even were then

5060.46 --> 5064.659
like during hippie age and 70s and all

5062.92 --> 5066.52
yeah they were already there

5064.659 --> 5068.44
but it's not he did not take into

5066.52 --> 5071.56
account that it would spread on the

5068.44 --> 5075.159
internet as it has if he had then he

5071.56 --> 5077.92
would have realized how much impact

5075.159 --> 5080.199
that would have made he would have taken

5077.92 --> 5082.84
that into account on his long-term

5080.199 --> 5086.159
planning of that list he didn't because

5082.84 --> 5086.159000000001
he didn't see it coming

5086.32 --> 5093.04
plan is over it's over

5089.5 --> 5095.46
it can't be done anymore now it won't

5093.04 --> 5095.46
work

5098.02 --> 5104.139
no no steamy traveler Fe is never going

5101.92 --> 5108.06
to be mainstream and in control ever

5104.139 --> 5108.06
it's never going to be that

5108.4 --> 5115.0599999999995
but the strictness of globe teaching

5111.96 --> 5117.4
will be reduced

5115.06 --> 5119.1990000000005
they have to

5117.4 --> 5120.4
because they'll lose the authority if

5119.199 --> 5122.5599999999995
they don't

5120.4 --> 5125.0199999999995
but is you're always going to be

5122.56 --> 5129.54
freaking seeing Globes

5125.02 --> 5133.540000000001
on television screams and in news shows

5129.54 --> 5137.679
you're always going to be seeing Globes

5133.54 --> 5139.54
on screens till the day you die you

5137.679 --> 5141.28
understand it's never going to go away

5139.54 --> 5143.26
ever

5141.28 --> 5144.82
ever

5143.26 --> 5150.159000000001
but

5144.82 --> 5153.34
it will be understood widely to be what

5150.159 --> 5158.199
it really is a fictional medium that we

5153.34 --> 5161.219
all share that is used to tell the story

5158.199 --> 5161.219
in ways

5161.739 --> 5167.379999999999
and people will know the Earth is flat

5164.92 --> 5170.86
and they're probably in school will even

5167.38 --> 5172.36
be at some point open debates as I have

5170.86 --> 5174.5199999999995
hoped it would

5172.36 --> 5177.159
where literally it would be part of the

5174.52 --> 5180.820000000001
school that you argue Flat Earth against

5177.159 --> 5182.799999999999
globe and actually have an honest debate

5180.82 --> 5184.48
to train

5182.8 --> 5186.34
it's training for kids intellectual

5184.48 --> 5187.9
training and debate training all that

5186.34 --> 5189.82
right kind of like what we're doing at

5187.9 --> 5192.5199999999995
the Flat Earth debates it's very

5189.82 --> 5196.96
suitable and repeatable

5192.52 --> 5199.780000000001
I think it will come eventually

5196.96 --> 5202.7390000000005
but you will always see Globes on

5199.78 --> 5202.739
television screens

5205.0 --> 5210.1
it's just always going to be there

5207.34 --> 5212.860000000001
there's not there's too much investment

5210.1 --> 5216.76
in it there's like

5212.86 --> 5220.839999999999
just huge huge stacks of money

5216.76 --> 5223.96
invested specifically on the globe why

5220.84 --> 5227.56
because of its predictable nature and

5223.96 --> 5230.32
like control that you can you get with

5227.56 --> 5232.54
it it's not going to be relinquished

5230.32 --> 5234.46
they're not going to stop doing that

5232.54 --> 5237.58
just because they're called out as like

5234.46 --> 5239.86
this is fake they don't give a [ __ ] the

5237.58 --> 5241.659
globe is fake they don't care

5239.86 --> 5244.839999999999
they don't care

5241.659 --> 5247.839999999999
doesn't matter to them it's fake they

5244.84 --> 5250.6
don't care they don't care they're gonna

5247.84 --> 5253.139
do it and you're gonna have to learn to

5250.6 --> 5253.139
deal with it

5267.639 --> 5273.78
UFO narrative yes of course but pjc Ned

5270.46 --> 5273.78
look UFO narratives

5274.12 --> 5280.5599999999995
yeah

5276.4 --> 5284.32
but I'm pretty fairly certain that UFO

5280.56 --> 5287.5
phenomena out there are just man-made

5284.32 --> 5288.759999999999
technology it's stuff stuff that's

5287.5 --> 5291.94
happening

5288.76 --> 5294.219
and they're like using it to kind of be

5291.94 --> 5296.98
like oh aliens

5294.219 --> 5299.08
who gives a [ __ ]

5296.98 --> 5302.44
there is no aliens there's no outer

5299.08 --> 5303.88
space there's no actual alien alive

5302.44 --> 5306.5199999999995
anywhere

5303.88 --> 5310.0
and even if there would be at some point

5306.52 --> 5311.679
it would be very easy to figure out what

5310.0 --> 5314.199
they are and that they're probably like

5311.679 --> 5317.4400000000005
man-made mutants

5314.199 --> 5321.28
I mean the ability to like genetically

5317.44 --> 5323.919999999999
modify is not just oh we can make

5321.28 --> 5327.58
freakishly things like we can make

5323.92 --> 5329.28
freakish creatures no it is also the

5327.58 --> 5331.78
knowledge of

5329.28 --> 5333.4
determining if it is genetically

5331.78 --> 5335.92
modified and how what's the original

5333.4 --> 5338.94
Source etc etc all that knowledge is

5335.92 --> 5338.9400000000005
gonna be right there

5339.76 --> 5343.6
it's just like hey oh you're an alien

5342.82 --> 5347.98
right

5343.6 --> 5349.780000000001
click thank you for that skin cell I'm

5347.98 --> 5353.08
going to determine now where you come

5349.78 --> 5355.239
from and how you were made

5353.08 --> 5358.78
and like you don't even need like a

5355.239 --> 5362.32
super billionaire laboratory to do that

5358.78 --> 5364.62
at that point right it's complete waste

5362.32 --> 5364.62
of time

5364.96 --> 5369.34
it doesn't matter anymore it's not gonna

5367.84 --> 5372.88
work

5369.34 --> 5375.179
it won't work nothing about it can work

5372.88 --> 5375.179
now

5376.96 --> 5381.46
right all they can do is just have a

5379.6 --> 5384.400000000001
looming suggestion of that there might

5381.46 --> 5386.7390000000005
be some alien power out there to kind of

5384.4 --> 5391.0
like be like oh we need better military

5386.739 --> 5393.459999999999
forces so we need more upgraded Jets and

5391.0 --> 5395.739
all that right because the aliens might

5393.46 --> 5398.08
be strong that's like the only little

5395.739 --> 5400.678999999999
Trixie that they can still do with it

5398.08 --> 5402.639
right it's just like oh

5400.679 --> 5404.679
military-industrial complex need more

5402.639 --> 5407.08
investment because they need to develop

5404.679 --> 5410.38
technology to be able to

5407.08 --> 5412.6
keep track of the UFOs so that if they

5410.38 --> 5414.46
turn out to be hostile that we will be

5412.6 --> 5417.04
able to face them right that's what they

5414.46 --> 5418.2390000000005
do that's the most they would ever do

5417.04 --> 5420.88
with it

5418.239 --> 5424.98
they're not gonna like to an alien

5420.88 --> 5424.9800000000005
invasion it's total useless

5425.32 --> 5433.239
they don't need to do that all they need

5429.1 --> 5434.4400000000005
is to have a little hooksy Hoxie for

5433.239 --> 5438.159
your mind

5434.44 --> 5441.759999999999
and make you fascinated with aliens in

5438.159 --> 5444.759999999999
your fantasy when they tell you oh the

5441.76 --> 5447.46
military needs better equipment that's

5444.76 --> 5448.780000000001
all they need they don't need anything

5447.46 --> 5452.62
else

5448.78 --> 5455.139
just think about it just think please

5452.62 --> 5458.639
just think

5455.139 --> 5461.8
stop blabbering stop echoing stop

5458.639 --> 5464.5
laying oh I I heard this word watch I'm

5461.8 --> 5469.860000000001
gonna say these were actually put them

5464.5 --> 5469.86
in a cohesive order think about it

5470.139 --> 5472.9800000000005
please

5482.98 --> 5487.239
thought I heard or Wednesday there was a

5485.199 --> 5489.419999999999
fe push in a hippie movement yeah there

5487.239 --> 5489.419999999999
was

5491.199 --> 5497.919999999999
I mean it's not like the Fe movement as

5494.92 --> 5498.88
we know it now but it was widely drawn

5497.92 --> 5502.92
in

5498.88 --> 5502.92
like my parents were dealing with that

5508.78 --> 5512.199
right

5510.04 --> 5515.98
the hippie movement of course there's

5512.199 --> 5518.5599999999995
two factors to it when that all happened

5515.98 --> 5520.839999999999
above the ground and the underground the

5518.56 --> 5523.96
underground was dealing like people

5520.84 --> 5525.46
fascinated with the occult

5523.96 --> 5528.639
with

5525.46 --> 5530.9800000000005
other religions and figuring out secret

5528.639 --> 5533.9800000000005
lore like that the Earth is actually

5530.98 --> 5536.44
flat and the space stuff and everything

5533.98 --> 5539.5599999999995
science fiction and

5536.44 --> 5540.5199999999995
the societies that preceded all that

5539.56 --> 5543.04
right

5540.52 --> 5547.120000000001
that's the underground the above ground

5543.04 --> 5550.42
is beetles using drugs or making sex

5547.12 --> 5553.12
normal and all free love and just act

5550.42 --> 5555.159
like a [ __ ] that's the above ground

5553.12 --> 5560.08
hippie [ __ ]

5555.159 --> 5562.179
right Tavistock influence all the LSD

5560.08 --> 5564.76
right

5562.179 --> 5566.679
it's the top side hippie movement and

5564.76 --> 5569.7390000000005
then there's the Downs like the secret

5566.679 --> 5571.84
hit b side that wasn't everywhere in the

5569.739 --> 5574.299999999999
media because those people actually

5571.84 --> 5576.28
figured out really complicated [ __ ] and

5574.3 --> 5578.62
are called [ __ ] that the media didn't

5576.28 --> 5579.94
want anything anybody out there to know

5578.62 --> 5581.139
about

5579.94 --> 5583.0
yeah

5581.139 --> 5586.06
it was there

5583.0 --> 5587.56
hippies in the 70s

5586.06 --> 5589.6
like

5587.56 --> 5592.179
the more serious one like the more

5589.6 --> 5594.52
witchy type shamanic they did know the

5592.179 --> 5596.8
Earth was flat and they did know it's

5594.52 --> 5598.6
very dangerous it back then it was

5596.8 --> 5599.7390000000005
really dangerous to talk about that

5598.6 --> 5601.659000000001
openly

5599.739 --> 5604.0
right you might be put in a mental

5601.659 --> 5606.58
institution they they would do that [ __ ]

5604.0 --> 5610.62
now they don't do that [ __ ]

5606.58 --> 5610.62
now you can actually talk about it

5611.56 --> 5614.820000000001
and that's the big difference

5617.219 --> 5621.2390000000005
yeah no [ __ ] Sherlock

5635.56 --> 5640.1990000000005
there is nothing outside the container

5637.719 --> 5644.02
there's no proof there is anything

5640.199 --> 5645.879999999999
outside of the contained realm and the

5644.02 --> 5651.06
woods no proof

5645.88 --> 5651.06
no proof no hint nothing not even a clue

5652.719 --> 5657.639
this rumor about Waters being out

5655.719 --> 5660.699
outside of there

5657.639 --> 5663.04
it literally has no viable Roots you

5660.699 --> 5664.36
know where that is that assumption came

5663.04 --> 5667.659
from

5664.36 --> 5670.0599999999995
the only place it came from of water

5667.659 --> 5671.799999999999
supposedly being up there

5670.06 --> 5673.360000000001
on the other side of the Dome you know

5671.8 --> 5675.52
where that comes from

5673.36 --> 5679.12
it's only one

5675.52 --> 5682.780000000001
one little sentence in the Bible

5679.12 --> 5686.34
right got her God divided the waters

5682.78 --> 5689.34
from the waters that's the only sentence

5686.34 --> 5692.38
that even remotely

5689.34 --> 5696.04
originated that suggestion it's the only

5692.38 --> 5699.900000000001
sentence only one sentence

5696.04 --> 5699.9
you understand that's it

5701.199 --> 5706.419999999999
there is absolutely no other

5704.98 --> 5709.959999999999
hints

5706.42 --> 5712.42
at that there even is any volume outside

5709.96 --> 5716.34
of our contained space

5712.42 --> 5716.34
that is filled up with anything

5718.179 --> 5723.6
no Andy Woods don't be a dumbass

5725.139 --> 5728.139
seriously

5736.92 --> 5740.26
[Music]

5744.52 --> 5748.93
foreign

5745.69 --> 5748.929999999999
[Music]

5753.699 --> 5757.86
not in its gaseous state it doesn't

5758.08 --> 5764.08
besides mass is not really a thing it is

5761.619 --> 5767.099999999999
only a derived concept

5764.08 --> 5767.1
from density

5767.32 --> 5775.38
and then yeah you get a problem with gas

5770.56 --> 5775.38
because no gas does not have mass

5777.58 --> 5783.6
it's a derived concept it's basically

5780.48 --> 5786.159
derived from relative density

5783.6 --> 5788.5
standardized weight it's really the

5786.159 --> 5792.28
weight the it's all about the weight

5788.5 --> 5795.699
which basically is complicated situation

5792.28 --> 5797.92
with gravity presuppose and all that

5795.699 --> 5800.619
it's just pressure

5797.92 --> 5803.38
that's the weight and the Mass is like

5800.619 --> 5807.099999999999
the derivative that comes out of that

5803.38 --> 5809.619
the factor that is assigned to material

5807.1 --> 5812.5
this isn't actually a thing

5809.619 --> 5815.799999999999
mass is not a thing

5812.5 --> 5817.96
it's just a derived concept based on

5815.8 --> 5820.0
conventions that have presuppositions

5817.96 --> 5823.179
within them

5820.0 --> 5827.04
so no gas does not have mass it may have

5823.179 --> 5827.04
been assigned atomic mass

5827.139 --> 5834.1
but a gas does not have mass in its

5831.46 --> 5836.44
gaseous state

5834.1 --> 5839.08
it just doesn't

5836.44 --> 5842.678999999999
it's never even measured

5839.08 --> 5846.28
you can't measure gas you can't measure

5842.679 --> 5848.8
its weight right when you measure gas

5846.28 --> 5851.32
weight it's going to be in some kind of

5848.8 --> 5853.84
a container it's going to be compressed

5851.32 --> 5858.04
and it's not going to be in its natural

5853.84 --> 5860.139
expanded state which is how gas is

5858.04 --> 5863.5
right it's probably going to be liquid

5860.139 --> 5866.02
or solidified or like this weird freaky

5863.5 --> 5868.48
super fluid whatever

5866.02 --> 5872.1990000000005
yeah and then oh yeah it's compacted oh

5868.48 --> 5876.339999999999
now shall lead gets weight yeah but in

5872.199 --> 5879.82
its standard expanded State gas doesn't

5876.34 --> 5882.34
have mass it doesn't

5879.82 --> 5885.54
you can't weigh it

5882.34 --> 5885.54
it's impossible

5890.92 --> 5897.0
now there is no Citation for that I

5893.56 --> 5897.0
literally explained it

5897.28 --> 5904.32
I am the citation I explained it to you

5901.48 --> 5904.32
every step

5907.91 --> 5916.42
[Music]

5913.84 --> 5917.8
why does my propane tank weigh more when

5916.42 --> 5921.34
full of gas

5917.8 --> 5925.06
because it's full of liquid numpty

5921.34 --> 5926.9800000000005
[ __ ] it's full of liquid that's why

5925.06 --> 5930.9400000000005
it weighs something

5926.98 --> 5934.599999999999
when it's not full of gas it's empty

5930.94 --> 5936.46
guess what they're still gas in it yeah

5934.6 --> 5939.34
it's just not

5936.46 --> 5941.9800000000005
got away anything because gas has no

5939.34 --> 5945.159000000001
Mass you can't distinguish it the tanker

5941.98 --> 5947.86
is gonna outweigh everything that is

5945.159 --> 5950.86
supposedly in there by such a long shot

5947.86 --> 5954.219
you literally weigh nothing because gas

5950.86 --> 5955.48
doesn't have mass you have to compress

5954.219 --> 5957.88
it

5955.48 --> 5960.699
so that it turns into a liquid or some

5957.88 --> 5962.619
kind of a superfluid or a solid some

5960.699 --> 5965.5599999999995
gases right

5962.619 --> 5968.199
you have to compress them then it might

5965.56 --> 5971.139
attain weight because a liquid and a

5968.199 --> 5972.839999999999
solid have mass

5971.139 --> 5976.5
they do

5972.84 --> 5976.5
gases don't

5983.139 --> 5990.58
yeah but hey the weight of a container

5986.5 --> 5993.159
yeah if there's just gas openly expanded

5990.58 --> 5996.4
in a normal pressure situation like

5993.159 --> 5999.159
equalized tube like the outside world

5996.4 --> 6003.08
it's not gonna weigh anything it's

5999.159 --> 6006.96
literally the same density

6003.08 --> 6009.96
as the air surrounding it

6006.96 --> 6012.719
so it's not gonna give any relative

6009.96 --> 6016.02
density this equilibrium force in order

6012.719 --> 6019.02
to establish weight that's why gas

6016.02 --> 6021.96
doesn't have mass

6019.02 --> 6025.8
you have to like unnaturally compact it

6021.96 --> 6027.4800000000005
or turn it into a non-gas to for it to

6025.8 --> 6030.54
gain Mass

6027.48 --> 6034.5599999999995
so that you can weigh it because in its

6030.54 --> 6036.86
normal expanded state it will not have

6034.56 --> 6036.860000000001
that

6040.38 --> 6046.7390000000005
masses and wait we're using two yeah

6043.98 --> 6051.259999999999
right mass is the thing

6046.739 --> 6051.259999999999
that you derive from weight

6051.719 --> 6057.06
weight is relative density this

6054.239 --> 6059.159
equilibrium force in a

6057.06 --> 6063.5
medium

6059.159 --> 6063.5
of standard gas at ground level

6063.54 --> 6071.36
right so it's one

6066.5 --> 6071.36
convention based on another convention

6073.32 --> 6077.46
right it's not the same thing but

6075.36 --> 6080.339999999999
they're internally linked

6077.46 --> 6083.34
mass is derived from weight

6080.34 --> 6085.56
weight is a convention based on relative

6083.34 --> 6089.4800000000005
density this equilibrium and standard

6085.56 --> 6089.4800000000005
gas at ground level

6094.02 --> 6097.9800000000005
you mean that when gas is compressed it

6096.54 --> 6103.56
creates Mass

6097.98 --> 6104.94
creates Mass it attains Mass it becomes

6103.56 --> 6109.139
well

6104.94 --> 6110.879999999999
dense enough to cause a disequilibrium

6109.139 --> 6114.7390000000005
with the surrounding

6110.88 --> 6114.7390000000005
and then it will attain Mass

6119.639 --> 6123.900000000001
thank you stopping traffic I'm gonna

6121.139 --> 6126.42
rest out for the support there

6123.9 --> 6128.28
verbal support I appreciate it good to

6126.42 --> 6130.679
see you here

6128.28 --> 6134.82
all right so I'm gonna run out this show

6130.679 --> 6137.159
I'm glad it kind of rolled

6134.82 --> 6141.0599999999995
first half was really [ __ ] annoying

6137.159 --> 6143.219
with people just not saying [ __ ]

6141.06 --> 6145.9400000000005
fortunately the second half was a lot

6143.219 --> 6145.94
more interesting

6146.58 --> 6153.84
so yeah I hope you guys liked it as well

6151.44 --> 6155.879999999999
so thanks everyone for coming

6153.84 --> 6158.1

6173.04 --> 6176.639
membership assistant join button they'll

6175.08 --> 6179.639
be much appreciated

6176.639 --> 6181.82
can always use it please do keep it

6179.639 --> 6181.82
coming

6183.84 --> 6189.42
oh yeah pgcina don't worry about it

6186.659 --> 6190.679
I mean at least you're always giving

6189.42 --> 6193.7390000000005
good input

6190.679 --> 6197.219
right so I'll be back tomorrow with flat

6193.739 --> 6199.98
Earth early bird number 1262.

6197.219 --> 6201.36
should be on a Friday

6199.98 --> 6203.5199999999995
and I'm gonna join the Flat Earth

6201.36 --> 6205.86
debates which should start up any minute

6203.52 --> 6208.4400000000005
now over at Nathan Oakley 9080 Channel

6205.86 --> 6213.259999999999
hope to see you there in chat and until

6208.44 --> 6213.259999999999
the next video keep it flat

6214.139 --> 6245.399
foreign

6215.52 --> 6245.399
