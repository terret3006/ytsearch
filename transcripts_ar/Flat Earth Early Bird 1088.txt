pick up the Halo of light

98.52 --> 106.52
behind me because it's suddenly a really

102.24 --> 106.52
beautiful sunny Bright Day

106.619 --> 111.079
a couple of hazy looking clouds in the

108.899 --> 114.2
distance but the sun is coming through

111.079 --> 114.19999999999999
all right

117.2 --> 121.34
and it's kind of wind still

121.38 --> 129.079
so it's just really beautiful out there

125.939 --> 129.07899999999998
at least for now

132.239 --> 137.18
I think that started last night when it

134.34 --> 137.18
just cleared up

151.98 --> 157.61999999999998
right

153.78 --> 163.86
nobody's in chat just yet all right

157.62 --> 163.86
it is Thursday the 2nd of September 2021

170.64 --> 175.55999999999997
hmm

172.56 --> 178.019
that's odd

175.56 --> 181.2
normally at least one person would have

178.019 --> 185.72
said hello in chat by now but

181.2 --> 185.72
right anyway yeah I'm doing great

186.54 --> 191.57999999999998
went to bed really early for my doing

188.819 --> 195.319
yesterday uh was it

191.58 --> 195.31900000000002
half past 12. so

196.319 --> 200.599
I really wanted that extra arrest

203.879 --> 208.79899999999998
also took a shower right before bed so

205.98 --> 211.73899999999998
my hair is extra fluffy now

208.799 --> 217.28
right hey flat fellow thank you for the

211.739 --> 217.28
99 sets 99 cent Super Chat donation

226.56 --> 233.239
first in chat

229.92 --> 233.23899999999998
to actually say hello

234.54 --> 237.14
right

241.319 --> 244.33999999999997
let's see

244.379 --> 250.64
yeah yesterday's Flat Earth debate was

246.84 --> 250.64000000000001
quite different from the day before

251.04 --> 255.79899999999998
was a different atmosphere a different

254.099 --> 259.739
energy

255.799 --> 263.1
yeah very good actually

259.739 --> 264.419
and I didn't have the same issues or

263.1 --> 266.16
rather people didn't have the same

264.419 --> 269.0
issues with me on the other hand I was

266.16 --> 269.0
really focused on

269.639 --> 272.06
um yeah

272.639 --> 278.04
keeping my composure No need no chats

276.0 --> 279.24
only super chats today okay well that's

278.04 --> 282.6
fine

279.24 --> 285.139
I'm getting that flat fellow hey Gadget

282.6 --> 285.139
inspector

290.34 --> 294.11999999999995
uh

292.02 --> 296.639
but anyway yeah yesterday's flight of

294.12 --> 301.16
debate was good didn't last super long

296.639 --> 301.16
the after show but yeah it was good

301.56 --> 305.84
uh so was Mitchell from Australia

313.62 --> 318.68
yeah Mitchell was basically

318.84 --> 323.4
use yeah it was all about a drone he was

321.78 --> 324.9
basically I don't know if he already had

323.4 --> 328.46
that drone but

324.9 --> 328.46
basically was demonstrating

329.699 --> 335.759
his drone

332.58 --> 338.4
that great weather over there

335.759 --> 342.259
of course it's somewhere in Australia

338.4 --> 342.25899999999996
but yeah that was that was great

342.479 --> 347.65999999999997
uh

344.759 --> 347.66
let's see what else

354.539 --> 359.81899999999996
hmm

356.46 --> 363.0
right not a lot of other

359.819 --> 364.97900000000004
dreams on my recommended list anyway I

363.0 --> 367.56
mean there's plenty of people out

364.979 --> 370.15999999999997
there's millions of people doing streams

367.56 --> 370.16
out there but

371.52 --> 373.639
um

373.68 --> 379.199
but yeah I spent a lot of time gaming

377.819 --> 380.639
I got

379.199 --> 385.58000000000004
yeah

380.639 --> 385.58
got past a difficult stage in the game

387.0 --> 390.6
foreign

388.16 --> 393.53900000000004
so yeah man

390.6 --> 397.319
like bumped into some really good music

393.539 --> 398.759
like wow again it's it's just like with

397.319 --> 401.03900000000004
the previous game

398.759 --> 403.62
like there's some songs in there with

401.039 --> 406.74
some moments that are just like really

403.62 --> 408.539
good like whoa it blows my mind and that

406.74 --> 411.06
that is present

408.539 --> 414.0
in the music of this game too

411.06 --> 416.16
actually more of those types of moment I

414.0 --> 418.56
almost have to say that the average

416.16 --> 421.199
music is even better although it's yeah

418.56 --> 423.18
it's a different theme

421.199 --> 425.039
of course it's another game but it's

423.18 --> 426.84000000000003
also the entire setting is different

425.039 --> 430.34
because in the first one it's like cake

426.84 --> 430.34
maker it's really all about

430.8 --> 433.52000000000004
turning

434.0 --> 437.84
like chaotic

438.18 --> 443.94
uh

440.699 --> 446.22
an organized lens into a kingdom and

443.94 --> 448.319
like the Musical theme was had to do

446.22 --> 450.78000000000003
with like the main enemy which was like

448.319 --> 454.139
the first world which is

450.78 --> 456.84
like a sort of a paradisal dimension

454.139 --> 459.599
that I guess is built into the cosmoginy

456.84 --> 462.84
to be the origin point of all life and

459.599 --> 465.3
all that it's yeah

462.84 --> 468.0
it was interesting but the second one is

465.3 --> 472.319
all about kind of like a

468.0 --> 475.139
Crusade against a demonic invasion

472.319 --> 477.74
like really elaborately but yeah demonic

475.139 --> 481.199
invasion in this case is like literally

477.74 --> 482.539
creatures from the hell Dimension or the

481.199 --> 485.22
abyss

482.539 --> 488.039
invading through like a

485.22 --> 491.16
sort of a rift

488.039 --> 493.68
like widespread across the land between

491.16 --> 496.8
the dimensions and the whole theme is

493.68 --> 500.099
very Crusade

496.8 --> 503.639
a lot of yeah in that theme much more

500.099 --> 505.86
that of a feel and they got some really

503.639 --> 509.639
beautiful

505.86 --> 511.74
like brass work horns and [Â __Â ]

509.639 --> 515.82
and that's difficult

511.74 --> 518.88
but also I'm noticing now that

515.82 --> 521.7
the maker of the music

518.88 --> 523.32
it's just become very good at kind of

521.7 --> 526.019
ripping

523.32 --> 529.44
classical music moments that are like

526.019 --> 534.6
astoundingly beautiful and then weaving

529.44 --> 537.3000000000001
it in to a more regular typical Bass

534.6 --> 539.76
Adventure game theme music

537.3 --> 542.16
so I'm like picking up on how they

539.76 --> 543.48
constructed the music and it's like wow

542.16 --> 544.92
that is

543.48 --> 547.98
brilliant

544.92 --> 550.459
for game music that's that's just

547.98 --> 550.4590000000001
brilliant

555.48 --> 560.519
anyway I'm very much enjoying that game

558.3 --> 563.64
the music especially but

560.519 --> 565.26
yeah I had some earlier obstacles that I

563.64 --> 567.3
spotted like oh maybe there's some

565.26 --> 568.4399999999999
programming in there and there is in a

567.3 --> 570.9799999999999
way

568.44 --> 570.98
but

571.56 --> 576.54
like it's pretty much blending in pretty

574.26 --> 579.24
well also I like that

576.54 --> 582.06
well because it's kind of about mostly

579.24 --> 583.8
about an order of paladins that have

582.06 --> 585.959
been fighting against that demonic

583.8 --> 588.12
Invasion for like a century

585.959 --> 591.7199999999999
in the game

588.12 --> 594.66
there's just a lot of attention spent on

591.72 --> 598.019
like like the depth of in the honor code

594.66 --> 601.019
and all that of paladins

598.019 --> 604.68
and I really like that because they took

601.019 --> 608.04
it very serious and it makes it

604.68 --> 610.8
feel like they didn't just poo poo that

608.04 --> 613.0999999999999
so I just yeah anyway me and my video

610.8 --> 613.0999999999999
games

613.92 --> 618.36
I like it

615.48 --> 620.72
Pathfinder Wrath of the righteous I like

618.36 --> 620.72
the game

624.3 --> 629.279
like they even had some really

626.82 --> 632.4590000000001
fascinating ideas

629.279 --> 635.64
like grafted into the story build like

632.459 --> 639.18
there's this weird cult this is just a

635.64 --> 640.5
like basically one level in the game

639.18 --> 644.16
but

640.5 --> 647.459
with a lot of attention spent to just

644.16 --> 651.24
like the entire world story setup

647.459 --> 653.779
so there's this weird cult in the game

651.24 --> 653.779
like

654.06 --> 658.68
D and D

656.519 --> 660.779
it's hard to describe but it's like a

658.68 --> 662.9399999999999
cult the segregated people that have

660.779 --> 664.82
separated themselves but they all

662.94 --> 667.74
they're like super

664.82 --> 670.6800000000001
anti-discriminatory even cross species

667.74 --> 673.62
so they literally have like demons

670.68 --> 675.2399999999999
in their Cults this is not really much

673.62 --> 676.8
of consequence in the game it's just

675.24 --> 678.66
like the weird thing you bump into and

676.8 --> 681.12
then you have to deal with it

678.66 --> 683.6999999999999
they had like literal demons that would

681.12 --> 686.76
then Escape

683.7 --> 689.7
the war of the Abyss on the earth and

686.76 --> 692.04
actually become part of that cult with

689.7 --> 694.98
the humans and then like nobody is

692.04 --> 697.98
allowed to basically

694.98 --> 697.98
discriminate

699.6 --> 703.98
I just thought it was really fascinating

701.82 --> 706.5600000000001
bumping into that

703.98 --> 708.54
because it also plays into like yeah the

706.56 --> 711.7199999999999
nature of these creatures because they

708.54 --> 713.9399999999999
are evil like they really are evil can't

711.72 --> 716.88
help themselves

713.94 --> 718.62
but it's yeah all right

716.88 --> 720.18
I'm just kind of full of the game right

718.62 --> 723.18
now

720.18 --> 725.9399999999999
to be fair I was actually playing it

723.18 --> 727.9799999999999
right before the show Just For The Music

725.94 --> 730.44
really

727.98 --> 732.899
just like go through character creation

730.44 --> 735.1800000000001
processes and then just listen to The

732.899 --> 737.339
Amazing Music in the background in

735.18 --> 740.18
between

737.339 --> 740.1800000000001
ah

748.86 --> 755.279
right anyway back to you guys

752.339 --> 759.139
you're playing U-boat

755.279 --> 759.139
okay never heard of that

765.72 --> 772.139
I

767.76 --> 775.139
Mike zidunich Jared 306

772.139 --> 775.139
snowbirds

776.04 --> 782.16
right in the meantime out here

779.519 --> 784.26
with leather land

782.16 --> 788.16
yeah it's no wonder that I'm kind of

784.26 --> 790.56
like trying to escape into the game

788.16 --> 793.079
because there's just a lot of [Â __Â ]

790.56 --> 797.8389999999999
nonsense going on out there

793.079 --> 797.8389999999999
and it's kind of getting annoying to me

804.6 --> 810.38
like there's some people out there that

807.24 --> 814.2
are just they're really trying to get

810.38 --> 817.82
go after David Wise a lot

814.2 --> 817.82
and I just don't get it

826.199 --> 831.899
also I got notified by the guys that

830.06 --> 834.18
Bob

831.899 --> 839.82
from globusters

834.18 --> 843.06
is like really Ultra doubling down again

839.82 --> 845.94
on this well on his gravity concept he

843.06 --> 849.0189999999999
even calls it gravity again

845.94 --> 849.019
so that happened

853.38 --> 858.5
another go at sleeping or yeah

855.779 --> 858.5
exactly

865.079 --> 871.199
I have the best daily morning Flat Earth

868.26 --> 873.66
live stream from the Netherlands well

871.199 --> 876.7199999999999
yeah flat fellow but that's because I'm

873.66 --> 879.0
probably the only Morning Show live

876.72 --> 880.8000000000001
stream from the Netherlands that does it

879.0 --> 882.959
in English

880.8 --> 886.9399999999999
I mean I'll bet there's like other

882.959 --> 886.9399999999999
people in the Netherlands that have like

888.42 --> 893.519
like live streams doing stuff and

891.24 --> 895.32
talking about flatter I don't really

893.519 --> 898.26
know about them though

895.32 --> 901.2600000000001
I mean most shows out here are are all

898.26 --> 904.38
kind of like focused on

901.26 --> 909.199
uh politics and

904.38 --> 909.199
V and C policy so

913.8 --> 918.7199999999999
what are your thoughts on the metaverse

916.44 --> 921.74
while steamy traveler it's not a very

918.72 --> 921.74
original concept

921.899 --> 928.1
I mean there's already been things out

924.48 --> 928.1
there like Second Life

928.199 --> 931.579
and that was around

931.98 --> 938.1800000000001
like

933.66 --> 938.18
in yeah the early 2000s

938.699 --> 945.5999999999999
except this in this case it's like meta

943.139 --> 949.6800000000001
verse

945.6 --> 953.0400000000001
Facebook as a really huge platform

949.68 --> 956.0
that's already manifested to kind of

953.04 --> 956.0
advertise it

956.759 --> 961.6800000000001
our second life was kind of its own

959.339 --> 963.36
separate project

961.68 --> 966.899
I think it's been

963.36 --> 971.279
pretty successful that project

966.899 --> 974.16
like this have been there's like I've

971.279 --> 978.24
known people that were like even that

974.16 --> 980.9399999999999
designed things for in Second Life

978.24 --> 982.38
like virtual dresses and would sell it

980.94 --> 985.32
for like

982.38 --> 987.66
hundreds of dollars it's crazy

985.32 --> 990.259
but that worked apparently that people

987.66 --> 990.259
did that

991.86 --> 998.88
right so this is like a a more big

996.06 --> 1001.0999999999999
rollout of the same type of thing except

998.88 --> 1002.8389999999999
in this case it's like 3D goggles

1001.1 --> 1004.82
involved

1002.839 --> 1006.5
and it's not surprising like we should

1004.82 --> 1008.6
have all seen this coming because

1006.5 --> 1011.42
Facebook

1008.6 --> 1014.0600000000001
like bought up

1011.42 --> 1016.2199999999999
3D goggle programs

1014.06 --> 1020.0189999999999
like even a decade ago I don't know if

1016.22 --> 1020.019
anybody picked up on that I did

1021.32 --> 1025.779
because there was like uh what's it

1023.42 --> 1025.779
called again

1030.26 --> 1033.579
3D goggle project

1034.1 --> 1038.8999999999999
uh

1035.72 --> 1041.179
and they bought it Facebook bought it

1038.9 --> 1043.299
so it's called again

1041.179 --> 1043.299
um

1047.059 --> 1053.799
I can't remember the name damn it

1051.74 --> 1059.2
huh

1053.799 --> 1059.2
could probably Google it just saying

1061.24 --> 1067.22
Facebook

1063.22 --> 1067.22
buying 3D

1068.12 --> 1075.1599999999999
goggle

1069.919 --> 1075.16
or what is it virtual reality

1080.419 --> 1086.539
let's see Oculus that's it yeah see it

1083.48 --> 1089.96
worked wow those things are expensive

1086.539 --> 1092.9
right so there was an Oculus development

1089.96 --> 1095.419
project an older friend of mine who's

1092.9 --> 1098.48
absolutely not a flat earther was into

1095.419 --> 1101.24
that he even like bought

1098.48 --> 1105.32
like a better version of that I that's

1101.24 --> 1107.96
like the one I used I even used that and

1105.32 --> 1110.059
was severely disappointed because of the

1107.96 --> 1112.1000000000001
massive delay

1110.059 --> 1113.84
like there were all kinds of developers

1112.1 --> 1115.8799999999999
problems

1113.84 --> 1118.52
but it was still interesting and it was

1115.88 --> 1120.0200000000002
like extremely cheap and that was what

1118.52 --> 1122.6
made it kind of interesting I guess

1120.02 --> 1125.84
because before that it was always like

1122.6 --> 1128.4189999999999
thousands of dollars to do anything with

1125.84 --> 1131.1789999999999
something like that

1128.419 --> 1133.88
but then I heard that Facebook bought

1131.179 --> 1135.98
that project so it's not surprising that

1133.88 --> 1138.3400000000001
they're making a move like the metaverse

1135.98 --> 1138.34
at all

1146.14 --> 1150.22
sure steamy Traveler

1150.919 --> 1155.38
hey Nathan Oakley 1980. good to see you

1158.24 --> 1160.66
all right

1163.16 --> 1167.9
love to hear my thoughts on simulation

1165.919 --> 1171.88
Theory well that depends on what kind of

1167.9 --> 1171.88
simulation Theory you're referring to

1179.66 --> 1186.0800000000002
I mean I've been saying

1183.2 --> 1187.7
the realm is similatory in nature like

1186.08 --> 1189.26
the fabric

1187.7 --> 1191.9
of matter

1189.26 --> 1194.0
and all substances all things is

1191.9 --> 1196.3400000000001
simulatory in nature like the building

1194.0 --> 1198.38
blocks are simulatory that doesn't mean

1196.34 --> 1202.1589999999999
that it is a simulation

1198.38 --> 1207.14
because that board typically would imply

1202.159 --> 1210.0800000000002
that it is not the real thing it is

1207.14 --> 1213.38
but the way it's constructed is like

1210.08 --> 1216.5
very similar to how we would construct

1213.38 --> 1220.419
the simulation like the building blocks

1216.5 --> 1220.419
of everything kind of show that

1223.94 --> 1228.919
that's

1225.559 --> 1233.08
I think yeah there's scientists that

1228.919 --> 1233.0800000000002
even basically Embrace that

1233.12 --> 1238.6999999999998
in their own way

1235.76 --> 1241.1
like yeah it seems like there's a

1238.7 --> 1244.46
a limited depth

1241.1 --> 1246.98
of material nature and

1244.46 --> 1250.28
and after some point it just seems like

1246.98 --> 1252.8600000000001
it it's more like a input from a

1250.28 --> 1256.82
simulation

1252.86 --> 1259.58
that's kind of stared from the outside

1256.82 --> 1261.86
and yeah that that works perfectly fine

1259.58 --> 1264.5
especially if you realize there is a

1261.86 --> 1268.52
designer and a god

1264.5 --> 1273.02
who not not only designed all of

1268.52 --> 1275.0
creation but is also present outside of

1273.02 --> 1278.4189999999999
creation

1275.0 --> 1281.08
as a source as the ultimate source of

1278.419 --> 1281.0800000000002
all information

1286.4 --> 1290.8400000000001
and that works perfectly with the

1288.919 --> 1294.98
simulation Theory

1290.84 --> 1297.1999999999998
because we are basically in his

1294.98 --> 1298.84
simulation

1297.2 --> 1301.5800000000002
he already

1298.84 --> 1304.1
rolled out all the informations all the

1301.58 --> 1307.8999999999999
impulse the possibilities and it's now

1304.1 --> 1307.8999999999999
just being enacted

1309.62 --> 1315.86
so you could say yeah this is like God

1311.96 --> 1318.14
simulation but it is the real thing

1315.86 --> 1320.9189999999999
this is not a

1318.14 --> 1320.919
test run

1321.44 --> 1326.14
but it might be like a first stage

1330.26 --> 1335.24
anyway

1331.82 --> 1337.8999999999999
I hope that answers that question that

1335.24 --> 1337.9
flat fellow

1346.039 --> 1353.059
right the issue is with the word

1348.32 --> 1355.76
simulation because simulation is

1353.059 --> 1358.34
like a

1355.76 --> 1362.08
the word indicates it is kind of like a

1358.34 --> 1362.08
clone of something else

1364.88 --> 1370.5800000000002
right so it's like a sub thing a sub

1368.299 --> 1372.74
reality a simulation is like a sub

1370.58 --> 1375.6399999999999
reality but in this case it is the

1372.74 --> 1375.64
reality but

1376.159 --> 1382.88
yeah unless you consider that God is the

1379.7 --> 1386.179
original and that reality is like

1382.88 --> 1390.5590000000002
literally the simulation

1386.179 --> 1394.0
of what God did I don't know

1390.559 --> 1394.0
it's getting a bit convoluted

1400.6 --> 1404.6
right anyway

1405.98 --> 1411.919
all makes you think and philosophize but

1408.679 --> 1414.8600000000001
effectively the metaverse is

1411.919 --> 1417.0200000000002
is not really like a revolution it's

1414.86 --> 1419.299
more like a devolution

1417.02 --> 1422.48
it's just an offering

1419.299 --> 1426.62
of an Escapist Realm

1422.48 --> 1430.64
right so instead of escaping temporarily

1426.62 --> 1433.3999999999999
in a book or in a video game or a movie

1430.64 --> 1435.5590000000002
with its own world and all that

1433.4 --> 1437.0590000000002
you escape in a virtual reality

1435.559 --> 1440.539
environment

1437.059 --> 1443.24
that is really there specifically to

1440.539 --> 1445.1589999999999
distract you away from your Sorrows of

1443.24 --> 1447.02
reality

1445.159 --> 1449.179
now practically

1447.02 --> 1450.86
that will only lead to everything

1449.179 --> 1453.02
becoming worse

1450.86 --> 1456.1399999999999
because if You Escape From Misery and

1453.02 --> 1457.8799999999999
reality like truly try to not think

1456.14 --> 1460.46
about it

1457.88 --> 1464.0
it's probably gonna get worse

1460.46 --> 1466.1000000000001
and escapism makes it tougher eventually

1464.0 --> 1468.7
to even confront what you're trying to

1466.1 --> 1468.6999999999998
escape from

1471.919 --> 1478.22
so if your life gets messed up and you

1475.88 --> 1479.659
get addicted to the metaverse and this

1478.22 --> 1482.14
is something that a lot of people kind

1479.659 --> 1482.14
of see coming

1482.299 --> 1486.08
your life is messed up but you're

1484.4 --> 1487.94
addicted to the metaverse yeah then you

1486.08 --> 1489.62
might end up literally like a homeless

1487.94 --> 1492.5
guy

1489.62 --> 1495.799
with that thing on

1492.5 --> 1497.6
sitting in Corners everywhere they don't

1495.799 --> 1500.36
know how to fix their life again but

1497.6 --> 1502.84
they can still be somebody in the

1500.36 --> 1502.84
metaphors

1505.82 --> 1510.26
and like everybody's seeing that coming

1507.86 --> 1514.539
and that is coming

1510.26 --> 1514.539
that that will happen as a consequence

1515.24 --> 1520.34
now you could argue okay so if the

1518.12 --> 1521.4189999999999
metaphors wasn't there what would these

1520.34 --> 1524.36
people

1521.419 --> 1526.88
having breakdowns in their lives what

1524.36 --> 1529.4189999999999
would they do as an alternative if it

1526.88 --> 1529.419
wasn't there

1531.5 --> 1536.24
I mean they might literally like go as

1534.32 --> 1537.6789999999999
far as to commit suicide or something

1536.24 --> 1539.659
but

1537.679 --> 1541.22
yeah that's not really an excuse why

1539.659 --> 1544.22
it's a good thing that there is a

1541.22 --> 1548.659
metaverse there they might also just

1544.22 --> 1552.26
man up confront the issues and like

1548.659 --> 1554.8400000000001
restart their life and build it up again

1552.26 --> 1557.6589999999999
and the metaphors would then

1554.84 --> 1559.58
well obviously distract away from that

1557.659 --> 1562.1000000000001
and potentially prevent people from

1559.58 --> 1566.1999999999998
going there

1562.1 --> 1566.1999999999998
so those are the hazards

1576.799 --> 1579.4
ah

1580.6 --> 1585.74
man I got a really good Focus today it

1584.12 --> 1590.3799999999999
was great

1585.74 --> 1590.38
talk in my native language I I am not a

1591.44 --> 1598.8200000000002
a press to play simulator I don't just

1595.94 --> 1600.74
do requests

1598.82 --> 1603.6789999999999
It's gotta have a purpose It's gotta

1600.74 --> 1606.159
have a context that fits in what we're

1603.679 --> 1606.159
talking about

1610.22 --> 1616.84
I've talked plenty in my native language

1613.52 --> 1616.84
on live streams

1617.539 --> 1623.12
I have a Dutch show

1620.419 --> 1626.44
like one episode of flatter talks that I

1623.12 --> 1626.4399999999998
did entirely in Dutch

1627.44 --> 1633.94
you can look it up if you want to see me

1629.419 --> 1633.94
speak Dutch that's the the episode

1641.899 --> 1647.4189999999999
you've never heard the language before

1644.84 --> 1650.08
really ethnically you've never heard

1647.419 --> 1650.0800000000002
Dutch before

1650.779 --> 1654.559
and you needed Harriet from me I mean

1653.24 --> 1658.58
you could just

1654.559 --> 1661.72
look up videos out there

1658.58 --> 1661.72
with the Dutch language

1671.539 --> 1674.84
I mean if you want I'll link you up to

1673.82 --> 1680.32
my show

1674.84 --> 1680.32
that the Dutch show I could do that

1686.36 --> 1689.799
let's see where is it

1705.32 --> 1709.779
right

1707.179 --> 1709.779
huh

1715.22 --> 1719.3600000000001
there you go here it is you want to see

1717.919 --> 1722.3200000000002
Dutch

1719.36 --> 1722.32
that's it

1733.399 --> 1738.26
did you see glow Busters oh did did you

1737.36 --> 1741.32
see

1738.26 --> 1742.94
you were misspelling a lot of things you

1741.32 --> 1745.1589999999999
were saying there

1742.94 --> 1747.76
before you hit enter America silver

1745.159 --> 1747.7600000000002
Patriot

1750.86 --> 1754.1589999999999
no I didn't see it I don't watch that

1753.2 --> 1758.1200000000001
show

1754.159 --> 1760.64
what I did get pointed at it by guys in

1758.12 --> 1764.0
Skype

1760.64 --> 1765.98
I mentioned it earlier

1764.0 --> 1769.46
things that were going down out there

1765.98 --> 1773.179
and yeah little Busters

1769.46 --> 1776.6000000000001
or yeah Bob like super doubling down

1773.179 --> 1779.419
again on gravity through dielectric

1776.6 --> 1781.52
acceleration I I picked up in that video

1779.419 --> 1784.279
when I watched it that he said

1781.52 --> 1787.84
oh gases are influenced by

1784.279 --> 1787.84
electrostatics oh

1788.48 --> 1790.659
thank you

1792.74 --> 1799.22
[Â __Â ] yeah that's pointless it doesn't

1795.74 --> 1801.26
do it over a range like it's all short

1799.22 --> 1802.88
range every demonstration will be short

1801.26 --> 1807.86
range

1802.88 --> 1810.14
if you're gonna offset apparent density

1807.86 --> 1811.8799999999999
of an object you're gonna need a

1810.14 --> 1814.279
landline to do it

1811.88 --> 1816.679
you can't do it over distance you can't

1814.279 --> 1819.38
do it like with nothing no physical

1816.679 --> 1822.7
Connection in between so and of course

1819.38 --> 1822.7
he's not addressing that

1839.72 --> 1844.72
driving okay America silver Patriot

1862.039 --> 1867.86
uh yeah that flat fellow land

1865.039 --> 1870.86
reclamation project you mean the

1867.86 --> 1870.86
polaring

1871.58 --> 1877.8799999999999
we did indeed Pioneer that

1874.7 --> 1880.419
it was what defined our country very

1877.88 --> 1880.419
early on

1882.44 --> 1887.779
you could potentially say that the

1884.96 --> 1890.1200000000001
Netherlands became all about poldering

1887.779 --> 1892.58
due to the mud flood which was right

1890.12 --> 1894.0189999999998
around that time supposedly

1892.58 --> 1896.74
allegedly

1894.019 --> 1896.74
and yeah

1898.22 --> 1903.8600000000001
pretty handy to go for land reclamation

1901.58 --> 1905.4189999999999
when it's all or a lot of things are

1903.86 --> 1908.1789999999999
covered under mud

1905.419 --> 1911.24
and yeah you can make

1908.179 --> 1914.0590000000002
solid landscape out of mud too and

1911.24 --> 1916.82
so yeah good time to like rearrange the

1914.059 --> 1919.1789999999999
landscape I'd say so to me it makes

1916.82 --> 1919.1789999999999
sense

1921.44 --> 1925.0
that all of that happened

1925.1 --> 1929.779
it would make less sense if it if we

1927.62 --> 1932.1789999999999
started poldering and all that out of

1929.779 --> 1933.559
nowhere like suddenly we decide to start

1932.179 --> 1937.64
doing that

1933.559 --> 1940.1589999999999
but if something happened in that time

1937.64 --> 1942.26
like a mud flood that changed the

1940.159 --> 1944.0
landscape then it makes sense you would

1942.26 --> 1946.46
have to make effort you would have to

1944.0 --> 1948.74
organize to kind of clean up the place

1946.46 --> 1951.98
well if you have a smart plan you might

1948.74 --> 1955.279
as well then use that momentum

1951.98 --> 1956.72
to kind of like redefine landscape

1955.279 --> 1960.58
engineering

1956.72 --> 1960.58
so that makes sense to me

1960.74 --> 1969.159
that the Dutch like started poldering

1965.24 --> 1969.159
in response to the mud flood

1987.32 --> 1991.399
I mean if a whole bunch of places

1989.059 --> 1993.08
certainly got covered with mud it's like

1991.399 --> 1995.6
a whole new industry it's like okay

1993.08 --> 1996.799
we're poldering we can rearrange

1995.6 --> 1998.84
landscape there's going to be a whole

1996.799 --> 2002.3799999999999
bunch of places out there

1998.84 --> 2005.3799999999999
that could use that if they want our

2002.38 --> 2007.24
services right

2005.38 --> 2010.019
no

2007.24 --> 2010.019
okay

2010.779 --> 2017.34
no global warming or sea rise yeah no of

2013.6 --> 2017.34
course no sea rise is ridiculous

2027.34 --> 2033.8799999999999
I mean if any of that was true then we'd

2030.82 --> 2036.82
be living in Water World like the movie

2033.88 --> 2039.519
Water World by now it's not that

2036.82 --> 2042.299
it just it will never be like that it's

2039.519 --> 2042.299
all nonsense

2043.12 --> 2048.779
flood due to temperature change is

2046.12 --> 2048.779
nonsense

2051.94 --> 2057.06
I mean temporary maybe you know when

2057.579 --> 2063.52
temperatures change and like ice chunk

2061.599 --> 2065.3790000000004
suddenly break off because of the

2063.52 --> 2068.44
temperature change yeah it might cause a

2065.379 --> 2070.72
temporary flood like shifting

2068.44 --> 2072.46
of large masses in the ocean might cause

2070.72 --> 2075.879
a temporary flood but it's not going to

2072.46 --> 2078.78
be like a rise of the water that is

2075.879 --> 2078.7799999999997
complete nonsense

2080.26 --> 2085.0600000000004
and there is no example of that anywhere

2083.5 --> 2087.04
throughout history where that happened

2085.06 --> 2090.24
except

2087.04 --> 2093.879
for the great flood

2090.24 --> 2097.06
one certain time no relation no relation

2093.879 --> 2099.64
whatsoever to any situation concerning

2097.06 --> 2103.06
ice caps it was like a giant

2099.64 --> 2106.06
change where like everything

2103.06 --> 2109.839
changed because of a giant insertion of

2106.06 --> 2111.7
water that came from above not from the

2109.839 --> 2113.92
sides

2111.7 --> 2115.839
wasn't like a giant tidal wave that

2113.92 --> 2117.7000000000003
covered everything no it just started

2115.839 --> 2121.02
raining

2117.7 --> 2121.02
and never stopped

2135.22 --> 2140.02
still pushed on Natalia yeah dude George

2138.16 --> 2143.2
Sanford

2140.02 --> 2146.339
so is the moon landing

2143.2 --> 2146.339
I mean come on

2153.28 --> 2158.46
you want to learn Dutch do you okay

2155.5 --> 2158.46
interesting

2159.52 --> 2165.28
It's actually an extremely difficult

2162.099 --> 2169.2000000000003
language to master I mean you might be

2165.28 --> 2169.2000000000003
able to learn some superficial Dutch

2169.3 --> 2173.579
to be relatively understood

2173.74 --> 2178.6189999999997
but like true Dutch is

2185.82 --> 2190.56
I thought somebody was knocking on the

2188.44 --> 2190.56
door

2193.359 --> 2199.18
foreign

2195.42 --> 2202.26
loses volume when it melts but it's not

2199.18 --> 2202.2599999999998
even relevant Cleary

2202.48 --> 2210.04
because ice also floats so a floating

2207.339 --> 2212.32
iceberg

2210.04 --> 2216.599
melting doesn't change the water level

2212.32 --> 2216.599
at all like in the slightest

2219.28 --> 2223.92
because it's already in there

2225.22 --> 2232.359
now theoretically

2228.7 --> 2233.7999999999997
let's just say the giant ice ring or ice

2232.359 --> 2237.0989999999997
wall

2233.8 --> 2241.48
if you would consider that that's all a

2237.099 --> 2245.619
giant chunk of ice towering up on solid

2241.48 --> 2248.14
land now if that would to melt somehow

2245.619 --> 2250.6600000000003
all of it yeah that might kind of shift

2248.14 --> 2252.7599999999998
the oceans a bit

2250.66 --> 2254.92
unless it has somewhere else to go

2252.76 --> 2259.5
because we don't even know if there is

2254.92 --> 2262.48
like a mechanism that well that causes

2259.5 --> 2263.8
extra water to kind of drain away we

2262.48 --> 2266.859
don't know

2263.8 --> 2270.52
how the oceans are mechanically

2266.859 --> 2272.859
regulated here other than through the

2270.52 --> 2274.359
yeah the water the typical water weather

2272.859 --> 2277.5
cycle

2274.359 --> 2277.5
there might be like

2280.54 --> 2285.94
just like in

2283.359 --> 2289.2999999999997
Hydro mechanics and all that there might

2285.94 --> 2292.119
be like a valve somewhere in Earth

2289.3 --> 2295.3590000000004
that if there's a certain level of water

2292.119 --> 2297.099
pressure that it kind of vents off some

2295.359 --> 2301.14
of that water to

2297.099 --> 2301.1400000000003
another section of the design

2303.88 --> 2309.2200000000003
I mean that would make sense to me

2307.0 --> 2311.56
that way whatever happens the water

2309.22 --> 2314.4399999999996
level is always going to be stable

2311.56 --> 2315.46
and it seems to be extremely stable so

2314.44 --> 2318.16
far

2315.46 --> 2321.66
except for the one big flood but that's

2318.16 --> 2321.66
completely different scenario

2323.26 --> 2328.96
right so theoretically let's say there

2326.859 --> 2331.359
is a giant amount of ice on land

2328.96 --> 2332.98
somewhere and it would all melt

2331.359 --> 2336.04
and it wouldn't be able to drain away

2332.98 --> 2339.22
yes that might cause a flood

2336.04 --> 2342.099
how is that going to be accomplished

2339.22 --> 2344.7999999999997
it's never going to be accomplished

2342.099 --> 2346.54
because those regions where those ice

2344.8 --> 2349.0
walls are they are there for a while

2346.54 --> 2351.22
that didn't just grow overnight and that

2349.0 --> 2354.04
means it's never

2351.22 --> 2356.5
going to be able to melt

2354.04 --> 2360.099
so even if certainly the temperature is

2356.5 --> 2363.4
like mid realm would change a lot

2360.099 --> 2367.1800000000003
it's still not going to be enough to

2363.4 --> 2369.7000000000003
to make those ice walls melt at all

2367.18 --> 2372.8799999999997
like we would all be a giant desert

2369.7 --> 2376.3199999999997
before those things would start to melt

2372.88 --> 2376.32
that's my suspicion

2380.8 --> 2383.2200000000003
all right

2387.76 --> 2392.619
so yeah global warming is All Pure

2391.3 --> 2394.8390000000004
nonsense

2392.619 --> 2397.42
especially concerning Rising water

2394.839 --> 2399.64
levels that is just nonsense it will

2397.42 --> 2401.619
always be nonsense it's never ever gonna

2399.64 --> 2403.54
happen if there's going to be some water

2401.619 --> 2405.94
line change

2403.54 --> 2407.8
it's going to be really big and it will

2405.94 --> 2410.8
have nothing to do with climate change

2407.8 --> 2413.3390000000004
but yeah it's predicted not to happen

2410.8 --> 2413.3390000000004
like that

2414.22 --> 2418.5989999999997
biblically at least

2415.96 --> 2421.14
and I see no other reason to assume why

2418.599 --> 2421.1400000000003
it would happen

2422.56 --> 2426.359
it's not even

2423.76 --> 2426.3590000000004
a note guys

2427.18 --> 2429.8999999999996
what do you mean

2431.98 --> 2436.079
there's just an IC allegedly yeah

2450.46 --> 2455.26
Rivers empty into oceans 24 7 a day but

2453.7 --> 2457.5989999999997
it never Rises right

2455.26 --> 2459.94
exactly

2457.599 --> 2463.0
then again where did that water even

2459.94 --> 2464.859
come from in those Rivers right there's

2463.0 --> 2466.9
been people that

2464.859 --> 2468.46
this is a long time ago that have kind

2466.9 --> 2470.6800000000003
of suggested

2468.46 --> 2473.319
haphazardly and I thought it was an

2470.68 --> 2475.2999999999997
interesting idea is that the mountains

2473.319 --> 2479.339
in their own way kind of like

2475.3 --> 2479.3390000000004
suck up groundwater

2481.3 --> 2485.8590000000004
and that that's partially like where

2484.06 --> 2490.14
river water even comes from that it

2485.859 --> 2490.14
doesn't just all come there by rain

2490.18 --> 2497.68
but that it's actually kind of like

2494.319 --> 2499.0
through some natural effect being pulled

2497.68 --> 2502.06
up The Rock

2499.0 --> 2504.579
in some areas

2502.06 --> 2506.2
so yeah that would

2504.579 --> 2508.2400000000002
I guess

2506.2 --> 2511.1189999999997
explain

2508.24 --> 2514.2999999999997
that if there's constantly Rivers going

2511.119 --> 2517.0
down into the ocean that well

2514.3 --> 2519.3390000000004
it's almost like a fountain system it's

2517.0 --> 2520.3
just being sup sucked up into the

2519.339 --> 2522.7
mountain

2520.3 --> 2525.1600000000003
so that it all there's just this cycle

2522.7 --> 2526.96
not just like above ground with the

2525.16 --> 2530.44
clouds and the water and the rain but

2526.96 --> 2530.44
also subterrestrial

2535.78 --> 2541.48
so that could explain that

2539.2 --> 2545.2599999999998
but yeah

2541.48 --> 2548.02
it's kind of speculatory

2545.26 --> 2550.5600000000004
anyway yeah the ocean levels are not

2548.02 --> 2550.56
gonna change

2551.319 --> 2556.38
not

2553.119 --> 2556.38
dramatically anyway

2567.94 --> 2575.2200000000003
I hope you say they Rose from the third

2571.119 --> 2575.2200000000003
world into our what does that even mean

2578.619 --> 2583.7200000000003
oh she said wait

2580.839 --> 2584.98
they said they came from inside the

2583.72 --> 2589.5
Earth right

2584.98 --> 2589.5
from a level below us interesting

2599.38 --> 2604.44
they say we are the fourth world

2602.02 --> 2604.44
huh

2605.38 --> 2607.98
okay

2625.48 --> 2633.359
low service Day by the way and Crockett

2628.359 --> 2633.359
and set Seth wildenberg

2651.099 --> 2655.5
yeah but it is an interesting thing to

2653.079 --> 2655.5
think about

2657.88 --> 2662.6800000000003
to just realize like the Earth the way

2660.099 --> 2665.38
it is it's not just some random [Â __Â ]

2662.68 --> 2668.0789999999997
that just happens to work like this

2665.38 --> 2672.06
on a ball in a giant vacuum but that

2668.079 --> 2675.48
it's actually more like a terrarium

2672.06 --> 2675.48
confined Realm

2675.64 --> 2681.22
with potentially weird dimensional

2678.9 --> 2684.04
aspects about it where there's literally

2681.22 --> 2686.68
a limitation to spatial volume

2684.04 --> 2687.54
but still with potential connections to

2686.68 --> 2690.94
other

2687.54 --> 2694.3
realm segments that might have like even

2690.94 --> 2698.94
mechanical implications

2694.3 --> 2701.8590000000004
as to interactions between these realms

2698.94 --> 2704.68
and materials that could be exchanged

2701.859 --> 2707.68
like how I theorized that maybe the

2704.68 --> 2711.64
flood was actually the emptying

2707.68 --> 2713.56
of a realm filled up with water above us

2711.64 --> 2715.9
like there was a gate and it just

2713.56 --> 2718.359
drained into our Realm

2715.9 --> 2720.6600000000003
and then after a while drained away

2718.359 --> 2720.66
again

2721.48 --> 2724.66
it's interesting to think about those

2723.099 --> 2727.7400000000002
types of things

2724.66 --> 2727.74
how that would work

2730.24 --> 2733.24
because I'm

2731.68 --> 2737.2
I don't know

2733.24 --> 2740.0789999999997
it's time passes I've just become

2737.2 --> 2740.98
almost assured like whatever this realm

2740.079 --> 2744.28
is

2740.98 --> 2748.18
it's not the only place

2744.28 --> 2750.579
it might be the Main Place

2748.18 --> 2753.52
but not the only place

2750.579 --> 2757.8590000000004
right it might be just a little segment

2753.52 --> 2757.859
in a whole range of realms

2758.319 --> 2763.3
or at least there would be like sub

2762.099 --> 2766.599
realms

2763.3 --> 2769.78
that were integral to its functioning

2766.599 --> 2771.94
and unavailable for us spatially

2769.78 --> 2774.8190000000004
outside of it

2771.94 --> 2777.099
like the operational realms

2774.819 --> 2779.079
that are there specifically to keep the

2777.099 --> 2781.42
Earth realm functioning the way it does

2779.079 --> 2784.119
or something

2781.42 --> 2786.78
at least that's very likely to be there

2784.119 --> 2786.78
in some way

2799.3 --> 2801.9
what

2808.66 --> 2812.8799999999997
what are you talking about seeking star

2810.64 --> 2812.8799999999997
water

2814.96 --> 2820.42
the Sahara

2816.819 --> 2823.619
source of the Hurricanes what

2820.42 --> 2823.619
that makes no sense

2823.78 --> 2829.7200000000003
or are you not talking about like the

2826.24 --> 2831.7
Sahara desert in North Africa

2829.72 --> 2834.7799999999997
so I'm pretty sure that's not the origin

2831.7 --> 2834.7799999999997
point of hurricanes

2852.16 --> 2857.0789999999997
dropping crumbs yeah okay but the crumbs

2854.98 --> 2859.619
doesn't seem to make a lot of sense at

2857.079 --> 2859.619
first glance

2860.02 --> 2865.66
yes that's the one and yes it is no no

2863.619 --> 2866.92
it isn't and that makes absolutely no

2865.66 --> 2869.02
sense

2866.92 --> 2871.7200000000003
it's not the origin point of hurricanes

2869.02 --> 2874.0
it doesn't come there hurricanes are not

2871.72 --> 2875.74
even it's like on the other side of the

2874.0 --> 2877.78
world other side

2875.74 --> 2879.7
it's way over on the other side of the

2877.78 --> 2882.579
realm

2879.7 --> 2886.359
hurricanes happen in Asia

2882.579 --> 2890.6800000000003
uh Africa is like right the Pacific

2886.359 --> 2894.0589999999997
Ocean all that Africa is exactly

2890.68 --> 2894.0589999999997
in the opposite place

2897.4 --> 2901.619
no no it isn't that makes no sense

2915.46 --> 2920.02
you can just keep saying it is but that

2917.98 --> 2921.4
makes no sense there is no hurricanes

2920.02 --> 2923.14
coming from Africa do you understand

2921.4 --> 2925.359
seeking star water

2923.14 --> 2927.7599999999998
you could just say yes it is yes it is

2925.359 --> 2929.2599999999998
it isn't there is no hurricanes coming

2927.76 --> 2931.7200000000003
from Africa

2929.26 --> 2933.3390000000004
you might want to drop the nonsense

2931.72 --> 2935.4399999999996
story

2933.339 --> 2937.599
like I don't have to look into something

2935.44 --> 2940.859
to know that's wrong

2937.599 --> 2940.8590000000004
and so should you

2947.2 --> 2954.22
to learn when the winds originate

2950.319 --> 2957.599
there's no hurricanes coming from Africa

2954.22 --> 2957.5989999999997
it makes no sense

2962.2 --> 2968.14
no it isn't

2964.78 --> 2972.96
and I'm not going to side with you on

2968.14 --> 2972.96
you just yes it is no it isn't

2982.119 --> 2985.5
it's that steamy Traveler

2989.26 --> 2993.059
oh that link doesn't work

3071.16 --> 3073.8799999999997
what

3089.88 --> 3095.9
what wait did I mix it up Hurricane and

3093.42 --> 3095.9
cyclone

3097.64 --> 3100.8799999999997
ah Christ

3105.9 --> 3108.6800000000003
okay

3115.079 --> 3120.1800000000003
yeah Christ I made mixed it up never

3117.72 --> 3122.22
mind I'll take it all all that [Â __Â ] back

3120.18 --> 3124.46
that I just said that's just [Â __Â ]

3122.22 --> 3124.4599999999996
great

3124.94 --> 3130.5
I was talking about Cyclones yeah

3128.339 --> 3133.74
hurricanes yeah I guess that they do

3130.5 --> 3138.38
kind of seem to come

3133.74 --> 3138.3799999999997
start up right at the coast of Africa

3158.66 --> 3164.52
[Â __Â ] Aiden when it happens

3162.42 --> 3166.38
okay yeah I take it all back you're

3164.52 --> 3168.3
right you're right yeah hurricanes come

3166.38 --> 3169.8
from Africa hurricanes come from Africa

3168.3 --> 3171.42
hurricanes come from Africa all

3169.8 --> 3173.7000000000003
hurricanes come from Africa they're

3171.42 --> 3175.5
created by Africa yeah hurricanes come

3173.7 --> 3178.8799999999997
from Africa now

3175.5 --> 3178.88
you got a point with that

3198.059 --> 3203.94
sending troops to every no

3201.619 --> 3206.52
besides like what are you gonna do in

3203.94 --> 3208.7400000000002
Africa it's not gonna stop

3206.52 --> 3211.4
the conditions from arising for

3208.74 --> 3211.3999999999996
hurricanes

3211.859 --> 3216.42
takes a great character what to admit

3214.319 --> 3219.14
that I mixed up words and made myself

3216.42 --> 3219.14
look stupid

3219.24 --> 3224.16
I don't know it's just really annoying

3221.52 --> 3228.119
because it wasn't like I was just

3224.16 --> 3230.7
like denying something structural I just

3228.119 --> 3234.0
mixed up the stupid [Â __Â ] words again

3230.7 --> 3236.04
like why do they even have to [Â __Â ]

3234.0 --> 3239.16
separate words for it it makes no sense

3236.04 --> 3242.579
if they just call it one damn thing

3239.16 --> 3245.52
then it'd be like yeah the hurricane the

3242.579 --> 3248.46
tornadoes that hit America and then you

3245.52 --> 3250.98
have the tornadoes that hit Asia and

3248.46 --> 3253.2
that's it no more mix up

3250.98 --> 3255.359
I don't know why they call them two

3253.2 --> 3257.46
separate things it makes no [Â __Â ]

3255.359 --> 3260.2799999999997
sense and it's really annoying and I

3257.46 --> 3263.04
just made a giant mistake because of

3260.28 --> 3266.8190000000004
that [Â __Â ] although I did describe it

3263.04 --> 3268.68
right I did describe like yeah those the

3266.819 --> 3270.66
Asian ones the Asian ones that makes no

3268.68 --> 3272.64
sense that's what I thought but I mixed

3270.66 --> 3274.819
up the damn word I hate it when it

3272.64 --> 3274.819
happens

3275.22 --> 3278.0
foreign

3291.859 --> 3295.92
but there's probably already

3293.88 --> 3298.92
manipulating [Â __Â ]

3295.92 --> 3300.78
I mean off the coast of Africa there's

3298.92 --> 3303.299
Islands there

3300.78 --> 3305.0400000000004
I've heard rumors a long time ago that

3303.299 --> 3307.14
there's like a weather manipulation

3305.04 --> 3310.2599999999998
station

3307.14 --> 3312.9
sort of like harp there that can

3310.26 --> 3315.8590000000004
literally add a whim just stare

3312.9 --> 3315.859
hurricanes

3316.14 --> 3321.839
could just send them in a Direction

3319.26 --> 3323.579
once they arrive

3321.839 --> 3325.94
it's probably been there for like 50

3323.579 --> 3325.94
years

3335.4 --> 3341.76
yeah my point is the eye of the Sahara

3338.04 --> 3342.9
is the central pull of our Realm

3341.76 --> 3343.98
I

3342.9 --> 3347.4
I

3343.98 --> 3351.2
um what are you basing that

3347.4 --> 3351.2000000000003
and what orientation

3351.96 --> 3354.799
I don't get it

3361.319 --> 3364.579
like what Center

3387.059 --> 3391.46
they're also called typhoons right

3393.02 --> 3398.7
typhoon Cyclone hurricane

3395.839 --> 3401.2799999999997
why why do you call like it's all

3398.7 --> 3403.46
exactly the same damn thing I don't get

3401.28 --> 3403.46
it

3410.46 --> 3415.88
based on the NASCAR lines yeah but I

3437.339 --> 3443.0589999999997
I don't see it

3440.46 --> 3443.059
like

3446.099 --> 3450.9
I don't think there is a central point

3448.38 --> 3453.6600000000003
in a realm just none there is no Central

3450.9 --> 3456.42
Point in the realm

3453.66 --> 3459.0589999999997
it's looping there is no central point

3456.42 --> 3462.7400000000002
because of it because space itself Loops

3459.059 --> 3462.7400000000002
you can't designate a center

3471.42 --> 3476.4
like the suggestion of a center point

3474.059 --> 3479.4
would mean that from that Center Point

3476.4 --> 3480.839
you go into all directions

3479.4 --> 3484.559
with

3480.839 --> 3487.2599999999998
the same length same distance up same

3484.559 --> 3489.119
distance down oops North same distance

3487.26 --> 3490.94
South

3489.119 --> 3494.099
and

3490.94 --> 3497.96
similarly a similar distance West and

3494.099 --> 3497.96
East what you're gonna bump into an end

3498.0 --> 3501.079
it makes no sense

3504.839 --> 3509.22
that's like saying they're rectangular

3506.7 --> 3511.9199999999996
looping map or what is it called again

3509.22 --> 3515.16
that map orientation the rectangular one

3511.92 --> 3517.799
that it's literally just confined by a

3515.16 --> 3520.46
barrier literally like that I'm pretty

3517.799 --> 3520.46
sure it's not

3522.66 --> 3527.72
don't think there's like this barrier in

3524.94 --> 3527.7200000000003
the Pacific Ocean

3574.7 --> 3580.3999999999996
Atlantis is in the Atlantic Ocean no no

3577.859 --> 3580.4
it's not

3587.88 --> 3593.4
I mean you would find

3590.64 --> 3594.24
well it on the bottom of the ocean if it

3593.4 --> 3597.2000000000003
were

3594.24 --> 3597.2
it's not there

3597.599 --> 3601.799
what are my thoughts on Evolution it's

3599.7 --> 3604.8799999999997
[Â __Â ] that's my thoughts on it it's

3601.799 --> 3604.88
complete hogwash

3605.64 --> 3611.64
there's no proof for it whatsoever

3608.88 --> 3615.42
Smithsonian has helped to manifest

3611.64 --> 3616.5589999999997
delusions about some virtual super far

3615.42 --> 3618.7200000000003
past

3616.559 --> 3621.559
it's all based in fraud all of it

3618.72 --> 3621.5589999999997
blatantly

3627.42 --> 3631.44
all right but I don't know man I I think

3629.76 --> 3635.8190000000004
Atlantis

3631.44 --> 3638.16
was everything I don't see like oh it's

3635.819 --> 3639.24
over there no it's over there no it was

3638.16 --> 3643.339
it all

3639.24 --> 3643.339
I think Atlantis was the entire world

3649.38 --> 3655.26
so you believe in young Earth no

3652.44 --> 3659.2400000000002
I just know evolution is absolute

3655.26 --> 3662.96
horseshit is mechanically impossible

3659.24 --> 3662.9599999999996
existentially impossible

3663.059 --> 3669.42
it's biologically impossible

3666.78 --> 3673.2200000000003
it's impossible has nothing to do with

3669.42 --> 3673.2200000000003
any [Â __Â ] belief

3673.26 --> 3676.94
it's just impossible

3678.54 --> 3683.04
like you don't even you can be a

3681.119 --> 3685.02
freaking atheist you don't even have to

3683.04 --> 3687.9
believe the Bible or anything and it's

3685.02 --> 3689.4
still impossible do you understand it's

3687.9 --> 3691.079
impossible it doesn't matter if you

3689.4 --> 3694.26
believe nothing or you believe

3691.079 --> 3696.78
everything it's just impossible

3694.26 --> 3697.7400000000002
it's mechanically impossible has nothing

3696.78 --> 3700.38
to do

3697.74 --> 3704.7599999999998
with what you believe happened

3700.38 --> 3704.76
it's simply impossible

3705.78 --> 3713.119
it's not how the design of Life Works in

3710.339 --> 3713.119
any scale

3713.24 --> 3716.839
centralized design

3717.0 --> 3723.66
with very elaborate workings and

3719.7 --> 3727.0789999999997
adaptation even to the micro level way

3723.66 --> 3729.7799999999997
outside of our reach of understanding

3727.079 --> 3731.099
but the nature is clear it had to be One

3729.78 --> 3734.539
Singular design

3731.099 --> 3737.6400000000003
an entropy only worsens the design

3734.539 --> 3739.8590000000004
mutations don't improve anything they

3737.64 --> 3742.859
only make things worse

3739.859 --> 3745.2599999999998
they make things tougher

3742.859 --> 3748.38
and they damage

3745.26 --> 3749.8190000000004
the design in a very specific notable

3748.38 --> 3752.76
way

3749.819 --> 3754.38
erratic thinking thoughts lack of

3752.76 --> 3758.099
feeling

3754.38 --> 3761.1600000000003
lack of ability to procreate these are

3758.099 --> 3767.46
the traits that come out of mutation

3761.16 --> 3767.46
not Evolution never Evolution never

3771.119 --> 3776.1600000000003
so we are not Apes no we're not Apes

3773.4 --> 3781.099
we're just about as much Apes as we are

3776.16 --> 3781.0989999999997
worms it's complete [Â __Â ]

3795.539 --> 3802.94
but our realm Swirls and [Â __Â ] that's

3798.96 --> 3802.94
quite a huge claim to make

3805.079 --> 3808.3390000000004
so you can start now

3810.18 --> 3815.2799999999997
it's very simple if there is a giant

3813.119 --> 3816.9
civilization with monolithic rock

3815.28 --> 3819.6600000000003
formations

3816.9 --> 3822.7200000000003
buildings giant architecture

3819.66 --> 3827.0589999999997
you can't destroy that you can't unless

3822.72 --> 3827.0589999999997
it's like completely disintegrated

3828.9 --> 3835.14
like what has been reimagined as for

3831.66 --> 3836.7
example a nuclear destructive event like

3835.14 --> 3838.2599999999998
it would have to be completely

3836.7 --> 3841.319
disintegrated

3838.26 --> 3843.7990000000004
like melting it would even get rid of

3841.319 --> 3843.799
the proof

3848.7 --> 3854.7599999999998
either there is a buried sunken city

3851.76 --> 3860.1600000000003
somewhere that's Atlantis and we would

3854.76 --> 3861.6600000000003
find it very quickly very quickly or it

3860.16 --> 3863.46
isn't

3861.66 --> 3865.859
and it's kind of more like a

3863.46 --> 3868.88
philosophical thing

3865.859 --> 3868.88
not literal

3876.9 --> 3881.2200000000003
so either the remnants of the city are

3879.359 --> 3884.88
there

3881.22 --> 3887.64
or it's been completely destroyed

3884.88 --> 3889.619
and then there's no way to ever prove it

3887.64 --> 3892.0789999999997
ever again it's just like yeah that

3889.619 --> 3894.7200000000003
Creator was once this and that oh really

3892.079 --> 3896.3390000000004
well there's no remnants of it it's just

3894.72 --> 3899.0589999999997
a giant crater

3896.339 --> 3899.0589999999997
that's it

3910.2 --> 3916.02
micro like adapt no but adaptation can

3913.74 --> 3916.9799999999996
reach pretty far with some creature's

3916.02 --> 3920.359
clutch

3916.98 --> 3924.42
but the thing is the adaptation

3920.359 --> 3929.0389999999998
is inherent to the design

3924.42 --> 3931.619
it's designed to adapt you see

3929.039 --> 3934.559
and it has a range of possible

3931.619 --> 3938.119
adaptation directions

3934.559 --> 3941.52
but it can never surpass the adaptation

3938.119 --> 3944.42
limitation at some point it can not

3941.52 --> 3944.42
further adapt

3948.78 --> 3953.46
there's no unlimited adaptation

3953.76 --> 3956.7200000000003
just isn't

3982.619 --> 3986.6400000000003
what

3983.88 --> 3990.599
more evidence backing Evolution than

3986.64 --> 3993.42
gravity no no it's pretty much exactly

3990.599 --> 3995.52
the same level of evidence

3993.42 --> 3998.7200000000003
which is zero

3995.52 --> 3998.72
they're both made up

4036.559 --> 4039.92
hmm

4038.359 --> 4043.5789999999997
what

4039.92 --> 4045.98
uh Mr Jones how how does tracing back

4043.579 --> 4047.2400000000002
lineages thousands of years prove

4045.98 --> 4050.7400000000002
evolution

4047.24 --> 4050.74
it proves lineage

4052.28 --> 4058.4
how does it

4054.079 --> 4060.559
prove there is actually an increased

4058.4 --> 4065.02
ability

4060.559 --> 4065.02
which is what evolution suggests

4066.079 --> 4072.559
if evolution would be in yeah and

4069.38 --> 4075.5
somewhat legitimate then you would see

4072.559 --> 4079.539
the Improvement

4075.5 --> 4079.539
of all species over time

4080.359 --> 4085.0989999999997
and that means that they start out less

4082.88 --> 4088.52
improved

4085.099 --> 4094.119
and they don't it's exactly the opposite

4088.52 --> 4094.119
entropy causes the design to deteriorate

4095.9 --> 4099.52
we actually devolve

4102.799 --> 4110.54
all things devolve

4105.56 --> 4114.159000000001
but they can also just not devolve a lot

4110.54 --> 4114.159
and stay pure

4115.759 --> 4119.92
stay unchanged and affected

4133.819 --> 4136.0
foreign

4140.0 --> 4142.839
no

4148.46 --> 4154.819
dude you can't even date fossils fossils

4151.88 --> 4158.06
are completely useless to prove anything

4154.819 --> 4160.64
about the past completely useless

4158.06 --> 4161.719
another thing you can establish is there

4160.64 --> 4164.4800000000005
was

4161.719 --> 4167.179
this creature

4164.48 --> 4170.0599999999995
that's it

4167.179 --> 4172.52
a lot of the times though even in modern

4170.06 --> 4174.56
history it turns out like oh we thought

4172.52 --> 4176.719
this was extinct because we only had

4174.56 --> 4180.259
fossils of it but we just found one

4176.719 --> 4184.0
living it's right here so it's all

4180.259 --> 4184.0
[Â __Â ] all of it

4190.04 --> 4195.819
that's a Kent hovered argument

4192.98 --> 4195.8189999999995
so what

4206.179 --> 4211.46
do you know how to keep your genetics

4208.76 --> 4213.8
yeah don't take vaccines ever

4211.46 --> 4217.719
don't take Pharmaceutical

4213.8 --> 4217.719
chemical based drugs ever

4219.86 --> 4226.28
make sure

4221.96 --> 4229.0
you detox from the poisonous hazards you

4226.28 --> 4229.0
cannot avoid

4231.679 --> 4237.8
make sure to keep clear-headed and the

4235.58 --> 4241.64
strong spiritual tradition of keeping

4237.8 --> 4245.6
clear-headed and moral purity

4241.64 --> 4248.84
like actual moral Purity not fake moral

4245.6 --> 4250.280000000001
Purity [Â __Â ] systems

4248.84 --> 4252.02
all of that

4250.28 --> 4254.9
strengthens

4252.02 --> 4256.88
the resonance which is like the

4254.9 --> 4259.099999999999
Resonance of your body when your spirit

4256.88 --> 4262.9400000000005
resonates properly

4259.1 --> 4265.400000000001
with your body it keeps it like

4262.94 --> 4268.879999999999
unscathed

4265.4 --> 4271.04
it will literally decrease entropy if

4268.88 --> 4274.1
you constantly take poisons

4271.04 --> 4276.0199999999995
all sorts because of whatever scientific

4274.1 --> 4278.0
reason you know

4276.02 --> 4280.6990000000005
yeah that's going to literally

4278.0 --> 4282.679
degenerate your genetics especially

4280.699 --> 4285.32
these new ones

4282.679 --> 4287.9
that you supposedly have to take because

4285.32 --> 4291.04
the doctor fauci told you yeah guess

4287.9 --> 4294.259999999999
what they do they literally

4291.04 --> 4295.699
degenerate you literally do that

4294.26 --> 4298.96
physically

4295.699 --> 4298.96
like permanently

4301.76 --> 4306.679
like the v's

4303.739 --> 4309.739
were supposed to all take now because of

4306.679 --> 4312.1990000000005
this scary spooky invisible Danger

4309.739 --> 4313.879999999999
that was made up in a lab

4312.199 --> 4317.12
made up

4313.88 --> 4320.78
as in not real

4317.12 --> 4324.08
yeah that literally devolved you

4320.78 --> 4327.219
enhances entropy causes your original

4324.08 --> 4329.42
powers inherent in your system

4327.219 --> 4332.179
concealed to you because your

4329.42 --> 4334.88
Consciousness is just not ready to deal

4332.179 --> 4337.46
with it but your kids might be or

4334.88 --> 4340.219
because you take that [Â __Â ] now you've

4337.46 --> 4342.14
literally damaged the unrevealed

4340.219 --> 4344.6
infrastructure

4342.14 --> 4347.0
of your genetic capacity Your Design

4344.6 --> 4350.120000000001
abilities that are inherent dormant

4347.0 --> 4353.659
inside of you that will pass on to

4350.12 --> 4357.4
Children yeah those things are damaged

4353.659 --> 4357.4
because of this do you understand

4359.6 --> 4364.76
now you don't devolve back into fish you

4362.719 --> 4368.84
just die out

4364.76 --> 4371.42
you become incompetent weak broken

4368.84 --> 4375.4400000000005
unable to grasp

4371.42 --> 4377.6
things yeah it that's devolving that

4375.44 --> 4380.96
doesn't mean changing back into another

4377.6 --> 4384.88
species idiot it means it degenerates

4380.96 --> 4384.88
you and your offspring

4386.659 --> 4391.219
it's like turning into Orcs right

4389.0 --> 4393.38
remember that story from Lord of the

4391.219 --> 4394.82
Rings the Orcs they were originally

4393.38 --> 4399.219
elves

4394.82 --> 4399.219
broken and mutilated

4400.52 --> 4404.5
that's what that is

4438.679 --> 4444.679
wow

4441.38 --> 4447.4400000000005
Mr Jones you don't believe in that you

4444.679 --> 4450.02
have absolutely not even a hint of a

4447.44 --> 4451.04
right to speak as to what a designer

4450.02 --> 4453.64
would do

4451.04 --> 4453.64
ass

4455.84 --> 4460.6
like

4458.06 --> 4460.6
yeah

4461.84 --> 4464.8
you don't understand

4464.9 --> 4470.659
what the designer would do you have no

4467.54 --> 4473.3
idea what's going on

4470.659 --> 4475.719
neither do I yeah I do because I pay

4473.3 --> 4475.719
attention

4476.06 --> 4480.52
I pay attention to actual Design

4478.34 --> 4483.92
Elements and natural consequences

4480.52 --> 4486.679
existential implications yes I do yes I

4483.92 --> 4488.6
do and I've already explained those

4486.679 --> 4491.62
things that I see

4488.6 --> 4491.620000000001
yes I do

4491.78 --> 4497.9
and I am personally like a World Builder

4496.46 --> 4501.44
virtually

4497.9 --> 4503.9
I spent quite a bit of time trying to

4501.44 --> 4506.0
simulate

4503.9 --> 4508.78
things

4506.0 --> 4508.78
worlds

4511.219 --> 4515.4800000000005
you've never conversed with the desire

4514.219 --> 4516.9800000000005
what

4515.48 --> 4519.94
oh really

4516.98 --> 4519.94
how would you know

4521.179 --> 4526.34
I mean the designer is the source of all

4523.82 --> 4528.739
information he talks to us all the time

4526.34 --> 4531.4400000000005
how the [Â __Â ] would you know

4528.739 --> 4535.718999999999
you don't believe anything you think it

4531.44 --> 4535.719
thinks just randomly pop into your head

4536.78 --> 4541.28
you don't even believe

4539.0 --> 4544.04
the Consciousness is a separate thing

4541.28 --> 4546.739
it's just an illusion created by the the

4544.04 --> 4549.8
mush in your brain

4546.739 --> 4552.32
to drive you

4549.8 --> 4554.4800000000005
to drive you because you think you're

4552.32 --> 4555.5599999999995
really an individual that's what you

4554.48 --> 4558.139999999999
think

4555.56 --> 4560.54
as a materialist that doesn't believe in

4558.14 --> 4561.9800000000005
a designer you don't know what the [Â __Â ]

4560.54 --> 4565.84
you're talking about

4561.98 --> 4569.718999999999
you can't just quickly adopt

4565.84 --> 4573.08
designer based elements in your

4569.719 --> 4575.06
atheistic materialistic world view that

4573.08 --> 4577.82
doesn't match there's no more origin

4575.06 --> 4582.400000000001
point for those aspects

4577.82 --> 4582.4
in your philosophical setup Mr Jones

4588.62 --> 4594.14
wooden designer he does he does all the

4591.26 --> 4596.780000000001
time you know what what happens they

4594.14 --> 4600.56
don't listen the designer talks to

4596.78 --> 4604.12
everyone all the time non-stop from

4600.56 --> 4608.06
birth constantly always all information

4604.12 --> 4611.84
comes from God all of it all ideas come

4608.06 --> 4614.860000000001
from God now if you don't listen or you

4611.84 --> 4618.860000000001
get distracted by your Earthly

4614.86 --> 4621.679
egotistical obsessions yeah that you're

4618.86 --> 4624.0199999999995
not gonna listen to what is being told

4621.679 --> 4627.14
to you you don't pay attention because

4624.02 --> 4631.219
you don't care you just want to feed

4627.14 --> 4635.12
your impulses you just want to Revel

4631.219 --> 4637.2390000000005
in some temporary pleasure or Joy or

4635.12 --> 4637.239
whatever

4638.179 --> 4642.86
just because you don't listen or you've

4640.64 --> 4644.54
forgotten how to doesn't mean

4642.86 --> 4647.739
that he doesn't talk to everybody

4644.54 --> 4647.739
because he does

4660.32 --> 4665.84
so where does the oh

4662.54 --> 4667.699
well why didn't you ask him

4665.84 --> 4670.52
right

4667.699 --> 4672.799999999999
it's all a challenge you don't even see

4670.52 --> 4675.4400000000005
that you don't like

4672.8 --> 4676.52
you you shouldn't even need to ask that

4675.44 --> 4680.36
question

4676.52 --> 4682.6990000000005
it's such a kitty [Â __Â ] question Mr Jones

4680.36 --> 4684.86
why does this designer viewers allow us

4682.699 --> 4688.5199999999995
to be born sick than command us to be

4684.86 --> 4690.679
well yeah it's called a challenge

4688.52 --> 4694.34
and if you actually take up that

4690.679 --> 4697.88
challenge then even if you are weakened

4694.34 --> 4700.12
if you seem to start out with less in

4697.88 --> 4702.76
this world compared to others

4700.12 --> 4706.599999999999
you per design

4702.76 --> 4710.0
by that decision with the grace of God

4706.6 --> 4713.659000000001
will ascend

4710.0 --> 4717.8
the sickness will Ascend the seeming

4713.659 --> 4719.9
penalty and actually show that it's not

4717.8 --> 4721.46
a consequence it's just a mental

4719.9 --> 4723.86
obstacle that you thought you couldn't

4721.46 --> 4725.84
get past that you thought you would be

4723.86 --> 4729.08
less because of

4725.84 --> 4731.9800000000005
when in the end you're more

4729.08 --> 4731.98
with it

4732.199 --> 4736.339999999999
and that's yeah it's very tough for

4734.36 --> 4739.0
people that don't even believe in God to

4736.34 --> 4739.0
realize that

4743.48 --> 4750.379999999999
right like why the wars oh why would God

4747.14 --> 4752.6
allow of Wars yeah

4750.38 --> 4754.46
because it's a challenge

4752.6 --> 4757.64
what you think you can just get

4754.46 --> 4760.219
everything all because God Is Only God

4757.64 --> 4762.38
the God is this and that and oh that

4760.219 --> 4764.179
means it's all Injustice because there's

4762.38 --> 4765.92
Injustice in the world why are people

4764.179 --> 4769.159
evil

4765.92 --> 4771.14
yeah because life is a challenge

4769.159 --> 4773.239
and if you just think that you could

4771.14 --> 4776.360000000001
just get Paradise

4773.239 --> 4778.28
out of nowhere think again that's not

4776.36 --> 4781.219
what this is

4778.28 --> 4784.759999999999
you gotta take the challenge you gotta

4781.219 --> 4787.46
decide to be better to grow

4784.76 --> 4790.76
in the face of the challenge to overcome

4787.46 --> 4792.62
the challenge and to ascend Beyond The

4790.76 --> 4796.219
Challenge

4792.62 --> 4799.42
and that requires [Â __Â ] out there that

4796.219 --> 4802.58
requires tests

4799.42 --> 4803.9
Devils that test your patience that

4802.58 --> 4806.659
discourage you

4803.9 --> 4809.0599999999995
that get in your way that steal from you

4806.659 --> 4811.28
that trick you

4809.06 --> 4813.620000000001
it's all part of the challenge

4811.28 --> 4815.719
yeah

4813.62 --> 4819.58
if you don't get that

4815.719 --> 4819.58
then you're just weak

4820.639 --> 4826.58
you're just weak empathetic

4823.76 --> 4830.38
and you don't have any human courage you

4826.58 --> 4830.38
don't have any spirit

4833.78 --> 4838.94
because you're just like oh why does

4836.719 --> 4842.12
evil exist it shouldn't exist this is

4838.94 --> 4843.98
unfair no you're just weak

4842.12 --> 4846.62
you're weak you don't even understand

4843.98 --> 4850.178999999999
what it is you don't understand evil you

4846.62 --> 4850.179
don't understand why it's there

4850.28 --> 4856.28
what it is how it works how it comes

4853.46 --> 4859.34
into being you don't understand any of

4856.28 --> 4861.62
that you don't even ask the question

4859.34 --> 4866.7390000000005
because you're outraged because God

4861.62 --> 4866.739
allowed terrible things to manifest

4874.46 --> 4880.4
yeah God allows people

4878.0 --> 4881.84
to allow terrible things to manifest

4880.4 --> 4882.739
that's right it's called freedom of

4881.84 --> 4885.82
choice

4882.739 --> 4888.08
it's an integral key part to the design

4885.82 --> 4891.94
and if you don't want to deal with it

4888.08 --> 4891.94
then you are a slave

4899.6 --> 4901.84
foreign

4907.36 --> 4913.159
just being Chanty whiners now I'm done

4910.82 --> 4916.4
with this I've already made

4913.159 --> 4918.62
true enough statements you two just

4916.4 --> 4921.199
take a time out

4918.62 --> 4924.739
it's a bunch of whining atheist pieces

4921.199 --> 4924.739
of [Â __Â ] whining

4949.4 --> 4953.96
I don't know the craziest thing that God

4951.739 --> 4958.28
is speaking to them no God speaks to

4953.96 --> 4962.199
everyone all the time non-stop he's

4958.28 --> 4962.199
always there the information is there

4962.659 --> 4966.98
only thing you have to do is not ignore

4966.08 --> 4969.44
it

4966.98 --> 4972.099999999999
not look away

4969.44 --> 4973.879999999999
not be less

4972.1 --> 4975.4400000000005
embrace

4973.88 --> 4978.5
the grand

4975.44 --> 4980.36
scope of the information that is ever

4978.5 --> 4983.199
available

4980.36 --> 4986.799999999999
inside you don't have to go anywhere

4983.199 --> 4986.799999999999
it's just there

4995.06 --> 5000.280000000001
laugh it up you stupid [Â __Â ] get the

4997.639 --> 5004.9800000000005
[Â __Â ] out you atheist scumbag

5000.28 --> 5004.98
yeah I said it atheist scumbag

5005.679 --> 5010.42
it's what they all turn into I mean you

5008.26 --> 5012.400000000001
can have your doubts about God or the

5010.42 --> 5014.86
nature of the design and all that and be

5012.4 --> 5017.86
like yeah I'm not entirely sure

5014.86 --> 5021.339999999999
but the real atheist always do it

5017.86 --> 5022.839999999999
because they want the freedom to be a

5021.34 --> 5025.2390000000005
piece of [Â __Â ]

5022.84 --> 5027.34
without consequences

5025.239 --> 5029.08
right now they can't have that there

5027.34 --> 5033.76
will always be consequences but they

5029.08 --> 5036.1
want to believe it has no consequences

5033.76 --> 5039.219
and that's why they turn into demonic

5036.1 --> 5041.4400000000005
pieces as [Â __Â ] they're just lying

5039.219 --> 5045.42
being disgusting

5041.44 --> 5045.419999999999
and get banned here

5067.48 --> 5072.94
men gave urge to Africa it doesn't exist

5071.02 --> 5075.719
age doesn't exist

5072.94 --> 5075.719
what's the condition

5086.02 --> 5091.900000000001
right so anybody's still out there

5089.26 --> 5095.56
these stupid atheists were spamming my

5091.9 --> 5098.138999999999
uh my chat was getting annoying

5095.56 --> 5100.179
I prefer to get you guys back because

5098.139 --> 5102.82
you were having great discussions before

5100.179 --> 5105.2390000000005
they started dropping all that [Â __Â ] in

5102.82 --> 5105.239
my chat

5110.139 --> 5113.139
foreign

5141.159 --> 5144.638999999999
if not I'm going to round out the show

5143.139 --> 5146.8
right now

5144.639 --> 5149.1990000000005
right now

5146.8 --> 5150.400000000001
you got one minute people speak up in my

5149.199 --> 5152.739
chat

5150.4 --> 5155.699
or I'm rounding out the show right now
