390.72 --> 395.03900000000004
oh yeah of course made by jimbo

392.88 --> 397.6
relativism is dumb

395.039 --> 400.56

397.6 --> 403.03900000000004
getting all active in chat

400.56 --> 403.039
what's that

404.319 --> 409.36
wait

405.759 --> 411.12
maybe that's that was still saturday

409.36 --> 413.039
doesn't

411.12 --> 415.36
yeah that was still saturday never mind

413.039 --> 415.36
uh

420.84 --> 426.08
right there's an oakley's premiere of

423.759 --> 426.08000000000004
course

432.4 --> 436.96
right what was i watching yesterday oh

434.479 --> 439.75899999999996
yeah i remember again

436.96 --> 440.79999999999995
yeah i uh went back to netflix and i

439.759 --> 444.16
watched

440.8 --> 446.639
the first movie that daddy's

444.16 --> 447.91900000000004
home i think it's called

446.639 --> 450.639
yeah

447.919 --> 453.12
but i do the first one was like really

450.639 --> 455.28000000000003
annoying actually

453.12 --> 457.52
it's funny because i vaguely remember

455.28 --> 460.31899999999996
that owen benjamin made a reference to

457.52 --> 462.0
it as well like he saw the first movie

460.319 --> 465.199
first time and he thought it was super

462.0 --> 467.599
gamma and it is it is like

465.199 --> 469.52000000000004
just a gamma off

467.599 --> 471.759
terrible

469.52 --> 474.24
and but yes i watched the second one

471.759 --> 475.599
first so i didn't have that backdrop

474.24 --> 477.039
idea

475.599 --> 479.52
and they're kind of different in the

477.039 --> 481.68
second movie much more tolerable and

479.52 --> 484.15999999999997
much more just about dead sun

481.68 --> 486.8
relationships and all that

484.16 --> 488.72
in the first one one it wasn't like

486.8 --> 490.96000000000004
the grandpas weren't involved in that

488.72 --> 493.84000000000003
one and it was just a gamma off

490.96 --> 493.84
constantly

499.84 --> 505.35999999999996
harwin would squeak no thanks get it

502.16 --> 505.36
inspector no

505.44 --> 509.52
now everybody else has already watched

507.28 --> 509.52
that

510.08 --> 515.159
and i i kind of know what it's about you

512.159 --> 517.76
know like when we get super popular like

515.159 --> 521.76
everybody makes their reviews and their

517.76 --> 525.2
comparison and their smart analysis and

521.76 --> 528.48
i already know enough about squid games

525.2 --> 530.72
i mean maybe at some point

528.48 --> 532.08
i will kind of watch it when i'm like

530.72 --> 534.24
really in the mood for something

532.08 --> 535.76
hardcore or something i don't know i

534.24 --> 538.48
don't see it yet

535.76 --> 540.64
not not in this period of time

538.48 --> 543.6
maybe after the ancestral winds have

540.64 --> 543.6
retracted again

543.68 --> 549.0799999999999
it's just way too dark

546.08 --> 549.08
uh

556.48 --> 562.6
try thinking short video about ranty oh

559.6 --> 562.6
okay

566.32 --> 569.44
nearly christmas

572.32 --> 576.6800000000001
it's just a little over a month away

578.32 --> 582.0
no no we got you inspect that's the

580.0 --> 586.36
whole point i don't really want to watch

582.0 --> 586.36
something hardcore right now

590.959 --> 595.8389999999999
like there's a already so much just

594.16 --> 597.6
hearts and

595.839 --> 599.519
hard stuff out there

597.6 --> 603.399
from hollywood like i

599.519 --> 603.399
i'm not in the mood

608.24 --> 610.64
anyway

613.279 --> 615.6
uh

616.959 --> 623.3199999999999
didn't already rush through everything

619.839 --> 623.32
i think i did

638.48 --> 642.72
all right yeah

640.399 --> 646.2
noticed an arty

642.72 --> 646.2
silly article

646.399 --> 651.76
the iss

648.72 --> 654.0790000000001
crew were told to hide because of the

651.76 --> 658.079
high risk of space debris immediately

654.079 --> 661.2399999999999
reminded me about geosci shifter song

658.079 --> 661.2399999999999
of course

674.0 --> 676.32
right

684.32 --> 687.519
so yeah i thought that yesterday's show

686.079 --> 689.8389999999999
was pretty good

687.519 --> 693.04
i didn't watch it back but it just

689.839 --> 696.0
everything went pretty smoothly

693.04 --> 697.279
i hope to kind of keep up that level

696.0 --> 701.72
keep going

697.279 --> 701.72
no more silent pauses like

702.959 --> 706.399
when i

704.399 --> 707.92
when that doesn't happen because when

706.399 --> 710.0
they're silent pause there's all kinds

707.92 --> 711.12
of weird internal chemistry happening

710.0 --> 713.04
with me

711.12 --> 715.12
pondering on things like trying to get a

713.04 --> 718.079
certain feeling tension under control or

715.12 --> 720.72
something to move on

718.079 --> 721.8389999999999
but it is kind of disruptive like in the

720.72 --> 722.639
screen

721.839 --> 725.519
so

722.639 --> 727.6800000000001
i've been able to keep that out

725.519 --> 732.72
and it's good it's much better my show

727.68 --> 732.7199999999999
is much more better to watch that way

733.12 --> 738.72
i'm working on it

735.839 --> 742.36
hide where yeah i know right bree

738.72 --> 742.36
hello by the way

747.04 --> 750.7199999999999
i don't know maybe maybe they have like

748.639 --> 750.72
a

752.72 --> 756.9590000000001
you call that

753.92 --> 758.7199999999999
a safe house a safe room like a pod

756.959 --> 760.7199999999999
that's extra armored or something i

758.72 --> 761.839
don't know that's complete nonsense by

760.72 --> 764.0
the way

761.839 --> 764.0
but

764.399 --> 768.399
that whole article didn't make a lot of

766.079 --> 768.399
sense

768.48 --> 771.9590000000001
but it is hilarious

783.12 --> 788.48
yes gadget inspector i heard of that i

785.279 --> 788.48
mentioned it yesterday

788.56 --> 791.68
i think i did anyway

792.399 --> 795.72
it's crazy

800.0 --> 804.56
mean they're trying something like the

801.68 --> 806.0
end here too they call it the the 2g

804.56 --> 808.079
policy

806.0 --> 810.48
and months ago everybody voted against

808.079 --> 812.6389999999999
it and now suddenly everybody voted the

810.48 --> 814.48
same people

812.639 --> 817.2
voted for it

814.48 --> 819.839
like in our congress

817.2 --> 821.1990000000001
and everybody's like really upset over

819.839 --> 824.8000000000001
it

821.199 --> 827.12
and they should be because this is just

824.8 --> 830.3199999999999
uniformly against like

827.12 --> 832.48
the most fundamental

830.32 --> 834.48
principles from the netherlands that

832.48 --> 836.32
everybody in their mind has been like

834.48 --> 838.5600000000001
championing for so long and that's that

836.32 --> 841.0400000000001
freedom and

838.56 --> 843.5189999999999
like even being all super leftist like

841.04 --> 846.3199999999999
they're not they shouldn't be agreeing

843.519 --> 849.519
to that and a lot don't

846.32 --> 852.0
the ones that even still think that

849.519 --> 854.24
all this

852.0 --> 856.16
like left super left wing and oh

854.24 --> 858.5600000000001
everybody's gay and all that like a lot

856.16 --> 863.04
of people even here don't agree

858.56 --> 864.88
with this [ __ ] with this crazy

863.04 --> 868.3199999999999
v passport

864.88 --> 868.32
and all that and now

868.639 --> 871.639
discriminatory

872.16 --> 876.24
treatment of people that are envied

876.639 --> 879.199
so yeah

877.839 --> 882.839
i

879.199 --> 882.8389999999999
we'll see what happens

884.32 --> 889.6800000000001
i don't think they have any stable legal

886.399 --> 889.68
grounds to do it anyway

890.48 --> 896.04
over here at least

892.0 --> 896.04
i don't know about other countries

898.079 --> 902.88
retreat to their spaceships really low

906.079 --> 912.2399999999999
all right i didn't like detail read it

909.76 --> 913.76
it's just one page of text and

912.24 --> 916.0
it's kind of disappointed they didn't

913.76 --> 916.0
even

916.399 --> 922.24
show anything other than a photograph of

918.639 --> 922.24
the iss that's it

922.639 --> 928.399
it's just a silly story somebody made up

925.36 --> 930.16
as a busy therapy i think

928.399 --> 932.88
to keep you thinking about space

930.16 --> 932.88
concepts

934.32 --> 939.639
like a little bedtime story

936.639 --> 939.639
anyway

952.959 --> 958.8
seen gerund show

956.0 --> 962.0
confusing compared to mitchell fe school

958.8 --> 962.0
yeah but mitchell is

962.959 --> 969.4399999999999
like mitchell's school is actually

966.16 --> 972.079
much more like a school like he really

969.44 --> 974.1600000000001
sticks to the topics

972.079 --> 976.2399999999999
and like recycles it over and over again

974.16 --> 979.92
it's really aimed at newbies and like

976.24 --> 979.92
even at young people

981.839 --> 987.1990000000001
it's a very kid-friendly show

984.48 --> 990.72
right and jaron is just he's a like a

987.199 --> 994.5999999999999
flat earth veteran so he is

990.72 --> 994.6
not doing it like that

1003.759 --> 1007.1990000000001
whatever i don't need it

1008.8 --> 1011.8
yuck

1036.079 --> 1040.1599999999999
hey america silver patriot good to see

1038.0 --> 1040.16
you

1047.039 --> 1051.28
right but if you're all talking about

1049.2 --> 1053.52
confusing gerund stream i don't know i

1051.28 --> 1057.44
haven't seen it normally i don't really

1053.52 --> 1057.44
find his dreams confusing at all

1060.24 --> 1066.84
do you think mitchell and jiren should

1062.4 --> 1066.8400000000001
write fe scientific textbooks

1072.48 --> 1078.0
scientific it's a bit difficult really

1074.96 --> 1081.3600000000001
to call it like that but yeah they could

1078.0 --> 1082.799
if they have the ambition to if they

1081.36 --> 1084.32
right

1082.799 --> 1086.24
like

1084.32 --> 1089.039
that sort of thing is doable there's

1086.24 --> 1091.679
people out there doing such things like

1089.039 --> 1093.12
owen benjamin i follow been following

1091.679 --> 1096.24
him for a while

1093.12 --> 1097.52
and like bears send him

1096.24 --> 1100.4
books

1097.52 --> 1102.8799999999999
that they made like children's books

1100.4 --> 1105.3600000000001
like with bear themed children stories

1102.88 --> 1107.2800000000002
for example so yeah you could do that

1105.36 --> 1112.8799999999999
right

1107.28 --> 1112.8799999999999
if you got a vision if you know how to

1114.0 --> 1118.88
make a a good textbook about that

1117.039 --> 1122.32
pictures and all that

1118.88 --> 1124.48
yeah they could do it

1122.32 --> 1126.24
now anybody could technically do it i

1124.48 --> 1128.08
don't know maybe there's already some of

1126.24 --> 1128.96
those out there it all depends though of

1128.08 --> 1130.72
course

1128.96 --> 1133.919
like what type of arguments are they

1130.72 --> 1133.919
gonna insert if they're like

1134.72 --> 1138.559
like eric dubay books i bet that he has

1137.44 --> 1141.039
some books

1138.559 --> 1141.039
by now

1141.6 --> 1146.6399999999999
but they're gonna have like his typical

1144.32 --> 1149.28
arguments that are like

1146.64 --> 1152.24
the immediate assumption of an ice ring

1149.28 --> 1156.3999999999999
all those things right the more

1152.24 --> 1156.4
flurry general arguments

1158.4 --> 1164.5590000000002
but yeah i don't yeah it's better to

1160.559 --> 1167.6
kind of like keep it

1164.559 --> 1170.32
purely technical and

1167.6 --> 1171.84
well physics oriented

1170.32 --> 1175.6789999999999
yeah what we're doing over at the flat

1171.84 --> 1176.9599999999998
earth debates and mitchell's on that too

1175.679 --> 1179.44
so yeah

1176.96 --> 1182.559
he could and so could jaron if he wanted

1179.44 --> 1182.559
to i don't know if he does

1184.32 --> 1187.36
but yeah for mitchell that would

1186.0 --> 1188.4
definitely

1187.36 --> 1190.559
work

1188.4 --> 1193.1200000000001
like in combination with this flattered

1190.559 --> 1194.16
school like if he'd work on such a book

1193.12 --> 1195.6789999999999
and then

1194.16 --> 1197.919
publish it

1195.679 --> 1201.52
then he yeah he could literally just say

1197.919 --> 1203.3600000000001
yeah you can order the book and then

1201.52 --> 1207.28
when he's discussing a subject he could

1203.36 --> 1209.9189999999999
even like say oh like yeah go to page

1207.28 --> 1211.84
seven of my book and see right there you

1209.919 --> 1213.5200000000002
have the diagram right in front of you

1211.84 --> 1216.559
and then explain them yeah that could

1213.52 --> 1218.559
work really well it's well like a school

1216.559 --> 1221.84
system like that

1218.559 --> 1221.84
if he wanted to

1224.159 --> 1226.24
and

1225.2 --> 1228.64
yeah

1226.24 --> 1232.0
if he knows how to just have to have the

1228.64 --> 1232.0
confidence etc and

1232.72 --> 1239.6000000000001
do some studying up on like how

1235.84 --> 1239.6
basic publishing like that works

1243.28 --> 1246.799
right but yeah i don't want to push that

1245.44 --> 1248.799
idea on him

1246.799 --> 1251.039
you know people have been kind of trying

1248.799 --> 1253.52
to push ideas on me as well and i don't

1251.039 --> 1256.559
really respond all that well i'm like no

1253.52 --> 1257.6
i don't want to do anything

1256.559 --> 1259.6
like

1257.6 --> 1262.08
big like that

1259.6 --> 1264.9599999999998
for me i don't i don't really like the

1262.08 --> 1267.1999999999998
idea of publishing books

1264.96 --> 1270.48
it's like whatever's gonna be in there i

1267.2 --> 1272.64
am gonna like endlessly be annoyed about

1270.48 --> 1275.64
how outdated it is

1272.64 --> 1275.64
constantly

1277.36 --> 1281.6
because i'll put down something to the

1279.52 --> 1284.72
best of my ability and then when i can

1281.6 --> 1285.76
finally be satisfied about

1284.72 --> 1288.0
it

1285.76 --> 1290.8799999999999
then like years later i'm guaranteed to

1288.0 --> 1292.799
look at it again say like damn

1290.88 --> 1295.5200000000002
why hadn't i thought of this little

1292.799 --> 1297.679
detail back then now it's everywhere

1295.52 --> 1299.44
it's wrong right i even have the same

1297.679 --> 1300.5590000000002
effect like with my old symbolics

1299.44 --> 1303.1200000000001
website

1300.559 --> 1304.799
and a lot of stuff i wrote down in there

1303.12 --> 1308.32
is really good

1304.799 --> 1308.32
but it still kind of like has

1308.72 --> 1314.48
the earth being a ball based

1312.0 --> 1316.08
mechanical ideas inserted in there as

1314.48 --> 1317.679
well and

1316.08 --> 1319.6
most people won't even pick up on that

1317.679 --> 1321.76
it's just some minor details but i it's

1319.6 --> 1324.0
like an eyesore to me now and i can't

1321.76 --> 1325.36
freaking edit it

1324.0 --> 1327.039
it's

1325.36 --> 1329.1999999999998
like

1327.039 --> 1331.44
it's just a

1329.2 --> 1333.919
a digital piece of paper that's on the

1331.44 --> 1335.76
internet i can't change it anymore

1333.919 --> 1338.4
like i would have to like

1335.76 --> 1340.799
totally remake the site and like

1338.4 --> 1343.2800000000002
extract all the data and then remake it

1340.799 --> 1346.08
it's gonna cost and or

1343.28 --> 1348.96
no it's gonna cost because i'm not a

1346.08 --> 1350.799
proper web designer

1348.96 --> 1352.72
right

1350.799 --> 1354.799
besides i kind of like just want to keep

1352.72 --> 1355.84
it the way it is because it is so old

1354.799 --> 1358.6399999999999
and i'm

1355.84 --> 1358.6399999999999
fascinated of

1358.799 --> 1364.24
that it is so old and that it even with

1361.84 --> 1368.0
my thinking back then still

1364.24 --> 1370.0
seems to work out in so many ways

1368.0 --> 1372.0
and if i just completely republish it

1370.0 --> 1373.6
i'd probably end up editing a lot and

1372.0 --> 1375.84
then it wouldn't be the same it wouldn't

1373.6 --> 1377.9189999999999
be

1375.84 --> 1380.559
the mind developments that i had back

1377.919 --> 1384.4
then not being in the know yet and that

1380.559 --> 1386.08
fascinates me right i'm fascinated by

1384.4 --> 1388.3200000000002
what comes out of you when you're not

1386.08 --> 1390.6399999999999
fully in the know yet and how it then

1388.32 --> 1393.039
connects to where you're going to be at

1390.64 --> 1393.8400000000001
in the future i'm totally fascinated by

1393.039 --> 1395.2
that

1393.84 --> 1398.0
so that's why i'm kind of like just

1395.2 --> 1399.76
keeping it the way it is my symbolics.nl

1398.0 --> 1401.6
website

1399.76 --> 1405.679
anyway

1401.6 --> 1408.3999999999999
uh but yeah if mitch was looking for

1405.679 --> 1408.4
an idea

1409.44 --> 1412.3200000000002
he could potentially even make money out

1411.36 --> 1417.08
of it

1412.32 --> 1417.08
and yeah i'm all for that

1420.0 --> 1423.919
if he could make it in a way that it's

1421.6 --> 1426.559
like really

1423.919 --> 1428.48
friendly and concise and not too feely

1426.559 --> 1430.32
feely

1428.48 --> 1433.44
then he could make it into a great

1430.32 --> 1433.4399999999998
children's learning book

1435.52 --> 1440.799
that would just work as a standalone

1438.08 --> 1442.8799999999999
learning source right

1440.799 --> 1444.559
wouldn't have to make anybody watch a

1442.88 --> 1446.96
stream even

1444.559 --> 1450.08
if it's really good it's up to him

1446.96 --> 1452.08
i wonder if he's listening

1450.08 --> 1454.72
might be a little bit early for him

1452.08 --> 1457.72
or super late rather

1454.72 --> 1457.72
anyway

1466.799 --> 1473.84
hello l

1468.72 --> 1473.84
and jeff gassett let's see you

1480.159 --> 1484.64
sharon teaches crypto classes

1482.88 --> 1486.4
yeah

1484.64 --> 1488.4
i'm not too much into that

1486.4 --> 1492.3200000000002
but karen does seem to have a pretty

1488.4 --> 1492.3200000000002
decent grip on how it all works

1494.88 --> 1499.44
i don't

1496.24 --> 1501.84
i mean i have like a very preliminary

1499.44 --> 1501.8400000000001
insight

1502.96 --> 1508.64
realizing that yeah it's basically just

1505.44 --> 1511.039
kind of another trade

1508.64 --> 1511.039
system

1511.36 --> 1515.84
like well stock market trading but

1513.679 --> 1518.799
different it is different but it is

1515.84 --> 1520.799
effectively a trading system

1518.799 --> 1522.96
and if you're good at that like no one

1520.799 --> 1527.1589999999999
went to buy went to sell yeah then you

1522.96 --> 1527.159
could be really good at it

1528.559 --> 1532.3999999999999
10 p.m for mitch oh right

1533.44 --> 1537.24
i don't know what he's doing

1556.64 --> 1560.5590000000002
what

1557.52 --> 1562.4
okay so in the philippines all the

1560.559 --> 1567.559
schools are closed

1562.4 --> 1567.5590000000002
for like five months that is insane

1581.44 --> 1586.48
all right anyway

1583.76 --> 1586.48
oh since

1586.88 --> 1592.0
wow you really screwed up that sentence

1589.76 --> 1592.0
uh

1593.2 --> 1595.52
what

1596.4 --> 1601.1200000000001
so like almost one and a half year that

1599.76 --> 1602.08
is

1601.12 --> 1605.4399999999998
like

1602.08 --> 1608.08
what are they doing you know that time

1605.44 --> 1610.72
like are the parents homeschooling

1608.08 --> 1610.72
like are they

1610.84 --> 1615.4399999999998
like is that just like outside of school

1614.32 --> 1618.6399999999999
teachers

1615.44 --> 1620.3200000000002
that like go buy houses and just teach

1618.64 --> 1622.3200000000002
groups of kids like what's going on

1620.32 --> 1625.32
there then that's like a really long

1622.32 --> 1625.32
time

1634.4 --> 1637.5590000000002
all right

1648.72 --> 1655.2
earth is fluffy today is it

1651.52 --> 1656.08
psychics traveler hello it is

1655.2 --> 1660.24
if

1656.08 --> 1660.24
yeah sort of well yeah

1660.399 --> 1665.039
it's not going to be good for the kids

1662.799 --> 1665.039
like

1665.679 --> 1671.159
like they need to learn how to socialize

1667.76 --> 1671.1589999999999
at that age

1682.88 --> 1687.3600000000001
all right been getting distracted on

1684.88 --> 1690.0
youtube lately by

1687.36 --> 1690.0
this guy

1691.44 --> 1695.44
as a channel purely dedicated

1695.52 --> 1700.08
to like making

1697.919 --> 1702.3200000000002
terrariums

1700.08 --> 1705.76
but he's like he plastics it up all the

1702.32 --> 1705.76
time and all that but

1708.08 --> 1711.84
like that guy's made some impressive

1709.919 --> 1713.2
things and it's it's

1711.84 --> 1716.0
yeah it's art

1713.2 --> 1718.559
and it's nature a bit

1716.0 --> 1720.399
it just it kept bumping into him and so

1718.559 --> 1722.559
i just watched some and it's really

1720.399 --> 1724.399
entertaining but it yeah it doesn't

1722.559 --> 1728.1589999999999
really relate to anything oh yes it's

1724.399 --> 1731.6
this channel's serpa design

1728.159 --> 1733.7600000000002
it's a pretty big channel not super fast

1731.6 --> 1733.76
but

1736.88 --> 1743.8400000000001
like great background props like this

1740.32 --> 1746.96
guys could also like be

1743.84 --> 1747.76
a guy like on a studio set from a movie

1746.96 --> 1749.52
like

1747.76 --> 1752.1589999999999
arranging

1749.52 --> 1754.1589999999999
a fake jungle that looks really real

1752.159 --> 1755.919
like i bet he could do that

1754.159 --> 1757.679
maybe he has done something like that in

1755.919 --> 1758.96
the past

1757.679 --> 1763.0800000000002
anyway

1758.96 --> 1763.08
doesn't really relate to anything

1771.6 --> 1776.12
i'll

1772.48 --> 1776.1200000000001
show you the channel

1784.0 --> 1787.0
okay

1796.0 --> 1803.0
right so at least this guy is going to

1797.84 --> 1803.0
be able to keep himself busy you know

1808.159 --> 1813.3600000000001
i wonder if he's like a vax taker

1810.96 --> 1816.0
he doesn't look like extraordinarily

1813.36 --> 1817.76
healthy or anything but he's yeah he's

1816.0 --> 1820.76
still very good in what he does in the

1817.76 --> 1820.76
videos

1825.2 --> 1829.6000000000001
i bet he has a lot of

1827.039 --> 1829.6
business

1830.799 --> 1833.799
anyway

1845.84 --> 1853.559
wow close terrarium for 70 years wow

1850.0 --> 1853.559
yeah that's incredible

1867.2 --> 1872.24
all right but yeah if you check out

1868.96 --> 1876.24
the video that i just posted of him

1872.24 --> 1881.039
you'll realize like this guy would be

1876.24 --> 1881.039
really good probably at making like

1881.519 --> 1888.32
rooms for even animals

1885.679 --> 1888.3200000000002
like in

1888.88 --> 1894.5590000000002
in zoos right you know sometimes you

1890.799 --> 1897.2
have a zoo that has like an inside place

1894.559 --> 1899.76
and then like with glass cages pretty

1897.2 --> 1902.24
much and like lots of plants usually for

1899.76 --> 1904.84
like lizards and snakes

1902.24 --> 1908.24
well i bet he'd be very good at

1904.84 --> 1910.9599999999998
making like making those types of places

1908.24 --> 1912.88
look really beautiful and still be

1910.96 --> 1914.08
good for the creature

1912.88 --> 1916.72
i don't know

1914.08 --> 1919.36
maybe i'm connecting too much

1916.72 --> 1922.96
it just reminded me a lot about that

1919.36 --> 1922.9599999999998
habitats that's the word yes

1929.919 --> 1932.919
anyway

1935.6 --> 1940.399
right i bet like watching that stuff

1937.919 --> 1942.64
makes certain people very in a very

1940.399 --> 1945.6
creative mood because there's people out

1942.64 --> 1949.8400000000001
there that do this sort of thing for

1945.6 --> 1949.84
christmas decorations right

1950.159 --> 1955.7600000000002
if you just see this guy build stuff and

1952.32 --> 1957.36
props and like plants thingies

1955.76 --> 1960.0
then some people are probably gonna be

1957.36 --> 1962.7199999999998
inspired like oh yeah make like

1960.0 --> 1966.799
christmas thingies

1962.72 --> 1966.799
i don't even know what you call them but

1967.039 --> 1970.32
you probably know what i mean

1973.84 --> 1977.24
hello crockett

1989.36 --> 1993.1999999999998
what

1990.72 --> 1994.159
you can reflect the light

1993.2 --> 1995.44
and

1994.159 --> 1997.519
even

1995.44 --> 2000.519
have sunset

1997.519 --> 2000.519
okay

2013.36 --> 2018.4799999999998
that's by the way kind of interesting

2016.72 --> 2020.48
now that you mention it in a terrarium

2018.48 --> 2021.84
yeah i got a whole different idea from

2020.48 --> 2025.2
what you just said

2021.84 --> 2025.1999999999998
you got a point though with that

2025.44 --> 2031.2
could you

2027.44 --> 2034.799
is it would it be technically possible

2031.2 --> 2037.8400000000001
to reflect sunlight

2034.799 --> 2040.799
in a daytime region

2037.84 --> 2040.799
with mirrors

2042.96 --> 2048.8
and make the daylight visible in a

2046.08 --> 2051.44
nighttime region that way is that

2048.8 --> 2051.44
possible

2056.32 --> 2061.76
right now if you believe

2059.52 --> 2064.8
that the sun

2061.76 --> 2066.3990000000003
is actually an object in somewhere in a

2064.8 --> 2068.48
vast distance

2066.399 --> 2070.48
shining light all the way and then you

2068.48 --> 2073.2
must also accept

2070.48 --> 2075.679
by accepting that model that well light

2073.2 --> 2079.1189999999997
is able to travel incredible distances

2075.679 --> 2080.48
and still be very very visible right

2079.119 --> 2082.32
so

2080.48 --> 2084.079
the only thing that could stop the light

2082.32 --> 2085.9190000000003
from reaching you is a geometric

2084.079 --> 2088.639
obstruction

2085.919 --> 2092.0
but what if you used mirrors

2088.639 --> 2094.3990000000003
to basically reflect sunlight

2092.0 --> 2096.72
in daytime region

2094.399 --> 2098.4
and yeah basically reflect it all the

2096.72 --> 2100.16
way

2098.4 --> 2102.8
to a part

2100.16 --> 2105.839
where it is in daylight would you still

2102.8 --> 2108.88
see it could you literally see the

2105.839 --> 2112.16
sunlight through a mirror system

2108.88 --> 2112.1600000000003
at a nighttime region

2114.4 --> 2119.119
right this is a question also because i

2117.359 --> 2121.5989999999997
am assuming in my

2119.119 --> 2123.52
personal modeling that the sun is purely

2121.599 --> 2125.52
a holographic phenomenon

2123.52 --> 2128.079
and then that becomes very mysterious

2125.52 --> 2129.68
because if it was literally a

2128.079 --> 2133.44
a spot

2129.68 --> 2134.3999999999996
from which light emanates from that spot

2133.44 --> 2136.7200000000003
then

2134.4 --> 2138.56
if it could reach that far you should be

2136.72 --> 2140.8799999999997
able to reflect it

2138.56 --> 2142.32
because it just you could stretch the

2140.88 --> 2144.32
length over which the light has to

2142.32 --> 2145.839
travel a little further through the

2144.32 --> 2149.04
mirror system

2145.839 --> 2152.64
but if it's purely holographic

2149.04 --> 2154.48
would it even be possible

2152.64 --> 2156.4
to see

2154.48 --> 2158.56
light being reflected through a mirror

2156.4 --> 2160.88
system where you could literally just

2158.56 --> 2162.7999999999997
basically reflect the beam of the

2160.88 --> 2164.1600000000003
sunlight straight into like a tube or

2162.8 --> 2166.4
something

2164.16 --> 2168.72
mirror corrections

2166.4 --> 2172.48
would you still see it on the other side

2168.72 --> 2175.5989999999997
even though you see it go in

2172.48 --> 2177.28
where the light is actually shining

2175.599 --> 2179.599
where it's entering if you would see it

2177.28 --> 2183.079
enter going in would you still see it on

2179.599 --> 2183.079
the other side

2187.76 --> 2191.2000000000003
right

2188.88 --> 2192.48
i mean

2191.2 --> 2195.1189999999997
we can

2192.48 --> 2198.0
technically make light travel over

2195.119 --> 2201.119
pretty fast distances using

2198.0 --> 2203.28
wire remember internet wire

2201.119 --> 2205.92
the light based internet wire

2203.28 --> 2208.88
glass fiber it's called

2205.92 --> 2211.6800000000003
so if you can do that now of course they

2208.88 --> 2215.28
have to basically have pulses inserted

2211.68 --> 2218.0
and they probably have to be reinserted

2215.28 --> 2220.079
but could you

2218.0 --> 2224.4
do something similar with the sun could

2220.079 --> 2227.119
you make sunlight be visible

2224.4 --> 2230.32
in the night time

2227.119 --> 2230.32
through a mirror system

2231.839 --> 2236.32
that's the question that i came up with

2234.0 --> 2240.28
just now because of what

2236.32 --> 2240.28
psychics traveler said

2248.56 --> 2252.0
yeah

2249.839 --> 2253.839
okay seeking start yeah well that

2252.0 --> 2256.64
consideration doesn't really help

2253.839 --> 2258.4
answering that question at all

2256.64 --> 2260.96
it's more like what is it what is the

2258.4 --> 2263.6800000000003
light yeah well i'm just curious

2260.96 --> 2265.2
would it actually be reflectible to

2263.68 --> 2270.44
still be visible

2265.2 --> 2270.4399999999996
in nighttime region that's my question

2270.48 --> 2275.68
or

2271.359 --> 2277.92
would simply that sunlight not exist

2275.68 --> 2280.24
at all would it not

2277.92 --> 2283.839
be manifesting

2280.24 --> 2285.1189999999997
if you are there that you wouldn't see a

2283.839 --> 2288.0789999999997
because

2285.119 --> 2290.96
from that vantage point

2288.079 --> 2294.0
the exit of the mirror tunnel

2290.96 --> 2296.48
the sun isn't there it isn't actually in

2294.0 --> 2298.32
the right spot to be reflecting all the

2296.48 --> 2300.56
way to you so even though when you're

2298.32 --> 2302.8
standing in the daylight side of the

2300.56 --> 2302.7999999999997
tube

2302.96 --> 2307.76
the reflection tube of the sunlight you

2304.8 --> 2310.1600000000003
would see it go in because over there

2307.76 --> 2312.7200000000003
the sun is at the right angle to be

2310.16 --> 2315.52
reflecting in there but then at the

2312.72 --> 2318.64
nighttime side the exit of the tube

2315.52 --> 2321.119
from that vantage point the daylight

2318.64 --> 2322.64
isn't in the right spot to be reflecting

2321.119 --> 2325.599
all the way over there

2322.64 --> 2328.4
now that would be interesting

2325.599 --> 2330.88
it would support the holographic nature

2328.4 --> 2330.88
actually

2337.52 --> 2344.079
think about it if if you can bend your

2340.64 --> 2344.0789999999997
mind around this concept

2350.0 --> 2354.8
it's like background yeah but

2352.48 --> 2357.76
do you understand timothy p southwick

2354.8 --> 2357.76
what i'm saying is

2357.92 --> 2364.96
the daylight there's like a certain time

2361.839 --> 2366.64
when sunlight hits one part

2364.96 --> 2368.64
of the realm we know

2366.64 --> 2372.3199999999997
while the other part is basically in

2368.64 --> 2374.56
darkness there is no sunlight there

2372.32 --> 2375.839
so would you be able to

2374.56 --> 2379.92
reflect

2375.839 --> 2380.88
the daytime sunlight into like a mirror

2379.92 --> 2383.599
tunnel

2380.88 --> 2384.96
and make it reach all the way

2383.599 --> 2387.599
to

2384.96 --> 2389.04
the nighttime

2387.599 --> 2391.6800000000003
region

2389.04 --> 2394.4
and would you then see that sunlight

2391.68 --> 2396.64
on the other end

2394.4 --> 2401.119
that's that's the question

2396.64 --> 2401.1189999999997
that's the setup that i'm curious about

2404.88 --> 2409.319
hello by the way professor phil

2410.64 --> 2414.4
blue

2411.44 --> 2414.4
y4j

2423.599 --> 2428.0
right yeah yeah yeah professor phil like

2426.8 --> 2430.1600000000003
the moon

2428.0 --> 2432.96
doesn't solve that question it's just

2430.16 --> 2434.56
another presupposition i'm talking about

2432.96 --> 2436.48
physically

2434.56 --> 2438.96
reflecting where you know it is a

2436.48 --> 2440.88
reflection because you literally

2438.96 --> 2443.04
put the mirror there

2440.88 --> 2445.599
in order to confirm that it is actually

2443.04 --> 2447.359
reflecting and not presupposing

2445.599 --> 2450.1600000000003
because that doesn't help at all

2447.359 --> 2450.16
professor phil

2450.48 --> 2453.48
right

2460.319 --> 2464.359
hello nathan oakley 1980

2468.0 --> 2471.68
they're probably listening to ads now

2469.68 --> 2475.359
because it i just put forward as a

2471.68 --> 2475.359
really interesting idea i think

2477.68 --> 2481.839
i hope you pick up on it

2485.119 --> 2490.079
yeah that's a good point blue y4j yeah

2488.48 --> 2493.76
that's right

2490.079 --> 2496.2400000000002
there would be no effective nighttime

2493.76 --> 2498.8
because it would just all be scattering

2496.24 --> 2501.359
across the atmosphere

2498.8 --> 2501.3590000000004
shining

2502.56 --> 2507.319
past you would just see it

2533.2 --> 2539.839
what does that mean timothy p southwick

2536.079 --> 2539.8390000000004
that doesn't make any sense to me

2542.72 --> 2546.5989999999997
dark crystal what

2558.88 --> 2563.079
ask chocolate what

2581.359 --> 2584.56
look whatever's too simple i don't get

2583.76 --> 2588.92
it

2584.56 --> 2588.92
from what you said in chat there

2602.88 --> 2607.359
right yeah seeking star wars look when

2604.88 --> 2611.28
you really start to take it serious then

2607.359 --> 2613.52
like endless amounts of problems arrive

2611.28 --> 2615.52
right but i don't want to really

2613.52 --> 2617.839
get into oh what would it look like on

2615.52 --> 2621.28
the ball my setup

2617.839 --> 2625.359
yeah that the reflecting tunnel of

2621.28 --> 2627.44
sunlight from the daylight section

2625.359 --> 2629.5989999999997
of the realm to the night

2627.44 --> 2632.0
side section of the realm

2629.599 --> 2634.7200000000003
is not to prove

2632.0 --> 2637.52
flat earth or disprove the ball

2634.72 --> 2639.5989999999997
it has no relation to that whatsoever

2637.52 --> 2642.16
right so don't

2639.599 --> 2644.56
don't go get all excited about that part

2642.16 --> 2646.7999999999997
it has no relation to that

2644.56 --> 2648.64
like i mean you could drag it in there

2646.8 --> 2651.52
it's just gonna make it more convoluted

2648.64 --> 2652.96
and confusing a lot more convoluted and

2651.52 --> 2656.72
confusing right

2652.96 --> 2660.88
i'm simply interested in the nature

2656.72 --> 2663.359
of the daylight sunlight in itself

2660.88 --> 2665.28
could you reflect

2663.359 --> 2668.16
sunlight

2665.28 --> 2672.0
in some kind of a mirror tunnel

2668.16 --> 2673.68
from the daytime part of the earth all

2672.0 --> 2676.079
the way to the nighttime part of the

2673.68 --> 2678.319
earth and would you still see that sun

2676.079 --> 2680.7200000000003
would you actually see the sunlight

2678.319 --> 2683.04
reflected from all the way over the

2680.72 --> 2683.839
daytime is that possible

2683.04 --> 2686.16
or

2683.839 --> 2687.68
would the holographic nature

2686.16 --> 2689.1189999999997
of the sunlight

2687.68 --> 2691.68
simply

2689.119 --> 2694.6400000000003
make you see the light go into the

2691.68 --> 2695.68
tunnel at the daytime side

2694.64 --> 2698.48
but then

2695.68 --> 2699.839
not see it exit on the other side

2698.48 --> 2703.04
because

2699.839 --> 2705.52
the actual apparent sun over there

2703.04 --> 2708.319
simply doesn't exist there

2705.52 --> 2710.88
so you have nothing to reflect from that

2708.319 --> 2714.16
vantage point even though from the

2710.88 --> 2717.28
origin point you do see it go in

2714.16 --> 2719.839
now that would kind of be a big

2717.28 --> 2722.5600000000004
indicator of a holographic nature

2719.839 --> 2724.88
because there is no logical

2722.56 --> 2727.119
explanation for that i mean people could

2724.88 --> 2730.48
probably wizard out and say oh it's a

2727.119 --> 2731.52
quantum effect or something right

2730.48 --> 2733.44
but

2731.52 --> 2735.2
yeah you can't prevent that from

2733.44 --> 2738.64
happening

2735.2 --> 2738.64
i'm just really curious

2740.64 --> 2746.0
i mean if you would literally be able to

2743.28 --> 2748.1600000000003
see the sunlight reflected from the

2746.0 --> 2750.319
daytime side into a mirror tunnel all

2748.16 --> 2754.24
the way that you could see it at the

2750.319 --> 2754.24
nighttime part of the realm

2754.96 --> 2760.28
then

2755.92 --> 2760.28
that would kind of be a

2760.4 --> 2766.319
the holographic idea

2763.2 --> 2769.04
might be compromised

2766.319 --> 2771.2799999999997
it would give way that maybe there is

2769.04 --> 2772.72
some kind of euclidean nature after all

2771.28 --> 2775.76
to it

2772.72 --> 2777.5989999999997
i'm testing my concept like that's what

2775.76 --> 2781.6800000000003
you need to do

2777.599 --> 2781.6800000000003
to figure out if it's real or not

2787.04 --> 2792.48
a light tunnel with no atmospheric

2789.68 --> 2794.319
obstructions or attenua yeah if possible

2792.48 --> 2796.72
dude if you could make a mirror tunnel

2794.319 --> 2798.48
that's vacuum or that is well very much

2796.72 --> 2800.24
like glass fiber

2798.48 --> 2801.599
pure

2800.24 --> 2803.5989999999997
glass

2801.599 --> 2805.3590000000004
something or that no that wouldn't be

2803.599 --> 2807.28
good that would probably

2805.359 --> 2811.119
absorb the light as well but yeah a

2807.28 --> 2811.119
vacuum tunnel with a mirror system

2811.28 --> 2816.96
so that it wouldn't be absorbed at all

2814.24 --> 2819.5989999999997
that would be quite an effort though

2816.96 --> 2819.599
to make that

2824.72 --> 2829.9599999999996
i'm glad you're thinking with me about

2826.4 --> 2829.96
this steamy traveler

2830.48 --> 2834.2400000000002
are you curious too

2832.96 --> 2837.04
like would

2834.24 --> 2839.359
what i described that you could see the

2837.04 --> 2841.2
daylight or the sunlight

2839.359 --> 2842.48
at the daytime side of

2841.2 --> 2845.9199999999996
of the tube

2842.48 --> 2845.92
that you would see it go in

2846.319 --> 2850.5589999999997
that you know it's like the pattern of

2849.28 --> 2853.0400000000004
the tunnel

2850.559 --> 2854.88
would effectively reflect it from that

2853.04 --> 2856.88
position all the way

2854.88 --> 2858.88
to the other side

2856.88 --> 2861.359
would you see it on the other side or

2858.88 --> 2864.96
would you just see pure darkness because

2861.359 --> 2867.68
the sun in relation to that position

2864.96 --> 2869.599
isn't actually there on the other side

2867.68 --> 2873.72
because it's holographic

2869.599 --> 2873.7200000000003
that's my my curiosity

2882.48 --> 2885.48
right

2887.28 --> 2891.28
exploring the nature of the sun

2896.319 --> 2901.44
how does what you are describing differ

2899.2 --> 2903.4399999999996
from fiber optic cable

2901.44 --> 2906.48
well worship jesus it's basically the

2903.44 --> 2908.7200000000003
same concept except

2906.48 --> 2911.68
fiber optic cables

2908.72 --> 2915.2799999999997
have specific

2911.68 --> 2916.0789999999997
light pulse generators

2915.28 --> 2918.48
right

2916.079 --> 2921.2000000000003
they have to reach from one side of the

2918.48 --> 2923.44
the wire to the to the exit side there's

2921.2 --> 2925.2799999999997
a receiver there

2923.44 --> 2926.839
and then it's like

2925.28 --> 2928.96
usually

2926.839 --> 2931.68
digitized and then

2928.96 --> 2935.68
in another fiber optic cable it's sent

2931.68 --> 2939.2799999999997
out again with a light pulser so

2935.68 --> 2941.44
it's kind of the same system but

2939.28 --> 2943.2000000000003
you can't put like enhancers and that

2941.44 --> 2947.839
doesn't make any sense it has to be like

2943.2 --> 2947.839
the original sunlight that's the point

2954.24 --> 2957.7599999999998
the idea would work according to the

2955.92 --> 2959.359
heliocentric model well thank you

2957.76 --> 2961.44
professor phil bill

2959.359 --> 2964.319
i know it should

2961.44 --> 2966.0
i know it like yeah that's why i said my

2964.319 --> 2967.119
entire setup

2966.0 --> 2970.64
doesn't

2967.119 --> 2973.52
it's not designed to prove or disprove a

2970.64 --> 2976.8799999999997
flat earth or the ball this is all about

2973.52 --> 2978.64
the nature of sunlight

2976.88 --> 2982.119
that's what the test is

2978.64 --> 2982.1189999999997
thought up for

2985.52 --> 2989.2
a portal to vary it

2989.839 --> 2994.48
well a

2991.52 --> 2995.839
that's a good idea actually

2994.48 --> 2998.88
like

2995.839 --> 3000.0789999999997
there should be like a an ability to

2998.88 --> 3002.2400000000002
basically

3000.079 --> 3004.8
add on a modifier for the light

3002.24 --> 3004.7999999999997
direction

3007.92 --> 3013.92
man you could end up with all kinds of

3010.16 --> 3016.319
really weird freaky situations

3013.92 --> 3018.88
like that's gonna like completely blow

3016.319 --> 3019.68
people's mind when they test it

3018.88 --> 3021.6800000000003
like

3019.68 --> 3023.52
this yeah is this basically science

3021.68 --> 3025.2
fiction in my mind

3023.52 --> 3027.7599999999998
but like what if

3025.2 --> 3029.52
you end up

3027.76 --> 3031.92
like they just vary the light and like

3029.52 --> 3034.319
at some point it does come through but

3031.92 --> 3036.64
then it doesn't make any logical sense

3034.319 --> 3039.359
from an entry side again assuming like

3036.64 --> 3042.319
the pure holographic nature of it

3039.359 --> 3044.5589999999997
that on the entry side the reflector

3042.319 --> 3046.5589999999997
would actually be

3044.559 --> 3048.48
reflecting the sunlight from that

3046.559 --> 3053.0400000000004
position

3048.48 --> 3053.04
not inside the tube but past it

3053.44 --> 3058.88
but that you would then

3055.92 --> 3060.88
specifically going past it see it on the

3058.88 --> 3063.839
other side

3060.88 --> 3065.6800000000003
and then everybody would be like ah

3063.839 --> 3067.839
what's going on

3065.68 --> 3070.96
well maybe

3067.839 --> 3074.319
reflector when aiming on the entry side

3070.96 --> 3076.559
aiming the reflection beam of sunlight

3074.319 --> 3079.359
over the tube and not inside it is

3076.559 --> 3081.76
actually perfectly positioned

3079.359 --> 3083.119
all the way on the other side

3081.76 --> 3085.28
for where

3083.119 --> 3089.04
from that vantage point

3085.28 --> 3091.2000000000003
the holographic sun would be

3089.04 --> 3093.04
something like that

3091.2 --> 3094.24
that would be weird

3093.04 --> 3096.5589999999997
it might

3094.24 --> 3098.3999999999996
be a possibility

3096.559 --> 3099.44
but yeah on the other hand it could just

3098.4 --> 3101.44
be like

3099.44 --> 3102.319
that there's just not going to be any

3101.44 --> 3104.079
light

3102.319 --> 3107.2
received on the other side no matter

3104.079 --> 3108.319
where you put the reflector etc etc

3107.2 --> 3111.2
because

3108.319 --> 3113.92
in relation to that other side

3111.2 --> 3117.2799999999997
the sun simply doesn't exist

3113.92 --> 3119.2000000000003
on the other side so there is no light

3117.28 --> 3120.96
actually coming all the way from there

3119.2 --> 3123.359
to be received

3120.96 --> 3124.48
from that vantage point holographic

3123.359 --> 3127.44
nature

3124.48 --> 3127.44
right yeah

3128.4 --> 3135.2000000000003
across the night sky

3131.44 --> 3139.04
no no it's not a this is fiber optics

3135.2 --> 3141.359
cable that doesn't work

3139.04 --> 3143.92
fiber optic cables only work because

3141.359 --> 3146.24
they have pulse light

3143.92 --> 3150.4
they have light

3146.24 --> 3152.64
pulse generators at the ends

3150.4 --> 3154.1600000000003
it has to be enhanced

3152.64 --> 3154.96
because

3154.16 --> 3159.2
yeah

3154.96 --> 3160.8
light is still being absorbed in fiber

3159.2 --> 3162.8799999999997
optic cables right

3160.8 --> 3167.6400000000003
it would have to be much more like a

3162.88 --> 3167.6400000000003
vacuum tube with mirrors

3169.52 --> 3174.72
but the idea is based on fiber optic

3172.8 --> 3176.88
cables like how can you make light

3174.72 --> 3179.2799999999997
travel all the way

3176.88 --> 3182.0
vast distance

3179.28 --> 3183.599
inside something

3182.0 --> 3185.44
so that it doesn't scatter it doesn't

3183.599 --> 3187.28
diffuse it doesn't get all absorbed

3185.44 --> 3189.28
that's the idea

3187.28 --> 3190.8
not literally fiber optic cables that

3189.28 --> 3193.3590000000004
doesn't make any sense it has to be

3190.8 --> 3194.88
original sunlight going through that

3193.359 --> 3196.5589999999997
you can't just like oh absorb the

3194.88 --> 3199.2000000000003
sunlight oh then we're going to put a

3196.559 --> 3202.8
pulse in there to translate the sunlight

3199.2 --> 3205.1189999999997
that that's pointless

3202.8 --> 3208.599
it has to be the original sunlight

3205.119 --> 3208.599
that's the point

3214.319 --> 3219.88
yeah pretty amazing eh worship jesus i

3216.88 --> 3219.88
agree

3232.64 --> 3237.2
wouldn't it be interesting

3235.44 --> 3239.2000000000003
as you could

3237.2 --> 3241.68
expand that test once you have the

3239.2 --> 3242.5589999999997
device made to make the the sunlight

3241.68 --> 3244.72
test

3242.559 --> 3247.6800000000003
you could then also literally

3244.72 --> 3247.68
take a laser

3247.839 --> 3252.48
it would have to be kind of strong and

3250.72 --> 3255.2
put it in there too and you would

3252.48 --> 3259.2
probably then see the laser on the other

3255.2 --> 3259.2
side because it isn't holographic

3262.839 --> 3268.72
right because it exists

3266.8 --> 3270.2400000000002
all the way in the distance

3268.72 --> 3273.2799999999997
just the same

3270.24 --> 3273.2799999999997
with the same pattern

3274.559 --> 3278.4
because it's a yeah a light originating

3276.96 --> 3283.359
from physical

3278.4 --> 3285.52
things so it is euclidean anchored

3283.359 --> 3288.16
right anyway

3285.52 --> 3292.2
just an idea

3288.16 --> 3292.2
you can think about it

3299.119 --> 3301.92
hey lg

3305.44 --> 3310.0
can magnetism be reflected

3308.64 --> 3313.68
no

3310.0 --> 3313.68
it can be deflected though

3314.64 --> 3318.24
magnet magnetic field can be enhanced

3317.119 --> 3321.2000000000003
can be

3318.24 --> 3323.2
deflected can be absorbed

3321.2 --> 3324.3999999999996
but you can't reflect it because it's

3323.2 --> 3327.72
not light

3324.4 --> 3327.7200000000003
it's a field

3336.16 --> 3342.16
back to my accounting job today okay

3338.799 --> 3342.16
clary good luck

3343.52 --> 3348.04
i'll stop trafficking my rest ahead

3349.28 --> 3352.559
all right

3350.48 --> 3355.04
up for fitness see you later psychics

3352.559 --> 3355.0400000000004
traveler

3359.2 --> 3363.68
isn't radar electromagnetic that gets

3361.92 --> 3365.76
reflected

3363.68 --> 3367.359
no

3365.76 --> 3369.0400000000004
it isn't

3367.359 --> 3373.319
its

3369.04 --> 3373.319
radar falls under light

3378.64 --> 3383.44
radar isn't just a magnetic field being

3381.119 --> 3385.76
all magnetic no it's

3383.44 --> 3385.76
light

3386.96 --> 3394.2
in guitar shopping okay rest that hey

3390.24 --> 3394.2
good servant good to see you

3443.92 --> 3448.2400000000002
aren't radio signals em waves

3450.799 --> 3452.96
no

3454.559 --> 3459.28
i mean they have well oh god it gets a

3457.68 --> 3461.68
bit complicated it wasn't really

3459.28 --> 3463.6800000000003
prepared for that question

3461.68 --> 3466.319
look

3463.68 --> 3468.799
radio signals kind of fall under the

3466.319 --> 3471.52
behavior of light

3468.799 --> 3474.52
and light reflects and so do radio

3471.52 --> 3474.52
signals

3491.839 --> 3497.359
the moon is a map

3493.359 --> 3500.7599999999998
maybe it's very distorted map though

3497.359 --> 3500.7599999999998
if it is

3514.48 --> 3517.839
okay rest dad

3527.68 --> 3532.9199999999996
really too i what are you talking about

3558.4 --> 3561.92
all right but yeah george sand for the

3560.0 --> 3567.24
whole point here is that

3561.92 --> 3567.2400000000002
a magnetic field is not the same thing

3573.44 --> 3578.2400000000002
like a magnetic film has a distinct

3575.599 --> 3581.119
limited range

3578.24 --> 3584.0789999999997
it doesn't reflect

3581.119 --> 3586.2400000000002
so even though yeah electromagnetic

3584.079 --> 3591.48
it's not a magnetic field that's that

3586.24 --> 3591.4799999999996
was my point okay it's not the same

3612.64 --> 3617.2
well timothy's peace out

3614.96 --> 3617.2
look

3617.52 --> 3621.599
maybe you should put a little bit more

3619.52 --> 3624.079
effort in how you're writing things down

3621.599 --> 3625.44
because it's not helping

3624.079 --> 3626.6400000000003
you're

3625.44 --> 3628.4
you're like

3626.64 --> 3629.839
presenting it in a

3628.4 --> 3632.64
bit of a

3629.839 --> 3632.64
scattered way

3637.2 --> 3643.72
fiberglass or carbon or something

3640.079 --> 3643.7200000000003
question about what

3650.24 --> 3655.359
isn't radio controlled sparked like a

3652.24 --> 3658.319
spark plug yeah perhaps

3655.359 --> 3661.04
what it isn't though is a literal magnet

3658.319 --> 3664.88
a magnet it's not just a magnet a

3661.04 --> 3664.88
magnetic field that's what it isn't

3667.52 --> 3671.799
the ovation what

3677.839 --> 3681.799
what what are you talking about

3713.04 --> 3716.64
she doesn't have to leave me alone i

3714.72 --> 3719.359
just want to know what she's talking

3716.64 --> 3721.5989999999997
about like ovation what ovation

3719.359 --> 3721.5989999999997
what

3722.96 --> 3726.48
you mean everybody standing up and

3724.799 --> 3729.68
applauding like what

3726.48 --> 3731.039
ovation guitar oh oh okay

3729.68 --> 3733.359
okay

3731.039 --> 3734.3190000000004
it's a guitar right so yeah

3733.359 --> 3736.88
oh

3734.319 --> 3739.2799999999997
dude i'm not a guitar specialist i don't

3736.88 --> 3740.88
know a lot about guitars

3739.28 --> 3743.52
like my dad does

3740.88 --> 3743.52
i don't

3750.559 --> 3755.8390000000004
a traveling magnetic field that

3753.28 --> 3755.8390000000004
what

3760.799 --> 3763.0389999999998
that

3764.16 --> 3768.68
that doesn't make any sense to me

3769.839 --> 3772.96
a traveling magnetic field

3772.16 --> 3775.839
so

3772.96 --> 3778.319
in that case then radio signals would be

3775.839 --> 3782.24
able to

3778.319 --> 3783.52
magnetize metal

3782.24 --> 3786.8799999999997
can it

3783.52 --> 3786.88
over distance really

3788.079 --> 3792.079
ah

3789.039 --> 3793.2000000000003
okay thank you blue j4

3792.079 --> 3795.2000000000003
j

3793.2 --> 3796.64
blue y4j

3795.2 --> 3799.52
for the

3796.64 --> 3803.839
799 australian dollar super chat buy

3799.52 --> 3806.4
seed for the birds yeah well if it

3803.839 --> 3809.799
once i see that being sold again i

3806.4 --> 3809.799
probably will

3810.799 --> 3814.64
thank you for the for the donation

3816.0 --> 3820.24
i was talking with erasta

3818.96 --> 3824.28
right

3820.24 --> 3824.2799999999997
oh i didn't know that

3826.4 --> 3830.52
anyway i'll be back in two minutes

3872.72 --> 3875.72
so

3909.2 --> 3911.9199999999996
and i'm back

3916.559 --> 3923.2000000000003
hey how to kill the ho long time no see

3920.88 --> 3926.1600000000003
of course we didn't get the jab

3923.2 --> 3929.68
well i think some of the yeah

3926.16 --> 3933.2799999999997
tiny womble did with this

3929.68 --> 3933.2799999999997
what is he now called cps

3934.319 --> 3937.839
he's still around apparently

3947.119 --> 3954.92
i lost job because of no facts okay did

3950.16 --> 3954.92
you get fired or did you quit

3966.319 --> 3971.68
melbourne australia

3969.119 --> 3975.6800000000003
how is your life with that cure i dude i

3971.68 --> 3979.839
never even seen it i kill the hope

3975.68 --> 3979.839
i've never even seen it

3981.119 --> 3988.1600000000003
i haven't been facing any kind of

3984.16 --> 3988.16
issues with that [ __ ] thank god

3990.16 --> 3995.0389999999998
fired okay

3993.28 --> 3996.559
oh yeah that's

3995.039 --> 4000.1600000000003
yeah there's nothing else you can really

3996.559 --> 4003.039
do now but at least like you were fired

4000.16 --> 4005.7599999999998
and yeah technically unjustly so on the

4003.039 --> 4008.2400000000002
long run you might have a foothold to

4005.76 --> 4008.2400000000002
basically

4008.319 --> 4013.52
after this is all over

4010.16 --> 4016.0
hopefully that will at some point happen

4013.52 --> 4018.72
you'll be able to like get something

4016.0 --> 4020.559
back for it plumber what you got fired

4018.72 --> 4023.5989999999997
from being a plumber because you didn't

4020.559 --> 4023.599
get the what

4026.319 --> 4032.119
but that's like a solitary worker what

4028.88 --> 4032.119
the hell

4044.079 --> 4046.88
yeah

4044.88 --> 4048.96
well dude if you're a plumber i'd

4046.88 --> 4050.88
definitely not take it

4048.96 --> 4053.119
because as a plumber you're constantly

4050.88 --> 4054.96
going to be just like garbage men

4053.119 --> 4056.079
exposed

4054.96 --> 4058.48
to

4056.079 --> 4062.48
well lots of different

4058.48 --> 4064.88
people's bacteria etc etc so you need

4062.48 --> 4068.079
that immune system that natural immunity

4064.88 --> 4068.079
a lot so yeah

4069.839 --> 4073.68
right

4070.64 --> 4077.319
you made the right choice but

4073.68 --> 4077.319
doesn't mean like

4079.28 --> 4082.799
it doesn't mean it's not going to be

4080.72 --> 4084.5589999999997
difficult

4082.799 --> 4087.359
but yeah

4084.559 --> 4088.48
sue them yeah if that's possible

4087.359 --> 4090.4
right

4088.48 --> 4093.52
i think right now it's not even really

4090.4 --> 4097.039
possible but i might be wrong i might be

4093.52 --> 4097.039
maybe you can already do that

4099.52 --> 4104.400000000001
but maybe there is like an entire

4102.159 --> 4105.839
organization out there

4104.4 --> 4107.92
like a group of lawyers that

4105.839 --> 4111.12
specifically

4107.92 --> 4112.0
is using people that are fired because

4111.12 --> 4114.48
of this

4112.0 --> 4116.48
to kind of build a a massive case

4114.48 --> 4118.4
against it all right that sort of thing

4116.48 --> 4120.639999999999
does happen so maybe they're out there

4118.4 --> 4124.5199999999995
in australia i don't know if they are

4120.64 --> 4124.52
it would be worth investigating

4136.4 --> 4139.599999999999
for you by the way

4144.88 --> 4149.679
state of emergency yeah but it's state

4147.44 --> 4151.839
of emergency based on false premises

4149.679 --> 4154.4800000000005
like technically in ways the entire

4151.839 --> 4156.0
thing is illegal

4154.48 --> 4158.3189999999995
right

4156.0 --> 4161.199
and if you then get damages

4158.319 --> 4163.759
because of that while it's not

4161.199 --> 4166.4
technically set up correctly like they

4163.759 --> 4169.679
don't actually have the proof they need

4166.4 --> 4171.679
to truly legitimately instate this state

4169.679 --> 4172.56
of emergency

4171.679 --> 4175.4400000000005
right

4172.56 --> 4177.92
then you got a an angle you you can get

4175.44 --> 4179.678999999999
an angle legally there's lawyers out

4177.92 --> 4182.0
there that really understand how that

4179.679 --> 4184.2390000000005
works i don't i just know they're out

4182.0 --> 4184.239
there

4184.96 --> 4189.839
so it's definitely worth

4186.799 --> 4189.839
searching around

4197.36 --> 4201.5199999999995
spread no i don't think that's possible

4199.76 --> 4203.52
steamy traveler

4201.52 --> 4206.0
look what they put in there is a

4203.52 --> 4208.320000000001
reactive compound

4206.0 --> 4208.32
right

4208.8 --> 4213.92
it only works because it is directly

4211.92 --> 4216.88
injected

4213.92 --> 4218.8
if you like spray it it's gonna react

4216.88 --> 4220.96
entropy is gonna happen

4218.8 --> 4221.92
and then

4220.96 --> 4224.56
yeah

4221.92 --> 4226.96
eventually it'll just not be what what

4224.56 --> 4226.96
it was

4228.56 --> 4233.1990000000005
so i don't think so i think that's a

4230.4 --> 4236.48
rumor now they might try other [ __ ] they

4233.199 --> 4239.199
might genetically modify plants to

4236.48 --> 4241.28
basically screw you over but it's not

4239.199 --> 4244.48
going to be the same

4241.28 --> 4245.759999999999
mrna substance thing right

4244.48 --> 4246.879999999999
that's not what

4245.76 --> 4249.12
like that's

4246.88 --> 4252.12
logically impossible from what i've

4249.12 --> 4252.12
learned

4260.56 --> 4264.320000000001
like just like

4262.48 --> 4267.759999999999
the idea of

4264.32 --> 4270.759999999999
spike protein leeching to me is

4267.76 --> 4270.76
illogical

4272.08 --> 4275.44
unless you like literally just eat that

4274.56 --> 4278.4800000000005
[ __ ]

4275.44 --> 4281.36
or something terrible like that

4278.48 --> 4283.36
then it might happen i don't know

4281.36 --> 4285.5199999999995
but just like straight out like ooh

4283.36 --> 4288.08
somebody took the v and then oh they're

4285.52 --> 4290.2390000000005
shedding and now i got it

4288.08 --> 4290.239
no

4290.56 --> 4294.1990000000005
i don't believe that

4321.84 --> 4325.04
yeah

4322.719 --> 4329.36
blue y4j yeah there's a lot of big

4325.04 --> 4331.6
protests going on and they don't show it

4329.36 --> 4334.159
at all

4331.6 --> 4337.04
like the media is acting like it's just

4334.159 --> 4339.12
the new soviet era

4337.04 --> 4340.64
except this time it's not just

4339.12 --> 4342.64
russia it's

4340.64 --> 4344.96
freaking half the world

4342.64 --> 4347.4400000000005
they're acting like soviets it's

4344.96 --> 4347.44
terrible

4347.6 --> 4352.4800000000005
like full

4349.12 --> 4352.48
full-blown censorship

4355.36 --> 4359.44
and by the way i myself there google is

4357.84 --> 4361.04
acting weird too i think i addressed it

4359.44 --> 4363.919999999999
yesterday as well

4361.04 --> 4366.48
but there's people i went over to jose's

4363.92 --> 4368.88
just to say hello whatever and

4366.48 --> 4371.04
sean hawkins started whining of course

4368.88 --> 4373.76
he typically hangs around there

4371.04 --> 4376.159
but like jose said like i'm blocked over

4373.76 --> 4378.4800000000005
at your chat what's going on

4376.159 --> 4380.4
and i literally showed on screen like

4378.48 --> 4382.4
yeah you're not blocked you're not

4380.4 --> 4385.36
blocked in google

4382.4 --> 4386.639999999999
you're not banned in my list i showed

4385.36 --> 4389.12
the list

4386.64 --> 4391.679
searched on jose he's not in there so

4389.12 --> 4393.84
for some reason he isn't able unable to

4391.679 --> 4394.719
comment as if he is blocked

4393.84 --> 4397.52
but

4394.719 --> 4399.84
who's doing that

4397.52 --> 4401.84
how is that possible he's not in any of

4399.84 --> 4404.0
my blocked lists

4401.84 --> 4406.4800000000005
and he's not the first one

4404.0 --> 4408.56
there's other guys too that have like

4406.48 --> 4410.159
asked me like why am i blocked i'm like

4408.56 --> 4411.92
what you're not blocked you're not in

4410.159 --> 4414.08
there i don't i don't even know who you

4411.92 --> 4414.08
are

4414.239 --> 4417.04
what's going on

4418.96 --> 4422.64
people are being barred from

4422.719 --> 4427.199
interacting with me

4424.96 --> 4430.2390000000005
in my chat and comment section and i

4427.199 --> 4432.639999999999
don't even know how that's possible

4430.239 --> 4435.44
unless there's some weird shadow banning

4432.64 --> 4435.4400000000005
thing going on

4436.08 --> 4440.239
that's like outside of the normal

4438.4 --> 4444.08
technical structure of how youtube

4440.239 --> 4446.239
functions i don't know what what it is

4444.08 --> 4447.44
but it's been happening

4446.239 --> 4449.678999999999
for a while

4447.44 --> 4453.08
i'm not the only one reporting this it's

4449.679 --> 4453.08
very confusing

4455.199 --> 4459.919999999999
like maybe that's

4458.0 --> 4463.04
maybe the same thing

4459.92 --> 4467.64
maybe that's the reason why i'm banned

4463.04 --> 4467.64
at over a geronism's chat

4475.76 --> 4481.12
maybe he didn't do that maybe he did

4477.44 --> 4483.44
actually look through the blocked list

4481.12 --> 4487.12
and i'm not in there i don't know

4483.44 --> 4487.12
they haven't communicated back to me

4491.84 --> 4494.84
what

4503.12 --> 4507.64
anti flat earth hacking what

4513.52 --> 4518.8
bob banned many injuries yeah it could

4515.44 --> 4518.799999999999
be that could also be it

4518.88 --> 4524.96
but i specifically sent jaron an email

4522.8 --> 4526.8
about it

4524.96 --> 4529.199
like hey could you please unblock me

4526.8 --> 4531.679
maybe give me a wrench i swear i won't

4529.199 --> 4533.678999999999
use it ever

4531.679 --> 4536.719
not even to put in links or anything i

4533.679 --> 4538.8
just i just want to be able to just

4536.719 --> 4540.719
comment and just like hang around

4538.8 --> 4543.92
because i have been appreciating a lot

4540.719 --> 4543.92
of jaren's streams

4544.719 --> 4548.8
but yeah i did haven't had any email

4547.12 --> 4551.8
back and that's been like two weeks ago

4548.8 --> 4551.8
now

4563.76 --> 4569.64
yeah pj crew shank i know it is silly

4589.199 --> 4594.599999999999
he isn't unbanning any longer what

4595.36 --> 4597.599999999999
why

4604.56 --> 4610.4800000000005
so he's basically just straight out

4607.28 --> 4612.239
abandoning the chat

4610.48 --> 4614.959999999999
i mean he doesn't seem to really

4612.239 --> 4616.879999999999
interact with chat

4614.96 --> 4619.04
during his show so yeah

4616.88 --> 4622.32
maybe just doesn't care anymore about it

4619.04 --> 4624.96
it's too much hassle could be i mean i

4622.32 --> 4626.5599999999995
can't really blame him for that

4624.96 --> 4628.4
but it is kind of disappointing because

4626.56 --> 4631.4400000000005
i i liked it just

4628.4 --> 4635.0
be arwin in chats

4631.44 --> 4635.0
give my input

4645.44 --> 4652.08
he trusts his mother oh all right

4648.239 --> 4652.08
right so he's just yeah

4652.88 --> 4657.96
pretty much comes down to the same thing

4654.64 --> 4657.96
doesn't it

4677.84 --> 4679.92
you

4707.199 --> 4712.5599999999995
right i got a title for today

4710.159 --> 4715.199
definitely worth it also good for me to

4712.56 --> 4717.280000000001
find it back because i think this is

4715.199 --> 4719.599999999999
this is just like the time when i

4717.28 --> 4721.199
thought of like how could we

4719.6 --> 4724.0
figure out what is happening with this

4721.199 --> 4725.919999999999
apparent cold moonlight right how can

4724.0 --> 4729.12
you test it whether it is literally

4725.92 --> 4731.1990000000005
cold's insertion which would be very odd

4729.12 --> 4732.8
it wouldn't fit the normal understanding

4731.199 --> 4735.599999999999
we have of physics

4732.8 --> 4737.92
or is it like an entropy enhancer that

4735.6 --> 4739.92
it makes things cool off further like i

4737.92 --> 4742.56
had an old item about that like a year

4739.92 --> 4742.56
ago or more

4742.64 --> 4747.52
if i titled the show after it then i can

4745.52 --> 4748.88
literally find it back pretty quickly so

4747.52 --> 4751.1990000000005
i'm doing that right here because i

4748.88 --> 4753.52
think this is also an interesting

4751.199 --> 4753.5199999999995
test

4755.28 --> 4760.84
darwinian test idea although this one's

4758.32 --> 4762.48
going to be a lot more difficult to

4760.84 --> 4763.52
actually

4762.48 --> 4764.639999999999
do that

4763.52 --> 4766.159000000001
physically

4764.64 --> 4768.88
because yeah you're gonna have to have

4766.159 --> 4770.48
one hell of a big device to

4768.88 --> 4774.08
literally

4770.48 --> 4777.08
stretch over half the world

4774.08 --> 4777.08
right

4796.48 --> 4799.5199999999995
wow

4797.76 --> 4800.719
where did all those down votes come from

4799.52 --> 4805.320000000001
all of a sudden

4800.719 --> 4805.32
there's not even like a baller in here

4814.88 --> 4817.88
weird

4850.48 --> 4855.04
in the middle of full out war

4857.84 --> 4861.28
yeah

4858.8 --> 4864.2390000000005
no but timothy it matters

4861.28 --> 4866.88
communicate in war communication matters

4864.239 --> 4868.638999999999
more than ever before right if it's just

4866.88 --> 4870.4800000000005
like oh whatever

4868.639 --> 4873.36
yeah blabber around doesn't really

4870.48 --> 4876.718999999999
matter that's fine but yeah

4873.36 --> 4878.639
we need to actually get sharp develop

4876.719 --> 4881.04
improve our communication skills because

4878.639 --> 4882.96
that's really important you want to

4881.04 --> 4885.28
actually fight the war

4882.96 --> 4887.84
this war that you perceive

4885.28 --> 4889.12
or you just want to complain about it

4887.84 --> 4892.400000000001
improve

4889.12 --> 4892.4
work on it work on it

4899.44 --> 4903.5599999999995
there's nothing to do with drugs

4906.719 --> 4910.08
okay that's a little harsh steamy

4908.639 --> 4912.0
traveler

4910.08 --> 4916.36
don't think that's

4912.0 --> 4916.36
really necessary thing to do

4944.88 --> 4949.52
yeah it's nothing to this yet

4947.28 --> 4949.5199999999995
well

4949.6 --> 4955.4400000000005
i thought we was trying i just

4952.8 --> 4958.320000000001
couldn't really see the point

4955.44 --> 4959.678999999999
it was seemed incohesive or he was just

4958.32 --> 4963.12
like not

4959.679 --> 4965.6
able to put it down cohesively

4963.12 --> 4965.599999999999
i don't know

4967.199 --> 4971.678999999999
but i think you're being a little rough

4968.8 --> 4973.52
there you know it doesn't mean bad he's

4971.679 --> 4975.28
not like a troll

4973.52 --> 4978.280000000001
doesn't deserve to be talked to like

4975.28 --> 4978.28
that

4998.719 --> 5001.76
what what are you talking about george

5000.56 --> 5004.4800000000005
heffern

5001.76 --> 5006.0
only on videos that are highly voted

5004.48 --> 5008.0
down

5006.0 --> 5011.28
dot

5008.0 --> 5011.28
pushes the lies what

5011.52 --> 5015.6
are you saying that my videos pushes the

5013.76 --> 5016.719
lies what are you talking about george

5015.6 --> 5020.4400000000005
sanford

5016.719 --> 5020.44
what are you talking about

5032.0 --> 5035.6
pushes the

5034.32 --> 5038.639
maybe

5035.6 --> 5039.679
maybe they do maybe they're just sick

5038.639 --> 5042.8
of

5039.679 --> 5046.32
well trolls piling on maybe they

5042.8 --> 5049.679
are intimidated by the really cheap ass

5046.32 --> 5051.679
gamma peer pressure that's being exerted

5049.679 --> 5053.36
maybe they don't want to be like they

5051.679 --> 5056.4800000000005
don't want to be reminded about it so

5053.36 --> 5060.08
they take it away

5056.48 --> 5060.08
right i don't have that issue

5068.48 --> 5073.5599999999995
not government propaganda wow oh really

5093.44 --> 5099.44
dyslexia could be why sentence include

5096.159 --> 5102.08
no no usually it isn't

5099.44 --> 5104.799999999999
dyslexia doesn't disable you from

5102.08 --> 5107.36
formulating coherent sentences

5104.8 --> 5108.96
it just makes you unable to spell things

5107.36 --> 5112.159
correctly

5108.96 --> 5114.8
you might have trouble typing

5112.159 --> 5117.599999999999
now if you're so bad at it that simply

5114.8 --> 5120.88
it becomes undecipherable then yeah

5117.6 --> 5122.8
but no dyslexia doesn't really relate to

5120.88 --> 5126.4800000000005
the coherence

5122.8 --> 5128.400000000001
of the thought behind the sentence that

5126.48 --> 5130.799999999999
that's not how that works

5128.4 --> 5135.638999999999
it's more like it just jumbles up the

5130.8 --> 5135.639
the medium the letters for you

5141.52 --> 5149.56
that's just stupid that's dumb joke blue

5145.04 --> 5149.56
y 4j that's dumb

5154.8 --> 5157.92
yoda had a point

5158.159 --> 5164.839999999999
he was not undeciphered we just switched

5160.4 --> 5164.839999999999
a couple of words around that's all

5174.159 --> 5177.159
do

5203.28 --> 5208.32
and i'm always nice and polite well i

5205.36 --> 5212.639
try to be sometimes i get pissed off and

5208.32 --> 5212.639
then i'm less nice and polite

5212.719 --> 5218.4
but yeah i try to avoid that

5216.32 --> 5220.239
if somebody's gonna like push me in that

5218.4 --> 5221.839999999999
then i kind of like have to take a stand

5220.239 --> 5224.08
and then yeah it's no longer nice and

5221.84 --> 5226.32
polite in that moment that's just how i

5224.08 --> 5226.32
work

5232.639 --> 5237.92
but yeah nice and polite can also get in

5235.04 --> 5241.44
the way of progress can also just like

5237.92 --> 5242.88
oh just don't ruffle any feathers

5241.44 --> 5244.4
don't make them feel bad about

5242.88 --> 5246.96
themselves well sometimes you just need

5244.4 --> 5250.839999999999
to do that you just need to do like

5246.96 --> 5253.76
or just like hey that's stupid

5250.84 --> 5255.04
because then you're just being honest

5253.76 --> 5256.159000000001
right

5255.04 --> 5258.88
not to

5256.159 --> 5260.08
pull somebody down but to just kind of

5258.88 --> 5262.08
like hey

5260.08 --> 5264.0
maybe this isn't what you think it is

5262.08 --> 5267.48
maybe you should do a little better it's

5264.0 --> 5267.48
called encouragement

5274.639 --> 5278.56
now of course that

5276.0 --> 5280.8
and form of encouragement can like hit

5278.56 --> 5283.04
the wrong button

5280.8 --> 5285.4400000000005
that's always a bit of a risk can't be

5283.04 --> 5285.44
helped

5286.4 --> 5291.28
especially if i'm kind of in a bad mood

5289.04 --> 5292.84
and then that radiates through

5291.28 --> 5295.759999999999
and that makes

5292.84 --> 5297.679
that yeah that form of communication

5295.76 --> 5299.92
that action

5297.679 --> 5301.12
less

5299.92 --> 5303.12
viable

5301.12 --> 5306.5599999999995
less chances of succeeding but yeah

5303.12 --> 5306.5599999999995
there's nothing i can really do about

5306.84 --> 5312.96
that you have children in the future

5309.52 --> 5312.96
will you do homeschooling

5319.199 --> 5323.12
definitely

5321.52 --> 5324.96
or i do like

5323.12 --> 5325.76
partial homeschooling it all depends you

5324.96 --> 5327.6
know

5325.76 --> 5329.4400000000005
i don't really want to deprive my

5327.6 --> 5333.04
children from

5329.44 --> 5336.199
learning how to deal with other people

5333.04 --> 5336.199
as well

5341.76 --> 5347.04
but i will absolutely end up just

5344.8 --> 5351.0
teaching them constantly obsessively

5347.04 --> 5351.0
because they can't help it

5354.32 --> 5358.48
but not like

5356.48 --> 5360.08
not to the point where they just try to

5358.48 --> 5363.12
avoid me because they don't want to do

5360.08 --> 5364.719
that right but i'll be yeah i'll do my

5363.12 --> 5365.599999999999
best i don't know

5364.719 --> 5367.76
let's

5365.6 --> 5370.320000000001
get to let's get a girlfriend first and

5367.76 --> 5370.320000000001
then we'll see

5372.48 --> 5376.879999999999
it's like oh what

5374.32 --> 5379.44
what type of

5376.88 --> 5380.96
roofing will i use

5379.44 --> 5383.678999999999
for my

5380.96 --> 5385.52
big house once i'm successful and this

5383.679 --> 5386.88
and that like what

5385.52 --> 5390.400000000001
uh

5386.88 --> 5390.400000000001
that's like very

5390.56 --> 5393.84
far in the distance

5401.679 --> 5404.639
is homeschooling popular in the

5403.36 --> 5407.36
netherlands

5404.639 --> 5409.52
i'm not i'm not sure how that works

5407.36 --> 5411.839999999999
like

5409.52 --> 5416.2390000000005
i don't know

5411.84 --> 5416.2390000000005
if they even just normally allow it here

5419.12 --> 5422.5599999999995
i haven't really looked into it all that

5421.12 --> 5424.32
much

5422.56 --> 5426.8
i haven't been home schooled but my

5424.32 --> 5428.639
parents were always there though

5426.8 --> 5432.84
to answer questions

5428.639 --> 5432.84
and that worked really well for me

5437.6 --> 5443.6
allow yeah that's right allow yeah this

5440.0 --> 5443.6
is the [ __ ] netherlands okay

5445.84 --> 5449.159000000001
it's different

5453.679 --> 5460.4
i don't know

5455.28 --> 5460.4
i haven't looked into it really

5461.6 --> 5464.88
it might be that it's just not allowed

5463.44 --> 5466.5599999999995
here at all

5464.88 --> 5468.8
it's like you have to

5466.56 --> 5470.400000000001
maybe it it maybe i'm just wrong i don't

5468.8 --> 5473.28
know i

5470.4 --> 5476.28
do i could google it i could just google

5473.28 --> 5476.28
it

5478.08 --> 5483.04
homeschooling netherlands there you go

5485.04 --> 5487.6
netherlands

5488.96 --> 5492.2390000000005
well there is foreign organization for

5491.04 --> 5493.84
it

5492.239 --> 5495.599999999999
oh

5493.84 --> 5498.639
that is most relevant to non-dutch

5495.6 --> 5498.639
speakers okay

5501.44 --> 5505.839999999999
i think it there is it exists

5524.239 --> 5530.04
huh

5525.28 --> 5530.04
yeah it seems like it is

5532.0 --> 5535.52
right

5532.8 --> 5537.360000000001
cool well now i know now i know for sure

5535.52 --> 5539.52
because i've never looked it up before

5537.36 --> 5542.159
and now i have so now i know there's

5539.52 --> 5545.88
homeschooling here cool

5542.159 --> 5545.879999999999
that's very good

5553.12 --> 5556.88
what activities

5554.48 --> 5556.879999999999
dude

5558.56 --> 5564.400000000001
i'm sorry i don't have to report about

5562.56 --> 5568.080000000001
that thanks

5564.4 --> 5568.08
this is getting a bit invasive

5572.4 --> 5578.32
i don't really have any

5575.76 --> 5580.8
activities that typically

5578.32 --> 5583.599999999999
would help advance me

5580.8 --> 5586.639
from getting a girlfriend

5583.6 --> 5590.719
i'm just trying to

5586.639 --> 5594.08
be me and figure out like how who am i

5590.719 --> 5596.88
in this world how is everybody like

5594.08 --> 5599.5199999999995
is there even women out there that i can

5596.88 --> 5599.52
connect with

5601.52 --> 5603.84
right

5608.239 --> 5614.5199999999995
like you're not gonna find me on the

5610.4 --> 5614.5199999999995
dating market or anything

5616.0 --> 5620.56
church

5618.32 --> 5620.5599999999995
uh

5620.719 --> 5626.0
i did kind of try that

5623.04 --> 5629.04
years ago like in the

5626.0 --> 5632.159
mormon church over there there were some

5629.04 --> 5632.159
interesting women there

5632.239 --> 5635.599999999999
there was one that was really cute but

5633.76 --> 5637.84
then she just married

5635.6 --> 5637.84
so

5638.08 --> 5641.639
yeah now

5648.32 --> 5654.639
give us the juicy parts no no

5651.36 --> 5654.639
this is my private life

5655.04 --> 5661.92
i mean dude i already like talk about

5659.52 --> 5665.280000000001
x relationships and all that sometimes

5661.92 --> 5665.28
and that's already kind of like

5666.4 --> 5670.44
pushing it a little really

5674.4 --> 5679.199
like this is not an only fans account

5677.12 --> 5681.92
all right

5679.199 --> 5681.919999999999
i'm not just gonna

5683.28 --> 5688.84
share every freaking detail thanks

5700.48 --> 5704.48
ouch

5701.52 --> 5706.88
classical homeopath that's that's really

5704.48 --> 5706.879999999999
gross

5707.119 --> 5710.119
dude

5724.239 --> 5729.5599999999995
tried so many ways but being yourself is

5726.08 --> 5729.5599999999995
the best right

5731.119 --> 5734.719
well look

5732.48 --> 5734.718999999999
it's

5735.679 --> 5741.36
it's all about getting used to it

5739.04 --> 5744.96
right and i think that out there there

5741.36 --> 5746.719
are probably quite a few women

5744.96 --> 5748.0
that have seen me and that are

5746.719 --> 5752.2390000000005
interested

5748.0 --> 5752.239
it's just that is that mutual

5752.88 --> 5758.96
right because almost everybody out there

5755.92 --> 5761.84
is just completely absorbed by all kinds

5758.96 --> 5766.2390000000005
of forms of mind control

5761.84 --> 5766.2390000000005
that i utterly reject

5767.52 --> 5771.1990000000005
and if yeah

5768.96 --> 5772.96
if there are certain

5771.199 --> 5774.5599999999995
typical behaviors slipped in there then

5772.96 --> 5776.0
they're going to try to manipulate that

5774.56 --> 5778.159000000001
sort of [ __ ] they're going to try to

5776.0 --> 5781.28
make me different i

5778.159 --> 5783.44
it's totally unacceptable

5781.28 --> 5786.96
unless it is different in a way that i

5783.44 --> 5786.96
want to be different

5792.4 --> 5795.839999999999
which i agree to that i should improve

5794.4 --> 5798.239
that right that sort of thing that

5795.84 --> 5800.08
that's different but

5798.239 --> 5801.839999999999
dude we'll just

5800.08 --> 5805.159
eventually

5801.84 --> 5805.159000000001
it'll happen

5819.52 --> 5826.56
aren't you yourself guilty of coercing

5822.4 --> 5828.96
others into my mind control what i'm

5826.56 --> 5828.96
sorry

5829.04 --> 5833.6
i'm i'm sorry i didn't know you were

5831.119 --> 5837.44
mandated to come here and follow my

5833.6 --> 5839.6
instructions rick montgomery

5837.44 --> 5842.638999999999
the hell is this coercing others into

5839.6 --> 5846.400000000001
mind control about like am i forcing you

5842.639 --> 5848.56
to watch this and to do as i say

5846.4 --> 5850.719
or is it voluntary based and you can

5848.56 --> 5852.2390000000005
literally walk away if you don't want to

5850.719 --> 5854.4
do what i say

5852.239 --> 5856.08
or you can't handle it

5854.4 --> 5858.32
at the time

5856.08 --> 5861.719
no need to apologize what the hell is

5858.32 --> 5861.719
wrong with you

5874.639 --> 5878.56
uh

5876.159 --> 5883.679
what is your point

5878.56 --> 5886.56
exactly what exactly i completely

5883.679 --> 5888.8
defused your statement

5886.56 --> 5890.719
my guilt over coercing others into mind

5888.8 --> 5892.320000000001
control that isn't happening yeah

5890.719 --> 5895.52
exactly i know

5892.32 --> 5897.199
nobody is fortunate forcing me to watch

5895.52 --> 5899.84
forcing to watch

5897.199 --> 5902.879999999999
what i do here yeah so that completely

5899.84 --> 5905.88
negates everything you said yes i know

5902.88 --> 5905.88
exactly

5927.92 --> 5933.1990000000005
i mean do you feel i mind controlling

5930.08 --> 5935.199
you are you longing for that

5933.199 --> 5938.759999999999
would you like to be mind controlled by

5935.199 --> 5938.759999999999
me rick montgomery

5945.04 --> 5948.44
because you're here

5953.44 --> 5957.5199999999995
i mean i could give it a go you know

5958.8 --> 5963.4400000000005
is there something specific you want to

5960.56 --> 5966.679
be mind controlled about tell me i'll do

5963.44 --> 5966.678999999999
my best

5981.6 --> 5985.1990000000005
that i am not susceptible to

5986.239 --> 5990.08
that's not what i said

5987.84 --> 5994.96
did i say i'm not susceptible to it no

5990.08 --> 5997.44
i'm set i'm unwilling to engage in that

5994.96 --> 5998.88
if it would literally just deflect off

5997.44 --> 6000.799999999999
me and i'd be like yeah yeah say

5998.88 --> 6004.0
whatever it doesn't matter

6000.8 --> 6005.92
then i would probably have less issues

6004.0 --> 6008.48
going out there and communicating with

6005.92 --> 6010.639
random people because then the mind

6008.48 --> 6012.0
control attempts from their side

6010.639 --> 6013.76
wouldn't be

6012.0 --> 6015.28
getting in my way they wouldn't be like

6013.76 --> 6016.8
a burden to me

6015.28 --> 6020.4
they kind of are

6016.8 --> 6022.159000000001
i find it very disturbing

6020.4 --> 6023.28
when i see that behavior from other

6022.159 --> 6027.44
people

6023.28 --> 6027.44
that was the point of me bringing it up

6030.32 --> 6034.759999999999
yes pj crew shank i know

6036.96 --> 6040.639
right but even if you were that's your

6039.119 --> 6042.239
choice

6040.639 --> 6044.0
right

6042.239 --> 6046.638999999999
if you choose

6044.0 --> 6048.719
to trust me to control your mind then

6046.639 --> 6051.6
that's your prerogative and hey i'll be

6048.719 --> 6054.08
a good mind controller i'm very generous

6051.6 --> 6055.84
i'm a good king

6054.08 --> 6057.84
you know

6055.84 --> 6060.08
but yeah you

6057.84 --> 6062.88
are probably very well aware that you

6060.08 --> 6065.36
could just disagree with me too and step

6062.88 --> 6067.4400000000005
away you know if you're like i totally

6065.36 --> 6070.48
disagree with how arwyn handled that

6067.44 --> 6072.4
situation i'm personally cranked by it

6070.48 --> 6075.839999999999
i'm just gonna say okay screw it i'm

6072.4 --> 6078.96
just not gonna come here for a week

6075.84 --> 6081.4400000000005
you could do that right so even as i am

6078.96 --> 6083.44
mind controlling you i give you all this

6081.44 --> 6085.04
freedom to actually step away from the

6083.44 --> 6087.599999999999
mind control

6085.04 --> 6090.88
so that you will afterward come back now

6087.6 --> 6093.84
that's the real my module

6090.88 --> 6093.84
just kidding

6102.96 --> 6106.159
right

6104.719 --> 6109.52
if you want to be mind controlled i

6106.159 --> 6109.5199999999995
could try you know

6110.88 --> 6118.56
but yeah it takes two to be mind control

6115.119 --> 6118.5599999999995
you have to actually want it

6118.96 --> 6122.159
hey jose

6126.0 --> 6128.239
ah

6132.0 --> 6136.88
good to see it's not just your entire ip

6134.32 --> 6139.84
address having been banned

6136.88 --> 6139.84
or shadow band

6140.48 --> 6144.959999999999
well yeah i see you in chat jose flip

6143.52 --> 6146.719
flop

6144.96 --> 6149.719
annoying name by the way but i don't

6146.719 --> 6149.719
care

6149.76 --> 6154.4800000000005
jg account didn't work dude i've shown

6152.48 --> 6157.44
you right i've shown you yesterday on

6154.48 --> 6160.239
your show my my actual screen you

6157.44 --> 6161.599999999999
weren't in there i i don't know why

6160.239 --> 6163.44
it's weird

6161.6 --> 6166.320000000001
i feel like there's this weird shadow

6163.44 --> 6168.239
banning thing going on out there

6166.32 --> 6173.32
like people are being put on list and

6168.239 --> 6173.32
banned and nobody can reach those lists

6178.56 --> 6182.96
it feels like secret social engineering

6181.28 --> 6184.5599999999995
manipulation

6182.96 --> 6186.08
like they're just deciding like you

6184.56 --> 6188.080000000001
can't go there and there and there

6186.08 --> 6191.6
because that would

6188.08 --> 6193.84
make you become less predictable

6191.6 --> 6193.84
right

6193.92 --> 6198.56
can keep you compartmentalized if we

6196.0 --> 6201.679
could just allow you to go and visit and

6198.56 --> 6201.679
communicate everywhere

6203.679 --> 6208.4
but anyway yeah you're here with the

6205.679 --> 6208.4
other account

6209.36 --> 6213.679
nobody freaking ban him don't you dare

6215.6 --> 6220.88
i didn't do anything to get banned so

6218.639 --> 6220.88
right

6222.88 --> 6226.8
ah right steamy traveler yeah see you

6224.719 --> 6228.61
later sorry i got too personal all right

6226.8 --> 6230.08
that's okay

6228.61 --> 6234.5599999999995
[Music]

6230.08 --> 6234.5599999999995
thank you for recognizing it that's good

6237.119 --> 6240.799999999999
yeah it was good having you in the chat

6241.92 --> 6246.0
so yeah i hope to see you again tomorrow

6244.159 --> 6248.5599999999995
i'm gonna be rounding out in about like

6246.0 --> 6248.56
10 minutes

6259.76 --> 6262.08
all right

6269.119 --> 6273.04
it happens to flat side hmm

6273.28 --> 6275.84
wow

6276.8 --> 6281.88
okay i didn't know about that that's

6278.48 --> 6281.879999999999
that's weird

6306.8 --> 6309.84
uh thanks that flat fellow i appreciate

6308.719 --> 6313.76
that

6309.84 --> 6316.0
this was about a month ago yes i i yeah

6313.76 --> 6318.96
well that's also when the weird stuff

6316.0 --> 6318.96
kind of started up

6319.52 --> 6324.159000000001
that i've taken note of

6321.36 --> 6326.719
with google so yeah that makes sense

6324.159 --> 6328.879999999999
like something was altered like the way

6326.719 --> 6330.8
the search results even roll out in

6328.88 --> 6334.719
certain circumstances

6330.8 --> 6337.04
is very different it's like

6334.719 --> 6339.6
in some cases it seems like google just

6337.04 --> 6341.84
isn't trying to help you find the right

6339.6 --> 6344.0
answer anymore it's just trying to give

6341.84 --> 6346.4800000000005
you an answer that it wants you to

6344.0 --> 6346.48
pursue

6347.199 --> 6350.638999999999
and that's not just oh

6349.04 --> 6353.199
you're gonna have to believe this

6350.639 --> 6354.88
mainstream media not even like that it's

6353.199 --> 6356.5599999999995
more like

6354.88 --> 6359.4400000000005
you're searching for something and it's

6356.56 --> 6362.0
literally making you bend away from that

6359.44 --> 6363.36
search from finding the result and deep

6362.0 --> 6365.92
making you

6363.36 --> 6368.4
start thinking about other things

6365.92 --> 6370.4
through research result exposure that's

6368.4 --> 6373.36
something that i've noticed it's really

6370.4 --> 6376.5599999999995
creepy this is like straight out social

6373.36 --> 6380.239
engineering very creepy

6376.56 --> 6380.2390000000005
and that's just with search results

6382.719 --> 6390.0
alright see you later rastad

6386.48 --> 6390.0
nice service day you're late

6390.96 --> 6393.76
welcome anyway

6397.199 --> 6400.199
what

6422.96 --> 6426.679
and bulk [ __ ]

6434.0 --> 6438.08
it's intention dude

6436.48 --> 6441.44
pj krishan

6438.08 --> 6444.4
it has to be intentional there is no way

6441.44 --> 6446.08
that this happened randomly not a chance

6444.4 --> 6449.44
in hell

6446.08 --> 6452.08
like changing the entire

6449.44 --> 6454.08
prerogative like

6452.08 --> 6456.32
that doesn't naturally happen the

6454.08 --> 6459.36
algorithm just doesn't just change

6456.32 --> 6459.36
itself like that

6459.6 --> 6462.8
after not having done that for a long

6461.92 --> 6464.56
time

6462.8 --> 6467.119000000001
it had to be

6464.56 --> 6469.92
reset with the new

6467.119 --> 6471.28
motivation yeah the new objective

6469.92 --> 6473.4400000000005
priorities

6471.28 --> 6476.239
had to be there's no way in hell that

6473.44 --> 6478.799999999999
could have naturally happened by itself

6476.239 --> 6482.44
not a chance in hell

6478.8 --> 6482.4400000000005
absolutely not

6493.44 --> 6498.239
had a late night all right this is okay

6496.719 --> 6500.159
don't worry about it it was a really

6498.239 --> 6502.5599999999995
good show though so

6500.159 --> 6504.879999999999
i brought in a new concept

6502.56 --> 6507.4400000000005
to try well like the title figuring out

6504.88 --> 6510.92
the holographic sun how the holographic

6507.44 --> 6510.919999999999
sun really works

6517.44 --> 6521.678999999999
maybe i should just call it the

6519.119 --> 6523.839999999999
holographic nature of the sun

6521.679 --> 6527.159
i think that would make a better title

6523.84 --> 6527.159000000001
doing that

6534.82 --> 6540.228999999999
[Applause]

6563.76 --> 6570.159000000001
i'll always look at it as a light in the

6567.84 --> 6572.2390000000005
sky

6570.159 --> 6574.48
right

6572.239 --> 6574.48
well

6575.44 --> 6580.799999999999
yeah just just watch it back

6578.239 --> 6583.759999999999
like it it came spontaneous to me it's

6580.8 --> 6585.599
like somebody made kind of a

6583.76 --> 6587.679
weird statement

6585.599 --> 6589.92
and i read something else into it and

6587.679 --> 6590.88
like the whole idea sprang forth from

6589.92 --> 6593.52
that

6590.88 --> 6597.76
it's very typical very arwen somebody

6593.52 --> 6599.679
says something that's like not

6597.76 --> 6600.4800000000005
and then i see something else because of

6599.679 --> 6603.36
that

6600.48 --> 6603.36
it's very difficult

6606.96 --> 6611.04
what proof have you got of a holographic

6609.52 --> 6613.76
son well

6611.04 --> 6616.08
i rest my case with the holographic

6613.76 --> 6618.320000000001
nature based on the complete

6616.08 --> 6619.92
lack of proof of a euclidean nature

6618.32 --> 6621.199
there's no

6619.92 --> 6625.28
perspective

6621.199 --> 6627.759999999999
changes which objects in locations would

6625.28 --> 6630.159
require to have

6627.76 --> 6632.4800000000005
there's no angular size change during

6630.159 --> 6635.5199999999995
its path

6632.48 --> 6635.5199999999995
its apparent path

6637.28 --> 6642.159
it doesn't seem like it's approachable

6639.28 --> 6644.88
it even seems to move with you

6642.159 --> 6647.598999999999
like to your intuition tells you it

6644.88 --> 6649.28
moves with you as you move right

6647.599 --> 6652.96
same goes for the moon like that sort of

6649.28 --> 6654.719
thing on an intuitive level

6652.96 --> 6656.2390000000005
it seems holographic

6654.719 --> 6657.199
and

6656.239 --> 6659.919999999999
once you

6657.199 --> 6662.239
relinquish once you let go of the ideas

6659.92 --> 6664.639
it has to be things at specific super

6662.239 --> 6667.04
far distances all that on intuitive

6664.639 --> 6669.599
level yeah it does seem holographic to

6667.04 --> 6672.48
me and i'm not the only one

6669.599 --> 6674.2390000000005
and yeah the perspective issues

6672.48 --> 6676.718999999999
there's no angular size change during

6674.239 --> 6677.678999999999
its course

6676.719 --> 6679.44
and

6677.679 --> 6682.08
yeah

6679.44 --> 6685.28
where's the icarus project

6682.08 --> 6687.92
where's the rocket or something flying

6685.28 --> 6690.08
straight at its apparent

6687.92 --> 6692.4
location

6690.08 --> 6694.719
or its assumed position based on a disk

6692.4 --> 6697.759999999999
model at that specific height let's see

6694.719 --> 6700.4
it approach let's see as you approach it

6697.76 --> 6703.4400000000005
things change

6700.4 --> 6705.119
in direct relation to what you would

6703.44 --> 6705.919999999999
expect

6705.119 --> 6707.679
like

6705.92 --> 6708.8
you're approaching it the light should

6707.679 --> 6710.0
grow

6708.8 --> 6712.719
faster

6710.0 --> 6715.119
if it's an object this angular size

6712.719 --> 6717.36
should become bigger

6715.119 --> 6718.48
the energy output should

6717.36 --> 6721.199
increase

6718.48 --> 6723.759999999999
as you approach it right all those types

6721.199 --> 6724.879999999999
of elements there's no evidence for this

6723.76 --> 6727.280000000001
at all

6724.88 --> 6730.32
and the complete lack of evidence

6727.28 --> 6733.599
in that region is also for me kind of an

6730.32 --> 6736.4
anchor point to assume it's holographic

6733.599 --> 6739.4400000000005
so i don't have any direct

6736.4 --> 6741.759999999999
like scientifically viable evidence

6739.44 --> 6744.0
but due to a complete lack

6741.76 --> 6746.2390000000005
of evidence for a physical nature i am

6744.0 --> 6748.96
assuming as an alternative that it has

6746.239 --> 6753.159
to be holographic

6748.96 --> 6753.159
that's how that is

6772.48 --> 6776.32
bree

6774.08 --> 6776.32
look

6776.639 --> 6782.159000000001
did yeah concerning the apparent shadow

6780.32 --> 6784.32
banning people not being able to

6782.159 --> 6785.839999999999
communicate on channels without actually

6784.32 --> 6790.159
having been blocked

6785.84 --> 6790.159000000001
who's to say that's a.i doing that

6791.76 --> 6796.719
that's not necessarily the case it could

6794.4 --> 6801.679
literally be some kind of weird shadow

6796.719 --> 6801.679
banning council secret moderators

6801.92 --> 6805.76
that are like unregistered unofficial

6804.0 --> 6808.56
and they just do that with certain

6805.76 --> 6809.84
objectives it could be people secretly

6808.56 --> 6811.76
doing that

6809.84 --> 6813.679
unofficially

6811.76 --> 6814.8
why would it have to be an algorithm

6813.679 --> 6818.28
doing that

6814.8 --> 6818.28
how do you know

6828.159 --> 6832.4
how does a hologram make things hot and

6830.159 --> 6833.36
warm well through the absorption of the

6832.4 --> 6834.879999999999
light

6833.36 --> 6837.5199999999995
that reaches you

6834.88 --> 6839.84
and if that light intensity

6837.52 --> 6841.4400000000005
is very high then you will see the

6839.84 --> 6843.28
hologram

6841.44 --> 6845.598999999999
but also

6843.28 --> 6849.44
get all that heat

6845.599 --> 6852.4800000000005
from it yeah a hologram

6849.44 --> 6855.36
actually can exert heat especially well

6852.48 --> 6858.4
if you use

6855.36 --> 6860.239
lamps that have heat in them

6858.4 --> 6862.159
as a source for the creation of the

6860.239 --> 6863.678999999999
hologram

6862.159 --> 6866.239
so that's how

6863.679 --> 6868.8
yeah holograms can make things hot

6866.239 --> 6868.799999999999
that's right

6869.44 --> 6873.4
it is technically possible

6882.88 --> 6887.679
experiment for proof

6885.28 --> 6890.08
oh right no no well why don't you just

6887.679 --> 6892.0
give me a couple of hundred thousand so

6890.08 --> 6895.04
that i can actually

6892.0 --> 6897.04
buy and build a hologram device just so

6895.04 --> 6900.0
i can prove that to you

6897.04 --> 6902.32
alright or you could do it yourself

6900.0 --> 6902.32
you know

6903.04 --> 6907.599
i mean or

6904.48 --> 6910.638999999999
just try to prove the contrary

6907.599 --> 6912.08
about the sun that it isn't

6910.639 --> 6914.400000000001
holographic right oh it's not

6912.08 --> 6916.639
holographic it will freaking deliver the

6914.4 --> 6918.5599999999995
evidence then let's see that approach of

6916.639 --> 6920.8
the sun let's see the angular size

6918.56 --> 6923.360000000001
change let's see it happen let's see the

6920.8 --> 6925.599
energy output growing bigger as you

6923.36 --> 6928.48
approach in any form

6925.599 --> 6930.88
in any form let's do that

6928.48 --> 6934.32
all right

6930.88 --> 6938.52
until then i rest my case

6934.32 --> 6938.5199999999995
based on the available evidence

6948.08 --> 6952.8
jose there's no such thing as

6949.679 --> 6952.8
responsible trolling

6955.599 --> 6958.159000000001
but

6957.119 --> 6960.48
yeah

6958.159 --> 6961.44
just don't spam and everything will be

6960.48 --> 6963.36
all right

6961.44 --> 6965.28
hey and maybe you could even

6963.36 --> 6966.88
jump in the conversation and make a

6965.28 --> 6968.4
point about it that would that would be

6966.88 --> 6971.28
cool because if you'd actually

6968.4 --> 6974.28
contribute something

6971.28 --> 6974.28
uh

6976.0 --> 6980.88
the sun gets smaller when it moves away

6978.08 --> 6984.159
from you though no it doesn't

6980.88 --> 6986.159000000001
no it doesn't service day it doesn't

6984.159 --> 6987.5199999999995
it doesn't get smaller when it moves

6986.159 --> 6990.239
away ever

6987.52 --> 6992.8
right there's sightings of the sun

6990.239 --> 6995.199
like hitting that horizon

6992.8 --> 6998.639
and then oh it gets it seems to get

6995.199 --> 7002.0
smaller yeah yeah the angular speed

6998.639 --> 7004.159000000001
isn't altering as it is growing smaller

7002.0 --> 7006.56
now if you apply the laws of perspective

7004.159 --> 7009.199
to that that would imply that the sun

7006.56 --> 7011.280000000001
suddenly starts increasing in speed and

7009.199 --> 7013.04
shooting off at warp speed into the

7011.28 --> 7016.639
distance

7013.04 --> 7019.28
yeah i've seen those fits too it's a

7016.639 --> 7022.639
mistake it cannot

7019.28 --> 7025.5199999999995
be growing smaller apparently because it

7022.639 --> 7028.639
is going into the distance because then

7025.52 --> 7030.4800000000005
it suddenly would increase speed in

7028.639 --> 7032.639
relation to that that makes no sense

7030.48 --> 7034.799999999999
because it doesn't do that the speed is

7032.639 --> 7036.639
constant everywhere

7034.8 --> 7039.04
doesn't match up

7036.639 --> 7040.88
it has to be an optical effect that it

7039.04 --> 7044.88
seems to grow smaller probably some kind

7040.88 --> 7046.56
of lensing it doesn't actually grow

7044.88 --> 7048.56
smaller because it's moving into the

7046.56 --> 7051.84
distance because then

7048.56 --> 7054.96
the angular speed of it moving into the

7051.84 --> 7057.92
distance would decrease because things

7054.96 --> 7060.08
physical things moving into the distance

7057.92 --> 7061.76
start decreasing

7060.08 --> 7064.4
apparent

7061.76 --> 7066.320000000001
also known as angular speed that's what

7064.4 --> 7068.5599999999995
happens to things moving into the

7066.32 --> 7071.679
distance sun doesn't do that

7068.56 --> 7073.280000000001
the angular speed is constant even as it

7071.679 --> 7075.52
suddenly grows smaller the speed is

7073.28 --> 7077.5199999999995
constant it's not actually going off in

7075.52 --> 7078.96
warp speed so the conclusion would have

7077.52 --> 7080.96
to be

7078.96 --> 7083.119
it's not growing smaller because it's

7080.96 --> 7084.88
going into the distance because then the

7083.119 --> 7085.679
angular speed

7084.88 --> 7087.679
would

7085.679 --> 7091.28
decrease as that process would be

7087.679 --> 7091.28
happening and it isn't ever

7093.76 --> 7099.96
and i've been making this argument for

7095.599 --> 7099.96
over five years by the way

7107.36 --> 7111.119
right anyway i'm rounding out the show

7109.36 --> 7113.28
it's been a full two-hour show a great

7111.119 --> 7113.28
one

7113.36 --> 7118.4
so thanks everyone for coming i hope you

7116.48 --> 7120.879999999999
liked this show if you did then please

7118.4 --> 7121.759999999999
don't forget to rogan's it up or

7120.88 --> 7123.84
dude

7121.76 --> 7126.320000000001
or you've rogan sit down if you're an

7123.84 --> 7128.88
[ __ ] or some kind of weird shadow

7126.32 --> 7130.96
banning console

7128.88 --> 7133.36
that's supposed to be forming public

7130.96 --> 7137.04
opinion somehow through the

7133.36 --> 7139.119
the manipulation of this nonsense

7137.04 --> 7141.679
i don't really care right

7139.119 --> 7145.04
if you did like it then brokens it up

7141.679 --> 7146.2390000000005
that's all that really matters to me

7145.04 --> 7147.04
right

7146.239 --> 7148.959999999999
uh

7147.04 --> 7150.56
and also if you haven't already

anyway yeah please also do support me

7161.76 --> 7165.280000000001
through the paypal patreon crypto wallet

7163.76 --> 7166.96
super chat and the membership system

7165.28 --> 7169.119
join button that will be much

7166.96 --> 7171.84
appreciated you can definitely still use

7169.119 --> 7171.839999999999
it

7173.36 --> 7178.4
i mean i'm getting around right now very

7175.84 --> 7180.32
lucky to have the paypal donations from

7178.4 --> 7182.239
like the last few days roll in very

7180.32 --> 7184.48
quickly otherwise i wouldn't be able to

7182.239 --> 7186.5599999999995
buy food today

7184.48 --> 7189.04
right i'm not completely out of the

7186.56 --> 7192.88
woods yet so please keep it coming

7189.04 --> 7192.88
if you can if you can afford it

7193.199 --> 7195.44
oh

7196.639 --> 7200.159000000001
ha

7197.44 --> 7202.5599999999995
yeah thanks i did actually get a paypal

7200.159 --> 7204.5599999999995
from that flat fellow again small one

7202.56 --> 7208.320000000001
but that's cool

7204.56 --> 7209.280000000001
thank you very much that was unexpected

7208.32 --> 7211.5199999999995

7209.28 --> 7211.5199999999995
so

7211.679 --> 7215.92
anyway

7214.0 --> 7219.199
i'm gonna join the flat earth debates it

7215.92 --> 7221.4400000000005
should be already started up

7219.199 --> 7221.44
and

7221.52 --> 7227.1990000000005
