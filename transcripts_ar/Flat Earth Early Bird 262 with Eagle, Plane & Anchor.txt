little bit worse there's a lot of rain

79.899 --> 90.57
and a lot of very dark clouds although

86.17 --> 93.1
right now it's not raining but that's

90.57 --> 95.28999999999999
yeah and I only stopped raining like 15

93.1 --> 100.229
minutes ago because be mostly raining

95.29 --> 104.97900000000001
all day I had to get a new umbrella

129.66 --> 140.63
herbal Sun monkey 3d mozzarellas mist

134.63 --> 146.19
Steve ego playing anchor of course I

140.63 --> 149.37
kill the hope Jason Cormac drunken

146.19 --> 152.66
bullet for one one Jeffrey Bale the mise

149.37 --> 166.26
Kang Amanda young

152.66 --> 169.53
yeah good to see you all so I yep I got

166.26 --> 171.92999999999998
with me by the way just II know Tamara

169.53 --> 175.23
coffee a banana I don't even know if I'm

171.93 --> 180.06
gonna eat that and sort of like a

175.23 --> 182.31
chocolate fruit bar and water that's it

180.06 --> 188.4
I have to be kind of careful with my

182.31 --> 191.01
stomach maybe it's also the weather but

188.4 --> 192.079
and by the way something that has been

191.01 --> 196.25
helping me a lot

192.079 --> 202.11
it's funny to remember this stuff is

196.25 --> 206.22
this lubos halo earth

202.11 --> 210.239
it's basically clay and it works really

206.22 --> 214.53
well just put a bit of clay add water

210.239 --> 218.79
good filtered water I take it and or any

214.53 --> 220.62
stomach acid kind of reflux thing or be

218.79 --> 225.9
even know she ate it just goes away

220.62 --> 232.32
pretty quickly so what's happened to

225.9 --> 235.5
stomach well I think it's an overall

232.32 --> 238.04
tension thing and well my dad and my

235.5 --> 242.1
heater both seem to agree upon that it's

238.04 --> 243.959
related to a they approach it through

242.1 --> 246.89
the German new medicine as saying that

243.959 --> 246.89000000000001
it has to do with

248.97 --> 259.11
me settling in this new well role or

255.17 --> 260.64
doing this getting from out of a

259.11 --> 262.62
position where I would live was

260.64 --> 263.03999999999996
literally doing absolutely nothing at

262.62 --> 266.1
all

263.04 --> 268.20000000000005
so taking upon this task resolved a

266.1 --> 270.42
certain conflict that was localized in

268.2 --> 274.02
my stomach it has everything to do with

270.42 --> 277.02000000000004
earthing so even the natural effects of

274.02 --> 281.63
the Spirit versus the body tie into that

277.02 --> 285.39
and so my stomach is a little bit more

281.63 --> 288.0
feeble feels like not really bad though

285.39 --> 290.25
I still drink some beers here and there

288.0 --> 297.99
and I can still handle it but it's just

290.25 --> 300.93
I don't know I thought at first it maybe

297.99 --> 304.71000000000004
is like a side effect of being exposed

300.93 --> 309.69
to falling in love hormones which could

304.71 --> 313.02
be part of it I know that I responded

309.69 --> 315.54
really badly to that for me falling in

313.02 --> 319.53
love is usually like oh my god I'm gonna

315.54 --> 322.95000000000005
die again because that's how it tends to

319.53 --> 326.82
feel at first it's just too bad too much

322.95 --> 333.45
it overwhelms my system a lot that's I

326.82 --> 337.40999999999997
tend to not really like it but yeah I

333.45 --> 339.39
went over to my friend with who has a

337.41 --> 341.04
daughter of two years old I explained

339.39 --> 346.97999999999996
that that was last Saturday and that

341.04 --> 350.51000000000005
really made a big impact on me so there

346.98 --> 352.56
are some feeling issues that need to be

350.51 --> 354.87
resolved and worked on but that's

352.56 --> 358.53000000000003
separately that's just adding more to

354.87 --> 360.54
the tension that's all so but yeah just

358.53 --> 364.59
my my stomach is a little wonky

360.54 --> 371.87
that's all doing fine

364.59 --> 374.48999999999995
oh good Steve yeah that's thank you

371.87 --> 380.88
that's really what I needed to hear

374.49 --> 382.889
thanks a lot although I guess there is a

380.88 --> 385.71
direct relevance to it and I'm by the

382.889 --> 389.85
way I'm gonna call you up ego plane and

385.71 --> 397.32
anchor but yes I have a very bad feeling

389.85 --> 400.11
about what's gonna be unfolding with

397.32 --> 402.9
Flat Earth I feel like the water the

400.11 --> 410.63
well is being poisoned and it's

402.9 --> 413.52
spreading and I'm not talking about

410.63 --> 416.99
behavioral situations because those have

413.52 --> 423.15
always been issues now I'm talking about

416.99 --> 425.31
like intellectual integrity poisoning

423.15 --> 428.669
after well it's just terrible

425.31 --> 434.63
anyway I'm gonna see if I can call up

428.669 --> 437.63
you'll plant an anchor find him first oh

434.63 --> 437.63
yeah

439.17 --> 445.17
can you say hello in the Skype chat so I

442.33 --> 445.16999999999996
can find you

452.84 --> 467.61999999999995
I have a lot of people Skype

458.69 --> 467.62
Oh Matt curry all right

472.19 --> 475.54
a little

475.92 --> 484.3
hello hello hey Aaron how's it going

480.33 --> 487.69
yeah I'm doing okay being better but

484.3 --> 489.46000000000004
doing fine how's the sound I'm just want

487.69 --> 494.02
to make sure I don't fix anything I

489.46 --> 496.63
think it's alright I just yeah

494.02 --> 498.46
pulled some livers levers I think it's

496.63 --> 500.17
alright now there may be a little bit of

498.46 --> 502.0
echo but there's nothing I can do about

500.17 --> 505.18
it really but you're coming through loud

502.0 --> 507.37
and clear to me at least cool man cool

505.18 --> 510.1
yeah man I just want I feel bad I wanted

507.37 --> 512.38
to let you know that you know I can see

510.1 --> 515.65
how you were feeling with the whole

512.38 --> 517.66
Spurs and the Randy situation and like

515.65 --> 523.9
you're not the only one that felt that

517.66 --> 526.78
way I've been like ringing the bell the

523.9 --> 530.26
Town Square Bell about it from the start

526.78 --> 534.9
pretty loudly and I'm just seeing people

530.26 --> 542.3199999999999
subtly one by one switch to that side

534.9 --> 544.09
like there's a revolution going on you

542.32 --> 546.2800000000001
gave some good examples of like what

544.09 --> 548.0500000000001
what the reason for their behavior the

546.28 --> 550.0899999999999
possible reason I mean I think you're

548.05 --> 552.04
empathic like I am or you have a lot of

550.09 --> 553.7800000000001
empathy and I mean all we can do is

552.04 --> 555.67
really parachute you know try to put

553.78 --> 558.1899999999999
ourselves in their shoes and project our

555.67 --> 559.3
own behavior and and really I have no

558.19 --> 563.86
idea because you and I would never

559.3 --> 566.41
behave that way you know well I might at

563.86 --> 568.9300000000001
some point maybe like as a joke or

566.41 --> 571.66
something you know yeah but I wouldn't

568.93 --> 579.1899999999999
make it like a mission and literally go

571.66 --> 582.67
everywhere and do that yeah it creeps me

579.19 --> 584.44
out ya know even when you were on your

582.67 --> 585.64
whole our winni and gravity bit you know

584.44 --> 586.45
I didn't necessarily agree with you but

585.64 --> 591.37
you weren't out you weren't behaving

586.45 --> 593.44
this way yeah I was passionate but I was

591.37 --> 597.48
trying to be honest with myself it was

593.44 --> 601.9300000000001
yeah it was my own personal mission and

597.48 --> 604.03
I did get somewhere so I did get a an

601.93 --> 606.39
actual result from that process so I

604.03 --> 608.98
don't feel a shame that I even did it

606.39 --> 615.3389999999999
it's just yeah I was natural

608.98 --> 616.75
was part of my development yeah that's

615.339 --> 618.4590000000001
for the other thing I don't think like

616.75 --> 619.209
Randy's trying to learn something I

618.459 --> 623.8
think they've already made up their

619.209 --> 632.459
minds the way they're talking in a sense

623.8 --> 636.449
but it feels like it it just feels like

632.459 --> 642.04
it doesn't feel like himself anymore

636.449 --> 643.209
like how I remember him yeah yeah it's

642.04 --> 645.579
disappointing but it's one that like I

643.209 --> 649.4799999999999
ira unsubscribe from him too I mean it

645.579 --> 650.769
would take a lot of like you know and

649.48 --> 652.36
make it up for it I don't think he can

650.769 --> 653.589
I'm just like I I don't want anything to

652.36 --> 655.9300000000001
do it this type of person I will never

653.589 --> 657.399
I'll never behave that way and I you

655.93 --> 661.2399999999999
know I just I just don't I don't like it

657.399 --> 663.399
it's it's look the why I hadn't

661.24 --> 668.399
subscribed it's really more personal

663.399 --> 670.87
it's like if he wouldn't have like

668.399 --> 674.019
psychologically try to attack me like

670.87 --> 676.6
all right what if he didn't try to guess

674.019 --> 678.61
like me about this then I would never I

676.6 --> 681.76
would have just been like yeah rent he's

678.61 --> 683.019
doing his thing but it's well were you

681.76 --> 684.31
in the chat yesterday during the

683.019 --> 686.139
premiere for the whole thing because I

684.31 --> 687.79
was going back and forth with Randy and

686.139 --> 690.85
I mean he pissed me off because he was

687.79 --> 692.05
saying things like showing your muscles

690.85 --> 693.22
are when like he's you know he's

692.05 --> 695.29
provoking you from behind the computer

693.22 --> 700.779
and that's just that's just stupid

695.29 --> 706.3499999999999
you know I will show my muscles hey I

700.779 --> 706.35
got your back man I'm I'm 65 230 pounds

708.81 --> 712.569
yeah we would have to do anything he

711.73 --> 716.1700000000001
would probably just run away

712.569 --> 721.54
so okay good good to keep in mind I must

716.17 --> 723.0999999999999
be five foot seven but yeah I was I was

721.54 --> 726.31
in the Marine Corps I enlisted ten

723.1 --> 727.899
months before 9/11 and I was in in the

726.31 --> 728.7399999999999
Fallujah battle and my sergeant would

727.899 --> 730.93
tell me every day

728.74 --> 738.25
corporal curry you're a big effing

730.93 --> 740.4699999999999
target you know that but oh yeah okay I

738.25 --> 741.76
wanted to tell you another time because

740.47 --> 742.63
I know you're getting kind of bummed out

741.76 --> 747.22
or

742.63 --> 748.51
and way chewy was was talking to you and

747.22 --> 751.99
I just kind of want to give my

748.51 --> 755.29
perspective on that and just just the

751.99 --> 757.0600000000001
way he talks to people it's when it's

755.29 --> 758.41
almost natural for us to talk that way

757.06 --> 760.0899999999999
and we because you don't have time to

758.41 --> 761.8
have your feelings hurt or people or

760.09 --> 764.71
we're not sensitive it's just normal

761.8 --> 766.42
right and he I don't think he's poorly

764.71 --> 769.09
aware that he's always doing that it's

766.42 --> 770.29
just it's so second nature to behave

769.09 --> 773.77
that way and talk to people that way

770.29 --> 777.0999999999999
when you're from the military maybe but

773.77 --> 780.85
it's like he's hiding behind it it's an

777.1 --> 784.72
act it's his it's ex personal character

780.85 --> 790.8100000000001
act yeah and I don't know what it is it

784.72 --> 794.26
has a weird smell off like a shortness

790.81 --> 795.55
behind it they like questions yeah

794.26 --> 797.35
certain questions get him really

795.55 --> 801.03
triggered you can tell there's some of

797.35 --> 805.69
these hi no absolutely no but he

801.03 --> 808.24
responds to things he strategize these

805.69 --> 811.3900000000001
strategical response to things is based

808.24 --> 815.83
on how he feels about that particular

811.39 --> 818.98
subject or region knowledge which was

815.83 --> 821.23
very surreal to me because usually when

818.98 --> 823.57
I questioned detail when I for example

821.23 --> 825.07
questioned the natural laws and couldn't

823.57 --> 828.3100000000001
you prove that scientifically he went

825.07 --> 831.3000000000001
all-out attack like I'm stupid and all

828.31 --> 834.01
that and I later I like I said okay okay

831.3 --> 835.81
but then I started to say okay but I

834.01 --> 838.83
have issues with quantum mechanics in

835.81 --> 845.53
here and there he went all protective

838.83 --> 846.46
yeah is that you Joe yeah I mean I mean

845.53 --> 847.66
I swear to give you like some

846.46 --> 849.3100000000001
encouragement don't be I mean don't get

847.66 --> 850.54
to two down by that stuff I mean uh

849.31 --> 852.66
other people are seeing the same thing

850.54 --> 854.53
you are you're not the only one yeah I

852.66 --> 856.0899999999999
wish Nathan would have had your back a

854.53 --> 858.64
little more but I think like Jason is

856.09 --> 860.2900000000001
it's kind of like a you know kind of

858.64 --> 861.49
alienated himself in the community you

860.29 --> 864.37
know the stuff with Bob which I totally

861.49 --> 870.4300000000001
had his back about you know like Randy's

864.37 --> 874.089
like his last friend no no I I disagree

870.43 --> 876.0999999999999
I think Nathan as' has been very nice to

874.089 --> 879.7800000000001
me

876.1 --> 884.83
really yes no he's no he's just not

879.78 --> 889.15
choosing me over QE because then

884.83 --> 892.21
probably you know I was going back to

889.15 --> 896.74
Randy of course yeah qyz is uh is this

892.21 --> 901.6600000000001
guy you know right and QE has been kind

896.74 --> 905.5600000000001
of a loyal friend to Nathan Sherwin one

901.66 --> 908.26
item so so explain to drop him if I were

905.56 --> 911.26
Nathan it's just kind of disappointing

908.26 --> 913.72
to me sometimes because I really want to

911.26 --> 916.42
achieve intellectual and knowledge

913.72 --> 919.99
progress and then sometimes QE

916.42 --> 923.53
is making it into a social game all of a

919.99 --> 926.5
sudden and that that's my only real

923.53 --> 927.79
objection no I recognize that we with

926.5 --> 929.41
Brenda you're like we're wasting time

927.79 --> 932.8299999999999
we're talking to somebody who's just

929.41 --> 934.54
like a walking contradiction like I'm

932.83 --> 936.5500000000001
the same way like ma let's make some

934.54 --> 937.81
sort of progress and maybe think like

936.55 --> 940.24
our when you would hate you would never

937.81 --> 941.7099999999999
make it in the military because like I

940.24 --> 943.6
have no patience for anything after

941.71 --> 945.61
being in the military it's you know they

943.6 --> 946.03
make us like some generals getting an

945.61 --> 947.83
award

946.03 --> 949.48
well the general tells the lieutenant

947.83 --> 950.86
you know be out there eight o'clock in

949.48 --> 953.44
the morning then the lieutenant tells

950.86 --> 954.85
you know this guy sergeant major be

953.44 --> 956.2600000000001
there at seven then it keeps going down

954.85 --> 958.87
until it gets to like my rank and we're

956.26 --> 960.7
standing out there at 4:00 a.m. for like

958.87 --> 962.68
three hours you know for the stupid guy

960.7 --> 964.2700000000001
to get an award it's just nonsense I

962.68 --> 966.67
don't think you would like it one bit

964.27 --> 970.03
you know that sounds like a total waste

966.67 --> 972.03
of time yes it could we hurry up and

970.03 --> 975.13
wait that's what we do in the military

972.03 --> 977.62
no that's that sound I didn't even know

975.13 --> 981.31
about that that sounds terrible oh it's

977.62 --> 983.38
so right why did you order me to do this

981.31 --> 986.88
I have all these skills I could be doing

983.38 --> 990.18
this I would be helping with I would be

986.88 --> 992.86
probably kicked out really quickly

990.18 --> 994.66
because I'm like that after I've been in

992.86 --> 998.71
but I mean you're already like that and

994.66 --> 1003.7199999999999
I don't think it's my issue why I don't

998.71 --> 1005.25
even fit in with regular jobs oh yeah

1003.72 --> 1007.86
there isn't gonna be a lot worse of

1005.25 --> 1009.42
course you know I mean in basic training

1007.86 --> 1011.61
I mean they really teach us how to tie

1009.42 --> 1013.3499999999999
she's not kidding that's that's what

1011.61 --> 1016.73
they teach you it's you try to put your

1013.35 --> 1021.1800000000001
clothes on tie your shoes and that's it

1016.73 --> 1024.15
do it formalities and you do teach how

1021.18 --> 1026.34
to basically maintain disassemble and

1024.15 --> 1030.9
assemble your your weapon right that -

1026.34 --> 1033.09
oh yeah yeah but it's it's really

1030.9 --> 1035.1000000000001
tedious we do a lot of drill - but um

1033.09 --> 1037.47
yeah we you know the Marine Corps every

1035.1 --> 1039.6299999999999
Marine is a rifleman and so you know we

1037.47 --> 1043.08
have we have our m16s in basic training

1039.63 --> 1044.0700000000002
oh and you know we always have our wife

1043.08 --> 1049.11
with the file if you've seen the movie

1044.07 --> 1052.23
uh what was it it's the famous marine

1049.11 --> 1053.52
movie my Generation Kill but uh with our

1052.23 --> 1055.32
Lee army but you know the guy he's like

1053.52 --> 1058.61
this is my rifle this is my gun

1055.32 --> 1062.97
this is for food and this is for fun and

1058.61 --> 1065.1
well movies that but ya know did Dan

1062.97 --> 1070.83
stretch you know how the rifles like

1065.1 --> 1075.1999999999998
particles yeah this is ego played an

1070.83 --> 1077.37
anchor with me by the way yeah my name I

1075.2 --> 1079.77
my real name's Matt you call him Matt

1077.37 --> 1080.76
but uh yeah my name is it comes from

1079.77 --> 1082.35
being in the Marines

1080.76 --> 1085.53
our symbol in the Marine Corps is the

1082.35 --> 1087.6299999999999
Eagle Globe and Anchor right so I remove

1085.53 --> 1089.94
the globe and put plain because the

1087.63 --> 1092.39
earth is flat so I was just getting

1089.94 --> 1092.39
ahead of the game

1092.84 --> 1104.1499999999999
indeed flat I see your auntie using chat

1098.43 --> 1106.97
by the way Randy quit talking [ __ ] I

1104.15 --> 1110.43
think he was trying to appeal so - a

1106.97 --> 1114.69
misunderstanding or something he can uh

1110.43 --> 1116.01
I mean it's uh I just felt like it was

1114.69 --> 1117.93
just it was inappropriate he was like

1116.01 --> 1122.16
provoking you and it was just like

1117.93 --> 1122.67
baller tactic type stuff like rub me the

1122.16 --> 1127.43
wrong way

1122.67 --> 1131.5500000000002
like owe me the wrong way like Jose does

1127.43 --> 1133.8500000000001
yeah exactly like Jose does yep he's

1131.55 --> 1138.75
like really open about just being a

1133.85 --> 1141.4299999999998
troll or whatever you he's gotta find

1138.75 --> 1142.99
sometimes yeah well

1141.43 --> 1146.29
you know everyone makes their own choice

1142.99 --> 1149.6200000000001
I'm not gonna make that choice but I

1146.29 --> 1152.59
would love to have a vast group of

1149.62 --> 1154.27
people and really size up what they're

1152.59 --> 1158.5
good at what they're willing to do and

1154.27 --> 1161.47
then for example build a life think tank

1158.5 --> 1163.69
project where we're literally gonna

1161.47 --> 1166.6000000000001
design something together online over

1163.69 --> 1169.8400000000001
yeah on in air in it in a room that

1166.6 --> 1170.83
would be totally down my alley but ya

1169.84 --> 1174.1
know another thing you said yesterday

1170.83 --> 1176.83
which kind of resonated with me is is it

1174.1 --> 1182.8
does get kind of repetitive the debate

1176.83 --> 1189.73
and that kind of it just seemed a little

1182.8 --> 1194.1699999999998
more or something right well it's it's

1189.73 --> 1196.3600000000001
also I think because the real hardcore

1194.17 --> 1200.46
debates which the Flat Earth debates

1196.36 --> 1204.36
really is has been for for a while it's

1200.46 --> 1207.55
it's kind of resolved and only the total

1204.36 --> 1209.8
religious zealots keep on coming back on

1207.55 --> 1212.2
a regular basis well a lot of other

1209.8 --> 1214.36
ballers they're looking at it and

1212.2 --> 1217.45
they're probably not even gonna risk

1214.36 --> 1220.36
jumping in because they've already

1217.45 --> 1222.46
studied it and seem like oh [ __ ] yeah

1220.36 --> 1225.49
that's that's not gonna go anywhere

1222.46 --> 1228.49
and then who knows they might even you

1225.49 --> 1230.26
just show up as flat earthers at some

1228.49 --> 1232.21
point yeah another observation I mean

1230.26 --> 1233.53
it's like let the audience know - so is

1232.21 --> 1236.14
you know when you see all these trolls

1233.53 --> 1238.6299999999999
or not and like especially on Nathan's

1236.14 --> 1242.2900000000002
channel he gets just dumbest comments on

1238.63 --> 1244.8700000000001
like every channel on every robotic that

1242.29 --> 1249.36
does not receive and um a significant

1244.87 --> 1251.5
portion of popular how real people are

1249.36 --> 1253.6599999999999
you know I've only had like a top of

1251.5 --> 1255.25
friends who I've like you know even

1253.66 --> 1257.0500000000002
started questioning the shape of the

1255.25 --> 1257.38
earth that just there are my friends

1257.05 --> 1258.97
anymore

1257.38 --> 1261.64
yeah I mean my uncle like to leave me

1258.97 --> 1263.98
for my life when I cuz I I suggested it

1261.64 --> 1266.8000000000002
might be flat but uh most people are

1263.98 --> 1270.19
like oh yeah man you might be right it

1266.8 --> 1273.19
takes like like an inch for the distance

1270.19 --> 1275.19
from your mic you're kind of loud I'm

1273.19 --> 1280.45
sorry I know that's perfect

1275.19 --> 1282.0700000000002
so the again and some of my friends I've

1280.45 --> 1283.75
got friends that are officers in the

1282.07 --> 1285.1899999999998
military that are flat-earthers but they

1283.75 --> 1286.51
won't tell anybody that I'm like the

1285.19 --> 1291.5800000000002
only one that knows and their wife knows

1286.51 --> 1294.1299999999999
you know Wow yeah my friend is a captain

1291.58 --> 1296.6789999999999
and uh in a National Guard an infantry

1294.13 --> 1299.3090000000002
like he can he can't come out with a

1296.679 --> 1302.71
door he'll never get promoted right

1299.309 --> 1304.54
cause they're the generals and

1302.71 --> 1307.69
everything they do pay attention to that

1304.54 --> 1311.8899999999999
is their kind of glow programming in the

1307.69 --> 1314.049
military itself at all or well I mean

1311.89 --> 1316.0
well here on the marine corps he was but

1314.049 --> 1319.48
I mean the symbol of the Marine Corps is

1316.0 --> 1320.91
the Eagle Globe and Anchor you know and

1319.48 --> 1323.5
it's kind of interesting I've been

1320.91 --> 1325.0900000000001
researching the symbol you know this

1323.5 --> 1327.73
symbolism of the Eagle Globe and Anchor

1325.09 --> 1329.02
and they say I forget what they say it

1327.73 --> 1334.27
stands for now but nobody really knows

1329.02 --> 1336.85
and I think it goes back to to like the

1334.27 --> 1338.86
Roman times and because the the Marine

1336.85 --> 1340.6299999999999
Corps is the only military service in

1338.86 --> 1343.1789999999999
the world that doesn't wear a flag on

1340.63 --> 1345.0400000000002
their uniform and that's like kind of

1343.179 --> 1346.69
breaking rules in like the Geneva

1345.04 --> 1350.35
Convention and The Hague Convention and

1346.69 --> 1351.79
stuff so it's almost like we're pirates

1350.35 --> 1353.59
and when I was in the Marine Corps I

1351.79 --> 1356.71
remember you know we're not allowed to

1353.59 --> 1359.98
wear our our camouflage uniform outside

1356.71 --> 1361.96
of the base in America and I remember a

1359.98 --> 1363.22
staff and CEO telling me oh that's

1361.96 --> 1364.99
because it's an act of war and then

1363.22 --> 1368.44
because you think about it fundamentally

1364.99 --> 1370.66
we're not actually like you're not

1368.44 --> 1373.75
allowed to be minors you're not not

1370.66 --> 1376.5400000000002
allowed to be deployed on mainland right

1373.75 --> 1378.58
well yeah and if we leave if we leave

1376.54 --> 1380.1689999999999
the base of the army can they've got an

1378.58 --> 1382.27
American flag we can't because we're an

1380.169 --> 1385.5400000000002
unidentified military it's almost like

1382.27 --> 1387.91
we're pirates I'm not identified

1385.54 --> 1391.12
military yeah because we're not wearing

1387.91 --> 1392.5900000000001
any insignia and flags is that goes back

1391.12 --> 1394.8999999999999
in hundreds of years just always like

1392.59 --> 1398.1399999999999
you got a foot symbols are like

1394.9 --> 1399.8200000000002
universal language and sort of Flags

1398.14 --> 1403.75
like every us to know that that's part

1399.82 --> 1404.83
of the what war crimes are is if you you

1403.75 --> 1406.66
have to shoot somebody if you're

1404.83 --> 1408.6689999999999
shooting somebody in a war they have to

1406.66 --> 1411.009
be in uniform right and like ident

1408.669 --> 1412.8090000000002
find themselves or they have to be

1411.009 --> 1414.7
carrying a weapon well the problem was

1412.809 --> 1416.1589999999999
in Iraq they weren't that everybody

1414.7 --> 1421.239
carries a weapon because it's an open

1416.159 --> 1423.3300000000002
carry country right and so it's like it

1421.239 --> 1426.429
you know how do you distinguish between

1423.33 --> 1428.259
combatants and civilians so I think

1426.429 --> 1430.269
that's almost why they called the Marine

1428.259 --> 1431.379
Corps and to do the Iraq war and replace

1430.269 --> 1433.749
the army because that's not normally

1431.379 --> 1435.279
what we do it was like possibly to avoid

1433.749 --> 1437.47
some more crimes but who knows you know

1435.279 --> 1441.749
the u.s. whatever we say right I get it

1437.47 --> 1444.999
so it's it's not really the official

1441.749 --> 1447.159
warfare here's another I can't hold the

1444.999 --> 1449.3500000000001
thing in the United States code hold on

1447.159 --> 1451.659
I have a question about that so if the

1449.35 --> 1455.019
Marines are not designated for official

1451.659 --> 1458.529
warfare scenario what are they even

1455.019 --> 1459.909
meant for it we are here's an

1458.529 --> 1461.889
interesting thing you can look up in US

1459.909 --> 1463.509
code and it will tell you the mission of

1461.889 --> 1465.9989999999998
all the different militaries in like in

1463.509 --> 1467.529
law in u.s. code and it says it like the

1465.999 --> 1470.019
one the last sentences I can I can send

1467.529 --> 1471.73
it to you in a little bit but uh I can't

1470.019 --> 1473.529
find it right now but uh it says you

1471.73 --> 1476.8890000000001
know the Marines do this this and this

1473.529 --> 1478.749
and whatever the president needs so

1476.889 --> 1479.9189999999999
that's literally like up to what you

1478.749 --> 1483.34
know the president could just send us

1479.919 --> 1484.6000000000001
for we don't need a Congress to you know

1483.34 --> 1492.9889999999998
declare war or anything like that they

1484.6 --> 1497.649
can just send them range all right but I

1492.989 --> 1501.6290000000001
still don't get how that that does kind

1497.649 --> 1504.2199999999998
of bypass normal international law then

1501.629 --> 1505.9289999999999
well yeah I mean you know we all the

1504.22 --> 1507.97
other thing is is the United States

1505.929 --> 1510.489
isn't even like ratified to the all the

1507.97 --> 1512.799
Hague Convention and all of the Geneva

1510.489 --> 1514.0900000000001
Convention right they get away with it

1512.799 --> 1515.4089999999999
too i managers heard there's there's

1514.09 --> 1518.139
some other international court that was

1515.409 --> 1519.6090000000002
trying to come to the US and say we

1518.139 --> 1521.4989999999998
wanted to press charges on some guys and

1519.609 --> 1522.97
then like Donald Trump's guy said do you

1521.499 --> 1523.929
look this up in the news in the last few

1522.97 --> 1525.489
months it's like yeah if you do that

1523.929 --> 1533.289
we'll put you on all the judges in jail

1525.489 --> 1534.7
so it's like yeah fundamentally

1533.289 --> 1535.749
understand you know just it's

1534.7 --> 1539.23
interesting that we're the only ones

1535.749 --> 1540.159
that don't wear a flag okay yeah I

1539.23 --> 1541.049
didn't know that

1540.159 --> 1546.88
Thanks

1541.049 --> 1548.62
not a detail so yeah if you don't see

1546.88 --> 1550.5390000000002
flags but you do see people with

1548.62 --> 1553.6589999999999
uniforms you got to be really careful

1550.539 --> 1556.6
cause every everything could happen

1553.659 --> 1558.0100000000002
basically it's not this issue people

1556.6 --> 1559.6589999999999
that are that are surrendered like if

1558.01 --> 1560.74
people surrender you know you have to

1559.659 --> 1565.929
take them in you can't kill them it's

1560.74 --> 1568.809
part of this car the rules right I was

1565.929 --> 1570.669
the Marine still have those rules yeah

1568.809 --> 1572.11
we try to follow them like here's what

1570.669 --> 1573.97
an interesting thing is this is kind of

1572.11 --> 1576.1899999999998
silly because the United States with my

1573.97 --> 1577.96
dad my father is actually a Los Angeles

1576.19 --> 1580.3300000000002
County Sheriff Department for twenty and

1577.96 --> 1581.74
a half years and the gun he carried but

1580.33 --> 1583.3899999999999
the ammunition he carried were hollow

1581.74 --> 1585.01
points which are like the worst I mean

1583.39 --> 1587.44
it they're pretty much guaranteed to

1585.01 --> 1588.9089999999999
kill you in war it's still part of the

1587.44 --> 1591.5800000000002
Hague Convention you're not allowed to

1588.909 --> 1593.8600000000001
use hollow points or projectiles because

1591.58 --> 1596.559
it causes too much like too many

1593.86 --> 1598.8999999999999
problems for both sides with the yeah

1596.559 --> 1603.85
it's like maiming and overcoming

1598.9 --> 1605.169
injuries yes damage yeah well we didn't

1603.85 --> 1608.4399999999998
actually sign that we still we still

1605.169 --> 1611.6100000000001
abide by it but like I'll tell you what

1608.44 --> 1611.6100000000001
when I was in Fallujah

1611.64 --> 1616.8400000000001
gunnery sergeant actually handed us out

1613.63 --> 1618.1000000000001
a hollow point five five six rounds

1616.84 --> 1620.02
because they weren't they weren't

1618.1 --> 1622.33
falling down they were all like injected

1620.02 --> 1625.45
with the meth or adrenaline or something

1622.33 --> 1627.61
mm-hmm but but I mean we still try to

1625.45 --> 1629.65
abide by and so our rules of engagement

1627.61 --> 1632.2299999999998
were always you know you got to get shot

1629.65 --> 1638.5590000000002
at first then you can shoot back right

1632.23 --> 1643.0
okay sounds sensible so yeah let's let's

1638.559 --> 1646.299
get back to Flat Earth it wasn't right

1643.0 --> 1650.32
so yeah how long have you been into Flat

1646.299 --> 1653.8899999999999
Earth right away oh I think just over

1650.32 --> 1655.72
two years and all kind of once I heard

1653.89 --> 1658.69
about it I and I and I think I just

1655.72 --> 1660.52
watched the clues I'm more sergeant I

1658.69 --> 1662.14
was just like oh yeah I'm convinced I

1660.52 --> 1667.15
mean I'm well-traveled I've been to over

1662.14 --> 1668.5900000000001
25 countries and it's I never really

1667.15 --> 1670.1200000000001
believed the moon landing and just all

1668.59 --> 1673.03
made sense immediately like oh that's

1670.12 --> 1675.34
why they faked it you know

1673.03 --> 1676.48
I don't know my personality type I can

1675.34 --> 1677.7099999999998
see the big picture right away but of

1676.48 --> 1682.059
course I've looked into it every day

1677.71 --> 1684.3400000000001
objectively you know sense right but how

1682.059 --> 1686.47
about what was your response to the

1684.34 --> 1689.559
whole concept of the outer space

1686.47 --> 1692.47
and everything that's supposedly done

1689.559 --> 1697.4189999999999
there that that's all fake how did you

1692.47 --> 1699.34
how did that hit you yeah no okay here's

1697.419 --> 1702.46
actually here's the thing when I first

1699.34 --> 1704.23
realized it it scared the crap out of me

1702.46 --> 1706.51
I think it's because it was the first

1704.23 --> 1709.8700000000001
time my life I knew there was a creator

1706.51 --> 1712.03
and I felt like an ant you know like I

1709.87 --> 1715.78
felt like I could tell his you know I

1712.03 --> 1717.19
like I you know I could see how powerful

1715.78 --> 1719.26
he was and how you know much more

1717.19 --> 1720.8200000000002
powerful than I was and it scared the

1719.26 --> 1722.89
crap out of me the first day I was like

1720.82 --> 1724.87
it's better than nobody knows this you

1722.89 --> 1727.21
know just because of that emotion I was

1724.87 --> 1728.4089999999999
feeling but afterwards I felt like oh no

1727.21 --> 1733.78
I think a lot of people we all need to

1728.409 --> 1738.5490000000002
know right right yeah I don't feel like

1733.78 --> 1740.289
that by the way with God it's I just did

1738.549 --> 1741.76
that moment you know it was just that it

1740.289 --> 1743.14
was that it was like I realized he was

1741.76 --> 1745.36
real for the first time in my life I

1743.14 --> 1749.95
like knew he was real your Creator

1745.36 --> 1752.32
Kriegers right well what I for me it's

1749.95 --> 1754.03
always been very complicated my relation

1752.32 --> 1756.3999999999999
with God because I've always kind of

1754.03 --> 1758.77
felt he was there I just rejected the

1756.4 --> 1762.46
Bible because I thought it was corrupted

1758.77 --> 1764.679
but I didn't know it yeah see that and

1762.46 --> 1766.179
then things get really weird because I'm

1764.679 --> 1774.49
basically writing on my intuition

1766.179 --> 1778.539
without the wisdom and I had just I was

1774.49 --> 1781.24
at a point even like testing like is

1778.539 --> 1785.14
this real is this really a sin if you do

1781.24 --> 1788.26
this how do you know it do you have to

1785.14 --> 1791.169
ignore something or is it really

1788.26 --> 1794.44
something you're you're basically

1791.169 --> 1797.169
putting on yourself mentally because I

1794.44 --> 1799.39
just I couldn't take all those things

1797.169 --> 1801.8200000000002
just for granted like yeah that is a sin

1799.39 --> 1805.98
and that is a sin it I didn't get it so

1801.82 --> 1809.7
I very carefully

1805.98 --> 1815.76
as kind of an atheist rebellious figure

1809.7 --> 1818.25
tried to try to move there but I like

1815.76 --> 1822.08
every step of the way it's just my inner

1818.25 --> 1825.0
my subconscious would just immediately

1822.08 --> 1835.6789999999999
respond allergic ly like don't do this

1825.0 --> 1837.21
is bad and so you know it's someone's

1835.679 --> 1841.169
you know sometimes I think I don't see

1837.21 --> 1843.15
you like God is an individual I think

1841.169 --> 1846.0
all of that is our personified

1843.15 --> 1850.77
relationship with it but I just think

1846.0 --> 1853.86
that we are like in his mind we are a

1850.77 --> 1856.35
part of God we are in the Alpha and the

1853.86 --> 1860.54
Omega that that's just how it's always

1856.35 --> 1863.73
felt we are them he we are his

1860.54 --> 1866.0
magnificent imagination manifestation

1863.73 --> 1870.33
that's how it kind of feels like we are

1866.0 --> 1876.72
we are logos we are the result of his

1870.33 --> 1878.28
design yeah right no that's all that's

1876.72 --> 1880.77
really fascinating I'm open mind at all

1878.28 --> 1882.09
but I mean I'm still I'm super up

1880.77 --> 1885.12
reminders for the Bible I wouldn't say

1882.09 --> 1888.09
I'm I'm uh you know I'm hard percent a

1885.12 --> 1890.07
Christian but you know I sure you know I

1888.09 --> 1892.32
believe in Jesus Christ and do that

1890.07 --> 1894.33
that's all it takes you know no big deal

1892.32 --> 1897.33
but I'm still kind of searching you know

1894.33 --> 1901.52
fine well I don't think it that is

1897.33 --> 1906.12
really all that it takes although it is

1901.52 --> 1909.45
important place to start right I studied

1906.12 --> 1911.3999999999999
in I studied its energy its it's all

1909.45 --> 1914.309
about the frequency it's all about the

1911.4 --> 1918.8090000000002
energy and upholding it walking that

1914.309 --> 1921.87
path through time and there you can't

1918.809 --> 1923.8799999999999
just say oh I believe this now from now

1921.87 --> 1929.549
on it's alright no that's just the

1923.88 --> 1931.14
beginning of the test yeah after I was

1929.549 --> 1932.37
in the Marine Corps I used my thing

1931.14 --> 1933.9
called the GI Bill where they pay for

1932.37 --> 1936.0
your school and I went to school in

1933.9 --> 1938.01
Thailand I lived there for like four and

1936.0 --> 1939.57
a half years and so I'm real familiar

1938.01 --> 1940.89
with the Buddhist religion if

1939.57 --> 1943.59
I was always before I even came a

1940.89 --> 1945.8100000000002
flutter core but uh of course this was

1943.59 --> 1947.55
like 10 years ago I was always more

1945.81 --> 1949.95
open-minded to to their that religion

1947.55 --> 1951.57
because it was more attractive

1949.95 --> 1952.8
there's nobody knocking on your door you

1951.57 --> 1954.45
know trying to trying to sign you up

1952.8 --> 1956.43
they all just believed it you know

1954.45 --> 1960.14
all right and and I've definitely

1956.43 --> 1963.6000000000001
experienced karma an observe Karma sure

1960.14 --> 1966.1200000000001
yep yeah I totally agree it but it's

1963.6 --> 1968.79
just more a a way to conduct your life

1966.12 --> 1971.6699999999998
and that is kind of my angle to

1968.79 --> 1974.3999999999999
Christianity that's why I don't really

1971.67 --> 1976.77
say go to churches because that's all

1974.4 --> 1979.98
that structure of the church and oh my

1976.77 --> 1981.81
it is kind of contradictory to even what

1979.98 --> 1984.81
the Bible says is supposed to be go

1981.81 --> 1987.99
alone with Christianity so I just say no

1984.81 --> 1990.3
I'm an eclectic Christian I say the the

1987.99 --> 1995.61
body of Christianity is over all

1990.3 --> 1999.6299999999999
reprogrammed and polluted and like maybe

1995.61 --> 2002.7199999999998
or unclear and there's just individuals

1999.63 --> 2005.0600000000002
and they're supposed to be getting it

2002.72 --> 2008.54
totally by themselves and figuring out

2005.06 --> 2011.86
yes you are the church and you need to

2008.54 --> 2014.3
keep and approach it all like that and

2011.86 --> 2017.99
then walk the path and that's what I'm

2014.3 --> 2019.84
trying to do sure you know I agree what

2017.99 --> 2023.93
word was that you just used was eclectic

2019.84 --> 2026.99
eclectic is just eclectic basically

2023.93 --> 2029.78
means figuring it out yourself without

2026.99 --> 2032.1200000000001
following and I wrote some things down

2029.78 --> 2034.61
to how to say when I called it but I've

2032.12 --> 2036.1699999999998
heard a compliment self-talk its itself

2034.61 --> 2038.4799999999998
I thought that's what it technically

2036.17 --> 2040.43
right no I wanted to compliment you on

2038.48 --> 2042.14
your on your vocabulary I'm like a big

2040.43 --> 2043.46
fan of yours I mean you're from a

2042.14 --> 2046.19
different country I think your native

2043.46 --> 2048.56
language would be Dutch right yes yeah

2046.19 --> 2052.58
this guy's got better vocabulary than I

2048.56 --> 2054.83
do but uh I pay attention I respect that

2052.58 --> 2058.0
man it's good on you for that well I I

2054.83 --> 2062.0
learned that about the different forms

2058.0 --> 2064.07
before I even was a conscious Christian

2062.0 --> 2066.44
as it were when I was still in Wicca

2064.07 --> 2069.29
because there is the issue issues as

2066.44 --> 2071.6
well there's like entire groups you're

2069.29 --> 2072.74
gonna have to basically take a part off

2071.6 --> 2075.44
to become

2072.74 --> 2080.27
a Wicca in that sector and or you could

2075.44 --> 2082.57
go eclectic and become a solo tradition

2080.27 --> 2089.27
as it were that's all so I learned about

2082.57 --> 2090.619
these terminologies back then no yeah no

2089.27 --> 2092.69
no I mean I was trying to compliment

2090.619 --> 2094.909
your your in your vocabulary in general

2092.69 --> 2096.98
but I was just learning another word

2094.909 --> 2099.98
that's why I asked you that it looks a

2096.98 --> 2101.54
lot of words from you the other one the

2099.98 --> 2102.05
other day it was like machination or

2101.54 --> 2105.92
something

2102.05 --> 2108.7000000000003
imagination machination it's a tricky

2105.92 --> 2111.08
word I really had to look it up I

2108.7 --> 2114.9199999999996
spilled it I spelled it correctly on my

2111.08 --> 2117.35
first try mm-hmm

2114.92 --> 2121.52
I don't know what is up with Randy he

2117.35 --> 2122.8689999999997
seems to be acting like a total [ __ ] in

2121.52 --> 2128.18
my chat I don't get it

2122.869 --> 2131.36
well Randy was please Randy stop making

2128.18 --> 2132.47
like I swear you you talk to him and he

2131.36 --> 2139.9100000000003
maybe must forgive you I know what's

2132.47 --> 2141.7099999999996
going on why he's doing that he's doing

2139.91 --> 2145.73
the same thing what's worse chemo does

2141.71 --> 2148.369
it's just smearing yeah and I don't get

2145.73 --> 2151.82
it colleagues we've been talking on a

2148.369 --> 2158.119
daily basis for years what are you doing

2151.82 --> 2160.1000000000004
Randy yeah the other thing what he was

2158.119 --> 2162.98
the whole presentation he had it didn't

2160.1 --> 2165.89
even it was just a waste of time I

2162.98 --> 2167.72
didn't watch it I was initial

2165.89 --> 2168.859
presentation yesterday when you were on

2167.72 --> 2170.45
the show and you got into with them and

2168.859 --> 2172.52
we were asking for data or two days ago

2170.45 --> 2177.1699999999996
maybe when you were asking for data you

2172.52 --> 2178.16
know right he was presenting was a waste

2177.17 --> 2180.6800000000003
of time it wasn't were warned

2178.16 --> 2183.92
establishing causation or anything right

2180.68 --> 2186.44
so in the meantime I think Paul and

2183.92 --> 2188.84
others have presented other data of

2186.44 --> 2195.08
other balloon launches that actually

2188.84 --> 2197.06
matched so that's what I've seen so

2195.08 --> 2199.34
let's really wasn't my fluids what's the

2197.06 --> 2201.02
big deal compared to the data I don't

2199.34 --> 2203.27
compare data to Google Google is not the

2201.02 --> 2206.33
arbiter of truth right well you could

2203.27 --> 2206.599
but if it had a source you got to get to

2206.33 --> 2208.5789999999997
this

2206.599 --> 2211.69
and then you know if it's real or if

2208.579 --> 2213.71
it's just some wiki blah blah blah

2211.69 --> 2214.7000000000003
yeah because well the other thing is

2213.71 --> 2216.049
what they're confusing me with this

2214.7 --> 2218.359
whole I think they're trying to claim

2216.049 --> 2220.91
that there's like a temperature barrier

2218.359 --> 2224.359
or something but isn't the UH at the top

2220.91 --> 2225.47
of the e the ionosphere below maybe the

2224.359 --> 2227.45
top of stress or isn't it like really

2225.47 --> 2229.97
hot isn't the temperature really now or

2227.45 --> 2233.3289999999997
electrically now it's not really hot a

2229.97 --> 2238.729
way to you mean the suppose it entry

2233.329 --> 2243.38
layer where everything burns that that

2238.729 --> 2246.3799999999997
doesn't exist okay that that's not part

2243.38 --> 2250.759
of the V not yeah we can't verify that

2246.38 --> 2255.2000000000003
anyways can't go out there sure well not

2250.759 --> 2258.229
that we know of yet who knows you might

2255.2 --> 2261.759
bump into it a a dome or something first

2258.229 --> 2261.759
before you even get there

2263.559 --> 2270.7690000000002
as soon as we figure out how to escape

2266.359 --> 2272.5389999999998
the the thinnest of our layers because

2270.769 --> 2274.43
that's all that is required in order to

2272.539 --> 2277.2490000000003
actually bump into the barrier of the

2274.43 --> 2277.8999999999996
container which must be there at some

2277.249 --> 2281.8289999999997
point

2277.9 --> 2281.829
mm-hmm somehow

2292.66 --> 2297.94
well Manuel yeah I just want to call in

2295.42 --> 2299.6800000000003

2427.089 --> 2436.359
is wrong with you but I'm done with you

2429.519 --> 2439.39
forever I can't believe you're allowing

2436.359 --> 2440.14
yourself to act like an old woman like

2439.39 --> 2450.43
this

2440.14 --> 2453.8689999999997
it's disgusting it does not weigh up to

2450.43 --> 2459.459
the positives that you have for me sorry

2453.869 --> 2463.539
just piss off dude don't think there's

2459.459 --> 2467.16
enough room for your ego here you're

2463.539 --> 2467.1600000000003
gonna have to use your own show for that

2473.43 --> 2481.749
yeah yeah no no don't look at some point

2478.079 --> 2484.38
you go so far that there is no way you

2481.749 --> 2488.3489999999997
can make an excuse for that

2484.38 --> 2492.969
after there's no making up for that some

2488.349 --> 2498.69
things cannot be unsaid and he's acting

2492.969 --> 2501.369
really disgusting really disgusting

2498.69 --> 2503.579
thank you ego playing an anchor for the

2501.369 --> 2506.65
$10 ship but she had the nation my man

2503.579 --> 2511.3590000000004
support what you like or it goes away

2506.65 --> 2513.19
Owen Benjamin indeed i i definitely join

2511.359 --> 2516.64
him with my or winnie and bear account

2513.19 --> 2518.709
and then at you is common I think he

2516.64 --> 2520.299
actually catches my comments and reasons

2518.709 --> 2522.519
sometimes but it's hard to tell because

2520.299 --> 2525.729
I tend to say things that other people

2522.519 --> 2528.729
are also saying but yeah I'm enjoying a

2525.729 --> 2533.499
lot his recent few shows have been just

2528.729 --> 2537.7889999999998
fantastic it's cool right now come on

2533.499 --> 2539.769
guys don't start calling Randy a closet

2537.789 --> 2543.039
globe head I'm pretty sure he's not that

2539.769 --> 2545.729
would be absolutely [ __ ] there is no

2543.039 --> 2547.3300000000004
way he could technically be that stupid

2545.729 --> 2552.49
however

2547.33 --> 2556.45
he's turned into a savant a a whiny

2552.49 --> 2562.8399999999997
[ __ ] that manipulates and attacks other

2556.45 --> 2568.45
people to try to gather more for them so

2562.84 --> 2569.8500000000004
yeah latest victim to Savannah syndrome

2568.45 --> 2574.0899999999997
[Music]

2569.85 --> 2579.39
correlating old [ __ ] behavior in other

2574.09 --> 2582.78
words FAC behavior yeah serve on yay

2579.39 --> 2582.7799999999997
that's what they do

2583.59 --> 2595.3900000000003
yeah yeah what was Owen Benjamin about

2591.16 --> 2603.93
yesterday somewhere the the Boomer thing

2595.39 --> 2603.93
I think see I know I laughed a lot

2605.549 --> 2614.069
oh yeah the that was awesome the

2611.579 --> 2618.529
presenting evidence to boomer that JFK

2614.069 --> 2623.819
was a homosexual that was just so funny

2618.529 --> 2628.529
love that clip that's excellent

2623.819 --> 2631.859
it is almost the same comedy style as

2628.529 --> 2633.989
Paul Joseph Watson uses a lot in his

2631.859 --> 2636.179
videos it's kind of the same setup but

2633.989 --> 2642.599
with the South Park thing it's I loved

2636.179 --> 2645.659
it it was so good thank you over mukou

2642.599 --> 2648.3900000000003
and thank you Amanda young for $6 super

2645.659 --> 2654.739
chat donation randy is having a temper

2648.39 --> 2654.739
tantrum yep that seems to be the case

2662.65 --> 2668.71
yeah you know what really cost me to

2665.319 --> 2671.339
kick him for real and it was it was not

2668.71 --> 2674.65
a hundred percent straight for it was a

2671.339 --> 2678.069
aspect of misunderstanding there but

2674.65 --> 2680.4990000000003
that I'll have to just now that I banned

2678.069 --> 2682.18
him I can actually find the calm to

2680.499 --> 2685.269
calmly explain it without getting

2682.18 --> 2689.2
agitated and getting it wrong because

2685.269 --> 2692.6189999999997
what happened is worse chemo was trying

2689.2 --> 2695.049
to explain something and people were

2692.619 --> 2697.869
talking over it and at first I did that

2695.049 --> 2700.569
too so what I did is just say look guys

2697.869 --> 2702.849
shut up and let's pursue chemo finish

2700.569 --> 2704.619
that's what I said pretty loud I don't

2702.849 --> 2708.19
know if that came across but Sporus

2704.619 --> 2710.8900000000003
chemo then took the silence after that

2708.19 --> 2715.39
to start whining and complaining about

2710.89 --> 2718.569
how I was over talking him like what the

2715.39 --> 2722.5589999999997
[ __ ] dude I just silenced everyone for

2718.569 --> 2725.349
you and then Rizzo is irritated like

2722.559 --> 2728.739
what the [ __ ] dude this is insane

2725.349 --> 2731.1400000000003
so I was just really pissed off at him

2728.739 --> 2735.5190000000002
and just said shut the [ __ ] up Smurfs

2731.14 --> 2738.3089999999997
chemo you freakin idiots and then ranty

2735.519 --> 2741.7299999999996
got all triggered because he took what

2738.309 --> 2745.17
Spurs chemo said ass like that what was

2741.73 --> 2748.9
happening and I was like now Randy just

2745.17 --> 2751.029
like that is just the wrong moment to do

2748.9 --> 2755.7000000000003
that it's just horrifying he's oh I just

2751.029 --> 2759.249
kicked him it's cuz like no not gonna

2755.7 --> 2761.499
not gonna allow that [ __ ] and I wasn't

2759.249 --> 2764.3489999999997
gonna kick spurs chemo necessarily

2761.499 --> 2769.4199999999996
because I did feel that it was going

2764.349 --> 2771.989
somewhere more than before but Randy was

2769.42 --> 2771.989
just

2775.67 --> 2786.3
it was trying to be sparse chemos

2778.89 --> 2790.23
wingmen in an in his crazy ship and his

2786.3 --> 2801.0890000000004
manipulation is just yeah enough talk

2790.23 --> 2804.15
about this it just anyway it was a huge

2801.089 --> 2804.69
misunderstanding I just wanted to help

2804.15 --> 2806.79
out

2804.69 --> 2811.38
then God blamed for the thing that I was

2806.79 --> 2813.18
trying to help out with and then I got

2811.38 --> 2815.25
really pissed off and kicked Randy

2813.18 --> 2817.0499999999997
because they were attacking me when I

2815.25 --> 2819.24
was trying to help out that's basically

2817.05 --> 2822.02
it that's why I kicked him so now you

2819.24 --> 2822.02
got the full story

2828.51 --> 2837.1600000000003
let's talk about D&D and for real yeah

2834.16 --> 2842.56
yeah and the f-bomb it was it was too

2837.16 --> 2845.74
much but look I can get pretty energetic

2842.56 --> 2847.869
you know but what I'm really genuinely

2845.74 --> 2851.589
trying to help out somebody that I don't

2847.869 --> 2854.26
even like that much just the arbiter

2851.589 --> 2858.45
just to get the piece back get things

2854.26 --> 2858.4500000000003
back on track and I didn't get attacked

2858.48 --> 2865.089
and blamed for the thing that I'm trying

2862.24 --> 2867.45
to prevent that's just too much you know

2865.089 --> 2871.38
that that makes me really explode

2867.45 --> 2873.21
because it's just ultimate injustice so

2871.38 --> 2876.389
that's what happens

2873.21 --> 2876.389
[Music]

2880.53 --> 2891.8300000000004
right ah yeah that's try this thing

2901.07 --> 2907.7000000000003
Nathan is premiering again

2904.25 --> 2912.15
when is he gonna do a live show again

2907.7 --> 2916.64
huh oh this seems more like pure

2912.15 --> 2916.64
chocolate but interesting

2924.61 --> 2928.21
and that's heavy stuff

2932.75 --> 2935.86
[Music]

2945.34 --> 2954.34
right dank that's what I think too and

2951.34 --> 2960.3900000000003
my main issue is is that he's dragging

2954.34 --> 2967.6000000000004
everyone with him or a lot of people and

2960.39 --> 2974.74
those people are basically stepping over

2967.6 --> 2978.97
lines in the process like ranty like

2974.74 --> 2982.4799999999996
others and yeah after it turns out that

2978.97 --> 2986.2599999999998
was all complete waste of time everybody

2982.48 --> 2990.79
still did all that [ __ ] live it's really

2986.26 --> 2993.34
ending up with no result whatsoever it's

2990.79 --> 2996.46
not helping it's not helping anyone and

2993.34 --> 2999.31
that is my biggest problem with it look

2996.46 --> 3002.87
I have no problem with just thought

2999.31 --> 3007.5
experiments but if you're actually gonna

3002.87 --> 3011.18
wager on it and manipulate for it that's

3007.5 --> 3011.18
where things go really bad

3016.63 --> 3025.2200000000003
ya know I'm not gonna Skype Randy I'm

3021.77 --> 3027.38
never gonna talk to him again if

3025.22 --> 3029.4199999999996
somebody can get him to give an

3027.38 --> 3032.51
elaborate apology that's actually

3029.42 --> 3037.73
fitting and proper to what he's been

3032.51 --> 3038.2400000000002
doing that I might just unblock him

3037.73 --> 3040.82
again

3038.24 --> 3042.7099999999996
or something but until that time I I

3040.82 --> 3045.44
don't want to have anything to do with

3042.71 --> 3047.02
this guy I'm pretty disgusted with him

3045.44 --> 3051.609
right now

3047.02 --> 3051.609
and that's not gonna go away so easily

3063.87 --> 3067.5699999999997
[Music]

3069.72 --> 3073.1499999999996
[Music]

3074.15 --> 3082.88
yeah mmm Oh what did you miss chocolate

3080.9 --> 3084.71
oh I had a good talk with the Eagle

3082.88 --> 3086.9
plane an anchor about a lot of things

3084.71 --> 3089.9900000000002
also about the issues with press chemo

3086.9 --> 3093.4100000000003
and ranty and run-ins in the debates and

3089.99 --> 3096.68
what he's doing and then Randy thought

3093.41 --> 3105.859
it was a really good idea to be a total

3096.68 --> 3108.259
Savannah [ __ ] in my chat and that is

3105.859 --> 3114.7
so in that is just so out of place so

3108.259 --> 3114.7
bad that I just decided to ban him and

3116.769 --> 3124.1299999999997
yeah I don't feel like associating with

3122.119 --> 3132.4100000000003
him in the slightest

3124.13 --> 3135.8900000000003
from this point on because he's been

3132.41 --> 3138.5589999999997
acting like a [ __ ] but I do not accept

3135.89 --> 3141.91
that that kind of behavior from somebody

3138.559 --> 3141.9100000000003
that I thought was my friend

3144.57 --> 3147.7690000000002
[Music]

3150.21 --> 3159.2400000000002
yeah chocolate really if you scroll up

3155.29 --> 3159.24
you can see the messages

3165.81 --> 3177.15
let's see where is it wait did it I'll

3171.0 --> 3179.43
get okay well anyway in everything he

3177.15 --> 3183.77
pretty much said was all in the chat

3179.43 --> 3189.77
recorded it seems to be all gone now but

3183.77 --> 3189.77
yeah over muku alright yeah to chocolate

3195.76 --> 3208.96
what what are you talking about Ragnar

3198.64 --> 3212.02
Stefan he'll listen I do what I tell me

3208.96 --> 3214.869
to do nobody tells me what to do I may

3212.02 --> 3216.88
agree with somebody or not nobody's

3214.869 --> 3221.53
gonna tell me what to do I make my own

3216.88 --> 3224.38
choices thank you very much yeah it

3221.53 --> 3227.4700000000003
seems so Brandon sorry about that but

3224.38 --> 3229.81
it'll it's still visible in the chat if

3227.47 --> 3233.609
you watch the video back and he was just

3229.81 --> 3236.2
being really disgusting and saying Oh

3233.609 --> 3240.0699999999997
Darwin is not getting a job and he's

3236.2 --> 3242.89
being lazy and just smearing me being

3240.07 --> 3247.0
really disgusting and personally

3242.89 --> 3250.21
attacking me in ways you should never do

3247.0 --> 3253.14
ever to somebody that you've gotten to

3250.21 --> 3257.02
know personally because that is

3253.14 --> 3259.96
disgusting if he did that in front of my

3257.02 --> 3262.95
face I hit him so hard he probably break

3259.96 --> 3268.29
his jaw maybe get a serious concussion

3262.95 --> 3273.66
because that is so disgusting to do that

3268.29 --> 3273.66
it's a blatant violation of friendship

3296.04 --> 3300.39
yeah chocolate actually posted that

3298.26 --> 3308.13
article two days ago in the master beat

3300.39 --> 3309.18
yet I read it through him that's

3308.13 --> 3313.65
[ __ ]

3309.18 --> 3318.8999999999996
Ragnar Stefan hell listen Nathan just

3313.65 --> 3320.85
has a good show that is kind of grounded

3318.9 --> 3323.52
up to a certain level it's even

3320.85 --> 3327.48
improving even the original John

3323.52 --> 3331.74
conceptualisation is improving it's not

3327.48 --> 3336.51
as rigid as it was and they've stepped

3331.74 --> 3339.0299999999997
away from using certain misapplications

3336.51 --> 3341.5800000000004
of good arguments so there is

3339.03 --> 3344.1600000000003
improvement and even John's behavior

3341.58 --> 3348.0299999999997
overall is on average improving and yeah

3344.16 --> 3352.71
I can't just say what they once did it

3348.03 --> 3356.9700000000003
very bad now they have to go no I'm not

3352.71 --> 3362.91
[ __ ] I am gonna give credit where

3356.97 --> 3366.2599999999998
credit is due and that's just it and I

3362.91 --> 3369.45
follow my own thing I am still I'm not

3366.26 --> 3372.2700000000004
I've took a long pause because of all

3369.45 --> 3375.2999999999997
the weather and [ __ ] but I will continue

3372.27 --> 3378.18
the quantum mechanics studies soon as I

3375.3 --> 3382.26
yeah I have to basically restart it or

3378.18 --> 3386.66
get back on track because I definitely

3382.26 --> 3389.6090000000004
got very distracted towards other things

3386.66 --> 3393.69
and it'll continue and I will have my

3389.609 --> 3401.359
criticism of things John says things

3393.69 --> 3403.58
Nathan Nathan says as I always do so

3401.359 --> 3406.8199999999997
let's see

3403.58 --> 3411.0099999999998
I don't see why you'd have to say like

3406.82 --> 3411.01
I'm is freakin slave or something

3418.94 --> 3425.569
are you serious are you actually saying

3423.319 --> 3430.25
that in my chat recognize effing hey

3425.569 --> 3433.73
listen that's really disappointing that

3430.25 --> 3441.589
is just freakin dumb dude that's really

3433.73 --> 3446.329
dumb so that Earth is not at a historic

3441.589 --> 3447.259
low because of Nathan's show don't be a

3446.329 --> 3450.759
dumbass

3447.259 --> 3455.7690000000002
it's at an all-time low because the

3450.759 --> 3459.71
freaking algorithms are admittedly and

3455.769 --> 3461.72
contractually strangling Flat Earth okay

3459.71 --> 3475.25
that has nothing to do with Nathan's

3461.72 --> 3477.6499999999996
show don't be a dumbass just why why are

3475.25 --> 3479.839
you doing this why are you freaking

3477.65 --> 3484.039
letting yourself be polarized into a

3479.839 --> 3488.92
retardation stop allowing that to happen

3484.039 --> 3488.92
to you you can't do that it's stupid

3490.66 --> 3493.8599999999997
[Music]

3498.73 --> 3506.48
Regnier Stephon Alderson people have

3501.98 --> 3510.71
always come to Nathan's for the laws for

3506.48 --> 3513.95
the cracking and breaking down of the

3510.71 --> 3518.71
insanity of the baller fanatics that's

3513.95 --> 3521.6189999999997
the show that's pretty much half up to

3518.71 --> 3524.539
2/3 of the entire format of the show

3521.619 --> 3526.069
that's why it worked that's why he got

3524.539 --> 3528.1400000000003
so many subscribers that's why he's

3526.069 --> 3529.67
getting so many super Jets that's why he

3528.14 --> 3532.0389999999998
has so many patreon

3529.67 --> 3534.799
that's why he has a giant website now

3532.039 --> 3539.9500000000003
with a lot of you don't know what you're

3534.799 --> 3539.95
talking about it nathan is doing great

3551.01 --> 3555.15
how has Nathan's show improved the

3554.08 --> 3558.63
conversation

3555.15 --> 3562.27
well how about laying the complete

3558.63 --> 3566.37
freaking scientific groundwork for the

3562.27 --> 3581.53
entire set of arguments we have perhaps

3566.37 --> 3583.98
maybe hello remember I just can't be

3581.53 --> 3583.98
serious

3587.16 --> 3595.3199999999997
no no time for you to go Jim our troll

3604.17 --> 3615.52
where we're White Bear remember what

3611.38 --> 3621.4
people what happens when people say is a

3615.52 --> 3624.25
liar wrong without actually providing

3621.4 --> 3627.34
the the proof or a direct indication

3624.25 --> 3630.16
that actually proves it it gets me

3627.34 --> 3634.2000000000003
really ticked off and I kind of like you

3630.16 --> 3637.77
white bear but don't do that unless

3634.2 --> 3641.29
you're actually gonna provide the real

3637.77 --> 3643.99
example on which you base what you're

3641.29 --> 3645.73
saying there because it just pisses me

3643.99 --> 3649.68
off when people do that in my chat

3645.73 --> 3649.68
especially if they're not trolls

3656.96 --> 3665.45
are you god you're just trolling me now

3665.93 --> 3672.8689999999997
this this is just a lie mother

3670.64 --> 3676.29
mozzarellas mist I don't even know who

3672.869 --> 3681.57
you are seriously but Nathan's publicly

3676.29 --> 3697.35
denounced the mudflat you idiots he said

3681.57 --> 3700.88
he thought it was [ __ ] okay and in

3697.35 --> 3703.56
retrospect after everything since then I

3700.88 --> 3706.38
kind of have to agree and I've even

3703.56 --> 3710.81
spoken out about it as well

3706.38 --> 3716.4900000000002
that I have very serious flood serious

3710.81 --> 3721.41
doubts and objections to a unified mud

3716.49 --> 3723.81
flood happening very serious doubts and

3721.41 --> 3728.16
I think that it's probably a much more

3723.81 --> 3731.31
it's a set or maybe a a group of

3728.16 --> 3733.79
localized events that did not go at the

3731.31 --> 3733.79
same time

3737.19 --> 3747.71
it's still very interesting no it just

3741.21 --> 3751.369
shows that in the past a lot of worlds

3747.71 --> 3755.309
landscape changing things have happened

3751.369 --> 3757.759
even in the not-too-distant past that's

3755.309 --> 3762.049
the interesting thing about it not

3757.759 --> 3767.73
weather how no it's just look the world

3762.049 --> 3772.2
literally changes by pretty radical

3767.73 --> 3774.15
actions or by just things that seem to

3772.2 --> 3777.269
happen that really changed things around

3774.15 --> 3782.2200000000003
and that's good to keep in mind when

3777.269 --> 3786.0789999999997
trying to size up the past but also to

3782.22 --> 3786.0789999999997
be able to find inconsistencies

3799.02 --> 3804.69
what's the issue Ragnar Stefan Alderson

3801.51 --> 3807.3
are you talking about yesterday there is

3804.69 --> 3810.51
an acceleration rate it just doesn't

3807.3 --> 3814.38
prove gravity it's part of the

3810.51 --> 3818.15
aberration of gravity all the different

3814.38 --> 3820.61
things put together the loose

3818.15 --> 3824.04
observations they loose effects

3820.61 --> 3826.02
structure together within the aberration

3824.04 --> 3830.46
the proof --less aberration the

3826.02 --> 3834.48
assumption of gravity and the 9.8 meters

3830.46 --> 3839.64
per meters per second square in a vacuum

3834.48 --> 3842.4900000000002
is part of that so yeah things do indeed

3839.64 --> 3844.3799999999997
fall that speed it doesn't prove gravity

3842.49 --> 3855.4199999999996
though it only proves it

3844.38 --> 3858.77
if you presuppose it and that's not

3855.42 --> 3858.77
gonna work out scientifically

3869.99 --> 3881.93
man that bar wasn't a giant meal I'm

3877.099 --> 3886.0
full anyway I'm gonna round out to show

3881.93 --> 3886.0
it's been them quite all over the place

3889.15 --> 3900.23
no no Ragnar stop it stop it right now

3897.56 --> 3903.29
or you're gone I don't know what's wrong

3900.23 --> 3907.43
with people why are you doing this why

3903.29 --> 3909.47
do you keep doing this it's like every

3907.43 --> 3910.7599999999998
time all these people in my chats I've

3909.47 --> 3913.0099999999998
been seeing you for months and months

3910.76 --> 3914.5
and months and one by one you're all

3913.01 --> 3924.32
going nuts

3914.5 --> 3929.32
why are you doing this stop going

3924.32 --> 3934.46
freakin insane keep your wits together

3929.32 --> 3936.6090000000004
stop overgeneralizing I'm sick of this

3934.46 --> 3948.32
stop it

3936.609 --> 3951.0499999999997
you're not helping anyone it's just that

3948.32 --> 3953.9900000000002
I like talking to the guy he's been in

3951.05 --> 3958.2200000000003
my chat he's been nice I do is so it

3953.99 --> 3962.589
hurts me when people I like do this stop

3958.22 --> 3962.589
it it hurts

3966.77 --> 3986.5099999999998
ah all right so I'm gonna run out the

3980.93 --> 3992.27
show it's it's not gonna lead to any

3986.51 --> 3994.8700000000003
thing comer apparently I will not be

3992.27 --> 4000.52
joining the Bates since it's not there

3994.87 --> 4004.12
there's only premier I hope the debates

4000.52 --> 4006.88
will be back at some point I did find it

4004.12 --> 4009.04
interesting to be part of it and I do

4006.88 --> 4013.1400000000003
find it more stimulating in the recent

4009.04 --> 4013.14

4077.74 --> 4087.22
early-bird number 263 yeah indeed might

4084.7 --> 4092.08
be a long session because it's Saturday
