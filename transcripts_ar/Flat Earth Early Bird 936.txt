91.52 --> 95.28
the weather outside here is very similar

94.079 --> 101.83999999999999
looking to

95.28 --> 101.84
the background of my show

103.28 --> 118.719
sun is over there

115.6 --> 119.52
it's nice and warm i think it is very

118.719 --> 121.83999999999999
moist

119.52 --> 121.83999999999999
though

123.6 --> 127.439
and yeah there's a nice breeze

127.759 --> 130.879
not yeah no no pulling winds or anything

130.399 --> 133.92
just

130.879 --> 137.76
nice breeze with like

133.92 --> 140.83999999999997
well not really cold

137.76 --> 142.39999999999998
wind so it's yeah it's just a nice

140.84 --> 144.879
mellow

142.4 --> 144.87900000000002
breeze

146.0 --> 149.92
it's really weather for just hanging

148.8 --> 151.76000000000002
around

149.92 --> 154.07999999999998
and i've even seen the birds doing that

151.76 --> 154.07999999999998
again

155.04 --> 158.16
they were like spread like

159.12 --> 163.12
just chilling out on the roof

163.2 --> 170.879
right hello isles

166.879 --> 174.07999999999998
g nathan oakley 1980 tony whitcomb

170.879 --> 177.76
john m truth good servant

174.08 --> 177.76000000000002
wow okay piling in

177.84 --> 181.20000000000002
yeah welcome to the show

181.36 --> 187.28
it's the 26th of june 2021

189.599 --> 193.76
was just rounding out watching our own

192.48 --> 196.84
benjamin

193.76 --> 198.39999999999998
because i did get up pretty early today

196.84 --> 202.48
oh

198.4 --> 202.48000000000002
i had plenty of time to do stuff

202.72 --> 208.48
so nice and on time today as well

208.879 --> 216.879
but yeah it was really interesting

213.519 --> 216.87900000000002
especially the last part

217.12 --> 219.92000000000002
where he was

221.44 --> 226.319
laying out an idea that i've had not

224.0 --> 227.04
saying that he took it from me he might

226.319 --> 230.07999999999998
i don't think

227.04 --> 231.92
owen benjamin watches anything about me

230.08 --> 234.15900000000002
but i think that my ideas might be

231.92 --> 238.83999999999997
indirectly echoing or it's just

234.159 --> 241.2
something that happens these ideas

238.84 --> 244.56
arrive at certain

241.2 --> 248.07999999999998
intervals with different people

244.56 --> 251.84
but he basically said like yeah

248.08 --> 254.239
taking the energy out of the air

251.84 --> 255.92000000000002
if that happens everywhere and tapped

254.239 --> 259.759
into too much

255.92 --> 261.359
might it distort the heavens or the sun

259.759 --> 264.0
that's something i've said you know

261.359 --> 264.0
years ago

267.28 --> 270.88
like yeah that seems logical because

269.84 --> 274.63899999999995
yeah the

270.88 --> 278.0
holographic heavenly phenomena

274.639 --> 283.68
the lights including the sun they

278.0 --> 285.84
they must be electrical

283.68 --> 287.28000000000003
like there's no other way to have that

285.84 --> 290.08
strong light output

287.28 --> 291.03999999999996
without electricity in some form in some

290.08 --> 293.59999999999997
way

291.04 --> 294.96000000000004
so i speculated okay if there is

293.6 --> 296.0
according to some people just

294.96 --> 301.12
electricity in the

296.0 --> 306.08
air then maybe that could be

301.12 --> 308.32
the thing with lack of better options

306.08 --> 310.4
like a source of energy for the

308.32 --> 311.199
celestials and then yeah if you tap into

310.4 --> 312.56
it

311.199 --> 315.68
it's not going to be infinite that

312.56 --> 315.68
wouldn't make any sense

316.0 --> 318.96
physically it wouldn't

319.52 --> 324.479
so yeah if you take away from that

322.56 --> 326.32
energy and it happens too much then

324.479 --> 330.639
maybe the heavens will falter

326.32 --> 333.919
like locally i suggest that it might

330.639 --> 336.56
form perform a local

333.919 --> 338.0
drop of the heavenly lights and that

336.56 --> 340.639
regions that wouldn't be

338.0 --> 342.08
tapping into it that they might have

340.639 --> 344.72
less

342.08 --> 344.71999999999997
issues and

345.199 --> 350.639
and even present extra crystal clear

347.36 --> 350.639
skies because of it

351.28 --> 353.84
anyway

362.16 --> 367.44
you don't hear much of owen these days

364.0 --> 371.44
well tony whitcomb you gotta follow him

367.44 --> 372.639
on bitchute uploads his videos there

371.44 --> 377.36
there's other ways

372.639 --> 377.36
he has a website you know his own

377.6 --> 383.03900000000004
but i watch the videos afterwards on

380.479 --> 383.039
youtube

383.28 --> 387.11999999999995
so check it out

392.639 --> 409.84000000000003
and he has other platforms too out there

410.4 --> 413.75899999999996
he hates their hats

415.84 --> 423.84
not here who what

431.759 --> 435.039
are you talking about owen he doesn't

434.319 --> 438.96000000000004
bash

435.039 --> 438.96
bash hats he just makes

439.12 --> 444.4
fun of the correlating behavior

444.8 --> 448.0
kind of like what we do with

448.08 --> 455.35999999999996
with trencher ballers right

452.16 --> 455.36
very similar pattern

455.44 --> 458.479
it's just grappler

462.08 --> 468.87899999999996
you bought his stupid app he had an app

466.08 --> 468.87899999999996
i don't know man

475.12 --> 480.96
predatory app just takes your money or

477.68 --> 483.52
wasn't it intended

480.96 --> 486.08
to gather funds i i don't know man i

483.52 --> 493.84
haven't engaged with any of that i

486.08 --> 493.84
i just watch his shows right

506.4 --> 510.87899999999996
right so it i i don't know man what i

508.96 --> 515.4399999999999
get out of it if you want to support him

510.879 --> 517.36
in whatever way that's

515.44 --> 519.36
you supporting him and if you then kind

517.36 --> 522.399
of but i didn't get what i

519.36 --> 525.6
expected out of it well

522.399 --> 530.08
maybe you shouldn't have and just

525.6 --> 530.08
looked at the whole thing right

530.88 --> 537.68
like i i can still

534.24 --> 537.6800000000001
watch his shows

538.24 --> 541.92
now on d life i would throw lemons at

540.56 --> 546.0799999999999
him

541.92 --> 548.24
but yeah other than that

546.08 --> 550.48
i haven't even supported or anything so

548.24 --> 554.0
i don't know what the issue is

550.48 --> 556.9590000000001
like you buy his apps

554.0 --> 558.959
whatever that is if that even is his app

556.959 --> 562.3199999999999
or some other

558.959 --> 563.1199999999999
bear or person posing as a i don't know

562.32 --> 565.0400000000001
what happened

563.12 --> 566.5600000000001
okay i don't know anything about these

565.04 --> 568.7199999999999
details so

566.56 --> 569.68
i just know that owen benjamin doesn't

568.72 --> 576.48
appreciate

569.68 --> 578.3199999999999
people being all victory about it

576.48 --> 580.5600000000001
because there have been some grifters

578.32 --> 581.839
kind of like getting in between the

580.56 --> 585.4399999999999
bears

581.839 --> 588.0
and doing [Â __Â ] as well talks about it

585.44 --> 588.0
all the time

588.839 --> 591.839
so

592.88 --> 596.8
there hasn't been a deal yeah because he

594.72 --> 599.12
was banned there they don't let him on

596.8 --> 605.8389999999999
again

599.12 --> 605.839
i know

607.92 --> 614.8
i wait you really didn't know

611.519 --> 617.2
that he was just there on bit shoot

614.8 --> 618.0
i mean he doesn't live stream there it

617.2 --> 622.88
just uploads

618.0 --> 622.88
it afterwards but i mean

624.72 --> 630.0790000000001
i've been referencing owen benjamin

628.079 --> 632.079
regularly and i have said that it is on

630.079 --> 635.92
bitchute so

632.079 --> 639.76
i don't see the problem like

635.92 --> 639.76
yeah he's been banned all over the place

640.24 --> 644.9590000000001
then he came back he went to d live got

642.959 --> 645.3599999999999
banned then he started to do his tea

644.959 --> 649.4399999999999
time

645.36 --> 650.88
project and then he got banned and his

649.44 --> 652.8000000000001
next account

650.88 --> 654.399
that next attempt immediately also got

652.8 --> 656.8
banned and yeah

654.399 --> 659.6
so he stopped doing that again but he's

656.8 --> 662.16
still there on bitchute

659.6 --> 664.5600000000001
and he's engaging in other platforms as

662.16 --> 666.8
well to upload things

664.56 --> 666.8
so

671.519 --> 675.839
why is he banned on d live i don't know

679.36 --> 683.519
i mean he has many different things on

682.32 --> 687.36
his repertoire right

683.519 --> 690.079
many different jokes that are

687.36 --> 692.24
sacred cow slaughterhouse related and

690.079 --> 694.56
yeah

692.24 --> 697.519
once one of these jokes comes by again

694.56 --> 699.8389999999999
there's people just on these platforms

697.519 --> 701.12
that are just yeah squirting all over

699.839 --> 706.1600000000001
that it's like oh no that's

701.12 --> 706.16
too far you can't do that that's what

714.839 --> 717.839
happens

718.24 --> 722.32
david weiss yeah yeah no one did have a

720.639 --> 725.279
couple of meltdowns over it

722.32 --> 726.1600000000001
definitely i was there when that

725.279 --> 731.8389999999999
happened

726.16 --> 731.8389999999999
it's fascinating

740.959 --> 745.8389999999999
hey anna meekin agm

758.24 --> 761.92
right so there should be a ball busters

761.12 --> 764.639
live

761.92 --> 764.639
this evening

765.04 --> 767.76
i'll be there

769.2 --> 772.32
looking forward to it hope i don't

771.6 --> 775.76
forget it

772.32 --> 787.839
again i had to get very distracted in

775.76 --> 787.8389999999999
this saturday evening

796.56 --> 802.079
nathan oakley i don't know i don't think

799.519 --> 802.079
it's funny

804.16 --> 809.519
you know the own benjamin just prefers

806.079 --> 812.8
that you send him letters

809.519 --> 814.079
with money in it or like things like

812.8 --> 817.519
silver coins or

814.079 --> 817.519
just stuff

817.76 --> 824.16
objects art you know

821.76 --> 824.88
he basically as part of the show unpacks

824.16 --> 826.8
that stuff

824.88 --> 828.88
all the time and reads letters it's what

826.8 --> 832.16
he does so that's what he

828.88 --> 835.519
that's what he's basically asking for

832.16 --> 835.519
all the other stuff is just

837.36 --> 844.9590000000001
side stuff and i don't think he has even

841.279 --> 848.32
a perfect full grip on it on all of it

844.959 --> 848.3199999999999
let's other people do that

849.279 --> 853.12
right he's not a programmer

853.68 --> 859.92
or maybe who knows maybe he's a little

856.8 --> 860.56
i don't know man he's a very talented

859.92 --> 871.56
guy so

860.56 --> 874.0
i think he could be if he chose to

871.56 --> 874.6389999999999
automarketable securities i don't know

874.0 --> 885.839
what that

874.639 --> 885.839
even means

897.519 --> 902.9590000000001
huh okay tony whitcomb that that sounds

900.72 --> 913.839
very typical

902.959 --> 913.8389999999999
was that recently

915.36 --> 919.519
they're having more water bubble issues

919.839 --> 927.839
at the iss hmm

933.759 --> 936.0790000000001
wait

937.279 --> 940.48
you're a countdown you mean you're

939.759 --> 946.24
banned from

940.48 --> 950.0
chat from youtube chat 306 or you mean

946.24 --> 954.32
from some platform of their own

950.0 --> 957.44
that you have to subscribe to

954.32 --> 957.44
tuesday night okay

963.839 --> 970.5600000000001
right in youtube chat okay

967.12 --> 970.5600000000001
yeah of course you know

971.6 --> 979.12
but dude like iss streams and nasa's

975.44 --> 979.12
live stream situations

979.92 --> 987.36
they're like puppetry

982.959 --> 990.959
right it's there to amuse

987.36 --> 993.36
children and to dream within the setting

990.959 --> 995.04
and yeah if you have a puppet show and

993.36 --> 997.44
there's like people watching the puppet

995.04 --> 1001.68
show it's obviously a puppet show

997.44 --> 1003.44
right they're gonna get maybe interested

1001.68 --> 1005.199
maybe they're interested in the voice of

1003.44 --> 1006.639
the puppeteer or whatever

1005.199 --> 1008.24
and they're gonna get with their minds

1006.639 --> 1010.48
into the story and have

1008.24 --> 1011.6800000000001
fun right if somebody's gonna be walk

1010.48 --> 1014.24
into the room like oh

1011.68 --> 1015.7589999999999
it's fake look there's a guy behind it

1014.24 --> 1017.44
yeah that's gonna be extremely

1015.759 --> 1018.24
disturbing so of course it's gonna be

1017.44 --> 1021.6800000000001
like dude

1018.24 --> 1023.279
get out of the puppet show don't ruin

1021.68 --> 1026.3999999999999
the act

1023.279 --> 1030.88
because that's what it's for

1026.4 --> 1030.88
for people to dream about space and

1032.079 --> 1034.24
so

1036.16 --> 1039.8390000000002
only seems logical

1041.52 --> 1048.16
right there's not any debating happening

1045.28 --> 1048.16
in the video

1049.44 --> 1054.559
you know look if if some nasa video like

1052.4 --> 1056.24
really started to ridicule flat earth

1054.559 --> 1059.2
like

1056.24 --> 1060.64
nasty like not just like oh ridiculous

1059.2 --> 1062.4
or as a joke

1060.64 --> 1064.0800000000002
but just really like attack flat

1062.4 --> 1067.919
earthers well if they would then

1064.08 --> 1069.039
ban people like getting frustrated with

1067.919 --> 1070.88
that and like

1069.039 --> 1072.8799999999999
trying to speak up and they're not gonna

1070.88 --> 1075.0390000000002
ban that

1072.88 --> 1076.7990000000002
because then they asked for it they

1075.039 --> 1079.36
basically did a thing

1076.799 --> 1081.12
that would invite a response an

1079.36 --> 1084.1599999999999
interaction

1081.12 --> 1086.0
but most nasa streams and iss

1084.16 --> 1089.1200000000001
they are not about that they're just

1086.0 --> 1092.16
about nice mellow song in the background

1089.12 --> 1094.799
and just look at space no

1092.16 --> 1096.0
and just like oh it's so awesome in chat

1094.799 --> 1099.52
bots saying that

1096.0 --> 1099.52
and probably people too

1099.919 --> 1106.4
right so it's just about

1104.24 --> 1107.679
creating that dream not necessarily

1106.4 --> 1110.4
about

1107.679 --> 1112.0800000000002
creating some kind of interaction right

1110.4 --> 1114.96
so yeah then they're going to ban you if

1112.08 --> 1116.799
you suddenly barge in there and start

1114.96 --> 1119.52
stomping around like an elephant in a

1116.799 --> 1123.84
porcelain room

1119.52 --> 1123.84
it's only logical

1124.4 --> 1126.799
anyway

1128.72 --> 1137.84
song is to put you to sleep

1131.84 --> 1137.84
right but people come there for that

1144.32 --> 1150.559
what do you think about how practical

1147.44 --> 1153.679
geothermal energy is

1150.559 --> 1153.6789999999999
i have no idea

1159.76 --> 1166.08
i think in ways it's very similar to

1163.039 --> 1169.12
nuclear energy it's just

1166.08 --> 1172.3999999999999
using heat continual heat

1169.12 --> 1174.7199999999998
for some in some form to

1172.4 --> 1176.72
boil water and then use the pressure it

1174.72 --> 1180.32
causes

1176.72 --> 1181.1200000000001
to get a a wheel rolling that generates

1180.32 --> 1183.04
electricity

1181.12 --> 1184.6399999999999
right so

1183.04 --> 1193.84
[Music]

1184.64 --> 1193.8400000000001
it's very close to that system

1195.2 --> 1202.0800000000002
what be happening happening

1198.24 --> 1204.4
what what be happening your way today

1202.08 --> 1204.3999999999999
what

1205.679 --> 1209.3600000000001
i don't know what you're talking about

1215.2 --> 1221.8400000000001
oh god what's my opinion on crypto it's

1225.52 --> 1235.84
it's very convoluted

1242.24 --> 1247.76
i i don't really want to get into that

1245.52 --> 1251.679
right now

1247.76 --> 1251.679
enough people already talking about it

1256.88 --> 1263.8400000000001
in a way it's like crypto

1260.48 --> 1263.84
is like an open casino

1264.08 --> 1271.12
for everybody and it's like condoned

1267.919 --> 1274.5590000000002
it's allowed to be

1271.12 --> 1277.84
transformed into money and even with a

1274.559 --> 1281.36
promise in the after

1277.84 --> 1282.0
that it could literally just be trusted

1281.36 --> 1285.6
to be

1282.0 --> 1285.6
exchangeable as a currency

1288.72 --> 1295.52
to get away from centralized control

1292.32 --> 1305.84
of money printing which is now the

1295.52 --> 1305.84
predominant financial force in the world

1313.039 --> 1319.6
but yeah it's in from what

1316.24 --> 1333.84
i got the feel of it it's still

1319.6 --> 1333.84
it's still tied in with max

1338.48 --> 1343.2
and they've already kind of showed that

1340.799 --> 1346.48
they can just manipulate things

1343.2 --> 1349.679
they can force fail

1346.48 --> 1354.08
for succeed something so they have

1349.679 --> 1354.0800000000002
control over it through their

1354.559 --> 1359.6
financial power in an indirect way they

1357.76 --> 1362.08
just choose to buy into something and

1359.6 --> 1364.7199999999998
then it gets all inflated

1362.08 --> 1364.72
propped up

1365.6 --> 1367.84
right

1370.799 --> 1374.0
so in that sense the bankers do have

1373.12 --> 1376.3999999999999
control with

1374.0 --> 1376.4
wealth

1378.24 --> 1383.6
with their financial power anyway it's

1381.6 --> 1389.84
very superficial there's there's better

1383.6 --> 1389.84
people to ask about this sort of thing

1409.36 --> 1415.4399999999998
cosmo sapien what

1413.36 --> 1417.84
an old trash youtube what what are you

1415.44 --> 1417.8400000000001
talking about

1442.84 --> 1445.84
so

1449.2 --> 1455.3600000000001
oh life's yeah right well why

1452.24 --> 1459.84
why spend your time there

1455.36 --> 1459.84
are you learning anything from it

1461.039 --> 1464.72
like i find those things really really

1463.679 --> 1468.24
boring

1464.72 --> 1473.84
now because the tricks already

1468.24 --> 1473.84
ruined to me you know

1497.279 --> 1501.84
was ghostwriting what

1503.279 --> 1506.48
what is ghost riding

1510.159 --> 1515.8400000000001
so his car cut out of control and just

1512.0 --> 1515.84
went over the hill okay

1519.679 --> 1529.8400000000001
hey seeking star wars good to see you

1552.0 --> 1561.84
oh okay

1556.4 --> 1561.8400000000001
ghost riding it's like with an open door

1564.88 --> 1569.6000000000001
and you're walking with it so like

1567.679 --> 1570.799
potentially pushing the car or whatever

1569.6 --> 1572.6
i don't know

1570.799 --> 1573.9189999999999
right

1572.6 --> 1585.84
[Music]

1573.919 --> 1585.8400000000001
i'm afraid of ghosts right

1587.76 --> 1591.44
it's better than goat writing

1595.12 --> 1599.84
code writing for children

1611.08 --> 1614.1999999999998
[Music]

1628.48 --> 1632.88
okay eddie bravo fanboy sounds good

1633.6 --> 1641.84
right like i when i say like okay this

1637.279 --> 1644.0
all seems a bit like a

1641.84 --> 1646.72
some kind of a casino thing the crypto

1644.0 --> 1647.44
and that the banker still can manipulate

1646.72 --> 1649.76
things

1647.44 --> 1651.6000000000001
right that doesn't mean that people that

1649.76 --> 1655.12
are going to engage in

1651.6 --> 1656.1589999999999
in trying out kind of specializing in

1655.12 --> 1658.799
crypto that they're

1656.159 --> 1659.6000000000001
automatically going to do a bad job i'm

1658.799 --> 1661.44
not saying that

1659.6 --> 1663.6789999999999
i'm pretty sure there are people that

1661.44 --> 1666.72
are like really

1663.679 --> 1666.72
informed about it

1667.52 --> 1672.799
and like have a real feel for it i'm not

1669.84 --> 1672.799
one of those people

1674.0 --> 1680.88
right so yes there will be

1677.279 --> 1683.84
people coming out of it very wealthy

1680.88 --> 1683.8400000000001
probably

1685.919 --> 1697.8400000000001
but yeah they're gonna give it their all

1704.32 --> 1710.96
most goats just eat the paper it's

1706.72 --> 1713.6000000000001
written one goat math

1710.96 --> 1715.76
is what okay this is getting really

1713.6 --> 1718.48
weird now

1715.76 --> 1718.48
go to math

1720.559 --> 1724.72
how many million truthers are there in

1722.48 --> 1728.799
the world now

1724.72 --> 1733.52
well what exactly does that mean

1728.799 --> 1738.24
truthers about what i mean

1733.52 --> 1740.72
there are a lot of different tiers of

1738.24 --> 1740.72
truther

1741.039 --> 1745.52
it it's not really logical to average

1744.64 --> 1749.039
out like a

1745.52 --> 1751.279
really super spiritually awake truth or

1749.039 --> 1752.0
versus somebody that has caught on like

1751.279 --> 1755.84
okay maybe

1752.0 --> 1755.84
politicians are lying right

1761.12 --> 1768.4799999999998
no not tears with ea

1765.44 --> 1773.6000000000001
tears e

1768.48 --> 1773.6
i mean i e a god

1777.6 --> 1783.76
i e that's it

1781.44 --> 1783.76
right

1788.32 --> 1796.96
many different stairs on the staircase

1793.039 --> 1800.1589999999999
or oh yeah the ladder

1796.96 --> 1800.96
whatever you want to and visualize it

1800.159 --> 1809.8400000000001
like

1800.96 --> 1809.8400000000001
anyway i'd say there are definitely

1815.679 --> 1821.919
let's when it comes to really low tier

1818.799 --> 1824.96
awakening i think that more than half of

1821.919 --> 1828.64
the world is actually

1824.96 --> 1830.64
arrived to that stage it's just that

1828.64 --> 1832.24
they're not really doing a lot with it

1830.64 --> 1837.8400000000001
just yet

1832.24 --> 1837.84
because it because of the backlash

1839.12 --> 1843.84
and what they've been lured into before

1841.679 --> 1845.039
that and they pulling out of it and then

1843.84 --> 1846.6399999999999
they're going to have to deal with the

1845.039 --> 1850.08
scars of all that right

1846.64 --> 1853.3600000000001
so preoccupation lower tier

1850.08 --> 1856.48
awakening but yeah

1853.36 --> 1859.519
billions with the b

1856.48 --> 1862.96
well when it comes to like ultra awake

1859.519 --> 1865.039
it's so hard to size up because

1862.96 --> 1866.799
it becomes kind of compartmentalized

1865.039 --> 1868.8799999999999
eventually like people become

1866.799 --> 1870.399
super awake and specialized about

1868.88 --> 1873.3600000000001
certain things

1870.399 --> 1874.399
and other things neighboring it in lore

1873.36 --> 1875.9189999999999
and all that

1874.399 --> 1877.76
but then other things will remain

1875.919 --> 1879.1200000000001
completely cut off

1877.76 --> 1881.44
from them they're like they can't get

1879.12 --> 1884.2399999999998
over it and other people

1881.44 --> 1884.72
would then specialize in that but they'd

1884.24 --> 1887.84
have

1884.72 --> 1890.159
issues with other details that other

1887.84 --> 1890.1589999999999
people

1890.72 --> 1898.72
don't know yeah how to do it

1895.6 --> 1902.399
so it's really tough to

1898.72 --> 1905.1200000000001
get a genuine reading so it's really

1902.399 --> 1905.5189999999998
tough to size because like qualities do

1905.12 --> 1908.7199999999998
show

1905.519 --> 1911.519
in higher tiers of awakening

1908.72 --> 1913.919
but then that's no longer the standard

1911.519 --> 1914.3990000000001
to really measure like how awakened they

1913.919 --> 1916.64
are

1914.399 --> 1919.039
it becomes more about the balance of the

1916.64 --> 1922.88
flaws

1919.039 --> 1922.8799999999999
and the insight and how

1923.6 --> 1930.799
they are attempting

1926.96 --> 1932.88
to basically transform that

1930.799 --> 1934.0
towards the future to actually

1932.88 --> 1936.72
overcoming what

1934.0 --> 1937.919
they know are their flaws in some way

1936.72 --> 1940.88
anyway

1937.919 --> 1942.64
getting a little complicated right but i

1940.88 --> 1944.7990000000002
think that

1942.64 --> 1947.279
yeah the super awakened i don't even

1944.799 --> 1953.12
know if that's a million

1947.279 --> 1953.12
could be spread around the world

1960.559 --> 1963.84
maybe much less

1965.2 --> 1969.1200000000001
i'm not even sure like how high on the

1967.36 --> 1972.6399999999999
scale that i am

1969.12 --> 1976.0
i just know i forged

1972.64 --> 1978.64
i guess somehow my subconscious

1976.0 --> 1981.36
in the past foresaw this forged this

1978.64 --> 1984.64
specific skill

1981.36 --> 1987.6789999999999
to kind of try to attain even a higher

1984.64 --> 1991.8400000000001
awakening and potentially help the rest

1987.679 --> 1991.8400000000001
of the world with it

1993.44 --> 1998.3990000000001
right so to me i'm not even really

1996.72 --> 1999.1200000000001
interested in like a pecking order

1998.399 --> 2001.6
because then

1999.12 --> 2002.799
you you turn back to savannah syndrome

2001.6 --> 2006.0
then it becomes like no

2002.799 --> 2010.32
i am the most i am the most

2006.0 --> 2013.679
awakened i am the suspicious boy

2010.32 --> 2014.399
that's like no no you're gonna run into

2013.679 --> 2017.8400000000001
somebody

2014.399 --> 2018.399
that's gonna prove you wrong and just

2017.84 --> 2021.36
and

2018.399 --> 2024.559
developing talent or developing skills

2021.36 --> 2028.1589999999999
it's always a balance between it

2024.559 --> 2028.1589999999999
never seen an exception to this

2028.799 --> 2032.559
now wherever the balance lies whether

2030.799 --> 2034.72
it's really towards the

2032.559 --> 2037.519
productive creative side or whether it's

2034.72 --> 2047.84
more to the destructive side

2037.519 --> 2047.84
that differs greatly

2050.32 --> 2061.839
what are you all right this is live here

2055.52 --> 2061.839
what are you guys

2075.919 --> 2082.399
what are you talking about nathan ugly

2078.8 --> 2082.3990000000003
what eric are you talking about

2085.599 --> 2089.839
tears yes

2099.68 --> 2103.359
it's no when i say safanye i don't even

2102.96 --> 2106.64
mean

2103.359 --> 2106.64
eric the bay anymore

2106.96 --> 2112.079
it's just an original example it's

2113.68 --> 2117.839
i gotta call it something

2123.44 --> 2129.599
so every time i say that i don't

2126.48 --> 2130.32
mean eric debay when i'm talking about a

2129.599 --> 2133.599
certain

2130.32 --> 2136.6400000000003
about a syndrome or about effects or

2133.599 --> 2138.56
risks and i say savannah syndrome i'm

2136.64 --> 2139.839
not talking about okay i'm gonna compare

2138.56 --> 2142.7999999999997
it to eric dubay

2139.839 --> 2146.24
okay that's not what i mean with that

2142.8 --> 2149.2000000000003
even though some people might literally

2146.24 --> 2151.9199999999996
like shadow mention him by calling him

2149.2 --> 2159.839
savage as they talk about a person

2151.92 --> 2159.839
i don't do that you might have noticed

2161.839 --> 2168.7999999999997
although i have basically yeah

2165.04 --> 2170.079
tried to analyze who i think eric dubay

2168.8 --> 2172.079
is and

2170.079 --> 2175.8390000000004
what his issues are and what his talents

2172.079 --> 2179.04
are so yeah i have analyzed him but

2175.839 --> 2179.68
i don't see a reason to really like pick

2179.04 --> 2182.72
on him

2179.68 --> 2182.72
for his weaknesses

2183.599 --> 2187.52
like i think that he might grow out of

2185.52 --> 2190.48
it

2187.52 --> 2190.48
might be mistaken

2190.72 --> 2198.839
i'm just willing to

2193.839 --> 2201.839
to consider that possibility right

2198.839 --> 2201.839
anyway

2211.2 --> 2215.839
ufo disclosure

2225.52 --> 2243.839
right good servant yeah he made some

2227.68 --> 2243.839
good videos

2247.92 --> 2250.2400000000002
whoa

2251.2 --> 2257.4399999999996
the terret that would be something man

2254.16 --> 2261.44
nathan oakley and eddie bravo together

2257.44 --> 2261.44
against neil degrasse tyson and tow

2263.599 --> 2267.2000000000003
why doesn't eric debate like you i don't

2266.16 --> 2270.16
know if he likes

2267.2 --> 2271.9199999999996
doesn't he like me has he expressed in

2270.16 --> 2273.7599999999998
chat rooms or whatever

2271.92 --> 2274.96
or even on streams that he doesn't like

2273.76 --> 2277.2000000000003
i don't know man

2274.96 --> 2279.68
i just remember that much more in the

2277.2 --> 2279.68
beginning

2279.76 --> 2286.1600000000003
he like started to comment calling me a

2282.88 --> 2286.1600000000003
crypto jew and [Â __Â ]

2287.2 --> 2291.4399999999996
for being i don't know defensive against

2290.16 --> 2294.24
jews

2291.44 --> 2294.2400000000002
and yeah

2294.88 --> 2298.88
and i got trolled after that but i'm not

2297.92 --> 2302.2400000000002
even 100

2298.88 --> 2302.88
sure that was like his trolls i don't

2302.24 --> 2304.4799999999996
know

2302.88 --> 2313.839
i don't know what he thinks about i

2304.48 --> 2313.839
don't know if he even remembers me

2316.96 --> 2321.839
he has only called me a crypto jew

2324.839 --> 2327.839
but

2330.88 --> 2334.32
what the heck is a crypto jew

2334.56 --> 2337.599
well i don't i'm basically paraphrasing

2337.04 --> 2340.4
i'm not

2337.599 --> 2341.04
a hundred percent sure whether he

2340.4 --> 2343.119
literally

2341.04 --> 2344.88
said the word crypto due in his comment

2343.119 --> 2347.599
i don't remember it's like a long time

2344.88 --> 2347.599
years ago

2348.4 --> 2351.28
comment section

2352.839 --> 2359.2
but like a crypto jew

2356.079 --> 2363.28
how i see that is like somebody that's

2359.2 --> 2363.2799999999997
like secretly trying to be a jew

2365.359 --> 2368.64
right the idea i think is actually kind

2368.079 --> 2372.6400000000003
of

2368.64 --> 2372.64
funny and fascinating in a way

2373.76 --> 2377.44
like i would i'd like i'm secretly

2376.24 --> 2380.72
trying to be a jew

2377.44 --> 2385.359
guys i have a secret small hat

2380.72 --> 2385.359
start somewhere in a safe

2389.76 --> 2397.8390000000004
but yeah it's i don't know

2398.32 --> 2404.48
the crap told you the jewish ridler oh

2401.44 --> 2404.48
my god nathan

2409.04 --> 2413.04
he hasn't said nothing bad other than

2411.2 --> 2415.7599999999998
that

2413.04 --> 2416.8
well look good servant the thing was

2415.76 --> 2419.0400000000004
years ago

2416.8 --> 2420.7200000000003
right and now talking like even before

2419.04 --> 2422.319
the flat earth debate started

2420.72 --> 2425.359
because yeah there's a history before

2422.319 --> 2427.52
that there was a lot of trolling

2425.359 --> 2428.64
back and forth in fighting between flat

2427.52 --> 2430.88
earthers

2428.64 --> 2432.0789999999997
and eric the bay was like really going

2430.88 --> 2436.079
after

2432.079 --> 2437.44
the potato crowd like he was like a

2436.079 --> 2442.1600000000003
predominant player in

2437.44 --> 2445.52
infighting and that was all just

2442.16 --> 2448.56
terrible behavior it worsened

2445.52 --> 2452.8
morale they all become became

2448.56 --> 2455.839
more savonia more gamma more trollish

2452.8 --> 2459.04
his crowd and

2455.839 --> 2459.7599999999998
i don't know if they ever recovered from

2459.04 --> 2461.839
this

2459.76 --> 2464.8390000000004
because i don't hear i don't see them

2461.839 --> 2466.48
going around doing that [Â __Â ] anymore

2464.839 --> 2468.72
though

2466.48 --> 2469.839
you know that's something that i have

2468.72 --> 2472.0
taken note of so

2469.839 --> 2473.52
who knows he might have just stopped

2472.0 --> 2474.96
doing that and is now

2473.52 --> 2477.119
getting more serious or something i

2474.96 --> 2479.599
don't know i don't follow him

2477.119 --> 2482.88
i don't see like a daily stream or a

2479.599 --> 2482.88
weekly stream from him

2484.72 --> 2491.2799999999997
i just see him upload certain

2488.16 --> 2494.96
explanation videos every now and then

2491.28 --> 2496.079
that's it i don't know what else he's

2494.96 --> 2499.2
doing

2496.079 --> 2502.4
or what like his forum activity

2499.2 --> 2502.3999999999996
is i don't know

2505.44 --> 2508.48
how many years has effie early burning

2507.599 --> 2511.52
feb

2508.48 --> 2511.52
been going on

2512.16 --> 2516.72

eric went quiet and when he worked on

2633.2 --> 2649.839
his leveled video okay

2658.96 --> 2665.839
yeah hey nathan you can brag about

2662.4 --> 2667.52
being a crypto hindu and then how you're

2665.839 --> 2668.72
at a higher caste but you do realize

2667.52 --> 2671.119
that the higher caste

2668.72 --> 2673.52
actually have to financially provide for

2671.119 --> 2677.359

3062.88 --> 3066.8
coffee machine and make coffee with

3066.839 --> 3069.839
it

3080.839 --> 3086.16

staying on the debt thank you very much

3136.839 --> 3143.68
man

3139.119 --> 3143.6800000000003
what andrew

3147.44 --> 3153.839
more flavor that way right

3150.64 --> 3153.839
let's just make it fresh

3154.079 --> 3159.44
i get it grind it up i i know i could

3157.52 --> 3162.319
probably get a grinder and then grind

3159.44 --> 3165.44
the beans myself

3162.319 --> 3167.839
might be even better but

3165.44 --> 3168.8
yeah they grinded up powder i store it

3167.839 --> 3172.16
in the fridge

3168.8 --> 3172.1600000000003
like in the ice

3174.72 --> 3179.4399999999996
and it's completely vacuum sealed and

3177.68 --> 3182.5589999999997
all that

3179.44 --> 3186.8
and then yeah when i'm through the

3182.559 --> 3190.6400000000003
coffee grinds i refill it

3186.8 --> 3193.599
and it's you can yeah i i don't know how

3190.64 --> 3194.8799999999997
long you can keep coffee in in the

3193.599 --> 3197.44
fridge

3194.88 --> 3198.1600000000003
in between the ice but i think yeah that

3197.44 --> 3201.2000000000003
could be a

3198.16 --> 3203.839
very long time without

3201.2 --> 3206.5589999999997
really ruining it too much as long as

3203.839 --> 3208.48
it's completely vacuum sealed

3206.559 --> 3211.0400000000004
i'm not sure though i've never actually

3208.48 --> 3213.2
really tested it

3211.04 --> 3214.16
for extreme long periods i think the

3213.2 --> 3217.7599999999998
longest i've

3214.16 --> 3219.68
done once was like a year

3217.76 --> 3221.2000000000003
because i had forgotten it because it

3219.68 --> 3224.48
was kind of like covered up

3221.2 --> 3227.7599999999998
by excess ice snowy stuff

3224.48 --> 3231.28
so i had forgotten about it but even

3227.76 --> 3232.3190000000004
yeah that was just fine it seemed a

3231.28 --> 3235.76
little extra

3232.319 --> 3251.839
dry though but

3235.76 --> 3251.8390000000004
anyway coffee

3251.92 --> 3256.16
pre-ground has bugs what

3258.079 --> 3265.2000000000003
uh no

3261.68 --> 3266.8799999999997
you know why because where i get the

3265.2 --> 3271.2799999999997
pre-ground

3266.88 --> 3274.4
they literally tap the beans

3271.28 --> 3276.079
into a little bucket and then they grind

3274.4 --> 3279.839
them on the spot

3276.079 --> 3279.8390000000004
right there's no bugs in there

3282.4 --> 3290.319
right never so this is not some

3287.28 --> 3292.4
machine factory packaged

3290.319 --> 3294.799
free grinded coffee now this is

3292.4 --> 3295.44
literally grinded on the spot then put

3294.799 --> 3299.7599999999998
in a bag

3295.44 --> 3307.839
vacuum sealed that's how i buy it

3299.76 --> 3307.8390000000004
all organic by the way

3336.16 --> 3343.839
right pre-packaged yeah well

3339.359 --> 3347.5989999999997
yeah andrew it all depends just on the

3343.839 --> 3349.839
production quality and how cleanly they

3347.599 --> 3349.839
are

3350.48 --> 3355.76
right if it's super large scale like

3353.52 --> 3358.0
they literally have like conveyor belts

3355.76 --> 3361.119
with just

3358.0 --> 3362.839
kilos and kilos of coffee beans being

3361.119 --> 3366.96
grinded

3362.839 --> 3370.24
systematically like a second

3366.96 --> 3372.48
yeah there will [Â __Â ] will slip through

3370.24 --> 3372.4799999999996
right

3373.599 --> 3377.52
if it's smaller scale that's less likely

3376.0 --> 3380.48
especially if there's just people

3377.52 --> 3382.16
constantly checking they have a lot of

3380.48 --> 3384.16
failsafes for it

3382.16 --> 3385.44
but i don't know man i don't know how

3384.16 --> 3389.04
far

3385.44 --> 3391.839
like that is advanced

3389.04 --> 3392.88
in factory machinery it does develop you

3391.839 --> 3395.44
know it does do

3392.88 --> 3396.0
they do develop these things and get

3395.44 --> 3400.16
more

3396.0 --> 3403.44
fail-safe systems and all that but

3400.16 --> 3406.3999999999996
yeah if it's just done by hand or

3403.44 --> 3407.92
well a machine does it but a person does

3406.4 --> 3410.559
it on the spot

3407.92 --> 3413.04
from being to grind then yeah that's

3410.559 --> 3416.8390000000004
pretty safe too it's really easy

3413.04 --> 3418.319
so they it's just a service from the

3416.839 --> 3421.599
shop

3418.319 --> 3424.48
it's a special coffee coffee store

3421.599 --> 3424.48
not a coffee shop

3425.44 --> 3431.2000000000003
anyway yeah i don't know so the

3429.2 --> 3432.5589999999997
prepackaged coffee it all depends on

3431.2 --> 3437.68
just like

3432.559 --> 3440.88
where what are the the safeguards

3437.68 --> 3440.8799999999997
what are the standards

3442.559 --> 3447.599
like who's running it do they actually

3445.599 --> 3448.88
care about the quality are they just

3447.599 --> 3451.28
trying to

3448.88 --> 3453.52
strangle the company to to squeeze more

3451.28 --> 3461.8390000000004
money from it for themselves you know

3453.52 --> 3461.839
all these things all play a role

3485.04 --> 3489.839
beans and large silos right

3509.92 --> 3517.52
what oh

3513.119 --> 3520.0
iron 26 that's weird

3517.52 --> 3521.7599999999998
monkeys is it really monkeys i thought

3520.0 --> 3531.839
it was like

3521.76 --> 3544.559
goat no could be goats they they grinded

3531.839 --> 3559.839
i don't know popey luwak

3544.559 --> 3559.8390000000004
yeah some weird practices man

3560.9 --> 3564.1890000000003
[Music]

3576.24 --> 3580.319
yeah george sanford i'm not really

3578.0 --> 3582.319
worried about a few bucks

3580.319 --> 3584.799
you know when you get fresh organic

3582.319 --> 3584.799
salad

3584.96 --> 3591.44
or your own car there's always like bugs

3589.04 --> 3593.52
you know like even really small ones and

3591.44 --> 3596.799
it just doesn't really matter

3593.52 --> 3598.4
try to wash it off but you're going to

3596.799 --> 3600.799
be eating a bug

3598.4 --> 3602.96
and not really big ones because you'll

3600.799 --> 3605.119
of course spot those you'd be crazy not

3602.96 --> 3605.119
to

3605.76 --> 3615.8390000000004
but yeah that's that's just nature dude

3610.64 --> 3615.839
don't be afraid

3620.0 --> 3623.599
that's that's crazy adam

3624.48 --> 3626.799
what

3627.68 --> 3631.44
like how how did they come up with that

3630.72 --> 3634.48
[Â __Â ]

3631.44 --> 3634.48
that's just crazy

3638.16 --> 3641.52
and what like do they freaking force

3640.24 --> 3645.04
feed the cats

3641.52 --> 3646.96
like that like how is a cat gonna

3645.04 --> 3650.5589999999997
swallow beans

3646.96 --> 3650.559
that makes no freaking sense

3650.64 --> 3655.2799999999997
he's not gonna do that on his own

3652.24 --> 3658.24
volition so that seems like it could be

3655.28 --> 3659.52
part of a pretty nasty process kind of

3658.24 --> 3663.5989999999997
like how

3659.52 --> 3663.599
gooses are force fed and [Â __Â ]

3668.839 --> 3671.839
ugh

3682.0 --> 3689.119
no andrew that all depends on

3685.68 --> 3689.1189999999997
if the spiders and you have an

3696.839 --> 3699.839
understanding

3702.799 --> 3708.4
if you radiate in a certain way

3705.839 --> 3711.359
then even insects except for mosquitoes

3708.4 --> 3714.559
because they don't give a [Â __Â ]

3711.359 --> 3714.5589999999997
they see you as prey

3714.88 --> 3719.599
even bugs will just respect you they're

3717.2 --> 3727.839
not gonna crawl in your mouth

3719.599 --> 3727.839
that's just creepy crawly talks

3731.52 --> 3735.68
like why would they you think they don't

3734.96 --> 3739.839
know that's

3735.68 --> 3743.1189999999997
actually like an orifice of a living

3739.839 --> 3746.72
big animal with body heat

3743.119 --> 3746.7200000000003
it makes no freaking sense man

3752.319 --> 3760.16
plastic rice ew

3756.0 --> 3769.839
what no i've never heard of that

3760.16 --> 3769.839
sounds ridiculous

3778.0 --> 3784.4
also yeah in a way that should be very

3781.28 --> 3784.4
easily spottable

3784.64 --> 3792.5589999999997
because plastic is not gonna sink

3788.0 --> 3796.16
in water and it's not gonna soften up

3792.559 --> 3798.3190000000004
either so if you got freaking plastic

3796.16 --> 3800.16
rice in between your rice ridiculous

3798.319 --> 3802.079
idea you're gonna cook it

3800.16 --> 3804.72
it's just gonna keep on floating on

3802.079 --> 3807.599
there unchanged

3804.72 --> 3808.839
as everything else like well does what

3807.599 --> 3811.839
rice does

3808.839 --> 3811.839
so

3814.72 --> 3822.3999999999996
well bkk dave that is one of the

3819.599 --> 3825.839
most grably stupid self-destructive

3822.4 --> 3825.839
things i've ever heard

3836.319 --> 3841.44
i i don't see like

3842.559 --> 3849.92
why what they want to make people

3847.68 --> 3851.359
internationally become aware of that and

3849.92 --> 3853.599
then literally stop

3851.359 --> 3854.72
buying one of their main products why

3853.599 --> 3857.76
the [Â __Â ]

3854.72 --> 3857.7599999999998
would they ever do that

3859.039 --> 3862.7200000000003
that's literally shooting in your own

3861.119 --> 3867.839
foot

3862.72 --> 3867.839
market wise

3872.0 --> 3875.119
because they are okay well if you said

3874.559 --> 3881.8390000000004
it

3875.119 --> 3881.839
right that must be true then

3889.119 --> 3895.839
google it now

3916.72 --> 3923.359
what stomach has basically turned

3919.839 --> 3937.839
into plastic what

3923.359 --> 3937.839
what does that mean

3939.039 --> 3951.8390000000004
okay thanks for that link

3952.64 --> 3957.359
bouncing rice balls really

3957.839 --> 3966.72
it's plastic because bouncy rice balls

3962.319 --> 3966.72
you gotta be [Â __Â ] me dude

3966.799 --> 3975.52
cooked rice is bouncy as [Â __Â ]

3970.4 --> 3978.559
that's that is so mind-numbingly dumb

3975.52 --> 3980.24
oh my god

3978.559 --> 3982.6400000000003
i'm kind of disappointed i thought it

3980.24 --> 3985.839
would have been

3982.64 --> 3993.839
smarter thought out god

3985.839 --> 3993.839
anyway i'll be back in two minutes

4032.839 --> 4035.839
so

4046.839 --> 4049.839
so

4087.68 --> 4092.72
yeah yeah you see the thing about

4090.16 --> 4092.72
plastic

4093.359 --> 4097.039
it doesn't really bounce

4097.4 --> 4107.679
rubber bounces

4104.08 --> 4107.679
it makes no sense dude

4116.839 --> 4122.159
right

4118.319 --> 4122.159000000001
a solid plastic bowl

4122.319 --> 4126.4800000000005
i don't see that really bouncing all

4124.56 --> 4128.0
that much you know like things like ping

4126.48 --> 4130.239
pong balls

4128.0 --> 4131.759
they are plastic sort of i don't know

4130.239 --> 4134.879999999999
exactly what material it is

4131.759 --> 4138.239
but it is some sort of plastic

4134.88 --> 4141.679
it's air though in there

4138.239 --> 4145.12
yeah that's that kind of bounces

4141.679 --> 4146.2390000000005
on hard surfaces right that's plastic

4145.12 --> 4149.599999999999
but uh

4146.239 --> 4153.2789999999995
other than that most balls

4149.6 --> 4154.08
are either like rubber or some kind of a

4153.279 --> 4158.159000000001
leather

4154.08 --> 4161.44
thing with air in it

4158.159 --> 4165.2789999999995
so i don't see like the bouncing

4161.44 --> 4165.2789999999995
rice balls means it's plastic

4167.92 --> 4177.709
come on really

4174.55 --> 4177.709
[Music]

4183.35 --> 4186.4890000000005
[Music]

4186.839 --> 4189.839
so

4214.8 --> 4221.92
okay well tony whitcomb look if it's

4218.159 --> 4225.599999999999
if it's that one

4221.92 --> 4228.32
was it like jamaican woman bouncing a

4225.6 --> 4232.8
rice ball

4228.32 --> 4237.199
and then yeah

4232.8 --> 4240.320000000001
that means that one person

4237.199 --> 4244.799999999999
in the world got played with a practical

4240.32 --> 4247.04
joke somebody gave them weird rice

4244.8 --> 4247.92
or something that isn't actually right

4247.04 --> 4251.28
it's like

4247.92 --> 4252.56
like a ex yeah pretty advanced practical

4251.28 --> 4254.5599999999995
joke

4252.56 --> 4256.320000000001
maybe they really didn't like them for

4254.56 --> 4260.159000000001
some reason

4256.32 --> 4264.33
how does that equate to the chinese

4260.159 --> 4266.639999999999
are making plastic rice

4264.33 --> 4270.84
[Music]

4266.64 --> 4273.84
serious how does it get to that point

4270.84 --> 4273.84
guys

4299.6 --> 4303.360000000001
yeah company name yeah

4303.6 --> 4311.360000000001
how does that prevent somebody

4308.48 --> 4313.759999999999
from pulling a real big practical joke

4311.36 --> 4317.04
on them

4313.76 --> 4322.8
you know it's not that difficult to just

4317.04 --> 4325.84
take like a bag of rice

4322.8 --> 4329.12
or even just go to the factory and

4325.84 --> 4332.4800000000005
like snatch a

4329.12 --> 4335.679
pre prefab bag

4332.48 --> 4339.199
that's not been sealed yet just put your

4335.679 --> 4341.92
weird rice in it seal it up

4339.199 --> 4342.639999999999
maybe even in the freaking factory right

4341.92 --> 4346.159
in secret

4342.64 --> 4346.159000000001
just a worker going in there

4347.52 --> 4351.4400000000005
pulling a prank making a special bag

4350.32 --> 4354.159
with weird product

4351.44 --> 4354.879999999999
right so how does that equate oh that

4354.159 --> 4358.4
means it's

4354.88 --> 4362.0
all so where are all these

4358.4 --> 4364.48
freaking people reporting having

4362.0 --> 4366.0
like weird bouncy rice or it's really

4364.48 --> 4369.759999999999
unhealthy

4366.0 --> 4372.0
like if it's just this one woman

4369.76 --> 4374.159000000001
why would you assume that it's like all

4372.0 --> 4377.36
the products

4374.159 --> 4377.36
from that factory

4378.08 --> 4381.36
i i don't see it guys

4382.32 --> 4386.32
anyway yeah see you later i'm 26.

4391.199 --> 4396.4
all right tony whitcomb because if it

4393.52 --> 4399.6
wasn't a joke

4396.4 --> 4402.08
then where like oh

4399.6 --> 4404.0
it's just that one person like everybody

4402.08 --> 4406.12
else is just going to eat that

4404.0 --> 4407.44
not going to report that no

4406.12 --> 4410.88
hospitalizations

4407.44 --> 4413.5199999999995
nothing immediately

4410.88 --> 4416.0
right as soon as it this woman bought it

4413.52 --> 4419.6
off the shelf or whatever or

4416.0 --> 4419.6
was handed it by somebody

4420.8 --> 4425.360000000001
when she asked a store for you don't

4424.08 --> 4427.84
exactly know right

4425.36 --> 4429.679
it's very it's much more logical that it

4427.84 --> 4431.4400000000005
was just a practical joke because if it

4429.679 --> 4433.76
wasn't if it's like universal the

4431.44 --> 4436.639999999999
production of all that

4433.76 --> 4439.04
then there would be a whole bunch of

4436.64 --> 4439.04
people

4439.6 --> 4443.92
that would get the consequence of that

4441.6 --> 4447.76
and would be reporting about it

4443.92 --> 4447.76
right so that's how you can tell

4453.76 --> 4456.08
right

4462.56 --> 4470.4800000000005
thoughts on joe mcafee i think he's uh

4467.12 --> 4473.199
having a a permanent vacation from

4470.48 --> 4473.199
public life

4477.76 --> 4485.76
i've seen no conclusive

4481.12 --> 4485.76
lead to that he's actually dead

4486.08 --> 4491.04
but i do know that he was under great

4489.04 --> 4494.08
pressure he was trying to achieve

4491.04 --> 4494.08
all kinds of like

4495.52 --> 4502.96
power breaking developments right

4498.96 --> 4505.52
this guy was like a really anti

4502.96 --> 4507.679
globalist like actually having the

4505.52 --> 4511.040000000001
skills putting the d to the word

4507.679 --> 4513.1990000000005
not being perfect definitely not

4511.04 --> 4514.4
but he was like really making that

4513.199 --> 4516.32
effort and he had

4514.4 --> 4519.28
pretty good oversight over a whole bunch

4516.32 --> 4524.639999999999
of developments including cryptocurrency

4519.28 --> 4526.159
and he was probably trying to

4524.64 --> 4528.8
there's maybe still is maybe that's

4526.159 --> 4528.799999999999
still happening

4529.199 --> 4532.719
he was trying to take the power away

4531.52 --> 4535.92
from the gravelers

4532.719 --> 4539.52
right to re to oversimplify

4535.92 --> 4542.64
it and that either killed him

4539.52 --> 4543.679
or things got too hot became intangible

4542.64 --> 4546.400000000001
and he had to step

4543.679 --> 4547.36
out of the role and then faked his death

4546.4 --> 4550.5599999999995
maybe even in

4547.36 --> 4552.48
official fashion so

4550.56 --> 4555.679
not saying that he's not dead i'm just

4552.48 --> 4555.678999999999
saying i haven't seen

4555.92 --> 4560.08
yeah conclusive leads to that he might

4559.199 --> 4563.12
be dead

4560.08 --> 4563.12
just stories

4564.84 --> 4567.84
right

4569.64 --> 4572.709000000001
[Music]

4574.4 --> 4578.879999999999
well tony what come about the rice lady

4576.96 --> 4581.679
yeah well maybe she wasn't in on the

4578.88 --> 4584.32
joke

4581.679 --> 4585.4400000000005
and she was just really shocked by it

4584.32 --> 4588.799999999999
and thought that it was

4585.44 --> 4591.28
real and that didn't realize that

4588.8 --> 4592.96
it might have been a personal practical

4591.28 --> 4596.159
joke in some way

4592.96 --> 4599.36
still pretty nasty of course

4596.159 --> 4602.719
i'm not justifying that action

4599.36 --> 4605.12
however it happened but

4602.719 --> 4606.08
yeah she might not have known that it

4605.12 --> 4609.679
was

4606.08 --> 4612.0
just her because where's all the others

4609.679 --> 4614.64
right where's all the other people going

4612.0 --> 4617.84
on the internet like oh my god i just

4614.64 --> 4620.2390000000005
ate this rice i feel really sick

4617.84 --> 4620.88
look at this is wrong i can't show this

4620.239 --> 4622.718999999999
like

4620.88 --> 4625.12
nothing there's nothing out there right

4622.719 --> 4628.08
so yeah

4625.12 --> 4629.28
put all the evidence presented together

4628.08 --> 4632.0
a picture comes out

4629.28 --> 4633.759999999999
and until that picture becomes updated

4632.0 --> 4635.679
through new data

4633.76 --> 4637.92
there's certain conclusions you are

4635.679 --> 4643.12
bound to draw

4637.92 --> 4643.12
if you just approach it with pure logic

4646.32 --> 4651.84
enough with the rice

4673.52 --> 4679.84
no good servant the bible is not the

4676.32 --> 4682.96
only truth

4679.84 --> 4682.96
but it is truth

4683.679 --> 4693.84
it is in there absolutely

4687.52 --> 4693.84
and it applies

4694.4 --> 4700.32
the high rise to collapse in florida

4696.48 --> 4700.32
yeah i actually did see that

4704.4 --> 4707.839999999999
i think owen benjamin addressed this too

4706.719 --> 4711.52
i think it's

4707.84 --> 4713.84
very similar it's probably potentially

4711.52 --> 4717.4400000000005
what was involved with 911 too

4713.84 --> 4720.56
it could have been resonance weapon

4717.44 --> 4725.04
where they would literally

4720.56 --> 4729.04
disintegrate the material through

4725.04 --> 4732.64
very specific frequency attune to the

4729.04 --> 4735.76
critical infrastructure

4732.64 --> 4737.92
of the building if that part becomes

4735.76 --> 4742.320000000001
disintegrated

4737.92 --> 4744.32
more malleable or just turned to dust

4742.32 --> 4747.36
then yeah the whole thing can't carry

4744.32 --> 4750.4
its own weight anymore and it collapses

4747.36 --> 4752.4
so yeah you could liquefied soil

4750.4 --> 4756.239
underneath

4752.4 --> 4756.239
well yeah that's just more proof

4756.64 --> 4762.64
that might have not been look if

4759.84 --> 4763.92
see it like this is very likely the

4762.64 --> 4766.719
building was

4763.92 --> 4767.1990000000005
its infrastructure the building itself

4766.719 --> 4770.56
was

4767.199 --> 4773.919999999999
disintegrated in some way

4770.56 --> 4776.64
probably through resonance that could

4773.92 --> 4780.0
have liquefied soil as a side effect

4776.64 --> 4781.679
but if it was just liquefied soil

4780.0 --> 4783.199
then the building would never collapse

4781.679 --> 4786.4800000000005
like that

4783.199 --> 4789.678999999999
it would sink maybe topple

4786.48 --> 4791.678999999999
but not just break into pieces like that

4789.679 --> 4795.6
that would never happen just from

4791.679 --> 4795.6
liquefication of the soil alone

4798.32 --> 4802.5599999999995
explosive churches go well maybe maybe

4801.199 --> 4805.44
that was it

4802.56 --> 4807.360000000001
could be i didn't get a very extensive

4805.44 --> 4809.5199999999995
look

4807.36 --> 4810.719
it could be just controlled demolition

4809.52 --> 4814.320000000001
in a sneaky way

4810.719 --> 4819.12
it could be a resonance disintegration

4814.32 --> 4821.5199999999995
weapon that it's being subjected to

4819.12 --> 4821.5199999999995
i don't know

4822.239 --> 4826.32
it's definitely not a natural situation

4825.36 --> 4833.839999999999
happening

4826.32 --> 4833.84
no way

4844.84 --> 4847.84
so

4848.639 --> 4852.32
similar to wt7

4853.679 --> 4875.84
right yet trade center 7 was

4857.199 --> 4875.839999999999
definitely a control demolition

4886.84 --> 4889.84
so

4907.36 --> 4916.4
gonna lose value

4910.48 --> 4920.5599999999995
will they steamy traveler i don't know

4916.4 --> 4924.32
dude look you don't exactly know what

4920.56 --> 4928.159000000001
really happened and why this could be

4924.32 --> 4931.36
literally a local grabbler that just

4928.159 --> 4933.199
blew up the building for insurance money

4931.36 --> 4936.159
or something

4933.199 --> 4937.919999999999
and just nobody knew that was gonna you

4936.159 --> 4941.28
made it look like some freak

4937.92 --> 4942.32
accident or whatever he did you don't

4941.28 --> 4944.5599999999995
know

4942.32 --> 4946.08
until it all comes out who's actually

4944.56 --> 4950.320000000001
profiting

4946.08 --> 4953.92
so it might have just been a very grably

4950.32 --> 4956.5599999999995
sick plan to change

4953.92 --> 4958.719
the situation you know maybe there was

4956.56 --> 4960.8
somebody really wanting to buy up that

4958.719 --> 4961.28
building to demolish it and too many

4960.8 --> 4964.88
people

4961.28 --> 4966.8
in there just refused to go along

4964.88 --> 4968.4800000000005
and then he thought like oh [Â __Â ] you i'm

4966.8 --> 4972.2390000000005
just gonna blow it up

4968.48 --> 4974.239
totally arrogant and maniacal who knows

4972.239 --> 4976.159
dude there's all kinds of ways this

4974.239 --> 4980.0
could turn out to be

4976.159 --> 4987.839999999999
you don't know until the data comes out

4980.0 --> 4987.84
until leads present themselves

4998.84 --> 5001.84
so

5011.89 --> 5014.959000000001
[Music]

5017.12 --> 5020.239
faking the whole thing why i don't see

5019.44 --> 5023.36
how it's

5020.239 --> 5026.48
faked good servant because in that video

5023.36 --> 5028.639
the building definitely blew up

5026.48 --> 5030.959999999999
it wasn't there anymore that that's not

5028.639 --> 5030.96
fake

5032.32 --> 5043.84
now the context of the whole thing

5034.32 --> 5043.84
that's another matter

5046.08 --> 5052.159
no definitely not an engineer error it's

5049.28 --> 5054.5599999999995
definitely nefarious there's no freaking

5052.159 --> 5056.799999999999
way that an error could lead

5054.56 --> 5058.400000000001
to the utter destruction of a building

5056.8 --> 5062.56
like that

5058.4 --> 5064.879999999999
no way in hell

5062.56 --> 5067.04
it's absolutely nefarious one way or the

5064.88 --> 5067.84
other there were supposedly people in

5067.04 --> 5071.36
that building

5067.84 --> 5071.92
as it blew up right now is that actually

5071.36 --> 5075.599999999999
true

5071.92 --> 5076.159
i don't know i'm not saying it's not

5075.6 --> 5077.84
true

5076.159 --> 5081.199
i'm just saying i don't have any

5077.84 --> 5084.719
confirmation that that is true

5081.199 --> 5086.0
right but yeah you can't blow up a

5084.719 --> 5089.28
building like that

5086.0 --> 5092.639
by accident okay

5089.28 --> 5099.84
that is a certainty innocent air

5092.639 --> 5099.84
no good servant

5100.239 --> 5103.599999999999
failing building no

5110.239 --> 5114.239
look unless that building was already

5113.76 --> 5117.4400000000005
known

5114.239 --> 5120.718999999999
to have serious construction errors

5117.44 --> 5122.719
like really serious like who knows the

5120.719 --> 5124.96
materials they used for it were

5122.719 --> 5126.719
turned out to be really terrible and

5124.96 --> 5127.52
brittle or something you know maybe the

5126.719 --> 5130.719
steel

5127.52 --> 5132.88
frame was super brittle

5130.719 --> 5135.84
if that's the case then that would have

5132.88 --> 5135.84
been known

5136.48 --> 5139.599999999999
inescapable there would have been

5138.08 --> 5142.0
reports like wait there

5139.6 --> 5144.2390000000005
seem to be issues with the steel beams

5142.0 --> 5146.32
here they seem to be fracturing or

5144.239 --> 5148.239
bending is something wrong there would

5146.32 --> 5154.4
have been reports about that

5148.239 --> 5157.36
way before right evidence

5154.4 --> 5157.36
just evidence

5157.52 --> 5159.92
anyway

5161.04 --> 5167.84
it's sarcasm okay okay good sir that

5164.239 --> 5170.5599999999995
don't don't do that sarcasm is not for

5167.84 --> 5170.56
you my friend

5173.199 --> 5176.638999999999
like if you do sarcasm is a good servant

5175.679 --> 5179.92
you really

5176.639 --> 5184.719
gotta emphasize that you are because it

5179.92 --> 5184.719
becomes really confusing to me

5193.84 --> 5199.679
but that's maybe because i'm not just

5195.36 --> 5199.679
not expecting sarcasm from you at all

5208.84 --> 5211.84
anyway

5223.44 --> 5239.839999999999
come on good job you could do better

5226.0 --> 5239.84
than that

5245.28 --> 5250.159
it is kind of weird you know thinking

5247.84 --> 5252.4800000000005
about it

5250.159 --> 5254.159
with the airplanes hitting the world

5252.48 --> 5257.759999999999
trade center

5254.159 --> 5260.879999999999
like that's a big plane

5257.76 --> 5263.1990000000005
plane has an infrastructure thing

5260.88 --> 5264.32
right it has a structure it has wings in

5263.199 --> 5268.4
it

5264.32 --> 5268.4
so yeah it blew up right

5268.8 --> 5278.08
why didn't the frame of the plane

5273.36 --> 5281.679
keep sticking out of the building

5278.08 --> 5284.8
why was there nothing sticking out of it

5281.679 --> 5288.4
it's an entire plane flew in that thing

5284.8 --> 5289.84
why wasn't the tail sticking out in the

5288.4 --> 5293.28
back

5289.84 --> 5296.639
or like parts of the wing hanging over

5293.28 --> 5296.639
with an engine that like

5304.08 --> 5308.639
i think i really overlooked that one for

5306.56 --> 5312.88
a long time that's

5308.639 --> 5317.4400000000005
when first like the idea of cgi plays

5312.88 --> 5317.4400000000005
like well maybe maybe

5319.36 --> 5323.5199999999995
i'm not sure it's really confusing but

5322.239 --> 5327.28
yeah to think about

5323.52 --> 5328.8
okay if a big airplane actually hits a

5327.28 --> 5331.199
building

5328.8 --> 5334.0
it has a structure that thing is not

5331.199 --> 5337.919999999999
just gonna disintegrate evaporate

5334.0 --> 5339.36
into pure air even if there's a big

5337.92 --> 5341.679
fiery explosion

5339.36 --> 5343.28
from fuel or whatever like there's gonna

5341.679 --> 5346.8
be parts of the plane

5343.28 --> 5349.36
sticking out there isn't any of that

5346.8 --> 5351.6
there's no footage of that you just see

5349.36 --> 5352.88
a burning hole in the building with a

5351.6 --> 5356.159000000001
lot of smoke

5352.88 --> 5356.159000000001
nothing is sticking out

5356.8 --> 5361.04
no airplane wing is hanging

5362.84 --> 5368.0
right it's weird

5368.4 --> 5372.239
so maybe maybe there was no plane i

5370.719 --> 5375.04
don't know

5372.239 --> 5375.599999999999
if there were then there would be debris

5375.04 --> 5379.5199999999995
of it

5375.6 --> 5381.04
visibly there at least the tail of the

5379.52 --> 5393.84
plane would be sticking out of the

5381.04 --> 5393.84
building and you don't see any of that

5400.4 --> 5404.0
well old horse reborn

5405.04 --> 5411.6
i i disagree i think that

5409.28 --> 5412.5599999999995
for what they had available at the time

5411.6 --> 5415.52
20 years ago

5412.56 --> 5417.6
i think that they did a absolutely

5415.52 --> 5419.84
amazing job

5417.6 --> 5422.320000000001
in convincing everybody that planes

5419.84 --> 5426.96
actually hit that thing

5422.32 --> 5430.719
it was spectacular

5426.96 --> 5432.4800000000005
right now we're all being said bombarded

5430.719 --> 5435.36
with lots of advanced cgi

5432.48 --> 5437.5199999999995
and we become trained against it it

5435.36 --> 5439.679
wasn't there yet

5437.52 --> 5440.639
it was still in the roots of all that

5439.679 --> 5443.84
development

5440.639 --> 5448.400000000001
right cgi hadn't really perfected yet

5443.84 --> 5452.400000000001
so it was really well crafted

5448.4 --> 5452.4
if no planes actually hit it

5459.76 --> 5465.4400000000005
they say the plane went right through

5462.48 --> 5465.44
the steel building

5465.679 --> 5468.88
what you saying that it came out on the

5468.239 --> 5470.718999999999
other end

5468.88 --> 5471.92
i didn't see it where's the plane

5470.719 --> 5474.639
skeleton then

5471.92 --> 5476.4800000000005
coming out on the other end no even in

5474.639 --> 5478.159000000001
the footage you see it go in like you

5476.48 --> 5480.879999999999
see the building

5478.159 --> 5480.879999999999
and then it's like

5482.239 --> 5491.678999999999
it goes in there and then

5486.32 --> 5493.84
nothing then it's just smoke and fire

5491.679 --> 5495.679
and then it kind of lifts a little such

5493.84 --> 5504.32
just smoking and there is nothing

5495.679 --> 5508.8
sticking out

5504.32 --> 5508.799999999999
sort of no it was really well crafted

5509.04 --> 5519.84
i bought into it

5528.159 --> 5535.5199999999995
blew up through

5532.159 --> 5539.28
before it went to the other side

5535.52 --> 5539.280000000001
uh how

5544.32 --> 5547.84
why isn't there a tail sticking out

5585.679 --> 5588.88
right we all bought it because nobody

5588.239 --> 5594.48
was

5588.88 --> 5594.4800000000005
expecting to be tricked on this level

5594.719 --> 5598.8
nobody was expecting them to pull

5597.36 --> 5601.759999999999
something

5598.8 --> 5603.28
like that like blowing things up sure

5601.76 --> 5608.400000000001
whatever

5603.28 --> 5612.0
but to actually show cgi footage

5608.4 --> 5612.0
of a terrestrial event

5612.08 --> 5616.08
nobody was expecting that and that's how

5614.4 --> 5616.48
i'm pretty sure they got away with it

5616.08 --> 5620.4
because

5616.48 --> 5622.159
nobody was expecting something like that

5620.4 --> 5623.599999999999
they were expecting something not

5622.159 --> 5631.839999999999
something like that not

5623.6 --> 5631.84
that added on element

5642.84 --> 5645.84
so

5650.8 --> 5656.400000000001
yes seeking star wars well it has kind

5654.08 --> 5659.5199999999995
of been addressed though because

5656.4 --> 5662.32
there were jets in the air

5659.52 --> 5662.320000000001
at that time

5663.12 --> 5668.239
and if i remember it correctly was it

5668.56 --> 5675.84
dick cheney basically

5672.32 --> 5676.639
was in the command seat and he told them

5675.84 --> 5680.08
to stand

5676.639 --> 5683.36
down i remember that from like

5680.08 --> 5686.159
early 911 truth movies so

5683.36 --> 5686.88
yes it was well known early on that

5686.159 --> 5689.36
there were

5686.88 --> 5690.96
air airplanes in the sky and it was

5689.36 --> 5701.839999999999
suggested like they were ordered to

5690.96 --> 5701.84
stand down

5716.56 --> 5730.400000000001
yeah you're sent for that's right

5728.48 --> 5733.119
all right and they removed all the

5730.4 --> 5735.759999999999
building wreckage

5733.119 --> 5737.599999999999
like they quickly snatched it out of

5735.76 --> 5740.159000000001
there and kept it all a secret

5737.6 --> 5743.84
nobody was allowed to study the wreckage

5740.159 --> 5743.839999999999
remember that part

5744.88 --> 5748.8
i don't think they ever released it

5749.76 --> 5757.84

5753.119 --> 5757.839999999999
all in some warehouse somewhere

5758.56 --> 5762.080000000001

5766.8 --> 5770.88
is maybe it's all destroyed i don't know

5768.96 --> 5772.56
what they did but i remember that it was

5770.88 --> 5773.76
like oh yeah this company is quickly

5772.56 --> 5775.76

5818.56 --> 5822.0
all right i think i'm going to round out

5820.0 --> 5826.56
the show guys i've been

5822.0 --> 5829.52
going extra for 36 minutes

5826.56 --> 5830.080000000001

5830.08 --> 5834.0
yeah bringing that up again

5834.239 --> 5840.48
it's like 911 is really weird

5837.44 --> 5843.44
so many layers

5840.48 --> 5846.159
thoughts on holographic technology no

5843.44 --> 5846.159
not right now

5847.679 --> 5853.92
but i do know it has advanced

5851.199 --> 5854.879999999999
they've been experimenting a lot with

5853.92 --> 5858.2390000000005
its development

5854.88 --> 5861.28
over the last 100 years

5858.239 --> 5863.119
so they got stuff in storage

5861.28 --> 5864.719
now whether they're all gonna use it is

5863.119 --> 5868.5599999999995
another matter but they have

5864.719 --> 5871.679
stuff they got the tricks

5868.56 --> 5874.88
ready for rollout

5871.679 --> 5876.8
if they find it some kind of to them

5874.88 --> 5880.4800000000005
productive way to apply it

5876.8 --> 5884.719
it's no guarantee that they will uh

5880.48 --> 5884.718999999999
