right so the weather today is

115.52 --> 119.03999999999999
significantly turned around

119.28 --> 122.56
it's very clouded

123.6 --> 128.119
and yeah it's been raining a lot

128.64 --> 133.2
almost the entire day so far so

133.84 --> 136.879
it's still

135.599 --> 139.879
still

136.879 --> 139.879
warm

142.64 --> 150.0
yeah but it's definitely not as hot as

145.52 --> 153.0
the last as it's been the last week so

150.0 --> 153.0
right

160.48 --> 162.79999999999998
yeah

163.28 --> 165.68
right

168.64 --> 174.749
let's see here

169.6 --> 174.749
[Music]

174.959 --> 180.56
yeah it's 18 degrees celsius so

178.879 --> 183.04
it's still kind of nice

180.56 --> 186.4
but yeah it's just raining a lot of the

183.04 --> 186.4
time went through the

187.28 --> 191.76
through the rain

188.56 --> 191.76
even getting groceries

196.72 --> 199.68
but yeah

197.76 --> 201.84
inside being all dried up it's still

199.68 --> 204.87900000000002
warm enough to just sit here in t-shirt

201.84 --> 207.12
and and short so

204.879 --> 209.51899999999998
all right

207.12 --> 215.08
anyhow

209.519 --> 215.08
it's thursday the 7th of july 2022

232.159 --> 236.519
yeah flat earth debate was great

242.319 --> 248.159
it was like an hour after show roughly

245.28 --> 251.04
and yeah it was pretty good show

248.159 --> 251.04
lots of people

251.76 --> 257.28
from discord also like there's more flat

254.239 --> 260.4
earthers from discord joining these days

257.28 --> 260.4
it's kind of interesting

260.56 --> 264.32
uh

262.0 --> 268.84
jim bob also had a

264.32 --> 268.84
very entertaining stream again

269.199 --> 274.8
then got brenda on i think

273.28 --> 276.479
or at least she was hanging the chat

274.8 --> 278.88
might have actually joined for a bit i

276.479 --> 282.639
don't remember

278.88 --> 285.04
no wait yeah she did join and like even

282.639 --> 287.68
jim bob like got sick of her after a

285.04 --> 292.0
certain point and so yeah

287.68 --> 292.0
apparently even jim bob has his limits

295.04 --> 298.24
when it comes to patience

299.199 --> 305.08000000000004
uh hi tonoid first in chat good to see

302.08 --> 305.08
you

340.96 --> 344.15999999999997
so where is everybody

344.639 --> 349.639
i know it was an hour late yesterday but

358.4 --> 362.4
i didn't even go to bed like really that

360.319 --> 363.68
late i've been actually going to bed

362.4 --> 367.79999999999995
pretty early

363.68 --> 367.8
in like the last three days

368.0 --> 372.28
and that's been good for me

387.12 --> 391.68
so

389.039 --> 394.479
i don't have any particular subjects at

391.68 --> 397.199
hand other than just like oh everything

394.479 --> 398.96
that's going on already oh yeah well

397.199 --> 401.039
wait of course there's something new

398.96 --> 403.59999999999997
that happened it's just that

401.039 --> 406.479
it's probably going to be

403.6 --> 408.08000000000004
said everywhere so

406.479 --> 410.96
then i have a tendency to just not

408.08 --> 414.56
address it but i'll do it anyway so yeah

410.96 --> 417.19899999999996
georgie guidestones got blown up

414.56 --> 418.639
spooky mystery

417.199 --> 423.84000000000003
for some reason

418.639 --> 423.84000000000003
it wasn't revealed basically who did it

424.639 --> 429.919
so i got a weird suspicion about it

428.24 --> 430.88
mainly that

429.919 --> 434.0
the

430.88 --> 434.0
the owner did it

435.039 --> 439.68
maybe he's maybe it's literally the

436.96 --> 441.919
people that were kind of doing that

439.68 --> 444.16
realizing like yes it's not going to

441.919 --> 444.15999999999997
work

445.28 --> 451.11999999999995
that's the feeling that i got about it

448.56 --> 453.68
right also the why it it got removed

451.12 --> 456.4
it's like he wanted to remove it but

453.68 --> 458.479
he couldn't like just remove it so he

456.4 --> 461.12
probably

458.479 --> 463.36
did a false flag on his own monument

461.12 --> 465.12
maybe he did it for insurances purposes

463.36 --> 467.36
i don't know man i don't know very

465.12 --> 470.96
little about it's just

467.36 --> 470.96000000000004
it didn't seem like it was a

471.039 --> 475.28
an outsider that did that

476.0 --> 481.36
all right i'll leave you guys to figure

478.56 --> 482.319
it out for yourselves

481.36 --> 485.039
uh

482.319 --> 487.91900000000004
hello aries 106. yeah cern apparently

485.039 --> 487.919
fired up who

488.8 --> 491.8
evie

501.199 --> 506.72
decided to destroy no terror dude it was

504.319 --> 509.36
torn down it's it's already torn down

506.72 --> 509.36
didn't you know

510.24 --> 514.64
like bulldozers came in

512.88 --> 519.64
and like

514.64 --> 519.64
tore it down within a matter of hours

525.76 --> 529.68
maybe they don't need it anymore wheels

527.76 --> 531.04
are in motion no that doesn't make any

529.68 --> 535.3599999999999
sense

531.04 --> 537.4399999999999
then they would leave it

535.36 --> 540.6800000000001
yeah it's all gone they bulldozed the

537.44 --> 540.6800000000001
whole thing

568.48 --> 572.08
i'll try to find like a

574.16 --> 577.16
video

588.24 --> 591.839
right here it is

608.99 --> 612.74
[Music]

613.279 --> 617.24
so i guess that happened

621.44 --> 628.0
well because of the way things unrolled

624.32 --> 630.8000000000001
i just have a suspicion that it was a uh

628.0 --> 633.519
a false flag control demolition thing

630.8 --> 635.92
actually

633.519 --> 639.04
and i don't know like what's is there

635.92 --> 640.8
any insurance situation tied into it

639.04 --> 643.36
because that might be

640.8 --> 643.3599999999999
the reason

644.0 --> 647.64
is it a good thing

650.0 --> 652.399
maybe

656.88 --> 662.32
probably not as good as everybody would

658.959 --> 664.079
like to believe it is but

662.32 --> 668.0
i mean it was kind of ridiculous it was

664.079 --> 668.0
there in the first place for decades

669.76 --> 672.76
right

682.11 --> 689.799
[Music]

690.88 --> 696.079
maybe they just wanted to install well

693.44 --> 698.8000000000001
yeah maybe they they are

696.079 --> 701.959
who knows ares 106

698.8 --> 701.959
who knows

727.12 --> 733.839
didn't it get roomed with spray paint

730.56 --> 733.8389999999999
no not really

736.72 --> 742.0790000000001
i mean it's not that difficult to just

738.72 --> 742.0790000000001
clean that all off again

742.8 --> 749.68
and the footage even that is shown

746.639 --> 750.639
of the explosion in the night and it

749.68 --> 752.399
being

750.639 --> 756.0790000000001
broken down it doesn't look like it has

752.399 --> 757.519
any spray paint out on it at all so

756.079 --> 761.0
whenever that happened they already

757.519 --> 761.0
cleaned that up

808.72 --> 813.1600000000001
hey pgcnet good to see you

816.8 --> 822.959
well pg look i don't even think it's a

819.199 --> 825.199
false flag to like engage in enemy

822.959 --> 827.5189999999999
i think it was a false flag probably as

825.199 --> 829.76
some kind of an insurance

827.519 --> 832.0
claim thing like he wanted to tear it

829.76 --> 833.519
down but

832.0 --> 834.959
you know

833.519 --> 837.6
if he could just fake that it was

834.959 --> 839.68
attacked maybe he was insured for that

837.6 --> 841.6
maybe like the insurance company was

839.68 --> 844.56
like yeah whatever

841.6 --> 844.5600000000001
sure why not

845.12 --> 849.199
who knows man i don't know how this all

847.199 --> 850.7199999999999
works exactly

849.199 --> 852.3199999999999
i just know that even with the world

850.72 --> 853.32
trade center

852.32 --> 855.12
there was

853.32 --> 856.72
significant

855.12 --> 858.8
insurance

856.72 --> 860.639
involved

858.8 --> 863.5999999999999
right it's usually when there's like a

860.639 --> 865.519
serious false flag of any level

863.6 --> 869.0790000000001
there's always some kind of insurance

865.519 --> 869.079
stuff going on

881.44 --> 885.2790000000001
but maybe they will maybe they will use

883.36 --> 888.48
it

885.279 --> 890.079
maybe they could use it later

888.48 --> 891.6800000000001
you know you don't really know but it

890.079 --> 895.5999999999999
doesn't look like

891.68 --> 898.399
like if it would have been like oh look

895.6 --> 900.32
we're gonna false flag this to accuse a

898.399 --> 903.6
group and attack then they would have

900.32 --> 906.1600000000001
like unrolled that very quickly

903.6 --> 908.24
right they never let grass grow over

906.16 --> 910.3199999999999
that sort of [ __ ] they just like

908.24 --> 911.279
they almost announced on the news who

910.32 --> 912.48
did it

911.279 --> 915.76
before

912.48 --> 915.76
they even got the data

917.279 --> 919.519
right

920.88 --> 923.76
so

921.76 --> 925.4399999999999
it doesn't seem like it's a false flag

923.76 --> 930.079
of the type that is being that's going

925.44 --> 932.0790000000001
to be directly used to hype up an enemy

930.079 --> 936.3199999999999
so

932.079 --> 936.3199999999999
i think it's more just insurance related

936.48 --> 940.44
but i don't know

941.04 --> 945.04
at this point it's just guess work

950.24 --> 956.5600000000001
get rid of any evidence

954.399 --> 959.36
yeah yeah they did clean it up very

956.56 --> 962.0
quickly didn't they just like with the

959.36 --> 964.8000000000001
world trade center huh

962.0 --> 967.519
yeah the similarities are

964.8 --> 970.68
yeah strike a little bit

967.519 --> 970.68
at least

974.56 --> 978.1899999999999
[Music]

982.29 --> 985.5999999999999
[Music]

1018.32 --> 1022.0790000000001
to clean up what do you mean derrick

1020.24 --> 1024.959
they removed it all

1022.079 --> 1026.8799999999999
so

1024.959 --> 1029.199
there's not a lot of footage of like

1026.88 --> 1029.199
even

1029.36 --> 1032.8799999999999
like evidence of what really happened

1032.0 --> 1034.88
like

1032.88 --> 1036.48
yeah there's this footage of it blowing

1034.88 --> 1040.0790000000002
up but

1036.48 --> 1044.24
like how is that blowing up

1040.079 --> 1044.24
you don't see like an explosive

1044.559 --> 1050.84
or any other like what was that

1048.0 --> 1055.36
right well they cleaned it all up so

1050.84 --> 1055.36
now probably never gonna find out

1058.64 --> 1063.8400000000001
dude maybe they just use their new

1060.96 --> 1067.32
high-tech laser weapon system

1063.84 --> 1067.32
on that thing

1067.44 --> 1070.76
like secretly

1082.12 --> 1085.84
conveniently edited

1086.72 --> 1092.6000000000001
what do you mean what does that mean

1089.36 --> 1095.6999999999998
dj dj

1092.6 --> 1095.6999999999998
[Music]

1103.84 --> 1108.039
hello by the way del west watson

1111.52 --> 1124.8799999999999
[Music]

1125.44 --> 1131.2
oh right yes yes they

1128.0 --> 1132.4
only showed the explanation explosion

1131.2 --> 1138.24
but yeah

1132.4 --> 1138.24
if it were sneaky perpetrators doing it

1138.88 --> 1142.48
then why did they cut that out right

1141.6 --> 1145.52
yeah

1142.48 --> 1147.679
that's extremely suspicious

1145.52 --> 1150.679
that they didn't even show any figure

1147.679 --> 1150.679
there

1152.16 --> 1156.96
silver car oh i didn't even see that one

1157.84 --> 1162.28
keep an eye out for that next time

1166.799 --> 1170.0
what

1167.679 --> 1174.16
do we know what was in the time cap what

1170.0 --> 1174.16
are you talking about what time capsule

1174.72 --> 1178.52
hey seeking star wars

1184.72 --> 1189.6000000000001
yes mike sudanich that's what you get

1187.44 --> 1191.28
when you walk away from the early bird

1189.6 --> 1193.039
show

1191.28 --> 1196.08
now you don't have any clue what the

1193.039 --> 1196.08
hell i was talking about

1199.2 --> 1204.0800000000002
there was a capsule under it question

1201.6 --> 1205.039
mark i don't know was there a capsule

1204.08 --> 1209.3999999999999
under it

1205.039 --> 1209.4
first time i'm hearing about that

1217.71 --> 1222.4
[Music]

1220.96 --> 1226.4
okay

1222.4 --> 1226.4
well where did you hear that from

1228.08 --> 1232.9399999999998
is that just rumors

1229.72 --> 1232.94
[Music]

1233.28 --> 1237.84
it's very popular target for rumors or

1236.24 --> 1241.039
did you actually get it off some

1237.84 --> 1241.039
official thing

1246.88 --> 1252.2800000000002
facebook oh right

1249.28 --> 1252.28
yeah

1285.12 --> 1290.08
no that was it's the first time ever

1287.44 --> 1292.24
that i'm hearing about that

1290.08 --> 1292.24
so

1293.2 --> 1298.159
like besides why it's a very weird thing

1295.76 --> 1298.1589999999999
to do

1298.4 --> 1303.96
why would you bury that beneath a stone

1300.96 --> 1303.96
structure

1304.72 --> 1307.72
right

1370.96 --> 1375.28
so yeah i'm a little under the weather

1373.2 --> 1377.039
today well not sick or anything it's

1375.28 --> 1379.52
just a

1377.039 --> 1379.52
slow

1380.64 --> 1384.24
maybe like finally

1385.6 --> 1391.6789999999999
been going high energy for a while so i

1388.96 --> 1391.679
needed a break

1392.88 --> 1396.6000000000001
did cool down

1404.32 --> 1408.0
i had a good interaction with my healer

1406.48 --> 1410.96
again as well

1408.0 --> 1411.84
over the phone this morning

1410.96 --> 1413.1200000000001
it's like

1411.84 --> 1415.9189999999999
just

1413.12 --> 1419.1999999999998
like we stock talk like spirit strategy

1415.919 --> 1421.2
so like from all sides it's

1419.2 --> 1422.96
quite a bizarre

1421.2 --> 1425.039
if you would just listen in on the

1422.96 --> 1427.279
outside as to what is being said from

1425.039 --> 1428.4
both sides is you'd be like how is

1427.279 --> 1429.36
almost like

1428.4 --> 1431.52
what

1429.36 --> 1433.279
what are they talking about

1431.52 --> 1435.52
but like when we're talking it's like

1433.279 --> 1437.36
almost telepathy so

1435.52 --> 1439.6
and a lot of puzzling

1437.36 --> 1443.039
sometimes i don't even hear all what all

1439.6 --> 1443.039
his words coming through the phone

1443.44 --> 1446.96
but uh

1445.679 --> 1449.8400000000001
yeah

1446.96 --> 1451.76
certainty is that

1449.84 --> 1453.76
a lot of things are set being set in

1451.76 --> 1456.0
motion right now

1453.76 --> 1457.36
especially for the netherlands that

1456.0 --> 1459.84
could get

1457.36 --> 1459.84
quite heavy

1461.679 --> 1466.64
so i got some like

1463.44 --> 1468.72
tinker taylor warnings about that about

1466.64 --> 1472.0
how i should conduct myself in the face

1468.72 --> 1475.52
of what's about to happen

1472.0 --> 1475.52
i'm going to keep that to myself

1478.159 --> 1482.159
at least

1479.44 --> 1485.039
the basics of it is just don't

1482.159 --> 1487.44
get too caught up in

1485.039 --> 1490.32
like fear of the darkness of like how

1487.44 --> 1490.3200000000002
far they're gonna go

1491.76 --> 1495.039
that's pretty much it for me

1498.84 --> 1504.08
anyhow do i think flat earther numbers

1502.24 --> 1506.4
have increased massively in the last

1504.08 --> 1506.3999999999999
year

1506.48 --> 1508.72
no

1510.08 --> 1513.12
not really

1512.24 --> 1516.159
just

1513.12 --> 1516.1589999999999
a steady growth

1521.679 --> 1524.5590000000002
like

1522.559 --> 1527.6789999999999
in this age

1524.559 --> 1529.2
it's a lot easier to bump into flatter

1527.679 --> 1531.679
and actually

1529.2 --> 1533.279
grab hold of it try to figure it out

1531.679 --> 1536.0
then it was

1533.279 --> 1537.52
10 years ago

1536.0 --> 1539.12
like a lot

1537.52 --> 1540.799
easier now

1539.12 --> 1543.84
but it doesn't mean that people will

1540.799 --> 1543.84
actually just do that

1544.08 --> 1546.6399999999999
right

1544.63 --> 1548.72
[Music]

1546.64 --> 1552.24
but yeah the amount of psychological

1548.72 --> 1554.24
warfare and overt lies

1552.24 --> 1557.52
that have come out of the corporations

1554.24 --> 1560.159
and government conspirators

1557.52 --> 1563.6
yeah that's going to make flat earth

1560.159 --> 1563.6000000000001
look a lot more reasonable

1564.96 --> 1569.3600000000001
so

1566.559 --> 1572.6399999999999
like the high tension

1569.36 --> 1572.6399999999999
is gonna go off it

1573.52 --> 1579.279
with the the average normal

1576.4 --> 1581.919
minded person right i mean the

1579.279 --> 1584.159
the gammas and the crazies like they're

1581.919 --> 1586.159
still gonna hate it as much as much as

1584.159 --> 1588.24
ever maybe even more

1586.159 --> 1590.72
that's more it has to do with their own

1588.24 --> 1593.44
tension and their own inability to deal

1590.72 --> 1595.3600000000001
and grasp hold on to everything that's

1593.44 --> 1597.1200000000001
happening right now

1595.36 --> 1599.52
rather than us

1597.12 --> 1601.12
and i think the average public

1599.52 --> 1603.12
over like the last

1601.12 --> 1605.1999999999998
seven years has grown

1603.12 --> 1608.0
much more accustomed to like oh yeah

1605.2 --> 1610.159
flat earthers okay

1608.0 --> 1612.08
whether they're interested or think they

1610.159 --> 1615.0390000000002
have a point

1612.08 --> 1615.039
that's another matter

1616.24 --> 1620.08
but it's

1617.44 --> 1623.76
yeah our numbers are you could say

1620.08 --> 1626.76
growing steadily but not rapidly and

1623.76 --> 1626.76
yeah

1632.64 --> 1637.76
okay

1634.96 --> 1640.48
you sense a huge influx of flat earthers

1637.76 --> 1640.48
in india

1641.279 --> 1644.0
interesting

1646.96 --> 1651.2
well i mean india

1648.64 --> 1655.1200000000001
more than most regions has a good reason

1651.2 --> 1659.44
to basically hold on to flat earth

1655.12 --> 1659.4399999999998
i mean the hindu cosmology is just

1659.52 --> 1663.2
has more elements and

1661.52 --> 1664.799
traits

1663.2 --> 1666.24
of it

1664.799 --> 1668.6399999999999
hints at it

1666.24 --> 1670.08
than most other religious works in

1668.64 --> 1671.5200000000002
history

1670.08 --> 1673.84
so

1671.52 --> 1676.559
and it's been kind of buried under this

1673.84 --> 1678.799
oh look we have our own nasa now we're

1676.559 --> 1682.48
building spaceships and satellites and

1678.799 --> 1684.32
all the fantastical futuristic age but

1682.48 --> 1687.279
yeah that doesn't mean that those roots

1684.32 --> 1687.279
aren't still there

1687.52 --> 1691.679
so as soon just like the rest of the

1689.679 --> 1694.48
world when the government's authority

1691.679 --> 1696.96
falters and the delusions snap

1694.48 --> 1698.88
people are gonna try to find the roots

1696.96 --> 1701.279
again and for india yeah that's gonna be

1698.88 --> 1705.279
flat earthers too

1701.279 --> 1705.279
so yeah you might be right there territ

1705.84 --> 1709.36
if it goes big here it goes yeah

1708.559 --> 1711.2
that's

1709.36 --> 1713.76
that's just because the amount of

1711.2 --> 1713.76
indians

1714.0 --> 1716.48
indeed

1722.84 --> 1727.6
oh

1724.48 --> 1730.64
oh that's great that's that is great

1727.6 --> 1730.6399999999999
tara 306.

1731.2 --> 1734.799
i'm very glad for you

1733.679 --> 1739.5590000000002
yeah

1734.799 --> 1739.559
we'll see let's see how this unrolls

1742.71 --> 1747.029
[Music]

1751.12 --> 1755.6789999999999
can i ask a question

1752.88 --> 1759.919
what kind of a full-blown flat earther

1755.679 --> 1762.64
is that hindu religious leader

1759.919 --> 1765.279
is he a disker

1762.64 --> 1767.44
or like does he keep it vague and just

1765.279 --> 1769.279
like it is flat it's not planets in

1767.44 --> 1771.679
outer space

1769.279 --> 1774.399
is he like an old-fashioned

1771.679 --> 1774.3990000000001
turtle guy

1774.96 --> 1779.279
like

1776.399 --> 1781.12
or haven't you even like looked into

1779.279 --> 1783.44
his talks and all that too deeply i

1781.12 --> 1783.4399999999998
don't know

1783.76 --> 1787.32
do you know terror306

1795.039 --> 1800.8799999999999
yeah that's right pjc net exactly

1797.6 --> 1803.36
yeah leaders aren't

1800.88 --> 1805.679
as reliable as everybody had hoped and

1803.36 --> 1807.6789999999999
then they yeah flat earth just doesn't

1805.679 --> 1809.8400000000001
look as bad anymore in the face of all

1807.679 --> 1809.8400000000001
that

1821.44 --> 1825.919
okay

1823.36 --> 1827.84
all right so

1825.919 --> 1829.919
that doesn't technically make him a

1827.84 --> 1833.12
full-blown flat earther then though

1829.919 --> 1835.8400000000001
terra 306 it just makes him a

1833.12 --> 1837.84
globe cosmology

1835.84 --> 1840.8799999999999
which is great by the way it's very

1837.84 --> 1844.559
sensible thing to do especially

1840.88 --> 1844.5590000000002
in like the last century

1845.2 --> 1850.3990000000001
right when it was still a lot of taboo

1848.32 --> 1853.6
then really just criticism on the

1850.399 --> 1855.84
cosmology in that criticism

1853.6 --> 1858.559
would be much safer than actually saying

1855.84 --> 1860.9599999999998
no it's flat and

1858.559 --> 1864.279
what you think it is

1860.96 --> 1864.279
so yeah

1885.36 --> 1890.79
yeah all right

1887.59 --> 1890.79
[Music]

1944.399 --> 1947.399
correct

1960.32 --> 1963.72
oh sorry

1993.039 --> 1996.039
hmm

2015.44 --> 2021.0800000000002
hdmi traveler

2017.12 --> 2021.08
and yeah good question

2021.65 --> 2028.18
[Music]

2071.65 --> 2079.399
[Music]

2082.77 --> 2085.86
[Music]

2088.56 --> 2093.679
jesus christ

2090.56 --> 2093.679
how do you guys do that

2100.4 --> 2103.4
bianca

2115.76 --> 2119.3590000000004
did i pronounce that correctly

2127.52 --> 2131.7599999999998
like indian math powerland that's

2129.92 --> 2133.76
hilarious

2131.76 --> 2136.76
i think he's a little older than that

2133.76 --> 2136.76
probably

2168.32 --> 2171.32
hmm

2180.0 --> 2182.24
okay

2185.68 --> 2188.72
why yes

2188.8 --> 2194.6400000000003
all right

2190.72 --> 2196.48
so it's shankara charya

2194.64 --> 2199.48
govardhan

2196.48 --> 2199.48
puri

2212.24 --> 2215.24
powerland

2217.2 --> 2220.48
uh

2218.64 --> 2222.24
that's hilarious dominoi thank you for

2220.48 --> 2224.079
that

2222.24 --> 2227.0789999999997
well i pronounce it right

2224.079 --> 2227.079
cool

2232.16 --> 2236.3199999999997
that's the thing with me like i don't

2234.4 --> 2237.839
necessarily have to understand the

2236.32 --> 2240.4
language

2237.839 --> 2244.24
but i understand pronunciations i

2240.4 --> 2246.2400000000002
understand the flow of a language

2244.24 --> 2249.52
that's that's the part about language i

2246.24 --> 2249.52
understand very quickly

2251.2 --> 2256.3999999999996
it's by the way extremely useful ability

2254.88 --> 2257.76
when you're like

2256.4 --> 2261.119
method acting

2257.76 --> 2263.2000000000003
very very useful

2261.119 --> 2266.079
because it is like the spirit of a

2263.2 --> 2266.0789999999997
people in a way

2266.4 --> 2271.839
and if you get that then you kind of get

2268.88 --> 2271.839
the spirit of the people

2272.64 --> 2276.0789999999997
i can learn a lot

2274.88 --> 2279.48
anyhow

2276.079 --> 2279.48
that was fun

2287.599 --> 2291.92
i guess yeah i'll google him let's see

2292.079 --> 2295.3590000000004
what he looks like at least

2296.8 --> 2300.6400000000003
oh yeah that's an old guy right now

2306.0 --> 2309.0
huh

2317.839 --> 2322.68
it's a very interesting looking man

2339.04 --> 2343.8
so many pictures of him when he was

2340.8 --> 2343.8
young

2355.359 --> 2359.7599999999998
wow he doesn't look all that much

2357.2 --> 2362.48
younger than those either

2359.76 --> 2364.8
how cool is it this guy must be like

2362.48 --> 2368.839
really freaking old

2364.8 --> 2368.8390000000004
still looks amazing though

2397.599 --> 2400.56
yeah tiny whitcomb

2406.24 --> 2413.04
a very opinionated guy oh that's well

2409.04 --> 2413.04
yeah that's not necessarily a bad thing

2415.52 --> 2421.599
yeah what tony witka

2418.0 --> 2425.44
um yeah so far i i'm in the suspicion

2421.599 --> 2427.04
that it is actually a false flag

2425.44 --> 2428.16
insurance

2427.04 --> 2429.92
job

2428.16 --> 2433.2
what actually happened

2429.92 --> 2433.2000000000003
something in that direction

2434.24 --> 2436.64
i mean

2437.52 --> 2441.68
the the footage they just didn't show

2440.88 --> 2445.92
how

2441.68 --> 2445.9199999999996
the explosive was placed who did it

2446.8 --> 2450.319
nobody nothing was revealed not even

2448.8 --> 2453.2000000000003
people in masks

2450.319 --> 2455.7599999999998
and they clean it up very quickly after

2453.2 --> 2457.4399999999996
like it's all torn down now like within

2455.76 --> 2460.2400000000002
hours they did they do it they did that

2457.44 --> 2462.7200000000003
they just bulldozed it very quickly

2460.24 --> 2464.0789999999997
and that just gives me the feeling just

2462.72 --> 2468.48
like

2464.079 --> 2468.48
that's probably an insurance job

2476.24 --> 2480.4799999999996
gives me the feeling i don't even know

2478.0 --> 2482.56
if it is in short i don't

2480.48 --> 2484.16
know how it all works exactly it's been

2482.56 --> 2486.72
pretty hidden

2484.16 --> 2489.1189999999997
even though it's been very

2486.72 --> 2491.2
widely known of course through the

2489.119 --> 2494.6800000000003
conspiracy

2491.2 --> 2494.68
social media

2496.079 --> 2501.28
but yeah it just the way it all happened

2499.119 --> 2504.7200000000003
makes me think that it is probably a

2501.28 --> 2506.2400000000002
false flag and the owner did it himself

2504.72 --> 2508.319
because he wanted to get rid of it

2506.24 --> 2509.359
anyway

2508.319 --> 2511.68
but

2509.359 --> 2513.7599999999998
yeah if you can get some money out of it

2511.68 --> 2516.48
then just like oh oh it was insured

2513.76 --> 2519.28
against terrorist attacks oh

2516.48 --> 2524.4
right just like the world trade center

2519.28 --> 2526.8
was insured against it like

2524.4 --> 2529.92
breaking apart and crashing down into

2526.8 --> 2531.8390000000004
rubble upon airplane hits right like oh

2529.92 --> 2533.92
yeah that seems ridiculous oh but that's

2531.839 --> 2536.24
exactly what happened yes that's why

2533.92 --> 2537.2000000000003
they got a huge amount of money out of

2536.24 --> 2539.1189999999997
it

2537.2 --> 2541.839
so that's just the first thing that i

2539.119 --> 2544.1600000000003
thought about when i saw

2541.839 --> 2546.4
well pretty much the moment that it was

2544.16 --> 2547.2
announced like oh they're bulldozing it

2546.4 --> 2548.8
now

2547.2 --> 2551.2799999999997
like what

2548.8 --> 2554.1600000000003
what without a giant news story on the

2551.28 --> 2556.5600000000004
news that some terrorists have done it

2554.16 --> 2557.5699999999997
okay

2556.56 --> 2560.629
um

2557.57 --> 2560.6290000000004
[Music]

2564.24 --> 2567.2

2567.359 --> 2572.04
lightning

2569.04 --> 2572.04
what

2588.24 --> 2590.56
what

2591.52 --> 2595.119
guy

2592.64 --> 2595.1189999999997
okay

2595.68 --> 2602.64
derpcon

2598.16 --> 2602.64
i don't know how high at least one

2604.079 --> 2609.079
there was no lightning strike visible

2606.079 --> 2609.079
there

2622.88 --> 2626.4
you need to demonize conspiracy type

2624.88 --> 2627.52
folks yeah but the clutch the whole

2626.4 --> 2631.52
point is

2627.52 --> 2631.52
they haven't done that

2633.28 --> 2637.8390000000004
they didn't so

2635.119 --> 2640.079
it seems like it was more an insurance

2637.839 --> 2640.0789999999997
job

2640.64 --> 2643.92
and the insurance company was like yeah

2643.2 --> 2645.7599999999998
just

2643.92 --> 2646.96
make it look like conspiracy theorists

2645.76 --> 2648.5600000000004
did it

2646.96 --> 2650.96
and then we'll play out

2648.56 --> 2653.2
right it could be that cheap it could be

2650.96 --> 2653.2
that

2654.16 --> 2658.7999999999997
it's like it's just business as usual

2657.28 --> 2661.119
for the elite

2658.8 --> 2661.119
right

2661.44 --> 2665.44
look at the video that video what video

2664.319 --> 2668.079
link

2665.44 --> 2671.079
what the one that i posted that video

2668.079 --> 2671.079

2696.56 --> 2699.599
silver sedan

2701.52 --> 2705.52
okay

2702.72 --> 2707.52
a car

2705.52 --> 2709.599
driving over the grass that is a bit

2707.52 --> 2711.7599999999998
weird

2709.599 --> 2715.56
right but but the who

2711.76 --> 2715.5600000000004
is that then

2722.4 --> 2726.48
where's the supposed lightning strike

2727.28 --> 2731.92
there's no lightning strike there's a

2729.44 --> 2735.52
lightning strike the entire screen would

2731.92 --> 2736.56
have been the just white for a second

2735.52 --> 2738.0
it's not

2736.56 --> 2741.319
like what the hell are you blabbering

2738.0 --> 2741.319
about dude

2764.88 --> 2769.28
i mean i'm pretty sure that zeus

2766.88 --> 2771.52
wouldn't be very happy about the georgia

2769.28 --> 2774.6400000000003
guidestones and hey if i were suicide

2771.52 --> 2777.7599999999998

2774.64 --> 2780.72
let's get super wonky conspiracy theory

2777.76 --> 2783.8390000000004
nutty talk now

2780.72 --> 2786.0789999999997
so they fired up the

2783.839 --> 2788.7999999999997
the hydrant collider it created a

2786.079 --> 2792.6400000000003
massive magnetic field that's basically

2788.8 --> 2794.96
like magnetics lightning electricity and

2792.64 --> 2797.2799999999997
maybe it opened up the gate for the gods

2794.96 --> 2799.599
and zeus was like okay

2797.28 --> 2799.599
hmm

2799.839 --> 2805.52
let's blow up that thing

2803.839 --> 2808.48

what do you call it

2824.64 --> 2830.0789999999997
the cast type stone this is not like a

2827.359 --> 2832.16
slab of granite that is sliced out of a

2830.079 --> 2832.96
mountain and that is unique

2832.16 --> 2835.7599999999998
right

2832.96 --> 2838.16
that's not this stuff is more like weird

2835.76 --> 2839.5200000000004
chalky looking it's like a sandstone or

2838.16 --> 2841.2799999999997
something

2839.52 --> 2845.68
i don't know what it is

2841.28 --> 2848.8
but it does not look like granite at all

2845.68 --> 2848.7999999999997
a composite yes

2849.92 --> 2858.839
it's a cast type stone this is not a

2853.68 --> 2858.839
slab of original mountain cut stone

2864.11 --> 2871.1600000000003
[Music]

2865.92 --> 2871.16
real good video hey stop shouting

2873.2 --> 2880.7999999999997

cement no no it doesn't look like cement

2887.92 --> 2890.92
though

2912.16 --> 2918.0789999999997
oh it's pronounced grano granite in us

2916.0 --> 2919.52

2918.079 --> 2922.0
granite

2919.52 --> 2926.48

2922.0 --> 2926.48
that is it's is it's granite

2926.72 --> 2929.72
it's

2944.16 --> 2949.2
i'm not like making effort to sound

2946.64 --> 2950.64
american or anything it's just that that

2949.2 --> 2953.04
is

2950.64 --> 2954.48
a lot of the default source information

2953.04 --> 2956.64
that i got

2954.48 --> 2958.64
when i was really enthusiastic to learn

2956.64 --> 2961.44
english

2958.64 --> 2963.359
but i'm kind of a blend

2961.44 --> 2966.4
between english

2963.359 --> 2966.4
and american so

2967.359 --> 2970.88
okay

2968.559 --> 2973.76
well the maybe it's just the dutch

2970.88 --> 2977.6400000000003
english pronunciation then

2973.76 --> 2977.6400000000003
i like to call it granite

2997.119 --> 3000.8
carved you think that's carved gadget

2999.52 --> 3003.2
inspector

3000.8 --> 3005.6800000000003

letters are carved

3005.68 --> 3011.04
no it's cast

3008.48 --> 3014.559
you don't carve that [ __ ]

3011.04 --> 3017.68
you cast it you take a mold

3014.559 --> 3019.0400000000004
and then you cast the stone in it it

3017.68 --> 3021.7599999999998
hardens

3019.04 --> 3024.319
bloop you got the entire thing with

3021.76 --> 3026.7200000000003
print and all

3024.319 --> 3029.92
it's not too difficult to figure out

3026.72 --> 3033.2799999999997
it's not carved it's not original stone

3029.92 --> 3037.04
it's not sculpted it's cast

3033.28 --> 3040.559
quick and easy dude they could literally

3037.04 --> 3042.5589999999997
recast the same thing and put up the

3040.559 --> 3045.28
entire monument again

3042.559 --> 3049.079
like in a week time and you wouldn't

3045.28 --> 3049.079
even see the difference

3074.8 --> 3079.8390000000004
actually real about it

3076.88 --> 3083.44

3079.839 --> 3085.92
it creates a magnetic field

3083.44 --> 3085.92
that's it

3095.44 --> 3099.68
yes steemit yes yes yes with real

3101.04 --> 3105.599
like use chisels to fine carve stuff

3103.92 --> 3108.16
with it because it yeah because that's

3105.599 --> 3108.1600000000003

because every time i hear like anybody

3222.0 --> 3227.52

it was a long long time ago as a little

3352.96 --> 3356.64
kid but all i remember is that he would

3355.28 --> 3357.52
like go

3356.64 --> 3360.16

3357.52 --> 3362.64

3363.88 --> 3368.319
atrocious accent like so

that

3387.04 --> 3393.92
concerns the entire country and we

3390.96 --> 3396.559
will make sure that we will work out

3393.92 --> 3399.52
whatever differences we have

3396.559 --> 3401.119
to ensure the best outcome for our both

3399.52 --> 3401.92
our parties

3401.119 --> 3405.2000000000003
right

3421.92 --> 3425.52
difficult

3423.119 --> 3427.6800000000003
i don't know how we could have done it

3425.52 --> 3430.839
how we could have been so terrible with

3427.68 --> 3432.5589999999997

3520.319 --> 3525.44
i also know there's like

3523.04 --> 3527.839
fake granite where they artificially

3525.44 --> 3529.599
make it somehow

3527.839 --> 3531.839
so there's all kinds of things they do

3529.599 --> 3531.839
now

3534.319 --> 3540.119
that's probably what you mean with

3536.48 --> 3540.119
composite granite

3544.88 --> 3548.559
but like real granite

3548.64 --> 3551.92
that

3550.0 --> 3553.68
you're not just going to blow that off

3551.92 --> 3556.319
real granite is

3553.68 --> 3558.8799999999997
well of course thing it's unbelievably

3556.319 --> 3561.119
hard

3558.88 --> 3563.92
and yeah that's

3561.119 --> 3565.04
it's like original it's it's like a

3563.92 --> 3567.2000000000003
gem it's

3565.04 --> 3569.119
exactly how it was carved from a

3567.2 --> 3571.52
mountain it's like a sin to just blow

3569.119 --> 3573.839
that up even

3571.52 --> 3573.839
right

3574.16 --> 3578.3999999999996
okay

3576.48 --> 3580.72
poured concrete as he

3578.4 --> 3583.119
got some added

3580.72 --> 3583.1189999999997
okay

3584.72 --> 3587.72
what

3593.04 --> 3596.24
yes

3594.079 --> 3599.88
that doesn't really sound like granite

3596.24 --> 3599.8799999999997
that's just like

3600.559 --> 3603.8390000000004
with just rocks in it

3608.079 --> 3610.48
i mean

3611.28 --> 3617.119
real granite is very specific

3615.119 --> 3619.28
what is in there is like three elements

3617.119 --> 3620.559
that really make it what it is

3619.28 --> 3622.0
and again

3620.559 --> 3623.92
you used to know it

3622.0 --> 3625.599
one of them is feldspar it's very

3623.92 --> 3629.839
important

3625.599 --> 3629.839
and ah i forgot what it was

3632.0 --> 3641.669
i can google it

3635.72 --> 3641.669

3643.2 --> 3646.2

3663.119 --> 3668.079
aluminium potassium what

3665.839 --> 3670.48
what the hell no

3668.079 --> 3672.7200000000003
uh

3670.48 --> 3675.04
this should be better it's an igneous

3672.72 --> 3675.04

3675.359 --> 3679.119
potassium feldspar

geoclassy

3681.839 --> 3686.319
quartz

3684.319 --> 3688.96
yeah it does that's important like the

3686.319 --> 3693.5589999999997
feldspar the quartz and then there is

3688.96 --> 3693.559
the other compo what's the other one

3698.92 --> 3703.92
muscovite biotite horn blend

3704.4 --> 3711.2000000000003
right that's like the rest

3707.359 --> 3712.72
but the quartz and the feldspar are like

3711.2 --> 3715.68
the thing that

3712.72 --> 3717.52
combined with the rest

3715.68 --> 3719.7599999999998
that is really what gives it like the

3717.52 --> 3721.7599999999998
granite unique ability and it's

3719.76 --> 3724.0
electrical

3721.76 --> 3726.96
there's like a weird electricity that

3724.0 --> 3729.839
just comes off it it's almost like

3726.96 --> 3729.839
radioactive

3733.92 --> 3738.799
but yeah and i remember that it was it

3735.68 --> 3743.1189999999997
was quartz feldspar and the other one

3738.799 --> 3743.119
and i forgot what the other one was

[Music]

3748.0 --> 3754.119
i think i even i learned this originally

3750.319 --> 3754.119
in the waldorf school

3755.44 --> 3759.839
not sure

3757.68 --> 3759.839
or

3776.319 --> 3779.319
wow

3789.039 --> 3794.3190000000004
what is the word for that in dutch i

3792.4 --> 3796.42
think that's the word i'm looking for i

3794.319 --> 3801.909
don't even recognize it

3796.42 --> 3801.909

3803.92 --> 3806.2400000000002
what

3806.72 --> 3811.839
your class

3808.72 --> 3811.839
what the

3814.0 --> 3818.06
i think i'm gonna try to search the

3815.76 --> 3831.789
entire thing in dutch

3818.06 --> 3831.7889999999998
[Music]

3843.2 --> 3847.7599999999998
oh that's

3845.119 --> 3848.96
much more easy to oversee for me

3847.76 --> 3850.559
micas

3848.96 --> 3853.839
that's it

3850.559 --> 3853.8390000000004
that's the one

3854.16 --> 3860.319
so it's quartz

3856.319 --> 3860.319
feldspar and micas

3863.039 --> 3866.2400000000002
oh that's called

3864.64 --> 3868.5589999999997
biotite

3866.24 --> 3870.799
or muscovite right

3868.559 --> 3873.119
now i remember it

3870.799 --> 3876.16
god it's so difficult sometimes learning

3873.119 --> 3878.96
a lot of these things in the dutch

3876.16 --> 3881.0389999999998
where it's like com different words like

3878.96 --> 3882.4
detailed words are different it's very

3881.039 --> 3885.039
confusing

3882.4 --> 3885.039
from english

3886.64 --> 3889.359
but that's it

3889.68 --> 3894.52

3922.96 --> 3927.119

3924.72 --> 3928.9599999999996
okay seeking style water

3927.119 --> 3930.0
weird

3928.96 --> 3932.2400000000002
really

3930.0 --> 3934.559
you rub them together and it gives like

3932.24 --> 3934.5589999999997
what

3935.359 --> 3938.5589999999997
i've never seen that

3938.96 --> 3942.559
and i have a lot of quartz crystal

3942.96 --> 3948.76
but then again i'm very very careful

3945.52 --> 3948.7599999999998
with them

3959.599 --> 3962.599
what

3972.24 --> 3975.24
hmm

3985.119 --> 3991.079
i bought a quartz crystal when i have to

3987.68 --> 3991.0789999999997
dig it out

3997.359 --> 4000.5989999999997
oh wait

4007.52 --> 4014.079
ah i have too much

4010.72 --> 4014.0789999999997
and keep track well

4018.559 --> 4022.4
i have so many minerals just

4022.88 --> 4026.7200000000003
surreal

4025.28 --> 4029.119
much i've

4026.72 --> 4031.1189999999997
collected over the years over the

4029.119 --> 4033.599
decades

4031.119 --> 4035.039
even though i kind of like stopped 10

4033.599 --> 4036.88
years ago

4035.039 --> 4039.28
entirely and

4036.88 --> 4040.799
i'm glad i did

4039.28 --> 4043.8390000000004
because i don't know where the hell i

4040.799 --> 4043.839
would have put all of this

4046.24 --> 4051.0389999999998
i mean if i would have gone on i would

4048.64 --> 4054.52
now need like an entire room just to

4051.039 --> 4054.5200000000004
display it

4064.64 --> 4070.839
thanks for being here ah

4067.039 --> 4070.8390000000004
i think i got it

4078.16 --> 4081.16
hmm

4091.44 --> 4094.96
see i have this hobby

4096.4 --> 4100.48
for a while where i was

4100.96 --> 4105.6
like very carefully picking apart quartz

4103.759 --> 4109.839
crystals like

4105.6 --> 4109.839
dissect them without breaking them

4113.04 --> 4116.44
dark closet

4122.239 --> 4124.5599999999995
okay

4126.96 --> 4130.56
right

4127.839 --> 4133.359
so that i could get like pure

4130.56 --> 4136.0
crystals out of there like this

4133.359 --> 4137.839
from original pieces

4136.0 --> 4140.719
like this

4137.839 --> 4143.92
so this was once one piece

4140.719 --> 4146.64
don't remember how it fit together

4143.92 --> 4149.359
all right like this haha

4146.64 --> 4152.0
and i just dissected it

4149.359 --> 4154.0
because i want like pure pieces like

4152.0 --> 4156.08
this

4154.0 --> 4158.88
pieces that are not

4156.08 --> 4161.6
like polished or cuts that are exactly

4158.88 --> 4165.679
as they crystallize originally

4161.6 --> 4168.08
because that there's something to that

4165.679 --> 4172.1990000000005
but yeah you get

4168.08 --> 4172.199
left with a lot of remnants

4178.239 --> 4181.919999999999
fire fire

4179.679 --> 4181.92
no

4185.04 --> 4189.159
i'm really curious though

4191.679 --> 4196.1990000000005
it will do anything you know

4206.96 --> 4209.679
i'd probably have to

4208.64 --> 4212.56
like

4209.679 --> 4214.719
designate a crystal for sacrifice just

4212.56 --> 4216.2390000000005
to do that

4214.719 --> 4218.4800000000005
i don't know if i want to do that with

4216.239 --> 4218.48
this

4224.56 --> 4227.76
then again there is like if for

4226.56 --> 4230.96
gardening

4227.76 --> 4233.1990000000005
one time i bought just like giant pieces

4230.96 --> 4235.04
of quartz crystal which are like junk

4233.199 --> 4236.96
quartz crystal not beautiful at all but

4235.04 --> 4240.8
it was like cheap

4236.96 --> 4240.8
it's the big boulder of quartz

4241.76 --> 4247.52
and i used it to grind it up

4244.8 --> 4250.0
and then try to make electric batteries

4247.52 --> 4250.0
with them

4251.44 --> 4255.839999999999
it has to be dark to see that but it act

4253.92 --> 4259.159
are you guys actually saying it it

4255.84 --> 4259.159000000001
really works

4261.679 --> 4267.12
i almost started my court script that is

4264.48 --> 4269.919999999999
very interesting

4267.12 --> 4273.5199999999995
never heard of that where which experts

4269.92 --> 4276.4800000000005
and who says that never heard anybody

4273.52 --> 4278.88
say experts say that fire was started by

4276.48 --> 4278.879999999999
course

4281.199 --> 4285.678999999999
i know there's an electric spark

4283.44 --> 4286.96
in quartz right that's why it even used

4285.679 --> 4289.76
in

4286.96 --> 4289.76
in watches

4297.52 --> 4304.400000000001
stop it

4300.56 --> 4304.400000000001
it's not funny it's just lame

4312.96 --> 4318.2390000000005
so since i'm lazy

4315.199 --> 4319.36
i think i'm just gonna find a youtube

4318.239 --> 4323.4
video

4319.36 --> 4323.4
where somebody does that

4340.84 --> 4347.6
ah that's crushing it though

4344.64 --> 4350.76
that i thought so it is it comes free in

4347.6 --> 4350.76
the crushing

4357.6 --> 4361.6
so here's like

4359.44 --> 4366.5199999999995
the light effect you're talking about

4361.6 --> 4366.52
when drilling inside the quartz

4402.719 --> 4408.56
yeah very interesting

4405.12 --> 4410.8
because i knew that i knew that like

4408.56 --> 4414.719
destroying it breaking that's i don't

4410.8 --> 4417.52
like that i don't like destroying chords

4414.719 --> 4421.28
if you know what i mean

4417.52 --> 4421.280000000001
rub them gently together

4421.44 --> 4428.879999999999
okay six do i i will try it out like

4426.48 --> 4431.36
tonight when it's really dark i'm just

4428.88 --> 4435.4800000000005
not gonna do that right now

4431.36 --> 4435.48
see if i'm gonna see anything

4455.99 --> 4459.05
[Music]

4491.679 --> 4499.28
i think it is shaving though

4495.679 --> 4500.88
so this is not like passive rubbing

4499.28 --> 4503.679
right this is not

4500.88 --> 4505.1990000000005
like two perfectly flat surfaces no this

4503.679 --> 4507.92
seems like he's like

4505.199 --> 4510.239
using it as sandpaper on itself like

4507.92 --> 4513.12
yeah that's gonna literally wear it off

4510.239 --> 4514.718999999999
i don't like that that means so oh you

4513.12 --> 4516.5599999999995
want to see some light that means

4514.719 --> 4520.0
destroy it then

4516.56 --> 4522.400000000001
how about i don't do that how about that

4520.0 --> 4524.08
how about i don't just destroy quartz

4522.4 --> 4526.08
crystals because they want to see some

4524.08 --> 4529.5599999999995
twinkly lights

4526.08 --> 4529.5599999999995
how about that

4549.6 --> 4554.320000000001
i i can't watch that i can't watch

4552.159 --> 4556.08
facebook stuff singing star wars but

4554.32 --> 4558.4
fine look i'll

4556.08 --> 4561.199
as you say gently

4558.4 --> 4563.839999999999
because i'm not gonna like shave

4561.199 --> 4565.599999999999
[ __ ] off my crystals like that just to

4563.84 --> 4567.679
get a bit of light going

4565.6 --> 4570.96
so i'm gonna try what you say this

4567.679 --> 4572.64
evening when it's like really dark

4570.96 --> 4575.12
and then i'll see if there's anything

4572.64 --> 4578.280000000001
visible

4575.12 --> 4578.28
all right

4581.28 --> 4586.159
so it it is what i thought it was m

4583.52 --> 4586.159000000001
appeal then

4592.88 --> 4597.36
all right so it's just like oh destroy

4594.64 --> 4598.88
the crystal oh look at its soul slip

4597.36 --> 4603.199
away

4598.88 --> 4605.28
as you destroy its body yes oh

4603.199 --> 4607.36
how about we don't do that because we're

4605.28 --> 4609.679
freaking bored and we have no sense of

4607.36 --> 4610.96
what we're doing with the world

breaking apart clusters more destructive

it leaves the pure

4646.8 --> 4651.679
crystal

4648.8 --> 4653.76
like with clear surfaces and all that i

4651.679 --> 4654.88
don't see that more destructive as at

4653.76 --> 4656.96
all

4654.88 --> 4658.8
they're like chaotic parts that if you

4656.96 --> 4662.4800000000005
just leave them it's much more likely

4658.8 --> 4666.320000000001
they're gonna break because they are

4662.48 --> 4670.5599999999995
like things sticking out

4666.32 --> 4670.5599999999995
much more prone to breaking by accident

4674.4 --> 4677.96

4716.8 --> 4721.28
and i mean i do have like the

most amazing quartz crystal i've ever

4721.28 --> 4726.719
seen i do have that

4724.48 --> 4729.36
of course

4726.719 --> 4732.08
that i got from the dark world like i

4729.36 --> 4734.32
can't the shop that i got this from

4732.08 --> 4735.44
didn't exist when i tried to find it

4734.32 --> 4736.719
back

4735.44 --> 4738.5599999999995
so yeah

4736.719 --> 4741.679
i do have the most amazing piece of

4738.56 --> 4745.0
quartz crystal that i've ever seen

4741.679 --> 4745.0
that's right

4753.76 --> 4757.280000000001
but

4754.88 --> 4761.159000000001

pretty much everything if it has like a

informative stream yeah

4958.639 --> 4962.0
i'm taking it easy today

4965.36 --> 4971.199
what does quartz do in a wristwatch uh

4968.32 --> 4973.5199999999995
it gives a very steady electric pulse

4971.199 --> 4976.719
that is being used to

4973.52 --> 4979.040000000001
anchor the timing

4976.719 --> 4981.36
of the mechanical systems

4979.04 --> 4982.719
right so it's basically the it's the

4981.36 --> 4987.5199999999995
heart

4982.719 --> 4989.6
that sets the the beat of time

4987.52 --> 4991.280000000001
that's how they use it that's how they

4989.6 --> 4993.04
use quartz

4991.28 --> 4995.04
i'm not kidding that that's literally

4993.04 --> 4997.84
how they use it

4995.04 --> 5000.08
boris johnson has resigned yep

4997.84 --> 5001.360000000001

there's a lot of interesting

5001.36 --> 5004.08

5004.239 --> 5008.36
in the last 24 hours

5036.04 --> 5042.04

5167.92 --> 5172.159
and you're gonna get a dog and you're

5169.76 --> 5177.56
gonna name it boris is it gonna be a

5172.159 --> 5177.5599999999995
goofy long-haired looking dog then

5202.32 --> 5206.32
yeah i'm really hoping that uh boris is

5204.719 --> 5208.639
gonna set a trend

5206.32 --> 5210.5599999999995
for the dutch cabinet as well because

5208.639 --> 5214.400000000001
they really think it's time for them to

5210.56 --> 5214.400000000001
get the [ __ ] out

5216.32 --> 5220.239
like

5218.0 --> 5220.239
like

5222.32 --> 5226.96
i'd like to see them in jail

5226.159 --> 5229.36
but

5226.96 --> 5232.2390000000005
maybe not here because i do kind of want

5229.36 --> 5235.199
to banish them like

5232.239 --> 5239.12
how about you just never ever come back

5235.199 --> 5241.678999999999
to the netherlands ever again

5239.12 --> 5244.96
upon penalty of life in prison

5241.679 --> 5244.96
outside of the netherlands

5245.36 --> 5248.759999999999
i don't know

5253.84 --> 5260.2390000000005
i think in reality we should just like

5257.28 --> 5262.96
european unelected parliament [ __ ] and

5260.239 --> 5264.4
klaus schwab and his [ __ ] cult and

5262.96 --> 5266.2390000000005
all that garbage

5264.4 --> 5268.239
i think we should lock them up in the

5266.239 --> 5269.839999999999
tower of babel

5268.239 --> 5271.678999999999
i think that we should use their

5269.84 --> 5274.159000000001
supposed

5271.679 --> 5274.159
castle

5275.12 --> 5279.04
as their prison

5276.719 --> 5283.12
and just lock them up in there just like

5279.04 --> 5284.0
okay this is now going to be your prison

5283.12 --> 5286.719
right

5284.0 --> 5289.52
remember that stupid tower of babel

5286.719 --> 5291.76
building in belgium

5289.52 --> 5294.56
supposedly the part like that should be

5291.76 --> 5298.08
turned into a prison

5294.56 --> 5302.080000000001
to house them

5298.08 --> 5302.08
as prisoners in prison

5302.719 --> 5307.4
i think that would be a proper

5308.56 --> 5313.719
karmic twist

5310.4 --> 5313.719
to the situation

5345.52 --> 5351.159000000001
[Music]

5348.159 --> 5351.159
nah

5354.48 --> 5358.239
unless

5356.4 --> 5360.96
you want to force them to become

5358.239 --> 5363.36
carpenters i mean

5360.96 --> 5365.52
maybe that is the ultimate thing the

5363.36 --> 5367.12
ultimate punishment for

5365.52 --> 5368.96
for these people in government that

5367.12 --> 5370.8
think they can rule over everybody is

5368.96 --> 5371.76
that they should just be for they should

5370.8 --> 5374.2390000000005
be

5371.76 --> 5376.96
like builder body systems

5374.239 --> 5379.36
like they should be forced to attain a

5376.96 --> 5381.28
very basic profession and then just do

5379.36 --> 5385.199
that the rest of their life

5381.28 --> 5385.199
as secondary class citizens

5386.719 --> 5391.04
like yeah you're going to be a carpenter

5388.48 --> 5394.5599999999995
the rest of your life to make up for the

5391.04 --> 5394.56
crazy [ __ ] that you pulled

5394.719 --> 5401.0
and like you can't own

5397.199 --> 5401.0
things and all that

5407.92 --> 5413.28
right it's basically oh everything that

5410.239 --> 5415.04
they wanted for us

5413.28 --> 5417.679
they're gonna get

5415.04 --> 5418.639
so we can use their castle as their

5417.679 --> 5421.28
prison

5418.639 --> 5423.12
well they are going to be subjected in

5421.28 --> 5424.8
that entire period

5423.12 --> 5427.199
by the policies that they were going to

5424.8 --> 5430.4800000000005
put on us so they

5427.199 --> 5434.678999999999
will owe nothing and be happy about it

5430.48 --> 5434.678999999999
they will eat the bugs

5435.6 --> 5439.52
i think that

5437.28 --> 5442.32
that would make an outlook like that

5439.52 --> 5445.040000000001
would make a lot of people

5442.32 --> 5445.04
very happy

5447.44 --> 5451.839999999999
right and that way

5449.199 --> 5454.799999999999
they get to test their system

5451.84 --> 5456.400000000001
yeah oh on their cells but they hey they

5454.8 --> 5458.2390000000005
at least uh

5456.4 --> 5462.199
contest how well it works

5458.239 --> 5462.199
huh is it was it realistic

5462.32 --> 5467.0
we'll find out you do it

5480.08 --> 5483.84
okay gross clep ruckus

5482.239 --> 5486.5599999999995
gross

5483.84 --> 5488.56
i mean most politicians are just filled

5486.56 --> 5491.280000000001
with pharmaceutical garbage anyway so

5488.56 --> 5492.8
they're going to make poor fertilizer

5491.28 --> 5494.719
like

5492.8 --> 5498.56
no it's better to

5494.719 --> 5500.4
it sounds weird but it's better to just

5498.56 --> 5502.2390000000005
have to have them subjected to

5500.4 --> 5504.879999999999
everything that they were gonna subject

5502.239 --> 5507.44
everybody else too but themselves

5504.88 --> 5511.84
flip it inside out

5507.44 --> 5511.839999999999
force them to repent to clean up

5515.28 --> 5518.8
right

5516.4 --> 5519.759999999999
transform the darkness locked within

5518.8 --> 5521.679
them

5519.76 --> 5523.52
see if that's possible

5521.679 --> 5525.52
maybe it won't be possible maybe at the

5523.52 --> 5527.1990000000005
end of it they'll be like smiling oh yes

5525.52 --> 5529.4400000000005
yes master

5527.199 --> 5531.678999999999
oh we learned a lesson and then as soon

5529.44 --> 5534.0
as we're like okay it's enough now then

5531.679 --> 5536.0
they immediately go back to their sneaky

5534.0 --> 5538.0
trick [ __ ]

5536.0 --> 5539.52
and yeah maybe then

5538.0 --> 5541.44
the woodshed

5539.52 --> 5544.080000000001
at least they're gonna be like clean

5541.44 --> 5545.5199999999995
enough to be used as fertilizer after

5544.08 --> 5549.199
that point

5545.52 --> 5551.6
okay this sounds very harsh with

5549.199 --> 5553.839999999999
i'm just saying

5551.6 --> 5556.8
i think

5553.84 --> 5559.360000000001
it would be more satisfying for the

5556.8 --> 5561.28
public that when they're caught and

5559.36 --> 5563.44
taken down taken out of power that they

5561.28 --> 5565.44
would be subjected

5563.44 --> 5568.96
to everything that they were going to

5565.44 --> 5568.96
subject the world to

5570.32 --> 5574.96
and that everybody can just see

5572.4 --> 5577.12
like here they are

5574.96 --> 5579.76
living the agenda that they wanted for

5577.12 --> 5582.239
us but not them and now they're getting

5579.76 --> 5584.56
it i think that would be much more

5582.239 --> 5586.718999999999
salving

5584.56 --> 5588.88
all this chaos that they have unleashed

5586.719 --> 5591.36
upon our world in like the last few

5588.88 --> 5591.36
decades

5600.159 --> 5605.5199999999995
he'll freeze over

5601.679 --> 5605.52
you don't know that gadget inspector

5607.44 --> 5612.4
i mean i am not going to eat bugs

5610.08 --> 5614.32
and i'm definitely not going to be happy

5612.4 --> 5618.48
with owning nothing

5614.32 --> 5621.12
and i will go to any crazy length

5618.48 --> 5625.12
whether it is psychologically or

5621.12 --> 5626.719
with physical aggression somehow

5625.12 --> 5628.84
i will not

5626.719 --> 5631.28
let them sit on that

5628.84 --> 5634.32
throne i will not

5631.28 --> 5634.32
it's not going to happen

5635.04 --> 5638.56
it's going to be very tiresome getting

5637.04 --> 5640.8
them off there

5638.56 --> 5645.360000000001
but they will not

5640.8 --> 5648.320000000001
be sitting there unabated they will not

5645.36 --> 5648.32
it's gonna end

5648.56 --> 5653.76
like it's gonna end or we end and then

5651.76 --> 5654.88
it's all over

5653.76 --> 5659.159000000001
get it

5654.88 --> 5659.159000000001
it's them or us

5664.32 --> 5669.12
and it's going to be there

5666.8 --> 5671.6
just look at how freaking weak and

5669.12 --> 5672.719
pathetic they are and ignorant they are

5671.6 --> 5674.2390000000005
like

5672.719 --> 5678.199
they're not gonna

5674.239 --> 5678.199
be victorious in this

5687.36 --> 5693.119
i own almost nothing now and i am really

5690.32 --> 5693.119
already happy

5699.52 --> 5704.159000000001
well

5700.4 --> 5706.5599999999995
you may think you own almost nothing but

5704.159 --> 5709.36
i think that the amount of things that

5706.56 --> 5711.92
you could own could dramatically be

5709.36 --> 5711.92
reduced

5712.239 --> 5715.44
and then we'll see if you're still going

5713.84 --> 5717.52
to be as happy right because it's not

5715.44 --> 5718.239
about you not having it it's about you

5717.52 --> 5720.96
not

5718.239 --> 5723.839999999999
uh being allowed

5720.96 --> 5724.719
to claim it as your own

5723.84 --> 5727.4400000000005
yeah

5724.719 --> 5729.6
or you might use tools but what if you

5727.44 --> 5732.0
literally don't have a say over those

5729.6 --> 5732.0
tools

5732.08 --> 5736.239
ever

5733.52 --> 5738.159000000001
yeah own nothing

5736.239 --> 5740.4
you really think that's going to be

5738.159 --> 5741.599999999999
happiness

5740.4 --> 5744.719
no

5741.6 --> 5746.400000000001
no look if you're clinging to material

5744.719 --> 5748.719
greed

5746.4 --> 5750.08
then owning more is not going to make

5748.719 --> 5752.56
you happier it's just going to make you

5750.08 --> 5753.76
more stressed out more greedy

5752.56 --> 5754.56
right

5753.76 --> 5756.56
but

5754.56 --> 5761.1990000000005
if you're literally like

5756.56 --> 5764.96
disowned from being able to own anything

5761.199 --> 5767.599999999999
by some rule system like communism

5764.96 --> 5770.4800000000005
uh that's not good that then you're

5767.6 --> 5772.159000000001
literally like you're just a slave

5770.48 --> 5773.839999999999
you don't have anything you're just

5772.159 --> 5775.5199999999995
lending tools

5773.84 --> 5777.04
you can't even claim it as your own you

5775.52 --> 5778.8
can't even have a moment where you're

5777.04 --> 5782.88
like no mine

5778.8 --> 5785.52
you're not even allowed that basic

5782.88 --> 5787.679
basic response then that's not going to

5785.52 --> 5790.8
make you happy it's going to make you a

5787.679 --> 5790.8
miserable slave

5792.239 --> 5796.759999999999
that's right happy people have options

5821.14 --> 5824.56
[Music]

5825.199 --> 5829.199
all right well then white

5826.88 --> 5831.92
it's a very simple formula as even to

5829.199 --> 5835.199
why right

5831.92 --> 5835.1990000000005
misery likes company

5836.159 --> 5840.5599999999995
money likes company

5838.0 --> 5842.56
somebody has a lot of money than other

5840.56 --> 5843.92
people that have a lot of money will be

5842.56 --> 5846.080000000001
drawn to it

5843.92 --> 5848.4800000000005
in the instinctual hope that they might

5846.08 --> 5851.36
add it to their own so the one sitting

5848.48 --> 5854.638999999999
on that money will automatically

5851.36 --> 5856.799999999999
be considered a either a prey or an

5854.639 --> 5858.8
enemy to be taken down

5856.8 --> 5861.679
so you're going to be surrounded by

5858.8 --> 5864.2390000000005
people that just want that money then

5861.679 --> 5864.96
instead of being free from that money

5864.239 --> 5867.5199999999995
and

5864.96 --> 5869.36
having natural free responses from

5867.52 --> 5871.92
people to your character

5869.36 --> 5871.92
so yeah

5877.679 --> 5884.4800000000005
the more money you have the more

5879.84 --> 5887.119000000001
miserable you will be inclined to become

5884.48 --> 5889.919999999999
that that's just gonna happen

5887.119 --> 5895.239
because of the people that are gonna

5889.92 --> 5895.2390000000005
swarm you for having that much money

5900.45 --> 5903.5199999999995
[Music]

5922.159 --> 5926.638999999999
shut up all right knuckle womble you

5924.48 --> 5928.32
sneaky bastard

5926.639 --> 5931.36
you're gonna have to donate to my paypal

5928.32 --> 5931.36
just for saying that

5936.56 --> 5940.56
no it's not true it's not entirely not

5939.04 --> 5942.48
true what happens

5940.56 --> 5944.56
universally

5942.48 --> 5947.5199999999995
is that

5944.56 --> 5949.4400000000005
more money makes me more

5947.52 --> 5951.76
content

5949.44 --> 5952.799999999999
being more content

5951.76 --> 5954.96
makes me

5952.8 --> 5957.679
well less anxious

5954.96 --> 5959.76
and when i'm anxious i do kind of out of

5957.679 --> 5961.84
desperation get a little bit more

5959.76 --> 5964.56
creative

5961.84 --> 5967.4400000000005
it's like help i'm trying to claw my way

5964.56 --> 5969.92
out of this bad position right

5967.44 --> 5972.96
so in that sense having less money there

5969.92 --> 5975.4400000000005
is always like i see it as the god

5972.96 --> 5978.0
escape option

5975.44 --> 5982.638999999999
where it works out anyway i just pull

5978.0 --> 5984.8
more out of my soul to keep it going

5982.639 --> 5988.96
but that does not make me happy not

5984.8 --> 5988.96
having money does not make me happy

5989.52 --> 5993.6
and having more money does not make me

5992.0 --> 5995.52
unhappy

5993.6 --> 5998.8
it just makes me

5995.52 --> 6001.6
calm down so i'm less desperate and

5998.8 --> 6004.400000000001
because of the lower desperation

6001.6 --> 6007.119000000001
a little less inclined to be creative i

6004.4 --> 6009.44
guess right that's about it

6007.119 --> 6012.32
doesn't mean there isn't any creativity

6009.44 --> 6015.119
left it just means that i have

6012.32 --> 6017.679
some time to calm the [ __ ] down so my

6015.119 --> 6019.92
body stops degenerating and breaking

6017.679 --> 6020.88
apart

6019.92 --> 6024.08
yeah

6020.88 --> 6026.4800000000005
because all that stress is still warning

6024.08 --> 6028.8
wearing on my entire physique it's

6026.48 --> 6032.08
probably

6028.8 --> 6037.08
cutting down my entire lifespan whenever

6032.08 --> 6037.08
that happens just so you know

6039.84 --> 6046.1990000000005
much money would be enough for you

6043.199 --> 6046.199
what

6053.679 --> 6058.88
what do you mean

6055.44 --> 6062.28
you mean per year or something and

6058.88 --> 6062.28
i don't know

6072.48 --> 6076.959999999999
i don't know territ i don't know

6077.679 --> 6082.159
by the way thank you fiber oats for the

6079.92 --> 6085.1990000000005
super chat donation i appreciate the the

6082.159 --> 6085.199
deed with the word there

6090.8 --> 6096.400000000001
right now my priority set is just to be

6093.44 --> 6100.96
able to survive and

6096.4 --> 6100.96
be fed and not degenerate too much

6103.52 --> 6108.88
that's my priority and i think that's a

6105.44 --> 6112.0
lot less than 400 000 a year

6108.88 --> 6114.719
but i can definitely think of a way to

6112.0 --> 6116.4
figure out how to spend that much money

6114.719 --> 6119.119
better

6116.4 --> 6121.36
i could go into more directions with my

6119.119 --> 6125.36
creativity

6121.36 --> 6125.36
if i had that much money available

6141.82 --> 6145.0
[Music]

6172.96 --> 6178.2390000000005
laying down has not been a good way to

6175.36 --> 6178.239
make money from it

6183.119 --> 6187.839999999999
i don't know what that means exactly but

6187.92 --> 6191.84
could mean variety of things

6198.32 --> 6201.719
i don't know

6205.44 --> 6209.199
i'm sure you'd be able to look that up

6207.28 --> 6212.0
steamy traveler i

6209.199 --> 6212.0
i don't know

6214.639 --> 6220.8
i'm i'm very certain i'm way under that

6218.4 --> 6224.04
norm line

6220.8 --> 6224.04
for sure

6237.28 --> 6240.639
if i were

6238.56 --> 6242.719
happy and secure would it still do the

6240.639 --> 6245.36
show every day

6242.719 --> 6249.119
i would probably not do this show the

6245.36 --> 6249.119
way that i have been doing it

6250.639 --> 6254.639
i would

6252.719 --> 6257.28
try to take

6254.639 --> 6261.04
the show or my activities online if you

6257.28 --> 6262.639
will into other directions right i mean

6261.04 --> 6264.56
there's all kinds of things that have

6262.639 --> 6266.08
potentially been like oh that's an

6264.56 --> 6268.159000000001
interesting idea to do that's an

6266.08 --> 6271.199
interesting day that's that and that and

6268.159 --> 6274.719
that well if i had much more financial

6271.199 --> 6276.799999999999
security then maybe i could attempt to

6274.719 --> 6279.6
start doing those things

6276.8 --> 6281.04
right i could add that onto what i do

6279.6 --> 6284.88
online

6281.04 --> 6284.88
reformat myself who knows

6286.88 --> 6293.92
but i'm not going to literally do this

6291.52 --> 6296.639
specific type of show set up anymore

6293.92 --> 6297.76
then because i'm doing this for the long

6296.639 --> 6299.76
haul

6297.76 --> 6302.320000000001
this is my little fisher boat on the

6299.76 --> 6304.08
ocean

6302.32 --> 6305.679
i don't really feel i have another

6304.08 --> 6306.639
choice like this is just what i got to

6305.679 --> 6309.4400000000005
do

6306.639 --> 6312.0
i'm very lucky still with the setup

6309.44 --> 6314.839999999999
relatively to my overall position

6312.0 --> 6318.239
financially and all that

6314.84 --> 6320.400000000001
and i'm just happy i got this little

6318.239 --> 6322.48
fisher boat right now

6320.4 --> 6324.799999999999
right but if i suddenly got a lot more

6322.48 --> 6326.159
money then yeah i would

6324.8 --> 6328.4800000000005
upgrade

6326.159 --> 6331.5199999999995
and then it wouldn't be the same anymore

6328.48 --> 6334.5599999999995
wouldn't it so

6331.52 --> 6336.8
but yeah before we theorize

6334.56 --> 6338.639
but oh what would it be like if irwin

6336.8 --> 6341.84
had more money and did

6338.639 --> 6344.400000000001
that's so [ __ ] nice

6341.84 --> 6346.88
why'd you give it to me then yeah

6344.4 --> 6349.839999999999
stop making me fantasize about being

6346.88 --> 6351.119
[ __ ] rich when i have absolutely no

6349.84 --> 6354.88
power

6351.119 --> 6356.4
at this point to actually attain that

6354.88 --> 6358.8
it annoys me

6356.4 --> 6360.4
don't make me [ __ ] fantasize about

6358.8 --> 6365.1990000000005
that okay

6360.4 --> 6368.159
unless you are gonna make me become that

6365.199 --> 6368.159
pisses me off

6368.4 --> 6372.638999999999
i'm done fantasizing about oh what could

6370.88 --> 6374.639
it do with all the money oh [ __ ] all

6372.639 --> 6378.88
that money i'm not getting it so why

6374.639 --> 6378.88
should i waste my time longing for it

6383.46 --> 6387.8
[Music]

6384.8 --> 6387.8
ah

6405.119 --> 6411.04
okay clutch so you're saying that it's

6407.199 --> 6411.04
36 000 euros

6411.119 --> 6416.48
so that would be like 3 000 euros a

6413.44 --> 6416.48
month yeah well

6417.36 --> 6419.759999999999
i mean

6420.239 --> 6424.32
i'm not even close and then like

6422.96 --> 6426.84
between

6424.32 --> 6430.32
one third and a half of that

6426.84 --> 6430.32
so yeah

6432.08 --> 6437.92
then again i don't have massive

6434.88 --> 6438.88
cost posts to fill all that money up

6437.92 --> 6440.8
with

6438.88 --> 6443.84
right because that is typically what

6440.8 --> 6443.84
happens out there

6473.04 --> 6476.56
all right yeah good point m appeal

6477.04 --> 6479.92
yeah

6477.92 --> 6482.4
it's been two hours that's gone quick

6479.92 --> 6482.4
hasn't it

6483.44 --> 6485.839999999999
right

6486.4 --> 6491.92
maybe those crystals you rub together it

6488.8 --> 6493.52
just changed the course of time

6491.92 --> 6495.76
yeah

6493.52 --> 6498.0
anyhow i'm rounding out the show

6495.76 --> 6499.84
fpd yeah it's already started up so i am
