46.86 --> 52.949
Google Hangouts who some of you will

52.949 --> 62.07
also in chat so yeah thanks for coming

57.6 --> 63.899
out on the scene on my show no you're

62.07 --> 65.489
welcome I saw on your on your last

63.899 --> 68.1
hangout you didn't have anyone with you

65.489 --> 71.07000000000001
to the stuff but I thought I'd give you

68.1 --> 75.57
a give you a ping say hey I'm hanging

71.07 --> 78.44999999999999
around doing not much well yeah it's

75.57 --> 80.29899999999999
early run you know and I'm surprised I

78.45 --> 82.71000000000001
have so as many guests as I do

80.299 --> 85.89
but yeah remain if you remember flat

82.71 --> 88.08
earth debates at the start a lot of the

85.89 --> 91.14
first episode he was also completely

88.08 --> 92.78999999999999
alone and then so no it just started

91.14 --> 94.46
running in and the eventually there was

92.79 --> 96.9
a row

94.46 --> 98.49
so nobody kind of happening here to be

96.9 --> 101.04
flooded the bytes from the starter and

98.49 --> 103.67999999999999
he started watching about maybe five or

101.04 --> 108.18
six months ago been looking into this

103.68 --> 111.36000000000001
stuff for less than a year well yeah

108.18 --> 113.759
it's gonna take a month to catch up on

111.36 --> 116.52
everything but I was there pretty much

113.759 --> 118.38
from the start or at least I was keeping

116.52 --> 121.28999999999999
sure I knew it was there I was already

118.38 --> 125.579
active with my own YouTube thing doing

121.29 --> 130.20000000000002
my flatter Talks hangouts and then I

125.579 --> 132.48
think like episode 40 or something or

130.2 --> 133.67999999999998
maybe earlier I don't remember I started

132.48 --> 139.23
joining in

133.68 --> 146.459
like a hellhole but it's a lot better

139.23 --> 149.25
now and a lot stricter so but yeah it is

146.459 --> 153.56900000000002
what it is and very amusing and it is

149.25 --> 156.269
really an open ground many ways we're

153.569 --> 161.28
unusual levels of hostility are

156.269 --> 163.769
basically just allowed that's that

161.28 --> 166.379
sounds like a Viking it's on the

163.769 --> 169.53
internet watching the Flat Earth debates

166.379 --> 171.48
the the the the venom that some of the

169.53 --> 174.0
trolls are spewing in the chat is like

171.48 --> 175.61999999999998
nothing I've ever seen before looking

174.0 --> 177.45
into other things other conspiracy

175.62 --> 180.03
theories you don't you don't get that

177.45 --> 182.36999999999998
much that much hostility oh I haven't

180.03 --> 185.37
seen it before or anything else it's not

182.37 --> 187.5
strange you know surreal no it's not

185.37 --> 193.469
really surreal when you start to think

187.5 --> 197.37
oh hey good morning to you too

193.469 --> 203.4
hey we were just talking about you

197.37 --> 209.43
behind your back now discussing just the

203.4 --> 212.81900000000002
trolls in at the debates and I was about

209.43 --> 217.609
to explain that why they get so nasty is

212.819 --> 220.79899999999998
because with Flat Earth we are touching

217.609 --> 224.12900000000002
we are taking away their dream because

220.799 --> 227.84900000000002
the globe is like a giant dream very

224.129 --> 231.92999999999998
similar in nature to the effect of being

227.849 --> 234.17999999999998
in love and that is just a fact that I

231.93 --> 236.87900000000002
think that's even chemically provable

234.18 --> 239.34
that there is a correlation between like

236.879 --> 241.349
fantasizing about this outer space and

239.34 --> 245.329
science fiction the feelings many people

241.349 --> 251.129
have from that and of being in love

245.329 --> 255.78
literally trust me on this I'll turn out

251.129 --> 259.919
to be right in this with a religious

255.78 --> 264.229
belief right well I guess that people

259.919 --> 267.45
that really love God in church also

264.229 --> 272.15999999999997
experience similar feelings

267.45 --> 277.9
and in a way I guess that

272.16 --> 282.1
yeah like Glover's I myself including

277.9 --> 285.78999999999996
really wanted to defend it like like

282.1 --> 288.04
Christians would defend Jesus for

285.79 --> 293.23
slander it's the same kind of impulse

288.04 --> 296.64000000000004
the same kind of system yeah it really

293.23 --> 299.71000000000004
is a religion but it's routed in in

296.64 --> 306.06
chemical feeling you could say of being

299.71 --> 311.28999999999996
in love that's what it's routed in in my

306.06 --> 316.18
psychological layman's opinion you see

311.29 --> 323.83000000000004
the dude on the panel oh that's Latroy

316.18 --> 326.83
is insulted six six seven nightly good

323.83 --> 329.02
night how you doing what I know the name

326.83 --> 332.26
and you've got really weird thumb now

329.02 --> 335.38
what is that thumb now it's a it's a

332.26 --> 340.96
dude it's a dude drinking a beer on a

335.38 --> 347.74
deck chair on surfboard that's new right

340.96 --> 350.53
there now gasps my yeah no the the one

347.74 --> 352.33
that the one that I use usually there is

350.53 --> 354.78999999999996
a character called Grendel it's an old

352.33 --> 364.99
comic book character Dark Horse comic

354.79 --> 382.24
book character from the eighties it's

364.99 --> 385.21000000000004
okay are you on the road again so what

382.24 --> 387.39
were we talking about before the trolls

385.21 --> 392.62
oh yeah I think we were talking about

387.39 --> 395.59
cannabis policy in the Netherlands it's

392.62 --> 397.87
crazy how it works like there's coffee

395.59 --> 401.169
shops everywhere that's the place where

397.87 --> 404.169
you can legally buy cannabis

401.169 --> 406.599
but you can grow it well you can grow it

404.169 --> 410.31899999999996
on a personal level as in if you have a

406.599 --> 413.889
house then you can have three plants it

410.319 --> 415.659
is now but if somebody is gonna report

413.889 --> 418.539
like a complaint about the snow or

415.659 --> 420.99899999999997
anything then yeah the police will take

418.539 --> 425.11
them away basically and if you have like

420.999 --> 429.249
a real aggro area that's just by default

425.11 --> 431.529
illegal it's insane so counterproductive

429.249 --> 434.879
because this way the criminal industry

431.529 --> 438.039
will drive the black market will drive

434.879 --> 444.31
the developments in the cannabis and it

438.039 --> 446.8
will become more commercialized in a bad

444.31 --> 448.9
way it will become more addictive all of

446.8 --> 453.49
that because there is no regulation

448.9 --> 455.62
because of this policy so we're talking

453.49 --> 458.919
about yet joining me we're talking about

455.62 --> 460.99
that before the show started so it's a

458.919 --> 465.56899999999996
good point to bring up because there's a

460.99 --> 469.569
lot you can do once you actually

465.569 --> 471.909
officially legalize cannabis nationwide

469.569 --> 474.339
then you can have certain regulations

471.909 --> 476.409
and that has some downsides to it

474.339 --> 479.469
but it also has a lot of upsides because

476.409 --> 482.949
for example like with the taxes on

479.469 --> 486.189
alcohol if a product like for say beer

482.949 --> 490.21000000000004
as a low elk which has a low alcohol on

486.189 --> 492.37
average it will have less taxes because

490.21 --> 496.33
of the low alcohol but it will have some

492.37 --> 498.31
and then wines and that level has a

496.33 --> 500.409
little bit more taxes and then the real

498.31 --> 503.8
strong drinks have a lot of taxes and

500.409 --> 506.83
this is logical not because we want to

503.8 --> 509.319
pay taxes but because people that really

506.83 --> 511.96
get addicted to alcohol will typically

509.319 --> 514.779
climb up the ladder to the stronger

511.96 --> 517.149
drinks and so if people are going to buy

514.779 --> 520.75
strong drinks that usually will

517.149 --> 523.659
correlate with more costs medically thus

520.75 --> 525.79
they are paying with the taxes for their

523.659 --> 528.88
own medical future basically and that's

525.79 --> 529.899
a good principle it all depends on

528.88 --> 532.449
what's going to happen with all that

529.899 --> 534.13
money though but yeah if that would

532.449 --> 534.6099999999999
actually fall in place that could work

534.13 --> 536.26
and you

534.61 --> 542.1
could do the same with cannabis and say

536.26 --> 544.899
okay if it has a very strong THC then

542.1 --> 547.39
from a certain level on it's gonna have

544.899 --> 549.1
some taxes to it when it's very strong

547.39 --> 552.399
it's gonna have even more taxes because

549.1 --> 555.519
that will typically be used by people

552.399 --> 558.64
that get really addicted and like chain

555.519 --> 560.769
smokers they will seek out the stronger

558.64 --> 562.87
cannabis so and that will also bring

560.769 --> 565.14
some problems with it at the same time

562.87 --> 568.51
you can have a reduction tax

565.14 --> 571.72
counterweights based on the CBD level

568.51 --> 575.35
because even smoking CBD will have to be

571.72 --> 578.0500000000001
a bit more than usual because smoking it

575.35 --> 581.14
will deteriorate the quality of it

578.05 --> 583.8389999999999
basically what you're inhaling but CBD

581.14 --> 586.0889999999999
will counter way any negative side

583.839 --> 588.6700000000001
effects or a lot of them open make your

586.089 --> 590.8000000000001
body more healthy and does any mental

588.67 --> 592.4799999999999
problems you might contract from

590.8 --> 598.51
constantly being exposed to high levels

592.48 --> 601.51
of THC will be will be taken by the body

598.51 --> 604.87
because you have plenty of CBD that will

601.51 --> 608.74
actually help you restore and cope with

604.87 --> 612.3
it so if you have a tax system based on

608.74 --> 616.8100000000001
the CBD and its THC then you can really

612.3 --> 618.79
get a good culture going for what types

616.81 --> 621.64
of cannabis are going to be produced in

618.79 --> 626.89
what way in what setting corporate or

621.64 --> 630.399
just freelance see legalization you can

626.89 --> 634.0
do so much with it and you can have some

630.399 --> 636.339
taxes not to just any more taxes we need

634.0 --> 638.23
more taxes but to actually build a

636.339 --> 642.519
foundation for what its gonna cause in

638.23 --> 647.1990000000001
the world so that was my little little

642.519 --> 650.079
political speeches what do you guys

647.199 --> 656.1099999999999
think any evidence that the tax applies

650.079 --> 659.05
to me no only if you're gonna sell it to

656.11 --> 661.269
others and then what would you what

659.05 --> 662.29
would be the evidence that applies to me

661.269 --> 664.57
if I

662.29 --> 668.05
well I understand but is that evidence

664.57 --> 669.85
or is that just a threat that's that's a

668.05 --> 672.8199999999999
threat but it's played out in the real

669.85 --> 675.82
world that's that's evidential what

672.82 --> 678.6700000000001
actually happens is evidential as far as

675.82 --> 680.38
okay right so that's a it's just like

678.67 --> 686.4
with any other product look if you're

680.38 --> 689.92
gonna sell cigarettes or I don't know

686.4 --> 692.62
food potatoes and you're gonna

689.92 --> 695.1999999999999
constantly sell that and if aid the text

692.62 --> 696.97
then yeah eventually you will be taken

695.2 --> 698.83
notice off and you will be like hey why

696.97 --> 701.53
aren't you paying like everybody else

698.83 --> 703.6600000000001
yeah if your principal yeah where you

701.53 --> 706.24
can make you can do other thing you can

703.66 --> 709.86
do your thing you can even win but I'm

706.24 --> 713.26
just trying to be pragmatic here and

709.86 --> 717.07
actually create a solution that can

713.26 --> 720.25
arrive now and not after everything is

717.07 --> 721.7800000000001
all perfect no now okay I was just

720.25 --> 723.22
asking and the other one the other

721.78 --> 724.93
gentleman said basically that the

723.22 --> 726.73
evidence is violence that's fine I know

724.93 --> 728.53
there's violence I know there's cages I

726.73 --> 731.74
know there's guns but that's not

728.53 --> 735.22
evidence at the law or the codes or tax

731.74 --> 737.29
are morally responsible that's the only

735.22 --> 739.36
always threads I'm not trying to say

737.29 --> 741.67
that it is but it's it's it's what

739.36 --> 743.62
actually happens in the real world if

741.67 --> 745.03
you well if you try not to pay your

743.62 --> 746.86
taxes or anything that that's what

745.03 --> 749.41
happens to you and that's happened to

746.86 --> 751.9
millions and millions of people what you

749.41 --> 756.0699999999999
want but seriously just get a trail of

751.9 --> 760.54
evidence think of it sir what we want is

756.07 --> 764.38
good cannabis that is healthy how can

760.54 --> 766.3299999999999
you steer that with taxes and what

764.38 --> 769.06
happens with the Texas is an entirely

766.33 --> 772.2
different matter but it is one of the

769.06 --> 774.52
only ways that can actually work

772.2 --> 776.74
otherwise people are just going to do

774.52 --> 780.31
what their impulses are going to tell

776.74 --> 782.29
them which will be greed right it's just

780.31 --> 785.29
the strong strong make addicts out of

782.29 --> 787.0
everyone that's not what once we have

785.29 --> 789.55
here in California something called the

787.0 --> 791.98
gas tax now the gas tax was supposed to

789.55 --> 795.9799999999999
be for the roads however many decades

791.98 --> 798.35
ago the gas tax was taken away and

795.98 --> 799.7
put into the general fund and now just

798.35 --> 802.85
recently they wanted to have another

799.7 --> 804.7700000000001
taxed to take care of the roads and same

802.85 --> 806.9
idea with the lottery the lottery was

804.77 --> 809.81
put in to take care of the schools and

806.9 --> 813.17
it goes to the general fund so my car I

809.81 --> 816.3499999999999
I don't see any evidence and and we have

813.17 --> 818.4799999999999
spoken to we have spoken to tax

816.35 --> 819.98
authorities on the phone and when we

818.48 --> 822.65
asked them for evidence that it actually

819.98 --> 824.33
applies to us we've been hung up on so

822.65 --> 827.48
there are folks that are figuring out

824.33 --> 828.95
that the taxes don't apply to us and and

827.48 --> 831.02
but if you want to go ahead and pay them

828.95 --> 835.6700000000001
that's fine personally I don't but

831.02 --> 840.73
that's a bad policy structuring you

835.67 --> 843.89
should collect taxes for one thing and

840.73 --> 846.34
here I just wanna hear you elaborate a

843.89 --> 848.6899999999999
bit what why doesn't it apply to us

846.34 --> 850.19
where's that well at least over here in

848.69 --> 851.8100000000001
the states where's evidence that it does

850.19 --> 853.5500000000001
where's the evidence that the code

851.81 --> 858.1999999999999
applies to us and then what they'll say

853.55 --> 860.2099999999999
is it oh well here at at one 15.7 we see

858.2 --> 862.6400000000001
that it applies to you I'm sorry that's

860.21 --> 864.44
circular logic you're taking a book to

862.64 --> 872.96
claim that the book applies to you it's

864.44 --> 875.99
not evidence but look you're going to

872.96 --> 878.98
another level and in that level if

875.99 --> 881.57
you're gonna assume that position fine

878.98 --> 885.1700000000001
everything is legal go do whatever the

881.57 --> 889.5500000000001
[ __ ] you want dude because that's very

885.17 --> 890.87
simple do whatever you want okay don't

889.55 --> 892.7299999999999
get angry I'm just saying legal and

890.87 --> 895.04
lawful or a different game legal has to

892.73 --> 898.9
do with the Bar Association lawful has

895.04 --> 902.8399999999999
to do with moral and what's right I

898.9 --> 903.65
didn't use the word lawful use legal I

902.84 --> 906.2800000000001
know

903.65 --> 909.89
legal is the legal is the scam work

906.28 --> 912.26
right to which we are most of us are

909.89 --> 914.99
also objected unless you want to make a

912.26 --> 918.05
great deal of effort your entire life

914.99 --> 919.58
and specialize to counter it because

918.05 --> 922.4
that's what you're gonna have to do if

919.58 --> 927.38
if you want to bypass it and that option

922.4 --> 930.0699999999999
is there so good luck to you I I'm not

927.38 --> 930.07
one of those people

939.23 --> 945.8100000000001
Eric question I think he wants to join

942.68 --> 949.2299999999999
the the thing about legal unlawful and

945.81 --> 951.0
whether whether things apply to you what

949.23 --> 952.6800000000001
do you think about the Constitution as a

951.0 --> 955.65
citizen of the country do you think the

952.68 --> 957.5999999999999
Constitution applies to you I have no

955.65 --> 959.1
evidence that adust you have evidence at

957.6 --> 960.9300000000001
the Constitution that was written 200

959.1 --> 962.91
years ago by a bunch of freemasons

960.93 --> 964.8299999999999
applies to many of it I'm not talking

962.91 --> 967.05
about evidence I'm asking whether or not

964.83 --> 971.0400000000001
you consider that it applies to you I

967.05 --> 972.9
would guess that you don't I don't I I

971.04 --> 974.79
look for evidence I haven't seen

972.9 --> 976.74
evidence that it does a contract signed

974.79 --> 979.0799999999999
200 years ago by a bunch of Masons I

976.74 --> 981.0600000000001
don't see how that applies to me whether

979.08 --> 983.0400000000001
or not you consider it to apply to you

981.06 --> 987.029
do you abide by the Constitution here I

983.04 --> 992.61
think that is a good and proper law of

987.029 --> 996.93
the land or do you you take the total

992.61 --> 1000.23
analyst view and say that no law is a

996.93 --> 1002.51
good law I I take basically I think Eric

1000.23 --> 1003.9200000000001
and I share pretty much the same ideas I

1002.51 --> 1006.02
haven't seen any evidence that the

1003.92 --> 1007.61
Constitution applies to me someone

1006.02 --> 1009.38
actually will show me that it does I'll

1007.61 --> 1011.0
be happy to agree but right now I don't

1009.38 --> 1012.56
see it that's what I look for is

1011.0 --> 1014.0
evidence I don't have beliefs I don't

1012.56 --> 1018.3499999999999
have claims I just looked for evidence

1014.0 --> 1021.29
haven't seen it yet the opinion not for

1018.35 --> 1023.0
evidence and I just told you I don't I

1021.29 --> 1024.4389999999999
try not to have beliefs or opinions I'm

1023.0 --> 1026.54
just looking for evidence I haven't seen

1024.439 --> 1029.8700000000001
it so far that a 200 year old contract

1026.54 --> 1032.8
created by Freemasons applies to me 200

1029.87 --> 1032.8
years later don't see it

1038.63 --> 1043.5
yeah I'm with Jim if you know if you

1041.76 --> 1045.57
guys want this is the whole nother thing

1043.5 --> 1048.9
it's kind of like flat earth when you're

1045.57 --> 1052.4099999999999
getting away from the globe look at it

1048.9 --> 1056.43
mark pastilles his channel he does a lot

1052.41 --> 1059.5800000000002
of good stuff on natural law and anarchy

1056.43 --> 1060.48
mark stevens does a really really really

1059.58 --> 1066.35
good job

1060.48 --> 1070.14
he's awesome this kind of stuff do I

1066.35 --> 1071.82
mean listen the guy even if one is sit

1070.14 --> 1073.44
in traditional oh you have things like

1071.82 --> 1075.3
contracts look you know when you get

1073.44 --> 1078.3300000000002
internet service you have a contract

1075.3 --> 1079.9199999999998
okay if you want to be there can we get

1078.33 --> 1082.73
to something like this and it might

1079.92 --> 1085.14
sound like a Trump Extreme as you know

1082.73 --> 1090.8700000000001
anarcho-capitalist but maybe we can

1085.14 --> 1093.42
switch the contracts at least at least

1090.87 --> 1098.3
you have an agreement there you know a

1093.42 --> 1101.25
bunch of men sitting in Washington DC

1098.3 --> 1106.32
making arbitrary rules it has to stop at

1101.25 --> 1110.07
some point that's I think what we all

1106.32 --> 1111.48
would say as far as text I mean we're

1110.07 --> 1113.6699999999998
not gonna just get rid of the system

1111.48 --> 1116.1200000000001
like I'm very much against the idea of

1113.67 --> 1120.63
income tax I think that's [ __ ]

1116.12 --> 1122.85
property tax I mean they have the us

1120.63 --> 1124.5300000000002
before the income tax they funded the

1122.85 --> 1128.1599999999999
government with just enough at what you

1124.53 --> 1129.66
call it in Europe of a fat basically

1128.16 --> 1138.3300000000002
anything imported and they were fine

1129.66 --> 1140.7
with that I don't think we read of all

1138.33 --> 1143.49
tax I mean for example it just snowed

1140.7 --> 1150.15
here last night the plows came out yeah

1143.49 --> 1151.74
I got a picture that's tough but I

1150.15 --> 1153.6000000000001
remember all the details but I've heard

1151.74 --> 1154.89
I've heard a decent explanation I kind

1153.6 --> 1158.03
of like that pretty much do away with

1154.89 --> 1161.16
tax altogether they're going back to it

1158.03 --> 1164.31
what they what they used to call it old

1161.16 --> 1166.3200000000002
same but they could print their own

1164.31 --> 1168.1
money you put it out government spend it

1166.32 --> 1169.9289999999999
out into circulation

1168.1 --> 1174.4599999999998
and then have the people spend that and

1169.929 --> 1176.1100000000001
and it comes back through a lot of in

1174.46 --> 1178.48
arcade you know the anarchist has become

1176.11 --> 1180.58
such a dirty work over decades that a

1178.48 --> 1182.679
lot of a lot of people use the word of

1180.58 --> 1185.35
voluntariness it's interesting that

1182.679 --> 1188.44
where I am it's more rural it's not like

1185.35 --> 1190.48
New York City who has a municipal fire

1188.44 --> 1193.03
department where I am it's all volunteer

1190.48 --> 1195.46
so we can do it we can provide services

1193.03 --> 1197.049
with I mean look how many but whether

1195.46 --> 1201.88
whether you like the churches or not

1197.049 --> 1204.07
they rely a lot on donations and so we

1201.88 --> 1208.69
can do these things I just think forcing

1204.07 --> 1210.6689999999999
people for services is immoral I mean

1208.69 --> 1212.23
especially not everyone uses old

1210.669 --> 1214.0
government services but you still have

1212.23 --> 1222.48
to pay your share of taxes to fund them

1214.0 --> 1223.63
yeah and now that you know then what

1222.48 --> 1226.75
Anthony

1223.63 --> 1228.3090000000002
Reilly he's doing like what if we

1226.75 --> 1231.309
learned that you know this school is

1228.309 --> 1232.4189999999999
there's no you know no nothing to tell

1231.309 --> 1234.72
the truth like I don't want to pay

1232.419 --> 1238.2700000000002
school taxes for a while to contribute

1234.72 --> 1243.73
children being I consider it mental

1238.27 --> 1245.98
abuse right and they have to get backs

1243.73 --> 1253.24
tonight it before they even show up yeah

1245.98 --> 1255.1
so I mean yeah I don't think we you know

1253.24 --> 1257.53
that we can just get rid of all forms of

1255.1 --> 1262.74
Taxation I mean I think we could start

1257.53 --> 1262.74
at some major ones

1265.32 --> 1271.74
I mean did anybody see the marketing

1268.8 --> 1274.29
campaign from Domino's Pizza whether you

1271.74 --> 1276.54
know private Pizza corporation is fixing

1274.29 --> 1279.06
roads in America because well the

1276.54 --> 1280.74
government sucks at it so you know who's

1279.06 --> 1282.72
gonna fix the roads if we don't have

1280.74 --> 1285.36
government well number one its people

1282.72 --> 1286.83
and maybe Domino's Pizza that's a sad

1285.36 --> 1292.9799999999998
reality of stuff isn't it

1286.83 --> 1294.51
I mean youyou guys if you repeat you

1292.98 --> 1297.09
guys in Europe you would look look at

1294.51 --> 1299.34
the Domino's add like dominos pizza the

1297.09 --> 1306.51
crappiest pizza around the street the

1299.34 --> 1310.05
roads in America yeah I know yeah look

1306.51 --> 1313.3799999999999
that the worst crap food is the most

1310.05 --> 1316.77
widely advertised so I've known that for

1313.38 --> 1320.0100000000002
like 20 years it's pretty smart when

1316.77 --> 1321.87
they say they Domino's Pizza painted and

1320.01 --> 1324.18
it makes people a you know a that pizza

1321.87 --> 1327.1499999999999
place they're fixed in my room it's

1324.18 --> 1328.5900000000001
quite brilliant actually but a free

1327.15 --> 1330.17
market I guess can do stuff that

1328.59 --> 1334.08
governments tok-san

1330.17 --> 1336.0600000000002
just pretty much everything I know I

1334.08 --> 1339.33
sound like a terrible capitalist saying

1336.06 --> 1341.07
suggesting these things I guess I look

1339.33 --> 1346.23
forward to capitalism if it ever is

1341.07 --> 1348.54
tried free market too many yeah free

1346.23 --> 1350.04
market what no barriers to entry what a

1348.54 --> 1351.45
what a concept but we have all these

1350.04 --> 1352.95
gentlemen that hide behind the corporate

1351.45 --> 1354.72
veil we have no idea who they are

1352.95 --> 1357.42
they're protected from any kind of

1354.72 --> 1359.6100000000001
prosecution and they lure our fisheries

1357.42 --> 1362.13
others like the United States as a

1359.61 --> 1363.6899999999998
corporation well in corporations as we

1362.13 --> 1365.97
see today that's an extension of

1363.69 --> 1368.67
government anybody who opposes this

1365.97 --> 1370.98
leftist you know Oh screw the equal rich

1368.67 --> 1373.6200000000001
men that of one-percenters all that bad

1370.98 --> 1377.22
sense those corporations Apple Google

1373.62 --> 1379.9799999999998
all these things Pfizer bear these are

1377.22 --> 1382.59
extension government you know there's if

1379.98 --> 1385.65
you're a family or private business you

1382.59 --> 1388.77
can't succeed you got you need to become

1385.65 --> 1391.68
an IPO traded on Wall Street you know

1388.77 --> 1393.69
buddy up good government that's the only

1391.68 --> 1396.3600000000001
way you're gonna get a service or

1393.69 --> 1397.91
product to market good luck being a

1396.36 --> 1401.32
family business

1397.91 --> 1409.1000000000001
private business in today's world all

1401.32 --> 1411.05
right but yeah my my typical regulation

1409.1 --> 1414.3799999999999
system and you don't like it especially

1411.05 --> 1416.69
Americans hate that but yeah if it's

1414.38 --> 1421.16
well applied it can be very functional

1416.69 --> 1423.29
and it can direct the quality of

1421.16 --> 1426.98
products in a good direction

1423.29 --> 1427.96
what we'll you can recap what you were

1426.98 --> 1434.51
talking about

1427.96 --> 1437.66
right well a sales tax on cannabis from

1434.51 --> 1440.42
a certain level on so that any guy can

1437.66 --> 1442.46
basically grow his stuff and just sell

1440.42 --> 1444.8000000000002
and to his friends or whatever but if

1442.46 --> 1447.01
you like if you're gonna take it to the

1444.8 --> 1450.23
next level like sell a huge quantity

1447.01 --> 1453.53
like get professional then there should

1450.23 --> 1458.09
be a tax based on the type of cannabis

1453.53 --> 1462.3799999999999
that you have so higher THC should have

1458.09 --> 1465.02
a exponentially growing as tax scale

1462.38 --> 1468.7700000000002
it's very similar to the alcohol concept

1465.02 --> 1470.84
but as a counterweight CBD levels and

1468.77 --> 1475.97
yeah that depends on the type of

1470.84 --> 1480.6999999999998
cannabis yet if the CBD level is higher

1475.97 --> 1484.7
then that will reduce the amount of tax

1480.7 --> 1489.89
being levied on the THC so that way you

1484.7 --> 1492.89
can steer the market - yeah to create a

1489.89 --> 1494.93
general type of cannabis that might be

1492.89 --> 1497.5400000000002
pretty good but it will at least have

1494.93 --> 1502.28
CBD and that will have a lot of medical

1497.54 --> 1506.09
benefits for people that yeah I know

1502.28 --> 1507.8
like so I guess Jim you know jumped on

1506.09 --> 1511.1899999999998
the whole idea of tax maybe he's a bit

1507.8 --> 1512.99
more I agree I agree but it's all about

1511.19 --> 1516.71
what you're going to be doing with those

1512.99 --> 1520.49
taxes yeah but listen listen please

1516.71 --> 1522.71
please nobody interrupt me please what

1520.49 --> 1525.23
the problem is in America we make the

1522.71 --> 1528.6200000000001
policy-making and taxes is that they

1525.23 --> 1530.48
just treated in an insane manner they

1528.62 --> 1531.6799999999998
say oh look we need the money for a

1530.48 --> 1533.38
project okay

1531.68 --> 1536.24
we're gonna take it from this that's

1533.38 --> 1539.48
terrible to do because it completely

1536.24 --> 1540.86
destabilized the the open market

1539.48 --> 1544.42
whatever that's gonna deal with it's

1540.86 --> 1547.9099999999999
gonna disrupt it but if you are gonna

1544.42 --> 1549.89
not do that not try to rip some money

1547.91 --> 1553.22
from something not try to rip money from

1549.89 --> 1556.0700000000002
cannabis and just let it be but use

1553.22 --> 1560.81
taxation to regulate it and then apply

1556.07 --> 1563.51
those taxes specifically for medical

1560.81 --> 1567.7
benefits for cannabis users for example

1563.51 --> 1570.92
like to fund typical issues that

1567.7 --> 1573.8
cannabis addicts or older people that

1570.92 --> 1577.04
have smoked a lot might have whatever's

1573.8 --> 1579.32
gonna it's gonna happen you know this is

1577.04 --> 1581.6599999999999
very rare people that just smoke pure

1579.32 --> 1584.3899999999999
cannabis that are super healthy in an

1581.66 --> 1587.66
age most people are yeah there are

1584.39 --> 1591.5300000000002
idiots with it and use a lot of bad food

1587.66 --> 1594.92
and anyway you can just take a bit of

1591.53 --> 1599.0
those incomes from cannabis and then use

1594.92 --> 1601.19
it for medical issues so that later on

1599.0 --> 1602.81
it's not going to be a huge burden on

1601.19 --> 1604.0700000000002
these people that aren't probably not

1602.81 --> 1607.1299999999999
going to be rich if they're going to be

1604.07 --> 1609.4399999999998
smoking a lot and yeah it's not gonna

1607.13 --> 1612.94
cost the taxpayer any extra money

1609.44 --> 1616.19
because there is some money for this see

1612.94 --> 1618.74
there Bennett's the taxes are directly

1616.19 --> 1622.42
funded into that market and that is your

1618.74 --> 1628.28
fair policy does this include like

1622.42 --> 1631.25
recreational cannabis usage now now as I

1628.28 --> 1634.6399999999999
said before it's only when you sell

1631.25 --> 1637.16
cannabis on a larger scale up from a

1634.64 --> 1638.8700000000001
certain amount on so anyone can

1637.16 --> 1641.18
basically grow their own stuff sell it

1638.87 --> 1643.6699999999998
to a bunch of friends even be a

1641.18 --> 1646.76
small-time local dealer if they like to

1643.67 --> 1648.5900000000001
be but once you get like when you're

1646.76 --> 1650.45
really going to industrialize it and

1648.59 --> 1652.85
you're going to make huge amounts of

1650.45 --> 1654.26
money then there's gonna have to be some

1652.85 --> 1657.11
kind of tax regulation or the

1654.26 --> 1659.84
corporations will purely determine the

1657.11 --> 1664.49
market on getting more make super-strong

1659.84 --> 1665.6799999999998
THC throw away the CBD to turn everyone

1664.49 --> 1667.81
into junkies

1665.68 --> 1669.75
then more more more more MORE that's

1667.81 --> 1673.3899999999999
what's gonna happen if you don't read

1669.75 --> 1676.14
and it's already happening it's already

1673.39 --> 1676.14
happening right now

1676.29 --> 1686.77
so yeah that's purely for regular

1680.88 --> 1693.13
regulatory measures that's why it's

1686.77 --> 1695.71
another approach so yeah think about it

1693.13 --> 1698.64
it's another approach that's all I don't

1695.71 --> 1701.65
like taxes either but mostly because

1698.64 --> 1704.0800000000002
politically people in politics just

1701.65 --> 1706.21
abuse it and they just think of some

1704.08 --> 1709.3899999999999
project and then rip money from an

1706.21 --> 1711.94
industry or from the general public to

1709.39 --> 1715.39
fund that and that is bad that is always

1711.94 --> 1717.25
bad if there's no Lee attacks in a

1715.39 --> 1720.25
certain region then that tax should go

1717.25 --> 1723.25
directly back to that region and then

1720.25 --> 1726.69
you can regulate it in a good way it's

1723.25 --> 1728.98
not gonna be a detriment to that sector

1726.69 --> 1729.67
so let me ask a question based on

1728.98 --> 1739.45
ignorance

1729.67 --> 1746.14
you know it seems to me Raza is not

1739.45 --> 1754.72
liking my much sorry Raza robot Travis

1746.14 --> 1757.96
you you broke down there yeah he yeah

1754.72 --> 1762.93
but he is aggro and he wants it just

1757.96 --> 1765.82
wants free reign and I get that you know

1762.93 --> 1767.44
well I mean all I see is the only way

1765.82 --> 1769.6
that these people collect taxes is they

1767.44 --> 1771.31
got guns violence in cages otherwise it

1769.6 --> 1775.06
wouldn't collect a dime they know it I

1771.31 --> 1777.4299999999998
know it yes Jimmy what do you think of

1775.06 --> 1779.44
just sales tax I mean I just put at

1777.43 --> 1782.65
least is especially like say luxury

1779.44 --> 1784.81
items like buying a Ferrari I think you

1782.65 --> 1789.7
know I think property income taxes

1784.81 --> 1792.3999999999999
should be wiped out and just but I think

1789.7 --> 1796.45
of VAT or you know luxury items like you

1792.4 --> 1799.0590000000002
know a Rolex or a certain range of car

1796.45 --> 1802.3300000000002
automobiles I

1799.059 --> 1805.4089999999999
guess we could use empathic tariffs okay

1802.33 --> 1807.789
hold on guys I need to address this now

1805.409 --> 1811.95
before this gets out of hand Rasta

1807.789 --> 1815.919
seriously dude I know I know cannabis

1811.95 --> 1818.169
THC CBD can't kill anyone

1815.919 --> 1820.179
it's never happened before ever you

1818.169 --> 1822.8500000000001
can't overdose and that's official I

1820.179 --> 1825.279
know that I'm not denying that but that

1822.85 --> 1828.9089999999999
doesn't mean that THC can screw up

1825.279 --> 1832.72
people if it's very strong and if their

1828.909 --> 1835.6000000000001
system is not balanced because it is a

1832.72 --> 1837.73
strong psychotropic and any psychotropic

1835.6 --> 1857.59
can do damage if the conditions are not

1837.73 --> 1860.8890000000001
right it's a fact no ignorant it seems

1857.59 --> 1865.899
to me an indiscriminate practice that

1860.889 --> 1870.1
you would wait until a product has a

1865.899 --> 1872.4989999999998
high volume of monetary gain before you

1870.1 --> 1875.799
start taxing it so it's almost like some

1872.499 --> 1877.299
mafioso in New York sees that a local

1875.799 --> 1879.73
business is actually doing really really

1877.299 --> 1881.47
well then he goes in and goes hey I like

1879.73 --> 1884.799
the piece of your pie you know what I'm

1881.47 --> 1886.509
saying but if it's a lower lower level

1884.799 --> 1888.999
he's not going to touch it because

1886.509 --> 1891.19
there's not much income to tax it seems

1888.999 --> 1892.6290000000001
indiscriminate that it should if you're

1891.19 --> 1894.759
gonna tax it's got to be straight across

1892.629 --> 1896.769
the board no matter what the level of

1894.759 --> 1901.029
volume and no matter what the level of

1896.769 --> 1904.029
quality because then at so let's say for

1901.029 --> 1909.279
instance you reached the you reach this

1904.029 --> 1912.85
certain indiscriminate plateau of volume

1909.279 --> 1914.32
sales and quality and then you start

1912.85 --> 1915.9989999999998
taxing like what's the thought be

1914.32 --> 1921.58
stopped behind that why start taxing at

1915.999 --> 1923.679
that point the question because it's

1921.58 --> 1926.769
worth that once it gets to a certain

1923.679 --> 1929.6190000000001
volume it's worth taking a slice right

1926.769 --> 1933.19
the whole thing right it's mafia it's

1929.619 --> 1936.28
the right in government his

1933.19 --> 1938.17
yeah once something gets big enough the

1936.28 --> 1939.7
the dudes with the gun say you're right

1938.17 --> 1941.74
that's big enough for us to take a slice

1939.7 --> 1943.0800000000002
it's worth yes it's worth the manpower

1941.74 --> 1945.76
the time you know if you're making

1943.08 --> 1950.23
selling apples go to the New York

1945.76 --> 1952.66
context you're selling apples it's not

1950.23 --> 1959.83
worth even the time and energy to send a

1952.66 --> 1961.15
couple of goons over there I don't

1959.83 --> 1963.6699999999998
believe in attacks I believe in

1961.15 --> 1965.3200000000002
voluntary donations you want something

1963.67 --> 1967.39
you want to use something you should

1965.32 --> 1970.12
donate to it but being forced to I'm not

1967.39 --> 1972.88
into that yeah I mean ultimately that's

1970.12 --> 1974.08
I agree with that I just don't think we

1972.88 --> 1977.2600000000002
can go from what we have now to

1974.08 --> 1978.97
completely voluntary no it's a long ways

1977.26 --> 1980.71
it's a long road I'm just putting it out

1978.97 --> 1982.24
in the you know in the long run that I

1980.71 --> 1984.1000000000001
think that would be an awesome system

1982.24 --> 1986.11
right yeah we have proved a lot of

1984.1 --> 1989.3799999999999
people will suggest a rule you know

1986.11 --> 1991.9299999999998
people are greedy yes because they said

1989.38 --> 1993.2800000000002
yeah I'm the church's survive how does

1991.93 --> 1996.5800000000002
the local fire departments

1993.28 --> 1998.68
that's all voluntary based on razors and

1996.58 --> 2000.99
whatever people people give their money

1998.68 --> 2006.21
to it so it's nonsense that we can't

2000.99 --> 2008.84
have a voluntary isabela system is it

2006.21 --> 2008.8400000000001
you already have

2014.13 --> 2024.0200000000002
I triggered somebody doing here yeah

2026.93 --> 2034.74
well I'm a big fan too you know but I'd

2032.64 --> 2036.3300000000002
pay attention I'm a fan of people doing

2034.74 --> 2037.29
whatever the hell they like as long as I

2036.33 --> 2040.74
don't hurt anyone

2037.29 --> 2042.6299999999999
I'm a former I'm a former stoner I don't

2040.74 --> 2044.49
do it personally anymore but I have no

2042.63 --> 2046.2600000000002
issues with anybody doing any kind of

2044.49 --> 2048.179
drugs it's your own business long as you

2046.26 --> 2050.159
don't injure another party if you and

2048.179 --> 2051.78
you're somebody else then the government

2050.159 --> 2053.2200000000003
shouldn't be collecting from you the

2051.78 --> 2054.84
person that you injured should be

2053.22 --> 2056.73
collected from you the government is not

2054.84 --> 2059.54
an injured party governments of fiction

2056.73 --> 2059.54
and of Randall

2060.83 --> 2074.639
agree it is pretty insane a non-entity

2067.23 --> 2076.56
charge and I'd say the county of right

2074.639 --> 2078.389
if you ever go to court for a speeding

2076.56 --> 2080.22
ticket ask um can I meet the state of

2078.389 --> 2081.96
California because that's the person

2080.22 --> 2084.149
that's claiming it's an injured party

2081.96 --> 2086.79
I'd like to meet mr. state of California

2084.149 --> 2088.169
yeah well the prosecutor here he's gonna

2086.79 --> 2089.61
talk to you about the state of

2088.169 --> 2092.129
California so you can talk to the

2089.61 --> 2093.659
prosecutor is this this is mr. state of

2092.129 --> 2095.5499999999997
California does he have first-hand

2093.659 --> 2105.75
evidence that the laws in Constitution

2095.55 --> 2110.69
apply the Constitution applies to me as

2105.75 --> 2113.88
I've asked in my Brady request are you

your honor has the prosecutor submitted

2117.69 --> 2120.51
evidence that the Constitution applies

2119.16 --> 2122.79
to me as I've requested in my brain

2120.51 --> 2124.4700000000003
requests and the prosecutor has

2122.79 --> 2126.41
addressed the question to you sir are

2132.27 --> 2136.41
constitutional laws apply to me all

2134.46 --> 2137.9700000000003
right it seems that the defendant

2136.41 --> 2139.68
doesn't understand the dynamics of

2137.97 --> 2141.0899999999997
what's happening right objection I'm

2139.68 --> 2141.3599999999997

2147.17 --> 2153.44
called using the Socratic method it's

2150.08 --> 2155.0299999999997
not like what what the judge would do or

2153.44 --> 2157.31
the prosecutor would do is now they

2155.03 --> 2159.26
would say oh I'm not gonna argue with

2157.31 --> 2161.87

getting clarification I wasn't asking a

2163.85 --> 2171.0499999999997
question so Anna Braga right and the

2176.18 --> 2179.66
waiting for the objection that I'm still

2177.8 --> 2181.28

2179.66 --> 2182.99
evidence that the laws in Constitution

2181.28 --> 2186.6800000000003
apply to me as I submitted in my Brady

2192.23 --> 2196.4900000000002
and codes apply to me see that's how it

2195.86 --> 2201.8
works

2196.49 --> 2204.1699999999996
the brown I won my case the prosecutor

2201.8 --> 2206.27
is trying to establish their whether or

2204.17 --> 2208.31
not the code the codes and laws apply to

2206.27 --> 2210.11
you by by establishing whether or not

2238.28 --> 2241.19
brandy request which is here which I

2240.02 --> 2243.79
like to have a copy of this Brady

2241.19 --> 2245.96
request looking for an answer to that

2243.79 --> 2248.45
you'll notice that in the brita request

2245.96 --> 2250.88
it stipulates that if the defendant

2248.45 --> 2252.9199999999996
alleged is objection it does not

2250.88 --> 2258.4100000000003
objection it says nothing of the sort

2295.49 --> 2302.4799999999996
Mark Stephens I think I think they kind

2299.42 --> 2305.57
of got into this mode of looking forward

2302.48 --> 2308.119
to being quarterly no how do these gets

2305.57 --> 2311.09
going to court a lot like I try to avoid

2308.119 --> 2312.6800000000003
that no we don't want to be in court but

2311.09 --> 2315.17
what we don't want to do in there is go

2312.68 --> 2317.33
from the end from the arraignment into

2315.17 --> 2319.4
trial we do not want to actually get it

2317.33 --> 2321.0499999999997
into the trial let me treat a trial it's

2319.4 --> 2322.7000000000003
or you want to deal with it in the

2321.05 --> 2324.4100000000003
arraignment and you want to deal with it

2322.7 --> 2326.48
with paperwork that's why that Brady

2324.41 --> 2327.95
request you get it in there it's asking

2326.48 --> 2328.79
does the laws and codes apply to me

2327.95 --> 2331.1299999999997
where's the evidence

2328.79 --> 2332.84
y'all dealing with evidence there's and

2331.13 --> 2335.21
there is no evidence that's why we ask

2332.84 --> 2336.65
the questions and you know for people

2335.21 --> 2339.349
that aren't familiar with this maybe in

2336.65 --> 2343.52
other words it's jurisdiction meaning

2339.349 --> 2345.02
you know do you have authority in this

2343.52 --> 2347.47
realm over me

2345.02 --> 2349.91
doodle-oo the cold statutes laws

2347.47 --> 2350.54
constitutions does it apply you have

2349.91 --> 2353.48
burst

2350.54 --> 2355.67
is this Admiralty court apply to me

2353.48 --> 2362.93
which is what it it does Namur to court

2355.67 --> 2364.01
I agree Ryan don't try this out in real

2362.93 --> 2366.2599999999998
life unless you've had a lot of

2364.01 --> 2369.17
experience with this stuff don't ever

2366.26 --> 2370.5200000000004
try it I tried it and first got my my

2369.17 --> 2373.9700000000003
ass handed to me but now I'm getting

2370.52 --> 2378.08
pretty good it's good for parking

2373.97 --> 2379.9399999999996
tickets or you know failure to stop and

2378.08 --> 2381.98
they'll say you can you can still end up

2379.94 --> 2383.39
in jail over a contempt you have to be

2381.98 --> 2385.609
very careful you're not asking questions

2383.39 --> 2387.3199999999997
you're only getting clarifications in

2385.609 --> 2395.0
there and you're putting the burden on

2387.32 --> 2399.8590000000004
the prosecutor not on the judge the

2395.0 --> 2401.27
other good thing is with the plea you

2399.859 --> 2403.96
know that's the other aspect you walk

2401.27 --> 2407.15
into a court and you're ready to play

2403.96 --> 2409.13
guaranteed just haven't signed it that

2407.15 --> 2410.9
so it shows your intent is ready to

2409.13 --> 2412.55
settle it they do it exactly right

2410.9 --> 2413.87
you're just looking you take in that

2412.55 --> 2416.6600000000003
sighing guilty plea you're on arm

2413.87 --> 2418.43
reiji's I'm ready to plead guilty I can

2416.66 --> 2421.8999999999996
just get a few clarifications number one

2418.43 --> 2424.7599999999998
am I considered innocent of all of all

2421.9 --> 2427.88
elements of the charge yes I just said

2424.76 --> 2429.2900000000004
we yes I am is jurisdiction one of the

2427.88 --> 2438.7400000000002
elements they're going to start freaking

2429.29 --> 2440.45
out now where's your jurisdiction please

2438.74 --> 2442.22
Ellie come on guys I mean whatever we

2440.45 --> 2444.52
think about government we all have to

2442.22 --> 2447.47
agree that it's just a monopoly on

2444.52 --> 2452.5
violence or the threat that's all it is

2447.47 --> 2452.5
it's a freemason mafia is all it is

2453.61 --> 2463.76
would you agree our two anarchistic for

2461.3 --> 2465.86
me but there is a lot of car telling

2463.76 --> 2468.0200000000004
problems in branches of government

2465.86 --> 2469.78
everywhere it's a structural problem

2468.02 --> 2474.62
it's how it came to be

2469.78 --> 2476.3900000000003
yeah but to say you know I think you

2474.62 --> 2482.3599999999997
guys tend to over generalize everything

2476.39 --> 2490.46
a lot I tried to take a more moderate

2482.36 --> 2492.8900000000003
approach yeah I've seen a lot of stuff

2490.46 --> 2494.2400000000002
I've seen a lot of people being tortured

2492.89 --> 2495.44
and whatnot with the so-called

2494.24 --> 2499.16
government with the Royal Canadian

2495.44 --> 2501.14
Mounted Police I'm not I'm not a fan of

2499.16 --> 2502.67
government mafia at all or the

2501.14 --> 2503.96
Freemasons that's what I talk about on

2502.67 --> 2507.86
my channel well you'll have to do it

2503.96 --> 2511.25
here but I talk about that a lot yay

2507.86 --> 2514.79
hooray this is not subject for the early

2511.25 --> 2516.02
bird show thank you we don't want to

2514.79 --> 2518.63
wake up to this [ __ ]

2516.02 --> 2519.8
no problem my show we don't have any

2518.63 --> 2526.88
kind of agenda you can speak about

2519.8 --> 2529.0
anything not to to like give people

2526.88 --> 2541.9700000000003
nightmares right after they wake up

2529.0 --> 2543.86
that's my agenda so what I want to do is

2541.97 --> 2546.6699999999996
basically give a little breathing room

2543.86 --> 2546.67
and just

2547.31 --> 2553.16
more guys what's your favorite color or

2550.05 --> 2553.1600000000003
what's your favorite color

2555.68 --> 2561.66
depends on the context really if I would

2559.83 --> 2583.5
just have to over generalize I'd say

2561.66 --> 2586.04
purple what's going on guys I'm going

2583.5 --> 2589.77
set up for the debate but a chocolate

2586.04 --> 2596.55
what's up nice probably see you there in

2589.77 --> 2599.13
a few minutes we were we got on a good

2596.55 --> 2602.3100000000004
subject last night about the number

2599.13 --> 2603.51
brought it up maneuver the MA

2602.31 --> 2605.58
what's that thing that the Chet the

2603.51 --> 2609.6000000000004
James Bond jetpack that they buried in

2605.58 --> 2614.48
the space religion yeah that's nm

2609.6 --> 2614.48
whatever it was a complete word uses I'm

2614.99 --> 2620.1899999999996
airspace it was a pack that they used

2617.49 --> 2626.8799999999997
once that they couldn't explain so yeah

2620.19 --> 2630.98
no mean um brought it up really good a

2626.88 --> 2633.869
jet practice can't be explained they

2630.98 --> 2638.19
another technology they sort of buried

2633.869 --> 2640.3500000000004
like the shuttle and ridiculous but he's

2638.19 --> 2642.3
promising to make a video on it the way

2640.35 --> 2645.39
they were explaining it does not line up

2642.3 --> 2648.27
to what they're claiming in orbital

2645.39 --> 2650.3689999999997
mechanics and hopefully I was just

2648.27 --> 2652.92
watching that episode earlier this

2650.369 --> 2656.4900000000002
morning you know you guys were

2652.92 --> 2658.32
destroying all that NASA footage that

2656.49 --> 2665.7
you guys are showing oh my god is so

2658.32 --> 2667.0800000000004
hard so bad we were pulling out 1980s

2683.49 --> 2687.66
you have a certain time that you're

2685.08 --> 2690.17
gonna start your hangouts or no I try to

2687.66 --> 2692.6099999999997
I just would people like Jamie and

2690.17 --> 2693.87
Rebecca and people are on there because

2692.61 --> 2697.25
they've all been good to me I just try

2693.87 --> 2700.29
to find an empty time didn't I collect

2697.25 --> 2702.96
what time are you like what what time

2700.29 --> 2712.8
zone are you in it's six o'clock a.m.

2702.96 --> 2714.59
right now unfortunately thankfully

2712.8 --> 2717.21
you're right

2714.59 --> 2718.86
I'm really close to the fire hundred

2717.21 --> 2720.63
miles away I went to school where the

2718.86 --> 2723.48
fire is taking everything down it's

2720.63 --> 2725.31
called the campfire that took down while

2723.48 --> 2728.19
I'm at the campfire Northern California

2725.31 --> 2729.57
the campfire is the largest fire ever in

2728.19 --> 2732.09
California and it's funny that the

2729.57 --> 2734.1000000000004
campfire took out paradise the town of

2732.09 --> 2736.38
paradise the campfire took out paradise

2734.1 --> 2738.74
let meanness that's assuming if you

2736.38 --> 2742.62
don't look at that saddle that satellite

2738.74 --> 2744.5699999999997
explosion that shot up in the sky I know

2742.62 --> 2748.5
it's just called the campfire

2744.57 --> 2750.96
that's the name people are gonna think

2748.5 --> 2754.95
that it was some random backpacker or a

2750.96 --> 2757.35
hiker that put out the fire in Gaza no

2754.95 --> 2760.8799999999997
it was a Rothschild on Pacific Gas &

2757.35 --> 2765.45
Electric Company just like the last few

2760.88 --> 2771.75
yeah yeah I was watching the fire come

2765.45 --> 2775.43
down over the mountain you're not up

2771.75 --> 2775.43
here in northern Cal now are you Travis

2777.05 --> 2781.26
there's two major fires going on one in

2779.73 --> 2782.91
Northern California which is the largest

2781.26 --> 2784.32
ever in California history and then

2782.91 --> 2786.72
there's one in Southern California which

2784.32 --> 2788.1000000000004
is also massive right now we never used

2786.72 --> 2789.9599999999996
to have fires last three years they've

2788.1 --> 2791.7599999999998
almost burnt down the whole state which

2789.96 --> 2794.16
of course the rest of the world is going

2791.76 --> 2796.05
yeah who burned down California until

2794.16 --> 2799.17
you start pricing fruits and vegetables

2796.05 --> 2800.4
because we put out most of them well

2799.17 --> 2802.23
that's good for the it'll be good for

2800.4 --> 2804.21
you know the economy a lot of rebuilding

2802.23 --> 2806.4900000000002
insurance and you know adjusters and

2804.21 --> 2809.46
going out there with their company cars

2806.49 --> 2812.58
and you know Lowe's will make a Lowe's

2809.46 --> 2813.2400000000002
Home Depot yeah but fruit industry is

2812.58 --> 2815.94
going to be

2813.24 --> 2819.6
because trees burned down you know takes

2815.94 --> 2821.58
years yeah we have almond almond trees

2819.6 --> 2823.04
up here taking a massive hit that's

2821.58 --> 2825.9
terrible

2823.04 --> 2828.54
well well they'll import somewhere in

2825.9 --> 2831.3
the rich rich people we we we actually

2828.54 --> 2837.17
we're the largest almond producer in the

2831.3 --> 2840.2400000000002
world here shucks I like my almond milk

2837.17 --> 2843.15
well what they do is uh it's according

2840.24 --> 2845.22
to law code they actually pasteurized

2843.15 --> 2847.4100000000003
the all the almonds so they take all the

2845.22 --> 2848.73
nutrition out of the damn almonds the

2847.41 --> 2850.23
only way you get good almonds you have

2848.73 --> 2852.15
to go up to a farm and buy them raw

2850.23 --> 2854.15
otherwise you'll never get them raw any

2852.15 --> 2857.4500000000003
more they're always pasteurized now I

2854.15 --> 2860.2200000000003
just used Oaks as a replacement for

2857.45 --> 2861.93
that's what I do too but you it's still

2860.22 --> 2863.3399999999997
pasteurized all the elements have been

2861.93 --> 2865.1699999999996
pasteurized which means they've been

2863.34 --> 2868.76
boiled and all the nutrition been taken

2865.17 --> 2870.9
out of okay yeah it was I wasn't

2868.76 --> 2872.7900000000004
consuming it for nutrition I'd rather

2870.9 --> 2875.2200000000003
wear that but I used some you know

2872.79 --> 2877.08
grains and nuts and granola and I didn't

2875.22 --> 2879.33
put that in there instead of cow milk

2877.08 --> 2881.0699999999997
that's what I do every morning I put my

2879.33 --> 2884.31
own put my oatmeal with berries and

2881.07 --> 2888.42
almond milk it's delicious I could taste

2884.31 --> 2890.0099999999998
it I even be happier I used to fall for

2888.42 --> 2892.94
the soy milk back in the old days until

2890.01 --> 2898.01
I learned what soy was it's ridiculous

2892.94 --> 2905.34
no soy boy here so a future girl right

2898.01 --> 2909.5400000000004
yeah no but sorry straight for old

2905.34 --> 2911.9700000000003
ladies yeah another good thing is Kahlua

2909.54 --> 2913.68
with cereal if you ever want some if you

2911.97 --> 2921.5099999999998
have a hangover I've done that a few

2913.68 --> 2922.29
times back in then some years ago it's

2921.51 --> 2932.7900000000004
pretty taste

2922.29 --> 2934.23
you said Kahlua which surreal next thing

2932.79 --> 2939.09
you're gonna tell me you put beer on

2934.23 --> 2941.6
your oatmeal no that's just a no-no I

2939.09 --> 2941.6000000000004
said

2943.07 --> 2949.02
I got to be pretty desperate like in a

2946.59 --> 2950.9100000000003
random part of Thailand to put ice on my

2949.02 --> 2961.2
beer where they just don't put the beer

2950.91 --> 2961.62
in the fridge like ah yeah so uh yeah

2961.2 --> 2964.74
yeah

2961.62 --> 2967.08
neither the show I'm gonna round out I

2964.74 --> 2970.62
think Nathan's about to start you

2967.08 --> 2974.63
already put out the link so any last

2970.62 --> 2974.63
thoughts before I run Oh

2983.07 --> 2989.73
pasteurization yeah well it's

2987.62 --> 2992.64
commercially convenient but it

2989.73 --> 2995.76
completely ruins the product in a

2992.64 --> 2998.79
terrible way so exact if you can look

2995.76 --> 2999.78
for the non vegans out there raw milk

2998.79 --> 3003.32
try it

2999.78 --> 3005.09
but yeah make sure you drink it right

3003.32 --> 3007.8500000000004
away because it doesn't last very long

3005.09 --> 3009.86
but that way it's actually healthy if

3007.85 --> 3014.48
it's organic very important but

3009.86 --> 3018.98
pasteurized milk it destroys the what's

3014.48 --> 3021.32
the name again the the protein it

3018.98 --> 3026.23
destroys destroys the milk protein and

3021.32 --> 3029.57
and that causes actually it to detract

3026.23 --> 3032.18
minerals from your body instead of

3029.57 --> 3036.8300000000004
providing them as they say it does it's

3032.18 --> 3041.0
very annoying decalcify bones for

3036.83 --> 3044.93
example so yeah drink raw milk don't use

3041.0 --> 3049.49
pasteurized milk you know it's a happy

3044.93 --> 3056.1499999999996
to just chuck it like that she's even

3049.49 --> 3058.7299999999996
better to discuss camel milk that's is

3056.15 --> 3060.8
very very special healthy milk has

3058.73 --> 3062.93
mended medical properties it's very

3060.8 --> 3067.9900000000002
interesting stuff and it tastes really

3062.93 --> 3070.7599999999998
nice so it's right out camel milk yep

3067.99 --> 3074.12
we'll try it anyway I'm gonna run out
