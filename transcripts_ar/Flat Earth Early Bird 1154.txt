right

93.6 --> 96.79899999999999
uh

94.88 --> 99.6
however the weather today is quite

96.799 --> 102.0
beautiful there's a bit of

99.6 --> 104.24
haze up there a little

102.0 --> 106.96
seems like planes are leaving something

104.24 --> 106.96
behind again

109.439 --> 113.75899999999999
but it's nice and bright and sunny

111.759 --> 116.799
despite that

113.759 --> 116.799
very windy though

117.759 --> 123.68
this constant wind blowing outside and

120.88 --> 123.67999999999999
it's kind of cold

125.36 --> 128.959
but yeah certainly behind the windows

127.92 --> 131.75900000000001
the sun

128.959 --> 131.75900000000001
very pleasant

140.84 --> 146.879
oh you

143.52 --> 148.239
hello psych bear first in chat

146.879 --> 151.92
m

148.239 --> 155.92000000000002
flatter sage good to see you all

151.92 --> 160.72
it is saturday the 12th of

155.92 --> 165.72
the 12th of jan february oh my god

160.72 --> 165.72
it's the 12th of february 2022.

166.08 --> 171.08
i don't know what that was

167.68 --> 171.08
right uh

173.599 --> 177.51899999999998
yeah

175.84 --> 179.76
took a shower

177.519 --> 181.92000000000002
had a pretty good night rest

179.76 --> 185.76
woke up to nice and bright sun so yeah i

181.92 --> 189.55999999999997
do feel good but i am also broke

185.76 --> 189.56
i just figured out

198.08 --> 200.56
oh well

201.44 --> 206.159
because yeah the paypal yesterday from

203.68 --> 206.15900000000002
who was it

207.519 --> 210.4
somebody's wife

210.959 --> 215.76
right yeah it's not arrived yet so i

214.0 --> 217.599
think that's probably jen

215.76 --> 219.67999999999998
gonna come on

217.599 --> 221.2
on monday so

219.68 --> 224.239
right but i can definitely use the

221.2 --> 226.64
paypal support because i am

224.239 --> 229.04
well broke right now

226.64 --> 232.48
that's no direct

229.04 --> 235.12
outlook that that's going to change

232.48 --> 237.599
but anyway

235.12 --> 239.04
besides money troubles i'm doing pretty

237.599 --> 241.92
good

239.04 --> 244.959
feel good yesterday was a pretty

241.92 --> 247.28
exhilarating day overall

244.959 --> 250.879
and the flat earth debate went on for a

247.28 --> 252.319
very long time

250.879 --> 254.879
like

252.319 --> 257.12
seven o'clock or something like really

254.879 --> 257.12
long

257.28 --> 260.95899999999995
it was a four more hours kind of day

261.28 --> 266.23999999999995
yeah and nathan even had

263.6 --> 268.0
two parter after show so he rounded out

266.24 --> 270.0
the after show at some part which was

268.0 --> 272.16
already quite long but then he still

270.0 --> 275.04
stayed and then another

272.16 --> 276.40000000000003
yeah he rounded out again

275.04 --> 278.40000000000003
because there was a lot of energy in the

276.4 --> 282.919
air and i was

278.4 --> 282.919
like really well focused

283.12 --> 286.96
put down some nice psychology and all

285.919 --> 289.59999999999997
that

286.96 --> 294.56
and everybody was really receptive for

289.6 --> 295.52000000000004
it as well so yeah was a very

294.56 --> 297.199
good

295.52 --> 299.919
flat earth debate

297.199 --> 299.91900000000004
this friday

300.479 --> 305.36
glad to have been part of it hey jeff

302.8 --> 305.36
gassett

308.84 --> 313.35999999999996
right

310.639 --> 315.12
and i was watching owen benjamin before

313.36 --> 319.40000000000003
this

315.12 --> 319.4
which is also very interesting

325.12 --> 327.44
all right

330.32 --> 337.28
oh and i also noticed by the way that

334.24 --> 339.68
the episode i talked about facts aids

337.28 --> 344.32
like that same day he

339.68 --> 344.32
did an episode about that too apparently

346.639 --> 353.36
he called it covades

349.759 --> 356.8
isn't that just like huh

353.36 --> 356.8
guess it was just the time

357.919 --> 362.79999999999995
but he called cov8 so i think that he

359.919 --> 362.79999999999995
tapped it out of

364.16 --> 369.28000000000003
the other channel

366.479 --> 371.919
i still think vax aids is much better

369.28 --> 375.71999999999997
because it is that straight

371.919 --> 375.71999999999997
forward the source

380.56 --> 385.44
but oh well

382.56 --> 385.44
it is a thing now

386.88 --> 390.44
hey tara 306

397.28 --> 399.67999999999995
dank

398.639 --> 402.0
oh

399.68 --> 404.40000000000003
wow thank you

402.0 --> 407.4
i really appreciate that i'll check my

404.4 --> 407.4
paypal

409.28 --> 411.84
good to see you

416.479 --> 420.199
thank you very much

432.72 --> 439.36
all right so i'll probably be

435.52 --> 442.08
a bit more sponsored this monday

439.36 --> 444.47900000000004
still i'm gonna have to like get some

442.08 --> 445.919
continued support i know it's

444.479 --> 450.4
it's annoying

445.919 --> 453.84
i think it's annoying it's just

450.4 --> 456.31899999999996
all the extra expenditures

453.84 --> 458.08
in january it is kind of just like a bit

456.319 --> 460.56
of a difficult period to come through to

458.08 --> 462.4
get through

460.56 --> 464.479
but

462.4 --> 467.039
i will eventually

464.479 --> 467.039
get there

472.319 --> 478.24
oh is it ipm biggest cricket tournament

476.08 --> 479.44
no terror 306 sorry i don't really

478.24 --> 483.44
follow

479.44 --> 483.44
sports in general really

487.44 --> 490.44
huh

492.16 --> 496.319
it's funny though that it's so cricket

494.479 --> 498.15999999999997
so big in india when it is like

496.319 --> 501.199
blatantly obviously

498.16 --> 503.59900000000005
british in origin

501.199 --> 508.319
so i guess some of their culture did rub

503.599 --> 508.319
off after all didn't it but that's okay

513.279 --> 519.519
oh my god the facts fainted again uh

518.0 --> 522.24
yeah

519.519 --> 522.24
that sucks

528.72 --> 535.9200000000001
you saw a video that said they were

531.68 --> 538.64
using hiv in the virus in the gym yeah

535.92 --> 540.88
jeff gas said that

538.64 --> 543.04
you saw that just now

540.88 --> 546.68
i mean i saw that on alex jones like

543.04 --> 546.68
over a year ago

549.76 --> 556.6
we will survive the winter

552.56 --> 556.5999999999999
sure we will psych bear

562.16 --> 566.0
hey carolyn a good to see you

568.64 --> 576.76
the auctioneer was from oh

571.92 --> 576.76
so the british guy fainted huh

589.36 --> 593.839
all right well yeah jeff gas head but

592.16 --> 597.4399999999999
look if you've been following the

593.839 --> 600.08
details and it's kind of like annoying

597.44 --> 601.9200000000001
fear poorly sometimes or a lot of the

600.08 --> 604.32
times has been

601.92 --> 605.76
watching it all

604.32 --> 608.5600000000001
but yeah there were already studies

605.76 --> 608.56
coming out that

608.8 --> 613.12
like taking the jabs

610.8 --> 615.1999999999999
basically makes your

613.12 --> 616.24
more important white blood cells than

615.2 --> 618.72
really

616.24 --> 620.5600000000001
just take care of business

618.72 --> 622.9590000000001
yeah this is not a very medical

620.56 --> 625.92
explanation but that's what they do

622.959 --> 627.8389999999999
that they become passive

625.92 --> 629.4399999999999
and the more you get it the more at some

627.839 --> 631.36
point they're just like they don't do

629.44 --> 632.5600000000001
anything they literally don't perform

631.36 --> 634.0790000000001
their function

632.56 --> 636.079
but they're still sitting there in the

634.079 --> 637.76
body so it's like your immune system

636.079 --> 639.1999999999999
becomes socialist

637.76 --> 640.24
and gay

639.2 --> 642.32
right

640.24 --> 644.8
well yeah that's

642.32 --> 648.0
that's pretty similar as to

644.8 --> 652.399
like the condition of

648.0 --> 652.399
hiv and aids and all that right

653.2 --> 657.6400000000001
that's what that's what happens

660.88 --> 664.8
that's yeah that's why they

663.519 --> 668.32
say

664.8 --> 670.88
it is caused or it is aids

668.32 --> 672.6400000000001
that's what happens now but supposedly

670.88 --> 676.48
coming from the virus when it's

672.64 --> 676.48
blatantly coming from injections

684.24 --> 692.279
right so yeah yet another reason not to

687.44 --> 692.2790000000001
take it oh like we need it anymore

708.079 --> 712.399
right so they're now i think they're

709.92 --> 715.5999999999999
probably by rolling this out they're

712.399 --> 718.399
literally gonna funnel

715.6 --> 720.72
the vax aids idiots into

718.399 --> 724.079
probably falci's uh

720.72 --> 726.48
azt program or something similar an

724.079 --> 728.7199999999999
updated version that's gonna do the same

726.48 --> 728.72
thing

729.2 --> 732.9590000000001
right

731.279 --> 734.56
and then they're going to get full-blown

732.959 --> 736.88
aids

734.56 --> 737.68
and then suddenly we got an actual

736.88 --> 740.24
health

737.68 --> 740.2399999999999
crisis

741.76 --> 747.639
that's pretty big

743.279 --> 747.639
but was definitely man-made

759.04 --> 764.959
right so yeah all these

761.92 --> 767.4399999999999
vacs addicted people

764.959 --> 769.1199999999999
these vax puppets they are now there

767.44 --> 771.2790000000001
just as

769.12 --> 773.839
mind control shields for the medical

771.279 --> 776.56
industrial complex

773.839 --> 779.36
because they will just take whatever

776.56 --> 781.5999999999999
is told to them a lot of the times or

779.36 --> 784.0
indirectly statistically

781.6 --> 785.6800000000001
so the facts industry can just

784.0 --> 788.32
like oh

785.68 --> 790.0
okay we need a crisis okay let's poison

788.32 --> 792.639
a bunch of people then blame it on

790.0 --> 792.639
something else

794.32 --> 798.8000000000001
yeah and they're going to keep doing

795.92 --> 802.24
that and now it's time for vax aids

798.8 --> 802.24
that's my prognosis

806.959 --> 810.8
would aids keep people in lockdown

811.279 --> 815.8389999999999
well yeah it's quite it's very crippling

816.72 --> 822.0790000000001
right it's total system shutdown in ways

819.76 --> 824.16
like your immune system shuts down and

822.079 --> 826.88
then suddenly at some point like the

824.16 --> 828.399
tiniest

826.88 --> 830.56
allergic response

828.399 --> 833.519
or

830.56 --> 836.0
or getting sick and you literally die

833.519 --> 838.32
from it or almost die from it

836.0 --> 840.16
you you literally degenerate you don't

838.32 --> 841.36
regenerate properly anymore it's

840.16 --> 843.92
terrible

841.36 --> 846.8000000000001
but it is a artificially created

843.92 --> 850.8
condition the body doesn't

846.8 --> 850.8
can't just naturally get that

853.839 --> 858.1600000000001
hiv is completely treatable now

858.399 --> 862.88
no law it never was a death sentence

864.88 --> 868.8389999999999
i think it

866.079 --> 871.12
yeah i don't exactly even know

868.839 --> 872.48
specifically the details of it i think

871.12 --> 876.32
that it's been

872.48 --> 877.44
part of like the deep cover of virus

876.32 --> 879.519
lore

877.44 --> 881.0400000000001
so it's already presuppositional a lot

879.519 --> 882.9590000000001
of it yeah that's

881.04 --> 885.279
hey i'm not a medical expert i haven't

882.959 --> 888.56
done like the detailed research i

885.279 --> 888.56
literally don't believe it

889.68 --> 892.399
i don't believe that

891.519 --> 894.5600000000001
it's

892.399 --> 897.279
a threat

894.56 --> 899.76
right it's not a virus you contract like

897.279 --> 901.279
that

899.76 --> 905.04
it's

901.279 --> 908.88
like the virus doesn't do anything

905.04 --> 908.88
unless you wreck your body

909.12 --> 912.639
unless you poison yourself then it

911.04 --> 915.519
becomes dangerous

912.639 --> 915.519
that's what i think

922.0 --> 926.279
right so yeah because

928.639 --> 930.88
like

932.399 --> 936.88
how do you explain that it's it's just

934.639 --> 939.6800000000001
based on the data right if you take all

936.88 --> 941.92
the things we've learned about how it's

939.68 --> 944.4799999999999
supposed to be working away and then

941.92 --> 946.4799999999999
just look at the data look what happens

944.48 --> 949.44
there's people that would

946.48 --> 950.72
like have sex with people that have hiv

949.44 --> 953.12
not know it

950.72 --> 956.1600000000001
and then they just wouldn't get it

953.12 --> 958.079
right how does that really make sense

956.16 --> 960.7199999999999
because they are going to be exposed to

958.079 --> 961.8389999999999
these presupposed viruses

960.72 --> 964.399
so

961.839 --> 967.0400000000001
they got in because they will right it's

964.399 --> 969.12
direct contact it's usually even like

967.04 --> 971.8389999999999
blood barrier contact slightly

969.12 --> 974.72
especially if you're gay

971.839 --> 975.9200000000001
you right

974.72 --> 978.72
and then

975.92 --> 981.04
you just don't get it

978.72 --> 982.9590000000001
like there is no logic behind that if

981.04 --> 985.759
it's really a virus then you should like

982.959 --> 986.6389999999999
always get it like always

985.759 --> 988.72
just

986.639 --> 991.199
because

988.72 --> 993.12
like what else happens with it just

991.199 --> 995.199
these virus just

993.12 --> 997.199
don't do anything then

995.199 --> 1000.0
you just wash your mouth flush him out

997.199 --> 1002.639
again like none of it makes sense when

1000.0 --> 1006.639
you really think about what's supposed

1002.639 --> 1006.639
to be happening according to the model

1009.04 --> 1012.3199999999999
you don't know

1010.399 --> 1015.12
you watched a guy in the early 90s with

1012.32 --> 1017.12
her away was he taking azt

1015.12 --> 1018.399
was he taking aids medication dino

1017.12 --> 1021.399
crisis

1018.399 --> 1021.399
huh

1024.079 --> 1028.8799999999999
yeah because

1026.48 --> 1029.6
from what i've learned

1028.88 --> 1033.439
the

1029.6 --> 1035.52
standard aids treatment is fatal

1033.439 --> 1039.039
this faux cheese drug didn't you know

1035.52 --> 1043.12
it's fauci's drug

1039.039 --> 1043.12
that was given to people with aids

1043.76 --> 1048.16
hello

1046.0 --> 1050.72
tell me you didn't know that by now

1048.16 --> 1055.64
because i've been saying that too

1050.72 --> 1055.64
it's real so admit it

1066.559 --> 1070.3999999999999
no correlation between aids and hf evil

1069.2 --> 1072.16
right

1070.4 --> 1075.919
well there's no correlation between

1072.16 --> 1075.919
viruses and anything like that

1079.039 --> 1083.039
aids is the condition

1081.2 --> 1086.72
that's what you actually get that's the

1083.039 --> 1091.039
immune shutdown it's because of poison

1086.72 --> 1091.039
azt that's what like caused it

1091.2 --> 1096.0800000000002
pretty directly like those that didn't

1093.76 --> 1098.72
take it was this guy named again like

1096.08 --> 1101.28
magic johnson or something

1098.72 --> 1103.3600000000001
he was like a famous person i don't know

1101.28 --> 1105.44
in sports or acting i don't know

1103.36 --> 1108.799
that got it he didn't take the treatment

1105.44 --> 1111.6000000000001
he's still alive today it's

1108.799 --> 1111.6
like yeah

1112.4 --> 1117.919
it's because it's the the supposed

1115.52 --> 1120.8799999999999
remedy that killed you

1117.919 --> 1123.8400000000001
it's a giant sadistic

1120.88 --> 1123.8400000000001
joke

1152.32 --> 1157.6
all right

1153.6 --> 1159.9189999999999
yeah george yeah i had an a hiv test

1157.6 --> 1163.8799999999999
once

1159.919 --> 1163.88
i think it was 99

1169.919 --> 1173.76
yeah i didn't have anything or at least

1172.24 --> 1176.32
that's what they told me because i

1173.76 --> 1179.84
didn't know what was going on

1176.32 --> 1179.84
i thought it might be real

1199.12 --> 1203.84
about you start with

1201.039 --> 1207.4
dude fauci is burrowed in to the whole

1203.84 --> 1207.3999999999999
nasty thing

1211.679 --> 1214.8400000000001
all right

1220.559 --> 1227.2
like you could say fauci is like the

1222.64 --> 1227.2
darth vader of of of the medical world

1227.44 --> 1232.88
he's so in involved in like the dark

1230.64 --> 1235.8400000000001
[ __ ] and in the power crab

1232.88 --> 1235.8400000000001
so much

1248.88 --> 1255.3600000000001
yes tara 306 i do get it

1252.799 --> 1255.36
it's just

1256.799 --> 1261.52
saying it like that isn't really gonna

1258.799 --> 1264.4
change anything right because even the

1261.52 --> 1266.4
word terrorists

1264.4 --> 1269.1200000000001
is like a state

1266.4 --> 1269.1200000000001
construct

1269.84 --> 1273.1999999999998
i mean

1271.12 --> 1275.039
anybody can call anybody terrorist it

1273.2 --> 1276.799
doesn't really matter anything it's only

1275.039 --> 1279.44
when the state

1276.799 --> 1283.36
whatever an authority declares it that's

1279.44 --> 1283.3600000000001
when it's actually a problem

1283.44 --> 1287.52
right so it's kind of pointless to start

1285.84 --> 1291.36
calling it unless

1287.52 --> 1292.48
you want to appeal to a state to declare

1291.36 --> 1295.52
that

1292.48 --> 1296.32
will they or are they still part of it

1295.52 --> 1298.48
right

1296.32 --> 1300.8799999999999
are they actually ready to declare a

1298.48 --> 1303.84
terrorist no

1300.88 --> 1306.7990000000002
i don't think almost nobody no state out

1303.84 --> 1307.6789999999999
there is ready at this point to do that

1306.799 --> 1309.84
right

1307.679 --> 1309.8400000000001
just

1312.4 --> 1319.3200000000002
he didn't die because his johnson was a

1314.88 --> 1319.3200000000002
psych bear and it's just gross

1324.96 --> 1328.13
[Music]

1365.2 --> 1369.2
he didn't die because he is an actor on

1367.84 --> 1370.32
tv

1369.2 --> 1371.8400000000001
what

1370.32 --> 1375.28
are you talking about magic johnson

1371.84 --> 1377.6789999999999
that's nonsense remember freddie mercury

1375.28 --> 1377.6789999999999
yeah

1378.24 --> 1384.0
very famous

1379.919 --> 1384.0
he got the azt he died

1387.679 --> 1393.2800000000002
so yeah oh you're on tv that that

1390.799 --> 1395.039
doesn't make you exempt

1393.28 --> 1397.44
george sanford that's a ridiculous

1395.039 --> 1397.44
notion

1398.14 --> 1401.239
[Music]

1401.6 --> 1405.52
what are you talking about tara 306

1408.559 --> 1411.36
he's not right

1412.48 --> 1418.32
unless you're still referring to

1414.799 --> 1420.72
him to his remark about fauci starting

1418.32 --> 1424.559
moderna which i didn't know but i'm not

1420.72 --> 1424.559
surprised if it if he were

1427.84 --> 1431.84
he's there to push the fear

1437.279 --> 1442.32
that's not the point

1439.2 --> 1444.799
this is not about the r the roll out of

1442.32 --> 1447.6789999999999
what was happening this is about how you

1444.799 --> 1447.679
actually get it

1447.84 --> 1452.08
all right terra 306

1449.919 --> 1455.1200000000001
yeah this is a bit of poor timing there

1452.08 --> 1455.12
but i get it

1456.72 --> 1461.44
right this is about

1459.279 --> 1463.84
how you actually get the aids that's

1461.44 --> 1463.8400000000001
fatal

1464.4 --> 1469.1200000000001
and you don't become exempt because

1466.96 --> 1471.52
you're on tv

1469.12 --> 1473.52
it's up to the person's choice like they

1471.52 --> 1476.08
weren't informed

1473.52 --> 1478.1589999999999
about how it worked if they thought oh

1476.08 --> 1480.0
let's take the aids medicine they would

1478.159 --> 1482.7990000000002
get it and die

1480.0 --> 1486.36
nobody told them

1482.799 --> 1486.36
was their choice

1487.679 --> 1493.2
right we know this now

1490.799 --> 1495.52
they didn't know it back then

1493.2 --> 1497.919
that wasn't really like public knowledge

1495.52 --> 1500.08
back then there was no internet to

1497.919 --> 1501.76
spread it around like wildfire or to

1500.08 --> 1503.12
leak a document

1501.76 --> 1506.4
right

1503.12 --> 1506.3999999999999
they didn't know it back then

1511.039 --> 1514.4
stream is like all right right no

1512.48 --> 1517.279
problem

1514.4 --> 1517.279
well not for me

1525.12 --> 1528.76
well robert digital

1556.72 --> 1561.3600000000001
now that i'm 42.

1559.039 --> 1563.52
stevie traveler that's like a really

1561.36 --> 1564.559
generic question i'm a bit weirded out

1563.52 --> 1566.96
by that

1564.559 --> 1569.52
i mean you literally know

1566.96 --> 1570.88
by your own experience that i constantly

1569.52 --> 1573.12
talk about

1570.88 --> 1575.7600000000002
my life and reflect on the past and i've

1573.12 --> 1579.1999999999998
been doing that for years and years it's

1575.76 --> 1579.2
not because i'm 42.

1579.6 --> 1583.6
although i might have started doing that

1581.2 --> 1585.8400000000001
when i was 40 i'm not sure that would be

1583.6 --> 1585.84
weird

1585.919 --> 1589.919
greatest achievement

1587.679 --> 1589.919
it's

1593.039 --> 1596.84
i don't even know

1598.24 --> 1601.84
it's all a matter of perspective

1601.919 --> 1605.279
what's my greatest achievement

1607.2 --> 1612.64
i don't really have that many

1610.32 --> 1614.48
i mean in the grand scale of things i

1612.64 --> 1617.1200000000001
think i've pretty much

1614.48 --> 1618.559
done a couple of firsts

1617.12 --> 1620.7199999999998
i've been

1618.559 --> 1622.799
a canary in the coal mine functionary

1620.72 --> 1624.799
pointing things out making people aware

1622.799 --> 1627.36
of

1624.799 --> 1629.44
of things

1627.36 --> 1631.52
i've contributed to the awakening

1629.44 --> 1634.159
perhaps even though i'm very small skill

1631.52 --> 1637.279
but i guess that more people

1634.159 --> 1637.279
do know about me

1638.48 --> 1642.96
then yeah then it's like

1640.48 --> 1646.72
officia officially registered

1642.96 --> 1646.72
so what is my greatest achievement

1651.12 --> 1654.4399999999998
i don't know

1655.12 --> 1660.2399999999998
right but hey there's still things to be

1658.0 --> 1660.24
done

1663.6 --> 1665.9189999999999
i mean

1666.32 --> 1671.2
i'm just yeah i still feel like i'm just

1669.12 --> 1675.1999999999998
getting started i really haven't

1671.2 --> 1675.2
accomplished much to be fair

1676.0 --> 1679.6
i mean i haven't just given up

1678.24 --> 1682.24
everything

1679.6 --> 1684.399
have enough i've maintained things i've

1682.24 --> 1685.84
maintained my mind

1684.399 --> 1689.12
i've maintained

1685.84 --> 1689.12
my connection with god

1694.64 --> 1699.44
i took on very strict principles

1703.039 --> 1707.84
but yeah in the grand scale of things i

1705.84 --> 1708.8799999999999
don't know i don't really feel like i've

1707.84 --> 1713.36
achieved

1708.88 --> 1713.3600000000001
anything noteworthy to be fair

1714.64 --> 1718.48
right

1715.76 --> 1720.559
no matter really what i what i can

1718.48 --> 1723.919
think up and all that i've always kind

1720.559 --> 1726.72
of felt like i'm just gonna fade away

1723.919 --> 1730.24
like a nobody in the end

1726.72 --> 1730.24
and might be for the better

1731.679 --> 1736.3990000000001
i've like seen too much

1734.64 --> 1737.279
crazy [ __ ]

1736.399 --> 1741.279
like

1737.279 --> 1741.279
in dark world and all that it's like

1742.159 --> 1748.0390000000002
my channel

1743.36 --> 1748.039
oh my channel is i guess an achievement

1753.2 --> 1758.799
but really yeah it's more like

1757.039 --> 1761.36
that's what i've been doing it's the

1758.799 --> 1763.36
proof of what i've been doing

1761.36 --> 1765.6
if the channel was taken away and let's

1763.36 --> 1769.6
hope that doesn't happen

1765.6 --> 1771.6789999999999
then i could just literally start over

1769.6 --> 1773.039
i could just continue what i'm doing and

1771.679 --> 1774.64
rebuild up

1773.039 --> 1776.32
i'd still be able to reference

1774.64 --> 1778.3200000000002
everything even though i wouldn't have

1776.32 --> 1781.48
it sitting anywhere

1778.32 --> 1781.48
the videos

1789.44 --> 1794.64
right so the channel itself is not

1791.44 --> 1795.6000000000001
really oh that's my accomplishment no

1794.64 --> 1798.3200000000002
it's

1795.6 --> 1802.0
what i've learned doing it that's more

1798.32 --> 1802.0
the accomplishment in my opinion

1807.76 --> 1813.44
the number one

1810.399 --> 1815.76
weekly saturday morning showing

1813.44 --> 1815.76
is it

1816.159 --> 1820.64
is it that flat fella i don't even know

1818.0 --> 1823.84
how many people know about me that are

1820.64 --> 1823.8400000000001
into flat earth

1827.52 --> 1832.0
i know a couple of guys but they're not

1829.679 --> 1834.3200000000002
like really fans or so they just know

1832.0 --> 1836.799
like oh yeah he's here irwin's there

1834.32 --> 1837.6789999999999
he's pretty good at the technicals

1836.799 --> 1839.12
so

1837.679 --> 1843.72
that's it

1839.12 --> 1843.7199999999998
they don't really like follow me

1851.039 --> 1856.1589999999999
right stone monkey 3d yeah that's yeah

1858.0 --> 1862.32
do i keep an archive of my videos no not

1860.88 --> 1864.48
really

1862.32 --> 1867.9189999999999
i mean i've archived some of them

1864.48 --> 1870.159
especially the flatter talks

1867.919 --> 1872.72
because they really do

1870.159 --> 1877.1200000000001
already reflect every every part of my

1872.72 --> 1879.919
lore it just it was all brand new then

1877.12 --> 1882.6399999999999
so my vernacular wasn't as perfect

1879.919 --> 1884.96
my mannerisms the way that i communicate

1882.64 --> 1889.3600000000001
wasn't that refined yet

1884.96 --> 1893.8400000000001
but it was like the early raw sprout up

1889.36 --> 1893.84
of my ideas i saved those

1896.159 --> 1899.8400000000001
but like i

1897.84 --> 1902.399
i have trouble downloading all the

1899.84 --> 1904.72
videos and i literally don't have room

1902.399 --> 1906.1589999999999
i don't have the room on my computer or

1904.72 --> 1910.0
my heart is

1906.159 --> 1910.0
it's gonna fill the entire thing up

1911.039 --> 1913.84
i mean i got

1916.96 --> 1919.96
like

1920.48 --> 1926.159
damn

1922.159 --> 1928.3200000000002
like two and a half thousand hours

1926.159 --> 1930.7990000000002
of video

1928.32 --> 1930.799
pretty much

1931.76 --> 1938.12
at least two thousand hours it's just

1934.96 --> 1938.1200000000001
a lot

1948.0 --> 1953.279
under those specific criteria you're

1949.84 --> 1953.279
number one all right

1954.159 --> 1957.279
i don't know

1955.279 --> 1959.44
are there any other

1957.279 --> 1961.6
like flat earth

1959.44 --> 1963.6000000000001
themed shows that are actually serious

1961.6 --> 1966.7199999999998
about in technical out there in the

1963.6 --> 1970.399
netherlands at all like are there any

1966.72 --> 1972.159
or is it just a bunch of popular talk

1970.399 --> 1973.4399999999998
right because that's

1972.159 --> 1975.279
what's

1973.44 --> 1976.799
happening in the netherlands the most

1975.279 --> 1978.08
it's all like

1976.799 --> 1981.399
poppy top

1978.08 --> 1981.399
being popular

1993.519 --> 1998.08
it yeah did

1995.76 --> 2001.679
i don't know any technical flat earth

1998.08 --> 2003.84
related shows in the netherlands at all

2001.679 --> 2006.5590000000002
yeah thank you guys thank you that flat

2003.84 --> 2008.9599999999998
fellow jeff gassett

2006.559 --> 2010.48
i appreciate you guys too i'm glad

2008.96 --> 2011.6000000000001
you're getting something out of what i

2010.48 --> 2013.279
do right

2011.6 --> 2014.399
because then at least it wasn't for

2013.279 --> 2016.159
nothing

2014.399 --> 2018.8799999999999
that sounds kind of

2016.159 --> 2020.0
pessimistic but that's how it poopy

2018.88 --> 2021.44
talks

2020.0 --> 2023.919
no

2021.44 --> 2023.919
no just

2025.279 --> 2028.24
poppy talk

2028.799 --> 2033.44
and yeah it can turn pretty shitty

2031.76 --> 2035.919
especially if there's like gay

2033.44 --> 2038.88
influences and that does happen a lot in

2035.919 --> 2043.3600000000001
the netherlands unfortunately

2038.88 --> 2043.3600000000001
it's a very gay country media wise

2045.679 --> 2050.0
if you sum up all the views on your all

2048.0 --> 2053.399
your videos it must be

2050.0 --> 2053.399
i don't know

2067.76 --> 2071.5200000000004
wait that's my views

2069.839 --> 2073.7599999999998
there are three or six

2071.52 --> 2076.56
my total amount of views really is there

2073.76 --> 2076.5600000000004
a number for that

2077.839 --> 2080.839
huh

2086.36 --> 2091.119
[Music]

2088.32 --> 2092.96
i don't know what it is i don't trust it

2091.119 --> 2095.839
i don't trust youtube i think that

2092.96 --> 2095.839
they've actually

2098.32 --> 2103.28
ruined me in a way like that

2101.04 --> 2105.52
like they've really narrowed me down

2103.28 --> 2108.6400000000003
there's people

2105.52 --> 2111.119
that can't even join my chat

2108.64 --> 2114.72
even though nobody's blocked they can't

2111.119 --> 2117.2000000000003
get in here they're shadow blocked

2114.72 --> 2119.68
like and that's not like hostile shadow

2117.2 --> 2121.359
blocking that's people

2119.68 --> 2123.7599999999998
that i might have gotten into a spat

2121.359 --> 2126.0789999999997
with about something and then yeah you

2123.76 --> 2127.599
know how i have my policy here i

2126.079 --> 2129.599
kick him out

2127.599 --> 2132.8
and then i might unblock him or leave

2129.599 --> 2135.28
him to the side for a while

2132.8 --> 2138.7200000000003
like with dutch yeah with the service

2135.28 --> 2141.44
day right now it was into a safari

2138.72 --> 2141.4399999999996
situation

2141.92 --> 2146.48
but yeah then youtube

2144.8 --> 2148.0
still has them blocked even though

2146.48 --> 2149.28
they're not blocked

2148.0 --> 2152.24
right so

2149.28 --> 2155.2400000000002
youtube like shadow bans people from my

2152.24 --> 2155.24
channel

2158.16 --> 2162.24
like they can't join my chat

2162.4 --> 2166.28
and that's really creepy

2177.599 --> 2181.119
belgium's health minister

2183.119 --> 2185.359
just

2190.41 --> 2198.3489999999997

2207.119 --> 2213.2000000000003
cabinet too but hey

2209.359 --> 2213.2

2403.68 --> 2408.48

2406.48 --> 2411.72
brotherly favor

2408.48 --> 2411.72

2478.64 --> 2482.64
entire thing it was a really good show

2486.0 --> 2492.44
hey but my show is good too

2488.0 --> 2492.44
i'm doing pretty well i think

2501.76 --> 2505.3590000000004
quebec's health minister

2506.72 --> 2510.3999999999996
really what does he look like

2516.72 --> 2523.0789999999997
oh that guy

2518.64 --> 2523.0789999999997
yeah come on it's not that bad

2525.76 --> 2529.76
probably is terrible but at least it's

2527.599 --> 2532.4
not a woman or something

2529.76 --> 2532.4
or gay

2535.68 --> 2540.24
or maybe it's gay i didn't want to know

2537.839 --> 2540.24
anyway

2548.48 --> 2553.2
no godzilla

2551.359 --> 2556.5989999999997
it's the same nathan you send super

2553.2 --> 2556.5989999999997
chats to

2569.04 --> 2572.319
it's spamming acronym

2570.72 --> 2574.3999999999996
you don't know the origin of the word

2572.319 --> 2578.56
spam elishi

2574.4 --> 2579.6800000000003
it's from monty python

2578.56 --> 2580.7999999999997
there's this

2579.68 --> 2583.2799999999997
scene

2580.8 --> 2586.0
in monty python's uh

2583.28 --> 2587.599
flying circus

2586.0 --> 2590.319
where it's just

2587.599 --> 2592.0
a diner and the only thing they have is

2590.319 --> 2594.8
spam

2592.0 --> 2596.64
which is like well

2594.8 --> 2599.92
spam is like this

2596.64 --> 2601.2799999999997
kind of dirty grounded up meat with msg

2599.92 --> 2602.96
in it

2601.28 --> 2605.0400000000004
yeah lunch meat

2602.96 --> 2608.7200000000003
and so the only thing they had in that

2605.04 --> 2610.48
diner is spam spam with spam spam spam

2608.72 --> 2612.9599999999996
spam spam and that's pretty much the

2610.48 --> 2615.76
scenes just saying spam spam spam spam

2612.96 --> 2618.2400000000002
spam that's really funny that's where

2615.76 --> 2621.8390000000004
the word spam came from it's actually

2618.24 --> 2621.839
from monty python's flying circus

2622.8 --> 2626.119
and it's hilarious

2637.52 --> 2641.2
like you could literally look up that

2639.359 --> 2644.0789999999997
scene

2641.2 --> 2648.1189999999997
on youtube just the spam scene

2644.079 --> 2648.119
and then you'd get it

2676.48 --> 2679.119
oh by the way thank you gorzilla for the

2678.24 --> 2682.7999999999997
five

2679.119 --> 2685.359
canadian dollar super chat donation

2682.8 --> 2689.7200000000003
yeah you sent occasional super chats to

2685.359 --> 2689.72
me as well thank you for that

2691.119 --> 2696.319
it's a tidbit you won't find on nathan's

2693.119 --> 2698.6400000000003
show elisa i disagree nathan does actu i

2696.319 --> 2700.319
think he actually we did discuss it one

2698.64 --> 2702.4
time even

2700.319 --> 2705.04
right and there's a lot of like talk

2702.4 --> 2706.88
about language

2705.04 --> 2708.079
on the flat earth debate too

2706.88 --> 2710.56
like

2708.079 --> 2712.1600000000003
integral conversation

2710.56 --> 2714.4
and it's very interesting because we

2712.16 --> 2716.24
have people from

2714.4 --> 2718.64
all over the world

2716.24 --> 2721.68
we got me from the netherlands we got

2718.64 --> 2724.0789999999997
british we got an irishman and we got

2721.68 --> 2726.0789999999997
americans so yeah we talk about the

2724.079 --> 2729.079
english language too and the origin of

2726.079 --> 2729.079
words

2740.079 --> 2744.079
you've seen that monty python sketch

2742.24 --> 2746.9599999999996
right well that is where it actually

2744.079 --> 2750.48
came from isn't that just weird

2746.96 --> 2750.48
like the word is not that old

2751.52 --> 2755.119
it's really an internet thing

2758.16 --> 2763.2
so like late 90s that's when it came

2764.079 --> 2767.2000000000003
but the

2765.2 --> 2769.4399999999996
yeah the spam scene on mont python's

2767.2 --> 2772.4399999999996
flying circus is like from the 70s or

2769.44 --> 2772.44
something

2783.44 --> 2788.16
nathan's talks revolves around that's

2785.68 --> 2790.319
only when he faces a anti-flat earther

2788.16 --> 2792.8799999999997
steamy traveler

2790.319 --> 2794.48
you know that

2792.88 --> 2797.599
which by the way is

2794.48 --> 2799.119
the show that he's gonna premiere

2797.599 --> 2803.839
because there were ballers on

2799.119 --> 2803.839
yesterday's show plenty

2804.8 --> 2810.52
so he is going to be talking about salty

2807.119 --> 2810.52
balls indeed

2826.8 --> 2829.8
she

2839.04 --> 2843.04
all right godzilla

2841.28 --> 2844.48
yeah thanks for popping by and super

2843.04 --> 2847.72
chat

2844.48 --> 2847.72
see you around

2882.48 --> 2888.8
right well yes steven traveler i know i

2885.359 --> 2891.2
know you don't like it but

2888.8 --> 2893.28
it actually really helps even the

2891.2 --> 2896.0
repetitive nature

2893.28 --> 2900.4
the mechanical details it kind of helps

2896.0 --> 2903.839
because it it chisels the info

2900.4 --> 2907.28
right it's class in a way it is class i

2903.839 --> 2907.2799999999997
go there i'm part of it

2907.599 --> 2910.7200000000003
so that

2909.119 --> 2912.6400000000003
like

2910.72 --> 2916.0789999999997
i just learn it all

2912.64 --> 2918.96
like on intuition eventually

2916.079 --> 2921.2000000000003
like pretty much my entire mechanical

2918.96 --> 2923.839
understanding of the world and even like

2921.2 --> 2925.839
how i've been able to

2923.839 --> 2927.839
figure out what might be possible the

2925.839 --> 2930.64
rectangular looping the holographic

2927.839 --> 2932.7999999999997
nature of the heavens all of that i

2930.64 --> 2934.72
couldn't have done it

2932.8 --> 2938.319
if i hadn't actually partaken in

2934.72 --> 2941.04
nathan's class and been exposed to all

2938.319 --> 2941.04
the details

2941.52 --> 2946.4
because that helped me to get a better

2943.92 --> 2948.319
overview as to what's going on

2946.4 --> 2952.079
even though some of it is repetitive

2948.319 --> 2954.24
right because complicated things

2952.079 --> 2957.8390000000004
require repetition

2954.24 --> 2957.839
for you to eventually get it

2958.72 --> 2964.0789999999997
right jeff guess it you get it so

2962.319 --> 2966.319
yeah look if you just don't really like

2964.079 --> 2970.079
the show then just

2966.319 --> 2972.4
do something else right

2970.079 --> 2975.52
but yeah you're not gonna separate me

2972.4 --> 2978.2400000000002
okay if that's somehow for whatever

2975.52 --> 2980.96
reason in your heart or mind

2978.24 --> 2982.8799999999997
not even nefariously so like you can't

2980.96 --> 2985.839
forget it i'm gonna be part of nathan's

2982.88 --> 2985.839
show

2988.0 --> 2991.0
right

3001.44 --> 3008.0
repetition is also how you brainwash

3004.64 --> 3008.0
right well that that's

3009.359 --> 3013.68
if you don't get

3011.2 --> 3015.1189999999997
your questions answered about what is

3013.68 --> 3016.8799999999997
being repeated

3015.119 --> 3018.88
right

3016.88 --> 3022.319
repetition

3018.88 --> 3025.599
without the possibility of inquiry

3022.319 --> 3026.4
is how they brainwash you

3025.599 --> 3028.8
right

3026.4 --> 3031.119
it's just saying something you can't ask

3028.8 --> 3033.599
anything about it

3031.119 --> 3036.0
or you get shamed when you bring it up

3033.599 --> 3039.2000000000003
that's how you brainwash not just

3036.0 --> 3041.76
repeating the same explanations

3039.2 --> 3043.52
and having people ask questions about it

3041.76 --> 3044.7200000000003
because they might not get a perfect

3043.52 --> 3046.72
grip at the moment they just want to

3044.72 --> 3049.2
understand it better yeah repeating

3046.72 --> 3052.0789999999997
repeating repeating is what teachers do

3049.2 --> 3053.04
teachers repeat a whole [ __ ] bunch

3052.079 --> 3054.48
guys

3053.04 --> 3057.2
all the time

3054.48 --> 3059.68
like a a regular teacher

3057.2 --> 3064.4399999999996
is basically saying the same [ __ ] over

3059.68 --> 3064.44
and over and over again every year

3070.24 --> 3075.52
or mostly right and then he might adapt

3073.28 --> 3078.079
and improvise with what's going on to

3075.52 --> 3080.559
get more popular traction or whatever

3078.079 --> 3082.88
but it is mostly just repeating the same

3080.559 --> 3085.44
[ __ ] over and over and over again that's

3082.88 --> 3085.44
what it is

3087.76 --> 3092.48
because that's how you learn

3090.24 --> 3092.4799999999996
and

3092.559 --> 3096.6400000000003
well you will have to ask questions

3094.4 --> 3098.079
right you really learn about something

3096.64 --> 3099.92
that's being repeated over and over and

3098.079 --> 3101.44
over again once you start to ask

3099.92 --> 3103.04
questions sometimes you need to have

3101.44 --> 3106.0
something repeated over and over and

3103.04 --> 3110.24
over and over again before you get the

3106.0 --> 3112.48
courage to ask a question about it

3110.24 --> 3112.4799999999996
right

3118.72 --> 3122.7999999999997
teachers bring up new ideas

3121.44 --> 3124.88
right

3122.8 --> 3127.04
well but nathan is

3124.88 --> 3130.0
technically in that sense not a teacher

3127.04 --> 3130.0
he's more like a

3130.4 --> 3133.44
well you call him again

3137.119 --> 3140.319
he's the guy

3138.559 --> 3142.7200000000003
you send the kid to when they're really

3140.319 --> 3142.72
naughty

3145.04 --> 3150.839
so yeah he is more about

3147.839 --> 3150.839
order

3154.8 --> 3159.04
and he is a student himself and even

3156.88 --> 3161.2000000000003
says this so

3159.04 --> 3163.2799999999997
yeah i am a kind of a teacher

3161.2 --> 3164.3999999999996
or i am a teacher that's what i'm trying

3163.28 --> 3167.0400000000004
to be

3164.4 --> 3172.2400000000002
nathan is not a teacher but he does

3167.04 --> 3175.92
teach he does share his info he is open

3172.24 --> 3175.9199999999996
but his focus is different

3179.359 --> 3183.04
a critic

3181.119 --> 3184.6400000000003
no that's not what i meant

3183.04 --> 3186.4
uh

3184.64 --> 3190.24
the principal

3186.4 --> 3190.2400000000002
right he's more of a principal

3193.68 --> 3198.8799999999997
right literally david weiss sends over

3197.119 --> 3201.76
anti-flat earthers that think that they

3198.88 --> 3204.7200000000003
can prove a ball for bitcoin and he

3201.76 --> 3205.6800000000003
sends them over

3204.72 --> 3208.0789999999997
right

3205.68 --> 3209.9199999999996
to the principal's office which is

3208.079 --> 3212.48
nathan

3209.92 --> 3212.48
that's right

3227.599 --> 3230.599
so

3251.119 --> 3254.88
muscle memory

3252.72 --> 3257.2799999999997
not learning now the the muscle memory

3254.88 --> 3260.2400000000002
comes after the learning

3257.28 --> 3260.2400000000002
akuma virus

3260.88 --> 3267.96
right first you have to

3263.2 --> 3267.96
find the courage or the curiosity

3268.8 --> 3272.319
well if it's just going to be something

3270.64 --> 3274.319
that said once

3272.319 --> 3276.079
then that moment might slip by and then

3274.319 --> 3278.4
you forget about it you forget it even

3276.079 --> 3280.1600000000003
exists it's only when something is being

3278.4 --> 3282.64
repeated that you can find either the

3280.16 --> 3284.0
courage or the curiosity to inquire

3282.64 --> 3285.68
that's when you connect with the

3284.0 --> 3288.16
information

3285.68 --> 3291.2
and then when

3288.16 --> 3292.8799999999997
provided for by the one teaching

3291.2 --> 3295.7599999999998
then you learn about it because then

3292.88 --> 3296.7200000000003
you're ready and then if you hang around

3295.76 --> 3298.7990000000004
you'll

3296.72 --> 3301.68
perfect that learning and that's how it

3298.799 --> 3306.119
then becomes muscle memory eventually

3301.68 --> 3306.1189999999997
that's like the second level training

3321.76 --> 3324.96
before i should get spamming

3326.24 --> 3329.4399999999996
nah

3327.68 --> 3330.96
i think

3329.44 --> 3332.799
it's

3330.96 --> 3333.76
in class

3332.799 --> 3336.16
no it

3333.76 --> 3337.2000000000003
but nathan doesn't have a class he gets

3336.16 --> 3338.0
sent

3337.2 --> 3340.48
right

3338.0 --> 3342.319
virus is taking his pants off again in

3340.48 --> 3344.559
class to demonstrate that you can leave

3342.319 --> 3346.24
your pants without taking him off

3344.559 --> 3347.52
so he gets sent to the principal's

3346.24 --> 3350.8799999999997
office

3347.52 --> 3350.88
taking off his pants again

3354.4 --> 3360.359
that's great timing there akuma virus

3356.88 --> 3360.359
thank you for that

3371.52 --> 3374.4
i think there might be a bit of a delay

3373.2 --> 3377.1189999999997
here

3374.4 --> 3380.119
between chat and what i'm saying on

3377.119 --> 3380.119
camera

3400.16 --> 3403.04
curiosity isn't

3402.16 --> 3405.2799999999997
where

3403.04 --> 3405.2799999999997
it's

3442.0 --> 3445.0
hmm

3528.079 --> 3531.079
uh

3540.799 --> 3545.839
you do tutor akuma virus really

3546.16 --> 3549.16
what

3606.799 --> 3611.28
uh all right psych bear i understand i

3609.76 --> 3613.119
think i'm gonna round out my show a

3611.28 --> 3616.559
little early

3613.119 --> 3619.119
because i kind of want to watch you do

3616.559 --> 3621.599
it's a very very long show by the way i

3619.119 --> 3623.76
think like over four hours

3621.599 --> 3627.6400000000003
might be five hours or something so it's

3623.76 --> 3627.6400000000003
gonna be pretty impressive

3628.24 --> 3632.9599999999996
nathan like really

3630.079 --> 3632.96
cut down

3633.119 --> 3638.799
some of the noise that was happening

3636.16 --> 3640.3999999999996
in the after show

3638.799 --> 3642.0
then it might be a little short but it's

3640.4 --> 3643.839
still going to be like probably a

3642.0 --> 3646.839
minimum of four hours

3643.839 --> 3646.839
right

3663.92 --> 3668.44
you're a math teacher that's cute

3673.44 --> 3678.88
all right so yeah guys i think i'm gonna

3675.76 --> 3680.4
