67.21 --> 79.44999999999999
be much appreciated so today is quite a

74.05 --> 82.69
beautiful day it's not cold well it was

79.45 --> 86.83
clear but noticed there's been a couple

82.69 --> 89.64999999999999
of chemtrails early on yeah quickly

86.83 --> 93.61
forming these clouds you can still see

89.65 --> 97.80000000000001
where it came from but yeah despite all

93.61 --> 104.13
that it seems kind of wind still and

97.8 --> 104.13
yeah it's nice see the Sun

112.16 --> 124.32
so hello everyone I got just green tea

120.9 --> 128.15
with me I haven't even had breakfast yet

124.32 --> 128.15
but that didn't come to that

128.34 --> 136.74
so yeah yesterday was pretty exciting

132.12 --> 141.6
day lots of videos again and especially

136.74 --> 145.26000000000002
Karen B's stream of David wise on with

141.6 --> 151.57999999999998
and Anthony ku Mia that was really

145.26 --> 151.57999999999998
special and yeah it was heavy stuff man

156.29 --> 161.37
David's a real workhorse man and he

159.45 --> 167.86999999999998
could sit through the through that for

161.37 --> 175.17000000000002
like an hour that was pretty amazing and

167.87 --> 177.35
yeah it just goes to show that ya

175.17 --> 184.82999999999998
remember Big Bear remember Owen Benjamin

177.35 --> 188.16
saying he had Anthony was was tested and

184.83 --> 191.16000000000003
he turned out to be to have down

188.16 --> 195.739
syndrome well that certainly did kind of

191.16 --> 199.35
show during yesterday's dream Wow and

195.739 --> 201.959
his two sidekicks were even dumber it

199.35 --> 206.13
was pretty hilarious and basic they were

201.959 --> 209.97
so basic it's like like any other ball

206.13 --> 212.519
are typical just keep on bringing down

209.97 --> 215.58
the baseline every single time wherever

212.519 --> 218.34
they go always stop start with the most

215.58 --> 221.15
basic assumptions that you can start out

218.34 --> 223.17000000000002
with the old riddled with

221.15 --> 226.44
presuppositions and all that and date

223.17 --> 229.64999999999998
they didn't even get that they didn't

226.44 --> 234.6
even understand what that was like as

229.65 --> 236.67000000000002
David was explaining very eloquently the

234.6 --> 239.37
details you could just see it on their

236.67 --> 243.7
faces they really

239.37 --> 249.849
they just didn't freakin get it dumb as

243.7 --> 253.14999999999998
a rock yeah I don't think he will wake

249.849 --> 255.39999999999998
up I think he may go along together long

253.15 --> 260.19
as it were but I don't think he just I

255.4 --> 264.82
just don't think he gets it at all

260.19 --> 267.1
so yeah sure many media people out there

264.82 --> 271.09
again if there would be some kind of

267.1 --> 273.61
official transition yeah sure they just

271.09 --> 275.46999999999997
be like oh yeah yeah oh it turns out it

273.61 --> 278.86
wasn't the poet's flood oh let me learn

275.47 --> 282.01000000000005
about that and then it'll just be the

278.86 --> 283.75
same to them because they don't get it

282.01 --> 288.07
that that was the original problem

283.75 --> 290.86
they're just going with what is what the

288.07 --> 294.07
majority is going with they think and

290.86 --> 297.16
what they have been taught they have to

294.07 --> 300.04
be told from top down that that's not

297.16 --> 302.95000000000005
working anymore and even then there's a

300.04 --> 305.47
big chance that so many ballers are just

302.95 --> 307.36
not they're just gonna go oh the

305.47 --> 312.93
government is so corrupt they've gone

307.36 --> 315.58000000000004
all flat earth if it ever comes to that

312.93 --> 318.789
and I don't I don't think so personally

315.58 --> 321.28
I think that the moon landing not having

318.789 --> 324.28
been real might at some point be

321.28 --> 327.15999999999997
declassified and because then you could

324.28 --> 330.46
quickly must or some kind of weird new

327.16 --> 333.82000000000005
attempt to do it much better much more

330.46 --> 335.85999999999996
convincing won't really be but it'll be

333.82 --> 338.229
a little bit more convincing maybe I

335.86 --> 340.45
don't know or maybe they're just gonna

338.229 --> 346.82
say now we're not gonna do that ever and

340.45 --> 349.53
I don't know but

346.82 --> 353.73
yeah that show yesterday was hilarious

349.53 --> 357.15
so it's pretty got pretty heavy Karen

353.73 --> 362.49
B's Jedi was also kind of like just

357.15 --> 367.5
throwing down pretty rough jokes and

362.49 --> 370.49
[ __ ] but yeah he deserved it he was

367.5 --> 370.49
being really dumb

377.74 --> 388.6
huh yeah let's see who is in jet so

384.37 --> 396.51
Giulio Pavan was first a GM his disciple

388.6 --> 408.61
Tom Parker Robin Stanley Matthew lingard

396.51 --> 409.36
/ Michael Ian Adams under says without

408.61 --> 413.08000000000004
question

409.36 --> 426.63
Hilton pop Tom Parker is apt happy yeah

413.08 --> 426.63
good to see you all weird morning for me

426.66 --> 432.04
like technically feel pretty good but I

429.7 --> 435.4
guess it may be a bit of an elastic

432.04 --> 437.76000000000005
effect from being somewhat weakened from

435.4 --> 441.01
what happened two days ago in a night

437.76 --> 446.86
that I just got so much energy and got

441.01 --> 449.2
really frustrated and yeah it's got a

446.86 --> 451.75
bit loud towards myself at times again

449.2 --> 453.7
and I need to be careful with that but

451.75 --> 455.98
nobody's home so I thought yeah screw it

453.7 --> 459.69
at least I'm not gonna bother my

455.98 --> 463.06
roommates with that it's very loud but I

459.69 --> 464.83
hate to be careful with my voice I'm

463.06 --> 473.82
gonna blow out my voice before this so a

464.83 --> 473.82
show had even started right

480.24 --> 484.61
[Music]

482.77 --> 486.74
all right

484.61 --> 490.37
because I don't know sometimes I just

486.74 --> 492.8
wake up in the morning and and then for

490.37 --> 496.039
some reason I just get a weird type of

492.8 --> 500.689
feel it's not like a feeling things are

496.039 --> 505.87
off and then I always remember like dark

500.689 --> 511.03900000000004
world things again from that trip and I

505.87 --> 513.2
start to realize just like at least from

511.039 --> 515.659
that moment from that perspective it

513.2 --> 521.51
seems like it's me on the other side

515.659 --> 524.6899999999999
there is basically my opponent but like

521.51 --> 528.23
he doesn't or I didn't know what to do

524.69 --> 533.1400000000001
with that and I was still with the

528.23 --> 536.029
mindset of me roughly 20 years ago and

533.14 --> 539.93
was making a mess of it I remember that

536.029 --> 543.519
I even relayed that like a year ago -

539.93 --> 548.06
when I really started talking about this

543.519 --> 551.6
it's weird and I kind of like yell at

548.06 --> 554.149
him at me from the past in the hopes

551.6 --> 558.44
that it'll somehow get through to him he

554.149 --> 561.92
was so headstrong so numb by the

558.44 --> 564.1400000000001
experience that some yeah I think like

561.92 --> 567.41
maybe if I just get really pissed off

564.14 --> 570.1899999999999
and really rough and direct then it'll

567.41 --> 572.54
somehow get through to it and it'll stop

570.19 --> 577.0600000000001
fooling around and I think that worked

572.54 --> 582.949
because yeah literally every time I

577.06 --> 585.4399999999999
remember the steps as as things grew

582.949 --> 587.6899999999999
down as me on the other side was doing

585.44 --> 591.19
less and less like really staying as

587.69 --> 594.2600000000001
passive as possible struggling with its

591.19 --> 597.589
feelings to oppose me and to halt

594.26 --> 598.04
everything I do - basically yeah ruin my

597.589 --> 600.0500000000001
life

598.04 --> 602.4399999999999
I think sometimes that maybe it may have

600.05 --> 607.55
been some kind of weird separated

602.44 --> 611.839
personification of of my self-hatred in

607.55 --> 613.91
a way that that was kind of what they

611.839 --> 616.0100000000001
did or what happened or what was the

613.91 --> 616.8299999999999
challenge I don't know it was so weird

616.01 --> 619.86
and

616.83 --> 622.529
I've never really I was so intuitive

619.86 --> 626.399
with everything I did so blindly

622.529 --> 627.93
intuitive that I literally cognitively

626.399 --> 630.42
didn't know what the hell I was doing

627.93 --> 633.329
and then ended up in a situation that

630.42 --> 635.4799999999999
was too complex for my intuition to

633.329 --> 637.6999999999999
handle yeah

635.48 --> 646.339
[Music]

637.7 --> 648.9300000000001
brush foolish arrogant very typical and

646.339 --> 651.3290000000001
well I kind of still struggle with that

648.93 --> 653.6099999999999
sometimes but it's it's weird it's like

651.329 --> 655.9499999999999
an inner monologue and every time I

653.61 --> 659.04
think like okay this what I'm doing

655.95 --> 661.95
getting old screaming at myself yeah

659.04 --> 664.529
absolutely that must look like crazy to

661.95 --> 667.2
people but I'd I'd love to explain

664.529 --> 672.26
exactly what it is because it's not just

667.2 --> 681.48
random facts it's just weird

672.26 --> 683.579
yeah yeah no get out no all right okay

681.48 --> 685.7090000000001
anyway I'll get back to Flat Earth

683.579 --> 688.05
because nobody really cares about this

685.709 --> 690.8
[ __ ] apparently all right get some

688.05 --> 690.8
feedback

696.12 --> 701.36
what are you on about

698.31 --> 701.3599999999999
[Music]

704.23 --> 710.26
oh good yeah good point cept a peep it

707.37 --> 711.67
if somebody goes to them who never be

710.26 --> 714.0699999999999
tracked yeah and then it will be

711.67 --> 715.4499999999999
definitely track that they never arrived

714.07 --> 717.5500000000001
at the apparent moon

715.45 --> 722.4100000000001
there's no touchdown on that on that

717.55 --> 724.0899999999999
visual snow approach maybe an apparent

722.41 --> 727.98
approach but there won't be a touchdown

724.09 --> 731.77
and the scale will not match up ever

727.98 --> 735.22
because nothing can get far away enough

731.77 --> 738.49
in order to appear like it would be

735.22 --> 740.11
small enough for the presumed skill that

738.49 --> 742.45
the moon is according to the

740.11 --> 745.21
heliocentric model so nothing will ever

742.45 --> 748.1800000000001
visually touch down that anyone can see

745.21 --> 758.5300000000001
from Earth ever so yeah you make a good

748.18 --> 762.6999999999999
point because yeah just a reminder okay

758.53 --> 765.16
moon is holographic it is it's not a

762.7 --> 767.2
physical object floating out there it's

765.16 --> 770.5899999999999
light and at the epicenter of that

767.2 --> 773.44
light's direction which is very specific

770.59 --> 777.0400000000001
in relation to the position of the

773.44 --> 779.71
observer on the earth we see that weird

777.04 --> 783.8199999999999
apparent moon disk phenomena with its

779.71 --> 785.59
light and dark contrast very vivid

783.82 --> 789.6400000000001
contrast there doesn't seem to be any

785.59 --> 794.22
in-between it's just lighter dark with

789.64 --> 797.29
the spots and the discoloration that

794.22 --> 797.86
doesn't really seem very shadowy it's

797.29 --> 800.65
weird

797.86 --> 804.49
moon is weird it's very weird thing very

800.65 --> 806.62
weird light phenomena all right yeah oh

804.49 --> 809.05
yeah by the way another reason why you

806.62 --> 811.15
might be a little frustrated which is

809.05 --> 813.8499999999999
also kind of entangled with things on

811.15 --> 819.37
the other side because yeah I vividly

813.85 --> 822.5500000000001
remember darker interactions with other

819.37 --> 825.28
people it's very confusing cuz sometimes

822.55 --> 828.1899999999999
I don't know if that is actually me

825.28 --> 831.64
interacting or somebody else and looking

828.19 --> 833.6800000000001
at alongside with or that it's an

831.64 --> 837.959
artificial creation

833.68 --> 840.8789999999999
I don't know have a lot of memories

837.959 --> 843.1289999999999
interacting in the Flat Earth scene and

840.879 --> 846.339
online and even getting to see some of

843.129 --> 848.23
my own bad moments in some kind of

846.339 --> 850.149
attempt to peer pressure you like oh my

848.23 --> 851.499
god if you're gonna actually do this

850.149 --> 854.41
this is what's going to result it's

851.499 --> 857.1700000000001
gonna end your life they were on the

854.41 --> 862.24
other side the creatures were literally

857.17 --> 866.2489999999999
almost like the gamma trolls which just

862.24 --> 868.99
goes to show what what type of force

866.249 --> 872.309
really does feed into all of these

868.99 --> 878.889
people online doing what they do it is

872.309 --> 881.499
in that same essence as that try to on

878.889 --> 884.11
the other side the entities that that

881.499 --> 889.779
they was that it was that frequency that

884.11 --> 893.769
is what what they did yeah demonic seem

889.779 --> 897.309
so anyway I'm I'm still a bit frustrated

893.769 --> 900.029
also from yesterday because I I quit in

897.309 --> 904.569
the middle of the show the debates twice

900.029 --> 907.449
and yeah that's been going on for a few

904.569 --> 909.9699999999999
times now in last week and I'm getting

907.449 --> 912.579
really sick of it I'm getting sick of

909.97 --> 914.86
being piled on to buy the group in order

912.579 --> 918.309
to establish some kind of stable

914.86 --> 924.639
narrative and then actually bypassing

918.309 --> 926.439
truth or extinguishing something that

924.639 --> 928.36
should not be extinguishing in the

926.439 --> 930.939
process and I'm getting really sick of

928.36 --> 935.16
it it starts to feel politicized and I'm

930.939 --> 935.16
and I'm allergic to that [ __ ]

939.55 --> 944.87
this is about again only our first one

942.83 --> 947.63
was about that stupid ozone layer thing

944.87 --> 950.03
it's always every time I get something

947.63 --> 953.15
like this they all pile on to me like

950.03 --> 955.22
I'm an arm or some stupid baller but

953.15 --> 959.9
yeah I'm right and it's hilarious

955.22 --> 961.82
because then every time rhombus actually

959.9 --> 964.22
says oh I can't believe Arwen is

961.82 --> 964.58
actually correcting this I can't believe

964.22 --> 967.49
it

964.58 --> 969.5600000000001
he says that every time that I am

967.49 --> 974.15
actually right because he's not that

969.56 --> 976.6999999999999
stupid he knows about what thing's

974.15 --> 979.1
supposed to be representing and I was

976.7 --> 982.4300000000001
talking look none of that ozone layer

979.1 --> 986.03
thing was probably real none of it

982.43 --> 988.28
or at least not caused by what presume

986.03 --> 992.18
it to be cause but it was no literal

988.28 --> 994.22
hole in the gas pressure the ozone was

992.18 --> 996.29
not missing with nothing to replace it

994.22 --> 998.03
no it is simply another gas that had

996.29 --> 1001.0
taken its place and that was the

998.03 --> 1006.0699999999999
coloration and was very obvious and I

1001.0 --> 1008.83
just got pushed and pushed and I wasn't

1006.07 --> 1010.96
I don't want to sit when I actually make

1008.83 --> 1014.11
a good point I'm not trying to undermine

1010.96 --> 1016.96
it I'm just you know I would have gone

1014.11 --> 1019.9300000000001
all the way with that if they just said

1016.96 --> 1022.5400000000001
oh yeah right it's right you're right

1019.93 --> 1024.19
Arwen yeah it isn't a literal hole they

1022.54 --> 1025.75
could just call it a hole for the

1024.19 --> 1028.27
visualization it was a dress that

1025.75 --> 1032.22
children after all mostly and don't

1028.27 --> 1034.84
people there it's one of their tricks

1032.22 --> 1037.1200000000001
but that doesn't mean that it literally

1034.84 --> 1040.03
stood for a hole in the gas pressure and

1037.12 --> 1044.6799999999998
then to just make fun of that is really

1040.03 --> 1048.34
dumb it makes everyone really dumb and I

1044.68 --> 1051.5800000000002
want to spare the panel and the debates

1048.34 --> 1054.4199999999998
for that and then I get attacked it's

1051.58 --> 1057.8799999999999
it's ridiculous makes me feel very

1054.42 --> 1061.51
unwelcome and not wanting to associate

1057.88 --> 1063.49
so I left and then after some point it

1061.51 --> 1066.58
come came back again and another point

1063.49 --> 1069.31
came up like Nathan I wasn't even gonna

1066.58 --> 1070.6599999999999
talk really but Nathan just started to

1069.31 --> 1074.95
talk about

1070.66 --> 1078.0400000000002
and like how it will split up and

1074.95 --> 1083.77
deviate and and that eventually like

1078.04 --> 1085.99
yeah how does how does that as a light

1083.77 --> 1088.69
particle actually work at such a

1085.99 --> 1091.75
distance that can't really work and

1088.69 --> 1095.47
there was like yeah well it might be

1091.75 --> 1097.06
able to work I was astounded by that

1095.47 --> 1099.6000000000001
because thought yeah that that's a

1097.06 --> 1102.97
problem for light as a as an indivisible

1099.6 --> 1107.1999999999998
unit of energy quanta that's not gonna

1102.97 --> 1109.99
work out it but if light is infinitely

1107.2 --> 1111.6100000000001
divisible in nature like a beam with a

1109.99 --> 1113.23
speed and that's all fine I don't even

1111.61 --> 1117.36
know why they drew that in question

1113.23 --> 1119.44
because light has speed its

1117.36 --> 1121.33
demonstratable I've seen it I've got

1119.44 --> 1123.16
that video downloaded on my computer

1121.33 --> 1128.77
even because it was really impressive

1123.16 --> 1130.78
direct measurement interactively so but

1128.77 --> 1132.73
if light anyway let's get let's get back

1130.78 --> 1135.3999999999999
to that point that I wanted to make then

1132.73 --> 1141.06
that yeah if light is infinitely

1135.4 --> 1144.5500000000002
divisible then no matter the size of

1141.06 --> 1148.26
something if it's extremely far away and

1144.55 --> 1153.7
it and there is enough air clarity then

1148.26 --> 1158.11
it will all split up until yeah it

1153.7 --> 1162.97
becomes very minut but still enough to

1158.11 --> 1165.52
register as a smaller version of all the

1162.97 --> 1167.32
light reflections but if it is all

1165.52 --> 1170.05
particles then it's all gonna like

1167.32 --> 1173.59
exchange it's gonna have like a

1170.05 --> 1177.1
resolution problem literally ever if

1173.59 --> 1182.1399999999999
it's in the visible units of energy it's

1177.1 --> 1183.76
gonna have it's not gonna plug properly

1182.14 --> 1187.66
we've in it's gonna get resolution

1183.76 --> 1192.19
problems like it's gonna become really

1187.66 --> 1196.39
unstable in in the image that's gonna be

1192.19 --> 1200.53
forward it won't match up but if it is

1196.39 --> 1204.0600000000002
all infinitely splittable up then it

1200.53 --> 1209.44
will always can merge down scale down

1204.06 --> 1212.1699999999998
into minut size without a problem if

1209.44 --> 1214.99
it's literal indivisible particles

1212.17 --> 1218.26
you're gonna have a problem and I love

1214.99 --> 1220.15
that I noticed that and that well I I

1218.26 --> 1222.28
one don't want to accuse Nathan of being

1220.15 --> 1224.6200000000001
a baller but he kind of did a rumpus

1222.28 --> 1229.12
thing or a conspiracy catch thing where

1224.62 --> 1231.57
you actually literally honestly put out

1229.12 --> 1234.2199999999998
the entire problem with their standpoint

1231.57 --> 1236.6499999999999
it's like yeah that's exactly what

1234.22 --> 1240.28
that's exactly what I was looking for

1236.65 --> 1242.0500000000002
that's exactly an issue yes and it

1240.28 --> 1244.81
proves my point not that light is a wave

1242.05 --> 1247.03
and they of course immediately as I

1244.81 --> 1249.55
bring something up about like the nature

1247.03 --> 1251.68
of lights like oh wait yeah I know it's

1249.55 --> 1255.3
not a freaking way so don't strawman

1251.68 --> 1261.3400000000001
with with that [ __ ] ever again please

1255.3 --> 1263.1399999999999
what made that blatantly clear but they

1261.34 --> 1265.6299999999999
were still gonna keep on nagging so I

1263.14 --> 1268.9
just left it just getting sick of this

1265.63 --> 1271.8400000000001
[ __ ] you know how is our there ain't

1268.9 --> 1274.3000000000002
gonna be any progress is this just are

1271.84 --> 1276.1
these the set things that they're gonna

1274.3 --> 1278.97
deal with they're just gonna only go

1276.1 --> 1284.1299999999999
with the particle wave duality and not

1278.97 --> 1286.81
move beyond ever not actually progress

1284.13 --> 1288.73
it really feels like gatekeeping to me I

1286.81 --> 1294.04
don't know if they do it on purpose or

1288.73 --> 1296.98
if they just can't handle more but I'm

1294.04 --> 1300.31
not getting proper responses to my

1296.98 --> 1304.98
enquiries and my attempts to clarify

1300.31 --> 1304.98
what's really going on with like

1308.45 --> 1324.24
so put that out yeah and at the same

1320.1 --> 1325.6399999999999
time like I'm not some minor player

1324.24 --> 1330.15
anymore okay

1325.64 --> 1334.95
people know who I am I am a youtuber or

1330.15 --> 1337.14
a an online person very serious with my

1334.95 --> 1341.7
own lore and my own things in my own

1337.14 --> 1347.7
style and people know who I am so I

1341.7 --> 1348.63
don't want to sit through this level for

1347.7 --> 1351.3
much longer

1348.63 --> 1354.93
but yeah where do I go who the hell is

1351.3 --> 1358.02
out there that can think on my level

1354.93 --> 1360.5700000000002
because it's it's it's great to have you

1358.02 --> 1361.86
guys I'm not saying you guys are stupid

1360.57 --> 1367.74
absolutely not

1361.86 --> 1370.4699999999998
but it's really tough to find somebody

1367.74 --> 1373.08
that can just really go there and also

1370.47 --> 1375.51
do their own thing with it

1373.08 --> 1377.97
not just ride along with me as I go

1375.51 --> 1383.37
through it I need somebody that's really

1377.97 --> 1388.17
to my level that wants to go further and

1383.37 --> 1390.6
in a way I thought that Asian would be

1388.17 --> 1394.71
one of those people because he is very

1390.6 --> 1397.8
smart but he's doing some weird things

1394.71 --> 1401.8500000000001
and I don't know what it is but he's

1397.8 --> 1406.32
been acting a little bit a little bit so

1401.85 --> 1409.1299999999999
funny but maybe he is having similar

1406.32 --> 1414.54
problems as to what I am experiencing

1409.13 --> 1418.44
that he is really wanting to unravel

1414.54 --> 1422.97
what has been kind of muffled away in in

1418.44 --> 1426.3300000000002
chemistry but he is he's trying to be

1422.97 --> 1429.8700000000001
too systematic too mechanical to to

1426.33 --> 1432.1799999999998
alternative and I think he's he's

1429.87 --> 1436.05
approaching it wrong but it's so tough

1432.18 --> 1438.51
to communicate and he is he doesn't

1436.05 --> 1440.77
really know even how to reflect what he

1438.51 --> 1442.81
discovering upon other people so he's

1440.77 --> 1445.6
just throwing things out there and then

1442.81 --> 1447.61
I properly try to respond but I'm

1445.6 --> 1449.56
encountering a lot of what he says and

1447.61 --> 1452.6499999999999
it's very frustrating to him I get it

1449.56 --> 1455.9199999999998
but I'm literally I'm not pooh-poohing

1452.65 --> 1458.14
anything I'm just being very serious so

1455.92 --> 1464.14
he's having some issues as well but I

1458.14 --> 1468.8200000000002
don't know anybody that's really capable

1464.14 --> 1473.74
and willing to to be like a more

1468.82 --> 1477.07
standard part that I could have as a

1473.74 --> 1482.97
team or whatever or a group that would

1477.07 --> 1486.97
literally go along with this this deeper

1482.97 --> 1490.8700000000001
side research as to the nature of the

1486.97 --> 1492.76
elements light in this case because I

1490.87 --> 1496.84
think that if you really get the

1492.76 --> 1499.99
defining nature's correct so much more

1496.84 --> 1502.57
of what actually works and how it works

1499.99 --> 1506.7
will start to reveal itself truth always

1502.57 --> 1512.77
the deeper truth always clarify more

1506.7 --> 1516.63
reveal more cohesion more structure like

1512.77 --> 1525.7
a fractal clearing up you just see more

1516.63 --> 1531.15
rendering like solos yeah but I am

1525.7 --> 1531.15
flying kind of solo this is my show but

1537.01 --> 1542.44
I don't know yeah I can put my thoughts

1540.01 --> 1544.89
out here but I want to talk with other

1542.44 --> 1544.89
people

1554.92 --> 1561.5900000000001
what are you talking about

1558.32 --> 1565.45
so many have left what are you talking

1561.59 --> 1565.4499999999998
about have left who's left

1568.03 --> 1574.1
the only person that I know that left

1571.19 --> 1581.72
was Patricia stare and she even came

1574.1 --> 1584.75
back I don't know anyone that's left yes

1581.72 --> 1587.45
some people have left YouTube sort of

1584.75 --> 1592.67
they gone to D life but they're still

1587.45 --> 1595.8400000000001
doing their thing so I didn't yeah

1592.67 --> 1595.8400000000001
doesn't make any sense

1602.309 --> 1609.779
all right no Skype guests would be fine

1605.909 --> 1614.1490000000001
but I really don't like to well how

1609.779 --> 1614.149
Skype is performing so far

1620.93 --> 1625.51
we his dream I ho what is that

1630.86 --> 1633.9299999999998
[Music]

1634.76 --> 1641.34
hmm anyway I'm trying to get some tips

1638.97 --> 1644.64
because yeah Karen apparently knows how

1641.34 --> 1647.9099999999999
to dual stream on both D live and

1644.64 --> 1651.24
YouTube I haven't managed to be to do

1647.91 --> 1655.71
that with YouTube or with OBS so far but

1651.24 --> 1657.72
she says a special program so yeah maybe

1655.71 --> 1660.14
I can do that that'll be cool thanks

1657.72 --> 1660.14
Karen B

1677.78 --> 1690.34
yeah no I don't want it yeah well yeah

1683.48 --> 1690.34
look this court sure but

1691.69 --> 1701.47
yeah I did not sorry about that but look

1698.68 --> 1703.9
I'm just not too eager to get discord

1701.47 --> 1706.1200000000001
involved to happen for a long time I

1703.9 --> 1709.6200000000001
don't know maybe that is hey maybe that

1706.12 --> 1712.09
is that freaking idiot on the other side

1709.62 --> 1716.1699999999998
because maybe it is a really great place

1712.09 --> 1723.6999999999998
and it should just stop printing all

1716.17 --> 1726.43
these things over mediums out there so

1723.7 --> 1729.22
but yeah I could try that already for

1726.43 --> 1731.95
had I'll first use certain servers and

1729.22 --> 1737.8
everything but also I don't know it's I

1731.95 --> 1740.8
think it's too early the early bird show

1737.8 --> 1743.3799999999999
for a panel like that but again if I do

1740.8 --> 1747.1599999999999
a night owl show in another time slot um

1743.38 --> 1754.5700000000002
I will definitely get a bigger wider

1747.16 --> 1756.73
panel involved know really well

1754.57 --> 1759.07
reasonable logic you're gonna have to

1756.73 --> 1763.32
back up that ridiculous statement or

1759.07 --> 1763.32
your band I'm gonna give you two minutes

1764.04 --> 1770.02
for the Mentalist religious stance yeah

1767.98 --> 1772.27
you're gonna get two minutes to actually

1770.02 --> 1775.69
give me a good case as to what is so

1772.27 --> 1780.87
fundamentally religious in the stance in

1775.69 --> 1784.65
the last conference or your band

1780.87 --> 1784.6499999999999
counting indeed

1802.86 --> 1811.389
[Music]

1805.57 --> 1813.639
oh oh so now it's different it's it's

1811.389 --> 1815.529
not actual content you're still calling

1813.639 --> 1818.9499999999998
it religious but religious based

1815.529 --> 1822.369
arguments how is that fundamental

1818.95 --> 1825.1290000000001
religious stance I think you don't

1822.369 --> 1829.4189999999999
really know the meaning of words that

1825.129 --> 1832.629
you're using the meaning of the words

1829.419 --> 1834.1000000000001
you're using it's so that's not good

1832.629 --> 1837.7289999999998
enough you still got a minute

1834.1 --> 1840.779
to actually give some content to

1837.729 --> 1843.279
argument as to what was so

1840.779 --> 1846.84
fundamentalist religious in the stance

1843.279 --> 1852.039
of flat-earthers in the recent

1846.84 --> 1853.4189999999999
conference it's not gonna be a

1852.039 --> 1856.799
description you're gonna have to

1853.419 --> 1856.7990000000002
actually give an example

1879.26 --> 1883.039
[Music]

1884.13 --> 1892.1100000000001
oh right okay yeah well guys yeah

1889.049 --> 1894.45
mark sergeant of course that says

1892.11 --> 1897.12
everything mark sergeant that absolutely

1894.45 --> 1897.72
proves their fundamentalist religious

1897.12 --> 1901.1299999999999
dance

1897.72 --> 1901.13
yeah yeah band

1912.08 --> 1916.1499999999999
[Music]

1928.01 --> 1933.82
oh yeah I know it's you Jason piss off

1942.95 --> 1946.1190000000001
[Music]

1946.19 --> 1949.19
Hey

1977.12 --> 1983.8799999999999
mmm well tiny womble i literally don't

1982.38 --> 1986.64
know any of those guys

1983.88 --> 1991.17
except for daniel pratt and daniel pratt

1986.64 --> 1993.0
is kind of a yeah special figure don't

1991.17 --> 1998.3400000000001
really want to associate with that

1993.0 --> 1999.96
person so yeah quite a lot of yeah you

1998.34 --> 2003.34
know what the issue is with quite a lot

1999.96 --> 2007.3400000000001
of a flat earthers as in millions

2003.34 --> 2008.81
millions of flat earthers and probably

2007.34 --> 2011.9299999999998
tens of thousands of people that

2008.81 --> 2014.6799999999998
actually do stuff online yeah some of

2011.93 --> 2017.27
them are going to be pretty unbalanced

2014.68 --> 2019.46
but that's not because they are flat

2017.27 --> 2021.8899999999999
earther that's because they are a human

2019.46 --> 2023.69
being in this era and a lot of people

2021.89 --> 2025.67
are just completely unbalanced and

2023.69 --> 2028.8500000000001
they're just improvising and fooling

2025.67 --> 2031.0700000000002
around making huge mistakes huge

2028.85 --> 2033.4699999999998
mistakes that's not because they're flat

2031.07 --> 2036.86
earthers that's because they're human

2033.47 --> 2039.8
beings in this time period yeah and

2036.86 --> 2042.6799999999998
that's not Flat Earth you know what kind

2039.8 --> 2045.98
of [ __ ] and vile vicious

2042.68 --> 2049.07
in-your-face lie behavior is generally

2045.98 --> 2052.33
now associated with ballers but you have

2049.07 --> 2056.179
no problem associated with that right

2052.33 --> 2057.7999999999997
even though it's not even a minority of

2056.179 --> 2061.429
the ballers know the real baller

2057.8 --> 2069.8300000000004
proponents seemed to be very vicious

2061.429 --> 2074.81
vicious liars yeah so that seems much

2069.83 --> 2076.909
more fundamentalist to me because if

2074.81 --> 2080.81
you're gonna be a fundamentalist if like

2076.909 --> 2083.9900000000002
winning in the method in in the belief

2080.81 --> 2087.5
is more important than anything then

2083.99 --> 2091.1899999999996
yeah well lies will there will be no

2087.5 --> 2093.409
hesitation if they think that lies are

2091.19 --> 2096.409
the solutions then they will use it and

2093.409 --> 2099.5
it is normalized in the baller community

2096.409 --> 2102.26
in the in the way of talking even it's

2099.5 --> 2106.48
introduced it's handed to them by their

2102.26 --> 2106.48
priests like this is how you fool people

2106.79 --> 2112.58
and as they are fooled so will they pass

2110.24 --> 2114.5299999999997
on the fooling because they think it is

2112.58 --> 2118.19
right because they think that being

2114.53 --> 2121.1600000000003
fooled is dissolution they don't know

2118.19 --> 2126.02
that they're being fooled though but it

2121.16 --> 2128.66
feels right and that's why they keep on

2126.02 --> 2133.42
doing it and that's how they've sunken

2128.66 --> 2138.2599999999998
into this this demon pit of Lies and

2133.42 --> 2142.91
machinations and distraction delusion

2138.26 --> 2146.03
and it's hell there in hell they don't

2142.91 --> 2150.5
really understand it because it's a huge

2146.03 --> 2151.9100000000003
mistake but it may be so huge that

2150.5 --> 2155.21
they'll never get out of it it's like

2151.91 --> 2158.72
yeah if you fall down a well it's a huge

2155.21 --> 2160.16
mistake if you step into that doesn't

2158.72 --> 2161.6
mean you're automatically going to be

2160.16 --> 2164.93
able to climb out of it

2161.6 --> 2167.5699999999997
see that's the issue it's gonna be tough

2164.93 --> 2169.0699999999997
especially if you fell deep you broke a

2167.57 --> 2172.76
leg or something yeah you're kind of

2169.07 --> 2175.73
screwed you could get out of it out of

2172.76 --> 2179.59
that huge mistake it's not a guarantee

2175.73 --> 2183.4900000000002
though you could die in that mistake

2179.59 --> 2183.4900000000002
metaphorically in this case

2188.94 --> 2199.65
yeah so yeah I'm not really too worried

2197.199 --> 2203.559
about the Flat Earth becoming

2199.65 --> 2207.279
fundamentalist religious because oh my

2203.559 --> 2209.849
god it's so religious how dare you point

2207.279 --> 2213.039
at the Bible for anything it's

2209.849 --> 2215.2490000000003
outrageous because they've been told

2213.039 --> 2219.88
that a Bible is all nonsense it was

2215.249 --> 2222.43
everybody that son on big Showzen that

2219.88 --> 2224.489
has a lot of money says it's not it's so

2222.43 --> 2228.489
it's all nonsense

2224.489 --> 2231.029
so yeah that makes us fundamentalist

2228.489 --> 2231.029
religious

2240.079 --> 2247.88
yeah Laurie you do you can think of

2244.599 --> 2250.239
yourself as not having a high priest but

2247.88 --> 2250.239
you do

2271.19 --> 2278.6
no he's not cuz your high priest right

2276.14 --> 2281.12
that's somebody you don't yell against

2278.6 --> 2283.97
you don't complain to your high priest

2281.12 --> 2287.45
no it tried to appease them

2283.97 --> 2289.58
you take the punishment you submit I

2287.45 --> 2297.74
don't do that you might have noticed

2289.58 --> 2300.67
that yesterday okay Laurie Nathan is not

2297.74 --> 2303.2299999999996
my high priest absolutely not

2300.67 --> 2307.85
and I think he's actually quite foolish

2303.23 --> 2309.98
at times unnecessarily so but I guess

2307.85 --> 2313.61
he's just not a enough as much a

2309.98 --> 2315.95
perfectionist as I am he just wants to

2313.61 --> 2319.33
do his things really good really

2315.95 --> 2322.6699999999996
eloquently like an arts like an orator

2319.33 --> 2330.11
that's what he's that's what he's doing

2322.67 --> 2332.2400000000002
I am a researcher but I am NOT a very

2330.11 --> 2334.82
technical researcher I'm a conceptual

2332.24 --> 2338.2999999999997
research I'm a theorize ER a cosmogonic

2334.82 --> 2340.76
o theorist that is what I do I talk a

2338.3 --> 2343.3100000000004
lot I think a lot I figure out things in

2340.76 --> 2346.07
the moment they don't do a lot of

2343.31 --> 2348.7999999999997
elaborate presentation about every

2346.07 --> 2351.32
freaking detail and the calculus

2348.8 --> 2354.77
involved because I'm just not that

2351.32 --> 2358.3300000000004
interested I want to know how it works I

2354.77 --> 2361.55
don't necessarily want to know exactly

2358.33 --> 2365.98
the mechanics in the detail and how I

2361.55 --> 2365.98
could replicate that not necessarily so

2366.16 --> 2371.75
because there's so much more and there's

2369.89 --> 2373.85
other people doing it and being there

2371.75 --> 2377.93
Darrow is gonna be better at it than me

2373.85 --> 2382.0099999999998
and by me not spending all my time on

2377.93 --> 2386.8399999999997
that on the one subject all my energy on

2382.01 --> 2388.94
that I may instead move along side for a

2386.84 --> 2392.15
moment with other people that have and

2388.94 --> 2395.54
then use my unique skills to certainly

2392.15 --> 2398.15
see more on top of that without having

2395.54 --> 2400.09
to dedicate everything to that single

2398.15 --> 2403.78
subject that is what I do

2400.09 --> 2403.78
that is what I can do

2406.569 --> 2413.15
it is kind of what I did with with Huey

2409.939 --> 2414.89
himself and his quantum mechanics what

2413.15 --> 2417.14
he brought to the table I figured

2414.89 --> 2418.8799999999997
something out without having to go

2417.14 --> 2423.5589999999997
through the entire study and reading

2418.88 --> 2425.929
like 500 pages of books but I got the

2423.559 --> 2428.529
preliminary and I got the explanation

2425.929 --> 2428.529
that I saw

2440.25 --> 2444.69
and then I figured out wait I don't

2442.92 --> 2448.32
think light is a particle and I even

2444.69 --> 2450.2400000000002
remember that from the past that I even

2448.32 --> 2454.9700000000003
then already saw it like what that

2450.24 --> 2454.97
doesn't make any sense I have seen the I

2455.81 --> 2460.08
think I did I must've seen it at some

2459.66 --> 2465.54
point

2460.08 --> 2468.42
I saw the that the graph that was used

2465.54 --> 2470.82
for the assumption of the light particle

2468.42 --> 2474.57
unit and it's very blatantly obvious

2470.82 --> 2480.599
from that thing that it's not a unit

2474.57 --> 2483.3590000000004
that it is divisible that it is even in

2480.599 --> 2486.0
the microscopic level it seems to be

2483.359 --> 2488.04
like a fractal but no matter how much

2486.0 --> 2492.5
you zoom in there's always gonna be like

2488.04 --> 2495.48
a gradient within the energy intensity

2492.5 --> 2497.91
so it's all gonna be bound eventually

2495.48 --> 2502.32
that's the natural conclusion I draw

2497.91 --> 2505.47
it's gonna be bound by how large the

2502.32 --> 2507.3590000000004
piece of matter is that the light can

2505.47 --> 2509.73
interact with because that's the only

2507.359 --> 2513.39
real way that we can even detect light

2509.73 --> 2515.609
is by the effect it has on material so

2513.39 --> 2520.17
it's going to be bound to the smallest

2515.609 --> 2523.0699999999997
scale of the unit of the material the

2520.17 --> 2526.41
actual indivisible unit of the material

2523.07 --> 2529.1400000000003
which I do believe that matter physical

2526.41 --> 2533.3689999999997
matter is invisible it does have a

2529.14 --> 2535.3199999999997
minimum Union at least I'm going with

2533.369 --> 2537.5
that conceptually for now it makes more

2535.32 --> 2541.0800000000004
sense but I have great doubts with light

2537.5 --> 2543.75
because it just the results don't show

2541.08 --> 2550.08
that to me my intuition just says big no

2543.75 --> 2553.41
no no there's no absolute answer come

2550.08 --> 2555.75
above that it is an indivisible unit of

2553.41 --> 2559.859
energy and that it can't exist in

2555.75 --> 2562.26
smaller fashion as what was originally

2559.859 --> 2565.92
detected in order to conclude that light

2562.26 --> 2568.13
is an indivisible unit a quanta of

2565.92 --> 2568.13
energy

2590.36 --> 2602.26
uh what what does that mean seeking star

2593.84 --> 2606.86
water tourists feel at yet oh wait okay

2602.26 --> 2608.2400000000002
Taurus field what are you saying that

2606.86 --> 2614.38
atoms are tourists feel that's

2608.24 --> 2614.3799999999997
interesting I guess it is unit at least

2615.25 --> 2620.33
no I don't even know the exact nature of

2618.17 --> 2624.32
the unit now of course we've all learned

2620.33 --> 2626.81
in school that it's protons and neutrons

2624.32 --> 2629.54
and they are like this clump the center

2626.81 --> 2631.5499999999997
and then the electrons orbit around it

2629.54 --> 2633.7599999999998
and what well that might have that

2631.55 --> 2635.9500000000003
visualization might have some

2633.76 --> 2637.88
relationship to the heliocentric

2635.95 --> 2639.6099999999997
conceptualization of our universe that's

2637.88 --> 2643.52
a lot of people suspected that I

2639.61 --> 2646.6400000000003
suspected that pretty early on but that

2643.52 --> 2650.36
does not necessarily imply that matter

2646.64 --> 2652.31
is not a minimum unit it's just that the

2650.36 --> 2655.34
way it's been represented to us may be

2652.31 --> 2663.88
slightly incorrect so maybe it is a

2655.34 --> 2663.88
torus field yes tiny Womble atoms exist

2675.17 --> 2680.349
I think you know if inertia moves okay

2682.619 --> 2688.049
could be I get it it's another way of

2686.519 --> 2692.2189999999996
approach it probably has a lot to do

2688.049 --> 2694.17
with like fundamentally building up the

2692.219 --> 2696.39
structure through magnetism and

2694.17 --> 2698.67
electricity which is kind of sensible

2696.39 --> 2700.3799999999997
for now it seems the most sensible

2698.67 --> 2702.4790000000003
course because there's a lot involved

2700.38 --> 2708.719
with those type of things so it could

2702.479 --> 2712.2189999999996
very well be not saying that it is that

2708.719 --> 2712.219
but it might be

2716.58 --> 2724.3199999999997
yeah the leaf blower it's sorry yeah

2722.49 --> 2731.0699999999997
there's a lot of leafs around here and

2724.32 --> 2737.7000000000003
it's outside it's always leaf blowers

2731.07 --> 2740.0
going around here like over there to

2737.7 --> 2740.0
church

2742.37 --> 2745.2999999999997
see

2749.81 --> 2752.81
yeah

2757.539 --> 2769.449
right well considering the atoms okay

2761.309 --> 2774.2490000000003
what gave me what was the best intuitive

2769.449 --> 2780.719
proof for me that molecules are separate

2774.249 --> 2780.7189999999996
units was again I think it was like a

2780.839 --> 2790.63
electron microscope was it that and it

2786.309 --> 2793.469
would give a a more digital of course a

2790.63 --> 2796.869
digital representation as how the

2793.469 --> 2799.569
electrons basically touched and

2796.869 --> 2804.9990000000003
reflected and that would give this very

2799.569 --> 2807.0389999999998
amazing looking surface grid of well you

2804.999 --> 2810.009
would typically interpret that as balls

2807.039 --> 2812.1690000000003
or balls being locked in together

2810.009 --> 2814.179
although it wasn't always perfectly

2812.169 --> 2816.759
symmetrical depending on what they

2814.179 --> 2819.9990000000003
showed but yeah it could be something

2816.759 --> 2823.479
else it's at least that there is a there

2819.999 --> 2826.9489999999996
is like seeming spherical units or that

2823.479 --> 2829.8089999999997
could be magnetically bound units just

2826.949 --> 2833.319
being interpreted as spherical because

2829.809 --> 2837.5190000000002
of the electron yeah the electron

2833.319 --> 2839.5589999999997
reflection but that to me was really

2837.519 --> 2842.9089999999997
something that was very impressive to me

2839.559 --> 2847.329
that did kind of convince me like okay

2842.909 --> 2849.4590000000003
well it it seems to be units it's not

2847.329 --> 2855.569
just like a fractal splitting up

2849.459 --> 2858.669
eternally they are separated units and

2855.569 --> 2861.249
I've never really seen anything that

2858.669 --> 2865.179
just completely throws that out of the

2861.249 --> 2871.93
door that is ingrained in some actual

2865.179 --> 2874.359
physical process of analyzing matter so

2871.93 --> 2877.41
but yeah matter is complicated really

2874.359 --> 2882.5789999999997
the nature of it what is it what is

2877.41 --> 2885.46
electromagnetic Tauruses or what you

2882.579 --> 2896.46
said I don't know but they do seem to be

2885.46 --> 2896.46
indivisible units I wonder sometimes if

2897.599 --> 2905.38
because I suggest that light seems to be

2901.26 --> 2907.8390000000004
infinitely divisible beams I just call

2905.38 --> 2909.869
it beams I could you could say particle

2907.839 --> 2912.819
but yeah if it's infinitely divisible

2909.869 --> 2915.1600000000003
that's kind of contradicting the

2912.819 --> 2917.02
particle the typical assumption of what

2915.16 --> 2919.24
a particle is so I'd rather than just

2917.02 --> 2923.14
call it a beam a speeding beam that's

2919.24 --> 2925.569
infinitely divisible but who knows did

2923.14 --> 2928.99
what electrons really are they are the

2925.569 --> 2935.92
smallest unit that we can apply so it

2928.99 --> 2941.1699999999996
seems to matter but my it is it really

2935.92 --> 2942.4900000000002
an indivisible unit of of negative

2941.17 --> 2945.369
potential right

2942.49 --> 2950.6189999999997
it's negative potential is it or is that

2945.369 --> 2953.38
again because of it becoming a part of

2950.619 --> 2959.38
matter that because of the matter

2953.38 --> 2963.51
relations it will make itself into a

2959.38 --> 2967.539
unit to correlate specifically with the

2963.51 --> 2971.5
yeah the indivisible nature of the

2967.539 --> 2973.9900000000002
molecule but may be separate it may

2971.5 --> 2977.799
actually be also infinitely divisible

2973.99 --> 2981.3999999999996
and just really figure realizing that

2977.799 --> 2985.0
right now it may be a similar case like

2981.4 --> 2989.26
how small can an electric pulse really

2985.0 --> 2992.38
be and how would we know it would we

2989.26 --> 2995.17
determine by its interaction with matter

2992.38 --> 2997.1800000000003
it's like okay where we're giving it

2995.17 --> 2999.549
this energy but nothing's really being

2997.18 --> 3003.1189999999997
received so I guess it's not enough to

2999.549 --> 3003.9
to do the electron thing it might be a

3003.119 --> 3012.6600000000003
similar

3003.9 --> 3013.579
KACE protons in earth how do you know

3012.66 --> 3017.339
that

3013.579 --> 3024.02
seeking star water that that seems i

3017.339 --> 3027.9
don't think so i think that that model

3024.02 --> 3031.079
which is assuming protons and negatron

3027.9 --> 3033.329
s-- also known as electrons and neutrons

3031.079 --> 3037.1090000000004
oh yeah i don't know exactly about

3033.329 --> 3040.319
neutrons but it's in there I don't know

3037.109 --> 3041.75
why protons or electrons as they are

3040.319 --> 3045.5389999999998
conceptualized would not exist

3041.75 --> 3047.91
necessarily look who knows maybe it they

3045.539 --> 3052.0490000000004
don't but there does seem to be an

3047.91 --> 3055.7889999999998
indivisible nature as to how it ties in

3052.049 --> 3059.52
to matter right that is my point

3055.789 --> 3064.099
matter seems to be invisible as a unit

3059.52 --> 3068.27
in some way while light to me seems not

3064.099 --> 3070.8900000000003
invisible in nature and electricity

3068.27 --> 3074.4
electrons presumed to be electrons may

3070.89 --> 3079.8289999999997
be the same they may also be infinitely

3074.4 --> 3081.869
divisible by the eyes I don't know how

3079.829 --> 3088.7400000000002
it was that even established how would

3081.869 --> 3090.359
you how would you find that out how

3088.74 --> 3093.5989999999997
would you figure that at the smallest

3090.359 --> 3096.569
unit probably an electron is probably

3093.599 --> 3098.9300000000003
the smallest unit that can be interacted

3096.569 --> 3101.88
with or created in some way

3098.93 --> 3105.74
how would you then determine if it is

3101.88 --> 3109.71
indivisible or infinitely divisible I

3105.74 --> 3111.569
don't even know where to start maybe

3109.71 --> 3117.9
that was the big problem in physics in

3111.569 --> 3121.19
the first place because everything we

3117.9 --> 3124.17
determine is always determined by

3121.19 --> 3128.029
comparing it reflecting it it letting it

3124.17 --> 3128.029
interact it with something else

3129.53 --> 3134.36
no that's not what I said tiny wombo

3131.9 --> 3139.54
that's not what I said

3134.36 --> 3141.77
I said yeah photons no photons wait

3139.54 --> 3145.7
photons well

3141.77 --> 3148.85
photons as a as a particle as an

3145.7 --> 3153.74
indivisible unit of quanta energy no I

3148.85 --> 3155.8399999999997
don't believe in that that makes no

3153.74 --> 3158.72
sense it doesn't make logical sense as

3155.84 --> 3161.06
to how we actually see light and how it

3158.72 --> 3166.58
seems to work over vast vast distances

3161.06 --> 3167.09
and how optics work it doesn't make any

3166.58 --> 3170.96
sense

3167.09 --> 3174.19
how can it be invisible particles and

3170.96 --> 3178.76
then just move through filter out and

3174.19 --> 3182.51
compress like a JPEG image and still be

3178.76 --> 3183.98
so representative in a small scale of

3182.51 --> 3187.13
what it was originally how can that be

3183.98 --> 3189.5
that makes no sense if it is indivisible

3187.13 --> 3192.2000000000003
particles if light because it is like

3189.5 --> 3197.68
transferring can be indivisible

3192.2 --> 3202.04
particles if it can give such a great

3197.68 --> 3203.93
skill or small-scale representation of

3202.04 --> 3212.72
something at such fast distances that

3203.93 --> 3219.5299999999997
makes no logical sense to me yeah yeah

3212.72 --> 3222.31
no sorry tiny mom I a read it wrongly it

3219.53 --> 3222.3100000000004
was a good question

3249.23 --> 3256.09
bill jina Megatron's Megatron's get it

3267.18 --> 3276.269
a proton this pro one we Nega the other

3272.069 --> 3277.829
way that's they call it electrons though

3276.269 --> 3286.0389999999998
I was thought like why didn't they just

3277.829 --> 3286.039
call it negatron alright I thought so

3289.55 --> 3292.659
[Music]

3297.64 --> 3301.81
the leaf blowers don't know

3315.67 --> 3325.21
wait is my volume extreme no why is my

3322.09 --> 3326.65
volume so alright maybe it's because I'm

3325.21 --> 3329.13
taking a little bit more distance from

3326.65 --> 3329.13
my mic

3354.19 --> 3357.19
right

3363.52 --> 3366.719
[Music]

3386.27 --> 3395.63
hmm yeah good I like this chat getting

3389.119 --> 3399.1400000000003
active we should cut off active in

3395.63 --> 3403.6400000000003
relation to subjects I was discussing

3399.14 --> 3405.29
but apparently it's not most people here

3403.64 --> 3414.74
don't really know what to do with what I

3405.29 --> 3416.7799999999997
just said I wish I could some way maybe

3414.74 --> 3420.02
I should try to get some visual

3416.78 --> 3422.8100000000004
assistance as to what I'm talking about

3420.02 --> 3425.21
here with this light being indivisible

3422.81 --> 3426.56
or being infinitely divisible in nature

3425.21 --> 3428.66
and the electron as well and the more

3426.56 --> 3433.46
like maybe I should try to build some

3428.66 --> 3435.5299999999997
visual assistance for that just to help

3433.46 --> 3437.78
clear up the point that I'm trying to

3435.53 --> 3439.73
make I think it is worth it I could do

3437.78 --> 3444.11
it it shouldn't be that difficult I can

3439.73 --> 3446.69
do it in Photoshop huh okay I should

3444.11 --> 3451.34
make a note of that because I think that

3446.69 --> 3466.429
it will be worth it okay so

3451.34 --> 3466.429
[Music]

3469.12 --> 3483.5699999999997
yeah pencil and paper I know it works

3476.59 --> 3483.57
for me that way I can click it away

3491.369 --> 3502.349
I've been wearing this for a long time

3493.38 --> 3506.579
so I see you see if I can get some

3502.349 --> 3510.619
proper light anyway hmm it's pure silver

3506.579 --> 3514.38
I carved this myself it's 99% silver

3510.619 --> 3516.4990000000003
it's a flower of life all right there

3514.38 --> 3516.4990000000003
you go

3524.67 --> 3527.84
any good servant

3549.64 --> 3557.44
look at that Kentrell yeah that's new

3565.589 --> 3570.599
yeah that's that's not a contrail people

3603.269 --> 3608.189
all right yeah guys I'm gonna run out

3605.819 --> 3615.029
the show I started a little early five

3608.189 --> 3616.529
minutes and I'm just gonna run out I I

3615.029 --> 3619.679
don't know if I'm gonna join the debate

3616.529 --> 3621.599
maybe gonna look around but I just it's

3619.679 --> 3624.059
gonna be the same [ __ ] over again if I

3621.599 --> 3627.929
don't get a proper address all of the

3624.059 --> 3629.3990000000003
situation and maybe some kind of apology

3627.929 --> 3631.619
even though it's gonna be oh but it was

3629.399 --> 3633.8689999999997
a mistake it's just missing yeah it's

3631.619 --> 3639.569
fine it happened like hundreds of times

3633.869 --> 3644.309
now over the last few years but we'll

3639.569 --> 3646.259
see what I do if I'm gonna interact a

3644.309 --> 3649.9790000000003
lot I have to do with my newspaper round

3646.259 --> 3652.829
anyway and I guess I've got to get some

3649.979 --> 3655.4089999999997
groceries also but anyway thanks

3652.829 --> 3658.6690000000003
everyone for coming I hope you enjoyed

3655.409 --> 3663.179
this show I thought it was interesting I

3658.669 --> 3664.979
certainly did I'm gonna watch it back to

3663.179 --> 3667.319
go through what I said again about the

3664.979 --> 3670.499
light nature and potential electric

3667.319 --> 3673.169
nature and all those things I thought it

3670.499 --> 3675.569
was very interesting I put it down in a

3673.169 --> 3678.989
good way in a clear way I don't I liked

3675.569 --> 3683.759
it I hope somebody else out there gives

3678.989 --> 3685.409
a [ __ ] find out eventually maybe in 10

3683.759 --> 3687.149
years all these people are gonna be like

3685.409 --> 3690.299
oh you're the one that are rich in me

3687.149 --> 3692.189
you did I don't know I don't know I'm

3690.299 --> 3697.949
certainly not getting a lot of responses

3692.189 --> 3699.839
right now but whatever so again thanks

3697.949 --> 3701.549
everyone for coming if you like to show

3699.839 --> 3704.189
then please don't forget to Rogen's up

3701.549 --> 3705.779
and if you haven't already subscribed to

3704.189 --> 3707.249
my channel and hit the bell notification

3705.779 --> 3709.229
so you know when i'm going live which is

3707.249 --> 3710.549
normally 2:00 p.m. amsterdam time every

3709.229 --> 3712.1389999999997
day and sometimes a little early

3710.549 --> 3713.329
sometimes a little late but usually just

3712.139 --> 3718.369
on time

3713.329 --> 3722.3990000000003
please also do support me please do guys

3718.369 --> 3724.0190000000002
hope you still think it's worth it see a

3722.399 --> 3726.509
lot of cash being dropped in other

3724.019 --> 3729.3889999999997
bigger channels and yeah that makes me

3726.509 --> 3731.189
jealous yeah does what I don't know I

3729.389 --> 3735.599
don't know if people think I'm worth

3731.189 --> 3739.1189999999997
that it's just me here it's not a really

3735.599 --> 3741.119
why discussion or well sometimes it is I

3739.119 --> 3744.9990000000003
got Brenda on the other day remember

3741.119 --> 3747.969
but anyway please do support me I I

3744.999 --> 3748.839
really need that I'm not out of the red

3747.969 --> 3751.359
just yet

3748.839 --> 3756.7
not for a while I don't know how long

3751.359 --> 3758.319
it's gonna last but anyway I will be

3756.7 --> 3762.43
back tomorrow is flat earth early-bird

3758.319 --> 3763.569
number 393 and I'm probably gonna join

3762.43 --> 3765.969
Flat Earth debates

3763.569 --> 3768.69
I don't know how active I'll be but I'll

3765.969 --> 3775.049
be there until the next video

3768.69 --> 3775.049
hashtag MIFA and keep it flat

3775.25 --> 3805.6
