guess hello Terry 306 first in chat good

166.239 --> 173.64000000000001
to see you doons good to see

168.92 --> 173.64
you how was my Christmas it was

174.159 --> 181.76
amazing

176.76 --> 181.76
yeah it was quite an experience to

182.04 --> 185.79899999999998
because I was actually yesterday I was

184.4 --> 189.68
like really

185.799 --> 191.48000000000002
agitated or I wasn't like feeling bad I

189.68 --> 195.44
was like just

191.48 --> 198.159
really easily agitated and

195.44 --> 200.92
like kind of hyp sort of

198.159 --> 202.599
hypertense thing going on it was

200.92 --> 204.67999999999998
difficult to deal with I got agitated

202.599 --> 207.44
quickly and

204.68 --> 210.87900000000002
well seemed like my dad was like

207.44 --> 213.0
absolutely fine with it

210.879 --> 214.79899999999998
I mean I I eventually like even like in

213.0 --> 218.72
a conversation while

214.799 --> 221.64000000000001
driving back to their

218.72 --> 224.12
home I basically just laid it down like

221.64 --> 227.92
I'm really freaking sick of this world

224.12 --> 231.31900000000002
and this life and it's was like yeah

227.92 --> 234.11999999999998
quite it's weird it's like I guess it is

231.319 --> 236.72
demoralized

234.12 --> 240.079
but it's not like I was actually giving

236.72 --> 242.599
up I was just sharing like like I I

240.079 --> 244.12
can't give it up but I'm so sick of it

242.599 --> 247.07899999999998
actually in a

244.12 --> 250.56
way it's like I'm sick of not giving up

247.079 --> 250.56
but like I'm not going to give

252.84 --> 260.56
up but yeah there was some negativity

256.639 --> 263.40000000000003
from my side but seems like they were

260.56 --> 267.44
just anticipating it

263.4 --> 268.59999999999997
almost but during the actual when I was

267.44 --> 271.919
there

268.6 --> 273.88
like we just had lots of conversations

271.919 --> 278.32
good conversations

273.88 --> 281.68
and I got to see like a bit of more of

278.32 --> 283.919
like my Stepmother's philosophy and and

281.68 --> 287.68
I'm noticing like how my dad yeah this

283.919 --> 289.96
is weird but my dad just actually is a

287.68 --> 294.32
Buddhist

289.96 --> 296.68
effectively I thought it like the way he

294.32 --> 298.59999999999997
does things it's not like who has a

296.68 --> 301.84000000000003
statue of Buddha it's not like a

298.6 --> 304.72
traditionalist but but it's like he's so

301.84 --> 308.4
bloody neutral and at times it's really

304.72 --> 311.16
annoying to me cuz he just never hops on

308.4 --> 313.96
any bandwagon ever like

311.16 --> 316.32000000000005
that even based on feelings of the

313.96 --> 319.4
moment or whatever it just doesn't do

316.32 --> 324.08
that it's kind of

319.4 --> 324.08
weird or at least he chooses not to do

324.68 --> 330.919
that but

327.639 --> 334.08
uh yeah it was it turned out to be very

330.919 --> 336.52
transformative and like even got sort of

334.08 --> 339.84
a healing from my

336.52 --> 342.96
stepmom it's very unexpected and I do

339.84 --> 346.52
feel like a lot better like a lot of

342.96 --> 346.52
that crankiness is just gone

347.199 --> 354.0
now so yeah turned into like a fantastic

350.88 --> 356.319
evening I was like really sorry to go I

354.0 --> 361.479
was like I don't want to go it's so

356.319 --> 361.47900000000004
great here it was so magical

363.08 --> 368.24
does the Indonesian Heritage make him

365.319 --> 372.68
Buddhist uh

368.24 --> 373.919
no no no his personal life experiences

372.68 --> 377.36
and

373.919 --> 381.0
choices made him do

377.36 --> 383.44
that it's pretty much because my every

381.0 --> 387.44
time my dad got caught up in any kind of

383.44 --> 387.44
bandwagon situation he would

388.4 --> 394.15999999999997
always what do you how do you say that

391.56 --> 398.919
he always end up on the

394.16 --> 401.68
bottom and at some point it's like he

398.919 --> 404.68
just started to realize that he wasn't

401.68 --> 407.56
effectively doing that he wasn't doing

404.68 --> 411.28000000000003
it leading to effective results and so

407.56 --> 411.28000000000003
he just completely

413.599 --> 420.84
changed how we like even regard social

417.0 --> 423.24
interaction itself it's weird we I'm not

420.84 --> 426.919
completely understanding it

423.24 --> 429.599
yet in a way it is a bit alien to me but

426.919 --> 431.919
less now than it was say 10 years ago

429.599 --> 434.599
when he already was doing

431.919 --> 436.15999999999997
that but I mean he did actually kind of

434.599 --> 440.15999999999997
study into

436.16 --> 443.03900000000004
it it was when he was going doing like

440.16 --> 446.319
lots of alternative medical type studies

443.039 --> 449.599
and healing things and and then he just

446.319 --> 452.0
came across that I think cuz there are

449.599 --> 454.84
definitely like Buddhists there too

452.0 --> 456.759
among those types of people that do that

454.84 --> 459.599
that did that

456.759 --> 463.72
course

459.599 --> 468.24
thing the academy is like sort of an

463.72 --> 468.24
academy and he picked it up there I

470.599 --> 475.759
think saying you wouldn't do anything on

473.52 --> 478.87899999999996
Christmas what what do you mean I

475.759 --> 481.91900000000004
wouldn't do anything on Christmas no I I

478.879 --> 485.639
always second Christmas day I go to my

481.919 --> 485.639
my dad's that's I knew

485.72 --> 493.0
that I never said I wouldn't do

489.039 --> 493.0
anything where are you getting that

493.24 --> 501.08
from it's just that I don't do like

497.039 --> 501.08
Christmas decorations and stuff

507.159 --> 511.68
really but my stepmom a

512.44 --> 519.599
lot made it into like it's like this

516.599 --> 523.279
spectacular house it's almost like the

519.599 --> 523.279
entire house is like one of those

523.44 --> 528.5200000000001
stalls it's not super Jesus themed by

526.68 --> 531.5799999999999
the way at

528.52 --> 531.5799999999999
[Music]

534.16 --> 537.76
all but it's just

538.2 --> 541.2
like

541.56 --> 548.3599999999999
the more Norse type Chris or Norse type

546.72 --> 551.88
Christmas

548.36 --> 554.12
style or Russian Christmas if you will

551.88 --> 557.24
there's like some Russian Christmas

554.12 --> 560.519
figurines too in all that it she just

557.24 --> 562.54
has her own very specific style and it's

560.519 --> 565.16
it's really

562.54 --> 567.76
[Music]

565.16 --> 570.959
magical I don't do much on Christmas

567.76 --> 573.6
yeah well besides going to my

570.959 --> 575.3199999999999
parents yeah I don't do much during

573.6 --> 578.36
Christmas that's

575.32 --> 580.6800000000001
right first Christmas day I don't really

578.36 --> 580.6800000000001
do

581.64 --> 587.36
anything and I'm always I always feel

584.76 --> 589.519
very happy if I don't get like get some

587.36 --> 592.72
nervous breakdown on the first Christmas

589.519 --> 595.079
day cuz that has sort of happened in the

592.72 --> 597.9200000000001
past because there's like nothing to do

595.079 --> 600.88
everybody's busy all clothes our our

597.92 --> 603.3199999999999
stores are clothes

600.88 --> 606.04
closed

603.32 --> 608.24
Etc but second Christmas day that's not

606.04 --> 612.8
the issue

608.24 --> 614.92
so all right anyway we're walking up to

612.8 --> 617.8
the end of the

614.92 --> 618.25
year just four more days guys can you

617.8 --> 622.889
believe

618.25 --> 622.889
[Music]

628.04 --> 631.04
it

631.079 --> 634.8389999999999
right so yeah I have no idea if Nathan's

632.88 --> 636.76
going to like do a flat Earth debates

634.839 --> 639.0790000000001
show or

636.76 --> 641.279
anything yesterday didn't because it was

639.079 --> 643.8
Boxing Day technically should probably

641.279 --> 646.2
do it but I don't know it might just be

643.8 --> 651.7199999999999
like yeah I'm just going

646.2 --> 655.6800000000001
to sleep sleep all that turkey

651.72 --> 659.72
off or something I don't

655.68 --> 663.519
know why is the 26th Boxing Day because

659.72 --> 663.519
that's what the British call

668.68 --> 674.519
it

670.6 --> 678.839
I I think it because it's

674.519 --> 680.0
like the presents for Christmas are for

678.839 --> 683.7600000000001
boxing

680.0 --> 686.0
day so it's like you have Christmas

683.76 --> 687.959
dinner you don't just open the packages

686.0 --> 690.68
or something I

687.959 --> 693.04
think just leave it and then the next

690.68 --> 695.399
day you do it and that's why it's called

693.04 --> 697.959
boxing I might get it I might have it

695.399 --> 701.48
completely wrong again

697.959 --> 704.76
it's boxing day is like a weird very

701.48 --> 708.0790000000001
British specific thing for some

704.76 --> 708.079
reason it's

708.839 --> 712.7600000000001
worldwide okay now I'm just super

711.0 --> 715.32
confused because it's definitely not

712.76 --> 715.3199999999999
Dutch

717.16 --> 720.959
teret well

734.56 --> 737.56

[Music]

998.88 --> 1005.279
great and also I got like a ton of

1002.759 --> 1006.88
supplements it was like almost

1005.279 --> 1009.079
like

1006.88 --> 1012.12
embarrassing or no it's not embarrassing

1009.079 --> 1014.92
it was just so much it was like oh are

1012.12 --> 1018.519
you sure you can miss

1014.92 --> 1020.88
that but apparently my stepmom had like

1018.519 --> 1020.88
an

1022.44 --> 1027.839
insanely financially strong

well there's like this crisis going on

1032.28 --> 1036.6399999999999
everything is more expensive and

1033.76 --> 1038.48
inflation but apparently my stepmom like

1036.64 --> 1040.5590000000002
isn't noticing

1038.48 --> 1043.0
it

1040.559 --> 1047.3999999999999
because there's people that are like

1043.0 --> 1050.6
relatively wealthy that like really

1047.4 --> 1052.52
prioritize having a visit with her to so

1050.6 --> 1056.1999999999998
she could do her

1052.52 --> 1060.08
thing like and they and they plan it

1056.2 --> 1065.2
like half a year ahead of time

1060.08 --> 1067.0
apparently like people call up in

1065.2 --> 1069.96
like

1067.0 --> 1073.2
August for an appointment in December

1069.96 --> 1076.44
really that that apparently is a thing

1073.2 --> 1079.64
and it was like swarming this year so

1076.44 --> 1081.159
she like almost didn't have like a

1079.64 --> 1085.159
minute

1081.159 --> 1087.3200000000002
break it was that busy so she yeah she

1085.159 --> 1091.0390000000002
really had like she

1087.32 --> 1093.84
scor income wise and I guess that she

1091.039 --> 1096.36
felt like hey here I have like a whole

1093.84 --> 1096.36
bag of

1096.48 --> 1102.76
supplements some of which I I already

1099.12 --> 1105.12
knew and others I yeah they're like new

1102.76 --> 1107.32
so I'm like going to try them out but

1105.12 --> 1110.32
got some

1107.32 --> 1110.32
spirulina

1110.559 --> 1115.28
some multivitamin thing but I mean these

1112.84 --> 1117.8799999999999
are like better than just like your

1115.28 --> 1121.3999999999999
regular cheap ass

1117.88 --> 1123.679
[ __ ] and my mushroom supplements I love

1121.4 --> 1125.24
those I take those regularly so it's

1123.679 --> 1129.799
always welcome there like this is saving

1125.24 --> 1133.24
me cost in that sense and Sao

1129.799 --> 1134.2
supplements and here's some weird Zin

1133.24 --> 1137.76
zinc

1134.2 --> 1139.48
complex but I mean this is like 10

1137.76 --> 1141.8799999999999
different things things this is like

1139.48 --> 1142.76
what we're going to have to figure out

1141.88 --> 1147.7600000000002
like how

1142.76 --> 1151.12
to like when I'm going to take that oh

1147.76 --> 1152.4
yeah unsurprising I got like oh here

1151.12 --> 1156.52
this is called

1152.4 --> 1157.5590000000002
relax it's like yeah our wi relax so

1156.52 --> 1161.0
this is

1157.559 --> 1163.2
not the ashwag gandai like I explained

1161.0 --> 1165.48
like yeah that did work and it probably

1163.2 --> 1168.76
helped me get off beer and everything

1165.48 --> 1172.559
but I don't I don't feel like I need it

1168.76 --> 1175.24
but like if I like get really over

1172.559 --> 1177.52
excited again I might just like okay I

1175.24 --> 1179.159
seem to be like over excited for some

1177.52 --> 1181.84
reason and it's not going to go away

1179.159 --> 1184.919
I'll take I'll try to take this then

1181.84 --> 1187.6
right of course fish oil always always

1184.919 --> 1187.6000000000001
good to have

1188.4 --> 1195.799
that oh yeah

1191.96 --> 1200.039
ax but like a newer version this is like

1195.799 --> 1203.44
bio ax

1200.039 --> 1206.4
I have no

1203.44 --> 1209.76
idea I had seen this in the

1206.4 --> 1212.3600000000001
store but it was actually more expensive

1209.76 --> 1212.36
and I don't

1213.32 --> 1218.24
know what is that that's going to make

1215.76 --> 1222.8799999999999
in the difference now of course more

1218.24 --> 1226.44
Camu vitamin C and this vitamin C

1222.88 --> 1230.159
complex which is not just vitamin C so

1226.44 --> 1230.159
this another like weird Tri

1230.52 --> 1239.0
thing so yeah I literally have like

1234.08 --> 1242.32
10 bottles of this it's a

1239.0 --> 1242.32
10 it's

1242.679 --> 1246.679
crazy and a nice Christmas

1247.11 --> 1250.1899999999998
[Music]

1251.96 --> 1258.4
cardo with

1253.76 --> 1262.8799999999999
a panther on it or what is that a

1258.4 --> 1262.88
leopard for some reason

1263.559 --> 1268.84
huh but it's a Christmas leopard it is

1266.6 --> 1271.12
holding it like Christmas decorations

1268.84 --> 1271.12
kind of

1277.12 --> 1285.32
weird I will be rattling when I

1282.0 --> 1285.32
walk what do you

1287.039 --> 1290.039
mean

1293.84 --> 1298.279
don't walk around with this bag if you

1295.84 --> 1298.279
want to

1300.12 --> 1306.0
know hello here we go again good to see

1303.159 --> 1308.919
you relax someone is selling you

1306.0 --> 1311.96
something yeah well I do have issues

1308.919 --> 1315.1200000000001
with that so yeah it's not funny it's

1311.96 --> 1319.2
just genuine and hey it's

1315.12 --> 1321.6
like sure I'd like to try I mean I'm

1319.2 --> 1324.32
kind of like open for trying supplements

1321.6 --> 1326.1589999999999
it's just they're so damn expensive and

1324.32 --> 1329.08
you can't just say oh can I just have

1326.159 --> 1332.72
one for the try yeah that doesn't work

1329.08 --> 1335.24
that way so I'm glad to be getting extra

1332.72 --> 1337.84
stuff pills yeah but it's not pills it's

1335.24 --> 1340.08
supplements all of it is actual it's

1337.84 --> 1340.08
it's

1341.08 --> 1349.96
food it's food it's effectively food

1346.96 --> 1349.96
so

1355.4 --> 1361.3200000000002
right but yeah I'm like feel very lucky

1358.799 --> 1364.6399999999999
don't have to worry about supplements as

1361.32 --> 1364.6399999999999
much now for a

1370.799 --> 1379.76
bit is veg food expensive non veg food

1376.96 --> 1383.64
what

1379.76 --> 1386.48
no no there's no like price extremities

1383.64 --> 1389.24
in that sense like yeah meat became more

1386.48 --> 1391.799
expensive but so did vegetables

1389.24 --> 1395.039
everything became more expensive

1391.799 --> 1397.84
so it's not like they're artificially

1395.039 --> 1400.039
inflating the price of something and not

1397.84 --> 1403.9189999999999
the

1400.039 --> 1406.8799999999999
rest there it so no there's no big

1403.919 --> 1408.66
growing price gap between meat and

1406.88 --> 1415.3690000000001
non-meat

1408.66 --> 1415.3690000000001

1428.64 --> 1434.3200000000002
look like a pig cuz that's people that

1432.08 --> 1436.08
like engorge themselves with bacon

1434.32 --> 1442.36
continually that's what they start to

1436.08 --> 1442.36
look like and it that's actually not a

1449.799 --> 1454.96
joke yeah you're laughing because you

1452.039 --> 1458.44
know it's true don't you

here hope to share and pass on the good

1497.24 --> 1501.799
mood

1498.36 --> 1504.36
that I do have I do feel great like my

1501.799 --> 1507.24
stepmom did a bunch of healing on me

1504.36 --> 1509.6
that and we discuss this too like I

1507.24 --> 1512.279
couldn't do that like she did something

1509.6 --> 1515.9189999999999
that you can't do with

1512.279 --> 1520.36
yourself like a certain type of touch it

1515.919 --> 1523.5590000000002
like dude she got skills

1520.36 --> 1525.84
like holy [ __ ] like you keep

1523.559 --> 1528.0
underestimate like what I do with my

1525.84 --> 1530.279
magnetization and all that stuff it's

1528.0 --> 1534.0
like oh wow I could do that stuff I'm

1530.279 --> 1536.279
like magical I'm a Healer dude I'm a

1534.0 --> 1539.76
freaking

1536.279 --> 1542.32
Noob compared to what my stepmom can do

1539.76 --> 1544.679
like I'm a Noob like she is a person

1542.32 --> 1548.76
that's like somebody's like I'm all

1544.679 --> 1548.76
crippled ah and she's just

1549.44 --> 1556.679
like and suddenly

1552.48 --> 1558.279
like whoa I feel like I suddenly got

1556.679 --> 1563.039
Reborn

1558.279 --> 1565.919
somehow like that's what she does it's

1563.039 --> 1568.96
crazy how well that worked but she did

1565.919 --> 1569.96
like I I was absolutely my mind is

1568.96 --> 1574.64
really

1569.96 --> 1574.64
blown and in a way almost literally

1574.96 --> 1581.72
because I'm used to like having sort of

1577.919 --> 1586.44
like some clout sitting here because of

1581.72 --> 1589.679
just like the activity like the

1586.44 --> 1595.0800000000002
high the high speed type of brain

1589.679 --> 1595.0800000000002
activity that I have can get a lot of

1598.679 --> 1607.24
like Sideburn stuff what are you no

1603.72 --> 1609.96
not it can get a dirty flame like a

1607.24 --> 1613.6
dirty flame out of an exhaust type of

1609.96 --> 1615.44
thing it can get like messy and

1613.6 --> 1618.4399999999998
especially around

1615.44 --> 1620.48
Christmas and she did a thing and it

1618.44 --> 1623.1200000000001
like literally like a CL it literally

1620.48 --> 1626.2
felt like a cloud just

1623.12 --> 1629.2399999999998
like completely dissipated into like

1626.2 --> 1631.44
pure blue clear sky like inside my head

1629.24 --> 1635.64
like I

1631.44 --> 1638.64
what and I could literally suddenly see

1635.64 --> 1641.96
at a higher resolution like I was

1638.64 --> 1641.96
shocked my

1642.159 --> 1648.48
eyesight like literally gained twice the

1646.399 --> 1652.36
normal resolution

1648.48 --> 1653.72
depth of what you could see so it's like

1652.36 --> 1656.4399999999998
what the

1653.72 --> 1658.72
[ __ ] like how did I

1656.44 --> 1664.76
get

1658.72 --> 1667.76
25k or 30k view out out of

1664.76 --> 1667.76
nowhere

1668.64 --> 1676.0
what now it's not as as super strong as

1673.64 --> 1678.519
as it was then but still it's like I

1676.0 --> 1680.48
it's it stay

1678.519 --> 1683.2
something really cleared

1680.48 --> 1685.3990000000001
up now it's kind of back

1683.2 --> 1688.72
to

1685.399 --> 1688.7199999999998
24K not

1693.039 --> 1698.76
30k I hope you're getting the very very

1696.039 --> 1700.559
very rough analogy that resolutions

1698.76 --> 1702.84
might not make any sense what I said

1700.559 --> 1705.36
it's like just bigger screen it just

1702.84 --> 1707.72
felt like my eyes were like a higher

1705.36 --> 1710.6789999999999
resolution bigger screen and like really

1707.72 --> 1713.88
big like something I've never seen

1710.679 --> 1717.44
before and I've seen high resolution in

1713.88 --> 1721.64
my life I've high resolution eyes and

1717.44 --> 1725.44
have a very capable brain

1721.64 --> 1725.44
part that makes that

1729.039 --> 1733.32
possible but it too apparently can get

1731.96 --> 1737.6000000000001
clogged

1733.32 --> 1740.48
up with energy Haze or just disturbance

1737.6 --> 1742.08
or whatever and function slightly less

1740.48 --> 1744.0
and that got all cleared up and it's

1742.08 --> 1747.0
like

1744.0 --> 1747.0
whoa

1750.799 --> 1758.279
jeez anyway now I did not have mushroom

1755.2 --> 1761.48
soup we did

1758.279 --> 1764.64
no there were no mushrooms involved I

1761.48 --> 1764.64
did have spinach

1764.76 --> 1771.12
though like sort of fresh spinach like

1767.64 --> 1773.3600000000001
slight like softened up the

1771.12 --> 1777.2399999999998
bit on a heating

1773.36 --> 1780.9599999999998
plate so yeah I got my spinach like as

1777.24 --> 1780.96
fresh spinach as you can

1786.36 --> 1792.1999999999998
get spinach with garlic oh that's a

1789.12 --> 1794.8799999999999
thing I guess then I did not really like

1792.2 --> 1798.76
the garlic side taste on

1794.88 --> 1801.44
it but I mean fresh spinach yeah very

1798.76 --> 1804.799
healthy so I definitely ate it I did not

1801.44 --> 1808.159
super like it though but the rest was

1804.799 --> 1813.279
amazing just

1808.159 --> 1816.5590000000002
uh black sour chicken Indonesian Style

1813.279 --> 1820.039
with rice this time and Tutti

1816.559 --> 1823.08
Frutti really good quality Tutti Frutti

1820.039 --> 1823.08
like not too sweet or

1823.12 --> 1829.32
anything and yeah that together amazing

1826.039 --> 1831.399
I and I got another portion for this

1829.32 --> 1835.84
evening so really looking forward to

1831.399 --> 1835.84
that it was delicious it was like really

1843.48 --> 1846.48
delicious

1853.36 --> 1860.1999999999998
what that's crazy darrett

1858.399 --> 1863.12
I mean

1860.2 --> 1865.88
dude can I tell you a [ __ ] freaky

1863.12 --> 1869.9189999999999
story yeah yeah yeah when I was a

1865.88 --> 1874.1200000000001
kid as a little kid I think it was like

1869.919 --> 1876.88
seven yeah in school yeah they gave me

1874.12 --> 1879.36
some performance no it's not performance

1876.88 --> 1880.3200000000002
enhancing but it was they basically gave

1879.36 --> 1882.76
me like

1880.32 --> 1885.72
LSD but it wasn't just me it was like

1882.76 --> 1890.519
the entire class of kids like a little

1885.72 --> 1893.48
drop in a in a bit of water yeah guess

1890.519 --> 1896.2
who that was yeah it was a NASA guy and

1893.48 --> 1896.2
they gave us

1898.679 --> 1901.96
LSD and

1902.32 --> 1909.72
like I think that parents did like know

1905.72 --> 1912.2
about it maybe it was really weird but

1909.72 --> 1914.3990000000001
just thinking back to that like yeah

1912.2 --> 1917.679
that's probably like when I had my first

1914.399 --> 1921.2399999999998
dose and it was like wow

1917.679 --> 1925.159
wow space and it wasn't like I was so

1921.24 --> 1927.36
amazed by it it was like yes screw what

1925.159 --> 1929.7600000000002
you're talking about you suck you don't

1927.36 --> 1931.9189999999999
know how to talk about that I was just

1929.76 --> 1935.36
seeing the stuff that I was thinking

1931.919 --> 1937.76
about being disain in my view so I was

1935.36 --> 1943.7199999999998
like whoa

1937.76 --> 1945.6
space wow man can I have some more of

1943.72 --> 1947.919
that but

1945.6 --> 1950.6
yeah it's not a exctly performance

1947.919 --> 1952.6000000000001
enhancing drugs but yeah uh I did

1950.6 --> 1957.24
experience that at school we did just

1952.6 --> 1960.6
get freaking LSD micros

1957.24 --> 1963.72
probably and I in ret I don't think my

1960.6 --> 1967.32
parents actually knew about

1963.72 --> 1969.3990000000001
that that that was even happening by the

1967.32 --> 1972.48
way I also think that there was some

1969.399 --> 1974.84
freaky [ __ ] tied in because like the

1972.48 --> 1977.84
Headmaster

1974.84 --> 1980.6789999999999
there he was involved with with that

1977.84 --> 1983.519
somehow and like he's like in jail or

1980.679 --> 1986.1200000000001
something now cuz like [ __ ] that

1983.519 --> 1987.44
happened at that school I think he might

1986.12 --> 1990.9189999999999
have even

1987.44 --> 1993.6390000000001
like grabbed some kids or something hor

1990.919 --> 1995.48
horrible thinking about that that I was

1993.639 --> 1999.12
there as a

1995.48 --> 2002.72
kid and he he was probably a

1999.12 --> 2006.1999999999998
pedo but uh yeah so yeah I got that

2002.72 --> 2008.24
experience on me oh I and the way it

2006.2 --> 2010.44
feels to me by the way because I was

2008.24 --> 2012.559
like spiritually very strong in that

2010.44 --> 2016.3200000000002
specific period it was before the

2012.559 --> 2020.24
Waldorf School

2016.32 --> 2022.84
cuz after that it did like go worse

2020.24 --> 2024.639
things went wrong but it's just also

2022.84 --> 2028.8799999999999
because I well I get got older I was

2024.639 --> 2030.84
growing up but yeah they freaking gave

2028.88 --> 2034.3200000000002
me LSD as a kid and my parents didn't

2030.84 --> 2034.32
even know about it in

2035.96 --> 2038.96
school

2041.24 --> 2043.519
for

2044.159 --> 2048.9190000000003
real how was it I don't think it was

2047.279 --> 2051.56
official I don't think they did that on

2048.919 --> 2052.7999999999997
the books duper I think they just did

2051.56 --> 2056.159
that

2052.8 --> 2059.04
secretly it was all very shady but do

2056.159 --> 2061.04
realize that like the head Master while

2059.04 --> 2063.2
that was happening who was definitely

2061.04 --> 2065.679
like involved with it like those were

2063.2 --> 2068.7999999999997
his buddies or something his buddies

2065.679 --> 2070.839
from NASA

2068.8 --> 2075.32
and he was really into that he also had

2070.839 --> 2078.2799999999997
like oh kids come like you would get an

2075.32 --> 2080.599
invitation on like an ISS viewing like I

2078.28 --> 2084.3990000000003
had this is weird by the way because

2080.599 --> 2086.639
this is before the ISS okay they they

2084.399 --> 2089.1189999999997
gave us space

2086.639 --> 2091.56
station social interactions where it's

2089.119 --> 2094.44
literally like a guy on

2091.56 --> 2097.7599999999998
wires in a station and you're talking to

2094.44 --> 2101.4
them in supposedly in space

2097.76 --> 2103.92
but this was before the ISS okay this

2101.4 --> 2108.7200000000003
was in like

2103.92 --> 2111.04
87 it is like what what thinking back to

2108.72 --> 2113.33
it it's like what wait what what the

2111.04 --> 2116.429
hell was that that's so

2113.33 --> 2116.429
[Music]

2116.72 --> 2122.8799999999997
weird so yeah but that Headmaster he got

2120.079 --> 2126.599
into a lot of trouble and it's arguably

2122.88 --> 2130.119
in jail because of pedo [ __ ] so but that

2126.599 --> 2133.56
was at that school and I just have those

2130.119 --> 2133.56
memories it was

2138.2 --> 2144.56
weird in retrospect too by the

2141.52 --> 2147.24
way all of that happening might have

2144.56 --> 2150.359
even been partially the reason what

2147.24 --> 2153.359
messed me up because before that

2150.359 --> 2156.92
specific school I did also have no it's

2153.359 --> 2159.16
not yeah I did have like a lot of hassle

2156.92 --> 2161.2400000000002
with schools even before

2159.16 --> 2163.7599999999998
that this was the first school I

2161.24 --> 2166.9599999999996
actually kind of felt at home but there

2163.76 --> 2169.88
was just some crazy [ __ ] going on there

2166.96 --> 2169.88
some shady

2174.56 --> 2180.359
[ __ ] but I mean it's also the school

2177.0 --> 2180.359
where I kissed my first

2183.96 --> 2189.56
girl like actually a real kiss and just

2187.56 --> 2192.24
kiss on the cheek or something so never

2189.56 --> 2192.24
forgetting that

2193.88 --> 2199.839
one and yeah that that was really

2197.28 --> 2203.0
important to me when I was seven I was

2199.839 --> 2206.24
like yeah I was really early on with the

2203.0 --> 2207.68
relationships man really really early on

2206.24 --> 2211.16
I was just like yeah that's what it's

2207.68 --> 2213.24
all about like why else would we be here

2211.16 --> 2214.2
other than to find love and then become

2213.24 --> 2218.68
a

2214.2 --> 2218.68
family and look where I'm at now

2223.599 --> 2228.319
I wonder sometimes if what would have

2226.44 --> 2231.319
happened if I just

2228.319 --> 2234.119
like stayed with that girl like which

2231.319 --> 2238.4
was like my first real girlfriend as a

2234.119 --> 2242.2000000000003
little kid like she did get like four

2238.4 --> 2242.2000000000003
kids and I'm kind of

2244.28 --> 2248.599
jealous peaked too early

2258.64 --> 2264.1189999999997
maybe I mean I did get like obsessed

2261.2 --> 2267.319
with sex at an absurdly young age and it

2264.119 --> 2270.48
was really nobody else's

2267.319 --> 2273.2799999999997
fault it just got to me I just became

2270.48 --> 2275.52
obsessed with that [ __ ] like at an age

2273.28 --> 2277.8390000000004
where it's really inappropriate like

2275.52 --> 2279.96
where other kids are like not really

2277.839 --> 2281.72
thinking about sex they're more thinking

2279.96 --> 2283.96
about oh I want to be a man I don't want

2281.72 --> 2286.16
to be humiliate and I was like I want to

2283.96 --> 2289.359
have sex with that girls like yeah but

2286.16 --> 2291.8799999999997
she's like eight like you are so this is

2289.359 --> 2291.88
completely

2293.68 --> 2299.1189999999997
pointless but I just wanted that

2296.599 --> 2301.6400000000003
intense togetherness and all that I just

2299.119 --> 2304.56
wanted to get really

2301.64 --> 2308.52
close but it didn't work it didn't work

2304.56 --> 2308.52
until I was 18

2315.68 --> 2318.96
anyway I'm going to turn on my

2319.2 --> 2324.8799999999997
coffee and I'll be right

2322.359 --> 2327.119
back it looks like Nathan's not having a

2324.88 --> 2328.48
live show today so I'll go on a little

2327.119 --> 2332.359
longer I

2328.48 --> 2332.359
think right be right

2332.64 --> 2338.52
back wait let me just check my

2334.599 --> 2338.52
Illuminati C on because

2338.599 --> 2341.2000000000003
it's

2365.44 --> 2368.44
cold

2393.4 --> 2398.4
and

2395.4 --> 2398.4
back

2405.2 --> 2410.7999999999997
anyway teacher in the second grade used

2407.92 --> 2415.44
to swear at you what the

2410.8 --> 2415.44
[ __ ] that's not that's

2415.839 --> 2420.96
crazy I never had any teachers that

2418.319 --> 2425.359
literally swore at

2420.96 --> 2428.52
us but some teachers would get

2425.359 --> 2430.2
mad that's by the way also an issue

2428.52 --> 2431.72
again with that school that got all

2430.2 --> 2434.8799999999997
weird with the NASA

2431.72 --> 2438.359
stuff like that head teacher also had

2434.88 --> 2440.96
anger issues like he almost like beat me

2438.359 --> 2440.96
up one

2441.119 --> 2447.6400000000003
time but then I like got to him and made

2445.28 --> 2450.119
him realize what was Happ like so he had

2447.64 --> 2453.8799999999997
like self-control issues there were all

2450.119 --> 2453.88
kinds of issues with that

2453.92 --> 2459.92
guy so yeah

2457.04 --> 2463.04
hearing much later like a decade later

2459.92 --> 2466.04
that he was in prison because of

2463.04 --> 2471.599
some touching some kid or

2466.04 --> 2474.96
whatever or Worse yeah it's not super

2471.599 --> 2476.839
surprising that guy was just

2474.96 --> 2480.16
weird and

2476.839 --> 2484.319
like thinking about it like how the hell

2480.16 --> 2486.56
does a guy like that even belong in a

2484.319 --> 2489.599
school how the hell did he end up up

2486.56 --> 2492.56
there it's weird and I don't know the

2489.599 --> 2492.56
full story of

2495.599 --> 2501.6400000000003
it

2497.52 --> 2503.4
right anyway after that school I went to

2501.64 --> 2504.8799999999997
the wal door school and then everything

2503.4 --> 2508.359
like really

2504.88 --> 2508.359
changed and I

2512.24 --> 2518.04
changed and things like got less

2515.24 --> 2520.04
liberal because they were kind of

2518.04 --> 2521.7599999999998
liberal at that school it's like yo

2520.04 --> 2526.16
Everybody's Free and you think whatever

2521.76 --> 2529.599
you want and NASA sh stuff and all that

2526.16 --> 2533.3999999999996
but Waldorf School was not like that at

2529.599 --> 2535.56
all so and it was better in a way

2533.4 --> 2538.359
because walor school also like gave me a

2535.56 --> 2538.359
challenge as a

2539.04 --> 2544.24
man and I had a lot of testing because a

2542.4 --> 2547.44
lot of annoying kids that were always

2544.24 --> 2549.319
trying to get on your nerves so I I for

2547.44 --> 2551.44
the first time I basically learned to

2549.319 --> 2555.96
deal with trolls and in this case the

2551.44 --> 2555.96
trolls were actually face to face

2557.2 --> 2562.48
yeah which is

2559.76 --> 2566.7200000000003
better because then if you go too far

2562.48 --> 2566.72
then you actually do get a punch to the

2571.04 --> 2579.24
face right but yeah I learned to deal or

2575.4 --> 2582.28
I had issues with trolls before I before

2579.24 --> 2582.2799999999997
the internet even

2584.88 --> 2587.88
existed

2600.119 --> 2607.1600000000003
anyway oh okay okay well duper that just

2604.319 --> 2609.359
sounds like it was really the the stage

2607.16 --> 2611.8799999999997
play was important to the teacher and he

2609.359 --> 2613.2
just flipped out because somebody got it

2611.88 --> 2615.599
wrong I

2613.2 --> 2618.7599999999998
mean that's probably because that person

2615.599 --> 2620.92
was just really invested in it doesn't

2618.76 --> 2624.2000000000003
seem like that's if that's just

2620.92 --> 2627.7200000000003
something that would happen at some

2624.2 --> 2627.72
time that's not

2629.96 --> 2635.079
strange it's very rare to find a teacher

2632.64 --> 2636.7599999999998
that is never ever flipped

2635.079 --> 2638.52
out

2636.76 --> 2641.4
against like a class that went

2638.52 --> 2644.28
completely aph

2641.4 --> 2648.319
[ __ ] trolling a psychological warfare

2644.28 --> 2652.8390000000004
yeah no [ __ ] yeah it was and they were

2648.319 --> 2652.839
like kind of knowingly they knew

2656.48 --> 2661.2400000000002
it and it was very sadistic too because

2659.319 --> 2663.88
they did it because they felt I was too

2661.24 --> 2667.2799999999997
comfortable it was literally because of

2663.88 --> 2673.119
my confidence that I had

2667.28 --> 2675.44
cuz I did and I do have confidence like

2673.119 --> 2678.079
inherently like nobody had to teach me

2675.44 --> 2681.16
how to have confidence I had confidence

2678.079 --> 2682.7200000000003
but then people started to destroy it

2681.16 --> 2685.359
cuz they were

2682.72 --> 2686.16
jealous didn't have a vision they did

2685.359 --> 2688.92
they

2686.16 --> 2691.3999999999996
couldn't explain a vision from the

2688.92 --> 2694.839
inside they were all just

2691.4 --> 2696.8
terrified I was not I was like trying to

2694.839 --> 2699.359
become an adult

2696.8 --> 2701.96
very early I mean hey that's the only

2699.359 --> 2704.5989999999997
way you're going to have sex isn't it

2701.96 --> 2707.359
actually act like an adult I mean yeah I

2704.599 --> 2707.3590000000004
took it very

2713.28 --> 2718.44
serious but yeah other kids I they were

2716.0 --> 2722.2
jealous they couldn't handle

2718.44 --> 2726.2400000000002
it I don't know what the hell that was I

2722.2 --> 2729.72
just wanted to like grow up and be

2726.24 --> 2732.9599999999996
competent and worthy so that I would

2729.72 --> 2736.16
have a chick that would love me and have

2732.96 --> 2739.4
my kids that was like on my mind when I

2736.16 --> 2739.3999999999996
was a pre

2741.04 --> 2746.92
te more actually as a pre-teen than it

2743.92 --> 2746.92
was on my mind as a

2747.76 --> 2756.4
teen because as a teen I just

2752.44 --> 2759.0
had like spiritualism and esoteric

2756.4 --> 2762.0
a lot on my mind that's when the world

2759.0 --> 2765.079
was like try starting to identify itself

2762.0 --> 2769.48
towards me like where I could start to

2765.079 --> 2771.7200000000003
see how things actually work and so that

2769.48 --> 2772.96
standard module of like oh I want to get

2771.72 --> 2774.64
married I want to have kids I want to

2772.96 --> 2779.079
have a wife like that kind of became

2774.64 --> 2781.16
like yeah got on the back burner it was

2779.079 --> 2785.44
still I wanted it but it's like man I

2781.16 --> 2788.7599999999998
just got it's like who I apparently I'm

2785.44 --> 2792.119
a with Wiz I I was born a wizard and

2788.76 --> 2794.119
like I'm I'm now just figuring it out so

2792.119 --> 2797.44
I was more preoccupied with that kind of

2794.119 --> 2800.44
thing in a way just the fascination of

2797.44 --> 2800.44
like perception and

2801.96 --> 2806.48
everything got RL in at school oh my God

2804.96 --> 2809.359
that's

2806.48 --> 2811.76
terrible made you feel like a robot yes

2809.359 --> 2814.2799999999997
and it's that that

2811.76 --> 2820.2400000000002
is really

2814.28 --> 2823.3190000000004
bad thank God that that that I never had

2820.24 --> 2827.0789999999997
that I was

2823.319 --> 2829.72
just like I had periods where I just was

2827.079 --> 2832.28
not really under control and I mean you

2829.72 --> 2833.9599999999996
guys are noticing it right I mean

2832.28 --> 2836.7200000000003
sometimes it just it just won't work and

2833.96 --> 2840.76
I just get so easily frustrated

2836.72 --> 2842.64
and blow out for no reason well that

2840.76 --> 2844.1600000000003
happened too when I was a very little

2842.64 --> 2845.839
kid and it just would come out of

2844.16 --> 2848.5589999999997
nowhere it's just a terrible day and

2845.839 --> 2851.24
everything goes wrong

2848.559 --> 2853.599
and and then I kind of forget about it

2851.24 --> 2856.9199999999996
and then one day I woke up and it's like

2853.599 --> 2856.92
oh wow everything's perfect

2858.44 --> 2866.559
now and people would call

2861.839 --> 2869.5589999999997
me manic depressed because of that

2866.559 --> 2872.2000000000003
effect because I could just be terrible

2869.559 --> 2876.119
and then nothing could help me out of

2872.2 --> 2877.9199999999996
that and then I would wake up and then

2876.119 --> 2879.2000000000003
it would be perfect day and then nothing

2877.92 --> 2881.64
could break my

2879.2 --> 2884.52
spirit almost

2881.64 --> 2887.0
nothing and people thought of me like oh

2884.52 --> 2890.599
he's manic depressed but it has

2887.0 --> 2890.599
absolutely nothing to do with that

2891.96 --> 2898.839
though cuz I don't like switch in the

2895.64 --> 2901.7999999999997
moment I don't have that

2898.839 --> 2903.7999999999997
real surreal back and forth of like oh

2901.8 --> 2906.76
I'm so happy and

2903.8 --> 2911.079
then that's real man depression when it

2906.76 --> 2913.8390000000004
like it switches really quickly and

2911.079 --> 2915.44
uncontrollably

2913.839 --> 2917.68
suddenly

2915.44 --> 2920.119
right

2917.68 --> 2922.3999999999996
right with me it's not like that it's

2920.119 --> 2925.6800000000003
just like no

2922.4 --> 2927.8
it's the energies I woke up with that

2925.68 --> 2932.16
day it's like

2927.8 --> 2935.92
what what did I get in the

2932.16 --> 2938.3999999999996
night and then you stick to that like I

2935.92 --> 2940.76
can't then like oh I'm going to just

2938.4 --> 2943.2400000000002
throw this day away doesn't work like

2940.76 --> 2945.96
that you have to sit with it that day

2943.24 --> 2950.1189999999997
and then when you go to

2945.96 --> 2952.7200000000003
bed then sometimes you can let it

2950.119 --> 2953.799
go and then a new type of energy comes

2952.72 --> 2956.4399999999996
the next

2953.799 --> 2958.7599999999998
day or you have to go through it a

2956.44 --> 2961.7200000000003
couple of

2958.76 --> 2967.5200000000004
times right I'm going to get my coffee

2961.72 --> 2967.52
and Illuminati C and I'll be right back

3041.31 --> 3044.69
[Music]

3048.92 --> 3057.44
all right anyway yeah sorry to hear that

3051.04 --> 3057.44
duper that you had rittling in school

3059.359 --> 3065.04
and it feels

3061.24 --> 3068.2799999999997
typical cuz you have that thingy and

3065.04 --> 3070.64
people get annoyed by it and and in the

3068.28 --> 3073.3190000000004
past they then gave you riddling because

3070.64 --> 3077.44
of that instead of just realizing hey

3073.319 --> 3079.2799999999997
this kid just needs a little bit extra

3077.44 --> 3082.68
attention to

3079.28 --> 3084.7200000000003
like get through this this mind of his

3082.68 --> 3087.359
because I do think you actually do have

3084.72 --> 3087.359
like a very

3087.68 --> 3090.2
active

3091.559 --> 3098.92
mind like

3094.079 --> 3101.4
myself and I specifically didn't get

3098.92 --> 3103.96
rlin even though some people really

3101.4 --> 3107.28
wanted me to have that but like my

3103.96 --> 3109.7200000000003
parents fought against that and I didn't

3107.28 --> 3109.7200000000003
want it

3110.76 --> 3114.3590000000004
either I I don't think I even like tried

3113.4 --> 3117.28
it

3114.359 --> 3121.5589999999997
once

3117.28 --> 3122.88
but it's just like no I felt like I I I

3121.559 --> 3126.079
can't

3122.88 --> 3128.7200000000003
disrupt what I'm doing like internally

3126.079 --> 3130.6800000000003
the questioning and and like testing

3128.72 --> 3132.9599999999996
things because it was all part of like

3130.68 --> 3135.8799999999997
I'm just testing how everything

3132.96 --> 3137.92
works and to test how everything works

3135.88 --> 3139.28
you actually have to get on the nerves

3137.92 --> 3141.44
of

3139.28 --> 3144.6400000000003
people because you're testing them you

3141.44 --> 3146.799
test how they work so you have to get on

3144.64 --> 3149.5989999999997
the nerves otherwise you don't test

3146.799 --> 3151.48
anything nothing changes you have to get

3149.599 --> 3153.28
the things you have to be inconvenient

3151.48 --> 3156.88
you have to do it in the wrong moment

3153.28 --> 3158.7200000000003
because you're testing how people work

3156.88 --> 3162.28
that's what I was

3158.72 --> 3164.3999999999996
doing and then eventually like you find

3162.28 --> 3168.1600000000003
a balance with that it's like okay you

3164.4 --> 3171.52
can't always just maximum annoy people

3168.16 --> 3171.52
like at some point it's got to

3172.2 --> 3179.799
end right and yeah at the Waldorf school

3176.44 --> 3182.44
they did have people like me and others

3179.799 --> 3185.24
and we were against Rin like there were

3182.44 --> 3188.44
no rlin takers on that school they were

3185.24 --> 3193.359
all like really against that against any

3188.44 --> 3196.599
drugs any all drugs or any

3193.359 --> 3198.88
form like no I don't think they were

3196.599 --> 3202.079
even like I think they were like even

3198.88 --> 3204.6400000000003
against aspirin taking that for a

3202.079 --> 3207.1600000000003
headache I'm not 100% sure there might

3204.64 --> 3207.16
be exception

3208.2 --> 3214.24
but yeah no

3210.119 --> 3219.0
rling and so there were just good very

3214.24 --> 3222.72
brilliant and wise and absurdly patient

3219.0 --> 3225.2
teachers that would just let you be that

3222.72 --> 3227.04
way and test each other and so we would

3225.2 --> 3229.68
all test each other and so the kids will

3227.04 --> 3232.64
test me and I test them and they were my

3229.68 --> 3234.839
trolls eventually because I just never

3232.64 --> 3237.359
stopped it was like yeah I'm going to

3234.839 --> 3240.04
make it 20 year career out of doing this

3237.359 --> 3242.7599999999998
that's what it what felt like to me of

3240.04 --> 3245.7599999999998
course absurd being a

3242.76 --> 3245.76
kid

3245.839 --> 3251.119
and and even back then I had really

3248.96 --> 3254.4
weird Vision

3251.119 --> 3256.0
[ __ ] Vision

3254.4 --> 3260.359
stuff

3256.0 --> 3264.079
where I think my guides would tell me

3260.359 --> 3267.0
like this is exactly what you'll be

3264.079 --> 3270.799
doing in the

3267.0 --> 3273.839
future continual hassle continual

3270.799 --> 3278.04
ruffling feathers continually never

3273.839 --> 3281.72
ending and it's like people need that

3278.04 --> 3283.92
and like yeah now don't try to make any

3281.72 --> 3285.9199999999996
sense of it it's just that's just what

3283.92 --> 3288.16
it is it's like God just telling you

3285.92 --> 3290.839
yeah this is just what it is

3288.16 --> 3292.72
and yeah too bad if it doesn't make any

3290.839 --> 3295.16
damn sense to you this is what you got

3292.72 --> 3298.319
to do you just don't understand

3295.16 --> 3298.319
understand why it's important

3303.839 --> 3309.599
yet so yeah for

3307.0 --> 3313.96
me this is I think I might have said

3309.599 --> 3313.96
this before but getting into Flat Earth

3314.04 --> 3322.68
2015 in a way it is a spiritual

3319.119 --> 3325.2000000000003
continuation of my walor school

3322.68 --> 3328.0
experience that I had with those kids

3325.2 --> 3331.2
was always get on my neck and I was

3328.0 --> 3332.839
always like I'm going to in the class in

3331.2 --> 3335.1189999999997
front of everybody and everybody like

3332.839 --> 3337.319
all gamma testing you oh he going to

3335.119 --> 3341.48
[ __ ] up is he going to be embarrassed

3337.319 --> 3343.079
and I would like do like full honored

3341.48 --> 3347.4
and power

3343.079 --> 3350.3590000000004
empowered speech like things too like I

3347.4 --> 3354.319
would defy all of those trolls in the

3350.359 --> 3356.4
class and like and do it almost with a

3354.319 --> 3359.319
quality that's from the future with a

3356.4 --> 3362.92
quality of like how I do things

3359.319 --> 3365.72
now but I do it as a very little kid and

3362.92 --> 3367.6800000000003
like that broke everybody's mind it's

3365.72 --> 3369.0389999999998
like how is that possible how can a

3367.68 --> 3372.0389999999998
little kid do

3369.039 --> 3374.0
that how where did you get that wisdom

3372.039 --> 3376.6800000000003
where did you get that where do you get

3374.0 --> 3378.359
it from it's out of nowhere it's like

3376.68 --> 3380.16
that your parents didn't teach you that

3378.359 --> 3382.68
and they didn't like where do you get

3380.16 --> 3383.92
that information from I I got it from

3382.68 --> 3386.0
the

3383.92 --> 3388.92
future

3386.0 --> 3388.92
I saw it in a

3393.599 --> 3401.559
vision yeah but they did like it

3397.839 --> 3404.7599999999998
much especially the vision stuff they

3401.559 --> 3404.76
were all very scared of

3407.119 --> 3412.76
it there were some of those kids that

3409.559 --> 3414.92
said that that was literally the devil

3412.76 --> 3416.559
that the devil that I had a contract

3414.92 --> 3418.52
with the devil and that's how I got the

3416.559 --> 3421.039
Visions that's what they would tell

3418.52 --> 3423.68
me and I didn't

3421.039 --> 3426.28
know I mean I've actually considered

3423.68 --> 3427.799
whether that might be true or not but I

3426.28 --> 3431.119
mean you can't do a contract with the

3427.799 --> 3431.119
devil when you're freaking

3431.64 --> 3438.44
seven but I didn't know what that all

3434.319 --> 3442.319
was I mean it was also the black bearded

3438.44 --> 3446.0
man the black robe black bearded man he

3442.319 --> 3449.52
was also there and he would it's part of

3446.0 --> 3452.0
that it's just I never know in a way

3449.52 --> 3455.24
I've like I'm I don't know if I'll ever

3452.0 --> 3459.16
be capable of figuring out

3455.24 --> 3460.5589999999997
who the black bearded black robed man

3459.16 --> 3463.3999999999996
really

3460.559 --> 3465.88
was throughout my vision like I can

3463.4 --> 3471.64
never be sure it seemed like he was a

3465.88 --> 3478.88
representative or a symbol of God the

3471.64 --> 3482.24
Creator but also not very not you would

3478.88 --> 3485.48
seem to just display

3482.24 --> 3489.2799999999997
like very Earthly things that you

3485.48 --> 3493.119
definitely wouldn't associate with a

3489.28 --> 3497.039
symbol representative of God and that

3493.119 --> 3499.48
made it all very very mysterious and

3497.039 --> 3504.1600000000003
strange to me and it still is it's like

3499.48 --> 3505.48
I'm it's 40 years later or 38 years

3504.16 --> 3509.8799999999997
later

3505.48 --> 3509.88
since I first saw yeah first time was

3510.88 --> 3518.119
five it's first time I saw black bearded

3514.0 --> 3518.119
black robe man with my mother

3519.4 --> 3527.88
there like click other side of the

3523.599 --> 3530.599
reality the same room other place man

3527.88 --> 3530.599
that man was

3532.799 --> 3539.319
there I can't tell whether that man was

3536.48 --> 3542.72
act had actually been physically there

3539.319 --> 3545.92
in our house where that was taking place

3542.72 --> 3547.2
I can't tell I don't know I can't ask my

3545.92 --> 3549.64
mother

3547.2 --> 3551.24
either sometimes I feel really sorry

3549.64 --> 3554.0
that she's gone

3551.24 --> 3555.7599999999998
because I have so many questions about

3554.0 --> 3558.92
these things that were happening back

3555.76 --> 3561.8390000000004
then and my dad wasn't really involved

3558.92 --> 3565.119
my dad back then was kind of retreated

3561.839 --> 3567.92
he was like going through his own thing

3565.119 --> 3571.48
his own ego struggle

3567.92 --> 3574.64
thing and he was like mostly doing it in

3571.48 --> 3576.68
private so my mother was more involved

3574.64 --> 3579.1189999999997
with all these kinds of things spiritual

3576.68 --> 3583.24
things including when I was

3579.119 --> 3585.96
younger and she witnessed a lot of that

3583.24 --> 3590.359
stuff and she's gone and I can't ask her

3585.96 --> 3590.359
about it and I feel really

3591.039 --> 3596.0
sad cuz there are so many things I want

3593.48 --> 3599.88
to ask like what what was it then do you

3596.0 --> 3603.0
remember this how was how did you see

3599.88 --> 3605.359
it now that I'm older and I have finally

3603.0 --> 3607.44
have the ears to actually listen to what

3605.359 --> 3610.16
you have to say about such things but

3607.44 --> 3610.16
she's not there

3615.69 --> 3620.52
[Music]

3617.44 --> 3620.52
anymore all

3623.559 --> 3626.559
right

3627.8 --> 3631.699
[Music]

3642.599 --> 3646.92
hey price of Adam by the way good to see

3644.24 --> 3650.9599999999996
you don't see you around my chat that

3646.92 --> 3650.96
much anymore glad to see

3653.52 --> 3656.52
you

3659.799 --> 3664.0389999999998
speed up your body to match your mind

3662.16 --> 3667.44
well yeah price of Adam well the big

3664.039 --> 3668.7990000000004
trick is your mind's going to be Speedy

3667.44 --> 3672.2000000000003
how do you

3668.799 --> 3674.7599999999998
not over compensate by slowing your body

3672.2 --> 3678.0389999999998
down it's like because there's like two

3674.76 --> 3680.1600000000003
components your mind always fast body

3678.039 --> 3683.119
can have different

3680.16 --> 3685.2799999999997
settings if you match it you just get

3683.119 --> 3688.92
really electrified and then eventually

3685.28 --> 3692.8390000000004
it'll Tire even your mind

3688.92 --> 3695.28
down but if you want to stop it then

3692.839 --> 3697.48
what might happen is that you really

3695.28 --> 3699.559
slow your body down so that like all the

3697.48 --> 3702.079
energy just goes to your

3699.559 --> 3704.28
mind I used to have that issue a little

3702.079 --> 3704.28
bit

3708.72 --> 3713.319
too

3710.359 --> 3717.319
and the only real way to slow down your

3713.319 --> 3719.68
mind is to actually do physical things

3717.319 --> 3719.68
like

3719.839 --> 3726.359
sporting doing something sportive that

3723.2 --> 3728.64
really helps against over overactive

3726.359 --> 3730.5989999999997
Minds

3728.64 --> 3734.1189999999997
because it

3730.599 --> 3736.7200000000003
just it introduces also and this is

3734.119 --> 3738.96
proven different type of hormones and

3736.72 --> 3741.48
things when you do that sort of like

3738.96 --> 3745.96
workout physical workout and that kind

3741.48 --> 3749.279
of just transforms how your

3745.96 --> 3752.7200000000003
mental processes start to manifest so

3749.279 --> 3754.44
your it literally changes your mind if

3752.72 --> 3757.319
you do more

3754.44 --> 3759.039
Sports than if you never do any sports

3757.319 --> 3761.599
and you're always just cerebrally

3759.039 --> 3762.7200000000003
thinking but then it's like it becomes

3761.599 --> 3765.6800000000003
too

3762.72 --> 3767.3999999999996
isolated you need to Earth it down and

3765.68 --> 3770.0
the way to do it is to

3767.4 --> 3772.599
do sportive

3770.0 --> 3775.68
activity to get the blood flowing to get

3772.599 --> 3777.319
your muscles moving to get it all moving

3775.68 --> 3779.96
around

3777.319 --> 3782.119
and do it with Focus right I mean

3779.96 --> 3784.48
sporting is not just I'm going to just

3782.119 --> 3787.4
move around no no no you have to give

3784.48 --> 3790.16
your concentration your focus on what is

3787.4 --> 3793.319
happening in your body you have to do it

3790.16 --> 3796.5589999999997
actively with your mind

3793.319 --> 3799.319
right it's not just moving around and

3796.559 --> 3802.96
doing that it

3799.319 --> 3806.279
helps stabilize your mind if you are if

3802.96 --> 3806.279
you have hyperactivity

3817.96 --> 3824.52
and yeah taking rlin it just it it

3820.799 --> 3829.119
doesn't help you build this trick this

3824.52 --> 3832.839
discipline right to just naturally

3829.119 --> 3834.44
accommodate for this thing you have what

3832.839 --> 3837.599
you're going to take drugs well when you

3834.44 --> 3841.0
take drugs you're not going to build to

3837.599 --> 3844.52
accommodate for this thing you

3841.0 --> 3846.68
have you're just drugging

3844.52 --> 3848.64
it what if you don't take the drug

3846.68 --> 3851.48
anymore what then what are you going to

3848.64 --> 3853.319
do with it then I just need more drug oh

3851.48 --> 3855.92
so you can't function now without the

3853.319 --> 3860.839
drug can you I can function I can

3855.92 --> 3860.839
function without rlin very very

3861.039 --> 3868.2000000000003
well why because I learn earned to deal

3866.0 --> 3868.2
with

3871.039 --> 3878.44
it right so any parents out there you

3876.119 --> 3882.6800000000003
you got new children you got young kid

3878.44 --> 3882.68
never ever put them on

3883.319 --> 3890.52
rlin unless maybe they're so hyperactive

3888.68 --> 3891.5989999999997
that they literally get themselves

3890.52 --> 3894.559
physically

3891.599 --> 3897.0
hurt because I have there the

3894.559 --> 3899.52
hyperactivity has

3897.0 --> 3902.92
gradients yeah and there's people that

3899.52 --> 3906.44
are so hyperactive they literally

3902.92 --> 3909.0
just it's insane and like they get hurt

3906.44 --> 3911.76
from their own hyperactivity it's so bad

3909.0 --> 3914.799
right with those

3911.76 --> 3916.119
cases I'm going to say okay I I get it

3914.799 --> 3919.279
if you're going to take something for

3916.119 --> 3923.079
that but I still recommend you at least

3919.279 --> 3926.319
try to work on it without it and like

3923.079 --> 3929.4
that's a life mission too so technically

3926.319 --> 3931.88
I'd always advised against rlin for

3929.4 --> 3933.799
hyperactivity but I mean if they're so

3931.88 --> 3936.2400000000002
incredibly hyperactive that they

3933.799 --> 3938.16
literally get themselves physically hurt

3936.24 --> 3939.9199999999996
regularly because of

3938.16 --> 3944.0
it

3939.92 --> 3947.48
then I wouldn't blame you if you tried

3944.0 --> 3949.92
rlin but I still recommend that you try

3947.48 --> 3955.039
something else instead just more

3949.92 --> 3957.16
attention make the kid Focus it's like

3955.039 --> 3959.48
teach them that they have to focus it's

3957.16 --> 3959.48
for

3961.64 --> 3966.4
them like they have to learn that for

3964.319 --> 3969.359
themselves like they have to do that to

3966.4 --> 3971.96
to defend themselves

3969.359 --> 3975.799
right like it's a task it's a mission

3971.96 --> 3977.88
you you have to manage the

3975.799 --> 3979.48
hyperactivity versus the world because

3977.88 --> 3984.76
if you

3979.48 --> 3987.68
don't you will like become unstable and

3984.76 --> 3989.44
regarded as failed or as a mental

3987.68 --> 3990.5589999999997
patient and what are you going to do

3989.44 --> 3992.68
with your life

3990.559 --> 3996.2000000000003
then you

3992.68 --> 4001.0
know so you have to work on

3996.2 --> 4003.64
it and work on it before you even think

4001.0 --> 4008.68
about like medicating something like

4003.64 --> 4011.52
that always work on it first at least

4008.68 --> 4013.3999999999996
try right and then maybe you need it for

4011.52 --> 4015.0389999999998
a bit to like get you through it or

4013.4 --> 4017.079
something right there might be doctors

4015.039 --> 4018.7990000000004
that would like recommended like that

4017.079 --> 4021.96
like okay just work on the discipline

4018.799 --> 4024.52
this maybe like a camp Focus Camp a

4021.96 --> 4028.44
concentration camp perhaps right or

4024.52 --> 4031.279
hyperactive people and then

4028.44 --> 4035.96
maybe depending on the person like okay

4031.279 --> 4038.48
maybe some rlin for during that just to

4035.96 --> 4041.2
see like how they're different and what

4038.48 --> 4042.76
they can do with it but definitely not

4041.2 --> 4046.0789999999997
in mind like oh they're going to keep

4042.76 --> 4049.4
taking it no never like that so there's

4046.079 --> 4052.2000000000003
all kinds of way you can figure out a

4049.4 --> 4055.64
trajectory for your hyperactive kit that

4052.2 --> 4059.96
won't and help yeah that won't make them

4055.64 --> 4063.67
end up a math addict because quite

4059.96 --> 4066.119
frankly that's what rlin is it's

4063.67 --> 4072.599
[Music]

4066.119 --> 4072.599
meth and you do become addicted to

4072.92 --> 4079.44
meth taking

4075.48 --> 4079.44
rlin so you got to be very

4079.48 --> 4084.16
careful I hope you don't have that issue

4081.88 --> 4086.92
duper I hope you didn't have like a math

4084.16 --> 4090.5589999999997
addiction out of it cuz it just really

4086.92 --> 4093.279
sucks it's very unhealthy for you on the

4090.559 --> 4095.0
long run anyway I'm going to take a bite

4093.279 --> 4098.44
out of this Illuminati Kasam before it

4095.0 --> 4098.44
gets cold again

4102.839 --> 4107.199
cheers

[Music]

4108.96 --> 4113.44
wow slow M moon buggy that's [ __ ]

4114.799 --> 4121.08
up I'm glad they didn't win

4118.319 --> 4124.56
Jesus I mean

4121.08 --> 4127.359
that's yeah demonic people indeed I mean

4124.56 --> 4130.799
but those are like demonic psychiatrists

4127.359 --> 4134.56
that are they want to destroy

4130.799 --> 4138.08
people especially kids right destroy a

4134.56 --> 4141.359
kid and you got a patient for

4138.08 --> 4145.719
life you think that that's an

4141.359 --> 4146.1
unreasonable way to think about it well

4145.719 --> 4147.799
guess

4146.1 --> 4151.88
[Music]

4147.799 --> 4151.88
what there hordes of

4154.88 --> 4161.0
people that do think like that and they

4158.319 --> 4164.319
do get themselves involved in

4161.0 --> 4168.12
like Medical Health Care system

4164.319 --> 4168.120000000001
things so

4170.92 --> 4174.1
[Music]

4176.279 --> 4181.64
yeah right but hey duper you still there

4179.359 --> 4183.400000000001
I hope you're not on it anymore you got

4181.64 --> 4186.6
off it

4183.4 --> 4189.12
quick you didn't yeah what from what you

4186.6 --> 4192.719
said doesn't sound like you were liking

4189.12 --> 4195.719
it so that's a good

4192.719 --> 4195.719
thing

4200.8 --> 4206.4800000000005
yeah and by the way I think I mentioned

4204.12 --> 4207.84
it also like much later in life I did

4206.48 --> 4212.678999999999
actually

4207.84 --> 4215.719
try methamphetamine one time like a

4212.679 --> 4219.159
really really really tiny tiny

4215.719 --> 4223.32
Doses and it too made me kind of feel

4219.159 --> 4229.159
like a robot except here's the thing it

4223.32 --> 4229.159
made me feel like a downgraded

4230.48 --> 4237.599999999999
robot as in yeah this robot could

4234.56 --> 4240.719
function a lot more efficient and

4237.6 --> 4244.04
elaborate and functional and and it

4240.719 --> 4247.8
isn't it felt like a

4244.04 --> 4250.76
downgrade so yeah shouldn't surprise

4247.8 --> 4252.64
anybody that that was the only time I've

4250.76 --> 4255.2390000000005
ever tried

4252.64 --> 4257.76
that

4255.239 --> 4259.678999999999
was that some

4257.76 --> 4261.400000000001
punk

4259.679 --> 4265.4800000000005
some

4261.4 --> 4267.12
yeah punk band thing so it was like the

4265.48 --> 4271.44
place for that

4267.12 --> 4274.04
[ __ ] all those people are on that

4271.44 --> 4279.599999999999
crap but

4274.04 --> 4279.6
man it's a downgrade man math is is a

4280.32 --> 4286.84
downgrade yeah it might keep you awake

4284.04 --> 4289.719
but in a downgraded State what the [ __ ]

4286.84 --> 4289.719
are you going to do with

4292.8 --> 4298.04
that it

4295.8 --> 4300.6
just

4298.04 --> 4303.199
yeah un unless you were going to like

4300.6 --> 4305.719
force yourself to to be active and stay

4303.199 --> 4307.32
awake for something I don't can't even

4305.719 --> 4310.719
imagine why you would ever even

4307.32 --> 4310.719
considering touching the

4311.679 --> 4317.159
stuff and

4314.679 --> 4321.4800000000005
maybe it's better to just not force

4317.159 --> 4325.159
things and just have a normal Rhythm and

4321.48 --> 4328.5199999999995
sleep right healthier rest better

4325.159 --> 4328.5199999999995
function more

4328.76 --> 4332.08
durability all right

4332.56 --> 4339.639
anyway Yale University free therapist oh

4336.159 --> 4342.48
so it was an aw Marxist

4339.639 --> 4344.92
anti-human demon

4342.48 --> 4347.4
psychologist

4344.92 --> 4349.639
that sounds about right because they

4347.4 --> 4353.679
have

4349.639 --> 4353.679
those especially at the

4354.56 --> 4358.56

and should never ever have any function

4513.08 --> 4520.28
like that any medical

4517.0 --> 4522.199
function it's extremely irresponsible to

4520.28 --> 4523.44
give to people like

me you recorded that wow that's amazing

4588.8 --> 4594.56
you should definitely save that stuff I

4591.719 --> 4598.84
mean universities in the United States

4594.56 --> 4602.52
are communist hell holes right

4598.84 --> 4606.0
now and they should be let me be very

4602.52 --> 4609.360000000001
specific in my word use

4606.0 --> 4609.36
purged of

4610.8 --> 4619.159000000001

4615.92 --> 4621.8
their negligence and criminal activity

4619.159 --> 4624.5599999999995
it's all welcome because there's going

4621.8 --> 4629.2390000000005
to come a point where literally like

4624.56 --> 4633.280000000001
people come to just like start arresting

4629.239 --> 4634.799999999999
them like yeah you're actually traitors

4633.28 --> 4637.92
to the

4637.92 --> 4643.12
literally bragged about on your stupid

4639.96 --> 4646.719
social media like a [ __ ] [ __ ] and

slowmo but that's like Crim that's

4727.679 --> 4733.4
criminal you can't just say somebody's

4730.8 --> 4737.92
hopelessly depressed when they are

4733.4 --> 4737.92
provably not that's

4739.199 --> 4744.0
criminal

4741.48 --> 4746.718999999999
like if you like have a function like

4744.0 --> 4748.679
that that's criminal if you're just some

4746.719 --> 4750.0
random person that's one thing right

4748.679 --> 4754.719
that's just a

4772.88 --> 4777.36
crazy so buggy thanks for sharing

4780.52 --> 4785.92
though what was my

4782.6 --> 4789.2390000000005
point oh yeah yeah I was thinking there

4785.92 --> 4790.84
are so many of these [ __ ] Marxist

4789.239 --> 4793.879999999999
anti-national

4790.84 --> 4795.639

4793.88 --> 4798.6
and they're going to need replacing but

4795.639 --> 4799.4400000000005
you see who's going to replace them I

4798.6 --> 4804.04
got a

4799.44 --> 4804.04
solution a solution is going to be very

4805.6 --> 4811.2390000000005
unexpected

4808.52 --> 4812.360000000001
migrants you got a lot of them right

4811.239 --> 4815.638999999999
what are you going to do what you're

4812.36 --> 4817.639
going to kill them all uh no like you

4815.639 --> 4820.88
probably wouldn't even be able to do

4817.639 --> 4823.679
that even if you were going to try it so

4820.88 --> 4826.679
what are you going to do well

4823.679 --> 4830.12
what if you just Purge the

4826.679 --> 4834.2390000000005
Marxist and then you

4830.12 --> 4835.84
have a selection of competent migrants

4834.239 --> 4838.239
take their place they're going to come

4835.84 --> 4841.52
from places where they're

4838.239 --> 4843.799999999999
not like they aren't complete shws

4841.52 --> 4848.400000000001
that's why they even came and took the

4843.8 --> 4848.400000000001
journey to migrate shws don't do

4848.76 --> 4854.0
that they're too

4851.159 --> 4855.799999999999
delusional to actually do things they

4854.0 --> 4856.679
only get in everybody else's way where

4855.8 --> 4860.4800000000005
they're

4856.679 --> 4864.56
at so maybe you could

4860.48 --> 4866.678999999999
just like just replace the shws with

4864.56 --> 4869.280000000001
migrants right I mean how could they

4866.679 --> 4869.28
object to

4869.84 --> 4875.0
that because I don't think that they're

4872.12 --> 4878.08
even going to be replaced by regular

4875.0 --> 4880.44
people with the same

4878.08 --> 4881.639
professions oh but maybe I'm wrong maybe

4880.44 --> 4884.08
they are out

4881.639 --> 4885.4400000000005
there

4884.08 --> 4888.4
and I'm just saying like there are so

4885.44 --> 4890.48
many freaking sjw demon people out there

4888.4 --> 4892.879999999999
in the US you're going to have to get

4890.48 --> 4896.5599999999995
rid of them but then what do you fill it

4892.88 --> 4899.88
with right well you got a lot of

4896.56 --> 4903.88
migrants right and as soon as the shw

4899.88 --> 4907.56
demon influence is gone those migrants

4903.88 --> 4910.0
could over time actually be transformed

4907.56 --> 4912.280000000001
to be halfway decent

4910.0 --> 4914.719
Americans yeah now with all those

4912.28 --> 4915.92
freaking sjw around that's definitely

4914.719 --> 4919.84
not going to happen because they're

4915.92 --> 4922.4
going to be race Bas baiting

4919.84 --> 4924.92
freaks that are obsessed with other

4922.4 --> 4928.32
races and [ __ ] that's what the sjws turn

4924.92 --> 4929.52
migrants into if you have the sjws taken

4928.32 --> 4933.84
out of the

4929.52 --> 4935.8
picture then those migrants could like

4933.84 --> 4940.56
really work

4935.8 --> 4940.56
out even with the insane amounts of

4940.8 --> 4944.56
them I'm just thinking

4949.48 --> 4954.199
right because that's what it is it's

4951.04 --> 4956.96
like oh new migrants that's new migrants

4954.199 --> 4959.879999999999
is not a problem it's only a

4956.96 --> 4964.199
problem if they're not going to be

4959.88 --> 4967.2390000000005
properly taught not properly

4964.199 --> 4969.96
integrated right that's the problem what

4967.239 --> 4971.959999999999
causes that problem people that don't

4969.96 --> 4975.719
want them to properly integrate that

4971.96 --> 4978.4
just want them to be mind control slaves

4975.719 --> 4980.159
like sjws and

4978.4 --> 4981.879999999999
liberals

4980.159 --> 4985.759999999999
Democrats

4981.88 --> 4985.76
so how do you fix that

4985.8 --> 4991.92
issue how do you make migration not a

4989.52 --> 4991.92
problem

4992.44 --> 4998.0
anymore by taking down all the obstacles

4995.56 --> 5000.56
that would prevent migrants from

4998.0 --> 5000.56
properly

5001.48 --> 5004.48
integrating

5007.8 --> 5014.88
yeah situation really isn't as

5011.48 --> 5017.678999999999
hopeless as you would think it is if you

5014.88 --> 5019.719
just just think about it think a little

5017.679 --> 5022.2390000000005
bit

5019.719 --> 5024.6
more than just only what's right in

5022.239 --> 5024.599999999999
front of

5025.12 --> 5029.92
you anyway did everybody now leave is

5028.0 --> 5034.0
this the time to leave

5029.92 --> 5036.2390000000005
again after free time to leave Arwin

5034.0 --> 5037.84
alone all of a sudden out of nowhere

5036.239 --> 5040.48
maybe there's a

5037.84 --> 5043.0
Premiere which is much more interesting

5040.48 --> 5048.599999999999
than an actual live show you can like

5043.0 --> 5048.6
literally live interact with right

5061.36 --> 5064.36
guys

5085.0 --> 5094.36
hello three o' is not the cue for

5088.76 --> 5094.360000000001
everyone to suddenly leave my chat

5099.16 --> 5104.4
[Music]

5101.639 --> 5106.639
and without even giving an up vot what

5104.4 --> 5106.638999999999
is

5106.76 --> 5115.04
this why do I only see one upot on my

5110.28 --> 5115.04
show when I had like 10 people in my

5121.28 --> 5124.28
chat

5124.719 --> 5129.08
all right I have to work on the title

5126.52 --> 5132.0
what I'm going to call this

5129.08 --> 5134.96
thing and where the hell is duper duper

5132.0 --> 5139.679
I had a whole freaking conversation from

5134.96 --> 5139.679

5226.199 --> 5231.08
he didn't even show up in the in Skype

5228.44 --> 5234.44
so and he didn't expect

5231.08 --> 5236.44
him so no there's no fed show but

5234.44 --> 5238.5599999999995
apparently a premier is enough for

5236.44 --> 5241.32
everybody to just go away because oh my

5238.56 --> 5243.119000000001
God we can't listen to Arwin anymore

5241.32 --> 5245.44
we're going to just have to listen to a

5243.119 --> 5246.88
pre-recording of something it's much

5245.44 --> 5249.759999999999
more interesting than something you

5246.88 --> 5253.159000000001
could live interact with and ask

5249.76 --> 5255.4800000000005
questions and have direct answers to

5253.159 --> 5257.759999999999
those questions in that very moment

5255.48 --> 5261.599999999999
manifest who would want to do that when

5257.76 --> 5263.860000000001
you can watch some pre-recorded

5261.6 --> 5271.119000000001

thing I did yesterday

5452.76 --> 5459.159000000001

5455.239 --> 5460.718999999999
yell at you before you do

5459.159 --> 5464.04
anything

5460.719 --> 5464.04
oh maybe

5465.159 --> 5470.159
not wow your first high school

5467.28 --> 5473.199
girlfriend became a

5470.159 --> 5475.44
[ __ ] that's

5473.199 --> 5478.759999999999
horrifying I'm pretty damn sure that

5475.44 --> 5480.759999999999
every single girlfriend I had they none

5478.76 --> 5484.679
of them became

5480.76 --> 5487.400000000001
sjw most of them had

5484.679 --> 5489.719
kids it's really weird to be proud of

5487.4 --> 5493.04
like oh all my ex-girlfriends have

5489.719 --> 5494.84
kids but I mean it does feel like yeah

5493.04 --> 5497.199
but at least I sent them in the right

5494.84 --> 5500.119000000001
direction even though that direction

5497.199 --> 5500.119
didn't have me in

5510.76 --> 5513.76
it

5525.9 --> 5528.96
[Music]

5529.52 --> 5534.96
how do I know they all have kids because

5532.48 --> 5534.959999999999
they told

5536.88 --> 5543.08
me like I have contact with my axes why

5540.56 --> 5546.92
do I have contact with my a

5543.08 --> 5549.5199999999995
because I never break up

5546.92 --> 5552.1990000000005
ugly if there's going to be some ugly

5549.52 --> 5554.52

5552.199 --> 5557.599999999999
going to keep to myself and not going to

5554.52 --> 5561.280000000001
Knack them with

5557.6 --> 5563.280000000001
right but I make sure it's like no

5561.28 --> 5565.08
because there's this thing about me and

5563.28 --> 5569.239
that is like once I fall in love with

5565.08 --> 5573.88
somebody it never goes away it never

5569.239 --> 5573.879999999999

5589.96 --> 5594.92

5600.56 --> 5603.56
impossible

5608.639 --> 5614.1990000000005
right and and they called me because my

5610.88 --> 5615.96
exes call me because they're they care

5614.199 --> 5619.199

hope don't know if she is even alive

5633.8 --> 5638.320000000001

5636.44 --> 5641.36
just kind of nice to hang around with

5638.32 --> 5643.44
third girlfriend had like two kids or

5641.36 --> 5646.04
even three I'm not

5643.44 --> 5650.159
sure she called me

5646.04 --> 5652.8
like in the summer this year and like

5650.159 --> 5655.4
just hearing her voice I know like like

5652.8 --> 5657.76
I'm still in love with you I just knew

5655.4 --> 5660.119
it and she was like oh I look so silly

5666.239 --> 5673.959999999999
but I mean husband took the vax and

5669.36 --> 5673.96
everything so don't know for how much

5674.679 --> 5681.1990000000005
longer you

5677.84 --> 5684.679
know but yeah that she was like my

5681.199 --> 5686.5599999999995
biggest love that was the first time I

5684.679 --> 5689.84
really fell in love with somebody like

5686.56 --> 5691.639
for really hard first girlfriend I did

5689.84 --> 5695.4800000000005
also but that was just like my my

5691.639 --> 5698.32
virginity thing so it wasn't full on but

5695.48 --> 5699.919999999999
she was like my biggest Muse ever and

5698.32 --> 5701.639
she knew it and she was like yeah I'll

5699.92 --> 5704.8
be M your Muse

5701.639 --> 5707.96
yay I'm like oh my God I love you so

5704.8 --> 5711.4800000000005
much right

5707.96 --> 5711.4800000000005
and fourth

5714.44 --> 5720.4
girlfriend

5716.0 --> 5724.639
yeah she act she didn't become a Marxist

5720.4 --> 5724.638999999999
sjw she was always

5725.56 --> 5730.92
that right but I mean that relationship

5728.8 --> 5732.159000000001
didn't even last long when it was still

5730.92 --> 5735.92
fresh

5732.159 --> 5738.92
so uh and then after that yeah I had a

5735.92 --> 5740.84
girlfriend which I did really love it's

5738.92 --> 5743.88
really tall woman that was way taller

5740.84 --> 5747.56
than me it was a really long person but

5743.88 --> 5750.2390000000005
she's so sweet H but she got

5747.56 --> 5752.92
like basically she was just kind of

5750.239 --> 5756.08
going around and I actually helped her

5752.92 --> 5757.4
convince her to like get back with the

5756.08 --> 5760.5199999999995
love of her

5757.4 --> 5762.36
life because for me it wasn't that super

5760.52 --> 5766.4400000000005
serious a relationship but I did really

5762.36 --> 5768.88
love her though and she did she did come

5766.44 --> 5771.5199999999995
back go back to her like and I think

5768.88 --> 5773.4400000000005
they're like married and they have kids

5771.52 --> 5776.4800000000005
I don't know if they have kids but they

5773.44 --> 5780.239
definitely could could have

5776.48 --> 5780.239
them then after

5780.32 --> 5783.32
that

5791.679 --> 5795.56
yeah after that I I kind of just dated

5793.76 --> 5797.2390000000005
around a bunch I didn't really even know

5795.56 --> 5800.0
them

5797.239 --> 5804.599999999999
well that's after that was like dating

5800.0 --> 5807.239
around time and then that stopped after

5804.6 --> 5807.2390000000005
I met my

5807.84 --> 5814.400000000001
ex how did it end with girl three

5812.08 --> 5815.88
uh we were like together for two years

5814.4 --> 5820.0
and

5815.88 --> 5820.0
then I don't know she kind of

5822.119 --> 5827.08
like like I wasn't really super good as

5825.8 --> 5832.76
a

5827.08 --> 5832.76
boyfriend and she just like ended

5837.6 --> 5841.96
it and after that I was really

5840.159 --> 5845.48
heartbroken about that and I actually

5841.96 --> 5848.88
Dove right into the gothic scene after

5845.48 --> 5851.28
that that's after my third

5848.88 --> 5855.400000000001
girlfriend my longest relationship is

5851.28 --> 5855.4
with my current ex that was three

5856.88 --> 5861.52
years although technically it's probably

5859.639 --> 5864.679
two years and the last year I just kind

5861.52 --> 5864.679
of like refused to go

5869.36 --> 5878.159
away because we were living in the same

5874.0 --> 5878.159
house not pleasant right

5880.48 --> 5887.799999999999
anyway but yeah my relationships tend to

5883.44 --> 5891.4

6073.52 --> 6077.76
out what can be done why it is there

6076.119 --> 6083.159
what I can do about

6077.76 --> 6083.159000000001
it and then I can leave leave it

6083.8 --> 6088.28

[Music]

6130.32 --> 6134.719
work you don't mind some secrets you

6132.719 --> 6136.84
figure it out yeah but for me it is

6134.719 --> 6139.76
about them trying to keep it a secret

6136.84 --> 6142.76
from me I find that absolutely

6139.76 --> 6142.76
unacceptable

6145.4 --> 6149.199
okay I'm going to say that something

6146.679 --> 6151.719
that sounds a little bit weird so don't

6149.199 --> 6154.759999999999
take it all to literal or whatever

6151.719 --> 6158.599
but let's just say I had a girlfriend

6154.76 --> 6160.92
and she cheated on me yeah and then I

6158.599 --> 6160.92
found

6161.639 --> 6169.4400000000005
out the thing that would [ __ ] me up is

6165.92 --> 6172.08
that she kept it a secret I mean The

6169.44 --> 6173.719
Wider implications on what person she is

6172.08 --> 6176.119
and what kind of relationship it's going

6173.719 --> 6178.36
to be yeah it's pretty heavy and it's

6176.119 --> 6182.598999999999
painful and all that but it's the

6178.36 --> 6186.48
Keeping a Secret that's really the

6182.599 --> 6192.119000000001
Destroyer I even told my ex this it's

6186.48 --> 6194.36
like yeah like you're so freaking hot I

6192.119 --> 6196.04
like I'm almost I didn't say it like but

6194.36 --> 6198.28
inally I was thinking like I'm almost

6196.04 --> 6199.84
expecting you to like you're probably

6198.28 --> 6202.28
going to cheat on me you're so freaking

6199.84 --> 6204.119000000001
hot it's like can you avoid

6202.28 --> 6207.32
it

6204.119 --> 6208.48
like I really would probably forgive you

6207.32 --> 6213.84
for

6208.48 --> 6216.0
it just never keep it a secret and then

6213.84 --> 6217.92
we're all good and we can all move you

6216.0 --> 6220.48
don't even have to feel guilty as long

6217.92 --> 6224.92
as you don't keep it a

6220.48 --> 6227.32
secret and I think that well she did

6224.92 --> 6230.08
probably cheat on me I can't prove it

6227.32 --> 6232.04
and I don't care anymore anyway but she

6230.08 --> 6235.36
definitely kept secrets from me and I

6232.04 --> 6238.719
started to notice and that's really

6235.36 --> 6241.598999999999
when Panic starts on my side and then I

6238.719 --> 6245.0
lose confidence and then I lose all my

6241.599 --> 6245.0
Powers that's what

6246.76 --> 6253.76
happens I become weak and fragile and

6250.56 --> 6255.88
demoralized and slavish can either

6253.76 --> 6257.92
become really aggressive and like fight

6255.88 --> 6260.400000000001

6257.92 --> 6261.159
out of here I don't want to see you or I

slavish which is like yeah I'll do

whatever you say just please don't send

6265.44 --> 6268.36
me

6266.199 --> 6271.32
away and that's what happened that's

6268.36 --> 6273.839999999999
what I became it's maybe humiliating but

6271.32 --> 6277.92
hey I was good at it and it kept me

6273.84 --> 6277.92
apart it it kept me in one

you don't [ __ ] disrespect me

6384.28 --> 6388.159

you're going to do that in a one-on-one

6388.159 --> 6391.96

6425.679 --> 6431.04
I mean

6428.239 --> 6433.4
retrospect she was like out of my league

6431.04 --> 6437.36
in that sense like I

6433.4 --> 6438.96
couldn't like socially compete with her

6437.36 --> 6442.32

things I just had intelligence I'm

6454.119 --> 6460.48
goodlooking and caring and that's it and

6458.04 --> 6462.239
she was just starting to downplay me

6460.48 --> 6464.919999999999
more and more as time

6462.239 --> 6467.4
passed and then I'm like yeah I'm sorry

6464.92 --> 6469.88
I'm not your sex

6467.4 --> 6471.44
doll and she would think that's funny

6469.88 --> 6474.56
when I said said that and I was like no

6471.44 --> 6477.5199999999995

it

6644.199 --> 6649.04
are coming to visit Spain what pay for

6647.599 --> 6651.88
it that'll be

6649.04 --> 6655.44
crazy

6651.88 --> 6655.4400000000005
do show no no

6657.079 --> 6661.5599999999995

6659.52 --> 6663.84
literally take my entire computer with

6661.56 --> 6667.400000000001
me and I'm definitely not going to take

6663.84 --> 6670.2390000000005
my entire desktop computer with me on

6667.4 --> 6671.879999999999
the train thanks thanks for the

6670.239 --> 6674.919999999999
suggestion

6671.88 --> 6678.96
though maybe a visit sometimes might be

6674.92 --> 6681.96
nice but definitely not to do a show

6678.96 --> 6681.96
there

6683.8 --> 6690.360000000001
maybe a video if you like record with

6686.32 --> 6690.36
your mobile or something but not a

6693.239 --> 6700.239
show us your setup I don't know if I can

6696.84 --> 6700.2390000000005
use your [ __ ] up

6703.92 --> 6708.639
but yeah I

6706.28 --> 6712.36
mean even trying that I could

6708.639 --> 6712.36
potentially screw your computer

6717.28 --> 6720.88
up so

6721.88 --> 6728.56
yeah but who knows we'll see it's just

6726.04 --> 6731.48
that I'm not really going anywhere even

6728.56 --> 6737.079000000001
if I did get paid for it I'm just not

6731.48 --> 6739.5199999999995
really I don't want to move away to

6737.079 --> 6742.759999999999
anything I want to stay here I want to

6739.52 --> 6747.2390000000005
stay in this country in this

6742.76 --> 6747.2390000000005
location I don't want to go anywhere

6749.92 --> 6754.96
else right I got the feeling like if I

6752.52 --> 6756.679
leave then suddenly like it might close

6754.96 --> 6759.199
up and I literally wouldn't be able to

6756.679 --> 6760.56
get back that's what it feels like right

6759.199 --> 6763.28
now

6760.56 --> 6766.119000000001
here cuz there's a lot of weird [ __ ]

6763.28 --> 6769.48
going on and our government is really

6766.119 --> 6771.799999999999
super overtly criminal now and it's

6769.48 --> 6775.598999999999

6771.8 --> 6778.159000000001

6780.76 --> 6787.56

government like dismantled

6791.96 --> 6797.28
dyes for absolutely no logical reason

6795.48 --> 6800.0
they dismantled them and there's floods

6797.28 --> 6802.44

6800.0 --> 6806.599
we're dealing here we with here like the

6802.44 --> 6811.119
government is actively sabotaging the

6806.599 --> 6813.4400000000005
place like very overtly that's not a

6811.119 --> 6816.119
safe

6813.44 --> 6817.48
condition to like start like oh let's

6816.119 --> 6820.04
just move

6817.48 --> 6822.159
around oh really well the the government

6820.04 --> 6824.32
is sabotaging the country yeah that that

6822.159 --> 6826.92
seems like not a good time to just like

6824.32 --> 6828.759999999999
move around because how do you know you

6826.92 --> 6831.76

6961.0 --> 6964.04
you know they can fix the right well

6962.52 --> 6967.040000000001
they could

6964.04 --> 6969.36
with some

6967.04 --> 6971.679
geoengineering but yeah you're right

6969.36 --> 6972.839999999999
they're not fixing they're like meddling

6971.679 --> 6974.88
with the

6972.84 --> 6976.4800000000005
weather right they got all this weather

6974.88 --> 6978.52
control and what they're doing with it

6976.48 --> 6983.159
is trying to

6978.52 --> 6985.4800000000005
exaggerate exacerbate make worse typical

6983.159 --> 6987.239
problems so that they can blame it on

6985.48 --> 6991.5599999999995
climate change when they are like

6987.239 --> 6991.5599999999995
actively in control causing

6991.76 --> 7000.0
that because they're overt

6995.96 --> 7000.0
criminals climate change

7000.8 --> 7005.76
activism is

7003.56 --> 7008.679
terrorist they're

7005.76 --> 7011.0
terrorists they're terrorist criminals

7008.679 --> 7014.28
they lie about everything they cause the

7011.0 --> 7017.679
problems that they claim are caused by

7014.28 --> 7019.04
you with your breathing and your using

7017.679 --> 7021.36
of

7019.04 --> 7024.0
things that

7021.36 --> 7026.48
horeshit they cause it and then they

7024.0 --> 7029.639
literally claim that that's you that

7026.48 --> 7030.638999999999
caused it they caus it they cause

7029.639 --> 7033.88
climate

7030.639 --> 7038.96
change they cause things to get

7033.88 --> 7041.079
worse they prevent problems from being

7038.96 --> 7044.0
applied to fix

7041.079 --> 7046.759999999999
things when it could they do it on

7044.0 --> 7048.92
purpose because they want to blame

7046.76 --> 7050.56
everything on people

7048.92 --> 7053.639
existing

7050.56 --> 7056.360000000001
because the solution to climate change

7053.639 --> 7059.88
is exterminate All

7056.36 --> 7062.719
Humans yeah that's the solution to

7059.88 --> 7064.079
climate change exterminate All Humans

7062.719 --> 7066.56
what you think that's

7064.079 --> 7069.679
exagerated why' you go dig in the

7066.56 --> 7070.679
freaking papers look into the history of

7069.679 --> 7073.52
those

7070.679 --> 7078.4400000000005
people that promote

7073.52 --> 7083.079000000001
it they're all into it they're all

7078.44 --> 7088.598999999999
genocidal ists they all dream about fear

7083.079 --> 7088.599
porn scenarios in which a humanity is

7090.719 --> 7097.679
exterminated climate change activists

7093.48 --> 7101.5599999999995
are terrorist anti

7097.679 --> 7104.88
humans and it should be declared as such

7101.56 --> 7108.92
barred from public

7104.88 --> 7114.159000000001
office of any sort in the entire world

7108.92 --> 7119.0
and they should be put on the list of

7114.159 --> 7119.0
mental illnesses which they clearly

7128.32 --> 7131.32
are

7134.48 --> 7140.5199999999995
right and even by their own ideology if

7138.76 --> 7142.0
you really if they get extreme they get

7140.52 --> 7145.079000000001
militant or

7142.0 --> 7148.0
whatever the greatest enemy of a climate

7145.079 --> 7150.599
change activist is

7148.0 --> 7155.0
themselves the ultimate goal of the

7150.599 --> 7155.0
climate change activist is mass

7158.239 --> 7161.239
suicide

7166.0 --> 7169.76
so I'd say get on with

7169.96 --> 7176.679
it right the sooner the better like we

7173.56 --> 7178.92
we'll manage we'll be all right yeah you

7176.679 --> 7181.119
go die for your cause and we'll we'll be

7178.92 --> 7181.119
all

7186.56 --> 7191.56
right like we'll learn from your mistake

7189.719 --> 7193.159
okay don't worry about it you you just

7191.56 --> 7195.400000000001
go end

7193.159 --> 7198.119
yourselves remove yourself from the

7195.4 --> 7199.879999999999
equation save your Earth and then we'll

7198.119 --> 7201.44
be all right we'll learn your lessons

7199.88 --> 7202.679
and we'll move on without you that

7201.44 --> 7207.0
that's

7202.679 --> 7207.0
cool don't worry we'll take care of the

7218.159 --> 7221.159
world

7221.26 --> 7224.39
[Music]

7227.19 --> 7230.45
[Music]

7235.4 --> 7243.719
save the Earth [ __ ] in the

7238.92 --> 7246.36
80s I like saving the earth I like it

7243.719 --> 7248.679
it's just that if you're going to be

7246.36 --> 7250.4
like oh save the Earth get money for

7248.679 --> 7251.84
saving the Earth and then it ends up in

7250.4 --> 7255.119
the hands of

7251.84 --> 7257.719
foundations that are honed by people

7255.119 --> 7260.96
that literally have Ambitions to lower

7257.719 --> 7264.36
the earth population well maybe you're

7260.96 --> 7268.96
not really doing the right thing

7264.36 --> 7271.5199999999995
then right but I mean screw

7268.96 --> 7274.159
that it's these [ __ ] foundations that

7271.52 --> 7276.320000000001
are the problem not people wanting to

7274.159 --> 7280.28
help others and save the world and and

7276.32 --> 7282.92
make nature more healthy

7280.28 --> 7285.199
I like that it's a good impulse it's a

7282.92 --> 7290.56
good thing to

7285.199 --> 7292.759999999999
want just know your leadership realize

7290.56 --> 7295.76
there is freaking

7292.76 --> 7298.2390000000005
demons that have those ideas too and

7295.76 --> 7302.1990000000005
want to manipulate everybody into

7298.239 --> 7306.28
becoming human extermin ISS you have to

7302.199 --> 7309.678999999999
know that you have to realize that you

7306.28 --> 7314.04
have to protect yourself and your loved

7309.679 --> 7318.719
ones from that by informing them about

7314.04 --> 7320.84
that before they get into it yeah don't

7318.719 --> 7322.88
wait oh oh you just to hang around with

7320.84 --> 7324.28
the friends oh we don't have to tell

7322.88 --> 7325.36
them anything oh they'll come with

7324.28 --> 7327.079
questions to us and then they're going

7325.36 --> 7329.04
to come with questions to you and then

7327.079 --> 7331.719
they're going to say yeah hey Dad Dad

7329.04 --> 7334.44
hey I'm an sjw it's so cool it's the

7331.719 --> 7336.96
thing yeah yeah yeah you're too late now

7334.44 --> 7338.759999999999
now they're into the [ __ ] agendas now

7336.96 --> 7341.679
you have to try to pull them out of it

7338.76 --> 7343.8
but it's their thing so they don't want

7341.679 --> 7345.639
to be pulled out of it because you

7343.8 --> 7347.28
waited too long and now they got

7345.639 --> 7350.28
entangled with something that's going to

7347.28 --> 7351.28
slowly strangle them and you the rest of

7350.28 --> 7355.0
their

7351.28 --> 7356.079
lives because you didn't give them the

7355.0 --> 7359.88
proper

7356.079 --> 7362.48
warnings before they set out and got to

7359.88 --> 7366.28
know about these people and these things

7362.48 --> 7370.239
yeah you have to actually give them the

7366.28 --> 7371.92
right information before they do that

7370.239 --> 7373.598999999999
and not

7371.92 --> 7376.04
after

7373.599 --> 7378.96
idiots negligent

7376.04 --> 7381.5199999999995
idiots you got to give them the info

7378.96 --> 7385.199
before they go to the place before they

7381.52 --> 7387.679
get into the new school not after not

7385.199 --> 7392.119
after they're already in they have to be

7387.679 --> 7394.8
warned about the really really bad pit

7392.119 --> 7399.119
traps that are there and cannot be

7394.8 --> 7402.28
avoided you have to let them know how

7399.119 --> 7403.96
serious that is and how dangerous that

7402.28 --> 7407.159
really

7403.96 --> 7410.32
is you can't just let them roll into it

7407.159 --> 7413.0
they'll entangle with it now their

7410.32 --> 7415.719
personal feelings are invested in it and

7413.0 --> 7420.52
will block any reason you try to

7415.719 --> 7420.52
dispense to them you have to be there

7423.559 --> 7426.559
first

7427.88 --> 7432.88
anyway

7429.92 --> 7435.719
you to do ice surgery for poor people in

7432.88 --> 7438.559
India well that doesn't sound terrible

7435.719 --> 7440.36
Soo I mean in India I was really poor

7438.559 --> 7444.0
back

7440.36 --> 7446.119
then so I mean that sounds like your

7444.0 --> 7448.48
fundraiser that you did with your band

7446.119 --> 7452.119
actually did some

7448.48 --> 7455.32
good right I mean that setup would be

7452.119 --> 7457.719
super Shady if it happened right now but

7455.32 --> 7459.719
from back then that's that's really that

7457.719 --> 7461.4800000000005
sounds really good slow moon buggy I

7459.719 --> 7463.92
don't think there's anything there to be

7461.48 --> 7463.919999999999
ashamed

7466.8 --> 7472.1990000000005
of sounds like a good thing like helping

7471.03 --> 7475.4
[Music]

7472.199 --> 7475.4
people why

7478.04 --> 7481.239
not all

7485.159 --> 7489.638999999999
right it's always more risky when

7487.679 --> 7491.4
there's like some kind of foundation and

7489.639 --> 7494.0
poor people involved when they start to

7491.4 --> 7496.28
talk about starvation like all these

7494.0 --> 7499.199
people have been starving for so long

7496.28 --> 7501.44
and like that's always very

7499.199 --> 7504.759999999999
suspicious when it's about

7501.44 --> 7507.04
starvation because a lot of the time

7504.76 --> 7508.599
it's literally just artificially kept

7507.04 --> 7513.5199999999995
like

7508.599 --> 7516.159000000001
that it's like okay we take these tribes

7513.52 --> 7519.559
now we're going to besiege these tribes

7516.159 --> 7522.04
and then we use that to drawn a lot of

7519.559 --> 7524.52
attention oh these people need help that

7522.04 --> 7527.559
you are besieging yeah you're besieging

7524.52 --> 7529.599
them oh they need help oh please send

7527.559 --> 7533.8
the money for that we can help them get

7529.599 --> 7536.04
the food because you are besieging them

7533.8 --> 7539.1990000000005
yeah that actually does happen you have

7536.04 --> 7541.48
to be very careful but if it's like oh

7539.199 --> 7544.5199999999995
poor people in India need I

7541.48 --> 7546.4
surgery there's no there's no gravel

7544.52 --> 7549.280000000001
there that that sounds like no that's

7546.4 --> 7553.0
just exactly what it is

7549.28 --> 7556.5199999999995
I mean they didn't like give people eye

7553.0 --> 7559.199
problems just to do that no people just

7556.52 --> 7562.559
had eye problems and they wanted to help

7559.199 --> 7562.558999999999
some so it sounds all

7574.679 --> 7580.599
great

7577.599 --> 7580.599
yeah

7584.0 --> 7591.84
[Music]

7593.44 --> 7599.879999999999
yeah I me personally I was always

7596.239 --> 7604.079
like very concerned about

7599.88 --> 7607.599
water like things where it's like oh we

7604.079 --> 7609.759999999999
create Wells for tribes in Africa or

7607.599 --> 7612.52
something like that's something I'm like

7609.76 --> 7614.360000000001
yeah that's awesome that's always good

7612.52 --> 7615.88
especially if you teach them how to

7614.36 --> 7618.639
build it

7615.88 --> 7622.04
themselves that's even more

7618.639 --> 7625.559
amazing I like that kind of thing when

7622.04 --> 7629.5199999999995
it comes to like organizations that help

7625.559 --> 7631.559
the less fortunate and all that

7629.52 --> 7633.4400000000005
internationally I like it when it's like

7631.559 --> 7635.639
building things that are like really

7633.44 --> 7637.5199999999995
durable that can use for Generations

7635.639 --> 7640.52
that's the type of thing I really

7637.52 --> 7640.52
like

7640.559 --> 7645.92
like let's just say there's Africa it's

7643.96 --> 7649.199
like oh it's developing but yeah they

7645.92 --> 7651.679
they don't have electricity and like

7649.199 --> 7654.159
well you could build a dam it sounds

7651.679 --> 7657.079
dramatic it might be environmentally not

7654.159 --> 7658.96
feasible but maybe you could make it and

7657.079 --> 7661.199
then build a dam and then suddenly that

7658.96 --> 7663.4
region has this

7661.199 --> 7664.919999999999
electricity well that's super helpful

7663.4 --> 7667.5199999999995
for

7664.92 --> 7670.52
them

7667.52 --> 7670.52
right

7672.32 --> 7676.558999999999
because and by the way like giving

7674.48 --> 7679.0
regions availability to like

7676.559 --> 7681.639
technological things that's very helpful

7679.0 --> 7684.559
also for the rest of the world because

7681.639 --> 7688.28
they got something to connect with and

7684.559 --> 7690.04
do more exchanges now so that like is

7688.28 --> 7694.719
like a multiplying effect the more

7690.04 --> 7697.44
people have availability of Technology

7694.719 --> 7699.639
the the better it will be for everything

7697.44 --> 7702.719
else

7699.639 --> 7702.719
well heighten

7705.079 --> 7708.079
competition

7719.4 --> 7724.799999999999
ETC whals American Urban environment

7722.679 --> 7728.119
City T is water is

7724.8 --> 7730.04
horrible I bet it is which is really

7728.119 --> 7733.04
weird by the way slowmo because it

7730.04 --> 7735.48
wouldn't need to be yeah the water

7733.04 --> 7738.84
treatment plants that we use here in the

7735.48 --> 7740.759999999999
Netherlands are fine even in the big

7738.84 --> 7743.1990000000005
cities like they're not super in the big

7740.76 --> 7745.4800000000005
cities they're always worse but I mean

7743.199 --> 7748.598999999999
it's pretty good and there's so many

7745.48 --> 7750.36
things you can even do technologically

7748.599 --> 7753.679
to improve water

7750.36 --> 7757.159
quality even after it just came out of a

7753.679 --> 7761.599
Refinery there's things you can

7757.159 --> 7766.4
do right you can make the water

7761.599 --> 7768.8
Alive by Crystal resonance like every

7766.4 --> 7771.44
water treatment plant in the world

7768.8 --> 7773.360000000001
should have a device like that those

7771.44 --> 7776.558999999999
devices exist they have existed for like

7773.36 --> 7779.558999999999
20 years like I have one in the form of

7776.559 --> 7782.0
a pen a pener that you can literally

7779.559 --> 7784.360000000001
stir water with and then it changes the

7782.0 --> 7787.32
structure of the water it becomes

7784.36 --> 7789.92
better like you can see that the water

7787.32 --> 7793.36
is different it looks different it

7789.92 --> 7796.719
ripples different after you do that that

7793.36 --> 7799.32
is just by touch just by proximity a

7796.719 --> 7801.76
device like that could be built in every

7799.32 --> 7805.159
single water treatment plant and it

7801.76 --> 7807.280000000001
would like dramatically like surreal

7805.159 --> 7810.44
levels of dramatic

7807.28 --> 7813.36
difference of water quality

7810.44 --> 7815.5199999999995
anywhere no matter how big the city no

7813.36 --> 7818.92
matter where in the

7815.52 --> 7821.0
world they could dramatically improve

7818.92 --> 7825.84
the quality of the

7821.0 --> 7830.4
water no not Pizer pener pen just

7825.84 --> 7830.400000000001
Energizer with a p in front of

7832.8 --> 7838.679
it right that's the pen version there

7835.719 --> 7844.52
are systems that you can literally put

7838.679 --> 7844.52
in your plumbing right around your

7844.719 --> 7853.0
water uh yeah water tap devices you like

7850.52 --> 7855.320000000001
as you put them on it and that

7853.0 --> 7857.52
transforms the water automatically just

7855.32 --> 7859.639
coming out of the tap you don't have to

7857.52 --> 7862.599
stir anything it just automatically does

7859.639 --> 7866.84
it as you open the

7862.599 --> 7866.84
tap structured water that's

7871.639 --> 7879.76
right I did post a video about

7876.159 --> 7882.44
that yesterday at the very very very

7879.76 --> 7885.04
beginning of my

7882.44 --> 7886.4
show video from Greg Reese about the

7885.04 --> 7890.559
human

7886.4 --> 7893.199
heart it's in there so just go watch

7890.559 --> 7894.96
that and then you'll know what I mean

7893.199 --> 7896.598999999999
with structured water where I'm getting

7894.96 --> 7900.0
that

7896.599 --> 7902.599
from and yeah structured water is they

7900.0 --> 7905.559
claim or they suspect it is like a

7902.599 --> 7905.559
fourth state of

7906.679 --> 7911.52
water which is really weird when you

7909.52 --> 7913.92
think about it but there's something

7911.52 --> 7916.159000000001
about it it's just something that needs

7913.92 --> 7920.119
to be researched

7916.159 --> 7924.28
further but all the right

7920.119 --> 7924.28
people are like onto

7927.199 --> 7932.799999999999
that so

7930.119 --> 7935.079
yeah where am getting structured water

7932.8 --> 7936.8
from well just watch that video that I

7935.079 --> 7941.36
just posted a link

7936.8 --> 7944.4800000000005
of and and it'll tell you like we got

7941.36 --> 7944.48
structured water in

7947.88 --> 7954.400000000001
US you distill your water you lose the

7950.44 --> 7954.4
salt yeah this that's not what this is

7955.76 --> 7960.360000000001
about and yeah if you do that that's

7959.119 --> 7963.28
your

7960.36 --> 7965.92
business I mean I filter water too but I

7963.28 --> 7970.119
don't distill

7965.92 --> 7972.4
it I just use ceramic filters works

7970.119 --> 7975.558999999999
brilliantly but more importantly I

7972.4 --> 7975.558999999999
energize all my

7982.0 --> 7988.96
water water is like this

7984.4 --> 7992.92
Soul or soul is your soul is like

7988.96 --> 7992.92
water it's a whole matter of

7994.04 --> 7999.36
perspective

7996.28 --> 8001.4
right but uh yeah it's 4:00 I think I'm

7999.36 --> 8004.5199999999995
going to round out the show before it

8001.4 --> 8004.5199999999995
gets all dark here

8007.4 --> 8011.4
again right so yeah if you haven't

8009.52 --> 8014.599
already make sure to check out the video

8011.4 --> 8014.598999999999
that just post a link

8016.48 --> 8023.32
off and you like check out Greg Reese in

8020.159 --> 8025.36
general like he's he's got great videos

8023.32 --> 8029.079
and he's like becoming better and better

8025.36 --> 8031.4
over the years I mean it is mindblowing

8029.079 --> 8034.48
the quality level that's coming out of

8031.4 --> 8037.879999999999
him is like shocking to

8034.48 --> 8040.678999999999
me I at this point I can say like I've

8037.88 --> 8043.28
he's probably the most competent video

8040.679 --> 8045.36
maker I've ever come

8043.28 --> 8049.5199999999995
across right there's people can make

8045.36 --> 8052.679
great videos but this guy is also really

8049.52 --> 8056.76
smart and really like at the tip of the

8052.679 --> 8060.119
Spear of actual Advanced knowledge of

8056.76 --> 8063.119000000001
this age he's really there he's really

8060.119 --> 8066.04
getting it and like and a good video

8063.119 --> 8066.04
maker I mean what a

8070.4 --> 8078.719
comie oh may you water vortex car off

8075.0 --> 8078.719
that's a thing that's

8081.84 --> 8086.4800000000005
interesting yes that is the link I Shar

8084.28 --> 8088.159
it's just one Link in the chat here and

8086.48 --> 8092.0
that's that link that I'm talking about

8088.159 --> 8093.558999999999
a link to a article that has the

8092.0 --> 8097.119
video

8093.559 --> 8100.0
about the human heart or the hearts in

8097.119 --> 8102.598999999999
general what it is and how structured

8100.0 --> 8105.04
water has something to do with that and

8102.599 --> 8107.079
there's another video by this by also by

8105.04 --> 8109.599
gregories about water that's

8107.079 --> 8111.679
specifically about this structured water

8109.599 --> 8113.360000000001
it's the video before the Heart video

8111.679 --> 8115.84
but just look at the Heart video and

8113.36 --> 8119.04
just have your mind blown because when

8115.84 --> 8121.04
you look at it it's just like holy [ __ ]

8119.04 --> 8125.8
everything we were been taught is just

8121.04 --> 8125.8
completely inside out it's

8125.92 --> 8129.88
bizarre

8127.44 --> 8132.678999999999
like our understanding of how things

8129.88 --> 8134.84
Works has literally been turned inside

8132.679 --> 8138.0
out like

8134.84 --> 8141.079
provably and this video really shows

8138.0 --> 8141.079
that it's

8143.079 --> 8152.639
amazing can send a May link uh sure why

8149.599 --> 8155.1990000000005
not at least for taking a look slowmo

8152.639 --> 8155.1990000000005
that sounds

8163.88 --> 8166.88
interesting

8167.52 --> 8172.040000000001
right anyway over two hours and 15

8171.0 --> 8175.44
minutes

8172.04 --> 8177.88
already right I am going to round out

8175.44 --> 8178.638999999999
though it's been a nice show bit longer

8177.88 --> 8181.400000000001
than

8178.639 --> 8185.32
usual hope you all enjoyed

8181.4 --> 8185.32
it I had a lot of fun

8185.559 --> 8191.12
here today was not so much an angry show

8189.159 --> 8193.479
thank

8191.12 --> 8195.319
God but I mean yeah I did have like a

8193.479 --> 8197.08
great Christmas dinner here and

8195.319 --> 8200.84
yesterday and it

8197.08 --> 8200.84

8201.679 --> 8207.12
me

8203.599 --> 8209.16
what no that's why are you posting my

8207.12 --> 8213.04
link

8209.16 --> 8213.039999999999
slowmo that's my Infowars

8225.04 --> 8231.76
link all right anyway I am rounding out

8227.84 --> 8235.319
the show I'll still yeah wait for the

8231.76 --> 8235.319
link is let me

8235.8 --> 8241.679
see structured water

8239.399 --> 8241.679
that's

8249.049 --> 8252.080000000002
[Music]

8250.16 --> 8254.8
interesting whoa that's kind of

8252.08 --> 8254.8
expensive

8257.719 --> 8262.8
though fascinating though very

8264.08 --> 8269.599
interesting I'd love to have one of

8266.599 --> 8269.599
those

8278.0 --> 8281.28
because also I'd love to compare it like

8279.96 --> 8284.479
with my

8281.28 --> 8287.359
Pizer but I think the Pizer that I use

8284.479 --> 8289.84
actually does already do

8287.359 --> 8293.04
that it's just a little stick that you

8289.84 --> 8293.04
put in the water that's

8296.519 --> 8299.519
it

8303.719 --> 8308.719
right but I'd love to have one of those

8305.319 --> 8312.0
things that would be pretty

8308.719 --> 8314.16
amazing right anyway thanks everyone for

8312.0 --> 8316.719

8314.16 --> 8320.639
