84.159 --> 90.47900000000001
and there's not a lot of wind it's yeah

87.36 --> 91.119
it's slightly different every time it's

90.479 --> 94.159
just

91.119 --> 98.0
wet and dreary and

94.159 --> 100.799
cold so

98.0 --> 101.52
i got a kind of early today even though

100.799 --> 104.88000000000001
i did go

101.52 --> 107.439
up i stayed up pretty late

104.88 --> 108.15899999999999
but this time despite that despite

107.439 --> 111.67999999999999
getting up

108.159 --> 115.759
like before 12 o'clock was it

111.68 --> 119.119
11 o'clock even i'm still late so

115.759 --> 123.04
timing it's it's very puzzling sometimes

119.119 --> 125.2
but anyway i'm here i got green tea with

153.2 --> 156.48
i don't know my stomach is a little

154.56 --> 158.0
upset today

156.48 --> 161.28
it was already getting a bit upset

158.0 --> 164.319
yesterday so maybe it's like the

161.28 --> 164.319
the dinner i had

164.48 --> 168.599
it's like this certain type of yeah it

167.12 --> 172.31900000000002
is pre

168.599 --> 175.35999999999999
prefabricated soup but organic

172.319 --> 177.67999999999998
and i don't know i've had it before

175.36 --> 180.4
like last year was pretty good but now i

177.68 --> 185.84
don't know maybe it's the weather change

180.4 --> 185.84
it's like um

186.8 --> 193.28
maybe it's just the cold season

190.239 --> 195.12
starting to nag at me again but i don't

193.28 --> 200.319
really have a call or anything but

195.12 --> 200.31900000000002

[Music]

210.84 --> 219.12

gofundme tour in australia what

219.12 --> 227.84
no idea

230.799 --> 235.84
so he wants a vacation to australia does

233.68 --> 235.84
he

236.4 --> 245.84
yeah i can imagine with this weather

241.76 --> 249.519
how are things in the netherlands well

245.84 --> 253.04
okay i guess bit dreary

249.519 --> 253.36
i was very agitated maybe that's why it

253.04 --> 256.639
is

253.36 --> 257.44
although yeah today slightly different

256.639 --> 260.479
but

257.44 --> 263.44
it seems like uh in the netherlands

260.479 --> 264.08
and also on utrecht they've opted like

263.44 --> 267.12
the

264.08 --> 269.12
covet alert and so

267.12 --> 271.6
yesterday when i went out for groceries

269.12 --> 274.24
after the flat earth debate

271.6 --> 276.16
i was unpleasantly surprised by seeing

274.24 --> 278.639
everybody in the supermarket that i

276.16 --> 280.8
always go to the organic supermarket

278.639 --> 282.0
them wearing all masks and i was like oh

280.8 --> 286.88
no oh

282.0 --> 290.0
no that's not good

286.88 --> 292.08
but yeah at least i don't i

290.0 --> 295.28
they don't demand anybody else wear a

292.08 --> 298.71999999999997
mask that goes to the store at least

295.28 --> 302.15999999999997
and uh

298.72 --> 304.16
yeah today somebody was also working

302.16 --> 307.28000000000003
there that wasn't wearing a mask so i

304.16 --> 310.0
i guess you can have exemptions for it

307.28 --> 311.75899999999996
that's yeah but i'm still not happy that

310.0 --> 313.36
it forwarded after everything that's

311.759 --> 316.56
come out it's like

313.36 --> 318.47900000000004
no not even a small step forward this

316.56 --> 321.039
shouldn't be happening i'm i was just

318.479 --> 323.44
very pissed off about it and uh

321.039 --> 324.96
i think good servant got the full wind

323.44 --> 327.44
of that

324.96 --> 330.08
as he caught me yesterday being quite

327.44 --> 330.08
ragey

333.039 --> 340.479
alright you know oh trump

336.8 --> 344.08
has got the cold and was all

340.479 --> 347.52
scary like oh everybody's so scared

344.08 --> 347.52
about trump getting a cold

350.84 --> 353.84
ugh

355.68 --> 360.24
yeah flat shandy yeah thanks for all the

357.919 --> 363.52
advertisement for randy but i don't

360.24 --> 363.52
i'm not even subscribed

363.6 --> 367.84000000000003
i really follow him

370.319 --> 377.76
hey reggie benneke it's been a while

374.7 --> 377.76
[Music]

378.4 --> 382.71999999999997
oh yeah and martin tolberg good to see

380.56 --> 382.72
you

383.12 --> 386.699
[Music]

391.68 --> 395.84000000000003
what what

396.08 --> 399.28
what are you on to neil

400.56 --> 404.88
though you thought you had figured it

402.88 --> 409.84
out now you're lost so what

404.88 --> 409.84
what exactly

411.84 --> 415.75899999999996
yeah martin tolbert it's because the

413.599 --> 418.15999999999997
cold season and this stupid

415.759 --> 419.759
this spell this whole covet spell and

418.16 --> 423.52000000000004
the lockdowns and the masks

419.759 --> 425.199
[ __ ] it has basically polluted our

423.52 --> 428.31899999999996
general understanding of

425.199 --> 431.28000000000003
people getting colds it has

428.319 --> 432.96000000000004
yeah the spell has kind of ruined it so

431.28 --> 434.88
now every time the coal scenes

432.96 --> 437.599
season is arriving as long as these

434.88 --> 441.36
people are allowed to do what they do

437.599 --> 445.28
in government and in corporations

441.36 --> 450.319
yeah every cold season like opportunity

445.28 --> 453.52
it's just going to be more covet panic

450.319 --> 453.52000000000004
they brainwashed it

453.599 --> 457.599
all our general knowledge of how to deal

455.68 --> 460.08
with colds

457.599 --> 462.96
are now subtly overwritten by this

460.08 --> 465.84
narrative spell

462.96 --> 465.84
it's not good

468.96 --> 472.87899999999996
especially because people are getting

470.72 --> 474.72
very pushy now

472.879 --> 476.8
compared to before when it's just oh you

474.72 --> 478.639
have a cold okay just

476.8 --> 480.879
it's natural like oh somebody has a call

478.639 --> 483.36
okay you don't give them a hand after

480.879 --> 486.08000000000004
they just sneeze or something

483.36 --> 487.599
and maybe stay a little away that's it

486.08 --> 490.87899999999996
that's normal

487.599 --> 493.28
but now because of this [ __ ] there's

490.879 --> 495.44
just going to be people that have pushy

493.28 --> 497.919
tendencies about it

495.44 --> 501.199
that are going to try to dictate what

497.919 --> 503.35999999999996
the narrative has dictated to them

501.199 --> 505.599
and they're going to try to pull push

503.36 --> 508.47900000000004
that spell onto others

505.599 --> 509.039
and that's annoying now i haven't had

508.479 --> 511.35999999999996
that

509.039 --> 512.64
so far but still i had to hear stories

511.36 --> 515.039
from people basically

512.64 --> 518.479
complaining like oh it's gotten worse

515.039 --> 521.039
now we'll get through it and just like

518.479 --> 521.599
dude there's literally nothing it's

521.039 --> 524.48
nothing

521.599 --> 525.12
but if i say that they'll get pissed off

524.48 --> 528.08
you know

525.12 --> 528.08
they don't accept it

531.2 --> 535.519
like i think most people don't think

533.68 --> 538.7199999999999
it's really that bad but they still

535.519 --> 543.12
accept this [ __ ]

538.72 --> 543.12
these insane measures

544.24 --> 549.839
that are completely nonsensical uh

550.88 --> 554.72
hey hello again mr jones

560.839 --> 563.839
ah

568.48 --> 577.839
all right all right

583.2 --> 587.2
there's just an ambulance arriving there

586.08 --> 591.519
i don't see that

587.2 --> 593.6
very often

591.519 --> 605.279
there's nothing in a hurry though but

593.6 --> 608.48
still weird

605.279 --> 611.279
see way over there

608.48 --> 611.279
yeah in the back

613.68 --> 622.2399999999999
don't know what they're doing

619.36 --> 622.24
hey what's this

622.88 --> 625.8389999999999
whoa that was weird

626.0 --> 633.839
did you see that camera getting all dark

628.88 --> 633.8389999999999
that was odd

648.0 --> 651.36
yeah mr jones oh i could do better i

650.8 --> 654.64
think

651.36 --> 654.64
the weather yeah

657.04 --> 664.16
but yeah feeling pretty strong

660.64 --> 664.16
yesterday was a good show

665.279 --> 675.76
that i was very good on the flat earth

667.44 --> 679.519
debates as well i thought

675.76 --> 679.519
yeah and it's just really good to

679.6 --> 685.6
to see nathan like having fun again like

683.44 --> 688.0790000000001
he found a really good new bone

685.6 --> 690.48
like a dog that's just really

688.079 --> 694.079
enthusiastic about finding a new bone

690.48 --> 697.839
in this case simon dan telling

694.079 --> 700.4799999999999
us that our reference frames are ruined

697.839 --> 702.1600000000001
and he's he's just going in full frenzy

700.48 --> 705.12
about it

702.16 --> 705.12
it's just good to see

707.839 --> 713.0400000000001
yeah that's i don't care i did and i'm

710.959 --> 717.8389999999999
part of it i'm part of oakley's

713.04 --> 717.8389999999999
show so i was there

739.279 --> 745.8389999999999
okay martin tolberg i don't get it

757.44 --> 773.839
oh i get that it was supposed to be a

759.519 --> 773.839
joke i just don't get the joke

779.44 --> 783.36
but technically time doesn't do anything

781.92 --> 787.8389999999999
it's just a concept

783.36 --> 787.839
it's a derivative

794.56 --> 797.68
so technically time doesn't move in one

796.8 --> 800.8
direction

797.68 --> 804.079
it's rather that entropy

800.8 --> 804.079
moves in one direction

804.56 --> 811.279
and entropy always works

808.079 --> 811.279
throughout time

813.6 --> 819.12
no time is a concept it's not a tangible

816.88 --> 819.12
thing

819.279 --> 822.399
it's not scientific

822.639 --> 826.72
time doesn't cause anything

826.959 --> 830.2399999999999
but you could consider that it's the

828.88 --> 832.24
cause of everything

830.24 --> 834.75
and therefore it's yeah it's not

832.24 --> 837.809
scientific

834.75 --> 837.809
[Music]

839.04 --> 843.8389999999999
hey emmanuel good to see you

844.44 --> 847.5290000000001
[Music]

852.32 --> 858.1600000000001
well mr jones if you break your clocks

854.639 --> 861.519
in your house then time won't affect you

858.16 --> 864.56
psychologically unless you start to

861.519 --> 867.04
worry about not knowing the time

864.56 --> 869.199
but if the concept of time eludes your

867.04 --> 870.88
consciousness then it doesn't affect you

869.199 --> 873.04
really

870.88 --> 874.16
on that level at least of course your

873.04 --> 877.4399999999999
body is still going to be

874.16 --> 881.12
subjected to entropy so by that

877.44 --> 885.839
manner you will eventually notice

881.12 --> 885.839
the passage of time through entropy

893.839 --> 897.6800000000001
it's funny that you mention it if you

895.519 --> 899.36
don't think about time you want age

897.68 --> 900.7199999999999
well there might actually be something

899.36 --> 902.839
to that

900.72 --> 905.839
there might be something to it

902.839 --> 905.839
psychosomatically

907.44 --> 911.9200000000001
because if you're constantly telling

909.44 --> 914.0
yourself that you're old or that you're

911.92 --> 916.8
growing old

914.0 --> 917.68
i i believe that it's more likely that

916.8 --> 920.079
your body will

917.68 --> 921.279
adapt to that mindset and actually

920.079 --> 923.76
create that

921.279 --> 927.8389999999999
work towards the projection that you're

923.76 --> 927.8389999999999
projecting onto yourself

929.04 --> 934.16
i know it's always you're always trying

931.36 --> 938.24
to get some trick question out of it but

934.16 --> 941.8389999999999
yeah sometimes trick questions aren't

938.24 --> 941.839
really trick questions

953.759 --> 969.839
ah okay martin talbert that's

958.32 --> 972.0
that's funny

969.839 --> 973.36
yeah well i didn't say that you can

972.0 --> 976.639
completely negate

973.36 --> 980.0
entropy nothing can

976.639 --> 980.0
but you could influence it

980.959 --> 986.0
and hey you have to have the spirit and

983.839 --> 989.2790000000001
the mind

986.0 --> 992.399
in order to do that so non

989.279 --> 997.8389999999999
or barely conscious creatures

992.399 --> 1001.12
won't have a mindset to alter

997.839 --> 1001.12
their being like that

1002.8 --> 1011.04
so yeah but i don't know why

1007.04 --> 1014.639
oh god oh god this is what

1011.04 --> 1016.24
look mr jones it's been fun and all you

1014.639 --> 1019.12
know in the last week but this

1016.24 --> 1021.199
level you know it this is this is just

1019.12 --> 1023.6
like

1021.199 --> 1025.039
freaking p mars or [ __ ] you know at this

1023.6 --> 1027.439
point you could just be p

1025.039 --> 1027.439
mars

1028.88 --> 1032.72
now what am i saying p mars would not

1031.839 --> 1035.9189999999999
say

1032.72 --> 1036.319
stupid things to that level he would

1035.919 --> 1039.679
just

1036.319 --> 1042.0
squ double down squirt on

1039.679 --> 1044.4
his ball conception but he wouldn't say

1042.0 --> 1047.439
something as stupid as that

1044.4 --> 1048.4
it's ridiculous entropy has nothing to

1047.439 --> 1051.679
do with time

1048.4 --> 1054.48
no of course not you don't know what

1051.679 --> 1054.48
entropy is

1055.36 --> 1067.84
if there was no entropy there would be

1057.6 --> 1067.84
no way to even conceive of time

1074.03 --> 1080.08
[Music]

1076.88 --> 1083.6000000000001
yeah i'm sure you got a a

1080.08 --> 1086.799
description of entropy entropy

1083.6 --> 1091.6
is a lot of things it's

1086.799 --> 1091.6
cornerstone in natural law it's in

1092.84 --> 1095.84
everything

1097.039 --> 1104.16
it's how things change no entropy

1100.64 --> 1107.3600000000001
no change no change

1104.16 --> 1109.8400000000001
no way to even conceive of the passage

1107.36 --> 1109.84
of time

1124.559 --> 1128.72
yeah i know a systems thermal energy see

1127.52 --> 1132.48
yeah

1128.72 --> 1133.52
that's very nice it's already proving by

1132.48 --> 1137.28
that statement

1133.52 --> 1140.0
that it's you've literally found

1137.28 --> 1141.28
something out there that addresses a

1140.0 --> 1144.08
specific

1141.28 --> 1145.36
thing that involves entropy as i said as

1144.08 --> 1148.559
i would predict

1145.36 --> 1152.24
i'm just getting sick of just calling

1148.559 --> 1155.44
it every single time you know

1152.24 --> 1158.88
you're getting too predictable for me

1155.44 --> 1158.88
it's kind of getting boring

1159.76 --> 1181.28
you're not a challenge um

1179.28 --> 1185.2
now you have to go again amanda young

1181.28 --> 1192.72
you seem to be very busy these days

1185.2 --> 1195.829
anyway good to see you in chat again

1192.72 --> 1195.829
[Music]

1200.68 --> 1203.749
[Music]

1208.48 --> 1212.72
you're healing oh

1213.76 --> 1221.84
you're sick okay i'll get back

1216.96 --> 1221.8400000000001
get better soon then

1227.679 --> 1232.5590000000002
i can talk what no mention of time there

1230.799 --> 1235.2
jones how would you know you don't even

1232.559 --> 1237.12
know what he's

1235.2 --> 1239.76
yeah what what he's paraphrasing what

1237.12 --> 1239.76
he's quoting

1242.08 --> 1245.6
you know the amount the amount of things

1244.799 --> 1248.6399999999999
that involve

1245.6 --> 1251.76
entropy are like a lot

1248.64 --> 1255.1200000000001
so it's very nice he found a specific

1251.76 --> 1259.12
paragraph something somewhere

1255.12 --> 1261.76
that yeah this ascribes entropy to that

1259.12 --> 1263.1999999999998
thing systems thermal energy blah blah

1261.76 --> 1264.559
unit

1263.2 --> 1276.24
yeah that's not the only thing it

1264.559 --> 1279.28
applies to

1276.24 --> 1282.4
entropy requires time to work

1279.28 --> 1284.6399999999999
well not really entropy just works and

1282.4 --> 1288.64
we can use it to deduce

1284.64 --> 1291.679
time because time

1288.64 --> 1295.5200000000002
cannot be excluded in order to

1291.679 --> 1298.3200000000002
halt entropy time is always there

1295.52 --> 1300.0
so so to imagine that without time

1298.32 --> 1303.28
entropy wouldn't work this is a nice

1300.0 --> 1307.2
science fiction imagination but

1303.28 --> 1309.84
it's unfalsifiable because time

1307.2 --> 1312.559
the effect and entropy they're

1309.84 --> 1316.32
intertwined they're always together

1312.559 --> 1319.039
without time we wouldn't have entropy

1316.32 --> 1322.3999999999999
without entropy we wouldn't have a

1319.039 --> 1322.4
realization of time

1326.88 --> 1333.8400000000001
or a conception of time so

1371.919 --> 1375.5200000000002
i don't know good servant i don't think

1373.679 --> 1376.3200000000002
he's a sheep he's just a bona fide

1375.52 --> 1379.44
glober

1376.32 --> 1379.4399999999998
a religious zealot

1382.32 --> 1389.8799999999999
a a self-proclaimed priest that thinks

1386.559 --> 1392.0
he's on a mission to get all the

1389.88 --> 1394.0
misunderstandings about flat earth out

1392.0 --> 1397.039
of the way and to believe that

1394.0 --> 1400.84
yeah to spread his knowledge of

1397.039 --> 1402.96
his truth about the earth being a globe

1400.84 --> 1406.799
excluding

1402.96 --> 1409.44
all the things that is excluded in his

1406.799 --> 1409.84
conceptions in the rebuttals and all

1409.44 --> 1417.8400000000001
that

1409.84 --> 1417.84
yeah you are is exactly what you are

1426.159 --> 1430.3200000000002
for all the discussions we've had here

1428.08 --> 1433.52
in chat mr jones

1430.32 --> 1436.559
you've not adapted to a single

1433.52 --> 1440.799
conclusion that was drawn

1436.559 --> 1443.12
based on extensive argumentation

1440.799 --> 1444.799
you've just ignored it like a baller

1443.12 --> 1448.1589999999999
moved on to another subject

1444.799 --> 1450.32
immediately to not let it sink in to not

1448.159 --> 1451.279
break the suspense of disbelief on your

1450.32 --> 1455.84
side that you're

1451.279 --> 1458.72
actually yeah

1455.84 --> 1459.12
because you think you're on the right

1458.72 --> 1461.1200000000001
side

1459.12 --> 1462.799
and we prove you're not and then you

1461.12 --> 1465.36
ignore that proof

1462.799 --> 1473.84
to move on and prevent the breaking of

1465.36 --> 1473.84
the suspense of disbelief

1475.57 --> 1480.1399999999999
[Music]

1490.88 --> 1497.5200000000002
oh yeah yeah i have mr jones

1494.32 --> 1501.52
relative density theory

1497.52 --> 1506.6399999999999
yes absolutely held up to scientific

1501.52 --> 1510.559
scrutiny it's a repeatable experiment

1506.64 --> 1512.48
and even people can refig reconfigure

1510.559 --> 1514.8799999999999
those experiments to test

1512.48 --> 1519.039
other elements about it and it will hold

1514.88 --> 1521.2
up because it's scientifically valid

1519.039 --> 1522.4
relative density theory that's what i

1521.2 --> 1525.44
offered

1522.4 --> 1528.1200000000001
and it's definitely been scrutinized

1525.44 --> 1530.159
and validated through hypothesis and

1528.12 --> 1533.6
experimentation

1530.159 --> 1536.96
as should anything that

1533.6 --> 1543.84
that is claiming to be science

1536.96 --> 1543.8400000000001
so wrong mr jones

1556.24 --> 1561.6
oh mark color that's all fine and dandy

1558.48 --> 1561.919
but hey relative density can absolutely

1561.6 --> 1564.9599999999998
be

1561.919 --> 1565.76
expressed in equations can even be

1564.96 --> 1567.52
measured out

1565.76 --> 1570.0
in the forces and all that [ __ ] i just

1567.52 --> 1573.12
never really gotten to

1570.0 --> 1576.799
building a like a module for that

1573.12 --> 1580.4799999999998
i could probably in what is it

1576.799 --> 1583.679
in this databasing program

1580.48 --> 1587.76
what is that you call that again

1583.679 --> 1590.5590000000002
anyway i could try to build something

1587.76 --> 1593.039
like that it's just that

1590.559 --> 1595.9189999999999
i'm not so interested in formulas and

1593.039 --> 1599.039
numbers and trying to create an emulator

1595.919 --> 1602.159
for it i'm just not that interested

1599.039 --> 1605.039
because it's just apparent

1602.159 --> 1605.0390000000002
how it works

1607.919 --> 1613.039
everyone has validated relative density

1610.96 --> 1616.0
everyone that's going to try it

1613.039 --> 1616.0
will validate it

1621.76 --> 1627.36
or is the equation for weight

1624.88 --> 1627.919
well i've described exactly what weight

1627.36 --> 1632.32
is

1627.919 --> 1633.76
exactly exactly i've probably outlined

1632.32 --> 1636.1589999999999
the specifics of

1633.76 --> 1638.399
what weight is where it comes from how

1636.159 --> 1641.5200000000002
it's been established

1638.399 --> 1643.36
what it really does how it changes

1641.52 --> 1645.039
depending on circumstances i've

1643.36 --> 1647.6789999999999
explained it in utter

1645.039 --> 1647.679
detail

1648.799 --> 1653.76
and yet i might have not put that into

1651.679 --> 1657.279
some calculus formula

1653.76 --> 1660.48
but i've absolutely defined it

1657.279 --> 1660.48
to the nth level

1661.919 --> 1669.8400000000001
if you want to make a formula of it you

1664.159 --> 1669.8400000000001
do it

1670.46 --> 1673.609
[Music]

1673.919 --> 1678.64
what gives things weight relative

1676.88 --> 1683.8400000000001
density this equilibrium

1678.64 --> 1683.8400000000001
gives things weight

1684.0 --> 1688.559
if the relative density this equilibrium

1686.88 --> 1690.48
is in a specific direction

1688.559 --> 1692.8799999999999
and that depends on well the relative

1690.48 --> 1697.84
density of the object versus the

1692.88 --> 1697.8400000000001
surrounding versus the medium

1698.159 --> 1703.679
and then the pressure caused by the

1700.679 --> 1703.679
disequilibrium

1704.08 --> 1707.84
right when it's not moving can be

1706.64 --> 1711.6000000000001
translated

1707.84 --> 1713.279
and it

1711.6 --> 1716.6399999999999
[Music]

1713.279 --> 1718.159
basically multi yeah you take the entire

1716.64 --> 1720.72
amount of pressure

1718.159 --> 1721.6000000000001
and then you divide that up by the

1720.72 --> 1724.159
density

1721.6 --> 1724.6399999999999
of the material and then you get the

1724.159 --> 1726.5590000000002
weight

1724.64 --> 1728.64
and that weight is effectively air

1726.559 --> 1731.2
weight because it's always anchored

1728.64 --> 1733.679
general weight is anchored in an air

1731.2 --> 1736.96
medium

1733.679 --> 1740.24
general ground level

1736.96 --> 1742.96
air pressure medium that's that's weight

1740.24 --> 1745.2
that's the convention of weight relative

1742.96 --> 1750.64
density this equilibrium

1745.2 --> 1750.64
in a ground level air pressure medium

1751.44 --> 1755.1200000000001
that is what weight is but there's other

1754.0 --> 1759.36
types of weight

1755.12 --> 1761.76
as well because if you change the medium

1759.36 --> 1763.84
into water then you get water weight and

1761.76 --> 1766.8799999999999
if you change the medium

1763.84 --> 1770.6399999999999
to vacuum chamber

1766.88 --> 1770.64
then it becomes vacuum weight

1773.679 --> 1780.159
yes all things have

1776.88 --> 1783.279
weight can yeah you can derive

1780.159 --> 1786.24
the convention of weight from anything

1783.279 --> 1787.2
except there's this thing about gases

1786.24 --> 1789.679
which can be

1787.2 --> 1791.279
weighed in a vacuum chamber that's very

1789.679 --> 1793.039
nice but they can't if they're not

1791.279 --> 1796.159
contained

1793.039 --> 1797.84
within a container separate of the

1796.159 --> 1800.72
vacuum chamber that is

1797.84 --> 1803.6789999999999
being evacuated there's no container the

1800.72 --> 1805.52
gas is in to weigh it

1803.679 --> 1806.96
yeah you won't be able to wait because

1805.52 --> 1809.84
it's going to go in all directions and

1806.96 --> 1809.8400000000001
then evacuate

1809.919 --> 1814.7990000000002
because of the vacuum pump so

1816.96 --> 1823.8400000000001
eight guns of nephron rmp

1831.52 --> 1836.0
ah nathan now guess only go down go boom

1835.44 --> 1838.96
boom like

1836.0 --> 1839.44
bouncy balls in a fish tank if it is

1838.96 --> 1842.799
caught

1839.44 --> 1846.3200000000002
in bouncy balls so you can have bouncy

1842.799 --> 1846.32
balls filled with gas

1846.399 --> 1850.1589999999999
that will go down go boom boom in a

1848.84 --> 1854.399
vacuum

1850.159 --> 1857.6000000000001
but only if they are in containers

1854.399 --> 1861.1999999999998
in order for the gas to keep

1857.6 --> 1862.24
the its pressure and by keeping its

1861.2 --> 1865.6000000000001
pressure

1862.24 --> 1868.08
retain its higher level density

1865.6 --> 1870.08
as an object contained object in

1868.08 --> 1871.519
relation to the medium which is a lower

1870.08 --> 1879.84
pressure vacuum

1871.519 --> 1879.84
that's how it works

1890.84 --> 1893.84
okey-dokey

1893.919 --> 1908.96
now that's a good i know you're joking

1906.559 --> 1911.039
depends on the density of the gas no not

1908.96 --> 1914.799
really

1911.039 --> 1916.8799999999999
not really tarpon stamp in a vacuum

1914.799 --> 1920.559
chamber any gas

1916.88 --> 1922.72
when contained will

1920.559 --> 1924.399
with container and all go down go boom

1922.72 --> 1926.72
boom

1924.399 --> 1928.1589999999999
in a vacuum chamber but only when it is

1926.72 --> 1929.44
contained

1928.159 --> 1931.3600000000001
because otherwise it's going to go in

1929.44 --> 1932.159
all directions and fill up the entire

1931.36 --> 1935.84
container

1932.159 --> 1935.8400000000001
and then you're not gonna weigh it

1938.559 --> 1942.72
there is no density in a vacuum yeah

1940.399 --> 1944.08
that's right well no density or almost

1942.72 --> 1949.2
no density

1944.08 --> 1952.8799999999999
equates to very low density

1949.2 --> 1953.919
so this whole relation between densities

1952.88 --> 1957.679
in order to cause

1953.919 --> 1961.679
a disequilibrium displacement force

1957.679 --> 1965.8400000000001
is not about there has to be a

1961.679 --> 1968.799
thing here in relation to

1965.84 --> 1971.12
a thing there and if there's nothing it

1968.799 --> 1974.48
doesn't work anymore no no

1971.12 --> 1977.84
the only thing that is relevant is

1974.48 --> 1981.3600000000001
the height the amount

1977.84 --> 1983.36
of density versus the amount

1981.36 --> 1984.559
of the other density that is the only

1983.36 --> 1987.1999999999998
thing that is relevant

1984.559 --> 1988.48
in this equation doesn't matter if there

1987.2 --> 1991.8400000000001
is nothing there

1988.48 --> 1994.799
nothing just means extremely low density

1991.84 --> 1998.32
that's what it is i'm sorry if that's

1994.799 --> 1998.32
too hard for you to understand

1999.97 --> 2003.279
[Music]

2003.44 --> 2006.559
it doesn't matter whether there is very

2006.0 --> 2010.88
little

2006.559 --> 2014.6399999999999
air or no air at all more colored

2010.88 --> 2017.7600000000002
it's about the relation of the content

2014.64 --> 2018.5590000000002
versus the relation the other content

2017.76 --> 2020.559
basically that

2018.559 --> 2022.0
that's it so it doesn't matter if

2020.559 --> 2024.8799999999999
there's nothing there

2022.0 --> 2033.84
nothing just equates to very low content

2024.88 --> 2033.8400000000001

2086.839 --> 2089.839
uh

2091.04 --> 2095.44
because i don't care i don't care for

2094.0 --> 2098.8
your freaking maths

2095.44 --> 2101.839
mn because stick your maths and your

2098.8 --> 2102.32
formulas and your little models up your

2101.839 --> 2105.359
ass

2102.32 --> 2106.7200000000003
i don't give a [ __ ] you want them you

2105.359 --> 2108.88
build them

2106.72 --> 2110.16
you figure out what i'm saying i'm not

2108.88 --> 2113.839
gonna talk to you

2110.16 --> 2117.839
in maths okay

2113.839 --> 2117.839
piss off

2129.2 --> 2132.3999999999996
[Music]

2132.88 --> 2135.119
ah

2137.52 --> 2146.079
no turpin stamp i just don't care

2140.8 --> 2149.52
i don't care for your [ __ ] math

2146.079 --> 2149.52
it's conceptual

2149.76 --> 2153.76
you want to latch on to that and refine

2152.079 --> 2157.119
that into reality that's your

2153.76 --> 2160.4
damn business okay i don't care for your

2157.119 --> 2162.88
religious assertions your religious

2160.4 --> 2162.88
focus

2162.96 --> 2166.7200000000003
you want the math you build it i'm

2166.0 --> 2169.76
building

2166.72 --> 2174.0
with reality here physics

2169.76 --> 2177.2000000000003
doesn't need math okay

2174.0 --> 2181.04
scientific method doesn't need

2177.2 --> 2182.24
math okay get it through your thick

2181.04 --> 2186.0
skull

2182.24 --> 2189.04
oh by the way guns have never owned

2186.0 --> 2189.04
paypal you say

2252.72 --> 2257.4399999999996
yeah i know emman i know you're

2254.64 --> 2262.0
religious assertions with an e

2257.44 --> 2266.8
not a you dumbass

2262.0 --> 2269.52
i know they work with math

2266.8 --> 2271.119
and physics i know i know they worked i

2269.52 --> 2273.28
know you built the formulas that's why

2271.119 --> 2276.4
you use the math you love it

2273.28 --> 2279.119
i don't love it i don't care for it

2276.4 --> 2281.6800000000003
because i know what you do with it i

2279.119 --> 2285.2000000000003
know you're reifying it into reality

2281.68 --> 2287.7599999999998
i don't do that

2285.2 --> 2287.7599999999998
what's this

2290.96 --> 2294.96
oh mr jones it's just pathetic

2295.76 --> 2301.2000000000003
maybe mr jones is just jealous that

2298.4 --> 2304.2400000000002
somebody can be on the internet can be a

2301.2 --> 2308.16
teacher not be

2304.24 --> 2311.52
a religious fanatical math believer

2308.16 --> 2312.72
and global and still get money for his

2311.52 --> 2317.68
work

2312.72 --> 2317.68
is that tough for you to to bite

2318.079 --> 2323.3590000000004
you got to make fun of how i can't count

2321.28 --> 2326.079
now how i don't understand numbers

2323.359 --> 2329.119
anymore because i refuse to talk in

2326.079 --> 2329.119
math language

2336.8 --> 2341.2000000000003
right well martin tolberg that's the

2338.24 --> 2344.4799999999996
thing about math if you like math

2341.2 --> 2344.48
then you build the math

2344.96 --> 2348.32
you don't go out and demand from other

2347.359 --> 2355.839
people

2348.32 --> 2355.839
that they talk in math it's ridiculous

2366.8 --> 2371.2000000000003
whoa okay mark collard that's heavy

2372.16 --> 2375.52
yeah that's really nice for you i'm glad

2374.56 --> 2379.2799999999997
you got a

2375.52 --> 2381.44
job it helps you squirt over your

2379.28 --> 2382.6400000000003
religion that's really nice for you i'm

2381.44 --> 2385.119
glad you're

2382.64 --> 2386.4
you've found a good place to drown

2385.119 --> 2388.48
yourself in math

2386.4 --> 2389.76
and make some money from it too i'm very

2388.48 --> 2394.0
happy for you

2389.76 --> 2394.0
can you stop bothering me about it now

2394.839 --> 2400.64
uh yeah as for more colored

2397.68 --> 2400.64
that's very tough

2401.04 --> 2406.48
yeah dude anybody that's

2404.16 --> 2408.319
lost you say if you're going to use that

2406.48 --> 2411.359
word on top of things

2408.319 --> 2413.119
lost on drugs and won't take any help

2411.359 --> 2415.2799999999997
there's nothing you can really do about

2413.119 --> 2415.28
it

2418.56 --> 2423.599
you know i've always felt that people

2422.4 --> 2427.92
that are in that state

2423.599 --> 2431.04
are very similar to like what happens

2427.92 --> 2434.079
when for example a girl you're with just

2431.04 --> 2437.359
really decides in that

2434.079 --> 2439.6800000000003
not just being squirty or anything but

2437.359 --> 2440.88
decides that they're going to break up

2439.68 --> 2445.52
that it's final

2440.88 --> 2445.52
you know you can't change their minds

2446.319 --> 2452.88
or it's not worth it and when people

2449.76 --> 2455.119
basically retract like

2452.88 --> 2456.96
into the drugs they're escaping and it's

2455.119 --> 2458.88
not strange especially that you would

2456.96 --> 2461.599
bring it up now because now is typically

2458.88 --> 2463.6800000000003
the time to dive back into the escapism

2461.599 --> 2467.119
because there's all this extra

2463.68 --> 2469.2799999999997
pressure in the air not literally with

2467.119 --> 2471.76
the spiritual pressure

2469.28 --> 2473.76
and the the receding of the light at

2471.76 --> 2477.6800000000003
least in the north

2473.76 --> 2479.119
of the realm but yeah there's nothing

2477.68 --> 2482.0789999999997
really you can do about it

2479.119 --> 2483.04
but i don't know there's a few things

2482.079 --> 2485.6800000000003
you could try

2483.04 --> 2487.119
depending on yeah what you have you

2485.68 --> 2489.04
could just

2487.119 --> 2490.96
try to make sure they don't accidentally

2489.04 --> 2494.079
hurt themselves

2490.96 --> 2497.359
if that is a risk factor that they don't

2494.079 --> 2501.52
overdose or anything uh

2497.359 --> 2504.48
or yeah what is the best

2501.52 --> 2504.96
course of action in general that's why i

2504.48 --> 2507.2
don't

2504.96 --> 2508.0
make friends with people that are on

2507.2 --> 2511.839
hard drugs i

2508.0 --> 2513.76
always like literally

2511.839 --> 2516.24
feel bad about it but just avoid it it's

2513.76 --> 2518.96
like no i just don't do that

2516.24 --> 2520.3999999999996
no matter how interesting they seem

2518.96 --> 2523.44
that's why i avoided

2520.4 --> 2528.8
hard drugs like the freaking plague

2523.44 --> 2531.52
like suicide avoided it absolutely

2528.8 --> 2532.4
because i can never afford to become

2531.52 --> 2536.64
like that

2532.4 --> 2539.44
ever already enough trouble as it is

2536.64 --> 2540.96
so what i would do but yeah you don't

2539.44 --> 2542.48
have to take that advice i don't know

2540.96 --> 2544.16
exactly who you're referring to of

2542.48 --> 2546.0
course

2544.16 --> 2547.359
especially if you knew them before they

2546.0 --> 2550.64
were on drugs then it's

2547.359 --> 2554.56
extra tough but the best thing

2550.64 --> 2554.56
is to just not be hurt by it

2555.17 --> 2558.2490000000003
[Music]

2561.04 --> 2564.24
right friendship became before the

2563.2 --> 2566.16
problems yeah that's

2564.24 --> 2567.7599999999998
extra tough well the best thing it's

2566.16 --> 2569.839
like a breakup

2567.76 --> 2571.44
if you see it like a breakup like you

2569.839 --> 2575.04
have to just

2571.44 --> 2577.359
let them it's nothing you can do

2575.04 --> 2578.079
well you can do something and that is

2577.359 --> 2581.2
actively

2578.079 --> 2581.2000000000003
work on letting it go

2581.92 --> 2586.079
not saying you should like completely

2586.319 --> 2592.4
ignore them forever but get to

2589.599 --> 2593.76
get yourself maneuver your relation to

2592.4 --> 2595.6800000000003
him to a point

2593.76 --> 2598.3190000000004
where it's not gonna hurt you anymore

2595.68 --> 2600.8799999999997
that he's doing that

2598.319 --> 2603.68
because it's his choice he's the one

2600.88 --> 2606.88
that decided to go there

2603.68 --> 2608.72
you cannot make that hurt you

2606.88 --> 2610.4
it's already hurting him don't make it

2608.72 --> 2613.5989999999997
hurt you

2610.4 --> 2616.7200000000003
so that's my advice

2613.599 --> 2616.7200000000003
it's gonna be tough though

2619.2 --> 2622.24
otherwise they're just going to suck

2621.599 --> 2625.92
suck you

2622.24 --> 2625.9199999999996
in their problems constantly

2626.8 --> 2631.6800000000003
even if they don't talk about it

2628.16 --> 2631.68
constantly it's very important

2631.92 --> 2636.2400000000002
that you may ensure that what they're

2634.24 --> 2638.64
doing that hurts them doesn't hurt you

2636.24 --> 2638.64
as well

2646.64 --> 2649.839
visually sick

2652.8 --> 2657.52
or if he's like really physically

2655.119 --> 2660.2400000000002
degenerated severely

2657.52 --> 2662.8
you could always just try to pump some

2660.24 --> 2666.0789999999997
restoration program into him like

2662.8 --> 2668.319
get him some specific supplements yeah

2666.079 --> 2670.079
there's restoration programs for that it

2668.319 --> 2671.7599999999998
all depends on what types of drugs he's

2670.079 --> 2673.52
taking you know whether he's on heroin

2671.76 --> 2677.8390000000004
or

2673.52 --> 2677.839
what is it heavy

2680.079 --> 2686.96
heavy meth that's like those physical

2683.119 --> 2686.96
degenerating states it depends

2687.04 --> 2693.44
so cocaine

2690.16 --> 2695.2
i don't know cocaine

2693.44 --> 2696.7200000000003
cocaine doesn't really physically

2695.2 --> 2699.4399999999996
degenerate you

2696.72 --> 2701.68
this visually as much as it just

2699.44 --> 2705.76
destroys your organs and makes you risk

2701.68 --> 2708.3999999999996
extreme heart attacks and all that

2705.76 --> 2708.4
eventually

2709.119 --> 2714.319
the cocaine is not such a visually

2711.92 --> 2719.839
degenerating drug overall

2714.319 --> 2719.839
meth and heroin do that a lot more

2726.24 --> 2733.839
yeah don't do it it's not worth it not

2728.64 --> 2733.839
even the single try it's not worth it

2740.88 --> 2746.1600000000003
you know if somebody would want to try

2743.2 --> 2749.7599999999998
like raw coca leaf or anything you know

2746.16 --> 2753.04
okay i get that that's not

2749.76 --> 2755.3590000000004
even close to what real cocaine is like

2753.04 --> 2757.7599999999998
you can still get addicted to the leaf

2755.359 --> 2761.839
but it's very different it's not as

2757.76 --> 2761.8390000000004
bad for the bodies not as aggressive

2762.56 --> 2768.56
so but yeah the

2766.079 --> 2769.52
the real refined hard drugs and all it's

2768.56 --> 2775.839
all just

2769.52 --> 2775.839
super dangerous

2780.8 --> 2784.8
you can actually take opioids for

2783.119 --> 2786.0
decades and it won't kill you yeah but

2784.8 --> 2788.4
it will damn well

2786.0 --> 2791.2
change you agm it will change your brain

2788.4 --> 2794.8
chemistry for starters

2791.2 --> 2794.7999999999997
opioids change people

2796.319 --> 2805.0
seen it happen

2801.91 --> 2805.0
[Music]

2809.04 --> 2813.44
like my mother wasn't methadone like her

2812.4 --> 2817.119
final

2813.44 --> 2820.079
stages after cancer [ __ ] and all that

2817.119 --> 2822.56
and like that changed her a lot that

2820.079 --> 2825.6800000000003
changed her more than

2822.56 --> 2828.72
like the fear of death even she just

2825.68 --> 2831.359
visually like she went like completely

2828.72 --> 2833.839
demonically crazy at points like out of

2831.359 --> 2833.839
nowhere

2836.64 --> 2843.839
it's the craziest thing i've ever seen

2840.48 --> 2845.599
and i myself went kind of crazy here and

2843.839 --> 2848.4
there as well

2845.599 --> 2849.04
but not from not from drugs but just

2848.4 --> 2852.4
because

2849.04 --> 2852.88
i just i don't know was being creative

2852.4 --> 2855.76
and

2852.88 --> 2856.2400000000002
i was just experimenting with borders of

2855.76 --> 2859.8390000000004
how a

2856.24 --> 2859.839
person can be

2860.16 --> 2865.52
especially concerning yeah extreme

2863.119 --> 2866.319
extreme energies and extreme convictions

2865.52 --> 2868.0
and all that

2866.319 --> 2870.24
i don't know it's it's not a really good

2868.0 --> 2874.079
comparison but i've seen my mother like

2870.24 --> 2876.64
go really wild-eyed and

2874.079 --> 2877.6800000000003
like like almost like a goblin suddenly

2876.64 --> 2887.839
possessed her

2877.68 --> 2887.839
out of nowhere really freaky that stuff

2889.17 --> 2901.839
[Music]

2890.559 --> 2901.8390000000004
anyway it's a sad subject

2912.839 --> 2915.839
hey

2929.12 --> 2932.179
[Music]

2934.64 --> 2939.839
hmm that's

2938.319 --> 2942.0
that's funny that you would say that

2939.839 --> 2946.64
martin tolberg

2942.0 --> 2948.96
because it's so weird in the

2946.64 --> 2950.7999999999997
uh the mc the spiritual mechanics of my

2948.96 --> 2954.559
healer his tradition that's

2950.8 --> 2957.44
exactly what he says it's like if you

2954.559 --> 2959.599
use drugs even very light drugs

2957.44 --> 2962.2400000000002
just slightly mind altering it basically

2959.599 --> 2965.52
displaces your focus

2962.24 --> 2969.1189999999997
your spirit out of your body you go

2965.52 --> 2972.64
dreaming but it kind of swepts more

2969.119 --> 2973.6800000000003
into the dream displaces it effectively

2972.64 --> 2977.2
out of your body

2973.68 --> 2979.9199999999996
and then other ten entities take over

2977.2 --> 2980.24
through the autopilot mechanisms that

2979.92 --> 2983.44
well

2980.24 --> 2986.16
automatically take over

2983.44 --> 2987.2000000000003
and then other pulse influences can kind

2986.16 --> 2990.96
of take a grip

2987.2 --> 2995.2
over the autopilot it's freaky

2990.96 --> 2998.319
that's yeah so you're not far off

2995.2 --> 3001.04
so drugs make you

2998.319 --> 3001.68
more vulnerable to possession it doesn't

3001.04 --> 3004.72
actually

3001.68 --> 3006.3999999999996
automatically equate possession but it

3004.72 --> 3009.5989999999997
kind of leaves the control

3006.4 --> 3012.079
open for outside grabs for spiritual

3009.599 --> 3015.6800000000003
grabs as it were

3012.079 --> 3017.8390000000004
see that's also why a lot of

3015.68 --> 3019.1189999999997
certain people in certain moods on drugs

3017.839 --> 3022.64
get extremely

3019.119 --> 3025.52
random they almost like try to summon

3022.64 --> 3027.92
something random into them

3025.52 --> 3029.839
they want that they want this mysterious

3027.92 --> 3030.96
influence to basically let them do

3029.839 --> 3034.0789999999997
something

3030.96 --> 3037.76
weird i know i've been hanging around

3034.079 --> 3037.76
very weird people in the past

3038.16 --> 3041.839
very weird people

3042.02 --> 3048.67
[Music]

3056.16 --> 3061.7599999999998
q is the military

3059.28 --> 3061.76
okay

3064.16 --> 3067.7599999999998
that's okay mark collard these are very

3066.8 --> 3069.92
heavy things

3067.76 --> 3072.079
that yeah especially if you're gonna

3069.92 --> 3073.92
wait a long time with it

3072.079 --> 3076.0
it weighs on the heart and the longer

3073.92 --> 3077.52
you keep it to yourself the heavier it's

3076.0 --> 3081.68
gonna weigh

3077.52 --> 3084.319
so i'm glad

3081.68 --> 3086.319
that you were able to get over that

3084.319 --> 3087.839
threshold for yourself because you're

3086.319 --> 3091.359
the one that's burdened with it you got

3087.839 --> 3094.0789999999997
to realize that you're the one that's

3091.359 --> 3096.16
like the guy has the problem but his

3094.079 --> 3097.3590000000004
perspective on his problem and his

3096.16 --> 3098.72
feelings about it

3097.359 --> 3100.48
and the way he deals with that is going

3098.72 --> 3103.839
to be very different from

3100.48 --> 3105.119
your response to his problems you got to

3103.839 --> 3108.72
realize that

3105.119 --> 3113.04
that's why i gave my advice as i did

3108.72 --> 3116.3999999999996
heroin yeah yeah yeah yes very

3113.04 --> 3117.92
so it's yeah it's it's considered the

3116.4 --> 3120.88
toughest one

3117.92 --> 3120.88
so yeah

3121.119 --> 3128.079
although you can get off it i i've

3124.4 --> 3129.92
it's an interesting story from my past

3128.079 --> 3131.2000000000003
pretty much i haven't seen them in a

3129.92 --> 3134.48
long time

3131.2 --> 3137.5989999999997
but like the first coffee shop in

3134.48 --> 3139.2
the village i originally lived in was

3137.599 --> 3140.319
just one coffee shop that had the

3139.2 --> 3144.0789999999997
permission for that

3140.319 --> 3147.7599999999998
only one and that guy used to be like a

3144.079 --> 3147.76
pretty severe heroin addict

3148.96 --> 3156.0
and he completely quit completely

3153.2 --> 3157.68
but was tortured by it like people that

3156.0 --> 3160.48
knew him did

3157.68 --> 3162.319
know that sometimes he just like dude i

3160.48 --> 3163.839
feel so [ __ ] up because of this

3162.319 --> 3166.319
and then he just keeps it to himself and

3163.839 --> 3169.119
it's very he's a good boss like

3166.319 --> 3171.44
but he's like has this heroin addiction

3169.119 --> 3174.2400000000002
in the background just whining to him

3171.44 --> 3175.52
so badly often it's a terrible

3174.24 --> 3178.3999999999996
experience but hey

3175.52 --> 3179.119
he still got out of it i think he stayed

3178.4 --> 3182.48
out of it

3179.119 --> 3185.52
should be and he has like

3182.48 --> 3189.839
three four pretty gorgeous daughters

3185.52 --> 3193.04
so yeah you can make it even after that

3189.839 --> 3195.839
but but it's gonna be very punishing

3193.04 --> 3195.839
one way or the other

3198.079 --> 3202.7200000000003
but yeah maybe that's kind of like a

3201.119 --> 3204.88
a hope i've always thought it was kind

3202.72 --> 3207.52
of hopeful like okay even if you get in

3204.88 --> 3211.839
there you can still get out of it and

3207.52 --> 3211.839
make something it's not all not all is

3217.13 --> 3220.7090000000003
[Music]

3220.839 --> 3223.839

3224.24 --> 3239.85
all right

3236.74 --> 3239.85
[Music]

3262.0 --> 3267.04
hmm i'm glad to hear that

3277.119 --> 3284.559
right and

3280.4 --> 3286.64
yeah besides you can like

3284.559 --> 3288.7200000000003
it also depends on like how young it

3286.64 --> 3289.44
happened and how quickly you got out of

3288.72 --> 3292.319
it

3289.44 --> 3293.44
because if you've been like on it for

3292.319 --> 3296.16
half your life

3293.44 --> 3298.16
then it's like programmed the way you do

3296.16 --> 3299.7599999999998
things so badly it's very hard to get

3298.16 --> 3302.48
out but it's just well like a

3299.76 --> 3303.8390000000004
short period still very dangerous but if

3302.48 --> 3305.52
you get out of it and stay out of it

3303.839 --> 3308.72
very long then

3305.52 --> 3310.88
like the effect that echoes so much

3308.72 --> 3312.16
the actual addiction of the original

3310.88 --> 3315.52
memory

3312.16 --> 3318.0
it it's always gonna stay like that but

3315.52 --> 3318.88
you can still grow out of it enough to

3318.0 --> 3322.319
get

3318.88 --> 3322.96
similar peaks so it doesn't weigh as

3322.319 --> 3324.96
much

3322.96 --> 3326.64
anymore because you can just get the

3324.96 --> 3329.76
same kind of kicks out of life

3326.64 --> 3330.799
if you haven't burnt yourself out too

3329.76 --> 3335.8390000000004
much with it

3330.799 --> 3335.839
for too long

3355.68 --> 3363.839
all right guns have never run rmp

3359.28 --> 3363.8390000000004
yeah have a great weekend yourself

3369.76 --> 3373.6800000000003
and yeah thanks for the paypal donation

[Music]

3385.78 --> 3389.5890000000004
[Music]

3398.96 --> 3409.04
yeah nice

3405.68 --> 3410.3999999999996
yeah mark collard that's how the the guy

3409.04 --> 3413.599
that i talked about

3410.4 --> 3415.44
my example that's what he did too

3413.599 --> 3417.04
but you got to be made of some strong

3415.44 --> 3420.0
stuff and

3417.04 --> 3421.7599999999998
you also got you gotta have a life it's

3420.0 --> 3423.839
very you gotta have like a plan you

3421.76 --> 3427.6800000000003
gotta have an alternative

3423.839 --> 3430.88
something to build on something to work

3427.68 --> 3434.16
to distract you from the

3430.88 --> 3436.559
from the drug memories or yeah

3434.16 --> 3439.04
if you have nothing what are you going

3436.559 --> 3441.3590000000004
to do is going to drive you nuts see

3439.04 --> 3444.319
but if you got a something if you've got

3441.359 --> 3444.319
something to build

3445.04 --> 3448.72
something to work towards that works

3448.079 --> 3452.0
much

3448.72 --> 3452.0
that works out much better

3453.04 --> 3456.4
and hey for the guy that i mentioned it

3455.359 --> 3458.799
was

3456.4 --> 3460.079
had being a coffee shop owner doing

3458.799 --> 3461.839
business with that which was

3460.079 --> 3463.76
quite exciting by the way because at the

3461.839 --> 3465.04
time there were still a lot of criminal

3463.76 --> 3467.76
elements

3465.04 --> 3469.599
around because it was just kind of

3467.76 --> 3471.76
freshly

3469.599 --> 3473.119
condoned you know the condoning policy

3471.76 --> 3477.0400000000004
has only had only been

3473.119 --> 3479.119
freshly done

3477.04 --> 3480.48
so there was still a lot of risk to it

3479.119 --> 3482.48
and he had to deal with criminals it was

3480.48 --> 3486.839
very exciting life for him

3482.48 --> 3489.839
and that worked great like he liked the

3486.839 --> 3489.839
challenge

3493.88 --> 3498.799
[Music]

3496.64 --> 3501.1189999999997
as far as i know he's got quite a lot of

3498.799 --> 3502.48
money and he was into gold even back

3501.119 --> 3504.6400000000003
then

3502.48 --> 3504.64
so

3513.119 --> 3517.839
metadata metadon is terrible

3520.319 --> 3527.359
that's the [ __ ] that that starts

3523.44 --> 3530.4
if anything what methadone does is

3527.359 --> 3532.64
make you viable to demonic possession

3530.4 --> 3534.4
because that's the example that i gave

3532.64 --> 3540.16
what happened with my mother

3534.4 --> 3540.1600000000003
in the last stages it's because of the

3542.839 --> 3548.4
methadone

3545.44 --> 3549.119
now of course like in the rehab clinics

3548.4 --> 3551.28
and

3549.119 --> 3553.6800000000003
all that they give you extremely low

3551.28 --> 3557.2000000000003
dosages because it's only meant as a

3553.68 --> 3559.44
soothing effect to get you off but if

3557.2 --> 3561.52
you take it in high dosages like against

3559.44 --> 3562.88
pain relief yeah you will get those

3561.52 --> 3567.44
freaky effects

3562.88 --> 3569.359
eventually it's very creepy

3567.44 --> 3572.0
so you got to be very careful with it as

3569.359 --> 3573.65
well don't don't just say oh that's a

3572.0 --> 3576.48
great alternative no no

3573.65 --> 3587.839
[Music]

3576.48 --> 3587.839
still very dangerous

3598.839 --> 3601.839
um

3612.839 --> 3615.839
hmm

3640.839 --> 3643.839
hmm

3656.319 --> 3659.92
the cause of addiction

3664.799 --> 3671.839
how are you gonna do that

3678.72 --> 3684.5589999999997
when addictions basically are are just

3680.88 --> 3687.76
the natural mechanisms of the body

3684.559 --> 3690.96
to keep things going and an addiction

3687.76 --> 3694.7200000000003
typically happens when something is like

3690.96 --> 3696.88
like too much over exciting

3694.72 --> 3698.0
like addictions happen in nature too you

3696.88 --> 3699.96
know it's very weird

3698.0 --> 3703.15
how that works

3699.96 --> 3703.15
[Music]

3703.839 --> 3708.16
there's plenty addictions that go around

3705.76 --> 3710.3190000000004
it's always because

3708.16 --> 3712.0789999999997
well they have these sensories then they

3710.319 --> 3715.68
come across something that's just

3712.079 --> 3717.599
naturally around and it does something

3715.68 --> 3720.799
special to them and like over

3717.599 --> 3724.1600000000003
excites a certain type of kick

3720.799 --> 3724.96
feeling response in procreation cycle or

3724.16 --> 3727.5989999999997
any some

3724.96 --> 3728.96
some kind of cycle part of their

3727.599 --> 3731.2000000000003
experience

3728.96 --> 3740.4
and then it yeah makes them addicted to

3731.2 --> 3743.04
it it happens

3740.4 --> 3746.09
it's it's weird

3743.04 --> 3746.09
[Music]

3749.44 --> 3753.28
well the real cause of addiction of

3752.0 --> 3756.16
basically the

3753.28 --> 3756.1600000000003
the actions

3756.72 --> 3760.16
so the the taking of the drugs or

3759.28 --> 3764.7200000000003
whatever the

3760.16 --> 3764.72
the actual acts

3766.24 --> 3769.839
those are the cause

3770.96 --> 3773.76
that you do it

3775.28 --> 3779.599
because you always people always want a

3778.559 --> 3782.559
reward

3779.599 --> 3783.119
it's what they look forward to can be

3782.559 --> 3786.559
very

3783.119 --> 3789.44
inspiring but if you let that

3786.559 --> 3792.3190000000004
reward be bent to something as simple

3789.44 --> 3795.44
and overly rewarding as

3792.319 --> 3798.0
yeah heavy drugs then

3795.44 --> 3800.48
yeah it's not it's gonna take away from

3798.0 --> 3803.28
the natural rewarding cycle

3800.48 --> 3804.72
of just doing sensible and productive

3803.28 --> 3811.8390000000004
things

3804.72 --> 3811.839
that's a problem

3816.16 --> 3820.799
that addiction is just natural it's just

3818.64 --> 3823.52
that

3820.799 --> 3824.48
if you're going to decide to bypass

3823.52 --> 3828.319
natural

3824.48 --> 3831.68
reward systems

3828.319 --> 3833.92
and then get it more quickly

3831.68 --> 3839.839
through some kind of drug then you're

3833.92 --> 3839.839
basically bypassing on life itself

3841.2 --> 3844.64
yeah bypassing logos

3846.079 --> 3854.319
that facebook like button addiction

3850.48 --> 3856.72
it's hilarious but yeah

3854.319 --> 3858.48
it sounds very funny you know but it can

3856.72 --> 3860.9599999999996
get pretty severe

3858.48 --> 3862.64
it falls like under the neurotic

3860.96 --> 3867.599
addictions

3862.64 --> 3870.799
really now where before

3867.599 --> 3874.0
i could be as bold as to stay okay this

3870.799 --> 3875.7599999999998
is this is wet finger work so i i didn't

3874.0 --> 3877.28
do any research on this okay this is

3875.76 --> 3880.1600000000003
just my intuition again

3877.28 --> 3881.599
but i think it's pretty safe to bet that

3880.16 --> 3885.839
say

3881.599 --> 3889.28
30 years ago neurotic

3885.839 --> 3892.5589999999997
actions would typically be expressed in

3889.28 --> 3895.6800000000003
locking your door like 10 times or

3892.559 --> 3898.7200000000003
you know that kind of thing checking

3895.68 --> 3901.68
something like 10 times well now

3898.72 --> 3903.52
i'll bet you from all the people around

3901.68 --> 3904.96
the world that have those types of

3903.52 --> 3908.799
disorders

3904.96 --> 3910.96
it's going to be checking the likes

3908.799 --> 3912.559
checking this checking that checking

3910.96 --> 3914.2400000000002
that checking this checking that

3912.559 --> 3917.039
checking that

3914.24 --> 3918.3999999999996
it's going to be that i'll bet you

3917.039 --> 3919.28
that's where it's going to be bent to

3918.4 --> 3921.2000000000003
now that

3919.28 --> 3922.3190000000004
those same types of neurosis is instead

3921.2 --> 3924.48
of just

3922.319 --> 3925.52
being arbitrary things like doorknobs

3924.48 --> 3929.76
and all that

3925.52 --> 3929.7599999999998
it's going to be social media actions

3930.24 --> 3934.24
and it's weird because i myself had have

3932.96 --> 3937.44
been

3934.24 --> 3939.2799999999997
not a lot but i've had those moments too

3937.44 --> 3941.039
where i was kind of like

3939.28 --> 3942.3190000000004
neurotic and then you just keep checking

3941.039 --> 3943.3590000000004
checking checking is there nothing is

3942.319 --> 3944.48
there nothing is there nothing new

3943.359 --> 3947.44
nothing new

3944.48 --> 3949.119
yeah and it is kind of neurotic when you

3947.44 --> 3951.52
do that

3949.119 --> 3952.88
it's burning dissatisfaction and you

3951.52 --> 3955.119
just want more more more

3952.88 --> 3955.119
more

3960.24 --> 3964.8799999999997
i need people can do that before they

3963.92 --> 3968.559
like oh

3964.88 --> 3970.799
i got to go but i have to check this

3968.559 --> 3972.48
10 times then they can't get out of the

3970.799 --> 3976.64
checking cycle because they're too

3972.48 --> 3978.2400000000002
excited for that's also neurotic so

3976.64 --> 3980.64
yeah i think i'm on to something with

3978.24 --> 3983.0389999999998
this for neurosis would be like

3980.64 --> 3986.4
doorknobs and [ __ ]

3983.039 --> 3989.76
or i don't know silly things clicking

3986.4 --> 3992.319
it can get pretty weird with neurosis

3989.76 --> 3993.76
but it's going to be the social media

3992.319 --> 3996.88
checking now

3993.76 --> 3998.079
much much more on average i think you

3996.88 --> 4001.039
will see that

3998.079 --> 4002.2400000000002
like the newer generations they won't

4001.039 --> 4006.48
have

4002.24 --> 4008.8799999999997
the old sets of neuroses as much

4006.48 --> 4021.839
compared to the newer genera yeah to the

4008.88 --> 4021.839
older generation

4032.839 --> 4036.72
so

4035.44 --> 4048.079
[Music]

4036.72 --> 4049.839
okay yeah you can go away now

4048.079 --> 4051.44
yeah i'm having a serious conversation

4049.839 --> 4054.4
here and this is not the

4051.44 --> 4056.4
the time for trolling you might have

4054.4 --> 4059.6800000000003
noticed we're having a very

4056.4 --> 4062.4
serious conversation about very serious

4059.68 --> 4063.839
sensitive subjects this is not the place

4062.4 --> 4067.52
for you

4063.839 --> 4077.839
to start squirting over your [ __ ]

4067.52 --> 4077.839
trolling okay get out

4090.16 --> 4094.48
yep and you guys did give him plenty of

4092.24 --> 4099.44
warning

4094.48 --> 4099.44
ample warning that's how you say it

4102.839 --> 4107.839
right

4105.52 --> 4109.92
there's such an unbelievable level of

4107.839 --> 4113.199
dynamic in the english language that

4109.92 --> 4113.1990000000005
sometimes it's just like

4113.679 --> 4117.679
ways to say things just pop out of

4116.719 --> 4121.44
nowhere

4117.679 --> 4124.56
i'm like where's this coming from

4121.44 --> 4126.5599999999995
but i but it does mean what it i think

4124.56 --> 4128.0
it means but i don't even know what it

4126.56 --> 4130.080000000001
means i just knows

4128.0 --> 4132.719
i just know it means the thing that i

4130.08 --> 4135.6
want it to mean

4132.719 --> 4135.6
how does this work

4137.52 --> 4140.56
anyway yeah english language is so

4140.0 --> 4143.52
dynamic

4140.56 --> 4144.64
so many ways of saying things and so

4143.52 --> 4161.839000000001
many ways

4144.64 --> 4161.839
that things have been said

4164.109 --> 4167.1990000000005
[Music]

4171.27 --> 4175.839000000001
[Music]

4172.839 --> 4175.839
um

4176.319 --> 4189.839000000001
i'm gonna google it anyway

4198.08 --> 4202.88
enough or more than enough plentiful

4200.56 --> 4205.120000000001
okay interesting

4202.88 --> 4207.1990000000005
i don't know if i actually why wouldn't

4205.12 --> 4210.0
i say

4207.199 --> 4210.799999999999
yeah i get ample warning there's enough

4210.0 --> 4216.0
what yeah

4210.8 --> 4217.92
whoa dude

4216.0 --> 4219.36
if i said that's like literally the

4217.92 --> 4223.52
first time ever

4219.36 --> 4223.5199999999995
that i looked up that word ever

4224.239 --> 4231.759999999999
right yet i knew it i heard it somewhere

4228.08 --> 4234.96
and i knew it

4231.76 --> 4238.56
how can i know this i've never ever

4234.96 --> 4238.56
looked up that word before

4239.6 --> 4245.84
how do i understand what it means

4253.36 --> 4261.36
could it also be that that's just

4258.32 --> 4264.88
that there should be that if you just

4261.36 --> 4267.36
see somebody saying things like ample

4264.88 --> 4267.36
warning

4267.44 --> 4272.08
that it's something that is said in a

4270.64 --> 4275.4400000000005
specific context so

4272.08 --> 4278.159
if you then constantly approach

4275.44 --> 4281.839999999999
that saying from a certain context the

4278.159 --> 4284.799999999999
esoteric nature of what is said

4281.84 --> 4287.04
then by the context you automatically

4284.8 --> 4288.320000000001
get the understanding of what it means

4287.04 --> 4290.8
even though you don't

4288.32 --> 4293.28
literally know what the word means but

4290.8 --> 4294.56
just by association you start to

4293.28 --> 4301.84
understand

4294.56 --> 4301.84
is that why i understand this word

4302.159 --> 4308.4
so by the the frequency of its

4305.44 --> 4309.36
use that i've been over spo overexposed

4308.4 --> 4312.96
to

4309.36 --> 4315.36
the ex overexposed exposed to that just

4312.96 --> 4316.56
made me understand it even though i've

4315.36 --> 4320.0
never actually

4316.56 --> 4320.0
cognitively looked it up

4324.56 --> 4328.56
right mark-colored yeah you're totally

4326.159 --> 4329.599999999999
on to it yeah i didn't even read what

4328.56 --> 4331.280000000001
you were saying but you're saying the

4329.6 --> 4343.679
same things

4331.28 --> 4346.239
it's fascinating how this works

4343.679 --> 4357.84
inferred from the sentences surrounding

4346.239 --> 4357.839999999999
it right

4363.199 --> 4370.4
i know it's just in a way it's just very

4366.8 --> 4372.320000000001
magical to me language itself is kind of

4370.4 --> 4376.639999999999
magical there's something spiritual

4372.32 --> 4380.48
intuitive to it that goes beyond

4376.64 --> 4384.0
the consciousness and it's fascinating

4380.48 --> 4386.4
when you find out like

4384.0 --> 4388.4
in a short little moment like what i

4386.4 --> 4390.799999999999
yeah how i put it down

4388.4 --> 4394.08
like i never looked up the word yet i

4390.8 --> 4397.28
know how to use it

4394.08 --> 4400.159
that's that's magical to me but yeah it

4397.28 --> 4404.639999999999
can be figured out how that works

4400.159 --> 4406.639999999999
but on a surface conscious level

4404.64 --> 4407.84
it's not something that everybody always

4406.64 --> 4409.679
thinks about

4407.84 --> 4411.04
like a linguist would probably

4409.679 --> 4413.1990000000005
understand

4411.04 --> 4414.159
you know somebody really knows

4413.199 --> 4416.32
everything about

4414.159 --> 4417.839999999999
language and about communication that's

4416.32 --> 4419.44
really started up on that they would

4417.84 --> 4422.719
understand but

4419.44 --> 4423.599999999999
general people they don't really

4422.719 --> 4426.719
consciously

4423.6 --> 4432.8
know that it works like that

4426.719 --> 4432.8
they just do it don't think about it too

4438.84 --> 4441.84
much

4443.92 --> 4447.92
right martin tolberg that's that's also

4445.92 --> 4450.96
a good example for motoric

4447.92 --> 4453.36
memory skills how your intuition

4450.96 --> 4455.679
uses the preponderance of your motoric

4453.36 --> 4458.799999999999
abilities

4455.679 --> 4462.32
to then basically automatically

4458.8 --> 4465.84
do the right things in the right moments

4462.32 --> 4469.599999999999
testing out what those right things are

4465.84 --> 4471.360000000001
and then improving it

4469.6 --> 4472.719
and yeah a lot of it is kind of

4471.36 --> 4476.159
intuitive it's like

4472.719 --> 4479.92
where's your consciousness will focus

4476.159 --> 4482.4
on something on like an imagination of

4479.92 --> 4487.679
where you're gonna go

4482.4 --> 4490.879999999999
you feel it out and then your body

4487.679 --> 4493.679
or your subconscious kind of programs

4490.88 --> 4497.84
your body to basically expect that and

4493.679 --> 4497.84
to work towards that

4498.0 --> 4502.64
and that part is very fluid often

4501.12 --> 4505.12
doesn't require a lot of conscious

4502.64 --> 4505.12
attention

4505.6 --> 4511.84
that's interesting isn't it

4536.84 --> 4539.84
hmm

4550.84 --> 4553.84
ugh

4555.52 --> 4559.679
yeah more colored wow hot and cold i

4558.56 --> 4562.159000000001
don't know

4559.679 --> 4564.159
but it's been very mixed like one day

4562.159 --> 4566.5599999999995
it's all raining cloudy and the next day

4564.159 --> 4568.719
it's kind of sunny and it's windy

4566.56 --> 4571.6
and the next day it's not windy and it's

4568.719 --> 4571.6
like all mixing

4572.64 --> 4576.08
it's not very stable weather

4576.4 --> 4584.48
like this weather is almost like it

4579.92 --> 4584.4800000000005
used to be during april

4592.64 --> 4596.400000000001
so october is the new april

4606.84 --> 4609.84
hmm

4618.4 --> 4624.799999999999
right yeah mark more colored i know

4622.239 --> 4626.239
it was really warm not yeah not too long

4624.8 --> 4628.8
ago here too

4626.239 --> 4629.5199999999995
and then it shifted again and it was

4628.8 --> 4631.4400000000005
like

4629.52 --> 4632.56
one or two days when it was really

4631.44 --> 4635.44
unusually warm

4632.56 --> 4637.84
compared to the the rest of the the

4635.44 --> 4637.839999999999
month

4640.0 --> 4644.56
and then when that stopped it got really

4642.88 --> 4651.84
stormy shitty cold

4644.56 --> 4651.84
windy weather after that like really bad

4663.6 --> 4669.84
oh dear agm that's terrible it's not

4666.32 --> 4669.84
been constantly raining here but

4676.84 --> 4679.84
enough

4683.44 --> 4687.678999999999
did we though more color did we really

4690.56 --> 4693.84
maybe i don't know

4695.679 --> 4698.8
you know i'm always wondering nowadays

4698.48 --> 4701.919999999999
like

4698.8 --> 4705.04
okay so there is something stated

4701.92 --> 4708.4800000000005
about something in the past right

4705.04 --> 4711.92
so how

4708.48 --> 4721.839999999999
did they or like who is stating this

4711.92 --> 4721.84
how did they figure this out

4754.159 --> 4757.199
oh thank you thank you yeah i was on

4756.719 --> 4759.679
mute

4757.199 --> 4759.678999999999
you're right

4760.96 --> 4765.76
but as i was saying there are

4763.04 --> 4768.8
indications that there have been some

4765.76 --> 4771.280000000001
ice cap of some sort

4768.8 --> 4771.28
moving

4772.56 --> 4779.92
like in the north of europe and all that

4777.04 --> 4782.32
it's just it seems very logical that

4779.92 --> 4785.4400000000005
there was

4782.32 --> 4788.5599999999995
but when exactly that was

4785.44 --> 4789.599999999999
i don't know and there was also a mini

4788.56 --> 4794.719
ice age

4789.6 --> 4797.76
remember was it in the 17th century

4794.719 --> 4801.36
there's paintings and everything

4797.76 --> 4804.8
so if there was a mini ice age

4801.36 --> 4808.08
then how do we know

4804.8 --> 4811.1990000000005
that there was this specific

4808.08 --> 4812.719
ice age way way way before that did all

4811.199 --> 4816.32
this

4812.719 --> 4819.84
this can just be a mini ice age

4816.32 --> 4819.84
what did that do

4822.96 --> 4829.36
anyways maybe over

4826.239 --> 4829.839999999999
generalizing a little but these days i'm

4829.36 --> 4831.92
just

4829.84 --> 4833.92
very suspicious about any kind of

4831.92 --> 4837.36
statement about history of earth

4833.92 --> 4838.32
and humanity that i used to take for

4837.36 --> 4840.0
granted every

4838.32 --> 4847.84
every time something is a certain i'm

4840.0 --> 4847.84
like oh really so is that actually true

4849.28 --> 4852.639
where the stradivarius violin was born

4851.679 --> 4855.92
from

4852.639 --> 4859.12
is it i didn't know that

4855.92 --> 4861.04
right anyway i'm gonna round out the

4859.12 --> 4864.08
show guys

4861.04 --> 4865.6
so thanks everyone for coming i hope you

4864.08 --> 4868.639
liked this show

4865.6 --> 4872.0
uh i thought it was a it was pretty good

4868.639 --> 4873.76
pretty intense also with the

4872.0 --> 4875.76
drug addiction talk and the issues with

4873.76 --> 4877.84
that pretty heavy

4875.76 --> 4880.2390000000005
but overall i thought it was a pretty

4877.84 --> 4882.4800000000005
productive show

4880.239 --> 4883.28
so yeah if you liked it then please

4908.96 --> 4913.36
financially by now

4910.239 --> 4915.28
compared to like three weeks ago for

4913.36 --> 4919.5199999999995
example
