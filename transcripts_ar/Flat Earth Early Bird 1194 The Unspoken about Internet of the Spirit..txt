of the month has been much lower than in

102.32 --> 106.079
the last few

104.399 --> 107.2

like brandon my first patreon subscriber

130.0 --> 133.92
uh

131.36 --> 135.76000000000002
right the weather

133.92 --> 137.599
today it's

135.76 --> 140.319
like this is

137.599 --> 143.83999999999997
basically just summer now

140.319 --> 143.83999999999997
this is just summer weather

144.48 --> 149.04
it's

146.16 --> 154.16
almost completely wind still

149.04 --> 154.16
the air outside is just really warm

154.84 --> 161.84
and yeah it's a bit moist too and god

158.239 --> 164.31900000000002
there's like bugs all over the place

161.84 --> 166.64000000000001
like just before i started the show i

164.319 --> 168.23899999999998
was sitting on my balcony just smoking a

166.64 --> 170.95899999999997
bit

168.239 --> 172.239
and i noticed like a little spider

170.959 --> 174.16
like sitting

172.239 --> 177.36
right there on the railing

174.16 --> 180.239
on its legs and then just boom

177.36 --> 182.239
it just flew off in the heat

180.239 --> 184.72
didn't like weave any kind of thread or

182.239 --> 188.56
anything it just

184.72 --> 190.72
yeah got carried away by the the hot air

188.56 --> 193.76
it was fun it was funny to see but

190.72 --> 196.0
there's like bugs all sorts all over the

193.76 --> 196.0
place

197.44 --> 202.64
very little ones and pretty big ones

201.04 --> 204.56
so yeah

202.64 --> 207.11999999999998
bugs are having a field day out there

204.56 --> 207.12
literally

208.319 --> 213.83999999999997
and i think that most mammals are just

210.56 --> 213.84
kind of like sitting

214.0 --> 219.44
back and forth in the shadow in the sun

216.56 --> 219.44
and just chilling

220.08 --> 223.68
because it is if it does feel like a

222.159 --> 226.319
summer's day

223.68 --> 229.59900000000002
although it's not super hot yet but it's

226.319 --> 232.56
still it's already kind of warm

229.599 --> 236.319
so yeah beautiful day

232.56 --> 238.4
still a couple of clouds up there but

236.319 --> 240.48
no trails though

238.4 --> 243.87900000000002
these definitely seem like naturally

240.48 --> 243.879
formed clouds

251.04 --> 254.16899999999998
[Music]

256.32 --> 261.28
hello crockett first in chat bill nye

258.639 --> 265.04
the science denier m

261.28 --> 265.03999999999996
territ306 good to see you

265.36 --> 271.56
it is thursday the 24th of march 2022

271.68 --> 275.6
yeah

273.12 --> 278.24
it started a bit late but yeah i'll keep

275.6 --> 281.199
going because nathan

278.24 --> 283.84000000000003
unfortunately is not doing a live fed

281.199 --> 283.84000000000003
today

284.0 --> 288.0
it might have something to do with that

285.759 --> 289.199
he discovered he has broken ribs

288.0 --> 291.759
apparently

289.199 --> 294.8
still from the carpet incident

291.759 --> 298.40000000000003
i don't know he hasn't set so far but

294.8 --> 301.28000000000003
yeah no fed alive today

298.4 --> 301.28
unfortunately

301.44 --> 305.199
a bit of a bummer

303.199 --> 308.40000000000003
but yeah that means that i can keep on

305.199 --> 310.0
going longer so

308.4 --> 312.96
that's why i kind of took it easy

310.0 --> 312.96
starting up today

315.52 --> 319.28
right so how are you guys doing

321.28 --> 326.4
is the weather

322.56 --> 326.4
as good over there as it is here

326.72 --> 330.56
a parrot you were saying yesterday that

328.72 --> 333.91900000000004
was like

330.56 --> 333.919
hot and moist

334.56 --> 338.28000000000003
is it still like that

338.4 --> 343.19899999999996
oh it's 19 degrees celsius over here man

341.36 --> 346.32
yeah that is

343.199 --> 346.32
that is fairly warm

350.8 --> 354.479
according to the weather forecast it is

352.88 --> 357.52
kind of the peak and it should be

354.479 --> 360.31899999999996
cooling off a little

357.52 --> 362.56
after the weekend

360.319 --> 364.88
all right

362.56 --> 367.6
go on for three hours

364.88 --> 369.12
yeah we'll see about that

367.6 --> 370.88
we'll see about that there it i don't

369.12 --> 373.84000000000003
know if i'm gonna go for three hours i

370.88 --> 373.84
don't know if i have to

374.96 --> 378.79999999999995
the input

376.479 --> 382.24
inside stored

378.8 --> 382.24
to basically roll it out

383.759 --> 386.72
man but there are a lot of things that i

385.36 --> 389.52000000000004
was

386.72 --> 392.16
thinking about but

389.52 --> 394.24
they've temporarily blanked out a bit

392.16 --> 397.759
was it again

394.24 --> 399.68
yeah anyway i was watching owen benjamin

397.759 --> 404.28000000000003
at this

399.68 --> 404.28000000000003
little outside stream again

418.72 --> 421.28000000000003
yeah

420.08 --> 425.599
great stuff

421.28 --> 428.31899999999996
like that helped because before

425.599 --> 429.759
i was kind of grumpy

428.319 --> 433.52000000000004
again

429.759 --> 434.84000000000003
dissatisfied with my past self etc etc

433.52 --> 436.56
that typical

434.84 --> 438.71999999999997
spiral

436.56 --> 440.0
but then i watched on benjamin life and

438.72 --> 443.91900000000004
it was like

440.0 --> 443.919
he was just it's the ecstatic

444.4 --> 448.4
talking about his wife's cooking and all

446.24 --> 448.40000000000003
that

449.039 --> 453.759
and that and that really did calm me

451.36 --> 455.52000000000004
down a lot

453.759 --> 458.24
so i'm kind of glad i watched that right

455.52 --> 458.24
before the show

461.599 --> 466.87899999999996
hey goalie

462.84 --> 466.87899999999996
mckernan good to see you

467.599 --> 470.96
right

468.96 --> 473.35999999999996
so i wasn't the only one yesterday

470.96 --> 477.479
having issues with youtube

473.36 --> 477.47900000000004
nathan was having them too

478.16 --> 483.36
right it does seem today though that it

480.56 --> 484.72
is restored so it probably again was an

483.36 --> 486.96000000000004
update

484.72 --> 486.96000000000004
right

487.12 --> 491.8
let's just update technical issues

519.919 --> 525.279
i was thinking about like the bible for

522.479 --> 527.9200000000001
a bit genesis based on something owen

525.279 --> 529.76
was saying also about him basically

527.92 --> 531.68
start talking about how he believed in

529.76 --> 533.12
giants and it was epic and i'm totally

531.68 --> 535.12
with him like

533.12 --> 537.36
we're pretty much on the same frequency

535.12 --> 537.36
there

538.32 --> 542.6400000000001
then i was thinking like genesis like

540.8 --> 545.1999999999999
supposedly god

542.64 --> 546.8389999999999
took a rip from adam

545.2 --> 550.8000000000001
and then

546.839 --> 550.8000000000001
fashioned eve out of it

550.88 --> 555.059
so

551.74 --> 555.059
[Music]

555.76 --> 560.48
did she grow

557.68 --> 562.88
out of that or was she literally

560.48 --> 566.64
fashioned out of that rib because that

562.88 --> 569.04
would imply that eve was probably

566.64 --> 570.56
i don't know

569.04 --> 573.92
at 20th

570.56 --> 573.92
of the size of adam

574.72 --> 579.6
are there any specificities about their

577.36 --> 582.48
height again i asked this question

579.6 --> 584.16
before about the bible

582.48 --> 587.9200000000001
i have not

584.16 --> 589.76
heard any specificities about

587.92 --> 592.16
even adam's height

589.76 --> 594.72
they might exist though

592.16 --> 596.24
like in the book of giants non-canon

594.72 --> 597.6800000000001
right

596.24 --> 601.76
but

597.68 --> 604.56
just from the direct logical inference

601.76 --> 605.68
seems to me like eve was probably

604.56 --> 608.2399999999999
like

605.68 --> 609.1999999999999
very tiny compared to

608.24 --> 611.36
adam

609.2 --> 614.9590000000001
right and that

611.36 --> 617.2
also then very interestingly

614.959 --> 621.5999999999999
directly clicks

617.2 --> 624.1600000000001
with my conception that the giants even

621.6 --> 628.48
grew super tall

624.16 --> 628.48
but that they start out pretty small

628.56 --> 630.88
right

631.68 --> 635.5999999999999
and not saying that eve would have been

634.48 --> 638.0
a giant

635.6 --> 641.0400000000001
starting out small could have been it

638.0 --> 642.56
doesn't say it doesn't say oh eve grew

641.04 --> 644.48
and grew

642.56 --> 649.1999999999999
i don't remember any hearing anything

644.48 --> 649.2
like that ever biblical related right

650.16 --> 656.3199999999999
but maybe they could still

652.64 --> 659.279
procreate despite the size difference

656.32 --> 661.279
although yeah if we then think about

659.279 --> 663.6
like

661.279 --> 665.36
human procreation it becomes a little

663.6 --> 667.12
complicated

665.36 --> 670.72
but maybe

667.12 --> 673.6
the skills were different too like

670.72 --> 677.76
sounds kind of silly right

673.6 --> 680.24
but like maybe adam wasn't like

677.76 --> 682.56
super super hung

680.24 --> 685.12
in the sense that genitals might not

682.56 --> 688.4799999999999
have been to scale with his overall size

685.12 --> 692.079
i know that sounds really funny

688.48 --> 694.72
when i when you visualize that but

692.079 --> 696.959
who knows man seriously they're always

694.72 --> 699.9200000000001
displayed in in paintings and all that

696.959 --> 700.88
like just human sized and equal sized

699.92 --> 703.1999999999999
right

700.88 --> 705.279
but

703.2 --> 707.6
i don't think there's even a description

705.279 --> 709.4399999999999
anywhere of like oh god took the rip

707.6 --> 712.0
from adam and then

709.44 --> 714.9590000000001
he grew

712.0 --> 714.959
eve out of that

715.04 --> 720.16
right it's not not about growing about

717.839 --> 722.8000000000001
increasing size i remember it as

720.16 --> 724.88
fashioned it out of the rib

722.8 --> 726.56
so literally the rib

724.88 --> 729.519
and then it's like

726.56 --> 734.16
chiseling like carving a statue out of a

729.519 --> 734.16
rib right that's what that reminds me of

734.399 --> 739.76
but then that would imply that eve was

736.56 --> 739.76
actually really small

740.56 --> 746.7199999999999
i would like to hear you guys you guys

744.56 --> 748.0
about what you think about it what have

746.72 --> 751.76
you heard

748.0 --> 755.24
i mean some of you are pretty biblical

751.76 --> 755.24
what do you think

758.48 --> 763.6
hey goldie mckerman what

760.8 --> 765.92
nine hours jesus

763.6 --> 765.9200000000001
god

766.399 --> 769.76
it's a bit too long for me

770.72 --> 774.639
guarantee you're not gonna do a

772.16 --> 775.92
nine-hour stream ever

774.639 --> 778.0790000000001
that would be a

775.92 --> 781.3199999999999
completely pointless

778.079 --> 781.3199999999999
to me

788.72 --> 791.44
what is the carpet incident yeah wolf

790.72 --> 793.6800000000001
but

791.44 --> 795.6
remember when

793.68 --> 797.68
nathan got like

795.6 --> 800.639
a serious face wound and all that he had

797.68 --> 803.04
the beard for a bit well thankfully that

800.639 --> 803.92
has pretty much healed up pretty well

803.04 --> 806.24
but

803.92 --> 808.399
apparently he hadn't even really

806.24 --> 810.9590000000001
realized it

808.399 --> 814.16
during all that time

810.959 --> 817.8389999999999
he didn't just have like a face wound

814.16 --> 819.76
during that incident he also broke rips

817.839 --> 821.9200000000001
it just

819.76 --> 824.399
he didn't really

821.92 --> 826.639
immediately

824.399 --> 830.0
like go to the doctors with that he was

826.639 --> 832.5600000000001
just like ah my face my beautiful face

830.0 --> 833.519
the juggernaut [ __ ]

832.56 --> 836.959
um

833.519 --> 839.6
right and just the ribs was like kind of

836.959 --> 841.279
it kept annoying him so he went to the

839.6 --> 844.0790000000001
doctor about it they were like uh you

841.279 --> 845.6
got broken ribs

844.079 --> 847.68
he's been walking around with that for

845.6 --> 852.519
like weeks

847.68 --> 852.519
so yeah that's the carpet incident

868.72 --> 871.72
right

871.92 --> 874.24
so

879.76 --> 885.6
any feedback about

882.8 --> 887.76
eve

885.6 --> 891.44
probably not being

887.76 --> 894.639
the same size of adam like any kind of

891.44 --> 898.1600000000001
height differential or any

894.639 --> 899.6
numerical height notification about adam

898.16 --> 903.519
and eve

899.6 --> 906.72
in any biblical related reference

903.519 --> 908.16
that's original not just modernly made

906.72 --> 910.399
up

908.16 --> 910.399
right

910.56 --> 913.8389999999999
what do you guys know

919.839 --> 923.1600000000001
and gals

928.0 --> 931.279
are you thinking star wars

937.079 --> 941.399
riboflavin what

946.88 --> 952.0
what is that

949.36 --> 954.24
is that like a reference to the name of

952.0 --> 954.24
the

954.279 --> 958.88
microcellular organ basically

958.959 --> 965.279
because that is probably fictional

962.48 --> 965.279
i just saying

965.36 --> 969.759
i've

966.959 --> 973.04
been well not really digging

969.759 --> 975.12
i've been feeling out really broad as

973.04 --> 977.24
you know like going germany medicine

975.12 --> 979.839
going every

977.24 --> 982.5600000000001
conceivable logically consistent

979.839 --> 985.36
direction and of thinking concerning

982.56 --> 988.3199999999999
medical issues like pretty much all

985.36 --> 991.519
directions all of it

988.32 --> 992.9590000000001
it was just very confusing by the way

991.519 --> 995.36
because there are things that just

992.959 --> 998.7199999999999
simultaneously work that completely

995.36 --> 1000.9590000000001
contradict each other yet it all works

998.72 --> 1002.8000000000001
that's confusing as [ __ ]

1000.959 --> 1003.68
right

1002.8 --> 1006.079
but

1003.68 --> 1008.399
one thing that i have learned really is

1006.079 --> 1008.399
that

1008.72 --> 1015.1990000000001
it's not really just the virus

1012.8 --> 1017.92
idea concept right that we're all

1015.199 --> 1021.279
dealing with right now through policies

1017.92 --> 1025.4389999999999
for enforcing it upon us

1021.279 --> 1027.839
that thing is not just like a construct

1025.439 --> 1029.52
a cons a concept that's not actually

1027.839 --> 1031.4389999999999
been backed

1029.52 --> 1032.48
it seems

1031.439 --> 1034.0
like

1032.48 --> 1035.199
most

1034.0 --> 1036.12
things

1035.199 --> 1038.64
about

1036.12 --> 1042.1599999999999
microcellular biology have been

1038.64 --> 1042.16
established that way

1043.36 --> 1048.4799999999998
so that pretty much include the entire

1046.48 --> 1051.1200000000001
idea

1048.48 --> 1054.16
of how cells even replicate the

1051.12 --> 1057.28
ribosomes and all that

1054.16 --> 1061.28
it's purely conceptual it's pretty much

1057.28 --> 1063.44
purely as conceptual as the idea of what

1061.28 --> 1065.6789999999999
an atom

1063.44 --> 1069.6000000000001
physically is

1065.679 --> 1069.6000000000001
below the atomic scale

1076.96 --> 1082.08
it's

1079.2 --> 1084.16
it's rife microbiology microcellular

1082.08 --> 1087.4399999999998
biology is rife

1084.16 --> 1090.16
with assumption-based models

1087.44 --> 1092.64
that they kind of click match through

1090.16 --> 1096.559
the data

1092.64 --> 1097.679
of just how things do work on a bigger

1096.559 --> 1098.8799999999999
scale

1097.679 --> 1101.039
like oh

1098.88 --> 1103.8400000000001
this substance

1101.039 --> 1107.52
in this situation oh this is the result

1103.84 --> 1110.32
on average statistical and so that works

1107.52 --> 1113.44
so we're gonna from that process that

1110.32 --> 1116.24
actual empirical data collection

1113.44 --> 1118.799
derive infer

1116.24 --> 1122.08
that there is a very specific thing

1118.799 --> 1123.12
there on a microbiological scale doing

1122.08 --> 1126.0
that

1123.12 --> 1128.8799999999999
because it's happening right i think

1126.0 --> 1129.84
that most microbiology has pretty much

1128.88 --> 1132.64
been

1129.84 --> 1132.6399999999999
inferred

1133.2 --> 1138.96
in that way which is

1136.48 --> 1141.1200000000001
decently sensible enough

1138.96 --> 1143.6000000000001
problem is though

1141.12 --> 1145.1999999999998
the actual finalization the actual

1143.6 --> 1147.4399999999998
empirical

1145.2 --> 1148.6000000000001
confirmation

1147.44 --> 1153.1200000000001
of those

1148.6 --> 1156.24
microbiology microbiological functions

1153.12 --> 1159.9189999999999
are still kind of like

1156.24 --> 1162.559
apparently very hard

1159.919 --> 1164.88
to really get into that or

1162.559 --> 1167.039
or here's an alternative

1164.88 --> 1169.8400000000001
it has been dug into

1167.039 --> 1172.08
the results were extremely inconvenient

1169.84 --> 1174.08
and they grappled it and so we're not

1172.08 --> 1176.559
actually supposed to learn about that

1174.08 --> 1180.48
because it would completely undo another

1176.559 --> 1183.039
layer of very elaborate mind

1180.48 --> 1183.039
control

1183.12 --> 1186.0
it could be either

1189.76 --> 1194.16
they have photos of molecules no they

1191.76 --> 1197.6
don't really can a bear no they don't

1194.16 --> 1199.919
you can't have photos of molecules yeah

1197.6 --> 1199.9189999999999
light

1200.24 --> 1203.679
yeah it doesn't work like that

1202.24 --> 1206.4
it can't

1203.679 --> 1209.2800000000002
right the when you see

1206.4 --> 1212.0
supposed photos or molecules it's either

1209.28 --> 1214.0
just a 3d imagining

1212.0 --> 1215.76
really it's just an image just like what

1214.0 --> 1220.32
nasa does or

1215.76 --> 1223.28
it's electron microscope derived data

1220.32 --> 1227.2
right which is

1223.28 --> 1229.76
pretty much the best form of conceptual

1227.2 --> 1232.32
modeling

1229.76 --> 1233.2
that we've come up with as humanity thus

1232.32 --> 1236.799
far

1233.2 --> 1238.559
on the micro scale but it is

1236.799 --> 1241.36
derived

1238.559 --> 1243.039
it's not inferred it's derived so what

1241.36 --> 1247.28
basically is happening is like the

1243.039 --> 1250.1589999999999
oscillation patterns of electron flow

1247.28 --> 1254.0
is mapped out perfectly

1250.159 --> 1255.2800000000002
and then made into like a 3d represented

1254.0 --> 1258.0
rendering

1255.28 --> 1260.3999999999999
where you can sort of see the pathways

1258.0 --> 1262.72
and from that

1260.4 --> 1264.96
you get a model you get an you yeah you

1262.72 --> 1267.1200000000001
get a chart

1264.96 --> 1270.32
right and that's what you get to see

1267.12 --> 1273.6789999999999
that's electron microscope readout

1270.32 --> 1277.2
but it is not literally that it's

1273.679 --> 1279.039
it's almost like you get to see

1277.2 --> 1284.0
what is there

1279.039 --> 1285.52
by where the electrons couldn't go

1284.0 --> 1288.159
and then

1285.52 --> 1289.44
it's drawn out

1288.159 --> 1291.679
right

1289.44 --> 1293.919
where there's nothing

1291.679 --> 1296.0
through the readout that's where the

1293.919 --> 1297.679
thing automatically suggested to be and

1296.0 --> 1300.32
guess what

1297.679 --> 1304.72
the intermediate

1300.32 --> 1306.799
3d visualization effect in our brains

1304.72 --> 1308.64
very much uses that because it's very

1306.799 --> 1311.039
easy for us to see

1308.64 --> 1313.44
like the pattern like that and be like

1311.039 --> 1315.44
that's where the molecule is even though

1313.44 --> 1318.0800000000002
technically you only get to see data as

1315.44 --> 1319.679
to where the thing that you're using

1318.08 --> 1322.08
couldn't go

1319.679 --> 1324.48
isn't that interesting yeah

1322.08 --> 1329.52
this worked with me very well that's why

1324.48 --> 1329.52
i kind of trust electron microscopes

1329.6 --> 1333.08
data wise

1334.72 --> 1338.96
i love the stuff

1336.48 --> 1341.3600000000001
this is like the third day in a row but

1338.96 --> 1343.44
it's really doing some good for me and

1341.36 --> 1346.9189999999999
the ginseng i think is really just

1343.44 --> 1346.919
hitting the spot

1348.24 --> 1353.1200000000001
it's helping my peek inside i'm

1350.24 --> 1356.1200000000001
literally noticing that

1353.12 --> 1356.12
hmm

1368.4 --> 1373.52
hmm yeah oh by the way earlier kevlar

1371.2 --> 1376.799
mentioned about moses 10 feet tall yeah

1373.52 --> 1378.96
yeah i know it's so frustrating

1376.799 --> 1382.4
it's like the

1378.96 --> 1385.6000000000001
the old testament lineages they did

1382.4 --> 1388.64
they did notify the height and all that

1385.6 --> 1390.8799999999999
right with adam and eve no no

1388.64 --> 1392.0
there should be data about it

1390.88 --> 1393.2
right

1392.0 --> 1396.4
but it just

1393.2 --> 1396.4
doesn't seem to be there

1396.64 --> 1401.3600000000001
i mean again

1398.72 --> 1405.2
maybe like in the book of giants with

1401.36 --> 1405.1999999999998
some like outtake

1405.52 --> 1410.8799999999999
of adam and eve

1408.32 --> 1410.8799999999999
i don't know

1411.2 --> 1414.64
that's why i'm asking you guys

1414.799 --> 1420.32
because i've never bumped into a height

1417.36 --> 1422.32
notification of adam and eve

1420.32 --> 1424.96
and i was wondering am i the only one

1422.32 --> 1426.72
that has never bumped into that is there

1424.96 --> 1427.919
one

1426.72 --> 1430.48
i mean

1427.919 --> 1433.5200000000002
yeah just why don't you dig through it

1430.48 --> 1435.84
well because i'm really suck i really

1433.52 --> 1437.84
suck at digging through

1435.84 --> 1439.76
books especially the bible i have a lot

1437.84 --> 1441.4399999999998
of trouble finding things in there in

1439.76 --> 1444.08
general

1441.44 --> 1447.43
right somebody's like oh this note this

1444.08 --> 1450.32
that code that name and i'm like

1447.43 --> 1451.76
[Applause]

1450.32 --> 1453.52
okay

1451.76 --> 1457.1589999999999
let me try to find it it might take

1453.52 --> 1457.1589999999999
several minutes

1458.4 --> 1463.6000000000001
and like the bibles have to match too

1460.559 --> 1463.6
etc but anyway

1464.4 --> 1469.0
keep jumping back and forth in subject

1472.48 --> 1476.32
moses wrote genesis

1477.84 --> 1480.84
cool

1491.919 --> 1496.159
just me

1493.36 --> 1499.36
but i don't fully believe anything which

1496.159 --> 1501.44
is or can be understood only by digital

1499.36 --> 1504.8799999999999
computer means

1501.44 --> 1506.88
okay yeah that is just you

1504.88 --> 1508.3200000000002
too much room for interpretation of the

1506.88 --> 1511.0390000000002
data

1508.32 --> 1512.559
false data gathering no no that's the

1511.039 --> 1514.799
thing right

1512.559 --> 1517.84
things like electron microscope readouts

1514.799 --> 1517.84
it's raw data

1518.159 --> 1524.88
raw data represented with the 3d model

1522.159 --> 1529.279
but it is raw data that's not

1524.88 --> 1531.8400000000001
open for interpret well it is

1529.279 --> 1535.12
slightly depending on what you're trying

1531.84 --> 1538.8799999999999
to derive from the information but it is

1535.12 --> 1541.4399999999998
what it is the readout is the readout

1538.88 --> 1543.919
it's not like oh they could just make

1541.44 --> 1545.919
something up show you that right either

1543.919 --> 1548.96
it is a readout and then you'll have

1545.919 --> 1552.24
like the readout data

1548.96 --> 1553.44
on top of a visual representation

1552.24 --> 1555.52
the image

1553.44 --> 1558.3200000000002
or it's just somebody made it in their

1555.52 --> 1559.6
computer and then there is no raw data

1558.32 --> 1561.2
right

1559.6 --> 1563.039
so you always got to distinguish that

1561.2 --> 1565.1200000000001
they always got to sources like oh this

1563.039 --> 1567.76
image oh this is a representation and

1565.12 --> 1568.9599999999998
then it's like okay so is this actually

1567.76 --> 1571.12
based

1568.96 --> 1573.279
on real data

1571.12 --> 1576.08
is the model what they're showing even

1573.279 --> 1578.159
based on anything real what is that

1576.08 --> 1579.6
where did they get that

1578.159 --> 1581.5200000000002
and then okay

1579.6 --> 1583.52
you got a source for where the where

1581.52 --> 1585.44
they got the visualization from the

1583.52 --> 1587.36
representation

1585.44 --> 1589.6000000000001
so is that legitimate then did they

1587.36 --> 1592.0
actually

1589.6 --> 1593.4399999999998
actually find what they say they found

1592.0 --> 1594.64
or is it just

1593.44 --> 1597.2
kind of a

1594.64 --> 1600.88
bit of a

1597.2 --> 1600.88
nonsense process is just

1601.2 --> 1606.799
[ __ ] around and basically conjuring

1604.72 --> 1607.679
the model into existence because you

1606.799 --> 1608.799
just

1607.679 --> 1611.679
need it

1608.799 --> 1612.8799999999999
to find it right

1611.679 --> 1614.3200000000002
that's always

1612.88 --> 1616.159
yeah

1614.32 --> 1618.6399999999999
now that works hey all people free

1616.159 --> 1621.2
people you get a wrench

1618.64 --> 1624.6000000000001
you eat a wrench

1621.2 --> 1624.6000000000001
lots of wrenches

1628.96 --> 1633.039
if paula was here she could probably

1631.12 --> 1634.8799999999999
explain a lot better

1633.039 --> 1636.96
i don't know

1634.88 --> 1640.0
it doesn't really like require

1636.96 --> 1642.72
explanation just like is the data there

1640.0 --> 1644.08
or isn't it is there any notification

1642.72 --> 1646.32
about height

1644.08 --> 1650.1589999999999
of adam and eve or is there not it's

1646.32 --> 1652.96
basically a yes or no question

1650.159 --> 1656.64
right i don't need to hear like oh it's

1652.96 --> 1658.799
some metaphorical representation or not

1656.64 --> 1661.2
that i don't care about that right

1658.799 --> 1664.399
interpretation interpretation fractal

1661.2 --> 1665.8400000000001
consequence of the data yeah i know

1664.399 --> 1667.6789999999999
but i'm not

1665.84 --> 1669.84
inquiring that i

1667.679 --> 1672.3990000000001
i just want to know is there any height

1669.84 --> 1675.279
notification because if there isn't

1672.399 --> 1677.12
then there is this giant interpretation

1675.279 --> 1678.0
gap

1677.12 --> 1679.6789999999999
right

1678.0 --> 1682.96
eve

1679.679 --> 1685.8400000000001
god took a rib from adam and fashioned

1682.96 --> 1687.52
it out into a woman

1685.84 --> 1689.279
so that means

1687.52 --> 1691.2
in my book if

1689.279 --> 1695.12
if you read that literally

1691.2 --> 1697.44
eve is the size of adam's rib

1695.12 --> 1701.52
much smaller

1697.44 --> 1703.3600000000001
that's it that's that's it basically

1701.52 --> 1705.76
yeah of people free people you're

1703.36 --> 1705.76
welcome

1706.799 --> 1711.84

there over the years

1718.84 --> 1725.24
[Music]

1720.08 --> 1725.24
talking about which i could sure use it

1726.48 --> 1729.52
anyone that can spare

1733.36 --> 1737.6789999999999
hey stallion 8012

1735.36 --> 1739.84
looking good today thank you yeah i feel

1737.679 --> 1739.8400000000001
good

1739.919 --> 1743.2
i'm pretty well rested

1744.24 --> 1749.84
also one thing like remember a few days

1747.36 --> 1752.0
ago i had this weird dizziness

1749.84 --> 1754.6399999999999
well i've definitely come to the

1752.0 --> 1758.88
conclusion that it has been like well

1754.64 --> 1758.88
the weed that i had been smoking

1759.36 --> 1762.8799999999999
uh

1760.399 --> 1765.36
it it was too strong it's weird even

1762.88 --> 1768.24
though if i would like downsize the

1765.36 --> 1770.1589999999999
amount it would still just make too much

1768.24 --> 1772.799
impact and kind of leave me dizzy even

1770.159 --> 1776.3200000000002
the next day weird

1772.799 --> 1780.0
but i yeah i changed the type

1776.32 --> 1782.559
and i'm not having that issue anymore

1780.0 --> 1785.2
apparently it was a really unusually

1782.559 --> 1787.76
high thc sort of weed

1785.2 --> 1790.96
but it wasn't expensive so that like i

1787.76 --> 1790.96
didn't realize that

1791.039 --> 1795.84
i had to look that up come on camera

1796.399 --> 1800.7199999999998
[ __ ] sake

1798.32 --> 1800.72
really

1801.52 --> 1804.24
thanks for that

1807.6 --> 1811.1999999999998
thanks for catching me right in a moment

1809.44 --> 1815.3200000000002
where it makes me look like i'm in a gay

1811.2 --> 1815.32
pose that's just great

1833.44 --> 1840.48
right but yeah i'm i'm clear i'm good

1837.679 --> 1842.88
i'm having a bit of haunting moments

1840.48 --> 1844.88
though but yeah it's been kind of like

1842.88 --> 1848.24
that for

1844.88 --> 1848.24
most of my life anyway

1848.799 --> 1854.0
right where i kind of feel overwhelmed

1851.2 --> 1856.88
by the darkness feel like i can't handle

1854.0 --> 1858.799
it this is you this usually this happens

1856.88 --> 1860.3990000000001
like in the night before i go to bed

1858.799 --> 1862.1589999999999
which is also kind of the thing that

1860.399 --> 1864.559
keeps me up

1862.159 --> 1866.0
because i know if i go to bed i'll have

1864.559 --> 1867.519
to face that

1866.0 --> 1870.64
every time

1867.519 --> 1870.64
pretty much every night

1871.44 --> 1875.039
and yeah it's been like that for half my

1874.0 --> 1875.919
life

1875.039 --> 1876.8799999999999
more

1875.919 --> 1880.0800000000002
perhaps

1876.88 --> 1883.2
don't remember how it used to be

1880.08 --> 1887.6
i think i had it less in the past but

1883.2 --> 1890.559
when i did have it it was more terrible

1887.6 --> 1893.12
more like actual nightmare inducing it i

1890.559 --> 1894.96
don't have nightmares like once i sleep

1893.12 --> 1897.4399999999998
i don't have nightmares

1894.96 --> 1899.3600000000001
it's before i go to sleep

1897.44 --> 1902.0800000000002
that's when like

1899.36 --> 1904.84
the darkness kind is like oh hi did you

1902.08 --> 1907.76
forget we are here did you forget how

1904.84 --> 1909.76
absolutely [ __ ] up things are in

1907.76 --> 1911.6
reality

1909.76 --> 1913.76
outside of your comfort zone did you

1911.6 --> 1917.559
forget arwen

1913.76 --> 1917.559
yeah that kinda happens

1920.24 --> 1924.0
not always though

1922.0 --> 1925.76
it's like really pleasant when it

1924.0 --> 1927.279
doesn't happen in the night and because

1925.76 --> 1930.6
then i rest

1927.279 --> 1930.6
very deeply

1938.32 --> 1944.4399999999998
it was actually a good ah yeah fine it's

1941.44 --> 1944.44
just

1974.48 --> 1977.84
where is it

1995.36 --> 1997.6789999999999
man

1998.399 --> 2004.9189999999999
yeah you know what

2000.08 --> 2004.9189999999999
like probably the weirdest stuff is

2006.159 --> 2012.5590000000002
when i get off screen during the show

2007.919 --> 2012.5590000000002
right i sneeze most of the time

2013.44 --> 2017.919
what i don't get is that

2015.679 --> 2020.159
it always keeps happening during my

2017.919 --> 2024.7990000000002
shows like during my

2020.159 --> 2024.7990000000002
live shows right not during fed

2025.36 --> 2031.1999999999998
not during the rest of the day no during

2027.84 --> 2034.399
my shows that's when suddenly i have i

2031.2 --> 2036.48
get like sneezes out of nowhere it's

2034.399 --> 2038.799
it's almost like there's this freaking

2036.48 --> 2040.799
sneeze demon that just like ah

2038.799 --> 2042.799
i'm here i'm gonna [ __ ] up your show

2040.799 --> 2045.6
hahaha

2042.799 --> 2048.399
let me make you sneeze like 20 [ __ ]

2045.6 --> 2049.2799999999997
times every time you have a show every

2048.399 --> 2052.24
day

2049.28 --> 2053.44
every day [ __ ] sneezing every [ __ ]

2052.24 --> 2057.4399999999996
day

2053.44 --> 2057.44
but only during your show because

2057.839 --> 2062.32
because your life is [ __ ] and we're

2060.079 --> 2064.0
here to ensure that despite everything

2062.32 --> 2065.44
you've done

2064.0 --> 2067.919
all the

2065.44 --> 2070.399
grabbing throughout the spirit world

2067.919 --> 2073.1189999999997
that you're reminded that demons are in

2070.399 --> 2078.159
control and we will [ __ ] up your life

2073.119 --> 2078.159
somehow no matter what happens right

2078.72 --> 2083.839
i freaking hate sneezing during my live

2081.44 --> 2085.28
show that's why i literally

2083.839 --> 2087.679
have a routine

2085.28 --> 2090.48
to just never have it on there but it

2087.679 --> 2093.44
doesn't make me stop [ __ ] sneezing

2090.48 --> 2096.159
during the damn show and only during the

2093.44 --> 2096.159
[ __ ] show

2099.52 --> 2105.359
it's not only during the show but it's

2102.32 --> 2108.4
like always during the show

2105.359 --> 2111.119
i mean there's other moments it's like

2108.4 --> 2112.64
suddenly i get the sneezing fit like

2111.119 --> 2116.32
even in the middle of the night but

2112.64 --> 2119.68
that's like not all the time it's always

2116.32 --> 2122.6400000000003
during my freaking show always

2119.68 --> 2125.7599999999998
not during fed no during my show every

2122.64 --> 2127.1189999999997
single time every day every day like

2125.76 --> 2129.2000000000003
pretty much

2127.119 --> 2132.48
since i started the freaking early bird

2129.2 --> 2132.48
show i'm not even joking

2134.32 --> 2138.32
i think overall i must have sneezed like

2136.72 --> 2143.2799999999997
at least

2138.32 --> 2143.28
10 000 times off camera by now

2147.76 --> 2154.119
in the thousands

2149.2 --> 2154.1189999999997
whatever i don't even know why i care

2167.52 --> 2172.96
the useless items lying everywhere

2171.119 --> 2176.32
and then you need him and then you can't

2172.96 --> 2176.32
be you can't find him

2178.4 --> 2185.1600000000003
yeah

2179.92 --> 2185.16
uh yeah i guess you could compare that

2186.079 --> 2191.52
and yes flatter sage after sneezing i do

2188.72 --> 2194.3199999999997
always i do get a rush out of it

2191.52 --> 2196.48
it's just extremely inconvenient during

2194.32 --> 2198.0
the show and i it also does make me

2196.48 --> 2199.76
snotty which is

2198.0 --> 2203.2
not helpful either

2199.76 --> 2203.2000000000003
hey michael khan good to see you

2205.359 --> 2208.839
you get a wrench

2238.72 --> 2244.24
there should be ten thousand watching

2241.52 --> 2249.0
that fellow really 10 000 people

2244.24 --> 2249.0
watching my show live really

2264.72 --> 2270.72
oh yeah great comment by the way earlier

2267.76 --> 2273.76
six minutes ago matthew hall

2270.72 --> 2276.3999999999996
camera freezes

2273.76 --> 2280.7200000000003
either arwen is looking angrily at the

2276.4 --> 2284.4
chat or he's doing a magazine model pose

2280.72 --> 2286.7999999999997
it does kind of seem like that

2284.4 --> 2289.28
that's hilarious

2286.8 --> 2294.28
hello good servant

2289.28 --> 2294.28
hello rp 12 vacation

2306.88 --> 2310.4
right

2307.92 --> 2313.88
i still wonder though like

2310.4 --> 2315.6800000000003
if i had pollen block from

2313.88 --> 2317.839
infowarstore.com i don't know if it's

2315.68 --> 2320.3199999999997
even like if they have that stuff right

2317.839 --> 2321.599
now or that's one of the blocked

2320.32 --> 2324.2400000000002
products

2321.599 --> 2327.119
but it's supposed to help against

2324.24 --> 2327.9199999999996
hay fever yeah

2327.119 --> 2330.0
right

2327.92 --> 2332.4
it's really supposed to help against

2330.0 --> 2334.0
that i've always wondered because that

2332.4 --> 2336.96
product's been out there for a while i

2334.0 --> 2339.2
and i kind of like wanted to

2336.96 --> 2340.7200000000003
order it if i could

2339.2 --> 2342.7999999999997
i haven't ordered anything from

2340.72 --> 2344.7999999999997
infowarstore.com

2342.8 --> 2347.2000000000003
for a long time because of the freaking

2344.8 --> 2349.92
shipping costs and the damn amount of

2347.2 --> 2349.9199999999996
time it takes

2350.4 --> 2356.079
right because it's like

2353.52 --> 2358.079
a lot of extra money just

2356.079 --> 2359.8390000000004
to have it shipped

2358.079 --> 2362.7200000000003
a lot

2359.839 --> 2362.72
and that sucks

2362.96 --> 2366.48
but i've always wondered like would that

2365.52 --> 2369.7599999999998
stuff

2366.48 --> 2372.4
take that freaking sneeze fit thing that

2369.76 --> 2374.1600000000003
i have every single damn show i do would

2372.4 --> 2375.6800000000003
it take it away

2374.16 --> 2378.0789999999997
right

2375.68 --> 2380.7999999999997
it's suggested to help against

2378.079 --> 2383.8390000000004
allergies like

2380.8 --> 2386.8
pollen allergies right

2383.839 --> 2388.88
but yeah it's not like oh man

2386.8 --> 2392.0
every time during my show it's always

2388.88 --> 2394.6400000000003
like i don't even know why i keep these

2392.0 --> 2396.96
highly allergenic flowers

2394.64 --> 2399.52
right next to my computer all the time

2396.96 --> 2401.28
during my shows right no if that were me

2399.52 --> 2403.2
it would be the case i'd be like yeah

2401.28 --> 2404.5600000000004
it's probably the flowers

2403.2 --> 2405.839
but i don't

2404.56 --> 2406.88
so i

2405.839 --> 2410.24
yeah

2406.88 --> 2412.1600000000003
it shouldn't be

2410.24 --> 2413.9199999999996
allergy related

2412.16 --> 2415.1189999999997
what it could be

2413.92 --> 2417.28
or

2415.119 --> 2419.92
the pollen block actually addresses a

2417.28 --> 2422.48
certain part of your body that regulates

2419.92 --> 2425.04
that process

2422.48 --> 2428.4
and that might be the the issue it might

2425.04 --> 2430.96
be tied into my oversensitivity somehow

2428.4 --> 2432.88
that my empathic sensitivity is kind of

2430.96 --> 2436.599
tied in with like the

2432.88 --> 2436.599
sneezing reflex

2439.119 --> 2441.44
right

2443.839 --> 2448.16
so maybe it would help i wonder

2448.48 --> 2451.44
if i'm ever going to order from infowar

2450.48 --> 2452.8
store

2451.44 --> 2454.88
again

2452.8 --> 2458.2400000000002
i'd have to have like a lot of surplus

2454.88 --> 2460.56
money before that becomes worth it

2458.24 --> 2461.839
then i definitely try and get that

2460.56 --> 2463.92
product

2461.839 --> 2465.599
pollen block

2463.92 --> 2468.4
because

2465.599 --> 2470.8
it might actually help

2468.4 --> 2470.8
anyway

2478.16 --> 2480.48
hmm

2479.04 --> 2482.24
no thank you all

2480.48 --> 2486.2400000000002

2509.2 --> 2514.7999999999997
me and what i did

2511.92 --> 2516.8
very close to the depth

2514.8 --> 2519.599
of what i'm actually doing and not just

2516.8 --> 2522.079
like oh it's just crazy irwin right she

2519.599 --> 2525.04
really

2522.079 --> 2528.1600000000003
understood me in a way that most people

2525.04 --> 2528.16
out there didn't

2528.4 --> 2534.839
and i was like

2530.24 --> 2534.839
like well i love you patricia

2539.839 --> 2546.0789999999997
almost in love like but just yeah

2543.68 --> 2547.839
because she just was so great

2546.079 --> 2550.319
therefore a whole bunch of people she

2547.839 --> 2552.319
was really like just bringing so many

2550.319 --> 2554.64
people together

2552.319 --> 2557.839
sometimes a bit crazy people and other

2554.64 --> 2560.7999999999997
times like just great people

2557.839 --> 2560.7999999999997
she would always

2562.72 --> 2568.0
it's like the clan mother

2565.68 --> 2571.5989999999997
that kind of type anyway can't use

2568.0 --> 2571.599
paypal can't access it what

2571.92 --> 2575.2400000000002
what do you mean

2586.88 --> 2592.92
if you really want to try

2588.96 --> 2592.92

okay

2736.319 --> 2740.96
need to update my number

2738.64 --> 2740.96
what

2741.359 --> 2748.0789999999997
well it sometimes asks you to basically

2744.4 --> 2750.88
do confirmation right it's when ooh

2748.079 --> 2753.119
we need extra security so i basically

2750.88 --> 2754.0
put in there like an option like okay

2753.119 --> 2757.04
just

2754.0 --> 2760.16
get a security code through your phone

2757.04 --> 2762.88
thing very basic

2760.16 --> 2765.2799999999997
it rarely does that it did it now like

2762.88 --> 2768.1600000000003
it some you sometimes it just says like

2765.28 --> 2770.1600000000003
oh do that but then it's like not now

2768.16 --> 2772.7999999999997
button you're like yeah okay just skip

2770.16 --> 2775.839
that now it's like no you have to do it

2772.8 --> 2777.92
now right but it's

2775.839 --> 2779.68
it's just a basic thing just sending a

2777.92 --> 2784.0
text message with like a couple of

2779.68 --> 2784.0
numbers on there and type it that's it

2784.16 --> 2787.56
basic stuff

2795.839 --> 2800.24
vanguard blackrock mature ah [ __ ]

2800.38 --> 2803.4790000000003
[Applause]

2815.04 --> 2820.48
yeah the problem about

2817.68 --> 2822.319
yeah things like that black rock owning

2820.48 --> 2823.359
things is that

2822.319 --> 2825.7599999999998
yeah

2823.359 --> 2828.24
they will probably own it in some

2825.76 --> 2830.0
indirect way but the thing is that yeah

2828.24 --> 2832.24
if it's the only thing that actually

2830.0 --> 2833.599
works

2832.24 --> 2835.359
then

2833.599 --> 2836.2400000000002
it could be like oh but there's this

2835.359 --> 2838.7999999999997
thing

2836.24 --> 2840.8799999999997
out there it's different it's not

2838.8 --> 2843.44
owned by blackrock

2840.88 --> 2845.04
well for how long and who is owning it

2843.44 --> 2847.2000000000003
right

2845.04 --> 2850.8
i mean are they highly politicized

2847.2 --> 2852.8799999999997
grabblers that own it instead

2850.8 --> 2854.48
like

2852.88 --> 2858.6400000000003
yeah

2854.48 --> 2862.319
i i just i'm just happy it works for me

2858.64 --> 2866.5989999999997
hasn't really blocked me and

2862.319 --> 2866.599
i hope that stays that way

2874.4 --> 2880.119
had about 10 phone numbers

2877.119 --> 2880.119
what

2890.24 --> 2895.839
but they want a previous phone number to

2893.52 --> 2895.839
oh

2896.079 --> 2899.079
yeah

2900.16 --> 2905.319
yep

2901.599 --> 2905.319
then you got a problem

2922.72 --> 2925.72
do

2934.96 --> 2939.559
who the hell's firing off fireworks

2949.68 --> 2953.0789999999997
that's crazy

2958.96 --> 2965.44
it takes time to get verified right okay

2961.68 --> 2965.44
okay well take your time dude

2966.96 --> 2971.2
i'm really happy that you want to take

2968.559 --> 2972.96
that effort to basically fund me though

2971.2 --> 2975.7599999999998
i really appreciate that

2972.96 --> 2977.359
but yeah take your time

2975.76 --> 2979.8390000000004
like i have

2977.359 --> 2982.4
money for food at this very moment it's

2979.839 --> 2984.88
just like usual over the month the rest

2982.4 --> 2986.48
of the month it's going to run out so

2984.88 --> 2989.6800000000003
right

2986.48 --> 2991.76
so when it comes to donations to our win

2989.68 --> 2995.24
better late than never

2991.76 --> 2995.2400000000002
it's all good

2998.0 --> 3001.96
man i'm loving this stuff

3020.88 --> 3024.7200000000003
okay matthew yeah

3023.28 --> 3027.599
i've had

3024.72 --> 3029.359
similar problems with an eve a very old

3027.599 --> 3032.48
email address

3029.359 --> 3034.88
that i had been using before the google

3032.48 --> 3038.0
email address that i have right now

3034.88 --> 3040.96
i've used that email address for like

3038.0 --> 3043.599
20 years yeah

3040.96 --> 3046.16
very very long

3043.599 --> 3048.319
but like it doesn't exist anymore it it

3046.16 --> 3050.16
literally like

3048.319 --> 3053.119
the website just doesn't exist anymore

3050.16 --> 3053.1189999999997
it was bought up

3053.52 --> 3058.079
by

3054.48 --> 3060.319
another telephone company

3058.079 --> 3062.48
it's like an email address from a

3060.319 --> 3065.44
company that provided internet in the

3062.48 --> 3065.44
late 90s

3065.839 --> 3069.44
was pretty good though

3067.44 --> 3071.359
for its time

3069.44 --> 3073.839
and they're cheap

3071.359 --> 3076.0
but i've been using that email address

3073.839 --> 3078.72
for like forever but now it doesn't

3076.0 --> 3081.52
exist anymore and i've pretty much

3078.72 --> 3084.24
registered almost everything on that so

3081.52 --> 3084.24
i had to like

3084.319 --> 3087.92
quickly change that about

3088.0 --> 3090.96
unfortunately there are things though

3089.599 --> 3093.599
that i just kind of forgotten they

3090.96 --> 3096.079
existed and then later i'm reminded like

3093.599 --> 3097.599
oh yeah we just need this email address

3096.079 --> 3101.52
uh

3097.599 --> 3103.76
yeah that doesn't exist anymore

3101.52 --> 3105.119
that kind of sucks by the way that

3103.76 --> 3108.6400000000003
problem is

3105.119 --> 3112.48
including on like gti

3108.64 --> 3115.44
the crypto thing that yeah it's big

3112.48 --> 3117.92
problem because it's like it's broken

3115.44 --> 3121.52
now in a way

3117.92 --> 3125.2000000000003
it could be unbroken it's just that oh

3121.52 --> 3127.04
automated help desk situation not

3125.2 --> 3129.4399999999996
somebody you're gonna get on the phone

3127.04 --> 3130.72
who can actually fix it

3129.44 --> 3134.079
yeah

3130.72 --> 3136.24
oh digital help desk that's so efficient

3134.079 --> 3140.079
so efficient so cheap

3136.24 --> 3143.04
they just don't [ __ ] do anything

3140.079 --> 3146.96
they just help you how to

3143.04 --> 3146.96
basically navigate things

3147.52 --> 3150.079
right

3148.48 --> 3152.2400000000002
if there's something wrong like yeah

3150.079 --> 3154.71
this email address doesn't exist anymore

3152.24 --> 3157.9199999999996
they just go like

3154.71 --> 3160.96
[Music]

3157.92 --> 3163.599
yeah we can't help you

3160.96 --> 3165.04
yeah that's what [ __ ] happens every

3163.599 --> 3167.44
[ __ ] time

3165.04 --> 3170.319
because digital help desks are kind of

3167.44 --> 3172.48
cute right when you're under staffed

3170.319 --> 3174.64
for actual help desk and there's like a

3172.48 --> 3176.559
lot of numpties that are just like

3174.64 --> 3179.04
oh my computer's broken if you try

3176.559 --> 3181.28
turning it off and on again

3179.04 --> 3183.119
yeah that joke

3181.28 --> 3185.2000000000003
yeah that's

3183.119 --> 3188.4
very cool you know you can use like an

3185.2 --> 3190.96
algorithm help desk figure for that

3188.4 --> 3192.319
it's just that there's other types of

3190.96 --> 3194.559
problems

3192.319 --> 3196.88
that are like oh my email address

3194.559 --> 3200.1600000000003
doesn't exist anymore and you need that

3196.88 --> 3202.7200000000003
email address to change anything

3200.16 --> 3205.04
yeah that's where automated help desks

3202.72 --> 3208.5589999999997
are [ __ ]

3205.04 --> 3211.359
they never help you properly

3208.559 --> 3215.119
seriously has anybody ever had a digital

3211.359 --> 3217.359
help desk figure that could help you

3215.119 --> 3220.079
with an email address that you've used

3217.359 --> 3223.2
to register in their system that doesn't

3220.079 --> 3225.2000000000003
exist anymore have you ever been helped

3223.2 --> 3227.359
by an automated help desk figure that

3225.2 --> 3228.3999999999996
could help you with that ever

3227.359 --> 3231.119
no

3228.4 --> 3232.7200000000003
nobody in the world has ever been

3231.119 --> 3234.8
successfully helped

3232.72 --> 3237.2799999999997
by an algorithm

3234.8 --> 3239.6800000000003
when their email address did that they

3237.28 --> 3245.0400000000004
used to register didn't exist anymore

3239.68 --> 3246.96
it's never been achieved i guarantee it

3245.04 --> 3250.319
i guarantee it

3246.96 --> 3254.079
if you find an example of that

3250.319 --> 3254.079
i'll be absolutely stunned

3258.319 --> 3262.4
they really take the help out of the

3260.16 --> 3264.64
hell desk yeah i agree

3262.4 --> 3268.1600000000003
right it's great though if you're highly

3264.64 --> 3270.8799999999997
understaffed but you should always have

3268.16 --> 3270.8799999999997
an option

3271.28 --> 3275.52
right

3273.2 --> 3277.7599999999998
there should be a threshold system right

3275.52 --> 3279.68
because some people are like i hate

3277.76 --> 3281.8390000000004
automated help this i just want to hear

3279.68 --> 3284.799
a real person and then they proceed to

3281.839 --> 3286.96
absolutely erase that real person's time

3284.799 --> 3289.52
right you don't want that

3286.96 --> 3290.799
so i'd say yeah sure send the automated

3289.52 --> 3293.2
help desk

3290.799 --> 3295.68
and then if it just if things pop up

3293.2 --> 3298.0789999999997
like my email address i used for

3295.68 --> 3299.839
registration doesn't exist anymore then

3298.079 --> 3300.88
it's like

3299.839 --> 3301.92
click

3300.88 --> 3305.28
okay

3301.92 --> 3307.76
here's the real help desk person yeah

3305.28 --> 3311.52
that should be a thing

3307.76 --> 3313.3590000000004
i mean that should be a thing for real

3311.52 --> 3314.48
that should be standardized and i'm

3313.359 --> 3317.2
talking about

3314.48 --> 3318.559
millions and millions of automated help

3317.2 --> 3319.5989999999997
desk systems

3318.559 --> 3321.44
yeah

3319.599 --> 3324.48
soon as somebody says

3321.44 --> 3327.68
the email address i used to register

3324.48 --> 3330.88
here doesn't exist anymore the automated

3327.68 --> 3333.359
help desk should immediately hang up and

3330.88 --> 3335.839
call a real living person help desk

3333.359 --> 3335.839
figure

3335.92 --> 3339.04
that

3336.72 --> 3340.9599999999996
well speaks the native language also

3339.04 --> 3343.92
properly audibly

3340.96 --> 3347.599
right that's my advice that's my

3343.92 --> 3349.839
universal advice to telecom related

3347.599 --> 3351.76
companies

3349.839 --> 3354.48
seriously

3351.76 --> 3357.119
never have a digital help desk only

3354.48 --> 3359.119
system never do that

3357.119 --> 3361.04
it's a disaster

3359.119 --> 3364.0
or a scam

3361.04 --> 3366.48
yeah it's very easy to set up a scam

3364.0 --> 3368.4
with fully automated

3366.48 --> 3370.64
robotic help desk

3368.4 --> 3373.76
figures because they effectively can

3370.64 --> 3376.4
form a bureaucratic wall and people will

3373.76 --> 3378.96
just run dead in the wall

3376.4 --> 3380.0
and then they'll stop inquiring

3378.96 --> 3382.7200000000003
yeah

3380.0 --> 3384.4
so any serious company that has serious

3382.72 --> 3386.8799999999997
help desks

3384.4 --> 3391.04
should always have

3386.88 --> 3393.28
living people behind a phone that that

3391.04 --> 3395.68
is part of that system

3393.28 --> 3398.48
so that if somebody calls in and says

3395.68 --> 3400.5589999999997
yeah the email address i use to register

3398.48 --> 3404.0
here doesn't exist anymore i can't

3400.559 --> 3406.1600000000003
change it that you always get a real

3404.0 --> 3408.72
living person

3406.16 --> 3411.2799999999997
on the line

3408.72 --> 3413.4399999999996
to help you with that

3411.28 --> 3416.88
because freaking

3413.44 --> 3420.64
auto automated algorithm bots they don't

3416.88 --> 3422.48
do that and it's a growing problem more

3420.64 --> 3423.7599999999998
people are coming with this problem

3422.48 --> 3425.52
universally

3423.76 --> 3427.599
old email addresses that people thought

3425.52 --> 3430.319
yeah this is going to live forever right

3427.599 --> 3432.88
nobody knows it it's spam free and then

3430.319 --> 3434.799
suddenly it's like oh yeah it's gonna be

3432.88 --> 3436.1600000000003
cancelled

3434.799 --> 3437.44
yeah that's

3436.16 --> 3439.92
probably

3437.44 --> 3442.4
hundreds of millions of people having

3439.92 --> 3444.2400000000002
these types of issues

3442.4 --> 3445.44
in this time period

3444.24 --> 3449.04
yeah

3445.44 --> 3449.04
it's only going to grow worse

3449.2 --> 3454.799
and it's like it's a it's a dead runner

3452.079 --> 3456.0
it's like it's halts

3454.799 --> 3458.64
the flow

3456.0 --> 3461.119
of the functionality

3458.64 --> 3463.2
whatever it is of the program of the

3461.119 --> 3464.7200000000003
online side of the

3463.2 --> 3467.9199999999996
the store

3464.72 --> 3473.4399999999996
yeah it needs to be fixed universally

3467.92 --> 3476.079
so that's my advice for corporate worlds

3473.44 --> 3476.079
of the day

3483.28 --> 3488.0
if you got a help desk always have a

3485.52 --> 3490.64
real person behind the phone that is

3488.0 --> 3490.64
part of that

3491.04 --> 3495.52
i mean

3492.16 --> 3498.72
bots are just really great

3495.52 --> 3501.7599999999998
but they don't fix everything

3498.72 --> 3504.0
take that into account

3501.76 --> 3504.0
yeah

3504.16 --> 3508.2799999999997
and went back to the chat

3526.079 --> 3531.92
you can feel the back of your brain like

3528.72 --> 3535.2799999999997
it's lit up that sounds like a caffeine

3531.92 --> 3538.079
related hype yeah

3535.28 --> 3538.079
matthew hall

3540.48 --> 3546.64
hey george netanyahu

3543.119 --> 3546.6400000000003
what are you doing here

3556.4 --> 3563.2400000000002
shall we begin begin what squirting in

3560.0 --> 3563.24
my chat

3577.28 --> 3582.6400000000003
face shaving

3579.28 --> 3582.6400000000003
yeah it's fine

3583.04 --> 3587.48
but seriously what are you doing here

3589.44 --> 3595.88
there's no fed life for those that have

3592.079 --> 3595.88
just tuned in

3600.96 --> 3605.599
okay

3602.64 --> 3606.48
yeah that sounds about right two years

3605.599 --> 3610.4
yeah

3606.48 --> 3610.4
looking good yeah i know thanks

3612.72 --> 3617.04
i'm feeling good this is springtime

3619.2 --> 3622.319
and i'm pretty strong

3622.88 --> 3625.88
um

3628.0 --> 3632.4
damn pretty happy with like the crazy

3630.799 --> 3633.68
things that i've been saying in the last

3632.4 --> 3636.1600000000003
few weeks

3633.68 --> 3639.9199999999996
like some of those moments where i like

3636.16 --> 3643.359
really push things in

3639.92 --> 3645.6800000000003
in an unexpected twist

3643.359 --> 3647.44
i always get nervous when that happens

3645.68 --> 3649.839
and it does kind of happen to me it's

3647.44 --> 3651.52
not something even i do it just happens

3649.839 --> 3653.599
to me

3651.52 --> 3654.559
but afterward i'm like

3653.599 --> 3657.44
yeah

3654.559 --> 3660.1600000000003
now that i've more carefully

3657.44 --> 3662.16
thought about it afterward yeah it makes

3660.16 --> 3664.5589999999997
sense what actually happened

3662.16 --> 3666.96
yeah it's weird to be me

3664.559 --> 3668.079
it really is weird to be me things

3666.96 --> 3671.839
happen

3668.079 --> 3671.8390000000004
and then afterward it's like

3672.64 --> 3678.24
what did i just do

3675.119 --> 3681.44
i hope that's that's gonna pan out

3678.24 --> 3681.4399999999996
and then it kind of does

3682.0 --> 3687.119
it's it's almost the case of like yeah i

3684.48 --> 3690.079
am wielding this thing this world this

3687.119 --> 3692.319
reality my plan my ideas

3690.079 --> 3695.76
but i can't fully handle it when it

3692.319 --> 3697.68
happens and i just have to trust that i

3695.76 --> 3700.2400000000002
am

3697.68 --> 3703.04
that it makes sense even though i can't

3700.24 --> 3705.7599999999998
always grasp it in the very second

3703.04 --> 3705.7599999999998
things happen

3705.839 --> 3708.839
eh

3713.52 --> 3720.079
two lenses

3716.0 --> 3720.079
i got both lenses jordan at nuke

3720.4 --> 3725.44
like randy did provide me like with the

3722.88 --> 3728.319
special extra lens that's

3725.44 --> 3731.119
i think it's for

3728.319 --> 3731.119
for sunlight

3732.799 --> 3737.88
yeah i did have an extra lens with it

3740.799 --> 3743.799
so

3759.92 --> 3764.319
a settlement

3761.2 --> 3766.0789999999997
what an argument with who with ranty

3764.319 --> 3769.079
what

3766.079 --> 3769.079
fine

3773.119 --> 3775.839
are you just trying to settle an

3774.799 --> 3778.16
argument

3775.839 --> 3780.96
where somebody's claimed that i sold

3778.16 --> 3782.64
renty's camera again some stupid trolls

3780.96 --> 3785.359
because they do keep saying that you

3782.64 --> 3790.16
know i hope you realize that

3785.359 --> 3790.16
they keep spouting absolute horseshit

3795.68 --> 3801.68
i mean all you really have to do is just

3798.0 --> 3804.96
listen to what i say because i don't lie

3801.68 --> 3804.96
i really don't

3806.0 --> 3809.92
doesn't mean that i'm gonna say things

3807.599 --> 3811.3590000000004
that you can mentally accept for

3809.92 --> 3812.7200000000003
yourself

3811.359 --> 3815.0389999999998
but lie

3812.72 --> 3815.0389999999998
no

3816.48 --> 3823.2
frick where the hell is that thing

3818.88 --> 3823.2000000000003
what there was an extra lens right what

3823.359 --> 3828.64
look

3825.2 --> 3828.64
oh wait maybe it's still on there

3832.24 --> 3836.4399999999996
yeah it's already on there

3838.799 --> 3843.68
right this thing

3841.2 --> 3846.0789999999997
so what did you want

3843.68 --> 3846.0789999999997
to know

3850.48 --> 3856.559
cpl filter

3854.16 --> 3859.359
67 millimeters

3856.559 --> 3862.0
is that what you wanted to know

3859.359 --> 3862.0
top max

3863.599 --> 3867.6400000000003
i don't know if you can see that

3889.2 --> 3893.0789999999997
oh wrong way

3897.839 --> 3900.839
right

3909.28 --> 3913.599
no i don't want to sell my freaking

3911.119 --> 3913.599
camera

3915.2 --> 3921.0389999999998
i'm not selling anything

3918.079 --> 3923.599
i'm done selling [ __ ] yeah

3921.039 --> 3924.7200000000003
i've already sold things in like the

3923.599 --> 3929.6400000000003
last

3924.72 --> 3929.64
decade that i really didn't want to

3940.079 --> 3944.6400000000003
besides i still want to use it at some

3943.52 --> 3945.839
point

3944.64 --> 3947.7599999999998
it's just

3945.839 --> 3950.0789999999997
not this point

3947.76 --> 3952.3190000000004
and i don't want to then buy another

3950.079 --> 3952.319
thing

3961.119 --> 3965.839
300 euros is a good price though

3967.359 --> 3970.52
all right

3984.16 --> 3988.52
polarizing filter yeah

3993.039 --> 3996.559
yeah sorry i called it a lens it's a

3995.039 --> 3998.7200000000003
filter you're right

3996.559 --> 4000.96
it's

3998.72 --> 4004.799
i'm not a professional photographer i

4000.96 --> 4009.119
don't like know every freaking part

4004.799 --> 4009.119
like what it actually is in this cult

4012.559 --> 4016.4
well that's funny my friend in anime

4014.559 --> 4018.799
actually does like she denotes

4016.4 --> 4020.4
everything about cameras

4018.799 --> 4023.599
i've considered at some point just

4020.4 --> 4023.599
giving her that camera

4025.359 --> 4027.5989999999997
but

4028.079 --> 4034.2000000000003
yeah

4030.0 --> 4034.2
if i will not yet

4042.48 --> 4045.48
anyway

4082.4 --> 4088.2400000000002
p 1100 what

4085.599 --> 4089.52
there's a p 1100 now

4088.24 --> 4092.64
damn

4089.52 --> 4097.12
is it bigger or smaller than the p1000

4092.64 --> 4101.12
because the p1000 was like way too heavy

4097.12 --> 4101.12
that thing is just massive

4103.759 --> 4109.359
i mean you could use p-1000s like for

4106.799 --> 4110.48
weight lifting just

4109.359 --> 4112.319
tie them

4110.48 --> 4116.678999999999
to a stick and you could just weight

4112.319 --> 4116.679
lift with that [ __ ] it's so heavy

4122.159 --> 4125.44
burt reynolds what

4127.679 --> 4134.08
i do look better yeah i know i do look

4129.92 --> 4134.08
better because i'm not like

4134.719 --> 4141.759
not drowning in nightmarish terrors

4138.88 --> 4144.400000000001
like i did a couple of years ago pretty

4141.759 --> 4147.04
much during the flat earth talks days

4144.4 --> 4149.44
and all that and where the visions i had

4147.04 --> 4152.64
no idea what that even was

4149.44 --> 4155.599999999999
they all was just coming back to me

4152.64 --> 4158.159000000001
yeah and i had face issues remember like

4155.6 --> 4161.52
skin issues very serious it was like

4158.159 --> 4164.5599999999995
painful and all that because of the just

4161.52 --> 4168.56
the sheer amount of stress and craziness

4164.56 --> 4171.4400000000005
that was just being piled on from behind

4168.56 --> 4172.400000000001
behind my spirit

4171.44 --> 4175.199
yeah

4172.4 --> 4178.0
i've worked through a lot of that in the

4175.199 --> 4180.159
last few pretty much spent every

4178.0 --> 4183.199
every moment just to

4180.159 --> 4183.199
try to fix that

4183.759 --> 4187.88
and it it's worked out

4188.239 --> 4194.44
i mean it took half my life

4191.44 --> 4194.44
almost

4221.76 --> 4226.1990000000005
very useful

4223.199 --> 4226.199
what

4235.12 --> 4237.5199999999995
okay

4240.88 --> 4245.84
yeah see you later george i guess nice

4243.44 --> 4245.839999999999
to see you

4246.96 --> 4251.28
well i don't know about the burt

4248.64 --> 4254.88
reynolds thing though

4251.28 --> 4256.719
doesn't i think it is

4254.88 --> 4259.84
oh yeah that guy

4256.719 --> 4259.84
doesn't look like him

4263.52 --> 4266.52
hmm

4274.96 --> 4277.96
hmm

4286.08 --> 4291.84
that's weird

4287.6 --> 4291.84
i do get it i get the resemblance

4292.8 --> 4295.8
different

4301.679 --> 4305.36
but

4302.48 --> 4307.839999999999
yeah i get it

4305.36 --> 4309.759999999999
that's weird i've never seen that i

4307.84 --> 4312.2390000000005
never saw like oh yeah of course i'm

4309.76 --> 4312.96
burnt rounds but okay

4312.239 --> 4315.839999999999
yeah

4312.96 --> 4315.84
a little

4318.56 --> 4323.120000000001
that's funny

4320.719 --> 4324.8
maybe the mustache like really helps

4323.12 --> 4326.8
with that too

4324.8 --> 4330.08
because bird reynolds has always been

4326.8 --> 4330.08
like a mustache guy

4336.8 --> 4343.84
what are my thoughts on imaginary

4338.719 --> 4343.84
complex numbers are they useful no

4349.76 --> 4355.719
they're conceptual they're there to

4351.44 --> 4355.719
dislocate you from

4356.08 --> 4359.92
from physical grounded thinking pretty

4359.04 --> 4363.36
much

4359.92 --> 4365.6
sure in math you could use it

4363.36 --> 4368.4
should you use it

4365.6 --> 4371.76
should you strive to use it

4368.4 --> 4374.5599999999995
it's like striving to use reification

4371.76 --> 4374.56
in my opinion

4376.48 --> 4381.599999999999
i mean just because it can exist

4378.88 --> 4383.84
conceptually doesn't mean that

4381.6 --> 4386.719
we should try to like

4383.84 --> 4389.52
manifest it or something right

4386.719 --> 4391.92
it's just conceptual

4389.52 --> 4391.92
anyway

4392.96 --> 4397.2390000000005
bird reynolds from in the 70s

4399.28 --> 4405.199
it's kind of funny though because

4402.159 --> 4405.199
i've been called

4405.44 --> 4409.919999999999
like people have like said like i've

4407.92 --> 4413.04
looked like actors

4409.92 --> 4416.96
but not just one like several people

4413.04 --> 4416.96
have called me like steven seagal

4417.84 --> 4423.0
and

4418.96 --> 4423.0
what's the guy's name again

4426.08 --> 4430.96
don't look up

4427.52 --> 4430.96
famous actor damn it

4438.08 --> 4443.04
i'll just give

4440.64 --> 4444.88
leonardo dicaprio

4443.04 --> 4448.719
people have called me that

4444.88 --> 4450.96
and now burt reynolds is like oh

4448.719 --> 4453.12
okay well it's kind of

4450.96 --> 4455.199
i guess

4453.12 --> 4456.239
i guess i should see it as a compliment

4455.199 --> 4459.839999999999
that

4456.239 --> 4459.839999999999
you associate me with that

4463.12 --> 4466.32
i mean

4464.08 --> 4468.8
yeah burt reynolds at least is a kind of

4466.32 --> 4472.08
a badass

4468.8 --> 4474.88
i like because he is like old-fashioned

4472.08 --> 4474.88
and i like that

4477.6 --> 4481.6
it's it's weird though like that

4479.28 --> 4484.159
old-fashioned heart block thing

4481.6 --> 4485.76
i've always liked that it's just that

4484.159 --> 4490.32
when i was younger

4485.76 --> 4490.320000000001
i wouldn't allow myself to admit it

4492.719 --> 4496.719
michael khan from this chat

4495.6 --> 4498.56
no

4496.719 --> 4500.719
no no no no

4498.56 --> 4500.719
no

4502.159 --> 4508.5199999999995
i mean i never wear a hat

4505.52 --> 4508.52
never

4515.76 --> 4520.92
also yeah it's very different eyes and

4517.92 --> 4520.92
nose

4530.88 --> 4534.92
two good looking guys yeah

4549.76 --> 4557.52
yeah matthew i know

4553.6 --> 4559.52
i like bert reynolds he was pretty epic

4557.52 --> 4561.679
in movies like his characters were epic

4559.52 --> 4565.0
and i think the guy was probably like

4561.679 --> 4565.0
that too

4569.76 --> 4573.84
now here's the thing

4571.6 --> 4575.52
if i had never grown a mustache would

4573.84 --> 4578.52
you still think i looked like burt

4575.52 --> 4578.52
reynolds

4581.84 --> 4584.64
think about that

4584.719 --> 4589.36
probably not right

4586.8 --> 4591.679
because it is like a completely

4589.36 --> 4593.759999999999
different thing

4591.679 --> 4596.8
if you have a mustache or not it it

4593.76 --> 4599.52
changes things dramatically it is really

4596.8 --> 4600.719
like a magic

4599.52 --> 4604.2390000000005
thing

4600.719 --> 4605.28
like you have a mustache your mustache

4604.239 --> 4607.199
version

so

5101.92 --> 5104.92
uh

5111.76 --> 5117.52
[Music]

5112.99 --> 5117.5199999999995
[Applause]

5124.88 --> 5128.2390000000005
oh

5127.12 --> 5130.32
right

5128.239 --> 5133.28
anyway

5130.32 --> 5133.28
let's carry on

5136.719 --> 5138.96
yeah

5139.28 --> 5145.199
you know what's weird i've been

5141.04 --> 5146.88
continuing watching lost in space season

5145.199 --> 5150.5599999999995
two

5146.88 --> 5150.56
and i'm shocked

5151.04 --> 5155.84
because

5153.28 --> 5158.4
the anguish that i had to go through in

5155.84 --> 5160.719
the first season

5158.4 --> 5163.599999999999
which is also i guess we

5160.719 --> 5165.92
i don't really like the theme

5163.6 --> 5168.96
at all like the music

5165.92 --> 5171.6
i don't like it like i really don't like

5168.96 --> 5175.28
it it sucks the theme sucks it's just

5171.6 --> 5175.280000000001
dumb i don't like the music

5175.6 --> 5180.4800000000005
but

5177.36 --> 5183.5199999999995
the actors a lot of them have a lot of

5180.48 --> 5185.199
potential and holy [ __ ] that really

5183.52 --> 5187.92
comes through in the second one in the

5185.199 --> 5190.239
second one it's like [ __ ] i really get

5187.92 --> 5191.92
this family feel now

5190.239 --> 5194.48
and they really give it a lot of debt

5191.92 --> 5197.36
like the second season is so

5194.48 --> 5199.36
much better and even the freaking

5197.36 --> 5202.48
antagonist woman

5199.36 --> 5204.159
even though she's like ah you [ __ ] i

5202.48 --> 5207.199
[ __ ] hate you

5204.159 --> 5207.199
that woman is

5207.679 --> 5212.8
a really good

5209.44 --> 5214.799999999999
villain actress like she's

5212.8 --> 5216.56
i'm actually getting respect for how

5214.8 --> 5217.6
terrible she is

5216.56 --> 5220.080000000001
because

5217.6 --> 5223.04
she's really supposed to be terrible and

5220.08 --> 5226.239
the only reason that i'm really agitated

5223.04 --> 5228.639
is that the others aren't more like ah

5226.239 --> 5230.44
i'm gonna strangle you woman

5228.639 --> 5234.56
because she's so

5230.44 --> 5236.08
unbelievably annoying and manipulative

5234.56 --> 5237.92
but

5236.08 --> 5240.96
in the first season it's like too much

5237.92 --> 5242.2390000000005
it's like everybody would be like uh

5240.96 --> 5244.4800000000005
yeah

5242.239 --> 5249.04
no we're just gonna leave you here

5244.48 --> 5249.04
really yeah yeah oh yeah yeah bye

5249.84 --> 5254.719
and just like yeah go [ __ ] yourself you

5252.239 --> 5257.599999999999
[ __ ] psychopath

5254.719 --> 5259.44
like nobody i will not allow the others

5257.6 --> 5262.8
to accidentally start trusting you

5259.44 --> 5264.879999999999
because you are a psycho [ __ ]

5262.8 --> 5267.360000000001
literally

5264.88 --> 5269.84
and that's really annoying the first

5267.36 --> 5272.719
season basically like how things go are

5269.84 --> 5275.12
very annoying because of that that sort

5272.719 --> 5275.12
of thing

5275.36 --> 5281.36
because people like really [ __ ] up

5278.719 --> 5284.88
in the second season

5281.36 --> 5286.159
it's really interesting and even like

5284.88 --> 5289.04
weird

5286.159 --> 5290.799999999999
mcguffin issue with the robot it's still

5289.04 --> 5292.639
super annoying that he talks he should

5290.8 --> 5295.12
they should have just never

5292.639 --> 5297.84
never let it talk ever

5295.12 --> 5297.84
not like that

5298.239 --> 5304.239
but they really like completely turn it

5301.28 --> 5306.159
around in the second season

5304.239 --> 5308.638999999999
it's like oh

5306.159 --> 5311.12
they actually start to go into the

5308.639 --> 5312.8
details as to like where is that thing

5311.12 --> 5314.239
from

5312.8 --> 5317.04
what is it

5314.239 --> 5319.12
it's not really a robot

5317.04 --> 5321.28
i mean it is

5319.12 --> 5322.639
robotic

5321.28 --> 5324.159
electronic

5322.639 --> 5327.1990000000005
somehow

5324.159 --> 5329.04
but they are apparently sort of sentient

5327.199 --> 5331.678999999999
robots

5329.04 --> 5333.28
and yeah in the first season that's like

5331.679 --> 5334.159
oh no

5333.28 --> 5336.4
no

5334.159 --> 5339.12
don't do that

5336.4 --> 5340.799999999999
that's so annoying it's so freaking

5339.12 --> 5343.28
stupid

5340.8 --> 5345.52
robot nostalgia from the 80s when

5343.28 --> 5346.639
everybody was [ __ ] about it so

5345.52 --> 5348.96
annoying

5346.639 --> 5351.04
but in the second season they actually

5348.96 --> 5353.44
kind of like

5351.04 --> 5355.6
give it a proper framework all of a

5353.44 --> 5356.638999999999
sudden really out of nowhere and it was

5355.6 --> 5358.0
like

5356.639 --> 5359.52
oh

5358.0 --> 5361.199
what

5359.52 --> 5363.1990000000005
what

5361.199 --> 5365.5199999999995
okay

5363.199 --> 5367.839999999999
i kind of like the series now

5365.52 --> 5370.320000000001
you just have to like survive the first

5367.84 --> 5371.6
season because that's like there's

5370.32 --> 5374.799999999999
moments in there where you're just like

5371.6 --> 5376.08
oh shut the [ __ ] up

5374.8 --> 5380.08
shut up

5376.08 --> 5382.4
so stupid stop making stupid decisions

5380.08 --> 5382.4
ah

5383.199 --> 5386.239
in the second season

5386.4 --> 5389.36
it's a lot better

5390.56 --> 5394.159000000001
right so yeah

5392.639 --> 5395.92
i'm kind of enjoying it and there's a

5394.159 --> 5397.839999999999
third season even and i'm not even

5395.92 --> 5399.679
halfway the second one so i'm like

5397.84 --> 5400.8
really curious as to where it's going

5399.679 --> 5402.88
it's

5400.8 --> 5405.04
really turning around

5402.88 --> 5407.4400000000005
i had not expected that

5405.04 --> 5409.679
i when i first watched this like it was

5407.44 --> 5410.719
like the sec in the second episode

5409.679 --> 5412.8
episode

5410.719 --> 5415.6
i just stopped watching it because it

5412.8 --> 5418.320000000001
was so annoying to me

5415.6 --> 5421.360000000001
that it just like i hate this i hate

5418.32 --> 5424.639
this freaking entire thing it's so

5421.36 --> 5425.92
stupid everybody's so dumb

5424.639 --> 5428.08
but

5425.92 --> 5428.88
yeah then i basically didn't watch it

5428.08 --> 5430.96
for

5428.88 --> 5433.36
six years

5430.96 --> 5435.36
a long time i haven't watched it

5433.36 --> 5436.719
and now i'm continuing and it's like

5435.36 --> 5438.32
what

5436.719 --> 5439.44
oh

5438.32 --> 5440.88
oh

5439.44 --> 5442.638999999999
okay

5440.88 --> 5445.04
yeah you just have to kind of sit

5442.639 --> 5446.84
through the first season

5445.04 --> 5449.36
try not to

5446.84 --> 5451.4400000000005
like smash your computer or something

5449.36 --> 5453.759999999999
and just get too pissed off that you

5451.44 --> 5456.4
lose all your patience for it

5453.76 --> 5458.2390000000005
sit through it and then yeah after the

5456.4 --> 5459.759999999999
sec after the first season ends it

5458.239 --> 5461.678999999999
actually gets

5459.76 --> 5463.84
a lot better

5461.679 --> 5466.4800000000005
and there's good parts even in the first

5463.84 --> 5471.1990000000005
season but also just terrible things

5466.48 --> 5472.638999999999
that are just like oh my god i hate you

5471.199 --> 5476.759999999999
why

5472.639 --> 5476.76
why are you so stupid

5478.32 --> 5480.719
anyway

5483.36 --> 5486.96
good actors when they make you hate them

5486.0 --> 5489.679
yeah

5486.96 --> 5491.199
well that antagonist woman

5489.679 --> 5496.159
she is

5491.199 --> 5498.96
she is like really [ __ ] despisable

5496.159 --> 5500.5599999999995
and she's like real she's a method actor

5498.96 --> 5502.8
man

5500.56 --> 5505.84
she's like really

5502.8 --> 5505.84
she's like

5506.56 --> 5511.1990000000005
she really makes the worst come out in

5508.56 --> 5513.84
people i think

5511.199 --> 5516.719
in the viewers because the people that

5513.84 --> 5519.4400000000005
are actually there

5516.719 --> 5522.56
the the fellow actors

5519.44 --> 5524.08
or the characters they just

5522.56 --> 5526.639
they're all too

5524.08 --> 5527.84
too nice they're too nice they're too

5526.639 --> 5529.84
polite

5527.84 --> 5532.4800000000005
like they don't understand this is a

5529.84 --> 5535.1990000000005
psycho [ __ ] not just a

5532.48 --> 5539.12
oh she's just morally

5535.199 --> 5541.28
dubious no she's a [ __ ] psycho [ __ ]

5539.12 --> 5543.44
and not just because you get to see a

5541.28 --> 5546.08
couple of scenes where she really does

5543.44 --> 5547.04
psycho [ __ ] no she talks like a psycho

5546.08 --> 5550.239
[ __ ]

5547.04 --> 5553.12
she's constantly manipulating people's

5550.239 --> 5554.718999999999
feelings like really overtly and you're

5553.12 --> 5556.4
like dude

5554.719 --> 5558.4
dude

5556.4 --> 5561.12
like why

5558.4 --> 5564.08
why do you think

5561.12 --> 5564.88
any engagement any form is gonna help

5564.08 --> 5567.28
you

5564.88 --> 5570.2390000000005
and then yeah eventually she actually

5567.28 --> 5571.199
starts abusing that for real

5570.239 --> 5572.879999999999
and then

5571.199 --> 5575.04
because they basically

5572.88 --> 5577.1990000000005
like just let her

5575.04 --> 5579.199
hang around and then she saves

5577.199 --> 5581.678999999999
situations

5579.199 --> 5585.199
because they have nowhere else to go

5581.679 --> 5587.36
and she just totally [ __ ] abuses that

5585.199 --> 5589.759999999999
to the max

5587.36 --> 5592.08
and keeps doing that she's like a real

5589.76 --> 5594.400000000001
serious villain character actually

5592.08 --> 5596.48
that's sort of neutral

5594.4 --> 5599.199
whatever but she's a real [ __ ]

5596.48 --> 5601.678999999999
villain despite all of that

5599.199 --> 5603.599999999999
i don't know

5601.679 --> 5606.0
oh you have a wrench yes you do i'm

5603.6 --> 5606.0
appeal

5607.12 --> 5613.28
lost in non-existent space yeah yeah

5611.04 --> 5615.679
no but i really liked it overall because

5613.28 --> 5618.719
there is a lot of the things that i like

5615.679 --> 5620.2390000000005
about space fantasy

5618.719 --> 5622.2390000000005
exploration

5620.239 --> 5626.32
and survival

5622.239 --> 5628.799999999999
like survival in space is epic

5626.32 --> 5632.0
it's what made

5628.8 --> 5634.4800000000005
firefly series so incredibly good is the

5632.0 --> 5637.04
survival aspect it's what made the

5634.48 --> 5640.48
martian so incredibly good

5637.04 --> 5643.199
the survival aspect that stuff is epic i

5640.48 --> 5645.839999999999
love that i love that

5643.199 --> 5648.5599999999995
that just that surreal challenge

5645.84 --> 5650.32
factor and mysterious places trying to

5648.56 --> 5654.080000000001
figure out what's going i love that i

5650.32 --> 5656.96
love it and lost in space the series has

5654.08 --> 5659.44
a lot of that it is really an

5656.96 --> 5661.44
exploration type of adventure

5659.44 --> 5664.08
and i freaking love it

5661.44 --> 5664.08
that part

5664.4 --> 5669.07
i don't like a freaking robot that says

5666.88 --> 5670.2390000000005
does your real rob is in danger

5669.07 --> 5673.759999999999
[Music]

5670.239 --> 5676.799999999999
so annoying shut the [ __ ] up

5673.76 --> 5676.8
i don't like that

5681.36 --> 5687.119
but yeah

5683.199 --> 5690.719
i i don't like the the kitty space [ __ ]

5687.119 --> 5691.92
the rest of it i think is pretty epic

5690.719 --> 5694.08
like

5691.92 --> 5696.4
the family unit

5694.08 --> 5700.239
survival because it is kind of

5696.4 --> 5703.199
homesteading in space guys lit yeah yeah

5700.239 --> 5707.36
you realize that lost in space in its

5703.199 --> 5708.719
own way is kind of homesteading in space

5707.36 --> 5711.199
yeah

5708.719 --> 5713.6
it is it really is

5711.199 --> 5716.08
it really is

5713.6 --> 5718.400000000001
literally that

5716.08 --> 5720.0
and it is all about like yeah kids

5718.4 --> 5722.08
different age ranges different

5720.0 --> 5723.36
challenges and and parents it's all

5722.08 --> 5725.92
about the parents and what are they

5723.36 --> 5730.639
doing i really think

5725.92 --> 5732.88
the parents characters are freaking epic

5730.639 --> 5735.119
i kind of love him

5732.88 --> 5736.88
i kind of love the dad character i kind

5735.119 --> 5739.199
of love the mother character i really

5736.88 --> 5741.04
have respect for them and how they put

5739.199 --> 5743.04
how they were put together how they were

5741.04 --> 5745.6
put on the map there in the series it

5743.04 --> 5745.6
just like

5748.08 --> 5750.48
anyway

5752.719 --> 5757.76
the martian was the best sci-fi film of

5755.04 --> 5760.48
the last decade it was good

5757.76 --> 5762.2390000000005
it was very good yes i agree it was

5760.48 --> 5764.718999999999
better than i expected than when i

5762.239 --> 5765.839999999999
started to watch it turned out great i

5764.719 --> 5767.28
agree

5765.84 --> 5768.88
although

5767.28 --> 5771.04
i still think that

5768.88 --> 5774.639
interstellar

5771.04 --> 5774.639
was the most mind-blowing

5775.04 --> 5779.92
especially because of just the time when

5777.36 --> 5782.48
it arrived and just the music they used

5779.92 --> 5782.4800000000005
it's so

5782.96 --> 5789.52
it it reaches very deep

5786.719 --> 5792.08
it really reaches into like emotional

5789.52 --> 5795.76
things for me too

5792.08 --> 5795.76
it's very good drama

5796.96 --> 5801.52
right so yeah for me nothing has really

5799.44 --> 5805.199
beaten interstellar yet

5801.52 --> 5806.56
nor would i want something to

5805.199 --> 5809.28
like

5806.56 --> 5811.280000000001
interstellar is really interstellar and

5809.28 --> 5813.679
like

5811.28 --> 5815.36
if something yeah just like just kind of

5813.679 --> 5817.6
leave it alone you know there's so many

5815.36 --> 5818.799999999999
other venues directions you can take

5817.6 --> 5819.76
space

5818.8 --> 5822.4800000000005
things

5819.76 --> 5827.1990000000005
i really think that space survival is

5822.48 --> 5829.5199999999995
probably the most durable theme for

5827.199 --> 5832.0
for hollywood to keep exploring

5829.52 --> 5833.84
because all of movies all the space

5832.0 --> 5837.04
movies that had

5833.84 --> 5839.52
survival team

5837.04 --> 5842.8
thing like individual survival or team

5839.52 --> 5844.4800000000005
survival in space on foreign planets and

5842.8 --> 5846.719
maybe keeping on the move

5844.48 --> 5848.959999999999
i think that that is actually

5846.719 --> 5851.84
one of the most viable

5848.96 --> 5851.84
entertainment

5852.84 --> 5858.8
frequencies for space movies into the

5855.679 --> 5860.4
future for a while

5858.8 --> 5864.28
that's my

5860.4 --> 5864.28
professional opinion

5872.88 --> 5878.56
you were going to subscribe to me

5876.32 --> 5878.5599999999995
well

5880.239 --> 5886.159
is that is that the gay guy again that i

5883.76 --> 5888.320000000001
banned earlier

5886.159 --> 5888.32
no

5889.119 --> 5893.679
yeah well yeah if you want to comment

5891.76 --> 5897.2390000000005
in my chat you'll have to subscribe to

5893.679 --> 5897.2390000000005
me that's correct

5906.88 --> 5911.400000000001
hey matthew hall what are you talking

5908.4 --> 5911.4
about

5918.8 --> 5924.0
lost in space was on at sunday dinner

5921.52 --> 5927.360000000001
times when i was a kid along with land

5924.0 --> 5928.48
of the giants you mean the movie

5927.36 --> 5931.679
right

5928.48 --> 5934.799999999999
there's a very old movie lost in space

5931.679 --> 5937.76
then there's like the

5934.8 --> 5939.92
the manure sci-fi movie which was at the

5937.76 --> 5942.0
time when it came out really unpopular

5939.92 --> 5945.92
and it's not perfect there's still very

5942.0 --> 5945.92
likable things about that movie though

5946.8 --> 5949.92
right

5947.92 --> 5952.639
but this series is a netflix series

5949.92 --> 5954.96
that's much later

5952.639 --> 5956.719
i think it's like

5954.96 --> 5958.719
maybe a little over a decade old or

5956.719 --> 5960.88
something

5958.719 --> 5960.88
so

5962.88 --> 5968.2390000000005
you just subscribed okay thank you i

5965.28 --> 5970.48
scoobed

5968.239 --> 5970.48
okay

5974.08 --> 5979.0
but matthew hall who are you talking to

5982.159 --> 5984.799999999999
oh emma

5986.239 --> 5990.08
emma p oh you're talking about m appeal

5990.639 --> 5995.84
she creates content but not subs what

5997.28 --> 6000.719
yeah you don't have videos

6000.96 --> 6004.88
you do have a very

6003.28 --> 6009.08
very pretty

6004.88 --> 6009.08
picture of your face though

6012.48 --> 6018.159
original series from the 60s

6015.36 --> 6019.839999999999
was that this series

6018.159 --> 6023.04
oh

6019.84 --> 6026.32
i thought it was an old movie

6023.04 --> 6028.8
would 60 gallons be sufficient

6026.32 --> 6030.799999999999
wasn't that a movie it was a series you

6028.8 --> 6035.8
say

6030.8 --> 6035.8
or was there another series i don't know

6048.48 --> 6051.48
hmm

6062.0 --> 6068.4
no the old series okay so the oh yeah

6064.32 --> 6068.4
it's a series not a movie okay okay

6075.28 --> 6080.96
you've already seen the netflix okay so

6078.08 --> 6083.92
do you agree with me michael khan

6080.96 --> 6086.159
about it so far how freaking annoying

6083.92 --> 6088.56
the first season is in waze

6086.159 --> 6091.44
but that after the second season it

6088.56 --> 6095.280000000001
really it starts to grow on me at least

6091.44 --> 6097.199
did did that happen to you too

6095.28 --> 6099.04
yeah dr smith was a man in the old

6097.199 --> 6101.678999999999
series probably

6099.04 --> 6103.84
and in the movie too which i thought he

6101.679 --> 6105.679
was like the best character in there

6103.84 --> 6106.400000000001
he's the same guy

6105.679 --> 6108.4
that

6106.4 --> 6109.28
plays like

6108.4 --> 6111.36
the

6109.28 --> 6113.599999999999
villain in the fifth element

6111.36 --> 6116.08
and he was so good

6113.6 --> 6120.92
that guy is like the most

6116.08 --> 6120.92
lovable villain bastard ever

6122.159 --> 6126.36
yeah you loved it okay cool

6139.84 --> 6146.88
yeah and in the movie

6142.88 --> 6149.84
dr smith like turns into like a giant

6146.88 --> 6149.84
spider thing

6154.8 --> 6158.88
he was a pretty amazing character in

6156.639 --> 6158.88
that

6160.239 --> 6165.759999999999
i mean this this lady

6162.8 --> 6167.6
dr smith here in the in the newer

6165.76 --> 6170.56
netflix series

6167.6 --> 6173.6
is a really a separate thing

6170.56 --> 6176.96
like is she's like a mega grifter like a

6173.6 --> 6178.8
real psycho grifter

6176.96 --> 6181.119
and

6178.8 --> 6184.56
yeah at first it's like totally out of

6181.119 --> 6186.719
place like dude what the [ __ ]

6184.56 --> 6186.719
but

6187.44 --> 6192.96
i guess they all grow into it and i

6190.56 --> 6196.8
think that in the second season is like

6192.96 --> 6196.8
yeah it all makes more sense

6197.6 --> 6201.6
and yeah even her as a villain is

6200.0 --> 6203.36
starting to grow on me although it's

6201.6 --> 6204.639
just like i really

6203.36 --> 6208.639
like

6204.639 --> 6208.639
the guy from the movie

6208.8 --> 6212.8
i forget his name but he's like so

6211.52 --> 6215.040000000001
awesome

6212.8 --> 6216.400000000001
even when he's evil he's just awesome

6215.04 --> 6218.719
evil right

6216.4 --> 6221.36
this woman is like it really makes me

6218.719 --> 6223.6
want to strangle it's like i hate you i

6221.36 --> 6225.679
freaking hate you everything you say is

6223.6 --> 6228.4800000000005
so disgusting

6225.679 --> 6230.96
so annoyingly manipulative like you have

6228.48 --> 6233.36
absolutely no respect for people's inner

6230.96 --> 6235.119
workings at all you just want to program

6233.36 --> 6237.92
them you just want to program them like

6235.119 --> 6240.719
robots you really don't care about

6237.92 --> 6244.8
people's feelings at all

6240.719 --> 6244.8
disgusting i really hate her

6245.04 --> 6250.719
yeah have i ever tried acting

6248.88 --> 6253.76
i am an actor

6250.719 --> 6253.76
my life is an act

6254.159 --> 6260.92
that but i'm acting here a bit

6256.639 --> 6260.92
gary old yeah yeah yeah

6261.04 --> 6264.4
gary oldman is epic

6264.88 --> 6268.8
i pretty much like every movie in which

6267.28 --> 6273.32
he plays

6268.8 --> 6273.320000000001
doesn't really matter what he does

6279.36 --> 6285.04
i would make a great movie carrick yeah

6281.28 --> 6287.44
but if i do that then i become

6285.04 --> 6288.639
yeah then the

6287.44 --> 6290.48
you know

6288.639 --> 6292.719
the problem with me is if i'd be an

6290.48 --> 6294.799999999999
actor i'd probably like become that

6292.719 --> 6296.639
actor and become a trope about that

6294.8 --> 6298.96
actor and if just everybody would just

6296.639 --> 6302.0
see me as that

6298.96 --> 6304.32
specific character

6302.0 --> 6304.32
right

6307.44 --> 6310.96
this is a big problem for a lot of

6309.04 --> 6312.8
actors is that if they're really

6310.96 --> 6314.8
successful in a certain character then

6312.8 --> 6316.4800000000005
suddenly everybody starts to see them as

6314.8 --> 6318.2390000000005
that character

6316.48 --> 6321.919999999999
unless they've already kind of

6318.239 --> 6323.44
manifested a wide range of characters

6321.92 --> 6324.719
that had potential

6323.44 --> 6326.239
and then it can

6324.719 --> 6327.679
yeah then there's they still have

6326.239 --> 6330.0
dynamics

6327.679 --> 6334.4
dynamic space enough left in people's

6330.0 --> 6336.639
minds to also become other characters

6334.4 --> 6336.638999999999
right

6337.04 --> 6341.679
but i don't know if i'm a good actor i

6339.199 --> 6344.96
don't think so man acting is

6341.679 --> 6348.96
is really tough

6344.96 --> 6352.08
it's tough work it really is also

6348.96 --> 6354.159
i'm not really good at memorizing things

6352.08 --> 6355.36
as you will know i pretty much improvise

6354.159 --> 6359.119
everything

6355.36 --> 6360.96
well that makes you really inconvenient

6359.119 --> 6364.4
for a director

6360.96 --> 6367.119
right unless you are like critical and

6364.4 --> 6369.119
he's like the director is like yeah

6367.119 --> 6371.679
yeah we know you improvise everything

6369.119 --> 6374.4
just improvise the way you do

6371.679 --> 6375.4400000000005
we'll build things around that

6374.4 --> 6377.04
right

6375.44 --> 6379.36
that could work but

6377.04 --> 6381.6
yeah what director is gonna do that with

6379.36 --> 6384.4
somebody that is literally not on the

6381.6 --> 6386.719
map you know

6384.4 --> 6388.5599999999995
so you then have to be connected or like

6386.719 --> 6390.56
it's not gonna work i don't think i'm

6388.56 --> 6392.56
ever gonna really

6390.56 --> 6394.719
like why would i want to anyway at this

6392.56 --> 6399.280000000001
point it's like they're all freaking gay

6394.719 --> 6399.28
and disgusting and political and ugh

6399.52 --> 6403.84
i i don't really want to be an actor at

6401.92 --> 6406.8
this point

6403.84 --> 6406.8
i'll just do this

6413.44 --> 6417.119
gary coleman gary old what

6426.56 --> 6429.56
no

6432.0 --> 6437.719
what the hell is gary coleman you have

6434.239 --> 6437.718999999999
to do with anything

6447.76 --> 6451.52
sometimes method acting affects the

6450.159 --> 6453.44
actors

6451.52 --> 6457.76
no no

6453.44 --> 6461.5199999999995
usually method acting affects the actors

6457.76 --> 6463.52
not sometimes it usually does

6461.52 --> 6466.400000000001
right that's the whole point it's full

6463.52 --> 6470.320000000001
immersion it becomes real

6466.4 --> 6473.44
yeah when you make something real to you

6470.32 --> 6475.84
then it will have influence on you as if

6473.44 --> 6477.919999999999
it were real i know everything about

6475.84 --> 6478.8
that

6477.92 --> 6480.2390000000005
i

6478.8 --> 6483.119000000001
do it

6480.239 --> 6483.119
automatically

6483.679 --> 6487.04
i'm always asking oh okay

6495.52 --> 6501.6
okay yeah getting gary coleman

6498.88 --> 6505.159000000001
mixed up with gary altman is like mixing

6501.6 --> 6505.159000000001
up duo penatti

6519.6 --> 6522.6
okay

6554.719 --> 6561.08
yeah yeah i get that

6556.639 --> 6561.08
steve traveler that's all right

6578.239 --> 6581.239
ah

6599.76 --> 6603.04
yeah matthew

6601.04 --> 6606.48
why would you drink pepsi

6603.04 --> 6606.48
like why would you even do that

6608.239 --> 6614.48
no it's not weird getting a reaction

6611.119 --> 6617.04
from pepsi that stuff is [ __ ] up

6614.48 --> 6619.919999999999
dude do you even realize that pepsi

6617.04 --> 6623.04
unapologetically

6619.92 --> 6625.119
uses aborted fetus cells for flavor

6623.04 --> 6629.28
enhancement

6625.119 --> 6629.28
it's been there for like a decade

6629.679 --> 6632.8
like

6630.48 --> 6634.239
that [ __ ] is cursed man

6632.8 --> 6636.320000000001
like

6634.239 --> 6639.199
you know how you can bless water and all

6636.32 --> 6641.119
that i can i can bless water it actually

6639.199 --> 6644.32
becomes different yeah

6641.119 --> 6646.799999999999
or you can also curse water yeah

6644.32 --> 6650.32
i wouldn't drink a pepsi

6646.8 --> 6652.56
even if the alternative would be like

6650.32 --> 6656.48
dehydration starvation

6652.56 --> 6658.639
i i like no that's not for consumption

6656.48 --> 6661.04
it's evil

6658.639 --> 6663.92
it's disgusting

6661.04 --> 6667.84
i don't know why you would do that to

6663.92 --> 6667.84
yourself matthew hall

6674.159 --> 6679.839999999999
sorry about it you did it to yourself

6676.0 --> 6683.44
man i'm just informing you what it is

6679.84 --> 6686.0
yeah aborted fetus cells really yes by

6683.44 --> 6688.08
their own admission

6686.0 --> 6692.36
yeah why don't you look it up

6688.08 --> 6692.36
i bet you could google it still

6694.159 --> 6698.799999999999
i knew that in 2010 am appeal

6708.639 --> 6714.0
yeah god has very little to do with it

6711.599 --> 6716.639
emma people

6714.0 --> 6719.639
it's just really [ __ ] up disgusting

6716.639 --> 6719.639
people

6730.56 --> 6736.320000000001
when you bless water does it change its

6732.56 --> 6738.56
molecular structure in some way

6736.32 --> 6738.5599999999995
no

6741.599 --> 6744.719
i mean

6742.719 --> 6747.28
effectively

6744.719 --> 6749.44
if you then force it to

6747.28 --> 6751.84
form a crystal structure

6749.44 --> 6752.719
right like freezing it

6751.84 --> 6754.32
then

6752.719 --> 6757.04
yes

6754.32 --> 6758.08
it will actually alter

6757.04 --> 6761.199
the way

6758.08 --> 6763.04
things crystallize like water right but

6761.199 --> 6766.799999999999
when it's in a fluid state it doesn't do

6763.04 --> 6770.08
that but its crystallization potential

6766.8 --> 6772.719
will be altered by blessing or cursing

6770.08 --> 6775.679
dr emoto

6772.719 --> 6778.08
with his water freezing tests proved

6775.679 --> 6779.52
that in a very direct sense right

6778.08 --> 6781.44
because that's what it is it's the

6779.52 --> 6783.040000000001
intention it's the intention that you

6781.44 --> 6785.919999999999
give something

6783.04 --> 6787.199
you can bless or curse water just with

6785.92 --> 6791.1990000000005
intention

6787.199 --> 6793.36
and it already has a crystallizing

6791.199 --> 6795.5199999999995
aberrant effect it will crystallize

6793.36 --> 6797.28
differently just by

6795.52 --> 6799.92
basic attention

6797.28 --> 6801.92
by basic sensory

6799.92 --> 6804.639
that you project onto it with your

6801.92 --> 6804.639
consciousness

6804.88 --> 6807.84
right

6808.56 --> 6812.320000000001
so yeah while it's liquid it's not

6810.159 --> 6814.879999999999
changing its molecular structure but its

6812.32 --> 6817.88
crystallization potential yes that

6814.88 --> 6817.88
changes

6836.4 --> 6840.08
if you can bless water you should sell

6838.32 --> 6842.32
holy water

6840.08 --> 6842.32
no

6847.679 --> 6851.4400000000005
no

6849.599 --> 6854.08
no i'll leave that sort of [ __ ] to the

6851.44 --> 6854.08
catholics

6854.159 --> 6858.5599999999995
no

6855.52 --> 6858.56
you could just do it

6859.04 --> 6863.76
just do it just bless it yeah there's a

6861.679 --> 6866.159
whole tradition even with christians to

6863.76 --> 6868.320000000001
bless your food before eating it

6866.159 --> 6872.5599999999995
why do you think to do that could it be

6868.32 --> 6874.639
because it actually does something good

6872.56 --> 6876.639
when you project your intentions your

6874.639 --> 6877.4400000000005
good intentions and your thankfulness

6876.639 --> 6879.679
and

6877.44 --> 6883.04
gratitude and hope

6879.679 --> 6886.159
yeah it does actually do something good

6883.04 --> 6886.159
it changes these

6886.8 --> 6891.04
structural potential

6889.199 --> 6892.0
of the material

6891.04 --> 6893.599
not

6892.0 --> 6895.119
it doesn't alter

6893.599 --> 6897.360000000001
the material like

6895.119 --> 6899.598999999999
chemical alteration

6897.36 --> 6901.598999999999
but it does change the structure

6899.599 --> 6904.08
structural potential

6901.599 --> 6906.639
and that has a probably positive

6904.08 --> 6906.639
influence

6911.44 --> 6915.678999999999
right yeah the thing about blessing and

6913.679 --> 6916.84
then selling water is you know what

6915.679 --> 6919.36
happens

6916.84 --> 6922.8
eventually you'll stop blasting the

6919.36 --> 6924.88
water and then projecting greed onto the

6922.8 --> 6926.320000000001
water instead

6924.88 --> 6928.400000000001
yeah

6926.32 --> 6931.5199999999995
that's the problem

6928.4 --> 6933.598999999999
when you actually use pure

6931.52 --> 6935.1990000000005
innocent

6933.599 --> 6937.1990000000005
intentions

6935.199 --> 6939.119
and then you think hey i could profit

6937.199 --> 6940.638999999999
from this yeah guess what's gonna

6939.119 --> 6942.96
replace

6940.639 --> 6945.52
that power

6942.96 --> 6948.32
yeah that's why i don't

6945.52 --> 6950.96
sell my powers like that the i can oh

6948.32 --> 6953.92
they ca i can only keep them

6950.96 --> 6955.44
if i give it away for free you see

6953.92 --> 6957.119
that's the problem

6955.44 --> 6960.239
it's not a problem though it's the

6957.119 --> 6962.799999999999
condition that's just how it works

6960.239 --> 6964.959999999999
if i'd start selling my ability i'd lose

6962.8 --> 6964.96
it

6965.679 --> 6969.119
right

6967.36 --> 6972.159
i can only give it away for free and

6969.119 --> 6974.48
then hope that people will

6972.159 --> 6978.598999999999
get me something back

6974.48 --> 6978.598999999999
that's as far as i can go

6990.8 --> 6995.599
i still pray before i eat

6992.88 --> 6997.599
well i don't pray before i eat but i

6995.599 --> 6998.88
absolutely

6997.599 --> 7000.32
project

6998.88 --> 7002.96
hope and love

7000.32 --> 7004.0
and thankfulness to my food and every

7002.96 --> 7006.159
food it's

7004.0 --> 7007.36
every food i eat

7006.159 --> 7009.44
like

7007.36 --> 7012.159
like it could be my last

7009.44 --> 7014.799999999999
i'm not that dramatic but

7012.159 --> 7017.119
i do keep it in mind like yeah who knows

7014.8 --> 7021.04
maybe this is my last meal

7017.119 --> 7021.04
better better make the best of it

7021.28 --> 7026.0
not spill it not just take it for

7023.599 --> 7028.159000000001
granted not just oh i gotta eat it again

7026.0 --> 7029.92
no if that's the case if you end up in a

7028.159 --> 7031.119
place where you're like oh god not this

7029.92 --> 7032.96
again

7031.119 --> 7034.799999999999
then it's kind of time to change your

7032.96 --> 7036.8
meal then it's time to change your

7034.8 --> 7038.08
routine and get something else because

7036.8 --> 7040.159000000001
it's not good

7038.08 --> 7042.4
to have that response

7040.159 --> 7044.5599999999995
right that intention is gonna then rub

7042.4 --> 7047.5199999999995
off on the food and then suddenly there

7044.56 --> 7049.84
is no more thankfulness

7047.52 --> 7052.2390000000005
yeah and it's natural you can't help you

7049.84 --> 7054.8
can't force to be thankful for something

7052.239 --> 7056.799999999999
that you just are really sick of because

7054.8 --> 7058.2390000000005
it's always the same or something right

7056.8 --> 7059.84
or something wrong with it you can do

7058.239 --> 7061.678999999999
anything about it

7059.84 --> 7064.32
you can't just force yourself to be

7061.679 --> 7066.639
thankful it has to actually

7064.32 --> 7067.92
naturally manifest otherwise it's not

7066.639 --> 7071.159000000001
going to work then you're just trying to

7067.92 --> 7071.159
fool yourself

7072.239 --> 7074.48
right

7075.28 --> 7080.48
honest intention requires

7079.04 --> 7081.44
purity

7080.48 --> 7085.239
not

7081.44 --> 7085.239
forceful dedication

7098.84 --> 7104.32
oh jesus said they put it in gatorade

7102.32 --> 7107.119
too that's

7104.32 --> 7107.119
lace chips

7109.199 --> 7111.598999999999
damn

7112.08 --> 7116.639
okay well it's good that i don't

7115.599 --> 7119.679
ever

7116.639 --> 7122.159000000001
ever buy something that's not from a an

7119.679 --> 7122.96
organic only brand

7122.159 --> 7124.239
like

7122.96 --> 7126.56
never

7124.239 --> 7129.28
except for candy that literally doesn't

7126.56 --> 7130.2390000000005
exist in organic brands because

7129.28 --> 7132.719
people

7130.239 --> 7135.759999999999
think you're crazy if you like that

7132.719 --> 7135.76
like pure salt

7138.239 --> 7141.598999999999
lacquer salt right

7139.92 --> 7142.4
there's no organic variety of that

7141.599 --> 7144.2390000000005
because

7142.4 --> 7145.679
it's salt

7144.239 --> 7147.839999999999
right

7145.679 --> 7147.84
but

7148.56 --> 7154.4800000000005
dude i didn't know it's like spread out

7150.88 --> 7157.84
that far that's really gross

7154.48 --> 7157.839999999999
i thought it was just pepsi

7158.639 --> 7161.639
damn

7176.0 --> 7181.28
do i ever question what you read on the

7178.8 --> 7185.4800000000005
internet or in chi da

7181.28 --> 7185.48
what do you think i'm doing right now

7186.48 --> 7191.759999999999
i mean if so somebody's just blabbering

7189.28 --> 7191.759999999999
something

7193.04 --> 7198.239
and obviously making it up or pulling it

7195.679 --> 7200.4800000000005
out of their ass i usually catch on not

7198.239 --> 7202.48
always though sometimes i'm a little

7200.48 --> 7205.5199999999995
late to the party

7202.48 --> 7208.48
i do tend to like just take people for

7205.52 --> 7210.56
their word at first at least

7208.48 --> 7212.959999999999
also people say stupid things and don't

7210.56 --> 7214.4800000000005
even realize it right i take all of that

7212.96 --> 7216.4
into account

7214.48 --> 7218.48
but yeah of course i question it's not

7216.4 --> 7220.96
just because somebody says it in my chat

7218.48 --> 7224.32
that automatically makes it true to me i

7220.96 --> 7227.599
have hope i've proven myself in in that

7224.32 --> 7230.32
in that sense if somebody's just saying

7227.599 --> 7234.400000000001
something that i got count information

7230.32 --> 7234.4
to the contrary i will freaking say it

7235.199 --> 7240.5599999999995
right but if yes somebody says that oh

7237.599 --> 7243.28
it's not just pepsi it's others

7240.56 --> 7244.56
i have no reason to think he made that

7243.28 --> 7246.639
up

7244.56 --> 7248.4800000000005
especially if he's gonna name specific

7246.639 --> 7250.719
rants and all that right

7248.48 --> 7254.199
i have no no reason to assume that he

7250.719 --> 7254.199
made that up

7259.76 --> 7264.88
use coke pepsi and coke to clean rust

7262.159 --> 7267.44
and grease well that's funny because

7264.88 --> 7269.92
that's what cola was originally used for

7267.44 --> 7273.598999999999
it was actually

7269.92 --> 7273.599
used in the car industry

7274.4 --> 7279.119
for

7275.36 --> 7280.839999999999
cleaning and greasing and stuff

7279.119 --> 7283.28
greasers

7280.84 --> 7285.4400000000005
cola yeah

7283.28 --> 7287.679
funny isn't it and then somebody's just

7285.44 --> 7290.32
figured like hey this kind of we kind of

7287.679 --> 7291.4400000000005
like the taste of this [ __ ]

7290.32 --> 7294.639
and then

7291.44 --> 7296.879999999999
some rubber baron ass

7294.639 --> 7298.96
or later became a rubber band thought

7296.88 --> 7301.599
like oh yeah let's just put some sugar

7298.96 --> 7303.36
and some cocaine in there

7301.599 --> 7305.119000000001
and we're just gonna make this into a

7303.36 --> 7306.719
trendy drink and then everybody in the

7305.119 --> 7308.639
world's gonna have it

7306.719 --> 7311.92
and in the future

7308.639 --> 7315.1990000000005
there will be a coca-cola

7311.92 --> 7317.599
drinking machine in every country

7315.199 --> 7320.32
including in the deserts

7317.599 --> 7323.28
so that even if you cannot find this

7320.32 --> 7326.32
spring of fresh water you will still be

7323.28 --> 7329.04
able to get a coca-cola

7326.32 --> 7329.04
yeah really

7333.679 --> 7337.4800000000005
that's basically it

7344.32 --> 7348.4
if you find contradictory information

7346.4 --> 7350.32
how do you discern which is the correct

7348.4 --> 7351.598999999999
or truthful information

7350.32 --> 7353.679
okay

7351.599 --> 7354.639
well let's start here

7353.679 --> 7357.599
first

7354.639 --> 7357.599
assume both

7358.48 --> 7360.718999999999
yeah

7359.84 --> 7363.04
because

7360.719 --> 7365.28
if you exclude something because you

7363.04 --> 7366.56
think it's wrong and you erase it from

7365.28 --> 7368.8
your memory

7366.56 --> 7370.8
you'll always fail

7368.8 --> 7374.320000000001
in the future

7370.8 --> 7376.400000000001
because everything that's wrong is right

7374.32 --> 7379.04
it's right in the sense

7376.4 --> 7382.48
that you know it's wrong and therefore

7379.04 --> 7382.48
it needs to be remembered

7382.96 --> 7387.28
so

7384.0 --> 7388.639
it's very simple cross reference

7387.28 --> 7390.88
everything

7388.639 --> 7393.84
and when i say everything i literally

7390.88 --> 7396.159000000001
mean everything

7393.84 --> 7398.2390000000005
you've ever heard about anything

7396.159 --> 7401.119
cross-reference it with everything

7398.239 --> 7403.04
you've heard about everything

7401.119 --> 7406.0
always do that

7403.04 --> 7407.599
and then eventually you'll just know

7406.0 --> 7410.4
that's what i do

7407.599 --> 7411.679
you just know like this

7410.4 --> 7413.04
is a dead end

7411.679 --> 7415.52
this

7413.04 --> 7417.5199999999995
has fractal implications that reach

7415.52 --> 7420.679
beyond my current understanding i know

7417.52 --> 7420.679
it's there

7428.56 --> 7434.2390000000005
what's with the weird talking voice

7431.84 --> 7437.04
that was me

7434.239 --> 7439.598999999999
i don't know

7437.04 --> 7442.56
getting kind of early 20th century

7439.599 --> 7442.56
american or something

7442.96 --> 7446.2390000000005
he had a business dream

7449.36 --> 7454.4
wasn't it like a whole thing

7451.599 --> 7456.639
from the from the coca-cola

7454.4 --> 7459.839999999999
inventor that he wanted

7456.639 --> 7461.84
coca-cola to be in every country in

7459.84 --> 7463.52
every desert that even if there wasn't

7461.84 --> 7465.92
fresh drinking water at least you could

7463.52 --> 7468.320000000001
get coca-cola that's literally was part

7465.92 --> 7468.32
of his

7468.56 --> 7471.92
objective

7471.119 --> 7475.44
so

7471.92 --> 7478.56
i really remember that part

7475.44 --> 7480.638999999999
and i kind of did the voice just to

7478.56 --> 7482.56
sort of

7480.639 --> 7487.28
get into that

7482.56 --> 7487.280000000001
dramatic megalomaniacal thinking

7487.599 --> 7490.599
right

7492.159 --> 7497.5199999999995
dude i do weird voices all the freaking

7494.639 --> 7500.400000000001
time like continually there's not a

7497.52 --> 7504.8
early bird show that passes by without

7500.4 --> 7506.96
me at least doing a weird voice once

7504.8 --> 7511.0
you know this is true i can't help

7506.96 --> 7511.0
myself i do it always

7541.599 --> 7544.599
hmm

7556.639 --> 7561.679
it was made to be a good cleaner after

7559.04 --> 7563.84
it was made as a drink

7561.679 --> 7563.84
no

7564.32 --> 7569.44
no i don't think so no

7566.639 --> 7571.84
no it was it was actually used as a

7569.44 --> 7571.839999999999
grease

7573.44 --> 7578.5599999999995
like

7575.04 --> 7581.28
not pouring coca-cola over stuff no it

7578.56 --> 7583.4400000000005
was used as a grease yes they later also

7581.28 --> 7584.96
figured out like oh if you put a nickel

7583.44 --> 7588.159
in there or

7584.96 --> 7590.88
it's gonna dissolve remember that yeah

7588.159 --> 7593.679
that has nothing to do with that was

7590.88 --> 7595.84
actually the the stuff

7593.679 --> 7598.96
the cola

7595.84 --> 7599.92
extract was used

7598.96 --> 7601.92
in

7599.92 --> 7604.159
motor industry

7601.92 --> 7605.36
as an oil it was just that's what they

7604.159 --> 7608.0
used

7605.36 --> 7609.598999999999
it's not that it was first a drink and

7608.0 --> 7613.92
then somebody spilled it over their

7609.599 --> 7617.88
mother like oh this corner works no no

7613.92 --> 7617.88
that's all afterwards [ __ ]

7619.92 --> 7624.32
more cleaning product from this

7622.639 --> 7626.88
that's crazy though that they did that

7624.32 --> 7626.88
afterward

7627.76 --> 7632.719
i would think the sugar in cola yeah

7630.639 --> 7635.04
they agreed

7632.719 --> 7636.4
right that's why i say they didn't use

7635.04 --> 7639.36
like

7636.4 --> 7640.239
dried up coca-cola

7639.36 --> 7641.679
no

7640.239 --> 7643.839999999999
cola not

7641.679 --> 7646.159
oil

7643.84 --> 7648.719
just the pure cola extract that's what

7646.159 --> 7651.44
they used in motor industry

7648.719 --> 7654.4
that's what i heard

7651.44 --> 7654.4
a long time ago

7654.8 --> 7657.84
and then

7655.84 --> 7660.0
somebody was like yeah we kind of like

7657.84 --> 7661.599
to tasted it we don't care if we got

7660.0 --> 7664.56
dirty hats

7661.599 --> 7667.04
right we like the taste and that's

7664.56 --> 7669.280000000001
when the guy came up with like oh maybe

7667.04 --> 7672.48
we could turn this into a drink

7669.28 --> 7672.48
it's not the other way around

7672.639 --> 7676.96
it's not like oh when we updated the car

7675.199 --> 7679.759999999999
industry because we figured out the

7676.96 --> 7682.0
coca-cola somebody dropped it into the

7679.76 --> 7685.8
engine and then it ran better no that's

7682.0 --> 7685.8
not how that happened

7689.84 --> 7693.4400000000005
you don't think this is correct

7696.159 --> 7701.239
originally made by pharmacist yeah but

7698.239 --> 7701.239
that's

7702.159 --> 7705.679
they added cola in there

7704.32 --> 7706.48
at first

7705.679 --> 7708.639
they'd

7706.48 --> 7710.5599999999995
uh

7708.639 --> 7713.599
now i'm really confused now i have to

7710.56 --> 7717.580000000001
look up like that very cola not what the

7713.599 --> 7720.7390000000005
history of that that literal fruit is

7717.58 --> 7720.739
[Applause]

7738.0 --> 7741.0
okay

7759.599 --> 7763.360000000001
that's interesting

7761.119 --> 7765.36
it's actually african

7763.36 --> 7769.0
so they didn't like found it in south

7765.36 --> 7769.0
america like potatoes

7772.8 --> 7777.119000000001
i don't think i've ever actually looked

7774.639 --> 7777.119
this up

7777.199 --> 7780.5199999999995
in the 1880s

7780.56 --> 7787.2390000000005
17th century

7783.52 --> 7787.2390000000005
88 instagram

7793.599 --> 7799.04
the cola recipe no longer contained

7795.84 --> 7801.679
actual cola nut extract

7799.04 --> 7804.079
since 2016.

7801.679 --> 7804.079
all right

7807.119 --> 7813.04
okay so there's like cola not in turkey

7809.84 --> 7815.84
too that's weird in nigeria

7813.04 --> 7815.84
and turkey

7816.079 --> 7819.28
right

7817.28 --> 7822.239
so yeah it seems that my story might

7819.28 --> 7822.239
have been incorrect

7825.199 --> 7830.159
because it was apparently being consumed

7828.56 --> 7833.119000000001
even before

7830.159 --> 7833.119
industrial age

7840.719 --> 7845.44
hmm

7843.04 --> 7845.44
all right

7846.719 --> 7852.079
well that there goes that idea

7850.0 --> 7854.48
i really thought that it was being used

7852.079 --> 7856.48
like industrial grease

7854.48 --> 7858.959999999999
this is yeah

7856.48 --> 7862.879999999999
but i guess

7858.96 --> 7862.88
somebody made that up and i believed it

7864.239 --> 7868.28
it was around before engines

7870.079 --> 7873.079
right

7902.88 --> 7907.1990000000005
maybe the controllers have changed the

7904.56 --> 7910.56
story about qualitative truth well in

7907.199 --> 7912.48
retrospect steamy traveler i think that

7910.56 --> 7916.400000000001
the story that i

7912.48 --> 7918.718999999999
collected somehow throughout my life

7916.4 --> 7921.199
it could be that that was actually made

7918.719 --> 7924.4
up by coca-cola to make

7921.199 --> 7927.678999999999
cola more legendary

7924.4 --> 7930.4
right it's an industrial

7927.679 --> 7932.8
good for cars right that's kind of manly

7930.4 --> 7936.159
and all that so it might have been made

7932.8 --> 7937.76
up by somebody

7936.159 --> 7941.119
to actually make

7937.76 --> 7943.52
coca-cola even cooler

7941.119 --> 7946.5199999999995
so i might be sort of mandela affected

7943.52 --> 7946.52
here

7966.159 --> 7969.839999999999
yeah let's not talk about that

7985.599 --> 7989.1990000000005
this uh yeah steven hi did the truth no

7988.239 --> 7991.919999999999
no no

7989.199 --> 7992.799999999999
no coca-cola and all that has never

7991.92 --> 7995.36
hid

7992.8 --> 7998.079000000001
the truth about the original medicines

7995.36 --> 8000.4
and all that where there was cocaine or

7998.079 --> 8003.119
coca leaf extract in there and all that

8000.4 --> 8006.48
no they never hit that that's like in

8003.119 --> 8009.48
their recorded history right

8006.48 --> 8009.48
now

8011.199 --> 8014.638999999999
i knew that drink was there for a long

8012.96 --> 8016.4800000000005
time i just

8014.639 --> 8018.079
thought like oh

8016.48 --> 8021.919999999999
it was

8018.079 --> 8024.32
became a popular drink because of

8021.92 --> 8026.88
its grease applications i thought there

8024.32 --> 8028.88
was like a cola nut

8026.88 --> 8032.96
grease

8028.88 --> 8032.96
that was really good for something

8033.44 --> 8038.4
but yeah i don't know i don't know if

8036.4 --> 8040.0
that's true it could literally have been

8038.4 --> 8041.28
completely made up

8040.0 --> 8046.0
i mean

8041.28 --> 8047.04
in retrospect why would you get some

8046.0 --> 8050.239
nut

8047.04 --> 8051.199
x oil extracted when you could just use

8050.239 --> 8054.32
like

8051.199 --> 8055.5199999999995
regular petrol petroleum and all that

8054.32 --> 8058.079
right

8055.52 --> 8059.92
which there was abundant of in the car

8058.079 --> 8061.679
age and all that so yeah

8059.92 --> 8063.599
it really was thinking about it more

8061.679 --> 8064.719
carefully it really doesn't make a lot

8063.599 --> 8066.639
of sense

8064.719 --> 8071.599
it might have been a tall tale made up

8066.639 --> 8071.599
to kind of make coca-cola seem more cool

8074.719 --> 8078.639
i don't know

8076.4 --> 8081.92
do they even say that do they claim that

8078.639 --> 8084.88
in their history that it's been used as

8081.92 --> 8084.88
mechanic grease

8095.52 --> 8100.280000000001
young is 27 hmm

8130.48 --> 8135.159
right

8132.159 --> 8135.159
anyway

8136.96 --> 8140.4800000000005
degrees are not for grease

8147.44 --> 8150.44
okay

8151.36 --> 8158.239
but was cola nut extract used for

8155.28 --> 8158.239
decreaser then

8161.119 --> 8165.44
i mean did i get it right or didn't i

8163.04 --> 8168.56
get it right i'm really confused now now

8165.44 --> 8169.919999999999
you're just swinging it around again

8168.56 --> 8173.360000000001
so

8169.92 --> 8174.8
was i correct about that story or wasn't

8173.36 --> 8177.5199999999995
i

8174.8 --> 8179.76
was it used industrially

8177.52 --> 8181.52
or wasn't it

8179.76 --> 8184.639
is that made up

8181.52 --> 8186.4800000000005
or was it actually used industrially now

8184.639 --> 8189.04
i i'm really i'm kind of sick of this

8186.48 --> 8189.04
subject

8190.239 --> 8194.16
removes grease

8193.2 --> 8196.319000000001
when

8194.16 --> 8197.599
when did they use that did they use that

8196.319 --> 8200.0
before

8197.599 --> 8205.719000000001
it became a popular drink

8200.0 --> 8205.719
or after it became a popular drink

8216.639 --> 8222.319
can i do one for what

8220.319 --> 8223.119999999999
yeah you might have to paypal me though

8222.319 --> 8226.119999999999
then

8223.12 --> 8226.12
yeah

8234.16 --> 8239.679
home remedy for decreasing

8236.399 --> 8244.399
but did they use cola nut extract

8239.679 --> 8244.399
or did they just use the drinks

8247.359 --> 8250.880000000001
after it became a god

8256.559 --> 8258.88
okay

8261.2 --> 8266.399000000001
fine

8263.76 --> 8267.84
okay i got it mixed up then and i'm

8266.399 --> 8270.08
going to now

8267.84 --> 8273.92
etch that [ __ ]

8270.08 --> 8276.88
with fire and acid in my head so that i

8273.92 --> 8280.399
never get that wrong again i don't want

8276.88 --> 8280.399
to ever get that wrong again

8287.12 --> 8289.439
right

8289.519 --> 8294.559000000001
so all that

8291.12 --> 8296.719000000001
dark world devil [ __ ] conjured

8294.559 --> 8300.319
nonsense that i filled in there between

8296.719 --> 8302.399
is now going to be destroyed forever

8300.319 --> 8306.399
i will never

8302.399 --> 8308.399
allow my mind to think that again

8306.399 --> 8311.84
because it was wrong and i don't want to

8308.399 --> 8311.84
remember things that are wrong

8312.399 --> 8316.119999999999
provably wrong

8318.399 --> 8323.439
because i'm not a baller that just goes

8320.96 --> 8327.039999999999
on a reset and just then make all the

8323.439 --> 8327.04
same mistakes over and over again

8327.599 --> 8330.960000000001
and tear it is twinning i'm not the

8329.04 --> 8334.639000000001
youngest

8330.96 --> 8334.639
you didn't know yet terry is a

8335.2 --> 8339.439
it's a young indian fellow

8343.28 --> 8347.84
let's talk about beer instead no

8375.519 --> 8377.84
hmm

8379.679 --> 8382.8
splattered baby

8384.399 --> 8388.399
we're all flat earth babies that's how

8386.719 --> 8392.519999999999
we all start

8388.399 --> 8392.519999999999
babies on a flat earth

8414.16 --> 8421.88
i make shows and use it absolutely not

8418.88 --> 8421.88
now

8440.319 --> 8444.92
flat for eight years huh

8445.2 --> 8449.08
that's quite a long time

8492.399 --> 8498.64
yeah five years is a long time

8495.68 --> 8500.880000000001
to get into flat earth

8498.64 --> 8504.16
it's enough time to get inside

8500.88 --> 8507.679999999998
a good proper size up of

8504.16 --> 8509.84
the psychological landscape

8507.68 --> 8513.52
right because in the end that's

8509.84 --> 8513.52
that's really the the biggest

8513.84 --> 8518.0
learning ground

8515.92 --> 8520.72
it's it's the brig the biggest place

8518.0 --> 8522.88
where you can grow is psychological

8520.72 --> 8524.88
right because the mechanics yes there's

8522.88 --> 8526.72
a lot of it

8524.88 --> 8529.199999999999
but the mechanics aren't the problem

8526.72 --> 8531.76
it's the psychology that actually forms

8529.2 --> 8531.76
the problem

8531.84 --> 8536.56
the psychology of willing ignorance and

8534.56 --> 8539.6
scatter gunning and gaslighting and

8536.56 --> 8540.64
straw manning and ad homing

8539.6 --> 8542.479000000001
that's

8540.64 --> 8543.68
the major

8542.479 --> 8546.0
task

8543.68 --> 8547.76
at hand every time

8546.0 --> 8549.68
it's not the mechanics

8547.76 --> 8551.359
because the mechanics are being ignored

8549.68 --> 8552.800000000001
whether you are able to figure it out or

8551.359 --> 8555.12
not

8552.8 --> 8557.84
why no fed i don't know rest ahead hello

8555.12 --> 8557.84
by the way

8558.24 --> 8562.96
nathan might have like a hospital day or

8560.56 --> 8562.96
something

8563.28 --> 8567.800000000001
i mean he has broken ribs

8591.68 --> 8594.800000000001
what the [ __ ] you didn't know

8595.6 --> 8598.56
i don't know if he's like publicly said

8597.439 --> 8600.64
it already

8598.56 --> 8603.68
on the live show but yeah

8600.64 --> 8606.319
when he had the carpet incident

8603.68 --> 8608.880000000001
with the jab in his face and all that

8606.319 --> 8612.84
he apparently also broke ribs and he

8608.88 --> 8612.839999999998
hadn't even noticed that

8613.76 --> 8617.68
but he found out recently

8621.68 --> 8627.439
could be it could be something else

8625.28 --> 8631.04
huh broken ribs yeah

8627.439 --> 8631.04
yeah broken ribs yeah

8631.68 --> 8637.04
i mean he passed out

8634.08 --> 8640.0
unexpectedly slammed into the ground

8637.04 --> 8643.04
like onto a knife in his face right when

8640.0 --> 8646.64
you slam onto the ground during fainting

8643.04 --> 8646.640000000001
yeah you can break your ribs

8648.479 --> 8652.679999999998
that's a distinct possibility

8656.64 --> 8661.519999999999
so he's been walking around with that

8658.64 --> 8661.519999999999
for weeks

8662.24 --> 8667.119999999999
i'm pretty surprised he's even been able

8664.72 --> 8667.119999999999
to do

8667.2 --> 8671.92
well his

8669.04 --> 8674.160000000002
his crackdown on ballers on his show on

8671.92 --> 8677.92
that energy level with freaking broken

8674.16 --> 8679.359
ribs that's pretty astounding

8677.92 --> 8682.359
so

8679.359 --> 8682.359
yeah

8683.52 --> 8688.16
of course he does kind of

8685.52 --> 8690.24
naturally want it want that to heal up

8688.16 --> 8692.08
properly so

8690.24 --> 8693.6
i don't know still i don't know if

8692.08 --> 8695.68
that's why he's not doing a show it

8693.6 --> 8698.479000000001
could be that there's a family's thing

8695.68 --> 8698.479000000001
or whatever

8699.52 --> 8702.640000000001
why did he faint no

8703.12 --> 8709.04
he explained this it's probably a blood

8705.68 --> 8711.52
circulation issue when you're carpeting

8709.04 --> 8713.68
you're constantly crouched

8711.52 --> 8715.68
and if you then over

8713.68 --> 8716.720000000001
exhaust yourself

8715.68 --> 8719.04
yeah

8716.72 --> 8721.438999999998
it's it's actually widely known that

8719.04 --> 8722.960000000001
carpenters especially when they don't do

8721.439 --> 8725.52
it professionally

8722.96 --> 8728.319
that when you do your own carpet a lot

8725.52 --> 8732.960000000001
of people accidentally faint

8728.319 --> 8732.96
it's a widely known thing apparently

8734.72 --> 8738.64
professionals don't have the issue

8736.479 --> 8741.76
because they're used to it they know how

8738.64 --> 8742.64
to handle their blood flow to prevent

8741.76 --> 8744.880000000001
that

8742.64 --> 8747.439
if you not professional and you think oh

8744.88 --> 8752.119999999999
i'll just do that in my own home yeah

8747.439 --> 8752.12
then you risk that happening

8753.6 --> 8758.960000000001
also i might have something to do with

8755.28 --> 8760.479000000001
the fumes of a new carpet right or the

8758.96 --> 8764.08
dust

8760.479 --> 8767.64
garbage underneath the old

8764.08 --> 8767.64
all kinds of influences

8768.8 --> 8774.0
is that why nathan couldn't shave yeah

8770.96 --> 8776.72
he let his beard grow because

8774.0 --> 8776.72
it was all

8777.2 --> 8781.68
scabby and

8779.28 --> 8784.880000000001
he couldn't shave it

8781.68 --> 8784.880000000001
he would have opened the wound

8787.04 --> 8790.560000000001
right but that's healed up since then

8788.88 --> 8792.16
fine so

8790.56 --> 8795.16
but he still has the broken ribs

8792.16 --> 8795.16
apparently

8811.439 --> 8815.16
okay matthew hall

8836.08 --> 8842.08
daughter having fitzy yeah or could have

8838.64 --> 8842.08
contributed to it sure

8842.56 --> 8847.279999999999
yeah poor nathan fell down go boom boom

8844.8 --> 8847.279999999999
indeed

8848.399 --> 8854.72
yeah because he's he's actually denser

8851.439 --> 8854.720000000001
than the medium he was in

8854.8 --> 8859.519999999999
i mean if he was just gas it would have

8857.439 --> 8861.92
never happened he would have just spread

8859.52 --> 8864.560000000001
around in all directions

8861.92 --> 8868.479
but he isn't gas so yeah he did

8864.56 --> 8868.479
absolutely go down go boom boom

8873.92 --> 8876.92
whoa

8879.12 --> 8884.240000000002
okay you rasta

8882.16 --> 8886.56
yeah you're busy

8884.24 --> 8889.96
all right good i guess

8886.56 --> 8889.96
take it easy

8907.76 --> 8912.800000000001
also enough yeah he didn't get any

8909.92 --> 8912.8
george centric

8915.76 --> 8920.12
i mean he's not insane

8923.359 --> 8929.52
i mean if seriously if you have like oh

8926.8 --> 8932.0
i'm fainting from the jab

8929.52 --> 8935.68
really well if it really is that or

8932.0 --> 8937.439
guess what usually that [ __ ]

8935.68 --> 8940.24
that caused that

8937.439 --> 8941.28
doesn't really go away

8940.24 --> 8942.319
yeah

8941.28 --> 8944.479000000001
once

8942.319 --> 8946.96
jabs

8944.479 --> 8949.199999999999
like really hit your system to the point

8946.96 --> 8952.56
where you faint from it

8949.2 --> 8955.6
usually normal steady going life after

8952.56 --> 8958.16
that point is finished

8955.6 --> 8961.28
yeah so that didn't happen because

8958.16 --> 8963.039999999999
nathan is still just going about

8961.28 --> 8965.12
he's doing fine even with freaking

8963.04 --> 8966.080000000002
broken ribs so it's not

8965.12 --> 8967.359
jab

8966.08 --> 8968.96
okay

8967.359 --> 8971.92
is that clear

8968.96 --> 8971.919999999998
george sanford

8972.16 --> 8975.319
all right

8980.24 --> 8986.76
no he didn't appeal

8982.479 --> 8986.76
george just blabbering again

8992.8 --> 8996.88
all right anyway i think i'm gonna round

8994.399 --> 8996.88
out the show

8999.92 --> 9003.2
nathan does have a lot of hot air when

9001.68 --> 9006.56
he scores

9003.2 --> 9006.560000000001
are we not happy

9008.0 --> 9012.72
yeah

9010.319 --> 9014.399
well i do have a tendency to kind of be

9012.72 --> 9017.039999999999
like a needle

9014.399 --> 9019.519999999999
in the face of a balloon

9017.04 --> 9022.560000000001
of balloons i do

9019.52 --> 9025.52
just naturally have that tendency

9022.56 --> 9028.64
so i don't mind if nathan blows up

9025.52 --> 9032.439
because i can be kind of disruptive in

9028.64 --> 9032.439
people's flow sometimes

9033.92 --> 9037.2
right

9034.72 --> 9038.16
but hey if i was actually right with my

9037.2 --> 9040.560000000001
quick

9038.16 --> 9043.359
rumpassing insert or something yeah he

9040.56 --> 9047.279999999999
can scold me all he likes afterward

9043.359 --> 9049.439
he will realize that i was right

9047.28 --> 9053.16
when i'm right i'm right

9049.439 --> 9053.16
when i'm right and right

9070.16 --> 9074.359
i like cheese okay

9080.319 --> 9084.56
right anyway

9082.08 --> 9087.6
thanks everyone for coming

9084.56 --> 9088.399
this extra long show because nathan's

9087.6 --> 9090.479000000001
not

9088.399 --> 9092.399
having a live show today

9090.479 --> 9095.679999999998
love it when i would put nathan in

9092.399 --> 9095.68
timeout and early yes

9096.24 --> 9100.84
but only when he's just squirting

9098.24 --> 9104.64
overkill or

9100.84 --> 9106.880000000001
yeah but i mean like nathan really gets

9104.64 --> 9108.56
going when there's like triggered

9106.88 --> 9109.839999999998
fundies

9108.56 --> 9112.08
you know

9109.84 --> 9114.319
triggered fun is in denial like really

9112.08 --> 9118.24
as nathan says it honestly it makes his

9114.319 --> 9119.119999999999
blood boil and then he goes into like

9118.24 --> 9121.6
yeah

9119.12 --> 9123.76
bulldog mode basically taking a bite not

9121.6 --> 9124.960000000001
letting go and keep shaking until it

9123.76 --> 9127.04
dies

9124.96 --> 9129.519999999999
that's what nathan does and he kind of

9127.04 --> 9132.160000000002
gets blinded right you can't get a

9129.52 --> 9134.479000000001
bulldog to let go once they've bitten

9132.16 --> 9137.039999999999
that's usually a huge problem you

9134.479 --> 9139.119999999999
literally have to break open their jaw

9137.04 --> 9140.960000000001
to make them stop nathan has a bit of

9139.12 --> 9142.880000000001
that tendency

9140.96 --> 9144.64
so yeah i did have to time him out one

9142.88 --> 9147.679999999998
time when he was just like kind of

9144.64 --> 9147.68
snowing my chat

9149.92 --> 9154.24
and i will do that i can do that and he

9152.64 --> 9156.84
doesn't mind

9154.24 --> 9159.439
like he doesn't really care because he's

9156.84 --> 9161.52
just in that moment and then yeah if you

9159.439 --> 9162.800000000001
have to kick the dog to make him stop

9161.52 --> 9163.92
right

9162.8 --> 9167.358999999999
then

9163.92 --> 9167.359
yeah that's the way it is

9171.04 --> 9173.84
anyway
