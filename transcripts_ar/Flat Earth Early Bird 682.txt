5.6 --> 35.95
[Music]

48.879 --> 53.32
good morning

50.879 --> 54.559
welcome to flat earth early bird number

53.32 --> 56.8
682

54.559 --> 58.64
i'm your host arwyn and before we start

56.8 --> 60.959999999999994
the show please don't forget to share it

58.64 --> 62.8
on any platform you deem fit and if you

60.96 --> 64.32000000000001
haven't already subscribe to my channel

62.8 --> 65.75999999999999
and hit the bell notification so you

64.32 --> 67.91999999999999
know when i'm going live

65.76 --> 69.43900000000001
which is normally 2 p.m amsterdam time

67.92 --> 71.43900000000001
every day and please

69.439 --> 73.27999999999999
also do support me through the paypal

71.439 --> 74.88
patreon the super chat and membership

73.28 --> 79.28
system join button

74.88 --> 82.479
that'd be much appreciated so

79.28 --> 86.0
yeah today the weather is just uh

82.479 --> 87.759
dreary it just now

86.0 --> 91.2
only stopped raining it's been raining

87.759 --> 91.2
pretty much entire morning

91.6 --> 98.479
and uh not so windy

94.72 --> 98.479
although it's not wind still either

98.64 --> 104.609
yeah i haven't gone outside yet

101.53 --> 104.609
[Music]

105.36 --> 110.88
anyway got green tea

112.32 --> 115.83999999999999
let's see who's in chat so far

117.04 --> 121.759
good servant who's first obermical

119.92 --> 125.43900000000001
stopping trafficking arrest the hat

121.759 --> 128.72
hannah koala obermoco tom parker

125.439 --> 131.35999999999999
agm well

128.72 --> 131.35999999999999
welcomes

133.12 --> 137.04
wow you all roll in very quickly

140.879 --> 143.84
yeah good to see you

157.28 --> 163.2
let's see i did make some notes but not

160.4 --> 170.56
too elaborately yeah i thought so

163.2 --> 173.2
should have made some more notes

170.56 --> 175.84
um right yeah flatters the [ __ ]

173.2 --> 177.92
yesterday was pretty good

175.84 --> 179.68
and owen benjamin was life and that was

177.92 --> 182.48
also awesome

179.68 --> 184.72
a lot of music it was good you know i

182.48 --> 188.159
like it when he does his music

184.72 --> 192.239
every now and then you know it just

188.159 --> 192.239
helps cool things down a little

193.68 --> 199.84
yeah yeah and after that

200.72 --> 203.68
i would have been doing

205.04 --> 213.84
watching movies i think or at least

207.76 --> 213.84
checking it out

217.76 --> 224.319
all right what it's tuesday yeah i think

221.92 --> 226.0
what i think ball buster should have had

224.319 --> 231.2
it premiere

226.0 --> 231.2
but i completely missed out on that

231.519 --> 234.159
it's weird

237.04 --> 240.07999999999998
hmm isn't there a way to have like a

239.68 --> 243.36
bigger

240.08 --> 243.36
list of notifications

247.599 --> 251.2
because i don't see a lot in the list

249.76 --> 252.879
that i can watch back

251.2 --> 255.599
in the corner of the youtube screen if

252.879 --> 259.03999999999996
you know what i mean

255.599 --> 269.84
oh well and that's why it's useful to

259.04 --> 269.84000000000003
make notes

274.88 --> 278.04
but uh yeah anyway i've watched movies

277.6 --> 282.47900000000004
watch

278.04 --> 285.36
2012 again it's been a long time

282.479 --> 287.919
it's just a giant destruction orgy

285.36 --> 287.91900000000004
basically

288.08 --> 292.4
but still it's interesting to look back

291.6 --> 295.68
at it

292.4 --> 297.84
especially because at the time i kind of

295.68 --> 301.68
believed that

297.84 --> 304.0
i was really tense up until 2012

301.68 --> 306.8
well that day yeah like i literally

304.0 --> 309.28
remember just waiting

306.8 --> 310.56
so it was weird to to watch that back

309.28 --> 312.32
and now look at it from a new

310.56 --> 314.08
perspective

312.32 --> 316.4
since everything we've learned i've

314.08 --> 316.4
learned

319.12 --> 324.479
also notice how predominant the

321.8 --> 328.88
geologists are in that movie

324.479 --> 328.88
like they are the ultimate scientists

329.039 --> 336.15999999999997
geologists everywhere like even on the

332.72 --> 338.47900000000004
on the secret plane president there was

336.16 --> 340.40000000000003
just geologists there

338.479 --> 342.479
with their prediction models and

340.4 --> 345.19899999999996
everything is it's yeah

342.479 --> 346.4
it's kind of funny when you think about

345.199 --> 350.84000000000003
it carefully

346.4 --> 353.84
like but the movie yeah it's pretty

350.84 --> 353.84
smooth

358.24 --> 367.84000000000003
uh anyway

362.479 --> 367.84
hey roger

370.72 --> 374.16
oh wait yeah you're ready there

376.88 --> 384.0
anyway yeah i'm pretty much open

380.639 --> 384.0
for talk questions

384.88 --> 390.15999999999997
that's nothing really that i'm dwelling

388.0 --> 390.16
on

391.28 --> 394.4
though yeah i wanted to make note of

393.68 --> 397.12
that i

394.4 --> 397.919
find my skills with clovers much better

397.12 --> 401.36
now

397.919 --> 403.84
because i got some pretty yeah well

401.36 --> 406.0
devout globers hang around in my chat

403.84 --> 408.79999999999995
sometimes and i think i

406.0 --> 409.28
i really know how to deal with them when

408.8 --> 412.40000000000003
say

409.28 --> 415.19899999999996
a year ago i would get just

412.4 --> 417.44
really annoyed or just immediately ban

415.199 --> 417.44
them

417.84 --> 423.84
and now yeah that bar has been

421.199 --> 423.84000000000003
raised

424.4 --> 427.52
so that it requires like a specific type

426.639 --> 429.759
of frequency

427.52 --> 432.08
and behavior that comes from it in order

429.759 --> 434.40000000000003
for me to do that

432.08 --> 435.599
because it at the same time because it

434.4 --> 438.96
is flat earth it's

435.599 --> 442.319
good to feel

438.96 --> 444.88
part of the reason why we're doing it

442.319 --> 446.72
like why do this because of all that

444.88 --> 447.44
conditioning out there that needs to be

446.72 --> 450.56
overcome

447.44 --> 454.24
because it is so tough it's like one of

450.56 --> 457.28000000000003
the toughest lessons a person can learn

454.24 --> 460.8
and to have globers in chat

457.28 --> 464.4
showing that how they respond to

460.8 --> 467.12
in their face arguments and logic that's

464.4 --> 468.56
part of the learning journey and i think

467.12 --> 471.28000000000003
it's worth

468.56 --> 474.639
showing some of that it's not worth like

471.28 --> 476.31899999999996
constantly having a loop on that

474.639 --> 479.599
and make it all about the globers in

476.319 --> 482.319
their minds

479.599 --> 483.919
but it is good to involve it every now

482.319 --> 487.36
and then

483.919 --> 489.919
to remind us why it is kind of necessary

487.36 --> 489.91900000000004
to do this

490.319 --> 494.879
you know because if people didn't have

492.4 --> 498.15999999999997
all these obstacles

494.879 --> 500.639
then we wouldn't get trolled so much

498.16 --> 503.199
and we wouldn't be such a hot iron

500.639 --> 503.199
subject

504.16 --> 506.96000000000004
iron fe effie

512.8 --> 515.8389999999999
ah speaking of the devil look who's in

515.44 --> 521.839
chat

515.839 --> 521.839
hello mr jones

523.2 --> 526.8000000000001
well look mr jones

527.2 --> 536.5600000000001
for people that are in your position

531.36 --> 540.8000000000001
it is impossible to prove something

536.56 --> 540.8
to the level of undeniability

541.2 --> 546.88
because it's been proven that if

544.24 --> 548.8
push comes to shove as they say i'm

546.88 --> 551.92
correct

548.8 --> 554.56
the globers will get to the point

551.92 --> 555.68
where they will just deny things like

554.56 --> 558.0799999999999
natural law

555.68 --> 561.279
which are like the yeah the ground up

558.08 --> 561.279
foundations for

561.36 --> 565.519
just conventions of sensibility

567.12 --> 574.64
so yeah that's

571.2 --> 575.2
why we haven't been able to undeniably

574.64 --> 577.6
prove

575.2 --> 581.12
the earth is flat because you will

577.6 --> 581.12
always be able to deny it

582.88 --> 585.92
that's that's your prerogative that's

585.04 --> 589.519
free

585.92 --> 591.68
that's free choice god made it that way

589.519 --> 592.16
he designed the realm that way in order

591.68 --> 595.279
to

592.16 --> 598.56
allow people to switch onto

595.279 --> 605.12
a mistake and yeah if that sticks it's

598.56 --> 608.0
now it's their problem

605.12 --> 608.64
no now the evidence is blatant the

608.0 --> 611.839
evidence

608.64 --> 614.64
is natural law is on our side

611.839 --> 614.6400000000001
mr jones

616.399 --> 621.839
the very forces of nature back our

619.2 --> 621.839
arguments

623.04 --> 633.8389999999999
it's very little you can do about it

625.36 --> 633.839
except deny

637.12 --> 644.64
it proves it's flat or rather it is

640.72 --> 645.6800000000001
counter opposite to a ileocentric

644.64 --> 649.92
cosmology

645.68 --> 653.76
that's what it proves natural law

649.92 --> 656.959
proves it's impossible we live live in

653.76 --> 660.3199999999999
a literal heliocentric model

656.959 --> 662.2399999999999
as presumed that's against natural law

660.32 --> 665.6
in many ways

662.24 --> 667.839
primarily entropy law concerning gas gas

665.6 --> 670.9590000000001
pressure

667.839 --> 672.72
that's one of the laws right now however

670.959 --> 676.0
that works in a

672.72 --> 678.1600000000001
flat earth conception

676.0 --> 679.6
well we don't exactly know but there are

678.16 --> 682.7199999999999
certain conditions

679.6 --> 684.8000000000001
that must be there

682.72 --> 689.839
because of natural law and that is for

684.8 --> 689.8389999999999
starters containment

692.0 --> 697.2
there cannot be unlimited amount of

694.0 --> 699.12
space in a vacuum

697.2 --> 703.519
you know there's all kinds of options

699.12 --> 705.76
still left but it's not that

703.519 --> 707.92
because it breaks natural law you can't

705.76 --> 717.8389999999999
argue against it

707.92 --> 717.8389999999999
you can only deny it

743.76 --> 749.519
entropy law entropy law gas pressure

747.2 --> 752.48
expansion

749.519 --> 753.2
in all directions to fill the available

752.48 --> 758.24
space

753.2 --> 761.6
within the available container

758.24 --> 763.6
that that effect that natural

761.6 --> 765.36
natural law official it's part of

763.6 --> 768.72
entropy it's not the only

765.36 --> 770.8000000000001
way entropy expresses itself materially

768.72 --> 773.279
but that is one way it does it

770.8 --> 774.639
officially registered and classified

773.279 --> 776.32
under natural law

774.639 --> 779.519
well that doesn't work out in

776.32 --> 779.519
heliocentric model

781.92 --> 785.68
atmospheric pressure is just it's a

784.079 --> 789.04
lawyer game it's literally

785.68 --> 792.4799999999999
moving words it doesn't change

789.04 --> 792.48
the natural mechanics

793.76 --> 798.8
a renaming game is not gonna make your

796.399 --> 801.839
heliocentric model work

798.8 --> 801.8389999999999
mr jones

811.28 --> 814.51
[Music]

815.2 --> 819.519
yeah he just wants to say ball earth

817.76 --> 822.8
pressure he just wants to say it

819.519 --> 825.36
you know he's basically red herring

822.8 --> 827.04
my argument it breaks natural law gas

825.36 --> 830.32
pressure expansion

827.04 --> 831.4399999999999
then focuses instead on the word gas

830.32 --> 834.88
pressure

831.44 --> 837.12
and then wants to give his baller

834.88 --> 838.079
version of that word in order to

837.12 --> 840.72
distract that

838.079 --> 842.3199999999999
it doesn't really matter just move on to

840.72 --> 845.76
the next subject

842.32 --> 848.1600000000001
because there is no counter argument

845.76 --> 849.36
that will make him look good when

848.16 --> 851.519
addressing

849.36 --> 853.839
that the heliocentric model does not

851.519 --> 856.32
abide to natural law

853.839 --> 857.519
concerning gas pressure expansion or

856.32 --> 860.0
atmospheric

857.519 --> 862.0
pressure expansion if you will doesn't

860.0 --> 863.12
really matter

862.0 --> 865.6
doesn't really matter how you

863.12 --> 866.639
conceptualize it if you conceptualize

865.6 --> 869.76
the earth as a ball

866.639 --> 871.6
with those type of parameters

869.76 --> 874.0
it's still going to break natural law

871.6 --> 877.12
and then just blow off

874.0 --> 880.48
nearly instantly because

877.12 --> 883.199
it's an open system by admission it's an

880.48 --> 884.0790000000001
open system there's no barrier to

883.199 --> 885.92
prevent the gas

884.079 --> 889.92
pressure from expanding in all

885.92 --> 889.92
directions to fill the available space

890.959 --> 896.8389999999999
no not scientific law that's

894.0 --> 900.16
no natural law i'm being very specific

896.839 --> 900.1600000000001
natural law

902.24 --> 905.6800000000001
not scientific law

907.519 --> 911.04
but gravity yeah gravity isn't like even

910.32 --> 913.44
if you

911.04 --> 915.4399999999999
imagine that gravity is a force which

913.44 --> 917.0400000000001
officially it's not but you can think of

915.44 --> 919.6800000000001
it apparently

917.04 --> 920.24
as such or if you think of it as a force

919.68 --> 922.6389999999999
it's

920.24 --> 924.5600000000001
then classified under a weak force while

922.639 --> 927.6800000000001
that weak force cannot

924.56 --> 930.3199999999999
hold up it can only

927.68 --> 932.16
push back very slightly it doesn't have

930.32 --> 936.0790000000001
the required

932.16 --> 938.56
type of ability

936.079 --> 939.8389999999999
to form a container and prevent gas

938.56 --> 941.92
pressure from expanding in all

939.839 --> 944.1600000000001
directions

941.92 --> 946.0
because it's a weak force and yeah the

944.16 --> 948.7199999999999
container is supposedly

946.0 --> 952.0
infinite size which means that the gas

948.72 --> 954.48
pressure is going to pretty much expand

952.0 --> 955.6
by entropy with infinite strength there

954.48 --> 957.519
it will be nothing

955.6 --> 959.12
that will be able to prevent it from

957.519 --> 962.399
expanding

959.12 --> 965.92
because the container is infinite

962.399 --> 967.04
and that means that the force of the gas

965.92 --> 969.199
pressure expansion

967.04 --> 970.16
will therefore be infinite because it's

969.199 --> 973.519
directly

970.16 --> 974.639
related to the volume of the container

973.519 --> 977.68
which is infinite

974.639 --> 977.6800000000001
so you got a problem

980.8 --> 983.8389999999999
it doesn't matter whether you believe in

982.959 --> 987.7589999999999
gravity

983.839 --> 990.639
whether you want to drag that into the

987.759 --> 993.1990000000001
moral conception of heliocentric earth

990.639 --> 994.88
doesn't matter because even within that

993.199 --> 999.199
conception it can't

994.88 --> 999.199
do it it's impossible

1003.68 --> 1008.399
how can you have an indeed you're asking

1006.88 --> 1011.92
me mr jones

1008.399 --> 1015.199
that's your model it's the infinite

1011.92 --> 1018.959
outer space universe it's officially

1015.199 --> 1021.519
infinite it's only that when

1018.959 --> 1022.88
i don't know uh what do you call them

1021.519 --> 1025.6
astrologists

1022.88 --> 1027.52
astrophysicists want to calculate

1025.6 --> 1030.0
something about the presupposed

1027.52 --> 1030.6399999999999
outer space universe then they put a

1030.0 --> 1032.48
number

1030.64 --> 1033.919
if the volume is somehow involved they

1032.48 --> 1035.679
put a number to it

1033.919 --> 1037.76
it's only because otherwise they can't

1035.679 --> 1039.199
calculate it because they made a little

1037.76 --> 1042.079
problem for themselves by

1039.199 --> 1045.28
conceptualizing that the outer space

1042.079 --> 1046.6399999999999
universe volume is infinite oh you got a

1045.28 --> 1048.3999999999999
problem then because it doesn't work

1046.64 --> 1048.64
with the calculation so they just make

1048.4 --> 1051.2800000000002
an

1048.64 --> 1053.44
arbitrary super huge number to fill that

1051.28 --> 1056.08
in

1053.44 --> 1059.679
overlooking that they're technically by

1056.08 --> 1063.4399999999998
their own conceptions making an error

1059.679 --> 1066.96
because it's infinite yeah

1063.44 --> 1069.52
and now calculus wise they may be

1066.96 --> 1071.2
allowed to put a number to it because

1069.52 --> 1074.08
otherwise you can't calculate it

1071.2 --> 1074.4
but when you just mentally conceive of

1074.08 --> 1078.0
it

1074.4 --> 1080.5590000000002
verbally without resting on mathematics

1078.0 --> 1082.16
and mathematics rules little tricks you

1080.559 --> 1083.76
can do there

1082.16 --> 1087.1200000000001
if you don't rest on that you just

1083.76 --> 1089.84
conceive of it verbally mentally

1087.12 --> 1091.36
then that infinity can just be addressed

1089.84 --> 1093.9189999999999
and pointed out

1091.36 --> 1096.559
it breaks it breaks everything it breaks

1093.919 --> 1101.1200000000001
everything concerning gas laws

1096.559 --> 1101.12
everything so yeah

1106.64 --> 1114.3200000000002
no mr jones the globe

1110.48 --> 1118.64
model does it claim we have an infinite

1114.32 --> 1121.6789999999999
container in nowhere uh

1118.64 --> 1125.679
well it may not be saying it like that

1121.679 --> 1129.1200000000001
but it's definitely officially stated

1125.679 --> 1131.6000000000001
that the universe is supposedly infinite

1129.12 --> 1131.6
sized

1131.919 --> 1138.88
it's it's like it hasn't been altered

1135.44 --> 1140.64
you know people make or

1138.88 --> 1142.48
you say astrophysics i think some of

1140.64 --> 1145.5200000000002
them might be trying to

1142.48 --> 1147.84
size up how big that is

1145.52 --> 1149.28
to try to translate it but it's not

1147.84 --> 1154.0
official

1149.28 --> 1156.799
it's not like an official declaration

1154.0 --> 1158.96
like it is now this size and we can

1156.799 --> 1161.36
prove it is only this size and not

1158.96 --> 1164.799
bigger and it won't get bigger see

1161.36 --> 1166.3999999999999
because it is infinite size so any

1164.799 --> 1169.679
claims about its size are just

1166.4 --> 1171.52
up for grabs it's just it's no

1169.679 --> 1173.1200000000001
none of those claims are going to stick

1171.52 --> 1175.039
it's just going to stick until somebody

1173.12 --> 1180.08
makes an even bigger claim

1175.039 --> 1180.08
see because it's infinite sized

1181.039 --> 1185.039
oh well there you go the universe is an

1183.039 --> 1187.28
infinite system well guess what an

1185.039 --> 1193.039
infinite open system

1187.28 --> 1195.44
means infinite container

1193.039 --> 1196.16
that's mechanics that's the physics

1195.44 --> 1199.52
mechanics

1196.16 --> 1202.16
we're dealing with gas pressure and gas

1199.52 --> 1202.16
laws here

1203.52 --> 1208.72
how can it be infinite if it is also

1205.679 --> 1212.24
expanding well that's because

1208.72 --> 1214.48
the matter within this infinite universe

1212.24 --> 1216.159
is not infinite sized and it is

1214.48 --> 1218.32
supposedly expanding

1216.159 --> 1220.5590000000002
within the infinite volume of the

1218.32 --> 1223.9189999999999
container see

1220.559 --> 1227.12
that's the idea it's like an explosion

1223.919 --> 1234.64
that's never going to reach

1227.12 --> 1237.84
that's never going to stop like that

1234.64 --> 1240.88
it's neither open or closed just

1237.84 --> 1244.1589999999999
no oh everything is

1240.88 --> 1248.0800000000002
open system planets

1244.159 --> 1251.2800000000002
suppose it's suns they are resting

1248.08 --> 1255.28
in an open vacuum

1251.28 --> 1257.28
there's nothing to shield their supposed

1255.28 --> 1258.6399999999999
yeah atmospheres if they're supposed to

1257.28 --> 1262.0
have them

1258.64 --> 1265.2
from the outer space

1262.0 --> 1268.559
uh super vacuum that's also

1265.2 --> 1271.039
supposed to be out there so

1268.559 --> 1273.039
you seem to be having a bit of trouble

1271.039 --> 1274.8799999999999
figuring this out mr jones

1273.039 --> 1277.84
hello by the way adam meekin good to see

1274.88 --> 1277.8400000000001
you in chat

1288.84 --> 1296.08
uh what

1291.36 --> 1299.28
adam i don't think

1296.08 --> 1302.96
you can give a volume volume to

1299.28 --> 1305.84
time maybe in space time but

1302.96 --> 1306.88
i don't really get that's just fooling

1305.84 --> 1309.52
around with words

1306.88 --> 1309.5200000000002
adam meekin

1312.88 --> 1320.4
scientists would disagree really so

1317.039 --> 1324.4
what experimentation would they forward

1320.4 --> 1326.48
to disprove my assertions

1324.4 --> 1330.24
mr jones that weren't scientific by the

1326.48 --> 1330.24
way so it doesn't technically really

1330.84 --> 1333.84
matter

1337.6 --> 1340.799
can't see anyone else

1342.07 --> 1347.4399999999998
[Music]

1344.32 --> 1350.48
what that will just refresh the page

1347.44 --> 1350.48
then mr jones

1357.76 --> 1363.28
it's defining infinite well infinite is

1361.44 --> 1369.6000000000001
a concept

1363.28 --> 1371.9189999999999
it's like yeah one divided by zero

1369.6 --> 1373.039
or infinitely small zero divided by one

1371.919 --> 1375.919
it's conceptual

1373.039 --> 1377.52
it only exists within mathematical

1375.919 --> 1380.48
conception

1377.52 --> 1382.48
in physical reality there is no infinity

1380.48 --> 1384.799
it's a physical impossibility

1382.48 --> 1389.84
i'm stating this and i dare anyone to

1384.799 --> 1389.84
disprove me at it

1392.88 --> 1403.8400000000001
there's no infinity in physicality

1405.72 --> 1408.819
[Music]

1413.68 --> 1418.3490000000002
[Music]

1419.12 --> 1425.76
hmm a count aka eric helbert

1423.2 --> 1425.76
a balloon

1427.919 --> 1431.919
the new kind of church one

1430.33 --> 1434.96
[Music]

1431.919 --> 1437.2
the yeah maybe this

1434.96 --> 1441.039
they certainly seem to have created the

1437.2 --> 1443.64
supposed scientific revolution

1441.039 --> 1446.1589999999999
i think we could safely state that

1443.64 --> 1448.64
heliocentrism is the catholic church's

1446.159 --> 1448.64
project

1452.159 --> 1456.8400000000001
or at least but maybe not their brain

1454.88 --> 1461.2
trust project but they are the

1456.84 --> 1461.1999999999998
executioners of the plan i think

1462.32 --> 1467.52
which just goes to show that they are

1465.279 --> 1467.52
well

1468.4 --> 1472.5590000000002
kind of by christ's word they are the

1470.88 --> 1475.44
the devil

1472.559 --> 1476.24
sort of the antichrist system or because

1475.44 --> 1478.3200000000002
yeah

1476.24 --> 1480.72
how did they start out by taking over

1478.32 --> 1486.08
the christ religion

1480.72 --> 1488.559
and then exit terrorizing it to all [ __ ]

1486.08 --> 1491.4399999999998
turning like yeah turning it into

1488.559 --> 1491.44
something weird

1492.0 --> 1497.039
drawing away from yeah the power of

1494.88 --> 1499.44
christ itself

1497.039 --> 1502.0
creating yeah exactly what christ warned

1499.44 --> 1505.279
of and then they proceeded to

1502.0 --> 1507.679
embrace an entire psychological reversed

1505.279 --> 1512.32
world plan

1507.679 --> 1515.44
so they got even worse you know

1512.32 --> 1518.48
not saying that all catholics

1515.44 --> 1520.88
are a part of that thing

1518.48 --> 1522.559
because you just get born into catholic

1520.88 --> 1525.1200000000001
families and i don't know

1522.559 --> 1526.799
it's not all that bad you know but that

1525.12 --> 1528.8799999999999
is what's happening at the top it's

1526.799 --> 1530.96
what's always been happening at the top

1528.88 --> 1533.8400000000001
it's their trick

1530.96 --> 1534.88
they are like a false prophet they seem

1533.84 --> 1537.6789999999999
good they help

1534.88 --> 1539.44
out they have power but when you really

1537.679 --> 1543.8400000000001
get to look at what's going on at the

1539.44 --> 1543.8400000000001
top it's just messed up

1551.039 --> 1554.84
although one could argue that that is

1552.799 --> 1559.6
the fate of all

1554.84 --> 1559.6
huge old organizations

1559.679 --> 1564.24
that they would all naturally resolve to

1562.08 --> 1571.84
those kind of tactics

1564.24 --> 1571.84
to sustain themselves

1575.919 --> 1582.4
but yeah the darkness does creep in when

1578.799 --> 1582.4
there's a lot of power involved it's

1582.84 --> 1588.08
inescapable

1585.2 --> 1590.559
[Music]

1588.08 --> 1590.559
anyway

1594.08 --> 1599.84
peer review oh god he's invoking peer

1596.64 --> 1599.8400000000001
review is he

1600.88 --> 1607.2
oh yeah sorry dude

1604.0 --> 1611.039
mr jones consensus does not

1607.2 --> 1613.8400000000001
determine reality if you think that

1611.039 --> 1613.84
you got a problem

1614.24 --> 1622.08
fantasies agreed upon are not reality

1618.88 --> 1622.0800000000002
it has to be tested

1622.799 --> 1628.799
empirically scientifically

1626.24 --> 1631.2
applying the scientific method and then

1628.799 --> 1633.76
you got something

1631.2 --> 1635.76
that you can really put out and then

1633.76 --> 1639.679
others could peer review it

1635.76 --> 1643.039
not to give their opinions about it

1639.679 --> 1646.0800000000002
but to determine if it is indeed

1643.039 --> 1646.8799999999999
correct and they do it themselves and

1646.08 --> 1649.84
then

1646.88 --> 1651.1200000000001
figure out whether it does work out or

1649.84 --> 1653.1999999999998
if it doesn't

1651.12 --> 1655.1999999999998
now that's the proper function of a peer

1653.2 --> 1657.1200000000001
review in science

1655.2 --> 1659.2
but yeah it's turned into just this

1657.12 --> 1662.08
consensus little book club

1659.2 --> 1662.0800000000002
of blabbers

1667.44 --> 1672.0800000000002
oh shut up mr jones you don't know

1669.6 --> 1672.08
anything

1680.84 --> 1683.84
idiot

1708.84 --> 1711.84
hmm

1724.399 --> 1731.12
huh well if he signs i think that

1728.96 --> 1732.88
concerning athletes the fraudulent

1731.12 --> 1735.12
aspect

1732.88 --> 1736.5590000000002
that yeah i'm gonna take this very i do

1735.12 --> 1739.9189999999999
this every time

1736.559 --> 1741.76
says you can you find fraudulent

1739.919 --> 1743.279
fraudulent athletes does that mean that

1741.76 --> 1745.76
all athletes are fraudulent

1743.279 --> 1747.84
well that depends because what is

1745.76 --> 1750.0
considered fraud among athletes

1747.84 --> 1751.039
is much more convention based it's much

1750.0 --> 1754.24
more weight

1751.039 --> 1757.44
you cannot use these drugs

1754.24 --> 1758.48
and if you do you have a problem and

1757.44 --> 1761.039
that changes

1758.48 --> 1763.039
so does that make them fraudulent no

1761.039 --> 1766.64
it's only fraudulent when they break

1763.039 --> 1768.559
those convention-based rules

1766.64 --> 1771.3600000000001
right it's not the same thing as science

1768.559 --> 1775.039
science is not based on

1771.36 --> 1775.9189999999999
just conventions like decisions on how

1775.039 --> 1778.8799999999999
to approach

1775.919 --> 1779.76
something it's based on empiricism on

1778.88 --> 1782.3200000000002
physical

1779.76 --> 1782.32
results

1789.2 --> 1795.52
what okay well so do i because there is

1793.2 --> 1798.64
a huge amount of evidence for an

1795.52 --> 1798.6399999999999
existence of god

1799.12 --> 1803.36
in the very concept of information

1801.36 --> 1806.08
there's so many leads

1803.36 --> 1807.279
the only way that a truly informed

1806.08 --> 1810.559
person would deny

1807.279 --> 1814.08
god is if they just

1810.559 --> 1814.08
refuse to accept it

1816.88 --> 1819.44
yeah there is

1820.559 --> 1824.48
now that doesn't mean that what you

1823.2 --> 1827.679
think

1824.48 --> 1829.6
god is is out there

1827.679 --> 1830.96
right that you're actually straw manning

1829.6 --> 1836.9599999999998
us with your cheap

1830.96 --> 1840.24
ass conception of god right yeah

1836.96 --> 1841.76
i i'm certainly willing to go along with

1840.24 --> 1844.48
the idea that you're not

1841.76 --> 1847.44
properly able to understand or even

1844.48 --> 1850.72
conceive of what the creator really is

1847.44 --> 1853.6000000000001
absolutely but he is there because he

1850.72 --> 1853.6000000000001
must be there

1854.799 --> 1858.0
because of the nature of the designs of

1857.039 --> 1861.279
all things of

1858.0 --> 1865.44
nature itself of genetics

1861.279 --> 1867.919
of the realm it cannot have formed

1865.44 --> 1868.64
out of itself by its own volition by

1867.919 --> 1871.76
some

1868.64 --> 1873.6000000000001
natural process none of it could have

1871.76 --> 1877.12
all these things prove there is

1873.6 --> 1879.36
definitely a creator a designer

1877.12 --> 1881.6789999999999
almost like the programmer of a computer

1879.36 --> 1881.6789999999999
game

1882.08 --> 1888.1589999999999
as a raw comparison to

1885.12 --> 1890.6399999999999
to basically divide the

1888.159 --> 1893.2
the power structure in a way that's more

1890.64 --> 1895.2
understandable for people

1893.2 --> 1896.96
it's not that literally but it's like

1895.2 --> 1900.559
that and that's

1896.96 --> 1903.8400000000001
just it it's impossible for there

1900.559 --> 1906.08
not to be that

1903.84 --> 1907.1999999999998
that's what people have figured out when

1906.08 --> 1909.9189999999999
they really

1907.2 --> 1910.96
do their research i'm sorry you don't

1909.919 --> 1915.519
like that

1910.96 --> 1915.519
mr jones that's just factual

1917.279 --> 1924.559
nothing can come into being

1920.399 --> 1924.559
by itself well not in the material realm

1926.159 --> 1935.8400000000001
and god is not of the material realm

1939.919 --> 1943.76
yes it is mr jones

1945.2 --> 1963.8400000000001
that's absolutely evidence it's natural

1948.88 --> 1963.8400000000001
consequence based evidence

1979.039 --> 1991.84
all right

1994.159 --> 1998.3200000000002
now there is evidence the earth is flat

1996.159 --> 2001.519
it's not scientific evidence

1998.32 --> 2004.8799999999999
but it's definitely good evidence

2001.519 --> 2008.24
lack of curvature too farsighted to low

2004.88 --> 2013.44
observation height these are all

2008.24 --> 2013.44
just empirical based evidences

2013.919 --> 2016.96
you cross reference that with all the

2015.919 --> 2019.039
knowledge

2016.96 --> 2020.799
gathered through optics the testing of

2019.039 --> 2022.799
lenses and all that

2020.799 --> 2024.32
and then yeah the only remaining

2022.799 --> 2027.519
conclusion is is that

2024.32 --> 2030.399
all the evidence points out that

2027.519 --> 2032.08
the orientation the geometrical

2030.399 --> 2035.6399999999999
orientation of the surface

2032.08 --> 2040.08
of earth at any point is flat and it

2035.64 --> 2040.0800000000002
interconnects flat

2040.64 --> 2046.88
just like the big euclidean

2043.679 --> 2048.56
database that gps utilizes

2046.88 --> 2051.28
in order to get these perfect

2048.56 --> 2051.2799999999997
coordinates

2052.05 --> 2055.1290000000004
[Music]

2071.919 --> 2077.839
get out of here and i'm done with you

2074.48 --> 2080.639
for today mr jones

2077.839 --> 2082.399
this level of retardation i'm not gonna

2080.639 --> 2084.2400000000002
let you go there

2082.399 --> 2085.7599999999998
if if that's what you're gonna be doing

2084.24 --> 2088.7999999999997
now then you can just

2085.76 --> 2091.679
stick to the flat earth debate chat with

2088.8 --> 2091.679
the other trolls

2096.32 --> 2099.44
yeah look if you're just trying to make

2099.2 --> 2102.16
an

2099.44 --> 2103.28
argument that's fine if you're gonna say

2102.16 --> 2106.3199999999997
absolutely

2103.28 --> 2109.44
stupid things like the black swan

2106.32 --> 2112.96
is debunked then you are just a

2109.44 --> 2114.56
very dumb shitty troll at that point

2112.96 --> 2116.079
and then i'm gonna punish you by timing

2114.56 --> 2118.88
you out which is a very

2116.079 --> 2118.88
mild punishment

2124.0 --> 2129.28
yeah but yeah

2127.119 --> 2131.119
my time with you is starting to run out

2129.28 --> 2134.88
if this is the course

2131.119 --> 2136.7200000000003
where you're going at now from here on

2134.88 --> 2138.8
so i warn you if you're gonna keep up

2136.72 --> 2140.8799999999997
this level i will ban you and i will not

2138.8 --> 2143.92
regret it

2140.88 --> 2144.2400000000002
i've already had plenty of material that

2143.92 --> 2147.119
i've

2144.24 --> 2148.3999999999996
extracted from your presence and your

2147.119 --> 2151.76
words here yet

2148.4 --> 2154.56
so i basically got

2151.76 --> 2156.4
everything i wanted if this is the level

2154.56 --> 2159.839
that you're now going to

2156.4 --> 2159.839
get into next

2160.16 --> 2164.16
means that the viable virtual resource

2163.44 --> 2166.8
that i can

2164.16 --> 2169.2799999999997
extract from you as a person with your

2166.8 --> 2173.04
presence here is running out

2169.28 --> 2186.48
no more value in keeping you around

2173.04 --> 2190.24
do you understand mr jones

2186.48 --> 2190.2400000000002
oh dank that sucks

2192.64 --> 2197.92
well then look if you have if you're

2195.839 --> 2199.2
more often having trouble and this by

2197.92 --> 2200.56
the way accounts for everyone if you're

2199.2 --> 2202.24
having trouble

2200.56 --> 2203.92
finding my live stream even though you

2202.24 --> 2204.24
know i'm supposed to be going live at

2203.92 --> 2207.359
two

2204.24 --> 2208.3199999999997
sometimes i start a little late rarely

2207.359 --> 2210.3199999999997
very late

2208.32 --> 2212.2400000000002
usually not more than like 10 minutes or

2210.32 --> 2217.28
something

2212.24 --> 2220.72
go to my channel click on videos

2217.28 --> 2223.28
wait there and refresh

2220.72 --> 2224.56
every now and then and there it should

2223.28 --> 2226.6400000000003
pop up immediately

2224.56 --> 2227.68
whatever pop-ups on the bottom of your

2226.64 --> 2229.68
screen or

2227.68 --> 2232.3199999999997
in the notifications are going to do

2229.68 --> 2236.0789999999997
that is where you just see it

2232.32 --> 2237.6800000000003
that's how i catch on to it

2236.079 --> 2240.48
because i don't see it in the front page

2237.68 --> 2243.52
of my screen anymore so just go

2240.48 --> 2247.44
to videos on my youtube channel

2243.52 --> 2247.44
when you see the list of early birds

2247.839 --> 2252.32
and then refresh it until you see

2254.839 --> 2271.839
live

2257.44 --> 2271.839
hope that helps

2286.8 --> 2292.8
all right yeah roger

2290.079 --> 2295.04
about global's never conceding well to

2292.8 --> 2297.52
the black swan is obvious especially now

2295.04 --> 2300.96
that the black swan has

2297.52 --> 2303.839
the key to the paradox

2300.96 --> 2305.52
of terrestrial refraction with him as a

2303.839 --> 2307.44
weapon

2305.52 --> 2310.72
maybe that's like the black swan's gun

2307.44 --> 2310.7200000000003
that he's wielding in the picture

2311.44 --> 2316.56
right it's the paradox well of course if

2314.96 --> 2319.119
you're gonna

2316.56 --> 2320.0
address that directly yeah then they

2319.119 --> 2322.6400000000003
might say oh

2320.0 --> 2324.0
to paradox is a quick deflection but i

2322.64 --> 2327.2
didn't even bring it up

2324.0 --> 2330.079
i didn't even bring up the word black

2327.2 --> 2333.2799999999997
swan or a direct reference to that i i

2330.079 --> 2334.1600000000003
i generalized it and drew in other

2333.28 --> 2337.599
things and then

2334.16 --> 2340.0
he brought it up that's

2337.599 --> 2340.6400000000003
when you become a troll if i would have

2340.0 --> 2342.88
said

2340.64 --> 2345.1189999999997
black swan black swan and he would say

2342.88 --> 2347.119
oh black swan has been debunked

2345.119 --> 2350.48
i wouldn't have timed him out for that

2347.119 --> 2353.6800000000003
because then he's only defending himself

2350.48 --> 2354.0
see it wasn't addressing him on that so

2353.68 --> 2369.839
he's

2354.0 --> 2369.839
just being a troll

2380.839 --> 2383.839
hmm

2395.839 --> 2399.2799999999997
facebook oh dear

2403.359 --> 2409.68
i don't have a facebook page and after i

2406.88 --> 2412.48
saw that south park episode

2409.68 --> 2413.839
zero friends i was very glad that i

2412.48 --> 2424.2400000000002
didn't

2413.839 --> 2426.4
if you know what i mean

2424.24 --> 2439.359
but hey if it worked for you it worked

2426.4 --> 2442.319
for you

2439.359 --> 2443.2
because facebook is like a giant

2442.319 --> 2447.52
information

2443.2 --> 2450.24
pen it it treats its people like cattle

2447.52 --> 2452.319
and compartmentalizes them it it drains

2450.24 --> 2455.2799999999997
their metadata

2452.319 --> 2456.4
to a very aggressive level it's a farm

2455.28 --> 2459.76
it's an information

2456.4 --> 2460.7200000000003
farm it's kind of and it's very

2459.76 --> 2462.96
patronizing

2460.72 --> 2467.839
they've always had that attitude it's

2462.96 --> 2467.839
only grown worse

2468.56 --> 2474.0
facebook is the cure for

2471.76 --> 2474.0
what

2477.2 --> 2481.839
that's ridiculous

2510.079 --> 2515.3590000000004
it's a covet super spreader oh dear

2518.4 --> 2523.359
well it they could certainly be

2521.119 --> 2527.76
classified under

2523.359 --> 2537.839
covet hysteria super spreaders

2527.76 --> 2537.8390000000004
they're definitely onto that

2549.68 --> 2555.04
that that would be kind of catchy to use

2552.88 --> 2556.96
in the face of the whole situation

2555.04 --> 2559.2799999999997
because like coveted super spread

2556.96 --> 2561.359
is like a trigger word like within their

2559.28 --> 2565.2000000000003
fear paradigm right

2561.359 --> 2568.88
if you just call it covet

2565.2 --> 2571.4399999999996
panic or covet fear

2568.88 --> 2572.8
fear mongering super spreader if you put

2571.44 --> 2577.44
it in there

2572.8 --> 2577.44
that's like an immediate counter attack

2577.68 --> 2582.72
because it also shows to the people that

2580.079 --> 2593.8390000000004
basically utilize that vernacular

2582.72 --> 2593.839
part of their system more what it is

2594.48 --> 2600.319
to people that are like really deep into

2596.88 --> 2600.319
virus mania and all that

2603.04 --> 2606.8
if you just make them realize dude it's

2604.8 --> 2610.7200000000003
a virus of the mind it's

2606.8 --> 2610.7200000000003
you constantly thinking about it and

2610.88 --> 2615.359
worrying or panicking or being concerned

2613.52 --> 2617.28
and other people not catching on and

2615.359 --> 2619.44
then you worrying for them and your

2617.28 --> 2621.8390000000004
fantasy goes in all directions it drives

2619.44 --> 2621.839
you insane

2621.92 --> 2634.8
eventually if you just score too much

2624.88 --> 2636.96
over it

2634.8 --> 2639.599
dude why are you getting tested in the

2636.96 --> 2639.599
first place

2645.28 --> 2650.0
the test doesn't work if i'm gonna take

2648.16 --> 2650.96
a test for something like this they have

2650.0 --> 2655.28
to prove

2650.96 --> 2662.8
to me that it actually works

2655.28 --> 2666.8
because it doesn't

2662.8 --> 2677.8390000000004
it doesn't test the thing

2666.8 --> 2677.8390000000004
it is designated to test doesn't work

2686.72 --> 2691.1189999999997
common cold now has a test this

2689.44 --> 2694.48
shouldn't be too difficult

2691.119 --> 2696.319
you just look at the symptoms

2694.48 --> 2705.839
it's very obvious when somebody's having

2696.319 --> 2705.839
a cold very obvious

2724.72 --> 2729.52
smell and taste high temperature okay

2729.839 --> 2736.319
oh you probably needed it as in you

2733.04 --> 2747.839
needed the metabolic overhaul which

2736.319 --> 2747.839
yeah that type of sickness really is

2759.44 --> 2766.64
yeah i know it's it's annoying as [ __ ]

2763.599 --> 2767.28
because they keep on pushing like the

2766.64 --> 2770.56
people

2767.28 --> 2773.599
really don't want it i think on average

2770.56 --> 2776.72
dutch people just because of our

2773.599 --> 2780.8
nature i guess are on average more

2776.72 --> 2784.0
well-informed even the the common folk

2780.8 --> 2787.52
because they're dutch can't help it

2784.0 --> 2790.8
it's like our thing in a way

2787.52 --> 2793.119
even for yeah dumb people so

2790.8 --> 2796.88
we're sick of it and yet they keep on

2793.119 --> 2796.88
pushing it and trying to push everyone

2800.839 --> 2803.839
around

2811.359 --> 2814.96
yeah stop at traffic in my restaurant

2813.119 --> 2818.6400000000003
well that's basically what it

2814.96 --> 2818.64
will turn out into

2820.96 --> 2825.359
so yeah they've yet yeah they've managed

2824.0 --> 2828.839
to criminalize a

2825.359 --> 2831.839
a natural part of our being isn't that

2828.839 --> 2831.839
great

2838.4 --> 2845.28
remember that when yeah back in the day

2841.92 --> 2847.119
when you would get a cold and yeah

2845.28 --> 2849.44
you know yeah like at work or something

2847.119 --> 2851.359
and yeah they would just tell you okay

2849.44 --> 2854.079
just go home

2851.359 --> 2854.4
just get belle well better not everybody

2854.079 --> 2856.8390000000004
look

2854.4 --> 2859.359
oh no i don't want to catch it no

2856.839 --> 2861.359
because that's not how it works

2859.359 --> 2863.52
and if people don't think about it too

2861.359 --> 2866.4
much they just go with

2863.52 --> 2868.079
how it really works subconsciously now

2866.4 --> 2870.88
that everybody's panicking it's like oh

2868.079 --> 2872.86
my god that person has a cold

2870.88 --> 2874.079
what if it's cove

2872.86 --> 2877.359
[Music]

2874.079 --> 2877.3590000000004
it's so nonsensical

2885.599 --> 2889.44
right yeah stopping trafficking arrested

2887.68 --> 2892.0789999999997
i was reminded about that that

2889.44 --> 2893.04
also the definition of pandemic has just

2892.079 --> 2897.76
been changed

2893.04 --> 2900.319
so they basically did a lawyer trick

2897.76 --> 2901.5200000000004
change the rules quickly in order to be

2900.319 --> 2904.5589999999997
able to

2901.52 --> 2907.839
declare an emer pandemic emergency

2904.559 --> 2912.0
falsely so it is really

2907.839 --> 2912.0
like a type of power grab

2913.359 --> 2920.0
by just lowering the threshold

2917.119 --> 2920.0
dramatically

2925.599 --> 2929.839
to invoke their powers as it were it's

2927.76 --> 2933.92
it's idiotic

2929.839 --> 2933.92
that people are just allowing this to

2940.839 --> 2943.839
happen

2950.48 --> 2956.559
getting ridiculed for taking sick days

2952.4 --> 2959.44
off from work

2956.559 --> 2961.0400000000004
right well if you just have a a bit of a

2959.44 --> 2962.4
cold you know you're a [ __ ] sniffy

2961.04 --> 2963.2
maybe you have to blow your nose every

2962.4 --> 2966.079
now and then

2963.2 --> 2967.2
yeah of course that's that's not

2966.079 --> 2968.6400000000003
necessarily

2967.2 --> 2970.72
good enough reason to stay home

2968.64 --> 2971.52
especially if you're like really needed

2970.72 --> 2974.72
at your job

2971.52 --> 2976.72
i get that if you're like really bad

2974.72 --> 2977.839
cold and like feverish [ __ ] and you

2976.72 --> 2981.04
can't focus yet

2977.839 --> 2984.16
come on that's

2981.04 --> 2986.24
not healthy it could be dangerous

2984.16 --> 2989.839
depending on what your work is

2986.24 --> 2992.16
so you know it's about

2989.839 --> 2994.48
how well can you still do things or what

2992.16 --> 2999.839
are the consequences

2994.48 --> 2999.839
if you just keep on working

3010.839 --> 3013.839
hey

3055.68 --> 3059.7599999999998
well tony okay what you're describing

3061.599 --> 3065.28
yeah if you like can't get out of bed

3063.76 --> 3066.079
and [ __ ] it's probably then it would

3065.28 --> 3069.28
kind of be

3066.079 --> 3071.52
classified for flu not just having a

3069.28 --> 3071.52
cold

3071.92 --> 3083.839
or as they used to say you got it bad

3086.16 --> 3093.7599999999998
but yeah it's it's it's still

3089.839 --> 3097.119
just being sick it's just

3093.76 --> 3098.559
these things have always happened and

3097.119 --> 3103.52
it's no reason to

3098.559 --> 3106.3190000000004
suddenly hand out all these

3103.52 --> 3106.96
yeah give the government what they want

3106.319 --> 3110.5589999999997
because

3106.96 --> 3112.4
you're sick now

3110.559 --> 3114.2400000000002
if i'm going to get sick i'm just going

3112.4 --> 3116.559
to ignore it

3114.24 --> 3118.0
now not that i'm going to pretend not i

3116.559 --> 3120.2400000000002
will still just

3118.0 --> 3121.2
be responsible for myself and stick it

3120.24 --> 3124.0789999999997
out and all that

3121.2 --> 3126.319
if i'd get sick i'm not just gonna like

3124.079 --> 3128.7200000000003
oh my god maybe i do have corroder i

3126.319 --> 3134.16
need to test

3128.72 --> 3138.16
no it's ridiculous

3134.16 --> 3141.7599999999998
and the tests themselves are yeah

3138.16 --> 3145.44
you know i don't trust that

3141.76 --> 3147.5200000000004
i don't trust the tests to even function

3145.44 --> 3148.8
and i don't trust how they've been

3147.52 --> 3150.48
produced i don't trust where they're

3148.8 --> 3153.8390000000004
coming from i don't trust the people

3150.48 --> 3153.839
that made them

3154.559 --> 3158.7200000000003
or well maybe not the designers well the

3157.359 --> 3160.48
the company that

3158.72 --> 3162.72
i don't know i just don't trust the

3160.48 --> 3164.88
tests at all and i don't trust

3162.72 --> 3166.319
the doctors concerning their opinions

3164.88 --> 3170.0
about

3166.319 --> 3170.0
the flu at all

3176.079 --> 3181.44
well doctors that go with the official

3178.0 --> 3182.96
story that is

3181.44 --> 3184.4
because there's still plenty of doctors

3182.96 --> 3186.319
out there that kind of know this is all

3184.4 --> 3195.839
[ __ ]

3186.319 --> 3195.839
they're just trying to stay afloat

3201.71 --> 3204.76
[Music]

3218.89 --> 3222.0899999999997
[Music]

3228.4 --> 3232.079
no there is not mn

3234.96 --> 3237.839
there is not

3240.96 --> 3245.52
this this idea of this mutation

3245.76 --> 3252.96
doesn't work like that it's not an

3248.88 --> 3252.96
entity that is mutating

3253.68 --> 3257.5989999999997
it's not an invasive thing

3258.079 --> 3262.6400000000003
it's microbiology it's part of the

3261.28 --> 3266.2400000000002
natural

3262.64 --> 3266.8799999999997
fabric of what mammals at least maybe

3266.24 --> 3269.2799999999997
all life

3266.88 --> 3271.04
are there's just virus particles there

3269.28 --> 3275.3590000000004
are a mechanism in our body

3271.04 --> 3275.359
and it does change

3275.52 --> 3279.68
the body like that undergoes

3278.44 --> 3284.799
microbiology

3279.68 --> 3287.44
biological changes so the way

3284.799 --> 3290.16
certain symptoms will start to express

3287.44 --> 3294.16
themselves when you go into the

3290.16 --> 3297.68
disease state or into the cleanup phase

3294.16 --> 3300.0789999999997
for metabolism yeah they might

3297.68 --> 3302.24
migrate they might change its focus it

3300.079 --> 3304.96
might work slightly differently

3302.24 --> 3306.0
but it's still basically a mechanism of

3304.96 --> 3309.599
the body that

3306.0 --> 3309.599
is there for a purpose

3316.64 --> 3323.1189999999997
like getting sick can clear

3320.079 --> 3326.7200000000003
you up a lot can clean you up

3323.119 --> 3329.44
especially if you're if you have

3326.72 --> 3331.1189999999997
yeah bad food habits and all that

3329.44 --> 3331.92
because then all this junk remains in

3331.119 --> 3335.6800000000003
your body

3331.92 --> 3337.359
to the cellular level sometimes

3335.68 --> 3338.8799999999997
and then when you get sick yeah you get

3337.359 --> 3339.839
really punished from the sickness

3338.88 --> 3343.119
because there's so much

3339.839 --> 3343.839
junk to clean up but after it's been

3343.119 --> 3346.0
cleaned up

3343.839 --> 3347.599
if you've done it properly and not just

3346.0 --> 3349.44
kept stuffing yourself with

3347.599 --> 3351.3590000000004
disgusting junk food even when you're

3349.44 --> 3353.2000000000003
sick instead of just

3351.359 --> 3356.319
drinking chicken soup and all that you

3353.2 --> 3356.319
know the good stuff

3356.88 --> 3362.4
yeah afterward if you stick it out right

3360.16 --> 3363.68
yeah you will suddenly feel clearer and

3362.4 --> 3366.64
more focused

3363.68 --> 3367.9199999999996
than ever before because it cleaned you

3366.64 --> 3377.839
up

3367.92 --> 3377.839
that's what it does

3387.76 --> 3391.44
wow seeking star wars thank you for that

3390.079 --> 3394.6400000000003
i

3391.44 --> 3396.64
he did did he refute it just like newton

3394.64 --> 3399.52
refuted gravity

3396.64 --> 3401.839
that's amazing well on his deathbed

3399.52 --> 3401.839
really

3402.839 --> 3406.96
that's i didn't know that

3415.76 --> 3420.3190000000004
you must have figured out the

3417.76 --> 3423.76
implications of it

3420.319 --> 3425.2799999999997
like how it would be abused and was like

3423.76 --> 3429.5200000000004
oh god no

3425.28 --> 3429.52
i have to fix this or i'm going to hell

3430.24 --> 3433.839
i could imagine

3436.4 --> 3440.48
terrain theory all right all right right

3439.2 --> 3441.4399999999996
well that's what i'm following i'm

3440.48 --> 3443.359
following that

3441.44 --> 3444.7200000000003
terrain theory that's why i emphasize

3443.359 --> 3448.5589999999997
the microbiology and

3444.72 --> 3451.68
cycles clean up cycle functionality

3448.559 --> 3455.3590000000004
of the process and it's

3451.68 --> 3457.52
also much more

3455.359 --> 3459.2
synchronized with the concepts of german

3457.52 --> 3461.7599999999998
new medicine which approach it

3459.2 --> 3462.72
even more differently more through the

3461.76 --> 3466.3190000000004
psyche

3462.72 --> 3469.68
and through spiritual energy cycles

3466.319 --> 3470.88
so now on another level it's very

3469.68 --> 3475.2799999999997
fascinating

3470.88 --> 3477.599
but yeah terrain theory works

3475.28 --> 3478.3190000000004
can basically work out great together

3477.599 --> 3481.799
with the

3478.319 --> 3488.079
the the newer alternatives

3481.799 --> 3491.359
non-allopathic medical approaches

3488.079 --> 3494.4
it's it really all comes down to just

3491.359 --> 3498.319
don't poison yourself

3494.4 --> 3501.599
how ironic that literally the word virus

3498.319 --> 3504.4
was originally just means poison

3501.599 --> 3516.0
how how ironic just don't poison

3504.4 --> 3518.88
yourself that's the trick

3516.0 --> 3519.28
ah anyway i'm gonna round out the show

3518.88 --> 3522.4
guys

3519.28 --> 3522.4
it was pretty good i think

3528.0 --> 3536.24
bacon i remember

3531.119 --> 3538.6400000000003
i remember that that's a dutch guy right

3536.24 --> 3538.64
rj

3540.72 --> 3545.2
or german i don't know anyway it's been

3543.44 --> 3548.16
interesting

3545.2 --> 3549.1189999999997
