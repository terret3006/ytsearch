i have no idea why

118.64 --> 122.159
let's put up the decibels

okay

140.4 --> 146.56
yeah the weather today is

142.879 --> 146.56
quite beautiful actually

146.72 --> 150.64
there's less haze

148.64 --> 154.07999999999998
than there was yesterday it seems like

150.64 --> 154.07999999999998
they were like chemtrailing

154.16 --> 158.239
yeah i almost call it chem trailing but

156.48 --> 160.48
i don't know what what it is

158.239 --> 162.48000000000002
there were so much so much trails

160.48 --> 165.44
yesterday that by the evening it was

162.48 --> 168.0
completely hazy

165.44 --> 169.519
and it did cool off again kind of like i

168.0 --> 171.04
predicted

169.519 --> 174.0
seem to be having

171.04 --> 177.84
nice warm mornings and early afternoons

174.0 --> 177.84
and then it kind of just gets colder

178.8 --> 185.0
and today yeah it seems

180.959 --> 185.0
there's less clouds even

187.76 --> 193.12
it's really wind still

190.879 --> 196.51899999999998
right now at least

193.12 --> 196.519
so yeah

205.84 --> 210.84
hello mike's adonitch first in chat

209.36 --> 215.12
nicole

210.84 --> 215.12
welcome good to see you

216.72 --> 223.239
it is wednesday the 22nd of september

220.239 --> 223.239
2021

224.159 --> 227.84
hello slo-mo moon buggy

228.4 --> 233.59900000000002
right

229.68 --> 235.59900000000002
and yeah i had a pretty tense day

233.599 --> 236.56
yesterday

235.599 --> 239.11999999999998
very

236.56 --> 240.799
relieved to get a call from my healer

239.12 --> 242.4
this morning after i tried to call him

240.799 --> 245.92000000000002
because

242.4 --> 245.92000000000002
i don't know yesterday

246.4 --> 252.56
i didn't watch my show back

248.959 --> 255.599
but it clung to memory pretty

252.56 --> 257.919
and yeah pretty tenaciously

255.599 --> 259.44
i felt like i went too far

257.919 --> 262.32
i kind of got up

259.44 --> 262.32
got caught up

262.72 --> 265.91900000000004
in my attuning

266.84 --> 272.79999999999995
and it felt almost literally like in

270.479 --> 276.639
that moment i was getting possessed

272.8 --> 279.12
and then that possession kind of took

276.639 --> 282.56
my anger

279.12 --> 284.96
and kind of like burned it all up so in

282.56 --> 286.88
a sense it was a controlled burn but i

284.96 --> 289.68
just said things that

286.88 --> 293.71999999999997
when i carefully reflect upon them

289.68 --> 293.72
it wasn't all perfect

296.639 --> 300.32
it's a weird sensation and that tension

298.72 --> 303.84000000000003
hung with me like okay as it made

300.32 --> 303.84
certain statements that are

304.479 --> 308.4
yeah the spirit of them where they come

306.32 --> 311.639
from it's an honest impulse of what

308.4 --> 311.63899999999995
would happen

312.96 --> 317.52
but still i don't know

315.12 --> 317.52
anyway

320.0 --> 325.28
i feel a lot better now and

322.16 --> 327.84000000000003
yeah well i was gonna address it

325.28 --> 327.84
so i am

329.44 --> 333.28
gonna feel it to heal it yeah yeah

337.44 --> 340.8
it's just that it kind of switched to

339.68 --> 343.919
this

340.8 --> 345.36
obsession of just route them all out

343.919 --> 347.68
and i went

345.36 --> 349.52000000000004
just over certain borders with language

347.68 --> 352.24
and i thought originally i was going to

349.52 --> 355.59999999999997
make some kind of a point but in

352.24 --> 357.039
retrospect it seemed like i deceived

355.6 --> 360.03900000000004
myself

357.039 --> 360.039
partially

367.44 --> 372.96
yeah what i do sometimes on my show is

370.24 --> 372.96000000000004
really weird

375.12 --> 381.44
i guess

377.52 --> 383.68
i i have not seen others really

381.44 --> 384.639
do things like that

383.68 --> 389.12
in the

384.639 --> 393.88
mixture of what i have to present

389.12 --> 393.88
uh what happened well i just got

397.12 --> 402.96
i basically went in on like a revenge

400.0 --> 405.199
spiral towards

402.96 --> 405.19899999999996
the

405.44 --> 409.919
well

406.56 --> 413.12
the group of people that are basically

409.919 --> 414.79999999999995
setting up this world the way it is

413.12 --> 417.44
and that are introducing all these

414.8 --> 419.599
ruining factors

417.44 --> 422.16
that that's it and i know there's a lot

419.599 --> 424.71999999999997
of people that have massive frustration

422.16 --> 427.759
and even obsession with that

424.72 --> 429.68
but when i entered into that mindset to

427.759 --> 430.88
kind of translate it

429.68 --> 432.479
i

430.88 --> 435.36
went too far

432.479 --> 437.84
i lost i lost grip and it took me

435.36 --> 437.84000000000003
instead

445.36 --> 450.47900000000004
it is pretty over yes i know

448.84 --> 453.44
but

450.479 --> 457.039
that doesn't make it right

453.44 --> 457.039
because i should be

459.84 --> 465.11999999999995
i shouldn't be prioritizing that

462.639 --> 468.8
emphasis over

465.12 --> 468.8
the long-term mission

471.43 --> 476.0
[Music]

473.68 --> 479.44
because it kind of ruins my other

476.0 --> 482.0
carefully laid out points

479.44 --> 482.0
it's like

485.039 --> 489.28
like jesus wouldn't say those things not

487.36 --> 491.759
like that

489.28 --> 495.75899999999996
right and he jesus did get

491.759 --> 495.759
pretty pissed off at times

496.319 --> 500.72
but yeah i felt like in it when i did

499.44 --> 503.039
that i

500.72 --> 504.84000000000003
i stepped away from the narrowness of

503.039 --> 509.199
the

504.84 --> 509.19899999999996
path and i want back

509.52 --> 512.959
i want to fix that i want to somehow get

511.599 --> 514.959
it

512.959 --> 517.1999999999999
better under control it's already a lot

514.959 --> 519.3599999999999
better under control than it used to be

517.2 --> 520.9590000000001
because i've even explained on the early

519.36 --> 523.12
bird show

520.959 --> 525.0
a year ago and more that sometimes we've

523.12 --> 526.88
just had these periods where just get

525.0 --> 529.36
deceiving

526.88 --> 531.76
seething rage

529.36 --> 534.72
just this undirected like

531.76 --> 537.6
drift like destroy destroy destroy it's

534.72 --> 540.399
crazy and it's extremely unproductive

537.6 --> 541.9200000000001
and it's like when that happens

540.399 --> 544.959
well then i don't have grip i'm

541.92 --> 546.56
literally staring at a part of myself

544.959 --> 548.56
that is just like

546.56 --> 551.1999999999999
doing that and i don't know how to stop

548.56 --> 554.399
it except for just

551.2 --> 556.9590000000001
throw it out there like throwing up

554.399 --> 556.959
energy

558.08 --> 563.9200000000001
right and it also relates and this is

560.88 --> 567.4399999999999
from my healer it relates to

563.92 --> 569.8389999999999
what he's identified as the

567.44 --> 572.399
spirit of fakeness

569.839 --> 574.5600000000001
which could also be identified as like

572.399 --> 577.44
the same spirit that

574.56 --> 579.76
goes through people when they go into

577.44 --> 582.8800000000001
the typical double think

579.76 --> 582.88
ways of going about

584.399 --> 588.64
and it is very disturbing especially to

587.12 --> 590.399
people that are very

588.64 --> 592.3199999999999
sensitive and

590.399 --> 595.12
see a lot of psychological things it's

592.32 --> 597.6800000000001
very punishing and that is kind of what

595.12 --> 600.48
does feed for me into

597.68 --> 602.8389999999999
the severity of the rage

600.48 --> 606.9590000000001
it's like i'm so

602.839 --> 606.9590000000001
dissatisfied with the setup

608.48 --> 612.24
and i get impatient

615.2 --> 622.1600000000001
and restless but anyway i think i got it

618.959 --> 622.16
under control right now

623.6 --> 627.36
yeah tensions are sometimes a little

625.519 --> 629.6
tough on me

627.36 --> 629.6
right

631.6 --> 636.5600000000001
anyway hello dustyrider

633.92 --> 636.56
humblebee

644.079 --> 649.12
right but yeah besides that point where

647.2 --> 651.36
i feel i went too far

649.12 --> 653.36
and guys i haven't actually watched it

651.36 --> 656.5600000000001
back yet i should have it's just that it

653.36 --> 656.5600000000001
makes me really nervous

657.04 --> 661.92
but i don't know maybe it wasn't as bad

659.36 --> 664.16
as what it felt like in my head

661.92 --> 666.88
because sometimes that does happen

664.16 --> 669.92
especially when i get carried away

666.88 --> 672.72
in my memory more happens than ends up

669.92 --> 675.8389999999999
actually on screen happening

672.72 --> 675.839
it's weird

689.12 --> 693.44
it's almost like i get so carried away

691.76 --> 695.8389999999999
that the energy of it

693.44 --> 698.0
makes me hallucinate in between what i

695.839 --> 698.0
do

699.839 --> 707.2790000000001
but it's a it's not like a

704.24 --> 710.32
it's a controlled hallucination almost

707.279 --> 712.16
like a micro dream to be able to vent

710.32 --> 713.6800000000001
off something

712.16 --> 715.76
virtually

713.68 --> 716.959
without actually throwing it out there i

715.76 --> 718.959
don't know it's

716.959 --> 720.6389999999999
it's something i need to study a little

718.959 --> 723.92
bit more often

720.639 --> 725.519
because it is a weird thing of mine that

723.92 --> 728.519
i have detected

725.519 --> 728.519
anyway

731.279 --> 736.079
all right i've been having great

733.6 --> 739.2
conversations though yesterday like

736.079 --> 739.1999999999999
during the after show

739.519 --> 741.76
uh

742.56 --> 749.5189999999999
it just had a great talk with adam

745.76 --> 749.519
like way after most left

750.8 --> 753.12
uh

753.36 --> 757.839
right also kiwi live i wasn't there on

756.56 --> 759.92
the panel

757.839 --> 762.24
but it wasn't yet and it was it was

759.92 --> 763.12
great

762.24 --> 766.72
had

763.12 --> 770.68
massive inspiration for horror puns

766.72 --> 770.6800000000001
it just kept on coming

773.68 --> 778.7199999999999
like the four horsemen of the apocalypse

780.48 --> 784.5600000000001
etc etc it's it's endless

785.6 --> 789.0400000000001
hello flat bastard

792.639 --> 795.639
right

804.88 --> 809.2
right it kind of missed out and made by

806.639 --> 810.639
jimbo but it's because i don't know

809.2 --> 812.72
it's almost like he had some technical

810.639 --> 814.88
difficulties or something

812.72 --> 816.8000000000001
i missed out on it

814.88 --> 820.68
not sure about metro from australia

816.8 --> 820.68
whether it was there live

832.399 --> 835.92
i don't know

833.44 --> 837.1990000000001
in a way i also kind of want to take it

835.92 --> 838.959
easy a little

837.199 --> 840.88
because yeah the

838.959 --> 843.5189999999999
several types of tensions are starting

840.88 --> 845.92
to get to me a little i need to i feel i

843.519 --> 848.8
need to take it easy anyway i have had a

845.92 --> 851.4399999999999
good sleep went to bed very early

848.8 --> 851.4399999999999
yesterday

852.48 --> 857.6800000000001
got up pretty early today

855.99 --> 859.44
[Music]

857.68 --> 861.76
all right

859.44 --> 865.6
okay dusty you don't recall me going

861.76 --> 865.6
overboard in your opinion really

866.959 --> 871.16
so me talking about

869.68 --> 872.8
like

871.16 --> 875.68
exterminating

872.8 --> 879.04
like the entire bloodline and all that

875.68 --> 882.279
like that isn't that bad

879.04 --> 882.279
kind of

886.16 --> 889.8389999999999
it's like

887.6 --> 892.639
weird i get the sensation like it's

889.839 --> 896.0790000000001
uncivilized

892.639 --> 899.6800000000001
it's definitely something that i feel

896.079 --> 903.279
but i strongly wonder whether that

899.68 --> 906.6389999999999
should ever be actually done

903.279 --> 907.68
it's more an expression of a sensation

906.639 --> 909.36
really

907.68 --> 912.56
but yeah

909.36 --> 916.16
that doesn't really matter i let go

912.56 --> 916.16
and it's not it doesn't feel good

916.48 --> 920.8000000000001
ready to get the guillotines

918.88 --> 922.16
yeah but that's so

920.8 --> 924.16
overkill

922.16 --> 927.16
the thing is it leads to

924.16 --> 927.16
dangers

928.639 --> 934.24
right

930.32 --> 934.24
because once you get the guillotines out

936.16 --> 942.639
usually the problem is

939.12 --> 945.12
once the chopping starts it's like okay

942.639 --> 946.88
bring for that one and that one and then

945.12 --> 948.5600000000001
suddenly everybody's pissed off at that

946.88 --> 949.8389999999999
person and they all suddenly consider

948.56 --> 952.16
like well

949.839 --> 954.9590000000001
we've been doing that all this time

952.16 --> 957.519
let's do it again

954.959 --> 960.16
it's scary

957.519 --> 963.16
right the existential consequences are

960.16 --> 963.16
destabilizing

963.92 --> 969.5999999999999
and i already next to what i said about

967.04 --> 970.959
that about those enraged statements

969.6 --> 974.399
specifically

970.959 --> 977.199
if you just separate

974.399 --> 981.199
the families and emphasize freedom then

977.199 --> 984.399
technically those that engage in evil

981.199 --> 986.88
as long as they only do it to themselves

984.399 --> 988.72
and their offspring which is really

986.88 --> 991.04
very painful idea

988.72 --> 993.1990000000001
that you would let them do that to their

991.04 --> 994.8389999999999
own

993.199 --> 996.959
then at

994.839 --> 999.6800000000001
least like

996.959 --> 1001.92
the basic logos rollout

999.68 --> 1004.2399999999999
will cause them to basically start

1001.92 --> 1006.88
extinguishing while those that do not do

1004.24 --> 1008.839
that and are not seduced into getting

1006.88 --> 1010.56
into that

1008.839 --> 1012.8000000000001
they

1010.56 --> 1014.079
will almost be like immunized and

1012.8 --> 1015.4399999999999
growing

1014.079 --> 1018.079
replacing

1015.44 --> 1020.399
the dying

1018.079 --> 1020.399
right

1020.88 --> 1026.559
and existentially that's a wiser tactic

1024.799 --> 1028.6399999999999
a thing that should actually be done and

1026.559 --> 1030.8799999999999
hey lots of people are saying that owen

1028.64 --> 1033.199
benjamin is constantly emphasizing that

1030.88 --> 1033.199
part

1034.559 --> 1038.6
and i do agree with that

1040.16 --> 1044.0
in high tension times that's safer

1042.16 --> 1046.16
because once you really start just

1044.0 --> 1048.64
killing off

1046.16 --> 1051.2
then before you know it people will be

1048.64 --> 1055.4
killed off that didn't really deserve

1051.2 --> 1055.4
all that wrath as much

1075.36 --> 1080.4799999999998
i don't know dusty right here hey hello

1078.16 --> 1082.24
amanda young

1080.48 --> 1084.559
right so yes some feedback would be

1082.24 --> 1084.559
great

1090.799 --> 1095.36
but i did feel i need to needed to

1093.12 --> 1097.6789999999999
address this specifically

1095.36 --> 1099.28
because i do think that i've been doing

1097.679 --> 1101.76
great

1099.28 --> 1103.28
been much more strong and cohesive and

1101.76 --> 1105.679
determined

1103.28 --> 1107.52
in the last month

1105.679 --> 1110.64
and i don't want

1107.52 --> 1112.96
a moment where i slept and in my

1110.64 --> 1115.8400000000001
feelings got to went too far i don't

1112.96 --> 1115.8400000000001
want to make that

1116.0 --> 1121.44
like if i double down on that i'd feel

1118.48 --> 1123.52
i'd commit a sin and god would kind of

1121.44 --> 1125.3600000000001
take the power away again i'd stumble

1123.52 --> 1129.08
down i don't want that to happen i don't

1125.36 --> 1129.08
want to lose this momentum

1142.64 --> 1146.88
but at the same time

1144.799 --> 1149.2
i didn't either

1146.88 --> 1151.3600000000001
want to conceal

1149.2 --> 1153.6000000000001
that i do have

1151.36 --> 1156.1599999999999
the capability of that level of rage in

1153.6 --> 1158.6399999999999
me either

1156.16 --> 1160.0
it's like there's a fire in there it's

1158.64 --> 1161.5200000000002
very

1160.0 --> 1164.16
very intense

1161.52 --> 1166.16
and sometimes i just want to show that

1164.16 --> 1169.52
it's there as well

1166.16 --> 1169.52
but it's always risky

1175.36 --> 1179.84
like it's like an emergency fire

1181.679 --> 1185.6000000000001
doomsday fire me maybe even and it

1184.32 --> 1187.9189999999999
shouldn't

1185.6 --> 1188.7199999999998
be the focus it shouldn't be like the

1187.919 --> 1193.4
thing

1188.72 --> 1193.4
you're envisioning to go there

1196.4 --> 1201.44
and i kind of only want to use it as a

1198.88 --> 1203.7600000000002
galadriel's mirror and it i hope you

1201.44 --> 1205.28
understand when i say that what that

1203.76 --> 1207.36
means

1205.28 --> 1209.36
right

1207.36 --> 1211.4399999999998
i only want to utilize it as a

1209.36 --> 1214.559
galadriel's mirror

1211.44 --> 1217.039
to try to shake people awake as to how

1214.559 --> 1219.12
bad it will get if you don't

1217.039 --> 1221.84
do what you're actually

1219.12 --> 1221.84
required to do

1231.28 --> 1235.76
and i i think so far i have used it like

1233.919 --> 1237.76
that

1235.76 --> 1239.039
every time i did let it

1237.76 --> 1241.76
get out

1239.039 --> 1241.76
on camera

1242.799 --> 1247.96
god wants me to depend on him

1248.08 --> 1252.84
well i do

1249.6 --> 1252.84
good serving

1262.4 --> 1268.48
right i

1264.72 --> 1268.48
i don't know what i do without him

1270.4 --> 1274.8400000000001
without the trust and the insight and

1272.88 --> 1279.72
the knowledge of

1274.84 --> 1279.72
his inevitable existence

1291.679 --> 1296.0800000000002
break about it yeah i do good servant

1302.64 --> 1306.88
and yeah part of that

1305.039 --> 1309.28
process the inquiry the spiritual

1306.88 --> 1311.7600000000002
inquiry is also

1309.28 --> 1316.32
communicating with my healer

1311.76 --> 1316.32
and we're very in line about that

1317.679 --> 1325.44
like very much in the same mindset right

1320.4 --> 1325.44
now and i have adapted to him because

1326.159 --> 1329.6000000000001
this just turned out to be incredibly

1328.08 --> 1331.12
wise

1329.6 --> 1333.6789999999999
because like

1331.12 --> 1334.9599999999998
is it now five years ago when i first

1333.679 --> 1338.4
met him

1334.96 --> 1339.919
i was like very burdened by

1338.4 --> 1342.24
that rage

1339.919 --> 1344.48
that i now sometimes show a glimpse of

1342.24 --> 1347.1200000000001
that was like literally haunting me

1344.48 --> 1349.44
constantly constantly

1347.12 --> 1350.9599999999998
it almost felt like a literal demon was

1349.44 --> 1354.0
on my heels

1350.96 --> 1357.919
trying to get in me there is terrible

1354.0 --> 1359.44
and that brings a lot of like delusional

1357.919 --> 1361.8400000000001
feelings

1359.44 --> 1361.8400000000001
and

1362.32 --> 1368.0
i would constantly disagree with him

1365.679 --> 1369.52
about things i would disagree with a

1368.0 --> 1370.96
whole bunch of people about things

1369.52 --> 1372.559
because i just didn't trust anything

1370.96 --> 1374.64
anymore and it just

1372.559 --> 1377.039
was trying to figure out whether

1374.64 --> 1380.0800000000002
the feelings that came forth from the

1377.039 --> 1381.52
delusion had any purposeful meaning to

1380.08 --> 1384.24
them

1381.52 --> 1385.52
but then

1384.24 --> 1389.039
i kind of

1385.52 --> 1390.96
just like surrendered a couple of times

1389.039 --> 1392.72
to certain words of wisdom that he

1390.96 --> 1396.4
brought

1392.72 --> 1399.52
and then just decided like yeah

1396.4 --> 1401.76
i have evidence that that state of mind

1399.52 --> 1404.1589999999999
brings forth ideas that are literally

1401.76 --> 1407.36
wrong and in productive as existentially

1404.159 --> 1409.8400000000001
i can point out how it's wrong whatever

1407.36 --> 1412.799
i feel about it right now and i need to

1409.84 --> 1414.0
stop it so i am going to adapt to those

1412.799 --> 1415.679
principles

1414.0 --> 1416.4
those mechanisms

1415.679 --> 1419.2
through

1416.4 --> 1422.0800000000002
rudolph steiner's legacy

1419.2 --> 1424.4
and it's worked out

1422.08 --> 1428.08
really great

1424.4 --> 1430.96
and the more focused i become the more

1428.08 --> 1433.279
it starts to stand out to me

1430.96 --> 1436.48
how good a choice there really was

1433.279 --> 1438.32
because it was correct

1436.48 --> 1442.679
i couldn't i just couldn't accept it

1438.32 --> 1442.6789999999999
back then because i was too haunted

1451.76 --> 1454.32
okay

1457.52 --> 1462.559
yeah i don't need to

1459.52 --> 1464.0
i don't need anybody to channel god for

1462.559 --> 1468.2
me thanks

1464.0 --> 1468.2
can do that all inside

1478.799 --> 1483.1589999999999

show it was pretty heavy

2159.76 --> 2167.0400000000004
qe was like super fired up as well

2164.56 --> 2167.92
like i had to literally just like gui

2167.04 --> 2170.4
stop

2167.92 --> 2173.119
stop yelling through it like you're

2170.4 --> 2175.28
you're ruining the show

2173.119 --> 2178.8
it was just going ballistic he was like

2175.28 --> 2181.0400000000004
ready to strangle bob because it was bob

2178.8 --> 2182.96
kind of doing the same thing as he'd

2181.04 --> 2184.0
done before

2182.96 --> 2187.64
bob the

2184.0 --> 2187.64
science guy

2195.599 --> 2202.079
so yeah that was a very intense show

2198.4 --> 2202.079
with a lot of berating

2202.16 --> 2206.64
do you have to be a member to listen to

2204.72 --> 2208.8799999999997
the after show

2206.64 --> 2208.8799999999997
no

2209.44 --> 2214.64
you do have to be a member or a

2211.359 --> 2216.7999999999997
moderator which i am to be able to watch

2214.64 --> 2218.16
it like the same night

2216.8 --> 2220.32
when it's streamed

2218.16 --> 2222.48
sometimes it doesn't even always do that

2220.32 --> 2224.32
i think i'm not entirely sure

2222.48 --> 2229.04
but like all the after shows the

2224.32 --> 2231.6800000000003
complete shows with pre and after show

2229.04 --> 2234.24
they always as far as i know nathan

2231.68 --> 2237.1189999999997
plays them for everybody

2234.24 --> 2237.1189999999997
two days later

2238.88 --> 2245.04
and if they're really good he sometimes

2240.72 --> 2245.04
plays them again like in the weekend

2246.96 --> 2252.56
or like half a week later anyway

2250.32 --> 2252.56
so

2254.0 --> 2261.72
it should be playing thursday

2257.76 --> 2261.7200000000003
thursday evening somewhere

2275.76 --> 2283.119
using cold plasma

2279.359 --> 2284.64
transformed sustainable i have no idea

2283.119 --> 2287.6400000000003
what you're talking about steamy

2284.64 --> 2287.64
traveler

2300.88 --> 2305.28
members to listen live no that doesn't

2302.56 --> 2308.4
work dusty ryder because it's not being

2305.28 --> 2310.32
streamed live anywhere

2308.4 --> 2313.599
it's only during the live show then as

2310.32 --> 2316.2400000000002
soon as nathan stops that he just

2313.599 --> 2319.2000000000003
records the rest so the only way to

2316.24 --> 2320.7999999999997
actually be present with that is to be

2319.2 --> 2323.5989999999997
on discord

2320.8 --> 2326.2400000000002
that's still gonna be open

2323.599 --> 2327.599
or to go yeah through the google plus

2326.24 --> 2329.359
panel

2327.599 --> 2331.52
where i

2329.359 --> 2331.52
am

2332.88 --> 2337.359
so yeah if you want to

2335.2 --> 2339.359
tune in during that

2337.359 --> 2343.04
during the after show recording then you

2339.359 --> 2343.04
have to be there in the discord

2346.96 --> 2350.56
and then you can listen to it live

2353.52 --> 2358.599
all right anyway let me check out your

2354.96 --> 2358.599
link steemit rather

2387.599 --> 2390.4
oh my god

2392.0 --> 2398.48
oh wow wow that

2394.32 --> 2402.7200000000003
plus must remarkably common most matters

2398.48 --> 2402.72
seem in the known universe

2402.8 --> 2407.44
according to astrophysicist

2405.44 --> 2410.4
is in the plasma state

2407.44 --> 2413.359
oh wow

2410.4 --> 2415.92
how special

2413.359 --> 2419.16
this seems

2415.92 --> 2419.16
kind of ridiculous

2431.2 --> 2436.04
the liverpool one is this

2446.16 --> 2450.3999999999996
apply plasma to seeds

2451.52 --> 2455.52
plasma from normal gases

2456.16 --> 2463.319
i don't understand what is this

2458.88 --> 2463.319
like why what does it do

2478.4 --> 2481.4
what

2482.56 --> 2487.04
okay so this kind of sounds on the

2485.44 --> 2489.839
surface to me

2487.04 --> 2492.88
like they're kind of using plasma to

2489.839 --> 2495.04
electrify the plants

2492.88 --> 2500.0
and apparently under the right

2495.04 --> 2500.0
conditions which is extremely unspecific

2500.319 --> 2504.24
it yields

2501.76 --> 2507.2400000000002
bigger fruits

2504.24 --> 2507.24
okay

2514.88 --> 2519.04
it really does sound it's just like the

2516.8 --> 2522.6400000000003
electrical charging of plants

2519.04 --> 2525.7599999999998
with plasma apparently it's weird

2522.64 --> 2525.7599999999998
i've never heard of this

2528.0 --> 2531.0
hmm

2563.52 --> 2565.839
what

2566.319 --> 2569.2799999999997
that is

2568.0 --> 2571.76
really

2569.28 --> 2576.2000000000003
plasma

2571.76 --> 2576.2000000000003
as an alternative to ammonia

2585.04 --> 2587.839
hey

2585.92 --> 2590.16
i don't know what to say

2587.839 --> 2590.16
this is

2590.88 --> 2595.359
like is that actually more efficient

2596.88 --> 2602.92
it's a medium to deliver to the soil

2599.92 --> 2602.92
okay

2628.079 --> 2631.48
right so

2645.359 --> 2654.2
like i'd like to know more about just

2649.28 --> 2654.2000000000003
it is a pretty big article though man

2685.839 --> 2690.48
like do they

2687.359 --> 2693.119
do they have an explanation as to like

2690.48 --> 2695.04
the chemistry like the plasma like how

2693.119 --> 2697.359
does the plasma

2695.04 --> 2699.68
actually do something

2697.359 --> 2702.72
it's weird because i think like okay

2699.68 --> 2704.56
electrifying perhaps like

2702.72 --> 2706.0789999999997
plasma is like

2704.56 --> 2708.24
charged

2706.079 --> 2711.2400000000002
i think

2708.24 --> 2711.24
but

2725.76 --> 2728.0
well

2730.16 --> 2735.68
right yeah i'm a little like puzzled

2734.16 --> 2737.92
doesn't seem like it

2735.68 --> 2740.24
like it's a bad thing the technological

2737.92 --> 2742.64
development i guess i'm just a little

2740.24 --> 2745.64
weirded out by it like what

2742.64 --> 2745.64
plasma

2790.0 --> 2794.96
reactive species of nitrogen

2796.319 --> 2799.319
wow

2821.68 --> 2824.0789999999997
all right

2826.319 --> 2831.119
yes yeah they still have

2829.119 --> 2834.48
steam traveler it is interesting it's

2831.119 --> 2834.48
just that i don't really know

2835.119 --> 2843.1600000000003
it's like what what is this

2838.16 --> 2843.16
i've never thought of anything like that

2852.0 --> 2857.079
i wonder though how efficient is it

2854.079 --> 2857.079
really

2861.68 --> 2868.5989999999997
is it actually less wasteful

2865.04 --> 2868.599
in the end result

2891.44 --> 2895.359
like

2892.48 --> 2896.4
they say oh it grows bigger

2895.359 --> 2899.52
right

2896.4 --> 2902.079
well that's also what they say said

2899.52 --> 2903.359
originally

2902.079 --> 2905.76
when

2903.359 --> 2908.48
the artificial fertilizer the chemical

2905.76 --> 2910.079
fertilizer was invented it's like oh

2908.48 --> 2913.2
look at it

2910.079 --> 2914.96
massive crops get out of it but

2913.2 --> 2917.2799999999997
it wasn't healthy

2914.96 --> 2920.079
so i wonder if they actually

2917.28 --> 2922.2400000000002
checked that i mean

2920.079 --> 2923.28
okay these plants grow bigger because of

2922.24 --> 2924.4799999999996
that

2923.28 --> 2928.559
but

2924.48 --> 2931.2
do they then also become more healthy

2928.559 --> 2933.8390000000004
you know that's a question that

2931.2 --> 2935.2799999999997
i don't see addressed

2933.839 --> 2939.48
in the article

2935.28 --> 2939.48
like the nutritional value

2942.8 --> 2947.52
it's just like oh look it's bigger

2945.119 --> 2951.2400000000002
that's like the only oh it's bigger but

2947.52 --> 2951.24
is it better though

2959.92 --> 2964.7200000000003
what

2961.839 --> 2964.72
what is it clutch

2965.2 --> 2971.72
holographic

2966.88 --> 2971.7200000000003
partner at the football game what

2991.68 --> 2994.0
oh

2994.319 --> 2999.839
yeah i've seen that before or not this

2996.559 --> 2999.8390000000004
one specifically but

3004.16 --> 3007.7999999999997
this one is cute

3015.839 --> 3020.319
yeah that that's like augmented reality

3021.92 --> 3026.96
so nobody in there is seeing it unless

3024.319 --> 3028.8
you have like a special you'll see it

3026.96 --> 3031.76
through your screen so everybody will be

3028.8 --> 3033.52
like oh looking through my screen at

3031.76 --> 3035.119
that thing out there

3033.52 --> 3036.88
that you can't actually see with your

3035.119 --> 3037.6800000000003
own eyes

3036.88 --> 3041.839
i

3037.68 --> 3041.839
yeah it's more like augmented reality

3051.839 --> 3054.839
huh

3057.04 --> 3060.88
okay

3058.16 --> 3062.7999999999997
dutch scientists

3060.88 --> 3066.88
in uganda

3062.8 --> 3066.88
develop portable reactors

3067.04 --> 3073.72
to generate plasma for fertilizers

3070.319 --> 3073.72
okay interesting

3115.52 --> 3120.24
getting us all ready for the future

3117.68 --> 3121.5989999999997
holographic lie oh that's so dramatic

3120.24 --> 3125.359
again

3121.599 --> 3127.76
it's only gonna be that to those who

3125.359 --> 3130.7999999999997
don't actually go anywhere and only look

3127.76 --> 3132.7200000000003
at everything through screens

3130.8 --> 3133.8390000000004
and they will get to see that and if

3132.72 --> 3136.5589999999997
they then

3133.839 --> 3138.72
start to believe it

3136.559 --> 3141.119
yeah that's pretty stupid

3138.72 --> 3144.48
then you literally are just

3141.119 --> 3146.319
locked in and being programmed

3144.48 --> 3148.48
with delusion but

3146.319 --> 3148.48
like

3149.359 --> 3152.5589999999997
that technology is just that it's

3151.52 --> 3156.319
something

3152.559 --> 3158.4
projected over a real camera view

3156.319 --> 3160.88
of a place and then

3158.4 --> 3162.559
you can see on your screen the hologram

3160.88 --> 3163.92
that's been around for a while by the

3162.559 --> 3164.8390000000004
way

3163.92 --> 3167.52
quite a

3164.839 --> 3171.2799999999997
while like i think that

3167.52 --> 3171.28
probably around for a decade already

3172.319 --> 3178.319
seen others other of these types of

3175.44 --> 3181.04
like stadium animations i think one was

3178.319 --> 3184.64
like with a gorilla and in one there was

3181.04 --> 3187.44
like a whale swimming around above it

3184.64 --> 3187.44
something like that

3188.4 --> 3191.359
so this is definitely not the first one

3190.079 --> 3193.2000000000003
that i've seen

3191.359 --> 3196.88
it's just augmented reality it's just

3193.2 --> 3199.2799999999997
projected over the camera

3196.88 --> 3199.28
that's it

3205.119 --> 3210.0
you've actually seen [ __ ] like that in

3207.2 --> 3213.0
the sky are you sure about that

3210.0 --> 3213.0
agm

3226.24 --> 3229.5589999999997
i haven't

3252.96 --> 3259.119
project bluebeam no project bluebeam is

3256.079 --> 3259.8390000000004
extremely specific

3259.119 --> 3262.1600000000003
but

3259.839 --> 3264.7999999999997
who knows man maybe they have

3262.16 --> 3267.359
kind of like improved and maybe they'll

3264.8 --> 3269.3590000000004
get to perfection soon of actual

3267.359 --> 3272.96
holographic projection where you will

3269.359 --> 3272.96
see a hologram projected

3273.92 --> 3277.92
just like the one

3275.76 --> 3279.599
in back to the future when he goes to

3277.92 --> 3281.44
the future and then he's standing

3279.599 --> 3282.559
somewhere and then suddenly a shark

3281.44 --> 3284.559
comes

3282.559 --> 3285.6800000000003
out of the billboard

3284.559 --> 3287.599
right

3285.68 --> 3292.1189999999997
well that might become

3287.599 --> 3292.119
in the not too distant future reality

3292.24 --> 3297.2799999999997
that might just be

3294.24 --> 3299.52
even pretty casually possible at some

3297.28 --> 3299.52
point

3299.76 --> 3304.7990000000004
right it is the holographic age

3302.72 --> 3307.839
like it was going to happen one way or

3304.799 --> 3307.839
the other

3317.839 --> 3322.72
they probably not they they have the

3320.16 --> 3325.5989999999997
ability it's not probably they have the

3322.72 --> 3326.8799999999997
ability to do that

3325.599 --> 3329.6800000000003
right

3326.88 --> 3333.52
project bluebeam was not something that

3329.68 --> 3337.9199999999996
was going to be developed no it they had

3333.52 --> 3340.4
it they had ways of doing that they just

3337.92 --> 3342.48
didn't engage

3340.4 --> 3344.079
like the original plan

3342.48 --> 3348.28
they have that it's not something they

3344.079 --> 3348.28
have to develop they have it

3361.599 --> 3367.6400000000003
yeah hey jim i

3364.16 --> 3367.64
i'm with you

3376.48 --> 3380.72
nasa's parker solar probe no i haven't

3379.2 --> 3382.319
heard about that

3380.72 --> 3384.9599999999996
touch the sun

3382.319 --> 3389.24
yeah right

3384.96 --> 3389.2400000000002
let me see that approach footage

3392.48 --> 3399.4
not buying that at all it's nonsense

3396.4 --> 3399.4
uh

3433.92 --> 3436.16
all right

3437.76 --> 3442.88
touch it approach it it's all super cute

3440.4 --> 3445.6800000000003
it's just never

3442.88 --> 3447.599
like oh from one location to the other

3445.68 --> 3449.2
let's see some non-stop footage let's

3447.599 --> 3454.1600000000003
see the

3449.2 --> 3454.16
angular size increase as you go live

3454.96 --> 3459.319
yeah they don't show that

3460.319 --> 3465.599
it's more like oh look at the

3462.559 --> 3468.0
vacation snapshots of these couple of

3465.599 --> 3470.799
moments oh look see

3468.0 --> 3472.0
this oh now it's in the you can see the

3470.799 --> 3474.64
curve

3472.0 --> 3477.44
now it's in the orbit

3474.64 --> 3479.2799999999997
oh look now it's supposedly away from

3477.44 --> 3481.52
earth

3479.28 --> 3483.6800000000003
but you don't see life turn around you

3481.52 --> 3485.2
don't see the earth's angular size

3483.68 --> 3487.44
decrease

3485.2 --> 3489.839
live on the long run nothing of that

3487.44 --> 3489.839
never

3494.16 --> 3499.44
yeah pj crew shank i agree

3496.88 --> 3503.2400000000002
this sun is not a giant ball of fire you

3499.44 --> 3503.2400000000002
you can't touch it

3505.599 --> 3509.599
right

3507.76 --> 3511.76
and icarus

3509.599 --> 3515.2400000000002
you know icarus was just a lying little

3511.76 --> 3515.2400000000002
gamma angel

3516.16 --> 3520.799
like he didn't go there he's just

3518.4 --> 3522.64
regular i'm gonna go to the sun kind of

3520.799 --> 3523.599
like oh we're gonna go gonna go to the

3522.64 --> 3525.2
moon

3523.599 --> 3526.559
but he's in angels and like i am gonna

3525.2 --> 3529.7599999999998
go to the sun

3526.559 --> 3531.2000000000003
and then like yeah he just flies around

3529.76 --> 3533.119
after the sun

3531.2 --> 3534.799
all day and night never approaching it

3533.119 --> 3537.119
always out of reach and then it's just

3534.799 --> 3538.72
like ah screw it i gotta freaking tell

3537.119 --> 3541.44
them after all this effort that i

3538.72 --> 3545.64
actually went to the sun

3541.44 --> 3545.64
i'm just gonna burn my wings

3546.319 --> 3551.2
and just say that they melted because i

3549.28 --> 3552.96
went too close to the sun

3551.2 --> 3554.64
you know that's what happened because

3552.96 --> 3557.2
the sun is holographic and you can

3554.64 --> 3557.2
approach it

3557.359 --> 3564.68
so yeah icarus just lied

3560.64 --> 3564.68
this is a little gamma angel

3580.64 --> 3582.96
all right

3583.76 --> 3588.48
like was he even an angel like what kind

3585.68 --> 3591.1189999999997
of an angel has wax wings sounds like he

3588.48 --> 3594.319
was pretending to be an angel instead

3591.119 --> 3594.319
but yeah who might just say

3596.88 --> 3600.44
i wasn't there

3608.35 --> 3611.5499999999997
[Music]

3611.599 --> 3615.3590000000004
right because it's the ultimate gamma

3613.599 --> 3617.28
move to do that

3615.359 --> 3618.0789999999997
start bragging you can do something

3617.28 --> 3620.48
that's

3618.079 --> 3624.319
thought of as impossible

3620.48 --> 3627.599
and then literally victimize yourself

3624.319 --> 3629.04
to achieve virtual victory there's no

3627.599 --> 3634.28
more gamma

3629.04 --> 3634.2799999999997
that's maximum it's maximum gamma action

3659.839 --> 3662.839
so

3674.72 --> 3680.0
feminist

3677.2 --> 3684.68
space balloon what does what are you

3680.0 --> 3684.68
talking about dusty writer what

3697.599 --> 3701.0
hello cleary

3726.24 --> 3731.24
right i'm gonna take two minute break

3727.76 --> 3731.2400000000002
i'll be right back

3774.16 --> 3777.16
so

3789.119 --> 3792.119
so

3832.72 --> 3836.359
and i'm back

3852.96 --> 3858.079
yep rob h welcome by the way but yeah

3856.16 --> 3858.8799999999997
when you start to really think about it

3858.079 --> 3860.88
what

3858.88 --> 3863.359
what the globe claims and all that

3860.88 --> 3865.599
actually entail

3863.359 --> 3869.0389999999998
yeah it does sound ridiculous when you

3865.599 --> 3871.839
say it like that heat from the sun

3869.039 --> 3874.4
traveling 93 million miles through a

3871.839 --> 3874.4
vacuum

3879.68 --> 3881.839
just

3882.319 --> 3887.44
mostly just light in general traveling

3885.68 --> 3890.0
that kind of a distance

3887.44 --> 3892.319
entirely

3890.0 --> 3895.839
is kind of insane considering the

3892.319 --> 3895.839
inverse square law

3896.0 --> 3899.92
like

3897.52 --> 3901.7599999999998
in a way it is truly insane because if

3899.92 --> 3904.0
you realize that

3901.76 --> 3907.92
it would have to be so strong as to be

3904.0 --> 3911.2
as bright as we perceive it on earth

3907.92 --> 3914.48
that like if you get any closer to that

3911.2 --> 3916.3999999999996
it's going to be so absurdly blinding

3914.48 --> 3919.44
like you can't see anything you know how

3916.4 --> 3921.039
could you see space

3919.44 --> 3923.2000000000003
when there's a light that freaking

3921.039 --> 3926.4
bright everywhere

3923.2 --> 3928.96
and the only thing that could even

3926.4 --> 3931.599
make you see the star heaven would be

3928.96 --> 3933.68
some planet blocking out the sun so you

3931.599 --> 3936.1600000000003
could see that because it would have to

3933.68 --> 3938.64
be so insanely bright there's literally

3936.16 --> 3941.0389999999998
nothing else you could see

3938.64 --> 3944.5589999999997
if you got any closer

3941.039 --> 3944.559
it's preposterous

3949.44 --> 3953.119
and then also like yeah how does that

3951.44 --> 3955.76
infrasquare law

3953.119 --> 3960.0
even apply to

3955.76 --> 3962.96
planets supposedly further down the ring

3960.0 --> 3965.68
further down the milky way i mean

3962.96 --> 3969.039
the solar system

3965.68 --> 3970.319
they are effectively reflecting sunlight

3969.039 --> 3971.6800000000003
all the way

3970.319 --> 3973.599
back here

3971.68 --> 3975.2799999999997
how does that work out with inverse

3973.599 --> 3977.2000000000003
square law

3975.28 --> 3978.48
it's just

3977.2 --> 3980.96
are like

3978.48 --> 3983.44
i wonder sometimes if they have just

3980.96 --> 3985.2
completely discarded

3983.44 --> 3988.48
the knowledge of infrasquare law of

3985.2 --> 3989.9199999999996
light in the entire solar system set up

3988.48 --> 3992.0
like they are ex

3989.92 --> 3996.48
they're like pretending like through a

3992.0 --> 3998.88
vacuum there is no limit to its strength

3996.48 --> 4001.92
that it only decreases because of

3998.88 --> 4005.88
absorption by atmosphere

4001.92 --> 4005.88
something like that it's

4007.599 --> 4010.7200000000003
it's quite surreal

4011.28 --> 4014.96
when you really start to think about it

4017.359 --> 4021.24
it's fear monger

4031.599 --> 4037.119
is it within or beyond firmament

4034.799 --> 4039.2
it is

4037.119 --> 4042.799
in the material realm if there is a

4039.2 --> 4045.2799999999997
location where you can see the sunlight

4042.799 --> 4047.28
that is where the sunlight is

4045.28 --> 4049.599
the sunlight is only where you can see

4047.28 --> 4050.48
it

4049.599 --> 4053.119
and i

4050.48 --> 4055.2
i'm pretty convinced it is within

4053.119 --> 4058.48
within the container only

4055.2 --> 4060.0
because if you go up way high

4058.48 --> 4063.48
where is it then

4060.0 --> 4063.48
where does it go

4076.64 --> 4081.359
right stars disappearing when you go up

4079.28 --> 4083.599
really high all that

4081.359 --> 4086.0
like oh the sky is black but there's no

4083.599 --> 4088.1600000000003
stars that makes no freaking sense at

4086.0 --> 4088.16
all

4089.2 --> 4092.5589999999997
right

4090.559 --> 4095.599
so wherever the light the celestial

4092.559 --> 4097.359
light is manifesting from and how it is

4095.599 --> 4098.4800000000005
within the realm it seems to be the

4097.359 --> 4100.400000000001
condition

4098.48 --> 4103.678999999999
right the only way to even see the globe

4100.4 --> 4104.48
of the heavens is to be in a specific

4103.679 --> 4106.799
zone

4104.48 --> 4110.639999999999
where that holographics those

4106.799 --> 4112.56
holographics manifest to the observer

4110.64 --> 4117.08
and that is in the realm

4112.56 --> 4117.080000000001
so i hope that answers the question

4122.48 --> 4129.48
hello ben white

4124.799 --> 4129.48
special pleading fallacy for what

4136.719 --> 4140.319
right but

4138.08 --> 4142.239
technically steamy traveler the question

4140.319 --> 4145.6
where does the holographic light

4142.239 --> 4146.879999999999
originate from is kind of a

4145.6 --> 4147.839
a mistake

4146.88 --> 4149.04
because

4147.839 --> 4150.48
when you say

4149.04 --> 4152.719
coming from

4150.48 --> 4153.839
suggests

4152.719 --> 4156.08
actual

4153.839 --> 4158.64
euclidean travel

4156.08 --> 4158.64
in a way

4159.44 --> 4163.5199999999995
it doesn't

4160.88 --> 4167.04
it manifests it's there

4163.52 --> 4167.040000000001
in relation to the observer

4167.199 --> 4172.239
so when it's not there in relation to

4169.359 --> 4174.2390000000005
the observer then that is a region where

4172.239 --> 4177.5599999999995
the light no longer is where it no

4174.239 --> 4177.5599999999995
longer manifests

4200.32 --> 4203.639999999999
right anymore

4206.8 --> 4209.89
[Music]

4224.08 --> 4227.76
okay

4225.6 --> 4230.8
special pleading fallacy for what

4227.76 --> 4233.4400000000005
happens in a vacuum

4230.8 --> 4233.4400000000005
what do you mean

4234.0 --> 4237.84
you mean

4234.96 --> 4237.84
when i mentioned

4238.88 --> 4246.4800000000005
how does the inverse square law of light

4241.84 --> 4246.4800000000005
work in a vacuum yeah

4247.92 --> 4251.4400000000005
i guess that is a special pleading

4249.52 --> 4253.4400000000005
fallacy because that's not a natural

4251.44 --> 4256.5599999999995
occurrence

4253.44 --> 4258.879999999999
like we cannot draw vacuum in the realm

4256.56 --> 4261.76
in order to test even

4258.88 --> 4263.679
what the celestial lights do

4261.76 --> 4265.04
when there is no air it might be it's

4263.679 --> 4267.52
all gone

4265.04 --> 4269.76
it might the atmosphere might simply be

4267.52 --> 4273.56
the condition for the holographic

4269.76 --> 4273.56
celestial light manifestation

4275.92 --> 4279.36
right

4276.719 --> 4282.08
certainly a correlatory conclusion you

4279.36 --> 4284.239
could draw based on oh you go up higher

4282.08 --> 4287.76
much much higher oh guess what

4284.239 --> 4290.239
get the blue earth

4287.76 --> 4293.360000000001
with like daylight down there a band and

4290.239 --> 4295.678999999999
then above it it's just black

4293.36 --> 4298.96
but no stars that makes no freaking

4295.679 --> 4301.28
sense at all like at all no excuses it

4298.96 --> 4303.52
doesn't make any sense

4301.28 --> 4305.759999999999
if any of that any of these lights are

4303.52 --> 4307.76
supposedly euclidean

4305.76 --> 4310.2390000000005
why don't you see them anymore when you

4307.76 --> 4312.88
go high up

4310.239 --> 4314.48
all the excuses i've heard

4312.88 --> 4315.76
are just

4314.48 --> 4319.199
not

4315.76 --> 4321.52
logically consistent with how light

4319.199 --> 4323.28
originating from a euclidean position

4321.52 --> 4325.76
should be behaving

4323.28 --> 4327.04
at all like a complete fabrication

4325.76 --> 4329.52
response

4327.04 --> 4331.04
we'd actually kind of more suggest like

4329.52 --> 4332.96
they're addressing the actual

4331.04 --> 4334.64
holographic nature of it

4332.96 --> 4337.84
and then pretending they're talking

4334.64 --> 4339.280000000001
about their heliocentric modeling

4337.84 --> 4341.360000000001
because it just doesn't make any

4339.28 --> 4343.28
mechanical sense those claims the

4341.36 --> 4347.12
justifications why you don't see that

4343.28 --> 4347.12
anymore that i've heard in the past

4351.52 --> 4357.2390000000005
all right see you later pj crew shank

4353.52 --> 4357.2390000000005
thanks for popping by

4379.44 --> 4384.48
what's the difference between visible

4381.44 --> 4386.96
light we see from the apparent sun

4384.48 --> 4390.718999999999
and the heat we can feel

4386.96 --> 4390.719
that seems to come from the sun

4391.44 --> 4395.759999999999
it's another spectrum of the holographic

4393.92 --> 4398.159
light manifestation i think that the

4395.76 --> 4401.04
sun's heat is just as much holographic

4398.159 --> 4401.04
as its light

4408.88 --> 4415.679
right the whole output of it

4413.12 --> 4418.0
seems all holographic to me

4415.679 --> 4418.96
it has to be it can't be

4418.0 --> 4421.6
oh

4418.96 --> 4422.96
the light part the visible spectrum

4421.6 --> 4425.360000000001
thing we see

4422.96 --> 4427.12
is holographic and like oh this person

4425.36 --> 4428.96
has a light ray right in front of his

4427.12 --> 4431.44
feet somebody else looks at the person

4428.96 --> 4433.6
from a fast distance and they do not see

4431.44 --> 4435.44
the light ray in front of their feet

4433.6 --> 4437.679
like the first person

4435.44 --> 4440.4
right well if that's the case there is

4437.679 --> 4443.36
no way

4440.4 --> 4444.639999999999
that something else another element

4443.36 --> 4447.04
would not

4444.64 --> 4448.88
do that

4447.04 --> 4451.44
there's no way that would make any that

4448.88 --> 4453.52
means there would be a heat sun that is

4451.44 --> 4457.879999999999
invisible and that behaves differently

4453.52 --> 4457.88
than the holographic light sun

4468.159 --> 4473.04
gadget inspector

4469.679 --> 4473.04
tasmanian truther

4473.6 --> 4476.56
getting a lot of interesting new people

4475.52 --> 4480.040000000001
in chat

4476.56 --> 4480.04
it's good to see

4518.159 --> 4521.159
uh

4527.84 --> 4533.84
how would you be able to see stars when

4530.719 --> 4535.76
that close to something as bright lit as

4533.84 --> 4538.96
the earth

4535.76 --> 4542.0
that makes no sense if the skies are

4538.96 --> 4543.04
black visibly black and beneath you you

4542.0 --> 4545.28
see

4543.04 --> 4547.199
like on the downside you see like the

4545.28 --> 4549.28
blue earth

4547.199 --> 4552.719
with like a layer of admin that's what

4549.28 --> 4555.759999999999
it looks like it's like a blue layer

4552.719 --> 4557.28
but it's black up there

4555.76 --> 4559.280000000001
how

4557.28 --> 4564.08
does that make sense that you don't see

4559.28 --> 4564.08
stars in the black up there

4564.32 --> 4567.639999999999
it's black

4574.32 --> 4579.92
right so it's not close enough it's

4576.56 --> 4581.92
it's distant enough that you see black

4579.92 --> 4584.2390000000005
up there how can you not see stars

4581.92 --> 4587.6
through that and like any stars it's not

4584.239 --> 4590.159
like oh yeah oh there oh that very very

4587.6 --> 4591.04
bright star and that one yeah we can see

4590.159 --> 4593.36
that

4591.04 --> 4596.96
but the rest no it's all no it's just

4593.36 --> 4599.839999999999
nothing nothing no stars nothing

4596.96 --> 4600.88
absolutely nothing when there is

4599.84 --> 4604.159000000001
less

4600.88 --> 4607.12
material in between

4604.159 --> 4610.5599999999995
your position there high up

4607.12 --> 4613.5199999999995
and the supposed stars

4610.56 --> 4615.6
at all these vast distances there's less

4613.52 --> 4618.320000000001
obstruction there should be

4615.6 --> 4620.320000000001
less absorption of the light traveling

4618.32 --> 4623.32
the distance so it doesn't make any

4620.32 --> 4623.32
sense

4626.239 --> 4632.0
you can see serious during the day oh

4629.04 --> 4635.44
i'm sure you can but can you see it when

4632.0 --> 4638.239
you go way up there and you see the

4635.44 --> 4640.719
bluish earth beneath you and black above

4638.239 --> 4642.718999999999
you i don't think so i don't think you

4640.719 --> 4644.719
see any stars

4642.719 --> 4646.96
like even with the

4644.719 --> 4648.96
parts of the footage of supposed rocket

4646.96 --> 4650.96
launches when they go up there and then

4648.96 --> 4655.52
fisheye land shows you like oh the earth

4650.96 --> 4656.64
is curved yeah in those shots you never

4655.52 --> 4658.4800000000005
ever

4656.64 --> 4661.4400000000005
see stars

4658.48 --> 4663.839999999999
in the black part of the footage in

4661.44 --> 4666.48
opposition to the blue part that is

4663.84 --> 4668.32
earth you never see any stars in

4666.48 --> 4669.5199999999995
actual rocket

4668.32 --> 4672.0
footage

4669.52 --> 4674.96
anybody ever notice that

4672.0 --> 4676.4
no stars in those footage

4674.96 --> 4678.96
kind of just

4676.4 --> 4681.12
looked past it for decades and decades

4678.96 --> 4683.52
you don't see any stars in rocket launch

4681.12 --> 4683.5199999999995
footage

4702.64 --> 4707.679
right so

4703.76 --> 4710.320000000001
how would you not be able to see stars

4707.679 --> 4713.92
when that close to something

4710.32 --> 4716.32
or rather that distant from something as

4713.92 --> 4718.4800000000005
bright lit as the earth

4716.32 --> 4722.32
it's so distant actually that like the

4718.48 --> 4723.5199999999995
entire top half of the site

4722.32 --> 4726.639999999999
is black

4723.52 --> 4728.96
how can you not see stars in all that

4726.64 --> 4728.96
black

4729.28 --> 4733.84
it's not being out shown it's not like

4731.12 --> 4736.32
that blue is just

4733.84 --> 4738.400000000001
all the way up there and it's still okay

4736.32 --> 4739.92
like dark blue no it's

4738.4 --> 4740.96
blue down there

4739.92 --> 4744.4800000000005
black

4740.96 --> 4748.199
just black pitch black ink black

4744.48 --> 4748.199
no stars nothing

4751.52 --> 4755.4400000000005
so can we see stars yeah

4754.0 --> 4758.719
here down here

4755.44 --> 4763.08
down here on the earth at night

4758.719 --> 4763.08
that's where you see stars up there

4763.12 --> 4765.599999999999
down here

4772.08 --> 4779.76
so why do we seize bright stars in dark

4775.199 --> 4782.719
areas on earth and not in a city

4779.76 --> 4784.4800000000005
because there there is actually no

4782.719 --> 4786.719
bright black

4784.48 --> 4787.839999999999
right because literally there is light

4786.719 --> 4790.4800000000005
pollution

4787.84 --> 4792.96
from down here

4790.48 --> 4794.879999999999
blurring up like inserting light then

4792.96 --> 4797.6
you don't see it anymore

4794.88 --> 4799.28
yeah but when you go up

4797.6 --> 4802.4800000000005
very high up

4799.28 --> 4805.679
there is none of that light pollution

4802.48 --> 4809.4
above you it's black pitch black

4805.679 --> 4809.4
there's no light pollution

4830.159 --> 4833.159
hmm

4833.199 --> 4837.5199999999995
hey tara 306 dutch sailor

4839.28 --> 4844.599999999999
so yeah got any response to that cps

4846.96 --> 4854.159
when you say bright black when i say

4849.52 --> 4854.159000000001
bright black i mean deep black sorry

4857.52 --> 4861.8
it's like blindingly black

4863.6 --> 4868.1990000000005
yeah bright black sounds kind of silly

4875.679 --> 4879.96
thanks for the correction by the way

4885.7 --> 4889.099999999999
[Music]

4907.36 --> 4914.48
really long x that's [ __ ] cbs

4911.36 --> 4914.48
that's [ __ ]

4914.639 --> 4919.36
like that is

4916.719 --> 4919.36
terrible

4920.08 --> 4924.8
are you serious no you don't need long

4922.88 --> 4926.8
exposure times

4924.8 --> 4930.8
to see the stars

4926.8 --> 4933.28
you can open your eyes at night

4930.8 --> 4935.84
in the city area where there's not a lot

4933.28 --> 4938.8
of shine right in this city i can have

4935.84 --> 4942.719
pretty damn clear skies right it's not

4938.8 --> 4944.4800000000005
pristine diamond radiant stars

4942.719 --> 4946.88
but it's still bright enough that i can

4944.48 --> 4949.12
even see the little stars yeah

4946.88 --> 4951.12
that's not because i keep staring at the

4949.12 --> 4954.4
black and then suddenly see them again

4951.12 --> 4956.639
and the camera pretty sure that my p900

4954.4 --> 4959.36
will be able to see them just as fine as

4956.639 --> 4964.400000000001
my eyes can right

4959.36 --> 4964.4
so that's absolute nonsense to say that

4964.639 --> 4970.400000000001
if a camera on earth during night can

4967.679 --> 4973.36
pick up stars in an instant

4970.4 --> 4976.48
then so should they be able to

4973.36 --> 4980.08
way up there when half

4976.48 --> 4982.799999999999
the view is completely pitch black

4980.08 --> 4985.28
it's it's nonsense if you can see it

4982.8 --> 4988.400000000001
down here then you should be able to see

4985.28 --> 4993.32
it up there in a pitch black

4988.4 --> 4993.32
makes no sense to suggest anything else

5001.44 --> 5006.239
you've never studied photography oh you

5003.44 --> 5007.36
mean the literal example that i just

5006.239 --> 5009.919999999999
gave

5007.36 --> 5012.96
the literal example yeah if a camera can

5009.92 --> 5015.6
instantly pick up stars at night right

5012.96 --> 5018.159
here

5015.6 --> 5020.96
right here

5018.159 --> 5024.239
then why can't it pick up stars way up

5020.96 --> 5029.2390000000005
there instantly when half the sky is

5024.239 --> 5029.239
pitch black makes no sense

5031.76 --> 5034.88
it's right for yourself why is it a

5033.28 --> 5036.5599999999995
wrong example

5034.88 --> 5040.12
what's wrong about it

5036.56 --> 5040.120000000001
isn't it true

5050.32 --> 5053.92
i mean even

5051.84 --> 5056.400000000001
during the morning glory before the sun

5053.92 --> 5057.84
comes up and there's still quite a bit

5056.4 --> 5060.239
of bright light

5057.84 --> 5062.2390000000005
at the horizon

5060.239 --> 5064.0
you could say like oh yeah two-thirds of

5062.239 --> 5067.12
the sky is still pitch black and

5064.0 --> 5069.28
one-third is kind of light

5067.12 --> 5071.12
you can still see stars

5069.28 --> 5074.239
you can still see venus a lot of the

5071.12 --> 5076.8
times very bright yeah yeah can still

5074.239 --> 5079.04
see that so what's the excuse in a

5076.8 --> 5082.159000000001
partially non-black

5079.04 --> 5084.239
and big partially black sky where you

5082.159 --> 5086.4
can see stars with the naked eye

5084.239 --> 5089.04
instantly you don't have to open the

5086.4 --> 5092.48
shutter to see it

5089.04 --> 5096.04
by exposure no that's nonsense that's

5092.48 --> 5096.04
absolute horseshit

5105.12 --> 5108.4
that's cool moon shadow

5109.28 --> 5113.239
i know it's all very pretty

5154.56 --> 5159.120000000001
is it just me getting buffering nope

5160.56 --> 5167.400000000001
but i don't see any buffering

5163.28 --> 5167.4
but i was holding still

5170.88 --> 5177.36
when i focus i sometimes can

5173.199 --> 5177.36
appear a little bit like a human statue

5181.28 --> 5187.199
pretty bad internet there okay

5184.96 --> 5189.12
now my internet for change is finally

5187.199 --> 5191.04
doing fine

5189.12 --> 5193.28
my video is not constantly lagging

5191.04 --> 5195.12
behind on youtube

5193.28 --> 5200.199
because that does happen often it's very

5195.12 --> 5200.199
annoying to scroll forward constantly

5215.17 --> 5219.88
[Music]

5216.88 --> 5219.88
so

5237.92 --> 5242.719
right so yeah you got any take backs

5240.639 --> 5245.28
there cps

5242.719 --> 5246.96
it's basic photography which you haven't

5245.28 --> 5249.5199999999995
studied how do you know i haven't

5246.96 --> 5249.52
studied that

5249.84 --> 5255.4400000000005
how do you know that

5252.56 --> 5257.280000000001
i mean i don't know the maths

5255.44 --> 5259.678999999999
for it

5257.28 --> 5261.44
but i have actually done quite some

5259.679 --> 5263.1990000000005
study when it comes to taking

5261.44 --> 5264.96
photographs

5263.199 --> 5267.599999999999
i did that for a while

5264.96 --> 5269.28
and i did know about opening the shutter

5267.6 --> 5271.04
and

5269.28 --> 5273.28
all the types of pictures you can get

5271.04 --> 5275.6
from that

5273.28 --> 5278.96
i actually even did black and white

5275.6 --> 5281.4400000000005
photography for a while very interesting

5278.96 --> 5285.52
because of what i said oh yeah yeah but

5281.44 --> 5291.44
i actually gave real world examples of

5285.52 --> 5291.4400000000005
that yeah i gave real world examples

5292.0 --> 5296.639
doesn't really have anything to do with

5293.92 --> 5299.28
understanding it's just like hey

5296.639 --> 5301.6
here's an example of a moment where this

5299.28 --> 5304.239
is the case how do you

5301.6 --> 5305.76
justify that

5304.239 --> 5309.44
you don't

5305.76 --> 5310.719
if you can see stars in the black part

5309.44 --> 5313.44
of the sky

5310.719 --> 5316.08
during the dawn when the morning glory

5313.44 --> 5317.599999999999
is at the horizon for quite a while but

5316.08 --> 5319.76
no sun

5317.6 --> 5324.719
then why wouldn't you be able to see

5319.76 --> 5326.96
stars in the black part of the sky

5324.719 --> 5329.36
when you go way up there it makes no

5326.96 --> 5332.0
sense

5329.36 --> 5334.0
like the the suggestion of the

5332.0 --> 5336.0
heliocentric model and what star

5334.0 --> 5340.4
supposedly are and how light supposedly

5336.0 --> 5340.4
functions in accordance makes no sense

5345.44 --> 5350.36
oh you're going to talk to me about

5346.719 --> 5350.36
exposure again

5350.96 --> 5355.679
why

5352.639 --> 5355.679
why would i do that

5356.48 --> 5361.12
i know how that works you open up the

5358.48 --> 5363.44
camera more light gets in more

5361.12 --> 5366.719
it piles up it becomes brighter you get

5363.44 --> 5368.4
to see more details if you're very still

5366.719 --> 5371.04
and the thing you're photographing is

5368.4 --> 5373.04
not moving yeah i know how that works i

5371.04 --> 5376.239
do know how that works you might want to

5373.04 --> 5376.239
stop insulting me

5377.679 --> 5382.4800000000005
yeah

5379.04 --> 5385.44
i know how exposure works i know what

5382.48 --> 5386.718999999999
telescopes are suggested to do

5385.44 --> 5388.96
a lot of them

5386.719 --> 5391.199
to get these super far distant

5388.96 --> 5393.84
photographs supposedly and the theory

5391.199 --> 5393.839999999999
behind that

5394.4 --> 5397.12
yeah

5395.44 --> 5399.839999999999
but

5397.12 --> 5402.159
despite all that

5399.84 --> 5405.1990000000005
despite all that

5402.159 --> 5406.719
in the morning glory time of the day

5405.199 --> 5409.5199999999995
there is a

5406.719 --> 5413.199
pretty big chunk of black sky

5409.52 --> 5416.639
and you see stars in that pretty blick

5413.199 --> 5416.638999999999
black chunk of sky

5416.88 --> 5420.400000000001
you see stars in the big

5419.52 --> 5421.360000000001
black

5420.4 --> 5424.719
sky

5421.36 --> 5426.239
versus the part of the sky

5424.719 --> 5427.92
where it's not black because there's

5426.239 --> 5431.12
morning glory there and sometimes you

5427.92 --> 5432.4
can even see star light through

5431.12 --> 5434.639
that

5432.4 --> 5438.159
doesn't even have to be pitch black to

5434.639 --> 5440.56
see stars sometimes all depends

5438.159 --> 5444.719
definitely can just see venus like right

5440.56 --> 5444.719
through it no problem whatsoever

5444.96 --> 5445.76
so

5445.22 --> 5447.52
[Applause]

5445.76 --> 5451.1990000000005
[Music]

5447.52 --> 5453.52
if that is a fact

5451.199 --> 5456.239
everything i just described anybody in

5453.52 --> 5459.040000000001
the morning could witness that could

5456.239 --> 5461.919999999999
photograph that could film it to prove

5459.04 --> 5462.96
that that is real you see the stars in a

5461.92 --> 5464.88
big

5462.96 --> 5466.4
chunk of the sky that is completely

5464.88 --> 5468.88
black

5466.4 --> 5472.4
when there is a non-black part of the

5468.88 --> 5474.4800000000005
sky right next to it the morning glory

5472.4 --> 5476.799999999999
yeah you see the stars in the black part

5474.48 --> 5480.239
of the sky why don't you see them

5476.8 --> 5482.56
above you in the big chunk of black sky

5480.239 --> 5485.199
when only beneath you do you see some

5482.56 --> 5488.84
blue from the earth it makes no sense

5485.199 --> 5492.159
there's no logical consistence in this

5488.84 --> 5494.88
yeah you have no excuse for that

5492.159 --> 5496.96
aperture keep the camera open it's all

5494.88 --> 5500.4800000000005
[ __ ] you don't need to keep the

5496.96 --> 5503.12
camera open the sea stars in the morning

5500.48 --> 5506.718999999999
black sky when the morning glory takes

5503.12 --> 5509.44
only a third of the sky

5506.719 --> 5511.52
you you don't have to open the shutter

5509.44 --> 5513.36
to see it it's right there you can see

5511.52 --> 5515.84
it instantly you can photograph it

5513.36 --> 5518.5599999999995
instantly you don't need to open

5515.84 --> 5521.1990000000005
anything to get something it's right

5518.56 --> 5524.4800000000005
there in the black of sky

5521.199 --> 5527.28
when there is a non black sky

5524.48 --> 5529.12
right next to it

5527.28 --> 5531.5199999999995
why don't you address that

5529.12 --> 5534.159
you still don't get it

5531.52 --> 5536.0
yeah you're out oh yeah you are out

5534.159 --> 5538.48
you're timed out because you're talking

5536.0 --> 5541.8
[ __ ] you're not addressing what i'm

5538.48 --> 5541.799999999999
talking about

5552.159 --> 5556.5599999999995
next time address the argument

5557.76 --> 5563.84
you don't need to open the shutter to

5561.28 --> 5567.04
get to see something you can just look

5563.84 --> 5568.88
at it in the morning

5567.04 --> 5570.639
in the black sky and it's right there

5568.88 --> 5573.1990000000005
instantly you don't have to open up

5570.639 --> 5576.2390000000005
anything to see anything

5573.199 --> 5579.879999999999
yeah it's right there

5576.239 --> 5579.879999999999
so there's no excuse

5599.199 --> 5603.839999999999
yeah ben white

5600.639 --> 5603.84
so i've heard

5614.0 --> 5618.239
and it is interesting you know ben white

5615.92 --> 5618.2390000000005
because

5618.32 --> 5620.639
maybe

5622.4 --> 5626.879999999999
there are

5623.679 --> 5628.719
unique sites that you just cannot pick

5626.88 --> 5630.8
up with the naked eye

5628.719 --> 5633.44
but it's it's just a different

5630.8 --> 5636.56
holographic pattern if that's the case

5633.44 --> 5638.879999999999
maybe there are like galactic

5636.56 --> 5640.719
fractal lights

5638.88 --> 5643.28
that you get to see when you open the

5640.719 --> 5644.639
shutter for a very long time up there

5643.28 --> 5646.88
right

5644.639 --> 5648.96
i'm not denying that that might be a

5646.88 --> 5650.56
thing that's actually real

5648.96 --> 5652.719
like oh yeah you don't see anything

5650.56 --> 5654.88
unless you like open a shutter and then

5652.719 --> 5657.44
suddenly like little light

5654.88 --> 5659.6
galaxy patterns start forming who knows

5657.44 --> 5661.36
i don't know if that is absolutely

5659.6 --> 5664.159000000001
certain that that happens and i'm not

5661.36 --> 5666.4
excluding it from being possible what i

5664.159 --> 5670.32
am excluding however

5666.4 --> 5672.159
is that that justifies the sightings it

5670.32 --> 5674.639
makes no freaking sense because you

5672.159 --> 5676.08
don't need to do that here on earth to

5674.639 --> 5677.92
see stars

5676.08 --> 5679.36
when it's a black sky

5677.92 --> 5682.639
yeah

5679.36 --> 5684.4
what that means the sofia

5682.639 --> 5686.719
plain

5684.4 --> 5689.839999999999
doing the hubble telescope footage what

5686.719 --> 5692.96
it means is there is another holographic

5689.84 --> 5692.96
mystery up there

5693.679 --> 5698.4
that's interesting it doesn't prove any

5696.719 --> 5701.04
assertion made

5698.4 --> 5702.96
to support the heliocentric model it

5701.04 --> 5706.0
doesn't do that at all it makes no

5702.96 --> 5708.88
freaking logical sense

5706.0 --> 5712.28
in that model at all

5708.88 --> 5712.28
it's not consistent

5720.48 --> 5723.48
hmm

5741.52 --> 5746.159000000001
yeah orbiting or or biting

5747.199 --> 5752.799999999999
isn't that just funny

5749.84 --> 5752.8
is it or

5753.52 --> 5758.0
or a bitting

5756.719 --> 5761.0
or

5758.0 --> 5761.0
biting

5770.4 --> 5773.839999999999
stop

5771.6 --> 5775.92
top strewn

5773.84 --> 5779.1990000000005
tough stream that's okay thanks charles

5775.92 --> 5779.1990000000005
steveson i appreciate that

5780.32 --> 5784.04
maybe it's a little scattered

5784.08 --> 5787.36
but we've treated some interesting

5785.6 --> 5789.679
subjects here at least you know the

5787.36 --> 5792.799999999999
holographic nature of the celestial

5789.679 --> 5794.639
lights are incredibly complicated and

5792.8 --> 5796.84
surreal

5794.639 --> 5799.36
and a lot of assertions have been made

5796.84 --> 5801.92
about how they're supposed to work that

5799.36 --> 5804.159
don't actually

5801.92 --> 5805.92
make any sense

5804.159 --> 5809.719
when it comes to the heliocentric

5805.92 --> 5809.719
conception of it

5814.8 --> 5820.0
[ __ ] bit oh my god

5817.6 --> 5824.280000000001
dusty ryder

5820.0 --> 5824.28
we got another horror pun

5826.99 --> 5832.119
[Music]

5829.119 --> 5832.119
it's

5867.04 --> 5871.84
yeah

5869.119 --> 5873.92
yeah satellites

5871.84 --> 5877.119000000001
satellites are just a very popular

5873.92 --> 5877.119
sci-fi construct

5877.6 --> 5881.360000000001
and it's really easy to use you just

5879.52 --> 5883.92
have to like

5881.36 --> 5885.839999999999
draw some thingy with some solar panels

5883.92 --> 5888.08
and it just instantly everybody will

5885.84 --> 5890.88
recognize oh that's a satellite well

5888.08 --> 5892.8
because what does a satellite need

5890.88 --> 5896.2390000000005
just a box

5892.8 --> 5898.56
solar panels and maybe a radar dish like

5896.239 --> 5902.4
a receiver dish

5898.56 --> 5905.4400000000005
like it doesn't matter how lame it looks

5902.4 --> 5908.239
once that is presented in that fashion

5905.44 --> 5910.96
everybody would at first look

5908.239 --> 5912.5599999999995
immediately recognize that's supposed to

5910.96 --> 5915.84
represent a cell

5912.56 --> 5919.6
that's supposed to represent a satellite

5915.84 --> 5919.6
because it's really ingrained in there

5922.159 --> 5926.08
like it's a

5923.44 --> 5929.759999999999
it's a pop culture construct

5926.08 --> 5929.76
based on sci-fi

5936.88 --> 5941.119
yeah but of course it's not possible

5938.719 --> 5943.119
it's illogical and there is no freaking

5941.119 --> 5946.32
satellites up there especially not in

5943.119 --> 5948.159
the amounts suggested it's ridiculous

5946.32 --> 5951.599999999999
and

5948.159 --> 5954.32
like impossible to have if everything

5951.6 --> 5957.119000000001
was real then it's absolutely

5954.32 --> 5959.04
idiotic to suggest that it wouldn't have

5957.119 --> 5960.159
turned into a giant

5959.04 --> 5961.84
crash

5960.159 --> 5962.638999999999
trash heap

5961.84 --> 5965.28
with

5962.639 --> 5967.04
shards of satellites literally exploding

5965.28 --> 5969.599999999999
in all directions

5967.04 --> 5973.199
and it was even envisioned

5969.6 --> 5975.52
and when i say that i mean way back was

5973.199 --> 5977.839999999999
like 50 years ago there was already

5975.52 --> 5980.639
envisioned like oh the dangers of

5977.84 --> 5982.719
satellite storm and then suddenly

5980.639 --> 5984.719
there's like this storm of shard

5982.719 --> 5986.32
exploded satellites that just start

5984.719 --> 5988.96
orbiting the earth and they're nothing

5986.32 --> 5991.679
you can't get out of it anymore and

5988.96 --> 5994.4
yeah there's even animations of that

5991.679 --> 5996.719
because that would happen

5994.4 --> 5999.28
thank god though there aren't any

5996.719 --> 6003.04
freaking satellites orbiting up there or

5999.28 --> 6004.719
it would have happened decades ago

6003.04 --> 6006.96
decades ago

6004.719 --> 6008.8
but absolutely inevitable

6006.96 --> 6010.56
like for real

6008.8 --> 6012.08
what is it now a hundred thousand

6010.56 --> 6015.679
satellites

6012.08 --> 6016.96
like not geostationary satellites

6015.679 --> 6020.679
just go

6016.96 --> 6020.679
hundred thousand

6022.48 --> 6025.36
just one of them

6026.0 --> 6031.84
one of them crashes

6027.679 --> 6032.92
and suddenly uncontrolled projectiles

6031.84 --> 6036.0
and all that

6032.92 --> 6038.0
fine-tuned pathway for all the orbits

6036.0 --> 6041.199
supposedly that makes it all fit and not

6038.0 --> 6042.239
crash yeah just one little scratch

6041.199 --> 6044.32
one

6042.239 --> 6046.48
communication malfunction in the

6044.32 --> 6048.84
controls and suddenly it makes the wrong

6046.48 --> 6052.159
move and it's

6048.84 --> 6054.96
back all gone

6052.159 --> 6056.638999999999
in like a week it's all gone it's total

6054.96 --> 6059.36
nonsense like

6056.639 --> 6062.400000000001
there are no satellites up there

6059.36 --> 6065.4
33 000 okay

6062.4 --> 6065.4
right

6080.48 --> 6083.48
hmm

6092.719 --> 6098.76
all satellites that crash have a balloon

6094.96 --> 6098.76
attached to it that's hilarious

6108.88 --> 6112.400000000001
all right

6110.56 --> 6115.280000000001
it's also because

6112.4 --> 6117.759999999999
it is kind of like sloppily suggested

6115.28 --> 6120.4
that if a satellite

6117.76 --> 6122.4800000000005
falls out of its orbit

6120.4 --> 6124.5599999999995
then it's gonna go into re-entry and

6122.48 --> 6127.28
it's gonna burn up like a meteor right

6124.56 --> 6127.280000000001
remember that

6127.36 --> 6130.48
when does that ever happen

6132.48 --> 6135.48
ever

6150.239 --> 6155.599999999999
marconi bounced radio waves off the sky

6160.84 --> 6168.04
huh is that where the

6163.44 --> 6168.04
idea came from of the stratospheric

6171.76 --> 6175.84
the

6172.44 --> 6178.96
ionospheric radio

6175.84 --> 6178.96
is that where that comes from

6188.08 --> 6191.08
crazy

6195.04 --> 6199.6
crazy to the nice satellites oh

6197.84 --> 6202.08
so crazy

6199.6 --> 6203.84
why why is it crazy you don't need them

6202.08 --> 6205.76
they're completely superfluous

6203.84 --> 6207.84
technology

6205.76 --> 6212.08
you literally don't need that you can do

6207.84 --> 6213.52
almost anything with radio towers almost

6212.08 --> 6216.159
anything

6213.52 --> 6219.119000000001
but hey you might want to have some

6216.159 --> 6221.5199999999995
balloon high up

6219.119 --> 6222.96
assistance

6221.52 --> 6224.88
right another

6222.96 --> 6228.08
a relay

6224.88 --> 6230.400000000001
a sat loon can be useful for that

6228.08 --> 6233.4
but overall you don't need that you just

6230.4 --> 6233.4
don't

6233.679 --> 6238.96
because radio towers go very very far

6237.44 --> 6241.44
on the flat earth

6238.96 --> 6244.0
if you need them to

6241.44 --> 6246.48
right only thing that's gonna

6244.0 --> 6248.719
prevent them from reaching anything is

6246.48 --> 6250.0
physical obstruction like a mountain

6248.719 --> 6252.2390000000005
range right

6250.0 --> 6254.719
radio towers might be

6252.239 --> 6256.959999999999
not be able to reach places if there's

6254.719 --> 6258.2390000000005
if there's like a

6256.96 --> 6260.4
valley

6258.239 --> 6262.718999999999
in between mountains yeah it's not going

6260.4 --> 6264.879999999999
to reach there unless the tower is

6262.719 --> 6267.44
literally built on the peaks of the

6264.88 --> 6267.4400000000005
mountains

6267.52 --> 6272.080000000001
right so for some occasions yeah a

6270.0 --> 6275.04
satellite might be quite handy to have

6272.08 --> 6277.76
hanging somewhere so you have signal

6275.04 --> 6280.48
down in valleys as well

6277.76 --> 6282.88
but overall radio towers will just reach

6280.48 --> 6282.879999999999
anywhere

6284.96 --> 6289.08
at vast vast distances

6290.159 --> 6295.04
look for yourself if you do not trust me

6295.52 --> 6301.52
you can see them fly over at night oh

6298.56 --> 6302.96
really what is that

6301.52 --> 6305.1990000000005
it's funny that you mentioned that

6302.96 --> 6309.119
because i have actually seen something

6305.199 --> 6309.119
that i thought like that's not a plane

6309.28 --> 6317.84
i saw a weird blinking light

6313.679 --> 6317.84
and it was really far away

6319.76 --> 6324.400000000001
i saw that like half a week ago i failed

6322.719 --> 6327.4
to mention it because it was just like

6324.4 --> 6327.4
what

6331.679 --> 6336.159
not blinking while the what the thing

6333.28 --> 6337.84
that i saw was blinking

6336.159 --> 6339.839999999999
and

6337.84 --> 6342.2390000000005
i can't imagine it was a plane because

6339.84 --> 6344.8
it was extremely high

6342.239 --> 6346.48
like that light was so minuscule it was

6344.8 --> 6347.679
so high up that couldn't have been a

6346.48 --> 6351.44
plane

6347.679 --> 6351.4400000000005
maybe i i sized it up wrong

6351.84 --> 6356.159000000001
but i have seen like

6354.4 --> 6359.159
things that you could imagine being

6356.159 --> 6359.159
satellites

6359.84 --> 6366.8
there's even like weird infrared light

6363.84 --> 6368.639
ufo like phenomenon

6366.8 --> 6371.1990000000005
like weird

6368.639 --> 6373.679
infrared bass traveling lights

6371.199 --> 6376.719
on a regular basis that happen up there

6373.679 --> 6379.6
it's very odd the celestial lights are

6376.719 --> 6379.6
very weird

6379.92 --> 6383.36
it's not just one straightforward

6381.76 --> 6385.679
picture there's

6383.36 --> 6386.639
odd elements

6385.679 --> 6389.52
right

6386.639 --> 6391.92
if you can actually go up there and then

6389.52 --> 6393.84
do like the telescope thing let the

6391.92 --> 6396.8
light burn in in it

6393.84 --> 6399.360000000001
and then get these fractal

6396.8 --> 6401.92
galactic things that you get to see yeah

6399.36 --> 6404.5599999999995
that's pretty pretty weird right and

6401.92 --> 6407.119
when you then stare at the sky at night

6404.56 --> 6409.679
with the infrared and you see like

6407.119 --> 6412.5599999999995
traveling lights almost like little

6409.679 --> 6415.1990000000005
fishies or something yeah that's pretty

6412.56 --> 6417.360000000001
damn weird because the celestial lights

6415.199 --> 6419.04
are really weird and there's a lot more

6417.36 --> 6421.5199999999995
to them than just

6419.04 --> 6425.639
what you see with the naked eye

6421.52 --> 6425.639
celestial lights are weird

6434.719 --> 6440.4
i can see a shiny bus at five miles away

6438.159 --> 6440.4
right

6440.639 --> 6443.28
here you kid

6442.159 --> 6446.719
definitely
