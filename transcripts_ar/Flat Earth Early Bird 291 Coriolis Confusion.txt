6.15 --> 36.219
[Music]

39.0 --> 46.15
good morning welcome to flatter the

42.79 --> 47.47
earlybird number 291 I'm your host

46.15 --> 49.269999999999996
Arwen and before we start the show

47.47 --> 51.73
please don't forget to share it on any

49.27 --> 53.14
platform you deem fit and also if you

51.73 --> 54.879
haven't already subscribed to my channel

53.14 --> 56.47
and hit the bell notification so you

54.879 --> 59.14
know when I'm going live which is

56.47 --> 61.54
normally two PM MCM time every day

59.14 --> 63.19
please also do support my channel

61.54 --> 65.53
through the Super chats but preferably

63.19 --> 69.58
through the paypal patreon and my

65.53 --> 74.92
GoFundMe that will be much obliged so

69.58 --> 80.05
welcome everyone whether today is a bit

74.92 --> 84.16
hotter than yesterday again but yeah not

80.05 --> 89.759
so hot that I you know need to take off

84.16 --> 93.399
my t-shirt so it's all good oh I got

89.759 --> 99.07
Tamera coffee with me today tangerine

93.399 --> 101.369
and tea and nice cold water kind of

99.07 --> 101.369
needed

110.72 --> 117.72
so yeah right before this I was on the

113.549 --> 125.25
Roxanne's hangout oh yeah I'm not on the

117.72 --> 130.02
hangout but in chat I was in the globe

125.25 --> 131.61
denier Roxanne the globe denier right so

130.02 --> 134.09
yeah that was pretty interesting and

131.61 --> 136.26000000000002
three-way hangout they seem to have

134.09 --> 139.59
technical difficulties with their

136.26 --> 144.82999999999998
interfacing program on a regular basis

139.59 --> 144.83
so I hope they get that right eventually

144.92 --> 149.30999999999997
that's always fun to listen a lot of

147.45 --> 157.48899999999998
people get in on chat over there as well

149.31 --> 157.489
so it's always good to say hello so

157.91 --> 165.81
let's see it was in my chat over here

161.0 --> 171.45
a GM was first doc Michael stone monkey

165.81 --> 172.08
3d Steve I'm and a young and they like

171.45 --> 174.569
oh hi oh

172.08 --> 178.769
flatout faith Michael Rock oh sure oh

174.569 --> 188.35899999999998
six a flat earth champ unicorn laser

178.769 --> 193.859
eyes Dave rakija cafard bandsaw bandit

188.359 --> 199.41
yeah good to see you all so man

193.859 --> 201.329
yesterday was can't believe like on the

199.41 --> 203.34
debates and after that just kept on

201.329 --> 205.20000000000002
continuing and continuing the choreo

203.34 --> 209.42000000000002
this the choreo this is always the

205.2 --> 216.569
freakin coriolis I think I can't believe

209.42 --> 219.35899999999998
they still don't get this I mean Nathan

216.569 --> 222.75
and we couldn't have possibly made it

219.359 --> 225.959
more obviously clear for people to get

222.75 --> 229.739
right right there is Coriolis or there

225.959 --> 234.68
is not and even when they weirdly switch

229.739 --> 234.68
around with their concepts about it

234.739 --> 241.409
you can't have Coriolis and not have

238.14 --> 244.319
Coriolis at the same presumed height as

241.409 --> 247.26
it were so even if they're gonna presume

244.319 --> 251.219
some kind of Coriolis gradient because

247.26 --> 261.449
that's now starting to come afloat so it

251.219 --> 265.08
seems that according to them the layer

261.449 --> 268.289
now is supposedly stationary close at

265.08 --> 272.669
the earth and then really far out really

268.289 --> 276.12
really far away there suddenly the

272.669 --> 279.79999999999995
Coriolis starts to set in because the

276.12 --> 283.47
atmosphere is no longer really moving or

279.8 --> 285.419
some say there's now no atmosphere so it

283.47 --> 287.91
all moves with it as soon as it escapes

285.419 --> 290.34
the atmosphere that Coriolis sets in

287.91 --> 295.5
well wherever you're gonna put that

290.34 --> 298.58
border as it were that's where Coriolis

295.5 --> 300.87
from that point on is going to be

298.58 --> 303.05
potentially noticeable presuming the

300.87 --> 307.229
earth would be a globe and spinning okay

303.05 --> 315.199
the thing is that all these claims

307.229 --> 318.36
remain about objects supposedly just not

315.199 --> 321.78000000000003
still having Coriolis somehow and that

318.36 --> 327.659
just seems so weird because say for

321.78 --> 330.21
example you ignore the whole a gyroscope

327.659 --> 332.52
thing which is one of the first things

330.21 --> 335.58
you would definitely notice if ya if the

332.52 --> 337.08
place wouldn't wasn't stationary yeah

335.58 --> 340.19899999999996
that's a whole separate thing that

337.08 --> 342.15
completely smashes it but let's not take

340.199 --> 344.969
a look at that and just look at for

342.15 --> 347.28
example momentum things like a bullet

344.969 --> 349.71
goes really fast and that stable and the

347.28 --> 356.07
spin of it kind of stabilizes its path

349.71 --> 358.71
right so what would be causing Coriolis

356.07 --> 361.8
if not the push of the atmosphere

358.71 --> 364.94899999999996
against it presuming it would be

361.8 --> 368.039
spinning then what would be causing that

364.949 --> 375.93
Coriolis why would it be deviating

368.039 --> 380.52
I don't get it are they kind of

375.93 --> 386.219
suggesting it's having a gyroscope like

380.52 --> 388.889
effect which then stabilizes its path

386.219 --> 391.169
despite that gyroscopes when you

388.889 --> 396.089
actually have them don't do that

391.169 --> 398.74899999999997
is that what to try to aim for now I was

396.089 --> 398.749
just wondering

402.719 --> 407.30899999999997
yeah I'm pretty sure Ragnar Stefan

405.149 --> 412.499
Alderson that there is no coriolis on

407.309 --> 419.069
earth because it's stationary pretty

412.499 --> 422.23900000000003
sure yeah yeah mercury m7 you're

419.069 --> 425.639
completely right oh my god hahahaha

422.239 --> 428.599
you're completely right the problem is

425.639 --> 434.029
there is no Coriolis it's not there

428.599 --> 438.209
remember the planes not arriving at the

434.029 --> 440.849
Coriolis required times and all that so

438.209 --> 443.999
it's not there so then you can presume

440.849 --> 446.24899999999997
oh wait that means it's not at the

443.999 --> 448.769
height where Coriolis could grip it or

446.249 --> 451.829
whatever you know okay so that means

448.769 --> 453.419
that higher than planes Coriolis could

451.829 --> 455.669
set in that would be the start that

453.419 --> 458.99899999999997
would be the excuse to move the argument

455.669 --> 461.339
as well well then in that case what

458.999 --> 464.23900000000003
would be causing Coriolis thinks from

461.339 --> 468.86
the ground that doesn't make any sense

464.239 --> 468.85999999999996
see see the issue

470.83 --> 480.539
[Music]

481.499 --> 490.97900000000004
just a tangerine Amanda young so add

486.689 --> 490.97900000000004
it's not that difficult really

494.23 --> 500.62
you know that's the whole thing we can

498.1 --> 503.14000000000004
precip maybe that's why the Coriolis

500.62 --> 508.24
confusion is so inviting for Globus

503.14 --> 510.84
because it forces flat earthers to start

508.24 --> 514.87
presupposing the globe and it's spinning

510.84 --> 517.6899999999999
just in order to explain that it can be

514.87 --> 519.94
because the required effects are not

517.69 --> 523.12
manifesting so maybe they're just trying

519.94 --> 524.95
to waste our time forcing us to

523.12 --> 527.17
presuppose their globe and that's just

524.95 --> 528.94
like a religious thing they just want

527.17 --> 530.8
the globe to be in our mind constantly

528.94 --> 534.5200000000001
as we describe things maybe that is the

530.8 --> 536.89
reason why they keep on doing it they're

534.52 --> 538.6899999999999
forcing us to come to their realm in

536.89 --> 542.64
order to point out the mistakes that

538.69 --> 542.6400000000001
they are making assuming their realm

557.67 --> 562.4699999999999
yeah what is it reca 7 how listen I

560.19 --> 566.1300000000001
answered your question there is no

562.47 --> 569.7900000000001
Coriolis effect on earth unless there is

566.13 --> 572.52
something moving separate from the earth

569.79 --> 573.9599999999999
so like a car or whatever then Coriolis

572.52 --> 576.93
could be experienced because suddenly

573.96 --> 580.2900000000001
there are two reference frame a non

576.93 --> 583.01
inertial reference frame and the second

580.29 --> 583.01
reference frame

598.47 --> 606.97
Haidee I'm good question I've been kind

603.9 --> 610.4399999999999
but kind of keeping that in my mind in

606.97 --> 614.77
the background because there seems to be

610.44 --> 617.2
extra propaganda pushed about fires

614.77 --> 621.25
supposedly in the Amazon being lit by

617.2 --> 623.44
passion arrow and I've had some serious

621.25 --> 628.12
concerns about that and the guy is kind

623.44 --> 629.86
of spouting agitation stuff so it's kind

628.12 --> 632.23
of like threatening with it just to keep

629.86 --> 635.5
everybody on their toes there maybe it's

632.23 --> 638.5
a trump tactic or whatever but it seems

635.5 --> 641.62
that the app the apparatus the media

638.5 --> 644.29
apparatus is using old photography from

641.62 --> 646.03
all situations to kind of suggest that

644.29 --> 648.5799999999999
that is happening right now and it

646.03 --> 651.31
doesn't seem to be the case even though

648.58 --> 655.4200000000001
the yeah Boston era definitely has

651.31 --> 657.79
stated that they would cut down more

655.42 --> 662.89
jungle and everything for whatever their

657.79 --> 665.74
projects are living space whatever is so

662.89 --> 669.28
they are kind of doing that but not in

665.74 --> 672.04
the way as the media show so it's it's

669.28 --> 677.56
just a very uncomfortable situation to

672.04 --> 681.52
me because I don't like that that's

677.56 --> 683.92
happening as you may remember from

681.52 --> 689.59
earlier early birds I don't appreciate

683.92 --> 691.3299999999999
it when just yeah it sounds so weird you

689.59 --> 694.21
know rainforest it's kind of hostile

691.33 --> 699.64
it's all that but it yeah there's just

694.21 --> 702.7900000000001
all kinds of unique things there I'd say

699.64 --> 706.12
I bought into that and you could also

702.79 --> 709.36
say look technically we've may have come

706.12 --> 711.85
to a stage technologically and with our

709.36 --> 714.73
understanding of how to influence

711.85 --> 718.15
atmosphere and the air and all that that

714.73 --> 721.33
we may technically not really need the

718.15 --> 724.4499999999999
rainforest anymore but that's you know

721.33 --> 726.36
that's the typical type of setup that

724.45 --> 728.11
always leads to some kind of unexpected

726.36 --> 731.03
Cataclysm

728.11 --> 733.97
so is when some group arrogantly think

731.03 --> 736.37
they no longer lead need something that

733.97 --> 738.8000000000001
when they then destroy that or sacrifice

736.37 --> 741.43
it or whatever then afterwards they find

738.8 --> 749.93
out what they actually did need it for

741.43 --> 752.89
it always happens so I still don't like

749.93 --> 752.89
that that's going on

771.829 --> 777.019
yeah a reckoner Stefan hey listen what

775.31 --> 783.1389999999999
are the two reference frames on earth

777.019 --> 787.49
well this the earth and whatever is

783.139 --> 790.63
moving in relation to the earth those

787.49 --> 790.63
are the two reference frames

801.66 --> 808.3299999999999
whether that is presumed to be air

804.54 --> 811.5999999999999
around the earth not spinning as fast as

808.33 --> 818.71
the standard spin of the earth or some

811.6 --> 821.37
object moving in relation to it to

818.71 --> 821.37
reference

827.14 --> 832.18
down please super fair

836.64 --> 839.87
[Music]

840.75 --> 849.82
right if you're gonna be firing firing a

845.61 --> 853.42
bullet from a stationary setting on the

849.82 --> 855.4300000000001
earth and then it is going to be the

853.42 --> 857.8499999999999
second reference frame in relation to

855.43 --> 857.8499999999999
the earth

865.55 --> 872.0
[Music]

868.45 --> 874.4300000000001
and the air surrounding it presumably

872.0 --> 877.07
which is presuming the stationery in

874.43 --> 879.14
relation to the earth is also going to

877.07 --> 881.7800000000001
be part of that first reference frame

879.14 --> 882.29
because it is stationary in relation to

881.78 --> 889.43
the earth

882.29 --> 892.67
I know Ragnar Stefan help us and it's

889.43 --> 896.9
all very easy to prove so extremely

892.67 --> 899.39
straightforward basic stuff and I don't

896.9 --> 901.52
know they just love dwelling around it

899.39 --> 904.34
and just when you get it right to say

901.52 --> 906.25
aha you just don't understand this is so

904.34 --> 909.98
stupid why don't you get it

906.25 --> 911.71
you can't be thinking this because you

909.98 --> 916.09
don't believe the earth is spinning

911.71 --> 916.09
that's really what it's all about

917.47 --> 923.5
it's just arrogant troll manure

973.42 --> 983.0799999999999
yeah sure super curve keep on spamming

976.66 --> 987.8199999999999
that [ __ ] keep going that's that

983.08 --> 989.6500000000001
can't happen already told you whatever

987.82 --> 993.5500000000001
you gonna do with a bullet from the

989.65 --> 996.1899999999999
ground if there is a plane or a

993.55 --> 999.55
helicopter if a helicopter at any height

996.19 --> 1004.8900000000001
can remain stationary without constantly

999.55 --> 1007.4399999999999
dipping to stay on this that position of

1004.89 --> 1011.1899999999999
relation to the earth and if planes

1007.44 --> 1013.9200000000001
don't have extra speed one way and less

1011.19 --> 1018.74
speed the other way at for the same

1013.92 --> 1021.5699999999999
distances then yeah the claim that

1018.74 --> 1024.57
supposedly Coriolis applies to bullets

1021.57 --> 1031.98
is simply false because what would be

1024.57 --> 1037.35
causing the Coriolis effect that doesn't

1031.98 --> 1040.1100000000001
nothing is causing it because yeah if

1037.35 --> 1042.1499999999999
it's not gonna happen to a helicopter or

1040.11 --> 1044.6
an airplane it's not gonna happen to a

1042.15 --> 1044.6000000000001
bullet

1059.72 --> 1066.15
what what are you talking about no

1064.679 --> 1068.94
rector stuff and how they send you

1066.15 --> 1072.96
obviously just I don't know what you're

1068.94 --> 1076.0800000000002
doing but that's I didn't say the

1072.96 --> 1080.25
Coriolis effect doesn't exist I simply

1076.08 --> 1084.57
said it's not when you have projectiles

1080.25 --> 1088.46
from the earth doing something anything

1084.57 --> 1091.32
moving there is not gonna be Coriolis

1088.46 --> 1094.28
just from that thing moving over the

1091.32 --> 1098.1299999999999
earth or in the atmosphere because

1094.28 --> 1100.49
nothing does so you can be selective

1098.13 --> 1100.49
with that

1110.98 --> 1121.24
no no Cory huh yeah you're just

1119.71 --> 1124.44
red-herring me now this is really

1121.24 --> 1131.34
annoying you know what I mean

1124.44 --> 1135.1000000000001
Jesus a Coriolis spin deviation okay

1131.34 --> 1138.4199999999998
that's what I'm talking about not just

1135.1 --> 1138.4199999999998
things moving

1180.51 --> 1189.51
right hmm so yeah

1184.169 --> 1193.679
enough about Coriolis I can't believe

1189.51 --> 1197.57
that I'm that I'm even still trying to

1193.679 --> 1197.5700000000002
bring some clarity in this at this point

1205.299 --> 1207.96
yeah

1238.6 --> 1246.07
yeah I know AGM it's just always going

1241.75 --> 1249.22
around and I don't know at this point I

1246.07 --> 1251.11
even be almost happy to get one of those

1249.22 --> 1254.83
ballers that thinks they can defend

1251.11 --> 1259.75
Coriolis effect and go at it face to

1254.83 --> 1262.389
face because Nathan gets to do all the

1259.75 --> 1266.88
shouting oh I can do that too probably a

1262.389 --> 1266.8799999999999
lot more effective yeah

1272.799 --> 1276.84
I'd like to yeah right

1284.88 --> 1291.67
also like man the ballers are really

1289.51 --> 1294.51
staying away it seemed like except for

1291.67 --> 1294.51
the standard rolls

1299.16 --> 1307.0800000000002
so apparently I'm just not interesting

1301.59 --> 1313.039
enough anymore then again I did

1307.08 --> 1313.039
basically just outright ignore them all

1315.23 --> 1321.929
but I don't know I I think it would be

1318.09 --> 1324.4099999999999
funny for example to what do you say

1321.929 --> 1329.16
like get conspiracy cats on again

1324.41 --> 1332.039
and let's talk with him about his fuel

1329.16 --> 1335.25
on the Coriolis effect what yeah

1332.039 --> 1337.3799999999999
and just and now yeah I know I abandon

1335.25 --> 1341.309
all but I actually unbanned conspiracy

1337.38 --> 1343.64
cats I'm still gonna ban every freaking

1341.309 --> 1346.35
troll that comes in and asks to give

1343.64 --> 1349.0700000000002
conspiracy cats a wrench of course but

1346.35 --> 1353.1589999999999
that doesn't mean that if he himself

1349.07 --> 1355.32
drops that silly attitude and is willing

1353.159 --> 1357.8700000000001
to just have a conversation again that I

1355.32 --> 1361.59
would be willing to do it and yeah it

1357.87 --> 1365.1299999999999
would not be the the ranty show style if

1361.59 --> 1366.8999999999999
you know what I mean but hey I can get

1365.13 --> 1370.5800000000002
some interesting things out of people as

1366.9 --> 1370.5800000000002
well you know we

1391.58 --> 1397.779
oh I want Steph a reckoner Stephanie

1394.61 --> 1397.779
listen don't worry about that

1408.97 --> 1413.7
oh hey Jeffrey bill

1422.25 --> 1425.25
anyway

1433.07 --> 1439.83
I'm just wondering like what for example

1436.71 --> 1443.3400000000001
what yeah because you know Randy does

1439.83 --> 1445.799
like to set tricky things up and put

1443.34 --> 1448.77
people on the edge of their what he

1445.799 --> 1450.4189999999999
thinks is their pressure limit it just

1448.77 --> 1454.44
likes to do that and that's what I

1450.419 --> 1457.3200000000002
specifically dislike about him because

1454.44 --> 1461.6100000000001
it's going too far but yeah what would

1457.32 --> 1463.74
happen if I got on on with somebody like

1461.61 --> 1466.74
in a baller or some kinds for example

1463.74 --> 1471.75
Brenda on his show I bet he would then

1466.74 --> 1474.9
just drag in a lot of other ballers

1471.75 --> 1478.23
without asking me even if I asked him

1474.9 --> 1481.98
not to so it's one of the reasons why

1478.23 --> 1484.4
I'm very hesitant because you know if I

1481.98 --> 1489.15
get ballers on my show then they know

1484.4 --> 1491.6100000000001
they will have a fair shot and things

1489.15 --> 1497.789
can stay civil and they will definitely

1491.61 --> 1499.8899999999999
not be pushed around a lot unless they

1497.789 --> 1505.14
start pushing me around of course that's

1499.89 --> 1508.89
another matter so I don't know it's been

1505.14 --> 1514.1000000000001
very quiet here last time I had a baller

1508.89 --> 1514.1000000000001
on his months ago now

1519.12 --> 1535.9199999999998
oh yeah

1525.84 --> 1538.1999999999998
Oh glean was um sorry yeah

1535.92 --> 1541.89
gleam was on Randy's as well by the way

1538.2 --> 1543.93
I watched some of that I remember also

1541.89 --> 1547.17
our God there were like three things at

1543.93 --> 1551.46
the same time Martin Lydia's a premiere

1547.17 --> 1554.91
which was pretty interesting it was a

1551.46 --> 1556.89
typical mixed type of show it just it's

1554.91 --> 1560.52
it's just Martin Lee it gets just what

1556.89 --> 1562.5700000000002
he does fooling around a bit some

1560.52 --> 1564.35
serious stuff and some goofing around

1562.57 --> 1567.48
[Music]

1564.35 --> 1572.85
doing his little minor wizardry thingies

1567.48 --> 1575.91
for fun and yeah Randy show would gleam

1572.85 --> 1579.7199999999998
that was pretty interesting claim is

1575.91 --> 1587.8200000000002
that guy it has some interesting

1579.72 --> 1590.64
insights okay and yeah the Flat Earth

1587.82 --> 1596.3899999999999
debates after show which was extremely

1590.64 --> 1599.39
long again so yeah I was a busy evening

1596.39 --> 1599.39
yesterday

1603.05 --> 1609.59
right morning yeah right no Martin was

1606.14 --> 1613.1000000000001
before that no was ayran realmedia yeah

1609.59 --> 1615.1999999999998
that iron realmedia Kadima noranti and

1613.1 --> 1619.1
Flat Earth debate after show all

1615.2 --> 1623.6200000000001
simultaneously morons Martin's premiere

1619.1 --> 1623.62
was before that right

1638.83 --> 1641.82
Oh God

1665.47 --> 1677.16
I don't I'd have no favorite and hater

1670.24 --> 1680.17
I don't favor any of them there are some

1677.16 --> 1684.3700000000001
ballers however that have amusing

1680.17 --> 1687.79
qualities and I do favor that as for

1684.37 --> 1690.2199999999998
just the hating of Flat Earth and that

1687.79 --> 1694.0
behavior that ties into that I literally

1690.22 --> 1696.63
just don't differentiate it just all the

1694.0 --> 1696.63
same [ __ ]

1703.93 --> 1710.5
but for example I do find rumpus very

1707.26 --> 1714.64
amusing at times and terrible like

1710.5 --> 1718.84
horrific at other times like so in your

1714.64 --> 1723.49
face just lying so hard like with such a

1718.84 --> 1725.7099999999998
heart push it's just insane so but at

1723.49 --> 1727.48
times he's just very amusing in the ways

1725.71 --> 1732.64
way he does things I don't know it's

1727.48 --> 1734.8600000000001
it's like a an autistic creation what

1732.64 --> 1737.38
he's made of himself it's fascinating to

1734.86 --> 1740.4399999999998
me and I don't know there are some other

1737.38 --> 1742.92
ballers as well for example tody has his

1740.44 --> 1742.92
moments

1743.49 --> 1749.59
even though he is also just as much

1746.38 --> 1754.95
typical baller will go down way in the

1749.59 --> 1757.9299999999998
gutter when tasked to basically as

1754.95 --> 1763.0900000000001
ballers do when they're really caught

1757.93 --> 1765.3400000000001
yeah caught out something but and yeah

1763.09 --> 1767.86
many I don't know many of these regulars

1765.34 --> 1770.77
on how they I yeah even though they are

1767.86 --> 1773.4399999999998
so typically baller they do have

1770.77 --> 1775.8899999999999
interesting elements to them and then

1773.44 --> 1779.14
there are a couple that are just

1775.89 --> 1782.3500000000001
freaking trash they're literally trash

1779.14 --> 1785.47
nothing that comes out of them has any

1782.35 --> 1788.53
kind of original value it's all

1785.47 --> 1790.8700000000001
secondhand adding on stuff that people

1788.53 --> 1793.32
already know and getting in everyone's

1790.87 --> 1796.75
way and being disruptive and whiny and

1793.32 --> 1799.83
those are just like the worst and yeah

1796.75 --> 1802.83
when they get in my way I start shouting

1799.83 --> 1802.83
usually

1805.04 --> 1812.0
but a if like other like if somebody

1810.11 --> 1814.4599999999998
would in let's just say it like this if

1812.0 --> 1818.36
a baller can interrupt me with something

1814.46 --> 1821.0900000000001
interesting in complex that is not some

1818.36 --> 1823.25
kind of rerun but really an original

1821.09 --> 1825.8899999999999
idea conceptualization in the moment

1823.25 --> 1829.43
then that has much more value to me than

1825.89 --> 1833.3600000000001
just somebody whining if you know what I

1829.43 --> 1840.3700000000001
mean or trying to apply peer pressure in

1833.36 --> 1840.37
some way so that's how I see it you know

1841.75 --> 1850.19
maybe it is kind of like weighing turds

1847.22 --> 1853.03
and comparing the weight but still there

1850.19 --> 1853.03
is a weight difference

1861.05 --> 1864.27
[Music]

1864.409 --> 1868.0200000000002
maybe you should try a little bit harder

1867.09 --> 1871.9189999999999
on yourself

1868.02 --> 1875.25
super curve instead of appointing

1871.919 --> 1879.0
yourself to be the one to snap me out of

1875.25 --> 1881.63
my supposed to delusion yeah well that's

1879.0 --> 1881.63
not gonna work

1898.09 --> 1905.02
right magnetic field sure at least

1901.96 --> 1909.07
you're asking questions okay magnetic

1905.02 --> 1915.76
fields what causes them well I'm pretty

1909.07 --> 1922.4399999999998
sure that what I think is really going

1915.76 --> 1925.21
on is that there are just big chunks or

1922.44 --> 1929.17
fragments spread around it's mostly the

1925.21 --> 1933.67
magnetized metal especially metal high

1929.17 --> 1936.8200000000002
metal containing rock in in the earth

1933.67 --> 1939.18
layers as it were layers like in the

1936.82 --> 1941.53
earth in in the rock formations

1939.18 --> 1948.24
mountainous areas that are high in iron

1941.53 --> 1952.48
iron for example yeah if they're not

1948.24 --> 1955.81
changed if they're set in yeah like a

1952.48 --> 1959.1100000000001
magnet is set if it's set and it is not

1955.81 --> 1962.02
being influenced so that the setting of

1959.11 --> 1966.0
the magnetism could alter radically like

1962.02 --> 1970.54
for example extreme force abrupt force

1966.0 --> 1972.21
but that would be no that's not gonna

1970.54 --> 1975.04
happen

1972.21 --> 1978.1000000000001
but that is like when you have a regular

1975.04 --> 1982.8899999999999
magnet and you bash it a lot it may use

1978.1 --> 1982.8899999999999
its its magnetism that's what I learned

1983.46 --> 1988.8
abrupt force anyway maybe that's mistake

1986.17 --> 1992.89
and maybe it's just you thing that I

1988.8 --> 1995.5
that's left and I don't know but it's

1992.89 --> 1998.7700000000002
basically the metals in the rock that

1995.5 --> 2001.59
are set to a certain polarization

1998.77 --> 2005.82
setting and how that manifested is

2001.59 --> 2008.52
likely upon creation so the energies

2005.82 --> 2012.03
that would have originally orientated

2008.52 --> 2014.22
all the metals to be polarized in the

2012.03 --> 2018.3899999999999
setting that they are in the places they

2014.22 --> 2021.81
are which is all around the earth that

2018.39 --> 2026.5200000000002
was already there so in that sense you

2021.81 --> 2028.9199999999998
could presume that some the the source

2026.52 --> 2031.6299999999999
of the electricity which is probably the

2028.92 --> 2034.8400000000001
ether as a lot of people are now as

2031.63 --> 2039.18
zooming that the electric ether as it

2034.84 --> 2043.03
were that it was already manifested as

2039.18 --> 2045.8200000000002
material was basically being summoned

2043.03 --> 2052.0
didn't however that happened solidified

2045.82 --> 2056.04
and then it got locked in so the

2052.0 --> 2058.69
electrical activities over the earth

2056.04 --> 2061.69
they just go they may be a little bit

2058.69 --> 2065.56
more dynamic but the magnetic activity

2061.69 --> 2067.2400000000002
from the magnetized Rock they are still

2065.56 --> 2069.94
there and they are pretty much set

2067.24 --> 2074.95
they're much harder to change as far as

2069.94 --> 2077.29
I understand or there is even another an

2074.95 --> 2080.1389999999997
alternative explanation that is that the

2077.29 --> 2082.69
ether is just causing this entirely and

2080.139 --> 2085.54
that even the magnetized Rock is

2082.69 --> 2089.409
basically only a catalyst for this ether

2085.54 --> 2091.5099999999998
and wherever it the focus the focal

2089.409 --> 2094.11
point of the pole moves because

2091.51 --> 2097.3300000000004
apparently you can shift so they say

2094.11 --> 2100.3900000000003
that is where the magnetized rock will

2097.33 --> 2101.92
exert the most magnetic strength as it

2100.39 --> 2111.5099999999998
were and that is going to register

2101.92 --> 2114.82
eventually on a compass so yeah look

2111.51 --> 2116.8300000000004
whatever the ether may be presumed to be

2114.82 --> 2120.5800000000004
doing and this is coming from some

2116.83 --> 2123.1
electrical spec you lists speculators I

2120.58 --> 2125.41
call them an electric universe thinker

2123.1 --> 2128.11
speculators in that directions it is

2125.41 --> 2131.29
still kind of speculative but yeah it is

2128.11 --> 2133.6
very appealing ok but that that could Oh

2131.29 --> 2136.81
many of these assumptions that are now

2133.6 --> 2138.7599999999998
drawn out of like discovered could turn

2136.81 --> 2147.31
out to be apparitions you don't know for

2138.76 --> 2150.5890000000004
sure until you you really perfected from

2147.31 --> 2153.66
all directions anyway

2150.589 --> 2156.3289999999997
it could be it could be that that's just

2153.66 --> 2159.029
like in the realm however it is created

2156.329 --> 2163.549
there is just steady constant energy

2159.029 --> 2166.77
flow and it is just there constantly and

2163.549 --> 2168.93
things are susceptible to it and react

2166.77 --> 2176.46
to it and that is how the whole magnetic

2168.93 --> 2179.94
field is present and day if we're going

2176.46 --> 2185.52
there you could probably tie the Sun in

2179.94 --> 2188.01
with it as well what causes the globe of

2185.52 --> 2190.71
the heaven lights just like they also

2188.01 --> 2193.8190000000004
caused by the ether if you're going by

2190.71 --> 2199.289
that the ether is indeed some kind of

2193.819 --> 2201.589
steady field that can be gripped by

2199.289 --> 2201.5890000000004
matter

2211.9 --> 2215.29
go away

2236.64 --> 2243.31
well mb is a good question do you think

2241.36 --> 2247.63
the source of everything comes from this

2243.31 --> 2251.02
magnetic forces of north pole like ether

2247.63 --> 2254.65
atmosphere etc so the source of

2251.02 --> 2256.81
everything well I think that from what

2254.65 --> 2259.3
how I explained it you should be able to

2256.81 --> 2262.6
understand that I think that all those

2259.3 --> 2265.9300000000003
things are kind of like the side effect

2262.6 --> 2268.39
of the presence of the ether field it is

2265.93 --> 2270.8199999999997
where the energy comes from and the

2268.39 --> 2274.27
design allows it to manifest in the ways

2270.82 --> 2276.1000000000004
that it has that's how I am regarding it

2274.27 --> 2278.22
kind of right now but it's still a bit

2276.1 --> 2282.8399999999997
ethereal it's not scientific

2278.22 --> 2282.8399999999997
it's very conceptual just yet so

2288.95 --> 2299.96
better roid or fuels well I don't know

2296.36 --> 2306.38
the director I'd what you mean do

2299.96 --> 2309.07
toroidal field which toroidal field are

2306.38 --> 2309.07
you talking about

2309.58 --> 2316.16
you mean a toroidal field that discours

2313.43 --> 2318.2
have thought all look this is fits

2316.16 --> 2320.2
perfectly with the disk so the magnetic

2318.2 --> 2323.12
field is going to be a toroidal field

2320.2 --> 2324.43
because it is to a disk and it would

2323.12 --> 2328.5099999999998
just fit perfectly

2324.43 --> 2328.5099999999998
that toroidal field

2333.1 --> 2339.52
because I'm pretty sure that the ether

2335.68 --> 2343.87
if yeah however whatever it exactly is

2339.52 --> 2352.33
is not a field radiating from a point I

2343.87 --> 2356.02
think it is more how could you compare

2352.33 --> 2358.21
this it's just a field of energy that's

2356.02 --> 2360.79
ever-present almost like you could

2358.21 --> 2363.64
conceptualize a microwave constantly

2360.79 --> 2367.6
inserting and being active constantly

2363.64 --> 2369.58
inserting energy into the box where it

2367.6 --> 2372.85
is being inserted to like a constant

2369.58 --> 2375.34
field of energy and if the thing inside

2372.85 --> 2378.04
of it is susceptible to it it will

2375.34 --> 2383.98
respond and start loading I think it is

2378.04 --> 2386.5299999999997
more like that the ether field you

2383.98 --> 2390.93
understand so it's not a literal

2386.53 --> 2395.32
physical object cause like a local

2390.93 --> 2398.56
decent centralized object cause cause

2395.32 --> 2400.9900000000002
the thing the ether field in my opinion

2398.56 --> 2403.6
I think it is just ever-present within

2400.99 --> 2406.06
the realm but there may be some certain

2403.6 --> 2408.79
fluctuations because of the side-effects

2406.06 --> 2412.5099999999998
of everything that is in it causing it

2408.79 --> 2417.12
the way to manifest as we as we can

2412.51 --> 2417.1200000000003
measure it or whatever as we deduce it

2422.27 --> 2430.16
so one could speculate say that there is

2427.49 --> 2432.0499999999997
a spatial limited confine which could be

2430.16 --> 2434.2999999999997
looping would be very convenient no dome

2432.05 --> 2435.7400000000002
required but who knows though whatever

2434.3 --> 2440.3300000000004
does really matter for this

2435.74 --> 2445.7
if there is an ether field within this

2440.33 --> 2448.73
special confined of of this realm then

2445.7 --> 2451.0699999999997
it's also going to respond to respond to

2448.73 --> 2454.22
all that matter all that matter below us

2451.07 --> 2458.0
could be very deep could also be

2454.22 --> 2463.52
subjected to the ether and doing things

2458.0 --> 2467.48
with it a it could it does kind of fit

2463.52 --> 2470.36
my concept of how local volcano pockets

2467.48 --> 2472.76
could come into being local induction

2470.36 --> 2476.63
coil naturally manifesting in this case

2472.76 --> 2482.0
from that ether so somehow being focused

2476.63 --> 2485.3900000000003
to that point in order for the yeah for

2482.0 --> 2489.41
the rocks to heat up and melt and then

2485.39 --> 2492.17
start to exert pressure to the yeah to

2489.41 --> 2494.5299999999997
find the closest exit which should be

2492.17 --> 2494.53
upward

2515.76 --> 2521.369
yeah yuck how is that any of your

2520.74 --> 2527.1
business

2521.369 --> 2529.6400000000003
Papa lazuli Lazar ooh that's none of

2527.1 --> 2529.64
your business

2540.82 --> 2546.04
ya know that's why you're not getting it

2543.5 --> 2546.04
Trish life

2546.77 --> 2555.31
[Music]

2558.93 --> 2562.6699999999996
[Music]

2570.26 --> 2579.8700000000003
hey and be who knows toroidal toroidal

2577.28 --> 2582.1200000000003
toroidal energy now why does just call

2579.87 --> 2585.6
it the ether it is where the energy

2582.12 --> 2592.1099999999997
comes from that is being tapped that you

2585.6 --> 2596.2999999999997
can tap into well that's the problem

2592.11 --> 2596.3
exactly that just

2599.71 --> 2606.9700000000003
if you're gonna delete people saying

2602.26 --> 2609.19
that [ __ ] in this case it's it's it's

2606.97 --> 2612.3999999999996
trying to be a troll but it wasn't

2609.19 --> 2615.369
disgusting at least so then I'll just

2612.4 --> 2616.569
answer it because if you're going to

2615.369 --> 2618.19
delete that [ __ ] they're just gonna

2616.569 --> 2621.0
troll with it all day that's what they

2618.19 --> 2621.0
do every time

2630.3 --> 2640.0
what what comments what comment are you

2634.0 --> 2647.25
talking about oh yeah we're good

2640.0 --> 2647.25
yeah fine well I didn't need that

2652.24 --> 2657.0
no I didn't mark color because it's no

2654.609 --> 2657.0
one's business

2662.89 --> 2671.91
now realize I'm trying to it's spam

2668.26 --> 2671.9100000000003
prevention okay that's

2683.74 --> 2686.31
right

2695.609 --> 2700.589
right yeah none it's interesting I'm

2698.789 --> 2704.039
actually just gonna respond to it yeah

2700.589 --> 2707.279
it's been a while but it's also because

2704.039 --> 2712.529
well open mouth kissing as they say

2707.279 --> 2715.069
that's very that's very intimate to me

2712.529 --> 2715.069
so

2722.0 --> 2727.43
there have been periods way back where I

2725.3 --> 2732.4100000000003
was kind of more easy with that stuff

2727.43 --> 2734.96
but even with my axe which was I think

2732.41 --> 2739.7
technically the last person that I had

2734.96 --> 2743.2400000000002
serious kissing with and yeah that was

2739.7 --> 2744.95
just that's that's the real kissing and

2743.24 --> 2747.3489999999997
all that just that's flopping around

2744.95 --> 2755.5099999999998
with with the ladies

2747.349 --> 2759.2000000000003
or whatever it I don't feel it really

2755.51 --> 2762.5
adds to anything I guess it's kind of an

2759.2 --> 2764.81
honor you could consider it for your

2762.5 --> 2768.38
male ego write an offer an honor that

2764.81 --> 2770.24
somebody would like to do that that that

2768.38 --> 2774.98
you would be good enough but to actually

2770.24 --> 2778.49
do it no I do I think I'd really only

2774.98 --> 2780.47
kiss somebody that I that I'd have

2778.49 --> 2783.52
actual feelings for otherwise it would

2780.47 --> 2783.52
just feel disgusting

2785.41 --> 2791.7799999999997
not because I am judging it but because

2788.54 --> 2794.839
it would genuinely naturally just not

2791.78 --> 2798.2000000000003
feel very good and I've experienced that

2794.839 --> 2801.109
in the past as well because when I was

2798.2 --> 2806.24
kind of yeah I guess be more slotting

2801.109 --> 2813.08
around with ladies only yeah I kind of

2806.24 --> 2816.0499999999997
did that to comfort myself after a

2813.08 --> 2818.27
period where I had very well at that

2816.05 --> 2821.57
time the longest serious relationship

2818.27 --> 2825.64
that I had and I was hurt from that

2821.57 --> 2828.32
because if I'd feel felt better I

2825.64 --> 2833.45
wouldn't have done that because it would

2828.32 --> 2836.9300000000003
like the the need for the companionship

2833.45 --> 2838.8199999999997
and just the imaginary being close

2836.93 --> 2841.94
together with somebody again it's kind

2838.82 --> 2845.6600000000003
of like you need that you at that time

2841.94 --> 2847.9700000000003
but if and you don't really feel

2845.66 --> 2850.49
disgusting too much about it overall

2847.97 --> 2852.5299999999997
because you already feel kind of bad so

2850.49 --> 2856.359
it's it's different but when I feel

2852.53 --> 2856.3590000000004
really normal it's just no

2857.17 --> 2863.66
y-you know unless you're like really

2859.78 --> 2865.73
attractive and look you can potentially

2863.66 --> 2868.0099999999998
if it just really clicks fall in love

2865.73 --> 2869.66
really quickly and it flame up and you

2868.01 --> 2873.3500000000004
can't stop it that's like the big

2869.66 --> 2876.44
passion stuff but every time I've had

2873.35 --> 2878.75
that big passion only works for me if I

2876.44 --> 2881.81
really start to believe that that person

2878.75 --> 2883.94
would be the one to end up with and I

2881.81 --> 2886.31
had that with my ex like the first

2883.94 --> 2889.55
moment the first few days I just knew

2886.31 --> 2895.16
like I can already see what we're going

2889.55 --> 2899.09
to be doing like I that was just total

2895.16 --> 2905.75
fall in unfortunately that turn didn't

2899.09 --> 2913.6600000000003
turn out to be reciprocated although it

2905.75 --> 2917.21
seemed to it first but I don't know I I

2913.66 --> 2923.5699999999997
do get as I said a few looks here and

2917.21 --> 2926.12
there but I don't the weird thing is

2923.57 --> 2928.4900000000002
often because I do wonder yeah it's

2926.12 --> 2931.79
funny see how just a couple of troll

2928.49 --> 2935.45
questions can just get keep me get me

2931.79 --> 2938.23
going that's why I don't I only been

2935.45 --> 2941.0
really disgusting things not just

2938.23 --> 2943.13
obvious troll questions because all even

2941.0 --> 2950.74
obvious troll questions can accidentally

2943.13 --> 2950.7400000000002
be very good but

2951.19 --> 2962.5
I don't know I going out there in the

2958.99 --> 2966.3999999999996
world it is kind of odd with me seeing

2962.5 --> 2970.42
even other people interact men male and

2966.4 --> 2978.58
female how they talked how did I am very

2970.42 --> 2982.23
alienated from that it's kind of it's

2978.58 --> 2985.65
tough to grasp for me sometimes but I

2982.23 --> 2993.3
often genuinely don't know how to

2985.65 --> 2998.2000000000003
approach somebody because I can't say I

2993.3 --> 3000.15
can't turn down the gear does that make

2998.2 --> 3004.23
sense do you understand what I mean when

3000.15 --> 3008.58
I say that I can't turn down the gear so

3004.23 --> 3012.9900000000002
I just doubt now how to approach

3008.58 --> 3016.62
somebody really casually it's sometimes

3012.99 --> 3019.1099999999997
it kind of works out when there are just

3016.62 --> 3021.27
like good things happening or like oh

3019.11 --> 3025.52
look at the nice there could be short

3021.27 --> 3028.85
thingies but to really approach some

3025.52 --> 3028.85
somebody it's

3031.8 --> 3038.28
like with regular guys that I feel are

3035.91 --> 3040.77
like at least competent enough to have a

3038.28 --> 3042.57
proper conversation I don't have too

3040.77 --> 3044.16
much trouble connecting with them even

3042.57 --> 3048.09
when I meet them out there and I do

3044.16 --> 3054.7799999999997
regularly all kinds of ages mostly

3048.09 --> 3058.7400000000002
between like 20 and 50 but when it comes

3054.78 --> 3060.8700000000003
to women I don't know I the weird thing

3058.74 --> 3067.3399999999997
is I've always been kind of a shy guy

3060.87 --> 3067.3399999999997
never really was able to fix that

3074.96 --> 3084.4700000000003
it's I think that the best situation for

3078.71 --> 3089.51
me would be to just I guess work

3084.47 --> 3093.6189999999997
together with women or do something this

3089.51 --> 3096.92
yeah with them maybe a group whatever so

3093.619 --> 3099.77
that they would get to know me and then

3096.92 --> 3102.29
we'd have a median to share in order to

3099.77 --> 3114.95
connect because I've done that in the

3102.29 --> 3116.74
past and I got yeah no I don't need to

3114.95 --> 3120.16
get laid

3116.74 --> 3120.16
piss off

3123.23 --> 3132.369
I'm looking to meet a real somebody

3126.71 --> 3132.369
that's actually that's trying that once

3132.88 --> 3137.69
that is smart and still wants to do the

3136.13 --> 3138.829
right thing that's basically it that's

3137.69 --> 3141.77
really smart

3138.829 --> 3150.17
and wants to do the right thing and is

3141.77 --> 3152.48
able to adapt I guess potentially with

3150.17 --> 3154.67
challenges which I expect I have my

3152.48 --> 3157.75
challenges and I hope it would be on an

3154.67 --> 3162.02
equal level in a way that we could then

3157.75 --> 3164.06
help each other to quicken to resolve

3162.02 --> 3167.41
the most serious problems about one

3164.06 --> 3171.0789999999997
another because I am definitely willing

3167.41 --> 3173.39
so yeah there I'm open for a much more

3171.079 --> 3179.8100000000004
serious relationship and it would really

3173.39 --> 3183.0699999999997
have to be it must be spiritually

3179.81 --> 3183.07
compatible it just must

3185.86 --> 3191.42
[Music]

3188.42 --> 3191.42
anyway

3196.54 --> 3203.42
but yeah then again that's also my own

3200.45 --> 3207.1699999999996
problem I just have been really spoiled

3203.42 --> 3211.2200000000003
sensory wise you can interpret it in

3207.17 --> 3213.7400000000002
many ways from my ex and it's kind of

3211.22 --> 3217.8199999999997
tough to compare with that except it's

3213.74 --> 3220.6699999999996
just like okay these things were just

3217.82 --> 3224.29
like wow I can't barely imagine anything

3220.67 --> 3227.57
better than that except these things are

3224.29 --> 3231.2799999999997
just in redeemable you can't work with

3227.57 --> 3231.28
that and I'm just hoping that

3243.95 --> 3247.02
[Music]

3248.71 --> 3251.46
Cheers

3253.05 --> 3266.53
it's just that I'm spoiled and when you

3260.62 --> 3269.08
have that big a a intense love period

3266.53 --> 3273.07
that's just gone so close to what you

3269.08 --> 3275.47
really want it's very tough like it is

3273.07 --> 3282.4500000000003
like a curse really it is

3275.47 --> 3285.39
in retrospect it's I just

3282.45 --> 3288.24
every time I think back about how I step

3285.39 --> 3290.7889999999998
basically met her and how I decision

3288.24 --> 3293.549
made its I was just possessed it was

3290.789 --> 3297.69
totally possessed like I can't imagine

3293.549 --> 3299.4
having been able to let that go that

3297.69 --> 3302.16
would probably have turned me insane if

3299.4 --> 3305.94
I did that because I was just totally

3302.16 --> 3310.109
smacked with this girl and I couldn't

3305.94 --> 3311.94
believe that she actually wanted me

3310.109 --> 3314.13
because I didn't really feel all that

3311.94 --> 3321.4700000000003
great about myself at the time but I was

3314.13 --> 3324.9900000000002
at least trying to work on it I had a

3321.47 --> 3328.95
pretty confident posture as it were but

3324.99 --> 3330.99
anyway yeah me spoiled for my

3328.95 --> 3342.5989999999997
ex-girlfriend from a long time ago by

3330.99 --> 3347.0589999999997
now she six years but I'm just not in a

3342.599 --> 3347.059
hurry or well

3348.789 --> 3356.3590000000004
being in a hurry to find somebody can

3351.92 --> 3359.239
lead you to take a quick option and you

3356.359 --> 3361.279
may end up exactly with the opposite

3359.239 --> 3363.829
that you really want because you got in

3361.279 --> 3366.289
a hurry I've had not with relationships

3363.829 --> 3370.279
but I've had those experience with other

3366.289 --> 3374.2990000000004
types of things a lot in my teens so I'm

3370.279 --> 3378.17
just not calming down our win be slow

3374.299 --> 3382.249
grower focus on yourself and eventually

3378.17 --> 3384.41
you will somehow what is now out of

3382.249 --> 3388.66
sight will become inside and you will

3384.41 --> 3388.66
see where you need to go

3402.239 --> 3408.14
Wow

3404.869 --> 3410.029
Wow talk about conspiracy theorists I'd

3408.14 --> 3416.93
like to see some references from that

3410.029 --> 3423.259
for that mercury m7 where are you

3416.93 --> 3427.0389999999998
getting this now if you'd say that

3423.259 --> 3430.059
secret societies have used the flat

3427.039 --> 3435.309
earth knowledge as a secret weapon to

3430.059 --> 3439.029
basically stun the minds of people as

3435.309 --> 3444.4
the official narrative is the globe lie

3439.029 --> 3446.95
then I'd say yes probably it is

3444.4 --> 3451.089
extremely impressive to believe

3446.95 --> 3456.549
something and then suddenly be smashed

3451.089 --> 3459.349
by what seems like a powerful group with

3456.549 --> 3462.049
totally opposite information that's just

3459.349 --> 3465.469
that that blows many people's minds and

3462.049 --> 3469.819
unleashes all kinds of things in them so

3465.469 --> 3473.359
yeah sure secret societies have used the

3469.819 --> 3477.0389999999998
Flat Earth lore for their for their

3473.359 --> 3483.71
schemes also I have no doubt about that

3477.039 --> 3486.7290000000003
I've experienced that in my weird crazy

3483.71 --> 3486.729
journey early on

3513.89 --> 3521.71
yeah and be sorry I'm just I'm not

3518.23 --> 3524.9
interested in your freaking disgusting

3521.71 --> 3527.62
prostitute connections that's why I

3524.9 --> 3530.62
timed you out and couldn't do it again

3527.62 --> 3530.62
okay

3540.39 --> 3544.3799999999997
identify as Cochise

3549.07 --> 3556.09
all right yeah for a follower of Christ

3552.37 --> 3558.5699999999997
would be a technically more accurate way

3556.09 --> 3562.8
to say it Cleary I agree to that I

3558.57 --> 3562.8
worship nobody though

3564.16 --> 3570.91
but its recognition if you understand

3568.02 --> 3574.66
you know if you understand the creator

3570.91 --> 3577.7999999999997
and creation and all of it by

3574.66 --> 3583.0
understanding the truth

3577.8 --> 3585.3700000000003
you literally kneel before that do you

3583.0 --> 3589.53
see the word that's even used in

3585.37 --> 3594.2799999999997
judicial trickery language understanding

3589.53 --> 3598.03
do you see so when I say I understand

3594.28 --> 3600.94
creation and the creator and I am a

3598.03 --> 3604.27
follower of Jesus Christ of his ways of

3600.94 --> 3611.34
the path and even if I say I don't

3604.27 --> 3611.34
worship because I do not relinquish my

3611.55 --> 3620.9100000000003
my spiritual authority to anything as it

3616.81 --> 3625.9
were except to creation itself to the

3620.91 --> 3629.2
natural way as to what is yeah act

3625.9 --> 3636.13
within creation itself the sin and the

3629.2 --> 3639.49
response and all that creation but I've

3636.13 --> 3643.03
learned to basically not worship

3639.49 --> 3646.0899999999997
anything personified I perform

3643.03 --> 3649.36
friendship I try to learn about it

3646.09 --> 3652.69
understand the energies see what it is

3649.36 --> 3658.36
and I try to stay friendly

3652.69 --> 3661.57
I don't seek enemies among the spirits

3658.36 --> 3667.09
as it were among these weird things that

3661.57 --> 3670.06
are apparently out there and when I

3667.09 --> 3672.25
think of God I do pray and then when I

3670.06 --> 3674.86
pray I basically pray to the spirit of

3672.25 --> 3679.78
Jesus that's even how I visualize it

3674.86 --> 3680.6400000000003
that's the the Christ being Holy Spirit

3679.78 --> 3684.3900000000003
or

3680.64 --> 3687.93
it's it's just what I visualized and

3684.39 --> 3695.25
that's definitely Christ that's where I

3687.93 --> 3701.7
want to be on the path as well but I

3695.25 --> 3706.89
just try not yeah when you worship you

3701.7 --> 3710.3399999999997
kind of like say okay I I will just

3706.89 --> 3714.66
blindly take orders but how would you

3710.34 --> 3717.7200000000003
know that whatever you presume an order

3714.66 --> 3720.75
would be from a certain direction would

3717.72 --> 3726.24
be from the right direction if it is an

3720.75 --> 3730.05
order unless the order is not as much in

3726.24 --> 3733.29
order as it is a naturally arriving need

3730.05 --> 3738.0
in the moment and that's not like an

3733.29 --> 3739.89
order it's like you are you have to do

3738.0 --> 3740.73
that it's the natural thing to do you

3739.89 --> 3742.98
must do it

3740.73 --> 3745.5
it was arrived at that moment and then

3742.98 --> 3751.2
you could say okay God ordered you or

3745.5 --> 3758.55
you could say creation has brought this

3751.2 --> 3761.1299999999997
and that's kind of my approach I hope I

3758.55 --> 3763.92
didn't offend anyone with with how I'm

3761.13 --> 3767.25
describing this I really do believe in

3763.92 --> 3773.13
Christ and I absolutely understand the

3767.25 --> 3777.11
Bible in that technical sense but I'm

3773.13 --> 3777.11
finding my way I'm eclectic

3783.899 --> 3786.899
right

3802.48 --> 3814.01
yes right because isn't that the whole

3808.88 --> 3817.58
point taking orders God gives you the

3814.01 --> 3822.67
choice the choice is there whether you

3817.58 --> 3822.67
choose to see it or not it doesn't order

3823.66 --> 3832.1189999999997
that seems like the whole point freedom

3828.53 --> 3832.119
of choice unless you don't believe that

3834.38 --> 3837.82
[Music]

3841.35 --> 3846.199
[Music]

3853.44 --> 3857.06
all right well

3858.53 --> 3862.94
I guess in the moment it technically I

3861.17 --> 3869.21
do kind of agree with you there

3862.94 --> 3873.02
mercury m7 on the other hand yeah look

3869.21 --> 3875.66
there maybe even other ladders of

3873.02 --> 3879.11
thought and word origin with the word

3875.66 --> 3884.93
warship that's another approach to it

3879.11 --> 3887.75
that I've overlooked so it just seems

3884.93 --> 3889.58
that every time the the kalokhe you'll

3887.75 --> 3894.56
the primitive approach of worship is

3889.58 --> 3898.18
basically giving authority over to

3894.56 --> 3898.18
another or to a thing

3904.74 --> 3913.22
oh and by the way considering that right

3908.359 --> 3919.8489999999997
you can't really give authority to God

3913.22 --> 3919.8489999999997
because he has it it's already there so

3921.26 --> 3930.8300000000004
it almost seems pointless just do the

3926.64 --> 3930.83
right thing that's it

3948.41 --> 3954.7799999999997
anyway yeah well I've been going on a

3951.78 --> 3956.9100000000003
little longer than usual so I'm gonna

3954.78 --> 3959.73
run that show but it was it wasn't

3956.91 --> 3963.7799999999997
interesting ending to the conversation I

3959.73 --> 3967.04
hope that everybody is okay with

3963.78 --> 3967.0400000000004
everything that was said

3975.81 --> 3978.7999999999997
no but that's

3990.65 --> 3998.38
now Zep tepi we are definitely not our

3994.16 --> 3998.3799999999997
own gods absolutely not

3998.619 --> 4007.599
to assume that is to misunderstand what

4003.73 --> 4013.18
God even is to assume that would be

4007.599 --> 4018.299
assuming little God and that is well

4013.18 --> 4021.509
that is breaking away from logos usually

4018.299 --> 4025.48
unless you consider that you are a

4021.509 --> 4029.73
little God in the name of the creator

4025.48 --> 4034.119
himself but the thing is about

4029.73 --> 4036.309
accumulating power okay I think I

4034.119 --> 4040.029
pronounced it wrongly accumulating I

4036.309 --> 4045.6400000000003
used to say so the accumulating or a

4040.029 --> 4051.519
could Ellen be started interfering with

4045.64 --> 4059.43
my speech again but I lost my point is

4051.519 --> 4062.3489999999997
stupid right when you accumulate power

4059.43 --> 4065.019
the power nay the nature of that power

4062.349 --> 4067.3900000000003
will bring out more darkness will seduce

4065.019 --> 4072.7589999999996
you more to become Lucifer into step

4067.39 --> 4076.989
away from the path and yea so even if

4072.759 --> 4079.059
you would think to be a little god using

4076.989 --> 4081.94
the power of the creator in your name

4079.059 --> 4084.2200000000003
you will end up eventually doing dark

4081.94 --> 4088.21
things because of the power that binds

4084.22 --> 4090.3089999999997
that it's a very nature of the power and

4088.21 --> 4098.25
the situation and the responsibility and

4090.309 --> 4101.2300000000005
all that so it technically is

4098.25 --> 4104.92
paradoxical it can't work the way

4101.23 --> 4111.5689999999995
presumed it's an ideology it's on the

4104.92 --> 4111.569
long run a mistake to do that

4115.71 --> 4123.57
but yeah it's up to everyone to decide

4118.59 --> 4126.24
how much power they want to wield and if

4123.57 --> 4130.5
they are willing to pay the prices for

4126.24 --> 4133.349999999999
that and you can yeah some of those

4130.5 --> 4134.91
prices may be very obvious and everybody

4133.35 --> 4137.64
will be talking about it and other

4134.91 --> 4139.08
prices will remain mostly unseen for

4137.64 --> 4142.56
most people because they don't

4139.08 --> 4145.74
understand how the consequences changes

4142.56 --> 4148.47
those people it's very tough to

4145.74 --> 4150.929999999999
understand that you do see it often but

4148.47 --> 4155.900000000001
you don't understand why it's just very

4150.93 --> 4159.0
hard to understand such changes anyway

4155.9 --> 4161.549999999999
thanks everyone for coming I hope you
