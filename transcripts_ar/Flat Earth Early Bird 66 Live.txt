3.92 --> 11.46
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

7.649 --> 17.46
early-bird number 66 I'm your host

11.46 --> 23.189
Arwen and today's thing mixed weather

17.46 --> 25.32
day Sun and there's and there was even a

23.189 --> 28.789
rainbow for a moment there so it was

25.32 --> 33.69
interesting yeah also if you take a look

28.789 --> 36.45
at mashup subscriber counts it is now

33.69 --> 41.25
well and seems to be stable over a

36.45 --> 43.230000000000004
thousand so yeah it seems like it's

41.25 --> 49.17
finally there and it's staying there

43.23 --> 54.69
although yeah no guarantees but yeah it

49.17 --> 62.25
feels like a good day yeah it's not

54.69 --> 68.03
windy over here nice and mild so I see

62.25 --> 70.58
Nick and Chet mg42 pillbox Steve Voynich

68.03 --> 78.11
and Jeffrey bill

70.58 --> 82.15
Bertie Charlie hello guys so yeah whoosh

78.11 --> 85.22
I've been watching

82.15 --> 89.48
Owen Benjamin's latest dream that

85.22 --> 92.38
started six hours ago and I've been

89.48 --> 98.98
listening to the entire thing from

92.38 --> 103.44999999999999
beginning to end and was very impressed

98.98 --> 103.45
it's very very impressed it's

104.74 --> 114.82
this guy really delves into subjects and

108.88 --> 122.91999999999999
angles that I myself do also and he does

114.82 --> 126.15899999999999
it very eloquently and yeah I feel again

122.92 --> 130.42000000000002
I have to put my ego into it and say

126.159 --> 134.20000000000002
damn it he might be better than me this

130.42 --> 135.32999999999998
is not good I feel like I'm not good

134.2 --> 138.91
enough

135.33 --> 141.55
although yeah look the one Benjamin

138.91 --> 143.10999999999999
obviously does not dive into the details

141.55 --> 146.95000000000002
of cosmogony

143.11 --> 149.8
as much as I do and I do what I do and

146.95 --> 152.82999999999998
he's probably not as good at that but I

149.8 --> 154.78
was thinking and I also wrote a comment

152.83 --> 158.32000000000002
on that very hangout that I watched

154.78 --> 160.93
beginning to end saying yeah it would be

158.32 --> 165.34
super super awesome if I could be a

160.93 --> 168.66
guest on your show but in my mind he

165.34 --> 172.03
could also be a guest on my show if he

168.66 --> 175.93
thought that would be worthy I don't

172.03 --> 180.82
know he's an American guy obviously not

175.93 --> 184.12
a super super morning person has a

180.82 --> 187.42
really nice place with land and a fence

184.12 --> 188.92000000000002
that he's putting there apparently so I

187.42 --> 191.38
don't know if that's ever gonna happen

188.92 --> 194.04899999999998
but yeah that's one for the wishlist

191.38 --> 200.29
will be very interesting I really really

194.049 --> 204.37
liked the way he constantly put out the

200.29 --> 208.78
controlled opposition systems the as he

204.37 --> 214.78
calls it wizardry of how we are being

208.78 --> 218.5
taught certain things and then basically

214.78 --> 221.739
yeah an artificial counter response is

218.5 --> 224.769
induced because of that narrative so

221.739 --> 228.989
people are being almost obligated

224.769 --> 233.34
naturally to oppose the lies but

228.989 --> 236.26
unfortunately in doing so they overdo it

233.34 --> 238.209
naturally and this is for example the

236.26 --> 242.16899999999998
whole anti do thing and he went very

238.209 --> 245.59
very very deeply into that and that was

242.169 --> 246.91000000000003
pretty pretty well done I couldn't have

245.59 --> 252.19
done it better myself

246.91 --> 254.769
though yeah probably I'd be a bit more

252.19 --> 255.459
polite at it and that's obviously not

254.769 --> 258.1
his style

255.459 --> 261.01
it likes to just throw it out there and

258.1 --> 263.199
be as non politically correct as

261.01 --> 267.28
possible as long as it serves a purpose

263.199 --> 269.94
to him so he's not doing it for pure

267.28 --> 269.94
shock value

269.999 --> 279.899
and yeah was very impressed so yeah own

275.159 --> 283.519
Benjamin keep it up you know and I would

279.899 --> 288.569
really love to talk to you about about

283.519 --> 290.969
proving that global yours and getting a

288.569 --> 293.699
good look at what it really is and how

290.969 --> 295.769
it structurally has come into being and

293.699 --> 298.709
what is keeping it in its place the

295.769 --> 300.869
psychology of this and yeah that should

298.709 --> 304.589
be right down your alley since you seem

300.869 --> 306.959
to be very aware of the manipulations of

304.589 --> 310.649
controllers and social engineering on

306.959 --> 313.259
how to force us how to think without us

310.649 --> 317.059
being too conscious about it and yeah

313.259 --> 321.079
the globe is right down that alley so

317.059 --> 324.959
let's do this I hope you you keep tabs

321.079 --> 327.949
what's going on out there and keep tabs

324.959 --> 327.949
on my show as well

327.99 --> 330.71000000000004
so

331.589 --> 344.809
who then is L over McCall stone monkey

338.579 --> 344.809
3d ed um David Reed see you guys

352.199 --> 361.05
so yeah another funny thing since I did

356.33 --> 363.21
ask to be monetized and reported in for

361.05 --> 366.71000000000004
that being checked out guess what

363.21 --> 370.229
happened then after I streamed the

366.71 --> 373.59
yesterday's hangout flatters deliberate

370.229 --> 378.889
number 65 within half an hour

373.59 --> 383.849
I got a well not a strike we bought a

378.889 --> 386.969
copyright claim seriously right away

383.849 --> 389.639
it's not even monetized yet not really

386.969 --> 394.919
and I immediately got a copyright claim

389.639 --> 403.729
from a video that I played on suggestion

394.919 --> 406.889
of Jose and not the the one where the

403.729 --> 409.71
medics yeah basically made the song the

406.889 --> 411.33
flashy one but the other one that song

409.71 --> 413.99899999999997
was apparently copyrighted and then

411.33 --> 416.849
played for for two minutes

413.999 --> 420.41900000000004
and apparently that was enough to the

416.849 --> 422.039
flag it so I had to remove it I don't

420.419 --> 424.56
even know what it actually did but it

422.039 --> 425.159
just said okay you can remove this in

424.56 --> 427.949
the video

425.159 --> 429.839
apparently automatically so I did that I

427.949 --> 431.399
don't know if the song is still there or

429.839 --> 433.949
whatever really happened I didn't even

431.399 --> 437.779
check it but yeah the video is still

433.949 --> 440.779
there and it's alright now I guess so

437.779 --> 440.779
stuff

450.33 --> 456.8
okay that's new

452.9 --> 461.23999999999995
EDM says Adam green slaughter - and

456.8 --> 463.54
Troyer and Infowars really how about

461.24 --> 463.54
what

465.58 --> 470.5
yeah and and thanks everyone again for

468.37 --> 473.62
helping me reach the side thousand

470.5 --> 475.3
subscribers it's been a long-term goal

473.62 --> 478.6
I've been talking about that for a long

475.3 --> 481.81
time even when I was still doing Flat

478.6 --> 483.67
Earth talks and its really good that

481.81 --> 485.74
I've reached it although yeah now I

483.67 --> 490.54
really do have to move on this is no

485.74 --> 498.67
longer a thing I can focus on move on go

490.54 --> 502.15000000000003
beyond and yeah let's let's get to those

498.67 --> 503.56
hundred thousand subscribers now it's

502.15 --> 510.07
probably gonna take a little longer

503.56 --> 514.3
though and I'll need something more to

510.07 --> 517.27
present than just me in this background

514.3 --> 521.56
and yeah I know still interesting I

517.27 --> 523.5699999999999
guess it's not gonna get me a hundred

521.56 --> 526.3599999999999
thousand subscribers I don't believe it

523.57 --> 528.4300000000001
would although maybe I'm mistaken maybe

526.36 --> 530.73
his it is actually meant to be and it's

528.43 --> 533.4699999999999
gonna happen anyway no matter what I do

530.73 --> 534.76
except for not doing anything you no

533.47 --> 536.5
longer appearing online that's never

534.76 --> 537.97
gonna help me get a hundred thousand

536.5 --> 540.97
subscribers so I don't plan on doing

537.97 --> 547.98
that definitely plan on keeping going

540.97 --> 547.98
and we'll see how far I can bring this

550.07 --> 559.779
that I was featured on champagne the

552.829 --> 559.779
show really good

564.98 --> 572.0
I guess that since Nathan's no longer

569.96 --> 574.88
here to have the flare debates every

572.0 --> 577.49
single day the the lightning the baller

574.88 --> 581.86
lightning rod since he seems to be gone

577.49 --> 586.46
now for an unforeseen amount of time I

581.86 --> 590.15
guess I am the substitute for that

586.46 --> 594.2900000000001
so the ballers will yeah tend to try to

590.15 --> 596.6899999999999
get some angle on me and hope yeah I bet

594.29 --> 600.0999999999999
they hope I'll just latch onto that and

596.69 --> 602.87
start to do the whole Riley thing and

600.1 --> 607.51
talk about ballers every day oh look at

602.87 --> 607.51
him how he lied and also it disingenuous

608.26 --> 614.6899999999999
sorry like you do what you do Riley

612.83 --> 617.12
you're good at it it's just not my

614.69 --> 618.44
personal thing I've I've always found it

617.12 --> 620.51
kind of a waste of time

618.44 --> 622.5200000000001
although it technically isn't really

620.51 --> 628.31
because calling them out for Liars that

622.52 --> 631.55
they are is good should be done but it's

628.31 --> 633.77
just not something that I can invest a

631.55 --> 636.67
lot of energy on I prefer to just stick

633.77 --> 636.67
to the subjects

637.5 --> 643.66
thinking about things that haven't been

640.99 --> 645.67
thought before and yeah you're gonna go

643.66 --> 649.38
towards the ballers you're never gonna

645.67 --> 652.7199999999999
find any of that it's all recycled crap

649.38 --> 658.48
and recycled over and over again same

652.72 --> 660.25
questions same responses so there's not

658.48 --> 672.96
a lot of new things you're gonna find it

660.25 --> 672.96
baller hangouts really if ever know

675.0 --> 683.639
I don't think beyond practical example I

678.029 --> 687.899
don't think Jim is a predator you know a

683.639 --> 690.6
lot of these people might be one way or

687.899 --> 694.829
the other but until there's some actual

690.6 --> 699.509
solid proof of this I'm not gonna resort

694.829 --> 702.12
to yeah smearing people with these kind

699.509 --> 706.7090000000001
of things when it's not really relevant

702.12 --> 710.79
to the scenario that we are part of the

706.709 --> 712.8599999999999
flat earth and the ball earth debates

710.79 --> 716.0999999999999
it's not really relevant to that at all

712.86 --> 718.8000000000001
so I preferred not to resort to those

716.1 --> 721.589
kind of insults it's just a waste of

718.8 --> 723.5999999999999
time in my opinion until somebody is

721.589 --> 734.87
actually caught yeah okay that it's

723.6 --> 739.769
gonna be big news absolutely they did

734.87 --> 741.9590000000001
tell them okay oh that's nice yeah also

739.769 --> 745.589
I do find it kind of remarkable that a

741.959 --> 751.199
lot of ballers have been actually been

745.589 --> 753.629
kind of nice to me and try to like help

751.199 --> 754.68
me out with my channel so I really do

753.629 --> 758.309
appreciate that

754.68 --> 761.3389999999999
even though yeah the people doing that I

758.309 --> 762.059
might not actually like them as a person

761.339 --> 765.3000000000001
at all

762.059 --> 768.6
I still do appreciate that you would at

765.3 --> 771.209
least help support me in this engagement

768.6 --> 772.5690000000001
of building a YouTube channel and trying

771.209 --> 776.329
to

772.569 --> 779.389
yeah modestly try to start up a living

776.329 --> 782.4989999999999
from this angle in a way so yeah I

779.389 --> 787.639
appreciate that at least thank you for

782.499 --> 795.1700000000001
not being totally nasty - yeah - the

787.639 --> 798.04
maximum level as it were that says hey

795.17 --> 798.04
they had a meeting

808.2 --> 814.26
still waiting for Constance to to join

813.839 --> 818.5790000000001
me

814.26 --> 821.22
oh and Allenby is asking - to join as

818.579 --> 823.649
well I might entertain him for the

821.22 --> 828.029
moment since everybody else seems to not

823.649 --> 830.75
be here well guess I'll do that but yeah

828.029 --> 834.449
it's getting too goofy I'm just gonna

830.75 --> 837.36
and that so yeah you got the link

834.449 --> 840.5889999999999
Allenby let's see what you got to bring

837.36 --> 840.589
to the table

843.13 --> 848.649
it's kind of funny isn't it because if

845.589 --> 851.589
you look this picture right here it is

848.649 --> 855.91
kind of a table isn't it the table of

851.589 --> 857.5600000000001
our Earthrealm looping as it may be it

855.91 --> 862.56
is kind of a table and we're sitting

857.56 --> 862.56
right over it table the earth

886.02 --> 900.91
uh-oh look at that I can see the moon

892.17 --> 905.62
right there that's funny all time look

900.91 --> 910.35
at that way didn't see anything you see

905.62 --> 913.779
the moon I can see it it's right there

910.35 --> 917.49
Happy New Year Arwen hey Happy New Year

913.779 --> 921.33
can you see the moon no on my camera

917.49 --> 921.33
hangouts right in the middle

929.81 --> 933.43
you see it

931.58 --> 937.38
yep

933.43 --> 937.38
funny it's like half a moon

938.28 --> 945.6899999999999
it's always so odd when you see the moon

940.29 --> 947.6999999999999
during the daytime so you finally got to

945.69 --> 953.22
a thousand people what next

947.7 --> 954.8100000000001
yeah well next is gonna be yeah wherever

953.22 --> 956.97
that goes well first I have to get

954.81 --> 959.55
through the whole monetization process

956.97 --> 961.89
and just get used to this there's new

959.55 --> 965.28
way of dealing with things because

961.89 --> 967.23
before I was pretty loose and I just try

965.28 --> 969.06
anything now have to even be more

967.23 --> 971.6700000000001
careful I guess although I was already

969.06 --> 974.8499999999999
kind of careful with like presenting

971.67 --> 976.3199999999999
things with songs and everything now if

974.85 --> 979.1700000000001
you have to just pay a little bit more

976.32 --> 980.9100000000001
attention to that is that what you want

979.17 --> 983.9399999999999
to do you want to make make money doing

980.91 --> 989.9699999999999
this yeah absolutely

983.94 --> 995.2800000000001
a lot of work well hasn't it been a lot

989.97 --> 998.97
of work anyway you know don't know you

995.28 --> 1003.77
you um when you got angry I think there

998.97 --> 1007.4
was quite a lot of truth in what you

1003.77 --> 1010.43
were saying you know the question in you

1007.4 --> 1013.55
know was it is it all worth it is it

1010.43 --> 1016.25
worth the amount of work you know it's

1013.55 --> 1018.7099999999999
quite difficult to even consider doing

1016.25 --> 1020.81
one hour a day you know

1018.71 --> 1023.9000000000001
most TV productions would have probably

1020.81 --> 1026.21
have a staff of 3040 people working on

1023.9 --> 1028.6399999999999
that so one person it's called torture

1026.21 --> 1031.19
which other pens on the reason for that

1028.64 --> 1034.0400000000002
program to exist influences that it's

1031.19 --> 1036.41
supposed to exert the more influences

1034.04 --> 1039.59
this first exert the bigger the team

1036.41 --> 1042.44
will be to create the sophisticated

1039.59 --> 1044.1799999999998
programming so I don't have a team like

1042.44 --> 1046.49
that it's just me

1044.18 --> 1050.3300000000002
I mean people that I trust in the moment

1046.49 --> 1052.34
and that's what I use so but the whole

1050.33 --> 1056.6899999999998
problem about is it worth it that's

1052.34 --> 1060.3899999999999
mostly look it is worth doing this I

1056.69 --> 1063.01
like talking about

1060.39 --> 1066.3090000000002
society about alternative history about

1063.01 --> 1069.309
the the shape of the world all of that

1066.309 --> 1071.559
the issue that I addressed back then is

1069.309 --> 1076.47
not as much is it worth talking about it

1071.559 --> 1080.6499999999999
but is it worth doing all that and not

1076.47 --> 1082.57
making a living basically because I

1080.65 --> 1085.5400000000002
spend all the time all the energy all

1082.57 --> 1089.62
the focus and if I wouldn't get anything

1085.54 --> 1092.44
for it in return then yeah where is it

1089.62 --> 1094.809
gonna make me end up nowhere exactly the

1092.44 --> 1096.91
place I started with a little bit more

1094.809 --> 1100.51
knowledge maybe a couple of more friends

1096.91 --> 1103.059
maybe even a little Fame but I'm gonna

1100.51 --> 1105.4
stay in the same format pretty much and

1103.059 --> 1108.16
I don't want that I don't want to stay

1105.4 --> 1110.6200000000001
stuck in this freaking room if you know

1108.16 --> 1113.2900000000002
what so that's what that was about

1110.62 --> 1116.26
because doing this the actual things

1113.29 --> 1119.559
that I am doing that that is drawing in

1116.26 --> 1122.26
the crowds or the crowd or the few

1119.559 --> 1122.6789999999999
individuals that is actually worth it to

1122.26 --> 1124.45
me

1122.679 --> 1127.8090000000002
always has been otherwise it wouldn't

1124.45 --> 1129.82
have started doing that you thought

1127.809 --> 1136.049
about what topics and where you're gonna

1129.82 --> 1136.049
take it well

1136.85 --> 1143.87
I'm gonna take it wherever it goes

1139.91 --> 1146.8100000000002
really it all depends on who I'm gonna

1143.87 --> 1150.08
be faced with and how much of a

1146.81 --> 1154.22
challenge they have to oppose me with

1150.08 --> 1156.58
look I can dig into the very fine

1154.22 --> 1161.48
details of cosmogony

1156.58 --> 1164.72
and basically yeah continue what I've

1161.48 --> 1167.69
been doing in that sense or I could go

1164.72 --> 1170.6000000000001
in further much further with the

1167.69 --> 1172.7
alternative history and to be fair at

1170.6 --> 1178.6599999999999
this moment it seems there's a lot more

1172.7 --> 1181.52
tie-in with that it's almost almost like

1178.66 --> 1183.71
the controllers the elites that is

1181.52 --> 1187.01
seeing this spring up naturally in

1183.71 --> 1191.18
society is saying yeah you know what

1187.01 --> 1193.25
I guess we're kind of fine if it's

1191.18 --> 1196.39
revealed that the entire history have

1193.25 --> 1199.79
been light I think that is preferable

1196.39 --> 1202.8200000000002
then actually refueling that the globe

1199.79 --> 1206.1499999999999
is a lie so I feel like it's being

1202.82 --> 1208.82
secretly artificially stimulated and not

1206.15 --> 1211.73
countered as much in comparison to Flat

1208.82 --> 1215.84
Earth which is still ridiculed by

1211.73 --> 1218.3600000000001
default still while mud floods and such

1215.84 --> 1222.32
it's like you know rewards what is this

1218.36 --> 1228.61
or nonsense not but it's not as opposed

1222.32 --> 1232.6789999999999
as brutally and yeah I think that

1228.61 --> 1236.289
it could actually overtake the

1232.679 --> 1239.0800000000002
development stage of the of the common

1236.289 --> 1242.14
folk over flat earth that that's gonna

1239.08 --> 1245.71
progress first and then it might fall

1242.14 --> 1248.26
back again to the flat earth versus

1245.71 --> 1251.289
globe situation because that was also

1248.26 --> 1254.26
part of the entire history rearrangement

1251.289 --> 1256.33
so it'll get back you know you can go

1254.26 --> 1258.549
wherever you like but you're always

1256.33 --> 1260.97
gonna end up with flat earth it's always

1258.549 --> 1260.97
gonna happen

1261.929 --> 1268.8990000000001
hello hey flip snow hello shout out to

1266.679 --> 1271.179

1289.57 --> 1293.4089999999999
donate to me through my paypal some

1291.88 --> 1297.13
people have already done this and I'm

1293.409 --> 1301.63
very happy about it it really helps me a

1297.13 --> 1305.769
lot a lot it really does because yeah

1301.63 --> 1307.72
financially I am NOT let's get the

1305.769 --> 1309.389
racist for a moment okay I'm not a Jew

1307.72 --> 1313.48
when it comes to money

1309.389 --> 1316.08
I'm just not I was a bit unnecessary

1313.48 --> 1320.47
Owen yeah that's why I gave a warning

1316.08 --> 1323.649
okay but yet these but look the Jewish

1320.47 --> 1327.669
culture prize itself of being masters of

1323.649 --> 1329.62
money okay they pride themselves so I'm

1327.669 --> 1332.49
just not that good at it and I'm kind of

1329.62 --> 1336.549
annoyed that I'm not that good at it I

1332.49 --> 1339.19
used to have quite well I think now is a

1336.549 --> 1341.71
huge amount of money it's not really on

1339.19 --> 1343.539
the grander scale and I just didn't know

1341.71 --> 1347.08
how to spend it properly and that

1343.539 --> 1349.75
basically made it all evaporate with

1347.08 --> 1354.1899999999998
only a few artifacts remaining from that

1349.75 --> 1356.5
period and I've got nothing so I yeah

1354.19 --> 1359.1390000000001
I'm not that great with money but I plan

1356.5 --> 1361.99
to be a lot better than I used to be so

1359.139 --> 1364.57
any donations that anyone out there can

1361.99 --> 1367.029
give me that that they can miss because

1364.57 --> 1370.6899999999998
I don't want you to throw money at me

1367.029 --> 1372.909
that you you can afford to lose it would

1370.69 --> 1378.25
be really appreciated and I will use it

1372.909 --> 1383.0800000000002
and I will use it also to invest in for

1378.25 --> 1386.08
example clothing and yeah devices that

1383.08 --> 1388.809
can be used for research like a camera

1386.08 --> 1390.52
like a sit a pop filter yeah I know

1388.809 --> 1394.899
people been complaining about that a lot

1390.52 --> 1398.71
I will use it to buy some software like

1394.899 --> 1401.35
the proper devices required for audio

1398.71 --> 1403.6000000000001
banana to function so I get this noisy

1401.35 --> 1406.32
annoying sound out of the way for good

1403.6 --> 1410.799
and I am planning to give that priority

1406.32 --> 1415.33
as soon as well yet the real monthly

1410.799 --> 1417.6689999999999
money rolls in I will be able to afford

1415.33 --> 1419.799
that and I will do it because every time

1417.669 --> 1422.1000000000001
I listen back I hear that that noisy

1419.799 --> 1424.299
sound and it annoys the hell out of me

1422.1 --> 1428.59
probably even more than the average

1424.299 --> 1431.44
viewer so I want that fixed but I can't

1428.59 --> 1433.779
do it all for free and I still have to

1431.44 --> 1437.3500000000001
maintain myself I still have to pay rent

1433.779 --> 1440.649
I still have to get food and organic

1437.35 --> 1444.129
food so yeah I live tight I'm not rich

1440.649 --> 1446.799
at all I could be considered poor but

1444.129 --> 1450.12
yeah for somebody who is technically

1446.799 --> 1452.4089999999999
poor I do pretty damn well I believe I

1450.12 --> 1455.34
think it's gonna be a lot of hard work

1452.409 --> 1458.8890000000001
and uh I'm not sure that you understand

1455.34 --> 1461.11
how much hard work it's gonna be oh I

1458.889 --> 1462.549
think because if you ask somebody like

1461.11 --> 1465.01
Nathan and watching Mex

1462.549 --> 1467.5
he'll tell you he doesn't make a lot but

1465.01 --> 1471.7
one of the interesting I don't need to I

1467.5 --> 1475.809
don't I'm not suggesting that I will end

1471.7 --> 1477.8790000000001
up with like two thousand euros a month

1475.809 --> 1479.2
or something I'm not an idiot okay

1477.879 --> 1481.36
that's not gonna happen

1479.2 --> 1484.1200000000001
but that's what you know know these

1481.36 --> 1487.4189999999999
little bits these little bits make a

1484.12 --> 1490.1789999999999
huge huge difference for me because

1487.419 --> 1490.5400000000002
instead of constantly balancing on that

1490.179 --> 1493.96
fire

1490.54 --> 1496.6299999999999
financial line to not drop into huge

1493.96 --> 1500.2
amounts of debts all of a sudden this

1496.63 --> 1502.8100000000002
little little little surplus is freedom

1500.2 --> 1506.02
it is suddenly the the ability to escape

1502.81 --> 1508.6599999999999
from that baseline and that's why these

1506.02 --> 1510.67
little bits mean so much to me

1508.66 --> 1515.5600000000002
they really do more than the average

1510.67 --> 1518.2
person I think it helps a lot okay have

1515.56 --> 1522.6399999999999
you noticed that quite a few people who

1518.2 --> 1526.18
started off in that have moved away from

1522.64 --> 1528.76
that as a major topic have been more

1526.18 --> 1532.21
successful than people who continued to

1528.76 --> 1533.26
talk about just flat well I don't give a

1532.21 --> 1536.32
rat's ass

1533.26 --> 1539.44
I don't do it do I only talk about

1536.32 --> 1541.78
flutters but no that's not what that's

1539.44 --> 1544.45
not what I said I said have you noticed

1541.78 --> 1546.73
well I don't care because I feel that

1544.45 --> 1549.04
you're trying to insert again a nice

1546.73 --> 1550.96
suggestion of how Flat Earth is not

1549.04 --> 1552.01
really the way to go and if I want to

1550.96 --> 1553.93
stay afloat

1552.01 --> 1557.11
I probably better move away from Flat

1553.93 --> 1559.24
Earth it's not gonna work I think you're

1557.11 --> 1561.55
paranoid it was John I think I know you

1559.24 --> 1564.13
I've known you for a year and you always

1561.55 --> 1566.86
do this you're very sorry about it but

1564.13 --> 1569.3200000000002
not subtle enough I like a second

1566.86 --> 1571.1499999999999
opinion so what do we invite don't read

1569.32 --> 1573.4299999999998
or don't read very school I like to I

1571.15 --> 1575.6200000000001
like him speaking with us over here I'm

1573.43 --> 1578.41
not taking him I'm just immediately

1575.62 --> 1580.6899999999998
responding no no I say dawn dawn in the

1578.41 --> 1585.46
shad don't Ritter why don't we invite

1580.69 --> 1588.52
Don he's cool I mean real a new voice I

1585.46 --> 1590.5900000000001
like a refreshing voice it was in Del he

1588.52 --> 1593.26
was really respectful on his beam it's

1590.59 --> 1598.84
cool you know when you get it a dawn

1593.26 --> 1600.76
dawn yeah yeah yeah he's not gonna snap

1598.84 --> 1602.5
he's not gonna do [ __ ] yeah he's cool I

1600.76 --> 1604.6
think I'm just humming I haven't even

1602.5 --> 1606.07
asked him if you want to join but I'm

1604.6 --> 1607.81
just asking you because you're sure I'll

1606.07 --> 1612.25
like well here don't hear it be cool to

1607.81 --> 1617.8
talk dude it's on you yeah I think Don

1612.25 --> 1620.17
threader is right I don't think I want

1617.8 --> 1621.8799999999999
that right now I don't look this is not

1620.17 --> 1624.76
the baller show

1621.88 --> 1626.41
I'd love love to have discussions of

1624.76 --> 1628.39
course but no I think I think we could

1626.41 --> 1631.24
have a discussion we done not even

1628.39 --> 1633.0400000000002
related to flower here we have a four

1631.24 --> 1634.96
different perspective on things you know

1633.04 --> 1636.67
I'm he questioned things I hear him

1634.96 --> 1640.8700000000001
talking and I think he's alright

1636.67 --> 1642.13
somebody does my take on this on you why

1640.87 --> 1647.1399999999999
do you think Alan what do you think

1642.13 --> 1650.8300000000002
about done I like do well from what I

1647.14 --> 1653.1100000000001
remember I don't ya know know yeah I

1650.83 --> 1654.6399999999999
know I remember him back in the day from

1653.11 --> 1657.1299999999999
the Florida Bay he was a little bit of

1654.64 --> 1661.0
an ass but lately the way I only had

1657.13 --> 1664.3600000000001
slight in a rowdy months right yeah yeah

1661.0 --> 1667.66
but I think like lately it's very recent

1664.36 --> 1672.3
he was an ass very recently so I find

1667.66 --> 1672.3000000000002
this whole approach a little bit awkward

1672.36 --> 1677.32
but did you see bail like a few days ago

1675.61 --> 1681.82
he was on bail and he was really cool

1677.32 --> 1684.3899999999999
bail was they asked to him the del in

1681.82 --> 1689.76
the winter turn what do you expect

1684.39 --> 1692.98
so that's right buzzer courageous on

1689.76 --> 1696.79
that's what he does on every show in the

1692.98 --> 1699.97
winter mostly he actually does calm down

1696.79 --> 1701.95
during a summertime here now I just find

1699.97 --> 1704.65
all this shows the same I went to be

1701.95 --> 1706.63
onyx you know he could he could probably

1704.65 --> 1711.3700000000001
he could probably put a show on from

1706.63 --> 1715.15
five years ago and nobody knows I'd

1711.37 --> 1717.33
notice because he did change a lot he's

1715.15 --> 1720.19
a lot more fluid now and he doesn't have

1717.33 --> 1722.98
weird awkward moments as much it's very

1720.19 --> 1725.31
fluid what he does but yeah the things

1722.98 --> 1728.38
that he does are pretty much the same

1725.31 --> 1732.58
processes and I even confronted in with

1728.38 --> 1737.41
that oh you're never gonna change him no

1732.58 --> 1739.4499999999998
of course not but I can give him just

1737.41 --> 1743.1100000000001
tiny little bits of new

1739.45 --> 1746.53
that a new approaches new views that

1743.11 --> 1750.7299999999998
might over time eventually find a little

1746.53 --> 1754.33
place in his mind so yeah that's all you

1750.73 --> 1758.59
can do really tell does what Dell does

1754.33 --> 1760.36
and yeah it's not really my thing let's

1758.59 --> 1762.55
talk about a second about copyright

1760.36 --> 1764.62
strikes I wouldn't watch what video was

1762.55 --> 1766.81
that man I feel horrible

1764.62 --> 1770.9799999999998
one of the ones with the pew plate from

1766.81 --> 1774.94
me that I recommended you I think it was

1770.98 --> 1778.66
the second video that was that ship

1774.94 --> 1780.8500000000001
moving through the Mirage okay yeah

1778.66 --> 1784.45
because that was promised letters that

1780.85 --> 1786.3999999999999
yeah that that was from a different

1784.45 --> 1789.1000000000001
channel because the songs I put in my

1786.4 --> 1791.2900000000002
videos there those are from MIDI HC and

1789.1 --> 1792.9699999999998
these are personal you know his own

1791.29 --> 1794.86
songs and he's not gonna copyright

1792.97 --> 1796.99
strike us he gave me the green light to

1794.86 --> 1798.6699999999998
use him and he's not gonna for whatever

1796.99 --> 1801.64
I use in his for with it so he's the

1798.67 --> 1804.76
ones that clearly used that he compared

1801.64 --> 1808.1100000000001
compiled will compile my video and yeah

1804.76 --> 1808.11
we got screwed man sorry about that

1809.1 --> 1815.23
yeah well it's something now I have to

1812.46 --> 1817.75
learn to focus on because before I never

1815.23 --> 1819.94
got anything really never got a strike

1817.75 --> 1823.0
never even got the sing over mark in the

1819.94 --> 1825.24
last three years so this is new to me I

1823.0 --> 1829.09
guess it comes with the monetization and

1825.24 --> 1834.79
yeah as donk rather don't threader says

1829.09 --> 1837.97
in the chat patreon blah blah blah so

1834.79 --> 1840.43
I'm not relying on super chance I'm not

1837.97 --> 1845.05
I haven't even received any super check

1840.43 --> 1848.53
yet so no it's not relevant it's just

1845.05 --> 1851.05
another thing I thought earlier like

1848.53 --> 1856.059
that was would be the only way to do it

1851.05 --> 1860.84
but then yeah apparently using

1856.059 --> 1865.1
it's the name again yeah using PayPal

1860.84 --> 1867.6799999999998
works just fine so you can do that

1865.1 --> 1870.4099999999999
and who knows patreon I don't know I

1867.68 --> 1873.14
don't have a weird feeling about patreon

1870.41 --> 1875.8400000000001
but maybe yeah I will end up going there

1873.14 --> 1876.41
as well and who knows maybe in a year's

1875.84 --> 1879.74
time

1876.41 --> 1883.3700000000001
Arwen will be freaking everywhere on the

1879.74 --> 1885.5
internet every single ad form shouting a

1883.37 --> 1888.53
freaking Alex you should show do you

1885.5 --> 1889.82
need hate me please subscribe to me I

1888.53 --> 1892.01

1892.01 --> 1897.3799999999999
manatee can survive you know maybe

1895.28 --> 1899.6
that's gonna happen I don't know at this

1897.38 --> 1904.19
point I'm just doing it I'm doing right

1899.6 --> 1907.07
now and I like that hey shout-out to

1904.19 --> 1909.23
Pichet and his freakin conspirator mind

1907.07 --> 1910.8799999999999
if they don't promote agents and don't

1909.23 --> 1912.77
rate is one of the biggest agents

1910.88 --> 1914.69
whatever man I would like to talk to

1912.77 --> 1918.17
different people I don't care who's who

1914.69 --> 1920.179

1920.179 --> 1924.5300000000002
don't got to be are you crazy I have a

1922.4 --> 1926.9
good response to that and it's funny

1924.53 --> 1929.36
because Ellen B's right here you can

1926.9 --> 1930.77
hear it you know is it this it doesn't

1929.36 --> 1935.26
really matter if you're an agent the

1930.77 --> 1938.24
only thing that matters is the agenda

1935.26 --> 1939.74
when it is spoken and as long as you

1938.24 --> 1941.66
deal with that doesn't matter if you're

1939.74 --> 1944.51
surrounded by agents really as long as

1941.66 --> 1946.76
you know when they're manipulating you

1944.51 --> 1949.46
and there's nothing they can do to you

1946.76 --> 1951.61
you just call it out immediately call

1949.46 --> 1953.8700000000001
out the suggestion call out the

1951.61 --> 1956.809
multi-layer narrative that's being

1953.87 --> 1960.29
introduced all of that I just call it

1956.809 --> 1963.23
out immediately other mind he's here you

1960.29 --> 1965.8999999999999
know because I yeah I wouldn't be no

1963.23 --> 1969.71
offense but I really don't trust you I

1965.9 --> 1972.77
trust you not to be a dick I trust you

1969.71 --> 1975.47
not to porn bow me so please don't but I

1972.77 --> 1978.55
don't trust you as an intellectually

1975.47 --> 1981.55
honest person really not caught lately

1978.55 --> 1983.8999999999999
what saying goes for you that's fine

1981.55 --> 1986.86
it's your choice

1983.9 --> 1992.3500000000001
interestingly enough you using PayPal

1986.86 --> 1998.4499999999998
that was invented by Elon Musk goody

1992.35 --> 2001.539
yeah well you know if you really look

1998.45 --> 2003.909
back and you figure out how history

2001.539 --> 2006.9089999999999
really works you might figure out that

2003.909 --> 2010.21
every single thing you've ever thought

2006.909 --> 2014.95
of and used ever throughout the history

2010.21 --> 2018.309
has been created by nasty people every

2014.95 --> 2021.7
single thing every everything and it's

2018.309 --> 2026.9189999999999
become a habit for Humanity to create a

2021.7 --> 2029.1100000000001
nice cover story to to cover up the

2026.919 --> 2032.0200000000002
nastiness to make people feel better

2029.11 --> 2034.0
because that's just more functional than

2032.02 --> 2037.57
showing the complete reality of how

2034.0 --> 2041.1
nasty people just control the world and

2037.57 --> 2043.84
steer our society and develop it

2041.1 --> 2045.789
according to their will and their plan

2043.84 --> 2047.9499999999998
and there's really very little that we

2045.789 --> 2052.69
can do about it just yet except for

2047.95 --> 2055.2400000000002
awaken to it you know but you just think

2052.69 --> 2057.01
of all the statues out there think of

2055.24 --> 2060.9089999999997
all the statues of the historical

2057.01 --> 2064.389
figures try to find a single one single

2060.909 --> 2068.83
statue anywhere in the world of a person

2064.389 --> 2073.089
that was not a total dick or a murderer

2068.83 --> 2075.669
or a racist of some kind or some kind of

2073.089 --> 2079.359
Loony in a way you know their whole

2075.669 --> 2082.1189999999997
every single one of them not a decent

2079.359 --> 2084.73
person among them not a single one it's

2082.119 --> 2088.06
just impossible doesn't happen up to the

2084.73 --> 2091.27
Abraham Lincoln statue do you think that

2088.06 --> 2093.7
he was perfectly fine no sorry now this

2091.27 --> 2096.22
is saying just saying you know there's

2093.7 --> 2098.14
good things about them and we need those

2096.22 --> 2100.8999999999996
good things we need those good things to

2098.14 --> 2102.91
be inspirations to us to be to let the

2100.9 --> 2107.26
good things be an example to shape us

2102.91 --> 2110.19
but there will always be dark bad things

2107.26 --> 2114.1600000000003
alongside of it every single time you

2110.19 --> 2116.23
know and you got it if you really want

2114.16 --> 2119.0499999999997
to grow if you really want to understand

2116.23 --> 2121.75
the nature of those good things then you

2119.05 --> 2124.2400000000002
have to see the dark side of it as well

2121.75 --> 2127.89
to understand how it is coming into

2124.24 --> 2131.859
being and that's where you really learn

2127.89 --> 2134.3399999999997
you've got to see the bad to understand

2131.859 --> 2134.34
the good

2137.33 --> 2143.0
when you got a request a shout out from

2139.55 --> 2146.0600000000004
peanuts read the shed and shut up yeah

2143.0 --> 2150.89
shout out to the mud flood hey yeah boom

2146.06 --> 2156.2
Flair's yeah it's a fascinating subject

2150.89 --> 2160.39
I you know I wit I think thinking of

2156.2 --> 2165.5
trying to make put together kind of a

2160.39 --> 2167.87
videography slideshow to show my to

2165.5 --> 2170.63
share my theory about how the mud flump

2167.87 --> 2174.17
changed everything and how the royalty

2170.63 --> 2175.9700000000003
conspired against the victims of the mud

2174.17 --> 2177.5
flood to found their kingdoms and

2175.97 --> 2179.8999999999996
rearranged history and everything

2177.5 --> 2182.33
because there are a lot of paintings and

2179.9 --> 2185.15
pictures of these eras so there is so

2182.33 --> 2187.58
much material to work with if I'd get

2185.15 --> 2189.35
like a library of like thousands of

2187.58 --> 2190.85
these paintings and pictures and maybe

2189.35 --> 2192.83
even some writings here and there I

2190.85 --> 2194.9
could probably put together really

2192.83 --> 2198.56
fascinating flight slideshow kind of

2194.9 --> 2201.71
similar to Martin Lita's work but with a

2198.56 --> 2205.63
actual storyline going through them to

2201.71 --> 2209.12
explain how I think things really happen

2205.63 --> 2211.7000000000003
it's a plan and look like every time I

2209.12 --> 2214.19
bring forth one of these brick yeah

2211.7 --> 2216.5299999999997
these great plans okay it's me Arwen

2214.19 --> 2218.93
unfortunately when I have a great plan

2216.53 --> 2220.8500000000004
there's only like 25 percent I'm

2218.93 --> 2223.37
actually gonna do it and if I'm gonna do

2220.85 --> 2226.04
it it's probably gonna take too long

2223.37 --> 2229.73
before it actually gets there so don't

2226.04 --> 2232.13
get your hopes up for a quick put out of

2229.73 --> 2234.71
this idea I'll probably need some

2232.13 --> 2237.5
reliable research I need to know where

2234.71 --> 2242.87
to get all this all these pictures all

2237.5 --> 2244.58
these paintings and yeah because I'm if

2242.87 --> 2247.43
I just google it I'll probably end up

2244.58 --> 2250.67
with pretty crappy quality and I need

2247.43 --> 2252.47
some sources and if somebody can help me

2250.67 --> 2255.32
with that maybe Martin would be willing

2252.47 --> 2257.18
to share some of his sources with me or

2255.32 --> 2259.79
maybe other people out there contact me

2257.18 --> 2263.5299999999997
on skype and yeah help me out give me

2259.79 --> 2265.97
some good sources for this era for the

2263.53 --> 2269.21
the early Renaissance into the

2265.97 --> 2273.62
industrialization with paintings and

2269.21 --> 2275.51
photographs and yeah especially relating

2273.62 --> 2277.94
to things like Star Wars and you're not

2275.51 --> 2280.7900000000004
flood I got I got two more important

2277.94 --> 2282.92
shoutouts one to undersea shutter:200 a

2280.79 --> 2284.87
Z a shout-out to Chocola same shara to

2282.92 --> 2287.6
Batman and the statue of the Dark Knight

Rises boom oh they are considering

2287.6 --> 2293.48
grooming Sandler

2290.29 --> 2296.0299999999997

2293.48 --> 2298.4900000000002

I got no money I had no money for gas I

2298.49 --> 2302.4799999999996

rather spend a little bit of money I had

2302.48 --> 2312.68
to eat and I didn't do it so sorry yeah

2310.16 --> 2314.81

2312.68 --> 2319.1299999999997

2314.81 --> 2320.5099999999998

2577.43 --> 2585.3999999999996
thanks for sharing that so appreciate it

2581.41 --> 2585.3999999999996
yeah I lost a subscriber

2587.93 --> 2593.37
now it's not gonna leave the four-digit

2591.87 --> 2603.5899999999997
number anytime soon I think

2593.37 --> 2607.98
I feel so anything other to talk about

2603.59 --> 2609.75
Alan did you have any questions or some

2607.98 --> 2611.79
kind of subject you wanted to bring my

2609.75 --> 2612.99
attention to or just I would just think

2611.79 --> 2613.62
about where you're going to take the

2612.99 --> 2616.02
show

2613.62 --> 2617.7
what you wanted to do are you gonna make

2616.02 --> 2627.09
it successful what you've been thinking

2617.7 --> 2629.0099999999998
about right well yeah I'm just gonna

2627.09 --> 2634.8500000000004
keep on doing what i doing what I'm

2629.01 --> 2639.3300000000004
doing but I might also yeah

2634.85 --> 2641.88
slightly get more involved just touch

2639.33 --> 2644.46
upon we have geopolitical situations

2641.88 --> 2646.7400000000002
because there is so much happening and

2644.46 --> 2651.03
it's very interesting to approach all

2646.74 --> 2653.79
these things from a deeper multi-level

2651.03 --> 2656.28
narrative perspective because yeah when

2653.79 --> 2658.5
you actually watch the news from

2656.28 --> 2663.4500000000003
whatever channel you're not gonna get

2658.5 --> 2666.87
that toll to you so and for me it's very

2663.45 --> 2670.3199999999997
easy to see every time with every news

2666.87 --> 2672.48
article from whatever source to see what

2670.32 --> 2675.15
the direction is they're taking what the

2672.48 --> 2676.95
narrative is they're following and what

2675.15 --> 2679.7400000000002
they're basically with that trying to

2676.95 --> 2683.3399999999997
suggest and that gives me kind of a yeah

2679.74 --> 2686.37
a view of the paths that are happening

2683.34 --> 2688.29
through our time and which path is

2686.37 --> 2691.83
overtaking which one which one is dying

2688.29 --> 2694.38
down and is there yeah sometimes things

2691.83 --> 2698.25
break down a neuter narrative can be

2694.38 --> 2701.2200000000003
formed or merged even and this is very

2698.25 --> 2703.29
interesting and yeah one of these

2701.22 --> 2705.0
examples for me although I have no

2703.29 --> 2707.34
absolute confirmation that it will

2705.0 --> 2710.46
continue on into the future is Owen

2707.34 --> 2713.88
Benjamin getting involved with Infowars

2710.46 --> 2716.43
more directly yet talking so openly

2713.88 --> 2719.15
about Flat Earth in the way he does in

2716.43 --> 2722.39
the right way and that is a

2719.15 --> 2727.88
sign that there may indeed be some kind

2722.39 --> 2733.04
of middle road narrative merger that is

2727.88 --> 2736.2200000000003
approaching like an alliance a flat

2733.04 --> 2739.79
earth Infowars libertarianism the

2736.22 --> 2742.1299999999997
counter autocracy yeah it is a match

2739.79 --> 2743.99
I've been actually saying that for three

2742.13 --> 2746.09
years it's only because Alex Jones

2743.99 --> 2748.6099999999997
freakin loves his globe in outer space

2746.09 --> 2751.9700000000003
so much that's basically become almost

2748.61 --> 2755.15
impossible but other than that yeah we

2751.97 --> 2757.0099999999998
are a an alliance made in heaven just

2755.15 --> 2760.34
have to get there we have to get over

2757.01 --> 2762.5
those details all of us from our from

2760.34 --> 2765.77
the flatter side and from the infowar

2762.5 --> 2769.76
side and yeah then again there's also

2765.77 --> 2772.07
the the problem with the entire Infowars

2769.76 --> 2775.25
movement is that they are trying to a

2772.07 --> 2778.76
more and more for a relatively low

2775.25 --> 2782.9
intellectual people to get them at least

2778.76 --> 2787.94
involved somehow to use them as I guess

2782.9 --> 2790.03
intellectual shock troops to to get this

2787.94 --> 2793.76
thing going to get the awakening going

2790.03 --> 2796.8100000000004
well we seem to be directing our

2793.76 --> 2801.61
attention to a totally different type of

2796.81 --> 2805.85
group of people that are much more

2801.61 --> 2809.27
anarchists spirited in nature that are

2805.85 --> 2811.97
more outside of society that that'll go

2809.27 --> 2815.6
that extra mile that everybody just says

2811.97 --> 2817.52
okay no way that's I'm going up to here

2815.6 --> 2818.8399999999997
and no further and I don't trust you

2817.52 --> 2821.35
anymore that kind of response

2818.84 --> 2825.08
a lot of flatterers have been receiving

2821.35 --> 2828.95
but yeah despite this heavy contrast in

2825.08 --> 2832.94
character average in these narratives it

2828.95 --> 2835.27
can still work together if we actively

2832.94 --> 2839.84
make peace both sides

2835.27 --> 2843.74
it can happen and we'd be very strong

2839.84 --> 2847.46
we'd be stronger for it but he doesn't

2843.74 --> 2849.97
mean you know that's what he thinks he

2847.46 --> 2857.38
doesn't need me for his own

2849.97 --> 2858.5789999999997
money ambitions basically but yeah he

2857.38 --> 2862.619
does need us

2858.579 --> 2866.2000000000003
he needs everyone as we do need everyone

2862.619 --> 2868.78
the deep state the controllers the the

2866.2 --> 2872.609
real evil ones the ones that really are

2868.78 --> 2876.4300000000003
nasty they oppose us all all of us any

2872.609 --> 2881.2599999999998
level of individualist any they're all

2876.43 --> 2886.0499999999997
our enemies these people all of us I

2881.26 --> 2888.28
think this is all just ego based

2886.05 --> 2890.1090000000004
short-sighted infighting basically at

2888.28 --> 2893.44
this point because we have a shared

2890.109 --> 2895.0299999999997
enemy and we need to band together dig

2893.44 --> 2898.9
to overcome it

2895.03 --> 2900.28
we can let me jump England right big

2898.9 --> 2901.839
shout-out Thank You state for

2900.28 --> 2906.28
subscribing to me I subscribe back to

2901.839 --> 2908.38
you thank you right I think the mistake

2906.28 --> 2910.63
in making our when I see you imagine

2908.38 --> 2913.359
that there within the conspiratorial

2910.63 --> 2916.63
mind there's some kind of community and

2913.359 --> 2920.2
I think you'll find that there isn't no

2916.63 --> 2929.109
there is it is that it is the necessity

2920.2 --> 2932.89
of met maintaining a possibility of

2929.109 --> 2936.5789999999997
advanced individualism that makes sense

2932.89 --> 2940.089
and that is truth based not the not the

2936.579 --> 2942.28
right to be as ludicrous insane and

2940.089 --> 2945.22
lying and vile and disgusting as

2942.28 --> 2950.05
possible but the right to speak the

2945.22 --> 2956.77
truth and to gather strength from within

2950.05 --> 2958.9
and to make a positive change that that

2956.77 --> 2960.849
is what we really share that is the

2958.9 --> 2962.65
objective that we really share in all

2960.849 --> 2964.9300000000003
these movements and that is the

2962.65 --> 2967.869
important part about it not the details

2964.93 --> 2969.7
it is that it is the spirit the spirit

2967.869 --> 2971.4700000000003
of truth the spirit of Liberty the

2969.7 --> 2975.6699999999996
Spirit of Christ the

2971.47 --> 2978.5989999999997
path the method of the path that is the

2975.67 --> 2981.88
real core of it all

2978.599 --> 2984.369
so dr. Karen being said lovely Karen be

2981.88 --> 2985.27
and shout out to let me ask femurs why

2984.369 --> 2990.76
banana curds

thank you do you think I'm Alex will

2990.76 --> 2996.67
survive this Sunday hook court case why

2994.27 --> 2998.89
are you talking about he's in court over

2996.67 --> 3003.06
what he said about Sunday book that's

2998.89 --> 3004.02
old news it was it was a complete farce

3003.06 --> 3006.9
the whole thing

3004.02 --> 3010.4
he was basically being extremely over

3006.9 --> 3013.89
apologetic when there was absolutely no

3010.4 --> 3017.9700000000003
sensible proof of anything against him

3013.89 --> 3021.96
isn't go over it now no he's not that's

3017.97 --> 3024.2999999999997
it that's done it's done no it's know

3021.96 --> 3025.98
you've refute it pretty much everything

3024.3 --> 3029.67
there's still a long term process is

3025.98 --> 3033.75
going on but you owe me you owe me boom

3029.67 --> 3036.48
boom boom Oh complete [ __ ] anyway oh

3033.75 --> 3038.91
and you should have just said yeah it

3036.48 --> 3039.51
didn't happen when people are actor here

3038.91 --> 3041.94
are liars

3039.51 --> 3043.7700000000004
you're disgusting people that's what he

3041.94 --> 3047.4
should have said Owen is just being

3043.77 --> 3049.8
subpoenaed for all these records he

3047.4 --> 3050.82
subpoenaed for everything he's ever done

3049.8 --> 3054.27
okay

3050.82 --> 3056.07
just like Trump so doesn't mean anything

3054.27 --> 3058.56
doesn't mean that he is actually a bad

3056.07 --> 3060.51
individual at all just means he's being

3058.56 --> 3068.369
attacked because he is a serious threat

3060.51 --> 3072.57
and he is you think so yes he is a

3068.369 --> 3076.05
threat to the false flag concept he's a

3072.57 --> 3078.3
threat to the statist narrative he's a

3076.05 --> 3081.69
threat to the neocons the neoliberal

3078.3 --> 3083.9900000000002
she's the threat to the entire true evil

3081.69 --> 3088.44
New World Order control system he is

3083.99 --> 3091.52
he's not perfect absolutely not and he's

3088.44 --> 3094.98
actually went into a direction that I

3091.52 --> 3097.98
that I find repulsive in a way it's his

3094.98 --> 3100.95
freakin choice and he will bear the

3097.98 --> 3104.13
fruits of that in all directions yeah he

3100.95 --> 3108.5899999999997
will be wealthy but he will also

3104.13 --> 3112.17
not yeah he will not be as respected

3108.59 --> 3115.23
because of it but he's still doing what

3112.17 --> 3117.96
he does and he still is maintaining that

3115.23 --> 3119.61
position within the framework of the

3117.96 --> 3124.29
entire resistance against the

3119.61 --> 3127.05
controllers so he will be attacked and

3124.29 --> 3130.5
he's gonna stay like that he's will be

3127.05 --> 3132.4500000000003
attacked until everything breaks or he

3130.5 --> 3136.46
just can't handle it anymore and he has

3132.45 --> 3136.46
to retreat that's what's gonna happen

3146.54 --> 3149.92
Oh silence

3151.73 --> 3158.119
yeah but you got to realize like this

3154.67 --> 3162.77
alex jones guy he's been at it for 20

3158.119 --> 3166.099
years okay and I followed him more than

3162.77 --> 3169.52
half of that time so I've seen him

3166.099 --> 3173.6600000000003
develop grow make choices unspoken

3169.52 --> 3177.28
choices by his acts I've seen the

3173.66 --> 3182.71
choices that he made as he made them on

3177.28 --> 3182.71
life just as he changed I saw it and

3185.56 --> 3193.04
it's just what it is but he's still

3188.24 --> 3195.5789999999997
doing what he does and it still has a

3193.04 --> 3200.45
function but yeah he has definitely

3195.579 --> 3203.78
directed his attention to a lower class

3200.45 --> 3207.23
people intellectually you know I almost

3203.78 --> 3209.3900000000003
feel bad for saying it it's just they're

3207.23 --> 3212.869
not all stupid it's just there's a lot

3209.39 --> 3215.27
of people out there that really are

3212.869 --> 3217.67
looking to make a difference but don't

3215.27 --> 3221.48
have all the mental tools to do it and

3217.67 --> 3223.94
these people are desperate to contribute

3221.48 --> 3226.19
to the resistance against the true evil

3223.94 --> 3229.88
which they can at least feel is there

3226.19 --> 3235.46
okay they can feel it's real and yeah he

3229.88 --> 3236.7200000000003
is giving them something to do that kind

3235.46 --> 3239.089
of does help

3236.72 --> 3240.77
although yeah it is kind of messy here

3239.089 --> 3243.89
in there there's always things always

3240.77 --> 3246.29
get messy when you get the not super

3243.89 --> 3249.5299999999997
bright people involved in political

3246.29 --> 3254.47
situations but it is doing something I

3249.53 --> 3254.4700000000003
don't think it's bad still I don't

haven't watched your channel in a while

3503.09 --> 3508.4300000000003
because every time I do instead of just

3505.76 --> 3512.3300000000004
learning about the Bible I learn about

3508.43 --> 3514.91
how in how socially inept you are and

3512.33 --> 3519.02
I'm sick of it and I'm sick of your

3531.76 --> 3537.1600000000003
okay let's give the show the show

3535.48 --> 3543.19

from P Mars server about that so he

3557.29 --> 3562.48
needs support let's invite him in now oh

3560.73 --> 3566.23
I'll keep trying

3562.48 --> 3568.63
yeah sure this school man I like to chat

3566.23 --> 3570.01
with him he got a different view on he

3568.63 --> 3572.2000000000003
said like yeah it's a sphere because I

3570.01 --> 3574.03
believe the accent actually accepts he

3572.2 --> 3575.62
said believe you know not much to prove

3574.03 --> 3577.2400000000002
oh but I like to hear him from the

3575.62 --> 3581.7999999999997
horse's mouth you know what's his take

3577.24 --> 3583.75
on all these flatter [ __ ] right I

3581.8 --> 3586.21
think that Dawn Treader from what I've

3583.75 --> 3589.03
heard from him from the Flat Earth

3586.21 --> 3594.7
debates he is really religious about the

3589.03 --> 3597.07
ball and every time it's tested then his

3594.7 --> 3600.3399999999997
critical thinking skills tend to die

3597.07 --> 3604.9300000000003
down get shut off and he refers to more

3600.34 --> 3609.25
typical lower intellectual processes

3604.93 --> 3613.4199999999996
really so I know maybe he has developed

3609.25 --> 3616.44
now somewhat want me to send him there

3613.42 --> 3620.14
hang out no no no okay

3616.44 --> 3624.13

but for now my show is still going so

3665.15 --> 3672.81
confused by the whole Paula situation so

3669.72 --> 3676.4399999999996
what you up 2012 yeah

3672.81 --> 3681.57

3681.57 --> 3686.4300000000003

yeah it's one of mine so I took I got

3696.51 --> 3702.2700000000004
two long videos part 1 2 & 3 actually

3699.33 --> 3705.089
part 1 it's like 25 minutes part two is

3702.27 --> 3709.41
like 15 minutes so I combined those two

3705.089 --> 3711.15
and I speed him up by 10 and I made it

3709.41 --> 3714.1499999999996
like a I think it's like a four minutes

3711.15 --> 3716.76
video vote going away on our way and

3714.15 --> 3719.46
getting if they had the same the same

3716.76 --> 3721.2000000000003
footage that we saw from the one that

3719.46 --> 3724.08
gave you the strike but that was the

3721.2 --> 3726.4199999999996
second part of the video sped up I sped

3724.08 --> 3728.2799999999997
up the first part with the second part

3726.42 --> 3730.56
with the first part is perfect because

3728.28 --> 3732.8390000000004
it's the whole boat on the % visible

3730.56 --> 3735.93
like really close and then you can see

3732.839 --> 3739.14
