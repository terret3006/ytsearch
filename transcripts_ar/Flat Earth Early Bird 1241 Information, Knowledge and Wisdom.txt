there were also a lot more clouds

164.0 --> 168.84
and there was some rain so it yeah it

166.08 --> 171.36
kind of rained this night and in the

168.84 --> 172.64000000000001
evening but yeah it's good for the

171.36 --> 175.12
plants anyway

172.64 --> 177.599
it's it's dry and

175.12 --> 179.44
pretty nice and warm outside

177.599 --> 181.2
but yeah when

179.44 --> 184.68
clouds get in front of the sun it does

181.2 --> 184.67999999999998
get a bit chilly

185.519 --> 189.519
still quite beautiful out there

right

200.64 --> 202.879

292.24 --> 297.24
all right

293.919 --> 297.24
let's see

302.8 --> 307.44
letter debates

305.199 --> 307.44
was

308.84 --> 313.28
great don't think it lasted remarkably

311.919 --> 316.0
long but

313.28 --> 318.4
still just a good after show and like

316.0 --> 321.479
had great conversations afterwards with

318.4 --> 321.479
the guys

325.52 --> 329.44
also yeah watch the video from eric to

328.08 --> 332.15999999999997
bay

329.44 --> 334.0
sometimes i watch his videos this time

332.16 --> 335.6
about the great pyramid it was very

334.0 --> 336.639
interesting

335.6 --> 338.08000000000004
i mean

336.639 --> 339.44
they're all pretty much things i've

338.08 --> 341.84
heard before

339.44 --> 344.88
but he did put it really well together

341.84 --> 348.08
with some good photographs and

344.88 --> 348.08
yeah made a pretty

348.24 --> 355.12
clear picture oversight over what's

350.72 --> 355.12
going on there and the mysteries

355.199 --> 363.08000000000004
so yeah that was a interesting video

359.9 --> 363.08
[Music]

366.4 --> 369.919
jim bob live was awesome

374.72 --> 381.36
i got very active in chat oh yeah and a

377.36 --> 383.84000000000003
little flat side video apparently he's

381.36 --> 385.12
seeing if there's any animal

383.84 --> 388.23999999999995
or

385.12 --> 389.84000000000003
a movie reviewing

388.24 --> 391.36
and you get to see his face it's the

389.84 --> 393.11999999999995
first time i saw

391.36 --> 394.56
let's saw its face so that was kind of

393.12 --> 396.16
funny

394.56 --> 399.12
see that

396.16 --> 399.12
face with the voice

402.08 --> 409.71999999999997
dragon spilled the beard no dominoid

405.84 --> 409.71999999999997
hello timothy jordan

442.16 --> 447.88000000000005
i was watching something yesterday i

444.4 --> 447.88
remember what

462.16 --> 465.84000000000003
oh yeah also watch the [ __ ] bit of owen

464.479 --> 469.599
benjamin

465.84 --> 469.599
at a show with crow triple seven

470.319 --> 473.759
yeah but

471.44 --> 477.319
i can't really get very far though

473.759 --> 477.319
it's just that

478.639 --> 481.199
i don't know

489.28 --> 494.55999999999995
crow has a couple of ideas

492.72 --> 497.03900000000004
that are

494.56 --> 499.52
highly ethereal

497.039 --> 499.52
and that

500.96 --> 504.4
basically

502.16 --> 504.40000000000003
like

504.84 --> 510.31899999999996
yeah everybody seems to really like that

508.319 --> 513.6800000000001
do you guys like that what do you guys

510.319 --> 513.6800000000001
think of crow triple seven

517.599 --> 520.9590000000001
ancient alien

521.039 --> 524.919
what's going on with you

546.399 --> 551.519
i don't know is i feel hesitant but i

548.88 --> 554.0
yeah i have some pretty

551.519 --> 556.88
elaborate criticisms

554.0 --> 559.12
on crow triple seven

556.88 --> 560.48
and i don't really think that anybody

559.12 --> 562.399
gives a [ __ ]

560.48 --> 564.32
everybody just seems to really like his

562.399 --> 566.72
storytelling

564.32 --> 569.44
even though

566.72 --> 570.88
there's a lot of just

569.44 --> 574.72
[ __ ]

570.88 --> 574.72
things that he says like

574.839 --> 578.1600000000001
not yeah

580.0 --> 585.12
unprovable things like what he was

582.0 --> 586.64
talking about about stars

585.12 --> 588.08
like oh

586.64 --> 591.04
just

588.08 --> 593.2
i mean there is references with religion

591.04 --> 594.64
to thinking that oh

593.2 --> 596.72
i'm going to work

594.64 --> 600.16
like even eric to bay bench that a bit

596.72 --> 601.519
like through the egyptian and mayans

600.16 --> 603.68
that

601.519 --> 606.72
in their belief structure it was all

603.68 --> 608.4799999999999
about like ascending the spirit

606.72 --> 611.279
or the soul

608.48 --> 613.36
to above

611.279 --> 616.079
to basically do the next realm and you

613.36 --> 618.48
turn into a star or something right

616.079 --> 620.399
it's kind of a vague description it's

618.48 --> 622.88
very interesting if you look into like

620.399 --> 626.32
the spirit mechanics

622.88 --> 626.32
from that perspective but

626.399 --> 632.92
crow doesn't do that

628.8 --> 632.92
has anybody noticed that

634.079 --> 639.279
was he the one that did the lunar wave

636.24 --> 639.279
yes flatter sage

640.64 --> 644.399
but i mean he does shows all the time

642.959 --> 646.8
pretty

644.399 --> 649.2
yeah he has a pretty big crowd too

646.8 --> 649.29
oh benjamin is a really big fan of his

649.2 --> 650.5600000000001
and

649.29 --> 652.64
[Music]

650.56 --> 654.56
he's all connected up and everybody's

652.64 --> 655.8389999999999
all respective of him

654.56 --> 657.76
[Music]

655.839 --> 659.7600000000001
and i mean

657.76 --> 662.64
i get it he's like

659.76 --> 662.64
he's likable

664.24 --> 667.04
but

665.04 --> 670.48
i just feel a lot of the times he's just

667.04 --> 674.3199999999999
kind of blabbering his way through

670.48 --> 677.519
i don't feel a lot of like cohesion

674.32 --> 677.519
in his argumentation

684.959 --> 689.3599999999999
some things are not provable with

686.64 --> 691.519
science right

689.36 --> 693.6800000000001
well yeah there's plenty of things not

691.519 --> 697.12
proofable with science if you really

693.68 --> 698.64
hold to the scientific method but

697.12 --> 700.72
it's just that

698.64 --> 702.3199999999999
he has a tendency to make these

700.72 --> 704.5600000000001
assertions

702.32 --> 706.24
put them down quite eloquently and then

704.56 --> 708.16
everybody's like yeah yeah yeah oh

706.24 --> 712.16
that's so awesome

708.16 --> 712.16
like but i'm like listening and like

712.399 --> 718.959
yeah it sounds cute but it's not really

715.279 --> 722.16
that well thought out in my opinion

718.959 --> 722.16
maybe that's just me

729.519 --> 734.8
i mean i address all these kinds of

731.68 --> 737.279
things i address the the stars

734.8 --> 739.279
right all the time it's my it's all

737.279 --> 741.76
separate subject they're holographic

739.279 --> 743.76
right and how do they come

741.76 --> 746.56
into being and

743.76 --> 749.6
what causes them etc etc my show

746.56 --> 752.399
yesterday was pretty much all about that

749.6 --> 752.399
if you remember

752.72 --> 756.72
right

753.76 --> 759.12
so to me i approach things much more

756.72 --> 762.24
from a physics perspective

759.12 --> 762.24
and the spirit

763.839 --> 767.36
is there

765.279 --> 769.92
but i approach it

767.36 --> 773.04
kind of likes physics

769.92 --> 775.5999999999999
as well right

773.04 --> 777.92
it's just that yeah you can't really

775.6 --> 780.48
scientifically prove it but i approach

777.92 --> 783.36
it the same way crow doesn't do that he

780.48 --> 785.36
approached things through storytelling

783.36 --> 788.48
it's almost like bardic tradition

785.36 --> 790.9590000000001
information transfer

788.48 --> 794.32
but he seems better at

790.959 --> 797.5189999999999
laying down the story in a likable way

794.32 --> 799.36
than to actually put down a cohesive

797.519 --> 802.32
argument

799.36 --> 805.279
and that i find annoying because he

802.32 --> 810.0790000000001
doesn't improve

805.279 --> 812.48
yeah he doesn't he doesn't improve

810.079 --> 816.959
he's not

812.48 --> 821.76
he just collects these assertions

816.959 --> 821.76
i don't really see a lot of cohesion

822.079 --> 826.959
within like everything that he says

825.279 --> 829.8389999999999
it's an interesting

826.959 --> 829.8389999999999
it's not cohesive

831.839 --> 838.24
but i guess that yeah crow is the man so

835.04 --> 840.88
who am i stupid irwin

838.24 --> 845.839
with my attitude problems and i'm angry

840.88 --> 845.8389999999999
so i'm i'm lost anyway right

848.0 --> 852.639
but yeah i do what i do i'm honest and i

850.48 --> 856.04
have criticism about him i've had it for

852.639 --> 856.04
a long time

856.959 --> 861.5189999999999
never really communicated with him

862.16 --> 869.8389999999999
never sought contact i think i've sought

864.959 --> 872.2399999999999
contact but it's really difficult to

869.839 --> 874.0
yeah i don't think he like does actual

872.24 --> 877.279
live streams

874.0 --> 879.36
everything he does is recorded

877.279 --> 880.24
yeah how dare you create a size crew

879.36 --> 883.72
yeah

880.24 --> 883.72
classical homeopath

884.16 --> 887.16
right

914.56 --> 916.88
i mean

918.16 --> 923.12
for example

920.639 --> 927.519
you could have a very elaborate

923.12 --> 931.36
technical discussion to try to find out

927.519 --> 934.24
what it is that makes astrology work for

931.36 --> 935.92
example right

934.24 --> 937.839
it's confusing it's going to be like

935.92 --> 939.4399999999999
psychological

937.839 --> 940.5600000000001
like rhythmic

939.44 --> 942.9590000000001
nature

940.56 --> 944.399
situation there's all kinds of ways to

942.959 --> 946.16
like

944.399 --> 948.8
integrate that with

946.16 --> 951.12
physical world and like how is this

948.8 --> 952.56
working like i would typically do that i

951.12 --> 956.8
would do that like if the discussion

952.56 --> 956.8
came up at the flat earth debates

957.36 --> 962.8000000000001
crow doesn't do that

959.519 --> 964.399
he doesn't he he's like always like oh

962.8 --> 966.639
we don't know

964.399 --> 968.48
but here's what i think

966.639 --> 970.72
and it doesn't actually

968.48 --> 972.5600000000001
do that it doesn't

970.72 --> 975.6
like structurally

972.56 --> 977.5189999999999
connect things i feel like

975.6 --> 980.5600000000001
barely

977.519 --> 983.279
maybe he's just not good at that

980.56 --> 985.3599999999999
it's more better at like putting stories

983.279 --> 988.48
together in like a

985.36 --> 991.12
way that you'd like to hear it

988.48 --> 993.44
rather than the actual part of like

991.12 --> 996.44
puzzling things together for clearer

993.44 --> 996.44
oversight

996.8 --> 1000.88
i mean

997.839 --> 1001.839
he's been very consistent

1000.88 --> 1004.24
for

1001.839 --> 1007.36
a decade or something now he's active

1004.24 --> 1009.839
more maybe and he is so unbelievably

1007.36 --> 1011.92
consistent that to me i could like put

1009.839 --> 1015.12
on a show from crow

1011.92 --> 1016.0
like seven years ago

1015.12 --> 1019.519
and then

1016.0 --> 1021.44
directly after play a show from

1019.519 --> 1024.72
like this year

1021.44 --> 1027.3600000000001
i literally would not be able to tell

1024.72 --> 1027.3600000000001
the difference

1027.52 --> 1032.4
would you would you be able to tell the

1029.919 --> 1032.4
difference

1034.079 --> 1039.1989999999998
now if you do that with me

1036.72 --> 1042.959
i'm pretty damn sure that people will

1039.199 --> 1044.0790000000002
tell the difference in many many ways

1042.959 --> 1045.679
right

1044.079 --> 1049.039
it's still me

1045.679 --> 1052.24
but it's not exactly the same

1049.039 --> 1054.96
i'm constantly evolving involving my

1052.24 --> 1056.72
spirit adapting and trying to overcome

1054.96 --> 1058.64
obstacles and

1056.72 --> 1061.44
psychological especially and

1058.64 --> 1064.48
communication

1061.44 --> 1068.24
and i sound very different

1064.48 --> 1068.24
than i did like seven years ago

1075.919 --> 1081.3200000000002
what are you talking about you're in a

1077.679 --> 1081.3200000000002
weird mood today

1088.4 --> 1093.52
take what you need and leave the rest

1091.76 --> 1094.559
lift each other

1093.52 --> 1096.24
no

1094.559 --> 1100.16
no seeking star that's not what i'm

1096.24 --> 1100.16
doing i'm actually addressing

1102.88 --> 1108.8400000000001
i got a derp alert

1104.799 --> 1108.84
no i'm addressing it

1110.4 --> 1116.0
also because i want everybody else to

1113.36 --> 1118.6399999999999
address it to themselves like what are

1116.0 --> 1121.36
you listening to is it just like oh it's

1118.64 --> 1123.5200000000002
good old crow around the campfire let's

1121.36 --> 1124.8799999999999
just have fun have a drink and like oh

1123.52 --> 1129.2
stories

1124.88 --> 1131.44
so it's not paying attention time then

1129.2 --> 1134.0800000000002
because i don't like

1131.44 --> 1136.96
not paying attention time

1134.08 --> 1137.84
in general i don't like that i reject

1136.96 --> 1140.96
that

1137.84 --> 1140.9599999999998
to be more precise

1141.12 --> 1146.7199999999998
i don't like it when people do that i

1143.2 --> 1149.6000000000001
don't like it when they do it in my chat

1146.72 --> 1152.08
because i want people to pay attention

1149.6 --> 1154.1599999999999
there is so much to learn

1152.08 --> 1156.32
and so little time and if you don't

1154.16 --> 1159.919
learn

1156.32 --> 1162.08
at the tippy toes of your feet like

1159.919 --> 1164.16
really pay attention

1162.08 --> 1167.1999999999998
at the early stage then you're not going

1164.16 --> 1169.1200000000001
to pay more attention at a later stage

1167.2 --> 1171.28
yeah

1169.12 --> 1172.4799999999998
paying attention is a skill you need to

1171.28 --> 1176.44
learn

1172.48 --> 1176.44
and the sooner the better

1185.28 --> 1189.76
it's not good if you don't change your

1187.12 --> 1191.76
tune over time assign your stagnating

1189.76 --> 1194.72
yes

1191.76 --> 1197.52
but then again hey if he is super

1194.72 --> 1199.76
popular and he can keep on going even if

1197.52 --> 1201.52
it is the same routine sort of over and

1199.76 --> 1202.8799999999999
over

1201.52 --> 1206.96
then

1202.88 --> 1209.3600000000001
the stagnation doesn't really matter

1206.96 --> 1210.799
well not to him anyway or to his public

1209.36 --> 1212.8799999999999
right

1210.799 --> 1216.0
but

1212.88 --> 1218.24
i i just notice things and i point them

1216.0 --> 1221.2
out

1218.24 --> 1223.1200000000001
because my mission is not to be stagnant

1221.2 --> 1225.44
but it is to keep developing and

1223.12 --> 1229.039
developing and i want people that tune

1225.44 --> 1231.44
in to do the same thing

1229.039 --> 1233.28
to not settle for a routine you're just

1231.44 --> 1236.88
going to do over and over again the rest

1233.28 --> 1236.8799999999999
of your life exactly the same

1240.48 --> 1248.24
face your flaws address them deal with

1243.2 --> 1249.76
them improve them or overcome them

1248.24 --> 1252.4
and

1249.76 --> 1254.96
not just as a sort of oh i'm going to

1252.4 --> 1258.48
church i'm going to name the thing now

1254.96 --> 1260.96
that i do every time like oh today i

1258.48 --> 1263.6
learned this like no not like that no no

1260.96 --> 1265.919
no it's not about virtue signaling that

1263.6 --> 1268.32
you're supposed to learn something so

1265.919 --> 1270.64
you just get very good at making up

1268.32 --> 1273.9189999999999
something that you supposedly learn to

1270.64 --> 1275.44
fulfill your virtue signaling duty no

1273.919 --> 1278.4
it's about

1275.44 --> 1278.4
obsessive

1278.559 --> 1284.0
with your life to actually do that to

1281.76 --> 1285.36
face the things that you really don't

1284.0 --> 1287.2
want to face

1285.36 --> 1289.6
to the things the parts that are really

1287.2 --> 1292.32
hard and that others will not be able to

1289.6 --> 1294.24
connect with you over yeah those parts

1292.32 --> 1297.28
the parts that nobody likes to talk

1294.24 --> 1300.0
about those are the parts you actually

1297.28 --> 1303.44
need to improve

1300.0 --> 1305.919
the more people that do that the less

1303.44 --> 1308.559
the world will turn into a hell where

1305.919 --> 1310.24
eventually nobody addresses anything

1308.559 --> 1312.32
anymore

1310.24 --> 1314.159
because you don't need to

1312.32 --> 1317.559
just i'll let it happen that's what i'm

1314.159 --> 1317.5590000000002
trying to prevent

1325.84 --> 1330.72
that's why soap operas exist people like

1328.0 --> 1333.84
to yes

1330.72 --> 1333.84
but it's not good

1336.4 --> 1340.64
like

1337.2 --> 1344.799
watching soap operas actually ruins your

1340.64 --> 1344.7990000000002
social life did you realize that

1345.679 --> 1348.159
they do

1350.159 --> 1354.72
how many people do you know that are

1352.159 --> 1358.4
like really into soap operas that have

1354.72 --> 1359.44
great elaborate social lives

1358.4 --> 1362.159
zero

1359.44 --> 1363.679
yeah zero

1362.159 --> 1365.919
they don't

1363.679 --> 1368.0800000000002
people that have elaborate social lives

1365.919 --> 1370.96
don't watch soap operas because they

1368.08 --> 1373.6789999999999
know it's nonsense

1370.96 --> 1376.32
and it's just a distraction

1373.679 --> 1379.52
to people that aren't actually competent

1376.32 --> 1381.6789999999999
in social interaction

1379.52 --> 1384.32
and then they give you that weird

1381.679 --> 1387.679
replacement sensation so you feel you

1384.32 --> 1391.0
can still get some at a distance but

1387.679 --> 1391.0
it's fake

1417.679 --> 1423.1200000000001
spending an entire life in the pursuit

1419.679 --> 1423.1200000000001
of knowledge to what ends

1429.6 --> 1434.3999999999999
well it's a very simple pattern

1432.159 --> 1437.279
you understand more you get more power

1434.4 --> 1437.279
you have to then

1437.919 --> 1441.44
deal with the seductions that come with

1439.76 --> 1442.1589999999999
it and with the weight that comes with

1441.44 --> 1444.48
it

1442.159 --> 1448.4
and then hold on to it and see if you

1444.48 --> 1451.279
can actually integrate with that level

1448.4 --> 1451.279
and then if you do

1451.52 --> 1457.12
you go one step further and try if you

1454.64 --> 1459.3600000000001
can do that and you keep doing that

1457.12 --> 1461.9189999999999
pretty much until

1459.36 --> 1465.1999999999998
something really prevents you from doing

1461.919 --> 1468.0
that that you get stuck or you die

1465.2 --> 1468.0
what's the point

1468.4 --> 1473.159
you'll find out what's the point

1473.44 --> 1477.52
the point is is that you'll find out

1475.679 --> 1480.48
what the point is

1477.52 --> 1480.48
when you get there

1482.96 --> 1487.679
the point is that

1485.76 --> 1488.8799999999999
suspect mainly that when you get there

1487.679 --> 1491.279
because it

1488.88 --> 1494.7990000000002
works to this level and it's not the

1491.279 --> 1498.0
ultimate peak where i am

1494.799 --> 1501.2
it's all about somebody needs to [ __ ]

1498.0 --> 1503.919
do it before the entire world goes to

1501.2 --> 1506.799
[ __ ] and nothing can be done about it

1503.919 --> 1510.24
that's why you have to do it because

1506.799 --> 1515.1589999999999
otherwise the world turns into hell

1510.24 --> 1515.159
that's why you gotta do it

1515.919 --> 1521.2
that's my suspicion but there's probably

1518.559 --> 1523.2
a lot more to it

1521.2 --> 1527.72
when you actually get there when you're

1523.2 --> 1527.72
older and you do this all your life

1537.36 --> 1542.08
right it's also pragmatic indeed metal

1540.159 --> 1543.7600000000002
slugs cockatiel

1542.08 --> 1546.559
it opens the doors

1543.76 --> 1549.679
it gives you options and it helps you

1546.559 --> 1551.6789999999999
dispel illusions that might prevent you

1549.679 --> 1553.3600000000001
from opening those doors

1551.679 --> 1554.24
because you have a better understanding

1553.36 --> 1556.3999999999999
of

1554.24 --> 1557.279
what the illusions are why they are

1556.4 --> 1559.279
there

1557.279 --> 1562.0
what creates them

1559.279 --> 1565.12
top down or from your grassroots like

1562.0 --> 1567.6
why do people make up crazy excuses so

1565.12 --> 1570.4799999999998
they don't have to deal with it

1567.6 --> 1573.52
yeah

1570.48 --> 1575.84
a lot of conspiracy theory

1573.52 --> 1578.6399999999999
craziness nowadays

1575.84 --> 1581.4399999999998
that's out there you know why it's there

1578.64 --> 1582.8400000000001
so that when you specifically tap into

1581.44 --> 1586.559
that

1582.84 --> 1588.559
subject it basically erases the subtlety

1586.559 --> 1590.3999999999999
of everything else

1588.559 --> 1593.44
what's good about that

1590.4 --> 1594.96
you don't have to deal with it anymore

1593.44 --> 1597.52
yeah

1594.96 --> 1601.44
that's right

1597.52 --> 1605.84
if you get into really sick crazy [ __ ]

1601.44 --> 1605.8400000000001
then that becomes it all

1606.72 --> 1611.84
and you don't really see the rest

1609.2 --> 1614.64
anymore you don't see the actual

1611.84 --> 1616.72
subtleties of the complexities of a

1614.64 --> 1620.4
higher insight you don't see them

1616.72 --> 1621.279
anymore because of that right

1620.4 --> 1623.52
that's

1621.279 --> 1625.12
why some people shove it in your face

1623.52 --> 1626.6399999999999
especially when they get frustrated and

1625.12 --> 1628.799
they're like oh but what about the

1626.64 --> 1631.3600000000001
freaking elite and the trump sacrifice

1628.799 --> 1633.2
everyone yeah that's

1631.36 --> 1635.36
because

1633.2 --> 1638.88
the frustration

1635.36 --> 1641.12
they don't want to deal with the actual

1638.88 --> 1643.7600000000002
heavy weight anymore

1641.12 --> 1646.08
so they throw the [ __ ] at there

1643.76 --> 1649.32
so they have an excuse to slip away from

1646.08 --> 1649.32
that frequency

1663.12 --> 1668.08
right

1664.399 --> 1671.4399999999998
and by the way i know crow actually does

1668.08 --> 1671.4399999999998
know these types of things

1674.72 --> 1676.96
like

1677.279 --> 1681.36
crow is somebody that can also like tap

1679.84 --> 1683.6789999999999
into other people

1681.36 --> 1686.32
and up his own level

1683.679 --> 1688.72
in different ways temporarily he can do

1686.32 --> 1688.72
that too

1689.2 --> 1692.64
i've seen that i've seen it happen when

1691.12 --> 1695.039
he just

1692.64 --> 1697.3600000000001
joins up with people like

1695.039 --> 1698.1589999999999
it reflects off him what he's dealing

1697.36 --> 1701.039
with

1698.159 --> 1703.1200000000001
that's visible to me

1701.039 --> 1705.6
i do that too you know

1703.12 --> 1708.08
who i'm going to be facing one-on-one or

1705.6 --> 1710.559
in a group matters everything to my

1708.08 --> 1712.799
attitude it really does

1710.559 --> 1715.44
my attitude on the flat earth debates is

1712.799 --> 1717.12
very different than my attitude here i

1715.44 --> 1720.1200000000001
hope you took notice

1717.12 --> 1720.12
right

1734.64 --> 1738.76
what are you talking about

1742.72 --> 1747.919
the purpose of life is to glorify god

1751.2 --> 1753.8400000000001
okay

1756.48 --> 1761.279
i think that

1758.24 --> 1764.72
like the existential purpose is to

1761.279 --> 1764.72
fulfill our design

1765.039 --> 1768.64
that pretty much comes down to the same

1766.799 --> 1770.399
thing because it's all designed by god

1768.64 --> 1774.48
so it's to basically

1770.399 --> 1776.2399999999998
fulfill your design to not let your

1774.48 --> 1777.919
ego or

1776.24 --> 1780.159
the seductions

1777.919 --> 1782.96
destroy your life it's all about not

1780.159 --> 1785.2
letting evil destroy your potential

1782.96 --> 1787.3600000000001
that's basically what it all is to me

1785.2 --> 1788.159
all of it

1787.36 --> 1789.039
it's

1788.159 --> 1791.1200000000001
yeah

1789.039 --> 1793.2
a rough way to

1791.12 --> 1795.6
to cram it all into a single sentence

1793.2 --> 1797.679
but that's pretty much it it's about not

1795.6 --> 1800.08
letting evil destroy your life

1797.679 --> 1802.72
and oh oh you think it's so simple you

1800.08 --> 1805.76
only have to not do this and you do that

1802.72 --> 1809.44
hey have [ __ ] forget about it

1805.76 --> 1812.0
nobody can tell you

1809.44 --> 1813.919
exactly what it is

1812.0 --> 1815.679
and you hold on to that for the rest of

1813.919 --> 1817.279
your life no because it's always

1815.679 --> 1820.279
changing and that's the part of the

1817.279 --> 1820.279
point

1824.24 --> 1828.72
like fish is in the pond whatever is

1826.08 --> 1831.84
going to be dropped in that pond

1828.72 --> 1834.64
rain warm water poison

1831.84 --> 1836.6399999999999
whatever is going to get in there

1834.64 --> 1840.3990000000001
you're gonna have to deal with it as a

1836.64 --> 1840.3990000000001
fishy in that pond

1848.24 --> 1852.88
right so

1849.36 --> 1854.559
the glory of god is basically within our

1852.88 --> 1857.8400000000001
experience

1854.559 --> 1860.0
we're very close to

1857.84 --> 1864.36
understanding and feeling the connection

1860.0 --> 1864.36
and inside of the design

1866.399 --> 1872.08
but it's really about fulfilling the

1868.64 --> 1873.8400000000001
potential that you have like realizing

1872.08 --> 1877.799
that grabbing hold

1873.84 --> 1877.799
and then doing it

1881.279 --> 1884.32
whatever it is

1885.2 --> 1890.24
and you're supposed to find out

1887.84 --> 1894.08
right you're supposed to test things and

1890.24 --> 1896.24
ideas and god through the design

1894.08 --> 1898.32
will prove to you whether it's a good or

1896.24 --> 1900.159
bad idea

1898.32 --> 1902.559
like you don't really have to let

1900.159 --> 1905.519
anybody tell you

1902.559 --> 1907.519
you will find out

1905.519 --> 1910.64
doesn't matter what anybody told you

1907.519 --> 1912.32
about what you want to do

1910.64 --> 1914.24
whatever it is

1912.32 --> 1916.1589999999999
it will be

1914.24 --> 1918.32
revealed to you

1916.159 --> 1921.919
whether that's good or not

1918.32 --> 1926.1589999999999
no matter what anybody says about it

1921.919 --> 1927.279
you will separately from every other

1926.159 --> 1930.7990000000002
opinion

1927.279 --> 1933.36
find out through the design

1930.799 --> 1936.399
you always will

1933.36 --> 1940.399
unless you don't listen to god anymore

1936.399 --> 1941.1999999999998
but you listen to people instead

1940.399 --> 1943.039
huh

1941.2 --> 1946.039
somebody warned about that very

1943.039 --> 1946.039
specifically

1954.64 --> 1959.48
anyway i got some green tea again

1974.88 --> 1978.24
a cold springs queen

1981.44 --> 1986.039
chicken lady how are you doing

1990.24 --> 1993.36
yeah it was a

1991.519 --> 1995.2
entertaining second stream you had with

1993.36 --> 1999.799
clutch there

1995.2 --> 1999.799
the other day called spring queen

2006.96 --> 2010.88
notice by the way with that stream how

2009.36 --> 2013.039
like

2010.88 --> 2014.64
what was it like the first 15 minutes

2013.039 --> 2016.96
from the first stream you were both a

2014.64 --> 2019.279
bit like stumbling

2016.96 --> 2020.3990000000001
but in this stream it was absolutely

2019.279 --> 2023.919
like

2020.399 --> 2023.9189999999999
immediately like why

2024.96 --> 2030.919
you were straight at it it wasn't yeah

2027.279 --> 2030.919
very enjoyable

2051.04 --> 2055.679
yeah clutch is a good way it absolutely

2053.52 --> 2055.679
is

2055.919 --> 2060.359
ah

2056.8 --> 2060.3590000000004
hey tony whitcomb

2069.44 --> 2076.7200000000003
no rick back i don't think it's funny

2072.159 --> 2080.159
i mean darwin was a contemptible person

2076.72 --> 2081.359
pretty straightforward evil and insane i

2080.159 --> 2084.9190000000003
don't want

2081.359 --> 2084.919
that thanks

2089.119 --> 2091.28
hey

2100.839 --> 2106.32
jim seeking knowledge would be glorified

2103.76 --> 2108.88
that's interesting metal slugs coca-cola

2106.32 --> 2108.88
i agree

2114.24 --> 2119.9199999999996
if you understand god not believe you

2117.119 --> 2121.76
understand god the genesis an arbiter of

2119.92 --> 2124.0
knowledge yes he is

2121.76 --> 2126.4
god is the source of all information all

2124.0 --> 2128.72
ideas we get we directly get from god

2126.4 --> 2131.599
whether we accept that it comes from god

2128.72 --> 2133.68
or not you you can definitely you are

2131.599 --> 2135.92
definitely allowed to believe that it's

2133.68 --> 2136.8799999999997
your idea but guess what that's got to

2135.92 --> 2140.4
do

2136.88 --> 2141.92
is your ego going to be like oh so i am

2140.4 --> 2142.8
god now

2141.92 --> 2145.76
oh

2142.8 --> 2149.6800000000003
i am so special i'm a special boy i'm so

2145.76 --> 2152.1600000000003
smart that's what's gonna happen

2149.68 --> 2154.96
if you think that it's your ideas that

2152.16 --> 2158.2799999999997
it literally manifests out of nowhere in

2154.96 --> 2158.28
your head

2158.32 --> 2163.119
and you don't recognize that all ideas

2160.48 --> 2165.599
basically come from god

2163.119 --> 2167.28
right but indeed from that perspective

2165.599 --> 2170.0
if you realize all that then seeking

2167.28 --> 2173.3590000000004
knowledge is glorifying god yes and in

2170.0 --> 2176.88
that sense that's what i do

2173.359 --> 2178.96
that's how i see it very much like that

2176.88 --> 2179.92
right but it is

2178.96 --> 2182.16
power

2179.92 --> 2183.6800000000003
and if you

2182.16 --> 2185.2799999999997
don't have the right frequency if you

2183.68 --> 2187.04
don't have the right angle of approach

2185.28 --> 2189.2000000000003
if you don't have the right attitude

2187.04 --> 2192.24
then that power

2189.2 --> 2196.3999999999996
can be a great detriment

2192.24 --> 2198.4799999999996
so the more you get insight about things

2196.4 --> 2201.28
the more important it becomes you do

2198.48 --> 2205.76
things right and you take the path

2201.28 --> 2206.8
christ very serious because if you don't

2205.76 --> 2208.96
that

2206.8 --> 2211.2000000000003
being on that height that higher

2208.96 --> 2212.839
staircase is just going to bring more

2211.2 --> 2214.72
storm to

2212.839 --> 2217.2799999999997
you it's

2214.72 --> 2220.0789999999997
going to end up wrecking your life maybe

2217.28 --> 2222.48
even if you don't watch out

2220.079 --> 2223.92
so the more power the more important it

2222.48 --> 2225.76
is that you're pure

2223.92 --> 2227.359
and that you're straight

2225.76 --> 2229.119
and that's your discipline and that you

2227.359 --> 2232.96
understand that there will be more

2229.119 --> 2235.119
challenges and that like not as in oh it

2232.96 --> 2237.28
challenges what i know before but more

2235.119 --> 2239.44
challenging challenges

2237.28 --> 2242.44
as you step higher and that is

2239.44 --> 2242.44
unpreventable

2246.72 --> 2251.5989999999997
the pursuit of knowledge is meaning

2248.56 --> 2251.599
that's ridiculous

2253.44 --> 2257.839
that's literally ridiculous

2267.2 --> 2272.0
this pursuit of flat earth knowledge

2269.28 --> 2273.92
meaningless no it's not meaningless

2272.0 --> 2276.24
it's very important

2273.92 --> 2280.079
if you really want to get a grip on

2276.24 --> 2283.1189999999997
physical reality on physics yeah if you

2280.079 --> 2286.2400000000002
want to have a real grip on physics

2283.119 --> 2288.6400000000003
flat earth knowledge as you call it is

2286.24 --> 2291.5989999999997
critical

2288.64 --> 2294.0789999999997
if you keep stuck to that stupid virtual

2291.599 --> 2296.079
spinning ball in your imagination you're

2294.079 --> 2299.52
gonna get things wrong

2296.079 --> 2301.76
as in really wrong

2299.52 --> 2303.839
you're not gonna be able to get an

2301.76 --> 2306.5600000000004
actual better oversight

2303.839 --> 2308.64
you're not gonna find hidden insights

2306.56 --> 2310.7999999999997
within the design

2308.64 --> 2313.839
if you don't understand what is real and

2310.8 --> 2313.8390000000004
what isn't

2319.359 --> 2327.839
right agent it is kind of like that

2321.92 --> 2327.839
although i use a big g for that

2348.32 --> 2352.6400000000003
yeah borders but no and

2350.48 --> 2354.88
entertainment meaningless knowledge is

2352.64 --> 2356.4
kind of self-contradicting

2354.88 --> 2357.599
if it is knowledge then it isn't

2356.4 --> 2359.119
meaningless

2357.599 --> 2361.599
if it's meaningless then it's not

2359.119 --> 2361.599
knowledge

2362.16 --> 2368.0
like knowledge

2364.079 --> 2370.96
or let's just say the anti-sedent

2368.0 --> 2373.839
to knowledge is meaning

2370.96 --> 2375.92
there's no meaning then what about it is

2373.839 --> 2378.64
knowledge it's just

2375.92 --> 2378.64
random [ __ ]

2380.8 --> 2386.7200000000003
i mean distractions do not add up to

2384.079 --> 2389.2000000000003
knowledge you see except for the

2386.72 --> 2392.2
knowledge of how to distract people

2389.2 --> 2392.2
right

2405.44 --> 2410.16
knowledge is information yes but not all

2407.839 --> 2412.56
information is knowledge

2410.16 --> 2415.2799999999997
information is a substance it's a

2412.56 --> 2418.56
supernatural substance

2415.28 --> 2422.079
yeah knowledge

2418.56 --> 2426.319
is not just the substance knowledge is

2422.079 --> 2430.319
order within the substance that we with

2426.319 --> 2430.319
our consciousness can grab hold of

2431.92 --> 2438.44
the information is substance knowledge

2434.0 --> 2438.44
is structured substance

2446.0 --> 2449.76
so you would

2447.44 --> 2451.359
meaningless knowledge is just incorrect

2449.76 --> 2453.44
for this boy that's meaningless

2451.359 --> 2455.7599999999998
information

2453.44 --> 2459.2000000000003
the whole point about knowledge is that

2455.76 --> 2459.2000000000003
it isn't meaningless

2462.8 --> 2467.2400000000002
if it's meaningless then it's not

2464.24 --> 2467.24
knowledge

2480.72 --> 2485.9199999999996
right and when integrating experience

2482.72 --> 2487.9199999999996
knowledge the structured information

2485.92 --> 2490.56
that can be grasped by our consciousness

2487.92 --> 2492.56
when applied integrated and experienced

2490.56 --> 2495.599
yeah it does turn into wisdom then you

2492.56 --> 2498.7999999999997
have even more to reflect upon that

2495.599 --> 2499.599
cohesive structure that you applied

2498.8 --> 2501.76
yes

2499.599 --> 2503.3590000000004
so it's from information

2501.76 --> 2507.6800000000003
raw substance

2503.359 --> 2510.319
to knowledge structured substance

2507.68 --> 2515.52
graspable by the consciousness

2510.319 --> 2516.48
to wisdom applied structured information

2515.52 --> 2520.7599999999998
huh

2516.48 --> 2520.76
that might they'll make a good title

2521.17 --> 2524.289
[Music]

2622.48 --> 2628.319
okay that made no sense

2625.359 --> 2628.319
thanks for the warning

2628.48 --> 2634.68
yeah just it just went to mute out of

2630.88 --> 2634.6800000000003
nothing weird

2635.44 --> 2638.319
right

2636.4 --> 2641.119
so yeah i don't know how much you got i

2638.319 --> 2645.2
was talking about the comparison with

2641.119 --> 2645.2000000000003
with the computer processoring power

2645.359 --> 2651.119
right

2647.68 --> 2654.48
so information is data that's correct

2651.119 --> 2657.04
knowledge is not the cpu the cpu is the

2654.48 --> 2660.2400000000002
consciousness knowledge

2657.04 --> 2663.68
is a program

2660.24 --> 2666.4799999999996
see it's comprised of data

2663.68 --> 2668.96
but it's structured in a way

2666.48 --> 2673.04
the consciousness the cpu

2668.96 --> 2676.04
can process it and integrate it

2673.04 --> 2676.04
see

2678.8 --> 2683.28
that yeah that that's the comparison i

2680.88 --> 2683.28
would make

2684.88 --> 2689.28
regardless of semantic no but it's not

2686.88 --> 2693.7200000000003
semantics it's structure

2689.28 --> 2693.7200000000003
it's not semantics in this case

2709.359 --> 2712.359
hmm

2718.88 --> 2724.1600000000003
just trying to summon no it wasn't a bad

2720.96 --> 2726.8
analogy guard said i was just on a roll

2724.16 --> 2726.7999999999997
i'm just being

2727.28 --> 2733.119
just yeah perfectionist i'm sorry

2730.8 --> 2735.92
it's a good comparison i i

2733.119 --> 2738.2400000000002
started out even as i was very young as

2735.92 --> 2739.6800000000003
a teenager i started comparing

2738.24 --> 2741.2
processing of

2739.68 --> 2743.68
brain and the consciousness i didn't

2741.2 --> 2745.52
really have a lot of references yet so

2743.68 --> 2748.24
it was more simplified

2745.52 --> 2750.0
more materialistic

2748.24 --> 2753.2
but i compared it with the functioning

2750.0 --> 2753.2
of a computer all the time

2753.44 --> 2761.0
but in this case the comparison can be

2756.96 --> 2761.0
very close

2761.76 --> 2767.3590000000004
if you designate

2763.92 --> 2767.359
the elements correctly

2772.72 --> 2777.839
so i appreciated godzilla not i'm not

2775.76 --> 2780.3190000000004
trying to criticize i'm just kind of

2777.839 --> 2781.7599999999998
bitten rolling over you and

2780.319 --> 2784.64
adding to it

2781.76 --> 2788.079
basically i thank you for putting down

2784.64 --> 2791.68
that analogy it was very inspiring

2788.079 --> 2791.6800000000003
i just had a little improvement

2792.16 --> 2795.7999999999997
i hope you don't mind

2813.52 --> 2816.52
what

2825.2 --> 2830.0
knowledge is knowing the information we

2827.92 --> 2832.2400000000002
have

2830.0 --> 2834.24
yeah but if the information you have

2832.24 --> 2836.0789999999997
doesn't mean anything then it's not

2834.24 --> 2838.4799999999996
knowledge

2836.079 --> 2840.559
it's still just information it becomes

2838.48 --> 2843.2
knowledge when it's actually structured

2840.559 --> 2843.2000000000003
and useful

2843.52 --> 2846.48
when you can do something with it then

2845.68 --> 2849.9199999999996
it

2846.48 --> 2851.119
becomes wisdom as seeking star wars said

2849.92 --> 2852.64
earlier

2851.119 --> 2855.599
when you actually

2852.64 --> 2859.0
apply that knowledge

2855.599 --> 2859.0
with action

2887.68 --> 2890.68
hmm

2907.599 --> 2914.28
right and yeah you can test these three

2910.72 --> 2914.2799999999997
different levels

2914.4 --> 2920.079
information knowledge and wisdom in a

2917.119 --> 2921.76
whole bunch of fronts

2920.079 --> 2925.04
you you could make a game out of this

2921.76 --> 2928.2400000000002
like hey this thing that was set here

2925.04 --> 2930.0
is it information knowledge or wisdom or

2928.24 --> 2932.16
separate it

2930.0 --> 2933.839
which part is the information which part

2932.16 --> 2935.839
is knowledge which part is the wisdom

2933.839 --> 2937.359
this is something you can do

2935.839 --> 2939.359
yeah

2937.359 --> 2941.839
it's almost

2939.359 --> 2944.0789999999997
close to like numerology like ooh what

2941.839 --> 2945.52
if you add up the numbers what are all

2944.079 --> 2947.599
these together

2945.52 --> 2950.079
right that sort of thing except it's not

2947.599 --> 2952.6400000000003
with numbers it's not with math it's

2950.079 --> 2956.0
with the meaning of words

2952.64 --> 2957.52
that's what i like to do that's my

2956.0 --> 2961.839
gematria

2957.52 --> 2961.839
words is my gematria

2963.44 --> 2970.92
and i play around with it a lot

2966.319 --> 2970.92
as you might have taken notice by now

2993.2 --> 2999.839
yeah agm yeah newborn babies learning

2997.119 --> 3002.1600000000003
how to swim very quickly well that's

2999.839 --> 3006.0789999999997
that's reflex

3002.16 --> 3007.92
knowledge so it is like mechanical

3006.079 --> 3010.7200000000003
it is motion

3007.92 --> 3010.7200000000003
information

3010.96 --> 3016.48
it's not about the conscious right

3014.559 --> 3019.92
it's

3016.48 --> 3019.92
yeah mechanical memory

3020.48 --> 3024.319
that is there it's like an instinct

3022.48 --> 3027.359
system that's been built in it's very

3024.319 --> 3028.96
handy that we have that and that helps

3027.359 --> 3031.2
even before you're conscious about

3028.96 --> 3034.4
anything to learn it physically

3031.2 --> 3034.3999999999996
physically doing that

3038.48 --> 3045.28
right so but that's that mostly falls

3041.359 --> 3047.44
under like reflexes and all that i mean

3045.28 --> 3049.28
people

3047.44 --> 3052.7200000000003
usually don't really

3049.28 --> 3055.3590000000004
learn to have reflexes they just

3052.72 --> 3058.3999999999996
become conscious about it perhaps and

3055.359 --> 3059.52
improve upon it make it even sharper

3058.4 --> 3062.7200000000003
but

3059.52 --> 3064.559
like reflexes dodging jumping away at

3062.72 --> 3066.319
the right moment right before you get

3064.559 --> 3068.4
hit by something

3066.319 --> 3072.0
that's not something that you have to be

3068.4 --> 3074.319
taught or like oh when somebody hits you

3072.0 --> 3075.92
you gotta evade it

3074.319 --> 3078.319
you get it son

3075.92 --> 3081.6800000000003
so when somebody hits you you gotta try

3078.319 --> 3084.8
to evade it no you're going to do it

3081.68 --> 3087.68
why because it's instinct

3084.8 --> 3089.599
your instinct tells you that reflexes

3087.68 --> 3091.7599999999998
right

3089.599 --> 3093.04
dodging is a basic replay it's very

3091.76 --> 3094.4
simple

3093.04 --> 3096.88
swimming is a little bit more

3094.4 --> 3099.359
complicated because it's like a full

3096.88 --> 3102.92
body process but it is basically the

3099.359 --> 3102.92
same sort of thing

3122.4 --> 3125.839
meaningless knowledge

3126.8 --> 3130.319
right

3128.079 --> 3132.6400000000003
soap opera characters meaningless not

3130.319 --> 3133.92
yeah that's decent enough case what is

3132.64 --> 3135.92
boy

3133.92 --> 3139.28
i mean it is knowledge it is structured

3135.92 --> 3141.839
it is a story structure but it is

3139.28 --> 3141.8390000000004
pointless

3142.079 --> 3147.52
and often very artificial you don't re

3144.72 --> 3151.68
you can't really apply

3147.52 --> 3153.92
that knowledge and turn it into wisdom

3151.68 --> 3155.7599999999998
so it's like in between knowledge and

3153.92 --> 3157.359
just data because it's kind of pointless

3155.76 --> 3159.76
knowledge meaningless knowledge is

3157.359 --> 3159.7599999999998
correct

3161.76 --> 3166.559
the only meaning is

3163.44 --> 3169.92
the only application that you could find

3166.559 --> 3172.3190000000004
with knowing about soap opera characters

3169.92 --> 3174.88
because there is an application

3172.319 --> 3177.92
is that you will know

3174.88 --> 3181.359
the things that a lot of other people

3177.92 --> 3182.2400000000002
that also like that soap opera you will

3181.359 --> 3184.16
know

3182.24 --> 3187.359
what they know

3184.16 --> 3189.92
so you share a common knowledge

3187.359 --> 3191.2
about that right and that's the only

3189.92 --> 3193.599
actual

3191.2 --> 3195.5989999999997
application that you could get out of it

3193.599 --> 3197.52
that is practical not because of the

3195.599 --> 3199.119
structure of the knowledge because that

3197.52 --> 3202.079
is fictional and

3199.119 --> 3204.079
exaggerated romanticized it's not real

3202.079 --> 3205.6800000000003
it doesn't work that well in real life

3204.079 --> 3208.1600000000003
not like that

3205.68 --> 3210.16
but because you share the knowledge with

3208.16 --> 3212.64
others others have watched it

3210.16 --> 3215.359
you can apply that

3212.64 --> 3217.2
you can apply knowing about it with the

3215.359 --> 3218.88
other people

3217.2 --> 3221.8799999999997
for good or for bad

3218.88 --> 3221.88
right

3232.24 --> 3236.52
fictional characters are not knowledge

3237.04 --> 3241.839
no but they are structured though

3239.92 --> 3244.2400000000002
it's not just information they are

3241.839 --> 3247.04
structured they have a story arc

3244.24 --> 3249.52
and they're consistent

3247.04 --> 3250.5589999999997
right people

3249.52 --> 3252.64
the

3250.559 --> 3254.6400000000003
around the place

3252.64 --> 3257.68
and watch that and there will be people

3254.64 --> 3261.04
watching it they know about it

3257.68 --> 3263.04
and so you share that knowledge

3261.04 --> 3265.2
you might know even a little bit more

3263.04 --> 3267.839
about it than they do

3265.2 --> 3270.24
but you watch the same thing so you have

3267.839 --> 3272.64
that knowledge not that the content of

3270.24 --> 3274.8799999999997
the knowledge is meaningful

3272.64 --> 3274.8799999999997
right

3276.319 --> 3280.5589999999997
but

3277.68 --> 3280.5589999999997
you share it

3289.2 --> 3294.0
the [ __ ] are you doing the logical what

3291.04 --> 3297.119
the hell are you drawing in there

3294.0 --> 3297.119
could be fiction

3302.48 --> 3307.599
i'm sorry jesus christ is not fiction

3305.28 --> 3310.48
but yeah the bible is

3307.599 --> 3313.119
it is a rewrite it is a story based upon

3310.48 --> 3315.28
real world events

3313.119 --> 3318.48
rewritten

3315.28 --> 3318.48
that's what the bible is

3318.799 --> 3323.119
it's not fiction

3321.2 --> 3325.52
it's based on the real

3323.119 --> 3325.52
event

3330.16 --> 3337.1189999999997
or is that fiction that

3333.28 --> 3337.119
might be contradicting myself but

3337.599 --> 3342.96
i mean jesus christ is real that spirit

3340.0 --> 3346.92
is real that way of thinking is real

3342.96 --> 3346.92
the vision is real

3362.96 --> 3368.16
i thought education

3365.04 --> 3370.48
information makes no sense

3368.16 --> 3372.24
that's a bit of an over generalization

3370.48 --> 3376.2
there

3372.24 --> 3376.2
geronimo 6.

3385.359 --> 3389.44
i mean people can definitely figure

3388.24 --> 3391.9199999999996
things out

3389.44 --> 3394.2400000000002
even without education

3391.92 --> 3394.2400000000002
okay

3394.4 --> 3398.4
i mean i used to see it as a sport it's

3397.2 --> 3400.799
like oh

3398.4 --> 3402.48
we're gonna learn about this thing now

3400.799 --> 3405.44
and i'd like

3402.48 --> 3407.52
i'm going to understand this before it

3405.44 --> 3408.48
is explained to me

3407.52 --> 3412.64
yeah

3408.48 --> 3414.16
yeah you can you can absolutely

3412.64 --> 3417.52
process

3414.16 --> 3420.0
information without education

3417.52 --> 3422.4
you don't need to be told how to

3420.0 --> 3426.96
interpret everything to figure that out

3422.4 --> 3426.96
by the very structure of the information

3427.599 --> 3431.44
especially

3428.88 --> 3433.28
if you know ahead of time that it is

3431.44 --> 3435.44
cohesive

3433.28 --> 3437.76
that it should be cohesive because it's

3435.44 --> 3440.4
being taught

3437.76 --> 3441.44
there should at least be a suggestion

3440.4 --> 3443.6800000000003
or a

3441.44 --> 3446.559
general

3443.68 --> 3448.16
consensus that it is cohesive enough so

3446.559 --> 3451.44
you can

3448.16 --> 3455.359
lean on that as you process it before

3451.44 --> 3455.359
you are educated about it

3458.72 --> 3467.0389999999998
it's called figuring things out

3463.88 --> 3467.039
[Music]

3518.559 --> 3523.3590000000004
the biblical portrayals accurate no i

3520.96 --> 3526.48
think actually the biblical portrayal is

3523.359 --> 3530.88
accurate i just think that a whole bunch

3526.48 --> 3533.92
of other people have been blabbering on

3530.88 --> 3536.48
like forcing him onto a pedestal that he

3533.92 --> 3539.359
didn't claim not like that

3536.48 --> 3542.079
jesus did a lot of esoteric talking and

3539.359 --> 3544.88
he was basically trying to explain

3542.079 --> 3545.76
like you can be with god

3544.88 --> 3548.0
like

3545.76 --> 3551.119
basically we're potentially all

3548.0 --> 3553.52
descendants of god

3551.119 --> 3555.6800000000003
maybe even

3553.52 --> 3558.16
the whole point about

3555.68 --> 3559.2799999999997
i am god and this and that when he would

3558.16 --> 3560.3999999999996
use that

3559.28 --> 3561.44
in my

3560.4 --> 3564.079
view

3561.44 --> 3567.599
and yeah i know it's endlessly disputed

3564.079 --> 3571.44
all this oh but there's like 500 people

3567.599 --> 3574.559
out there that have spent 40 to 80 years

3571.44 --> 3577.359
studying it and they are absolutely

3574.559 --> 3578.48
certain i'm wrong about this of course

3577.359 --> 3582.0789999999997
yes

3578.48 --> 3584.0
but i definitely believe

3582.079 --> 3585.52
that he thought like

3584.0 --> 3587.599
now we're all

3585.52 --> 3590.64
descendants of god we all have that

3587.599 --> 3592.2400000000002
power you can be like that too all you

3590.64 --> 3595.04
need to do

3592.24 --> 3596.8799999999997
is not get distracted

3595.04 --> 3599.839
by the seductions

3596.88 --> 3601.2000000000003
do the right thing follow the rules and

3599.839 --> 3603.52
realize

3601.2 --> 3604.5589999999997
war is not always the answer sometimes

3603.52 --> 3605.839
it is

3604.559 --> 3607.6800000000003
but like

3605.839 --> 3609.7599999999998
always try to

3607.68 --> 3612.799
find a way through

3609.76 --> 3614.48
right that's a summarization

3612.799 --> 3617.52
symbol basically

3614.48 --> 3618.2400000000002
didn't literally say that

3617.52 --> 3620.559
but

3618.24 --> 3622.799
to show he a lot of what he did was to

3620.559 --> 3625.0400000000004
show where people would be like ready to

3622.799 --> 3627.2
go at it and he's like yeah but you just

3625.04 --> 3629.359
say this and you do that give him that

3627.2 --> 3632.8799999999997
perspective and bang

3629.359 --> 3634.799
there is no more there is no conflict

3632.88 --> 3638.2400000000002
actual diplomacy

3634.799 --> 3638.24
in a good way not just

3638.4 --> 3641.6800000000003
get everybody to shut up so we can do

3640.24 --> 3643.1189999999997
business again not that kind of

3641.68 --> 3644.16
diplomacy

3643.119 --> 3646.0
right

3644.16 --> 3648.64
that's what he showed

3646.0 --> 3651.359
and i'm convinced that that was

3648.64 --> 3651.359
his thing

3651.44 --> 3656.7200000000003
it's the ultimate thing about him

3653.839 --> 3659.359
and then of course

3656.72 --> 3661.68
the powers that be you could say the

3659.359 --> 3664.48
catholic church they like turn it

3661.68 --> 3668.0789999999997
exactly inside out and they

3664.48 --> 3670.799
totally try to undo every

3668.079 --> 3674.319
deep power about jesus message by

3670.799 --> 3675.839
literally contradicting everything

3674.319 --> 3678.24
that he said everything they

3675.839 --> 3681.359
contradicted

3678.24 --> 3683.5989999999997
they claimed no he is the sole one and

3681.359 --> 3686.5589999999997
you don't have to do anything you just

3683.599 --> 3688.0
have to believe in this stupid little

3686.559 --> 3689.2000000000003
riddle and then it's all right like a

3688.0 --> 3691.2
satanist

3689.2 --> 3692.0789999999997
yeah just believe whatever the [ __ ] you

3691.2 --> 3694.5589999999997
want

3692.079 --> 3696.1600000000003
chant this and you can you go to heaven

3694.559 --> 3698.4
you can do whatever the [ __ ] you want

3696.16 --> 3700.319
who gives a [ __ ] about morals

3698.4 --> 3701.839
right

3700.319 --> 3704.96
i know that's a bit of an over

3701.839 --> 3704.96
exaggeration but

3705.44 --> 3710.2400000000002
yeah i think

3707.76 --> 3712.3190000000004
the ultimate sentence to me from jesus

3710.24 --> 3714.3999999999996
and they left it in there even through

3712.319 --> 3716.64
the council of nicaea they left it in

3714.4 --> 3717.92
there there will be those that surpass

3716.64 --> 3718.799
me yeah

3717.92 --> 3721.96
yeah

3718.799 --> 3725.92
there you go yeah that one sentence

3721.96 --> 3728.2400000000002
completely wrecks the entire catholic

3725.92 --> 3731.039
priesthood the entirety of it and

3728.24 --> 3731.0389999999998
everything they do

3731.599 --> 3736.559
papacy all it completely it wrecks it

3734.88 --> 3737.839
all

3736.559 --> 3742.3190000000004
yeah

3737.839 --> 3743.52
he is not the special boy he is not a

3742.319 --> 3746.72
unique

3743.52 --> 3750.24
thing like that he literally said it he

3746.72 --> 3752.72
is not a unique thing he's just

3750.24 --> 3754.3999999999996
unique and that

3752.72 --> 3755.1189999999997
he's sort of first

3754.4 --> 3757.28
or

3755.119 --> 3758.7200000000003
the most successful

3757.28 --> 3761.28
first

3758.72 --> 3764.8799999999997
i mean maybe jesus like figures even

3761.28 --> 3765.599
existed like 10 000 years ago

3764.88 --> 3768.7200000000003
but

3765.599 --> 3770.96
they didn't really make it

3768.72 --> 3772.9599999999996
they might have very well had the same

3770.96 --> 3776.319
type of insight the same type of

3772.96 --> 3778.4
inspiration the same connection with god

3776.319 --> 3780.72
who how do we know

3778.4 --> 3785.359
it was jesus

3780.72 --> 3785.359
that got through and we're still

3786.0 --> 3791.839
we're still reading his message

3788.88 --> 3795.28
even though it's highly encapsulated by

3791.839 --> 3799.0
literally the devil that tries to use it

3795.28 --> 3799.0
jesus like a mask

3813.64 --> 3819.68
judeo christian church that's

3818.24 --> 3822.799
what

3819.68 --> 3822.799
there's no such thing

3823.76 --> 3829.76
it's either judeo or it's christian

3826.48 --> 3829.76
they're not compatible

3834.079 --> 3838.6400000000003
i mean if you kind of call it

3835.88 --> 3842.1600000000003
judeo-christian then it's just jews

3838.64 --> 3842.16
pretending to be christian

3846.96 --> 3852.16
yeah judeo christian so that means your

3850.0 --> 3854.799
your jews whatever the [ __ ] that even

3852.16 --> 3855.68
means these days it's not a touring jew

3854.799 --> 3858.88
yeah

3855.68 --> 3861.44
you're jews that are

3858.88 --> 3863.6800000000003
like oh but we're also christian oh yeah

3861.44 --> 3865.2000000000003
except it's completely the opposite of

3863.68 --> 3867.7599999999998
one another so which one's going to

3865.2 --> 3870.799
perish ah yeah we know which one's going

3867.76 --> 3874.96
to perish the nice side that'll be like

3870.799 --> 3877.359
oh i'm the good boy i will i will be you

3874.96 --> 3879.359
i will be when you go there

3877.359 --> 3881.44
i will have humility

3879.359 --> 3883.839
i will protect

3881.44 --> 3885.119
will protect the jew

3883.839 --> 3886.4
yes

3885.119 --> 3890.0
we know

3886.4 --> 3892.559
judea christian is just judeo

3890.0 --> 3896.079
it just is is they're not compatible

3892.559 --> 3898.799
yeah islam is much more compatible with

3896.079 --> 3900.559
christianity

3898.799 --> 3902.64
than

3900.559 --> 3905.119
yeah

3902.64 --> 3906.83
the jew religion whatever the [ __ ] that

3905.119 --> 3911.2000000000003
even is these days what do you call it

3906.83 --> 3912.5589999999997
[Music]

3911.2 --> 3914.64
that [ __ ]

3912.559 --> 3918.2400000000002
yeah it's not compatible

3914.64 --> 3921.8799999999997
they literally [ __ ] on christ i

3918.24 --> 3921.8799999999997
it's not compatible

3926.96 --> 3931.359
jesus is jewish no he's not

3931.839 --> 3939.359
they were not jewish like that

3935.76 --> 3941.92
they were torah followers

3939.359 --> 3941.92
torah

3942.079 --> 3948.7200000000003
torah

3944.96 --> 3948.7200000000003
yeah that's not the same thing

3948.96 --> 3955.119
it's very different jews what you think

3951.839 --> 3958.72
is jews back then is completely

3955.119 --> 3962.079
different from what it is now

3958.72 --> 3966.48
they're not compatible

3962.079 --> 3970.559
it's arguably what is called jews now

3966.48 --> 3972.4
is just satanists pretending to be the

3970.559 --> 3974.48
jews of old

3972.4 --> 3976.559
only in name

3974.48 --> 3979.2
because nothing they do

3976.559 --> 3983.119
is compatible with the teachings of the

3979.2 --> 3984.96
torah what so [ __ ] ever

3983.119 --> 3987.2000000000003
it's a mockery

3984.96 --> 3991.28
that they call it themselves a jew it's

3987.2 --> 3993.839
a mockery on the bible in itself

3991.28 --> 3993.8390000000004
you understand

4003.839 --> 4008.5589999999997
yeah so

4004.839 --> 4011.92
jesus was jewish in the sense that he

4008.559 --> 4011.92
followed the torah

4012.64 --> 4016.4
very serious about that yeah

4017.119 --> 4022.4
not

4018.16 --> 4025.0389999999998
what we now know as jews

4022.4 --> 4027.92
has absolutely nothing to do with it and

4025.039 --> 4029.5200000000004
most jews that call themselves jews and

4027.92 --> 4033.119
are part of a

4029.52 --> 4035.92
little family of jews they even freaking

4033.119 --> 4038.88
say it to your face when you ask them

4035.92 --> 4041.76
with pride do you know that do you

4038.88 --> 4045.0
realize that

4041.76 --> 4045.0
do you

4067.77 --> 4070.9

4198.239 --> 4201.759999999999
then she'll tell you but yeah don't

4199.92 --> 4204.61
forget she'll tell you oh what that

[Music]

4207.199 --> 4211.678999999999
yeah

4208.159 --> 4214.719
but she jesus absolutely said that

4211.679 --> 4217.28
if anybody here is capable and finding

4214.719 --> 4221.44
that specific bible reference that would

4217.28 --> 4223.599999999999
be great i i'm not able to do that

4221.44 --> 4224.5599999999995

donation anyway but

4275.6 --> 4281.1990000000005
have you considered just

4277.92 --> 4283.12

4281.199 --> 4284.4
maybe

4283.12 --> 4286.8
i mean

4284.4 --> 4288.4

4286.8 --> 4290.320000000001
objection there

4288.4 --> 4292.5599999999995
is it's so dangerous getting your own

4290.32 --> 4294.799999999999
paypal account

4292.56 --> 4299.04
i mean i'm pretty sure they do allow men

4294.8 --> 4304.320000000001
to have paypal accounts i have one

4427.92 --> 4434.4

when they get in your way like they did

4592.88 --> 4595.84
jesus

4604.96 --> 4609.679
every time i hear about that it's so

4606.8 --> 4612.56
weird that story

4609.679 --> 4615.679
now i just imagined in my head like that

4612.56 --> 4617.6
she had complete facial reconstruction

4615.679 --> 4619.84
grafted from just

4617.6 --> 4622.159000000001
that it's all com like her entire skin

4619.84 --> 4623.360000000001
would be just pieces of graft together

4622.159 --> 4627.199
foreskin

4623.36 --> 4627.199
that's a creepy [ __ ] idea

4627.36 --> 4631.04
that's not what happened by the way i'm

4629.12 --> 4633.28
pretty sure it isn't

4631.04 --> 4635.44
more like just

4633.28 --> 4637.84
injection [ __ ]

4635.44 --> 4637.839999999999
anyway

4647.92 --> 4653.5
he never said one hateful thing

4649.94 --> 4653.5
[Music]

4657.04 --> 4660.56
he is

4658.159 --> 4662.08
on purpose pushing that though he's

4660.56 --> 4664.4800000000005
always tricking

4662.08 --> 4666.8
to be on the edge of hateful but then

4664.48 --> 4669.44
still make something funny out of it

4666.8 --> 4672.0
it's what he does

4669.44 --> 4674.5599999999995
and there will be trigger there will be

4672.0 --> 4674.56
triggering

4675.76 --> 4679.84
it's the owen benjamin challenge

4685.36 --> 4691.239
if a plane flew into an angel spoon

4694.48 --> 4700.839999999999
why

4695.92 --> 4700.84
i don't yeah well as wsw2021

4701.52 --> 4705.84
uh the angel spoon is basically a

4703.84 --> 4709.6
magnetic effect that i call the angel

4705.84 --> 4711.4400000000005
spoons for the fun of it because i can

4709.6 --> 4714.64
but yeah

4711.44 --> 4718.0
an airplane is not filled

4714.64 --> 4720.08
with salt water so how is it gonna

4718.0 --> 4722.56
how is that angel spoon going to

4720.08 --> 4723.84
influence the plane

4722.56 --> 4725.76
you see

4723.84 --> 4727.4400000000005
it's not really

4725.76 --> 4730.159000000001
because the plane is not filled with

4727.44 --> 4730.159
salt water

4731.92 --> 4736.56
i mean if you really want to test it

4735.12 --> 4737.679
then

4736.56 --> 4740.0
yeah

4737.679 --> 4740.0
get a

4740.08 --> 4744.88
a batch or a like a floating pole or

4743.6 --> 4746.64
like a

4744.88 --> 4749.36
a pool you could carry under a

4746.64 --> 4751.280000000001
helicopter or something

4749.36 --> 4752.08
with some sensories

4751.28 --> 4753.599999999999
or

4752.08 --> 4756.719
the blimp

4753.6 --> 4760.320000000001
with a saltwater pool hanging beneath it

4756.719 --> 4762.96
really weird by the way that idea

4760.32 --> 4766.159
that would just like hang over it and

4762.96 --> 4767.76
then see like is there like a weird tide

4766.159 --> 4769.759999999999
effect

4767.76 --> 4772.0
in that pool even though it's not part

4769.76 --> 4774.400000000001
of the ocean there

4772.0 --> 4776.159
that would be interesting

4774.4 --> 4779.599999999999
it would be interesting to basically

4776.159 --> 4781.759999999999
have magnetic readings using salt water

4779.6 --> 4784.400000000001
separated from the ocean to figure out

4781.76 --> 4786.2390000000005
if there if the magnetic angel spoon

4784.4 --> 4788.719
effect

4786.239 --> 4790.879999999999
basically reaches even

4788.719 --> 4793.36
above the ocean

4790.88 --> 4796.32
right is this all

4793.36 --> 4796.32
exploratory

4815.679 --> 4818.92
hey crockett

4837.92 --> 4840.92
hmm

4849.76 --> 4853.679
nobody ever spoke like that spake

4852.159 --> 4856.239
spoketh

4853.679 --> 4858.4
yeah it's it's early english

4856.239 --> 4862.08
they did actually talk like that but it

4858.4 --> 4864.0
was like official speech

4862.08 --> 4866.0
right

4864.0 --> 4868.719
it had like the

4866.0 --> 4870.88
the the regular folks talking to their

4868.719 --> 4873.44
neighbors not the bloody blonde barely

4870.88 --> 4876.08
recognizable it's english it's still

4873.44 --> 4878.638999999999
like that right and then you had like

4876.08 --> 4880.88
the more the court speak like official

4878.639 --> 4882.159000000001
functionaries and

4880.88 --> 4884.719
speeches

4882.159 --> 4888.0
and they did speak like that

4884.719 --> 4893.4
spoketh speaketh

4888.0 --> 4893.4
they did that's how in early english was

4902.08 --> 4906.08
they

4903.12 --> 4909.84
wrote it like did not how do you

4906.08 --> 4912.84
what how is that easily provable clutch

4909.84 --> 4912.84
what

4916.8 --> 4922.400000000001
like

4917.84 --> 4924.32
how do you suggest to prove that easily

4922.4 --> 4927.04
uh

4924.32 --> 4930.599999999999
does anybody have any recordings from

4927.04 --> 4930.6
early 1600s

4931.679 --> 4934.159
no

4932.639 --> 4937.159000000001
oh

4934.159 --> 4937.159
okay

4953.76 --> 4957.679
you by looking at other literature yeah

4955.44 --> 4959.839999999999
well then you that still doesn't mean

4957.679 --> 4961.52
that you're going to see like where how

4959.84 --> 4963.12
they pronounced it

4961.52 --> 4966.0
rufus and huggins that's the point

4963.12 --> 4968.4
clutch is making a claim that

4966.0 --> 4970.88
did you don't pronounce it like that

4968.4 --> 4972.638999999999
what how do you prove that if it's

4970.88 --> 4974.31
written like how do you prove they

4972.639 --> 4976.400000000001
didn't pronounce it like that

4974.31 --> 4977.280000000001
[Music]

4976.4 --> 4978.638999999999
like

4977.28 --> 4981.12
what

4978.639 --> 4984.12
you'll show me

4981.12 --> 4984.12
how

5000.08 --> 5005.5199999999995
i mean unless there's something written

5002.48 --> 5009.199
about pronunciation itself like if there

5005.52 --> 5012.88
was like a 1600 book about pronunciation

5009.199 --> 5015.599999999999
linguistics early ones not like made in

5012.88 --> 5017.92
the 19th century like oh yeah this is

5015.6 --> 5019.92
how we believe

5017.92 --> 5022.639
they pronounced it

5019.92 --> 5025.4400000000005
300 years ago yeah that's completely

5022.639 --> 5026.8
useless that's just somebody's opinion

5025.44 --> 5029.04
how do you know

5026.8 --> 5032.08
unless it's a literal study of linked

5029.04 --> 5035.12
within linguistics of the language in

5032.08 --> 5037.04
that very same time so you hear people

5035.12 --> 5040.92
speaking on the streets

5037.04 --> 5040.92
it's completely pointless

5068.84 --> 5073.76
hmm right so yeah linguistics is very

5071.92 --> 5076.96
cool clutch

5073.76 --> 5078.639
but a linguist can't

5076.96 --> 5082.4
tell you

5078.639 --> 5085.1990000000005
how they pronounced it like 400 years

5082.4 --> 5086.0
ago

5085.199 --> 5088.719
like

5086.0 --> 5090.48
to say like oh this is how they wrote it

5088.719 --> 5093.76
but they didn't pronounce it like that

5090.48 --> 5096.5599999999995
like how do you know

5093.76 --> 5099.280000000001
like did you get that from like verbal

5096.56 --> 5101.679
tradition over what is it like 20

5099.28 --> 5104.719
generations somebody passed that like

5101.679 --> 5105.84
how does that even work

5104.719 --> 5108.08
like

5105.84 --> 5109.52
linguistics unless you're literally

5108.08 --> 5111.76
hearing it

5109.52 --> 5115.76
the moment you're studying it then it's

5111.76 --> 5115.76
like that's just somebody's guess

5116.08 --> 5119.6
how do we know anything

5118.48 --> 5121.44
by

5119.6 --> 5124.400000000001
testing it by

5121.44 --> 5126.5599999999995
observing it in the field

5124.4 --> 5129.92
if you don't observe things in the field

5126.56 --> 5129.92
it's just speculation

5131.04 --> 5135.679
the sound of middle english language

5135.84 --> 5139.52
that's

5137.199 --> 5139.5199999999995
yay

5139.679 --> 5143.12
no proof there

5141.36 --> 5145.28
i mean they might have done like a

5143.12 --> 5146.8
pretty deep research as a linguist and

5145.28 --> 5147.92
all that but

5146.8 --> 5151.52
like

5147.92 --> 5154.08
you i i don't know like i'd like to go

5151.52 --> 5156.320000000001
up in a discussion like oh really oh

5154.08 --> 5158.08
really this is how they pronounced it

5156.32 --> 5159.759999999999
400 years ago

5158.08 --> 5162.5599999999995
what's your proof

5159.76 --> 5164.719
like what the [ __ ] is your proof

5162.56 --> 5168.2390000000005
how do you know that

5164.719 --> 5170.4
all we have is the written language from

5168.239 --> 5172.0
that time how do you [ __ ] know how

5170.4 --> 5174.5599999999995
they pronounced it

5172.0 --> 5176.96
that they just didn't say these things

5174.56 --> 5180.4400000000005
like that

5176.96 --> 5180.44
how do you know

5188.32 --> 5194.199
i love you in german sounds like

5190.0 --> 5194.199
complete gibberish no it doesn't

5196.56 --> 5200.679
what's gibberish about that

5230.239 --> 5235.599999999999
how come i never stream outside

5233.199 --> 5235.599999999999
because

5236.239 --> 5242.32
i'm stuck to a computer

5238.8 --> 5243.28
and i don't use wireless so there's a

5242.32 --> 5246.5599999999995
wire

5243.28 --> 5250.84
on the webcam there's a wire on the mic

5246.56 --> 5250.84
that's wide on stream outside

5258.96 --> 5263.36
also yeah i

5260.639 --> 5265.36
it's gonna be very tough to keep track

5263.36 --> 5267.36
of chat

5265.36 --> 5270.92
when i'm outside even if i did have

5267.36 --> 5270.92
wireless capability

5289.6 --> 5294.8
why anyone likes to use archaic language

5292.32 --> 5297.5199999999995
to quote the bible defeats me

5294.8 --> 5299.6
really you don't understand

5297.52 --> 5301.84
it's because

5299.6 --> 5304.08
language was more sophisticated back

5301.84 --> 5304.08
then

5304.48 --> 5310.32
and

5305.44 --> 5313.5199999999995
it's old so it has more value

5310.32 --> 5315.36
it's intuitive it's impressive

5313.52 --> 5316.400000000001
people do that because

5315.36 --> 5318.799999999999
it just

5316.4 --> 5321.839999999999
gives them weight like this is not

5318.8 --> 5323.1990000000005
something we just made up right now this

5321.84 --> 5324.56
is old

5323.199 --> 5325.919999999999
language

5324.56 --> 5329.120000000001
so they like it of course they're going

5325.92 --> 5331.36
to use that i would use that i love that

5329.12 --> 5334.639
the like speaketh and all that i love

5331.36 --> 5337.639
that old [ __ ] i love old english i love

5334.639 --> 5337.639
it

5339.92 --> 5343.1990000000005
i mean i can't really speak english like

5342.32 --> 5345.759999999999
that

5343.199 --> 5348.08
but i'm always like thrilled to hear it

5345.76 --> 5349.84
as long as it's actually about something

5348.08 --> 5352.4
meaningful and not just pointless

5349.84 --> 5352.400000000001
blabbering

5355.76 --> 5358.08
i mean

5358.32 --> 5362.719
shakespeare is pretty cool

5360.96 --> 5366.4800000000005
lingual wise

5362.719 --> 5371.04
but there's a lot of blabbering going on

5366.48 --> 5371.04
so eventually i kind of get bored

5377.28 --> 5381.84
no i'm not going to do that rufus saint

5379.36 --> 5381.839999999999
hubbins

5387.679 --> 5390.0
dude

5390.56 --> 5398.320000000001
i barely go out and communicate at all

5395.12 --> 5400.639
flat smacking is not gonna be my thing

5398.32 --> 5400.639
okay

5404.0 --> 5409.679
i'm gonna get caught up in flat earth

5406.32 --> 5412.159
then it just is because it just by

5409.679 --> 5413.92
accident came along in the conversation

5412.159 --> 5417.12
and that's when i will step in and say

5413.92 --> 5417.12
like yeah i'm an expert

5417.28 --> 5423.36
you can ask me any question technical

5421.04 --> 5424.8
or otherwise as long as it's not pure

5423.36 --> 5426.48
math

5424.8 --> 5428.159000000001
and i'll argue that i'll argue

5426.48 --> 5430.0
philosophy i'll argue the meaning of

5428.159 --> 5432.799999999999
words i'll argue

5430.0 --> 5435.12
scientific evidence i'll argue anything

5432.8 --> 5437.84
but i'm not a flat smacker i'm not just

5435.12 --> 5440.08
like oh look at me oh you're the flat

5437.84 --> 5443.6
earth it's so special oh

5440.08 --> 5443.6
it's pointless to me

5445.84 --> 5449.12
to me though you know if other people

5447.52 --> 5453.120000000001
like doing that and they're good at it

5449.12 --> 5455.199
go go ahead i'm not stopping you

5453.12 --> 5457.84
just realize that there's people out

5455.199 --> 5459.839999999999
there that really don't want to know and

5457.84 --> 5461.84
if you're going to push it on them

5459.84 --> 5463.360000000001
and then in my view you're committing a

5461.84 --> 5465.4400000000005
minor sin

5463.36 --> 5469.639
you're disrupting their life

5465.44 --> 5469.638999999999
so be careful what you do

5483.36 --> 5487.04
in england we speak like that one being

5485.36 --> 5490.36
sarcastically yeah of course you are

5487.04 --> 5490.36
that's logical

5529.44 --> 5533.759999999999
some flat earth christians are [ __ ]

5531.76 --> 5536.08
rufus and hubbard's

5533.76 --> 5539.12
and by the way in general a lot of

5536.08 --> 5540.8
christians are [ __ ] they don't know

5539.12 --> 5542.32
what the [ __ ] they're doing they're

5540.8 --> 5545.320000000001
following a code that they don't

5542.32 --> 5545.32
understand

5546.8 --> 5552.719
in my opinion anybody that just says oh

5549.92 --> 5555.36
if you do this you go to hell

5552.719 --> 5557.679
immediately you failed

5555.36 --> 5559.759999999999
it's complete and utter failure of

5557.679 --> 5562.76
understanding

5559.76 --> 5562.76
immediately

5566.2 --> 5569.26
[Music]

5575.04 --> 5580.32
right but hey if you're gonna go on a

5577.92 --> 5582.0
ride of lies if you

5580.32 --> 5583.84
know it's not a ball but you're still

5582.0 --> 5587.12
gonna stick to it for

5583.84 --> 5589.92
authority power money

5587.12 --> 5592.5599999999995
well that may definitely send you on a

5589.92 --> 5594.2390000000005
route to hell it it's gonna deliver you

5592.56 --> 5595.6
the punishment

5594.239 --> 5598.159
the price

5595.6 --> 5600.4800000000005
for your sins within your life for sure

5598.159 --> 5600.48
right

5601.6 --> 5606.96
but just believing in the ball

5605.04 --> 5608.4
is not a sin

5606.96 --> 5609.84
it's like what are you going to do with

5608.4 --> 5612.48
that belief

5609.84 --> 5617.04
what is it going to drive you to do

5612.48 --> 5619.12
that's the thing that matters right

5617.04 --> 5621.36
like

5619.12 --> 5621.36
yeah

5621.52 --> 5626.320000000001
that's in the end the actions that you

5623.679 --> 5628.56
do with it and like the feelings that

5626.32 --> 5630.32
you unleash upon yourself

5628.56 --> 5632.8
that's the thing that really matters

5630.32 --> 5632.799999999999
about it

5633.28 --> 5638.8
not whether you believe in a chant thing

5636.32 --> 5640.239
or if you're on the wrong side of some

5638.8 --> 5641.28
argument

5640.239 --> 5644.599999999999
yeah

5641.28 --> 5644.599999999999
that's ridiculous

5644.88 --> 5651.719
it's just like pecking order talk that's

5647.04 --> 5651.719
not spiritual it's very primitive

5672.97 --> 5676.009
[Music]

5681.199 --> 5684.48
yeah

5682.32 --> 5686.799999999999
yeah kind of bear it is game over it is

5684.48 --> 5688.638999999999
game of for the globe

5686.8 --> 5691.119000000001
it was for a while

5688.639 --> 5694.32
all they got now is a lot of space to

5691.119 --> 5697.759999999999
keep on fantasizing and they got

5694.32 --> 5702.84
cgi art support right to reinforce that

5697.76 --> 5702.84
which is known to be incorrect now

5719.6 --> 5725.119000000001
you're going to watch the cup what are

5722.4 --> 5725.119
you talking about

5726.0 --> 5729.119
you mean

5727.52 --> 5731.119000000001
like soccer

5729.119 --> 5733.28
is there an international competition

5731.119 --> 5735.5199999999995
thing again

5733.28 --> 5737.5199999999995
all right sure i'll watch that i like

5735.52 --> 5739.679
watching international

5737.52 --> 5741.280000000001
soccer competition that's like the only

5739.679 --> 5743.4400000000005
thing really about it that i like to

5741.28 --> 5745.119
watch i don't like following clubs and

5743.44 --> 5747.119
all that [ __ ]

5745.119 --> 5750.44
so yeah sure if there's one again i'll

5747.119 --> 5750.44
watch it

5762.639 --> 5765.679
world cup all right

5768.239 --> 5773.44
how does gps work uh

5770.8 --> 5775.92
it's a triangulation system based on

5773.44 --> 5775.919999999999
towers

5777.84 --> 5780.4800000000005
so they just

5780.96 --> 5787.199
scan and then feedback how much distance

5784.56 --> 5789.280000000001
derived from the signal feedback

5787.199 --> 5791.759999999999
and they do that at three spots and then

5789.28 --> 5793.119
they can by deriving the distance

5791.76 --> 5795.04
measured

5793.119 --> 5796.719
pinpoint exactly where you are

5795.04 --> 5799.84
mathematically

5796.719 --> 5799.84
and it works

5803.44 --> 5807.919999999999
will robots ever become mainstream and

5806.08 --> 5810.4
be used to perform menial tasks in

5807.92 --> 5812.4800000000005
people's household no

5810.4 --> 5814.879999999999
except to keep them in line

5812.48 --> 5817.759999999999
against their will

5814.88 --> 5820.719
that might happen if yeah if it all gets

5817.76 --> 5823.360000000001
to that if people decide that they all

5820.719 --> 5825.92
want to collectively go extinct for no

5823.36 --> 5828.5599999999995
damn reason and let complete demons

5825.92 --> 5830.56
destroy everything yes then there might

5828.56 --> 5832.320000000001
be robots eventually in your household

5830.56 --> 5834.96
that will start to dictate to you what

5832.32 --> 5836.48
to do and spy on you yeah that might

5834.96 --> 5840.08
happen

5836.48 --> 5842.239
but that old futurist idea of like oh

5840.08 --> 5844.239
you could just sit back and robots will

5842.239 --> 5846.879999999999
do everything good [ __ ] luck with

5844.239 --> 5849.199
that yeah we live in a world where the

5846.88 --> 5852.88
people with all the power and money want

5849.199 --> 5854.4
to exterminate mankind okay

5852.88 --> 5857.04
it's not gonna happen

5854.4 --> 5859.28
stop wasting your freaking fantasy time

5857.04 --> 5861.84
on that [ __ ]

5859.28 --> 5863.44
why would you want robots to do

5861.84 --> 5866.56
everything for you

5863.44 --> 5867.839999999999
the ability to learn skills and how to

5866.56 --> 5870.2390000000005
do things

5867.84 --> 5873.119000000001
is like the best thing ever why would

5870.239 --> 5875.36
you want to reject that in favor of

5873.119 --> 5878.5599999999995
having stupid robots do everything for

5875.36 --> 5881.44
you it's the dumbest thing ever

5878.56 --> 5885.119000000001
it's laziness it's sloth it's stupid

5881.44 --> 5885.919999999999
it's impractical robots break down

5885.119 --> 5889.839999999999
yeah

5885.92 --> 5892.2390000000005
robots break down faster than humans do

5889.84 --> 5895.04
robots are more difficult to program and

5892.239 --> 5897.839999999999
reprogram than humans

5895.04 --> 5897.84
it's pointless

5905.84 --> 5908.2390000000005
i mean

5908.32 --> 5912.88
human beings regenerate

5910.56 --> 5914.719
when robots break

5912.88 --> 5916.96
they don't work anymore

5914.719 --> 5919.199
and then a specialized repairman has to

5916.96 --> 5921.52
fix it replace parts

5919.199 --> 5924.159
and then maybe if you're lucky it'll

5921.52 --> 5926.400000000001
work again

5924.159 --> 5926.4
yeah

5926.96 --> 5932.719
so unless you're a

5929.52 --> 5935.119000000001
robot loving repair guy that's just like

5932.719 --> 5936.719
robots robots robots yeah okay if you're

5935.119 --> 5939.92
a guy like that that just loves robot

5936.719 --> 5941.52
robots robots yeah i don't mind if you

5939.92 --> 5943.52
then are like yeah oh look at all these

5941.52 --> 5945.280000000001
gadgets that i made and they helped me

5943.52 --> 5948.2390000000005
in my household i'd be like

5945.28 --> 5951.679
dude you're good with robotics

5948.239 --> 5955.678999999999
that's not gonna be the [ __ ] standard

5951.679 --> 5957.6
for every lazy [ __ ] okay it's never

5955.679 --> 5961.679
gonna happen ever

5957.6 --> 5961.679
who the [ __ ] is gonna fix all that [ __ ]

5962.0 --> 5965.36
nobody

5963.199 --> 5966.879999999999
there's not enough people to fix all

5965.36 --> 5969.199
those robots that are going to break

5966.88 --> 5972.0
down constantly there's literally not

5969.199 --> 5974.638999999999
enough people capable of doing that at

6046.719 --> 6051.119
debates which should be going live any

6049.04 --> 6053.84
second now

6051.119 --> 6054.639
hope to see you all in chat there over

6053.84 --> 6057.679
at

6054.639 --> 6060.0
nathan oakley 1980 channel

6057.679 --> 6060.0
right

6062.32 --> 6066.48
is there any place inside where robots

6064.08 --> 6067.84
are actually useful yes

6066.48 --> 6070.5599999999995
yes there are

6067.84 --> 6072.96
places that are for example extremely

6070.56 --> 6072.96
toxic

6073.199 --> 6075.599999999999
or

6074.08 --> 6078.48
in things that are extremely

6075.6 --> 6079.280000000001
demoralizing like repetitive actions

6078.48 --> 6082.239
right

6079.28 --> 6084.48
so robots are still very useful in

6082.239 --> 6086.4
factories and they are widely employed

6084.48 --> 6090.159
there it's just

6086.4 --> 6092.08
it usually also needs a human touch

6090.159 --> 6093.839999999999
and the more robots are used in

6092.08 --> 6097.6
factories the more

6093.84 --> 6098.96
repair guys need to be good at repairing

6097.6 --> 6101.119000000001
them

6098.96 --> 6104.08
so anyway

6101.119 --> 6106.48
just to answer that final question

6104.08 --> 6109.34
right so until the next video

6106.48 --> 6140.639999999999
keep it flat

6109.34 --> 6140.64
[Music]

6163.76 --> 6165.84
you
