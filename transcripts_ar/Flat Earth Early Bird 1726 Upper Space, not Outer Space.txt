109.439 --> 114.41999999999999
continually raining

111.78 --> 116.759
not raining super hard but still it's

114.42 --> 119.36
yeah super dreary it's been raining

116.759 --> 119.36
continually

121.74 --> 125.29899999999999
since it started this morning

131.64 --> 137.04
all right well at least the

133.8 --> 140.36
hard wind is kind of stopped that was

137.04 --> 140.35999999999999
just getting annoying

140.4 --> 144.37900000000002
but man it does really feel like it's

142.92 --> 146.599
Autumn

144.379 --> 149.099
uh

146.599 --> 151.07999999999998
oh well

149.099 --> 154.2
right

151.08 --> 157.20000000000002
it is Thursday the 21st of September

154.2 --> 157.2
2023

158.58 --> 163.4
temperatures probably gonna be like 17

160.98 --> 163.39999999999998
degrees

164.4 --> 168.8
16. well close enough

171.14 --> 177.77999999999997
it says it's gonna get a bit warmer

175.5 --> 181.319
during the weekend

177.78 --> 184.62
and then next week so that could be nice

181.319 --> 187.57999999999998
but it seems like the coming few days

184.62 --> 194.0
it's gonna be very rainy and cloudy and

187.58 --> 194.0
around 16 17 degrees so oh well

209.159 --> 215.159
let me share the show so somebody might

212.099 --> 218.23899999999998
actually show up in the chat

215.159 --> 218.239
that would be great

221.61 --> 224.62900000000002
[Music]

let's see here

262.17 --> 265.249
[Music]

288.3 --> 292.22
yeah it seems everything is fine

294.54 --> 300.0
because I was checking yesterday and

296.58 --> 305.06
like immediately after the stream ended

300.0 --> 305.06
and Godzilla was on the list again

305.82 --> 310.09999999999997
I don't know how the [ __ ] that's even

307.5 --> 310.1
happening

310.5 --> 317.52
he's not in there here now right so who

313.68 --> 320.52
the [ __ ] is doing that how

317.52 --> 323.9
pretty sure that in yesterday's Chad

320.52 --> 323.9
Godzilla is still there

324.9 --> 327.919
check for a second

334.919 --> 339.25899999999996
Godzilla was there in the chat yesterday

342.0 --> 344.9
what the [ __ ]

354.06 --> 356.78000000000003
no

357.419 --> 362.57
how the hell this is happening who the

360.419 --> 365.779
[ __ ] banned Godzilla

362.57 --> 365.779
[Music]

379.32 --> 382.32
right

384.0 --> 387.199
this is just weird

387.65 --> 392.039
[Music]

389.52 --> 394.85999999999996
next time he shows up I'm gonna give him

392.039 --> 398.34
a wrench I'm gonna give him a wrench

394.86 --> 400.56
just so he doesn't get banned

398.34 --> 404.17999999999995
by somebody

400.56 --> 404.18
that I don't know who that is

409.319 --> 412.759
right anyway

415.039 --> 420.56
yeah yesterday's show I thought it was

417.6 --> 420.56
actually really good

421.319 --> 426.319
I did what I wanted to do and I did it

423.72 --> 426.319
very well

432.27 --> 435.59999999999997
[Music]

438.24 --> 442.5
yeah today I don't really have something

440.4 --> 444.65999999999997
planned or anything

442.5 --> 448.699
I'm just gonna be happy if somebody's

444.66 --> 448.699
gonna show up in my chat

449.28 --> 452.71999999999997
that isn't a troll

475.38 --> 480.599
or maybe today is just one of those days

477.84 --> 482.75899999999996
where literally everybody's an hour late

480.599 --> 485.419
maybe it's one of those days I mean it

482.759 --> 485.41900000000004
is rainy

486.419 --> 489.25899999999996

[Music]

542.16 --> 544.5799999999999
thank you

547.2 --> 549.38
foreign

555.54 --> 560.459
okay well in the meantime let's talk

558.72 --> 563.5400000000001
about how the Earth is absolutely

560.459 --> 563.54
measured flat

563.88 --> 568.56
and the entire glow bottle is all based

567.36 --> 571.74
off

568.56 --> 573.779
flat plane geometry let's just talk

571.74 --> 576.9590000000001
about that I mean nobody's here in the

573.779 --> 579.3
chat except for trolls so wow just tell

576.959 --> 580.9799999999999
them how they're [ __ ] wrong and they

579.3 --> 582.7199999999999
always will be wrong and there's nothing

580.98 --> 585.6
they can make up

582.72 --> 588.4200000000001
peer pressure distract bully

585.6 --> 592.08
to make that stop that the Earth is

588.42 --> 594.66
absolutely inevitably flat

592.08 --> 597.08
there's nothing that can ever change

594.66 --> 597.0799999999999
that

598.44 --> 601.7600000000001
nothing ever

602.339 --> 608.58
yeah not even the the increasing

605.7 --> 611.4590000000001
retardation of the entirety of humanity

608.58 --> 613.98
is going to not make the earth flat

611.459 --> 616.0799999999999
because it is flat it's just that people

613.98 --> 618.12
can be very delusional and very

616.08 --> 622.38
distracted and not

618.12 --> 625.8
believe it's flat because everything

622.38 --> 628.56
they're told tells them that it can't be

625.8 --> 631.3199999999999
flat and that you're stupid and bad if

628.56 --> 633.2399999999999
you say it's flat

631.32 --> 635.22
or that you're hateful towards some

633.24 --> 637.86
group or something right

635.22 --> 641.0400000000001
yeah that's cute but it is absolutely

637.86 --> 643.44
measured flat and the entire Globe model

641.04 --> 645.98
is constructed based off flat plane

643.44 --> 645.98
geometry

646.079 --> 653.2199999999999
so and that's really why I don't even

649.56 --> 654.54
talk too much about it on my own show I

653.22 --> 656.1600000000001
mostly leave it for the Flat Earth

654.54 --> 659.8199999999999
debates

656.16 --> 661.98
because well they'd love to say that

659.82 --> 664.32
over and over and over and over and over

661.98 --> 667.74
again especially Johnny like wants to

664.32 --> 672.0600000000001
say it at least five times the show

667.74 --> 673.32
for like the last month so hey that's

672.06 --> 676.26
their thing

673.32 --> 678.72
and then that just leaves a room for me

676.26 --> 681.3
to talk about other things hello Richard

678.72 --> 684.5600000000001
G first in chat

681.3 --> 684.56
it took you so long

686.339 --> 689.899
but yeah good to see you

704.1 --> 709.64
I was up a bit late okay fair enough

733.62 --> 737.36
right anyway hope you're doing okay

738.38 --> 743.9399999999999
I don't know if like I talked with fiber

741.6 --> 746.779
Ortiz not doing great

743.94 --> 746.7790000000001
it's like

747.72 --> 754.2
seems to like having a bit of a feed

750.36 --> 758.12
like a nervous feedback

754.2 --> 758.12
Loop not not great

758.519 --> 763.5600000000001
this life is seems to be a little bit

760.62 --> 766.139
into chaos right now but I yeah I gave

763.56 --> 770.06
him some basic tips and just like just

766.139 --> 770.0600000000001
don't make rash decisions

771.18 --> 775.92
but uh yeah I wish you all the best five

773.94 --> 778.62
routes I really hope your life gets back

775.92 --> 780.779
on the rails soon

778.62 --> 783.32
even though those rails might be kind of

780.779 --> 783.32
new rails

789.8 --> 793.279
you do too

796.019 --> 798.86
do what

806.399 --> 813.309
oh right yeah yeah anyway

810.25 --> 813.309
[Music]

813.32 --> 817.62
here I'm gonna take a bite of that

815.76 --> 819.42
because I'm really freaking hungry which

817.62 --> 821.4590000000001
is weird because I had a really big meal

819.42 --> 822.5999999999999
yesterday but still hungry for some

821.459 --> 826.7399999999999
reason

822.6 --> 826.74
okay fine cheers

832.78 --> 835.929
[Music]

845.519 --> 848.18
hmm

856.32 --> 864.32
I look like I had some troll action yeah

860.339 --> 864.32
I'm not even gonna mention them

865.019 --> 869.54
yeah trolls aren't going to be first in

867.3 --> 869.54
chat

869.579 --> 874.68
I will just

871.139 --> 876.779
kick them out and ignore them and

874.68 --> 879.06
nobody will ever know that they were

876.779 --> 881.399
there when they watch back

879.06 --> 882.66
and that's a good thing

881.399 --> 885.54
because

882.66 --> 888.8
nobody should know that they're there

885.54 --> 888.8
they shouldn't be there

889.26 --> 893.88
people like that shouldn't be there at

891.959 --> 896.5999999999999
all ever

893.88 --> 896.6
anywhere

901.38 --> 906.54
but yeah some [ __ ] [ __ ] out there

903.839 --> 909.3000000000001
on the internet made another video about

906.54 --> 911.04
me whatever it's you can't even barely

909.3 --> 915.4799999999999
call it a video I mean this is like

911.04 --> 918.06
below Sean Hawkins level

915.48 --> 921.1800000000001
it's so [ __ ] lame like

918.06 --> 924.5999999999999
I couldn't even properly report it for

921.18 --> 928.68
bullying because it was just so [ __ ]

924.6 --> 930.66
lame it was just so lame

928.68 --> 934.079
there was technically just nothing to

930.66 --> 937.1
report it was just [ __ ] [ __ ] like

934.079 --> 937.0999999999999
nothing was there

937.32 --> 942.4200000000001
it's just some cowardly backstabbing

939.959 --> 944.9399999999999
troll [ __ ] face

942.42 --> 949.279
who's too [ __ ]

944.94 --> 949.2790000000001
actually face people

952.74 --> 956.24
it's Sean Hawkins [ __ ]

956.88 --> 962.76
except John Hawkins well at least like

960.3 --> 964.9799999999999
come on camera

962.76 --> 967.699
that's the difference this guy's even

964.98 --> 971.48
too scared to do that is just sniveling

967.699 --> 971.4799999999999
gamma [ __ ] face

974.459 --> 980.76
run down little gay pro got run down

977.459 --> 983.76
little rejected gay prostitute flatter

980.76 --> 983.76
yeah

987.24 --> 990.9590000000001
yeah now that you're not a little kid

989.22 --> 993.98
anymore nobody wants to do that anymore

990.959 --> 993.9799999999999
with you do ya

999.24 --> 1001.899
foreign

1012.199 --> 1018.079
and it was ridiculous too I mean

1015.56 --> 1020.3599999999999
he didn't even take a video that was

1018.079 --> 1023.1389999999999
recent like I couldn't even figure out

1020.36 --> 1023.139
which video

1023.839 --> 1029.9
you had cut from it must be months ago

1027.38 --> 1032.6200000000001
because I was looking back and I

1029.9 --> 1032.6200000000001
couldn't find it

1035.54 --> 1041.8999999999999
like the exact combination and like I I

1039.62 --> 1044.059
checked some I spent like 15 minutes

1041.9 --> 1045.799
checking and I just couldn't even find

1044.059 --> 1047.78
it back so I don't even know what stream

1045.799 --> 1052.16
he took it from

1047.78 --> 1055.6
and it doesn't really seem

1052.16 --> 1055.6000000000001
there's just nothing there

1056.6 --> 1061.1599999999999
it's almost like it was just a video

1058.64 --> 1064.1000000000001
about how that was kind of a bit of a

1061.16 --> 1065.66
boring piece or something like oh wow

1064.1 --> 1067.76
wow

1065.66 --> 1069.799
there's anti-flat Earth there's now

1067.76 --> 1072.919
making videos about

1069.799 --> 1076.0
pieces of my show that are boring and

1072.919 --> 1076.0
that's their video now

1078.08 --> 1082.58
so they're making a video about how

1080.48 --> 1084.5
boring my video is

1082.58 --> 1088.52
and that's like all the [ __ ] everybody

1084.5 --> 1092.98
just loves that it's like that video got

1088.52 --> 1092.98
thousands of views that's [ __ ]

1093.799 --> 1098.02
like that's literally [ __ ]

1114.62 --> 1119.78
like either there's a lot of [ __ ]

1117.38 --> 1121.7600000000002
numpties out there or that's just all

1119.78 --> 1124.1
those [ __ ] troll accounts I think

1121.76 --> 1126.62
they're just fake I think they really

1124.1 --> 1129.74
are fake robots

1126.62 --> 1132.32
they're like the fake sjw robots that's

1129.74 --> 1134.66
supposed to like escape the landscape

1132.32 --> 1136.76
for YouTube to get

1134.66 --> 1139.039
things that contradict with its

1136.76 --> 1141.08
narrative out of the way

1139.039 --> 1142.82
I'm really starting to think that that's

1141.08 --> 1146.559
what they are because none of them

1142.82 --> 1146.559
actually seem like human beings

1150.5 --> 1155.84
they're just bought filler bought filler

1153.799 --> 1158.1399999999999
people I don't think they're even real

1155.84 --> 1158.1399999999999
people

1166.22 --> 1171.559
like how can that many people like even

1169.64 --> 1174.679
be against me

1171.559 --> 1176.72
like why would they even care

1174.679 --> 1179.3600000000001
I don't get it

1176.72 --> 1182.419
it seems like a setup it really does

1179.36 --> 1186.28
seem like it's just an act

1182.419 --> 1186.2800000000002
like that that can't be real

1195.64 --> 1203.3600000000001
anyway it doesn't really matter anyhow

1200.12 --> 1206.0
dude you could have a [ __ ] million

1203.36 --> 1207.86
subscribers and a hundred million views

1206.0 --> 1211.299
for all I care

1207.86 --> 1214.52
it doesn't make his video absolutely

1211.299 --> 1216.86
[ __ ] any less

1214.52 --> 1219.32
it's [ __ ] [ __ ] it's [ __ ]

1216.86 --> 1221.6599999999999
boring it's not about anything and

1219.32 --> 1224.1789999999999
nobody gives a [ __ ] in the world

1221.66 --> 1227.24
including me

1224.179 --> 1229.72
I even don't care enough to even do

1227.24 --> 1233.24
anything to about it

1229.72 --> 1236.059
as in the past I mean it's not the first

1233.24 --> 1241.1
troll [ __ ] trying to make videos about

1236.059 --> 1241.1
me that's been happening since 2016.

1243.98 --> 1249.6200000000001
and I've seen a lot worse

1246.44 --> 1252.38
and I took their channels down

1249.62 --> 1254.6789999999999
when they did when it's actually a lot

1252.38 --> 1254.679
worse

1265.16 --> 1269.8600000000001
but making comments on remedies if your

1267.679 --> 1269.8600000000001
videos

1270.38 --> 1274.3600000000001
that's yeah surreal

1286.7 --> 1290.72
so maybe at this point it's just a big

1288.919 --> 1293.679
Pharma Troll Army

1290.72 --> 1296.539
something like that I mean they made

1293.679 --> 1299.419
hundreds of billions

1296.539 --> 1302.36
in a recent few years

1299.419 --> 1305.7800000000002
they have a lot of money to spend and

1302.36 --> 1308.6789999999999
they can absolutely like buy off

1305.78 --> 1308.6789999999999
troll world

1311.059 --> 1314.3799999999999
and they probably have

1316.34 --> 1321.799
and hey I don't know anybody out there

1318.98 --> 1323.1200000000001
that's more anti-big Pharma than little

1321.799 --> 1325.6399999999999
old me

1323.12 --> 1327.26
who's literally stating abolish the

1325.64 --> 1329.7800000000002
entire thing

1327.26 --> 1332.48
the entire medical system should be

1329.78 --> 1335.86
completely abolished

1332.48 --> 1335.8600000000001
start from scratch

1336.98 --> 1341.24
and like leave

1338.659 --> 1344.0
surgical capacity

1341.24 --> 1345.32
for accident situations and plastic

1344.0 --> 1348.32
surgery

1345.32 --> 1350.84
and the rest of it could mostly just

1348.32 --> 1355.539
like be shoved in the bin and gotten rid

1350.84 --> 1355.539
of and potentially persecuted too

1364.28 --> 1367.0
all right

1368.96 --> 1374.0
yes good to see you by the way but I

1372.5 --> 1375.74
mean

1374.0 --> 1379.84
it is just

1375.74 --> 1379.84
like do they really expect like

1385.4 --> 1390.5
I mean they're like like

1387.46 --> 1392.179
suicide enabling Bots

1390.5 --> 1395.48
you think that you could just surround

1392.179 --> 1397.2800000000002
people with not real people that all

1395.48 --> 1400.34
tell them to like oh kill yourself kill

1397.28 --> 1403.46
yourself and that's gonna work on me

1400.34 --> 1405.08
I mean yeah that does work on some

1403.46 --> 1407.0
people out there

1405.08 --> 1410.4189999999999
and when that actually happens the

1407.0 --> 1413.48
police usually actually goes after it

1410.419 --> 1417.5590000000002
does investigation and and trolls do

1413.48 --> 1418.88
actually get arrested when that happens

1417.559 --> 1421.7
[ __ ] face

1418.88 --> 1423.6200000000001
oh you're very lucky that that's never

1421.7 --> 1427.039
gonna happen with me

1423.62 --> 1430.52
because I'm not like a suicidal type

1427.039 --> 1433.94
I'm more of the type that one day I'm

1430.52 --> 1435.799
gonna find out who you are

1433.94 --> 1438.74
and then

1435.799 --> 1441.1589999999999
just out of nowhere you're just going to

1438.74 --> 1441.159
disappear

1442.76 --> 1447.919
and nobody will even care

1446.539 --> 1450.32
huh

1447.919 --> 1452.7990000000002
so don't worry about little old me I'll

1450.32 --> 1452.799
be all right

1453.26 --> 1455.799
huh

1456.2 --> 1459.279
[Music]

1463.76 --> 1466.799
[Music]

1485.24 --> 1487.9
anyway

1487.94 --> 1489.94
um

1490.7 --> 1496.659
hey seems like the rain is dying down

1494.12 --> 1496.6589999999999
good

1499.46 --> 1503.299
yeah

1500.799 --> 1505.96
I'm still feeling pretty good despite

1503.299 --> 1505.96
the shitty weather

1506.26 --> 1510.86
that

1507.86 --> 1513.9189999999999
the treatment my healer gave me

1510.86 --> 1517.039
yesterday over the phone yeah it did

1513.919 --> 1519.3200000000002
absolutely do Miracles I mean it always

1517.039 --> 1521.36
does but this time

1519.32 --> 1524.36
it had been

1521.36 --> 1525.74
what is it two two months straight

1524.36 --> 1528.62
pretty much

1525.74 --> 1531.82
since I even like contacted him which is

1528.62 --> 1531.82
like a very long time

1531.919 --> 1536.1200000000001
in between

1533.779 --> 1538.1
that I just chose to completely take

1536.12 --> 1542.0
care of try to take care of it all

1538.1 --> 1545.8999999999999
myself and it did actually kind of work

1542.0 --> 1549.919
not perfectly this was provable

1545.9 --> 1551.6000000000001
uh the day before yesterday

1549.919 --> 1553.9
because I got completely knocked out of

1551.6 --> 1553.8999999999999
my body

1554.419 --> 1557.26
but yeah

1557.6 --> 1563.1999999999998
I just I still feel pretty good and

1560.299 --> 1563.2
focused and strong

1564.74 --> 1568.94
despite being a little annoyed on

1567.08 --> 1570.799
average

1568.94 --> 1573.22
with all the stupid troll whining

1570.799 --> 1573.22
everywhere

1586.84 --> 1593.12
so you were going to see him him who's

1591.26 --> 1598.059
him

1593.12 --> 1598.059
a bit more regularly in the past

1605.779 --> 1611.48
get more done done

1608.659 --> 1614.5590000000002
just call them him

1611.48 --> 1614.559
oh healer

1616.76 --> 1622.46
I was going to see now what I did

1619.94 --> 1626.9
well I called him quite a few times in

1622.46 --> 1630.64
the past like on a weekly basis really

1626.9 --> 1630.64
and in the beginning even more

1631.159 --> 1634.779
when I was not doing great

1635.659 --> 1642.0800000000002
around like 2016-17

1639.26 --> 1645.44
but uh

1642.08 --> 1647.72
that these days I don't really need

1645.44 --> 1650.72
his services that much because I can

1647.72 --> 1652.88
like mostly take care of it myself

1650.72 --> 1655.76
like I know what to do I know how to

1652.88 --> 1658.159
focus I know how to like

1655.76 --> 1661.039
shift my frequency

1658.159 --> 1664.46
I'm just hyper aware of the whole thing

1661.039 --> 1669.4
for myself like that's a primary focus

1664.46 --> 1669.4
for me it's like how am I in my body

1669.919 --> 1672.64
foreign

1685.96 --> 1690.44
it's draining yes

1692.48 --> 1696.5
well the problem is is with Hyper

1694.4 --> 1700.72
awareness is that you need some

1696.5 --> 1700.72
constructive routine to deal with it

1704.299 --> 1709.58
it's like if you have hyper awareness

1706.58 --> 1713.8999999999999
but nothing to do with it as in nothing

1709.58 --> 1715.9399999999998
you can literally actively do with it

1713.9 --> 1717.5
then it's just gonna suck because it's

1715.94 --> 1719.72
just gonna shove things in your face

1717.5 --> 1720.679
that you one don't know how to deal with

1719.72 --> 1724.159
to

1720.679 --> 1726.2
you don't really want to know

1724.159 --> 1728.1200000000001
I know all about that

1726.2 --> 1731.8400000000001
so you need to

1728.12 --> 1734.6589999999999
deal with it basically

1731.84 --> 1737.299
the biggest thing about hyper uh

1734.659 --> 1739.5200000000002
perception

1737.299 --> 1742.72
is that you need to have it mostly off

1739.52 --> 1747.26
and this is like almost

1742.72 --> 1750.679
parallel with how telepathy is regarded

1747.26 --> 1753.32
even like in story format right I mean

1750.679 --> 1755.0
look at any science fiction theory that

1753.32 --> 1757.9399999999998
has telepathy in it

1755.0 --> 1760.039
it's always about oh you need to be able

1757.94 --> 1761.8400000000001
to block it out and then if that doesn't

1760.039 --> 1764.72
work you go crazy because you hear

1761.84 --> 1768.86
voices in your head right well

1764.72 --> 1771.44
sensitivity is kind of the same thing

1768.86 --> 1773.84
you need to actually be able to

1771.44 --> 1776.24
continually protect yourself from the

1773.84 --> 1780.62
information that arrives

1776.24 --> 1782.6
with you and not with other people

1780.62 --> 1785.539
so you have to actually protect yourself

1782.6 --> 1787.8799999999999
more against it than

1785.539 --> 1791.3799999999999
just like oh I need to dig it you need

1787.88 --> 1791.38
to keep digging whatever is coming

1791.539 --> 1796.64
it's good to be able to dig

1794.12 --> 1800.1999999999998
when you actually see an opportunity but

1796.64 --> 1800.2
you mostly need to be very

1800.24 --> 1806.1200000000001
like deflective about it otherwise

1803.779 --> 1807.98
you're going to just get

1806.12 --> 1809.6589999999999
you're gonna have a nervous breakdown if

1807.98 --> 1812.559
you don't

1809.659 --> 1812.5590000000002
in this world

1814.7 --> 1817.299
right

1832.94 --> 1839.059
you were in England right Richard G

1836.899 --> 1842.5
or was it the United States I'm not sure

1839.059 --> 1842.5
anymore or Canada

1847.58 --> 1852.6399999999999
I mean I wish I just gave you like

1850.52 --> 1855.86
direct contact with my healer but I mean

1852.64 --> 1857.659
I Canada right but he's probably just

1855.86 --> 1859.6999999999998
not gonna do International stuff he

1857.659 --> 1863.5
might do it like one time

1859.7 --> 1863.5
but that's basically one time

1865.82 --> 1871.8799999999999
it might still be very helpful one time

1869.36 --> 1874.399
I mean one time can absolutely change

1871.88 --> 1876.6200000000001
your life if it's never if it's been

1874.399 --> 1879.02
like that for a long time

1876.62 --> 1880.34
that you're like cut off in a way or

1879.02 --> 1882.86
over sensitive

1880.34 --> 1884.72
then just one time can like really put

1882.86 --> 1888.82
it back into place and then it's up to

1884.72 --> 1888.82
you to keep it that way for yourself

1889.179 --> 1896.3600000000001
foreign but yeah the next time I'm gonna

1893.179 --> 1898.8200000000002
talk with my healer again I will try to

1896.36 --> 1901.58
remember to bring you up

1898.82 --> 1903.76
see if he can remotely check here at

1901.58 --> 1903.76
least

1911.24 --> 1913.659
right

1924.44 --> 1928.76
oh man

1926.36 --> 1930.02
wouldn't you rather be watching flat

1928.76 --> 1932.899
derp now

1930.02 --> 1935.24
those brilliant videos with like a

1932.899 --> 1938.0
thousand hits

1935.24 --> 1941.559
I mean it's such great material man who

1938.0 --> 1941.559
wouldn't want to watch that

1942.32 --> 1947.0
I mean it's literally a highlighted

1944.779 --> 1949.46
piece of video of me

1947.0 --> 1951.5
talking about something

1949.46 --> 1954.08
that's like

1951.5 --> 1956.12
just as an isolated clip it's not even

1954.08 --> 1958.46
interesting like it's not even

1956.12 --> 1960.7399999999998
interesting

1958.46 --> 1963.32
and like you can barely even get the

1960.74 --> 1965.659
context of what I'm talking about as a

1963.32 --> 1968.1789999999999
whole out of that stupid clip I mean

1965.659 --> 1970.5390000000002
wouldn't you rather want to watch that

1968.179 --> 1970.539
video

1972.08 --> 1975.58
then my Daily Show

1977.12 --> 1980.9799999999998
hello Dr utker good to see you

1986.31 --> 1991.34
[Music]

1988.82 --> 1993.3799999999999
I mean a guy that doesn't even make

1991.34 --> 1995.24
videos every day and when he does he

1993.38 --> 1997.22
rips it from somebody else and then

1995.24 --> 2001.08
whines about him

1997.22 --> 2001.08
and he doesn't even stream every day

2002.38 --> 2005.679
and that's what you're going to be a fan

2004.12 --> 2010.26
of

2005.679 --> 2010.26
I mean that seriously can't be real

2010.48 --> 2014.74

2017.08 --> 2022.6589999999999
be that many retards out there that all

2019.72 --> 2025.5
are just so hateful towards me like that

2022.659 --> 2025.5
can't be real

2026.14 --> 2030.64
actual retards have better things to do

2028.659 --> 2033.1200000000001
with their life

2030.64 --> 2033.1200000000001

flat derps butt hurt video yeah I guess

2040.059 --> 2045.22
is it butt hurt

2041.919 --> 2046.96
was it even bother I I didn't get the

2045.22 --> 2049.7200000000003
point of the video

2046.96 --> 2050.379
doctor okay did you get a point out of

2049.72 --> 2052.5989999999997
it

2050.379 --> 2054.2799999999997
I'd love to hear your explanation I

2052.599 --> 2056.02
didn't get it I just didn't get the

2054.28 --> 2058.2400000000002
video I was like

2056.02 --> 2060.94
it's just like Sean Hawkins trying to

2058.24 --> 2063.9689999999996
make a point it's like

2060.94 --> 2065.919
talking about like this is not a point

2063.969 --> 2068.44
[Music]

2065.919 --> 2071.56
I don't get it

2068.44 --> 2074.56
it's worth thousands of views though

2071.56 --> 2074.56
yes

2079.54 --> 2085.379
but Dr utker could you explain to me

2081.7 --> 2085.379
what the point was of the video

2090.58 --> 2096.5989999999997
all for the view so he's just stealing

2092.919 --> 2096.5989999999997
my material then for views

2101.38 --> 2106.1800000000003
I mean if there's absolutely no point

2103.66 --> 2107.7999999999997
and it's not even funny

2106.18 --> 2110.2599999999998
then

2107.8 --> 2113.8
the word derp going viral you're welcome

2110.26 --> 2115.3
yeah kind of see yourself what it is a

2113.8 --> 2116.76
bit

2115.3 --> 2120.1600000000003
okay

2116.76 --> 2121.6600000000003
you own that one for sure maybe you

2120.16 --> 2124.14
should just copy right strike his

2121.66 --> 2124.14
channel name

2126.46 --> 2132.579
I mean yeah but

2130.18 --> 2135.3999999999996
if you guys can manage to like report

2132.579 --> 2137.02
these [ __ ] for doing that

2135.4 --> 2140.92
that will be cool

2137.02 --> 2143.92
I can't figure it out

2140.92 --> 2145.66
like I need like I need to like if I do

2143.92 --> 2147.64
like a copyright strike I need to know

2145.66 --> 2149.8199999999997
which video it is I couldn't figure it

2147.64 --> 2149.8199999999997
out

2149.92 --> 2153.52
I mean that video could have been from

2151.72 --> 2155.14
like a year ago or something I couldn't

2153.52 --> 2157.3
figure it out which one it was I

2155.14 --> 2158.98
couldn't find it

2157.3 --> 2161.5600000000004
and I mean

2158.98 --> 2165.48
you can't really say he's bullying

2161.56 --> 2165.48
because there's just nothing happening

2170.38 --> 2174.28
right

2171.88 --> 2177.04
anyway if anybody can actually figure

2174.28 --> 2180.88
out which video that was lifted from

2177.04 --> 2183.7
what he made please let me know

2180.88 --> 2186.52
because I couldn't figure it out and I I

2183.7 --> 2189.8999999999996
searched through my through my videos

2186.52 --> 2189.9
for like 15 minutes

2191.56 --> 2193.56
um

2194.02 --> 2199.18
to help out though there's not a lot of

2196.3 --> 2201.6400000000003
videos in which I'm having a white

2199.18 --> 2203.74
T-shirt and loose hair so that

2201.64 --> 2205.5989999999997
combination tightens it down

2203.74 --> 2207.4599999999996
dramatically

2205.599 --> 2209.619
but despite that I still couldn't find

2207.46 --> 2211.54
it

2209.619 --> 2216.359
I had some of those videos where that

2211.54 --> 2216.359
was the case but it wasn't that video

2218.32 --> 2221.579
so whatever

2223.0 --> 2227.38
but yes Dr Whitaker I would like to

2225.52 --> 2230.32
report him for using my material without

2227.38 --> 2232.6600000000003
my consent but I'd have to know what

2230.32 --> 2235.48
material exactly it was I mean it's

2232.66 --> 2238.66
blatantly mine but you have to be

2235.48 --> 2242.579
specific with the URL

2238.66 --> 2242.5789999999997
for copyright strike so

2245.4 --> 2252.339
right anyway it's not even like it's

2249.04 --> 2255.22
this is just cleaning up right

2252.339 --> 2258.64
you need to like do vacuum cleaning

2255.22 --> 2263.9399999999996
every now and then because dirt's gonna

2258.64 --> 2263.94
Heap up and that's what this guy is

2264.099 --> 2268.5
guy or whatever the [ __ ] he is

2275.32 --> 2279.1800000000003
hey Stevie traveler good to see you

2297.0 --> 2301.44
hey Linux good to see you

2349.06 --> 2353.98
all right so I'm I'm basically checking

2351.82 --> 2357.94
my block list on a daily basis now

2353.98 --> 2361.14
because people are just subtly

2357.94 --> 2361.14
getting on there

2364.42 --> 2369.099
like what

2366.88 --> 2372.6400000000003
like Jason McCormack

2369.099 --> 2375.9
didn't I specifically unban him he's in

2372.64 --> 2375.9
there again I don't get it

2382.54 --> 2388.14
it's like how do they just appear back

2385.54 --> 2388.14
on the list

2397.48 --> 2402.54
and clutch what the [ __ ] is clutch doing

2400.0 --> 2402.54
on there

2408.04 --> 2411.18
I don't get it

2424.24 --> 2429.7
yeah Lennox I know

2426.82 --> 2431.5
you're surprised Nathan did that yeah I

2429.7 --> 2433.8999999999996
completely missed out on it which is

2431.5 --> 2435.94
kind of weird I completely missed it

2433.9 --> 2439.3
because I was out for groceries and when

2435.94 --> 2442.0
I came back he was just exactly done

2439.3 --> 2444.94
but he did tell me in the after show

2442.0 --> 2447.579
recording that apparently jiren didn't

2444.94 --> 2450.2200000000003
even do bad

2447.579 --> 2452.6800000000003
so that was kind of funny

2450.22 --> 2454.4199999999996
but yeah thanks for the tip I forwarded

2452.68 --> 2458.56
it and then

2454.42 --> 2461.579
Nathan reviewed it so well done

2458.56 --> 2461.5789999999997
good catch

2470.87 --> 2474.0499999999997
[Music]

2501.839 --> 2507.46
uh Jaren seems fine with Brenda but

2504.82 --> 2509.079
can't do this for mcdoon

2507.46 --> 2511.98
I don't know maybe he's in love with

2509.079 --> 2511.98
matune or something

2517.42 --> 2523.3
and who knows maybe that's actually

2520.119 --> 2525.28
literally real like that sounds like a

2523.3 --> 2527.8
ridiculous joke right but maybe it's

2525.28 --> 2530.2000000000003
real maybe he's secretly a [ __ ]

2527.8 --> 2532.8590000000004
maybe he's secretly like in love with

2530.2 --> 2532.859
miktoon

2535.78 --> 2538.6800000000003
I don't know man

2547.32 --> 2550.32
thank you

2552.42 --> 2559.7200000000003
getting my boat pull a Dash app uh no

2556.599 --> 2561.339
not really landlord there was this guy

2559.72 --> 2563.4399999999996
in chat though

2561.339 --> 2567.5789999999997
but I mean I find him one of the most

2563.44 --> 2570.339
annoying commenters that I've ever seen

2567.579 --> 2572.1400000000003
but he actually said like hey I used to

2570.339 --> 2574.54
play boulder dash a lot and I am

2572.14 --> 2576.64
programmer I'd like to help

2574.54 --> 2579.7
but I basically like told them like yeah

2576.64 --> 2582.46
dude I don't [ __ ] trust you you're

2579.7 --> 2584.56
literally a ball [ __ ] like one of the

2582.46 --> 2586.9
more annoying ones

2584.56 --> 2589.0
but I mean if he's willing to actually

2586.9 --> 2592.119
meet me in person

2589.0 --> 2595.2
face to face then I might consider like

2592.119 --> 2595.2000000000003
working together with him

2598.42 --> 2602.7400000000002
flutter

2599.859 --> 2605.44
what's your favorite proof

2602.74 --> 2608.5
the law of nature is my favorite proof

2605.44 --> 2611.319
yeah natural law is my favorite proof

2608.5 --> 2612.52
yeah natural law the things that happen

2611.319 --> 2615.16
always

2612.52 --> 2619.78
that's my favorite proof

2615.16 --> 2623.46
the law of nature how things are

2619.78 --> 2623.46
which proves the Earth is flat

2624.579 --> 2630.819
yeah disproves the heliocentric model

2628.119 --> 2634.359
SO gas pressure without a container is

2630.819 --> 2636.819
definitely my favorite because it's so

2634.359 --> 2639.64
dramatic and it's so easy to explain

2636.819 --> 2641.859
like any Normie will be shocked when you

2639.64 --> 2644.7
explain this to them like they will be

2641.859 --> 2644.7
every time

2644.74 --> 2650.56
I've never explained the gas pressure

2647.02 --> 2653.56
without a container to any not flat

2650.56 --> 2657.94
Earth understanding person without them

2653.56 --> 2660.5789999999997
like well I've never I've never they

2657.94 --> 2662.44
always are like whoa

2660.579 --> 2666.04
every time

2662.44 --> 2668.7000000000003
because it's so comprehensible it's so

2666.04 --> 2668.7
straightforward

2668.74 --> 2676.72
it's natural law and it's like you have

2671.319 --> 2679.06
to be crazy to even try to deny it as a

2676.72 --> 2682.54
natural law event

2679.06 --> 2684.88
so that one is always

2682.54 --> 2688.56
the best

2684.88 --> 2688.56
weapon to get through

2688.66 --> 2691.74
with newcomers

2696.88 --> 2701.7400000000002
right and then still people might say oh

2699.7 --> 2704.0789999999997
gravity is containing it and then I'll

2701.74 --> 2706.06
go to like oh yeah really so you think

2704.079 --> 2707.8
it's a force well let's just let's just

2706.06 --> 2710.2
say it's still a force even though it

2707.8 --> 2711.819
isn't right let's just not open that

2710.2 --> 2713.02
specific can of worms

2711.819 --> 2716.5
but

2713.02 --> 2718.78
if it's a force well that

2716.5 --> 2721.54
how strong is it

2718.78 --> 2722.98
if it were a force and then you'd like

2721.54 --> 2725.02
go back

2722.98 --> 2727.48
and then everybody remembers it because

2725.02 --> 2728.859
it was all over [ __ ] television and

2727.48 --> 2730.96
like

2728.859 --> 2733.0
History Channel that sort of thing

2730.96 --> 2736.3
Discovery Channel

2733.0 --> 2741.54
like yeah the fundamental forces of the

2736.3 --> 2741.54
universe and like oh entropy force and

2741.78 --> 2746.8
all kinds of forces and

2744.819 --> 2748.839
just physics talk and then you got

2746.8 --> 2750.76
gravity and that guy gravity we're not

2748.839 --> 2752.619
even sure if it's supposed to be in that

2750.76 --> 2754.48
list but if it were it's one of the

2752.619 --> 2756.46
weakest forces

2754.48 --> 2759.76
arguably so weak that it might not even

2756.46 --> 2763.359
exist like that's what they used to say

2759.76 --> 2768.0
so how is that arguably not even a force

2763.359 --> 2771.46
that is super weak supposed to counter

2768.0 --> 2773.2
counteract against the entropy force of

2771.46 --> 2776.079
gas pressure expansion which is

2773.2 --> 2778.48
considered among the strongest powerful

2776.079 --> 2779.98
forces in the universe that's like

2778.48 --> 2782.38
Unstoppable

2779.98 --> 2783.4
yeah that doesn't measure up yeah that's

2782.38 --> 2787.0
like

2783.4 --> 2791.2000000000003
one versus a hundred thousand it's like

2787.0 --> 2794.28
that's never gonna work and people do

2791.2 --> 2794.2799999999997
understand that

2794.56 --> 2798.64
right so it's gas pressure gravity

2797.079 --> 2800.4
contains it it's like oh house is gonna

2798.64 --> 2803.5
do that

2800.4 --> 2807.04
let's sum it up won't we

2803.5 --> 2810.099
let's put the sum to the test there

2807.04 --> 2812.56
and then they realize like yeah yeah

2810.099 --> 2814.9
I thought it did that but I mean yeah

2812.56 --> 2816.72
like mathematically that doesn't make

2814.9 --> 2822.04
any sense really

2816.72 --> 2825.52
right so that's like one of the best

2822.04 --> 2827.859
mechanisms that every single time

2825.52 --> 2831.4
a non-flat earther comes up to me and

2827.859 --> 2834.4
like gets micro triggered or like

2831.4 --> 2837.099
basically rolls out is conditioning

2834.4 --> 2839.38
against the Flat Earth

2837.099 --> 2840.6400000000003
not as an anti-flat Earth but just from

2839.38 --> 2842.5
what they learned from school and

2840.64 --> 2844.66
getting excited and then rolling that

2842.5 --> 2847.48
out what they learned in school

2844.66 --> 2849.94
I always go that route specifically like

2847.48 --> 2852.04
I don't typically bicker about curvature

2849.94 --> 2854.5
or coriolis

2852.04 --> 2857.44
those tend to give me a headache well

2854.5 --> 2860.44
curvature it it's just too confusing for

2857.44 --> 2863.44
newcomers like they can't really get

2860.44 --> 2866.02
their head around it and coriolis is

2863.44 --> 2868.0
literally just confusing as hell

2866.02 --> 2870.88
I mean quite literally there's literally

2868.0 --> 2873.579
a globiolis created just a mock-up

2870.88 --> 2875.5
coriolis understanding

2873.579 --> 2877.599
so

2875.5 --> 2879.94
I usually stick to the gas pressure

2877.599 --> 2883.06
without a container argument as an entry

2879.94 --> 2885.88
and the follow-ups and that really

2883.06 --> 2889.98
really works because there's nothing

2885.88 --> 2889.98
they can do against it nothing

2891.22 --> 2895.8999999999996
Dave mckeagan claimed gas next to a

2893.859 --> 2901.24
vacuum without

2895.9 --> 2904.6600000000003
it yes of course Dave mckegan

2901.24 --> 2907.0
yes yeah he's a [ __ ] [ __ ] and a

2904.66 --> 2909.7
fantasist crazy person

2907.0 --> 2913.18
I mean that guy is literally quite quite

2909.7 --> 2915.3999999999996
naughty at this point

2913.18 --> 2919.1189999999997
he's one of the first people that

2915.4 --> 2922.1800000000003
invented confessional debating

2919.119 --> 2925.6600000000003
where at the end of the video he lays

2922.18 --> 2929.14
down exactly how none of his idea works

2925.66 --> 2932.319
like that's mckigan that started that

2929.14 --> 2934.72
arguably it's the first one I picked it

2932.319 --> 2937.18
up from like picked up that they were

2934.72 --> 2941.2599999999998
doing that

2937.18 --> 2943.1189999999997
when it was getting reviewed on Nathan's

2941.26 --> 2945.3390000000004
um

2943.119 --> 2947.079
so yeah he can claim cash pressure

2945.339 --> 2950.68
without a container all he likes it's

2947.079 --> 2952.0
nonsense like it's not it's natural law

2950.68 --> 2954.46
violating

2952.0 --> 2955.9
there's nothing that can be argued

2954.46 --> 2958.18
against it

2955.9 --> 2960.76
but you can make up a bunch of [ __ ]

2958.18 --> 2962.74
and then trick a bunch of really eager

2960.76 --> 2963.76
dumb people

2962.74 --> 2968.2799999999997
sure

2963.76 --> 2968.28
but it doesn't work it doesn't hold up

2970.24 --> 2974.4399999999996
what's going on with the Titan tops I

2973.48 --> 2976.96
don't know

2974.44 --> 2978.76
I'm not really following him I don't

2976.96 --> 2981.0
know what he's doing is he still even on

2978.76 --> 2981.0
YouTube

2981.4 --> 2985.079
I thought he deleted his channel

2992.02 --> 2997.72
so I don't know what's going on with him

2995.38 --> 3000.619
it's crazy yet good to see you again by

2997.72 --> 3000.6189999999997
the way it's been ages

3012.56 --> 3019.2599999999998
would I ever consider going on mctoon's

3016.619 --> 3023.9
channel to undo the damage Sharon costs

3019.26 --> 3023.9
absolutely not no no no no

3023.94 --> 3027.18
yeah

3025.74 --> 3032.24
I mean

3027.18 --> 3032.24
I don't defend Jaren

3032.64 --> 3038.2999999999997
I don't defend what he's trying to

3035.76 --> 3038.3
accomplish

3038.88 --> 3044.819
I'm not gonna go on mctoon to try to

3041.819 --> 3048.0
like clean up his mess

3044.819 --> 3049.02
no no jaren's gonna have to clean up his

3048.0 --> 3052.5
own mess

3049.02 --> 3056.04
or drown in his own filth

3052.5 --> 3059.579
I'm not cleaning up anything for him

3056.04 --> 3062.16
I definitely don't feel the need to kind

3059.579 --> 3065.46
of like correct what he's done like no

3062.16 --> 3067.98
he's a [ __ ] idiot who gives a [ __ ] I

3065.46 --> 3069.7200000000003
don't go to Flat derp videos and comment

3067.98 --> 3071.819
on uh you got it wrong you didn't

3069.72 --> 3074.0989999999997
understand me like no

3071.819 --> 3077.66
no I don't

3074.099 --> 3077.6600000000003
because it's [ __ ] pointless

3083.46 --> 3086.96
hey LSG it's you

3100.079 --> 3104.42
the syringe as a container what

3110.339 --> 3116.359
oh just here he did it with a syringe

3112.8 --> 3116.3590000000004
did he Jesus what an idiot

3132.48 --> 3138.0
but if he just so desperate to bypass

3135.66 --> 3140.7
second law of Thermodynamics then just

3138.0 --> 3142.8
do the rumpus thing and say secret love

3140.7 --> 3147.02
thermodynamics doesn't apply to the

3142.8 --> 3147.02
Earth or the globe model right

3147.119 --> 3151.88
and just don't even try this nonsense

3151.92 --> 3156.2400000000002
you just say oh natural law just doesn't

3154.26 --> 3159.1400000000003
apply to the ball Earth

3156.24 --> 3159.14
done

3163.5 --> 3168.24
a little refracted curvature hey I don't

3166.38 --> 3170.96
see you around here a lot

3168.24 --> 3170.9599999999996
how are you doing

3172.74 --> 3178.9399999999996
what is a boycott God

3175.14 --> 3178.94
I have no idea what you're talking about

3199.5 --> 3203.54
no hey Godzilla

3204.72 --> 3208.859
so

3207.059 --> 3212.2200000000003
I'm getting a wrench now not because you

3208.859 --> 3213.96
deserve it because I want people to stop

3212.22 --> 3216.18
Banning you

3213.96 --> 3217.859
I keep having to scrap you off the

3216.18 --> 3220.46
banned list I don't know who the hell

3217.859 --> 3220.46
that was doing

3221.7 --> 3225.14
or who the hell was doing that

3227.099 --> 3230.0
foreign

3248.16 --> 3250.7599999999998
foreign

3254.3 --> 3260.0
oh wait you're already there

3257.46 --> 3260.0
huh

3267.24 --> 3274.319
you're not luckily yeah no no

3270.359 --> 3277.14
but something is weird happening with my

3274.319 --> 3278.46
with my moderator list and all that I

3277.14 --> 3280.7599999999998
don't know what the hell's going on

3278.46 --> 3280.76
there

3285.3 --> 3288.8390000000004
you know what [ __ ] it I'm gonna give you

3286.98 --> 3290.579
a wrench too

3288.839 --> 3292.619
fine

3290.579 --> 3294.599
I can always take them away again if

3292.619 --> 3297.92
people go don't know how to deal with

3294.599 --> 3297.92
don't know how to handle it

3301.859 --> 3305.72
so everybody got a ranch

3316.5 --> 3322.2
to give a big round of applause to the

3319.559 --> 3323.94
only flat earther as consistent as the

3322.2 --> 3326.52
Stars

3323.94 --> 3330.0
are you talking about me

3326.52 --> 3332.28
because I have been extremely consistent

3330.0 --> 3335.64
like even though everybody thought that

3332.28 --> 3338.3390000000004
was crazy I'm still consistent

3335.64 --> 3340.92
I'm still saying that celestials are

3338.339 --> 3344.18
non-local Holograms even though I can't

3340.92 --> 3344.1800000000003
physically prove that

3345.3 --> 3348.7400000000002
but I'm still saying it

3363.8 --> 3368.46
compressing the arrows to demonstrate

3366.059 --> 3372.2400000000002
how much of the air is empty space

3368.46 --> 3375.7200000000003
between them okay moon rover that's cute

3372.24 --> 3377.3999999999996
but that doesn't actually improve

3375.72 --> 3379.3799999999997
the gas pressure without a container

3377.4 --> 3382.02
because it's still like oh yeah you can

3379.38 --> 3384.839
compress something have a little hole

3382.02 --> 3386.7599999999998
and then it's like a deflating Tire yeah

3384.839 --> 3388.0789999999997
there's more pressure in it but it is

3386.76 --> 3390.3590000000004
getting out

3388.079 --> 3392.6400000000003
it's never gonna stop getting out until

3390.359 --> 3394.58
the pressure outside of the syringe is

3392.64 --> 3397.6099999999997
going to be equal to inside you see

3394.58 --> 3397.61
[Music]

3405.68 --> 3410.5989999999997
speaking to my filming what do you mean

3411.96 --> 3417.42
you mean my presentation my setup for

3415.079 --> 3421.319
the show

3417.42 --> 3422.579
yeah maybe it's like well I like it

3421.319 --> 3425.2799999999997
though

3422.579 --> 3427.38
I like I really like the background I

3425.28 --> 3429.5400000000004
it's almost like a second home for me

3427.38 --> 3432.78
now it's like yeah I have this Cabin in

3429.54 --> 3435.619
the Woods it's virtual but I mean I'm

3432.78 --> 3435.619
there all the time

3444.42 --> 3450.14
we are Captain early birds okay at least

3456.66 --> 3462.359
that's funny one I like that

3459.859 --> 3465.42
man all these birds there's a lot of

3462.359 --> 3469.94
bird emoticons

3465.42 --> 3469.94
a dodo bird even there I see

3472.319 --> 3475.339
and that

3494.64 --> 3498.96
yeah and let the super yeah there's no

3496.92 --> 3500.94
super chats in here by the way refracted

3498.96 --> 3504.38
curve here there's only PayPal donations

3500.94 --> 3504.38
and patreon memberships

3506.46 --> 3512.579
because super chats are it's a fun thing

3509.64 --> 3515.04
right but I don't get any of it

3512.579 --> 3517.5
and so that makes it a lot less fun for

3515.04 --> 3520.14
me when I know that I'm like yeah for

3517.5 --> 3522.78
that thing you threw there in a month's

3520.14 --> 3525.7799999999997
time I might get like five cents out of

3522.78 --> 3528.98
that 10 euros or whatever you sent me

3525.78 --> 3532.26
so that made me kind of like turn it off

3528.98 --> 3536.9
I'd rather get just like a hundred

3532.26 --> 3536.9
percent in two days instead

3537.66 --> 3541.5789999999997
hmm

3539.4 --> 3541.579
foreign

3572.339 --> 3577.619
or t-shirts

3575.099 --> 3580.319
uh

3577.619 --> 3582.599
yeah I guess I'm still wearing your

3580.319 --> 3584.819
T-shirt I really like this one

3582.599 --> 3587.099
I like the other one probably even

3584.819 --> 3589.44
better but this one has like the early

3587.099 --> 3592.2000000000003
bird logo so now I can walk around with

3589.44 --> 3593.579
it and basically having Flat Earth on my

3592.2 --> 3596.2799999999997
t-shirt without

3593.579 --> 3599.88
so people can see that

3596.28 --> 3602.46
without it needing to come up in a

3599.88 --> 3604.5
conversation I like that about the shirt

3602.46 --> 3605.359
I like that it's on there but it's not

3604.5 --> 3608.16
like

3605.359 --> 3610.92
as you can see it from like a

3608.16 --> 3613.5
a hundred meters away or something

3610.92 --> 3616.14
but that anybody getting close to me can

3613.5 --> 3617.94
literally look and see like like Flat

3616.14 --> 3620.16
Earth what

3617.94 --> 3622.26
what so they can see it without it

3620.16 --> 3625.16
having to come up in a conversation and

3622.26 --> 3625.1600000000003
I like that about it

3631.74 --> 3635.7599999999998
it makes no different if it's flat or

3634.14 --> 3639.6189999999997
globe

3635.76 --> 3639.619
yeah it kind of does though

3645.42 --> 3650.54
you see the globe is intricately tied in

3648.359 --> 3653.4
without our space

3650.54 --> 3656.64
they're together

3653.4 --> 3659.579
they're part of the same setup

3656.64 --> 3661.98
Flat Earth does not have that setup so

3659.579 --> 3664.1400000000003
it definitely matters

3661.98 --> 3666.66
flatter glow

3664.14 --> 3669.2599999999998
because flat doesn't have a claim of

3666.66 --> 3669.2599999999998
outer space

3669.42 --> 3676.38
if anything flat would have a claim of

3672.42 --> 3676.38
upper space huh

3676.68 --> 3680.48
how about that upper space

3683.46 --> 3688.099
I'm actually gonna put that in the title

3685.5 --> 3688.099
that's smart

3688.92 --> 3695.929
foreign

3691.26 --> 3695.929
[Music]

3706.02 --> 3709.799
okay Godzilla

3714.14 --> 3719.42
did you accidentally get it yeah you did

3720.18 --> 3726.359
but I probably did that by accident

3723.96 --> 3729.319
but you got a normal one so yeah

3726.359 --> 3729.319
everything should be good

3730.92 --> 3734.7200000000003
the second time no no you're not

3737.819 --> 3741.92
I think what the hell

3742.559 --> 3746.48
no longer no no you're a standard

3755.579 --> 3760.02
one is a management management wrench

3757.98 --> 3762.44
can take away and give wrenches that's

3760.02 --> 3762.44
the difference

3764.04 --> 3767.04
foreign

3774.54 --> 3777.5
for some reason

3790.14 --> 3794.8799999999997
there's a lot of space between the

3792.54 --> 3799.16
molecules and how do you know that moon

3794.88 --> 3802.92
rover that's just a model

3799.16 --> 3805.14
space between molecules

3802.92 --> 3807.42
can you prove that

3805.14 --> 3809.7
can you actually prove that or is that

3807.42 --> 3813.059
just a theory

3809.7 --> 3814.6189999999997
like gas well there's molecules those

3813.059 --> 3817.559
molecules we're going to just assume

3814.619 --> 3819.599
that those molecules are exactly like

3817.559 --> 3822.48
solids and liquids they have a specific

3819.599 --> 3825.78
size a minimum size oh really

3822.48 --> 3829.92
so you can prove that gas

3825.78 --> 3833.7000000000003
has a minimum size do you

3829.92 --> 3836.339
no nobody can it's just a model it's

3833.7 --> 3838.98
just oh this is how I'm gonna imagine

3836.339 --> 3841.0789999999997
that gas is it's actually simple

3838.98 --> 3843.14
molecules all just bouncing with a lot

3841.079 --> 3846.059
of space yeah

3843.14 --> 3848.2799999999997
that's conceptual

3846.059 --> 3851.6400000000003
you don't know

3848.28 --> 3853.6800000000003
that it's literally molecules with a lot

3851.64 --> 3856.2599999999998
of space between them bouncing around

3853.68 --> 3857.94
you don't know that it is that that's

3856.26 --> 3862.7400000000002
the model

3857.94 --> 3866.64
and it's a fairy Goa doable goable model

3862.74 --> 3869.22
but that doesn't mean that's literal

3866.64 --> 3872.819
you see there's this issue with with

3869.22 --> 3876.3799999999997
gases most of the gases and that's that

3872.819 --> 3879.66
you can't really see them

3876.38 --> 3882.299
in order to isolate them to a single

3879.66 --> 3885.359
unit and then see how that single unit

3882.299 --> 3888.619
interacts with other single invisible

3885.359 --> 3888.619
units you know

3893.88 --> 3897.0
bouncy balls I'm gonna take your wrench

3895.859 --> 3900.96
homeopath

3897.0 --> 3904.5
no I'm not but that's a terrible

3900.96 --> 3907.14
don't remind us of that nonsense

3904.5 --> 3910.14
was it again

3907.14 --> 3910.14
thunderfoot

3914.88 --> 3920.4
like Adam same thing yeah yeah except

3917.579 --> 3924.559
with atoms you can definitely use

3920.4 --> 3929.099
electron microscopes with solids

3924.559 --> 3931.38
to well get to see the outline

3929.099 --> 3936.1800000000003
of where they are

3931.38 --> 3938.76
and thus what shape they are roughly or

3936.18 --> 3941.2799999999997
it's so it seems right that's what you

3938.76 --> 3944.5200000000004
can definitely do with gases however

3941.28 --> 3946.559
yeah you can't actually do that

3944.52 --> 3948.96
right there's more there's an other

3946.559 --> 3951.6600000000003
model for gas

3948.96 --> 3953.28
that you could use it's not really going

3951.66 --> 3955.5
to make much of a difference but you

3953.28 --> 3960.119
could say that what if the molecule

3955.5 --> 3964.619
itself off the gas is actually flexible

3960.119 --> 3969.2400000000002
yeah what if the molecule is basically

3964.619 --> 3972.5
can become as big as the volume

3969.24 --> 3972.5
that contains it

3974.64 --> 3980.2799999999997
you know how do you know

3978.24 --> 3982.74
it's still invisible it's not gonna

3980.28 --> 3984.8390000000004
become visible if it's

3982.74 --> 3988.0789999999997
inflating

3984.839 --> 3991.799
right it the same issues remain so there

3988.079 --> 3996.98
is other models in which you could

3991.799 --> 3996.98
imagine gas behavior to work as

3998.28 --> 4004.099
yeah we now assume sort of in general in

4002.24 --> 4005.9599999999996
physics class and whatever chemistry

4004.099 --> 4008.599
that's just like oh it's molecules and

4005.96 --> 4011.359
they're bouncing and oh if there's more

4008.599 --> 4013.579
volume available and but not more gas

4011.359 --> 4016.819
well then it's just they will bounce

4013.579 --> 4018.799
even further oh yeah but that's just a

4016.819 --> 4021.74
model it could also be yeah what if

4018.799 --> 4025.52
there's gas molecules don't bounce like

4021.74 --> 4029.4799999999996
that they're actually like just sort of

4025.52 --> 4034.48
sitting there like a fluid or whatever

4029.48 --> 4034.48
freely moving but they like enlarge

4035.0 --> 4040.88
like a balloon maybe gas itself is like

4037.819 --> 4043.4
little balloons that just oh the

4040.88 --> 4045.5
the pressure goes down well then the

4043.4 --> 4048.44
balloon inflates

4045.5 --> 4052.16
what if gas is just like little balloons

4048.44 --> 4054.079
I mean it's a it's just a model it's a

4052.16 --> 4056.1189999999997
model of visualization of what's

4054.079 --> 4057.4
actually happening

4056.119 --> 4060.6800000000003
right

4057.4 --> 4065.14
neither can be definitively proven

4060.68 --> 4065.14
because it can't actually be measured

4073.16 --> 4077.0589999999997
was that why I didn't give you a wrench

4075.2 --> 4079.5789999999997
Godzilla because she'd always go whining

4077.059 --> 4083.079
about the freaking molecule

4079.579 --> 4083.079
uh whatever

4086.96 --> 4092.0
yeah you can do that whatever you want

4089.299 --> 4094.24
don't don't whine about it though in my

4092.0 --> 4094.24
chat

4095.93 --> 4100.46
[Music]

4098.12 --> 4102.14
whining yeah

4100.46 --> 4106.219
yeah whining

4102.14 --> 4108.7390000000005
you have nothing to replace it with

4106.219 --> 4111.4
you don't even have proof that it's

4108.739 --> 4111.4
incorrect

4113.42 --> 4119.839
and you're not going to get any proof

4116.54 --> 4123.219
that it is correct or incorrect so yes

4119.839 --> 4123.219
it is just whining

4128.719 --> 4131.5
you see

4131.6 --> 4137.56
when there's nothing to falsify it's

4134.719 --> 4137.56
just whining

4138.44 --> 4142.58
they're not winning whinings

4145.58 --> 4148.54
winning

4154.54 --> 4158.38
yeah low M appeal

4158.839 --> 4164.98
you were not doing well before

4161.96 --> 4164.9800000000005
did I miss something

4166.4 --> 4170.719
you have nothing to replace the glow oh

4168.44 --> 4173.178999999999
yeah but I freaking do have something to

4170.719 --> 4175.279
replace the globe with Godzilla that's a

4173.179 --> 4177.259
really bad straw man

4175.279 --> 4179.179
you see if you're gonna hold on that

4177.259 --> 4181.16
much that you're gonna make false

4179.179 --> 4182.9
comparisons

4181.16 --> 4184.5199999999995
then there's just something weird going

4182.9 --> 4185.48
on with you

4184.52 --> 4188.839000000001
yeah

4185.48 --> 4191.9
I mean this uh molecules you can't prove

4188.839 --> 4194.299
it yeah that's your upward Rising Earth

4191.9 --> 4197.78
you're being dull right now about it

4194.299 --> 4201.679
yeah you know why because you can never

4197.78 --> 4204.8
prove or disprove it you're being Dell

4201.679 --> 4207.8
about your atoms and molecules Godzilla

4204.8 --> 4210.820000000001
that's a fact

4207.8 --> 4213.8
you're doing the same thing

4210.82 --> 4217.16
emphasizing complaining

4213.8 --> 4220.76
when there is literally nothing you will

4217.16 --> 4223.4
ever be able to do to change it

4220.76 --> 4226.159000000001
the change the perception or knowledge

4223.4 --> 4229.339999999999
thereof you will never be able to do

4226.159 --> 4231.739
anything about it so it's just whining

4229.34 --> 4234.62
yeah yeah it's accurate it's accurate

4231.739 --> 4236.839999999999
whining Godzilla accurate whining about

4234.62 --> 4240.5
something that you will never be able to

4236.84 --> 4245.4400000000005
do anything about nor prove or disprove

4240.5 --> 4245.44
it's just whining and that's a fact

4245.6 --> 4249.02
[Music]

4246.679 --> 4251.06
oh yeah

4249.02 --> 4254.26
yeah I did tell you all for taking the

4251.06 --> 4254.26
test I'm appeal I did

4256.1 --> 4259.06
I remember now

4259.159 --> 4262.54
did you get vitamin C

4264.44 --> 4269.299999999999
you want to hear devil say purple

4266.659 --> 4272.299999999999
burglar alarm

4269.3 --> 4272.3
alarm

4274.76 --> 4282.9400000000005
purple Burger a lot of yeah it's not

4279.92 --> 4282.9400000000005
going to be very fluid

4283.219 --> 4289.46
burglary Scottish people can't say

4286.239 --> 4291.199
yeah I I know what you mean when I try

4289.46 --> 4293.5
to do it in Scottish accents it doesn't

4291.199 --> 4293.5
work

4296.12 --> 4299.199
it's hilarious

4305.9 --> 4310.639999999999
little never dressed it except you did

4308.0 --> 4314.32
you brought it up you brought it up

4310.64 --> 4317.84
again as an initiator you initiated

4314.32 --> 4319.599999999999
bringing it up and then I told you about

4317.84 --> 4321.14
it

4319.6 --> 4324.400000000001
lordzilla

4321.14 --> 4324.400000000001
you brought it up

4325.45 --> 4328.67
[Music]

4332.239 --> 4337.04
I complain about it don't complain about

4334.64 --> 4338.780000000001
I will keep saying this yeah every time

4337.04 --> 4340.64
you bring it up I'm gonna tell you yeah

4338.78 --> 4343.34
it's just like Dell's upward Rising

4340.64 --> 4346.219
Earth you can never prove or disprove it

4343.34 --> 4348.7390000000005
and it will always be like that Godzilla

4346.219 --> 4352.1
and I will every time you bring it up I

4348.739 --> 4354.199
will immediately say that to remind you

4352.1 --> 4357.400000000001
that you're holding on to something that

4354.199 --> 4357.4
is in falsifiable

4358.96 --> 4364.159
just so you stop doing that because it's

4361.94 --> 4366.739
kind of annoying when people hold on to

4364.159 --> 4371.42
things that are completely unfalsifiable

4366.739 --> 4374.0
it kind of turns you into a conspiratory

4371.42 --> 4376.4
I mean it that's really what it does so

4374.0 --> 4379.28
don't do that don't hold on to things

4376.4 --> 4380.199
that you can never ever prove that you

4379.28 --> 4384.38
can

4380.199 --> 4385.879999999999
prove never to be able to prove

4384.38 --> 4387.7390000000005
don't do that

4385.88 --> 4389.6
if you can prove you can never prove

4387.739 --> 4394.659
something then don't hold on to that

4389.6 --> 4394.659000000001
thing it's stupid it's a waste of time

4394.9 --> 4400.28
I don't hold on to when you do yeah

4397.76 --> 4402.1990000000005
that's just classic projection Godzilla

4400.28 --> 4403.699
you're the one that brings it up every

4402.199 --> 4406.46
time

4403.699 --> 4407.599999999999
I even forgot that you bring it up every

4406.46 --> 4411.5
time

4407.6 --> 4414.26
until you brought it up again Godzilla

4411.5 --> 4416.5
stop the projecting [ __ ] just move

4414.26 --> 4416.5
on

4425.12 --> 4430.9
why does agree to disagree reminds you

4427.94 --> 4430.9
of your ex-wife

4431.0 --> 4436.94
because disagreeing to or agreeing to

4434.6 --> 4438.400000000001
disagree is not a durable solution to

4436.94 --> 4441.379999999999
anything

4438.4 --> 4444.82
and that's why it's your ex-wife Dr

4441.38 --> 4444.82
utker could that be it

4458.12 --> 4463.28
okay Godzilla

4461.179 --> 4466.1
I am gonna kick you out if you just

4463.28 --> 4469.36
don't shut the [ __ ] up with your lip

4466.1 --> 4469.360000000001
that you're giving right now

4471.38 --> 4476.78
it's really [ __ ] annoying yeah when I

4475.1 --> 4479.06
tell you off about something that's

4476.78 --> 4483.62
absolutely legitimate

4479.06 --> 4487.46
and everything I said was 100 correct

4483.62 --> 4489.739
then you shouldn't keep whining about it

4487.46 --> 4492.199
yeah

4489.739 --> 4495.44
when you're just wrong you shouldn't

4492.199 --> 4499.0599999999995
continue whining about it

4495.44 --> 4499.0599999999995
that's really bad form

4502.46 --> 4507.62
wrong on what wrong on your attitude

4504.8 --> 4510.9800000000005
wrong on complaining about it wrong on

4507.62 --> 4514.34
your projection of me doing things wrong

4510.98 --> 4517.459999999999
or me bringing it up all that Godzilla

4514.34 --> 4520.52
you're wrong you're projecting you're

4517.46 --> 4524.679
[ __ ] embarrassing doing this stop it

4520.52 --> 4524.679
stop it or I will kick you out

4524.719 --> 4530.719
and this time I'm not gonna like unban

4527.36 --> 4533.0
you again for a while because I don't

4530.719 --> 4537.14
want you to behave like this

4533.0 --> 4540.76
it's very disruptive and it's beneath

4537.14 --> 4540.76
the level of my chat

4541.219 --> 4543.4
foreign

4573.58 --> 4578.78
what the hell why are you gonna call our

4576.4 --> 4582.46
Amma Paul

4578.78 --> 4582.46
pow what the [ __ ]

4610.82 --> 4617.5
just leave him alone moon rover

4614.36 --> 4620.599999999999
is this you're talking about chemistry

4617.5 --> 4623.14
Godzilla has questions about the actual

4620.6 --> 4623.14
form

4623.239 --> 4630.459999999999
his question is about form not about

4626.08 --> 4630.46
ratios not about chemistry

4631.58 --> 4637.28
yeah his problem is is that he thinks

4634.46 --> 4640.42
there's no visual proof of atoms or

4637.28 --> 4640.42
molecules as a unit

4641.239 --> 4645.62
and technically is correct even though

4643.4 --> 4647.78
there are electron microscopes that will

4645.62 --> 4649.9
yield renderings that will definitely

4647.78 --> 4653.179
show you

4649.9 --> 4655.219
where there's not enough maneuvering

4653.179 --> 4657.8
space for the electrons to maneuver

4655.219 --> 4660.7390000000005
because they can't go there because it's

4657.8 --> 4662.54
an atom or molecule but it's still a

4660.739 --> 4665.78
rendering so it's technically correct

4662.54 --> 4668.36
it's just really [ __ ] whiny

4665.78 --> 4671.259999999999
because it doesn't prove anything or

4668.36 --> 4671.259999999999
disprove anything

4671.9 --> 4677.599999999999
it doesn't disprove the way we even

4674.659 --> 4680.0599999999995
think of molecules and atoms when we try

4677.6 --> 4682.9400000000005
to visualize themselves them for

4680.06 --> 4684.860000000001
ourselves and animations or in our minds

4682.94 --> 4686.54
because we do that right like the little

4684.86 --> 4687.98
bouncy ball we see them like balls

4686.54 --> 4690.5
that's how you get them in school and

4687.98 --> 4692.48
chemistry little ball molecules you

4690.5 --> 4693.98
arrange them yeah so that's how you

4692.48 --> 4695.78
think of it

4693.98 --> 4699.379999999999
there's no proof it's literally that

4695.78 --> 4702.739
it's just completely irrelevant and

4699.38 --> 4707.179
totally unfalsifiable because there is

4702.739 --> 4709.94
no way to prove what it exactly is or

4707.179 --> 4713.12
isn't because it's too small and that's

4709.94 --> 4716.599999999999
why electron microscopy is the only

4713.12 --> 4719.199
thing that comes even close to revealing

4716.6 --> 4719.1990000000005
what they're like

4720.8 --> 4727.219
and the rest is just fully

4724.219 --> 4731.26
Folly and whining about things that

4727.219 --> 4731.26
cannot be proven or disproven

4735.5 --> 4741.04
yeah I know Godzilla so stop bringing it

4738.86 --> 4741.04
up

4744.08 --> 4748.82
I know

4745.88 --> 4750.86
what you're talking about I know these

4748.82 --> 4752.719
things Godzilla I understood it I

4750.86 --> 4753.98
understood it from the first moment you

4752.719 --> 4756.02
brought it up

4753.98 --> 4758.178999999999
I also told you there's literally

4756.02 --> 4760.580000000001
nothing you can prove there and you just

4758.179 --> 4762.08
complaining every time about oh it's not

4760.58 --> 4765.32
this it's not that

4762.08 --> 4767.36
is just disruptive it doesn't amount to

4765.32 --> 4771.44
anything it's not going to lead to a

4767.36 --> 4774.32
better understanding or an alternative

4771.44 --> 4776.48
it's just disruptive

4774.32 --> 4779.5599999999995
distracting

4776.48 --> 4779.5599999999995
a waste of time

4780.219 --> 4786.32
I mean sure grow out to Mark a remark

4784.219 --> 4789.08
like yeah we don't actually know what

4786.32 --> 4791.799999999999
atoms and molecules look like

4789.08 --> 4794.719
and leave it to that just just that

4791.8 --> 4797.179
that's kind of a smart remark it's like

4794.719 --> 4798.92
yeah yeah you're technically correct but

4797.179 --> 4801.7390000000005
let's leave it at that because there's

4798.92 --> 4803.06
absolutely nothing we can ever do to

4801.739 --> 4805.94
change that

4803.06 --> 4809.06
so there you go

4805.94 --> 4811.46
that's the thing one sentence not a

4809.06 --> 4813.8
discussion for half an hour straight

4811.46 --> 4815.2390000000005
not something that's worth referencing

4813.8 --> 4817.34
continually

4815.239 --> 4820.759999999999
just one sentence

4817.34 --> 4823.82
that you may say at some point

4820.76 --> 4826.1
every now and then and that's it

4823.82 --> 4829.58
it's not discussion material there's

4826.1 --> 4831.9400000000005
nothing to prove or disprove about it

4829.58 --> 4831.94
foreign

4836.79 --> 4839.85
[Music]

4841.46 --> 4845.7390000000005
oh the A and the E are the same

4851.78 --> 4858.4
ah so Amma pile I'm uphill

4855.739 --> 4858.4
like that

4860.06 --> 4862.659000000001
hmm

4874.04 --> 4878.98
right so yeah I hope you guys are

4875.9 --> 4878.98
enjoying the show today

4879.32 --> 4884.92
I could really use some PayPal donation

4882.02 --> 4884.92
still

4886.0 --> 4890.86
it's been over half a week

4893.96 --> 4897.4
I could really use some

4900.14 --> 4903.14
foreign

4904.06 --> 4908.38
even little bits still help

4944.84 --> 4950.3
taste and smell yeah

4948.02 --> 4952.580000000001
well I'm appeal that's especially

4950.3 --> 4954.62
because of the test right that's like

4952.58 --> 4956.0
testing your notes unless you hit the

4954.62 --> 4958.219
butt test

4956.0 --> 4960.8
but I kind of doubt that but yeah that

4958.219 --> 4964.179
knows [ __ ] test like that literally

4960.8 --> 4964.179
tends to damage

4964.219 --> 4969.62
your smell nerves like in in that moment

4967.58 --> 4970.699
they get disrupted because of the

4969.62 --> 4975.5199999999995
chemical

4970.699 --> 4975.5199999999995
that they deposit when they do that

4988.699 --> 4994.219
right if you're gonna like have cotton

4991.52 --> 4997.820000000001
balls or whatever Q-tips

4994.219 --> 4999.9800000000005
stuck in your nose and [ __ ]

4997.82 --> 5002.259999999999
and you're gonna get a cold yeah well

4999.98 --> 5004.36
then you're probably gonna lose your

5002.26 --> 5006.280000000001
sense of smell

5004.36 --> 5008.759999999999
because you were literally poking around

5006.28 --> 5008.759999999999
in it

5013.42 --> 5019.32
is it not common to lose sense of taste

5015.88 --> 5019.32
and smell during a flu as well

5020.02 --> 5025.4800000000005
a bit if it's very bad if it's like a

5023.62 --> 5028.0599999999995
full-on

5025.48 --> 5030.099999999999
situation

5028.06 --> 5031.780000000001
like that it's so bad that literally

5030.1 --> 5033.820000000001
your skin starts to feel slightly

5031.78 --> 5035.92
different and all like a full-on sick

5033.82 --> 5038.5199999999995
cycle yeah yeah then it is kind of

5035.92 --> 5038.52
normal but

5039.46 --> 5043.84
well not necessarily lose the sense of

5041.98 --> 5047.139999999999
taste and smell but what more typically

5043.84 --> 5050.14
happens is that it's slightly Alters

5047.14 --> 5051.9400000000005
so that while you're in it things taste

5050.14 --> 5054.159000000001
slightly different which is quite a

5051.94 --> 5056.86
nuisance by the way

5054.159 --> 5059.0199999999995
because literally things just taste

5056.86 --> 5063.659
wrong and [ __ ] and smell wrong and is

5059.02 --> 5063.659000000001
very disruptive so that can happen

5069.84 --> 5075.52
real cheese tastes like fresh Lobster ah

5073.659 --> 5078.5199999999995
yuck

5075.52 --> 5080.88
right but yeah and sort of like that

5078.52 --> 5080.88
yeah

5088.48 --> 5095.739
is it possible to develop any symptom

5091.56 --> 5099.4800000000005
imaginable alongside any sick State no

5095.739 --> 5099.48
that's not how that works

5100.84 --> 5107.62
the symptoms directly correlate with the

5104.679 --> 5109.6
metabolic process that is cleaning up

5107.62 --> 5111.94
so it all depends on what requires

5109.6 --> 5114.34
cleaning up as to what type of symptoms

5111.94 --> 5117.159
arrive

5114.34 --> 5119.62
right and you might have like getting a

5117.159 --> 5122.739
flu triggered from being around people

5119.62 --> 5124.78
that were and you were like oh [ __ ] so

5122.739 --> 5126.699
it got to you then you get it even

5124.78 --> 5128.739
though you don't necessarily need it and

5126.699 --> 5131.139999999999
then if you happen to have like other

5128.739 --> 5133.959999999999
issues like oh [ __ ] my kidneys or

5131.14 --> 5135.88
something or like on their pressure for

5133.96 --> 5138.82
a while I've been taking medic yeah then

5135.88 --> 5141.76
those might certainly play up because of

5138.82 --> 5142.599999999999
the psychosomatically activated flu that

5141.76 --> 5146.400000000001
you got

5142.6 --> 5146.400000000001
yeah that can actually happen

5148.12 --> 5153.699
if you already had other weak spots then

5151.0 --> 5156.699
something that isn't necessarily

5153.699 --> 5159.638999999999
a heavy impact can still also then start

5156.699 --> 5163.0
addressing the weak response

5159.639 --> 5165.42
in your body that that does happen

5163.0 --> 5165.42
right

5176.26 --> 5182.5
that test didn't put anything

5178.9 --> 5184.0
used my own Q-tip yeah but you put it in

5182.5 --> 5186.6
your nose right

5184.0 --> 5186.6
okay

5189.46 --> 5194.08
so you

5191.26 --> 5197.4400000000005
you didn't get like a Q-tip with

5194.08 --> 5199.9
chemical [ __ ] on it then Emma fuel

5197.44 --> 5202.239
if you use your own Q-tip I take it that

5199.9 --> 5204.5199999999995
you don't dip your own Q-tips in

5202.239 --> 5208.62
chemical crap

5204.52 --> 5208.620000000001
for disinfectant [ __ ] or whatever

5212.199 --> 5216.96
don't

5213.76 --> 5216.96
don't do that Terry

5224.26 --> 5227.26
hello

5233.199 --> 5240.239
that's not part of the key okay fine

5236.32 --> 5240.239
well then you didn't get chemicals

5240.76 --> 5247.02
a forced to do it yeah well you can

5242.98 --> 5247.0199999999995
describe that differently tear it

5264.34 --> 5269.46
weird by the way I didn't know they even

5266.26 --> 5269.46
had anything like that

5273.179 --> 5276.84
okay good on you

5277.48 --> 5283.739
then at least you didn't get any

5279.219 --> 5283.7390000000005
chemical crap from that I take it

5291.28 --> 5295.42
white shoot

5293.199 --> 5298.259999999999
this is a soccer card for brandeiser

5295.42 --> 5298.26
okay

5311.139 --> 5315.400000000001
there's a lot of ways to get the

5312.82 --> 5317.699
chemical crab yes

5315.4 --> 5321.5199999999995
it's just that I've been made aware

5317.699 --> 5323.98
specifically about that so when it's

5321.52 --> 5326.139
been like a literal item that they did

5323.98 --> 5327.759999999999
even here in the Netherlands I'm gonna

5326.139 --> 5330.639
warn about it

5327.76 --> 5332.38
I'm gonna warn about that because that

5330.639 --> 5335.5
literally happened like

5332.38 --> 5337.42
they made like my stepmother do that and

5335.5 --> 5340.12
I was really worried about her for that

5337.42 --> 5342.219
I told her like don't that's chemical

5340.12 --> 5344.94
[ __ ] you don't want that try to avoid

5342.219 --> 5344.94
that if you can

5345.04 --> 5350.08
because those chemicals that they put on

5347.38 --> 5351.76
that was really bad like that's toxic

5350.08 --> 5354.1
[ __ ]

5351.76 --> 5357.54
that's not harmless

5354.1 --> 5357.54
like Elko or whatever

5361.659 --> 5366.159
so I'm always like

5363.94 --> 5368.138999999999
looking out for that sort of thing but

5366.159 --> 5369.5199999999995
if you say that you use your own Q-tip

5368.139 --> 5371.56
okay well then

5369.52 --> 5373.9800000000005
well at least you didn't get that crap

5371.56 --> 5373.9800000000005
in yet

5380.199 --> 5388.62
again yeah sure tear it but I mean

5384.699 --> 5388.62
that stuff is like

5389.02 --> 5392.52
it's touch based

5392.739 --> 5399.94
they can't like spray that over here

5397.239 --> 5401.919999999999
true airplanes or whatever

5399.94 --> 5406.799999999999
they're not definitely not gonna put

5401.92 --> 5406.8
that in like any vaccines either so

5407.32 --> 5412.08
they have plenty of other terrible

5409.06 --> 5412.080000000001
things they put in there

5419.92 --> 5425.62
but you put the Q-tip into yeah yeah no

5423.159 --> 5430.0
that's not what I talk about yeah

5425.62 --> 5432.04
now that that afterwards stuff that's

5430.0 --> 5433.3
that's just part of the nonsense

5432.04 --> 5435.5199999999995
processing

5433.3 --> 5437.26
it's like oh to proof there's a virus

5435.52 --> 5439.659000000001
you have to put this Capricorn that

5437.26 --> 5441.1
chemical and then oh look at it dissolve

5439.659 --> 5443.199
and become different and I don't know if

5441.1 --> 5446.92
you put this and that and then oh now

5443.199 --> 5449.259999999999
here is the virus like it the entire

5446.92 --> 5451.719
[ __ ] procedure is [ __ ] it's

5449.26 --> 5454.3
totally nonsensical

5451.719 --> 5457.06
so just be assured that that entire

5454.3 --> 5461.639
procedure the test

5457.06 --> 5461.639
is entirely nonsensical

5462.58 --> 5468.5199999999995
just for the record again you can't

5465.34 --> 5472.38
actually test on viruses

5468.52 --> 5472.38
because they don't exist

5472.48 --> 5479.218999999999
they're not actually a cohesive thing

5476.38 --> 5482.32
and it's definitely not a

5479.219 --> 5483.88
self-sufficient type of unit that

5482.32 --> 5486.82
migrates

5483.88 --> 5491.639
to other living beings to procreate

5486.82 --> 5491.639
itself yeah that doesn't exist

5498.76 --> 5504.159000000001
and it's widely known by now that all

5501.76 --> 5508.179
that all these tests for supposed

5504.159 --> 5509.98
viruses are all just a bunch of crazy

5508.179 --> 5514.3
chemical

5509.98 --> 5517.599999999999
chemical waste nonsense magician tricks

5514.3 --> 5521.5
viruses don't actually exist any tests

5517.6 --> 5525.04
to prove viruses are thereby bunk

5521.5 --> 5527.5
because viruses don't actually exist now

5525.04 --> 5529.719
you could have tests that would like

5527.5 --> 5533.88
figure out your condition

5529.719 --> 5537.639
like oh you have a lot of like

5533.88 --> 5539.1
viral like virus Associated activity in

5537.639 --> 5541.659000000001
your body like

5539.1 --> 5543.400000000001
excess elves this is very active because

5541.659 --> 5545.92
you had a recent infection or something

5543.4 --> 5547.42
right yeah you can test on that

5545.92 --> 5550.54
sure

5547.42 --> 5552.9400000000005
you can't actually test on viruses like

5550.54 --> 5555.659
an infectious agent because those don't

5552.94 --> 5555.659
exist

5558.58 --> 5564.0
let me get to Monkey pox no nobody did

5564.1 --> 5569.02
I don't think it even exists

5566.38 --> 5571.54
it's just a stupid fictional [ __ ]

5569.02 --> 5573.580000000001
story to scare people with more

5571.54 --> 5575.56
because they were already scared and

5573.58 --> 5577.42
wearing masks and having lockdown so

5575.56 --> 5579.52
they thought like oh well let's just

5577.42 --> 5581.26
pile it on some more let's see if it

5579.52 --> 5583.6
could actually get some of these people

5581.26 --> 5586.54
that are falling for this [ __ ] to

5583.6 --> 5588.639
get heart attacks out of fear maybe we

5586.54 --> 5591.04
could hasten the death some more with

5588.639 --> 5592.150000000001
some nonsense stories

5591.04 --> 5595.3
foreign

5592.15 --> 5595.299999999999
[Music]

5601.139 --> 5606.9400000000005
but yeah monkeypox yeah that nobody did

5605.139 --> 5609.28
probably people probably just completely

5606.94 --> 5611.739
forgot that even existed I forgot that

5609.28 --> 5613.78
existed until you brought it up

5611.739 --> 5615.82
broadcaster

5613.78 --> 5618.179
but yeah there was supposedly that thing

5615.82 --> 5618.179
right

5618.46 --> 5623.199
I don't think that story lasted longer

5620.739 --> 5625.98
than two weeks and then nobody ever

5623.199 --> 5625.98
heard of it again

5628.54 --> 5631.98
is that a virus no

5637.42 --> 5643.2390000000005
it's something it's not a virus because

5639.88 --> 5645.6990000000005
viruses are not real things

5643.239 --> 5647.739
there's no proof of a virus there's

5645.699 --> 5649.96
proof of bacteria

5647.739 --> 5652.599999999999
it's very little proof that bacteria are

5649.96 --> 5654.78
conclusively causing diseases though

5652.6 --> 5657.58
because cost postulates never applied

5654.78 --> 5660.099999999999
but yeah there's definitely associations

5657.58 --> 5661.84
with bacteria certain toxins that they

5660.1 --> 5664.0
tend to excrete and the symptoms that

5661.84 --> 5666.28
those toxins can cause

5664.0 --> 5668.679
but not that they actually the

5666.28 --> 5670.78
introduction of said bacteria suddenly

5668.679 --> 5673.06
causes the disease there's no proof of

5670.78 --> 5675.219
that because God's postulate is never

5673.06 --> 5679.1990000000005
applied

5675.219 --> 5679.199
it's just a loose correlation

5682.06 --> 5686.139
yeah that's right slow moment buggy

5683.86 --> 5688.12
virology is micro nonsense outer space

5686.139 --> 5691.56
is macronounces that's a great

5688.12 --> 5691.5599999999995
comparison indeed

5693.34 --> 5700.1990000000005
watch white cells attack germs is so

5696.1 --> 5700.1990000000005
cool yeah that's just called cleaning up

5701.44 --> 5705.879999999999
it's like

5703.48 --> 5708.299999999999
they're not supposed to be there in

5705.88 --> 5708.3
function

5711.1 --> 5717.159000000001
right like germs bacteria that are not

5714.58 --> 5721.239
supposed to be there they like yeah they

5717.159 --> 5724.9
do like or create move around eat things

5721.239 --> 5726.218999999999
eat junk Leaf junk all the junk right

5724.9 --> 5727.839999999999
and when they're like in your

5726.219 --> 5729.82
bloodstream and they're definitely not

5727.84 --> 5733.4800000000005
supposed to be in that more vulnerable

5729.82 --> 5736.42
area because it's spread so widely

5733.48 --> 5737.98
well then yeah if the bacteria gets in

5736.42 --> 5740.76
there it's not supposed to be there it's

5737.98 --> 5740.759999999999
going to be eaten

5741.34 --> 5748.0
right but your body is full of bacteria

5744.6 --> 5751.96
like completely riddled with it if you

5748.0 --> 5754.36
literally had all the bacteria somehow

5751.96 --> 5756.4
like teleported out of your body you

5754.36 --> 5758.739
would literally lose half your freaking

5756.4 --> 5761.98
body mass or something I'm not even

5758.739 --> 5763.239
joking you're completely stuffed with

5761.98 --> 5765.099999999999
bacteria

5763.239 --> 5768.5199999999995
everybody is

5765.1 --> 5771.58
they're all over you your blood is

5768.52 --> 5774.659000000001
arguably bacteria that are transformed

5771.58 --> 5774.659
into blood platelets

5774.76 --> 5779.38
there's actual proof of that that

5777.159 --> 5782.159
happens

5779.38 --> 5782.159000000001
so

5782.8 --> 5786.400000000001
yeah there's gonna be some duking out

5784.719 --> 5789.699
some bacteria don't really like other

5786.4 --> 5791.32
bacteria some bacteria like are the body

5789.699 --> 5793.0599999999995
is instructed like yeah they shouldn't

5791.32 --> 5795.099999999999
be there they're disruptive in that area

5793.06 --> 5797.860000000001
so white blood cells take care of them

5795.1 --> 5799.900000000001
right there not in the other places but

5797.86 --> 5802.12
right there definitely

5799.9 --> 5803.92
there'll be some in there continually

5802.12 --> 5805.9
because that's the place where those

5803.92 --> 5806.8
bacteria really shouldn't be hanging

5805.9 --> 5809.799999999999
around

5806.8 --> 5811.12
right of other places yeah that's where

5809.8 --> 5812.62
they are supposed to be hanging around

5811.12 --> 5816.04
and the white blood cells will be just

5812.62 --> 5818.38
like yeah we'll just stay over here make

5816.04 --> 5820.38
sure they don't come over here

5818.38 --> 5822.52
foreign

5820.38 --> 5824.62
because they're not supposed to be here

5822.52 --> 5827.139
they're supposed to be over there

5824.62 --> 5830.639
and that's how I think it really works

5827.139 --> 5830.639
with bacteria in your body

5831.219 --> 5836.26
right the blight blood cells are like

5833.98 --> 5838.718999999999
are like Indian police they're just like

5836.26 --> 5840.900000000001
stick with sticks like get back in your

5838.719 --> 5840.9
house

5841.0 --> 5848.02
like oh get back in the house until

5844.6 --> 5850.179
police is gone right that's white blood

5848.02 --> 5851.860000000001
cells like they're not like ah we're

5850.179 --> 5853.54
gonna kill you all they're just like get

5851.86 --> 5855.58
back in your house

5853.54 --> 5858.88
you're not allowed out a secure curfew

5855.58 --> 5861.36
get out get it get in the inside now

5858.88 --> 5861.36
right

5879.04 --> 5885.1
chicken pox and shingles all right well

5882.58 --> 5887.5
I have like is that called chickenpox

5885.1 --> 5889.84
I'm not sure it's like the child disease

5887.5 --> 5892.96
thing or is that shingles

5889.84 --> 5895.6
I did have that and was really annoying

5892.96 --> 5898.2390000000005
like really disruptive because like I

5895.6 --> 5899.9800000000005
had it on vacation and I wasn't allowed

5898.239 --> 5902.339999999999
to go in the swimming pool which like

5899.98 --> 5905.138999999999
really sucked

5902.34 --> 5906.88
to me because I really wanted in the

5905.139 --> 5909.54
swimming pool

5906.88 --> 5909.54
uh

5910.179 --> 5914.9800000000005
but I mean

5911.92 --> 5917.62
I am not entirely sure what that is

5914.98 --> 5920.879999999999
I just know it's not a virus

5917.62 --> 5920.88
it's more likely

5920.92 --> 5926.679
well

5923.08 --> 5930.58
you know what I I'm just gonna

5926.679 --> 5934.179
sort get to I'm just gonna stick to I

5930.58 --> 5937.0
really really don't know with a lot of

5934.179 --> 5940.6
these things like I really really don't

5937.0 --> 5943.54
know like what the [ __ ] herpes is

5940.6 --> 5944.8
I really don't know what that is there's

5943.54 --> 5947.86
something there

5944.8 --> 5949.659000000001
it's not a virus because viruses don't

5947.86 --> 5953.759999999999
exist

5949.659 --> 5958.599999999999
they cannot be proven to exist

5953.76 --> 5961.2390000000005
in any case ever

5958.6 --> 5963.9400000000005
something there something is happening

5961.239 --> 5966.759999999999
so what the [ __ ] is happening I don't

5963.94 --> 5969.638999999999
know but I do definitely know it's not a

5966.76 --> 5971.26
virus because viruses don't exist

5969.639 --> 5974.1990000000005
their fiction

5971.26 --> 5977.320000000001
the model that surrounds the idea of a

5974.199 --> 5981.4
virus is complete science fiction

5977.32 --> 5983.679
but arguably certain diseases can be

5981.4 --> 5985.719
transferred through like saliva and

5983.679 --> 5988.12
touching and

5985.719 --> 5989.139
things even psychosomatically at a

5988.12 --> 5990.4
distance

5989.139 --> 5993.78
right

5990.4 --> 5993.78
but why

5994.54 --> 5997.78
why

5995.62 --> 5999.4
it's a big question isn't it I don't

5997.78 --> 6001.679
have the answer

5999.4 --> 6003.719
I just know that viruses don't exist

6001.679 --> 6005.159
because postulates never apply to

6003.719 --> 6007.199
bacteria

6005.159 --> 6009.599999999999
or viruses because they don't exist so

6007.199 --> 6012.659
you can't apply anything to them

6009.6 --> 6015.679
but yeah certain diseases do seem to

6012.659 --> 6015.679
like transfer

6019.98 --> 6024.32
antiviral medicine is fake yes

6026.699 --> 6032.299999999999
absolutely

6029.28 --> 6032.3
and a fraud

6041.3 --> 6048.38
influenza regenerative process of the

6044.28 --> 6048.38
body nothing more loving yes indeed

6051.3 --> 6056.639
there's no virus involved it can be

6054.0 --> 6060.84
transferred psychosomatically with

6056.639 --> 6064.92
literally a glass wall in between yeah a

6060.84 --> 6069.3
person can be completely isolated

6064.92 --> 6072.2390000000005
from actual diseased persons that flu

6069.3 --> 6075.84
if they see them being sick being unwell

6072.239 --> 6077.638999999999
being snotty sneezing coughing and you

6075.84 --> 6079.7390000000005
just let that soak in

6077.639 --> 6080.82
even though you're behind a giant glass

6079.739 --> 6083.58
wall

6080.82 --> 6085.5
then guess what's gonna happen there's

6083.58 --> 6087.78
actually a big chance that the person

6085.5 --> 6092.159
will get it

6087.78 --> 6094.4
especially if they don't think they're

6092.159 --> 6094.4
safe

6095.159 --> 6097.679
because if they think like yeah there's

6096.54 --> 6099.719
a glass wall in between there's

6097.679 --> 6102.36
literally no way in hell I could ever

6099.719 --> 6103.92
get it through transference well then

6102.36 --> 6106.32
the chance that he's actually gonna get

6103.92 --> 6108.78
it psychosomatically is very little but

6106.32 --> 6111.36
if he doesn't know that or he's like a

6108.78 --> 6113.159
germaphobe then they can be in class

6111.36 --> 6115.799999999999
four in between and the person could

6113.159 --> 6118.138999999999
still get it because he's just so afraid

6115.8 --> 6120.619000000001
of it

6118.139 --> 6124.88
there's nothing

6120.619 --> 6124.88
preventing the psychosomatic switch

6128.34 --> 6131.1
be interested in seeing that experiment

6130.199 --> 6133.379999999999
yeah

6131.1 --> 6137.46
well there is elaborate studies on

6133.38 --> 6139.5
psychosomatic influence and disease

6137.46 --> 6142.619
transfer and all that so there are

6139.5 --> 6144.84
plenty of studies I mean psychosomatics

6142.619 --> 6147.719
is like officially recognized that

6144.84 --> 6149.84
that's a thing it's just not really put

6147.719 --> 6152.76
on the proper

6149.84 --> 6155.9400000000005
pedestal that it deserves to be because

6152.76 --> 6157.8
it's like the primary cause pretty much

6155.94 --> 6159.299999999999
most of the time

6157.8 --> 6162.2390000000005
yeah

6159.3 --> 6164.46
when does the physique break out when

6162.239 --> 6166.379999999999
it's known that it's broken out that's

6164.46 --> 6169.32
when a disease usually really starts to

6166.38 --> 6171.36
break out when it's completely unknown a

6169.32 --> 6175.679
couple of people can be sick it won't

6171.36 --> 6177.179
break out why because it's not known to

6175.679 --> 6179.46
have broken out

6177.179 --> 6181.9800000000005
when people know it's breaking out oh

6179.46 --> 6184.08
guess what oh we got it too on the other

6181.98 --> 6188.099999999999
side of the country yeah we never went

6184.08 --> 6191.6
there why well because we were told that

6188.1 --> 6195.08
it was out and then we got it yeah yeah

6191.6 --> 6195.08
psychosomatic transfer

6195.179 --> 6200.119
right but I am going to round out the

6197.76 --> 6200.119000000001
show now

6203.4 --> 6208.94
turn out to be pretty interesting kind

6205.38 --> 6208.9400000000005
