208.48 --> 211.67999999999998
late h

234.12 --> 238.0
hey hello Shadow

238.68 --> 241.68
band

242.959 --> 250.31900000000002
huh welcome to the early bird

246.04 --> 254.72
show may I ask how you found this

250.319 --> 257.32
show how you found me since you are a

254.72 --> 259.28
newcomer with an actual channel so not a

257.32 --> 262.21999999999997
troll that just got

259.28 --> 263.4
spawned

262.22 --> 267.16
[Music]

263.4 --> 270.28
uh three days of being sick

267.16 --> 272.759
o all right

270.28 --> 276.11999999999995
are you stocked up on vitamin C Richard

272.759 --> 276.12
G that's you're going to need

277.88 --> 283.639
it especially if it's migrating and and

280.96 --> 287.08
all that my screen name used to be flat

283.639 --> 287.08
Accord me oh

288.0 --> 292.919
[Music]

289.919 --> 292.919
huh

294.6 --> 300.84000000000003
okay why did you change your

297.16 --> 303.199
name but yeah I remember you

300.84 --> 305.44
always like the Channel all right thanks

303.199 --> 308.6
now I remember who you are I just kind

305.44 --> 311.36
of unexpected name change it's always

308.6 --> 311.36
weird when that

311.98 --> 322.52000000000004
[Music]

320.28 --> 326.08
happens and what do you like about my

322.52 --> 326.08
channel I should ask that

327.639 --> 332.319
more always get surprised when people

330.199 --> 334.28000000000003
tell me they like my rants a lot because

332.319 --> 335.759
I always feel like oh oh I'm going out

334.28 --> 339.919
of control

335.759 --> 339.91900000000004
again but then it I don't

341.12 --> 347.08
know what to store a label by this name

344.6 --> 347.08000000000004
oh

347.8 --> 350.8
okay

350.96 --> 355.919
H right well yeah then it makes sense

353.56 --> 357.16
that you actually changed that name okay

355.919 --> 360.75899999999996
fair

357.16 --> 363.16
enough like that my free thing Anor yeah

360.759 --> 367.319
I like that

363.16 --> 370.88000000000005
too although it gets very

367.319 --> 370.88
messy it really

372.96 --> 376.029
[Music]

378.319 --> 383.88
does but I think that I've certainly

380.56 --> 383.88
proven that I'm quite

384.599 --> 390.88
free as I indulge like frequently in

388.479 --> 394.599
directions that I know like it's going

390.88 --> 398.8
to probably a nerve or rub certain types

394.599 --> 398.8
of people the wrong way and I still do

402.12 --> 408.479
it cuz I need to manifest what I'm

405.08 --> 410.75899999999996
thinking otherwise I'm going to get

408.479 --> 413.75899999999996
really

410.759 --> 413.759
just

417.44 --> 422.4
confused like at the the earlier parts

420.16 --> 424.03900000000004
of my channel like before the early

422.4 --> 427.44
ritual there were just some things that

424.039 --> 427.44
I was really trying to hold

427.479 --> 433.4
back wasn't even fully aware of like my

431.639 --> 435.0
positions in certain things because I

433.4 --> 437.52
was just trying to hold back because I'm

435.0 --> 437.52
used to

437.879 --> 445.759
that one of those things being

442.12 --> 451.319
homophobia like that was really that's a

445.759 --> 454.84000000000003
heavyweight thing with me because

451.319 --> 457.16
I I've grown up here in a country with

454.84 --> 459.87899999999996
people everywhere where homophobia is

457.16 --> 462.24
like seen like you're a deranged person

459.879 --> 462.24
or a

465.039 --> 469.919
criminal just by thinking like that and

472.52 --> 481.28
so I had to like I was even encouraged

475.96 --> 483.87899999999996
to just like hide it

481.28 --> 487.75899999999996
yeah that's the ironic thing about the

483.879 --> 490.36
entire situation is that if you have

487.759 --> 493.36
homophobia people encourage you to hide

490.36 --> 495.12
it like as if you were gay like in a

493.36 --> 496.84000000000003
society where that's not accepted you

495.12 --> 499.68
have to hide it no no no here you have

496.84 --> 500.87899999999996
to hide your homophobia yeah welcome to

499.68 --> 503.879
the

500.879 --> 506.96000000000004
Netherlands yeah well I ain't hiding my

503.879 --> 506.96000000000004
homophobia no

507.68 --> 513.159
more I'm coming out of the closet of

510.72 --> 513.159
being

517.399 --> 522.8
homophobic

519.919 --> 525.64
yeah gay behavior and all that it makes

522.8 --> 529.0799999999999
me sick and not all as of some sort of

525.64 --> 531.399
political statement or as a pressure to

529.08 --> 534.9200000000001
to get something done or move people in

531.399 --> 538.04
a certain dire no it literally

534.92 --> 541.36
physically makes me

538.04 --> 543.8389999999999
ill yeah this is not some political tool

541.36 --> 547.32
I'm suddenly Wheeling like a right

543.839 --> 550.9590000000001
winger no I'm literally homophobic it's

547.32 --> 553.32
a physical response it's psychological

550.959 --> 555.5189999999999
condition that I can't get rid of that I

553.32 --> 558.0
had to struggle with all my

555.519 --> 559.64
life and I thought at first like it's

558.0 --> 561.44
not going to really be a problem I hung

559.64 --> 564.1999999999999
around gay people and would just kind of

561.44 --> 566.2
ignore it but like when they would and

564.2 --> 568.519
they did a lot of the times when they

566.2 --> 572.0
would then oh I'm just going to make a

568.519 --> 573.72
move on in here then I would literally I

572.0 --> 576.36
get

573.72 --> 579.72
posttraumatic like [ __ ] from that

576.36 --> 582.04
directly because it was so like it's

579.72 --> 584.279
like you're holding yeah it's like

582.04 --> 587.3199999999999
feeling like you're being

584.279 --> 589.8389999999999
raped and you can't even express it that

587.32 --> 593.5600000000001
you feel

589.839 --> 595.7600000000001
that and it all made it all worse having

593.56 --> 597.88
to go through all that like that's part

595.76 --> 601.12
of the reason why I get so explosive

597.88 --> 601.12
about it now

602.2 --> 609.76
that's real it's not a

605.56 --> 609.76
joke oh and there is no

614.56 --> 621.68
cure rational yeah tactical soap friend

618.2 --> 621.6800000000001
hello you're

624.0 --> 631.12
right you're yeah that's cute that's

628.44 --> 633.6
very cute but I am still like in the

631.12 --> 637.2
middle of

633.6 --> 639.399
it and by the way to a certain degree it

637.2 --> 644.6
is an irrational fear because it's not

639.399 --> 647.12
about again like them gays although I

644.6 --> 648.9590000000001
have a lot

647.12 --> 651.839
of

648.959 --> 654.04
worries for my country because of all

651.839 --> 657.839
this gay influence because I know it's

654.04 --> 660.04
bad it's going to like damage a lot it

657.839 --> 662.24
is already it has already there look

660.04 --> 665.36
they're already like rolling trans kit

662.24 --> 668.639
[ __ ] out here and all that it's it it's

665.36 --> 668.639
already gone really

670.399 --> 676.8
bad but then pretending like it's all

672.959 --> 676.8
normal is not going to make it go

678.2 --> 684.9200000000001
away but the problem is it's it's not

681.0 --> 687.72
just that it's not just like oh I I am

684.92 --> 690.959
again a political position against them

687.72 --> 690.9590000000001
and in

691.72 --> 697.2
yeah let's just say I'm technically

695.0 --> 699.24
politically I'm neutral about it and

697.2 --> 701.44
that is that if somebody if there would

699.24 --> 705.0790000000001
be like a push like to put it back in

701.44 --> 707.0790000000001
the closet I would like not be against

705.079 --> 709.4399999999999
that at all but I wouldn't be on the

707.079 --> 712.8
front lines like yeah g back in the

709.44 --> 717.12
closet yeah I wouldn't be that

712.8 --> 721.4799999999999
guy okay but I would not stop that

717.12 --> 723.76
either because for me the homophobia is

721.48 --> 725.8000000000001
not just this political position that

723.76 --> 728.68
I'm so passionate

725.8 --> 731.279
about because I'm not really it's

728.68 --> 732.68
literally a physical condition it's a

731.279 --> 736.399
physical

732.68 --> 739.199
response like a shock it is a phobia in

736.399 --> 743.0
that sense not because oh I am like

739.199 --> 745.279
always afraid about it it's

743.0 --> 747.48
just right I mean if you're

745.279 --> 749.4399999999999
arachnophobic you're you're you have a

747.48 --> 751.12
phobia of spiders you're not always

749.44 --> 753.399
thinking about oh no is there a spider

751.12 --> 755.44
around the corner no no no but when you

753.399 --> 757.6
suddenly bump into what you start it

755.44 --> 758.8000000000001
startles the [ __ ] out of you and you get

757.6 --> 762.88
like real

758.8 --> 766.959
shock you could compare it more to

762.88 --> 769.959
that right so if I'm going to like be

766.959 --> 772.279
dealing with somebody new it's like very

769.959 --> 775.56
important for me to find out very

772.279 --> 775.56
quickly if they're gay or

777.839 --> 781.519
not

779.399 --> 784.079
because if they are then I I have to

781.519 --> 785.0
like up a shield and like really keep it

784.079 --> 787.88
there

785.0 --> 791.12
permanently because if I just like

787.88 --> 793.76
assume they're like not and I open

791.12 --> 795.72
myself up to them they're going to fall

793.76 --> 798.6
in love they're going to make a move

795.72 --> 798.6
then it happens

805.639 --> 810.76
again

807.76 --> 810.76
right

811.639 --> 816.32
it's because of the great over

813.32 --> 816.32
considered extreme

817.76 --> 822.4399999999999
yes but the weird thing is Shadow band

820.32 --> 825.0
my position isn't even that extreme

822.44 --> 826.7600000000001
politically cuz I'm not like oh get them

825.0 --> 830.0
all

826.76 --> 834.56
out it's just I just want it to be

830.0 --> 834.56
stopped being promoted and forced on

835.16 --> 841.48
people I'm kind of like a '90s

837.759 --> 846.12
oldfashioned liberal that way I am

841.48 --> 848.8000000000001
like dude just if it makes you happy man

846.12 --> 850.9590000000001
temporarily like be informed about the

848.8 --> 852.3599999999999
long-term situation that you're getting

850.959 --> 855.88
yourself

852.36 --> 857.9590000000001
into just don't I just don't want to

855.88 --> 860.279
know about it I don't want to know about

857.959 --> 864.04
your gay porn [ __ ] I don't want to know

860.279 --> 869.16
about your prancing around

864.04 --> 870.16
and just please please Don't Force It in

869.16 --> 873.3199999999999
my

870.16 --> 876.4399999999999
attention that is

873.32 --> 879.12
all there will always be gay people

876.44 --> 880.8800000000001
always if you crack down on them all

879.12 --> 882.6
there will still be gay people guess

880.88 --> 886.0
what they go back in the closet and now

882.6 --> 886.0
they having a giant victim

886.839 --> 890.32
narrative now they're

894.16 --> 899.959
persecuted which is going to like make

896.36 --> 902.24
future Generations risk getting inspired

899.959 --> 906.1199999999999
by all the persecution of gays and make

902.24 --> 906.12
it start over again I don't want

907.52 --> 913.739
[Music]

916.0 --> 922.8
that I just don't want to live a life

919.92 --> 925.8389999999999
where I have to continually risk

922.8 --> 927.92
whenever I deal with men that they might

925.839 --> 930.6
be gay and might make a move at me

927.92 --> 930.5999999999999
that's really it

930.72 --> 937.8000000000001
if that can be perfectly avoided then I

934.0 --> 940.6
am like so much more relieved and just I

937.8 --> 940.5999999999999
will have more

944.72 --> 952.3190000000001
energy anyway hello dank good to see you

948.48 --> 952.3190000000001
akumu virus Dr

957.6 --> 960.6
utar

968.16 --> 974.88
all right anyway so

972.0 --> 976.959
yeah that's one of those things of mine

974.88 --> 976.959
I

979.72 --> 984.36
mean it's a thing with

987.519 --> 995.24
me I'm really open about it for my own

992.399 --> 997.44
protection not because I want to like oh

995.24 --> 1000.839
rile up a whole bunch of people like oh

997.44 --> 1004.1600000000001
look at that homophobic person I don't

1000.839 --> 1008.5600000000001
like I don't even want their attention

1004.16 --> 1011.079
really I have to just say it so that if

1008.56 --> 1013.7589999999999
gays happen to be interested or whatever

1011.079 --> 1016.199
in what I'm talking about that at least

1013.759 --> 1020.839
they're like very well aware that it's

1016.199 --> 1023.7589999999999
not okay here to to like oh oh yeah I'm

1020.839 --> 1027.079
gay like that that's not okay like I'm

1023.759 --> 1030.0
okay if you're gay just don't make sure

1027.079 --> 1030.0
that I don't find

1031.31 --> 1034.349
[Music]

1037.12 --> 1041.9189999999999
out like there might be some gays even

1040.839 --> 1045.079
among

1041.919 --> 1047.5590000000002
you you might yeah it's so it's all

1045.079 --> 1050.32
great right because I totally have no

1047.559 --> 1052.6399999999999
hint of it

1050.32 --> 1056.559
and that's great because then you can

1052.64 --> 1059.8400000000001
still like live the way you want to live

1056.559 --> 1061.84
and follow me without me getting like

1059.84 --> 1065.24
[ __ ] up over

1061.84 --> 1068.36
it over how you live your life and

1065.24 --> 1068.36
that's a good deal I

1070.19 --> 1073.3690000000001
[Music]

1077.4 --> 1081.2800000000002
think

1079.4 --> 1085.5590000000002
hellow low

1081.28 --> 1085.559
fruit having a great day I hope

1099.64 --> 1105.2990000000002
so are you ganked

1102.25 --> 1105.299
[Music]

1106.32 --> 1111.559
musician is there a dank musician

1120.679 --> 1125.48
H right anyway uh yeah that was one

1125.6 --> 1132.36
thing what

1128.039 --> 1135.559
else yeah another item of mine is that I

1132.36 --> 1137.32
do get like kind of savage when I get

1135.559 --> 1139.0
really

1137.32 --> 1141.76
angry

1139.0 --> 1143.4
I I would have used to say I back in the

1141.76 --> 1145.52
past I would have said like I'm going

1143.4 --> 1148.48
full Hitler on you or something but it

1145.52 --> 1151.679
isn't really I'd like them now more

1148.48 --> 1152.799
associated with going full p on on them

1151.679 --> 1155.5590000000002
or

1152.799 --> 1159.28
something I think that's much closer to

1155.559 --> 1159.28
what that spirit resonates

1161.0 --> 1168.919
with cuz inside I have this very angry

1165.919 --> 1170.44
spirit that that's a alongside

1168.919 --> 1173.76
everything

1170.44 --> 1179.3600000000001
else that's just so done like I just

1173.76 --> 1179.36
want order like rough order very

1179.99 --> 1185.72
[Music]

1181.44 --> 1185.72
quickly which is well

1188.64 --> 1195.919
tyrannical but I mean if

1192.44 --> 1197.679
yeah it's basically I feel sometimes

1195.919 --> 1198.7990000000002
that in in a certain sense it's a

1197.679 --> 1201.52
pragmatic

1198.799 --> 1202.52
response even though it seems extremely

1201.52 --> 1206.559
unpragmatic

1202.52 --> 1209.039
but it's because well the way things are

1206.559 --> 1212.8799999999999
going it's only getting

1209.039 --> 1216.96
worse the sickness is getting

1212.88 --> 1220.2
worse and so when Freedom utterly fails

1216.96 --> 1224.64
like that and is starting to rot then

1220.2 --> 1224.64
isn't autocracy the only way to put it

1227.159 --> 1230.159
straight

1230.76 --> 1237.8799999999999
isn't it eventually forced that is the

1234.159 --> 1240.0800000000002
only thing left to do it and that's what

1237.88 --> 1243.5200000000002
I've been foreseeing for a very long

1240.08 --> 1246.84
time the unrepented nature of Sinners

1243.52 --> 1249.84
I've actually tracked

1246.84 --> 1252.28
Sinners and I would like have them

1249.84 --> 1256.1999999999998
confined in me and basically say like

1252.28 --> 1258.799
yeah what you do your ugliness your

1256.2 --> 1262.64
Gress whatever you're doing or or even

1258.799 --> 1265.28
like heavier crime I would like a

1262.64 --> 1270.0
psychologist say like yeah

1265.28 --> 1274.279
I it's safe with me for real why because

1270.0 --> 1276.72
I'm studying it I'm studying people and

1274.279 --> 1279.24
I'm studying this sin and why people sin

1276.72 --> 1282.24
and what it leads to trying to find out

1279.24 --> 1285.0
if there is a actually an occult

1282.24 --> 1290.0
function to it that is just always

1285.0 --> 1295.2
overlooked and to figure out

1290.0 --> 1295.2
a percentage of of seeking of

1295.32 --> 1302.84
redemption to see if through the average

1298.84 --> 1305.6789999999999
of Freedom that sinning would eventually

1302.84 --> 1305.6789999999999
always just

1306.44 --> 1313.279
end but it turns out through the various

1310.279 --> 1316.08
levels of people that I

1313.279 --> 1319.52
faced arguably even in the dark world

1316.08 --> 1322.48
not even in the real world

1319.52 --> 1327.12
cuz I doubt that I like Met George Soros

1322.48 --> 1330.4
face to face in the physical real world

1327.12 --> 1333.36
right that would be super freaky if that

1330.4 --> 1334.96
actually happened if I had then at the

1333.36 --> 1336.4799999999998
time I probably wouldn't even know who

1334.96 --> 1339.52
he

1336.48 --> 1342.84
was so it was probably Vision

1339.52 --> 1345.799
related but I was just always trying to

1342.84 --> 1348.08
investigate things and sometimes I

1345.799 --> 1350.0
wouldn't even ask questions I would just

1348.08 --> 1352.84
study the way they looked and how they

1350.0 --> 1354.72
responded or especially didn't

1352.84 --> 1357.1589999999999
respond cuz they could read the

1354.72 --> 1357.159
spiritual

1361.52 --> 1372.48
metadata and my findings on average were

1366.4 --> 1372.48
very very warning or yeah unnerving

1374.12 --> 1378.2399999999998
disappointing is that there is like

1376.44 --> 1380.48
plenty of dark people that really really

1378.24 --> 1385.32
cling on to the dark side and that is

1380.48 --> 1385.32
not just like for some temporary

1385.44 --> 1391.3200000000002
delusion it means full surrender full

1388.88 --> 1394.5590000000002
surrender to

1391.32 --> 1397.279
Satan where they will absolutely if it

1394.559 --> 1399.76
just happens to happen take it all the

1397.279 --> 1403.4
way to like the most horrific Darkness

1399.76 --> 1406.8799999999999
you could imagine without any

1403.4 --> 1409.88
objection and there's a lot of those

1406.88 --> 1409.88
people

1414.96 --> 1422.1200000000001
and a lot of them are in control

1417.96 --> 1422.1200000000001
positions and everybody's let

1424.159 --> 1430.96
them okay there's some crazy idiot here

1428.279 --> 1435.44
in like from the Netherlands that's

1430.96 --> 1440.44
literally now trying to force us to to

1435.44 --> 1443.1200000000001
strip away the rules against GMO that I

1440.44 --> 1445.159
personally with a whole with like

1443.12 --> 1449.6789999999999
hundreds of thousand of Dutch people

1445.159 --> 1451.44
protested very hard like a decade ago or

1449.679 --> 1454.72
more was

1451.44 --> 1456.76
it yeah a little over a decade ago to

1454.72 --> 1458.96
like get GMO out of the Netherlands

1456.76 --> 1462.679
completely to make it forbid and he's

1458.96 --> 1465.64
now just just like that just like oh for

1462.679 --> 1467.64
the climate change or whatever with wef

1465.64 --> 1470.3200000000002
he's just like oh we're just taking away

1467.64 --> 1470.3200000000002
the rules

1471.52 --> 1475.2
like that's what's

1479.159 --> 1485.2
happening yeah we were all so proud that

1482.799 --> 1487.52
we could like demonstrate and really

1485.2 --> 1489.159
like let it be known like we won't

1487.52 --> 1491.32
accept this and then the government

1489.159 --> 1494.6000000000001
would like make it

1491.32 --> 1497.48
so and now just some [ __ ] crazy

1494.6 --> 1502.32
autocrat is just like throwing it all

1497.48 --> 1502.32
aside without even like asking

1509.35 --> 1513.77
[Music]

1516.33 --> 1519.4099999999999
[Music]

1521.32 --> 1531.12
anything so yeah as this continues a pet

1526.64 --> 1534.8400000000001
turning point is really becoming

1531.12 --> 1534.84
less and less

1546.039 --> 1553.1589999999999
avoidable and by the way like f form for

1549.559 --> 1557.0
democracy that party that I kind of

1553.159 --> 1558.24
Follow that are like they're like really

1557.0 --> 1561.0
getting now

1558.24 --> 1563.6
like rolled on

1561.0 --> 1564.84
crazy like they're trying to actually

1563.6 --> 1568.76
like

1564.84 --> 1572.279
just forbid them from being a party even

1568.76 --> 1572.279
politically and for

1573.2 --> 1579.76
what for resisting for resisting the

1576.52 --> 1582.52
agendas unlike all the other parties

1579.76 --> 1586.52
that are all as corrupt as

1582.52 --> 1588.12
hell they really are supposed resisting

1586.52 --> 1594.0
parties they'll

1588.12 --> 1594.0
vote on these WF giant project just like

1595.919 --> 1601.0
that it's completely corrupted

1601.32 --> 1608.1589999999999
here like on a corporate level so like

1605.6 --> 1609.799
our country is like a corporatocracy at

1608.159 --> 1613.0390000000002
this

1609.799 --> 1614.24
point corporations have taken up shop in

1613.039 --> 1618.12
the

1614.24 --> 1620.159
government and are just now

1618.12 --> 1622.84
without any restraint

1620.159 --> 1626.3600000000001
psychopathically like choosing to have

1622.84 --> 1629.48
the public exploited however they see

1626.36 --> 1629.4799999999998
[Music]

1635.0 --> 1638.0
fit

1641.88 --> 1646.5200000000002
anyway and that's why I get a little

1644.039 --> 1649.52
extreme every now and

1646.52 --> 1649.52
then

1654.84 --> 1662.12
cuz I'm like kind of fanatically trying

1659.32 --> 1664.799
to like how do we like psychologically

1662.12 --> 1664.799
break these

1665.24 --> 1670.96
people and really the only way I can

1667.96 --> 1673.519
think of is to

1670.96 --> 1675.44
just torture

1673.519 --> 1678.48
them

1675.44 --> 1681.3990000000001
overtly like make it really painful and

1678.48 --> 1682.96
make it seem like hey hey hey this is

1681.399 --> 1686.32
what

1682.96 --> 1689.279
happens like that's what actual traitors

1686.32 --> 1690.84
get oh yeah yeah yeah nobody said it I

1689.279 --> 1692.799
could just move along and everybody just

1690.84 --> 1696.84
played along yeah yeah but this is what

1692.799 --> 1701.1589999999999
actually happens to traitors a torturous

1696.84 --> 1703.6399999999999
death like undeniably horrendous and

1701.159 --> 1706.44
that's what's coming for you when you

1703.64 --> 1709.44
engage with that sort of

1706.44 --> 1709.44
thing

1712.0 --> 1717.44
the problem is is that if you choose to

1714.64 --> 1720.519
do it

1717.44 --> 1723.44
oh all kinds of craziness will start to

1720.519 --> 1726.2
bloom up like

1723.44 --> 1728.6000000000001
a like a mushroom filled with sports

1726.2 --> 1731.0800000000002
just exploding as soon as you do that

1728.6 --> 1733.039
and you'll be a war criminal or whatever

1731.08 --> 1735.559
or

1733.039 --> 1739.2
something they'll try to make everybody

1735.559 --> 1742.519
negatively obsessed with you

1739.2 --> 1747.2
and yeah and you deal like how do you

1742.519 --> 1747.2
deal judicially with it

1748.84 --> 1755.279
like actions like that the creepy thing

1752.12 --> 1759.12
about it is it only works when like the

1755.279 --> 1761.76
judicial system completely agrees with

1759.12 --> 1763.9189999999999
it and that's part of the crazy things

1761.76 --> 1767.64
about like Nazi Germany is that like

1763.919 --> 1768.919
they had the judges like the judges are

1767.64 --> 1773.64
like

1768.919 --> 1776.64
yeah yeah get them shoot them on the

1773.64 --> 1778.88
street and that's basically why that

1776.64 --> 1781.0800000000002
happened and of course it's completely

1778.88 --> 1782.6000000000001
insane that those judges allowed it to

1781.08 --> 1786.1999999999998
go that

1782.6 --> 1791.6
far but like I can't go after anybody

1786.2 --> 1791.6000000000001
and basically go completely AP [ __ ] on

1792.64 --> 1798.3600000000001
them if I'm not

1795.84 --> 1801.76
backed like I'm not just going to be

1798.36 --> 1804.039
some crazy psycho killer and just like

1801.76 --> 1806.12
go at one of them and then basically

1804.039 --> 1810.1299999999999
yeah that's my life then literally

1806.12 --> 1812.12
everything's gone I'm not going to do

1810.13 --> 1815.24
[Music]

1812.12 --> 1819.1589999999999
that but it is like my political

1815.24 --> 1821.679
position that these people should be

1819.159 --> 1824.8400000000001
apprehended thoroughly

1821.679 --> 1828.2
investigated very roughly investigated

1824.84 --> 1830.36
all of them and then like the real key

1828.2 --> 1833.1200000000001
players the the ones that kept the whole

1830.36 --> 1838.36
thing together that pushed others that

1833.12 --> 1838.36
they get like publicly punished

1839.32 --> 1847.8799999999999
brutally and potentially at the end like

1844.519 --> 1849.84
executed but I mean I wouldn't be shy of

1847.88 --> 1853.72
like just putting them on a pole and

1849.84 --> 1856.4399999999998
just [ __ ] whipping them with a steel

1853.72 --> 1860.0
whip in public just like like oh

1856.44 --> 1863.279
Medieval Time are back yeah yeah thank

1860.0 --> 1864.6
God thank God that actual [ __ ] up

1863.279 --> 1869.679
overt

1864.6 --> 1872.0
criminals like with Glee like slow

1869.679 --> 1874.519
killing their own public and robbing

1872.0 --> 1877.919
them and sending it to like genocidal

1874.519 --> 1877.919
Maniacs that are just

1878.72 --> 1883.84
like eager to fight losing Wars and

1882.039 --> 1886.1589999999999
getting millions of people killed and

1883.84 --> 1888.519
all that like yeah those people need to

1886.159 --> 1892.1200000000001
be Savage

1888.519 --> 1894.1200000000001
punished that's right they need to be

1892.12 --> 1896.5189999999998
reminded of what the [ __ ] they're

1894.12 --> 1899.0
actually

1896.519 --> 1901.919
doing because they're probably all just

1899.0 --> 1903.88
in a trance of like oh we can't lose now

1901.919 --> 1905.72
we got the winning positions and there's

1903.88 --> 1909.159
nothing that can stop us even when we

1905.72 --> 1913.1200000000001
lose we win yeah that's where they're at

1909.159 --> 1916.3600000000001
now these crazy [ __ ] up Elites they're

1913.12 --> 1919.1589999999999
in the psychological position even if we

1916.36 --> 1919.1589999999999
lose we

1921.0 --> 1928.0
win which will make them

1923.6 --> 1930.519
go to like unbelievable damaging

1928.0 --> 1932.32
scenarios they will cause unbelievably

1930.519 --> 1934.36
damaging scenarios because they think

1932.32 --> 1938.24
that doesn't really matter anymore what

1934.36 --> 1938.24
they do they can't

1938.84 --> 1946.1999999999998
lose and you have to snap them out of

1942.76 --> 1949.519
it and just like oh you can't continue

1946.2 --> 1951.96
any further don't thread on this part

1949.519 --> 1951.96
isn't

1954.84 --> 1962.84
enough it'll keep you safe for a

1959.2 --> 1962.8400000000001
bit but it's not

1966.45 --> 1979.039
[Music]

1975.039 --> 1979.039
enough responsible teacher

1982.08 --> 1988.1589999999999
yeah although I mean if you're a teacher

1985.08 --> 1991.1999999999998
and you're like teaching gross [ __ ] up

1988.159 --> 1995.48
LGBT [ __ ] to

1991.2 --> 1998.1200000000001
children that's yeah it all depends

1995.48 --> 2000.6
right I

1998.12 --> 2002.639
mean if you're like trying to mind

2000.6 --> 2004.279
control kids and like telling them to

2002.639 --> 2005.799
hide things from their parents yeah

2004.279 --> 2008.88
that's [ __ ] up and that should

2005.799 --> 2011.0
absolutely be

2008.88 --> 2012.519
like classified differently as just a

2011.0 --> 2014.519
teacher that's just like yeah I have to

2012.519 --> 2015.96
teach this I don't even agree with this

2014.519 --> 2018.84
and that is definitely not going to

2015.96 --> 2022.919
force any of it on the kids right it's a

2018.84 --> 2027.1999999999998
big difference but I mean

2022.919 --> 2030.24
that's that's like one of the lower tier

2027.2 --> 2032.72
things like as soon as that's just not

2030.24 --> 2035.2
allowed

2032.72 --> 2038.96
anymore which could easily happen I mean

2035.2 --> 2038.96
it can easily be forbidden and then it's

2039.72 --> 2045.48
stops but it's not as bad as like the

2042.44 --> 2048.76
whole vac situation what they did with

2045.48 --> 2050.919
that and the Ukraine war and how all the

2048.76 --> 2053.5600000000004
media just helped along with it and

2050.919 --> 2055.96
keeps still promoting this [ __ ] like

2053.56 --> 2059.04
that part is really like that is really

2055.96 --> 2061.52
terrible I mean if I get to say the

2059.04 --> 2065.48
media is like going to get a real ass

2061.52 --> 2065.48
whooping very very

2065.72 --> 2070.839
serious like those media generals that

2068.679 --> 2073.52
are like doing all that they all

2070.839 --> 2073.52
actually get

2079.2 --> 2084.52
arrested they're not the news readers

2081.48 --> 2084.52
and all that they're just

2086.28 --> 2090.2400000000002
flunkies they'll just get fired and then

2088.879 --> 2091.839
then what are you going to do where are

2090.24 --> 2096.0789999999997
you going to find work

2091.839 --> 2098.119
now you just spent your career lying to

2096.079 --> 2099.7200000000003
everybody and getting them killed and

2098.119 --> 2101.56
got paid and what happens when you don't

2099.72 --> 2104.52
get paid anymore yeah now you just got

2101.56 --> 2107.359
left with everybody knows you for lying

2104.52 --> 2109.32
to them and getting their family killed

2107.359 --> 2112.0
yeah so good luck with that that should

2109.32 --> 2114.56
be punishment enough for them for the

2112.0 --> 2114.56
stupid news

2118.0 --> 2125.24
readers but yeah the the actual people

2121.32 --> 2125.2400000000002
behind the scenes coordinating all

2125.8 --> 2131.449
that

2128.35 --> 2131.449
[Music]

2133.4 --> 2137.88
anyway so that's another part that's

2135.52 --> 2137.88
kind of

2146.839 --> 2151.52
extreme right and those factors those

2149.319 --> 2154.079
two different sides the homophobia and

2151.52 --> 2157.4
that it really does kind

2154.079 --> 2158.5600000000004
of ruin a bit of the fun

2157.4 --> 2161.599
it makes

2158.56 --> 2166.2
me like more serious even if there's

2161.599 --> 2169.76
like social situations like in the chat

2166.2 --> 2172.2
happening I might overreact because well

2169.76 --> 2174.84
those things are also kind of weighing

2172.2 --> 2178.0589999999997
in the distance on

2174.84 --> 2178.059
[Music]

2179.319 --> 2184.7599999999998
me I can't just PE I can't just let

2182.28 --> 2186.88
people just like completely [ __ ] around

2184.76 --> 2190.76
and screw around in my chat and like

2186.88 --> 2193.56
it's all fun in games like no it's

2190.76 --> 2194.8390000000004
no I mean you can May a bit jokey and

2193.56 --> 2200.0789999999997
all that

2194.839 --> 2200.0789999999997
sure but not like out of control not

2200.48 --> 2205.4
ballistic not like oh but it's funny

2203.2 --> 2207.359
time now I'm going to keep it funny even

2205.4 --> 2212.44
if Arwin doesn't want to that or

2207.359 --> 2215.2799999999997
whatever like no no anyway

2212.44 --> 2217.44
enough should Ballers be punished for

2215.28 --> 2221.599
spreading Globe information

2217.44 --> 2221.599
no they should just be classified as a

2227.48 --> 2233.28
religion if you do that like

2230.04 --> 2233.2799999999997
everything's solved very

2244.76 --> 2251.119
quickly and I mean everything everything

2247.44 --> 2253.839
will be solved very quickly right no

2251.119 --> 2257.2400000000002
more nagging against Christians and all

2253.839 --> 2259.7599999999998
that cuz Christians will then just say

2257.24 --> 2262.319
like okay well we have our religion you

2259.76 --> 2264.6400000000003
have your religion it's not a religion

2262.319 --> 2267.7599999999998
yeah yeah it

2264.64 --> 2270.5989999999997
is officially it is whether you're going

2267.76 --> 2270.599
to accept that or

2273.319 --> 2280.359
not so no moon moonroof

2277.839 --> 2280.359
don't be

2286.04 --> 2290.359
silly Newton and heliocentric

2288.56 --> 2293.359
information

2290.359 --> 2293.359
No

2298.0 --> 2304.72
Nonsense no of why wouldn't they no I

2301.44 --> 2307.2400000000002
disagree it should be able to be

2304.72 --> 2310.52
taught it's just that

2307.24 --> 2313.0789999999997
if there's somebody opposing it they

2310.52 --> 2314.96
shouldn't be like cornered off and

2313.079 --> 2318.599
punished or

2314.96 --> 2320.2
shamed if they're disruptive yeah I mean

2318.599 --> 2322.599
if somebody's like okay I'm going to

2320.2 --> 2324.72
teach you Newtonian mechanics now it's

2322.599 --> 2326.44
like neutronian mechanics debunked and

2324.72 --> 2328.56
he's like continually say neuton's

2326.44 --> 2332.2400000000002
mechanic debunk yeah that's called being

2328.56 --> 2335.16
disrupted get out right it's very cute

2332.24 --> 2335.16
I'm teaching this

2335.52 --> 2338.52
now

2339.76 --> 2344.88
but if there's like almost a cult around

2342.079 --> 2348.4
this guy in about it and like he's

2344.88 --> 2350.28
telling kids to like snitch if somebody

2348.4 --> 2352.56
actually thinks that it's not a globe or

2350.28 --> 2355.599
something yeah that's really [ __ ]

2352.56 --> 2358.16
up it's going to like punish like treat

2355.599 --> 2360.2400000000002
people like lower class citizens if they

2358.16 --> 2361.2
believe in something else for example

2360.24 --> 2364.52
yeah

2361.2 --> 2367.24
that's that's

2364.52 --> 2368.839
abuse right but just because a teacher

2367.24 --> 2369.9199999999996
is into the globe or whatever it

2368.839 --> 2373.68
shouldn't

2369.92 --> 2376.52
matter right and if it's officially

2373.68 --> 2378.64
classified as a religion it really

2376.52 --> 2382.56
solves a lot of

2378.64 --> 2384.0
problems it really does just by that one

2382.56 --> 2387.359
action just

2384.0 --> 2387.359
say it's

2388.04 --> 2391.04
religion

2392.2 --> 2399.4399999999996
poof you could dude it could even be

2395.56 --> 2402.48
like as weird as being an official state

2399.44 --> 2407.599
declaration like we

2402.48 --> 2410.28
declare Globe Earth and outer

2407.599 --> 2414.599
space and and like

2410.28 --> 2417.119
uh an evolution to be the state

2414.599 --> 2419.52
religion to say it like that not like

2417.119 --> 2422.92
this is our

2419.52 --> 2425.839
position no it's the state religion if

2422.92 --> 2427.44
they would if the state would officially

2425.839 --> 2430.68
like Clare

2427.44 --> 2433.44
that that would be freaking

2430.68 --> 2436.04
amazing and the consequences could be

2433.44 --> 2438.319
extreme like much more than you would

2436.04 --> 2438.319
think

2445.28 --> 2452.2400000000002
it I'll be jumping back over for the tax

2449.24 --> 2452.24
breaks

2454.56 --> 2460.119
wow well o

2457.88 --> 2462.28
the funny thing is if it's classified as

2460.119 --> 2465.319
a religion like it doesn't mean that it

2462.28 --> 2467.96
that you're going to get tax breaks

2465.319 --> 2469.96
though you would get tax breaks if you

2467.96 --> 2472.119
had special

2469.96 --> 2474.56
Globe

2472.119 --> 2477.04
churches where you gather specifically

2474.56 --> 2480.0789999999997
for globe Believers

2477.04 --> 2482.4
right you would get tax cuts with that

2480.079 --> 2484.599
perhaps so yeah it would probably even

2482.4 --> 2486.76
be like hey this is actually a business

2484.599 --> 2489.839
opportunity let's declare

2486.76 --> 2492.7200000000003
the ball Earth a religion an actual

2489.839 --> 2496.44
business opportunity yeah how crazy

2492.72 --> 2497.9599999999996
would that be I never even thought of

2496.44 --> 2500.96
that

2497.96 --> 2500.96
oh

2501.04 --> 2506.839
wow that they actually just say no we

2504.4 --> 2509.44
are declaring a religion

2506.839 --> 2511.2
because we can get out of something out

2509.44 --> 2514.96
of that

2511.2 --> 2517.4399999999996
wow but I mean it would not be long

2514.96 --> 2519.48
after that after well flat earthers

2517.44 --> 2522.76
would do the same thing and you would

2519.48 --> 2525.0
get dis earth religion

2522.76 --> 2527.5200000000004
declaration and then you get that tax

2525.0 --> 2527.52
exemption

2536.76 --> 2544.559
too but I mean is is tax exemption

2540.92 --> 2547.04
because of religion really worth it guys

2544.559 --> 2550.28
realize you don't get those tax

2547.04 --> 2554.4
exemptions if you don't work

2550.28 --> 2557.6800000000003
along with the state rules yeah you have

2554.4 --> 2559.96
to go along with the plan if you want

2557.68 --> 2562.44
those tax breaks

2559.96 --> 2564.48
yeah that's why all those churches in

2562.44 --> 2568.599
the United States that have those tax

2564.48 --> 2569.76
cuts it's why they all told you to put

2568.599 --> 2571.92
on a

2569.76 --> 2574.7200000000003
mask and get

2571.92 --> 2578.079
shot and support

2574.72 --> 2579.839
Ukraine yeah and all those other things

2578.079 --> 2581.92
remember yeah that why do you think that

2579.839 --> 2584.52
they were doing that you think that

2581.92 --> 2587.8
those guys just happen to be really into

2584.52 --> 2589.839
that no they did that cuz that's part of

2587.8 --> 2595.119
like you need to do that or you don't

2589.839 --> 2595.119
get the tax cuts that's the problem

2595.76 --> 2600.28
yeah but yeah with the globe it is

2598.16 --> 2602.16
already per definition corrupt so it

2600.28 --> 2605.079
wouldn't really matter like they just

2602.16 --> 2608.0789999999997
embrace all that crap

2605.079 --> 2608.079
anyway

2610.74 --> 2613.83

like the the point is is that this crazy

2755.0 --> 2758.88
era these these people when they are on

2757.44 --> 2760.96
top of things they'll think they'll get

2758.88 --> 2763.079
away with anything they do it they

2760.96 --> 2767.68
declare the global religion to get tax

2763.079 --> 2770.4100000000003
breaks because they think we're number

2767.68 --> 2773.64

3262.76 --> 3269.2000000000003
me seeing me eat them but the thing is

3265.48 --> 3272.52
is that having them in my system really

3269.2 --> 3273.64
does a lot of the times just make me

3272.52 --> 3275.799

Illuminati croissance moon rover answer

3338.76 --> 3341.28
me that

3341.599 --> 3346.6400000000003
question I

3343.96 --> 3350.44
mean they're like a

3346.64 --> 3354.0
pyramid I hold them in front of one eye

3350.44 --> 3357.0
how can it not be an Illuminati kasan

3354.0 --> 3357.0
seriously

3370.0 --> 3375.039
also they're

3371.4 --> 3378.48
vegan I think no they're not no they're

3375.039 --> 3381.65
not they're vegetarian okay never

3378.48 --> 3381.65
[Music]

3383.92 --> 3386.92
mind

3399.88 --> 3407.2000000000003
what's the price of one Illuminati kasan

3402.359 --> 3407.2
yes good question Z tappy it's

3413.88 --> 3416.88
€330

3417.4 --> 3421.96
I forgot that's another reason why it's

3419.24 --> 3424.3999999999996
also called Illuminati C but to be fair

3421.96 --> 3428.2
it's not really fair to say that because

3424.4 --> 3428.2000000000003
it only recently became

3429.039 --> 3434.1600000000003
€330 you see it used to be3 in the last

3433.039 --> 3438.7200000000003
two

3434.16 --> 3438.72
years and before that it was like

3439.64 --> 3446.44
€2

3441.359 --> 3450.2799999999997
40 but it's become €330

3446.44 --> 3450.28
like in the last in this

3454.68 --> 3463.3999999999996
summer get a pack of four for Less no I

3458.799 --> 3463.4
doubt it you you're not getting those

3466.319 --> 3471.799
organic I'm damn well sure you don't

3469.559 --> 3471.799
love

3473.48 --> 3478.039
fruit and if if you do then I need to

3475.88 --> 3481.4
know where because I want that if I

3478.039 --> 3484.2000000000003
could get these things just like in a in

3481.4 --> 3487.0
a bulk or whatever super cheap yeah I'd

3484.2 --> 3490.239
go for it but is it

3487.0 --> 3490.239
[Music]

3491.839 --> 3496.88
organic why not make my own it's because

3494.72 --> 3498.5589999999997
it isn't cheaper it's quite a lot of

3496.88 --> 3501.119
effort to make them and you need a

3498.559 --> 3504.3590000000004
proper oven to bake them in I mean I

3501.119 --> 3506.7200000000003
warm them up in this oven if I had to

3504.359 --> 3508.5589999999997
like have the dough and all that [ __ ]

3506.72 --> 3511.52
you think that would come out well in

3508.559 --> 3513.3190000000004
this oven over here no it wouldn't at

3511.52 --> 3517.119
[Music]

3513.319 --> 3517.119
all that's pretty

3519.96 --> 3525.88
difficult it isn't much cheaper I mean

3523.24 --> 3528.0389999999998
it would be much cheaper if I like had

3525.88 --> 3529.6800000000003
half a bakery or a super elaborate

3528.039 --> 3531.8390000000004
kitchen where I made a whole bunch of

3529.68 --> 3534.52
things yeah then it would be

3531.839 --> 3537.319
cheaper if I from the position where I'm

3534.52 --> 3539.839
at now had to just like oh I'm going to

3537.319 --> 3542.0
do it instead yeah guess what it's not

3539.839 --> 3545.119
going to be cheaper at

3542.0 --> 3546.599
all it's going to be more expensive and

3545.119 --> 3547.96
it's going to fail a lot of the time

3546.599 --> 3552.2000000000003
it's not even going to look like a

3547.96 --> 3552.2
proper pyramid so

3555.559 --> 3560.28
no it's only cheaper if you make yeah

3558.44 --> 3563.64
exactly 20 of them where the hell am I

3560.28 --> 3566.0
going to keep 20 Illuminati

3563.64 --> 3567.5989999999997
cant

3566.0 --> 3569.799
well technically I could keep them in

3567.599 --> 3569.799
the

3571.559 --> 3577.52
freezer yeah it's potentially doable but

3575.76 --> 3580.3590000000004
my God is

3577.52 --> 3582.44
that like the thing is I'd have to like

3580.359 --> 3584.319
go through failing a bunch of times

3582.44 --> 3586.799
before I even get to that point and

3584.319 --> 3589.0
besides it requires initial investment

3586.799 --> 3593.2
to get like all of the material no I'm

3589.0 --> 3593.2
just not how about I just don't do

3593.64 --> 3599.0
that

3596.0 --> 3603.039
I think it's a lot cheaper if I just

3599.0 --> 3603.039
don't eat Illuminati C

3613.319 --> 3620.079
then 92 per month yeah if I'd actually

3617.24 --> 3620.0789999999997
eat one every

3623.559 --> 3626.559
day

well yeah

3641.079 --> 3644.52
whatever that's right

3644.88 --> 3651.6400000000003
sepy that's exactly

3647.72 --> 3655.48
right and besides like the the people

3651.64 --> 3657.92
that made those things were like Bakers

3655.48 --> 3660.96
really knew how to plan it out it's like

3657.92 --> 3662.7200000000003
a product that they

3660.96 --> 3666.319
designed

3662.72 --> 3670.16
okay I'm not even a baker I don't even

3666.319 --> 3674.119
know how to make pastries and all

3670.16 --> 3676.5989999999997
that like yeah I've I've rolled up cant

3674.119 --> 3679.96
do and and made a basic croissant like

3676.599 --> 3682.96
that's about as far as it goes

3679.96 --> 3685.079
really but to actually make like a a

3682.96 --> 3686.76
thing like that with stuff in it like

3685.079 --> 3690.6800000000003
the feeling and all

3686.76 --> 3690.6800000000003
that I'm sorry I'm

3693.0 --> 3698.4
just I mean hypothetically let's say I

3969.599 --> 3978.2000000000003
bats yeah no crickets are great food

3974.039 --> 3981.599
for things like bats or

3978.2 --> 3985.3999999999996
snakes or like little

3981.599 --> 3988.48
uh like salamanders

3985.4 --> 3991.119
right people have pets like that yeah

3988.48 --> 3994.359
crickets

3991.119 --> 3997.4
great like crickets are like good pet

3994.359 --> 4000.0
food for certain types of animals

3997.4 --> 4000.0
especially

4008.16 --> 4018.319
reptiles what am I missing

4012.44 --> 4021.599
something Co com from bats no Co is the

4018.319 --> 4021.599
flu that's

4024.039 --> 4027.44
it dirt

4031.64 --> 4040.16
alert where see Lexi

4035.96 --> 4040.16
L am I missing something

4042.92 --> 4045.92
here

4053.079 --> 4057.799
still don't hear people talk about yeah

4054.799 --> 4060.079
because it's always like people I mean

4057.799 --> 4062.96
you might not remember this if you're

4060.079 --> 4065.119
like a younger generation but like in

4062.96 --> 4067.88
the '90s and all that yeah the flu was

4065.119 --> 4071.359
always there was always annoying and

4067.88 --> 4072.92
yeah the thing is people never like to

4071.359 --> 4074.5589999999997
talk about the

4072.92 --> 4077.16
flu

4074.559 --> 4078.96
right and that's also has a logical

4077.16 --> 4081.72
reason too because yeah when you talk

4078.96 --> 4084.319
about it or when you just face somebody

4081.72 --> 4087.68
like having flu symptoms that tends to

4084.319 --> 4087.68
then trigger that in

4088.64 --> 4093.7599999999998
you through exposure so like people

4091.24 --> 4095.3999999999996
didn't like to talk about it unless it

4093.76 --> 4096.759
was going around and everybody had it

4095.4 --> 4098.2390000000005
and then yeah then everybody would be

4096.759 --> 4100.719
talking about it because everybody had

4098.239 --> 4102.839
it we all kind of forgot about that

4100.719 --> 4104.64
didn't

4102.839 --> 4109.88
we

4104.64 --> 4111.56
and so in 2020 suddenly flu season was

4109.88 --> 4114.52
just it wasn't there anymore it's like

4111.56 --> 4116.52
Mandela effect or something it just what

4114.52 --> 4120.52
do you mean flu there was never flu

4116.52 --> 4122.839000000001
season that doesn't exist it's it's co

4120.52 --> 4125.96
season

4122.839 --> 4125.96
now get

4128.239 --> 4132.799
it and then they popularize talking

4131.12 --> 4135.799
about

4132.799 --> 4135.799
it

4138.279 --> 4141.4400000000005
right because there's now legal

4139.799 --> 4144.64
implications and all

4141.44 --> 4146.599999999999
that so now suddenly the flu is like

4144.64 --> 4150.0
really

4146.6 --> 4152.52
impactful talking about it suddenly is

4150.0 --> 4154.04
not just tedious not just something to

4152.52 --> 4157.080000000001
be avoided because you might

4154.04 --> 4160.08
psychosomatically get it because of it

4157.08 --> 4162.44
now it's like oh it's a status like oh

4160.08 --> 4164.759
you got the co well that means you have

4162.44 --> 4167.5599999999995
to stay home now and this and that and

4164.759 --> 4167.56
do a test

4167.96 --> 4170.96
and

4181.04 --> 4188.08
right it's all about a war

4184.759 --> 4188.759
now yeah zy well that's not very strange

4188.08 --> 4193.719
I

4188.759 --> 4197.4
mean our leadership just like literally

4193.719 --> 4199.92
threw out like all the money we had like

4197.4 --> 4203.44
we're like one of the richest countries

4199.92 --> 4205.679
right in Europe remember that yeah well

4203.44 --> 4209.678999999999
literally our leadership just threw like

4205.679 --> 4213.64
all the money we had all everything just

4209.679 --> 4215.84
suddenly threw it towards

4213.64 --> 4218.96
Ukraine I don't think people really

4215.84 --> 4222.12
realize like how much money they just

4218.96 --> 4224.64
threw out in the garbage can

4222.12 --> 4226.88
recently it's not going to sink in for a

4224.64 --> 4228.4400000000005
while because like we're used to being

4226.88 --> 4229.64
like one of the richest countries in the

4228.44 --> 4233.5199999999995
world

4229.64 --> 4233.52
and we aren't really

4240.52 --> 4247.040000000001
anymore although I mean arguably the

4243.76 --> 4251.04
whole thing is a giant Ponzi scheme

4247.04 --> 4254.0
and if I had any grip on it I'd say like

4251.04 --> 4255.159
literally cancel it it's just like okay

4254.0 --> 4258.48
like that

4255.159 --> 4261.04
money that was stolen that's literally

4258.48 --> 4265.799999999999
not something that we are approving of

4261.04 --> 4265.8
giving away so give it back like right

4266.04 --> 4273.0
now like give it back or we literally

4269.719 --> 4276.0
break with the Euro and start our new

4273.0 --> 4279.28
currency in which we will absolutely

4276.0 --> 4281.52
never ever recognize that we gave that

4279.28 --> 4283.679
money away to that you can all go [ __ ]

4281.52 --> 4286.52
yourselves you can figure out on how to

4283.679 --> 4289.52
back that cuz i' start a new currency

4286.52 --> 4293.360000000001
for that [ __ ] everything we supposedly

4289.52 --> 4293.360000000001
had saved up just got thrown

4296.92 --> 4301.1990000000005
out so it's time to start a new

4302.159 --> 4306.36
currency military equipment yeah Zep

4304.88 --> 4308.4800000000005
tappy but that doesn't really matter

4306.36 --> 4310.159
because our military equipment is like

4308.48 --> 4314.32
outdated

4310.159 --> 4316.159
anyway we don't really need it anymore

4314.32 --> 4320.159
I mean what were we doing with it peace

4316.159 --> 4322.719
missions and all that [ __ ] I'm sorry

4320.159 --> 4322.719
it's not

4337.36 --> 4342.92
necessary it's okay no it's not funny

4339.84 --> 4346.12
Lexi L I'd hope you'd not just keep

4342.92 --> 4348.679
agitating with that sort of [ __ ]

4346.12 --> 4351.679
thanks but it's way worse than that I

4348.679 --> 4354.4
mean Ukrainian forces literally just

4351.679 --> 4356.639
blow up their own

4354.4 --> 4360.28
cities just start

4356.639 --> 4362.679
shelling like

4360.28 --> 4365.96
houses and I know why they're doing it

4362.679 --> 4368.719
too now cuz it seems like oh some kind

4365.96 --> 4372.2390000000005
of weird Nazi Terror or whatever no

4368.719 --> 4372.2390000000005
they're doing it for [ __ ] black

4372.44 --> 4375.879999999999
rock

4374.12 --> 4378.04
yeah these [ __ ]

4375.88 --> 4381.679
Nazis they're not even really

4378.04 --> 4386.159
nationalist they're literally

4381.679 --> 4389.4400000000005
pure mercenary type corporate mercenary

4386.159 --> 4392.0
Nazis and so when there's areas and

4389.44 --> 4393.678999999999
black rocks like hey you know what we

4392.0 --> 4395.44
want to build this specific type of

4393.679 --> 4397.6
building here and then we can control

4395.44 --> 4399.199
everything but there's like these living

4397.6 --> 4400.52
quarters now and they're obviously not

4399.199 --> 4403.759999999999
going to sell they've been living there

4400.52 --> 4408.0
for Generations okay just could you guys

4403.76 --> 4411.88
blow that up okay sir and these [ __ ]

4408.0 --> 4415.0
Nazi soldiers they just like okay fire

4411.88 --> 4417.6
over there and they just start blowing

4415.0 --> 4419.639
up a town just like the boom boom boom

4417.6 --> 4421.360000000001
boom total everything destroyed all

4419.639 --> 4424.6
kinds of people killed and everybody's

4421.36 --> 4424.599999999999
like why why did you do

4424.92 --> 4430.6
that yeah because later that shit's

4428.76 --> 4432.320000000001
going to be bought up by Black Rock so

4430.6 --> 4434.159000000001
they could build their little project

4432.32 --> 4436.759999999999
there that they always wanted

4434.159 --> 4440.44
and that's what they're doing

4436.76 --> 4443.4400000000005
now that's why these [ __ ] Ukrainian

4440.44 --> 4445.48
Nazis are blowing up their own

4443.44 --> 4448.36
civilians for

4445.48 --> 4451.759999999999
nothing because they're doing it for

4448.36 --> 4453.44
corporate investors that want those

4451.76 --> 4456.0
places

4453.44 --> 4458.719
cheap and it's oh it's a hazard of War

4456.0 --> 4461.4
oh just they just blew it up for nothing

4458.719 --> 4465.36
their own people oh but we're going to

4461.4 --> 4468.5599999999995
buy it up ah yeah that's exactly what's

4465.36 --> 4472.5599999999995
happening Ukrainian Nazi soldiers get

4468.56 --> 4476.080000000001
ordered to just shell with

4472.56 --> 4476.080000000001
bombs just

4476.44 --> 4483.32
towns towns with Ukrainian people in

4480.76 --> 4486.2390000000005
them that have not resisted or anything

4483.32 --> 4488.199
they just blow them up why because

4486.239 --> 4491.159
there's a project

4488.199 --> 4494.239
there and this way the corporations

4491.159 --> 4496.96
black rock mostly can just really cheap

4494.239 --> 4499.159
after the war [ __ ] has stopped well they

4496.96 --> 4501.719
would have already bought it

4499.159 --> 4503.879999999999
out like they would have already like

4501.719 --> 4507.52
provided all the funds necessary to

4503.88 --> 4510.1990000000005
literally like repair the damage and own

4507.52 --> 4512.320000000001
it cuz that town isn't going to get

4510.199 --> 4515.0
funds to clean that up and restore it

4512.32 --> 4517.599999999999
the way it was no it's already been

4515.0 --> 4520.96
bought out like as soon as those bombs

4517.6 --> 4522.96
exploded and the town was like crushed

4520.96 --> 4526.92
that's like that second it's just like

4522.96 --> 4528.4800000000005
black rock is just with a wall of money

4526.92 --> 4530.96
ready to break through and it's just

4528.48 --> 4533.879999999999
boom boom boom and oh we got all the

4530.96 --> 4536.639
money you need we're going to repair it

4533.88 --> 4536.639
but we own it

4539.96 --> 4545.4800000000005
[Music]

4541.199 --> 4549.839999999999
now so there you go that's

4545.48 --> 4552.638999999999
why Ukrainian soldiers just blow up

4549.84 --> 4553.84
random towns of Ukrainian people for

4552.639 --> 4556.159000000001
nothing when they the Russians aren't

4553.84 --> 4558.88
even there or even planning to go there

4556.159 --> 4561.719
or nothing eventful happened no traitors

4558.88 --> 4564.6
or whatever were found or anything just

4561.719 --> 4568.28
random peaceful towns just getting blown

4564.6 --> 4570.679
up by Ukrainian soldiers getting shelled

4568.28 --> 4572.28
not just one random bomb Oh we

4570.679 --> 4574.0
accidentally fired no they just keep

4572.28 --> 4575.96
shelling and shelling and shelling until

4574.0 --> 4579.12
it's all [ __ ]

4575.96 --> 4581.719
craters yeah makes no sense yeah it does

4579.12 --> 4583.88
make sense they're blowing it up for

4581.719 --> 4585.4800000000005
Black Rock

4583.88 --> 4588.159000000001
that's why that's

4585.48 --> 4591.04
happening you heard it here on the Flat

4588.159 --> 4591.04
Earth early bird

4591.8 --> 4597.12
show remember that you heard it here

4594.76 --> 4598.84
first maybe maybe you already heard this

4597.12 --> 4601.4
somewhere else I mean I'm not the first

4598.84 --> 4604.719
one that's going to come up with what's

4601.4 --> 4604.719
going on in that

4612.08 --> 4616.87
sense

4613.66 --> 4616.87
[Music]

4622.8 --> 4628.679
would they go back to the

4625.44 --> 4628.678999999999
Gilder the

4628.719 --> 4635.56
hen well low fruit I

4631.76 --> 4638.88
mean potentially if if we still

4635.56 --> 4642.2390000000005
have like Bankers that aren't just

4638.88 --> 4645.4400000000005
completely [ __ ] satanic then perhaps

4642.239 --> 4645.44
we could go back to the

4646.88 --> 4651.719
Giller are there still any Bankers that

4649.36 --> 4654.04
aren't just full on

4651.719 --> 4656.4
satanic cuz that certainly doesn't

4654.04 --> 4658.5199999999995
really seem like that all these Mainline

4656.4 --> 4661.36
Banks here they're all doing the [ __ ]

4658.52 --> 4665.040000000001
up WF agenda all of

4661.36 --> 4667.08
them with trans kids and everything

4665.04 --> 4668.719
everything horrific you can think of

4667.08 --> 4670.8
that's rolling out they're part of it

4668.719 --> 4673.4800000000005
and they're flaunting with it really

4670.8 --> 4676.52
sickly they're for censorship ship

4673.48 --> 4681.12
they're ready they literally okay my

4676.52 --> 4683.96
bank disabled me from actually using my

4681.12 --> 4686.88
credit card to pay Owen Benjamin to get

4683.96 --> 4689.28
to be part of unauthorized.tv they just

4686.88 --> 4692.159000000001
without saying anything nothing it's

4689.28 --> 4694.239
just like it just bounces it whenever I

4692.159 --> 4696.36
try to use it just bounces it it's just

4694.239 --> 4700.12
yeah we're just not enabling you to do

4696.36 --> 4700.12
that without saying why or

4701.92 --> 4704.92
anything

4707.6 --> 4711.679
I was subscribed for months was great

4710.12 --> 4714.28
and then suddenly oh it doesn't work

4711.679 --> 4714.28
anymore

4716.8 --> 4722.4400000000005
oh it's just

4719.28 --> 4726.44
five $5 a

4722.44 --> 4726.44
month and they just cut it

4727.08 --> 4733.6
off right so yeah if we want any kind of

4731.92 --> 4735.639
new

4733.6 --> 4739.0
currency there's going to have to be

4735.639 --> 4741.12
banks that are not totally [ __ ]

4739.0 --> 4742.48
satanic otherwise there's no point

4741.12 --> 4744.4
there's no point in starting a new

4742.48 --> 4746.678999999999
currency we might just as well go with

4744.4 --> 4750.239
pure trade based currency like no

4746.679 --> 4750.2390000000005

4948.32 --> 4953.44
yeah don't worry Lexi L I was actually

4950.6 --> 4955.360000000001
addressing the the gamma that just

4953.44 --> 4959.239
popped up right before

4955.36 --> 4959.239
you that I immediately

4971.56 --> 4974.56
banned

4976.92 --> 4982.4400000000005
yeah oroo wumble I know I banned them it

4980.239 --> 4985.0
was

4982.44 --> 4987.719
rhetorical I didn't actually expect them

4985.0 --> 4990.84
to answer me after I banned them I'm not

4987.719 --> 4990.84
I'm not a weirdo like

5001.48 --> 5004.48
that

[Music]

5024.48 --> 5026.959999999999
hey Len

5031.48 --> 5034.48
lanox

5038.639 --> 5042.92
all right but yeah I just wanted to

5040.12 --> 5045.32
point out that this model what I just

5042.92 --> 5049.32
described is kind of like the

5045.32 --> 5052.719
new hyper fascist

5049.32 --> 5056.719
model right that's what fascism always

5052.719 --> 5060.0
was like merger of Corporations and

5056.719 --> 5062.6
state well what could be more fascistic

5060.0 --> 5065.04
than a corporation telling the military

5062.6 --> 5067.400000000001
to blow up civilians so that they can

5065.04 --> 5067.4
buy it

5067.96 --> 5075.32
up it is like the ultimate fascist

5071.76 --> 5078.08
move and it is the equal encounter

5075.32 --> 5080.44
opposition to the way that extreme

5078.08 --> 5083.32
communist China does

5080.44 --> 5086.08
things I mean they don't even need to do

5083.32 --> 5088.639
that they just go there and like it's

5086.08 --> 5088.639
ours

5089.04 --> 5096.44
now right so that's kind of what is

5093.719 --> 5099.36
opposes that's what it replaces it's the

5096.44 --> 5099.36
other side of

5099.679 --> 5105.96
extremity communist just like oh it's we

5102.88 --> 5110.159000000001
just decide it's ours

5105.96 --> 5113.88
now and the Neo super fascists they just

5110.159 --> 5116.638999999999
like have mil bribe military or whatever

5113.88 --> 5118.719
they just order them to just blow up

5116.639 --> 5120.4800000000005
civilians they just blow them up and

5118.719 --> 5122.119
then buy it up that's the difference

5120.48 --> 5125.239
yeah communist they just come in say

5122.119 --> 5128.159
this is ours now leave or die it's

5125.239 --> 5131.36
almost like communism is better in that

5128.159 --> 5133.679
sense or less

5131.36 --> 5137.32
terrible cuz they'll probably just give

5133.679 --> 5140.639
you a chance to vacate while with these

5137.32 --> 5143.92
[ __ ] Nazis you don't even know and

5140.639 --> 5143.92
then suddenly you get blown

5144.92 --> 5149.0

5327.84 --> 5330.56
wouldn't you guys

5331.0 --> 5335.719
say

5332.6 --> 5339.360000000001
what was the tax breaks you can

5335.719 --> 5341.96
get I don't know

5339.36 --> 5343.4
like you can just have a church of the

5341.96 --> 5345.92
globe and

5343.4 --> 5347.44
then have those tax breaked as long as

5345.92 --> 5350.28
you do what the government

5347.44 --> 5351.879999999999
says right but Globe [ __ ] already do

5350.28 --> 5355.599999999999
that

5351.88 --> 5359.28
anyway so they would have no problem

5355.6 --> 5359.280000000001
getting securing those tax

5360.92 --> 5363.92
breaks

5366.76 --> 5369.1990000000005
am I

5380.52 --> 5387.52
[Music]

5383.6 --> 5389.4800000000005
right we should keep a book of

5387.52 --> 5391.4400000000005
predictions what exactly was the

5389.48 --> 5393.4
prediction that I made did I make a

5391.44 --> 5396.719
prediction

5393.4 --> 5399.32
today oh I guess about the glob now what

5396.719 --> 5402.8
it's I'm not really predicting it I'm

5399.32 --> 5402.799999999999
just saying they could do

5407.159 --> 5412.48
that I'm saying it could be I didn't

5410.639 --> 5414.2390000000005
really say like this is definitely going

5412.48 --> 5416.48
to happen no I'm not saying like the

5414.239 --> 5417.4
globe is going to officially be declared

5416.48 --> 5420.839999999999
their

5417.4 --> 5423.839999999999
religion I'm just saying they could do

5420.84 --> 5423.84
it

5429.239 --> 5433.36
Church of the globe would suck be like

5431.04 --> 5435.08
school over yeah no [ __ ] that's exactly

5433.36 --> 5439.04
what it would be but akumu virus there's

5435.08 --> 5443.04
a whole bunch of people that love

5439.04 --> 5445.5199999999995
that they love that part of school about

5443.04 --> 5448.96
it they want to go back to school they

5445.52 --> 5452.1990000000005
miss school so they will go to Globe

5448.96 --> 5454.92
church because it's like yes finally we

5452.199 --> 5458.4
can have we can do that

5454.92 --> 5461.719
again it'll be like reenactment happy

5458.4 --> 5461.719
making time for

5463.4 --> 5469.719
them yeah I mean seriously the Church of

5467.52 --> 5472.0
globe would be super popular once it

5469.719 --> 5472.0
gets

5473.159 --> 5479.119
going all the numpties that normally

5475.92 --> 5482.1990000000005
have to go around and stalk and nag flat

5479.119 --> 5484.759999999999
earther suddenly have a place to go they

5482.199 --> 5486.638999999999
have a real family instead of just being

5484.76 --> 5490.04
surrounded by other nasty gamas they

5486.639 --> 5491.679
actually have a real face to-face group

5490.04 --> 5494.88
of

5491.679 --> 5498.6
people a place to

5494.88 --> 5498.6
belong the Church of

5507.88 --> 5513.76
globe hello Els G good to see

5510.76 --> 5513.76
you

5531.76 --> 5536.84
not applicable to Joe public or private

5534.679 --> 5538.679
citizen just Army G what are you talking

5536.84 --> 5542.56
about low

5538.679 --> 5545.6
fruit what what is no no no no Globe

5542.56 --> 5549.2390000000005
religion would be like

5545.6 --> 5549.2390000000005
churches right just like

5549.8 --> 5555.639
Christianity like you can literally just

5552.28 --> 5557.719
say like this is the Church of the

5555.639 --> 5560.6
globe come

5557.719 --> 5563.28
here we can have a party like why

5560.6 --> 5566.52
wouldn't you say like yeah we get over

5563.28 --> 5569.84
here everybody gets uh there's beers or

5566.52 --> 5572.6
something right I mean it's not like God

5569.84 --> 5574.56
would object to that

5572.6 --> 5577.639
the point is you could just have party

5574.56 --> 5580.719
places basically that would be tax

5577.639 --> 5580.719
exempt because it's a

5583.679 --> 5587.92
religion right and they could e

5590.639 --> 5596.719
yeah you just have like like this

5593.84 --> 5599.04
widespread amount of globe religious

5596.719 --> 5601.639
people with their own Globe church that

5599.04 --> 5603.32
will have differences and bickering and

5601.639 --> 5605.159000000001
among each other and there like oh don't

5603.32 --> 5607.239
go to that Globe church he doesn't

5605.159 --> 5609.839999999999
really get it he doesn't understand how

5607.239 --> 5612.48
it really works right you'd get that

5609.84 --> 5615.88
[ __ ] too I mean just like with

5612.48 --> 5615.879999999999
Christianity all these

5620.84 --> 5625.159000000001
churches most churches and religious yes

5623.48 --> 5628.839999999999
I know low

5625.159 --> 5628.839999999999
fruit but that was the

5630.56 --> 5635.6
point if the globe is a church now all

5633.719 --> 5637.52
these people that were like we don't

5635.6 --> 5641.4400000000005
want to have anything to do with that

5637.52 --> 5643.639
religion with God and all that

5641.44 --> 5646.159
well they

5643.639 --> 5649.159000000001
probably wouldn't mind having those

5646.159 --> 5653.839999999999
opportunities tax breaks opportunities

5649.159 --> 5656.839999999999
to match just like ha now we get that

5653.84 --> 5656.84
Advantage

5660.48 --> 5663.48
right

5664.36 --> 5669.679
and dude like don't worry they'll still

5667.0 --> 5671.96
be super double speaking I mean once

5669.679 --> 5673.88
they get the globe Church in debates

5671.96 --> 5676.0
they would still deny that the globe is

5673.88 --> 5679.159000000001
a religion even though it would be

5676.0 --> 5681.84
officially recognized legally as a

5679.159 --> 5683.759999999999
religion and they would get tax breaks

5681.84 --> 5685.119000000001
because it being a religion they would

5683.76 --> 5687.280000000001
still in

5685.119 --> 5689.04
arguments like with a flat earther or

5687.28 --> 5692.44
something

5689.04 --> 5696.159
or a god believer they would still deny

5692.44 --> 5698.32
that they were a religion yeah I mean

5696.159 --> 5701.199
don't kid

5698.32 --> 5704.159
yourself

5701.199 --> 5706.239
right they will like legally accept

5704.159 --> 5708.879999999999
religion status but they would never

5706.239 --> 5711.08
actually admit that it's a

5708.88 --> 5714.36
religion we we're still talking about

5711.08 --> 5714.36
glob Believers here

5717.97 --> 5723.2390000000005
[Music]

5720.0 --> 5725.52
okay I mean

5723.239 --> 5728.159
what you think they wouldn't be

5725.52 --> 5731.1990000000005
Hypocrites about it of course they

5728.159 --> 5733.92
would they take they'd be officially

5731.199 --> 5736.599999999999
declared a religion legally they'd get

5733.92 --> 5738.679
religious tax breaks over it but in a

5736.6 --> 5741.08
debate they would never actually admit

5738.679 --> 5743.84
to being a religion they just get the

5741.08 --> 5747.32
benefits from it they're not actually

5743.84 --> 5750.400000000001
going to intellectually admit it why do

5747.32 --> 5754.48
you think they are

5750.4 --> 5754.48
honest good luck with

5756.84 --> 5762.0
that what kind of cool hats would you

5759.199 --> 5762.0
have their priest

5762.4 --> 5769.159
wear uh ball hats with flat

5769.48 --> 5777.5199999999995
tops so kind of like the the the same

5773.52 --> 5777.52
hats that graduates get

5778.32 --> 5784.44
right like a a little ball half a ball

5781.52 --> 5787.280000000001
on your head with like the flat top of

5784.44 --> 5787.28
course that would be

5797.26 --> 5802.97
[Music]

5806.43 --> 5811.400000000001
[Music]

5808.28 --> 5813.679
it not sure the best ofs get the same

5811.4 --> 5813.679
that

5815.88 --> 5822.28
bre I don't know either L fruit but I

5819.48 --> 5825.159
mean pastafarianism is not like a state

5822.28 --> 5825.159
religion that's the

5825.36 --> 5832.32
point if the state declares and legally

5829.199 --> 5834.599999999999
arranges the ball to be the state

5832.32 --> 5837.28
religion an official

5834.6 --> 5839.159000000001
religion then yeah they do get it

5837.28 --> 5840.199
because literally it's the state that's

5839.159 --> 5843.199
doing

5840.199 --> 5843.199
that

5844.84 --> 5851.96
pastafarianism is like a a Grassroots

5849.48 --> 5856.119
atheist religion group but I mean it's

5851.96 --> 5859.44
kind of mockery but not really serious I

5856.119 --> 5863.239
think it was to make a

5859.44 --> 5867.5199999999995
point and then weirdly enough it became

5863.239 --> 5870.36
literal I don't know it's weird past

5867.52 --> 5873.76
fism but if the state just literally

5870.36 --> 5873.759999999999
backs up some

5873.84 --> 5877.8
religion yeah You' get all the tax break

5876.32 --> 5882.719
because it's literally the state that

5877.8 --> 5882.719
just says yes yes you can definitely do

5887.199 --> 5892.199
that the globe will become a religion

5889.679 --> 5895.4
when Flat Earth slips in the

5892.199 --> 5898.638999999999
curriculum W that's a very interesting

5895.4 --> 5903.119
thing for you to say zap

5898.639 --> 5903.119
tappy I agree

5908.199 --> 5912.32
government would never give tax breaks

5909.8 --> 5916.28
for such a silly

5912.32 --> 5921.04
idea unless it's officially the

5916.28 --> 5921.04
government religion normal

5930.119 --> 5933.119
Norman

5936.04 --> 5940.199
no akumu virus you got that completely

5943.28 --> 5949.4
wrong oh wait Ruster yeah I thought you

5947.32 --> 5952.88
said

5949.4 --> 5954.638999999999
pastafarians but yeah rest aarian ism is

5952.88 --> 5957.04
sort of like

5954.639 --> 5958.96
Christianity it's not a different Jesus

5957.04 --> 5962.28
though although they think it's like

5958.96 --> 5965.32
Ethiopian or something I'm not sure

5962.28 --> 5968.96
the point is is it's like

5965.32 --> 5973.719
a yeah another form of Christianity just

5968.96 --> 5977.52
like the uh what's it again

5973.719 --> 5981.96
U Ethiopian Christianity right it's also

5977.52 --> 5981.96
like its own form much closer to

5982.48 --> 5989.04
like like more full-blown like

5986.04 --> 5989.04
Catholicism

5990.04 --> 5994.8
religion

5992.52 --> 5998.92
well rust aarian ism is much more like a

5994.8 --> 6000.96
folk religion in that sense they don't

5998.92 --> 6003.76
really have like official churches or

6000.96 --> 6006.08
anything do they I don't know actually

6003.76 --> 6009.0
do do there are there like rest aarian

6006.08 --> 6012.36
churches I have no

6009.0 --> 6014.96
idea don't they just blaze weed yeah

6012.36 --> 6014.96
that's part of

6015.639 --> 6022.96
it I Le Cassi yeah yeah I remember

6019.96 --> 6022.96
that

6028.32 --> 6031.239
do no

6034.239 --> 6039.959999999999
pastafarianism they is a mock religion

6037.08 --> 6042.159
that says that the Universe was created

6039.96 --> 6046.2390000000005
by a giant pasta

6042.159 --> 6049.92
monster instead of God that's it yeah I

6046.239 --> 6052.919999999999
know it sounds really lame because it

6049.92 --> 6052.92
is

6080.199 --> 6082.839999999999
right

6094.639 --> 6099.84
I mean pastafarianism is like the

6097.239 --> 6102.879999999999
ultimate it was really like the ultimate

6099.84 --> 6105.0
90s hipster

6102.88 --> 6107.8
religion

6105.0 --> 6110.199
right I mean you'd have to be like

6107.8 --> 6113.52
pretty hipsterish to even know what the

6110.199 --> 6117.239
[ __ ] past arianism

6113.52 --> 6117.2390000000005
was cuz it's so

6120.4 --> 6127.48
stupid it's it was like a hipster

6123.159 --> 6127.48
religion it still is there I

6139.76 --> 6142.76
think

6144.0 --> 6148.48
boy you're what the hell are you talking

6146.719 --> 6151.4800000000005
about

6148.48 --> 6151.48
elsi

6169.76 --> 6173.360000000001
what

6171.28 --> 6174.88
what Richard you think that

6173.36 --> 6177.799999999999
pastafarianism

6174.88 --> 6180.400000000001
was specifically to Mar

6177.8 --> 6183.28
rastafarianism that's

6180.4 --> 6185.199
weird why do you say that I mean just

6183.28 --> 6188.0
because the name is

6185.199 --> 6190.5199999999995
similar doesn't mean that's a specific

6188.0 --> 6190.52
dig at

6199.679 --> 6202.679
them

6223.8 --> 6228.360000000001
and like besides why why would they dig

6226.119 --> 6230.639
after rust aarian ISM I don't think that

6228.36 --> 6232.79
rust aarian ISM even gets like full Rec

6230.639 --> 6234.0
recognition for being a form of chisti

6232.79 --> 6237.04
[Music]

6234.0 --> 6241.199
enity so like what what's the point of

6237.04 --> 6244.159
doing a dig after at them

6241.199 --> 6248.199
specifically I think it's just the name

6244.159 --> 6252.5199999999995

6344.159 --> 6351.36
dumb make your brain dumb but that yeah

6348.36 --> 6353.5599999999995
the movie was stupid I'm talking about

6351.36 --> 6355.32
the cartoon the Saturday morning cartoon

6353.56 --> 6357.719
where they also had

6355.32 --> 6359.8099999999995
liveaction skits in between that were

6357.719 --> 6362.0
really

6359.81 --> 6367.2390000000005
[Music]

6362.0 --> 6370.239
silly with the Mario rap the

6367.239 --> 6371.718999999999
Mario I don't know I used to think it

6370.239 --> 6375.4
was awesome as a

6371.719 --> 6375.4
kid but it's really

6379.4 --> 6382.4
silly

6394.0 --> 6398.52
let me see if I can find

6395.47 --> 6398.52
[Music]

6401.18 --> 6406.09
[Music]

6409.4 --> 6414.009999999999
this

6411.199 --> 6417.0689999999995
let's see if this

6414.01 --> 6417.069
[Music]

6420.719 --> 6426.96
works yeah I got to share you this this

6423.639 --> 6429.2390000000005
is like one of those weird

6426.96 --> 6431.719
memes it's all over the internet but

6429.239 --> 6435.119
this is like one of the main memes what

6431.719 --> 6438.76
that cartoon shows is about now come on

6435.119 --> 6442.32
man what the [ __ ] is that it's not a

6438.76 --> 6442.320000000001
[ __ ] link

6446.44 --> 6451.4
[ __ ] it's like yeah I'm copying the

6449.08 --> 6455.04
link that doesn't mean I want your

6451.4 --> 6456.44
expanded Google garbage link that means

6455.04 --> 6459.719
the

6456.44 --> 6461.919999999999
link nobody ever wants to join Google

6459.719 --> 6464.76
garbage links

6461.92 --> 6469.119
anyway you might recognize

6464.76 --> 6469.119000000001
this but this is like a very

6469.32 --> 6476.5199999999995
memish so everybody that's ever heard of

6472.32 --> 6480.5599999999995
that series will use this clip very

6476.52 --> 6480.56
typically because he said

6482.96 --> 6488.76
that that actor from Mario Brothers was

6486.32 --> 6488.759999999999
super

6490.159 --> 6493.159
anti-drugs

6499.239 --> 6502.239
anyway

6504.56 --> 6509.280000000001
how the hell did I get oh yeah you were

6506.0 --> 6509.28
talking about pasta

6520.56 --> 6524.280000000001
pastafarianism I know right

6529.199 --> 6532.199
richardy

6535.29 --> 6538.399
[Music]

6556.04 --> 6562.64
bu the fairin have fili hair what

6561.32 --> 6565.759
what are you talking

6562.64 --> 6565.759
[Music]

6566.4 --> 6571.879999999999
about

6568.119 --> 6571.88
oh yeah

6573.32 --> 6579.719
what that is

6576.8 --> 6582.570000000001
just that is so silly seeking

6579.719 --> 6585.649
starwater hilarious

6582.57 --> 6585.648999999999
[Music]

6587.199 --> 6592.678999999999
though go to hell before you yeah he

6589.76 --> 6595.0
said that that that's right before which

6592.679 --> 6598.0
makes it excellent

6595.0 --> 6598.0
because

6599.32 --> 6605.199
yeah in my opinion hell is mostly

6602.48 --> 6607.4
experienced during

6605.199 --> 6610.239
life not after

6607.4 --> 6612.36
it I mean you get confronted with

6610.239 --> 6615.199
whatever you've especially tried to

6612.36 --> 6618.679
forget or like

6615.199 --> 6620.4
downplay what you forgot that was evil

6618.679 --> 6623.4800000000005
that you're responsible for that kind of

6620.4 --> 6626.04
thing but like most of the actual

6623.48 --> 6629.119
anguish I believe that we actually

6626.04 --> 6631.44
experience during life that that is the

6629.119 --> 6634.598999999999
hell that we experience and if you have

6631.44 --> 6635.839999999999
a lot of hell like for the wrong reasons

6634.599 --> 6639.2390000000005
or you

6635.84 --> 6641.639
like if you're not willing to take God's

6639.239 --> 6644.239
punishment or test or however you're

6641.639 --> 6647.04
going to see that then you might face

6644.239 --> 6649.598999999999
that after death in a

6647.04 --> 6652.0
sense but I thought it was just extra

6649.599 --> 6655.92
amazing that he says you go to hell

6652.0 --> 6657.96
before you die because that's actually a

6655.92 --> 6660.92
better way to say

6657.96 --> 6662.84
it still very weird that he says it

6660.92 --> 6665.52
though in a cartoon that's really meant

6662.84 --> 6665.52
for kids

6673.48 --> 6677.28
[Music]

6678.96 --> 6684.719
but

6681.44 --> 6684.719
very true indeed oh

6685.679 --> 6692.32
[ __ ] did you die

6689.0 --> 6693.06
Richard no but I mean that does kind of

6692.32 --> 6696.169
sound like

6693.06 --> 6696.169000000001
[Music]

6698.48 --> 6702.919999999999
that like don't do drugs you'll go to

6701.239 --> 6708.919999999999
hell before you

6702.92 --> 6708.92
die very true indeed coming from my

6708.96 --> 6711.96
experience

6715.8 --> 6724.079000000001
unless you literally saw other people

6719.0 --> 6724.079
have that then it then it makes

6733.84 --> 6741.88
sense Gateway truck means something

6738.88 --> 6746.0
different yeah a gateway drug is just

6741.88 --> 6748.400000000001
it's an you did oh okay that's messed up

6746.0 --> 6748.4
rich

6748.599 --> 6753.360000000001
G that dude doesn't do a lot of

6753.56 --> 6760.1990000000005
[Music]

6755.0 --> 6763.119
mushrooms oh El oh oh

6760.199 --> 6766.04
oh yeah I'm yeah he's not going to be

6763.119 --> 6766.04
able to robot

6768.84 --> 6771.84
that

6788.96 --> 6792.119
no but what a gateway drug really is is

6791.28 --> 6796.759999999999
a

6792.119 --> 6799.159
drug what the real Gateway effect is is

6796.76 --> 6802.280000000001
that a lot of people that don't take

6799.159 --> 6804.079
drugs are afraid of it they're afraid

6802.28 --> 6806.04
that they if they will take drugs that

6804.079 --> 6810.4
it will change them and that they'll

6806.04 --> 6814.239
become addicted to it and lose who they

6810.4 --> 6817.199
were a gateway drug what makes it a

6814.239 --> 6820.799999999999
gateway drug is that you specifically

6817.199 --> 6823.36
lose that fear a gateway drug makes you

6820.8 --> 6824.56
like oh wait I guess drugs aren't all

6823.36 --> 6826.88
that

6824.56 --> 6829.4800000000005
bad and that's really what makes it a

6826.88 --> 6832.8
Gateway druck because then it opens your

6829.48 --> 6836.04
mind that you might try out other things

6832.8 --> 6839.96
see that's the Gateway

6836.04 --> 6842.239
aspect is that it takes away your fear

6839.96 --> 6842.2390000000005
of

6842.4 --> 6848.598999999999
drugs alcohol is the gate well there you

6845.52 --> 6851.52
go that's right because what does

6848.599 --> 6853.4400000000005
alcohol do it takes away inhibitions it

6851.52 --> 6857.4800000000005
takes away your fear so it is the

6853.44 --> 6861.44
ultimate gateway drug alcohol really is

6857.48 --> 6864.678999999999
yet it's legal most countries how crazy

6861.44 --> 6864.678999999999
is that

6866.96 --> 6873.159
right but on the other hand yeah I

6870.159 --> 6875.5599999999995
mean I'm not like for a complete alcohol

6873.159 --> 6878.28
ban or anything but I definitely think

6875.56 --> 6880.92
it shouldn't be allowed to be

6878.28 --> 6884.159
advertised

6880.92 --> 6886.1990000000005
yeah I think it's like very equal

6884.159 --> 6888.96
footing to

6886.199 --> 6891.5599999999995
Tobacco like I don't want to see tobacco

6888.96 --> 6894.28
advertisement don't want to see alcohol

6891.56 --> 6897.639
advertisements but I definitely would

6894.28 --> 6901.759999999999
think it's it should it's better if they

6897.639 --> 6904.159000000001
should be available for people to

6901.76 --> 6906.719
get I just don't want to have it pushed

6904.159 --> 6911.079
in my face I don't want to have it

6906.719 --> 6911.079
grafted into some kind of like popular

6912.0 --> 6915.56
culture and the same goes for cannabis

6914.44 --> 6918.638999999999
by the

6915.56 --> 6920.159000000001
way I mean sure the cannabis convention

6918.639 --> 6923.639
that sort of [ __ ]

6920.159 --> 6925.638999999999
but I mean it that's still like Club

6923.639 --> 6929.1990000000005
it's like a club like you into that you

6925.639 --> 6931.679
can go there it shouldn't be like oh the

6929.199 --> 6934.32
Cannabis Festival everywhere and on the

6931.679 --> 6936.96
television and no no no it's

6934.32 --> 6941.48
like it's for the fans of

6936.96 --> 6941.4800000000005
it cannabis should definitely not be

6942.36 --> 6948.44
advertised but neither

6945.04 --> 6950.84
should tobacco and alcohol well the

6948.44 --> 6953.5599999999995
tobacco I I mean that's all just getting

6950.84 --> 6957.679
pushed out and forbidden

6953.56 --> 6959.84
and tax the hell out of it crazy

6957.679 --> 6963.88
[ __ ] and for

6959.84 --> 6967.28
what I mean I think that by now we can

6963.88 --> 6969.32
like statistically prove that there's a

6967.28 --> 6974.44
lot more people that

6969.32 --> 6976.84
suffer medical damages and or death

6974.44 --> 6978.5199999999995
because of alcohol than from

6976.84 --> 6981.52
tobacco

6978.52 --> 6981.52
statistically

6984.04 --> 6990.76
yeah but Alco ads are still pop

6987.56 --> 6995.52
up they even like at the side of the

6990.76 --> 6998.719
road oh drink a beer at a [ __ ] side

6995.52 --> 7002.2390000000005
the road sign like what the [ __ ] is

6998.719 --> 7005.2390000000005
this that's just wrong it shouldn't be

7002.239 --> 7008.48
it shouldn't be allowed in my

7005.239 --> 7011.48
opinion let it exist but don't advertise

7008.48 --> 7011.48
it

7020.079 --> 7024.04
Al can get bad alcohol withdrawal can

7021.92 --> 7027.32
kill you yeah if you completely make

7024.04 --> 7027.32
yourself dependent on that

7027.62 --> 7033.719
[Music]

7029.44 --> 7037.199
[ __ ] the point is alcohol is provably a

7033.719 --> 7041.28
gateway drug and it should not

7037.199 --> 7042.44
be advertised it's really dangerous to

7041.28 --> 7045.4
do

7042.44 --> 7047.799999999999
that people shouldn't be pushed to like

7045.4 --> 7050.638999999999
yeah get that drink they shouldn't

7047.8 --> 7053.1990000000005
happen it's

7050.639 --> 7057.079
bad it's

7053.199 --> 7060.04
disruptive it's bad for the economy

7057.079 --> 7061.599
there I say although yeah there might be

7060.04 --> 7064.5199999999995
different interpretations for that

7061.599 --> 7067.04
because oh you might spend more

7064.52 --> 7071.079000000001
easily yeah and basically [ __ ] up your

7067.04 --> 7074.44
plans also so yeah whatever point is

7071.079 --> 7077.28
it's provably a gateway drug there's

7074.44 --> 7079.879999999999
more damage caused by alcohol

7077.28 --> 7082.239
consumption than tobacco consumption I

7079.88 --> 7084.2390000000005
bet

7082.239 --> 7088.4
statistically I mean alcohol is

7084.239 --> 7090.28
considered a hard drug for a good reason

7088.4 --> 7093.159
anyway so

7090.28 --> 7096.5199999999995
yeah I'm going to round out it's been a

7093.159 --> 7099.839999999999
