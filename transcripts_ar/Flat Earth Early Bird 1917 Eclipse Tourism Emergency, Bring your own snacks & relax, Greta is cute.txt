it's kind of funny the the blue in in

155.959 --> 162.4
the

157.76 --> 164.92
sky kind of meets the same blue of the

162.4 --> 168.48000000000002
the CGI background of my

164.92 --> 170.159
show it's kind of the same blue isn't

168.48 --> 174.0
it

170.159 --> 174.0

188.28 --> 197.4
right hello jog first in

191.64 --> 197.39999999999998
chat it is Sunday the 7th of April

201.64 --> 206.51899999999998
20124 tomorrow the big

204.4 --> 211.76000000000002
day well

206.519 --> 211.76
it's it is a big day I guess

219.12 --> 224.959
wouldn't really anticipate too I mean

222.04 --> 226.67999999999998
it's the day of an eclipse it's going to

224.959 --> 229.36
be interesting I don't really think

226.68 --> 234.0
there's going to be anything spectacular

229.36 --> 234.0
happening to be fair other than the

238.72 --> 242.519
eclipse

240.36 --> 246.31900000000002
I mean there seems to be plenty of

242.519 --> 249.079
things that are happening around this

246.319 --> 251.11999999999998
time I don't think like oh the clips is

249.079 --> 253.20000000000002
coming and then immediately something

251.12 --> 254.76
terrible happened or whatever like that

253.2 --> 257.68
I don't think that's going to be the

254.76 --> 258.959
case at all J wouldn't worry too much

257.68 --> 263.199
about

258.959 --> 265.76
it right remember don't be

263.199 --> 268.72
afraid don't get carried

265.76 --> 271.71999999999997
[Music]

268.72 --> 271.72
away

292.12 --> 298.039
there's some reports that they're

295.479 --> 300.24
officially

298.039 --> 303.68
starting Geo

300.24 --> 306.479
engineering Pro a geoengineering project

303.68 --> 310.639
in San Francisco

306.479 --> 314.039
now making clouds to block the

310.639 --> 316.639
sun oh that they just started doing that

314.039 --> 320.52
oh it's so controversial it's not like

316.639 --> 322.84000000000003
they've been just standard doing that

320.52 --> 322.84
since

324.36 --> 331.639
1995 but

326.88 --> 331.639
uh they're now doing that officially

337.68 --> 341.0
making clouds oh

352.6 --> 361.199
well right Al not so good development in

358.319 --> 365.6
Brazil it's turning

361.199 --> 368.91900000000004
more WF over there through the the

365.6 --> 368.91900000000004
courts which is not

369.319 --> 375.199
nice

372.12 --> 377.72
anyway right it is Sunday the 7th of

375.199 --> 377.72
April

380.72 --> 390.84000000000003
2024 temperature

383.639 --> 394.96000000000004
is 21° c h it says clouded right

390.84 --> 394.96
right pretty sure it's sunny

396.639 --> 402.28000000000003
outside so it's definitely warmer than

399.319 --> 402.28000000000003
they predicted it would

403.4 --> 410.52
[Music]

407.96 --> 413.039
be and it seems like Monday is also

410.52 --> 415.19899999999996
going to be a bit warmer and there's a

413.039 --> 418.56
forecast for next weekend on Saturday

415.199 --> 420.199
it's going to be 20° as well so we'll

418.56 --> 422.16
see I think it's going to be a pretty

420.199 --> 425.879
warm week actually

422.16 --> 425.879
overall which is kind of

429.479 --> 437.84
nice I'm thinking I should

432.8 --> 437.84000000000003
really I need a a new white

439.08 --> 445.0
shirt all the white shirts I got are not

442.4 --> 447.0
exactly white anymore or they have so

445.0 --> 448.52
many holes in them you can barely call

447.0 --> 451.08
it a shirt

448.52 --> 453.87899999999996
anymore

451.08 --> 458.84
but yeah I don't exactly have the

453.879 --> 460.96000000000004
budget to spare for that kind of

458.84 --> 463.31899999999996
expenditures so I might have to wait

460.96 --> 463.31899999999996
until

469.039 --> 474.52
May unless somebody gives me a surprise

471.919 --> 476.79999999999995
donation and then I might be able to get

474.52 --> 480.0
get it

476.8 --> 482.919
anyhow hope everybody's doing well

480.0 --> 487.319
I had a bit of a rough

482.919 --> 490.87899999999996
night was kind of hard getting to

487.319 --> 495.08000000000004
sleep cuz it was so stormy at at in the

490.879 --> 497.8
night as well and roommate was I think

495.08 --> 500.96
I'm like cam mean again just stumbling

497.8 --> 506.0
making enormous amounts of

500.96 --> 508.44
noise so yeah not had the best to

506.0 --> 511.44
sleep but I am

508.44 --> 511.44
here

512.08 --> 516.719
let's hope that just the nice weather is

513.839 --> 516.719
going to make up for

517.52 --> 522.11
[Music]

528.48 --> 535.16
it I'm wearing my uh the sun is a

532.0 --> 535.16
non-local hologram

535.48 --> 540.88
shirt thought it was nice to put that on

539.04 --> 543.519
for a

540.88 --> 547.2
change I think the other shirt also like

543.519 --> 549.279
I I probably just need to wash it I've

547.2 --> 550.72
been wearing that under my sweater for a

549.279 --> 553.72
long

550.72 --> 553.72
time

562.04 --> 565.04
uh

568.36 --> 571.36
right

573.92 --> 577.1999999999999
so what's going on out

598.32 --> 601.32
there

613.24 --> 618.399
I noticed there was

615.399 --> 618.399
another

623.519 --> 628.8
what there another archaic video about

626.839 --> 630.839
the moon but I think it's probably

628.8 --> 633.1999999999999
mostly even nons since I didn't actually

630.839 --> 633.2
check it

650.24 --> 654.92
out I'm flicking through it at least it

653.04 --> 658.56
it doesn't seem to be about some

654.92 --> 661.24
heliocentric based claim that that's

658.56 --> 661.2399999999999
something I guess

676.12 --> 681.24
yes you're going camping deep in the

678.56 --> 681.2399999999999
woods all

681.279 --> 686.0
right going to get away from

684.2 --> 687.839
civilization here

686.0 --> 690.24
something

687.839 --> 693.2
what okay

690.24 --> 695.76
dog I mean I really wouldn't worry that

693.2 --> 695.76
much about

702.76 --> 708.56
it I mean I really don't think anything

705.68 --> 711.519
like that

708.56 --> 715.079
like there's not going to be some kind

711.519 --> 718.0
of thing that's going to roll out during

715.079 --> 721.2399999999999
the eclipse dude you don't don't be

718.0 --> 721.24
afraid man

724.639 --> 730.839
I mean if you just wanted to get some

726.639 --> 733.76
peace and quiet anyway then

730.839 --> 737.1600000000001
sure go out in the middle of

733.76 --> 739.72
nowhere but don't do it because you're

737.16 --> 744.04
afraid something is going to happen it's

739.72 --> 744.0400000000001
just going to make you feel stupid

746.16 --> 749.88
afterward just do it to go out and enjoy

748.92 --> 753.199
nature

749.88 --> 753.199
with some peace and quiet or

756.81 --> 760.06
[Music]

761.519 --> 766.639
something I mean like the worst that I

764.48 --> 771.0
that I anticipate that could happen is

766.639 --> 771.0
like some weird unexpected earthquake or

772.16 --> 775.48
something that's

778.12 --> 781.12
it

781.72 --> 786.8000000000001
that there was an earthquake in New York

787.639 --> 793.88
recently so yeah something like that

791.24 --> 796.399
might happen but I mean other than

793.88 --> 798.279
that I mean nobody's going to do

796.399 --> 801.76
anything

798.279 --> 803.56
like I even tried to like in when I did

801.76 --> 807.48
my shows about

803.56 --> 811.1199999999999
the the N Eclipse like nothing is going

807.48 --> 811.12
to happen on the day

811.48 --> 817.44
it's an energy thing and it is a

814.44 --> 817.44
calendar

822.92 --> 827.88
thing like people's minds might change

825.839 --> 829.1600000000001
but that doesn't mean that like some big

827.88 --> 832.26
thing is going to

829.16 --> 832.26
[Music]

838.04 --> 841.04
unroll

841.16 --> 846.48
like not on the day itself at least I

843.639 --> 846.48
mean that's just

850.16 --> 855.12
ridiculous you enjoy camping anyway

852.759 --> 857.16
right well then then just do it for that

855.12 --> 860.519
like

857.16 --> 864.12
don't don't go and do it with any kind

860.519 --> 868.04
of fear in your heart just go out and

864.12 --> 871.04
just enjoy yourself don't be

868.04 --> 871.04

927.319 --> 933.4399999999999
year sometimes twice or three times a

933.44 --> 938.9590000000001
get carried away by that don't get

936.0 --> 938.959
carried away with the

943.6 --> 947.24
fear or they

947.279 --> 954.0

951.839 --> 957.639
addicts and I mean there's plenty of

954.0 --> 957.639

1032.4 --> 1035.919
whatever for you

1036.199 --> 1039.199

1071.0 --> 1073.72
absolutely

1077.84 --> 1080.84
gorgeous

1084.559 --> 1088.9189999999999
just a couple of fluffy little clouds

1086.6 --> 1090.559
and a lot of blue

1088.919 --> 1094.24
sky

1090.559 --> 1096.9189999999999
and no trails that I can

1094.24 --> 1099.48
see and I bet that if they're getting

1096.919 --> 1103.0800000000002
sprayed up there that the wind is just

1099.48 --> 1106.32
going to quickly blow them

1103.08 --> 1107.76
apart cuz there is pretty strong wind

1106.32 --> 1109.6399999999999
out

1107.76 --> 1111.24
there

1109.64 --> 1114.6000000000001
which is

1111.24 --> 1116.799
great I mean all the blossoming stuff

1114.6 --> 1121.48
out there that requires

1116.799 --> 1121.48
wind is yeah it's going to have a good

1122.679 --> 1127.039
pollination and the wind is nice and

1124.88 --> 1130.7990000000002
warm so it's just enjoyable it's not

1127.039 --> 1133.1589999999999
cold it's not too hot it's just great

1130.799 --> 1136.0
this weather is like absolutely

1133.159 --> 1136.0
excellent for

1136.039 --> 1143.1589999999999
just having a walk outside and like

1140.48 --> 1146.6
maybe going into a forest or just having

1143.159 --> 1149.159
a picnic somewhere in a field it's it's

1146.6 --> 1151.28
brilliant weather and I'm really

1149.159 --> 1154.24
surprised that I'm not seeing a lot more

1151.28 --> 1154.24
people just going

1154.76 --> 1161.0
around walking outside yesterday was all

1158.4 --> 1164.4
crowded maybe it's the wind that people

1161.0 --> 1167.72
are a bit hesitant to do it but I mean

1164.4 --> 1170.72
even the wind is just nice and

1167.72 --> 1170.72
warm

1173.039 --> 1179.4
right fear is gay oh duper I didn't know

true Sun worshippers like the fear

1197.64 --> 1200.64
mongering

1201.559 --> 1205.9189999999999
is it though is it fear worshiping or is

like go on a date with her and kind of

1406.96 --> 1410.799
change her mind in ways but I probably

mean Greta thunberg Greg runel that's

2198.52 --> 2204.359
way way out of my leak way out of my

she's the biggest aw on the planet well

mean she keeps her normal hair

2246.52 --> 2252.44
color

2248.96 --> 2256.8
I mean she's a a natural activist she's

2252.44 --> 2259.8

problem

2261.8 --> 2267.48
right I don't know what the hell it is I

2264.4 --> 2271.319
just feel like she's not Beyond

2267.48 --> 2271.319
correcting like she could be

2271.839 --> 2278.599
corrected it like it's not bad when a

2275.56 --> 2280.68
person is really passionate for nature

2278.599 --> 2282.599
it's just kind of tragic when they're

2280.68 --> 2285.72
really

2282.599 --> 2288.7200000000003
misled yeah J exactly I can change her I

2285.72 --> 2291.9599999999996
could do it I could turn her to the good

2288.72 --> 2294.9599999999996
side sort of maybe probably not it's

2291.96 --> 2294.96
just something that I

2296.359 --> 2302.52
feel she's a

2298.68 --> 2306.0789999999997
glober well you might be

2302.52 --> 2312.52
surprised a lot of these types they're

2306.079 --> 2312.52
really openm about alternative things at

2316.319 --> 2321.64
climate change models and all that are

2319.4 --> 2324.48
based on Globe

2321.64 --> 2326.8799999999997

[Music]

2336.44 --> 2339.44
that

2344.28 --> 2350.3190000000004
right but I mean if look if Greta would

2347.76 --> 2354.76
ever

2350.319 --> 2358.0
like color her hair green or pink it

2354.76 --> 2361.079
would be over for me though like that is

2358.0 --> 2361.079
that is a step too

2362.16 --> 2366.359
far but I just I don't think she's going

weird and risky during the eclipse I

2637.24 --> 2643.2799999999997
mean that's like the extent of my tip

2640.4 --> 2643.28
tips for it like

2643.839 --> 2650.0
that like don't pick any wild flowers

2647.76 --> 2652.88
and just eat them or something during

2650.0 --> 2656.079
the eclipse but other than that like

2652.88 --> 2656.079
everything should just be

how does the Umbra and penumbra

I mean the Umbra penumbra Shadow they

3239.72 --> 3245.799
just make a ton of

3242.079 --> 3247.52
sense right all you need to do is just

3245.799 --> 3249.559
have a little

3247.52 --> 3253.119

3253.119 --> 3258.359
times further away and then have that

3255.72 --> 3260.359
little ball shine onto another little

3258.359 --> 3263.48
ball and it's going to give an umbre P

3260.359 --> 3265.799

3263.48 --> 3270.2
got to happen right that that's how that

3265.799 --> 3272.839
happens right I ah ah no it doesn't no

it [ __ ]

it no object CA the shadow smaller than

3295.28 --> 3301.6400000000003
itself yeah but it's like it's the idea

3298.839 --> 3304.48
is that the sun is like shining because

3301.64 --> 3308.8799999999997
it's bigger it's shining from the sides

3304.48 --> 3312.68
it's the problem is it just doesn't

3308.88 --> 3318.0
work how does it work then

3312.68 --> 3320.9199999999996
well one non-local holographic angular

3318.0 --> 3325.16
manifestation moves over and arguably

3320.92 --> 3328.52
cancels out part of another non-local

3325.16 --> 3332.44
angular manifest station

3328.52 --> 3336.64

3332.44 --> 3340.52
and how the hell should I know how that

3336.64 --> 3344.2
works there are definitely not objects

3340.52 --> 3346.599
Shining Light at a distance and being

3344.2 --> 3350.72
blocked by another object that's casting

3346.599 --> 3350.7200000000003

extremely

3390.4 --> 3393.4
bright

3398.799 --> 3406.319
yeah that look I'm not saying that an

3402.28 --> 3408.44
eclipse can't be seen that we don't see

3406.319 --> 3412.079
those things that we see we definitely

3408.44 --> 3415.92
see them I'm just saying like it's

3412.079 --> 3416.799
not explicable you can't explain why it

3415.92 --> 3417.6800000000003
looks

3416.799 --> 3421.88
like

3417.68 --> 3425.64
that using heliocentric

3421.88 --> 3429.839
cosmology I mean they have an excuse for

3425.64 --> 3434.0
it they made up something to tell

3429.839 --> 3436.0389999999998
you right just like how they make up

3434.0 --> 3438.359
like oh yeah we don't actually see stars

3436.039 --> 3442.2400000000002
up there in space we only see them down

3438.359 --> 3445.24
here because the air just like it

3442.24 --> 3447.24
somehow amplifies The Starlight so that

3445.24 --> 3449.3999999999996
you can see stars again at the ground

3447.24 --> 3452.72

3449.4 --> 3456.6800000000003
make up a dumb excuse story it's what

3452.72 --> 3458.5989999999997
they do it doesn't make sense it doesn't

3456.68 --> 3462.16
have to make sense it just has to be

3458.599 --> 3465.119
something that they can say to quickly

3462.16 --> 3467.0789999999997
move over any questions so that the

3465.119 --> 3469.48
people asking those questions will get

3467.079 --> 3470.6400000000003
that feeling like oh okay they got an

3469.48 --> 3472.119
explanation for that they know what

3470.64 --> 3474.96
they're talking

3472.119 --> 3476.96
about yeah they don't have to understand

3474.96 --> 3478.599
it they just have to have that feeling

like oh yeah yeah they know what what

3478.599 --> 3481.3590000000004
they're talking about yeah that's what

3480.44 --> 3484.319
that's

3481.359 --> 3486.72
about not about it actually making any

3484.319 --> 3486.72

don't fully understand how they got it

3552.48 --> 3558.48
in such

3554.2 --> 3561.72
detail stellarium shows it's the Moon

3558.48 --> 3561.72
yes of course it

3562.4 --> 3568.839
is it's just that Moon that's completely

thanks for the 5 Hour what uh we'll see

3626.359 --> 3633.44
about that it's going to require a

3630.16 --> 3636.3999999999996
couple of super chats if you really want

3633.44 --> 3639.0
to no I'm not going to do 5 hours sorry

3636.4 --> 3643.44
I just it's too much I'm not going to

3639.0 --> 3647.039
keep going till like 7

3643.44 --> 3649.2400000000002
o'clock it's a bit much right I am going

3668.21 --> 3671.389
[Music]

3685.599 --> 3687.92
yeah

3714.839 --> 3717.839
e

3726.91 --> 3729.94
[Music]

3736.88 --> 3742.079
do you want me to send you any PX videos

3739.559 --> 3744.559
that I take yeah sure yeah of course

3742.079 --> 3747.119
email me if any of you guys have some

3744.559 --> 3749.6800000000003
good footage or nice

3747.119 --> 3751.88
photographs send it to my email and I

3749.68 --> 3753.48
can review

3751.88 --> 3756.96
it

3753.48 --> 3756.96
absolutely that would be

3760.76 --> 3764.7990000000004
awesome and by the way don't expect to

3763.24 --> 3768.24
be the only one I mean the internet's

3764.799 --> 3771.0
going to be filled with this stuff

3768.24 --> 3774.279
so who knows like there might be some

3771.0 --> 3777.279
people that are going to try some

3774.279 --> 3779.2
real challenging things like I really

3777.279 --> 3782.559
hope somebody's going to take the effort

3779.2 --> 3787.319
to to actually make a

3782.559 --> 3789.76
uh a high altitude balloon try to

3787.319 --> 3791.599
approach the eclipse up close or

3789.76 --> 3794.7200000000003
something I mean that would be really

3791.599 --> 3798.119
interesting to see but it's going to be

3794.72 --> 3798.1189999999997
very tough to aim it

3800.92 --> 3808.96
properly what I see

3803.599 --> 3813.48
there FL video show how predictions are

3808.96 --> 3813.48
made I don't know Greg

3834.72 --> 3837.72
brono

3846.48 --> 3850.799
I had this really weird realization

3850.88 --> 3854.96
yesterday it's a

3859.0 --> 3863.559
suspicion it's just really weird and I

3861.68 --> 3864.72
don't really I don't even know how to

3863.559 --> 3866.7200000000003
link it

3864.72 --> 3867.7599999999998
up

3866.72 --> 3872.48
I think

3867.76 --> 3874.559
that Celestial light especially the sun

3872.48 --> 3878.119
might be

3874.559 --> 3878.119
influenceable through

3878.68 --> 3883.0
sound I was thinking about like the

3884.92 --> 3893.039
trumpets I think that

3889.0 --> 3896.559
maybe they're using like not like lasers

3893.039 --> 3898.76
or whatever or I I think they might be

3896.559 --> 3902.96
using

3898.76 --> 3902.96
sound like ultra low

3903.92 --> 3908.96
frequency to somehow influence the

3906.68 --> 3910.0389999999998
celestial lights that that is part of

3908.96 --> 3913.039
like

3910.039 --> 3913.039
the

3913.68 --> 3916.68
long-term

3921.319 --> 3926.799
geoengineering I had this

3924.079 --> 3927.6800000000003
realization trumpet no has nothing to do

3926.799 --> 3930.079
with an

3927.68 --> 3931.9199999999996
eclipse no it has nothing to do with

3930.079 --> 3935.279
anything we just talked about I just

3931.92 --> 3937.64
remembered this from yesterday night

3935.279 --> 3941.079
that I just thought about it

3937.64 --> 3943.1189999999997
like could they be influencing like for

3941.079 --> 3947.319
example Sun

3943.119 --> 3950.92
intensity by subjecting the realm to

3947.319 --> 3954.16
ultra low frequency for a period of

3950.92 --> 3956.6800000000003
time and because there is like very

3954.16 --> 3959.5989999999997
inexplicable sound

3956.68 --> 3963.5589999999997
like vibration type sounds that

3959.599 --> 3966.839
happen at night in certain periods of

3963.559 --> 3970.039
time certain times of the

3966.839 --> 3973.2
year and is never able to pinpoint like

3970.039 --> 3976.0
where the hell is that coming from like

3973.2 --> 3978.4399999999996
it's not coming from a

3976.0 --> 3979.88
building it's just this weird

3978.44 --> 3983.52
vibrational

3979.88 --> 3985.6400000000003
sound it's not local so that like oh

3983.52 --> 3987.279
I'll just move to another spot in the

3985.64 --> 3988.839
house and then I don't hear it no it's

3987.279 --> 3991.599
like

3988.839 --> 3994.52
everywhere and I can't pinpoint it so

3991.599 --> 3996.44
why would it be there could it be that

3994.52 --> 3999.599
that's like

3996.44 --> 4005.44
influencing like the celestial light

3999.599 --> 4005.44
output somehow or even the the overall

4008.26 --> 4012.7690000000002
[Music]

4013.76 --> 4019.2000000000003

4034.359 --> 4040.7599999999998
out how many teeth for the gears well

4037.2 --> 4040.7599999999998
they would have to have prior

4042.0 --> 4046.88
knowledge the only way that they could

4044.44 --> 4048.52
know it is if there was knowledge about

4046.88 --> 4050.88
the

4048.52 --> 4055.0
Cycles so that would have

4050.88 --> 4055.0
been ancient

4058.2 --> 4063.96
knowledge interesting to see how many

4060.52 --> 4063.96
Chemtrails is popping off

4065.559 --> 4071.039
tomorrow yeah interesting to see if

4068.72 --> 4074.279
they're going to do any if they're like

4071.039 --> 4076.76
going to like do it a lot or not at all

4074.279 --> 4080.039
I mean they should just like leave it

4076.76 --> 4084.279
the hell alone man just let the freaking

4080.039 --> 4088.44
Eclipse just do whatever it does man

4084.279 --> 4088.44
just leave it

4091.85 --> 4095.759

worry so

4113.0 --> 4121.64
much right don't go to it and and stare

4117.359 --> 4125.799
at the eclipse with anxiety or

4121.64 --> 4125.799
nervousness even just enjoy

4127.12 --> 4134.44
it enjoy the magic of it

4131.359 --> 4137.4400000000005

4194.76 --> 4200.360000000001
special no I'm just going to have an

4197.12 --> 4200.36
early bird show as

4201.159 --> 4206.799999999999
usual and I'm probably going to look

4203.56 --> 4210.76
around to see if there's any live

4206.8 --> 4210.76
footage or whatever about

4214.84 --> 4222.04

drown what you think another flood is

4298.8 --> 4303.71

4303.71 --> 4306.949
[Music]

4307.6 --> 4315.52
that want to watch the eclipse with a

4312.28 --> 4318.719
telescope what from where I am at but

4315.52 --> 4318.719
there's nothing to see here

4318.88 --> 4329.71
duper not not from here it's all in

[Music]

4335.04 --> 4339.44

tsunami how

4342.12 --> 4345.88

new don't

4345.88 --> 4351.08
okay wait no it's always the same

4348.199 --> 4351.08
recycle old

4360.88 --> 4366.4400000000005
[ __ ] can see a partial clips from

4363.719 --> 4369.719
Scotland okay

4366.44 --> 4372.48
cool I don't think you can see anything

4369.719 --> 4372.4800000000005
from here in the

4372.6 --> 4378.04
Netherlands but I mean it's okay

4375.88 --> 4380.8
like I'm okay with it like I'm really

4378.04 --> 4384.88
seeing this as a spiritual

4380.8 --> 4384.88
event I really am like

4386.6 --> 4394.679
it's this is time to let go of the

4391.159 --> 4396.638999999999
fear like this is make a

4394.679 --> 4400.719
stand for

4396.639 --> 4402.96
wisdom and Jesus Jesus is wisdom don't

4400.719 --> 4402.96
be

4404.12 --> 4410.12
afraid like it's a special test it's a a

4408.159 --> 4414.239
fire branding test it's

4410.12 --> 4417.44
a cementing the blood kind of

4414.239 --> 4418.879999999999
test what you do how you manage will

4417.44 --> 4422.08
carry

4418.88 --> 4423.400000000001
through and I really want to want to do

4422.08 --> 4426.639
it

4423.4 --> 4426.638999999999
right I want

4427.04 --> 4433.159
to have that right

4430.52 --> 4438.4400000000005
approach right feelings the right wisdom

4433.159 --> 4438.44
and like heal myself and carry that

4438.679 --> 4444.28
through onto the next age potentially

4442.04 --> 4447.12
the rest of my life I that's what I'm

4444.28 --> 4449.04
doing that's that's my focus I'm not

4447.12 --> 4451.8
afraid of disasters I don't think

4449.04 --> 4454.239
there's any disasters going to happen

4451.8 --> 4456.28
well to me at least there might be some

4454.239 --> 4457.959999999999
weird earthquake things happening here

4456.28 --> 4461.0
and

4457.96 --> 4464.08
there but I mean California is not going

4461.0 --> 4468.239
to break off and sink into the ocean

4464.08 --> 4468.239
like nothing like that guys

4470.679 --> 4474.2390000000005
really don't be

[Music]

4482.56 --> 4489.080000000001
afraid clearly Tik Tok is telling people

4485.56 --> 4489.080000000001
the world is ending tomorrow

4489.56 --> 4497.92
well the age of Pisces is ending and the

4494.159 --> 4497.92
age of Aquarius arus is

4498.96 --> 4502.52
Dawning so yeah

4502.88 --> 4506.96
astrologically the old world is

4512.08 --> 4516.04
ending but I mean if you still have like

4514.56 --> 4519.84
that old

4516.04 --> 4522.36
record you might find it a bit stupid or

4519.84 --> 4523.96
whatever but like Age of Aquarius that

4522.36 --> 4527.4
song I

4523.96 --> 4530.28
mean this is the time this is the time

4527.4 --> 4530.28
to play that

4530.96 --> 4536.08
tomorrow really I mean it I mean unless

4534.32 --> 4537.759999999999
you think it's kind of a stupid song but

4536.08 --> 4541.08
if you want to play some kind of song

4537.76 --> 4544.76
that relates to it play that

4541.08 --> 4547.04
song cuz that song is about this moment

4544.76 --> 4547.04
pretty

4550.04 --> 4556.34
much and it brings the Good Vibes it

4552.92 --> 4559.4800000000005
brings the right Vibes too

4556.34 --> 4562.719
[Music]

4559.48 --> 4564.919999999999
shipping container crashes oh I'm sure

4562.719 --> 4567.4800000000005
the diversity hires are going to like do

4564.92 --> 4569.92
all of that yes fiber outs I mean they

4567.48 --> 4573.239
already crashed into another Bridge they

4569.92 --> 4575.6
didn't do anything though I mean you you

4573.239 --> 4579.638999999999
you saw the uh the post that I posted

4575.6 --> 4579.639
that happened like a week ago

4582.92 --> 4586.92
already what is it

4589.56 --> 4595.52
yeah literally from last

4592.56 --> 4597.56
Monday yeah it didn't really uh make it

4595.52 --> 4599.1990000000005
that far but I mean the post is still

4597.56 --> 4602.8
here you can check it out but I mean

4599.199 --> 4606.719
last Monday another ship like bashed

4602.8 --> 4609.88
into a bridge but like yeah the bridge

4606.719 --> 4613.84
that's still held up it it didn't

4609.88 --> 4617.08
just crash down in one go like the other

4613.84 --> 4619.76
one another one I'm sure they're going

4617.08 --> 4622.88
to keep on trying to play The Knockout

4619.76 --> 4625.2390000000005
game with Bridges and

4622.88 --> 4627.84
boats maybe that will even happen

4625.239 --> 4629.5199999999995
tomorrow maybe some [ __ ] bastard

4627.84 --> 4632.52
piece of

4629.52 --> 4632.52
[ __ ]

4632.679 --> 4638.52
gross not properly English-speaking

4636.0 --> 4641.6
piece of [ __ ] is going to accomplish to

4638.52 --> 4643.1990000000005
like bash in a really important bridge

4641.6 --> 4645.159000000001
in the middle of a whole tourist

4643.199 --> 4647.44
situation I mean that would be pretty

4645.159 --> 4647.44
[ __ ]

4648.679 --> 4654.679
up I'm not excluding that something like

4652.239 --> 4654.678999999999
that could

4655.52 --> 4662.080000000001
happen but I mean I don't think it would

4658.88 --> 4665.6
be like any kind of like organized

4662.08 --> 4669.159
terror attack or something I mean people

4665.6 --> 4671.92
might do something really stupid

4669.159 --> 4673.839999999999
again it's all the trend now to like

4671.92 --> 4677.4400000000005
take boats and then bash them into

4673.84 --> 4679.4800000000005
Bridges so yeah maybe that will happen

4677.44 --> 4681.599999999999
again maybe they're going to go for the

4679.48 --> 4683.718999999999
Golden Gate Bridge this time or

what

4715.36 --> 4720.96
okay talking about which I watched a

4717.92 --> 4724.08
movie yesterday that was really exciting

4720.96 --> 4728.36
I thought it was a really awesome movie

4724.08 --> 4728.36
it's a bit of a boomer movie but it was

4728.6 --> 4735.280000000001
awesome fort versus Ferrari you guys

4732.6 --> 4739.320000000001
probably already know about it it's like

4735.28 --> 4742.0
a a real Hollywood star type of movie

4739.32 --> 4746.719
with Christian Bill and Matt

4742.0 --> 4750.32
Davon and it's it was awesome like it

4746.719 --> 4753.32
was so awesome I'll probably watch it

4750.32 --> 4757.84
again I mean Christian bill is such an

4753.32 --> 4761.759999999999
epic character in that holy

4757.84 --> 4761.76
[ __ ] what a character

4763.719 --> 4766.719
man

4768.28 --> 4772.599999999999
but what that was like a

4770.36 --> 4776.639
really

4772.6 --> 4777.88
enjoyable well done Boomer movie like

4776.639 --> 4781.719
Well Done

4777.88 --> 4785.36
Boomers like Boomer

4781.719 --> 4785.36
branding in a good

4786.44 --> 4791.799999999999
way and it's also funny to like that

4789.719 --> 4795.8
it's about Ford because that makes me

4791.8 --> 4799.12
think of like uh some of

4795.8 --> 4803.320000000001
the times where Owen Benjamin brought up

4799.12 --> 4803.32
the whole Ford as a

4803.52 --> 4811.320000000001
subject this was Fort the second but

4807.04 --> 4814.639
yeah that was a great movie great to

4811.32 --> 4814.639
watch very

4816.12 --> 4820.88
exciting and I mean it is historic

4818.719 --> 4823.4
apparently it is that really happened so

4820.88 --> 4823.400000000001
it's pretty

4823.639 --> 4826.639
Epic

4827.36 --> 4831.92
yeah real far out character real life

4829.28 --> 4831.92
yeah I bet he

4839.28 --> 4843.96
was all the corporate drones hated the

4841.88 --> 4846.4400000000005
guy right it's it's like the ultimate

4843.96 --> 4846.44
Boomer

4881.679 --> 4889.56
where I think it was yeah was Matt Damon

4885.96 --> 4892.4800000000005
like took in Fort the second into his

4889.56 --> 4895.159000000001
car it's like oh yeah let me drive you

4892.48 --> 4897.08

4895.159 --> 4900.679
actually worked and the guy's

4897.08 --> 4904.6
like I mean classic I mean totally to be

4900.679 --> 4904.6
expected but that was

4908.52 --> 4913.84
hilarious they yeah I'm sure they it was

4911.12 --> 4915.84
all real it's probably all based on on

4913.84 --> 4918.56
real events

4915.84 --> 4918.56
but it's just

4925.44 --> 4930.12

roads no Christian Bill's just a really

5251.44 --> 5255.879999999999
good actor and they probably have tricks

5254.8 --> 5258.92
with the

5255.88 --> 5262.400000000001
makeup and all that and the lighting so

5258.92 --> 5262.4
that he can look even

5262.679 --> 5266.679
more like the figure he's supposed to be

5265.56 --> 5269.4800000000005
looking

5266.679 --> 5272.639
like to make him more like smooth and

5269.48 --> 5276.119
round-faced or more

5272.639 --> 5276.119
bony either way

5277.679 --> 5285.159
it's just a good malleable

5280.8 --> 5285.159000000001

5649.6 --> 5654.0
flooding that's a pretty heavy flood

5657.28 --> 5660.28
though

5660.88 --> 5665.719
damn I can show that for a bit

5676.44 --> 5680.48
look at that that's that's a pretty

5678.239 --> 5680.48
heavy

5691.679 --> 5698.719
flooding yeah

5694.32 --> 5698.719
hope they manage to fix that

5722.639 --> 5725.639
soon

5731.0 --> 5734.639
what the hell are you babbling

5744.6 --> 5752.56
about what do you mean get God to like

5747.96 --> 5752.56
you burnt offering what kind of

5752.639 --> 5755.639
a

5761.36 --> 5766.839999999999
hello I think you uh might be uh

5764.199 --> 5769.719
choosing the wrong

5766.84 --> 5772.32
God you might want to reconsider your

5769.719 --> 5772.32
approach

5774.6 --> 5777.6
there

5777.719 --> 5781.52
yeah gets God's

5781.56 --> 5787.400000000001
favor through Trust

5785.0 --> 5791.04
trusting in God and doing the right

5787.4 --> 5794.159
thing not through some weird

5791.04 --> 5798.679
ritual especially a ritual that asks you

5794.159 --> 5800.92
to like sacrifice something Earthly I

5798.679 --> 5803.4800000000005
mean what the hell you should know

5800.92 --> 5803.4800000000005
better than

5812.52 --> 5815.52
that

5821.48 --> 5825.638999999999
fiber oats was saying Eric Dubay says

5823.6 --> 5828.4800000000005
God doesn't like

5825.639 --> 5830.679
us yeah well it sounds like Eric Dubay

5828.48 --> 5830.678999999999
is

5836.56 --> 5842.52
projecting sounds more like Eric debay

5839.44 --> 5845.5199999999995
doesn't really like

5842.52 --> 5845.52
God

5846.8 --> 5852.52
or at least doesn't really understand

5849.639 --> 5855.639
God and

5852.52 --> 5855.639
is I

5857.119 --> 5861.199
mean the god of Jesus

5861.8 --> 5866.84
Christ does get oversimplified

5865.53 --> 5871.48
[Music]

5866.84 --> 5874.159000000001
and like it's all love and it's all good

5871.48 --> 5879.36
I I wouldn't agree to that either

5874.159 --> 5879.36
But Eric debay like he just takes it too

5893.0 --> 5901.96
far yeah it's like what do you mean God

5898.28 --> 5905.4
likes dislikes doesn't like like oh so

5901.96 --> 5908.599
you are enterpr more iing God are

5905.4 --> 5911.679
you really you're going to try to reduce

5908.599 --> 5913.8
God the creator of all things of of the

5911.679 --> 5916.4400000000005
material realm and the designer of all

5913.8 --> 5921.0
of it throughout time oh you're going to

5916.44 --> 5921.0
reduce him to an

5921.48 --> 5925.5599999999995
individual to an individual

5923.719 --> 5929.04
Consciousness and

5925.56 --> 5931.84
personality so that it gets closer to

5929.04 --> 5935.44
how we see ourselves and each

5931.84 --> 5935.4400000000005
other just so

5937.4 --> 5943.5599999999995
you can get him closer to

5940.36 --> 5943.5599999999995
[Music]

5948.719 --> 5954.0
you I mean if you're going to try to

5951.36 --> 5957.04
Envision God as a person yeah you're

5954.0 --> 5959.76
going to run into trouble not because

5957.04 --> 5963.44
God doesn't like it but because you get

5959.76 --> 5965.92
into this paradoxical situation because

5963.44 --> 5968.04
of that like I don't think God is a

5965.92 --> 5971.92
person like

5968.04 --> 5974.199
that I think he's outside of outside of

5971.92 --> 5975.76
this realm he's not of this world so why

5974.199 --> 5979.0
would you assume that he would be

5975.76 --> 5980.8
anything like anything in this

5979.0 --> 5984.0
world it

5980.8 --> 5988.28
isn't yeah and when he creates things in

5984.0 --> 5992.48
His image that doesn't mean in his

5988.28 --> 5996.8
likess the word that does get used in

5992.48 --> 5999.919999999999
the Bible likeness yeah yet that wasn't

5996.8 --> 6002.56
used specifically when mentioned

5999.92 --> 6005.08
creating things in His image yeah they

6002.56 --> 6007.92
didn't use the word likeness even though

6005.08 --> 6009.44
the word likeness does get used in the

6007.92 --> 6012.36
Bible

6009.44 --> 6015.678999999999
H so why the hell does everybody keep

6012.36 --> 6020.0
assuming that God is like a

6015.679 --> 6023.1990000000005
man like a person I don't get

6020.0 --> 6024.92
it no not a freaking woman shut the hell

6023.199 --> 6029.0
up up

6024.92 --> 6029.0
Fester blue Air piss

6031.719 --> 6037.56
off yeah I mean the gods little G Gods

6036.56 --> 6041.119000000001
the

6037.56 --> 6043.599
Shapers Elohim they might have been

6041.119 --> 6046.639
somewhat like

6043.599 --> 6049.360000000001
humans closer to

6046.639 --> 6054.4800000000005
us bizarre

6049.36 --> 6056.679
figures that do have individual natures

6054.48 --> 6061.959999999999
who says the designer of all things that

6056.679 --> 6061.96
is outside of creation is anything like

6062.52 --> 6069.4800000000005
that people say that and arguably even

6066.04 --> 6069.48
the little G Gods say

6070.36 --> 6075.08
that could they be wrong could they be

6072.92 --> 6077.4
lying could they be projecting could the

6075.08 --> 6080.5599999999995
little G Gods be projecting about the

6077.4 --> 6085.159
almighty designer just like human beings

6080.56 --> 6089.84
project onto God and the

6085.159 --> 6091.879999999999
gods them their own being as individuals

6089.84 --> 6096.08
do could it

6091.88 --> 6097.599
be could it be that everybody's just

6096.08 --> 6101.0
projecting

6097.599 --> 6104.0
including the sons of God including the

6101.0 --> 6106.36
Elohim could they just be projecting

6104.0 --> 6109.32
their individual Natures could it be

6106.36 --> 6110.92
that if you have any form of ego you end

6109.32 --> 6115.239
up

6110.92 --> 6118.1990000000005
projecting that nature nature unto

6115.239 --> 6118.199
something that is

6118.48 --> 6122.119
greater leading to

6122.76 --> 6126.52
anthropomorphization and that kind of

6131.48 --> 6138.0
thing hey tin foil cat good see you I'm

6134.92 --> 6138.0
doing good yeah I'm doing

6138.119 --> 6143.88
good do you have beef with Mikey Smith I

6141.56 --> 6147.52
don't know who the hell Mikey Smith

6143.88 --> 6147.52
is called me a

6147.8 --> 6152.360000000001
[ __ ] on his show at

6153.06 --> 6160.119000000001
[Music]

6155.76 --> 6160.119000000001
okay I don't know who that

6172.119 --> 6175.119
is

6185.679 --> 6191.36
no fibro it's a [ __ ] troll ferrets

6189.159 --> 6191.36
are

6197.84 --> 6206.599
trolls just like samosas and Baldwin and

6203.4 --> 6210.0
[ __ ] elf and Illuminati kasan that's

6206.599 --> 6211.400000000001
all them they like they at some point

6210.0 --> 6213.76
thought that they were going to call

6211.4 --> 6213.759999999999
themselves

6216.52 --> 6222.2390000000005
ferrets it's terrets

6219.239 --> 6222.239
gang

6231.28 --> 6236.679
so Mikey is a weird

6235.04 --> 6239.28
okay well I don't know what the hell I

6236.679 --> 6239.28
did

6241.36 --> 6246.119
wrong but I mean if he's a proper weirdo

6244.44 --> 6248.839999999999
and he called

6246.119 --> 6252.96
me a piece of

6248.84 --> 6255.119000000001
[ __ ] okay that's fine call me a piece of

6252.96 --> 6258.28
[ __ ] I mean I don't know

6255.119 --> 6261.839999999999
why if he' gave a reason then I could

6258.28 --> 6263.36
perhaps address that but I mean it

6261.84 --> 6266.92
wouldn't be the first time some somebody

6263.36 --> 6266.92
called me a piece of [ __ ]

6267.96 --> 6275.0
cuz yeah I do get on people's nerves

6272.159 --> 6278.0289999999995
sometimes all right that

6275.0 --> 6278.029
[Music]

6292.04 --> 6295.04
happens

6313.8 --> 6320.4400000000005
what I have no proof of a globe oh you

6318.28 --> 6321.96
must

6320.44 --> 6324.96
have

6321.96 --> 6324.96
what

6325.92 --> 6333.2390000000005
he may have heard like one of

6328.76 --> 6336.4400000000005
my Ballwin rants or something I did talk

6333.239 --> 6338.759999999999
yesterday about how

6336.44 --> 6341.799999999999
[Music]

6338.76 --> 6344.159000000001
gravity like how they need to fix the

6341.8 --> 6346.8
second law thermodynamics

6344.159 --> 6349.119
issue and how their current model is

6346.8 --> 6351.52
just not working and how they should fix

6349.119 --> 6353.679
it so I did a little Ballwin maneuver

6351.52 --> 6354.88
maybe that threatened him

6353.679 --> 6358.159
I mean I

6354.88 --> 6361.0
know I know

6358.159 --> 6362.5199999999995
Ballwin is like a a Jesuit

6361.0 --> 6367.08
[Music]

6362.52 --> 6369.719
Antichrist I mean I can actually like

6367.08 --> 6373.159
keep maintaining and fixing the ball

6369.719 --> 6378.599
religion like nobody else out there I

6373.159 --> 6381.92
know I can I have this terrible terrible

6378.599 --> 6384.92
power and I have to contain

6381.92 --> 6384.92
it

6387.28 --> 6395.08
it's like in the age of the Apocalypse

6390.36 --> 6398.38
like I'm I got this power to basically

6395.08 --> 6399.599
potentially keep the ball religion

6398.38 --> 6402.52
[Music]

6399.599 --> 6406.069
alive if they all run out of

6402.52 --> 6406.069
[Music]

6410.239 --> 6416.119
ideas cuz with B believer the biggest

6413.8 --> 6418.599
problem is that they tend to like just

6416.119 --> 6421.36
recycle and build everything up with

6418.599 --> 6425.88
everything that's already made but that

6421.36 --> 6429.159
ends up in having a just a giant lack of

6425.88 --> 6432.400000000001
creativity something that I don't have

6429.159 --> 6436.04
an issue like I don't have that

6432.4 --> 6437.759999999999
issue like I can figure out how to

6436.04 --> 6441.08
theoretically

6437.76 --> 6441.08
conceptually fix

6441.679 --> 6446.04
it I can fix baller

6446.08 --> 6452.48
problems I can literally make up [ __ ]

6449.8 --> 6456.0
that will actually

6452.48 --> 6459.04
work I know the parameters I know how to

6456.0 --> 6462.44
make it work I know how to conjure [ __ ]

6459.04 --> 6466.88
out of absolutely nothing and make it

6462.44 --> 6470.0
work fill the gaps I know how to do

6466.88 --> 6472.32
it and that can be threatening to some

6470.0 --> 6474.48
flat earthers that are just like really

6472.32 --> 6477.199
obsessed with the polarized position of

6474.48 --> 6479.919999999999
like the ball is the enemy we must

6477.199 --> 6483.199
exterminate the ball religion and like

6479.92 --> 6486.1990000000005
yeah good luck

6483.199 --> 6491.36
that I mean we can prove the Earth is

6486.199 --> 6491.36
flat the apocalypse is on our side

6492.84 --> 6500.8
like it is we win but that doesn't mean

6497.36 --> 6500.799999999999
that the globe religion goes

6501.76 --> 6504.76
away

6505.48 --> 6512.638999999999
like it will

6508.0 --> 6515.239
remain obscure perhaps more secretive

6512.639 --> 6518.84
secretive about their nonsense just like

6515.239 --> 6520.919999999999
in the earlier days right when the

6518.84 --> 6524.2390000000005
Jesuits and the

6520.92 --> 6525.96
astronomers kept the ball

6524.239 --> 6528.799999999999
religion

6525.96 --> 6532.8
secret secret from the

6528.8 --> 6534.1990000000005
public until the Catholic church in

6532.8 --> 6537.52
combination with the Kings and the

6534.199 --> 6539.839999999999
Empire and all that just made a Swit Shu

6537.52 --> 6542.639
and then made up this har [ __ ] story

6539.84 --> 6545.679
about how the church

6542.639 --> 6547.56
persecuted the astronomers oh yeah sure

6545.679 --> 6550.32
they did no no they

6547.56 --> 6552.04
harbored and like created the

6550.32 --> 6554.5599999999995
astronomers and then they did the

6552.04 --> 6557.119
switcheroo pretending like the old guard

6554.56 --> 6559.1990000000005
was all against

6557.119 --> 6563.44
them like they had

6559.199 --> 6567.239
to overcome the Christian bigotry

6563.44 --> 6569.119
against science science yeah that's all

6567.239 --> 6572.32
their madeup shitty

6569.119 --> 6576.5199999999995
story they actually created all

6572.32 --> 6576.5199999999995
that it's all from the Catholic

6581.679 --> 6588.599
church

6583.239 --> 6588.598999999999
but in those times in the earlier times

6588.76 --> 6596.4400000000005
people did not have like this Foundation

6593.76 --> 6598.2390000000005
this painted in Foundation that like oh

6596.44 --> 6600.36
yeah we're on a globe of course and they

6598.239 --> 6603.48
didn't have continual Globe stories they

6600.36 --> 6605.96
didn't have Globes spinning over their

6603.48 --> 6608.879999999999
heads in their crib

6605.96 --> 6612.159
Etc that's pretty much 20th century when

6608.88 --> 6614.56
that started so in the earlier days yeah

6612.159 --> 6617.4
the Jesuits and the

6614.56 --> 6619.639
astronomers they they did math stuff to

6617.4 --> 6621.159
try to figure out how these orbits are

6619.639 --> 6623.76
supposed to work how the forces are

6621.159 --> 6625.5199999999995
supposed to work and they kept it secret

6623.76 --> 6627.76
they kept it

6625.52 --> 6630.599
occult and they were regarded to

6627.76 --> 6634.320000000001
Outsiders as just crazy

6630.599 --> 6637.52
Wizards with their bizarre ideas because

6634.32 --> 6640.48
that's what they are and with the

6637.52 --> 6640.4800000000005
apocalypse right

6641.0 --> 6647.96
now they're basically being forced to

6643.679 --> 6651.04
retreat once again into that occultism

6647.96 --> 6653.639
eventually like eventually like the the

6651.04 --> 6657.0
grip on society

6653.639 --> 6659.76
with globe programming will

6657.0 --> 6662.04
falter and then it will kind of retreat

6659.76 --> 6663.599
and the idea will become

6662.04 --> 6665.679
like

6663.599 --> 6667.2390000000005
yeah there's a lot of people that

6665.679 --> 6668.4
believe the Earth is flat we don't

6667.239 --> 6670.598999999999
really believe it I mean it's

6668.4 --> 6673.159
interesting stories good graphics but I

6670.599 --> 6676.32
mean it's not really

6673.159 --> 6678.4
real and so it will then Retreat Back

6676.32 --> 6681.36
Into

6678.4 --> 6683.679
Obscurity it doesn't mean it will go

6681.36 --> 6686.079
away yeah

6683.679 --> 6687.56
it doesn't it just means it will go Back

6686.079 --> 6690.32
Into

6687.56 --> 6694.52
Obscurity and then at a later time

6690.32 --> 6698.84
especially in a time of great tumultuous

6694.52 --> 6702.079000000001
crisis they will try to bring it

6698.84 --> 6706.28
back it's going to

6702.079 --> 6706.28
happen it will always keep

6708.4 --> 6714.5199999999995
happening they will always keep

6711.52 --> 6714.52
trying

6753.199 --> 6757.239
Ballwin

6754.92 --> 6759.52
conversation part of the reason why he

6757.239 --> 6759.5199999999995
did

6760.44 --> 6764.719
that or was he just in a bad

6769.36 --> 6774.44

on yeah but I mean this is what I'm

8634.479 --> 8641.119999999999
talking about these [ __ ]

8637.8 --> 8644.92
retards that just spastically have to

8641.12 --> 8644.92
just roll out

8648.56 --> 8654.24
horeshit it's it's the robotic nature of

8652.04 --> 8655.92
it that pisses me off I mean if it's

8654.24 --> 8657.96
just a bunch of nerds that are just

8655.92 --> 8661.12
rolling out facts or they're like haha

8657.96 --> 8663.599999999999
there's something funny I get it but

8661.12 --> 8666.880000000001
this is just

8663.6 --> 8671.04
nonsense and they're like waiting like

8666.88 --> 8674.08
cockroaches under a rock under the

8671.04 --> 8675.68
fridge just waiting for something to be

8674.08 --> 8678.24
brought up and then they just

8675.68 --> 8680.800000000001
immediately come out just to spam their

8678.24 --> 8683.6
nonsense with like two three four people

8680.8 --> 8688.039999999999
at the same time like is that what you

8683.6 --> 8692.319
do with your life you're a [ __ ] freak

8688.04 --> 8692.319000000001
you're a freak look at

8695.2 --> 8700.319000000001
yourself if I had to look in the mirror

8697.92 --> 8702.960000000001
and it turns out I was one of you guys

8700.319 --> 8706.399
I'd freaking stab my eyes

8702.96 --> 8706.399
out this is

8706.56 --> 8710.56
mortifying look at what you

8712.319 --> 8719.319
do you should be ashamed of yourself

8715.88 --> 8722.319
doing what you do this is

8719.319 --> 8722.319
pathetic

8731.479 --> 8737.16
yeah that's a good description there J

8733.479 --> 8742.24
they're not creative or funny just weird

8737.16 --> 8745.92
hate and boredom yeah look at

8742.24 --> 8748.84
you be ashamed of yourself you should be

8745.92 --> 8748.84
ashamed of

8748.96 --> 8755.24
yourself cu this is what you do and you

8752.64 --> 8755.24
keep doing

8756.479 --> 8766.039999999999
it why don't you just move on with your

8761.479 --> 8768.199999999999
life yeah find greener

8766.04 --> 8772.160000000002
pastures find

8768.2 --> 8774.84
something more productive more

8772.16 --> 8776.96
stimulating in a positive

8774.84 --> 8779.24
way I don't get

8776.96 --> 8782.24
it

8779.24 --> 8782.24
anyway

8784.52 --> 8790.12
and magnesium citrate works amazingly I

8786.92 --> 8793.359
mean yeah sure the only designation that

8790.12 --> 8797.560000000001
is officially given might be a lexent

8793.359 --> 8800.479000000001
but I found other functions for it as

8797.56 --> 8803.479
well I've found it from practical

8800.479 --> 8807.56
experience to work against acute tooth

8803.479 --> 8812.679999999998
AE like in the moment a pain

8807.56 --> 8815.039999999999
flare take it rinse it around and it

8812.68 --> 8817.399
would like immediately make the the

8815.04 --> 8822.160000000002
acute pain

8817.399 --> 8825.399
stop I don't know why it does that but

8822.16 --> 8829.439
it seemed to have done that and it does

8825.399 --> 8834.68
kind of require further testing

8829.439 --> 8834.68
like would that work with other forms of

8836.8 --> 8842.119999999999
magnesium but it it's a thing it's a

8839.72 --> 8844.88
thing that I figured out from practical

8842.12 --> 8849.76
experience I don't have any explanation

8844.88 --> 8849.759999999998
as to how that's working just that it is

8857.13 --> 8863.878999999999
[Applause]

8865.92 --> 8871.359
working wonder if there's a liquid form

8868.399 --> 8873.72
of magnesium yeah definitely there is

8871.359 --> 8873.720000000001
fiber

8875.12 --> 8882.0
outs it's called milk of magnesium I

8878.2 --> 8884.800000000001
think right but I'm going to see if I

8882.0 --> 8886.84
can find any type of magnesium oriented

8884.8 --> 8889.64
supplements but I have to wait until I

8886.84 --> 8889.64
got a bit more

8899.12 --> 8902.12
budget

8909.98 --> 8913.35
[Music]

8929.04 --> 8932.04

8933.479 --> 8938.679999999998
switch

[Music]

8990.64 --> 8998.319

be careful

8999.56 --> 9002.708999999999
[Music]

9002.88 --> 9008.679999999998
though I mean I wouldn't like want to

9005.84 --> 9012.960000000001
like breathe in Sage

9008.68 --> 9012.960000000001
smoke like directly over the

9014.24 --> 9022.8
lungs I mean to have it hang in the

9017.68 --> 9025.439
room like well like sage like

9022.8 --> 9027.84
incense and that's fine breathing it in

9025.439 --> 9030.479000000001
and everything but I mean over the lungs

9027.84 --> 9030.479
that's pretty

9033.6 --> 9041.12
rough too late okay

9036.68 --> 9041.12
fine just just be careful with

9043.52 --> 9048.92
it like I've tried that once in the past

9046.479 --> 9051.16
and that just really

9048.92 --> 9054.72
hurts

9051.16 --> 9054.72
was really smooth oh

9056.08 --> 9061.68
okay it may depend on the the quality of

9059.08 --> 9061.68
sage

9064.279 --> 9071.960000000001
though I never like tried organic Sage

9068.04 --> 9071.960000000001
for that maybe that is

9078.92 --> 9081.92
different

9098.58 --> 9104.359
[Music]

9101.2 --> 9106.640000000001
wow there was a troll

9104.359 --> 9109.16
message that didn't even get through I

9106.64 --> 9111.84
had to switch the live chat to even see

9109.16 --> 9111.84
that it was

9121.84 --> 9128.72
amazing guys I am so bald I can't

9124.92 --> 9132.16
believe it I can't believe I'm so bald I

9128.72 --> 9135.438999999998
mean oh wait no that's all hair just

9132.16 --> 9137.92
like 10 years

9135.439 --> 9141.84
ago

9137.92 --> 9141.84
yeah keep keep saying it

9147.6 --> 9155.12
though I mean by the

9152.12 --> 9158.479000000001
time I'd lose enough hair to like

9155.12 --> 9165.04
actually call myself bald all these

9158.479 --> 9165.039999999999
people are going to be bald way before I

9165.319 --> 9171.68
am like even if they're teens now that

9168.399 --> 9174.16
are just having a full had a hair by the

9171.68 --> 9178.319
time I actually get Bal enough that I'd

9174.16 --> 9178.319
call myself bald they're all going to be

9181.319 --> 9185.88
bald I maybe they already are I don't

9184.08 --> 9188.56
know why the hell they keep trying to do

9185.88 --> 9188.56
that it's so

9193.279 --> 9200.04
stupid I'm sorry I got hair I'm really

9197.56 --> 9203.399
sorry not going to cut it not going to

9200.04 --> 9206.92
do anything about it I got

9203.399 --> 9206.92
hair I'm loving

9207.319 --> 9214.319
it I'm going to wash my hair

9210.399 --> 9218.439
though later today that's definitely

9214.319 --> 9218.439
necessary with all the extra heat

9219.71 --> 9222.91
[Music]

9223.84 --> 9228.56
especially why spend all your time in

9226.08 --> 9231.72
that negative mind space yeah I know I

9228.56 --> 9231.72
agree fiber outs

9233.319 --> 9238.96
person would grow out of that unless

9236.0 --> 9238.96
there's nowhere to

9239.96 --> 9245.16
grow right they might like be stuck on a

9242.76 --> 9247.92
rock and it's just they got this little

9245.16 --> 9250.72
square of dirt in which they can root

9247.92 --> 9250.72
and they can't get

9251.92 --> 9256.479
out they might have maneuvered

9254.359 --> 9259.319
themselves to a place where they're just

9256.479 --> 9261.399
stuck and they're like really bored and

9259.319 --> 9263.88
they're really

9261.399 --> 9265.68
dissatisfied it's not really working out

9263.88 --> 9268.319
for them they're getting squeezed and

9265.68 --> 9270.439
they can't get out or they're afraid to

9268.319 --> 9274.479
maneuver out they're afraid to take a

9270.439 --> 9277.2
risk and and find a better life for

9274.479 --> 9279.679999999998
themselves yeah maybe that is it I think

9277.2 --> 9281.399000000001
that that is actually probably the Big

9279.68 --> 9285.84
Driver behind

9281.399 --> 9288.24
it like they're to afraid to take a risk

9285.84 --> 9291.479
and improve their

9288.24 --> 9293.399
lives which will require a risk to go

9291.479 --> 9296.039999999999
away from the more safe

9293.399 --> 9299.92
routes and they're projecting that on me

9296.04 --> 9302.76
saying like why aren't you doing these

9299.92 --> 9305.52
things are you getting a job getting

9302.76 --> 9308.439
this and that like Oh you mean the thing

9305.52 --> 9310.279
that you actually know that you need to

9308.439 --> 9314.0
do

9310.279 --> 9315.84
better cuz your life kind of sucks sucks

9314.0 --> 9318.8
enough that you keep coming back on a

9315.84 --> 9321.64
daily basis waiting the background until

9318.8 --> 9321.64
something

9322.68 --> 9328.68
is sad that suddenly causes you to

9325.96 --> 9331.479
Scurry from underneath your fridge like

9328.68 --> 9333.56
a [ __ ] Crouch and just spout your

9331.479 --> 9337.24
nonsense that's what you're waiting for

9333.56 --> 9339.88
all day yeah maybe you're projecting

9337.24 --> 9344.52
maybe you're projecting that your life

9339.88 --> 9347.759999999998
actually really sucks despite it being

9344.52 --> 9350.560000000001
safe right you might be safe but it

9347.76 --> 9353.279
sucks and you really want to get out of

9350.56 --> 9355.199999999999
it and you're too afraid to do it and so

9353.279 --> 9358.479000000001
you're just continually projecting that

9355.2 --> 9360.560000000001
[ __ ] onto me telling me where did you go

9358.479 --> 9362.64
do something else you get a

9360.56 --> 9367.439
[Music]

9362.64 --> 9370.199999999999
job yeah it's projection as usual that's

9367.439 --> 9372.880000000001
what I think it is it's most usually it

9370.2 --> 9376.640000000001
is projection every time the troll does

9372.88 --> 9376.64
something like that it's usually

9377.64 --> 9384.599999999999
because they're trying to to tell

9381.08 --> 9384.6
themselves to do

9391.92 --> 9395.76
that trolls are

9398.479 --> 9401.479
fanboys

9408.52 --> 9412.880000000001
Maybe

9410.96 --> 9415.88
it's my new

9412.88 --> 9415.88
gem

9418.68 --> 9424.960000000001
what what you mean you're now just smoke

9421.96 --> 9424.96
Sage

9433.64 --> 9438.96
okay all right I I hope it works out I

9437.64 --> 9441.439
don't know what the long-term

9438.96 --> 9443.919999999998
consequence are of like actually smoking

9441.439 --> 9443.92
it like

9445.04 --> 9449.399000000001
that mix with some herb oh

9450.08 --> 9453.64
okay death

9462.72 --> 9467.64
what look I'm not saying like there's

9464.88 --> 9470.56
some official warning about like

9467.64 --> 9473.56
smoking Sage it's just that in my

9470.56 --> 9476.399
experience of like trying to inhale the

9473.56 --> 9478.64
smoke it it just hurt my throat and

9476.399 --> 9481.24
lungs at the time so that's what I was

9478.64 --> 9481.24
basing that

9482.479 --> 9485.479
on

9489.28 --> 9493.569000000001
[Music]

9494.439 --> 9498.319
wow it's a different

9498.439 --> 9501.439
Buzz

9503.96 --> 9511.0
that's interesting because I mean Sage

9506.439 --> 9511.0
is often used for Spiritual

9518.12 --> 9522.92
purification and it's interesting also

9520.84 --> 9524.0
because while your lungs are surrounding

9522.92 --> 9526.68
your

9524.0 --> 9531.12
heart your heart

9526.68 --> 9535.439
is the Anchor Point for your

9531.12 --> 9539.2
spirit so I'm just kind of curious as to

9535.439 --> 9539.2
like what that will

9542.2 --> 9549.319000000001
do just try it once why why would I try

9546.279 --> 9551.720000000001
it I don't know why I why I would I mean

9549.319 --> 9554.08
maybe I'll burn some sage just to like

9551.72 --> 9557.08
purify the place or

9554.08 --> 9557.08
whatever

9557.399 --> 9562.319
sure but I don't feel like trying to

9560.04 --> 9565.319000000001
actually smoke it but

9562.319 --> 9565.319
just

9588.319 --> 9591.319
n

9606.04 --> 9612.560000000001
Ste cockroaches no not really I think I

9609.68 --> 9612.56
kicked most of them

9618.319 --> 9621.319
out

9635.359 --> 9639.16
no I'm actually kind of run out of the

9639.8 --> 9644.438999999998
subject it's been a kind of a mess

9648.24 --> 9651.24
today

9657.439 --> 9660.12
okay you're going to go back to painting

9658.72 --> 9662.56
F okay

9660.12 --> 9667.2
cool take it easy hope you enjoyed the

9662.56 --> 9667.199999999999
show I got nine uploades by now

9678.24 --> 9681.24
wow

9694.12 --> 9698.240000000002
right 5 hours

9700.16 --> 9708.24
bro have we made a dent yet well I guess

9704.96 --> 9711.24
we're halfway 5 hours but I

9708.24 --> 9711.24
mean

9721.96 --> 9726.64
I mean that's going to have to be uh at

9724.359 --> 9729.52
least a couple of super chats if you're

9726.64 --> 9734.039999999999
actually willing to make

9729.52 --> 9734.04
me wanting to make me go that

9738.16 --> 9742.439
far

9740.08 --> 9744.96
and a suggestion on what to talk about

9742.439 --> 9744.960000000001
might also

9746.2 --> 9753.16
help definitely I I don't want to like

9749.76 --> 9753.16
go addressing the trolls

9756.24 --> 9760.8
again whatever's left of them I think I

9758.96 --> 9763.358999999999
squished most of them but I'm sure

9760.8 --> 9763.358999999999
they'll be

9768.12 --> 9771.12
back

9782.0 --> 9786.24
right but I mean the overall message is

9784.24 --> 9788.8
just like yeah tomorrow the eclipse take

9786.24 --> 9791.359
it easy it's going to be

9788.8 --> 9793.92
crowded there might be another boat

9791.359 --> 9795.880000000001
bumping into a big bridge or something

9793.92 --> 9799.8
so be wary of

9795.88 --> 9804.0
that make sure wherever you're going

9799.8 --> 9805.0
that you bring food and drinks with you

9804.0 --> 9807.12
from

9805.0 --> 9809.2
home like especially if you're going to

9807.12 --> 9811.68
get stuck somewhere because a bridge is

9809.2 --> 9814.16
suddenly collapsed right you're going to

9811.68 --> 9816.319
be very happy if everybody has their own

9814.16 --> 9818.84
foods and drink otherwise it's going to

9816.319 --> 9823.278999999999
be very annoying and

9818.84 --> 9825.359
tedious right and you don't want to eat

9823.279 --> 9829.319000000001
anything that's like been freshly

9825.359 --> 9831.359
prepared under the eclipse and my might

9829.319 --> 9834.199999999999
have some

9831.359 --> 9837.2
weird bacterial issues or

9834.2 --> 9837.2
whatever

9842.84 --> 9852.84
so yeah just be prepared and take it

9847.319 --> 9854.68
easy relax don't be afraid for

9852.84 --> 9857.16
Spiritual

9854.68 --> 9860.76
Impressions like just make sure to just

9857.16 --> 9863.52
relax and just remember the springtime

9860.76 --> 9866.76
is here and it's going to be a good time

9863.52 --> 9871.08
and the age of Aquarius is here and

9866.76 --> 9873.64
project onto it the good things and

9871.08 --> 9873.64
Christ's

very much for the

9903.52 --> 9906.52
support

9910.88 --> 9915.88
awesome better cin cannabis and some

9917.96 --> 9922.96
Sage

9919.56 --> 9925.88
I don't know I don't know how that would

9922.96 --> 9927.15
combine Sage with cannabis I've never

9925.88 --> 9930.33
tried

9927.15 --> 9930.33
[Music]

9930.6 --> 9935.720000000001
that but I'm not really smoking cannabis

9933.479 --> 9935.72
now

9935.84 --> 9942.12
anyway I'm more about the hashes at this

9938.68 --> 9942.12
moment and just little

9947.72 --> 9952.519999999999
amounts and that seems to be working

9950.16 --> 9955.72
just fine it it it relaxes me I like the

9952.52 --> 9958.720000000001
taste and doesn't give me like weird and

9955.72 --> 9961.278999999999
anxiety anymore as long as I keep the

9958.72 --> 9961.278999999999
dosage

9961.6 --> 9968.24
low you could get decent hash here it's

9964.8 --> 9968.24
it's tough to find the good

9969.72 --> 9974.438999999998
stuff not readily available

9977.92 --> 9980.92
h

9981.84 --> 9986.6
but over here they're just finding ways

9984.08 --> 9991.68
to make

9986.6 --> 9994.04
it so like there's like newer ways to

9991.68 --> 9996.84
make it

9994.04 --> 9998.880000000001
now and sometimes it works out really

9996.84 --> 10000.56
great and other times it works out not

9998.88 --> 10003.519999999999
so

10000.56 --> 10006.64
great it just like feels like really

10003.52 --> 10012.439
compacted cannabis or

10006.64 --> 10012.439
something so it's yeah kind of trial and

10023.96 --> 10029.479
error to make it over there 10 minut

10027.04 --> 10033.960000000001
yeah sure no dude it would be awesome

10029.479 --> 10035.24
to to do like a meet maybe sometime and

10033.96 --> 10041.24
have a

10035.24 --> 10045.88
smoke that would be awesome one to go to

10041.24 --> 10048.92
Iceland quite badly Iceland sounds

10045.88 --> 10052.91
awesome especially during

10048.92 --> 10055.95
summertime winter maybe not so

10052.91 --> 10055.95
[Music]

10067.84 --> 10070.84
much

10097.72 --> 10105.64
h

10100.319 --> 10108.72
H damn it looks like the beautiful blue

10105.64 --> 10112.039999999999
skies are getting covered

10108.72 --> 10112.039999999999
up uh

10113.12 --> 10118.0
well was really nice while it lasted

10118.2 --> 10122.560000000001
though and it's still kind of warm

10124.0 --> 10129.8
outside so this looks very similar to

10126.64 --> 10133.278999999999
what happened yesterday and except the

10129.8 --> 10133.278999999999
Blue Sky did last a bit

10135.279 --> 10142.439
longer I guess the uh nice and warm sun

10138.76 --> 10147.24
is is gone for now fortunate

10142.439 --> 10147.24
unfortunately I guess maybe it will rain

10156.08 --> 10163.64
again where the add plastic sck and use

10159.64 --> 10165.399
engine oil what I have no idea where

10163.64 --> 10168.039999999999
you're getting that from borders boy

10165.399 --> 10168.039999999999
that sounds

10170.279 --> 10175.640000000001
disgusting why the hell would they add

10172.8 --> 10175.64
plastic that's

10187.64 --> 10190.64
horrendous

10193.12 --> 10197.08
AC like why why would you even want to

10196.12 --> 10200.0
do

10197.08 --> 10203.84
that why the hell would you use engine

10200.0 --> 10203.84
oil in hashes that's

10214.68 --> 10220.6
insane that's bulking agents yeah but

10217.399 --> 10224.0
it's the worst bulking agent ever when

10220.6 --> 10226.08
you can use nontoxic

10224.0 --> 10230.08
oil that is

10226.08 --> 10235.359
cheaper as a bulking agent this is

10230.08 --> 10235.359
insane those people are nuts borders

10243.12 --> 10246.259
[Music]

10441.68 --> 10448.7
with my brain as I'm watching it

10445.479 --> 10452.039999999999

10448.7 --> 10452.04
[Music]

[Music]

10517.319 --> 10520.319
h

10534.8 --> 10537.92
wow okay everything you've been learning

10536.76 --> 10543.04
is in those

10537.92 --> 10543.04
paintings well it's certainly very

10545.04 --> 10551.68
active like the way it's assem is like

10549.12 --> 10554.94
very intense and

10551.68 --> 10558.04
detailed very

10554.94 --> 10558.04
[Music]

10561.53 --> 10572.83
[Music]

10577.239 --> 10581.6
structured it's kind of funny because

10579.76 --> 10585.359
like the whole thing you just have to

10581.6 --> 10585.359
like look at every part

10586.319 --> 10590.88
separately to really see what's there

10588.76 --> 10592.880000000001
you have to like zoom in and isolate it

10590.88 --> 10595.72
to like more carefully see what's

10592.88 --> 10598.399
actually there because the whole thing

10595.72 --> 10600.92
kind of distorts the the details of a

10598.399 --> 10603.0
singular spot it's weird the whole thing

10600.92 --> 10606.279
it's it's really

10603.0 --> 10607.239
weird how it influences the viewer it's

10606.279 --> 10610.239
very

10607.239 --> 10610.239
interesting

10621.319 --> 10624.359

guy I know that is actually

10699.8 --> 10704.08
making like this singular

10701.92 --> 10705.52
counterargument that Modern Art is

10704.08 --> 10708.359
completely

10705.52 --> 10711.960000000001
useless it's like you're the one guy

10708.359 --> 10715.08
that just makes Modern Art that's

10711.96 --> 10716.96
actually interesting which is like you

10715.08 --> 10720.439
don't expect

10716.96 --> 10722.239
that but it is apparently possible it's

10720.439 --> 10723.960000000001

11047.319 --> 11053.88
stuff is really interesting fiber

11050.2 --> 11057.76
outs again as I said like I am really

11053.88 --> 11060.599999999999
not a fan of Modern Art but I would

11057.76 --> 11060.6
consider your

11064.88 --> 11068.839999999998
work 500

11070.359 --> 11073.68
piece not

11084.52 --> 11090.16
bad yeah FS I mean to be fair with the

11088.0 --> 11093.08
quality and especially if you keep this

11090.16 --> 11095.84
up and getting even

11093.08 --> 11098.6
better you could probably run in the

11095.84 --> 11101.479
thousands eventually once you really get

11098.6 --> 11104.319
a name because it is all about branding

11101.479 --> 11107.438999999998
it's all about the name you make but I

11104.319 --> 11110.16
mean your stuff is really good it's it's

11107.439 --> 11113.399
actually interesting Modern

11110.16 --> 11116.479
Art actually interesting and that is

11113.399 --> 11118.599999999999
that's kind of rare like it's rare that

11116.479 --> 11120.239
it's not just

11118.6 --> 11126.08
aggressive and

11120.239 --> 11128.84
disgusting or really like mutilated and

11126.08 --> 11132.08
inhuman which is usually the direction

11128.84 --> 11135.960000000001
most modern arts takes but yours are

11132.08 --> 11137.399
actually like psychedelic and surreal

11135.96 --> 11140.479
without being

11137.399 --> 11144.68
aggressive and that is that is kind of

11140.479 --> 11144.679999999998
unique it's very interesting

11146.64 --> 11149.64
stuff

11150.0 --> 11154.439
so keep it up man it's this is just

11162.279 --> 11166.12
great also it's kind of cool to just

11164.96 --> 11171.0
know a

11166.12 --> 11171.0
guy that makes modern art that I could

11176.56 --> 11179.56
recommend

11180.12 --> 11185.08
right it's like knowing something that I

11182.2 --> 11187.04
can improve a modern art sector with

11185.08 --> 11189.359
it's like somebody's like oh I'm into

11187.04 --> 11191.399000000001
modern art and all and then like looking

11189.359 --> 11195.279
around it's just

11191.399 --> 11198.68
like and well then I can have like

11195.279 --> 11200.399000000001
hey have you ever seen the work of this

11198.68 --> 11204.56
guy

11200.399 --> 11207.76
like potentially use you to help improve

11204.56 --> 11210.68
some kind of Modern Art scene I mean

11207.76 --> 11210.68
it's just a great

11211.72 --> 11218.679999999998
opportunity we're kind of old talented

11215.2 --> 11220.6
people to be fair everybody has their

11218.68 --> 11223.2
own talents and you certainly have a

11220.6 --> 11223.2
talent for

11224.64 --> 11230.72
this and I feel very thankful to know

11227.84 --> 11233.04
you because it is genuinely interesting

11230.72 --> 11233.039999999999
what you

11236.52 --> 11239.52
do

11251.56 --> 11257.119999999999
a lot of people on the channels you been

11253.96 --> 11259.64
watching last two years okay cool well

11257.12 --> 11262.560000000001
look it it usually requires some talent

11259.64 --> 11262.56
to spot

11266.0 --> 11270.68
Talent if you don't have it you don't

11268.439 --> 11270.68
see

11273.16 --> 11278.76
it which is by the way the universal

11275.88 --> 11281.72
problem with the trolls is that they

11278.76 --> 11284.08
don't have it so they don't see it and

11281.72 --> 11286.599999999999
then they just try to downplay it but

11284.08 --> 11290.16
it's because they don't see it they just

11286.6 --> 11290.16
don't get it as they

11294.04 --> 11301.279
say right they attack it because they

11297.08 --> 11304.0
don't see the quality in it because they

11301.279 --> 11308.0
don't have the quality in them in order

11304.0 --> 11311.16
to recognize the quality in it that's

11308.0 --> 11311.16
unfortunately how that

11315.72 --> 11321.84
works right if you don't have the senses

11318.479 --> 11324.08
to recognize something then it's nothing

11321.84 --> 11324.08
to

11326.2 --> 11331.239000000001
you really real talent in anything is

11328.68 --> 11331.239
magical

11331.92 --> 11337.52
absolutely and it's also kind of

11333.8 --> 11341.56
shocking to realize that if you can see

11337.52 --> 11343.2
the talent that means that you have that

11341.56 --> 11347.399
in

11343.2 --> 11349.04
you which then begs the question like

11347.399 --> 11352.72
what is it that you actually do with

11349.04 --> 11354.800000000001
your talent how is it expressing

11352.72 --> 11359.039999999999
itself which

11354.8 --> 11361.64
is a complicated answer to that question

11359.04 --> 11361.640000000001
a lot of the

11364.92 --> 11369.84
time what I mean to say is that the

11367.399 --> 11372.599999999999
answer to that question is often very

11369.84 --> 11375.8
complicated like how does your talent

11372.6 --> 11377.640000000001
actually manifest itself if you have the

11375.8 --> 11380.119999999999
talent to recognize

11377.64 --> 11382.16
Talent how is your talent actually

11380.12 --> 11384.800000000001
manifesting

11382.16 --> 11386.319
itself the answer to such a question is

11384.8 --> 11389.319
not always

11386.319 --> 11389.319
straightforward

11401.359 --> 11407.880000000001
been known to sling a few guitars around

11405.2 --> 11407.880000000001
okay Gary

11408.12 --> 11411.76
FY all righty

11416.319 --> 11419.319
then

11425.439 --> 11431.0
all right yeah thanks fibro for sharing

11427.92 --> 11433.72
that really appreciate it and keep it up

11431.0 --> 11433.72
man you're doing

11446.239 --> 11449.239
great

11476.239 --> 11483.479
for right but guys yeah I'm not going to

11480.359 --> 11488.439
make a 5 hour show today I really I want

11483.479 --> 11488.438999999998
I'm sorry it's it's too

11488.56 --> 11495.479
much but we have definitely made it past

11492.279 --> 11499.6
the 3our Mark again this it's probably

11495.479 --> 11499.599999999999
going to be like a 3 hour

11499.72 --> 11504.88
and 15 minute show roughly in the

11506.239 --> 11509.239
end

11535.88 --> 11539.96
wow yeah

11538.04 --> 11543.439
yeah they don't get it Richard they

11539.96 --> 11544.438999999998
don't understand that we do actually

11543.439 --> 11548.960000000001
have

11544.439 --> 11552.04
like personal direct contact over Skype

11548.96 --> 11555.438999999998
and you have

11552.04 --> 11558.84
actually criticized me you just you're

11555.439 --> 11558.84
just very careful with

11559.239 --> 11564.039999999999
it I

11560.96 --> 11566.599999999999
mean everybody here has had at some

11564.04 --> 11569.720000000001
point criticism on me it's just that

11566.6 --> 11573.0
when it happens you don't take it like a

11569.72 --> 11576.199999999999
gamma as a sign of like oh I have

11573.0 --> 11580.12
criticism now I can't hold it back well

11576.2 --> 11581.880000000001
that means war then so I'm going to then

11580.12 --> 11584.640000000001
just like instead of just giving

11581.88 --> 11587.08
criticism just throw everything at you

11584.64 --> 11589.72
because I'm certain you're going to be

11587.08 --> 11592.56
my enemy after this point cuz that's how

11589.72 --> 11596.16
a gamma thinks and that's how a gamma

11592.56 --> 11599.039999999999
acts and guess what Richard G not a

11596.16 --> 11603.84
gamma by roads not a

11599.04 --> 11608.68
gamma so they can actually have some

11603.84 --> 11610.0
criticism they just don't declare war

11608.68 --> 11613.16
when that

11610.0 --> 11615.04
happens because that's what a gamma does

11613.16 --> 11618.68
and they're not

11615.04 --> 11618.68
it yeah that's the

11619.399 --> 11625.08
difference just like the April Fool's

11622.64 --> 11629.039999999999
joke

11625.08 --> 11629.039999999999
yeah it's all ridiculous

11633.16 --> 11638.52
it's an account made today though so

11635.239 --> 11638.52
it's not really ail

11641.12 --> 11646.279
fools right but I mean that's it you can

11643.8 --> 11650.88
have criticism it's just that when you

11646.279 --> 11650.880000000001
do you don't have to declare

11652.04 --> 11659.04
war right criticism requires some subtle

11659.56 --> 11664.519999999999
right a criticism is supposedly a

11662.439 --> 11667.720000000001
correction well

11664.52 --> 11670.68
things correction does bring some

11667.72 --> 11671.92
friction so you got to basically be able

11670.68 --> 11674.12
to

11671.92 --> 11678.76
resonate with the one you're having

11674.12 --> 11681.52
criticism on to give them an incentive

11678.76 --> 11684.72
to correct themselves about it doesn't

11681.52 --> 11687.560000000001
mean a bribe but just an incentive like

11684.72 --> 11689.519999999999
criticizing is an art

11687.56 --> 11693.359
if you actually want your criticism to

11689.52 --> 11696.960000000001
change something you have to do it

11693.359 --> 11700.0
tactful tactful means you don't declare

11696.96 --> 11702.599999999999
war and throw everything at them in

11700.0 --> 11705.439
anticipation that the slightest bit of

11702.6 --> 11709.04
criticism will make the other's attitude

11705.439 --> 11711.319
flip around and declare war on you like

11709.04 --> 11711.319000000001
a

11711.84 --> 11719.239
gamma that's the that's the

11715.96 --> 11722.239
difference yeah but I guess that if

11719.239 --> 11724.76
you're a gamma you just can't do

11722.239 --> 11728.359
constructive criticism it doesn't it's

11724.76 --> 11732.239
not part of like what what your ability

11728.359 --> 11734.239
range of possibility is like your

11732.239 --> 11736.8
possibility range just doesn't account

11734.239 --> 11739.039999999999
for constructive criticism criticism

11736.8 --> 11741.759999999998
just means you declare

11739.04 --> 11745.92
war and that's kind of a bit of a

11741.76 --> 11748.92
problem for gamas not for

11745.92 --> 11748.92
me

11754.6 --> 11757.800000000001
I will you ever get

11759.479 --> 11764.16
past yes Richard G I mean I'm

11774.479 --> 11780.76
terrified I mean I know you feel the

11777.359 --> 11783.199
pressure you had to hold back forever

11780.76 --> 11786.319
because as soon as you criticize you

11783.199 --> 11791.239000000001
know it's a declaration of

11786.319 --> 11791.239
war right no I don't think

11793.84 --> 11799.319
so you used to overreact even a few

11797.04 --> 11799.319000000001
months

11801.6 --> 11807.0
ago I do remember that you did have like

11805.04 --> 11809.76
moments where you would criticize or you

11807.0 --> 11812.76
would be agitated about

11809.76 --> 11812.76
my

11813.88 --> 11816.88
agitations

11819.479 --> 11826.599999999999
definitely so you're not a

11823.279 --> 11829.319000000001
siant you're just kind of

11826.6 --> 11830.76
laidback overall but not a siant you

11829.319 --> 11833.88
don't just like

11830.76 --> 11835.76
needlessly compliment just to suck up or

11833.88 --> 11838.92
something like I've never seen you do

11835.76 --> 11843.439
that at all you're just kind of like

11838.92 --> 11848.319
yeah I'll just sit back and just watch

11843.439 --> 11850.399
it sit back and watch that oh it's a an

11848.319 --> 11853.519999999999
opposing opinion oh that's fine I'll

11850.399 --> 11855.439
just sit sit back and just watch that

11853.52 --> 11858.04
that's just how you do it it's not siop

11855.439 --> 11858.04
fantic at

11859.16 --> 11864.88
all I don't even know why they always

11861.68 --> 11864.880000000001
have to bicker about

11865.84 --> 11872.76
you why the trolls always have to

11869.479 --> 11874.358999999999
mention you somehow and how terrible it

11872.76 --> 11877.960000000001
is what you

11874.359 --> 11877.960000000001
do I don't get

11881.199 --> 11886.880000000001
it you don't even want to use the world

11884.8 --> 11890.0
troll

11886.88 --> 11892.319
anymore yeah that is fair enough though

11890.0 --> 11895.6
you're you're actually kind of right

11892.319 --> 11895.6
because a

11895.76 --> 11898.76
troll

11899.96 --> 11903.919999999998
a a real

11901.52 --> 11906.04
troll actually

11903.92 --> 11909.88
has some

11906.04 --> 11913.160000000002
creativity a real troll can find the

11909.88 --> 11917.72
weak spot and have a point make a

11913.16 --> 11920.279
point Like An Inconvenient point that is

11917.72 --> 11920.278999999999
really a

11921.08 --> 11925.72
point that makes the subject

11923.92 --> 11928.72
uncomfortable or

11925.72 --> 11928.72
whatever

11930.52 --> 11933.479000000001
so if they're just not succeeding at

11932.56 --> 11936.56
that at

11933.479 --> 11938.08
all they're not really a troll they're

11936.56 --> 11941.519999999999
like a

11938.08 --> 11944.52
fizzle it's more like a goblin right I

11941.52 --> 11946.84
mean if they're kind of successful you

11944.52 --> 11948.720000000001
should call them probably Trolls but if

11946.84 --> 11952.12
they're like unsuccessful and they're

11948.72 --> 11953.84
just whiny and [ __ ] they're more like

11952.12 --> 11958.399000000001
goblins

11953.84 --> 11960.56
right triel dumb

11958.399 --> 11965.119999999999
annoying

11960.56 --> 11965.119999999999
pathetic I mean a troll can be kind of

11965.239 --> 11971.319
intimidating a troll regenerates when

11967.92 --> 11973.239
you attack them troll can actually be

11971.319 --> 11975.88
dangerous it's like comparing it in Lord

11973.239 --> 11980.279
of the Rings like a troll that's

11975.88 --> 11984.319
actually dangerous but a goblin they're

11980.279 --> 11984.319000000001
pathetic and very easily

11985.64 --> 11990.278999999999
dispatched

11987.68 --> 11993.12
goblins are not cool yeah that's right

11990.279 --> 11993.12
goblins are not

11995.08 --> 12002.96
cool and I mean even like in the in the

11998.8 --> 12005.519999999999
fantasy lar scene goblins are not cool

12002.96 --> 12008.679999999998
people that like to play goblins how do

12005.52 --> 12010.68
they play them like pathetic sniveling

12008.68 --> 12013.319
creatures because that's exactly what

12010.68 --> 12015.64
they are and it's like there is a

12013.319 --> 12018.64
universal consensus about

12015.64 --> 12018.64
that

12031.04 --> 12036.479000000001
I thought they were like an

12033.479 --> 12036.479
elf

12037.399 --> 12041.599999999999
no where the hell are you getting

12045.64 --> 12048.64
that

12055.319 --> 12061.08
wow W some real bit grammar there

12061.6 --> 12066.479000000001
brilliant I think I I triggered some

12064.04 --> 12066.479000000001
people

12068.68 --> 12072.800000000001
again all right but I'm going to run out

12070.84 --> 12075.56
the show I I could just try to make fun

12072.8 --> 12078.358999999999
of just a bunch of [ __ ] here

12075.56 --> 12080.56
but it's a waste of time I don't want to

12078.359 --> 12080.56
do

12100.359 --> 12109.0
it yeah no but I'm not a gamma with

12104.08 --> 12111.12
criticism I'm just I'm just a

12109.0 --> 12116.8
perfectionist I am an

12111.12 --> 12117.880000000001
elf and I know how to shoot like Legolas

12116.8 --> 12120.479
so I'm

12117.88 --> 12121.92
like yeah I know they're just goblins

12120.479 --> 12124.56
and they're just sitting there in the

12121.92 --> 12128.52
background trying to shoot arrows at me

12124.56 --> 12131.319
but they're not really a threat but I

12128.52 --> 12135.04
just don't want it to be there because I

12131.319 --> 12135.039999999999
don't like ugliness I'm just going

12135.52 --> 12141.399000000001
to shoot them off because I

12141.92 --> 12148.359
can right and besides there's actual

12145.479 --> 12150.84
criticism that that has a point or that

12148.359 --> 12154.76
has any kind of argument at

12150.84 --> 12158.439
all I actually do address

12154.76 --> 12162.76
it unless it's the same dumb already

12158.439 --> 12162.76
addressed recycled [ __ ] over and over

12163.239 --> 12170.6
again there's no point in re addressing

12167.08 --> 12170.6
the same thing over and over

12175.88 --> 12183.039999999999
again

12178.68 --> 12186.16
right but I mean seriously like if you

12183.04 --> 12187.479000000001
compare these these goblins that keep

12186.16 --> 12191.0
doing

12187.479 --> 12195.08
this and then think about Greta Thunder

12191.0 --> 12198.319
tub Thunder thunderberg sorry I

12195.08 --> 12201.16
mean you got realize that Greta is like

12198.319 --> 12203.278999999999
way better than that right and I bet

12201.16 --> 12204.53
that Greta gets like her own goblins

12203.279 --> 12206.08
that are continually

12204.53 --> 12209.279
[Music]

12206.08 --> 12212.239
whining and I'm like really if you

12209.279 --> 12214.319000000001
compare it like she can't be that bad

12212.239 --> 12217.119999999999
even though she's like on the wrong side

12214.319 --> 12220.119999999999
of the argument basically and the wrong

12217.12 --> 12223.479000000001
Camp obviously on the wrong

12220.12 --> 12225.960000000001
side but she can't be that

12223.479 --> 12229.599999999999
bad like I don't think that she'd

12225.96 --> 12232.239
actually waste her time just like

12229.6 --> 12236.399000000001
trolling other people's

12232.239 --> 12236.399
streams like she wouldn't be doing

12239.08 --> 12247.96
that just just saying that yeah Greta is

12244.52 --> 12249.76
probably better of a person than these

12247.96 --> 12252.88
people that these goblins that keep

12249.76 --> 12255.84
inserting themselves in my chat Ju Just

12252.88 --> 12258.358999999999
wanted to emphasize that that she's

12255.84 --> 12258.359
better than

12259.92 --> 12267.319
you regardless of uh the overall

12264.319 --> 12267.319
situation

12274.92 --> 12279.8
right right because sometimes somebody

12277.56 --> 12282.76
can be on the wrong

12279.8 --> 12287.239
side of an argument or the wrong side of

12282.76 --> 12289.6
a war but they can then still because of

12287.239 --> 12293.399
how they do what they do they can still

12289.6 --> 12296.68
be better than somebody

12293.399 --> 12302.68
that's on the right side of an argument

12296.68 --> 12302.68
or a war but doing it it all

12304.04 --> 12310.800000000001
wrong you know cuz how you do something

12308.359 --> 12310.800000000001
also

12315.319 --> 12318.319
