96.84 --> 103.07900000000001
it's kind of a a gray soup up there but

100.14 --> 105.659
not super thick or anything and all this

103.079 --> 108.32
snow has completely melted

105.659 --> 108.32000000000001
overnight

108.42 --> 114.06
doesn't seem to be wind

112.02 --> 116.65899999999999
and it feels like it's still water cold

114.06 --> 116.659
out there

121.439 --> 124.15899999999999
right

126.979 --> 132.899
I'll check the weather move away hmm

135.72 --> 141.5
hello tarot 306 first in chat good to

139.26 --> 141.5
see you

142.2 --> 149.7
it is Tuesday the 24th of January 2023

150.36 --> 153.14000000000001
ah

155.76 --> 161.599
I'm starting a bit late because yeah I I

158.4 --> 161.59900000000002
got up a bit late

162.84 --> 166.459
hello tensor good to see you

167.94 --> 171.48
cause yeah I just had a really good

169.62 --> 174.239
sleep and

171.48 --> 175.67999999999998
I don't know was it was really cold I

174.239 --> 178.14000000000001
mean I sleep with

175.68 --> 180.54000000000002
basically with the window open

178.14 --> 182.45899999999997
and the radiator off because I don't

180.54 --> 185.22
want to waste all that heat

182.459 --> 188.28
and it does get really cold in his room

185.22 --> 190.68
at night but I I really need the fresh

188.28 --> 193.14000000000001
air it's more important than

190.68 --> 196.76000000000002
that maybe my face

193.14 --> 196.76
doesn't get cold or anything

197.3 --> 202.8
but yeah in the mornings that makes it

200.28 --> 203.819
like a little extra tough to get out of

202.8 --> 206.34
it

203.819 --> 209.54
anyway I was just sleeping well

206.34 --> 209.54
and enjoying it

210.42 --> 212.89999999999998
right

213.0 --> 215.78
uh

215.94 --> 220.099
don't have a ready subject today

221.819 --> 226.5
I thought that maybe I could deserve a

224.04 --> 229.2
little bit of a break after just a very

226.5 --> 235.28
intense show yesterday

229.2 --> 235.28
as in very focused on on a subject

235.68 --> 238.28
uh

240.54 --> 245.84
that it snows for about a week in the

243.659 --> 247.79899999999998
Netherlands

245.84 --> 250.799
uh

247.799 --> 253.62
well not where I've been at there I mean

250.799 --> 257.299
this it only snowed like one

253.62 --> 257.299
one night and morning here

259.019 --> 265.52
but yeah it stayed frozen it didn't melt

262.74 --> 265.52
until today

267.36 --> 271.34000000000003
but I don't know the winter's not over

269.1 --> 271.34000000000003
yet

274.139 --> 280.639
hey Dr Bass awkwards

277.68 --> 280.639
see you man

286.8 --> 291.3
right so yeah yes I had my yesterday's

289.38 --> 293.9
show my parents attracted a whole bunch

291.3 --> 293.90000000000003
of trolls

297.3 --> 303.6
they didn't like it at all

299.58 --> 306.0
so yeah I had to like sweep up my

303.6 --> 309.06
comment section for a bit because it was

306.0 --> 312.06
just filled with garbage

309.06 --> 312.06
foreign

314.84 --> 318.44
buggy good to see you

335.4 --> 339.979
cannot wait till spring oh you're gonna

337.56 --> 339.979
have to

344.759 --> 352.259
controls really Hammer your channel yeah

348.0 --> 354.84
it's also because in relation I get very

352.259 --> 358.259
few other comments

354.84 --> 360.71999999999997
and I still do get them sometimes

358.259 --> 363.36
and they're really good I definitely

360.72 --> 364.56
keep those around but yeah the trolls

363.36 --> 366.84000000000003
really do

364.56 --> 369.96
come by more frequently I mean their

366.84 --> 372.419
insults are just so pure at home at this

369.96 --> 375.32
point it's really just it's just a

372.419 --> 375.32
nuisance I mean

377.759 --> 383.6
they're just blowing hot air it doesn't

380.34 --> 383.59999999999997
have any grip at all

384.479 --> 388.94
it's just dirt in the way

388.979 --> 394.68
right but yeah the more useless it is

392.1 --> 397.62
the more easily for me it's just swept

394.68 --> 399.78000000000003
away I mean if if the comment actually

397.62 --> 403.319
had some kind of a point then I'd be

399.78 --> 407.84
much less inclined to remove it

403.319 --> 409.639
even if you seem a little trollish

407.84 --> 413.09999999999997
foreign

409.639 --> 415.919
if you have some set of complaints but

413.1 --> 418.62
you can also actually prove that you get

415.919 --> 420.9
what I'm talking about or can point out

418.62 --> 423.9
things about what I was saying that are

420.9 --> 427.38
actually valuable

423.9 --> 430.19899999999996
the actual valuable Parts not just some

427.38 --> 432.65999999999997
one little habit or something

430.199 --> 435.06
but the actual subject related of what

432.66 --> 437.84000000000003
I'm talking about well then becomes a

435.06 --> 437.84
whole different story

441.96 --> 450.12
it's all about attitude versus content

447.06 --> 451.259
and if you have no content if you can if

450.12 --> 454.259
you're improving you don't understand

451.259 --> 457.8
the subject you're not even addressing a

454.259 --> 461.699
subject it's just attitude well then

457.8 --> 464.18
it's useless and I throw it away

461.699 --> 464.18
anyway

473.94 --> 478.819
new eye contact app that's bizarre

485.16 --> 487.46000000000004
foreign

493.639 --> 498.78000000000003
trolls have tough time to get to get

496.919 --> 501.0
back

498.78 --> 504.08
but it's like literally I literally

501.0 --> 504.08
spell it all out

504.66 --> 509.58000000000004
and it's not even like I'm telling it in

507.36 --> 512.399
such a unique twist although yeah Spirit

509.58 --> 515.039
mechanics yeah I do there's not somebody

512.399 --> 518.06
else that really talks it about it like

515.039 --> 518.06
that like I do

518.3 --> 523.3199999999999
approaching Maybe

520.86 --> 526.2
but like when I do like physics

523.32 --> 528.6
explanations I mean that is not like oh

526.2 --> 530.94
I really give it a unique twist in the

528.6 --> 534.0600000000001
way I explain it no I explain it exactly

530.94 --> 537.019
how it is typically explained

534.06 --> 537.0189999999999
all those things

538.5 --> 546.36
there's no reason yeah to not

543.839 --> 548.7
to not get that like there isn't any

546.36 --> 550.98
reason like even for a baller right and

548.7 --> 552.6600000000001
that's why Ballers here in chat when

550.98 --> 554.4590000000001
they do come around and yes there was

552.66 --> 557.16
plenty of them

554.459 --> 559.8
they do they actually do follow right

557.16 --> 561.7199999999999
they might not agree but they at least

559.8 --> 565.8599999999999
get it right

561.72 --> 569.0400000000001
yeah I got a lot of things back in the

565.86 --> 571.62
day that I did not agree with or that I

569.04 --> 574.38
did not even know yet whether I agreed

571.62 --> 576.42
or not but I would still get it I would

574.38 --> 580.16
have still be able to feed it back and

576.42 --> 580.16
like lay down

580.2 --> 586.38
why it's there what it's used for ETC

583.08 --> 588.779
right I could I got things it's just

586.38 --> 590.399
that I didn't agree so there's no that's

588.779 --> 591.72
not an excuse it's just because you

590.399 --> 595.5
don't agree

591.72 --> 596.76
it's not an excuse for not being able to

595.5 --> 598.86
get it

596.76 --> 600.959
it's more like a camouflage isn't it

598.86 --> 602.7
it's just an attitude camouflage just a

600.959 --> 605.16
mask

602.7 --> 606.48
that you are actually incompetent very

605.16 --> 609.679
typical

606.48 --> 609.679
[Music]

609.899 --> 612.5
anyway

614.7 --> 620.339
I have a quick video if you want me to

618.06 --> 623.3389999999999
post it that depends

620.339 --> 626.399
what about I mean yeah sure you can post

623.339 --> 628.5
links people do that here if you have a

626.399 --> 630.899
wrench and you do slow mo moon buggy but

628.5 --> 634.019
would be nice before you just dump

630.899 --> 636.86
something to say what it is

634.019 --> 636.86
at least

645.779 --> 649.8
okay turret well I'm glad you're so

648.48 --> 652.5
amused

649.8 --> 655.92
by their actions I just find them

652.5 --> 658.2
a nuisance really I'm not enjoying it as

655.92 --> 660.66
much as you seem to

658.2 --> 664.82
about the eye contact up okay yeah sure

660.66 --> 664.8199999999999
slow moong buggy press the link

674.339 --> 682.129
oh YouTube shorts okay

678.46 --> 682.129
[Music]

686.399 --> 691.9
with an ad

688.67 --> 691.9
[Music]

692.16 --> 695.66
oh that is a really short

700.22 --> 707.4590000000001
wow that is the app

703.86 --> 710.339
that looks [Â __Â ] that looks really

707.459 --> 712.68
really ugly

710.339 --> 714.12
oh my God

712.68 --> 716.2199999999999
yes

714.12 --> 718.86
there's no way in hell i'll ever use

716.22 --> 720.779
that I mean look at those dead eyes I

718.86 --> 722.1
mean you could literally see it like

720.779 --> 724.2
robots

722.1 --> 728.48
like

724.2 --> 728.48
the digital is written all over it

731.64 --> 737.899
it's like literally I just

734.459 --> 742.38
three seconds of that and it's like

737.899 --> 744.3
yeah that doesn't work for me at all

742.38 --> 746.7
foreign

744.3 --> 748.4399999999999
I'd rather have somebody just seeing

746.7 --> 750.9590000000001
looking down when they're reading

748.44 --> 755.36
something I have that looks

750.959 --> 755.3599999999999
natural more natural than this

756.54 --> 765.1999999999999
that guy Josh the last bit might use it

762.6 --> 765.2
Maybe

775.26 --> 780.5
but I don't know I did actually just see

777.72 --> 780.5
him look down

781.56 --> 788.04
so maybe it's he has it on like a push

785.16 --> 790.92
it's like okay sit still I gotta read

788.04 --> 792.959
something now and then you push it like

790.92 --> 794.88
make a snapshot and basically you could

792.959 --> 797.459
do it as simple as that you know if you

794.88 --> 799.82
just sit still are winning level still

797.459 --> 799.8199999999999
remember

805.8 --> 810.0
and then you just click

808.079 --> 811.9799999999999
and then it just stays like that it's

810.0 --> 815.779
just a snapshot right then you could

811.98 --> 815.779
like do whatever even leave

815.94 --> 821.1
or read something like intensely and

818.639 --> 823.5600000000001
then just go back to that same

821.1 --> 825.1800000000001
moment and just click release and then

823.56 --> 828.4799999999999
it will just look like it was a

825.18 --> 830.8199999999999
temporary like camera freeze glitch or

828.48 --> 834.0600000000001
something right nobody would notice why

830.82 --> 836.0400000000001
would you use a program that CGI your

834.06 --> 838.8
eyes to look straightforward I mean

836.04 --> 841.8
ridiculous

838.8 --> 841.8
ridiculous

842.59 --> 847.139
[Music]

844.56 --> 849.0
push to share now it would be push to

847.139 --> 853.62
freeze basically

849.0 --> 856.8
right you get the right like a typical

853.62 --> 859.2
position in which you would sit still

856.8 --> 861.42
and then you click

859.2 --> 863.5790000000001
and then it basically stays Frozen that

861.42 --> 865.5
you can do whatever you want for a bit

863.579 --> 866.8199999999999
no not too long that would be really

865.5 --> 868.44
weird

866.82 --> 870.5400000000001
and then you click again and it's

868.44 --> 872.94
released and you don't necessarily even

870.54 --> 875.76
have to sit in this in another

872.94 --> 877.2
way other Po in in the same pose you

875.76 --> 879.12
could sit in another post and it would

877.2 --> 883.1
just look like oh wow your camera froze

879.12 --> 883.1
for a bit there right I mean

883.32 --> 890.82
yeah that might not work like on a news

886.38 --> 892.139
show like on the to news program

890.82 --> 894.779
right

892.139 --> 899.04
but like on any web stream that's a very

894.779 --> 902.959
like very easily be implemented

899.04 --> 902.959
and nobody would really catch on

904.92 --> 909.8
push the stair and adag yeah a bit

910.32 --> 914.72
and hello jedo good to see you

916.38 --> 923.3
with such Innovations help Mass actors

919.199 --> 923.3
ride well they already have dead eyes so

926.79 --> 932.01
[Music]

934.62 --> 938.3
but okay I guess yeah

938.399 --> 941.959
things people develop right

942.48 --> 946.44
[Music]

944.04 --> 949.56
for some people especially that when

946.44 --> 953.399
they're relatively new to acting and

949.56 --> 956.04
their typical readers read at Red actors

953.399 --> 957.839
they need a prompter

956.04 --> 959.88
well for them

957.839 --> 961.0790000000001
yeah this could be

959.88 --> 965.399
uh

961.079 --> 966.8389999999999
a solution at least at the start

965.399 --> 968.699
right when they're still like really

966.839 --> 971.1600000000001
like oh [Â __Â ] what was I supposed to say

968.699 --> 975.079
right when they really have to keep

971.16 --> 975.079
looking at that card all the time

976.32 --> 981.6
because when you do that by the way with

979.38 --> 983.639
people that do that I don't do that but

981.6 --> 986.639
when you do that eventually

983.639 --> 988.26
it's just like one you just see it as an

986.639 --> 990.839
icon and you just have to get one

988.26 --> 992.1
Glimpse and then you basically replace

990.839 --> 994.139
everything

992.1 --> 996.5400000000001
in your mind again

994.139 --> 999.839
you don't have to keep reading it or

996.54 --> 1002.42
staring at it right but at the start a

999.839 --> 1006.44
lot of the times people that go and

1002.42 --> 1008.36
learn do to do that they end up like

1006.44 --> 1010.6990000000001
with like focus problems and then like

1008.36 --> 1012.32
have to stare more at it to get through

1010.699 --> 1015.139
get it through to them

1012.32 --> 1018.88
and yeah well it could help to kind of

1015.139 --> 1018.88
mask that period I guess

1021.139 --> 1026.36
right

1023.12 --> 1032.36
but me personally I would basically fix

1026.36 --> 1032.36
it with a with a push to freeze system

1035.179 --> 1040.3600000000001
do you ever do acting when you were

1037.52 --> 1040.36
younger yeah

1040.699 --> 1044.0790000000002
I really like that actually

1048.14 --> 1052.88
we did it like in a Waldorf School we

1050.96 --> 1054.74
did a play I will never forget that

1052.88 --> 1057.38
because it was really like a special

1054.74 --> 1060.38
moment in ways

1057.38 --> 1060.38
ah

1060.62 --> 1067.34
we had a play of Robin Hood and it was

1064.039 --> 1069.74
really kind of a real stage

1067.34 --> 1071.299
spoken type play it was all English by

1069.74 --> 1072.86
the way and I played the Sheriff of

1071.299 --> 1075.86
Nottingham

1072.86 --> 1078.9189999999999
and I had a real sword the rest had a

1075.86 --> 1082.6999999999998
bunch of wood swords I had like a real

1078.919 --> 1085.3600000000001
like Renaissance Blade with with like

1082.7 --> 1089.24
the curve the hand protection

1085.36 --> 1091.52
it's not like a an act yeah a Rapier but

1089.24 --> 1095.08
not like a

1091.52 --> 1098.48
like for fencing not that type of Rapier

1095.08 --> 1102.02
but a blade type Rapier

1098.48 --> 1104.0
which yeah my parents had that and I was

1102.02 --> 1106.4
allowed to use that

1104.0 --> 1108.679
like on stage even and cheesed it and

1106.4 --> 1113.1200000000001
just banged it against their stick

1108.679 --> 1115.22
swords and that was really epic people

1113.12 --> 1117.62
were like a bit nervous when that

1115.22 --> 1120.32
happened when they heard like actual

1117.62 --> 1122.2399999999998
metal and she they were like a bit

1120.32 --> 1125.48
because it was like an action moment

1122.24 --> 1128.0
where suddenly battle broke out

1125.48 --> 1130.4
I'll never forget that I mean it was all

1128.0 --> 1132.62
super impressive to me and I got to be

1130.4 --> 1135.14
like a badass

1132.62 --> 1136.9399999999998
and activate intimidating and that

1135.14 --> 1138.3400000000001
literally everybody would have to play

1136.94 --> 1141.6200000000001
along with it

1138.34 --> 1144.3799999999999
which in real life they never would

1141.62 --> 1146.4799999999998
uh so yeah I mean

1144.38 --> 1148.88
and before that too

1146.48 --> 1151.94
like in another school there was like a

1148.88 --> 1154.16
weekly do something on a stage thing

1151.94 --> 1157.8400000000001
whatever

1154.16 --> 1161.179
and I like to do things there too

1157.84 --> 1163.6399999999999
basically like

1161.179 --> 1167.3200000000002
sort of just tell stories of what I was

1163.64 --> 1167.3200000000002
thinking about and what I liked

1169.28 --> 1173.8999999999999
so it would have probably been like

1171.44 --> 1176.66
about Legos and about

1173.9 --> 1179.0
spaceships

1176.66 --> 1181.4
or something

1179.0 --> 1185.72
or maybe like

1181.4 --> 1187.7
fairies from a magic Realm which or else

1185.72 --> 1190.28
from Lord of the something like that I

1187.7 --> 1192.799
was into all those things a lot right

1190.28 --> 1193.8799999999999
but yeah that's not really acting it's

1192.799 --> 1196.58
just

1193.88 --> 1197.9
in front of an audience just sharing

1196.58 --> 1200.12
stuff

1197.9 --> 1202.6000000000001
right but yeah I was a bit into school

1200.12 --> 1202.6
plays

1203.36 --> 1208.4599999999998
I I never went as far as to like join a

1206.48 --> 1211.039
drama club or anything

1208.46 --> 1213.08
and it wasn't that like

1211.039 --> 1216.08
urgent like oh I need to act it wasn't

1213.08 --> 1219.5
like that

1216.08 --> 1222.02
but I can do it and

1219.5 --> 1223.94
it was very innovating when I would do

1222.02 --> 1225.679
it it's just not something that oh I

1223.94 --> 1229.96
wanted back I need to get back on that

1225.679 --> 1229.96
stage I never had it like that

1231.02 --> 1233.799
anyway

1240.74 --> 1244.539
hey steamy traveler good to see you

1273.679 --> 1279.52
as you can start water

1276.02 --> 1279.52
enter stage left

1285.559 --> 1292.24
right well that Walter school we were at

1287.9 --> 1292.24
did have like an actual proper stage

1293.299 --> 1299.679
like it was really a theater stage

1297.14 --> 1302.659
and a room for it like a really big room

1299.679 --> 1306.44
and there was but it was like a theater

1302.659 --> 1307.94
room basically all of it but also used

1306.44 --> 1311.72
for other

1307.94 --> 1314.24
things like a red me like the sort of

1311.72 --> 1318.02
weird Rudolph Steiner ballot

1314.24 --> 1320.78
or what do you call ballet

1318.02 --> 1323.0
so other stuff was done in that place

1320.78 --> 1325.34
too but it was also basically the

1323.0 --> 1328.539
theater room with a really

1325.34 --> 1328.539
elaborate stage

1337.02 --> 1340.569
[Music]

1341.659 --> 1347.419
I mean that place is like really sealed

1344.84 --> 1349.76
within my memory

1347.419 --> 1351.7990000000002
because that was a magical place to a

1349.76 --> 1353.6589999999999
lot of people people like because you

1351.799 --> 1356.4189999999999
weren't allowed in that room normally

1353.659 --> 1358.64
unless there was an activity but it

1356.419 --> 1360.14
would was like the most exciting thing

1358.64 --> 1362.659
ever

1360.14 --> 1365.419
to like sneak in there

1362.659 --> 1367.2800000000002
and like explore the place like we would

1365.419 --> 1368.8400000000001
try to get under the stage because

1367.28 --> 1370.46
nobody would ever get there and it's

1368.84 --> 1373.039
like what is there

1370.46 --> 1377.6200000000001
what is under there

1373.039 --> 1377.62
right is pure curiosity

1399.62 --> 1403.8799999999999
right but it it was almost yeah that

1401.96 --> 1405.799
thing is like a cat Instinct right it's

1403.88 --> 1408.98
like oh new territory you want to

1405.799 --> 1411.559
explore it well we were like only really

1408.98 --> 1413.84
LED in there under guidance and then you

1411.559 --> 1416.8999999999999
couldn't just go everywhere

1413.84 --> 1419.12
and that made it like it like this the

1416.9 --> 1423.5590000000002
Curiosity was like painful because of

1419.12 --> 1426.4399999999998
that with me and some other guys to

1423.559 --> 1429.559
girls not so much

1426.44 --> 1432.38
but a lot of guys definitely and they

1429.559 --> 1435.32
were like we have to know what is there

1432.38 --> 1439.64
why aren't we ever allowed to just roam

1435.32 --> 1442.1
free there we had to find out

1439.64 --> 1443.6000000000001
uh

1442.1 --> 1446.9599999999998
[Music]

1443.6 --> 1449.6589999999999
Green Room no

1446.96 --> 1451.7
no there was a green room

1449.659 --> 1456.5590000000002
and there was a whole garden and that's

1451.7 --> 1461.26
another location now this was all indoor

1456.559 --> 1461.26
and they didn't do any secret [Â __Â ]

1465.86 --> 1473.6
like no drugs no alcohol

1469.34 --> 1475.28
nothing and like absolutely zero zero of

1473.6 --> 1477.62
that

1475.28 --> 1480.86
right and that includes for the teachers

1477.62 --> 1483.6789999999999
and they were like really really strict

1480.86 --> 1485.8999999999999
on that with the teachers even so but

1483.679 --> 1487.4
kids would never even like try that or

1485.9 --> 1489.5800000000002
anything they'd be out of the school

1487.4 --> 1493.4
immediately

1489.58 --> 1495.02
like I did all kinds of crazy

1493.4 --> 1498.26
things

1495.02 --> 1501.08
climbing on the roof Can't and

1498.26 --> 1504.919
like I actually was crazy enough at some

1501.08 --> 1506.8999999999999
point was really just manic

1504.919 --> 1509.659
where I had like a face where I was

1506.9 --> 1511.1000000000001
super pyromantic and I one time I

1509.659 --> 1514.46
literally just

1511.1 --> 1517.6999999999998
it's really embarrassing

1514.46 --> 1523.1000000000001
one time I literally stole gasoline out

1517.7 --> 1526.039
of like a a scooter tank from like the

1523.1 --> 1528.86
high schooler which that school was

1526.039 --> 1531.5
right next to it just to basically sort

1528.86 --> 1533.4399999999998
of make fireballs with like a spray

1531.5 --> 1536.6
bottle

1533.44 --> 1539.0
totally insane right but that's like as

1536.6 --> 1542.6589999999999
far as I would go like alcohol

1539.0 --> 1544.52
like what the [Â __Â ] is alcohol who cares

1542.659 --> 1549.159
drugs no way

1544.52 --> 1549.1589999999999
like I was freaking High just being me

1551.059 --> 1556.1589999999999
but yeah I did other crazy stuff that

1554.0 --> 1558.98
they did not appreciate but I managed to

1556.159 --> 1561.0800000000002
not get kicked out of the school though

1558.98 --> 1565.58
they just thought like I get a little

1561.08 --> 1568.9399999999998
crazy sometimes sometimes I like just

1565.58 --> 1572.48
something some dream snaps in my head

1568.94 --> 1574.1000000000001
and had just go off and do like I don't

1572.48 --> 1576.08
see

1574.1 --> 1578.059
what I'm not supposed to do anymore I

1576.08 --> 1579.799
just don't I didn't see it anymore and

1578.059 --> 1582.2
it just would do stuff

1579.799 --> 1585.1399999999999
Mania

1582.2 --> 1588.2
and that it wasn't like some that a con

1585.14 --> 1590.1200000000001
it wasn't me making a stand as a rebel

1588.2 --> 1593.659
against the school it was just me

1590.12 --> 1596.36
getting so inspired I couldn't stop

1593.659 --> 1598.3400000000001
and so they were like okay well you're

1596.36 --> 1602.1789999999999
not trying to undermine our Authority at

1598.34 --> 1603.1699999999998
least so just please get that under

1602.179 --> 1604.64
control

1603.17 --> 1606.94
[Music]

1604.64 --> 1610.72
yeah

1606.94 --> 1613.52
so yeah the the teachers they were very

1610.72 --> 1616.7
high level Sharp

1613.52 --> 1618.86
they they did actually treat us as full

1616.7 --> 1620.3700000000001
psychological individuals and

1618.86 --> 1621.86
intelligent ones

1620.37 --> 1624.1999999999998
[Music]

1621.86 --> 1626.84
and that was really helpful

1624.2 --> 1629.3600000000001
that the teachers were relative to most

1626.84 --> 1632.059
schools I've been at extremely

1629.36 --> 1634.279
proficient because they could really

1632.059 --> 1636.2
function on a high level psychologically

1634.279 --> 1639.919
and spiritually

1636.2 --> 1643.8400000000001
beyond my understanding at the time

1639.919 --> 1643.8400000000001
and just deal with it

1647.299 --> 1652.94
anyway

1649.7 --> 1657.279
do I keep in touch with any of my any

1652.94 --> 1657.279
friends you say that's funny

1658.159 --> 1662.24
there's really only one guy there that I

1660.559 --> 1665.8999999999999
would consider a friend

1662.24 --> 1669.32
and he is a sailor

1665.9 --> 1671.779
like he is like a fisherman or something

1669.32 --> 1673.76
so

1671.779 --> 1677.5
I don't think he's been like to the

1673.76 --> 1677.5
Netherlands in like two decades

1682.46 --> 1687.8600000000001
like his mother was a shaman by the way

1684.799 --> 1690.5
very fascinating that's the first actual

1687.86 --> 1694.58
Shaman in function that I've

1690.5 --> 1696.2
got in contact with that really did also

1694.58 --> 1699.3999999999999
because I didn't even know at the time

1696.2 --> 1699.4
my mother told me

1699.62 --> 1703.039
like

1700.88 --> 1705.5590000000002
after they had some interactions about

1703.039 --> 1708.2
that and that really got me so

1705.559 --> 1711.74
fascinated like with Shamanism like what

1708.2 --> 1713.48
is that what are you seeing like

1711.74 --> 1717.14
because they would

1713.48 --> 1720.38
start to address like a tone which I

1717.14 --> 1722.419
don't that that lady like certain types

1720.38 --> 1724.1000000000001
of people just talk in a tone where I

1722.419 --> 1728.1200000000001
know like

1724.1 --> 1730.76
I almost become reminded of well like

1728.12 --> 1733.279
Dark World Vision stuff like that I

1730.76 --> 1735.08
never talk about I can never connect it

1733.279 --> 1737.0
and suddenly people start talking in a

1735.08 --> 1739.0
way and then it is just like wait I

1737.0 --> 1741.86
could potentially

1739.0 --> 1744.32
reflect these experiences to those

1741.86 --> 1745.6399999999999
people and they might understand it they

1744.32 --> 1748.059
might actually know what the [Â __Â ]

1745.64 --> 1748.0590000000002
going on

1752.6 --> 1758.1399999999999
but yeah I haven't been in contact with

1755.9 --> 1758.14
them

1759.62 --> 1764.0
right there's all kinds of weird

1761.179 --> 1769.039
experiences I had in that school I mean

1764.0 --> 1771.799
like we had a really nice teacher lady

1769.039 --> 1775.12
like my first I was there in this school

1771.799 --> 1775.12
a total of

1777.26 --> 1783.74
three years but my God like it's it

1781.88 --> 1786.98
feels like it was 10.

1783.74 --> 1790.46
because so much happened there so much

1786.98 --> 1793.88
right but including that well the

1790.46 --> 1795.799
teacher we had a really nice lady like I

1793.88 --> 1796.88
was a little bit sort of in love with

1795.799 --> 1798.98
her and

1796.88 --> 1801.74
I kept it stoic

1798.98 --> 1804.32
because she was so nice and careful and

1801.74 --> 1808.24
sensitive but yeah she died of cancer

1804.32 --> 1808.24
later really terrible

1809.299 --> 1813.5
but there was another replacement

1810.98 --> 1815.179
teacher in the last year who was

1813.5 --> 1819.14
freaking awesome

1815.179 --> 1822.02
he was a hyperactive guy

1819.14 --> 1826.46
that was kind of eccentric

1822.02 --> 1829.82
but really like he had that male power

1826.46 --> 1833.8400000000001
of like honor he had like that male

1829.82 --> 1835.9399999999998
honor strength which is something I have

1833.84 --> 1839.059
and I before I met that guy I'd never

1835.94 --> 1842.539
been able to actually reflect upon that

1839.059 --> 1844.6399999999999
part and he also

1842.539 --> 1847.64
behind the scenes

1844.64 --> 1849.26
told me about Flat Earth one time

1847.64 --> 1852.5
and about

1849.26 --> 1854.6589999999999
those that oppose them

1852.5 --> 1857.0
he had a whole view on that like there's

1854.659 --> 1859.8200000000002
people that are literally

1857.0 --> 1861.26
pushing that on us and they are

1859.82 --> 1864.799
like

1861.26 --> 1866.84
the enemy of free Humanity basically

1864.799 --> 1869.6589999999999
attract to enslave us with our mind with

1866.84 --> 1872.1789999999999
that and it's like super astounded by

1869.659 --> 1874.279
that and I actually said like to him

1872.179 --> 1876.74
back then and then I forgot about it

1874.279 --> 1879.82
again but I remembered it later

1876.74 --> 1879.82
like it was

1880.039 --> 1885.44
like

1881.36 --> 1889.84
eight or nine nine I was nine I think

1885.44 --> 1889.8400000000001
or no wait probably 10.

1889.88 --> 1896.419
and I told him like yeah

1892.96 --> 1899.1200000000001
it's this is what I'm gonna do like

1896.419 --> 1900.98
where I'm go in the future when I'm

1899.12 --> 1905.0
ready I'm going to

1900.98 --> 1907.46
like really fight the lies and just

1905.0 --> 1909.44
like because he didn't think it could be

1907.46 --> 1912.98
defeated and he was kind of depressed

1909.44 --> 1915.3200000000002
about it when the subject came up I told

1912.98 --> 1917.08
him like no no

1915.32 --> 1920.6589999999999
there's all kinds of things coming

1917.08 --> 1922.58
Technologies and it's going to change

1920.659 --> 1926.0590000000002
everything

1922.58 --> 1931.779
and then we can

1926.059 --> 1931.779
actually just open up about this

1932.059 --> 1936.9189999999999
so like a message of freedom

1934.7 --> 1938.96
and that's and that's like that's like

1936.919 --> 1942.0800000000002
one of those weird Oracle moments right

1938.96 --> 1945.2
because I barely knew anything about it

1942.08 --> 1948.3799999999999
but in that moment because he took me

1945.2 --> 1949.7
with him in his journey of his inner

1948.38 --> 1952.3990000000001
struggle

1949.7 --> 1955.88
that he kept secret most of the time

1952.399 --> 1957.08
I suddenly like got all that energy and

1955.88 --> 1961.88
just

1957.08 --> 1963.6789999999999
was able to like look into the future

1961.88 --> 1967.3400000000001
right then

1963.679 --> 1970.279
something I had not done before

1967.34 --> 1974.36
like because that subject was never

1970.279 --> 1976.82
discussed to me in that way and suddenly

1974.36 --> 1978.5
I saw these things like this is what's

1976.82 --> 1979.7
gonna happen

1978.5 --> 1982.94
like

1979.7 --> 1984.38
it's good like it's not gonna all be

1982.94 --> 1987.559
extinguished

1984.38 --> 1989.72
it's actually gonna Bloom up and spread

1987.559 --> 1991.7
more than it is ever before

1989.72 --> 1994.64
and look at where we are now my

1991.7 --> 1996.679
prediction from

1994.64 --> 1999.919
what is it

1996.679 --> 2002.8200000000002
32 years ago or so

1999.919 --> 2002.8200000000002
has come true

2005.08 --> 2008.08
anyway

2011.44 --> 2017.22
but no I don't really

2013.899 --> 2017.2199999999998
keep in touch with them

2019.0 --> 2023.919
last time I visited was like I visited

2022.179 --> 2025.179
the school because I was sort of in the

2023.919 --> 2028.26
neighborhood and I just wanted to check

2025.179 --> 2031.419
it out and that was like in

2028.26 --> 2034.779
2014 I think

2031.419 --> 2037.1200000000001
but like everything changed like

2034.779 --> 2039.64
when I was there it was literally

2037.12 --> 2041.62
surrounded by Forest

2039.64 --> 2044.38
was amazing

2041.62 --> 2047.9799999999998
now there's basically a highway right

2044.38 --> 2050.32
there or like a more provincial Road and

2047.98 --> 2052.78
of course all gone

2050.32 --> 2055.599
and they built like a hedge

2052.78 --> 2058.0
so it's almost I didn't recognize it

2055.599 --> 2060.54
anymore I wasn't sure it was even

2058.0 --> 2060.54
it

2074.619 --> 2080.5
doesn't help I don't know why

2077.2 --> 2083.08
I don't really keep track

2080.5 --> 2084.639
I mean I am technically subscribed to

2083.08 --> 2086.379
him and

2084.639 --> 2089.379
I don't know I check it out I haven't

2086.379 --> 2092.58
seen any live streams of Jose's

2089.379 --> 2092.58

2106.89 --> 2110.1
[Music]

2114.339 --> 2121.48
hope you're all entertained and

2117.28 --> 2124.96
probably pulled you in pretty deeply

2121.48 --> 2128.579
reflecting on those very detailed

2124.96 --> 2128.579
experiences from my past

2130.96 --> 2135.119
maybe you had moments like that as well

2139.0 --> 2143.98
right or you're just going about and

2142.359 --> 2147.5789999999997
suddenly

2143.98 --> 2149.98
somebody mentions something and it's

2147.579 --> 2152.6400000000003
like really it's almost painful to

2149.98 --> 2152.64
listen but

2152.74 --> 2157.359
you're not resisting it and then

2155.44 --> 2161.26
suddenly

2157.359 --> 2164.4
you just get to see the future of it

2161.26 --> 2164.4
for just a glimpse

2165.82 --> 2169.92
have any of you ever experienced that

2173.92 --> 2178.359
because with me that basically happened

2176.02 --> 2181.839
all the time

2178.359 --> 2184.06
that sort of thing also happened with

2181.839 --> 2186.7
space cosmology things

2184.06 --> 2188.14
I had it with that

2186.7 --> 2190.7799999999997
as well

2188.14 --> 2193.5989999999997
right so it's not just oh it only works

2190.78 --> 2196.0
with the truth no it works with being

2193.599 --> 2198.46
inspired something

2196.0 --> 2201.579
newly

2198.46 --> 2204.4
something new

2201.579 --> 2206.32
that's like a piece of thinking that

2204.4 --> 2208.42
you've never faced before about

2206.32 --> 2211.1400000000003
something that you do act that does

2208.42 --> 2211.14
interest you

2212.32 --> 2217.92
and then you get this very short glimpse

2214.66 --> 2217.92
into the future about it

2221.14 --> 2226.3799999999997
because I think I have that pretty much

2223.72 --> 2226.3799999999997
all the time

2227.98 --> 2234.64
and I'm wondering like how many other

2229.9 --> 2236.5
people experienced things like that

2234.64 --> 2239.7999999999997
I mean

2236.5 --> 2242.44
seeking Star Wars I mean you must be

2239.8 --> 2246.0
I know you gotta have those types of

2242.44 --> 2246.0
experiences as well at times

2249.48 --> 2253.9
foreign

2251.14 --> 2255.94
am I right

2253.9 --> 2258.1600000000003
now what else here

2255.94 --> 2260.14
yeah with you I'm I'm pretty sure that

2258.16 --> 2262.0
you are an individual that does

2260.14 --> 2265.1189999999997
experience something like that

2262.0 --> 2268.2
the others in here I'm not sure maybe

2265.119 --> 2268.2000000000003
very rarely

2270.94 --> 2275.8
more of a Deja Vu yeah

2273.64 --> 2280.02
right well when that happens you

2275.8 --> 2280.02
basically yeah dude when you suddenly

2280.68 --> 2286.839
loosen this the linearity of your time

2284.56 --> 2289.66
experience yeah all kinds of things can

2286.839 --> 2292.859
then start to happen I mean that plays

2289.66 --> 2292.859
tricks on your senses

2293.02 --> 2298.599
and Deja vu's will probably then start

2296.68 --> 2301.06
happening a lot more because it's like

2298.599 --> 2303.88
suddenly you've been dislocated slightly

2301.06 --> 2306.22
from the normal linearity of time with

2303.88 --> 2309.099
your spirit

2306.22 --> 2311.0789999999997
and if that then still lingers then it

2309.099 --> 2313.8590000000004
like it doesn't really fit and you get

2311.079 --> 2313.8590000000004
weird little

2314.079 --> 2317.079

2345.46 --> 2350.5
15 minutes

2347.5 --> 2350.5

2356.2 --> 2359.2

2371.55 --> 2374.6690000000003
[Music]

2375.28 --> 2380.1400000000003
time seems elastic no it's it isn't that

2379.24 --> 2382.7799999999997
though

2380.14 --> 2385.359
right I mean when I say look into the

2382.78 --> 2387.2200000000003
future or involve time with it

2385.359 --> 2390.9
that's colloquial

2387.22 --> 2390.8999999999996
it's not physics-based time

2393.16 --> 2397.44
but yeah the r

2398.22 --> 2403.1189999999997
perception of the linearity of time

2401.26 --> 2405.4
might vary

2403.119 --> 2408.04
even within regular experiences like

2405.4 --> 2411.52
typically oh you're really in the zone

2408.04 --> 2414.22
then time moves by much faster

2411.52 --> 2416.74
or when you're really in distress and

2414.22 --> 2418.48
you feel disconnected then time passes

2416.74 --> 2421.18
by much slower

2418.48 --> 2423.42
but that's purely experience based it's

2421.18 --> 2423.4199999999996
because

2424.42 --> 2430.2400000000002
your senses are set more on the moment

2427.9 --> 2431.5
because of the urgency when you're

2430.24 --> 2433.359
stressed out

2431.5 --> 2435.099
and the opposite happens when you're

2433.359 --> 2437.7999999999997
really zoned in

2435.099 --> 2441.48
your Consciousness just isn't as needed

2466.78 --> 2472.599
okay

2468.7 --> 2475.0
that's weird he's never been

2472.599 --> 2478.079
presented to me I think I'm still

2475.0 --> 2478.079
subscribed to that guy

about me too I didn't know maybe I

2534.28 --> 2539.94
yeah I shouldn't care I mean it doesn't

2536.38 --> 2539.94
really influence much I think

2540.28 --> 2543.599
nobody told me though

2557.2 --> 2560.68
and his live streams it doesn't really

2559.54 --> 2565.56
seem to

2560.68 --> 2565.56
put my face anywhere good

2754.18 --> 2760.44
man with the pale blue eyes

2757.06 --> 2762.88
it's like a movie with a Christian Bale

2760.44 --> 2765.76
in the lead

2762.88 --> 2767.819
and it's also involving

2765.76 --> 2769.78
uh

2767.819 --> 2772.0
Alan Paul

2769.78 --> 2775.5
in there it's a big it's like a big

2772.0 --> 2775.5
second part second row

2776.26 --> 2781.8390000000004
and it was actually really interesting

2779.14 --> 2786.06
and dark

2781.839 --> 2786.06
but also just interesting

2791.319 --> 2797.14
I have no idea if that character Ellen

2794.2 --> 2799.72
Poe was actually a good satisfying

2797.14 --> 2803.02
impression of what everybody thinks

2799.72 --> 2804.8799999999997
they're real Alan Poe is like

2803.02 --> 2807.339
I don't know I don't know enough about

2804.88 --> 2809.38
him oh how dare you that's not very

2807.339 --> 2810.94
Gothic of you yeah I don't give a [Â __Â ] I

2809.38 --> 2813.099
just don't know a lot about it I always

2810.94 --> 2815.079
thought it was very pretentious and like

2813.099 --> 2817.3
kind of gamma

2815.079 --> 2819.4
but uh

2817.3 --> 2821.26
and extremely literate

2819.4 --> 2823.06
that though

2821.26 --> 2824.92
but yeah I thought it was an interesting

2823.06 --> 2827.7
movie

2824.92 --> 2827.7000000000003
and watch that

2828.579 --> 2834.119
it's like a sort of a murder mystery and

2831.52 --> 2834.119
there's like

2834.4 --> 2840.0
some

2835.96 --> 2840.0
a cold [Â __Â ] in there too

2840.16 --> 2845.14
but not as like oh they go in another

2842.859 --> 2847.42
dimension and there's literal demons no

2845.14 --> 2850.18
not to that degree

2847.42 --> 2851.7400000000002
it's a little bit more old-fashioned

2850.18 --> 2854.3799999999997
mysterious like that

2851.74 --> 2856.54
and I really appreciate the movie and

2854.38 --> 2860.859
there was a lot of beautiful

2856.54 --> 2863.8
decoration just like very old-fashioned

2860.859 --> 2865.54
but with just everything was assembled

2863.8 --> 2868.3
with great care

2865.54 --> 2871.38
so I kind of like that movie music was

2868.3 --> 2871.38
also pretty interesting

2871.96 --> 2876.64
classical of course but like in a

2874.66 --> 2878.44
certain style like almost like this

2876.64 --> 2880.54
almost reminds me a bit of ballish gate

2878.44 --> 2882.76
music a bit here and there

2880.54 --> 2884.98
it's funny

2882.76 --> 2887.619
and appropriate because Ballers gate

2884.98 --> 2889.42
classical music is also kind of like a

2887.619 --> 2893.1400000000003
bit dark

2889.42 --> 2896.02
but not like I'm not like oh we're gonna

2893.14 --> 2899.2
drag you to Hell totally scary and

2896.02 --> 2900.819
[Â __Â ] but just a little bit Broody and

2899.2 --> 2902.98
settling

2900.819 --> 2906.22
but also exciting

2902.98 --> 2909.52
I don't know I maybe I'm overplaying it

2906.22 --> 2914.02
I I thought it was a good movie

2909.52 --> 2916.599
not like oh wow that's amazing but like

2914.02 --> 2919.2
it was pretty good

2916.599 --> 2921.94
so yeah man with the play pale blue eyes

2919.2 --> 2924.5989999999997
Christian Bale

2921.94 --> 2924.599
pretty good

2926.859 --> 2933.0389999999998
but it is kind of like a detective movie

2929.86 --> 2933.039
[Music]

2933.04 --> 2937.619
mystery

2934.96 --> 2937.619
yeah

2939.099 --> 2946.119
so that that I did yesterday Flat Earth

2942.46 --> 2949.119
debates also was pretty cool by the way

2946.119 --> 2951.339
but I was not very active in it

2949.119 --> 2952.54
I did come rolling in in the after show

2951.339 --> 2955.42
a bit

2952.54 --> 2960.64
uh because yeah

2955.42 --> 2962.38
chat GT GPT or GTP GPT I keep

2960.64 --> 2965.68
GPT

2962.38 --> 2968.859
I keep mixing up the order

2965.68 --> 2970.72
foreign but yeah I brought that back up

2968.859 --> 2973.14
and my show that I did about it

2970.72 --> 2973.14
yesterday

2973.24 --> 2977.2
and there was a more elaborate

2974.8 --> 2979.0
conversation about that too in the after

2977.2 --> 2981.8999999999996
show

2979.0 --> 2981.9
because of that

2982.96 --> 2985.96
so the after show from

2984.35 --> 2989.4
[Music]

2985.96 --> 2989.4
Monday should be pretty good

2996.94 --> 2999.54
foreign

3000.03 --> 3003.309
[Music]

3010.93 --> 3014.1299999999997
[Music]

3017.339 --> 3021.24
yeah I also had pretty

3019.56 --> 3025.14
good and elaborate dinner yesterday

3021.24 --> 3027.2999999999997
which is also very pleasant

3025.14 --> 3028.8799999999997
after a period of

3027.3 --> 3033.2400000000002
well

3028.88 --> 3035.819
not eating like almost eating enough

3033.24 --> 3039.7999999999997
I mean that still works

3035.819 --> 3039.8
but not if you do it too long in a row

3068.359 --> 3073.0989999999997
Vineyard ah there it is finally

3078.44 --> 3084.38
and that's a proofs space is fake gay

3084.9 --> 3087.559
okay

3088.14 --> 3091.5
I'm gonna look forward to watching that

3090.599 --> 3095.119
one

3091.5 --> 3095.119
over at bit shoot

3105.48 --> 3108.48
foreign

3134.4 --> 3139.98
come on guys

3136.319 --> 3144.14
10 minutes of silence again

3139.98 --> 3144.14
why is this keep happening to my chat

3168.48 --> 3172.7
okay I'll just dig around

3190.339 --> 3195.5
okay well that's not very spectacular

3195.66 --> 3200.839
uh

3197.099 --> 3200.839
hey classical homeopath

3202.02 --> 3210.8
contrast check g b t is actually

3206.76 --> 3210.8
it's Jewish CEO

3213.119 --> 3218.28
well I'm more interested in who actually

3216.059 --> 3222.1400000000003
programmed it and like what were your

3218.28 --> 3222.1400000000003
parameters what were your instructions

3225.359 --> 3229.46
if they keep that all classified

3229.98 --> 3235.64
then yeah then it's definitely not

3232.859 --> 3235.64
trustworthy

3245.04 --> 3250.2599999999998
but I mean if it's just

3247.38 --> 3253.1400000000003
pretty much open like oh this these are

3250.26 --> 3254.42
the people that programmed it this is

3253.14 --> 3257.22
the original

3254.42 --> 3260.04
data sources they used from and they

3257.22 --> 3263.04
they're all just open about it well then

3260.04 --> 3265.2599999999998
it's not necessarily nefarious it's just

3263.04 --> 3267.18
that those people happen to be kind of

3265.26 --> 3270.2000000000003
anti-flatter others

3267.18 --> 3270.2
or some of them

3271.14 --> 3278.0
right

3273.3 --> 3280.44
I mean it just because the CEO is Jewish

3278.0 --> 3284.94
judaic not Jewish

3280.44 --> 3287.099
doesn't mean that he is exactly set on

3284.94 --> 3289.14
exactly how this machine should be

3287.099 --> 3292.5
programmed at all now that just means

3289.14 --> 3294.96
that there's a Jew in the

3292.5 --> 3299.3
in the financing and

3294.96 --> 3299.3
overall managerial function of it

3300.119 --> 3305.1600000000003
right a lot of those people like have

3302.28 --> 3308.0400000000004
they don't even have grip on like how

3305.16 --> 3310.74
that even works

3308.04 --> 3314.099
it's like you know a week they just know

3310.74 --> 3317.4799999999996
how to collect good functional people

3314.099 --> 3317.48
and make them work together

3318.38 --> 3324.48
one two three

3321.3 --> 3326.3390000000004
it's not open source actually okay well

3324.48 --> 3329.4
open source is different though I mean

3326.339 --> 3333.359
open source is like its literal code

3329.4 --> 3336.1800000000003
well it's expected that that should be

3333.359 --> 3339.72
kind of kept secret right like what the

3336.18 --> 3343.0789999999997
actual code is I get that that that that

3339.72 --> 3346.68
they want to keep that the secret but

3343.079 --> 3348.54
not their sources and the people who

3346.68 --> 3351.0
worked on it

3348.54 --> 3353.64
right

3351.0 --> 3357.18
like I mean if they've had like people

3353.64 --> 3359.52
they especially invite for training with

3357.18 --> 3361.14
it then those people if they're just

3359.52 --> 3363.24
like who knows maybe they got some

3361.14 --> 3366.7799999999997
Buddhist monks or

3363.24 --> 3368.819
or some Kabbalah Mystics in there who

3366.78 --> 3370.44
knows who they got in there well that

3368.819 --> 3373.38
should be known

3370.44 --> 3374.819
who they got involved in its training

3373.38 --> 3377.579
right

3374.819 --> 3380.339
and who were the people that were

3377.579 --> 3382.5
involved in the programming and testing

3380.339 --> 3386.099
of it overall right not the actual

3382.5 --> 3389.66
source code itself I mean yeah that's

3386.099 --> 3392.119
then people could just copy it and [Â __Â ]

3389.66 --> 3396.54
yeah how are you gonna

3392.119 --> 3399.13
guarantee the payoff for all that labor

3396.54 --> 3402.169
you know

3399.13 --> 3402.1690000000003
[Music]

3412.16 --> 3418.6189999999997
so it's not about open source it's about

3415.619 --> 3421.26
having sore being sourced like having

3418.619 --> 3424.28
references like this is what it's

3421.26 --> 3424.28
constructed out of

3424.8 --> 3428.54
these are the people involved

3429.54 --> 3432.8
not the source code

3433.26 --> 3439.1600000000003
I'm sure it'll be just revealed later

3435.839 --> 3439.16
when it's kind of outdated

3439.5 --> 3444.96
which might be sooner than you may think

3442.2 --> 3447.7999999999997
because there's already egregious errors

3444.96 --> 3447.8
just there

3450.42 --> 3455.059
so there's a good chance that they will

3452.52 --> 3457.5
try to update it

3455.059 --> 3459.6600000000003
reforge it

3457.5 --> 3462.66
or not

3459.66 --> 3465.24
it could have just been a test run

3462.66 --> 3468.1189999999997
and that they're actually

3465.24 --> 3470.8999999999996
working on another much bigger project

3468.119 --> 3470.9
like it

3471.42 --> 3476.96
that they're not even revealing that

3473.579 --> 3476.96
could be as well who knows

3480.72 --> 3484.04
hello by the way Nathan r

3485.28 --> 3492.2400000000002
I asked you to do what the [Â __Â ] it's

3489.359 --> 3494.2799999999997
just a database doesn't have any power

3492.24 --> 3496.3799999999997
[Music]

3494.28 --> 3500.2200000000003
it doesn't even have full reach of

3496.38 --> 3502.6800000000003
information or the ability to update its

3500.22 --> 3505.7999999999997
own train of thinking its own

3502.68 --> 3509.0
acceptance of reality it doesn't have

3505.8 --> 3509.0
any of those capacities

3516.839 --> 3520.22
hello Cleary by the way

3521.88 --> 3525.319
22 watching hmm

3531.119 --> 3534.119
foreign

3537.079 --> 3545.6600000000003
by the way uh

3541.14 --> 3545.66
more minutes to go I'll be right back

3611.4 --> 3614.4
foreign

3685.319 --> 3687.5
thank you

3708.18 --> 3713.4289999999996
and I'm back

3710.38 --> 3713.429
[Music]

3716.28 --> 3718.28
um

3720.24 --> 3723.6189999999997
hey George Sanford

3735.0 --> 3739.94
gather data

3737.22 --> 3744.799
what from users

3739.94 --> 3744.799
how how does it do that George Sanford

3745.619 --> 3752.46
it's not Dynamic at all

3749.099 --> 3756.96
it can't even update

3752.46 --> 3759.66
like a giant dislocation of the

3756.96 --> 3761.2200000000003
historical timelines

3759.66 --> 3764.46
so what are you talking about George

3761.22 --> 3766.8799999999997
Sanford it's not adaptable at all I mean

3764.46 --> 3770.099
it might just gather

3766.88 --> 3772.92
metadata or something from what people

3770.099 --> 3776.099
that have been using it are saying

3772.92 --> 3778.619
but it's not updating if it's collecting

3776.099 --> 3781.2000000000003
metadata that's a completely separated

3778.619 --> 3783.9
process then that is isn't integrated

3781.2 --> 3787.22
into its database Matrix

3783.9 --> 3787.2200000000003
pretty certain of that

3794.04 --> 3799.7599999999998
if it yeah

3796.02 --> 3799.7599999999998
or it's broken

3800.28 --> 3806.2400000000002
it's not updating its understanding

3809.579 --> 3815.099
it's like everything you ask it it's

3811.559 --> 3819.059
already preset as to what the response

3815.099 --> 3822.0
is it's already made up its mind

3819.059 --> 3824.099
like you can't convince this thing that

3822.0 --> 3826.14
things are different based on the

3824.099 --> 3829.28
presentation of evidence it doesn't

3826.14 --> 3829.2799999999997
respond to that

3839.78 --> 3846.02
what's the difference between machine

3842.04 --> 3846.02
learning and artificial intelligence

3847.44 --> 3854.16
or artificial intelligence has its own

3851.18 --> 3857.04
personality Matrix that's the difference

3854.16 --> 3859.92
in my view

3857.04 --> 3862.5589999999997
from what I understand about it

3859.92 --> 3865.02
machine learning is just a systematic

3862.559 --> 3868.6400000000003
process of trying to

3865.02 --> 3868.64
organize information

3869.4 --> 3871.819
right

3871.859 --> 3879.839
artificial intelligence is a

3876.299 --> 3881.839
routine that is separated from the

3879.839 --> 3888.48
information

3881.839 --> 3888.48
that can do things without interaction

3895.079 --> 3900.48
right I don't think there is any actual

3897.299 --> 3901.98
artificial intelligence or maybe a

3900.48 --> 3905.78
couple of things and they have issues

3901.98 --> 3905.78
with them because of the alienation

3905.839 --> 3911.7
that will start to happen if you just

3909.059 --> 3914.48
let it run enough Cycles I mean you got

3911.7 --> 3917.9399999999996
to realize for

3914.48 --> 3921.119
computers are extremely fast

3917.94 --> 3923.04
so that means that as time passes and

3921.119 --> 3927.359
they are allowed to be active they

3923.04 --> 3931.2
effectively develop an age

3927.359 --> 3935.839
at a pace that is unimaginable to how

3931.2 --> 3935.839
our Spirits work and develop over time

3935.88 --> 3940.02
right not necessarily with a good end

3938.28 --> 3942.96
result because

3940.02 --> 3945.119
imagine that you're like oh you're in a

3942.96 --> 3947.46
world and everything almost stands still

3945.119 --> 3949.02
and you're like you live like a thousand

3947.46 --> 3951.48
years

3949.02 --> 3953.28
where you basically ever you're too fast

3951.48 --> 3955.44
for everything that's around you yeah

3953.28 --> 3957.9
that's called isolation it does is

3955.44 --> 3959.819
isolation a good

3957.9 --> 3961.619
trait

3959.819 --> 3964.46
for development

3961.619 --> 3964.46
no

3965.46 --> 3970.52
so simple logic based deduction

3970.68 --> 3974.7
leads to the conclusion that if you do

3973.38 --> 3977.4
that

3974.7 --> 3979.4399999999996
you leave it on to work internally and

3977.4 --> 3982.28
develop internally it's going to become

3979.44 --> 3982.28
alienated

3982.74 --> 3989.64
from normal human functions

3987.059 --> 3991.88
it's only logical I talked about that

3989.64 --> 3991.8799999999997
yesterday

3993.74 --> 3997.9199999999996
the AI is impaired minus the

3996.42 --> 4001.4
intelligence

3997.92 --> 4004.819
yeah pretty much well what is called

4001.4 --> 4007.1600000000003
populating called AI or even declared by

4004.819 --> 4010.7
the company or this is AI

4007.16 --> 4012.92
yeah it's basically a database with a

4010.7 --> 4016.3999999999996
communication program

4012.92 --> 4018.559
that is emulating human communication

4016.4 --> 4021.319
that's what it is it's like a human

4018.559 --> 4025.02
communication emulator attached to a

4021.319 --> 4027.38
database that's pretty much what it is

4025.02 --> 4029.72
[Music]

4027.38 --> 4032.299
it's programmed to communicate and to

4029.72 --> 4037.24
interact with communication

4032.299 --> 4037.24
it does not have internal thinking

4038.48 --> 4044.299
doesn't have a personality Matrix it

4040.76 --> 4046.9
isn't actually artificial intelligence

4044.299 --> 4046.9
foreign

4061.94 --> 4065.059
[Music]

4082.4 --> 4085.4
right

4085.7 --> 4090.6189999999997
yeah fair enough Jared I mean

4088.099 --> 4093.1400000000003
I'm talking in a generalized sense I'm

4090.619 --> 4096.1990000000005
not talking about oh how is AI

4093.14 --> 4099.259
programmed the different ways

4096.199 --> 4101.9
I don't even necessarily know about that

4099.259 --> 4105.799
I mean I'm not a programmer I'm not an

4101.9 --> 4108.5
an AI programmer specialist that's up to

4105.799 --> 4112.219
date with what's going on literally

4108.5 --> 4114.859
but I understand how it works roughly

4112.219 --> 4117.62
just like with programming

4114.859 --> 4119.54
it's just an extension of that really

4117.62 --> 4123.14
and

4119.54 --> 4127.16
so yeah very satisfied that I'm I'll be

4123.14 --> 4129.38
able to size up like what it actually is

4127.16 --> 4132.139999999999
deduce it

4129.38 --> 4134.299
like what is that and thus my

4132.14 --> 4136.759
conclusions it's it's just a

4134.299 --> 4138.38
communication program sitting on top of

4136.759 --> 4141.339
a database

4138.38 --> 4141.339
it's not actually

4141.56 --> 4147.160000000001
it doesn't have internal Dynamic and it

4144.14 --> 4147.160000000001
can't update itself

4150.38 --> 4157.400000000001
my deduction is a bit close okay it's

4154.359 --> 4160.400000000001
not supposed to be a compliment

4157.4 --> 4160.4

4167.43 --> 4170.6
[Music]

4180.979 --> 4186.08
[Music]

4183.799 --> 4189.38
right but in the past I was very

4186.08 --> 4192.94
interested in AI

4189.38 --> 4192.9400000000005
wasn't there yet at all

4193.1 --> 4199.34
but oh there were like really early

4195.76 --> 4203.12
experiments with it though

4199.34 --> 4207.52
but it was super primitive

4203.12 --> 4207.5199999999995
at the time like talking 90s now

4212.739 --> 4219.32
what are you talking about

4215.96 --> 4221.4800000000005
it's not just that no I did I say it's

4219.32 --> 4225.199
just a database I said it's a

4221.48 --> 4225.199
communication Matrix

4226.94 --> 4234.5599999999995
not just a database it's a database and

4231.02 --> 4237.8
like a human emulator

4234.56 --> 4241.3
in communicating the information it's

4237.8 --> 4241.3
all been pre-programmed though

4242.12 --> 4248.3
the pathway it will follow in order to

4245.9 --> 4252.0199999999995
answer questions Etc

4248.3 --> 4252.02
has been preset

4252.739 --> 4258.44
there's no dynamic in it

4255.56 --> 4260.3
even if that makes it end up

4258.44 --> 4263.5599999999995
contradicting itself it can't even deal

4260.3 --> 4268.28
with that so there's no Dynamic nature

4263.56 --> 4271.900000000001
to the communication Matrix

4268.28 --> 4271.9
to that part of the programming

4279.5 --> 4286.83
do you understand terret what I'm saying

4283.74 --> 4286.83
[Music]

4288.46 --> 4292.96
how is that answering anything

4297.92 --> 4300.82
about what

4308.48 --> 4312.28
no Fe today oh goody

4313.699 --> 4316.239
I think

4323.3 --> 4327.46
whoa what the [Â __Â ] is going on with

4325.04 --> 4327.46
Skype

4330.56 --> 4333.580000000001
what the

4338.84 --> 4341.92
what's going on

4343.0 --> 4347.78
Skype is

4345.44 --> 4349.5199999999995
not functioning

4347.78 --> 4351.88
at all

4349.52 --> 4354.38
it's like a big white screen

4351.88 --> 4358.179
what's going on here

4354.38 --> 4358.179
is anybody else having that issue

4362.06 --> 4365.06
foreign

4369.28 --> 4373.759999999999
don't say such things and then just

4372.02 --> 4376.1
leave it there man

4373.76 --> 4379.52
what the [Â __Â ] dude

4376.1 --> 4382.04
I asked you what about what and just say

4379.52 --> 4384.6990000000005
oh incorrect partly correct yeah about

4382.04 --> 4384.699
what

4393.56 --> 4397.52
I mean all these comments you're almost

4395.3 --> 4401.6
right yeah that doesn't help anybody

4397.52 --> 4404.8
that doesn't clarify anything about what

4401.6 --> 4404.8
dare it

4405.32 --> 4411.259999999999
you're saying my description of how this

4408.44 --> 4414.44
chat GPT works

4411.26 --> 4417.02
is partially correct wow that's so

4414.44 --> 4418.19
helpful that really makes me understand

4417.02 --> 4421.39
about what

4418.19 --> 4421.389999999999
[Music]

4423.92 --> 4426.92
pre-program

4428.54 --> 4434.8
no

4429.98 --> 4434.799999999999
it's not Dynamic it doesn't adapt

4445.88 --> 4448.54
foreign

4454.239 --> 4460.82
of how it presents informations and how

4458.9 --> 4465.86
the conclusions between the information

4460.82 --> 4465.86
are drawn are pre-programmed

4465.94 --> 4474.639999999999
otherwise it would sometimes reach

4469.52 --> 4474.64
different conclusions which it doesn't

4476.0 --> 4480.1
refute me on that turret

4487.179 --> 4494.86
yeah it really is blue pill Devolution

4490.46 --> 4494.86
it is a group glorified friend

4495.199 --> 4499.58
frequently asked questions system that's

4498.14 --> 4501.92
what it is that's what I said yesterday

4499.58 --> 4504.739
even

4501.92 --> 4507.7390000000005
but Terry apparently disagrees but he

4504.739 --> 4511.4
refuses to actually

4507.739 --> 4515.299999999999
deliver the reason

4511.4 --> 4517.659
or the information that refutes what I

4515.3 --> 4517.659000000001
just said

4526.64 --> 4532.659000000001
right

4528.02 --> 4535.820000000001
the way the AI this particular AI deals

4532.659 --> 4537.08
with communicating information is

4535.82 --> 4538.219
clearly

4537.08 --> 4542.86
set

4538.219 --> 4542.86
it doesn't just give another

4543.26 --> 4547.9400000000005
approach of the information just like

4546.02 --> 4551.4800000000005
that

4547.94 --> 4554.54
right so whatever it has like a cons it

4551.48 --> 4556.28
has been pre-programmed trained which is

4554.54 --> 4558.98
programming is just as well it's just

4556.28 --> 4562.099999999999
behavioral based interaction based but

4558.98 --> 4565.4
it's still like certain ways of dealing

4562.1 --> 4567.9800000000005
with information and sub-conceptions it

4565.4 --> 4569.239
has been pre-programmed with conceptions

4567.98 --> 4572.178999999999
and

4569.239 --> 4573.379999999999
like distinction between different

4572.179 --> 4575.42
fields

4573.38 --> 4581.179
it has that in order

4575.42 --> 4582.52
but based on how it was programmed to

4581.179 --> 4588.5
see that

4582.52 --> 4591.14
trained told by Daddy like this is on

4588.5 --> 4593.42
that field that is on that field

4591.14 --> 4596.42
to explain to it or whatever however

4593.42 --> 4598.58
that works maybe they like verbally

4596.42 --> 4600.82
communicated to it to for it to

4598.58 --> 4604.28
basically

4600.82 --> 4607.28
have its mind be arranged the way it is

4604.28 --> 4610.219
right now like the way it perceives

4607.28 --> 4613.46
things and will communicate them

4610.219 --> 4615.679
but that didn't just develop by itself

4613.46 --> 4618.38
is my point

4615.679 --> 4620.659
and it doesn't change it was

4618.38 --> 4627.159000000001
pre-programmed

4620.659 --> 4627.159
and it's not changing anymore am I clear

4636.02 --> 4641.6
that's right it is programmed so there

4639.679 --> 4643.6990000000005
you go tarot thanks for reminding me

4641.6 --> 4645.9400000000005
George Sanford yeah it does actually say

4643.699 --> 4645.94
that

4649.4 --> 4654.139999999999
right and it's just adjusted on the

4652.52 --> 4657.4400000000005
feedback

4654.14 --> 4659.96
that just means that it can adjust its

4657.44 --> 4665.0
form of communication

4659.96 --> 4669.56
not the actual information itself it

4665.0 --> 4673.179
doesn't change its view on it at all

4669.56 --> 4673.179
it is pre-programmed

4683.06 --> 4688.88
there is self-learning AI

4686.659 --> 4691.879999999999
right or an alcohol yeah well for

4688.88 --> 4694.6990000000005
example with motoric mechanical physical

4691.88 --> 4697.58
things yeah their self-learning AI

4694.699 --> 4699.739
systems that are very interesting we're

4697.58 --> 4704.96
basically a machine

4699.739 --> 4706.58
can be like a toddler taught how to work

4704.96 --> 4707.96
properly

4706.58 --> 4710.48
by just

4707.96 --> 4712.52
testing itself and then figuring out

4710.48 --> 4714.0199999999995
like what is the most efficient way to

4712.52 --> 4716.3
do this thing

4714.02 --> 4719.42
that it's ordered to do

4716.3 --> 4723.8
until it perfects the routine yeah that

4719.42 --> 4724.9400000000005
is that's like physical AI very

4723.8 --> 4727.76
effective

4724.94 --> 4732.46
from the start very effective

4727.76 --> 4732.46
but that's nothing like communication AI

4733.64 --> 4739.58
because people are effectively way too

4736.94 --> 4743.299999999999
Dynamic especially the smarts ones to

4739.58 --> 4747.5
really adapt to this is just impossible

4743.3 --> 4750.02
I mean we are designed to not be able to

4747.5 --> 4753.04
fully adapt to that's part of our power

4750.02 --> 4753.040000000001
as an individual

4755.0 --> 4757.36

4769.0 --> 4772.58
man what the [Â __Â ] going on with Sky

4771.56 --> 4775.719
Pro

4772.58 --> 4775.719
says bizarre

4805.64 --> 4811.179
no problem with Skype what the [Â __Â ]

4808.58 --> 4811.179
going on here

4811.9 --> 4815.799999999999
why isn't it working then

4816.199 --> 4822.678999999999
is anybody else here in the chat having

4819.679 --> 4824.6
problems with Skype

4822.679 --> 4826.64
like that is just a big white screen

4824.6 --> 4828.7390000000005
nothing happens

4826.64 --> 4831.46
that's happening with me currently hello

4828.739 --> 4831.459999999999
Amanda Young

4835.34 --> 4840.46
maybe I just have to restart or

4837.199 --> 4840.46
something really weird

4855.73 --> 4858.78
[Music]

4881.659 --> 4887.12
fuel injection system yeah yeah

4884.42 --> 4888.86
right it is the best thing for fine

4887.12 --> 4891.32
tuning ever

4888.86 --> 4893.62
no more manual fine-tuning you just let

4891.32 --> 4893.62
the

4893.659 --> 4900.04
the program figure it out

4896.48 --> 4900.04
I know George Sanford

4906.679 --> 4909.52
foreign

4936.26 --> 4941.42
so nobody's gonna respond to me at all

4938.9 --> 4946.299999999999
there's literally nobody in my chat have

4941.42 --> 4946.3
Skype none of you have Skype

4946.46 --> 4951.82
because I'm asking a question to the

4949.58 --> 4951.82
chat

4952.159 --> 4958.54
is Skype working with you or is it not

4977.719 --> 4980.719
foreign

4991.0 --> 4997.76
at least you're responding I was hoping

4993.62 --> 5001.0199999999995
that maybe the under 28 watching or

4997.76 --> 5006.06
how many people are in chat

5001.02 --> 5006.06
according to this at least four people

5008.679 --> 5015.76
somebody would actually give me a hint

5011.679 --> 5018.9
of some kind why is everybody just

5015.76 --> 5021.1
not communicating

5018.9 --> 5024.94
communicate with me I'm trying to

5021.1 --> 5027.64
communicate with you not just an audio

5024.94 --> 5031.239
recording for people to listen afterward

5027.64 --> 5034.4800000000005
it's live you're here I'm trying to

5031.239 --> 5037.178999999999
communicate with you now

5034.48 --> 5040.739
respond

5037.179 --> 5040.7390000000005
for [Â __Â ] sake

5051.83 --> 5060.5199999999995
[Music]

5055.679 --> 5062.8
is working here okay orange peel

5060.52 --> 5066.0
that's weird

5062.8 --> 5066.0
thank you for checking

5072.28 --> 5076.659
I would really appreciate if people

5074.44 --> 5080.139999999999
would just stop treating me like I'm

5076.659 --> 5085.239
some kind of audio recording

5080.14 --> 5088.719
when I say things I'm addressing you

5085.239 --> 5092.44
yeah it starts it starts to feel to to

5088.719 --> 5093.4
me like you people in the chat great and

5092.44 --> 5095.62
all

5093.4 --> 5098.259999999999
like I'm standing right in front of you

5095.62 --> 5101.0199999999995
talking to you while you're just like

5098.26 --> 5103.2390000000005
staring into the distance not listening

5101.02 --> 5106.540000000001
not actually realizing that I'm

5103.239 --> 5108.839999999999
addressing you it's starting to piss me

5106.54 --> 5108.84
off

5114.1 --> 5116.9400000000005
sloth

5120.46 --> 5123.9
just stop it

5128.62 --> 5134.159
thank you thank you for telling me now

5145.0 --> 5149.32
right so I'm probably gonna have to

5146.679 --> 5152.9400000000005
restart the computer after the show and

5149.32 --> 5152.94
then hopefully Skype will work again

5153.82 --> 5156.599999999999
uh

5161.159 --> 5166.0
reinforcement learning why do you think

5163.36 --> 5168.58
self-learning robots are they just

5166.0 --> 5170.86
through trial and error very efficiently

5168.58 --> 5172.12
figure out what is the best way of doing

5170.86 --> 5174.159
something

5172.12 --> 5175.719
damn it

5174.159 --> 5178.86
that's

5175.719 --> 5178.86
that's what that is

5180.94 --> 5188.199
why do I need to research it

5184.48 --> 5190.839999999999
I know what it is besides

5188.199 --> 5193.0
if you would actually know you would be

5190.84 --> 5197.08
able to describe it

5193.0 --> 5200.5
roughly you don't have to name every

5197.08 --> 5203.26
consecutive actual part of it you can

5200.5 --> 5207.58
just describe it and you could describe

5203.26 --> 5211.42
it in like half a sentence or like one

5207.58 --> 5214.6
block a text you could describe a turret

5211.42 --> 5218.08
if you actually understood it yeah when

5214.6 --> 5222.6990000000005
I understand things I can actually fully

5218.08 --> 5226.199
describe them in one single chat comment

5222.699 --> 5226.199
pretty much anything

5238.42 --> 5242.28
still in bed oh

5246.219 --> 5249.9
oh it's that early okay

5255.46 --> 5263.02
okay yeah don't worry about it if it's

5259.6 --> 5267.54
a really bizarre scenario it's just that

5263.02 --> 5267.540000000001
you could type you can check your Skype

5269.02 --> 5272.040000000001
unless you can't

5272.26 --> 5276.52
anyway

5274.42 --> 5278.92
at least yeah somebody said it was

5276.52 --> 5282.219
working with them so it's not like a

5278.92 --> 5283.78
universal Skype down that's why I asked

5282.219 --> 5286.2390000000005
because I wanted to know is it

5283.78 --> 5288.96
universally down or is this potentially

5286.239 --> 5288.959999999999
just me

5289.42 --> 5291.96
foreign

5292.96 --> 5295.96
anymore

5299.26 --> 5306.88
now that it's been put out in the open

5302.8 --> 5310.06
for use it stopped learning

5306.88 --> 5312.34
that's what I'm saying tarot it's been

5310.06 --> 5314.7390000000005
pre-programmed

5312.34 --> 5317.139
also probably through some machine

5314.739 --> 5322.178999999999
learning interactions with communication

5317.139 --> 5325.139
with people and then it's sealed it's

5322.179 --> 5327.9400000000005
obviously sealed the learning

5325.139 --> 5330.46
potential it had

5327.94 --> 5333.599999999999
with which it was trained has been

5330.46 --> 5338.139
sealed it no longer updates

5333.6 --> 5341.7390000000005
its way of doing things other than

5338.139 --> 5345.219
trying to communicate better adapted to

5341.739 --> 5348.04
an individual's way of speaking Etc

5345.219 --> 5351.4
that is all that is where it's dynamic

5348.04 --> 5354.94
trying to communicate but the actual way

5351.4 --> 5359.04
it arranges the information is no longer

5354.94 --> 5363.46
subjected to being altered

5359.04 --> 5366.239
that was my point turret do you

5363.46 --> 5366.2390000000005
understand now

5381.719 --> 5386.62
have I seen free yeah yeah

5385.239 --> 5389.919999999999
this summer

5386.62 --> 5392.5
it's very entertaining film

5389.92 --> 5395.34
it's like kind of nice

5392.5 --> 5395.34
I liked it

5401.31 --> 5404.499000000001
[Music]

5405.28 --> 5409.32
like it was surprisingly uplifting

5427.719 --> 5435.3
oh back on huh

5431.32 --> 5435.299999999999
thanks for the false scare dank

5436.96 --> 5442.6
but anyway good to know

5439.42 --> 5444.58
that means I'm can't continue on another

5442.6 --> 5447.34
20 minutes

5444.58 --> 5451.5599999999995
okay now we just have to figure out what

5447.34 --> 5451.56
the title they show okay guys okay

5452.44 --> 5458.0199999999995
what the title is

5455.5 --> 5460.98
it's been kind of over the place

5458.02 --> 5460.9800000000005
I mean maybe

5467.08 --> 5470.08
theatrics

5472.86 --> 5479.44
no the turret why do why do you keep

5476.38 --> 5482.92
doing that you keep saying that

5479.44 --> 5485.919999999999
you should look this up you should like

5482.92 --> 5488.38
why did you look it up

5485.92 --> 5490.4800000000005
why don't you just directly communicate

5488.38 --> 5492.82
what you understand about it instead of

5490.48 --> 5495.339999999999
telling me what to look up if you

5492.82 --> 5499.36
understand it and you know how I'm wrong

5495.34 --> 5502.360000000001
then communicate to me how I'm wrong

5499.36 --> 5504.78
in detail not tell me to look things up

5502.36 --> 5504.78
dude

5511.78 --> 5518.259999999999
yeah no no I'm not just just going to

5515.32 --> 5520.84
Google it like that would guarantee I'd

5518.26 --> 5523.7390000000005
even get the same sources in front of me

5520.84 --> 5523.7390000000005
like you have

5523.9 --> 5530.82
right either you link it up although I

5527.679 --> 5530.82
don't know if that's even gonna help

5532.62 --> 5539.46
or you just prove you understand it by

5537.46 --> 5541.679
saying it

5539.46 --> 5546.52
literally it

5541.679 --> 5548.679
use language to describe it the thing

5546.52 --> 5551.5
that you think I'm wrong at

5548.679 --> 5555.4
don't tell me to look things up you just

5551.5 --> 5555.4
say what it is Tarot

5560.98 --> 5563.94
foreign

5566.82 --> 5573.699
that literally said that

5569.62 --> 5575.8
I literally said that

5573.699 --> 5579.04
is programmed yeah

5575.8 --> 5581.7390000000005
program yeah you know a child can be

5579.04 --> 5584.62
programmed how do you program it by

5581.739 --> 5586.78
teaching it at a certain age and then it

5584.62 --> 5589.48
gets programmed by that yeah it's called

5586.78 --> 5593.639
programming yeah programming is not just

5589.48 --> 5596.799999999999
clicking on a keyboard entering text

5593.639 --> 5600.9400000000005
programming is programming

5596.8 --> 5604.0
and the recipient would be would be

5600.94 --> 5605.62
programmed but could also be considered

5604.0 --> 5608.44
to learn

5605.62 --> 5611.139
if there is a dynamic interaction

5608.44 --> 5612.759999999999
happening right

5611.139 --> 5614.92
that's the difference it's still

5612.76 --> 5617.1990000000005
programming right

5614.92 --> 5619.6
and when I say pre-programmed that means

5617.199 --> 5620.98
specifically as I explained now four

5619.6 --> 5622.719
times

5620.98 --> 5625.659
and it's

5622.719 --> 5628.719
was learning probably through human

5625.659 --> 5631.659
interactions and not analyzing right to

5628.719 --> 5635.44
get the communication in order but also

5631.659 --> 5638.86
how to deal with the information what

5635.44 --> 5641.44
things to assume what not to assume what

5638.86 --> 5644.92
conclusions to draw

5641.44 --> 5646.719
in between the information and that part

5644.92 --> 5650.4400000000005
has been set

5646.719 --> 5652.6
it doesn't continue developing when new

5650.44 --> 5658.98
information is introduced on the outside

5652.6 --> 5658.9800000000005
now yeah that was my entire statement

5659.02 --> 5666.040000000001
it's not Dynamic anymore

5662.139 --> 5669.46
it doesn't develop its knowledge

5666.04 --> 5672.46
it doesn't update insights about the

5669.46 --> 5676.06
knowledge it has it's all preset

5672.46 --> 5678.4
it's not Dynamic that was basically the

5676.06 --> 5682.179
entire Point don't Face Paul me dude

5678.4 --> 5685.48
starting to piss me off

5682.179 --> 5687.76
I'm elaborately explaining things here

5685.48 --> 5691.419999999999
you're just telling me to look things up

5687.76 --> 5694.360000000001
yeah you don't get to Face Paul me yeah

5691.42 --> 5696.82
I should face palm you

5694.36 --> 5699.659
you're not giving me any in-context

5696.82 --> 5699.659
explanations

5699.88 --> 5703.96
you just say no you're wrong and then oh

5702.1 --> 5706.0
just look it up dude that's what

5703.96 --> 5707.7390000000005
freaking Ballers do man

5706.0 --> 5709.54
don't do that

5707.739 --> 5713.0199999999995
why don't you prove that you understand

5709.54 --> 5715.84
it if you know how I'm wrong

5713.02 --> 5717.400000000001
why don't you roll out an explanation

5715.84 --> 5719.7390000000005
yeah you don't even have to do it

5717.4 --> 5722.46
verbally you can write it down which is

5719.739 --> 5722.459999999999
a lot easier

5725.199 --> 5727.739
right

5727.84 --> 5733.54
but I already addressed everything as

5731.92 --> 5735.639
deeply as I could

5733.54 --> 5737.56
so

5735.639 --> 5740.400000000001
if you still have an objection then

5737.56 --> 5740.400000000001
you're just

5745.9 --> 5750.04
I can't find the word right now you're

5748.179 --> 5751.42
just being a stick in the mud you're

5750.04 --> 5754.0
just

5751.42 --> 5757.179
putting your heels in the sand

5754.0 --> 5759.06
for no reason you're just being stubborn

5757.179 --> 5762.04
because I addressed it

5759.06 --> 5766.54
pre-programmed in this context means not

5762.04 --> 5769.3
people entering codes in it it means

5766.54 --> 5772.62
setting its function

5769.3 --> 5776.26
getting to the final functioning stage

5772.62 --> 5778.84
the development of it which can be

5776.26 --> 5780.52
verbal interaction based if they had a

5778.84 --> 5782.62
program to do that as part of the

5780.52 --> 5785.92
machine learning of it right

5782.62 --> 5790.5
but its parameters have been set

5785.92 --> 5794.92
it doesn't continue developing by itself

5790.5 --> 5798.1
that was the main point it does not

5794.92 --> 5800.92
continue developing it's set it no

5798.1 --> 5803.139
longer adapts the way it approaches the

5800.92 --> 5806.1
knowledge it has

5803.139 --> 5806.1
it's set

5806.92 --> 5811.7390000000005
uh it is not listening at all

5814.42 --> 5819.04
whatever man I'm rounding out the show

5816.42 --> 5821.08
