yeah nice and warm the wind is not too

104.91 --> 109.71
warm it's not so as moist as well as it

107.039 --> 113.67
was yesterday there was no storm though

109.71 --> 115.32
no real storm but anyway this morning it

113.67 --> 117.38
cleared up and the wind picked up a

115.32 --> 122.38999999999999
little and it's just really nice weather

117.38 --> 122.39
to do all kinds of things outside

129.36 --> 136.39000000000001
yeah my mustache is looking sharp is it

thanks for that good service I do my

136.39 --> 139.20999999999998
best

136.96 --> 143.05
I don't really know what I'm doing I'm

139.21 --> 144.25
just I don't know sticking to certain

143.05 --> 147.25
patterns because I

144.25 --> 152.17
yeah I've never had a mustache before so

147.25 --> 156.97
it's yeah I've read like my hair's the

152.17 --> 159.94
hairs are like not being very they say

156.97 --> 162.37
straight they're constantly yeah my

159.94 --> 165.37
hairs are you have to have a will of

162.37 --> 168.37
their own sometimes I guess it's because

165.37 --> 170.29
I sleep on my partially on my face

168.37 --> 172.3
sometimes and I guess that your mustache

170.29 --> 174.81
can get kind of twisty that way

172.3 --> 177.61
[Music]

174.81 --> 178.12
but yeah overall I'm kind of happy about

177.61 --> 179.98000000000002
it

178.12 --> 184.24
it's better than I had hoped for

179.98 --> 186.7
originally so although I don't think

184.24 --> 190.87
it's really gonna get any better better

186.7 --> 192.94
I might be able to like get it all

190.87 --> 195.07
Chinese and all that like but that's

192.94 --> 198.75

11:00 so what does that mean exactly

356.88 --> 361.53

359.94 --> 363.18
way Thank You Mandy young for the dollar

363.18 --> 365.57

366.82 --> 369.88
[Music]

380.79 --> 391.79

387.84 --> 397.2
let's get what no what Oh

391.79 --> 400.74
PayPal oh okay I'll - I'll check thank

397.2 --> 404.34
you will menu Wow

400.74 --> 408.54
I was just gonna talk about little about

404.34 --> 411.11999999999995
money cuz yeah I've been trying my phone

408.54 --> 413.73
thing and it's like a giant idiotic

411.12 --> 420.12
disaster I'll explain why Thank You

413.73 --> 424.52000000000004
Mandy young 20 euros ah it's really good

420.12 --> 424.52
I can really use that

427.3 --> 433.319
yeah because I think that there's a lot

431.319 --> 435.66900000000004
of things just suddenly gonna pretty oh

433.319 --> 438.25
well thank you by the way good servant

435.669 --> 440.96999999999997
for the one zero eleven so but you had

438.25 --> 440.97
the nation as well

441.389 --> 449.169
wait I'm getting it chaos but anyway I'm

446.38 --> 451.69
basically just there's things seem to be

449.169 --> 454.18
changing storage wise I might have to

451.69 --> 455.65
somehow pay for that all of a sudden but

454.18 --> 461.199
at the same time there's other things

455.65 --> 464.79999999999995
that are happening like my GTI running

461.199 --> 466.33000000000004
full and I really haven't even looked at

464.8 --> 469.27000000000004
what I can actually do with that because

466.33 --> 471.659
it's such a task to do that it's like a

469.27 --> 475.539
big research task and something that I

471.659 --> 479.38
don't know I don't really like that too

475.539 --> 481.449
much it's it it doesn't really touch

479.38 --> 483.639
upon my interest doing it so it's really

481.449 --> 485.53000000000003
tough for me it's like okay I have to do

483.639 --> 490.93
is to get some kind of money out of it

485.53 --> 493.29999999999995
for real but ah it's annoying it's like

490.93 --> 495.40000000000003
going to a class that you really don't

493.3 --> 497.139
like but you have to get it to get a

495.4 --> 501.07
good grade or you won't make it that

497.139 --> 503.65000000000003
kind of feel ah but anyway I'll get to

501.07 --> 507.969
that over time and at the same time I

503.65 --> 510.13
went to ride my phone now try to get

507.969 --> 512.829
that code okay so I tried to get the

510.13 --> 517.659
code couldn't get it and then my dad

512.829 --> 521.169
said yeah there's been like an accident

517.659 --> 526.45
like he had a hardest crash a while back

521.169 --> 530.11
and he had that code but it was on that

526.45 --> 532.089
hard disk and it's like gone and now

530.11 --> 534.04
both of us really don't even know like

532.089 --> 537.1
how to get started again that good day

534.04 --> 539.56
yeah the last time we had to initialize

537.1 --> 542.1700000000001
all of that that took days so this is

539.56 --> 544.8389999999999
like oh [ __ ] so I just said okay screw

542.17 --> 546.7299999999999
this it's gonna cost me a little but I'm

544.839 --> 553.73
just gonna get a credit card through my

546.73 --> 558.5600000000001
bank it's super bass basic but

553.73 --> 565.76
I think it should work and it's like 20

558.56 --> 568.6389999999999
euros a year I guess I guess it's not as

565.76 --> 570.8
bad as I thought but I'm gonna do that

568.639 --> 576.139
and then finally gonna get that fresh

570.8 --> 581.3599999999999
air thing the Alexa pure and you'll get

576.139 --> 583.55
this situation over with it's like

581.36 --> 586.13
really silly sitting on money and then

583.55 --> 587.51
just not being able to spend it because

586.13 --> 595.37
of complications

587.51 --> 597.139
it's so weird about anyway I'm gonna get

595.37 --> 599.36
that out of the way probably after the

597.139 --> 602.899
weekend somewhere I'll be getting that

599.36 --> 604.88
card and I'll just do it and then kind

602.899 --> 606.649
of as I predicted originally because my

604.88 --> 609.649
money kind of came in earlier than I

606.649 --> 612.199
thought but I did predict originally

609.649 --> 616.76
about it that I would probably get it

612.199 --> 618.709
somewhere halfway or late June and the

616.76 --> 622.31
way things are rolling out now

618.709 --> 624.91
that seems to be right on target unless

622.31 --> 627.7689999999999
the shipping is gonna take a long time I

624.91 --> 629.7199999999999
don't know how long the old if yeah

627.769 --> 633.589
sometimes there's like a month or more

629.72 --> 636.019
delay but maybe that's not gonna happen

633.589 --> 637.73
with like the air filter thing which I'm

636.019 --> 640.519
certain they're gonna ship separate

637.73 --> 644.089
because it's a big thing anyway so

640.519 --> 649.75
that's um yeah or winning business

644.089 --> 649.75
situation things update

653.46 --> 656.149
huh

656.9 --> 666.81
okay Missouri bear the [ __ ] isn't that

663.47 --> 670.1700000000001
Wow how did you arrive to that

666.81 --> 682.9799999999999
conclusion paganism always leads to

670.17 --> 684.39
human sacrifice really I guess it all

682.98 --> 688.19
depends on what you're going to define

684.39 --> 688.1899999999999
as paganism you know

708.709 --> 720.93
Vatican as a Jesuit Pope so there

712.199 --> 723.4799999999999
awesomes are bad all right well look you

720.93 --> 729.66
should see it like this in a way you

723.48 --> 732.2090000000001
know like why would it

729.66 --> 734.91
like let's get super basic here like

732.209 --> 737.0089999999999
let's throw everything all the giant

734.91 --> 739.259
amount of complexities you've learned

737.009 --> 744.0600000000001
out of the we know for a second let's

739.259 --> 747.899
like get mega basic so why is the Pope

744.06 --> 752.2689999999999
being a Jesuit why is that conflicting

747.899 --> 757.5
you know well it's because Jesuits are

752.269 --> 763.259
like The Secret Service or in the agency

757.5 --> 767.61
of the Vatican so it's like in a way

763.259 --> 771.38
it's similar to Obama being president of

767.61 --> 777.75
the United States because Obama I think

771.38 --> 779.88
was CIA or is CIA like that so that

777.75 --> 783.709
makes it extremely controversial because

779.88 --> 787.949
the CIA isn't supposed to do that

783.709 --> 790.2299999999999
see that's not their jurisdiction like

787.949 --> 792.5999999999999
CA specifically has to stay outside of

790.23 --> 796.61
the country and all that but their

792.6 --> 800.8190000000001
operations roughly and with the Vatican

796.61 --> 803.13
well it's kind it mirrors that situation

800.819 --> 806.0999999999999
like having a Jesuit as a pope

803.13 --> 810.5
yeah it's their secrets how can their

806.1 --> 812.5690000000001
secret service be a leader that's that

810.5 --> 817.649
doesn't seem right

812.569 --> 821.459
Bush was CIA right so I think that that

817.649 --> 825.3
is really the prime concern before yeah

821.459 --> 828.199
any cell phone has Syndrome is unleashed

825.3 --> 828.199
upon the whole thing

830.05 --> 834.579
okay you have if you say so

847.25 --> 849.85
Hey

850.63 --> 857.73
right Missouri Barrett yeah Jesuits are

854.139 --> 861.79
not supposed to be poked just like CIA

857.73 --> 866.23
really aren't supposed to be president

861.79 --> 873.519
well they're not supposed to be active

866.23 --> 876.73
and and president like yeah like and I

873.519 --> 881.139
don't think that you can even step down

876.73 --> 883.87
as a Jesuit to fulfill some funk it

881.139 --> 886.6800000000001
doesn't work like that I don't know man

883.87 --> 889.75
I'm a little out of my league with this

886.68 --> 892.7199999999999
I'm just as I said like throw everything

889.75 --> 895.06
away before we approach this in a very

892.72 --> 898.99
basic way it's just like yeah like just

895.06 --> 900.91
like that it's about organizational

898.99 --> 902.319
functions and what they're supposed to

900.91 --> 906.459
do and what they're not supposed to do

902.319 --> 909.389
and that's where the oddity comes in as

906.459 --> 909.3889999999999
far as I'm concerned

914.66 --> 922.75
[Music]

916.91 --> 922.75
Wow neither Jews nor Jesuits huh

930.87 --> 934.049
[Music]

936.42 --> 939.42
right

957.49 --> 960.99
although Rick Priestley

974.52 --> 977.21
hmm

990.23 --> 994.99
oh really Missouri bear like

997.999 --> 1008.0790000000001
were they any good I think that I had

1002.949 --> 1011.7289999999999
probably a few did Jesuit teachers like

1008.079 --> 1011.7289999999999
in school that where I win

1022.37 --> 1028.189
I think that like they were as teachers

1025.73 --> 1032.05
they were pretty good as far as I could

1028.189 --> 1035.8700000000001
tell but they seem to be very private

1032.05 --> 1038.079
like really in the role of teacher like

1035.87 --> 1038.079
that

1043.55 --> 1046.72
oh okay

1054.55 --> 1060.25
okay all right well yeah my school

1057.68 --> 1060.25
wasn't like that

1069.65 --> 1072.719
[Music]

1073.6 --> 1079.6699999999998
really have a yeah well I've been seeing

1076.55 --> 1082.57
some really weird report stories don't

1079.67 --> 1087.77
know yeah it must be true otherwise

1082.57 --> 1092.1789999999999
because of who's bringing it up like I'm

1087.77 --> 1093.47
hearing now that apparently sorry in a

1092.179 --> 1095.6000000000001
way it makes me kind of feel stupid

1093.47 --> 1097.73
every time I even mention something like

1095.6 --> 1100.73
this it just feels like information

1097.73 --> 1103.6100000000001
placement now but apparently now Trump

1100.73 --> 1109.88
administration is considering nuclear

1103.61 --> 1115.28
testing again last time was in 1992

1109.88 --> 1118.42
apparently so yeah that's just

1115.28 --> 1118.42
completely pointless

1144.94 --> 1152.8300000000002
alright by the way I I'm getting like

1148.629 --> 1155.4989999999998
from the alternative news in the

1152.83 --> 1158.049
Netherlands like just a minor source

1155.499 --> 1161.529
that if it's like the only place where

1158.049 --> 1163.889
I'm like hanging on because Dutch media

1161.529 --> 1166.539
Oh God

1163.889 --> 1170.59
apparently there have been like Corona

1166.539 --> 1174.609
based fines and there's already like

1170.59 --> 1176.83
groups of lawyers getting into action to

1174.609 --> 1179.83
basically stop this because it's

1176.83 --> 1187.33
unconstitutional like that's in the

1179.83 --> 1189.009
Netherlands so yeah it's not just all

1187.33 --> 1192.129
happening and nobody's doing anything

1189.009 --> 1194.2
about that's good I haven't had been

1192.129 --> 1197.799
confronted with anything like that you

1194.2 --> 1200.1390000000001
know to me like Corona fines are virtual

1197.799 --> 1201.9089999999999
at this point because I've never seen it

1200.139 --> 1204.7589999999998
actually happen I've seen situations

1201.909 --> 1206.979
where I thought like hmm is that like

1204.759 --> 1210.22
are they harassing him for some kind of

1206.979 --> 1213.909
social distancing nonsense wasn't too

1210.22 --> 1216.69
sure about it but they've never really

1213.909 --> 1216.69
harassed me

1217.71 --> 1224.3790000000001
although yeah in a way I dunno like the

1221.349 --> 1227.47
feeling when police are like cruisin

1224.379 --> 1229.299
around trying to take a target like yeah

1227.47 --> 1233.489
there's a certain feel that comes off it

1229.299 --> 1236.95
you know it's it's like a big fish

1233.489 --> 1239.2
scouting around him to see if there's

1236.95 --> 1242.259
like a prey around it it just has this

1239.2 --> 1246.429
feel so I quickly pick up on that and

1242.259 --> 1252.369
make sure I don't get in their radar as

1246.429 --> 1255.7
it were and me wearing all black can be

1252.369 --> 1262.2389999999998
very helpful at it depending on your

1255.7 --> 1264.5800000000002
stance right anyway but yeah that's I

1262.239 --> 1269.08
guess good to hear that there's

1264.58 --> 1271.72
supposedly action against it in the

1269.08 --> 1284.039
Netherlands because I do think it's all

1271.72 --> 1287.409
just ridiculous alright another article

1284.039 --> 1292.239
Canadian scientist claimed medicinal

1287.409 --> 1297.22
cannabis helps against Kovach 19 like

1292.239 --> 1300.429
yeah if every type of death ever from

1297.22 --> 1303.789
now on is due to covered 19 than any

1300.429 --> 1306.19
kind of remedy for whatever is gonna be

1303.789 --> 1312.33
a remedy against covered 19 by that same

1306.19 --> 1315.3590000000002
logic so yeah if like this weird title

1312.33 --> 1317.9189999999999
manipulation game with the covert 19 is

1315.359 --> 1320.08
like once you start to understand what's

1317.919 --> 1324.0590000000002
really going on it does make a little

1320.08 --> 1327.609
bit more sense it's just like

1324.059 --> 1331.739
superfluous politicization in a way

1327.609 --> 1331.739
medical politicization it's just

1340.29 --> 1344.73
anyway getting distracted

1344.99 --> 1348.059
[Music]

1360.07 --> 1362.85
trunk

1375.58 --> 1378.58
yeah

1381.29 --> 1388.6399999999999
yeah you know what yeah everything you

1384.32 --> 1393.3799999999999
know concerning Trump I really agree in

1388.64 --> 1396.89
many aspects in many ways with how own

1393.38 --> 1399.2900000000002
Benjamin has described it like I think

1396.89 --> 1404.45
he is kind of a good guy but he's like

1399.29 --> 1408.17
just being strategical and he is yeah

1404.45 --> 1413.42
making choices that that just don't

1408.17 --> 1416.0900000000001
agree with like yeah the people that are

1413.42 --> 1418.6100000000001
that really believe in him so he's just

1416.09 --> 1420.1999999999998
yeah sowing bad seeds in between and all

1418.61 --> 1422.1999999999998
that and this is just yeah has its

1420.2 --> 1427.21
consequences but that doesn't mean that

1422.2 --> 1427.21
like he should like become now the enemy

1428.89 --> 1434.0300000000002
it's like I don't know the way to do it

1432.32 --> 1436.9299999999998
and the weird thing is in a way even

1434.03 --> 1440.54
Alex jota's kind of identified this

1436.93 --> 1442.76
weather yeah whatever value that is to

1440.54 --> 1445.0
you it's like yeah you have to just tell

1442.76 --> 1448.73
him when he's just straight out wrong

1445.0 --> 1451.97
like make noise about it send signals

1448.73 --> 1454.7
across the airwaves make it stick that

1451.97 --> 1456.8500000000001
signal and then it'll somehow reach him

1454.7 --> 1459.8300000000002
and he'll catch on like okay this is

1456.85 --> 1463.01
this doesn't work because I think that

1459.83 --> 1464.71
he's probably just so scrambled up from

1463.01 --> 1469.04
all the data he's been fed he just

1464.71 --> 1472.81
doesn't really know what is what anymore

1469.04 --> 1475.9099999999999
and how to interpret things maybe you

1472.81 --> 1479.24
know if you get isolated and like a lot

1475.91 --> 1482.03
of CIA's information stuff is getting

1479.24 --> 1485.48
unleashed and who who knows what else

1482.03 --> 1493.37
yeah they'll drive you nuts you'll be

1485.48 --> 1496.19
lost so we had and sometimes I also

1493.37 --> 1499.4899999999998
think that it's just like no it's just a

1496.19 --> 1502.01
role he's playing when he does that it's

1499.49 --> 1504.68
like the the presidential role has all

1502.01 --> 1507.01
that nonsense in it and he has no say in

1504.68 --> 1513.88
it so it's just like a speaker for that

1507.01 --> 1516.1299999999999
role and maybe maybe it would be better

1513.88 --> 1521.169
if he if this is like possible for him

1516.13 --> 1524.71
to do that to clear up when he is

1521.169 --> 1526.72
actually speaking as the president like

1524.71 --> 1528.309
when he's fulfilling like saying

1526.72 --> 1530.08
something as a president that's

1528.309 --> 1534.22
basically part of what he's supposed to

1530.08 --> 1536.559
be saying and when he is speaking for

1534.22 --> 1538.26
himself in his own opinion and think

1536.559 --> 1541.96
he's already kind of trying that and

1538.26 --> 1544.809
then if he keeps that up persistently

1541.96 --> 1549.88
then yeah you could also read into that

1544.809 --> 1553.0
as to like what is he being forced to do

1549.88 --> 1556.5300000000002
and what is he trying to do with the

1553.0 --> 1556.53
maneuvering room he has left

1564.15 --> 1568.3200000000002
that's that's a good point Missouri bear

1566.55 --> 1570.27
just like doctors don't practice

1568.32 --> 1574.05
medicine anymore neither do presidents

1570.27 --> 1583.5
act of their own volition yeah the debt

1574.05 --> 1586.07
so that's an interesting analogy yeah in

1583.5 --> 1589.26
a way I guess it is the

1586.07 --> 1593.73
compartmentalization effect like an

1589.26 --> 1595.3799999999999
industrialization of that function that

1593.73 --> 1598.5
takes away the individual choice and

1595.38 --> 1601.92
just makes you forces you into becoming

1598.5 --> 1605.01
the actor of a program and I guess it's

1601.92 --> 1607.14
it is in a way similar because that has

1605.01 --> 1607.95
also kind of happened happened in a

1607.14 --> 1610.8000000000002
medical system

1607.95 --> 1617.28
now of course good doctors can resist

1610.8 --> 1620.76
that but a lot just don't they just go

1617.28 --> 1623.09
for the money or yeah fancy pants or

1620.76 --> 1623.09
whatever

1632.17 --> 1636.45
you ain't supposed to be Supreme Leader

1640.71 --> 1647.38
well it depends depending on the

1644.71 --> 1652.6000000000001
situation of course acaba is of course

1647.38 --> 1655.89
the leader of the army virtually but

1652.6 --> 1658.48
there's also just this representation of

1655.89 --> 1661.75
like what is going to happen what is the

1658.48 --> 1663.88
district like the rollout of all the the

1661.75 --> 1666.61
preponderance of all the plans that all

1663.88 --> 1669.669
the government has done and all that the

1666.61 --> 1675.34
deals they've made and yeah so it was

1669.669 --> 1677.74
like a speaker but yeah that that

1675.34 --> 1681.49
doesn't mean that he has to agree with

1677.74 --> 1683.76
that so that's a bit confusing how that

1681.49 --> 1683.76
works

1704.36 --> 1716.549
hmm they never investigate vaccines they

1709.919 --> 1724.2
just administer them yeah I I don't

1716.549 --> 1728.07
really understand what why he would go

1724.2 --> 1734.269
along with that but there may yeah

1728.07 --> 1738.12
there's probably more applications to

1734.269 --> 1740.58
vaccines in general than most people

1738.12 --> 1742.0189999999998
even realize because now yeah we are

1740.58 --> 1742.83
getting more confronted with the

1742.019 --> 1746.07
eugenics

1742.83 --> 1750.1789999999999
eugenics aspect of it and even the idea

1746.07 --> 1752.1589999999999
of getting become being traced through

1750.179 --> 1756.3890000000001
ships and all that and that's all being

1752.159 --> 1760.94
suggested has been for a while right so

1756.389 --> 1764.9089999999999
maybe there are bigger plans upon that

1760.94 --> 1767.3700000000001
that are like too alluring to throw that

1764.909 --> 1772.2890000000002
away or something for the bigger

1767.37 --> 1774.7399999999998
planners and it may not necessarily even

1772.289 --> 1779.279
be as nefarious as we're all expecting

1774.74 --> 1781.559
but in their minds so that doesn't mean

1779.279 --> 1784.26
that when if it would actually roll out

1781.559 --> 1786.36
it would not become nefarious because

1784.26 --> 1788.25
it's very likely it will especially if

1786.36 --> 1791.37
you just look at like what is this world

1788.25 --> 1793.409
I'll do grab less work everything Kansas

1791.37 --> 1796.26
seemed fine until they grabbed less

1793.409 --> 1799.97
strike and then they just fill in all

1796.26 --> 1801.71
the dark spots and twist everything to

1799.97 --> 1805.25
their will

1801.71 --> 1805.25
whatever was set up

1808.5 --> 1816.33
so yeah maybe that is the reason why

1813.3 --> 1821.61
he's just like no we gotta let the

1816.33 --> 1824.07
vaccine program go and or just maybe

1821.61 --> 1826.35
he's even divided about it like okay

1824.07 --> 1828.03
there are novax's I get it like who you

1826.35 --> 1830.09
can get autism from it but at the other

1828.03 --> 1835.04
end yeah but there are people that

1830.09 --> 1838.05
really persist on that and they're like

1835.04 --> 1842.6299999999999
believers and mave so maybe he's like

1838.05 --> 1851.37
divided and he's just doing this to see

1842.63 --> 1856.5900000000001
what to do with it maybe it is like a

1851.37 --> 1859.83
decision in progress about the vaccines

1856.59 --> 1865.3799999999999
for him because he doesn't really know

1859.83 --> 1868.11
what to think about it you know if from

1865.38 --> 1871.0800000000002
a neutral standpoint and you're not very

1868.11 --> 1873.7199999999998
medically informed personally if you're

1871.08 --> 1877.6799999999998
gonna try to look into vaccines and then

1873.72 --> 1880.8600000000001
go into the conspiracy direction from a

1877.68 --> 1882.63
normy standpoint into anti-vaxxers and

1880.86 --> 1884.6999999999998
then realize like oh god you could get

1882.63 --> 1889.74
this that no look at all these examples

1884.7 --> 1894.9
and yeah then that's like oh that's not

1889.74 --> 1897.81
good but then you go into the shells and

1894.9 --> 1901.0400000000002
those are often it's like more informed

1897.81 --> 1904.62
medical medical medically studied people

1901.04 --> 1907.4099999999999
that like managed to put out very

1904.62 --> 1910.56
elaborate stories to basically the relay

1907.41 --> 1912.65
the cause of all those things in some

1910.56 --> 1917.55
way and basically divert everything

1912.65 --> 1921.45
there like medical ballers in a way like

1917.55 --> 1925.47
ballers can cleverly twist things also

1921.45 --> 1927.48
can these chills pro-vaccine twist very

1925.47 --> 1930.6000000000001
cleverly more effectively than the

1927.48 --> 1933.72
ballers can do their things even you

1930.6 --> 1936.03
know make it makes it more nefarious so

1933.72 --> 1941.8700000000001
maybe Trump just did that right into it

1936.03 --> 1941.87
and it's just like I don't know you know

1945.83 --> 1951.06
if he would be from that perspective

1948.69 --> 1955.2
then I could understand why he's doing

1951.06 --> 1958.05
it like this to just see like yeah I

1955.2 --> 1959.79
don't know some people are for it they

1958.05 --> 1961.32
have a good story and some people are

1959.79 --> 1965.31
against it and they have their good

1961.32 --> 1969.21
reasons and I don't know let's see what

1965.31 --> 1972.54
happens maybe that is why all of this

1969.21 --> 1974.73
the the his response is happening and

1972.54 --> 1976.59
why he's also like at the same time they

1974.73 --> 1979.17
like yeah yeah FX he is of course and

1976.59 --> 1983.6399999999999
but also yeah try try your own remedies

1979.17 --> 1987.3500000000001
at the same time and just I don't know

1983.64 --> 1987.3500000000001
does that make any sense what I'm saying

1989.45 --> 1995.67
could he be the just uncertain and

1992.88 --> 1997.97
divided about vaccines just not sure

1995.67 --> 1997.97
anymore

2004.039 --> 2009.619
because yet and this is kind of a

2006.619 --> 2013.97
general issue with the medical system in

2009.619 --> 2016.549
general that is if you kind of like

2013.97 --> 2020.299
claim a direct cost like vaccines cause

2016.549 --> 2023.299
this well do they always or is that is

2020.299 --> 2025.22
it even preventable if you're like in a

2023.299 --> 2028.19
very good condition and you're very

2025.22 --> 2030.169
aware of it and like the doses is not

2028.19 --> 2033.529
too high and this is what a lot of

2030.169 --> 2035.96
medical chills pro-vaccine also talk I

2033.529 --> 2039.83
used to be kind of on that side a bit

2035.96 --> 2041.299
I was like yeah vaccines it's like going

2039.83 --> 2044.539
out of control it's be used but

2041.299 --> 2047.509
technically it should be kind of

2044.539 --> 2049.819
possible you know I was like very modest

2047.509 --> 2054.26
at it but yeah I've learned more about

2049.819 --> 2057.71
it like even what's way back and things

2054.26 --> 2060.73
that have been kind of going under the

2057.71 --> 2066.46
radar through the vaccine program and

2060.73 --> 2066.46
yeah I can't take that stance anymore

2067.149 --> 2074.6189999999997
right inject poisons you get sick that's

2071.359 --> 2080.0
true but what if you're like really

2074.619 --> 2083.69
prepared for it well you will want your

2080.0 --> 2087.919
organs just be like okay we're optimal

2083.69 --> 2090.71
condition let's get to work with this

2087.919 --> 2092.3289999999997
[ __ ] as quickly as possible maybe some

2090.71 --> 2094.399
yeah that because I've heard of that

2092.329 --> 2096.079
before like if you want if you need to

2094.399 --> 2099.02
get a vaccine I've heard even this type

2096.079 --> 2104.03
of advice from people from the health

2099.02 --> 2106.869
Ranger way before like okay if you take

2104.03 --> 2109.4
a vaccine and you have like these

2106.869 --> 2111.65
specific type of herbs you take before

2109.4 --> 2113.119
that or into certain yeah I don't even

2111.65 --> 2114.859
remember what it was but if you do

2113.119 --> 2117.44
certain things and you have like I guess

2114.859 --> 2120.339
a lot of your vitamin C and you while

2117.44 --> 2124.099
you take a vaccine and the vaccine

2120.339 --> 2126.89
amount versus the body weight is not too

2124.099 --> 2129.02
much then the body can handle it and

2126.89 --> 2133.16
your organs can take it and there won't

2129.02 --> 2135.529
be any permanent damage like it would be

2133.16 --> 2137.45
much much rarer percentile wise or some

2135.529 --> 2139.64
that that's kind of the story

2137.45 --> 2142.64
that it got to here and it's like yeah

2139.64 --> 2144.3489999999997
but that does really sound sensible so

2142.64 --> 2147.7999999999997
when you look at from that perspective

2144.349 --> 2151.27
it's always a combination like any time

2147.8 --> 2153.53
any kind of supposed meditation or

2151.27 --> 2155.81
vaccine or something is supposedly

2153.53 --> 2157.88
direct cause of a damage it's usually a

2155.81 --> 2162.23
combination of things it's usually the

2157.88 --> 2164.869
body's condition and like the admit the

2162.23 --> 2166.76
administering is not correct because of

2164.869 --> 2169.52
the body weight ratio or whatever you

2166.76 --> 2173.329
know that kind of thing like if the

2169.52 --> 2177.64
doctor is not really careful then it can

2173.329 --> 2181.13
be dangerous there being just reckless

2177.64 --> 2183.95
systemized reckless don't really look at

2181.13 --> 2186.02
the the patient specifically realizing

2183.95 --> 2189.71
like how much damage you could do if

2186.02 --> 2191.54
you're not very careful yeah man I'm mo

2189.71 --> 2193.2400000000002
a scientist owning like a probe vaccine

2191.54 --> 2195.92
Sheila is weird

2193.24 --> 2200.66
in general I'd say just never do it

2195.92 --> 2204.2000000000003
right I'm just saying that because of

2200.66 --> 2206.839
this I would understand that some people

2204.2 --> 2209.18
would just not really be able to make up

2206.839 --> 2211.7599999999998
their minds about like is it really the

2209.18 --> 2215.0789999999997
cause but what about the diets of those

2211.76 --> 2215.079
people you know

2222.85 --> 2229.69
but yeah mercury in vaccines evidence

2226.66 --> 2233.68
please yeah it's called thimerosal still

2229.69 --> 2238.51
in a t12 it's known it submitted by

2233.68 --> 2242.16
merrill south it's a it's a certain type

2238.51 --> 2247.51
of mercury and it's it it's part of the

2242.16 --> 2250.75
flu vaccines I'm certain of it it's not

2247.51 --> 2254.5
an every vaccine I think but it yeah it

2250.75 --> 2256.98
is part of flu vaccines as far as I

2254.5 --> 2256.98
remember

2262.08 --> 2265.08
anyways

2268.92 --> 2278.16
uh no acaba no there was never malaria

2273.51 --> 2287.07
and Amsterdam not due to any natural

2278.16 --> 2289.95
spread anyway I don't know maybe

2287.07 --> 2292.59
somebody did like release a batch of

2289.95 --> 2294.39
malaria mosquitos at one point and then

2292.59 --> 2296.84
like a lot of people got malaria but

2294.39 --> 2301.19
that's not they're not gonna survive

2296.84 --> 2301.19
it's not the right climate for them

2305.09 --> 2308.09
thankfully

2312.97 --> 2317.4399999999996
what kind of fever was it that ravaged

2315.4 --> 2319.4500000000003
the Netherland in this summer back in

2317.44 --> 2324.34
the good old what are you talking about

2319.45 --> 2326.6189999999997
man there's no such thing the

2324.34 --> 2330.4
Netherlands hasn't had real mosquito

2326.619 --> 2332.59
problem since its founding because the

2330.4 --> 2335.05
Netherlands used to be basically a lot

2332.59 --> 2338.65
of swamps and rivers and then we started

2335.05 --> 2343.9
pouring and dredging so yeah no more

2338.65 --> 2346.51
swamps barely any and yeah with less

2343.9 --> 2351.9700000000003
swamps it becomes less mosquitoes and

2346.51 --> 2352.9900000000002
all that so although there's still some

2351.97 --> 2359.77
lakes here and there

2352.99 --> 2361.45
those have mosquitoes but no but we've

2359.77 --> 2364.109
never had any kind of malaria outbreak

2361.45 --> 2364.109
or anything

2383.58 --> 2391.7799999999997
why would you even why are you asking

2386.83 --> 2394.17
any like gangs I don't know what would I

2391.78 --> 2394.17
care

2399.94 --> 2405.58
like the only thing I've ever seen in

2403.33 --> 2410.0699999999997
this city that kind of reminds me of

2405.58 --> 2413.17
sort of like gang like activity is when

2410.07 --> 2415.69
what is it like some Turkish envoy in

2413.17 --> 2419.4700000000003
the big car just starts to race around

2415.69 --> 2426.13
like anti-social speeds just in this

2419.47 --> 2428.98
through the through the city like they

2426.13 --> 2433.3900000000003
they race through the city this is very

2428.98 --> 2435.07
dangerous sometimes it's crazy that's

2433.39 --> 2437.64
like the worst I've ever seen other than

2435.07 --> 2441.19
that I don't know man

2437.64 --> 2444.8199999999997
there might be like groups everywhere

2441.19 --> 2446.62
doing stuff but it's not like I don't

2444.82 --> 2450.13
know I don't think there's any gang

2446.62 --> 2453.91
activity I don't know man maybe like

2450.13 --> 2456.6600000000003
like underground world but I never get

2453.91 --> 2456.66
to see any dad

2476.7 --> 2479.54
mmm

2481.16 --> 2488.96
okay random explore well there you can

2485.45 --> 2493.2799999999997
what is it citronella it's like the

2488.96 --> 2495.29
certain herb there's also like all kinds

2493.28 --> 2496.82
of yeah you can just put that on there

2495.29 --> 2499.54
and mosquitoes you really don't like it

2496.82 --> 2506.9
you will smell like a lemon though but

2499.54 --> 2509.96
it does really work and maybe there's

2506.9 --> 2513.2200000000003
even better stuff for that now that's

2509.96 --> 2513.2200000000003
what I remember exist

2537.6 --> 2543.75
my hobby I forgot three virus deaths

2541.43 --> 2547.969
yeah

2543.75 --> 2547.969
[Music]

2565.81 --> 2572.31
yeah high stallion 8012 I'm doing fine

2574.8 --> 2579.28
I'm just looking in chat what you guys

2577.18 --> 2582.0
are talking about seeing if I can pick

2579.28 --> 2582.0
up on something

2587.11 --> 2590.1890000000003
[Music]

2607.06 --> 2615.58
oh right yeah there may be a little

2609.79 --> 2618.7799999999997
little piece of interesting info but

2615.58 --> 2622.12
what might happen with the show because

2618.78 --> 2624.94
yeah I talked with Betty she was she's

2622.12 --> 2627.45
like the server owner for for Nathan

2624.94 --> 2631.54
Oakley and ball busters and all that

2627.45 --> 2634.96
well I kind of got offered to get like

2631.54 --> 2640.14
my own little room there so I might be

2634.96 --> 2642.58
able to utilize that for the show

2640.14 --> 2645.31
originally the idea was make my own

2642.58 --> 2650.3199999999997
complete surfer but maybe just a room

2645.31 --> 2651.61
there would work great and then it would

2650.32 --> 2654.76
be a matter of just learning how to

2651.61 --> 2657.94
control that room and moderate it make

2654.76 --> 2661.3
sure it's not gonna be a mess and then I

2657.94 --> 2664.89
could use it as a as a panel to get ya

2661.3 --> 2664.8900000000003
to tap into for the show

2669.06 --> 2678.84
because ya over Skype you know I'm it's

2672.67 --> 2678.84
it's nice having contact over Skype but

2679.5 --> 2683.74
yeah well people may have noticed that I

2681.88 --> 2688.69
don't have a lot of people on the show

2683.74 --> 2693.52
over Skype because I don't I don't know

2688.69 --> 2695.23
why that is but it just I just don't

2693.52 --> 2698.98
seem to get a lot of guests but maybe

2695.23 --> 2701.56
it's also because I just need to be a

2698.98 --> 2704.8
little bit more planning than just

2701.56 --> 2708.49
saying okay will you come on the show

2704.8 --> 2710.5
right then and like have an agenda like

2708.49 --> 2712.3599999999997
that but I'm not much of an agenda

2710.5 --> 2720.76
person when it comes to this type of

2712.36 --> 2724.54
thing don't literally don't have one but

2720.76 --> 2728.23
anyway yeah discord little discord panel

2724.54 --> 2730.77
option might be coming in the near

2728.23 --> 2732.79
future that would be interesting I

2730.77 --> 2736.24
definitely would like to have good

2732.79 --> 2738.91
serving on there well yeah you know what

2736.24 --> 2739.41
well most of you if you have some kind

2738.91 --> 2743.339
of disc

2739.41 --> 2747.5099999999998
access most of you would be welcome in

2743.339 --> 2749.49
there and then I don't know since you

2747.51 --> 2752.369
seem to be more and more and more active

2749.49 --> 2754.3489999999997
in chat even maybe we could try like

2752.369 --> 2757.23
having a next step and just instead of

2754.349 --> 2759.78
you haven't having you in chat just

2757.23 --> 2762.66
having you talk about these things and

2759.78 --> 2765.75
then make that part of the show instead

2762.66 --> 2769.2
of me just looking in the chat then

2765.75 --> 2773.21
sometimes responding because there's all

2769.2 --> 2773.21
kinds of conversations going on here I

2777.619 --> 2783.75
think that could be interesting

2780.119 --> 2786.21
I could even do it like this that's at

2783.75 --> 2789.569
some point when all if you do have

2786.21 --> 2791.73
access that would just be conversations

2789.569 --> 2793.859
going and then when I spot a

2791.73 --> 2795.78
conversation think hmm this is

2793.859 --> 2798.99
interesting I could just say hey would

2795.78 --> 2801.15
you two like to come on the discord

2798.99 --> 2804.66
server and talk about it on my show

2801.15 --> 2811.38
instead of chatting it see there's

2804.66 --> 2813.5389999999998
another an interesting idea that way

2811.38 --> 2817.2000000000003
yeah you could have more than just our

2813.539 --> 2820.579
window talking although some people

2817.2 --> 2820.5789999999997
really seem to like that

2838.15 --> 2844.5
hello page is that the real page I think

2842.29 --> 2844.5
it is

2851.46 --> 2854.53
[Music]

2869.52 --> 2878.609
stressed a bit like a the real you

2873.82 --> 2878.6090000000004
what's stressing you out Paige

2904.88 --> 2915.7400000000002
you cabin no no no no don't don't do

2911.25 --> 2920.07
that now you see malaria is not a virus

2915.74 --> 2922.83
you know there's a good argument from a

2920.07 --> 2926.4
very baseline medical bottoms up

2922.83 --> 2930.869
perspective to argue that viruses don't

2926.4 --> 2935.07
exist bacteria like flesh-eating

2930.869 --> 2937.23
bacteria though are yeah they are

2935.07 --> 2939.69
provable although not all bacteria are

2937.23 --> 2941.16
like that so yeah it's not as

2939.69 --> 2942.4500000000003
generalized as that as well but I think

2941.16 --> 2946.14
that that's been medically

2942.45 --> 2949.08
well-established but viruses could

2946.14 --> 2951.5099999999998
definitely be considered to be all fake

2949.08 --> 2956.54
as a concept in the first instance like

2951.51 --> 2960.3900000000003
it's not that but malaria is not a virus

2956.54 --> 2968.099
malaria is a parasite that parasite is

2960.39 --> 2970.74
very very real absolutely real like yeah

2968.099 --> 2973.9500000000003
you can have a malaria parasite under

2970.74 --> 2980.089
the under a microscope it's not even

2973.95 --> 2980.089
like that microscopic malaria is real

2984.6 --> 2987.659
[Music]

2995.82 --> 3001.13
no no it's not stupid at all

2999.0 --> 3003.02
maybe we should look into the

3001.13 --> 3008.51
alternative I think it's called now

3003.02 --> 3013.7599999999998
field theory was it opposing virus

3008.51 --> 3019.07
theory that they are actually an

3013.76 --> 3022.46
integral part of the cellular meta meta

3019.07 --> 3025.28
baal ism systems a clean up considering

3022.46 --> 3027.8
you could consider them as a clean up

3025.28 --> 3030.59
response crew I've even established this

3027.8 --> 3032.63
very early on and there's no more

3030.59 --> 3042.17
elaborate videos describing this and

3032.63 --> 3044.06
it's it is backed up by research okay

3042.17 --> 3047.06
well stallion eighty twelfth and

3044.06 --> 3054.43
Missouri bears mistaken no Missouri bear

3047.06 --> 3054.43
can sometimes exaggerate a little but

3057.13 --> 3062.08
alright yeah

3059.0 --> 3064.16
well if you're misinformed about malaria

3062.08 --> 3066.2
thinking that it's supposed to be a

3064.16 --> 3068.0
virus and then say yeah but viruses are

3066.2 --> 3070.8999999999996
fake so malaria must be fake it's

3068.0 --> 3075.7
mistaken because malaria is not a virus

3070.9 --> 3075.7000000000003
it's a parasite so

3081.22 --> 3088.0299999999997
no no conspiracy Katz is not gonna get

3084.47 --> 3088.0299999999997
banned you're gonna get banned

3096.51 --> 3103.8500000000004
we use viruses every day in genetic

3099.75 --> 3109.08
engineering how do you do that exactly

3103.85 --> 3112.65
so you use these viruses in the genetic

3109.08 --> 3118.64
engineering process you say so how does

3112.65 --> 3126.33
that make viruses an infectious agent

3118.64 --> 3128.6099999999997
conspiracy can you tell me because I'm

3126.33 --> 3133.47
pretty sure that viruses don't have

3128.61 --> 3136.04
genetic code cuz they're too small they

3133.47 --> 3141.14
have I think a couple of RNA fragments

3136.04 --> 3144.45
at best so they're not living entities

3141.14 --> 3148.79
they're like a mechanism of microbial

3144.45 --> 3152.0099999999998
and mechanism not alive

3148.79 --> 3158.16
they can't procreate on their own not

3152.01 --> 3161.5800000000004
without other mechanisms to provide for

3158.16 --> 3164.54
it like cells cells that can then be

3161.58 --> 3168.69
transformed into reproducing more of it

3164.54 --> 3172.55
because it's a tool it's not an

3168.69 --> 3172.55
infectious organism

3178.849 --> 3185.46
they are used as factors to deliver the

3182.609 --> 3188.88
genes right so you're using the tools

3185.46 --> 3190.289
you're using viruses as tools well yeah

3188.88 --> 3195.9
that makes sense because that's what

3190.289 --> 3198.8900000000003
they are so how does you using these and

3195.9 --> 3202.2000000000003
calling them viruses these specific

3198.89 --> 3203.67
identified as virus agents and there I

3202.2 --> 3208.23
think they should have another name

3203.67 --> 3211.7000000000003
right what if you use if you use them to

3208.23 --> 3215.19
do something how does that support

3211.7 --> 3218.3689999999997
viruses being infectious agents that

3215.19 --> 3221.2490000000003
spread and how does that work how does

3218.369 --> 3225.44
that prove that could you could you

3221.249 --> 3225.4399999999996
clarify that conspiracy cats

3252.12 --> 3255.0499999999997
right

3257.46 --> 3262.68
you can only use them because they

3259.74 --> 3264.6299999999997
infect the host cell right because of

3262.68 --> 3267.54
the mechanism where they can enter a

3264.63 --> 3272.28
cell under the right conditions and do

3267.54 --> 3275.089
stuff with it transform it right so I'm

3272.28 --> 3278.3100000000004
not denying that it has that mechanism

3275.089 --> 3283.91
how does that make it an infectious

3278.31 --> 3286.65
agent that can kind of like spread and

3283.91 --> 3291.8689999999997
infect people and then spread again how

3286.65 --> 3293.88
does that support that because I'm

3291.869 --> 3297.089
pretty sure that yeah

3293.88 --> 3300.119
viruses being able to enter a cell and

3297.089 --> 3307.32
transform it only happens in certain

3300.119 --> 3309.599
conditions if the cell is like yeah

3307.32 --> 3314.54
vulnerable enough you could call it or

3309.599 --> 3314.54
basically open to be transformed

3319.97 --> 3331.22
yeah yeah I know that so that that

3327.74 --> 3334.1499999999996
doesn't really address the issue here

3331.22 --> 3334.1499999999996
conspiracy caps

3338.88 --> 3346.59
yeah it's a replication mechanism it's

3341.91 --> 3350.69
like as a building mechanism that it can

3346.59 --> 3350.69
do under circumstances

3363.84 --> 3372.3
yeah I know that's right

3379.96 --> 3382.65
yeah

3393.15 --> 3398.839
right so yeah you have you have all that

3395.849 --> 3401.88
the supposed germs are spread the

3398.839 --> 3403.68
viruses are multiplying and it's having

3401.88 --> 3406.799
this side effect you're going in this

3403.68 --> 3408.96
metabolic overhaul with all the goo and

3406.799 --> 3411.63
all these side products right and there

3408.96 --> 3414.18
is viruses in all that so if you sneeze

3411.63 --> 3417.7690000000002
on somebody they get like these viruses

3414.18 --> 3422.7
on them and then what happens you know

3417.769 --> 3424.47
they yeah they may just get it in their

3422.7 --> 3427.069
mouth or in their nose or who knows in

3424.47 --> 3432.1499999999996
their eye right and then what happens

3427.069 --> 3435.509
well it's just gonna sit there get

3432.15 --> 3437.7490000000003
absorbed and then if the person is in

3435.509 --> 3441.029
good condition

3437.749 --> 3445.1699999999996
viruses are going to be like okay we are

3441.029 --> 3448.17
here to clean up so is there any need

3445.17 --> 3450.7200000000003
for clean up and then the body's gonna

3448.17 --> 3453.9300000000003
say no no we're all good here

3450.72 --> 3459.779
we're all good and then nothing's gonna

3453.93 --> 3462.8689999999997
happen and that's how at times I've been

3459.779 --> 3465.48
here in this house surrounded by people

3462.869 --> 3468.1800000000003
that were all coughing and sneezing and

3465.48 --> 3473.369
looking terrible all over the place

3468.18 --> 3475.5589999999997
touching everything right and I just be

3473.369 --> 3479.789
there and I wouldn't get it

3475.559 --> 3484.1090000000004
I just wouldn't get it just like that

3479.789 --> 3487.5490000000004
could be for like weeks because it

3484.109 --> 3487.549
doesn't work like that

3487.999 --> 3494.279
you only get sick when the body is

3491.009 --> 3498.15
actually ready for it when it's like

3494.279 --> 3501.809
yeah we need to clean up here we got

3498.15 --> 3505.2490000000003
cells available for you to to replicate

3501.809 --> 3509.13
let's get this done that's how it works

3505.249 --> 3512.1899999999996
it's not a viral agent penetrating you

3509.13 --> 3515.3900000000003
and then the hostile takeover no that's

3512.19 --> 3515.39
not how that works at all

3518.2 --> 3521.29
[Music]

3534.58 --> 3538.4
[Music]

3571.78 --> 3579.3700000000003
yeah the hug page yeah conspiracy

3575.32 --> 3581.02
captures correct it's not dead because

3579.37 --> 3584.7
in order to be dead it would have to be

3581.02 --> 3584.7
alive its nonliving

3586.08 --> 3589.409
[Music]

3590.97 --> 3596.74
that's why I would prefer to that's why

3594.16 --> 3601.23
I personally prefer to regard as them as

3596.74 --> 3601.2299999999996
mechanisms or tools

3625.46 --> 3628.73
all right

3640.21 --> 3650.44
yeah conspiracy cats that still doesn't

3643.15 --> 3652.9900000000002
make it alive I think you don't really

3650.44 --> 3657.279
understand what the concept of a life

3652.99 --> 3661.99
really is that means self-sustaining

3657.279 --> 3670.27
organism something that can like

3661.99 --> 3673.1189999999997
procreate on its own right so if they're

3670.27 --> 3678.279
not alive how can they invade if there

3673.119 --> 3682.869
is not a life function then how can they

3678.279 --> 3691.119
invade it they can't it doesn't work

3682.869 --> 3695.7400000000002
like that there is no need in order to

3691.119 --> 3698.7000000000003
drive the non organism the nonliving

3695.74 --> 3704.14
thing to spread there is no need for it

3698.7 --> 3705.8489999999997
it's just a mechanism well you could

3704.14 --> 3709.5099999999998
even say there is a need for it to

3705.849 --> 3712.779
spread and that is like the tool that it

3709.51 --> 3714.789
is and it can be spread through people

3712.779 --> 3716.799
when they're all in poor condition and

3714.789 --> 3719.8900000000003
then it'll like everybody will get that

3716.799 --> 3722.859
that mechanism in them to clean up the

3719.89 --> 3724.6299999999997
damage because that's what they're

3722.859 --> 3727.299
really there to do like if they wouldn't

3724.63 --> 3730.779
spread that doesn't mean that the people

3727.299 --> 3733.049
would do better than if it would if it

3730.779 --> 3733.049
would

3774.88 --> 3782.9500000000003
right yeah conspiracy cats we get the

3777.28 --> 3786.9700000000003
point they are organic that's right but

3782.95 --> 3789.6899999999996
they're not living things you already

3786.97 --> 3794.56
conceded that so what's the point here

3789.69 --> 3799.41
what's why yeah why are you still

3794.56 --> 3804.36
presuming that viruses are dangerous

3799.41 --> 3810.24
organisms that invade and spread around

3804.36 --> 3810.2400000000002
for their own benefit kind of situation

3831.95 --> 3838.7599999999998
I just think that this the hostility of

3835.48 --> 3842.89
a virus being an infectious agent I

3838.76 --> 3846.349
think this is just a conjured spirit

3842.89 --> 3848.99
like this mechanism is just being

3846.349 --> 3852.349
ascribed as being animated being this

3848.99 --> 3855.3799999999997
wheel driven thing that doesn't goes to

3852.349 --> 3857.81
people and then just takes them over and

3855.38 --> 3860.2400000000002
but I think that that is conjured I

3857.81 --> 3862.57
don't think it works anything like that

3860.24 --> 3862.5699999999997
at all

3874.7 --> 3877.85
[Music]

3888.02 --> 3890.86
all right

3893.509 --> 3902.529
I don't know if he's arrogant if he's

3896.779 --> 3905.149
got a degree in biology as he says well

3902.529 --> 3906.889
that's okay it doesn't really mean

3905.149 --> 3909.729
anything in a direct sense you know

3906.889 --> 3914.119
because a degree in biology is nothing

3909.729 --> 3917.029
compared to what you really need to do

3914.119 --> 3919.2490000000003
to be a biologist which is gonna take

3917.029 --> 3922.219
basically spending the rest of your life

3919.249 --> 3925.279
figuring out what the how absurdly

3922.219 --> 3930.7290000000003
complex it all is right because what you

3925.279 --> 3930.729
just learn as a degree is just this much

3931.59 --> 3934.679
[Music]

3934.809 --> 3944.989
so yeah you might want to reconsider

3940.699 --> 3947.659
your idea of viruses it's not something

3944.989 --> 3949.849
you should be afraid of you should be

3947.659 --> 3953.659
much more afraid of just the condition

3949.849 --> 3956.989
your body's in and if your diet is right

3953.659 --> 3961.849
if you're not chewing yourself up over

3956.989 --> 3964.849
stress situations because that's all

3961.849 --> 3969.199
gonna impact you a lot more than if this

3964.849 --> 3972.8590000000004
virtual virus is gonna hit you somehow

3969.199 --> 3975.759
you know like what's the worst that

3972.859 --> 3978.529
could happen you could have like a cold

3975.759 --> 3981.7690000000002
maybe even a bad cold if you're like

3978.529 --> 3985.99
very stressed out before that and then

3981.769 --> 3990.2099999999996
what nothing

3985.99 --> 3990.2099999999996
you're just gonna go back to normal

4027.94 --> 4036.94
what is the source okay well for example

4033.25 --> 4039.79
look into dr. hammer and Rudolf Steiner

4036.94 --> 4041.92
and yeah when you start looking around

4039.79 --> 4045.04
with real signer you'll start to pick up

4041.92 --> 4046.9900000000002
on more alternative medical people

4045.04 --> 4049.5099999999998
because there's been a lot of them that

4046.99 --> 4052.2999999999997
have kind of on their own volition did

4049.51 --> 4054.82
their own studies usually they even had

4052.3 --> 4058.0600000000004
to fund it themselves because yeah

4054.82 --> 4061.03
Rockefeller Foundation founded medical

4058.06 --> 4062.7999999999997
system did not want that so they had to

4061.03 --> 4066.3
do it all themselves and that has been

4062.8 --> 4066.3
happening for over a hundred years

4075.39 --> 4079.62
yeah that's the support that's a claim

4077.7 --> 4083.04
you can't support there's definitely

4079.62 --> 4089.16
doctors that have said that viruses

4083.04 --> 4092.97
don't work like infectious entities that

4089.16 --> 4095.1299999999997
invade people very elaborate

4092.97 --> 4102.69
presentations on the Internet going

4095.13 --> 4106.79
viral pun intended right and those were

4102.69 --> 4111.509999999999
doctors on record very good doctors good

4106.79 --> 4115.2
reputations and they can afford to say

4111.51 --> 4118.7300000000005
that cuz they're right and they're

4115.2 --> 4122.49
clever in how they're putting it down

4118.73 --> 4126.12
cuz yeah the system that doesn't want

4122.49 --> 4127.889999999999
that research open is going to look over

4126.12 --> 4131.37
their shoulder if they're not making

4127.89 --> 4136.320000000001
some kind of technical mistake and then

4131.37 --> 4138.42
to try to yeah get their licenses

4136.32 --> 4141.96
retract for saying something is not

4138.42 --> 4146.39
superfluous doctor according to yeah the

4141.96 --> 4149.46
system so there's plenty of doctors that

4146.39 --> 4154.38
yeah have addressed this situation

4149.46 --> 4157.74
without breaking any rules even so

4154.38 --> 4160.35
you're incorrect conspiracy cats you're

4157.74 --> 4164.82
just saying that no doctor has done that

4160.35 --> 4167.990000000001
but that's because you have not been

4164.82 --> 4167.99
properly informed

4189.68 --> 4196.17
now conspiracy cats does not claims that

4193.62 --> 4201.59
have no foundation backed up by for

4196.17 --> 4204.54
example dr. hammers extensive research

4201.59 --> 4210.39
people based research animal based

4204.54 --> 4214.08
research double-blind situations yeah

4210.39 --> 4217.1900000000005
research very elaborate decades worth of

4214.08 --> 4217.19
research yeah

4226.56 --> 4232.950000000001
just just look into dr. hammer and the

4229.53 --> 4235.86
German new medicine as it's been named

4232.95 --> 4238.23
now used to be something different but

4235.86 --> 4239.49
they call it just a new medicine they

4238.23 --> 4240.929999999999
have trouble with that so they call the

4239.49 --> 4242.429999999999
German new medicine it's pretty long

4240.93 --> 4244.8
it's been out there for a while

4242.43 --> 4247.29
yeah they got dragged dr. hammer got

4244.8 --> 4250.41
dragged to court over it by the medical

4247.29 --> 4252.9
system right big time they were

4250.41 --> 4255.99
insisting this is false information it's

4252.9 --> 4259.23
a lie is incorrect well they put

4255.99 --> 4262.91
everything they had on to that full

4259.23 --> 4269.25
lawyers lots of money lots of publicity

4262.91 --> 4271.86
even but like pre-recording that kind of

4269.25 --> 4275.78
situation and then after the long

4271.86 --> 4280.67
long-winded courts situation was over

4275.78 --> 4285.54
dr. hammer won because the the opponent

4280.67 --> 4287.43
they could not find anything in the way

4285.54 --> 4290.55
he researched thing all his work all

4287.43 --> 4293.46
this registry of the experiments medical

4290.55 --> 4296.97
experiments legal ones that if undergone

4293.46 --> 4299.4
that he's done they couldn't prove him

4296.97 --> 4300.81
to be incorrect they couldn't prove that

4299.4 --> 4304.0199999999995
he did anything wrong they couldn't

4300.81 --> 4307.88
prove that he was falsifying anything

4304.02 --> 4313.2300000000005
not a thing so they had to drop it after

4307.88 --> 4317.52
wasting like millions on that and then

4313.23 --> 4322.86
the media just nobody heard anything

4317.52 --> 4325.02
about it nobody just that's why nobody's

4322.86 --> 4328.469999999999
heard of dr. hammer because that

4325.02 --> 4330.72
happened with dr. hammer because in his

4328.47 --> 4333.740000000001
study with German new medicine approach

4330.72 --> 4336.84
he basically proved that viruses don't

4333.74 --> 4342.24
exist or literally just you don't have

4336.84 --> 4346.43
to even pay attention to that it's just

4342.24 --> 4349.83
one of the things that's real that's

4346.43 --> 4355.34
experiment backed up experiments backed

4349.83 --> 4355.34
up medical tests lots of it

4355.85 --> 4360.96
got dragged to cart and one okay this

4359.85 --> 4364.1990000000005
this is nuts

4360.96 --> 4366.84
who will bring you bring your proof or

4364.199 --> 4370.169999999999
we no no no I am very certain dr. hammer

4366.84 --> 4374.85
got dragged to courts big time and one

4370.17 --> 4376.2300000000005
and then was never yet nobody just

4374.85 --> 4378.75
dropped in the background

4376.23 --> 4383.339999999999
it's huge humiliation for the system

4378.75 --> 4388.219
huge so yeah that's where nobody knows

4383.34 --> 4388.219
of him look into it

4408.199 --> 4418.19
oh right now now back to fer we yeah

4414.86 --> 4421.61
yeah that's right conspiracy cats your

4418.19 --> 4426.799999999999
atheism is fake your outer space is fake

4421.61 --> 4431.989
your microbiology is fake there's no

4426.8 --> 4434.81
place you've dug where we cannot point

4431.989 --> 4439.669999999999
that something that's not fake because

4434.81 --> 4443.05
it is that's what this world is I know

4439.67 --> 4446.719
you felt it before and you had doubts

4443.05 --> 4450.56
and it hurts because it should hurt it

4446.719 --> 4453.02
hurts me but I'm getting over it and

4450.56 --> 4456.070000000001
getting to deal with it you should too

4453.02 --> 4456.070000000001
it's much better that way

4477.11 --> 4484.849999999999
Wow he doesn't even know like he's being

4483.11 --> 4487.13
such a globe or about this he's

4484.85 --> 4489.8
literally I've just mentioned dr. hammer

4487.13 --> 4491.869
and all that I bet he's never heard of

4489.8 --> 4494.119000000001
it he's not looked it up right now

4491.869 --> 4496.219
or he has and just confuses him so he

4494.119 --> 4502.03
clicked it away again and now he doesn't

4496.219 --> 4506.86
even know who kaufman is it's brilliant

4502.03 --> 4509.86
you're not much of a biologist if I if I

4506.86 --> 4509.86
may

4514.81 --> 4518.749000000001
[Music]

4535.489 --> 4547.73
yeah by the way which one is that andrew

4539.21 --> 4550.16
kaufman right because i realize yeah

4547.73 --> 4552.5599999999995
there's a lot of kaufman so i've heard

4550.16 --> 4555.5
of that name before but yeah there may

4552.56 --> 4561.56
have been unnecessarily the same one you

4555.5 --> 4569.68
know there's so many doctors just doing

4561.56 --> 4569.68
things this guy

4596.73 --> 4601.62
I think he might just be completely

4599.1 --> 4607.47
blotted out of my Google searches I

4601.62 --> 4610.46
can't find the right one I think I'm

4607.47 --> 4610.46
just being clumsy

4630.77 --> 4639.900000000001
okay well page you know at this point

4635.04 --> 4642.6
after all this you know give you know

4639.9 --> 4647.009999999999
what if conspiracy cats just wants to

4642.6 --> 4650.76
hold on to viruses then let him you know

4647.01 --> 4653.52
let him if he wants to believe in a

4650.76 --> 4656.55
viruses then go ahead you go and live in

4653.52 --> 4661.92
a world where viruses exist you have to

4656.55 --> 4664.35
be very scared and yeah while you're at

4661.92 --> 4667.77
it you might want to get Bill Gates's

4664.35 --> 4672.02
vaccine because if you take that it's

4667.77 --> 4678.21
said you'll never get a virus ever again

4672.02 --> 4682.71
so yeah mister biology if that is what

4678.21 --> 4686.01
it takes for you to if that is what you

4682.71 --> 4690.56
need to affirm to you that you are a

4686.01 --> 4694.320000000001
biologist and it's all really important

4690.56 --> 4700.639
viruses in oh it's really real and then

4694.32 --> 4704.19
you go and act upon it go ahead but yeah

4700.639 --> 4709.28
at this point you have what you have

4704.19 --> 4713.339999999999
read is all you know proves us wrong

4709.28 --> 4716.5199999999995
alright well I'm pretty sure you haven't

4713.34 --> 4719.63
even tried to read into the alternatives

4716.52 --> 4719.63
you haven't even tried that

4722.25 --> 4730.03
otherwise you wouldn't be so convinced

4724.78 --> 4732.16
like that unless you have just made up

4730.03 --> 4734.83
your mind that that's the way it's gonna

4732.16 --> 4737.44
be if that is what is official then that

4734.83 --> 4741.25
is reality and you'll lay down your life

4737.44 --> 4744.719
for that reality or go ahead lay down

4741.25 --> 4744.719
your life for that reality

4746.07 --> 4749.17

Missouri Bear

4808.26 --> 4815.610000000001
well huh well good surfing not

4811.41 --> 4819.0
necessarily corrupt peer-review doesn't

4815.61 --> 4823.62
mean corrupt it just means potentially

4819.0 --> 4832.47
subject to politicization it's as simple

4823.62 --> 4834.2699999999995
as that because it's not guaranteed

4832.47 --> 4838.820000000001
you know peer review can be good if all

4834.27 --> 4843.21
the peers are all while doing it right

4838.82 --> 4845.7
there's no sneaking and sneaky plans no

4843.21 --> 4850.8
political agenda to uphold or some

4845.7 --> 4854.66
strategy does any agenda or strategy is

4850.8 --> 4854.66
effectively politicization

4878.57 --> 4888.69
god this is so ridiculous now guys the

4886.05 --> 4891.119000000001
conspiracy cats is now in baller mode

4888.69 --> 4892.369
he's basically straw planning and gas

4891.119 --> 4898.049999999999
lighting all of you

4892.369 --> 4901.83
it's just ignore him seriously for how

4898.05 --> 4904.77
is it supposed to spread to a person to

4901.83 --> 4915.23
person it doesn't it's not how that

4904.77 --> 4918.860000000001
works it doesn't do anything it's just

4915.23 --> 4918.86
mechanism inside of you

4979.35 --> 4986.110000000001
don't strawman like that man I'm I'm

4982.57 --> 4988.33
getting kind of at the point where I'm

4986.11 --> 4990.91
considering banning you again conspiracy

4988.33 --> 4992.71
cats because the level of [ __ ] straw

4990.91 --> 4995.13
banning that's going on here is getting

4992.71 --> 4995.13
really annoying

5005.36 --> 5016.219999999999
yeah yeah fire ology is maybe you could

5011.03 --> 5020.889999999999
see it some other way maybe fire ology

5016.22 --> 5020.89
is pseudoscience how about that

5026.9 --> 5030.08
[Music]

5041.119 --> 5050.36
at least in the way it's being done

5045.199 --> 5055.25
right it's just this fire ology all

5050.36 --> 5058.4
pseudoscience maybe not but if it like

5055.25 --> 5062.84
any comes comes thing concerning direct

5058.4 --> 5066.219
viruses it would have to be because it

5062.84 --> 5066.219
just doesn't work like that

5072.36 --> 5078.03
yeah that's right that's right yeah

5076.14 --> 5083.01
bring out your doctor spread them all

5078.03 --> 5085.59
out let's go come on all you medical

5083.01 --> 5090.38
students all you have ready to go Sivan

5085.59 --> 5094.5
yay how dare you how dare you say that

5090.38 --> 5096.42
all this hard work for some paper that

5094.5 --> 5098.76
I'm gonna get a lot of money for a bed

5096.42 --> 5101.49
right how dare you say it's fake yeah it

5098.76 --> 5106.320000000001
is you're learning pseudoscience

5101.49 --> 5109.32
[ __ ] been disproven a guy that's

5106.32 --> 5113.19
part of disproving it it's taken to

5109.32 --> 5118.53
court big time and he won you won so

5113.19 --> 5121.32
good yeah that the media shoved the

5118.53 --> 5124.65
whole thing under the carpet even though

5121.32 --> 5128.28
it is officially known that that

5124.65 --> 5134.429999999999
happened you got to look for it dr.

5128.28 --> 5136.7699999999995
hammer yeah I know you don't like it

5134.43 --> 5139.320000000001
it's very painful to learn once again

5136.77 --> 5142.26
that you've put so much attention and

5139.32 --> 5146.849999999999
money and pride and all this stuff

5142.26 --> 5149.46
you've learned and then yeah again again

5146.85 --> 5156.06
there's just this thing in between there

5149.46 --> 5158.94
and it's [ __ ] it's [ __ ] but you

5156.06 --> 5163.47
learn it anyway because nobody told you

5158.94 --> 5165.75
it was [ __ ] never got a proper

5163.47 --> 5169.79
balance of information concerning that

5165.75 --> 5174.47
no you learn it as was presented

5169.79 --> 5174.47
congratulations you believed in viruses

5186.54 --> 5189.649
[Music]

5223.98 --> 5232.679999999999
a conspiracy cats how about this we've

5229.32 --> 5237.21
peer reviewed the concept of virus we

5232.68 --> 5239.16
reviewed it yeah me and my peers right

5237.21 --> 5242.45
here and on the internet a whole lot of

5239.16 --> 5246.75
people yeah we peer reviewed it and

5242.45 --> 5249.86
we've concluded its false how about that

5246.75 --> 5249.86
there's your peer review

5262.27 --> 5265.819
[Music]

5271.43 --> 5274.689
[Music]

5277.19 --> 5280.29
[Music]

5280.36 --> 5286.37
isn't that pair of you oh really

5283.37 --> 5288.92
so what is pair of you then I'm calling

5286.37 --> 5293.12
it pair if you know I know it's peer

5288.92 --> 5299.3
review so the word hit pair is very

5293.12 --> 5306.34
important I know so it is not pair of

5299.3 --> 5306.34
you so what is it then describe

5320.08 --> 5322.8
yeah

5325.56 --> 5339.17
that's right so yeah okay so what is

5335.19 --> 5345.629999999999
appear isn't there is in the pier

5339.17 --> 5350.01
basically a person another person or is

5345.63 --> 5352.37
this is this some exclusive person like

5350.01 --> 5356.24
not everybody can be repaired a

5352.37 --> 5358.95
scientist you say oh and what is that is

5356.24 --> 5362.219999999999
that somebody that abides to the

5358.95 --> 5365.28
scientific method is that somebody that

5362.22 --> 5367.9800000000005
has a piece of paper of a certain type

5365.28 --> 5371.099999999999
of organization that they that that

5367.98 --> 5376.219999999999
basically qualifies them for being a

5371.1 --> 5376.22
peer reviewer is that what that is

5380.45 --> 5387.32
would ya of a wait for a response first

5417.69 --> 5424.419999999999
that's that that's very funny but I was

5422.02 --> 5429.160000000001
actually waiting for a real answer

5424.42 --> 5434.86
because I'm inquiring here about this

5429.16 --> 5438.4
supposed peer that should be reviewing

5434.86 --> 5441.48
somebody right reviewing something in

5438.4 --> 5448.889999999999
order to establish if that is correct

5441.48 --> 5448.889999999999
right so why can't I be appear

5453.7 --> 5460.36
you know that so what if there are

5457.09 --> 5463.6
certain peers that review something say

5460.36 --> 5465.3099999999995
yeah that's totally legit then well then

5463.6 --> 5470.59
it's peer reviewed but what if there's

5465.31 --> 5472.660000000001
other peers that say no no this yeah

5470.59 --> 5474.610000000001
it's a nice concept but here and here

5472.66 --> 5478.96
and here there are certain things that

5474.61 --> 5481.92
that have not been proven so the premise

5478.96 --> 5488.2
is incorrect

5481.92 --> 5489.7300000000005
is it still peer reviewed I think it

5488.2 --> 5492.28
would be you know because they're still

5489.73 --> 5494.29
peers reviewing it except they disagree

5492.28 --> 5496.8099999999995
or they prove to the contrary is it

5494.29 --> 5500.19
still peer reviewed then or would that

5496.81 --> 5502.93
be a matter of what's gonna be

5500.19 --> 5505.179999999999
registered to be out there like what if

5502.93 --> 5507.52
the peers that agreed with it would be

5505.18 --> 5509.05
all published and like mentioned

5507.52 --> 5511.360000000001
everywhere linked to the concept

5509.05 --> 5513.64
constantly what if those people that

5511.36 --> 5515.589999999999
disagree and still had a lot of

5513.64 --> 5519.070000000001
information to back that disagreement up

5515.59 --> 5520.900000000001
what if they were then not published

5519.07 --> 5522.759999999999
everywhere and referenced in all the

5520.9 --> 5530.65
databases every time the subject came up

5522.76 --> 5533.47
as an alternative to the concept is that

5530.65 --> 5535.75
still legitimate then as a pair of you

5533.47 --> 5539.26
when I'd know something that would

5535.75 --> 5543.58
disprove it has been excluded from the

5539.26 --> 5546.42
peer review situation what about that

5543.58 --> 5546.42
conspiracy cats

5562.38 --> 5567.150000000001
alright see conspiracy cats is not

5564.96 --> 5575.51
addressing any of the questions here is

5567.15 --> 5575.509999999999
just it's just paying a troll right now

5589.01 --> 5593.43
that's gaslighting in a straw man you

5591.93 --> 5595.8
don't know anything about that

5593.43 --> 5598.02
you're just asserting [ __ ] about what

5595.8 --> 5602.25
other people do now conspiracy catch you

5598.02 --> 5606.09
don't know how Paige if Paige goes to

5602.25 --> 5608.43
the doctor for anything what do you do

5606.09 --> 5610.53
what do you know about it you seem to be

5608.43 --> 5613.950000000001
assuming all kinds of things based on

5610.53 --> 5618.33
the premise that we're rejecting virus

5613.95 --> 5620.61
theory like that that means we're all

5618.33 --> 5621.48
just savages and all that this is

5620.61 --> 5625.219999999999
ridiculous

5621.48 --> 5625.219999999999
where do you come up with this

5643.039 --> 5650.349
like why would we not talk to doctors

5646.459 --> 5653.898999999999
even you know the difference between

5650.349 --> 5657.019
people like me and some other flat

5653.899 --> 5660.589
earthers out there is that we don't

5657.019 --> 5662.929
believe a lot of the mainstream media

5660.589 --> 5666.379
medical approach you know we take our

5662.929 --> 5668.359
own action to take care of our body and

5666.379 --> 5671.749
figure it out but that doesn't mean that

5668.359 --> 5677.479
like old doctors are now like the temple

5671.749 --> 5679.579
of death or something no that's that's

5677.479 --> 5681.319
kind of an exaggeration just because

5679.579 --> 5683.389
doctors can be wrong through the

5681.319 --> 5685.76
material they've studied and learned at

5683.389 --> 5690.559
certain aspect does it mean it's all

5685.76 --> 5694.129
worthless it's ridiculous I'm still not

5690.559 --> 5696.829000000001
gonna do my own surgery well maybe if I

5694.129 --> 5698.899
had no other choice I would attempt it

5696.829 --> 5702.648999999999
but yeah I don't know anything about

5698.899 --> 5708.049
that or barely yes I don't even want to

5702.649 --> 5710.119000000001
think about it but so yeah this is

5708.049 --> 5712.809
you're taking things out of proportion

5710.119 --> 5712.808999999999
here

5719.39 --> 5722.4400000000005
Oh God

5755.59 --> 5772.610000000001
I'm gonna round up the show by the way

5757.909 --> 5776.36
soon getting kind of hungry okay Paige

5772.61 --> 5779.69
I'm not gonna allow you to bite into

5776.36 --> 5781.88
this troll situation stop it these

5779.69 --> 5783.709
literally gaslighting and straw Manning

5781.88 --> 5786.650000000001
you and every response you give to that

5783.709 --> 5790.4
is just gonna make it worse it's gonna

5786.65 --> 5796.07
collector my Chad I don't want it don't

5790.4 --> 5798.909
do that the best response is silence

5796.07 --> 5809.42
because he is just being apathetic

5798.909 --> 5812.179
gaslighting troll stop it so anyway
