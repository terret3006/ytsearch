97.56 --> 102.869
yeah today the weather is quite a

99.9 --> 110.25
contrast to yesterday and this overall

102.869 --> 114.32
look at look at that clear sky just this

110.25 --> 114.32
picture look at that

116.67 --> 119.84
that's just amazing

128.52 --> 136.64000000000001
no chemtrails what so ever beautiful

141.05 --> 156.51000000000002
it is cold though it is not really warm

146.51 --> 159.75
yeah beautiful day and oh and I have a

156.51 --> 165.09
lot with me this day this time I got to

159.75 --> 172.61
Mara coffee right there tea I got up I

165.09 --> 180.26
got blueberries tangerine and an

172.61 --> 185.22000000000003
Illuminati photo right there because

180.26 --> 188.22
yeah I had an unexpected bonus like

185.22 --> 192.6
completely out of the blue but

188.22 --> 196.17
apparently my my tax agents from the

192.6 --> 199.92
government has somehow figured out how

196.17 --> 202.82
to give me sizable amount of money out

199.92 --> 207.17999999999998
of nowhere and that suddenly completely

202.82 --> 213.57
pulled me out of the red for sure so I

207.18 --> 218.01000000000002
was just like like what again feel very

213.57 --> 224.31
lucky and yeah thought I'd celebrate

218.01 --> 227.16
with some some goodies but I don't know

224.31 --> 231.87
I don't know I should do an inquiry as

227.16 --> 234.45
to like how how was that done I haven't

231.87 --> 238.56
received a letter from usually I get a

234.45 --> 240.48
letter from them after that declaring

238.56 --> 244.29
what it is because I'm really curious I

240.48 --> 248.97
hope alright well I think from a

244.29 --> 252.89999999999998
preliminary thought I think that it was

248.97 --> 254.91
probably due to the income coming in

252.9 --> 257.85
through Google being paid back and then

254.91 --> 259.96999999999997
there's some kind of bureaucratic system

257.85 --> 264.09000000000003
in order to still get some back of that

259.97 --> 265.95000000000005
because I it basically put down or well

264.09 --> 269.42999999999995
thanks to you guys to all of your

265.95 --> 270.87
support really I got pretty big chunks

269.43 --> 272.06
of money from there that I had to pay

270.87 --> 273.919
back again and I

272.06 --> 276.83
that this might be a little bit back

273.919 --> 280.99
it's not all of it but still yeah was

276.83 --> 286.82
over $300 or 300 euros it's just like

280.99 --> 290.6
okay I can now start the repairs as it

286.82 --> 292.82
were literally I'm getting two of my

290.6 --> 294.77000000000004
shoes repaired because I need they

292.82 --> 297.74
needed it and yeah it's going to be a

294.77 --> 300.59
repair time and paying off certain debts

297.74 --> 305.93
that were just brewing and all that and

300.59 --> 308.03
then and we can move on but at least

305.93 --> 310.61
this is the read the financial read

308.03 --> 315.10999999999996
situation for this month is definitely

310.61 --> 319.46000000000004
over thank God and thank everyone for

315.11 --> 325.31
your support and thank the tax agent for

319.46 --> 327.979
doing that so yeah and and the beautiful

325.31 --> 332.419
weather and I had a ye very long night

327.979 --> 338.33
rest very very long I think 11 hours

332.419 --> 344.26
total went to bed before 12:00 got up 11

338.33 --> 347.75
and I feel really good

344.26 --> 351.02
again no cheese yesterday as well and I

347.75 --> 354.34
think I I really yeah what I said

351.02 --> 354.34
yesterday is gonna stand

356.85 --> 362.91900000000004
[Music]

358.479 --> 365.37899999999996
okay Lottie Mae yeah that's that was

362.919 --> 368.00899999999996
what I thought as well but I don't know

365.379 --> 368.009
how it works

373.66 --> 385.37
yes sir Rita cause it see what I mean

378.46 --> 394.66999999999996
and this yeah that's that's my life for

385.37 --> 397.76
some reason it it still works anyway it

394.67 --> 403.52000000000004
doesn't mean that I'm rich now yeah I'm

397.76 --> 407.65999999999997
just got lucky that's how I see it keep

403.52 --> 410.87
on going oh yeah yeah yeah I think that

407.66 --> 418.24
Riley was taking a piss at his audience

410.87 --> 418.24
for a bit with that video the heathen I

418.48 --> 433.15000000000003
was just so silly that's right Effy what

423.05 --> 437.0
is the meaning of life well meaning is

433.15 --> 439.88
personal and thereby meaning of life is

437.0 --> 447.2
a matter of perspective literally from

439.88 --> 451.94
the moment but you could try to rephrase

447.2 --> 457.72999999999996
it in the more permanent context and say

451.94 --> 461.89
what is and say that purpose is that

457.73 --> 461.89000000000004
which guides life

464.81 --> 475.86
so that's my attempt to answering that

468.33 --> 479.419
question yeah damn

475.86 --> 479.41900000000004
sorry to Cosentino

484.85 --> 490.689
yeah

486.879 --> 494.619
Oh Jimmy Jedi hey yeah sure sure I've

490.689 --> 504.78900000000004
got you on let me get let me read the

494.619 --> 513.8190000000001
chat ah oh right so you mean what is the

504.789 --> 517.8
purpose of creation it is - it is the

513.819 --> 525.61
unique experience of creation itself I

517.8 --> 534.7589999999999
think I don't know it's pretty heavy

525.61 --> 537.3100000000001
questions out of nowhere um yes yes

534.759 --> 539.0790000000001
Lottie says the Dutch airplane thing was

537.31 --> 546.0999999999999
a false alarm yesterday that's what the

539.079 --> 548.56
news said so it's like somebody pushed

546.1 --> 550.2090000000001
the wrong button or whatever that's how

548.56 --> 553.0889999999999
they say that's funny that you mentioned

550.209 --> 556.5089999999999
because I for some reason watch the news

553.089 --> 558.639
for just one clip yesterday don't do

556.509 --> 563.529
that that often but sometimes I just do

558.639 --> 565.66
so I did catch that one why don't you

563.529 --> 568.12
buy new shoes yeah good point julieopp

565.66 --> 570.79
happen because well these types of shoes

568.12 --> 571.66
that I am used to wearing are kind of

570.79 --> 578.23
expensive

571.66 --> 581.37
I think they cost between 80 and 90

578.23 --> 581.37
euros a pair

582.32 --> 588.49
but that I do yeah I

589.27 --> 594.22
I wear them for a long time so for me

592.029 --> 596.14
it's the long-term investment it's worth

594.22 --> 599.47
it but I just don't have that kind of

596.14 --> 610.66
investing room and repairing is not that

599.47 --> 617.35
expensive really ha yeah you got that

610.66 --> 619.209
right menace 2 sobriety the necessary

617.35 --> 623.47
antecedent for gas pressure is a

619.209 --> 626.3499999999999
container indeed or you could say that

623.47 --> 639.01
it is contained and the only way we know

626.35 --> 642.82
how to contain gas is by a container no

639.01 --> 643.63
I don't ever wear wooden shoes isn't

642.82 --> 646.5100000000001
that terrible

643.63 --> 650.98
I hate them sorry and I don't literally

646.51 --> 653.26
ate them but yeah a long time ago I did

650.98 --> 659.35
go to like farms and I did try them out

653.26 --> 662.05
I just I don't like it maybe if it's

659.35 --> 664.3290000000001
like a really hot summer's day they

662.05 --> 667.24
would kind of help and I guess that they

664.329 --> 671.2299999999999
are useful if like the farm grounds are

667.24 --> 674.64
a bit muddy and everything I think but

671.23 --> 678.1
as for walking on stone that that it's

674.64 --> 684.3
painful almost yeah I just don't like

678.1 --> 684.3000000000001
those freaking wooden shoes anyway

693.81 --> 699.4799999999999
right I should read how Chad and and I

697.199 --> 704.3
need to call Jimmy Teddy I call I'm

699.48 --> 704.3000000000001

728.069 --> 735.42
it all goes through Skype and they and

732.93 --> 740.67
yeah there are usually a few audio

735.42 --> 745.199
issues but I try to manage my volumes my

740.67 --> 747.899
levels ok chat it's allowed to too soft

745.199 --> 752.9699999999999
it's probably a little soft compared to

747.899 --> 755.73
mine I hope there's no echo ok ATM says

752.97 --> 756.8090000000001
there's a perfect reception so let's go

755.73 --> 762.059

775.199 --> 781.1099999999999
leeuwin still did I hear you say you

777.959 --> 784.3789999999999
need a cobbler a cobbler

781.11 --> 788.639
as you may see repair yeah but I know

784.379 --> 791.5790000000001
there I know one there's cobblers all

788.639 --> 795.2090000000001
over the place oh well that's a dying

791.579 --> 797.16
art in America really oh there's no I

795.209 --> 798.5089999999999
don't I don't think there's been a

797.16 --> 803.279
cobbler for a hundred years

798.509 --> 805.8000000000001
you're right what a waste it's a great

803.279 --> 808.25
profession and it's multifunctional

805.8 --> 809.779
there's so much you could do with it and

808.25 --> 812.42
yeah

809.779 --> 814.889
you know and if you don't have lit I

812.42 --> 818.189
barely go there to actually have

814.889 --> 820.49
something worked on my shoe but I get go

818.189 --> 825.92
there for advice I go there for like

820.49 --> 825.92
what is it laces that kind of thing or

828.36 --> 838.12
these things what do you call them again

831.13 --> 840.58
pantaloons ER so yeah that's usually

838.12 --> 842.41
what they had what they do here and I

840.58 --> 845.6500000000001
don't know they're they're everywhere I

842.41 --> 848.02
could name on the top of my mind least

845.65 --> 852.85
like four places here in Utrecht where

848.02 --> 855.8199999999999
they're so and probably like ten anyway

852.85 --> 864.91
our shoes are so cheap here we just

855.82 --> 866.0200000000001
throw them away get new ones hmm loafers

864.91 --> 869.8299999999999
sorry Tina

866.02 --> 872.35
sorry toe Cosentino calls it okay yeah

869.83 --> 875.35
well are you bringing it over 50 viewers

872.35 --> 880.24
wow you've you've grown quite a bit when

875.35 --> 882.73
she started yeah well yeah compared to

880.24 --> 890.35
the flatter talk days I definitely have

882.73 --> 892.78
yes but yeah but yeah indeed I do get it

890.35 --> 895.3000000000001
well it has ups and downs moments it

892.78 --> 897.1
really depends on on the mood of

895.3 --> 900.3299999999999
everyone so something that I do notice

897.1 --> 903.94
that certain days especially Fridays

900.33 --> 906.7900000000001
that like everybody just goes ballistic

903.94 --> 908.74
in the evenings and like everywhere chat

906.79 --> 911.41
activity so many people watching and

908.74 --> 913.21
then the next bring in my early bird s

911.41 --> 918.28
like almost nobody there you can almost

913.21 --> 920.38
feel the hangovers everywhere but then

918.28 --> 928.27
eventually yeah in the evening everybody

920.38 --> 930.4
comes back in but yeah I'm very happy

928.27 --> 933.01
with the amount of viewers I get these

930.4 --> 935.35
days and I'm also surprised that I'm

933.01 --> 937.18
apparently interesting enough for so

935.35 --> 942.87
many people to keep on watching like

937.18 --> 947.76
really okay it's better numbers than the

942.87 --> 947.76
24/7 lives yet

948.0 --> 952.41
well which one which beam uh well

950.97 --> 956.25
there's a couple leave at the discord

952.41 --> 959.73
you got PPC people's pirate channel

956.25 --> 964.41
they're running every day and they only

959.73 --> 969.149
usually bring in 20 maybe 30 tops on a

964.41 --> 972.98
real dramatic day okay

969.149 --> 976.259
but is that in certain time periods or

972.98 --> 979.3190000000001
literally 24/7 there's like 30 around

976.259 --> 980.61
because for a 24/7 is usually an average

979.319 --> 983.579
of 15 or 20

980.61 --> 987.149
Wow that's still a lot you know I to be

983.579 --> 989.4899999999999
fair I do this what roughly one hour a

987.149 --> 993.439
day sometimes a lot more sometimes a

989.49 --> 997.889
little less but if I did like a non-stop

993.439 --> 1000.949
24 hour 7 show I yeah I'd run out of

997.889 --> 1002.72
steam and then people why would you hang

1000.949 --> 1005.389
around eventually you know it's that's

1002.72 --> 1008.3000000000001
just the problem is it's it becomes a

1005.389 --> 1010.25
big empty room okay I have 24 hours of

1008.3 --> 1013.699
content all right actually you're gonna

1010.25 --> 1016.49
go off-road you gonna get silly DNA of

1013.699 --> 1020.2299999999999
wonky you know it happens yes we can put

1016.49 --> 1023.0
that kind of output right and and for me

1020.23 --> 1026.51
even starting out the earlybird show as

1023.0 --> 1029.15
a daily thing it felt like oh I have to

1026.51 --> 1033.589
be careful I can't underestimate this

1029.15 --> 1035.6000000000001
because yeah every day you know but it

1033.589 --> 1038.569
seems to be working out I have sometimes

1035.6 --> 1041.2089999999998
a bit quiet moments where I just like I

1038.569 --> 1043.01
can't see anything interesting but then

1041.209 --> 1045.949
somebody in chat just throw something

1043.01 --> 1048.289
out and I get going again and and other

1045.949 --> 1051.19
days I'm super inspired and God all

1048.289 --> 1056.39
kinds of stories ready for it to go and

1051.19 --> 1059.21
yeah I don't know that plays a big role

1056.39 --> 1061.789
yeah it does gonna play off the chat

1059.21 --> 1065.0
they play off you and it's quite the

1061.789 --> 1067.82
dynamic that is very needed right well I

1065.0 --> 1072.049
take my chat very serious and that's

1067.82 --> 1076.34
also wife laid out pretty I guess strict

1072.049 --> 1078.649
rules for how how we people wield that

1076.34 --> 1081.289
chat on average and

1078.649 --> 1084.559
yeah I pay a lot attention to two

1081.289 --> 1086.629
individuals behavior I kind of like in

1084.559 --> 1089.6
my mind some that don't take this creepy

1086.629 --> 1092.12
but I kind of profile them keep keep

1089.6 --> 1094.279
tabs and then just see like are they

1092.12 --> 1095.87
actually improving are they actually

1094.279 --> 1098.809
learning something or are getting are

1095.87 --> 1100.4289999999999
they getting worse or if something

1098.809 --> 1103.1589999999999
suddenly happened you know sometimes

1100.429 --> 1106.3400000000001
people go nuts out of nowhere and then

1103.159 --> 1108.0800000000002
you think like what the hell I'll have

1106.34 --> 1109.85
they turn evil but it could be that

1108.08 --> 1111.529
something really bad in their life

1109.85 --> 1113.809
happened and they can't share it and

1111.529 --> 1116.659
they're going nuts from it but you know

1113.809 --> 1119.99
that afterwards by them basically being

1116.659 --> 1122.509
like oh [ __ ] what did I do you know what

1119.99 --> 1124.879
I hate right that happened it happened

1122.509 --> 1129.47
to a lot of people including myself

1124.879 --> 1132.619
me too right so but then there's the

1129.47 --> 1136.759
people that certainly do that and they

1132.619 --> 1138.799
don't recover they don't start to feel

1136.759 --> 1141.049
shame no they just keep on doubling down

1138.799 --> 1143.59
and that's when you know okay this is

1141.049 --> 1152.139
just bad and and that's why how they did

1143.59 --> 1152.139
still doing shout out to Schulman re

1152.499 --> 1161.48
all you fellas so I got some I got a

1157.039 --> 1166.039
bunch of messages the day after that I

1161.48 --> 1167.929
was on Nathan's and you know brought up

1166.039 --> 1170.96
a little bit of that religious stuff

1167.929 --> 1173.72
mm-hmm and a lot of people just I wasn't

1170.96 --> 1175.94
expecting it they were like hey man you

1173.72 --> 1177.769
were asking the right questions that was

1175.94 --> 1181.999
awesome they need to be challenged on

1177.769 --> 1186.759
this they seemed to like so Stern and

1181.999 --> 1190.789
firm and that and people feel very very

1186.759 --> 1194.539
intimidated to to even step into the

1190.789 --> 1196.429
ring with Bible the arguing because they

1194.539 --> 1201.08
don't want to get blasted by Christians

1196.429 --> 1203.749
and and berated it's something people

1201.08 --> 1205.26
want to talk about people who people

1203.749 --> 1207.69
enjoyed

1205.26 --> 1210.87
the topic I was bringing up that day

1207.69 --> 1212.6100000000001
apparently I thought I was being a

1210.87 --> 1214.649
little bit of a jerk the way I was being

1212.61 --> 1217.1689999999999
received I was like I might be in jerky

1214.649 --> 1220.62
I didn't think I was being jerky but nah

1217.169 --> 1223.7990000000002
you were being a little red herring ye

1220.62 --> 1226.1899999999998
into speculative territory and nathan is

1223.799 --> 1228.809
just growing super intolerant of that

1226.19 --> 1232.5900000000001
even lashes out at me when I do it

1228.809 --> 1234.09
sometimes even though I really carefully

1232.59 --> 1237.09
try to prepare it's like yeah I know

1234.09 --> 1239.1589999999999
this is all solid this is the win but I

1237.09 --> 1241.47
just want to take it peak in that

1239.159 --> 1243.3300000000002
presupposition you read you there and

1241.47 --> 1247.669
then sometimes I went is not the right

1243.33 --> 1253.1999999999998
timing he's just like no shut up Arwen

1247.669 --> 1257.8500000000001
but you know that's just how he does it

1253.2 --> 1260.8990000000001
and it's it's you have yeah there's just

1257.85 --> 1263.4599999999998
a very strict interface and you have to

1260.899 --> 1265.2299999999998
I've been a listener of Nathan's for a

1263.46 --> 1266.8500000000001
long time I mean I used to join back in

1265.23 --> 1268.82
the day but that was when as soon as you

1266.85 --> 1273.059
joined the panel they was sniping you

1268.82 --> 1275.61
right the sniping days yeah so I've been

1273.059 --> 1277.71
a listener now that I'm participating on

1275.61 --> 1281.789
the panel I got to learn the groove and

1277.71 --> 1285.0
Nathan's tolerances and preferences so I

1281.789 --> 1289.139
catered to the host and what they want

1285.0 --> 1292.799
right yeah it's gonna take a little bit

1289.139 --> 1297.059
I suppose but I'll get that mm-hmm yeah

1292.799 --> 1298.889
but look it's just that a lot of people

1297.059 --> 1300.72
the flat earthers I'll call them

1298.889 --> 1302.1299999999999
including you and many others that have

1300.72 --> 1305.49
activities outside of the Flat Earth

1302.13 --> 1307.38
debates you are just used to being with

1305.49 --> 1309.69
a bunch of people you kind of know each

1307.38 --> 1311.3400000000001
other and you just talk and you just

1309.69 --> 1313.38
keep on talking and the conversation

1311.34 --> 1316.1999999999998
goes wherever that's what you're used to

1313.38 --> 1318.48
that's not that's just not possible at

1316.2 --> 1321.419
Nathan's it rarely is unless everybody

1318.48 --> 1325.38
just vented and there's just a moment of

1321.419 --> 1327.6000000000001
silence but yes it's you can't just have

1325.38 --> 1332.25
a regular conversation there it's really

1327.6 --> 1335.379
class with class rules kind of thing and

1332.25 --> 1341.899
I'm used to the unrefined schoolyard

1335.379 --> 1344.149
right where I'm like a babysitter all

1341.899 --> 1346.07
right well that's kind of how my show is

1344.149 --> 1349.2489999999998
I think that or at least when I have

1346.07 --> 1351.4399999999998
globe or guests on that I do it like

1349.249 --> 1360.44
with Brenda last time did you see that

1351.44 --> 1363.049
one know what always happens well in

1360.44 --> 1365.3890000000001
this case yeah she well what she does is

1363.049 --> 1367.07
because she kind of knows I'm being nice

1365.389 --> 1369.559
and I'm not gonna change that no matter

1367.07 --> 1372.979
what she does because I understand her

1369.559 --> 1375.83
tactic she then always just immediately

1372.979 --> 1377.8690000000001
breaks open another subject and because

1375.83 --> 1379.999
and she keeps on repeating that and she

1377.869 --> 1381.7099999999998
did that like because flat earth is

1379.999 --> 1383.509
triggering beef claws flat earth

1381.71 --> 1385.19
triggers you every time I blink bring up

1383.509 --> 1387.799
anything flatters related it triggers

1385.19 --> 1391.279
you so that's why she started asking me

1387.799 --> 1393.83
about dreams and I'm like oh sure I'll

1391.279 --> 1395.989
talk about dreams but then as she was

1393.83 --> 1398.869
asking and I try to explain it just

1395.989 --> 1400.999
became blatantly obvious that she just

1398.869 --> 1402.7389999999998
didn't understand anything what I was

1400.999 --> 1404.479
talking about she just and she kept on

1402.739 --> 1406.72
saying like I don't understand this I

1404.479 --> 1409.0900000000001
don't understand it's like it's not even

1406.72 --> 1412.46
federally related or anything and

1409.09 --> 1415.97
comparing it to all these references out

1412.46 --> 1422.299
there you know and she just doesn't get

1415.97 --> 1425.479
it it's yeah I don't know if because she

1422.299 --> 1427.519
just put her mind to like I am going to

1425.479 --> 1430.549
not understand this and use that

1427.519 --> 1434.629
politically against him kind of attitude

1430.549 --> 1437.33
because I think that she does that very

1434.629 --> 1439.2489999999998
strongly she really has like a social

1437.33 --> 1443.1689999999999
justice warrior heart at it very

1439.249 --> 1445.429
manipulative but or she's just

1443.169 --> 1448.8490000000002
unbelievably stupid but I just can't

1445.429 --> 1450.8790000000001
imagine she's but now she's too

1448.849 --> 1454.029
intelligent to be that stupid it's

1450.879 --> 1454.029
something else

1454.96 --> 1460.49
yeah are no trolling maybe I don't know

1458.63 --> 1463.8200000000002
but when they're chewing gelatin to be

1460.49 --> 1468.64
stupid it's gotta be trolling I don't

1463.82 --> 1473.24
know but what is the purpose of trolling

1468.64 --> 1475.73
self entertainment I think okay but is

1473.24 --> 1478.13
it self entertaining to constantly say I

1475.73 --> 1483.8600000000001
just don't get it I just don't

1478.13 --> 1485.63
understand if you react to it that's

1483.86 --> 1487.1599999999999
that becomes the entertainment I guess

1485.63 --> 1489.68
the negative reactions yeah but there is

1487.16 --> 1492.02
no negative reaction I just I didn't

1489.68 --> 1495.1100000000001
punish her for that I just said like

1492.02 --> 1497.3899999999999
come on it's like this they have never

1495.11 --> 1499.6699999999998
seen that it's like that but a little

1497.39 --> 1502.96
bit I was just extremely carefully

1499.67 --> 1505.73
explaining things as I do it's like I

1502.96 --> 1508.07
just don't understand that she didn't

1505.73 --> 1510.65
get that it it really seems like she

1508.07 --> 1515.1499999999999
just had her mind set I'm not getting

1510.65 --> 1520.16
what I was talking about on purpose so

1515.15 --> 1526.43
with Nathan show is he's bringing up the

1520.16 --> 1528.2
Bible taboo ah not necessarily but it is

1526.43 --> 1531.26
if you're gonna use it as a foundation

1528.2 --> 1531.5900000000001
for yeah for a scientific claim kind of

1531.26 --> 1534.41
thing

1531.59 --> 1536.09
well isn't it being done used as that by

1534.41 --> 1538.3400000000001
no people there

1536.09 --> 1541.1
nope I don't like the Bible's fact and

1538.34 --> 1543.05
I'm gonna cite the Bible to prove its

1541.1 --> 1545.98
fact you can't use the medium to prove

1543.05 --> 1545.98
the medium is real

1546.07 --> 1553.6699999999998
that's very raw use of that word it's

1550.31 --> 1554.81
look Bible is a pretty good reference

1553.67 --> 1558.89
okay

1554.81 --> 1561.4099999999999
reference yes yeah as in like a giant

1558.89 --> 1566.18
historical book by itself that's

1561.41 --> 1568.52
unmatched and man should use it as a

1566.18 --> 1570.68
reference I would never use it as okay

1568.52 --> 1575.06
is my presentation of Flat Earth proof

1570.68 --> 1578.96
that wouldn't be involved it is it is

1575.06 --> 1580.97
because well Thank You Julie activism

1578.96 --> 1582.98
stuff and when you bring up the Bible

1580.97 --> 1585.68
that when you get the eye rolls and they

1582.98 --> 1586.8700000000001
walk away yeah well don't present it

1585.68 --> 1589.3
like that then

1586.87 --> 1592.57
you got you gotta test your audience

1589.3 --> 1595.71
there is Christ allergies you you know

1592.57 --> 1598.81
that number that sounds funny it's not

1595.71 --> 1602.38
Christ's allergy is just as much allergy

1598.81 --> 1607.02
as as flatter of the allergy it's there

1602.38 --> 1610.2700000000002
it's been programmed I had it I had it

1607.02 --> 1612.34
okay so by the way Thank You Julie open

1610.27 --> 1616.02
for the five dollars you could shed the

1612.34 --> 1619.24
nation you'd have to turn and passionate

1616.02 --> 1620.98
it's God's Word being discussed it's not

1619.24 --> 1626.59
a subject you can throw around lightly

1620.98 --> 1628.45
just my opinion well we're not throwing

1626.59 --> 1633.6999999999998
it around lightly we're not joking about

1628.45 --> 1636.7
it so right but that doesn't mean that

1633.7 --> 1639.19
you constantly have to be in dread every

1636.7 --> 1641.6200000000001
time you will approach anything about it

1639.19 --> 1643.99
that's what I was talking about people

1641.62 --> 1646.4199999999998
feel intimidated they're they're afraid

1643.99 --> 1649.06
they're like oh I can't question it

1646.42 --> 1652.45
I can't ask questions I'm gonna get

1649.06 --> 1660.37
chewed out what if I do and that's I

1652.45 --> 1661.8400000000001
know to be able to discuss it it's say

1660.37 --> 1664.36
those who don't understand it the way

1661.84 --> 1667.87
others may understand it yeah but that's

1664.36 --> 1669.82
everyone yeah and that is slightly

1667.87 --> 1672.6399999999999
understood by hold on Julie that's

1669.82 --> 1675.4299999999998
widely understood about it it's an

1672.64 --> 1678.49
individual relation everybody that

1675.43 --> 1686.38
really takes his Christianity serious

1678.49 --> 1690.31
and finds this out as they go so but

1686.38 --> 1693.4
yeah I was bringing up the aspect of God

1690.31 --> 1696.3999999999999
being single and why can't I be plural

1693.4 --> 1698.5
and that was met with a lot of disdain

1696.4 --> 1701.91
and I don't really understand why and I

1698.5 --> 1704.71
want qyz atheism versus naturism

1701.91 --> 1706.8400000000001
presentation it was very good he

1704.71 --> 1709.1200000000001
definitely finished it in five ten

1706.84 --> 1712.51
minutes he didn't need to keep going and

1709.12 --> 1715.75
yeah an I think creation proves itself

1712.51 --> 1718.81
in itself evidence you don't really need

1715.75 --> 1719.94
to prove intelligent design as it's

1718.81 --> 1722.73
self-evident

1719.94 --> 1725.6100000000001
it should be it has to be self-evident

1722.73 --> 1729.33
just the complex patterns and fractals

1725.61 --> 1731.52
and your circulatory system like

1729.33 --> 1735.35
asteroids crashing into each other don't

1731.52 --> 1739.8899999999999
make circulatory systems right right

1735.35 --> 1742.1999999999998
yeah okay but but that's another area I

1739.89 --> 1745.2800000000002
can tell you exactly why they got so

1742.2 --> 1750.24
pissed off at you if you want to know

1745.28 --> 1752.34
because the mistake again I said it

1750.24 --> 1754.98
there I said it afterwards like the

1752.34 --> 1758.6699999999998
issue is the gradient versus the

1754.98 --> 1760.74
antecedent and what they would have a

1758.67 --> 1764.46
problem with is that you say but

1760.74 --> 1767.07
multiple creators but the thing is it's

1764.46 --> 1769.13
the we're talking they were referencing

1767.07 --> 1774.09
the antecedent and there can never be

1769.13 --> 1777.0300000000002
more than one it's just that's the

1774.09 --> 1781.05
natural antecedent consequence and it

1777.03 --> 1783.96
doesn't reveal what that is right

1781.05 --> 1786.36
that's like that's another hammer on top

1783.96 --> 1789.1200000000001
of it like you have to accept that that

1786.36 --> 1793.3799999999999
that does not reveal what it is it just

1789.12 --> 1795.09
is the logical consequence well and that

1793.38 --> 1799.8600000000001
doesn't explain anything about how the

1795.09 --> 1801.54
world manifested it is not related to

1799.86 --> 1804.87
the creation story

1801.54 --> 1808.29
it's the antecedent beyond all of it do

1804.87 --> 1811.4099999999999
you understand I don't know how it

1808.29 --> 1814.08
becomes the antecedent when like a thing

1811.41 --> 1818.01
about creating brand-new life because oh

1814.08 --> 1821.09
my god really creating brand-new life if

1818.01 --> 1824.58
there is nothing and it comes from

1821.09 --> 1828.99
something right from an intelligence

1824.58 --> 1832.82
that can only be one and it is not even

1828.99 --> 1832.82
a thing it's just one

1833.32 --> 1842.2
I get that in regards to biology that's

1840.13 --> 1844.0
nothing to do with biology well you have

1842.2 --> 1845.44
a single cell that divides it has

1844.0 --> 1848.59
nothing to do with biology you're

1845.44 --> 1853.15
talking about the gradient again it's

1848.59 --> 1859.98
about all of it everything on every

1853.15 --> 1859.98
level there can only be one at the start

1863.06 --> 1867.85
[Music]

1864.6 --> 1871.81
yeah I'd want to get there I'm trying to

1867.85 --> 1873.9399999999998
get there okay

1871.81 --> 1877.72
it's not about believing it's about

1873.94 --> 1881.2
understanding nature and how and also

1877.72 --> 1889.3
entropy in a way even entropy of them of

1881.2 --> 1892.57
the Spirit and are we are we physical

1889.3 --> 1900.61
first and spiritual second or spiritual

1892.57 --> 1901.8899999999999
first and physical second that's a

1900.61 --> 1907.4499999999998
matter of perspective

1901.89 --> 1910.48
I think spirits first material

1907.45 --> 1912.97
physicality is second that's just an

1910.48 --> 1916.03
opinion I mean you can't I can't prove

1912.97 --> 1918.28
any of that but well I think a lot of us

1916.03 --> 1920.26
lean that way the conscious is pretty

1918.28 --> 1924.49
much the spirit and since the

1920.26 --> 1926.29
consciousness drives all existence you

1924.49 --> 1932.31
could say yeah the spirit but without

1926.29 --> 1936.43
physical existence there is no spirit

1932.31 --> 1938.95
that's why what yeah how do we do a lot

1936.43 --> 1942.49
of body experiences then our body is

1938.95 --> 1946.3600000000001
still there when our spirits just not

1942.49 --> 1949.18
but that it's not about that now you're

1946.36 --> 1953.35
assuming that the consciousness can only

1949.18 --> 1957.69
exist within the specific region you're

1953.35 --> 1957.6899999999998
used to experiencing your consciousness

1957.9 --> 1962.19
well it on a body experience people say

1961.169 --> 1965.8200000000002
they see their body

1962.19 --> 1967.289
hey they're aware right things they're

1965.82 --> 1970.049
not in their body but their

1967.289 --> 1973.98
consciousness still is active and

1970.049 --> 1977.309
observing right I don't understand the

1973.98 --> 1981.63
part of where the eyes at the observer

1977.309 --> 1985.02
if the bodies on the table well why do

1981.63 --> 1987.0
you assume that that experience the

1985.02 --> 1992.07
participant is looking through their

1987.0 --> 1997.919
eyes they see themselves and what is

1992.07 --> 1999.99
that that's seeing well it's not eyes it

1997.919 --> 2003.73
can't be if the eyes are on the table in

1999.99 --> 2008.8700000000001
the body yet yet there is something seen

2003.73 --> 2012.5
right right so like mystery right but on

2008.87 --> 2018.85
the other hand there was no body there

2012.5 --> 2021.47
would be no out-of-body experience true

2018.85 --> 2024.08
exactly and that is the other side of it

2021.47 --> 2027.95
that's exactly the art so saying what is

2024.08 --> 2029.84
first you it's almost like look the the

2027.95 --> 2032.179
question what is first the body of the

2029.84 --> 2035.049
spirit it's like the question of the

2032.179 --> 2039.5900000000001
chicken and the egg it's a an

2035.049 --> 2041.929
unnecessary dichotomy and like oh by the

2039.59 --> 2043.76
way thank you again sorry sorry by the

2041.929 --> 2045.71
way thank you again Giulio Pavan for the

2043.76 --> 2048.98
$5 super chat donation we can all

2045.71 --> 2051.29
questions we can ask questions all day

2048.98 --> 2053.96
that's how you learn saying that the

2051.29 --> 2056.5099999999998
person who knows the Bible has to stern

2053.96 --> 2063.44
about as to be Stern about what

2056.51 --> 2066.26
information he gives right as far as

2063.44 --> 2070.639
they understand it you can only give out

2066.26 --> 2074.3
information referring to it in relation

2070.639 --> 2078.29
to how you understand it so yeah and

2074.3 --> 2081.23
just don't joke around with it and it's

2078.29 --> 2083.98
always also wise to realize that there's

2081.23 --> 2086.089
a lot more that you don't understand yet

2083.98 --> 2090.66
that's it in my opinion the best

2086.089 --> 2093.21
approach so yeah sorry for interrupting

2090.66 --> 2095.04
and the metaphor I could use with the

2093.21 --> 2098.4
body in the soul and the chicken and the

2095.04 --> 2102.24
egg let's say you're born you have to

2098.4 --> 2105.54
wait 16 years before you're able to have

2102.24 --> 2108.39
a driver's license and a car now your

2105.54 --> 2111.96
body gets a car you go into the car you

2108.39 --> 2114.96
drive that car you existed before the

2111.96 --> 2117.7200000000003
car you exist during the car and you'll

2114.96 --> 2120.57
exist after the car breaks down you get

2117.72 --> 2123.5099999999998
out of the car well let's let's put that

2120.57 --> 2126.1200000000003
good spirit where the spirit we get a

2123.51 --> 2129.51
body we use the body the body breaks

2126.12 --> 2130.5
down we step out of the body do we get a

2129.51 --> 2132.2700000000004
new car or not

2130.5 --> 2136.35
many cultures believe in reincarnation

2132.27 --> 2140.49
many don't I think that's a pretty good

2136.35 --> 2143.58
fractal metaphor I think for I would say

2140.49 --> 2146.1899999999996
the egg comes first all right right yeah

2143.58 --> 2152.5699999999997
but you're bypassing everything and what

2146.19 --> 2155.9700000000003
you're assuming is that the spirit and

2152.57 --> 2159.6600000000003
heaven and all of the other dimensions

2155.97 --> 2163.89
per default could exist entirely without

2159.66 --> 2166.43
physical material existence I'm not too

2163.89 --> 2166.43
sure about that

2166.58 --> 2177.12
well they do say reality is made up of

2170.82 --> 2181.4700000000003
light frequency vibration facto codes

2177.12 --> 2186.12
sacred geometry you can take substances

2181.47 --> 2189.7799999999997
DMT ayahuasca mushrooms but hold on do

2186.12 --> 2192.72
do that look we're not having the same

2189.78 --> 2194.1200000000003
discussion here I'm not saying that you

2192.72 --> 2196.74
don't exist

2194.12 --> 2199.74
even after you're dead or anything I'm

2196.74 --> 2204.2299999999996
not it's not even about that what I'm

2199.74 --> 2207.4199999999996
saying is that the condition for any

2204.23 --> 2211.35
existence of the spirit inside outside

2207.42 --> 2216.83
the body in some kind of eternity may by

2211.35 --> 2219.21
itself be bound by the very existence of

2216.83 --> 2221.25
physical reality in the first place

2219.21 --> 2224.19
there is no guarantee that all of that

2221.25 --> 2227.18
will exist without a physical reality

2224.19 --> 2232.71
to basically help it manifest that's

2227.18 --> 2234.69
what I'm trying to point at yeah there

2232.71 --> 2238.26
has to be this physicality for some

2234.69 --> 2241.7400000000002
reason to play out an experience right

2238.26 --> 2244.4100000000003
so what would all these heavens be if

2241.74 --> 2247.0789999999997
not basically a reflection from the

2244.41 --> 2249.089
experience in the physical well if all

2247.079 --> 2251.52
that physical isn't there anymore then

2249.089 --> 2260.24
how could there be a reflection of it in

2251.52 --> 2263.91
the heavens I don't know and that yeah

2260.24 --> 2266.7
but it's a pretty absolutely an extreme

2263.91 --> 2269.1299999999997
approach as in the total existence you

2266.7 --> 2271.799
know because time passes in the physical

2269.13 --> 2274.109
reality places can exist marvelous

2271.799 --> 2276.48
things could have been built or nature

2274.109 --> 2278.8489999999997
could have shown miracles and that could

2276.48 --> 2283.109
have died all that and that doesn't mean

2278.849 --> 2286.069
that it can't timelessly exist in the

2283.109 --> 2289.38
other dimension as it were in some way

2286.069 --> 2292.589
but what I'm then pointing at is that

2289.38 --> 2294.69
what if all material existence were over

2292.589 --> 2297.72
then all the things that could have

2294.69 --> 2300.38
existed in the material existence once

2297.72 --> 2305.0099999999998
and still reflect in the spiritual realm

2300.38 --> 2311.599
why would they still exist if they're

2305.01 --> 2314.9700000000003
like a reflection I don't know maybe

2311.599 --> 2317.63
this is a bit trippy this is not very

2314.97 --> 2321.27
biblical related in that senses more

2317.63 --> 2323.51
interdimensional pondering really so

2321.27 --> 2328.14
sorry for those in chat that are

2323.51 --> 2332.5690000000004
offended do you think we have outer

2328.14 --> 2332.569
realms outside of this

2335.53 --> 2342.11
maybe outer ponds as we like to call

2339.38 --> 2346.85
them at PPC the outer Ponder's other

2342.11 --> 2347.6
segments yeah yeah it could be to be

2346.85 --> 2349.8199999999997
fair

2347.6 --> 2351.7999999999997
as time passes I'm giving it less and

2349.82 --> 2355.31
less chance but there is still a chance

2351.8 --> 2358.73
and the thing is also that even if there

2355.31 --> 2362.62
was a chance how do we know that there

2358.73 --> 2364.91
would always be an opening I've even

2362.62 --> 2367.15
pointed this out in my rectangular

2364.91 --> 2371.21
looping concept that there could be

2367.15 --> 2372.8
segments at the at the pole gates as it

2371.21 --> 2375.83
were where where the loop would be

2372.8 --> 2378.77
tighter and that at times the loop could

2375.83 --> 2380.84
just close and there and then you

2378.77 --> 2382.82
couldn't go beyond you would just go in

2380.84 --> 2385.04
a circle yeah I thought about that

2382.82 --> 2387.4100000000003
cyclically opening closing of the doors

2385.04 --> 2389.5099999999998
they're like you don't know you know it

2387.41 --> 2391.1
could be like oh yes okay

2389.51 --> 2393.59
flatter if this being broken out

2391.1 --> 2395.66
everybody can go out and explore at some

2393.59 --> 2398.6600000000003
point and guess what when they go it

2395.66 --> 2401.45
explore oh that's exactly the time when

2398.66 --> 2402.92
all the gates are knowingly closed they

2401.45 --> 2405.7999999999997
could they could pull that kind of [ __ ]

2402.92 --> 2411.05
on us and then the mystery would be kept

2405.8 --> 2413.03
forever or for a very long time so you

2411.05 --> 2418.75
believe we have borders and those

2413.03 --> 2423.71
borders are likely guarded maybe but

2418.75 --> 2426.32
what how orders a North Pole border a

2423.71 --> 2428.3
South Pole border or well no no no not

2426.32 --> 2431.48
nothing to do with borders no it's just

2428.3 --> 2433.1000000000004
I was pointing out in a looping setting

2431.48 --> 2436.27
if the loop would be tighter at the

2433.1 --> 2441.47
poles then there is potentially a

2436.27 --> 2443.9
possibility that the loop can change in

2441.47 --> 2448.52
its width and even closed off so that

2443.9 --> 2450.37
for example now it seems like whatever

2448.52 --> 2454.81
was supposed to be there at the north

2450.37 --> 2458.5699999999997
it's literally not there anymore because

2454.81 --> 2462.23
because it's just people go around there

2458.57 --> 2463.9100000000003
on boats it really seems like there's

2462.23 --> 2468.47
just a big ocean and a bunch of ice

2463.91 --> 2471.17
there now so at some time it could be

2468.47 --> 2473.2999999999997
for that the loop was not closed and you

2471.17 --> 2476.78
could just move further north into the

2473.3 --> 2478.94
North Point and then move beyond or into

2476.78 --> 2481.34
the other realm and that that is what

2478.94 --> 2483.92
those drawings those maps were for but

2481.34 --> 2486.05
that's just not accessible anymore

2483.92 --> 2487.88
because the loop would be closed yeah

2486.05 --> 2491.5600000000004
and I want to know that for certain or

2487.88 --> 2494.81
not because it's just assumed maps have

2491.56 --> 2497.27
changed I don't know if through hiding

2494.81 --> 2499.79
the truth or what there's very old maps

2497.27 --> 2501.65
that show pretty much the same thing you

2499.79 --> 2504.77
have the four islands there at the north

2501.65 --> 2506.51
the four rivers run in the same thing

2504.77 --> 2508.609
mm-hmm we don't see that anymore

2506.51 --> 2514.6400000000003
especially how modern maps it seems like

2508.609 --> 2518.5099999999998
Google covers that up I know the

2514.64 --> 2521.5099999999998
military built a base 1950s at the North

2518.51 --> 2523.5200000000004
Pole and they were saying to protect us

2521.51 --> 2525.9500000000003
from invasions from the north they

2523.52 --> 2529.22
didn't say Russia they just said from

2525.95 --> 2531.41
the north so do you really think they

2529.22 --> 2533.5699999999997
built a base day with roads and tracks

2531.41 --> 2539.45
and shipping lanes and it's all

2533.57 --> 2543.6800000000003
underwater now no thanks I don't think

2539.45 --> 2546.14
so I think whatever was there it's

2543.68 --> 2549.109
probably still there closed off in its

2546.14 --> 2553.0989999999997
own closed off little realm and who

2549.109 --> 2555.8199999999997
knows they might even be able to see

2553.099 --> 2558.23
through the gate somehow they might be

2555.82 --> 2561.31
informed about what's going on over here

2558.23 --> 2563.96
they just can't move here physically

2561.31 --> 2566.27
yeah something like I need some civilian

2563.96 --> 2569.27
recon to see what's there from a

2566.27 --> 2571.88
civilian perspective not a corporate

2569.27 --> 2576.68
here's what's there which could be

2571.88 --> 2580.37
tainted civilian prospectus we need

2576.68 --> 2581.43
recon expedition I believe

2580.37 --> 2583.7999999999997
[Music]

2581.43 --> 2593.58
not too many people get past that but

2583.8 --> 2595.59
70th parallel up there I don't know I

2593.58 --> 2599.88
think we need exploration or else we're

2595.59 --> 2603.4700000000003
just gonna be guessing the area and

2599.88 --> 2609.21
going through old maps over and over

2603.47 --> 2612.6299999999997
becky ladings baiting well checking it

2609.21 --> 2617.3
out and also for me one of the important

2612.63 --> 2621.3
things is to truly get get it worked out

2617.3 --> 2626.28
what the celestial relations are really

2621.3 --> 2631.38
like how how do the latitude lines

2626.28 --> 2633.78
really match up with yeah with how the

2631.38 --> 2636.36
layout of the land and the ocean bottom

2633.78 --> 2642.0
is for real what how does it really work

2636.36 --> 2643.6200000000003
and then work from there on you

2642.0 --> 2649.89
mentioned ocean bottoms have you heard

2643.62 --> 2652.1099999999997
of abysmal planes yeah it's abysmal

2649.89 --> 2654.5699999999997
plane I believe it's called you can look

2652.11 --> 2658.56
it up in Wikipedia where it states the

2654.57 --> 2662.4
definition of that is more than 50% of

2658.56 --> 2667.32
the Earth's ocean is flat level alright

2662.4 --> 2669.84
right yes so they're telling you in the

2667.32 --> 2677.1800000000003
definition near it's flat just with

2669.84 --> 2677.1800000000003
abysmal plains of the oceans floor yeah

2677.48 --> 2682.23
they seem to do that a lot where they're

2679.98 --> 2684.23
telling you it's flat but it's the

2682.23 --> 2688.71
doublespeak

2684.23 --> 2690.9
well I think that they themselves that

2688.71 --> 2693.3
really do physical things with all the

2690.9 --> 2695.73
information do kind of want to keep it

2693.3 --> 2697.7400000000002
unpalatable don't want to accidentally

2695.73 --> 2700.05
slip in some ridiculous globe or

2697.74 --> 2706.5899999999997
machination and screw up their operation

2700.05 --> 2708.57
so you know yeah so where do you think

2706.59 --> 2711.83
we're headed with all this what's what's

2708.57 --> 2711.8300000000004
coming in the near future

2716.61 --> 2726.3900000000003
I think just a lot more political hassle

2724.47 --> 2728.6699999999996
from all sides and more pressure on the

2726.39 --> 2735.48
United States political system from all

2728.67 --> 2738.39
sides Europe brexit it's gonna yeah it's

2735.48 --> 2741.15
a like it's just a lot of pressure a lot

2738.39 --> 2742.1099999999997
of pressure a lot of frustrations

2741.15 --> 2747.0
everywhere

2742.11 --> 2748.77
and yeah that's it's already kind of

2747.0 --> 2751.05
been like that for a while it's just

2748.77 --> 2754.2599999999998
gonna get kind of worse really and at

2751.05 --> 2757.5
the same time people will also be as the

2754.26 --> 2760.92
pressure goes up try to diversify and

2757.5 --> 2763.86
find an escape that really escapes from

2760.92 --> 2765.87
that pressure situation so there will be

2763.86 --> 2770.3700000000003
more people probably also looking into

2765.87 --> 2772.68
Flat Earth but also more attempts to go

2770.37 --> 2774.66
into gaming or series or whatever it's

2772.68 --> 2777.93
just escapism the whole situation will

2774.66 --> 2780.6
really push on the need for escapism

2777.93 --> 2783.0
more and more and that's kind of what it

2780.6 --> 2787.11
also was designed to do there's groups

2783.0 --> 2790.68
anticipating all of this people will say

2787.11 --> 2792.54
that our Flat Earth stuff is a form of

2790.68 --> 2796.95
escapism we're trying to hide from

2792.54 --> 2800.31
reality or whatever I think that's it's

2796.95 --> 2803.6099999999997
the opposite quite actually you're kind

2800.31 --> 2806.79
of giving way to an observable provable

2803.61 --> 2808.23
reality we don't necessarily like I

2806.79 --> 2812.34
didn't want the earth to be flat

2808.23 --> 2817.17
turns out to be that way all right it's

2812.34 --> 2818.829
not a what I can't lie to myself all

2817.17 --> 2823.2200000000003
right

2818.829 --> 2826.55
yeah ya know it a flat earth look it is

2823.22 --> 2828.41
a quite a hobby to get through all the

2826.55 --> 2830.15
information it's a challenge it's very

2828.41 --> 2833.5699999999997
interesting it's psychologically

2830.15 --> 2835.4300000000003
challenging for anyone so there's just a

2833.57 --> 2838.55
lot of time that people spend on it when

2835.43 --> 2840.6499999999996
they get into it but that doesn't make

2838.55 --> 2843.6800000000003
it an escapism it may seem at first

2840.65 --> 2846.05
because it does almost get people

2843.68 --> 2847.5789999999997
obsessed with it sometimes because of

2846.05 --> 2851.5890000000004
the preponderance of all of it in the

2847.579 --> 2854.51
consequences but real escapism is

2851.589 --> 2858.43
different real escapism is usually in

2854.51 --> 2861.44
secret so you just keep on going

2858.43 --> 2864.77
pretending nothing's changed and then in

2861.44 --> 2868.2200000000003
your spare time you get off get the

2864.77 --> 2870.65
frustrations out of the way or just go

2868.22 --> 2873.3199999999997
in your little safe space comfort zone

2870.65 --> 2877.089
that you imagine for yourself kind of

2873.32 --> 2879.26
thing but that's not in the open and

2877.089 --> 2880.97
that's not what flat earth is like a

2879.26 --> 2885.5
nowhere did it's all out in the open

2880.97 --> 2890.7799999999997
Flat Earth is out in the open and those

2885.5 --> 2896.38
were the eyes to see it right it's not

2890.78 --> 2896.38
hidden really it's just not advertised

2898.18 --> 2902.14
escapism to me is going in back into the

2901.4 --> 2907.069
matrix

2902.14 --> 2911.24
I need a videogame watching a movie just

2907.069 --> 2914.96
that's escaping the actual reality flat

2911.24 --> 2917.75
stationary realm is it though for me it

2914.96 --> 2922.52
is at this point really because I watch

2917.75 --> 2926.75
Star Trek a lot o ne but it's not asked

2922.52 --> 2928.819
it doesn't escape me I'm just very it's

2926.75 --> 2932.63
like a painting to me it's like oh look

2928.819 --> 2935.089
at the beautiful painting suggestion it

2932.63 --> 2935.839
it doesn't work that part doesn't work

2935.089 --> 2938.27
anymore

2935.839 --> 2943.0
I could literally translate the whole

2938.27 --> 2947.39
series into a like a Renaissance going

2943.0 --> 2950.75
on the the ships to other countries and

2947.39 --> 2952.04
figure it like that because because it

2950.75 --> 2955.99
in a way it is kind of in

2952.04 --> 2959.24
spired on that on that set up on

2955.99 --> 2962.39
seafaring going around father finding

2959.24 --> 2965.99
other countries other cultures missed

2962.39 --> 2968.18
mysteries mystery plays right well na

2965.99 --> 2972.0499999999997
but pre Admiral Burton I'm talking about

2968.18 --> 2977.0
like way before industrialization that's

2972.05 --> 2980.36
the idea I tend to think Captain Kirk is

2977.0 --> 2983.6
a depiction of Admiral Berg youngest

2980.36 --> 2986.29
admiral in the fleet Captain Kirk was

2983.6 --> 2989.06
the youngest captain to ever have a ship

2986.29 --> 2991.79
exploring strange new lands five-year

2989.06 --> 2993.38
mission it's and then you have Auguste

2991.79 --> 2997.19
Piccard Captain Picard I'm just

2993.38 --> 3002.62
wondering if Star Trek is doing the

2997.19 --> 3006.25
space version of what history did yes

3002.62 --> 3009.2799999999997
that's what they do that's exactly what

3006.25 --> 3011.53
I pointed out it is all metaphorical

3009.28 --> 3015.2200000000003
it's the scientific it's science fiction

3011.53 --> 3020.1400000000003
eyes medium but it is all just human

3015.22 --> 3020.91
stories basically from the past and it's

3020.14 --> 3024.5499999999997
excellent

3020.91 --> 3026.92
it's a great invention some of the

3024.55 --> 3030.04
discoveries that were made by Admiral

3026.92 --> 3033.2200000000003
Byrd the actual episodes of Star Trek

3030.04 --> 3035.92
like certain other cultures certain like

3033.22 --> 3040.8999999999996
one of the first episodes in season one

3035.92 --> 3042.88
was those talking orbs that held the

3040.9 --> 3044.9500000000003
consciousness of those beings in the

3042.88 --> 3049.06
civilization that collapsed and now

3044.95 --> 3051.6699999999996
they're orbs you know and they kind of

3049.06 --> 3054.67
use the rainbow colors as they speak to

3051.67 --> 3056.5
you of course we have the phenomena UFOs

3054.67 --> 3058.6
in the orbs and things like that like

3056.5 --> 3061.24
where did they come up with these

3058.6 --> 3064.54
concepts back in the 1960s so they

3061.24 --> 3067.2999999999997
deriving from actual things that were

3064.54 --> 3072.04
discovered yes

3067.3 --> 3075.3700000000003
and hey those times that was basically

3072.04 --> 3078.37
the when the can of hallucinogens were

3075.37 --> 3081.49
open so trust me there's a lot of

3078.37 --> 3084.63
inspiration they got from that as well

3081.49 --> 3087.66
but indeed also

3084.63 --> 3093.09
you know it just seems most of these

3087.66 --> 3095.7
things are really repackaging an old

3093.09 --> 3101.13
scenario that is fascinating in history

3095.7 --> 3104.58
and then repainting it into a different

3101.13 --> 3107.85
context but the same experience yeah

3104.58 --> 3110.16
and that's like kind of the method and

3107.85 --> 3114.6
they applied it successfully in theirs

3110.16 --> 3116.79
whole like prepackaged systems for it

3114.6 --> 3118.95
like Star Trek has systems for their

3116.79 --> 3121.77
episodes there's like a spectrum of

3118.95 --> 3127.1099999999997
typical episodes that tend to come back

3121.77 --> 3130.44
in every new series so see the concepts

3127.11 --> 3133.83
come back in a new way and everything so

3130.44 --> 3136.53
well they'll a creative writing that -

3133.83 --> 3139.92
but no but it's not just that it's also

3136.53 --> 3144.42
that it just works for that system it

3139.92 --> 3146.01
it's the episode by episode story system

3144.42 --> 3147.9
and then it works when you do it like

3146.01 --> 3150.75
that if you're gonna have a very big

3147.9 --> 3153.54
continual super heavy personal

3150.75 --> 3156.81
development story with radical changes

3153.54 --> 3159.57
then it becomes much more difficult to

3156.81 --> 3162.99
just adapt an episode with that system

3159.57 --> 3165.8900000000003
then it becomes really just like a bit

3162.99 --> 3169.3999999999996
pointless or a distraction but yeah

3165.89 --> 3169.4
story building huh

3171.78 --> 3177.3390000000004
somebody gave me this the other day view

3174.069 --> 3180.7
heard a plane scape expansion from

3177.339 --> 3190.7799999999997
dungeons yeah yeah yeah very flattered

3180.7 --> 3199.6499999999996
Essene oh yeah oh you did yeah I have

3190.78 --> 3207.599
the book so I have the original

3199.65 --> 3207.599
depiction of it find it first

3225.42 --> 3229.44
yeah if anybody knew this I know it

3227.98 --> 3247.96
would be you

3229.44 --> 3248.589
yeah come to the right place yeah there

3247.96 --> 3254.859
you go

3248.589 --> 3258.94
Outlands yeah our lands that's the one

3254.859 --> 3263.589
right can you see that

3258.94 --> 3271.98
uh yeah yep yep that's it check that out

3263.589 --> 3278.74
right in the center - yes Tower of Babel

3271.98 --> 3281.17
well no well maybe in a way yeah what

3278.74 --> 3284.109
it's supposed to be is a giant Tower and

3281.17 --> 3287.7400000000002
on top of it is the literally the God of

3284.109 --> 3291.5789999999997
Magic's realm so it is like the ultimate

3287.74 --> 3295.24
uber wizard tower in the center of the

3291.579 --> 3297.52
galaxy of the inter planar realms that's

3295.24 --> 3303.22
what it's supposed to stand for

3297.52 --> 3306.07
I wonder where the concept came from it

3303.22 --> 3309.73
was a Wizards of the coast 1994 but I

3306.07 --> 3314.6800000000003
mean really though these people that

3309.73 --> 3317.26
super-wide research I think they

3314.68 --> 3321.19
probably studied like almost everything

3317.26 --> 3325.2400000000002
every religious scripture old stuff just

3321.19 --> 3329.19
look through all of it and then just try

3325.24 --> 3334.18
to put something amazing together as

3329.19 --> 3337.26
yeah as varied as possible you think

3334.18 --> 3347.98
Steve Jackson did the same thing for the

3337.26 --> 3350.8300000000004
Illuminati card set probably I think

3347.98 --> 3353.89
look the thing is in general what

3350.83 --> 3357.5499999999997
overall tends to come out and shine

3353.89 --> 3360.75
through on people is very late because

3357.55 --> 3363.9900000000002
for some reason there is just a

3360.75 --> 3367.66
systematic pre-planning going on

3363.99 --> 3370.5099999999998
worldwide on the higher levels and that

3367.66 --> 3373.75
way it's just some people just figure

3370.51 --> 3375.94
out through through some way how to see

3373.75 --> 3379.0
certain things coming like 20 years

3375.94 --> 3382.33
ahead because things are so rigidly

3379.0 --> 3384.369
planned or or just looked ahead people

3382.33 --> 3386.71
there's a lot of people spending a lot

3384.369 --> 3388.6000000000004
of time looking forward as what is

3386.71 --> 3390.609
inevitable to happen and then build

3388.6 --> 3393.79
their plan on that and then there's

3390.609 --> 3396.0699999999997
other people taking note of that and so

3393.79 --> 3401.17
things do become predictable because

3396.07 --> 3404.26
people have made it predictable does

3401.17 --> 3407.32
that make any sense in a lot of regards

3404.26 --> 3410.44
yeah I didn't I don't know how you could

3407.32 --> 3413.65
foresee the Pentagon on fire and in the

3410.44 --> 3417.25
towers falling because it was because

3413.65 --> 3421.869
it's part of a set it was like it was

3417.25 --> 3425.44
like a demonstration yeah they used it

3421.869 --> 3428.61
as a theatrical demonstration yeah to

3425.44 --> 3431.55
get hurt like Oh

3428.61 --> 3435.69
and yeah it was terrible for whatever

3431.55 --> 3439.4
exactly happened but they intended to

3435.69 --> 3443.76
use the drama of it specifically and

3439.4 --> 3447.69
that is also what immediately answers

3443.76 --> 3450.9
the question as to why what would they

3447.69 --> 3453.39
allow that to happen why or why would

3450.9 --> 3457.4100000000003
they plan why why would they eventually

3453.39 --> 3460.14
even count on that to happen because of

3457.41 --> 3467.19
the pre-planning and how crazy it

3460.14 --> 3476.8199999999997
sometimes get gets in secret right but

3467.19 --> 3478.83
yeah I hope Big Ben doesn't fall why

3476.82 --> 3480.75
would you say that that's in the card

3478.83 --> 3484.3199999999997
game oh really

3480.75 --> 3486.83
Jesus yeah Big Ben's collapsing London's

3484.32 --> 3486.8300000000004
on fire

3487.64 --> 3492.18
Nicholas seem to be just waiting for new

3490.17 --> 3495.51
cards to arrive flat-earthers knows

3492.18 --> 3497.97
something and as he Studios you know

3495.51 --> 3502.05
does it say anything about the not true

3497.97 --> 3506.58
Dom fires because I'm high you know what

3502.05 --> 3508.5600000000004
I thought it might have I want to insert

3506.58 --> 3510.6
something because I think it didn't

3508.56 --> 3512.91
because otherwise I would have heard it

3510.6 --> 3515.52
from somebody with the aluminum from

3512.91 --> 3518.8199999999997
mark Sargent pretty quickly but who

3515.52 --> 3519.81
knows maybe the designer knew something

3518.82 --> 3523.26
was gonna happen

3519.81 --> 3526.5299999999997
and he just guessed so maybe the Big Ben

3523.26 --> 3529.2900000000004
was his guest as to the landmark that

3526.53 --> 3532.38
would undergo this but in actuality it

3529.29 --> 3536.16
became not for them ever thought about

3532.38 --> 3539.6600000000003
that see maybe they're trying to rebuild

3536.16 --> 3546.8399999999997
them today and I have a hard time

3539.66 --> 3550.31
well there's plans for it but yet this

3546.84 --> 3553.05
was supposed to be built to win you know

3550.31 --> 3554.88
it's not yeah we can't you can't build

3553.05 --> 3557.1200000000003
any kind of rocket that goes to the moon

3554.88 --> 3558.88
anymore because we threw all that away

3557.12 --> 3564.45
this

3558.88 --> 3568.54
yeah yeah that's just silly

3564.45 --> 3570.79
hmm hey by the way wait it is Friday

3568.54 --> 3574.0
right yes so I think I'm gonna round out

3570.79 --> 3576.7599999999998
the show yeah hey thanks for nathan's

3574.0 --> 3579.28
right yeah exactly so I'll probably see

3576.76 --> 3580.78

3579.28 --> 3582.94
being on and yeah it was a great

3580.78 --> 3585.8500000000004
conversation very interesting so having

3602.62 --> 3607.72
was interesting

3604.86 --> 3610.96
sorry I didn't go through a lot of chat

3607.72 --> 3615.0099999999998
today and I did notice a couple of socks

3610.96 --> 3618.4900000000002
that I needed banning but yeah I never

3615.01 --> 3620.23
really called upon who was in chat so

3618.49 --> 3621.0899999999997
sorry for that yes a little bit late for

3620.23 --> 3626.62
