right

91.6 --> 95.19999999999999
so yeah the weather today has been

93.92 --> 99.36
kind of mixed

95.2 --> 99.36
it was kind of nice and clear earlier

99.68 --> 103.52000000000001
but now another cloud came over

106.0 --> 111.0
and it was like that yesterday as well

114.96 --> 119.28
and then like when i came back

117.36 --> 121.52
the second time because i did go out for

119.28 --> 123.68
groceries another time

121.52 --> 125.119
during fed it didn't really contribute

123.68 --> 127.28
much on fed

125.119 --> 130.0
this time

127.28 --> 132.0
yeah when i came back just

130.0 --> 135.52
one cloud

132.0 --> 138.16
and actually a hail came out of it

135.52 --> 140.84
and just one minute time i was

138.16 --> 143.84
completely doused it was kind of

140.84 --> 147.04
annoying so yeah there's these

143.84 --> 149.44
treacherous dark gray clouds in between

147.04 --> 153.35999999999999
everything and yeah

149.44 --> 153.35999999999999
rain and hill does come out of it

155.519 --> 158.64000000000001
but not right now

163.68 --> 166.84
all right

171.45 --> 175.51899999999998
[Music]

172.8 --> 177.04000000000002
hello kevlar first in chat crockett

175.519 --> 179.68
psych bear

177.04 --> 179.67999999999998
good to see you

180.159 --> 184.72
it is

181.44 --> 189.48
friday the 21st of july

184.72 --> 189.48
july january 2022.

191.519 --> 197.87900000000002
how's the temperature it's kind of

193.84 --> 197.879
cold watery cold

199.2 --> 204.959
i had a really rough night

201.84 --> 204.959
it's complicated

205.33 --> 209.32000000000002
[Applause]

208.319 --> 210.79899999999998
seven degrees

209.32 --> 213.84
[Music]

210.799 --> 213.84
could be worse i guess

219.76 --> 224.48
this month has flown by well it's not

221.84 --> 229.12
over just yet but yes january has gone

224.48 --> 229.11999999999998
very fast for a january month

232.879 --> 237.35999999999999
and i really hope my ancestral wind

235.519 --> 239.12
prediction will come true and that it

237.36 --> 240.87900000000002
will end

239.12 --> 243.519
after this

240.879 --> 246.319
because yeah even last night

243.519 --> 250.72
really i went to bed very early

246.319 --> 253.04
because i had an appointment today at 11

250.72 --> 254.959
so i wanted to get up a little extra

253.04 --> 258.799
early for that

254.959 --> 262.079
and went to bed early but then

258.799 --> 264.4
i was just haunted by zoom again and

262.079 --> 265.919
this time it was really bad it was so

264.4 --> 268.4
bad

265.919 --> 270.96
it it got so bad that it almost made me

268.4 --> 270.96
throw up

271.84 --> 275.03999999999996
it was really freaky

275.28 --> 279.11999999999995
it was this time it was really

277.04 --> 282.32
disturbing now whether i was extra

279.12 --> 286.0
sensitive to it for some reason or that

282.32 --> 288.32
it was actually stronger than usual

286.0 --> 290.639
it was just

288.32 --> 294.24
very disruptive and this morning i kind

290.639 --> 294.24
of feel still feel

295.04 --> 298.08000000000004
the remnant of it

301.6 --> 307.199
but i literally took a walk in the park

304.24 --> 309.199
after my appointment

307.199 --> 311.84000000000003
and that did me some good

309.199 --> 313.68
i love walking through that park

311.84 --> 315.52
it's not the same location i typically

313.68 --> 317.68
walk when i'm kind of sickish or

315.52 --> 320.08
something which is much closer by

317.68 --> 321.039
in that park there's all kinds of

320.08 --> 323.919
like

321.039 --> 326.08
well wild chickens just walking around

323.919 --> 328.79999999999995
of all kinds and if they're someone it's

326.08 --> 328.8
just so cute

329.44 --> 335.759
like really fluffy chickens and really

332.479 --> 340.56
more classical big chickens

335.759 --> 342.47900000000004
typical red ones and all kinds fluffy

340.56 --> 344.08
big small

342.479 --> 345.12
speckled

344.08 --> 347.44
it's just

345.12 --> 349.759
great walking through there

347.44 --> 351.44
and they have like mini zoo type

349.759 --> 353.36
situation too

351.44 --> 355.919
like pigs

353.36 --> 357.68
and deer there's actual deer in there

355.919 --> 359.59999999999997
and lamas

357.68 --> 361.52
so yeah

359.6 --> 363.28000000000003
i was just walking past there and just

361.52 --> 366.59999999999997
looking at all the animals that did me a

363.28 --> 366.59999999999997
lot of good

367.28 --> 371.67999999999995
and of course the fresh air very

369.199 --> 371.68
important

372.16 --> 375.84000000000003
you should show us the park one day

374.4 --> 379.15999999999997
maybe

375.84 --> 379.15999999999997
yeah maybe

383.12 --> 387.36
i

384.24 --> 389.6
i don't know i could perhaps

387.36 --> 392.16
try it one time

389.6 --> 393.91900000000004
to take my p900

392.16 --> 395.36
right because it is basically it is

393.919 --> 397.35999999999996
mobile it has

395.36 --> 399.91900000000004
filming capability

397.36 --> 402.319
and then like take it and

399.919 --> 403.35999999999996
go around the park and just show it i

402.319 --> 405.44
could

403.36 --> 407.36
like record do that

405.44 --> 408.88
might be it's pretty good idea actually

407.36 --> 412.0
i might do that at some point but i'm

408.88 --> 412.0
going to wait until it's like

414.319 --> 421.03900000000004
yeah either much more beautiful sunny so

417.84 --> 423.039
you can really see all the

421.039 --> 424.71999999999997
all that holographic light

423.039 --> 427.12
cascading there

424.72 --> 429.28000000000003
or until it's like springtime but it's a

427.12 --> 433.44
good idea i'll do that you know i can

429.28 --> 436.15999999999997
still do that with my p900

433.44 --> 438.24
but yeah i'm not like oh i got a mobile

436.16 --> 440.639
and then it's like oh i feel like it

438.24 --> 442.319
whip it out and just start filming no no

440.639 --> 444.8
if i'm going to do that i'm going to

442.319 --> 447.44
have to plan to do that

444.8 --> 451.40000000000003
don't exactly carry a p900 around in

447.44 --> 451.4
your in your back pocket

451.44 --> 453.919
anyway

458.88 --> 461.759
jeff gas hat good to see you hope you're

460.72 --> 465.84000000000003
doing well

461.759 --> 465.84000000000003
flat accord music good to see you

466.4 --> 469.4
right

480.72 --> 486.24
somebody in discord yesterday said i

482.72 --> 489.84000000000003
look like garbage mel well after my

486.24 --> 489.84000000000003
after show smurfs

490.4 --> 495.28
analogy that's not surprising to me at

493.12 --> 495.28000000000003
all

496.879 --> 502.8
right difference though is i have hair

499.28 --> 504.96
and i will have hair for quite a while

502.8 --> 508.24
anyway i don't even know how

504.96 --> 511.68
old gargamel's supposed to be

508.24 --> 511.68
in the smurfs but whatever

516.64 --> 522.24
but yeah gargamel can get really pissed

518.959 --> 525.8389999999999
off too and so can i

522.24 --> 525.839
i had a cat called astro

531.12 --> 536.9590000000001
and you don't make smurfs right

534.399 --> 540.24
i was just i made an analogy during the

536.959 --> 544.3199999999999
after show so you yeah it'll pop up like

540.24 --> 545.6800000000001
uh tomorrow during the premieres

544.32 --> 548.399
like

545.68 --> 551.3599999999999
the way globers and atheists and all

548.399 --> 554.32
that use science right the modern

551.36 --> 556.5600000000001
approach of this is really a culture and

554.32 --> 558.88
if you just replace the word science

556.56 --> 560.56
with smurf

558.88 --> 563.12
then suddenly

560.56 --> 566.0799999999999
it starts to make a lot more sense as to

563.12 --> 567.279
how they're all doing it

566.08 --> 570.72
because yeah

567.279 --> 573.12
once you smurf you can smurf anything

570.72 --> 573.12
you know

574.32 --> 578.72
the body of smurfette compels you

582.88 --> 588.24
right

584.32 --> 588.24
so yeah smurfs science

588.48 --> 592.16
there are smurfs these scientists that

591.36 --> 593.92
think

592.16 --> 595.92
they're scientists they're more like

593.92 --> 598.16
smurfs

595.92 --> 600.4799999999999
and they think they can science anything

598.16 --> 603.519
they can smurf anything right because

600.48 --> 603.519
everything is smurf

603.68 --> 606.3199999999999
see

604.72 --> 608.399
see how

606.32 --> 610.48
incredibly

608.399 --> 613.12
well that fits

610.48 --> 615.6800000000001
once just when she lay the comparison

613.12 --> 618.24
so yeah that's probably why somebody on

615.68 --> 621.64
discord called me gargamel

618.24 --> 621.64
it's not surprising

636.16 --> 639.16
um

646.34 --> 649.46
[Music]

653.279 --> 658.64
all right so yeah yesterday's show was

656.079 --> 658.64
pretty good

659.2 --> 663.6
i fashioned the title

661.36 --> 666.64
after that

663.6 --> 666.64
after afterward

667.92 --> 671.1999999999999
the smurfer test

672.56 --> 677.76
this the smurf at your calculator

675.12 --> 677.76
how about that

679.76 --> 683.76
i mean the smurf model has to have

682.0 --> 685.36
smurfed here

683.76 --> 688.36
so there should be a smurf at your

685.36 --> 688.36
calculator

702.72 --> 707.6
that's your halloween cat i don't wear

704.88 --> 710.32
halloween costumes

707.6 --> 710.32
chosen one

711.04 --> 716.12
i always wear pretty much the same thing

719.04 --> 723.519
i mean if it's hot

720.639 --> 726.839
then i'll just get a white shirt that's

723.519 --> 726.839
about it

730.71 --> 733.859
[Music]

758.399 --> 760.72
hmm

768.88 --> 772.8
right

770.48 --> 774.72
anyway yeah i have whipped out this

772.8 --> 776.16
title for today's show

774.72 --> 778.72
came up with that

776.16 --> 778.7199999999999
yesterday

779.519 --> 785.2
although i don't really have

782.24 --> 789.04
content for it as a concept but i think

785.2 --> 789.0400000000001
i've just discovered something

789.76 --> 796.079
that's an interesting thing to ponder on

792.639 --> 796.88
spiritual credit score

796.079 --> 797.92
right

796.88 --> 800.399
because

797.92 --> 801.68
oh everybody's all

800.399 --> 803.92
like oh

801.68 --> 806.399
social credit score and

803.92 --> 810.0
it's being forced on us

806.399 --> 811.44
through the qr systems and blah blah

810.0 --> 813.44
yeah

811.44 --> 816.8000000000001
right but

813.44 --> 821.0400000000001
did anybody even realize that god is

816.8 --> 822.959
also keeping a spiritual credit score

821.04 --> 824.8
god's watching

822.959 --> 827.76
you have a credit score based on what

824.8 --> 830.7199999999999
you do not on what you seem to be doing

827.76 --> 832.56
to the outside world

830.72 --> 835.76
right

832.56 --> 837.1199999999999
and god's very meticulous

835.76 --> 838.88
so i

837.12 --> 842.839
thought like yeah that's kind of like a

838.88 --> 842.8389999999999
spiritual credit score

846.399 --> 851.56
oh it's not real yeah yeah you're not

848.56 --> 851.56
real

876.32 --> 880.0
yeah god's definitely real whether you

879.04 --> 882.3199999999999
deal

880.0 --> 884.639
with him or not

882.32 --> 886.0
and he will deal with you one way or the

884.639 --> 889.36
other and doesn't mean he's going to

886.0 --> 892.48
punish you for not believing him right

889.36 --> 896.639
because god knows

892.48 --> 899.44
man can't handle him

896.639 --> 902.16
can't handle his information because god

899.44 --> 906.24
gives all information he's the spreader

902.16 --> 908.7199999999999
of all information every idea you get

906.24 --> 908.72
every

908.8 --> 912.88
vision

909.92 --> 916.3199999999999
it all comes from god the sole source of

912.88 --> 919.519
all information all of it no exception

916.32 --> 921.6800000000001
all information throughout all ages

919.519 --> 923.72
is directly from god

921.68 --> 925.3599999999999
we're merely the receivers

923.72 --> 928.24
[Music]

925.36 --> 930.24
but god gives out

928.24 --> 933.279
more information than we typically

930.24 --> 933.279
consciously handle

933.6 --> 939.6800000000001
we get it all but

936.16 --> 942.8
we don't really deal with it all

939.68 --> 945.279
right we're usually ending up

942.8 --> 948.16
dealing with what we can deal with with

945.279 --> 950.48
our most direct

948.16 --> 952.7199999999999
priorities and all that

950.48 --> 955.04
and things that

952.72 --> 956.1600000000001
seem out of reach we kind of like forget

955.04 --> 958.079
about it

956.16 --> 960.7199999999999
that's a natural behavior

958.079 --> 963.5999999999999
because we can't handle it all

960.72 --> 965.839
but god does give it all

963.6 --> 966.8000000000001
right and i've discovered personally

965.839 --> 970.0
something

966.8 --> 972.4799999999999
about that and that is that

970.0 --> 974.36
if you just realize that

972.48 --> 977.6
then you can actually

974.36 --> 980.16
retroactively access all information

977.6 --> 982.5600000000001
god's ever given to you

980.16 --> 983.92
even when you had shutters on when you

982.56 --> 985.7589999999999
ignored it

983.92 --> 987.36
right because when you ignore something

985.759 --> 989.6800000000001
you forget about it in the moment it

987.36 --> 992.72
doesn't arrive in your consciousness you

989.68 --> 994.8
move away from it but that doesn't mean

992.72 --> 996.32
that it had not been transmitted and

994.8 --> 1000.24
received

996.32 --> 1000.24
there's like a record of it

1001.12 --> 1003.92
in your memory

1005.12 --> 1011.32
did god make gays yes

1007.92 --> 1011.3199999999999
yes he did

1011.36 --> 1016.0
right god

1012.56 --> 1016.0
makes many challenges

1017.44 --> 1022.839
and yeah gay is a type gay is a way

1021.839 --> 1024.72
that

1022.839 --> 1027.52
exists and

1024.72 --> 1029.76
yeah it has pitfalls

1027.52 --> 1032.6399999999999
and it has some benefits but yeah the

1029.76 --> 1034.72
long-term pitfalls are

1032.64 --> 1036.16
quite profound

1034.72 --> 1039.039
why

1036.16 --> 1041.3600000000001
because he wanted to

1039.039 --> 1041.36
yeah

1041.439 --> 1045.76
god likes to challenge everything

1047.12 --> 1052.08
it's all if it's there it's there for a

1049.679 --> 1055.3600000000001
reason

1052.08 --> 1055.36
there for you to deal with

1055.44 --> 1062.88
that's right gay is a choice

1057.84 --> 1062.8799999999999
is he gay himself no but you're banned

1062.96 --> 1068.08
god doesn't have any sexuality he

1066.0 --> 1071.28
doesn't need to

1068.08 --> 1073.9189999999999
something that is all things

1071.28 --> 1075.9189999999999
does not need sexuality sexuality

1073.919 --> 1080.8400000000001
requires

1075.919 --> 1080.8400000000001
incompletion otherwise there's no point

1085.2 --> 1089.3600000000001
sexuality is

1086.88 --> 1092.48
the connector

1089.36 --> 1094.9599999999998
to different things god does not need

1092.48 --> 1096.96
that he is all things

1094.96 --> 1100.24
he is it all

1096.96 --> 1102.96
there's nothing for him to connect to

1100.24 --> 1107.799
like that on an equal footing on a

1102.96 --> 1107.799
personal footing there's nothing

1117.2 --> 1120.32
right

1118.559 --> 1122.96
but again

1120.32 --> 1125.76
for this troll

1122.96 --> 1129.039
obviously distracted me

1125.76 --> 1132.0
all the information you've ever gotten

1129.039 --> 1134.96
is not lost right

1132.0 --> 1136.96
when i was younger i assumed you get

1134.96 --> 1139.919
information

1136.96 --> 1144.64
and then you have to pick up whatever

1139.919 --> 1144.64
you can because everything else is lost

1145.6 --> 1150.3999999999999
kind of like how a machine inquires it's

1148.32 --> 1151.84
just it gets through the data and there

1150.4 --> 1154.72
might be all kinds of things going on

1151.84 --> 1156.8799999999999
but if it's not connecting the data then

1154.72 --> 1158.64
it that data does not exist to the

1156.88 --> 1160.5590000000002
computer that's kind of how i thought it

1158.64 --> 1163.5200000000002
used to be

1160.559 --> 1165.9189999999999
i was very wrong about that although

1163.52 --> 1168.48
that thought was very much on the

1165.919 --> 1170.64
surface of my consciousness not in my

1168.48 --> 1172.799
deeper being because my deeper being my

1170.64 --> 1175.919
subconscious

1172.799 --> 1179.84
i think pretty much knows

1175.919 --> 1179.8400000000001
more than enough about reality

1180.08 --> 1184.48
but my con my actual consciousness has

1182.24 --> 1187.2
always been following

1184.48 --> 1190.559
my subconscious around because my my

1187.2 --> 1193.28
conscience cannot handle as much

1190.559 --> 1195.6789999999999
i'll be honest about it very

1193.28 --> 1198.6399999999999
sensitive

1195.679 --> 1202.16
so i can't handle it all consciously

1198.64 --> 1202.16
but my subconscious does

1203.12 --> 1207.52
does know

1204.799 --> 1210.0
it seems

1207.52 --> 1212.1589999999999
right but the thing is

1210.0 --> 1214.32
everything i've ever experienced

1212.159 --> 1216.7990000000002
i remember

1214.32 --> 1219.4399999999998
it's not that i that it's like a

1216.799 --> 1221.52
building block very easily retrievable

1219.44 --> 1224.0
for me

1221.52 --> 1227.2
but it all existed it has

1224.0 --> 1230.48
it's all been recorded

1227.2 --> 1233.8400000000001
and if it's necessary

1230.48 --> 1237.1200000000001
if the spirit is attuned to something

1233.84 --> 1240.6399999999999
then it connects to those memories even

1237.12 --> 1243.9189999999999
though i could never consciously

1240.64 --> 1245.919
seize those memories

1243.919 --> 1248.3200000000002
they're still there

1245.919 --> 1251.44
and i trust that now i understand that

1248.32 --> 1253.36
and it's how i've been able to

1251.44 --> 1256.64
explain and understand things even

1253.36 --> 1258.8799999999999
though before that very second

1256.64 --> 1260.72
i've not consciously dealt with it at

1258.88 --> 1263.3600000000001
all

1260.72 --> 1265.3600000000001
it's like suddenly i just

1263.36 --> 1268.559
i rip open a can

1265.36 --> 1271.28
of like 20 year old experience

1268.559 --> 1272.799
that i completely did not consciously

1271.28 --> 1274.8799999999999
remember

1272.799 --> 1278.4
it just happens

1274.88 --> 1280.48
and i've been kind of like stacking jars

1278.4 --> 1282.64
since i was a very little kid because i

1280.48 --> 1285.52
knew and was very frustrated that there

1282.64 --> 1286.159
was very little i could actually do with

1285.52 --> 1288.559
it

1286.159 --> 1290.96
in that time

1288.559 --> 1293.52
very incapable

1290.96 --> 1294.799
i mean i was very capable for a kid of

1293.52 --> 1297.039
my age

1294.799 --> 1299.84
but for what i could see that it all

1297.039 --> 1303.039
really was and that needed to be done i

1299.84 --> 1305.6
felt utterly incapable

1303.039 --> 1308.32
of dealing with it all

1305.6 --> 1311.1999999999998
my consciousness could not handle it

1308.32 --> 1313.4399999999998
but my subconscious was just stacking

1311.2 --> 1317.4
jars

1313.44 --> 1317.4
and i got a lot of jars

1320.159 --> 1322.88
what the hell

1322.96 --> 1327.4
oh flat accord music what are you doing

1337.52 --> 1345.48
i take it that was a pocket man accident

1341.679 --> 1345.48
flat accord music

1351.12 --> 1353.76
i uh

1355.039 --> 1358.559
can i get some confirmation of

1358.84 --> 1364.3999999999999
that otherwise i might be forced to take

1361.84 --> 1364.3999999999999
your wrench

1373.12 --> 1379.52
all right but it was it a pocket man

1377.6 --> 1380.48
man all right all right all right no no

1379.52 --> 1383.96
worries

1380.48 --> 1383.96
no harm done

1386.66 --> 1389.8290000000002
[Music]

1395.3 --> 1401.839
[Music]

1410.48 --> 1416.4
uh well psych bear

1414.0 --> 1419.039
you're asking here could it be that all

1416.4 --> 1421.679
these pen pricks give these babies and

1419.039 --> 1423.679
kids and chemicals of food soap changing

1421.679 --> 1424.88
hormone balance

1423.679 --> 1426.72
no

1424.88 --> 1427.7600000000002
not

1426.72 --> 1430.32
just

1427.76 --> 1432.64
giving them stuff is not gonna make them

1430.32 --> 1432.6399999999999
gay

1433.12 --> 1437.76
it's

1434.24 --> 1440.159
cultural imprint it's the behavioral

1437.76 --> 1442.4
pattern that they reflect themselves

1440.159 --> 1445.2
that they crystallize their own behavior

1442.4 --> 1448.24
by the example that is given to them

1445.2 --> 1450.32
that is what makes them gay or rather

1448.24 --> 1453.6
that's what makes it very appealing for

1450.32 --> 1456.9189999999999
them to choose gay because they choose

1453.6 --> 1456.9189999999999
they choose

1458.24 --> 1462.559
yeah

1459.12 --> 1465.039
so if you make an overwhelming

1462.559 --> 1467.84
presentation for them all their lives

1465.039 --> 1470.0
that gay is the only way

1467.84 --> 1471.039
yeah you heard it yeah guess what

1470.0 --> 1472.64
they're gonna

1471.039 --> 1475.44
turn out to be

1472.64 --> 1479.039
they'll be militantly gay because they

1475.44 --> 1481.1200000000001
think that's their duty

1479.039 --> 1482.64
you understand

1481.12 --> 1484.6399999999999
that's how it works it's not the

1482.64 --> 1486.72
chemicals and [ __ ] the chemicals and all

1484.64 --> 1487.8400000000001
that that comes afterward

1486.72 --> 1490.24
right

1487.84 --> 1492.3999999999999
when they decide oh i have to be if the

1490.24 --> 1493.6
opposite sex what can i do about it and

1492.4 --> 1495.8400000000001
then they'll be informed and then

1493.6 --> 1498.7199999999998
they'll be like oh give me the soy or

1495.84 --> 1498.72
something right

1499.52 --> 1505.6
now if you just give a kid

1501.679 --> 1507.2
or a baby all that crap soy

1505.6 --> 1509.279
it's just gonna kind of make them sick

1507.2 --> 1513.279
it doesn't make them gay they might like

1509.279 --> 1517.52
start to show weird effeminate behavior

1513.279 --> 1517.52
but that doesn't make them gay

1517.6 --> 1522.9189999999999
it just kind of makes them gay in

1519.6 --> 1522.9189999999999
another way

1529.44 --> 1533.6000000000001
but i don't think that that's really

1531.2 --> 1533.6000000000001
happening

1534.159 --> 1540.0
yeah unless you have like it

1536.96 --> 1541.1200000000001
parents that really do like a trans kids

1540.0 --> 1543.2
thing

1541.12 --> 1545.6789999999999
in a very young age you write that but

1543.2 --> 1548.88
that is just

1545.679 --> 1550.5590000000002
yeah i don't think that's really normal

1548.88 --> 1552.96
like only

1550.559 --> 1556.279
like clinically insane people do that to

1552.96 --> 1556.279
their own children

1572.48 --> 1574.88
anyway

1581.679 --> 1586.3200000000002
all right adam price yes sorry to hear

1583.44 --> 1588.4
your connection still sucks

1586.32 --> 1590.1589999999999
but if everything's okay you could still

1588.4 --> 1592.64
just watch the show

1590.159 --> 1594.5590000000002
afterward

1592.64 --> 1596.72
i mean

1594.559 --> 1601.6789999999999
i recently checked out another show that

1596.72 --> 1603.76
i did and yeah it's a very decent watch

1601.679 --> 1607.64
to just watch it afterward it's not

1603.76 --> 1607.64
really that bad at all

1642.88 --> 1645.2
right

1645.44 --> 1650.64
but again this whole gay thing or rather

1648.559 --> 1653.039
homosexual

1650.64 --> 1656.64
just taking

1653.039 --> 1659.679
like these toxic influences and

1656.64 --> 1662.24
hormone situations

1659.679 --> 1665.1200000000001
like that doesn't make you gay it makes

1662.24 --> 1668.1200000000001
you perhaps effeminate

1665.12 --> 1668.12
something

1668.88 --> 1671.1200000000001
but

1671.279 --> 1673.84
that

1672.559 --> 1676.1589999999999
yeah

1673.84 --> 1679.4399999999998
i mean it might make you

1676.159 --> 1680.5590000000002
more comfortable around gays

1679.44 --> 1683.3600000000001
right

1680.559 --> 1685.6789999999999
but it doesn't necessarily like make you

1683.36 --> 1688.8799999999999
into a gay

1685.679 --> 1688.88
it's always a choice

1690.48 --> 1694.24
until you've convinced yourself that it

1692.48 --> 1695.3600000000001
isn't a choice that you were born that

1694.24 --> 1698.08
way

1695.36 --> 1700.399
and then you deprive yourself of the

1698.08 --> 1703.96
realization that it is a choice from

1700.399 --> 1703.9599999999998
that point on

1718.48 --> 1721.48
first

1741.679 --> 1747.24
just in case anyone here has engaged in

1744.0 --> 1747.24
gay activity

1752.08 --> 1754.399
yeah

1754.48 --> 1758.799
that you can pay the gay away but you

1760.559 --> 1764.6399999999999
it's still going to be about choice

1762.399 --> 1764.6399999999999
though

1764.72 --> 1768.96
i'm very adamant about that right

1772.799 --> 1777.279
yeah you can also by the way

1775.36 --> 1779.279
paypal me

1777.279 --> 1782.679
that also helps to

1779.279 --> 1782.679
pay the gateway

1832.799 --> 1836.799
right but anyway yeah the other andrew

1834.72 --> 1838.08
like all these influences

1836.799 --> 1840.32
yeah they're not

1838.08 --> 1843.52
they're not good for you

1840.32 --> 1846.72
as you said you can become irritable

1843.52 --> 1849.52
more easily panicked

1846.72 --> 1852.48
more obsessive behavior don't forget

1849.52 --> 1854.0
about that one huh

1852.48 --> 1855.919
but

1854.0 --> 1858.88
that doesn't make you gay there's

1855.919 --> 1858.88
regular people

1859.12 --> 1862.399
that

1860.159 --> 1865.3600000000001
have issues with that as well which are

1862.399 --> 1866.6399999999999
not gay they might just be kind of gamma

1865.36 --> 1868.7199999999998
or something

1866.64 --> 1870.88
right look at them they have all these

1868.72 --> 1872.96
massive issues

1870.88 --> 1874.24
and i'm pretty sure that their diet is

1872.96 --> 1876.72
not helping

1874.24 --> 1880.159
because most gammas get stuck in like

1876.72 --> 1882.96
addictive type diet situations where

1880.159 --> 1885.8400000000001
they cause themselves more havoc

1882.96 --> 1886.64
like they drink too much coffee or they

1885.84 --> 1889.039
eat

1886.64 --> 1890.48
they get addicted to soy latte or

1889.039 --> 1893.039
something you know

1890.48 --> 1894.96
something that actually aggravates it

1893.039 --> 1897.96
and gets them more agitated more

1894.96 --> 1897.96
obsessive

1907.519 --> 1914.44
yeah on the other android you realize

1909.279 --> 1914.44
that if you say no homo that's gay

1928.4 --> 1931.489
[Music]

1936.48 --> 1941.32
right

1938.32 --> 1941.32
anyway

1956.0 --> 1959.0
uh

1973.12 --> 1977.6789999999999
reprogramming yeah i know

1975.679 --> 1982.159
it's

1977.679 --> 1982.159
it's the marxist cultural revolution

1982.88 --> 1990.2
and it's also corporation driven it's

1986.399 --> 1990.1999999999998
savage and evil

1991.76 --> 1995.36
i mean

1992.96 --> 1996.3990000000001
if people want to be gay and doing their

1995.36 --> 1999.9189999999999
gay little

1996.399 --> 2001.039
gay club or whatever gross

1999.919 --> 2004.5590000000002
or just

2001.039 --> 2005.519
weird fun whatever not so gross i don't

2004.559 --> 2007.6
know

2005.519 --> 2009.519
you know if they want to do that i i

2007.6 --> 2012.6399999999999
don't want to stop them

2009.519 --> 2015.36
i just don't want that [ __ ] to be forced

2012.64 --> 2017.039
on everyone

2015.36 --> 2019.519
through media

2017.039 --> 2021.76
and through schools

2019.519 --> 2025.1200000000001
and through corporate advertisement

2021.76 --> 2027.679
every that's the part where i'm highly

2025.12 --> 2030.7199999999998
objecting right

2027.679 --> 2033.44
i never wanted to erase all gays from

2030.72 --> 2036.32
society i just kind of want them to

2033.44 --> 2038.88
leave us the [ __ ] alone or leave me the

2036.32 --> 2043.6
[ __ ] alone in general

2038.88 --> 2044.72
now in person no gay bothers me anymore

2043.6 --> 2048.159
right

2044.72 --> 2051.839
but adds god adds

2048.159 --> 2052.639
like half the ass are just gay

2051.839 --> 2056.72
or

2052.639 --> 2057.9190000000003
it's like gay or super anti-white

2056.72 --> 2060.3199999999997
which is

2057.919 --> 2062.6389999999997
weird

2060.32 --> 2066.7200000000003
and i'm so sick of all that right i just

2062.639 --> 2067.839
want the manipulation to end i want that

2066.72 --> 2069.839
that

2067.839 --> 2072.879
artificially

2069.839 --> 2074.879
created chism

2072.879 --> 2077.5989999999997
that's being

2074.879 --> 2080.0789999999997
forced upon the psyche of the general

2077.599 --> 2081.52
public i want that to end

2080.079 --> 2084.2400000000002
it has to end

2081.52 --> 2088.0
it's terrible

2084.24 --> 2090.56
the long-term destructive influences are

2088.0 --> 2093.119
not to be underestimated and we already

2090.56 --> 2095.04
know it because it's been ravaging

2093.119 --> 2097.44
for decades now

2095.04 --> 2099.119
and you can see some of the people what

2097.44 --> 2102.56
they are doing right now how they

2099.119 --> 2105.28
conduct themselves it has ravaged

2102.56 --> 2105.2799999999997
the people

2111.68 --> 2115.44
okay clap ruckus oh that's good for you

2114.56 --> 2118.32
that

2115.44 --> 2120.64
homophobic is a joke well it's not a

2118.32 --> 2124.0
joke to me though right

2120.64 --> 2127.52
because i'm not scared of gays

2124.0 --> 2129.2
it's just that it makes me viscerally

2127.52 --> 2131.44
sick

2129.2 --> 2133.2799999999997
yeah

2131.44 --> 2136.8
it causes an

2133.28 --> 2136.8
over stress reaction

2137.76 --> 2142.88
it's not i but i'm not viable to panic

2141.04 --> 2144.56
like that

2142.88 --> 2146.96
i just get sick

2144.56 --> 2150.32
or i get really pissed off that's my

2146.96 --> 2153.28
response but i i technically classify it

2150.32 --> 2154.32
under homophobia

2153.28 --> 2157.119
right

2154.32 --> 2159.839
just like arachnophobia

2157.119 --> 2162.32
it's a physical response

2159.839 --> 2162.32
mostly

2162.96 --> 2168.8
and it's real

2165.599 --> 2172.32
and it's yeah homophobic it's just a

2168.8 --> 2175.28
stupid slur now like nobody even knows

2172.32 --> 2179.04
anymore what homophobia really is

2175.28 --> 2182.2400000000002
because it's just been a stupid slur

2179.04 --> 2184.24
like nazi like who the [ __ ] even knowed

2182.24 --> 2187.4399999999996
what a nazi really is

2184.24 --> 2188.4799999999996
at this point who knows

2187.44 --> 2191.359
right

2188.48 --> 2194.079
almost nobody anybody that says anybody

2191.359 --> 2196.48
else is a nazi doesn't even know what it

2194.079 --> 2196.48
means

2197.44 --> 2202.88
who's

2199.119 --> 2205.04
actually knows what homophobia is

2202.88 --> 2207.52
that actu that uses it to accuse

2205.04 --> 2207.52
somebody

2207.68 --> 2213.2799999999997
they literally don't know what it means

2210.88 --> 2216.6400000000003
what it really is anymore because it's

2213.28 --> 2216.6400000000003
just become a slur

2217.28 --> 2224.1600000000003
as a standard accusation

2221.28 --> 2227.0400000000004
it's very convenient very easy going in

2224.16 --> 2228.3999999999996
that corrupted marxist mind control

2227.04 --> 2230.48
system

2228.4 --> 2232.2400000000002
but nobody actually knows what it even

2230.48 --> 2235.44
means

2232.24 --> 2235.4399999999996
that it's a real thing

2235.599 --> 2242.0
and it's not like oh how dare you

2238.24 --> 2244.56
homophobic no it's a phobia like are you

2242.0 --> 2247.28
gonna accuse an arachnophobic

2244.56 --> 2249.119
that how dare you be afraid of spiders

2247.28 --> 2251.44
how dare you like

2249.119 --> 2251.44
what

2251.52 --> 2256.48
are you out of your mind

2254.079 --> 2259.44
do you even understand the words you're

2256.48 --> 2261.359
using i bet you don't

2259.44 --> 2265.7200000000003
and that's a big problem

2261.359 --> 2265.72
and it's a worldwide problem

2270.72 --> 2273.7599999999998
no

2272.24 --> 2276.72
the other andrew

2273.76 --> 2279.8390000000004
homophobia is not just scared for

2276.72 --> 2281.7599999999998
somebody being gay

2279.839 --> 2282.64
i mean it could be for some it's not for

2281.76 --> 2284.5
me

2282.64 --> 2285.839
i know people that are gay

2284.5 --> 2288.48
[Music]

2285.839 --> 2292.64
i have no problem with that as long as

2288.48 --> 2297.04
they keep their gay stories

2292.64 --> 2299.2
to themselves i don't want to know about

2297.04 --> 2300.24
it

2299.2 --> 2302.7999999999997
like

2300.24 --> 2303.839
nothing i don't want to see it right i

2302.8 --> 2305.6800000000003
mean

2303.839 --> 2307.599
it might look kind of gay there's

2305.68 --> 2309.44
nothing really i'm gonna can do about

2307.599 --> 2311.119
that

2309.44 --> 2315.8
but i just

2311.119 --> 2315.8
just keep it away from me that's all

2332.72 --> 2336.72
most people i have met have been kind

2338.96 --> 2342.64
wow bad car you want to get ben

2343.04 --> 2347.32
the [ __ ] is wrong with you man

2368.53 --> 2371.619
[Music]

2407.44 --> 2412.96
what the [ __ ] is wrong how does that

2410.96 --> 2414.88
relate to

2412.96 --> 2419.0
the subject

2414.88 --> 2419.0
bad karma i don't get this

2424.079 --> 2431.44
if there's gay in cells uh

2428.88 --> 2431.44
probably

2431.76 --> 2435.1600000000003
very few

2440.079 --> 2443.8390000000004
i mean

2441.68 --> 2446.3999999999996
gay [ __ ]

2443.839 --> 2449.119
gay is a lot easier

2446.4 --> 2449.119
sexually

2450.64 --> 2455.2799999999997
it seems i don't even want to know it's

2452.8 --> 2459.2000000000003
so gross i don't want it but it is

2455.28 --> 2460.3190000000004
apparently a lot easier right in cells

2459.2 --> 2463.68
that's a

2460.319 --> 2463.68
male female thing

2464.4 --> 2468.56
it's because

2467.2 --> 2470.48
the male just

2468.56 --> 2472.7999999999997
can't get it

2470.48 --> 2475.04
from the females it's very different i

2472.8 --> 2477.92
don't think you can really turn into a

2475.04 --> 2481.359
gay incel unless you're just a really

2477.92 --> 2483.76
miserable miserable person that's so

2481.359 --> 2486.48
utterly unenjoyable that literally

2483.76 --> 2488.7200000000003
nobody wants to come near you

2486.48 --> 2488.72
right

2489.04 --> 2492.7599999999998
but yeah that's separate

2512.079 --> 2516.4
or if you're like a really annoying

2514.56 --> 2518.64
karen

2516.4 --> 2521.88
i think you can turn into an incel that

2518.64 --> 2521.8799999999997
way too

2525.599 --> 2530.4
i think that women can become incels i

2528.079 --> 2532.48
think actually the women

2530.4 --> 2534.64
are going to they're going to be more

2532.48 --> 2536.4
in-cell women

2534.64 --> 2539.52
as time progresses then there is going

2536.4 --> 2539.52
to be in cell men

2545.359 --> 2549.0789999999997
ever thought about that

2550.48 --> 2556.05
[Music]

2558.83 --> 2561.9
[Music]

2584.56 --> 2587.56
eh

2593.44 --> 2598.0
is glow buster's bob all done

2598.88 --> 2601.52
well yeah

2602.8 --> 2607.8390000000004
i think he's pretty toast

2605.52 --> 2611.04
i mean i think that i think at this

2607.839 --> 2613.44
point if you'd send bob

2611.04 --> 2616.0
to a psychiatrist

2613.44 --> 2619.2000000000003
i think it's pretty inevitable that he

2616.0 --> 2621.76
will be declared psychotic

2619.2 --> 2624.319
because i think he is actually psychotic

2621.76 --> 2624.3190000000004
at this point

2626.16 --> 2630.3999999999996
it's like not a not even temporary

2628.4 --> 2635.04
delusion like he's

2630.4 --> 2638.319
really gone down that staircase now

2635.04 --> 2640.72
he's actually crazy

2638.319 --> 2643.119
bob has passion yes

2640.72 --> 2646.1189999999997
yeah well passions for the insane you

2643.119 --> 2646.119
know

2660.64 --> 2664.72
you're talking about bob the science guy

2662.48 --> 2664.72
right

2669.52 --> 2675.52
oh wait globe busters bob

2672.0 --> 2676.56
no that bob uh

2675.52 --> 2679.119
i don't know

2676.56 --> 2680.96
how is he doing sorry no if people

2679.119 --> 2682.48
thought i was talking about bob from

2680.96 --> 2685.2
glow busters

2682.48 --> 2687.839
i did say it but i in my head it didn't

2685.2 --> 2689.7599999999998
register like that for some reason

2687.839 --> 2692.72
as i thought it was still pop science

2689.76 --> 2694.5600000000004
guy because that's recently happened

2692.72 --> 2696.72
now i haven't heard anything from bob in

2694.56 --> 2698.64
a while i think he's just keep on

2696.72 --> 2702.24
rolling out the same thing over and over

2698.64 --> 2704.48
again he's just sticking to his

2702.24 --> 2707.68
constructions

2704.48 --> 2710.319
dielectric acceleration and all the

2707.68 --> 2712.3999999999996
other stuff and ken wheeler references

2710.319 --> 2713.52
and and that's it and he's just kind of

2712.4 --> 2716.2400000000002
like

2713.52 --> 2717.92
recycling that

2716.24 --> 2720.16
as far as i know i don't really keep

2717.92 --> 2721.28
track of him too much

2720.16 --> 2722.8799999999997
so

2721.28 --> 2725.88
has anything

2722.88 --> 2725.88
happened

2733.76 --> 2739.44
no no not bob nodell

2736.48 --> 2740.72
now bob nodell's not crazy like that i

2739.44 --> 2744.079
mean

2740.72 --> 2744.7999999999997
there's issues for sure

2744.079 --> 2746.4
but

2744.8 --> 2748.319
he's not just

2746.4 --> 2750.64
straight out

2748.319 --> 2754.839
wandering off in la la land

2750.64 --> 2754.839
like bob the science guy

2765.68 --> 2768.68
so

2779.76 --> 2785.28
the ring laser gyro measured something

2781.92 --> 2786.48
yeah yeah and the mechanical gyroscope

2785.28 --> 2790.1600000000003
did not

2786.48 --> 2793.359
bad karma so explain that to me

2790.16 --> 2796.96
i can't believe you're i can't believe

2793.359 --> 2800.0
you still allow yourself to say that

2796.96 --> 2801.44
it's so stupid

2800.0 --> 2802.72
years now

2801.44 --> 2805.119
years

2802.72 --> 2806.56
and you're still saying that stupid

2805.119 --> 2808.88
thing

2806.56 --> 2811.359
the ring laser jar winter yeah yeah and

2808.88 --> 2812.079
the others didn't

2811.359 --> 2816.2
so

2812.079 --> 2816.2000000000003
no coriolis deviation

2816.48 --> 2821.92
you can't have one gyroscope

2819.52 --> 2825.359
turn because the earth spins underneath

2821.92 --> 2826.319
it and then the others don't that makes

2825.359 --> 2830.0789999999997
no

2826.319 --> 2833.04
freaking sense you're an idiot if you

2830.079 --> 2836.6400000000003
think that's an argument for the globe

2833.04 --> 2839.64
it's nothing nothing less than just an

2836.64 --> 2839.64
idiot

2845.839 --> 2850.88
yes he did yeah

2847.76 --> 2854.3190000000004
it had some deviation kind of weird

2850.88 --> 2856.1600000000003
although the deviation was not even

2854.319 --> 2859.68
like parallel

2856.16 --> 2861.44
to the presupposed rotating axis of

2859.68 --> 2863.68
earth

2861.44 --> 2866.319
right it was just perpendicular to their

2863.68 --> 2869.2799999999997
position so it's not even proof of that

2866.319 --> 2872.4
kind of spin in the first place but even

2869.28 --> 2874.8
if it were to be that

2872.4 --> 2879.359
it could only be that if the other

2874.8 --> 2881.23
gyroscopes were spinning just like that

2879.359 --> 2883.359
as well and they didn't

2881.23 --> 2886.4
[Music]

2883.359 --> 2887.2
and that's a fact that they didn't so to

2886.4 --> 2889.92
think

2887.2 --> 2892.72
that a ring laser gyroscope turning 50

2889.92 --> 2892.7200000000003
degrees an hour

2892.8 --> 2898.559
not parallel to the actual presupposed

2895.839 --> 2900.96
axis of the spinning bow earth

2898.559 --> 2903.44
and the others don't it's not proof it's

2900.96 --> 2905.92
just not proof

2903.44 --> 2909.28
you can't keep repeating that like a

2905.92 --> 2912.0
[ __ ] [ __ ] it's so dumb every time

2909.28 --> 2913.0400000000004
everybody says that it's really really

2912.0 --> 2916.559
dumb

2913.04 --> 2918.8
like that immediately just shaves all

2916.559 --> 2921.2000000000003
intellectual credit

2918.8 --> 2923.76
everything you said before that it all

2921.2 --> 2925.04
shaves it all right in the trashcan it's

2923.76 --> 2926.0
really

2925.04 --> 2929.839
[ __ ]

2926.0 --> 2929.839
dumb to say that

2941.44 --> 2946.96
like tim osmond is really

2944.0 --> 2946.96
[ __ ] dumb

2947.2 --> 2953.4399999999996
anti-flat earth [ __ ]

2950.16 --> 2954.5589999999997
only an anti-flat earth [ __ ] would

2953.44 --> 2957.839
respond

2954.559 --> 2961.92
reject evidence what the evidence that i

2957.839 --> 2964.319
just addressed in utter detail

2961.92 --> 2967.359
and unequivocally be

2964.319 --> 2968.88
unequivocally proved

2967.359 --> 2971.839
it to be

2968.88 --> 2974.319
nonsense not proof

2971.839 --> 2977.92
it wasn't proof if you think

2974.319 --> 2980.8
a ring laser gyroscope

2977.92 --> 2983.359
rotating while others gyroscopes are not

2980.8 --> 2985.3590000000004
rotating and the ring laser gyroscope

2983.359 --> 2987.839
was not rotating

2985.359 --> 2989.2
parallel to the presupposed axis of

2987.839 --> 2992.7999999999997
sphere earth

2989.2 --> 2995.359
then you're an absolute [ __ ]

2992.8 --> 2998.4
it's not proof it doesn't prove the

2995.359 --> 3001.04
earth spins because if the earth was

2998.4 --> 3002.8
spinning having a coriolis deviation

3001.04 --> 3004.24
which would result in gyroscopes

3002.8 --> 3006.0
spinning

3004.24 --> 3009.2799999999997
then you would see it with all

3006.0 --> 3010.88
gyroscopes at all time all of them not

3009.28 --> 3012.4
one

3010.88 --> 3013.839
it makes no

3012.4 --> 3016.079
sense

3013.839 --> 3018.24
you're an idiot if you think that proves

3016.079 --> 3018.2400000000002
it

3021.04 --> 3024.72
you are an anti-flat earther because you

3023.04 --> 3026.88
still said

3024.72 --> 3029.68
oh the ring laser gyroscope pros and

3026.88 --> 3035.0
spins and ignored

3029.68 --> 3035.0
the hardcore rest of the evidence

3041.92 --> 3045.119
oh hello dx

3045.28 --> 3049.48
you're in my country okay

3060.0 --> 3065.68
not clep ruckus that whatever else

3063.2 --> 3067.04
is happening out there in stars it's not

3065.68 --> 3070.7999999999997
even relevant

3067.04 --> 3072.24
it's just if you claim a gyroscope spins

3070.8 --> 3074.04
because the earth is turning underneath

3072.24 --> 3078.0789999999997
it then all

3074.04 --> 3079.44
gyroscopes should be spinning and they

3078.079 --> 3080.48
don't

3079.44 --> 3082.7200000000003
done

3080.48 --> 3084.96
over it's over

3082.72 --> 3087.52
it doesn't prove earth spins because if

3084.96 --> 3090.319
earth would be spinning with gyroscopes

3087.52 --> 3092.64
spinning as a result

3090.319 --> 3095.839
then all gyroscopes should be doing that

3092.64 --> 3099.2
and they didn't it's over

3095.839 --> 3099.2
immediately it's over

3108.72 --> 3115.7599999999998
only being really [ __ ] dumb would

3112.8 --> 3117.76
allow you to actually still use it as an

3115.76 --> 3121.5200000000004
argument for earthspin after that point

3117.76 --> 3123.8390000000004
on only being unbelievably

3121.52 --> 3125.28
[ __ ]

3123.839 --> 3130.04
would allow you

3125.28 --> 3130.0400000000004
to continue using that as an argument

3141.04 --> 3145.04
there's a bit of nuance there yeah i

3142.8 --> 3147.8390000000004
know there is a nuance there yeah ring

3145.04 --> 3150.4
laser gyroscope spins not parallel to

3147.839 --> 3153.04
axis of spinning ball earth yeah

3150.4 --> 3154.559
other gyroscopes don't spin

3153.04 --> 3157.44
at all

3154.559 --> 3160.4
no spinning ball earth done

3157.44 --> 3162.96
i know that's nuance yeah it's done the

3160.4 --> 3164.88
nuance is it's not an argument it's

3162.96 --> 3166.4
broken it doesn't make logical

3164.88 --> 3171.92
consistent sense

3166.4 --> 3171.92
and to appeal to it makes you [ __ ]

3177.92 --> 3183.28
all right listen i don't

3180.0 --> 3184.48
bro yeah i know yeah oh that's great

3183.28 --> 3188.96
yeah yeah

3184.48 --> 3190.88
like shoot that last toe off as well

3188.96 --> 3194.88
while you're shooting your entire foot

3190.88 --> 3196.88
off there tim osman yeah yeah i know

3194.88 --> 3200.96
i know it's it doesn't prove the earth

3196.88 --> 3200.96
spinning i know it doesn't tim osman

3202.079 --> 3206.96
unlike what you literally said earlier

3204.48 --> 3206.96
in chat

3211.92 --> 3215.599
just more rejecting evidence

3215.68 --> 3220.0789999999997
rejecting evidence of what

3217.839 --> 3222.16
earth spitting no

3220.079 --> 3225.119
no it doesn't

3222.16 --> 3225.1189999999997
earth isn't spinning

3225.92 --> 3231.28
have a good rest of your day yeah you do

3228.64 --> 3232.4
and remember what i said if you actually

3231.28 --> 3235.3590000000004
think

3232.4 --> 3238.319
that bob's ring laser gyroscope spinning

3235.359 --> 3243.119
for any amount proves the earth is a

3238.319 --> 3243.119
spinning ball you're a [ __ ] [ __ ]

3243.2 --> 3248.5989999999997
huh have have a good rest of your day as

3245.599 --> 3248.599
well

3262.43 --> 3265.71
[Music]

3271.81 --> 3275.0
[Music]

3278.16 --> 3283.52
the iss will be flying over your shirt

3285.44 --> 3288.2400000000002
i might look up if it's a really clear

3287.28 --> 3290.799
sky

3288.24 --> 3294.5589999999997
maybe i'll see something you know you

3290.799 --> 3297.119
know bad karma i'm so dreadfully bored

3294.559 --> 3298.7200000000003
by the utter lack of any kind of

3297.119 --> 3301.52
spectacle

3298.72 --> 3304.319
that legitimizes

3301.52 --> 3305.599
the globe model i'm so bored by the

3304.319 --> 3307.92
utter

3305.599 --> 3311.599
lack of evidence

3307.92 --> 3313.6800000000003
i'd be welcoming seeing anything

3311.599 --> 3316.4
right i might even say whoa

3313.68 --> 3318.96
that kind of looks like a space station

3316.4 --> 3321.119
not gonna say it is a space station it

3318.96 --> 3323.44
can't be second law thermodynamics

3321.119 --> 3325.28
violation and all that and there's no

3323.44 --> 3328.799
gravity

3325.28 --> 3329.599
or lack thereof in order for it to float

3328.799 --> 3331.7599999999998
or

3329.599 --> 3334.6400000000003
fall around a ball

3331.76 --> 3336.7200000000003
but at least it would be something other

3334.64 --> 3338.0789999999997
than just blabbering

3336.72 --> 3339.2
global

3338.079 --> 3341.8390000000004
rumors

3339.2 --> 3344.72
about [ __ ] that doesn't exist

3341.839 --> 3347.599
there's not even anything

3344.72 --> 3350.24
indicating it exists it's just endless

3347.599 --> 3352.079
rumors about nonsense

3350.24 --> 3354.799
right

3352.079 --> 3356.96
so maybe i will see some kind of iss

3354.799 --> 3359.44
thingy up there cool

3356.96 --> 3361.44
yay it doesn't prove it's a space

3359.44 --> 3363.44
station or that the earth is a spinning

3361.44 --> 3366.559
ball

3363.44 --> 3369.559
but maybe i'll see something

3366.559 --> 3369.559
whew

3395.28 --> 3399.0400000000004
what

3396.88 --> 3400.88
dx

3399.04 --> 3402.24
that's

3400.88 --> 3403.6800000000003
that's

3402.24 --> 3405.68
harsh

3403.68 --> 3407.44
brother didn't really care well you were

3405.68 --> 3409.9199999999996
severely depressed

3407.44 --> 3412.2400000000002
but he is concerned about you

3409.92 --> 3415.599
talking about flat earth

3412.24 --> 3415.5989999999997
what a [ __ ] bastard

3417.2 --> 3421.839
that that should have been completely

3418.96 --> 3421.839
the other way around

3423.92 --> 3427.28
your brother kind of sucks

3429.76 --> 3434.6400000000003
seems like he's just

3431.599 --> 3437.2000000000003
only trying to defend his own

3434.64 --> 3437.2
idea

3437.52 --> 3442.0
he's just protecting his own comfort

3439.599 --> 3444.88
zone then if he doesn't even give a [ __ ]

3442.0 --> 3448.799
whether you're severely depressed

3444.88 --> 3451.119
but only starts to act

3448.799 --> 3455.559
when you bring up flat earth that's

3451.119 --> 3455.559
brutal what a bastard

3460.64 --> 3464.48
hey slow mo moon buggy good to see you

3467.28 --> 3470.88
wrath

3468.72 --> 3474.4399999999996
oh that looks yummy rath i'm getting

3470.88 --> 3474.44
kind of hungry myself

3474.64 --> 3481.44
which is good i love getting hungry that

3477.119 --> 3481.44
means i stop feeling sick

3484.559 --> 3488.3190000000004
because i'm always damn sick in the

3486.079 --> 3491.319
morning i'm sick of being sick in the

3488.319 --> 3491.319
morning

3510.16 --> 3513.16
hmm

3520.4 --> 3525.92
add gummies

3522.24 --> 3525.9199999999996
that's not really healthy

3528.319 --> 3531.839
i'm just gonna have a

3532.559 --> 3538.88
all organic baked eggs

3536.079 --> 3543.2000000000003
baked in butter

3538.88 --> 3543.2000000000003
some nice organic spelt bread

3543.599 --> 3546.7200000000003
some good mayonnaise

3545.599 --> 3548.2400000000002
ah

3546.72 --> 3550.319
damn i shouldn't have described that now

3548.24 --> 3552.4799999999996
i'm even more hungry

3550.319 --> 3556.2799999999997
i still have to sit through this another

3552.48 --> 3556.28
50 minutes at least

3560.96 --> 3564.119
all right

3578.559 --> 3582.4
green gummies

3580.0 --> 3582.4
okay

3584.079 --> 3589.7200000000003
all right anyway i'm gonna take two

3585.76 --> 3589.7200000000003
minute break i'll be right back

3734.559 --> 3737.96
and i'm back

3744.72 --> 3749.5989999999997
kevlar really what is slow-mo

3747.68 --> 3754.2799999999997
slow motion

3749.599 --> 3754.28
that's short for slow motion come on

3761.119 --> 3766.079
right

3762.24 --> 3766.0789999999997
this name is a reference to the

3766.319 --> 3771.44
moon buggy footage which was slowed down

3778.079 --> 3780.96
what

3778.76 --> 3783.8390000000004
[Music]

3780.96 --> 3783.839
what are you talking about

3803.28 --> 3809.2000000000003
sold the only privately held

3806.559 --> 3812.799
copy of the american constitution what

3809.2 --> 3812.799
what does that even mean

3814.48 --> 3819.2
you mean like the original paper or

3816.799 --> 3819.2
something

3820.24 --> 3823.799
i don't get it

3847.76 --> 3853.8390000000004
one of the 500 original cups oh okay

3850.4 --> 3853.839
okay right

3855.039 --> 3858.039
cool

3878.16 --> 3886.24
turn your that's not how you spell your

3883.039 --> 3886.2400000000002
when it's yours

3886.4 --> 3893.039
it's not you are because that's what

3890.0 --> 3895.28
that stands for god

3893.039 --> 3898.7200000000003
i feel so silly i'm a dutch person

3895.28 --> 3898.7200000000003
having to explain this to

3900.079 --> 3907.079
people who actually have the language

3904.079 --> 3907.079
natively

3920.96 --> 3924.64
hmm

3922.4 --> 3927.599
oh thank you that's that fellow i'm glad

3924.64 --> 3930.799
i'm i'm making

3927.599 --> 3930.799
yeah making your day with

3934.839 --> 3939.96
that okay uh

3937.52 --> 3943.119
look hey

3939.96 --> 3945.28
emancipated autodidactic

3943.119 --> 3946.6400000000003
could you please shorten your name

3945.28 --> 3948.88
because

3946.64 --> 3950.64
it like takes up a lot of space it's

3948.88 --> 3952.2400000000002
really annoying especially if you're

3950.64 --> 3956.4
gonna

3952.24 --> 3958.319
post one word sentences constantly

3956.4 --> 3961.839
could you just get the carlos out of

3958.319 --> 3964.96
there then it'll fit

3961.839 --> 3968.0789999999997
or put spaces no it's probably not meant

3964.96 --> 3968.079
to have spaces but

3972.799 --> 3976.24
yeah i know you're carlos

3976.48 --> 3981.44
can you just shorten up the name so it

3978.16 --> 3983.7599999999998
doesn't take up so much space

3981.44 --> 3983.76
anyway

3984.16 --> 3990.24
you don't have to correct yeah i do

3986.72 --> 3990.24
metal slug cockatoo

3991.039 --> 3995.3590000000004
[ __ ] you

3992.48 --> 3995.359
excuse me

3996.4 --> 4001.799
no you you just have a sucky account

3998.799 --> 4001.799
name

4013.76 --> 4018.079
why don't you just put a space in

4015.52 --> 4021.839
between emancipated and autodidactic

4018.079 --> 4024.4
it's not a singular word anyway

4021.839 --> 4027.88
it isn't

4024.4 --> 4027.88
it's two words

4053.44 --> 4057.76
right but anyway yeah that flat fellow i

4055.28 --> 4060.079
appreciate what you said i do try to

4057.76 --> 4063.039
make everything entertaining or

4060.079 --> 4066.4
memorable or just

4063.039 --> 4066.4
desperately try to

4067.039 --> 4072.4
make a point

4069.2 --> 4072.3999999999996
about anything i can

4072.64 --> 4076.4
i'm just taking

4074.319 --> 4078.5589999999997
everything serious

4076.4 --> 4080.88
i take things serious that other people

4078.559 --> 4080.88
don't

4081.92 --> 4086.799
but only for good cause not just because

4085.039 --> 4090.44
oh this is something that nobody's

4086.799 --> 4090.44
talked about yet

4092.559 --> 4097.04
but just because i think that

4094.559 --> 4100.08
everybody's wrong and then i'm like yeah

4097.04 --> 4102.96
i'm going to be here saying for six

4100.08 --> 4105.759
years in a row you're all wrong oh you

4102.96 --> 4108.4
really think the sun is

4105.759 --> 4111.359
3 000 miles above a disk yeah yeah

4108.4 --> 4113.839
you're all wrong you're wrong you're

4111.359 --> 4115.4400000000005
wrong you're wrong you're wrong you're

4113.839 --> 4119.839
wrong you're wrong

4115.44 --> 4119.839
i'm doing it for six years yeah

4120.159 --> 4126.08
it's given me a lot of grief but

4122.799 --> 4129.88
i know i was right

4126.08 --> 4129.88
and that's why i did it

4141.839 --> 4144.92
all right

4146.0 --> 4151.44
i mean i like to be special

4148.96 --> 4152.319
i like to have special knowledge special

4151.44 --> 4154.3189999999995
things

4152.319 --> 4158.359
i'm just not gonna conjure up something

4154.319 --> 4158.359
that's completely pointless

4160.4 --> 4164.639999999999
i'd like to dig up things that's gonna

4162.319 --> 4167.04
give everybody a headache because it's

4164.64 --> 4169.52
really hard to understand it like it's

4167.04 --> 4171.839
actually hard it's like

4169.52 --> 4173.759
not hard and then somebody could really

4171.839 --> 4175.5199999999995
easily train through a standard

4173.759 --> 4177.759
discipline to understand it really

4175.52 --> 4180.400000000001
easily no it's going to be hard because

4177.759 --> 4183.359
there is no training for it

4180.4 --> 4183.3589999999995
that's what i do

4184.799 --> 4188.5199999999995
i am the training

4207.28 --> 4210.4
forget my hands on another copy of the

4209.04 --> 4213.04
constitution

4210.4 --> 4216.4
or if it's one of the 500 originals but

4213.04 --> 4221.199
man 20 million is a lot of money for a

4216.4 --> 4221.199
document that's being blatantly ignored

4223.6 --> 4226.6
right

4232.88 --> 4235.28
i mean

4235.84 --> 4239.84
how long before it's going to be

4237.36 --> 4242.48
officially scrapped

4239.84 --> 4244.32
right it's like they're just going to do

4242.48 --> 4246.48
it and you're all going to sit there how

4244.32 --> 4248.4
dare you you're not supposed to do that

4246.48 --> 4250.48
or whatever yeah yeah but they're going

4248.4 --> 4252.719
to throw it in the oven

4250.48 --> 4255.5199999999995
just going to throw it in the oven as

4252.719 --> 4257.199
you stand there oh angry

4255.52 --> 4260.2390000000005
how dare you do that you're not allowed

4257.199 --> 4261.28
to do it yeah yeah they're doing it

4260.239 --> 4263.04
they're

4261.28 --> 4266.04
doing it

4263.04 --> 4266.04
yeah

4275.04 --> 4278.32
so yeah definitely hold on to those

4276.96 --> 4280.0
things

4278.32 --> 4283.04
but you got to realize it's just a

4280.0 --> 4286.08
document right it's a document that

4283.04 --> 4289.28
encompasses a vow

4286.08 --> 4289.28
right a constitution

4290.88 --> 4297.12
the constitution does not provide rights

4295.12 --> 4298.48
you could say god provides rights but

4297.12 --> 4300.719
that's different

4298.48 --> 4303.919999999999
what it does

4300.719 --> 4307.199
is it's a contract

4303.92 --> 4309.679
it's a contract with a vow

4307.199 --> 4312.0
those rights it provides it only

4309.679 --> 4313.679
provides because there are people that

4312.0 --> 4316.56
have vowed

4313.679 --> 4316.56
to defend it

4317.04 --> 4321.199
and when you actually vow to defend it

4319.28 --> 4324.08
that means

4321.199 --> 4326.96
you're going to make sacrifices to

4324.08 --> 4326.96
enforce it

4327.679 --> 4332.96
personal sacrifices lack of dynamics

4330.96 --> 4334.64
lack of adaptation

4332.96 --> 4337.52
sacrifices

4334.64 --> 4340.4800000000005
changes in your entire life setup

4337.52 --> 4341.52
to ensure that the document stays in

4340.48 --> 4343.599999999999
place

4341.52 --> 4345.4400000000005
and that it is enforced

4343.6 --> 4347.76
because

4345.44 --> 4350.5599999999995
nobody

4347.76 --> 4352.4800000000005
else is going to enforce it powers are

4350.56 --> 4354.320000000001
not going to enforce it they're always

4352.48 --> 4356.959999999999
going to try to bypass it the only way

4354.32 --> 4359.44
it can be enforced is through people

4356.96 --> 4361.84
making a vow to defend it with their

4359.44 --> 4361.839999999999
lives

4364.88 --> 4371.4400000000005
like american patriot collective

4368.32 --> 4373.92
collective of individuals that have all

4371.44 --> 4376.96
made a vow to do that

4373.92 --> 4379.6
and to like no more [ __ ] around type

4376.96 --> 4381.84
of [ __ ] right that means

4379.6 --> 4383.6
going into a situation

4381.84 --> 4386.56
where everything is made to look doomed

4383.6 --> 4389.84
and then being ready to get shot

4386.56 --> 4392.8
for no damn reason

4389.84 --> 4395.28
to be prepared for actual

4392.8 --> 4399.84
in the field war

4395.28 --> 4399.84
and not war like a military war

4399.92 --> 4407.679
but a basically civil war scenario

4404.32 --> 4410.4
where deranged demonically possessed

4407.679 --> 4411.12
people are just going to hate and hate

4410.4 --> 4412.639999999999
and

4411.12 --> 4413.44
and

4412.64 --> 4416.2390000000005
like

4413.44 --> 4416.239
assault you

4417.36 --> 4422.48
and governments are gonna dig in and

4419.44 --> 4423.919999999999
just try to break the constitution

4422.48 --> 4427.04
and the people

4423.92 --> 4429.679
indoctrinated and enslaved are going to

4427.04 --> 4433.36
join them

4429.679 --> 4433.36
you have to stop it

4433.679 --> 4436.96
and that means

4435.679 --> 4439.92
basically

4436.96 --> 4441.76
that the constitution is the only law

4439.92 --> 4444.32
and that everything else

4441.76 --> 4447.12
is not legitimate

4444.32 --> 4448.48
like all this crap all these giant piles

4447.12 --> 4451.5199999999995
of papers

4448.48 --> 4452.839999999999
that have been produced by bureaucracies

4451.52 --> 4456.4800000000005
like that's

4452.84 --> 4458.96
junk that's for the oven

4456.48 --> 4461.759999999999
[ __ ] that [ __ ] the only thing that

4458.96 --> 4464.8
really matters is the constitution

4461.76 --> 4466.64
and yeah if you abide by it then you

4464.8 --> 4471.360000000001
will defend

4466.64 --> 4471.360000000001
those principles with your life

4471.6 --> 4476.56
and your death if necessary

4474.56 --> 4479.360000000001
and that's the real contract it's a

4476.56 --> 4482.8
contract it's not a a book

4479.36 --> 4485.36
it gives you rights no

4482.8 --> 4488.719
it's a contract and if you sign on to it

4485.36 --> 4488.719
then you create that

4493.6 --> 4499.120000000001
magna carta being yeah but everything a

4496.4 --> 4501.5199999999995
lot of things a lot of these old vows

4499.12 --> 4503.84
are getting broken

4501.52 --> 4505.360000000001
but the people don't have to break them

4503.84 --> 4509.28
they can

4505.36 --> 4509.28
voluntarily by realizing it

4509.36 --> 4514.239
redouble

4511.36 --> 4517.5199999999995
and basically say no we are holding to

4514.239 --> 4520.799999999999
this foul and everything else is crap we

4517.52 --> 4523.4400000000005
don't care for the endless nining

4520.8 --> 4526.2390000000005
bureaucracy garbage

4523.44 --> 4527.5199999999995
that's all for the ovens

4526.239 --> 4529.919999999999
doesn't matter the only thing that

4527.52 --> 4531.679
matters is the original laws the

4529.92 --> 4535.679
constitutions

4531.679 --> 4535.679
the the most important documents

4535.84 --> 4539.76
and then you gotta

4537.199 --> 4542.919999999999
sign on to that and ignore

4539.76 --> 4542.92
the rest

4558.56 --> 4562.4800000000005
didn't cover the story of the

4560.159 --> 4566.04
constitution because that's a joke right

4562.48 --> 4566.04
slow mo moon buggy

4571.52 --> 4576.56
i mean it's just some private sales

4574.0 --> 4578.4
right it's not super rare or anything i

4576.56 --> 4580.719
think

4578.4 --> 4583.28
it's not like unheard of

4580.719 --> 4585.76
that a copy one of the 500 has been sold

4583.28 --> 4588.32
i bet they're they're selling like every

4585.76 --> 4588.320000000001
now and then

4591.199 --> 4595.839999999999
well don't know that for sure but

4593.6 --> 4595.84
anyway

4603.92 --> 4610.2390000000005
the lords are all ignoring

4607.52 --> 4611.679
are ignoring all of it saying it's out

4610.239 --> 4612.879999999999
there yeah yeah

4611.679 --> 4613.76
and then

4612.88 --> 4616.32
well

4613.76 --> 4618.320000000001
they might be right if the people

4616.32 --> 4621.199
are going to agree with that

4618.32 --> 4622.4
then it's down the toilet goodbye you

4621.199 --> 4624.239
said no

4622.4 --> 4625.599999999999
you did not vow

4624.239 --> 4627.599999999999
you did not

4625.6 --> 4630.56
put down your blood

4627.6 --> 4632.96
like your ancestors and then it's gone

4630.56 --> 4635.04
what you got left now huh

4632.96 --> 4639.44
you got nothing now you're a slave now

4635.04 --> 4639.44
you deserve to die miserably

4639.84 --> 4644.32
right it's your [ __ ] choice because

4641.84 --> 4645.360000000001
you're too weak too deluded to distract

4644.32 --> 4649.5199999999995
it

4645.36 --> 4651.679
to even realize what was going on

4649.52 --> 4654.96
yeah if nobody

4651.679 --> 4657.1990000000005
puts their vow on these documents

4654.96 --> 4658.719
then they shall be destroyed and they

4657.199 --> 4660.799999999999
will not mean anything they will be

4658.719 --> 4663.04
ignored they will be officially

4660.8 --> 4665.1990000000005
discarded

4663.04 --> 4666.88
it will not mean anything and people

4665.199 --> 4668.719
will be like

4666.88 --> 4670.56
why did they do that yeah because you

4668.719 --> 4671.92
didn't do anything

4670.56 --> 4674.159000000001
that's why

4671.92 --> 4676.88
because you all let it happen

4674.159 --> 4678.48
you didn't put the deed

4676.88 --> 4680.159000000001
with the word

4678.48 --> 4681.678999999999
you didn't vow

4680.159 --> 4683.44
you didn't act

4681.679 --> 4685.84
on that vow

4683.44 --> 4687.199
and now you lose it

4685.84 --> 4690.56
that's why

4687.199 --> 4693.199
you can shove your grudging

4690.56 --> 4694.320000000001
nonsense up your ass

4693.199 --> 4696.48
because you're

4694.32 --> 4698.48
you didn't do anything you just let it

4696.48 --> 4700.718999999999
happen and just complain a bunch and be

4698.48 --> 4703.5199999999995
a pouty about you nobody gives a [ __ ]

4700.719 --> 4704.8
about your pouty attitude you didn't do

4703.52 --> 4707.84
anything

4704.8 --> 4707.84
and now you lose it

4719.12 --> 4722.4
so sick back

4721.6 --> 4726.159000000001
and

4722.4 --> 4727.839999999999
slide in your derangement become even

4726.159 --> 4731.28
dumber

4727.84 --> 4734.719
understand even less and die

4731.28 --> 4736.239
as a slave not even knowing what

4734.719 --> 4737.6
happened

4736.239 --> 4739.678999999999
yeah that's the result that's what

4737.6 --> 4742.08
you're gonna get if you don't

4739.679 --> 4745.04
actually uphold

4742.08 --> 4747.6
the old vows that your ancestors lived

4745.04 --> 4750.159
and died for

4747.6 --> 4752.88
if you think that's outdated well then

4750.159 --> 4754.239
you're outdated and you're the one

4752.88 --> 4756.8
that's gonna go

4754.239 --> 4760.08
and you're gonna go like a miserable

4756.8 --> 4763.92
polluted deluded slave

4760.08 --> 4766.88
gonna die miserable and probably painful

4763.92 --> 4769.04
without any respect from anybody

4766.88 --> 4772.04
because you're a loser and you gave up

4769.04 --> 4772.04
everything

4782.96 --> 4786.96
or

4785.04 --> 4788.32
you could say hey what do you mean

4786.96 --> 4789.679
outdated

4788.32 --> 4791.84
government

4789.679 --> 4792.64
you're outdated

4791.84 --> 4796.400000000001
yeah

4792.64 --> 4797.84
your exploration your expiration date

4796.4 --> 4800.159
has come

4797.84 --> 4803.1990000000005
government people in the government

4800.159 --> 4804.799999999999
doing it that way your expiration date

4803.199 --> 4807.759999999999
has come

4804.8 --> 4810.159000000001

4807.76 --> 4813.52
constitution magna carta

4810.159 --> 4816.32
that's not outdated you're outdated

4813.52 --> 4819.360000000001
that document still holds true it's

4816.32 --> 4821.5199999999995
still very important it's very wise it

4819.36 --> 4823.44
was a wise vision

4821.52 --> 4825.360000000001
for the ages

4823.44 --> 4828.48
your vision

4825.36 --> 4831.28
is [ __ ] egotistical

4828.48 --> 4832.638999999999
and degenerating it is of the devil it

4831.28 --> 4834.239
is of

4832.639 --> 4837.1990000000005
satan

4834.239 --> 4839.5199999999995
and your expiration date has come not

4837.199 --> 4840.96
the constitution not the magna carta

4839.52 --> 4843.6
yours

4840.96 --> 4847.4
your expiration date has come and you

4843.6 --> 4847.400000000001
will be replaced

4871.76 --> 4876.96
no lydia logs you don't understand what

4873.84 --> 4876.96
any of that even means

4877.04 --> 4880.639
the king shouldn't cover and it's not

4878.719 --> 4882.96
the case anymore it's outdated no but

4880.639 --> 4887.36
you don't understand what that even

4882.96 --> 4888.4
means lydia logs yeah it's not outdated

4887.36 --> 4891.679
it's about

4888.4 --> 4892.638999999999
power structure hierarchy

4891.679 --> 4895.4400000000005
it's

4892.639 --> 4898.56
the conditional setup

4895.44 --> 4900.638999999999
magna carta is not outdated it's very

4898.56 --> 4903.120000000001
much in place

4900.639 --> 4905.76
and it's used

4903.12 --> 4907.199
and the king or this case the queen does

4905.76 --> 4908.400000000001
govern

4907.199 --> 4909.44
he just

4908.4 --> 4912.48
doesn't

4909.44 --> 4913.839999999999
do it like in the old days

4912.48 --> 4916.08
at the front

4913.84 --> 4920.639
of the combat with the sword in hand and

4916.08 --> 4920.639
all that right that doesn't work anymore

4922.88 --> 4926.719
i'm gonna call you lydia logs

4927.84 --> 4931.84
because there's some [ __ ] coming out

4929.52 --> 4931.84
of you

4960.8 --> 4967.96
yeah well it's only four well i bet that

4963.28 --> 4967.96
those four are extremely important

4982.0 --> 4985.0
so

5013.36 --> 5018.0
all right

5015.84 --> 5019.04
that sounds really good rocketman

5018.0 --> 5020.56
doesn't it

5019.04 --> 5024.159
isn't that just

5020.56 --> 5025.92
very very important

5024.159 --> 5027.44
only four

5025.92 --> 5031.639
of the clauses

5027.44 --> 5031.638999999999
it sounds like really important

5057.6 --> 5062.88
remember when adults use the stat for

5059.679 --> 5062.88
something now we have trolls

5067.52 --> 5072.4800000000005
unfortunately

5068.84 --> 5074.159000000001
that's that's happening

5072.48 --> 5077.32
hey you guys have never run rmp good to

5074.159 --> 5077.32
see you

5096.8 --> 5101.360000000001
did you change your name to just carlos

5098.88 --> 5103.92
just carlos thank you

5101.36 --> 5107.04
thank you for doing that

5103.92 --> 5107.04
i appreciate that

5107.44 --> 5113.4
because it's a lot more

5109.76 --> 5113.400000000001
readable now

5120.239 --> 5123.239
huh

5150.239 --> 5157.12
what's the netherlands constitution like

5152.32 --> 5158.48
have i read it no i do not i have

5157.12 --> 5159.92
heard

5158.48 --> 5162.159
about it though

5159.92 --> 5165.12
like no well i know

5162.159 --> 5166.879999999999
enough for now

5165.12 --> 5169.84
and there's still plenty of people that

5166.88 --> 5169.84
do know

5186.8 --> 5194.12
but yeah the look the us constitution

5189.6 --> 5194.120000000001
has always kind of fascinated me

5196.719 --> 5201.639
i don't know just been exposed to it

5198.639 --> 5201.639
more

5224.4 --> 5226.719
hmm

5228.719 --> 5232.719
okay well thanks rocketman for sharing

5231.12 --> 5237.0
all that

5232.719 --> 5237.0
sounds like a pretty awesome document

5238.239 --> 5242.879999999999
not outdated at all

5240.88 --> 5246.96
and i think it's even good to have like

5242.88 --> 5249.6
the not applied parts of the document

5246.96 --> 5252.96
for historical reference right

5249.6 --> 5256.56
to catalog what has happened

5252.96 --> 5256.56
how did it come into being

5257.199 --> 5262.0
right it's all important to know how it

5259.44 --> 5262.0
developed

5262.88 --> 5270.639
because if we lose track of history and

5266.56 --> 5273.1990000000005
how law developed we just throw it aside

5270.639 --> 5276.56
then demonic tyrants

5273.199 --> 5279.879999999999
will rewrite the entire foundations of

5276.56 --> 5279.88
your mind

5280.56 --> 5287.6
so you will not be able to

5284.48 --> 5289.678999999999
attain programming to even understand

5287.6 --> 5291.92
how government and law making works

5289.679 --> 5295.04
anymore that's what will happen

5291.92 --> 5297.76
when you shove these outdated documents

5295.04 --> 5297.76
in the trash

5298.239 --> 5301.28
that's why you need them

5301.44 --> 5305.839999999999
even the parts that aren't utilized

5303.36 --> 5308.159
anymore for historical reference you

5305.84 --> 5310.639
need to know what happened how did it

5308.159 --> 5313.599999999999
come into being why

5310.639 --> 5316.159000000001
what was the situation and then what's

5313.6 --> 5317.92
the situation now compared how did it

5316.159 --> 5320.879999999999
get to this point

5317.92 --> 5322.719
these are all important things

5320.88 --> 5325.28
to have

5322.719 --> 5329.36
because if you lose them

5325.28 --> 5331.84
then demonic tyrants will take control

5329.36 --> 5334.08
mind control program everybody with an

5331.84 --> 5337.04
alternative history

5334.08 --> 5339.199
right to a level that would make like

5337.04 --> 5342.8
kim jong-un

5339.199 --> 5344.719
look like a pretty decent common dude

5342.8 --> 5349.04
right because

5344.719 --> 5350.4800000000005
demonic tyrants don't have any limits

5349.04 --> 5352.56
they they don't

5350.48 --> 5354.32
know how to stop

5352.56 --> 5357.6
being worse

5354.32 --> 5360.239
they'll go any length they'll make a

5357.6 --> 5361.76
torturous mockery out of the minds of

5360.239 --> 5366.159
man

5361.76 --> 5366.159000000001
just for their [ __ ] amusement

5368.0 --> 5373.84
yeah and that's why

5370.32 --> 5376.0
you don't discard these old documents

5373.84 --> 5378.56
because they're supposedly outdated oh

5376.0 --> 5382.8
we could do it all better no no you need

5378.56 --> 5382.8
them just for the history alone

5386.239 --> 5393.839999999999
don't let them scrub it out

5389.44 --> 5393.839999999999
don't let them make you forget

5404.159 --> 5407.599999999999
that rock i'm just referring to

5405.76 --> 5409.6
something that was said earlier about it

5407.6 --> 5411.84
i don't even know who was saying that

5409.6 --> 5415.04
it's like 15 minutes ago

5411.84 --> 5419.28
but i'm talking in general in general

5415.04 --> 5423.36
not specific in general not specific in

5419.28 --> 5423.36
general not specific

5429.6 --> 5432.6
like

5448.8 --> 5453.52
right we don't lose if we don't use our

5451.6 --> 5455.4400000000005
rights we then we lose it well

5453.52 --> 5457.52
use it

5455.44 --> 5460.799999999999
right

5457.52 --> 5463.4400000000005
but also defend it realize that if you

5460.8 --> 5464.88
claim a right you need to defend the

5463.44 --> 5468.08
right right that's

5464.88 --> 5469.92
that's almost the core point

5468.08 --> 5474.239
if you claim right then you have to

5469.92 --> 5474.2390000000005
defend it or somebody will just take it

5474.48 --> 5479.919999999999
jesus dude what's up with these [ __ ]

5477.6 --> 5482.56
spam troll [ __ ]

5479.92 --> 5482.56
[ __ ] off

5483.199 --> 5489.599999999999
you're not gonna get seen don't you get

5485.199 --> 5492.32
it you stupid spambot nobody sees this

5489.6 --> 5495.4400000000005
ever nobody's gonna see this nobody in

5492.32 --> 5498.4
this chat is even gonna consider

5495.44 --> 5501.599999999999
or remember what you said

5498.4 --> 5501.599999999999
it's complete waste

5503.6 --> 5507.4400000000005
nobody's gonna see it

5505.76 --> 5509.1990000000005
watching the show afterward nobody's

5507.44 --> 5511.599999999999
gonna see it pop up

5509.199 --> 5512.879999999999
in the chat on screen it's a complete

5511.6 --> 5514.0
waste

5512.88 --> 5515.92
stop

5514.0 --> 5518.96
the stupid

5515.92 --> 5522.08
ad spam

5518.96 --> 5525.28
nobody's gonna see it here nobody not a

5522.08 --> 5527.679
person is ever going to seek that out

5525.28 --> 5527.679
ever

5531.199 --> 5535.04
yeah i know they're attacking everybody

5533.92 --> 5535.84
everything

5535.04 --> 5538.32
but

5535.84 --> 5540.4800000000005
i'm just trying to communicate i don't

5538.32 --> 5544.0
know if there's anything listening that

5540.48 --> 5547.638999999999
they will absolutely not find any clicks

5544.0 --> 5547.639
here ever

5548.08 --> 5551.36
not a single soul

5556.0 --> 5559.84
people should care more about our rights

5557.92 --> 5562.0
because they are not given by government

5559.84 --> 5564.2390000000005
they are given by god

5562.0 --> 5564.239
no

5568.32 --> 5571.92
i don't see it like that

5570.4 --> 5575.12
no they're not given by government but

5571.92 --> 5578.639
they're not rights aren't given by god

5575.12 --> 5578.639
rights are to be claimed

5579.84 --> 5584.8
if you're gonna

5582.159 --> 5586.719
sign up for a document of

5584.8 --> 5590.159000000001
rights declaration

5586.719 --> 5591.92
then you make a vow you basically sign a

5590.159 --> 5593.92
spiritual contract

5591.92 --> 5596.32
like i stand behind this

5593.92 --> 5599.84
and that means you will fight and

5596.32 --> 5599.84
potentially die for it

5599.92 --> 5605.6
that's the right that god gives you the

5602.0 --> 5608.32
right the right to choose to choose

5605.6 --> 5610.0
to abide by that contract a spiritual

5608.32 --> 5611.759999999999
contract

5610.0 --> 5613.84
but with that becomes responsibility

5611.76 --> 5616.08
because you can just say it you can be

5613.84 --> 5617.92
allowed oh it's so good it's so good but

5616.08 --> 5619.28
then when push comes to shove you don't

5617.92 --> 5622.8
do anything

5619.28 --> 5625.199
well then you don't have that right

5622.8 --> 5626.56
it was just all bluster it's just very

5625.199 --> 5628.4
convenient

5626.56 --> 5629.6
right

5628.4 --> 5632.799999999999
you don't

5629.6 --> 5634.0
get a right you have to fight

5632.8 --> 5635.6
always

5634.0 --> 5638.48
always

5635.6 --> 5641.120000000001
small skill large skills always

5638.48 --> 5645.12
there is no right you get for free

5641.12 --> 5647.199
rights don't come for free ever

5645.12 --> 5648.88
ever you understand

5647.199 --> 5651.04
it's unnatural

5648.88 --> 5653.679
to think that rights come for free is

5651.04 --> 5653.679
unnatural

5654.56 --> 5660.56
only rights that come for

5656.84 --> 5663.76
free is what yeah

5660.56 --> 5663.76
is what a baby gets

5664.48 --> 5669.919999999999
only babies have rights for free

5667.6 --> 5672.56
because they can't enforce it

5669.92 --> 5674.639
and everybody wants

5672.56 --> 5676.080000000001
well everybody that's not a demonic

5674.639 --> 5678.4800000000005
freak

5676.08 --> 5680.48
wants to help them

5678.48 --> 5682.879999999999
right

5680.48 --> 5684.959999999999
but when you're actually an adult

5682.88 --> 5687.28
or old enough to understand

5684.96 --> 5688.719
then you should know that rights never

5687.28 --> 5691.04
come for free

5688.719 --> 5691.04
ever

5691.36 --> 5696.08
nothing comes for free and especially

5693.76 --> 5696.08
rights

5697.119 --> 5701.679
you can't buy them although you might be

5699.679 --> 5703.84
able to but then it's not really a right

5701.679 --> 5706.4800000000005
it's more like a privilege

5703.84 --> 5708.4800000000005
but a true right always comes with a

5706.48 --> 5710.0
fight

5708.48 --> 5713.4
you gotta fight

5710.0 --> 5713.4
for your rights

5714.159 --> 5718.96
whether it's the party

5716.159 --> 5721.5199999999995
or to just live a logo's life

5718.96 --> 5723.679
you gotta fight for him or you lose it

5721.52 --> 5725.4400000000005
because yeah

5723.679 --> 5726.96
what's a right if it can just be taken

5725.44 --> 5729.199
away just like that

5726.96 --> 5730.96
it's nothing

5729.199 --> 5733.96
it doesn't exist it was just an idea

5730.96 --> 5733.96
then

5754.19 --> 5757.29
[Music]

5760.239 --> 5764.4
trolls hate freedom only group think

5762.96 --> 5766.4800000000005
yeah

5764.4 --> 5768.799999999999
some trolls

5766.48 --> 5770.5599999999995
there's actually freedom trolls as well

5768.8 --> 5774.8
it's just

5770.56 --> 5778.2390000000005
a free person with terrible impulses

5774.8 --> 5781.1990000000005
not all trolls are just like communist

5778.239 --> 5782.959999999999
marxist muppets not all of them

5781.199 --> 5786.0
thank god

5782.96 --> 5788.32
sometimes a troll is just a person in a

5786.0 --> 5790.719
really nasty mood and they can't help

5788.32 --> 5790.719
himself

5793.36 --> 5799.36
so no i think that there's plenty of

5795.44 --> 5801.678999999999
trolls that actually really like freedom

5799.36 --> 5805.119
and they realize that they can't troll

5801.679 --> 5807.679
because of the freedom

5805.119 --> 5810.799999999999
and they're just like yeah

5807.679 --> 5814.4800000000005
you can't control us

5810.8 --> 5814.4800000000005
that's why they're trolls right

5814.8 --> 5817.6
so

5816.08 --> 5821.44
no i don't think that all trolls are

5817.6 --> 5821.4400000000005
collectivists but there are some

5823.6 --> 5828.88
i guess it depends on what comes shoving

5826.96 --> 5831.679
in right

5828.88 --> 5831.679
through the chat

5833.92 --> 5837.88
whoever is on your case

5842.8 --> 5847.76
right but i'm gonna round out the show

5844.48 --> 5850.0
now because i'm really hungry

5847.76 --> 5854.88
uh didn't really get to the spiritual

5850.0 --> 5857.199
credit score title today

5854.88 --> 5859.679
although yeah maybe

5857.199 --> 5862.5599999999995
maybe spiritual credit score does apply

5859.679 --> 5863.36
to well constitution

5862.56 --> 5864.56
and

5863.36 --> 5867.119
the vow

5864.56 --> 5870.0
you really have to make to defend it or

5867.119 --> 5872.88
it wouldn't doesn't mean anything

5870.0 --> 5875.04
maybe it applies to that partially

5872.88 --> 5877.04
there's more more that yeah to talk

5875.04 --> 5879.44
about

5877.04 --> 5881.28
hope to get to it again

5879.44 --> 5883.44
i'll bring up the subject again

5881.28 --> 5885.44
spiritual credit score because it is it

5883.44 --> 5888.5599999999995
is a concept

5885.44 --> 5890.799999999999
barely broke open that jar but

5888.56 --> 5893.52
it's something that's

5890.8 --> 5894.400000000001
considered worthy

5893.52 --> 5896.400000000001
