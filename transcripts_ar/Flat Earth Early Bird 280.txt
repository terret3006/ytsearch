127.829 --> 134.489
I got something different

130.86 --> 137.94000000000003
I got a peach it was a dammit air

134.489 --> 140.01
quality peach and I thought yeah let's

137.94 --> 144.35999999999999
just take it it's been a long time since

140.01 --> 146.13
I had one of those smells lovely so I'm

144.36 --> 149.39000000000001
gonna take a bite of that out of that

146.13 --> 152.57
somewhere in the during the show and

149.39 --> 152.57
your bed

154.62 --> 163.739
so let's see who is in chat the AGM was

159.76 --> 172.48
first no wait was he yeah he was and

163.739 --> 178.109
Steve stone monkey 3d delete delete over

172.48 --> 182.13899999999998
moco Brenda random Karen be to see you

178.109 --> 187.81
page righteous force Amanda young was

182.139 --> 195.459
here Trish Blythe yeah good to see you

187.81 --> 201.129
all I hope did you see did you guys see

195.459 --> 203.98000000000002
the debate yesterday it was kind of like

201.129 --> 209.319
it felt like it was Persky mouse last

203.98 --> 210.76
run because yeah we really all started

209.319 --> 213.36999999999998
to complain and eventually even

210.76 --> 216.909
basically asked him to just leave and he

213.37 --> 221.829
refused to leave it he just he was

216.909 --> 224.10899999999998
trolling us he was very annoying and as

221.829 --> 229.989
a consequence he's been removed from the

224.109 --> 231.549
master beat yet and yeah I don't know

229.989 --> 233.47
what he's going to be doing now but

231.549 --> 235.18
probably just gonna be hanging out more

233.47 --> 236.97899999999998
at Jose's that I wonder if he's just

235.18 --> 240.04000000000002
gonna keep up this nonsense because he

236.979 --> 244.81
was completely broken and he knew it I

240.04 --> 246.819
could feel like the pain from the

244.81 --> 250.349
realization of it I could it was

246.819 --> 253.20899999999997
palpable and then he just tried to

250.349 --> 256.0
deepen the escapism further and just

253.209 --> 259.15
keep on red herring he refused to give

256.0 --> 262.93
it up and it's it's delusional it's

259.15 --> 264.909
literally a form of delusion and I don't

262.93 --> 268.99
understand exactly why he's doing it

264.909 --> 272.53
maybe because he really needs this

268.99 --> 275.229
fantastical project because he's not

272.53 --> 278.32
feeling at all that great and he's using

275.229 --> 281.229
it as an as an escapist maneuver for his

278.32 --> 284.44
own feelings I don't know it's yeah

281.229 --> 285.13
interpreting somebody else's motives and

284.44 --> 290.83
all that

285.13 --> 290.83
but that's how it feels to like me and I

292.24 --> 299.96000000000004
don't know but at least it's a good sign

296.72 --> 303.32000000000005
that maybe the Bates are now the debates

299.96 --> 307.25
are now gonna move on oh my god there's

303.32 --> 310.58
these flies here and I don't know why

307.25 --> 314.419
they got an entire room but they persist

310.58 --> 321.38
on trying to get in my face the most

314.419 --> 324.49
annoying flies ever like I usually very

321.38 --> 330.83
friendly and don't hurt a fly but these

324.49 --> 332.90000000000003
my god that's usually just one act to

330.83 --> 342.37
what they keep on slipping back in and

332.9 --> 342.37
just see what I mean super annoying

345.81 --> 353.199
it's like maybe it's Epstein's

350.65 --> 355.87
incarnation bothering the hell out of me

353.199 --> 361.24
and everyone else yeah I don't think

355.87 --> 369.729
he's dead and it's kind of funny that my

361.24 --> 372.34000000000003
first interpretation is that my original

369.729 --> 375.00899999999996
interpretation of the whole situation

372.34 --> 377.83
and it's now just thrown out there

375.009 --> 381.47900000000004
everybody's conspiracy sizing about it I

377.83 --> 387.06899999999996
told everyone this is like the new 9/11

381.479 --> 389.919
maybe not be as bombastic in a way it's

387.069 --> 392.83000000000004
not things exploding and [ __ ] but it is

389.919 --> 394.659
basically so complex what's going on

392.83 --> 398.979
such a multi-layered the event that

394.659 --> 401.71
happened with an obvious lie and some

398.979 --> 404.44
really weird hidden things and that's

401.71 --> 406.44899999999996
just like the perfect brewing pot for a

404.44 --> 408.58
giant conspiracy that's never gonna end

406.449 --> 412.33000000000004
although it will at some point end

408.58 --> 414.69899999999996
because I predict and I don't know

412.33 --> 415.5
exactly when but I think in a couple of

414.699 --> 420.009
years

415.5 --> 423.969
not this year probably not the real

420.009 --> 427.47900000000004
Epstein's gotta be found yeah you heard

423.969 --> 431.44
me because I'm pretty sure that this guy

427.479 --> 433.27
and researchers afterward kind of

431.44 --> 436.09
confirmed this it was not the same guy

433.27 --> 439.659
he had a different type of ear so they

436.09 --> 441.849
they just drug in a lookalike corpse or

439.659 --> 443.65
something or a clone or however you want

441.849 --> 447.52
to see that who knows how that works

443.65 --> 450.34
it's probably a double that they knew

447.52 --> 453.88
for a long time and they that's just

450.34 --> 455.67999999999995
like yeah it's a double for exactly this

453.88 --> 458.5
kind of issue then they unexpectedly

455.68 --> 465.53000000000003
just kidnap him drag him out and just

458.5 --> 470.45
use him as a fake dead person I think

465.53 --> 471.73999999999995
it's kind of almost similar to while a

470.45 --> 474.5
lot of flat-earthers

471.74 --> 477.65000000000003
including myself have suspicions about

474.5 --> 479.42
Steven Hawkins not actually being

477.65 --> 483.14
another person because there's different

479.42 --> 484.40000000000003
jaw and it's just different guy but they

483.14 --> 489.05
just switched him with somebody that

484.4 --> 491.0
kind of looks like it so they can do

489.05 --> 493.73
this kind of thing and I think they did

491.0 --> 499.22
it with Epstein as well so he's just

493.73 --> 504.26
been pull out to somewhere now why did

499.22 --> 507.26000000000005
that and who exactly did it that is a

504.26 --> 509.89
very complex question because is it like

507.26 --> 516.4689999999999
a lot of people who know it's Mossad or

509.89 --> 519.68
is it like a secret team from Trump like

516.469 --> 522.83
it could be compartments of the deep

519.68 --> 524.51
state which are not unified let me tell

522.83 --> 528.5300000000001
you that there are different parties in

524.51 --> 531.77
it or it is like a Mossad outside agency

528.53 --> 533.9
that has in sort of alliance with it's

531.77 --> 539.24
complex as hell so you don't really know

533.9 --> 542.24
where he ended up and why exactly but I

539.24 --> 544.13
have this well it is vision related and

542.24 --> 546.8
it's what now that this all happened I

544.13 --> 549.95
kind of feel like I can just say it and

546.8 --> 552.53
that is yeah it's now being Peretti's

549.95 --> 556.25
dead all ba bla bla bla bla and years

552.53 --> 559.1899999999999
later he's just gonna be found and then

556.25 --> 560.87
gonna be tried after all but it's

559.19 --> 563.87
probably gonna take some time before

560.87 --> 566.8
they even find him and I don't know if

563.87 --> 571.18
they're then supposed to find him like a

566.8 --> 574.8499999999999
timed late revelation kind of thing or

571.18 --> 575.6899999999999
that he just by chance by gods chance

574.85 --> 578.96
may be found

575.69 --> 581.1700000000001
I don't know how that'll work but that

578.96 --> 586.61
is my prediction

581.17 --> 589.54
so let that be official and yeah it's

586.61 --> 589.54
just a matter of time now

590.699 --> 598.41
right or the Vatican look at this

593.799 --> 601.86
look the Vatican is has his there there

598.41 --> 608.199
their little fingers in all the secret

601.86 --> 610.749
societies and [ __ ] and yeah and so the

608.199 --> 613.179
Mossad has that too in in a lot of ways

610.749 --> 615.8190000000001
so they're all just the secret service

613.179 --> 619.269
groups that are all just working along

615.819 --> 622.1189999999999
one another not necessarily as friends

619.269 --> 625.079
but yeah that's the checkerboard

622.119 --> 627.61
remember it's the checkerboard system

625.079 --> 630.16
there in the field as enemies

627.61 --> 632.679
potentially but when it comes down to

630.16 --> 651.509
business when they get close of [ __ ]

632.679 --> 655.679
hold on it's never gonna get dry so yeah

651.509 --> 655.679
see so that does happen

665.449 --> 671.49
but anyway yeah as they approach the

668.939 --> 675.8689999999999
staircase as they are we're working on

671.49 --> 680.49
the big altar the spell - and chants the

675.869 --> 685.9490000000001
wider public they do work together they

680.49 --> 688.11
leave the checkerboard so yeah

685.949 --> 693.3599999999999
to kind of tie in that little thing that

688.11 --> 697.1
I talked about so yeah it is it is kind

693.36 --> 701.029
of fascinating interesting to see and

697.1 --> 705.2090000000001
yeah just keep your eyes open and really

701.029 --> 708.269
don't jump too easy conclusions

705.209 --> 710.0089999999999
especially like very basic conclusions

708.269 --> 710.389
that seem to be handed out just like

710.009 --> 712.889
that

710.389 --> 715.319
because there may just be more to it and

712.889 --> 718.019
all that on the other hand everybody

715.319 --> 721.86
pretty much realizes this it's weird

718.019 --> 725.519
it's like it's a conspiracy there's

721.86 --> 728.97
multi narrative approaches but at the

725.519 --> 731.369
same time everybody's so conscious of it

728.97 --> 734.0690000000001
and they can't nobody can help but just

731.369 --> 738.8290000000001
mention that how complex this may really

734.069 --> 741.8389999999999
turn out to be and that is kind of new

738.829 --> 748.019
during 9/11 that didn't happen right

741.839 --> 750.869
away it took very long and everything

748.019 --> 752.819
was much more adamant much more the

750.869 --> 755.339
suspense of disbelief was much more

752.819 --> 758.5999999999999
powerful about it for a for a long time

755.339 --> 761.999
this thing despite being just

758.6 --> 766.86
potentially as heavy and complex as the

761.999 --> 768.6890000000001
9/11 conspiracy is in an age where

766.86 --> 770.61
everybody's much more conscious of these

768.689 --> 772.4989999999999
things and pay more attention and

770.61 --> 776.189
understand much more about secret

772.499 --> 781.9390000000001
societies and secret plans so it's gonna

776.189 --> 781.939
be quicker altogether

783.07 --> 791.47
uh-huh very funny

785.95 --> 796.75
now I was actually on a in the train

791.47 --> 799.7
towards a study that I was doing I

796.75 --> 801.709
dropped out that year because I was just

799.7 --> 803.33
completely I wasn't really that

801.709 --> 806.0
motivated for it anyway it didn't really

803.33 --> 808.779
work out but I still remember 9/11 I was

806.0 --> 816.29
on the train going there hearing it and

808.779 --> 818.5889999999999
just being like what I was pretty

816.29 --> 818.5889999999999
shocked

819.839 --> 825.7600000000001
especially shocked by how people respond

823.3 --> 833.8499999999999
to it like everybody was like really

825.76 --> 833.85
getting dramatic over it and eventually

834.06 --> 845.0189999999999
yeah I got caught up in that as well I

837.75 --> 847.5
was very emotional eBay table it was

845.019 --> 852.94
also the first time that even the

847.5 --> 856.24
concept of like Moslems on a wider scale

852.94 --> 858.69
came even in into my view before that

856.24 --> 862.12
time I knew about Moslems I've even

858.69 --> 865.62
confronted and family with that with

862.12 --> 869.17
some weird issues but it's never really

865.62 --> 871.87
caught up my attention in the grand

869.17 --> 874.6899999999999
scheme of things and that 9/11 happened

871.87 --> 877.69
and then also well the propaganda

874.69 --> 880.089
narratives in that direction which is in

877.69 --> 883.24
one hand necessarily on the hat of their

880.089 --> 884.8290000000001
hand it is kind of politicized that

883.24 --> 888.699
really did bring it forward in my

884.829 --> 891.069
attention and now after such a long time

888.699 --> 896.17
and it's still going and these things

891.069 --> 901.51
are happening like the example now

896.17 --> 903.61
between Pakistan and India it's so

901.51 --> 905.38
interesting to see that all the the

903.61 --> 910.38
people that originally brought up the

905.38 --> 913.75
narratives during 9/11 as a conspiracy

910.38 --> 917.019
narrative and all that the day is now

913.75 --> 920.8
all really kind of a lot of them moved

917.019 --> 925.029
on to just political priorities and it's

920.8 --> 927.25
not even like a standard book like for

925.029 --> 928.87
example the liberal politics tent that

927.25 --> 930.399
they had just have this standard book

928.87 --> 932.199
and you just have to stick to the book

930.399 --> 937.839
and nobody really cares whatever else

932.199 --> 940.449
you seem to be doing but for the other

937.839 --> 943.7790000000001
side that's not really the case and

940.449 --> 946.81
every individual can at some point

943.779 --> 949.449
attain a certain kind of narrative

946.81 --> 951.8599999999999
choice which is very likely to somehow

949.449 --> 956.51
be in tied into

951.86 --> 962.99
a personal religious conviction or even

956.51 --> 967.7
a a plan for profit like like attack

962.99 --> 970.82
this group keep things rolling

967.7 --> 974.269
and then basically bet against them by

970.82 --> 976.1600000000001
going out against them it's complex how

974.269 --> 983.079
that works but it's basically is form of

976.16 --> 992.51
economics anyway getting to complex now

983.079 --> 996.8599999999999
hmm oh yeah I heard that from Princess

992.51 --> 998.5699999999999
Diana I was really shocked I was you

996.86 --> 1001.24
know all the conspiracies about her but

998.57 --> 1005.35
I've always been extremely charmed by

1001.24 --> 1010.3
her just by her appearance just and it's

1005.35 --> 1013.4200000000001
not like the look it's just what then

1010.3 --> 1016.27
she had a spirit a very unique spirit

1013.42 --> 1019.56
and I have the senses for that so it

1016.27 --> 1024.55
stood out to me and other people like me

1019.56 --> 1029.4389999999999
and that was very shocking that was like

1024.55 --> 1033.49
it felt like a real loss cuz she could

1029.439 --> 1037.949
have potentially done so much good and

1033.49 --> 1037.949
that's probably why they took her out

1040.11 --> 1045.4089999999999
because she refused to be a pawn puppet

1045.829 --> 1058.07
her spirit didn't allow it right Karen B

1066.06 --> 1076.09
so yeah anything you guys want to talk

1070.93 --> 1078.88
about pretty much laid out what if yeah

1076.09 --> 1081.22
yesterday it was just mostly the the

1078.88 --> 1083.92
whole spur schema debate and yeah how

1081.22 --> 1088.41
many times can you go through that it is

1083.92 --> 1090.76
just a back-and-forth tug-of-war in

1088.41 --> 1093.64
psychology psychological warfare

1090.76 --> 1096.58
basically because it's just you couldn't

1093.64 --> 1099.1200000000001
even get a conversation going it's just

1096.58 --> 1106.54
non-stop red herring and deflections and

1099.12 --> 1110.9399999999998
poking at one another and yeah alright

1106.54 --> 1114.58
yeah I did look into the Kola borehole

1110.94 --> 1117.5800000000002
didn't know anything special stood out

1114.58 --> 1120.55
to me it's just the that supposed

1117.58 --> 1123.03
deepest hole they ever dug what about it

1120.55 --> 1123.03
Trish Blythe

1128.54 --> 1132.7
oh really he did Oh God

1135.59 --> 1143.289
yeah I seem to be very very popular

1140.659 --> 1143.2890000000002
these days

1150.45 --> 1159.049
so any idea what it's about is it just

1153.749 --> 1161.97
about how I'm such a goody two-shoes

1159.049 --> 1166.559
gatekeeper helper to Nathan is it like

1161.97 --> 1176.19
that or or is there anything real about

1166.559 --> 1177.9289999999999
it all right Trish live well they

1176.19 --> 1179.249
couldn't go deeper because it was

1177.929 --> 1182.249
getting dangerous right

1179.249 --> 1185.19
that was hydrogen mud bubbling up and

1182.249 --> 1193.44
yeah that's potentially very dangerous

1185.19 --> 1198.409
or or is it something else to be fair I

1193.44 --> 1198.409
didn't read through the whole thing so

1210.54 --> 1225.01
what's dude and what is Roth well how

1217.63 --> 1228.7
does David wise ever done serious okay

1225.01 --> 1231.54
he may be a bit of a disco but he's

1228.7 --> 1231.54
really a nice guy

1236.78 --> 1241.8999999999999
[Music]

1249.43 --> 1254.89
hmm yeah yeah I heard that I heard that

1253.12 --> 1263.8899999999999
as well at a meeting that's pretty yeah

1254.89 --> 1266.74
it was pretty incredible but it it's

1263.89 --> 1270.7900000000002
weird how you would approach it because

1266.74 --> 1274.59
yes that could have been possible but it

1270.79 --> 1280.8999999999999
I think that she was literally trying to

1274.59 --> 1285.58
how do you say gentrify I guess the

1280.9 --> 1289.14
Muslim world and really get it more

1285.58 --> 1291.6999999999998
compatible with Western world and

1289.14 --> 1295.3200000000002
westernized I think that she was very

1291.7 --> 1302.68
much behind that and that may have been

1295.32 --> 1305.28
driving her decision-making also that's

1302.68 --> 1305.28
what I heard

1313.33 --> 1320.9499999999998
anyway it's ancient news now

1330.69 --> 1341.6100000000001
Omega meal what really is he if he's

1339.429 --> 1345.039
really an Omega then why does he always

1341.61 --> 1348.789
fall back to total Sivan yay gamma

1345.039 --> 1350.259
behavior because he does that that's I

1348.789 --> 1353.9089999999999
don't think that something in Omega

1350.259 --> 1353.909
really does trash Blythe

1373.74 --> 1388.44
oh [ __ ] really oh I didn't know

1377.49 --> 1392.94
Omega is worse than gamma damn I don't

1388.44 --> 1398.73
know look I think the guy has a serious

1392.94 --> 1402.919
impulse problem and it's like how do you

1398.73 --> 1406.799
say like almost physical deform level

1402.919 --> 1409.23
but he does he is he isn't stupid and

1406.799 --> 1413.039
that's the frustrating thing about it if

1409.23 --> 1415.02
he was just a [ __ ] then everybody

1413.039 --> 1419.34
could ignore him just very easily but he

1415.02 --> 1421.77
is kind of smart he just doesn't have

1419.34 --> 1426.12
any control over himself so I don't know

1421.77 --> 1430.4089999999999
if he is this Omega you claim I think

1426.12 --> 1432.33
that if he somehow managed with giant

1430.409 --> 1434.3700000000001
effort though it's not gonna be easy but

1432.33 --> 1437.73
he if he somehow managed to just

1434.37 --> 1440.1899999999998
completely contain that that

1437.73 --> 1443.73
out-of-control demon he just has in

1440.19 --> 1446.429
himself tames it doesn't give it the

1443.73 --> 1451.32
reins then he may become a valuable

1446.429 --> 1453.6000000000001
asset but maybe that's just me being way

1451.32 --> 1456.24
too optimistic again because usually

1453.6 --> 1459.6589999999999
people that have Savannah syndrome will

1456.24 --> 1462.36
never get rid of it it's not like they

1459.659 --> 1464.94
really contract it it's just they always

1462.36 --> 1468.4799999999998
had it and then it shows itself and then

1464.94 --> 1470.49
they get addicted to showing it and they

1468.48 --> 1478.5
refuse to conceal it again that's

1470.49 --> 1480.89
usually the problem so just like with

1478.5 --> 1480.89
Randy

1481.1 --> 1499.58
hmm oh god yes hey a video really page

1496.14 --> 1503.1000000000001
why why why don't you think I should

1499.58 --> 1510.96
admire or follow somebody like Owen

1503.1 --> 1516.6299999999999
Benjamin you tell me super looming a

1510.96 --> 1519.6000000000001
yena oh so he's not good enough for you

1516.63 --> 1523.44
now what's your problem with him why

1519.6 --> 1528.06
don't you just tell me oh really

1523.44 --> 1531.42
East which which friends are those you

1528.06 --> 1534.3799999999999
tell me you're gonna have to be a little

1531.42 --> 1534.38
bit more specific

1540.75 --> 1554.59
he's an end ah sorry that's yeah that

1548.11 --> 1557.4699999999998
just cost you a wrench this is the

1554.59 --> 1559.87
second time yeah you know it's the

1557.47 --> 1563.14
second time you're doing this making

1559.87 --> 1566.2199999999998
ridiculous outrageous claims just like

1563.14 --> 1570.01
you did with ace MacLeod remember and

1566.22 --> 1571.029
now it cost you your wrench but that

1570.01 --> 1573.309
doesn't mean I don't want this

1571.029 --> 1576.299
conversation to continue though but just

1573.309 --> 1576.299
yeah

1578.399 --> 1589.12
all right Paige well look it's just it

1584.889 --> 1591.279
feels really stupid when people just say

1589.12 --> 1596.2299999999998
he stabbed his friends in the back

1591.279 --> 1599.59
because he didn't and he's very open

1596.23 --> 1603.58
about everything he does with his ex

1599.59 --> 1606.1589999999999
friends why how that works and I think

1603.58 --> 1609.34
he even though I personally don't know

1606.159 --> 1610.8990000000001
all of these people as well as he

1609.34 --> 1611.559
probably does but I think he's pretty

1610.899 --> 1619.62
spot-on

1611.559 --> 1619.62
with a lot of it no

1629.669 --> 1632.239
what

1635.59 --> 1645.6999999999998
the late response weird no no he's not a

1643.6 --> 1646.6799999999998
racist and he's absolutely not a

1645.7 --> 1651.28
man-child

1646.68 --> 1656.92
he has a he still has a young spirit

1651.28 --> 1659.62
within him very fiery though and he is

1656.92 --> 1663.28
basically allowing that to manifest the

1659.62 --> 1666.3999999999999
way he does it at for comedy value and

1663.28 --> 1668.86
he's very clear about that okay so this

1666.4 --> 1671.41
is just really embarrassing to hear this

1668.86 --> 1673.78
kind of [ __ ] from people visiting my

1671.41 --> 1679.71
chat Harris it's it's probably time to

1673.78 --> 1679.71
ban a couple of people it's just stupid

1680.52 --> 1683.58
all right

1693.78 --> 1699.51
right

1695.88 --> 1702.15
it's brand-new yeah well you know what

1699.51 --> 1710.27
that is I know that's kind of tough to

1702.15 --> 1713.2800000000002
hear but it's just damn honesty okay and

1710.27 --> 1716.22
for a lot of men it's pretty tough to

1713.28 --> 1722.21
listen to the average woman talking if

1716.22 --> 1725.34
they don't love them it just that's true

1722.21 --> 1727.95
and I don't know maybe it's the other

1725.34 --> 1731.58
way around as well for some women that

1727.95 --> 1733.89
just can't stand some the average man

1731.58 --> 1737.31
talking and yeah the average man these

1733.89 --> 1743.63
days talks like a complete [ __ ] but no

1737.31 --> 1743.6299999999999
but and what the [ __ ] yes sorry it

1746.3 --> 1757.23
doesn't mean that we shouldn't try you

1750.0 --> 1760.44
know I listen to I know she understands

1757.23 --> 1762.9
me at this I listened to my very good

1760.44 --> 1765.15
friend over the telephone again that I

1762.9 --> 1767.49
visited that a month ago remember and

1765.15 --> 1769.73
she was talking to me like how she was

1767.49 --> 1773.28
basically falling in love again with

1769.73 --> 1775.5
like her first boyfriend from long ago

1773.28 --> 1777.24
and that now open up and just all the

1775.5 --> 1783.18
feeling talk and that went on for two

1777.24 --> 1785.1
hours well I am like the best and I I

1783.18 --> 1789.03
want to be for her but after two hours

1785.1 --> 1791.61
she literally started asking me like are

1789.03 --> 1795.8
you okay you're sighing a lot and I was

1791.61 --> 1798.54
like yes it's getting kind of tiresome

1795.8 --> 1800.82
so yeah it's true

1798.54 --> 1803.6399999999999
that doesn't mean that we shouldn't

1800.82 --> 1807.35
listen to women but it is kind of

1803.64 --> 1810.42
tiresome sometimes it's just a fact and

1807.35 --> 1812.1299999999999
yeah I don't know I don't know why

1810.42 --> 1815.51
anybody would have a lot a big problem

1812.13 --> 1815.5100000000002
with that you know

1823.549 --> 1836.6589999999999
that's why brenda is not a woman and

1825.86 --> 1839.809
what's really easy now so what does what

1836.659 --> 1844.7600000000002
does that mean to you Wolfgang what does

1839.809 --> 1848.08
that mean to you better start giving a

1844.76 --> 1854.029
good explanation you better be on target

1848.08 --> 1858.529
or I'm probably gonna ban you so you

1854.029 --> 1863.62
tell me why is Owen Benjamin an obvious

1858.529 --> 1863.62
anti-semite explain it

1879.799 --> 1885.65
exactly pumpkin yeah Owens wife is is

1886.669 --> 1893.25
you can see she has weight on her

1890.85 --> 1894.9289999999999
shoulders as a mother and she's taking

1893.25 --> 1897.03
very seriously but at the same time

1894.929 --> 1897.48
there's just a lot of shine coming offer

1897.03 --> 1905.19
it

1897.48 --> 1908.15
I think Owens wife is pretty impressive

1905.19 --> 1908.15
as a person

1920.61 --> 1925.1999999999998
it's getting really annoying phase

1940.51 --> 1954.1
Oh oh well that makes perfect sense then

1948.16 --> 1955.96
Wolfgang yeah yeah if you're going in

1954.1 --> 1960.04
the ditch then anybody else must be

1955.96 --> 1961.8700000000001
doing that as well it's ridiculous do

1960.04 --> 1963.79
you even know what anti-semite means

1961.87 --> 1967.54
where it's coming from

1963.79 --> 1972.75
it's just just it's kind of a dumb thing

1967.54 --> 1976.3899999999999
to say no look

1972.75 --> 1982.65
Wolfgang Owen is not an anti-semite he

1976.39 --> 1982.65
even says yes he has jewnicorn friends

1983.04 --> 1989.08
absolutely he differentiates he's not

1985.87 --> 1995.6789999999999
over generalizing he's just slaughtering

1989.08 --> 1998.4099999999999
that sacred cow because well Jewish

1995.679 --> 2000.6000000000001
communities and individuals rich

1998.41 --> 2004.98
individuals have spent a lot of effort

2000.6 --> 2008.58
into making sure that nobody can

2004.98 --> 2011.549
criticize anything about them or things

2008.58 --> 2015.6
they were involved in with the label

2011.549 --> 2017.94
anti-semite but it doesn't make any damn

2015.6 --> 2022.83
sense because Jews aren't really even

2017.94 --> 2028.26
Semites or well usually the ones that

2022.83 --> 2031.98
claim it because that's more like well

2028.26 --> 2034.5
the arabian palestinian people the local

2031.98 --> 2041.88
people of that region so it's all just a

2034.5 --> 2044.549
ridiculous it's a spell they're giving a

2041.88 --> 2047.19
word it sounds oh my god you are an T

2044.549 --> 2052.8
this people don't even look further into

2047.19 --> 2055.08
it and that's what it's supposed to be

2052.8 --> 2057.9900000000002
it's supposed to be a stopper a stop

2055.08 --> 2061.129
word to make people stop in their tracks

2057.99 --> 2064.379
and stop going doing what they're doing

2061.129 --> 2066.679
whatever it is because it doesn't make

2064.379 --> 2066.679
any sense

2069.109 --> 2079.589
but then just go and saying that you're

2076.049 --> 2085.529
an anti-semite and oh yeah he is an

2079.589 --> 2090.24
anti-semite to it dude what are you

2085.529 --> 2096.419
doing where is this gonna lead to why

2090.24 --> 2100.4399999999996
didn't you just go for the behaviors and

2096.419 --> 2104.24
the individuals and their behavior and

2100.44 --> 2108.089
the problems and and not stick to their

2104.24 --> 2110.49
psychological warfare lingo meant for us

2108.089 --> 2113.549
why are you going with that

2110.49 --> 2114.93
I think that's trolling or something

2113.549 --> 2118.5
that's not gonna work

2114.93 --> 2124.46
silly you need to dispel the spell not

2118.5 --> 2124.46
just take it with pride it's ridiculous

2132.49 --> 2145.7799999999997
- okay all right good so yeah don't

2139.72 --> 2149.1699999999996
catch me seeing you don't let me catch

2145.78 --> 2156.42
you saying kind anti-satellite just

2149.17 --> 2156.42
silly dude anyway all right yeah

2161.2 --> 2168.97
good yeah as for criticizing gay people

2166.51 --> 2172.3590000000004
and trends and everything I'm kind of

2168.97 --> 2177.819
fine with that as you know I am kind of

2172.359 --> 2180.22
a self-admitted homophobe and it's not

2177.819 --> 2183.73
out of any principle it's just a

2180.22 --> 2185.4399999999996
physical allergy or an energy allergy

2183.73 --> 2186.849
you could say it has to it's weird how

2185.44 --> 2192.309
that works because there is something

2186.849 --> 2195.7000000000003
about that energy there is yeah I might

2192.309 --> 2199.0890000000004
talk about that a little more deeply at

2195.7 --> 2201.8799999999997
some point although Owen Benjamin did

2199.089 --> 2204.25
really does really talk about exactly

2201.88 --> 2208.9300000000003
that it's the sphere it is the energy of

2204.25 --> 2211.299
it where it will lead to and just

2208.93 --> 2213.43
because somebody is homosexual that

2211.299 --> 2216.549
doesn't mean that is automatically gonna

2213.43 --> 2221.98
stumble into the darkness deeply but

2216.549 --> 2225.19
they may risk it more happening doesn't

2221.98 --> 2227.98
mean that it will and I'd rather just go

2225.19 --> 2229.869
point at the people that are actually in

2227.98 --> 2238.27
the middle of stumbling into the

2229.869 --> 2241.51
darkness visibly and that could be

2238.27 --> 2244.839
people that are just going so Vanya

2241.51 --> 2247.38
raging or that I then declare yeah

2244.839 --> 2252.7599999999998
you're acting like a bunch of facts and

2247.38 --> 2255.609
with [ __ ] I mean whiny old lady that

2252.76 --> 2262.0890000000004
nobody wants to listen to not

2255.609 --> 2264.369
necessarily homosexual because yeah many

2262.089 --> 2268.21
people that I call out Asif anya's that

2264.369 --> 2271.21
immediately there are [ __ ] they needed

2268.21 --> 2272.92
it but who I just had sex with a woman

2271.21 --> 2275.89
oh really

2272.92 --> 2278.079
well you're still a [ __ ] because it's not

2275.89 --> 2279.069
about who you have sex with it's about

2278.079 --> 2289.15
how you're behaving

2279.069 --> 2292.22
a hag no a haggis is another thing now

2289.15 --> 2295.7000000000003
[ __ ] is traditionally a

2292.22 --> 2300.64
an old lady that would carry tweaks from

2295.7 --> 2303.3799999999997
the bushels they would gather firewood

2300.64 --> 2306.5299999999997
that those were facts they had baskets

2303.38 --> 2309.77
and then they would just gather branches

2306.53 --> 2314.829
half the day it's very old it's it's

2309.77 --> 2314.829
like before World War one period

2315.31 --> 2324.7999999999997
probably during World Wars as well but

2320.65 --> 2330.109
anyway yeah the hag is something else a

2324.8 --> 2334.76
hag is it's really like a possessed

2330.109 --> 2336.95
which like a woman that is in full rage

2334.76 --> 2341.7200000000003
and is not gonna snap out of it and they

2336.95 --> 2344.75
become evil and dark and potentially

2341.72 --> 2347.06
murderous well probably yeah that's not

2344.75 --> 2351.2
even how the general terminology about

2347.06 --> 2354.68
it is but weirdly enough and this is

2351.2 --> 2357.77
weird is that in D&D in Dungeons and

2354.68 --> 2360.3689999999997
Dragons cosmology there are hags as well

2357.77 --> 2363.579
and they are like an overemphasis of

2360.369 --> 2368.1800000000003
that concept there are like monsters

2363.579 --> 2370.849
curse it almost troll like monsters that

2368.18 --> 2377.24
literally devour that lure in men and

2370.849 --> 2380.589
then literally devour them but it's not

2377.24 --> 2380.589
the same thing it's different

2380.71 --> 2388.69
the hag is definitely completely

2384.079 --> 2394.19
consumed by darkness and a [ __ ] is just

2388.69 --> 2396.41
somebody that's just pulling attention

2394.19 --> 2401.839
to themselves being disruptive being

2396.41 --> 2408.0989999999997
egotistical and very offensive that's

2401.839 --> 2412.069
what I call a [ __ ] like a female spider

2408.099 --> 2414.29
yeah right like a black widow

2412.069 --> 2416.92
peanuts Clarke sort of that that could

2414.29 --> 2416.92
be a hag

2422.04 --> 2432.44
yeah and a [ __ ] is also a smoke indeed

2424.77 --> 2436.2599999999998
that's true or they used to call it that

2432.44 --> 2443.52
it's so weird how all these meanings all

2436.26 --> 2446.67
kind of got confiscated by the gay lingo

2443.52 --> 2448.77
isn't it they literally just confiscated

2446.67 --> 2450.2400000000002
all these words they aren't confiscated

2448.77 --> 2453.69
the word gay which originally meant

2450.24 --> 2456.8399999999997
happy a [ __ ] which could mean all kinds

2453.69 --> 2459.2400000000002
of things and yeah the dude community

2456.84 --> 2462.1200000000003
just started to take all these words and

2459.24 --> 2464.1299999999997
then kind of claim it to the gay scene

2462.12 --> 2466.35
and then suddenly every time those words

2464.13 --> 2469.1400000000003
would be uttered it would be off the gay

2466.35 --> 2471.81
scene and now suddenly if you're not gay

2469.14 --> 2475.95
you can't use these words anymore yeah

2471.81 --> 2481.11
that's been happening for decades do you

2475.95 --> 2485.8799999999997
see it do you see how that happened can

2481.11 --> 2488.4
you feel it and that's also why I am

2485.88 --> 2495.2400000000002
literally basically reclaiming the word

2488.4 --> 2499.25
[ __ ] cuz yeah I used to accept that that

2495.24 --> 2499.25
can only mean a gay person

2503.41 --> 2508.029
but at the same time it's funny because

2505.48 --> 2510.64
it does still kind of trigger that and

2508.029 --> 2512.349
that goes towards the energy in the

2510.64 --> 2516.0589999999997
direction of what I'm actually pointing

2512.349 --> 2521.71
at so I'm kind of double using the word

2516.059 --> 2525.759
but my official use for it is not a gay

2521.71 --> 2529.0190000000002
person but just a whiny old lady that

2525.759 --> 2529.0190000000002
makes everything about them

2534.449 --> 2539.17
changing words is the part of

2536.559 --> 2543.1890000000003
dumbing-down process well it's not

2539.17 --> 2546.369
changing words it's just taking away the

2543.189 --> 2549.0989999999997
meanings of words and forcing it to be

2546.369 --> 2551.859
narrowed down to one meaning so that the

2549.099 --> 2554.7090000000003
other meanings of them are lost within

2551.859 --> 2557.259
language and within the mind that is

2554.709 --> 2561.999
what they do they don't change the words

2557.259 --> 2566.589
themselves they just Ram some kind of

2561.999 --> 2569.229
new modern hypey meaning over it and

2566.589 --> 2570.969
then they forced that to replace it

2569.229 --> 2572.8289999999997
that's what they are doing

2570.969 --> 2575.38
that's what pop culture has been doing

2572.829 --> 2579.2490000000003
also a lot they're on the forefront of

2575.38 --> 2584.259
that [ __ ] as is Hollywood and it slips

2579.249 --> 2589.0789999999997
in and it slips in very slowly so it's

2584.259 --> 2591.91
such a gradual process that in a decade

2589.079 --> 2593.829
barely anything really changes but if

2591.91 --> 2597.5989999999997
you take a time span of five decades

2593.829 --> 2600.069
then you see how gradual and how

2597.599 --> 2601.989
impactful the meanings really are how

2600.069 --> 2603.729
they have changed but in a small time

2601.989 --> 2606.489
span you don't notice this and that is

2603.729 --> 2608.89
why typically young people especially

2606.489 --> 2611.229
teenagers that just don't have a feeling

2608.89 --> 2613.0589999999997
for a long time than for gradual change

2611.229 --> 2614.9489999999996
that's why they all fall for it that's

2613.059 --> 2619.2690000000002
why they'll think oh this is now this is

2614.949 --> 2621.699
modern I'm gonna be doing that and then

2619.269 --> 2624.4889999999996
later if they're lucky they figure out

2621.699 --> 2626.799
wow that's that's really messed up what

2624.489 --> 2632.259
I was a part of maybe I should do that

2626.799 --> 2634.599
anymore if you're lucky but that's part

2632.259 --> 2636.13
of the trick that's how they draw in the

2634.599 --> 2638.259
young people because the young people

2636.13 --> 2642.759
just don't have a feel for the long term

2638.259 --> 2644.979
manipulation that is being done with the

2642.759 --> 2647.549
media and information that is handed out

2644.979 --> 2647.549
to the public

2649.859 --> 2657.64
that's right peanuts Clark there's much

2653.049 --> 2661.599
more personal language in it in in the

2657.64 --> 2664.3799999999997
80s movies there's more down-to-earth

2661.599 --> 2664.38
still

2673.13 --> 2675.13
ah

2682.93 --> 2690.749
right so

2686.64 --> 2695.73
now I hope I cleared up with with this

2690.749 --> 2698.64
speech why there is no problem at all at

2695.73 --> 2701.73
being a fan of Owen Benjamin and that

2698.64 --> 2704.48
previous accusation seemed pretty silly

2701.73 --> 2704.48
Dante

2710.98 --> 2718.92
indeed try this peach

2726.01 --> 2745.51
oh wow oh that's amazing

2732.9 --> 2747.31
Wow it's just amazing such a long time

2745.51 --> 2755.98
ago and like overwhelmed by the

2747.31 --> 2761.0099999999998
sensation the taste of it hmm and it's

2755.98 --> 2761.01

why are you a spare a spare room music

2798.18 --> 2802.68
why are you asking a misleading question

2800.25 --> 2805.56
who said that it doesn't matter if

2802.68 --> 2808.37
somebody is gay I'm pretty sure you're

2805.56 --> 2808.37
the one saying that

2830.01 --> 2837.57
[Music]

2831.72 --> 2837.5699999999997
gay is a sin hmm I don't know

2840.63 --> 2846.84
I don't really know if it is but it

2845.1 --> 2848.94
depends on what what you're gonna

2846.84 --> 2851.7000000000003
approach it how you're gonna approach it

2848.94 --> 2853.58
is it is it a sin to fall in love with

2851.7 --> 2859.47
somebody that is of the same sex

2853.58 --> 2864.15
knowingly or is it a sin to engage in

2859.47 --> 2865.98
homosexual activity you know is it

2864.15 --> 2869.84
really about the sodomy and the butt

2865.98 --> 2872.4900000000002
pumping us Owen calls it I don't think

2869.84 --> 2875.9700000000003
why would it be a sin to fall in love

2872.49 --> 2878.5099999999998
with somebody that doesn't make any

2875.97 --> 2878.5099999999998
sense to me

2885.849 --> 2901.9
I have no idea saucy London I don't

2892.42 --> 2904.509
really care Reesie I don't know there's

2901.9 --> 2909.759
probably not a huge quantity of gay

2904.509 --> 2913.959
people in the flatter scene because yeah

2909.759 --> 2919.319
I don't know in general atheism is a lot

2913.959 --> 2922.8999999999996
more friendly even pro all of that

2919.319 --> 2929.369
trying to say no it's not it's not wrong

2922.9 --> 2931.809
it's just normal we need all that and

2929.369 --> 2933.279
well if you're religious I don't know

2931.809 --> 2939.549
you just take it a little bit more

2933.279 --> 2940.329
serious like it's technically quite

2939.549 --> 2947.849
simple

2940.329 --> 2947.849
there's just consequences to living gay

2950.279 --> 2955.289
it's not like just a random thing to do

2963.83 --> 2971.5099999999998
and that in my opinion is also the way

2967.62 --> 2971.5099999999998
to really approach what sin is

2976.71 --> 2986.099
a sin is is self apparent real sin you

2985.41 --> 2988.799
feel it

2986.099 --> 2991.799
you know it you feel it coming it's real

2988.799 --> 2996.359
and you have an extra sense for it if

2991.799 --> 2999.2
you haven't destroyed it yet by yeah

2996.359 --> 3004.549
breaking with it and denying it

2999.2 --> 3005.1499999999996
persistently doing bad things and that's

3004.549 --> 3008.17
just it

3005.15 --> 3008.17
you feel it

3018.319 --> 3025.699
Nosa see London I I again do flat

3023.749 --> 3026.209
earthers want to cut them what are you

3025.699 --> 3034.609
doing

are you just you would would you really

3034.609 --> 3039.049
love it

3035.63 --> 3041.9590000000003
Sasi London if flat earthers would

3039.049 --> 3045.14
officially sign on to the alt-right and

3041.959 --> 3048.1989999999996
wagon you would love that wouldn't you

3045.14 --> 3050.8089999999997
saucy London would make us such an easy

3048.199 --> 3053.38
target to just get rid of us then

3050.809 --> 3055.9990000000003
suddenly the left will be so much

3053.38 --> 3058.329
inclined to remove us all you wouldn't

3055.999 --> 3063.89

[Music]

3073.1 --> 3078.65

3076.7 --> 3081.2

3078.65 --> 3083.9900000000002
creation I'm about God and about the

3081.2 --> 3088.1
truth and about the spiritual world and

3083.99 --> 3092.95
its consequences nobody gives a [ __ ]

3088.1 --> 3094.46
about who is gay and who is not okay

3092.95 --> 3097.99
nobody cares

3094.46 --> 3097.9900000000002
it's not important

3117.12 --> 3127.69
yeah yeah they'd love to try that delete

3120.04 --> 3132.67
delete no there's just one little

3127.69 --> 3135.67
problem with that and that is that a lot

3132.67 --> 3138.79
of people whether they openly admitted

3135.67 --> 3142.78
or not are very much aware about what

3138.79 --> 3144.82
Flat Earth is about so every time some

3142.78 --> 3147.4900000000002
kind of great media group is trying to

3144.82 --> 3150.28
look how stupid this is just like Flat

3147.49 --> 3152.95
Earth it actually backfires there's

3150.28 --> 3158.2000000000003
still a sizable chunk of people it works

3152.95 --> 3163.21
on but there is a gradually growing

3158.2 --> 3166.83
amount of people that respond quite the

3163.21 --> 3166.83
opposite so

3180.84 --> 3187.29
mm-hmm gonna need some assistance here

3192.7 --> 3200.5789999999997
yeah a troll you're a [ __ ]

3197.43 --> 3203.859
you don't even understand

3200.579 --> 3208.9
you know that it's really [ __ ] dumb

3203.859 --> 3213.7799999999997
to call but somebody a beta we don't its

3208.9 --> 3213.78
beta is not that bad

3214.5 --> 3219.849
you should listen to own Benjamin a lot

3217.45 --> 3223.24
more before you start trolling with like

3219.849 --> 3224.349
really [ __ ] ten years outdated troll

3223.24 --> 3229.3489999999997
accusations

3224.349 --> 3229.349
it's really [ __ ] down really

3235.52 --> 3241.55
you know what I'm just gonna leave it

3237.14 --> 3246.3799999999997
there it's so dumb maybe I'll just leave

3241.55 --> 3248.27
it up there it's yeah yeah we'll just

3246.38 --> 3258.29
leave it there it's so dumb

3248.27 --> 3263.56
oh and by the way concerning the soy

3258.29 --> 3268.1
yeah I've been advocating against soy

3263.56 --> 3272.42
for a long time and I never eat soy

3268.1 --> 3274.43
I only eat soy very very sometimes when

3272.42 --> 3280.52
it just happened to be a part in some

3274.43 --> 3283.43
kind of you know thingy but you I never

3280.52 --> 3285.65
use any of that as staple food ever

3283.43 --> 3288.08
that's usually the exception so on the

3285.65 --> 3291.4900000000002
average I might eat something that has

3288.08 --> 3295.5499999999997
some soil in it maybe once a month

3291.49 --> 3300.22
literally once a month and that's all

3295.55 --> 3302.8100000000004
the soy that I eat it's very little and

3300.22 --> 3305.8399999999997
I'm not feeling that at all thank God

3302.81 --> 3310.46
because I hate soy it's disgusting I

3305.84 --> 3313.8500000000004
literally think it's disgusting and I'm

3310.46 --> 3317.48
glad to share that I have not undergone

3313.85 --> 3320.15
any soy body modification because I've

3317.48 --> 3322.58
been very careful with soy for a very

3320.15 --> 3324.83
long time since the Alex Jones time when

3322.58 --> 3330.89
that was brought forth even before that

3324.83 --> 3333.5299999999997
I knew that soy was is being used for

3330.89 --> 3338.75
hormone treatment with all the ladies

3333.53 --> 3343.4300000000003
because it just creates estrogen and if

3338.75 --> 3345.38
you take that in as a man then your body

3343.43 --> 3347.6
starts to degenerate because of it and

3345.38 --> 3350.3900000000003
I'm pretty damn sure that I've not

3347.6 --> 3354.2599999999998
undergone that thank God and I've seen

3350.39 --> 3357.25
people that have and it's disgusting and

3354.26 --> 3357.25
repulsive

3359.42 --> 3368.04
I'd associate with people like that

3361.95 --> 3370.3199999999997
eventually so like even if you're if

3368.04 --> 3372.119
you're a leftist or whatever or you hate

3370.32 --> 3375.4500000000003
Trump and I got some friends that do

3372.119 --> 3378.3
from a gaming group I will still tell

3375.45 --> 3382.6189999999997
them don't freaking eat soy just don't

3378.3 --> 3386.28
do it like I am gonna tell you don't do

3382.619 --> 3388.4100000000003
it because I want to be playing the

3386.28 --> 3392.0400000000004
indie with you in 40 years time I don't

3388.41 --> 3394.23
want you to become seriously unhealthy

3392.04 --> 3397.23
or psychologically deranged over time

3394.23 --> 3399.0
and just die from that [ __ ] and the good

3397.23 --> 3402.39
thing is that they did kind of listen

3399.0 --> 3404.7
they did do some like natural news

3402.39 --> 3407.3689999999997
research they're not in complete idiots

3404.7 --> 3409.3799999999997
they just have their based sources that

3407.369 --> 3410.79
lean to the left a lot and that

3409.38 --> 3412.6800000000003
brainwashes them a little but they're

3410.79 --> 3415.77
not completed it's just a little

3412.68 --> 3420.2
oblivious here and there and yeah I tell

3415.77 --> 3423.18
them just don't don't eat soy just don't

3420.2 --> 3425.9399999999996
and none of them are vegetarian or a

3423.18 --> 3428.7
vegan or anything so I thought yeah they

3425.94 --> 3432.2000000000003
prefer meat anyway I am the vegetarian

3428.7 --> 3435.77
among them and weirdly enough but yeah

3432.2 --> 3435.77
it is what it is

3437.329 --> 3446.3
well Wolfgang okay that's at least an

3440.97 --> 3446.2999999999997
honest question yeah

3452.79 --> 3455.79
houki

3459.98 --> 3468.02
Miyoko yeah Wow got a lot of trolls

3463.67 --> 3471.71
today but you are present Omega really

3468.02 --> 3474.859
full gang really Oh Hannah bear thank

3471.71 --> 3479.15
you yours you say I'm a Sigma I don't

3474.859 --> 3484.72
know maybe I am I really always

3479.15 --> 3487.9100000000003
considered myself to be a beta cuz of

3484.72 --> 3490.58
the group function it like Owen Benjamin

3487.91 --> 3493.64
described himself as a beta and that

3490.58 --> 3496.22
resonates a lot with me like I do like

3493.64 --> 3499.96
to have some sort of leadership but I'm

3496.22 --> 3503.54
not good at distancing myself as a

3499.96 --> 3505.78
leader from the group for a long time it

3503.54 --> 3510.07
drains me out so I can like take

3505.78 --> 3513.32
emergency control maybe in situations

3510.07 --> 3515.869
making me potentially a good beta but I

3513.32 --> 3518.3300000000004
don't think I'm an alpha and the Sigma

3515.869 --> 3520.2200000000003
thing I don't I don't really and I

3518.33 --> 3525.2
haven't really lucked into all of that

3520.22 --> 3527.8999999999996
too much now but Trish Blythe beta is

3525.2 --> 3530.41
not an insult that is the stupid thing

3527.9 --> 3530.4100000000003
about it

3530.74 --> 3541.4599999999996
be glad if you're a beta the people that

3536.359 --> 3543.56
that we think suck okay they're the

3541.46 --> 3548.65
troll the annoying ones those are the

3543.56 --> 3548.65
gammas it's very different category

3552.7 --> 3561.89
betas are typically good right hand man

3557.72 --> 3567.0499999999997
and I am like that I always considered

3561.89 --> 3571.2799999999997
myself to be let's just say in the in

3567.05 --> 3580.2200000000003
the in the deck of cards I'd be the the

3571.28 --> 3584.3
King's advisor or a system and that is a

3580.22 --> 3589.0699999999997
beta role but I've never really as I

3584.3 --> 3593.32
never aspired to be like the the man the

3589.07 --> 3596.3900000000003
front the King the whatever a leader no

3593.32 --> 3599.1200000000003
my prime objectives every time I want

3596.39 --> 3601.73
really to build something or to get

3599.12 --> 3605.12
somewhere it is that I want things to

3601.73 --> 3607.16
exist and if I want to have it done

3605.12 --> 3609.83
right I'll have to do it myself that's

3607.16 --> 3612.92
always where that comes from but I don't

3609.83 --> 3615.14
want to be the king of an empire like I

3612.92 --> 3624.02
don't want that scenario I don't like

3615.14 --> 3625.85
that and that makes me not an alpha but

3624.02 --> 3630.11
I'm fine being a beta and on the other

3625.85 --> 3633.43
hand I maybe I am the Sigma that you

3630.11 --> 3633.4300000000003
talk about but I don't know

3640.25 --> 3648.92
how do you know I'm not a bit a beta

3642.349 --> 3652.6090000000004
Trish Blythe you're saying this like

3648.92 --> 3656.359
look the whole you're a beta you're a

3652.609 --> 3659.9
beta oh you're such a beta that's it was

3656.359 --> 3663.2
a malformation it's wrong it's a it's a

3659.9 --> 3665.2400000000002
broken meme in retrospect I'm kind of

3663.2 --> 3668.27
embarrassed and I think that it came

3665.24 --> 3671.0
from where yeah the 4chan whatever

3668.27 --> 3672.619
trollish meme and eventually Infowars

3671.0 --> 3676.55
kind of took over that word but it's

3672.619 --> 3678.53
kind of wrong it should be a gamma beta

3676.55 --> 3681.8
us there's a lot of betas in the world

3678.53 --> 3684.7400000000002
and there are generally pretty good

3681.8 --> 3690.4700000000003
people useful people that have skills

3684.74 --> 3692.39
and that are eager to help out on the

3690.47 --> 3696.6499999999996
other hand they're really the more eager

3692.39 --> 3699.609
they get to help out and not be steering

3696.65 --> 3703.609
things if you're really not good at

3699.609 --> 3705.29
taking control and really only want to

3703.609 --> 3715.5789999999997
assist then you get into the Delta

3705.29 --> 3717.849
category if I'm not mistaken anyway Fox

3715.579 --> 3717.849
Day

3719.46 --> 3726.03
all right now Fox Day just expanded upon

3724.109 --> 3731.67
it I don't think he originally invented

3726.03 --> 3734.28
it well maybe he has I don't know but

3731.67 --> 3737.099
I'm sure it pretty sure the whole uberta

3734.28 --> 3749.15
[ __ ] meme has been going around for

3737.099 --> 3751.579
years really you did huh Wow okay

3749.15 --> 3753.71
okay I didn't know that I thought it was

3751.579 --> 3756.38
a long-term thing that was just

3753.71 --> 3758.7400000000002
uncovered but okay maybe he invented it

3756.38 --> 3762.65
I don't know I think it's an interesting

3758.74 --> 3766.089
system it's an interesting character

3762.65 --> 3766.089
categorization system

3774.26 --> 3780.98
right Wolfgang if all men would be

3777.35 --> 3783.38
alphas then there would be war

3780.98 --> 3786.44
it'll be slaughtering one another until

3783.38 --> 3798.19
like one is left that's problem with

3786.44 --> 3798.19
alphas yeah soy sauce get out here

3808.95 --> 3813.87
[Music]

3811.01 --> 3818.3100000000004
all right and you don't want to all be

3813.87 --> 3820.8599999999997
alphas alpha is like a glorious face it

3818.31 --> 3824.13
is the leader it is somebody you'd be

3820.86 --> 3827.76
inclined to know what it's not really

3824.13 --> 3832.35
that fun being successful alpha is just

3827.76 --> 3835.7700000000004
huge pressure that you as an alpha being

3832.35 --> 3839.52
built for that have unique qualities to

3835.77 --> 3843.36
to actually do that and not break down

3839.52 --> 3846.24
or whatever go insane that's why they're

3843.36 --> 3848.2200000000003
alphas but it's not a lot of fun to be

3846.24 --> 3852.1699999999996
an alpha that is in control you know

3848.22 --> 3854.97
it's never really fun to be in control

3852.17 --> 3856.83
unless you're just yeah abusing

3854.97 --> 3858.72
everything and then you're just using it

3856.83 --> 3861.48
but if you're really trying to maintain

3858.72 --> 3863.91
things take care or be a king a good one

3861.48 --> 3869.88
that's just a lot of responsibility and

3863.91 --> 3872.6099999999997
stress so it's not a lot of fun it is

3869.88 --> 3877.02
however a very necessary and that is

3872.61 --> 3882.21
also a big part of it all of us are also

3877.02 --> 3886.34
called to necessity although betas are

3882.21 --> 3886.34
probably even more call to necessity

3886.58 --> 3891.81
it's it's probably the most situation

3889.92 --> 3894.0
that will arrive that will draw a lot of

3891.81 --> 3898.41
attention or reform things it would be

3894.0 --> 3901.98
betas that would be creating something a

3898.41 --> 3905.43
movement and then drag in the right

3901.98 --> 3909.21
alpha to be the cherry on top of the pie

3905.43 --> 3911.3399999999997
but it's rarely the alpha that starts

3909.21 --> 3914.73
something from the grassroots up that

3911.34 --> 3918.09
rarely happens it's usually the betas

3914.73 --> 3920.34
that go out and make it happen anyway

3918.09 --> 3922.83
I'm gonna round out the show it's been

3920.34 --> 3924.48
interesting if you like the show as well

3922.83 --> 3926.8199999999997
