so join me anyway the weather today is

85.899 --> 95.479
very different but surprisingly it's

91.46 --> 99.979
still very warm so it's yeah it seems

95.479 --> 101.899
like with this type of weather you'd

99.979 --> 105.74
expect that there's going to be some

101.899 --> 108.61
kind of big thunderstorm and all that at

105.74 --> 111.56
some point because it is kind of windy

108.61 --> 116.18
it's completely clouded everywhere but

111.56 --> 120.77000000000001
it's still so warm like the wind is warm

116.18 --> 126.25
it stays warm and yeah it's really moist

120.77 --> 126.25
everywhere so yeah

127.29 --> 136.77
I don't know I haven't had one of these

129.69 --> 165.0
types of days yet this year Jack dogs

136.77 --> 167.16000000000003
are getting busy all right I should

165.0 --> 169.43
definitely keep that door open for fresh

167.16 --> 169.43
air

177.83 --> 189.74
it lasts three to four weeks well is it

181.94 --> 194.2
as warm as this because this is not just

189.74 --> 194.20000000000002
clouded it's very warm and clouded

194.44 --> 202.94
anyway I'm gonna look through chat that

200.18 --> 207.38
oh yeah of course I got some to wear a

202.94 --> 214.22
coffee with me because yeah I got a very

207.38 --> 216.68
early but Karen B did it stream quite a

214.22 --> 219.02
while ago was it like six o'clock for me

216.68 --> 222.19
but yeah I kind of got up at 6 o'clock

219.02 --> 226.34
because I went to bed at just insane

222.19 --> 230.78
insanely early kind of like felt asleep

226.34 --> 232.72
in the evening might be because the

230.78 --> 237.34
temperature was starting to drop down

232.72 --> 237.34
and it was just very much indeed asleep

242.22 --> 247.96
so I've been up very early but then

245.56 --> 250.93
after like an hour after that I went

247.96 --> 252.61
back to bed again although I did get to

250.93 --> 257.8
see just so much of these super early

252.61 --> 261.57
mornings and it's really surprising how

257.8 --> 265.57
light it is at such an early time

261.57 --> 269.14
there's no Sun visible yet but it's so

265.57 --> 277.57
light it's it's pretty much as light as

269.14 --> 283.06
this yeah it just boggles me like the

277.57 --> 286.93
experience of it but I yeah that kind of

283.06 --> 290.08
morning though with yeah plenty of

286.93 --> 292.89
lights and the temperatures right it's

290.08 --> 295.51
like that those are potentially very

292.89 --> 298.81
productive mornings if you yeah if you

295.51 --> 301.96
have planned work and all that I did

298.81 --> 307.6
feel that and I'm trying to engage

301.96 --> 309.25
myself and ordering a thing that seems

307.6 --> 315.01000000000005
to be the hardest thing in the world

309.25 --> 318.7
right now I actually had to trying to

315.01 --> 320.71
get yeah I got my phone switched was not

318.7 --> 323.38
like permanently it's like I got an

320.71 --> 329.08
extra iPhone 4 from my dad his old

323.38 --> 333.37
iPhone so that I can overcome certain

329.08 --> 335.8
phone only systems that apparently a lot

333.37 --> 337.42
of things require these days it annoys

335.8 --> 339.85
the hell out of me that it works like

337.42 --> 343.24
that like oh yeah you have to now do

339.85 --> 344.34000000000003
this very specific app thing so oh great

343.24 --> 347.17
great

344.34 --> 351.09999999999997
so I can't do that unless I have a

347.17 --> 354.37
freaking iPhone that sucks so because of

351.1 --> 358.39000000000004
that because I bumped into these kind of

354.37 --> 362.8
issues before I get an iPhone and but

358.39 --> 365.22999999999996
like it's I'm terrible at it I like I

362.8 --> 368.2
really hate those things

365.23 --> 372.54
so it's not easy for me to just like oh

368.2 --> 372.53999999999996
yeah yeah just work through it and no

374.26 --> 380.96
and yeah it's not even basically letting

377.78 --> 385.94
me in it's asking for codes and I didn't

380.96 --> 389.62
know where they are and anyway I'll

385.94 --> 392.12
figure it out feel like such a Boomer

389.62 --> 394.16
but yeah I kind of asked for it because

392.12 --> 397.13
I've always outright rejected this

394.16 --> 400.58000000000004
system well kind of for this reason I'm

397.13 --> 403.15999999999997
very displeased that there's just

400.58 --> 407.53999999999996
programs and all that that literally

403.16 --> 411.41
demand you have a freaking iPhone that

407.54 --> 412.94
you can't just use some kind of that's

411.41 --> 414.83000000000004
what I was thinking about in response

412.94 --> 418.19
like why isn't there just a phone

414.83 --> 421.96999999999997
emulator where you can just on your

418.19 --> 424.91
desktop just simulate an entire phone

421.97 --> 428.57000000000005
and you yeah you have to have of course

424.91 --> 432.58000000000004
like somehow access to a SIM card and

428.57 --> 435.14
all that I don't know how it would work

432.58 --> 439.07
but yeah that would make things a lot

435.14 --> 442.34
easier for me because I don't like those

439.07 --> 451.79
phone things the way the interface the

442.34 --> 454.21999999999997
touch screen I don't like it anyway I'll

451.79 --> 457.34000000000003
get to it because I'm really trying to

454.22 --> 459.41
yeah get the fresh air system while not

457.34 --> 466.15999999999997
the fresh air system anymore the Alexa

459.41 --> 472.58000000000004
pure the Alexa breeze system somehow but

466.16 --> 477.31
it's a giant hassle like really amazing

472.58 --> 477.31
how difficult it is to spend my money

477.49 --> 480.49
right

488.309 --> 492.67900000000003
everything I've ever done eatin advice

490.589 --> 497.989
give me done Pacey

492.679 --> 497.989
well not everything for me

507.75 --> 522.33
anyway yeah it's stuff right so what was

518.76 --> 524.58
I doing before all that oh yeah

522.33 --> 527.88
Coghlan Owen Benjamin life which is

524.58 --> 529.98
really interesting as usual though I'm

527.88 --> 532.35
completely lost again as to what he was

529.98 --> 534.89
talking about I just remembered that it

532.35 --> 534.89
was awesome

543.55 --> 551.25
alright Flat Earth debates very long

546.4 --> 551.25
after show a very very long after show

573.349 --> 578.899
still very hard by the way guys so sorry

576.119 --> 578.899
from bit slow

604.82 --> 608.5400000000001
okay tell ye

618.64 --> 629.35
yeah that's right Geron be stream it was

623.26 --> 632.86
seven hours ago by the way I also looked

629.35 --> 637.269
into another ropes keepeth video from

632.86 --> 640.149
his story approach that he's been onto

637.269 --> 648.279
for a long time it's interesting to go

640.149 --> 651.88
through that again all right

648.279 --> 655.8
oh yeah Karen B stream was about it was

651.88 --> 661.41
about a yeah controlled opposition

655.8 --> 661.41
anti-vaxxer she'll it's totally bizarre

662.64 --> 669.459
like this doctor I hadn't heard of him

666.16 --> 672.519
before that point but apparently he's

669.459 --> 675.0889999999999
like trying to give anti-vaxxers a bad

672.519 --> 678.13
name and then there was like this actor

675.089 --> 682.3900000000001
girl involved as well it's very busy

678.13 --> 686.709
I've never seen that before but like not

682.39 --> 691.8
with my physical eyes anyway have some

686.709 --> 691.8
weird memories of it vision wise what

694.98 --> 698.2
[Music]

702.29 --> 708.769
I guess we're sea cats yeah welcome to

705.919 --> 711.249
my chat again it's always interesting to

708.769 --> 714.079
see you or no not always

711.249 --> 717.049
do i watch videos on both sides of the

714.079 --> 719.569
argument well not really I'm not gonna

717.049 --> 723.35
if you mean flat earth ball earth

719.569 --> 725.829
situation because I rarely just like to

723.35 --> 728.66
hang around with people that are just

725.829 --> 730.669
unrestrictedly begging the question and

728.66 --> 732.459
asserting all kinds of blabbering

730.669 --> 736.429
nonsense

732.459 --> 738.41
endlessly because that's not a side of

736.429 --> 740.709
an argument it's just literally wasting

738.41 --> 743.629
my time with nonsense assertions and

740.709 --> 744.7689999999999
they're not really learning anything

743.629 --> 747.139
either

744.769 --> 749.059
can't even mention like any learning

747.139 --> 753.169
path like what have they learned in all

749.059 --> 757.7289999999999
this if you ever heard a baller really

753.169 --> 760.999
put that down effectively not really but

757.729 --> 764.109
yeah we can just there there can be

760.999 --> 768.109
debates that can be back and forth

764.109 --> 772.789
moments sometimes if the conditions are

768.109 --> 774.529
right and yeah I usually yeah if the

772.789 --> 776.449
ballers really have something that's

774.529 --> 779.269
worth and that's noteworthy not just

776.449 --> 782.539
blabbering blabbering on endlessly and

779.269 --> 788.029
they'll present that argument and it

782.539 --> 789.829
will be held up checked out and figured

788.029 --> 791.899
out if it is actually an argument

789.829 --> 795.3789999999999
especially in the context of the

791.899 --> 798.23
argumentation that is happening right so

795.379 --> 800.689
that's that's where I prefer to get my

798.23 --> 803.049
information not from safe space rooms

800.689 --> 805.669
where people just blabber on endlessly

803.049 --> 808.029
without actually having their facts

805.669 --> 808.029
checked

810.9 --> 814.02
you know

816.25 --> 828.62
it's like I'm I'm like a heliocentric

824.92 --> 831.7099999999999
presupposing enthusiast as it were you

828.62 --> 833.45
could call me that I like to dabble in

831.71 --> 839.1500000000001
those types of presupposition of thing I

833.45 --> 844.58
like to work with that construct but who

839.15 --> 847.34
of the ballers actually can do that with

844.58 --> 849.73
any kind of real flat flat earth

847.34 --> 853.4200000000001
conception because they're just so

849.73 --> 857.9
religiously offended by the existence of

853.42 --> 861.02
this non heliocentric thing called Flat

857.9 --> 862.9399999999999
Earth that they never really learned

861.02 --> 866.09
from it they never really as it they

862.94 --> 873.1400000000001
can't really step-by-step put it down

866.09 --> 876.32
and then understanding why because they

873.14 --> 879.29
like I've heard like people like rumpus

876.32 --> 881.5400000000001
in pretty rare moments like years ago do

879.29 --> 883.76
that at some point when people weren't

881.54 --> 886.55
all updated like concerning the

883.76 --> 888.68
housekeeping questions yet and it's

886.55 --> 890.99
really oh it always comes down to like

888.68 --> 892.88
if you're if you are if the if the

890.99 --> 897.23
waters are sufficiently calm if nobody's

892.88 --> 904.64
gonna catch you then you can put it all

897.23 --> 907.24
out and basically yeah reconstruct what

904.64 --> 911.75
the opponent is doing technically and

907.24 --> 914.9
then hand wave it afterward and ricked

911.75 --> 917.84
yeah resort to the typical busyness that

914.9 --> 919.73
happens in the science world and the

917.84 --> 922.1600000000001
colloquial science in the scientist

919.73 --> 924.71
world and that is philosophizing finding

922.16 --> 929.12
another reason as to why you can dismiss

924.71 --> 932.0300000000001
it never really on the same level there

929.12 --> 935.65
never any an empirical backing up it's

932.03 --> 935.65
usually diving into a philosophical

936.1 --> 941.03
fluffy thing that can be very

939.14 --> 943.55
intellectual sounding even even like

941.03 --> 946.2099999999999
worth pondering upon but has no relation

943.55 --> 947.9
really to the argument that that

946.21 --> 950.51
surrounds a

947.9 --> 954.28
sickle situation with empirical evidence

950.51 --> 958.79
and that's the ballers always tend to do

954.28 --> 960.5
if they even get to that point because

958.79 --> 963.98
nowadays yeah you don't get to that

960.5 --> 966.29
point because flatters does have are now

963.98 --> 968.27
wizened up and they don't really allow

966.29 --> 970.75
the waters to be that come for you to do

968.27 --> 970.75
that anymore

983.96 --> 994.74
so hope that answers your question that

990.78 --> 1000.8
probably didn't I think I went off track

994.74 --> 1006.07
a little with that but I rarely do hear

1000.8 --> 1009.92
any ballers nowadays being able to truly

1006.07 --> 1012.71
put down the the frame of reasoning the

1009.92 --> 1013.43
train of thought behind what the

1012.71 --> 1017.27
flat-earthers

1013.43 --> 1019.4
put in front of them they make fun of it

1017.27 --> 1021.74
like describing the process but they

1019.4 --> 1023.12
don't really see it for what it is they

1021.74 --> 1029.27
don't see it for a train of thought

1023.12 --> 1032.72
really well we me and Nathan and a lot

1029.27 --> 1035.99
of other that chocolate of course we do

1032.72 --> 1037.82
do that constantly we put down the

1035.99 --> 1041.54
entire train of thought with every piece

1037.82 --> 1044.8999999999999
of it all all referenceable to actual

1041.54 --> 1049.6399999999999
things said even to the individual level

1044.9 --> 1053.0900000000001
you know we flat earthers do this all

1049.64 --> 1057.0200000000002
the time with d presuppose heliocentric

1053.09 --> 1059.51
system train of thoughts well why aren't

1057.02 --> 1065.6299999999999
the ballers doing that with us why is

1059.51 --> 1070.64
that so incredibly difficult it's just

1065.63 --> 1074.68
very telling we have a grip on what they

1070.64 --> 1074.68
do they don't have a grip on what we do

1077.389 --> 1083.299
you know the thing that's really holding

1080.389 --> 1086.9789999999998
them up in the face of that Oh is just

1083.299 --> 1086.979
incredible stubbornness

1119.75 --> 1125.88
see yeah but that's the only thing you

1123.18 --> 1128.76
can do we have like even relatively

1125.88 --> 1133.2600000000002
moderate guys that can behave you know

1128.76 --> 1136.23
in normal circumstances you're even

1133.26 --> 1138.6
offended by the notion that maybe there

1136.23 --> 1141.1200000000001
is some sense to what we're doing and

1138.6 --> 1144.3
we're being open about it you you won't

1141.12 --> 1146.6399999999999
even allow yourself to accept that maybe

1144.3 --> 1153.1499999999999
there is a logic to what we do that is

1146.64 --> 1155.8100000000002
kind of sound because why otherwise

1153.15 --> 1162.14
would you just joke about that you know

1155.81 --> 1164.6399999999999
like there's no train of thought to be

1162.14 --> 1167.7900000000002
to be figured out or something like that

1164.64 --> 1171.38
it's just it sounds very funny you know

1167.79 --> 1171.3799999999999
but it's really just nonsense

1174.9 --> 1177.969
[Music]

1187.419 --> 1194.489
yeah yeah I have a sure but you had to

1192.129 --> 1198.089
make that joke though

1194.489 --> 1198.089
now be honest

1212.8 --> 1217.4199999999998
[Music]

1215.46 --> 1222.78
no yes

1217.42 --> 1226.3000000000002
some peoples have brains Daft hairy they

1222.78 --> 1231.52
they look into things for education that

1226.3 --> 1234.33
just entertainment I guess that's why

1231.52 --> 1239.47
you called yourself Daft Harry you know

1234.33 --> 1244.48
it's not just brilliant people trolling

1239.47 --> 1247.27
around and like that and this guy's been

1244.48 --> 1252.25
around for a long time and he names

1247.27 --> 1255.81
himself daft Harry I wonder if he even

1252.25 --> 1255.81
realize what that word means

1258.48 --> 1262.35
isn't that just special

1283.38 --> 1285.919
it

1286.169 --> 1288.7990000000002
what

1297.61 --> 1300.6
Harden's this

1304.21 --> 1314.5900000000001
Oh God space footage Janka that's never

1308.679 --> 1318.3990000000001
gonna work you can't convince ballers

1314.59 --> 1321.249
that space footage is really faking even

1318.399 --> 1323.7399999999998
if you manage to get that far they just

1321.249 --> 1325.69
start thinking that that was for some

1323.74 --> 1327.009
mysterious reason faked because they had

1325.69 --> 1329.94
to or something but there must be

1327.009 --> 1336.6390000000001
something real out there you know I

1329.94 --> 1344.769
wouldn't go there are you that anyway I

1336.639 --> 1346.4189999999999
I don't see the point in it right now oh

1344.769 --> 1349.769
and by the way that's interesting

1346.419 --> 1355.95
conspiracy cat seeing a natural movement

1349.769 --> 1360.789
so how about the unnatural claim that

1355.95 --> 1365.019
the visuals of the horizon is heavily

1360.789 --> 1367.35
displaced beyond the geometric horizon

1365.019 --> 1370.509
which would be the literal position

1367.35 --> 1378.61
coordinate wise right so talk about

1370.509 --> 1381.22
unnatural isn't that very unnatural that

1378.61 --> 1383.9499999999998
you assume something is there even

1381.22 --> 1387.549
though you can't see it to be there but

1383.95 --> 1390.1290000000001
you claim that you can see it ever

1387.549 --> 1394.059
only in theoretical circumstances that

1390.129 --> 1395.4989999999998
will not be possible now that is kind of

1394.059 --> 1398.83
relying on something supernatural

1395.499 --> 1405.3890000000001
because it is yeah

1398.83 --> 1405.389
you can't really physically prove that

1405.69 --> 1410.8500000000001
yeah well understood is it is it really

1410.879 --> 1415.629
but which refraction is well understood

1413.559 --> 1419.1689999999999
because if you're talking about actual

1415.629 --> 1422.32
refraction oh sure but I don't think

1419.169 --> 1425.44
that's the refraction that that is

1422.32 --> 1427.72
required to to make the horizon loom

1425.44 --> 1432.0700000000002
over the horizon which is technically

1427.72 --> 1435.429
impossible because the horizon can never

1432.07 --> 1438.149
be displaced by any mirages in effects

1435.429 --> 1438.1490000000001
transpiring

1464.83 --> 1470.32
why should be okay well hey I think this

1468.519 --> 1472.45
is probably a genuine question you know

1470.32 --> 1475.84
conspiracy cats doesn't watch flat earth

1472.45 --> 1480.22
debates probably because he can handle

1475.84 --> 1483.07
it the the rawness of it but why should

1480.22 --> 1487.1200000000001
the horizon be immune to refraction well

1483.07 --> 1490.4189999999999
because of what the horizon is it is an

1487.12 --> 1494.4699999999998
optical effect and any refraction that

1490.419 --> 1496.69
happens the only way to even identify

1494.47 --> 1501.1000000000001
the type of refraction and happening

1496.69 --> 1505.659
it's because it always relates to the

1501.1 --> 1510.37
horizon and that horizon effectively is

1505.659 --> 1512.529
always in the same spot it is at the

1510.37 --> 1515.9189999999999
same height it is always it's never

1512.529 --> 1521.26
going to be warm no that's never it's

1515.919 --> 1524.289
never like multiple degrees of angles

1521.26 --> 1526.35
off that never happens ever there's no

1524.289 --> 1531.34
proof of that

1526.35 --> 1535.059
objects can appear to make curves at the

1531.34 --> 1538.299
horizon due to refraction effects but

1535.059 --> 1541.99
the horizon itself is never part of that

1538.299 --> 1546.34
refraction objects can refract like

1541.99 --> 1550.1200000000001
bendiness horizon doesn't the horizon is

1546.34 --> 1553.899
always where it is which is up until the

1550.12 --> 1556.779
point where sights is cut off due to

1553.899 --> 1560.3799999999999
actual refraction the blurring of the

1556.779 --> 1564.309
gray soup at the back where the sight

1560.38 --> 1566.5800000000002
can no longer distinguish yea separate

1564.309 --> 1566.58
things

1571.549 --> 1576.08
so yeah that's the reason why

1587.24 --> 1589.8700000000001
right

1617.019 --> 1621.729
conspiracy cats oh you want to talk

1619.85 --> 1624.4089999999999
about the wound again

1621.729 --> 1627.159
be careful not to turn into a lunatic

1624.409 --> 1629.96
because the moon can drive people nuts

1627.159 --> 1634.3690000000001
because it is such a weird phenomena

1629.96 --> 1634.8790000000001
right so yeah those supposed shadows on

1634.369 --> 1637.4189999999999
the moon

1634.879 --> 1639.649
yeah they very much seem like shadows

1637.419 --> 1642.47
but what is it really

1639.649 --> 1646.129
now it's the absence of light in a very

1642.47 --> 1649.849
specific pattern and that pattern can

1646.129 --> 1653.83
easily be mistaken as some kind of

1649.849 --> 1658.46
shadow play over a surface over a

1653.83 --> 1661.97
surface with holes in it but yeah if you

1658.46 --> 1664.1290000000001
regard that view another in a more

1661.97 --> 1670.609
geometrical sense you may figure out

1664.129 --> 1675.4089999999999
that it seems to be a yeah a eith

1670.609 --> 1679.9089999999999
fractal-like pattern it's all fractal

1675.409 --> 1683.1190000000001
like pattern and that the shadow the

1679.909 --> 1685.6390000000001
apparent shadow play reviews this but

1683.119 --> 1688.6999999999998
the whole thing is still just a light

1685.639 --> 1693.83
based apparition the ripples in the moon

1688.7 --> 1697.909
one thing and just the yeah the there

1693.83 --> 1699.59
really the non shadow nonsensical where

1697.909 --> 1702.44
is it the terminator line of this

1699.59 --> 1704.9889999999998
supposed shadow on the moon none of that

1702.44 --> 1708.499
makes any sense like that that would

1704.989 --> 1710.599
work that way that is the shadow line

1708.499 --> 1714.289
would have be a terminator line like

1710.599 --> 1717.649
that if it was actually a sphere and any

1714.289 --> 1721.07
kind of animations right where there is

1717.649 --> 1724.4289999999999
a a lights very far away and then you

1721.07 --> 1727.389
have the moon and all that it just

1724.429 --> 1730.8490000000002
doesn't really look like that

1727.389 --> 1735.9789999999998
it's not how shadow play works on a

1730.849 --> 1737.809
sphere you know if if you would just

1735.979 --> 1738.95
look at the moon and how the shadow is

1737.809 --> 1741.229
and how the whole light on the whole

1738.95 --> 1744.6490000000001
thing is it seems much more like you're

1741.229 --> 1749.0
looking at it a disc with curved edges

1744.649 --> 1752.4499999999998
and there's just a thing moving over it

1749.0 --> 1755.33
that's covering it up like it's a disc

1752.45 --> 1756.89
of light and something is cooperating it

1755.33 --> 1760.8999999999999
out but that's much more what it looks

1756.89 --> 1760.9
like to me not really like a sphere

1762.13 --> 1766.8700000000001
because it doesn't really look spherical

1764.6 --> 1766.87
to me

1811.75 --> 1815.669
is this some random guy here

1844.56 --> 1851.61
yeah good servant it's absolutely no use

1848.3 --> 1853.61
telling any any baller that to their

1851.61 --> 1860.28
face ever

1853.61 --> 1862.1999999999998
you know first off fundamentally they

1860.28 --> 1864.69
don't even believe in it and when you

1862.2 --> 1867.93
say those type of things to a ballers

1864.69 --> 1871.5
face they're only gonna take you as a

1867.93 --> 1873.45
religious zealot and technically in a

1871.5 --> 1876.84
small way they're kind of curl in the

1873.45 --> 1881.25
right in that one moment because you're

1876.84 --> 1884.6699999999998
it's like no use it's pearls before

1881.25 --> 1891.78
swine's literally and you're wasting the

1884.67 --> 1894.27
pearls you shouldn't do that unless you

1891.78 --> 1896.78
want to pick a fight but I don't really

1894.27 --> 1900.81
want to pick a fight here in this chat

1896.78 --> 1902.82
like that you know they'll just end up

1900.81 --> 1905.6
ballers getting banned again and then

1902.82 --> 1912.9299999999998
them complaining about it everywhere

1905.6 --> 1917.1
they want that if they're gonna get

1912.93 --> 1920.6000000000001
bandits because whatever bad behavior

1917.1 --> 1920.6
just purely came from them

1925.31 --> 1933.84
don't me but you know what it mean right

1930.36 --> 1936.74
goodsoon it's really no use telling and

1933.84 --> 1936.74
saying something like that

1950.41 --> 1957.4
that's right Missouri bear yeah there's

1954.04 --> 1958.78
a lot of people just conveniently like

1957.4 --> 1961.1200000000001
two on the baller so I'd like to

1958.78 --> 1962.47
overlook that like yeah how does that

1961.12 --> 1964.53
actually look like that

1962.47 --> 1967.27
and then there there you go again

1964.53 --> 1972.76
remember how this works right so just

1967.27 --> 1975.4
because just like how the earth has to

1972.76 --> 1977.89
be a sphere but look flat and then they

1975.4 --> 1982.72
imagine their terrestrial refraction to

1977.89 --> 1986.23
bend that flat plane into a sphere but

1982.72 --> 1988.48
you can't see that like that machination

1986.23 --> 1991.45
on optics right well because you have

1988.48 --> 1993.48
the same process when you try to emulate

1991.45 --> 1996.52
some kind of moon situation with light

1993.48 --> 1999.01
because it it's the same result

1996.52 --> 2001.8899999999999
like it doesn't look like that that's

1999.01 --> 2003.93
why they then have to imagine some kind

2001.89 --> 2008.5800000000002
of other optical effect that it would

2003.93 --> 2012.5700000000002
explain why it doesn't look like well

2008.58 --> 2015.57
when you have a ball and a lamp you know

2012.57 --> 2018.0
then they have to explain all that and

2015.57 --> 2022.6499999999999
then they have to explain why an eclipse

2018.0 --> 2024.57
shadow is so supposedly small like how

2022.65 --> 2026.5500000000002
that shadow plate doesn't really match

2024.57 --> 2030.45
any conception of the moon being a

2026.55 --> 2031.11
larger object and all that that's how it

2030.45 --> 2033.39
works

2031.11 --> 2035.76
so yeah you can look at it and then

2033.39 --> 2039.15
think it is kind of like a ball that

2035.76 --> 2041.8799999999999
light is casting a shadow from but when

2039.15 --> 2044.25
you actually compare it to doing that

2041.88 --> 2045.8400000000001
setup that physical setup in the real

2044.25 --> 2049.879
world you'll find that it actually

2045.84 --> 2054.389
doesn't look like that at all and that

2049.879 --> 2059.0699999999997
kind of thing can yeah can drive people

2054.389 --> 2063.6
crazy so I think because with the moon

2059.07 --> 2065.61
it's very very upfront very close you

2063.6 --> 2069.69
don't necessarily even need any kind of

2065.61 --> 2073.26
telescope to see what that yeah how that

2069.69 --> 2075.44
roughly looks can be very confusing to

2073.26 --> 2075.44
people

2076.49 --> 2088.1589999999997
I bet you that in the very very old days

2084.399 --> 2091.31
if ya some kind of weird Helius early

2088.159 --> 2094.429
hylia centrist would be telling I don't

2091.31 --> 2097.5499999999997
know tribes or whatever somewhere in

2094.429 --> 2099.89
South America and that's something like

2097.55 --> 2102.5890000000004
that that they would be telling like

2099.89 --> 2105.29
yeah that moon over there is actually a

2102.589 --> 2108.619
freaking rock spinning around us a ball

2105.29 --> 2112.46
I think they would freak out like really

2108.619 --> 2114.38
bad they would just get nightmares from

2112.46 --> 2117.589
that [ __ ] and then it didn't make sense

2114.38 --> 2120.589
and it would they would yeah

2117.589 --> 2124.43
turn into lunatics they would start to

2120.589 --> 2128.0299999999997
fear the moon I don't know maybe maybe

2124.43 --> 2130.2799999999997
that's just me but I think that probably

2128.03 --> 2134.1800000000003
did happen like really early on when

2130.28 --> 2136.46
they tried to yeah spread that idea for

2134.18 --> 2139.8799999999997
the very first time in some kind of

2136.46 --> 2142.67
final system and not just loose stories

2139.88 --> 2144.77
tied together you know when they really

2142.67 --> 2149.96
booted up the heliocentrism which should

2144.77 --> 2152.08
be like ages and ages ago very long time

2149.96 --> 2152.08
ago

2155.35 --> 2162.0099999999998
oh cool man do thank you for $10 super

2159.01 --> 2164.3500000000004
chat donation hey I get to watch your

2162.01 --> 2166.3300000000004
entire show today are we and happy

2164.35 --> 2169.42
Friday to me I'm blessed

2166.33 --> 2171.63
thank you very much it was good to have

2169.42 --> 2171.63
you

2176.02 --> 2179.099
[Music]

2202.9 --> 2205.529
hmm

2206.72 --> 2216.95
I was wish I could just get you guys on

2211.49 --> 2218.8689999999997
on a panel or something because it this

2216.95 --> 2222.83
is kind of an interesting discussion I

2218.869 --> 2227.7400000000002
think about the moon and conspiracy cat

2222.83 --> 2227.74
seems to have a lot of trouble with it

2280.93 --> 2283.74
hmm

2298.02 --> 2308.34
the this really concerns because we know

2304.86 --> 2315.25
that no other shape then a globe

2308.34 --> 2317.0
explains all our observations sounds 3d

2315.25 --> 2320.49
[Music]

2317.0 --> 2322.17
just know that that is like a pre

2320.49 --> 2323.8799999999997
assumption that's kind of already been

2322.17 --> 2326.46
disproven before that even started

2323.88 --> 2328.7400000000002
because we already discussed how what

2326.46 --> 2329.45
we're seeing doesn't really match a

2328.74 --> 2333.0
globe

2329.45 --> 2335.24
sounds like doubling down conspiracy

2333.0 --> 2335.24
cats

2340.5 --> 2349.95
so oh right so now we need to tell you

2343.67 --> 2354.14
why the supposed presupposed balls in

2349.95 --> 2354.14
the sky don't actually look like balls

2355.94 --> 2364.41
so we have to explain it to you why it

2359.7 --> 2366.75
doesn't look like a ball now we're not

2364.41 --> 2370.71
really concerned with why it doesn't

2366.75 --> 2373.04
look like a ball we just like to point

2370.71 --> 2377.43
out it doesn't look like a ball

2373.04 --> 2379.56
not really you yeah you can sloppily

2377.43 --> 2381.81
imagine it to look like a ball well

2379.56 --> 2387.0299999999997
again if you compare it to any kind of

2381.81 --> 2389.34
physical ball and the lights do whatever

2387.03 --> 2402.6200000000003
with it it's not gonna look like that

2389.34 --> 2406.02
moon so yeah a ball does absolutely not

2402.62 --> 2409.79
explain everything because not

2406.02 --> 2409.79
everything looks like a ball

2446.79 --> 2453.43
that's hilarious

2449.73 --> 2457.2400000000002
the moon should have a hotspot wide why

2453.43 --> 2461.3799999999997
why is that well maybe because it is in

2457.24 --> 2465.85
suppo pre supposedly a sphere right it's

2461.38 --> 2468.9100000000003
a sphere and then a sphere surface has

2465.85 --> 2472.66
different types of angles to light and

2468.91 --> 2475.81
so the amount of light that's reflecting

2472.66 --> 2480.0099999999998
of that sphere is going to gradiate the

2475.81 --> 2482.74
further away from the perpendicular the

2480.01 --> 2485.2900000000004
straight point of that sphere towards

2482.74 --> 2488.4399999999996
the light source for the gradients away

2485.29 --> 2491.98
the weaker it becomes that's what

2488.44 --> 2496.93
happens so it doesn't just have this

2491.98 --> 2500.85
border that just moves sharply with the

2496.93 --> 2500.85
like that blood power that works

2507.65 --> 2514.94
oh hey if you could show something that

2511.61 --> 2520.48
isn't with an actual sphere a provable

2514.94 --> 2520.48
ball you know conspiracy cats

2526.92 --> 2532.44
all right and oh by the way you don't

2530.04 --> 2535.17
have to use any kind of laser light for

2532.44 --> 2544.02
that hey what are you doing what are you

2535.17 --> 2553.65
doing George Sanford I'm in the middle

2544.02 --> 2555.5099999999998
of a discussion with him just because he

2553.65 --> 2559.1600000000003
says something really dumb is not a good

2555.51 --> 2559.1600000000003
reason for him to be timed out I

2561.29 --> 2572.4
actually would have preferred if that

2563.549 --> 2574.319
would just have shown in my chat now I

2572.4 --> 2576.109
doesn't need any time to think it's in

2574.319 --> 2579.329
their work

2576.109 --> 2581.869
look George that's not what the wrench

2579.329 --> 2581.869
is for

2599.26 --> 2606.8
yeah you don't need to tell me that he

2601.97 --> 2609.4399999999996
haven't but yeah I don't see why you did

2606.8 --> 2612.26
that it's like completely unnecessary

2609.44 --> 2614.41
that's not yeah don't do that again

2612.26 --> 2621.1400000000003
please

2614.41 --> 2622.79
good because yeah it was kind of engaged

2621.14 --> 2624.95
with him in a conversation even though

2622.79 --> 2626.48
he constantly was just responding to you

2624.95 --> 2633.14
I saw that

2626.48 --> 2643.04
oh yeah yeah but this is his other

2633.14 --> 2646.1299999999997
account he didn't have the patience but

2643.04 --> 2650.47
yeah yeah he claimed earlier that it

2646.13 --> 2657.07
always looks like a ball right and like

2650.47 --> 2660.6499999999996
what did he say again do we see a speck

2657.07 --> 2667.88
specular highlight on all spheres on

2660.65 --> 2669.5
earth and yeah pretty much yes unless

2667.88 --> 2674.9500000000003
you're gonna use some kind of laser

2669.5 --> 2674.95
light I guess then it might be different

2678.21 --> 2684.03
and that there are different types of

2680.49 --> 2685.859
lamps though but I think that they're

2684.03 --> 2687.8390000000004
usually on the sphere there's always

2685.859 --> 2690.14
going to be some kind of gray in effect

2687.839 --> 2692.94
to the light there's going to be just a

2690.14 --> 2694.65
gradient transition that that's typical

2692.94 --> 2700.9500000000003
of spheres it's even how I personally

2694.65 --> 2703.32
learn how to draw spheres take a circle

2700.95 --> 2705.75
and then you gradiate the light and

2703.32 --> 2709.77
shadow play and that's how it becomes

2705.75 --> 2713.13
very much looking like a sphere that's

2709.77 --> 2717.15
how it is gonna look like it's fair you

2713.13 --> 2719.58
know now if I just try to draw a moon

2717.15 --> 2721.109
and then use those patterns well the

2719.58 --> 2724.56
funny thing is if I did a really good

2721.109 --> 2726.93
job it would look like a moon not a

2724.56 --> 2729.9
sphere it would just look like the moon

2726.93 --> 2732.589
how the moon looks not that's fair it's

2729.9 --> 2732.589
a different look

2752.42 --> 2755.89
what's going on here

2758.13 --> 2766.289
oh right we have well yeah you can be

2762.869 --> 2770.609
very complaining about us telling that

2766.289 --> 2774.6600000000003
other people ballers lie but we don't

2770.609 --> 2783.5589999999997
just randomly say that kind of [ __ ] we

2774.66 --> 2789.109
usually do it yeah we usually do that

2783.559 --> 2794.19
when we literally catch people lying and

2789.109 --> 2798.21
that happens more than often so if you

2794.19 --> 2802.589
don't like that then maybe you shouldn't

2798.21 --> 2806.309
associate with people that do that or at

2802.589 --> 2810.259
least don't feel like it's your group

2806.309 --> 2814.559
and you're being addressed as a liar

2810.259 --> 2816.809
because other people supposedly on your

2814.559 --> 2819.3900000000003
side of the argument are lying at times

2816.809 --> 2826.2000000000003
then why even bring that up why are you

2819.39 --> 2828.839
being so complaining about it and even

2826.2 --> 2834.1499999999996
if if somebody in chat here mentioned

2828.839 --> 2837.869
something about lies why would you just

2834.15 --> 2842.989
assume it's about you if if you're if

2837.869 --> 2842.989
you have no guilty conscience that is no

2843.079 --> 2847.549
unless they just straight-out tell you

2847.609 --> 2852.719
but there's a lot of ballers that

2850.13 --> 2857.2490000000003
especially trolls that do that to me all

2852.719 --> 2860.009
the time and worse but do I then yeah

2857.249 --> 2862.14
get out of my way to get all pissy

2860.009 --> 2871.13
towards them no because they're

2862.14 --> 2871.1299999999997
despicable and yeah what uses that No

2885.18 --> 2894.18
okay and I get it nobody likes to be

2888.15 --> 2897.27
called a [ __ ] so I think I just

2894.18 --> 2901.16
tightened about Aqaba for the wrong way

2897.27 --> 2901.16
I think I misread what you said

2902.089 --> 2912.869
yeah Missouri bear gets a little rough

2906.299 --> 2917.9
in the language Missouri bear calm it

2912.869 --> 2917.9
down you always get so heated up

2920.07 --> 2923.179
[Music]

2930.12 --> 2939.13
diffuse reflection what yeah I know but

2936.37 --> 2941.37
Missouri bear that's because he is a

2939.13 --> 2945.19
baller

2941.37 --> 2948.58
that's not a [ __ ] that is a mechanism

2945.19 --> 2952.9
it's like a religious handicap that he

2948.58 --> 2957.61
cannot get rid of and just yeah it's not

2952.9 --> 2960.7000000000003
like absolute more moronic Ness because

2957.61 --> 2963.73
he has no choice he cannot be made to

2960.7 --> 2965.98
understand it that doesn't make him a

2963.73 --> 2969.52
[ __ ] that makes him a religious zealot

2965.98 --> 2972.58
and there's a lot of that and all of the

2969.52 --> 2974.98
ballers and sometimes they got a duck

2972.58 --> 2976.66
yeah very dug down deep and they can

2974.98 --> 2979.93
keep it to themselves for a very very

2976.66 --> 2982.69
long time but if they wouldn't have that

2979.93 --> 2987.7599999999998
then they would not be ballers because

2982.69 --> 2991.66
that is intricately interests interests

2987.76 --> 2996.7000000000003
I left intrinsically linked through the

2991.66 --> 2999.97
baller religion there are things that

2996.7 --> 3004.22
are must be systematically overlooked by

2999.97 --> 3008.0
habit in order to achieve the vision of

3004.22 --> 3008.0
the bow of the globe

3016.73 --> 3027.14
yeah but I get it you know I Missouri

3021.589 --> 3029.27
bear it's just I guess it's kind of

3027.14 --> 3032.18
tough you know there's different types

3029.27 --> 3035.99
of chats with different types of ballers

3032.18 --> 3038.0299999999997
and you yeah I don't know maybe some of

3035.99 --> 3041.24
you just don't care you know but I do

3038.03 --> 3043.25
care about this it really matters how

3041.24 --> 3045.95
you're gonna address certain level of

3043.25 --> 3047.78
ballers now there's some ballers out

3045.95 --> 3051.859
there that are so nasty and disgusting

3047.78 --> 3054.65
and just beyond like psychopathic levels

3051.859 --> 3057.5299999999997
of disgusting and they don't even

3054.65 --> 3060.7400000000002
realize it now if you're going to just

3057.53 --> 3063.98
call them morons and like get creative

3060.74 --> 3065.6299999999997
you know in your descriptions I yeah

3063.98 --> 3068.089
there's no problem with that except yeah

3065.63 --> 3072.26
they're gonna start poking you then

3068.089 --> 3074.7799999999997
usually but yeah there's a lot of

3072.26 --> 3078.5890000000004
ballers that are not like that at all

3074.78 --> 3082.13
and they sometimes can almost like

3078.589 --> 3087.22
parent certain levels of machination and

3082.13 --> 3087.2200000000003
even be a little devious at times but

3087.28 --> 3095.5690000000004
they often don't really see it like that

3091.91 --> 3098.089
even so it's not like they're really

3095.569 --> 3101.47
trying to take control of reality

3098.089 --> 3108.17
they're just inserting what they think

3101.47 --> 3110.2099999999996
is kind of right it's difficult so I try

3108.17 --> 3112.04
to read into the the feeling and the

3110.21 --> 3115.16
intention a lot more than whether

3112.04 --> 3117.14
something is even correct because

3115.16 --> 3120.6499999999996
sometimes like the feelings can handle

3117.14 --> 3122.66
it and then you'll switch in your mind

3120.65 --> 3129.44
the the train of thought you're gonna

3122.66 --> 3133.66
pursue and then you start yeah red

3129.44 --> 3136.88
herring or a certain so something stupid

3133.66 --> 3140.1499999999996
that doesn't necessarily even make you

3136.88 --> 3142.73
stupid it only makes you stupid

3140.15 --> 3146.96
if you really will double down on it

3142.73 --> 3149.62
forever like really badly and like under

3146.96 --> 3151.69
just straight-out questioning

3149.62 --> 3155.8599999999997
still asserted then it's good then it

3151.69 --> 3160.35
gets bad but I think that most people

3155.86 --> 3164.85
both ballers here in chat don't do that

3160.35 --> 3168.19
or they at least they try not to so I

3164.85 --> 3170.38
would hope that the flat earthers in my

3168.19 --> 3173.02
chat and they really do appreciate them

3170.38 --> 3177.6400000000003
of course that they try to be more

3173.02 --> 3187.69
careful it's like it's a it's a mixed

3177.64 --> 3192.8199999999997
crowd and yeah like these ballers at

3187.69 --> 3194.38
least are trying to do their best so try

3192.82 --> 3196.42
to be a little bit more careful with

3194.38 --> 3200.83
them sometimes and hey if they really

3196.42 --> 3201.48
don't go too far then I'll spot them you

3200.83 --> 3205.12
know

3201.48 --> 3208.09
then I'll spot them quickly what I need

3205.12 --> 3210.79
assistance rent wise for mostly is

3208.09 --> 3214.06
really like when there's like trolls

3210.79 --> 3214.5099999999998
spamming sock account [ __ ] and perverted

3214.06 --> 3217.2599999999998
[ __ ]

3214.51 --> 3220.26
like very clearly you know when that is

3217.26 --> 3220.26
No

3224.64 --> 3229.39
yeah see how my welcome back sorry I

3227.259 --> 3234.94
kind of accidentally timed you out I

3229.39 --> 3238.739
misread what you said please don't get

3234.94 --> 3238.739
all up so and excited about it

3245.98 --> 3251.15
[Music]

3247.1 --> 3251.15
yeah that's just what I said

3253.52 --> 3257.7599999999998
you might have also noticed by the way

3256.2 --> 3261.21
unless you just stepped away or

3257.76 --> 3265.4900000000002
something that I proceeded to actually

3261.21 --> 3265.4900000000002
address that person that called you that

3265.88 --> 3273.57
so that why habit that that happens

3271.65 --> 3277.53
sometimes sometimes I'll read something

3273.57 --> 3280.11
and they then I miss contextualize it

3277.53 --> 3284.15
and it can be very impulsive especially

3280.11 --> 3287.88
when I see ballers do that you know I

3284.15 --> 3291.69
can't really well yeah I guess that and

3287.88 --> 3294.03
maybe it's not really a super Oh 50/50

3291.69 --> 3297.08
on the situation with it but I'll be

3294.03 --> 3299.88
more inclined to let flat earthers

3297.08 --> 3301.59
use a little bit more rough language at

3299.88 --> 3303.4500000000003
times although I don't really appreciate

3301.59 --> 3304.98
it when they do and I will definitely

3303.45 --> 3308.43
stop them when they're starting to go

3304.98 --> 3310.29
really too far but on average I am a

3308.43 --> 3318.18
little bit more strict when it comes to

3310.29 --> 3320.7599999999998
ballers it's true so if I see even them

3318.18 --> 3323.58
complaining about Flat Earth or calling

3320.76 --> 3327.57
you [ __ ] or whatever then instinctively

3323.58 --> 3329.88
there's sometimes a chance that I will

3327.57 --> 3331.9500000000003
think it's literally you saying that to

3329.88 --> 3333.81
aggravate it's something that's going on

3331.95 --> 3336.0899999999997
and then I'll time you out and that's

3333.81 --> 3338.61
exactly what happened and then I read it

3336.09 --> 3341.28
again I thought wait you were actually

3338.61 --> 3343.6400000000003
complaining about it oops yeah that

3341.28 --> 3343.6400000000003
happens

3366.86 --> 3378.29
yeah okay have a well I read the word

3373.79 --> 3390.11
[ __ ] so I just thought you know that's

3378.29 --> 3392.36
what they explained it look okay well if

3390.11 --> 3396.2200000000003
you say that you're that tidy on your

3392.36 --> 3396.2200000000003
words I try to keep that in mind

3416.46 --> 3425.43
yep moon is a mystery well the entire

3422.4 --> 3430.85
celestial bodies you know the Sun to me

3425.43 --> 3434.52
is the greatest mystery of all like it

3430.85 --> 3438.36
yeah when you really yeah start to

3434.52 --> 3441.06
realize also what my conceptions of the

3438.36 --> 3444.06
realm have led to then it's just like

3441.06 --> 3446.91
the most insane mystery ever like what

3444.06 --> 3448.98
is the Sun like it doesn't seem to be a

3446.91 --> 3451.41
physical object it seems to be like the

3448.98 --> 3453.36
moon on a graphic in nature yet there's

3451.41 --> 3457.98
this incredible amount of light coming

3453.36 --> 3462.02
from there even though it's personal so

3457.98 --> 3464.82
there is light that's like not even

3462.02 --> 3467.28
literally some object it's just light

3464.82 --> 3470.61
that's manifesting personal and it's

3467.28 --> 3473.6400000000003
feeding everything it's determining so

3470.61 --> 3475.8
much of what's going on in the world has

3473.64 --> 3478.2599999999998
a direct influence on the spirit and on

3475.8 --> 3480.8100000000004
the condition of life and so much

3478.26 --> 3482.46
it's everything yet it's not even even

3480.81 --> 3486.87
seem to be coming from some kind of

3482.46 --> 3490.05
physical object like what is this why

3486.87 --> 3498.5699999999997
does it do people see different Sun

3490.05 --> 3503.7000000000003
shadows like again this this potential

3498.57 --> 3504.65
bizarre situation that starts out when

3503.7 --> 3508.41
you realize that

3504.65 --> 3511.29
crepuscular rays rays coming through

3508.41 --> 3514.6499999999996
clouds from the Sun they're not only

3511.29 --> 3517.17
like spreading out as if the Sun were

3514.65 --> 3520.8
very close that it isn't it's just that

3517.17 --> 3522.66
location from the angular location from

3520.8 --> 3524.76
the Sun and it's emanating from that

3522.66 --> 3528.8399999999997
because it's so holographic how you can

3524.76 --> 3530.76
see that hit the ground like beams

3528.84 --> 3533.19
hitting the ground and then from another

3530.76 --> 3535.17
location a bit further away you look

3533.19 --> 3537.7200000000003
there and there's no beams hitting that

3535.17 --> 3543.54
ground at all like the person could

3537.72 --> 3545.97
literally be quickly like outlining the

3543.54 --> 3547.64
beams on the ground like drawing circles

3545.97 --> 3550.16
around it quickly if the

3547.64 --> 3552.41
if the clouds weren't moving right and

3550.16 --> 3554.239
then the other person would be looking

3552.41 --> 3557.299
there it's like no there is no beam of

3554.239 --> 3559.88
light hitting that yeah so I try to

3557.299 --> 3562.999
freaking explain that with light coming

3559.88 --> 3569.63
from a physical object you know makes

3562.999 --> 3573.9199999999996
very little sense so that's a starter

3569.63 --> 3576.259
and then if you could manage to somehow

3573.92 --> 3578.1800000000003
have a light of sight at incredible

3576.259 --> 3580.64
distances like if somebody was standing

3578.18 --> 3583.519
on a mountain very fair clear day you

3580.64 --> 3585.859
can see somebody like a hundred miles

3583.519 --> 3588.019
away and if it was clear enough that you

3585.859 --> 3591.259
could actually see their silhouette and

3588.019 --> 3594.109
a shadow you would have to overcome the

3591.259 --> 3595.88
diffraction or the concealment that's

3594.109 --> 3598.369
why you have to be standing very high up

3595.88 --> 3601.539
on the mountain and then that person

3598.369 --> 3604.609
would in a certain time they have Sun

3601.539 --> 3607.67
coming from a certain angle certain

3604.609 --> 3610.0389999999998
shadow direction from their perspective

3607.67 --> 3612.6800000000003
then the person on the mountain takes

3610.039 --> 3616.19
their telescope or whatever aims it at

3612.68 --> 3619.219
the first person and yeah the shadow is

3616.19 --> 3621.44
not going to be at the same spot it's

3619.219 --> 3623.289
not going to go the same direction for

3621.44 --> 3626.9
the viewer through the telescope because

3623.289 --> 3635.3900000000003
in their position the Sun is at a

3626.9 --> 3639.4100000000003
different angle right so it's just not

3635.39 --> 3644.589
gonna match exactly all of this combined

3639.41 --> 3647.42
is just like okay how can the prime

3644.589 --> 3650.319
light source that does it seems to be

3647.42 --> 3652.94
non-local in some way how can that feed

3650.319 --> 3658.67
pretty much all the processes that are

3652.94 --> 3662.14
happening everything a non-local light

3658.67 --> 3662.14
it's it's baffling

3666.44 --> 3669.55
[Music]

3679.95 --> 3684.96
right anyway I'm gonna round out the

3681.78 --> 3686.1600000000003
show because it's already 3 o'clock I

3684.96 --> 3687.75
hope you guys liked it

3686.16 --> 3690.6
start it up a little slow again because

3687.75 --> 3692.79
of temperature I hope be a little bit

3690.6 --> 3695.61
more active next time on the Saturday

3692.79 --> 3697.62
show tomorrow anyway if it's not gonna

3695.61 --> 3699.48
start out like that it's a longer show

3697.62 --> 3703.29
so probably get more active the second

3699.48 --> 3704.64
half I usually do anyway if you like to

3703.29 --> 3706.23
show them please don't forget the

3704.64 --> 3707.8199999999997
Rogen's it up and if you haven't already

Amsterdam time every day and please also

3714.66 --> 3720.45
do support me through the paypal patreon

guys if you can and thanks for the super

3735.54 --> 3740.18
chance of course right so I'll be back

3737.76 --> 3742.44
tomorrow a flat earther leeward number

3740.18 --> 3744.3199999999997
547 and I'm going to join the Flat Earth

3742.44 --> 3748.38
debates which have already started up

3744.32 --> 3754.2200000000003
see hashtag meifa indeed over mu cool

3748.38 --> 3754.2200000000003
and until the next video keep it flat

3754.61 --> 3777.55
[Music]

3780.17 --> 3782.23
you
