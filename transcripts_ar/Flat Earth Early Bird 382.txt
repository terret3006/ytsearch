[Music]

32.21 --> 34.27
you

42.21 --> 44.27
you

44.69 --> 51.899
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

48.719 --> 53.85
early-bird number 382 I'm your host

51.899 --> 55.5
Arwen and before we start to show please

53.85 --> 57.449

60.87 --> 64.53
I'm going live just normally 2:00 p.m.

62.85 --> 67.32000000000001
Amsterdam time every day

64.53 --> 69.0
please also do support me and my channel

67.32 --> 73.78999999999999
through the paypal patreon my GoFundMe

69.0 --> 75.54
and the super chats much appreciated so

73.79 --> 81.36000000000001
welcome everyone

75.54 --> 85.5
sunny afternoon here the weather is no

81.36 --> 88.679
it's bit of blue sky but also

85.5 --> 95.55
interesting clouds sometimes a little

88.679 --> 102.36
Sun sometimes a little ring not really

95.55 --> 107.0
cold it's an interesting day see now the

102.36 --> 107.0
Sun comes out really nice and bright

108.59 --> 111.28
right

114.74 --> 124.78999999999999
so today I have with me tea and a banana

121.06 --> 130.369
from yesterday which is gonna be my

124.79 --> 137.14000000000001
breakfast practically so let's see who

130.369 --> 143.45
is in chat yes Steve was first an ATM

137.14 --> 152.58999999999997
requiem dream Daniel laughs a VA they

143.45 --> 152.58999999999997
like Ohio and then you Robin Stanley

152.86 --> 160.87
good servant Ragnar Stefan Harrison

156.95 --> 160.86999999999998
yeah good to see you all

170.25 --> 187.6
right so yesterday I had a really good

183.79 --> 189.54999999999998
dinner finally got myself to bake make a

187.6 --> 192.04
big meal that I've been postponing for

189.55 --> 196.29000000000002
like two weeks but it really hit the

192.04 --> 200.35
spot with a lot of red peppers and I

196.29 --> 203.44
forgot like how much that helps like the

200.35 --> 209.79999999999998
blood flow so it was really I really was

203.44 --> 211.75
really nice in the cold to have that and

209.8 --> 212.29000000000002
I should probably have done that like a

211.75 --> 219.07
week ago

212.29 --> 224.60999999999999
oh well other than that I don't know I

219.07 --> 224.60999999999999
thought yes there was a bit quiet

227.03 --> 230.38
concerning Flat Earth

237.099 --> 246.099
except for yeah I watched it Jason dis

241.719 --> 248.98
dis berry family globe light tour stuff

246.099 --> 251.349
as they went on a boat that was pretty

248.98 --> 253.98899999999998
cool I thought that boat it was really

251.349 --> 255.76
big and it almost felt as big as the

253.989 --> 259.18
conference room in Amsterdam although

255.76 --> 262.479
that is not as fast of course multiple

259.18 --> 265.539
layers stories open but I just thought

262.479 --> 270.849
like yeah that's that would be kind of

265.539 --> 273.07
cool potentially to have a small flat

270.849 --> 275.02
earth conference or something on that

273.07 --> 278.77
boat while it's just going back and

275.02 --> 279.639
forth but I don't know might be a huge

278.77 --> 281.68
hassle

279.639 --> 284.169
I don't know how expensive the food

281.68 --> 292.72
there is and all that so and if it the

284.169 --> 296.71
quality so it was just an idea I think

292.72 --> 301.889
in general almost like a flat earth

296.71 --> 301.88899999999995
cruise would be a very cool idea

303.689 --> 309.869
would be expensive that kind of [ __ ]

305.939 --> 315.139
though but anyway yeah that was that was

309.869 --> 320.55
kind of cool yeah other than that I

315.139 --> 324.229
honed Benjamin on D life watch that the

320.55 --> 324.229
most interesting as usual

327.719 --> 332.179
oh yeah did the chitchat

333.06 --> 339.42
with her Auntie was it up against was

336.24 --> 340.95
its first chemo I think and he went

339.42 --> 343.98
totally out of control

340.95 --> 345.75
yeah man I'm just remembering all didn't

343.98 --> 351.72
know it wasn't that boring yesterday at

345.75 --> 359.31
all I think that I just had a really

351.72 --> 363.0
good night's sleep and mentally they

359.31 --> 364.71
moved some space in between and of

363.0 --> 367.61
course yeah there was little premiere

364.71 --> 367.60999999999996
from quantum eraser

379.599 --> 382.289
huh

390.199 --> 399.68
right well yeah they lie oh hi it is

394.62 --> 403.319
funny that you mention it because I made

399.68 --> 406.16
chili sin carne you have to make it with

403.319 --> 412.52000000000004
now just replace it with carrots to me

406.16 --> 417.3
where it's fine so much of it but oh

412.52 --> 421.25899999999996
yeah garlic I chose like not really the

417.3 --> 425.07
standard dried clothes this time but it

421.259 --> 427.02000000000004
had a somewhat having laid around one of

425.07 --> 428.58
those fresh cloves where it's still all

427.02 --> 431.639
the leaves are on it and everything

428.58 --> 435.75
and I used that thing and that's like

431.639 --> 438.99
crispy fresh garlic like very super

435.75 --> 442.07
crispy fresh and I use that for it and

438.99 --> 446.419
wow it is a lot better type of garlic

442.07 --> 446.419
when you get it really fresh like that

451.77 --> 458.91999999999996
yeah just don't overdo it because it can

455.53 --> 469.71999999999997
also burden your intestine flora if you

458.92 --> 471.82
take a lot of it especially fresh you

469.72 --> 477.01000000000005
need to go over to captain off the

471.82 --> 478.57
cruise or you would justify uh I guess

477.01 --> 481.40999999999997
that's supposed to be a joke Ragnar

478.57 --> 481.40999999999997
Stefan hey listen

496.38 --> 503.21999999999997
okay that's a weird question good

499.32 --> 505.62
servant if the Sun is not stuck in my

503.22 --> 507.92
head does that mean it is a distance

505.62 --> 507.92
away

514.1 --> 520.4
now of course I get these types of

516.05 --> 523.6999999999999
questions constantly since I try to put

520.4 --> 525.98
out how I view it with the holographic

523.7 --> 529.63
concepts and it is very surreal and even

525.98 --> 534.71
for me it is I have to kind of like

529.63 --> 536.51
retrain my instincts as to assuming what

534.71 --> 538.37
is going on and it actually brings

536.51 --> 541.85
advantages because I do see the

538.37 --> 544.79
holographic nature of it more it's just

541.85 --> 547.6700000000001
how the Sun are the day like distributes

544.79 --> 550.28
in the relation to the specific location

547.67 --> 556.78
I am at it's fascinating to behold every

550.28 --> 559.4599999999999
time it's very beautiful really but I

556.78 --> 564.11
just don't even see the Sun as an object

559.46 --> 569.9000000000001
I just see it as a blinding holographic

564.11 --> 573.32
side effect of looking at the straight

569.9 --> 576.7099999999999
into the daylight direction it's just a

573.32 --> 578.72
side effect of that light manifesting in

576.71 --> 581.51
that specific angle that's what how I

578.72 --> 587.63
see it so I don't really see the Sun as

581.51 --> 591.3199999999999
an object just as you wouldn't see a

587.63 --> 593.54
rainbow as an object to figure it out

591.32 --> 596.0200000000001
and it's much easier to figure out with

593.54 --> 596.02
the rainbow

605.16 --> 608.75
has to be a distance away

609.48 --> 616.5
oh if it is something then you could

613.65 --> 619.13
argue for that but I don't think the Sun

616.5 --> 623.16
is anything I just think it's a

619.13 --> 626.13
holographic like side effect looking at

623.16 --> 633.77
the daylight direction in relation to

626.13 --> 633.77
your position in that time frame

639.89 --> 644.51
yeah but that's but that's really

642.13 --> 647.54
difficult to conceptualize even

644.51 --> 654.019
especially when you get taught that the

647.54 --> 658.43
Sun is this giant ball of fire with CGI

654.019 --> 660.529
and just the awesomeness of the extreme

658.43 --> 662.66
temperatures and what is it in beneath

660.529 --> 666.56
and vly it's all very acts it was very

662.66 --> 669.829
exciting to me this story so to overcome

666.56 --> 672.26
that and just take a big step back say

669.829 --> 679.01
wait it's not enough yeah this is huge

672.26 --> 685.329
it's very difficult I get it it's even

679.01 --> 688.0699999999999
still a little difficult for me but only

685.329 --> 692.019
the force of habit that come from it

688.07 --> 694.82
that's difficult to get out of the way

692.019 --> 698.029
to just look at the Sun and just as a

694.82 --> 700.48
first assumption say automatically in

698.029 --> 705.079
your mind just like yeah that's the big

700.48 --> 710.899
light that's a big thing because your

705.079 --> 714.17
intuition just yeah it has to choose as

710.899 --> 716.81
it were as to how to interpret it and to

714.17 --> 724.12
interpret it as a thing yeah physicality

716.81 --> 727.2199999999999
assumption bias that is natural to do it

724.12 --> 730.16
forces a more practical approach like

727.22 --> 732.769
physical interaction to be able to deal

730.16 --> 736.029
with something to assume it as an object

732.769 --> 736.029
makes it a lot easier

746.21 --> 749.32
[Music]

749.37 --> 754.35
hello Crockett family farms by the way

754.68 --> 766.6899999999999
to this Sunday morning for the United

758.68 --> 769.5999999999999
States it does bring heat no no daylight

766.69 --> 773.5
brings heat good servin the Sun doesn't

769.6 --> 775.029
do anything it's just lining Oh Chad is

773.5 --> 784.48
frozen thank you for pointing that out

775.029 --> 787.41
secret Asian man and welcome yeah thank

784.48 --> 787.41
you

805.51 --> 808.51
Wow

813.6 --> 821.08
my own little bubble dreamworld well

816.91 --> 823.51
wave seven if you can point at somebody

821.08 --> 826.96
that isn't in their own little bubble

823.51 --> 829.99
dreamworld that they have constructed

826.96 --> 832.6
for themselves assimilating whatever's

829.99 --> 835.24
reached from the outside to them yeah

832.6 --> 837.3100000000001
because that's how humans form their

835.24 --> 840.76
inner world if you can point that

837.31 --> 843.76
anybody else out there that is very

840.76 --> 847.87
happy happy in their little dream bubble

843.76 --> 853.24
world as you try to derogatory approach

847.87 --> 858.52
it for me is yeah I am relatively at

853.24 --> 861.16
peace in this very basic setting like

858.52 --> 863.23
baseline approach I'm a much more at

861.16 --> 865.9
peace because I don't get distracted by

863.23 --> 868.9300000000001
fear poor nonsense based on the uh

865.9 --> 871.75
nonsense on the heliocentric nonsense

868.93 --> 875.41
anymore and I used to a lot it would

871.75 --> 877.12
every time see something about it yeah I

875.41 --> 879.1899999999999
would click it away but it would still

877.12 --> 881.83
shock me for a moment and that sucked

879.19 --> 884.1400000000001
because I thought yeah mate like are

881.83 --> 885.37
they bluffing or is it real it would

884.14 --> 889.12
worry me because I thought it was

885.37 --> 891.79
possible and now I realized that it's

889.12 --> 897.67
all just nonsense and that makes me a

891.79 --> 900.27
lot more at peace so yeah it's much

897.67 --> 900.27
better this way

905.12 --> 913.67
oh really I'm hurting other ones why

910.329 --> 915.949
because their dream world is not stable

913.67 --> 920.8389999999999
enough because they clumsily put it

915.949 --> 922.49
together trusting in crazy things giving

920.839 --> 924.0500000000001
up their own sensibilities in the

922.49 --> 926.9590000000001
construction process of their dream

924.05 --> 930.41
world and that and because I don't do

926.959 --> 932.899
that that hurts them I don't think so I

930.41 --> 936.559
think that's on them you know if they

932.899 --> 946.249
don't like what I have to say then go

936.559 --> 950.269
away you know yeah no sure no sir I

946.249 --> 953.779
don't I don't hurt anyone by describing

950.269 --> 957.379
exactly how I see things and helping

953.779 --> 960.98
other people understand that right that

957.379 --> 964.339
doesn't hurt anyone and I don't if

960.98 --> 967.249
somebody I am in direct communication

964.339 --> 970.22
with if they don't understand it I'm not

967.249 --> 972.7090000000001
gonna be attacking them verbally over it

970.22 --> 975.1990000000001
because it is very tough I know it is

972.709 --> 978.92
very tough to understand it is kind it

975.199 --> 982.87
was very tough for me to really get that

978.92 --> 985.2489999999999
how that works clear and to rearrange my

982.87 --> 986.9590000000001
intuition to adapt to that it was very

985.249 --> 990.2900000000001
tough to do that so I don't expect

986.959 --> 992.6289999999999
everybody to get it and I also don't

990.29 --> 994.73
necessarily want people to just say oh

992.629 --> 997.0690000000001
yeah yeah yeah yeah you are witness got

994.73 --> 999.23
it right and then when people ask ask

997.069 --> 1001.329
about it they really don't understand

999.23 --> 1006.2090000000001
that well I don't really appreciate that

1001.329 --> 1009.04
I don't need blind yeh sayers

1006.209 --> 1011.439
unless they really understand and are

1009.04 --> 1014.879
behind it but they got to be able to

1011.439 --> 1018.0999999999999
prove that but I don't hurt anyone I

1014.879 --> 1021.179
don't hurt anyone by just explaining how

1018.1 --> 1026.88
I see things and what I think is

1021.179 --> 1026.8799999999999
generally the best way to go with things

1029.9 --> 1041.48
sorry sorry I'm I'm not I'm not falling

1036.81 --> 1044.87
for your stupid little gamma trap sir

1041.48 --> 1044.8700000000001
Groot sir

1045.17 --> 1048.249
[Music]

1051.14 --> 1059.2700000000002
[Music]

1087.27 --> 1090.6
dear God

1102.82 --> 1105.51
yeah

1109.55 --> 1117.71
yeah well you know what wave seven look

1114.05 --> 1122.96
if you want to be so liberal and go with

1117.71 --> 1126.14
the system you do realize that if

1122.96 --> 1134.69
families literally break apart over

1126.14 --> 1139.16
somebody having a different belief about

1134.69 --> 1141.5
apart anything really that is that the

1139.16 --> 1143.66
person's fault for falling out of line

1141.5 --> 1145.93
with their belief or does it mean that

1143.66 --> 1148.7900000000002
the family simply isn't strong enough

1145.93 --> 1152.78
because everybody's gotten kind of weak

1148.79 --> 1155.81
minded from just going into the real and

1152.78 --> 1157.91
not really critically constructing there

1155.81 --> 1160.79
are principles and all that which a lot

1157.91 --> 1167.8100000000002
of people tend to then avoid if they get

1160.79 --> 1170.6299999999999
very comfortable both yeah well you know

1167.81 --> 1174.53
what wave seven I remember family's

1170.63 --> 1180.5900000000001
falling apart over talk about 9/11 I've

1174.53 --> 1184.46
heard families fall apart over Trump oh

1180.59 --> 1186.8899999999999
yeah does that mean that oh my god every

1184.46 --> 1189.83
time you talk about Trump

1186.89 --> 1194.8600000000001
oh you're damaging people you're hurting

1189.83 --> 1194.86
them for talking about Trump series man

1195.67 --> 1202.52
you got no ground to stand on with your

1198.29 --> 1206.99
argument buddy you know Flat Earth can

1202.52 --> 1209.12
be very tough for some people but it's

1206.99 --> 1212.78
usually when they're already stuck in

1209.12 --> 1215.81
some kind of rigid format in the family

1212.78 --> 1221.18
or whatever and Flat Earth is really the

1215.81 --> 1223.49
way to break out you can if you really

1221.18 --> 1228.4
need to if you need to escape if you

1223.49 --> 1230.99
feel in prison my social hierarchy or

1228.4 --> 1234.19
people and they're delusional stories

1230.99 --> 1234.19
that think they always win

1235.13 --> 1244.92
but yeah it's up to everyone and look

1239.24 --> 1248.18
Flat Earth I I've always said I don't

1244.92 --> 1251.88
really think it is something you should

1248.18 --> 1253.98
like bring two small children in a

1251.88 --> 1257.5100000000002
direct setting like one on one that's

1253.98 --> 1260.43
that's you don't know what it could do

1257.51 --> 1263.36
it's like do it with parental guidance

1260.43 --> 1266.28
at least up to 12 or something you know

1263.36 --> 1268.4399999999998
12 is kind of the average age when they

1266.28 --> 1273.84
can take a little bit more serious

1268.44 --> 1276.39
things and then yet if they really want

1273.84 --> 1279.1499999999999
to know about it then why not but before

1276.39 --> 1282.18
that time yeah it's always think about

1279.15 --> 1291.21
the parents how they want their kid to

1282.18 --> 1293.28
grow up and yeah but that's I'm not like

1291.21 --> 1299.3700000000001
talking to little kids about Flat Earth

1293.28 --> 1302.96
like that I really never talk to little

1299.37 --> 1302.9599999999998
kids if their parents aren't there

1313.32 --> 1321.04
yeah now a Larry to March

1316.17 --> 1327.7
that's because having a job as a

1321.04 --> 1331.57
scientist is not about being smart it's

1327.7 --> 1336.16
about falling in line going with the

1331.57 --> 1339.85
narrative going with the consensus going

1336.16 --> 1341.68
with bypassing the scientific method and

1339.85 --> 1343.6599999999999
yeah you'll get a job you'll get paid in

1341.68 --> 1345.16
all people respect you and you can talk

1343.66 --> 1347.38
with like you're the smartest person on

1345.16 --> 1350.53
earth as long as you help build what

1347.38 --> 1357.64
they're building right well that's not

1350.53 --> 1361.03
for me buddy I couldn't in a way I could

1357.64 --> 1362.74
but I would always as disclaimer every

1361.03 --> 1365.47
time I did it and they don't like that I

1362.74 --> 1367.39
would always say this is all presupposed

1365.47 --> 1369.97
this is exactly how it is presupposed

1367.39 --> 1373.18
let's get into the dream okay this is

1369.97 --> 1376.84
how I think balls out in space word yeah

1373.18 --> 1388.39
oh yeah I can do that oh yeah but I will

1376.84 --> 1390.31
never claim that that is real and that's

1388.39 --> 1394.1100000000001
not good enough that's not good enough

1390.31 --> 1394.11
for the world of scientism

1397.16 --> 1401.0400000000002
maybe at some point it will you know I

1399.57 --> 1403.46
don't know where it's going really at

1401.04 --> 1403.46
this point

1424.2 --> 1427.19
mmm-hmm

1431.809 --> 1437.859
all right Larry March 4 falling out of

1434.539 --> 1437.859
line so

1440.29 --> 1444.75
how do you think that came into being

1446.64 --> 1453.76
are you saying I should just like oh

1449.44 --> 1455.3200000000002
yeah you know what I'm going out there

1453.76 --> 1457.75
as a flattered scientist I'm gonna do

1455.32 --> 1463.3899999999999
anything I'm gonna get loans and [ __ ]

1457.75 --> 1470.38
and just start making a school yeah what

1463.39 --> 1473.67
you think is gonna happen no I'm just

1470.38 --> 1477.16
here to teach and hope that everybody

1473.67 --> 1480.93
kind of can catch on to what I'm saying

1477.16 --> 1485.2900000000002
and that it will make people think and

1480.93 --> 1487.3
potentially help them rearrange the

1485.29 --> 1489.96
understanding and the teachings

1487.3 --> 1489.96
eventually

1494.98 --> 1499.27
but it would all be voluntary through

1497.38 --> 1503.65
their own insights through their own

1499.27 --> 1506.77
empirical studies and their own

1503.65 --> 1509.7900000000002
psychological discipline not to yield to

1506.77 --> 1513.28
peer pressure or bodies of science

1509.79 --> 1515.08
without personally taking very sharp

1513.28 --> 1518.35
note as to where the empirical evidence

1515.08 --> 1521.23
lies what is the data and how have they

1518.35 --> 1523.87
come to their conclusions about it you

1521.23 --> 1528.33
know that's all part of it it's like

1523.87 --> 1531.4599999999998
data analysis I can do that

1528.33 --> 1534.54
always more and more did that so much

1531.46 --> 1534.54
weight to it to doing that

1538.11 --> 1548.36
yeah Larry the March yeah I know

1542.15 --> 1552.93
ironic isn't it guess what what you call

1548.36 --> 1555.06
science is a religion because it is in

1552.93 --> 1557.67
science it's not scientific method based

1555.06 --> 1562.56
it's all presuppositional [ __ ] spin

1557.67 --> 1566.5700000000002
doctoring machinations vast vast model

1562.56 --> 1570.1799999999998
with mega sized holes all covered up in

1566.57 --> 1572.76
in ridicule and intimidation to force

1570.18 --> 1577.53
people to just keep the image and don't

1572.76 --> 1581.1
inquire it is a religion absolutely it

1577.53 --> 1583.35
is Larry the March there's nothing to do

1581.1 --> 1587.33
with what science really is what it was

1583.35 --> 1587.33
originally it's a mutation

1633.59 --> 1640.48
oh really wave seven is that what I do

1636.35 --> 1643.73
is that what I do are are you falsely

1640.48 --> 1646.01
equivocating what I do with a lot of

1643.73 --> 1648.8600000000001
other people out there that are really

1646.01 --> 1651.41
kind of going wild with it you know

1648.86 --> 1653.6599999999999
because a lot of flat earthers are all

1651.41 --> 1655.5800000000002
very different people that have very

1653.66 --> 1658.28
different approaches to the world and

1655.58 --> 1660.4099999999999
some are really kind of like yeah I

1658.28 --> 1665.12
really don't give a [ __ ] because they

1660.41 --> 1666.6200000000001
live in cultures or in areas where

1665.12 --> 1669.26
people really don't give a [ __ ] anymore

1666.62 --> 1672.1999999999998
about anything so they'll just like flat

1669.26 --> 1677.18
smack people in a fight even or whatever

1672.2 --> 1679.07
just crazy situations but that's them in

1677.18 --> 1685.19
their locations I don't do that

1679.07 --> 1689.0
absolutely never never so don't falsely

1685.19 --> 1692.81
equivocate me with how some other people

1689.0 --> 1695.95
do it in their respective regions okay

1692.81 --> 1695.95
thank you very much

1708.77 --> 1717.2
okay yeah well Philip Cooper sure but I

1712.55 --> 1719.0
think that let's say up to 30,000 feet I

1717.2 --> 1722.72
think that pressure readings have been

1719.0 --> 1726.35
pretty well established it's really the

1722.72 --> 1728.03
mysteries are what is further up where

1726.35 --> 1730.3999999999999
has it literally be filled in how can

1728.03 --> 1737.9289999999999
you get there in order to take that

1730.4 --> 1743.45
reading and an expeditionary to go with

1737.929 --> 1747.4
that you just need to figure out some

1743.45 --> 1752.44
technology and get a good project going

1747.4 --> 1752.44
like as an alternative to a rocket maybe

1763.88 --> 1771.8300000000002
like what for example how would for

1768.32 --> 1778.1499999999999
example like a mini blimp work very

1771.83 --> 1784.309
superlight mini blim how would that work

1778.15 --> 1788.23
could you get farther up it's like

1784.309 --> 1788.23
instead of a drone you get a mini blimp

1791.69 --> 1795.8300000000002
because yeah mini blimp just like a

1794.0 --> 1797.6
regular balloon at ground level II

1795.83 --> 1800.3
that's gonna be hugely just swapped

1797.6 --> 1803.4199999999998
aside from the wind it it's very fragile

1800.3 --> 1806.06
but hey way up there I don't think

1803.42 --> 1808.94
there's all these winds you know there's

1806.06 --> 1811.46
no constant wind gales some point it

1808.94 --> 1813.94
just comes becomes kind of still and it

1811.46 --> 1813.94
could work

1816.22 --> 1821.42
you know the great Asian man stop

1818.87 --> 1823.79
wasting your critical your time

1821.42 --> 1826.67
critically thinking and stuff yeah sorry

1823.79 --> 1827.96
I I am I am definitely gonna do that and

1826.67 --> 1830.17
the funny thing is that even though

1827.96 --> 1834.14
people may not be listening right here

1830.17 --> 1839.14
somebody can see this and suddenly get

1834.14 --> 1839.14
like mmm an idea from it so

1845.07 --> 1848.62
and I think the idea of like a drone

1847.72 --> 1852.84
blimp

1848.62 --> 1852.84
it's actually kind of interesting

1856.18 --> 1862.68
you know there is this advantage at

1858.82 --> 1865.12
getting things small remember the ants

1862.68 --> 1866.89
smallest things get the more potential

1865.12 --> 1869.7299999999998
rigidity and strength without

1866.89 --> 1872.3500000000001
necessarily also gaining that weight so

1869.73 --> 1877.24
maybe like a balloon the standard

1872.35 --> 1879.9099999999999
approach with the Box maybe it could be

1877.24 --> 1883.27
done better in a way that it would

1879.91 --> 1885.4
literally all be lighter that the frame

1883.27 --> 1889.21
of the material of the the technology

1885.4 --> 1892.72
would be relatively so light that it

1889.21 --> 1897.46
would not offset the density average of

1892.72 --> 1899.77
the whole blimp thing and then you could

1897.46 --> 1902.22
potentially raise even a lot higher how

1899.77 --> 1902.22
about that

1910.82 --> 1917.029
brettly's weather balloons equipped with

1913.22 --> 1918.6200000000001
time pressure a sampling mechanism well

1917.029 --> 1920.72
you could you don't even you could just

1918.62 --> 1923.779
keep it digital you don't necessarily

1920.72 --> 1934.6000000000001
even have to make it mechanical for the

1923.779 --> 1934.6
Cooper yeah Laurie piss off

1957.12 --> 1965.07
objects

1959.25 --> 1968.82
well Jeffrey Brown 4k no image objects

1965.07 --> 1971.039
are generally defined as solid things

1968.82 --> 1974.52
well on average solid things tend to

1971.039 --> 1979.11
have a lot higher density than when

1974.52 --> 1981.0
they're then the gas of the the air

1979.11 --> 1983.309
layer on the earth they're surrounded

1981.0 --> 1985.23
with so they're there of course objects

1983.309 --> 1987.27
will fall down because their density on

1985.23 --> 1990.21
average is always higher unless you can

1987.27 --> 1992.25
point me at some kind of solid that is

1990.21 --> 1995.429
actually lighter than air that would be

1992.25 --> 1998.669
interesting don't think it exists but

1995.429 --> 2000.89
yeah it's not that mysterious its

1998.669 --> 2005.45
density relative density this

2000.89 --> 2008.23
equilibrium causes objects to fall down

2005.45 --> 2008.23
towards the earth

2012.18 --> 2015.5990000000002
[Music]

2021.27 --> 2030.73
[Music]

2024.549 --> 2030.73
that's not appropriate talk here AGM

2074.44 --> 2077.94
any Robin Sally

2091.52 --> 2100.43
yeah secret Asian and the look wave 7 is

2095.11 --> 2102.53
obviously a reversed world troll and a

2100.43 --> 2105.47
flat earth is just one of the other

2102.53 --> 2108.2900000000004
things that they attack like a lot of

2105.47 --> 2110.99
things and they will push controversial

2108.29 --> 2116.48
polarizing [ __ ] in our faces to distract

2110.99 --> 2119.33
away from having control over come hang

2116.48 --> 2122.09
out here with actually interesting

2119.33 --> 2125.0
subjects because the more interesting

2122.09 --> 2128.21
things become an inspiring the more it

2125.0 --> 2130.43
hurts them because it all distracts them

2128.21 --> 2137.93
away from their reversed world dream

2130.43 --> 2141.56
state and I'm pretty sure that wave 7 is

2137.93 --> 2143.54
one of these types of individuals so of

2141.56 --> 2147.41
course you don't feel controlled at all

2143.54 --> 2149.38
in your life you know what that doesn't

2147.41 --> 2153.5
mean that you aren't it just means that

2149.38 --> 2155.75
your sense is in that order really don't

2153.5 --> 2159.44
function properly anymore it's been

2155.75 --> 2163.57
bypassed by you to be able to endure the

2159.44 --> 2163.57
state you are in to keep going

2207.03 --> 2210.1800000000003
all right

2234.809 --> 2242.7490000000003
oh wave 7 look there are Scrolls and

2238.919 --> 2247.0789999999997
there's trolls I'm not saying you're a

2242.749 --> 2250.259
just a spam with disgusting [ __ ] no no

2247.079 --> 2253.8590000000004
no no I'm not saying you're you're even

2250.259 --> 2256.169
like troll no but just you have a very

2253.859 --> 2257.909
specific agenda that drives you I can

2256.169 --> 2261.239
feel it I can feel it with every

2257.909 --> 2265.199
sentence you put down there it's very

2261.239 --> 2268.409
very tangible to me I recognize it seen

2265.199 --> 2271.679
it before a lot the way you respond to

2268.409 --> 2274.0190000000002
things it's very obvious and that is a

2271.679 --> 2276.259
reversed world state it's part of that

2274.019 --> 2280.6189999999997
system that doesn't make you a fallout

2276.259 --> 2284.699
demon down the spectrum but it is part

2280.619 --> 2288.589
of that direction if you allow yourself

2284.699 --> 2291.2090000000003
to get go that far a lot of people don't

2288.589 --> 2295.709
but they're still part of that structure

2291.209 --> 2298.549
of that reversed world trance because

2295.709 --> 2301.549
that is what the ball earth is part of

2298.549 --> 2301.549
unfortunately

2311.93 --> 2328.569
hmm well wave seven look I've had a

2321.319 --> 2328.569
channel now for said for five years now

2328.96 --> 2339.589
yeah well my life is indeed a lot better

2335.51 --> 2345.559
and there is a stark difference between

2339.589 --> 2351.849
me five years ago and me now a big

2345.559 --> 2356.1800000000003
difference because back then I was still

2351.849 --> 2359.21
like more like I still have the elements

2356.18 --> 2365.27
of it it's like paranoia suspicion but

2359.21 --> 2368.51
it was so hard fed into because of where

2365.27 --> 2371.299
I went with because I fell for the fear

2368.51 --> 2375.4700000000003
porn because I didn't really know how

2371.299 --> 2380.599
much is fake and I was pretty damn

2375.47 --> 2382.91
miserable and I had some like yeah I

2380.599 --> 2384.77
really couldn't couldn't really not

2382.91 --> 2386.42
connect with people and now there is a

2384.77 --> 2387.77
difference I'm still having trouble

2386.42 --> 2391.099
connecting with people but at least

2387.77 --> 2393.68
people seem to just find me more

2391.099 --> 2395.839
pleasant to be around on average it's a

2393.68 --> 2399.25
big difference and it's almost surreal

2395.839 --> 2399.25
because I'm not used to that

2408.6 --> 2415.98
so yeah Flat Earth and the whole

2412.5 --> 2417.6
learning process and in the inquiring

2415.98 --> 2420.54
the information figuring things out for

2417.6 --> 2423.33
real unabated by some kind of peer

2420.54 --> 2426.12
pressure even among our own okay because

2423.33 --> 2428.94
hey remember I got peer pressure from

2426.12 --> 2432.81
the flat earthers as well for my ideas

2428.94 --> 2435.18
especially early on lots of it and I had

2432.81 --> 2435.9
to like fight sometimes and hey I made

2435.18 --> 2437.6699999999996
mistakes

2435.9 --> 2439.59
I thought gravity really was a thing

2437.67 --> 2442.14
until I figured out it was an aberration

2439.59 --> 2444.4500000000003
oh yeah you damn well better believe I

2442.14 --> 2446.8199999999997
got a lot of heat for that but it was

2444.45 --> 2449.3399999999997
all well worth it because I was there to

2446.82 --> 2453.81
learn to get to the bottom of it

2449.34 --> 2458.82
for real and go there empirically more

2453.81 --> 2461.43
and more really go there and it's been

2458.82 --> 2464.6400000000003
great and I have a lot of confidence now

2461.43 --> 2466.83
also in all that knowledge where before

2464.64 --> 2469.5
it was just a whole fake and preliminary

2466.83 --> 2471.63
enough I thought like I remembered that

2469.5 --> 2473.61
story that I thought sounded really

2471.63 --> 2476.28
reliable I'll go with that and I heard

2473.61 --> 2478.4700000000003
this story that sounded reliable but I

2476.28 --> 2479.9700000000003
didn't really understand it and I didn't

2478.47 --> 2481.83
understand the backdrop and where they

2479.97 --> 2483.72
came from and what was going around or

2481.83 --> 2486.23
Cokely and bla bla bla bla I didn't get

2483.72 --> 2489.24
any of that so it was a mess

2486.23 --> 2494.31
but still improvised very intuitive but

2489.24 --> 2496.89
improvised and not really structured a

2494.31 --> 2499.71
lot and now I'm talking about yeah up

2496.89 --> 2502.02
until 5 years ago and before that for a

2499.71 --> 2504.54
long period and now it's all much if all

2502.02 --> 2511.73
falls into place I feel so much more

2504.54 --> 2515.73
like I really get how things work from a

2511.73 --> 2517.35
top-down structure though but as for my

2515.73 --> 2519.6
personal interaction

2517.35 --> 2522.48
I like how do I personally engage with

2519.6 --> 2524.46
people in the world face to face that is

2522.48 --> 2529.56
still somewhat difficult but that is

2524.46 --> 2533.36
because I feel like I'm very complicated

2529.56 --> 2536.12
and I don't really fit into any typical

2533.36 --> 2538.23
stereotypical attitude that I see people

2536.12 --> 2541.95
communicating with it doesn't fit me

2538.23 --> 2542.44
almost none of it it's always too much

2541.95 --> 2545.98
of one

2542.44 --> 2550.27
erection so I really don't have some

2545.98 --> 2552.069
kind of standard attitude to take on the

2550.27 --> 2554.369
other hand if people approach me that

2552.069 --> 2557.56
works fantastically I always know how to

2554.369 --> 2559.51
respond because by their approach they

2557.56 --> 2561.88
already signal as to what they're kind

2559.51 --> 2563.829
of expecting of me and that gives me a

2561.88 --> 2565.81
hint as to how they see me and then I

2563.829 --> 2569.6800000000003
can play into that and then I suddenly

2565.81 --> 2576.2799999999997
fit a role it's weird

2569.68 --> 2581.589
I know I'm just not a fluid socializer I

2576.28 --> 2583.5400000000004
never have been in my life yeah yeah and

2581.589 --> 2586.0
what they call what they used to call

2583.54 --> 2589.21
more of a monologue I guess that's why a

2586.0 --> 2591.369
daily show with me just talking for over

2589.21 --> 2592.109
an hour tends to work because I just do

2591.369 --> 2595.7200000000003
that

2592.109 --> 2598.359
and on the other hand it's um you all of

2595.72 --> 2600.339
you must have noticed that if I do have

2598.359 --> 2603.19
guests on it's always kind of good you

2600.339 --> 2605.68
know it's friendly but I do sometimes

2603.19 --> 2608.65
you do feel it off me right that I

2605.68 --> 2614.47
sometimes like like oh [ __ ] what do I do

2608.65 --> 2618.2200000000003
next or it's not a super fluid as with a

2614.47 --> 2620.339
lot of other people when they get guests

2618.22 --> 2620.339
on

2625.02 --> 2627.8
anyway

2630.27 --> 2633.48
[Music]

2655.9 --> 2664.9
really wave 7 that seems incredibly

2659.529 --> 2667.66
short-sighted oh I don't think no one of

2664.9 --> 2669.46
you will change maybe in 20 or 30 years

2667.66 --> 2673.5989999999997
but not in the next 5

2669.46 --> 2677.349
what are you specifying as in changing

2673.599 --> 2679.6600000000003
back from this delusion of Flat Earth

2677.349 --> 2681.46
back to the globe is that the kind of

2679.66 --> 2685.5389999999998
change you're pointing in well yeah

2681.46 --> 2690.759
they're 2030 well maybe just a lifetime

2685.539 --> 2693.2490000000003
really but yeah as s goes for a general

2690.759 --> 2696.249
changing yeah of course we change we

2693.249 --> 2698.2889999999998
change as things happen it's one of the

2696.249 --> 2701.16
things that as a flat earther you

2698.289 --> 2704.559
actually get to do a lot more adapt

2701.16 --> 2707.89
because when you fall in line when you

2704.559 --> 2711.4
go with the with the system or the

2707.89 --> 2714.64
narrative and you don't insert your own

2711.4 --> 2718.299
personal deviations of that that is when

2714.64 --> 2721.42
you stall but we are constantly building

2718.299 --> 2724.359
so we change a lot in our attitudes in

2721.42 --> 2725.89
our realizations in our own disciplines

2724.359 --> 2728.739
in our own area

2725.89 --> 2732.91
a lot of people in the flat earth scene

2728.739 --> 2735.43
have changed some of yeah some of them

2732.91 --> 2738.0389999999998
pretty dramatically I'd like to think

2735.43 --> 2739.69
that I'm among those because I feel are

2738.039 --> 2745.15
very different than from the beginning

2739.69 --> 2747.549
much less wild and yeah some of them

2745.15 --> 2749.319
don't change a lot and they get stuck in

2747.549 --> 2750.999
their own typical cycles but you know

2749.319 --> 2752.95
that has nothing to do with flat earth

2750.999 --> 2754.8689999999997
it's really where they came from it's

2752.95 --> 2759.569
their own issues that keep them stuck

2754.869 --> 2759.569
there so

2766.43 --> 2770.3199999999997
oh don't worry secret is you man

2782.69 --> 2787.42
this yeah

2789.19 --> 2795.17
except for the super far distant direct

2792.8 --> 2797.6600000000003
line of sight wave 7 how about that

2795.17 --> 2799.16
the missing curvature that's how we sum

2797.66 --> 2802.0699999999997
that's how we tend to call it the

2799.16 --> 2804.0499999999997
missing curvature to emphasize that

2802.07 --> 2806.81
thing that needs to be there for your

2804.05 --> 2809.27
model to be a reality it's not there

2806.81 --> 2812.44
but practically it is the super long

2809.27 --> 2815.35
distance sites and hey how about the

2812.44 --> 2820.4
thousand mile radar ability

2815.35 --> 2823.79
how about transatlantic communication

2820.4 --> 2827.9
before satellites with giant towers how

2823.79 --> 2831.05
about is that any kind of evidence that

2827.9 --> 2835.67
the earth is probably as good as flat

2831.05 --> 2837.6800000000003
and not the specific geometrical sphere

2835.67 --> 2841.54
that the globe Earth model says it

2837.68 --> 2841.54
should be maybe

2851.56 --> 2857.2
all right seeking star water there's

2853.51 --> 2861.57
death then yeah it's all explained what

2857.2 --> 2864.52
you mean it's all explained away with

2861.57 --> 2867.01
the presupposition that there is our

2864.52 --> 2869.68
base terrestrial refraction that makes

2867.01 --> 2875.11
literally everything all signals all

2869.68 --> 2878.23
waves all light everything that moves it

2875.11 --> 2880.36
automatically all bends it into a visual

2878.23 --> 2882.4
perfect flat plane where you can

2880.36 --> 2883.9300000000003
literally see extreme distances that

2882.4 --> 2887.2000000000003
should not be possible on the globe is

2883.93 --> 2889.72
that what you're going with the supreme

2887.2 --> 2891.52
terrestrial refraction of ultra mega

2889.72 --> 2895.0299999999997
looming everything bending into a flat

2891.52 --> 2899.41
plane at absurd distances that cannot by

2895.03 --> 2903.82
the way even to be properly models so

2899.41 --> 2906.3399999999997
ways the other way around you derive the

2903.82 --> 2909.25
ball from the flat plane that's a lot

2906.34 --> 2912.25
easier than actually doing it the other

2909.25 --> 2914.17
way around so there's no even proper

2912.25 --> 2917.86
formula for it but that is what is

2914.17 --> 2922.42
assumed that it terrestrial refraction

2917.86 --> 2926.02
it all looms up to be visible exactly as

2922.42 --> 2929.83
if it were on a perfect flat plane when

2926.02 --> 2933.25
there is not enough Eric lack of air

2929.83 --> 2936.22
clarity to obstruct that far distant

2933.25 --> 2938.35
view yeah that's what they're going with

2936.22 --> 2940.74
right now you do realize that right wave

2938.35 --> 2940.74
7

2948.28 --> 2953.7400000000002
well made your tongue because there is

2950.65 --> 2957.27
no need for it there's no need for a

2953.74 --> 2961.54
model yet and they're still missing data

2957.27 --> 2965.29
you know the most important aspect as to

2961.54 --> 2967.36
even begin it somewhat reliable Flat

2965.29 --> 2970.24
Earth model is first to establish the

2967.36 --> 2972.31
parameters of this realm and an

2970.24 --> 2975.6099999999997
important place to start that is kind of

2972.31 --> 2979.7799999999997
doable for us at this point is to size

2975.61 --> 2983.38
up whether the equator that that Sun

2979.78 --> 2986.8500000000004
relation deduced position over the earth

2983.38 --> 2990.4900000000002
right if the equator is a perfect line

2986.85 --> 2993.61
if it is a Ark than my circle or if it

2990.49 --> 2996.1299999999997
is an actual geometrical closing

2993.61 --> 2999.46
physical circle it's a very important

2996.13 --> 3002.6400000000003
thing to establish first before we can

2999.46 --> 3004.4700000000003
start to puzzle out what the realm is

3002.64 --> 3006.3199999999997
like and what its nature is if there is

3004.47 --> 3009.68
a looping factor or if it is in fact

3006.32 --> 3013.17
enclosed in some kind of a half bubble

3009.68 --> 3016.89
we need to know the landmass orientation

3013.17 --> 3020.28
and the celestial orientation to get

3016.89 --> 3024.6
that perfectly straight and then we can

3020.28 --> 3028.32
well we can and we will make a Flat

3024.6 --> 3030.36
Earth model but up until that point it

3028.32 --> 3032.2200000000003
will all be presuppositional based on

3030.36 --> 3033.63
different angles of approach like are

3032.22 --> 3037.08
you gonna go with the disc with the

3033.63 --> 3039.48
equator circle base or are you gonna go

3037.08 --> 3041.4
with the looping model with a yeah

3039.48 --> 3043.41
looping space which is kind of surreal

3041.4 --> 3045.6600000000003
to a lot of people but can work in my

3043.41 --> 3051.69
opinion trainman station from the matrix

3045.66 --> 3055.5
to that set up F well until we know more

3051.69 --> 3058.38
there's very little use in presupposing

3055.5 --> 3059.91
our models are to be real because we

3058.38 --> 3063.0
just be doing the same thing as the

3059.91 --> 3065.19
ballers we would be presupposing and

3063.0 --> 3066.87
that's just as useless so we're not on

3065.19 --> 3070.02
average doing that although a lot of

3066.87 --> 3073.43
people love the baseline disc with the

3070.02 --> 3076.11
bubble just as an alternative visual

3073.43 --> 3078.2999999999997
representation to the ball or so people

3076.11 --> 3080.8900000000003
can at least have an alternative

3078.3 --> 3083.7200000000003
imagination to start out with

3080.89 --> 3085.91
but that's not really a model it's just

3083.72 --> 3087.5
a visual to try to break people out of

3085.91 --> 3088.49
the ball spell to show that there is

3087.5 --> 3093.38
another way

3088.49 --> 3096.3799999999997
at least preliminary conceptually

3093.38 --> 3098.57
possible so they can visually imagine it

3096.38 --> 3102.32
somewhat better that's what that is it's

3098.57 --> 3104.3900000000003
not literal and they some flat-earthers

3102.32 --> 3106.46
may even start to believe that it is

3104.39 --> 3109.0699999999997
literal they say it is literal while

3106.46 --> 3113.42
they're mistaken if they do that it's

3109.07 --> 3115.73
kind of stupid but hey all people dumb

3113.42 --> 3118.2200000000003
tendencies if they let themselves go

3115.73 --> 3120.62
with that so doesn't necessarily make

3118.22 --> 3128.18
them idiots but yeah it doesn't make

3120.62 --> 3130.85
them clumsy so yeah we don't really need

3128.18 --> 3134.5099999999998
a model to absolutely

3130.85 --> 3137.0
pummel the heliocentric spinning globe

3134.51 --> 3142.21
earth model in this presupposed outer

3137.0 --> 3142.21
space as Nathan says it

3154.34 --> 3157.55
[Music]

3160.26 --> 3165.8100000000004
Wow

3162.48 --> 3167.52
well wave seven if you got that kind of

3165.81 --> 3173.22
stuff on your mind maybe you shouldn't

3167.52 --> 3177.02
be here I don't accept that kind of talk

3173.22 --> 3177.02
in my chat sorry

3186.17 --> 3190.94
I hope you listen and you learned you

3189.41 --> 3193.7
probably didn't you're now retreating

3190.94 --> 3196.5190000000002
obsessing over that I finally banned you

3193.7 --> 3200.6299999999997
because then you have some kind of oh

3196.519 --> 3201.9799999999996
I'm so hurt story and all flat earthers

3200.63 --> 3203.839
are all evil that you can then bring

3201.98 --> 3205.88
forth to other ballers we know you

3203.839 --> 3208.49
always do that and because you do that

3205.88 --> 3210.319
you completely forget the content of the

3208.49 --> 3212.0
entire discussion even though you

3210.319 --> 3220.4
personally interacted with it that's

3212.0 --> 3225.47
what you all do we know but yeah there's

3220.4 --> 3228.309
certain tolerance limits and as Fyodor

3225.47 --> 3236.9599999999996
Dostoevsky says it self harm is not

3228.309 --> 3239.48
acceptable to talk about really or well

3236.96 --> 3241.4
unless it is somebody really telling a

3239.48 --> 3242.9900000000002
story that has an important point but

3241.4 --> 3245.119
it's not something I want to bring up

3242.99 --> 3258.519
it's not something that I have within me

3245.119 --> 3262.549
ever ready explain this so I have no

3258.519 --> 3266.74
yeah no reason really just to start

3262.549 --> 3266.74
talking about that stuff yeah

3290.39 --> 3294.04
okay it was next

3307.829 --> 3314.789
more color just just it's very easy

3318.319 --> 3324.5589999999997
the right more colors yeah you're kind

3320.509 --> 3328.16
of correct their objects are presumed to

3324.559 --> 3332.6600000000003
be solid and they will fall because on

3328.16 --> 3336.2889999999998
average or well always actually solid

3332.66 --> 3338.8089999999997
objects have lower density than the gas

3336.289 --> 3341.7690000000002
that surrounds them which is the

3338.809 --> 3345.049
majority of the upper side of the earth

3341.769 --> 3348.669
so that causes it the relative density

3345.049 --> 3351.939
disequilibrium causes objects to fall

3348.669 --> 3351.939
are you Nathan

3371.53 --> 3375.059
[Applause]

3371.94 --> 3375.059
[Music]

3409.59 --> 3415.11
oh the other direction well that because

3413.52 --> 3419.1
that is how the relative density

3415.11 --> 3422.01
spectrum is arranged higher density goes

3419.1 --> 3425.61
down lighter density goes up that is how

3422.01 --> 3427.9500000000003
the orientation of this realm is you

3425.61 --> 3431.7000000000003
could consider it a natural law because

3427.95 --> 3437.0699999999997
nothing deviates from that relative

3431.7 --> 3440.43
density stands everywhere and the

3437.07 --> 3442.98
spectrum is clear the less dense goes up

3440.43 --> 3445.56
the denser goes down and that is how

3442.98 --> 3448.77
things arrange themselves it is probably

3445.56 --> 3452.66
also the direct cause of the gradient of

3448.77 --> 3452.66
the gas within our realm

3457.21 --> 3464.87
that's it and yeah that force that you

3462.26 --> 3468.32
all owe you gravity lovers you love it

3464.87 --> 3471.44
so much the force is everywhere may the

3468.32 --> 3474.11
force that is not actually a force but

3471.44 --> 3480.35
you can and must think of it as a force

3474.11 --> 3483.26
be with you no it's not it's not a force

3480.35 --> 3485.63
this equilibrium field that is present

3483.26 --> 3489.26
uniformly and especially not wrapped

3485.63 --> 3494.71
around in spherical geometry it's not

3489.26 --> 3499.6000000000004
that no now it's simply its inherent to

3494.71 --> 3502.07
to the matter itself more dense if

3499.6 --> 3505.37
suddenly it is surrounded by something

3502.07 --> 3509.3300000000004
that has less density than it it will

3505.37 --> 3511.6099999999997
start to be subjected to a force because

3509.33 --> 3515.66
it is in this equilibrium with its

3511.61 --> 3520.76
density spectrum so that force will

3515.66 --> 3522.6499999999996
manifest start pushing on it until it

3520.76 --> 3525.0800000000004
reaches the air friction or whatever it

3522.65 --> 3528.77
is passing through will cause a stable

3525.08 --> 3531.86
speed and then eventually as it meets is

3528.77 --> 3533.69
equilibrium it becomes surrounded by

3531.86 --> 3536.69
something that is more than say water

3533.69 --> 3538.31
then it well it may still fall but it go

3536.69 --> 3538.79
much more slowly and then it might hit

3538.31 --> 3542.6
rocks

3538.79 --> 3544.31
so stop still be surrounded by stuff

3542.6 --> 3549.23
that will make it want to go down and

3544.31 --> 3551.0
then it will instead push with pressure

3549.23 --> 3553.52
because it's still in this equilibrium

3551.0 --> 3555.59
downwards a little well if it's

3553.52 --> 3557.27
literally surrounded by for example a

3555.59 --> 3563.51
heavy liquid then it won't it will

3557.27 --> 3567.22
literally start sitting in there because

3563.51 --> 3572.1800000000003
yeah relative density this equilibrium

3567.22 --> 3574.45
manifests force temporarily its inherent

3572.18 --> 3574.45
to the system

3582.74 --> 3588.6099999999997
why isn't it inherent in space because

3586.34 --> 3592.63
there is no space

3588.61 --> 3592.63
if you mean outer space

3603.36 --> 3611.81
[Music]

3604.53 --> 3615.96
no there's no force pulling things down

3611.81 --> 3617.7
there is displacement manifesting

3615.96 --> 3619.8
there's a force manifesting within

3617.7 --> 3623.7799999999997
matter when it is in it in this

3619.8 --> 3626.73
equilibrium with its relative density

3623.78 --> 3628.8900000000003
yeah that will manifest the force there

3626.73 --> 3639.38
locally but it's not present at all

3628.89 --> 3644.49
times it only is present as long as

3639.38 --> 3647.33
matter is in this equilibrium with it

3644.49 --> 3647.33
with its surroundings

3679.63 --> 3682.63
hmm

3691.17 --> 3695.87
that's an interesting saying Fyodor

3693.54 --> 3695.87
Dostoevsky

3719.26 --> 3733.57
Oh Nathan they all want a piece of you

3726.79 --> 3737.83
know yeah you touch them in a special

3733.57 --> 3741.82
place when you get really strict and

3737.83 --> 3744.09
direct and they'll all want a piece of

3741.82 --> 3744.09
you now

3757.01 --> 3759.5800000000004
yeah

3761.62 --> 3766.45
right yeah but Nathan Oakley that is

3763.75 --> 3768.52
only because they are not allowed to go

3766.45 --> 3770.6499999999996
over the top in my chat and I think

3768.52 --> 3772.36
they're probably aware of that that

3770.65 --> 3775.4700000000003
they'll probably get banned pretty

3772.36 --> 3775.4700000000003
quickly if they do that

3789.31 --> 3792.09
hmm

3802.98 --> 3805.4900000000002
who

3809.31 --> 3811.94
don't

3834.06 --> 3843.41
yeah bait 60 RMC to Bob the science guys

3839.3 --> 3843.4100000000003
what what's this

3854.48 --> 3861.099
this is split personality it's very

3857.75 --> 3861.099
funny nail ioio

3867.83 --> 3872.6
Oh Jeffrey Brown volcano image what

3870.83 --> 3874.97
forces prevent you from floating away

3872.6 --> 3879.5499999999997
it's very simple relative density

3874.97 --> 3883.6099999999997
disequilibrium force because we are

3879.55 --> 3886.36
comprised of a lot of solids and liquids

3883.61 --> 3889.28
that are saturated so it's pretty heavy

3886.36 --> 3892.88
right it's density on average of this

3889.28 --> 3896.51
body is pretty big relative to the air

3892.88 --> 3899.42
you're surrounded with or water so yeah

3896.51 --> 3902.15
that prevents you from floating away

3899.42 --> 3908.39
it's not that difficult buddy it really

3902.15 --> 3913.52
is it yes it is a force relative density

3908.39 --> 3916.16
this equilibrium force it is a force it

3913.52 --> 3919.85
manifests when an object is at this

3916.16 --> 3922.97
equilibrium density wise with its

3919.85 --> 3923.36
surrounding yeah it manifests there it

3922.97 --> 3926.8399999999997
is

3923.36 --> 3929.2400000000002
suddenly something starts to accelerate

3926.84 --> 3930.98
and then hey if it's still in this

3929.24 --> 3932.24
equilibrium but it can't accelerate any

3930.98 --> 3934.94
further there's no more maneuverability

3932.24 --> 3937.66
suddenly that this equilibrium will

3934.94 --> 3942.71
start to translate into pressure locally

3937.66 --> 3943.91
towards the direction where the denser

3942.71 --> 3948.38
things tend to go

3943.91 --> 3950.93
that's our works force yes relative

3948.38 --> 3954.2000000000003
density this equilibrium force not

3950.93 --> 3956.8399999999997
gravity not a constant force this

3954.2 --> 3958.97
equilibrium field present everywhere

3956.84 --> 3964.96
that is presumed to be there and not

3958.97 --> 3964.9599999999996
really provable it's just conceptualize

3983.48 --> 3988.94
are you kidding me Larry to March why

3986.93 --> 3990.8599999999997
would I need to describe it

3988.94 --> 3993.02
mathematically I explain it every I

3990.86 --> 3995.84
explain it every time look if you want

3993.02 --> 3998.69
to take my explanation word for mirth

3995.84 --> 4002.05
and then literally start to deduce them

3998.69 --> 4002.7400000000002
into some kind of math formulation be my

4002.05 --> 4006.52
guest

4002.74 --> 4009.49
I don't care I just know how it works

4006.52 --> 4011.83
when and I can describe and explain it

4009.49 --> 4021.25
because I just see it and I have

4011.83 --> 4022.66
references in my memory experiences okay

4021.25 --> 4026.07
and if you want to make a math formula

4022.66 --> 4026.0699999999997
out of that be my guest

4026.2 --> 4029.31
[Music]

4034.21 --> 4041.23
and by the way I think that sleeping

4038.92 --> 4045.0
warrior that we together at some point

4041.23 --> 4045.0
even did that sort of

4050.44 --> 4057.88
isn't that just renaming gravity no

4053.91 --> 4060.1299999999997
renaming no because gravity is a concept

4057.88 --> 4062.23
that doesn't exist and can't be proven

4060.13 --> 4066.4
and you don't even really know what it

4062.23 --> 4070.859
is anymore nobody does but you can think

4066.4 --> 4070.859
of that you do okay

4074.1 --> 4081.929
[Music]

4086.18 --> 4089.7799999999997
[Music]

4109.62 --> 4113.19
roast chicken

4139.98 --> 4149.5689999999995
right secret Asian man the funny thing

4143.85 --> 4152.609
is you can offset the relative density

4149.569 --> 4155.79
differential because that is practically

4152.609 --> 4157.799
what it is the differential between the

4155.79 --> 4160.23
body the object and its surrounding and

4157.799 --> 4164.549
there's a differential between those

4160.23 --> 4166.5
densities and if they are very far away

4164.549 --> 4170.699
from one another then they're at this

4166.5 --> 4173.73
equilibrium and then the greater that

4170.699 --> 4176.428999999999
rate that of that differential of that

4173.73 --> 4180.0
relative density differential then farce

4176.429 --> 4182.37
force in an exact relation probably

4180.0 --> 4185.779
pretty sure about this will start to

4182.37 --> 4192.66
manifest and start making the object

4185.779 --> 4194.25
accelerate or or even the gas although

4192.66 --> 4196.71
yeah gas do kind of move in all

4194.25 --> 4198.12
direction so it's not well yeah it gas

4196.71 --> 4199.469
in the balloon helium balloon then it's

4198.12 --> 4204.83
enclosed it's not gonna move in all

4199.469 --> 4207.9
direction so much so yeah that that's it

4204.83 --> 4212.13
relative density differential and the

4207.9 --> 4214.349999999999
further it is offset the more relative

4212.13 --> 4219.08
density this equilibrium force will be

4214.35 --> 4219.08
subjected to the object

4223.22 --> 4232.62
this you don't even know what Jupiter is

4230.22 --> 4235.77
and you don't know what the presumed

4232.62 --> 4239.82
moons are it could just be a fractal

4235.77 --> 4242.1
crystal an offset weird side effect from

4239.82 --> 4244.759999999999
the two lights of the moon and the Sun

4242.1 --> 4248.64
the lesser and the greater light and

4244.76 --> 4250.89
could be similarities look the heavens

4248.64 --> 4254.1
are very mysterious but to assume that

4250.89 --> 4257.01
they are giant bodies bigger than the

4254.1 --> 4259.59
earth even that have other bodies that

4257.01 --> 4261.84
orbit around them circle around them

4259.59 --> 4264.72
that's all super presuppositional you

4261.84 --> 4268.29
have no proof of tangibility whatsoever

4264.72 --> 4270.740000000001
about it no proof that any of it is

4268.29 --> 4270.74
tangible

4282.36 --> 4293.5
now Jupiter is alight it's all lights

4285.88 --> 4298.24
all of it even Saturn is a weird little

4293.5 --> 4300.61
half is oval pattern that surrounds it

4298.24 --> 4303.429999999999
seemingly like it is good always is

4300.61 --> 4305.79
visible from the same angle every single

4303.43 --> 4308.4400000000005
time only from that angle

4305.79 --> 4311.11
never is orientated in any other way

4308.44 --> 4315.969999999999
this presupposed is correct that also is

4311.11 --> 4318.339999999999
a very weird light phenomena it's not

4315.97 --> 4322.51
physically literal it's about as

4318.34 --> 4325.0
literally there as the image you see on

4322.51 --> 4331.360000000001
your screen right now is literally there

4325.0 --> 4334.39
in your phone or in on your computers or

4331.36 --> 4340.48
laptop screen wherever you're watching

4334.39 --> 4342.55
this if you're watching this what type

4340.48 --> 4349.349999999999
of light light light Major Tom

4342.55 --> 4349.35
light of the visual kind

4365.47 --> 4370.400000000001
[Music]

4367.99 --> 4376.91
you know I think Nathan Oakley went to

4370.4 --> 4380.12
do something else don't declare any

4376.91 --> 4384.62
victories on yourself just yet oh you

4380.12 --> 4386.66
said like cut there yeah well I don't

4384.62 --> 4389.57
know it comes from those directions

4386.66 --> 4391.88
though seems to have a very specific

4389.57 --> 4394.639999999999
angular relation in relation to the

4391.88 --> 4398.09
position on the earth and over the

4394.64 --> 4400.280000000001
course of time also so yeah that's there

4398.09 --> 4400.85
I don't know how it got there I have

4400.28 --> 4403.58
ideas

4400.85 --> 4405.71
there's just ideas it doesn't mean

4403.58 --> 4408.62
anything you're not gonna get your

4405.71 --> 4412.79
freaking explanation every freaking step

4408.62 --> 4415.28
of the way this is not a Legos building

4412.79 --> 4417.65
block set where you're gonna get the

4415.28 --> 4421.429999999999
full total answer at the end okay I

4417.65 --> 4423.95
don't have it you never had it either

4421.43 --> 4425.87
you're freaking model never had it even

4423.95 --> 4427.429999999999
though people are [ __ ] enough to

4425.87 --> 4431.92
just go with the suspense belief that

4427.43 --> 4436.900000000001
they do have it to just hear people just

4431.92 --> 4439.76
speculate all over the place nonsense

4436.9 --> 4442.82
you don't have the answers nobody has

4439.76 --> 4446.900000000001
all the answers concerning that we don't

4442.82 --> 4449.54
know why and ideas don't mean anything

4446.9 --> 4457.759999999999
without empirical evidence is all just

4449.54 --> 4460.58
more presuppositions yeah Major Tom are

4457.76 --> 4463.76
they are they are holographic images

4460.58 --> 4467.09
they're lights when we look at the

4463.76 --> 4470.06
direction that light comes from we see

4467.09 --> 4473.72
that and that is a holographic effect

4470.06 --> 4476.150000000001
it's a light based apparent visual

4473.72 --> 4479.75
phenomena at the epicenter from which

4476.15 --> 4482.08
that light comes from it is holographic

4479.75 --> 4482.08
Major Tom

4493.0 --> 4501.1
we don't know we don't know get over it

4511.72 --> 4518.68
because they don't shine they don't give

4514.93 --> 4521.83
any hint of physicality jeffrey brown

4518.68 --> 4527.01
volcano mage none of these Holograms you

4521.83 --> 4527.01
love you just want me to use the most

4527.85 --> 4532.450000000001
interpretive leaf physical type of word

4530.71 --> 4534.97
you can get out there so you could just

4532.45 --> 4536.889999999999
stamp all this is so [ __ ] oh it is

4534.97 --> 4544.84
so [ __ ] you just want to do that

4536.89 --> 4547.3
don't you it's not it's just light and

4544.84 --> 4549.1900000000005
we see that and I don't know how it

4547.3 --> 4552.37
manifests but it's not physical because

4549.19 --> 4556.0
you can't approach it when you try it

4552.37 --> 4559.09
bends away that's a very telltale sign

4556.0 --> 4563.62
it's not in any physical location

4559.09 --> 4565.45
literally it's not there just bends away

4563.62 --> 4568.45
so there's the Sun so that's the moon it

4565.45 --> 4571.12
all just bends away it's not there show

4568.45 --> 4575.38
me the proximity show me the approach of

4571.12 --> 4579.43
any of it any of it any celestial body

4575.38 --> 4583.150000000001
do it from the earth non-stop shots

4579.43 --> 4586.0
approach show it show proximity show it

4583.15 --> 4588.49
increased size for real and not just

4586.0 --> 4593.91
more light or whatever note that the

4588.49 --> 4593.91
real approach proven go ahead

[Music]

4604.25 --> 4607.92
[Music]

4617.22 --> 4623.01
yeah the best you can get out of this

4619.9 --> 4626.53
out of all of this recchia life is data

4623.01 --> 4631.18
information information that is set that

4626.53 --> 4635.23
is predictable and that is undone is

4631.18 --> 4637.63
like unpolluted is cleared up from any

4635.23 --> 4640.11
stupid presuppositions about it what

4637.63 --> 4643.63
it's supposed to be nobody cares

4640.11 --> 4644.23
okay only baller religion nutcases care

4643.63 --> 4647.05
about that

4644.23 --> 4649.2699999999995
nobody cares we just want to understand

4647.05 --> 4652.63
how it works and what is really there

4649.27 --> 4656.14
what it is the full spectrum data not

4652.63 --> 4658.150000000001
some some conclusion from some group of

4656.14 --> 4660.1900000000005
people that don't actually then present

4658.15 --> 4663.73
the raw data but only their specific

4660.19 --> 4669.75
narrow conclusions [ __ ] the real data

4663.73 --> 4669.75
that's the best we can get that's it

4670.08 --> 4673.35
figure it out

4675.889 --> 4684.909000000001
oh really Angela attack it's

4680.06 --> 4687.6990000000005
unreasonable proof for the physical what

4684.909 --> 4692.11
get the hell out of here

4687.699 --> 4692.11
that's just your disgusting

4702.969 --> 4709.03
it's nothing unreasonable about

4705.449 --> 4713.32
demanding evidence of a physical nature

4709.03 --> 4716.08
of these things out there that buy all

4713.32 --> 4718.5
our information and data that can be

4716.08 --> 4721.239
deduced is not physical it's just light

4718.5 --> 4725.37
that's the data and the rest is all

4721.239 --> 4725.37
fantasy placed on top of it

4730.81 --> 4733.68
piss off

4760.36 --> 4766.87
a jeffrey Brown folk you know image

4764.38 --> 4770.14
right yeah you don't have to get a

4766.87 --> 4772.36
little naggy like the rest unless you

4770.14 --> 4775.240000000001
just also want to be banned be one of

4772.36 --> 4778.33
the ballers because that's what all

4775.24 --> 4780.25
these freaking [ __ ] ballers do all

4778.33 --> 4782.23
the time they just keep on pushing it

4780.25 --> 4785.02
pushing it and then somebody gets banned

4782.23 --> 4787.12
they all go in a rage and then they also

4785.02 --> 4789.040000000001
have to get banned they have to go too

4787.12 --> 4791.25
far they have to do it because it's

4789.04 --> 4796.48
freaking demons that live in them

4791.25 --> 4804.25
literal it's so much bad behavior it

4796.48 --> 4810.45
becomes an entity by itself it's just a

4804.25 --> 4810.45
hoards yeah ball grab ler

4819.15 --> 4828.78
why Major Tom why are you assuming the

4824.4 --> 4835.0199999999995
heavens are made physically here on

4828.78 --> 4837.65
earth by a mechanism why why would you

4835.02 --> 4837.650000000001
assume that

4843.0 --> 4848.419
[Music]

4850.8 --> 4855.379
[Music]

4858.5 --> 4861.619
[Music]

4865.49 --> 4870.2
I don't even understand why you would

4868.28 --> 4873.11
think this would be impossible when

4870.2 --> 4877.97
there's such a thing in existence like

4873.11 --> 4883.94
genetics and adaptation and all these

4877.97 --> 4886.76
just unbelievably complex and mystical

4883.94 --> 4889.61
designs that are just inherent to this

4886.76 --> 4891.9800000000005
creation and then look I can't imagine

4889.61 --> 4897.29
how some light projection could have

4891.98 --> 4900.0199999999995
been made are you kidding me it's just a

4897.29 --> 4903.08
lamp to God it just put two lamps there

4900.02 --> 4905.6
that's it that's the level of complexity

4903.08 --> 4909.8
that it really is compared to the

4905.6 --> 4911.83
freaking creation of our life okay such

4909.8 --> 4911.83
a

4933.219 --> 4935.82
what

4937.81 --> 4944.47
because they are still there they

4940.87 --> 4950.349999999999
probably are here since the beginning of

4944.47 --> 4952.72
the realm since creation it's there it

4950.35 --> 4956.79
was there from the start Major Tom how

4952.72 --> 4961.89
about that it was there from the start

4956.79 --> 4966.81
before the first human opened their eyes

4961.89 --> 4970.42
with enough conscious to realize that

4966.81 --> 4973.27
things out there are that they were more

4970.42 --> 4976.45
than just beasts you could say or just

4973.27 --> 4978.64
when Adam was put on the earth yeah I'm

4976.45 --> 4984.72
pretty sure that since the very first

4978.64 --> 4987.9400000000005
human being or the very first life-form

4984.72 --> 4990.01
the Sun and the moon were always there

4987.94 --> 4991.98
from the start I'm pretty damn sure of

4990.01 --> 4999.97
it

4991.98 --> 5003.889999999999
whatever mal mal so funny so funny when

4999.97 --> 5003.89
I just try to be sensible about things

5005.37 --> 5008.5199999999995
[Music]

5010.64 --> 5018.02
what well what is the lunar eclipse you

5014.42 --> 5022.0
know what kind of obstruction would

5018.02 --> 5027.35
cause a shadow that is actually

5022.0 --> 5030.14
technically smaller than the object

5027.35 --> 5032.3
concealing it which yeah that that's

5030.14 --> 5034.64
kind of what you think it is on the

5032.3 --> 5037.25
globe right it's this big thingy out

5034.64 --> 5038.96
there this ball then another big ball

5037.25 --> 5042.65
shines light on that well how can that

5038.96 --> 5045.46
then give this mini shadow it doesn't

5042.65 --> 5045.46
really make any sense

5047.23 --> 5052.16
so yeah what is an eclipse it is a

5050.45 --> 5055.7
change in the light

5052.16 --> 5059.18
now whatever manifests that light to

5055.7 --> 5060.889999999999
spring forth from that angular location

5059.18 --> 5063.47
in relation to the observer whatever

5060.89 --> 5067.160000000001
causes that to spring forth may be

5063.47 --> 5070.58
guided by another system that for

5067.16 --> 5073.93
example has just like a mechanism to me

5070.58 --> 5076.25
I always conceptualize the actual

5073.93 --> 5078.83
mechanism of the heavens that it would

5076.25 --> 5080.81
be installed in a higher dimension yeah

5078.83 --> 5084.5199999999995
and that's all super fuzzy has nothing

5080.81 --> 5087.2300000000005
to do with empirical science it's my

5084.52 --> 5090.38
extra dimensional view of it that it is

5087.23 --> 5093.62
a mechanism that is literally the whole

5090.38 --> 5095.72
is being covered like a bowl going in

5093.62 --> 5097.67
front of a cave exit and the light

5095.72 --> 5099.320000000001
shines into the cave and that gives off

5097.67 --> 5104.0
the light and then something moves in

5099.32 --> 5105.62
front of it and then it's closed that's

5104.0 --> 5111.59
what it looks like to me and seem so

5105.62 --> 5115.61
very mechanical cuz I don't know why it

5111.59 --> 5118.46
is weird but yeah just these sheer

5115.61 --> 5120.53
appearances of so many of the celestial

5118.46 --> 5123.02
bodies are surreal by themselves they

5120.53 --> 5127.58
are weird it is very weird that Saturn

5123.02 --> 5131.240000000001
has this this interpretable ring at this

5127.58 --> 5134.8099999999995
specific angle always that angle why and

5131.24 --> 5137.54
the moon with with all its weird

5134.81 --> 5140.150000000001
features that can easily be interpreted

5137.54 --> 5143.24
as creators and this in that that

5140.15 --> 5144.24
terminated line going over it blackening

5143.24 --> 5147.51
things out and Eve

5144.24 --> 5150.54
and emphasizing kind of crater-like

5147.51 --> 5154.47
features this is super surreal I don't

5150.54 --> 5157.16
know why it works like that why the

5154.47 --> 5172.95
light manifest like that I don't know

5157.16 --> 5174.8099999999995
all I know is that it is light yes

5172.95 --> 5181.2
conspiracy cats I have looked at the

5174.81 --> 5183.6900000000005
moon with a dad let's go I also looked

5181.2 --> 5186.139999999999
at the moon with the p900 it's much

5183.69 --> 5186.139999999999
clearer

5193.26 --> 5199.5
all right well Robin Stanley from a

5195.54 --> 5202.98
designer's perspective definitely from a

5199.5 --> 5204.96
designer's perspective yes something

5202.98 --> 5208.139999999999
like that out there can definitely be

5204.96 --> 5211.56
created for beauty purposes so just

5208.14 --> 5212.76
think of the amazing clear skies when

5211.56 --> 5218.1900000000005
all the stars come out it's super

5212.76 --> 5220.56
beautiful it feels kind of epic because

5218.19 --> 5223.86
it was probably made as a design feature

5220.56 --> 5227.370000000001
and seconding as a clock of course as as

5223.86 --> 5230.28
a rhythm guide and of course then

5227.37 --> 5232.89
there's the seasons and all that so it

5230.28 --> 5234.87
has a cyclical function it has this

5232.89 --> 5238.92
energy introduction function the

5234.87 --> 5240.78
interaction with matter heating things

5238.92 --> 5244.83
up and yeah

5240.78 --> 5246.78
adding to the cycle of life and it had

5244.83 --> 5251.73
this rhythm function and it is been it's

5246.78 --> 5253.65
very beautiful but distracting it's very

5251.73 --> 5255.74
mysterious some of these features when

5253.65 --> 5260.759999999999
you look up close and that is really

5255.74 --> 5263.3099999999995
distracting it makes you imagine like is

5260.76 --> 5269.1900000000005
it something else it's look so much like

5263.31 --> 5271.14
this and yeah then you can become a

5269.19 --> 5274.83
lunatic and I think that a lot of people

5271.14 --> 5278.88
were probably lunatics before the globe

5274.83 --> 5281.7
model was even society introduced I bet

5278.88 --> 5284.43
that a lot of Globus before that all

5281.7 --> 5288.63
happened were literally moon worshipers

5284.43 --> 5291.12
because the moon was so convincingly a

5288.63 --> 5292.9800000000005
ball in space that is the ultimate

5291.12 --> 5295.11
visual proof to start out with say they

5292.98 --> 5297.209999999999
went with that [ __ ] for a while on the

5295.11 --> 5301.049999999999
ground start to make their little plans

5297.21 --> 5307.47
and then it's like oh the moon landing

5301.05 --> 5311.070000000001
and now it's really real really so we

5307.47 --> 5312.87
can now all go with that crazy idea it's

5311.07 --> 5314.759999999999
all spinning balls going through this

5312.87 --> 5318.39
fast outer space with no detectable

5314.76 --> 5320.85
motion whatsoever and yeah then it's a

5318.39 --> 5323.01
ball in the first place although yeah

5320.85 --> 5325.17
people can be convinced slightly easier

5323.01 --> 5326.909000000001
of that since some of yeah most of these

5325.17 --> 5329.88
celestial bodies

5326.909 --> 5333.54
the light side effects present them self

5329.88 --> 5336.9890000000005
circular and that is easy to think of as

5333.54 --> 5338.4
a glow so that part is less stuff to

5336.989 --> 5341.61
think of the earth as a globe it's

5338.4 --> 5343.62
easier to presuppose despite the insane

5341.61 --> 5346.86
long sides but yeah most people don't go

5343.62 --> 5347.37
for that they don't they don't seek that

5346.86 --> 5349.469
out

5347.37 --> 5352.98
they don't look into the distance very

5349.469 --> 5357.86
well just stick their computer screens

5352.98 --> 5357.86
are to their whatever they do

5390.369 --> 5394.299999999999
right well Rukiya life in a way the Sun

5392.98 --> 5397.869
does do that

5394.3 --> 5399.88
but that's only because the Sun is not

5397.869 --> 5403.54
in any literal position but there is

5399.88 --> 5406.179
this weird spherical angular relation

5403.54 --> 5408.639
with the daylight manifestation and I do

5406.179 --> 5410.349
think that sometimes Sun does appear to

5408.639 --> 5413.4400000000005
shine from the other side but that's

5410.349 --> 5416.05
because it's not literally a light

5413.44 --> 5418.388999999999
source in a specific location doing that

5416.05 --> 5420.909000000001
it's only the angular location in

5418.389 --> 5423.849
relation to the observer so how they

5420.909 --> 5425.888999999999
seal I distribute from their position

5423.849 --> 5428.67
it's going to be extremely different

5425.889 --> 5431.83
from somebody a few hundred miles away

5428.67 --> 5433.869
looking at the same features at the same

5431.83 --> 5435.28
clouds at the same landscape features

5433.869 --> 5438.549999999999
it's going to look different the lights

5435.28 --> 5443.679
not gonna shine on it the same way looks

5438.55 --> 5448.03
different because it's not light coming

5443.679 --> 5451.599
from a specific location it's different

5448.03 --> 5454.0
for every location the light is

5451.599 --> 5456.46
conditionally relational to the

5454.0 --> 5460.69
observers position as to how it presents

5456.46 --> 5466.92
itself on the land it's weird

5460.69 --> 5466.919999999999
is holographic it's testable

5466.959 --> 5473.179
crepuscular rays are one of the best

5469.669 --> 5476.329
examples to prove this because

5473.179 --> 5480.079
crepuscular rays will be visible from a

5476.329 --> 5482.929
certain position to the the person

5480.079 --> 5485.449
seeing that and then somebody else will

5482.929 --> 5487.969
be a hundred miles away looking at those

5485.449 --> 5490.848999999999
same cloud formations and they will not

5487.969 --> 5494.269
see those prosecutor rays hitting things

5490.849 --> 5497.78
because to their location the Sun is in

5494.269 --> 5504.399
another angle and it's not going through

5497.78 --> 5504.398999999999
those clouds yeah try to explain that

5511.91 --> 5514.8099999999995
go ahead

5523.9 --> 5530.589999999999
yeah weird isn't it conspiracy cats it

5529.84 --> 5537.9400000000005
is weird

5530.59 --> 5541.21
the world is surreal but that doesn't

5537.94 --> 5547.419999999999
mean that we can't get the data details

5541.21 --> 5550.83
right eventually I get all the remaining

5547.42 --> 5550.83
misunderstandings out of the way

5569.929 --> 5574.76
oh really conspiracy cats do you have an

5572.42 --> 5577.46
alternative explanation as to what I

5574.76 --> 5582.070000000001
just say why prep us kill arrays right

5577.46 --> 5584.78
manifests at a specific location with

5582.07 --> 5587.389999999999
touchdowns visible and everything and

5584.78 --> 5596.239
then from another location it's not like

5587.39 --> 5598.58
that try to explain that for me I'd like

5596.239 --> 5601.19
to hear that alternative explanation I

5598.58 --> 5604.429
don't think that anyone on the ball side

5601.19 --> 5607.669999999999
has ever even attempted that and wisely

5604.429 --> 5609.9490000000005
so because you have to get really ball

5607.67 --> 5612.76
[ __ ] crazy to try to explain that way in

5609.949 --> 5612.759999999999
the heliocentric model

5620.19 --> 5625.65
now Larry to March that is not the

5623.04 --> 5627.89
response that is not a response that's

5625.65 --> 5630.389999999999
bypassing the claim that's a red herring

5627.89 --> 5633.33
now I'm talking about the crepuscular

5630.39 --> 5635.67
rays not your spherical presupposition

5633.33 --> 5637.5599999999995
as to how the sunlight Direction relates

5635.67 --> 5641.07
to the presupposed spherical earth

5637.56 --> 5647.39
position now not that no the actual

5641.07 --> 5647.389999999999
visual phenomena as it manifests yeah

5647.45 --> 5651.83
so don't try to red-herring me buddy

5670.46 --> 5676.7390000000005
no conspiracy cats that is save that

5674.94 --> 5680.759999999999
know that sorry

5676.739 --> 5683.629999999999
that's absolutely not a comparable

5680.76 --> 5687.51
example now we're not talking about

5683.63 --> 5689.21
confirmed physical things and then oh it

5687.51 --> 5692.4490000000005
looks different from a different person

5689.21 --> 5694.89
but this case I'm talking about light

5692.449 --> 5697.589999999999
phenomena relating to the Sun

5694.89 --> 5702.150000000001
crepuscular rays and their visual

5697.59 --> 5704.610000000001
touchdown yeah that's what I'm talking

5702.15 --> 5707.219
about not something actually proven

5704.61 --> 5710.28
physical okay talking about that light

5707.219 --> 5712.02
the sunlight the daylight coming through

5710.28 --> 5715.5
those clouds in those patterns and

5712.02 --> 5719.280000000001
visibly hitting objects that line up

5715.5 --> 5720.57
locally and then you go away or you have

5719.28 --> 5722.639999999999
somebody else a hundred miles away

5720.57 --> 5725.009999999999
looking at that same cloud formation and

5722.64 --> 5726.75
guess what those beams are not coming

5725.01 --> 5730.35
out of there they are not hitting those

5726.75 --> 5732.32
objects the Sun is actually in a

5730.35 --> 5739.29
different position for that observer

5732.32 --> 5740.88
yeah so try to explain that please no

5739.29 --> 5743.31
it's not a comparable example it's

5740.88 --> 5746.1
there's nothing to do with it one is

5743.31 --> 5748.9800000000005
light the other is confirmed physical

5746.1 --> 5751.02
objects we're not talking about visual

5748.98 --> 5752.849999999999
perspective on confirmed objects

5751.02 --> 5758.42
conspiracy cats we're talking about

5752.85 --> 5762.26
light phenomena observable film about

5758.42 --> 5762.26
light phenomena

5763.659 --> 5769.54
no no conspiracy cats it's absolutely

5767.5 --> 5772.33
not comparable I just explained it to

5769.54 --> 5775.53
you if you don't cease and desist your

5772.33 --> 5779.219
nonsense claim right now I'm banning you

5775.53 --> 5783.58
but if you wish to continue to actually

5779.219 --> 5785.2300000000005
go without what I said and try to find

5783.58 --> 5789.5199999999995
some alternative evidence for

5785.23 --> 5792.489
crepuscular rays not freaking train

5789.52 --> 5796.330000000001
tracks or anything physical then you can

5792.489 --> 5799.12
stay if you're gonna say that your false

5796.33 --> 5801.909
equivalence example of railroad tracks

5799.12 --> 5804.04
from different angles perceives that

5801.909 --> 5807.21
that is a good example it's not and if

5804.04 --> 5807.21

5838.51 --> 5842.619000000001
going to inquire as to how this

5841.06 --> 5846.09
phenomena should work on the

5842.619 --> 5860.369
heliocentric model the crepuscular rays

5846.09 --> 5860.369000000001
