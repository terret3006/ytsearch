[Music]

36.59 --> 43.77
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

40.5 --> 45.629
early-bird number 288 I'm your host

43.77 --> 47.370000000000005
Arwen and before we start to show please

45.629 --> 49.5
don't forget to share it on any platform

47.37 --> 51.329
you deem fit and also if you haven't

49.5 --> 52.949
already subscribed to my channel and hit

51.329 --> 54.96
the bell notification so you know when

52.949 --> 57.3
I'm going live which is normally 2:00

54.96 --> 59.01
p.m. Amsterdam time every day also

57.3 --> 60.93
please support my show through the super

59.01 --> 62.519
Chad's paypal patreon and my GoFundMe

60.93 --> 66.75
that would be much appreciated

62.519 --> 73.89
so today the weather is still kind of

66.75 --> 79.91
hot but it's weird it's misty its moist

73.89 --> 83.49
I guess it's a little less hot inside

79.91 --> 87.08
because yeah I'm still wearing my

83.49 --> 87.08
t-shirt I thought I could handle it

93.09 --> 100.229
yeah I'm doing really well actually no

96.02 --> 103.74
although I had a bit of a fit over at

100.229 --> 105.45
the early bird chat on myself because

103.74 --> 110.85
that's what typically tends to happen

105.45 --> 116.64
when I really can after a long period of

110.85 --> 120.96
fog I feel so much better like now I'm

116.64 --> 124.02
taking the the probiotics one in the

120.96 --> 125.33999999999999
morning and one in the evening and I

124.02 --> 128.759
wasn't sick at all

125.34 --> 130.649
today just nothing and woke up was

128.759 --> 132.69
really had a lot of energy a lot of

130.649 --> 136.049
focus I immediately started doing things

132.69 --> 138.54
that even while it's hot and that I

136.049 --> 142.709
really hasn't happened for over at least

138.54 --> 144.51
a week and then I start to realize all

142.709 --> 148.31900000000002
kinds of things I was bumping my head

144.51 --> 151.2
into constantly and now I just know what

148.319 --> 153.17999999999998
that was and how stupid I basically

151.2 --> 157.28
responded but that at the same time I

153.18 --> 157.28
was just [ __ ] so I couldn't see it

160.58 --> 168.41000000000003
so yeah I hope this persists because I

164.51 --> 171.59
really need to be sharp I really need to

168.41 --> 173.35999999999999
be sharp if I want to successfully keep

171.59 --> 175.91
on building because I can keep on doing

173.36 --> 178.79000000000002
what I do and that kind of seems to work

175.91 --> 180.5
anyway no matter what my status once I

178.79 --> 182.45
start to focus I figure out new things

180.5 --> 186.83
about flattered at their science and

182.45 --> 190.92999999999998
it's really good but I need to do more

186.83 --> 193.94000000000003
than that I also need to build I need to

190.93 --> 197.27
for example one of my biggest regrets

193.94 --> 197.72
and it's even stupid that I can call it

197.27 --> 201.77
that

197.72 --> 205.19
is that I haven't kept track of videos I

201.77 --> 207.83
haven't said taken samples of good

205.19 --> 209.93
things that I saw and downloaded it and

207.83 --> 212.45000000000002
put it somewhere to categorize it so I

209.93 --> 214.64000000000001
could find it back and there's just no

212.45 --> 218.51
excuse for me why I haven't started

214.64 --> 224.17999999999998
doing that I must do that and I must

218.51 --> 225.04999999999998
really like stop waving it away for a

224.18 --> 231.709
weird

225.05 --> 235.52
ethereal reason that it's not compatible

231.709 --> 238.55
with what I am doing now it might have

235.52 --> 241.16
been suitable for the way that I angled

238.55 --> 244.76000000000002
getting into this well that's not the

241.16 --> 248.9
same situation anymore I thought I don't

244.76 --> 252.32
know I was when I got into Flat Earth I

248.9 --> 255.05
was still very terrified of things in

252.32 --> 258.02
the past and I thought it was probably

255.05 --> 262.16
gonna end very quickly so I just thought

258.02 --> 266.14
that it's no use anyway but that turns

262.16 --> 269.09000000000003
out to just be not true it's not true

266.14 --> 274.47999999999996
it's gonna keep on going and I must just

269.09 --> 277.75
do this so it's almost like my ego

274.48 --> 282.47
subconsciously tricked me

277.75 --> 286.04
in order to downgrade my competence in

282.47 --> 288.61
this world and that infuriates me when I

286.04 --> 288.61
realize that

290.85 --> 298.63
but yeah one thing is useless it's

293.8 --> 300.85
getting angry angry at your own ego so

298.63 --> 304.98
the only way to really resolve it is to

300.85 --> 307.51000000000005
just adapt as quickly as possible

304.98 --> 309.67
stop making that mistake and stop

307.51 --> 313.33
complaining about it when I can actually

309.67 --> 316.84000000000003
do something about it I can never make

313.33 --> 318.78999999999996
be as good as I could have been but at

316.84 --> 321.54999999999995
least I've learned and I could still

318.79 --> 325.48
make up for it it's silly comparison

321.55 --> 328.6
that it's kind of like D&D if the a

325.48 --> 330.64000000000004
party is at a pretty high level and you

328.6 --> 333.01000000000005
enter for some reason as a lower-level

330.64 --> 334.39
character you think oh I'm never gonna

333.01 --> 337.05
be as strong as them but there's

334.39 --> 340.15
actually in the rules funny enough

337.05 --> 344.23
because you're behind you also get more

340.15 --> 346.15
experience from it so I'm gonna take on

344.23 --> 349.21000000000004
the mindset that that is going to be the

346.15 --> 352.33
case that I will be able to make up for

349.21 --> 354.72999999999996
it so that my ego is not gonna whip me

352.33 --> 358.38
all the time for ya see you didn't do it

354.73 --> 358.38
good enough I fooled you

359.22 --> 365.59000000000003
so yeah a bit of mm inner turmoil but I

363.67 --> 372.6
think much in a much more productive way

365.59 --> 376.03
now so I may be a bit rambley mm I got

372.6 --> 377.89000000000004
Tamara coffee with me tea although I

376.03 --> 381.92999999999995
don't know how much of it I'm gonna be

377.89 --> 386.68
taking the tangerine and again

381.93 --> 389.71
Illuminati Chris oh all intact because

386.68 --> 393.76
this tactic I'm going shopping

389.71 --> 396.60999999999996
one o'clock it kind of works that way I

393.76 --> 400.419
don't can't accidentally eat it before

396.61 --> 404.02000000000004
the show starts so

400.419 --> 405.59
okay I'm gonna take a look at chat now I

404.02 --> 412.06899999999996
was there

405.59 --> 413.71
hey GM was there a first Steve saari

412.069 --> 417.849
tech Cosentino

413.71 --> 423.88899999999995
CGI Randy brand I'm good to see you

417.849 --> 432.87899999999996
over mu cool Fyodor Dostoevsky much

423.889 --> 432.879
Alice mist talk Michael is that tapi

433.03 --> 440.59
Ragnar Stefan elder son

435.969 --> 440.59
yeah good to see you all

445.719 --> 453.93
so

448.41 --> 457.20000000000005
all right what have I been up to yeah

453.93 --> 461.96
joined the debates through Skype and was

457.2 --> 461.96
fine wasn't all that active really

467.37 --> 473.52
was a lot happening what did I watch

469.65 --> 476.35999999999996
again let me guess

473.52 --> 476.35999999999996
look through it

476.52 --> 487.10999999999996
I know I ended the night with a really

482.22 --> 491.52000000000004
late hangout for from from Paula Bible

487.11 --> 494.49
literalist about Babylon and I thought I

491.52 --> 496.59
was really I don't know it was a snippet

494.49 --> 502.919
it was really good and I totally agree

496.59 --> 505.5
it's one of the things like some things

502.919 --> 507.419
about the Bible are symbolic but it is

505.5 --> 509.16
kind of clear that they are you just got

507.419 --> 513.659
to pay attention and some things are

509.16 --> 517.5600000000001
quite literal and I love how Paula's

513.659 --> 521.539
just putting so much focus to it that

517.56 --> 524.43
she really gets that it and also I I

521.539 --> 528.38
don't know you know we've had friction

524.43 --> 531.3
in the past some issues both of us I

528.38 --> 536.42
kind of poke her in in the wrong way and

531.3 --> 536.42
retrospect I noticed that

539.68 --> 543.9989999999999
it's not only one way to put I noticed

541.749 --> 548.41
that she's really improved

543.999 --> 552.339
she's seemed to have started to contain

548.41 --> 556.269
certain issues he had and his even her

552.339 --> 559.089
radiance is slightly different and

556.269 --> 562.569
lighter it's good I'm really impressed

559.089 --> 566.4390000000001
by just by the way she looked and their

562.569 --> 569.11
attitude and I'm really I'm think I'm

566.439 --> 571.8389999999999
gonna keep following her again because

569.11 --> 579.249
it was it was very pleasant to watch

571.839 --> 582.73
that and very informative right yeah a

579.249 --> 586.2090000000001
gem and she is a wise woman but she's

582.73 --> 591.399
also a wise woman with like personal

586.209 --> 596.649
issues and she's really she's really I'm

591.399 --> 599.529
really impressed so and I I don't say

596.649 --> 604.41
that too often about people but in this

599.529 --> 604.41
case I thought it was worth noteworthy

606.53 --> 609.6999999999999
[Music]

613.7 --> 622.34
right and Paula also knows the issues

617.48 --> 624.59
with Christians and bashing people over

622.34 --> 626.8100000000001
the head with a Bible she gets that and

624.59 --> 630.8000000000001
that's also something I really respect

626.81 --> 634.3699999999999
about her because she's had her own like

630.8 --> 636.4399999999999
even if you're a very pure Bible study

634.37 --> 639.08
or like she is even then you get hit

636.44 --> 644.57
over the head by other Christians but

639.08 --> 648.0200000000001
know better somehow and and yeah it's

644.57 --> 650.45
that that switchboard mindset where the

648.02 --> 652.76
person basically assigns themselves to

650.45 --> 654.4100000000001
be deciding for everybody whether they

652.76 --> 656.75
go to heaven or hell based on what

654.41 --> 658.9399999999999
they're doing and it's just a silly game

656.75 --> 663.44
it doesn't lead anywhere and she gets

658.94 --> 664.6
that it's much more complicated than

663.44 --> 667.4300000000001
that

664.6 --> 669.98
and much more about just personal

667.43 --> 672.17
understanding and and resolving your own

669.98 --> 674.69
issues and she's doing it as well it's

672.17 --> 678.5899999999999
just I don't know okay enough gushing

674.69 --> 680.0300000000001
about that but yeah subscribe to Bible

678.59 --> 681.8000000000001
literalist it's a good channel

680.03 --> 684.1999999999999
especially if you want to know details

681.8 --> 692.4499999999999
about Christianity a lot of material a

684.2 --> 694.6400000000001
lot of work she's done so far alright so

692.45 --> 697.45
let's get back to more flat earth

694.64 --> 700.48
orientations

697.45 --> 704.08
all right Effie cars attack on slice

700.48 --> 704.65
Channel well maybe it's the other way

704.08 --> 708.88
around

704.65 --> 710.98
and maybe Effie core just takes stupid

708.88 --> 713.86
baller slander a little bit more serious

710.98 --> 717.69
because they have more invested that is

713.86 --> 720.4300000000001
at risk when you do that it's not just

717.69 --> 723.82
general you like like I for example

720.43 --> 727.5699999999999
ignore it because like how how can I

723.82 --> 730.3900000000001
even approach all this nonsense it'll be

727.57 --> 734.59
three lifetime jobs to do that by now

730.39 --> 738.1899999999999
just all I can do is just respond in a

734.59 --> 740.58
moment and don't pay it to mighty much

738.19 --> 740.58
attention

740.94 --> 745.6300000000001
yeah controlled by who

743.07 --> 749.59
mister who's probably gonna get banned

745.63 --> 753.13
pretty soon you're fact fact okay so

749.59 --> 763.32
present your fact quickly

753.13 --> 763.32
in chat hello sx0 oh my god

765.56 --> 775.93
you know Eve he actually explained that

768.47 --> 779.27
did you know that must be pretty dumb

775.93 --> 782.0799999999999
and you know it out check it out check

779.27 --> 782.0799999999999
are you good

791.45 --> 797.2900000000001
oh you're one of those you're a real

795.02 --> 797.29
creep

802.029 --> 810.99
like flattered at the reset yes yeah

806.889 --> 810.99
this is a good luck with that bye

820.22 --> 829.26
right yeah look if if sly hadn't done

827.58 --> 834.9000000000001
something wrong then he couldn't have

829.26 --> 837.3
been striked really you know it's just

834.9 --> 840.27
that Effie core tends to not ignore

837.3 --> 845.01
things when they go too far when ballers

840.27 --> 846.72
get to to assured of themselves that

845.01 --> 848.91
they can just say anything and then they

846.72 --> 852.11
strike back because they're prepared for

848.91 --> 857.36
that stuff and yeah they're very serious

852.11 --> 857.36
so I'm not surprised

865.92 --> 869.04
[Music]

873.75 --> 881.399
hmm our room Thorsen he isn't exactly a

878.959 --> 884.1289999999999
sock because he does have a lot of

881.399 --> 887.91
videos but it's all just slandering [ __ ]

884.129 --> 895.49
so he's just like flat earth reset does

887.91 --> 902.509
obsessed freaks downward spiraling gamma

895.49 --> 902.509
fountain of fountain a poo disgusting

919.42 --> 925.2299999999999
oh okay that loves whatever I don't know

922.9 --> 925.23
who it is

930.03 --> 935.6999999999999
yeah Ragnar Stefan he'll listen what I

933.34 --> 940.24
understood from what was talked about

935.7 --> 944.5
the he basically slandered them by

940.24 --> 948.78
calling a lot of things fraudulent which

944.5 --> 955.84
is absolutely provably not the case and

948.78 --> 958.24
they picked him up on that gosh you can

955.84 --> 960.4
say all kinds of things and then accuses

958.24 --> 963.36
Hillary or nonsense stories but if

960.4 --> 967.24
you're gonna literally say a setup is

963.36 --> 971.08
scientifically fraud then that crosses a

967.24 --> 974.79
certain line and that's that's why they

971.08 --> 974.7900000000001
responded as far as I understand

983.149 --> 989.379
I thought maybe if Karen B would come on

985.939 --> 995.949
maybe talk about it that would be cool

989.379 --> 995.9490000000001
but don't see your online

1024.36 --> 1027.049
and

1045.55 --> 1058.75
so yeah I'm up I'm up for talking about

1052.94 --> 1058.75
Flat Earth or some science thing

1074.68 --> 1088.45
Oh Zep tepi yeah you're wrong okay their

1084.28 --> 1090.07
faces maybe on their website publicly

1088.45 --> 1096.28
but that doesn't mean that it's not

1090.07 --> 1099.01
copyrighted so yeah I think you you got

1096.28 --> 1101.55
it wrong if they don't have a case this

1099.01 --> 1101.55
wouldn't have happened

1106.02 --> 1113.11
look this whole ranty issue is kind of

1110.62 --> 1116.53
calmed down now so you can stop trying

1113.11 --> 1120.9399999999998
to troll me with apologies to Randy

1116.53 --> 1123.37
because I really over reacted against

1120.94 --> 1127.15
peanuts Clark the other day which was

1123.37 --> 1128.02
very specifically because I thought he

1127.15 --> 1130.99
would know better

1128.02 --> 1134.8899999999999
it wasn't even because of that question

1130.99 --> 1138.19
okay I know most of you like you you

1134.89 --> 1140.1100000000001
troll sucklings you're parasites that

1138.19 --> 1142.72
like to stick on anything you think I'll

1140.11 --> 1146.86
catch on I know you don't get that

1142.72 --> 1149.26
because you are [ __ ] [ __ ] so just

1146.86 --> 1153.3999999999999
keep on trying dumbass

1149.26 --> 1157.89
it's not gonna work cuz that rage was

1153.4 --> 1157.89
not about that question idiots

1177.149 --> 1179.809
right

1184.609 --> 1195.6789999999999
a flat earth organization well I don't

1192.559 --> 1199.1589999999999
know about that look they have legal

1195.679 --> 1201.049
standing they have registered thing I

1199.159 --> 1203.1190000000001
don't is that an organization or is it a

1201.049 --> 1204.9189999999999
company I don't know I haven't really

1203.119 --> 1207.7389999999998
looked into the details I probably

1204.919 --> 1209.929
should have but I'm always like oh no

1207.739 --> 1211.279
let's just leave that to others yeah and

1209.929 --> 1215.1490000000001
I'm gonna stop doing that I'm gonna

1211.279 --> 1220.369
freakin pay attention from now on but I

1215.149 --> 1225.619
don't know why would it be a slander

1220.369 --> 1227.779
look if you called them I didn't know a

1225.619 --> 1230.329
mega corporation or something now that

1227.779 --> 1232.759
might be almost kind of slanderous and

1230.329 --> 1237.259
ridiculous especially if they are not

1232.759 --> 1239.45
and don't have that but even slandered

1237.259 --> 1241.749
would just be very miss informative I

1239.45 --> 1241.749
don't know

1247.62 --> 1252.8999999999999
yeah I bet you do yes i Rita Cosentino

1251.279 --> 1255.75
but that's not gonna happen because I'm

1252.9 --> 1257.49
never gonna join this card to my own

1255.75 --> 1260.61
frustration it's one of the things I'm

1257.49 --> 1262.89
gonna have to stick to just like I did

1260.61 --> 1271.6789999999999
with Facebook with Facebook I don't

1262.89 --> 1273.5700000000002
really regret it apparently I am just

1271.679 --> 1277.71
gonna have to do things pretty narrow

1273.57 --> 1284.49
and it kind of sucks because you don't

1277.71 --> 1290.549
grow as fast but I trust that it's for a

1284.49 --> 1295.07
reason not just my ego screwing with me

1290.549 --> 1295.07
again hey Karen

1304.13 --> 1317.9
yeah can we have people in chatters come

1307.64 --> 1321.669
Cynthia what I I have no idea and it's

1317.9 --> 1321.669
just news

1331.14 --> 1343.5
yeah there was probably better yeah yeah

1335.8 --> 1346.3
thank you for that Karen B thought so um

1343.5 --> 1348.49
but yeah we were talking about people in

1346.3 --> 1351.28
chat we're really curious about the

1348.49 --> 1356.65
whole issue with slice risk sparking and

1351.28 --> 1360.85
the Fe core issue so if you want or if

1356.65 --> 1363.0700000000002
you would like to could you call me up

1360.85 --> 1365.86
on skype and maybe talk about it on the

1363.07 --> 1367.72
show or just if you want you know you

1365.86 --> 1372.52
don't have to you can say something

1367.72 --> 1377.3700000000001
about in chat as well but there seems to

1372.52 --> 1382.35
be some questions going around as to

1377.37 --> 1382.35
what exactly the details are and

1389.02 --> 1392.25
a mason bee

1398.789 --> 1401.389
what

1404.19 --> 1407.19
right

1407.91 --> 1414.23
don't know how you are probably the same

1411.87 --> 1414.2299999999998
role

1416.32 --> 1419.53
[Music]

1422.46 --> 1431.45
okay well Cerreto Cosentino to be fair

1427.679 --> 1434.19
I'm a slightly tired of people

1431.45 --> 1437.46
complaining to me about how terrible

1434.19 --> 1440.6390000000001
discord is when I specifically swore

1437.46 --> 1447.269
never to go to this card it's like yeah

1440.639 --> 1449.809
that's not really my problem but I feel

1447.269 --> 1449.809
for you

1459.429 --> 1468.5800000000002
anyway Karen if you wish we could talk

1462.789 --> 1471.669
about it on skype about the situation

1468.58 --> 1477.1899999999998
with slice bar Cain getting struck on

1471.669 --> 1480.179
YouTube by Fe core to clear the up what

1477.19 --> 1480.179
was going on there

1509.5 --> 1512.619
[Music]

1540.71 --> 1549.169
well Cerrito Cosentino I appreciate the

1545.149 --> 1552.2589999999998
sentiment but if my intelligence is

1549.169 --> 1556.039
needed there and then they'll they're

1552.259 --> 1558.49
gonna have to come to me because I'm not

1556.039 --> 1558.49
going there

1577.76 --> 1584.36
right is it because it is because is

1580.64 --> 1587.21
flat well it's not what all globe ads do

1584.36 --> 1590.8999999999999
but it's what the vast majority of them

1587.21 --> 1593.51
do D especially the simple guys like Don

1590.9 --> 1598.16
they're just copycats they just copy

1593.51 --> 1602.27
what they chose to trust as it were that

1598.16 --> 1607.76
is of what they do mostly but the really

1602.27 --> 1611.12
while the more studied ones they're more

1607.76 --> 1614.51
actively aware of the material and and

1611.12 --> 1617.1499999999999
its problems without let it they

1614.51 --> 1620.6
consider it a problem not as they actual

1617.15 --> 1624.5
disproof so they've been working to

1620.6 --> 1627.77
basically try to stop the wounds find

1624.5 --> 1629.81
mechanisms to talk around it to bypass

1627.77 --> 1631.25
it somehow that is what they occupy

1629.81 --> 1634.27
themselves with so it's a little bit

1631.25 --> 1637.43
more complicated than simple copycatting

1634.27 --> 1639.53
although even basic ballers that kind of

1637.43 --> 1644.0600000000002
want to step up to the plate even more

1639.53 --> 1646.61
they do copy those techniques from the

1644.06 --> 1648.74
more well studied ballers it is that is

1646.61 --> 1653.05
correct

1648.74 --> 1653.05
hi yeah Karen Beach Skype indeed

1660.96 --> 1664.779
[Music]

1664.999 --> 1670.529
hey Karen I hope my play black page

1669.989 --> 1675.1190000000001
sorry

1670.529 --> 1680.669
okay oh I couldn't hear it so well not

1675.119 --> 1683.629
yet right so hey how are you doing this

1680.669 --> 1690.1490000000001
morning it's pretty early there right um

1683.629 --> 1692.9089999999999
yes it's 8:30 a.m. how are you doing

1690.149 --> 1698.4789999999998
good better better than the last few

1692.909 --> 1701.1290000000001
weeks this well that's good to know yeah

1698.479 --> 1703.259
yeah I've been taking uh some I

1701.129 --> 1705.4499999999998
basically tried to figure out what was

1703.259 --> 1707.6390000000001
going on because I kind of was feeling

1705.45 --> 1710.039
sick in the mornings like constantly a

1707.639 --> 1712.6789999999999
very prolonged period and then I would

1710.039 --> 1715.139
kind of get over it halfway the day and

1712.679 --> 1717.509
also constantly correlated with the heat

1715.139 --> 1720.9889999999998
so first I was just thinking it's just

1717.509 --> 1724.049
the heat but then I concluded that I

1720.989 --> 1725.729
wasn't properly absorbing my food and

1724.049 --> 1729.629
the supplements because I just didn't

1725.729 --> 1731.97
feel the normal positive boost from them

1729.629 --> 1735.119
as much so I figured that okay my

1731.97 --> 1737.849
probiotics if my system is just damaged

1735.119 --> 1741.2099999999998
somehow through stress or an accidental

1737.849 --> 1744.059
over taking alcohol or the enormous heat

1741.21 --> 1746.909
and now that I've started taking it for

1744.059 --> 1749.759
two days suddenly it's like I'm I really

1746.909 --> 1750.6290000000001
bad and back what the hell's happened in

1749.759 --> 1758.909
the last few weeks

1750.629 --> 1763.59
oof so and how have you been I've been

1758.909 --> 1764.3090000000002
good been very busy very busy all right

1763.59 --> 1767.519
as usual

1764.309 --> 1772.289
it never ends but earth is so lit right

1767.519 --> 1774.33
now so lit yeah on fire you mean yeah

1772.289 --> 1775.83
yeah it's just busy there's a lot going

1774.33 --> 1777.9289999999999
on right now with the conference is

1775.83 --> 1782.4289999999999
coming up and I've got some traveling

1777.929 --> 1786.69
coming up and you know I started a new

1782.429 --> 1789.48
public discord server oh yeah yeah I

1786.69 --> 1790.559
heard about that yeah afraid I'm not

1789.48 --> 1794.949
gonna join though

1790.559 --> 1796.809
that's okay I understand yeah I wish

1794.949 --> 1800.249
almost there was a way to do it without

1796.809 --> 1804.399
doing it but I don't I don't mind

1800.249 --> 1806.919
communicating like on a youtube hangout

1804.399 --> 1808.6589999999999
where there is a discord server added on

1806.919 --> 1809.759
to it as long as I don't have to go

1808.659 --> 1814.3890000000001
there myself

1809.759 --> 1819.599
so because Nathan's been doing that for

1814.389 --> 1824.6789999999999
a long time seems to work out fine yeah

1819.599 --> 1826.389
I like that platform it can be it can be

1824.679 --> 1828.5690000000002
really a really good platform and you

1826.389 --> 1830.7389999999998
know it's just like any other sort of

1828.569 --> 1833.44
social platform you're gonna run into

1830.739 --> 1837.789
you know problems and disagreements and

1833.44 --> 1839.229
people trolling you and you know it's

1837.789 --> 1840.719
just how it is you can't really avoid

1839.229 --> 1847.449
that doesn't really matter where you go

1840.719 --> 1849.3990000000001
right I guess I just have really bad

1847.449 --> 1852.279
experiences with it from the start

1849.399 --> 1854.2289999999998
I stole the story too many times how I

1852.279 --> 1857.469
tried it out the first time and that was

1854.229 --> 1860.229
like with Antonio sue Barret still so I

1857.469 --> 1862.479
don't know not retroactively Lee blaming

1860.229 --> 1864.759
him but who knows

1862.479 --> 1866.8590000000002
you know the guy's really sneaky so and

1864.759 --> 1868.569
I think he did try to fool around with

1866.859 --> 1870.489
some people's computers at some point

1868.569 --> 1873.9089999999999
when everybody was still kind of

1870.489 --> 1876.19
trusting him but yeah my computer like

1873.909 --> 1878.0490000000002
crashed after that had to reinstall

1876.19 --> 1882.339
everything so I was like okay I'm not

1878.049 --> 1886.599
gonna try that again probably works

1882.339 --> 1889.059
better now but I just I don't know that

1886.599 --> 1893.289
the wells been poisoned for me and I

1889.059 --> 1899.379
don't like the name yeah the name does

1893.289 --> 1901.049
imply negativity but it's just like

1899.379 --> 1904.299
anything else that's what you make of it

1901.049 --> 1906.339
you know my server and I was on somebody

1904.299 --> 1907.959
else's server where you know things were

1906.339 --> 1910.349
happening that I didn't agree with and

1907.959 --> 1913.299
then that server ended up you know

1910.349 --> 1915.369
completely being looped and taken over

1913.299 --> 1917.319
and just destroyed so that's why I

1915.369 --> 1919.97
started my own so that I could set it up

1917.319 --> 1923.37
and have it be a lot more positive

1919.97 --> 1924.99
and you know if somebody's there who

1923.37 --> 1927.779
wants to just cause problems and be

1924.99 --> 1931.409
disruptive I can get rid of them and you

1927.779 --> 1933.99
know keep things on a positive note hmm

1931.409 --> 1936.48
all right so it's almost like a a chat

1933.99 --> 1940.08
forum but with video interfacing

1936.48 --> 1942.659
capabilities well you can't do video

1940.08 --> 1944.97
unless you're in a private call most of

1942.659 --> 1946.7990000000002
it is voice chats and then there would

1944.97 --> 1949.769
be a there's a lobby like a text chat

1946.799 --> 1952.35
lobby where you can post files and

1949.769 --> 1954.48
pictures and and video links and stuff

1952.35 --> 1956.73
like that and the server I've got has

1954.48 --> 1958.8600000000001
been boosted up to a level two so now

1956.73 --> 1963.919
anybody who's a user on the server can

1958.86 --> 1967.4089999999999
upload files up to 50 Meg's hmm okay

1963.919 --> 1969.51
that's nice yeah so you can share a lot

1967.409 --> 1972.8700000000001
more information and stuff like that so

1969.51 --> 1976.08
it's pretty cool okay right so there's

1972.87 --> 1978.539
no video okay it's all voice there's a

1976.08 --> 1980.97
voice system on top of it and you can

1978.539 --> 1983.149
share pictures and everything then you

1980.97 --> 1988.44
can still do that right right okay right

1983.149 --> 1993.299
mm-hm okay good to know I didn't know

1988.44 --> 1996.48
I'd never even got that far so what is

1993.299 --> 2001.69
saying I have an echo I don't hear it

1996.48 --> 2006.71
but it could be that my oh wait

2001.69 --> 2009.38
put down my sound a bit uh wait that

2006.71 --> 2013.8400000000001
maybe a little bit too much no I don't

2009.38 --> 2016.7
think there's I don't hear the echo

2013.84 --> 2020.36
anyway could you get a little bit into

2016.7 --> 2024.95
the whole Fe core versus slice parking

2020.36 --> 2032.389
situation what exactly happened if you

2024.95 --> 2034.73
want okay well basically he started

2032.389 --> 2036.76
making videos about us using our logo

2034.73 --> 2042.71
without our permission which is against

2036.76 --> 2047.179
YouTube's Terms of Service so we filed a

2042.71 --> 2048.859
complaint it's pretty simple you know

2047.179 --> 2051.619
and all the stuff that he's saying it's

2048.859 --> 2052.89
like it's all just ridiculous stuff

2051.619 --> 2056.69
anyway it's

2052.89 --> 2059.0099999999998
mmm-hmm I don't know we're just tired of

2056.69 --> 2062.94
dealing with these people so now we're

2059.01 --> 2064.98
just going to deal with them the best

2062.94 --> 2067.35
way we know how I'm not gonna respond

2064.98 --> 2071.1
we're not gonna engage in conversations

2067.35 --> 2072.9
with them I never do but I mostly just

2071.1 --> 2074.88
ignored them because I don't even know

2072.9 --> 2077.2200000000003
how to approach it you know they take my

2074.88 --> 2080.2400000000002
face all the time and do all kinds of

2077.22 --> 2084.9599999999996
crazy [ __ ] with it as you well know

2080.24 --> 2087.8399999999997
probably right now yeah I don't really

2084.96 --> 2089.9700000000003
know what to do about that even and from

2087.84 --> 2093.4500000000003
what I understand in general it's like

2089.97 --> 2096.0
okay you can take like up to 10 seconds

2093.45 --> 2100.37
of something without any problem no

2096.0 --> 2103.77
matter what and you can potentially use

2100.37 --> 2107.69
longer material if it is very specific

2103.77 --> 2110.58
if it is like putting attention to that

2107.69 --> 2112.92
but I don't know if it has to be

2110.58 --> 2115.2599999999998
positive or negative I don't understand

2112.92 --> 2117.54
how that works but at the same time if

2115.26 --> 2120.63
you have specifically copyrighted

2117.54 --> 2123.66
elements that you can legally refer to

2120.63 --> 2126.12
then that just Trump's all of that

2123.66 --> 2128.96
doesn't really matter if you

2126.12 --> 2132.99
specifically put that into place

2128.96 --> 2135.03
so yeah with him using our company name

2132.99 --> 2137.7299999999996
and our logo and changing our logo that

2135.03 --> 2139.23
is definitely copyright infringement and

2137.73 --> 2143.22
he could lose his channel over that

2139.23 --> 2146.43
right okay yeah it I thought something

2143.22 --> 2149.25
like that in that direction because

2146.43 --> 2152.22
these guys they they think they can just

2149.25 --> 2153.87
do anything you know yeah well and

2152.22 --> 2155.37
here's the thing you know what are they

2153.87 --> 2156.87
so afraid of if they're so sure that

2155.37 --> 2159.15
earth is a ball why are they so afraid

2156.87 --> 2162.9
of people like us getting together and

2159.15 --> 2168.2000000000003
investigating that claim what's the big

2162.9 --> 2172.05
deal it makes them look at that

2168.2 --> 2173.2799999999997
especially when you compare all the Flat

2172.05 --> 2176.46
Earth groups that have been working

2173.28 --> 2179.4300000000003
together even it with like in shows like

2176.46 --> 2182.85
in a certain show or like you guys Fe

2179.43 --> 2185.8199999999997
Corps and just look at how many groups

2182.85 --> 2186.47
have blown up and how many are still

2185.82 --> 2189.7400000000002
together

2186.47 --> 2191.6499999999996
and like evolved together and become

2189.74 --> 2194.089
stronger friends and now compare that

2191.65 --> 2198.17
development in the last four years to

2194.089 --> 2199.7599999999998
the ballers okay they're always trying

2198.17 --> 2202.67
to bluff their way through like they're

2199.76 --> 2204.3190000000004
doing so much better but there's been so

2202.67 --> 2206.75
many videos where they just start

2204.319 --> 2209.75
attacking one another savagely and

2206.75 --> 2212.48
that's like they really don't know any

2209.75 --> 2214.55
dignity even towards one another and I

2212.48 --> 2216.41
think that's that's been really standing

2214.55 --> 2218.7200000000003
out to me is that when ballers break

2216.41 --> 2220.94
apart it's like who they become enemies

2218.72 --> 2222.77
all of a sudden and now there's some

2220.94 --> 2227.359
money ballers that are just enemies

2222.77 --> 2232.43
among other ballers have you noticed

2227.359 --> 2234.71
that yes so they're almost bound to

2232.43 --> 2238.0989999999997
eventually just get so distracted by

2234.71 --> 2240.91
attacking one another that we're gonna

2238.099 --> 2243.29
be scot-free basically at some points

2240.91 --> 2252.2
because they're gonna be too preoccupied

2243.29 --> 2257.0299999999997
with one another hopefully yeah hmm but

2252.2 --> 2259.22
yeah it's good to know that I agree you

2257.03 --> 2263.8100000000004
know these ballers when when they really

2259.22 --> 2265.3689999999997
start to you know and if you look at

2263.81 --> 2267.0499999999997
what they're what they're trying to say

2265.369 --> 2269.089
in these videos all they're trying to do

2267.05 --> 2271.9700000000003
is attack us personally they're trying

2269.089 --> 2273.74
to attack you know attack our integrity

2271.97 --> 2275.27
trying to say that we're being dishonest

2273.74 --> 2277.31
and we're not being dishonest we're

2275.27 --> 2279.02
doing everything by the book okay we

2277.31 --> 2281.24
have this company that we work with that

2279.02 --> 2283.52
tells us everything that we're supposed

2281.24 --> 2285.29
to do how what what we're supposed to do

2283.52 --> 2287.93
in order to get our tax-exempt status

2285.29 --> 2290.089
with the IRS how we're supposed to move

2287.93 --> 2292.5789999999997
forward and we follow that to the tee

2290.089 --> 2294.23
and that's what we've been doing you

2292.579 --> 2295.819
know every time something comes up we

2294.23 --> 2297.7400000000002
call them and we double check with what

2295.819 --> 2299.329
we're supposed to do and we do it you

2297.74 --> 2301.7299999999996
know they want to complain about us not

2299.329 --> 2304.01
filing our taxes yet or making that

2301.73 --> 2305.63
information public we're not required to

2304.01 --> 2307.2200000000003
until we officially receive our

2305.63 --> 2309.109
tax-exempt status and we're still

2307.22 --> 2310.8489999999997
waiting for that we've we've finished

2309.109 --> 2312.859
our application we've applied we've

2310.849 --> 2315.8590000000004
given them all the information and all

2312.859 --> 2317.5989999999997
we can do is wait for the IRS to get

2315.859 --> 2319.43
back to us I mean that's out of our

2317.599 --> 2322.339
control

2319.43 --> 2324.2889999999998
if anybody and anybody who knows we're

2322.339 --> 2326.45
dealing with a government entity or the

2324.289 --> 2329.5890000000004
IRS I mean they take their time and

2326.45 --> 2332.24
there's nothing we can do about it

2329.589 --> 2334.0099999999998
that's just all there is to it and as

2332.24 --> 2335.45
soon as we get our exempt status then

2334.01 --> 2337.849
we'll move forward with making that

2335.45 --> 2339.98
information public and until then we're

2337.849 --> 2341.569
just not required to and we don't any

2339.98 --> 2355.039
owe anybody any further explanation

2341.569 --> 2361.099
other than that that's just it why was a

2355.039 --> 2363.289
mutant yeah that is just it and I don't

2361.099 --> 2366.079
know why ballers always think it's their

2363.289 --> 2369.829
business to start poking around it you

2366.079 --> 2375.319
know anyone's organization out there you

2369.829 --> 2377.63
know it's just ridiculous like even if I

2375.319 --> 2379.73
probably try to start up some kind of

2377.63 --> 2382.339
company thing a little bit bigger then

2379.73 --> 2385.4
I'd see the ballers just immediately try

2382.339 --> 2387.95
to dig it dig up the foundations like

2385.4 --> 2389.69
when I'm still trying to figure it out

2387.95 --> 2391.7599999999998
basically that doing that kind of thing

2389.69 --> 2395.96
they love to do that they just want to

2391.76 --> 2400.789
trash it all down there was any kind of

2395.96 --> 2404.869
room to do anything yeah well that's all

2400.789 --> 2406.3390000000004
they have right they can't attack the

2404.869 --> 2411.13
information they can only attack the

2406.339 --> 2411.13
people right

2413.39 --> 2419.96
yeah I don't know why they keep on doing

2417.53 --> 2422.42
it because they've got nothing better to

2419.96 --> 2425.42
do as small minds are when it's like you

2422.42 --> 2428.06
know what that quote you know great

2425.42 --> 2430.31
minds discuss ideas small minds discuss

2428.06 --> 2432.17
people what we're dealing with here is a

2430.31 --> 2433.85
bunch of small minds who only want to

2432.17 --> 2435.44
discuss people they don't want to

2433.85 --> 2437.21
discuss ideas they don't want to look at

2435.44 --> 2441.02
information they don't want to question

2437.21 --> 2445.03
anything or think critically all right

2441.02 --> 2452.72
they're just in it for the pecking order

2445.03 --> 2455.3
that's right yeah makes sense yeah well

2452.72 --> 2458.0899999999997
thank God that we're still just doing

2455.3 --> 2460.04
our thing and discussing and developing

2458.09 --> 2463.7000000000003
as we go and there's even some ballers

2460.04 --> 2467.62
that I've experienced that once I get

2463.7 --> 2470.0
the in a room with them and maneuver the

2467.62 --> 2471.56
atmosphere within the room as

2470.0 --> 2473.87
everybody's talking towards a certain

2471.56 --> 2475.79
direction then suddenly they can

2473.87 --> 2478.79
actually be quite useful to figure

2475.79 --> 2480.89
things out that's the funny thing so I

2478.79 --> 2482.87
don't think that all ballers are just

2480.89 --> 2484.91
complete waste of time and useless it's

2482.87 --> 2487.37
just a couple of the really nasty ones

2484.91 --> 2488.96
that as you say just focus purely on

2487.37 --> 2491.0
attacking people all the time and

2488.96 --> 2494.27
trolling them but there's still some

2491.0 --> 2495.8
well let's just say baller enthusiasts

2494.27 --> 2498.29
out there especially tied in

2495.8 --> 2501.86
professionally somehow with astrophysics

2498.29 --> 2503.99
and that kind of thing that they do have

2501.86 --> 2507.6800000000003
a lot of information and they are kind

2503.99 --> 2509.75
of there also to share it and try to

2507.68 --> 2513.2799999999997
find some pride in that and I think that

2509.75 --> 2515.63
we can kind of use that as long as we

2513.28 --> 2517.7900000000004
yeah get them in the right position

2515.63 --> 2520.34
because if you just let them to their

2517.79 --> 2523.43
own devices they'll search oh they're so

2520.34 --> 2526.7000000000003
stupid oh my god we've got so much data

2523.43 --> 2530.96
and proof and like Laurie said yesterday

2526.7 --> 2535.6099999999997
on Jose's like we have looked at all all

2530.96 --> 2541.07
the videos and debunked all of them yeah

2535.61 --> 2542.75
of course Laurie of course and he really

2541.07 --> 2545.17
believed it too that was the silly thing

2542.75 --> 2545.17
about it

2545.37 --> 2552.0699999999997
so but if you get them maneuvered into

2548.58 --> 2554.98
into a proper discussion about details

2552.07 --> 2556.9
and get their focus to that they're

2554.98 --> 2560.62
still kind of useful to work with in my

2556.9 --> 2564.28
opinion can be interesting yeah I agree

2560.62 --> 2568.02
I agree especially for people who are

2564.28 --> 2570.46
just observing that conversation indeed

2568.02 --> 2572.35
it's probably actually more beneficial

2570.46 --> 2577.33
to people observing it to them to the

2572.35 --> 2580.5099999999998
people involved I mean a sleeping

2577.33 --> 2582.88
warrior right away so it was good to

2580.51 --> 2587.11
team up with him seem to be doing it a

2582.88 --> 2592.63
lot on Jose's yesterday again was me

2587.11 --> 2594.2400000000002
sleeping warrior and an ally bee and I

2592.63 --> 2596.29
don't know I like it there sometimes

2594.24 --> 2598.7799999999997
when they're not there it's like

2596.29 --> 2600.82
unbearable but when sleeping warrior

2598.78 --> 2605.9500000000003
gets in there I'd be inclined to jump in

2600.82 --> 2608.65
with him yeah where was the set yeah

2605.95 --> 2611.7999999999997
Jose's I know it's it's been a [ __ ]

2608.65 --> 2615.4
I know but yeah under the right

2611.8 --> 2617.8900000000003
circumstances it's doable

2615.4 --> 2621.07
you know it's just for me it's really

2617.89 --> 2624.79
spot the really really nasty figures and

2621.07 --> 2626.8900000000003
just make Jose kick them out and you can

2624.79 --> 2628.69
because it's not that hard you just have

2626.89 --> 2631.27
to poke them and just show them like

2628.69 --> 2633.28
these people are literally here only to

2631.27 --> 2635.2599999999998
disturb the conversation and one that's

2633.28 --> 2637.09
when that's cleared up it usually takes

2635.26 --> 2640.2400000000002
just a few minutes then house it does

2637.09 --> 2642.28
kind of kick them out so he does he does

2640.24 --> 2644.56
try to make a good platform that I I

2642.28 --> 2648.25
have to get recognition for that he does

2644.56 --> 2650.83
listen to advice of mine and some others

2648.25 --> 2652.93
and yeah when you get the really nasty

2650.83 --> 2654.43
figures out of there you the ballers

2652.93 --> 2657.0699999999997
that really want to have a good or

2654.43 --> 2661.99
interesting talk are left and then yeah

2657.07 --> 2663.61
that's pretty good yeah yeah I can see

2661.99 --> 2665.5899999999997
that I mean I've had plenty of good

2663.61 --> 2668.4700000000003
conversations with ballers the

2665.59 --> 2669.6400000000003
reasonable ones you know the ones who

2668.47 --> 2671.08
aren't just there to attack your

2669.64 --> 2674.14
character because they've got nothing

2671.08 --> 2674.86
else right now and and they'll be caught

2674.14 --> 2678.37
lying

2674.86 --> 2680.05
you know the delve they'll try to dig it

2678.37 --> 2681.49
and then fall in it and then just be

2680.05 --> 2683.8300000000004
caught with a lie or something it

2681.49 --> 2686.29
happens but at least she can have a

2683.83 --> 2689.5299999999997
conversation with them and they're not

2686.29 --> 2691.5099999999998
just always attacking the character

2689.53 --> 2695.59
which is complete waste of time

2691.51 --> 2697.2700000000004
so yeah you know almost all the ballers

2695.59 --> 2699.73
even the good one that I considered the

2697.27 --> 2701.08
good ones they always have their moments

2699.73 --> 2705.67
when they just do this really

2701.08 --> 2707.56
embarrassing doublespeak lie [ __ ] they

2705.67 --> 2717.25
just can't help it it's when it happens

2707.56 --> 2719.38
when they get stuck that's right oh yeah

2717.25 --> 2720.55
Pete Mars did kind of ruin the

2719.38 --> 2722.4700000000003
conversation didn't he

2720.55 --> 2728.92
Pete Mars has been a real pain in the

2722.47 --> 2732.8199999999997
ass recently man we mean recently well

2728.92 --> 2736.23
he has his periods ways enough okay but

2732.82 --> 2738.79
he's a real dick Riesling man

2736.23 --> 2740.62
yeah I can't waste my time with people

2738.79 --> 2743.77
like that anymore honestly I just can't

2740.62 --> 2745.9
I just I just don't have the capacity or

2743.77 --> 2748.99
the patience to deal with conversations

2745.9 --> 2751.1800000000003
on that level anymore I've got just too

2748.99 --> 2753.85
much other stuff going on way too much

2751.18 --> 2758.47
more important things to deal with no

2753.85 --> 2761.41
all right I don't know with P P P Mars

2758.47 --> 2764.1699999999996
like the only real thing that could be

2761.41 --> 2767.41
considered kind of useful with him is

2764.17 --> 2771.91
when you start to discuss 911 because he

2767.41 --> 2773.77
does know so much about this like it's I

2771.91 --> 2779.2
think it's a time when he really paid a

2773.77 --> 2782.14
lot of attention and he's just four so

2779.2 --> 2783.9399999999996
but yeah but that's it it's like 9/11 if

2782.14 --> 2787.7799999999997
you draw other things into it he usually

2783.94 --> 2789.61
just goes berserk and goes all weird but

2787.78 --> 2791.98
not you can get a decent conversation

2789.61 --> 2797.73
out of him when you talk about 9/11 at

2791.98 --> 2797.73
least but yeah it's very specific

2799.22 --> 2809.0099999999998
indeed right so anything else you would

2806.61 --> 2811.92
like to bring up maybe because I'm

2809.01 --> 2814.0800000000004
nominating you will you be in Amsterdam

2811.92 --> 2815.34
stir damn for the conference how long do

2814.08 --> 2818.49
you live in Amsterdam

2815.34 --> 2822.09
no no but yeah in the Netherlands

2818.49 --> 2822.54
everything is very close so I live what

2822.09 --> 2827.4900000000002
is it

2822.54 --> 2829.83
maybe to any kilometers away so it's not

2827.49 --> 2832.1299999999997
that far away I'll just hop on the train

2829.83 --> 2835.89
and be there in 20 minutes or something

2832.13 --> 2838.59
awesome yeah cool I'll see you there I

2835.89 --> 2841.65
will be there I think I arrived in

2838.59 --> 2845.27
Amsterdam on the 25th I have to check my

2841.65 --> 2850.9500000000003
flight right I'll be right there

2845.27 --> 2852.45

3035.509 --> 3039.68
basically a music venue it's like you

3039.68 --> 3043.97
bambam bands will go there and play and

3041.539 --> 3046.849
what they have is just yeah they have a

3043.97 --> 3049.5789999999997
stage and then they have this really

3046.849 --> 3052.789
cool LED screen up on stage that's like

3049.579 --> 3054.319
full color it's super bright that's that

3052.789 --> 3056.69
they can show the visuals on it's not a

3054.319 --> 3058.46
projector you know it's this bright LED

3056.69 --> 3062.119
screen and they have a really awesome

3058.46 --> 3064.88
sound system and they have a kitchen

3062.119 --> 3065.96
they have a full bar and then right

3064.88 --> 3067.7000000000003
across the street

3065.96 --> 3069.38
a bunch of restaurants and the hotels

3067.7 --> 3071.48
are within walking distance it's really

3069.38 --> 3074.03
like the perfect location to do

3071.48 --> 3076.93
something like this yeah Wow yeah really

3074.03 --> 3080.9300000000003
big screen that is so awesome for

3076.93 --> 3081.68
presentations yes that is amazing yeah

3080.93 --> 3085.3999999999996
cool

3081.68 --> 3087.71
yeah Wow I hope you're gonna some people

3085.4 --> 3091.46
are gonna be filming some of it love to

3087.71 --> 3093.4700000000003
see that yeah yeah I mean you know we're

3091.46 --> 3095.45
it's we're kind of doing it it's really

3093.47 --> 3097.25
low budget for us because we wanted to

3095.45 --> 3099.2
keep the ticket prices down because like

3097.25 --> 3103.79
the tickets to attend this event are not

3099.2 --> 3105.6499999999996
more than 30 bucks so it's definitely a

3103.79 --> 3108.08
less expensive event it's only one day

3105.65 --> 3111.2000000000003
but we wanted to really make it more

3108.08 --> 3113.089
accessible for people so you know we

3111.2 --> 3114.6499999999996
didn't we're not setting up a whole like

3113.089 --> 3117.17
live-streaming crew we have to pay

3114.65 --> 3119.42
people to video it and livestream it and

3117.17 --> 3122.359
stuff but I will try to livestream it

3119.42 --> 3124.339
maybe through my channel I might

3122.359 --> 3126.2599999999998
livestream Oh some of it definitely

3124.339 --> 3128.599
going to try to record it at the very

3126.26 --> 3130.6400000000003
least and maybe you know publish it as a

3128.599 --> 3132.02
video after the fact I'm not not quite

3130.64 --> 3135.71
sure how that's going to work out yet

3132.02 --> 3138.02
but definitely want to want to do

3135.71 --> 3142.16
something that's really cool to have

3138.02 --> 3144.44
like a really glorious medium situation

3142.16 --> 3146.33
to do that kind of thing because even

3144.44 --> 3148.31
with low budget if you just got the

3146.33 --> 3153.0499999999997
right elements there you could still do

3148.31 --> 3155.06
a grand thing with it yeah definitely

3153.05 --> 3156.8590000000004
that's like really good low-budget

3155.06 --> 3160.04
filmmaking you can still make it look

3156.859 --> 3161.96
really quality awesome with very little

3160.04 --> 3165.23
if you plan it right if you just have to

3161.96 --> 3169.52
write devices to do it so that's that's

3165.23 --> 3173.089
good like it yes yes yes it's gonna be

3169.52 --> 3175.52
awesome cool looking forward to it or

3173.089 --> 3178.19
well the videos I'm fortunately not

3175.52 --> 3179.48
gonna be there but yeah yeah but it's

3178.19 --> 3182.089
really cool cuz I've already had a lot

3179.48 --> 3182.9900000000002
of people you contact me and say that

3182.089 --> 3185.089
they're coming and they're really

3182.99 --> 3187.04
excited to come and because because of

3185.089 --> 3189.5
the location here in the southeast and

3187.04 --> 3191.24
because the price is so low that they're

3189.5 --> 3197.69
finally able to attend something like

3191.24 --> 3199.6699999999996
this so how much $30 is the most

3197.69 --> 3202.46
expensive ticket for the event

3199.67 --> 3204.4900000000002
that's nothing yeah it's a very chichi

3202.46 --> 3208.46
band stage performance that's nothing

3204.49 --> 3210.3199999999997
that's right and so people can you know

3208.46 --> 3212.51
spend the money on getting there and

3210.32 --> 3214.79
making accommodations to be able to come

3212.51 --> 3217.2200000000003
and listen to people like Rob Skiba and

3214.79 --> 3219.02
Mark Sargeant and Bob speak you know and

3217.22 --> 3222.1699999999996
they don't it's not gonna cost them a

3219.02 --> 3224.33
thousand dollars to attend like you know

3222.17 --> 3225.71
the big conferences do basically most

3224.33 --> 3230.35
people if you go to a big conference

3225.71 --> 3230.35
easily you're dropping $1,000 to attend

3232.72 --> 3235.72
so

3239.52 --> 3246.96
right ah thank you Karen B for ya

3243.39 --> 3248.79
informing us about I'm now pretty I'm

3246.96 --> 3250.65

3253.77 --> 3258.0
yeah well if it goes well we definitely

3255.33 --> 3260.0099999999998
try want to make it an annual event and

3258.0 --> 3261.75
it's you know it's October it's when I

3260.01 --> 3263.76

going on in October was the take on the

3263.76 --> 3268.59
world conference know take on the world

3268.59 --> 3271.7400000000002
there's another event no there is one

3270.42 --> 3274.7400000000002
but it doesn't matter I'm not even gonna

3271.74 --> 3280.14
say what it is you mean the Halloween

3274.74 --> 3284.16
thing no no no no I'm talking about I'm

3280.14 --> 3286.8599999999997
