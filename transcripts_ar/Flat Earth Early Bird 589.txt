all the patreon sponsors yeah let me go

78.33 --> 87.71
through that for a second before I

82.11 --> 97.259
continue the shoe right so I got

87.71 --> 100.729
basically 25 euros let me name the

97.259 --> 100.729
sponsor so I gotta find him first

111.35 --> 115.30999999999999

gaining wisdom and Brenda Brent um so

147.62 --> 155.15
thank you for the continuous monthly

150.35 --> 160.7
support from patreon members so let's

155.15 --> 164.36
continue the weather today is yeah I

160.7 --> 167.0
need the same is yesterday although a

164.36 --> 170.3
little less rain maybe but yeah not less

167.0 --> 172.4
clouds as you can see and it is like

170.3 --> 176.48000000000002
windy it's really windy it's still very

172.4 --> 179.6
moist like I went out there with the

176.48 --> 183.38
jacket on and even though it's not cold

179.6 --> 185.03
I would yeah like it if you're stand

183.38 --> 187.25
still it's pretty cold but if you're

185.03 --> 190.459
gonna be moving then you really will get

187.25 --> 196.67
warm because it's because of the moist

190.459 --> 201.65
levels anyway yeah still no activity

196.67 --> 203.83999999999997
over there at church I don't know if

201.65 --> 213.47
they're ever gonna reopen I don't I

203.84 --> 216.8
don't get it anyway hmm I got some

213.47 --> 219.22
Tamera coffee with me and green tea as

216.8 --> 219.22
usual

222.43 --> 235.579
and I made notes cause lots of happened

226.159 --> 237.2
yesterday right cuz after my show I

235.579 --> 240.56
didn't watch it back my way thought it

237.2 --> 244.189
was pretty good uh I went over to Ma

240.56 --> 247.22
UK's or well it was an emic UK server

244.189 --> 250.22
but basically Tony streamed it and it

247.22 --> 254.629
was the discussion on that platform

250.22 --> 257.0
pretty much Tony & Co show about about

254.629 --> 263.27
gravity and about relative density it

257.0 --> 271.22
from well it lasted over four hours go

263.27 --> 274.63
show and Tony four hours yeah so you can

271.22 --> 279.19000000000005
imagine that every conceivable angle

274.63 --> 279.19
concerning the subject had been treated

279.729 --> 286.55
probably three times over now but Co

285.229 --> 289.58
show wasn't getting it because he

286.55 --> 291.32
doesn't because he's just demented he

289.58 --> 293.57
just didn't want to get he didn't want

291.32 --> 297.229
to realize that he was completely stuck

293.57 --> 299.36
in a corner it was completely stuck and

297.229 --> 301.099
yeah after a while I got kind of sick of

299.36 --> 303.56
it I came in there when they were

301.099 --> 307.28
already going for an hour I even joined

303.56 --> 308.69
in at one part like it got really sick

307.28 --> 311.86999999999995
of it it's just like car show you

308.69 --> 315.169
[ __ ] idiot just pay attention I like

311.87 --> 317.06
I got Nathan in patients response and

315.169 --> 318.62
and cleared up a couple of details about

317.06 --> 321.11
relative density and how that works

318.62 --> 323.87
because Tony was doing a good job but

321.11 --> 327.11
sometimes he was like saying like the

323.87 --> 328.699
object is miles out away from its

327.11 --> 330.47
equilibrium point well that's a

328.699 --> 332.24
technically incorrect statement because

330.47 --> 334.22
distance does not matter as the only

332.24 --> 337.36
matter that thing that actually matters

334.22 --> 341.389
in relative density is the differential

337.36 --> 344.03000000000003
between the density of the object and

341.389 --> 346.28000000000003
the density of its medium that's the

344.03 --> 350.27
yeah and the bigger the differential is

346.28 --> 352.669
the more force will be exerted on the

350.27 --> 355.669
object to find an equilibrium with its

352.669 --> 358.349
surrounding if that is possible

355.669 --> 360.539
because yeah it would have to be able to

358.349 --> 363.93
travel and then if it's traveling does

360.539 --> 365.669
it enter a a medium that is closer to

363.93 --> 368.699
its own density you don't know that

365.669 --> 370.62
there's no guarantee of that so doesn't

368.699 --> 376.05
even matter if you have a giant giant

370.62 --> 378.36
deep hole in the earth just because it's

376.05 --> 380.43
lower doesn't mean it's going to stop

378.36 --> 382.77000000000004
dropping no if as long as it's

380.43 --> 384.599
surrounded by air then the differential

382.77 --> 386.58
between the air and the object will

384.599 --> 391.259
cause it to keep on falling just as if

386.58 --> 393.33
it were way way up at a high altitude so

391.259 --> 396.47
anyway that was that I'm not gonna go

393.33 --> 399.93
through all that again it was four hours

396.47 --> 403.77000000000004
but yeah impressive feat on Tony's part

399.93 --> 406.62
to just keep it going I drove me nuts

403.77 --> 410.219
after a while yeah I after a while I

406.62 --> 410.78000000000003
just cut out and and like watched a

410.219 --> 413.31
movie

410.78 --> 421.79999999999995
yeah sleeping warrior Anthony that's

413.31 --> 423.81
right Tony Dan theny Riley yeah so that

421.8 --> 426.12
was that was pretty interesting but yeah

423.81 --> 430.5
last incredibly long and like yeah I

426.12 --> 434.509
watched Central Intelligence in between

430.5 --> 436.889
which turned out to be a complicated

434.509 --> 439.62
interesting movie but yeah with dubious

436.889 --> 444.449
elements but it's blatantly obvious it

439.62 --> 447.539
is like a a spy action thriller type

444.449 --> 449.699
setup with comedy and I don't know you I

447.539 --> 451.59
don't think everybody's gonna like it

449.699 --> 453.87
there was a lot of cooking programming

451.59 --> 458.729
in there a lot very typical liberal

453.87 --> 462.509
comedy so personally I don't think it

458.729 --> 464.46
was one of the Rock's best movies but he

462.509 --> 468.27000000000004
still played the character very well

464.46 --> 470.159
that he was playing yeah so when I

468.27 --> 473.00899999999996
finished watching that movie I got back

470.159 --> 475.08
and they were still going like nothing

473.009 --> 477.21000000000004
had happened I just watched a movie in

475.08 --> 481.169
between came back like nothing no time

477.21 --> 484.68
had passed it's very typical

481.169 --> 489.24
so that happened yeah there was no own

484.68 --> 490.71
Benjamin that I've seen at all that was

489.24 --> 492.509
kind of odd I don't know why he didn't

490.71 --> 495.029
stream maybe in response to something

492.509 --> 499.319
that happened today before I don't know

495.029 --> 506.759
why maybe he's too busy but ya know Big

499.319 --> 511.399
Bear right also yeah I started a new

506.759 --> 513.899
serie series because I remembered that

511.399 --> 515.88
well I was actually mistakenly

513.899 --> 521.39
remembered that there was I thought a

515.88 --> 526.47
movie like a new movie called Picard

521.39 --> 528.329
with jean-luc basically and then yeah

526.47 --> 530.37
when I tried to look it up I figured out

528.329 --> 533.9399999999999
wait it's not a movie it's a series okay

530.37 --> 535.5600000000001
okay so I've downloaded it at least the

533.94 --> 537.5100000000001
first season I don't know how many there

535.56 --> 539.2199999999999
are it's not a Netflix that I could have

537.51 --> 543.36
found it otherwise it was presented

539.22 --> 545.37
itself blatantly obviously so I saw some

543.36 --> 547.62
of that and things I've heard about it

545.37 --> 549.9590000000001
before kind of did come true it is kind

547.62 --> 553.279
of a ok Picard is getting himself a

549.959 --> 558.949
surrounded by different types of women

553.279 --> 562.92
that's like yeah but I thought that the

558.949 --> 566.699
atmosphere put down and the music a lot

562.92 --> 569.55
of classical music that it it is still a

566.699 --> 572.0699999999999
worthwhile series to sit through and see

569.55 --> 576.12
where it's going has some interesting

572.07 --> 583.7090000000001
concepts going on it it kind of blew my

576.12 --> 586.23
mind because I think yeah remember like

583.709 --> 588.42
wait yeah this is like some time ago I

586.23 --> 590.4300000000001
think when Picard series just came out

588.42 --> 592.8
or something or maybe even before that I

590.43 --> 595.709
was like complaining why didn't Star

592.8 --> 597.5999999999999
Trek Voyager continue why didn't it

595.709 --> 599.3389999999999
continue like with the Borg there so

597.6 --> 601.73
much possible like oh you're the bore

599.339 --> 605.0100000000001
could just suddenly break down and then

601.73 --> 610.589
Starfleet could try to assimilate the

605.01 --> 612.269
Borg I was watching this series and

610.589 --> 614.07
apparently that's kind of what it's

612.269 --> 616.5600000000001
about partially it's like

614.07 --> 619.0100000000001
the Borg cube part of the series we're

616.56 --> 623.01
literally Starfleet is in the bar cube

619.01 --> 625.23
doing research doing science and

623.01 --> 626.1899999999999
engineering on the board it's

625.23 --> 628.74
fascinating

626.19 --> 632.5100000000001
like I that has piqued my interest and

628.74 --> 636.99
it's like wow they actually did it

632.51 --> 638.0699999999999
so yeah I've now I'm now at like Episode

636.99 --> 641.34
four or something

638.07 --> 646.2900000000001
I have no idea where it'll go if it'll

641.34 --> 648.57
hold up like yeah the characters how

646.29 --> 651.0899999999999
interesting were they I think they were

648.57 --> 654.9300000000001
better than in Star Trek discovery it

651.09 --> 659.4300000000001
seemed like it the same makers were kind

654.93 --> 661.38
of involved in in I know it's hard it's

659.43 --> 664.5
hard to explain it's just a feeling that

661.38 --> 668.34
I felt like the discovery Star Trek

664.5 --> 670.59
makers were probably at least partially

668.34 --> 672.96
involved in it just because of the style

670.59 --> 676.14
in a way and coloring I don't know it

672.96 --> 678.09
was maybe I'm wrong but I'm gonna keep

676.14 --> 681.29
people watching in a sewer where they'll

678.09 --> 684.1800000000001
go all right other than that I was

681.29 --> 692.01
Rodrigo Ferrari Nunez

684.18 --> 694.5899999999999
yeah good Channel and eight hour we

692.01 --> 700.04
didn't know it what is it now ten hours

694.59 --> 705.98
ago he did a a basically video reports

700.04 --> 708.81
yeah a review of a documentary

705.98 --> 712.02
supposedly about an alien invasion

708.81 --> 714.81
concept and just lighting highlighting

712.02 --> 719.09
the fear porn and all that and the mind

714.81 --> 722.28
was very good it was very good yeah and

719.09 --> 724.5500000000001
interesting to keep tabs it wasn't their

722.28 --> 729.36
life though I'd left a comment anyway

724.55 --> 733.38
that was pretty much my day online

729.36 --> 736.95
yesterday and a very unexpected but

733.38 --> 739.18
pleasant surprise guess what I got in

736.95 --> 745.6800000000001
the mail

739.18 --> 751.4699999999999
it only took over three months but I got

745.68 --> 754.4499999999999
Rock tobacco from Canada whoo-hoo I

751.47 --> 755.6800000000001
didn't think it was gonna arrive but

754.45 --> 759.6400000000001
yeah it did

755.68 --> 762.8199999999999
so I cut some of that down put it in

759.64 --> 767.31
here and yeah it's nice it's unsourced

762.82 --> 770.08
and also yeah kind of a unexpected

767.31 --> 772.15
detail about that is that yeah when I

770.08 --> 774.01
use this in a joint I kind of do have to

772.15 --> 776.35
keep lighting it up because it just does

774.01 --> 779.77
not know ya automatically keep on burnin

776.35 --> 782.02
because there's no sauce in it but it's

779.77 --> 787.3
good tobacco I've tried it a couple of

782.02 --> 791.26
times already and like I'm noticing it's

787.3 --> 794.1999999999999
much better in the aftertaste situation

791.26 --> 794.98
I really do so yeah I'm kind of happy

794.2 --> 798.07
about that

794.98 --> 802.33
I got raw tobacco and it's gonna be it's

798.07 --> 806.58
so much man it's so insanely much like

802.33 --> 813.85
I'm gonna have at least enough until

806.58 --> 816.76
somewhere 2021 pretty sure who's

813.85 --> 819.64
Roderigo Roderigo Ferrari Nunez he's

816.76 --> 824.41
also I think part of the globe Buster's

819.64 --> 830.47
crew and he does his own thing he's a

824.41 --> 834.0699999999999
good guy and he's very like he is he's

830.47 --> 837.37
like sensitive and wise type that type

834.07 --> 841.1500000000001
so I always rip riche e8 his input and

837.37 --> 843.78
he's very detailed let me see how I

841.15 --> 843.78
linked him

850.17 --> 861.87
all right so this is the video that I

857.94 --> 864.6
watched this morning and yet you can use

861.87 --> 866.25
a deceptive channel yeah he does I don't

864.6 --> 869.85
think he does daily things but it's a

866.25 --> 871.08
good it's a good channel he would be

869.85 --> 873.99
great as a guest

871.08 --> 877.08
yeah yeah sure if he would want to come

873.99 --> 879.33
on my show I think he would be a great

877.08 --> 883.2800000000001
guest although I don't know if yeah this

879.33 --> 885.87
timeslot is very convenient for him

883.28 --> 889.65
because if I'm not mistaken he is in

885.87 --> 895.29
South America so this is going to be

889.65 --> 899.43
very early for him but sure yes yeah my

895.29 --> 901.68
door is open my guest door for the show

899.43 --> 904.2199999999999
is definitely open for him if he would

901.68 --> 904.2199999999999
want to join

910.21 --> 913.99
right yeah Amanda young if you've never

912.279 --> 916.42
seen him you're really gonna love his

913.99 --> 919.71
intro and outro he's done this thing

916.42 --> 925.3199999999999
where he basically takes NASA

919.71 --> 928.2090000000001
advertisements and then speaks over it

925.32 --> 930.22
giving it a context of where they're

928.209 --> 933.67
basically being honest about fooling

930.22 --> 935.74
everyone but it's really well done like

933.67 --> 938.5
he D put some attention to that it's

935.74 --> 940.87
pretty incredible like every time I hear

938.5 --> 950.44
it's like wow that is so that's just

940.87 --> 959.43
uncanny he did not interview you pour

950.44 --> 959.4300000000001
what prior

960.11 --> 965.96
yeah I know but East look the guys even

962.78 --> 971.06
been kind of honest like he thought I

965.96 --> 973.7
was kind of weird like like he had I

971.06 --> 976.31
think he had some suspicious because of

973.7 --> 980.3900000000001
my background yeah and the things that

976.31 --> 982.52
I'm relatively open about so I don't

980.39 --> 986.03
know but I've been like in his chat too

982.52 --> 989.09
and he's very sympathetic he he's not

986.03 --> 991.5799999999999
trying to avoid me or anything so yeah I

989.09 --> 993.85
think this could work it just took some

991.58 --> 993.85
time

999.51 --> 1005.269
right and hey I have a daily show now so

1002.24 --> 1007.699
there's a lot more of me out there for

1005.269 --> 1018.32
him to figure it out like Who am I

1007.699 --> 1020.779
really in yeah but yeah I I it'd be

1018.32 --> 1023.23
great if I could join him on his show

1020.779 --> 1023.23
sometime

1023.98 --> 1031.91
he's logos yeah yeah he is he's very

1028.309 --> 1034.37
careful new father

1031.91 --> 1036.559
Oh God my yeah reminds me everybody in

1034.37 --> 1041.7399999999998
the freaking world as a kid but me I

1036.559 --> 1041.74
know everybody

1044.92 --> 1048.059
[Music]

1063.27 --> 1091.53
it's alright just being I'm just being

1069.18 --> 1094.8300000000002
40 alright anyway yeah haven't really

1091.53 --> 1096.96
made any new drawings although I have

1094.83 --> 1100.32
been just continually looking back at

1096.96 --> 1106.77
this drawing being kind of impressed by

1100.32 --> 1108.8999999999999
it it's interesting because the more I'm

1106.77 --> 1111.11
able to like draw these things just

1108.9 --> 1114.45
sketch it out the more I realize is that

1111.11 --> 1118.8
okay if I can make it officially halfway

1114.45 --> 1120.21
sensible then maybe I could 3d model it

1118.8 --> 1123.21
at some point you know I've even

1120.21 --> 1125.1000000000001
considered like I could do a trick it

1123.21 --> 1129.54
would be a trick a trick to try to

1125.1 --> 1133.5
emulate the effect of the globe of the

1129.54 --> 1136.44
heavens okay this is complicated so what

1133.5 --> 1138.21
if it's kind of based on what I realized

1136.44 --> 1139.8600000000001
about this drawing yesterday is that

1138.21 --> 1146.01
like okay as long as you remain within

1139.86 --> 1150.24
the tube you're going to just see the

1146.01 --> 1152.01
daylight from that specific angle and if

1150.24 --> 1154.71
you go too high then you don't see it

1152.01 --> 1157.11
anymore and also the rest of the stars

1154.71 --> 1159.51
will probably also fade so yeah you

1157.11 --> 1164.52
could make this literally into a virtual

1159.51 --> 1167.25
zone where yeah the more you evade from

1164.52 --> 1170.31
it spatially like you have a camera view

1167.25 --> 1172.92
within the 3d simulation and as when it

1170.31 --> 1177.9299999999998
goes further away that literally the

1172.92 --> 1181.5600000000002
backdrop lights will fade out so I could

1177.93 --> 1183.42
I could work with that it's like instead

1181.56 --> 1186.48
of having just a standard globe of the

1183.42 --> 1191.43
heavens doing its thing always you could

1186.48 --> 1193.83
have a yet a difference between places

1191.43 --> 1194.8400000000001
where it would manifest and where it

1193.83 --> 1198.1399999999999
would fade and

1194.84 --> 1200.6599999999999
that way kind of tried to simulate what

1198.14 --> 1203.96
it would be like in the realm to

1200.66 --> 1207.7900000000002
experience that yeah

1203.96 --> 1211.19
although meet some pretty good 3d

1207.79 --> 1215.6299999999999
engineers because before I'll be able to

1211.19 --> 1218.89
do such a task such a feat so I don't

1215.63 --> 1218.89
see that coming anytime soon

1222.58 --> 1231.31
what of the concept that the moon is

1225.77 --> 1235.16
actually a portal oh well spiritually

1231.31 --> 1238.19
right and this is the weird thing like

1235.16 --> 1240.68
even my healer kind of rests upon these

1238.19 --> 1244.18
concept and that is that suppose with

1240.68 --> 1248.8400000000001
planets stars and all that dead

1244.18 --> 1254.47
celestial things may actually be portals

1248.84 --> 1257.72
but not physical ones but more like a a

1254.47 --> 1263.33
fourth dimensional boy it's like in the

1257.72 --> 1266.42
3d world it's just light but through yes

1263.33 --> 1268.85
your spirit may actually Zone in on the

1266.42 --> 1272.69
star and then have a contact with a

1268.85 --> 1276.02
correlating frequency in that sense in

1272.69 --> 1279.44
that sense yeah the pool the moon could

1276.02 --> 1283.6
be a portal of some sorts the spiritual

1279.44 --> 1286.04
portal but it's not a physical portal

1283.6 --> 1287.87
because it's not an object and it

1286.04 --> 1290.21
doesn't have a literal location only in

1287.87 --> 1292.57
an apparent one in relation to the

1290.21 --> 1292.57
observer

1304.2 --> 1311.47
did I go through check yet I think I

1307.48 --> 1315.01
completely forgot hmm let's do it now

1311.47 --> 1318.97
okay I think Robinson ATM was first he

1315.01 --> 1325.99
was first before that Robin Stanley a

1318.97 --> 1335.88
man a young good servant sorry the

1325.99 --> 1335.88
Cosentino hello Neal the sleeping Kraken

1336.12 --> 1346.7399999999998
who's that

1338.47 --> 1346.74
eyes wide shut Christopher Newton

1351.31 --> 1362.31
good servant yeah I think yeah doesn't I

1354.76 --> 1362.31
know but it's good good enough

1364.63 --> 1377.5
right anyway was I right the 3d model to

1374.46 --> 1381.31
potentially emulate what it is like to

1377.5 --> 1382.96
experience the holographic effects of

1381.31 --> 1385.3
the globe of the heavens within a

1382.96 --> 1388.1200000000001
simulation I think it could

1385.3 --> 1392.3799999999999
theoretically be done in order to get

1388.12 --> 1395.56
closer to simulating real worlds visual

1392.38 --> 1398.3700000000001
experiences to get closer to

1395.56 --> 1398.37
understanding it

1412.629 --> 1421.119
shayok Patel what loop-de-loop think

1416.839 --> 1421.119
that looping the word looping is funny I

1421.419 --> 1428.69
think it's it's better as a joke than to

1427.159 --> 1433.1490000000001
try to figure out that it might actually

1428.69 --> 1433.1490000000001
be a real part of their own

1449.75 --> 1457.21
what the sleeping warrior interview with

1452.42 --> 1461.18
the math kid was on Fe tour in Europe I

1457.21 --> 1468.8
really I don't remember that

1461.18 --> 1473.8400000000001
oh you will stick with what the Bible

1468.8 --> 1480.9199999999998
says so does the Bible mention a barrier

1473.84 --> 1486.29
that you will physically bump into right

1480.92 --> 1492.46
Jarek Patel because I'm also sticking to

1486.29 --> 1492.46
the Bible yeah I am

1493.69 --> 1501.49
so got a weird feeling that I'm being

1498.14 --> 1501.49
straw man here

1514.63 --> 1522.8300000000002
or unless Schirach patel could I don't

1520.49 --> 1526.79
know deliver me some proof that the

1522.83 --> 1531.8
earth is a disc with a physical dome

1526.79 --> 1535.22
over it and if you go shouts far enough

1531.8 --> 1538.49
bowing you're gonna bump into a physical

1535.22 --> 1542.8600000000001
dome of glass or whatever the [ __ ]

1538.49 --> 1542.86
people think it is all right

1551.66 --> 1561.6200000000001
do I know what Mystery Babylon is yeah

1555.35 --> 1563.74
pretty much yeah it is the picture it is

1561.62 --> 1566.27
yeah it's basically the work of fiction

1563.74 --> 1569.8700000000001
it is to keep it going you could

1566.27 --> 1580.15
consider that the Ilia centric cosmology

1569.87 --> 1583.4899999999998
is like part of Mystery Babylon it's

1580.15 --> 1587.1100000000001
it's the consistent light to replace

1583.49 --> 1592.3700000000001
reality if I'm not mistaken right

1587.11 --> 1594.9499999999998
so she rock but are you saying that my

1592.37 --> 1598.1
conceptions about what the realm could

1594.95 --> 1601.96
be rectangular looping all that you're

1598.1 --> 1604.6999999999998
saying that that I am Babylon a car you

1601.96 --> 1607.6100000000001
you think I'm the Antichrist because I

1604.7 --> 1611.53
don't think it's a dome the dome on a

1607.61 --> 1611.53
disk do you

1620.7 --> 1631.17
it is America buddy common knowledge oh

1626.51 --> 1633.57
sure sure it is oh hey you know you

1631.17 --> 1635.3100000000002
could point at that country you could

1633.57 --> 1638.1499999999999
point at another country you could point

1635.31 --> 1641.1299999999999
at a group of people or you could simply

1638.15 --> 1644.2800000000002
describe the essence of what Mystery

1641.13 --> 1648.0
Babylon is and then reveal who is doing

1644.28 --> 1650.07
that who's doing that right now right

1648.0 --> 1654.69
you don't have to point at a freaking

1650.07 --> 1658.1699999999998
continent things can change things shift

1654.69 --> 1662.48
other people restart it up when it's

1658.17 --> 1662.48
fallen this is how it works

1673.48 --> 1680.92
absurd interpretation so absurd is it

1684.79 --> 1690.37
and I think we got a Bible sinfoni on

1687.13 --> 1694.0900000000001
our hands here I think this guy really

1690.37 --> 1696.8799999999999
thinks he knows all the truth every

1694.09 --> 1699.79
detail it knows exactly where he is and

1696.88 --> 1701.68
what is going on around him and he can

1699.79 --> 1705.33
just point and say that's it

1701.68 --> 1708.73
that is what the Bible said right there

1705.33 --> 1713.31
this is the person this is the country

1708.73 --> 1713.31
right you're one of those she wrote

1732.61 --> 1737.549
you are a bible literalist are you oh

1735.36 --> 1740.309
really

1737.549 --> 1744.94
well good luck with that you know

1740.309 --> 1747.94
exoteric SAR a real [ __ ] can get really

1744.94 --> 1752.5
lost in there you realize that right

1747.94 --> 1755.23
there's literally just wars been fought

1752.5 --> 1756.79
Oh for the exoteric interpretations of

1755.23 --> 1759.46
the Bible and the philosophical

1756.79 --> 1765.85
consequences all right you do realize

1759.46 --> 1772.0
that right yeah no I am a Bible esoteric

1765.85 --> 1774.9699999999998
I mean I mean yeah I mean as a terrorist

1772.0 --> 1778.24
ie look don't look exoteric I look at

1774.97 --> 1780.79
the essence what is going on what is

1778.24 --> 1782.89
that what does it describe don't have to

1780.79 --> 1785.77
freaking point it down on a map or

1782.89 --> 1789.3300000000002
something know the essence so you

1785.77 --> 1795.94
recognize the essence wherever you are

1789.33 --> 1798.1599999999999
in your time that's what I do and I am

1795.94 --> 1801.22
indeed like Robert Stanley says also

1798.16 --> 1803.14
christ-centered that is that I pay the

1801.22 --> 1807.64
most attention to the frequency of

1803.14 --> 1810.76
Christ just his acts his words and not

1807.64 --> 1815.919
some freakin cult that will interpret

1810.76 --> 1821.3799999999999
that to no end me I feel it I feel him I

1815.919 --> 1823.72
make sense of him I don't care what some

1821.38 --> 1824.8300000000002
study priest really have to has to say

1823.72 --> 1827.29
about it even though it can be

1824.83 --> 1830.3799999999999
interesting to see how the exit Eric's

1827.29 --> 1832.6
up to a very far degree do connect

1830.38 --> 1834.7600000000002
together that's probably one of the more

1832.6 --> 1838.2099999999998
miraculous things about it

1834.76 --> 1843.49
right but the essence the a satiric side

1838.21 --> 1846.21
of it yeah that's that's what I think

1843.49 --> 1846.21
it's really about

1847.09 --> 1856.54
it's just understanding the design what

1853.63 --> 1860.41
do you do when you want to do it the

1856.54 --> 1865.17
right way what does that mean how how do

1860.41 --> 1870.43
you really do it and especially like why

1865.17 --> 1876.01
why did he do the things he did the time

1870.43 --> 1880.0
that he did all that and I think that

1876.01 --> 1884.74
Christ also mentioned enough gave enough

1880.0 --> 1887.08
reasons basically for his actions why is

1884.74 --> 1891.16
there a 33 my email address because I

1887.08 --> 1893.79
like 33 33 is a good number for me I

1891.16 --> 1893.7900000000002
like it

1894.51 --> 1906.28
there's a lot about 33 I had pretty

1900.55 --> 1911.59
tense moment when I was 33 33 is good

1906.28 --> 1917.44
unless you want to just screw around and

1911.59 --> 1921.58
then you can use that as a as a tag but

1917.44 --> 1924.1000000000001
yeah I'm speaking the truth that's what

1921.58 --> 1926.26
I do that's what I'm doing that's that's

1924.1 --> 1930.3999999999999
just the way I conduct myself I'm not a

1926.26 --> 1932.95
spin doctor I create and then I test and

1930.4 --> 1937.5300000000002
then I make mistakes and then I learn

1932.95 --> 1943.8400000000001
from the mistakes and so I'm using 33

1937.53 --> 1945.79
but I'm not deceiving so that should

1943.84 --> 1951.3999999999999
tell you something because it matters I

1945.79 --> 1953.3799999999999
think 33 my own intuition based is kind

1951.4 --> 1957.91
of like a power number but yeah that

1953.38 --> 1962.5300000000002
power number will only enhance whatever

1957.91 --> 1967.69
you are carrying and doing so if you are

1962.53 --> 1970.6299999999999
a deceiver yeah that will that will be

1967.69 --> 1973.53
risky if you tell the truth then it can

1970.63 --> 1973.5300000000002
strengthen you

1974.87 --> 1981.6599999999999
and do I open my panel up I don't really

1978.96 --> 1983.58
have a panel people can contact me on

1981.66 --> 1986.7900000000002
skype these Skype address is in the

1983.58 --> 1988.9499999999998
description box below the YouTube video

1986.79 --> 1990.24
and you can contact me there then we can

1988.95 --> 1992.91
talk hey if you want to have a

1990.24 --> 1996.24
discussion you want to be a guest on the

1992.91 --> 1998.64
show then contact me there and we can

1996.24 --> 2001.73
talk I will determine if you are

1998.64 --> 2010.13
suitable to have on the show and then

2001.73 --> 2014.26
yeah we'll see what that goes I'm glad

2010.13 --> 2014.2600000000002
you didn't turn out to be just a troll

2027.94 --> 2032.67
that Guns of Navarone RMP really

2039.66 --> 2044.64
right well the weird thing is Guns of

2041.55 --> 2046.1399999999999
Navarone aren't be in a way did this is

2044.64 --> 2051.69
complicated right

2046.14 --> 2054.03
so say ten years ago I know wait before

2051.69 --> 2057.21
that before that I was kind of like

2054.03 --> 2059.6290000000004
doing my own spiritual study but not

2057.21 --> 2063.12
from a Christ's perspective really

2059.629 --> 2065.1
though I didn't outright deny him I was

2063.12 --> 2069.12
just trying to figure out the other

2065.1 --> 2071.37
stuff and not get dragged down into deep

2069.12 --> 2076.3199999999997
darkness very made sure of that

2071.37 --> 2084.0899999999997
even though yeah kind of didn't left me

2076.32 --> 2088.02
unscarred eventually but spiritually but

2084.09 --> 2090.21
back then yeah I was just I was trying

2088.02 --> 2091.8
things out I was spiritually trying to

2090.21 --> 2094.52
discover things then I kind of got into

2091.8 --> 2095.639
Alex Jones woke up to more worldly

2094.52 --> 2099.81
situations

2095.639 --> 2103.32
yeah the Obama craziness went through

2099.81 --> 2105.5099999999998
through that with Alex Jones too and

2103.32 --> 2108.96
then started to discover about the

2105.51 --> 2112.6800000000003
nefarious cults basically that are going

2108.96 --> 2114.9900000000002
which before that I kind of like was

2112.68 --> 2118.62
trying to avoid because I had been

2114.99 --> 2122.5099999999998
indirect even saying I had been directly

2118.62 --> 2126.5699999999997
confronted with that in the past and

2122.51 --> 2130.8300000000004
absolutely unable to handle that right

2126.57 --> 2133.4100000000003
so I kind of like got afraid of 33 at

2130.83 --> 2136.11
that point because I realized like oh

2133.41 --> 2140.0299999999997
wow that can be like very much abused

2136.11 --> 2142.4700000000003
it's also the dark ones also use it and

2140.03 --> 2144.4500000000003
then when I got into flat earth

2142.47 --> 2147.5699999999997
I already realized like this is getting

2144.45 --> 2149.2799999999997
really complicated because there's like

2147.57 --> 2151.6200000000003
not just the light in the dark side now

2149.28 --> 2154.6200000000003
there is also the secret keepers and the

2151.62 --> 2156.27
secret reveals even though some secret

2154.62 --> 2158.3399999999997
keepers are pretending to be secret

2156.27 --> 2161.46
reveals and it's just it got really

2158.34 --> 2164.67
frickin complicated I got nervous then I

2161.46 --> 2167.07
just said okay screw this I'm just gonna

2164.67 --> 2169.38
do Flat Earth because I'm a Cosmo genius

2167.07 --> 2172.23
I got so many ideas I'm not even seeing

2169.38 --> 2175.56
a single freakin

2172.23 --> 2180.66
individual out there on the Internet in

2175.56 --> 2181.44
five years that has done anything like

2180.66 --> 2183.66
what I've done

2181.44 --> 2186.44
not a single one it's like they can't

2183.66 --> 2193.5299999999997
but they don't even know how to do this

2186.44 --> 2198.2400000000002
so I just got there did it and then I

2193.53 --> 2201.21
realized like yeah I like 33 I need I

2198.24 --> 2203.25
need like I need power to assist me

2201.21 --> 2205.7
I need momentum I need power I need

2203.25 --> 2209.79
everything I can get that isn't darkness

2205.7 --> 2213.6899999999996
like even money but not from creepy

2209.79 --> 2217.68
deals only from goodwill and I took my

2213.69 --> 2222.09
email address I went 33 kind of in a in

2217.68 --> 2229.5299999999997
an attempt to both overcome my own fear

2222.09 --> 2231.6800000000003
and to gain extra momentum and yeah I'm

2229.53 --> 2239.28
glad I did it

2231.68 --> 2242.58
I'm happy with my email address so there

2239.28 --> 2245.0
you go five minute talk about my email

2242.58 --> 2245.0
address

2248.8 --> 2254.52
it's 33 watching really huh all right a

2254.88 --> 2259.8
tank see you

2266.58 --> 2272.58
a Missouri bear to Wed away let's see

2270.18 --> 2275.18
that the partial lunar eclipse nope

2272.58 --> 2275.18
missed it

2281.19 --> 2285.92
is numerology biblical

2291.19 --> 2299.71
well look sherek patel i am familiar

2296.86 --> 2302.5
with the more exoteric familiar I'm not

2299.71 --> 2305.7400000000002
an expert with more exoteric things

2302.5 --> 2307.24
concerning the Bible because yeah I know

2305.74 --> 2310.6299999999997
a couple of people one of them being

2307.24 --> 2313.7799999999997
Bible literalist that's that's her name

2310.63 --> 2316.62
now who's been doing this her entire

2313.78 --> 2321.4500000000003
life pretty much she does live streams I

2316.62 --> 2325.12
think on Monday if I'm not mistaken

2321.45 --> 2327.04
pretty good studies she's done a lot of

2325.12 --> 2328.63
work so hey if you're really into that

2327.04 --> 2335.95
why don't you check her childhood

2328.63 --> 2339.2400000000002
channel out Bible literalist yeah Paula

2335.95 --> 2343.47
is a library Bible literalist this is

2339.24 --> 2343.47
are you [ __ ] me buddy

2365.81 --> 2372.65
oh right okay well right well that's

2369.53 --> 2374.3900000000003
because you're wrong this doesn't mean

2372.65 --> 2376.19
that there is no such thing as

2374.39 --> 2385.37
reincarnation but the Bible doesn't

2376.19 --> 2395.18
teach that unless you like to give us

2385.37 --> 2397.58
some quotations but yeah she is a viable

2395.18 --> 2400.3599999999997
literalist and she doesn't like it when

2397.58 --> 2403.52
people just assert these weird things

2400.36 --> 2405.86
you know unless you are oh yeah that's

2403.52 --> 2409.43
nice okay so the next thing you're gonna

2405.86 --> 2411.98
type in is the Bible verse that supports

2409.43 --> 2415.5099999999998
that reincarnation is real or you're

2411.98 --> 2415.51
blocked how about that

2422.16 --> 2428.45
if you're going to be like that present

2425.279 --> 2428.45
it right now

2450.55 --> 2462.76
cool so Jesus set reincarnation really

2456.09 --> 2467.7400000000002
that is fascinating that's kind of funny

2462.76 --> 2469.9300000000003
then that it would still be ruled out

2467.74 --> 2472.0499999999997
even though Jesus himself talked about

2469.93 --> 2472.0499999999997
it

2480.0 --> 2484.47
all right well at least you you did

2482.55 --> 2486.71
actually support your claim there that's

2484.47 --> 2486.7099999999996
good

2492.66 --> 2498.7
why do I have no idea what Matthew 1114

2496.03 --> 2499.869
is because I'm not a Bible code kind of

2498.7 --> 2508.96
guy like at all

2499.869 --> 2511.57
not even close yeah you know what maybe

2508.96 --> 2516.869
I'll be able goggle it I'm gonna Google

2511.57 --> 2516.869
the Bible verse so proud

2525.7 --> 2530.6499999999996
and if you are willing to accept he is

2528.43 --> 2535.8089999999997
the Alaia

2530.65 --> 2542.039
Elijah who was to come okay

2535.809 --> 2542.039
that it that's it

2547.44 --> 2550.25
really

2559.599 --> 2564.3900000000003
okay so he was reincarnated

2581.49 --> 2589.25
okay that is weird I don't know if that

2584.79 --> 2589.25
literally supports reincarnation though

2595.4 --> 2601.4500000000003
John Baptist will come at the end times

2597.95 --> 2601.45
okay that sounds interesting

2604.84 --> 2609.28
I'm not a meek and what are you posting

2627.48 --> 2630.2
hmm

2640.33 --> 2646.48
all right okay well thank you yeah that

2644.89 --> 2647.77
that PDF was actually kind of

2646.48 --> 2651.07
interesting I might read through that

2647.77 --> 2653.29
annum but I don't know does that mean

2651.07 --> 2657.4
that reincarnation is supposedly

2653.29 --> 2662.11
literally the same or is it rather just

2657.4 --> 2663.84
I don't know the same formation is it

2662.11 --> 2668.26
really suggested that it is the the

2663.84 --> 2671.53
prior experience incarnated or is it

2668.26 --> 2677.0400000000004
just the spirit basically reforming from

2671.53 --> 2679.4500000000003
scratch the same spirit what do they say

2677.04 --> 2682.24
is it like the next step in a journey

2679.45 --> 2683.95
because that is really that would be

2682.24 --> 2685.72
more reincarnation but that would kind

2683.95 --> 2687.43
of contradict well yeah being Souls

2685.72 --> 2691.6
waiting in line although yeah I Finn the

2687.43 --> 2694.48
past said okay yeah sure you die you go

2691.6 --> 2697.0299999999997
in outside the physical realm in the

2694.48 --> 2699.31
fourth dimension or whatever and then

2697.03 --> 2700.3300000000004
you could potentially reincarnate if

2699.31 --> 2703.33
that's allowed

2700.33 --> 2706.27
it could be reborn like if it's allowed

2703.33 --> 2708.7599999999998
I don't even know how that's supposed to

2706.27 --> 2711.61
work God just gives you permission to do

2708.76 --> 2713.7000000000003
that or just makes you do that I don't

2711.61 --> 2713.7000000000003
know

2717.54 --> 2725.73
yeah but dude she rock when Christ says

2721.81 --> 2728.5
born again you know that's also

2725.73 --> 2731.17
terminology that has to do with yeah

2728.5 --> 2733.27
born again in Christ and all that that's

2731.17 --> 2735.9
not necessarily pointing at

2733.27 --> 2735.9
reincarnation

2773.58 --> 2776.36
okay

2787.94 --> 2795.299
right well this is kind of out of my

2790.2 --> 2798.4199999999996
league guys but hey I'm I'm okay with it

2795.299 --> 2800.97
I yeah exactly Robin Stanley I like what

2798.42 --> 2803.309
is reincarnation like how do you define

2800.97 --> 2805.8799999999997
it is it being reborn is it like a

2803.309 --> 2808.9500000000003
special designation from the Creator

2805.88 --> 2811.829
like okay you will specifically come

2808.95 --> 2817.23
back or you will walk through this time

2811.829 --> 2819.9300000000003
gate and riri emerge in the future or is

2817.23 --> 2822.119
that reincarnation like reincarnation

2819.93 --> 2824.6699999999996
really does suggest that there is just

2822.119 --> 2827.279
an infinite spirit cycle that keeps on

2824.67 --> 2829.529
going until the individual ascends in

2827.279 --> 2832.829
their spirit to a certain level where

2829.529 --> 2835.319
they no longer have to now is that the

2832.829 --> 2839.4300000000003
form that is suggested to be what is

2835.319 --> 2841.109
described or is it not because I have

2839.43 --> 2847.859
not literally seen the word

2841.109 --> 2851.279
reincarnation so far you're calling it

2847.859 --> 2860.19
reincarnation versus is that literally

2851.279 --> 2863.069
reincarnation right at a Meakin yes this

2860.19 --> 2866.849
stuff is complex but yes she ROC seems

2863.069 --> 2869.15
to be very set in his mind on how things

2866.849 --> 2869.15
are

2893.47 --> 2898.81
all right yeah well that's no excuse

2896.2 --> 2900.2799999999997
your act if you're a Bible scholar and

2898.81 --> 2904.75
it doesn't mean that you should have

2900.28 --> 2907.84
your mind set you should realize that

2904.75 --> 2911.43
there's probably thinks that you have

2907.84 --> 2915.84
overlooked despite your preponderate

2911.43 --> 2915.8399999999997
preponderance of reading and knowledge

2917.4 --> 2921.15
which account is that

2953.08 --> 2957.64
okay well if you're not gonna tell me

2955.09 --> 2962.6400000000003
what your other account name is then I'm

2957.64 --> 2962.64
not gonna unblock it Oh mind oh god oh

2965.43 --> 2972.99
right yeah no I'm not gonna block you

2970.78 --> 2972.9900000000002
buddy

2974.36 --> 2981.4500000000003
[Music]

2984.23 --> 2988.039
[Music]

3027.71 --> 3036.14
right so yeah this guy has his own

3029.9 --> 3039.829
opinions very pronounced yet yeah you

3036.14 --> 3041.7799999999997
haven't really backed up a lot and

3039.829 --> 3044.8900000000003
that's typically how you would get

3041.78 --> 3049.01
blocked by paula bible it realist

3044.89 --> 3051.2
because you're kind of arrogant like not

3049.01 --> 3053.5690000000004
kind of you're really arrogant and

3051.2 --> 3056.3489999999997
you're being like that right now it's

3053.569 --> 3059.7799999999997
just that I haven't really pushed it yes

3056.349 --> 3062.5
since I know who you are now it all

3059.78 --> 3065.869
makes sense right so you have very

3062.5 --> 3067.599
pronounced ideas about how this how it

3065.869 --> 3071.589
all works and how the Bible is right

3067.599 --> 3077.03
well you haven't really supported it

3071.589 --> 3078.77
you just have stories and parts that you

3077.03 --> 3083.1800000000003
put together that you think makes

3078.77 --> 3084.339
perfect sense well I don't from what

3083.18 --> 3087.74
I've seen from you

3084.339 --> 3089.869
what then again hey there there are some

3087.74 --> 3092.0589999999997
slight open ends it's the very reason

3089.869 --> 3098.599
why I'm not a Bible literalist but an

3092.059 --> 3101.6600000000003
esse terrorist because I don't think ya

3098.599 --> 3104.63
that I don't think I basically think

3101.66 --> 3107.7799999999997
that the the majority of people that

3104.63 --> 3113.119
bend over the Bible and go through paths

3107.78 --> 3117.1090000000004
get things wrong yeah I don't need you

3113.119 --> 3120.26
to add me on skype buddy I know who you

3117.109 --> 3122.5
are now yeah you're not gumming on my

3120.26 --> 3122.5
show

3140.75 --> 3143.789
[Music]

3165.16 --> 3176.2
right hey let's look from an esoteric

3170.49 --> 3179.109
perspective I would say yeah totally the

3176.2 --> 3181.299
earth realm from an esoteric perspective

3179.109 --> 3185.2
from a spirit experience perspective

3181.299 --> 3189.28
from a fourth-dimensional perspective is

3185.2 --> 3192.27
both heaven and hell partially not

3189.28 --> 3199.51
literal heaven because literal heaven

3192.27 --> 3202.599
you can't touch that within life and if

3199.51 --> 3205.69
yeah and if there is a literal hell then

3202.599 --> 3208.539
neither with that but you will be able

3205.69 --> 3210.67
to experience it and you'll be able to

3208.539 --> 3213.25
turn your life into a hell or into a

3210.67 --> 3217.51
heaven but with flaws because we're

3213.25 --> 3220.599
always a balance always can't have one

3217.51 --> 3223.059
without the other in some way you can do

3220.599 --> 3230.02
things perfect and then your ego will

3223.059 --> 3233.369
ruin it so there's always a balance in

3230.02 --> 3233.369
the earthly realm

3242.66 --> 3250.8689999999997
but yeah this realm itself is not hell

3246.289 --> 3254.809
not literally or who knows maybe

3250.869 --> 3258.859
originally like in archaic times they

3254.809 --> 3261.17
did call it hell maybe that was like one

3258.859 --> 3266.45
of the first names it had before they

3261.17 --> 3268.16
just called it earth because when I

3266.45 --> 3271.8489999999997
think about it yeah calling the realm

3268.16 --> 3273.92
earth seems like they just asked farmers

3271.849 --> 3275.509
like okay farmers you decide what we're

3273.92 --> 3277.339
gonna call this realm because we don't

3275.509 --> 3279.41
want to call it hell anymore because we

3277.339 --> 3283.359
yeah it had some issues with that and

3279.41 --> 3286.519
they're like well I work in the earth

3283.359 --> 3290.71
let's just call it earth I don't know

3286.519 --> 3290.7099999999996
I'm just blabbering at this point

3317.07 --> 3329.55
oh well look the Bible gatekeeper is

3324.24 --> 3332.3399999999997
kind of redundant in the sense that if

3329.55 --> 3335.3700000000003
you're yeah you can't really Bible keep

3332.34 --> 3337.9500000000003
somebody you know if you can just get a

3335.37 --> 3339.48
Bible 500 years ago yeah it would be

3337.95 --> 3341.5099999999998
tough you know because you weren't

3339.48 --> 3343.71
allowed to have one or if you'd had one

3341.51 --> 3346.4100000000003
you wouldn't be able to read it so you

3343.71 --> 3348.2400000000002
would be up go to the priest who would

3346.41 --> 3351.1499999999996
be able to read it and tell you how it

3348.24 --> 3353.7299999999996
is nowadays you could just buy it in any

3351.15 --> 3356.58
language in all kinds of varieties so

3353.73 --> 3359.01
what's a Bible gatekeeper it's useless

3356.58 --> 3361.02
if somebody wants to read it wants to

3359.01 --> 3364.65
figure it out they can nobody's gonna

3361.02 --> 3366.18
get keep them know the gatekeepers for

3364.65 --> 3371.76
the people

3366.18 --> 3374.5499999999997
I don't wanna it's too difficult I don't

3371.76 --> 3376.7700000000004
trust my own experience I'm gonna go to

3374.55 --> 3379.05
the guy that's gonna tell me how it is

3376.77 --> 3381.54
that's what they're there for

3379.05 --> 3384.8700000000003
they're not effective gatekeepers

3381.54 --> 3388.59
because anyone can get a Bible now you

3384.87 --> 3392.81
know a gatekeeper is has the gate to

3388.59 --> 3395.6400000000003
move beyond under lock and their control

3392.81 --> 3403.79
there is no control of this Bibles

3395.64 --> 3403.79
anyone can get a Bible so no you cannot

3434.07 --> 3439.02
all right it's time for you to go

3506.88 --> 3512.58
right I agree Reuben Stanley look the

3510.45 --> 3519.8999999999996
whole point about being a Christian is

3512.58 --> 3523.0499999999997
that you don't attack you defend you

3519.9 --> 3527.28
defend properly like you don't attack so

3523.05 --> 3529.02
yeah if you're a Bible Sivan yay like

3527.28 --> 3532.2000000000003
mind of God

3529.02 --> 3536.09
I almost literally invented the word

3532.2 --> 3539.37
Bible Sivan yay because of you buddy

3536.09 --> 3543.98
you were the Bible savonia I literally

3539.37 --> 3546.93
merge those words because of you okay

3543.98 --> 3548.37
right so Bible sarvagna is constantly

3546.93 --> 3551.1499999999996
attack everyone they're always

3548.37 --> 3553.74
undermining everybody else's authority

3551.15 --> 3556.17
concerning how they interpret things in

3553.74 --> 3557.9399999999996
the Bible because they secretly they

3556.17 --> 3560.61
want to be the secret King they want to

3557.94 --> 3563.07
be the secret priest basically not the

3560.61 --> 3565.02
secret King the secret priests that's

3563.07 --> 3566.88
what a Bible savonia does they can't

3565.02 --> 3569.94
help it it's like a little demon that's

3566.88 --> 3574.98
caught caught them they have to do it

3569.94 --> 3577.25
and this guy is just doing that all the

3574.98 --> 3577.25
time

3588.44 --> 3592.4900000000002
it doesn't mean that you can't have a

3590.27 --> 3596.78
good discussion with him potentially

3592.49 --> 3600.9799999999996
like like his cell phone yay level is

3596.78 --> 3603.26
not even close to what for example right

3600.98 --> 3605.63
the hands serve on your level is you

3603.26 --> 3608.48
know he's not that bad but it's there

3605.63 --> 3611.06
and it's not a really nice combination

3608.48 --> 3613.55
when you combine that with somebody that

3611.06 --> 3616.069
thinks they're in the Bible literalists

3613.55 --> 3618.9500000000003
and all that that's just Bible souvenirs

3616.069 --> 3623.21
are just not great there

3618.95 --> 3628.3999999999996
I find them disturbing they fall under

3623.21 --> 3633.109
the devil persecutors or they end up

3628.4 --> 3635.3
being like that always I was just making

3633.109 --> 3641.14
enemies just say no you are all false

3635.3 --> 3641.1400000000003
Christians while I'm the only one right

3641.5 --> 3649.49
it's the other guy's name I forgot maybe

3645.38 --> 3651.8900000000003
it's bad for the better but there was

3649.49 --> 3654.56
another guy who's much much more much

3651.89 --> 3656.5989999999997
worse a Bible symphonia than mind of God

3654.56 --> 3659.27
is but I forgot his name that's for the

3656.599 --> 3661.7000000000003
better because he was a really shitty

3659.27 --> 3664.28
troll guy that literally thought he was

3661.7 --> 3667.1899999999996
the only proper Christian in the entire

3664.28 --> 3674.02
world and everyone was Devils that was

3667.19 --> 3674.02
his real stance that's Bible so funny

3699.76 --> 3710.71
Jesus the Sun is with everyone why are

3704.08 --> 3713.35
you calling that Jesus how do you know

3710.71 --> 3716.62
that haven't we established that the Sun

3713.35 --> 3720.67
isn't even an object it's just a light

3716.62 --> 3729.46
apparition are you calling Jesus a light

3720.67 --> 3732.9300000000003
apparition hey if you'd say look the Sun

3729.46 --> 3736.15
is probably creations or God's most

3732.93 --> 3739.18
incredible miracle that we don't even

3736.15 --> 3741.15
yet understand how it's possible then

3739.18 --> 3745.7799999999997
yeah of course

3741.15 --> 3751.02
I'm going with that sure but to

3745.78 --> 3753.9700000000003
literally say like Jesus is the Sun that

3751.02 --> 3761.38
is what what's the name again

3753.97 --> 3765.1299999999997
that's what Gnostics do and yeah sure

3761.38 --> 3770.04
that that system is also integrated with

3765.13 --> 3772.62
in the in the Bible it's also there and

3770.04 --> 3776.56
there is some really interesting

3772.62 --> 3780.94
knowledge that can be figured out with

3776.56 --> 3784.63
that that doesn't mean that that is the

3780.94 --> 3787.06
real Christ and there is no person

3784.63 --> 3789.37
Christ like it was only a symbolized

3787.06 --> 3790.69
story because it was really the son yeah

3789.37 --> 3794.14
there are people out there that think

3790.69 --> 3796.18
like that when the first times I eat was

3794.14 --> 3800.37
even confronted with this concept was

3796.18 --> 3807.21
when I saw the movie zeitgeist way back

3800.37 --> 3810.37
and yeah I don't object to this system

3807.21 --> 3814.9
but the problem is that people that are

3810.37 --> 3817.81
on to that one bandwagon usually say no

3814.9 --> 3820.9300000000003
this is the only version that is real

3817.81 --> 3822.27
about it the literal things are not real

3820.93 --> 3825.52
not at all

3822.27 --> 3829.0
like he never existed it's only the Sun

3825.52 --> 3832.089
and the rest is just a story yeah those

3829.0 --> 3837.74
are some Gnostics that are just

3832.089 --> 3839.599
not with Christ so I'm against that but

3837.74 --> 3844.2799999999997
if you'd say yeah there's something to

3839.599 --> 3847.13
that story alongside Jesus Christ being

3844.28 --> 3849.77
the incarnation of God and having been

3847.13 --> 3851.089
in the past and all that then I'd say

3849.77 --> 3853.99
yeah sure no problem

3851.089 --> 3858.5589999999997
I've already he's put down very very

3853.99 --> 3861.6499999999996
widely I think there are many angles to

3858.559 --> 3864.55
approach the Bible and that they are all

3861.65 --> 3869.4500000000003
correct as long as you don't exclude

3864.55 --> 3873.369
things other approaches that's my

3869.45 --> 3873.3689999999997
philosophical opinion about that

3876.99 --> 3883.6189999999997
so just see it like this rough

3880.5 --> 3886.74
comparison you have the Bible or a big

3883.619 --> 3889.1400000000003
stack of books most expanded extensive

3886.74 --> 3892.0499999999997
version or whatever and you got seven

3889.14 --> 3893.49
people and they're all reading it in

3892.05 --> 3895.92
their own way and they're saying like

3893.49 --> 3897.0299999999997
look this this is what it means this is

3895.92 --> 3899.61
it this is it

3897.03 --> 3901.17
you should exclude that and then the

3899.61 --> 3904.35
other one says no no you're wrong it's

3901.17 --> 3906.54
this one see it's this thing you got it

3904.35 --> 3909.8689999999997
wrong and then each one of them are like

3906.54 --> 3911.25
no I'm right you're wrong and then

3909.869 --> 3914.61
they're basically just pulling on that

3911.25 --> 3916.619
Bible and ripping it apart eventually

3914.61 --> 3920.79
and maybe even starting fights and Wars

3916.619 --> 3923.34
and [ __ ] right so they were all wrong

3920.79 --> 3928.1
all of them because they didn't get the

3923.34 --> 3931.38
essence the essence the esoteric essence

3928.1 --> 3934.5299999999997
of what Christ was really saying the

3931.38 --> 3939.619
message what he went through what he

3934.53 --> 3939.619
showed is that you should not do that

3945.19 --> 3956.619
among other things also among yeah not

3951.809 --> 3961.51
giving your authority of God to another

3956.619 --> 3965.6400000000003
person being your own priest as it were

3961.51 --> 3969.099
and not yeah and with that like a church

3965.64 --> 3973.66
house where you go to be told what God

3969.099 --> 3975.789
is that's also not good you have to

3973.66 --> 3978.52
figure it out yourself and you can help

3975.789 --> 3980.98
one another and teach one another but

3978.52 --> 3984.849
it's you who has to figure it out you

3980.98 --> 3988.02
can't just take whatever the other is

3984.849 --> 3994.089
saying just as is without considering it

3988.02 --> 3996.67
without seeing if it's real or not you

3994.089 --> 3998.0389999999998
have to learn and that's a big part of

3996.67 --> 4001.02
Jesus's message

3998.039 --> 4003.3900000000003
so if ya people are gonna say no I got

4001.02 --> 4005.339
the ultimate interpretation of the Bible

4003.39 --> 4008.0389999999998
and the rest is all wrong you gotta

4005.339 --> 4011.819
follow me and we're gonna make war with

4008.039 --> 4014.48
all the other Bible interpreters yeah do

4011.819 --> 4017.4
you think Jesus would approve of that

4014.48 --> 4020.369
seriously just think about it you have

4017.4 --> 4022.5
this bizarro god-given time-traveling

4020.369 --> 4025.289
opportunity without any long-term

4022.5 --> 4027.859
consequences or just like a simulation

4025.289 --> 4030.69
parallel where you could just step into

4027.859 --> 4033.27
that time where Jesus was before it got

4030.69 --> 4036.51
crucified and just say like oh Jesus wow

4033.27 --> 4040.68
you're so important I look I found the

4036.51 --> 4046.3190000000004
way to interpret the Bible what do you

4040.68 --> 4048.5989999999997
think he'd be saying well first of all

4046.319 --> 4050.19
yeah you would have to realize that he

4048.599 --> 4052.17
would also be informed by God that

4050.19 --> 4054.539
somebody from the future is coming and

4052.17 --> 4057.029
all that and then he would respond like

4054.539 --> 4058.44
yeah you're you're just dwelling you

4057.029 --> 4062.01
know the whole Bible has already been

4058.44 --> 4064.109
made and re-engineered by people in

4062.01 --> 4065.9700000000003
contexts and all that and it's already

4064.109 --> 4068.22
nothing like what I really thought I'm

4065.97 --> 4071.73
glad that my message is at least still

4068.22 --> 4073.68
in there to be found but yeah you're

4071.73 --> 4076.2
wrong because you look at what you're

4073.68 --> 4077.7599999999998
doing you're attacking other people that

4076.2 --> 4079.89
try to follow me

4077.76 --> 4081.5400000000004
and because they're doing it slightly in

4079.89 --> 4084.45
a different way with different thoughts

4081.54 --> 4089.13
you're attacking them that's not right

4084.45 --> 4095.99
that's what he would say I'm certain of

4089.13 --> 4095.9900000000002
it I can feel it right

4098.01 --> 4101.109
[Music]

4107.02 --> 4111.71
that really in the end is all about

4109.489 --> 4116.388999999999
doing good and learning from your

4111.71 --> 4120.71
mistake don't be discouraged by dark

4116.389 --> 4123.319
influences try to outgrow it and that's

4120.71 --> 4129.2300000000005
really the essential core of the whole

4123.319 --> 4134.1990000000005
logos and Jesus put that down better

4129.23 --> 4134.199
than any figure I've ever read about

4153.81 --> 4159.6900000000005
what what's what is a blanket statement

4170.98 --> 4174.299
a brain artherton

4178.869 --> 4185.73
yeah you're out of here dude get the

4181.15 --> 4188.469
[ __ ] out you're a Bible Sivan yay

4185.73 --> 4190.839
looking for a fight trying to make us

4188.469 --> 4198.219
feel ashamed about how we deal with the

4190.839 --> 4200.199
Bible you're not with Christ not saying

4198.219 --> 4202.83
you'll never be but what you're doing is

4200.199 --> 4202.83
not

4219.439 --> 4230.499000000001
hmm yeah you timeout good servant he's

4223.34 --> 4234.169
already banned but yeah all religions

4230.499 --> 4236.86
personify the Sun blanket statement yeah

4234.169 --> 4236.86
I'd agree

4242.63 --> 4250.76
I think that most religions do that's I

4248.21 --> 4254.21
think at least do give the Sunnah

4250.76 --> 4256.969
typical position within the wider

4254.21 --> 4258.77
meaning of a religion or at least a lot

4256.969 --> 4260.57
of references and stories yeah because

4258.77 --> 4262.1900000000005
every single person in the world deals

4260.57 --> 4264.17
with the son unless they live their

4262.19 --> 4267.159
entire lives in the ground which I don't

4264.17 --> 4269.96
think there are any people that do that

4267.159 --> 4273.138999999999
so yeah the Sun is always going to be in

4269.96 --> 4277.33
there but to say it's centered around

4273.139 --> 4282.13
the Sun I don't know I don't think so

4277.33 --> 4282.13
it's usually more centered around people

4289.429 --> 4293.38
oh yeah right you understand me

4297.86 --> 4302.2
ah okay mine are certain thanks for the

4301.25 --> 4305.75
update

4302.2 --> 4308.45
yeah Kent Hovind likes to go after the

4305.75 --> 4317.38
atheists even though he is a fervent

4308.45 --> 4323.17
globe earther mind you like he is like

4317.38 --> 4323.17
ball bound like really heavily

4330.23 --> 4335.599999999999
yeah but he's not a good servant and I

4332.18 --> 4338.150000000001
think he's he's not for for a reason I

4335.6 --> 4341.900000000001
don't think it's just his mind I think

4338.15 --> 4343.58
he is into some freaky ball machination

4341.9 --> 4347.089999999999
deal [ __ ] there I think he got

4343.58 --> 4350.66
confronted like yeah we're gonna make it

4347.09 --> 4353.0
really difficult for you if you do not

4350.66 --> 4356.09
accept the freaking ball you can do

4353.0 --> 4358.88
anything you like as long it is is on a

4356.09 --> 4360.71
ball you can criticize anything as long

4358.88 --> 4364.04
as the earth is a ball because that's

4360.71 --> 4369.62
really what it seems like and way back

4364.04 --> 4372.32
in the day he kind of did like I guess

4369.62 --> 4377.5
consider ponder upon the concept of Flat

4372.32 --> 4377.5
Earth but he was just so he rejected it

4379.24 --> 4386.15
like permanently like he won't even

4382.97 --> 4389.72
consider it anymore he doesn't even want

4386.15 --> 4397.46
to talk about the arguments with that at

4389.72 --> 4399.4400000000005
all so I yeah it doesn't seem natural to

4397.46 --> 4401.3
me that he's like that I think he got

4399.44 --> 4404.8099999999995
really badly confront and you know he's

4401.3 --> 4411.67
already been to jail and [ __ ] for just

4404.81 --> 4416.4800000000005
his creationism situation you know an

4411.67 --> 4420.05
agent an agent for what for creationism

4416.48 --> 4423.169999999999
the guy is fought for creationism his

4420.05 --> 4425.150000000001
entire life its entire life he literally

4423.17 --> 4431.08
went to jail for that [ __ ] how is he an

4425.15 --> 4433.3099999999995
agent an agent for what for creationism

4431.08 --> 4434.86
he's not an agent for the ball he

4433.31 --> 4440.0
doesn't even talk about that

4434.86 --> 4441.86
he just wants he just will not entertain

4440.0 --> 4446.03
that the earth might not be a ball

4441.86 --> 4448.88
that's it that's not an agent does an

4446.03 --> 4451.73
agent constantly talks all day long

4448.88 --> 4454.04
about the ball and about how flat

4451.73 --> 4456.95
earthers are [ __ ] and how all their

4454.04 --> 4460.91
arguments don't work and how it is a

4456.95 --> 4463.37
ball he doesn't do that he just doesn't

4460.91 --> 4463.909
want to get in that the earth might be

4463.37 --> 4474.979
anything

4463.909 --> 4485.089999999999
by DePaul that's it is it a sin to eat

4474.979 --> 4489.889
meat I don't think so but yeah that you

4485.09 --> 4492.860000000001
know ask ask a vegan they'll tell you

4489.889 --> 4500.84
that Christ Himself was a vegan I don't

4492.86 --> 4503.57
know I don't know if he was I've heard

4500.84 --> 4505.669
that before I don't I don't know what do

4503.57 --> 4511.159
you guys think and I think he probably

4505.669 --> 4513.32
did eat like a I know meat soup or

4511.159 --> 4517.369
something at some point yeah I've heard

4513.32 --> 4520.4
that too that eating meat can actually

4517.369 --> 4522.65
suppress spiritual elements in way back

4520.4 --> 4524.989
I kind of even sort of tested that there

4522.65 --> 4527.989
is something to it you know eating meat

4524.989 --> 4533.749
especially a lot of it it's not really

4527.989 --> 4535.669
good for your system but if you have the

4533.749 --> 4539.03
right metabolism the right stuff in your

4535.669 --> 4542.09
guts and you like can really assimilate

4539.03 --> 4546.259999999999
the substances in the meats proteins

4542.09 --> 4549.650000000001
then it will really work so it I don't

4546.26 --> 4553.159000000001
think it's a sin to eat meat it's just a

4549.65 --> 4556.549999999999
sin to and gorge yourself gluttony

4553.159 --> 4558.379999999999
that's a sin hey and if you glutton

4556.55 --> 4561.349
yourself with meats though it's proven

4558.38 --> 4563.959
to be not very healthy not good for your

4561.349 --> 4570.679
system you people actually died from

4563.959 --> 4574.599
that congestion [ __ ] so is it a sin will

4570.679 --> 4577.84
you go to hell if you eat meat no way I

4574.599 --> 4577.84
don't believe so

4586.44 --> 4592.62
but I personally advise that if you like

4588.72 --> 4594.320000000001
me eating me then just don't eat too

4592.62 --> 4596.79
much

4594.32 --> 4599.2699999999995
make sure it's never the majority of

4596.79 --> 4599.2699999999995
your meal

4599.99 --> 4607.2
I'd say 1/3 max and that's what I do

4604.08 --> 4612.45
it's better and they even sometimes I

4607.2 --> 4617.76
have like dinner ready for making with

4612.45 --> 4619.83
meat and I just don't go for it like for

4617.76 --> 4622.41
example I got her I can still got a

4619.83 --> 4624.59
hamburger in the fridge I was supposed

4622.41 --> 4628.099999999999
to eat that yesterday and I was like

4624.59 --> 4630.84
nope I'm not gonna eat meat today

4628.1 --> 4633.21
it's just intuitively I've just felt

4630.84 --> 4635.55
like no I've had enough of that I don't

4633.21 --> 4636.63
need it now it's better if I don't it's

4635.55 --> 4638.43
purely intuitive

4636.63 --> 4641.01
there's no system behind it it just

4638.43 --> 4642.450000000001
happens and it's not the first time

4641.01 --> 4645.030000000001
that's had that's been happening to me

4642.45 --> 4648.36
like in the last year I've even said so

4645.03 --> 4650.99
before like I'm postponing this making

4648.36 --> 4653.37
this dinner for almost a week it's crazy

4650.99 --> 4656.16
sometimes it gets really annoying that I

4653.37 --> 4665.88
do that because I should just keep

4656.16 --> 4669.0599999999995
eating but yeah would it be a sin if you

4665.88 --> 4672.78
didn't eat meat it disrespected the food

4669.06 --> 4677.97
put there for us good point if you're

4672.78 --> 4681.0
yeah that that's an interesting one like

4677.97 --> 4684.12
if if the animal had been slaughtered

4681.0 --> 4687.77
for meat you got the meat and then it's

4684.12 --> 4692.43
wasted it rots or you throw it away

4687.77 --> 4696.38
yeah to me that feels like a sin it

4692.43 --> 4698.9400000000005
feels like wow I screwed it up and now I

4696.38 --> 4702.33
mean it's not even feeding me it's just

4698.94 --> 4708.259999999999
gonna brought that feels really shitty

4702.33 --> 4714.289
to me so

4708.26 --> 4716.030000000001
I don't know but even if if you if you

4714.289 --> 4717.768999999999
were like a vegetarian or something and

4716.03 --> 4720.65
in me was put in front of you with meat

4717.769 --> 4723.650000000001
on there because they didn't know well I

4720.65 --> 4726.079
I wouldn't throw that away I would just

4723.65 --> 4728.138999999999
separate it and then see like is there

4726.079 --> 4730.518999999999
maybe somebody else that wants this or

4728.139 --> 4733.46
stir like a dog or something I could

4730.519 --> 4737.5
give this to you know let's throw it

4733.46 --> 4737.5
away that's ridiculous

4742.06 --> 4751.650000000001
[Music]

4744.66 --> 4755.28
you know but yeah that's me and I have

4751.65 --> 4757.65
this weird inner sense maybe because I

4755.28 --> 4760.32
have been poor for some time that just

4757.65 --> 4763.32
throwing away food to me is a sin it's

4760.32 --> 4767.549999999999
not literally a sin but it feels like

4763.32 --> 4771.0599999999995
one and it's like ah this is ridiculous

4767.55 --> 4772.71
why is this food not been eaten why why

4771.06 --> 4776.76
didn't that work out like when other

4772.71 --> 4783.09
people would done a lot to get that that

4776.76 --> 4786.38
feels bad to me something will eat it at

4783.09 --> 4786.38
some point yeah that's a good point

4791.76 --> 4799.13
but I'd rather that it's that it would

4795.0 --> 4799.13
feed something and I would see it so

4799.79 --> 4808.71
yeah that's for example this is funny

4802.29 --> 4812.34
you know I eat bread for my like for my

4808.71 --> 4815.52
lunches typically but I always have some

4812.34 --> 4817.41
leftover bread now normal people would

4815.52 --> 4820.830000000001
just throw that in the garbage can right

4817.41 --> 4822.83
I never do that no I keep that [ __ ] it

4820.83 --> 4826.8
gets a bit messy something like this see

4822.83 --> 4829.32
just some leftovers and I leave it here

4826.8 --> 4831.570000000001
and then I give it to the birds so

4829.32 --> 4833.219999999999
nothing is wasted and they're really

4831.57 --> 4838.679999999999
happy with it it's good quality organic

4833.22 --> 4840.45
bread leftovers you know if I throw it

4838.68 --> 4842.58
in the trash then it might have landed

4840.45 --> 4844.26
up on some trash heap and then seagulls

4842.58 --> 4848.75
will probably have found it at some

4844.26 --> 4851.67
point maybe but yeah this way I know

4848.75 --> 4853.17
it's actually gonna be relatively fresh

4851.67 --> 4854.88
for those birds it's gonna feed them

4853.17 --> 4857.63
they're gonna be happy they know it's

4854.88 --> 4862.8
here so there's also like a personal

4857.63 --> 4866.28
bond concerning the location it's yeah

4862.8 --> 4869.3
it's just more it's more that I kind of

4866.28 --> 4869.3
get out of it that way

4882.02 --> 4885.580000000001
okay ISA my house key

4887.42 --> 4892.67
well that's the issue isn't it killed

4889.4 --> 4895.549999999999
humanely I'd be more concerned with

4892.67 --> 4900.05
animals bred for meat if they'd actually

4895.55 --> 4903.14
lived humanely like how they died you

4900.05 --> 4907.25
know in nature animals do not die

4903.14 --> 4910.52
humanely they rarely are although

4907.25 --> 4913.85
sometimes it does happen you know

4910.52 --> 4915.860000000001
for example lions typically slow choke

4913.85 --> 4918.89
their prey they don't rip them apart

4915.86 --> 4921.469999999999
they just stun them and then they kill

4918.89 --> 4923.39
them and eat them so it's in a way they

4921.47 --> 4926.84
are kinda you mean if you could call it

4923.39 --> 4928.52
that but yeah usually animals just have

4926.84 --> 4930.17
to run for it and they're all fighting

4928.52 --> 4934.81
for their life and it's gonna get messy

4930.17 --> 4939.89
it's gonna get painful that's reality so

4934.81 --> 4941.72
for me I think it's actually much more

4939.89 --> 4945.05
important like how did the animals live

4941.72 --> 4947.240000000001
what did they eat did they feel like

4945.05 --> 4949.46
they did they have the opportunity to

4947.24 --> 4951.95
actually feel like the animal they are

4949.46 --> 4954.35
were they able to express natural

4951.95 --> 4957.17
behavior and social behavior with the

4954.35 --> 4958.85
other animals did they have room could

4957.17 --> 4962.81
they walk outside could they actually

4958.85 --> 4965.4400000000005
eat natural plants from the ground you

4962.81 --> 4970.1
know these things are all also important

4965.44 --> 4971.32
to me more than even how they are

4970.1 --> 4973.97
slaughtered really

4971.32 --> 4975.32
although yeah it's there are so much

4973.97 --> 4978.31
certain ways of slaughtering that are

4975.32 --> 4978.3099999999995
pretty brutal

4988.47 --> 4992.63
ah it's a Mahal Sookie I don't know

4999.39 --> 5007.04
that I don't think so predators don't

5003.62 --> 5009.59
eat their prey when they are still alive

5007.04 --> 5011.99
because yeah you're not gonna bite

5009.59 --> 5016.76
you're not gonna chew on a back leg if

5011.99 --> 5019.4
they could subtly just kick you right so

5016.76 --> 5022.7
no that's not true but yeah they will

5019.4 --> 5024.71
damn well just eat a young right in

5022.7 --> 5028.24
front of the parents yeah they will do

5024.71 --> 5028.24
that that is true

5030.64 --> 5040.450000000001
some drew no it's risky

5046.17 --> 5051.6900000000005
and if they were literally not dead yet

5049.11 --> 5054.929
then they'd be so stunned and so under

5051.69 --> 5056.428999999999
adrenaline or just completely drugged

5054.929 --> 5059.31
out of their mind naturally from the

5056.429 --> 5063.4490000000005
pain and the fear that they would be too

5059.31 --> 5065.160000000001
high to really experience it anyway so I

5063.449 --> 5068.87
don't want to think about this this is

5065.16 --> 5068.87
getting really disgusting

5076.75 --> 5080.369
[Music]

5085.18 --> 5098.91
right Rainer Thornton it is yeah and

5099.48 --> 5104.58
yeah if you ever done it then you know

5101.86 --> 5107.0199999999995
it so Big Bear Owen Benjamin has

5104.58 --> 5111.2699999999995
actually slaughtered a couple of animals

5107.02 --> 5114.97
chickens eat chickens and even those

5111.27 --> 5120.34
they're kind of dumb and he just it felt

5114.97 --> 5129.490000000001
bad anyway so yeah he's testified about

5120.34 --> 5132.0
that it is very hard oh okay well [ __ ]

5129.49 --> 5132.0
off then

5147.439 --> 5152.9400000000005
nope

5149.86 --> 5152.94
not true

5180.54 --> 5189.21
no I don't free mind it I don't like or

5186.45 --> 5193.889999999999
dislike people based on their ideas

5189.21 --> 5195.96
I only dislike or have feelings in some

5193.89 --> 5202.83
sort of way towards them based on their

5195.96 --> 5205.64
behavior literally they hope people took

5202.83 --> 5205.64
note of that

5209.879 --> 5217.59
I don't like politicizing the concept

5214.05 --> 5221.099
you know a flat earth and globe it's

5217.59 --> 5226.32
being done but I hate that I'm literally

5221.099 --> 5229.769
I only give I like I only give really

5226.32 --> 5231.299999999999
about behavior and the social behavior

5229.769 --> 5241.129
and the attitude like how are you

5231.3 --> 5245.159000000001
responding right demanded you I agree

5241.129 --> 5252.449
hate is a strong word and I rarely use

5245.159 --> 5254.728999999999
it you know I only use it to express my

5252.449 --> 5257.909
extreme feelings of frustrations which

5254.729 --> 5259.889
I've testified that I have at times and

5257.909 --> 5262.079
then it's like really like a raging

5259.889 --> 5264.689
blizzard or yeah that's hate you feel

5262.079 --> 5266.6089999999995
hate with that but that's that's not

5264.689 --> 5270.749000000001
productive at all you should in your

5266.609 --> 5273.659000000001
calm normal state of being

5270.749 --> 5274.59
you should never hate never that's

5273.659 --> 5280.079
ridiculous

5274.59 --> 5281.669
it's a waste of your energy the right

5280.079 --> 5286.938999999999
problem suddenly it does reduce your

5281.669 --> 5286.939
power it feeds off it it burns it away

5310.56 --> 5318.990000000001
what's that guy a genuine sjw [ __ ] a

5315.36 --> 5321.2
[ __ ] like a really fucked-up one that

5318.99 --> 5323.969999999999
actually think because what hate speech

5321.2 --> 5326.16
exactly good seven it was maybe because

5323.97 --> 5329.52
we were just talking about Christianity

5326.16 --> 5331.95
and killing animals maybe and how that

5329.52 --> 5334.89
is and it just hurt his feelings because

5331.95 --> 5338.51
he's an sjw [ __ ] [ __ ] and he can't

5334.89 --> 5341.37
think beyond his traumatized

5338.51 --> 5343.530000000001
indoctrination he literally can't think

5341.37 --> 5346.53
beyond it he just can only see the tags

5343.53 --> 5349.05
of the subjects and that's what he was

5346.53 --> 5350.49
responding to because that's what it

5349.05 --> 5352.4400000000005
seemed to to me and that's why I

5350.49 --> 5360.03
instantly banned him until to get the

5352.44 --> 5362.339999999999
[ __ ] out here now but hate speech is a

5360.03 --> 5364.219999999999
Marxist terminology right so it's

5362.34 --> 5368.64
basically political subject so

5364.22 --> 5372.21
Christianity may be killing animals for

5368.64 --> 5375.9800000000005
food you know those are hate speech to

5372.21 --> 5378.12
these people that's what they think

5375.98 --> 5382.009999999999
that's what they've been conditioned

5378.12 --> 5382.01
with and they can't get out of that

5404.24 --> 5407.8589999999995
[Music]

5414.01 --> 5421.55
yeah if you want some hate speech you

5417.41 --> 5424.46
know buddy you want some hate speech to

5421.55 --> 5425.12
for your conditioning to respond to how

5424.46 --> 5431.06
about this

5425.12 --> 5434.75
I hate Marxism I will probably never

5431.06 --> 5437.84
arrest properly until I know that I've

5434.75 --> 5442.61
done everything in my power and beyond

5437.84 --> 5446.32
to ensure that every single trace every

5442.61 --> 5449.32
single trace of Marxism has been erased

5446.32 --> 5453.009999999999
from the world

5449.32 --> 5453.009999999999
there's your hate speech

5480.33 --> 5485.03
what am i doing today the same thing I

5483.69 --> 5491.24
do every day

5485.03 --> 5494.24
Ryanair Thorson take over the world

5491.24 --> 5494.24
conceptualization

5539.94 --> 5546.11
yeah yeah Marxism is an anti-human

5543.72 --> 5549.110000000001
skirts but it's also it feeds off

5546.11 --> 5549.11
desperation

5550.55 --> 5560.76
it literally is it it hits people it

5557.37 --> 5563.76
takes them over if they are so desperate

5560.76 --> 5566.7300000000005
that they are basically just giving into

5563.76 --> 5571.01
it instead of killing themselves this

5566.73 --> 5573.8099999999995
not even it's not even that far off

5571.01 --> 5578.7300000000005
because you can only surrender to that

5573.81 --> 5581.9400000000005
if you just don't give anything about

5578.73 --> 5585.509999999999
anything anymore the only way it works

5581.94 --> 5589.53
so it it's literally it feeds off

5585.51 --> 5593.46
desperation it needs orcs it needs

5589.53 --> 5596.84
people that have nothing or that think

5593.46 --> 5596.84
they have nothing left to lose

5601.659 --> 5605.888999999999
that people that have just lost their

5603.729 --> 5609.669
[ __ ] that's what they feed off and then

5605.889 --> 5611.889
the structure the the enforced social

5609.669 --> 5614.559
structure that is created top-down with

5611.889 --> 5616.929
in Marxist communities is what then

5614.559 --> 5619.2390000000005
carries them forth as they literally

5616.929 --> 5621.88
surrender their spiritual personal

5619.239 --> 5623.409
sovereignty because they don't want they

5621.88 --> 5626.86
can't handle it anymore so they just

5623.409 --> 5629.679
want to be drug along and told what to

5626.86 --> 5632.199
do and Marxism dust kind of work for

5629.679 --> 5637.979
that that's the problem so it is purely

5632.199 --> 5646.78
dependent on deluded and depressed

5637.979 --> 5649.030000000001
idiots - yeah - keep it going and to

5646.78 --> 5653.259999999999
push it further it's feeding on pure

5649.03 --> 5658.599
desperation and corporate power also

5653.26 --> 5661.360000000001
it's big don't forget the money there

5658.599 --> 5664.389
wasn't any money available to basically

5661.36 --> 5667.539
push to these Marxists these power deep

5664.389 --> 5669.579
these pawns in the field if there was no

5667.539 --> 5671.59
money to push towards them to make them

5669.579 --> 5673.36
do stuff to give them orders then

5671.59 --> 5675.099
nothing would happen either so it's a

5673.36 --> 5677.679
combination of people that are basically

5675.099 --> 5681.55
completely desperate and out of their

5677.679 --> 5685.209
minds and people that are insanely rich

5681.55 --> 5689.729
and that can use these people that have

5685.209 --> 5695.919
lost it as pawns using their money and

5689.729 --> 5700.979
that's what the Marxism is that's really

5695.919 --> 5704.949
the entire thing that's what it is and

5700.979 --> 5706.929
it works to just erode and destroy

5704.949 --> 5710.469
society and the more eroded and

5706.929 --> 5713.499
destroyed the society is the more people

5710.469 --> 5715.769
will grow up more quickly becoming

5713.499 --> 5719.4
desperate more quickly losing it

5715.769 --> 5722.769
realizing how [ __ ] the world is and

5719.4 --> 5724.089999999999
then they risk - just falling in line

5722.769 --> 5727.1990000000005
because what else are you gonna do

5724.09 --> 5729.4890000000005
you're already living in hell so just

5727.199 --> 5730.53
give them the reins and don't think

5729.489 --> 5734.69
about it anymore

5730.53 --> 5738.099999999999
that's what Marxism is and that's why

5734.69 --> 5742.129999999999
I'll probably never arrest properly

5738.1 --> 5747.25
until I know that all traces of Marxism

5742.13 --> 5752.57
in every form in every mind even are

5747.25 --> 5755.42
erased for all eternity if that is even

5752.57 --> 5760.16
possible by the way I don't know if it

5755.42 --> 5763.01
is it might literally be a spell that

5760.16 --> 5765.44
will rewrite through my the minds of men

5763.01 --> 5767.6
over and over again even if there was no

5765.44 --> 5775.54
book to read it from until the end of

5767.6 --> 5775.54
time it might be the Antichrist itself

5775.87 --> 5784.25
maybe that is what it is it's just that

5779.69 --> 5786.65
is it until it is stopped but we can't

5784.25 --> 5791.66
stop it only Christ

5786.65 --> 5794.78
should be able to stop it if that that

5791.66 --> 5797.23
metaphor that parallel is actual I don't

5794.78 --> 5797.23
know if it is

5803.449 --> 5809.82
yeah is it esoterics you know there's a

5806.849 --> 5814.02
look you can find when you approach

5809.82 --> 5815.849
things through esoterics this is

5814.02 --> 5840.3
typically what I do there's so much in

5815.849 --> 5845.09
there right good tea I don't hate it but

5840.3 --> 5845.09
I'm certainly not infatuated with money

5846.11 --> 5851.13
you know originally I kind of loved it

5850.139 --> 5853.92
because I thought I could do anything

5851.13 --> 5855.929
with it then when I got a lot of money I

5853.92 --> 5858.09
figured out you can't do it everything

5855.929 --> 5860.01
with it and people are actually gonna

5858.09 --> 5865.849
parasite on you then I really hated

5860.01 --> 5868.1990000000005
money now I am kind of like stabilizing

5865.849 --> 5870.079
finding a new way to get money and now I

5868.199 --> 5877.049999999999
figured out that money is actually

5870.079 --> 5880.7699999999995
purely neutral it really is but it's

5877.05 --> 5888.139
damn well prone to evil and abuse it's

5880.77 --> 5888.139
an easy seductive tool but it is neutral

5893.05 --> 5899.349
it's just a transaction right

5897.369 --> 5905.92
that's what money is it's a it's a

5899.349 --> 5908.139
transaction tool it's you know saying

5905.92 --> 5911.02
that somebody with too much money is

5908.139 --> 5913.54
just evil is like saying that well this

5911.02 --> 5915.52
guy has like ten times more goats than

5913.54 --> 5920.949
everybody else in the village so he must

5915.52 --> 5924.3
be evil right no you gotta figure out

5920.949 --> 5926.5
who is this person how what is he doing

5924.3 --> 5929.650000000001
what spirit is he carrying

5926.5 --> 5932.86
what is this long-term plan and that

5929.65 --> 5935.92
determines much more now if somebody is

5932.86 --> 5937.449
sitting on huge piles of money then it's

5935.92 --> 5939.7300000000005
always gonna be a question how did he

5937.449 --> 5941.7699999999995
get that huge pile of money in this

5939.73 --> 5944.098999999999
world and how did he manage to keep it

5941.77 --> 5947.079000000001
that big that is kind of suspicious

5944.099 --> 5950.77
right so it's more likely there some

5947.079 --> 5957.159
evil involved but it it is it shouldn't

5950.77 --> 5959.320000000001
be assumed per default should be figured

5957.159 --> 5961.48
out and then again there is the saying

5959.32 --> 5965.679
of course I thought it was Jesus himself

5961.48 --> 5968.379999999999
it's easier for a or ya for a camel to

5965.679 --> 5971.59
go through the needle of an eye than a

5968.38 --> 5973.36
wealthy than a rich man that should

5971.59 --> 5976.03
absolutely be kept in the back of our

5973.36 --> 5979.509999999999
minds it doesn't say they can't it just

5976.03 --> 5983.559
say it's easier it's a metaphor a galaxy

5979.51 --> 5985.360000000001
and this is why I love Jesus so much you

5983.559 --> 5987.309
can say no that means that if you have

5985.36 --> 5991.659
too much money you can never go to

5987.309 --> 5997.21
heaven no just means it makes it a lot

5991.659 --> 5998.7699999999995
harder anyway with that I'm gonna run

5997.21 --> 6001.71
