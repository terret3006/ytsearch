147.02 --> 156.62900000000002
yeah early on Daniel came in and then X

150.989 --> 160.59
320 Daniel started on talking about a

156.629 --> 163.5
supposed Sun video with the telescope

160.59 --> 166.44
using an age filter and yeah what the

163.5 --> 171.87
link that he didn't gave me just looked

166.44 --> 176.69
so CGI it just I can't believe I can't

171.87 --> 180.81
believe that [ __ ] anyway after them

176.69 --> 188.28
Amanda young came in drunken wallet for

180.81 --> 197.67000000000002
one one mister s flat-out faith Ober

188.28 --> 203.12
McCool James McCormick huh oh did he did

197.67 --> 203.11999999999998
he do Jason did was it what was it what

205.01 --> 214.13899999999998
made him ban you did you start saying

211.01 --> 217.019
disgusting things to people or were you

214.139 --> 219.09
caps spamming the concave stuff because

217.019 --> 226.85
that it's usually either one that'll do

219.09 --> 226.85
it okay

229.55 --> 242.99
oh right Q that's the dead chick right

235.6 --> 245.63
so maybe Jose did kind of like a if your

242.99 --> 249.64000000000001
to signal thing then by banning you for

245.63 --> 249.64
that it's kind of sad

256.7 --> 267.90999999999997
oh that's hilarious

261.47 --> 273.55
hey hello Fyodor Dostoevsky my favorite

267.91 --> 273.55
skeptic chat dweller

276.42 --> 280.5
because yeah this guy I don't know if

278.85 --> 283.38
you've been paying attention in the type

280.5 --> 288.17
of things he says but this guy is not

283.38 --> 290.88
just a troll he has some very complex

288.17 --> 294.39000000000004
ideas and things that he puts out and

290.88 --> 297.65
even criticism so this guy is smart it

294.39 --> 297.65
just has a terrible attitude

298.1 --> 306.89000000000004
no offense Fyodor mmm but thanks for

305.76 --> 310.01
popping by

306.89 --> 310.01
[Music]

319.479 --> 324.12899999999996
just I don't know it's just now I'm

322.12 --> 326.349
gonna go personally meddling again and

324.129 --> 329.62
please don't take offense but if you

326.349 --> 332.199
have all these smarts and you have all

329.62 --> 334.99
these needs that make you apply those

332.199 --> 340.3
smarts in a kind of a negative way I

334.99 --> 343.629
think you do try to give criticism but

340.3 --> 347.199
it just doesn't come out really right

343.629 --> 350.439
I really have to uphold a shield to see

347.199 --> 352.689
it so why don't you try to use your

350.439 --> 356.189
smarts to basically try to figure out

352.689 --> 358.749
yourself and see how you can get that

356.189 --> 362.319
negative tendency out of the way and

358.749 --> 364.629
somehow replace it by bypassing that

362.319 --> 367.719
energy feed into something more

364.629 --> 372.3
constructive that's what I've done with

367.719 --> 377.71
me because I used to be just like that

372.3 --> 379.93
probably worse and I said like I have my

377.71 --> 383.919
moments till a few days ago I said like

379.93 --> 386.649
yeah I feel like I'm gonna do just do

383.919 --> 388.899
the right thing but I feel like [ __ ] I

386.649 --> 391.36
feel like a [ __ ] I think like feel the

388.899 --> 393.58
whole world is a [ __ ] but that's okay

391.36 --> 396.629
because I'm a [ __ ] too and I think

393.58 --> 400.81
that is a kind of sensation that you're

396.629 --> 405.009
experiencing maybe so you can actually

400.81 --> 407.069
get out of that and suddenly switch your

405.009 --> 409.12
intelligence into something really

407.069 --> 413.08000000000004
constructive that is that'll actually

409.12 --> 417.729
uplift the intelligence of the people

413.08 --> 419.889
that surround you it rubs off if you

417.729 --> 423.18899999999996
apply it right that's what I'm trying to

419.889 --> 426.159
do so I highly recommend it trying it

423.189 --> 429.639
out just an attitude change and it's not

426.159 --> 430.889
negative it's not a I'm really trying to

429.639 --> 433.689
help out anyway

430.889 --> 438.669
I'd say take it for what it's worth I

433.689 --> 443.84900000000005
see mr. moon elvish tea now just green

438.669 --> 443.849
tea from Asia somewhere I think

445.06 --> 458.36
musicians for truth hello ute right so

455.15 --> 466.12899999999996
yeah I was basically right before this

458.36 --> 470.24
watching the sorry jaren ISM from

466.129 --> 472.61
yesterday from all the days I basically

470.24 --> 476.75
decided to go to bed early really like

472.61 --> 481.94
literally the second I was in my bed was

476.75 --> 483.979
when that show started it was such a it

481.94 --> 489.349
would have been such a great opportunity

483.979 --> 492.83
to be such a whiny little fanboy about

489.349 --> 495.56
Owen Benjamin in his chat now that's

492.83 --> 500.59
probably what of what have happened if I

495.56 --> 500.59
had stayed because I was very tired so

501.28 --> 510.31899999999996
no but I'm like really hoping somehow he

508.19 --> 512.45
would unban me I'd I think he probably

510.319 --> 515.779
won't do that because his band list is

512.45 --> 518.2090000000001
going to be so insanely vast it'll take

515.779 --> 524.57
an hour for him just to find it and he

518.209 --> 529.2199999999999
doesn't want to do that I get it but I

524.57 --> 531.38
really like I got over the oh my fan

529.22 --> 533.75
heartedness of him banning me because I

531.38 --> 534.29
do realize that yeah it's not that

533.75 --> 538.149
serious

534.29 --> 540.8
and he did shout me out after all so

538.149 --> 543.41
shouldn't be complaining that much I got

540.8 --> 546.38
to attention-grabbing I think what I

543.41 --> 549.98
really like is hang out still and just

546.38 --> 553.52
the energy and I do get bit jealous but

549.98 --> 557.57
only because I want that I want those

553.52 --> 560.87
things I want I can feel how he settled

557.57 --> 563.24
and how his energies have all basically

560.87 --> 565.76
been tamed by the things that he does

563.24 --> 569.29
all that gardening and taking care of it

565.76 --> 569.29
and I just I'm so jealous

570.67 --> 580.4
but I'm not gonna let it make me turn me

573.89 --> 581.6899999999999
negative so that's just can't I can't

580.4 --> 583.6
allow that to happen

581.69 --> 587.5400000000001
if that happens then I have to step away

583.6 --> 590.48
and I don't want to I did it for a very

587.54 --> 592.25
short time and then just got back

590.48 --> 597.22
because I know I can't leave this

592.25 --> 597.22
there's too much stuff here

604.3 --> 612.04
I may also I think yeah I've reacted

608.62 --> 614.26
like when I got Dan pretty silly saying

612.04 --> 618.9699999999999
and I said like oh and Benjamin is not

614.26 --> 621.84
that smart as he thinks I think I may

618.97 --> 625.0600000000001
have probably underestimated that

621.84 --> 628.09
because the more I study him yeah it

625.06 --> 631.5699999999999
shows that he has kind of the way that I

628.09 --> 638.6800000000001
do a fast direct insight he's on that

631.57 --> 639.75
level so I don't know it's so silly like

638.68 --> 645.0899999999999
we're the same age

639.75 --> 645.09
jaren I'm Benjamin and me all 39

658.04 --> 666.36
it will be good to hear to basically see

661.14 --> 669.09
like is there some way for me to to get

666.36 --> 674.07
closer like I'm said just saying it open

669.09 --> 677.0400000000001
now like I don't want to be sneaking up

674.07 --> 681.3900000000001
on them or trying to actor but like what

677.04 --> 684.18
is going on and what is it is there

681.39 --> 690.0
something about me that makes them

684.18 --> 695.7299999999999
hesitant to approach me what is that I'd

690.0 --> 698.52
like to know because yeah you should dad

695.73 --> 700.26
I don't get that much feedback in the

698.52 --> 703.529
sense that a lot of people in chat that

700.26 --> 707.49
are getting used to me don't see things

703.529 --> 711.93
wrong really unless it is and then but

707.49 --> 715.62
yeah with all the guys like Jaron well

711.93 --> 717.9599999999999
he is always nice to me but I never

715.62 --> 721.44
really get approached by him I never get

717.96 --> 729.27
like hey we got an idea for you or

721.44 --> 733.8800000000001
something or is there something about me

729.27 --> 735.75
that they just that they find

733.88 --> 738.21
unpredictable that they don't get that

735.75 --> 743.58
they're just keeping their distance or

738.21 --> 746.73
something because I am yeah for lack of

743.58 --> 750.24
better terms I'm open for business I'm

746.73 --> 753.3000000000001
ready to apply my skills to try things

750.24 --> 758.76
out just beyond just this show and

753.3 --> 762.54
getting on panels like I have been you

758.76 --> 765.78
know like in a way it's kind of getting

762.54 --> 768.54
old as well and that that was very plain

765.78 --> 770.0699999999999
that it was plenty clear yesterday on

768.54 --> 775.13
the debates when I just got sick of

770.07 --> 779.3900000000001
Brenda wait now there wasn't yesterday

775.13 --> 782.9
that was Friday no no it was yesterday

779.39 --> 782.9
it's Tuesday

784.82 --> 801.69
so I don't know I could probably use

792.96 --> 807.69
some advice so if any of you are

801.69 --> 809.5200000000001
listening if yeah if you got any info or

807.69 --> 813.089
anything just you know contact me on

809.52 --> 815.64
skype that's the easiest way like I'm

813.089 --> 820.1700000000001
not gonna be one of those guys that is

815.64 --> 825.8389999999999
constantly gonna spam you you know don't

820.17 --> 828.99
worry about that I know especially that

825.839 --> 830.7900000000001
yeah the bigger players as you I'm among

828.99 --> 832.649
Flyers they're just so busy they don't

830.79 --> 832.89
have time for that [ __ ] I totally get

832.649 --> 837.779
that

832.89 --> 842.52
so but I don't know maybe this is not

837.779 --> 844.47
how it really works maybe I'm the one

842.52 --> 847.65
that's supposed to be thinking of

844.47 --> 851.4300000000001
something that I could do and then draw

847.65 --> 856.05
ask another person into it I don't know

851.43 --> 858.2399999999999
I like pretty much everyone while the

856.05 --> 861.02
the Flat Earth early bird has been going

858.24 --> 864.1800000000001
since the beginning of this year

861.02 --> 865.8199999999999
everybody has kind of reformatted their

864.18 --> 870.9
show

865.82 --> 874.9100000000001
josè like several times even but I don't

870.9 --> 879.66
really I guess that the iswait switched

874.91 --> 881.6999999999999
technically but I rarely get people on

879.66 --> 886.38
the panel now I don't know what that is

881.7 --> 888.3290000000001
maybe it is because tend to overreact a

886.38 --> 892.65
little when somebody does come on maybe

888.329 --> 894.4799999999999
that it's like Oh finally somebody and

892.65 --> 901.91
then all that energy just starts pushing

894.48 --> 901.91
out maybe that's it it's the isolation

902.399 --> 907.829
yeah I don't know what it is

915.63 --> 926.49
what are you talking about mr. s okay so

923.63 --> 930.21
you'd like to help me but you're not a

926.49 --> 931.82
professional a buts yet you can say I'm

930.21 --> 935.36
not ready for it

931.82 --> 935.36
ready for what

948.05 --> 953.889
right yes Daniel I have that tendency

957.01 --> 966.34
and sometimes I misstep but I think that

961.45 --> 970.4200000000001
overall I pretty much get it correctly

966.34 --> 972.82
right away so much of what it said is

970.42 --> 986.2299999999999
just regurgitation anyway so I've heard

972.82 --> 988.3900000000001
it all oh my god mr. as please no I'm

986.23 --> 993.01
actually banning you for this that's

988.39 --> 997.86
just disgusting I'm asking for genuine

993.01 --> 1001.23
advice on how to basically approach

997.86 --> 1003.0
bigger players within Flat Earth and

1001.23 --> 1005.61
then you're telling me you know it's not

1003.0 --> 1009.89
gonna work because you're in Flat Earth

1005.61 --> 1012.89
Wells go screw yourself seriously

1009.89 --> 1012.89
banned

1020.22 --> 1025.8500000000001
[Music]

1022.029 --> 1028.91
and thank you others who are not flat

1025.85 --> 1030.8899999999999
earthers for not for behaving I really

1028.91 --> 1035.27
appreciate I have to emphasize that I

1030.89 --> 1038.39
know I don't ban people because they're

1035.27 --> 1041.9
ballers or because they think Flat Earth

1038.39 --> 1045.5790000000002
is crazy no I I banned them for

1041.9 --> 1047.5400000000002
misbehavior and that that there was

1045.579 --> 1065.6299999999999
misbehavior that was basically

1047.54 --> 1070.61
psychological abuse Tamera coffee I love

1065.63 --> 1079.3700000000001
it I really got the dosage right it does

1070.61 --> 1082.6399999999999
feel great it's really coffee plus and

1079.37 --> 1086.62
so simple just a little scoop so little

1082.64 --> 1086.6200000000001
and it's great I love it

1087.85 --> 1091.03

you know I am having this show every day

1097.59 --> 1107.3999999999999

1104.55 --> 1109.29
job I'm stuck at just doing the same

1107.4 --> 1113.22
damn thing every day and just

1109.29 --> 1115.05
desperately trying to figure out

1113.22 --> 1118.83
something new and that's it

1115.05 --> 1126.69
no way that I want to do some more

1118.83 --> 1129.51
things you know I do want to step up to

1139.25 --> 1149.55
new type of dynamic in a group on a show

1152.4 --> 1158.94
and then sometimes if I people all that

1156.0 --> 1162.93
and on the debates I'm kind of like eh

1158.94 --> 1165.9
yeah they fooling around kid or

1162.93 --> 1171.98
something and I just

1165.9 --> 1175.3500000000001
yeah unleash my inner teenager and just

1171.98 --> 1177.57
relieve myself of like the control

1175.35 --> 1181.77
responsibilities a little although I yet

1177.57 --> 1187.3799999999999
sometimes I do kind of pay attention as

1181.77 --> 1190.56
a beta for for Nathan because I like

1187.38 --> 1192.5400000000002
doing it I like keeping order it keeps

1190.56 --> 1194.7
people sharp too it's important and

1192.54 --> 1199.2
people have accepted that from me as a

1194.7 --> 1201.9
side function but I also want to kind of

1199.2 --> 1204.8600000000001
like see if I can get kind of a team

1201.9 --> 1204.8600000000001
thing going

1206.989 --> 1213.299
but that does take some practice and I

1210.959 --> 1221.669
do need to find the right people with

1213.299 --> 1224.209
the right chemistry for this and I kind

1221.669 --> 1227.459
of do need to get to know them maybe

1224.209 --> 1236.489
off-camera as well I don't know

1287.21 --> 1293.1200000000001
actual core foundation of the freaking

1290.69 --> 1293.8400000000001
flattered scene please tell me that's

1293.12 --> 1302.6899999999998
not true

1293.84 --> 1305.72
please it's just ridiculous to keep your

1302.69 --> 1307.8500000000001
fundamental platform and that's

1305.72 --> 1311.54
something that's called discord that's

1307.85 --> 1314.7199999999998
just that's just you almost made me say

1311.54 --> 1322.34

just wrong flat earth Dini campaigns huh

1322.34 --> 1325.84

1337.17 --> 1350.16
just no look if people aren't willing to

1346.47 --> 1360.14
basically get out of this card towards

1350.16 --> 1363.14
me that's just look how hard is it Skype

1360.14 --> 1363.14
YouTube

1372.75 --> 1379.92
that's just there's places that I won't

1376.23 --> 1382.77
go Facebook is one of them and that's an

1379.92 --> 1385.68
old thing and I knew from the first

1382.77 --> 1387.6299999999999
moment like this is big trouble I saw it

1385.68 --> 1390.75
in my visions very distinctly and it's

1387.63 --> 1402.45
happening it's worse than I even

1390.75 --> 1404.91
remember and this court no that's

1402.45 --> 1413.46
another one it's just it's a no-go for

1404.91 --> 1415.6200000000001
me and seriously the first time I tried

1413.46 --> 1419.28
my computer freaking crash now that's

1415.62 --> 1423.0
the sign you know that can't get clearer

1419.28 --> 1424.77
than that because I didn't want to go

1423.0 --> 1426.9
there in the first place and then my

1424.77 --> 1428.93
computer freakin crash that to reinstall

1426.9 --> 1428.93
it

1434.39 --> 1441.6200000000001
because of the name and because of what

1437.9 --> 1444.46
goes on there under that name Daniel

1441.62 --> 1444.4599999999998
that's why

1461.15 --> 1463.96
and uh

1466.67 --> 1477.23
that's that's creepy smash hit

1470.12 --> 1480.1
I I don't want to crash into the ocean

1477.23 --> 1480.1
thanks

1488.81 --> 1491.99
[Music]

1497.05 --> 1501.79
yeah enough advertisement about it

1512.63 --> 1515.3200000000002
Wow

1519.18 --> 1524.25
I don't want to go there it it's the

1521.58 --> 1527.01
same thing as Facebook it's the same

1524.25 --> 1530.04
that there may not be some weirdo at the

1527.01 --> 1532.3799999999999
top having all these delusions and

1530.04 --> 1536.309
trying to actively indoctrinate their

1532.38 --> 1539.3300000000002
public but what goes on there is still

1536.309 --> 1541.83
the same type of [ __ ] as what the people

1539.33 --> 1549.57
naturally already start to do on

1541.83 --> 1553.6999999999998
Facebook it's the same thing it's kind

1549.57 --> 1553.7
of also a little like Twitter I guess

1554.809 --> 1560.73
there's something about that format that

1557.55 --> 1565.8
yes unleashes things in people that's

1560.73 --> 1569.03
not healthy that's why I've never really

1565.8 --> 1569.03
done anything with Twitter either

1580.58 --> 1586.6699999999998
look I've been plenty warned about the

1584.33 --> 1590.0
dangers of social media and now I'm

1586.67 --> 1592.94
talking even Alex Jones in the early

1590.0 --> 1601.54
days in the first decade of this century

1592.94 --> 1601.54
so I just

1603.12 --> 1608.9699999999998
I felt weary of it I thought okay that's

1606.09 --> 1613.29
interesting and then immediately as soon

1608.97 --> 1616.43
as that was at least things started to

1613.29 --> 1619.26
pop up in the social awareness insane

1616.43 --> 1623.3100000000002
misbehaviors and people that totally

1619.26 --> 1627.18
freaked out like panic attack level from

1623.31 --> 1635.04
things that were just talked over it in

1627.18 --> 1638.01
chats you know it's like they used it as

1635.04 --> 1640.17
their secret dumping ground that's kind

1638.01 --> 1641.76
of like breaking up with text messages

1640.17 --> 1643.98
that's where it kind of started before

1641.76 --> 1646.83
social media and then certainly social

1643.98 --> 1651.06
media underwent that same thing and

1646.83 --> 1653.49
people that normally keep that in and

1651.06 --> 1655.56
then rarely find an opportunity to let

1653.49 --> 1657.78
it out and then whatever happens happens

1655.56 --> 1663.27
suddenly start throwing out all this

1657.78 --> 1665.22
[ __ ] and create havoc socially that's

1663.27 --> 1667.74
what started to happen and then the

1665.22 --> 1671.04
trolls started to arrive these side

1667.74 --> 1673.47
people that kind of thought wow this is

1671.04 --> 1676.37
a giant circus I'm gonna be that

1673.47 --> 1679.05
annoying spectator and just throw

1676.37 --> 1681.7399999999998
tomatoes and spit balls and [ __ ] and

1679.05 --> 1684.3899999999999
that's how that's that then happened

1681.74 --> 1686.82
that came out of that and I just

1684.39 --> 1688.92
immediately felt this is terrible being

1686.82 --> 1693.27
among these people is terrible because

1688.92 --> 1698.5500000000002
they're all open up unlocked demonic

1693.27 --> 1700.95
behavior and that lures it out in people

1698.55 --> 1703.1399999999999
that get close to it that entangle with

1700.95 --> 1706.38
it and that's the danger it breaks

1703.14 --> 1712.5900000000001
everyone open from their natural moral

1706.38 --> 1715.65
shielding socially and then this type of

1712.59 --> 1719.31
behavior started to concentrate itself

1715.65 --> 1720.6200000000001
in for example Facebook communities is

1719.31 --> 1723.24
one of the first things that really

1720.62 --> 1726.2399999999998
started to show this kind of freaky [ __ ]

1723.24 --> 1729.09
but then yeah pretty much every other

1726.24 --> 1731.34
platform that is kind of similar started

1729.09 --> 1733.1899999999998
to show the same things that's just

1731.34 --> 1736.03
where it's the most concentrated in

1733.19 --> 1740.47
facebook you got criminal [ __ ]

1736.03 --> 1743.26
literally in there it's just insane and

1740.47 --> 1745.54
it's also been discussed a lot in the

1743.26 --> 1747.49
media I think it like even in the

1745.54 --> 1749.6499999999999
Netherlands like what do we do about

1747.49 --> 1751.54
this is a freedom of speech versus yeah

1749.65 --> 1754.96
do something about the criminal acts

1751.54 --> 1756.97
does it actually influence other to do

1754.96 --> 1762.43
criminal and bla bla bla bla bla bla bla

1756.97 --> 1764.88
bla endless talking and there are more

1762.43 --> 1768.67
rules I guess in the Netherlands

1764.88 --> 1772.63
concerning Facebook than for example in

1768.67 --> 1775.5700000000002
the United States I think to be fair I

1772.63 --> 1779.3700000000001
haven't really kept all that much track

1775.57 --> 1783.48
because I never always kept my distance

1779.37 --> 1783.4799999999998
it's like it's their problem

1788.12 --> 1794.8999999999999
so I it's like this social media all

1791.84 --> 1797.4189999999999
these things the technology awesome it's

1794.9 --> 1799.52
an opportunity but unfortunately it's

1797.419 --> 1803.15
also been an opportunity and it's kind

1799.52 --> 1806.09
of been arranged by controllers to make

1803.15 --> 1810.44
it an opportunity alluring for people to

1806.09 --> 1811.82
throw out their [ __ ] and express the

1810.44 --> 1820.0700000000002
things that they're normally not allowed

1811.82 --> 1822.4089999999999
to and that has a firsthand effect where

1820.07 --> 1826.4289999999999
people are basically very satisfied

1822.409 --> 1829.5800000000002
there is a relief but it also starts to

1826.429 --> 1832.51
then pollute and echo on and sickening

1829.58 --> 1838.82
ideas start to like spread out and

1832.51 --> 1841.19
that's the backlash and that aggravates

1838.82 --> 1847.07
over time and now there's a political

1841.19 --> 1849.8200000000002
system even abusing that very affect so

1847.07 --> 1849.82
yeah

1856.2 --> 1863.999
no but look this communication

1860.58 --> 1866.609
technology is simply a means to an end

1863.999 --> 1871.679
technically and it is really good if you

1866.609 --> 1875.279
have like a private social platform for

1871.679 --> 1878.419
example that you use really for your own

1875.279 --> 1881.22
friends and you make this program very

1878.419 --> 1884.6290000000001
tinkered in a way that everyone gets

1881.22 --> 1887.249
exactly out of it what they want with

1884.629 --> 1890.1
like who can see them they could be

1887.249 --> 1893.279
hidden and all that that stuff that it's

1890.1 --> 1896.129
pure communication technology is just a

1893.279 --> 1898.909
very very very advanced phone system at

1896.129 --> 1904.35
at it basically and that's a very

1898.909 --> 1909.989
awesome way to apply it but just this

1904.35 --> 1914.629
weird open platforms it is kind of good

1909.989 --> 1917.809
but at the same time in the political

1914.629 --> 1923.34
situations that are going on the way

1917.809 --> 1928.139
people are being read about social norms

1923.34 --> 1932.369
and values in a very extreme way yeah

1928.139 --> 1936.33
the combination of that actually is yeah

1932.369 --> 1941.309
very negative but it's because of the

1936.33 --> 1944.82
combination if people were generally

1941.309 --> 1948.299
taught to just be good and modest and

1944.82 --> 1952.039
learn to critically think and be polite

1948.299 --> 1956.7
and be gentlemanly and all that and

1952.039 --> 1957.45
behave then those problems would not be

1956.7 --> 1959.22
that bad

1957.45 --> 1962.009
it would be rare there will be some

1959.22 --> 1965.779
trolls here and there but they would be

1962.009 --> 1970.859
kept in line pretty much by the majority

1965.779 --> 1973.44
so anyway social media it's never really

1970.859 --> 1975.749
been my thing but I do see the

1973.44 --> 1980.3300000000002
technological advantages of it and I

1975.749 --> 1980.33
have kind of also taken

1980.83 --> 1989.35
the liberty of using it for myself

1984.25 --> 1991.57
in my own way it allowed me to kind of

1989.35 --> 1996.8799999999999
have a internet social circle and a

1991.57 --> 2003.2
program without pretty much leaving a

1996.88 --> 2005.3700000000001
circle of 5 kilometers so yeah without

2003.2 --> 2008.16
social media and the Internet and the

2005.37 --> 2011.3899999999999
platform of YouTube oh yeah I wouldn't

2008.16 --> 2016.91
have the show with all these people so

2011.39 --> 2016.91
it's all about how you apply it

2024.06 --> 2027.1699999999998
[Music]

2030.62 --> 2033.58
you

2034.989 --> 2037.989
Thanks

2041.95 --> 2047.01
don't don't compare me to that guy thank

2044.83 --> 2047.01
you

2074.139 --> 2076.799
that

2082.059 --> 2088.36
Wow

2084.25 --> 2088.36
well good morning everyone

2089.78 --> 2094.55
it seems more and more like my chats

2092.03 --> 2097.2200000000003
becoming like the morning sparring

2094.55 --> 2104.03
ground for trolls waking up sometimes I

2097.22 --> 2108.0499999999997
get the feeling anyway yeah I hope you

2104.03 --> 2110.3500000000004
do appreciate me talking about the

2108.05 --> 2114.5
social media some of the history of it

2110.35 --> 2117.56
it is really good to keep to keep a wide

2114.5 --> 2121.34
open look as to how it developed what

2117.56 --> 2124.58
actually happened because we have our

2121.34 --> 2127.55
own personal memories of it and we may

2124.58 --> 2130.37
have seen some signals but those signals

2127.55 --> 2134.3300000000004
get snowed in by the constant change of

2130.37 --> 2137.27
everything and you don't see the

2134.33 --> 2138.5299999999997
distinguishing signs for what how they

2137.27 --> 2139.91
could have been seen

2138.53 --> 2141.5
you don't really it doesn't matter

2139.91 --> 2144.95
anymore because everything's changed

2141.5 --> 2148.94
anyway but it does matter because the

2144.95 --> 2151.46
pattern it's not going to be the only

2148.94 --> 2153.86
time such things are gonna happen the

2151.46 --> 2156.11
pattern is a pattern and it happens for

2153.86 --> 2158.48
a reason and you got to figure out what

2156.11 --> 2161.8900000000003
really happened how the signs came about

2158.48 --> 2165.05
and then how you can recognize that and

2161.89 --> 2170.35
even how you can then predict it and

2165.05 --> 2173.1800000000003
that is something that I love to do

2170.35 --> 2176.35
it's one of my ideas it's like okay you

2173.18 --> 2179.54
want to really really progress

2176.35 --> 2181.81
technology and stuff and applied to

2179.54 --> 2185.69
society and and all that for the better

2181.81 --> 2188.87
I'm the guy to help you I want to help

2185.69 --> 2192.35
think that out I have had so many

2188.87 --> 2197.48
freaking ideas it's just it's just

2192.35 --> 2201.17
instant planning I love it

2197.48 --> 2203.39
and I'd probably start out a bit little

2201.17 --> 2205.34
bit rough and then people would be like

2203.39 --> 2208.1
yeah you're oversimplifying it dude

2205.34 --> 2212.32
you're don't there's this and that and

2208.1 --> 2216.2999999999997
that and then so they'll be like ok

2212.32 --> 2218.5800000000004
right so even bigger

2216.3 --> 2221.4300000000003
and then other people may come along and

2218.58 --> 2222.66
say okay yeah that you almost got it but

2221.43 --> 2224.79
there are some things you have

2222.66 --> 2228.74
overlooked okay this is a really

2224.79 --> 2228.74
important to get that context and then

2229.28 --> 2236.34
I'll go as far as I need in that that

2234.45 --> 2239.43
sense I wouldn't mind end up being

2236.34 --> 2242.46
basically a words world societal planner

2239.43 --> 2249.9199999999996
if that is what that is

2242.46 --> 2252.84
I I just preferred not to be working for

2249.92 --> 2256.32
basically anti human Psychopaths when I

2252.84 --> 2260.73
get there if you know what I mean I

2256.32 --> 2264.8700000000003
don't want to be some Imperial wizard

2260.73 --> 2268.92
slave or something you know I prefer not

2264.87 --> 2275.91
to be like that that's a that's a

2268.92 --> 2281.88
nightmare scenario for me really but I

2275.91 --> 2286.41
do want to use this to see if I can

2281.88 --> 2292.35
really structurally help develop the

2286.41 --> 2294.2999999999997
efficiency and and manage also even side

2292.35 --> 2296.94
effects that a lot of people probably

2294.3 --> 2298.44
wouldn't predict and who knows there's

2296.94 --> 2301.2000000000003
there are probably people out there that

2298.44 --> 2303.63
are even better at it than me and then I

2301.2 --> 2306.99
hope to basically as I go get to know

2303.63 --> 2311.51
these people and learn what they learn

2306.99 --> 2314.79
and maybe even find out chronic problems

2311.51 --> 2316.8900000000003
because of their methodology approach

2314.79 --> 2321.24
just like what I did with quantum

2316.89 --> 2324.0
mechanics basically got back like okay

2321.24 --> 2328.1299999999997
this is what they're saying so what is

2324.0 --> 2330.87
the whole look at the whole picture

2328.13 --> 2334.7000000000003
through filters and then I figured out

2330.87 --> 2338.16
wait everything they do is based on

2334.7 --> 2340.35
presuppositions only of light being an

2338.16 --> 2342.33
indivisible particle traveling a speed

2340.35 --> 2344.43
and that is the entire base assumption

2342.33 --> 2347.88
that spawned the entirety of quantum

2344.43 --> 2350.66
mechanics now that I figured out

2347.88 --> 2354.4500000000003
basically by looking through it

2350.66 --> 2356.1299999999997
in the first glance like five minutes I

2354.45 --> 2358.8199999999997
got the first hints and then it took me

2356.13 --> 2362.4300000000003
a few days to word it out properly and

2358.82 --> 2366.27
then after week I'm now confident that

2362.43 --> 2368.2799999999997
I'm correct that I got it well I can do

2366.27 --> 2373.79
that with other things as well with

2368.28 --> 2384.23
complex structural problems societal

2373.79 --> 2384.23
loops I can do it done it in my visions

2385.91 --> 2388.91
so

2391.64 --> 2397.839
[Music]

2394.839 --> 2397.839
mmm

2401.97 --> 2412.68
I'm gonna enjoy this Apple anyway yeah I

2407.49 --> 2414.89
got aspirations in a designer sense and

2412.68 --> 2419.5789999999997
that is basically what I'm originally

2414.89 --> 2428.19
death artist is how I kind of like

2419.579 --> 2433.6800000000003
stamped it but it is designed I wanted

2428.19 --> 2435.809
to become an architect when I was

2433.68 --> 2437.8489999999997
younger and then yeah unfortunately I

2435.809 --> 2440.01
couldn't manage the level of schooling

2437.849 --> 2443.21
that was basically required for that I

2440.01 --> 2443.21
was too distracted

2446.06 --> 2449.219
[Music]

2452.81 --> 2455.929
[Music]

2457.8 --> 2467.23
now music for truth please don't troll

2464.56 --> 2481.66
bait Brenda about that I don't want to

2467.23 --> 2484.32
hear that [ __ ] for another second okay

2481.66 --> 2484.3199999999997
later Jose

2517.17 --> 2523.739
[Music]

2519.38 --> 2529.13
haha Thank You PJ for in some way

2523.739 --> 2534.719
actually attempting to seriously read me

2529.13 --> 2537.119
but yeah you are a little right I do

2534.719 --> 2544.44
almost feel like I'm being left out of

2537.119 --> 2546.6800000000003
the mix somehow I but it's not entirely

2544.44 --> 2546.68
true

2550.13 --> 2555.94
but there's there does seem to be

2552.349 --> 2560.3590000000004
something there and hey I'm used to that

2555.94 --> 2566.4500000000003
that's that's a kind of a problem I it's

2560.359 --> 2569.42
something about me that and the way I

2566.45 --> 2573.8289999999997
conduct myself I guess that no matter

2569.42 --> 2576.9790000000003
even if I do try to improve myself it

2573.829 --> 2581.299
still causes this effect so maybe it's

2576.979 --> 2584.479
just literally physically energetic like

2581.299 --> 2587.769
I somehow energetically repulse certain

2584.479 --> 2590.21
people certain class of people category

2587.769 --> 2594.529
maybe it's even chilly I don't know what

2590.21 --> 2597.609
that is it's really disappointing to be

2594.529 --> 2600.47
fair and I had some bad experiences

2597.609 --> 2608.299
because of that especially in my very

2600.47 --> 2611.749
young youth but it seems to be part of

2608.299 --> 2615.079
my fate that's kind of how I accepted it

2611.749 --> 2618.109
although who knows maybe maybe it could

2615.079 --> 2619.9100000000003
somehow be changed although I I don't

2618.109 --> 2625.15
know if I would be even be the same

2619.91 --> 2625.1499999999996
person I don't know what it is

2627.09 --> 2637.4700000000003
I wouldn't even really call it like

2636.03 --> 2643.38
feeling left out

2637.47 --> 2645.7999999999997
it's rather I'm just trying to invite

2643.38 --> 2649.9500000000003
people that might have some kind of

2645.8 --> 2654.42
obstacle somehow that's preventing them

2649.95 --> 2658.3999999999996
from contacting me and see if I can help

2654.42 --> 2658.4
them get that ups go out of the way

2664.55 --> 2667.51
that's all

2673.85 --> 2676.69
hmm

2676.74 --> 2690.0299999999997
rightful at our faith there's a lot of

2683.859 --> 2690.0299999999997
thingies I could do but

2691.58 --> 2697.61
I'm much more of an improvising verbal

2694.58 --> 2700.8199999999997
guy perhaps with a sort of a cue card or

2697.61 --> 2703.31
something a couple of words on it that's

2700.82 --> 2706.52
what I see that's what I kind of prefer

2703.31 --> 2710.0499999999997
to do that's why I'm just me talking

2706.52 --> 2713.87
every day it's all improvised all of it

2710.05 --> 2715.61
I'm not really a guy that's all that

2713.87 --> 2717.65
great and I don't really have to write

2715.61 --> 2723.4700000000003
software either nor do I have any money

2717.65 --> 2727.52
for that to really edit videos make like

2723.47 --> 2730.22
a little movie I tried it once it yeah

2727.52 --> 2732.89
the cat's pharisee video in it was kind

2730.22 --> 2735.0499999999997
of embarrassing really but hey it was

2732.89 --> 2737.92
just goofing around it was the first

2735.05 --> 2737.92
time I tried it

2744.21 --> 2749.58
yeah goodbye

2746.68 --> 2749.58
that is just

2751.26 --> 2761.5490000000004
um thanks now I got distracted damn you

2757.619 --> 2761.549
what the hell was this thing

2766.71 --> 2781.68
all right yeah flat-out faith beyond my

2773.07 --> 2785.6400000000003
Morning Show experiments sure if it is

2781.68 --> 2789.48
actually interesting I want the camera

2785.64 --> 2792.0299999999997
to get views that's a look I like views

2789.48 --> 2796.56
I have good eyes I really appreciate

2792.03 --> 2799.38
beauty edit visual beauty I can do a lot

2796.56 --> 2802.5
of things with that in art with an

2799.38 --> 2804.21
artistic touch to it perhaps not saying

2802.5 --> 2807.84
that I'm gonna add anything but just

2804.21 --> 2809.61
because of the way I shoot photos that's

2807.84 --> 2815.13
something I could do that's why I got

2809.61 --> 2822.32
the GoFundMe for my camera and other

2815.13 --> 2825.54
than that I don't know whatever

2822.32 --> 2831.4500000000003
interesting curiosity I bump in I love

2825.54 --> 2834.54
castles for example old buildings look

2831.45 --> 2836.91
there is so much I can do with the

2834.54 --> 2842.31
proper equipment and and finance a

2836.91 --> 2846.5
financial backup because doing things

2842.31 --> 2846.5
does Kozma does really cost money

2868.46 --> 2871.27
okay

2882.72 --> 2886.77
are you serious Trish

2893.78 --> 2901.369
if I didn't know who you are I'd

2897.08 --> 2903.47
probably ban you for that okay if I need

2901.369 --> 2911.48
money I need a job right yeah I tried

2903.47 --> 2913.97
that it's it's not that easy and also

2911.48 --> 2916.43
when you do that it kind of turns

2913.97 --> 2919.43
everything around no I'm not gonna ban

2916.43 --> 2922.7
you but it's really rude remark and it

2919.43 --> 2925.7599999999998
is you're basically saying what I do is

2922.7 --> 2927.68
not a job is this not a job is my

2925.76 --> 2930.369
participation in the flat earth scene

2927.68 --> 2935.81
and having scientific discussions and

2930.369 --> 2938.06
development and ideas helping educate is

2935.81 --> 2940.81
that not a job I know it doesn't pay a

2938.06 --> 2943.82
lot is it not a job

2940.81 --> 2946.07
yeah lone hyena he did offer me a job

2943.82 --> 2949.4300000000003
but I don't want to associate with that

2946.07 --> 2959.3
guy ever because he is evil he's a very

2949.43 --> 2963.83
sick lying creepy individual I'd never

2959.3 --> 2967.54
take a drink from him if it wasn't just

2963.83 --> 2967.54
an open bottle ever

2977.02 --> 2983.95
now Costa Emanuele alloted whatever no

2980.74 --> 2993.1189999999997
it's it's not a hobby it's not really

2983.95 --> 2998.85
just a hobby I do see this as well as

2993.119 --> 3001.4100000000003
trying to build something bigger and

2998.85 --> 3006.06
eventually I will have to do something

3001.41 --> 3008.1299999999997
more I want to get into wider audiences

3006.06 --> 3010.89
basically but not I don't want it to

3008.13 --> 3012.75
just boom boom oh now I got 10,000

3010.89 --> 3016.74
subscribers and I'm so important no I

3012.75 --> 3020.79
actually want to want for them to be

3016.74 --> 3023.79
real people that do resonate I want them

3020.79 --> 3028.11
to find me I want to build something

3023.79 --> 3031.17
here and I want this to be the way that

3028.11 --> 3035.57
I get by at least until I get the whole

3031.17 --> 3038.25
GTI thing in its final stage and then

3035.57 --> 3042.06
yeah this will basically be a hobby that

3038.25 --> 3044.52
potentially will yield even money even

3042.06 --> 3046.56
though yeah I might even stop asking for

3044.52 --> 3049.44
it at that point because I really don't

3046.56 --> 3053.21
actually need it anymore but if people

3049.44 --> 3053.21
give it to me I want what am I gonna do

3055.15 --> 3061.42
but then it'll be a hobby but right now

3058.539 --> 3065.759
I am really doing this professionally

3061.42 --> 3068.46
my attitude I'm trying to be as yeah

3065.759 --> 3072.309
improving my professional attitude and

3068.46 --> 3074.71
not breaking with principles it's yeah I

3072.309 --> 3077.3190000000004
approach it religiously at it through

3074.71 --> 3079.66
the past of path of Christ but at the

3077.319 --> 3082.39
same time that could also be said yeah

3079.66 --> 3084.8489999999997
it's a code of conduct and it

3082.39 --> 3094.029
synchronizes with how I like to be

3084.849 --> 3096.4300000000003
professional and considering that I

3094.029 --> 3098.7
should definitely get most of the swear

3096.43 --> 3103.21
words out the way eventually

3098.7 --> 3106.509
although yeah as a as a show as a person

3103.21 --> 3109.42
here showing their own thing I'm

3106.509 --> 3112.779
basically I have to stop saying

3109.42 --> 3114.819
basically it's terrible it's like a

3112.779 --> 3116.349
blind spot keeps on coming back I don't

3114.819 --> 3121.799
like it when other people do it I

3116.349 --> 3121.799
shouldn't so let's not say that again

3121.89 --> 3131.0389999999998
but I will swear at times when it's when

3126.46 --> 3131.039
I'm passionate or when I feel it's right

3131.4 --> 3140.19
and technically that's not professional

3135.599 --> 3143.94
but the show I think I feel I judge as

3140.19 --> 3143.94
requires it sometimes

3146.819 --> 3152.209
yeah a lot of people say it and some

3149.429 --> 3160.009
people say it's so nauseatingly much

3152.209 --> 3160.009
that it can really hurt it's a tic

3163.279 --> 3171.779
it's very predominant especially in

3167.219 --> 3175.559
America thank you for the superjet

3171.779 --> 3176.489
donation superjet donation $2 from

3188.239 --> 3192.109
it's just about time

3210.6 --> 3215.3399999999997
sometimes it seems like people in my

3213.18 --> 3220.56
chat just are having a whole nother

3215.34 --> 3222.8900000000003
hangout kind of seems like an

3220.56 --> 3225.32
interesting discussion at times but oh

3222.89 --> 3229.89
hey yeah thanks again

3225.32 --> 3233.6600000000003
Trish Blythe let's keep sorry

3250.95 --> 3263.3999999999996
thanks I think this this month I might

3258.06 --> 3266.34
be getting well a record monthly output

3263.4 --> 3269.94
I got a lot of super chests this month's

3266.34 --> 3272.19
pretty surprising so thanks everyone oh

3269.94 --> 3275.09
yeah it's an unusual amount of support

3272.19 --> 3280.88
compared to the months before maybe

3275.09 --> 3280.88
maybe I have improved maybe people do

3280.91 --> 3286.98
yeah do feel like I'm doing better and

3284.22 --> 3289.4399999999996
think that's okay I hope they do I hope

3286.98 --> 3293.22
I am going somewhere I feel that I'm

3289.44 --> 3295.86
going somewhere I just have to be

3293.22 --> 3300.2099999999996
patient a little longer patience has

3295.86 --> 3303.81
never been my greatest strength so since

3300.21 --> 3310.62
I can't really tame it I'll just have to

3303.81 --> 3313.58
contain it hmm okay Jason mcCormick well

3310.62 --> 3316.5899999999997
if you with capital letters can't wait

3313.58 --> 3321.06
until I get my camera well you can make

3316.59 --> 3324.09
it happen of course by donating to my

3321.06 --> 3326.21
GoFundMe it's in the description box

3324.09 --> 3326.21
below

3332.93 --> 3338.04
anyway I am gonna run out of plow okay

3336.57 --> 3342.21
thanks again

3338.04 --> 3344.2799999999997
truthfully Trish Blythe for the $5.99

3342.21 --> 3350.19
Australian dollar super jetta nation

3344.28 --> 3354.42
seek God seek God indeed or seek God

3350.19 --> 3356.2200000000003
recognize God and from within the

3354.42 --> 3360.359
darkness if you feel the darkness is

3356.22 --> 3365.91
trying to noise out the light then call

3360.359 --> 3368.52
upon but seeking God it's more like

3365.91 --> 3371.93
recognizing because where would you have

3368.52 --> 3373.08
to seek God if God is all things

3371.93 --> 3376.2
basically

3373.08 --> 3380.0989999999997
but anyway it's little detail thanks so
