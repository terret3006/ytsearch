mmm I got turmeric coffee here and tea

147.049 --> 152.209
that's it haven't had breakfast yet for

149.51 --> 155.12
some reason you know I anyway the

152.209 --> 159.28
weather today is it makes a bag it's

155.12 --> 163.4
it's kind of beautiful some it was

159.28 --> 166.579
pouring rain this morning very like a

163.4 --> 169.9
big storm all of a sudden and but yeah

166.579 --> 173.15
there's nothing left from that and

169.9 --> 174.58
there's some chemtrails I think doesn't

173.15 --> 177.68
look like that

174.58 --> 184.22000000000003
but not active at the moment that I can

177.68 --> 191.08
spot right yeah and the autumn colors

184.22 --> 191.08
are getting very apparent see

192.34 --> 204.76
anyway kind of nice and yeah not as cold

201.7 --> 207.39999999999998
as it has been like yesterday for it's

204.76 --> 218.85999999999999
probably due to the storm and all the

207.4 --> 222.37
extra moisture that brought so let's see

218.86 --> 225.31
who is in jet for waiting so long secret

222.37 --> 231.81900000000002
Asian man was first stone monkey 3d

225.31 --> 240.18
Amanda young hm Steve Irenaeus Turla

231.819 --> 244.78
stylist area good servant thank see you

240.18 --> 249.549
aka the independent variable the miss

244.78 --> 252.819
Kang yeah good to see you all yeah it's

249.549 --> 255.31
bit of a bit of a quiet morning so far

252.819 --> 259.59999999999997
but I don't know yesterday was just all

255.31 --> 262.27
the activity everywhere and I think

259.6 --> 264.85
things are now cooling down a bit from

262.27 --> 270.729
all that but it must have been partied

264.85 --> 272.77000000000004
out yesterday and evening but yeah me

270.729 --> 275.039
not so much I didn't go to bed that

272.77 --> 275.039
light

279.449 --> 292.36
and just so many video so many streams

282.52 --> 301.71
so many things oh god there's the Diablo

292.36 --> 301.71000000000004
for now what oh dear

310.23 --> 313.07
okay

318.05 --> 320.08
Oh

320.63 --> 328.37
that looks interesting so it's basically

324.08 --> 332.41999999999996
Diablo 3 but except they they added some

328.37 --> 335.21
other environmental interaction

332.42 --> 337.54
mechanics that's good that's really what

335.21 --> 340.25
it missed a lot but that's such things

337.54 --> 343.40000000000003
difficult so anyway yeah from a gamer

340.25 --> 348.2
perspective it looks interesting afraid

343.4 --> 357.85999999999996
I probably be ending up getting into

348.2 --> 360.26
that but yeah thanks for the heads up

357.86 --> 364.87
what else did you put it in there not

360.26 --> 364.87
that just that IPs

370.389 --> 377.219
are you talking about what IPS come into

373.78 --> 377.219
chat or into

389.669 --> 393.51
okay Fyodor Dostoevsky

400.889 --> 403.61
yeah

415.84 --> 419.65
[Music]

423.53 --> 428.45
yeah yeah Owen Benjamin I wasn't I

426.26 --> 432.05
almost forgot yeah I wouldn't I caught

428.45 --> 436.34
Owen Benjamin yesterday life which was

432.05 --> 439.01
really cool and inserted plenty of

436.34 --> 440.65999999999997
comments he would read one out yay

439.01 --> 443.09
but I don't know which one that is

440.66 --> 445.85
because he today he posted two videos

443.09 --> 449.44
and I'm watching one right now there's

445.85 --> 452.09000000000003
another one after so it could be that I

449.44 --> 454.55
was present at the one that I haven't

452.09 --> 457.06
watched yet it's really good stuff as

454.55 --> 457.06
usual

468.76 --> 477.36
all right okay oh yeah another weird

472.63 --> 481.89
little oddity yeah feet hurt herself he

477.36 --> 484.03000000000003
wouldn't recommend it but it's your life

481.89 --> 487.8
yeah there was another weird little

484.03 --> 491.34999999999997
thing what could just be more trolling

487.8 --> 494.5
the aaron armstrong the guy that just

491.35 --> 496.69
saw this agitation between well he just

494.5 --> 498.81
declared that he's a flat earther now i

496.69 --> 498.81
think

503.87 --> 509.11
but he could just be trolling I don't

506.99 --> 509.11
know

517.06 --> 525.0999999999999
oh yeah Adam ikan is on the on the globe

520.63 --> 527.92
light tour so saw him on that livestream

525.1 --> 531.16
yet yeah it was all so many live streams

527.92 --> 537.0999999999999
and video is in every globe like tour

531.16 --> 539.65
and the Flat Earth debates and let me

537.1 --> 542.73
see if I can even find it all back in

539.65 --> 542.73
the YouTube history

553.82 --> 556.6600000000001
it's all this

557.83 --> 562.57
it's a bit weird to me because people

560.709 --> 565.5999999999999
like Owen Benjamin but others they

562.57 --> 569.6800000000001
constantly bring forward figures that

565.6 --> 573.37
are apparently of interest somehow Ben

569.68 --> 575.5889999999999
Shapiro and Nick Fuentes

573.37 --> 579.49
yeah and Owen Benjamin jokes a lot about

575.589 --> 582.9100000000001
it but I've I've never really picked up

579.49 --> 586.36
on any of those but now even lifting the

582.91 --> 590.3199999999999
veil is it's doing a video about that it

586.36 --> 593.29
I don't know it's it these people seem

590.32 --> 601.089
to just be very narrative driven in a

593.29 --> 604.209
way so yeah I'm not I'm not the one to

601.089 --> 607.5100000000001
really go and watch those videos oh yeah

604.209 --> 610.54
one little funny detail too and I I

607.51 --> 612.88
mentioned like the Obama thing yesterday

610.54 --> 615.31
that he said like yeah you can't get

612.88 --> 618.9399999999999
stuck on it on the words concept you

615.31 --> 621.279
gotta go get to some action then well I

618.94 --> 624.1300000000001
got a lot of criticism from his side

621.279 --> 631.41
about that like how dare you it's so

624.13 --> 631.41
typical I thought that was kind of funny

636.05 --> 640.55
um right Flat Earth

651.93 --> 661.9799999999999
hmm oh yeah geo shifters Halloween

654.27 --> 665.81
special was really funny that's two

661.98 --> 665.8100000000001
crazy things NASA puts out

670.68 --> 678.1189999999999
oh yeah Martin littke as well I had a

675.24 --> 680.009
new video I wasn't there life I watched

678.119 --> 684.24
it very early this morning to some just

680.009 --> 688.439
weird stuff and there gave me all these

684.24 --> 690.48
kinds of crazy ideas about what they

688.439 --> 693.059
could have been doing there with all the

690.48 --> 695.5790000000001
bones and [ __ ] and all this electric

693.059 --> 698.99
this is apparent electrical activity

695.579 --> 702.179
it's it really creeped me out in a way

698.99 --> 704.49
but it is really fascinating just makes

702.179 --> 710.55
me think that it might be something

704.49 --> 712.8290000000001
about that culture and even makes me

710.55 --> 714.99
wonder about like the whole French

712.829 --> 719.1289999999999
Revolution which was supposedly so

714.99 --> 722.129
bloody you know there was a lot of

719.129 --> 726.889
carnage going on so I just wondered is

722.129 --> 726.889
that something that they kind of did

727.129 --> 735.839
sounds really macabre and dark I just

731.16 --> 739.709
wonder if they like like use some kind

735.839 --> 742.86
of necromancy in this Electrical thing I

739.709 --> 746.429
don't know my imagination just really

742.86 --> 748.769
started to ride with that but it goes

746.429 --> 753.72
very much into the direction of typical

748.769 --> 758.069
game type scenarios just seemed almost

753.72 --> 759.929
like undead technology to me or just the

758.069 --> 764.1289999999999
whole thing with the bones and just

759.929 --> 766.279
creeped me out really I don't really

764.129 --> 768.6
want to think about it too much so

766.279 --> 772.98
that's what you get when you watch

768.6 --> 775.47
martin ithaca not necessarily even the

772.98 --> 779.24
things that he says but just the the

775.47 --> 779.24
pictures themselves just

798.27 --> 806.8199999999999
yes time flies like Nero fruit flies

803.13 --> 809.66
like a banana that's that's actually

806.82 --> 809.6600000000001
clever feet are

828.54 --> 832.559
right where is everyone

844.01 --> 857.18
not used to this little amount of

847.01 --> 859.49
activity in my chats a you know current

857.18 --> 864.26
laser eyes you know you know see what I

859.49 --> 869.62
posted Oh God right stupid like a

864.26 --> 869.62
WikiLeaks document supposedly revealed

869.86 --> 876.95
the US base on the moon and how it was

873.89 --> 880.58
supposedly destroyed by the Soviet Union

876.95 --> 883.07
you can't get more silly than this it's

880.58 --> 885.6800000000001
just it's kind of a bummer that

883.07 --> 892.4300000000001
WikiLeaks would be involved in that kind

885.68 --> 896.4499999999999
of thing it was so silly anyway

892.43 --> 897.9399999999999
it it's every yeah it's a bunch of guys

896.45 --> 901.0400000000001
talking

897.94 --> 907.0100000000001
it seems really silly but anyway yet

901.04 --> 908.9599999999999
this exists now apparently and that

907.01 --> 911.06
channel is not the first time that I

908.96 --> 918.74
bumped into that it's been around for a

911.06 --> 920.5999999999999
while okay the independent variable no

918.74 --> 924.89
there's not really a structure to the

920.6 --> 928.4
show except for my typical intro

924.89 --> 931.0699999999999
routines and the outro what I do know

928.4 --> 933.41
there's not a lot of reasons and not a

931.07 --> 935.6600000000001
lot of structure here it's a lot of

933.41 --> 937.6999999999999
improvisation and hey if somebody wants

935.66 --> 941.18
to be a guest or forward some kind of

937.7 --> 944.23
subject or hey ask a good question then

941.18 --> 947.75
you can get me going that's how it works

944.23 --> 950.84
or if I'm just full of a subject myself

947.75 --> 953.44
I'll just keep on going myself despite

950.84 --> 953.44
the jet

954.48 --> 963.379
ooh yeah yeah good point

960.089 --> 966.7790000000001
Capra so no I haven't tested it out yet

963.379 --> 972.869
it was a good tip from from Tony

966.779 --> 976.97
yesterday hello da studio 68

972.869 --> 976.97
I thought he says

981.48 --> 985.26
let's see anyone else

996.38 --> 1001.63
yeah yesterday's debates was also very

999.47 --> 1007.57
interesting with it it went on pretty

1001.63 --> 1008.13
long and it was funny because what's his

1007.57 --> 1013.5100000000001
name again

1008.13 --> 1016.06
none he's always trying to poke at QE

1013.51 --> 1018.81
and quantum mechanics and all that and

1016.06 --> 1022.78
he really tried to point at something

1018.81 --> 1028.2
about the assumptions of what individual

1022.78 --> 1031.06
gas molecules do and are and basically

1028.2 --> 1035.38
to me I consider that a legitimate

1031.06 --> 1038.2
inquiry but he seemed to be so he rather

1035.38 --> 1040.9
fatalistic in his approach or like just

1038.2 --> 1043.5
just to break it all apart that was his

1040.9 --> 1046.92
approach instead of actually trying to

1043.5 --> 1052.96
refine and redefine what's going on

1046.92 --> 1055.6000000000001
based on data but yeah I thought it was

1052.96 --> 1057.28
pretty good at conversation so flat

1055.6 --> 1060.34
earth debates I think wasn't an after

1057.28 --> 1064.59
show do check it out yeah I don't know

1060.34 --> 1070.27
if Nathan already premiere at that one

1064.59 --> 1072.31
check YouTube that happened yeah it's

1070.27 --> 1075.16
not the ridiculous rumpus reference

1072.31 --> 1079.51
frames and Coriolis effect attack

1075.16 --> 1086.13
because that was from a while ago so no

1079.51 --> 1086.1299999999999
I don't think that he premiered it yet

1090.25 --> 1096.87
ya know noloty says

1099.559 --> 1107.2
yeah yeah you gotta split it apart okay

1103.61 --> 1109.879
like everyone that really hates John and

1107.2 --> 1113.6290000000001
it's not getting dissuade at anytime

1109.879 --> 1120.019
soon about that you gotta break it apart

1113.629 --> 1122.029
you gotta recognize yes on average you

1120.019 --> 1125.33
could definitely consider him kind of

1122.029 --> 1128.059
like a dick in a very specific way and

1125.33 --> 1131.019
he is not taller and he's not flexible

1128.059 --> 1136.1
and he can definitely be disruptive for

1131.019 --> 1138.499
a no real good reason like for on the

1136.1 --> 1141.1589999999999
long run it's just it's very temperate

1138.499 --> 1143.21
temperamental but that doesn't mean

1141.159 --> 1145.7
automatically that he's wrong if you're

1143.21 --> 1150.559
gonna put that with that then I'm gonna

1145.7 --> 1154.97
stop you because QE is not wrong he's

1150.559 --> 1158.509
not perfect but on average he is very

1154.97 --> 1161.57
correct about most things if he gets to

1158.509 --> 1169.779
that point if you can bypass all the

1161.57 --> 1169.779
social stuff so it's very simple

1174.76 --> 1183.44
no no I don't I don't I don't justify

1180.62 --> 1185.51
his behavior I point at it look I do the

1183.44 --> 1193.67
same thing to everyone Lonnie I do it to

1185.51 --> 1195.65
you I do it to grumpus I try to take

1193.67 --> 1199.19
everyone as they are and just try to

1195.65 --> 1203.1100000000001
learn to deal with how they are and try

1199.19 --> 1207.55
to basically get as much effective

1203.11 --> 1207.55
results out of the whole thing as I can

1208.45 --> 1214.79
but that has no direct relation to

1211.91 --> 1223.7900000000002
whether they are on average wrong or

1214.79 --> 1226.55
right about things that they assert look

1223.79 --> 1229.07
Lottie I'm not gonna be like a freaking

1226.55 --> 1232.01
social justice warrior virtue sickening

1229.07 --> 1237.34
for a bunch of Baal tarts like oh yeah

1232.01 --> 1241.1
Jonas if you dig now you just like duh

1237.34 --> 1243.4399999999998
the situation is self-explanatory it

1241.1 --> 1247.04
really is and whining about it

1243.44 --> 1251.0900000000001
especially from from my angle is just

1247.04 --> 1258.08
completely useless trust me I tried

1251.09 --> 1264.6499999999999
there's no response from that you got to

1258.08 --> 1267.3999999999999
work with what what is that the really

1264.65 --> 1267.4
is level

1279.36 --> 1282.02
what

1282.45 --> 1288.8400000000001
Hey hello hacker dwells long time no see

1285.149 --> 1291.7389999999998
what Taylor weird it's just disgusting

1288.84 --> 1291.7389999999998
mark dinner

1296.95 --> 1304.059
it's really disgusting

1300.97 --> 1304.059
[Music]

1311.07 --> 1324.78
right kamikaze Gilmore alright QE is

1320.31 --> 1326.31
just a bit of a rough player that's just

1324.78 --> 1330.3
the way he does things

1326.31 --> 1334.77
that's what how he likes it that's

1330.3 --> 1337.29
probably what helps him put all the

1334.77 --> 1339.41
energies inside of him in a better

1337.29 --> 1341.67
alignment for him to function properly

1339.41 --> 1346.71
utilize them instead of getting

1341.67 --> 1349.2
disrupted by it cuz Kyoya is very smart

1346.71 --> 1354.02
it has a lot of energy but look being

1349.2 --> 1356.67
very smart is problematic for everyone

1354.02 --> 1361.17
you don't really get it unless you have

1356.67 --> 1363.75
it it's it brings problems usually tends

1361.17 --> 1367.22
to bring social issues that are very

1363.75 --> 1370.74
tough to understand for outsiders

1367.22 --> 1373.89
because they it's like what why doesn't

1370.74 --> 1377.67
he just stop that and they don't

1373.89 --> 1382.8300000000002
understand why it is like that it's like

1377.67 --> 1386.79
that you got to understand what puts

1382.83 --> 1389.1799999999998
people in the their set behaviors as

1386.79 --> 1389.18
they do

1394.6 --> 1397.6
anyway

1407.69 --> 1411.97
I don't let earth or its rhetoric

1412.72 --> 1421.24
well it's because of the approach it's

1417.85 --> 1424.1799999999998
the angle to the approach and with

1421.24 --> 1426.88
Nathan's shows that's how the Flat Earth

1424.18 --> 1431.38
debate started once he got a grip he's

1426.88 --> 1435.1000000000001
playing the top dog and he is claiming

1431.38 --> 1439.72
dominant he's basically claiming King

1435.1 --> 1442.1799999999998
Kingdom effectively and he has the tools

1439.72 --> 1444.96
to do it he has the the correctness he

1442.18 --> 1448.3600000000001
has the details he has the arguments and

1444.96 --> 1452.2
thus it's very tough to overthrow that

1448.36 --> 1455.2299999999998
but ballers can't utilize that it's

1452.2 --> 1458.68
absolutely impossible because they don't

1455.23 --> 1461.92
have the tools to maintain king hood so

1458.68 --> 1465.73
the only way they can try to emulate it

1461.92 --> 1469.92
is by bluffing at all and that will make

1465.73 --> 1475.81
them very patronizing to almost everyone

1469.92 --> 1479.6100000000001
but not for good reason only for for the

1475.81 --> 1481.98
illusion just maintain the image of that

1479.61 --> 1484.8999999999999
something like that is going on not

1481.98 --> 1490.21
founded in real arguments and in real

1484.9 --> 1492.67
tools that's the big difference it's

1490.21 --> 1494.1100000000001
much more annoying and it's a complete

1492.67 --> 1497.91
waste of time look when you go to

1494.11 --> 1500.59
Nathan's and you get hammered with

1497.91 --> 1503.14
arguments or whatever and depending on

1500.59 --> 1504.1299999999999
how much you get triggered or how well

1503.14 --> 1507.42
you're gonna listen

1504.13 --> 1510.97
you can absolutely learn a lot of things

1507.42 --> 1515.52
like effectively learn them in the

1510.97 --> 1518.29
moment as you are on the debate show but

1515.52 --> 1519.82
yeah that's not gonna happen with fight

1518.29 --> 1525.07
the flatter at the rich rhetoric because

1519.82 --> 1527.23
they don't do that you there's nothing

1525.07 --> 1530.9099999999999
to let the only thing you can learn is

1527.23 --> 1534.7
how it is supposed to be in their

1530.91 --> 1538.15
effective collective religion and it

1534.7 --> 1540.3700000000001
doesn't really bring footing it doesn't

1538.15 --> 1542.2
really bring concrete results it just

1540.37 --> 1547.5
tells you how the story is supposed to

1542.2 --> 1547.5
be and get in mind that's it

1555.18 --> 1561.27
I'm from the Netherlands I got questions

1558.01 --> 1561.27
dottie yes

1572.7 --> 1578.6200000000001
what does Nathan do the same it's this

1576.37 --> 1583.1499999999999
response to what your guys are talking

1578.62 --> 1586.6
about or what I'm talking about Nathan

1583.15 --> 1589.18
does this know Nathan doesn't do the

1586.6 --> 1592.75
same but he does run out of patience

1589.18 --> 1596.5900000000001
sometimes because the thing about globus

1592.75 --> 1600.87
is if you actually break their arguments

1596.59 --> 1604.1499999999999
they'll still keep on going because

1600.87 --> 1606.1
they're used to that so they just tried

1604.15 --> 1608.17
to bypass the thing that breaks the

1606.1 --> 1611.08
whole thing to keep on painting the rest

1608.17 --> 1614.77
of the gesso story and it gets really

1611.08 --> 1617.1399999999999
tiresome sometimes you know sometimes

1614.77 --> 1619.2
it's amusing just as a psychological

1617.14 --> 1621.7900000000002
experience just like let them go and

1619.2 --> 1623.5
then hammer it all down after a while

1621.79 --> 1625.54
you could take a very long time you

1623.5 --> 1627.34
could let them ramble for 50 minutes

1625.54 --> 1631.1499999999999
like feeling that they've totally won

1627.34 --> 1635.1899999999998
and then just basically mute them and

1631.15 --> 1638.74
take apart every single thing they said

1635.19 --> 1641.01
mercilessly every detail and then take

1638.74 --> 1645.07
it all the way again you could do that

1641.01 --> 1648.43
or you can be impatient and just say no

1645.07 --> 1650.2
you're not responding to me breaking the

1648.43 --> 1652.1200000000001
actual argument you're just trying to

1650.2 --> 1655.54
bypass it now

1652.12 --> 1658.4199999999998
you're gonna shut up and say yes I

1655.54 --> 1661.48
understand my argument is wrong that is

1658.42 --> 1666.5800000000002
what Nathan does and it's his choice he

1661.48 --> 1669.16
does it because he's impatient because

1666.58 --> 1672.9299999999998
there's no response to the actual

1669.16 --> 1672.93
victory within the arguments

1679.49 --> 1686.19
but yet the bullying oh the bullying new

1683.16 --> 1688.41
pony yet the bullying right what you

1686.19 --> 1693.42
perceive is bullying that's what happens

1688.41 --> 1695.3700000000001
when people lose and then pretend like

1693.42 --> 1697.53
they're winning and then they're

1695.37 --> 1700.1399999999999
struggling around what you do is you amp

1697.53 --> 1703.56
up the pressure to expose the lie that

1700.14 --> 1705.3600000000001
they refuse to let go of and you could

1703.56 --> 1710.34
perceive that as bullying but they're

1705.36 --> 1715.2299999999998
there by their own volition actual

1710.34 --> 1717.6899999999998
bullies they go to people and then

1715.23 --> 1720.78
bother them and then those people can't

1717.69 --> 1722.81
get away that's that's more like real

1720.78 --> 1730.5
bullying that's not what Nathan does

1722.81 --> 1733.05
people go to him you know it in a

1730.5 --> 1736.8
similar way you could have say about

1733.05 --> 1738.1499999999999
fight to Flat Earth and all that yeah

1736.8 --> 1739.9199999999998
you could say oh but they're bullies

1738.15 --> 1743.22
because when you go there yeah they're

1739.92 --> 1746.22
done talking to you is like yeah guess

1743.22 --> 1749.04
what that's why I don't go there because

1746.22 --> 1751.32
I don't want to end up wasting my time

1749.04 --> 1753.6
over there and then ending up oh they're

1751.32 --> 1758.51
bullying me there because it makes me

1753.6 --> 1763.98
look [ __ ] and it's no use to do that

1758.51 --> 1766.97
if you've got a problem then fix it or

1763.98 --> 1766.97
move on

1770.07 --> 1773.859
[Music]

1774.759 --> 1782.69
it's very simple if I see it like this I

1779.869 --> 1788.029
have a certain range of skills talents

1782.69 --> 1790.6390000000001
insights and goodwill and those

1788.029 --> 1794.119
abilities are available under specific

1790.639 --> 1796.82
conditions so I will go to channels I

1794.119 --> 1799.039
also say things in chat I may go on the

1796.82 --> 1802.85
panel and it all depends on how I am

1799.039 --> 1804.95
welcomed even if they are Globus you

1802.85 --> 1807.109
know I had a I had pretty good times are

1804.95 --> 1810.799
over at Jose's before he went all

1807.109 --> 1813.71
suddenly hostile like in the last month

1810.799 --> 1815.57
and even though being surrounded by

1813.71 --> 1818.0900000000001
Globus I put down some interesting

1815.57 --> 1820.4289999999999
things but my skills were effectively

1818.09 --> 1825.1689999999999
utilized though even within the

1820.429 --> 1827.179
presuppositions and all that so my

1825.169 --> 1830.269
skills are available but yet I'm not

1827.179 --> 1833.0590000000002
just gonna give them away I'm not just

1830.269 --> 1836.359
gonna let myself be enslaved in the face

1833.059 --> 1838.489
of misbehavior towards me so if Jose is

1836.359 --> 1839.899
then gonna be a total dick yeah then I'm

1838.489 --> 1841.519
not gonna come on him anymore

1839.899 --> 1844.609
even though he said oh yeah yeah despite

1841.519 --> 1846.23
all of this you're banned from chat but

1844.609 --> 1847.1589999999999
you can still come on the panel yeah I

1846.23 --> 1854.3890000000001
forget about it

1847.159 --> 1857.0590000000002
that's not how that works I'm gonna be

1854.389 --> 1860.84
enslaved by your specific little social

1857.059 --> 1866.379
contracts thank you very much take the

1860.84 --> 1866.379
whole package as is or not anyway

1868.08 --> 1874.08
yeah Brendan cook I am always welcome

1870.88 --> 1874.0800000000002
here because this is my channel

1884.95 --> 1888.13
[Music]

1890.43 --> 1899.04
no really Chantry wood so what does that

1893.34 --> 1902.55
mean because Flat Earth is a is more

1899.04 --> 1904.35
like a name tag really than a technical

1902.55 --> 1906.51
statement so if you're gonna say no

1904.35 --> 1907.98
proof that's now you're getting

1906.51 --> 1910.22
technical if you're gonna say there's no

1907.98 --> 1915.1200000000001
proof of flatter so what do you mean

1910.22 --> 1918.8600000000001
don't you tell me scoobert Dracula go

1915.12 --> 1920.4599999999998
alive in 30 minutes or with the premiere

1918.86 --> 1928.3799999999999
another Meetup

1920.46 --> 1936.6000000000001
nice just got the pop-up um so yeah you

1928.38 --> 1938.49
tell me gentry would there's no proof of

1936.6 --> 1949.05
that's that's repeating the same

1938.49 --> 1955.29
question what do you mean when you say

1949.05 --> 1959.55
no proof Flat Earth what are you talking

1955.29 --> 1964.29
about a geometrical aspect a geometrical

1959.55 --> 1966.57
element to the realm we know or what

1964.29 --> 1968.61
exactly are you implying are you

1966.57 --> 1972.09
implying it's not the disk model

1968.61 --> 1974.04
surrounded by a dough with the North

1972.09 --> 1977.1299999999999
Pole at the middle what are you saying

1974.04 --> 1981.1499999999999
no proof when you say no proof you have

1977.13 --> 1983.91
to be more specific you can't just say

1981.15 --> 1987.14
something really default and get away

1983.91 --> 1990.9
with that if you're gonna say no I I

1987.14 --> 1992.94
claim this for my globe or even for the

1990.9 --> 1995.42
Flat Earth you you better well know what

1992.94 --> 1995.42
you're saying

2000.11 --> 2005.6999999999998
[Music]

2003.03 --> 2008.58
all right and then you got a good

2005.7 --> 2011.88
question what what's the proof the proof

2008.58 --> 2015.98
and not the proof of a globe earth right

2011.88 --> 2015.98
that's a legitimate question

2016.52 --> 2023.94
we got the technical schematics worked

2020.34 --> 2026.3999999999999
out perfectly in order to inquire upon

2023.94 --> 2029.1000000000001
the details of the claimed proof

2026.4 --> 2040.44
surrounding the presupposed globe earth

2029.1 --> 2043.85
in the outer space universe yeah but

2040.44 --> 2046.8600000000001
again you you say again the same there's

2043.85 --> 2050.37
again Chantry woods I mean there is no

2046.86 --> 2052.29
proof there's loads to show that the

2050.37 --> 2055.62
earth is a globe where's the proof of it

2052.29 --> 2057.54
okay right so now you got a dome the

2055.62 --> 2060.75
first time you actually point it at

2057.54 --> 2063.96
something specific thanks for trying

2060.75 --> 2066.51
because I thought yeah you actually took

2063.96 --> 2068.01
out the words Flat Earth when you said

2066.51 --> 2069.96
there's no proof so I thought you were

2068.01 --> 2072.8990000000003
gonna retract even more in your

2069.96 --> 2074.76
statement but yeah the proof of a dome

2072.899 --> 2078.45
yeah you got a good point well in all

2074.76 --> 2081.0600000000004
depends on when you're gonna go with not

2078.45 --> 2087.06
believing the globe what you think it is

2081.06 --> 2090.0499999999997
like and yeah what would be more

2087.06 --> 2093.23
realistic that's out there and what is

2090.05 --> 2097.44
inevitable to be out there is it a dome

2093.23 --> 2099.39
it's an enclosure that's for sure the

2097.44 --> 2104.31
realm isn't closed or there would be no

2099.39 --> 2108.0
gas pressure but what is the enclosure

2104.31 --> 2112.2599999999998
like well there are some kind of hints

2108.0 --> 2116.72
at least that there is a receiving in

2112.26 --> 2120.09
height perhaps of the ceiling somehow

2116.72 --> 2124.23
it's like but it's only written it I'm

2120.09 --> 2127.6200000000003
referring now to the supposed test where

2124.23 --> 2129.3
they put out flights towards the south

2127.62 --> 2131.43
after a certain latitude and they

2129.3 --> 2133.23
supposedly crash it's it's still kind of

2131.43 --> 2135.73
fake in my personal opinion but that's

2133.23 --> 2139.72
like really the only

2135.73 --> 2142.39
type of indicator that the world may be

2139.72 --> 2144.97
anything other than just having a

2142.39 --> 2148.93
flattop everywhere that there might be a

2144.97 --> 2151.8689999999997
receding somewhere and it could be look

2148.93 --> 2155.22
I forgot to put it out yesterday but

2151.869 --> 2160.77
technically I've thought about a Rukiya

2155.22 --> 2167.22
arc right so now I'm gonna get a bit odd

2160.77 --> 2169.84
way but thinking about part of the

2167.22 --> 2172.54
conceptualizations and 3d modeling of

2169.84 --> 2176.05
what free-energy

2172.54 --> 2182.17
did with his rectangular looping visuals

2176.05 --> 2184.96
and then thinking okay an arc so if the

2182.17 --> 2189.1
earth presupposing now that it's looping

2184.96 --> 2191.859
a rectangular in some way what if it's

2189.1 --> 2198.52
not exactly a flat top what if north to

2191.859 --> 2201.1
south is actually an arc with yeah the

2198.52 --> 2207.369
equator being directly over the highest

2201.1 --> 2208.99
point of the realm could be but yeah

2207.369 --> 2215.17
that would not be a dome it would be

2208.99 --> 2217.6499999999996
more like a pointy arc at just shaping

2215.17 --> 2222.06
the things and the words in my mind

2217.65 --> 2222.06
adapting it to the potential

2229.25 --> 2235.349
but yeah there's a there is a likelihood

2232.38 --> 2242.099
that if there is a touchdown of a

2235.349 --> 2248.01
supposed surrounding oh yeah of the

2242.099 --> 2251.6090000000004
realms encasement then why would it be

2248.01 --> 2255.779
like a half a bubble necessarily why

2251.609 --> 2260.64
wouldn't it just be like this

2255.779 --> 2263.16
that's exactly how free energy put it in

2260.64 --> 2269.339
his model that's how he showed he

2263.16 --> 2271.3489999999997
thought the barriers would be like but

2269.339 --> 2273.859
he seemed quite adamant as to putting

2271.349 --> 2277.17
them touching letting them touch down

2273.859 --> 2280.47
north and south and yeah I don't know

2277.17 --> 2287.94
where he based that final conclusion on

2280.47 --> 2295.319
or if it it just didn't had he had to

2287.94 --> 2297.0
choose for his modeling I don't know you

2295.319 --> 2299.67
know to be fair I would even like to

2297.0 --> 2302.46
hear from him where he got the concept

2299.67 --> 2306.319
how would that came into being how it

2302.46 --> 2306.319
yeah I'd love to hear that

2315.81 --> 2318.65
all right

2318.84 --> 2327.06
yeah Chantry would what you think is

2322.26 --> 2329.7900000000004
gravity I know you haven't looked into

2327.06 --> 2332.2799999999997
the deep roots of all that and their

2329.79 --> 2335.25
significance within this scape of

2332.28 --> 2338.25
accepted scientific knowledge and you'll

2335.25 --> 2341.49
find out that gravity literally is a

2338.25 --> 2346.95
rumor that's been actively perpetuated

2341.49 --> 2349.95
as kind of a folklore obstacle to

2346.95 --> 2352.29
deflect a lot of attention concerning

2349.95 --> 2355.0099999999998
technicals it's just there but if

2352.29 --> 2357.62
there's no foundation even the original

2355.01 --> 2360.51
conceptualize er of it Newton himself

2357.62 --> 2362.91
it's officially written statement that

2360.51 --> 2365.2200000000003
he did not claim hypotheses for

2362.91 --> 2367.23
gravitation well that's telling you

2365.22 --> 2369.5699999999997
something that tells you it's just

2367.23 --> 2373.56
conceptual it doesn't claim it to be

2369.57 --> 2376.11
literally real so yeah if you then

2373.56 --> 2378.18
realize that that the foundations of

2376.11 --> 2381.8700000000003
that rumor that you've been taught is

2378.18 --> 2385.2599999999998
everywhere but not grounded in actual

2381.87 --> 2386.7
solid evidence then you got a bit of a

2385.26 --> 2389.88
problem and you're gonna look around

2386.7 --> 2393.1499999999996
like okay but it's still being used what

2389.88 --> 2397.8
what is it then well then you bump into

2393.15 --> 2400.26
Einstein of course is pseudo Ramon Yin

2397.8 --> 2402.3900000000003
for space conceptualizations of gravity

2400.26 --> 2406.17
and how it is actually like a

2402.39 --> 2410.1299999999997
fundamental element to the the

2406.17 --> 2415.19
speciality of the realm itself just

2410.13 --> 2415.19
completely out of reach and yeah

2415.25 --> 2420.36
resulting effectively in that people

2417.72 --> 2425.97
don't know what it is and what it even

2420.36 --> 2429.21
does it just is used as like a paint

2425.97 --> 2431.2799999999997
brush color spectrum to paint in the

2429.21 --> 2434.2200000000003
galaxy and just say now gravity just

2431.28 --> 2436.26
bends all these things like this without

2434.22 --> 2439.1099999999997
actually explaining how that's kind of

2436.26 --> 2442.86
what's been done with that as well but

2439.11 --> 2445.05
people still just use the Newtonian

2442.86 --> 2447.7200000000003
basic principles thinking that is a

2445.05 --> 2451.26
force it's like that but there's no

2447.72 --> 2452.4599999999996
hypothesis for this and Einstein also

2451.26 --> 2460.1400000000003
deflects

2452.46 --> 2461.85
the notion so yeah we don't deny gravity

2460.14 --> 2466.1
we just figured out that it doesn't

2461.85 --> 2482.67
exist that's just a rumor that's been

2466.1 --> 2488.88
perpetuated like crazy any more

2482.67 --> 2491.28
questions all right okay yeah Chantry

2488.88 --> 2493.44
would ya mind you're going by the whole

2491.28 --> 2496.92
script so this is somebody default

2493.44 --> 2500.25
script asking they might be doing a

2496.92 --> 2502.56
genuine inquiry and just put together

2500.25 --> 2504.75
some question asking them one by one but

2502.56 --> 2506.82
anyway I'd like to point out that your

2504.75 --> 2509.13
next statement Chantry would why do you

2506.82 --> 2514.65
deny everything that proves a globe

2509.13 --> 2517.11
Earth including images from space and

2514.65 --> 2519.3
sunrises red-letter right all that so

2517.11 --> 2521.73
yeah you already put the word right

2519.3 --> 2528.21
there images from space you know what an

2521.73 --> 2530.3
image is it's not a photograph an image

2528.21 --> 2535.92
can be a lot of things

2530.3 --> 2536.46
it's basically a visual but yeah it's

2535.92 --> 2538.56
correct

2536.46 --> 2539.91
they call it images from space every

2538.56 --> 2544.0499999999997
time you get to see one of these

2539.91 --> 2546.7799999999997
pictures it's an image they say it is an

2544.05 --> 2548.3700000000003
image it's not a photograph well that's

2546.78 --> 2550.8300000000004
kind of telling because about a

2548.37 --> 2553.2
photograph you know a photograph is very

2550.83 --> 2555.45
specifically a photograph because when

2553.2 --> 2557.22
you change things about the photograph

2555.45 --> 2559.5299999999997
afterwards it's not really a photograph

2557.22 --> 2561.9599999999996
anymore becomes an image it's edited

2559.53 --> 2565.34
just worked on so then you can't call it

2561.96 --> 2570.7200000000003
a photograph anymore it's worked on so

2565.34 --> 2576.6600000000003
why isn't there a photograph of globe

2570.72 --> 2581.1899999999996
earth why do we only get images Gentry

2576.66 --> 2583.2
would a photos photo show me the photos

2581.19 --> 2586.29
Chantry would can can you find some

2583.2 --> 2591.8689999999997
example of photos what actually says

2586.29 --> 2593.43
it's a photo the globe from Earth as

2591.869 --> 2595.4900000000002
you're looking by the way you might bump

2593.43 --> 2599.0899999999997
into a certain video that's been widely

2595.49 --> 2602.8399999999997
circulating that is a guy that actually

2599.09 --> 2606.8900000000003
presented some of these globe images

2602.84 --> 2611.4
yeah on on the mic telling everyone yeah

2606.89 --> 2613.859
yeah we have to we have to like put it

2611.4 --> 2615.96
together in order because we can't take

2613.859 --> 2620.19
it in one single image for some reason

2615.96 --> 2624.45
so it's photoshopped because it has to

2620.19 --> 2627.42
be sufficient by somebody working for

2624.45 --> 2630.0899999999997
NASA that worked on the images the

2627.42 --> 2636.9900000000002
official put out images of the globe or

2630.09 --> 2639.5
so explain to me why why would a picture

2636.99 --> 2643.0499999999997
of the globe earth have to be photoshop

2639.5 --> 2646.65
it could be because it naturally doesn't

2643.05 --> 2657.0800000000004
look like a globe could that be the

2646.65 --> 2657.08
reason it's are any more questions

2664.4 --> 2673.19
there is photographs they were taken in

2669.999 --> 2678.3689999999997
1947 fear occurred before digital photos

2673.19 --> 2678.369
cool so could you show me that

2683.28 --> 2687.63
because yeah of course there were

2685.41 --> 2690.39
photographs being taken I'm pretty sure

2687.63 --> 2694.23
that that globe earth pictures the

2690.39 --> 2696.74
images have been created using actual

2694.23 --> 2699.15
photographs pretty sure about that

2696.74 --> 2707.7
doesn't mean that it is a photograph

2699.15 --> 2709.4100000000003
though because it's been worked on so

2707.7 --> 2711.4199999999996
but yeah Chantry would if you're

2709.41 --> 2715.02
claiming that there is an actual

2711.42 --> 2717.2400000000002
photograph of the globe earth from 1947

2715.02 --> 2719.61
yeah please me link me up with that

2717.24 --> 2722.1299999999997
that's interesting

2719.61 --> 2727.8
I doubt it highly doubtful but

2722.13 --> 2731.61
interesting okay Patrick Rodriguez

2727.8 --> 2733.71
question go ahead look it up do your

2731.61 --> 2736.53
research no no no no you're the one

2733.71 --> 2738.78
making the claim that exists so you're

2736.53 --> 2741.5
the one that's gonna have to provide for

2738.78 --> 2741.5
the claim

2751.14 --> 2756.96
right I got questions that yes no I do

2754.859 --> 2762.269
not think gravity exists I just

2756.96 --> 2766.099
explained it in detail what's going

2762.269 --> 2768.2099999999996
around as gravity our rumors are miss

2766.099 --> 2770.67
conceptualizations of elements that can

2768.21 --> 2774.509
absolutely be explained in the real

2770.67 --> 2776.13
world with scientific basis mainly the

2774.509 --> 2778.64
relative density theory and I've

2776.13 --> 2783.6600000000003
specialized in that working that out

2778.64 --> 2786.299
gravity is it's an aberration it's it's

2783.66 --> 2788.5789999999997
a make-belief that's not routed in

2786.299 --> 2791.299
reality it's a conceptualization there

2788.579 --> 2791.299
is no gravity

2796.96 --> 2801.52
really really Gentry would playing silly

2801.01 --> 2806.98
games

2801.52 --> 2808.6
am i sounds like you're the one playing

2806.98 --> 2810.19
silly games you're the ones that making

2808.6 --> 2811.81
that is making all these claims you

2810.19 --> 2816.64
started out by making claim there's no

2811.81 --> 2818.5
proof for the Flat Earth okay and you

2816.64 --> 2821.95
didn't even weren't even specific about

2818.5 --> 2823.87
it so then I caught you basically saying

2821.95 --> 2827.74
the dome and then I actually gave you

2823.87 --> 2831.5499999999997
that and talked about it a bit right so

2827.74 --> 2833.89
how is that spinning out what games what

2831.55 --> 2835.54
silly games am i playing it sounds like

2833.89 --> 2838.3199999999997
more like you're playing silly games

2835.54 --> 2838.32
Chantry would

2856.75 --> 2860.44
toad so you're gonna refer it back to

2859.0 --> 2863.859
your original statement do you have

2860.44 --> 2869.109
proof for a flat earth again

2863.859 --> 2875.23
DS specifying alright well I definitely

2869.109 --> 2879.52
have proof that we're not living that

2875.23 --> 2884.7
our realm is not inside of a giant outer

2879.52 --> 2888.609
space vacuum any sort that's like

2884.7 --> 2891.21
astronomically bigger in volume than the

2888.609 --> 2893.98
space that we are familiar with here

2891.21 --> 2897.03
pretty pretty sure I can prove that

2893.98 --> 2900.73
based on the natural antecedent

2897.03 --> 2905.65
necessary antecedent for gas pressure to

2900.73 --> 2908.65
exist so there's one and then yeah the

2905.65 --> 2912.099
lack of curvature to seeing too far too

2908.65 --> 2918.28
many times that can never be possible

2912.099 --> 2922.44
without literally maconnais ting visuals

2918.28 --> 2926.8590000000004
and yeah trying to dis contort how

2922.44 --> 2931.26
optics actually work in order to justify

2926.859 --> 2934.48
the lack of curvature that is present

2931.26 --> 2937.7200000000003
disproving any geometrical literal shape

2934.48 --> 2941.109
about the earth there is no curvature

2937.72 --> 2943.6899999999996
and the horizon is not the leading edge

2941.109 --> 2946.45
of a sphere provably so it's an it's an

2943.69 --> 2949.39
apparent visual side effect of

2946.45 --> 2955.48
perspective and sight itself when you

2949.39 --> 2957.7599999999998
look past flat surface eventually that

2955.48 --> 2960.58
flat server it surface is gonna

2957.76 --> 2963.4500000000003
apparently meet the sky and things

2960.58 --> 2966.4
beyond will be start to be subjected to

2963.45 --> 2969.91
Mirage in mirror mirror effects and

2966.4 --> 2974.17
complete lack of sight due to lack of

2969.91 --> 2977.56
air clarity but where that apparent

2974.17 --> 2981.58
position is of the sky meeting the

2977.56 --> 2984.82
ground it's arbitrary it's literally a

2981.58 --> 2986.7999999999997
visual spot it's not a geometrical

2984.82 --> 2989.9700000000003
feature you can prove that it is it

2986.8 --> 2992.8590000000004
moves and it cut this

2989.97 --> 2995.529
suppose a geometrical feature of the

2992.859 --> 3000.96
horizon effect it comes into being very

2995.529 --> 3004.859
close by if you just lower down lower

3000.96 --> 3007.23
down your sights the camera put it over

3004.859 --> 3011.13
a flat surface then that horizon is

3007.23 --> 3013.92
gonna pop up very close by even though

3011.13 --> 3015.42
you can definitely confirm about the

3013.92 --> 3021.1800000000003
thing you're looking over that it is

3015.42 --> 3026.4300000000003
geometrically flat so yeah there is no

3021.18 --> 3032.1299999999997
proof of curvature and the next best

3026.43 --> 3035.6299999999997
alternative is that well the realm we

3032.13 --> 3038.369
walk on seems to be geometrically flat

3035.63 --> 3040.38
now that's just an aspect about the

3038.369 --> 3047.67
surface it doesn't say what the entire

3040.38 --> 3051.69
realm is but that factor it's just the

3047.67 --> 3055.25
only way to even get around it or try to

3051.69 --> 3058.049
disprove it is to literally prove that

3055.25 --> 3060.66
physical geometrical feature about the

3058.049 --> 3065.52
earth in some way and there's no visuals

3060.66 --> 3067.3489999999997
out there that can prove this and the

3065.52 --> 3071.67
more people have tried even on the

3067.349 --> 3074.1600000000003
global side the more proof actually

3071.67 --> 3077.7000000000003
leaks in that it's just absolutely near

3074.16 --> 3080.3689999999997
not there because it's just way too many

3077.7 --> 3083.819
times that you can see extremely far and

3080.369 --> 3089.25
that can never happen on anything other

3083.819 --> 3093.079
than a flat surface doesn't work oh here

3089.25 --> 3093.079
we come with the flights the trolls

3093.859 --> 3097.339
stuff isn't it

3106.11 --> 3112.6800000000003
yeah okay an interesting question there

3109.71 --> 3114.33
I will incinerate your Fantasyland do

3112.68 --> 3117.18
you think some rich people could have

3114.33 --> 3119.13
entire cities built beyond the areas

3117.18 --> 3124.1099999999997
where we're not allowed to go or

3119.13 --> 3126.9900000000002
supposed to go yeah absolutely but not

3124.11 --> 3129.6600000000003
cities it would be more like a giant

3126.99 --> 3131.66
vacation resort probably with a lot of

3129.66 --> 3133.89
sex slaves and all that disgusting [ __ ]

3131.66 --> 3136.83
wouldn't be real cities it would just be

3133.89 --> 3139.74
a lot of very insanely large mansions

3136.83 --> 3141.69
and party it would be like a giant party

3139.74 --> 3145.7999999999997
realm to them that's probably what the

3141.69 --> 3149.55
end would end up using it for my opinion

3145.8 --> 3157.46
but think it's taken by the people that

3149.55 --> 3160.5
I think have taken it who knows but

3157.46 --> 3163.77
literally built cities and let it become

3160.5 --> 3167.22
its own autonomous culture hidden away

3163.77 --> 3169.91
from from the rest of the realm I I kind

3167.22 --> 3169.91
of doubt it

3184.63 --> 3189.2200000000003
because it doesn't make any sense how

3187.45 --> 3200.68
would such a thing be maintained what

3189.22 --> 3203.14
would they be doing you know at best I

3200.68 --> 3205.2999999999997
could imagine that for example the

3203.14 --> 3208.27
original stationing of the soldiers and

3205.3 --> 3211.1800000000003
all that that they would kind of like

3208.27 --> 3212.95
make it into a fortress situation where

3211.18 --> 3215.7
the military become permanently

3212.95 --> 3220.5099999999998
stationed and have families there have

3215.7 --> 3223.0299999999997
yeah families brought over there to

3220.51 --> 3227.4
become a permanent outpost and then that

3223.03 --> 3230.6200000000003
military setup would kind of turn into a

3227.4 --> 3232.03
city I guess held together by the

3230.62 --> 3233.68
military and the family and the

3232.03 --> 3234.7000000000003
logistics surrounding all that and

3233.68 --> 3236.8599999999997
whatever they're going to be doing

3234.7 --> 3248.5899999999997
farming who knows what's possible out

3236.86 --> 3251.6400000000003
there and I don't know I just I just

3248.59 --> 3251.6400000000003
don't see it

3253.2 --> 3263.0389999999998
too many things that could grow out of

3255.42 --> 3265.89
control Tom thank you to the last a good

3263.039 --> 3268.17
night yeah I had read wells because yeah

3265.89 --> 3272.73
our government is literally attacking

3268.17 --> 3276.539
our country with insane policies that

3272.73 --> 3278.22
that are just so damaging it's like not

3276.539 --> 3281.46
just climate change

3278.22 --> 3287.18
co2 nonsense tax no they're even putting

3281.46 --> 3293.88
on the whole what is it six of the herbs

3287.18 --> 3296.64
nitrogen nonsense and it's it's

3293.88 --> 3299.5190000000002
literally just a senseless attack it's a

3296.64 --> 3302.1299999999997
senseless attack because the country was

3299.519 --> 3304.47
kind of doing kind of good it was

3302.13 --> 3306.9
reported as like growing in the region's

3304.47 --> 3309.359
getting better and now they're literally

3306.9 --> 3314.01
attacking the economy straight on

3309.359 --> 3316.0789999999997
straight out attack political attack on

3314.01 --> 3318.529
the economy on the Dutch economy it's

3316.079 --> 3318.529
idiotic

3333.7 --> 3340.6899999999996
no kamikaze Gilmore the magnetic point

3338.67 --> 3343.15
supposedly in a South Pole does not

3340.69 --> 3346.7200000000003
exist there are two magnetic south poles

3343.15 --> 3352.69
and they're not at the actual Antarctic

3346.72 --> 3356.3799999999997
itself so that story's complete nonsense

3352.69 --> 3358.27
there yeah the idea that the ball North

3356.38 --> 3360.51
Pole South Pole idea is just complete

3358.27 --> 3363.13
nonsense there's extensive magnetic maps

3360.51 --> 3365.34
with the direction of the magnetics and

3363.13 --> 3367.9900000000002
the intensities two different maps and

3365.34 --> 3371.92
it's just not the way they say it works

3367.99 --> 3373.87
very simple not in that idea of the

3371.92 --> 3385.3
globe magnetics it just doesn't work

3373.87 --> 3389.47
it's nonsense it's getting really

3385.3 --> 3392.28
annoying Lottie I mean it really

3389.47 --> 3397.1099999999997
annoying you're you're like

3392.28 --> 3397.11
disrespecting me it's not funny

3402.7 --> 3411.64
Oh Hagrid wells are you gonna just be Oh

3407.62 --> 3414.2999999999997
everybody's doomed again because I get

3411.64 --> 3422.02
really sick of that attitude but

3414.3 --> 3425.6200000000003
whatever say what you need to say it's

3422.02 --> 3429.3
not really helping you after the

3425.62 --> 3429.2999999999997
statement you made before that but

3434.66 --> 3443.719
just a magnetic worth okay

3440.59 --> 3443.719
[Music]

3458.67 --> 3463.869
well

3460.93 --> 3467.98
well depends on exactly what you mean by

3463.869 --> 3473.17
atoms I got question but I did I'd say

3467.98 --> 3479.009
that the way it has been conceptualized

3473.17 --> 3479.009
within chemistry it definitely works

3479.13 --> 3485.589
now whatever is presupposed beyond that

3483.63 --> 3488.38
that's another matter

3485.589 --> 3495.67
I don't know what the fundamental

3488.38 --> 3499.4990000000003
material particle really is like I just

3495.67 --> 3505.4990000000003
know there's these quantity ratios that

3499.499 --> 3505.499
that work that's it

3518.06 --> 3521.7799999999997
when does something become a

3519.56 --> 3525.68
presupposition well when you're gonna

3521.78 --> 3527.96
free suppose it without having actual

3525.68 --> 3531.7599999999998
viable proof for it and you're gonna say

3527.96 --> 3535.73
like what if this was the situation

3531.76 --> 3540.5600000000004
think about it like oh imagine this what

3535.73 --> 3543.08
if this that's free supposition now you

3540.56 --> 3545.09
don't have to necessarily say it and it

3543.08 --> 3547.2799999999997
can still be a presupposition it would

3545.09 --> 3548.6000000000004
just be a hidden presupposition doesn't

3547.28 --> 3550.3
mean it's not a presupposition

3548.6 --> 3553.79
if you're going to claim something

3550.3 --> 3557.3
without the proof as part of your

3553.79 --> 3559.64
explanation or whatever yeah that's a

3557.3 --> 3563.1800000000003
presupposition and you're basically

3559.64 --> 3565.22
trying to force everyone to believe too

3563.18 --> 3568.3599999999997
quickly believe certain aspects without

3565.22 --> 3572.6499999999996
providing proof then you're presupposing

3568.36 --> 3572.65
you're forcing everyone to presuppose

3592.69 --> 3595.41
but

3595.74 --> 3602.7599999999998
yeah anyway I think I'm gonna round out

3598.56 --> 3605.849
the show it's gone on long enough now so

3602.76 --> 3607.4100000000003

you so much and yeah I will be back

3666.48 --> 3671.88
tomorrow flattered of the earlybird

3667.71 --> 3673.5
number 350 and ya know Flat Earth debate

3671.88 --> 3675.3
of course because Saturday there will be

3673.5 --> 3677.73
a ball busters I think it's live but I'm

3675.3 --> 3679.92
probably not gonna be on it since it's

3677.73 --> 3681.93
gonna be all discord but maybe it's

3679.92 --> 3690.7400000000002
gonna be all Skype and in that case I'll

3681.93 --> 3690.74
I probably will join so we'll see yeah

3691.76 --> 3702.0200000000004
hashtag me fuh of course indeed and

3695.089 --> 3702.02
until the next show keep it flat

3702.98 --> 3725.909
[Music]

3729.06 --> 3731.12
you

3739.12 --> 3741.18
you
