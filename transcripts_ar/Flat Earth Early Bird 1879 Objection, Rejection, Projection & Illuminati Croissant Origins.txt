weekend oh

well

437.319 --> 444.36
ah right so what's going on guys what's

440.199 --> 447.16
up what's up what's out there I watched

444.36 --> 449.599
half that movie that somebody sent me

447.16 --> 455.12
the physician it's really interest like

449.599 --> 455.12
that's a really good movie man like very

461.28 --> 465.19899999999996
beautiful I'm like halfway

466.52 --> 470.599
now great it's very

472.039 --> 476.44
interesting hey doons good to see

478.319 --> 481.319
you

508.24 --> 511.24
h

516.35 --> 519.559
[Music]

522.62 --> 528.16
[Music]

525.839 --> 532.6800000000001
hello gentle

528.16 --> 532.68
bear biblical biblical

533.04 --> 536.04
what

538.2 --> 545.5600000000001
hello or you mean the movie is

542.56 --> 548.16
biblical maybe I haven't really paid too

545.56 --> 552.1999999999999
much attention to that it's just there's

548.16 --> 552.1999999999999
a lot of interesting detail

552.48 --> 558.6800000000001
and yeah I mean I'm still watching it

555.6 --> 558.6800000000001
but it's been very

565.76 --> 571.12
interesting like there's certainly like

568.16 --> 574.12
the the suspense disbelief like

571.12 --> 576.839
of of that place and that time they did

574.12 --> 576.839
it really

576.88 --> 581.64
well it's kind of funny though that they

579.32 --> 585.44
all talk

581.64 --> 588.64
English with like accents and all that

585.44 --> 588.6400000000001
that's kind of funny about

589.04 --> 594.0
it because in reality that seems kind of

598.12 --> 603.519
unlikely but I mean you're kind of like

601.6 --> 605.0790000000001
you have to like separate yourself from

603.519 --> 609.399
the movie to kind of pick up on that

605.079 --> 611.2399999999999
even so they have like a they they made

609.399 --> 614.36
the language

611.24 --> 616.9590000000001
easier for communication

614.36 --> 618.6800000000001
sake CU in reality they would have had

616.959 --> 621.8389999999999
to like really figure out how to

618.68 --> 621.8389999999999
communicate about these

622.36 --> 631.04
things pretty sure that in in Egypt and

627.64 --> 631.04
all that

631.56 --> 638.4399999999999
like they're not going to be speaking

634.8 --> 641.88
English at that time definitely not

638.44 --> 644.9200000000001
right but like I only picked up on that

641.88 --> 647.079
like when I was halfway it was like wait

644.92 --> 650.639
what they're talking English that's

647.079 --> 653.3199999999999
weird but like yeah it's just very

650.639 --> 653.32
interesting

654.12 --> 658.04
so it's

656.24 --> 661.76
[Music]

658.04 --> 661.76
forgiven watch

661.88 --> 664.88
Apocalypto

666.079 --> 674.4399999999999
H I don't remember that movie I think I

669.76 --> 674.4399999999999
probably watched it at some point not

685.0 --> 691.8
sure right that and om Benjamin was also

689.2 --> 691.8000000000001
interesting

700.0 --> 707.279
again the

702.12 --> 711.279
whole like the the Lord rosch was

707.279 --> 713.76
good joke thing is like really funny and

711.279 --> 716.36
like there's some just legitimate points

713.76 --> 717.959
behind it but I mean it does overlook a

716.36 --> 720.32
bunch of

717.959 --> 723.959
things but I mean technically he's

720.32 --> 723.9590000000001
correct about it that's what makes it so

730.04 --> 735.24
funny right so yeah that's been

733.04 --> 737.959
interesting let's see what else what's

735.24 --> 737.9590000000001
going on out

747.88 --> 750.88
there

769.04 --> 773.76
i p

770.76 --> 773.76
FP

777.12 --> 781.48
what I don't know what you're you're

779.0 --> 781.48
talking about

792.04 --> 795.639
duper profile

799.92 --> 802.92
picture

802.959 --> 809.3599999999999
ah thank you for telling me that derer I

807.76 --> 811.56

809.36 --> 811.5600000000001
all

812.53 --> 815.64
[Music]

818.199 --> 823.16

821.24 --> 825.399
called

823.16 --> 829.279
Kil bear

825.399 --> 829.279
what oh cocaine

832.079 --> 837.7589999999999
Bear yeah I heard that's a movie I heard

835.6 --> 839.5600000000001
that through Owen Benjamin like I don't

837.759 --> 841.639
know

839.56 --> 845.92
never watch

841.639 --> 845.92
that hey clutch good to see

849.71 --> 861.07
[Music]

864.65 --> 870.68
[Music]

867.68 --> 870.68
you

902.24 --> 909.04
all right so yeah I'm

905.0 --> 911.32
not I'm not like slowed or bugged it's

909.04 --> 911.3199999999999
just

911.959 --> 916.3199999999999
that trouble starting up

916.399 --> 920.6
today it's weird I just don't feel all

918.88 --> 925.759
that talkative but I mean that might

920.6 --> 925.759
just change as as the show keeps

927.6 --> 930.6
going

941.36 --> 948.12
also it's kind of weird to realize that

943.639 --> 950.519
I've like almost entirely quit

948.12 --> 953.839
cannabis it's not entirely I mean I

950.519 --> 953.839
still have some and I'm

955.72 --> 959.72
like later in the evening I do smoke

958.24 --> 963.6
some of

959.72 --> 965.839
it but it's like yeah I'm like really

963.6 --> 970.279
I've cut down also because it's like

965.839 --> 970.2790000000001
influencing me in a way that's like not

970.399 --> 976.639
great it actually tends to

974.24 --> 980.88
like yeah

976.639 --> 984.48
trigger the anxiety and stuff so I'm

980.88 --> 987.399
like just smoking tobacco

984.48 --> 989.9590000000001
mostly and that's working out fine but

987.399 --> 991.639
it's just kind of weird

989.959 --> 994.6389999999999
like I'm used to like

991.639 --> 994.639
smoking

1007.48 --> 1011.9590000000001
plenty you saw a video people bear

1010.279 --> 1016.72
coming to PE

1011.959 --> 1016.7199999999999
wow those people are extremely

1017.48 --> 1020.48
irresponsible

1023.679 --> 1031.28
duper I mean they specific like

1028.679 --> 1033.2800000000002
Forest uh guardians or whatever they

1031.28 --> 1035.079
specifically say don't feed the bear I

1033.28 --> 1037.199
mean it's like a classic saying don't

1035.079 --> 1041.319
feed the bear because if you feed

1037.199 --> 1044.559
them they'll like start coming up to

1041.319 --> 1047.9189999999999
people expect expecting to get

1044.559 --> 1051.72
fed and like if they don't get fed they

1047.919 --> 1051.72
might then just like attack

1062.84 --> 1067.12
people so yeah don't feed the

1077.4 --> 1081.3600000000001
bear because if you do they'll start

1079.96 --> 1084.64
mugging

1081.36 --> 1087.4799999999998
Bears or they'll start mugging people

1084.64 --> 1090.2
basically once they realize that people

1087.48 --> 1090.2
will give them

1096.12 --> 1100.76
food sounds like

1098.679 --> 1104.48
trolls

1100.76 --> 1107.32
uh well bears were there before human

1104.48 --> 1110.32

1542.6 --> 1547.36
okay this is starting to look like it's

1545.12 --> 1547.36
a

1549.12 --> 1553.9189999999999
ruse I don't think Ginger bear is

1551.399 --> 1553.9189999999999
actually a

1556.679 --> 1561.96
bear

1559.159 --> 1565.7600000000002
and I don't think that's a bear either

1561.96 --> 1565.76
I'm just going to kick you out

1566.799 --> 1569.799
bye

1571.32 --> 1574.559
yeah they're

1575.039 --> 1578.96
trolls they're trolls that are going to

1577.24 --> 1582.36
pose like Bears just to come here and

1578.96 --> 1586.6000000000001
tell me how boring I am so that's fake I

1582.36 --> 1589.6
know it is not falling for a

1586.6 --> 1589.6
[Â __Â ]

1589.9 --> 1593.15
[Music]

1606.44 --> 1610.559
about the technique you had a kidney

1608.039 --> 1612.679
issue back pain suddenly disappeared you

1610.559 --> 1615.799
forgot about it oh that's

1612.679 --> 1615.799
fine I

1616.2 --> 1621.8400000000001
mean I was wasn't entirely sure like

1619.96 --> 1623.559
even if you were going to notice it I

1621.84 --> 1628.0
just felt called to do

1623.559 --> 1631.1589999999999
it and yeah the I

1628.0 --> 1633.6
mean these days in my focus with the

1631.159 --> 1636.7990000000002
applying the technique it is like really

1633.6 --> 1639.36
heart liver kidney so those are very

1636.799 --> 1643.0
prominent and they are like in with the

1639.36 --> 1645.36
subtle bodies and all that so if you had

1643.0 --> 1648.36
some kind of issue with it and it

1645.36 --> 1651.399
disappeared then

1648.36 --> 1655.4399999999998
I am not surprised about that but happy

1651.399 --> 1655.4399999999998
to hearg I'm glad that

1655.6 --> 1659.8799999999999
uh I'm very glad if something

1664.48 --> 1671.72
worked got to realize that I am

1667.039 --> 1671.72
relatively new to to even doing

1672.039 --> 1679.519
that I really originally learned it just

1674.96 --> 1679.519
to be able to do it with myself

1680.96 --> 1686.799
because I am typically in need of it I

1684.96 --> 1690.279
get

1686.799 --> 1692.84
destabilized comparatively

1690.279 --> 1696.559
easily like with other

1692.84 --> 1701.36
people and so I just need

1696.559 --> 1702.84
it especially when I'm like all wobbly

1701.36 --> 1705.8799999999999
like in the

1702.84 --> 1708.1999999999998
last few

1705.88 --> 1710.72
weeks right

1708.2 --> 1713.48
but again like when I'm like that I can

1710.72 --> 1714.64
it's like didn't I talk about that

1713.48 --> 1718.1200000000001
yesterday on the

1714.64 --> 1722.3200000000002
show when I feel like slightly feeble I

1718.12 --> 1722.32
also like have more Powers

1722.799 --> 1726.799
available that's kind of the the upside

1725.76 --> 1729.72
of

1726.799 --> 1734.2
it so it's like yeah I'll just try it

1729.72 --> 1736.3990000000001
out and it worked hey akumu good to see

1734.2 --> 1739.3990000000001
you

1736.399 --> 1739.399
clear

1757.12 --> 1761.08
somebody give you a song to dance

1761.88 --> 1766.3200000000002
around uh

1765.04 --> 1769.32
[Music]

1766.32 --> 1769.32
what

1776.799 --> 1780.039
oh that's

1781.48 --> 1784.579
[Music]

1789.78 --> 1792.98
[Music]

1796.32 --> 1801.869
hilarious

1797.95 --> 1801.8690000000001
[Music]

1822.72 --> 1826.72
Ben

1824.039 --> 1830.68
Johnston oh you changed your name no no

1826.72 --> 1832.3990000000001
no don't worry about it no I like

1830.68 --> 1834.919
[Music]

1832.399 --> 1836.7199999999998
it although you still have to bear in

1834.919 --> 1838.5590000000002
the picture so that's fine but I mean

1836.72 --> 1841.24
it's not because of you getting in here

1838.559 --> 1843.08
that's getting ideas that's just it's

1841.24 --> 1846.159
because people are coming over from

1843.08 --> 1848.0
Rumble that have noticed me and that are

1846.159 --> 1850.679
interested and the trolls are like

1848.0 --> 1852.76
trying to trolls are going around like

1850.679 --> 1856.24
literally trying to

1852.76 --> 1859.24
make drive everyone away every single

1856.24 --> 1859.24
person

1860.0 --> 1865.36
everyone it's like you have to be

1866.919 --> 1872.8400000000001
pretty what do you call

1870.24 --> 1874.76
that you have to be pretty sturdy to

1872.84 --> 1877.6
basically hang around with

1874.76 --> 1882.559
me because of the trolls they will try

1877.6 --> 1882.559
anything so I wouldn't worry too

1882.88 --> 1889.0
much but I mean just calling yourself

1886.32 --> 1891.24
Ben Johnston is is also fine whatever

1889.0 --> 1891.24
you

1899.279 --> 1904.44
prefer but I mean you're not the only

1901.6 --> 1906.639
bear that visits my chat right Woodwork

1904.44 --> 1909.48
and gunny bear

1906.639 --> 1913.8799999999999
and others that I might be forgetting

1909.48 --> 1913.88
right now so it's all

1914.559 --> 1923.48
good right I know how to spot an info

1917.919 --> 1923.48
trator it's been happening for like a

1934.12 --> 1940.4799999999998
decade oh you're called

1937.48 --> 1940.48
Johnston

1942.24 --> 1945.919
huh I didn't know

1946.08 --> 1949.08
that

1954.159 --> 1959.3990000000001
T pure the child no duper that's not the

1956.72 --> 1962.279
technique that's just called

1959.399 --> 1965.799
praying which may also

1962.279 --> 1968.2
work it's just that the technique is

1965.799 --> 1968.2
more

1976.039 --> 1979.039
specific

1984.24 --> 1989.039
yeah I

1986.08 --> 1992.08
mean if your mom used the

1989.039 --> 1994.44
technique then like people that use the

1992.08 --> 1996.84
technique are into rudol Steiner like

1994.44 --> 1996.8400000000001
you'll

1997.0 --> 2001.399
know it's not just a random

2005.96 --> 2008.96
thing

2012.72 --> 2021.159
okay so if your m mom is or was

2017.96 --> 2023.679
into into rudol Steiner then it would

2021.159 --> 2026.7600000000002
make sense that she might

2023.679 --> 2029.159
be using the

2026.76 --> 2031.2
technique although it's like not even

2029.159 --> 2034.279
all people that are into rud Steiner

2031.2 --> 2038.96
actually know about those things or are

2034.279 --> 2038.96
like healers like that

2040.24 --> 2043.96
there's actually a whole bunch of people

2042.2 --> 2045.88
that are like yeah we're with Rudolph

2043.96 --> 2048.079
Steiner they're like with the

2045.88 --> 2051.2000000000003
culture and with the groups and with

2048.079 --> 2054.44
Waldorf schools but they don't actually

2051.2 --> 2057.72
really read his stuff because it's like

2054.44 --> 2060.119
they just it freaks them out or

2057.72 --> 2061.839
something they just don't really

2060.119 --> 2063.9190000000003
understand

2061.839 --> 2068.879
it

2063.919 --> 2068.879
right got to realize that

2071.599 --> 2079.52
like even in at the school where I went

2074.32 --> 2083.599
to as a kid that was Waldorf School

2079.52 --> 2086.32
like the teachers like really knew about

2083.599 --> 2089.9190000000003
it they were like spiritually attuned

2086.32 --> 2092.2400000000002
very that was great that was like so

2089.919 --> 2094.72
effective especially for somebody like

2092.24 --> 2097.24
me because I could just see that they

2094.72 --> 2099.5989999999997
would actually see it they would see the

2097.24 --> 2102.5989999999997
things that other people like about me

2099.599 --> 2102.599
would just completely

2104.92 --> 2110.52
ignore right but I

2107.28 --> 2113.6400000000003
mean like even like the students their

2110.52 --> 2115.56
fellow kids like if you were being

2113.64 --> 2119.04
positive about rudol Steiner they would

2115.56 --> 2122.599
ridicule you CU they were like they

2119.04 --> 2122.599
didn't really know anything about

2123.24 --> 2127.7999999999997
it or they thought it was

2125.8 --> 2130.4
ridiculous

2127.8 --> 2132.76
I didn't though at that very young age

2130.4 --> 2135.7200000000003
and that made me like oh this

2132.76 --> 2138.2400000000002
weird what a

2135.72 --> 2141.0
weirdo like on the freaking Waldorf

2138.24 --> 2142.8799999999997
School so yeah I mean just because

2141.0 --> 2146.839
people

2142.88 --> 2148.44
are with yeah involving with Rudolph

2146.839 --> 2152.2
Seer stuff doesn't mean that they

2148.44 --> 2155.2000000000003
actually know everything about it at

2152.2 --> 2155.2
all

2155.8 --> 2160.119
anyway

2157.599 --> 2162.839
she doesn't reveal it to other people

2160.119 --> 2165.2000000000003
because they would accuse her of

2162.839 --> 2168.2
Witchcraft

2165.2 --> 2168.2
okay

2169.0 --> 2172.0
well

2172.56 --> 2176.2799999999997
what I don't see

2182.28 --> 2189.92
that I don't understand how that would

2185.04 --> 2192.96
work I mean the technique as I use it I

2189.92 --> 2195.2000000000003
literally invoke Jesus Christ and

2192.96 --> 2197.599
Archangel Michael and I don't see how

2195.2 --> 2198.7599999999998
that could be witchcraft it's like no

2197.599 --> 2202.0
it's just a

2198.76 --> 2206.119
very more specific type of

2202.0 --> 2209.24
praying and it works so I mean isn't it

2206.119 --> 2209.2400000000002
praying supposed to

2215.68 --> 2218.68
work

2219.2 --> 2225.48
she kept it secretive s right okay well

2223.119 --> 2228.52
I don't care I don't care for being

2225.48 --> 2230.119
accused like that at all I mean

2228.52 --> 2234.359
seriously come at

2230.119 --> 2238.48
me seriously like I don't [Â __Â ] care

2234.359 --> 2240.0789999999997
yeah it works it's out there it isn't

2238.48 --> 2241.96
witchcraft why don't you deal with the

2240.079 --> 2244.0
actual freaking witchcraft the people

2241.96 --> 2245.599
that are like I hate Humanity I'm going

2244.0 --> 2247.52
to

2245.599 --> 2250.599
like

2247.52 --> 2255.119
[Â __Â ] around with him or like promote

2250.599 --> 2258.0
Marxist [Â __Â ] that's witchcraft that's

2255.119 --> 2260.44
evil if people are dumb enough to be

2258.0 --> 2263.44
like medieval type

2260.44 --> 2266.7200000000003
[Â __Â ] religious about it that's their

2263.44 --> 2266.7200000000003
[Â __Â ] problem not

2271.28 --> 2274.6400000000003
mine what are you

2275.599 --> 2278.599
doing

2280.96 --> 2286.28
why did you delete that slow-mo hello

2296.52 --> 2301.0
slowo right but I mean duper it is

2298.839 --> 2302.64
generally known that people that do this

2301.0 --> 2305.72
sort of thing they do get knacked

2302.64 --> 2307.8799999999997
there's like demons come out in other

2305.72 --> 2310.48
people they fear

2307.88 --> 2311.359
which is just classical it's so typical

2310.48 --> 2314.44
how that

2311.359 --> 2317.0
happens right my healer had to basically

2314.44 --> 2320.4
like retract from the internet

2317.0 --> 2323.35
completely it's like also a reason why

2320.4 --> 2324.96
never going to like share you his name

2323.35 --> 2329.359
[Music]

2324.96 --> 2331.48
ever because like he got really like

2329.359 --> 2334.4
persecuted by some people that were just

2331.48 --> 2337.56
like we're going to destroy that guy

2334.4 --> 2339.64
okay and that even happened decades ago

2337.56 --> 2343.56
go

2339.64 --> 2347.4
cuz it just

2343.56 --> 2351.119
yeah cuz it's it's bright

2347.4 --> 2354.119
light it's dare I say closer with Christ

2351.119 --> 2355.6400000000003
and those that think that they are the

2354.119 --> 2359.359
Arbiters of

2355.64 --> 2362.1189999999997
that they get all pissy and devilish

2359.359 --> 2364.64
over it and like oh witchcraft it's just

2362.119 --> 2368.079
the Classic [Â __Â ] man it's the same crap

2364.64 --> 2370.4
all over again never changes people

2368.079 --> 2370.4
don't

2373.4 --> 2378.599
change that by accident okay no problem

2395.4 --> 2398.4
weird

2408.599 --> 2414.96
very similar to what people some people

2410.64 --> 2418.48
call sending out energy yeah well the

2414.96 --> 2420.92
technique is does that also it just gets

2418.48 --> 2420.92
more

2425.359 --> 2428.359
specific

2436.88 --> 2444.2000000000003
right and what it also does and this is

2441.04 --> 2447.48
like this is just a focus issue

2444.2 --> 2447.48
spiritually is

2448.4 --> 2455.319
that it just uses different views on

2453.48 --> 2458.319
things and

2455.319 --> 2458.319
it

2461.0 --> 2466.56
I am lost for words like how to describe

2476.16 --> 2483.7999999999997
that it's just using a slightly altered

2480.359 --> 2485.24
perspective of the spiritual cosmology

2483.8 --> 2488.8390000000004
it's just

2485.24 --> 2492.2799999999997
different but it works really

2488.839 --> 2494.839
well like when I do those things yeah

2492.28 --> 2496.1600000000003
you are dealing with the forces you are

2494.839 --> 2498.72
dealing

2496.16 --> 2502.5989999999997
like like a Christian

2498.72 --> 2504.0
would like you're opposing the devil and

2502.599 --> 2506.48
those forces the

2504.0 --> 2510.8
darkness and you're praying with the

2506.48 --> 2514.4
light and Christ I mean it is that it's

2510.8 --> 2516.96
just slightly different it's you could

2514.4 --> 2520.2400000000002
like very easily attribute and just say

2516.96 --> 2520.2400000000002
like it's a cultural

2538.36 --> 2541.559
[Music]

2545.16 --> 2548.16
difference

2563.8 --> 2567.6800000000003
right but like the primary thing that it

2566.48 --> 2571.16
really

2567.68 --> 2571.16
does hey Ric

2572.92 --> 2581.96
back is that it's much more subt

2576.88 --> 2585.079
about like entities like minor demonic

2581.96 --> 2587.079
entities that are like very prevalent in

2585.079 --> 2588.559
the world always have been but it's

2587.079 --> 2590.88
getting way worse like in these

2588.559 --> 2593.6400000000003
psychological warfare times it gets way

2590.88 --> 2597.6800000000003
worse they get stronger they more they

2593.64 --> 2600.52
try more and they see themselves in

2597.68 --> 2603.48
everybody and if you then just start to

2600.52 --> 2605.079
really consciously

2603.48 --> 2608.079
like

2605.079 --> 2611.2000000000003
exercise demons from people you could

2608.079 --> 2612.44
call it because in minor it's not like

2611.2 --> 2614.5989999999997
oh full

2612.44 --> 2616.92
position I'll eat your mother or

2614.599 --> 2618.76
something like not full possession

2616.92 --> 2622.28
that's like super theatrical which is

2618.76 --> 2625.8390000000004
like the way far end of

2622.28 --> 2627.44
it there's like more subtle tags that

2625.839 --> 2629.88
they can leave and when you start

2627.44 --> 2634.04
removing that it's like all the darkness

2629.88 --> 2638.079
just takes notice it's like hey you're

2634.04 --> 2638.079
breaking the spell here

2638.28 --> 2643.88
and that spell includes people that

2640.2 --> 2643.8799999999997
think that they are saved from all

2644.119 --> 2649.28
that when they are clearly acting out

2647.2 --> 2654.3999999999996
the

2649.28 --> 2654.4
demons and then just have to move on Etc

2658.52 --> 2664.04
right and like demons just find their

2661.839 --> 2665.7999999999997
way in a person and then just like oh

2664.04 --> 2666.7599999999998
I'm going to take up camp here like I'm

2665.8 --> 2669.8
going

2666.76 --> 2672.0
they make the person addicted to like

2669.8 --> 2674.599
some kind of power or

2672.0 --> 2677.44
authority like Spiritual Authority is

2674.599 --> 2681.1600000000003
also like a power that can be

2677.44 --> 2684.16
alluring and then like when it becomes

2681.16 --> 2686.48
threatened demons like make you do stuff

2684.16 --> 2688.8799999999997
that are like against like all the

2686.48 --> 2691.72
teaching that you supposedly

2688.88 --> 2694.599
claim

2691.72 --> 2696.7599999999998
right and hey I'm not perfect I have

2694.599 --> 2699.319
those issues too I am a aware of that

2696.76 --> 2703.2000000000003
and I'm like been working like very very

2699.319 --> 2705.839
hard on that like focusing very hard on

2703.2 --> 2708.52
that and I've managed to like come a

2705.839 --> 2708.52
long way I

2709.319 --> 2715.52
think but the the fact remains that if

2712.119 --> 2718.599
you just do that sort of thing it

2715.52 --> 2720.52
catches the iros saur basically it

2718.599 --> 2723.44
starts to see you and there's like a

2720.52 --> 2725.079
whole bunch of people in the darkness

2723.44 --> 2727.76
that are like going to come for you

2725.079 --> 2731.48
they're like

2727.76 --> 2734.079
I like this person is not allowed to be

2731.48 --> 2736.48
there and they will like call witchcraft

2734.079 --> 2738.6800000000003
on you and like people that will call

2736.48 --> 2741.92
witchcraft on you that like they don't

2738.68 --> 2746.16
necessarily even have to be Christian or

2741.92 --> 2749.2000000000003
anything like they'll just make it

2746.16 --> 2753.8799999999997
up it's just about

2749.2 --> 2756.64
oh it's scary demons get

2753.88 --> 2758.7200000000003
scared and so they have to get rid of it

2756.64 --> 2758.72
I

2760.359 --> 2768.68
mean there I say Jesus literally talked

2764.319 --> 2770.04
about that effect like how that is like

2768.68 --> 2772.839
I'm not going to quote because I don't

2770.04 --> 2775.599
know the exact quote basically the

2772.839 --> 2778.839
brighter you shine the more the demons

2775.599 --> 2778.839
will try to cast their

2779.079 --> 2784.8
Shadow and we'll try to make it dim down

2783.16 --> 2787.319
to make it

2784.8 --> 2789.96
stop

2787.319 --> 2792.839
because real bright light like wakes

2789.96 --> 2794.96
people up and then they they cast their

2792.839 --> 2797.599
demons

2794.96 --> 2798.7200000000003
off and that's a threat to those that

2797.599 --> 2800.92
don't do

2798.72 --> 2804.04
it because those that don't do it they

2800.92 --> 2806.7200000000003
will see how people are basically freed

2804.04 --> 2809.8
from the bonds that bonded them to

2806.72 --> 2812.4399999999996
another that had the same

2809.8 --> 2815.559
thing and then they'll get

2812.44 --> 2817.68
angry and they'll like start to look at

2815.559 --> 2819.4
it first world like oh no they're

2817.68 --> 2822.1189999999997
getting possessed they're getting

2819.4 --> 2824.2000000000003
Enchanted by some Demon spirit and then

2822.119 --> 2826.6400000000003
they'll call you saying you're doing

2824.2 --> 2829.64
witchcraft I

2826.64 --> 2829.64
mean

2832.119 --> 2835.7200000000003
classic it's how it

2841.88 --> 2846.76
happens yeah trigger words like

2844.119 --> 2850.119
witchcraft speaking with demons yeah I'm

2846.76 --> 2850.119
not freaking speaking with

2850.24 --> 2853.9599999999996
demons absolutely

2863.96 --> 2870.4
not yeah and I mean any Christian any

2868.119 --> 2873.4
Christian that thinks

2870.4 --> 2876.96
that anybody that's going to like

2873.4 --> 2880.2400000000002
literally verbally speak the name Jesus

2876.96 --> 2883.0
Christ like in the thing they're doing

2880.24 --> 2885.4399999999996
that you're summoning a demon then you

2883.0 --> 2887.44
literally don't even believe in the

2885.44 --> 2891.319
power of the

2887.44 --> 2894.079
name or that it's real

2891.319 --> 2897.72
like what just because I didn't do it

2894.079 --> 2900.3590000000004
your way and then it's a demon well then

2897.72 --> 2903.04
you literally have no footing because

2900.359 --> 2904.839
what if you were actually wrong well

2903.04 --> 2907.7599999999998
then by your own standards you were

2904.839 --> 2910.5589999999997
literally just doing that with the demon

2907.76 --> 2913.079
then right just flip it around it's like

2910.559 --> 2914.6400000000003
oh really you think that's possible I

2913.079 --> 2919.6800000000003
don't think it's possible I don't think

2914.64 --> 2920.5589999999997
it's possible to converse or or deal

2919.68 --> 2923.319
with

2920.559 --> 2925.7200000000003
demons when you invoke the name Jesus

2923.319 --> 2928.0
Christ I don't think that's physically

2925.72 --> 2930.799
possible or spiritually

2928.0 --> 2934.2
possible yeah I have that very strong

2930.799 --> 2936.52
belief that even somebody that might be

2934.2 --> 2938.9199999999996
delusion or have a weird thing as long

2936.52 --> 2941.4
as they just invoke that

2938.92 --> 2943.16
name like yeah they'll still do things

2941.4 --> 2945.359
wrong but I mean it's not going to go

2943.16 --> 2945.359
that

2945.52 --> 2951.92
bad or they will literally anger God and

2949.559 --> 2956.7200000000003
then be punished by God and nobody else

2951.92 --> 2956.7200000000003
has to do anything for that

2964.52 --> 2967.52
right

2969.799 --> 2972.96
I I trust in

2994.52 --> 2997.52
God

2998.839 --> 3001.119
all

3002.12 --> 3005.239
[Music]

3008.119 --> 3012.0
right right I mean to

3012.839 --> 3019.4
me anybody saying oh the technique is

3016.079 --> 3021.44
demonic to me you know how that sounds

3019.4 --> 3024.48
that sounds like a baller calling a flat

3021.44 --> 3027.44
Earth or a liar that's literally what

3024.48 --> 3027.44
that sounds like to me

3034.52 --> 3042.04
yeah it's like mostly

3038.119 --> 3042.04
projection cuz they can't handle

3044.2 --> 3049.96
it like it endangers their spiritual

3050.799 --> 3054.319
truth and then they

3054.44 --> 3057.44
project

3058.119 --> 3063.1290000000004
yeah objection

3060.03 --> 3063.1290000000004
[Music]

3073.13 --> 3076.32
[Music]

3084.359 --> 3087.359
projection

3102.119 --> 3107.599
maybe should put that in the

3104.599 --> 3107.599
title

3108.04 --> 3112.24
objection

3110.18 --> 3114.359
[Music]

3112.24 --> 3117.359
rejection

3114.359 --> 3117.359
projection

3129.64 --> 3132.64
yeah I'll do that for

3133.359 --> 3139.4
now I wonder if I get a comment again oh

3136.559 --> 3142.92
arwi is just putting like fancy words

3139.4 --> 3145.0
together they don't mean anything oh

3142.92 --> 3146.599
like yesterday oh my God because

3145.0 --> 3148.92
yesterday today's title definitely

3146.599 --> 3153.799
didn't mean anything

3148.92 --> 3153.799
right I still get these comments it's so

3154.0 --> 3159.2
ridiculous especially that they think it

3156.48 --> 3162.16
actually has any kind of

3159.2 --> 3164.799
influence like like it's going to alter

3162.16 --> 3168.44
my course or burden me that they keep

3164.799 --> 3171.2
doing that for years and then like

3168.44 --> 3174.88
aren't they just realizing like no no

3171.2 --> 3177.24
not at all it actually invigorates me a

3174.88 --> 3177.2400000000002
little

3178.359 --> 3184.44
like for me anger is like a

3187.559 --> 3193.94
motivator it's that's just how I work

3190.16 --> 3197.0389999999998
it's like a a very handy defense

3193.94 --> 3197.039
[Music]

3200.0 --> 3204.799
mechanism that's so I can just keep calm

3202.48 --> 3206.92
and keep stable and then something like

3204.799 --> 3210.88
really pisses me off I get a lot of

3206.92 --> 3210.88
energy to basically do something about

3213.559 --> 3216.559
it

3217.599 --> 3223.96
right anyway hello slick

3221.2 --> 3226.0
killer what did we have for lunch I

3223.96 --> 3230.2400000000002
didn't have anything for

3226.0 --> 3230.24
lunch I haven't had lunch

3232.839 --> 3237.16
yet I may have an Illuminati

3239.559 --> 3244.599
soon but I've only got minty thus

3246.42 --> 3251.59
[Music]

3264.079 --> 3267.079
far

3287.88 --> 3293.44
D is

3290.44 --> 3295.44
H don't call me

3293.44 --> 3297.44
thou anyway yeah I will will put

3295.44 --> 3300.119
Illuminati cuz I'm in the oven right now

3297.44 --> 3300.119
I'll be right

3324.0 --> 3327.0
back

3383.92 --> 3386.92
yeah

3413.88 --> 3416.88
for

3443.799 --> 3446.799
for

3447.0 --> 3451.64
hello carrots on fire late for lunch

3473.799 --> 3476.799
what

3520.079 --> 3524.88
are you in time today you're a little

3521.559 --> 3524.88
bit late don't don't worry about

3529.52 --> 3536.72
it been having kind of a slow start

3533.72 --> 3536.72
so

3568.079 --> 3572.2000000000003
I wonder what would happen if I drink a

3569.839 --> 3572.2
bit of

3572.52 --> 3577.2
coffee it probably wouldn't be working

3577.72 --> 3586.0789999999997
well zodia

3582.0 --> 3590.839
what I think that stuff is

3586.079 --> 3593.1600000000003
real uh well astrology is

3590.839 --> 3595.44
astrology is it

3593.16 --> 3598.52
real well there's

3595.44 --> 3598.52
real things about

3599.72 --> 3609.68
it but I mean like Rudolph Steiner

3604.4 --> 3609.6800000000003
technique does not really use that or

3623.559 --> 3626.559
anything

3636.799 --> 3640.24
and my zodiac sign is

3653.52 --> 3656.52
Aquarius

3679.16 --> 3683.44
do I follow the traditional three meals

3682.359 --> 3685.16
a day

3683.44 --> 3688.2400000000002
routine

3685.16 --> 3688.24
yeah kind of

3688.72 --> 3694.68
duper I kind of

3691.319 --> 3697.2
do so I have like Illuminati is

3694.68 --> 3699.72
basically my breakfast I don't always

3697.2 --> 3702.5989999999997
have it especially when I can't afford

3699.72 --> 3704.2799999999997
it I'll have lunch like after the show

3702.599 --> 3707.28
somewhere although sometimes that takes

3704.28 --> 3708.4
a some time before I get to it and then

3707.28 --> 3711.3190000000004
I'll have

3708.4 --> 3715.359
like

3711.319 --> 3717.279
dinner more substantial meal so so yeah

3715.359 --> 3719.68
I do kind of fall the traditional three

3717.279 --> 3722.279
meals a

3719.68 --> 3727.5989999999997
day but I have dinner late though on

3722.279 --> 3730.4
average usually like between 8 and 10:00

3727.599 --> 3734.559
sometimes even like 11 or something

3730.4 --> 3734.559
that's how it's been for for quite a

3743.359 --> 3746.359
while

3753.64 --> 3757.4
four me a day wow

3770.11 --> 3776.359
[Music]

3771.799 --> 3776.359
okay did just see Nathan Oakley going

3783.76 --> 3792.0
live yeah he's live good glad he's back

3787.88 --> 3792.0
on he's got his power fixed

3803.279 --> 3806.279
awesome

3822.52 --> 3828.079
also I'm surprised that like Firefox

3824.88 --> 3832.2000000000003
hasn't Frozen my screen on me yet

3828.079 --> 3832.2000000000003
usually starts doing that after like two

3833.279 --> 3836.279
seconds

3863.2 --> 3866.2
okay

3867.91 --> 3871.35
[Music]

3875.76 --> 3881.1800000000003
[Music]

3896.64 --> 3903.44
you couldn't wait this late for

3898.88 --> 3903.44
lunch okay well

3906.2 --> 3911.799
maybe but I mean I don't even like if

3909.2 --> 3913.7599999999998
You' got up very early then I probably

3911.799 --> 3917.68
wouldn't be able to wait that long for

3913.76 --> 3917.6800000000003
lunch either text texture

3923.079 --> 3926.079
mixture

3963.68 --> 3970.68
do I cook or eat out I never I've

3966.799 --> 3976.52
haven't eaten out in over a decade

3970.68 --> 3976.52
literally literally so no I cook

3981.68 --> 3987.839
everything and I have pretty strict or

3984.039 --> 3987.8390000000004
organic diet so that's

3991.559 --> 3994.559
requires

3994.68 --> 4001.3999999999996
yeah that requires some work every time

3997.88 --> 4001.4
but it's very well worth

4013.0 --> 4016.0
it

4031.52 --> 4036.2
has this strong will to eat out to not

4034.799 --> 4038.43
eat

4036.2 --> 4040.1189999999997
out strong

4038.43 --> 4044.279
[Music]

4040.119 --> 4045.799
will maybe well it all depends look do

4044.279 --> 4049.44
that's the whole thing if you're like

4045.799 --> 4051.64
really busy then the tendency to eat out

4049.44 --> 4054.039
is like way higher because you're going

4051.64 --> 4056.44
to be too

4054.039 --> 4058.0
busy right you're going to be too busy

4056.44 --> 4060.68
and you don't have the time and if you

4058.0 --> 4064.079
like order out then you can still like

4060.68 --> 4066.52
kind of keep going with the work in your

4064.079 --> 4068.6400000000003
head if you're like really cooking you

4066.52 --> 4072.64
have to like really put your attention

4068.64 --> 4075.5589999999997
to that or you'll mess it

4072.64 --> 4080.1189999999997
up right hey unless

4075.559 --> 4080.119
you have like a wife that cooks for

4083.839 --> 4088.119
you you like to see what you're eating

4086.279 --> 4090.64
before it's

4088.119 --> 4092.76
cooked yeah

4090.64 --> 4096.5599999999995
definitely and I mean I do eat

4092.76 --> 4098.679
Illuminati kasan that is a preap thing

4096.56 --> 4100.799
and there's some like soups I'll get

4098.679 --> 4103.88
like in a

4100.799 --> 4107.48
jar that are definitely like that's

4103.88 --> 4110.08
saves me a lot of work and it's very

4107.48 --> 4113.04
doable but like especially when it comes

4110.08 --> 4116.799
to things that have meat in them I

4113.04 --> 4119.679
really like want I just want to have as

4116.799 --> 4122.159
little processed stuff that involves

4119.679 --> 4125.159
meat like if there's meat involved I

4122.159 --> 4128.4
want it to be raw I want to buy it raw

4125.159 --> 4131.3189999999995
and then I I make the product with it

4128.4 --> 4133.239
that way you can trust it way

4131.319 --> 4137.52
better all right anyway I'm going to

4133.239 --> 4137.5199999999995
take a 2 minute break be right

4162.719 --> 4165.719
back

4262.32 --> 4264.759999999999
and I'm

4282.56 --> 4285.56
back

4287.92 --> 4294.4400000000005
Illuminati KAS but still

4290.88 --> 4294.4400000000005
hard is my

4296.12 --> 4302.5199999999995
signature yeah I mean I started doing

4300.0 --> 4305.32
that like kind of early on as just a

4302.52 --> 4308.320000000001
gimmick and then like in typical Arwin

4305.32 --> 4311.639
fashion I just never stopped doing

4308.32 --> 4315.08
it just like

4311.639 --> 4321.4800000000005
yeah I've done

4315.08 --> 4321.48
this like 1,500 times now or

4322.199 --> 4325.199
something

4325.32 --> 4331.4
yeah it's like my

4328.4 --> 4335.5199999999995
thing it's enough that a troll literally

4331.4 --> 4338.599999999999
makes a sock account about it basically

4335.52 --> 4341.4400000000005
animating the Illuminati like oh please

4338.6 --> 4343.320000000001
don't eat me and that kind of nonsense

4341.44 --> 4346.159
and he likes to hang around everywhere

4343.32 --> 4350.92
now especially

4346.159 --> 4350.92
fed and QE

4352.199 --> 4357.879999999999
so drinking tea while live on air is

4355.52 --> 4362.52
cool

4357.88 --> 4366.04
why what the hell is cool about it it I

4362.52 --> 4368.76
mean it's not cool as in oh that's like

4366.04 --> 4371.32
a thing you do with media no you

4368.76 --> 4373.76
don't yeah with normal

4371.32 --> 4375.48
media you don't do that you don't eat

4373.76 --> 4378.12
you don't drink on air unless you're

4375.48 --> 4379.4
like advertising something specifically

4378.12 --> 4381.36
whatever

4379.4 --> 4385.638999999999
product but I

4381.36 --> 4388.08
do right because I'm less professional

4385.639 --> 4391.679
if you want if you want to call it

4388.08 --> 4391.679
that I'm more

4395.88 --> 4399.4800000000005
casual and I just

4402.36 --> 4405.36
do

4406.199 --> 4410.159
when I get a good gal I can enjoy that

4410.4 --> 4417.5599999999995
too I've never had that

4414.08 --> 4419.36
though but I was raised in a family in

4417.56 --> 4423.96
which the men do the

4419.36 --> 4425.679
cooking my dad and like my and like

4423.96 --> 4428.84
after the

4425.679 --> 4432.36
divorce my mom was a disaster with it

4428.84 --> 4434.360000000001
like she did do some things but it was

4432.36 --> 4438.199
just

4434.36 --> 4438.199
like I didn't like that cooking at

4440.679 --> 4446.4400000000005
all and I learned to cook I learned to

4443.639 --> 4449.36
cook from my dad I got a lot of his

4446.44 --> 4452.919999999999
recipes that I then made my own and

4449.36 --> 4455.44
improved upon and and I'm just a cook

4452.92 --> 4458.52
like with my ex too like I do the

4455.44 --> 4460.5599999999995
cooking oh yeah like that was a thing

4458.52 --> 4462.280000000001
that like I was a better cook than her

4460.56 --> 4463.92
mom

4462.28 --> 4466.48
okay

4463.92 --> 4469.84
and that's a

4466.48 --> 4474.04
fact and so

4469.84 --> 4474.04
yeah I tend to do the

4479.96 --> 4485.8
cooking where do I buy Illuminati C well

4483.96 --> 4491.2390000000005
first off they're not actually called

4485.8 --> 4491.2390000000005
Illuminati cant in the store texture mix

4491.48 --> 4500.239
mixture what I call them or I buy them

4495.36 --> 4503.92
at the EO Plaza maybe

4500.239 --> 4506.718999999999
other organic Supermarket chains also

4503.92 --> 4506.719
have them I don't

4521.48 --> 4528.48
know let's see if they if if the name

4524.76 --> 4528.4800000000005
would translate in

4548.52 --> 4555.1990000000005
English Okay I think

4552.199 --> 4555.199
that

4555.36 --> 4560.839999999999
yeah they would be

4557.92 --> 4562.84
called in English it would be called a

4560.84 --> 4565.28
vegetable

4562.84 --> 4568.92
turnover because it's basically like a

4565.28 --> 4572.32
square that's just Boop into a triangle

4568.92 --> 4572.32
and they apparently that's called a

4573.239 --> 4579.32
turnover so that would be the technical

4576.08 --> 4582.12
name if you wanted to find it in a

4579.32 --> 4585.12
store that's English

4582.12 --> 4585.12
spoken

4586.239 --> 4591.718999999999
had plenty of results for Illuminati

4588.199 --> 4591.719
Cass and what

4591.8 --> 4598.909000000001
really

4594.77 --> 4598.909000000001
[Music]

4603.52 --> 4610.159000000001
really no but you do get the the YouTube

4612.08 --> 4615.08
channel

4619.76 --> 4626.1990000000005
that's literally those

4622.92 --> 4629.08
trolls no I think I pretty much invented

4626.199 --> 4631.48
the word Illuminati Kasa I don't think

4629.08 --> 4633.4
that ever existed in that combination

4631.48 --> 4638.08
before I started saying

4633.4 --> 4638.08
that so I created that

4639.76 --> 4645.639
concept Illuminati sounds like vegetable

4643.96 --> 4648.159
it

4645.639 --> 4653.88
does it has nothing to do I call it

4648.159 --> 4657.159
Illuminati C because is kind of triangle

4653.88 --> 4657.159000000001
shaped that's

4657.4 --> 4664.159
it app pull turn yeah yeah

4660.92 --> 4668.28
yeah right well we have that too here

4664.159 --> 4671.32
apple turnover like apple flop typical

4668.28 --> 4674.759999999999
for like uh New Year's

4671.32 --> 4677.0
Eve people get that

4674.76 --> 4679.2390000000005
and this is like that except it doesn't

4677.0 --> 4680.92
have apple in it it has like this

4679.239 --> 4685.638999999999
vegetable paste in

4680.92 --> 4685.639
it so that's what it is

4686.48 --> 4691.678999999999
AI Google stole my copy what are you

4689.719 --> 4696.32
talking about Steven

4691.679 --> 4696.32
Jarvis what do you mean stole my

4698.8 --> 4703.8
copyright no they

4701.92 --> 4707.1990000000005
didn't

4703.8 --> 4709.12
some ass just made a freaking YouTube

4707.199 --> 4713.5599999999995
account with it that is it that's the

4709.12 --> 4717.0
extent of it nobody's copyrighting that

4713.56 --> 4719.76
[Â __Â ] okay and hey if it suddenly appears

4717.0 --> 4722.8
a running joke in other cartoons and

4719.76 --> 4726.56
people do that like oh I'm Illuminati

4722.8 --> 4729.320000000001
now then you know that I had an

4726.56 --> 4731.120000000001
impact and you'll probably be the only

4729.32 --> 4733.32
ones to know because nobody else out

4731.12 --> 4735.88
there in the world will ever recognize

4733.32 --> 4740.0
that

4735.88 --> 4740.0
right so that's what it

4740.96 --> 4746.88
is hey blue P

4743.199 --> 4750.04
Evolution results have changed a little

4746.88 --> 4753.28
what do you mean results have changed a

4750.04 --> 4756.159
little I mean I know like Google search

4753.28 --> 4761.5599999999995
has changed a lot actually not a little

4756.159 --> 4761.5599999999995
a lot it's become really screwed up in

4761.84 --> 4764.84
general

4773.92 --> 4779.6
have you ever accidentally told an

4775.92 --> 4779.6
employee you won an

4787.159 --> 4790.759999999999
Illuminati that is so

4791.84 --> 4794.84
funny

4804.679 --> 4810.28
or or you mean like at the grocery store

4807.92 --> 4812.96
yeah I think I did actually call it an

4810.28 --> 4817.759999999999
Illuminati CA but rather I would start

4812.96 --> 4821.76
like do you have any illu oh wait

4817.76 --> 4823.8
vegetable paste like vegetable

4821.76 --> 4826.88
C

4823.8 --> 4829.1990000000005
yeah I I would because I do really like

4826.88 --> 4830.96
call them Illuminati songs but I mean

4829.199 --> 4833.879999999999
they're not called

4830.96 --> 4836.88
that so when I then start asking like

4833.88 --> 4839.12
hey any of this and then I start the

4836.88 --> 4841.52
sentence with Illuminati then I really

4839.12 --> 4844.8
wait they're not actually called that

4841.52 --> 4846.76
so but I think I one time just blatantly

4844.8 --> 4851.12
asked like any Illuminati C and they

4846.76 --> 4854.719
were like what uh I

4851.12 --> 4854.719
mean vegetable

4864.52 --> 4869.84
turnovers do I eat any other ult

4867.4 --> 4869.839999999999
sounding

4870.32 --> 4873.32
food

4880.4 --> 4888.159
no I never really named any other

4884.639 --> 4890.6
food like that I never gave a another

4888.159 --> 4894.36
type of meal or whatever a name like

4890.6 --> 4894.360000000001
that it's just this

4911.639 --> 4914.639
one

4931.48 --> 4936.32
is there any other occult sounding food

4934.08 --> 4939.28
El

4936.32 --> 4942.159
condo like why are you so freaking

4939.28 --> 4943.44

4942.159 --> 4945.28
illumin

like

4945.28 --> 4952.719

4995.199 --> 4999.08
processing otherwise it's like kind of

4997.159 --> 5001.48

5700.84 --> 5706.4400000000005
instead of food talks I'm call

5703.199 --> 5708.919999999999
Illuminati kasan Origins sorry I just

5706.44 --> 5708.919999999999
thought that was

5711.48 --> 5718.08
funny you always wanted to know how big

5714.719 --> 5718.08
the Flat Earth is any

5718.719 --> 5725.159
ideas um yeah I got a lot of ideas low

5722.96 --> 5725.159
as

5726.48 --> 5731.0
mile but no definitive

5736.119 --> 5743.159
certainty right we just know with

5739.199 --> 5745.879999999999
certainty that the realm that we know is

5743.159 --> 5748.719
available to us with the maps and all

5745.88 --> 5752.159000000001
that we know that is there

5748.719 --> 5755.56
absolutely but there could be

5752.159 --> 5758.879999999999
more land beneath us and there could be

5755.56 --> 5762.119000000001
more land north of us and south of

5758.88 --> 5762.119
us could

5769.52 --> 5775.040000000001
be it just especially like south of the

5772.76 --> 5775.88
Equator although there the weird thing

5775.04 --> 5779.08
is

5775.88 --> 5783.32
that for some

5779.08 --> 5783.32
reason like

5784.76 --> 5792.4800000000005
um the realm underneath is like

5788.84 --> 5795.28
Associated directly with what's beyond

5792.48 --> 5797.879999999999
Antarctica that's like a really weird

5795.28 --> 5801.679
thing that it seems to have been like

5797.88 --> 5801.679
interconnected a lot in the

5801.96 --> 5806.719
past

5803.8 --> 5808.56
right like they go to Antarctica they go

5806.719 --> 5812.56
like underneath the ice and then they

5808.56 --> 5816.320000000001
end up in like this Subterranean Realm

5812.56 --> 5820.639
that's huge according to the

5816.32 --> 5823.4
stories I was found that kind of

5820.639 --> 5826.36
weird

5823.4 --> 5828.44
like is there a land Beyond or is there

5826.36 --> 5831.5599999999995
indeed some kind of a

5828.44 --> 5832.44
barrier at some point all stacked up

5831.56 --> 5836.6
with

5832.44 --> 5836.599999999999
ice but maybe that

5837.76 --> 5843.1990000000005
barrier like underneath the ice maybe

5840.52 --> 5845.4400000000005
there are like Caverns that like move

5843.199 --> 5847.799999999999
past it like past the barrier and you

5845.44 --> 5848.839999999999
can get to like another realm layer

5847.8 --> 5852.719
beneath or

5848.84 --> 5856.6
something who knows how that works

5852.719 --> 5861.08
exactly but yeah more land I think there

5856.6 --> 5861.08
definitely is more land than we know

5863.04 --> 5869.159
about but how far that extends I have no

5865.76 --> 5873.280000000001
idea it could be that we are like the

5869.159 --> 5875.719
middle section of like basically a total

5873.28 --> 5879.32
of three times the

5875.719 --> 5881.4800000000005
realm volume that we know so that

5879.32 --> 5884.44
there's like two other Realms worth of

5881.48 --> 5890.08
continents and everything out

5884.44 --> 5893.32
there or it could be like way more like

5890.08 --> 5897.04
out of control it could be like

5893.32 --> 5897.04
32 times as

5898.84 --> 5903.96
big like beyond that realm is another

5901.92 --> 5906.159
realm and beyond that is another one who

5903.96 --> 5908.28
knows how far it stretches I don't know

5906.159 --> 5910.598999999999
it could be all those

5908.28 --> 5914.32
things right but one thing is certain

5910.599 --> 5917.32
there is definitely a limit to the total

5914.32 --> 5922.08
amount there's no unlimited

5917.32 --> 5924.88
space so unlimited land that is

5922.08 --> 5924.88
logically

5926.36 --> 5930.92
impossible unless nothing was real it's

5928.76 --> 5932.96
all just a simulation and then it's like

5930.92 --> 5936.719
oh you just move further oh then just

5932.96 --> 5939.2390000000005
whatever wherever you go that manifests

5936.719 --> 5939.2390000000005
that new

5940.239 --> 5946.299999999999
thing who

5943.159 --> 5949.759999999999
knows but I doubt

5946.3 --> 5953.08
[Music]

5949.76 --> 5955.84
it North Pole could be the center yeah I

5953.08 --> 5955.84
highly doubt

5956.679 --> 5961.599
that Earth is not a

5960.04 --> 5964.159
disc

5961.599 --> 5967.119000000001
like it's literally not a dis lower

5964.159 --> 5970.32
smile and when you take this dis map

5967.119 --> 5972.799999999999
thing that all the was used as a

5970.32 --> 5976.04
blueprint for the Flat Earth

5972.8 --> 5979.320000000001
model uh yeah it's continually

5976.04 --> 5983.56
overlooked since the start that that map

5979.32 --> 5987.36
on which that is based has inconsistent

5983.56 --> 5990.88
scales yeah it's literally not that it's

5987.36 --> 5993.28
literally not that disc and thereby you

5990.88 --> 5998.36
can can't declare the North Pole being

5993.28 --> 5998.36
at the center because it's not that

5999.199 --> 6006.48
disc there is no Center there arguably

6002.28 --> 6006.48
is no provable Center about any of

6011.239 --> 6016.598999999999
it what shape do you think it is I think

6014.4 --> 6016.598999999999
it's

6019.96 --> 6024.159
flat but I think that we're stuck

6022.599 --> 6027.8
basically in what would be described as

6024.159 --> 6031.32
a wormhole or a loop a looping space a

6027.8 --> 6032.679
limitation to the available volume

6031.32 --> 6036.239
looping in on

6032.679 --> 6039.08
itself that's what I suspect I know how

6036.239 --> 6042.48
how to be able to falsify that I just

6039.08 --> 6044.0
can't do it physically right now and

6042.48 --> 6046.119
it's very unlikely that it will happen

6044.0 --> 6047.639
in my lifetime so it will always remain

6046.119 --> 6051.08
this

6047.639 --> 6054.2390000000005
rumor that will be happily put in the at

6051.08 --> 6056.199
the side or in the trash can in favor of

6054.239 --> 6059.08
oh but at least with a disc you can make

6056.199 --> 6062.239
a model you can make a thing so people

6059.08 --> 6064.5199999999995
can actually see it and think about it

6062.239 --> 6066.36
yeah can't really do that with a

6064.52 --> 6070.280000000001
rectangular looping

6066.36 --> 6071.239
model you can 3D animate it and that's

6070.28 --> 6074.0
about

6071.239 --> 6076.04
it you can't actually physically make

6074.0 --> 6079.639
that because you can't physically make

6076.04 --> 6079.639
looping space

6079.84 --> 6082.84
see

6087.56 --> 6093.400000000001
all right but if you want to know just

6089.639 --> 6096.719
look at the title cards of my shows for

6093.4 --> 6100.199
like the last five

6096.719 --> 6104.2390000000005
years that's what it is that's what I

6100.199 --> 6106.598999999999
think how it is rectangular looping

6104.239 --> 6108.959999999999
equator would be a straight line not a

6106.599 --> 6108.96
not a

6109.48 --> 6113.718999999999
circle a loop looping what is

6112.159 --> 6117.5599999999995
that

6113.719 --> 6122.32
uh you walk in a straight line

6117.56 --> 6124.280000000001
without curving away in any form and

6122.32 --> 6127.28
then end up in the location where you

6124.28 --> 6127.28
started that's

6133.04 --> 6138.92
looping get there land Beyond do you

6135.76 --> 6142.76
think there is life there

6138.92 --> 6142.76
absolutely you can't stop

6145.199 --> 6149.32
life if there's land there's life

6147.76 --> 6152.639
there's going to be FAA and there's

6149.32 --> 6156.199
going to be Flora lots of

6152.639 --> 6159.4400000000005
it and I think that like the most

6156.199 --> 6161.759999999999
commonly to be expected thing we'd bump

6159.44 --> 6165.36
into especially in the direction of

6161.76 --> 6169.04
Antarctica and potentially Beyond is

6165.36 --> 6173.88
mammoths hary elephants pretty damn sure

6169.04 --> 6173.88
that they're there like that's even been

6176.679 --> 6183.88
said I think even like n probably not

6180.0 --> 6187.48
filmed could be but I mean mammoths yes

6183.88 --> 6187.4800000000005
I think there are mammoths

6189.76 --> 6194.2390000000005
there and obviously

6194.4 --> 6201.159
Birds I think that there are probably

6197.76 --> 6203.92
multiple bird species that we very L

6201.159 --> 6206.679
familiar with that have been migrating

6203.92 --> 6206.679
to the land

6215.96 --> 6221.4800000000005
Beyond py elephants that's funny yeah

6218.56 --> 6221.4800000000005
that's what a mammoth

6228.04 --> 6232.4
is they have a frozen mammoth in austral

6230.88 --> 6236.0
yeah well I'm sure they

6232.4 --> 6238.759999999999
do I'm also quite confident that they're

6236.0 --> 6240.679
still alive out there and breeding and

6238.76 --> 6243.679
everything unless they've been all

6240.679 --> 6247.1990000000005
hunted down or something who

6243.679 --> 6249.88
know in Siberia oh that yeah sure but I

6247.199 --> 6250.879999999999
mean mammoths have probably been all

6249.88 --> 6254.52
over the

6250.88 --> 6254.52
world some point in

6257.52 --> 6263.080000000001
history I mean when you really think

6259.76 --> 6267.280000000001
about it is a good chance that elephants

6263.08 --> 6271.44
the elephants that we know are actually

6267.28 --> 6274.119
breed from mths by people like people

6271.44 --> 6276.4
breed mammoths into elephants into being

6274.119 --> 6276.4
less

6278.32 --> 6285.32
heavy just like we we did with wild BS

6282.32 --> 6285.32
and turn them into

6285.6 --> 6289.459000000001
[Music]

6289.56 --> 6293.96
pigs where are they where are

6301.639 --> 6310.400000000001
what awesome

6304.8 --> 6310.400000000001
title that's that would make sense

6319.48 --> 6322.48
what

6359.199 --> 6363.0
naturally lost their long

6369.36 --> 6376.32
coat

6371.92 --> 6377.679
maybe I mean adaptation perhaps bux

6376.32 --> 6381.5199999999995
adbuster

6377.679 --> 6384.32
but yeah could be either

6381.52 --> 6387.040000000001
way either they were bred to be less

6384.32 --> 6390.44
hairy like happened to pigs like through

6387.04 --> 6390.44
cultivation guys it's

6393.159 --> 6398.36
cultivation or they kind of just hung

6396.56 --> 6402.52
around and it's like

6398.36 --> 6404.92
yeah we like it warm and then they just

6402.52 --> 6408.400000000001
over time over the generations just

6404.92 --> 6408.4
started to get less and less

6409.4 --> 6412.4
hair

6424.119 --> 6434.119
maybe want a thinner Co yeah

6428.239 --> 6434.119
yeah adaptation and basic natural

6435.88 --> 6442.32
selection no not really survival of the

6439.32 --> 6442.32
fittest

6442.679 --> 6445.4
I don't even think that really works

6444.28 --> 6449.28
like

6445.4 --> 6452.799999999999
that like elephants are not they're like

6449.28 --> 6454.44
really solid Community Family animals

6452.8 --> 6458.56
didn't you

6454.44 --> 6461.5199999999995
know like elephants rarely even fight

6458.56 --> 6465.119000000001
yeah there is no Evolution that doesn't

6461.52 --> 6469.320000000001
exist that's a totally debunked nonsense

6465.119 --> 6472.28
claim that shouldn't even be called a

6469.32 --> 6475.5199999999995
theory

6472.28 --> 6475.5199999999995
it's mostly just a

6476.28 --> 6482.719
fraud but adaptation is a thing and it

6480.44 --> 6485.32
doesn't have to do with natural

6482.719 --> 6488.04
selection or competition of the fittest

6485.32 --> 6488.04
even in that

6496.48 --> 6502.799999999999
sense yeah it's like adaptation is like

6500.36 --> 6505.4
a generational thing it's like you go to

6502.8 --> 6508.04
a new place you adapt you get the kids

6505.4 --> 6510.799999999999
the kids will have like will be attuned

6508.04 --> 6515.5199999999995
to the new place and like that will

6510.8 --> 6518.2390000000005
literally change their uh not genetics

6515.52 --> 6521.119000000001
their epigenetics as it is called in the

6518.239 --> 6523.799999999999
model that they use for it like they

6521.119 --> 6527.639
adapt they become literally different

6523.8 --> 6530.88
because they were conceived and growing

6527.639 --> 6533.599
in a womb in a different area as the

6530.88 --> 6536.4400000000005
parents and that literally changes the

6533.599 --> 6539.0
child that L that happens that just

6536.44 --> 6541.0
happens it happens it happens it always

6539.0 --> 6547.159
happens and that happens like in one

6541.0 --> 6547.159
generation with people like it does it

6550.52 --> 6555.400000000001
matters like the time when you're

6553.199 --> 6559.759999999999
growing in the

6555.4 --> 6562.598999999999
womb where that where the the woman is

6559.76 --> 6567.719
when that happening when it's digesting

6562.599 --> 6567.719
everything that really really

6572.8 --> 6578.400000000001
matters it's a very sensitive period

6576.28 --> 6582.599
when a woman's

6578.4 --> 6586.119
pregnant for adaptation and also like

6582.599 --> 6589.28
the like how stable the place

6586.119 --> 6592.0
is like socially there's a lot of

6589.28 --> 6595.0
aggression all those things matters

6592.0 --> 6595.0
enormously

6595.8 --> 6602.2390000000005
so my Grandad was a rock okay stepen

6614.639 --> 6619.04
jvis Ms have not changed since they left

6617.96 --> 6622.04
the

6619.04 --> 6622.04
ark

6625.32 --> 6631.4
maybe so C back up and running yeah he's

6628.36 --> 6631.4
been live for last

6649.04 --> 6652.04
hour

6671.56 --> 6674.719
oh I'm sure they'd love

6677.48 --> 6683.678999999999
it I'm not sure though if if like pastry

6681.239 --> 6686.36
and bread type things if that's good for

6683.679 --> 6686.36
Elephants

6699.52 --> 6703.84
though I'm sure they can eat it like

6702.32 --> 6706.48
they could eat a bread but I mean I

6703.84 --> 6708.679
don't think that's like good for

6706.48 --> 6712.199
them think they mostly just need

6708.679 --> 6712.1990000000005
vegetables and fruits and all all

6738.88 --> 6741.88
that

6744.8 --> 6747.320000000001
yeah not

6747.36 --> 6750.799999999999
funny and a

6768.84 --> 6771.84
lie

6776.44 --> 6782.239
water El I seen it no I don't think

6798.48 --> 6801.759999999999
so okay

6802.28 --> 6805.36
I have to trust you on

6828.76 --> 6831.76
that

6888.679 --> 6891.679
for

6909.52 --> 6913.96
spoon

6911.679 --> 6915.719
okay I've never heard of that box

6913.96 --> 6918.599
adbuster I mean it might be interesting

6915.719 --> 6921.199
I'm still watching the

6918.599 --> 6923.719
physician

Belgium spoken series and movies coming

7373.48 --> 7379.36

7376.76 --> 7382.360000000001
little Dutch there's been some movies

7379.36 --> 7382.36
especially like in the

7382.719 --> 7389.679
90s Amsterdam everybody knows that

7385.96 --> 7392.76
shitty movie they hate

7389.679 --> 7396.36
it so there have been some movies

7392.76 --> 7398.719
especially in the 20th century that were

7396.36 --> 7400.799999999999
like they had character they had their

7398.719 --> 7404.719
own

7400.8 --> 7407.8
character but these days just I don't

[Music]

8691.479 --> 8694.92

8693.399 --> 8697.399
the hell he was talking about some

8694.92 --> 8700.359
astrology

8697.399 --> 8703.039999999999
stuff or some kind of weird prayer I'm

8700.359 --> 8703.04
not going to do

8704.8 --> 8707.958999999999
[Music]

8708.479 --> 8718.88
it I do what I do it works it provably

8713.68 --> 8718.880000000001
works it progresses me

8721.16 --> 8729.359
palpably and I don't need more

8726.2 --> 8733.0
techniques like I'm still in like the

8729.359 --> 8735.479000000001
middle of developing this thing and it's

8733.0 --> 8738.279
already working great not just oh let's

8735.479 --> 8740.319
do the other some other things like no

8738.279 --> 8743.16
let's not do some other things this is

8740.319 --> 8745.88
what I do this works I'm getting better

8743.16 --> 8748.88
at it I can even apply it to other

8745.88 --> 8748.88
people

8749.08 --> 8757.279
effectively and so I will do that and I

8753.6 --> 8760.399000000001
will have my little yeah what I it feels

8757.279 --> 8764.439
to me like miracle healing and I'm not

8760.399 --> 8766.16
even doing it like that's

8764.439 --> 8767.880000000001
God

8766.16 --> 8770.319
that's

8767.88 --> 8772.64
yeah I don't even have to know what

8770.319 --> 8775.479
somebody looks like

8772.64 --> 8780.278999999999
guys

8775.479 --> 8783.039999999999
yeah d do you have any idea of like what

8780.279 --> 8785.92
that is like to experience anything like

8783.04 --> 8788.880000000001
that like that is totally magical and

8785.92 --> 8793.2
surreal to me and I'm like I'll just

8788.88 --> 8796.0
keep doing this like apparently I can do

8793.2 --> 8798.16
this yeah when I met my healer and he

8796.0 --> 8800.6
did those things with me I was just like

8798.16 --> 8804.359
this is like a magician this is

8800.6 --> 8807.12
like like a real priest that actually

8804.359 --> 8809.76
does healing and like I thought it was

8807.12 --> 8812.279
like like this is some angel in a man's

8809.76 --> 8815.6
body or something but I mean he's really

8812.279 --> 8818.52
just a man he's just done this and

8815.6 --> 8822.68
dedicated like the majority of his life

8818.52 --> 8826.24
to it and he teaches it to other people

8822.68 --> 8830.24
too like he gives like classes about it

8826.24 --> 8832.56
I to be fair I really want to join those

8830.24 --> 8834.88
classes it would also be a great

8832.56 --> 8837.92
opportunity for me to be alongside my

8834.88 --> 8841.92
dad who is literally following the those

8837.92 --> 8841.92
classes so I'm doing

8845.72 --> 8852.08
that if is very funny woodworking gy

8849.64 --> 8852.08
bear

8854.01 --> 8857.999
[Music]

8865.68 --> 8868.68
God

8870.66 --> 8875.83
[Music]

8876.8 --> 8881.96
look I'm sure what Tera does with his

8879.8 --> 8884.319
astrology based techniques he's probably

8881.96 --> 8887.24
good at it I just don't want to have

8884.319 --> 8887.24
anything to do with it

8895.64 --> 8898.64
anymore

8899.76 --> 8905.0
yeah you think you could just roll back

8901.439 --> 8907.76
in here like I can't even roll back in

8905.0 --> 8910.319
with the guys after like allowing me

8907.76 --> 8912.04
myself to be publicly

8910.319 --> 8915.88
humiliated

8912.04 --> 8918.0
okay you think I'm going to just let you

8915.88 --> 8920.479
like oh I just want to do this no how

8918.0 --> 8920.479
about you

8925.6 --> 8928.6
don't

8931.93 --> 8935.139000000001
[Music]

8944.96 --> 8948.919999999998
right if you really want you can email

8946.92 --> 8951.6
me that stuff or something I just don't

8948.92 --> 8953.2
want you in the chat and I don't want to

8951.6 --> 8958.52
be your friend I definitely don't want

8953.2 --> 8958.52
to talk a lot with you at all

8966.479 --> 8972.84
right I mean just leave it alone accept

8970.64 --> 8976.24
the

8972.84 --> 8980.12
Fate that is there and

8976.24 --> 8982.92
inevitable and move on and maybe later

8980.12 --> 8987.12
maybe later from a composition you would

8982.92 --> 8990.04
be able to just like get back in

8987.12 --> 8991.52
like without just immediately expecting

8990.04 --> 8994.160000000002
all these things and everything like

8991.52 --> 8997.12
because that's not going to happen like

8994.16 --> 8997.119999999999
ever again

8997.279 --> 9003.6
ever you have to break this off and then

9000.92 --> 9005.68
if you're still a tolerable person then

9003.6 --> 9008.800000000001
maybe at some point I'll have you back

9005.68 --> 9011.64
in and all will be forgiven if you're

9008.8 --> 9014.319
actually calm and not just immediately

9011.64 --> 9017.278999999999
doing all this [Â __Â ]

9014.319 --> 9019.039999999999
again and that's it and it will not be

9017.279 --> 9022.04
anytime

9019.04 --> 9022.04
soon

9022.12 --> 9030.04
yeah not this winter definitely not

9026.92 --> 9031.8
potentially not this spring and maybe

9030.04 --> 9034.68
never right I don't even know if you

9031.8 --> 9037.278999999999
have that in you to get back to normal

9034.68 --> 9040.92
if there even is such a thing with you

9037.279 --> 9040.92
okay so just leave it

9045.439 --> 9048.439
alone

9057.92 --> 9064.0
right yeah see you later Rich G good see

9060.399 --> 9064.0

9076.96 --> 9079.96
nothing I can do about

9100.479 --> 9105.358999999999
it yeah slick yeah if you want to talk

9103.24 --> 9108.16
to him just talk to him at fed or

9105.359 --> 9110.479000000001
something

9108.16 --> 9110.479
not

9111.08 --> 9115.72
here yeah I'm not forbidding you to talk

9113.72 --> 9120.599999999999
with him if he's just acting normal and

9115.72 --> 9120.599999999999
[Â __Â ] so I I just I am

9125.04 --> 9132.279
done yeah and I mean I'm done for a damn

9129.279 --> 9135.0
good reason too you know cuz even as he

9132.279 --> 9138.279
was doing all that trolling [Â __Â ] I was

9135.0 --> 9138.279
holding back

9141.24 --> 9147.52
I was just telling him stop this just

9143.92 --> 9149.359
stop doing this and he wouldn't stop he

9147.52 --> 9151.479000000001
would just keep going and going and

9149.359 --> 9153.640000000001
would find him in all their chats

9151.479 --> 9156.0
everywhere calling me a racist and

9153.64 --> 9159.599999999999
complaining and just never ending the

9156.0 --> 9162.8
one like that took like a [Â __Â ] week

9159.6 --> 9166.24
of nonstop trolling [Â __Â ] yeah there's no

9162.8 --> 9169.0
recovery from that and still to this day

9166.24 --> 9173.199999999999
I refuse to like mock him but I mean

9169.0 --> 9173.2
there is no recovery from

9173.359 --> 9178.640000000001
this and I don't want to mock him

9176.88 --> 9182.519999999999
because it

9178.64 --> 9182.519999999999
hurt all of that [Â __Â ]

9190.68 --> 9194.76
hurt what over it if he have gone off

9193.319 --> 9197.56
the rails I don't even know what that

9194.76 --> 9199.960000000001
means but like I don't go there anymore

9197.56 --> 9203.359
I don't go to those chats they're so

9199.96 --> 9205.599999999999
full of trolls it makes so little sense

9203.359 --> 9207.439
how the moderation even works like I

9205.6 --> 9209.640000000001
don't even understand the rules any I

9207.439 --> 9212.04
don't even want to ask how the rules are

9209.64 --> 9215.08
supposed to work in the chat anymore I'm

9212.04 --> 9215.080000000002
just not go in there

9216.52 --> 9221.279
anymore like I just I'm not going

9225.16 --> 9228.16
to

9238.84 --> 9244.2

this needs to be fixed this needs to be

9244.2 --> 9250.319000000001
fixed I made calls even when I was still

9246.24 --> 9252.319
on fed like this needs to be fixed no no

9250.319 --> 9253.399
it does not need to be fixed I just need

9252.319 --> 9257.519999999999
to

9253.399 --> 9259.8
stop letting the trolls get to me yeah

9257.52 --> 9263.12

nature like if my heart is broken or if

9560.56 --> 9567.319
there's some friendship that's collapsed

9563.16 --> 9569.8
or whatever I don't go kicking them I

9567.319 --> 9574.519999999999
don't go looking for I don't go like

9569.8 --> 9577.64
setting them on fire or like I don't it

9574.52 --> 9580.279
just hurts and then I like try to

9577.64 --> 9583.278999999999
recover from it and I I try to not make

9580.279 --> 9585.800000000001
it more ugly than it already will

9583.279 --> 9588.68
naturally be just because of break wake

9585.8 --> 9592.759999999998
up effect

9588.68 --> 9595.76
yeah I don't do anything like I don't

9592.76 --> 9601.24
hurt my AES I don't slander my axes I

9595.76 --> 9601.24
don't stalk them anything I leave them

9604.52 --> 9611.08
alone right but hey I if there are

9607.68 --> 9614.2
issues then I will talk about them but

9611.08 --> 9615.96
in a very personal context way I won't

9614.2 --> 9619.84
even talk about oh they were always

9615.96 --> 9622.759999999998
complaining about this or that like none

9619.84 --> 9624.0
of you know anything about my ex or even

9622.76 --> 9627.72
what they look

9624.0 --> 9630.56
like some very a couple of details that

9627.72 --> 9633.438999999998
are kind of

9630.56 --> 9637.6
vague

9633.439 --> 9639.0
and that's it but I might talk I've

9637.6 --> 9642.6
talked about

9639.0 --> 9645.76
her because like of what that does with

9642.6 --> 9648.84
me and like how it made me feel so right

9645.76 --> 9655.439
in that sense it is brought

9648.84 --> 9657.72
up but like no just I don't want her to

9655.439 --> 9660.6
get any kind of issues because of me

9657.72 --> 9664.24
talking about her like I don't want

9660.6 --> 9667.359
anybody that knows her to know that I'm

9664.24 --> 9667.359
talking about her at

9667.72 --> 9673.64
all unless she wants that all of a

9670.399 --> 9673.64
sudden and I highly doubt

9674.439 --> 9677.720000000001
it

9676.52 --> 9680.04
that's not I don't think that's going to

9677.72 --> 9682.72
happen I don't think she's ever going to

9680.04 --> 9686.04
have any feelings for me again this just

9682.72 --> 9687.84
that's how it went and so it's what it

9686.04 --> 9693.68
is

9687.84 --> 9699.8
and yeah I I don't talk [Â __Â ] about the

9693.68 --> 9699.800000000001
people that I had a a connection with I

9700.16 --> 9703.16
don't

9703.68 --> 9707.439
like I just don't

9713.16 --> 9716.56
right unless they were just nagging all

9715.76 --> 9719.359
the

9716.56 --> 9722.479
time and just like trying to pretend

9719.359 --> 9724.319
that we were friends because that just

9722.479 --> 9726.679999999998
suck there's been trolls that are like

9724.319 --> 9728.76
oh no we're friends no you're not my

9726.68 --> 9732.319
[Â __Â ] friend get the [Â __Â ] out of

9728.76 --> 9735.84
here right and then then I'll get angry

9732.319 --> 9738.119999999999
and I'll I'll mock it and [Â __Â ] but if we

9735.84 --> 9741.0
had a time where there was just like

9738.12 --> 9745.960000000001
interesting interaction and good

9741.0 --> 9748.08
information and like a team spirit then

9745.96 --> 9751.319
I will always honor that no matter how

9748.08 --> 9755.039999999999
wrong it goes no matter how [Â __Â ]

9751.319 --> 9758.199999999999
insane the other gu is

9755.04 --> 9761.080000000002
acting it'll never fix itself but I'll

9758.2 --> 9763.04
never like mock them or anything I don't

9761.08 --> 9766.12
want to mock

9763.04 --> 9768.640000000001
them like I don't want to mock te it at

9766.12 --> 9771.960000000001
all I don't want to it really hurt that

9768.64 --> 9775.199999999999
all that happened it was a a bitter

9771.96 --> 9775.199999999999
bitter disappointment to

9782.279 --> 9789.0
me yeah and maybe like guys said fed

9785.72 --> 9792.88
feel that about me that they're bitterly

9789.0 --> 9792.88
disappointed in how I've

9793.72 --> 9801.039999999999
been just I can't do I don't even

9797.319 --> 9805.439
know you know I don't even

9801.04 --> 9805.439
know what the [Â __Â ] I've supposedly

9805.84 --> 9811.359
done other than just leave because I

9808.72 --> 9811.358999999999
couldn't take it

9815.319 --> 9821.16
anymore yeah and I did the whole rage

9817.8 --> 9824.278999999999
stuff and that was stupid and typical

9821.16 --> 9826.72
and embarrassing and and I went back to

9824.279 --> 9828.800000000001
apologize for it three weeks later oh

9826.72 --> 9831.72
you should have gone two days well after

9828.8 --> 9835.24
two days I felt way too

9831.72 --> 9838.599999999999
uncomfortable to do that I needed to

9835.24 --> 9843.199999999999
take a lot of time yeah because I've

9838.6 --> 9845.12
been very very unentangled with fed I've

9843.2 --> 9849.08
been like a

9845.12 --> 9851.76
fanboy big time I was defending them in

9849.08 --> 9856.399
every corner in every

9851.76 --> 9859.479
situation yeah I was I've been for years

9856.399 --> 9859.479
well that doesn't work

9859.8 --> 9866.358999999999
anymore that's over and everything that

9863.399 --> 9870.96
comes with it is

9866.359 --> 9872.960000000001
over I could be on the show perhaps but

9870.96 --> 9875.039999999999
I don't think I can be like one of the

9872.96 --> 9879.278999999999
guys anymore I don't feel think that's

9875.04 --> 9882.52
in there anymore it's done

9879.279 --> 9885.68
like yeah and I'm like yeah I'm very

9882.52 --> 9887.24
sorry that that that that's transpired

9885.68 --> 9889.68
it's very

9887.24 --> 9892.84
saddening on the other hand like I

9889.68 --> 9892.84
really need my

9892.96 --> 9899.08
freedom I can't be contained in that box

9896.88 --> 9901.92
I couldn't be I couldn't be contained in

9899.08 --> 9907.2
that box being treated the way I was

9901.92 --> 9907.2
treated for any longer I couldn't do

9912.92 --> 9919.399
it yeah I'm not some cat in a box that

9916.64 --> 9920.76
you can just oh little kitty oh and just

9919.399 --> 9923.119999999999
throw me

9920.76 --> 9924.800000000001
around whenever I try to get out of the

9923.12 --> 9930.479000000001
box like

9924.8 --> 9930.479
no [Â __Â ] that not doing it

9944.08 --> 9947.08
anymore

9954.52 --> 9958.359
thermodynamics violation yeah

9956.16 --> 9961.88
woodworking going to be I mean the

9958.359 --> 9965.12
actual mechanical debate about whether

9961.88 --> 9969.679999999998
the Earth is flat or a globe was was

9965.12 --> 9974.160000000002
over years ago a decade ago

9969.68 --> 9976.319
arguably n eight years ago n eight seven

9974.16 --> 9978.399
years ago

9976.319 --> 9980.16
right we figured it out and then there

9978.399 --> 9982.519999999999
was no more doubt then instead of

9980.16 --> 9984.72
believing the Earth was flat we knew it

9982.52 --> 9988.08
was flat and

9984.72 --> 9991.72
we've clarified that knowledge even

9988.08 --> 9994.68
further in the years

9991.72 --> 9998.8
after figured out not just like how it

9994.68 --> 10000.92
is observed but also measured calculated

9998.8 --> 10004.8
and navigated

10000.92 --> 10008.0
flat the geometry itself requires the

10004.8 --> 10010.64
Earth to be flat universally all that

10008.0 --> 10013.24
it's just like it's maximum flatness it

10010.64 --> 10013.24
like it is

10013.319 --> 10019.08
absolutely irreversibly

10016.76 --> 10021.84
flat like there's nothing that can be

10019.08 --> 10024.92
done to to change

10021.84 --> 10026.84
that but the psychological warfare

10024.92 --> 10028.399
nonsense about the globe will still

10026.84 --> 10031.479
continue I mean they're now in the

10028.399 --> 10034.278999999999
middle of developing this bizarre

10031.479 --> 10037.199999999999
confessional debating nonsense there's a

10034.279 --> 10039.08
whole bunch of people that do it sound

10037.2 --> 10042.479000000001
very interesting and Technical as they

10039.08 --> 10046.96
explain how their claim doesn't

10042.479 --> 10046.96
work but then don't draw that

10047.04 --> 10055.359
conclusion it there's yeah they're just

10051.0 --> 10058.319
Wizards they're just Illusionist Wizards

10055.359 --> 10061.479000000001
and they keep doing that I don't see a

10058.319 --> 10063.479
point in in being part of that anymore

10061.479 --> 10065.56
like even trying to review that at this

10063.479 --> 10067.278999999999
point it's like yeah okay they're doing

10065.56 --> 10068.479
that and they're taking it further and

10067.279 --> 10072.68
further

10068.479 --> 10075.24
and like they're never going to get it

10072.68 --> 10078.08
they're never going to stop they're

10075.24 --> 10081.439
never even going to get less

10078.08 --> 10084.16
terrible it just get worse so what is

10081.439 --> 10087.960000000001
the point of all this like who even

10084.16 --> 10090.68
listens to that stuff only like

10087.96 --> 10092.08
fanatical Globe Believers that are like

10090.68 --> 10094.52
we want to hear more we want to hear

10092.08 --> 10097.16
more about howy Globe are even going to

10094.52 --> 10099.720000000001
list listen to that nonsense or people

10097.16 --> 10101.72
that are like really spooked by Flat

10099.72 --> 10103.72
Earth arguments are just like oh I just

10101.72 --> 10105.76
want to want to believe again want to

10103.72 --> 10108.519999999999
believe just like keep talking until I

10105.76 --> 10112.56
believe it's a globe again right that's

10108.52 --> 10112.560000000001
what that's for those

10114.479 --> 10120.84
people regular people don't watch that

10118.76 --> 10124.08
yeah

10120.84 --> 10126.279
99.9% of the people in the world don't

10124.08 --> 10127.92
watch those stupid anti Flat Earth

10126.279 --> 10132.08
videos they

10127.92 --> 10136.68
don't they find that just as annoying if

10132.08 --> 10138.76
not more annoying than flat earther

10136.68 --> 10142.76
videos yeah because at least flat

10138.76 --> 10142.76
earthers are somewhat

10148.12 --> 10153.92
human there's a good chance the average

10150.68 --> 10156.76
person will rather watch my show even

10153.92 --> 10160.88
though it can't be kind of boring a bit

10156.76 --> 10163.479
I know I'm sorry I'm not always super

10160.88 --> 10165.599999999999
entertaining a regular person would

10163.479 --> 10168.399
rather watch me and just like hey who is

10165.6 --> 10172.880000000001
this person what is he doing oh than

10168.399 --> 10177.96
just this tedious anti Flat Earth or or

10172.88 --> 10180.96
whatever and yelling and about argument

10177.96 --> 10180.96
details

10182.96 --> 10191.239
right average person do doesn't give a

10185.6 --> 10193.960000000001
[Â __Â ] about any of that it's tedious hey

10191.239 --> 10200.319
xx6 good to see

10193.96 --> 10200.319
you smoke break send you email oh

10200.64 --> 10204.319
cool okay I'll check

10213.64 --> 10216.64
that

10243.359 --> 10246.640000000001
what get it

10253.2 --> 10261.239000000001
oh he's doing that I'm sure

10256.399 --> 10265.16
wow yeah thanks so

10261.239 --> 10265.16
yeah you yeah you might be

10266.239 --> 10273.52
right

10268.96 --> 10275.88
wow yeah that's uh pretty astounding

10273.52 --> 10278.479000000001
thank you for that triple XX really

10275.88 --> 10278.479
appreciate

10280.76 --> 10287.72
that yeah and don't worry I'm not I'm

10284.439 --> 10289.52
not buying it like but it didn't even

10287.72 --> 10292.92
matter if it was like some kind of a

10289.52 --> 10292.92
setup I'm just not buying

10300.399 --> 10306.56
it it doesn't matter anymore

10303.56 --> 10306.56
right

10310.76 --> 10316.12
99% 99.9 don't even know what the globe

10313.76 --> 10316.12
claims

10316.88 --> 10322.399
are well they would guess it though

10320.319 --> 10325.96
right they would guess

10322.399 --> 10328.88
it but then not really think too

10325.96 --> 10332.64
thoroughly about the consequences of of

10328.88 --> 10332.64
those claims that seemed

10333.479 --> 10336.479
logical

10364.16 --> 10366.439
mm

10368.68 --> 10376.68
99% people learned that in school

10372.359 --> 10379.960000000001
surely well they do just forget a lot of

10376.68 --> 10379.960000000001
it and don't call me

10387.6 --> 10391.92
surely Earth is

10389.8 --> 10395.0
flat

10391.92 --> 10397.319
what what you don't know what are you

10395.0 --> 10397.319
talking

10406.84 --> 10409.84
about

10417.16 --> 10420.25
[Music]

10423.359 --> 10426.359
yeah

10458.0 --> 10463.319
you've never met a conversation with an

10460.0 --> 10463.319
average person that knew all

10463.439 --> 10468.800000000001
that but I'd say you're hanging around

10466.16 --> 10468.8
good people

10470.2 --> 10478.399000000001
then the refraction formula

10474.04 --> 10478.399000000001
what the refraction

10479.84 --> 10483.239
formula what do you

10483.279 --> 10486.279
mean

10489.76 --> 10494.04
like what does refraction have to do

10492.92 --> 10496.84
with

10494.04 --> 10500.04
anything you know that actual refraction

10496.84 --> 10501.72
the thing that is arguably existent

10500.04 --> 10504.479000000001
within

10501.72 --> 10507.319
Optics on Earth tends to like the

10504.479 --> 10510.64
Earthly conditions like it's

10507.319 --> 10516.199999999999
insignificant and negligible as in it

10510.64 --> 10516.199999999999
doesn't have any influence on anything

10516.439 --> 10522.239
so refraction formula is completely

10543.2 --> 10547.359
irrelevant

10545.8 --> 10552.0
right the only real thing that you need

10547.359 --> 10554.16
to know is like that the curved Earth is

10552.0 --> 10556.56
claimed to be a geometric obstruction

10554.16 --> 10559.279
and the

10556.56 --> 10562.039999999999
Horizon is claimed to

10559.279 --> 10564.359
be the geometric obstruction of the

10562.04 --> 10564.359
earth

10566.04 --> 10572.720000000001
curve

10567.72 --> 10576.119999999999
but if the sites what you can see

10572.72 --> 10576.119999999999
violates that geometry

10578.12 --> 10583.2
by the ground not blocking the view in

10582.359 --> 10584.800000000001
the

10583.2 --> 10587.08
distance

10584.8 --> 10589.84
sufficiently in accordance to the

10587.08 --> 10592.56
specific Earth

10589.84 --> 10596.04
curve curvature

10592.56 --> 10599.92
calculation well then that curvature

10596.04 --> 10605.640000000001
calculator is just wrong it's not curved

10599.92 --> 10608.04
in that way and thus the entire claim of

10605.64 --> 10609.88
this sphere earth and its specific

10608.04 --> 10612.880000000001
radius and the

10609.88 --> 10615.599999999999
consequential curvature and all that is

10612.88 --> 10619.96
debunked like it's not that it's not

10615.6 --> 10624.2
that Globe definitely not

10619.96 --> 10627.039999999999
so over it's it's over with Black

10624.2 --> 10629.279
Swan it's not that

10627.04 --> 10633.439
perature it's

10629.279 --> 10636.359
over refraction presupposes the radius

10633.439 --> 10639.319
yeah but that's not refraction yeah to

10636.359 --> 10643.04
even just call it refraction is

10639.319 --> 10647.519999999999
misleading because refraction is a real

10643.04 --> 10650.239000000001
thing yeah but the real

10647.52 --> 10653.640000000001
refraction is

10650.239 --> 10653.64
insignificant and

10654.88 --> 10661.319
negligable as in so little you wouldn't

10659.92 --> 10664.52
even

10661.319 --> 10667.76
notice yeah that's actual refraction in

10664.52 --> 10671.76
the real world so what they say supposed

10667.76 --> 10674.319
to justify why the geometry of sphere

10671.76 --> 10677.479
Earth is violated with observations that

10674.319 --> 10680.92
we call Black Swan they rebut that

10677.479 --> 10682.599999999999
supposedly with refraction Pak right the

10680.92 --> 10685.16
chicken

10682.6 --> 10687.12
refraction uh that's literally a

10685.16 --> 10690.76
nonsense argument

10687.12 --> 10694.92
it's terrestrial refraction which is a

10690.76 --> 10697.72
mathematical construct that pre supposes

10694.92 --> 10699.92
the radius value of Earth within the

10697.72 --> 10704.96
mathematical

10699.92 --> 10708.0
formula and the application of this

10704.96 --> 10711.08
calculus based conception known as the

10708.0 --> 10714.439
restrial refraction would also

10711.08 --> 10717.72
permanently negate the possibility of

10714.439 --> 10720.880000000001
being able to establish the radius value

10717.72 --> 10722.92
I figured that out years ago and it was

10720.88 --> 10724.479
named the arnian

10722.92 --> 10727.16
paradox

10724.479 --> 10729.88
right because

10727.16 --> 10731.56
if terrestrial

10729.88 --> 10734.759999999998
refraction

10731.56 --> 10737.72
Alters the apparent position of the

10734.76 --> 10741.52
Horizon then you can't measure the

10737.72 --> 10745.0
Horizon anymore to physically measure

10741.52 --> 10747.2
and establish the radius value that is

10745.0 --> 10750.239
presupposed within the formula you're

10747.2 --> 10752.800000000001
doing that with so it's literally a dead

10750.239 --> 10755.319
end Paradox like if terrestrial

10752.8 --> 10758.72
refraction exists

10755.319 --> 10761.96
then you can't have the radius

10758.72 --> 10764.88
value that is in that formula so it's

10761.96 --> 10768.438999999998
self- negating it's a self- negating

10764.88 --> 10772.239
paradox it requires the radius value in

10768.439 --> 10774.439
terrestrial refraction that it can't get

10772.239 --> 10778.119999999999
because the radius

10774.439 --> 10780.720000000001
value is displaced because of it so it's

10778.12 --> 10783.2
a self-defeating

10780.72 --> 10785.56
Paradox terrestrial refraction is a

10783.2 --> 10788.560000000001
self-defeating feting Paradox it's

10785.56 --> 10788.56
called the arnian

10788.8 --> 10795.438999999998
Paradox yeah if the Horizon is

10792.72 --> 10800.039999999999
displaced because of refraction then you

10795.439 --> 10804.479000000001
can't establish the radius value of ball

10800.04 --> 10808.52
Earth in order to have that radius value

10804.479 --> 10812.76
inserted into the formula of terrestrial

10808.52 --> 10815.76
refraction which is an essential part of

10812.76 --> 10815.76
it

10817.08 --> 10821.92
genius thank

10819.359 --> 10824.479000000001
you I'm very proud of figuring that went

10821.92 --> 10824.479
out very

10826.16 --> 10831.279
early like I just saw it

10828.92 --> 10834.399
happening in the day when there was just

10831.279 --> 10837.359
standing like refraction so fun yeah

10834.399 --> 10837.358999999999
Black Swan

10838.279 --> 10845.720000000001
refraction and I was like hey but isn't

10841.92 --> 10845.72
like the radius value in the

10846.8 --> 10851.679999999998
formula how are you get to how did you

10849.479 --> 10854.56
get that radius value like how did you

10851.68 --> 10857.279
get the radius value in terrestrial

10854.56 --> 10860.0
refraction when you don't know the

10857.279 --> 10862.239
radius because terrestrial refraction

10860.0 --> 10864.76
makes it seem like it's

10862.239 --> 10868.199999999999
flat so then you can't measure that

10864.76 --> 10870.92
radius anymore that is in the formula

10868.2 --> 10875.640000000001
it's it's literally self-defeating

10870.92 --> 10875.64
all right see you later duper

10882.64 --> 10886.479
they don't even know that the formula

10884.56 --> 10888.199999999999
exists as part of the ball claim but

10886.479 --> 10891.519999999999
it's not part of the ball claim with

10888.2 --> 10891.52
working gy bear that's the whole

10896.92 --> 10903.64
thing it's not it's a anti Flat Earth

10900.68 --> 10907.399
madeup construction that's not part of

10903.64 --> 10911.16
of the official ball Earth claim it

10907.399 --> 10916.239
isn't a mathematician made it

10911.16 --> 10919.76
up use the side on view orographic view

10916.239 --> 10919.76
to make his case with

10931.399 --> 10937.96
it right so

10934.72 --> 10940.84
terrestrial refraction was created to

10937.96 --> 10945.88
justify why the

10940.84 --> 10945.880000000001
Earth is flat and is measured

10949.76 --> 10956.0
flat we know the how do you know the

10952.279 --> 10958.84
radius [Â __Â ] how how do you know

10956.0 --> 10961.479
it how did you know

10958.84 --> 10965.56
that did you measure

10961.479 --> 10965.56
it how did you measure it

10966.439 --> 10973.239
how do you measure such a thing you

10969.8 --> 10975.64
know perhaps you'd like make a visual

10973.239 --> 10979.16
measurement like of the

10975.64 --> 10982.199999999999
Horizon right and and there comes the

10979.16 --> 10985.279
problem yeah just knowing the radius oh

10982.2 --> 10988.12
we just know it it's like oh we just

10985.279 --> 10992.0
know it where did you get it we just

10988.12 --> 10993.720000000001
know it oh okay just the knowledge of

10992.0 --> 10995.04
the radi just came out of nothing it

10993.72 --> 10998.0
just

10995.04 --> 11001.800000000001
appeared just one day we just knew the

10998.0 --> 11003.76
radius right one they like oh man I

11001.8 --> 11005.8
wonder really like I think this Earth

11003.76 --> 11008.56
might be a globe I wonder how big it is

11005.8 --> 11011.438999999998
and then one day you wake up it's like

11008.56 --> 11014.359
we know it we just know the radius it's

11011.439 --> 11017.359
just it just came to me and now I know

11014.359 --> 11019.319
it oh yes sure but that doesn't prove

11017.359 --> 11021.399000000001
anything though yeah you want to

11019.319 --> 11024.319
actually make some kind of

11021.399 --> 11029.199999999999
proof right you want to measure it

11024.319 --> 11029.199999999999
it the Big Bang told him

11031.93 --> 11037.76
[Music]

11034.76 --> 11037.76
right

11043.96 --> 11049.72
ridiculous invation okay I'll get the

11047.0 --> 11049.72
[Â __Â ] out of here

11052.399 --> 11057.119999999999
then

11054.6 --> 11057.12
it doesn't

11065.84 --> 11070.279
work a bunch of butt hurt trolls

11082.359 --> 11085.359
today

11093.36 --> 11097.319000000001
[Music]

11094.92 --> 11099.64
right anyway man I have gone past 3H

11097.319 --> 11101.439
hour mark I hope you all enjoyed it but

11099.64 --> 11104.439
I'm going to round out

11101.439 --> 11107.359
now thanks everyone for coming I hope

11104.439 --> 11111.6
you like this show started a bit slow

11107.359 --> 11114.76
but I mean got interesting at the end at

11111.6 --> 11116.720000000001
least the little bit of Flat Earth and

11114.76 --> 11120.56
hey I'm you're always welcome to ask

11116.72 --> 11123.72
such a thing I will like lay it out for

11120.56 --> 11125.96
you right I will do that don't worry

11123.72 --> 11128.479
like you can ask you can ask me to

11125.96 --> 11131.0
recycle old stuff at this point that's

11128.479 --> 11133.599999999999
fine just don't expect me to like do

11131.0 --> 11133.6
that all the

11133.64 --> 11139.199999999999
time but yeah it's good to go through

11136.64 --> 11141.239
these types of arguments from the past

11139.2 --> 11143.800000000001
they're still

11141.239 --> 11145.64
relevant they're still very relevant and

11143.8 --> 11147.92
they're still kind of important to

11145.64 --> 11151.358999999999
understand For The Wider context of like

11147.92 --> 11153.2
how argumentation happens like between

11151.359 --> 11156.68
Ballers and flat

11153.2 --> 11158.640000000001
earthers like there's still room for

11156.68 --> 11160.479000000001
development and there's still like room

11158.64 --> 11163.358999999999
for updates

11160.479 --> 11166.84
like a lot of flat earthers like do need

11163.359 --> 11170.04
to like update their

11166.84 --> 11172.239
argumentation been working hard on that

11170.04 --> 11176.0
override fed have they have and I've

11172.239 --> 11179.039999999999
been part of that to like try to update

11176.0 --> 11181.56
the overall argumentation that flat

11179.04 --> 11184.640000000001
earthers will give so that they don't

11181.56 --> 11186.76
get stuck into standard false

11184.64 --> 11190.399
dichotomies in which there's always a

11186.76 --> 11192.2
way out for the Ballers we don't want to

11190.399 --> 11195.64
get them that way out we want to like

11192.2 --> 11198.720000000001
take that last bit of uncertainty about

11195.64 --> 11202.08
how the Earth is flat away from

11198.72 --> 11206.239
them that was part of the mission and we

11202.08 --> 11209.12
succeeded but but the knowledge do needs

11206.239 --> 11211.84
requires to be spread around for a bit

11209.12 --> 11214.359
that people need to be reminded about it

11211.84 --> 11216.439
and so I will definitely do that I will

11214.359 --> 11219.84
share what I have learned and figured

11216.439 --> 11219.84
out on this

11219.92 --> 11226.56
show until the last

11222.68 --> 11228.319
show right anyway I am rounding out so

11226.56 --> 11230.239
thanks everyone for coming I hope you

11228.319 --> 11232.6
like this show if you did then please

11230.239 --> 11233.68
don't forget to rogans it up and if you

11232.6 --> 11235.6

flat Earth early bird number

11255.359 --> 11262.319
1880 on a Friday hope to see you all

11258.8 --> 11265.119999999999
then and until the next video keep it
