course there's still the GoFundMe lying

81.69 --> 87.6
in wait I'm still gonna have to do a

84.74 --> 91.619
winneth on for that once I'm completely

87.6 --> 95.63
better which is not there yet I do feel

91.619 --> 98.939
really well but I'm still like yeah a

95.63 --> 102.03
lot of stuff I have to cough up

98.939 --> 104.33999999999999
sometimes it's annoying but yeah I feel

102.03 --> 109.159
a lot better than I do for example two

104.34 --> 112.79
days of three days ago so today I have

109.159 --> 112.79
to Mara coffee

113.03 --> 125.1
sandwich strawberry jelly and of course

118.2 --> 129.66
tea and the weather is good right now it

125.1 --> 132.54
is was yeah it's like this and then it's

129.66 --> 136.41
a bit more cloudy but there's some Sun

132.54 --> 141.72
in between yesterday was again like this

136.41 --> 143.4
insane lightning storm and I'm kind of

141.72 --> 145.829
sorry that I didn't really get a chance

143.4 --> 151.5
to get a good recording of it because it

145.829 --> 156.75
was just so bizarre that was that a

151.5 --> 162.599
chemtrail so big but the lightning storm

156.75 --> 164.34
was above like really high above and it

162.599 --> 166.38
was just constant lightning lightning

164.34 --> 170.43
lightning but I didn't see

166.38 --> 172.79999999999998
anything hit the ground it was almost

170.43 --> 177.57
like it was all arcing back upwards

172.8 --> 182.25
again very bizarre but it kept on going

177.57 --> 184.32
like every two seconds and yeah you

182.25 --> 186.3
would I would see the lightning arcs but

184.32 --> 193.65
they would be just going back up again

186.3 --> 196.17000000000002
and it just kept on going not a lot of

193.65 --> 198.66
sound of thunder by the way even as it

196.17 --> 202.55999999999997
was going straight over it it was weird

198.66 --> 208.4
it's almost like okay this storm was out

202.56 --> 211.38
maybe this was like a dome storm I don't

208.4 --> 213.93
think if it was and there are supposed

211.38 --> 215.57999999999998
satellites up there then like balloon

213.93 --> 218.04000000000002
satellites are gonna have some trouble

215.58 --> 220.68
because of that kind of stuff if they're

218.04 --> 224.07
up there because it just seemed like the

220.68 --> 229.28
lightning sermon was keeping up there it

224.07 --> 239.97
didn't strike down to earth very weird

229.28 --> 243.81
hmm I would have loved to have a p1000

239.97 --> 247.47
and basically like said it they're in a

243.81 --> 249.48
very good angle to just show you what

247.47 --> 251.25
that storm is like because it was kind

249.48 --> 255.35999999999999
of the same storm like that the day

251.25 --> 257.19
before but it was more in the distance

255.36 --> 259.62
and there were definitely lightning

257.19 --> 264.83
strikes going down but this time it just

259.62 --> 268.16
all stayed up there all of it not just

264.83 --> 268.15999999999997
most of it

268.33 --> 276.43
so unless he was in chat it's getting

271.629 --> 279.159
active AGM love wisdom harmony

276.43 --> 280.979
he says it's nice weather out there in

279.159 --> 284.139
Iceland

280.979 --> 293.65
good to know drunken bullet for one one

284.139 --> 295.72
Shan ji even musk rough two theta join

293.65 --> 299.94899999999996
the Flat Earth connector

295.72 --> 309.569
okay sure a sleeping warrior good to see

299.949 --> 323.58000000000004
you bill G or in a Colombo flat enough

309.569 --> 323.58000000000004
yeah I had going at it right

329.05 --> 332.55
watch what clip

335.09 --> 344.45
okay no art too graphic few thing okay

338.67 --> 344.45
I'll check it out the advertisement

345.89 --> 351.2
let's try that again

354.12 --> 362.639
oh [ __ ] damn it spilled my Tamera coffee

360.199 --> 364.88
look at that neck you look at that neck

362.639 --> 364.88
snap

373.469 --> 376.279
yuck

376.84 --> 388.97999999999996
okay what kind of link is that why would

382.72 --> 397.62
why would you okay

388.98 --> 397.62
12:45 okay

404.479 --> 407.229
what

409.65 --> 425.31
were holy [ __ ] okay I get it that was

415.979 --> 429.65
freaky huh I don't know that's not

425.31 --> 437.97
orthographic view though that's just a

429.65 --> 444.59999999999997
CGI warping around it's kind of like dr.

437.97 --> 447.24
strange was it dr. strange or the you

444.6 --> 449.72900000000004
know the the famous movie with all the

447.24 --> 458.039
dreams and stuff I constantly forget the

449.729 --> 460.229
name it's so annoying I hate it when I

458.039 --> 463.59
forget forget like names that are

460.229 --> 466.83
typically you should remember Inception

463.59 --> 471.57
that's right so see it's not really

466.83 --> 473.82
earth or aphek view now art the graphic

471.57 --> 476.039
view would look very jumbly it would

473.82 --> 478.08
almost look like you would be looking

476.039 --> 481.349
like at everything almost like an

478.08 --> 485.43
inverted looking-glass everything would

481.349 --> 488.76
just be perfectly parallel and you'd see

485.43 --> 491.31
stuff moving in front and behind one

488.76 --> 496.83
another all equal sizes that's an

491.31 --> 500.25
orthographic view this is perspective

496.83 --> 505.09999999999997
but with warped world

500.25 --> 513.56
yeah with warped space basically

505.1 --> 515.63
oh okay I missed the point right yeah

513.56 --> 518.18
well I'm I'm not sure I should even be

515.63 --> 522.039
playing the sound cuz yeah usually

518.18 --> 522.039
that's the way you get strikes and [ __ ]

526.36 --> 532.75
hey hello Jessica

529.92 --> 534.77
[Music]

532.75 --> 538.31
clean up this coffee

534.77 --> 540.3199999999999
if you leave Tamara coffee out to just

538.31 --> 549.02
dry up it's gonna leave potentially

540.32 --> 557.75
horrible yellow stains right yeah thanks

549.02 --> 560.75
for showing it it's funny to know that

557.75 --> 563.99
yeah game designers would typically know

560.75 --> 567.77
that because they know the type of games

563.99 --> 570.5
and the type of views and how that

567.77 --> 574.1899999999999
affects the options and just the

570.5 --> 576.32
gameplay influence and all that so they

574.19 --> 580.37
know the difference it's like oh yeah

576.32 --> 584.36
yeah Mario view only really works in in

580.37 --> 587.3
a computer they get that of course they

584.36 --> 591.91
do I don't think they're really relating

587.3 --> 591.91
it to to the curvature calculator though

607.48 --> 619.27
okay hello PJP finals so yeah if any of

614.53 --> 629.89
you would like to come on with me I'm up

619.27 --> 633.64
for it yeah I could talk about something

629.89 --> 638.62
it's now getting really big attention

633.64 --> 641.14
and I've posted some videos for it and

638.62 --> 644.59
some news articles in the master beat

641.14 --> 647.9499999999999
yet about the new YouTube censorship

644.59 --> 651.58
wave and especially a lift of ale made a

647.95 --> 655.6
very good Viet is just his strength

651.58 --> 658.57
every time so meticulous and he went

655.6 --> 660.25
over the new policy basically of what

658.57 --> 664.1800000000001
YouTube's gonna do with the censorship

660.25 --> 666.87
and Flat Earth was among that but in a

664.18 --> 670.51
very specific context it fell under the

666.87 --> 673.57
borderline content not the offensive

670.51 --> 676.33
content necessarily but the borderline

673.57 --> 678.63
and how they would approach it is

676.33 --> 682.86
basically if you make false statements

678.63 --> 685.6
so what I will interpret that as

682.86 --> 687.34
literally the words they used and he he

685.6 --> 688.99
put that on the screen so he was

687.34 --> 691.08
basically going through the judicial

688.99 --> 695.17
text because that's how it's written

691.08 --> 697.6600000000001
what I got from it is that pretty much

695.17 --> 700.12
you can talk about this stuff but if you

697.66 --> 704.4699999999999
claim a singular truth about something

700.12 --> 704.89
and you get offended or offensive over

704.47 --> 708.6700000000001
it

704.89 --> 710.38
that's potential risk that's how they

708.67 --> 712.3299999999999
consider it and then they will tone you

710.38 --> 717.1
down if you constantly do that so

712.33 --> 719.23
they're basically gonna attack dogmas

717.1 --> 721.8100000000001
but only concerning Flat Earth of course

719.23 --> 725.35
if the Glovers get dogmatic that's gonna

721.81 --> 726.6099999999999
be fine they don't even mention that but

725.35 --> 728.77
if you're going to be dogmatic about

726.61 --> 731.49
what they consider as risky or

728.77 --> 734.3199999999999
borderline statements then they might

731.49 --> 736.48
they're not gonna block you but they

734.32 --> 740.95
will just shove you Al Gore I think I'll

736.48 --> 746.04
go rhythmically in the background so in

740.95 --> 748.96
a way that sucks but on the other hand I

746.04 --> 750.88
for myself for myself personally that's

748.96 --> 754.4200000000001
maybe yeah

750.88 --> 757.149
doable in the sense that I a con do

754.42 --> 760.8389999999999
consider myself a Cosmo genus and I

757.149 --> 763.93
don't I'm not really dogmatic about my

760.839 --> 766.9300000000001
works I can presuppose a lot of things

763.93 --> 769.66
and I'm just dynamic at it and I can put

766.93 --> 773.649
angles to it and I don't very careful

769.66 --> 775.66
with what I claim I claim I don't claim

773.649 --> 779.079
science I don't claim of this is

775.66 --> 782.11
absolute fact although a certain data

779.079 --> 785.2299999999999
can be claimed as absolute fact because

782.11 --> 790.35
it is so I'm just very careful with how

785.23 --> 793.089
I say things and that way yeah it I

790.35 --> 796.389
think I might be able to bypass it as

793.089 --> 799.48
long as I don't ya go ranting yeah as

796.389 --> 801.85
long as I don't go raging too much as it

799.48 --> 804.4590000000001
were and I try to avoid that I usually

801.85 --> 809.98
only now do it in a direct response to

804.459 --> 815.05
just horrifying behavior and yeah one on

809.98 --> 818.8000000000001
one so but yeah this is important to

815.05 --> 824.31
lick to look into that see if I can find

818.8 --> 824.31
the video and I'll repost it or is it

832.44 --> 842.649
right so post it do check it out after

840.339 --> 844.7790000000001
the show or somewhere in the day it's it

842.649 --> 847.269
could yeah you can take it as a bit

844.779 --> 851.019
long-winded but it's very well worth

847.269 --> 853.149
sitting through it so you could almost

851.019 --> 856.44
see it as homework because this is these

853.149 --> 856.44
details are important

865.279 --> 869.819
you know there are several responses you

867.869 --> 871.739
could gift it if you could be like well

869.819 --> 874.2299999999999
how dare are they and just start yelling

871.739 --> 877.9490000000001
more start blatantly breaking the rules

874.23 --> 880.0790000000001
more to rebel against it and people may

877.949 --> 883.829
actually appreciate you it for that but

880.079 --> 888.059
they will then proceed to basically do

883.829 --> 890.8389999999999
it as they say they do or you could try

888.059 --> 894.48
to sit through it and still protest it

890.839 --> 904.369
but still remain going and then at the

894.48 --> 907.109
same time we're what Oh God Jason it's

904.369 --> 918.119
yeah okay that was justified

907.109 --> 921.769
Karen be Jason such a goofball now got

918.119 --> 921.769
totally distracted this is great

929.95 --> 937.88
so yeah we could sit through it and then

933.769 --> 940.839
at the same time I'll try to outlive it

937.88 --> 943.61
because hey this crazy censorship wave

940.839 --> 946.49
is not going for long

943.61 --> 950.36
at least from this control group but

946.49 --> 953.74
then there's the risk that once there is

950.36 --> 957.26
the political issue which is even worse

953.74 --> 959.24
once they yeah once there's a real

957.26 --> 960.74
backlash and the controllers basically

959.24 --> 962.69
get punished the Google could

960.74 --> 965.14
potentially get broken up nationalize

962.69 --> 968.6300000000001
all kinds of issues including YouTube

965.14 --> 972.98
there's a risk there's a risk of this

968.63 --> 976.72
because even though the liberal machine

972.98 --> 979.3100000000001
will then be pretty much turned off and

976.72 --> 982.49
other people will then be taking the

979.31 --> 986.029
helm but they're still a pretty good

982.49 --> 989.54
chance that they will leave the

986.029 --> 993.01
censorship system for Flat Earth in

989.54 --> 995.769
place and take the others off take the

993.01 --> 998.54
like their right-wing conservative

995.769 --> 1001.0600000000001
censorship take that off but not the

998.54 --> 1003.519
flatterer there's a big chance this will

1001.06 --> 1006.31
happen once the transition happens so we

1003.519 --> 1011.5
have to reconcile that that's a big

1006.31 --> 1014.0189999999999
chance that it may happen and that yeah

1011.5 --> 1016.54
if you can't handle that if you can't

1014.019 --> 1018.97
live with that that that put that it

1016.54 --> 1021.67
won't go away again then we're gonna

1018.97 --> 1026.169
have to let diversify and basically find

1021.67 --> 1028.8999999999999
other platforms so I am looking into D

1026.169 --> 1031.0590000000002
life it turned out to be just a little

1028.9 --> 1034.049
bit more complicated than I hoped for to

1031.059 --> 1039.1299999999999
basically dual stream but I'm really

1034.049 --> 1041.26
gonna try it out yeah I didn't have

1039.13 --> 1042.73
enough I kind of wanted to try it out

1041.26 --> 1045.99
today but it turned out to be a little

1042.73 --> 1051.28
bit more complicated it's gonna take me

1045.99 --> 1053.94
the day or two or something to really

1051.28 --> 1056.92
get it done I think

1053.94 --> 1058.93
and then I might start the stream on the

1056.92 --> 1065.1100000000001
life which does not have these insane

1058.93 --> 1068.68
restrictions and who knows whatever

1065.11 --> 1071.02
other platforms I'm a branch out to as

1068.68 --> 1074.29
well cause yeah there's just a chance

1071.02 --> 1077.47
that despite my careful attitude even

1074.29 --> 1079.84
they will still maybe even four things I

1077.47 --> 1083.71
did in the past like 82 for example they

1079.84 --> 1087.31
will still just make it impossible for

1083.71 --> 1089.14
me to to continue in a sensible way

1087.31 --> 1092.59
that's still that there's still a chance

1089.14 --> 1095.5300000000002
to that and then I will be asking my

1092.59 --> 1098.77
viewers to basically okay well it's time

1095.53 --> 1101.29
to abandon ship there's yeah Aidan's

1098.77 --> 1104.08
with by that time it's probably almost

1101.29 --> 1107.6499999999999
gonna be a dead swamp with just a bunch

1104.08 --> 1109.72
of rotting trolls anyway you know it's

1107.65 --> 1111.64
gonna be totally swamped to death

1109.72 --> 1114.22
everything's gonna be still no more

1111.64 --> 1116.0500000000002
every living impulse is gonna be choked

1114.22 --> 1118.03
and it's gonna turn into a swamp and

1116.05 --> 1120.55
only the trolls will just be hanging

1118.03 --> 1123.85
around bored because there's no truth to

1120.55 --> 1128.8899999999999
a rebel against anymore no people to

1123.85 --> 1133.51
annoy it just statists so yeah by that

1128.89 --> 1137.1100000000001
time we must then go to the other

1133.51 --> 1142.78
platforms and see if there's some

1137.11 --> 1146.1999999999998
safeguard for them but who knows where

1142.78 --> 1150.61
it'll go pretty much once the current

1146.2 --> 1157.8700000000001
controls the liberal media complex once

1150.61 --> 1160.1499999999999
they are rousted for real like when they

1157.87 --> 1162.07
really lose the world grip which they do

1160.15 --> 1164.23
kind of have although they're losing it

1162.07 --> 1167.56
already what they really lose the

1164.23 --> 1170.47
majority effect really lose their power

1167.56 --> 1175.74
then we can't really predict what will

1170.47 --> 1178.74
happen because yeah because the when the

1175.74 --> 1178.74
conservative

1178.79 --> 1183.03
ambitions ones that are now in defense

1182.25 --> 1185.46
mode

1183.03 --> 1189.18
they still have plans for everything and

1185.46 --> 1191.22
they still have certain directions they

1189.18 --> 1194.48
want to go once they get back in control

1191.22 --> 1197.81
and we have to keep that in mind and

1194.48 --> 1201.3600000000001
always try that's why I always say

1197.81 --> 1203.73
diplomacy because we don't have a power

1201.36 --> 1205.9199999999998
base we just have a bunch of people that

1203.73 --> 1208.38
are free minded and yeah don't

1205.92 --> 1211.0500000000002
underestimate it but that's in the big

1208.38 --> 1216.1200000000001
grand scheme of things that's not a lot

1211.05 --> 1218.97
of power when it when things go brutal

1216.12 --> 1222.4199999999998
that's just all I'm saying so we have to

1218.97 --> 1224.7
stay diplomatic and really become in it

1222.42 --> 1226.8600000000001
yes stay in the defensive mode and don't

1224.7 --> 1229.6200000000001
expect when there's a power change that

1226.86 --> 1235.1299999999999
the new power people will then just like

1229.62 --> 1235.1299999999999
oh yeah of course Flat Earth there's a

1235.4 --> 1246.66
not convinced that's that's a viable

1239.52 --> 1248.8799999999999
hope if we're gonna take the world it's

1246.66 --> 1253.41
gonna be grassroots from all directions

1248.88 --> 1258.5100000000002
and it won't be a switch by a political

1253.41 --> 1259.3500000000001
group so don't expect that to happen all

1258.51 --> 1262.44
I'm saying

1259.35 --> 1268.1699999999998
so yeah there's my predictions for near

1262.44 --> 1270.68
future media situations let's get back

1268.17 --> 1270.68
to you guys

1283.24 --> 1289.89
to rutube true - true

1290.07 --> 1293.7
okay never heard of that

1299.85 --> 1308.53
is that a real thing oh look it's almost

1304.66 --> 1310.8100000000002
like this social media has developed and

1308.53 --> 1314.29
developed and refined and now there's

1310.81 --> 1316.86
like modules you you have to understand

1314.29 --> 1319.54
even in the program and media world

1316.86 --> 1321.49
everything has become modules and that

1319.54 --> 1323.8899999999999
makes it so incredibly efficient it

1321.49 --> 1326.95
makes it efficient with technology

1323.89 --> 1330.63
itself like fools and [ __ ] you just

1326.95 --> 1334.54
modulized everything and just start to

1330.63 --> 1336.64
like cogs put things together except for

1334.54 --> 1340.6
cogs which is more mechanical

1336.64 --> 1342.3700000000001
it's just compact modules and social

1340.6 --> 1343.81
media is much more easy to basically

1342.37 --> 1345.6699999999998
uphold so it's almost like a

1343.81 --> 1347.71
cryptocurrency effect just like the

1345.67 --> 1348.91
cryptocurrencies are basically like oh

1347.71 --> 1350.6200000000001
yeah you want to make cryptocurrency

1348.91 --> 1354.0700000000002
okay have your own personal freakin

1350.62 --> 1359.3799999999999
cryptocurrency well technically the same

1354.07 --> 1366.04
thing kind of will count for social

1359.38 --> 1368.5
media so it might not be too weird to

1366.04 --> 1372.97
conceptualize that for example in ten

1368.5 --> 1376.09
years anybody could just make a website

1372.97 --> 1379.75
have some moderate fee to uphold it all

1376.09 --> 1384.75
and then have your own freaking YouTube

1379.75 --> 1387.31
system that'll be very efficient

1384.75 --> 1389.2
compared to now because it's all gets

1387.31 --> 1392.77
more efficient and eventually everything

1389.2 --> 1395.26
is so much mod module based it could be

1392.77 --> 1398.23
very easy to just have totally

1395.26 --> 1399.97
decentralized social media you could

1398.23 --> 1404.59
just as your computer is on you just

1399.97 --> 1407.01
could do it that's something that can

1404.59 --> 1409.3899999999999
happen there's still more efficiency in

1407.01 --> 1413.41
programming worlds do not underestimate

1409.39 --> 1416.1100000000001
the hunger for independence and

1413.41 --> 1418.45
liberation from control by programmers

1416.11 --> 1420.61
by nature that was how the internet

1418.45 --> 1423.46
originally these people with that

1420.61 --> 1425.5
mindset was created but the programmers

1423.46 --> 1428.67
continue on and yes some become like

1425.5 --> 1431.5
social media autocrats and all that [ __ ]

1428.67 --> 1433.5600000000002
that's there as well but at the same

1431.5 --> 1436.3
time just the

1433.56 --> 1438.3999999999999
regular programmer that is not too

1436.3 --> 1443.11
freaking ambitious or politically driven

1438.4 --> 1447.39
a lot of them will just go on that

1443.11 --> 1451.6299999999999
old-fashioned freedom of information

1447.39 --> 1454.66
basically that idea the original

1451.63 --> 1457.3300000000002
programmer mindset and they will

1454.66 --> 1460.72
continue developing programming itself

1457.33 --> 1463.6899999999998
and this module super efficient module

1460.72 --> 1466.33
based program is gonna it's already kind

1463.69 --> 1470.38
of sprung up it will become so freakin

1466.33 --> 1472.75
efficient and amazing that eventually we

1470.38 --> 1476.97
won't even really necessarily have to be

1472.75 --> 1480.75
dependent anymore on big software

1476.97 --> 1485.41
companies are well big software maybe

1480.75 --> 1489.76
but big social media platform companies

1485.41 --> 1493.99
hubs for us to do these things just

1489.76 --> 1497.2
saying okay thank you for the super chat

1493.99 --> 1505.69
donations Xiang ji two dollars through

1497.2 --> 1509.56
tube dot dot okay it's really a thing

1505.69 --> 1518.0700000000002
all right I'll check it out through tube

1509.56 --> 1518.07
dot dot okay two dots dots

1522.49 --> 1529.14
a new doesn't recognize it

1535.65 --> 1545.18
right so whatever you put there it

1542.46 --> 1545.18
doesn't exist

1546.59 --> 1560.76
calm okay yeah that does exist

1555.03 --> 1565.1299999999999
well [ __ ] it's a real thing huh even

1560.76 --> 1565.1299999999999
looks kind of you to wish interesting

1568.86 --> 1576.12
huh

1571.28 --> 1578.45
holy [ __ ] okay I'll uh I'll bookmark

1576.12 --> 1581.79
this and I'll check it out

1578.45 --> 1582.9
it's pretty cool looks looks and it

1581.79 --> 1587.1499999999999
doesn't look bad at all

1582.9 --> 1590.0400000000002
zoom truth outcome okay what's that [ __ ]

1587.15 --> 1595.1100000000001
damn oh my god I'm gonna be drowning in

1590.04 --> 1600.36
freakin media platforms already it's

1595.11 --> 1602.79
already begun God before you know it

1600.36 --> 1605.37
if you're gonna want a media program

1602.79 --> 1608.94
it's just like when you wanted like a

1605.37 --> 1613.62
complex business you'll need a or maybe

1608.94 --> 1616.14
a lawyer and a financial a bookkeeper

1613.62 --> 1619.6799999999998
you're gonna need like a social media

1616.14 --> 1623.01
manager just to be able to keep track of

1619.68 --> 1628.79
all the freaking platforms and hey

1623.01 --> 1632.3
there's probably gonna be loads of just

1628.79 --> 1632.3
what's it gonna be

1632.34 --> 1639.3899999999999
oh yeah let's just say people around 20

1637.14 --> 1641.88
that are gonna be masters at it because

1639.39 --> 1644.1200000000001
it they were born in a world where like

1641.88 --> 1647.46
social media [ __ ] was everywhere

1644.12 --> 1655.32
there'll be potential good social media

1647.46 --> 1662.03
managers probably already are okay the

1655.32 --> 1662.03
flat earth connect or zoom truth okay

1663.07 --> 1671.6699999999998
didn't know that was a thing our book

1665.02 --> 1671.67
market as well thanks for the tip

1676.1 --> 1683.54
right well small audience big audience

1679.34 --> 1686.6599999999999
look that's all relative okay

1683.54 --> 1690.22
I remember when I first started to do my

1686.66 --> 1696.8600000000001
flat earth talks and there would be like

1690.22 --> 1698.84
- maybe six people watching life you

1696.86 --> 1700.9099999999999
know and I was like oh my god

1698.84 --> 1702.8
and somebody's actually interested in

1700.91 --> 1705.47
what I got to say although I was still

1702.8 --> 1709.22
kind of jumbling around like the tension

1705.47 --> 1711.26
was still making me kind of clunky it

1709.22 --> 1716.3
sometimes still does but rarely thank

1711.26 --> 1720.86
God and now yeah look at this 50

1716.3 --> 1724.76
watching so it's all a matter of time

1720.86 --> 1726.83
really it really is it just once these

1724.76 --> 1732.2
things get going as long as they keep on

1726.83 --> 1734.6599999999999
running it's just gonna slowly slowly

1732.2 --> 1737.0800000000002
draw in more people they're gonna branch

1734.66 --> 1740.8400000000001
out especially as old platforms become

1737.08 --> 1744.4399999999998
disintegrated or abandon everything

1740.84 --> 1749.1699999999998
especially like yeah it's just gonna be

1744.44 --> 1752.99
social media autocratic ban migrations

1749.17 --> 1755.0600000000002
migration waves and these are the types

1752.99 --> 1758.57
of migration waves you don't want to be

1755.06 --> 1760.25
able to build a wall for although yeah a

1758.57 --> 1763.73
wall against the trolls might be nice

1760.25 --> 1767.33
but that yeah we don't know yeah you're

1763.73 --> 1769.79
gonna have to like doing a is it ID

1767.33 --> 1773.6
internet identity kind of [ __ ] for that

1769.79 --> 1776.51
and that still very dangerous it brings

1773.6 --> 1782.36
all sorts of issues and potential abuses

1776.51 --> 1786.77
with it but yeah social media migration

1782.36 --> 1789.9399999999998
waves are good it's always good for for

1786.77 --> 1789.94
starting up platforms

1812.02 --> 1816.61
all right now without question pseudo

1815.38 --> 1823.93
scientific method

1816.61 --> 1825.6399999999999
yeah ads that doesn't make any sense but

1823.93 --> 1831.76
yeah the globe rules because of

1825.64 --> 1837.88
consensus that consensus is created by

1831.76 --> 1840.04
indoctrination based on the inability

1837.88 --> 1842.1100000000001
for the wider public to catch on because

1840.04 --> 1843.97
of the disinformation that have been

1842.11 --> 1847.77
handed to them and in that sense they

1843.97 --> 1850.81
have been information-wise crippled to

1847.77 --> 1854.3799999999999
see beyond the illusion that is handed

1850.81 --> 1856.96
down to them thus they fall in line it's

1854.38 --> 1858.9
the Emperor's clothing effect Emperor's

1856.96 --> 1861.82
with the Emperor without clothing

1858.9 --> 1867.25
it's peer pressure based that's exactly

1861.82 --> 1869.08
what it is it it barely even has to do

1867.25 --> 1873.51
with the information the DP information

1869.08 --> 1873.51
is just like a public puzzle given and

1873.57 --> 1879.73
with that it is like rewarded if you

1877.09 --> 1882.9099999999999
know the puzzle really well then you are

1879.73 --> 1885.94
respected supposedly but that's also an

1882.91 --> 1887.77
active cause behind closed doors they

1885.94 --> 1894.52
probably laugh at you for being a nerd

1887.77 --> 1896.67
or in a fool and that's how they uphold

1894.52 --> 1896.67
it

1904.09 --> 1911.23
appear pressure-based priesthood

1908.55 --> 1918.52
dominating through information control

1911.23 --> 1922.45
and indoctrination with lies yeah I'd

1918.52 --> 1925.59
love to back it up just sit around and

1922.45 --> 1925.5900000000001
wait for 20 years

1937.63 --> 1954.3700000000001
if you're still around then well if you

1950.98 --> 1958.78
don't realize that the body of signs and

1954.37 --> 1961.03
the globe machinations and the model all

1958.78 --> 1965.049
the issues with it and all the the

1961.03 --> 1967.51
doctoring you do as you go trying to

1965.049 --> 1969.789
find the answer trying to find the seal

1967.51 --> 1978.22
the solution to these issues

1969.789 --> 1980.85
she bump into you know that's you don't

1978.22 --> 1980.8500000000001
realize it

1990.13 --> 1995.72
you're claiming you got the truth even

1993.559 --> 2000.36
though you're still working through on a

1995.72 --> 2006.73
daily basis trying to fix it or

2000.36 --> 2012.01
discourage actual proceeding with

2006.73 --> 2014.169
figuring it out for real because of the

2012.01 --> 2016.12
dangers that will be revealed namely

2014.169 --> 2021.94
that it's all [ __ ] and you feel that

2016.12 --> 2026.08
intuitively otherwise yeah you would

2021.94 --> 2028.24
embrace any criticism that's easy the

2026.08 --> 2030.76
thing is about being right being

2028.24 --> 2033.46
actually factually right about things

2030.76 --> 2037.21
even if you're not entirely sure about

2033.46 --> 2039.49
it yet as you go and as you are honest

2037.21 --> 2041.95
with everything it reflects that insight

2039.49 --> 2043.799
upon everything that happens then you

2041.95 --> 2046.929
embrace criticism and you'll embrace

2043.799 --> 2049.629
people that'll oppose that theory and

2046.929 --> 2051.94
criticize it and then you'll learn from

2049.629 --> 2056.56
it and it'll be either reinforced by

2051.94 --> 2061.56
what you've been through as you consider

2056.56 --> 2064.21
it or you'll notice like okay this the

2061.56 --> 2067.599
possibility becomes more remote or it's

2064.21 --> 2070.06
just no it's no longer possible that

2067.599 --> 2073.54
that's the case and that's how you come

2070.06 --> 2077.29
to find the truth in your journey but

2073.54 --> 2080.2599999999998
that's not what you guys do you have a

2077.29 --> 2083.05
preset and result that you're working

2080.26 --> 2087.849
towards and that is always there you

2083.05 --> 2088.6290000000004
have an ideal idealism a dream of how it

2087.849 --> 2091.48
must be

2088.629 --> 2097.27
and you're handed down instructions of

2091.48 --> 2100.75
how it must be how to work two words

2097.27 --> 2105.369
sealing the evidence for how it must be

2100.75 --> 2107.65
and then you go to work for that but

2105.369 --> 2110.23
you're not you're working against you're

2107.65 --> 2114.58
working towards the ideal of the globe

2110.23 --> 2118.119
and of making it all explained that it

2114.58 --> 2120.91
is a globe rather that you're then that

2118.119 --> 2123.4300000000003
you're literally working with the tools

2120.91 --> 2127.0299999999997
that are around and

2123.43 --> 2127.0299999999997
that's the difference

2132.35 --> 2135.54
[Music]

2138.5 --> 2146.599
yeah it's a funny here funny coincidence

2143.75 --> 2152.74
isn't it Jorn op Tao

2146.599 --> 2152.7400000000002
well it is a religion

2157.859 --> 2164.7
it's a religion in denial it's it's 180

2161.999 --> 2169.709
degrees with a lot of things it's the

2164.7 --> 2173.3089999999997
nature of it and denial of itself being

2169.709 --> 2177.41
and conducting itself like a religion is

2173.309 --> 2183.8900000000003
part of it it's taken as absolute truth

2177.41 --> 2186.239
it's it would be like modern-day

2183.89 --> 2188.459
Christianity in a Western world which is

2186.239 --> 2192.229
relatively tame it is really tame

2188.459 --> 2194.7889999999998
actually it's almost cooking ly tame but

2192.229 --> 2198.5389999999998
just consider it that they would say

2194.789 --> 2202.4990000000003
this everything in this book is absolute

2198.539 --> 2205.559
truth and if you deny that then you're

2202.499 --> 2209.459
insane and you should be locked up in a

2205.559 --> 2212.989
mental institute or just like talked

2209.459 --> 2215.3089999999997
down to like and try to break you if

2212.989 --> 2217.859
Christianity would be like that then it

2215.309 --> 2221.219
would be very close in this religious

2217.859 --> 2224.3089999999997
format to what the globe religion is

2221.219 --> 2226.349
like but they took it out because in the

2224.309 --> 2230.099
Bible it actually says not to do that

2226.349 --> 2233.1600000000003
and it's kind of like very hard to

2230.099 --> 2234.989
misinterpret that people come in

2233.16 --> 2240.3289999999997
Christianity have come to an agreement

2234.989 --> 2242.2490000000003
to that despite whatever the real powers

2240.329 --> 2245.299
of those churches and everything are

2242.249 --> 2248.9689999999996
doing that's another matter entirely

2245.299 --> 2251.43
but yeah the globe religion that the

2248.969 --> 2257.7490000000003
people that wield that the priesthood of

2251.43 --> 2262.1989999999996
it they're they're not they're actually

2257.749 --> 2265.9489999999996
encouraging power tactics and they

2262.199 --> 2271.289
assume righteousness they assume the

2265.949 --> 2273.359
truth they declare it we are right and

2271.289 --> 2275.15
if you're not agreeing with us you're an

2273.359 --> 2280.109
idiot

2275.15 --> 2287.299
makes it a pretty hostile religion

2280.109 --> 2287.299
really for very patronizing in nature

2291.819 --> 2301.94
so yeah like probably the globus that

2299.93 --> 2305.39
sometimes come to visit are now all

2301.94 --> 2307.369
called volsung with pain after hearing

2305.39 --> 2310.1189999999997
out that or or they now decided that

2307.369 --> 2310.119
they hate me

2311.109 --> 2317.18
or maybe they just tune out and just

2313.94 --> 2319.039
started to for some reason do something

2317.18 --> 2322.25
else for a moment and just get back when

2319.039 --> 2324.7000000000003
the feeling slightly different that's

2322.25 --> 2324.7
how that works

2327.25 --> 2332.27
yeah yeah

2329.03 --> 2336.25
Jorn opt out the religion is hostile in

2332.27 --> 2340.67
nature those that follow the religion

2336.25 --> 2345.039
when actually engaging become mentally

2340.67 --> 2351.14
hostile manipulative distracting

2345.039 --> 2354.6090000000004
doublethink liars and peer pressure

2351.14 --> 2357.6189999999997
exerting up to the threatening levels

2354.609 --> 2362.299
sometimes depending on whether yeah

2357.619 --> 2366.529
whatever is in them and Nathan does not

2362.299 --> 2370.46
do that with the Flat Earth he does do

2366.529 --> 2374.299
it with science and factual details that

2370.46 --> 2378.89
but it's not a religion it's just being

2374.299 --> 2383.299
very strict very very brutally strict

2378.89 --> 2385.069
with facts and sometimes really getting

2383.299 --> 2389.299
so impatient that he gets kind of like

2385.069 --> 2392.0
an ass about it but that's not part of

2389.299 --> 2394.839
the religion and especially not Flat

2392.0 --> 2397.73
Earth the worst flat-earthers do and

2394.839 --> 2401.029
that's not all of them some specifically

2397.73 --> 2402.71
don't but what their worst about flat

2401.029 --> 2406.069
earth that could be considered religious

2402.71 --> 2407.96
is a tendency to dogmatism and just

2406.069 --> 2411.079
sticking to certain sayings and then

2407.96 --> 2414.17
just repeating them as fact without

2411.079 --> 2416.9900000000002
expanding upon it without attaining

2414.17 --> 2420.039
further oversight but that's a human

2416.99 --> 2420.0389999999998
problem in general

2424.33 --> 2429.34
and of course behavioral problems but

2426.46 --> 2436.3
that's also human in general it doesn't

2429.34 --> 2439.05
characterize flat earth movement Flat

2436.3 --> 2443.17
Earth belief one thing that does kind of

2439.05 --> 2446.8
characterize Flat Earth movement is in

2443.17 --> 2448.9
fighting is more harsh hardcore in

2446.8 --> 2452.29
fighting tendencies that is something

2448.9 --> 2454.48
weird about it but maybe that could be a

2452.29 --> 2456.61
pecking order effect because we are

2454.48 --> 2459.4900000000002
mentally assaulted constantly we are

2456.61 --> 2461.83
opposing society then the stress goes up

2459.49 --> 2464.0499999999997
and you kind of in in yeah when the

2461.83 --> 2467.14
stress goes high enough it's like rats

2464.05 --> 2470.4700000000003
in a cage you find a black sheep you

2467.14 --> 2472.54
find a ya the pecking order sets in and

2470.47 --> 2474.85
you just start to attack somebody to get

2472.54 --> 2476.56
rid of the stress so maybe that's the

2474.85 --> 2482.44
effect that causes the infighting

2476.56 --> 2485.23
constantly just the pressure or the

2482.44 --> 2488.41
other way around people that are

2485.23 --> 2491.44
addicted to fighting could also at the

2488.41 --> 2494.08
same time be drawn to Flat Earth things

2491.44 --> 2498.36
not because of the subject but because

2494.08 --> 2501.7599999999998
of the infighting and then go with that

2498.36 --> 2504.82
and maybe even develop some knowledge in

2501.76 --> 2507.36
the way but yeah that all depends on the

2504.82 --> 2507.36
individual

2510.549 --> 2513.9
hello chocolate Sain

2515.66 --> 2518.81

2618.09 --> 2626.1600000000003
oh really John opt-out can you give some

2621.21 --> 2629.28
specific examples cause outright

2626.16 --> 2631.8199999999997
claiming popular people even flatter

2629.28 --> 2634.94
thing very toxic and manipulate

2631.82 --> 2642.21
manipulative that's quite a claim

2634.94 --> 2645.29
without being very specific it almost

2642.21 --> 2649.67
sounds like over generalized slander

2645.29 --> 2654.99
this is a familiar symptom among baller

2649.67 --> 2656.88
religious fanatics you're heard in

2654.99 --> 2660.1499999999996
Jose's all the time when the panel's

generalized slander listen to Nathan

references why Nathan supposedly is a

2724.7 --> 2730.759
sociopath and it better be a good piece

2727.43 --> 2737.3289999999997
of evidence because if it's not I'm

2822.39 --> 2831.66
book can be okay so tell me how that is

2827.16 --> 2834.2999999999997
not an attack hey look you know when you

2831.66 --> 2837.8999999999996
literally like make a movie of taking a

2834.3 --> 2842.34
dump and then you put a black box over

2837.9 --> 2848.64
it that's still you taking a dump okay

2842.34 --> 2856.98
so don't do that don't be an [ __ ]

2848.64 --> 2859.109
please yeah yeah Arina Columbo I don't

2856.98 --> 2860.4900000000002
need to be compared to other people in

2859.109 --> 2864.18
order to make me feel better

2860.49 --> 2867.359
okay everybody has their own upsides and

2864.18 --> 2870.72
downsides Nathan is very good at certain

2867.359 --> 2873.119
things which I am not that good at and I

2870.72 --> 2876.18
am certainly confident about the things

2873.119 --> 2878.31
that I can do and that he is not very

2876.18 --> 2881.6699999999996
capable of and we've discussed this and

2878.31 --> 2885.99
even as colleagues are open about it and

2881.67 --> 2888.69
we have a certain understanding and also

2885.99 --> 2890.7
a certain social chemistry which tends

2888.69 --> 2893.04
to be me getting really cheeky and he

2890.7 --> 2897.2999999999997
yelling at me for some reason I don't

2893.04 --> 2900.119
know it does annoy me but in a weird

2897.3 --> 2904.25
sense I'm kind of used to it because my

2900.119 --> 2904.25
brother used to do the same [ __ ] to me I

2904.79 --> 2909.119
would annoy him and be cheeky all the

2907.53 --> 2914.369
time and then he would get a bit of

2909.119 --> 2917.4
authority Rhian with me but yeah I don't

2914.369 --> 2921.089
know I look as long as he doesn't try to

2917.4 --> 2924.03
deceive people about me and what I stand

2921.089 --> 2928.619
for look I can def I admit I can be

2924.03 --> 2934.23
annoying but I'm not deceptive and I'm

2928.619 --> 2936.2400000000002
not wrong and when I do turn out to be

2934.23 --> 2938.609
wrong or I've said something incorrect

2936.24 --> 2943.8799999999997
I'll correct it the right way I'd never

2938.609 --> 2943.88
stick to a mistake so

2947.73 --> 2951.48
it's just yeah

2953.93 --> 2957.0499999999997
[Music]

2957.27 --> 2959.45
and

2959.609 --> 2965.819
I just always get this feeling you know

2962.069 --> 2968.88
when people do this you are visitors on

2965.819 --> 2971.91
this channel and then you say oh he's so

2968.88 --> 2974.9300000000003
bad it's terrible why do you go there

2971.91 --> 2977.219
then why do you keep on coming there

2974.93 --> 2979.319
because she just loved to hate him so

2977.219 --> 2986.089
much is that it isn't that really

2979.319 --> 2988.95
pathetic seriously it's like almost

2986.089 --> 2992.219
fetish like it's like pathetic if you do

2988.95 --> 2994.89
that if you really hate him judge him to

2992.219 --> 2996.66
be stupid or bad why do you go to this

2994.89 --> 2999.359
freakin channel and hang around and just

2996.66 --> 3001.8489999999997
[ __ ] all over things or like be oh

2999.359 --> 3003.68
that's so terrible oh my god I'm so much

3001.849 --> 3008.739
better than him because oh you just did

3003.68 --> 3008.739
that so terrible what's wrong with you

3012.2 --> 3018.6899999999996
no I will go there I will absolutely go

3015.66 --> 3021.98
there look at you look at you look at

3018.69 --> 3027.78
what you're doing if he's so terrible

3021.98 --> 3030.78
and why do you go watch him it just

3027.78 --> 3032.76
makes no sense to me you know when I get

3030.78 --> 3038.13
sick of people and I do sometimes

3032.76 --> 3041.67
channels I stop watching them but then

3038.13 --> 3045.2400000000002
again I am very tolerant so people like

3041.67 --> 3047.67
Alex Jones which definitely do certain

3045.24 --> 3050.64
things sometimes that do not yet me or

3047.67 --> 3053.1800000000003
that I absolutely adamantly disagree

3050.64 --> 3056.43
with although that doesn't happen a lot

3053.18 --> 3060.5099999999998
really the nauseating part a little bit

3056.43 --> 3066.7799999999997
more but the disagree anot so vividly

3060.51 --> 3070.8
I still watch him because he still has

3066.78 --> 3073.7900000000004
stuff that I kind of want to see that I

3070.8 --> 3077.52
feel I need to see doesn't make him a

3073.79 --> 3081.0299999999997
specific great person though just means

3077.52 --> 3085.04
that he has their things to offer things

3081.03 --> 3087.5400000000004
he does that interest me it's different

3085.04 --> 3089.61
so I'm not gonna be [ __ ] all day oh

3087.54 --> 3092.25
my god Alex Jones is such a stupid

3089.61 --> 3093.9
glower he's such a stupid Globo his

3092.25 --> 3096.32
talkie all no look he has a new

3093.9 --> 3099.33
advertisement who is basically over the

3096.32 --> 3101.5800000000004
space and the future and oh my god we

3099.33 --> 3104.43
gotta save the species against the

3101.58 --> 3107.8199999999997
globalist so we can then finally move on

3104.43 --> 3109.5299999999997
and get to moon bases and go to the

3107.82 --> 3112.13
stars are all uality

3109.53 --> 3118.5
that [ __ ] yeah it is kind of annoying

3112.13 --> 3121.98
but am I gonna get upset about that all

3118.5 --> 3123.3
day complain about that all day I'm not

3121.98 --> 3127.05
a loser

3123.3 --> 3128.94
I'm not a negative idiot that's just

3127.05 --> 3133.55
gonna do that all day it's just I don't

3128.94 --> 3137.07
get why people do that why they allow to

3133.55 --> 3140.07
let something attached touch them

3137.07 --> 3143.67
negative and then like a like a tentacle

3140.07 --> 3145.11
drag them down into the mud where you

3143.67 --> 3149.4900000000002
then learn how to move

3145.11 --> 3152.19
over in the month why do you do that why

3149.49 --> 3154.89
do you allow yourself to do that it's a

3152.19 --> 3158.13
seduction it's a seduction by the dark

3154.89 --> 3161.7
forces and you step in it immediately

3158.13 --> 3163.44
and we're taught to do this like

3161.7 --> 3166.1099999999997
nobodies when you're growing up

3163.44 --> 3167.76
surrounded by swamp and nobody tells you

3166.11 --> 3169.6800000000003
not to step in the swamp

3167.76 --> 3176.28
everybody's gonna be stepping in the

3169.68 --> 3183.0899999999997
swamp but yeah you need to wake up get

3176.28 --> 3188.4900000000002
sensible and not step in the swamp don't

3183.09 --> 3190.2000000000003
do that and if you want to step in the

3188.49 --> 3194.7
swamp because you think you may be so

3190.2 --> 3196.56
able to dig something up useful then be

3194.7 --> 3200.37
wise and do you realize that it is a

3196.56 --> 3205.44
swamp get some precautions don't get

3200.37 --> 3209.3599999999997
stuck in the swamp it's not that

3205.44 --> 3209.36
difficult guys and girls

3220.45 --> 3224.98
and hey if you're gonna wander deep deep

3223.03 --> 3229.84
into the swamp and you got boots and you

3224.98 --> 3232.3
got stick with you check depth it still

3229.84 --> 3234.1000000000004
might be wise despite all of that to

3232.3 --> 3237.5800000000004
have a backup guy at the edge of the

3234.1 --> 3239.68
swamp and maybe put a rope around you so

3237.58 --> 3242.0699999999997
if you suddenly slip or something and

3239.68 --> 3244.48
you sink you could still be pulled out

3242.07 --> 3246.34
you got to take your precautions when

3244.48 --> 3249.09
you get into a swamp you got to take

3246.34 --> 3249.09
preparations

3255.35 --> 3262.0699999999997
now but or Enoch or bumble I'm talking

3259.55 --> 3264.26
to sensible people I kind of expect

3262.07 --> 3267.17
sensible people that are really willing

3264.26 --> 3268.78
to engage and itself improve that those

3267.17 --> 3271.48
are the types of individuals that

3268.78 --> 3274.5800000000004
hopefully are drawn to my channel and

3271.48 --> 3276.7400000000002
yeah there's people that will like to

3274.58 --> 3278.81
watch a car wash you know what they are

3276.74 --> 3280.5499999999997
that's not people that are inquisitive

3278.81 --> 3282.92
and that's not people that want to learn

3280.55 --> 3289.27
that's people that are spectators that

3282.92 --> 3292.52
just want to sit just like the TV people

3289.27 --> 3296.12
remember those when TV was still very

3292.52 --> 3298.43
predominant that's that well that's not

3296.12 --> 3301.43
the people that matter because they

3298.43 --> 3303.8599999999997
don't decide on anything and you don't

3301.43 --> 3306.3799999999997
know what's gonna stick to them and if

3303.86 --> 3309.8900000000003
it's even gonna result in anything

3306.38 --> 3312.38
eventually so those are not people that

3309.89 --> 3317.41
we need to be putting our attention to

3312.38 --> 3317.4100000000003
at all you know

3321.92 --> 3334.099
you can't turn yeah you can't teach a

3324.68 --> 3337.089
sheep how to hunt the best you can do is

3334.099 --> 3341.349
train it to find certain types of food

3337.089 --> 3341.349
it's the best you can get out of it

3343.7 --> 3353.1
all right well human nature you know the

3348.6 --> 3355.92
thing about human nature is you can let

3353.1 --> 3361.62
it rule you you can let it ruin you

3355.92 --> 3366.06
or you can learn to tape it and get it

3361.62 --> 3366.99
in line like a horse your consciousness

3366.06 --> 3371.61
is the rider

3366.99 --> 3374.1299999999997
and your nature is the horse you got to

3371.61 --> 3378.33
learn to tape it in order to get

3374.13 --> 3382.05
somewhere with it otherwise you're just

3378.33 --> 3392.0699999999997
gonna be waiting to see what the horse

3382.05 --> 3394.05
is gonna be doing next you know yes yes

3392.07 --> 3399.1200000000003
I do get that you're agreeing with me or

3394.05 --> 3404.1200000000003
Annika one boy I'm just expanding upon

3399.12 --> 3404.12
my point using the momentum

3414.19 --> 3421.81
you know the truth it's not just nasty

3417.86 --> 3427.4900000000002
again it's polarized it's a mixed bag

3421.81 --> 3432.0099999999998
it's the worst and the best and a lot a

3427.49 --> 3432.0099999999998
lot lot lots of average

3439.15 --> 3449.73
