literally last five minutes a whole

99.2 --> 103.92
bunch of

100.079 --> 107.03999999999999
buckets of water came out of the sky

103.92 --> 110.32000000000001
seem to have passed

107.04 --> 111.84
over the wet spot seat has have passed

110.32 --> 115.83999999999999
over

111.84 --> 115.84
it's thundering out there

116.799 --> 123.759
lightning actually struck pretty close

120.399 --> 123.759
thundering all over the place

126.079 --> 130.399
so yeah it's a weird day because it's

128.479 --> 132.959
very warm

130.399 --> 134.959
and but it's also very moist it's really

132.959 --> 143.12
good today has this weird tropical

134.959 --> 145.92000000000002
feeling to it

143.12 --> 145.92000000000002
right so

150.239 --> 157.84
it's sunday the 9th of

154.0 --> 157.84
may 2021

159.599 --> 164.79999999999998
and yeah show 888 special number

167.04 --> 171.84
hello clutch bear first in chat indeed

176.16 --> 179.68
it's probably gonna be some thunder in

177.92 --> 182.83999999999997
the background

179.68 --> 185.36
i'm thinking maybe i should change the

182.84 --> 189.12
background

185.36 --> 189.12
do more fitting type of sound

196.879 --> 200.239
let's see if this is gonna work

203.44 --> 208.07999999999998
so that's thunder sound in the

205.519 --> 208.08
background

210.84 --> 213.84
uh

217.12 --> 223.04
little cameron kamikaze gilmore

220.799 --> 225.04000000000002
gloomy day over there well not really

223.04 --> 227.12
gloomy

225.04 --> 229.28
it's just kind of a tropical day so it's

227.12 --> 231.59900000000002
not

229.28 --> 235.439
there's still plenty of daylight going

231.599 --> 235.439
on and it's really nice and warm so

236.0 --> 241.28
but yeah there's some thunder sounds out

238.84 --> 243.68
there

241.28 --> 243.68
anyway

246.48 --> 252.84
so yeah yesterday great day

249.76 --> 255.84
even though i felt kind of sick

252.84 --> 255.84
yesterday

256.56 --> 260.56
like especially in the morning i really

258.72 --> 264.96000000000004
was kind of out of focus

260.56 --> 268.0
my show not the best i've ever done

264.96 --> 270.08
but later in the day

268.0 --> 271.759
there was a ball busters and it was on

270.08 --> 274.88
there and

271.759 --> 278.08000000000004
did just fine but the entire day

274.88 --> 280.4
i had was pretty much focusing on trying

278.08 --> 284.32
to get myself

280.4 --> 284.32
healed because i did kind of feel sick

284.96 --> 290.63899999999995
and it wasn't the only one friend in

286.88 --> 292.71999999999997
emme apparently also had that

290.639 --> 293.759
so it was probably due to the weather

292.72 --> 299.28000000000003
change like she

293.759 --> 299.28000000000003
immediately inserted that and i agree

299.84 --> 302.79999999999995
it had called her on the phone this

301.44 --> 304.71999999999997
morning she called me up because she

302.8 --> 306.0
tried to call me up during ball busters

304.72 --> 311.84000000000003
yesterday and

306.0 --> 311.84
yet that just didn't work

320.0 --> 325.84
right so

326.479 --> 332.88
right yeah

329.759 --> 335.68
ball busters was cool

332.88 --> 336.8
i thought that yeah it was really down

335.68 --> 340.40000000000003
my lane

336.8 --> 343.199
psychology the black swan and how the

340.4 --> 345.59999999999997
ballers twist things in the face of it

343.199 --> 347.68
kiwi putting it down the mechanics very

345.6 --> 350.08000000000004
elaborately

347.68 --> 350.96
me getting very active in chat and other

350.08 --> 353.199
places too

350.96 --> 354.79999999999995
because i was also kind of keen on

353.199 --> 357.199
following martin luther's

354.8 --> 360.08
flatter day night stream which is always

357.199 --> 360.08
very amusing

360.319 --> 367.03900000000004
he had some martin luther

363.52 --> 370.08
had some really had some good old

367.039 --> 372.56
footage again like camera footage a

370.08 --> 374.31899999999996
black and white colored in

372.56 --> 375.52
i don't know if he noticed that i tried

374.319 --> 377.68
to say that in chat but it was

375.52 --> 380.24
definitely hand colored afterward

377.68 --> 382.24
but just old city footage it's very

380.24 --> 385.6
fascinating to see

382.24 --> 386.88
like the old tech and how it was just

385.6 --> 389.28000000000003
working

386.88 --> 390.4
and that it was kind of seen as normal

389.28 --> 392.23999999999995
or even high-tech

390.4 --> 394.88
at the time and just the atmosphere of

392.24 --> 396.639
that it's very special to see it moving

394.88 --> 399.759
it's very different to just see me

396.639 --> 402.08
with people moving because then you can

399.759 --> 403.84000000000003
read off their stance what it's really

402.08 --> 407.12
like unlike with a

403.84 --> 410.63899999999995
singular photograph then it's much

407.12 --> 410.639
harder to to make that out

420.96 --> 424.79999999999995
password martin what

425.68 --> 437.84000000000003
right also what

438.16 --> 444.40000000000003
okay see richington

441.759 --> 444.40000000000003
that's fine

445.68 --> 450.319
yeah there's currently some crypto stuff

449.12 --> 454.4
happening as well

450.319 --> 455.03900000000004
on my side basically the the wallet that

454.4 --> 458.0
i had

455.039 --> 460.08
and i have to update this as well in the

458.0 --> 461.44
in the description box when i say donate

460.08 --> 463.599
to the crypto wallets

461.44 --> 464.639
like the wallets have to change because

463.599 --> 467.68
the system doesn't

464.639 --> 472.24
work anymore i mentioned it no it's

467.68 --> 474.56
it's show 888. see richington

472.24 --> 479.84000000000003
look look at the title are you seeing

474.56 --> 479.84
the title

481.039 --> 486.71999999999997
but yeah there's some movement going on

484.319 --> 488.47900000000004
and then gonna have to figure out like

486.72 --> 491.199
what new

488.479 --> 493.84
wallet i am going to utilize for future

491.199 --> 493.84000000000003
scenarios

494.319 --> 497.84000000000003
new soylent green background now i'll

497.28 --> 499.75899999999996
just

497.84 --> 502.4
i'm i'm probably going to switch it i i

499.759 --> 504.08000000000004
turn the the other background on

502.4 --> 506.23999999999995
because the weather out there is going

504.08 --> 509.68
to store me

506.24 --> 512.719
even though warm so i don't know

509.68 --> 516.5600000000001
i think the the mic is picking it up

512.719 --> 516.5600000000001
like regular thunder sounds

517.839 --> 521.839
clever is the best one okay

522.24 --> 525.919
i'll make a note of that

527.12 --> 531.6
because i will take on tips and then try

529.36 --> 532.32
to cross-reference that with my dad who

531.6 --> 534.32
is like

532.32 --> 536.88
more on top of it because he's also

534.32 --> 539.12
managing crypto situations of a whole

536.88 --> 542.72
bunch of other people because

539.12 --> 546.16
that's what the gti

542.72 --> 548.64
thing really is about a mobile wallet

546.16 --> 551.4399999999999
right he suggested another type of

548.64 --> 551.4399999999999
mobile wallet

551.839 --> 555.36
but yeah i've made the note

556.88 --> 561.519
we can compare it and i'm also going to

559.12 --> 563.519
test my dad like what are your sources

561.519 --> 565.04
do you actually have good advice sources

563.519 --> 567.2
for these sort of things

565.04 --> 569.519
because i have no real oversight of that

567.2 --> 569.519
stuff

572.6 --> 577.839
888.com too well no

580.24 --> 586.8
there's there's too many tips everywhere

583.44 --> 588.72
i it's not gonna happen i've already got

586.8 --> 590.3199999999999
some crypto situation

588.72 --> 591.9200000000001
right at some point i might take

590.32 --> 595.12
donations in crypto

591.92 --> 598.959
that are kind of foreign or whatever

595.12 --> 601.36
like outside of the norm my norm which

598.959 --> 604.0
is not a really big norm

601.36 --> 604.9590000000001
and then yeah we'll see but first i have

604.0 --> 607.839
to rearrange

604.959 --> 608.7199999999999
the uh the wallet situation i got

607.839 --> 612.0
currently

608.72 --> 614.0790000000001
so the links the crypto links in the

612.0 --> 617.36
description box are not

614.079 --> 620.079
basically not gonna function and i will

617.36 --> 620.0790000000001
remove them

621.36 --> 625.6800000000001
as soon as yeah i should have already

624.079 --> 628.079
done that actually today but i kind of

625.68 --> 628.079
forgot

628.32 --> 633.7600000000001
anyway hello nathan oakley 1980 jado

643.6 --> 650.0
not seeking star wars of course right

647.68 --> 650.7199999999999
so yeah something i did figure out

650.0 --> 654.24
yesterday

650.72 --> 657.839
all of a sudden is that owen benjamin's

654.24 --> 660.48
youtube channels have been removed again

657.839 --> 661.2790000000001
i noticed because they my favorite list

660.48 --> 663.519
suddenly

661.279 --> 665.12
which is like three recommended channel

663.519 --> 668.16
thing

665.12 --> 671.44
suddenly yeah they were missing both

668.16 --> 673.279
the channels so there is no more gary

671.44 --> 676.8000000000001
and terry

673.279 --> 677.2
and he's still uploading streams that he

676.8 --> 680.079
is

677.2 --> 682.1600000000001
doing on instagram live apparently i'm

680.079 --> 686.079
not part of instagram

682.16 --> 688.399
but he's still posting it on bitchu so

686.079 --> 692.0
he is still going but yeah the youtube

688.399 --> 692.0
channels have been taken down again

692.8 --> 707.04
so i don't know why why they do that

703.2 --> 707.0400000000001
so that happened weird

714.839 --> 719.7600000000001
uh

716.72 --> 724.5600000000001
right also finished up watching

719.76 --> 724.56
the second star wars sequel

724.639 --> 729.36
uh and yeah it's it's exactly as

727.44 --> 729.839
annoying as i thought it was but still

729.36 --> 731.92
some

729.839 --> 734.0790000000001
interesting moments but it was ruined

731.92 --> 734.079
like

738.88 --> 744.56
second movie had so many just unbearably

742.16 --> 747.76
annoying moments and it really

744.56 --> 749.279
the whole thing just gives the off the

747.76 --> 752.399
feeling like they don't

749.279 --> 754.0
take their public their crowd serious

752.399 --> 756.959
like they they're acting like you're

754.0 --> 760.16
stupid through the storytelling it's

756.959 --> 760.16
really annoying

763.04 --> 768.399
but still some just good moments like

766.48 --> 770.8000000000001
like those moments are good that you

768.399 --> 774.639
could literally just cut them out

770.8 --> 775.5999999999999
and then make something else out of it

774.639 --> 777.6
like

775.6 --> 779.9200000000001
it has some really good scenes and

777.6 --> 780.48
setups and then just a whole bunch of

779.92 --> 784.7199999999999
[ __ ]

780.48 --> 784.72
that you're like oh god they ruin it

784.839 --> 787.839
again

792.8 --> 804.959
right but i do kind of like the

801.6 --> 806.9590000000001
the kylo ren character i kind of liked

804.959 --> 809.1199999999999
what they did with him

806.959 --> 811.5189999999999
and in the first one he was just kind of

809.12 --> 815.2
like constantly raging and [ __ ]

811.519 --> 818.639
way over the top and kind of like out of

815.2 --> 821.9200000000001
place it didn't have the same

818.639 --> 823.6800000000001
like secret tension thing as how darth

821.92 --> 826.4799999999999
vader was doing things

823.68 --> 826.88
in the originals and so it's like yeah

826.48 --> 828.88
again

826.88 --> 830.8
over over-exaggerated point and in the

828.88 --> 833.4399999999999
second one

830.8 --> 835.12
they fixed that much better and he's

833.44 --> 838.72
much more like in this

835.12 --> 843.839
dark secret flow

838.72 --> 843.839
and yeah impressive

844.56 --> 848.2399999999999
like he is really the thing about the

847.04 --> 850.0
second movie that

848.24 --> 857.36
that stands out like that's that's

850.0 --> 860.959
pretty cool how they did that

857.36 --> 863.1990000000001
and a lot of force weirdness

860.959 --> 864.079
that they kind of introduce into it as

863.199 --> 866.56
well

864.079 --> 868.8389999999999
but it's still interesting they because

866.56 --> 873.3599999999999
they're basically like oh yeah

868.839 --> 877.6
scrying like scrying exactly

873.36 --> 880.88
it like the thing that they did where uh

877.6 --> 884.0790000000001
where rey and kylo ren were

880.88 --> 887.8389999999999
just communicating with visuals

884.079 --> 888.959
that's scrying like look into the curse

887.839 --> 892.639
crying spell

888.959 --> 894.3199999999999
uh i rewrote it in my dnd book

892.639 --> 896.32
but it's very close to the original

894.32 --> 900.1600000000001
that's exactly what it is

896.32 --> 902.48
including like there's this like this

900.16 --> 903.519
counter effect with scrying that if you

902.48 --> 906.399
scry somebody

903.519 --> 908.32
and they have like awareness of it then

906.399 --> 911.36
they can potentially like do

908.32 --> 912.88
things back right and that's kind of

911.36 --> 914.8000000000001
like they didn't even say that

912.88 --> 917.12
but but that was effectively happening

914.8 --> 920.079
like they were opening this gate

917.12 --> 921.92
between each other even physically

920.079 --> 924.7199999999999
because of their spiritual

921.92 --> 926.399
connection through this crying process

924.72 --> 928.48
and that was just very

926.399 --> 931.199
interesting about it so see so the whole

928.48 --> 933.6800000000001
movie is so

931.199 --> 934.399
some things like really suck and other

933.68 --> 941.8389999999999
things are like

934.399 --> 941.839
whoa that is fascinating

943.6 --> 954.24
right well i felt the same way the first

946.24 --> 957.36
time i saw it anyway

954.24 --> 960.48
china rocket debris yeah

957.36 --> 969.839
heard about it hello sev

960.48 --> 969.839
man rocket blimps

971.6 --> 983.839
i can't suspend my disbelief with space

973.839 --> 983.839
shows because of you guys why not

993.6 --> 999.279
all right did i mention anything about

995.92 --> 1002.079
like space mechanics at all

999.279 --> 1002.079
i don't think so

1004.32 --> 1008.9590000000001
right i could bring something up you

1006.72 --> 1008.9590000000001
know

1009.68 --> 1014.4799999999999
for example like the light speed cruiser

1013.04 --> 1016.7199999999999
ramming and all that

1014.48 --> 1018.72
yeah that's something that probably a

1016.72 --> 1021.9200000000001
whole bunch of people

1018.72 --> 1023.839
had been saying way before star wars

1021.92 --> 1026.72
fans like yeah why don't they do that

1023.839 --> 1026.72
they just have like

1027.12 --> 1033.4389999999999
like suicide ramming ships

1031.199 --> 1036.4
why don't they have special light speed

1033.439 --> 1038.4
jumping suicide bombers like [ __ ]

1036.4 --> 1040.4
it's like oh yeah that would give a

1038.4 --> 1041.6000000000001
whole nother feeling and make things

1040.4 --> 1045.679
really weird and cr

1041.6 --> 1049.12
and unbalanced and [ __ ] right

1045.679 --> 1051.1200000000001
but it was like the cgi of that moment

1049.12 --> 1053.28
was pretty damn impressive

1051.12 --> 1055.12
it was interesting like the visuals were

1053.28 --> 1058.08
very good i really like

1055.12 --> 1059.4399999999998
the one thing that they got very right

1058.08 --> 1062.559
about the sequels

1059.44 --> 1064.799
is that whether you're gonna

1062.559 --> 1066.0
suspend your disbelief over space and

1064.799 --> 1068.24
the mechanics of it

1066.0 --> 1069.28
because very little of that makes sense

1068.24 --> 1073.6
but they made it

1069.28 --> 1076.799
look really crisp really like

1073.6 --> 1081.4399999999998
good the visuals space visuals

1076.799 --> 1085.28
mechanics really good

1081.44 --> 1088.0800000000002
so yeah that but yeah it doesn't

1085.28 --> 1089.28
make the whole thing make any damn sense

1088.08 --> 1093.76
that parts just like

1089.28 --> 1096.32
okay especially like oh yeah there's

1093.76 --> 1099.039
giant spaceships in the middle of space

1096.32 --> 1102.48
so there's gravity now

1099.039 --> 1105.52
like why is there bombers that literally

1102.48 --> 1109.84
drop bombs in the middle of space

1105.52 --> 1109.84
like that makes no freaking sense

1117.28 --> 1123.28
when spaceships get shot why do they

1120.4 --> 1124.799
always fall down like they lose moment

1123.28 --> 1125.84
yeah that's for the feeling of it it's

1124.799 --> 1130.8799999999999
for the ship

1125.84 --> 1134.3999999999999
sinking right the visual of a giant ship

1130.88 --> 1137.2800000000002
tilting is very dramatic and impactful

1134.4 --> 1138.16
for for the viewer that's why they do it

1137.28 --> 1140.559
that's why they

1138.16 --> 1141.2
it always in the shot there's sometimes

1140.559 --> 1143.6
there's like

1141.2 --> 1146.0800000000002
top down shots where you see the ships

1143.6 --> 1148.08
like top down view

1146.08 --> 1150.96
it's a trick but most of the times you

1148.08 --> 1153.9189999999999
see him in the front of you above

1150.96 --> 1155.76
it's like this layer in front because it

1153.919 --> 1157.76
has to be intuitive right

1155.76 --> 1159.76
so if you get to see it like that with

1157.76 --> 1165.2
the top on the top and then

1159.76 --> 1168.4
it blows up and yeah that's

1165.2 --> 1168.799
based on the dramatic impact of really

1168.4 --> 1171.919
big

1168.799 --> 1174.32
ships tilting in the ocean and sinking

1171.919 --> 1176.48
that's what they base that on it's it's

1174.32 --> 1178.3999999999999
about the feelings

1176.48 --> 1179.6
right where do you associate it with if

1178.4 --> 1182.64
it's just

1179.6 --> 1187.52
like random totally floaty

1182.64 --> 1187.5200000000002
stuff that's a whole different sensation

1189.44 --> 1207.8400000000001
like i don't mind that it makes

1191.12 --> 1207.84
absolutely no sense

1210.559 --> 1217.9189999999999
he bit where they tried to add

1214.48 --> 1217.919
zero g was to what

1218.559 --> 1221.84
what do you mean

1225.919 --> 1235.8400000000001
hey the adam akin good to see you

1246.799 --> 1251.76
no yeah it seems like the storm is

1249.76 --> 1254.799
pretty much past now so i'm gonna also

1251.76 --> 1254.799
change the background

1260.84 --> 1266.48
right

1262.32 --> 1269.76
seems like most of it is gone now see

1266.48 --> 1269.76
much lighter over here

1272.799 --> 1278.8799999999999
still some slight thunder rolling in

1275.44 --> 1280.88
from background but it's all gone

1278.88 --> 1291.8400000000001
beyond the point where i can see the

1280.88 --> 1291.8400000000001
lightning so

1302.84 --> 1305.84
hmm

1311.28 --> 1313.52
what

1315.36 --> 1333.84
why the hell would you say something

1316.96 --> 1333.8400000000001
like that deaf man

1344.84 --> 1347.84
so

1348.799 --> 1355.039
wasn't there a part where leia floats

1350.96 --> 1358.8400000000001
for yes terminoid yeah that part was

1355.039 --> 1362.72
interesting as a concept

1358.84 --> 1364.08
but well i don't really like leia all

1362.72 --> 1368.08
that much

1364.08 --> 1370.8799999999999
in the movies in the in the sequels

1368.08 --> 1370.8799999999999
she was not

1372.799 --> 1380.32
she wasn't the leia from before and

1376.24 --> 1380.32
the way she was just made no sense

1382.0 --> 1388.32
right like

1385.039 --> 1391.76
for example

1388.32 --> 1395.039
if something like that happened to

1391.76 --> 1395.039
to what's the name again

1398.48 --> 1406.24
to ray then i'd be like

1401.52 --> 1408.72
wow that's like yeah

1406.24 --> 1410.0
because she is like really strong

1408.72 --> 1411.44
spirited

1410.0 --> 1413.44
well that's how the character was

1411.44 --> 1416.64
developed like with a lot of raw

1413.44 --> 1419.76
things so who knows but

1416.64 --> 1422.64
for leia to do that just seemed like

1419.76 --> 1422.64
what the [ __ ]

1422.96 --> 1427.44
like it just didn't fit i just really

1425.679 --> 1430.4
didn't like her in the movies

1427.44 --> 1432.799
like she was great india in the

1430.4 --> 1434.96
originals you know

1432.799 --> 1434.96
but

1436.64 --> 1440.159
i just didn't like her in here it just

1438.559 --> 1442.6399999999999
didn't seem like her

1440.159 --> 1444.159
didn't seem like an an older leia it

1442.64 --> 1447.679
just seemed like a lady

1444.159 --> 1447.679
playing leia i don't know

1455.36 --> 1459.84
what the hell rocket blimps

1481.44 --> 1486.3200000000002
realistic sci-fi has no part in star

1483.679 --> 1488.64
wars movies but i

1486.32 --> 1488.6399999999999
agree

1490.32 --> 1497.6789999999999
it's more about the impression it's a

1493.96 --> 1502.88
specification of colonial era

1497.679 --> 1505.8400000000001
and maybe even like world war ii era

1502.88 --> 1508.159
historical wars and all that and empires

1505.84 --> 1512.32
that's kind of the

1508.159 --> 1515.279
the idea the feel of it

1512.32 --> 1517.6
and so it's not really like star trek

1515.279 --> 1518.96
where they really get all nerdy and make

1517.6 --> 1522.1589999999999
it just as space

1518.96 --> 1524.64
stuff space realistic as possible and

1522.159 --> 1527.1200000000001
get into the details

1524.64 --> 1530.3200000000002
all that is secondary it's just a

1527.12 --> 1530.32
different approach

1534.0 --> 1537.76
right it's space opera style so it's not

1536.72 --> 1541.76
it's

1537.76 --> 1544.8799999999999
it's different it's a space opera

1541.76 --> 1550.0
space is the background

1544.88 --> 1550.0
it's the setup it's not really about it

1554.559 --> 1560.6399999999999
psy fantasy yeah

1557.679 --> 1560.64
you could call it that

1561.36 --> 1571.84
hey hello sun yin gohan

1565.84 --> 1571.84
zero here from kiwi all right

1584.24 --> 1589.6
good thing she wasn't born a boy yes she

1586.48 --> 1589.6
would call chewie

1589.84 --> 1599.84
okay tony we'd go

1609.279 --> 1614.72
it's death stars it's still more

1611.36 --> 1614.7199999999998
believable than nasa

1622.0 --> 1627.36
well yeah it is it is movie magic after

1624.88 --> 1630.4
all and nasa seems to have

1627.36 --> 1630.3999999999999
other objectives

1634.08 --> 1640.24
but it i think it's just part of the

1636.24 --> 1642.72
overall mind control project

1640.24 --> 1643.84
in the movies that's where they make it

1642.72 --> 1646.72
look really

1643.84 --> 1647.6
real right that's basically where they

1646.72 --> 1650.88
determine

1647.6 --> 1654.24
what to think is real and then nasa

1650.88 --> 1657.0390000000002
kind of poorly emulates it

1654.24 --> 1658.24
and and keeps suggesting with flaws in

1657.039 --> 1660.32
plain sight like this

1658.24 --> 1664.0
is the real thing and then it's up to

1660.32 --> 1664.0
you whether you fall for that or not

1664.48 --> 1683.76
i know who q is

1668.72 --> 1686.3990000000001
i was on a show yesterday evening

1683.76 --> 1687.919
that's why 2001 space city was the real

1686.399 --> 1691.4399999999998
mission

1687.919 --> 1696.24
right because space odysseys

1691.44 --> 1699.1200000000001
that those movies they used

1696.24 --> 1700.0
like the exploration with real earth

1699.12 --> 1702.9599999999998
setup right

1700.0 --> 1705.2
it's the more realistic sci-fi close to

1702.96 --> 1705.2
home

1707.36 --> 1711.36
and that is kind of like that those

1709.279 --> 1714.96
movies were like what people

1711.36 --> 1716.399
expected nasa to look like like that is

1714.96 --> 1721.44
what it should have been

1716.399 --> 1721.4399999999998
but instead we get well nasa garbage

1722.84 --> 1725.84
subpar

1746.08 --> 1749.1999999999998
they follow it up with apollo what do

1748.32 --> 1753.84
you mean

1749.2 --> 1753.8400000000001
you mean the movie

1757.74 --> 1760.829
[Music]

1769.2 --> 1775.1200000000001
okay i don't know what you're talking

1770.96 --> 1775.1200000000001
about def man but it seems kind of

1778.84 --> 1781.84
stupid

1790.48 --> 1809.84
on the sea release just before

1794.08 --> 1809.84
moon missions what

1820.84 --> 1823.84
so

1834.84 --> 1837.84
hmm

1845.52 --> 1854.48
a terror 306.

1851.2 --> 1858.32
okay i don't know what rhcp stands for

1854.48 --> 1858.32
sewing gohan zero

1858.399 --> 1864.1589999999999
they telespace is not real all the time

1860.64 --> 1866.88
well they do try to hint

1864.159 --> 1869.3600000000001
edit there's been plenty of hints

1866.88 --> 1873.519
everywhere

1869.36 --> 1874.799
and yeah besides they don't really even

1873.519 --> 1877.6
have to tell you

1874.799 --> 1881.279
you can figure it out that it's not real

1877.6 --> 1881.279
because it's physically impossible

1884.0 --> 1893.84
red hot chili peppers all right

1909.76 --> 1913.679
the lights don't refract a car gone

1912.399 --> 1921.84
behind the hill

1913.679 --> 1921.8400000000001
to being above the hill that's right

1942.42 --> 1945.509
[Music]

1946.84 --> 1949.84
hmm

1982.88 --> 1989.519
oh yeah by the way this is a side thing

1986.96 --> 1990.0
yesterday night i heard this bird

1989.519 --> 1993.36
singing

1990.0 --> 1995.84
way over there and i

1993.36 --> 1997.6789999999999
i haven't heard that kind of singing in

1995.84 --> 1999.519
a long time

1997.679 --> 2001.76
i think it might have even been like a

1999.519 --> 2003.76
nightingale

2001.76 --> 2004.8799999999999
because that was just the vocal range

2003.76 --> 2008.64
was just

2004.88 --> 2012.7990000000002
unbelievable and really

2008.64 --> 2013.2
beautiful and kept on going all over the

2012.799 --> 2015.6
place

2013.2 --> 2015.6000000000001
and like

2017.36 --> 2020.799
it wasn't like one of the typical

2018.88 --> 2022.72
singing birds so what are they called

2020.799 --> 2025.44
let me figure that let me google

2022.72 --> 2025.44
translate it

2028.32 --> 2033.6
all right blackbirds

2031.44 --> 2034.799
because blackbirds sing really like the

2033.6 --> 2038.24
males

2034.799 --> 2039.9189999999999
are great singers they're very common

2038.24 --> 2041.76
and they're always so cute when they

2039.919 --> 2045.039
basically make a lot of noise when they

2041.76 --> 2049.04
try to hide for you when you come by

2045.039 --> 2052.56
so that's i always found that ironic

2049.04 --> 2054.079
like you don't notice them

2052.56 --> 2056.0
but they notice you and then they're

2054.079 --> 2058.639
like oh quickly hide because

2056.0 --> 2059.359
they see me even though you never see

2058.639 --> 2061.119
them but

2059.359 --> 2063.679
when they start to hide then you hear

2061.119 --> 2067.76
them and that's usually black birds

2063.679 --> 2067.76
it's hilarious those creatures are just

2068.32 --> 2075.839
kind of odd but they sing great

2076.399 --> 2083.679
i like the robin song well yeah

2081.119 --> 2085.359
i don't see robins very often anymore

2083.679 --> 2086.399
there used to be a lot more of them in

2085.359 --> 2088.3199999999997
the netherlands but

2086.399 --> 2103.839
not so much anyway they're still around

2088.32 --> 2103.839
but not a lot of them

2112.079 --> 2117.8390000000004
yeah me too clutch bears yeah crows are

2114.24 --> 2117.839
really interesting

2120.16 --> 2125.44
but i've also find it funny that i just

2123.44 --> 2129.599
can feel of them that they have

2125.44 --> 2134.32
minor levels of self-consciousness

2129.599 --> 2134.32
which is unusual for for creatures

2135.76 --> 2139.76
like they you have a sense that they

2138.079 --> 2142.8390000000004
really have an ego

2139.76 --> 2144.0
and they're aware of it it's i i do

2142.839 --> 2148.0
anyway

2144.0 --> 2148.0
especially with the the male ones

2150.16 --> 2155.359
but maybe even what they do like that is

2152.88 --> 2155.359
a bluff

2156.0 --> 2160.079
because they do they they do

2158.24 --> 2163.04
psychological tactics

2160.079 --> 2164.2400000000002
a lot of it and they really know how to

2163.04 --> 2167.359
like

2164.24 --> 2170.7999999999997
have the right stance and how to impress

2167.359 --> 2171.2
and to be efficient etc etc yeah crows

2170.8 --> 2173.8390000000004
are

2171.2 --> 2173.839
interesting

2183.599 --> 2190.88
meadow lark that's an intricate

2186.96 --> 2193.76
meadowlark i don't know what that is

2190.88 --> 2195.6800000000003
mind you that a lot of names for birds

2193.76 --> 2201.8390000000004
are very different in english as they

2195.68 --> 2201.839
are in dutch so

2204.56 --> 2215.839
meadow lark

2219.599 --> 2225.44
wow they're very yellow

2223.2 --> 2227.7599999999998
that's interesting never seen one over

2225.44 --> 2228.0
here i don't think they're indigenous to

2227.76 --> 2230.5600000000004
the

2228.0 --> 2230.56
netherlands

2241.52 --> 2245.839
or maybe they are somewhere

2247.28 --> 2257.8390000000004
no there's a lot of birds everywhere

2249.76 --> 2257.8390000000004
it's hard to keep track of it all

2258.78 --> 2261.969
[Music]

2268.839 --> 2271.839
so

2288.24 --> 2293.9199999999996
what so onward what

2291.52 --> 2295.52
the reason i said that was because the

2293.92 --> 2299.839
luciferian system

2295.52 --> 2299.839
secret societies that run the world

2303.44 --> 2305.76
okay

2307.119 --> 2313.839
i know

2321.839 --> 2327.52
described as new world grassland bird

2324.64 --> 2327.52
all right so it's

2338.839 --> 2341.839
american

2349.68 --> 2355.839
right yes clutch bear it's funny because

2357.68 --> 2364.72
like crows especially they pay

2361.44 --> 2367.04
attention to humans like they

2364.72 --> 2368.24
pay more attention to humans than most

2367.04 --> 2371.68
humans pay attention

2368.24 --> 2374.72
to themselves and each other and

2371.68 --> 2377.359
when they see me like all crows even if

2374.72 --> 2378.7999999999997
i've never seen them

2377.359 --> 2380.839
obviously because it's like way

2378.8 --> 2384.32
somewhere else

2380.839 --> 2388.48
they take on the same stance so it's

2384.32 --> 2393.44
for me crows are kind of universal

2388.48 --> 2393.44
they're like their own group of people

2394.079 --> 2398.5600000000004
and they recognize me and my type and my

2396.96 --> 2401.2
stance

2398.56 --> 2403.119
and like they know i'm not gonna get in

2401.2 --> 2404.48
their way i don't misunderstand them i

2403.119 --> 2407.839
don't project anything

2404.48 --> 2411.2
negative on them for whatever reason

2407.839 --> 2414.0789999999997
right and then they like

2411.2 --> 2415.9199999999996
are not yeah they're not as shy like

2414.079 --> 2418.88
they're not afraid of when i

2415.92 --> 2418.88
just get close

2421.359 --> 2428.96
they use morphic resonance okay

2425.359 --> 2428.96
for what exactly rocket blimps

2430.319 --> 2434.64
because there's a lot of birds that use

2432.0 --> 2438.56
a lot of sound for a lot of things right

2434.64 --> 2441.5989999999997
there's also sonar scanning through

2438.56 --> 2443.2799999999997
through specific sounds that some birds

2441.599 --> 2446.96
make or they

2443.28 --> 2450.1600000000003
be clacking can be used to basically

2446.96 --> 2454.16
feel out the shape of this of

2450.16 --> 2457.52
the space it's like sonar

2454.16 --> 2460.64
and some type of tweet sounds also

2457.52 --> 2463.7599999999998
for long distance scanning and like yeah

2460.64 --> 2467.839
you pick up on that sort of trick many

2463.76 --> 2467.8390000000004
birds have it

2473.839 --> 2477.839
so the other crows learn new things oh

2476.319 --> 2480.24
right so you mean

2477.839 --> 2482.4
right like they're they share it like a

2480.24 --> 2486.319
telepathy

2482.4 --> 2490.1600000000003
all of it i would not be surprised

2486.319 --> 2490.16
i think actually humans have it too

2490.319 --> 2495.839
or they should

2496.319 --> 2500.64
but yeah crows probably have that too i

2498.64 --> 2502.7999999999997
think a whole bunch of animal types have

2500.64 --> 2502.7999999999997
it

2504.96 --> 2509.839
like in their dreams they all connect

2524.96 --> 2537.839
right they drop stuff on the road so

2528.16 --> 2537.839
cars will crush it

2539.2 --> 2544.319
yeah some also a trick i've noticed that

2542.16 --> 2547.44
crows specifically do

2544.319 --> 2548.24
is i i always have like a bowl of water

2547.44 --> 2551.04
out there

2548.24 --> 2552.3999999999996
available for birds to drink from and to

2551.04 --> 2555.599
wash in

2552.4 --> 2556.48
and then often lay out some bread as

2555.599 --> 2559.599
well

2556.48 --> 2563.68
and the crows all of them they know

2559.599 --> 2565.599
how to make soup so they get bread

2563.68 --> 2567.52
they know i this is a good place where

2565.599 --> 2570.56
there's always good water

2567.52 --> 2573.28
then they take the bread they dip it

2570.56 --> 2575.119
in the water like they actively make it

2573.28 --> 2575.92
soak up even like move it around in

2575.119 --> 2578.0
there

2575.92 --> 2579.44
to make it soak up water and then they

2578.0 --> 2581.839
eat that

2579.44 --> 2584.16
like it's specifically the crows that i

2581.839 --> 2592.56
always see doing that

2584.16 --> 2594.96
it's really funny

2592.56 --> 2596.88
they do it with nuts they crack it on

2594.96 --> 2607.839
the road yeah sure

2596.88 --> 2607.839
wouldn't be surprised

2618.839 --> 2621.839
hmm

2632.839 --> 2649.839
hmm yeah crows are very interesting

2638.88 --> 2649.839
i think so anyway

2654.56 --> 2659.839
ravens are able to mimic other animals

2657.119 --> 2659.839
huh really

2661.04 --> 2667.2
well you don't see ravens very often

2665.04 --> 2670.24
here

2667.2 --> 2671.52
you have to go further down south like

2670.24 --> 2675.1189999999997
the height of france

2671.52 --> 2677.44
and beyond maybe in germany too

2675.119 --> 2679.839
sometimes you could see ravens there but

2677.44 --> 2681.92
they don't come in the netherlands

2679.839 --> 2684.24
i think i in my entire life i've seen

2681.92 --> 2691.839
like a raven

2684.24 --> 2691.839
twice or three times

2692.96 --> 2699.28
what in the bible and the quran

2696.64 --> 2700.0789999999997
raven crows taught early man burial

2699.28 --> 2705.8390000000004
rituals

2700.079 --> 2705.8390000000004
what really

2706.319 --> 2719.839
why are you getting that that's the

2708.72 --> 2719.839
first time i'm hearing of that

2736.98 --> 2740.139
[Music]

2758.56 --> 2764.96
that can you be more specific with where

2761.76 --> 2764.96
slow mo and moon buggy

2769.52 --> 2775.839
i don't remember having read that

2780.64 --> 2784.24
but yeah in the back of my mind it does

2783.68 --> 2786.96
sound

2784.24 --> 2789.839
vaguely familiar there is something

2786.96 --> 2789.839
about it

2800.839 --> 2803.839
huh

2808.24 --> 2815.68
what what great parrot

2812.4 --> 2817.839
200 words and the national anthem

2815.68 --> 2817.839
damn

2818.8 --> 2825.76
that's some serious training

2822.0 --> 2831.839
like that's that's pretty remarkable

2825.76 --> 2831.8390000000004
for any type of parrot

2842.839 --> 2845.839
huh

2846.64 --> 2849.839
anyway yeah birds

2850.4 --> 2854.079
fascinating and there's a lot of them

2853.119 --> 2858.8
around here like

2854.079 --> 2862.0
this location is really great because

2858.8 --> 2863.599
i can hear like all the birds singing

2862.0 --> 2865.359
like in the entire

2863.599 --> 2867.92
environment and there's like trees

2865.359 --> 2867.92
everywhere

2871.119 --> 2875.52
so especially during springtime it's

2873.04 --> 2879.599
like always always birds

2875.52 --> 2880.72
in the background great and wild parrots

2879.599 --> 2883.839
like green ones

2880.72 --> 2887.839
or cockatoos whatever

2883.839 --> 2887.839
really tropical parrots i think

2888.24 --> 2891.68
that have like originally all been

2890.4 --> 2893.119
imported then

2891.68 --> 2895.1189999999997
managed to escape and they're now

2893.119 --> 2898.48
flocking around

2895.119 --> 2900.079
like they've become native like

2898.48 --> 2903.599
plenty of them have escaped that they

2900.079 --> 2905.52
now can just reproduce in the wild

2903.599 --> 2915.839
then they fly around in giant flocks and

2905.52 --> 2915.839
make a lot of noise

2917.44 --> 2920.8
ah not like that it's more like

2924.96 --> 2928.319
but with like this very sharp snappy

2927.44 --> 2930.96
high

2928.319 --> 2931.68
pitch sound on it i'm not gonna do that

2930.96 --> 2943.839
because it's

2931.68 --> 2943.839
kind of strenuous

2957.599 --> 2963.76
when you eat it makes the sound

2960.64 --> 2970.16
of your fork on the plate

2963.76 --> 2972.7200000000003
really like that's hilarious

2970.16 --> 2972.72
like a real

2973.92 --> 2980.0
yeah vocal genius type of parrot

2977.44 --> 2981.04
brilliant i love it when parrots have

2980.0 --> 2985.359
those weird

2981.04 --> 2987.2799999999997
sounds when they just make that sound

2985.359 --> 2989.2
that they picked up somewhere and like

2987.28 --> 2990.559
that really brings out intuitive

2989.2 --> 2992.5589999999997
responses

2990.559 --> 2993.599
like what what's that and then it's just

2992.559 --> 2999.8390000000004
that creature

2993.599 --> 2999.839
doing that sound it's hilarious

3001.13 --> 3004.34
[Music]

3022.0 --> 3026.079
it gets really weird when parrots like

3024.96 --> 3029.119
know how to make

3026.079 --> 3033.76
the sound of like a door

3029.119 --> 3036.96
unlocking or opening up and closing

3033.76 --> 3039.119
including of the door going like

3036.96 --> 3041.359
if they sit in a room where there is a

3039.119 --> 3042.559
door like that with distinct sounds from

3041.359 --> 3044.5589999999997
the lock

3042.559 --> 3047.0400000000004
when you open it up and close they might

3044.559 --> 3048.48
copy that now that gets weird

3047.04 --> 3050.5589999999997
because then they can just suddenly make

3048.48 --> 3051.839
the sound like somebody's coming in and

3050.559 --> 3055.92
you're like what

3051.839 --> 3057.44
damn you bird they can copy all kinds of

3055.92 --> 3061.04
sound that your intuition

3057.44 --> 3061.04
responds to it's really weird

3062.24 --> 3069.839
i like the ones who make chainsaw noises

3064.88 --> 3069.839
oh goody

3080.839 --> 3083.839
ugh

3108.839 --> 3111.839
really

3122.839 --> 3125.839
hmm

3130.0 --> 3135.68
used to make the sound of the door

3131.76 --> 3135.6800000000003
knocker right yeah that'll typically

3136.839 --> 3139.839
happen

3144.0 --> 3147.839
i wouldn't want to have a parrot myself

3146.079 --> 3148.1600000000003
like in my own heart like that would be

3147.839 --> 3153.839
just

3148.16 --> 3153.839
really distracting to me

3155.599 --> 3160.7200000000003
but yeah they are pretty remarkable

3164.839 --> 3167.839
birds

3178.839 --> 3181.839
uh

3206.839 --> 3211.44
one

3208.8 --> 3211.44
oh really

3217.359 --> 3226.0
that's incredible so that parrot

3221.2 --> 3226.0
is actually vocally communicating then

3229.359 --> 3237.7599999999998
that's that is pretty amazing

3236.0 --> 3240.48
that's not just parodying then it

3237.76 --> 3243.0400000000004
actually understands

3240.48 --> 3243.92
basic communicative interactions

3243.04 --> 3246.16
verbally

3243.92 --> 3247.839
or like a so like she doesn't literally

3246.16 --> 3248.48
have to understand the words but she

3247.839 --> 3251.7599999999998
knows

3248.48 --> 3253.839
those that there's a specific pattern

3251.76 --> 3255.119
that associates with a specific

3253.839 --> 3257.2799999999997
situation that

3255.119 --> 3259.6800000000003
is like basic language comprehension

3257.28 --> 3263.3590000000004
that's pretty remarkable

3259.68 --> 3267.04
for any bird that's awesome like that's

3263.359 --> 3269.2799999999997
the like monkeys

3267.04 --> 3270.16
could be trained with language and then

3269.28 --> 3271.76
that is like

3270.16 --> 3279.839
one of the best things they can get out

3271.76 --> 3279.8390000000004
of it so that's really remarkable

3286.64 --> 3293.839
yeah i got a bit of a brownie here

3309.04 --> 3321.839
what do you mean matthew eastman

3323.04 --> 3327.7599999999998
well clutch bear in ways yes

3329.76 --> 3334.4
but humans do have unique ranges of

3332.799 --> 3337.92
intelligence though

3334.4 --> 3339.44
pretty unique it's just that people also

3337.92 --> 3342.559
have the unique talent

3339.44 --> 3343.599
to be extremely stupid and naive and

3342.559 --> 3347.44
delusional

3343.599 --> 3350.559
and still somehow survive right

3347.44 --> 3354.4
it requires some brilliance to be

3350.559 --> 3354.4
that stupid and still survive

3354.799 --> 3366.079
right that's complicated

3363.839 --> 3367.599
so our overall understanding of what

3366.079 --> 3371.04
intelligence really is

3367.599 --> 3374.079
is kind of worked because of just

3371.04 --> 3374.079
the crazy world

3375.599 --> 3380.559
because of the active psychological

3377.44 --> 3382.96
warfare that makes

3380.559 --> 3384.1600000000003
it warps everything even our

3382.96 --> 3387.2
understanding our

3384.16 --> 3388.0789999999997
our sensibility like what's the level of

3387.2 --> 3390.5589999999997
this

3388.079 --> 3392.4
all of that gets warped around because

3390.559 --> 3395.119
of the psychological warfare over

3392.4 --> 3395.119
generations

3402.96 --> 3406.559
all things have intelligence

3411.2 --> 3418.64
well no

3414.4 --> 3420.2400000000002
intelligent design yes but that doesn't

3418.64 --> 3421.7599999999998
have to do with the consciousness most

3420.24 --> 3427.2
of it is like

3421.76 --> 3428.96
a logical effective response

3427.2 --> 3433.839
but that doesn't mean it's a conscious

3428.96 --> 3433.839
process intelligence requires conscious

3436.319 --> 3442.96
there's no thing no form of life

3439.599 --> 3446.079
that is stupid that has been designed

3442.96 --> 3449.119
just stupid right that is something

3446.079 --> 3451.92
you could say the design is is com every

3449.119 --> 3453.599
design is complete

3451.92 --> 3455.2000000000003
that doesn't mean those things in

3453.599 --> 3459.2000000000003
themselves

3455.2 --> 3462.24
are literally intelligent they just have

3459.2 --> 3464.64
capabilities that required intelligent

3462.24 --> 3464.64
design

3465.92 --> 3478.0
that's so how i would see that

3475.76 --> 3479.44
yeah clutch bear indeed tree roots

3478.0 --> 3482.559
communicate

3479.44 --> 3486.079
fungi dude fungi is like

3482.559 --> 3488.48
the internet of the forest

3486.079 --> 3490.96
that's that's where things get really

3488.48 --> 3490.96
bizarre

3494.079 --> 3497.599
right that doesn't mean that the roots

3496.96 --> 3501.92
or the

3497.599 --> 3502.7200000000003
literal plants have literal intelligence

3501.92 --> 3504.88
they don't

3502.72 --> 3506.319
really have a conscience to that level

3504.88 --> 3510.1600000000003
but they do

3506.319 --> 3517.839
are part of intelligence they have

3510.16 --> 3517.839
logos design

3527.359 --> 3531.839
like inspector clues here

3538.64 --> 3545.2799999999997
ah you found the crow burial rights link

3542.16 --> 3547.2799999999997
street directory okay thanks for

3545.28 --> 3559.8390000000004
finding it by the way i'll check it out

3547.28 --> 3559.8390000000004
what is this

3584.839 --> 3587.839
okay

3598.839 --> 3601.839
huh

3604.48 --> 3611.52
wow okay just browsing through that that

3608.559 --> 3611.52
is fascinating

3612.64 --> 3619.44
so there are there seem to be some hints

3615.839 --> 3623.359
at basically spiritual

3619.44 --> 3627.04
senses that the ravens have

3623.359 --> 3630.64
that they react to sin and such

3627.04 --> 3633.44
like they that's fascinating

3630.64 --> 3633.44
to say the least

3635.2 --> 3639.04
ever heard of that fungus that takes

3636.88 --> 3640.839
over yeah that's like some tropical

3639.04 --> 3642.24
thing

3640.839 --> 3645.48
ugh

3642.24 --> 3645.4799999999996
[Music]

3668.0 --> 3671.76
all right but it was serious like rocket

3669.92 --> 3674.96
blimps like what

3671.76 --> 3680.079
a guy did attached lie

3674.96 --> 3680.079
detectors to a plant how

3680.319 --> 3685.44
like seriously you can just like i know

3683.359 --> 3686.96
you can talk to plants and they respond

3685.44 --> 3688.4
right that's just

3686.96 --> 3690.799
that's something that's pretty much

3688.4 --> 3692.88
general knowledge now

3690.799 --> 3694.72
that it has a positive effect even like

3692.88 --> 3696.4
your intentions how do you talk are you

3694.72 --> 3699.52
being encouraging loving

3696.4 --> 3702.48
or are you gonna curse at them right

3699.52 --> 3704.88
so sure there is a like a weird ethereal

3702.48 --> 3708.799
communicative

3704.88 --> 3714.88
thing a responsive thing

3708.799 --> 3714.88
but lying and light attack that is just

3715.359 --> 3719.2
how how can a plant lie

3720.16 --> 3728.48
like how can it give a live response

3723.76 --> 3728.48
influence to a question

3734.799 --> 3739.2
you mean are you meaning to say that

3736.72 --> 3741.2
plants can like lie to themselves

3739.2 --> 3742.319
if you ask them certain things that they

3741.2 --> 3745.359
will lie about it

3742.319 --> 3746.16
that just what the hell this is way too

3745.359 --> 3749.2
much man

3746.16 --> 3752.24
this is way too bizarre to just

3749.2 --> 3755.839
vaguely drop something in chat like that

3752.24 --> 3755.839
and not get more specific

3774.96 --> 3778.7200000000003
it just picks up sentence

3780.319 --> 3787.119
okay so it is like okay just picking up

3784.319 --> 3787.119
a reaction

3792.0 --> 3799.119
that's it uh sure well that's

3795.039 --> 3799.119
i knew that basically said that

3800.96 --> 3811.839
hello iron 26

3850.839 --> 3855.5099999999998
oh

3853.28 --> 3858.679
oh really

3855.51 --> 3858.679
[Music]

3859.599 --> 3864.559
wow well dude that

3862.64 --> 3866.96
serious rocker blimps that does not

3864.559 --> 3869.119
surprise me one bit

3866.96 --> 3871.839
because i have such a relation with my

3869.119 --> 3875.039
plants as well

3871.839 --> 3877.92
like i feel like there is an open well

3875.039 --> 3879.5200000000004
sub to let telepathic communication with

3877.92 --> 3880.2400000000002
the plants that i take care of and they

3879.52 --> 3882.0
respond

3880.24 --> 3885.0389999999998
really well to it they like it that i

3882.0 --> 3885.039
take them serious

3889.039 --> 3895.119
like as living entities they appreciate

3892.48 --> 3898.2400000000002
that a lot and they know they could do a

3895.119 --> 3898.2400000000002
lot worse out there

3898.4 --> 3905.039
but yeah they that's not wreck

3901.92 --> 3907.2000000000003
substance the substance like the

3905.039 --> 3909.3590000000004
the plant itself no it's it's just the

3907.2 --> 3913.1189999999997
spirit of the planet i don't know man it

3909.359 --> 3916.64
gets really weird like that i am

3913.119 --> 3919.92
strange but it works

3916.64 --> 3923.839
ever think of getting a motorcycle no no

3919.92 --> 3923.839
not gonna do that

3930.72 --> 3935.0389999999998
i'm not much of a motorcycle guy they

3933.359 --> 3938.16
they freak me out

3935.039 --> 3940.96
it's too much power too too dangerous

3938.16 --> 3940.96
i don't like them

3942.079 --> 3945.599
i mean they're cool and all i'm not

3944.559 --> 3947.76
saying there shouldn't be any

3945.599 --> 3949.6800000000003
motorcycles but it's just

3947.76 --> 3951.8390000000004
it's a risk i'm not really willing to

3949.68 --> 3951.839
take

3971.359 --> 3974.96
he has rocket blimps yeah i've seen that

3974.079 --> 3976.88
the the

3974.96 --> 3980.079
the love rise experiment yeah there is a

3976.88 --> 3980.079
response i know

3984.64 --> 3988.96
intention matters everything it always

3987.359 --> 3991.2
does

3988.96 --> 3992.0
and with everything like even with

3991.2 --> 3996.24
inanimate

3992.0 --> 4000.0
substance it all responds

3996.24 --> 4004.4799999999996
it's like intention and conscious focus

4000.0 --> 4007.839
is like a separate dimensional substance

4004.48 --> 4007.839
of its own

4008.48 --> 4013.599
like the force in star wars it's like

4010.88 --> 4016.96
it's separate substance

4013.599 --> 4020.0
on top of everything so maybe

4016.96 --> 4025.119
attention and conscious focus

4020.0 --> 4025.119
is the force is the root of the force

4027.44 --> 4032.0
because it all matters every single time

4032.4 --> 4039.44
and that's also why there is no secrets

4036.24 --> 4043.359
there in there technically

4039.44 --> 4045.599
is no such a thing as keeping a secret

4043.359 --> 4047.68
there's only hiding something to

4045.599 --> 4049.6800000000003
yourself that's the only real secret

4047.68 --> 4053.68
that's the only real

4049.68 --> 4057.2
occult is to hide things for yourself

4053.68 --> 4060.16
because others will see it

4057.2 --> 4062.24
one way or the other things will see it

4060.16 --> 4066.16
the environment will reflect

4062.24 --> 4068.64
upon what you do even if you hide it for

4066.16 --> 4068.64
yourself

4069.28 --> 4074.2400000000002
and also yeah however you approach that

4072.72 --> 4076.1189999999997
dynamic

4074.24 --> 4077.839
as if it is like a group of

4076.119 --> 4080.2400000000002
consciousnesses

4077.839 --> 4082.839
consciousness how do you say multiple

4080.24 --> 4086.24
consciousness

4082.839 --> 4089.52
consciousnesses or whether it is

4086.24 --> 4092.3999999999996
purely reflective like the environment

4089.52 --> 4094.88
without consciousness absorbs literally

4092.4 --> 4097.6
what you do whatever you think of it

4094.88 --> 4099.52
and then that absorption is an accurate

4097.6 --> 4101.4400000000005
portrayal reflection right so it

4099.52 --> 4103.4400000000005
doesn't even matter whether you perceive

4101.44 --> 4104.879999999999
their everything to have its own

4103.44 --> 4108.239
consciousness

4104.88 --> 4111.6
see through you reflect that or whether

4108.239 --> 4115.839
you just think it absorbs whatever you

4111.6 --> 4118.96
do on incredible detailed level

4115.839 --> 4121.199
energy-wise even though you might

4118.96 --> 4122.719
oversimplify to yourself or start hiding

4121.199 --> 4124.4
things about what you've done to

4122.719 --> 4128.4800000000005
yourself like all

4124.4 --> 4128.48
is imprinted

4130.0 --> 4138.159
in the ethereal body of the realm

4134.64 --> 4146.319
the force the weave the

4138.159 --> 4149.44
subtle bodies of all things

4146.319 --> 4151.279
right and that's why i learned to figure

4149.44 --> 4154.799
out

4151.279 --> 4157.120000000001
to stop pretending like you can get away

4154.799 --> 4160.239
with lies

4157.12 --> 4163.599999999999
because yeah i've had my own phase

4160.239 --> 4163.599999999999
like that in the past

4163.759 --> 4168.48
where i just thought like but i can

4166.239 --> 4169.12
really fool somebody really well into

4168.48 --> 4172.4
thinking

4169.12 --> 4174.159
something even though it's not true

4172.4 --> 4177.92
right as long as they don't know it it's

4174.159 --> 4182.719
okay no it's not okay

4177.92 --> 4185.759
it really isn't and then you can draw in

4182.719 --> 4187.12
the analogy god is always watching even

4185.759 --> 4190.239
if you're not

4187.12 --> 4194.239
even if you close your eyes to god

4190.239 --> 4198.48
to the truth then the truth will still

4194.239 --> 4201.04
see you god will still see you

4198.48 --> 4203.5199999999995
see see how that all fits together

4201.04 --> 4217.84
seamlessly

4203.52 --> 4217.84
the analogy

4220.239 --> 4231.839999999999
chandra bose indian leader

4223.44 --> 4231.839999999999
on the german side world war ii what

4242.8 --> 4246.400000000001
yeah you did matthew eastman i'd

4244.64 --> 4250.2390000000005
appreciate it if people

4246.4 --> 4253.5199999999995
in general took a little more care

4250.239 --> 4259.678999999999
in and just look at

4253.52 --> 4261.92
how you're writing in chat is it correct

4259.679 --> 4261.92
right

4263.36 --> 4266.96
don't make a mess of it double check

4265.6 --> 4269.679
what you put down don't

4266.96 --> 4270.2390000000005
trust on stupid spell checking systems

4269.679 --> 4274.4800000000005
because they

4270.239 --> 4274.48
always fail always

4275.36 --> 4278.88
you have to check whether it as you read

4278.4 --> 4282.08
it

4278.88 --> 4283.12
makes sense it's not just you rocket

4282.08 --> 4286.719
blimps

4283.12 --> 4289.92
or matthew eastman all of you

4286.719 --> 4293.52
don't be sloppy it's very

4289.92 --> 4293.52
confusing when you do that

4298.84 --> 4301.679
uh

4300.0 --> 4304.239
right by rocket blimps no i haven't

4301.679 --> 4304.2390000000005
heard about

4305.04 --> 4310.8
about that at all started planned

4308.4 --> 4315.839999999999
experiments

4310.8 --> 4315.84
yeah i wouldn't be surprised

4353.52 --> 4358.64
okay well rocket lim's never heard of

4355.76 --> 4358.64
him ever

4362.48 --> 4366.799999999999
i know incredibly little about

4365.36 --> 4370.159
activities surrounding

4366.8 --> 4373.679
india during world war ii like very

4370.159 --> 4376.08
very very little basically absolutely

4373.679 --> 4376.08
nothing

4376.4 --> 4379.44
i know all kinds of things all around

4378.88 --> 4382.96
the world

4379.44 --> 4399.839999999999
were happening during that time

4382.96 --> 4399.84
india don't know anything really

4424.0 --> 4430.32
oh wow i've already

4427.679 --> 4431.1990000000005
been going past an hour i hadn't even

4430.32 --> 4435.199
noticed

4431.199 --> 4435.199
just talking about birds mostly

4438.84 --> 4455.84
and

4440.0 --> 4455.84
spirit communication

4460.88 --> 4463.12
hmm

4464.08 --> 4469.36
right rocket blimps well it it it does

4466.48 --> 4473.12
make sense

4469.36 --> 4476.32
because big part of india

4473.12 --> 4478.96
has aryan roots and the germans

4476.32 --> 4478.96
knew that

4481.44 --> 4486.799999999999
so that makes sense that they were going

4483.44 --> 4491.12
to join germany and that

4486.8 --> 4491.12
england kind of had to bribe them out of

4494.84 --> 4497.84
that

4516.77 --> 4521.189
[Music]

4522.84 --> 4528.259
okay

4524.43 --> 4528.259
[Music]

4558.64 --> 4566.96
oh nice wow weather really cleared up

4563.52 --> 4568.719
look at that like literally

4566.96 --> 4571.04
all the droplets have gone from the

4568.719 --> 4574.159
windows

4571.04 --> 4576.8
and it's much more hazy let's stay with

4574.159 --> 4578.639999999999
pieces of blue up there and the sun is

4576.8 --> 4581.84
coming through and the wind's even gone

4578.64 --> 4581.84
down so

4594.64 --> 4599.04
yeah storm has definitely cleared out

4606.88 --> 4612.32
right so rocket blimps you wanted to

4608.64 --> 4612.320000000001
bring out some kind of point with that

4613.04 --> 4616.08
so is there anything you know about it

4615.44 --> 4619.36
about this

4616.08 --> 4623.36
indian ss division or yeah

4619.36 --> 4625.12
you have something to share with us

4623.36 --> 4626.5599999999995
because i'm pretty sure there were like

4625.12 --> 4628.8
ss divisions

4626.56 --> 4637.84
all over the freaking world right in

4628.8 --> 4637.84
africa too

4639.12 --> 4641.36
um

4644.4 --> 4648.5599999999995
so like the whole world was divided

4648.64 --> 4651.92
like that uh he was the guy with the

4651.04 --> 4655.199
plants okay

4651.92 --> 4658.0
fine guy with the plants goody

4655.199 --> 4658.0
i know that

4662.84 --> 4665.84
like

4666.159 --> 4672.159
they were kind of like very spiritually

4669.44 --> 4672.159
liberated

4672.719 --> 4676.4800000000005
as in much more yeah about that sort of

4675.84 --> 4678.719
thing

4676.48 --> 4681.199
welcome to that sort of thing also to

4678.719 --> 4683.12
german new medicine that was also at the

4681.199 --> 4687.5199999999995
time

4683.12 --> 4690.239
happening and like ss

4687.52 --> 4693.040000000001
the nazis they were technically more

4690.239 --> 4696.718999999999
open to that

4693.04 --> 4700.159
they were just still a dark controlling

4696.719 --> 4700.159
order on top of that

4704.84 --> 4707.84
right

4718.84 --> 4721.84
hmm

4732.96 --> 4737.36
most of what everyone hears about in

4734.88 --> 4740.4800000000005
others is mythology

4737.36 --> 4740.48
well that's because

4742.64 --> 4749.84
because of well blatantly obvious

4744.88 --> 4749.84
political influence

4751.52 --> 4758.2390000000005
movies just showing you the horror parts

4755.52 --> 4758.8
like the few moments right even though

4758.239 --> 4763.04
yeah

4758.8 --> 4765.679
pretty much every group every group

4763.04 --> 4768.239
every military group has had those

4765.679 --> 4772.4800000000005
terrible types of moments

4768.239 --> 4774.5599999999995
everyone like that's not unique to nazis

4772.48 --> 4777.839999999999
and that's also not the only thing that

4774.56 --> 4777.84
they were doing

4780.48 --> 4788.159
right like a british empire is

4784.159 --> 4791.839999999999
just filled with like really

4788.159 --> 4796.639999999999
really dark atrocities really bad

4791.84 --> 4796.64
and freaking america man dude

4796.8 --> 4800.56
these people are not saints

4801.92 --> 4808.08
and yeah just like

4805.04 --> 4809.28
try to point at some kind of a big

4808.08 --> 4812.4
country that has been

4809.28 --> 4816.719
imperial they're all [ __ ] up it's

4812.4 --> 4816.719
part of it it's just the darknesses does

4816.84 --> 4819.84
that

4822.48 --> 4827.199
but yeah the nazis have been definitely

4825.199 --> 4829.04
highlighted as oh these are the

4827.199 --> 4832.638999999999
exemplary baddies

4829.04 --> 4837.12
these are the ones you're trying to

4832.639 --> 4837.12
persecute or not become or whatever

4845.44 --> 4849.199
kind of done some messed up stuff the

4847.12 --> 4852.719
natives will find a country where

4849.199 --> 4853.919999999999
stuff yeah messed up stuff has not been

4852.719 --> 4856.2390000000005
done to natives okay

4853.92 --> 4857.4400000000005
try to find me one freaking country in

4856.239 --> 4860.959999999999
the world

4857.44 --> 4864.5599999999995
where that hasn't happened at some point

4860.96 --> 4866.32
one find one country in the world where

4864.56 --> 4869.6
that hasn't happened

4866.32 --> 4875.84
in any point in history oh

4869.6 --> 4875.84
there isn't any yeah no [ __ ]

4875.99 --> 4879.09
[Music]

4886.8 --> 4893.12
that rocket lim japan are you serious

4890.0 --> 4894.88
you know how freaking bloody japan has

4893.12 --> 4897.04
been man

4894.88 --> 4898.32
and you know like they were like

4897.04 --> 4902.239
slaughtering each other

4898.32 --> 4904.799999999999
left and right like insane

4902.239 --> 4908.4
yeah they had an honor system but it was

4904.8 --> 4908.400000000001
freaking bloody as hell

4909.36 --> 4916.799999999999
like they definitely slaughtered natives

4914.32 --> 4917.679
it's just that they were the natives or

4916.8 --> 4919.92
rather like oh

4917.679 --> 4921.1990000000005
one group on this side of the island the

4919.92 --> 4922.8
other group on the other side yeah

4921.199 --> 4925.28
they're freaking slaughtering each other

4922.8 --> 4925.28
right so

4925.44 --> 4932.32
they haven't been colonized

4928.8 --> 4935.4400000000005
they still do it right whether you get

4932.32 --> 4936.96
colonized and then as original natives

4935.44 --> 4939.599999999999
get persecuted

4936.96 --> 4940.0
or whether you don't get colonized and

4939.6 --> 4942.639
you

4940.0 --> 4943.36
just persecute your own yeah that

4942.639 --> 4948.32
happens

4943.36 --> 4951.44
all the freaking time every country ever

4948.32 --> 4951.44
every location

4957.04 --> 4960.48
right and they did yeah yeah they

4959.679 --> 4964.4
definitely

4960.48 --> 4965.759999999999
had their uh their freaky moments

4964.4 --> 4968.719
where they went after china and the

4965.76 --> 4971.280000000001
philippines that's right

4968.719 --> 4971.76
but it was specifically referring to

4971.28 --> 4975.5199999999995
well

4971.76 --> 4987.84
regions and the natives being persecuted

4975.52 --> 4987.84
and all all of it everywhere

4988.56 --> 4995.679
like maybe maybe

4992.239 --> 5000.638999999999
arguably switzerland

4995.679 --> 5004.08
might be like the only one

5000.639 --> 5004.719
but that yeah that is kind of a unique

5004.08 --> 5007.28
thing and

5004.719 --> 5009.04
maybe other like these fortress

5007.28 --> 5012.159
mountainous

5009.04 --> 5016.159
people but

5012.159 --> 5018.799999999999
yeah then it always turns into like

5016.159 --> 5021.04
everything is about that and about just

5018.8 --> 5024.56
being that fortress

5021.04 --> 5026.159
that cannot be overcome and then like

5024.56 --> 5027.6
the entire country and the culture

5026.159 --> 5030.08
becomes about that

5027.6 --> 5032.0
to ensure that that stays and it doesn't

5030.08 --> 5036.5599999999995
get colonized anyway and [ __ ]

5032.0 --> 5038.8
you know papua new guinea

5036.56 --> 5038.8
uh

5040.0 --> 5046.08
so well yeah dude do you know what like

5044.159 --> 5056.4
the indonesians did there

5046.08 --> 5059.36
that was horrific

5056.4 --> 5059.92
all right but yeah what's the point why

5059.36 --> 5064.08
bring this

5059.92 --> 5064.08
up really like why do you want to know

5068.84 --> 5071.84
why

5082.84 --> 5085.84
so

5090.96 --> 5094.56
why am i talking about this

5097.199 --> 5101.04
well like seriously are you gonna make a

5100.639 --> 5104.0
map

5101.04 --> 5106.96
around the world and then catalog every

5104.0 --> 5110.159
disgusting genocidal slaughter that has

5106.96 --> 5111.44
ever happened so you can literally flag

5110.159 --> 5113.44
like oh yeah this one

5111.44 --> 5115.759999999999
slaughtered that amount of people over

5113.44 --> 5118.879999999999
there and that one slaughtered that and

5115.76 --> 5121.76
then just to have this giant map with

5118.88 --> 5122.88
5 000 flags stuck in everything of all

5121.76 --> 5124.8
the genocides

5122.88 --> 5126.56
right and then what what are you gonna

5124.8 --> 5128.8
do with that then

5126.56 --> 5131.360000000001
are you gonna gloat how [ __ ] up an

5128.8 --> 5133.6
evil humanity really is

5131.36 --> 5134.48
and then feel like a real special boy

5133.6 --> 5138.56
because you know

5134.48 --> 5141.04
how [ __ ] disgusting people get

5138.56 --> 5143.280000000001
like why why are you even bringing this

5141.04 --> 5143.28
up

5143.76 --> 5147.04
i don't want to talk about this

5150.0 --> 5155.84
don't gloat over slaughter

5157.36 --> 5163.759999999999
it's sick right it's just like people

5160.96 --> 5166.32
getting obsessed with like

5163.76 --> 5167.1990000000005
disgusting deep state bedo [ __ ] and all

5166.32 --> 5169.759999999999
that and then oh

5167.199 --> 5170.638999999999
let's let's draw it out in detail like

5169.76 --> 5174.159000000001
that is

5170.639 --> 5176.8
sick to do that is sick right to try to

5174.159 --> 5179.199
carefully inform people about it

5176.8 --> 5180.159000000001
and make a point is one thing but to

5179.199 --> 5182.96
then just like

5180.159 --> 5185.04
gloat and obsess and draw it out why

5182.96 --> 5185.92
don't you make a painting of what you're

5185.04 --> 5188.32
seeing in your head

5185.92 --> 5189.76
you think that's a good thing or is that

5188.32 --> 5193.599999999999
literally you just getting

5189.76 --> 5197.52
spellbound by absolute evil in a trance

5193.6 --> 5201.04
of the evil not in control

5197.52 --> 5203.679
right you gotta

5201.04 --> 5204.88
prevent your mind from dwelling on that

5203.679 --> 5207.1990000000005
[ __ ]

5204.88 --> 5208.0
because they become nightmares that

5207.199 --> 5211.5199999999995
haunt you

5208.0 --> 5225.84
and that strip your soul away

5211.52 --> 5225.84
because you dwell on it

5228.08 --> 5231.36
you got to be careful right being

5230.0 --> 5235.28
informed

5231.36 --> 5238.719
to know to get real is one thing

5235.28 --> 5239.28
don't dwell on the sickness on the

5238.719 --> 5242.719
darkness

5239.28 --> 5245.04
on the plague on the disgusting things

5242.719 --> 5246.32
that have happened in history don't do

5245.04 --> 5249.679
that

5246.32 --> 5250.5599999999995
it only makes you closer to iron man

5249.679 --> 5253.679
makes you more

5250.56 --> 5256.400000000001
accepting of absolute death and torture

5253.679 --> 5257.76
it desensitizes you to the true sickness

5256.4 --> 5260.799999999999
that it is

5257.76 --> 5263.92
and makes it more welcome

5260.8 --> 5267.84
that's what that does

5263.92 --> 5272.56
don't dwell in the darkness

5267.84 --> 5272.56
it makes the darkness part of you

5272.719 --> 5276.8
whatever you think you are whatever you

5275.36 --> 5278.48
think you're doing

5276.8 --> 5280.0
whether you're supposed to be good or

5278.48 --> 5282.5599999999995
supposed to be fighting it

5280.0 --> 5285.199
if you dwell in darkness darkness

5282.56 --> 5285.1990000000005
becomes you

5286.56 --> 5295.84
i know from experience

5305.36 --> 5308.5599999999995
right so every time you draw in some

5308.159 --> 5312.239
some

5308.56 --> 5312.2390000000005
darkness thing right

5312.32 --> 5318.159
why always think why are you doing it

5315.76 --> 5320.320000000001
or if somebody else is doing why are

5318.159 --> 5322.799999999999
they doing it

5320.32 --> 5323.92
why are they doing that why are you

5322.8 --> 5325.679
bringing it up

5323.92 --> 5328.08
is there an irrelevant point you're

5325.679 --> 5329.28
making is there something new you're

5328.08 --> 5332.0
trying to point out

5329.28 --> 5332.719
or are you just throwing out the

5332.0 --> 5336.719
darkness

5332.719 --> 5338.32
garbage to make you sick and panicky and

5336.719 --> 5343.04
full of nightmares

5338.32 --> 5345.759999999999
right are you making a habit of

5343.04 --> 5348.159
doing that taking that bucket of [ __ ]

5345.76 --> 5351.1990000000005
up aramanian absolute death

5348.159 --> 5354.4
and torture and then just oh look what i

5351.199 --> 5356.879999999999
got all this [ __ ] up darkness garbage

5354.4 --> 5359.12
oh you want to think about that too all

5356.88 --> 5361.4400000000005
the time

5359.12 --> 5363.5199999999995
you got to be careful with this really

5361.44 --> 5367.839999999999
it's serious

5363.52 --> 5371.360000000001
it's a spell don't get spellbound

5367.84 --> 5373.52
by the darkness it's dangerous

5371.36 --> 5374.96
it's dangerous for your spirit it acts

5373.52 --> 5378.080000000001
if you dwell in there

5374.96 --> 5381.44
it opens up a gate for the dark

5378.08 --> 5385.76
ones to reach you

5381.44 --> 5393.839999999999
mess with you it brings it closer

5385.76 --> 5393.84
be careful

5399.6 --> 5403.360000000001
yeah headway on excluding the stuff

5401.52 --> 5406.639
disappearing beyond the horizon problem

5403.36 --> 5410.88
now there is no problem

5406.639 --> 5413.679
right because things disappear bottom up

5410.88 --> 5414.2390000000005
even when they're measured flat it's

5413.679 --> 5417.76
optics

5414.239 --> 5422.32
it's optics inherent optics separate

5417.76 --> 5426.08
from geometry right geometry is geometry

5422.32 --> 5426.5599999999995
optics is another element it's another

5426.08 --> 5429.28
level

5426.56 --> 5430.4800000000005
it's another dimension you could

5429.28 --> 5432.88
consider

5430.48 --> 5434.159
optics is another dimension from

5432.88 --> 5436.719
geometry

5434.159 --> 5437.679
and in optics not in geometry but in

5436.719 --> 5442.159
optics

5437.679 --> 5445.52
things disappear bottom up they conceal

5442.159 --> 5448.0
because of the optical slant effect

5445.52 --> 5449.1990000000005
because that just happens demonstrably

5448.0 --> 5451.28
however you're going to explain it

5449.199 --> 5453.12
whether it is purely diffraction angular

5451.28 --> 5457.12
resolution limit

5453.12 --> 5460.32
refraction miraging things

5457.12 --> 5463.44
it happens provably so

5460.32 --> 5464.88
every time repeatable empirical it

5463.44 --> 5468.0
happens things disappear

5464.88 --> 5470.400000000001
bottom up the observation height is low

5468.0 --> 5473.84
enough even if the surface

5470.4 --> 5476.96
overlooking is confirmed measured

5473.84 --> 5479.4400000000005
perfectly flat it still happens

5476.96 --> 5480.08
so to claim that things disappear bottom

5479.44 --> 5484.0
up

5480.08 --> 5487.04
is because curvature because of geometry

5484.0 --> 5490.56
blocking things is wrong

5487.04 --> 5493.28
it's wrong it doesn't happen

5490.56 --> 5493.84
there is no geometry to block things

5493.28 --> 5496.8
things

5493.84 --> 5497.679
block themselves the view blocks it

5496.8 --> 5500.639
because of

5497.679 --> 5501.76
optics because of sight and it happens

5500.639 --> 5505.12
always

5501.76 --> 5506.8
if the observation height is low enough

5505.12 --> 5508.719
then over this the surface you're going

5506.8 --> 5513.6
to overlook is going to show

5508.719 --> 5513.6
concealment it happens every single time

5515.36 --> 5522.5599999999995
yeah it does mike jh82

5519.84 --> 5522.56
you're an idiot

5526.88 --> 5533.76
that's right but the geometry

5530.159 --> 5537.36
isn't blocking things on a flat surface

5533.76 --> 5540.400000000001
yet concealment as i call it

5537.36 --> 5541.199
still happens things still disappear

5540.4 --> 5543.599999999999
bottom up

5541.199 --> 5544.638999999999
not because the geometry of the surface

5543.6 --> 5547.76
is in the way

5544.639 --> 5551.92
but because it happens within

5547.76 --> 5555.92
view within optics it always happens

5551.92 --> 5558.159
because it is inherent to seeing

5555.92 --> 5560.32
it is inherent to the process that is

5558.159 --> 5562.638999999999
the result that will come out

5560.32 --> 5565.12
not because there are no straight

5562.639 --> 5567.1990000000005
surfaces

5565.12 --> 5568.88
because the only reason things can

5567.199 --> 5570.96
disappear bottom up

5568.88 --> 5571.92
is because of geometry no that's

5570.96 --> 5575.44
provably

5571.92 --> 5589.84
false because on confirmed flat surfaces

5575.44 --> 5589.839999999999
it still happens

5600.84 --> 5603.84
uh

5608.88 --> 5617.84
all right

5618.96 --> 5622.4
how am i doing today i'm doing fine i'm

5620.719 --> 5624.0
doing much better than yesterday still

5622.4 --> 5628.159
in 80 12.

5624.0 --> 5628.159
i've had a good sleep i've had good food

5628.84 --> 5631.84
yesterday

5632.639 --> 5637.679
i had extra sleep too like after i ended

5635.92 --> 5638.719
my show i went to bed kind of for a

5637.679 --> 5640.639
moment

5638.719 --> 5644.56
and i really needed it because i i just

5640.639 --> 5645.12
felt i literally felt sick and i felt

5644.56 --> 5648.2390000000005
like oh

5645.12 --> 5649.679
[ __ ] like stomach flu sick that's kind

5648.239 --> 5651.36
of the association

5649.679 --> 5653.92
that i originated it's probably

5651.36 --> 5656.839999999999
literally not that

5653.92 --> 5658.4800000000005
but there was a dramatic weather change

5656.84 --> 5661.4400000000005
overnight and

5658.48 --> 5663.599999999999
i just really felt bad i almost threw up

5661.44 --> 5667.04
during the show at one point

5663.6 --> 5669.6
when tensions got kind of high

5667.04 --> 5671.5199999999995
serious that almost happened i know how

5669.6 --> 5673.04
to control it to make that not happen

5671.52 --> 5676.080000000001
but that was how

5673.04 --> 5679.28
bad it was but i recovered i pretty much

5676.08 --> 5682.96
took the entire day to take it easy

5679.28 --> 5686.0
rest take a good shower really clean up

5682.96 --> 5688.719
even i even did some shower therapy

5686.0 --> 5690.239
right like when i did when i was really

5688.719 --> 5692.719
sick last year

5690.239 --> 5693.44
i did that thing really was a perfect

5692.719 --> 5695.92
response

5693.44 --> 5697.599999999999
and that's why today i feel much better

5695.92 --> 5700.719
and

5697.6 --> 5702.96
yeah probably tomorrow it'll be

5700.719 --> 5705.199
like because i still feel remnants of it

5702.96 --> 5708.32
but it's just really under control now

5705.199 --> 5710.719
tomorrow it'll be gone so i handled

5708.32 --> 5713.5199999999995
yesterday well

5710.719 --> 5715.52
and despite being not all that grating

5713.52 --> 5717.6
in my condition

5715.52 --> 5719.52
participated later on the ball busters

5717.6 --> 5729.84
and did really good

5719.52 --> 5729.84
even got compliments from kiwi um

5740.56 --> 5747.679
oh yeah nah don't remove mike

5743.76 --> 5750.400000000001
mike is just a [ __ ]

5747.679 --> 5752.159
he doesn't listen to anything he doesn't

5750.4 --> 5752.879999999999
even know what refraction is and that

5752.159 --> 5757.5199999999995
he's

5752.88 --> 5762.159000000001
like he's already lost in standardized

5757.52 --> 5764.96
[ __ ] tree saying refraction

5762.159 --> 5764.96
refraction

5765.36 --> 5769.839999999999
refraction you mean terrestrial

5768.159 --> 5773.28
refraction seven over six

5769.84 --> 5776.08
r refraction that is a paradox

5773.28 --> 5776.48
because if that terrestrial refraction

5776.08 --> 5779.04
was

5776.48 --> 5780.4
real then you could have never visually

5779.04 --> 5784.239
established the radius

5780.4 --> 5787.04
everything would be warped at all times

5784.239 --> 5787.759999999999
like yeah we do understand you don't

5787.04 --> 5790.32
understand

5787.76 --> 5792.2390000000005
because you're an idiot and you don't

5790.32 --> 5794.48
listen to what flat earthers

5792.239 --> 5795.5199999999995
say about that even though we've been

5794.48 --> 5799.28
repeating it

5795.52 --> 5802.4800000000005
for years every day

5799.28 --> 5803.599999999999
for years and you still didn't listen

5802.48 --> 5805.759999999999
did you

5803.6 --> 5807.84
so now you say oh no we don't understand

5805.76 --> 5810.08
no you don't understand

5807.84 --> 5811.6
you don't understand that you can't use

5810.08 --> 5814.239
terrestrial refraction as an

5811.6 --> 5816.639
excuse because it's a paradox you can

5814.239 --> 5819.119
never prove terrestrial refraction

5816.639 --> 5821.36
because if it existed as suggested you

5819.119 --> 5824.839999999999
could never establish a radius

5821.36 --> 5827.599999999999
in order to construct it also it's

5824.84 --> 5829.84
impossible it's even mathematically

5827.6 --> 5832.400000000001
impossible terrestrial refraction has

5829.84 --> 5834.96
never been utilized

5832.4 --> 5837.04
in a simulation in a ray tracing

5834.96 --> 5840.639
simulation you can't use it

5837.04 --> 5843.28
it's too complicated it's too bizarre it

5840.639 --> 5846.88
can never be made to work realistically

5843.28 --> 5846.88
you can never back engineer

5847.04 --> 5852.96
it's like this you have a realistic view

5851.119 --> 5856.159
we have a landscape that's flat okay

5852.96 --> 5858.88
now you sphericitize it

5856.159 --> 5861.5199999999995
and then apply terrestrial refraction to

5858.88 --> 5863.36
make that geometry within the visual ray

5861.52 --> 5867.360000000001
tracing realm

5863.36 --> 5870.799999999999
turn flat guess what nobody

5867.36 --> 5874.239
has ever succeeded at that nobody

5870.8 --> 5875.28
it's undoable it's impossible to achieve

5874.239 --> 5877.839999999999
that

5875.28 --> 5879.119
right because terrestrial refraction is

5877.84 --> 5881.679
an intangible

5879.119 --> 5883.04
formula the mechanics of it are

5881.679 --> 5885.52
intanable

5883.04 --> 5886.96
you can never simulate it because it's a

5885.52 --> 5890.8
machination

5886.96 --> 5892.4
it's a justified excuse afterward excuse

5890.8 --> 5895.6
because what they always do

5892.4 --> 5898.96
is take a flat surface

5895.6 --> 5902.400000000001
and then sphericitize it

5898.96 --> 5905.76
with spherical geometry r based thinking

5902.4 --> 5908.839999999999
and then make the excuse

5905.76 --> 5912.08
why it doesn't look like the actual

5908.84 --> 5913.92
sphere by saying terrestrial refraction

5912.08 --> 5916.4
so it's just an excuse

5913.92 --> 5917.92
every time they never have to apply it

5916.4 --> 5921.199
because it's impossible

5917.92 --> 5923.36
to apply it you can't use it it's

5921.199 --> 5926.48
impossible to utilize

5923.36 --> 5929.759999999999
you you don't even have a formula you

5926.48 --> 5932.5599999999995
only have the back engineer formula

5929.76 --> 5933.1990000000005
an excuse formula why it looks flat in

5932.56 --> 5936.84
theory

5933.199 --> 5939.5199999999995
you can't actually make a sphere look

5936.84 --> 5941.92
flat with terrestrial refraction

5939.52 --> 5945.679
nobody's ever succeeded at that

5941.92 --> 5949.28
ever it's a machination it doesn't exist

5945.679 --> 5951.04
it's an excuse and if it was real

5949.28 --> 5952.88
then you could have never established

5951.04 --> 5955.44
the radius of earth

5952.88 --> 5956.32
and on top of that the earth would

5955.44 --> 5959.119
probably not

5956.32 --> 5959.5199999999995
look like a sphere it would rather look

5959.119 --> 5962.4
like

5959.52 --> 5967.119000000001
a demisphere and then a tube it would

5962.4 --> 5969.28
not look like the globe you know

5967.119 --> 5971.04
from outer space supposedly right it

5969.28 --> 5974.48
can't look like that it's

5971.04 --> 5977.5199999999995
all of it it's so convoluted

5974.48 --> 5977.5199999999995
so convoluted

5978.84 --> 5982.639
right so

5982.88 --> 5987.36
but nice try yeah blah blah blah oh yeah

5985.199 --> 5989.759999999999
yeah

5987.36 --> 5991.759999999999
mathematical model of your consumer by a

5989.76 --> 5992.159000000001
flat surface well actually that has been

5991.76 --> 5995.4400000000005
done

5992.159 --> 5997.04
within optics it's doable angular

5995.44 --> 6001.599999999999
resolution limit is it

5997.04 --> 6004.4
is a mechanism that can be visualized

6001.6 --> 6004.400000000001
it works out

6005.199 --> 6008.879999999999
right doesn't work out with autographic

6008.159 --> 6012.08
view

6008.88 --> 6014.159000000001
but when you actually apply the more

6012.08 --> 6015.44
optics inherent and not geometry

6014.159 --> 6017.839999999999
inherent

6015.44 --> 6019.199
systems to it that have come out of

6017.84 --> 6023.6
optics research

6019.199 --> 6026.879999999999
you can explain mechanically visually

6023.6 --> 6029.1990000000005
why things do conceal themselves at the

6026.88 --> 6032.88
bottom

6029.199 --> 6033.839999999999
because the visual they can't reach it

6032.88 --> 6037.76
it just

6033.84 --> 6040.8
it can't reach it

6037.76 --> 6044.2390000000005
it's too compacted right

6040.8 --> 6047.679
it's coming from a point a point

6044.239 --> 6052.239
and at some point it just can't

6047.679 --> 6052.2390000000005
can't get there anymore so angular

6052.8 --> 6057.76
the angle is too limited it can't reach

6055.04 --> 6060.48
it anymore so it's going to conceal

6057.76 --> 6060.4800000000005
from the bottom

6063.199 --> 6066.719
it's another topic entirely yeah yeah

6065.52 --> 6070.4800000000005
but it is

6066.719 --> 6070.4800000000005
absolutely part of that effect

6070.639 --> 6074.4800000000005
you can demonstrate that with the

6072.4 --> 6077.92
confirmed flat surfaces

6074.48 --> 6080.159
right that that happens so in the end it

6077.92 --> 6083.28
doesn't even matter

6080.159 --> 6086.5599999999995
if you can't put a formula

6083.28 --> 6089.84
to the bottom up consuming effect it

6086.56 --> 6093.119000000001
happens demonstratedly

6089.84 --> 6093.6
it happens you know it happens because

6093.119 --> 6095.92
you

6093.6 --> 6098.2390000000005
can demonstrate to yourself that it

6095.92 --> 6100.56
happens

6098.239 --> 6100.5599999999995
right

6101.28 --> 6107.5199999999995
so it's established it happens

6104.4 --> 6111.28
even on flat surfaces so what

6107.52 --> 6111.280000000001
is there more to argue about it

6112.32 --> 6116.639
oh you want the formula well stick the

6114.32 --> 6119.84
formula up your ass buddy

6116.639 --> 6121.52
reality is not about formulas right

6119.84 --> 6125.4400000000005
formula is just a

6121.52 --> 6127.52
a tool to oversimplify things to get it

6125.44 --> 6129.599999999999
a little bit more concise in your mind

6127.52 --> 6131.84
of how something's supposed to work

6129.6 --> 6133.04
well i got a formula for you things

6131.84 --> 6135.92
conceal bottom up

6133.04 --> 6137.6
demonstrably with confirmed flat

6135.92 --> 6140.8
surfaces there's your formula

6137.6 --> 6143.52
it's in description form right

6140.8 --> 6146.2390000000005
and it's a description form that you can

6143.52 --> 6149.1990000000005
empirically test for yourself

6146.239 --> 6150.0
right that makes it more about science

6149.199 --> 6154.159
than any

6150.0 --> 6154.159
stupid little formula that you like to

6160.84 --> 6167.119000000001
use

6163.04 --> 6170.719
uh no no you don't know what science is

6167.119 --> 6174.239
your pseudoscience numpty a clown

6170.719 --> 6177.199
as as qe would say it you are one of

6174.239 --> 6179.5199999999995
these clowns

6177.199 --> 6181.44
and i'm already telling you you're going

6179.52 --> 6182.320000000001
to be banned because you're spamming my

6181.44 --> 6185.599999999999
chat with

6182.32 --> 6188.96
absolute atrocious garbage

6185.6 --> 6193.04
you are a scumbag mike you're a scumbag

6188.96 --> 6196.0
liar you are a scumbag liar

6193.04 --> 6197.199
don't give a [ __ ] about what you think

6196.0 --> 6201.679
you can literally

6197.199 --> 6205.678999999999
choke in it you can choke in it

6201.679 --> 6208.4800000000005
you are lying you ignore

6205.679 --> 6209.119
very empirical based evidence that i

6208.48 --> 6211.678999999999
present

6209.119 --> 6214.159
that i explained to you and you want it

6211.679 --> 6216.2390000000005
in formula form well go [ __ ] yourself

6214.159 --> 6219.5199999999995
with your [ __ ] little math

6216.239 --> 6223.5199999999995
obsession you stupid gamma [ __ ]

6219.52 --> 6224.080000000001
liar scumbag you're a lying scumbag and

6223.52 --> 6229.040000000001
now

6224.08 --> 6229.04
you're bad bye piece of [ __ ] go [ __ ]

6230.84 --> 6233.84
yourself

6236.21 --> 6239.43
[Applause]

6244.84 --> 6247.84
right

6258.4 --> 6262.96
my balls block my feet nathan okay

6267.6 --> 6274.400000000001
amanda young you're late because i am

6270.239 --> 6275.28
literally about to round out now came in

6274.4 --> 6277.759999999999
right when i was

6275.28 --> 6279.04
cursing at this stupid ass wipe of a

6277.76 --> 6284.400000000001
baller

6279.04 --> 6284.4
what a wanker lying scumbag

6286.84 --> 6289.84
disgusting

6300.84 --> 6303.84
uh

6306.08 --> 6311.76
right anyway

6309.36 --> 6317.04
still a pretty decent show a lot of talk

6311.76 --> 6320.320000000001
about birds and plants and i don't know

6317.04 --> 6322.48
atrocities and genocide for some reason

6320.32 --> 6325.92
although not in detail specifically

6322.48 --> 6327.44
explaining why not so a lot of esoteric

6325.92 --> 6330.08
stock

6327.44 --> 6331.04
which is yeah fine that's what i do talk

6330.08 --> 6333.199
about a lot

6331.04 --> 6335.119
and i hope that i am being very

6333.199 --> 6337.28
consistent at it because that's very

6335.119 --> 6339.839999999999
important to me

6337.28 --> 6341.5199999999995
i'm trying to in my own way being a bit

6339.84 --> 6343.28
of a yoda here

6341.52 --> 6345.1990000000005
it does really feel like that too

6343.28 --> 6348.639
sometimes it feels like i'm literally

6345.199 --> 6348.638999999999
alone in a giant jungle

6350.08 --> 6359.84
on a jungle planet

6363.36 --> 6372.48
just woke up was hanging out relayed

6365.119 --> 6374.48
yesterday all right all right it's

6372.48 --> 6377.5199999999995
mother's day
