that would be much appreciated

83.52 --> 91.92
so starting a slightly early

87.68 --> 91.92
i don't know keep going back and forth

92.079 --> 99.91999999999999
but yeah it's sunday so you can see this

96.4 --> 100.4
no church like what are they doing with

99.92 --> 104.24000000000001
this

100.4 --> 108.96000000000001
building has been empty literally

104.24 --> 114.399
unused for half a year it's ridiculous

108.96 --> 117.36
anyway yeah the skies are pretty clear

114.399 --> 118.719
there is some well there's a plane

117.36 --> 121.28
flying there but

118.719 --> 123.36
as you can hopefully see it's not really

121.28 --> 126.479
leaving

123.36 --> 129.84
a trail that that stays so it's just

126.479 --> 129.84
gone trailer

130.0 --> 134.64
and there's signs there have been some

133.68 --> 137.20000000000002
of that but

134.64 --> 139.04
very little compared to all that blue

137.2 --> 142.319
sky out there

139.04 --> 145.51999999999998
still yeah a lot of haze very high up

142.319 --> 146.07999999999998
as you can see that is very far away and

145.52 --> 149.92000000000002
probably

146.08 --> 153.04000000000002
very high up in the air

149.92 --> 153.04
it's hazy white

153.2 --> 159.04
but yeah it's very very warm

156.8 --> 161.20000000000002
it's almost yeah it's almost shirtless

159.04 --> 162.959
warm

161.2 --> 165.76
also because yeah there's very little

162.959 --> 168.879
wind so

165.76 --> 170.64
the heat kind of tends to stay

168.879 --> 172.07999999999998
and yeah it was yesterday evening was

170.64 --> 175.04
like that as well

172.08 --> 175.59900000000002
it was like one of the real summer

175.04 --> 179.04
evening

175.599 --> 180.319
where like the sun is like already kind

179.04 --> 182.56
of down

180.319 --> 185.51899999999998
and it's still yeah i'm still just

182.56 --> 188.239
walking basically shirtless outside

185.519 --> 189.59900000000002
on the balcony because it's just still

188.239 --> 191.92000000000002
very hot

189.599 --> 193.76
or warm yeah not hot because that would

191.92 --> 195.92
be unpleasant but just warm

193.76 --> 197.44
so it's really summer here or it was

195.92 --> 199.11999999999998
yesterday

197.44 --> 200.56
and it's probably going to be today as

199.12 --> 204.8
well

200.56 --> 204.8
so anyway i got green tea with me

205.519 --> 212.799
that's it no no coffee with this

209.76 --> 215.84
heat i took the coffee

212.799 --> 216.72
surprisingly well yesterday didn't even

215.84 --> 218.799
get all

216.72 --> 220.0
sweat bursting from it because that does

218.799 --> 223.12
happen when it's very hot

220.0 --> 223.12
i always forget that

224.84 --> 228.64000000000001
yeah right

232.56 --> 240.08
i had a pretty late night i think

237.04 --> 243.92
did make a couple of notes but like

240.08 --> 246.31900000000002
even i had another

243.92 --> 247.2
talk with well it's kind of almost a

246.319 --> 249.76
friend now but

247.2 --> 251.04
yeah my roommate on balcony in like in

249.76 --> 251.92
the middle of the night i don't know

251.04 --> 254.64
what that is but

251.92 --> 257.03999999999996
it seems to happen more often she was

254.64 --> 260.15999999999997
like watching some weird horror movie

257.04 --> 261.84000000000003
it's like half asleep on the couch and

260.16 --> 264.72
that was just so

261.84 --> 265.75899999999996
like wrong and silly to me that i kind

264.72 --> 268.47900000000004
of like

265.759 --> 270.96000000000004
screwed with her and put myself to do it

268.479 --> 270.96
ah

271.68 --> 275.12
and then she like kind of half woke up

274.479 --> 278.8
to that and

275.12 --> 281.199
really freaked out because she was like

278.8 --> 284.72
in this half suspense of disbelief realm

281.199 --> 286.40000000000003
and then seeing me like that totally out

284.72 --> 289.36
of nowhere

286.4 --> 290.15999999999997
like it's your mind doesn't really at

289.36 --> 292.32
that moment

290.16 --> 294.0
make a clear distinction between the

292.32 --> 295.44
movie you're watching and what she was

294.0 --> 299.12
looking at to the side

295.44 --> 303.759
and i know that it was very sneaky of me

299.12 --> 303.759
but i loved it it was funny as [ __ ]

304.0 --> 311.44
and yeah after that we just had another

305.84 --> 314.88
conversation on the balcony and all that

311.44 --> 315.44
all right yeah like if she's somebody's

314.88 --> 317.28
like that

315.44 --> 319.52
i i wouldn't like jump on them or

317.28 --> 320.55999999999995
something that's just brutal that's just

319.52 --> 322.4
evil

320.56 --> 324.56
because then you just startled the [ __ ]

322.4 --> 328.0
out of them in a physical way that's

324.56 --> 329.52
bad i didn't do that it just sat there

328.0 --> 331.68
and then started to make a little bit

329.52 --> 339.52
noise until i thought that

331.68 --> 342.8
until she could hear it

339.52 --> 345.039
i made like this zombie wailing sound as

342.8 --> 345.039
it were

350.479 --> 353.84
it was so funny because i even told her

353.039 --> 357.039
like

353.84 --> 359.19899999999996
yeah you're watching a horror movie like

357.039 --> 360.96
half asleep in the night on the couch

359.199 --> 364.24
really and she's like

360.96 --> 367.35999999999996
no it's not a horror movie and then like

364.24 --> 370.40000000000003
yeah it's netflix and then basically

367.36 --> 371.84000000000003
if you set it on pause like the details

370.4 --> 375.75899999999996
scroll up and it's like

371.84 --> 381.75899999999996
horror thriller like really

375.759 --> 384.8
that's not a horror yeah it is

381.759 --> 387.52000000000004
anyway this is a bit of an

384.8 --> 387.52000000000004
odd person

389.759 --> 396.0
what fun i do feel comfortable like

392.8 --> 398.8
with her in in like next to me

396.0 --> 402.24
she's not as alien to me as like a lot

398.8 --> 402.24
of the other roommates have been

403.52 --> 407.35999999999996
that i just really don't know what to do

405.36 --> 409.039
with me

407.36 --> 411.759
and then i'm like yeah welcome to the

409.039 --> 414.31899999999996
club i don't know i do

411.759 --> 416.24
anyway uh let's go through chat well

414.319 --> 419.36
wait very long for that

416.24 --> 424.319
uh agm was first jung

419.36 --> 424.319
that one guy m rick's j-mac

426.88 --> 430.88
orochimaru all right

431.039 --> 437.759
someone i've locked

434.479 --> 439.52
is a moderator here no that makes no

437.759 --> 441.84000000000003
sense

439.52 --> 441.84
uh

443.52 --> 451.28
robin stanley a man like me

447.919 --> 454.0
man adam meekin good servant

451.28 --> 455.84
gideon's sick eddie bravo fanboy and

454.0 --> 457.919
guns have never owned rmp

455.84 --> 459.84
yeah good to see you all i start a

457.919 --> 463.19899999999996
little early

459.84 --> 465.84
sunday but

463.199 --> 465.84000000000003
plenty of people

467.28 --> 472.08
so i had a pretty late night and

470.24 --> 473.039
yesterday was all about music and it's

472.08 --> 477.35999999999996
all about

473.039 --> 481.52
cleaning [ __ ] up uh

477.36 --> 485.28000000000003
so today i basically progressed further

481.52 --> 487.919
and yeah got like random [ __ ]

485.28 --> 489.84
that was you like stuff that's hard to

487.919 --> 492.96
put in place because it's not like

489.84 --> 493.44
books easily stackable and all that and

492.96 --> 496.0
i kind of

493.44 --> 498.08
managed to just shove it over there and

496.0 --> 501.919
that certainly gave me like

498.08 --> 505.599
a cubic meter of space extra it's like

501.919 --> 507.12
wow my room is suddenly bigger

505.599 --> 509.28
such little things can make such a

507.12 --> 514.0
difference but i'm gonna

509.28 --> 516.959
yeah keep it up and uh actually planning

514.0 --> 517.519
to basically shove some things that i'm

516.959 --> 519.76
just

517.519 --> 522.719
that they're turning out to be really

519.76 --> 525.6
unnecessary for me to have here

522.719 --> 526.0
to just shove that stuff back in storage

525.6 --> 529.2
which

526.0 --> 529.2
still has room for it

529.519 --> 534.72
and then from that vantage point

532.56 --> 535.92
i could basically start working on

534.72 --> 538.9590000000001
getting yeah the

535.92 --> 542.88
uh storage rack in here

538.959 --> 546.8389999999999
yeah i think it would definitely fit

542.88 --> 549.4399999999999
so kind of looking forward to that

546.839 --> 552.5600000000001
uh

549.44 --> 555.7600000000001
right oh yeah flat earth debates the

552.56 --> 558.0799999999999
uh after show premiere

555.76 --> 561.04
was good and it's weird though because i

558.08 --> 564.64
got the sensation like

561.04 --> 565.279
there were literally two premieres

564.64 --> 569.4399999999999
playing

565.279 --> 572.64
that were the same that was so odd

569.44 --> 576.32
it i thought that basically nathan

572.64 --> 578.8
might have accidentally put the same

576.32 --> 580.72
video into two different programs

578.8 --> 582.0799999999999
subsequently i don't know what that was

580.72 --> 584.32
maybe

582.08 --> 586.0
maybe i'm wrong maybe it just happened

584.32 --> 588.9590000000001
to sound exactly alike

586.0 --> 589.279
no but that that wouldn't make any sense

588.959 --> 591.04
but

589.279 --> 592.72
that was a bit weird but yeah it was a

591.04 --> 595.1999999999999
good show anyway

592.72 --> 595.2
and uh

597.2 --> 602.0790000000001
oh yeah yeah more big bear i had a lot

600.16 --> 604.24
of connection issues though which pissed

602.079 --> 607.76
me off it's none of his fault but

604.24 --> 611.36
i think it wasn't just me though

607.76 --> 614.88
it was very weird because as

611.36 --> 617.12
like it was like offline level

614.88 --> 619.92
connection interruption and that

617.12 --> 622.0
happened like three or four times

619.92 --> 623.92
and then it got back on and with one

622.0 --> 626.16
time it took like five minutes before

623.92 --> 629.1999999999999
you got back on

626.16 --> 631.76
and yeah it was still

629.2 --> 633.839
pretty good more of the same the

631.76 --> 638.0
continuation of the idea don't

633.839 --> 641.6
grab lucifer's smoky torch

638.0 --> 644.959
yeah and he owen doesn't seem to

641.6 --> 647.6
say that it just says torch because any

644.959 --> 650.2399999999999
torch is loose for storage now

647.6 --> 651.9200000000001
i uh yeah philosophically fundamentally

650.24 --> 653.6
disagree with that

651.92 --> 655.519
but yeah it's there's always a

653.6 --> 658.0790000000001
consequence but yeah

655.519 --> 659.519
i have learned from way in the past and

658.079 --> 661.279
i don't even know how

659.519 --> 664.399
i don't know how whether this is like

661.279 --> 667.519
spirits that told me or like

664.399 --> 669.76
family relations in a time when i had no

667.519 --> 671.6
idea and it just lingered on in a dream

669.76 --> 673.519
that later on sank in

671.6 --> 675.36
but i'm pretty sure that if lucifer has

673.519 --> 677.2
a torch that he likes people to hold

675.36 --> 680.32
it's a smoky torch

677.2 --> 682.1600000000001
it's a torch that is loud very flashy

680.32 --> 685.12
very interesting looking

682.16 --> 686.079
but it produces smoke and if you if you

685.12 --> 688.079
keep it

686.079 --> 691.12
it starts to smoke things up it makes

688.079 --> 695.519
metaphorically a lot more sense that way

691.12 --> 695.519
right so yeah that's my

695.92 --> 701.4399999999999
i call that that's me sticking my

699.12 --> 703.519
typical nose in business

701.44 --> 705.519
or kind of getting involved like no you

703.519 --> 708.0
have to say this way

705.519 --> 709.12
but yeah that's what i do that's what i

708.0 --> 711.76
always done

709.12 --> 712.5600000000001
i try not to get too uh up front with it

711.76 --> 717.68
but it's just

712.56 --> 720.959
it's a smoky torch i it's a it's fact

717.68 --> 720.959
it's not just the torch

722.48 --> 728.32
right and it's logical because

725.839 --> 731.7600000000001
like even a regular torch an

728.32 --> 734.639
old-fashioned torch they used oil

731.76 --> 736.48
they were smoky yeah if you're like

734.639 --> 738.24
walking in a cave

736.48 --> 739.9200000000001
then you see the light and the smoke is

738.24 --> 741.6
just up there you don't really notice

739.92 --> 745.36
that too much but yeah

741.6 --> 746.24
during the day smokey as [ __ ] this makes

745.36 --> 749.839
more sense

746.24 --> 753.44
see fire brought to humans apollo tor

749.839 --> 756.8800000000001
it oh it's one singular thing

753.44 --> 757.519
it's smoky torch no it's not a massive

756.88 --> 759.4399999999999
doobie

757.519 --> 761.76
it's although you could consider it as

759.44 --> 763.2
such but you could also consider it as

761.76 --> 766.8
lucifer's dick

763.2 --> 771.0400000000001
and the smoke is his pubes

766.8 --> 774.16
right if you are going to

771.04 --> 775.4399999999999
yeah adapt the fractal system to that

774.16 --> 778.079
frequency

775.44 --> 779.2790000000001
which is also a thing that is kind of

778.079 --> 782.16
been going like

779.279 --> 784.0
buildings and yeah you know phallic

782.16 --> 785.8389999999999
thinking

784.0 --> 787.519
all right also love that little old

785.839 --> 790.24
video that he showed

787.519 --> 791.92
just another one of those old ones i

790.24 --> 794.8
think i've seen it before was

791.92 --> 795.68
so funny with with it was just a

794.8 --> 799.4399999999999
heliocentric

795.68 --> 802.079
soup nonsense and it was kind of

799.44 --> 802.72
meant it was ridiculing it it was almost

802.079 --> 806.399
like an

802.72 --> 807.12
open book about the yeah occultic

806.399 --> 810.56
thinkers

807.12 --> 812.32
and what they really yeah they were

810.56 --> 813.92
they were playing with the with the

812.32 --> 816.639
gravity supposedly and

813.92 --> 818.8
all this nonsense animation but they

816.639 --> 821.839
were just making fun of it really

818.8 --> 824.7199999999999
and yeah you could look at it like that

821.839 --> 825.36
they were absolutely like the the main

824.72 --> 828.5600000000001
figures

825.36 --> 831.1990000000001
in it the planets that had faces and all

828.56 --> 832.3199999999999
that and of course saturn had a grappler

831.199 --> 834.639
face

832.32 --> 835.36
it's like undeniable and grabbed their

834.639 --> 839.36
hands

835.36 --> 842.0790000000001
it's very funny right

839.36 --> 842.88
it's like it was pretty undeniable what

842.079 --> 845.8389999999999
that was

842.88 --> 847.519
the esoterics of it but it was

845.839 --> 848.72
interesting to see that in there as well

847.519 --> 851.519
and

848.72 --> 851.519
right after that

854.8 --> 859.4399999999999
that's more music stuff and

860.48 --> 864.639
yeah i haven't really continued to book

862.32 --> 866.88
yet but i'm sure i will

864.639 --> 869.279
because i i got a lot more space and

866.88 --> 870.72
like space in my room is also space in

869.279 --> 873.279
my head

870.72 --> 874.8000000000001
and i'm getting there oh yeah another

873.279 --> 877.76
call with robin stanley basically

874.8 --> 877.76
continuation i

878.399 --> 885.839
yeah we're having some good talks

882.56 --> 885.8389999999999
on a regular basis now

887.36 --> 892.9590000000001
and yeah she does help to bring things

890.24 --> 895.519
into perspective for me a little

892.959 --> 895.5189999999999
it's good

897.44 --> 902.72
like she really managed to basically

900.0 --> 904.8
kindle the old fire

902.72 --> 906.5600000000001
it's like it's not deflate yeah the

904.8 --> 909.92
flame of honor is kind of

906.56 --> 913.3599999999999
it's non-burning flame it's a

909.92 --> 915.92
yeah i've called yeah think of it what

913.36 --> 919.279
you will but i feel it is like a

915.92 --> 921.5999999999999
just a light a non

919.279 --> 922.72
smoky torch and it's inside of me i'm

921.6 --> 926.16
not like

922.72 --> 928.5600000000001
it's just integrated in my being

926.16 --> 929.6
and it didn't get extinguished but i had

928.56 --> 932.4799999999999
used to have

929.6 --> 933.36
and now we're talking about 20 years ago

932.48 --> 936.5600000000001
so much more

933.36 --> 937.6800000000001
fire in me before it all got poisoned as

936.56 --> 940.88
it were

937.68 --> 943.8389999999999
for the terror and

940.88 --> 944.32
yeah like the self-hatred and all that

943.839 --> 947.1990000000001
just

944.32 --> 948.32
became amplified dramatically and i

947.199 --> 951.04
basically

948.32 --> 953.36
lost my momentum because i had a lot of

951.04 --> 956.8
bravery and a lot of like

953.36 --> 959.839
what spy i guess you could call it

956.8 --> 962.8
when i was yeah in it

959.839 --> 963.6800000000001
throughout my late teens into the 20s it

962.8 --> 965.3599999999999
got me into

963.68 --> 967.04
huge problems because yeah

965.36 --> 968.0
underestimating things you know well

967.04 --> 969.8389999999999
that's something that's not

968.0 --> 972.0
going to happen but i kind of want the

969.839 --> 975.1990000000001
fire back

972.0 --> 978.399
because it got extinguished

975.199 --> 982.24
it didn't go fully out but like there

978.399 --> 985.199
it's never really yeah

982.24 --> 986.639
it never really felt safe to really fire

985.199 --> 989.4399999999999
it up again

986.639 --> 992.24
and i want to do it again it's also what

989.44 --> 992.24
brought forth

992.639 --> 997.36
more creative manifestation instead of

995.519 --> 997.68
ideas and being very careful what i used

997.36 --> 1000.399
to do

997.68 --> 1002.2399999999999
is just i saw something in my head and

1000.399 --> 1004.88
then i would do it

1002.24 --> 1005.839
and i didn't even care if it made any

1004.88 --> 1009.519
sense or not i

1005.839 --> 1012.24
just put it there and then later

1009.519 --> 1014.079
try to make sense of it and that yeah

1012.24 --> 1015.759
that's a lot of manifestation

1014.079 --> 1018.56
in that way and that was a great

1015.759 --> 1021.36
advantage of the fire now

1018.56 --> 1022.079
i am a lot older i know a lot more i

1021.36 --> 1025.28
have a more

1022.079 --> 1027.36
distinct insight into the the into the

1025.28 --> 1030.48
reality and the structure of things

1027.36 --> 1034.559
so such a creative burst would

1030.48 --> 1037.199
not such energy would not result in just

1034.559 --> 1038.8799999999999
random nonsense as it would have 20

1037.199 --> 1041.439
years ago no it would actually

1038.88 --> 1042.959
probably drive a lot of really heavy

1041.439 --> 1046.24
projects

1042.959 --> 1046.24
that's why i want it back

1046.4 --> 1049.919
and i'm getting it back partially

1048.24 --> 1051.84
through the music

1049.919 --> 1055.679
which is exactly the same music that i

1051.84 --> 1055.6789999999999
was listening 20 years ago as well

1055.76 --> 1059.6
and i'm kind of like taking another

1061.2 --> 1066.0
it's so funny if you get yeah maybe this

1064.559 --> 1068.24
is getting kind of boring to some people

1066.0 --> 1069.039
it's metaphorical but you know i've

1068.24 --> 1072.08
played

1069.039 --> 1075.2
the games polish gate welders gate 2 and

1072.08 --> 1078.32
like the full works played it probably

1075.2 --> 1081.1200000000001
over a thousand times now

1078.32 --> 1081.9189999999999
it's insane at the game i've played the

1081.12 --> 1083.9189999999999
most

1081.919 --> 1085.2800000000002
of everything and i've played some games

1083.919 --> 1087.679
insane amounts

1085.28 --> 1088.72
i played so much civilization five i

1087.679 --> 1092.0
played so

1088.72 --> 1094.559
much doom too so much back in the day

1092.0 --> 1096.559
but it's just incomparable

1094.559 --> 1097.84
to just the glory of baldur's gate and

1096.559 --> 1100.0
how many times it played through

1097.84 --> 1101.84
mostly because of the music that's what

1100.0 --> 1103.919
i realize in retrospect because of the

1101.84 --> 1104.48
music and how well it is attuned to the

1103.919 --> 1106.8400000000001
story

1104.48 --> 1108.72
i'm starting to notice even better

1106.84 --> 1112.1599999999999
patterns

1108.72 --> 1115.84
because of how

1112.16 --> 1119.28
there is the how the story was designed

1115.84 --> 1122.8799999999999
and this is magnificent this is

1119.28 --> 1125.9189999999999
i've kind of discovered the true

1122.88 --> 1129.3600000000001
legendary game master power

1125.919 --> 1133.2
of the months that made the story

1129.36 --> 1136.799
and that is that every location

1133.2 --> 1140.4
has a culture a style and that and

1136.799 --> 1142.4
a correlating musical theme

1140.4 --> 1143.6000000000001
they did that and they did it really

1142.4 --> 1147.039
well in the game

1143.6 --> 1149.52
and there is like the the maker of it is

1147.039 --> 1152.24
very good in

1149.52 --> 1153.44
tension building in music is very

1152.24 --> 1156.08
exciting and

1153.44 --> 1156.88
scary music but like really serious like

1156.08 --> 1160.96
not like ooh

1156.88 --> 1164.5590000000002
spooky no really tense suspenseful

1160.96 --> 1167.679
and the thing is he managed to

1164.559 --> 1171.9189999999999
get a linear build up

1167.679 --> 1174.48
of your character growing

1171.919 --> 1174.96
getting more confrontations in the world

1174.48 --> 1176.559
getting

1174.96 --> 1178.32
more experience more powerful more

1176.559 --> 1181.9189999999999
connections more fame

1178.32 --> 1185.84
and how the world responds

1181.919 --> 1186.48
to the character is translated into

1185.84 --> 1189.039
music

1186.48 --> 1190.16
it's amazing it's mind-blowing once i

1189.039 --> 1193.2
see that

1190.16 --> 1194.3200000000002
like like there is you can of course do

1193.2 --> 1196.48
a lot of things make

1194.32 --> 1197.36
choices personal choices take this

1196.48 --> 1199.84
person on

1197.36 --> 1200.7199999999998
kill him whatever that but basically the

1199.84 --> 1203.1999999999998
storyline is

1200.72 --> 1205.679
pretty straightforward it's like okay

1203.2 --> 1208.96
you got a little sandbox in this

1205.679 --> 1210.48
in this scenario and then yeah you can

1208.96 --> 1211.919
do this question you could do this quest

1210.48 --> 1213.76
in that quest or you could do it in

1211.919 --> 1215.919
another order or you can skip summit

1213.76 --> 1217.76
then you go to the next scene

1215.919 --> 1218.96
and then once you have that happens you

1217.76 --> 1220.72
can never go back

1218.96 --> 1222.96
that if you can even go back to that

1220.72 --> 1224.96
literal location in the game map

1222.96 --> 1227.039
it'll be a different map it'll be a new

1224.96 --> 1228.24
load and things would have changed and

1227.039 --> 1230.08
maybe

1228.24 --> 1231.84
also adapted to what you've done in the

1230.08 --> 1232.559
previous setting of the map it's pretty

1231.84 --> 1235.1999999999998
complicated

1232.559 --> 1236.8799999999999
for the is what they've done that's like

1235.2 --> 1239.3600000000001
mind-boggling work

1236.88 --> 1240.5590000000002
like the amount of registry for that's

1239.36 --> 1243.6
just

1240.559 --> 1244.72
absurd it's like a bureaucratic

1243.6 --> 1248.08
nightmare

1244.72 --> 1250.72
like paperwork but in digital form

1248.08 --> 1252.72
but the build up is pretty

1250.72 --> 1255.2
straightforward and the natural

1252.72 --> 1257.76
consequences of the level you increase

1255.2 --> 1258.799
and also what you have done they just

1257.76 --> 1260.1589999999999
naturally

1258.799 --> 1262.1589999999999
integrated like okay you're going to do

1260.159 --> 1263.7600000000002
this then rumors are going to spread

1262.159 --> 1266.0
this is how the people will start to

1263.76 --> 1267.52
feel for somebody in politics and the

1266.0 --> 1269.2
distance may take notice because of

1267.52 --> 1270.24
these rumors and kind of change the

1269.2 --> 1273.6000000000001
stance

1270.24 --> 1276.64
and the music ever is basically

1273.6 --> 1279.76
going along with the linear build up and

1276.64 --> 1284.4
has like the man who wrote it he

1279.76 --> 1286.96
really knew the story he really knew it

1284.4 --> 1290.0
and you can hear it in the music that it

1286.96 --> 1294.32
it's so well adapted it's a masterpiece

1290.0 --> 1297.919
beyond just the music

1294.32 --> 1300.799
by itself right

1297.919 --> 1300.7990000000002
so yeah

1302.24 --> 1306.0
it needed to put that down yeah rob and

1304.32 --> 1308.8799999999999
stanley understand i talk a lot more

1306.0 --> 1310.72
about this [ __ ] to her

1308.88 --> 1312.7990000000002
that's why he constantly have two hour

1310.72 --> 1316.4
talks or four hours

1312.799 --> 1316.4
but i've realized that it's just

1317.6 --> 1324.1589999999999
pretty impressive and

1321.039 --> 1327.28
give me a clear sign as to yeah what

1324.159 --> 1330.8400000000001
if i would want to somehow it

1327.28 --> 1334.6399999999999
eventually reproduce such glory i

1330.84 --> 1336.72
must kind of replicate it

1334.64 --> 1338.0800000000002
in another with other themes other

1336.72 --> 1340.24
styles but i have to

1338.08 --> 1342.8799999999999
understand that same thing and take it

1340.24 --> 1346.64
as seriously and basically put the music

1342.88 --> 1350.48
on the top on the top of the entire game

1346.64 --> 1354.0800000000002
music priority number one

1350.48 --> 1355.44
you know potent like the music maker has

1354.08 --> 1358.8799999999999
to be

1355.44 --> 1361.679
really really good compared to

1358.88 --> 1363.0390000000002
everything else well the if everything

1361.679 --> 1365.1200000000001
else is good it's good

1363.039 --> 1366.64
but it's not as important that that's

1365.12 --> 1369.28
gonna be my

1366.64 --> 1371.039
angle too if i'm ever gonna get real in

1369.28 --> 1373.36
a game

1371.039 --> 1374.1589999999999
i always wanted to but yeah the world

1373.36 --> 1378.6399999999999
didn't really

1374.159 --> 1383.2800000000002
i think anyway

1378.64 --> 1386.8400000000001
yeah yeah robin has kind of

1383.28 --> 1392.24
kindled the flame again with that

1386.84 --> 1392.24
and the music is helping a lot

1392.48 --> 1396.159
although yeah it's also very hot and

1395.2 --> 1398.4
when i get a lot

1396.159 --> 1400.8400000000001
very when i get a lot of enthusiasm i

1398.4 --> 1402.24
also get more sweaty so that's kind of

1400.84 --> 1403.9189999999999
annoying

1402.24 --> 1406.159
but yeah you can't have everything your

1403.919 --> 1406.159
way

1409.12 --> 1413.28
also yeah i did watch back my entire

1411.6 --> 1416.48
hangout yesterday

1413.28 --> 1416.96
and i left that comment and i said and i

1416.48 --> 1419.52
yeah

1416.96 --> 1422.08
i am standing by that comment it was

1419.52 --> 1424.559
probably the best hangout i did

1422.08 --> 1424.559
to date

1425.36 --> 1430.7199999999998
like i thought it was perfect like

1428.32 --> 1433.6789999999999
everything i did was just exactly

1430.72 --> 1434.64
how i wanted it even like the detail

1433.679 --> 1438.4
responses and

1434.64 --> 1441.5200000000002
how i didn't respond and yeah

1438.4 --> 1445.44
very proud of that also yeah it was

1441.52 --> 1449.039
good to kind of as an observer watch

1445.44 --> 1452.799
my drawings and all that it's

1449.039 --> 1455.52
yeah yeah you know i i rarely

1452.799 --> 1456.8799999999999
look at it like that when i'm looking at

1455.52 --> 1459.9189999999999
my drawings

1456.88 --> 1461.7600000000002
like in the 3d like not on screen

1459.919 --> 1463.44
it's always like okay this is my thing

1461.76 --> 1464.72
what's this supposed to represent does

1463.44 --> 1466.88
it represent that idea

1464.72 --> 1469.2
accurately enough and that's kind of

1466.88 --> 1472.3200000000002
like the only criteria i see it

1469.2 --> 1473.8400000000001
with with my eyes and i don't realize

1472.32 --> 1476.8799999999999
like what is the personal

1473.84 --> 1479.6789999999999
impact of somebody else

1476.88 --> 1479.679
seeing it

1480.64 --> 1486.5590000000002
and i kind of tried to do that a little

1484.48 --> 1487.76
yesterday and yeah it was really good it

1486.559 --> 1490.96
was a good show and i

1487.76 --> 1491.76
named it glad i put like the flat earth

1490.96 --> 1493.3600000000001
models in there

1491.76 --> 1495.039
it's a big challenge you know it's like

1493.36 --> 1497.1999999999998
oh a lot of triggering

1495.039 --> 1498.48
but that's supposed to be because it's i

1497.2 --> 1500.64
want everyone

1498.48 --> 1501.919
to see that and it's going to be a

1500.64 --> 1503.279
anchor point it's going to be a

1501.919 --> 1506.4
reference point for me

1503.279 --> 1507.679
people ask me about my models that's the

1506.4 --> 1510.88
hangout to point at

1507.679 --> 1510.88
it's 602

1512.159 --> 1517.5200000000002
flat earth early bird 602 that's the one

1514.96 --> 1520.4
that's the one you point at

1517.52 --> 1521.84
and i've explained so much in that

1520.4 --> 1526.5590000000002
entire hangout

1521.84 --> 1529.12
so many directions really fascinating

1526.559 --> 1532.96
like even the whole oil talk was just

1529.12 --> 1532.9599999999998
interesting to also get that in there

1537.76 --> 1541.36
[Music]

1539.12 --> 1542.2399999999998
right and of course i got good sponsored

1541.36 --> 1545.9189999999999
[ __ ]

1542.24 --> 1549.36
like that's yeah i know it always does

1545.919 --> 1549.3600000000001
give me a little extra boost

1549.84 --> 1553.6789999999999
but maybe it's just a weird correlation

1552.64 --> 1555.6000000000001
it's like

1553.679 --> 1558.799
sometimes i feel like they feel it

1555.6 --> 1561.279
coming and then they do it

1558.799 --> 1561.279
i don't know

1569.36 --> 1572.4799999999998
needs a muffler what

1574.559 --> 1579.84
anyway i'm gonna look through chat what

1576.799 --> 1579.84
you guys are talking about

1583.039 --> 1587.44
firmament of the mind yeah

1590.159 --> 1595.679
firma meant the firm

1596.84 --> 1603.12
mind

1599.52 --> 1603.12
i thought that was a really interesting

1610.84 --> 1613.84
insight

1614.08 --> 1621.6
all right did i i'm not sure

1618.4 --> 1621.6000000000001
did i also have a

1622.24 --> 1627.039
a skype conversation with good servant

1624.84 --> 1629.36
before

1627.039 --> 1632.96
i had it with robin stanley i'm not sure

1629.36 --> 1634.7199999999998
or if it was just chat i don't remember

1632.96 --> 1636.24
there were some things that we needed to

1634.72 --> 1638.559
discuss i don't

1636.24 --> 1641.1200000000001
remember if we actually video called or

1638.559 --> 1644.559
something or

1641.12 --> 1644.559
or if it was just text

1645.039 --> 1652.799
iron was acting like an old grumpy

1648.96 --> 1652.799
gotcha what the hell is that does that

1652.84 --> 1655.84
mean

1666.84 --> 1669.84
what

1674.64 --> 1680.8400000000001
whoa damn dude

1677.76 --> 1684.24
you got kids

1680.84 --> 1697.84
23 years apart

1684.24 --> 1697.84
poof nothing busy

1699.12 --> 1706.6399999999999
reminds me of an old wise man well

1703.2 --> 1706.64
i'm not that old yet

1707.12 --> 1710.559
but thanks for the compliment mark

1708.84 --> 1713.6789999999999
hollard

1710.559 --> 1716.32
i do feel very old though

1713.679 --> 1716.3200000000002
sometimes

1717.36 --> 1722.32
or stretched and that's funny because

1720.0 --> 1724.0
very old people sometimes describe it as

1722.32 --> 1726.1589999999999
stretched and when they say that it's

1724.0 --> 1728.32
just like hey that sounds familiar

1726.159 --> 1732.0
that's kind of what it feels like to me

1728.32 --> 1734.559
although despite that sensation

1732.0 --> 1735.36
it's still there's so much youth still

1734.559 --> 1738.399
in it

1735.36 --> 1740.799
it's just that it was probably more

1738.399 --> 1741.84
and became stretched but it was too much

1740.799 --> 1745.36
it's like

1741.84 --> 1745.9189999999999
too much spark you know couldn't handle

1745.36 --> 1750.0
it

1745.919 --> 1753.6000000000001
now i can in the frequency it is at now

1750.0 --> 1755.52
i i can wield it now i i i'm

1753.6 --> 1756.8799999999999
i'm in a phase of my life when i can

1755.52 --> 1759.84
finally

1756.88 --> 1761.679
constructively properly wield my inner

1759.84 --> 1765.279
power to

1761.679 --> 1768.3100000000002
to the to its potential and i don't even

1765.279 --> 1771.279
know how far that is

1768.31 --> 1774.24
[Music]

1771.279 --> 1776.96
but i know that's i just know it that

1774.24 --> 1776.96
that's the case

1778.159 --> 1783.2
oh you're what you're 40 mark collard i

1781.2 --> 1784.64
thought you were

1783.2 --> 1788.32
oh wait i think i mixed you up with

1784.64 --> 1791.0700000000002
somebody else then with the age thing

1788.32 --> 1792.8799999999999
huh okay so you're 42. i didn't know

1791.07 --> 1795.279
[Music]

1792.88 --> 1797.6000000000001
i thought you were like 50 or something

1795.279 --> 1797.6
okay

1798.48 --> 1804.0
cleary you're still a youngster

1801.52 --> 1804.96
29 ah it's so funny for me to say that

1804.0 --> 1809.84
about people

1804.96 --> 1809.8400000000001
like you're such a little kid 29

1813.2 --> 1820.559
well i've had people that were

1816.72 --> 1823.919
younger than me look at me and think

1820.559 --> 1826.8799999999999
that i am younger than them

1823.919 --> 1830.0800000000002
right that has happened in my life it's

1826.88 --> 1832.96
really funny when that happens

1830.08 --> 1836.08
yeah yeah technically my my roommate

1832.96 --> 1840.48
thought that i was younger than her

1836.08 --> 1845.84
she thought i was like 25 and i'm like

1840.48 --> 1845.84
whoa whoa thanks

1846.32 --> 1852.399
oh everybody's sharing their age now

1850.0 --> 1852.399
all right

1856.88 --> 1860.3200000000002
you don't look your age at all i don't

1858.64 --> 1863.2
know how you look

1860.32 --> 1864.0
oh it's tall i look mid-20s i haven't

1863.2 --> 1867.679
seen anything

1864.0 --> 1867.679
from you picture

1869.44 --> 1873.039
so you're leaving us guessing in that

1873.84 --> 1878.9599999999998
i look like a young artist or musician

1875.919 --> 1882.64
oh sure

1878.96 --> 1885.519
yeah i'll get on that stage and

1882.64 --> 1885.519
be the singer

1888.08 --> 1891.12
i would do it now you know 20 years ago

1890.64 --> 1894.88
i would

1891.12 --> 1898.32
[ __ ] my pants at the idea of it yeah i

1894.88 --> 1900.5590000000002
i went on a stage once and held the bass

1898.32 --> 1901.9189999999999
a bass guitar and it was really stoned

1900.559 --> 1904.48
out of my mind and it

1901.919 --> 1906.3990000000001
did a really basic thing and i did it

1904.48 --> 1908.72
okay but it was so basic that it kind of

1906.399 --> 1911.5189999999998
was embarrassing

1908.72 --> 1913.44
but because it was just so shitty

1911.519 --> 1916.24
[ __ ] my pants from all that

1913.44 --> 1917.6000000000001
now i don't know everything's changed

1916.24 --> 1921.6
around so much

1917.6 --> 1923.6789999999999
it's so much different that this point

1921.6 --> 1924.6399999999999
like i wouldn't be afraid to get on the

1923.679 --> 1928.0
stage

1924.64 --> 1928.88
it's just that it depends on what stage

1928.0 --> 1931.44
it is and what

1928.88 --> 1933.519
the people are and i will know that i

1931.44 --> 1935.2
will not be mystified by it it's not

1933.519 --> 1937.1200000000001
going to be a mystery

1935.2 --> 1939.679
oh i'm going to have to take a step in

1937.12 --> 1942.2399999999998
the deep no i can just size it up

1939.679 --> 1943.76
and then no this is exactly the stage i

1942.24 --> 1944.96
want to get onto and i will not be

1943.76 --> 1946.64
afraid or

1944.96 --> 1949.039
i could get on this but people are not

1946.64 --> 1951.279
going to understand so it's not use

1949.039 --> 1953.36
i know that now how it works i can feel

1951.279 --> 1957.039
it

1953.36 --> 1960.24
and yeah i the stage fright i guess

1957.039 --> 1962.72
is gone and i think that probably also

1960.24 --> 1965.6
doing my show helped a lot

1962.72 --> 1966.3990000000001
it did because you know i was already

1965.6 --> 1969.6
like

1966.399 --> 1971.6
kind of over it most of the part

1969.6 --> 1972.799
compared to like 20 years ago when i

1971.6 --> 1975.6789999999999
started but

1972.799 --> 1978.24
yeah if i started four years ago i still

1975.679 --> 1983.1200000000001
had some stage fright but it was nothing

1978.24 --> 1985.919
as it was like 15 20 years before that

1983.12 --> 1988.0
and now i think that the last remnants

1985.919 --> 1992.24
of it are just gone it's

1988.0 --> 1994.96
it's just been replaced by oh good i

1992.24 --> 1996.08
great i'm gonna have a lot of eyes on me

1994.96 --> 1999.44
and that's

1996.08 --> 2001.36
yeah like oh great now i have to put it

1999.44 --> 2003.679
more out in the open that i'm basically

2001.36 --> 2007.4399999999998
rejecting the entire world

2003.679 --> 2007.44
that's what i'm gonna be thinking

2008.08 --> 2010.799
but yeah

2012.48 --> 2016.08
yeah it depends on what i have to do on

2014.64 --> 2020.5590000000002
stage you know if i'm gonna have to

2016.08 --> 2020.559
bring communicate some message or

2020.799 --> 2024.99
yeah that if it's just improvising on

2023.919 --> 2027.1200000000001
stage you

2024.99 --> 2032.72
[Music]

2027.12 --> 2035.84
i don't know

2032.72 --> 2038.24
ladies and gentlemen distinguished yes

2035.84 --> 2038.24
they do

2041.679 --> 2047.8400000000001
whoa you were born in a hurricane

2050.72 --> 2061.839
out of the woman into the storm

2072.839 --> 2075.839
hmm

2087.839 --> 2094.24
you're a smart one but

2091.119 --> 2097.76
i do agree there's a lot of like really

2094.24 --> 2101.04
nice women and ladies in my chat

2097.76 --> 2105.28
i do appreciate every one of them and

2101.04 --> 2108.32
i don't know why that is i guess that

2105.28 --> 2111.3590000000004
the other because i have met

2108.32 --> 2114.2400000000002
some flat earth ladies

2111.359 --> 2115.04
that really i don't know didn't like

2114.24 --> 2116.4799999999996
hate him or

2115.04 --> 2118.24
like dislike him but it's just they

2116.48 --> 2121.76
didn't really appeal to me and they

2118.24 --> 2123.839
don't seem to hang around you know

2121.76 --> 2127.6800000000003
it's it's it's funny how that works out

2123.839 --> 2127.68
it's almost like an instinctive thing

2128.0 --> 2131.28
they just hang in other places and i

2129.599 --> 2133.599
typically don't like to hang around

2131.28 --> 2133.599
there

2135.839 --> 2145.839
but yeah

2147.2 --> 2149.4399999999996
hmm

2153.2 --> 2163.5989999999997
what rebel can work

2157.76 --> 2163.599
at or what what do you mean gideon's

2170.839 --> 2173.839
sick

2175.2 --> 2180.3199999999997
oh you're still talking about the stage

2177.599 --> 2183.44
setup right yeah i did kind of like

2180.32 --> 2186.4
rush that through but yeah the whole

2183.44 --> 2188.16
rebel attitude it's not really a rebel

2186.4 --> 2189.2000000000003
attitude you know because a rebel

2188.16 --> 2193.1189999999997
attitude is like

2189.2 --> 2195.359
a social attitude it's like a stereotype

2193.119 --> 2198.48
that people can appeal to to like

2195.359 --> 2200.4
identify you as an icon and

2198.48 --> 2201.76
to put it into a contact that's not what

2200.4 --> 2205.44
i was talking about now it's

2201.76 --> 2208.6400000000003
it's much more spiritually impersonal

2205.44 --> 2210.2400000000002
it's just that in that moment instead of

2208.64 --> 2212.0
being like oh no what are they gonna

2210.24 --> 2214.8799999999997
think i'm just gonna be like

2212.0 --> 2216.56
oh right yeah yeah yeah most most people

2214.88 --> 2218.48
are [ __ ] retards and it's probably

2216.56 --> 2221.2799999999997
going to be pointless

2218.48 --> 2221.599
but i'm doing this because i need to do

2221.28 --> 2226.8390000000004
it

2221.599 --> 2229.52
and it's not yeah it's it's like

2226.839 --> 2232.7999999999997
sometimes

2229.52 --> 2233.2
it's almost when something has to be

2232.8 --> 2235.599
said

2233.2 --> 2237.1189999999997
it's not even that it's heard it's just

2235.599 --> 2240.2400000000002
that it's said

2237.119 --> 2242.56
and then god hears it or

2240.24 --> 2243.359
through the other dimension the message

2242.56 --> 2245.119
is heard

2243.359 --> 2247.359
whether there were people physically

2245.119 --> 2249.6800000000003
listening to it

2247.359 --> 2251.2
yeah maybe a little mystical like that

2249.68 --> 2255.2799999999997
but

2251.2 --> 2259.68
i believe in that i do

2255.28 --> 2263.3590000000004
i've said a lot of like profound things

2259.68 --> 2267.04
to a handful of people very long ago

2263.359 --> 2267.5989999999997
like 30 years ago in like very mystical

2267.04 --> 2269.44
moments

2267.599 --> 2271.76
and it's kind of that all those things

2269.44 --> 2274.56
have started to become true

2271.76 --> 2275.119
and they were like a prophecy to me

2274.56 --> 2277.04
because it

2275.119 --> 2279.599
it's like a prediction that came out of

2277.04 --> 2281.68
nowhere

2279.599 --> 2285.839
and it's like like a prophecy was being

2281.68 --> 2285.839
dropped on me at the time

2291.2 --> 2295.04
what's what is it

2293.19 --> 2299.839
[Music]

2295.04 --> 2299.839
10 years old holy [ __ ]

2304.0 --> 2308.72
oh god that's terrible man

2307.2 --> 2310.839
oh yeah by the way thank you good

2308.72 --> 2313.839
servant for the dollar super chat

2310.839 --> 2313.839
donation

2324.839 --> 2327.839
oh

2328.72 --> 2331.9199999999996
all right stage on stage what is it

2331.119 --> 2336.8
talking about

2331.92 --> 2336.8
good kind of sidetrack uh

2336.88 --> 2341.44
right it was about the rebel it's not

2339.76 --> 2344.6400000000003
that i'm gonna be like

2341.44 --> 2346.48
a rebel i'm not going along with that

2344.64 --> 2348.48
i'm gonna be the contrarian in my

2346.48 --> 2351.04
attitude and that's very familiar

2348.48 --> 2352.8
a lot of people have been programmed

2351.04 --> 2355.2799999999997
with that as an icon and they will be

2352.8 --> 2357.119
like oh okay it's gonna be like that

2355.28 --> 2359.52
well that's not what i meant what i

2357.119 --> 2361.92
meant is just pure inside of me and it's

2359.52 --> 2361.92
gonna be

2362.079 --> 2368.48
what i need to basically dispel

2365.92 --> 2370.2400000000002
subtle panic from unfolding and making

2368.48 --> 2374.64
me do things

2370.24 --> 2377.2799999999997
basically like oh right right don't

2374.64 --> 2378.0
try to imagine like it's really

2377.28 --> 2381.0400000000004
important

2378.0 --> 2382.16
in the moment to how the people will

2381.04 --> 2384.24
respond

2382.16 --> 2385.52
because as i explain after that it's not

2384.24 --> 2388.3999999999996
about that it's about

2385.52 --> 2388.8
that it is being said in the right way

2388.4 --> 2390.4
and

2388.8 --> 2393.2000000000003
it doesn't even matter if the people are

2390.4 --> 2395.839
listening that are physically there

2393.2 --> 2397.4399999999996
it's said correctly it will echo on

2395.839 --> 2399.7599999999998
through the other dimensions

2397.44 --> 2401.76
through the fourth dimension it will be

2399.76 --> 2405.3590000000004
heard by god

2401.76 --> 2407.599
and creation and i firmly believe in

2405.359 --> 2407.5989999999997
that

2407.68 --> 2411.44
you know if some it's like magic it's

2409.68 --> 2414.16
like a spell if it's said

2411.44 --> 2415.28
right pure with the exact frequency and

2414.16 --> 2419.2
the exact timing

2415.28 --> 2422.1600000000003
fully natural it will

2419.2 --> 2423.52
do something whether there is somebody

2422.16 --> 2426.56
there to hear it

2423.52 --> 2427.68
or not although if somebody is at least

2426.56 --> 2430.96
listening if there's

2427.68 --> 2433.52
people expecting to listen

2430.96 --> 2434.8
not necessarily having such an

2433.52 --> 2438.079
expectation

2434.8 --> 2442.319
then there is a line of energy flowing

2438.079 --> 2442.319
that does tend to kind of amplify the

2442.4 --> 2447.76
the intensity but that's about all

2446.0 --> 2449.92
and therefore it can work with one

2447.76 --> 2452.4
person this is what i'm doing a lot

2449.92 --> 2454.4
talking one-on-one and they know it

2452.4 --> 2456.0
robin stanley knows this probably more

2454.4 --> 2459.28
than most now

2456.0 --> 2461.76
other people too that yeah i

2459.28 --> 2462.96
i throw out like it's like it's a

2461.76 --> 2466.079
glorious speech

2462.96 --> 2469.04
i'm putting down some real [ __ ] in in

2466.079 --> 2470.319
my communication and it's talking to god

2469.04 --> 2473.52
basically

2470.319 --> 2473.52
and she even yeah

2474.0 --> 2480.0
she kind of even told me

2477.119 --> 2482.0
that she recognized that it's it's so

2480.0 --> 2483.44
mystical and it makes me feel like yes

2482.0 --> 2488.88
i'm a proper part

2483.44 --> 2488.88
of of the creator's plan i have a

2492.839 --> 2495.839
purpose

2506.8 --> 2510.2400000000002
right so yeah that that was the whole

2509.359 --> 2512.48
rebel

2510.24 --> 2515.359
on stage you know and it is a way you

2512.48 --> 2515.359
know if you

2516.24 --> 2519.52
if you think it's going to be too hard

2518.079 --> 2522.0
to not fall

2519.52 --> 2524.0
into a typical stereotype in order to

2522.0 --> 2525.44
connect more with the general public

2524.0 --> 2527.839
you're facing in a speech

2525.44 --> 2529.28
or whatever you're gonna do then yeah

2527.839 --> 2532.0
yeah do it

2529.28 --> 2533.599
but you have to realize that doing that

2532.0 --> 2536.4
also

2533.599 --> 2540.079
will cut down on more personal details

2536.4 --> 2543.28
that will not fit very well

2540.079 --> 2544.1600000000003
now i despite not falling into a

2543.28 --> 2548.0
stereotype

2544.16 --> 2551.2799999999997
even in my natural form do that

2548.0 --> 2554.72
because i have like all the traits

2551.28 --> 2556.96
that stem from my childhood

2554.72 --> 2556.9599999999996
that

2558.0 --> 2563.839
were designated for something else

2561.359 --> 2564.72
or like that could have turned into that

2563.839 --> 2568.48
and

2564.72 --> 2570.8799999999997
it didn't it never will and therefore

2568.48 --> 2572.96
it's there but it's very personal it's

2570.88 --> 2573.6800000000003
more it'll more be shown in moments

2572.96 --> 2575.839
where i do

2573.68 --> 2577.68
actually for example share my panic or

2575.839 --> 2580.96
my extreme grief

2577.68 --> 2583.68
and not in public but

2580.96 --> 2584.319
when yeah when i am doing public talk

2583.68 --> 2587.44
there is

2584.319 --> 2588.48
things that i'm basically scrubbing from

2587.44 --> 2591.52
my person

2588.48 --> 2595.119
entirely like fully conscious

2591.52 --> 2596.88
and yeah i want that i wanted never

2595.119 --> 2600.4
wanted it in the first place

2596.88 --> 2603.2000000000003
you know as a kid is okay but i kept it

2600.4 --> 2604.48
and i thought i needed it for delusional

2603.2 --> 2607.2799999999997
reasons i thought

2604.48 --> 2609.44
i was like a purist in like natural

2607.28 --> 2611.8390000000004
arriving character

2609.44 --> 2612.8
i had weird social engineering ideas

2611.839 --> 2617.599
about myself

2612.8 --> 2620.079
even and it was

2617.599 --> 2622.079
yeah i just learned over time now by

2620.079 --> 2623.2000000000003
confrontation with logos by being

2622.079 --> 2626.6400000000003
confronted

2623.2 --> 2628.24
through my 3d not through my ideas and

2626.64 --> 2630.8799999999997
visions but through my personal

2628.24 --> 2635.839
experience that

2630.88 --> 2635.839
that was a mistake

2636.4 --> 2642.8
yeah so

2639.599 --> 2645.119
right getting a bit convoluted now but

2642.8 --> 2646.319
there's all yeah there's some things

2645.119 --> 2649.2000000000003
yeah you should never just

2646.319 --> 2651.599
show yourself completely raw on stage

2649.2 --> 2653.5989999999997
like that

2651.599 --> 2655.119
you could do it but then you will be

2653.599 --> 2656.88
considered an eccentric

2655.119 --> 2659.6800000000003
after that point with all the

2656.88 --> 2664.8
consequences that come with it

2659.68 --> 2664.7999999999997
i don't do that no i'm here to

2668.48 --> 2672.16
to perform speech to

2672.72 --> 2678.24
to strengthen the message to strengthen

2675.68 --> 2681.839
the spirit

2678.24 --> 2685.04
to help

2681.839 --> 2688.96
with what i do and i adapt

2685.04 --> 2688.96
my person to it

2689.2 --> 2691.839
right

2693.359 --> 2698.72
but i don't discontort myself

2696.64 --> 2700.7999999999997
you know if i wasn't naturally able to

2698.72 --> 2704.319
do that then i wouldn't do it

2700.8 --> 2707.119
but it yeah i'm compulsive

2704.319 --> 2709.2799999999997
always kind of have been like it's like

2707.119 --> 2712.1600000000003
one of the few things that actually does

2709.28 --> 2712.1600000000003
make me happy

2712.48 --> 2716.48
it's yeah

2714.6 --> 2719.359
[Music]

2716.48 --> 2720.72
besides yeah dreaming on things like

2719.359 --> 2725.2799999999997
music and

2720.72 --> 2725.2799999999997
fantasy and but yeah that

2725.52 --> 2729.52
that usually the way that works is the

2727.92 --> 2730.88
reward comes the other way around it

2729.52 --> 2732.8
starts

2730.88 --> 2734.4
heavy and then it dries down and then it

2732.8 --> 2737.52
kind of goes into

2734.4 --> 2738.96
this interest when helping somebody it's

2737.52 --> 2741.28
the other way around it's like an

2738.96 --> 2744.319
investment and then

2741.28 --> 2746.5600000000004
it's like really rewarding and you i you

2744.319 --> 2749.839
can't i can't explain it because

2746.56 --> 2750.24
it's not so much physiological it's not

2749.839 --> 2753.04
so

2750.24 --> 2754.7999999999997
hormonal compared to other typical

2753.04 --> 2757.92
social interaction work

2754.8 --> 2760.2400000000002
sex and all that no it's

2757.92 --> 2762.079
it's really a spirit thing it's almost

2760.24 --> 2764.56
like you get

2762.079 --> 2765.92
like a scoop of energy on top of your

2764.56 --> 2769.2
spirit when it happens

2765.92 --> 2770.0
it's kind of mystical because when it

2769.2 --> 2772.24
happens

2770.0 --> 2773.119
i don't see it coming it's almost like i

2772.24 --> 2776.7999999999997
forgot

2773.119 --> 2779.599
how special that is

2776.8 --> 2779.599
when it happens

2780.56 --> 2784.4
and therefore i also very important this

2784.16 --> 2786.56
is

2784.4 --> 2788.319
this is a more complex mystery about

2786.56 --> 2790.56
that and even about logos

2788.319 --> 2793.04
you can't get addicted to it you can get

2790.56 --> 2794.16
addicted to the spirit energy reward of

2793.04 --> 2796.56
helping people

2794.16 --> 2797.52
but the problem is if you're addicted

2796.56 --> 2800.0
that means

2797.52 --> 2802.4
you're escaping you're escaping from

2800.0 --> 2806.0
something else and then

2802.4 --> 2809.52
you're basically trying to fill the gap

2806.0 --> 2812.72
with the spirit energy doesn't work

2809.52 --> 2812.72
because you're still escaping

2814.88 --> 2818.319
it has to be natural

2818.64 --> 2824.96
from a non-escapist vantage point

2823.2 --> 2828.16
if you're just helping out just to

2824.96 --> 2830.319
forget about something about yourself

2828.16 --> 2832.3999999999996
bypassing it overlooking it forgetting

2830.319 --> 2835.839
about it not fixing it

2832.4 --> 2839.76
then it doesn't have the same it doesn't

2835.839 --> 2843.04
actually have that

2839.76 --> 2845.5200000000004
electrical spark effect that's my

2843.04 --> 2846.4
experience so you can get addicted to

2845.52 --> 2848.4
helping

2846.4 --> 2850.4
then it doesn't work anymore you kind of

2848.4 --> 2853.76
mandate yourself and then you start

2850.4 --> 2856.7200000000003
it starts to turn to fear

2853.76 --> 2858.4
like you must do it then and you know it

2856.72 --> 2861.9199999999996
doesn't work anymore

2858.4 --> 2861.92
hmm people forget that

2863.04 --> 2869.92
you know who i'm talking about there's

2866.64 --> 2873.839
like the good willing ones a lot of them

2869.92 --> 2873.839
had risked this

2880.8 --> 2887.8390000000004
oh yeah i did think that absolutely i've

2883.68 --> 2887.839
been tested on it

2888.24 --> 2892.5589999999997
oh don't time him out i was gonna make

2890.4 --> 2897.2000000000003
him an example

2892.559 --> 2897.2000000000003
come on he has the con face

2897.92 --> 2903.28
this is worth addressing and it's

2899.68 --> 2905.1189999999997
actually sort of into the subject

2903.28 --> 2907.76
so yeah he's basically oh have you

2905.119 --> 2909.92
considered that you might be

2907.76 --> 2912.079
irrelevant that's just stupid to say but

2909.92 --> 2912.96
schizophrenic or delusions of grandeur

2912.079 --> 2915.8390000000004
oh yeah

2912.96 --> 2916.559
i've been tested on schizophrenia didn't

2915.839 --> 2920.0789999999997
have it

2916.559 --> 2922.88
just very minor traces

2920.079 --> 2924.559
and they can't really pinpoint it and

2922.88 --> 2926.1600000000003
i've kind of grown out of

2924.559 --> 2928.0
those original assessments so

2926.16 --> 2931.2799999999997
technically i don't think i have any

2928.0 --> 2934.4
of it anymore but my person

2931.28 --> 2938.0
my my personal character structure

2934.4 --> 2941.28
is extremely unusual

2938.0 --> 2943.119
out of it but i'm definitely not

2941.28 --> 2945.76
schizophrenic or anything like that

2943.119 --> 2945.76
anymore

2946.079 --> 2952.8
do i have a lot of uh extra perceptional

2949.52 --> 2954.8
experiences though but i yeah i can i'm

2952.8 --> 2955.8390000000004
extremely detailed descriptive and

2954.8 --> 2959.119
consistent

2955.839 --> 2963.92
i've explained to different people

2959.119 --> 2965.76
this has been checked different people

2963.92 --> 2967.04
different times i would basically come

2965.76 --> 2968.96
up to them and like help

2967.04 --> 2970.72
this is like in the early like five

2968.96 --> 2973.2
years ago when the dark world visions

2970.72 --> 2975.52
like really hit me out of nowhere

2973.2 --> 2977.4399999999996
from out of the amnesia and i've been

2975.52 --> 2981.2
telling all them this and that and that

2977.44 --> 2985.04
and then afterward it was it is

2981.2 --> 2987.9199999999996
exactly the same it is very persistent

2985.04 --> 2989.52
it's real it it's not necessarily

2987.92 --> 2990.8
something that has happened physically

2989.52 --> 2993.359
but it did happen

2990.8 --> 2995.119
effectively to me it has had the

2993.359 --> 2998.88
influence it has a

2995.119 --> 3001.839
thing and it is real

2998.88 --> 3004.319
it's real to me and that doesn't mean

3001.839 --> 3007.359
delusional it means it's real to me

3004.319 --> 3012.0
in a way that other people just can't

3007.359 --> 3014.0789999999997
really they're not involved

3012.0 --> 3017.04
and they know it you know there's such

3014.079 --> 3017.04
things intuitively

3017.28 --> 3021.119
it's my thing it's my personal thing

3020.16 --> 3023.7599999999998
that i went through

3021.119 --> 3026.7200000000003
my spiritual journey my experience that

3023.76 --> 3030.6400000000003
is incredible

3026.72 --> 3034.0
and yeah delusions of grandeur

3030.64 --> 3038.0789999999997
i've talked about it i've literally said

3034.0 --> 3040.8
yes i was absolutely that

3038.079 --> 3041.76
at a time because the energy was just so

3040.8 --> 3045.28
much

3041.76 --> 3046.079
that it made me delusional it's like i

3045.28 --> 3049.28
felt like

3046.079 --> 3051.3590000000004
i feel so incredible i must be a god

3049.28 --> 3052.4
that was almost the conclusion that came

3051.359 --> 3055.92
out of it

3052.4 --> 3058.4
it's like you you can't feel that good

3055.92 --> 3060.16
and see so much and so sharp and

3058.4 --> 3062.8
basically

3060.16 --> 3063.92
you can i couldn't imagine not being a

3062.8 --> 3066.319
god

3063.92 --> 3067.28
you know from all the rough descriptions

3066.319 --> 3069.2799999999997
and references

3067.28 --> 3070.48
that's what i kind of felt back then and

3069.28 --> 3074.1600000000003
it was to me like

3070.48 --> 3075.04
how am i going to share this with the

3074.16 --> 3078.5589999999997
world

3075.04 --> 3080.8
now of course 20 years later

3078.559 --> 3082.079
that feels really weird that i was in

3080.8 --> 3086.0
that position in my mind

3082.079 --> 3088.6400000000003
that that was real to me

3086.0 --> 3092.88
but i can't explain it because it's just

3088.64 --> 3092.8799999999997
it was overwhelmed by the sensations

3093.2 --> 3099.359
and one of the things is that with

3096.079 --> 3101.76
sensations my intellect does not stop

3099.359 --> 3103.2799999999997
like even in extremely painful

3101.76 --> 3106.48
experiences

3103.28 --> 3109.119
my mind doesn't stop like

3106.48 --> 3110.079
i can be emotionally completely burst

3109.119 --> 3113.28
and

3110.079 --> 3117.2000000000003
just mangled in massive grief

3113.28 --> 3120.079
to catatonic levels and i'll still

3117.2 --> 3120.64
have my mind working perfectly on top of

3120.079 --> 3123.04
that

3120.64 --> 3124.0789999999997
so i might be i've even described this

3123.04 --> 3127.2
earlier like i have this

3124.079 --> 3129.04
weird weird scenarios it's quite surreal

3127.2 --> 3130.24
thinking back about it where i would

3129.04 --> 3132.64
yeah literally

3130.24 --> 3133.359
be drooling on the floor because of just

3132.64 --> 3135.7599999999998
the pain

3133.359 --> 3137.2
and trauma that wasn't like

3135.76 --> 3141.119
post-traumatic stress

3137.2 --> 3144.96
syndrome attacks basically but as i was

3141.119 --> 3147.92
like that i would basically explain

3144.96 --> 3149.68
exactly what i was experiencing and how

3147.92 --> 3152.48
and how it worked i could do that

3149.68 --> 3154.96
while being like that while barely being

3152.48 --> 3157.119
able to move no but my mouth

3154.96 --> 3158.2400000000002
was able to move and my thoughts were

3157.119 --> 3161.44
perfect and i could just

3158.24 --> 3164.4799999999996
explain exactly what was happening

3161.44 --> 3169.04
and it was correct

3164.48 --> 3172.079
so yeah i've had some weird experiences

3169.04 --> 3173.119
but i know what it is so you can you can

3172.079 --> 3175.92
think

3173.119 --> 3176.88
you can think oh oh we we control him oh

3175.92 --> 3180.88
look at all these

3176.88 --> 3183.359
elements these elements that when people

3180.88 --> 3184.319
somebody else reveals that of those

3183.359 --> 3187.44
people

3184.319 --> 3190.96
that means you can embarrass them now

3187.44 --> 3193.76
that's socially normalized so oh

3190.96 --> 3194.4
somebody the vulnerability is exposed

3193.76 --> 3198.48
let's

3194.4 --> 3202.64
shame him for it right mr trolly troll

3198.48 --> 3205.599
right well i'm doing

3202.64 --> 3206.24
something that does not fall in line

3205.599 --> 3209.52
with

3206.24 --> 3213.5989999999997
that social normalized structure

3209.52 --> 3216.96
ever it's my personal attack

3213.599 --> 3220.559
on so social normalization

3216.96 --> 3223.44
of the the depraved society

3220.559 --> 3225.2000000000003
that getting more depressed society this

3223.44 --> 3228.2400000000002
is what i do i'm basically saying

3225.2 --> 3230.7999999999997
no all those things all those packing

3228.24 --> 3234.319
order behaviors all

3230.8 --> 3237.6800000000003
can all die

3234.319 --> 3241.44
fade away and get drug

3237.68 --> 3241.44
into hell where you belong

3244.079 --> 3248.88
right so yeah i'm just sharing it i'm

3247.04 --> 3251.359
just saying exactly what it is

3248.88 --> 3252.319
exactly how it works and i'm basically

3251.359 --> 3256.24
sharing it

3252.319 --> 3260.24
to share with you it's not a weakness

3256.24 --> 3262.5589999999997
i got a thing it's part of my character

3260.24 --> 3263.9199999999996
and most people are so afraid of it so

3262.559 --> 3266.079
ashamed they don't know what to do with

3263.92 --> 3269.119
it that they hide it their entire lives

3266.079 --> 3270.8
build a mask on top of it to hide that

3269.119 --> 3271.52
they have the weakness and that's what

3270.8 --> 3274.7200000000003
they are

3271.52 --> 3277.92
well i don't i show

3274.72 --> 3279.9199999999996
my weaknesses i'm not [ __ ] afraid

3277.92 --> 3282.559
come at me

3279.92 --> 3282.559
come at me

3283.04 --> 3286.96
come here think you think you can hurt

3286.16 --> 3290.16
me

3286.96 --> 3293.52
you think you can hurt me because i show

3290.16 --> 3296.8799999999997
my personal vulnerable sides

3293.52 --> 3301.599
that i got under control you think

3296.88 --> 3301.599
you think you can hurt me huh

3304.64 --> 3309.92
i don't think so most of your chat know

3318.839 --> 3321.839
better

3326.559 --> 3333.3590000000004
all right see see project see

3330.559 --> 3335.0400000000004
he's trying to yeah to control it but

3333.359 --> 3338.96
yeah i answered your question

3335.04 --> 3342.16
believe it or not i did

3338.96 --> 3344.2400000000002
see and that's why you sometimes when

3342.16 --> 3346.16
trolls try to get personal don't time

3344.24 --> 3347.1189999999997
them out you know it's only when they

3346.16 --> 3350.72
just get

3347.119 --> 3351.599
blatantly disgusting like perversed in a

3350.72 --> 3354.16
bad way

3351.599 --> 3355.04
then timing out yeah because you're you

3354.16 --> 3357.839
need to

3355.04 --> 3358.48
scrub it for the other viewers but if

3357.839 --> 3360.96
somebody

3358.48 --> 3361.599
tries like a really personal attack

3360.96 --> 3364.7200000000003
don't

3361.599 --> 3365.92
don't you dare time that out i'll just

3364.72 --> 3369.7599999999998
say it like that

3365.92 --> 3372.7200000000003
don't don't ever you don't like

3369.76 --> 3374.7990000000004
me being attacked because you've put me

3372.72 --> 3376.9599999999996
on a pedestal did you

3374.799 --> 3378.0
well that's your issue now you got a

3376.96 --> 3381.04
problem

3378.0 --> 3384.319
because i don't

3381.04 --> 3389.52
want you to get that

3384.319 --> 3392.88
out of my way i want that confrontation

3389.52 --> 3398.559
why do you think i show myself

3392.88 --> 3398.559
in as vulnerable and open as i am

3400.16 --> 3405.92
i'm not winding myself into a frenzy

3403.359 --> 3409.04
this is nothing like a frenzy getting

3405.92 --> 3409.04
sick don't overblow this

3415.599 --> 3418.96
embarrassment is the last unexplored

3417.44 --> 3421.119
emotion

3418.96 --> 3423.76
oh yeah embarrassment but embarrassment

3421.119 --> 3427.6800000000003
doesn't have to lead to shame

3423.76 --> 3427.6800000000003
you know that's what most people tend to

3430.839 --> 3433.839
overlook

3434.559 --> 3443.28
there's every aspect of natural

3439.119 --> 3447.52
social communication can be

3443.28 --> 3449.76
utilized effectively and constructively

3447.52 --> 3453.2
but it's very difficult it leaves takes

3449.76 --> 3453.2000000000003
a lifetime dedication

3453.839 --> 3459.2799999999997
facing against the world that will

3455.76 --> 3459.28
absolutely do the opposite

3459.68 --> 3466.799
but it is doable it all

3463.04 --> 3469.2799999999997
has a purpose a place that works and it

3466.799 --> 3471.04
might not completely work out with your

3469.28 --> 3473.2000000000003
mind structures

3471.04 --> 3475.2
but it's not about that it works it's

3473.2 --> 3477.9199999999996
social it's subconscious

3475.2 --> 3480.0789999999997
it's intuitive it is instinct it is

3477.92 --> 3482.88
bodily visceral

3480.079 --> 3483.3590000000004
and it it does not give a [ __ ] what you

3482.88 --> 3486.7200000000003
think

3483.359 --> 3489.839
it works the way it works and you got to

3486.72 --> 3489.839
deal with it

3490.799 --> 3495.28
yeah and that's indeed an extra message

3493.04 --> 3498.88
to sjws because they

3495.28 --> 3501.119
are trying to completely erase

3498.88 --> 3503.6800000000003
normal social behavior and trying to

3501.119 --> 3507.04
replace it with their ridiculous

3503.68 --> 3507.04
artificial construct

3508.48 --> 3517.839
yeah and i declare spiritual war on them

3512.64 --> 3517.839
just for that fact alone

3522.0 --> 3525.04
because i am

3525.2 --> 3529.2799999999997
a social conservative

3529.44 --> 3533.68
yeah and that's not a political

3531.68 --> 3537.52
designation it means

3533.68 --> 3540.799
i am for conserving natural

3537.52 --> 3544.079
effective and

3540.799 --> 3546.24
well just good social behavior

3544.079 --> 3548.1600000000003
while the entire world is working its

3546.24 --> 3550.8799999999997
best at derailing it

3548.16 --> 3552.64
i'm a social conservative that's

3550.88 --> 3556.079
socialist

3552.64 --> 3557.839
social oh

3556.079 --> 3559.92
you know what [ __ ] that maybe i'm

3557.839 --> 3563.839
socialist what does it even mean

3559.92 --> 3566.559
you know not a [ __ ] communist

3563.839 --> 3569.04
a marxist a socialist you know the

3566.559 --> 3571.119
earliest version

3569.04 --> 3572.079
before it all got grabble and all that

3571.119 --> 3576.0
in germany

3572.079 --> 3578.079
right well yeah maybe

3576.0 --> 3579.599
it wouldn't draw eugenics and all that

3578.079 --> 3581.2000000000003
[ __ ] in it but i'm pretty sure that is

3579.599 --> 3583.76
part of the graveling process that

3581.2 --> 3583.7599999999998
happened there

3584.0 --> 3588.16
anyway let's not drag all that into it

3586.16 --> 3592.0789999999997
no this is not really necessary

3588.16 --> 3594.799
i'm a social conservative and that is

3592.079 --> 3597.52
a personal thing and not a political

3594.799 --> 3597.52
designation

3598.839 --> 3603.839
of social conservationist

3608.079 --> 3615.2000000000003
right yeah you know that technically the

3612.079 --> 3617.6800000000003
word conservative is exactly the same

3615.2 --> 3619.9199999999996
it is that it's just that it's become

3617.68 --> 3621.44
the political

3619.92 --> 3623.28
it's like every time the word is brought

3621.44 --> 3624.799
up it has a political meaning that you

3623.28 --> 3627.119
can't really escape from

3624.799 --> 3628.72
but it technically means the same it's

3627.119 --> 3643.839
conserving it's to

3628.72 --> 3643.839
keep it together not let it erode

3655.2 --> 3660.5589999999997
all right orochimaru

3658.48 --> 3661.52
sound interesting you're correct it's

3660.559 --> 3664.559
the it's the

3661.52 --> 3664.559
reversed welders

3666.24 --> 3674.319
everything's turned around

3670.96 --> 3685.839
don't go cap tommy again agm come on

3674.319 --> 3685.839
stop it

3686.16 --> 3699.839
it happened by accident yeah sure it did

3690.96 --> 3699.839
that's all right

3710.839 --> 3713.839
okay

3714.96 --> 3720.4
oh god omar colored it yeah that

3717.68 --> 3724.24
specifically wasn't

3720.4 --> 3724.2400000000002
really talking about politics

3724.319 --> 3727.68
libertarian and like these things are

3726.559 --> 3730.0
all

3727.68 --> 3730.72
pretty artificial constructs that are

3730.0 --> 3735.119
meant to be

3730.72 --> 3738.839
part of a corporate technocracy

3735.119 --> 3741.92
you know because i think that we

3738.839 --> 3744.72
basically just live in a corporate

3741.92 --> 3747.599
technocracy worldwide

3744.72 --> 3750.5589999999997
multiple players and yeah these things

3747.599 --> 3754.319
are the guiding programs

3750.559 --> 3756.0
within that system because

3754.319 --> 3758.0
you can't really get away from the

3756.0 --> 3760.96
technocracy it's

3758.0 --> 3762.64
it's what you use on a daily basis you

3760.96 --> 3765.119
can't escape that

3762.64 --> 3766.48
unless you are going to be like an ultra

3765.119 --> 3770.319
classic conservative

3766.48 --> 3775.039
than amish basically and just abandon it

3770.319 --> 3775.0389999999998
yeah who's gonna do that so

3777.52 --> 3784.0
i've kind of yeah abandoned that idea of

3781.28 --> 3786.88
having a political designation tied in

3784.0 --> 3790.079
with my identity i'm conservative i'm

3786.88 --> 3793.76
a liberal i'm a libertarian

3790.079 --> 3795.6800000000003
you know that

3793.76 --> 3797.119
i've called myself a libertarian for a

3795.68 --> 3799.9199999999996
while but

3797.119 --> 3801.76
there's many issues with it i've even

3799.92 --> 3803.839
called myself a liberal while the issues

3801.76 --> 3806.48
are so blatantly obvious but it's also

3803.839 --> 3808.64
obvious that liberals now are just

3806.48 --> 3810.72
nothing like what liberals

3808.64 --> 3814.0789999999997
like the liberals at the top are just

3810.72 --> 3818.799
nothing like the liberals that

3814.079 --> 3818.799
are at the bottom nothing alike not even

3822.839 --> 3825.839
close

3827.28 --> 3830.96
that's good i'm glad you were able to

3829.839 --> 3839.839
squirt over that

3830.96 --> 3839.839
project retribution

3861.68 --> 3864.839
they will accumulate for themselves

3863.2 --> 3866.8799999999997
teachers to shoot their own passions

3864.839 --> 3869.2799999999997
yeah well that's kind of already

3866.88 --> 3869.28
happening

3878.16 --> 3881.68
i think that's what a lot of people here

3879.92 --> 3886.2400000000002
are doing in a way

3881.68 --> 3886.24
we seek out our own sources and then

3892.839 --> 3895.839
learn

3903.49 --> 3906.8199999999997
[Music]

3916.31 --> 3919.469
[Music]

3920.559 --> 3925.92
[ __ ] that's like an impossible to

3923.2 --> 3925.9199999999996
pronounce word

3931.2 --> 3937.839
is that a real thing or did you make

3932.96 --> 3937.839
that up

3949.61 --> 3952.809

3954.079 --> 3959.119
okay robin stanley i've never read it i

3957.039 --> 3961.76
think it was an option to read it but i

3959.119 --> 3961.76
went for the

3962.16 --> 3966.8799999999997
1984 and brave new world instead

3972.16 --> 3976.799
or wait in mice and men i also read that

3974.559 --> 3976.799
one

3976.839 --> 3979.839
right

4004.839 --> 4007.839
so

4012.079 --> 4021.28
paranoid antagonist what

4015.44 --> 4025.48
is that what you said that weird thing

4021.28 --> 4035.8390000000004
i'm gonna try again the perinoid

4025.48 --> 4035.839
dentaguinist is that what it is

4042.16 --> 4047.1189999999997
oh wait you were literally spelling

4045.039 --> 4049.2000000000003
paranoid antagonist in the worst

4047.119 --> 4051.44
possible way

4049.2 --> 4054.24
it was so bad spell that i actually

4051.44 --> 4057.28
thought it was an original word

4054.24 --> 4057.839
that's rare and it's rare that somebody

4057.28 --> 4061.599
puts

4057.839 --> 4063.2799999999997
a word out so damn bad

4061.599 --> 4065.52
that i would mistake it for something

4063.28 --> 4065.52
else

4065.68 --> 4068.64
oh dear god

4069.52 --> 4073.839
i didn't even recognize it that it was

4074.839 --> 4077.839
that

4091.95 --> 4095.8399999999997
[Music]

4098.12 --> 4102.01
[Music]

4109.52 --> 4119.839000000001
hmm storming over there is it

4112.88 --> 4119.839
rubbing hmm

4144.839 --> 4147.839
hmm

4159.12 --> 4161.839
ah

4196.719 --> 4203.84
yeah i'm getting really dreamy and

4198.239 --> 4203.839999999999
distracted here

4204.719 --> 4210.2390000000005
yeah i waste a lot of my time basically

4207.36 --> 4212.639999999999
thinking about the past and then

4210.239 --> 4213.5199999999995
changing one element about myself like

4212.64 --> 4216.88
what if

4213.52 --> 4220.2390000000005
i actually went with this and

4216.88 --> 4221.679
kept to it and or if i didn't had this

4220.239 --> 4224.718999999999
much of a burden

4221.679 --> 4225.76
from this situation but it's a complete

4224.719 --> 4228.719
waste of time

4225.76 --> 4230.0
to dream about that but it's just like

4228.719 --> 4232.64
so many times i'm just

4230.0 --> 4234.8
wondering like could i've done better

4232.64 --> 4236.8
could i

4234.8 --> 4239.1990000000005
what was really the cornerstone that

4236.8 --> 4239.1990000000005
kind of

4239.44 --> 4246.639999999999
caused this before

4242.88 --> 4249.28
now because i could have been much

4246.64 --> 4251.360000000001
better and not be all complaining about

4249.28 --> 4253.84
society

4251.36 --> 4255.759999999999
if i'd had more personal grip on the

4253.84 --> 4257.92
situation in many ways

4255.76 --> 4258.88
then i could have maneuvered my way

4257.92 --> 4262.719
through

4258.88 --> 4262.719
without corrupting i think even

4266.56 --> 4270.8
but yeah i use it as you know i've used

4268.48 --> 4272.5599999999995
it as an excuse to

4270.8 --> 4274.159000000001
to basically say afterwards like yeah

4272.56 --> 4276.080000000001
that's why i didn't do it because

4274.159 --> 4277.44
this and this would have happened and

4276.08 --> 4281.199
now i realize

4277.44 --> 4283.36
longer time goes like [ __ ]

4281.199 --> 4285.678999999999
that's just a [ __ ] excuse from to

4283.36 --> 4289.199
cover my own shame about it

4285.679 --> 4291.1990000000005
it's probably wrong but yeah

4289.199 --> 4292.4
what were the conditions that made me do

4291.199 --> 4295.839999999999
it the way i did it

4292.4 --> 4298.5599999999995
back then how could have then that been

4295.84 --> 4301.84
somehow averted

4298.56 --> 4301.84
you know

4304.4 --> 4309.199
it's it's a complete it's folly to spend

4307.04 --> 4310.4
your energy on that but i still do it a

4309.199 --> 4314.639999999999
lot of the time

4310.4 --> 4318.879999999999
because i have a lot of regrets

4314.64 --> 4321.84
you know a lot

4318.88 --> 4321.84
not letting it

4322.56 --> 4326.0
i'm trying to not let it weigh me down

4324.8 --> 4329.84
but

4326.0 --> 4329.84
it's there

4340.239 --> 4346.239
i'm still talking about books i'm not of

4343.76 --> 4346.2390000000005
the books

4346.32 --> 4350.0
i know robin stanley i know

4352.239 --> 4357.919999999999
maybe yeah with saying that

4355.6 --> 4359.04
and what i just said maybe it explains a

4357.92 --> 4360.719
lot more about

4359.04 --> 4362.56
things that i've shared with you in

4360.719 --> 4365.28
person about

4362.56 --> 4368.080000000001
what my state state of being is

4365.28 --> 4370.48
sometimes like

4368.08 --> 4385.84
i think it does come from just a giant

4370.48 --> 4385.839999999999
pile of very deep regrets

4396.84 --> 4399.84
okay

4409.28 --> 4413.84
vitamin k in cucumbers yeah

4423.36 --> 4426.48
what guns have nephron really they don't

4425.6 --> 4430.8
allow you

4426.48 --> 4430.799999999999
on hangout damn

4436.08 --> 4440.239
so they're afraid you're gonna like

4437.6 --> 4455.84
spill secrets or something

4440.239 --> 4455.839999999999
by accident like that hmm

4488.96 --> 4493.12
it's fresh in here fresh air in here and

4491.679 --> 4497.84
then

4493.12 --> 4497.84
it's warm

4508.84 --> 4511.84
hmm

4527.04 --> 4532.4
right yeah gideon's sick yeah if you're

4529.36 --> 4539.839999999999
gonna use vitamin d3 and all that

4532.4 --> 4539.839999999999
then vitamin k is also kind of important

4564.84 --> 4567.84
hmm

4574.48 --> 4577.57
[Music]

4578.32 --> 4586.32
see yeah yeah 50 more minutes or so

4582.48 --> 4586.32
i don't really know what's next

4587.36 --> 4590.719
you imagine my hangouts is very

4589.52 --> 4594.96
therapeutic for me

4590.719 --> 4598.2390000000005
well i'm almost literally just

4594.96 --> 4600.88
doing shared open cell therapy

4598.239 --> 4603.5199999999995
being the therapist and the the one

4600.88 --> 4605.679
getting the treatment

4603.52 --> 4608.64
as a presentation to you guys part of

4605.679 --> 4612.96
what i do

4608.64 --> 4614.320000000001
so yeah it is therapeutic for me it's

4612.96 --> 4617.92
also

4614.32 --> 4621.12
it forces me in a very

4617.92 --> 4622.56
public way i guess forces me to keep

4621.12 --> 4624.8
improving so i don't

4622.56 --> 4626.159000000001
let it slip close and fall asleep and

4624.8 --> 4629.04
just forget about

4626.159 --> 4631.199
everything so it's like such a

4629.04 --> 4634.719
confrontation

4631.199 --> 4637.12
it demands that i improve

4634.719 --> 4640.0
because if i want it will be visible and

4637.12 --> 4642.5599999999995
there's no returning from that

4640.0 --> 4645.92
so it's almost like i'm publicly

4642.56 --> 4651.84
blackmailing myself to improve

4645.92 --> 4651.84
so that odd when you think about it

4661.36 --> 4664.4
that's not really blackmail if it's

4662.88 --> 4679.84
public but

4664.4 --> 4679.839999999999
i think you guys got the idea

4688.48 --> 4707.839999999999
what does vitamin k do uh

4692.48 --> 4707.839999999999
god i'll just look it up

4713.76 --> 4718.159000000001
okay let's get a reliable source and not

4716.239 --> 4721.5199999999995
some shitty google result

4718.159 --> 4724.48
i think google is the worst

4721.52 --> 4727.52
only have shed sites they recommend it's

4724.48 --> 4727.5199999999995
so disgusting

4732.84 --> 4735.84
uh

4745.36 --> 4749.839999999999
hmm come on

4754.0 --> 4763.84
oh well that doesn't help either thanks

4768.64 --> 4775.4400000000005
anyway it from what i remember it works

4771.679 --> 4775.4400000000005
in conjunction with vitamin d

4775.679 --> 4782.4800000000005
like it significantly amplifies

4780.4 --> 4784.4
the i don't know absorbability or

4782.48 --> 4786.959999999999
effectiveness of vitamin d that's

4784.4 --> 4786.96
most of it

4788.239 --> 4792.239
that's what i remember of it now it

4790.159 --> 4794.48
might have look every vitamin has

4792.239 --> 4795.919999999999
all these different little details that

4794.48 --> 4799.199
it does and you know i

4795.92 --> 4805.84
don't i'm not a nutritionist i i haven't

4799.199 --> 4805.839999999999
studied that and learned it by heart

4808.96 --> 4813.76
anyone seen the comet it's not epic it's

4811.52 --> 4815.280000000001
just a light in the sky and yes i have

4813.76 --> 4819.04
seen it

4815.28 --> 4820.0
three days ago it was too cloudy

4819.04 --> 4822.88
yesterday

4820.0 --> 4822.88
yesterday night but

4824.0 --> 4828.08
did see some other weird things though

4830.08 --> 4834.8
might have seen a ufo but it seemed more

4832.719 --> 4838.96
like a plane but

4834.8 --> 4841.12
it its light was unusually bright and it

4838.96 --> 4844.0
wasn't flickering and it just almost

4841.12 --> 4845.04
seemed like a very steadily drifting

4844.0 --> 4848.56
light

4845.04 --> 4850.56
it didn't really slow down

4848.56 --> 4851.92
giving the suggestion that it might have

4850.56 --> 4855.120000000001
been purely optical

4851.92 --> 4858.159
which i think most ufos are pure optics

4855.12 --> 4859.92
holographic effects

4858.159 --> 4861.839999999999
it just didn't seem like a plane that

4859.92 --> 4864.0
was going slowly and slower into the

4861.84 --> 4867.28
distance to the horizon

4864.0 --> 4868.4
it was weird i i never really identified

4867.28 --> 4870.48
what it was

4868.4 --> 4871.759999999999
so i saw that little stupid little

4870.48 --> 4877.759999999999
thingies

4871.76 --> 4877.76
and uh yeah but the comet i have seen it

4880.8 --> 4889.84
it's just another light

4900.08 --> 4904.08
yeah thanks again appreciate it

4904.239 --> 4917.839999999999
fireball jesus

4928.84 --> 4934.2390000000005
hmm all right okay well guns would never

4931.6 --> 4936.2390000000005
look if if you were really that deep

4934.239 --> 4938.5599999999995
into the

4936.239 --> 4940.159
into the structural hierarchy you could

4938.56 --> 4944.400000000001
call it

4940.159 --> 4946.96
and all that in military access

4944.4 --> 4949.199
i'm wondering like what is your personal

4946.96 --> 4953.28
opinion about the

4949.199 --> 4956.48
flat earth models mostly the disc model

4953.28 --> 4960.159
and what that is how it was

4956.48 --> 4964.159
put out and everybody yeah launching

4960.159 --> 4966.96
to reify that specific model

4964.159 --> 4969.04
and trying to bypass the shortcomings

4966.96 --> 4971.36
what do you think about that

4969.04 --> 4972.159
like have you did you even come to any

4971.36 --> 4975.92
kind of

4972.159 --> 4978.4
earth orientation conclusion

4975.92 --> 4980.88
before you bumped into flat earth on the

4978.4 --> 4980.879999999999
internet

4985.36 --> 4990.719
all right so just plan a stationary

4986.96 --> 4992.4800000000005
that's it that's the only elements

4990.719 --> 4993.92
or did you have a wider interest into

4992.48 --> 4996.08
the uh you know

4993.92 --> 4997.28
equatorial orientation or anything like

4996.08 --> 4999.679
that

4997.28 --> 5001.36
you know if fighter pilot is like in the

4999.679 --> 5003.36
best position

5001.36 --> 5004.4
to even test such things because they

5003.36 --> 5006.88
can go so

5004.4 --> 5006.879999999999
fast

5007.76 --> 5012.320000000001
that yeah you know

5012.639 --> 5019.36
what is it i think you could move

5017.52 --> 5021.040000000001
over the equator line however it's

5019.36 --> 5024.159
orientating

5021.04 --> 5026.08
in a couple of hours in like in a

5024.159 --> 5026.799999999999
fighter jet at full speed i don't know

5026.08 --> 5031.04
if it would

5026.8 --> 5031.04
have enough fuel to get that far though

5040.84 --> 5043.84
but

5044.32 --> 5046.639
hmm

5051.28 --> 5060.0
what ma walter bislin's model

5057.04 --> 5060.0
what what does that mean

5060.639 --> 5073.68
what is water beast in the mall

5070.55 --> 5073.68
[Music]

5077.84 --> 5081.1990000000005
all right okay yeah it's a reification

5080.56 --> 5084.639
model

5081.199 --> 5087.199
that one

5084.639 --> 5088.8
with the literal heavenly body

5087.199 --> 5093.12
presumptions and

5088.8 --> 5093.12
a dome hasn't been confirmed

5093.36 --> 5100.239
right right yeah clear hey look you can

5097.28 --> 5103.44
double down all you like on that

5100.239 --> 5103.44
no matter what he says

5105.84 --> 5113.28
it is legit yeah i don't know why you

5108.4 --> 5114.638999999999
said that

5113.28 --> 5116.4
because there's a lot of things that

5114.639 --> 5127.84
just don't work out with it like

5116.4 --> 5127.839999999999
really don't work out

5128.48 --> 5132.879999999999
like i'm pretty sure there's just more

5130.96 --> 5135.92
room at the north

5132.88 --> 5137.12
it's not this it's not this and i'm

5135.92 --> 5141.04
pretty sure there's not

5137.12 --> 5143.199
as much room at the south

5141.04 --> 5145.44
it's not that stretched up it's lit like

5143.199 --> 5149.44
even the segments just look at it

5145.44 --> 5149.44
they're all stretched up

5151.199 --> 5154.719
i don't believe that's literal that's

5153.44 --> 5157.678999999999
not the way it is

5154.719 --> 5157.679
in literalness

5163.92 --> 5169.84
let's just look how australia is just

5169.92 --> 5177.1990000000005
it's stretched guess what it's not

5173.92 --> 5178.88
australia is not stretched and south

5177.199 --> 5182.159
america is not

5178.88 --> 5187.28
compacted like that either it's not

5182.159 --> 5191.599999999999
so it's wrong it's a projection

5187.28 --> 5193.12
that is not physically literal that's it

5191.6 --> 5195.52
doesn't really matter because this is

5193.12 --> 5196.0
kind of another utilization in order to

5195.52 --> 5198.719
get the

5196.0 --> 5201.199
celestial system going right that's kind

5198.719 --> 5204.639
of what it is

5201.199 --> 5206.5599999999995
it's a model for the celestial bodies

5204.639 --> 5208.2390000000005
in a way with the presuppositional

5206.56 --> 5210.2390000000005
foundation that they are still physical

5208.239 --> 5211.919999999999
objects in literal locations at the

5210.239 --> 5213.28
presumed distances and all that and how

5211.92 --> 5216.32
will the light work out

5213.28 --> 5219.92
it's very fascinating it's not

5216.32 --> 5223.199
a literal 3d physical model of earth

5219.92 --> 5226.719
it's not that's bottom line

5223.199 --> 5239.839999999999
you can't you can't dispel that

5226.719 --> 5239.84
it's not literal

5245.84 --> 5249.360000000001
glow model no i'm not gonna make a globe

5248.08 --> 5253.84
model i'm not gonna

5249.36 --> 5253.839999999999
do their work for them

5256.639 --> 5264.159000000001
and there's already a map that has

5261.04 --> 5266.56
that that has a that where they

5264.159 --> 5269.839999999999
rearrange the land masses

5266.56 --> 5272.8
to be more as is guess what it's a

5269.84 --> 5272.8
rectangular mac

5273.36 --> 5277.28
i'll just show it i've shown it many

5278.84 --> 5281.84
times

5283.92 --> 5286.4
where is it

5289.199 --> 5295.839999999999
all right

5298.639 --> 5311.36
this one

5308.159 --> 5312.5599999999995
i'm not stating that this is an exactly

5311.36 --> 5316.799999999999
to scale

5312.56 --> 5323.84
situation although it probably is more

5316.8 --> 5323.84
than most

5334.84 --> 5337.84
so

5349.28 --> 5354.48
south and 1200 miles south of the fake

5352.159 --> 5354.48
pole

5362.84 --> 5365.84
huh

5367.199 --> 5372.799999999999
ah right it's like

5374.56 --> 5379.04
you mean neuschwaberland like that's

5377.6 --> 5381.84
supposed to be

5379.04 --> 5385.04
basically another continuation of the

5381.84 --> 5393.84
continent almost right

5385.04 --> 5393.84
like it continues on i don't know man

5401.44 --> 5406.08
but i have heard of the concept that

5403.28 --> 5409.36
there is

5406.08 --> 5412.4
secret continent somewhere

5409.36 --> 5412.4
and suavelan

5413.52 --> 5416.320000000001
oh what

5416.96 --> 5425.6
is switzerland

5420.8 --> 5430.159000000001
okay okay whatever landmass

5425.6 --> 5448.96
floating in space right anyway uh

5430.159 --> 5452.799999999999
let's get me back into the picture ready

5448.96 --> 5456.88
yeah cleary why are you asking me

5452.8 --> 5458.2390000000005
it's a highly basic rhetorical question

5456.88 --> 5460.32
come on

5458.239 --> 5463.839999999999
nobody use it because it's impractical

5460.32 --> 5463.84
to use and it doesn't work

5466.4 --> 5469.599999999999
maps are most practical when they're

5468.88 --> 5477.84
flat

5469.6 --> 5477.84
that's a fact

5487.76 --> 5491.52
anyway guys i'm gonna round out the show

5489.52 --> 5494.8
because i'm

5491.52 --> 5497.6
kind of running out of energy that was a

5494.8 --> 5497.6
good show i think

5498.08 --> 5502.239
well not as great as yesterday probably

5500.08 --> 5505.04

5502.239 --> 5505.919999999999

5505.04 --> 5509.199
