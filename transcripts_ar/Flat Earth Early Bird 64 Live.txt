3.259 --> 11.219
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

7.02 --> 16.56
early-bird number 64 I'm your host

11.219 --> 22.85
Arwen and today is a dreary day yeah but

16.56 --> 30.269
everything else seems to be fine

22.85 --> 34.05
so finally people are leaking in Steve

30.269 --> 39.92
Daniel field and there's ace globe tart

34.05 --> 39.919999999999995
pretender clown yeah

41.649 --> 48.76
I was watching a video right before this

45.82 --> 50.92
starting pretty much an hour ago some

48.76 --> 55.75
channel that I hadn't really noticed

50.92 --> 59.86
before age of disclosure on the other

55.75 --> 65.619
hand this channel might be around for a

59.86 --> 67.32
while let me check it anyway yeah what

65.619 --> 73.41
was so amazing about it

67.32 --> 76.17899999999999
since 2015 okay hmm interesting

73.41 --> 79.509
seems roughly around the time that Flat

76.179 --> 84.759
Earth came to the scene hmm

79.509 --> 87.07
anyway yeah I got it was a basic

84.759 --> 88.69
suggestion from YouTube itself when I

87.07 --> 93.1
was watching some video I don't even

88.69 --> 94.539
remember what and yeah I saw that and I

93.1 --> 98.11
thought you know what I'll take a look

94.539 --> 102.97
and it is amazing stuff it is kind of

98.11 --> 106.17
unlevel with martin Lydia's work except

102.97 --> 109.33
yeah he doesn't or whoever this of

106.17 --> 112.3
whoever this channel is he's not talking

109.33 --> 114.459
over it so it's just text and sound

112.3 --> 118.179
effects that personally I find extremely

114.459 --> 124.0
annoying accompt it about it and kind of

118.179 --> 128.00900000000001
a monotone singing all the time and yeah

124.0 --> 131.05
it could be worse but it's not really

128.009 --> 134.2
could do better in my opinion anyway the

131.05 --> 138.83
actual content and the theory the

134.2 --> 141.67999999999998
theories that this guy whoever it is

138.83 --> 144.95000000000002
is explaining throughout this video I've

141.68 --> 149.48000000000002
only watched 33 minutes now of a hundred

144.95 --> 152.2
and twenty three they're really really

149.48 --> 158.14
detailed and was quite astounded and

152.2 --> 163.25
yeah it he seems to grasped things from

158.14 --> 165.79999999999998
everywhere to form a pretty consistent

163.25 --> 169.67
picture of what was going on and yeah

165.8 --> 172.61
that includes Tarte area mostly and the

169.67 --> 178.64
mud flood and how it came to be fancy

172.61 --> 181.49
and it's only the first half-hour it is

178.64 --> 183.89
really fascinating and also talks about

181.49 --> 187.91
pyramids being energy generators and

183.89 --> 191.54
indeed the water covering it up this

187.91 --> 195.57999999999998
function yet stops the the functioning

191.54 --> 200.89999999999998
of it and this fits exactly in my

195.58 --> 205.73000000000002
Atlantean explanation how that happened

200.9 --> 207.89000000000001
way back then but apparently this guy is

205.73 --> 210.56
basically suggesting that all this

207.89 --> 213.29
technology of the ancients including and

210.56 --> 219.08
the trattoria and everything that it was

213.29 --> 222.88
all reused everything even in recent

219.08 --> 222.88000000000002
history so

223.17 --> 230.17
it is quite fascinating and basically

226.99 --> 231.13
pictures a world that was absolutely

230.17 --> 233.89
amazing

231.13 --> 236.41
just two hundred years ago and how it

233.89 --> 239.01999999999998
ended through what he calls the

236.41 --> 245.55
parasites the cult of the snake the

239.02 --> 248.65
opposers and he suggests that it was

245.55 --> 253.0
mythologized what really happened placed

248.65 --> 256.08
in the past again fascinating that Atari

253.0 --> 260.109
was basically overrun by barbarians that

256.08 --> 264.43
just destroyed almost everything a lot

260.109 --> 269.59
and yeah destroyed the the cohesion of

264.43 --> 273.52
the Empire and Wow it gave me a lot to

269.59 --> 276.21
think about and I will continue watching

273.52 --> 276.21
that video

289.63 --> 298.48
so yeah I was kind of hoping yet to see

294.4 --> 303.46
come since today hmm would be the fourth

298.48 --> 307.12
try no my Mike's not gonna get up it

303.46 --> 311.77
can't you know I could put it maximum

307.12 --> 316.24
volume and you just hear very loud

311.77 --> 318.88
mostly and me a little louder so no but

316.24 --> 321.64
yeah I am gonna fix it I'm gonna get on

318.88 --> 324.13
the audio banana thing it's gonna cost

321.64 --> 328.59
some money and at the end of this month

324.13 --> 331.33
I will be able to make those investments

328.59 --> 334.59999999999997
among some other things as well

331.33 --> 336.96999999999997
and yeah I will get on it as soon as

334.6 --> 341.29
possible and now that I'm well currently

336.97 --> 341.92
being sponsored that's gonna hurry up a

341.29 --> 345.70000000000005
lot

341.92 --> 347.83000000000004
instead of being smeared out over half a

345.7 --> 352.42
year or whatever yeah I can fix it

347.83 --> 355.8
because of your help so yeah I went to

352.42 --> 355.8
bed really early yesterday

356.069 --> 362.339
something to do with a certain bottle of

358.409 --> 365.069
wine and I had with my spaghetti a lot

362.339 --> 367.289
of fun with that but yeah I did go to

365.069 --> 371.909
bed like it one o'clock or something

367.289 --> 377.699
that you for me is quite early and watch

371.909 --> 383.129
some of the iron media fun ass it's a

377.699 --> 387.059
little bit embarrassed when yeah when

383.129 --> 388.8
they started to address me about my

387.059 --> 390.77900000000005
complaints of not getting paid and

388.8 --> 395.069
that's just thousand subscribers really

390.779 --> 397.469
means nothing and and yeah yeah I know I

395.069 --> 403.379
know I was just pissed off in the moment

397.469 --> 407.099
mostly and it's just this whole thing

403.379 --> 410.37
about YouTube acting out so weird

407.099 --> 412.589
although yeah this morning my

410.37 --> 418.52
subscribers suddenly seemed to have been

412.589 --> 426.33
ups to 983 even though it was stuck at

418.52 --> 428.729
932 last night so I guess I might have

426.33 --> 432.50899999999996
ran T to thank for that who apparently

428.729 --> 436.519
on journalism advertised for me there so

432.509 --> 436.519
yeah thank you everyone for subscribing

436.999 --> 445.49
yeah if this is gonna stay then yeah I

441.3 --> 445.49
might actually make it can't believe it

447.219 --> 453.11
maybe some people in YouTube just felt

451.009 --> 455.509
like they needed to screw around with me

453.11 --> 458.27000000000004
before I got there it's really kind of

455.509 --> 460.759
funny because yeah I'm the Alex Jones

458.27 --> 464.179
Show yesterday which by the way is

460.759 --> 467.719
getting quite interesting in this last

464.179 --> 469.80899999999997
week also including because of our own

467.719 --> 474.02
Benjamin that has become part of them

469.809 --> 481.069
who we has made a very very special Flat

474.02 --> 484.219
Earth video that was reposted Karen be

481.069 --> 486.97900000000004
very very fascinating very interesting

484.219 --> 489.889
to see that and yeah he seems to be now

486.979 --> 493.039
somebody who gets in on the show even

489.889 --> 495.169
with others talking about mostly liberal

493.039 --> 499.519
stuff and the New World Order in the

495.169 --> 502.039
deep state from but yeah this guy on his

499.519 --> 504.499
own time also talks about flatter than

502.039 --> 508.87899999999996
the mostly the lack of proof of the

504.499 --> 511.129
ballers and how crazy they get and he

508.879 --> 513.62
does it from a perspective where he is

511.129 --> 517.039
very frustrated because he wants the

513.62 --> 520.37
ball to be real but yeah the ballers are

517.039 --> 523.25
not handing him the proof that he knows

520.37 --> 528.79
he needs it's fascinating it's very

523.25 --> 533.149
interesting video so do watch that and

528.79 --> 538.399
yeah again on Infowars they talked about

533.149 --> 540.69
YouTube and about some thing a certain

538.399 --> 544.949
secret

540.69 --> 550.23
or some kind of plan that was funded to

544.949 --> 555.4399999999999
create a group of moderators in YouTube

550.23 --> 558.269
and a moderating system very benign very

555.44 --> 564.3290000000001
dark kind of system very corruption

558.269 --> 566.569
based - yeah to make everybody moderate

564.329 --> 573.9899999999999
themselves directed compartmentalized

566.569 --> 576.329
from this group of people so very creepy

573.99 --> 579.3
and I think that yes since these people

576.329 --> 582.3599999999999
are the marks they are Marxist they're

579.3 --> 584.939
picked to be exactly that yeah maybe

582.36 --> 587.67
they just don't like me because I talked

584.939 --> 590.399
about Alec Jones and I I say yeah I'm a

587.67 --> 592.529
liberal but from the 90s and I think

590.399 --> 595.5
that this new liberal Marxism is total

592.529 --> 599.699
[ __ ] and I say exactly why and I'm

595.5 --> 602.79
disappointed in the general liberal

599.699 --> 606.209
community for allowing themselves to

602.79 --> 607.86
become part of this insanity so maybe

606.209 --> 609.9899999999999
that's why they're screwing with me

607.86 --> 612.649
I don't know it's a bit far-fetched

609.99 --> 612.649
maybe

615.71 --> 620.7
anyway yeah lots of things are going on

618.3 --> 624.4699999999999
in the world right now lots lots lots of

620.7 --> 629.33
things have you heard about this crazy

624.47 --> 633.3000000000001
locust in Mecca man

629.33 --> 638.48
well yeah it's kind of ironic of course

633.3 --> 642.26
from certain perspectives but it's just

638.48 --> 642.26
looked really heavy

642.43 --> 646.64
I'm just swarming around there I wonder

645.05 --> 649.0699999999999
what they're even doing there is there

646.64 --> 652.37
something to eat there or are they

649.07 --> 658.0100000000001
coming towards some kind of energy are

652.37 --> 661.85
they being called by some energy that is

658.01 --> 663.5889999999999
their house how should we interpret that

661.85 --> 666.9200000000001
you know you can interpret it biblically

663.589 --> 671.589
and just see it as an omen or a sign of

666.92 --> 675.38
God or whatever or you could say okay

671.589 --> 679.7
insects warm insects are very much

675.38 --> 681.92
involved in electromagnetism they guide

679.7 --> 684.98
themselves through the electromagnetic

681.92 --> 686.99
fields of the earth and there's a lot

684.98 --> 688.6700000000001
more that we don't really know about but

686.99 --> 692.24
yeah that can definitely have suspicions

688.67 --> 693.65
about so yeah beside the biblical

692.24 --> 698.029
interpretations you can just see like

693.65 --> 700.1899999999999
okay there's something unusually unusual

698.029 --> 702.5889999999999
happening for example in the magnetic

700.19 --> 704.6600000000001
field that is causing these creatures to

702.589 --> 709.21
be called to this location even though

704.66 --> 709.2099999999999
there's no real fields to eat

710.05 --> 715.149
it's another way of thinking about it

711.67 --> 718.0889999999999
and yeah I have heard seen articles even

715.149 --> 720.399
and yeah it's always like how do you

718.089 --> 723.5200000000001
interpret this crap because it's usually

720.399 --> 727.899
from typical media sources suggesting

723.52 --> 731.279
the globe and all that but is there a

727.899 --> 733.99
pole shift they seem to have

731.279 --> 736.36
statistically measured that there is a

733.99 --> 744.149
pole the North Pole seems to be shifting

736.36 --> 749.41
from from Canada more towards Russia so

744.149 --> 752.74
okay well maybe if there is a more

749.41 --> 755.17
abrupt shift that that could cause this

752.74 --> 759.42
kind of magnetic anomalies to which

755.17 --> 759.42
swarms react

762.65 --> 767.06
anyway I'm gonna get me some tea

823.34 --> 828.5790000000001
right AJ

826.24 --> 831.4590000000001
yeah I would appreciate if some people

828.579 --> 843.309
came on at some point would be nice in

831.459 --> 847.5999999999999
doing a couple of solos but look 60 more

843.309 --> 851.05
to go so wonder if it's gonna be switch

847.6 --> 854.379
back to 9:15 again this night or

851.05 --> 858.809
something or maybe not maybe the

854.379 --> 858.809
nonsense has stopped finally who knows

875.2 --> 881.51
anyway yeah I am open for guests I've

877.76 --> 886.15
put the link out chat I mean in the

881.51 --> 886.15
master be chat and really brew a chat so

888.4 --> 895.13
and I gave it to come since I don't know

890.84 --> 897.73
this guy up here this time or it's just

895.13 --> 897.73
not meant to be

900.97 --> 908.339
great

903.07 --> 908.339
oh all the mental hospitals

912.16 --> 916.2199999999999
you know

914.03 --> 918.92
but that really necessary

916.22 --> 923.5
you know that mental hospitals the real

918.92 --> 923.5
functions they have is to protect

924.56 --> 932.5089999999999
yourself mostly and others from danger

928.879 --> 936.529
if you have that impulse if you're just

932.509 --> 939.589
crazy now no matter really how as long

936.529 --> 943.129
as there's no aggression or kind of

939.589 --> 944.36
suicidal tendencies yet usually you

943.129 --> 947.389
don't end up in a mental hospital

944.36 --> 950.42
although there are like places here even

947.389 --> 952.279
in the Netherlands where you can

950.42 --> 954.259
basically go when you have a breakdown

952.279 --> 957.8
and nobody else did to help you with

954.259 --> 960.759
that but yeah that's completely

957.8 --> 960.7589999999999
voluntary based

962.32 --> 968.98
never been there by the way I did get

966.07 --> 971.13
some psychology or as an alternative

968.98 --> 974.38
psychologist interesting stuff was that

971.13 --> 976.779
was enter Pacifica again my parents were

974.38 --> 979.389
always busy with that when I was a

976.779 --> 981.819
little kid because I was odd and not

979.389 --> 984.79
very good at communicating a lot of

981.819 --> 990.7299999999999
trouble socializing and they did study

984.79 --> 993.25
me but yeah at my breakdowns they don't

990.73 --> 996.94
last very long they don't cause damage

993.25 --> 999.87
thank God and except for maybe some

996.94 --> 999.87
noise here and there

1003.89 --> 1008.899
I don't know I I do know other people

1006.829 --> 1014.56
that have had really rough times that

1008.899 --> 1014.56
had actually done that

1017.67 --> 1024.87
it's a weird

1020.73 --> 1027.69
that works and to be fair like in my in

1024.87 --> 1030.6499999999999
the times when I felt the worst I did

1027.69 --> 1033.0
actually consider it just because I just

1030.65 --> 1036.0600000000002
needed a break from the pressure

1033.0 --> 1039.06
basically what I never did that I just

1036.06 --> 1043.9199999999998
sat through it and try to fix it as I go

1039.06 --> 1046.44
as I went try to basically reroute all

1043.92 --> 1048.3600000000001
the frustration energy into constructive

1046.44 --> 1050.79
energy transforming it it's very

1048.36 --> 1054.8999999999999
difficult but yeah I've trained that a

1050.79 --> 1057.3899999999999
lot over my life so it did kind of work

1054.9 --> 1060.8600000000001
out but unfortunately I didn't really

1057.39 --> 1060.8600000000001
have the wisdom yet

1064.27 --> 1069.48
to construct something with that time

1069.91 --> 1077.1200000000001
that has a more durable long-term

1074.02 --> 1078.86
results except for my own personal

1077.12 --> 1081.1899999999998
development that's always been going

1078.86 --> 1081.1899999999998
steady

1086.73 --> 1096.47
I've reroute your brain right it's

1089.73 --> 1102.45
mostly emotions emotions are dangerous

1096.47 --> 1107.13
especially if they they've fire up but

1102.45 --> 1109.32
they also bring a lot of energy so yeah

1107.13 --> 1113.25
if you have emotions and you don't learn

1109.32 --> 1116.22
to manage them then yeah you're gonna

1113.25 --> 1119.79
screw yourself with them everybody does

1116.22 --> 1121.89
at some point in their life and some

1119.79 --> 1124.31
people just completely suppress it and

1121.89 --> 1127.95
then you have another type of damage and

1124.31 --> 1131.81
disconnect the only real way to deal

1127.95 --> 1135.69
with it is to make mistakes with them

1131.81 --> 1138.57
learn of it and learn discipline so you

1135.69 --> 1141.5700000000002
can just apply your emotions in

1138.57 --> 1143.96
constructive ways or let it out in the

1141.57 --> 1148.35
right moment that will be accepted

1143.96 --> 1150.93
that's the way to deal with it and it's

1148.35 --> 1153.78
a critical part of adulthood really

1150.93 --> 1157.89
although the bar seems to have been kind

1153.78 --> 1161.25
of lowered in this remarkably in the

1157.89 --> 1163.7700000000002
last 20 years because society this is no

1161.25 --> 1166.83
longer the norm it is not seen as the

1163.77 --> 1171.97
norm it is admired but so many people

1166.83 --> 1175.509
don't really do this or barely that yeah

1171.97 --> 1179.7
in the 90s I thought everyone would be

1175.509 --> 1179.7
like that everyone would be really

1180.33 --> 1185.59
stable

1181.75 --> 1188.019
well it's 30 years later now and doesn't

1185.59 --> 1193.2099999999998
seem to be looking like that came to

1188.019 --> 1195.72
being as much as I had hoped but it

1193.21 --> 1195.72
might come back

1199.809 --> 1206.769
I think many people that awaken will be

1202.359 --> 1208.84
forced to learn it because yeah you're

1206.769 --> 1211.989
gonna be dealing with stresses from

1208.84 --> 1214.259
awakening and the opposition madness

1211.989 --> 1217.33
from the society that refuses to awake

1214.259 --> 1219.3990000000001
so yeah if you awake you're gonna have

1217.33 --> 1222.46
to deal with any emotions that you don't

1219.399 --> 1226.4399999999998
fully control yet because otherwise they

1222.46 --> 1226.44
will be used against you to destroy you

1234.299 --> 1236.929
dudes

1242.97 --> 1247.16
stop talking about that thank you

1265.87 --> 1271.08
stop it

1268.51 --> 1271.08
oops

1297.61 --> 1305.35
okay thank you for that anyway I don't

1303.1 --> 1307.3
do it don't talk about it on the show

1305.35 --> 1309.6399999999999
and if you want to really really really

1307.3 --> 1312.4199999999998

1309.64 --> 1312.42

year always oh yeah a lot too serious

1519.03 --> 1525.1
blows it's like 25 minutes from what I

1522.58 --> 1529.54
live so I talked to my wife she got off

1529.54 --> 1533.02
like 1:30 p.m. so yeah we'll be there on

1532.54 --> 1534.73
time

1533.02 --> 1538.69
she gave home you know change or

1534.73 --> 1540.88
whatever and take me over there would be

1538.69 --> 1542.5900000000001
right on time I'll take me a few

1540.88 --> 1544.8600000000001
pictures or a little bitty or something

1542.59 --> 1544.86
with them

1546.6 --> 1554.1299999999999
yeah that's awesome anywhere for a while

1551.91 --> 1557.01
but yeah maybe he's like somewhere in

1554.13 --> 1562.23
the spring or summer might actually go

1557.01 --> 1564.36
somewhere I'll be awesome yeah I would

1562.23 --> 1566.34
met anybody on the internet yet since I

1564.36 --> 1568.6499999999999
came to this cluttered neighborhood you

1566.34 --> 1570.27
know I'm gonna have that and talk

1568.65 --> 1572.0400000000002
face-to-face with a lot of people like

1570.27 --> 1574.08
you you know like I feel I know you you

1572.04 --> 1576.48
know like like you're cool but it is

1574.08 --> 1579.0
it's nicer in person you know to see

1576.48 --> 1580.5
show that I to iron feel each other you

1579.0 --> 1585.54
know who like for real you know what am

1580.5 --> 1589.47
i right yeah you can see more of the

1585.54 --> 1592.62
subtleties and things like for example I

1589.47 --> 1594.92
probably would not be as distracted as I

1592.62 --> 1597.54
typically tend to get during hangouts

1594.92 --> 1598.92
because yeah if you're just face to face

1597.54 --> 1601.83
with somebody you're not

1598.92 --> 1604.2
also moderating chat and trying to get

1601.83 --> 1607.8
the screen right all that you could just

1604.2 --> 1613.23
face the face and do that purely it's a

1607.8 --> 1614.97
difference exactly yeah and then my wife

1613.23 --> 1617.33
is gonna be there if we are talking

1614.97 --> 1619.92
let's say they say there's three people

1617.33 --> 1622.53
myself and my wife you know not be five

1619.92 --> 1623.76
of us so if somebody else is talking so

1622.53 --> 1625.11
I'll be just looking and paying

1623.76 --> 1627.17
attention to what they're saying and

1625.11 --> 1630.54
then my wife would be next to me

1627.17 --> 1632.0900000000001
imagining she we are home I'm sitting in

1630.54 --> 1634.77
the living room just looking forward

1632.09 --> 1636.6299999999999
with my headphones on and she be talking

1634.77 --> 1638.46
to me and I'm the laser and she to her

1636.63 --> 1640.98
because somebody else is talking and I

1638.46 --> 1642.75
got in my ears you know so Alicia she

1640.98 --> 1643.98
was gonna say like hold on wait a minute

1642.75 --> 1645.75
you know I'm listening to something like

1643.98 --> 1648.06
really important like give me one minute

1645.75 --> 1649.47
to finish on there Walter but she like

1648.06 --> 1651.72
you almost ignore me you never hear me

1649.47 --> 1653.64
say but you gotta tell me I got my

1651.72 --> 1654.68
headphones in my head you know like tell

1653.64 --> 1658.5900000000001
it to somebody

1654.68 --> 1660.93
double corner for us all to be there she

1658.59 --> 1665.04
sees what I listen to her what I do you

1660.93 --> 1666.96
know yeah how is your wife with the

1665.04 --> 1669.42
whole fire thing because last time we

1666.96 --> 1670.41
talked about that you mentioned that she

1669.42 --> 1675.18
really

1670.41 --> 1679.0800000000002
yet wasn't too sure about it how was

1675.18 --> 1682.8600000000001
that yeah the same cheese and I don't

1679.08 --> 1685.23
care about the subject sir she led me

1682.86 --> 1687.3899999999999
[ __ ] let me do my thing and she knows

1685.23 --> 1690.24
all the arguments for the flattered and

1687.39 --> 1692.49
I feel like two days ago I bought it

1690.24 --> 1694.53
again like personally like what do you

1692.49 --> 1695.94
think like I tell me you know what I say

1694.53 --> 1697.1399999999999
she said I understand everything it

1695.94 --> 1699.54
makes sense everything in the flatter

1697.14 --> 1699.96
and the globe model is broken is messed

1699.54 --> 1704.04
up

1699.96 --> 1705.63
he's got so many gaps and holes so there

1704.04 --> 1707.97
that's it I'm not gonna tell you what it

1705.63 --> 1709.65
is but that's my that's my opinion the

1707.97 --> 1711.8700000000001
globe is broken the Flat Earth make

1709.65 --> 1713.4
sense what you tell me and the people

1711.87 --> 1716.01
you talk to and you give me a summary

1713.4 --> 1717.75
make sense so that's my opinion and I

1716.01 --> 1720.99
don't want to talk about it anymore you

1717.75 --> 1723.63
know that's her opinion so yeah yeah I I

1720.99 --> 1725.28
said she's a closer at Florida that is

1723.63 --> 1727.8600000000001
really not interested in talking about

1725.28 --> 1730.37
the subject so a school yet oh yeah I

1727.86 --> 1730.37
lied it

1739.13 --> 1743.0300000000002
yep

1761.82 --> 1766.6789999999999
I was really up really early so my

1764.61 --> 1768.6
breakfast was also really early and now

1766.679 --> 1772.26
I'm figuring around like okay normally I

1768.6 --> 1774.12
would not be hungry right now we're

1772.26 --> 1776.309
starting to get hungry for lunch but I

1774.12 --> 1782.9289999999999
am really really hungry for lunch but

1776.309 --> 1782.9289999999999
yeah so what the show must go on

1784.82 --> 1792.51
and Ethan Nathan seems to be premiering

1788.45 --> 1798.47
daily now is he just cycling through all

1792.51 --> 1800.97
of his shows have you been following it

1798.47 --> 1803.549
yeah I've been watching a day in the

1800.97 --> 1806.46
daily basis for the last week week and a

1803.549 --> 1809.85
half yeah it's good I listen to them you

1806.46 --> 1811.8600000000001
know whenever I when this show ends the

1809.85 --> 1814.9499999999998
premiere is is rolling and I jump in

1811.86 --> 1817.29
there and I listen to it I don't shot a

1814.95 --> 1819.63
lot in the shot a little bit or Reese

1817.29 --> 1823.4099999999999
interesting to listen back to it shows

1819.63 --> 1826.3700000000001
from three four five months ago all

1823.41 --> 1829.02
right is it already to that point

1826.37 --> 1831.4799999999998
because yeah nathan has been going very

1829.02 --> 1833.61
long so I don't know does he skip

1831.48 --> 1834.72
through and just take out more

1833.61 --> 1838.28
interesting debates

1834.72 --> 1841.89
Oh from the last year or is he literally

1838.28 --> 1844.559
playing them one by one I haven't kept

1841.89 --> 1846.96
it right yeah I haven't pay a little

1844.559 --> 1850.32
attention because the thing is that I

1846.96 --> 1854.01
also when I'm at work I watched the

1850.32 --> 1856.23
older episodes of the flood debate so I

1854.01 --> 1859.3799999999999
was the older ones well above work and I

1856.23 --> 1865.65
kind of go in in in order I'm up to date

1859.38 --> 1868.91
206 206 and then I in the premiere is

1865.65 --> 1872.7800000000002
some of them are older than the closing

1868.91 --> 1872.78
some of them are newer

1874.309 --> 1881.6
okay so he does switch around

1878.3 --> 1882.53
make interesting shows yeah I think so

1881.6 --> 1885.02
yeah interesting

1882.53 --> 1886.97
maybe people tell me like it check this

1885.02 --> 1888.59
one out you know some character is in

1886.97 --> 1891.6200000000001
the show they're talking about this

1888.59 --> 1893.1799999999998
subject or this person was shinier than

1891.62 --> 1895.01
order you know destroyed all the water

1893.18 --> 1897.19
issues those because they are really

1895.01 --> 1900.35
interesting there was even playing here

1897.19 --> 1902.8400000000001
yeah I listened back to one of the shows

1900.35 --> 1905.48
but I don't listen to it every day it's

1902.84 --> 1909.35
just do other things but what's pretty

1905.48 --> 1913.16
cool up until I hurt myself it was like

1909.35 --> 1916.73
oh god so glad that I do a lot better

1913.16 --> 1922.13
than I do it did back then so annoying

1916.73 --> 1926.3
I can be simply right terrible but so

1922.13 --> 1929.47
could the others by the way we all had

1926.3 --> 1932.33
our issues that we had to work through

1929.47 --> 1934.04
over the entire debate period I am

1932.33 --> 1938.81
caught if I am horrible really sending

1934.04 --> 1941.3799999999999
back to myself what noble no you're

1938.81 --> 1943.97
you're doing fine

1941.38 --> 1946.93
you have been very consistent really

1943.97 --> 1946.93
from the start

1947.429 --> 1951.6290000000001
yeah I mean I saw I don't remember which

1950.999 --> 1954.059
one it is

1951.629 --> 1957.1789999999999
well the perspective was being taught in

1954.059 --> 1959.009
there in the show like to the nail and I

1957.179 --> 1961.3200000000002
go like this I got a little presentation

1959.009 --> 1963.1490000000001
in a piece of paper with the pencil

1961.32 --> 1965.549
that's kind of all the first times I

1963.149 --> 1967.4989999999998
showed in the show and I look at them

1965.549 --> 1970.019
and I go like hell am i doing showing

1967.499 --> 1972.33
drawing in a piece of paper and pencil

1970.019 --> 1975.119
but in the same bread I said that's

1972.33 --> 1978.059
really cool it's something that anybody

1975.119 --> 1979.6789999999999
can do you can observe something and

1978.059 --> 1982.799
then draw in a piece of paper and it

1979.679 --> 1985.2
will add up to is it is perspective what

1982.799 --> 1987.749
we're looking at then we read with an

1985.2 --> 1990.419
effect somewhere along the way in the

1987.749 --> 1994.83
little circular confusion you know which

1990.419 --> 1997.469
is what you interpret at the slant the

1994.83 --> 1999.6589999999999
optical zone they mirror me right so you

1997.469 --> 2002.019
know we all got our little terms yeah

1999.659 --> 2005.1490000000001
but that is what it is we do look

2002.019 --> 2008.44
perspective with an optical effect that

2005.149 --> 2011.4189999999999
we have to get you know to a certain

2008.44 --> 2015.979
agreement on how to describe right now

2011.419 --> 2018.8300000000002
the optical slant was purely it wasn't

2015.979 --> 2022.429
exactly trying to explain how it came to

2018.83 --> 2028.119
being it is mostly just trying to give a

2022.429 --> 2031.7
an objective analysis of how your eyes

2028.119 --> 2033.7389999999998
interpret it basically and that is the

2031.7 --> 2036.049
slant effect because yeah it is kind of

2033.739 --> 2038.059
folding into the horizon and then going

2036.049 --> 2040.519
on in a straight line that's not

2038.059 --> 2042.95
literally happening but that's just how

2040.519 --> 2047.02
it works optically and that's why it's

2042.95 --> 2051.399
an optical slant not a literal slant

2047.02 --> 2053.169
like yeah and it then or Eve or Eve has

2051.399 --> 2057.7
the same concept the same understanding

2053.169 --> 2059.98
on the Optus land but he is just ramble

2057.7 --> 2061.5699999999997
ramble ramble a lot and it's a lot

2059.98 --> 2063.73
harder to follow up on him

2061.57 --> 2066.55
yeah Wow he loves yourself you are

2063.73 --> 2069.61
consistent you know in a solid solid

2066.55 --> 2073.6290000000004
comes from sizes Benicia or lighter yet

2069.61 --> 2076.7200000000003
I try to but yeah it's a rave was also

2073.629 --> 2084.19
very infatuated with the dome know that

2076.72 --> 2086.1099999999997
so yeah for a few weeks ago he is active

2084.19 --> 2088.629
in the same pan the discord and all the

2086.11 --> 2090.76
discourse servers there's was his shine

2088.629 --> 2093.04
you know and he always with it because

2090.76 --> 2094.8990000000003
the firmament and the dome and the row

2093.04 --> 2097.5099999999998
bottom and these kind of the same you

2094.899 --> 2101.65
know she's holding on a lot to that I

2097.51 --> 2103.8100000000004
mean it's okay but it's too rambling

2101.65 --> 2105.76
ever changed you know rambling rambling

2103.81 --> 2108.52
about the dome he hasn't changed

2105.76 --> 2110.65
something we have to adapt and evolve in

2108.52 --> 2114.04
our argument because there are things

2110.65 --> 2116.29
that I thought a few months ago and I

2114.04 --> 2118.18
realize it's really not true so we have

2116.29 --> 2121.72
to evolve and say it's a little bit you

2118.18 --> 2124.96
know yeah and the dome everything that

2121.72 --> 2128.8199999999997
we when you assume a dome and you start

2124.96 --> 2131.619
to arrange your cosmo genie with that

2128.82 --> 2134.38
then you're using a presupposition of a

2131.619 --> 2137.4300000000003
dome because there is no evidence for it

2134.38 --> 2140.6800000000003
not any renewable evidence there's

2137.43 --> 2144.79
deductive based reasoning evidence for

2140.68 --> 2147.73
it well yeah that's not real real

2144.79 --> 2151.5099999999998
evidence so that's one of those things

2147.73 --> 2155.76
and just like a supposition of a of a

2151.51 --> 2159.1600000000003
spatial loop that's my presupposition

2155.76 --> 2161.53
yeah and it's okay yummy you can have it

2159.16 --> 2163.47
in and you can probably you can bring it

2161.53 --> 2166.63
to the table in any kind of presentation

2163.47 --> 2168.1
debate a lot of form but I think the

2166.63 --> 2170.8900000000003
most honest thing to do they say hey

2168.1 --> 2173.5899999999997
this is I believe you know my opinion my

2170.89 --> 2175.39
supposition you know it's not probing I

2173.59 --> 2178.32
don't have evidence for it but this is a

2175.39 --> 2180.4
very solid you know a very solid

2178.32 --> 2182.71
argument I had

2180.4 --> 2184.51
and this is why you know and it's good

2182.71 --> 2187.06
to put a little disclaimer like Jaron

2184.51 --> 2188.7700000000004
Jaron is a dome guy and I appreciate him

2187.06 --> 2191.14
because he put this it's clever he said

2188.77 --> 2192.28
this is this is my opinion you believe

2191.14 --> 2194.17
whatever you want

2192.28 --> 2196.48
I believe whatever I want and this is

2194.17 --> 2196.69
what I got for you you know I appreciate

2196.48 --> 2204.78
that

2196.69 --> 2204.78
I like these flamers before a claim I

2205.98 --> 2211.78
try not to I always stayed out of of

2209.32 --> 2214.06
making a claim of certainty believe I

2211.78 --> 2216.8500000000004
got I'm more open

2214.06 --> 2219.5499999999997
ayyyy guy and this is it this is only my

2216.85 --> 2223.24
my claim I have no proof or evidence for

2219.55 --> 2225.88
but I'm more of a million more to it is

2223.24 --> 2229.6899999999996
some kind of a pawn with the continents

2225.88 --> 2231.1600000000003
in there the eyes will be Antarctic ice

2229.69 --> 2233.68
holding the continents on the water

2231.16 --> 2235.42
together with some type of an AE it's

2233.68 --> 2237.1299999999997
gonna be a different setup on the

2235.42 --> 2239.77
continent it's not gonna be like a

2237.13 --> 2242.11
projection but this is just what I

2239.77 --> 2244.33
believe what I think I got no proof no

2242.11 --> 2247.3
evidence of it whatsoever you know

2244.33 --> 2249.31
actually that's far as I go a dome I

2247.3 --> 2251.86
have no idea I don't think so but maybe

2249.31 --> 2254.95
a gas pressure has to be contained

2251.86 --> 2257.05
somehow so you see the dome I really

2254.95 --> 2259.6299999999997
don't know is it gas everywhere until as

2257.05 --> 2262.6000000000004
far as we go and then that's it well

2259.63 --> 2264.1800000000003
probably the thing is even with the good

2262.6 --> 2268.12
the gradient and everything

2264.18 --> 2272.48
theoretically it could go on forever but

2268.12 --> 2278.48
only in one direction basically

2272.48 --> 2281.66
see yeah yeah agree and yeah that means

2278.48 --> 2285.14
there would be a huge amount of gas you

2281.66 --> 2290.6299999999997
know in this realm potentially infinite

2285.14 --> 2293.21
I don't know but yeah it is what it is

2290.63 --> 2295.76
and yeah maybe we will bump into

2293.21 --> 2298.31
something eventually at some point it's

2295.76 --> 2300.67
only one way to find out that is and

2298.31 --> 2305.2999999999997
that is to bump into it

2300.67 --> 2307.4300000000003
hey I was thinking about the video that

2305.3 --> 2308.9900000000002
I was talking about that I've watched

2307.43 --> 2312.23
earlier and did you take a look at that

2308.99 --> 2314.839
I posted it pretty much everywhere no I

2312.23 --> 2316.67
have not I was really busy from the

2314.839 --> 2319.099
whole day yesterday and today and I

2316.67 --> 2319.46
check on the Skype chat before I jump in

2319.099 --> 2321.349
here

2319.46 --> 2323.51
and there's a few videos people be

2321.349 --> 2326.51
posting from yesterday till today I

2323.51 --> 2331.3100000000004
didn't watch any alright I just posted

2326.51 --> 2334.13
right before I started up but yeah it

2331.31 --> 2337.7
had some theory an approach that

2334.13 --> 2341.96
suddenly gave me a very clear image as

2337.7 --> 2344.1189999999997
to how things might have caused the mud

2341.96 --> 2346.67
flood how that worked he had his own

2344.119 --> 2348.38
theory about it I don't know where he

2346.67 --> 2350.15
got that but it made a lot of sense and

2348.38 --> 2352.339
now I'm thinking about it and I can't

2350.15 --> 2355.4300000000003
get it out of my head and I like to hear

2352.339 --> 2361.339
your opinion about it so what there was

2355.43 --> 2363.49
supposedly a mini ice age in the 1700s

2361.339 --> 2365.68
right

2363.49 --> 2369.04
and there's paintings of this everything

2365.68 --> 2374.95
and the seas were frozen well consider

2369.04 --> 2378.19
that if for example during such an age

2374.95 --> 2381.7
there will be a lot of water turning

2378.19 --> 2384.61
into ice and might pile up so what if

2381.7 --> 2388.87
the Tarte Aryans to basically counter

2384.61 --> 2391.81
this cold used electro electric

2388.87 --> 2393.7599999999998
technology the ether technology as the

2391.81 --> 2398.71
government in this video specifically

2393.76 --> 2403.57
suggests and what if that would have

2398.71 --> 2407.34
caused a heat wave kind of locally and

2403.57 --> 2410.0800000000004
altogether caused the giant pile of ice

2407.34 --> 2414.4900000000002
that was basically caused during the

2410.08 --> 2416.92
mini ice age to melt and that because of

2414.49 --> 2420.1899999999996
this technology it all melted through

2416.92 --> 2424.1800000000003
very rapidly unexpectedly rapidly and

2420.19 --> 2427.18
then caused a local flood not super high

2424.18 --> 2430.0899999999997
not hundreds of meters but just this guy

2427.18 --> 2432.1
suggests 12 meters and that it was

2430.09 --> 2435.1000000000004
directly caused because of that just a

2432.1 --> 2437.7999999999997
very practical reason that was an

2435.1 --> 2442.86
unexpected side effect from applying all

2437.8 --> 2442.86
this technology what do you think

2443.0 --> 2448.1
it makes sense you know what I was yeah

2445.55 --> 2450.53
what speculated I was illustrating it in

2448.1 --> 2452.39
my mind the explanation you gave me from

2450.53 --> 2454.25
like I heard nothing before until what

2452.39 --> 2457.25
you get just pay the thing when you gave

2454.25 --> 2460.91
me like a mini-movie even said I mean it

2457.25 --> 2463.67
could be there's more there's more to it

2460.91 --> 2468.0499999999997
because it's also said that yeah after

2463.67 --> 2471.2000000000003
that barbarians came and overthrew the

2468.05 --> 2473.7200000000003
tert area so what if after this mud

2471.2 --> 2476.6299999999997
flood the majority of people around the

2473.72 --> 2478.6299999999997
world yeah they were basically yeah

2476.63 --> 2483.23
everything was ruined their houses were

2478.63 --> 2485.3
yeah destroyed or partially and they

2483.23 --> 2488.84
figured out yeah this is because of

2485.3 --> 2492.29
terraria we got flooded because of their

2488.84 --> 2495.53
technology and then they just massively

2492.29 --> 2499.15
stormed like from everywhere they just

2495.53 --> 2501.86
stormed all these Tartarian settlements

2499.15 --> 2503.53
maybe that is what really caused their

2501.86 --> 2507.4700000000003
downfall

2503.53 --> 2513.59
is there a demure graphical occasion as

2507.47 --> 2515.48
a revenge action for the mud flood is

2513.59 --> 2518.4500000000003
there a geographical location where this

2515.48 --> 2521.57
happened of this event is it near the

2518.45 --> 2526.6099999999997
coast in the in the Western war in the

2521.57 --> 2529.3700000000003
in Europe what do you mean oh this big

2526.61 --> 2532.48
event this dart area what is this what

2529.37 --> 2537.77
are the world attire it was said to be

2532.48 --> 2543.32
part of Eastern Europe and all of North

2537.77 --> 2545.48
Asia up into Alaska and that is probably

2543.32 --> 2548.09
only where it really came from because

2545.48 --> 2549.8
it suggested that they have been pretty

2548.09 --> 2552.7400000000002
much around the world there are [ __ ]

2549.8 --> 2557.0
architects have gone all over the world

2552.74 --> 2557.31
and built their style buildings and yeah

2557.0 --> 2560.34
there

2557.31 --> 2564.81
we wear but the original empire is

2560.34 --> 2570.26
supposedly in those regions in northern

2564.81 --> 2574.5299999999997
Russia what became Germany and Alaska

2570.26 --> 2577.92
all that so also so the three big claims

2574.53 --> 2581.01
as for evidence for distance area took

2577.92 --> 2583.62
place is the structures buried halfway

2581.01 --> 2586.5
that the second one is evidence some

2583.62 --> 2588.63
kind of evidence of issued to be

2586.5 --> 2591.12
technology advanced technology and the

2588.63 --> 2593.15
third one is remains of evidence of

2591.12 --> 2597.21
giants in this kind of the strongest

2593.15 --> 2599.82
things right yeah the giants that I have

2597.21 --> 2602.58
no idea if giants were part of that area

2599.82 --> 2605.46
I kind of think they were not really

2602.58 --> 2608.22
although okay I'm mixing it up yet dad

2605.46 --> 2611.94
look the Giants is the Atlantean age and

2608.22 --> 2615.66
that is way before all of this way

2611.94 --> 2617.76
before the mud flood in my view it's I'm

2615.66 --> 2619.6499999999996
still not conclusive about it all

2617.76 --> 2621.4500000000003
because yeah there's so much more to

2619.65 --> 2624.6
this mud flood than I thought originally

2621.45 --> 2627.1499999999996
I really have to figure things out like

2624.6 --> 2627.75
yeah what maybe I have to revise some

2627.15 --> 2630.51
things

2627.75 --> 2632.67
oh no figure it out but I haven't

2630.51 --> 2634.8300000000004
researched this whatsoever I have no

2632.67 --> 2637.2000000000003
idea I think I know more listening to

2634.83 --> 2639.0299999999997
you I haven't heard - Martin leak and he

2637.2 --> 2641.46
have been talking about this a lot very

2639.03 --> 2644.1600000000003
elaborate many people is onto this I try

2641.46 --> 2645.57
to just shake it shake it out and not

2644.16 --> 2647.73
even pay attention to this at all

2645.57 --> 2649.44
because I'm really not interested but

2647.73 --> 2651.48
that's my personal opinion you know and

2649.44 --> 2653.16
I look into it just for the hell of it

2651.48 --> 2656.1
to see what they Pro and the cons

2653.16 --> 2658.5
argument art is it's always good to

2656.1 --> 2661.44
entertain something and I think is my

2658.5 --> 2663.93
duty to take a look at it and think for

2661.44 --> 2666.81
myself and just come to a conclusion but

2663.93 --> 2669.3599999999997
as for right now I I can say I really

2666.81 --> 2672.42
don't know I just I'm just giving you my

2669.36 --> 2675.88
opinion with clueless or what what the

2672.42 --> 2677.529
research has been right yeah okay

2675.88 --> 2681.279
look into it then yeah there's not a lot

2677.529 --> 2686.65
of conclusions but I am interested very

2681.279 --> 2689.769
much in history and it's also because of

2686.65 --> 2692.4100000000003
this age and that that is my own insight

2689.769 --> 2695.319
on it and that is look in this age in

2692.41 --> 2699.339
this period more than ever we are losing

2695.319 --> 2703.029
we are being reprogrammed to lose our

2699.339 --> 2705.3089999999997
natural minds and our heritage and like

2703.029 --> 2708.609
throw everything overboard including

2705.309 --> 2711.5190000000002
common decency and all that crap so yeah

2708.609 --> 2715.839
if we want to kind of rebuild out of

2711.519 --> 2717.8799999999997
this cultural chaos then there needs to

2715.839 --> 2719.98
be something real to build on

2717.88 --> 2724.029
because if we're gonna build some new

2719.98 --> 2729.039
culture on misconceptions on elite

2724.029 --> 2732.789
created past lies then yeah that I doubt

2729.039 --> 2735.7000000000003
it's gonna work really it'd probably get

2732.789 --> 2737.529
corrupted eventually again so for me it

2735.7 --> 2742.049
is really trying to find a new anchor

2737.529 --> 2745.059
point a new beginning based in real

2742.049 --> 2748.93
ancient wisdom ancient culture spiritual

2745.059 --> 2751.6600000000003
culture and methodology that is good

2748.93 --> 2754.5389999999998
that is not the controlled opposition

2751.66 --> 2759.46
system the compartmentalization system

2754.539 --> 2762.13
the corruption system but yeah what was

2759.46 --> 2764.71
out there that this corruption system

2762.13 --> 2768.609
opposed and tried to completely

2764.71 --> 2771.91
annihilate and sort of succeeded but the

2768.609 --> 2775.39
remnants are now starting to float float

2771.91 --> 2779.859
and become noticed and we have the

2775.39 --> 2782.529
chance basically to revive this ancient

2779.859 --> 2783.46
way of doing things the right way you

2782.529 --> 2786.52
could call it

2783.46 --> 2788.68
or a better way at least and what what

2786.52 --> 2791.619
things are turning into now all this

2788.68 --> 2795.22
idiotic derailed madness that is being

2791.619 --> 2799.48
spread around culturally and all the

2795.22 --> 2801.609
lies so grateful if there are yeah so

2799.48 --> 2805.329
that's why I am particularly interested

2801.609 --> 2807.46
in the real past because yeah if you

2805.329 --> 2809.529
want to build something meaningful new a

2807.46 --> 2812.289
new culture a new direction a new vision

2809.529 --> 2815.289
a new way of doing things

2812.289 --> 2820.0890000000004
then it's best that you build those

2815.289 --> 2824.5890000000004
concepts on the real things so I gotta

2820.089 --> 2827.94
know I have to know to figure it out to

2824.589 --> 2831.52
find the right direction for Humanity or

2827.94 --> 2834.19
and part of humanity that is willing to

2831.52 --> 2837.309
do that and I think other people are

2834.19 --> 2840.339
looking for it too but I am just very

2837.309 --> 2844.15
aware of that that's going on and that

2840.339 --> 2846.43
that is necessary it's good that some of

2844.15 --> 2850.6600000000003
you are doing that you yourself general

2846.43 --> 2851.77
Jaron is a lot into old old story you

2850.66 --> 2854.92
know the backstory of

2851.77 --> 2857.079
this wherever we live in Martin is

2854.92 --> 2860.4700000000003
really good many people look back to the

2857.079 --> 2862.4500000000003
history of whatever is going on around

2860.47 --> 2865.029
here it's good because some people like

2862.45 --> 2866.799
me haven't had a clue on what's going on

2865.029 --> 2868.539
in the past and not really interested

2866.799 --> 2870.25
but it's good that you guys are doing it

2868.539 --> 2874.869
and that's why we all get our own pet

2870.25 --> 2878.319
and our own little grain of sand to do

2874.869 --> 2880.96
place in this biggest sea will live in

2878.319 --> 2883.839
you know right everybody figures out

2880.96 --> 2887.529
their own little part it is kind of

2883.839 --> 2891.0099999999998
natural compartmentalization but because

2887.529 --> 2893.77
it is voluntary based yeah you can't

2891.01 --> 2895.809
force people to go a presuppositional

2893.77 --> 2897.98
route as it were that's the big

2895.809 --> 2901.1090000000004
difference

2897.98 --> 2905.13
the decentralized nature of our group

2901.109 --> 2908.609
that allows us to continue maneuvering

2905.13 --> 2910.619
naturally and that is the big difference

2908.609 --> 2912.99
with a pyramid system with a

2910.619 --> 2916.26
compartmentalized need-to-know basis

2912.99 --> 2920.4799999999996
power structure in the decentralizing

2916.26 --> 2925.4100000000003
factor that is with us that prevents

2920.48 --> 2928.41
corruption yeah and I think the right

2925.41 --> 2930.5989999999997
thing to do the shoulder myself to you

2928.41 --> 2932.7599999999998
there if I get an advice if I could

2930.599 --> 2934.53
advise you in something is continue

2932.76 --> 2936.5400000000004
doing what are you doing I'm really not

2934.53 --> 2938.3100000000004
interested in but I don't I'm not gonna

2936.54 --> 2939.839
I'm not gonna burn you for what you do

2938.31 --> 2940.44
you know I'm not gonna insult you for

2939.839 --> 2946.7999999999997
what you do

2940.44 --> 2949.9500000000003
that's excellent awesome no no right to

2946.8 --> 2952.5890000000004
know nobody in a good way that's why no

2949.95 --> 2954.39
not in a I'm gonna that that's what

2952.589 --> 2955.98
that's what some people do they just

2954.39 --> 2958.17
insult each other they say you you're

2955.98 --> 2960.21
looking for this and this is [ __ ]

2958.17 --> 2961.7400000000002
and you're gonna get nowhere and [ __ ]

2960.21 --> 2964.71
these and some tie said no no no no

2961.74 --> 2966.5989999999997
you're looking into this uh-uh more

2964.71 --> 2968.43
power to you do it you know please do it

2966.599 --> 2970.349
but I'm really not interested somebody's

2968.43 --> 2972.8999999999996
okay to you yeah that's the positive

2970.349 --> 2974.46
approach that I take instead of just

2972.9 --> 2975.69
telling you your [ __ ] yourself I'm not

2974.46 --> 2978.21
gonna talk to you no more because you're

2975.69 --> 2980.19
looking into this you know right right

2978.21 --> 2982.53
help you understand you know yeah I have

2980.19 --> 2984.569
kind of the same thing with well so many

2982.53 --> 2987.9900000000002
people out there that are fighting the

2984.569 --> 2990.3
deep state it's like oh god it gets

2987.99 --> 2994.7599999999998
really annoying at times and it is kind

2990.3 --> 2997.4700000000003
of repetitive and very narrow in a way

2994.76 --> 2999.3900000000003
but yeah it's not my thing but I do

2997.47 --> 3002.2099999999996
appreciate that that is being done and I

2999.39 --> 3005.42
do believe it is necessary but it is

3002.21 --> 3008.27
just one little layer of that onion that

3005.42 --> 3011.69
we all need to be working through one of

3008.27 --> 3013.339
the the earlier layers and yeah that

3011.69 --> 3015.5
needs to be done I am NOT gonna be the

3013.339 --> 3018.23
person that is gonna be like oh this

3015.5 --> 3020.51
specific politician or we need to stop

3018.23 --> 3022.55
them because they're gonna destroy her

3020.51 --> 3025.67
you know that's not my job I will

3022.55 --> 3027.38
mention that yeah some of these liberal

3025.67 --> 3030.259
politicians are completely

3027.38 --> 3034.369
insane they're completely detached from

3030.259 --> 3036.859
the natural world as a human and you can

3034.369 --> 3039.17
and it shows it shows every time they

3036.859 --> 3041.39
try to do something in public and they

3039.17 --> 3044.089
just look awkward it terribly terribly

3041.39 --> 3047.779
awkward or or straight-out

3044.089 --> 3050.18
vile when they actually try to

3047.779 --> 3054.14
manipulate you with obvious lies it is

3050.18 --> 3058.549
vile very gives me the creeps when you

3054.14 --> 3061.779
do that so yeah that is there and it is

3058.549 --> 3064.579
necessary that they be dealt with and

3061.779 --> 3066.829
personally I think you probably get a

3064.579 --> 3069.1600000000003
little bit more harsh because it's just

3066.829 --> 3072.98
this open nastiness

3069.16 --> 3077.68
you know there's freedom and then there

3072.98 --> 3081.849
is just trying to protect the world from

3077.68 --> 3084.859
mental infection of insanity

3081.849 --> 3087.619
should I be one talking I'm talking

3084.859 --> 3090.5589999999997
about flatters do ya goodie so that

3087.619 --> 3093.1400000000003
sense you know there's gonna be people

3090.559 --> 3095.75
that will love to abuse that level of

3093.14 --> 3098.269
approach to get their religious

3095.75 --> 3102.98
opponents out of the way as well so we

3098.269 --> 3105.2889999999998
got to be very careful with that what

3102.98 --> 3109.9
when a change change a little subject a

3105.289 --> 3114.5
little bit here when when do you came to

3109.9 --> 3117.2000000000003
visualize this rectangular looking type

3114.5 --> 3119.99
of model was it when you came across

3117.2 --> 3124.3689999999997
platter about three four years ago or do

3119.99 --> 3126.2889999999998
you get this idea before that sorry I

3124.369 --> 3129.319
was a bit distracted by Nathan what did

3126.289 --> 3131.119
you say again right when do you when do

3129.319 --> 3133.279
you start visualizing this rectangular

3131.119 --> 3134.9300000000003
looping model of viewers when you came

3133.279 --> 3138.289
through fluttered three and four years

3134.93 --> 3141.1699999999996
ago or was it a long before that when

3138.289 --> 3143.599
you start visualize it's very

3141.17 --> 3145.759
complicated it's very very complicated

3143.599 --> 3149.509
but yeah I mentioned the earlier yet I

3145.759 --> 3152.78
did see it envisioned it in the big one

3149.509 --> 3158.27
so yeah it was there but

3152.78 --> 3160.5800000000004
I I don't know yeah you don't know why

3158.27 --> 3163.0099999999998
onward they are yeah yes you didn't know

3160.58 --> 3166.37
I look about it I looked at my own mind

3163.01 --> 3169.0400000000004
and I don't know if it came into being

3166.37 --> 3172.52
because of my visions or that my visions

3169.04 --> 3176.12
was simply taking a look at it coming

3172.52 --> 3179.81
into being naturally I don't know that's

3176.12 --> 3181.6099999999997
one of the confusing things of like yeah

3179.81 --> 3184.94
when you do things that are not

3181.61 --> 3187.58
completely tied in with linear time it's

3184.94 --> 3191.4500000000003
very confusing I don't know I just know

3187.58 --> 3195.35
that it hit me the rectangular looping

3191.45 --> 3198.7999999999997
concept hit me and I always felt there

3195.35 --> 3202.3399999999997
it needs to be explored especially

3198.8 --> 3204.6800000000003
because it is so confusing there's a lot

3202.34 --> 3208.7000000000003
of people that just push away because

3204.68 --> 3210.95
there is no infinite physical literalism

3208.7 --> 3214.37
where everything is exactly as you think

3210.95 --> 3218.3199999999997
it is especially that's the first thing

3214.37 --> 3222.1099999999997
that it overthrows because it has to and

3218.32 --> 3224.9900000000002
yeah you get in a kind of similar Tory

3222.11 --> 3226.9300000000003
mindset because of this because yeah

3224.99 --> 3229.7299999999996
different thing you're looping earth

3226.93 --> 3231.7999999999997
when you kind of were actively think

3229.73 --> 3235.67
about it it is kind of like a simulation

3231.8 --> 3237.77
and it could be simulated in a computer

3235.67 --> 3239.69
technically up to a certain degree

3237.77 --> 3243.77
depending on how deep you want to go

3239.69 --> 3248.27
with that but yeah but I just think that

3243.77 --> 3251.3
our physical reality is similar Tory in

3248.27 --> 3252.53
nature not a simulation that is not real

3251.3 --> 3257.02
it is real

3252.53 --> 3257.02
what it is civil a Tory it was

3258.01 --> 3267.4900000000002
designed and created from a simulation

3262.41 --> 3270.1
angle that's what I think really and so

3267.49 --> 3275.3199999999997
when you're being just completely agrees

3270.1 --> 3277.06
with that okay so when you heard about

3275.32 --> 3278.9500000000003
flattered and you did a little research

3277.06 --> 3281.5299999999997
you felt compelled you say this is see

3278.95 --> 3284.9199999999996
this is what I'm gonna speak my mind and

3281.53 --> 3288.8500000000004
let the world knows who I am no no no

3284.92 --> 3290.6800000000003
when I first saw it I was terrified I'm

3288.85 --> 3293.49
being honest I was terrified and

3290.68 --> 3296.1
fascinated because yeah as I said before

3293.49 --> 3299.22
during the visions during my past

3296.1 --> 3304.8399999999997
especially during the visions Flat Earth

3299.22 --> 3307.8599999999997
was you were people were threatened over

3304.84 --> 3312.1600000000003
that I was threatened over it severely

3307.86 --> 3313.84
severely during vision experience and it

3312.16 --> 3315.85
was terrifying to see it but on the

3313.84 --> 3321.4
other hand is like wow this is an

3315.85 --> 3325.45
opening to the to escape the illusion of

3321.4 --> 3328.2400000000002
the controllers and that is what I felt

3325.45 --> 3331.33
more than actually the globe is alive

3328.24 --> 3334.33
but I just felt like this is something

3331.33 --> 3336.58
new that'll allow me to escape the

3334.33 --> 3340.45
illusion of the controllers the illusion

3336.58 --> 3346.0
that they managed to control us and

3340.45 --> 3348.79
that's what I felt and I just my

3346.0 --> 3351.51
enthusiasm basically overtook my fear

3348.79 --> 3354.13
and that's how I came onto the scene and

3351.51 --> 3357.1000000000004
it you have to be fair in my first

3354.13 --> 3358.87
hangout it's weird

3357.1 --> 3362.35
thinking back about it I don't know if

3358.87 --> 3364.3599999999997
you could even see it but I was kind of

3362.35 --> 3367.39
suppressing being terrified

3364.36 --> 3369.19
not because of performance anxiety but

3367.39 --> 3372.94
because I was fearing the consequences

3369.19 --> 3377.08
on the long run what letting myself get

3372.94 --> 3379.3
engaged with this would cause and I over

3377.08 --> 3381.5499999999997
dramatize this because yeah there's of

3379.3 --> 3384.4900000000002
course the more social societal

3381.55 --> 3386.3300000000004
consequences friends and blah but yeah

3384.49 --> 3389.0
it wasn't in a position to lose a lot

3386.33 --> 3390.98
friends back then everything crashed

3389.0 --> 3397.22
around me that's how I ended up here in

3390.98 --> 3399.83
Utrecht and but yeah I was very scared

3397.22 --> 3402.47
like an instant maybe it was kind of the

3399.83 --> 3404.63
baller fear instinctive fear you know

3402.47 --> 3407.33
that some ballers have but it was

3404.63 --> 3411.32
conscious it was not a subconscious fear

3407.33 --> 3413.96
it was literally remembering from my

3411.32 --> 3415.2200000000003
visions like yeah if you go there then

3413.96 --> 3419.54
we're gonna haunt you

3415.22 --> 3422.72
we're gonna attack you and this kind of

3419.54 --> 3426.11
is on the other side going on and that's

3422.72 --> 3428.99
one of the things I very thankful for

3426.11 --> 3432.32
having my healer to support me and he

3428.99 --> 3435.29
conquers weirdly enough not believing

3432.32 --> 3437.9
Flat Earth what he conquers like yeah

3435.29 --> 3440.66
whatever you're doing I don't need to

3437.9 --> 3443.96
know but keep it up because yeah you are

3440.66 --> 3445.7
being targeted by dark entities and I'm

3443.96 --> 3448.7
helping you protect it and then he's

3445.7 --> 3451.3399999999997
teaching me basically to take over what

3448.7 --> 3454.43
he does to learn that skill as well so I

3451.34 --> 3458.03
won't need anyone anymore and I can just

3454.43 --> 3461.0899999999997
purge myself of all these dark ties from

3458.03 --> 3466.7900000000004
yeah spirits that try to invade you

3461.09 --> 3470.42
through other people try to slip in in

3466.79 --> 3472.67
typically social nasty moments like this

3470.42 --> 3475.27
kind of thing is can be extremely subtle

3472.67 --> 3478.37
it doesn't have to be like some extreme

3475.27 --> 3479.87
extremity where like violence or

3478.37 --> 3483.92
whatever is present now it can be a

3479.87 --> 3486.38
person that is just dwelling because of

3483.92 --> 3490.1
being programmed by society to not think

3486.38 --> 3491.75
naturally that will have these aromanian

3490.1 --> 3494.27
entities as I call them these extra

3491.75 --> 3496.85
dimensional entities slipping into their

3494.27 --> 3499.58
subconscious and screwing around and

3496.85 --> 3502.37
then suddenly if you as such a person

3499.58 --> 3505.99
with entities and yeah a lot of people

3502.37 --> 3508.16
almost everyone in the world as entities

3505.99 --> 3511.2799999999997
doing that kind of thing to them they

3508.16 --> 3512.1499999999996
get involved everywhere they can it's

3511.28 --> 3513.59
natural

3512.15 --> 3516.08
that's the weird thing it's

3513.59 --> 3518.21
it sounds creepy it's like oh my god

3516.08 --> 3520.19
ghosts may be real and suddenly when you

3518.21 --> 3521.57
realize that all then ghosts are at

3520.19 --> 3525.26
around every corner you're gonna panic

3521.57 --> 3528.71
well this is that this is just going on

3525.26 --> 3530.75
there and you don't have to be afraid

3528.71 --> 3533.18
necessarily of it but you have to deal

3530.75 --> 3535.79
with it because people that have these

3533.18 --> 3538.3399999999997
entities in them and it's not like ooh

3535.79 --> 3540.74
demonic possession at all oh yeah if you

3538.34 --> 3543.4700000000003
type extremely far it could probably be

3540.74 --> 3544.9399999999996
that this is very minor but people that

3543.47 --> 3549.47
have these entities riding along with

3544.94 --> 3552.2000000000003
them they can have very sudden nasty

3549.47 --> 3554.6
behaviors out of nowhere against people

3552.2 --> 3557.8599999999997
like me who are trying to be extremely

3554.6 --> 3560.39
pure and not engaging in society not

3557.86 --> 3564.23
sacrificing to the Beast basically and

3560.39 --> 3566.06
yet people will just be like suddenly

3564.23 --> 3568.28
the jealous out of nowhere even though

3566.06 --> 3569.93
they have no idea who I am and that I'm

3568.28 --> 3572.9900000000002
actually kind of poor that kind of thing

3569.93 --> 3576.89
and this happens it doesn't happen a lot

3572.99 --> 3581.4799999999996
but it does happen tends to happen when

3576.89 --> 3585.3199999999997
I go in places where I haven't been

3581.48 --> 3588.05
before or that I just rarely go but the

3585.32 --> 3591.59
places that I trust that I go a lot I

3588.05 --> 3593.9300000000003
somehow yeah integrate my energy in

3591.59 --> 3596.84
these locations and I don't get that

3593.93 --> 3601.58
kind of response from people so people

3596.84 --> 3603.23
don't give me an STI ever in the places

3601.58 --> 3605.48
that I go regularly and that's of course

3603.23 --> 3609.2
also because I get to know the people I

3605.48 --> 3612.26
really I speak Thai at first I'm just

3609.2 --> 3615.1699999999996
staring like okay when I come in a place

3612.26 --> 3618.05
newly like say my the organic

3615.17 --> 3620.66
supermarket that I go daily almost at

3618.05 --> 3622.52
first it's like okay I hope they don't

3620.66 --> 3624.29
think I'm too scary or something and

3622.52 --> 3628.1
yeah I'm kind of close I'm really

3624.29 --> 3628.98
nervous new people new city but yeah

3628.1 --> 3631.5
over the

3628.98 --> 3633.66
I've gotten to know almost everyone and

3631.5 --> 3636.45
they can just see like oh this is a new

3633.66 --> 3639.66
a new employee and I just took them hey

3636.45 --> 3641.8199999999997
when did you start and your name and

3639.66 --> 3643.74
yeah what do you think about organic

3641.82 --> 3645.81
food there's so much I can talk about

3643.74 --> 3651.1499999999996
with people that work there and they

3645.81 --> 3654.2999999999997
really appreciate it and yeah that kind

3651.15 --> 3658.02
of gives this energy blanket so I'm not

3654.3 --> 3660.3590000000004
vulnerable so somebody that may have

3658.02 --> 3661.77
these entities hidden within them those

3660.359 --> 3663.48
entities are not going to come out

3661.77 --> 3665.28
they're not going to be able to it's

3663.48 --> 3666.09
only when I'm vulnerable that that is

3665.28 --> 3669.7200000000003
able to happen

3666.09 --> 3672.54
it's fascinating I study it deeply these

3669.72 --> 3674.8799999999997
details of how that works and the

3672.54 --> 3676.8
experiences themselves and the results

3674.88 --> 3679.77
of them because yeah when I do get

3676.8 --> 3682.8900000000003
attacked by these nasty spirits that are

3679.77 --> 3686.13
just present almost everywhere and they

3682.89 --> 3689.8199999999997
do touch me then it's you I can feel it

3686.13 --> 3691.56
I can feel it it it's literally like

3689.82 --> 3693.3590000000004
they're tapping into my energy and I

3691.56 --> 3695.7
don't have it all available to me and

3693.359 --> 3699.96
I'm spiritually not as dynamic as I

3695.7 --> 3703.6189999999997
naturally am and well I'm learning to to

3699.96 --> 3705.869
deal with that not to let it be but to

3703.619 --> 3708.54
purge it every time purge all these dark

3705.869 --> 3711.03
connections all these attempts from

3708.54 --> 3715.47
outside and maneuver me to corrupt me

3711.03 --> 3717.27
whatever it's a very a very ethereal

3715.47 --> 3720.0299999999997
subject so maybe you've just fallen

3717.27 --> 3722.04
asleep Jose I don't know I'm listening

3720.03 --> 3723.4500000000003
to you this is deep [ __ ] you know it's

3722.04 --> 3725.0099999999998
interesting you know appreciate it

3723.45 --> 3730.71
appreciate it all right yeah it is very

3725.01 --> 3733.38
ethereal it is it is it is kind of extra

3730.71 --> 3735.7200000000003
dimensional in a way but they're they're

3733.38 --> 3738.84
the the I Romanians and the Luciferian

3735.72 --> 3740.85
spirits they're there and they're very

3738.84 --> 3744.9900000000002
different but they all do the same

3740.85 --> 3746.97
things every month and and those spirits

3744.99 --> 3749.6699999999996
they're just destroyers they take away

3746.97 --> 3750.6
your hope they take away your will take

3749.67 --> 3753.27
away your pleasure

3750.6 --> 3755.5499999999997
and the Luciferians they do exactly the

3753.27 --> 3757.92
opposite they seduced the hell out of

3755.55 --> 3762.38
you and they make you feel like you can

3757.92 --> 3765.87
do anything and they turn you into and

3762.38 --> 3768.9
they give you megalomania and they make

3765.87 --> 3769.5299999999997
you destroy the things you love Auto

3768.9 --> 3772.4700000000003
mania

3769.53 --> 3776.1000000000004
that's manic everything Luciferian is

3772.47 --> 3781.47
basically a manic seduction to surrender

3776.1 --> 3784.3199999999997
to the beautiful beautiful energy that

3781.47 --> 3786.81
you can't actually handle that is what

3784.32 --> 3789.6600000000003
the Luciferian spirits do quite the

3786.81 --> 3792.99
opposite from the aromanians so and this

3789.66 --> 3795.6
is yeah you can actually find books on

3792.99 --> 3797.5499999999997
this lore that treat this lore and you

3795.6 --> 3803.46
will find them in the rule of Steiner

3797.55 --> 3806.4
Department because most of this these

3803.46 --> 3808.02
detailed analysis of these spirits and

3806.4 --> 3808.59
what they do and how they influence that

3808.02 --> 3812.28
comes

3808.59 --> 3814.98
that's his heritage he he figured that

3812.28 --> 3816.51
out with his with the people that he

3814.98 --> 3819.05
dealt with and he was a very special

3816.51 --> 3819.05
person

3821.22 --> 3827.22
a lot of interesting stuff man let me

3825.45 --> 3834.21
see if I can find a good photograph of

3827.22 --> 3837.24
him yeah and from this same Rudolf

3834.21 --> 3839.369
Steiner and the entropy so and drop us a

3837.24 --> 3843.81
fee I don't even know how to pronounce

3839.369 --> 3846.869
it in English but that's also the same

3843.81 --> 3850.68
direction in which Germany medicine was

3846.869 --> 3854.79
developed technology to use subtle

3850.68 --> 3859.2799999999997
resonance to heal people and to

3854.79 --> 3861.9
neutralize negative influences on a

3859.28 --> 3864.3900000000003
technological skill that also came from

3861.9 --> 3870.109
that same stem it's an incredible

3864.39 --> 3870.109
resource that oil snake juice

3872.9 --> 3879.2000000000003
make oil juice from Virgin snakes

3880.43 --> 3885.33
right

3883.02 --> 3889.13

3885.33 --> 3892.59
very German any loss chairman let's see

3889.13 --> 3895.7290000000003

3892.59 --> 3895.7290000000003
[Music]

3897.609 --> 3905.5299999999997
yeah okay I'm gonna present it through

3903.14 --> 3905.5299999999997
Google Hangouts

3909.2 --> 3914.96

3911.94 --> 3914.96
that's the guy

3916.28 --> 3922.86
presentation

3918.3 --> 3928.53
as a yes I see I see I thought I was a

3922.86 --> 3932.88
mute so that's a real person he's real 9

3928.53 --> 3938.0600000000004
3 20 century guy I think or or late 19th

3932.88 --> 3938.06
I'm not sure me let me recheck

3941.13 --> 3946.4100000000003
yeah when he was young it looks like a

3944.13 --> 3948.27
natural look at the top right the top

3946.41 --> 3950.1299999999997
right one he looks like an actor I don't

3948.27 --> 3952.56
know the name but he looks like in that

3950.13 --> 3956.69
picture in the top right he looks like

3952.56 --> 3956.69
an actor yeah

3959.31 --> 3964.83
uh h-he changed a lot in the way he

3963.45 --> 3971.7599999999998
looked over his age look there's a

3964.83 --> 3976.02
really young photograph here that no

3971.76 --> 3982.9700000000003
idea what he's doing there let's see let

3976.02 --> 3990.99
me wiki him oh wow okay

3982.97 --> 3993.41
1861 290 25 so yeah he pretty much left

3990.99 --> 3996.2999999999997
this world right before World War or

3993.41 --> 4002.0
yeah before the Nazis started screwing

3996.3 --> 4004.27
everything up I guess he left just in

4002.0 --> 4004.27
time

4004.72 --> 4011.87
every last belong was 63 57 years old no

4009.65 --> 4015.62

4011.87 --> 4020.44
too and of course the entrepot soft

4015.62 --> 4024.3199999999997
across society person to have ever lived

4020.44 --> 4028.1
120 years see spiritual research as at

4024.32 --> 4030.11
Eric school it's safe to say that the

4028.1 --> 4033.25
more fundamentalist Christians don't

4030.11 --> 4033.25
really like this guy a lot

4033.67 --> 4042.07
he's a way to develop outside of their

4036.86 --> 4046.54
framework yeah but the truth is is

4042.07 --> 4046.54
philosophically hope you know that face

4047.41 --> 4050.41
yeah

4054.75 --> 4060.4
yeah yeah but somehow you advertise this
