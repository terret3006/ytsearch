135.819 --> 145.45
first let me of course show you the

140.29 --> 152.04999999999998
weather which is quite beautiful maybe

145.45 --> 160.10999999999999
even more so than yesterday there's just

152.05 --> 162.70000000000002
no clouds at all though yeah maybe

160.11 --> 164.56
because it's now warmer there's more

162.7 --> 168.13
moist in the air so it looks a little

164.56 --> 173.2
bit more like a grayish soup at the

168.13 --> 175.0
horizon instead of that pure blue but I

173.2 --> 180.569
think that's just due to the temperature

175.0 --> 180.569
change it's just really nice weather

181.08 --> 185.59
when there's a bit of wind it is still

183.64 --> 187.77999999999997
kind of fresh but there's not so much

185.59 --> 189.579
and there's just the whole periods where

187.78 --> 194.1
there's just no air movement at all is

189.579 --> 194.1
really nice and warm and so yeah

196.78 --> 208.489

289.57 --> 297.21999999999997
to me the supposed up votes in the end

293.349 --> 299.71
what remains and the amount of views it

297.22 --> 303.19000000000005
to me it's all really just secondary

299.71 --> 307.15
because I know you guys are there I know

303.19 --> 309.669
that well I'm pretty sure you're all

307.15 --> 312.25

by your own choice and you're here to

312.25 --> 320.949
learn and you're not some BOTS or some

315.34 --> 325.06
AI you know the no way and plenty of you

320.949 --> 328.36
and it's awesome like I really got a

325.06 --> 330.699
crowd even though it's not huge it's not

328.36 --> 335.8
like overwhelming my chat with all kinds

330.699 --> 339.48900000000003
of people you know I know you guys and

344.089 --> 357.259
bhakta Missouri bear I know yeah it's

355.58 --> 360.099
just funny because in the beginning I

357.259 --> 364.189
wasn't all that sure about everyone you

360.099 --> 366.93899999999996
know there was a lot of nuttiness going

364.189 --> 371.209
around and I do think there are like

366.939 --> 375.019
fake but type characters in between

371.209 --> 376.999
things over at certain places it's it's

375.019 --> 379.449
hard to spot it's like they just sneak

376.999 --> 379.449
in there

384.31 --> 396.43
ooh thank you for the 679 pence is that

394.06 --> 402.31

402.31 --> 410.44
pence super Chad donation it's an oakley

406.33 --> 416.10999999999996
90 80 thank you very much right so I did

410.44 --> 418.39
post a video earlier and there seems to

416.11 --> 419.74
be a lot of these coming out in in the

418.39 --> 421.95
more recent times it's kind of

419.74 --> 424.78000000000003
interesting it's just that all these

421.95 --> 428.68
German doctors they're all German

424.78 --> 431.71
speaking and they're all just coming out

428.68 --> 434.14
with their interpretation of the

431.71 --> 438.94
situation concerning corona and it's all

434.14 --> 442.36
very elaborate and it's pretty good it

438.94 --> 444.61
it doesn't even necessarily address like

442.36 --> 447.07
our virus is real although some of them

444.61 --> 450.1
do in a way and do kind of say yeah it's

447.07 --> 453.13
just not as straightforward infecting

450.1 --> 455.95000000000005
agent as you think and just a very

453.13 --> 458.05
sensible wide perspective on the

455.95 --> 463.03
situation and that societal consequences

458.05 --> 464.8
and statistics and yet today on a Dutch

463.03 --> 467.44
website I found another one of these

464.8 --> 472.06
that was linked through by another

467.44 --> 474.31
article and I posted it so it was just

472.06 --> 475.84
ten minutes so that's why I posted it 20

474.31 --> 477.669
minutes before the show started so I

475.84 --> 480.42999999999995
thought everybody that was there could

477.669 --> 482.38
take a look and it was really good you

480.43 --> 484.18
did have to turn on the YouTube

482.38 --> 488.89
subtitles though because it didn't have

484.18 --> 491.52
baked in subtitles because it's all

488.89 --> 491.52
German spoken

492.74 --> 497.52
but yeah it's it's good to see more of

495.569 --> 499.259
these coming out and yeah I don't know

497.52 --> 501.719
you learn a lot everybody has this

499.259 --> 504.8
opportunity with these people coming out

501.719 --> 510.419
to learn a lot about the situation and

504.8 --> 513.36
then of course also not too long before

510.419 --> 515.8489999999999
my show started reptile philosophy had a

513.36 --> 518.19
deal live stream oh I think he do all

515.849 --> 520.4590000000001
streamed he was on deal life had a lot

518.19 --> 527.5790000000001
of connection problems and he was just

520.459 --> 530.91
out there I think in his car and he was

527.579 --> 533.55
just ya sharing his experience with

530.91 --> 536.6
what's out there and all these basically

533.55 --> 539.459
this silly and crazy and fearful people

536.6 --> 542.73
wearing the corona masks and how silly

539.459 --> 548.6099999999999
that really is and yeah it's good to see

542.73 --> 551.5500000000001
good to see some some testimony from his

548.61 --> 553.41
side as to how Americans are responding

551.55 --> 557.6099999999999
to this because I have seen a lot of

553.41 --> 559.8
people with masks on as well like even

557.61 --> 562.62
in the in the grocery store where I

559.8 --> 565.829
typically go and that the most typical

562.62 --> 571.279
was is that it was people then I've

565.829 --> 571.279
never seen that before so

572.32 --> 579.1
yeah I could have been all kinds of it

574.6 --> 582.07
could have been people that basically

579.1 --> 584.86
just now decided to go organic but

582.07 --> 586.779
overall so into the whole Corona Fair

584.86 --> 588.5500000000001
thing and they just thought no I have to

586.779 --> 592.0
or you're getting now or I'm gonna die

588.55 --> 594.13
or something and then they come to that

592.0 --> 597.49
grocery store instead of I don't know

594.13 --> 598.99
where they usually go I don't know but

597.49 --> 601.779
I've seen a lot of people that I've

598.99 --> 605.769
never seen before in even my grocery

601.779 --> 610.24
store the organic grocery store here and

605.769 --> 613.42
yeah some people wearing masks and yeah

610.24 --> 617.019
not just like for example Asian people

613.42 --> 620.4699999999999
now the weird thing is even in the past

617.019 --> 621.88
years I would sometimes see Asian people

620.47 --> 624.85
I take it there's like Chinese or

621.88 --> 627.519
something or Korean I don't know that

624.85 --> 630.4590000000001
had face masks so they were already kind

627.519 --> 633.73
of into that like as a standard

630.459 --> 636.76
protection measure and to see that

633.73 --> 638.8290000000001
wasn't even that shocking you know

636.76 --> 641.29
because they had to do with like the

638.829 --> 643.6899999999999
SARS outbreak and a lot of Chinese

641.29 --> 646.6899999999999
people then just started to wear masks

643.69 --> 651.5100000000001
even here not all of them you know but

646.69 --> 654.85
it happened but now it's also just I

651.51 --> 661.62
don't know you blatantly non-asian

654.85 --> 661.62
people white people usually women

662.19 --> 666.3290000000001
haven't seen any men do it

667.11 --> 671.25
and yeah

673.899 --> 679.54
yeah anyway it is it seems to be

677.23 --> 682.66
happening and it is odd and in a weird

679.54 --> 684.73
way you know what I've been subjected to

682.66 --> 687.61
some predictive programming when it

684.73 --> 689.8000000000001
comes to these freaking masks this is

687.61 --> 694.649
this is another weird are winning oddity

689.8 --> 700.269
but yeah I used to go to gothic parties

694.649 --> 704.95
and guess what among them there is like

700.269 --> 707.26
a certain type of style it's and a big

704.95 --> 711.22
part of that is freaking wearing facial

707.26 --> 713.35
masks so I've been seeing that a lot and

711.22 --> 715.51
I even asked some of those people and

713.35 --> 717.01
they did say like yeah that everybody's

715.51 --> 721.56
gonna wear it in the future because of

717.01 --> 724.0
the virus it's like what people are not

721.56 --> 727.51
this yeah

724.0 --> 730.2
and that was like ten years ago or

727.51 --> 730.2
something it's just

733.79 --> 737.8
it's weird to see this happen

748.77 --> 751.86
[Music]

755.49 --> 762.57
hmm by the way thank you Nathan Oakley

758.8 --> 766.0899999999999

762.57 --> 769.33
thank you John M for the two Canadian

super super head Canadian dollar super

769.33 --> 774.97
chat donation thank you very much

770.89 --> 780.37
watch the video of new baby Q Austin

774.97 --> 785.74
Stein Bart what what is that I have no

780.37 --> 789.99
idea I get the feeling I don't want to

785.74 --> 789.99
know but I know it might be funny

794.24 --> 803.75
all right stop Robbin Stanley you have

796.82 --> 806.57
been hearing about that it's like you

803.75 --> 809.93
know what this in a way reminds me of it

806.57 --> 814.7600000000001
is so odd it is it reminds me in a way a

809.93 --> 817.1899999999999
bit about what I learned because I was

814.76 --> 821.12
into that British history like

817.19 --> 825.86
concerning around World War two and like

821.12 --> 827.9590000000001
food the state effort like everybody not

825.86 --> 831.47
that you like we're under war threat and

827.959 --> 834.38
then yeah the queen or king just

831.47 --> 836.149
basically lays out like okay we have to

834.38 --> 838.76
do this now to save the country

836.149 --> 841.61
it's like George your duty to the

838.76 --> 843.5889999999999
country and yeah that worked sort of

841.61 --> 846.23
also made a lot of huge mistakes of

843.589 --> 849.8000000000001
course concerning farming a lot of

846.23 --> 858.11
farming was ruined because of the use of

849.8 --> 860.209
excess the artificial fertilizer that's

858.11 --> 861.86
also a well known thing that

860.209 --> 864.38
unfortunately happened because of that

861.86 --> 868.19
but like it almost seems like they're

864.38 --> 870.5889999999999
now trying to like do that again in

868.19 --> 873.08
response to this corona and like see if

870.589 --> 876.98
they can get the urgency through to just

873.08 --> 883.94
make people get their efforts together

876.98 --> 886.76
and pretty much yeah through you call it

883.94 --> 888.7090000000001
through their patriotism to starts

886.76 --> 890.95
basically helping out and now these

888.709 --> 893.93
masks are getting produced this way by

890.95 --> 895.9100000000001
by manufacturers that don't originally

893.93 --> 899.5699999999999
produce them but do have kind of have

895.91 --> 903.89
the capability to do it and yeah it did

899.57 --> 908.6600000000001
it's it feels to me like a almost a

903.89 --> 911.75
retro patriotic war response effort type

908.66 --> 916.55
of thing guys am I the only one that

911.75 --> 917.56
feels this correlation oh by the way I

916.55 --> 921.55

because I don't know phone me connection

1029.67 --> 1038.25
so far I don't know why but yeah

1034.16 --> 1044.67
sous-sous PayPal donations basically

1038.25 --> 1046.949
work the same way but yet to get that

1044.67 --> 1049.14
fresh air system which I really do want

1046.949 --> 1053.04
to and it's kind of interesting in

1049.14 --> 1055.1100000000001
retrospect also in the video that I

1053.04 --> 1058.8899999999999
posted earlier from the doctor he did

1055.11 --> 1060.9599999999998
also mention about general air quality

1058.89 --> 1064.47
conditions in these regions in North

1060.96 --> 1067.08
Italy and in Wuhan China he brought that

1064.47 --> 1070.74
up specifically and he said well because

1067.08 --> 1074.97
of the industry there and the poor job

1070.74 --> 1077.34
of filtering out the the pollution which

1074.97 --> 1080.6100000000001
includes also dusts and all kinds of

1077.34 --> 1085.77
things that is actually what aggravates

1080.61 --> 1090.8999999999999
the symptoms and yeah that just made me

1085.77 --> 1093.54
realize I I really want a one that

1090.9 --> 1097.1100000000001
functions again again the the dust you

1093.54 --> 1103.08
know in the morning when the Sun shines

1097.11 --> 1106.29
through the window I do see dust and I

1103.08 --> 1108.4199999999998
don't like seeing that now in a way it's

1106.29 --> 1110.93
my own fault because well I have a

1108.42 --> 1115.8500000000001
carpet and when you have a carpet you

1110.93 --> 1119.4
know even if it's just I don't know a

1115.85 --> 1120.36
carpet that typically brings out a lot

1119.4 --> 1124.98
of dust

1120.36 --> 1128.34
it just creates dust and of course

1124.98 --> 1132.24
people themselves also create dust it's

1128.34 --> 1136.5
like yeah it's just the skin and all

1132.24 --> 1138.929
that it just happens and the more there

1136.5 --> 1141.53
is going around in the air it's not even

1138.929 --> 1144.42
about infection you know it's just about

1141.53 --> 1146.52
this material going around and if that

1144.42 --> 1148.549
keeps up heaping up in your lungs well

1146.52 --> 1152.09
normally your lungs have just the

1148.549 --> 1154.47
regular capacity to get it out

1152.09 --> 1157.97
unfortunately though if you smoke like I

1154.47 --> 1161.549
do then you have tend to have gathered

1157.97 --> 1165.15
substances mostly tar and all that that

1161.549 --> 1168.03
kind of make it harder for the hairs

1165.15 --> 1170.88
which would practically migrate every

1168.03 --> 1173.1
all the crap out of your lungs into your

1170.88 --> 1175.0200000000002
throat and out because that's hairs it's

1173.1 --> 1177.48
incredible it works it's like a giant

1175.02 --> 1180.809
reversed caterpillar like these hairs

1177.48 --> 1182.19
just move it out and the breathing

1180.809 --> 1184.799
motion and all it's pretty sophisticated

1182.19 --> 1187.0800000000002
how that works but if you then head yeah

1184.799 --> 1190.11
or a smoker it has more trouble and if

1187.08 --> 1193.11
then you get overwhelmed by dust it can

1190.11 --> 1195.9289999999999
bring in complications just general

1193.11 --> 1198.57
health complications not necessarily

1195.929 --> 1200.39
things like cancer it's just not good

1198.57 --> 1204.84
for your condition and all that and

1200.39 --> 1207.419
that's why I really want one so please

1204.84 --> 1215.4289999999999
guys help me out in some way I don't

1207.419 --> 1218.73
know man and yeah watching what is it

1215.429 --> 1222.21
the latest kroehner update from the from

1218.73 --> 1225.9
the prisoner united states talking about

1222.21 --> 1230.3700000000001
hospitals and air filters so like even

1225.9 --> 1233.16
he gets it filtering the air it's it's a

1230.37 --> 1236.28
good industrial investment because if

1233.16 --> 1242.16
there's one good advantage of mass

1236.28 --> 1245.12
responses it stimulates mass production

1242.16 --> 1247.919
and when you have mass production setups

1245.12 --> 1250.35
then suddenly the production of these

1247.919 --> 1252.8700000000001
things become cheaper now if the

1250.35 --> 1253.4099999999999
development just keep on going and going

1252.87 --> 1254.07
and going

1253.41 --> 1256.2900000000002
if

1254.07 --> 1258.6
you put out super-heavy mass-production

1256.29 --> 1261.0
right at the start of the developments

1258.6 --> 1264.54
then you end up with giant amounts of

1261.0 --> 1266.73
devices that will yeah after a short

1264.54 --> 1270.74
while be completely outdated pretty much

1266.73 --> 1273.27
become useless but air filters have been

1270.74 --> 1274.08
designed designed and developed and

1273.27 --> 1276.21
fine-tuned

1274.08 --> 1279.59
on many different fronts for a long

1276.21 --> 1284.3400000000001
period so to now go into mass production

1279.59 --> 1290.1299999999999
of a well developed system may actually

1284.34 --> 1292.4399999999998
have some industrial benefits for

1290.13 --> 1295.74
everyone eventually because yeah it may

1292.44 --> 1298.74
be that if this now is just boosted up

1295.74 --> 1301.95
other people will find that maybe they

1298.74 --> 1304.95
yeah you can actually buy an air filter

1301.95 --> 1308.7
yourself cheaper than before who knows

1304.95 --> 1313.05
this is the concept you know it's it's

1308.7 --> 1315.39
it's possible if they don't real Road

1313.05 --> 1320.3999999999999
and choke it also that you nobody can do

1315.39 --> 1324.2900000000002
that I hope not but if they yeah this

1320.4 --> 1326.6100000000001
could come out of it and you know but

1324.29 --> 1330.47
yeah whatever is gonna happen in the

1326.61 --> 1333.78
United States and their developments and

1330.47 --> 1338.72
Hospital updates and all that I still

1333.78 --> 1338.72
neither yeah fresh air system right here

1341.37 --> 1348.57
oh really Patricia Dockery you love my

1344.55 --> 1349.68
country's accent makes you giggle goodie

1348.57 --> 1353.34
I hate it

1349.68 --> 1356.46
second standard and my terrible accent

1353.34 --> 1360.4199999999998
really only comes out when I start to

1356.46 --> 1363.18
stumble with ya with the words coming

1360.42 --> 1366.5900000000001
out and then for then the terrible

1363.18 --> 1366.5900000000001
accent slips back in

1374.33 --> 1386.4089999999999
I'm sorry bear if if you can show profit

1377.809 --> 1386.4089999999999
it'll get done what do you mean exactly

1390.45 --> 1400.3500000000001
HEPA filters ravemon mispers for years I

1393.48 --> 1402.45
use them in my furnace HEPA filters let

1400.35 --> 1413.81
me see what that is don't know the

1402.45 --> 1413.81
terminology oh right right right

1419.57 --> 1425.809
yes this is a certain type of fabric

1422.299 --> 1428.539
right it's funny because I think that

1425.809 --> 1432.019
that type of fabric is also in the back

1428.539 --> 1433.789
of the filter as part of it I had to

1432.019 --> 1438.769
clean it out many times you know it

1433.789 --> 1442.85
collects a lot of dust but I think that

1438.769 --> 1447.019
they have that type of fabric in there

1442.85 --> 1449.4789999999998
as well it's a good system and it's it's

1447.019 --> 1453.2
not just one thing there's like four

1449.479 --> 1456.049
different very good well-thought-out

1453.2 --> 1461.049
highly highly developed things that are

1456.049 --> 1461.049
all part of this filter system so

1467.19 --> 1473.49
oh thank you

1471.03 --> 1475.23
wait 60 RMC for the two Canadian

1473.49 --> 1478.35
Canadian dollar super check the nation

1475.23 --> 1482.73
have to go this hoax proof proves how

1478.35 --> 1486.33
people are asleep this hoax which hoax

1482.73 --> 1488.43
write the corona situation well how is

1486.33 --> 1491.1899999999998
sleep are they or you know there's two

1488.43 --> 1493.5900000000001
angles to it people could be like oh my

1491.19 --> 1498.93
god we have to do it oh no or Karuna

1493.59 --> 1502.02
will get us like that or people will be

1498.93 --> 1504.75
like okay this is like a government test

1502.02 --> 1507.96
this is the situation it's like a game

1504.75 --> 1509.88
and yeah there will be a lot of

1507.96 --> 1513.3
dumbasses that probably completely

1509.88 --> 1515.46
believe it but it's a game and if you

1513.3 --> 1517.59
completely resist you will get into

1515.46 --> 1519.95
trouble for your business or something

1517.59 --> 1523.04
so I think there's a lot of people that

1519.95 --> 1526.05
aren't taking it that serious but

1523.04 --> 1530.79
realize that the situation still is

1526.05 --> 1533.31
serious despite that the virus hype is a

1530.79 --> 1535.8
hype and being overblown and they'll

1533.31 --> 1541.53
still kind of go along with it but it is

1535.8 --> 1543.24
still unnerving it's it's also yeah

1541.53 --> 1546.69
again like I said yes it's not pleasant

1543.24 --> 1549.81
to realize that just everybody is going

1546.69 --> 1554.0900000000001
along with it because apparently that is

1549.81 --> 1554.09
the situation now where everybody feels

1554.48 --> 1561.42
threatened enough or forced pressured by

1559.11 --> 1566.24
the government and media to indeed

1561.42 --> 1569.64
completely go along with it and not just

1566.24 --> 1571.53
not change anything and just say no I'm

1569.64 --> 1577.19
not going along with this this is a

1571.53 --> 1577.19
farce I haven't seen anybody do that

1578.8 --> 1584.32
ah thank you Wow

1582.16 --> 1585.19
getting a lot of super Ches today thank

1606.52 --> 1615.67
much retracted again so even though it

1609.79 --> 1619.6599999999999
may be good for the income numbers on

1615.67 --> 1622.9
the stats concerning our win you know as

1619.66 --> 1626.1100000000001
a person effectively financially it's

1622.9 --> 1627.64
not giving me a lot extra yeah it's

1626.11 --> 1630.55
pretty much giving me nothing extra but

1627.64 --> 1633.49

me to just see the list of patreon sigh

1707.8 --> 1713.11
God like I can't find it

1709.36 --> 1721.27
I find this system of exploration in on

1713.11 --> 1725.59
that page kind of annoying ah yes the

1721.27 --> 1728.08
atom weakened thank you for the two-part

1725.59 --> 1731.1699999999998

1731.17 --> 1740.1000000000001
PayPal okay thanks

1745.23 --> 1748.359
[Music]

1748.799 --> 1753.229
yeah

1750.19 --> 1753.229
[Music]

1764.4 --> 1771.0400000000002
yeah you know what it was kind of odd

1768.76 --> 1774.94
yesterday I did do my newspaper rounds

1771.04 --> 1777.79
and when I was just doing it I got a lot

1774.94 --> 1782.6200000000001
of weird looking eyes toward me like

1777.79 --> 1785.9099999999999
what he's just gonna got gonna spread

1782.62 --> 1788.86
around newspapers but all the infection

1785.91 --> 1791.8300000000002
possibilities did like I could see that

1788.86 --> 1798.51
people were almost like you shouldn't be

1791.83 --> 1800.86
doing that and I'm like no I'm not gonna

1798.51 --> 1805.6
besides I wear gloves

1800.86 --> 1810.7299999999998
when I do it anyway like I am natch like

1805.6 --> 1814.9289999999999
I don't even believe in viruses but I do

1810.73 --> 1819.28
believe in just being sensibly hygienic

1814.929 --> 1823.89
and all that and I wear gloves so I am

1819.28 --> 1829.78
like per default kind of already

1823.89 --> 1832.39
somewhat virus fear friendly in a way I

1829.78 --> 1838.8999999999999
don't know to describe it I'm just I've

1832.39 --> 1839.919
always been kind of careful so they have

1838.9 --> 1841.7800000000002
nothing to worry about

1839.919 --> 1846.0700000000002
there's nothing spreading through those

1841.78 --> 1850.3899999999999
newspapers besides yeah headline Corona

1846.07 --> 1853.8999999999999
Corona so anyway I am kind of sweating

1850.39 --> 1857.3700000000001
it I guess but I'm just I'm you know I'm

1853.9 --> 1860.3700000000001
not doing it to make any money really I

1857.37 --> 1860.37
just

1861.57 --> 1866.12
it's odd you know at this corona

1863.88 --> 1870.0
situation is affecting everything

1866.12 --> 1872.9299999999998
including my weird basic life so

1870.0 --> 1877.17
normally when I do my newspaper rounds I

1872.93 --> 1879.96
bring it around very very perfection and

1877.17 --> 1882.69
do it very well and then at the end I

1879.96 --> 1890.13
have a lot of newspapers left over and I

1882.69 --> 1902.4
drop them at the it's like you call that

1890.13 --> 1905.0100000000002
in English yeah a community center right

1902.4 --> 1908.69
it's like a community center there are

1905.01 --> 1912.72
several of the mayor Utrecht and the one

1908.69 --> 1916.02
yeah that happens to be exactly in that

1912.72 --> 1919.8600000000001
neighborhood and what I do is I take

1916.02 --> 1922.2
those papers and I leave them there so

1919.86 --> 1924.99
that people can get there and get those

1922.2 --> 1926.76
newspapers because there's not a lot of

1924.99 --> 1929.43
people actually spreading them and I'm

1926.76 --> 1932.91
not talking because of her owner no

1929.43 --> 1935.3100000000002
nobody did it hasn't in like years so

1932.91 --> 1937.95
there everybody every time I get there

1935.31 --> 1941.31
in the end there's always a whole group

1937.95 --> 1944.22
of old people that come there like every

1941.31 --> 1946.53
week and have dinner like it's a

1944.22 --> 1948.33
community thing like certain people I

1946.53 --> 1952.32
guess are volunteering or something or

1948.33 --> 1957.96
and they then cook dinner and yeah it's

1952.32 --> 1960.0
like you know 15 20 older people sitting

1957.96 --> 1961.8
guys it's always very cozy and nice and

1960.0 --> 1964.52
they all know me it's like ah here is

1961.8 --> 1968.21
the guy bringing the newspaper again and

1964.52 --> 1974.91
yes since the corona they closed it down

1968.21 --> 1977.27
it's like okay so that's major bummer

1974.91 --> 1979.3200000000002
for these old people you know because

1977.27 --> 1980.76
that was kind of their weekly

1979.32 --> 1985.11
get-together

1980.76 --> 1987.3
and what are they gonna do now they're

1985.11 --> 1991.2199999999998
just gonna sit home by themselves more

1987.3 --> 1993.12
internet I don't know this just felt I

1991.22 --> 1995.88
felt kind of sad

1993.12 --> 1997.32
anyway I miss him because I like that

1995.88 --> 1999.2900000000002
they're there they're there they're

1997.32 --> 2004.1599999999999
having a lot of fun there and they're

1999.29 --> 2005.6
good talks and and I yeah they also very

2004.16 --> 2007.64
much appreciate that I bring the

2005.6 --> 2010.52
newspaper I even person-to-person hand

2007.64 --> 2012.2900000000002
one out when I get there and they start

2010.52 --> 2015.41
talking about what's going on and then

2012.29 --> 2019.22
it's like it works that's why I do it it

2015.41 --> 2021.8600000000001
works they really enjoy it and I managed

2019.22 --> 2026.2
to just do one little simple thing one

2021.86 --> 2029.8999999999999
one time a week that in its simplicity

2026.2 --> 2034.55
just seemed so effective at making

2029.9 --> 2037.19
people happy and now yeah the community

2034.55 --> 2040.94
center is closed and yet the only thing

2037.19 --> 2042.95
I can do pretty much is just drop the

2040.94 --> 2045.1100000000001
pile of leftover newspapers right in

2042.95 --> 2048.08
front of the door because probably

2045.11 --> 2050.0
people checking it out anyway to see

2048.08 --> 2052.31
because there's people coming there when

2050.0 --> 2055.34
they need help for all kinds of things

2052.31 --> 2059.0299999999997
just social things or no family issues

2055.34 --> 2062.48
whatever financial and it's like clothes

2059.03 --> 2068.27
kind of a bummer but yeah then there's

2062.48 --> 2076.349
at least a newspaper there anyway yeah

2068.27 --> 2079.409
that that happened yesterday yeah

2076.349 --> 2082.259
just goes to show that even my basic

2079.409 --> 2085.9190000000003
life activities are directly influenced

2082.259 --> 2094.47
by this Corona in Ellison's and I feel

2085.919 --> 2097.249
kind of sad for the old people what what

2094.47 --> 2097.249
are you guys talking about

2103.69 --> 2109.809
now sparkling coffee it's not really

2106.24 --> 2113.2599999999998
mainstream news it's it's like a city

2109.809 --> 2115.42
newspaper it's a newspaper that directly

2113.26 --> 2119.0200000000004
involves things that happen in the city

2115.42 --> 2121.0
and the city's response to things in the

2119.02 --> 2122.65
Netherlands or outside of wood you know

2121.0 --> 2126.7
like that it's like the the city

2122.65 --> 2129.94
newspaper it's not just super mainstream

2126.7 --> 2131.98
news nonsense but if there is some hype

2129.94 --> 2133.69
going around you you better damn well

2131.98 --> 2136.059
believe there's gonna be some kind of

2133.69 --> 2139.27
item about it in that newspaper too

2136.059 --> 2141.19
because it's all the talk so yeah

2139.27 --> 2143.41
community newspaper in a way it's well

2141.19 --> 2159.549
it is a private enterprise though sort

2143.41 --> 2160.99
of you know but there's there's it's so

2159.549 --> 2164.47
funny when you think about there's so

2160.99 --> 2166.99
many angles to like newspapers and yeah

2164.47 --> 2172.3289999999997
who really reads newspapers anymore

2166.99 --> 2174.549
anyway these days you know and is it bad

2172.329 --> 2178.079
usually newspapers are already kind of

2174.549 --> 2181.42
recycled paper anyway so it's gonna be

2178.079 --> 2184.119
yeah just less it's not like there's

2181.42 --> 2187.839
going to be nature directly trashed you

2184.119 --> 2190.15
just to maintain that and I don't know

2187.839 --> 2193.089
if you can get it all into the

2190.15 --> 2195.1600000000003
ridiculous Corona Fair then yeah it's me

2193.089 --> 2201.599
spreading around newspapers actually

2195.16 --> 2206.2
gives people free a back up toilet paper

2201.599 --> 2210.7000000000003
so yeah I really don't see anything

2206.2 --> 2213.339
wrong from any angle of me in this

2210.7 --> 2216.029
period spreading around around these

2213.339 --> 2216.029
newspapers

2220.4 --> 2229.7490000000003
oh yeah another thing about some

2227.329 --> 2232.849
newspapers right right right

2229.749 --> 2239.95
when the power goes down you can still

2232.849 --> 2239.9500000000003
read a newspaper how about that

2247.75 --> 2253.039
[Music]

2248.95 --> 2256.8799999999997
also newspaper can't be retro actively

2253.039 --> 2259.0690000000004
edited you know it can't be like oh it's

2256.88 --> 2262.039
in the newspaper and then like the

2259.069 --> 2263.48
writers figure out like wait we

2262.039 --> 2266.5890000000004
shouldn't have said that and then they

2263.48 --> 2271.43
just edit it out well unless maybe

2266.589 --> 2274.339
Mandela effect in some bizarre first you

2271.43 --> 2277.549
know nah that's not get into that just

2274.339 --> 2279.41
newspapers don't edit it's like once

2277.549 --> 2282.47
it's printed it's printed so it's like

2279.41 --> 2285.3799999999997
permanent yeah where's the new sites all

2282.47 --> 2287.7099999999996
kind of things can be done with that and

2285.38 --> 2293.589
edit didn't know that so that's another

2287.71 --> 2298.569
another kind of advantage about it for

2293.589 --> 2300.8289999999997
for people for the controllers it's yeah

2298.569 --> 2304.64
did you know is much more advantageous

2300.829 --> 2307.849
they can edit it they can much more

2304.64 --> 2311.839
easily applied doublethink changes and

2307.849 --> 2317.21
all that memory holes but yeah with

2311.839 --> 2320.2889999999998
printed stuff not so much once it's

2317.21 --> 2320.289
printed it's printed

2333.09 --> 2345.09
yeah Missouri bear yeah I've heard that

2339.51 --> 2345.09
it's weird it's still it's all weird

2352.04 --> 2360.68
I have my theories about it though you

2355.94 --> 2362.78
know let's get all conspiratorial for a

2360.68 --> 2365.93
moment and just assume that there are a

2362.78 --> 2369.26
did Mandela effects changes happening in

2365.93 --> 2376.16
the Bible where is it happening is it

2369.26 --> 2381.6200000000003
happening in the essential core to the

2376.16 --> 2384.2
story to what is transpired is it or is

2381.62 --> 2388.0699999999997
it more like side effects that are kind

2384.2 --> 2391.3399999999997
of shifting around you know because I

2388.07 --> 2393.77
think that the main story and just what

2391.34 --> 2395.57
what makes the Bible really the Bible

2393.77 --> 2403.06
what is the core essence of it I don't

2395.57 --> 2406.78
think it is changed at all you know

2403.06 --> 2412.91
considering how the Bible has been

2406.78 --> 2414.92
created who made who made it not so much

2412.91 --> 2416.48
like is the story true where it's come

2414.92 --> 2419.09
from but just who made it who's been

2416.48 --> 2422.87
handling it what has happened since all

2419.09 --> 2425.57
that time craziness and the darkness

2422.87 --> 2433.16
that people have been tapping into since

2425.57 --> 2435.8
then one could even theorize that the

2433.16 --> 2439.2799999999997
Mandela effect could may possibly only

2435.8 --> 2443.8300000000004
be able to alter the things that were

2439.28 --> 2443.8300000000004
kind of already altered like that

2445.72 --> 2453.58
see that that I don't know people that

2449.95 --> 2456.91
have been at the tables or giving the

2453.58 --> 2461.23
artists to the priests to write a new

2456.91 --> 2465.2799999999997
version that there there were certain

2461.23 --> 2468.07
alterations happening and that that is

2465.28 --> 2469.9900000000002
kind of like this in you could say it's

2468.07 --> 2475.3500000000004
been always there's just didn't really

2469.99 --> 2480.79
impact too much and that bear is the

2475.35 --> 2482.71
thing where it can switch around this

2480.79 --> 2487.39
this sounds really surreal I know it's

2482.71 --> 2489.28
just I'm kind of in science fiction mode

2487.39 --> 2492.3399999999997
about this right now but I don't think

2489.28 --> 2494.2000000000003
that the whole Bible the core has the

2492.34 --> 2496.23
essence of it I don't think it can

2494.2 --> 2496.23
change

2506.54 --> 2514.63
like yeah for example the the wine

2510.14 --> 2520.91
bottles - wine sex you know that thing

2514.63 --> 2525.26
it's like does it really matter does it

2520.91 --> 2528.35
really matter for the actual Bible story

2525.26 --> 2531.32
or even our historical significance does

2528.35 --> 2534.62
it have like a oh no my god bottles -

2531.32 --> 2538.25
too early that's dangerous because now

2534.62 --> 2541.19
the the development has altered like

2538.25 --> 2544.42
that does it does it have any impact

2541.19 --> 2544.42
whatsoever really

2564.83 --> 2572.33
God really John em that's just silly so

2570.05 --> 2580.34
they'd like literally Mandela affecting

2572.33 --> 2582.8199999999997
even basic things that's just weird but

2580.34 --> 2587.84
are you sir are you sure that's true

2582.82 --> 2590.21
that it's now but it like who's gotten

2587.84 --> 2594.1400000000003
like letters for example on paper

2590.21 --> 2595.91
remember letters from the CDC and that

2594.14 --> 2600.2599999999998
now suddenly they look in their old

2595.91 --> 2602.54
paper yeah to throw away in the look at

2600.26 --> 2607.4
the letter and it now all says centers

2602.54 --> 2610.7
does it does it do that now because that

2607.4 --> 2614.98
would be kind of freaky not really

2610.7 --> 2614.98
important though but it's still weird

2617.81 --> 2621.04
[Music]

2649.119 --> 2654.099
what Geoffrey Bill oh god people are now

2651.88 --> 2656.98
completely going into the Mandela effect

2654.099 --> 2661.4500000000003
has it aggravated is there more Mandela

2656.98 --> 2664.15
madness now I'm not gonna drown myself

2661.45 --> 2666.49
in that just just a slight warning

2664.15 --> 2668.14
because I know this [ __ ] is going on

2666.49 --> 2671.769
like I've been confronted with like

2668.14 --> 2675.339
absurdly shocking Mandela realizations

2671.769 --> 2677.41
pretty early on that were so unnerving

2675.339 --> 2679.69
to me that I literally forgot all about

2677.41 --> 2681.3689999999997
it again okay yeah that type of [ __ ]

2679.69 --> 2688.15
seems to be happening it seems to be a

2681.369 --> 2692.2000000000003
theme throughout first three-quarters of

2688.15 --> 2695.619
my life but yeah I wouldn't be surprised

2692.2 --> 2697.749
if now it's just freaking every freaking

2695.619 --> 2705.849
thing you look at it's just no it's

2697.749 --> 2708.279
slightly different again just I I'm just

2705.849 --> 2710.549
trying to not get distracted by it

2708.279 --> 2710.549
anymore

2736.15 --> 2742.299
all right well Jeffrey bill you know

2739.21 --> 2744.4900000000002
what concerning the JFK car situation

2742.299 --> 2746.799
that there's no this suppose that six

2744.49 --> 2748.839
people there I don't know what you're

2746.799 --> 2752.13
talking about but if that were the case

2748.839 --> 2754.779
then I'd like to remind you of a certain

2752.13 --> 2759.609
insight that Owen Benjamin had a while

2754.779 --> 2763.359
ago namely that well JFK might not

2759.609 --> 2767.02
simply have not been shot at all they

2763.359 --> 2772.9
may have been a puppet and we can get a

2767.02 --> 2775.0
little crazier what if that that scenery

2772.9 --> 2779.73
with the car and all that what if all of

2775.0 --> 2783.01
that that specific part was a studio a

2779.73 --> 2785.559
complete recreation studio of that

2783.01 --> 2788.4100000000003
specific place in that city where that's

2785.559 --> 2791.7400000000002
supposed to have happened and they just

2788.41 --> 2793.569
did a couple of runs of it because how

2791.74 --> 2796.1499999999996
many people in the background are over

2793.569 --> 2799.0
there like you see no in that shot not a

2796.15 --> 2801.52
lot that's specific well not a lot the

2799.0 --> 2802.93
ones before that right more people well

2801.52 --> 2804.52
that's specific shot not a lot so it

2802.93 --> 2806.5
could have been a studio thing and

2804.52 --> 2810.22
there's just multiple versions out there

2806.5 --> 2812.349
and they just decided for like for the

2810.22 --> 2814.3289999999997
hell of it okay let's throw the other

2812.349 --> 2816.549
one out there and say this is what the

2814.329 --> 2818.049
truth was now they could literally just

2816.549 --> 2823.71
be screwing around with the old

2818.049 --> 2826.72
materials now because yeah the Kennedy

2823.71 --> 2830.559
shooting itself could have simply be a

2826.72 --> 2831.9399999999996
dummy studio event that a they have done

2830.559 --> 2836.6800000000003
multiple times

2831.94 --> 2839.38
it sounds very nutty but that might have

2836.68 --> 2841.4199999999996
been a possibility that it never really

2839.38 --> 2842.859
happened and then yeah when studios are

2841.42 --> 2844.66
involved then you can have multiple

2842.859 --> 2847.02
shots you can have call kinds of

2844.66 --> 2847.02
weirdness

2858.91 --> 2871.029
ya ever realized that maybe JFK he may

2866.769 --> 2876.3999999999996
still be alive well although he was a

2871.029 --> 2878.5
pretty yeah a pretty dedicated sodomite

2876.4 --> 2880.7690000000002
so yeah how long do they live that

2878.5 --> 2884.19
lifestyle you know even the secret

2880.769 --> 2887.529
mm-hmm but technically maybe if he

2884.19 --> 2889.69
mended his ways and stepped away from

2887.529 --> 2890.079
the but funking yeah he might still be

2889.69 --> 2901.839
alive

2890.079 --> 2902.319
who knows have you ever thought about

2901.839 --> 2906.609
that

2902.319 --> 2907.0
this I bet nobody ever thought about

2906.609 --> 2910.8289999999997
that

2907.0 --> 2910.829
JFK may still be alive

2934.65 --> 2937.78
[Music]

2939.079 --> 2943.1090000000004
although I think that if he would be

2941.309 --> 2949.409
alive he would be pretty damn old right

2943.109 --> 2956.909
now so you might have just died from old

2949.409 --> 2959.4590000000003
age anyway Hitler - then - oh hey but

2956.909 --> 2961.739
yeah but with Hitler it's even more

2959.459 --> 2966.089
obvious then he definitely did not

2961.739 --> 2968.579
commit suicide there because he even

2966.089 --> 2972.2889999999998
seen pictures it's like photographs of

2968.579 --> 2974.5190000000002
him in Argentina was it much older I

2972.289 --> 2977.8190000000004
really think that he didn't die and he

2974.519 --> 2982.1989999999996
just was sneaked out through some kind

2977.819 --> 2988.859
of sub submarine to Argentina and he

2982.199 --> 2992.88
just retired there but that's just more

2988.859 --> 2994.639
blatantly obvious with JFK if he'd still

2992.88 --> 2998.88
be alive it would be pretty freakin

2994.639 --> 3000.679
bizarre don't think anybody would see

2998.88 --> 3003.7290000000003
that coming if that would happen but hey

3000.679 --> 3006.949
it could have been you know even if that

3003.729 --> 3010.749
that thing they did the fake shooting

3006.949 --> 3013.429
even if that he wasn't dead there

3010.749 --> 3014.959
doesn't mean that the real JFK would

3013.429 --> 3016.669
have even been alive you know they could

3014.959 --> 3020.269
have just made these freaking dummies of

3016.669 --> 3021.3089999999997
him killed him and then proceeded to do

3020.269 --> 3025.6589999999997
the act

3021.309 --> 3025.659
we don't know I don't know

3033.35 --> 3042.14
no badge batch it's not really funny and

3038.97 --> 3042.14
there is no gas bill

3068.82 --> 3071.54
P

3077.17 --> 3085.78
okay that's weird Karen B just went life

3081.44 --> 3085.78
that's a very unusual time

3102.31 --> 3108.58
the Clintons got to Hitler that's that

3106.33 --> 3113.16
sounds really weird man when you put it

3108.58 --> 3113.16
like that and believe all productions

3121.95 --> 3127.5
right well good yeah

3125.64 --> 3128.97
good serving the hundred years old yeah

3127.5 --> 3131.13
and then it's all the matter of like

3128.97 --> 3135.8089999999997
would you have made it and join up

3131.13 --> 3137.52
though yeah just just Lee says that he

3135.809 --> 3140.0
would probably not have lasted me on

3137.52 --> 3145.38
sixty years because he was so unhealthy

3140.0 --> 3149.28
and yeah he probably knew it he was like

3145.38 --> 3151.829
okay I'm not super healthy I know what

3149.28 --> 3156.2400000000002
pumping is probably gonna kill it but

3151.829 --> 3159.8390000000004
literally screw it I'm gonna do what I

3156.24 --> 3166.4599999999996
want and then I'll just die he could

3159.839 --> 3169.47
have been like that did you know

3166.46 --> 3172.559
technically it could be much more

3169.47 --> 3176.0989999999997
embarrassing even then then I

3172.559 --> 3178.619
conspiracies so far saying that it was

3176.099 --> 3180.1800000000003
just dummies being shot because they may

3178.619 --> 3184.1400000000003
not have actually killed him they may

3180.18 --> 3186.18
have actually just found him like dead

3184.14 --> 3190.14
in a pool of his own diarrhea and blood

3186.18 --> 3194.1189999999997
and just like he died from fatal blood

3190.14 --> 3197.3289999999997
pumping or something like that you know

3194.119 --> 3200.7000000000003
how freaking embarrassing would that be

3197.329 --> 3203.4900000000002
yeah the President of the United States

3200.7 --> 3209.7
just died from a fatal but pumping

3203.49 --> 3213.24
accident no no let's do that again let's

3209.7 --> 3214.89
just get the CIA involved and yeah

3213.24 --> 3216.8089999999997
depressant shop yeah yeah we can

3214.89 --> 3229.3799999999997
actually use that it's not as freakin

3216.809 --> 3231.4500000000003
unbelievably embarrassing hmm I might

3229.38 --> 3234.23
not be too far off actually now that I

3231.45 --> 3234.23
think about it

3240.809 --> 3243.809
yeah

3244.71 --> 3247.82
[Music]

3261.39 --> 3269.52
oh you're welcome Robin Stanley well I

3265.29 --> 3273.06
think that this concept it still it

3269.52 --> 3276.57
would be totally something that Owen

3273.06 --> 3278.46
Benjamin could bring forth because yeah

3276.57 --> 3281.34
what would be more embarrassing for the

3278.46 --> 3284.88
United States if they like went into the

3281.34 --> 3287.31
ovens like oh my god I think the

3284.88 --> 3291.21
president just died from a fatal blood

3287.31 --> 3294.11
pumping accident how do we fix this no

3291.21 --> 3294.11
one can ever know

3309.55 --> 3320.5800000000004
ile Jeffrey bill I don't want to know

3314.2 --> 3323.7999999999997
but yes general advice weightlifting and

3320.58 --> 3331.3199999999997
blood pumping is not a combination good

3323.8 --> 3331.32
combination of things to be doing yes

3336.18 --> 3339.2799999999997
[Music]

3340.14 --> 3349.3599999999997
and thankfully I don't know that from

3343.6 --> 3351.13
personal experience if it doesn't take

3349.36 --> 3352.8700000000003
too long to put the pieces together

3351.13 --> 3356.46
figure out yeah that's probably not

3352.87 --> 3356.46
going to be the best of combinations

3364.32 --> 3375.3700000000003
died weightlifting did he or did he just

3372.7 --> 3381.0099999999998
die from his arteries being all clogged

3375.37 --> 3383.5499999999997
up with all the the yeah poisonous foods

3381.01 --> 3388.09
that has been shoving down his throat

3383.55 --> 3390.2200000000003
you know yeah if you if you're full of

3388.09 --> 3394.03
toxins if you're all full of junk and

3390.22 --> 3397.5699999999997
all that or have like drug problems and

3394.03 --> 3400.6600000000003
then metabolic junk remnants going

3397.57 --> 3402.6400000000003
throughout your you know it piles up or

3400.66 --> 3404.35
if you then go out of nothing like

3402.64 --> 3408.42
really go heavy weight lifting or

3404.35 --> 3411.73
something yeah like this little shock

3408.42 --> 3414.1
your body's not like can't handle that

3411.73 --> 3418.2
much stress all of a sudden yeah that

3414.1 --> 3418.2
could be bad it could be dangerous

3419.73 --> 3425.89
it's just like if you're kind of obese

3422.92 --> 3427.66
and all that and you go sudden maniacal

3425.89 --> 3429.94
workout he just don't stop yeah you

3427.66 --> 3434.5499999999997
could get a heart attack and die if

3429.94 --> 3439.39
you're not careful you know you got it

3434.55 --> 3442.09
you can't just all attack it and get it

3439.39 --> 3442.75
out no you'll attack your heart instead

3442.09 --> 3447.88
no you didn't

3442.75 --> 3450.31
to need to build it gradually and first

3447.88 --> 3452.35
with health you know healthy eating is

3450.31 --> 3456.07
the best way to get rid of your obesity

3452.35 --> 3459.1
not working out and then once you get

3456.07 --> 3462.4900000000002
the healthy eating going then is the

3459.1 --> 3464.56
time to start working out because then

3462.49 --> 3466.33
you got everything you got like the

3464.56 --> 3469.0299999999997
building blocks back again the ones that

3466.33 --> 3473.74
you really need in order for you to be

3469.03 --> 3476.3500000000004
able to to then start working out the

3473.74 --> 3478.4799999999996
crap but if you don't have the right

3476.35 --> 3480.85
building blocks to replace them with

3478.48 --> 3494.4900000000002
yeah your your body's gonna probably die

3480.85 --> 3494.49
