weather today is

109.759 --> 114.72
yeah

111.28 --> 118.24
very similar to yesterday

114.72 --> 118.24
it had been raining again

118.64 --> 123.68
yesterday evening and all that

122.23 --> 126.24000000000001
[Music]

123.68 --> 127.36000000000001
but right now yeah it's been dry so far

126.24 --> 130.959
but

127.36 --> 133.04
still moist it cooled down quite a bit

130.959 --> 137.12
compared to yesterday

133.04 --> 137.12
last time i checked it was 18 degrees

138.879 --> 142.79999999999998
no idea what's going on up there this is

141.04 --> 145.76
like the first peak i'm even getting

142.8 --> 145.76000000000002
into the blue sky

146.48 --> 152.64
i don't know if they've been trailing or

148.0 --> 152.64
not because it's been mostly just a big

153.28 --> 159.2
cloud covered

154.72 --> 159.2
sky with no blue sky in between there

167.04 --> 173.529
right but yeah it is definitely moist

170.3 --> 173.52900000000002
[Music]

177.3 --> 182.56
[Music]

179.76 --> 185.72
hello mike sudonic first in chat good to

182.56 --> 185.72
see you

187.12 --> 189.59900000000002
it is

190.159 --> 195.79999999999998
sunday the 26th of june 2022

199.15 --> 206.31900000000002
[Music]

204.64 --> 209.27999999999997
oh

206.319 --> 211.2
it's now 21 degrees that went up pretty

209.28 --> 213.84
quickly

211.2 --> 213.83999999999997
huh

214.48 --> 219.28
only 61 humidity that's a surprise

225.36 --> 230.56
maybe it's

226.56 --> 230.56
getting rapidly reabsorbed right now

230.879 --> 234.79899999999998
it was really moist in the morning

232.56 --> 234.799
though

238.72 --> 242.799
so yeah

241.36 --> 245.43900000000002
yesterday show

242.799 --> 248.15900000000002
i thought was pretty good i mean it

245.439 --> 249.92
started up a bit slow and yeah lots of

248.159 --> 252.239
mushroom talks

249.92 --> 254.39999999999998
talk

252.239 --> 256.88
but overall i was quite

254.4 --> 260.079
interesting

256.88 --> 261.12
and then i noticed like

260.079 --> 262.96
okay

261.12 --> 266.32
my show only

262.96 --> 266.32
got one upvote

267.68 --> 270.32
that's weird

272.08 --> 275.12
it's very odd

275.36 --> 278.16
why is that

277.199 --> 280.40000000000003
i mean

278.16 --> 283.84000000000003
the chat was all buzzing there's quite a

280.4 --> 283.84
few people there

286.4 --> 290.96
so i was wondering

288.32 --> 290.96
why is that

293.52 --> 297.75899999999996
is youtube trying to mess with my

295.28 --> 301.59999999999997
numbers again

297.759 --> 301.6
i mean was the show that good

302.08 --> 307.12
i mean the derpcon chart was it's

304.639 --> 308.96000000000004
probably received much better than i

307.12 --> 311.919
even expected

308.96 --> 314.0
it is a pretty cool thing

311.919 --> 315.919
and there's room for a lot more of that

314.0 --> 319.12
sort of thing

315.919 --> 322.32
it almost kind of kindle

319.12 --> 325.36
my the same instincts that i utilized to

322.32 --> 329.36
make my dnd book it's just like oh yeah

325.36 --> 331.84000000000003
that's actually really easy for me to do

329.36 --> 334.24
but i gotta be like the energy has got

331.84 --> 335.11999999999995
to be there

334.24 --> 337.12
right

335.12 --> 340.8
so with the dnd book when i was writing

337.12 --> 341.919
i had a lot of like much stronger even

340.8 --> 344.24
energy

341.919 --> 348.24
to do that and it lasted extremely long

344.24 --> 350.8
it was a very serious project for me

348.24 --> 353.919
and then yeah it's like

350.8 --> 355.36
i would simply use it as escapism

353.919 --> 358.15999999999997
it's like oh i don't want to deal with

355.36 --> 359.68
the situation okay i'm just gonna

358.16 --> 362.40000000000003
design stuff

359.68 --> 362.40000000000003
for my book

363.28 --> 368.15999999999997
but yeah this chart it is interesting a

365.68 --> 370.88
derpcon chart

368.16 --> 373.93
and it can be

370.88 --> 376.88
i was yeah looking through it again

373.93 --> 378.639
[Music]

376.88 --> 380.479
let me show you

378.639 --> 382.56
right at the start

380.479 --> 385.22999999999996
i think i need to

382.56 --> 386.88
if i'm gonna have

385.23 --> 391.199
[Music]

386.88 --> 393.44
actual items to insert on my show

391.199 --> 396.96000000000004
i think i will need to do them as

393.44 --> 396.96
quickly as possible

397.52 --> 402.15999999999997
and not wait until half the show's

400.08 --> 404.4
already passed

402.16 --> 406.08000000000004
it's

404.4 --> 408.23999999999995
that thing yeah that's the thing that

406.08 --> 410.56
really did stand out when i was watching

408.24 --> 413.52
yesterday's show

410.56 --> 413.52
that was a mistake

415.52 --> 419.75899999999996
so i'm

416.4 --> 422.71999999999997
just showing it again right away

419.759 --> 426.24
the first seven minutes

422.72 --> 426.24
a clutch godzilla

430.479 --> 434.0
okay you said you up voted

435.84 --> 439.599
nope it still says only one

440.08 --> 444.599
really i'll show it to you

452.24 --> 455.039
uh hold on

461.28 --> 465.67999999999995
right

462.88 --> 468.24
see that

465.68 --> 468.24
just one

468.72 --> 473.52000000000004
hold on i need to separate this it's

470.8 --> 473.52000000000004
just gonna get

474.8 --> 477.8
messy

492.0 --> 494.24
what

500.639 --> 504.17900000000003
no

501.05 --> 504.17900000000003
[Music]

504.319 --> 507.84000000000003
what is this

509.28 --> 511.52
ah

511.84 --> 515.12
right

512.88 --> 515.12
so

516.159 --> 520.599
now i'll get to chat

523.76 --> 526.64
uc3

525.12 --> 529.519
anybody else

526.64 --> 534.12
okay let me just refresh right see

529.519 --> 534.12
refresh reload current page

535.6 --> 537.839
ah

543.76 --> 548.72
right so yeah if you want to

546.08 --> 550.88
i don't know man make a point of this

548.72 --> 552.5600000000001
i left a comment

550.88 --> 554.56
here

552.56 --> 556.56
you can respond to that

554.56 --> 558.2399999999999
give maybe a little testimony or say

556.56 --> 561.399
like that doesn't make sense that would

558.24 --> 561.399
be great

566.959 --> 570.56
it's been a while by the way since this

568.959 --> 573.279
has happened

570.56 --> 574.8389999999999
it used to happen like every single show

573.279 --> 577.76
i

574.839 --> 580.24
did and then it kind of like stopped

577.76 --> 580.24
doing that

580.959 --> 583.279
weird

585.04 --> 591.56
you still see three after a refresh

587.92 --> 591.56
okay well

593.36 --> 596.48
still one over here

602.56 --> 607.92
anyway this is not a

605.68 --> 607.92
like

608.399 --> 614.959
the ultimate subject but i did wanted to

611.839 --> 618.6800000000001
yeah get your attention about that

614.959 --> 618.68
or on to that

625.04 --> 628.8
so by all means go to that

627.36 --> 631.12
to my youtube

628.8 --> 632.399
show from yesterday and to the comment

631.12 --> 634.64
section

632.399 --> 636.56
and yeah say something about that in

634.64 --> 638.0
response to my message that that would

636.56 --> 641.3599999999999
be nice

638.0 --> 642.64
so so just so that youtube knows

641.36 --> 644.48
like hey

642.64 --> 648.959
this makes no sense

644.48 --> 648.9590000000001
everybody's figuring out it's no point

651.519 --> 655.279
anyway thanks for participating with

654.0 --> 658.279
that

655.279 --> 658.279
uh

661.12 --> 664.88
i thought yesterday was a great show

665.839 --> 670.32
so i almost feel like it might have been

667.76 --> 673.56
a little bit too great

670.32 --> 673.5600000000001
in a way

675.92 --> 682.079
especially

677.92 --> 682.079
when i had that weird little moment

685.76 --> 691.68
when i brought up

689.12 --> 691.68
hold on

699.04 --> 703.8389999999999
i wish it was quicker at this but it's

701.6 --> 703.839
early

711.36 --> 715.12
yeah when i brought up

715.36 --> 718.8000000000001
the whole prejudice word

718.959 --> 725.1999999999999
everybody's like oh no no our way no no

722.24 --> 729.04
you that's not prejudice

725.2 --> 731.279
and i was just like really fascinated

729.04 --> 733.4399999999999
after having basically bumped into it

731.279 --> 735.04
again in my show and then looking it up

733.44 --> 737.6
which i didn't do

735.04 --> 739.8389999999999
during the show i just rolled in

737.6 --> 742.48
straight on intuition

739.839 --> 742.48
and it is

742.72 --> 747.36
very odd this word is very strange

748.399 --> 755.92
because it has a very split meaning

752.0 --> 759.6
that is like completely different

755.92 --> 762.399
did anybody even know that

759.6 --> 764.32
right so one part it is a preconceived

762.399 --> 766.48
opinion

764.32 --> 767.7600000000001
that is not based on reason or actual

766.48 --> 768.9590000000001
experience or

767.76 --> 771.12
you could say

768.959 --> 774.16
on empiricism

771.12 --> 776.399
or structural logic right it is a

774.16 --> 780.24
preconceived opinion

776.399 --> 781.76
that could definitely be based on

780.24 --> 783.2
morality

781.76 --> 785.519
or

783.2 --> 787.0400000000001
intuition like something feels really

785.519 --> 788.0
wrong about this

787.04 --> 790.639
or

788.0 --> 792.72
their attitude right because yeah if

790.639 --> 795.2
you're like an expert you can analyze

792.72 --> 798.5600000000001
that intuition like i would and be like

795.2 --> 800.9590000000001
yeah that's like the gamma frequency

798.56 --> 803.5189999999999
this trait that trade he's talking like

800.959 --> 805.04
this like all kinds of things i could

803.519 --> 806.5600000000001
point out right and then it's

805.04 --> 808.959
technically not

806.56 --> 811.279
prejudice i guess because there is then

808.959 --> 813.279
a structural logic to it

811.279 --> 815.12
but without that

813.279 --> 817.04
it's still something that a lot of

815.12 --> 819.519
people just follow

817.04 --> 821.199
so prejudice

819.519 --> 824.639
can be a good thing

821.199 --> 827.3599999999999
just like i intuitively called

824.639 --> 830.16
and by the way that intuition could be

827.36 --> 831.76
considered a prejudice

830.16 --> 834.3199999999999
yeah

831.76 --> 837.199
yeah actually that that is really what

834.32 --> 840.1600000000001
i'm saying but here's the other thing

837.199 --> 840.16
in the law

840.24 --> 845.12
it actually means

842.88 --> 848.079
harm or injury

845.12 --> 850.8
resulting from an action or judgment

848.079 --> 852.16
which is yeah that's not a good thing i

850.8 --> 855.279
totally get it

852.16 --> 857.36
but it's different is this

855.279 --> 858.8
look how different these were this word

857.36 --> 861.519
is

858.8 --> 864.079
and it is split like that everywhere

861.519 --> 867.12
so one is just harming

864.079 --> 869.68
and the other is like a bias

867.12 --> 873.36
based well what could be

869.68 --> 874.959
intuition on the intuition or

873.36 --> 877.6800000000001
something that hasn't been fully

874.959 --> 880.7199999999999
reasoned out

877.68 --> 884.079
which yeah that is just

880.72 --> 887.1990000000001
it blew my mind

884.079 --> 892.079
that i called this on pure intuition so

887.199 --> 892.079
that basically because of my prejudice

892.639 --> 900.16
i was able to

895.199 --> 904.639
realize that prejudice is not a bad word

900.16 --> 907.199
but yeah then within the frame of law

904.639 --> 910.24
so let's say if a judge would use the

907.199 --> 912.8
word prejudice within a judgment

910.24 --> 914.8
that's a problem that's not a prejudice

912.8 --> 919.4799999999999
you want to have

914.8 --> 919.4799999999999
isn't that just kind of mind-blowing

927.36 --> 931.759
right so it is a very confusing word by

930.24 --> 934.0790000000001
nature

931.759 --> 936.0790000000001
like on the colloquial level a lot of

934.079 --> 939.68
people are probably going to stick to

936.079 --> 941.199
that oh but causing harm yeah that

939.68 --> 943.04
you know

941.199 --> 943.8389999999999
i'm not prejudiced

943.04 --> 946.16
well

943.839 --> 947.6800000000001
legally you're not prejudice or you

946.16 --> 949.36
don't want to be

947.68 --> 952.56
but

949.36 --> 955.36
non-legally with outside of the law

952.56 --> 959.5189999999999
prejudice

955.36 --> 962.639
seems like to be very intuitively driven

959.519 --> 966.32
and like being careful

962.639 --> 967.44
even if you don't understand everything

966.32 --> 968.9590000000001
it's

967.44 --> 973.2790000000001
see

968.959 --> 975.92
this is an arwenian moment here

973.279 --> 978.16
and i i have this everywhere it's like

975.92 --> 981.199
all the words

978.16 --> 982.639
that society has been promoting for us

981.199 --> 984.079
to feel

982.639 --> 988.0
should be bad

984.079 --> 988.0
are like all good things

989.199 --> 994.639
it's just so difficult to kind of flip

991.839 --> 996.48
that around so i'm like i'm pulling a

994.639 --> 1000.0
reversed world

996.48 --> 1000.0
on the reversed worlders

1001.92 --> 1006.0
i've been doing it for quite a long time

1007.44 --> 1011.839
and there is something to this

1015.6 --> 1020.32
i mean

1017.44 --> 1022.639
like besides a couple of basic chat

1020.32 --> 1025.76
trolls or whatever does it look like i

1022.639 --> 1026.799
am in danger

1025.76 --> 1029.439
right

1026.799 --> 1031.52
because of the way that i've acted and

1029.439 --> 1033.039
my code of conduct and the principles

1031.52 --> 1035.52
that have upheld

1033.039 --> 1038.48
my interactions does it look like oh my

1035.52 --> 1040.48
god this guy is in so much trouble

1038.48 --> 1041.6
this arwyn guy

1040.48 --> 1044.799
no

1041.6 --> 1046.1599999999999
no it's not i mean yeah financially i'm

1044.799 --> 1048.0
kind of poor

1046.16 --> 1050.3200000000002
but other than that

1048.0 --> 1052.16
i've well my physical struggles but i

1050.32 --> 1054.32
would have always had that a lot of

1052.16 --> 1056.4
people have that

1054.32 --> 1058.559
learning to deal with that is part of

1056.4 --> 1060.3200000000002
life

1058.559 --> 1062.799
but i'm not like

1060.32 --> 1065.28
in trouble i'm not being sued from all

1062.799 --> 1069.12
sides it's i'm not even being like

1065.28 --> 1069.12
banned from youtube effectively

1070.08 --> 1073.76
so was i right

1077.919 --> 1081.3200000000002
am i right

1084.799 --> 1088.32
is

1086.0 --> 1090.08
pulling a reversed world

1088.32 --> 1092.08
on this

1090.08 --> 1094.8799999999999
reversed world

1092.08 --> 1098.0
the answer

1094.88 --> 1098.0
are they powerless

1098.559 --> 1101.52
in the face of it

1102.72 --> 1108.88
is all what we really have to do is

1106.48 --> 1110.559
not just say oh but that's bad what you

1108.88 --> 1112.64
want us to do is bad we're not going to

1110.559 --> 1116.0
do it it's just like i'm going to do

1112.64 --> 1117.919
exactly the opposite right now

1116.0 --> 1118.88
is that something they simply can't

1117.919 --> 1120.16
handle

1118.88 --> 1120.8400000000001
is that

1120.16 --> 1124.3200000000002
the

1120.84 --> 1124.32
secret trick

1127.039 --> 1132.799
look at the aftermath every time

1130.32 --> 1135.039
and cross-reference this concept of what

1132.799 --> 1137.76
i'm rolling out with everything

1135.039 --> 1140.16
and everybody's path and how they've

1137.76 --> 1140.16
done it

1140.72 --> 1145.1200000000001
cross-reference this concept

1142.96 --> 1148.08
is revolt is

1145.12 --> 1149.36
applying a reversed world

1148.08 --> 1152.799
approach

1149.36 --> 1154.7199999999998
to this reversed world

1152.799 --> 1157.6
world

1154.72 --> 1157.6000000000001
is that the trick

1157.76 --> 1164.16
right not to be your own balanced thing

1161.2 --> 1167.919
but to just actually be exactly the

1164.16 --> 1167.919
opposite of what they want

1175.6 --> 1180.24
because i'm almost approaching this

1177.84 --> 1182.3999999999999
religious here

1180.24 --> 1187.6
because i see it as like the reversed

1182.4 --> 1187.6000000000001
world through communism and this machine

1188.72 --> 1194.559
that is just barely human it's so

1190.72 --> 1196.16
reversed world it is playing us it has

1194.559 --> 1199.6
been playing us

1196.16 --> 1202.799
since way before i was born

1199.6 --> 1206.559
and all these these habits over

1202.799 --> 1209.44
generations just slowly leak in that

1206.559 --> 1211.44
like make us feel

1209.44 --> 1212.4
like the misleadings that we've been

1211.44 --> 1216.4
given

1212.4 --> 1217.3600000000001
are our misleadings it's of our age

1216.4 --> 1220.5590000000002
right

1217.36 --> 1223.6789999999999
and we hold on to that i'm kind of like

1220.559 --> 1226.6399999999999
scrubbing it all and and like being like

1223.679 --> 1228.48
hardcore way back

1226.64 --> 1231.3600000000001
right

1228.48 --> 1231.3600000000001
and just thinking

1233.44 --> 1237.8400000000001
what if just everything that most people

1236.08 --> 1239.76
now believe because of their programming

1237.84 --> 1242.08
is wrong because they've been fed by the

1239.76 --> 1244.799
reversed world in the first place

1242.08 --> 1246.96
so that only doing exactly the opposite

1244.799 --> 1250.1589999999999
of what it's telling you but not just in

1246.96 --> 1252.4
the moment but over all the periods

1250.159 --> 1254.5590000000002
or for all the generations

1252.4 --> 1257.1200000000001
and be exactly the opposite of what

1254.559 --> 1257.12
they're saying

1259.84 --> 1264.799
doing exactly what they tell you not to

1262.559 --> 1264.799
be

1270.08 --> 1274.08
yeah and

1271.6 --> 1276.0
the longer time passes the more people

1274.08 --> 1277.9189999999999
are just going to be deeper and deeper

1276.0 --> 1281.919
submerged in that reversed world

1277.919 --> 1285.2800000000002
programming that clouds their judgment

1281.919 --> 1288.88
makes them all think contemporarily

1285.28 --> 1288.8799999999999
instead of in the wider picture

1289.44 --> 1296.799
so this is like a new

1292.88 --> 1298.64
potential heavy tactic have the

1296.799 --> 1300.4
spirit mechanical

1298.64 --> 1303.2
warfare tactic

1300.4 --> 1305.2800000000002
i've been building it

1303.2 --> 1307.2
i've been building it for quite a while

1305.28 --> 1309.039
and i've been testing it

1307.2 --> 1310.0800000000002
and i'm very curious to see what's going

1309.039 --> 1312.1589999999999
to happen

1310.08 --> 1315.3999999999999
after now that i've just put it down

1312.159 --> 1315.4
like this

1321.36 --> 1323.28
right

1322.559 --> 1327.2
but

1323.28 --> 1330.32
because we know they have reversed world

1327.2 --> 1333.72
things and tactics right through marxism

1330.32 --> 1333.72
and other things

1334.0 --> 1340.0
and they that is like satan it is like

1337.039 --> 1342.799
the spirit of satan itself is such pure

1340.0 --> 1344.88
lies and it's only there to clouds

1342.799 --> 1345.84
everybody's judgment and to

1344.88 --> 1351.0390000000002
leech

1345.84 --> 1351.039
their poison off lies over everything

1351.6 --> 1354.6399999999999
over the generations even onto the

1353.36 --> 1356.4799999999998
future

1354.64 --> 1358.4
future people might bump

1356.48 --> 1361.6
you younger generation bump into it not

1358.4 --> 1362.4
understand it and get entranced

1361.6 --> 1365.039
so

1362.4 --> 1368.3200000000002
it's leeching into everything through

1365.039 --> 1371.76
literature and through media

1368.32 --> 1371.76
it has been for quite a while

1372.559 --> 1375.44
and

1373.44 --> 1377.28
people forget that if you get

1375.44 --> 1379.6000000000001
contaminated with the reversed world you

1377.28 --> 1382.24
get stuck in the reversed world you

1379.6 --> 1383.52
start to think reversed

1382.24 --> 1387.679
so i am

1383.52 --> 1391.52
flipping it around i'm i'm pulling their

1387.679 --> 1391.52
trick on the entire thing

1404.72 --> 1411.0
i don't know maybe you could call it

1406.48 --> 1411.0
like archaic conservatism

1413.28 --> 1419.12
i'm basically denying that any of these

1415.919 --> 1422.88
supposed developments actually are

1419.12 --> 1426.8799999999999
for the better they're all like

1422.88 --> 1428.72
temporary deals with the devil

1426.88 --> 1433.3600000000001
that just

1428.72 --> 1433.3600000000001
make people happy enough not to really

1435.279 --> 1439.36
yeah reject

1436.799 --> 1439.36
the change

1443.039 --> 1447.12
and that compounds

1445.679 --> 1449.3600000000001
because

1447.12 --> 1452.799
like a generation that can be sinning

1449.36 --> 1454.32
will be defending that sin even to their

1452.799 --> 1457.279
own families

1454.32 --> 1457.279
to their offspring

1457.679 --> 1461.2
right

1458.4 --> 1464.159
and then that story also becomes their

1461.2 --> 1466.32
offsprings in a way and so

1464.159 --> 1469.44
everybody's story is built upon other

1466.32 --> 1470.6399999999999
people's story and most people

1469.44 --> 1473.919
have

1470.64 --> 1476.72
built upon some story somewhere that is

1473.919 --> 1479.679
a reversed world lie

1476.72 --> 1480.88
and that it has shaped the cultural

1479.679 --> 1484.88
roots

1480.88 --> 1488.3200000000002
of like pop of like public thinking

1484.88 --> 1491.8400000000001
it's all reversed world

1488.32 --> 1491.84
and they don't even realize it

1497.279 --> 1500.279
ah

1502.88 --> 1505.1200000000001
right

1505.36 --> 1510.1589999999999
and it's like even for example the world

1508.32 --> 1511.6789999999999
racism i'm not the first one to bring

1510.159 --> 1514.0800000000002
this up by the way

1511.679 --> 1516.48
i think i got this from owen benjamin

1514.08 --> 1518.24
the word racism

1516.48 --> 1520.48
was

1518.24 --> 1523.039
like

1520.48 --> 1526.08
like this is

1523.039 --> 1529.919
like an etymological piece of reasoning

1526.08 --> 1531.6789999999999
the word racism is good

1529.919 --> 1534.64
you know why

1531.679 --> 1536.4
yeah it's invented but it's good

1534.64 --> 1537.5200000000002
you know why it's good

1536.4 --> 1538.799
because

1537.52 --> 1541.12
it's the thing

1538.799 --> 1543.84
that native americans

1541.12 --> 1546.2399999999998
who wanted to defend their way of life

1543.84 --> 1549.039
and their culture and and principles

1546.24 --> 1551.679
were marked with and shamed over

1549.039 --> 1551.679
brutally

1551.76 --> 1558.64
yeah that sounds like a damn good thing

1556.159 --> 1561.7600000000002
not not the persecution but what they

1558.64 --> 1566.7990000000002
were actually doing to get that

1561.76 --> 1566.799
so that means that racism is good

1567.279 --> 1571.84
etymologically

1569.44 --> 1571.8400000000001
see

1576.0 --> 1579.44
and

1576.72 --> 1582.72
dude i could probably even like rebuild

1579.44 --> 1584.3200000000002
a case for like white supremacist

1582.72 --> 1587.3600000000001
but that would be a little bit more

1584.32 --> 1589.039
complicated it's not so easily

1587.36 --> 1591.6789999999999
like picked up

1589.039 --> 1593.12
although yeah if you did a bit of longer

1591.679 --> 1594.0
research

1593.12 --> 1597.039
yeah

1594.0 --> 1600.559
you could probably do the same thing

1597.039 --> 1602.8799999999999
but do you realize like every typical

1600.559 --> 1605.44
accusation that's now thrown out of the

1602.88 --> 1607.0390000000002
marxist left this machine

1605.44 --> 1609.2
those are all

1607.039 --> 1610.799
like honor titles

1609.2 --> 1613.279
that are

1610.799 --> 1614.799
that are being thrown out like they are

1613.279 --> 1617.6
offensive

1614.799 --> 1620.72
like even the word offensive

1617.6 --> 1620.7199999999998
is actually good

1620.96 --> 1627.679
right what you want to be defensive

1625.36 --> 1632.08
i mean how many

1627.679 --> 1633.3600000000001
defensive strategies lead to victory

1632.08 --> 1635.279
not a lot of them

1633.36 --> 1636.8799999999999
i mean

1635.279 --> 1638.48
yeah if you're just on the defense

1636.88 --> 1642.3200000000002
you're never gonna overcome your

1638.48 --> 1645.2
opponent you see so offensive is

1642.32 --> 1647.4399999999998
actually a good thing

1645.2 --> 1652.039
so you got another one

1647.44 --> 1652.039
see how crazy this actually works

1662.0 --> 1667.6
no they cause racism

1664.24 --> 1671.279
no what they do is

1667.6 --> 1672.799
they create cultural degeneration

1671.279 --> 1675.2
which is not

1672.799 --> 1676.8799999999999
racism

1675.2 --> 1679.44
like racism

1676.88 --> 1682.7990000000002
isn't even racism

1679.44 --> 1686.559
again original racism is like hey why

1682.799 --> 1688.72
are you not adapting to our rules

1686.559 --> 1691.84
because i want to live my own way like

1688.72 --> 1693.919
my ancestors that's you you're racist

1691.84 --> 1695.279
that's that's what the word that's where

1693.919 --> 1697.039
it comes from

1695.279 --> 1700.24
okay it's true

1697.039 --> 1700.24
this is historical

1700.72 --> 1706.3990000000001
you're a racist if you dare

1703.44 --> 1709.279
not adapt to our ways and want to hold

1706.399 --> 1711.84
on to your way of living based on your

1709.279 --> 1711.84
ancestors

1712.0 --> 1716.0
you're a racist

1713.36 --> 1716.0
if you do that

1722.24 --> 1730.159
okay so this modern idea of racism

1726.08 --> 1730.1589999999999
it makes absolutely no sense

1730.48 --> 1735.44
and it's like split up because like okay

1735.76 --> 1741.679
some people get hysterical if you like

1739.679 --> 1744.24
talk say like oh

1741.679 --> 1746.3200000000002
oh black people or monkeys or something

1744.24 --> 1748.559
ridiculous like that i don't think that

1746.32 --> 1750.48
myself absolutely not

1748.559 --> 1753.6789999999999
although sometimes they might resemble

1750.48 --> 1756.32
it when they get going in

1753.679 --> 1758.48
in a horde or whatever

1756.32 --> 1759.76
there is footage but

1758.48 --> 1763.2
yeah

1759.76 --> 1765.6
then they go all mad over that

1763.2 --> 1768.799
how is but then another

1765.6 --> 1772.32
group can be like really [ __ ] on or

1768.799 --> 1774.799
even like physically assaulted and just

1772.32 --> 1777.9189999999999
pissed on maybe literally

1774.799 --> 1780.1589999999999
and then it's like oh yeah

1777.919 --> 1781.6000000000001
yeah you can maybe call it racist but

1780.159 --> 1785.0390000000002
whatever

1781.6 --> 1785.039
see makes no sense

1785.2 --> 1791.76
the entire word racism makes no sense it

1788.88 --> 1791.7600000000002
it has no

1791.84 --> 1796.399
roots

1793.44 --> 1798.64
in physical reality it's it's a mind

1796.399 --> 1802.7199999999998
control trick it was always a spell it

1798.64 --> 1804.7990000000002
was always a lie from the start

1802.72 --> 1808.08
like it's a

1804.799 --> 1810.6399999999999
lie based spell

1808.08 --> 1812.399
it is reversed world by nature right it

1810.64 --> 1815.44
was invented

1812.399 --> 1816.4799999999998
to shame people into abandoning their

1815.44 --> 1818.96
own

1816.48 --> 1818.96
culture

1820.159 --> 1823.8400000000001
that they had through their ancestors

1836.48 --> 1841.84
classic homeopath hello by the way hello

1839.279 --> 1843.44
guys lots of guys here

1841.84 --> 1846.799
what do you think about anti-semitism

1843.44 --> 1849.1200000000001
well anti-semitism is so convoluted

1846.799 --> 1851.44
it like it makes no sense right if you

1849.12 --> 1852.8799999999999
trace the root of the word like it has

1851.44 --> 1854.0
nothing to do

1852.88 --> 1856.96
with these

1854.0 --> 1860.08
group of people that claim

1856.96 --> 1860.08
it's all about them

1860.399 --> 1864.9599999999998
yeah

1861.84 --> 1867.519
i mean what is a semite it's pretty much

1864.96 --> 1869.039
an arab

1867.519 --> 1873.2
so then

1869.039 --> 1876.399
get into the roots of that word

1873.2 --> 1879.2
like what is anti-semitism who when was

1876.399 --> 1880.399
it like first used in that particular

1879.2 --> 1882.32
way

1880.399 --> 1884.32
because if you just look at the word you

1882.32 --> 1889.12
might think okay

1884.32 --> 1890.8799999999999
we don't like arabs right well

1889.12 --> 1893.12
historically

1890.88 --> 1896.5590000000002
that yeah that could have been a thing

1893.12 --> 1899.9189999999999
right because yeah europeans

1896.559 --> 1902.559
and arabs have had bumped into bumps

1899.919 --> 1902.5590000000002
into and

1902.96 --> 1908.72
was kind of bloody sometimes and then to

1905.6 --> 1911.12
say like yeah we freaking don't

1908.72 --> 1912.0
know arabs here right you know or in our

1911.12 --> 1914.4799999999998
bar

1912.0 --> 1916.96
whatever when you're like

1914.48 --> 1918.72
somewhere in what is it italy or greece

1916.96 --> 1920.559
or turkey i don't know

1918.72 --> 1922.32
nah not probably not terry but like

1920.559 --> 1923.84
somewhere

1922.32 --> 1924.8799999999999
halfway europe

1923.84 --> 1927.6789999999999
like

1924.88 --> 1928.7990000000002
we're anti-semitic we don't allow arabs

1927.679 --> 1931.76
in our bar

1928.799 --> 1932.72
get down back to your damn desert

1931.76 --> 1934.48
right

1932.72 --> 1936.88
that will be like yeah that's reasonable

1934.48 --> 1940.08
you had like wars and like

1936.88 --> 1941.7600000000002
torture probably horrific situations

1940.08 --> 1944.08
and

1941.76 --> 1946.72
yeah but what the hell does it have to

1944.08 --> 1946.72
do with what

1947.039 --> 1954.72
with supposed alleged jews like

1952.32 --> 1954.72
really

1958.64 --> 1962.5590000000002
like

1960.159 --> 1966.24
i mean

1962.559 --> 1969.6
if you go into like israelis and

1966.24 --> 1972.0
the tribes of judaism or whatever this

1969.6 --> 1974.399
would be the jews there right

1972.0 --> 1975.44
i mean it's not like

1974.399 --> 1979.6789999999999
they're

1975.44 --> 1982.24
a majority i mean anti-sem sam knight

1979.679 --> 1984.48
like it is an arab like they're just a

1982.24 --> 1987.919
little group of people there and it's

1984.48 --> 1989.6
like a lot of arabs

1987.919 --> 1993.3600000000001
so

1989.6 --> 1996.9599999999998
i i just don't even understand like how

1993.36 --> 2002.279
how that was bridged into becoming

1996.96 --> 2002.279
anti-jew i don't understand it

2009.039 --> 2015.12
semitic religion

2012.399 --> 2018.12
arab religions judaism christianity

2015.12 --> 2018.12
islam

2018.48 --> 2020.72
what

2026.08 --> 2029.36
i'm sorry but i don't

2031.679 --> 2034.64
i'm yeah even sure

2035.84 --> 2040.48
oh abrahamic

2038.32 --> 2043.48
i didn't misread it

2040.48 --> 2043.48
uh

2047.2 --> 2050.159
that's interesting

2050.399 --> 2055.359
well somatic if that means abrahamic

2053.119 --> 2055.359
then

2057.599 --> 2063.119
that it's like everything like

2059.919 --> 2065.7599999999998
anti-semitic that like dude that by that

2063.119 --> 2067.2000000000003
definition if you are

2065.76 --> 2070.2400000000002
yeah against

2067.2 --> 2072.48
an islamic person or a christian then

2070.24 --> 2077.3199999999997
you're also anti-semitic like

2072.48 --> 2077.32
it just doesn't make any sense man

2090.639 --> 2095.28
right but i didn't even want to like oh

2092.8 --> 2097.44
and there is no let's talk about that no

2095.28 --> 2101.2000000000003
it's just i'm talking about the words

2097.44 --> 2101.2000000000003
right the words that are used

2101.28 --> 2107.599
the words that are like the the bad

2104.079 --> 2110.1600000000003
words well the bad words that are being

2107.599 --> 2111.92
used make no freaking sense in our whole

2110.16 --> 2114.48
reversed world

2111.92 --> 2114.48
they're all

2114.839 --> 2119.2
fundamentally flipped inside out

2119.92 --> 2123.76
link to this what are you talking about

2126.48 --> 2129.48
okay

2138.4 --> 2143.0
oh did that just came out

2147.76 --> 2152.92
i'll save it to after my show

2161.68 --> 2167.44
spells designed by the beast we need our

2163.92 --> 2168.88
own memes well no yeah yes and no

2167.44 --> 2171.52
gortilla

2168.88 --> 2174.32
look my

2171.52 --> 2176.079
principle and my striving has been for a

2174.32 --> 2177.76
long time

2176.079 --> 2179.3590000000004
to take away

2177.76 --> 2182.2400000000002
the power

2179.359 --> 2182.24
from evil

2182.88 --> 2189.359
right and not destroy the tools they're

2186.24 --> 2190.3199999999997
using because they are all corrupted by

2189.359 --> 2192.48
evil

2190.32 --> 2194.7200000000003
and usually mask

2192.48 --> 2195.839
a greater power

2194.72 --> 2198.3999999999996
that is

2195.839 --> 2200.64
like potentially godly

2198.4 --> 2204.96
or at least natural

2200.64 --> 2207.2799999999997
that they have corrupted and imprisoned

2204.96 --> 2207.28
right

2207.359 --> 2212.0
a lot of symbols

2209.119 --> 2214.32
have been like captured by evil that are

2212.0 --> 2217.76
good symbols and they will always be

2214.32 --> 2220.96
good symbols but because of the mark

2217.76 --> 2223.0400000000004
of history or an event

2220.96 --> 2225.44
they've been propped up as symbols of

2223.04 --> 2229.599
evil this is evil now because this

2225.44 --> 2232.079
person in history used that symbol

2229.599 --> 2233.44
right so i'm like i'm not afraid of the

2232.079 --> 2237.52
pentagram

2233.44 --> 2238.7200000000003
pentagram is not evil it's become

2237.52 --> 2240.96
like

2238.72 --> 2243.68
it's made into evil

2240.96 --> 2245.68
it isn't evil

2243.68 --> 2249.1189999999997
hey seeking star war yeah

2245.68 --> 2249.1189999999997
like a derp gone too okay

2255.52 --> 2260.88
dude

2257.04 --> 2264.32
that's no it's more like derpcon one

2260.88 --> 2264.32
just awkward and off topic

2276.72 --> 2280.72
or maybe he's talking about trolls

2282.079 --> 2286.32
i mean i do kind of try to leave the

2285.04 --> 2288.48
turds

2286.32 --> 2290.2400000000002
in the chat for as long as i can before

2288.48 --> 2293.64
i flush them so maybe that's what he's

2290.24 --> 2293.64
talking about

2299.92 --> 2304.96
but yeah when it comes to the physical

2302.079 --> 2304.96
world no

2311.52 --> 2316.96
i mean i mean the freaking netherlands

2314.64 --> 2319.04
there's a lot of water here all year

2316.96 --> 2321.28
round

2319.04 --> 2325.56
but i don't waste water i'm very careful

2321.28 --> 2325.5600000000004
with my water consumption nonetheless

2329.44 --> 2332.44
um

2340.88 --> 2344.1600000000003
yeah

2341.68 --> 2346.3999999999996
there's no need to address that

2344.16 --> 2346.3999999999996
uh

2351.68 --> 2354.72
right but i want to get back to what

2353.119 --> 2356.7200000000003
godzilla is at because that was

2354.72 --> 2359.2
interesting words are spells designed by

2356.72 --> 2359.2
the beast

2360.079 --> 2363.44
well designed by man

2364.0 --> 2368.72
but

2365.2 --> 2372.64
used by the beast

2368.72 --> 2374.8799999999997
beast didn't design the words man did

2372.64 --> 2376.7999999999997
they made a trick

2374.88 --> 2378.32
with the word

2376.8 --> 2381.3590000000004
and then the beast

2378.32 --> 2383.04
power power or in people

2381.359 --> 2385.119
is like hey

2383.04 --> 2386.96
that's a neat trick

2385.119 --> 2389.52
we might use that again

2386.96 --> 2389.52
and they do

2391.599 --> 2397.2000000000003
right and the best way to fight it and

2393.839 --> 2398.96
to gain our own powers is to free the

2397.2 --> 2401.04
words right

2398.96 --> 2403.68
if you understand the words if you

2401.04 --> 2406.72
especially look into the history and the

2403.68 --> 2409.04
etymology of words specific words and

2406.72 --> 2411.1189999999997
how they were used

2409.04 --> 2412.96
you gain power

2411.119 --> 2415.359
over them

2412.96 --> 2418.16
truly you do

2415.359 --> 2419.359
so it's always worth it especially with

2418.16 --> 2421.2
these

2419.359 --> 2423.359
supposed

2421.2 --> 2425.9199999999996
evil words

2423.359 --> 2428.72
that well turn out a lot of them just

2425.92 --> 2430.319
aren't evil they're inside out they're

2428.72 --> 2432.48
misleadings

2430.319 --> 2434.4
so the best way you don't have to like

2432.48 --> 2435.359
reinvent language

2434.4 --> 2437.92
just

2435.359 --> 2442.4
master the language that is there

2437.92 --> 2442.4
understand the history and etymology

2442.56 --> 2446.16
the more you understand the more

2446.24 --> 2452.52
you cannot be fooled

2448.64 --> 2452.52
by the language

2464.68 --> 2468.0699999999997
[Music]

2481.68 --> 2486.319
right so uh can we get back to the

2484.48 --> 2489.319
subject

2486.319 --> 2489.319
language

2503.2 --> 2508.319
all right that's right davey z hello

2506.24 --> 2510.4799999999996
yeah they weaponized single words or

2508.319 --> 2512.319
phrases that cause chaos and division

2510.48 --> 2514.64
amongst the populace

2512.319 --> 2518.319
but it only really works because the

2514.64 --> 2520.839
populace isn't mastering the words

2518.319 --> 2524.48
it is basically the

2520.839 --> 2526.24
neglect and sloth of the populace that

2524.48 --> 2530.56
is making

2526.24 --> 2530.56
these weapons of words work

2530.72 --> 2537.839
it's weakness that makes the words work

2533.68 --> 2537.839
there's no weakness they don't work

2579.28 --> 2582.5600000000004
hmm

2579.72 --> 2584.0789999999997
[Music]

2582.56 --> 2587.44
well guard said i wouldn't over

2584.079 --> 2587.44
generalize it like

2590.839 --> 2598.16
that the criticism also has it is ism in

2594.72 --> 2598.16
it did you not know that

2602.24 --> 2607.839
but yeah

2604.48 --> 2607.839
things like globalism

2609.839 --> 2614.4
globalism is just a concept but then it

2612.64 --> 2617.2
got adopted

2614.4 --> 2620.079
and weaponized and abused by a group of

2617.2 --> 2623.2799999999997
people they used the concept as a

2620.079 --> 2623.28
hijacking vehicle

2623.52 --> 2628.16
to try and take over the world right

2625.52 --> 2632.16
environmentalism

2628.16 --> 2635.44
is a really sensible thing

2632.16 --> 2637.52
but then it got basically taken over by

2635.44 --> 2639.76
eugenicists

2637.52 --> 2643.52
that in the end don't actually care

2639.76 --> 2645.0400000000004
about life so they the hostile takeover

2643.52 --> 2647.68
a lot of it

2645.04 --> 2649.92
and like accompanied by a cult that

2647.68 --> 2652.319
makes it impossible for the cultists to

2649.92 --> 2654.599
actually figure out that there is

2652.319 --> 2657.119
a satanic takeover of the

2654.599 --> 2658.079
environmentalism itself

2657.119 --> 2660.079
right

2658.079 --> 2661.599
and racism

2660.079 --> 2664.7200000000003
well racism is not really an

2661.599 --> 2668.0
organization it's just an accusation

2664.72 --> 2670.7999999999997
and it is of course an accusation

2668.0 --> 2674.16
thrown traditionally towards people that

2670.8 --> 2676.0
were actually trying to be conservative

2674.16 --> 2677.87
and do the right thing for for

2676.0 --> 2681.08
themselves

2677.87 --> 2681.08
[Music]

2685.839 --> 2690.68
yeah words are powerful stuff indeed

2696.16 --> 2701.1189999999997
pen is mightier than the sword

2698.88 --> 2704.119
well only if you don't run out of

2701.119 --> 2704.119
inspiration

2712.84 --> 2715.949
[Music]

2718.4 --> 2721.52
yeah

2719.52 --> 2723.44
yeah that's my addendum that's right the

2721.52 --> 2727.64
pen is mightier than the sword

2723.44 --> 2727.64
unless you run out of inspiration

2731.59 --> 2734.7290000000003
[Music]

2738.16 --> 2741.35
[Music]

2742.56 --> 2745.96
or ink

2751.359 --> 2756.52
that that is

2753.52 --> 2756.52
true

2757.78 --> 2761.139
[Music]

2763.76 --> 2768.5200000000004

2781.68 --> 2783.9199999999996
oh

2785.04 --> 2788.56
right

2787.04 --> 2790.64
well you don't really run out of

2788.56 --> 2792.64
keyboards but you might run out of

2790.64 --> 2795.7599999999998
electricity so it's either ink or

2792.64 --> 2795.7599999999998
electricity then

2797.599 --> 2801.839
right because oh but it's whiter than

2799.76 --> 2804.48
the sword yeah unless you ran out of a

2801.839 --> 2806.319
pen or yeah unless you run out of a

2804.48 --> 2807.68
sword so

2806.319 --> 2809.599
that

2807.68 --> 2812.5989999999997
that makes it all

2809.599 --> 2812.599
nonsensical

2823.28 --> 2827.52
to multiple universe no

2828.8 --> 2833.6800000000003
not physically

2831.599 --> 2836.56
i mean there's other dimensions

2833.68 --> 2836.56
considerably

2837.68 --> 2843.44
but no there there's only

2841.2 --> 2843.4399999999996
one

2843.68 --> 2847.1189999999997
physical

2844.8 --> 2847.119
realm

2847.92 --> 2852.64
and it might be segmented up

2851.44 --> 2855.359
right

2852.64 --> 2857.68
but it it is still one just because

2855.359 --> 2860.5589999999997
parts of it might be closed off from one

2857.68 --> 2862.319
another through a loop or whatever

2860.559 --> 2864.2400000000002
broken loop

2862.319 --> 2867.2
but

2864.24 --> 2869.5989999999997
there is one universe

2867.2 --> 2871.68
one physical realm

2869.599 --> 2872.6400000000003
however it is divided

2871.68 --> 2874.72
right

2872.64 --> 2878.4
so think of it like that one physical

2874.72 --> 2880.24
realm one universe one

2878.4 --> 2883.52
physical system

2880.24 --> 2887.72
that but it it was all one

2883.52 --> 2887.72
it might be split up

2887.76 --> 2893.8
now

2889.119 --> 2893.8
but it all originated from one

2906.24 --> 2912.64
do we have any informations now this is

2909.04 --> 2915.359
all just logical reasoning and

2912.64 --> 2918.0
or any sort of cosmogeny

2915.359 --> 2923.2799999999997
cosmology

2918.0 --> 2923.28
ideas from other people and maps and

2925.76 --> 2929.8
and my own ideas

2932.64 --> 2937.04
i'm just every time i approach things

2934.96 --> 2938.8
about the realm especially if i don't

2937.04 --> 2940.72
know it i just

2938.8 --> 2942.4
know there's something

2940.72 --> 2943.9199999999996
i'm always trying to think like a

2942.4 --> 2945.92
designer

2943.92 --> 2948.88
and so there are just these

2945.92 --> 2953.44
i guess sort of axioms almost that come

2948.88 --> 2955.76
rolling out like it has to all be one

2953.44 --> 2958.2400000000002
universe one realm originally and then

2955.76 --> 2960.6400000000003
it might have been split off

2958.24 --> 2965.68
but there were no

2960.64 --> 2965.68
separated born realms you see

2968.72 --> 2973.2
like continents

2971.76 --> 2975.76
right well

2973.2 --> 2978.0
look the entire realm we know

2975.76 --> 2979.0400000000004
might have been part of an even bigger

2978.0 --> 2981.04
realm

2979.04 --> 2984.319
that was then split off into its

2981.04 --> 2986.8
separate loop

2984.319 --> 2986.8
like that

2987.2 --> 2993.4399999999996
and it yeah you could say it

2990.8 --> 2996.44
got separated into continent so it split

2993.44 --> 2996.44
off

3008.16 --> 3011.16
uh

3024.319 --> 3027.319
uh

3032.58 --> 3039.2799999999997
[Music]

3035.28 --> 3039.28
lack of words can be just as powerful

3039.359 --> 3042.72
well that's a tricky saying

3041.599 --> 3044.079
davey z

3042.72 --> 3047.7599999999998
you see

3044.079 --> 3051.44
a lack of words can only be powerful if

3047.76 --> 3054.6400000000003
the preceding words

3051.44 --> 3056.319
need time to sink in right so if

3054.64 --> 3058.64
somebody says something really

3056.319 --> 3060.64
outrageous and ridiculous

3058.64 --> 3062.72
without realizing it in the fray of a

3060.64 --> 3065.92
conversation then

3062.72 --> 3069.04
inserting a silence suddenly

3065.92 --> 3071.599
makes the egregiousness of the preceding

3069.04 --> 3073.359
words really stand out

3071.599 --> 3075.76
so

3073.359 --> 3077.359
technically a lack of words is not

3075.76 --> 3080.079
powerful

3077.359 --> 3080.0789999999997
it's only

3080.48 --> 3083.28
yeah

3081.359 --> 3085.839
it's only the words that are powerful

3083.28 --> 3088.7200000000003
but you can use the power of words

3085.839 --> 3091.2
against somebody that uses them through

3088.72 --> 3091.2
silence

3091.28 --> 3096.48
but without like if it's just silence

3094.079 --> 3098.2400000000002
there's then there isn't there's no

3096.48 --> 3100.72
power

3098.24 --> 3103.839
not worth power anyway it's not gonna

3100.72 --> 3105.839
like stimulate your reasoning

3103.839 --> 3108.0
trainer thinking or anything without

3105.839 --> 3111.7599999999998
words

3108.0 --> 3112.72
but silence can be a powerful rebuttal

3111.76 --> 3113.5200000000004
to

3112.72 --> 3117.04
the

3113.52 --> 3121.16
hastily nonsensical

3117.04 --> 3121.16
that's how i would say it

3128.67 --> 3131.889
[Music]

3137.85 --> 3141.0299999999997
[Music]

3145.599 --> 3151.04
right it's like the silence can be used

3149.92 --> 3154.7200000000003
to

3151.04 --> 3158.64
bend the power of words that preceded it

3154.72 --> 3158.64
so a silent protest right

3159.04 --> 3163.68
a silent protest is about the words that

3161.92 --> 3164.88
have been said

3163.68 --> 3167.04
you see

3164.88 --> 3169.119
a silent protest

3167.04 --> 3171.2799999999997
out of nothing doesn't do anything it's

3169.119 --> 3173.119
just people being silent but if there's

3171.28 --> 3175.8390000000004
been words

3173.119 --> 3178.559
that require careful pondering

3175.839 --> 3180.7999999999997
then certainly a silent protest

3178.559 --> 3183.44
can be very powerful because of the

3180.8 --> 3186.8390000000004
words that preceded it so that's how i

3183.44 --> 3186.839
see it always

3202.0 --> 3204.72
by the way good to have you here in chat

3203.599 --> 3208.44
davey z

3204.72 --> 3208.4399999999996
some really good input

3210.559 --> 3214.44
see you have your own channel

3230.96 --> 3235.0
yeah you're getting rich

3243.92 --> 3249.559
right so yeah any follow-up questions

3246.559 --> 3249.559
x320

3250.16 --> 3252.48
i feel like i'm

3251.52 --> 3255.359
very

3252.48 --> 3255.359
focused today

3262.079 --> 3266.079
stretch of the mind to start today yeah

3264.0 --> 3267.359
well that is kind of what my show is

3266.079 --> 3270.0
intended for

3267.359 --> 3271.5989999999997
unfortunately i'm not always that

3270.0 --> 3273.92
riveting

3271.599 --> 3276.48
and sometimes i can go ballistic as well

3273.92 --> 3280.96
although yeah that does also wake you up

3276.48 --> 3282.88
i guess i hope not in a bad way

3280.96 --> 3285.44
but yeah

3282.88 --> 3287.359
i'm it's a morning show

3285.44 --> 3289.04
even though for me it is the afternoon

3287.359 --> 3291.119
because this is the

3289.04 --> 3293.839
technically the most optimal time slot

3291.119 --> 3293.839
for me

3295.839 --> 3302.92
no it actually makes sense oh okay

3299.2 --> 3302.9199999999996
i'm good to hear x320

3315.839 --> 3318.839
um

3335.2 --> 3339.2799999999997
but yeah the

3336.559 --> 3341.92
the situation yesterday

3339.28 --> 3344.3190000000004
with the prejudice and well what i've

3341.92 --> 3346.48
explained about it now right i bet a lot

3344.319 --> 3349.2799999999997
of you wouldn't expect me to bring that

3346.48 --> 3351.359
back up again like this

3349.28 --> 3353.44
or did you

3351.359 --> 3357.359
did you think i was gonna

3353.44 --> 3357.359
backtrack and say like oh maybe

3358.64 --> 3362.48
that's

3360.64 --> 3364.48
no

3362.48 --> 3366.72
but i've just gotten this entire

3364.48 --> 3368.799
framework realization of

3366.72 --> 3371.7599999999998
well what i've probably been doing like

3368.799 --> 3374.16
what is this oppositional defiance

3371.76 --> 3376.7990000000004
disorder which not actually disorder in

3374.16 --> 3378.799
my opinion

3376.799 --> 3380.559
it is only when you literally ruin

3378.799 --> 3382.319
things for yourself that you didn't want

3380.559 --> 3384.88
to ruin

3382.319 --> 3388.0
right if you do it with an impulse not

3384.88 --> 3389.92
because of a solid backdrop reason

3388.0 --> 3391.68
but because you were just impulsive yeah

3389.92 --> 3393.6800000000003
then it would be a disorder i don't do

3391.68 --> 3394.8799999999997
that i don't ruin things for myself

3393.68 --> 3396.5589999999997
because of it

3394.88 --> 3402.559
but i do

3396.559 --> 3402.559
basically not engage a lot because of it

3402.64 --> 3408.319
because it's like everything is poison

3405.76 --> 3412.4
everybody

3408.319 --> 3414.72
i mean that's kind of normal it's just

3412.4 --> 3414.7200000000003
i

3417.359 --> 3420.16
i don't need it

3425.04 --> 3430.799
i'm going like i'm i'm trying to almost

3427.92 --> 3434.16
bypass society trying to go at the roots

3430.799 --> 3436.16
of all of this crazy reversed world

3434.16 --> 3437.359
stuff that's been unleashed upon all of

3436.16 --> 3439.2799999999997
us

3437.359 --> 3442.0
upon our spirit world

3439.28 --> 3444.96
for generations

3442.0 --> 3447.359
and i'm trying to find the formula

3444.96 --> 3449.28
to basically

3447.359 --> 3452.0
flash purge

3449.28 --> 3453.52
the entire thing

3452.0 --> 3456.24
to find

3453.52 --> 3456.24
the keys

3457.92 --> 3462.4
and i yeah i have found a system and

3460.319 --> 3465.359
that is

3462.4 --> 3470.1600000000003
pull the reversed world trick

3465.359 --> 3470.16
on their reversed world programming

3470.64 --> 3474.72
because yeah if you reverse the reversed

3473.359 --> 3477.359
world guess what you're gonna get you're

3474.72 --> 3481.839
gonna get the real world right and this

3477.359 --> 3482.64
real world might even be re more real

3481.839 --> 3484.0789999999997
than

3482.64 --> 3486.4
you think

3484.079 --> 3489.76
it what is normally real in your

3486.4 --> 3491.599
contemporary state

3489.76 --> 3493.5200000000004
and i've been doing this

3491.599 --> 3496.1600000000003
a little more and more also encouraged

3493.52 --> 3499.52
my own benjamin because

3496.16 --> 3502.8799999999997
to a certain degree he does that too

3499.52 --> 3505.28
it is like a you can separate it and

3502.88 --> 3507.92
choose single subjects to basically

3505.28 --> 3510.1600000000003
counter become master of countering that

3507.92 --> 3513.44
subject

3510.16 --> 3516.5589999999997
or you can like really become almost

3513.44 --> 3519.599
surreal and flip it all inside out and

3516.559 --> 3520.559
i'm going in that direction steadily

3519.599 --> 3522.6400000000003
and

3520.559 --> 3524.079
everybody that's been following me for

3522.64 --> 3526.72
years

3524.079 --> 3529.28
when they hear this they should realize

3526.72 --> 3531.839
very clearly that i've been on that path

3529.28 --> 3531.8390000000004
for a while

3532.64 --> 3537.5989999999997
i've already

3534.799 --> 3539.839
dramatically turned things around in

3537.599 --> 3541.52
ways not as in all my life is so much

3539.839 --> 3544.64
better although it is much better than

3541.52 --> 3547.7599999999998
say five years ago

3544.64 --> 3549.68
but my attitude and like being extremely

3547.76 --> 3552.96
unapologetic

3549.68 --> 3552.96
being intolerant

3555.28 --> 3558.28
being

3560.0 --> 3563.359
[Music]

3562.079 --> 3566.2400000000002
well

3563.359 --> 3569.119
just being honest about

3566.24 --> 3570.319
my homophobia for example but dealing

3569.119 --> 3572.96
with it right

3570.319 --> 3573.68
not letting

3572.96 --> 3575.68
like

3573.68 --> 3577.839
that part is not like oh i'm gonna kill

3575.68 --> 3580.3999999999996
them all no it's like i have

3577.839 --> 3583.7599999999998
an allergy on a spiritual level and

3580.4 --> 3586.319
there is good cause for that and a lot

3583.76 --> 3588.559
of gays have problems because they live

3586.319 --> 3590.24
in this world where it's all made to

3588.559 --> 3592.079
think it's all normal

3590.24 --> 3595.2
when it actually isn't and there's a big

3592.079 --> 3596.319
price and god's not happy

3595.2 --> 3598.3999999999996
unless

3596.319 --> 3600.96
you get it

3598.4 --> 3603.92
and you just see it as almost like a

3600.96 --> 3605.04
burden and then even it out

3603.92 --> 3607.52
with

3605.04 --> 3609.68
positive contributions and there's a lot

3607.52 --> 3610.559
of gays that really get this and those

3609.68 --> 3613.1189999999997
gays

3610.559 --> 3614.559
i think are awesome i usually don't even

3613.119 --> 3616.48
know they're gay

3614.559 --> 3618.7200000000003
i really don't

3616.48 --> 3620.96
and then i'm like oh well

3618.72 --> 3622.3999999999996
oh they're gay well it doesn't really

3620.96 --> 3624.2400000000002
matter because they're great people and

3622.4 --> 3626.88
they're not shoving it in your face and

3624.24 --> 3629.839
being gross

3626.88 --> 3629.839
right

3637.52 --> 3644.319
but yeah i am taking a very oppositional

3640.96 --> 3646.2400000000002
stance to societal norms in many ways

3644.319 --> 3648.72
flat earth was one of them

3646.24 --> 3648.72
of course

3651.68 --> 3656.8799999999997
i almost forget about that sometimes oh

3653.839 --> 3659.119
yeah oh oh by the way i'm a flat earther

3656.88 --> 3662.0
oh yeah

3659.119 --> 3663.359
yeah that's already pretty

3662.0 --> 3664.24
inside out

3663.359 --> 3667.839
for

3664.24 --> 3667.839
yeah for the outside world

3668.079 --> 3674.079
it's that that starting point that

3670.72 --> 3676.8599999999997
that crossroads of the hourglass

3674.079 --> 3680.05
right

3676.86 --> 3680.05
[Music]

3705.28 --> 3709.8390000000004
whoa what is that from godzilla are you

3708.16 --> 3713.5589999999997
reading from

3709.839 --> 3713.5589999999997
is that from a book

3735.44 --> 3740.28
okay gorgeous never heard of that

3807.76 --> 3813.1600000000003
looks like it might be clearing up a bit

3810.16 --> 3813.16
nice

3833.119 --> 3836.96
yeah man i mean it's like i need a bit

3835.599 --> 3839.2000000000003
of a break

3836.96 --> 3841.92
i've pretty much been talking for an

3839.2 --> 3843.4399999999996
hour straight pretty high focused

3841.92 --> 3845.6800000000003
and i'm kind of like done with the

3843.44 --> 3848.4
subject i'm like yeah

3845.68 --> 3850.0
i think i said all i need to say

3848.4 --> 3852.4
if i just continue on it would just

3850.0 --> 3854.4
become blabbering

3852.4 --> 3857.359
like i think i made my points quite

3854.4 --> 3857.359
clear at this point

3858.319 --> 3860.96
it was great

3862.72 --> 3867.7599999999998
i mean in a way also even like my rage

3865.92 --> 3872.0
win

3867.76 --> 3875.92
is now more identified to me as to what

3872.0 --> 3875.92
it actually is what i'm doing

3876.319 --> 3881.0389999999998
right

3877.92 --> 3883.599
because it was originally just born from

3881.039 --> 3885.2000000000003
like i need to express myself or i'm

3883.599 --> 3888.079
just gonna like

3885.2 --> 3890.0
bust a vein or something

3888.079 --> 3891.28
because

3890.0 --> 3895.359
i am

3891.28 --> 3897.3590000000004
a very strong passionate feeling person

3895.359 --> 3900.64
at times

3897.359 --> 3900.64
heavy reactions

3902.0 --> 3906.96
and i need to deal with that and i can't

3905.2 --> 3908.72
hide it like

3906.96 --> 3911.359
i've been

3908.72 --> 3915.68
most of my life i've just hit it because

3911.359 --> 3918.16
when you do that it's like oh i'm just a

3915.68 --> 3920.319
kind of radiant guy that's like very

3918.16 --> 3923.2
confident and like i have no weaknesses

3920.319 --> 3925.2799999999997
because i never get angry

3923.2 --> 3927.68
right that's that seemed like oh that is

3925.28 --> 3929.76
something i want to be just super the

3927.68 --> 3931.839
the cool guy that's never

3929.76 --> 3934.96
always still awake

3931.839 --> 3937.839
it doesn't work it destroys me to do

3934.96 --> 3937.839
that

3940.24 --> 3942.8799999999997
so

3941.92 --> 3945.92
i've

3942.88 --> 3948.839
at some point i just chose like i am

3945.92 --> 3950.559
going to take this spiritual world

3948.839 --> 3953.92
war

3950.559 --> 3956.48
against the darkness to the next level

3953.92 --> 3959.2000000000003
and start expressing myself on a very

3956.48 --> 3963.44
intense level

3959.2 --> 3965.9199999999996
that's very serious and very hardcore

3963.44 --> 3966.88
in the face of a world where that is

3965.92 --> 3970.0
like

3966.88 --> 3972.0
seriously frowned upon and seen as like

3970.0 --> 3974.559
degenerate or

3972.0 --> 3974.559
insane

3974.799 --> 3980.64
i chose to do that

3977.039 --> 3982.079
and to be consistent to actually

3980.64 --> 3984.16
integrate it

3982.079 --> 3986.48
and refine it and

3984.16 --> 3989.7599999999998
make it

3986.48 --> 3991.599
into a utility instead of just like an

3989.76 --> 3993.28
outburst

3991.599 --> 3995.6800000000003
necessity

3993.28 --> 3998.6400000000003
i'm working on it i'm built i'm building

3995.68 --> 3998.64
it into a tool

4000.72 --> 4004.16
i have been for quite a while but i'm

4002.799 --> 4005.44
like

4004.16 --> 4008.48
getting even

4005.44 --> 4008.48
more focused with it

4013.44 --> 4019.359
and like my anger even that part of me

4016.799 --> 4023.7599999999998
is really happy about it

4019.359 --> 4023.7599999999998
because it was born from the will

4024.88 --> 4030.319
to be relevant and to matter

4027.76 --> 4030.3190000000004
basically

4032.64 --> 4037.0389999999998
i could have just kept silent

4034.88 --> 4039.359
at a very young age and have that part

4037.039 --> 4041.28
of me all snuffed out and become kind of

4039.359 --> 4042.96
like a weenie boy

4041.28 --> 4047.76
i could have done that

4042.96 --> 4052.799
but i resisted i resisted violently

4047.76 --> 4052.7990000000004
i've experienced some really crazy [ __ ]

4053.119 --> 4058.799
that i am not gonna just say in public

4056.4 --> 4063.079
ever i think

4058.799 --> 4063.079
i will tell people in private

4064.96 --> 4070.16
and that event

4066.799 --> 4073.359
basically solidified

4070.16 --> 4077.2799999999997
on a very visceral level that

4073.359 --> 4079.52
vengeance against evil is a necessity is

4077.28 --> 4081.92
like a

4079.52 --> 4085.119
like it's there for a reason

4081.92 --> 4089.319
because of that i am not broken

4085.119 --> 4089.319
because of that i am not dead

4091.44 --> 4095.28
then it was instinctually born

4096.88 --> 4101.92
like at a very young age

4100.08 --> 4105.5599999999995
it's like

4101.92 --> 4105.56
sex or something

4113.6 --> 4119.4400000000005
right and i'm not letting it just take

4116.08 --> 4120.64
over and take my mind away right because

4119.44 --> 4123.12
rage

4120.64 --> 4126.2390000000005
you can abuse rage you can abuse rage

4123.12 --> 4127.759
become angry to lose oversight because

4126.239 --> 4128.639999999999
it happens right i've explained it many

4127.759 --> 4130.239
times

4128.64 --> 4132.64
when you're angry

4130.239 --> 4135.599999999999
it changes your perception it makes you

4132.64 --> 4137.92
see things differently it makes you what

4135.6 --> 4139.759
driven towards other directions as

4137.92 --> 4142.96
non-rage

4139.759 --> 4145.199
and you can abuse that and people do

4142.96 --> 4147.359
some people abuse

4145.199 --> 4150.48
getting angry

4147.359 --> 4152.88
to on purpose clout their own mind so

4150.48 --> 4155.2789999999995
they don't have to fear the

4152.88 --> 4157.6
the humiliation and the pain

4155.279 --> 4160.400000000001
of their own weakness or cowardice for

4157.6 --> 4162.159000000001
example right this is natural

4160.4 --> 4165.199
a lot of people in the world should

4162.159 --> 4168.799
recognize that effect people abuse their

4165.199 --> 4170.639999999999
rage to temporarily lose cognition so

4168.799 --> 4172.64
they don't have to face like the

4170.64 --> 4175.12
torturous pain

4172.64 --> 4176.159000000001
of humiliation

4175.12 --> 4177.839
this is

4176.159 --> 4181.5199999999995
basic this is

4177.839 --> 4184.0
like literally kids in school stuff

4181.52 --> 4186.839000000001
and it is natural

4184.0 --> 4191.04
right i've

4186.839 --> 4194.32
really focused on preventing that

4191.04 --> 4197.5199999999995
so i always apply my rage like it is a

4194.32 --> 4198.639999999999
divine tool like it's holy

4197.52 --> 4199.92
never

4198.64 --> 4201.52
abuse it

4199.92 --> 4205.52
and never

4201.52 --> 4207.84
like flee into rage

4205.52 --> 4208.88
because of weakness although it does

4207.84 --> 4211.6
still

4208.88 --> 4213.1990000000005
trigger spark rage and then i have to

4211.6 --> 4215.04
deal with it it's like oh i i got

4213.199 --> 4217.759999999999
accidentally pissed off because i'm

4215.04 --> 4219.84
troll just like right in the wrong

4217.76 --> 4222.88
moment said like this one thing that i

4219.84 --> 4224.719
couldn't handle and then

4222.88 --> 4228.400000000001
right but then immediately

4224.719 --> 4230.159
after me like oh oh wait but

4228.4 --> 4232.239
just because i triggered is not an

4230.159 --> 4234.719
excuse to actually let go it got

4232.239 --> 4236.239
triggered i can't just then

4234.719 --> 4238.32
i just start

4236.239 --> 4240.4
smashing [ __ ]

4238.32 --> 4242.32
right

4240.4 --> 4244.799999999999
so i have this discipline of dealing

4242.32 --> 4247.199
with the rage

4244.8 --> 4248.96
i always realize you look at things

4247.199 --> 4251.839999999999
differently

4248.96 --> 4253.36
you have more you access more

4251.84 --> 4256.08
force

4253.36 --> 4258.4
so you need to know that

4256.08 --> 4260.48
it has more impact be more responsible

4258.4 --> 4263.199
it's like you're enraged that means you

4260.48 --> 4265.678999999999
need to be even more responsible

4263.199 --> 4267.28
that's how i try to deal with it

4265.679 --> 4268.4800000000005
and it's tough because when you're in

4267.28 --> 4271.04
rage

4268.48 --> 4273.28
it's more easy to relinquish them to

4271.04 --> 4274.8
just throw it off and go at it right

4273.28 --> 4276.5599999999995
that's

4274.8 --> 4279.679
part of it

4276.56 --> 4279.679
it's more seductive

4281.84 --> 4286.8
i know this all from experience the

4283.679 --> 4288.4800000000005
experience has been all on record here

4286.8 --> 4291.84
on my show

4288.48 --> 4291.839999999999
for the last three years

4292.48 --> 4297.36
i'm studying

4294.8 --> 4299.1990000000005
human elements

4297.36 --> 4302.719
in myself and others

4299.199 --> 4305.5199999999995
and i'm learning to deal with this

4302.719 --> 4307.36
i'm learning to actually master

4305.52 --> 4310.2390000000005
my rage

4307.36 --> 4313.96
which funnily enough d d would be like a

4310.239 --> 4313.959999999999
barbarian skill

4323.679 --> 4329.04
to just know what is rage it has a

4326.8 --> 4329.92
purpose it changes the way you look at

4329.04 --> 4332.88
things

4329.92 --> 4335.1990000000005
it gives you some edges

4332.88 --> 4337.36
right because somebody else being

4335.199 --> 4340.719
enraged for the right reason

4337.36 --> 4343.199
can be very dominating in a good way

4340.719 --> 4346.32
i mean i like it when somebody's like

4343.199 --> 4348.48
really pissed off but in control

4346.32 --> 4350.5599999999995
because of a justified reason and they

4348.48 --> 4352.48
make a stand right they make it they

4350.56 --> 4353.92
defend

4352.48 --> 4356.799999999999
the good

4353.92 --> 4358.32
that's exhilarating

4356.8 --> 4360.719
so

4358.32 --> 4362.48
it's like you rage can be like a

4360.719 --> 4365.52
knight's armor

4362.48 --> 4368.839999999999
but if you don't take the knight's foul

4365.52 --> 4372.400000000001
then you're just a

4368.84 --> 4372.400000000001
thug right

4382.8 --> 4386.56
right then you're just math

4384.96 --> 4388.4
you're just a

4386.56 --> 4391.280000000001
highwayman or something

4388.4 --> 4393.12
you don't actually then also take up the

4391.28 --> 4398.28
night's vow

4393.12 --> 4398.28
with that power of the ridge right

4406.08 --> 4410.88
i abuse my silence when i should be

4408.56 --> 4413.04
expressing gratitude

4410.88 --> 4416.4800000000005
oh

4413.04 --> 4416.48
why why would you do that

4418.239 --> 4422.32
unless you're just using it from a

4420.32 --> 4424.159
dominant perspective to kind of motivate

4422.32 --> 4427.04
somebody i mean

4424.159 --> 4429.679
always expressing gratitude can to some

4427.04 --> 4430.719
people be

4429.679 --> 4432.64
like

4430.719 --> 4435.28
too comforting and then they'll make

4432.64 --> 4437.52
less effort it sounds really harsh but

4435.28 --> 4439.28
that's how it works

4437.52 --> 4441.52
it's like a teacher that is like too

4439.28 --> 4442.8
complementary

4441.52 --> 4445.4400000000005
tends to

4442.8 --> 4448.0
end up with lazy students

4445.44 --> 4450.48
right well a teacher that's hard

4448.0 --> 4452.159
and that's like not making it easy for

4450.48 --> 4454.5199999999995
you to get a compliment

4452.159 --> 4455.839999999999
those students end up like very

4454.52 --> 4458.159000000001
[Music]

4455.84 --> 4461.360000000001
very well trained

4458.159 --> 4461.36
they make a lot more effort

4462.56 --> 4464.8
so

4465.12 --> 4468.48
right

4466.88 --> 4471.04
gratitude

4468.48 --> 4473.919999999999
is important to have especially on the

4471.04 --> 4477.04
inside right gratitude towards creation

4473.92 --> 4479.28
god towards your understanding

4477.04 --> 4480.8
how things work and will work out

4479.28 --> 4483.44
gratitude is important but that doesn't

4480.8 --> 4484.719
mean that you always have to ex be

4483.44 --> 4488.0
grateful

4484.719 --> 4490.4800000000005
expressively to everybody always

4488.0 --> 4492.56
because that just turns everybody into a

4490.48 --> 4495.5599999999995
wussy

4492.56 --> 4495.56
really

4496.239 --> 4500.48
i mean don't

4497.679 --> 4501.76
even it's not like never express it

4500.48 --> 4504.5599999999995
because then

4501.76 --> 4505.92
that's like yeah then it becomes

4504.56 --> 4508.400000000001
cut off

4505.92 --> 4510.32
but just save it for the right moment

4508.4 --> 4512.48
and actually

4510.32 --> 4514.48
don't make it cheap to just don't throw

4512.48 --> 4515.919999999999
out cheap compliments

4514.48 --> 4518.48
make it real

4515.92 --> 4520.159
use a moment to actually analyze how

4518.48 --> 4522.5599999999995
somebody is better

4520.159 --> 4523.44
how they're dealing with the situation

4522.56 --> 4525.120000000001
well

4523.44 --> 4527.5199999999995
you explain to somebody that you

4525.12 --> 4530.48
understand how they work in a good way

4527.52 --> 4532.64
that is motivating to hear for them

4530.48 --> 4534.959999999999
that's a better compliment than just say

4532.64 --> 4537.360000000001
oh you're doing great

4534.96 --> 4539.84
although to hear you're doing great can

4537.36 --> 4543.719
be great at times especially if you're

4539.84 --> 4543.719
kind of nervous or something

4568.4 --> 4571.199
okay

4569.28 --> 4575.28
they see

4571.199 --> 4575.28
that's not literally what i said though

4575.679 --> 4580.96
i know it's wrong to act a fool

4578.48 --> 4585.5199999999995
if i fly off the handle i have a way to

4580.96 --> 4585.52
justify being a dick that's a weird

4586.96 --> 4592.36
yeah where are you getting that from is

4588.56 --> 4592.360000000001
that a quote from a book

4597.12 --> 4601.04
i mean

4598.08 --> 4603.6
being angry to me is not always

4601.04 --> 4603.6
foolish

4606.0 --> 4614.159
this this myth that all anger anger is

4609.84 --> 4616.719
bad anger is not with christ like dude

4614.159 --> 4618.879999999999
this is part of the mind control

4616.719 --> 4620.0
indoctrination this is the reversed

4618.88 --> 4621.6
world

4620.0 --> 4623.28
yeah

4621.6 --> 4626.320000000001
rage

4623.28 --> 4628.5599999999995
justified anger is good

4626.32 --> 4631.36
is with god

4628.56 --> 4634.84
jesus did it on occasion as well

4631.36 --> 4634.839999999999
very important

4637.28 --> 4643.44
yeah so everybody oh i don't trust that

4639.6 --> 4647.1990000000005
person because he gets too angry

4643.44 --> 4647.199
good luck with that people

4649.04 --> 4652.64
i mean i'm not

4650.48 --> 4655.678999999999
having that tip cut off

4652.64 --> 4658.159000000001
from me i'm not i'm not doing that

4655.679 --> 4660.56
i'm keeping it the way

4658.159 --> 4662.159
it was designed within me

4660.56 --> 4665.4400000000005
from the start

4662.159 --> 4668.239
i'm trusting it has a function because

4665.44 --> 4668.239
it exists

4669.52 --> 4675.320000000001
i'm not gonna snip the tip off that

4677.7 --> 4681.42
[Music]

4684.15 --> 4687.679999999999
[Music]

4691.44 --> 4695.159
ah

4691.96 --> 4695.159
[Music]

4698.96 --> 4702.56
okay davisee that's fine

4701.679 --> 4704.88
right

4702.56 --> 4708.719
well there's plenty of people that

4704.88 --> 4710.96
will just be very good at justify being

4708.719 --> 4713.04
a dick right

4710.96 --> 4715.92
there's a lot of people that are angry

4713.04 --> 4718.239
and that are too proud to actually admit

4715.92 --> 4720.56
that they're doing wrong with it so they

4718.239 --> 4723.919999999999
are get very good at trying to justify

4720.56 --> 4725.679
it smooth it over instead of

4723.92 --> 4727.36
learning

4725.679 --> 4730.0
from it

4727.36 --> 4732.32
getting better at it and showing like

4730.0 --> 4732.32
yeah

4732.4 --> 4738.0
this is why it was there

4735.84 --> 4739.360000000001
this is when i went too far i'll do my

4738.0 --> 4741.84
best to

4739.36 --> 4744.88
get more control over that

4741.84 --> 4748.08
this part was justified right

4744.88 --> 4751.36
get into it analyze it don't just let it

4748.08 --> 4755.36
be and then oh no no no oh here's a new

4751.36 --> 4756.799999999999
story and why it's all great and just

4755.36 --> 4760.759999999999
forget about it

4756.8 --> 4760.76
that's what most people do

4762.88 --> 4768.719
right if you just avoid anger

4766.48 --> 4771.678999999999
then you can't master it

4768.719 --> 4774.8
and it will

4771.679 --> 4776.88
through you become a vulnerability

4774.8 --> 4778.4800000000005
because if you don't master your

4776.88 --> 4782.92
abilities

4778.48 --> 4782.919999999999
something else will

4784.69 --> 4787.879999999999
[Music]

4791.92 --> 4795.76
you can have a good guess as to what

4793.6 --> 4798.909000000001
that something else is

4795.76 --> 4798.909000000001
[Music]

4819.679 --> 4821.92
right

4824.56 --> 4829.1990000000005
well davis you can use rage like that as

4826.96 --> 4832.159
well you rage is like a sport it gets

4829.199 --> 4834.5599999999995
your blood flowing right

4832.159 --> 4836.96
i mean if you're like uh i don't want to

4834.56 --> 4837.92
do this or i don't want to go sporting

4836.96 --> 4841.92
or

4837.92 --> 4844.96
then basically to get pissed off

4841.92 --> 4845.76
like to make yourself pissed off again

4844.96 --> 4848.08
that

4845.76 --> 4850.96
kind of helps your blood flow right it

4848.08 --> 4853.6
can also ruin your mood by the way

4850.96 --> 4857.199
but for some people it's like even the

4853.6 --> 4860.320000000001
military employee employ that tactic

4857.199 --> 4861.5199999999995
it's just like

4860.32 --> 4863.44
at you

4861.52 --> 4865.6
talking down to you patronizing you

4863.44 --> 4868.719
shaving you like hey are you wussy are

4865.6 --> 4868.719
you wussy right

4868.88 --> 4872.88
it's because they get up very early and

4870.96 --> 4875.679
then they have to get focused quickly

4872.88 --> 4878.159000000001
well anger

4875.679 --> 4881.12
anger gets the blood flowing including

4878.159 --> 4883.839999999999
to your brain to focus right potentially

4881.12 --> 4885.44
because anger also can arise naturally

4883.84 --> 4888.2390000000005
in

4885.44 --> 4890.0
human domination struggles so when

4888.239 --> 4893.04
you're angry you're

4890.0 --> 4896.4
gonna have that impulse like oh yeah

4893.04 --> 4898.08
i might need to actually bash somebody's

4896.4 --> 4900.159
face in

4898.08 --> 4903.36
to dominate

4900.159 --> 4904.879999999999
so you need the sharpness of mind enough

4903.36 --> 4908.159
to

4904.88 --> 4911.1990000000005
not just get rammed and dominated that's

4908.159 --> 4913.36
what anger does all kinds of things to

4911.199 --> 4917.839999999999
your instincts in your mind

4913.36 --> 4917.839999999999
right so you can use it

4918.88 --> 4923.1990000000005
you could also abuse it

4921.04 --> 4926.239
but yeah you can get angry just to wake

4923.199 --> 4927.919999999999
yourself up i actually used to do that a

4926.239 --> 4931.678999999999
couple of times in school when i was

4927.92 --> 4933.52
like really drowsy like uh

4931.679 --> 4935.52
and i would just start slapping myself

4933.52 --> 4939.040000000001
the kids would laugh at me because i

4935.52 --> 4939.040000000001
would start slapping myself

4939.36 --> 4942.4
to get pissed off

4943.679 --> 4948.96
usually eventually i didn't do it like

4946.4 --> 4951.44
it among the rest i just like went to

4948.96 --> 4953.12
the bathroom and did something like that

4951.44 --> 4956.0
and it's not like oh he's abusing it

4953.12 --> 4961.199
himself no it's just like like getting

4956.0 --> 4961.199
pissed off like wake the [ __ ] up

4964.0 --> 4967.0
so

4977.12 --> 4982.08
that determines what the garden will be

4978.56 --> 4982.080000000001
yeah it's true borders boy

4983.44 --> 4988.48
all right well i've planted the seed of

4986.08 --> 4988.48
anger

4989.28 --> 4995.04
it was there

4992.0 --> 4997.679
almost nobody's using it it's like being

4995.04 --> 5000.48
societally abandoned that's a sign to me

4997.679 --> 5002.4
like the devil is attacking us once

5000.48 --> 5004.5599999999995
again

5002.4 --> 5007.92
they're trying to make you

5004.56 --> 5010.4800000000005
relinquish your natural instincts

5007.92 --> 5014.0
through philosophical collective

5010.48 --> 5017.04
reasoning i'm so i am going to plant

5014.0 --> 5017.04
that seed then

5018.08 --> 5023.44
because apparently it's important enough

5020.32 --> 5027.12
to indoctrinate everybody over

5023.44 --> 5031.759999999999
generations to lay it down

5027.12 --> 5031.76
so i am going to then sow that seed

5033.52 --> 5039.719
psyching yourself up sort of thing yeah

5035.36 --> 5039.719
exactly matthew hall like that

5046.8 --> 5051.12
bodybuilding and fighting yeah yeah i

5049.04 --> 5053.76
bet it is that would work that works

5051.12 --> 5057.04
great yeah

5053.76 --> 5060.639
i did use did used to do it a bit too

5057.04 --> 5060.639
when i would go to taekwondo

5062.88 --> 5068.08
like if i felt a bit like

5065.199 --> 5069.28
then i just like just thinking about

5068.08 --> 5071.04
girl getting

5069.28 --> 5072.8
a lot of the times

5071.04 --> 5075.28
because yeah when i went to taekwondo i

5072.8 --> 5076.96
was still kind of dealing with [ __ ] from

5075.28 --> 5079.199
the past where i would get seriously

5076.96 --> 5081.36
bullied and i'd be fantasizing about

5079.199 --> 5082.96
basically

5081.36 --> 5085.759999999999
yeah

5082.96 --> 5088.0
beefing up to basically go after them

5085.76 --> 5089.52
and show them bash them

5088.0 --> 5091.84
in the head right

5089.52 --> 5095.52
petty fantasy i never done that by the

5091.84 --> 5096.719
way but i d dude i was really

5095.52 --> 5098.88
bullied

5096.719 --> 5101.12
like it really got to me

5098.88 --> 5104.88
i couldn't even show everybody how much

5101.12 --> 5107.599999999999
it got to me i responded stoically to it

5104.88 --> 5109.28
but like the full pain the humiliation

5107.6 --> 5111.120000000001
got to me a lot

5109.28 --> 5115.28
back then it drove me mad to

5111.12 --> 5117.92
hallucination at some point even

5115.28 --> 5120.719
so i did have like revenge fantasies

5117.92 --> 5123.6
that i would use to like

5120.719 --> 5126.56
yeah get myself going

5123.6 --> 5128.8
in like fighting sports

5126.56 --> 5131.52
but i would never actually do it because

5128.8 --> 5133.4400000000005
in the physical reality i really dislike

5131.52 --> 5137.56
hurting people

5133.44 --> 5137.5599999999995
i really don't like it

5157.28 --> 5162.4
stopping and taking a deep breath can

5159.199 --> 5162.4
save lives literally

5164.48 --> 5170.32
well if you're raging out of control

5167.04 --> 5172.32
right i mean if you are angry and you're

5170.32 --> 5174.799999999999
noticing that the energy buildup is too

5172.32 --> 5176.96
much and you're losing control like

5174.8 --> 5178.8
you're gonna go berserk right

5176.96 --> 5181.36
it's a difference you know

5178.8 --> 5183.28
there's a difference between rage and

5181.36 --> 5186.239
berserk it's funny because that

5183.28 --> 5188.639
difference is very well marketed within

5186.239 --> 5191.04
the dungeons and dragon system

5188.639 --> 5193.679
it's really it is it's a big difference

5191.04 --> 5197.6
because rage

5193.679 --> 5200.0
is like extra strength extra brawn

5197.6 --> 5204.8
and you lose a bit of focus right for

5200.0 --> 5204.8
example you can't read or cast the spell

5205.52 --> 5209.52
when you're enraged

5207.36 --> 5212.5599999999995
berserk is like

5209.52 --> 5214.400000000001
even more but then you lose control over

5212.56 --> 5217.04
your faculties and can potentially

5214.4 --> 5218.5599999999995
attack your allies you just start

5217.04 --> 5220.32
attacking whatever is closest to you

5218.56 --> 5222.080000000001
that's berserk

5220.32 --> 5226.08
if you're noticing you're going from

5222.08 --> 5228.639
rage to berserk then yeah

5226.08 --> 5230.0
will save literally that's what you need

5228.639 --> 5231.52
a will save

5230.0 --> 5233.84
in the dungeon dragon system to stop

5231.52 --> 5236.639
berserk you need a will save

5233.84 --> 5239.6
like stop it

5236.639 --> 5241.36
calm down nice

5239.6 --> 5244.320000000001
spring breeze

5241.36 --> 5244.32
a waterfall

5247.679 --> 5251.6
yeah

5249.12 --> 5252.639
when you go berserk you definitely

5251.6 --> 5255.280000000001
need to

5252.639 --> 5258.0
retreat rethink

5255.28 --> 5260.159
what did you say stop take a deep breath

5258.0 --> 5262.4
because you could save lives but with

5260.159 --> 5263.599999999999
rage you don't really need that you just

5262.4 --> 5267.36
need to

5263.6 --> 5269.360000000001
keep your wits about well you have that

5267.36 --> 5271.36
if you can control there's people that

5269.36 --> 5273.04
can't control that sliding skill when

5271.36 --> 5275.5199999999995
they go to rage

5273.04 --> 5277.199
then they go to berserk right they can't

5275.52 --> 5279.76
stop it

5277.199 --> 5282.159
so be very careful if you have that and

5279.76 --> 5284.88
you always go berserk

5282.159 --> 5287.839999999999
well i wouldn't blame you if you'd say

5284.88 --> 5290.159000000001
like yeah i'm just getting all anger out

5287.84 --> 5293.28
because it's too dangerous

5290.159 --> 5297.92
because i go berserk right but if that

5293.28 --> 5299.679
happened one time as a teenager

5297.92 --> 5301.92
that's not a good reason

5299.679 --> 5304.8
because that's when you're a teenager

5301.92 --> 5306.8
and when you're a teenager

5304.8 --> 5309.76
the stepping stones

5306.8 --> 5312.719
are shifted right so when you get

5309.76 --> 5316.96
enraged as a teenager it's much easier

5312.719 --> 5316.96
to go berserk than when you get older

5317.36 --> 5321.44
right

5319.199 --> 5323.759999999999
like those stepping stones are like much

5321.44 --> 5325.5199999999995
easier much closer and sometimes they're

5323.76 --> 5327.84
like a curse because you you

5325.52 --> 5330.639
accidentally

5327.84 --> 5332.639
walk all the way up

5330.639 --> 5333.84
too quickly that typically happens as a

5332.639 --> 5336.08
teenager

5333.84 --> 5338.719
right if if you think that those types

5336.08 --> 5341.04
of experience unless you like constantly

5338.719 --> 5343.12
raging right if you're like a real

5341.04 --> 5346.239
madman constantly getting into fights

5343.12 --> 5348.0
and [ __ ] as a teenager right

5346.239 --> 5351.44
that might be a good reason to just

5348.0 --> 5353.84
completely lay it down because you can't

5351.44 --> 5356.239
get a grip on it it's too much

5353.84 --> 5359.04
but if you just had that one

5356.239 --> 5362.239
time where things got out of control

5359.04 --> 5362.239
that's not a good reason

5363.44 --> 5368.32
right because when you grow older

5369.04 --> 5371.679
that's going to be much more under

5370.639 --> 5374.719
control

5371.679 --> 5376.8
so are you just going to relinquish

5374.719 --> 5379.44
your anger and not learn to deal with it

5376.8 --> 5382.400000000001
and learn to deal with rage

5379.44 --> 5384.879999999999
just because you had that one a bit out

5382.4 --> 5386.48
of control experience in your teens

5384.88 --> 5389.12
to me that sounds like a wasted

5386.48 --> 5389.12
opportunity

5390.96 --> 5395.92
i mean while you're a teenager and you

5393.36 --> 5397.36
had that yeah i get it it's dangerous

5395.92 --> 5399.52
you might want to avoid it when you get

5397.36 --> 5400.049999999999
a bit older you might want to re-look

5399.52 --> 5401.4400000000005
into it

5400.05 --> 5404.719
[Music]

5401.44 --> 5406.879999999999
don't be afraid don't be afraid that

5404.719 --> 5408.4800000000005
just because it went out of control as a

5406.88 --> 5411.04
teenager it's always going to be like

5408.48 --> 5414.4
that no it won't

5411.04 --> 5416.239
right again unless it's constant and but

5414.4 --> 5418.08
yeah if it's constant rich and goes out

5416.239 --> 5420.638999999999
of control as a teenager you'll probably

5418.08 --> 5423.12
end up in juvenile hall or [ __ ] or psych

5420.639 --> 5425.04
ward so

5423.12 --> 5427.679
but if it's just that one time or a

5425.04 --> 5429.76
couple of times that you had a hard time

5427.679 --> 5431.36
dealing with your anger as a teenager

5429.76 --> 5433.52
that doesn't mean it's always going to

5431.36 --> 5435.92
be that problematic when you grow older

5433.52 --> 5438.96
just know that

5435.92 --> 5438.96
don't be afraid

5440.639 --> 5446.56
don't be afraid of anger it's a natural

5444.239 --> 5449.759999999999
ability there's all kinds of good things

5446.56 --> 5451.280000000001
you can learn to do with it

5449.76 --> 5454.0
just don't

5451.28 --> 5456.5599999999995
abuse it

5454.0 --> 5458.48
don't think of it as just a power that

5456.56 --> 5460.56
you can just

5458.48 --> 5461.44
abuse

5460.56 --> 5464.88
it's a

5461.44 --> 5466.96
tool that requires some responsibility

5464.88 --> 5468.88
and you need training you need to learn

5466.96 --> 5470.08
how to deal with it and refine your

5468.88 --> 5472.4800000000005
skills

5470.08 --> 5472.48
with it

5472.96 --> 5475.96
anyway

5482.08 --> 5486.08
anger is useless to me in my life now

5485.199 --> 5487.759999999999
okay

5486.08 --> 5491.159
i thought you were tied like that

5487.76 --> 5491.159000000001
borders boy

5493.28 --> 5496.48
but

5494.639 --> 5499.04
it's kind of pointless if you use

5496.48 --> 5499.04
empathy

5499.679 --> 5503.8
and you say anger is useless

5504.0 --> 5508.0
are you really using empathy then

5506.0 --> 5512.48
because i don't think yet you people can

5508.0 --> 5512.48
actually have empathy without anger

5515.04 --> 5519.76
it's part of it's a standard part of the

5517.28 --> 5521.28
spectrum you're gonna be receiving anger

5519.76 --> 5523.4400000000005
you're gonna have to learn to deal with

5521.28 --> 5523.44
it

5523.84 --> 5529.12
and not just discourage everybody from

5527.12 --> 5530.96
anger there's good reasons to be anger

5529.12 --> 5533.76
there's things to be learned from anger

5530.96 --> 5536.8
there's things you can do with anger

5533.76 --> 5538.96
even creative things

5536.8 --> 5540.56
if you just tell everybody to cut it off

5538.96 --> 5542.08
and to abandon

5540.56 --> 5544.320000000001
then

5542.08 --> 5546.719
it's just wasted

5544.32 --> 5549.199
and there's nothing

5546.719 --> 5551.199
it's less energy right anger comes from

5549.199 --> 5553.36
energy

5551.199 --> 5554.719
so i like to say anger

5553.36 --> 5558.5199999999995
is

5554.719 --> 5558.52
unanswered love

5561.199 --> 5564.799999999999
is less energy good

5566.239 --> 5569.919999999999
i don't see it that way i don't think

5568.32 --> 5573.159
less energy

5569.92 --> 5573.159
is good

5574.48 --> 5578.239
right

5575.76 --> 5580.88
i mean if you realize anger

5578.239 --> 5583.44
is an answered love

5580.88 --> 5586.08
well that just means it's love then so

5583.44 --> 5586.08
is less

5586.639 --> 5591.4400000000005
love good

5588.96 --> 5594.32
because you're gonna like attempt to cut

5591.44 --> 5596.799999999999
down the energy output that is leading

5594.32 --> 5601.719
to that anger when you do that

5596.8 --> 5601.719
is that good is less energy good

5602.4 --> 5606.48
i mean if you have absolutely no control

5604.56 --> 5609.280000000001
over that amount of energy inside of you

5606.48 --> 5611.44
then i'd say yeah okay maybe

5609.28 --> 5612.88
or you could actually learn to train it

5611.44 --> 5614.5599999999995
and deal with it

5612.88 --> 5617.36
and master it

5614.56 --> 5618.56
and then you have more and then one day

5617.36 --> 5620.96
perhaps

5618.56 --> 5622.8
all that anger that was originally

5620.96 --> 5624.8
unanswered love

5622.8 --> 5628.320000000001
might flip around

5624.8 --> 5628.320000000001
and answer that love

5628.84 --> 5634.88
yeah sounds a bit mystical but i'm

5631.52 --> 5637.4400000000005
saying some very intense esoteric

5634.88 --> 5640.159000000001
potential truth here

5637.44 --> 5640.159
i believe it

5642.4 --> 5646.4
yeah i know it does sound a little bit

5644.4 --> 5648.239
like darth vader doesn't it well i think

5646.4 --> 5650.879999999999
that darth vader

5648.239 --> 5650.879999999999
is a trick

5655.28 --> 5660.719
right star wars in that sense is a trick

5658.88 --> 5662.08
it made

5660.719 --> 5665.199
anger

5662.08 --> 5667.84
into the bad guy

5665.199 --> 5670.799999999999
i mean hatred is not good by the way

5667.84 --> 5673.360000000001
right but anger

5670.8 --> 5674.56
anger is not evil

5673.36 --> 5676.48
it's just

5674.56 --> 5677.84
different

5676.48 --> 5679.5199999999995
it's funny because some of the things

5677.84 --> 5680.639
they say

5679.52 --> 5684.88
is true

5680.639 --> 5684.88
it's easier more seductive

5685.36 --> 5691.119
does it always lead to hatred

5689.119 --> 5692.48
no it doesn't

5691.119 --> 5694.719
only

5692.48 --> 5698.159
when you don't deal with it responsibly

5694.719 --> 5701.84
and you give in to the seductions that

5698.159 --> 5701.839999999999
come with the anger

5701.92 --> 5706.719
if you don't do that if you master it

5707.92 --> 5713.8
it could be a

5709.119 --> 5713.799999999999
very useful asset

5725.84 --> 5730.639
right isn't that just

5727.52 --> 5732.88
a remarkable little trixie

5730.639 --> 5736.2390000000005
hidden in the most popular one of the

5732.88 --> 5739.28
most popular movies of all times

5736.239 --> 5741.36
and we loved it for it we loved it for

5739.28 --> 5742.88
it because it put it down in a certain

5741.36 --> 5746.5599999999995
iconography

5742.88 --> 5751.4400000000005
that was by the way very jewish

5746.56 --> 5754.080000000001
that we accept it it said anger bad

5751.44 --> 5756.159
anger bad leads to hatred and oh then

5754.08 --> 5758.719
you become like the emperor a maniac

5756.159 --> 5760.5599999999995
that electrocutes people

5758.719 --> 5762.32
and kills everybody

5760.56 --> 5765.4400000000005
that's what it was

5762.32 --> 5768.799999999999
and we all loved it we loved it for it

5765.44 --> 5770.96
it put it down and we said yes

5768.8 --> 5773.4400000000005
of course

5770.96 --> 5774.719
and now

5773.44 --> 5775.839999999999
what is it

5774.719 --> 5778.8
like

5775.84 --> 5779.84
45 years later i'm saying

5778.8 --> 5784.4800000000005
wait

5779.84 --> 5787.6
it was flipped inside out wasn't it yes

5784.48 --> 5787.599999999999
of course it was

5787.76 --> 5793.04
anger doesn't have to lead to hatred

5791.04 --> 5794.08
it's actually

5793.04 --> 5796.08
quick

5794.08 --> 5797.36
and more seductive

5796.08 --> 5798.4
yeah

5797.36 --> 5801.36
the quick

5798.4 --> 5803.759999999999
is the good part the more seductive is

5801.36 --> 5806.239
the challenging part that you have to

5803.76 --> 5806.2390000000005
deal with

5808.56 --> 5814.0
it's hidden there right in plain sight

5812.159 --> 5814.96
but you

5814.0 --> 5816.639
took

5814.96 --> 5817.76
the bigger bite

5816.639 --> 5819.679
and thought

5817.76 --> 5822.96
anger bad

5819.679 --> 5825.4400000000005
anger makes you into evil electrocuting

5822.96 --> 5825.44
emperor

5825.6 --> 5829.92
it's a trick was it a piece of truth

5828.159 --> 5831.36
there

5829.92 --> 5833.679
isolated

5831.36 --> 5838.599999999999
and hidden in a wider picture that

5833.679 --> 5838.6
malformed the way you look at it

5839.79 --> 5842.97
[Music]

5843.52 --> 5847.4400000000005
yeah that's right if you let it go too

5845.199 --> 5847.44
far

5851.119 --> 5853.759999999999
right

5852.88 --> 5855.679
but

5853.76 --> 5857.84
some anger

5855.679 --> 5860.639
if you have it in balance if you don't

5857.84 --> 5860.639
let it grow

5862.4 --> 5865.36
too much right

5865.6 --> 5870.320000000001
like if you have no anger

5868.96 --> 5871.36
when you're like

5870.32 --> 5873.44
facing

5871.36 --> 5875.36
like an enemy that actually wants to

5873.44 --> 5879.759999999999
kill you right

5875.36 --> 5879.759999999999
how are you gonna resolve that conflict

5879.84 --> 5883.28
right

5881.199 --> 5885.678999999999
now of course constantly feeding it like

5883.28 --> 5887.679
oh i want to catch you

5885.679 --> 5890.4
yeah that weakachi that makes it

5887.679 --> 5892.08
stronger the seductions you will lose

5890.4 --> 5895.679
your faculties right that's when you

5892.08 --> 5899.6
feed too much into it but some anger is

5895.679 --> 5899.6
very good it focuses you

5902.239 --> 5907.839999999999
i mean

5903.44 --> 5908.96
how you expect like luke skywalker

5907.84 --> 5912.159000000001
in

5908.96 --> 5912.159
return of the jedi

5912.88 --> 5917.6
in the third original star wars how do

5915.199 --> 5919.919999999999
you expect him to basically go at it

5917.6 --> 5923.1990000000005
with the emperor

5919.92 --> 5924.719
if he did not have any level of just

5923.199 --> 5929.119
like

5924.719 --> 5929.119
these are bad people very dangerous

5932.0 --> 5936.4
right you

5933.52 --> 5939.52
you gotta have some anger just don't

5936.4 --> 5941.199
like gosh don't over focus don't use it

5939.52 --> 5943.84
as an escape

5941.199 --> 5946.799999999999
when you're afraid right because fear

5943.84 --> 5948.639
fear is not good fear is never good

5946.8 --> 5951.119000000001
anger can be good

5948.639 --> 5953.76
you have fear

5951.119 --> 5956.639
then you might be seduced to use the

5953.76 --> 5959.84
anger to escape from the fear

5956.639 --> 5962.4800000000005
because anger does blot out fear

5959.84 --> 5965.1990000000005
but then if the fear

5962.48 --> 5967.5199999999995
is too much or gross

5965.199 --> 5969.28
then the anger can basically start

5967.52 --> 5971.360000000001
overwhelming you because now you're

5969.28 --> 5974.32
actually using it as an escape because

5971.36 --> 5977.839999999999
you can't face the fear and that's

5974.32 --> 5977.84
how it turns into hatred

5978.8 --> 5983.52
because you're actually using the anger

5981.04 --> 5985.92
to escape

5983.52 --> 5988.159000000001
to escape the fear

5985.92 --> 5990.639
that's dangerous

5988.159 --> 5993.04
that's when you can become possessed by

5990.639 --> 5993.04
anger

5993.6 --> 5996.2390000000005
and hatred

5997.679 --> 6002.159
see it's all

6000.08 --> 6006.8
a little bit more sophisticated and

6002.159 --> 6006.799999999999
complicated than the original star wars

6007.04 --> 6012.32
spirit cosmology

6009.04 --> 6012.32
was basically telling you

6013.36 --> 6018.48
in reality because we do deal with our

6016.0 --> 6020.719
emotions and they do give us

6018.48 --> 6025.239
a measure of strength

6020.719 --> 6025.2390000000005
and challenges that come with it

6040.8 --> 6044.320000000001
stillness in the moment yeah well that's

6042.239 --> 6046.5599999999995
called focus right

6044.32 --> 6049.199
if you're angry you'll have more trouble

6046.56 --> 6051.119000000001
focusing so if you're gonna do something

6049.199 --> 6054.159
really special

6051.119 --> 6057.679
then anger will probably get in the way

6054.159 --> 6060.159
but when you're socially interacting

6057.679 --> 6061.84
a little bit of anger can

6060.159 --> 6065.119
actually

6061.84 --> 6066.96
be very motivating

6065.119 --> 6070.759999999999
and not like in

6066.96 --> 6070.76
in a scary way

6072.87 --> 6076.55
[Music]

6079.84 --> 6082.84
okay

6095.04 --> 6099.119
and dealt with anger yeah

6097.199 --> 6101.36
yeah that's right if you pot it up you

6099.119 --> 6103.839999999999
don't express it if you hold it in

6101.36 --> 6106.48
it's usually just gonna like

6103.84 --> 6109.04
get more compacted and more dangerous

6106.48 --> 6112.32
like the cycles will go higher and it

6109.04 --> 6115.6
will it will turn into

6112.32 --> 6118.88
rage on the inside a rage kept on the

6115.6 --> 6120.8
inside is actually kind of damaging

6118.88 --> 6122.639
right and then if further

6120.8 --> 6124.320000000001
it might actually become too much and

6122.639 --> 6126.2390000000005
then you express it but guess what when

6124.32 --> 6128.96
you then express it it will express

6126.239 --> 6132.159
itself in a berserk action that you have

6128.96 --> 6134.4
not learned to deal with

6132.159 --> 6136.719
with that intensity because you didn't

6134.4 --> 6139.199
train it because you kept it all in so

6136.719 --> 6141.36
then if you it becomes too much

6139.199 --> 6143.44
ah you throw it out and yeah it's all

6141.36 --> 6144.799999999999
completely out of control and you i

6143.44 --> 6146.96
don't know you kill somebody or

6144.8 --> 6150.159000000001
something right

6146.96 --> 6152.08
or do terrible harm and then feel really

6150.159 --> 6153.28
terrible about it afterwards yeah it's

6152.08 --> 6156.32
because

6153.28 --> 6156.32
you didn't deal with it

6160.8 --> 6164.4800000000005
that's it's a good point davey z

6167.44 --> 6172.5199999999995
all right i'm going to take a two minute

6168.8 --> 6172.52
break i'll be right back

6260.639 --> 6262.96
yo

6379.199 --> 6383.199
that i talked about today

6381.28 --> 6387.4
talking about anger

6383.199 --> 6387.4
prejudice started with prejudice

6399.679 --> 6405.08
how am i gonna title this definitely

6401.679 --> 6405.08
needs a title

6416.0 --> 6427.199
[Music]

6425.04 --> 6430.159
yeah we will call it like this prejudice

6427.199 --> 6433.159
and anger are tools against the reversed

6430.159 --> 6433.159
world

6433.8 --> 6436.9890000000005
[Music]

6450.08 --> 6456.5599999999995
although i won that's not

6452.48 --> 6457.919999999999
maybe it's not entirely correct

6456.56 --> 6460.080000000001
it's just that

6457.92 --> 6461.1990000000005
to summarize whatever what are my

6460.08 --> 6463.28
statements

6461.199 --> 6465.839999999999
what my statements were about in one

6463.28 --> 6470.199
sentence is like it's too much

6465.84 --> 6470.1990000000005
why do i summarize this

6470.96 --> 6474.96
you think that's good did you see ned

6480.08 --> 6483.96
i guess i could do it

6491.52 --> 6497.119000000001
oh wait no no no no i get it prejudice

6494.08 --> 6497.119
anger and

6497.199 --> 6503.919999999999
other tools against the reversed world

6500.639 --> 6503.92
and now it's complete

6507.44 --> 6510.44
yes

6514.0 --> 6518.48

a fabulous

6532.48 --> 6537.119
australian protest chant

that's the early bird show every day

6546.639 --> 6552.400000000001
dude you didn't know

6549.119 --> 6555.469999999999
that you didn't pay attention

6552.4 --> 6558.6089999999995
because it's been every day

6555.47 --> 6558.609
[Music]

6559.04 --> 6563.599
yeah that's how you build

6561.159 --> 6567.638999999999
1285 shows

6563.599 --> 6567.639
you do it every day

6570.08 --> 6573.53
every day till

6572.159 --> 6574.96
i'm done

6573.53 --> 6576.4
[Music]

6574.96 --> 6579.599
i'm not saying it i'm going to do it

6576.4 --> 6579.598999999999
till i die or anything

6580.239 --> 6583.839999999999
but i'll do it as long as necessary

6590.239 --> 6595.08
or as long as i can hold out right

6598.239 --> 6602.159
support your local irwin indeed and

6600.239 --> 6604.718999999999
thank you alisji

6602.159 --> 6606.08
for for actually putting the deed by the

6604.719 --> 6610.28
word there

6606.08 --> 6610.28
i really appreciate that man

6650.32 --> 6657.199
huh

6653.04 --> 6657.199
all right davey z that's cool

6657.599 --> 6660.96
how long have you been following

6664.8 --> 6668.8
you gotta realize that i have very

6666.48 --> 6670.799999999999
little oversight as to how many people

6668.8 --> 6672.0
actually even know me

6670.8 --> 6674.2390000000005
it's

6672.0 --> 6676.0
it it appears to be more people than i

6674.239 --> 6678.4
expect though

6676.0 --> 6679.92
i do like when i visit other places i do

6678.4 --> 6682.32
get like people like hey i actually

6679.92 --> 6683.679
watch your show like what oh

6682.32 --> 6686.639
okay

6683.679 --> 6686.639
i hope you like it

6687.599 --> 6690.88
because

6688.56 --> 6692.56
from just doing the show and my chat i

6690.88 --> 6696.08
don't really get the impression that

6692.56 --> 6698.719
there's like vast amounts of people that

6696.08 --> 6701.599
actually watch me

6698.719 --> 6703.52
i mean i know everybody could watch me

6701.599 --> 6704.639
i just don't really get the feeling like

6703.52 --> 6706.400000000001
they do

6704.639 --> 6710.159000000001
but i guess that

6706.4 --> 6710.159
i underestimate it

6717.36 --> 6721.119
huh

6718.239 --> 6724.32
counting back to one no

6721.119 --> 6726.88
now that would be way too much

6724.32 --> 6728.639
dedication because that means like oh oh

6726.88 --> 6732.08
i'm gonna count back now that means i

6728.639 --> 6734.84
will have to do the show for at least

6732.08 --> 6738.0
three more years

6734.84 --> 6738.0
uh no

6738.159 --> 6740.96
it's too much

6747.119 --> 6751.5199999999995
i got a lot of different people on d

6749.119 --> 6755.679
live i do

6751.52 --> 6755.679
well but i don't really stream on d live

6756.159 --> 6761.04
but i guess that

6758.48 --> 6765.48
yeah a lot of people did kind of join

6761.04 --> 6765.48
when i did that week on d live

6768.639 --> 6773.36
i wonder sometimes is that because of oh

6771.52 --> 6776.56
it's our win i'm

6773.36 --> 6779.44
i'm cool my subjects are cool or if i'm

6776.56 --> 6782.080000000001
just on average more experienced at

6779.44 --> 6784.5599999999995
doing this i mean i have done this for

6782.08 --> 6787.199
like three and a half years or whatever

6784.56 --> 6789.52
every day show you get more experience

6787.199 --> 6792.638999999999
you get more skill you get more smooth

6789.52 --> 6794.56
and out because of that so that people

6792.639 --> 6796.400000000001
might be like oh well this guy at least

6794.56 --> 6798.639
knows sort of what he's doing compared

6796.4 --> 6800.5599999999995
to other people that are just awkward

6798.639 --> 6802.56
and numpty's and completely done on what

6800.56 --> 6803.52
the hell they're saying at times

6802.56 --> 6805.360000000001
right

6803.52 --> 6807.679
so compared to those

6805.36 --> 6808.719
super noobs out there which there are a

6807.679 --> 6811.599
lot of

6808.719 --> 6813.679
yeah i'd probably be more entertaining

6811.599 --> 6816.56
i don't know if that automatically

6813.679 --> 6818.84
implies that people really care about

6816.56 --> 6823.52
the things that i have to say

6818.84 --> 6823.52
but it at least it's something

6828.239 --> 6832.718999999999
i thought you would do

6830.4 --> 6834.719
shows for as long as there is yeah but i

6832.719 --> 6838.4800000000005
clutch i don't really anticipate that

6834.719 --> 6838.4800000000005
the internet's gonna go away though

6839.599 --> 6842.4800000000005
i mean

6840.719 --> 6845.4800000000005
that's gonna just break everything and

6842.48 --> 6845.48
then

6848.32 --> 6854.32
i mean serious

6851.44 --> 6857.919999999999
but this society cannot work without an

6854.32 --> 6859.92
internet it would be complete chaos

6857.92 --> 6861.52
very quickly

6859.92 --> 6863.84
right everything

6861.52 --> 6865.1990000000005
almost everything is dependent on the

6863.84 --> 6867.52
internet

6865.199 --> 6868.799999999999
can't just turn it off

6867.52 --> 6871.040000000001
it's that

6868.8 --> 6875.28
undoable

6871.04 --> 6877.679
so they're not going to just shut it off

6875.28 --> 6880.5599999999995
unless it's already to the soylent green

6877.679 --> 6882.719
stage it's like oh oh you're already

6880.56 --> 6885.52
locked in nowhere to go literally

6882.719 --> 6888.0
surrounded by military

6885.52 --> 6889.92
barricades everywhere yeah then they

6888.0 --> 6892.56
could just turn it off and say like okay

6889.92 --> 6894.719
well go [ __ ] yourself now just starve to

6892.56 --> 6896.320000000001
death

6894.719 --> 6899.04
unless you make your own food and then

6896.32 --> 6901.599
we'll see how long it lasts right

6899.04 --> 6903.84
but until that point it's not going to

6901.599 --> 6906.0
be turned off

6903.84 --> 6908.0
because everything is dependent on the

6906.0 --> 6910.719
internet to keep rolling

6908.0 --> 6910.719
at this point

6913.84 --> 6919.52
my show is more like a kaleidoscope

6916.96 --> 6923.76
than a microscope

6919.52 --> 6923.76
that's a really funny way to say that

6928.159 --> 6932.799999999999
that's where you first follow oh you did

6930.32 --> 6934.4
dave you found me 3d life oh okay i

6932.8 --> 6936.639
didn't know that

6934.4 --> 6936.638999999999
cool

6942.32 --> 6946.88
all right but yeah clutch i don't

6943.52 --> 6949.040000000001
anticipate losing the internet even like

6946.88 --> 6951.36
me personally losing the internet or the

6949.04 --> 6953.5199999999995
world losing it i don't anticipate that

6951.36 --> 6956.4
that will happen

6953.52 --> 6956.400000000001
anytime soon

6956.56 --> 6961.52
i mean

6957.92 --> 6963.119
the primary reason why i'd stop is

6961.52 --> 6965.360000000001
because i like

6963.119 --> 6966.08
i'm in very serious money trouble and

6965.36 --> 6969.598999999999
like

6966.08 --> 6970.96
simply can't continue like getting

6969.599 --> 6973.52
i don't think it's gonna happen though

6970.96 --> 6975.599
but like getting kicked out of my house

6973.52 --> 6979.119000000001
right then i'm not gonna be able to

6975.599 --> 6979.119000000001
stream it's very simple

6983.92 --> 6988.0
oh

6984.88 --> 6990.96
thank you for the super chat five roads

6988.0 --> 6994.96
keep helping people out shouldn't have

6990.96 --> 6997.28
been lied to it's good some people are

6994.96 --> 6999.92
trying to let us know the depths of the

6997.28 --> 7001.04
lies with concise real evidence to the

6999.92 --> 7003.84
truth

7001.04 --> 7003.84
indeed

7025.44 --> 7029.919999999999
yeah davies yeah that's so funny i was

7027.76 --> 7032.0
on like the main page for a while wasn't

7029.92 --> 7032.0
i

7032.56 --> 7037.360000000001
they did put me on the main page that

7034.08 --> 7037.36
was really weird to see that

7037.599 --> 7041.88
pretty cool though i am thankful

7049.76 --> 7056.08
yes psych where there's that too i mean

7052.56 --> 7056.080000000001
no internet no porn

7056.56 --> 7059.679
right

7058.96 --> 7060.56
or

7059.679 --> 7062.4800000000005
yeah

7060.56 --> 7064.400000000001
whatever they have left downloaded on

7062.48 --> 7068.48
their phone or something but yeah that's

7064.4 --> 7070.839999999999
not gonna suffice to the real addicts

7068.48 --> 7073.5199999999995
so yeah total

7070.84 --> 7077.119000000001
chaos it's going to be people that are

7073.52 --> 7080.4800000000005
basically being deprived of their squirt

7077.119 --> 7080.48
and they're going to go mental

7081.44 --> 7083.919999999999
and

7082.159 --> 7086.719
then we mean like

7083.92 --> 7089.04
not the resistors but mostly the people

7086.719 --> 7090.88
that are slave to the system they're the

7089.04 --> 7093.04
ones that are going to go berserk if the

7090.88 --> 7094.56
internet goes off

7093.04 --> 7096.32
because they're

7094.56 --> 7098.639
addicted to all the

7096.32 --> 7102.159
yeah the porn and all the nonsense and

7098.639 --> 7102.159000000001
whatever they do on the internet

7108.48 --> 7110.879999999999
right

7111.119 --> 7116.48
certainly they can't

7112.96 --> 7118.96
get connected with squirt dating

7116.48 --> 7118.959999999999
and all that

7127.04 --> 7131.44
so yeah i don't think that's gonna

7128.4 --> 7131.44
happen anytime soon

7137.679 --> 7142.32
at least not over here i mean i can't

7140.4 --> 7144.719
say the same for the united states i

7142.32 --> 7146.96
already announced yesterday that

7144.719 --> 7149.76
i'm expecting

7146.96 --> 7151.36
the united states to become soylent

7149.76 --> 7154.4800000000005
green world

7151.36 --> 7156.5599999999995
in about 10 years

7154.48 --> 7157.678999999999
and the already the leads are already

7156.56 --> 7159.52
there

7157.679 --> 7161.119
it's extremely dangerous yeah and when

7159.52 --> 7162.719
it gets to that point you might remember

7161.119 --> 7165.44
from silent green

7162.719 --> 7167.76
like all the cars are just like

7165.44 --> 7169.44
sitting everywhere there's no gasoline

7167.76 --> 7172.400000000001
anywhere

7169.44 --> 7173.759999999999
no food people are just like feeding on

7172.4 --> 7176.08
whenever they're being given like

7173.76 --> 7178.0
hamsters in a cage

7176.08 --> 7180.48
right they you bet your ass they don't

7178.0 --> 7183.84
have internet

7180.48 --> 7187.119
or at least not the regular folk

7183.84 --> 7187.119000000001
out there on the streets

7188.48 --> 7190.718999999999
so

7196.639 --> 7201.1990000000005
they need it for their smart grid yeah

7199.44 --> 7202.96
right

7201.199 --> 7205.119
but the thing is with the smart grid

7202.96 --> 7206.56
they only need it for as long as they

7205.119 --> 7211.199
are

7206.56 --> 7213.679
using the numpties to feed on right

7211.199 --> 7215.759999999999
i mean when it turns to soil in green

7213.679 --> 7218.08
like they do they don't care for the

7215.76 --> 7220.320000000001
smart like the smart grid is temporary

7218.08 --> 7222.719
you see it's the net

7220.32 --> 7224.719
well when all the numpties got trapped

7222.719 --> 7226.88
by the spider and they're all eaten

7224.719 --> 7228.719
being processed for organ harvesting or

7226.88 --> 7231.1990000000005
whatever the hell

7228.719 --> 7232.4800000000005
they're being used for

7231.199 --> 7234.5599999999995
they're all gone

7232.48 --> 7236.32
well then they don't need the smart grid

7234.56 --> 7239.280000000001
anymore because there's only going to be

7236.32 --> 7241.599
people left that don't use that

7239.28 --> 7243.199
so then they just might as well turn it

7241.599 --> 7245.84
off because it doesn't matter anymore

7243.199 --> 7248.48
but that would be more like a

7245.84 --> 7251.04
a warfare tactic at that point right

7248.48 --> 7255.4
just cut off all communication

7251.04 --> 7255.4
that's what it effectively would be

7267.119 --> 7270.799999999999
society

7268.96 --> 7272.08
no

7270.8 --> 7273.04
no they're not

7272.08 --> 7274.8
no

7273.04 --> 7277.8
no lord is not gonna turn off the

7274.8 --> 7277.8
internet

7284.88 --> 7289.52
the only way i foresee internet being

7287.44 --> 7291.28
turned off is going to be used for is

7289.52 --> 7293.92
for

7291.28 --> 7293.92
warfare

7294.96 --> 7299.76
like

7296.96 --> 7302.2390000000005
warfare from the inside like well what

7299.76 --> 7304.639
do you got in america there

7302.239 --> 7307.919999999999
yeah the government there is basically

7304.639 --> 7308.96
waging war on its population blatantly

7307.92 --> 7310.32
well then

7308.96 --> 7312.56
when you're in that position as a

7310.32 --> 7315.119
government then turning off the internet

7312.56 --> 7317.119000000001
is an effective siege tool on your own

7315.119 --> 7318.5599999999995
population

7317.119 --> 7319.92
right

7318.56 --> 7322.84
so that's

7319.92 --> 7324.4
how i see it getting employed not

7322.84 --> 7326.56
universally

7324.4 --> 7327.92
it's not gonna be everywhere that's only

7326.56 --> 7329.76
gonna be

7327.92 --> 7332.96
regions

7329.76 --> 7335.280000000001
if they do it everywhere in the world

7332.96 --> 7337.28
then the entire world goes to [ __ ] and

7335.28 --> 7339.5199999999995
they lose their grip they lose

7337.28 --> 7341.679
everything you see

7339.52 --> 7345.119000000001
this is not going to happen like that

7341.679 --> 7348.119
that's a very silly ill thought through

7345.119 --> 7348.119
myth

7357.84 --> 7362.32
internet was designed but you know you

7359.76 --> 7364.4800000000005
can't just shut it yeah but no you can

7362.32 --> 7366.239
though you can't do it with a single

7364.48 --> 7368.4
switch bobby steel

7366.239 --> 7370.32
but there's like

7368.4 --> 7373.119
network cables

7370.32 --> 7375.84
you can literally just cut them off

7373.119 --> 7378.32
so yeah you can actually turn off the

7375.84 --> 7378.32
internet

7378.8 --> 7382.400000000001
just got to go at the roots

7383.04 --> 7388.159
and then there's no more internet

7385.36 --> 7390.48
so those towers and all the wireless

7388.159 --> 7392.638999999999
[ __ ] it still all connects to those

7390.48 --> 7393.598999999999
massive cables

7392.639 --> 7396.159000000001
so

7393.599 --> 7400.0
there is a way to cut off the internet

7396.159 --> 7400.0
from entire regions there is

7407.36 --> 7411.36
and no power that's true if you have no

7409.44 --> 7414.0
power there's no internet right it's the

7411.36 --> 7414.0
same problem

7416.56 --> 7421.0
a

7417.599 --> 7421.0
similar problem

7433.76 --> 7438.2390000000005
right so i don't expect entire

7436.56 --> 7441.280000000001
the world to be

7438.239 --> 7443.5199999999995
internet shut down

7441.28 --> 7445.599
there might be regions that may be

7443.52 --> 7447.52
besieged by their own government by

7445.599 --> 7448.8
turning off their internet that might be

7447.52 --> 7450.4800000000005
one thing

7448.8 --> 7453.119000000001
and then of course there's more like the

7450.48 --> 7455.36
social credit score system

7453.119 --> 7458.079
like they employ in china

7455.36 --> 7458.88
where they might simply just say okay

7458.079 --> 7461.84
you

7458.88 --> 7465.28
your internet identity is now erased so

7461.84 --> 7467.1990000000005
you literally can't get on the internet

7465.28 --> 7470.96
anymore right

7467.199 --> 7474.079
more personal targeted cut off yeah

7470.96 --> 7474.079
that might come

7475.84 --> 7479.4400000000005
right i don't know i really hope it

7478.48 --> 7482.32
won't

7479.44 --> 7484.96
that would be a terrible time

7482.32 --> 7486.88
it would literally be like a full-blown

7484.96 --> 7489.599
communist revolution

7486.88 --> 7493.28
mao style or whatever

7489.599 --> 7496.88
that happens in the west

7493.28 --> 7499.36
but that is another way it could happen

7496.88 --> 7500.639
just personally getting cut off from the

7499.36 --> 7503.119
internet

7500.639 --> 7505.599
because now the internet is like an

7503.119 --> 7507.679
internet too whatever and you can only

7505.599 --> 7510.079
come on with an approved identity it

7507.679 --> 7512.88
would be full-blown communism basically

7510.079 --> 7512.88
if that happens

7514.719 --> 7520.719
no george sanford the sun is not a

7518.079 --> 7524.4
physical object

7520.719 --> 7528.199
so emp coming from the sun that's a myth

7524.4 --> 7528.199
it's all myth

7534.719 --> 7538.32
yeah that's right bobby stills china is

7536.48 --> 7541.5599999999995
doing that to taiwan

7538.32 --> 7541.5599999999995
that's right

7554.079 --> 7560.92
except it's already been made up before

7557.119 --> 7560.92
i know george sanford

7596.159 --> 7600.079
okay

7597.199 --> 7602.4
so uh yeah georgetown why did you show

7600.079 --> 7604.96
me historically

7602.4 --> 7606.239
when and where did that happen where

7604.96 --> 7607.84
when did the

7606.239 --> 7610.239
sun

7607.84 --> 7612.159000000001
cause an emp

7610.239 --> 7615.879999999999
when's the last time that's officially

7612.159 --> 7615.879999999999
happened and where

7620.639 --> 7623.599
right

7621.679 --> 7626.56
have you ever thought that maybe it

7623.599 --> 7628.360000000001
wasn't actually the sun

7626.56 --> 7630.88
maybe it was just

7628.36 --> 7633.36
technological issues

7630.88 --> 7634.96
and then they made up an excuse that the

7633.36 --> 7639.48
sun caused it

7634.96 --> 7639.4800000000005
so that they wouldn't get the blame

7641.06 --> 7644.129000000001
[Music]

7650.719 --> 7656.4
all right so canada northern states

7654.56 --> 7658.4800000000005
that's cool

7656.4 --> 7661.839999999999
so if the sun

7658.48 --> 7661.839999999999
did it then

7662.239 --> 7667.04
then why were

7664.56 --> 7668.400000000001
the southern states

7667.04 --> 7670.639
europe

7668.4 --> 7672.5599999999995
russia

7670.639 --> 7676.400000000001
the other regions why weren't they

7672.56 --> 7676.400000000001
affected then george sanford

7676.88 --> 7682.4800000000005
ever considered that maybe it wasn't the

7679.76 --> 7685.4800000000005
sun that did that that's just a cover

7682.48 --> 7685.48
story

7695.04 --> 7701.4
satellites low

7698.4 --> 7701.4
and

7708.079 --> 7712.079
look i think that there might be one

7710.0 --> 7714.079
thing that the sun could do right it is

7712.079 --> 7716.4
still energy coming

7714.079 --> 7717.5199999999995
towards us arriving through the sun's

7716.4 --> 7719.598999999999
presence

7717.52 --> 7722.639
and then maybe

7719.599 --> 7724.8
since it is light and it is kind of like

7722.639 --> 7727.04
there is this weird interaction

7724.8 --> 7730.320000000001
polarization and i'm not an electronic

7727.04 --> 7731.5199999999995
expert but yeah sun might like overload

7730.32 --> 7734.0
a grid

7731.52 --> 7736.079000000001
for example if the grid is not properly

7734.0 --> 7738.32
attuned

7736.079 --> 7738.32
right

7738.639 --> 7744.719
something like that

7741.28 --> 7747.759999999999
but again that's more about

7744.719 --> 7751.36
the electronics it's more about the grid

7747.76 --> 7751.360000000001
how well has it been maintained

7751.84 --> 7755.92
is it doing right is it not being

7753.44 --> 7758.239
overloaded with like

7755.92 --> 7762.2390000000005
too much electricity demand and little

7758.239 --> 7764.799999999999
production etc i don't know it's just

7762.239 --> 7767.44
i am going to assume that it is a

7764.8 --> 7770.4800000000005
technological fault and not the sun

7767.44 --> 7770.48
doing an emp

7771.28 --> 7774.88
right

7772.48 --> 7777.759999999999
because yeah the sun does

7774.88 --> 7780.4800000000005
apparently have an influence on like the

7777.76 --> 7782.8
electric grid or whatever with the light

7780.48 --> 7784.159
hitting the wires or however that works

7782.8 --> 7786.96
ask a

7784.159 --> 7789.119
like an electronic expert about such

7786.96 --> 7791.119
things i don't know the details i know

7789.119 --> 7793.199
there is an influence from the sun on

7791.119 --> 7796.639
electric systems

7793.199 --> 7799.119
that doesn't mean an emp like

7796.639 --> 7802.159000000001
everything is gone and roasted

7799.119 --> 7802.159
uh no

7803.28 --> 7809.84
that seems more like a man-made device

7806.159 --> 7812.0
or like a technological hazard

7809.84 --> 7813.52
something haphazard

7812.0 --> 7814.88
something went wrong

7813.52 --> 7817.040000000001
right

7814.88 --> 7819.679
i don't think that's the sun like that

7817.04 --> 7822.679
seems like another heliocentric cover

7819.679 --> 7822.679
story

7830.56 --> 7833.599
i love to do that

7835.36 --> 7840.839999999999
right attribute all these

7838.159 --> 7842.5599999999995
things and abilities

7840.84 --> 7846.639
to

7842.56 --> 7848.320000000001
that giant heliocentric ball of fire sun

7846.639 --> 7849.679
that they think it is so that you can

7848.32 --> 7851.679
think about that

7849.679 --> 7854.96
about all these things that it's doing

7851.679 --> 7858.719
and it's so big and oh

7854.96 --> 7860.8
well it's not even an object it's just a

7858.719 --> 7863.199
manifesting light

7860.8 --> 7866.0
a non-local hologram

7863.199 --> 7868.879999999999
which manifests light a lot of it

7866.0 --> 7871.84
and energy and electric energy somehow

7868.88 --> 7871.84
so

7883.599 --> 7887.679
are they trying to push electric cars in

7885.44 --> 7890.079
the net dude that's already fully

7887.679 --> 7891.76
happened

7890.079 --> 7894.759999999999
there's a lot of electric cars here

7891.76 --> 7894.76
unfortunately

7923.36 --> 7927.5199999999995
ah i thought so mike's doing it yeah

7925.44 --> 7928.719
overload of the grid

7927.52 --> 7931.84
that's right

7928.719 --> 7933.04
oh no it's it's the sun the sun sent an

7931.84 --> 7936.0
emp

7933.04 --> 7938.8
it's like sun just nukes us sometimes

7936.0 --> 7942.32
and then oh it's the sun dated to us oh

7938.8 --> 7945.28
it wasn't our incompetent maintenance no

7942.32 --> 7946.4
it was the sun yes

7945.28 --> 7948.079
yes

7946.4 --> 7952.44
it's the sun

7948.079 --> 7952.44
that's what it sounds like to me

7976.8 --> 7983.84
yes pgcnet yeah no electric cars are not

7980.159 --> 7983.839999999999
good for the environment at all

7985.28 --> 7990.32
they cost a lot more energy they're very

7988.159 --> 7994.598999999999
energy inefficient and they drain the

7990.32 --> 7994.599
electric net a lot

7999.199 --> 8003.199
the only

8000.639 --> 8005.1990000000005
advantage is that there is no fumes

8003.199 --> 8007.919999999999
coming out of them that's like the only

8005.199 --> 8010.799999999999
positive thing

8007.92 --> 8013.599
but other than that yeah it is very

8010.8 --> 8013.599
energy draining

8015.44 --> 8022.32
i mean i'm much more of a proponent of

8018.32 --> 8025.44
just hyper efficient gasoline engines

8022.32 --> 8028.239
where it's so refined

8025.44 --> 8030.5599999999995
how it all works that only well just

8028.239 --> 8034.799999999999
like with the hyper

8030.56 --> 8036.159000000001
modern coal plants only moist and co2

8034.8 --> 8039.719
comes out

8036.159 --> 8039.719
and then it's perfect

8040.4 --> 8043.759999999999
right

8041.52 --> 8046.92
so yeah electric cars are just a waste

8043.76 --> 8046.92
of time

8055.44 --> 8060.4
do you believe there's free energy

8057.679 --> 8060.4
not really

8065.44 --> 8069.919999999999
but i do think that energy can be a lot

8068.159 --> 8072.96
more efficient than we are made to

8069.92 --> 8075.28
believe it is

8072.96 --> 8075.28
right

8076.0 --> 8081.04
i think there is a heavy abundance of

8078.56 --> 8083.4400000000005
energy that we can utilize very

8081.04 --> 8086.239
efficiently that's what i believe

8083.44 --> 8086.239
in abundance

8087.679 --> 8095.32
and we're being set up to waste it

8091.76 --> 8095.320000000001
that's what's happening

8095.36 --> 8099.13
[Music]

8120.159 --> 8125.5199999999995
what do i think about tartaria well

8122.32 --> 8125.5199999999995
what's there to think about

8128.719 --> 8134.4800000000005
i think tartaria is

8131.199 --> 8138.96
pieces of cut out history that didn't

8134.48 --> 8138.959999999999
fit the the modern narrative story

8139.199 --> 8143.839999999999
right tartaria is just one of these

8141.28 --> 8146.32
things that have been just

8143.84 --> 8148.56
scrapped out of the

8146.32 --> 8150.719
official narrative

8148.56 --> 8153.360000000001
that's what i think of it

8150.719 --> 8155.599
and does that mean it was everything

8153.36 --> 8158.799999999999
is all this giant thing it was like a

8155.599 --> 8162.92
new atlantis i don't know man i really

8158.8 --> 8162.92
don't know enough about it

8167.04 --> 8172.159
i mean it could have been

8170.0 --> 8172.159
but

8175.679 --> 8182.4800000000005
yeah i don't know maybe there is still

8179.199 --> 8185.759999999999
just like a cr a clean

8182.48 --> 8188.079
record history book where it is like

8185.76 --> 8190.079000000001
completely non-propaganda it's like pure

8188.079 --> 8192.16
historical recording

8190.079 --> 8194.24
of everything of the tartarian empire

8192.16 --> 8196.08
that would be amazing if there's such a

8194.24 --> 8199.039999999999
book

8196.08 --> 8201.359
it would probably be in the vatican if

8199.04 --> 8204.679
anywhere

8201.359 --> 8204.679
in the vault

8204.99 --> 8208.11
[Music]

8236.88 --> 8240.719
what

8239.2 --> 8243.439
you talking about

8240.719 --> 8243.438999999998
gaining wisdom

8243.92 --> 8247.12
why do you think they cut it out of our

8245.359 --> 8249.28
history books

8247.12 --> 8252.399000000001
because it didn't fit the

8249.28 --> 8254.479000000001
the narratives that were grafted in

8252.399 --> 8257.439
right when you make up cover stories for

8254.479 --> 8260.559
what happened in the past

8257.439 --> 8262.319
you have to build that up

8260.559 --> 8263.119999999999
and then yeah those cover stories are

8262.319 --> 8265.679
not

8263.12 --> 8267.679
very likely to not match everything

8265.679 --> 8269.76
right and if there is like a prominent

8267.679 --> 8272.399
empire that's really doing something

8269.76 --> 8275.12
rising up compared to others

8272.399 --> 8277.199999999999
that's not gonna be compatible they're

8275.12 --> 8279.439
not going to rewrite their entire story

8277.2 --> 8281.439
around that happening they're just not

8279.439 --> 8284.479000000001
going to do it so they just chose like

8281.439 --> 8285.28
that doesn't exist anymore

8284.479 --> 8288.559
it's

8285.28 --> 8292.639000000001
in the way there's not supposed to be

8288.559 --> 8294.88
an empire separated like that

8292.639 --> 8295.839999999998
because of the way the history is

8294.88 --> 8298.08
written

8295.84 --> 8301.12
because of the way they want you to

8298.08 --> 8303.28
think everything develop

8301.12 --> 8305.84
so they just scrapped it out that's what

8303.28 --> 8305.84
i think happened

8327.2 --> 8332.08
yeah wood [ __ ] gummy bear you do

8329.92 --> 8334.0
