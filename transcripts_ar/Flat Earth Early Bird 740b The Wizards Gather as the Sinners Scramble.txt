4.48 --> 10.639
and

5.359 --> 13.92
welcome back i hope

10.639 --> 18.799999999999997
yes it seems like finally

13.92 --> 20.48
it's yeah it's finally caught on

18.8 --> 24.8
i tried to restart as quickly as

20.48 --> 24.8
possible but somehow did not connect

34.32 --> 40.96
[Music]

36.0 --> 40.96
so i'm just gonna continue this show

42.32 --> 46.64
for another half hour before i round it

44.64 --> 49.36
out

46.64 --> 50.0
because yeah my computer just crashed

49.36 --> 52.079
just

50.0 --> 53.28
just blue screen just like that didn't

52.079 --> 58.96
know where that came from

53.28 --> 62.32
very weird but i'm back

58.96 --> 62.32
and yeah

63.44 --> 68.15899999999999
right good to see you good to see you

66.4 --> 71.92
back

68.159 --> 74.0
so again my computer just crashed i

71.92 --> 75.43900000000001
tried to restart back as quick up

74.0 --> 77.92
quickly as possible was

75.439 --> 78.55999999999999
pretty quick at restart then tried to

77.92 --> 80.799
like

78.56 --> 82.479
like immediately open obs and continue

80.799 --> 86.72000000000001
but unfortunately it did not

82.479 --> 91.2
accept it so yeah this is

86.72 --> 91.2
the last quarter of the show

93.439 --> 101.83999999999999
as a b added on to it

97.52 --> 101.84
but yeah that was weird

102.56 --> 107.84
abraham guns have never run nasty

105.6 --> 109.03999999999999
youtube police no no no youtube police

107.84 --> 110.88000000000001
has nothing to do with

109.04 --> 112.32000000000001
my computer suddenly crashing guns have

110.88 --> 115.83999999999999
never run rmp

112.32 --> 115.83999999999999
that's ridiculous

118.64 --> 121.92
although i agree they can be very

120.56 --> 126.84
annoying

121.92 --> 129.84
at times it seemed to leave me alone

126.84 --> 129.84
though

136.959 --> 139.28
right

140.72 --> 145.92
so yeah i kind of lost my train of

142.879 --> 145.92
thought because this

146.879 --> 152.239
i think i was talking to a kumu virus

148.72 --> 152.239
but it was getting annoying

154.08 --> 160.31900000000002
buffering that's your side then it's not

157.36 --> 171.36
buffering over here

160.319 --> 174.959
everything should be fine

171.36 --> 178.239
right so yeah uh

174.959 --> 178.239
what were we talking about

180.4 --> 185.84
i think i was addressing eugenics the

182.48 --> 185.84
eugenics cult and all that

188.239 --> 193.44
and how they will try to think up any

191.519 --> 196.239
amount of stories just

193.44 --> 198.0
anything to somehow convince us that we

196.239 --> 201.28
should all be exterminated and that's

198.0 --> 204.159
okay is that that's what it is

201.28 --> 205.44
all of it it's the only thing it is it's

204.159 --> 208.48
literal just

205.44 --> 210.48
satan or ariman taking

208.48 --> 212.56
making people obsessed with trying to

210.48 --> 214.23899999999998
find a way to basically exterminate

212.56 --> 216.879
everybody

214.239 --> 218.48000000000002
and then some may be idealist and

216.879 --> 220.48
actually think that well but

218.48 --> 223.04
it's better for the world and that way

220.48 --> 224.79899999999998
there's less people and we can enjoy

223.04 --> 225.519
everything more yeah that's a nice pipe

224.799 --> 227.68
dream because

225.519 --> 228.72
everything will fall everything will be

227.68 --> 230.56
destroyed everything

228.72 --> 232.319
you're now taking for granted it will

230.56 --> 233.599
all go away everything there will be

232.319 --> 236.07999999999998
nothing left

233.599 --> 236.79899999999998
yeah you might store a lot of [ __ ] guess

236.08 --> 238.87900000000002
what

236.799 --> 241.36
it's all gonna go to [ __ ] because

238.879 --> 242.239
there's nobody left to repair it or to

241.36 --> 245.12
update it

242.239 --> 247.28
or to build a new one or to figure out

245.12 --> 248.48000000000002
that there's an inherent flaw built into

247.28 --> 250.64000000000001
the process

248.48 --> 251.599
and there's nobody to left to correct it

250.64 --> 254.79899999999998
it'll just

251.599 --> 257.12
all be destroyed

254.799 --> 259.6
all of it every piece of technology

257.12 --> 262.479
anything everything high-tech

259.6 --> 263.44
computers cannot be made to repair

262.479 --> 265.44
themselves

263.44 --> 266.84
and build everything it's impossible

265.44 --> 270.8
they will always

266.84 --> 273.28
require humans every single time

270.8 --> 276.72
humans to update it humans to repair it

273.28 --> 279.75899999999996
humans to foresee the flaws

276.72 --> 280.88000000000005
because computers cannot that's a pipe

279.759 --> 284.08000000000004
dream

280.88 --> 285.44
it's just a lie it was a lie from the

284.08 --> 288.88
beginning

285.44 --> 288.88
it will always be a lie

290.08 --> 297.52
computers can never exist independently

294.32 --> 299.919
from human beings ever never ever

297.52 --> 300.56
it's always going to be that order

299.919 --> 303.59999999999997
humans

300.56 --> 305.199
computers humans computers never just

303.6 --> 307.759
computers it's impossible

305.199 --> 308.84000000000003
it'll never happen ever no matter how

307.759 --> 311.68
much time

308.84 --> 314.63899999999995
passes no matter how much

311.68 --> 314.639
it's never going to happen

319.759 --> 324.0
yeah what jack ma jack ma i don't know

323.6 --> 327.84000000000003
who that

324.0 --> 327.84
is who is that tara 306

332.479 --> 339.84
elon musk was pissed off well go [ __ ]

334.72 --> 339.84000000000003
him he's a [ __ ]

339.919 --> 345.19899999999996
alibaba all right well smart cookie i'd

342.96 --> 345.19899999999996
say

345.28 --> 348.88
you would have to be if you're like

347.24 --> 351.919
multi-billion dollar

348.88 --> 354.24
mega corporation owner although yeah

351.919 --> 356.15999999999997
elon musk is supposedly that too right

354.24 --> 358.40000000000003
but he's a bumbling buffoon

356.16 --> 358.40000000000003
so

360.319 --> 367.44
founder jack ma is dumb as a stone okay

364.72 --> 368.47900000000004
well then he got a good message i guess

367.44 --> 371.039
that he thought he would

368.479 --> 373.28
convey i don't know if he's smart or not

371.039 --> 376.08
dude i don't know

373.28 --> 377.44
but if he said that what i just said

376.08 --> 393.919
then he's

377.44 --> 394.8
smart enough to realize that at least

393.919 --> 398.0
okay

394.8 --> 401.039
i i don't really care 306 there

398.0 --> 403.96
i i don't watch any of that [ __ ]

401.039 --> 405.759
i don't i really don't care about these

403.96 --> 408.4
conversations

405.759 --> 408.96000000000004
between these mega corporation owners at

408.4 --> 411.19899999999996
all

408.96 --> 412.88
it's just a squirt off it's just

411.199 --> 416.0
propaganda [ __ ]

412.88 --> 418.15999999999997
to promote things usually anyway

416.0 --> 420.08
as people can't have genuine

418.16 --> 423.36
conversations anymore

420.08 --> 425.68
it's impossible for them

423.36 --> 426.40000000000003
and don't watch when i don't watch them

425.68 --> 430.24
they're stupid

426.4 --> 432.79999999999995
right they are it's just pr [ __ ]

430.24 --> 433.52
every single time always pr [ __ ]

432.8 --> 436.8
there's nothing

433.52 --> 438.71999999999997
interesting coming from them too much

436.8 --> 441.28000000000003
money will literally just

438.72 --> 442.24
destroy the spirit capability to be

441.28 --> 444.479
genuine

442.24 --> 446.0
and interesting it just destroys it the

444.479 --> 450.479
only thing that's left is money

446.0 --> 452.8
only thing is left is that

450.479 --> 465.15999999999997
there's just no more sensibility left

452.8 --> 468.349
for anything else

465.16 --> 468.34900000000005
[Music]

473.199 --> 481.599
all right i got 19 back watching good

478.0 --> 481.599
still have another 20 minutes to go

486.8 --> 493.84000000000003
all right

499.599 --> 502.8
all right i'd like to remind everybody

501.759 --> 506.08000000000004
that

502.8 --> 509.199
i'm still kind of like saving up

506.08 --> 510.479
for computer things and still in the

509.199 --> 512.8000000000001
process that it's like

510.479 --> 515.76
i guess that if nathan would be doing

512.8 --> 518.0799999999999
that he would make a go fund me and then

515.76 --> 519.36
but i'm basically scrambling for

518.08 --> 521.36
electronic parts

519.36 --> 522.9590000000001
now my computer crashed this is another

521.36 --> 524.8000000000001
sign right

522.959 --> 527.68
it literally crashed right in the show

524.8 --> 527.68
very bizarre

527.76 --> 531.279
i don't think it's anything to really

529.68 --> 533.04
worry about but it's really bizarre that

531.279 --> 536.72
it happened

533.04 --> 539.8389999999999
and yeah if you can please

536.72 --> 541.36
help finance me through the paypal

539.839 --> 546.0
especially

541.36 --> 548.64
and now on the same note

546.0 --> 549.12
compared to say like the last year or

548.64 --> 551.68
two

549.12 --> 552.72
when i have had paypal donations and

551.68 --> 556.3199999999999
help from people

552.72 --> 557.76
in chat i've been

556.32 --> 559.6800000000001
yeah in that in all that period i've

557.76 --> 560.48
been drinking and i've been smoking a

559.68 --> 562.88
lot of weed

560.48 --> 564.8000000000001
well a lot yeah i guess a lot for the

562.88 --> 567.6
average person well since i got sick

564.8 --> 569.68
i completely stopped drinking completely

567.6 --> 573.12
i'm not gonna do that again

569.68 --> 576.2399999999999
for a long time to come at least and i

573.12 --> 579.279
smoke probably a third

576.24 --> 581.12
or a quarter of what i did before like i

579.279 --> 581.8389999999999
don't even smoking before the show

581.12 --> 584.64
anymore

581.839 --> 586.5600000000001
i'm completely sober every time now

584.64 --> 588.3199999999999
because it's better i like it more

586.56 --> 591.3599999999999
it's only in the evening where i start

588.32 --> 594.5600000000001
to smoke a joint eventually

591.36 --> 595.2
right so that's costing a lot less money

594.56 --> 597.5999999999999
so

595.2 --> 598.88
i'd also like to tell you if you're

597.6 --> 603.6
going to donate

598.88 --> 607.2
to me it's also just

603.6 --> 610.24
not going to be yeah

607.2 --> 613.2
going on that specific pile anymore

610.24 --> 614.0790000000001
so i have more room to actually invest

613.2 --> 617.2
in

614.079 --> 618.079
things like hey a new hard disk or a new

617.2 --> 621.36
ssd

618.079 --> 625.68
that i bought last time and

621.36 --> 628.64
i just ordered a new a new

625.68 --> 630.399
new head pair of headphones that i

628.64 --> 632.88
really need because the old one is just

630.399 --> 636.079
literally falling apart

632.88 --> 638.16
and there's more of these things i also

636.079 --> 640.399
kind of need a new fan or a new

638.16 --> 642.8
secondhand fan for my computer because

640.399 --> 645.6
that might be the contributing factor to

642.8 --> 647.04
why my computer keeps blue screen ever

645.6 --> 650.0
since that fan

647.04 --> 650.0
kind of started going

650.079 --> 653.279
this super annoying i turned it off

652.24 --> 656.72
because it was just

653.279 --> 657.76
breaking my head but ever since i

656.72 --> 660.5600000000001
started doing that

657.76 --> 662.88
my computer has started to like get into

660.56 --> 666.079
weird blue screen crashes

662.88 --> 667.8389999999999
so i do want to replace it right

666.079 --> 671.5999999999999
so please do support me through the

667.839 --> 675.839
paypal and hey guns have never run rmp

671.6 --> 675.839

678.56 --> 687.1999999999999

i will have the headphones and maybe

732.48 --> 736.72
it'll be after the show

734.56 --> 739.04
and that would mean that i have my

736.72 --> 741.9200000000001
headphones to show

739.04 --> 741.92
on thursday

743.12 --> 746.399
i really can't wait because i just want

745.279 --> 749.519
good headphones

746.399 --> 750.56
and then preferably with a long cord

749.519 --> 753.36
because these

750.56 --> 754.0
headphones just the cord is not even a

753.36 --> 756.48
meter

754.0 --> 758.079
it's way too short i want some good

756.48 --> 760.16
headphones so i can literally

758.079 --> 761.5999999999999
listen to music and potentially move

760.16 --> 763.36
around

761.6 --> 765.6800000000001
because the music's so good i can't sit

763.36 --> 768.639
still

765.68 --> 770.0
i can't wait for that and hopefully that

768.639 --> 773.279
pair of headphones gonna last

770.0 --> 775.2
very long time it should

773.279 --> 778.16
it had some good reviews even though

775.2 --> 778.1600000000001
it's relatively new

778.399 --> 785.6

842.88 --> 858.48
wait until this show is over has oberko

857.12 --> 861.68
returned

858.48 --> 863.6800000000001
yeah that's weird i have not seen him

861.68 --> 865.04
or her i don't know if it's him or her i

863.68 --> 870.079
have not seen him for

865.04 --> 873.279
some time it is weird

870.079 --> 875.12
i don't know i don't know why and

873.279 --> 878.399
why he's never showing up anymore in the

875.12 --> 878.399
chat i do kind of miss him

879.519 --> 883.6
but yeah i just disappeared and then

882.56 --> 886.079
after that

883.6 --> 886.88
it's just yeah i haven't seen him around

886.079 --> 890.0
anywhere

886.88 --> 890.0
i don't know what he's doing

890.32 --> 894.0790000000001
maybe he maybe he just really needed a

893.279 --> 896.8389999999999
big break

894.079 --> 898.959
from the entire youtube thing or

896.839 --> 901.36
something

898.959 --> 904.0
you know i don't know but i sure hope

901.36 --> 904.0
he's all right

907.12 --> 914.48
the wrench issue maybe maybe

912.639 --> 916.48
but is that really a reason to never

914.48 --> 919.1990000000001
come back again

916.48 --> 919.1990000000001
it's just weird

920.72 --> 929.279
hi jason

927.12 --> 931.279
because i'd probably give him his ranch

929.279 --> 934.079
back too you know it's just that

931.279 --> 935.279
in that moment it was just a really bad

934.079 --> 938.7199999999999
mistake

935.279 --> 938.72
because of the implications and

938.839 --> 944.8800000000001
everything

941.6 --> 944.88
but yeah it was a mistake

946.959 --> 952.56
no but feelings get hurt could be

950.16 --> 953.199
i'm sorry if i hurt his feelings it's

952.56 --> 955.4399999999999
just i

953.199 --> 957.3599999999999
it did really piss me off that he did

955.44 --> 960.639
that though

957.36 --> 962.72
but hey i do understand he didn't do it

960.639 --> 964.16
on pro he even said like oh it was some

962.72 --> 969.6800000000001
kind of timing issue

964.16 --> 971.36
like he he lagged or something

969.68 --> 973.68
and that's understandable it can happen

971.36 --> 983.04
it's just the worst timing ever

973.68 --> 987.199
that's all

983.04 --> 991.12
yes that that me too tiny mumble i do

987.199 --> 991.12
that's why it was so shocking to me

994.839 --> 997.839
see

1001.839 --> 1009.6
but i don't know i hope i hope he's not

1005.199 --> 1010.079
like like going hari kiri or something

1009.6 --> 1011.9200000000001
you know

1010.079 --> 1013.8389999999999
over that that that would be kind of a

1011.92 --> 1015.8389999999999
waste because he's still

1013.839 --> 1018.1600000000001
very much welcome it was just a moment

1015.839 --> 1020.5600000000001
where i just got really pissed off

1018.16 --> 1022.8
because it was unbelievably inconvenient

1020.56 --> 1026.24
that little mistake

1022.8 --> 1030.319
but yeah i'd give him his wrench back

1026.24 --> 1033.52
if he came back no it's it's kind of

1030.319 --> 1036.1599999999999
it happens yeah

1033.52 --> 1038.0
people get over those things i get over

1036.16 --> 1040.16
it and i hope that he can get over

1038.0 --> 1043.28
it too because he is very much welcome

1040.16 --> 1046.0
he's like one of my longest followers

1043.28 --> 1047.36
and i know he's a very good guy i think

1046.0 --> 1050.4
it's a he

1047.36 --> 1052.4799999999998
probably yeah but so yeah

1050.4 --> 1054.72
um if you're seeing this please come

1052.48 --> 1055.3600000000001
back don't worry you are still very

1054.72 --> 1058.559
welcome

1055.36 --> 1061.039
it's just that yeah you really

1058.559 --> 1062.32
like stepped on my toe in a very painful

1061.039 --> 1064.08
way in that moment

1062.32 --> 1066.72
but i know it was a mistake you already

1064.08 --> 1070.48
confessed that even then i just got

1066.72 --> 1070.48
really pissed off for a moment

1071.52 --> 1081.84
right exactly tiny mumble

1086.4 --> 1090.96
right but then again maybe he just used

1090.0 --> 1094.48
that moment

1090.96 --> 1096.72
that snap to step away from youtube for

1094.48 --> 1098.88
a while because it was all getting a bit

1096.72 --> 1101.84
burdensome on him you know it is kind of

1098.88 --> 1105.919
the time of the year where people

1101.84 --> 1109.28
where things get too much for them

1105.919 --> 1112.3200000000002

1260.84 --> 1263.84
hungry

1274.84 --> 1277.84
uh

1347.35 --> 1350.54
[Music]

1358.08 --> 1361.84
a second

1364.559 --> 1371.2
yeah talking about history by the way

1367.679 --> 1375.2800000000002
robin stanley who was in chat earlier

1371.2 --> 1378.96
like she i don't know if i should

1375.28 --> 1382.3999999999999
reveal all that i could probably can

1378.96 --> 1386.24
like she's got this amazing

1382.4 --> 1388.799
momentum now in her old hometown

1386.24 --> 1390.88
where she's basically now being handed

1388.799 --> 1393.52
the reigns

1390.88 --> 1395.5200000000002
over the historical museum like the

1393.52 --> 1397.039
local historical museums like she's

1395.52 --> 1399.679
getting

1397.039 --> 1400.799
she's getting control like she can now

1399.679 --> 1403.3600000000001
decide

1400.799 --> 1404.6399999999999
what is going to happen with it like

1403.36 --> 1406.9599999999998
what projects they are going to

1404.64 --> 1410.7990000000002
undertake it's pretty incredible

1406.96 --> 1412.88
because before it was all cocked sjw

1410.799 --> 1415.36
[ __ ] and like they would like oh we're

1412.88 --> 1418.72
going to do a black history month

1415.36 --> 1419.9189999999999
when like they don't have any history

1418.72 --> 1421.84
there

1419.919 --> 1422.96
like the first black person came there

1421.84 --> 1426.0
even like the late

1422.96 --> 1426.96
19th century there's literally no

1426.0 --> 1429.039
history of that

1426.96 --> 1431.039
at all like they weren't there there was

1429.039 --> 1434.1589999999999
no plantations or

1431.039 --> 1434.799
anything relating to black people yet

1434.159 --> 1437.44
the whole

1434.799 --> 1439.84
sjw crowd just kept trying to force that

1437.44 --> 1441.919
on everybody like oh yeah if you do that

1439.84 --> 1443.6789999999999
then we will give you a budget i know it

1441.919 --> 1446.0
doesn't make any sense because there is

1443.679 --> 1448.159
no black history over there

1446.0 --> 1449.12
not because they're racist but because

1448.159 --> 1452.24
literally there

1449.12 --> 1453.6
just didn't count nobody came and black

1452.24 --> 1456.559
people came over there it's only when

1453.6 --> 1458.799
the factory started to open they came

1456.559 --> 1459.84
and yeah everybody's gotten like really

1458.799 --> 1464.72
sick of it

1459.84 --> 1467.9189999999999
in that region all that [ __ ] sjw [ __ ]

1464.72 --> 1468.72
and yeah robin stanley basically got

1467.919 --> 1470.96
back

1468.72 --> 1472.96
and everybody was like oh can you please

1470.96 --> 1475.679
take it over

1472.96 --> 1477.76
we want we want this to stop we want the

1475.679 --> 1480.5590000000002
actual history to be

1477.76 --> 1482.0
to be done and she's been given that

1480.559 --> 1484.799
opportunity

1482.0 --> 1487.52
to do that it's pretty incredible i'm

1484.799 --> 1489.679
very happy for her

1487.52 --> 1492.08
it's pretty awesome and like hey her

1489.679 --> 1492.88
hometown does have a very interesting

1492.08 --> 1495.52
history

1492.88 --> 1497.1200000000001
like she told me some about it about how

1495.52 --> 1500.32
it was basically a

1497.12 --> 1501.36
lumber baron town that they would do

1500.32 --> 1504.6399999999999
lumbering and then

1501.36 --> 1506.08
send all that lumber down to chicago

1504.64 --> 1508.88
through the river

1506.08 --> 1509.6
and yeah those families got kind of rich

1508.88 --> 1511.5200000000002
on that

1509.6 --> 1513.36
but they were responsible and they were

1511.52 --> 1514.6399999999999
like good americans not just robber

1513.36 --> 1517.039
barons trying to strip

1514.64 --> 1518.64
everybody of everything they got right

1517.039 --> 1520.8799999999999
and destroying everything so they were

1518.64 --> 1524.4
like responsible

1520.88 --> 1528.0
lumber companies lumber barons

1524.4 --> 1532.799
and then eventually like even like very

1528.0 --> 1536.88
like pre-soviet pre-soviet russians

1532.799 --> 1539.76
came over to that town and then

1536.88 --> 1540.48
yeah helped build it like they became

1539.76 --> 1543.52
like this

1540.48 --> 1547.1200000000001
they became the store like a big

1543.52 --> 1548.32
store front over there very focused on

1547.12 --> 1550.4799999999998
the town like it's

1548.32 --> 1552.24
really interesting community history

1550.48 --> 1554.0
that they have there in that town where

1552.24 --> 1556.159
robin stanley is now at

1554.0 --> 1557.6
and she's been given the opportunity to

1556.159 --> 1561.2
basically

1557.6 --> 1564.32
put down the real history

1561.2 --> 1565.039
of the town and build like expositions

1564.32 --> 1568.1589999999999
for that it's

1565.039 --> 1571.84
fascinating because it

1568.159 --> 1571.8400000000001
does have a very interesting history

1572.24 --> 1577.76
now that she's explained it all to me

1574.4 --> 1577.76
because she did i love that

1582.799 --> 1585.9189999999999
you checked out fat tony's channel is he

1592.799 --> 1600.8799999999999
from other people that he is kind of

1594.96 --> 1603.8400000000001
a freak like with very nasty habits and

1615.36 --> 1619.6
freaking demon

1616.32 --> 1622.72
and it's just really disgusting

1619.6 --> 1625.32

1622.72 --> 1626.799
with good servant for his absolute

1625.32 --> 1630.08
abominable

1626.799 --> 1632.4
personal weakness of becoming a slave to

1630.08 --> 1634.559
this disgusting freak

1632.4 --> 1635.679
it's the worst it's the worst thing you

1634.559 --> 1638.8799999999999

1656.08 --> 1659.6789999999999
and you're not doing anything about it

1657.84 --> 1663.039
you have decided to be a

1659.679 --> 1666.0800000000002
slave to a blatant demon

1663.039 --> 1667.12
and you should be ashamed of yourself to

1666.08 --> 1670.48
no end

1667.12 --> 1672.039
until you decide to break off until you

1670.48 --> 1676.3990000000001
decide to break off

1672.039 --> 1679.12
discontinue this insanity right now

1676.399 --> 1681.36
this guy is a demon he will not bring

1679.12 --> 1684.0
justice to a single individual

1681.36 --> 1685.279
ever his entire life you think he's

1684.0 --> 1688.08
gonna take down people

1685.279 --> 1690.72
no he will not he's only just going to

1688.08 --> 1693.12
spread a lot of [ __ ]

1690.72 --> 1693.76
and that's the only thing you will ever

1693.12 --> 1696.1589999999999
do

1693.76 --> 1698.399
and anything else you project unto him

1696.159 --> 1702.5590000000002
is your delusion

1698.399 --> 1705.52
from satan from satan himself

1702.559 --> 1707.2
making you believe that some freak out

1705.52 --> 1709.36
there is going to do some good

1707.2 --> 1711.2
you should be ashamed of yourself good

1709.36 --> 1713.9189999999999
servant

1711.2 --> 1713.919
ashamed

1717.279 --> 1724.159

1724.159 --> 1726.7990000000002
acting out

1729.84 --> 1733.279
because you will not have any mercy from

1732.72 --> 1738.32
me

1733.279 --> 1739.919
at all until you do that

1738.32 --> 1742.48
and that's also why i kicked you out of

1739.919 --> 1745.44
