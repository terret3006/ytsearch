completely cleared of skies

82.479 --> 89.759
this morning it was extremely misty

85.68 --> 94.4
like really thick mist everywhere

89.759 --> 94.4
but then as the afternoon started

95.119 --> 100.88
or yeah it became like this so all that

100.24 --> 104.72
moist

100.88 --> 108.56
condensed and is absorbed and it's just

104.72 --> 110.96
beautiful sunday very bright

108.56 --> 113.43900000000001
it's still a little bit cold but it's

110.96 --> 117.119
not windy at all

113.439 --> 117.119
so quite beautiful

120.079 --> 129.84
all right so

123.119 --> 129.84
it's sunday the 28th of february 2021

130.56 --> 134.879
and yeah my apologies for starting a

133.12 --> 138.64000000000001
little late

134.879 --> 140.56
because i got kind of hung up on the 24

138.64 --> 142.23899999999998
7 discord which has been very

140.56 --> 143.84
interesting this morning i kind of

142.239 --> 147.36
joined

143.84 --> 148.64000000000001
and yeah that is great conversation has

147.36 --> 151.92000000000002
been going for

148.64 --> 151.92
like at least two hours

152.08 --> 157.84
and then i forgot a little about the

154.84 --> 157.84
time

159.599 --> 171.83999999999997
right so hope to see people

162.8 --> 171.84
join in the chat soon

180.879 --> 188.879
right yesterday was an interesting

184.08 --> 193.84
day overall was very active

188.879 --> 195.92
uh flat earth early bird was a bit messy

193.84 --> 197.92000000000002
but yeah i was kind of stressed out and

195.92 --> 198.95899999999997
like technical issues with the internet

197.92 --> 201.83999999999997
and everything and i

198.959 --> 205.12
yeah i wasn't really too much on point

201.84 --> 208.959
but that all did kind of turn around

205.12 --> 212.48000000000002
later in the evening uh

208.959 --> 214.08
cause ball busters

212.48 --> 218.23899999999998
was live again about the scientific

214.08 --> 222.239
method and it was really

218.239 --> 226.959
on par had a good focus during that

222.239 --> 228.799
and yeah got like i was piled

226.959 --> 231.04
they piled on a lot of compliments

228.799 --> 233.59900000000002
especially this earth passenger who's

231.04 --> 235.519
said to be a glober but he was extremely

233.599 --> 237.83999999999997
complimentary and

235.519 --> 240.72
in detail so he actually did kind of

237.84 --> 243.76
prove that he has been paying attention

240.72 --> 246.08
i really appreciate that

243.76 --> 247.84
made me feel a lot better about myself

246.08 --> 249.28
and what i'm doing here so thank you for

247.84 --> 252.84
that earth passenger and

249.28 --> 254.4
he has basically an invite to at some

252.84 --> 257.2
point

254.4 --> 257.2
get on the show

258.32 --> 264.479
right so that was kind of nice uh

261.44 --> 266.24
i watched some netflix just

264.479 --> 268.15999999999997
browsing around trying to find something

266.24 --> 273.199
new and found this

268.16 --> 276.16
bloody historical thing age of samurai

273.199 --> 278.479
but yeah that that was just so much so

276.16 --> 281.12
bloody and everything that eventually

278.479 --> 284.639
it was interesting but eventually i kind

281.12 --> 287.36
of got a little bit nauseated from it so

284.639 --> 289.84000000000003
after two episodes i'm like okay i'm

287.36 --> 293.84000000000003
good for now

289.84 --> 293.84
but it was really well produced

294.16 --> 299.199
like the actual reenactment footage was

296.479 --> 299.199
really good

301.919 --> 308.79999999999995
anyway yeah the commentary was

306.56 --> 310.96
it was some was good some was kind of

308.8 --> 314.0
like a bit nerdy

310.96 --> 316.32
and all that but just like the the video

314.0 --> 318.639
footage itself was just really good very

316.32 --> 320.8
high movie quality had a real serious

318.639 --> 324.40000000000003
feel to it

320.8 --> 326.88
but yeah it was my sleep just bloody so

324.4 --> 326.88
anyway

336.8 --> 344.0
where was it oh yeah

340.16 --> 347.91900000000004
i posted in master b i posted

344.0 --> 347.919
dr becky's latest video

348.32 --> 355.919
it was funny

353.68 --> 358.639
how we plan to solve the crisis in

355.919 --> 358.639
cosmology

360.96 --> 365.12
that's a really good graphic assistance

363.12 --> 368.16
though but yeah it's

365.12 --> 368.16
familiar grounds

371.759 --> 381.12
hello iron 26 i don't see any ladies

374.96 --> 383.59999999999997

hey steamy traveler good to see you

411.28 --> 414.08
gaining wisdom

418.24 --> 423.919
is the notification system still working

421.68 --> 426.40000000000003
or was it kind of late i don't know how

423.919 --> 428.79999999999995
you usually stumble upon my show if it's

426.4 --> 430.63899999999995
just by notification or if you really go

428.8 --> 433.039
and check my channel during that time i

430.639 --> 433.039
don't know

433.36 --> 440.56
it's good to keep track of these things

437.759 --> 451.84000000000003
anyway i started a little late but i'm

440.56 --> 451.84
still gonna do a full hour show

454.479 --> 458.88
so what have you guys been up to this

457.12 --> 465.84000000000003
saturday

458.88 --> 465.84
and saturday night

489.52 --> 494.96
green tea oh wait i got a bonus i got

493.039 --> 507.84
some coffee for myself i gotta get it

494.96 --> 507.84
first though

560.839 --> 563.839
hmm

567.2 --> 571.6
ah all right doing outside work

571.76 --> 577.8389999999999
well it is a great time for it

578.64 --> 591.8389999999999
spring just around the corner

602.839 --> 605.839
huh

606.32 --> 612.32
yeah so i had some great conversations

608.24 --> 615.44
over a 24 7 discord before i got here

612.32 --> 617.6800000000001
it's kind of tough though to

615.44 --> 619.2
try to emulate that because it was

617.68 --> 622.88
basically a pretty clustered

619.2 --> 622.88
conversation with multiple people

626.64 --> 630.88
but i did also get uh i don't know like

629.44 --> 634.1600000000001
spirit things and

630.88 --> 636.16
we're talking about the bible a lot

634.16 --> 637.68
so many different angles oh yeah i got

636.16 --> 640.64
to basically did

637.68 --> 641.76
do a little mini presentation sort of

640.64 --> 644.959
not with video but

641.76 --> 647.2
just using pictures in chat about my

644.959 --> 648.4799999999999
rectangular looping concept and the

647.2 --> 650.9590000000001
segments

648.48 --> 651.6800000000001
and different layouts and they even went

650.959 --> 655.3599999999999
as far

651.68 --> 658.88
themselves as to start referencing

655.36 --> 662.0790000000001
historical visuals

658.88 --> 663.76
rings so they brought it forth it was

662.079 --> 666.16
really invigorating because that's

663.76 --> 667.279
exactly where i originally got the ideas

666.16 --> 670.3199999999999
from

667.279 --> 672.64
what triggered me to figure out what

670.32 --> 675.279
that actually meant

672.64 --> 676.24
and they really got it i i put the

675.279 --> 678.24
different forms

676.24 --> 681.6800000000001
in the chat and they just really got it

678.24 --> 681.6800000000001
it was very joyous moment

685.44 --> 691.519
what's the link to 24 7 discord okay

689.04 --> 691.519
all right

692.8 --> 705.92
i'll give it let me get it

703.2 --> 708.1600000000001
all right so this is the youtube channel

705.92 --> 708.16
oh

713.44 --> 718.0790000000001
but i do have to warn everyone it's very

716.399 --> 720.079
different from the flat earth debate so

718.079 --> 722.2399999999999
there is not a lot of discipline going

720.079 --> 722.2399999999999
on

725.36 --> 728.48
everybody's really lucky when like the

728.0 --> 730.56
mood

728.48 --> 732.48
is stable and nobody's yeah because

730.56 --> 734.16
there is a lot of tendency to start

732.48 --> 735.76
rumpusing especially when it gets a

734.16 --> 738.48
little crowded

735.76 --> 739.279
but yeah i had it had a really good

738.48 --> 742.24
moment

739.279 --> 744.079
might still be very good right now has

742.24 --> 747.76
been for hours

744.079 --> 747.76
that's why i wanted to be a part of that

748.0 --> 751.36
right so check it out it's a place that

750.399 --> 754.24
i do go to

751.36 --> 754.24
every now and then

755.6 --> 758.9590000000001
and yeah flat earth debaters also hang

757.6 --> 764.24
around there so you can

758.959 --> 768.6389999999999
often find adam meekin sleeping warrior

764.24 --> 768.639
qe are in there a lot

768.959 --> 776.16
but so are a whole bunch of other people

772.959 --> 786.3199999999999
right so

776.16 --> 789.8389999999999
i hope that's interesting

786.32 --> 791.6800000000001
man super annoying

789.839 --> 794.24
somebody found a bag of fireworks

791.68 --> 794.2399999999999
apparently

794.88 --> 801.8389999999999
it's very disruptive

812.839 --> 816.0790000000001
anyway

814.24 --> 818.32
if they keep it up i am gonna call the

816.079 --> 821.04
cops on them

818.32 --> 829.839
because this is not the time to do that

821.04 --> 829.8389999999999
sort of [ __ ]

834.079 --> 840.079
right so yeah anything in particular

837.92 --> 845.279
anybody in chat would like me to

840.079 --> 847.3599999999999
talk about or explain or some news item

845.279 --> 848.399
you know there is a lot happening in the

847.36 --> 851.6
news and

848.399 --> 853.36
yeah i've noticed most of it i don't

851.6 --> 856.9590000000001
really treat

853.36 --> 859.6
i'm not a news channel but i do

856.959 --> 860.079
like to analyze certain events sometimes

859.6 --> 862.0
i have

860.079 --> 863.92
like historical interest in trying to

862.0 --> 867.12
figure out

863.92 --> 868.8389999999999
when it really means something and when

867.12 --> 873.44
it's a distraction so

868.839 --> 876.0
yeah i do bring up news things

873.44 --> 877.7600000000001
but yeah not like oh god this just

876.0 --> 880.48
happened and now

877.76 --> 882.8389999999999
to pull everybody's attention into that

880.48 --> 884.32
railroad specifically i try not to do

882.839 --> 886.399
that

884.32 --> 887.519
and i have done it occasionally in the

886.399 --> 890.24
past especially

887.519 --> 891.12
referencing well alex jones because he

890.24 --> 894.16
kind of is

891.12 --> 895.839
my new source in a lot of ways and i am

894.16 --> 900.079
very well aware of

895.839 --> 903.519
certain type of narratives that he does

900.079 --> 904.959
that he is a part of but still despite

903.519 --> 907.839
that

904.959 --> 908.6389999999999
i do overall appreciate what's coming

907.839 --> 912.0790000000001
out there

908.639 --> 914.16
besides the advertisements although the

912.079 --> 915.92
advertisements are even kind of decent

914.16 --> 916.639
in quality and the products are very

915.92 --> 918.4799999999999
good

916.639 --> 920.24
but yeah getting the same advertisements

918.48 --> 924.16
over and over again is just

920.24 --> 924.16
annoying doesn't matter how good it is

925.04 --> 928.3199999999999
yeah bombing of syria exactly because

927.519 --> 931.44
that happened

928.32 --> 931.44
a few days ago

931.92 --> 938.8389999999999
on the other hand to be fair

935.6 --> 940.0
there was a certain moment in the trump

938.839 --> 942.399
administration

940.0 --> 944.32
where he kind of did the same thing

942.399 --> 946.24
remember that

944.32 --> 948.0
remember the missile strikes on the air

946.24 --> 955.839
base

948.0 --> 955.839
so right so what does it mean really

956.32 --> 960.88
i haven't looked into the details of the

958.48 --> 963.839
strike or anything i did the last time

960.88 --> 965.279
i this time i just didn't get to it i'm

963.839 --> 966.5600000000001
like there's going to be plenty of

965.279 --> 968.079
people that are going to do that and

966.56 --> 970.2399999999999
they're going to be much more proficient

968.079 --> 972.6389999999999
at it

970.24 --> 973.519
just wait and see what people roll out

972.639 --> 982.0
about it

973.519 --> 985.839
over time

982.0 --> 990.24
right but yeah as a rule of fist iron

985.839 --> 992.24
26 when

990.24 --> 994.32
there's a bombing of the us and syria

992.24 --> 996.0790000000001
you you can bet your bottom dollar it

994.32 --> 997.0400000000001
has to do with the military industrial

996.079 --> 999.04
complex which

997.04 --> 1002.24
unfortunately is a very persistent and

999.04 --> 1002.24
powerful influence

1002.32 --> 1007.12
on the united states government so that

1005.759 --> 1011.839
part you can

1007.12 --> 1011.839
already figure out

1016.8 --> 1021.199
but that doesn't automatically reveal

1019.44 --> 1039.839
the strategy

1021.199 --> 1039.839
of the engagement anyway

1050.84 --> 1053.84
so

1063.679 --> 1068.88
right iron 26 well maybe biden's just

1066.64 --> 1070.72
moved on to a point

1068.88 --> 1072.72
where practically he doesn't give a [ __ ]

1070.72 --> 1074.96
anymore he's just going at the program

1072.72 --> 1076.96
he's not trying to even

1074.96 --> 1079.1200000000001
uphold appearances of some kind of

1076.96 --> 1081.8400000000001
justification maybe that's

1079.12 --> 1083.76
why it happened the way it happened now

1081.84 --> 1086.72
there is kind of this weird arrogance

1083.76 --> 1086.72
going forth

1088.48 --> 1091.679
from the biden government

1092.64 --> 1096.64
and at the same time oh yeah i almost i

1094.559 --> 1099.84
didn't i forgot to make a note

1096.64 --> 1104.0800000000002
i also watched that

1099.84 --> 1104.08
is it a gop

1104.48 --> 1112.08
talk or monologue from

1108.0 --> 1115.12
this general that was weird

1112.08 --> 1118.6399999999999
and especially the way he sounded

1115.12 --> 1120.559
like he seemed kind of nervous

1118.64 --> 1122.48
but maybe he is like that i don't know i

1120.559 --> 1124.72
don't know that individual but there was

1122.48 --> 1127.919
a lot of vibes coming from it

1124.72 --> 1129.76
so his name again general petraeus was

1127.919 --> 1137.3600000000001
it

1129.76 --> 1140.72
could be another one let me look it up

1137.36 --> 1140.7199999999998
i hope i can

1140.88 --> 1143.679
where's that guy

1145.6 --> 1151.12
oh nice state yeah state secretary

1148.4 --> 1153.919
pompeo that was the one

1151.12 --> 1155.28
oh at cpac was in the gop right so i got

1153.919 --> 1159.039
everything wrong initially

1155.28 --> 1161.76
it's brilliant yeah

1159.039 --> 1161.76
i watched that

1163.039 --> 1166.08
and it was a little odd

1166.4 --> 1171.8400000000001
and in ways also a little underwhelming

1169.039 --> 1171.84
and that was weird

1175.039 --> 1180.8799999999999
creepy joe was in town here friday what

1178.64 --> 1180.88
where

1182.48 --> 1193.84
in australia

1203.36 --> 1208.24
oh my oh wait

1206.559 --> 1210.48
right i don't know why i thought you

1208.24 --> 1212.32
were in australia

1210.48 --> 1221.84
i don't know i mixed you up right in

1212.32 --> 1221.84
houston texas okay goody

1227.52 --> 1231.2
so how is the power situation currently

1230.159 --> 1234.0
in

1231.2 --> 1234.72
in texas in the free spell i haven't

1234.0 --> 1237.679
heard of it

1234.72 --> 1239.28
in a while has the giant frost spell

1237.679 --> 1241.2
passed

1239.28 --> 1249.84
or is it still just as bad as it was a

1241.2 --> 1249.8400000000001
week ago

1260.0 --> 1267.6
stable that's that's not very revealing

1264.559 --> 1270.6399999999999
as in stable frost

1267.6 --> 1271.6789999999999
or because if it's stable minus 50

1270.64 --> 1277.8400000000001
degrees it's still

1271.679 --> 1277.8400000000001
[ __ ] right so what is what do you mean

1281.52 --> 1291.84
is it still freezing or isn't it

1301.36 --> 1305.28
do i think they are messing with the

1302.88 --> 1307.919
weather neil cosentino

1305.28 --> 1307.9189999999999
well yeah

1310.48 --> 1314.64
i think that weather control has been

1313.12 --> 1318.6399999999999
applied for

1314.64 --> 1321.1200000000001
for several decades now yes

1318.64 --> 1323.8400000000001
and is it possible in my opinion i don't

1321.12 --> 1326.4799999999998
need to have an opinion about it it's

1323.84 --> 1327.36
officially demonstrated to be possible

1326.48 --> 1330.84
there's

1327.36 --> 1332.08
like yeah there's geoengineering

1330.84 --> 1333.9189999999999
projects

1332.08 --> 1336.6399999999999
you know they there can't be any

1333.919 --> 1341.2800000000002
projects if there wasn't some kind of

1336.64 --> 1347.8400000000001
effective thing to have a project with

1341.28 --> 1347.84
so yes they definitely can do that

1355.84 --> 1361.84
operation popeye what's that never heard

1358.48 --> 1361.84
of that

1374.48 --> 1382.0
okay my god thanks good to know

1378.24 --> 1382.0
so at least the cold spell itself is

1386.84 --> 1389.84
over

1400.84 --> 1403.84
hmm

1404.88 --> 1410.24
controlled project controlled weather

1411.919 --> 1419.039
okay yeah 76

1416.32 --> 1419.9189999999999
72 right yeah that's that's actually

1419.039 --> 1423.679
what i was

1419.919 --> 1425.5200000000002
referencing and that was decades ago

1423.679 --> 1427.76
indeed somewhere in the 60s so yeah

1425.52 --> 1431.84
that's the one project popeye i didn't

1427.76 --> 1431.84
even know what's called that

1445.12 --> 1449.279
right and i i believe it was actually

1447.679 --> 1452.72
standardized

1449.279 --> 1452.72
with through industry

1453.279 --> 1460.32
in 1995.

1458.4 --> 1461.8400000000001
that's when it really started to happen

1460.32 --> 1464.1589999999999
everywhere

1461.84 --> 1466.24
and it's not the same you know some

1464.159 --> 1467.6000000000001
places have really been like chemically

1466.24 --> 1470.96
attacked

1467.6 --> 1474.799
and others i did they don't they do it

1470.96 --> 1477.8400000000001
another way and i've suspected that they

1474.799 --> 1481.12
might be applying just simple

1477.84 --> 1484.48
sand dust for certain

1481.12 --> 1486.7199999999998
types of weather modification alteration

1484.48 --> 1488.0
so it doesn't all have to be

1486.72 --> 1491.3600000000001
nefariousness

1488.0 --> 1495.44
necessarily but i'm pretty sure it has

1491.36 --> 1498.84
been in certain regions at certain times

1495.44 --> 1502.4
there have been tests barium salts

1498.84 --> 1505.52
aluminum all that

1502.4 --> 1507.52
that doesn't mean that that is a part of

1505.52 --> 1510.559
every single chemtrail that is ever

1507.52 --> 1510.559
sprayed right

1511.679 --> 1517.8400000000001
that's yeah it's a bit of an over

1514.24 --> 1517.84
generalization to assume that

1527.6 --> 1529.84
yes

1534.64 --> 1537.679
yeah but carol apple the thing is if

1537.12 --> 1541.6789999999999
they are

1537.679 --> 1544.799
actually spraying nano aluminum

1541.679 --> 1548.64
then that would have a very

1544.799 --> 1551.679
measurable result on nature

1548.64 --> 1555.8400000000001
very very measurable

1551.679 --> 1559.76
so yeah the region will reveal it

1555.84 --> 1559.76
whether that is indeed going on or not

1562.72 --> 1567.3600000000001
because if they are spraying aluminum

1564.64 --> 1569.919
then your yeah take

1567.36 --> 1570.7199999999998
forest soil samples water samples all

1569.919 --> 1572.96
that and

1570.72 --> 1574.559
yeah you will start to see it show up

1572.96 --> 1578.4
it's typically bio

1574.559 --> 1585.84
accumulative and all that

1578.4 --> 1585.8400000000001
wherever it is absorbed

1587.039 --> 1592.799
and i think also that it might acidify

1590.4 --> 1594.24
the ground eventually all that sort of

1592.799 --> 1596.24
thing

1594.24 --> 1598.08
but yeah if there are regions where it's

1596.24 --> 1599.76
just like hey yeah this has happened oh

1598.08 --> 1602.8799999999999
where's it coming from well

1599.76 --> 1604.8799999999999
yeah there's no big industry right

1602.88 --> 1608.3200000000002
around the corner or

1604.88 --> 1609.7600000000002
up the river or anything well where else

1608.32 --> 1613.84
can it then come from

1609.76 --> 1613.84
you know

1614.48 --> 1618.559
especially if it's really evenly spread

1624.84 --> 1627.84
out

1635.12 --> 1641.84
yeah well monsanto can go screw

1638.84 --> 1641.84
themselves

1666.84 --> 1669.84
so

1674.399 --> 1676.7199999999998
hmm

1679.279 --> 1685.84
what are you talking about a gym

1682.64 --> 1688.3200000000002
dry ice they use

1685.84 --> 1689.4399999999998
what you think they use dry eyes for

1688.32 --> 1697.84
mini chemtrails

1689.44 --> 1697.8400000000001
that's really silly thing to say hey jim

1708.84 --> 1711.84
right

1736.559 --> 1739.84
hello cooler bokken

1742.72 --> 1748.08
class scene can be done with triads okay

1745.52 --> 1748.08
interesting

1751.44 --> 1756.48
i guess as a weather modification

1753.84 --> 1758.6399999999999
application that could be used then

1756.48 --> 1759.84
but i don't think that the typical

1758.64 --> 1763.279
trails that we see

1759.84 --> 1764.559
are dry ice because i think it probably

1763.279 --> 1768.64
would have an effect

1764.559 --> 1768.6399999999999
just not so much visual

1769.279 --> 1773.679
because it's just gonna evaporate

1775.6 --> 1780.0
yeah that's correct kula my sound

1778.96 --> 1782.559
unfortunately is

1780.0 --> 1783.36
asymmetrical so because of technical

1782.559 --> 1786.6399999999999
issues that i

1783.36 --> 1789.6789999999999
am unable to fix at the current time

1786.64 --> 1792.3990000000001
i hope that changes in the future

1789.679 --> 1793.919
so for now i recommend you don't listen

1792.399 --> 1797.52
on a headphone because then it's going

1793.919 --> 1797.5200000000002
to be highly asymmetrical

1806.84 --> 1809.84
sorry

1822.72 --> 1826.32
and welcome to the chat by the way

1829.2 --> 1837.8400000000001
can i ask you something where how did

1832.399 --> 1837.84
you find this channel

1845.12 --> 1852.8799999999999
any updates on the no foul and buchanan

1849.279 --> 1854.88
it's there's still situations in holding

1852.88 --> 1857.279
but i've got the all the appointments

1854.88 --> 1860.48
that i'll be needing

1857.279 --> 1860.48
i have it in my head

1860.88 --> 1864.72
what's going to transpire one way or the

1862.96 --> 1869.2
other

1864.72 --> 1869.2
it was recommended oh cool

1869.76 --> 1875.679
but i mean from where

1872.88 --> 1877.6000000000001
like were you watching the flat earth

1875.679 --> 1879.519
debates or what were you watching how

1877.6 --> 1881.4399999999998
did you stumble upon this channel

1879.519 --> 1883.76
so i'm always very curious to this sort

1881.44 --> 1883.76
of thing

1885.2 --> 1893.8400000000001
what happened to my hair nothing

1899.279 --> 1902.0
by a friend

1902.32 --> 1905.519
from where you don't have to say who it

1904.0 --> 1907.84
is by the way or anything

1905.519 --> 1910.08
if you think that they wouldn't want to

1907.84 --> 1910.08
say

1916.08 --> 1921.84
somebody sent you a link

1941.84 --> 1946.9599999999998
cool this is good to hear that people

1944.64 --> 1949.1200000000001
are sharing

1946.96 --> 1950.88
i did say i mean platform you deem fit

1949.12 --> 1953.12
and that also means hey if you want to

1950.88 --> 1955.519
forward it to a specific individual

1953.12 --> 1956.2399999999998
and not so much on a platform where

1955.519 --> 1958.559
everybody

1956.24 --> 1960.64
in that platform can see it that's also

1958.559 --> 1961.279
fine if you don't have somebody specific

1960.64 --> 1963.919
on mind

1961.279 --> 1966.399
that you think could appreciate this

1963.919 --> 1966.3990000000001
what i do

1970.399 --> 1974.6399999999999
the sec the 2k barrier

1975.44 --> 1980.159
the oh right subscriber ah

1980.24 --> 1987.76
i'm not even looking at that

1984.159 --> 1991.8400000000001
too much anymore i'm much more

1987.76 --> 1991.84
interested in actual reach

1993.039 --> 1996.48
not so much subscribers

1998.159 --> 2005.8400000000001
what's going on

2007.12 --> 2009.6789999999999
just sub

2012.24 --> 2016.799
what violent volcanic you weren't subbed

2014.72 --> 2020.799
to my channel

2016.799 --> 2020.799
i've been seeing you in my chat for ages

2022.48 --> 2033.84
or were you unsub then you had to resub

2025.519 --> 2033.84
because that also does happen

2062.32 --> 2066.32
took me a while okay

2072.839 --> 2075.839
cool

2080.96 --> 2085.76
right so kula bokken do you know

2083.28 --> 2088.5600000000004
anything about flat earth

2085.76 --> 2089.8390000000004
that the friend sending you the link to

2088.56 --> 2091.919
my channel

2089.839 --> 2103.839
tell you about flat earth was that the

2091.919 --> 2103.839
reason he gave you the link

2113.599 --> 2117.839
like a fine wine okay

2145.839 --> 2153.68
oh he thought you would

2148.96 --> 2153.68
think this is funny all right

2154.0 --> 2159.839
so your friend is a bit of a baller then

2156.079 --> 2159.8390000000004
i guess

2161.04 --> 2163.44
all right

2164.16 --> 2171.359
well i hear that i can be funny at times

2168.16 --> 2173.44
it's just something that kind of happens

2171.359 --> 2176.7999999999997
not something like i'm not like an

2173.44 --> 2176.8
active comedian like that

2177.2 --> 2181.359
but i have my silly moods at times

2182.16 --> 2189.44
but i mostly just try to be very clear

2185.359 --> 2201.839
honest informative and as direct

2189.44 --> 2201.839
as i can

2204.32 --> 2210.1600000000003
hmm ah yes

2207.52 --> 2211.68
fallon buchanan yeah i i was very proud

2210.16 --> 2214.3199999999997
of that episode the

2211.68 --> 2215.52
weight of the soul how much does the

2214.32 --> 2218.4
soul weigh

2215.52 --> 2218.8
because it was just a very ethereal

2218.4 --> 2222.32
thing

2218.8 --> 2224.96
and then really applying the physics

2222.32 --> 2226.839
to that how do you do that it was it was

2224.96 --> 2232.0
a fantastic

2226.839 --> 2234.16
exercise very proud of that

2232.0 --> 2237.359
i feel very lucky to have stumbled upon

2234.16 --> 2240.72
that and it was brought to me in chat

2237.359 --> 2242.4
so just goes to show that this chat

2240.72 --> 2246.16
interaction system that i have going

2242.4 --> 2246.1600000000003
with the early bird show does really

2254.839 --> 2257.839
work

2261.359 --> 2265.359
beat poetry what

2268.64 --> 2275.2799999999997
you mean like beatnik poetry

2273.04 --> 2276.96
my metaphysical discussions are like

2275.28 --> 2281.44
beatnik poetry really

2276.96 --> 2284.7200000000003
ah i'm afraid i'm not

2281.44 --> 2287.92
historically or well that's not

2284.72 --> 2287.9199999999996
historically uh

2288.079 --> 2292.2400000000002
what do you call that writing

2294.32 --> 2300.8
i guess it would be literacy right

2298.4 --> 2301.6800000000003
i'm not i'm not too literate when it

2300.8 --> 2305.2000000000003
comes to

2301.68 --> 2307.2
writer's styles and that was something

2305.2 --> 2310.3999999999996
that we also did kind of

2307.2 --> 2312.56
study in school different theories

2310.4 --> 2313.359
different writing styles but to be fair

2312.56 --> 2317.359
like

2313.359 --> 2318.16
ah i i got a headache of all these

2317.359 --> 2319.68
writers

2318.16 --> 2322.0
and why everybody thought they were so

2319.68 --> 2324.96
special

2322.0 --> 2327.839
so this that novel never really appealed

2324.96 --> 2327.839
to me in school

2332.16 --> 2341.839
there's a lot of special boy riders in

2334.079 --> 2341.8390000000004
the netherlands

2362.49 --> 2366.9599999999996
[Music]

2363.76 --> 2367.76
i don't know batnik that's a term i've

2366.96 --> 2370.16
never heard

2367.76 --> 2370.1600000000003
before

2370.96 --> 2374.2400000000002
but yes abstract trainer thought

2372.72 --> 2375.2
expressed to an audience and the weird

2374.24 --> 2377.5989999999997
thing is

2375.2 --> 2378.72
it's very often happens like even in the

2377.599 --> 2381.28
moment

2378.72 --> 2382.7999999999997
i start an explanation about something i

2381.28 --> 2385.92
set up

2382.8 --> 2389.3590000000004
the structures that i'm going to go

2385.92 --> 2392.16
past with my verbal

2389.359 --> 2394.4
explanation and then i realize that

2392.16 --> 2397.1189999999997
there are multiple ways of looking at

2394.4 --> 2398.56
in that moment while i'm explaining it

2397.119 --> 2402.32
it's like okay

2398.56 --> 2403.839
this is how i in a good mood when

2402.32 --> 2405.52
interpreted this is how i would

2403.839 --> 2407.2799999999997
interpret it in a bad way this is how i

2405.52 --> 2409.04
would interpret it in an exploitive way

2407.28 --> 2409.76
this is how i would interpret it in the

2409.04 --> 2412.24
sociopath

2409.76 --> 2414.6400000000003
there's so many ways to interpret things

2412.24 --> 2417.52
that i say sometimes

2414.64 --> 2417.52
it's pretty weird

2418.079 --> 2420.7200000000003
oh god

2422.16 --> 2425.839
biker [ __ ]

2432.48 --> 2438.079
but yeah that really does occur and i

2435.68 --> 2441.2
even noticed it as i explained things

2438.079 --> 2443.04
and sometimes it creeps me out it almost

2441.2 --> 2444.7999999999997
gives me to feel like yeah they could be

2443.04 --> 2446.8
watching

2444.8 --> 2448.0
because there's something in in what i

2446.8 --> 2450.319
say

2448.0 --> 2452.64
even to people that are in ways very

2450.319 --> 2455.44
alien to me

2452.64 --> 2457.52
because i can still understand them even

2455.44 --> 2460.2400000000002
though they are alien

2457.52 --> 2460.24
in their spirit

2460.8 --> 2463.2000000000003
anyway

2464.64 --> 2472.56
but i do typically prefer abstract

2468.4 --> 2475.92
as in because of the just the

2472.56 --> 2476.4
enormous synchronicity potential in

2475.92 --> 2479.119
things

2476.4 --> 2480.1600000000003
happening you know you explain something

2479.119 --> 2482.48
say

2480.16 --> 2483.2799999999997
compare situation happening in a flat

2482.48 --> 2486.16
earth

2483.28 --> 2486.96
debate versus the globers and then you

2486.16 --> 2488.319
compare it into

2486.96 --> 2492.319
[Music]

2488.319 --> 2494.56
left right politics right

2492.319 --> 2495.92
and then you can even like in each

2494.56 --> 2499.04
region

2495.92 --> 2501.52
sub compartments and their struggles

2499.04 --> 2503.04
it is also very similar the patterns

2501.52 --> 2504.48
that are followed and that's why i like

2503.04 --> 2507.04
to explain that

2504.48 --> 2509.28
because then i'm having a very specific

2507.04 --> 2510.8
thing in mind but i immediately as i'm

2509.28 --> 2513.6800000000003
engaging realize

2510.8 --> 2514.8
there's more regions that this applies

2513.68 --> 2517.68
to as well

2514.8 --> 2518.48
but i can then leave those out not

2517.68 --> 2520.16
mention them

2518.48 --> 2522.0
yet people that will have that on their

2520.16 --> 2525.359
mind will listen in to what i

2522.0 --> 2529.359
say and then have the confirmation

2525.359 --> 2532.56
through the other unmentioned field

2529.359 --> 2537.839
yeah and that is the sort of stuff that

2532.56 --> 2537.839
i love to do

2540.8 --> 2549.04
that reveals the esoterics the meaning

2545.92 --> 2551.28
beyond the words that share meaning with

2549.04 --> 2553.359
other things

2551.28 --> 2565.52
even though they're not yeah even

2553.359 --> 2569.359
mentioned that's what i love

2565.52 --> 2571.92
right yeah poets you know poets have

2569.359 --> 2574.64
usually have the time to think about

2571.92 --> 2576.2400000000002
what they write down before they say it

2574.64 --> 2578.64
i have to do pretty much everything

2576.24 --> 2580.72
spontaneously but then again

2578.64 --> 2582.48
i do it every day and it's like yeah

2580.72 --> 2583.1189999999997
you're going to sit in front of a camera

2582.48 --> 2586.0
now

2583.119 --> 2588.7200000000003
you can just say nothing or say bland

2586.0 --> 2591.52
things or you could just give it a try

2588.72 --> 2593.2
right so in a way yeah i guess in a way

2591.52 --> 2594.8
i do approach it a little bit like a

2593.2 --> 2597.7599999999998
poet

2594.8 --> 2597.76
but i just do it

2598.079 --> 2601.92
and i don't it's like not priority it's

2601.28 --> 2606.8
just

2601.92 --> 2610.319
the way i do things anyway

2606.8 --> 2610.319
interesting to hear you're a poet

2617.2 --> 2621.839
hello dutch sailor

2631.92 --> 2637.44
yes follow that bouquet yes that part i

2634.48 --> 2640.16
do know about the beat nick

2637.44 --> 2641.92
that live thing that rawness but that

2640.16 --> 2642.8799999999997
was the whole thing about the beatniks

2641.92 --> 2646.48
wasn't it

2642.88 --> 2646.96
it was non-conformity i was like oh i'm

2646.48 --> 2649.92
not

2646.96 --> 2650.88
i'm doing my own i'm gonna be the young

2649.92 --> 2654.319
guy or gal

2650.88 --> 2656.8
and screw screw the man

2654.319 --> 2660.079
right and be spontaneous it's all about

2656.8 --> 2660.079
the spontaneity and

2662.24 --> 2665.359
so that is very beat

2669.28 --> 2673.92
i think i would be quite good at it

2671.52 --> 2673.92
maybe

2674.0 --> 2679.76
on the other hand sometimes my voice can

2676.88 --> 2682.079
be slightly monotonous

2679.76 --> 2684.1600000000003
but that's usually when i sink deeper

2682.079 --> 2686.1600000000003
into the thoughts

2684.16 --> 2687.2799999999997
instead of focusing more on my

2686.16 --> 2689.44
expression of

2687.28 --> 2691.6800000000003
feeling i have about something because

2689.44 --> 2695.119
then i can get very

2691.68 --> 2696.96
very emotion expressive and facial

2695.119 --> 2699.119
movement details and all that

2696.96 --> 2702.4
but when i get technical i do get kind

2699.119 --> 2702.4
of like a robot a little

2702.48 --> 2706.96
it even annoys me when i watch myself

2704.64 --> 2706.96
back

2708.24 --> 2711.839
so yeah that's also a work in progress

2710.8 --> 2715.28
it would be great

2711.839 --> 2718.72
if i can the both sides

2715.28 --> 2721.76
of the spectrum of my actions if i could

2718.72 --> 2723.52
as it were blend them in more

2721.76 --> 2725.44
so there would be more natural

2723.52 --> 2728.8
expression happening

2725.44 --> 2732.319
in my technical explanations

2728.8 --> 2734.6400000000003
and when i'm very feeling oriented

2732.319 --> 2736.88
that i can still insert effectively

2734.64 --> 2739.52
insert technical details as well

2736.88 --> 2747.839
that would be a great end result to aim

2739.52 --> 2747.839
for in this entire development process

2761.2 --> 2775.839
life nasa speak what really life fly sky

2764.96 --> 2779.44
flat sky

2775.839 --> 2782.88
i was born three decades too late maybe

2779.44 --> 2784.64
no 50s 60s yeah but

2782.88 --> 2786.4
that time would have been very dangerous

2784.64 --> 2788.16
for me

2786.4 --> 2790.079
i think there's a lot of things that

2788.16 --> 2790.72
people are overlooking that were also

2790.079 --> 2794.2400000000002
going on

2790.72 --> 2795.839
back then that

2794.24 --> 2798.64
i guess boomers and all that don't

2795.839 --> 2802.0
really like to talk about that much

2798.64 --> 2805.04
i think there was a whole covert crack

2802.0 --> 2807.44
down from the shadows on people

2805.04 --> 2809.92
like the sort of secret mafia [ __ ] going

2807.44 --> 2813.68
on through the government and all that

2809.92 --> 2815.599
back then and i would have probably been

2813.68 --> 2817.839
one of the first to be targeted by such

2815.599 --> 2817.839
a thing

2818.0 --> 2823.52
you know because in ways it is very

2821.28 --> 2826.7200000000003
similar to the situation on the internet

2823.52 --> 2829.44
that is happening in a much broader form

2826.72 --> 2830.0789999999997
as to what was happening back then and

2829.44 --> 2831.839
even

2830.079 --> 2834.0
like this is even kind of in the

2831.839 --> 2836.0
conspiracy theory section of

2834.0 --> 2837.599
the music industry it's kind of well

2836.0 --> 2841.52
known

2837.599 --> 2844.079
they want as much trashiness

2841.52 --> 2845.839
corruption laziness the bad trace they

2844.079 --> 2848.319
want them to stand out

2845.839 --> 2850.0
so if you're too pure and you're getting

2848.319 --> 2852.5589999999997
too much attention that makes you a

2850.0 --> 2852.559
danger

2855.92 --> 2862.2400000000002
right and back then if you were just

2859.28 --> 2862.88
hitting it off then things would happen

2862.24 --> 2867.04
now

2862.88 --> 2870.079
there's algorithms to contain so much

2867.04 --> 2872.64
so i can just be exactly what i am

2870.079 --> 2874.1600000000003
and it'll just not spread as far and

2872.64 --> 2876.5589999999997
wide

2874.16 --> 2878.16
the numbers will stay down and that way

2876.559 --> 2881.8390000000004
i don't have to be a fret

2878.16 --> 2885.2
threat and still can be as pure

2881.839 --> 2888.0789999999997
as i as i do my best to

2885.2 --> 2888.96
right so there is weirdly enough a big

2888.079 --> 2892.1600000000003
advantage

2888.96 --> 2894.4
to the disadvantage of this situation

2892.16 --> 2895.2
compared to 30 years ago and that's why

2894.4 --> 2898.1600000000003
i say

2895.2 --> 2899.1189999999997
no i'm pretty sure i was born exactly in

2898.16 --> 2902.16
the right age

2899.119 --> 2904.559
at the right time in the right moment

2902.16 --> 2906.48
because with my characteristics and the

2904.559 --> 2908.4
ways i reflect upon things happening in

2906.48 --> 2909.68
the world if i'd been born 30 years

2908.4 --> 2912.839
earlier

2909.68 --> 2914.0789999999997
i would have probably fared very

2912.839 --> 2916.24
differently

2914.079 --> 2918.1600000000003
so yes i have actually thought about

2916.24 --> 2920.0789999999997
such things because hey i

2918.16 --> 2922.16
have had a lot of periods in my life

2920.079 --> 2923.2000000000003
where i feel extremely out of place i'm

2922.16 --> 2925.92
like

2923.2 --> 2927.2
what am i what am i supposed to be doing

2925.92 --> 2930.16
here

2927.2 --> 2931.1189999999997
why do i see all these things and can't

2930.16 --> 2934.0789999999997
do anything about

2931.119 --> 2937.839
it yeah introspective [ __ ] so i have

2934.079 --> 2937.8390000000004
actually wondered that sort of thing

2940.48 --> 2943.52
and people have said such things before

2942.64 --> 2946.5589999999997
it's like oh

2943.52 --> 2951.28
you should have been around at that time

2946.559 --> 2951.28
this time yeah

2951.68 --> 2961.1189999999997
no i'm pretty sure i i was meant to be a

2957.04 --> 2963.52
a knit early computer

2961.119 --> 2963.52
boomer

2965.68 --> 2970.5589999999997
in between the transition where

2967.359 --> 2973.839
computers were purely code into

2970.559 --> 2976.079
purely games

2973.839 --> 2976.96
as where it is now it's just raw

2976.079 --> 2979.6800000000003
entertainment

2976.96 --> 2981.04
and kind of dumbed down it was right in

2979.68 --> 2984.48
in the middle period of that

2981.04 --> 2988.0
and that helped shape me because it

2984.48 --> 2990.559
i felt it in computers i felt the code i

2988.0 --> 2992.079
felt like people are thinking about it

2990.559 --> 2994.1600000000003
how is the thinking about it

2992.079 --> 2995.52
improving the code i had like this

2994.16 --> 2998.7999999999997
virtual landscape

2995.52 --> 3000.24
in my mind of how it is all developing

2998.8 --> 3003.2000000000003
where is it going to go what

3000.24 --> 3006.319
are the long-term obstacles it was very

3003.2 --> 3008.8799999999997
concerned also with like

3006.319 --> 3009.44
like hacker principles not crackers but

3008.88 --> 3011.6800000000003
hackers

3009.44 --> 3013.68
like the real free code and all that

3011.68 --> 3016.8799999999997
it's close to heart still

3013.68 --> 3017.44
it's also one of the reasons kind of why

3016.88 --> 3020.0
i have

3017.44 --> 3020.64
sympathy for the pirate party because

3020.0 --> 3024.64
they are

3020.64 --> 3026.5589999999997
really anchored in that sort of thing

3024.64 --> 3028.319
and it's because of the time i was born

3026.559 --> 3031.119
in

3028.319 --> 3032.079
because i was right in the middle of my

3031.119 --> 3033.92
own growth

3032.079 --> 3036.559
when that thing was happening in the

3033.92 --> 3036.559
world as well

3038.72 --> 3041.9199999999996
and i was very close to it programmers

3040.72 --> 3043.52
all around me

3041.92 --> 3046.8
i was like the only one that wasn't a

3043.52 --> 3048.72
programmer sometimes i think

3046.8 --> 3051.119
but it's never worked really smooth for

3048.72 --> 3053.4399999999996
me although i have

3051.119 --> 3055.2000000000003
fooled around with it a little here and

3053.44 --> 3057.04
there

3055.2 --> 3058.72
the problem was is that the code there

3057.04 --> 3060.079
was always some kind of new code that

3058.72 --> 3062.48
was the next best thing

3060.079 --> 3064.48
so it took me so much effort to just try

3062.48 --> 3067.599
to figure out the basics

3064.48 --> 3068.16
with literally commodore basic and then

3067.599 --> 3070.0
it's like oh

3068.16 --> 3071.52
but now there's c plus plus and oh look

3070.0 --> 3073.119
there's java i know this

3071.52 --> 3075.2
just gave me a freaking headache it's

3073.119 --> 3078.2400000000002
like i'm not gonna

3075.2 --> 3081.4399999999996
freaking assimilate all that [ __ ]

3078.24 --> 3084.3999999999996
that's not my job that's not what my

3081.44 --> 3084.4
mind was meant for

3086.0 --> 3097.839
it disrupts my natural thinking

3090.64 --> 3097.839
if i all replace that all with code

3102.0 --> 3106.24
what do you wonder what internet social

3104.079 --> 3108.4
media will be like in decades from now

3106.24 --> 3110.8799999999997
i think that there's going to be a big

3108.4 --> 3112.7200000000003
retraction in social media

3110.88 --> 3115.599
from the general public i think that the

3112.72 --> 3117.5989999999997
fad is going to wear off

3115.599 --> 3119.3590000000004
and the obstacles are going to remain

3117.599 --> 3122.319
and i think that's going to basically

3119.359 --> 3123.04
be just separated chat rooms groups that

3122.319 --> 3126.24
people hatch

3123.04 --> 3129.839
to and there will be media high places

3126.24 --> 3132.0789999999997
they will be more controlled

3129.839 --> 3132.0789999999997
so

3133.28 --> 3138.48
it's not really going to get back to

3135.119 --> 3141.04
what it was 20 years ago but with

3138.48 --> 3143.839
upgraded interfaces and all that

3141.04 --> 3143.839
unfortunately

3148.4 --> 3153.44
yeah now it's done monkey 3d it's really

3150.4 --> 3158.64
just not my thing okay i'm 41 years old

3153.44 --> 3158.64
if i was into coding i'd know it by now

3160.8 --> 3167.8390000000004
but i do understand how it works

3170.559 --> 3175.28
like i'm the kind of weirdo guy that can

3173.28 --> 3176.4
be with a programmer and then the

3175.28 --> 3178.96
programmer is

3176.4 --> 3180.8
really good at what he does but he finds

3178.96 --> 3183.839
some kind of obstacle some kind of

3180.8 --> 3184.4
problem well if they actually are open

3183.839 --> 3187.68
enough

3184.4 --> 3188.96
to me then they can relay their problem

3187.68 --> 3190.72
and then even though i'm not a

3188.96 --> 3193.599
programmer i can

3190.72 --> 3194.0789999999997
actually find solutions and i have done

3193.599 --> 3198.88
this

3194.079 --> 3202.2400000000002
in the past i have i can do it

3198.88 --> 3205.28
this is my unique skill can dive

3202.24 --> 3208.5589999999997
into somebody else and then fix

3205.28 --> 3209.599
it even though it's not even my

3208.559 --> 3213.0400000000004
profession

3209.599 --> 3216.319
i have done this in the past

3213.04 --> 3217.599
it's always very amazed by it that that

3216.319 --> 3220.64
works

3217.599 --> 3223.3590000000004
it gave me such a broad look

3220.64 --> 3224.48
without the wearing down training to

3223.359 --> 3226.72
assimilate it all

3224.48 --> 3229.599
i could just have a temporary full

3226.72 --> 3231.2799999999997
spectrum insight temporary

3229.599 --> 3233.6800000000003
and that would give me a broader

3231.28 --> 3235.0400000000004
spectrum insight at the structure of all

3233.68 --> 3238.5589999999997
things

3235.04 --> 3239.2799999999997
just by flashes flashes of dealing with

3238.559 --> 3242.2400000000002
things

3239.28 --> 3242.2400000000002
it's pretty amazing

3248.72 --> 3253.04
right so yeah finding solutions

3251.52 --> 3264.24
solutions is really

3253.04 --> 3266.48
a passion of mine

3264.24 --> 3268.64
crack down on wrong think we'll destroy

3266.48 --> 3273.2
any independent thinking

3268.64 --> 3278.799
no but it will discourage it with the

3273.2 --> 3280.8799999999997
with the sheeps though

3278.799 --> 3281.839
but it will look the more crackdown on

3280.88 --> 3283.92
wrong think

3281.839 --> 3286.5589999999997
the more passionate the people defending

3283.92 --> 3289.839
against it will get

3286.559 --> 3293.8390000000004
and passion actually creates things so

3289.839 --> 3293.839
on the long term i think you're wrong

3298.799 --> 3303.7599999999998
like crack down on the internet on some

3301.599 --> 3307.4
kind of form of speech

3303.76 --> 3310.88
it doesn't really work it just causes a

3307.4 --> 3310.88
compartmentalization effect

3314.96 --> 3318.88
where different groups with different

3316.799 --> 3320.0
opinions simply will no longer be

3318.88 --> 3321.599
informed about each other

3320.0 --> 3323.68
that's where it leads to it doesn't

3321.599 --> 3335.839
actually stop it

3323.68 --> 3335.839
either side

3337.2 --> 3340.799
oh my god you're asking the same

3339.28 --> 3344.4
question again

3340.799 --> 3348.799
amen is that your job

3344.4 --> 3352.559
the copy paste that specific question

3348.799 --> 3353.119
in chats is that your job do you get

3352.559 --> 3356.7200000000003
paid

3353.119 --> 3360.799
to do that or is that really the best

3356.72 --> 3362.8799999999997
that you can do copy paste the same

3360.799 --> 3364.88
thing over and over again even though

3362.88 --> 3366.48
it has been answered in detail many

3364.88 --> 3377.839
times

3366.48 --> 3377.839
is that the only thing you can do mn

3385.04 --> 3391.839
ah man

3420.64 --> 3435.52
right foul and cannon

3433.119 --> 3437.839
but but there's also more weird stuff

3435.52 --> 3441.119
going on mechanically

3437.839 --> 3441.839
on the statistical level when it comes

3441.119 --> 3444.2400000000002
to people

3441.839 --> 3445.2799999999997
and their expressions and then the the

3444.24 --> 3447.68
wrong think

3445.28 --> 3448.4
crackdown because a lot of people were

3447.68 --> 3450.8799999999997
sort of like

3448.4 --> 3451.52
publicly [ __ ] and like go with it and

3450.88 --> 3455.28
then they

3451.52 --> 3458.079
try to uphold that right guess what it's

3455.28 --> 3461.28
unnatural so they are going to

3458.079 --> 3463.6800000000003
gather up certain types of tensions

3461.28 --> 3464.96
based on needs they can't express

3463.68 --> 3469.5989999999997
anymore

3464.96 --> 3471.68
so on the long run it's

3469.599 --> 3473.119
it's gonna try to find a way through

3471.68 --> 3476.16
somehow anyway

3473.119 --> 3478.319
so even people that seem to be part of

3476.16 --> 3478.319
the

3480.16 --> 3487.44
yeah the freedom of speech crack down

3484.88 --> 3488.0
even they have needs that eventually

3487.44 --> 3490.88
will try

3488.0 --> 3490.88
to find a way through

3491.28 --> 3497.6800000000003
so yeah can't really stop that

3494.72 --> 3498.48
can't really stop stop free expression

3497.68 --> 3501.9199999999996
you can only

3498.48 --> 3504.16
effectively compartmentalize it prevent

3501.92 --> 3506.2400000000002
others from seeing it

3504.16 --> 3517.839
but if things are not expressed it's

3506.24 --> 3517.839
going to cause damage

3520.4 --> 3524.48
all right i think i'm gonna round out

3521.92 --> 3531.839
the show soon

3524.48 --> 3531.839
it's been pretty good

3562.559 --> 3565.599
okay see you later steven traveler yeah

3564.799 --> 3568.88
a

3565.599 --> 3572.0
good question for olan buchanan

3568.88 --> 3575.599
cave art why did they do it to hide

3572.0 --> 3578.319
it maybe it could be that

3575.599 --> 3579.28
when the yeah using depictions and

3578.319 --> 3582.079
expressions

3579.28 --> 3583.76
when that was being developed by some

3582.079 --> 3585.44
that they were considered a threat

3583.76 --> 3588.6400000000003
because they could

3585.44 --> 3590.16
basically cause people to get stuck in a

3588.64 --> 3594.0
story fascination

3590.16 --> 3594.0
right and that would detract away from

3594.24 --> 3600.8799999999997
like more autocratic power so

3597.44 --> 3603.2000000000003
very well that artist even way

3600.88 --> 3604.0
in just ancient past whatever that was

3603.2 --> 3607.04
like

3604.0 --> 3609.839
more primitive times if any

3607.04 --> 3610.319
that they would have to go to caves that

3609.839 --> 3614.16
weren't

3610.319 --> 3617.7599999999998
like publicly wandered into a lot

3614.16 --> 3619.68
to just yeah express their art

3617.76 --> 3622.3190000000004
because if they did it in public they

3619.68 --> 3624.0789999999997
would be persecuted by their leaders

3622.319 --> 3626.0
could be well it doesn't even have to

3624.079 --> 3627.28
have to do with the content of their art

3626.0 --> 3628.96
it's just that

3627.28 --> 3631.44
art might have just simply been

3628.96 --> 3633.92
forbidden by autocratic

3631.44 --> 3635.359
autocratic tyranny in general like any

3633.92 --> 3637.92
form of expression of it

3635.359 --> 3637.92
who knows

3638.559 --> 3643.8390000000004
but it is a possibility

3649.44 --> 3654.48
flat earth is broke send cash fundies uh

3654.559 --> 3659.8390000000004
yeah sure donate to my paypal indeed

3658.079 --> 3663.2000000000003
not entirely broke though but i can

3659.839 --> 3663.2
definitely use the support

3664.64 --> 3671.839
for now

3690.96 --> 3699.839
right yeah good take a hike

3710.839 --> 3714.799
hey maybe for the same reason we haven't

3713.52 --> 3718.079
picked us on the wall but

3714.799 --> 3723.28
why would people live

3718.079 --> 3723.28
in caves like really live there

3724.16 --> 3727.839
unless they were hiding

3728.88 --> 3741.839
you know

3764.24 --> 3768.64
right so anyway thanks everyone for

3767.92 --> 3770.4
