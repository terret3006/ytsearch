37.47 --> 45.04
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

41.02 --> 46.84
early-bird number 300 I'm your host

45.04 --> 48.73
Arwen and before I start the show please

46.84 --> 50.59
don't forget to share it on any platform

48.73 --> 53.26
idiom fit and also if you haven't

50.59 --> 54.82000000000001
already subscribed to my channel and hit

53.26 --> 56.44
the vel notification so you know when

54.82 --> 59.559
I'm going live which is normally 2:00

56.44 --> 61.809
p.m. amsterdam time every day also

59.559 --> 65.77
please support my show through the

61.809 --> 69.66
paypal patreon my GoFundMe and the super

65.77 --> 75.58
chats that would be much appreciated so

69.66 --> 81.78999999999999
welcome everyone today is a beautiful

75.58 --> 87.88
day and the sun is shining and I feel

81.79 --> 95.02000000000001
good and probably nobody is gonna stop

87.88 --> 97.03
me now yay yeah it's beautiful when the

95.02 --> 99.759
clouds get in front of the Sun it gets a

97.03 --> 103.77
little chilly but it's just a beautiful

99.759 --> 103.77
day and yeah awesome

109.999 --> 112.999
right

114.21 --> 120.66
no before I engage in some real full-out

117.39 --> 123.09
singing I I need to practice that [ __ ]

120.66 --> 129.3
because I'm basically just fooling

123.09 --> 131.25
around now episode 300 indeed um in a

129.3 --> 131.64000000000001
way as you saw I got Tamera coffee with

131.25 --> 142.53
me

131.64 --> 144.77999999999997
tea that's it good enough for me Spartan

142.53 --> 148.82
chair yeah a helmet like that that will

144.78 --> 148.82
be kind of cool I don't have one though

149.959 --> 163.83
the cool helmet is always nice yeah

156.83 --> 170.38000000000002
right so let's see who isn't yet so a GM

163.83 --> 172.56
was first and then Steve I think right

170.38 --> 174.89

thirty-one watching already nice welcome

204.35 --> 219.95
IRA I kill dope right hmm so yeah I need

212.24 --> 222.95000000000002
to gather my concentration because I

219.95 --> 226.64
completely forgot about the 300th

222.95 --> 230.0
episode I just completely forgot to

226.64 --> 233.51
really make something special special

230.0 --> 240.23
out of it I may have been able to gather

233.51 --> 246.35
some people together but yeah it's been

240.23 --> 252.38
a busy night yesterday I kept on pretty

246.35 --> 258.96999999999997
late watching Randy's and it was good it

252.38 --> 258.96999999999997
was very interesting yeah

260.15 --> 267.92999999999995
tony was on their sleeping warrior

263.539 --> 272.28
anthony righty and he went up against

267.93 --> 274.949
toady and then some other ballers also

272.28 --> 283.229
kind of popped by there was some hassle

274.949 --> 284.729
going on but yeah toady just the stupid

283.229 --> 286.62
thing is I don't even remember the

284.729 --> 290.21999999999997
details because it was really high and

286.62 --> 292.44
stuff and I did muster the concentration

290.22 --> 296.66900000000004
back then but yeah I've been sleeping

292.44 --> 298.8
and I don't even remember the absolute

296.669 --> 301.289
details about I think it was concerning

298.8 --> 303.599
gravity it was concerning all kinds of

301.289 --> 306.69
things and it very typical

303.599 --> 313.71
oh yeah the scientific method about that

306.69 --> 316.949
my god the end and the or that the thing

313.71 --> 321.10999999999996
and again it came up like yeah and can

316.949 --> 326.28000000000003
also mean or because toady's source

321.11 --> 328.56
didn't didn't say or and or because he

326.28 --> 331.979
again wanted to stick to observation it

328.56 --> 335.479
was it was really good it was a really

331.979 --> 335.479
good show from Randy's

338.47 --> 346.95000000000005
yeah yeah but because of that I went to

342.76 --> 346.95
bed late and now I'm pretty late

352.34 --> 357.71
besides most of my focus really has been

355.46 --> 363.04999999999995
on my DD and kind of like building

357.71 --> 368.21
armies and now I just got interesting

363.05 --> 370.1
comes at concepts together and I still

368.21 --> 375.68
got like three weeks to work on it but

370.1 --> 377.51000000000005
I'm just already building stuff because

375.68 --> 379.90000000000003
I don't know I just have inspiration for

377.51 --> 379.9
it right now

383.35 --> 396.22
TV del on TV T that's that hello Randy

389.81 --> 396.22
good morning good afternoon for you

400.68 --> 406.38
right proficient pirate semantics do

403.08 --> 409.4
matter and means and indeed doesn't mean

406.38 --> 409.4
and /or

421.51 --> 426.52
okay trolls for sister i I've never even

424.48 --> 432.36
watched troll sirs as trolls I have no

426.52 --> 444.06
idea is that like a ball or hive hangout

432.36 --> 444.06
sounds like it what is that

451.87 --> 454.86
okay

463.58 --> 477.28999999999996
del against the Jason of the district

469.57 --> 480.74
what he on the streets oh my god oh [ __ ]

477.29 --> 484.40000000000003
I thought you were talking about just

480.74 --> 491.54
some hangout they actually faced off in

484.4 --> 495.79999999999995
the streets what happened did he go off

491.54 --> 498.46000000000004
the rails ooh am I kidding it's Dell of

495.8 --> 498.46000000000004
course he did

502.05 --> 504.889
mmm

505.49 --> 513.49
oh really he's gonna do that Tony

508.49 --> 513.49
against professor feel bail tonight cool

527.48 --> 537.529
huh

529.88 --> 540.9399999999999
now Brian leek now the thing is when

537.529 --> 543.86
concerning lights suppose the test to

540.94 --> 547.5790000000001
figure out if light is a particle the

543.86 --> 551.8100000000001
type of light they use is very narrow in

547.579 --> 554.0889999999999
its spectrum specifically just for that

551.81 --> 557.5999999999999
test because normally full spectrum

554.089 --> 560.5400000000001
daylight for example has all the spectra

557.6 --> 567.0790000000001
in it including infrared which is mostly

560.54 --> 572.329
heat and ultraviolet and and even more

567.079 --> 575.42
so it I'm pretty sure it can't be heat

572.329 --> 578.06
instead of particles but look the whole

575.42 --> 582.8
idea that light is particles and the

578.06 --> 588.2299999999999
experiment to show that is based um well

582.8 --> 591.079
just the interaction of light not

588.23 --> 594.529
presuming what it is necessarily with

591.079 --> 599.2589999999999
the matter that is the cause of the

594.529 --> 602.569
registry of it so in this matter will

599.259 --> 606.259
respond as soon as the amount of light

602.569 --> 608.649
energy because I'm firstly yeah it is

606.259 --> 612.8000000000001
energy as soon as that reaches death

608.649 --> 614.42
molecules critical mass for it to start

612.8 --> 617.149
switching to start triggering and

614.42 --> 619.819
however that the side effects whatever

617.149 --> 622.31
they are they may have a slight

619.819 --> 624.38
cascading effect locally to other

622.31 --> 628.16
molecules and that maybe cause of the

624.38 --> 630.829
blip as it were so that blip is

628.16 --> 632.8389999999999
basically a reaction based on the

630.829 --> 637.67
response of the molecule so you can't

632.839 --> 639.889
and in yeah that's complex for starters

637.67 --> 644.99
but also then you have the issue with

639.889 --> 648.199
light with the molecule right it's so

644.99 --> 650.509
going to be bound to the size of the

648.199 --> 655.0999999999999
molecule because molecules presumably

650.509 --> 657.7090000000001
have sizes it's kind of being deduced so

655.1 --> 660.96
there is at least some data that would

657.709 --> 663.93
indicate that they have specific sizes

660.96 --> 666.529
so these molecules that are then being

663.93 --> 670.9799999999999
used for the registry of the light

666.529 --> 675.06
particle supposedly they will be bound

670.98 --> 677.3100000000001
to their size so technically if the

675.06 --> 680.25
exact same type of molecule but much

677.31 --> 685.41
smaller could be utilized then perhaps

680.25 --> 688.14
the whole particle turn out the registry

685.41 --> 690.029
of it of the light will show much more

688.14 --> 692.13
detail the different type of pattern who

690.029 --> 694.43
knows what will come out of it may even

692.13 --> 697.95
look slightly fractal like or whatever

694.43 --> 700.17
just science fiction in it at this point

697.95 --> 703.2900000000001
but yeah because there probably aren't

700.17 --> 706.62
smaller molecules to do that the thing

703.29 --> 713.12
is is there is no reason at this point

706.62 --> 716.07
to assume that light is invisible that

713.12 --> 718.32
and that is a thing about particles the

716.07 --> 721.23
particle nature just like with molecules

718.32 --> 724.2900000000001
and atoms basically states that it has a

721.23 --> 727.41
minimum invisible size that's what makes

724.29 --> 729.93
a particle and that is what the kind of

727.41 --> 732.3299999999999
it implies with the claim of being a

729.93 --> 738.15
particle that's invisible in nature and

732.33 --> 743.6700000000001
I have I have not seen any true proof of

738.15 --> 745.56
that not that part because there are all

743.67 --> 747.27
kinds of indications even with the

745.56 --> 748.7399999999999
Registry's that there's just like

747.27 --> 751.709
aberrations all over the place

748.74 --> 756.42
indicating that well light may be just

751.709 --> 759.42
so infinitely divisible small and and

756.42 --> 763.29
break bendable and all that kind of it

759.42 --> 766.74
may be so small that cannot be defined

763.29 --> 768.66
how small it is but it will simply build

766.74 --> 771.089
up depending on the amount of energy

768.66 --> 773.37
that has been inputted in the in the

771.089 --> 776.6400000000001
source of what created the light in the

773.37 --> 781.26
first place or what unleashed the ether

776.64 --> 784.77
in in on the light frequency if you want

781.26 --> 786.66
to see it like that so I I am basically

784.77 --> 790.709
assuming right now that light is not

786.66 --> 792.6999999999999
particles that it's rather beams because

790.709 --> 794.7689999999999
that kind of helps

792.7 --> 798.13
it doesn't even matter if it would be a

794.769 --> 800.62
particle a blob or a beam because it

798.13 --> 806.62
does have a velocity apparently there is

800.62 --> 808.8100000000001
a speed so it seems but yeah it's not

806.62 --> 812.68
like a molecule you can't compare to

808.81 --> 815.8499999999999
molecule if anything if you insist on it

812.68 --> 821.26
being some kind of blob of energy then

815.85 --> 825.22
it is like a blob rather like a raindrop

821.26 --> 827.529
of light energy that is my potentially

825.22 --> 829.5400000000001
much much smaller it could be divided up

827.529 --> 831.79
much much smaller but devices would

829.54 --> 834.37
simply not be able to register it

831.79 --> 839.529
because they are bound to the sizes of

834.37 --> 843.63
molecules that is my yeah my biggest

839.529 --> 843.63
point concerning the whole issue

848.629 --> 856.8000000000001
right Cleary well fireflies create

852.99 --> 863.42
chemicals that have a fluorescent effect

856.8 --> 863.42
that give off light so yeah

869.26 --> 873.49
whether it's chemically induced or

871.48 --> 875.2
electrically induced and by the way

873.49 --> 882.21
fires also chemically induced

875.2 --> 882.21
technically fire is a chemical reaction

882.69 --> 891.4200000000001
yeah it is going to unleash the ether

886.63 --> 891.42
and create light

898.18 --> 904.2399999999999
anyway that is a conceptualized

901.74 --> 907.779
visualization for me for now because I

904.24 --> 909.64
think there is something to it just need

907.779 --> 913.15
to find it I I don't know maybe this is

909.64 --> 916.9
just a new the ethereal thing I'm trying

913.15 --> 921.76
to grasp at how high up there on the

916.9 --> 924.67
tier of what things could be but it

921.76 --> 926.26
seems a viable way to visualize it for

924.67 --> 929.4599999999999
me

926.26 --> 929.46
[Music]

936.06 --> 939.06
so

941.339 --> 952.9490000000001
double slit but I do like well the weird

945.54 --> 955.56
thing is the double slit experiment it's

952.949 --> 959.939
two different things the double slit

955.56 --> 963.6289999999999
experiment is not it's kind of like the

959.939 --> 968.79
setup but what is supposedly done with

963.629 --> 971.6700000000001
that it's not the knower alteration the

968.79 --> 974.759
nowhere path alteration effect that's

971.67 --> 977.2489999999999
something else so every times people

974.759 --> 979.379
address that effect and the application

977.249 --> 983.61
of that supposedly in technology it

979.379 --> 986.61
doesn't exist but what was learned from

983.61 --> 988.92
the double slit experiment is the

986.61 --> 992.97
diffractive properties of light of

988.92 --> 995.37
patterns of the path of light and what's

992.97 --> 998.009
so funny about that is you can assume

995.37 --> 1000.74
that it's molecules or like it's

998.009 --> 1004.4590000000001
particles were going this way but

1000.74 --> 1007.4300000000001
because of the refractive like it it's

1004.459 --> 1011.149
an index kind of thing the effect its

1007.43 --> 1013.54
index it's not dependent on a singular

1011.149 --> 1017.24
unit it's not Newtonian like in nature

1013.54 --> 1021.41
you can definitely just unleash it yeah

1017.24 --> 1023.629
it infinitely divisible beams on that

1021.41 --> 1029.089
concept as well and it'll work work

1023.629 --> 1033.079
perfectly it's no problem so it's rather

1029.089 --> 1035.87
they learned so much about the nature of

1033.079 --> 1039.86
light from the double slit experiment

1035.87 --> 1042.649
and then they apply that oh yes they did

1039.86 --> 1045.4699999999998
with all that knowledge of light they

1042.649 --> 1047.899
infuse that in an electronics they

1045.47 --> 1050.21
figured out certain patterns and then

1047.899 --> 1054.32
when they would tinker with the

1050.21 --> 1057.98
technology a leash electricity in

1054.32 --> 1059.75
certain ways yeah then they could make

1057.98 --> 1062.27
things more efficient and they have

1059.75 --> 1063.53
weird modulation effects I don't even

1062.27 --> 1065.4189999999999
know what I'm talking about here I'm not

1063.53 --> 1067.34
an electronics expert what they had

1065.419 --> 1072.0490000000002
effects that they could use those

1067.34 --> 1073.27
patterns for so yes but that is not the

1072.049 --> 1076.6
knower effect

1073.27 --> 1078.55
I technically if you just think about it

1076.6 --> 1082.36
from a philosophical angle there is no

1078.55 --> 1084.8799999999999
way to even utilize that effect it's

1082.36 --> 1086.559
weird enough if it could have truly been

1084.88 --> 1092.2900000000002
discovered in the first place because

1086.559 --> 1097.09
attention changes things and that also

1092.29 --> 1099.49
accounts for machines that you will

1097.09 --> 1101.74
check and by that creating the knower

1099.49 --> 1104.65
effects oh yeah

1101.74 --> 1106.929
the thing about Applied Technology it's

1104.65 --> 1110.98
usually meant for some kind of

1106.929 --> 1118.8600000000001
interaction otherwise what's the use of

1110.98 --> 1123.03
it so that that's just yeah anyway did

1118.86 --> 1128.6499999999999
the answer was never really given

1123.03 --> 1131.2
everybody must have heard and I'm still

1128.65 --> 1138.16
waiting kind of for it but they don't

1131.2 --> 1141.07
feel like addressing it seems anyway so

1138.16 --> 1143.02
yeah call it quantum mechanics I think

1141.07 --> 1146.62
that quantum mechanics is rather like

1143.02 --> 1149.95
the the name they'd like to give it

1146.62 --> 1151.6
because they found such weird effects so

1149.95 --> 1153.76
they're naming it after weird effects

1151.6 --> 1156.6999999999998
but not after the true material they're

1153.76 --> 1161.52
really learning they learned about it's

1156.7 --> 1161.52
rather yeah

1164.26 --> 1173.57
optical sciences you could call it or

1169.0 --> 1177.16
sciences of light sciences of energy

1173.57 --> 1177.1599999999999
that kind of thing

1185.14 --> 1191.2
but quantum mechanics implies so much it

1188.799 --> 1194.47
implies the whole presuppositional

1191.2 --> 1196.809
structure of particles and being it the

1194.47 --> 1199.299
tooth places the same all the weird

1196.809 --> 1203.83
stuff that comes from that from all

1199.299 --> 1206.549
these line of assumptions so yeah that's

1203.83 --> 1206.549
what they named it

1213.64 --> 1223.6000000000001
oh cool mark Sargent is now with the

1217.24 --> 1229.29
globe lie what really I thought you said

1223.6 --> 1229.29
we're gonna say with globe light tour I

1230.23 --> 1234.9
I don't think so Ragnar Stefan l-listen

1253.79 --> 1257.32
right I thought so

1261.54 --> 1268.53
yeah reckoner self and how this in the

1264.15 --> 1272.73
set that put that sentence together in a

1268.53 --> 1276.59
very well accidentally suggestive manner

1272.73 --> 1276.59
all right hmm

1276.68 --> 1281.03
okay curious to see that

1299.16 --> 1311.8200000000002
oh cool yeah yes okay it's not monetized

1307.2 --> 1318.44
right I would kind of like to stream

1311.82 --> 1318.4399999999998

if you're coming into this don't come

1439.86 --> 1447.03
into it just on the side either facet

1441.39 --> 1468.6000000000001
check both sides out way up oh yeah by

1447.03 --> 1472.1299999999999
the way guys I've tried that I've told

1468.6 --> 1472.1299999999999

1641.46 --> 1664.53
particular CEO this division of this

1664.53 --> 1667.79
number one we're being seemed camera

1668.45 --> 1673.3500000000001

[Music]

1710.37 --> 1719.34

too bad I wasn't there for the before

1726.13 --> 1730.24

I bet that was must have been hilarious

1730.24 --> 1746.5
I I do find elf very funny just I don't

1733.69 --> 1750.6000000000001
know probably not intended but yeah that

1746.5 --> 1750.6
was pretty cool

1754.79 --> 1765.61
it's also a pretty nifty looking suit

1758.559 --> 1765.61
more exciting news that has all know hey

1778.91 --> 1790.3200000000002
and their owner they go there yeah yeah

1787.559 --> 1792.8899999999999
we kinda know what's been going on you

know yeah

1809.869 --> 1813.789
got some real winners there

1825.08 --> 1836.4499999999998
now but I think look it's it's still

1829.43 --> 1838.64
kind of early you know so probably after

1836.45 --> 1845.06
I don't know how long they hang around

1838.64 --> 1848.3300000000002
there but probably after say five after

1845.06 --> 1852.4299999999998
four o'clock that's when a lot of people

1848.33 --> 1855.1399999999999
start to go out to stores and stuff so

1852.43 --> 1857.93
no wrecking our staff and he'll listen

1855.14 --> 1861.0700000000002
I did not see Marx commercial I have no

1857.93 --> 1861.0700000000002
idea what you're talking about

1884.34 --> 1888.5
take it it's on this channel

1902.4 --> 1909.2900000000002
I can't see it there or I don't know

1907.2 --> 1912.559
where to look

1909.29 --> 1912.559
all right

1924.54 --> 1927.54
okay

1943.73 --> 1949.3700000000001

1947.48 --> 1951.6100000000001
regular stuff and how listen is talking

1949.37 --> 1951.61

[Music]

1973.96 --> 1976.96
what

1979.18 --> 1986.73
new iPhone app it's foolproof are you

1983.77 --> 1986.73
sure that's the one

1989.419 --> 1997.3890000000001
right okay anyway yeah can I show this

1993.979 --> 1997.3890000000001
should I show this

2002.0 --> 2006.71
okay yeah you know what it's a

2004.88 --> 2009.65
commercial if they're gonna strike me

2006.71 --> 2010.43
for showing their commercial then

2009.65 --> 2012.74
they're nuts

2010.43 --> 2025.6100000000001
okay I guess I'll show it I hope it's

2012.74 --> 2028.64
not indecent fools they are everywhere

2025.61 --> 2032.6299999999999
teeth not a compliment and they come in

2028.64 --> 2034.2800000000002
all shapes and sizes who better to test

2032.63 --> 2036.5600000000002
the new foolproof iPhone app from

2034.28 --> 2039.32
Sportsbet than these Einsteins I

2036.56 --> 2041.21
personally believe that apps like such a

2039.32 --> 2045.74
sports bit they make it easier for

2041.21 --> 2048.05
people to use such as yep it's so easy

2045.74 --> 2049.55
even Botox Bradley here can use it

2048.05 --> 2051.3500000000004
without raising in our brain I'll never

2049.55 --> 2053.63
bought your head to head again and you

2051.35 --> 2055.43
make it look so natural Carol here

2053.63 --> 2057.38
thinks she's about to inherit a Nigerian

2055.43 --> 2059.4199999999996
fortune you know laughs Martin come easy

2057.38 --> 2062.1800000000003
but sports bets new iPhone apps sure

2059.42 --> 2064.85
does good to be true I like your

2062.18 --> 2066.98
imaginary Prince seriously even flat

2064.85 --> 2068.87
earth expert mark Sargent could use it a

2066.98 --> 2071.3
bloke who thinks spices I can do this

2068.87 --> 2074.12
standing on my head thanks gravity even

2071.3 --> 2079.82
this idiot abroad can use it yeah it's

2074.12 --> 2082.31
dead easy and we gotta save those people

2079.82 --> 2084.02
by making them learn about things the

2082.31 --> 2085.7599999999998
mighty they don't know I'll tell you

2084.02 --> 2087.2599999999998
what I do know even the permanently

2085.76 --> 2089.75
offended can claim a winner winner

2087.26 --> 2094.26
chicken or sorry vegan based dinner so

2089.75 --> 2097.21
easy so Regis it's a beauty

2094.26 --> 2099.7400000000002
[Music]

2097.21 --> 2101.6
it'll make a splash all right at least

2099.74 --> 2103.79
that's what former rugby league whiz kid

2101.6 --> 2107.0299999999997
Todd Carney will work yes it's a case of

2103.79 --> 2109.46
peace it's better when it's flat you

2107.03 --> 2111.6800000000003
should tap it right that's because

2109.46 --> 2115.38
they're not real things because Islands

2111.68 --> 2117.99
are not real jeiza seeds

2115.38 --> 2119.19
the OL new iPhone app from sports but

2117.99 --> 2124.8599999999997
it's foolproof

2119.19 --> 2126.08
brats fat hmm that was actually kind of

2124.86 --> 2133.4100000000003
clever

2126.08 --> 2136.77
that was that was dual wizardry that was

2133.41 --> 2140.67
interesting I like it that was very

2136.77 --> 2144.63
interesting they were kind of pulling it

2140.67 --> 2146.34
but at the same time kind of not doing

2144.63 --> 2151.02
that it was interesting that was

2146.34 --> 2156.86
fascinating that's a commercial that'll

2151.02 --> 2156.86
really make people like go like what huh

2157.25 --> 2166.91
that's interesting yeah no I'd even

2163.62 --> 2170.19
imagine why mark would be happy about it

2166.91 --> 2173.49
he wasn't made to look like an idiot he

2170.19 --> 2175.8
was kind of put in between a row where

2173.49 --> 2179.3999999999996
other people were clear actors being all

2175.8 --> 2182.04
stereotyped and he wasn't he was just

2179.4 --> 2185.42
trade forward Flat Earth I really liked

2182.04 --> 2185.42
it that was interesting man

2209.31 --> 2217.44
right boss spare me room music he

2213.15 --> 2222.2400000000002
doesn't need to with religious nut cases

2217.44 --> 2225.27
that will see him or any kind of

2222.24 --> 2227.64
association or openness about belief in

2225.27 --> 2230.39
Flat Earth instantly with idiocy yes

2227.64 --> 2233.73
that's correct for religious fanatics

2230.39 --> 2237.54
that around the globe side they don't

2233.73 --> 2241.98
need to see him make silly faces just

2237.54 --> 2245.88
the fact that he is openly being for

2241.98 --> 2253.64
Flat Earth and happily so is enough for

2245.88 --> 2257.06
them I know funny thing is though that a

2253.64 --> 2260.94
lot of globe religious fanatics

2257.06 --> 2265.02
overestimate how much of the people

2260.94 --> 2268.17
truly stand behind them they think just

2265.02 --> 2271.82
because there is an official consensus

2268.17 --> 2274.62
that that is the actual portrayal of how

2271.82 --> 2278.73
the first actual official percentage of

2274.62 --> 2285.12
what people really think inside a highly

2278.73 --> 2287.55
overestimated so people that aren't

2285.12 --> 2292.43
religiously fanatic they will be like

2287.55 --> 2292.4300000000003
what what is that

2347.91 --> 2355.7799999999997
all right Fyodor Dostoevsky but how did

2351.97 --> 2360.3399999999997
this exactly happen did an advertisement

2355.78 --> 2362.2000000000003
agency approached mark Sargent or did he

2360.34 --> 2365.7400000000002
explain it somewhere let's just start it

2362.2 --> 2366.8799999999997
like that but can imagine like if he

2365.74 --> 2369.8799999999997
paid for it

2366.88 --> 2374.59
they might that it's partly his

2369.88 --> 2380.82
advertisement that way or was he asked

2374.59 --> 2380.82
by an advertisement agency what happened

2403.17 --> 2411.449
yeah cool now that's that's awesome

2408.26 --> 2411.449
[Music]

2413.84 --> 2417.4100000000003
that's really cool

2425.15 --> 2432.06
yeah well you know Fyodor Dostoevsky the

2428.94 --> 2434.85
thing is again about flat earth and Marx

2432.06 --> 2439.47
art in and what he did in the way he

2434.85 --> 2445.25
does things he is kind of like a secret

2439.47 --> 2449.6699999999996
star because again a lot more people are

2445.25 --> 2453.36
not on the globe consensus a lot more

2449.67 --> 2456.12
than the globe fanatics think so there

2453.36 --> 2458.4300000000003
is still a lot of attention like a lot

2456.12 --> 2462.62
of people probably do know mark Sargent

2458.43 --> 2462.62
much more than we expect and

2462.74 --> 2469.83
advertisement agencies are not fooled by

2467.04 --> 2471.99
official consensus they know what's

2469.83 --> 2474.3199999999997
going on they have the research so they

2471.99 --> 2477.5099999999998
just probably saw them like wow okay

2474.32 --> 2480.57
apparently this guy is some weird secret

2477.51 --> 2484.38
underground star that's very nice very

2480.57 --> 2488.63
PC even so why not use him let's get

2484.38 --> 2488.63
risque I don't know it's interesting

2493.0 --> 2500.49
it's fascinating also encouraging that

2495.67 --> 2500.4900000000002
apparently you had that

2504.97 --> 2513.9399999999996
that it would eventually turn into that

2508.15 --> 2516.9700000000003
that's interesting and anyway mark

2513.94 --> 2520.329
Sargent did his absolute best for it as

2516.97 --> 2522.72
well you know he's been doing all this

2520.329 --> 2522.7200000000003
full-time

2529.29 --> 2535.369
Hey

2531.599 --> 2538.219
all right and a bear well you know what

2535.369 --> 2540.809
there are filters there are

2538.219 --> 2544.349
advertisement filters as well in place

2540.809 --> 2546.509
in some countries and with everything

2544.349 --> 2548.7290000000003
I've seen I'd say that Australia is

2546.509 --> 2555.38
probably one of the most censored

2548.729 --> 2559.229
countries now like full leftist control

2555.38 --> 2562.4100000000003
censorship and hammering down on gun

2559.229 --> 2564.749
ownership of any kind it's just it's

2562.41 --> 2566.069
really bad they have carbon taxes I

2564.749 --> 2567.8689999999997
don't know I've heard that there has

2566.069 --> 2570.839
been some move against it but I don't

2567.869 --> 2572.9100000000003
know if that actually succeeded but yeah

2570.839 --> 2576.479
they're cracking down hard over there so

2572.91 --> 2577.8289999999997
I wouldn't be surprised if if filters

2576.479 --> 2579.749
for that kind of thing on the internet

2577.829 --> 2582.2290000000003
are there so you just don't get

2579.749 --> 2587.779
advertisement with mark Sargent in them

2582.229 --> 2587.779
but who knows maybe it's just by chance

2605.19 --> 2612.14
all right yeah I know you are get out of

2609.93 --> 2612.14
here

2625.59 --> 2633.3900000000003
cracking down and tucking out really who

2630.37 --> 2633.39
were you talking about

2642.3 --> 2645.98
Doug Webb mark sergeant

2661.579 --> 2671.8900000000003
how rights right sorry my my bad yep

2667.059 --> 2671.8900000000003
cracking down and cocking out indeed

2674.84 --> 2687.7400000000002
the grabbers and the BRABUS got a a good

2678.5 --> 2689.57
grip there I'd say well yeah in the

2687.74 --> 2693.56
Netherlands they also have a grip but

2689.57 --> 2699.7400000000002
we've already gotten so far or rather so

2693.56 --> 2702.86
deep in in general that yeah there's not

2699.74 --> 2704.87
much more maneuvering room like most

2702.86 --> 2707.75
people are kind of really fed up with it

2704.87 --> 2713.63
and that's why y'all so the yellow fast

2707.75 --> 2716.53
movement and all that but yeah over here

2713.63 --> 2724.75
is also definitely grab ler and blättler

2716.53 --> 2724.75
country and they're very crafty here

2740.64 --> 2748.359
all right but that's a thing in supper

2743.949 --> 2751.15
traffic I'm arrests had and you can't

2748.359 --> 2753.88
necessarily take this as oh my god it's

2751.15 --> 2762.88
all evil air is just like what Owen

2753.88 --> 2765.969
Benjamin says but like like the there

2762.88 --> 2769.109
was just a kind of integration a long

2765.969 --> 2773.7690000000002
time ago I think that even the Dutch

2769.109 --> 2777.0389999999998
states has probably been involved with

2773.769 --> 2781.1189999999997
the grapplers a lot and there were and

2777.039 --> 2783.1890000000003
maybe yeah in a good way look banking is

2781.119 --> 2790.179
supposedly even invented in the

2783.189 --> 2793.479
Netherlands right so it's kind of those

2790.179 --> 2797.349
things have been woven in with a lot of

2793.479 --> 2799.269
Dutch traditions as it were so in a way

2797.349 --> 2801.279
we've been grabbing our country for a

2799.269 --> 2802.959
while and the Netherlands is not the

2801.279 --> 2807.159
only one Owen Benjamin also explains

2802.959 --> 2813.5789999999997
like in Italy in general also especially

2807.159 --> 2818.2290000000003
if Venice of course which is the origin

2813.579 --> 2820.869
of Phoenicia and so there are multiple

2818.229 --> 2824.8799999999997
places everywhere but yeah I'm noticing

2820.869 --> 2824.88
that a lot about the Netherlands that

2826.14 --> 2837.8799999999997
it's just not looked down upon to be to

2834.369 --> 2842.349
beyond the sense to be very tight on the

2837.88 --> 2844.3900000000003
wallet and and to be more focused on

2842.349 --> 2846.819
money it's kind of like woven in here

2844.39 --> 2851.2889999999998
and so there are because of this a lot

2846.819 --> 2856.14
of gravel errs and blabbers but not

2851.289 --> 2856.1400000000003
necessarily from any official

2858.99 --> 2863.4599999999996
yeah they're not really part of the big

2861.3 --> 2868.4100000000003
gang or anything even too much it just

2863.46 --> 2871.44
like to mingle in maybe even kind of

2868.41 --> 2873.72
like virtual signal pretend there's a

2871.44 --> 2876.599
lot of virtual signaling pretending

2873.72 --> 2880.3489999999997
going on also it very visible in the

2876.599 --> 2884.51
Dutch media I think because the Dutch

2880.349 --> 2884.51
happened to be kind of good at it I

2887.359 --> 2892.02
guess that maybe some kind of weird

2889.83 --> 2895.47
diplomatic nature or whatever you call

2892.02 --> 2897.9
it but yeah anyway there's also just

2895.47 --> 2901.4399999999996
yeah not everybody in the Netherlands

2897.9 --> 2905.04
even at the eye and is just all about

2901.44 --> 2909.66
grabbling only but they are they seem to

2905.04 --> 2911.73
be involved in almost everything but

2909.66 --> 2916.17
yeah then again if you look really

2911.73 --> 2918.39
careful with what country don't they but

2916.17 --> 2924.599
I don't know it's just I don't know how

2918.39 --> 2929.33
I even got to this subject Celie our

2924.599 --> 2929.3300000000004
fault rasa no it's not I brought it up

2935.63 --> 2941.15
yeah but in if you over if you over

2939.5 --> 2947.59
generalize you could say that the

2941.15 --> 2951.6800000000003
Netherlands is like partially crab Larry

2947.59 --> 2954.23
yeah it's part it's become part of the

2951.68 --> 2959.5099999999998
Netherlands identity as a way as it were

2954.23 --> 2968.93
and it's especially like the big city

2959.51 --> 2970.61
regions ah don't do that Rasta I'm not

2968.93 --> 2973.31
putting the block on that by the way I'm

2970.61 --> 2976.51
not even seeing it so it's not being

2973.31 --> 2979.69
held it's just not that must be Google

2976.51 --> 2979.69
doing that

2995.329 --> 3005.349
I should look for that that video the

3001.63 --> 3009.13
original video about the grabbers it

3005.349 --> 3013.409
wasn't made by own Benjamin so it should

3009.13 --> 3013.409
just I should be able to show it maybe

3020.569 --> 3029.049
yes yeah it was from the onion it was so

3026.719 --> 3029.049
cool

3032.09 --> 3038.26
this monetized

3035.35 --> 3041.43
well they have so many subscribers

3038.26 --> 3041.4300000000003
that's just crazy

3047.58 --> 3054.39
anyway you know what I'll just put out

3050.4 --> 3056.46
the link because it's it's just too good

3054.39 --> 3060.21
not to have seen this once in your life

3056.46 --> 3062.93
at least I also throw it in the

3060.21 --> 3062.93
earlybird chat

3075.27 --> 3077.93
yeah

3088.78 --> 3091.6800000000003
all right

3091.82 --> 3094.42
yeah

3095.08 --> 3101.0099999999998
so okay I talked a little flat earth

3103.08 --> 3113.61
yeah I'm kind of stuck guys the sketch

3109.57 --> 3113.61
for the gravel area is on point - yep

3139.29 --> 3143.94
hmm guys I'm gonna round out the show

3141.72 --> 3149.9599999999996
because I'm yeah I don't really know

3143.94 --> 3155.87
what to do and Nathan's already starting

3149.96 --> 3155.87
falls down in a forest is it still here

3165.3 --> 3175.69

3195.52 --> 3199.63
just tell us about the cat well doc

3197.65 --> 3206.819
Michel I haven't gotten the camera yet

3199.63 --> 3209.5
so yeah I'll just see that when I get it

3206.819 --> 3214.5589999999997
before that I'm it's no more not much

3209.5 --> 3214.559
used to start pondering on that

3223.03 --> 3232.0800000000004
Cal cking that's not the first time I

3225.97 --> 3232.08
heard that right

3236.28 --> 3244.5
all right Karen B well I did plan that

3239.52 --> 3247.53
for number three three three don't know

3244.5 --> 3261.349
what that exact plan is gonna be yet

3247.53 --> 3261.349
though I might also do a Bilbo we'll see

3266.05 --> 3274.19
all right well yeah jokey mokey Macedo I

3270.77 --> 3280.7
haven't gotten it yet but thanks it is

3274.19 --> 3284.54
at least a nice gesture and I'm kind of

3280.7 --> 3287.6899999999996
glad that variety is really seemingly

3284.54 --> 3294.62
putting some effort in mending things up

3287.69 --> 3295.87
and yeah I do appreciate that I am I am

3294.62 --> 3299.42
taking notice

3295.87 --> 3302.3599999999997
so anyway I am gonna run out the show so

3299.42 --> 3306.02
thanks everyone for coming and hashtag

3302.36 --> 3310.55
MIFA indeed album uncle if you like this

3306.02 --> 3311.24
show the special 300th episode whatever

3310.55 --> 3313.01
thought

3311.24 --> 3314.5099999999998
Arwen would have made it this far when

3313.01 --> 3318.5
he said he was gonna do a daily show

3314.51 --> 3320.78
right well I did because I knew like

3318.5 --> 3323.18
okay once I start this I'm literally

3320.78 --> 3327.1400000000003
gonna have severe problems quitting it

3323.18 --> 3330.1299999999997
even if I wanted to because once I start

3327.14 --> 3334.19
to build like a daily habit it's tough

3330.13 --> 3337.13
tough tough to break that very tough so

3334.19 --> 3339.23
even when I'm sick I'll just be like

3337.13 --> 3341.44
anxious if I wouldn't do the show even

3339.23 --> 3348.1
if I were sick and that happened before

3341.44 --> 3351.08
so anyway yeah I'm a creature of habit

3348.1 --> 3354.35
but anyway yeah if you did like the show
