38.02 --> 45.68000000000001
good morning welcome to flat earth

41.66 --> 50.3
early-bird number 151 I'm your host

45.68 --> 53.18
Arwen and today is a very clear and

50.3 --> 56.72
sunny day but it's kind of cold weirdly

53.18 --> 64.01
enough look at that

56.72 --> 69.16
oh yeah and check out wow it's a full

64.01 --> 72.47
bloom so incredibly pretty a very pink

69.16 --> 75.08
but still yeah the colors to see it with

72.47 --> 81.32
your own eyes it's pretty amazing or at

75.08 --> 84.71
least with my eyes and yeah it's still

81.32 --> 89.33
kind of fresh though there's a cold

84.71 --> 92.57
breeze coming from inland and yeah when

89.33 --> 95.39
it's not blowing it's very warm in the

92.57 --> 99.86
Sun but when it is blowing it's really

95.39 --> 102.13
fresh so how you all doing let's use in

99.86 --> 102.13
chat

108.81 --> 116.2
all right

111.56 --> 123.88
so hello Steve Juan Carlos Sanders ace

Karen B and Voynich good to see you all

144.85 --> 152.04999999999998
M Rick's J Mack IRA killed the hope oh

149.8 --> 158.09
nice

152.05 --> 164.9
right oh no guests planned for today

158.09 --> 167.989
although was this one guy mark or he

164.9 --> 173.75
asked if he could come on and I did give

167.989 --> 175.489
him a link but yeah last scene 20

173.75 --> 177.739
minutes ago on skype so I don't know if

175.489 --> 186.44
he's gonna pop by or not but that could

177.739 --> 193.91
be interesting so what's going on

186.44 --> 196.04
I did get to watch Owen Benjamin last

193.91 --> 197.57
evening or part of it and I'm watching

196.04 --> 199.989
like the first half of it now it's

197.57 --> 199.989
pretty good

202.57 --> 205.69899999999998
[Music]

206.03 --> 211.64000000000001
let's see oh yeah I finished that that

209.18 --> 212.45000000000002
series it was only one season apparently

211.64 --> 216.98
it's very new

212.45 --> 218.45
the Alienist and it was just like a

216.98 --> 226.60999999999999
serial killer

218.45 --> 230.51
murder investigation in like and 19th

226.61 --> 235.09
century late Victorian industrialized

230.51 --> 235.09
Age in its I don't know I find it very

236.8 --> 243.68
probably brutally accurate in a way like

240.77 --> 249.56
the conditions and what yeah what

243.68 --> 252.07
happened back then but it's it is kind

249.56 --> 252.07
of freaky

255.42 --> 262.019
yeah it's not not even her it's just

257.66 --> 264.93
societal degradation kind of

262.019 --> 267.78000000000003
overexposure to that that's what the

264.93 --> 271.77
series really is about its like societal

267.78 --> 276.919
degeneration basically a very open and

271.77 --> 276.919
upfront about it anyway

277.05 --> 285.15000000000003
yeah finished that that kind of a I

280.88 --> 293.57
don't know it wasn't all strong what was

285.15 --> 293.57
entertaining enough for me yeah

297.71 --> 303.02
oh yeah right and I started to do

300.199 --> 313.039
another Netflix thing it kind of popped

303.02 --> 317.479
on a very clear propaganda piece it's

313.039 --> 321.289
like an environmental miniseries again

317.479 --> 325.55
our planet and it's just as terrible as

321.289 --> 329.33
that sounds it starts out with oh we

325.55 --> 332.539
swim the moon-landing low so we can see

329.33 --> 337.06
the Earth from the moon seriously that's

332.539 --> 341.86
exactly how it starts out and yeah it is

337.06 --> 344.3
an interesting very beautifully filmed

341.86 --> 348.71000000000004
close-up look look

344.3 --> 350.90000000000003
- yeah the ecosystem especially in the

348.71 --> 356.78
polar regions and was very interesting

350.9 --> 360.88
also lots of ice for it's just very very

356.78 --> 364.46
beautiful crisp clear footage amazing

360.88 --> 366.86
quality content wise but yeah as for the

364.46 --> 369.56
narration goes it is kind of good to

366.86 --> 374.75
know but my god they dramatize an over

369.56 --> 377.659
politicize it's so so badly and it

374.75 --> 381.199
constantly like climate change and no

377.659 --> 383.03
it's caused by man and oh now look this

381.199 --> 384.889
is coming out of balance and how it

383.03 --> 387.28
doesn't have the opportunities it used

384.889 --> 393.11
to have because the climate changed and

387.28 --> 397.039
she's us that was like enough already

393.11 --> 399.83000000000004
can I just please enjoy the nature

397.039 --> 401.8
footage and just see what these

399.83 --> 405.83
creatures are doing because the climate

401.8 --> 408.32
changes naturally and they learn to

405.83 --> 412.58
adapt and it's fascinating to see what

408.32 --> 414.05
they figure out what they do and to just

412.58 --> 416.24
say oh they don't have this anymore

414.05 --> 418.94
they're now just weak no I'm much more

416.24 --> 421.61
curious as to what new strategy have

418.94 --> 424.12
these creatures found and yeah there

421.61 --> 428.15000000000003
were some pretty dramatic

424.12 --> 429.2
yeah gruesome things going on as well

428.15 --> 431.98999999999995
like

429.2 --> 435.53
seeing was that was kind of horrible I

431.99 --> 439.79
don't know the background of that but

435.53 --> 442.9
basically they suggested was it like

439.79 --> 448.15000000000003
certain sea lions or seagulls some kind

442.9 --> 451.60999999999996
that Eve would not have the normal eyes

448.15 --> 454.28
they would comfortably sit on and thus

451.61 --> 456.46000000000004
they pile up on this rock and then it

454.28 --> 459.73999999999995
was sometimes a stampede happens and

456.46 --> 462.68
like dozens of these creatures just

459.74 --> 467.6
tumble off the cliff that was pretty

462.68 --> 468.71
disgusting and tragic but my god like

467.6 --> 471.53000000000003
what is that

468.71 --> 475.58
I get the feeling they're manipulating

471.53 --> 477.72999999999996
me with this because you had weird [ __ ]

475.58 --> 481.27
like like lemmings jumping off cliffs

477.73 --> 483.62
like yeah these are just weird creature

481.27 --> 487.60999999999996
things they do it sometimes and I don't

483.62 --> 489.83
know they say they suggest at least that

487.61 --> 491.87
that never happened before in the past

489.83 --> 496.07
and it's only now happening because the

491.87 --> 499.46
ice doesn't form in the normal season

496.07 --> 503.93
blah blah and I just get the feeling I'm

499.46 --> 505.54999999999995
being manipulated I kind of I'm like

503.93 --> 507.89
getting this attitude like yeah that's

505.55 --> 511.94
pretty interesting but can I have the

507.89 --> 517.0
real data please that well that was my

511.94 --> 520.43
response to a lot of it so yeah great

517.0 --> 523.729
great photography great film footage but

520.43 --> 527.26
so manipulative it's it's not like the

523.729 --> 527.26
documentaries of the 90s anymore

531.31 --> 540.2589999999999
also you had reinforced diversity it's

535.699 --> 541.81
pretty freaky what's out there and I did

540.259 --> 545.24
they always bring in all the

541.81 --> 546.9699999999999
evolutionary balance and blah and I'm

545.24 --> 551.089
much more curious from a creation

546.97 --> 558.97
perspective it is like okay that was all

551.089 --> 562.8190000000001
created how did that manage to live

558.97 --> 566.3290000000001
through the ages and the rapid changes

562.819 --> 568.399
somehow because yeah world cataclysms

566.329 --> 572.5089999999999
and everything how did that manage to

568.399 --> 575.24
survive it all these bizarre specific

572.509 --> 582.74
type of creatures because I absolutely

575.24 --> 585.29
do not believe that yeah that these

582.74 --> 587.75
creatures totally evolved from another

585.29 --> 590.54
type of species into what they are right

587.75 --> 594.8
then I don't buy that right away i buy

590.54 --> 597.709
adaption so maybe I don't know maybe

594.8 --> 599.99
there are just certain types of plants

597.709 --> 604.9699999999999
that can pretty much transform

599.99 --> 608.199
themselves into yeah flesh-eating plants

604.97 --> 611.6600000000001
for example even weirder things like

608.199 --> 613.9699999999999
they constantly showed like they were

611.66 --> 615.68
especially fascinated and I have to

613.97 --> 617.69
agree I did find it fascinating as well

615.68 --> 622.76
like this special type of plants that

617.69 --> 627.4100000000001
would that would lure in either insects

622.76 --> 630.709
or creatures and they would yeah be like

627.41 --> 634.55
a comfortable portable toilet to them

630.709 --> 637.42
and that you would so funny like feed

634.55 --> 643.3389999999999
them sugar that the plants would excrete

637.42 --> 646.25
until yeah they poo and then that drops

643.339 --> 649.639
into a bucket and it's apparently a

646.25 --> 654.68
source of nitrogen fascinating but yeah

649.639 --> 657.019
my god either that creature would have

654.68 --> 660.89
been like that forever and somehow

657.019 --> 664.95
survived all the changes of nature or

660.89 --> 670.47
yeah it is derived from a certain plant

664.95 --> 673.8900000000001
type that can apparently adapt there at

670.47 --> 677.64
a very extreme range somehow or was

673.89 --> 681.6
allowed to at some point to do that it's

677.64 --> 683.52
it is miraculous to me it still have to

681.6 --> 686.46
take it into consideration with the

683.52 --> 688.76
creation angle and adaptation so yeah it

686.46 --> 694.82
was still very interesting if we could

688.76 --> 694.8199999999999
bypass the propaganda drama

702.19 --> 708.759
all right yeah there wasn't really even

705.91 --> 713.019
talk about dinosaurs or not a lot they

708.759 --> 715.089
didn't say ooh like sharks during and

713.019 --> 717.04
yeah referencing it mostly during the

715.089 --> 721.629
age of the dinosaurs but it wasn't like

717.04 --> 726.459
a Jurassic type it was really about

721.629 --> 728.5600000000001
current age animal life an ecosystem and

726.459 --> 730.66
that is what I find so interesting about

728.56 --> 739.7199999999999
it because this is yeah all this stuff

730.66 --> 741.91
is current and oh yeah

739.72 --> 744.61
and they also showed footage of krill

741.91 --> 748.769
and it was fascinating and even got me

744.61 --> 748.769
thinking again with my ecological

751.17 --> 757.54
ecological architecture I was thinking

754.42 --> 761.709
okay apparently what they suggested is

757.54 --> 766.779
that these krill hide underneath the ice

761.709 --> 769.18
cap of the Arctic right and then oh it

766.779 --> 771.189
melts away for too long and then they're

769.18 --> 774.3599999999999
exposed and creatures start hunting them

771.189 --> 776.92
what precaution to watch melts away

774.36 --> 778.4490000000001
apparently suggested like they're all

776.92 --> 780.149
going to die out or something I don't

778.449 --> 782.68
know they don't even say it but it just

780.149 --> 785.17
emphasized all that hunting so much in

782.68 --> 786.7589999999999
and then the trollers come in and fish

785.17 --> 794.5
for krill as well and they have to feel

786.759 --> 798.22
guilty about that of course when I was

794.5 --> 799.959
thinking like okay if that's such a

798.22 --> 806.769
problem that the ice is melting away

799.959 --> 809.41
maybe you could build artificial ice

806.769 --> 812.47
plateaus

809.41 --> 815.079
that even if things would warm up

812.47 --> 818.499
slightly would be like a localized

815.079 --> 821.649
refrigerator that just kept a chunk of

818.499 --> 824.639
ice frozen despite everything else

821.649 --> 827.589
melting and then maybe the krill would

824.639 --> 831.189
have these remaining platforms to hide

827.589 --> 833.739
under what about that we want to breathe

831.189 --> 840.879
seek real for all these creatures and

833.739 --> 843.0690000000001
ourselves why not do something instead

840.879 --> 847.149
of just forbidding us to do it because

843.069 --> 849.779
nature is still going to like yea feed

847.149 --> 853.779
it like dive in and feed it on at all

849.779 --> 855.819
like if if this really is a problem and

853.779 --> 858.729
the R is melting too much or something

855.819 --> 861.459
as they suggest whatever the cause may

858.729 --> 863.5590000000001
be is a problem yeah the rest of the

861.459 --> 867.069
fish is are going to eat all those krill

863.559 --> 871.1089999999999
then whether we do eat it or not but

867.069 --> 878.319
maybe we can provide some kind of yeah

871.109 --> 882.539
man-made platform to keep the yeah to

878.319 --> 882.539
keep them like a permanent safe ground a

882.629 --> 888.899
another another Iranian ecological idea

891.88 --> 897.06
right next to my artificial coral reef

894.49 --> 897.0600000000001
concept

906.45 --> 912.8000000000001
anyway some feedback would be good you

909.779 --> 912.8
guys care about that

924.57 --> 935.4000000000001
all right well DSM a mast DSA yeah it

932.94 --> 940.58
may not be the other problem but these

935.4 --> 945.8
are the the bottom of the ecological

940.58 --> 949.5300000000001
system type of problems and that means

945.8 --> 958.3199999999999
everything above it and humanity

949.53 --> 966.35
look I'm my ecology philosophy is

958.32 --> 970.4100000000001
basically based on I don't know how the

966.35 --> 976.23
cultivating nature without destroying it

970.41 --> 978.0899999999999
so it is not as drastic as like we

976.23 --> 980.97
cultivated cows and chickens and

978.09 --> 984.87
everything and they would become our

980.97 --> 987.0600000000001
yeah pets our cattle but rather just

984.87 --> 989.97
provides specific platforms to keep

987.06 --> 993.0
things going even though there are

989.97 --> 997.6800000000001
natural changes going on to keep the

993.0 --> 1003.74
ecology stable like making the world

997.68 --> 1006.5899999999999
into a giant zoo almost but yeah with

1003.74 --> 1009.65
sea life yeah things can get more dread

1006.59 --> 1012.2
there is more harvesting or potential

1009.65 --> 1015.86
for us as well so if we do that then

1012.2 --> 1018.8000000000001
yeah nature survives and we humans keep

1015.86 --> 1021.11
our feeding grounds as well so it's a

1018.8 --> 1023.06
win-win situation for both humanity and

1021.11 --> 1029.03
nature and that's why I believe this is

1023.06 --> 1032.03
just we must do these things and not be

1029.03 --> 1034.91
constantly driven insane with all the

1032.03 --> 1039.6499999999999
also your fault humanity co2

1034.91 --> 1041.3600000000001
blahblahblah industry no it's [ __ ]

1039.65 --> 1044.48
it's either a total lie

1041.36 --> 1046.04
or there is really barely anything we

1044.48 --> 1049.6100000000001
can do about it without destroying

1046.04 --> 1052.1
ourselves and that is just insane to

1049.61 --> 1056.2299999999998
pursue such a course so it's much better

1052.1 --> 1056.23
to help nature adapt

1062.42 --> 1068.45
that's my personal ecological philosophy

1069.85 --> 1072.8799999999999
[Music]

1079.84 --> 1086.51
and then we get I don't know we get good

1084.62 --> 1089.54
feelings about ourselves that we help

1086.51 --> 1091.61
save nature and we get more of these

1089.54 --> 1096.56
great footages people can feel happy

1091.61 --> 1098.6599999999999
about it and at the same time we still

1096.56 --> 1105.44
get to eat the good foods keeping us

1098.66 --> 1108.53
healthy and no panic because of this no

1105.44 --> 1112.13
people driving you insane because things

1108.53 --> 1115.46
are actually going good and yeah no less

1112.13 --> 1117.47
war because of that because war is yeah

1115.46 --> 1120.56
people underestimate the destructive

1117.47 --> 1123.89
force of war on nature it's the worst

1120.56 --> 1127.09
people start to do drastic things when

1123.89 --> 1131.75
war breaks out it's when horrifying

1127.09 --> 1134.72
sacrifices of nature are made by mankind

1131.75 --> 1138.92
during this time so you don't want that

1134.72 --> 1142.46
and in that sense the ecological

1138.92 --> 1146.1100000000001
liberals are just gone insane it's like

1142.46 --> 1149.45
different type of priorities that are

1146.11 --> 1151.61
allies but they're working so badly

1149.45 --> 1157.24
against each other yet they stay in

1151.61 --> 1157.24
cahoots it's crazy it's become insane

1167.11 --> 1176.08
alright the DSA I agree as a personal

1172.84 --> 1179.5
responsibility we should be more

1176.08 --> 1182.23
environmentally aware this is just the

1179.5 --> 1187.299
90s me this is how I've been raised and

1182.23 --> 1191.89
how I've maintained myself like this is

1187.299 --> 1194.11
I do that I'm I recycle and [ __ ] and I

1191.89 --> 1201.22
tried not to leave junk around I hate

1194.11 --> 1209.559
junk and avoid prefab products as much

1201.22 --> 1212.019
as possible yeah but that's just me it

1209.559 --> 1213.97
works better but yeah there's just a lot

1212.019 --> 1216.3700000000001
of people out there that just don't get

1213.97 --> 1226.409
that or they're very bad at it they're

1216.37 --> 1226.4089999999999
sloppy they don't have a focus but yeah

1227.3 --> 1234.3999999999999
we can work on it over time I think that

1231.65 --> 1239.3600000000001
some conditioning concerning being clean

1234.4 --> 1242.3000000000002
what do a lot of good if you don't yeah

1239.36 --> 1244.49
if you don't attack people with that and

1242.3 --> 1247.04
just set a normal right example through

1244.49 --> 1250.85
the media you know we used to do that

1247.04 --> 1253.76
and with the TV just set kind of normal

1250.85 --> 1256.73
decent behavior examples and now it's

1253.76 --> 1261.1299999999999
all attention grabby crazy and pushes

1256.73 --> 1261.13
[ __ ] sucks

1279.5 --> 1284.5
alright ok I'll stop talking about this

1282.13 --> 1287.5
huh

1284.5 --> 1287.5
Tikal

1289.92 --> 1292.959
[Music]

1300.39 --> 1304.3290000000002
[Music]

1314.09 --> 1327.72
yeah yeah Daniel that part and that

1322.89 --> 1329.46
theory of sunlight supposedly reflecting

1327.72 --> 1335.059
out of the atmosphere

1329.46 --> 1335.059
I find that concept pretty nonsensical I

1336.679 --> 1340.64
don't buy that at all

1350.14 --> 1355.14
besides if it's if it's truly that bad

1355.71 --> 1364.299
then well making ice refrigerator

1360.059 --> 1367.75
artificial ice platforms would only be

1364.299 --> 1370.74
logical to do if nature is not gonna

1367.75 --> 1377.23
allow that to happen anymore by itself

1370.74 --> 1381.33
so either way there's things we can do

1377.23 --> 1381.33
with design and industry

1385.07 --> 1388.1599999999999
[Music]

1390.2 --> 1395.43
but you know a project like this what I

1393.45 --> 1400.8300000000002
suggested a local ice platform

1395.43 --> 1404.55
refrigerator system well just try it out

1400.83 --> 1408.3799999999999
locally and one spot I don't know maybe

1404.55 --> 1411.75
you could get like a mile across a

1408.38 --> 1415.1100000000001
platform that keeps on being frozen all

1411.75 --> 1418.11
year long it might drift you may have to

1415.11 --> 1420.27
like anchor it as it were so that the

1418.11 --> 1422.52
does if everything is surrounding it

1420.27 --> 1425.43
would melt that it wouldn't wander off

1422.52 --> 1429.35
out in the open sea stay kind of locally

1425.43 --> 1433.3200000000002
stay localized and just see what happens

1429.35 --> 1437.52
if there is but if yeah Creole activity

1433.32 --> 1440.06
increases because of this let's start

1437.52 --> 1440.06
there

1445.27 --> 1451.31
yeah that's right Daniel

1448.13 --> 1457.97
but the funny thing is if you release

1451.31 --> 1460.4299999999998
the heat in the air above it yeah how

1457.97 --> 1465.53
much did that's not gonna have a huge

1460.43 --> 1469.3700000000001
amount of influence really and besides

1465.53 --> 1471.35
it's only gonna really affect things the

1469.37 --> 1474.5
moment that everything surrounding it

1471.35 --> 1479.86
heats up anyway because then it

1474.5 --> 1482.06
certainly has a lot of heat to exert and

1479.86 --> 1484.37
everything's around it is gonna be

1482.06 --> 1487.34
molten anyway so a little bit more warm

1484.37 --> 1491.0
air would it really matter that much

1487.34 --> 1492.9199999999998
it's not gonna do anything when it's

1491.0 --> 1495.29
frozen solid everything around it

1492.92 --> 1504.6100000000001
because it's just gonna be part of the

1495.29 --> 1504.61
ice sea I think it could work

1508.73 --> 1511.42
yeah

1522.2 --> 1534.1390000000001
now Daniel I'm not telling you

1527.08 --> 1538.509
completely misinterpret my idea it's a

1534.139 --> 1542.629
local ice platform it's not a thing to

1538.509 --> 1549.23
cool down the average temperature of the

1542.629 --> 1553.609
oceans although technically you could

1549.23 --> 1557.33
even do that you can just have certain

1553.609 --> 1560.9189999999999
coolers in very specific areas that are

1557.33 --> 1563.9189999999999
part of the stream and then if yeah

1560.919 --> 1570.5590000000002
unusually warm water passes through

1563.919 --> 1572.749
through that area then these coolers may

1570.559 --> 1575.4189999999999
give some extra cooling to that world

1572.749 --> 1579.59
that might even actually work as it an

1575.419 --> 1580.8500000000001
oceanic geoengineering concept but yeah

1579.59 --> 1582.859
is that safe

1580.85 --> 1585.4089999999999
I don't know my idea would have less

1582.859 --> 1587.1789999999999
influence on the general thing and would

1585.409 --> 1590.21
remain localized which would make it

1587.179 --> 1591.8300000000002
safe including to the for tempering but

1590.21 --> 1594.5900000000001
the worst could happen is that it would

1591.83 --> 1600.139
fail and yeah I would be a failure and

1594.59 --> 1604.539
just have one local ice platform and see

1600.139 --> 1604.539
what how nature responds to that

1608.59 --> 1617.299
I'm not talking about warming or cooling

1614.48 --> 1619.279
the oceans and but I'm basically only

1617.299 --> 1624.529
talking about Antarctic at this

1619.279 --> 1630.95
Antarctica that region because the North

1624.529 --> 1634.039
Pole I that's I don't know it seems kind

1630.95 --> 1638.3300000000002
of weird and senseless to do that why

1634.039 --> 1645.379
would you well yeah you know what maybe

1638.33 --> 1647.299
you could kind of do the same thing have

1645.379 --> 1651.1
some ice platforms there for the polar

1647.299 --> 1651.1
bears and the sealed

1656.35 --> 1659.2199999999998
I don't know

1661.79 --> 1667.77
okay

1663.81 --> 1672.0
well ridicule it all you like I think

1667.77 --> 1675.33
it's doable and I hope to see one day

1672.0 --> 1677.93
within my lifetime that yeah I'll have a

1675.33 --> 1686.6699999999998
chance to actually suggest it to

1677.93 --> 1688.91
somebody very serious and yeah could try

1686.67 --> 1688.91
it out

1700.91 --> 1706.63
don't be patronizing Daniel I know what

1703.82 --> 1706.6299999999999
a greenhouse is

1714.92 --> 1723.89
you know that in a greenhouse if you put

1720.5 --> 1725.36
like well let's just say because ice is

1723.89 --> 1728.21
not gonna work it's gonna melt very

1725.36 --> 1730.9099999999999
quickly okay but like aluminum foil to

1728.21 --> 1734.92
reflect all that light well guess what

1730.91 --> 1737.6000000000001
the greenhouse stills gonna go warm

1734.92 --> 1745.429
because the heat is trapped within the

1737.6 --> 1748.809
container mm-hmm it can't mix with the

1745.429 --> 1748.8090000000002
colder air outside

1755.11 --> 1761.399
that's right so I don't really see the

1758.919 --> 1761.3990000000001
relevance

1769.53 --> 1777.62
you know that green has houses are

1773.299 --> 1781.08
usually more deprived of co2 than

1777.62 --> 1784.559
everything outside it right cause all

1781.08 --> 1788.46
the plants inside it just absorb it all

1784.559 --> 1791.549
most of it so yeah it actually this is

1788.46 --> 1795.21
literally true it depends on either

1791.549 --> 1801.809
having open doors or human activity or

1795.21 --> 1806.73
animal activity to provide co2 this this

1801.809 --> 1811.74
whole thing about co2 it's such [ __ ]

1806.73 --> 1815.25
it's a total 180 degree insane story

1811.74 --> 1817.86
about greenhouse gases climate change

1815.25 --> 1823.76
gases man-made it's all on every level

1817.86 --> 1823.76
it's one of the worst worst lies ever

1827.72 --> 1833.8500000000001
yeah I I heard the [ __ ] theory don't

1831.12 --> 1836.9089999999999
bring it don't bring it here Candide I

1833.85 --> 1840.09
can't stand it okay I've been hearing

1836.909 --> 1842.7
that [ __ ] since the 90s from a few

1840.09 --> 1847.3799999999999
people it just makes me want to punch

1842.7 --> 1851.46
their faces in it's such [ __ ] it's

1847.38 --> 1853.74
total horseshit it's to me that's about

1851.46 --> 1857.6100000000001
as true and realistic as the freakin

1853.74 --> 1860.15
molten iron core okay its total

1857.61 --> 1860.1499999999999
horseshit

1864.05 --> 1867.18
[Music]

1885.83 --> 1893.4399999999998
yeah well I do I think it's total

1890.989 --> 1900.2
[ __ ]

1893.44 --> 1902.8690000000001
and by the way over the decades there

1900.2 --> 1904.3990000000001
are a lot of plenteous scientists

1902.869 --> 1907.9089999999999
although they're all censored now and

1904.399 --> 1913.9699999999998
everything that totally agree that it is

1907.909 --> 1918.8890000000001
total [ __ ] and politicized beyond

1913.97 --> 1922.69
recognition basically it's become a scam

1918.889 --> 1922.6899999999998
of literal global proportions

1937.89 --> 1946.3400000000001
look if the environment is changing and

1941.48 --> 1949.67
there is damage that we want to prevent

1946.34 --> 1954.3899999999999
then let's do something about it and

1949.67 --> 1957.78
actually help out what we want helped

1954.39 --> 1961.0400000000002
out gave them back what they're losing

1957.78 --> 1964.17
as much as possible and we can do that

1961.04 --> 1966.21
we have the capacity we have the

1964.17 --> 1973.6100000000001
industrial capability we have the

1966.21 --> 1973.6100000000001
knowledge of nature to do it in this age

1975.35 --> 1985.4099999999999
so let's build some artificial coral

1978.0 --> 1991.47
reefs let's let's build artificial ice

1985.41 --> 1997.1000000000001
platforms krill refuges or polar bear

1991.47 --> 1997.1000000000001
whale living territory you know

2009.77 --> 2012.8799999999999
[Music]

2020.63 --> 2031.99
[ __ ] we do that's total horse manure

2028.58 --> 2035.9289999999999
we do have the ability to imitate nature

2031.99 --> 2044.33
and we're doing it on a pretty epic

2035.929 --> 2049.27
scale we're reverse engineering the

2044.33 --> 2052.129
mechanics of animals insects plants

2049.27 --> 2054.2599999999998
biochemistry all these things we have so

2052.129 --> 2058.5099999999998
many capabilities these days don't

2054.26 --> 2058.51
underestimate what is actually possible

2072.03 --> 2084.82
dick he had jtt gaming I'm so excited

2078.399 --> 2087.419
about your black hole picture it I think

2084.82 --> 2087.4190000000003
they could have done better

2140.3 --> 2142.96
No

2144.049 --> 2155.339
now Juan Carlos stop the [ __ ] in

2150.71 --> 2157.14
fighting behavior please and if

2155.339 --> 2161.66
somebody's actually hiding a comment I

2157.14 --> 2161.66
can see it okay I can see that happening

2162.589 --> 2170.27
besides it's all being registered right

2166.92 --> 2170.27
there live anyway

2185.19 --> 2187.2200000000003
ah

2193.39 --> 2202.2799999999997
no bilgey in their model black holes are

2200.0 --> 2208.88
an up lower pressure system it has to do

2202.28 --> 2210.4100000000003
with the gravity so they suggest it's

2208.88 --> 2213.07
actually going to be a higher pressure

2210.41 --> 2215.47
system because of the increasing

2213.07 --> 2220.4500000000003
exponentially decreasing amount of

2215.47 --> 2224.0299999999997
gravity so node around a black hole

2220.45 --> 2227.0499999999997
there's not going to be a vacuum or very

2224.03 --> 2227.05
unlikely to be

2235.45 --> 2240.43
but yeah it's all science fiction

2237.28 --> 2243.13
anyways and I don't believe in black

2240.43 --> 2246.8089999999997
holes it's ridiculous it's a fascinating

2243.13 --> 2246.809
science fiction concept

2247.05 --> 2251.989
[Music]

2259.09 --> 2262.53
[Music]

2270.17 --> 2273.17
mmm

2275.07 --> 2279.48
that's funny peanuts Clark in my

2277.43 --> 2284.45
conceptualization of what light is a

2279.48 --> 2284.45
light year would be instant

2290.46 --> 2293.03
he

2296.36 --> 2301.88
doesn't really matter how much you will

2300.11 --> 2304.58
size it up some way it's always going to

2301.88 --> 2308.11
be instant because I think that light

2304.58 --> 2308.11
travels instantly

2315.4 --> 2321.11
or well you know what if I'd have to

2318.74 --> 2324.1299999999997
like speculate about it it might not

2321.11 --> 2327.67
literally travel instantly it may

2324.13 --> 2327.67
somehow be

2331.8 --> 2339.63
when it gets fragmented like refracted

2335.16 --> 2342.6
with prism effects then maybe it would

2339.63 --> 2345.27
slow look I don't even know if the

2342.6 --> 2349.37
concept of slowing down and increasing

2345.27 --> 2352.5
speed if that is even really there

2349.37 --> 2357.0
concerning light or if it's just the

2352.5 --> 2358.74
frequency of it because I think that

2357.0 --> 2361.26
they kind of mix it in like the

2358.74 --> 2364.77
frequency and thus the speed of the

2361.26 --> 2369.6600000000003
particle somehow speed of the light but

2364.77 --> 2371.7599999999998
I don't think that's really connected so

2369.66 --> 2374.3399999999997
yeah light as far as I'm concerned can

2371.76 --> 2378.78
just travel instantaneously doesn't

2374.34 --> 2381.96
really have a speed and I'd like to

2378.78 --> 2384.9900000000002
contest yeah

2381.96 --> 2388.11
suppose it proves that claim that it

2384.99 --> 2391.29
does and I will take a very close look

2388.11 --> 2396.6
at what they are very likely to have

2391.29 --> 2398.72
been deducing and how because I think

2396.6 --> 2402.0
it's probably deduction based and not

2398.72 --> 2408.98
not quite so literally measured like a

2402.0 --> 2408.98
literal delay I doubt it

2418.76 --> 2426.8590000000004
right I know Elijah takes a year at the

2422.21 --> 2429.619
light speed but that's a theoretical a

2426.859 --> 2436.27
fictional concept like has that ever

2429.619 --> 2440.359
been confirmed that light can actually

2436.27 --> 2449.33
take that amount of time to arrive

2440.359 --> 2452.74
somewhere you know what I mean I think

2449.33 --> 2459.19
it's just a science fiction conceptual

2452.74 --> 2459.1899999999996
approach it's just a concept

2465.25 --> 2470.01
Oh God Jason

2481.35 --> 2484.61
are you talking about

2489.76 --> 2497.2900000000004
hmm wait Han colors or do you mean my

2494.53 --> 2501.3100000000004
comment section not the live chat

2497.29 --> 2506.65
because that could be I've to fight off

2501.31 --> 2511.27
the trolls I think I said it to approval

2506.65 --> 2515.07
only because it was just getting in

2511.27 --> 2518.23
tenable just these trolls wouldn't

2515.07 --> 2520.3
simultaneously make like ten comments in

2518.23 --> 2527.92
the span of five minutes that kind of

2520.3 --> 2534.34
[ __ ] so I'm not hundred percent sure

2527.92 --> 2538.859
though but I can see you in this chat so

2534.34 --> 2538.859
I I don't know what you're talking about

2550.59 --> 2560.63
well soccer count if you can provide the

2555.45 --> 2565.0499999999997
proof that light has an actual speed and

2560.63 --> 2569.79
not based on some micro miniature type

2565.05 --> 2574.1600000000003
of deduction of some micro deviation but

2569.79 --> 2576.84
an actual yeah real confirmable timespan

2574.16 --> 2580.23
you can confirm that it has a specific

2576.84 --> 2582.75
speed or yeah find some confirmation of

2580.23 --> 2586.56
that an experiment that very tangibly

2582.75 --> 2589.59
proves that then I'll review it I'll

2586.56 --> 2591.89
look into that but you got to provide it

2589.59 --> 2591.8900000000003
first

2602.66 --> 2608.3399999999997
now Daniel field Daniel is definitely

2605.7 --> 2614.7799999999997
not Simon Dan Daniel is a lot freaking

2608.34 --> 2614.78
smarter than Simon then trust me I know

2636.92 --> 2645.2000000000003
yeah well just a saying it and we know

2642.26 --> 2650.78
this if we have it that's very nice

2645.2 --> 2652.99
well actually find it and give me the

2650.78 --> 2652.9900000000002
link

2659.49 --> 2665.54
and that's not true flatlander I wasn't

2661.619 --> 2665.54
eating yesterday the entire hangout

2665.87 --> 2669.13
[Music]

2679.93 --> 2687.79
really Tesla's Apple and how did you do

2682.63 --> 2690.34
that how did you measure the speed of

2687.79 --> 2693.09
light at electronics College now you

2690.34 --> 2693.09
make me curious

2701.16 --> 2710.0989999999997
Oh or our Reno Co wobbly wombly so

2707.67 --> 2713.579
you're not gonna send me a link because

2710.099 --> 2715.44
I disagree with you is that because you

2713.579 --> 2721.38
don't have any evidence and you just

2715.44 --> 2722.94
thread herring me or you know it's not

2721.38 --> 2726.119
gonna be good enough and I'm gonna look

2722.94 --> 2728.329
right through it yeah which one are you

2726.119 --> 2728.329
gonna pick

2738.47 --> 2741.47
yeah

2741.86 --> 2749.6400000000003
no sucker count I doubt it I

2746.37 --> 2752.1
I eat all organic so I'm never gonna be

2749.64 --> 2756.5099999999998
as big as Riley and besides he is much

2752.1 --> 2759.18
taller and he has the build for that I

2756.51 --> 2762.51
will never have that I just become

2759.18 --> 2765.72
extremely more hyperactive or more

2762.51 --> 2768.09
muscly instead I I'm never gonna go fat

2765.72 --> 2773.4599999999996
unless I stop eating healthy and I think

2768.09 --> 2776.34
that Riley is not the most healthy eater

2773.46 --> 2782.58
I don't think he's an all-organic guy at

2776.34 --> 2786.3
all and yeah if I would start to eat

2782.58 --> 2790.35
like non-organic pies or pastries

2786.3 --> 2792.4500000000003
constantly whatever I would become

2790.35 --> 2798.5699999999997
pretty bloated as well obey not

2792.45 --> 2800.91
something not like Riley though not

2798.57 --> 2807.5
saying that he is literally bloated he's

2800.91 --> 2807.5
look right he's a pretty big guy and I

2807.68 --> 2814.49
wouldn't call him obese or anything it's

2810.57 --> 2814.4900000000002
just just little chubby

2824.21 --> 2828.41
what Burt Reynolds

2830.339 --> 2833.18
the really

2837.49 --> 2843.04
right Steve well no doubt I don't know

2840.369 --> 2848.29
how I will transform physically if I

2843.04 --> 2850.569
ever get to a a real aging transition

2848.29 --> 2853.24
stage which I hope will take a long time

2850.569 --> 2857.23
and I don't know maybe I will become

2853.24 --> 2859.54
slightly saggy or bloaty I don't know or

2857.23 --> 2867.22
I might really turn into a skeleton and

2859.54 --> 2869.079
become really skinny I don't know it's

2867.22 --> 2876.1299999999997
hard to tell at this point I don't think

2869.079 --> 2877.96
I don't think so look I almost 40 and I

2876.13 --> 2884.369
don't even have any freaking gray hairs

2877.96 --> 2890.829
okay seriously right take a good look

2884.369 --> 2893.38
yeah this may be slightly receded but no

2890.829 --> 2897.01
gray hairs and yeah I knew a dude or I

2893.38 --> 2901.809
still know I'm kind of next roommate who

2897.01 --> 2904.2400000000002
was what is it like seven eight years

2901.809 --> 2909.059
younger and he had gray hairs all over

2904.24 --> 2909.0589999999997
him so

2916.239 --> 2928.099
yeah I'm good for now I think that if I

2925.729 --> 2930.4399999999996
will get some gray hairs or something

2928.099 --> 2932.96
it'll probably be in like ten years or

2930.44 --> 2935.96
something it might start up like

2932.96 --> 2941.559
noticeably cuz I do sometimes get a gray

2935.96 --> 2944.779
hair but it's I'd know very rarely and

2941.559 --> 2948.5190000000002
they don't persist that's the weirdest

2944.779 --> 2948.519
part about it they don't persist

2951.369 --> 2955.9300000000003
all right you we'll see about that

2957.999 --> 2967.3089999999997
that's right peanuts Clark I do have

2960.739 --> 2976.009
good genes when it comes to aging when

2967.309 --> 2977.7490000000003
it comes to creativity but I'm also kind

2976.009 --> 2981.95
of a character because of it but yeah

2977.749 --> 2984.529
that that always happens like just like

2981.95 --> 2989.749
my ex-girlfriend I was amazing

2984.529 --> 2993.529
but yeah a character you have to really

2989.749 --> 2995.5389999999998
know how to deal with that although she

2993.529 --> 2997.16
has she could have like if you really

2995.539 --> 3000.6600000000003
wanted to get close that is because she

2997.16 --> 3000.66
could really handle herself well

3001.52 --> 3004.559
[Music]

3009.61 --> 3013.4100000000003
not good to hear truth there's truth

3020.04 --> 3022.07
ah

3022.57 --> 3026.4300000000003
cool Juan Carlos

3040.58 --> 3049.85
hello space is fake yeah peach sorry not

3047.39 --> 3053.17
peachy I see you in chat oh but hello

3049.85 --> 3056.21
now was it

3053.17 --> 3058.19
jazz Jes akanda earlier asked if he

3056.21 --> 3062.45
could come on the panel and don't really

3058.19 --> 3068.93
feel like it but in retrospect I did

3062.45 --> 3072.98
hear back and despite I find just on the

3068.93 --> 3076.37
kind of really annoying but I kind of do

3072.98 --> 3078.77
our more an apology I think I think I

3076.37 --> 3081.41
should I don't know I feel it so I'm

3078.77 --> 3085.04
just gonna do it and say that yeah last

3081.41 --> 3091.49
time I was really hard to just call him

3085.04 --> 3096.73
a perpetual drunk but yeah because I

3091.49 --> 3099.5299999999997
don't know maybe really is like that but

3096.73 --> 3101.54
look that's just still very annoying to

3099.53 --> 3103.88
deal with and I'm definitely not gonna

3101.54 --> 3108.62
introduce him to my family if you know

3103.88 --> 3111.1600000000003
what I mean so sorry if I was mean to

3108.62 --> 3116.17
you but yeah you are

3111.16 --> 3116.17
yeah you're just on the left all that

3117.49 --> 3126.16
that don't make you very sociably

3121.97 --> 3126.16
Pleasant let's just say it like that

3134.78 --> 3142.2200000000003
all right does it kinda weird

3139.76 --> 3150.1090000000004
maybe you're just used to people telling

3142.22 --> 3152.5989999999997
you that you know maybe sounds even I

3150.109 --> 3155.84
don't I don't even mean it in a mean way

3152.599 --> 3157.7200000000003
but maybe you are just that weirdo and

3155.84 --> 3160.88
you're not drunk it should just

3157.72 --> 3164.23
accidentally sound like that and you do

3160.88 --> 3167.03
have a lot of these vague moments and

3164.23 --> 3169.849
confusions that just make it look

3167.03 --> 3171.92
exactly like if you were drunk that's

3169.849 --> 3174.71
the problem it really looks like you're

3171.92 --> 3177.59
drunk so I don't know if that is

3174.71 --> 3181.13
something that's just naturally with you

3177.59 --> 3184.19
yeah I'm kind of sorry for you but it is

3181.13 --> 3187.6400000000003
really annoying though so but you

3184.19 --> 3191.9
probably know that if you're like this

3187.64 --> 3194.75
constantly now just a counter I'm not

3191.9 --> 3198.67
