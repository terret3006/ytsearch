109.759 --> 115.84
still plenty of haze and trails

113.36 --> 120.2
that i've seen but yeah

115.84 --> 120.2

all right

139.52 --> 143.59900000000002
so yeah i had a really interesting

141.84 --> 144.56
conversation

143.599 --> 146.48
with

144.56 --> 148.959
mitchell from australia

146.48 --> 152.16
sleeping warrior chat about

148.959 --> 152.16
gas and mass

154.8 --> 157.84
white doesn't have any

158.16 --> 160.319
just

160.48 --> 165.51899999999998
tony seems to have

162.56 --> 167.76
some issue letting go

165.519 --> 170.76
he still wants to describe mass anyway

167.76 --> 170.76
but

171.12 --> 176.08
just not weight but it has mass so yeah

174.48 --> 179.04
but it's interesting those kind of

176.08 --> 181.04000000000002
mistakes very typical tony i'd say

179.04 --> 182.79999999999998
are interesting

181.04 --> 185.84
it's a group a good opportunity to

182.8 --> 185.84
explain why

196.4 --> 199.4
oh

203.92 --> 206.23899999999998
okay

208.879 --> 214.319
i guess brian wants to do a hangout

211.2 --> 214.319
somewhere later on

220.08 --> 224.87900000000002
and yeah yeah today's show is not going

222.48 --> 228.07999999999998

224.879 --> 228.07999999999998
it's not going to be about you

234.4 --> 240.799
so yeah who knows we might be doing a

237.92 --> 242.319
a show probably recorded

240.799 --> 244.959
about that later that would be

242.319 --> 244.95899999999997
interesting

246.0 --> 251.04
no ball busters yesterday by the way i

248.08 --> 251.04000000000002
thought there was gonna be

252.159 --> 255.319
it wasn't

258.56 --> 262.88
i did catch dell's

261.84 --> 264.4
show

262.88 --> 266.56
was fun

264.4 --> 269.59999999999997
to sit through that

266.56 --> 272.16
martin luther with flattery night

269.6 --> 274.8
messi as always he had some just dude

272.16 --> 274.8
that guy's

277.04 --> 282.639
he did sometimes like like to just throw

279.919 --> 284.24
trash at the screen thanks for that

282.639 --> 286.16
martin

284.24 --> 288.32
but other than that it was actually

286.16 --> 289.36
really interesting

288.32 --> 293.919
showing

289.36 --> 293.91900000000004
parts of him on his convention

294.16 --> 300.56
and it's good to hear like his condensed

298.16 --> 302.24
ideas of what have been has been

300.56 --> 303.919
happening in the past and with the mud

302.24 --> 304.96000000000004
flood and

303.919 --> 307.52
like he's

304.96 --> 310.32
he's gotten some his hands on some

307.52 --> 312.4
really interesting maps that i've never

310.32 --> 314.15999999999997
seen before

312.4 --> 317.59999999999997
of like

314.16 --> 318.72
old europe and america

317.6 --> 321.52000000000004
and like

318.72 --> 324.47900000000004
the there's like other lakes and

321.52 --> 326.32
places in africa and in america it's

324.479 --> 328.08
like different

326.32 --> 331.84
but with cities and everything it's

328.08 --> 331.84
fascinating i wonder what that is

332.32 --> 338.919
i don't know if that's a real map for

334.72 --> 338.91900000000004
sure but it seemed to be

344.96 --> 348.32
well returned to normal

349.68 --> 353.84000000000003
clutch

351.199 --> 353.84000000000003
good servant

355.28 --> 359.52
g

356.639 --> 361.84000000000003
g micronee

359.52 --> 366.44
hello welcome

361.84 --> 366.44
shout out from brazil interesting

366.8 --> 372.24
yeah return to normal leaf rest the head

368.8 --> 372.24
alone if you know what's good for you

373.44 --> 376.8
uh

374.639 --> 378.96000000000004
i've already addressed

376.8 --> 382.479
what he did yesterday is no need to

378.96 --> 385.039
start going after him trust me you will

382.479 --> 385.039
be sorry

391.199 --> 397.91900000000004
i know rasta had don't worry return to

393.68 --> 397.919
normal is very tacky sometimes so

403.6 --> 406.639
all right

405.12 --> 408.4
yeah

406.639 --> 412.24
yeah by the way the challenge still

408.4 --> 414.4
stands you were slandering yesterday

412.24 --> 416.96000000000004
it would be good if you'd actually put

414.4 --> 418.56
some proof

416.96 --> 419.84
with that mouth

418.56 --> 422.4
make a case

419.84 --> 424.88
because it's really annoying when you

422.4 --> 424.88
do that

425.68 --> 429.84000000000003
it's literally just poisoning the well

428.0 --> 430.96
at times right and hey yeah yeah you

429.84 --> 434.63899999999995
have called

430.96 --> 438.63899999999995
out certain people way way back

434.639 --> 440.56
and then it was relevant

438.639 --> 442.8
it was interesting

440.56 --> 442.8
but

443.28 --> 449.039
yeah there's something like

446.24 --> 451.599
overall value to what people do and they

449.039 --> 453.84
make their mistakes

451.599 --> 455.199
and you can't always

453.84 --> 456.79999999999995
like

455.199 --> 458.72
lay down

456.8 --> 462.96000000000004
bad intent

458.72 --> 465.84000000000003
at people's misfortune it's choices

462.96 --> 468.15999999999997
right so if you actually want to

465.84 --> 471.19899999999996
insinuate that you gotta back it with

468.16 --> 475.72
some serious evidence otherwise it is

471.199 --> 475.72
just poisoning the well you see

478.96 --> 483.52
so i'm calling you out on that rasta i

481.44 --> 486.96
really am and that's fine it doesn't

483.52 --> 486.96
really change anything else but

490.16 --> 495.44
oh his own donator says they were being

492.639 --> 497.199
ripped off yeah yeah

495.44 --> 499.36
oh

497.199 --> 501.199
like i've never had that before nobody

499.36 --> 503.91900000000004
ever sent me money and then started

501.199 --> 505.599
trolling other chats complaining about

503.919 --> 507.35999999999996
how i'm a grifter

505.599 --> 509.52
and that i've taken their money but

507.36 --> 512.159
won't do as they say

509.52 --> 515.4399999999999
like that never happens out here

512.159 --> 515.4399999999999
in social media land

516.64 --> 521.8389999999999
some people make videos are these his

518.959 --> 521.8389999999999
own people are they

523.519 --> 528.88
i mean i have plenty of people that have

525.6 --> 528.88
made videos about me

529.92 --> 535.1999999999999
they have been in my chat i have had

531.839 --> 537.7600000000001
conversations with some of them

535.2 --> 540.6400000000001
does that make them my own people that

537.76 --> 542.88
have made these videos about me

540.64 --> 545.68
right even people

542.88 --> 550.399
have made those types of videos about me

545.68 --> 550.399
that have later apologized for them

551.36 --> 555.6
and i can still

553.2 --> 558.9200000000001
talk with them now to a certain level

555.6 --> 558.9200000000001
right so

563.519 --> 567.839
he took money on problems now he was

565.6 --> 569.12
gonna build barteria

567.839 --> 571.6800000000001
and he has

569.12 --> 573.76
it's j it was never gonna be a giant

571.68 --> 576.92
festival ground though

573.76 --> 576.92
you see

580.8 --> 585.5999999999999
it's their problem no you are making it

582.88 --> 585.6
your problem

586.0 --> 591.64
you're the one bringing that up

588.24 --> 591.64
and for what

622.41 --> 626.7199999999999
[Music]

624.0 --> 628.959
yeah about that patreon case you know he

626.72 --> 630.399
actually won that right

628.959 --> 632.8
he won that

630.399 --> 635.839
in the court of law

632.8 --> 640.079
you do realize that right

635.839 --> 640.0790000000001
so you got anything else rasta

640.8 --> 644.8
whatever not making it up

644.839 --> 649.44
sure but you're holding on to that

647.44 --> 651.519
context aren't you

649.44 --> 654.0790000000001
that's what you're doing you're holding

651.519 --> 655.76
on to that angle of approach aren't you

654.079 --> 660.4399999999999
rasta hat

655.76 --> 660.4399999999999
getting back to old habits are we

666.74 --> 669.83
[Music]

670.399 --> 675.2
yeah well rasta had so did i yeah

673.36 --> 677.12
remember when was it two years ago with

675.2 --> 679.6800000000001
my air filter broke

677.12 --> 682.079
i wanted to get money for a new one i

679.68 --> 683.12
got half of it then i couldn't get it

682.079 --> 684.959
together

683.12 --> 687.519
and then i got into money trouble and i

684.959 --> 689.8389999999999
spent it on just my

687.519 --> 691.04
food and such right

689.839 --> 694.24
so

691.04 --> 695.519
am i a liar too now why are you here i'm

694.24 --> 698.24
a liar

695.519 --> 699.839
rasta i'm a liar by that angle of

698.24 --> 703.44
approach what are you doing here why are

699.839 --> 705.2790000000001
you friends with me i mean i lied

703.44 --> 708.32
i said i was gonna use the money for

705.279 --> 711.04
something and then i changed my mind

708.32 --> 715.0400000000001
i did apologize for it

711.04 --> 715.04
so did owen benjamin

715.12 --> 719.9590000000001
yeah why are you here rasta

737.279 --> 742.24
you're being a gamma right now

740.639 --> 744.8
i think that's blatantly apparent to

742.24 --> 746.72
everybody i apologize yeah yeah so did

744.8 --> 748.7199999999999
he

746.72 --> 750.9590000000001
so did he

748.72 --> 750.9590000000001
yeah

751.44 --> 754.0790000000001
he did

752.56 --> 757.1999999999999
several occasions

754.079 --> 760.56
explain like [ __ ] like this is

757.2 --> 762.8000000000001
like beyond my control i don't like he

760.56 --> 764.3199999999999
tried something completely new he's

762.8 --> 767.3599999999999
never done before

764.32 --> 770.1600000000001
and he ran into all kinds of issues

767.36 --> 773.839
including people like literally trying

770.16 --> 773.8389999999999
to burrow in like some tick

775.12 --> 780.079
that we're just waiting to sue him right

777.6 --> 782.0
people looking for an excuse to try to

780.079 --> 783.5999999999999
get to him to break him down that was

782.0 --> 785.44
happening a lot

783.6 --> 787.6
yeah

785.44 --> 789.6
so yeah then it didn't really work out

787.6 --> 791.9200000000001
as he thought

789.6 --> 794.9590000000001
and then he had to correct it and to say

791.92 --> 796.399
like yeah okay i'm sorry anybody sent me

794.959 --> 797.68
money

796.399 --> 799.04
but yeah

797.68 --> 801.5999999999999
it's

799.04 --> 804.0
i can't fulfill those promises you can't

801.6 --> 807.36
just come hobbling in like a festival

804.0 --> 810.24
ground because you donated some

807.36 --> 812.0790000000001
i'm sorry that's how it works

810.24 --> 816.32
so

812.079 --> 816.3199999999999
okay okay okay right

821.04 --> 826.16
right so to then start hammering on but

823.76 --> 827.36
all these people

826.16 --> 829.6
oh

827.36 --> 831.6
they feel cheated

829.6 --> 833.76
and now they're literally just going

831.6 --> 837.279
after him attacking attacking attacking

833.76 --> 839.279
right did they really want bertaria

837.279 --> 841.4399999999999
did they really did they get the spirit

839.279 --> 843.76
of bertaria

841.44 --> 846.32
or did they just want to find an

843.76 --> 846.3199999999999
entrance

846.399 --> 851.519
and like lay a claim to a ground where

849.44 --> 855.2790000000001
they can make demands like their little

851.519 --> 855.279
kingdoms or something right

855.36 --> 864.48
once we stay a little realistic here

859.6 --> 864.48
he got rich are you serious dude

865.279 --> 868.399
he's not rich

868.8 --> 875.3599999999999
he spent it all

870.88 --> 875.36
on the land on materials

877.6 --> 881.9200000000001
like there he's made a documentary about

880.0 --> 883.76
it laying it out pretty much i haven't

881.92 --> 885.04
actually seen it i've seen snippets of

883.76 --> 887.36
it

885.04 --> 888.399
he specifically made it

887.36 --> 889.36
to

888.399 --> 891.76
show

889.36 --> 894.88
what was happening

891.76 --> 897.04
he is the only winner

894.88 --> 900.0
oh

897.04 --> 901.8389999999999
yeah gamma alert indeed are you just

900.0 --> 904.16
jealous

901.839 --> 906.1600000000001
because it actually worked

904.16 --> 909.04
and he's still doing what he does and he

906.16 --> 911.279
has a whole bunch of people now there

909.04 --> 913.8389999999999
that are building what he envisioned and

911.279 --> 916.32
what other people's envisioned too

913.839 --> 919.2790000000001
and forming a community that is actually

916.32 --> 920.8000000000001
really high-end skilled

919.279 --> 924.24
and smart

920.8 --> 926.88
and self-educating and to homeschooling

924.24 --> 929.279
making their own food it's successful

926.88 --> 930.24
the project is succeeding are you just

929.279 --> 933.04
jealous

930.24 --> 934.48
because i'm a little jealous i am

933.04 --> 937.5999999999999
right i'm

934.48 --> 939.44
still here in this and i i'm i'm

937.6 --> 941.6800000000001
building my own

939.44 --> 945.36
thing

941.68 --> 945.3599999999999
but i yeah i'm not building a

945.44 --> 949.759
i'm not currently engaging in making

947.36 --> 951.36
babies if you know what i mean

949.759 --> 953.279
i don't have a garden

951.36 --> 955.839
so i am a little jealous too but i'm

953.279 --> 958.24
just not letting that get to me

955.839 --> 958.24
you see

959.36 --> 962.72
because i don't want to be

960.959 --> 964.16
an envious [ __ ]

962.72 --> 966.9590000000001
because that's what you become when you

964.16 --> 966.959
give into that

967.04 --> 969.8389999999999
i'm sorry

983.04 --> 986.16
yeah yeah yeah sure

987.12 --> 990.399
keep holding on rasta

994.72 --> 1000.32
keep focusing on that on that victim

997.04 --> 1000.3199999999999
approach it's brilliant

1005.6 --> 1008.399
very productive

1009.36 --> 1012.36
ugh

1054.88 --> 1060.0
rasta you know if it was anybody but you

1058.64 --> 1062.5590000000002
what you're doing in chat right now i

1060.0 --> 1066.28
would have banned you already

1062.559 --> 1066.28
get a grip on yourself

1070.559 --> 1074.96
yeah return to normal just

1073.44 --> 1079.64
stop doing that

1074.96 --> 1079.64
okay this is not dimitri or something

1097.2 --> 1099.28
ah

1098.0 --> 1103.32
all right

1099.28 --> 1103.32
i'm just gonna move on now

1111.679 --> 1115.44
right

1113.679 --> 1118.72
you you don't understand the word

1115.44 --> 1118.72
grifter peter christian

1119.919 --> 1123.44
well grifter is like a

1122.16 --> 1125.44
complex

1123.44 --> 1126.799
modern

1125.44 --> 1130.0
thing

1126.799 --> 1131.84
it's a bit like a scam artist

1130.0 --> 1134.64
actor

1131.84 --> 1137.4399999999998
that's just trying to extract money

1134.64 --> 1139.44
from groups like build them up

1137.44 --> 1141.3600000000001
start a scam or a pyramid scam or

1139.44 --> 1144.0800000000002
something and then just extract money

1141.36 --> 1146.08
and get and get out

1144.08 --> 1148.96
and then just pretend nothing ever

1146.08 --> 1150.32
happened avoid lawsuits migrate whatever

1148.96 --> 1152.16
and then do it over again that's the

1150.32 --> 1154.32
typical grifter

1152.16 --> 1156.96
this is a big claim to lay right and

1154.32 --> 1157.76
there are grifters out there we've met

1156.96 --> 1160.4
some

1157.76 --> 1160.4
on the scene

1161.679 --> 1166.3200000000002
and even those that are kind of easy to

1164.559 --> 1168.0
say and point at like oh yeah that's a

1166.32 --> 1170.3999999999999
grifter like that's

1168.0 --> 1174.16
it's a pretty far-fetched claim

1170.4 --> 1177.44
to make because a grifter is like

1174.16 --> 1179.8400000000001
a sociopath that can't get out that can

1177.44 --> 1181.76
never get out of that

1179.84 --> 1183.1999999999998
that's a real grifter

1181.76 --> 1185.76
and that's

1183.2 --> 1188.64
not an easy place to

1185.76 --> 1191.039
to find yourself at like so

1188.64 --> 1194.3200000000002
some people might have like

1191.039 --> 1197.84
grifter-ish traits but a true

1194.32 --> 1201.12
grifter is just that's kind of rare

1197.84 --> 1201.12
on average thank god

1202.4 --> 1205.48
all right

1212.0 --> 1216.48
your outer hair return to normal what

1213.679 --> 1216.48
are you talking about

1218.48 --> 1224.64
being unfair no no no ra dude rasta hat

1221.84 --> 1226.72
and me and go whack back like

1224.64 --> 1229.679
what is it now four years or something

1226.72 --> 1232.08
right you just came here like half a

1229.679 --> 1235.8400000000001
year ago

1232.08 --> 1235.84
so you need to take it easy a bit

1247.6 --> 1252.8799999999999
you didn't bring those topics up yeah

1249.679 --> 1255.3600000000001
yeah one troll popped up and said

1252.88 --> 1257.0390000000002
if it was is a grifter and then you

1255.36 --> 1259.6789999999999
spent

1257.039 --> 1261.44
like 20 sentences after that in 10

1259.679 --> 1263.8400000000001
minutes

1261.44 --> 1266.24
trying to double down on that and then

1263.84 --> 1270.08
bring owen benjamin in there too yeah so

1266.24 --> 1270.08
you did that don't you freaking

1270.4 --> 1275.3600000000001
snivel your way out of what you did

1272.4 --> 1278.0
rasta don't you [ __ ] lay that blame

1275.36 --> 1280.1589999999999
down to somebody else's feet of some

1278.0 --> 1281.039
sock account that popped up and said

1280.159 --> 1282.48
that

1281.039 --> 1284.799
that was you

1282.48 --> 1287.799
that was you looking for an excuse to do

1284.799 --> 1287.799
that

1293.6 --> 1298.08
not today oh yeah sure

1301.679 --> 1306.3200000000002
yeah return to normal started that yeah

1303.679 --> 1310.0800000000002
you could have just ignored it

1306.32 --> 1310.08
i told him to take it easy

1310.559 --> 1312.96
you know

1315.28 --> 1320.48
got pulled in today

1317.2 --> 1320.48
all right fine

1321.28 --> 1327.12
but yeah you're still not here from a

1323.6 --> 1327.12
neutral vantage point though

1329.36 --> 1333.6
like you might feel like oh it's just a

1331.44 --> 1336.48
fresh new day i can start from scratch

1333.6 --> 1339.48
but yeah yesterday still happen

1336.48 --> 1339.48
so

1347.919 --> 1351.1200000000001
hey one for a unit

1352.64 --> 1357.96
ace two roy never heard of that

1394.72 --> 1396.96
hmm

1397.36 --> 1402.1999999999998
uh yeah sorry getting distracted by

1399.2 --> 1402.2
skype

1405.52 --> 1409.12
you get a fresh start with me all the

1407.36 --> 1411.6
time yeah but that's in private

1409.12 --> 1414.1589999999999
conversations rasa

1411.6 --> 1415.52
i have a show to run

1414.159 --> 1418.64
it's public

1415.52 --> 1422.559
i have a responsibility here

1418.64 --> 1422.5590000000002
and when somebody goes over the edge

1423.919 --> 1427.6000000000001
and kind of like ruins the show

1428.72 --> 1433.3600000000001
that doesn't just go away

1432.08 --> 1436.24
all right

1433.36 --> 1436.24
set things right

1440.0 --> 1445.679
i mean if you've said something like

1442.08 --> 1447.6
that in private yeah fine you know

1445.679 --> 1451.279
need to get off some steam or whatever

1447.6 --> 1453.84
that's fine but you made a claim

1451.279 --> 1456.159
about people that i actually respect and

1453.84 --> 1457.84
a lot of other people do too

1456.159 --> 1461.96
and

1457.84 --> 1461.9599999999998
that doesn't just go away

1478.71 --> 1481.91
[Music]

1488.559 --> 1492.6399999999999
all right yeah one for the unit that's

1490.24 --> 1495.799
right i've seen that

1492.64 --> 1495.7990000000002
the grifters

1510.96 --> 1514.96
yeah

1512.96 --> 1517.44
yeah it's not the first time right and

1514.96 --> 1519.52
in previous times

1517.44 --> 1522.88
i was a lot more pissed off because of

1519.52 --> 1522.8799999999999
it that's right it happens

1526.96 --> 1530.159
doesn't change anything

1534.72 --> 1539.84
if anything it adds to it because if

1537.12 --> 1542.4799999999998
it's a reoccurring issue

1539.84 --> 1546.0
that means that ignoring it won't make

1542.48 --> 1546.0
it go away you see

1551.6 --> 1557.3999999999999
because it comes back

1553.36 --> 1557.3999999999999
if it's not addressed properly

1560.32 --> 1564.08
uh

1562.0 --> 1567.279
what's going on here

1564.08 --> 1570.799
right oh yeah yeah good servant that

1567.279 --> 1573.279
yesterday's stream was great it's privy

1570.799 --> 1576.32
to be in the chat the entire time dude

1573.279 --> 1577.6
you should do longer streams man

1576.32 --> 1579.9189999999999
but

1577.6 --> 1582.3999999999999
probably

1579.919 --> 1584.64
you're doing as long as you can

1582.4 --> 1586.3200000000002
but it's like there's some real heavy

1584.64 --> 1587.8400000000001
energy

1586.32 --> 1592.52
i like it

1587.84 --> 1592.52
you get a lot of people in your chat

1605.12 --> 1610.1999999999998
yeah one hour

1606.64 --> 1610.2
it's pretty decent

1612.4 --> 1616.88
i guess it's maybe even better like that

1614.4 --> 1618.88
because at the end when you are left

1616.88 --> 1623.48
craving for more

1618.88 --> 1623.48
that almost makes even a better show

1633.76 --> 1636.76
so

1656.24 --> 1659.76
right so by the way the title of the

1658.32 --> 1662.399
show

1659.76 --> 1664.8799999999999
is very appropriate

1662.399 --> 1670.32
to a whole bunch of things

1664.88 --> 1670.3200000000002
i originally extracted it by

1670.64 --> 1676.0
condensing

1673.52 --> 1678.24
the argument concerning

1676.0 --> 1680.24
mass

1678.24 --> 1682.3990000000001
it basically was derived from that

1680.24 --> 1684.159
directly with my conversation

1682.399 --> 1685.84
mitchell from australia and sleeping

1684.159 --> 1688.0
warrior

1685.84 --> 1690.9599999999998
like don't attack the convention like

1688.0 --> 1693.279
don't attack mass

1690.96 --> 1695.679
it is a convention

1693.279 --> 1697.039
because it's still kind of handy right

1695.679 --> 1700.48
to attack

1697.039 --> 1703.52
something that is kind of like in use

1700.48 --> 1706.24
is effectively counterproductive to the

1703.52 --> 1708.24
learning processes people confronting

1706.24 --> 1710.08
with it right

1708.24 --> 1714.3990000000001
it's better that you just lay out

1710.08 --> 1714.399
perfectly like why to avoid it

1715.76 --> 1719.76
why to avoid it in certain types of

1717.52 --> 1721.52
arguments like okay like mass yeah that

1719.76 --> 1722.8799999999999
works out when you're gonna weigh things

1721.52 --> 1725.2
and all that

1722.88 --> 1727.679
and yeah sure it might apply some

1725.2 --> 1729.8400000000001
newtonian gravity

1727.679 --> 1731.039
effectively but it's not really relevant

1729.84 --> 1733.36
it isn't

1731.039 --> 1736.32
because it is about weighing things and

1733.36 --> 1738.6399999999999
like how much do they weigh right

1736.32 --> 1742.72
and that it uses mass and then you can

1738.64 --> 1745.679
calculate and predict things with mass

1742.72 --> 1748.159
and that's all just fine but

1745.679 --> 1751.6000000000001
that doesn't mean that mass is a real

1748.159 --> 1754.24
thing like density is like matter all

1751.6 --> 1756.7199999999998
matter has density always

1754.24 --> 1758.48
it's universal it is

1756.72 --> 1760.799
physical reality

1758.48 --> 1763.279
the mass is a derived concept it's a

1760.799 --> 1764.72
convention that's used

1763.279 --> 1768.08
to

1764.72 --> 1768.08
calculate weight

1770.0 --> 1775.52
right so don't attack oh don't use mass

1772.559 --> 1777.44
don't use mass but if somebody uses mass

1775.52 --> 1779.279
incorrectly in a statement yeah then

1777.44 --> 1781.52
point that out

1779.279 --> 1783.6
don't say don't don't say the word mass

1781.52 --> 1785.84
mass is evil

1783.6 --> 1785.84
right

1788.08 --> 1792.32
and even with gravity

1790.159 --> 1795.1200000000001
it's like yeah when somebody just

1792.32 --> 1797.4399999999998
mentions gravity in their calculation

1795.12 --> 1800.399
it's not really relevant if they're not

1797.44 --> 1801.919
trying to prove a ball earth you see

1800.399 --> 1804.32
it's just like no i'm just calculating

1801.919 --> 1805.279
on gravity eating mass unless this is

1804.32 --> 1807.36
the number

1805.279 --> 1811.039
that's all just fine because that's what

1807.36 --> 1812.399
it was meant for it was like a tool

1811.039 --> 1814.08
gravity

1812.399 --> 1818.4799999999998
the mechanical wrap was a tool to

1814.08 --> 1818.48
calculate to assist calculations

1819.36 --> 1826.0
in weight and all that right that's what

1822.0 --> 1827.679
it was really useful for why destroy

1826.0 --> 1829.76
all of it

1827.679 --> 1831.76
just because it's a convention

1829.76 --> 1833.52
you see

1831.76 --> 1836.24
so

1833.52 --> 1838.399
don't attack the convention just

1836.24 --> 1840.159
understand what it is and avoid

1838.399 --> 1841.84
misapplication

1840.159 --> 1843.8400000000001
and everything will be all right because

1841.84 --> 1846.24
then

1843.84 --> 1848.559
when misapplication is avoided it's not

1846.24 --> 1850.88
a problem anymore right it's only a

1848.559 --> 1854.0
problem when it's misapplied

1850.88 --> 1856.159
that is when the problem arises

1854.0 --> 1858.159
don't attack the convention it's just

1856.159 --> 1859.1200000000001
information it's just a way of doing

1858.159 --> 1860.159
things

1859.12 --> 1864.039
just don't

1860.159 --> 1864.0390000000002
apply it incorrectly

1866.32 --> 1871.6789999999999
right because if you do that

1868.72 --> 1876.76
there will be no obstacles

1871.679 --> 1876.76
in ascension when approaching it

1878.24 --> 1883.84
nobody can object to just being

1880.559 --> 1885.84
clarified about what something is

1883.84 --> 1888.6399999999999
well when you're being alerted to

1885.84 --> 1891.1999999999998
something like this is bad

1888.64 --> 1893.3600000000001
it doesn't do that it doesn't assist you

1891.2 --> 1895.919
in actually understanding it

1893.36 --> 1897.12
it actually dissuades you it inserts an

1895.919 --> 1899.76
emotion

1897.12 --> 1900.9599999999998
kind of tends to do that

1899.76 --> 1902.559
fear

1900.96 --> 1905.039
or

1902.559 --> 1907.9189999999999
annoyance

1905.039 --> 1910.24
to not deal with it well not dealing

1907.919 --> 1912.48
with it also means that you're not gonna

1910.24 --> 1914.799
understand it better

1912.48 --> 1917.519
so just try to understand it and then

1914.799 --> 1920.08
avoid misusing it

1917.519 --> 1924.32
that's that's the best wisest course of

1920.08 --> 1926.32
action on how to deal with conventions

1924.32 --> 1928.6789999999999
and of course we are going to

1926.32 --> 1931.039
continually keep facing the

1928.679 --> 1933.2
misapplications of conventions all the

1931.039 --> 1936.399
time when we deal with anti-flat

1933.2 --> 1939.8400000000001
earthers and ignorant ballers

1936.399 --> 1942.4799999999998
we just haven't caught on yet newbies

1939.84 --> 1946.08
that will always happen

1942.48 --> 1948.159
we know that we have recorded that to no

1946.08 --> 1950.32
end how they just keep recycling the

1948.159 --> 1952.0
same mistakes over and over again on

1950.32 --> 1953.12
purpose

1952.0 --> 1955.6
so they

1953.12 --> 1958.2399999999998
purposefully

1955.6 --> 1961.1999999999998
misunderstand

1958.24 --> 1963.919
and apply fallaciously

1961.2 --> 1967.279
their conventions

1963.919 --> 1970.159
because their misapplication is part

1967.279 --> 1974.279
of their machination structure to

1970.159 --> 1974.279
reinforce the global belief

1980.72 --> 1986.64
but just because they do that

1983.919 --> 1988.7990000000002
doesn't mean that we should attack those

1986.64 --> 1992.24
conventions because they

1988.799 --> 1993.9189999999999
conveniently abuse them all the time

1992.24 --> 1996.3990000000001
right they take that information and

1993.919 --> 1999.44
they twist it and they use it

1996.399 --> 2001.1999999999998
to annoy us and to confuse us

1999.44 --> 2005.039
doesn't mean you should attack the

2001.2 --> 2007.279
weapon that sounds familiar

2005.039 --> 2010.48
weapons don't kill people people kill

2007.279 --> 2012.88
people right don't attack

2010.48 --> 2015.2
self-defense laws guns

2012.88 --> 2017.3600000000001
it's the people that do it well the same

2015.2 --> 2018.799
counts for information don't attack the

2017.36 --> 2021.519
information

2018.799 --> 2022.96
just make sure that people don't misuse

2021.519 --> 2026.559
it

2022.96 --> 2027.519
it's universal it's universal this

2026.559 --> 2029.9189999999999
title

2027.519 --> 2033.84
the show is universal and applies to

2029.919 --> 2033.8400000000001
many many things

2034.88 --> 2038.0
and it is an important

2037.12 --> 2041.279
key

2038.0 --> 2045.159
to maintaining freedom also it is an

2041.279 --> 2045.159
important key to freedom

2067.119 --> 2070.639
all right i made a joke i'm gonna read

2069.44 --> 2074.52
it out

2070.639 --> 2074.52
i can find it back

2077.679 --> 2080.2400000000002
where was it

2084.879 --> 2087.1189999999997
right

2087.2 --> 2090.399
this is a word joke

2090.8 --> 2096.5600000000004
you'll figure it out right so

2092.879 --> 2098.24
we need a mass for gas because gas has

2096.56 --> 2100.839
no mass

2098.24 --> 2103.359
and is causing a lot of grief for some

2100.839 --> 2105.839
people a mass

2103.359 --> 2108.0
for gas would give them an opportunity

2105.839 --> 2112.52
to lay down

2108.0 --> 2112.52
or lay that anguish to rest

2121.2 --> 2123.4399999999996
maybe

2122.24 --> 2125.7599999999998
yeah

2123.44 --> 2125.76
yeah

2125.839 --> 2129.24
you get it

2147.359 --> 2151.5989999999997
let me repeat

2149.92 --> 2154.48
we need

2151.599 --> 2156.839
a mass for gas because gas has no mass

2154.48 --> 2160.0
and is causing a lot of grief for some

2156.839 --> 2164.48
people a mass for gas would give them an

2160.0 --> 2164.48
opportunity to lay that anguish to rest

2169.839 --> 2174.0789999999997
it's a bit of a mind twister i like it

2174.48 --> 2177.2
i like it when two

2176.079 --> 2181.04
separate

2177.2 --> 2182.3199999999997
applications of a single word can

2181.04 --> 2186.079
like

2182.32 --> 2188.96
both work in bizarre ways and

2186.079 --> 2188.96
it's almost like a

2190.24 --> 2193.52
a binary

2192.32 --> 2196.56
matrix

2193.52 --> 2196.56
of application

2197.2 --> 2198.72
of

2198.0 --> 2201.52
like

2198.72 --> 2204.24
any ordering of the two

2201.52 --> 2208.16
meanings of mass

2204.24 --> 2208.16
no nobody's getting it okay

2208.64 --> 2211.96
all right

2217.31 --> 2221.83
[Music]

2226.32 --> 2229.44
yeah that's right control of the mind

2228.0 --> 2232.48
gaining wisdom

2229.44 --> 2235.119
and if you don't control your own mind

2232.48 --> 2238.64
then somebody else will

2235.119 --> 2241.359
and that's how government came to be

2238.64 --> 2243.04
government only exists because there are

2241.359 --> 2245.5989999999997
a bunch of people out there a whole

2243.04 --> 2245.599
bunch of them

2245.68 --> 2249.2799999999997
that want to be governed

2249.44 --> 2252.8
and

2250.88 --> 2255.119
it wouldn't be fair to take that away

2252.8 --> 2259.28
from them

2255.119 --> 2259.28
but their choices do have consequences

2267.28 --> 2273.6400000000003
yeah good servant thanks for ruining it

2270.0 --> 2273.64
you ruined it

2289.119 --> 2291.28
oh that's

2290.32 --> 2293.6800000000003
yeah

2291.28 --> 2295.92
bry thank you that's actually even a

2293.68 --> 2299.839
better one

2295.92 --> 2299.839
for some people no for the masses

2301.599 --> 2309.079
i love that

2304.24 --> 2309.0789999999997
just made the matrix a three-way

2321.119 --> 2325.839
that's brilliant so we need a mass for

2323.599 --> 2328.8
gas because gas has no mass and it is

2325.839 --> 2331.04
causing a lot of great with the masses

2328.8 --> 2333.44
yeah

2331.04 --> 2333.44
thank you

2333.599 --> 2336.92
that's good

2346.4 --> 2349.4
um

2355.52 --> 2360.92
i'll post it

2356.88 --> 2360.92
so you just read it

2405.2 --> 2411.4399999999996
newton was born on xmas what are you

2408.88 --> 2413.839
talking about dominoid what

2411.44 --> 2413.839
this is

2418.64 --> 2424.44
oh oh look we got a baller in chat oh

2426.0 --> 2432.079
of course gas has mass how do you think

2429.359 --> 2433.68
sailing ships work

2432.079 --> 2436.48
uh

2433.68 --> 2436.48
air pressure

2436.839 --> 2442.96
differential yeah

2439.92 --> 2444.64
it's like one part of the air is

2442.96 --> 2446.88
more dense

2444.64 --> 2448.7999999999997
than another so it's gonna move towards

2446.88 --> 2450.4
that and anything that is there

2448.8 --> 2453.2000000000003
obstructing it

2450.4 --> 2454.88
is gonna get pushed against

2453.2 --> 2457.359
and that push

2454.88 --> 2461.92
is effectively a force from the

2457.359 --> 2464.0
air pressure differential which gas has

2461.92 --> 2465.04
certain circumstances usually due to

2464.0 --> 2468.079
heat

2465.04 --> 2470.64
and cold differentials

2468.079 --> 2472.88
and then yeah that pushes

2470.64 --> 2475.359
the sail and the sail pushes the boat

2472.88 --> 2475.359
forward

2475.839 --> 2480.24
dense is more mass no that's a

2478.0 --> 2481.44
reification it's not mass is a

2480.24 --> 2484.0
convention

2481.44 --> 2486.2400000000002
density is real

2484.0 --> 2488.48
is physical

2486.24 --> 2491.2
is absolute every

2488.48 --> 2494.2
all matter has density all of it in all

2491.2 --> 2494.2
circumstances

2496.0 --> 2502.16
yeah but you see mass per unit volume

2499.68 --> 2504.16
is a concept

2502.16 --> 2506.839
you're literally taking something that

2504.16 --> 2509.839
is real density and then

2506.839 --> 2513.04
mathematically making it into a spectrum

2509.839 --> 2515.92
dividing the one part

2513.04 --> 2517.839
with the other the volume with

2515.92 --> 2520.56
well

2517.839 --> 2524.16
that other thing which is classified as

2520.56 --> 2527.599
mass it doesn't actually consist

2524.16 --> 2530.0789999999997
i'm sorry it doesn't actually exist

2527.599 --> 2532.6400000000003
in the physical world though it's a

2530.079 --> 2536.7200000000003
extrapolation

2532.64 --> 2539.68
and its utilization is a convention it's

2536.72 --> 2541.359
not physical you understand it's not

2539.68 --> 2544.24
real

2541.359 --> 2546.72
it's a derived concept yeah i know oh

2544.24 --> 2549.52
look up look it up oh

2546.72 --> 2552.3999999999996
so dense no it's not it's all bunch of

2549.52 --> 2552.4
math garbage

2558.4 --> 2561.6800000000003
mass

2559.599 --> 2564.7200000000003
is a convention

2561.68 --> 2567.68
it's derived from density

2564.72 --> 2570.8799999999997
conventions are not physical

2567.68 --> 2574.1189999999997
literal real things

2570.88 --> 2574.119
they're extrapolations

2583.04 --> 2587.44
yeah you want ruse you know why that is

2585.44 --> 2590.8
you know why an empty

2587.44 --> 2590.8
gas spraying bottle

2590.88 --> 2595.92
that has less weight

2592.8 --> 2598.0
because when it's in there

2595.92 --> 2600.56
it's not gas

2598.0 --> 2603.04
you never even thought about that

2600.56 --> 2605.52
are you that short-sighted you didn't

2603.04 --> 2608.96
even realize that when it's in there

2605.52 --> 2612.319
it's not gas it's compressed until it's

2608.96 --> 2614.64
liquid and when it's liquid it does have

2612.319 --> 2614.64
mass

2615.119 --> 2618.839
you get it

2616.88 --> 2622.2400000000002
it does have it it has the

2618.839 --> 2624.16
susceptibility to momentum it has the

2622.24 --> 2626.8799999999997
the other word that it freaking keeps

2624.16 --> 2628.0789999999997
inertia it has inertia liquids have

2626.88 --> 2630.88
inertia

2628.079 --> 2633.599
it becomes effectively weighing

2630.88 --> 2636.56
something because it's compressed

2633.599 --> 2638.0
to the level that it liquefies and as a

2636.56 --> 2641.599
liquid

2638.0 --> 2644.0
it does effectively has those abilities

2641.599 --> 2647.3590000000004
and it does become weight

2644.0 --> 2648.96
but in a gaseous state right an empty

2647.359 --> 2653.04
can

2648.96 --> 2656.2400000000002
is not actually an empty can

2653.04 --> 2659.04
you see there's still gas in there

2656.24 --> 2661.2
it just doesn't weigh anything

2659.04 --> 2664.079
because the pressure on the inside of

2661.2 --> 2665.839
the can is become equal to the pressure

2664.079 --> 2668.4
outside of the can

2665.839 --> 2669.68
and so there is no more relative density

2668.4 --> 2672.1600000000003
offset

2669.68 --> 2675.52
right so an empty can

2672.16 --> 2677.2799999999997
is not a vacuum can

2675.52 --> 2679.2
there's still gas in there it just

2677.28 --> 2682.48
doesn't weigh anything because gas

2679.2 --> 2685.1189999999997
doesn't have mass you see

2682.48 --> 2685.119
you get it

2689.76 --> 2693.8390000000004
oxygen tank is not liquid

2696.56 --> 2700.4
i don't know where you're getting that

2702.56 --> 2705.839
pretty sure it is

2707.119 --> 2711.839
it's not a regular gaseous state anyway

2709.68 --> 2711.839
like

2712.4 --> 2717.28
if it would never liquefy under extreme

2715.44 --> 2719.04
pressure that would be extremely

2717.28 --> 2721.44
dangerous because that means that the

2719.04 --> 2723.44
effective pressure

2721.44 --> 2726.079
will like

2723.44 --> 2729.599
just compound and compound

2726.079 --> 2729.599
i don't know where you're getting that

2730.24 --> 2735.5989999999997
i mean i have seen liquid oxygen you can

2733.119 --> 2737.2000000000003
see it it has steam and [ __ ]

2735.599 --> 2739.3590000000004
you know in those stupid videos where

2737.2 --> 2742.8799999999997
they throw it on some fire and [ __ ]

2739.359 --> 2747.319
that's liquid that's not invisible right

2742.88 --> 2747.319
which is what gas is it's invisible

2756.079 --> 2761.04
dude i don't know about your oxygen tank

2758.72 --> 2763.5989999999997
but

2761.04 --> 2766.319
this is quite absurd to me maybe it is

2763.599 --> 2766.319
an exception

2771.28 --> 2776.079
maybe it doesn't become liquid i don't

2772.88 --> 2777.359
know i'm not sure i've never actually

2776.079 --> 2779.599
seen

2777.359 --> 2781.68
oxygen being compressed oxygen

2779.599 --> 2783.44
specifically in a

2781.68 --> 2786.3999999999996
transparent tank

2783.44 --> 2786.4
i've never seen that

2787.599 --> 2791.52
so i don't know

2789.359 --> 2795.7999999999997
i don't know if you've ever seen that or

2791.52 --> 2795.8
just heard about it

2817.76 --> 2820.8
specific mess

2824.24 --> 2828.0789999999997
yeah thanks for that thursday beetroot

2827.2 --> 2830.3999999999996
yeah

2828.079 --> 2832.8
so effectively it is an extracted

2830.4 --> 2833.839
concept i hope that's clear to you at

2832.8 --> 2836.079
least

2833.839 --> 2839.119
density is the real thing it's what all

2836.079 --> 2841.3590000000004
matter has in all circumstances mass is

2839.119 --> 2844.079
an extracted convention that require

2841.359 --> 2847.2
very specific traits

2844.079 --> 2847.2000000000003
for that to apply

2848.16 --> 2853.04
and gases don't have that trait so they

2851.119 --> 2856.2400000000002
don't have a mass

2853.04 --> 2857.119
it's not mass it's not what mass is used

2856.24 --> 2859.839
for

2857.119 --> 2863.04
in the convention it doesn't have that

2859.839 --> 2866.5589999999997
now it's still the the substance

2863.04 --> 2869.839
might have a universal atomic mass

2866.559 --> 2874.88
but that's not the same

2869.839 --> 2874.88
as an effective mass in calculations

2875.28 --> 2878.6400000000003
because it doesn't always apply

2879.68 --> 2883.9199999999996
mass

2880.96 --> 2887.44
atomic mass is the presumed

2883.92 --> 2889.28
well density

2887.44 --> 2892.4
of a singular

2889.28 --> 2894.1600000000003
molecule or atom

2892.4 --> 2895.359
but it's basically a theoretically

2894.16 --> 2897.52
extracted

2895.359 --> 2899.2799999999997
calculated thing also

2897.52 --> 2902.96
because can you really isolate a

2899.28 --> 2902.96
singular molecule or atom

2904.079 --> 2908.2400000000002
i mean it's probably claimed that they

2906.079 --> 2911.6800000000003
can with the

2908.24 --> 2912.8799999999997
the hydrogen collider and all that but

2911.68 --> 2915.839
yeah

2912.88 --> 2915.839
outside of that

2926.839 --> 2932.0789999999997
oh okay i could just get out if you're

2930.559 --> 2935.119
just gonna be like that

2932.079 --> 2939.28
yeah because gas has no mass mass is a

2935.119 --> 2939.28
convention and it doesn't apply to gases

2940.8 --> 2944.76
gas only have a density

2956.24 --> 2961.1189999999997
is it not mass if it weighs more on the

2958.72 --> 2962.9599999999996
scale

2961.119 --> 2963.92
well it could be a preponderance of

2962.96 --> 2965.599
weight

2963.92 --> 2967.44
sure but

2965.599 --> 2968.4
as i've said before

2967.44 --> 2971.28
it is

2968.4 --> 2972.64
not logical to assume that that

2971.28 --> 2975.6800000000003
weight

2972.64 --> 2980.0
extraction will be proportional

2975.68 --> 2980.0
to the atomic mass to its actual

2980.64 --> 2986.7999999999997
yeah molecular mass

2984.16 --> 2988.48
because it's it's weight is a derived

2986.8 --> 2990.96
concept

2988.48 --> 2992.64
from relative density this equilibrium

2990.96 --> 2995.28
so if the

2992.64 --> 2997.44
density differential between a gas

2995.28 --> 3000.559
contained

2997.44 --> 3001.359
the surrounding medium gas

3000.559 --> 3003.3590000000004
is

3001.359 --> 3006.72
barely going to be any different then

3003.359 --> 3008.96
it's just yeah it might be in there and

3006.72 --> 3010.9599999999996
the volume of it might actually supposed

3008.96 --> 3012.88
to be weighing something

3010.96 --> 3016.079
but it is gas your state is just not

3012.88 --> 3016.079
going to be proportional

3017.04 --> 3023.7599999999998
only way to really weigh gases is by not

3020.64 --> 3027.1189999999997
making them gases anymore

3023.76 --> 3031.559
and then you get a more reliable

3027.119 --> 3031.559
weight atomic mass ratio

3040.119 --> 3044.559
voice here i don't know who that is

3045.359 --> 3048.92
juan ruiz

3059.28 --> 3064.88
what happens to the weight is gone

3062.48 --> 3066.88
the convention doesn't function anymore

3064.88 --> 3068.48
that's what happens to the weight juan

3066.88 --> 3069.839
aru is

3068.48 --> 3073.68
is gone

3069.839 --> 3075.68
because it was a derived concept anyway

3073.68 --> 3077.359
just the the pressure differential

3075.68 --> 3079.839
caused by the relative density this

3077.359 --> 3083.839
equilibrium

3079.839 --> 3083.839
in a numerical setup

3095.44 --> 3098.64
the massive errors

3098.72 --> 3103.24
dude

3100.24 --> 3103.24
whatever

3125.92 --> 3131.52
i guess actually yeah but you're saying

3128.72 --> 3133.7599999999998
it dude george you are saying

3131.52 --> 3136.64
it is gas yeah

3133.76 --> 3136.6400000000003
i don't believe you

3136.72 --> 3141.04
i've never seen that before this is

3138.4 --> 3141.04
ridiculous

3141.68 --> 3146.0789999999997
like what proof do you have it is still

3144.24 --> 3148.7999999999997
in a gaseous state

3146.079 --> 3152.52
under all that pressure

3148.8 --> 3152.52
i don't believe you

3171.04 --> 3175.2
is helium lighter than air

3173.52 --> 3179.96
well that's a colloquial way of

3175.2 --> 3179.96
expressing it stone monkey 3d

3180.559 --> 3185.0400000000004
it's definitely less dense than air

3192.72 --> 3195.68
okay so now we're all getting colloquial

3194.48 --> 3199.76
again oh

3195.68 --> 3200.7999999999997
drowning in the mass assumption

3199.76 --> 3203.3590000000004
huh

3200.8 --> 3204.96
isn't that great how you get taught how

3203.359 --> 3207.2799999999997
to utilize

3204.96 --> 3210.0
colloquial language how to describe

3207.28 --> 3212.3190000000004
things yeah yeah mass wait that's just

3210.0 --> 3213.119
great isn't it everything expressed in

3212.319 --> 3215.68
that

3213.119 --> 3218.48
when you just roughly tried to describe

3215.68 --> 3220.5589999999997
something yeah but it's incorrect though

3218.48 --> 3223.599
and it's there on purpose the [ __ ] with

3220.559 --> 3225.52
your mind and you let it

3223.599 --> 3228.0
you want to be [ __ ] with your mind

3225.52 --> 3229.839
don't you you want that

3228.0 --> 3231.68
because you keep on parroting the same

3229.839 --> 3234.0789999999997
[ __ ] over and over again instead of

3231.68 --> 3236.0
actually

3234.079 --> 3239.44
listening

3236.0 --> 3239.44
to what i'm saying about it

3239.599 --> 3244.0
you love that

3241.2 --> 3246.3999999999996
oh look oh some in some other expression

3244.0 --> 3248.16
there's gravity and mass and weight and

3246.4 --> 3250.48
oh this is how you express that with

3248.16 --> 3253.92
gravity mass and weight yeah we know

3250.48 --> 3256.0
we know it's everywhere everywhere

3253.92 --> 3259.2000000000003
it's the common tongue

3256.0 --> 3262.16
it's what everybody has become used to

3259.2 --> 3265.04
saying it like it's what they do

3262.16 --> 3266.7999999999997
and you'll love it don't you you love to

3265.04 --> 3269.04
just latch on

3266.8 --> 3271.6800000000003
but everybody says it like that yeah and

3269.04 --> 3271.68
it's wrong

3271.839 --> 3275.44
it's wrong

3273.2 --> 3277.04
everybody says it wrong because they

3275.44 --> 3278.2400000000002
don't get it

3277.04 --> 3279.599
they don't understand what they're

3278.24 --> 3282.3999999999996
actually talking about they're just

3279.599 --> 3285.839
trying to describe something

3282.4 --> 3288.2400000000002
on a kind of intuitive level

3285.839 --> 3290.319
it's not mechanical

3288.24 --> 3292.319
haven't actually thought about it and

3290.319 --> 3295.52
nobody's expecting everybody to

3292.319 --> 3298.24
constantly think mechanically like that

3295.52 --> 3300.559
that doesn't make it correct though

3298.24 --> 3303.839
right so when you're gonna use that as a

3300.559 --> 3306.88
defense why i'm supposedly wrong for

3303.839 --> 3309.52
claiming gas has no mass

3306.88 --> 3313.52
then yeah you're being

3309.52 --> 3313.52
kind of an idiot on purpose

3315.599 --> 3318.799
yeah that's right

3317.359 --> 3321.44
that's right

3318.799 --> 3324.48
you are wrong

3321.44 --> 3325.76
everybody that claims gas has mass is

3324.48 --> 3328.48
wrong

3325.76 --> 3331.44
they're technically incorrect they're

3328.48 --> 3332.88
reifying a convention into physical

3331.44 --> 3335.44
reality

3332.88 --> 3338.76
and they're doing it incorrectly

3335.44 --> 3338.76
that's right

3351.28 --> 3357.92
no no they can't bobby steals stop

3353.52 --> 3357.92
blabbering your propaganda [ __ ]

3360.799 --> 3364.88
why am i technically correct because i

3363.28 --> 3367.599
know what the [ __ ] i'm talking about

3364.88 --> 3370.2400000000002
here i know what mass is i know what

3367.599 --> 3372.559
density is i know how these things work

3370.24 --> 3376.0
how the conventions are constructed and

3372.559 --> 3377.3590000000004
utilized i've specialized in this for

3376.0 --> 3379.92
four years

3377.359 --> 3381.68
talking about it every freaking day for

3379.92 --> 3382.559
hours

3381.68 --> 3384.799
yeah

3382.559 --> 3386.48
i know what i'm talking about here

3384.799 --> 3389.04
you don't

3386.48 --> 3391.839
you're just going by what the masses say

3389.04 --> 3391.839
ironically

3392.72 --> 3397.4399999999996
just parroting the same [ __ ] over and

3394.88 --> 3397.44
over again

3398.799 --> 3404.4
you don't even know what science is

3402.24 --> 3407.68
you literally do not know

3404.4 --> 3412.1600000000003
you are a baltard thursday beetroot you

3407.68 --> 3414.16
are a ball [ __ ] a [ __ ]

3412.16 --> 3416.24
book brain

3414.16 --> 3419.839
that doesn't know a machination if it

3416.24 --> 3423.24
bit him in the ass that's what you are

3419.839 --> 3423.24
you get it

3425.05 --> 3428.1090000000004
[Music]

3432.37 --> 3436.27
[Music]

3440.0 --> 3443.92
nothing to do with ball oh yeah it does

3442.559 --> 3447.2000000000003
it does

3443.92 --> 3449.28
because gravity assumption is ingrained

3447.2 --> 3451.7599999999998
within that very trainer thinking it's

3449.28 --> 3453.2000000000003
part of the colloquialism it's part of

3451.76 --> 3454.88
it

3453.2 --> 3458.799
we know it is

3454.88 --> 3462.799
it's all one giant model

3458.799 --> 3464.0
the [ __ ] with your mind to mount mold it

3462.799 --> 3468.16
shape it

3464.0 --> 3470.96
to make the ball magicians be able to do

3468.16 --> 3473.2
their [ __ ] right on top of it and there

3470.96 --> 3476.079
won't be anything you can do about it

3473.2 --> 3477.52
because you believe the groundwork

3476.079 --> 3480.079
nonsense

3477.52 --> 3484.319
that they've deliberately programmed

3480.079 --> 3487.2000000000003
into you through schools school books

3484.319 --> 3491.04
a bunch of blabbering mouth scientists

3487.2 --> 3491.04
that don't do actual experiments

3497.68 --> 3501.7599999999998
yeah i know i know basic education yeah

3500.799 --> 3504.4
that's it

3501.76 --> 3506.88
it's education for the basic

3504.4 --> 3508.48
that's exactly what it is

3506.88 --> 3510.7200000000003
yeah

3508.48 --> 3513.2
think like this think like that this is

3510.72 --> 3515.5989999999997
how we say things this is how it is yeah

3513.2 --> 3519.2
that's called basic education because

3515.599 --> 3519.2000000000003
it's for basic people

3521.599 --> 3527.799
are you banned

3524.0 --> 3527.799
yeah you are bent

3542.96 --> 3547.359
well that's very cute george sanford

3544.96 --> 3550.16
that you know that for a fact

3547.359 --> 3555.64
but won't actually deliver evidence for

3550.16 --> 3555.64
it that's great thanks it's very helpful

3573.83 --> 3577.0989999999997
[Music]

3579.16 --> 3585.5389999999998
[Music]

3587.52 --> 3590.559
yeah

3588.4 --> 3592.88
great puppy stills yeah

3590.559 --> 3594.4
by gas by weight isn't that just lovely

3592.88 --> 3596.88
i told you

3594.4 --> 3599.92
it's in everything they put it in

3596.88 --> 3603.119
everything they just say gas you can't

3599.92 --> 3606.16
buy it in weight no you don't

3603.119 --> 3606.1600000000003
that's not gas

3606.319 --> 3610.4
that's gas compressed to liquid

3609.04 --> 3613.64
because that's the only way you can

3610.4 --> 3613.64
weigh it

3614.559 --> 3618.079
it's not going to be enough right you're

3616.72 --> 3618.9599999999996
not going to

3618.079 --> 3622.799
weigh

3618.96 --> 3625.2
a giant balloon with unpacked gas that

3622.799 --> 3627.359
is equal to the pressure outside

3625.2 --> 3629.839
right that's not how you buy gas you buy

3627.359 --> 3632.0
it compressed

3629.839 --> 3634.0789999999997
and compressed gas

3632.0 --> 3636.079
almost every occasion turns to liquid

3634.079 --> 3637.8390000000004
and sometimes it even turns to solid

3636.079 --> 3639.04
apparently it just turns to crystal for

3637.839 --> 3641.04
some reason

3639.04 --> 3642.96
but it definitely doesn't stay gas

3641.04 --> 3646.96
because gas in its natural

3642.96 --> 3646.96
state expands in all directions

3647.2 --> 3650.3999999999996
and

3648.319 --> 3652.5589999999997
you can't weigh it

3650.4 --> 3654.96
because it's only going to apply to

3652.559 --> 3657.76
relative density with the medium it is

3654.96 --> 3662.64
in which is very close to it because all

3657.76 --> 3662.6400000000003
gas kind of does that becomes very close

3663.359 --> 3668.0
in density

3664.799 --> 3670.16
to any gas surrounding it that's just

3668.0 --> 3674.079
if it's enclosed right if it's enclosed

3670.16 --> 3674.0789999999997
in a flexible container like a balloon

3682.96 --> 3689.52
where does he wake you where is he go

3686.0 --> 3689.52
it's gone it's gone

3689.839 --> 3692.64
that

3690.64 --> 3694.0
the convention is gone

3692.64 --> 3696.24
doesn't work anymore it's not gonna

3694.0 --> 3698.64
exert that pressure in a linear

3696.24 --> 3700.4799999999996
relationship to its atomic mass so it's

3698.64 --> 3701.68
gone yeah where does it weight go yeah

3700.48 --> 3704.319
it's gone

3701.68 --> 3707.44
the convention is no longer possible

3704.319 --> 3712.04
because it doesn't have inertia anymore

3707.44 --> 3712.04
it doesn't go down go boom boom anymore

3712.16 --> 3717.68
yeah in order to exert that linear

3714.88 --> 3719.839
pressure relation with its atomic mass

3717.68 --> 3721.839
doesn't do that anymore in gas you stay

3719.839 --> 3724.64
so yeah it's gone the weight it's just

3721.839 --> 3726.4
gone ah it's gone

3724.64 --> 3728.24
right you might still have some relative

3726.4 --> 3730.319
density offset

3728.24 --> 3732.319
one gas to another it's not going to be

3730.319 --> 3737.16
proportional though

3732.319 --> 3737.16
right because it's in its gaseous state

3742.559 --> 3745.559
uh

3765.039 --> 3768.96
how dumb can a person be

3767.76 --> 3771.6800000000003
very dumb

3768.96 --> 3773.28
unbelievably dumb

3771.68 --> 3775.52
stubborn

3773.28 --> 3777.6800000000003
well calculated knows all the

3775.52 --> 3779.52
machinations by heart but doesn't know

3777.68 --> 3782.48
their imagination

3779.52 --> 3785.68
and then clings to it like clinging to

3782.48 --> 3788.68
your own chains you pathetic sack of

3785.68 --> 3788.68
[ __ ]

3801.119 --> 3805.319
yeah clary you're very late

3830.599 --> 3837.6400000000003
non-liquid gas what

3834.079 --> 3837.6400000000003
what does that mean

3841.039 --> 3844.039
right

3854.64 --> 3860.799
interesting well look you know

3857.599 --> 3863.6800000000003
gas storage i haven't exactly

3860.799 --> 3866.64
done like an engineering study to that

3863.68 --> 3869.68
exactly every element of it who knows

3866.64 --> 3872.0
man i could imagine still that some

3869.68 --> 3874.48
gases no matter how much you compact

3872.0 --> 3876.72
them under pressure they just don't form

3874.48 --> 3879.039
a liquid for some mysterious reason that

3876.72 --> 3882.0789999999997
i don't know

3879.039 --> 3885.119
but instead they just become like super

3882.079 --> 3887.119
super super super super super compact

3885.119 --> 3888.4
gas

3887.119 --> 3890.4
well

3888.4 --> 3892.48
if it's going to be super compact gas

3890.4 --> 3894.4
then effectively the density which gas

3892.48 --> 3897.119
still does have

3894.4 --> 3899.28
will also compact right

3897.119 --> 3902.079
there's going to be more of it in the

3899.28 --> 3902.079
same volume

3902.319 --> 3908.96
and that means that it is going to then

3904.559 --> 3910.96
offset to regular pressure gas

3908.96 --> 3912.2400000000002
surrounding it

3910.96 --> 3915.2
right so there will be a relative

3912.24 --> 3918.5589999999997
density offset significantly so

3915.2 --> 3921.359
maybe if it is super compacted gas it

3918.559 --> 3924.6400000000003
would be considered that in that state

3921.359 --> 3926.96
it is just as effectively usable to

3924.64 --> 3928.0
calculate weight with it

3926.96 --> 3930.559
because the

3928.0 --> 3932.799
relative density offset is just

3930.559 --> 3934.559
significant enough

3932.799 --> 3936.72
for the weighing process for that

3934.559 --> 3938.6400000000003
convention to transpire

3936.72 --> 3941.0389999999998
and yield a pretty

3938.64 --> 3943.2
close to atomic weight

3941.039 --> 3945.8390000000004
result

3943.2 --> 3945.839
who knows

3947.599 --> 3951.839
but uncompacted gases

3951.92 --> 3956.079
i don't think so because

3953.599 --> 3959.599
the weighing things

3956.079 --> 3962.079
and the derived mass value

3959.599 --> 3964.1600000000003
comes from regular air weight which

3962.079 --> 3967.119
means you put something on a scale

3964.16 --> 3970.16
surrounded by a medium of air

3967.119 --> 3972.88
regular ground level air pressure right

3970.16 --> 3975.7599999999998
so if the thing you're weighing

3972.88 --> 3976.48
is very close in density

3975.76 --> 3979.119
to

3976.48 --> 3983.2
the medium

3979.119 --> 3987.359
it's not gonna weigh properly

3983.2 --> 3989.7599999999998
it's not gonna reflect the proper

3987.359 --> 3992.0789999999997
atomic weight ratio it's gonna maybe

3989.76 --> 3995.599
exert some pressure if the density of

3992.079 --> 3997.6800000000003
the gas contained is higher

3995.599 --> 3998.319
than the density of the air surrounding

3997.68 --> 4000.64
it

3998.319 --> 4003.119
but if it's lighter it's going to go up

4000.64 --> 4005.68
well where's your weighing

4003.119 --> 4009.76
there's no weight

4005.68 --> 4009.7599999999998
that convention no longer applies

4009.839 --> 4014.4
right

4011.119 --> 4016.799
weighing only works really

4014.4 --> 4018.319
gives a consistent

4016.799 --> 4022.4
ratio

4018.319 --> 4023.7599999999998
when the density of the object being

4022.4 --> 4027.599
weighed

4023.76 --> 4030.96
is much higher than the medium it is in

4027.599 --> 4035.48
that is the the condition for weight as

4030.96 --> 4035.48
a convention to become effective

4036.0 --> 4039.839
that is the case i'm making here

4040.64 --> 4046.0789999999997
right i'm taking mass as an absolute the

4044.079 --> 4048.2400000000002
convention as an absolute for

4046.079 --> 4049.8390000000004
calculation right because calculations

4048.24 --> 4051.359
have to be absolute

4049.839 --> 4053.7599999999998
well guess what

4051.359 --> 4056.5589999999997
when it's gas

4053.76 --> 4058.559
it's no longer an absolute relation

4056.559 --> 4060.799
because it becoming too close to the

4058.559 --> 4064.6400000000003
density of the medium

4060.799 --> 4067.119
so that convention doesn't apply to gas

4064.64 --> 4068.72
the ratio becomes off do you get it yet

4067.119 --> 4072.799
that's the case i'm making that's what

4068.72 --> 4075.68
i'm saying i know it's very difficult

4072.799 --> 4078.72
because it's just pretty subtle it's a

4075.68 --> 4080.3999999999996
subtle mistake to make

4078.72 --> 4083.0389999999998
and it is important for the

4080.4 --> 4085.119
understanding of what what weight

4083.039 --> 4087.119
and mass really are

4085.119 --> 4090.079
conventions

4087.119 --> 4092.0
based on pressure differentials due to

4090.079 --> 4095.119
relative density

4092.0 --> 4095.119
this equilibrium

4100.4 --> 4103.4
right

4116.96 --> 4122.88
right so i hope i have satisfactory

4120.08 --> 4124.08
satisfaction wise answered

4122.88 --> 4126.159000000001
your

4124.08 --> 4128.5599999999995
your claim there george sanford like

4126.159 --> 4131.12
okay if there is a gas that doesn't

4128.56 --> 4136.159000000001
liquefy under extreme high pressure then

4131.12 --> 4137.759
maybe it does become weighable again

4136.159 --> 4141.12
because the relative density

4137.759 --> 4143.12
differential between it

4141.12 --> 4144.64
and the medium things are being weighed

4143.12 --> 4147.12
in which is regular air pressure it

4144.64 --> 4150.4800000000005
becomes high enough okay are you

4147.12 --> 4151.3589999999995
satisfied now maybe gas can be weighed

4150.48 --> 4154.0
but

4151.359 --> 4155.359
regular unpressurized gas

4154.0 --> 4158.159
no

4155.359 --> 4158.159000000001
no it doesn't

4158.88 --> 4165.4400000000005
right and you we can definitely conclude

4161.679 --> 4168.4
that super high pressure stored gas

4165.44 --> 4169.678999999999
is not exactly a naturally occurring

4168.4 --> 4171.839
phenomenon

4169.679 --> 4173.04
right there might be some pressure build

4171.839 --> 4176.88
up sure

4173.04 --> 4178.239
in nature overall there is no super high

4176.88 --> 4180.2390000000005
pressure

4178.239 --> 4183.44
contained gas

4180.239 --> 4185.759
that's not a natural phenomenon

4183.44 --> 4190.879999999999
anyway

4185.759 --> 4190.88
what is the unit for density uh density

4194.4 --> 4197.679
the unit for density

4198.48 --> 4203.44
well density does have a numeric value i

4200.84 --> 4205.679
think i don't know what the unit for it

4203.44 --> 4209.04
is i you see i don't really spend a lot

4205.679 --> 4212.4
of time on calculating things and math

4209.04 --> 4215.199
and formulas and even the exactness

4212.4 --> 4219.04
right i don't need

4215.199 --> 4221.678999999999
like sick super detailed numerical

4219.04 --> 4222.88
perfection i'm not interested in that

4221.679 --> 4225.679
never been

4222.88 --> 4227.679
what i am interested in is

4225.679 --> 4230.64
exact function

4227.679 --> 4233.28
as to what is the process actually

4230.64 --> 4235.92
transpiring how does that work how do

4233.28 --> 4237.92
the relations between the elements work

4235.92 --> 4239.84
that's what i'm interested in not

4237.92 --> 4243.36
numbers

4239.84 --> 4246.32
and not like how do you designate

4243.36 --> 4248.4
a certain element within

4246.32 --> 4250.239
yeah the calculation process that's

4248.4 --> 4252.639999999999
never been my thing i've never been good

4250.239 --> 4255.36
at that never really cared

4252.64 --> 4258.400000000001
i just want to know how it works

4255.36 --> 4260.08
and i want to be able to describe it and

4258.4 --> 4262.08
the relations

4260.08 --> 4264.32
and then elaborate on it so you can

4262.08 --> 4267.12
truly understand and not get caught up

4264.32 --> 4269.12
on formulas on a piece of paper or on a

4267.12 --> 4272.76
screen

4269.12 --> 4272.76
that's what i do

4277.92 --> 4280.719
okay adam

4279.679 --> 4284.64
yeah i've been

4280.719 --> 4284.64
trying to address this for quite a while

4284.96 --> 4290.96
i've actually argued that if gas would

4287.76 --> 4293.280000000001
be extremely high pressured in a natural

4290.96 --> 4296.4800000000005
container

4293.28 --> 4299.12
and it doesn't turn to a liquid that the

4296.48 --> 4301.599999999999
overall density of it because of the

4299.12 --> 4303.04
unnatural levels of pressure

4301.6 --> 4304.88
might actually

4303.04 --> 4306.32
cause

4304.88 --> 4309.52
enough

4306.32 --> 4310.5599999999995
density versus the medium together to

4309.52 --> 4313.92
enable

4310.56 --> 4315.92
to register kind of a linear relation

4313.92 --> 4317.92
weight from it

4315.92 --> 4319.52
but that is like only a natural

4317.92 --> 4321.28
circumstance because gas doesn't

4319.52 --> 4323.679
normally pressurize like that never

4321.28 --> 4323.679
happens

4325.44 --> 4328.96
not like that

4326.88 --> 4331.12
right gas get does get pressured

4328.96 --> 4332.64
pressurized sometimes but never to those

4331.12 --> 4335.679
levels that you would be able to

4332.64 --> 4335.679
normally weigh it

4335.76 --> 4340.4800000000005
not to the level where the density

4338.159 --> 4343.28
versus the medium becomes

4340.48 --> 4345.759999999999
significant enough indifference to get a

4343.28 --> 4346.88
kind of a linear weight relationship

4345.76 --> 4349.360000000001
with it

4346.88 --> 4350.4800000000005
what do you think about that

4349.36 --> 4352.239
anyway

4350.48 --> 4355.4
i'll be back two minutes love to hear

4352.239 --> 4355.4

hmm

4477.12 --> 4481.36
oh wow

4478.239 --> 4483.36
adam that's fascinating that

4481.36 --> 4485.199
that totally backs what i just been

4483.36 --> 4488.639999999999
saying

4485.199 --> 4488.639999999999
i've never even thought about that

4490.159 --> 4493.159
fascinating

you all there

4638.88 --> 4643.4400000000005
and until yeah have a nice day

4641.76 --> 4645.679
enjoy the weather if you got some good

4643.44 --> 4647.44
weather out there don't forget

4645.679 --> 4650.159
don't just stick

4647.44 --> 4651.28
your face in your mobile constantly and

4650.159 --> 4654.48
ignore

4651.28 --> 4656.639999999999
nature while it's still beautiful

4654.48 --> 4658.718999999999
it's always kind of beautiful

4656.64 --> 4661.280000000001
but yeah don't forget to enjoy the

4658.719 --> 4664.719
simple things don't just stare in your

4661.28 --> 4666.5599999999995
stupid little mobile all day long

4664.719 --> 4668.0
right trolls are still going to do that

4666.56 --> 4670.080000000001
anyway

4668.0 --> 4673.04
because they they they're not getting

4670.08 --> 4674.96
afraid to look up because then they feel

4673.04 --> 4676.0
again who and what they really have

4674.96 --> 4679.84
become

4676.0 --> 4682.48
they don't want that so they just stick

4679.84 --> 4684.2390000000005
they become mobile faces forever

4682.48 --> 4687.44
and they do this this sort of [ __ ] to

4684.239 --> 4688.879999999999
fill up that all that time

4687.44 --> 4691.839999999999
right

4688.88 --> 4694.8
wouldn't want to be them anyway

4691.84 --> 4698.6
until the next video

4694.8 --> 4698.6
keep it flat

4699.39 --> 4712.93
