91.52 --> 96.32
wind

93.119 --> 97.52
out there and yeah if you know the

96.32 --> 99.439
clouds

97.52 --> 101.6
are kind of pretty and there's a bit of

99.439 --> 105.36
blue here and there

101.6 --> 109.439
it's really cold outside it's just cold

105.36 --> 109.439
because this constant gusts of wind

112.0 --> 117.84
so yeah it's kind of a stormy day

115.04 --> 120.71900000000001
not so much rain although a couple of

117.84 --> 120.71900000000001
drops here and there

121.439 --> 124.39899999999999
but yeah

126.64 --> 129.75900000000001
a lot of birds hanging up there in the

128.8 --> 133.04000000000002
storm as well

129.759 --> 143.67999999999998
it's weird it's all over the place

133.04 --> 146.07999999999998
they're all hanging up there

143.68 --> 146.08
all right

150.48 --> 156.39999999999998
so hello brand m

153.519 --> 157.04
yeah i picked up on that mute button of

156.4 --> 161.519
mine

157.04 --> 163.76
very quickly but thanks for reminding me

161.519 --> 163.76000000000002
uh

166.879 --> 171.84
green tea still very hot

175.12 --> 178.31900000000002
i don't know what kind of show it's

176.48 --> 181.84
gonna be today

178.319 --> 183.599
i'm just super restless today probably

181.84 --> 187.12
due to the wind mostly

183.599 --> 190.0
it's not helping anyway but

187.12 --> 192.8
we had a pretty crazy day yesterday

190.0 --> 192.8
overall as well

193.84 --> 200.159
in a sense just a lot of pressure piling

197.12 --> 200.159
up from all directions

203.76 --> 207.599
and i barely made notes goody

210.4 --> 213.84
right but anyway received the shocking

212.799 --> 217.20000000000002
news that

213.84 --> 220.48
well the new roommate that i thought was

217.2 --> 221.76
pretty cool apparently he got the corona

220.48 --> 224.48
vaccine

221.76 --> 227.28
just like that dropped that so yeah that

224.48 --> 231.04
was kind of blown away by that

227.28 --> 233.2
and repulsed

231.04 --> 235.04
but in not in a way that i could

233.2 --> 237.67999999999998
basically express to him

235.04 --> 239.67999999999998
because he obviously doesn't know what

237.68 --> 242.0
the hell he's doing

239.68 --> 242.87900000000002
there's no use trying to get through to

242.0 --> 245.28
him

242.879 --> 245.28
at all

247.2 --> 251.67999999999998
so yeah that makes me feel a little

250.72 --> 255.84
isolated

251.68 --> 255.84
not surprisingly

265.28 --> 269.55999999999995
right oh yeah i totally forgot to call

267.36 --> 272.56
the date it's 27 of march

269.56 --> 272.56
2021

273.68 --> 278.24
oh look a bit of sun coming through

275.6 --> 278.24
that's nice

280.639 --> 284.16
hello foul on buchanan

294.84 --> 301.11999999999995
right

296.96 --> 304.479
yeah i just got tension on me i

301.12 --> 308.08
all this [ __ ] is really bad i'm i'm

304.479 --> 311.44
very very disappointed

308.08 --> 314.479
in my roommate and

311.44 --> 316.479
i'm wondering like okay so are they all

314.479 --> 319.199
just going to get

316.479 --> 320.0
do this just because it was told and

319.199 --> 323.44
they were

320.0 --> 327.199
warned not to look too straight

323.44 --> 331.68
for the conspiracy theorists

327.199 --> 334.88
because the damages just

331.68 --> 334.88
cannot be overseen

335.52 --> 339.12
like the long-term [ __ ] you know leave

338.16 --> 341.44
alone the people

339.12 --> 342.32
that are just gonna drop dead just like

341.44 --> 346.639
that

342.32 --> 351.84
also for that hasn't happened just yet

346.639 --> 356.639
over here with anybody in my direct

351.84 --> 356.63899999999995
environment but

358.08 --> 360.8
like yeah

361.12 --> 367.84000000000003
what do you do with this

370.16 --> 377.6
how do you deal with basically a

374.479 --> 379.12
war situation that is happening when

377.6 --> 381.6
most people

379.12 --> 384.319
can't be made to realize that it's a war

381.6 --> 384.319
situation

385.28 --> 392.88
right they would rather die

389.759 --> 395.84000000000003
than wake up to that what do you do with

392.88 --> 395.84
that

398.319 --> 404.47900000000004
and it's really gnawing on me really

401.6 --> 409.84000000000003
really hard and i got i got shoulder

404.479 --> 409.84
issues again

410.319 --> 414.96000000000004
though i have cut down on the coffee and

412.24 --> 418.479
everything and doing pretty well

414.96 --> 421.84
diet wise sleep wise

418.479 --> 424.8
oh yeah another good thing i guess today

421.84 --> 424.79999999999995
got a new oven

425.36 --> 429.759
so that that should be nice might have

427.52 --> 437.84
some pizza later

429.759 --> 437.84000000000003
tonight who knows

446.72 --> 451.84000000000003
all right

455.68 --> 461.039
i mean is there anybody else out there

458.08 --> 462.71999999999997
that's experiencing this

461.039 --> 465.84
you're getting a whole bunch of [ __ ]

462.72 --> 465.84000000000003
piled on you

465.919 --> 470.31899999999996
and what stresses you out you can't even

469.039 --> 472.71999999999997
communicate

470.319 --> 474.56
because nobody's listening or the ones

472.72 --> 477.59900000000005
that you know

474.56 --> 478.0
hear it can understand it as soon as you

477.599 --> 480.96
approach

478.0 --> 482.16
them what happens is they actually pile

480.96 --> 485.19899999999996
all their [ __ ]

482.16 --> 489.84000000000003
on top of you too and it's like

485.199 --> 489.84000000000003
it's overkill everything out there is

490.84 --> 493.84
overkill

495.44 --> 502.639
it's like being stuck in a siege

498.56 --> 502.639
that most people can't even see

503.039 --> 510.24
because it really feels like that

506.96 --> 510.23999999999995
hey hello adam meekin

510.639 --> 518.8

558.56 --> 563.8389999999999
be right last week was a premiere

569.279 --> 577.8389999999999

723.44 --> 727.44
yeah look guys you want me to talk about

726.8 --> 729.92
anything

727.44 --> 730.9590000000001
because right now other than anything

729.92 --> 733.36
you're gonna hand me

730.959 --> 744.7199999999999
to me i'm pretty much filled with

733.36 --> 748.0790000000001
[ __ ] doom right now

744.72 --> 748.72
i'm just seeing things unfold and it's

748.079 --> 751.68
like

748.72 --> 753.76
they don't even realize it it's gonna

751.68 --> 755.12
take a whole lot of time and i'm already

753.76 --> 758.16
waiting

755.12 --> 760.9590000000001
like being around my 50s i guess

758.16 --> 761.76
and then hearing the statistics bureau

760.959 --> 766.959
like

761.76 --> 772.3199999999999
oh yeah fertility of everybody below 40

766.959 --> 776.0
has dropped dramatically to like

772.32 --> 778.5600000000001
98 sterile

776.0 --> 781.279
that i'm really like that sort of shit's

778.56 --> 781.279
gonna roll out

784.32 --> 790.72
and yeah i'm saying it here

787.68 --> 793.8389999999999
ten years before that roughly i think

790.72 --> 798.1600000000001
this is roughly

793.839 --> 800.48
and yeah who's gonna who's stopping it

798.16 --> 801.92
nobody's stopping it it's just happening

800.48 --> 802.72
all these gimps out there all these

801.92 --> 805.5999999999999
idiots are

802.72 --> 805.6
just doing it

807.36 --> 812.9590000000001
like in a giant cult they're all

810.48 --> 813.6
sacrificing a pardon themselves and they

812.959 --> 816.8
don't

813.6 --> 818.88
even realize it because they have been

816.8 --> 822.16
conditioned to believe that it's

818.88 --> 825.8389999999999
normal to do that normal

822.16 --> 829.8389999999999
for everybody to do whatever the [ __ ]

825.839 --> 829.839
the overlord is saying

847.92 --> 857.8389999999999
right kind of like this

851.199 --> 857.8389999999999
link here in chat

875.279 --> 885.8389999999999
blew away jim

903.92 --> 910.959
worry about it worry about god's plan

907.6 --> 913.12
well what about what about

910.959 --> 914.959
in the future when this shit's gonna

913.12 --> 918.0
roll out

914.959 --> 920.4799999999999
and we say yeah we knew that

918.0 --> 921.199
and then we're gonna get the blame for

920.48 --> 927.839
it

921.199 --> 927.8389999999999
huh how about that [ __ ] happening

939.519 --> 945.12
oh god's plan yeah well god's plan is to

942.24 --> 948.8
literally just wipe it all out i think

945.12 --> 953.199
at this point the machine's there

948.8 --> 957.7589999999999
it's been built it's not of god

953.199 --> 960.959
it's running and yeah it's

957.759 --> 963.519
just churning up

960.959 --> 965.1199999999999
these generations just churning it up

963.519 --> 969.839
into

965.12 --> 969.839
garbage meatloaf

976.48 --> 982.639
yeah you know just to understand

980.32 --> 985.1990000000001
spiritual things and oversight i'm

982.639 --> 988.24
getting kind of sick of just saying

985.199 --> 988.88
trust plan i'm getting sick of this

988.24 --> 991.92
concept

988.88 --> 995.199
trust plan [ __ ]

991.92 --> 997.92
plan the [ __ ] has got to end

995.199 --> 1000.4799999999999
it has to freaking end i don't care

997.92 --> 1003.279
whose [ __ ] plan it is

1000.48 --> 1003.279
has to stop

1004.24 --> 1009.519
no more plans [ __ ] the plans whatever

1007.199 --> 1025.839
they are whoever's handing it out

1009.519 --> 1025.839
this garbage has got to stop

1036.839 --> 1039.839
so

1078.84 --> 1081.84
so

1101.919 --> 1108.3200000000002
all right yeah and clutch bear look

1105.76 --> 1110.16
it's all really cool you know trusting

1108.32 --> 1113.12
god's plan and oh it's all been

1110.16 --> 1116.48
accounted for in the long run whatever

1113.12 --> 1116.8799999999999
yeah at the same time i'm just somebody

1116.48 --> 1119.2
that

1116.88 --> 1120.7990000000002
has kind of like chronic isolation

1119.2 --> 1122.799
issues

1120.799 --> 1124.48
seeing the world literally commit

1122.799 --> 1127.9189999999999
suicide around me

1124.48 --> 1132.96
without even knowing it yeah

1127.919 --> 1136.0
making me more isolated drenching me

1132.96 --> 1139.76
in self-torture subconsciously

1136.0 --> 1144.0
yeah so oh trust the [ __ ] plan yeah

1139.76 --> 1146.64
trust the plan as i'm being mentally

1144.0 --> 1150.08
tortured on a level that most people can

1146.64 --> 1165.8400000000001
even realize just don't try

1150.08 --> 1165.84
it don't recommend it

1173.2 --> 1180.559
all right i'm i don't know i'm just

1178.08 --> 1181.12
i'm kind of getting to the point where i

1180.559 --> 1183.52
feel like

1181.12 --> 1186.799
just politically standing up and saying

1183.52 --> 1191.039
okay when are the heads gonna roll

1186.799 --> 1195.9189999999999
sick of it when are the heads gonna roll

1191.039 --> 1195.919
like not mediation

1196.0 --> 1203.28
not oh stable no when are the heads

1199.679 --> 1204.24
going to roll of this when is justice

1203.28 --> 1207.9189999999999
going to be met

1204.24 --> 1212.48
by a sharp point or whatever method

1207.919 --> 1215.2800000000002
it this [ __ ] has gone on for too long

1212.48 --> 1216.799
it has been gone on for too long for too

1215.28 --> 1220.0
long

1216.799 --> 1235.84
but it's just i'm getting at that

1220.0 --> 1235.84
point where i can't handle it anymore

1251.36 --> 1255.1999999999998
right because at this point it just what

1254.4 --> 1257.76
i do

1255.2 --> 1259.52
the worrying the figuring things out

1257.76 --> 1260.559
yeah i'm still enjoying a lot of

1259.52 --> 1264.24
creativity

1260.559 --> 1267.039
also and just the inner spirit from

1264.24 --> 1269.2
others that really do their best and

1267.039 --> 1270.24
just the complications and i am learning

1269.2 --> 1273.2
a lot yes but

1270.24 --> 1273.2
at the same time

1275.36 --> 1280.32
i feel very very trapped in this

1277.6 --> 1280.32
situation

1284.4 --> 1289.679
you could say a disposition of doing

1287.6 --> 1291.84
what i do

1289.679 --> 1294.159
and taking that series where everybody's

1291.84 --> 1297.9189999999999
just staring like oh this crazy artwork

1294.159 --> 1300.0
is just doing a silly show talking about

1297.919 --> 1301.039
things and what's so special about that

1300.0 --> 1304.24
well i am also

1301.039 --> 1306.1589999999999
freaking oracling i'm literally worrying

1304.24 --> 1306.799
for the world i'm trying to figure way

1306.159 --> 1310.0800000000002
through

1306.799 --> 1311.44
for my anchor point being humanity

1310.08 --> 1315.1999999999998
survival

1311.44 --> 1318.559
and original spirit survival

1315.2 --> 1320.88
right mankind with a spirit

1318.559 --> 1323.6789999999999
the original spirit that was handed to

1320.88 --> 1326.72
us at creation

1323.679 --> 1326.72
as it is being just

1326.799 --> 1333.84
mutilated every generation

1330.24 --> 1333.84
and i worry about it

1362.72 --> 1368.48
well terror306 mastered the laws

1366.08 --> 1369.12
of the functioning i think they just

1368.48 --> 1372.799
mastered

1369.12 --> 1375.84
the laws of social control

1372.799 --> 1377.9189999999999
i think it is pure hypnotism that keeps

1375.84 --> 1381.6
them in their place

1377.919 --> 1381.6000000000001
it's all social tricks

1383.039 --> 1386.48
because nobody in their right mind

1385.52 --> 1389.6
should tolerate

1386.48 --> 1394.159
any of that

1389.6 --> 1394.1589999999999
like no matter the the promises

1394.96 --> 1400.96
yet it continues on so it is look

1398.32 --> 1402.799
but as for as long as it takes you know

1400.96 --> 1404.88
even if it were a hundred years

1402.799 --> 1407.2
it's going to wear on the people that

1404.88 --> 1410.159
are actually actively upholding this

1407.2 --> 1412.0
one way or the other it's gonna wear on

1410.159 --> 1414.5590000000002
their

1412.0 --> 1416.4
on their soul on their guilt on those

1414.559 --> 1418.559
types of sensations or it's going to

1416.4 --> 1420.72
wear on their sanity

1418.559 --> 1424.0
as they sacrifice more and more of

1420.72 --> 1426.64
themselves just to become

1424.0 --> 1428.24
to be able to continue wielding that

1426.64 --> 1445.8400000000001
that

1428.24 --> 1445.84
raw dark power that it is becoming

1452.64 --> 1456.48
all we see is the bad guys yeah but

1454.4 --> 1460.24
that's also part of their

1456.48 --> 1463.6
that's their main trick though every

1460.24 --> 1466.159
success they have they flaunt it

1463.6 --> 1468.1589999999999
and they brag with it and they make us

1466.159 --> 1472.88
celebrate it

1468.159 --> 1476.3200000000002
well every yeah every defeat they have

1472.88 --> 1478.96
they they play like oh we're so poor

1476.32 --> 1479.52
why won't the bad people just work with

1478.96 --> 1483.44
us

1479.52 --> 1487.84
it's it's all just grabbler tactics

1483.44 --> 1487.8400000000001
all of it

1488.4 --> 1494.24
it's just control by telling people

1491.52 --> 1497.36
what to feel and think based on a system

1494.24 --> 1497.36
that kind of works

1498.64 --> 1504.7990000000002
you know providing the act the follow

1502.32 --> 1506.799
they want the followers to follow and

1504.799 --> 1509.84
then making it pleasing enough

1506.799 --> 1515.84
or just easy to grasp

1509.84 --> 1515.84
that's that trick

1526.84 --> 1529.84
so

1536.64 --> 1538.96
right

1540.559 --> 1547.84
but yeah it's

1543.6 --> 1550.48
i don't know i've tried to get away from

1547.84 --> 1550.48
this [ __ ]

1551.6 --> 1556.0
it's not really easy when everybody

1553.44 --> 1556.96
around you is pretty much dealing with

1556.0 --> 1571.6
the same

1556.96 --> 1574.4
things in the wrong way

1571.6 --> 1575.279
just yeah for me i'm trying to kind of

1574.4 --> 1578.72
in my head

1575.279 --> 1580.64
it's a secondary backup system trying to

1578.72 --> 1582.0
figure out a way to get away from all

1580.64 --> 1584.159
this in some way

1582.0 --> 1585.12
to get something completely separate

1584.159 --> 1588.72
where i could just

1585.12 --> 1593.12
let it all go i can't find it anymore

1588.72 --> 1593.1200000000001
guys i can't find it anymore

1596.08 --> 1601.36
i got nowhere to escape to there's just

1598.96 --> 1601.3600000000001
nothing

1604.559 --> 1608.559
like i'm gonna going to have to keep

1607.52 --> 1614.48
carrying this

1608.559 --> 1614.48
until it kills me or it just goes away

1617.36 --> 1627.84
i can't put down the weight anymore

1638.08 --> 1642.24
yeah like that i kind of do feel like

1640.399 --> 1646.399
freaking atlas

1642.24 --> 1655.84
being tricked to carry the world

1646.399 --> 1655.84
it almost does feel like that

1722.84 --> 1725.84
this

1745.44 --> 1753.8400000000001
down to mindset really is it

1771.44 --> 1781.6000000000001
they're feeling a bit shut no no it's

1773.919 --> 1786.72
not like that batman forever

1781.6 --> 1789.6789999999999
no i i don't physically feel shut in

1786.72 --> 1790.24
like of course i do still go out there

1789.679 --> 1795.039
i've

1790.24 --> 1798.32
plenty of beautiful nature to look at

1795.039 --> 1798.32
no it's just the people

1804.08 --> 1810.399
i'm just i have a very strong instinct

1807.44 --> 1813.2
that i kind of want to

1810.399 --> 1813.1999999999998
protect them

1813.76 --> 1816.32
in a way

1816.799 --> 1820.48
that i can do it by figuring out things

1819.76 --> 1824.0
how to fix

1820.48 --> 1827.52
things how to stabilize situations

1824.0 --> 1831.36
thinking worrying

1827.52 --> 1836.32
but i'm just presented with a situation

1831.36 --> 1838.799
where it's just

1836.32 --> 1841.6789999999999
like i i just don't know if it matters

1838.799 --> 1841.679
anymore really

1842.64 --> 1849.2
like yeah i'm encouraging

1845.84 --> 1851.279
others that already ready to learn

1849.2 --> 1852.64
woken up and then i look out there and

1851.279 --> 1855.36
it's like well

1852.64 --> 1856.48
there's people much more proficient at

1855.36 --> 1859.039
it

1856.48 --> 1859.039
than i am

1860.799 --> 1865.519
and then there's other people that are

1862.64 --> 1871.039
just anti-proficient

1865.519 --> 1872.559
and there's no use even trying that out

1871.039 --> 1875.36
and then i'm just feeling kind of

1872.559 --> 1875.36
useless here

1875.919 --> 1882.96
except maybe for yeah flat earth related

1879.84 --> 1884.8799999999999
details and physics and all that still

1882.96 --> 1886.96
have a bit of an edge there

1884.88 --> 1889.44
but it's even a little it's it's not

1886.96 --> 1892.799
even that impressive

1889.44 --> 1894.88
just i have my good moments in the swing

1892.799 --> 1896.72
energies and then when it's at its peak

1894.88 --> 1898.3200000000002
yeah it's really freaking good i know

1896.72 --> 1900.159
i'm very proud of that

1898.32 --> 1902.48
even though it's not really me it's just

1900.159 --> 1907.6000000000001
god giving me that

1902.48 --> 1910.08
you know

1907.6 --> 1911.4399999999998
i'm just having a lot of trouble finding

1910.08 --> 1913.9189999999999
some sensible

1911.44 --> 1913.919
purpose

1915.519 --> 1918.3990000000001
with what i got

1919.2 --> 1925.44
yeah what would bibi say i wonder i

1922.32 --> 1925.4399999999998
don't know what he would say

1931.039 --> 1949.84
i don't i i think he doesn't really

1935.84 --> 1949.84
you know it's not america

1951.279 --> 1956.64
like if my situation would be in america

1954.399 --> 1958.2399999999998
situation he told me that get out of the

1956.64 --> 1959.919
freaking big city

1958.24 --> 1963.36
which is basically what the netherlands

1959.919 --> 1967.279
is it's a big city

1963.36 --> 1970.32
and then like go into rural country and

1967.279 --> 1973.519
yeah other people other

1970.32 --> 1975.6789999999999
culture and i'd say yeah man that's

1973.519 --> 1991.84
that sounds great except i'm in the

1975.679 --> 1991.8400000000001
freaking netherlands

2003.279 --> 2010.24
and yeah i i want to meet a girl

2006.64 --> 2013.3600000000001
and basically start a family but in this

2010.24 --> 2013.36
freaking world man

2016.84 --> 2022.399
like

2019.44 --> 2023.679
like i can't imagine even a sensible

2022.399 --> 2026.1589999999999
woman at this point

2023.679 --> 2028.3200000000002
although i might just be wrong who knows

2026.159 --> 2029.0390000000002
what i'm gonna actually run into at some

2028.32 --> 2032.559
point

2029.039 --> 2035.76
maybe i'm just still too weak

2032.559 --> 2035.76
to even sense it

2036.24 --> 2039.44
now there's there's one woman that i

2038.399 --> 2043.039
know

2039.44 --> 2045.3600000000001
my friend from naimeh who is

2043.039 --> 2046.799
just kind of on my level and this

2045.36 --> 2050.399
literally just being

2046.799 --> 2052.72
very extremely on point

2050.399 --> 2054.56
like understanding like corona vaccine

2052.72 --> 2056.56
is not a vaccine like she knows

2054.56 --> 2060.0789999999997
everything you really need to know

2056.56 --> 2065.359
she's very well like she wasn't a an

2060.079 --> 2065.3590000000004
a plus student type in school

2066.0 --> 2070.0
and she's paying attention to what i'm

2068.079 --> 2072.159
saying with these things

2070.0 --> 2073.52
so like that shit's not gonna happen but

2072.159 --> 2076.48
at the same time it just

2073.52 --> 2079.359
totally she's dealing with the same

2076.48 --> 2079.359
issues as i am

2081.119 --> 2084.96
like just the entire world's going

2083.119 --> 2088.639
insane and like

2084.96 --> 2091.599
things like government is slipping

2088.639 --> 2103.839
people just losing their attention spans

2091.599 --> 2103.839
because of the pressure from all sides

2115.359 --> 2121.92
oh jesus clutch bear

2119.119 --> 2121.92
that sucks

2124.72 --> 2132.16
you are not there promise us

2128.32 --> 2135.44
what are you talking to me

2132.16 --> 2135.7599999999998
i hope not because i can already promise

2135.44 --> 2138.88
you

2135.76 --> 2145.44
like i i cannot commit suicide that's

2138.88 --> 2149.04
physically impossible

2145.44 --> 2152.56
i can go completely ape [ __ ] though

2149.04 --> 2155.04
but suicidal actions nope

2152.56 --> 2156.48
impossible i got like fail-safe

2155.04 --> 2159.04
mechanism for that

2156.48 --> 2160.96
it's absolutely impossible oh my god

2159.04 --> 2165.04
i've had

2160.96 --> 2169.92
things it's impossible

2165.04 --> 2169.92
just no matter what it's impossible

2171.04 --> 2177.7599999999998
like i can't fool myself

2174.079 --> 2182.4
in any way that would lead to my death

2177.76 --> 2185.8390000000004
it's impossible in a way i've tried

2182.4 --> 2186.64
way way back it's impossible there's a

2185.839 --> 2190.0789999999997
mechanism

2186.64 --> 2190.0789999999997
it's not possible

2191.52 --> 2198.96
i can't do it like i literally cannot

2195.76 --> 2201.119
it's physically impossible hey

2198.96 --> 2202.7200000000003
it's not gonna make me happier person

2201.119 --> 2204.96
though you know because

2202.72 --> 2205.9199999999996
yeah subjected by the same levels of

2204.96 --> 2208.48
stress

2205.92 --> 2209.44
that's why i've had periods where i

2208.48 --> 2212.48
literally

2209.44 --> 2215.44
hallucinate from the stress and the pain

2212.48 --> 2218.0
right that's the alternative it's not a

2215.44 --> 2220.88
very pleasant alternative i'll tell you

2218.0 --> 2223.92
but hey i'm still alive to share that

2220.88 --> 2226.8
information with you

2223.92 --> 2227.6800000000003
right and i'm talking about like six

2226.8 --> 2231.28
years ago

2227.68 --> 2231.2799999999997
i had that right here

2234.24 --> 2238.56
i shared that it was a crazy time

2240.0 --> 2243.04
i'm not there at that point i got a lot

2242.64 --> 2245.7599999999998
more

2243.04 --> 2246.56
stability inside to to deal with all of

2245.76 --> 2250.32
it

2246.56 --> 2256.24
but it's wearing on me literally

2250.32 --> 2258.1600000000003
wearing physically

2256.24 --> 2259.4399999999996
and i'm just trying to figure out like

2258.16 --> 2262.64
okay

2259.44 --> 2263.04
how long is this physically palpable how

2262.64 --> 2266.16
long

2263.04 --> 2269.119
can i physically hold out this level

2266.16 --> 2271.04
and thinking okay well maybe two weeks

2269.119 --> 2275.599
maybe a month

2271.04 --> 2279.7599999999998
maybe four months but what if

2275.599 --> 2285.839
like it gets worse now that's

2279.76 --> 2285.8390000000004
significantly gonna come back

2286.96 --> 2290.7200000000003
right and then there's the idea okay so

2289.76 --> 2293.599
what if this

2290.72 --> 2294.56
literally never stops is that physically

2293.599 --> 2298.2400000000002
achievable

2294.56 --> 2301.2
for the controllers to do that

2298.24 --> 2301.2
for the control

2301.359 --> 2309.44
i can't imagine it it's too much

2306.079 --> 2310.8390000000004
acceleration happening too many

2309.44 --> 2315.76
polarized

2310.839 --> 2315.7599999999998
results from this level of pressure

2315.839 --> 2319.7599999999998
but to me it's just like

2321.04 --> 2326.72
this may be simply generally described

2324.48 --> 2329.28
too much for me to handle

2326.72 --> 2330.0
like i can't physically handle this [ __ ]

2329.28 --> 2333.52
i'm

2330.0 --> 2333.52
going insane from all this

2334.4 --> 2338.0
and just mainly doing my best to not

2337.28 --> 2340.5600000000004
basically

2338.0 --> 2342.48
yell it out on other people and i'm

2340.56 --> 2346.96
doing extremely good at it

2342.48 --> 2355.2
being very good more control over myself

2346.96 --> 2357.359
than i've ever had

2355.2 --> 2360.0
right yeah clutch bear yeah sorry if i'm

2357.359 --> 2362.88
rolling over that's really sucky

2360.0 --> 2362.88
when did it happen

2364.96 --> 2373.52
right that's weird moth eyes

2368.32 --> 2373.52
my dreams are quite different

2379.04 --> 2387.119
it's w my dreams are strange because

2383.2 --> 2391.359
it's almost like

2387.119 --> 2391.359
dark world visions are continuing

2392.24 --> 2396.7999999999997
like my dreams are becoming like that a

2394.839 --> 2400.4
little

2396.8 --> 2403.44
and it's not even threatening because

2400.4 --> 2404.88
i don't know i whatever they did

2403.44 --> 2407.52
originally to me

2404.88 --> 2409.92
when that happened i think they probably

2407.52 --> 2412.4
injected certain type of substances that

2409.92 --> 2414.4
kind of made me

2412.4 --> 2416.56
not be able to uphold the barrier i

2414.4 --> 2416.96
don't have that part so i'm literally

2416.56 --> 2420.0789999999997
just

2416.96 --> 2422.079
experiencing like my visions but in full

2420.079 --> 2424.88
dream protection

2422.079 --> 2426.7200000000003
that's a big difference and that's i'm

2424.88 --> 2429.44
starting to figure this out now it's

2426.72 --> 2429.4399999999996
fascinating

2429.599 --> 2435.76
so yeah my dreams are kind of like a

2432.0 --> 2435.76
fifth dimensional holodeck

2435.92 --> 2439.76
where i do the same thing as i always do

2438.64 --> 2442.7999999999997
i worry

2439.76 --> 2446.1600000000003
it's not letting go and then

2442.8 --> 2447.599
it's just starting to crystallize within

2446.16 --> 2450.16
the dream instead of

2447.599 --> 2451.04
waking dreamwalking that i do a lot of

2450.16 --> 2452.8799999999997
the time

2451.04 --> 2455.2799999999997
worrying about it walking back and forth

2452.88 --> 2457.76
thinking about it

2455.28 --> 2460.8
right it happens in my dreams except

2457.76 --> 2460.8
with the holographic

2464.839 --> 2467.839
representation

2471.04 --> 2475.839
walking zombie right well sir george

2474.079 --> 2481.8390000000004
sanford with me i don't know

2475.839 --> 2481.839
they're not even in my dreams anymore

2488.079 --> 2494.079
like i i'm not

2492.24 --> 2497.2
i've already reconciled with that

2494.079 --> 2500.88
they're they're just gone

2497.2 --> 2500.8799999999997
i have it's just that

2501.28 --> 2510.3190000000004
my psyche has a bit trouble dealing

2505.92 --> 2513.04
with still having to socialize with it

2510.319 --> 2515.52
be natural while at the same time

2513.04 --> 2519.68
knowing what i know about the future

2515.52 --> 2522.319
and nobody wanting to listen that part

2519.68 --> 2524.56
that's where the difficulty coming you

2522.319 --> 2525.68
know if they'd literally all drop dead

2524.56 --> 2528.64
just like that oh

2525.68 --> 2528.64
giant shockwave

2529.52 --> 2533.52
and yeah that would all happen quickly

2532.16 --> 2538.0
then i'd be

2533.52 --> 2542.0
oh thank god it's freaking finally over

2538.0 --> 2543.92
because i knew the if that would happen

2542.0 --> 2545.68
then i would have known like yes

2543.92 --> 2547.119
something like that over time would

2545.68 --> 2549.9199999999996
probably happen anyway

2547.119 --> 2550.4
except yeah we still have to deal with

2549.92 --> 2555.359
them

2550.4 --> 2555.359
until then oh

2562.839 --> 2565.839
god

2575.28 --> 2579.8390000000004
two years ago hmm

2583.68 --> 2588.16
right i get it clutch bear it's really

2590.839 --> 2596.64
terrible

2593.839 --> 2597.2
like i had a nephew that that did that

2596.64 --> 2600.4
too but

2597.2 --> 2602.64
he was like like chronic with it

2600.4 --> 2607.839
for some time so like everybody did kind

2602.64 --> 2607.839
of see it coming it's different maybe

2611.68 --> 2618.56
but it it just chucks and it it's it

2614.56 --> 2618.56
sucks and it's very shocking and just

2618.64 --> 2635.839
it's like this cold breeze coming over

2620.88 --> 2635.839
you when that happens

2641.68 --> 2645.2
but anyway come on let's

2646.079 --> 2663.8390000000004
i i want to get out of this [ __ ]

2650.319 --> 2663.839
oh god

2673.68 --> 2676.8799999999997
hey all right iron 26 you watch vanilla

2676.4 --> 2682.48
sky

2676.88 --> 2682.48
yeah it is it is pretty intense isn't it

2684.4 --> 2691.839
i agree

2692.88 --> 2696.319
but it's also it like it plays in on

2695.839 --> 2699.92
dream

2696.319 --> 2702.72
fantasizing a lot and it kind of like

2699.92 --> 2704.0
draws you into that spell and then

2702.72 --> 2707.359
shocks you like with

2704.0 --> 2709.92
the hallucinatory things like yeah so

2707.359 --> 2709.92
it's very

2710.4 --> 2716.839
covert thriller like that that's very

2713.68 --> 2719.839
psychological thriller in a way

2716.839 --> 2719.839
too

2734.8 --> 2747.8390000000004
right anyway hello dutch sailor

2772.839 --> 2775.839
ah

2782.0 --> 2787.119
this is kind of funny like i'm looking

2784.4 --> 2790.2400000000002
at the background right now of my show

2787.119 --> 2791.119
it's all dark in there and then i

2790.24 --> 2793.4399999999996
realize again

2791.119 --> 2794.48
like yeah the the animation basically

2793.44 --> 2798.0
has an hour

2794.48 --> 2800.64
cycle an hour day night cycle

2798.0 --> 2802.64
and it's funny because because of it i

2800.64 --> 2805.1189999999997
can now

2802.64 --> 2806.72
use the background of my show to tell

2805.119 --> 2810.079
what time it is without

2806.72 --> 2810.8799999999997
actually looking at the time so i'm

2810.079 --> 2814.4
using like

2810.88 --> 2814.4
celestial intuition

2815.2 --> 2820.16
like how people know the time before

2817.119 --> 2820.1600000000003
clocks and all that

2820.88 --> 2826.56
i'm using it on the animation

2824.64 --> 2831.839
to figure out like oh yeah i think i've

2826.56 --> 2831.839
almost done an hour now

2842.839 --> 2845.839
hmm

2853.44 --> 2859.839
kurt russell what

2864.96 --> 2873.839
is it kurt russell where

2869.44 --> 2873.839
don't you mean

2876.079 --> 2880.88
the other guy the other actor isn't that

2878.64 --> 2883.52
kurt russell in that movie

2880.88 --> 2883.52
that's weird

2883.92 --> 2887.839
it's a tom cruise right

2900.96 --> 2907.04
oh wait you mean the

2904.4 --> 2910.1600000000003
right the shrink yeah yeah now i

2907.04 --> 2910.16
remember yeah you're right

2911.839 --> 2917.2799999999997
yeah he came in in the end

2915.76 --> 2919.3590000000004
but yeah it's been a while since i've

2917.28 --> 2920.2400000000002
seen that movie i should probably watch

2919.359 --> 2922.88
it again

2920.24 --> 2925.2799999999997
if i'm in the mood for it it is kind of

2922.88 --> 2925.28
tense

2926.839 --> 2929.839
dramatic

2940.839 --> 2943.839
do

2968.839 --> 2971.839
hmm

2972.96 --> 2976.079
okay moth eyes

2981.76 --> 2985.8390000000004
is it really good though

2990.72 --> 2994.319
i kind of thought that his books overall

2993.44 --> 2998.8
were

2994.319 --> 3000.64
really convoluted like

2998.8 --> 3004.0
just a whole bunch of things that are

3000.64 --> 3004.0
not that are out of whack

3004.319 --> 3008.96
but i don't know

3011.04 --> 3017.68
like 20 years ago that book did or

3014.319 --> 3019.68
it's another one uh one of the bigger

3017.68 --> 3024.24
ones

3019.68 --> 3024.24
i did read that a big part of it

3024.96 --> 3030.8
and yeah did i thought

3028.48 --> 3032.88
that it was interesting how it basically

3030.8 --> 3036.559
attempted to

3032.88 --> 3039.04
yeah lay down the esoteric unspoken

3036.559 --> 3041.8390000000004
things to give that structure somehow

3039.04 --> 3043.839
so that's that what was what i thought

3041.839 --> 3044.4
was good about it it's just that the way

3043.839 --> 3049.119
they did

3044.4 --> 3055.839
he did it like i don't agree with that

3049.119 --> 3055.839
he's a luciferian it just is

3066.839 --> 3071.359
hmm

3068.88 --> 3071.359
really

3080.839 --> 3083.839
okay

3084.48 --> 3087.119
that's funny

3087.76 --> 3091.0400000000004
i always just use my intuition i could

3089.839 --> 3093.52
just feel it you know

3091.04 --> 3095.44
no black magic without intention it's

3093.52 --> 3097.119
always the intention and then trying to

3095.44 --> 3111.839
hide it

3097.119 --> 3111.839
i could just feel it i yeah

3146.4 --> 3153.839
what's going on here

3180.16 --> 3183.1189999999997
ah i knew it

3192.64 --> 3196.16
right mouth eyes well look if you got

3195.119 --> 3200.0
something out of it

3196.16 --> 3203.359
it's always good to have more sources

3200.0 --> 3205.76
even if just to compare it all afterward

3203.359 --> 3207.119
and say like okay they're all pointing

3205.76 --> 3210.0
at the same things

3207.119 --> 3211.359
it's just that this guy and that one are

3210.0 --> 3214.4
like a little devious

3211.359 --> 3215.359
and they're obviously not very moral you

3214.4 --> 3216.96
know

3215.359 --> 3218.64
so it's always good to have multiple

3216.96 --> 3221.28
sources just to be able to

3218.64 --> 3223.7599999999998
cross-reference the data

3221.28 --> 3224.96
and not have all the data through one

3223.76 --> 3230.0
singular source

3224.96 --> 3234.96
in one style so you can differentiate

3230.0 --> 3234.96
the character behind yeah

3235.68 --> 3239.9199999999996
the [ __ ] behind the relay better

3240.8 --> 3243.2000000000003
anyway

3248.4 --> 3253.359
i myself i look i need to

3251.44 --> 3254.88
get some reading material from rudolf

3253.359 --> 3257.2
steiner

3254.88 --> 3257.92
it's been advised to me from multiple

3257.2 --> 3261.359
sources

3257.92 --> 3263.6800000000003
i don't really have anything of him

3261.359 --> 3264.48
but i do know that almost everything

3263.68 --> 3267.44
i've ever

3264.48 --> 3268.8
gazed on that was written by him i just

3267.44 --> 3271.92
outright agreed

3268.8 --> 3275.119
or i was like ah yeah i know

3271.92 --> 3279.839
i'm not there yet shut up it was always

3275.119 --> 3279.839
either responses so

3308.0 --> 3313.76
no monthlies that's that's not really

3310.72 --> 3313.7599999999998
possible i think

3317.839 --> 3324.799
like you can't do it without knowing

3321.839 --> 3327.92
that's the whole thing about it it's a

3324.799 --> 3327.92
spirit that does it

3329.119 --> 3334.079
it can't happen without your

3332.839 --> 3336.88
consciousness

3334.079 --> 3338.799
now you could fool yourself into

3336.88 --> 3340.319
thinking it's something else is what it

3338.799 --> 3345.2
really is

3340.319 --> 3345.2
but it can be done without the conscious

3345.839 --> 3350.64
i yeah i tested this [ __ ]

3353.04 --> 3358.0
like way way back 20 years ago

3361.119 --> 3377.839
and it's morning at the early word show

3384.079 --> 3388.8390000000004
wait planting seeds in someone is a form

3387.52 --> 3391.839
of black magic

3388.839 --> 3391.839
what

3392.4 --> 3398.319
you mean literal seeds probably ideas i

3395.839 --> 3398.319
take it

3402.839 --> 3405.839
what

3416.319 --> 3420.72
right well yes mouth ice

3421.119 --> 3427.92
but that's not black magic

3424.559 --> 3432.2400000000002
then planting a seed it's just that

3427.92 --> 3435.28
if you have a very specific idea

3432.24 --> 3438.4799999999996
and you plant the seeds of that idea

3435.28 --> 3441.6800000000003
you got to realize that

3438.48 --> 3445.839
let's just metamorphize it into a

3441.68 --> 3447.52
bushel if you put that bushel in

3445.839 --> 3450.0
somebody's mind

3447.52 --> 3450.559
it's gonna go through all seasons if it

3450.0 --> 3453.2
really

3450.559 --> 3456.3190000000004
manifests right so just because you have

3453.2 --> 3458.5589999999997
a specific vision in mind doesn't mean

3456.319 --> 3459.599
that there's not gonna be other phases

3458.559 --> 3461.599
as well

3459.599 --> 3463.28
and so you've got to always realize that

3461.599 --> 3465.839
whatever idea you

3463.28 --> 3466.799
share you got to realize the wider

3465.839 --> 3470.0789999999997
implications

3466.799 --> 3470.88
the phases by which that idea will be

3470.079 --> 3475.8390000000004
touched

3470.88 --> 3475.839
within a person right

3476.4 --> 3480.48
now in my opinion black magic would come

3479.2 --> 3484.0789999999997
in

3480.48 --> 3487.359
when you knowingly

3484.079 --> 3489.28
share an idea that is presented as

3487.359 --> 3492.5589999999997
really nice

3489.28 --> 3495.76
but which you know when cycling

3492.559 --> 3498.7200000000003
through the other faces will have dark

3495.76 --> 3501.28
conjuring responses

3498.72 --> 3503.2
without saying it by presenting it oh

3501.28 --> 3506.2400000000002
it's all nice

3503.2 --> 3509.04
that is black magic not

3506.24 --> 3510.0
seeding seeding in general not black

3509.04 --> 3513.44
magic it's called

3510.0 --> 3516.559
sharing an idea not black magic

3513.44 --> 3519.839
see no it's when you

3516.559 --> 3521.3590000000004
knowingly present something as if it is

3519.839 --> 3523.68
nice

3521.359 --> 3525.04
when you know that through the cycles in

3523.68 --> 3528.3999999999996
somebody's mind

3525.04 --> 3529.68
it's going to have very dark acting

3528.4 --> 3533.2000000000003
responses

3529.68 --> 3533.2
and then not

3533.359 --> 3537.04
yeah keeping that a secret

3539.599 --> 3546.7200000000003
right that's where black magic come in

3543.839 --> 3548.96
see how unbelievably specific i got with

3546.72 --> 3548.9599999999996
that

3550.96 --> 3555.68
and that was a big problem with me with

3556.0 --> 3561.76
manly p hall it's just he over

3559.76 --> 3564.2400000000002
generalized the [ __ ] out of things and

3561.76 --> 3566.96
he did not he did not have the freaking

3564.24 --> 3568.799
feeling for the subtle details over

3566.96 --> 3572.16
generalizer he was such an over

3568.799 --> 3576.319
generalizer to yeah

3572.16 --> 3576.319
socially inept levels

3579.359 --> 3587.839
and that's what i didn't like about him

3592.0 --> 3597.119
all right fellow lambo cannon you get it

3594.72 --> 3597.1189999999997
i guess

3598.16 --> 3602.24
like family p hall really wasn't that

3600.88 --> 3606.2400000000002
special

3602.24 --> 3606.24
he was just a freaking club boy

3606.319 --> 3611.44
and he was like one of the guys one of

3608.72 --> 3615.1189999999997
the bros being held up

3611.44 --> 3629.839
but he wasn't freaking special

3615.119 --> 3629.839
pretty sure he was just a dick

3638.48 --> 3645.44
well moth eyes when you seed an idea

3642.24 --> 3645.9199999999996
and you realize the phases in which the

3645.44 --> 3649.119
seed

3645.92 --> 3652.319
will flourish and do things

3649.119 --> 3653.28
and you have to be conscious of all the

3652.319 --> 3656.16
seasons

3653.28 --> 3657.2000000000003
when you hand over the seat you gotta

3656.16 --> 3659.839
tell

3657.2 --> 3661.359
it's just like the person that has an

3659.839 --> 3663.68
archery or something

3661.359 --> 3664.96
you gotta tell them it's like yeah i'm

3663.68 --> 3668.3999999999996
giving you this

3664.96 --> 3670.559
this fruit right plant it

3668.4 --> 3672.4
you're not just gonna tell yeah oh man

3670.559 --> 3674.0
just the first thing's gonna happen it's

3672.4 --> 3675.92
gonna grow and then the fruits it's

3674.0 --> 3679.119
never gonna stop

3675.92 --> 3679.92
yeah that's [ __ ] no you gotta tell

3679.119 --> 3684.0
them

3679.92 --> 3686.4
the phases what can they expect

3684.0 --> 3687.359
right then it becomes sharing the

3686.4 --> 3690.559
information

3687.359 --> 3693.839
complete information

3690.559 --> 3695.6800000000003
that's the way you plan to see mentally

3693.839 --> 3699.2
as well

3695.68 --> 3702.0
share an idea and you already

3699.2 --> 3703.4399999999996
share the implications what you can

3702.0 --> 3706.319
expect

3703.44 --> 3707.04
so that somebody can handle the idea

3706.319 --> 3713.839
properly

3707.04 --> 3717.0389999999998
through the different phases

3713.839 --> 3720.0789999999997
now if you hand them an idea

3717.039 --> 3723.28
and then with that idea hand over a

3720.079 --> 3725.4
false expectation like

3723.28 --> 3727.039
some kind of ideological

3725.4 --> 3729.44
oversimplification

3727.039 --> 3730.6400000000003
that's when dark magic comes in because

3729.44 --> 3732.799
then

3730.64 --> 3734.24
a person is discontorted in their

3732.799 --> 3739.2
insight with the

3734.24 --> 3742.24
handed over information the seed

3739.2 --> 3744.64
and then they will have a this

3742.24 --> 3746.9599999999996
yeah this contortion a cognitive

3744.64 --> 3750.72
dissonance element

3746.96 --> 3753.68
like within that

3750.72 --> 3755.2799999999997
and that cognitive dissonance element is

3753.68 --> 3758.48
like

3755.28 --> 3762.0
a little spot in which a demon can just

3758.48 --> 3764.48
take control there take over because

3762.0 --> 3767.359
it's broken

3764.48 --> 3769.839
right that's dark magic that's the big

3767.359 --> 3769.839
difference

3785.68 --> 3787.9199999999996
uh

3792.079 --> 3797.8390000000004
i i don't know about that but

3812.559 --> 3825.8390000000004
i don't see like offering a tree what

3815.44 --> 3825.839
how does that make any sense

3840.48 --> 3843.359
yeah anyway

3850.839 --> 3856.64
hey

3852.4 --> 3860.88
yeah so it's been a pretty intense

3856.64 --> 3863.7599999999998
show overall i guess that i've

3860.88 --> 3866.0
kind of shared part of my burden with

3863.76 --> 3869.2000000000003
you guys

3866.0 --> 3871.52
and some interesting occult

3869.2 --> 3871.52
talk

3872.799 --> 3881.839
about this

3894.0 --> 3900.88
huh right yeah control

3897.839 --> 3904.72
burns to prevent the total

3900.88 --> 3907.28
burn down right that's all about the

3904.72 --> 3911.839
intention again

3907.28 --> 3911.8390000000004
it's not about the action it's about why

3916.48 --> 3919.68
and if you hand over an idea to

3918.64 --> 3922.4
basically

3919.68 --> 3923.68
hand over an idea and to make somebody

3922.4 --> 3926.7200000000003
able

3923.68 --> 3929.44
to deal with it then

3926.72 --> 3931.839
is good if you hand over somebody an

3929.44 --> 3932.079
idea to basically trap them in some kind

3931.839 --> 3935.839
of

3932.079 --> 3939.039
ideology delusion then it's black magic

3935.839 --> 3942.24
you're literally trying to [ __ ] them

3939.039 --> 3944.079
it's false ideas and cognitive

3942.24 --> 3948.839
dissonance

3944.079 --> 3951.8390000000004
that's that's already black magic in my

3948.839 --> 3951.839
book

3954.96 --> 3959.599
