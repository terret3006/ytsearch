also do support me through the PayPal

61.72 --> 68.65
page run my GoFundMe and super chat that

64.54 --> 73.0
would be much appreciated so today the

68.65 --> 75.49000000000001
weather is pretty credible still some

73.0 --> 83.08
chemtrails over there in the back but it

75.49 --> 89.35
seems I've now pretty beautiful and yeah

83.08 --> 92.649
some people yeah taking picnics it seems

89.35 --> 94.3
to be something some more people do over

92.649 --> 97.75
there on a regular basis and with this

94.3 --> 101.77
weather yeah it seems great I wish I

97.75 --> 106.72
could get my D&D friends to do the same

101.77 --> 109.72
thing but quarantine would be so great

106.72 --> 112.96
to just get out there on the grass maybe

109.72 --> 117.28
in the shade and just play some DD the

112.96 --> 121.689
really fresh air what oh well yes I have

117.28 --> 124.99
to wait until midsummer yeah amazing day

121.689 --> 127.36
not a lot of wind it's just it feels

124.99 --> 129.96
like a summer day it's really awesome

127.36 --> 129.96
outside

133.87 --> 145.61
yeah so I got green tea with me let's

141.56 --> 147.4
see who is in chat starting slightly

145.61 --> 152.35000000000002
early

147.4 --> 157.82
la TARTA was first they like oh hi oh

152.35 --> 164.9
good servant that's it so far see who

157.82 --> 171.92
else drops in 15 watching right now yo

164.9 --> 177.53
but yeah I bumped into an article from

171.92 --> 179.92999999999998
RT that I generally I have some problems

177.53 --> 185.39000000000001
with them because I've noticed that

179.93 --> 188.93
certain like they they highly edit that

185.39 --> 193.04
yeah it's like really heavily but they

188.93 --> 196.58
did post this article concerning the g5

193.04 --> 198.95
towers now apparently in Friesland in

196.58 --> 201.17000000000002
the Netherlands also getting assaulted I

198.95 --> 203.04999999999998
think they had some of that install over

201.17 --> 205.97
there pretty much against their will

203.05 --> 208.19
partially corporate decision type

205.97 --> 210.53
situation and they're now doing

208.19 --> 214.55
something about that as well taking the

210.53 --> 215.21
momentum as it were and kind of glad to

214.55 --> 217.85000000000002
hear it

215.21 --> 220.16
I hope it doesn't lead to too much to I

217.85 --> 223.37
hope it actually leads to some success

220.16 --> 227.15
and not just more cracking down that

223.37 --> 231.71
will be bad I hope this is gonna work

227.15 --> 233.87
out but yeah it was interesting to see

231.71 --> 239.15
in the in the chat section of that

233.87 --> 240.8
article that people were yeah allowed to

239.15 --> 243.58
basically speak their mind to say like

240.8 --> 246.38000000000002
yeah screw you Artie and your stupid

243.58 --> 248.87
status nonsense like nobody wants it

246.38 --> 252.47
it's useless it's bad and like the whole

248.87 --> 255.02
works was in there in check and nothing

252.47 --> 258.83
really was blocked but in order other

255.02 --> 262.479
articles like yesterday some coronavirus

258.83 --> 265.90999999999997
related article if you just say even

262.479 --> 269.51
very modestly like corona is fake

265.91 --> 273.65000000000003
or these stats are false if you just

269.51 --> 276.55
anything like that and without

273.65 --> 279.53
immediately straw Manning into a sight

276.55 --> 282.05
line thing inside issue a presupposition

279.53 --> 284.59999999999997
issue that it is really going on but

282.05 --> 286.91
some other things are to blame that kind

284.6 --> 289.19
of thinking you know if you didn't

286.91 --> 293.36
sidetrack to that and just say no this

289.19 --> 295.4
is all a false SIOP and this and this

293.36 --> 297.91
and that they just immediately delete

295.4 --> 302.45
you immediately if you complain about

297.91 --> 304.22
such immediately it's doesn't matter if

302.45 --> 306.65
you're not being trollish about it and

304.22 --> 310.97
it's just heavy heavy censorship that

306.65 --> 316.78999999999996
really pissed me off it's like really no

310.97 --> 320.3
dissenting voices it just doesn't feel

316.79 --> 327.5
right it's not the RT that that I knew

320.3 --> 330.7
ten years ago but yeah they posted this

327.5 --> 334.58
article so there's something with that

330.7 --> 337.72999999999996
apparently 5g is sort of a tests case

334.58 --> 342.2
thing where revolution is sort of

337.73 --> 346.1
allowed so it seems because yeah if it

342.2 --> 347.63
wasn't it would just be absolutely no

346.1 --> 349.37
not a word about it it would be

347.63 --> 351.11
everything would be taken down that kind

349.37 --> 354.05
of [ __ ] but apparently this is the thing

351.11 --> 358.04
that we are allowed it's the grass roots

354.05 --> 360.85
publics it's the conspiracy theorists to

358.04 --> 360.85
fight over it

362.52 --> 371.69
and with Corona not so much that that

368.25 --> 376.08
narrative seems to be high tension and

371.69 --> 377.759
they do not really tolerate dissenting

376.08 --> 379.919
voices not if they're getting too loud

377.759 --> 381.81
like you can complain because everybody

379.919 --> 383.94
can complain you know do your kana me

381.81 --> 385.62
there's so much issues to complain what

383.94 --> 389.099
if you kind of say like this is all fake

385.62 --> 391.11
this is nonsense or like we don't trust

389.099 --> 396.599
the medical system we don't want your

391.11 --> 398.49
vaccines then yeah you get you get a

396.599 --> 399.99
slap on the fingers like no you're not

398.49 --> 402.569
that's wrong thing

399.99 --> 404.639
you're not supposed to do that you're

402.569 --> 406.28900000000004
hurting people blah blah blah all kinds

404.639 --> 412.919
of excuses why we're supposed to be

406.289 --> 417.3
silencing you right 5g I don't know it's

412.919 --> 420.539
slightly different it seems on the other

417.3 --> 423.18
hand yeah maybe this is like a giant

420.539 --> 426.03
societal mousetrap there this could be

423.18 --> 429.36
the case as well I've realized that the

426.03 --> 433.77
thing is is that I'm on to 5g and

429.36 --> 436.62
against it for personal experience based

433.77 --> 441.50899999999996
reasons as I said I felt that [ __ ] it's

436.62 --> 443.279
terrible it's like it it's tough to

441.509 --> 448.349
describe like I don't even want to

443.279 --> 451.05
remember it like that being in the

448.349 --> 455.34
presence of these things like I

451.05 --> 457.86
literally look for copper I start to

455.34 --> 460.73999999999995
look for cover instinctively because it

457.86 --> 464.909
hurts just being in the direct line of

460.74 --> 469.29
sight with those towers the bad ones the

464.909 --> 471.75
big ones anyway

469.29 --> 477.0
so that's my reason for doing it but

471.75 --> 480.39
maybe this is like a they're letting it

477.0 --> 484.23
out in the open to attack specifically

480.39 --> 487.08
afterward like they're gonna I don't

484.23 --> 490.17
know maybe yeah I don't know it could go

487.08 --> 493.32
either way guys it could go either way

490.17 --> 495.87
it could be that people basically get a

493.32 --> 502.44
grip over it and just say no this is not

495.87 --> 505.65
gonna happen it's out of here or or yeah

502.44 --> 507.3
the government can mobilize the to go

505.65 --> 512.22
along to get along

507.3 --> 515.04
Nene public - basically yeah clamp down

512.22 --> 516.6
on the conspiracy theorist and all their

515.04 --> 519.3
vendor lists they're anarchists they're

516.6 --> 521.479
whatever they're gonna call us just

519.3 --> 528.17
shove it all on that one big pile of

521.479 --> 532.74
evil in the 90-84 doublethink world and

528.17 --> 536.64
then yeah really crack down upon us

532.74 --> 540.57
using the the newly used police tape

536.64 --> 545.16
measures and fold it through Corona I'm

540.57 --> 548.1600000000001
serious guys this is it's dangerous but

545.16 --> 549.93
it's it's this is yeah we're under

548.16 --> 553.3199999999999
assault so you got to defend yourself

549.93 --> 556.14
and whether we are being allowed to do

553.32 --> 559.4100000000001
this to then attack us for that

556.14 --> 563.28
afterward or that this is like an

559.41 --> 566.61
alteration in the program due to popular

563.28 --> 571.98
spiritual worldwide vote you could call

566.61 --> 577.19
it I don't know I don't know it doesn't

571.98 --> 580.98
really matter anymore not to me anyway

577.19 --> 584.0100000000001
these things they it has to stop nobody

580.98 --> 588.58
needs 5g nobody

584.01 --> 591.1899999999999
and I don't mind if if me saying that

588.58 --> 594.8100000000001
might be clipped and repeated endlessly

591.19 --> 597.25
in the future after whatever happens

594.81 --> 601.5699999999999
because nobody needs it

597.25 --> 608.83
nobody only evil and freaking lazy

601.57 --> 622.33
people needed nobody needs it kills life

608.83 --> 624.82
it's bad for everything you know if

622.33 --> 627.7900000000001
people want to bombard themselves all

624.82 --> 629.5600000000001
day long with with Wi-Fi and [ __ ] in

627.79 --> 633.73
their room in their little room that's

629.56 --> 635.77
that's all fine you know you do that but

633.73 --> 637.63
I'd almost be inclined to say okay let's

635.77 --> 639.46
make some rules for that and say okay

637.63 --> 642.6
you are gonna use these devices that's

639.46 --> 646.0300000000001
fine you're gonna have to cage

642.6 --> 649.1800000000001
electromagnetically your house so that

646.03 --> 652.3199999999999
you don't potentially damage your

649.18 --> 657.31
neighbor's with the excess radiation

652.32 --> 661.48
yeah that would be my approach yeah I'm

657.31 --> 663.76
that guy I'm I'm pretty extremely

661.48 --> 664.9
conservative conservative concerning is

663.76 --> 666.73
I always have been

664.9 --> 669.67
guess what doesn't make me all that

666.73 --> 672.52
popular with a lot of sci-fi guys you

669.67 --> 675.76
know they don't they want that they want

672.52 --> 677.8
the freakin wireless [ __ ] in everything

675.76 --> 680.59
they they put a wireless thing in the

677.8 --> 686.0999999999999
middle of their brain if they could they

680.59 --> 688.5600000000001
don't care there's people like that

686.1 --> 698.0690000000001
and I had bum pinch with them in the

688.56 --> 702.75
past yeah but yeah if it were up to me

698.069 --> 707.55
it it would be tolerated to a limited

702.75 --> 709.5
degree like personal use when you when

707.55 --> 711.63
you can't damage others with it like

709.5 --> 714.18
okay you want Wi-Fi [ __ ] that's fine do

711.63 --> 718.319
it all in your house make sure you can't

714.18 --> 722.91
damage others caging it you know and

718.319 --> 727.74
yeah that's fine but don't force these

722.91 --> 732.18
giant radiating towers on everyone so

727.74 --> 735.0
much or under specific contract with

732.18 --> 736.8889999999999
yeah with medical responsibility that

735.0 --> 742.68
comes with it and all that clarity real

736.889 --> 747.5600000000001
just get it real and yeah no more find

742.68 --> 751.05
no local Wi-Fi stuff you know in a way

747.56 --> 753.569
no local 5g because in a way it is kind

751.05 --> 759.24
of just like Wi-Fi but it is like public

753.569 --> 761.79
Wi-Fi it it's just bad contain it have

759.24 --> 764.399
places where you can grab your mobile

761.79 --> 767.459
whatever that have the capability for it

764.399 --> 770.579
and do it in places but make sure it

767.459 --> 772.7689999999999
doesn't radiate off in the surrounding

770.579 --> 778.17
because the more of these radiating

772.769 --> 784.019
fields happen it overlaps a lot like if

778.17 --> 786.81
you have a flat apartment and everybody

784.019 --> 789.139
has a freaking Wi-Fi you can have like

786.81 --> 792.449
three four five six

789.139 --> 794.67
Wi-Fi field stacking over one another at

792.449 --> 798.06
a certain time if you sit in that for a

794.67 --> 804.63
day is that's a very bad influence it

798.06 --> 809.0999999999999
does I don't like it in in in general

804.63 --> 811.579
flat apart I never did but I now just

809.1 --> 814.8000000000001
happen to be sitting at this unique

811.579 --> 818.6099999999999
location in this flat apartment where I

814.8 --> 819.25
am relatively far away from most Wi-Fi

818.61 --> 822.13
trends

819.25 --> 824.35
meters in in the house because I'm

822.13 --> 826.57
freaking aware where they are okay I

824.35 --> 830.1700000000001
know one is there that's probably the

826.57 --> 832.8100000000001
close by is this house blocks the Wi-Fi

830.17 --> 834.49
ready the closest one is proximately

832.81 --> 838.3599999999999
that distance beneath me

834.49 --> 839.92
and over there probably even further

838.36 --> 843.04
away so they're all I'm like at a

839.92 --> 845.5899999999999
maximum distance I got no Wi-Fi from

843.04 --> 846.55
that direction because it's somewhere

845.59 --> 851.8000000000001
else over there

846.55 --> 854.38
so I'm sitting in a minimum spot and

851.8 --> 858.16
that makes this relatively survivable

854.38 --> 863.2
for me I'm really lucky like that it

858.16 --> 865.4499999999999
just happened to work out and I did even

863.2 --> 868.51
study yeah I've been on to radiation

865.45 --> 870.9300000000001
danger for a long time so when I came

868.51 --> 873.25
here I made that very clear like I don't

870.93 --> 875.17
want to be Wi-Fi too but you're not

873.25 --> 877.57
gonna force me to use Wi-Fi I'm a

875.17 --> 881.74
computer no matter what you're not gonna

877.57 --> 885.13
do it and I've managed to be able to do

881.74 --> 893.83
it without because this is real people

885.13 --> 897.37
okay sorry cousin Tina how can you tell

893.83 --> 903.2800000000001
if a tower is 5g it's it's kind of tough

897.37 --> 905.92
to tell you have to be good really what

903.28 --> 908.23
is it determining the the type of

905.92 --> 912.25
technology I'm not the expert okay not

908.23 --> 914.79
an electronics expert at all but yeah

912.25 --> 920.65
there's plenty of people around that are

914.79 --> 922.75
from what I've gathered yeah there's

920.65 --> 927.8199999999999
different types of approaches to the

922.75 --> 929.83
system and yeah the problem is is even

927.82 --> 932.0500000000001
with like telephone towers they've

929.83 --> 938.0500000000001
become a mix of all kinds of things it's

932.05 --> 940.4799999999999
like 3G 4G and other things even that

938.05 --> 944.02
are kind of classified in those thing 5g

940.48 --> 948.4
towers I don't know I don't think

944.02 --> 951.64
they're here in this city not that I've

948.4 --> 952.39
come across because when I did I get it

951.64 --> 955.54
in

952.39 --> 958.86
north of Netherlands had that they've

955.54 --> 962.38
rarely come there anyway and in Germany

958.86 --> 966.4
it's like you're walking into a tension

962.38 --> 969.61
field it's like and I just I

966.4 --> 974.4599999999999
yeah it's not over here that's all I can

969.61 --> 980.29
say so I don't know for me it could be a

974.46 --> 982.3000000000001
why are a 5g tower a big one I don't

980.29 --> 984.16
think they are really big ones though I

982.3 --> 992.65
think they're mostly just small local

984.16 --> 996.7199999999999
things right but the big ones yeah III

992.65 --> 999.25
don't know how to determine what type of

996.72 --> 1002.46
signals are coming off those things I

999.25 --> 1012.09
could only sense like how much is coming

1002.46 --> 1015.57
off it that's it Sean Daniel yeah yeah

1012.09 --> 1019.3100000000001
well it's it's like Gaea shifters video

1015.57 --> 1022.83
title says so like yeah just let's just

1019.31 --> 1028.49
kill a few million people for a faster

1022.83 --> 1028.49
for a faster internet yeah

1037.32 --> 1040.32
okay

1041.089 --> 1048.289
oh by the way thank you sorry tech

1044.029 --> 1058.19
Cosentino yeah I don't take crap I don't

1048.289 --> 1062.72
I really don't you know but yeah I think

1058.19 --> 1065.8400000000001
things are kind of I think Nathan Scott

1062.72 --> 1067.009
and understand he knows like his

1065.84 --> 1069.98
personal choice

1067.009 --> 1072.679
that's his his thing and he is like

1069.98 --> 1075.44
risking it he likes his technique

1072.679 --> 1078.74
technology he likes the easy part anyway

1075.44 --> 1084.8600000000001
that's yeah we know that's okay but

1078.74 --> 1089.99
stuff yeah this struggle concerning 5g

1084.86 --> 1092.149
is real it is happening and yeah if you

1089.99 --> 1095.57
don't like it if you want to keep your

1092.149 --> 1102.11
things then you know do that but don't

1095.57 --> 1105.4399999999998
get in the way that's it but he gets it

1102.11 --> 1112.1789999999999
I think and anger management issues oh

1105.44 --> 1115.6390000000001
yeah that's that's the thing you know

1112.179 --> 1118.45
did this is I don't know if anybody's

1115.639 --> 1122.779
figured that out or heard it before but

1118.45 --> 1125.24
increased radiation and stuff from cell

1122.779 --> 1128.419
phone systems and Wi-Fi what it

1125.24 --> 1131.84
typically does it add it eights and with

1128.419 --> 1134.2990000000002
some people they become really numb like

1131.84 --> 1136.879
really numb like zombies if it gets

1134.299 --> 1139.279
really bad that's like the direction it

1136.879 --> 1144.549
goes towards and some people get really

1139.279 --> 1150.649
angry guess in which category I fall

1144.549 --> 1154.369
mm-hmm so yeah you'll figure it out one

1150.649 --> 1156.4089999999999
way or the other it has an influence it

1154.369 --> 1161.259
has an influence and you and it stacks

1156.409 --> 1164.45
it stacks over time and there is no way

1161.259 --> 1168.35
like the idea that you will not notice

1164.45 --> 1170.8990000000001
it that's a lie you will there is no way

1168.35 --> 1174.83
to escape noticing what it does over

1170.899 --> 1177.7689999999998
time unless you literally throw

1174.83 --> 1180.08
everything out with with the garbage you

1177.769 --> 1182.179
like you don't care that it whatever

1180.08 --> 1183.9499999999998
it's gonna do you want to keep it anyway

1182.179 --> 1187.1000000000001
you know that's but that's the choice

1183.95 --> 1189.64
each individual has to make leaving with

1187.1 --> 1189.6399999999999
this technology

1200.14 --> 1208.73
yeah home based consoles and and I had

1204.409 --> 1211.13
look again people want their they don't

1208.73 --> 1213.98
want wires that look especially tech

1211.13 --> 1216.74
heads like people that have like eight

1213.98 --> 1219.679
computers and ten servers they're out

1216.74 --> 1223.85
there like that are really techno heads

1219.679 --> 1228.23
you know yeah I guys I don't want to

1223.85 --> 1231.4399999999998
take away your ability not to end up

1228.23 --> 1233.779
starve starving to death choked in giant

1231.44 --> 1238.46
amounts of wires okay I don't want to

1233.779 --> 1242.86
take away your maneuvering freedom so I

1238.46 --> 1246.529
I don't want to forbid that technology

1242.86 --> 1249.289
it's just that it's gotta be kept under

1246.529 --> 1251.809
control you have to know what it does

1249.289 --> 1254.0
you have to make that choice but make

1251.809 --> 1255.47
sure that it's not gonna damage other so

1254.0 --> 1258.679
if you're gonna do it in a certain area

1255.47 --> 1263.48
that make sure it's isolated then it's

1258.679 --> 1265.72
not gonna damage things people in the

1263.48 --> 1268.76
surrounding area know this stuff and

1265.72 --> 1270.8890000000001
then ya do with it whatever you want you

1268.76 --> 1273.08
know it's probably if you even kind of

1270.889 --> 1275.1789999999999
Faraday cage it with local transmitters

1273.08 --> 1277.6689999999999
you you could even lessen the energy

1275.179 --> 1280.519
output because the whole room would

1277.669 --> 1281.5700000000002
start to reflect it so the signal would

1280.519 --> 1285.529
be even more vivid

1281.57 --> 1289.97
I think I'm not an electronics expert

1285.529 --> 1293.299
but you know so that's my personal

1289.97 --> 1297.019
solution don't take it don't take the

1293.299 --> 1301.039
things away but just encapsulate it make

1297.019 --> 1303.59
it safe and don't let it be forced on

1301.039 --> 1306.049
the whole world on the public against

1303.59 --> 1307.73
their will just because a bunch of snobs

1306.049 --> 1308.58
want to have a little bit faster

1307.73 --> 1330.24
internet under for

1308.58 --> 1332.01
mobiles right okay let's get to some

1330.24 --> 1335.46
flat earth I see there's somebody in

1332.01 --> 1336.0
chat eager to hear out more flat that's

1335.46 --> 1339.059
okay

1336.0 --> 1340.679
Oh Missouri Bear I see the chat is quite

1339.059 --> 1344.639
active now by the way for the one

1340.679 --> 1352.44
watching nice that's a Saturday

1344.639 --> 1356.029
hmm almost forgot why is there a

1352.44 --> 1361.2
pressure gradient in the atmosphere is

1356.029 --> 1368.059
we are in a enclosed dome are we okay

1361.2 --> 1371.909
that's not a I should that's not a

1368.059 --> 1374.07
logical syntax error that just doesn't

1371.909 --> 1376.8200000000002
make any sense sorry you have to

1374.07 --> 1376.82
rephrase that question

1380.33 --> 1386.27
hey Adam making the studio 68

1410.58 --> 1415.9189999999999
I didn't even see what he was saying but

1414.59 --> 1424.83
yeah

1415.919 --> 1426.47
oh okay new to English hmm that's a

1424.83 --> 1433.559
tough one in Germany isn't it

1426.47 --> 1437.64
especially they've always had like the

1433.559 --> 1438.9289999999999
German spoken versions of everything so

1437.64 --> 1444.539
that way you don't learn a lot of

1438.929 --> 1447.3890000000001
English so I know what you mean but yeah

1444.539 --> 1448.59
concerning a pressure gradient and a

1447.389 --> 1453.12
dough

1448.59 --> 1458.22
well the dome he was being an idiot

1453.12 --> 1463.2199999999998
okay good servant the dome is a concept

1458.22 --> 1468.75
that kind of Jim gives a geometrical

1463.22 --> 1471.24
fill in to a pure concept and that is

1468.75 --> 1473.49
the container a contained space a

1471.24 --> 1477.779
confined a limited amount of space that

1473.49 --> 1479.94
is and yeah that idea has been filled in

1477.779 --> 1482.37
with the dome that kind of unfortunately

1479.94 --> 1485.19
brings a very strong presupposition of a

1482.37 --> 1490.549
disk Flat Earth with it for which there

1485.19 --> 1494.76
is no actual proof at the orientation of

1490.549 --> 1498.809
the confines of the realm is disc shaped

1494.76 --> 1501.6299999999999
like that but the dome idea has come

1498.809 --> 1502.47
forth from that but yeah a container has

1501.63 --> 1503.94
to be there

1502.47 --> 1509.429
it has to be a limited amount of space

1503.94 --> 1514.74
and the gradient yet the gradient is

1509.429 --> 1519.269
just this weird side effect of yeah how

1514.74 --> 1523.799
things work in the realm and you could

1519.269 --> 1525.659
say it's a result that comes with

1523.799 --> 1528.09
gravity and now when I talk about

1525.659 --> 1530.3990000000001
gravity I'm talking about gravity the

1528.09 --> 1533.789
effect that is caused by relative

1530.399 --> 1538.9089999999999
density in other words the axis the

1533.789 --> 1542.1299999999999
alignment not the the non hypothesized

1538.909 --> 1543.8400000000001
Newtonian gravity and definitely not the

1542.13 --> 1547.5900000000001
bending of space-time

1543.84 --> 1551.97
set from Einstein talking just about the

1547.59 --> 1555.36
old-fashioned G extract from relative

1551.97 --> 1557.4
density the effect the alignment and

1555.36 --> 1559.1999999999998
yeah there is a gradient definitely

1557.4 --> 1560.94
there's a difference in pressure and it

1559.2 --> 1566.13
has to do with relative density and how

1560.94 --> 1569.159
things divide and yeah other than that

1566.13 --> 1572.8500000000001
it is like that there's no real

1569.159 --> 1578.22
explanation because we can't really vary

1572.85 --> 1581.4599999999998
and manipulate the whatever derives

1578.22 --> 1583.83
relative density this equilibrium to

1581.46 --> 1585.72
spawn the force the force of

1583.83 --> 1590.07
displacement due to the relative density

1585.72 --> 1595.409
relation we can vary that effect only

1590.07 --> 1599.01
through motion through yeah the diving

1595.409 --> 1601.6200000000001
plane can you sort of neutralize the

1599.01 --> 1605.25
relative density effect so things no

1601.62 --> 1608.1
longer displace in a relative density

1605.25 --> 1610.909
like fashion and then they call that

1608.1 --> 1614.279
zero gee that's very ironic because

1610.909 --> 1618.179
technically you could say zero little G

1614.279 --> 1620.809
it the effect has been neutralized it's

1618.179 --> 1625.25
funny how that technically still works

1620.809 --> 1629.039
yet they can also put the dream of

1625.25 --> 1631.919
gravity and outer space zero-g over that

1629.039 --> 1640.32
at the same time it's a double-layered

1631.919 --> 1644.24
it's very smart what's falling to the

1640.32 --> 1649.789
ground things that are heavier that are

1644.24 --> 1649.789
denser than the medium it is in

1659.49 --> 1669.76
well good servant it seems so the the

1666.37 --> 1675.07
gas how it comes into being how it is

1669.76 --> 1680.8799999999999
transformed that is very dynamic but

1675.07 --> 1680.8799999999999
even the dynamic system in itself look

1680.91 --> 1687.3700000000001
it's it's kind of complicated if you

1683.71 --> 1690.22
just take the model take all the all the

1687.37 --> 1691.6299999999999
complex elements away of how gas is

1690.22 --> 1693.07
supposed to be moving around and I'll

1691.63 --> 1695.17
just take it all the way and just go

1693.07 --> 1699.1
with okay it's made at the bottom up

1695.17 --> 1701.8300000000002
right not no turbulence no daily nights

1699.1 --> 1705.33
he changed it's just made at the bottom

1701.83 --> 1708.309
up right probably because of heat well

1705.33 --> 1711.9399999999998
it's not like it's constantly pushing

1708.309 --> 1716.44
upwards because then there would be

1711.94 --> 1719.6200000000001
constant upwards wind torus and I only

1716.44 --> 1723.55
think that happens during heat because

1719.62 --> 1725.9499999999998
hot air expands so in the daylight when

1723.55 --> 1728.35
the heat is exchanged during the day

1725.95 --> 1731.5800000000002
with the ground then that heats up the

1728.35 --> 1735.34
air and that kind of pushes it all up

1731.58 --> 1739.78
but it's not like it's really moving up

1735.34 --> 1743.7099999999998
it's more like it's expanding and yet

1739.78 --> 1746.53
these things it is super complex like it

1743.71 --> 1749.98
does not by itself explain the gradient

1746.53 --> 1754.84
is not explained by gases being made

1749.98 --> 1757.69
from the bottom up although the gradient

1754.84 --> 1761.29
would probably lessen if if that stopped

1757.69 --> 1764.74
if there was no like yeah if it was

1761.29 --> 1767.59
caught off from being able to interact

1764.74 --> 1770.17
with the material that there could no

1767.59 --> 1771.309
longer be any gases coming from the

1770.17 --> 1773.53
ground up then the gradient would

1771.309 --> 1776.69
probably also alter because of it the

1773.53 --> 1779.8999999999999
whole dynamics of course but

1776.69 --> 1782.54
it the gas is being created at bottom-up

1779.9 --> 1785.0
does not directly explain the gradient

1782.54 --> 1789.71
the gradient in itself is really the

1785.0 --> 1792.14
effect caused by relative density which

1789.71 --> 1793.57
is known as little G gravity the

1792.14 --> 1797.24
alignment

1793.57 --> 1800.27
it's just how it divides and what causes

1797.24 --> 1803.6
that is a is a big mystery because

1800.27 --> 1806.42
there's no way to really vary and

1803.6 --> 1808.58
manipulate gravity if you want to call

1806.42 --> 1811.91
it that but at the same time there's no

1808.58 --> 1817.4299999999998
been a way to very manipulate the yeah

1811.91 --> 1819.8200000000002
the effect of relative density in a

1817.43 --> 1822.8
sense that the force displacement due to

1819.82 --> 1826.3999999999999
the change with the medium that effect

1822.8 --> 1827.99
itself cannot be neutralized unless you

1826.4 --> 1831.0500000000002
take the whole thing in motion but then

1827.99 --> 1839.86
you kind of break the very concept of it

1831.05 --> 1842.4199999999998
also it gets really complicated right

1839.86 --> 1847.6999999999998
it's the fundamental mechanism that's

1842.42 --> 1851.8300000000002
right good serving it is the the thing

1847.7 --> 1855.44
that most reliably explains the natural

1851.83 --> 1857.83
displacement based on density versus its

1855.44 --> 1857.8300000000002
medium

1862.88 --> 1866.7890000000002
[Music]

1864.039 --> 1866.789
mmm

1881.37 --> 1888.809
so I hope I answered your questions to

1884.46 --> 1890.52
the fool yeah things get really

1888.809 --> 1894.1499999999999
complicated because I know all the

1890.52 --> 1895.68
issues I know also the ballers thrive in

1894.15 --> 1900.51
how freakin complex it is

1895.68 --> 1903.75
look I've shared this before the ball

1900.51 --> 1906.72
religion thrives on how complex things

1903.75 --> 1908.52
are and that they are hard to get for

1906.72 --> 1911.19
the public the general public were

1908.52 --> 1913.5
completely not in the know but even for

1911.19 --> 1916.2
themselves as they already master it

1913.5 --> 1918.45
further and then gave this virtual

1916.2 --> 1922.6200000000001
social weight over people that don't

1918.45 --> 1924.54
know it but they can also use the the

1922.62 --> 1927.05
preponderance did the overwhelming

1924.54 --> 1931.26
amount of data and still left unknowns

1927.05 --> 1935.7
to prevent themselves from figuring out

1931.26 --> 1938.51
the errors they just they just don't

1935.7 --> 1938.51
think about it

1940.63 --> 1945.5500000000002
they there's so much to distract with so

1943.72 --> 1948.04
much to red herring with there's so many

1945.55 --> 1949.96
details that leave open interesting

1948.04 --> 1953.11
questions so they then prefer to go to

1949.96 --> 1955.8700000000001
those presuppositional based details and

1953.11 --> 1957.01
just like oh what's the next step or

1955.87 --> 1959.1999999999998
what's the next piece of the puzzle

1957.01 --> 1962.92
instead of looking like right decided

1959.2 --> 1967.3
where this huge gap is literally just

1962.92 --> 1971.53
breaking the whole thing that's because

1967.3 --> 1973.33
of the giant amount of data that's

1971.53 --> 1975.97
available there's so much to play with

1973.33 --> 1980.1999999999998
you don't have to you can just put the

1975.97 --> 1981.8500000000001
the broken part about it aside and the

1980.2 --> 1986.13
realizations that come with it and then

1981.85 --> 1986.1299999999999
keep playing with the fun parts

2010.69 --> 2017.94
well I okay big my guess I don't know

2015.009 --> 2017.94
what a budgie is

2029.01 --> 2038.52
oh by the way I was listening to

2033.44 --> 2041.7
interview with mark sergeant mark the

2038.52 --> 2045.8
flattered sergeant over at his channel I

2041.7 --> 2049.85
did it was it yesterday night I think

2045.8 --> 2049.85
something before where was it

2052.55 --> 2059.429
all right

2053.97 --> 2061.919
yeah Flat Earth Clues interview 283 it

2059.429 --> 2065.61
was it was interesting again especially

2061.919 --> 2067.5899999999997
because yeah these were not flat

2065.61 --> 2071.07
earthers they were so basic they were

2067.59 --> 2075.4190000000003
pretty open-minded but very not Flat

2071.07 --> 2078.84
Earth informed people so it was just

2075.419 --> 2083.6389999999997
yeah mark getting tested in the typical

2078.84 --> 2086.429
mark sergeant way by I don't mean to be

2083.639 --> 2088.53
mean but kind of dumb people are just

2086.429 --> 2090.69
really non informed people and he just

2088.53 --> 2092.19
has the patience of a saint not saying

2090.69 --> 2093.84
these people were like really dumb or

2092.19 --> 2096.419
anything it's just that it's so typical

2093.84 --> 2098.4900000000002
it happens every time and you must be

2096.419 --> 2104.7599999999998
dealing with that [ __ ] like every single

2098.49 --> 2106.47
time he's yeah it must feel to him

2104.76 --> 2108.78
almost like he is a kindergarten

2106.47 --> 2111.18
teachers it and he has to just keep on

2108.78 --> 2113.4
explaining the super basic things over

2111.18 --> 2117.02
and with eternal patience and I think

2113.4 --> 2117.02
he's doing just a fantastic job

2122.0 --> 2125.0
okay

2131.23 --> 2138.94
right uh yeah that's a good question

2135.04 --> 2141.19
Cameron Parker what forces the Sun and

2138.94 --> 2146.59
Moon into positions and patterns we

2141.19 --> 2149.44
observe well forces when you're

2146.59 --> 2151.619
considering that you have you should

2149.44 --> 2154.33
first realize that you can take out any

2151.619 --> 2156.07
physical based forces out of the picture

2154.33 --> 2157.96
because there's no proof that any of

2156.07 --> 2161.0800000000004
those heavenly bodies are physical in

2157.96 --> 2166.75
nature in the first place as in objects

2161.08 --> 2168.369
in locations so any forces anything that

2166.75 --> 2170.92
would propel it

2168.369 --> 2174.1000000000004
what displace it would not require

2170.92 --> 2177.46
physical motion based force because

2174.1 --> 2179.77
there is nothing that requires force to

2177.46 --> 2180.369
displace in this case that's for

2179.77 --> 2183.16
starters

2180.369 --> 2185.109
so what is making them move the way they

2183.16 --> 2189.67
do it in this specific pattern I don't

2185.109 --> 2192.2799999999997
know exactly but it seems all that that

2189.67 --> 2198.13
is kind of based in oscillation in

2192.28 --> 2202.869
nature so it's probably it reminds me at

2198.13 --> 2206.07
least of the my Devas sound might have

2202.869 --> 2209.7400000000002
an influence in some way that I just

2206.07 --> 2211.51
feel because of the oscillation that

2209.74 --> 2216.54
it's like everything is circular like

2211.51 --> 2220.69
that in specific pattern and electrics

2216.54 --> 2224.02
you know the only way we can even create

2220.69 --> 2226.54
our own light besides fire that's just

2224.02 --> 2230.5
based on chemical reaction is through

2226.54 --> 2232.65
electricity and yeah electricity light

2230.5 --> 2236.5
has revealed all kinds of fascinating

2232.65 --> 2238.27
things concerning light and even allowed

2236.5 --> 2243.55
us to make things like Holograms and

2238.27 --> 2245.14
such with technology and so I think that

2243.55 --> 2247.0600000000004
yeah whatever they heavenly bought

2245.14 --> 2250.99
whatever drives the heavenly bodies

2247.06 --> 2254.07
whatever fuels the light it's it's very

2250.99 --> 2257.9799999999996
likely to be electrical in some way and

2254.07 --> 2260.17
why do does it do that in this circular

2257.98 --> 2262.42
pattern specifically why is it even

2260.17 --> 2262.96
freakin like in relation to the observer

2262.42 --> 2268.1800000000003
like the

2262.96 --> 2276.39
I don't know it's a part of the more

2268.18 --> 2276.39
complex design effects of this realm so

2279.54 --> 2286.089
yeah that there's some kind of

2282.069 --> 2288.7599999999998
oscillation happening and it's constant

2286.089 --> 2291.67
and yeah the only thing that I can think

2288.76 --> 2293.8900000000003
of that would actually feed that light

2291.67 --> 2296.38
would be electricity in some way where

2293.89 --> 2298.66
is that electricity coming from is it

2296.38 --> 2303.52
just a field that is ever present is it

2298.66 --> 2306.0099999999998
like a yeah I don't know man I don't

2303.52 --> 2309.13
even fully understand why there is

2306.01 --> 2311.6800000000003
energy here in the first place like from

2309.13 --> 2314.92
a technical perspective why there is all

2311.68 --> 2319.96
this electricity everywhere why does

2314.92 --> 2321.579
anybody ever ask that even you know we

2319.96 --> 2323.98
all talk about is there and look all the

2321.579 --> 2326.4
design yeah of course of course it has

2323.98 --> 2331.66
to be there or nothing would be here but

2326.4 --> 2336.4
how yeah it's kind of a dead end

2331.66 --> 2341.44
question but yeah I'm sure electricity

2336.4 --> 2344.319
is the main fuel in some way that that

2341.44 --> 2347.849
causes sunlight and moonlight and all of

2344.319 --> 2347.849
the heavenly bodies in some way

2365.12 --> 2368.02
oh okay

2368.15 --> 2372.34
I didn't know that Big Mike s

2376.82 --> 2386.8700000000003
uh Cameron Parker I don't know there

2382.16 --> 2389.0499999999997
might be something to it it might be

2386.87 --> 2392.0
true in some way that if you go down

2389.05 --> 2396.53
that for some reason heat starts

2392.0 --> 2399.05
radiating off down and how is that

2396.53 --> 2402.38
possible I don't know you know maybe

2399.05 --> 2405.04
there maybe the freaking earth is in

2402.38 --> 2406.94
between like a hot and a cold plate

2405.04 --> 2409.97
maybe that is it

2406.94 --> 2411.65
maybe that's the the polarized situation

2409.97 --> 2415.3999999999996
there's a hot plate there's a cold plate

2411.65 --> 2419.78
on the hot plate is the earth is giant

2415.4 --> 2423.29
amounts of stone and everything and it

2419.78 --> 2427.1000000000004
yeah gifts passes on this heat just like

2423.29 --> 2430.34
he does absorb from the Sun in in rocks

2427.1 --> 2433.52
and then at night it advanced off that

2430.34 --> 2435.53
heat it gives it off to the cold air so

2433.52 --> 2439.19
maybe that is it maybe there's a hot

2435.53 --> 2447.0800000000004
plate below and there's a cold plate

2439.19 --> 2449.27
above plate plate thing feel field I

2447.08 --> 2451.79
don't know you know it could all be

2449.27 --> 2456.32
fields could just be like okay there is

2451.79 --> 2459.2
a just a almost like a microwave like

2456.32 --> 2460.9700000000003
effect and just get stronger the closer

2459.2 --> 2463.72
you get there and just everything just

2460.97 --> 2465.95
heats up electrically or cools down

2463.72 --> 2468.31
electrically however that can't work I

2465.95 --> 2468.31
don't know

2476.98 --> 2482.349
right but it is an interesting question

2479.23 --> 2483.16
you know like does it get warmer when

2482.349 --> 2487.4500000000003
you go down

2483.16 --> 2491.3799999999997
is that universal it could be you know

2487.45 --> 2495.22
there it's I think it is generally known

2491.38 --> 2498.01
as just geothermic heat you know what

2495.22 --> 2503.6499999999996
exactly causes this geothermic heat is

2498.01 --> 2511.3900000000003
it the presence of lava somewhere or is

2503.65 --> 2514.109
it just eat electrically there yeah I

2511.39 --> 2514.109
don't know

2519.46 --> 2525.19
I've never really been that deep it

2521.75 --> 2525.19
makes me kind of feel uncomfortable

2526.65 --> 2531.9900000000002
I like ice I like high places more than

2530.13 --> 2534.33
I like low places although I do have

2531.99 --> 2540.6299999999997
some fear of heights so I don't like it

2534.33 --> 2543.02
too much but I like being here on a

2540.63 --> 2543.02
floor

2560.099 --> 2563.2090000000003
hey ISA

2568.95 --> 2572.93
lots of people in here

2617.03 --> 2628.8
right so anymore anymore Oh God

2626.64 --> 2631.5299999999997
yeah I might have a little movie review

2628.8 --> 2635.34
of thingy yeah I forgot about it

2631.53 --> 2639.7200000000003
yesterday but day before I've watched

2635.34 --> 2643.5
the latest Star Wars movie if you can

2639.72 --> 2650.64
even really call it a movie I thought it

2643.5 --> 2655.38
was more like a cartoon that was made

2650.64 --> 2658.7999999999997
into a live-action film that like

2655.38 --> 2660.6600000000003
especially the first part it was so

2658.8 --> 2662.82
rushed it was literally like I was

2660.66 --> 2665.81
looking at a comic book did anybody else

2662.82 --> 2668.31
had that experience with that movie it

2665.81 --> 2672.48
none of it made sense

2668.31 --> 2674.82
it was so sloppy just but some great

2672.48 --> 2676.47
visuals though but it was just like a

2674.82 --> 2678.03
bunch of paintings because when you

2676.47 --> 2680.5499999999997
really thought about what was going on

2678.03 --> 2684.8100000000004
none of it made any freaking sense was

2680.55 --> 2687.6800000000003
all really cool and all that what so not

2684.81 --> 2687.68
carefully thought through

2693.14 --> 2705.5
yeah so as a ride as a sci-fi ride there

2702.86 --> 2707.3
were like a phase space fantasy I

2705.5 --> 2709.28
wouldn't even call it sci-fi at this

2707.3 --> 2712.55
point it's more space fantasy a space

2709.28 --> 2716.57
fantasy ride like a roller coaster yeah

2712.55 --> 2719.8900000000003
it was freaking epic officials and even

2716.57 --> 2722.3300000000004
sounds and and there were even some

2719.89 --> 2725.83
interesting kind of new concept but it

2722.33 --> 2729.41
was also unbelievably rushed through

2725.83 --> 2732.92
it's just lost its just lost pearls

2729.41 --> 2734.2999999999997
before swine's it was lost it's too bad

2732.92 --> 2737.06
because there were some interesting

2734.3 --> 2739.25
things in there very interesting but

2737.06 --> 2743.7799999999997
just just so rushed because when you

2739.25 --> 2749.81
look at the story oh my god they did not

2743.78 --> 2753.32
get rid of the stupid social new way of

2749.81 --> 2754.88
going about influence at all that was so

2753.32 --> 2756.6200000000003
terrible in the last two movies

2754.88 --> 2759.11
especially the last one was just

2756.62 --> 2765.14
horrific they didn't get rid of it they

2759.11 --> 2768.4100000000003
kept it going and then they it seems

2765.14 --> 2771.4
like they couldn't get rid of that yet

2768.41 --> 2775.64
they didn't really know what to do

2771.4 --> 2777.71
again worse than before and therefore it

2775.64 --> 2780.2599999999998
seems like they just didn't do anything

2777.71 --> 2787.18
really they just rushed things and just

2780.26 --> 2787.1800000000003
like is that that it I don't know such

2788.29 --> 2795.0099999999998
I can't imagine that there's like a

2790.9 --> 2799.1800000000003
whole swath of people just like screw

2795.01 --> 2801.3700000000003
that and and I've always also been

2799.18 --> 2804.22
thinking there has been some amazing

2801.37 --> 2807.6099999999997
visual scenes in there as well you could

2804.22 --> 2811.6299999999997
literally do with this movie what was

2807.61 --> 2814.51
done with the with Star Wars 1 The

2811.63 --> 2816.4900000000002
Phantom Menace and make a phantom at it

2814.51 --> 2819.82
out it would be a very short problem he

2816.49 --> 2821.5899999999997
would not even admit maybe a quarter to

2819.82 --> 2823.6600000000003
half of the movie and the rest just all

2821.59 --> 2825.55
of it cut out especially all the talking

2823.66 --> 2829.6
especially the other stupid characters

2825.55 --> 2830.0800000000004
to just completely superfluous and most

2829.6 --> 2832.27
of it

2830.08 --> 2837.2799999999997
keep get it out most of it and it would

2832.27 --> 2840.82
be more like an art like movie with just

2837.28 --> 2845.1400000000003
music silence visuals the nostalgia

2840.82 --> 2847.51
there was so many nostalgic scenes where

2845.14 --> 2850.72
they would show old sets and and that

2847.51 --> 2855.6400000000003
was really awesome that part so just cut

2850.72 --> 2858.16
out all the shitty movie make the the

2855.64 --> 2861.1299999999997
return of the Skywalker editors the edit

2858.16 --> 2863.31
of the Skywalker and you could have like

2861.13 --> 2866.11
a relatively short movie that would be

2863.31 --> 2870.67
absolutely incredible as a standalone

2866.11 --> 2872.32
thing but I don't know maybe there's

2870.67 --> 2874.36
some people onto that or maybe they've

2872.32 --> 2876.52
just said not screw all of it we don't

2874.36 --> 2877.3
want to have anything to do with Star

2876.52 --> 2883.5099999999998
Wars anymore

2877.3 --> 2888.88
I don't know I out you know when they

2883.51 --> 2891.9700000000003
derailed so much oh like it's not a

2888.88 --> 2893.6800000000003
natural continuation of this just

2891.97 --> 2897.91
doesn't house things socially where it's

2893.68 --> 2899.56
just not yeah yeah they broke the spell

2897.91 --> 2900.33
they broke their own spell they polluted

2899.56 --> 2903.14
it

2900.33 --> 2903.14
too bad

2909.14 --> 2913.18
anyway yet so I saw that movie

2921.809 --> 2932.17
yeah and expect dak Euler visuals and

2927.029 --> 2937.719
absurdly rushed story absurdly rushed

2932.17 --> 2941.739
story really it's like it's so absurdly

2937.719 --> 2944.67
rushed it would make the 80s the typical

2941.739 --> 2949.529
80s experimental things look like

2944.67 --> 2949.529
conservative in comparison

2959.33 --> 2964.34
[Music]

2972.28 --> 2979.77
Donnie Yen who is that sir I don't know

2976.45 --> 2988.41
any the actors especially the newer act

2979.77 --> 2992.849
no idea who that is let me see all right

2988.41 --> 2992.8489999999997
yeah sure

2999.44 --> 3004.11
[Music]

3007.07 --> 3012.42
you know what I kind of missed in the

3009.48 --> 3014.19
movie what I really missed because yeah

3012.42 --> 3016.17
okay it's not gonna be a spoiler to

3014.19 --> 3018.21
anyone because they put it all over the

3016.17 --> 3021.51
trailer and all that the emperor

3018.21 --> 3025.34
palpatine he's back someway somehow well

3021.51 --> 3025.34
what I really missed in the movie is

3027.41 --> 3034.08
they probably skipped it doing that cuz

3031.41 --> 3036.5099999999998
it would I don't know what but I just

3034.08 --> 3041.869
thought about okay if he actually in

3036.51 --> 3045.3900000000003
some way survived then they should have

3041.869 --> 3048.06
like done a con just like what they did

3045.39 --> 3050.46
okay this may be my thing in the Lord of

3048.06 --> 3052.849
the Rings in the the second one remember

3050.46 --> 3055.7400000000002
the first one Gandalf

3052.849 --> 3058.44
fights off the Bell Rock and then the

3055.74 --> 3060.81
Bell Rock drags him with his whip at the

3058.44 --> 3062.31
last second into the pits and he falls

3060.81 --> 3065.0099999999998
and everybody thinks he's dead right

3062.31 --> 3067.41
well they should have in my personal

3065.01 --> 3070.17
opinion done the same thing with the

3067.41 --> 3072.27
Emperor as he fell down the fiery shaft

3070.17 --> 3077.16
remember and it's like okay he's falling

3072.27 --> 3079.56
straight into the reactor well what if

3077.16 --> 3082.589
they actually took that shot and then

3079.56 --> 3085.47
saw him falling down and he actually I

3082.589 --> 3089.609
don't know partially burned but he

3085.47 --> 3092.1899999999996
managed to yeah make himself fall

3089.609 --> 3094.71
through to an exit or something and got

3092.19 --> 3096.54
out and even got out of the explode it

3094.71 --> 3099.33
would have been kind of interesting to

3096.54 --> 3103.47
show something like that you know

3099.33 --> 3106.619
because as he was thrown down the pit by

3103.47 --> 3110.0989999999997
Darth Vader he was pretty much fully

3106.619 --> 3114.0
intact he wasn't even really wounded by

3110.099 --> 3115.4300000000003
anyone you know he wasn't struck he

3114.0 --> 3118.619
didn't even have to put him it just

3115.43 --> 3122.1299999999997
blasted a lot with his electricity like

3118.619 --> 3124.02
an old man but technically he wasn't

3122.13 --> 3126.839
even wounded so being thrown down that

3124.02 --> 3128.82
shaft that wouldn't mean that he would

3126.839 --> 3134.6
be absolutely doomed it's even compare

3128.82 --> 3137.77
it to Star Wars five

3134.6 --> 3141.2
in the cloud city where a Luke Skywalker

3137.77 --> 3143.54
yeah yet has his his confrontation with

3141.2 --> 3146.12
Darth Vader and then he falls down

3143.54 --> 3150.71
remember and then it's like oh he's dead

3146.12 --> 3154.37
no no he just he hangs around it's not

3150.71 --> 3156.44
over so why could Emperor Palpatine not

3154.37 --> 3163.67
have such a moment why didn't they give

3156.44 --> 3166.84
it to him you know I said said too much

3163.67 --> 3170.06
to ask her if they want to do all that

3166.84 --> 3172.78
mega ultimate enemy think to him why

3170.06 --> 3177.44
didn't they give him that why not I

3172.78 --> 3181.7000000000003
don't get it I could have been one seen

3177.44 --> 3189.38
like maybe two to five minutes that's it

3181.7 --> 3192.41
why didn't they do that or make him tell

3189.38 --> 3194.81
them how it happened like in the final

3192.41 --> 3197.18
scene as it were that before the [ __ ]

3194.81 --> 3200.06
breaks loose he would tell them yeah I

3197.18 --> 3203.06
this and this happened I fell and then

3200.06 --> 3205.19
show it as he's telling like how he fell

3203.06 --> 3208.84
and how he then escaped why didn't they

3205.19 --> 3218.39
do it damn it

3208.84 --> 3221.33
such a wasted opportunity but anyway

3218.39 --> 3223.8799999999997
yeah this it's like a side side note on

3221.33 --> 3228.4
something that's just so torn out of

3223.88 --> 3228.4
whack and all that what they did

3240.069 --> 3246.609
you know if technically I think it

3244.39 --> 3249.5989999999997
wouldn't even be too difficult to just

3246.609 --> 3253.15
make a scene like that from by a fan

3249.599 --> 3257.559
just a short scene using mostly CGI and

3253.15 --> 3260.949
the old footages and yeah somebody could

3257.559 --> 3263.289
literally doesn't even have to be the

3260.949 --> 3263.849
Star Wars studio it would be better of

3263.289 --> 3266.289
course

3263.849 --> 3272.4100000000003
although yeah if they don't overdo it

3266.289 --> 3274.869
because they might I don't know yeah

3272.41 --> 3279.759
it's just that I really appreciate the

3274.869 --> 3282.6600000000003
old Star Wars how they did it oh and by

3279.759 --> 3286.93
the way talking about old [ __ ] old stuff

3282.66 --> 3290.229
this is it's odd but for like the first

3286.93 --> 3293.589
time ever I I'm starting to watch the

3290.229 --> 3296.41
old Star Trek I've never watched it

3293.589 --> 3298.3289999999997
before ever that's weird like I always

3296.41 --> 3300.3999999999996
avoided it maybe it's because of the

3298.329 --> 3301.809
people that told me to go and watch it

3300.4 --> 3310.539
and then I saw those people and I were

3301.809 --> 3313.6600000000003
like no no no no but looking at as is a

3310.539 --> 3317.3390000000004
very old old series it's kind of

3313.66 --> 3322.5989999999997
fascinating it was really like a studio

3317.339 --> 3325.749
thing and they were putting in real

3322.599 --> 3328.779
sci-fi ideas that at that time were kind

3325.749 --> 3332.4399999999996
of like really fresh and bring energy

3328.779 --> 3334.359
and and some people also like didn't

3332.44 --> 3337.959
really believe in it all that much even

3334.359 --> 3340.18
it was no it's just fascinating it's

3337.959 --> 3342.8489999999997
such a different era so I'm enjoying

3340.18 --> 3345.0989999999997
watching that gradually because it is

3342.849 --> 3347.829
kind of old and slow and but there's

3345.099 --> 3350.589
still some pretty condensed sci-fi

3347.829 --> 3352.63
things in there already like even in the

3350.589 --> 3357.88
very first episode that didn't even have

3352.63 --> 3362.309
Captain Kirk in it it was pretty intense

3357.88 --> 3362.309
that first episode like really

3362.83 --> 3367.22
sorry for begetting distracted over

3365.45 --> 3370.0899999999997
movies I'll check out what you guys are

3367.22 --> 3370.0899999999997
talking about again

3379.069 --> 3387.659
well Cameron Parkin why does light drift

3384.089 --> 3389.669
15 degrees per hour because that is what

3387.659 --> 3393.329
that is right you realize that a ring

3389.669 --> 3395.069
laser gyroscope is literally light the

3393.329 --> 3398.549
light there's no fit it's not a physical

3395.069 --> 3402.179
gyroscope there's no physical motion

3398.549 --> 3405.059
which would be required if the earth

3402.179 --> 3406.9790000000003
were a ball and spinning physical

3405.059 --> 3408.929
consequences with gyroscopes whether the

3406.979 --> 3411.1789999999996
physical gyroscope didn't drift it was

3408.929 --> 3415.409
only in the ring laser gyroscope so yeah

3411.179 --> 3419.929
one can conclude okay light drifts 15

3415.409 --> 3419.929
degrees an hour that's very interesting

3424.51 --> 3432.94
right yeah then W then Winfield yes

3427.869 --> 3436.54
exactly he's like in the brain overlords

3432.94 --> 3440.05
ooh but the funny thing was is that it

3436.54 --> 3441.94
was surprisingly detailed and worked out

3440.05 --> 3444.52
like it was really well thought about

3441.94 --> 3448.3
they really thought about the the

3444.52 --> 3451.78
opponents that there was a lot of time

3448.3 --> 3454.0600000000004
spent on the story of that first episode

3451.78 --> 3457.27
it really surprised me when I saw it

3454.06 --> 3459.64
really surprised me and it doesn't

3457.27 --> 3462.94
surprise me that it was embraced as such

3459.64 --> 3467.44
a success because the first episode is

3462.94 --> 3478.3
really amazing it wasn't it was better

3467.44 --> 3484.27
than I thought it was anyway crap excuse

3478.3 --> 3485.1400000000003
for what ring laser gyro drifts 15

3484.27 --> 3487.24
degrees per hour

3485.14 --> 3489.0099999999998
I guess there's another thing out there

3487.24 --> 3495.6699999999996
that does that you know the heavenly

3489.01 --> 3500.19
bodies the thumb it also drifts in in

3495.67 --> 3500.19
angle wise right so that's interesting

3501.39 --> 3506.68
doesn't have any consequences for

3504.22 --> 3509.1699999999996
anything physical though you know light

3506.68 --> 3513.48
drifting is an interesting thing it has

3509.17 --> 3517.39
no consequences for any physical body

3513.48 --> 3520.23
spinning in space because if that were

3517.39 --> 3524.68
the case then physical gyroscopes would

3520.23 --> 3526.93
definitely have to stand in place as the

3524.68 --> 3534.5499999999997
earth would be turning underneath it yet

3526.93 --> 3538.02
they don't they never did all right you

3534.55 --> 3540.82
get it's kind of a modus tollens

3538.02 --> 3548.05
situation I guess so if the earth would

3540.82 --> 3549.88
be spinning Q then all that was the

3548.05 --> 3553.96
physical consequence that a physical

3549.88 --> 3556.51
gyroscope would have - yeah would stand

3553.96 --> 3563.92
still not be motion because that is what

3556.51 --> 3565.9900000000002
gyroscopes do right yet they don't so

3563.92 --> 3570.34
the earth is definitely not a ball

3565.99 --> 3573.04
spinning and yeah there can be an

3570.34 --> 3576.04
exception look just because a ring laser

3573.04 --> 3578.32
gyro scuffs has some drift that doesn't

3576.04 --> 3583.57
mean anything if the other regular

3578.32 --> 3585.79
gyroscope does not see it still it still

3583.57 --> 3588.25
doesn't spin because the regular

3585.79 --> 3591.75
gyroscope doesn't displace it's just the

3588.25 --> 3596.08
light thing so doesn't mean anything

3591.75 --> 3601.51
doesn't mean anything as to the earth

3596.08 --> 3603.869
being a physical spinning ball doesn't

3601.51 --> 3603.869
prove it

3616.59 --> 3630.1800000000003
what no mark colored pendulum now the

3625.62 --> 3632.75
the focal pendulum does not prove the

3630.18 --> 3639.5699999999997
Earth spins the focal pendulum is a

3632.75 --> 3642.15
magic trick to make you imagine that the

3639.57 --> 3646.31
Earth spins underneath these separately

3642.15 --> 3650.73
moving pendulum it's a pure mind

3646.31 --> 3654.6
experiment it doesn't prove anything it

3650.73 --> 3657.33
makes you imagine how it does that just

3654.6 --> 3660.2999999999997
like how they try to make you imagine

3657.33 --> 3663.6
that the horizon is the leading edge of

3660.3 --> 3665.9100000000003
a sphere which it isn't it's not a

3663.6 --> 3670.5299999999997
geometrical sphere it's not the

3665.91 --> 3673.7
geometrical horizon because of the black

3670.53 --> 3673.7000000000003
swan we can see too far

3680.08 --> 3684.3199999999997
I've never heard of that mark college

3682.55 --> 3688.04
I'm not gonna go with that at all I

3684.32 --> 3690.44
don't even think that no or unless

3688.04 --> 3693.74
they've updated that ridiculous thing to

3690.44 --> 3695.96
do that now but the original Foucault's

3693.74 --> 3701.12
Pendulum did not have electronics in it

3695.96 --> 3702.77
it was just to make you imagine how the

3701.12 --> 3705.5299999999997
earth was spinning beneath it that was

3702.77 --> 3707.03
the only thing it did it's a pure mind

3705.53 --> 3717.5
trick I don't know about this

3707.03 --> 3721.5400000000004
electronics know the pendulum is not

3717.5 --> 3721.54
electronic what are you talking about

3725.96 --> 3734.28
motorized kick what are you talking

3730.17 --> 3735.11
about no it's just mechanical look it up

3734.28 --> 3740.9700000000003
again

3735.11 --> 3743.69
well that's ridiculous if if that's the

3740.97 --> 3747.66
case that is new then it's something new

3743.69 --> 3750.57
wasn't electronic there weren't even

3747.66 --> 3753.44
electronics around in that night it's

3750.57 --> 3753.44
just a trick

3753.74 --> 3763.6499999999996
it doesn't even do anything it only

3759.17 --> 3765.03
makes you imagine that the earth is

3763.65 --> 3768.81
spinning underneath it that is the only

3765.03 --> 3771.9
thing it does what what electron why why

3768.81 --> 3772.56
does it even matter it doesn't prove

3771.9 --> 3776.36
anything

3772.56 --> 3776.36
why does it matter

3785.41 --> 3791.479
now that this sounds like a controlled

3788.599 --> 3794.4500000000003
opposition conspiracies Theory nonsense

3791.479 --> 3795.589
that the muddy the waters that's exactly

3794.45 --> 3798.68
what this sounds like

3795.589 --> 3802.16
it's a ridiculous claim that's being

3798.68 --> 3804.6189999999997
forwarded to the to make the Savannah a

3802.16 --> 3807.339
chute there are in their own foot it's

3804.619 --> 3807.339
ridiculous

3810.309 --> 3816.2290000000003
you can series beliefs when somebody

3813.049 --> 3821.39
tells you there's electronics in that it

3816.229 --> 3823.9399999999996
doesn't do anything like even if there

3821.39 --> 3826.0389999999998
was electronics in there supposedly

3823.94 --> 3828.709
doing something giving some kind of push

3826.039 --> 3829.579
or whatever it still doesn't prove

3828.709 --> 3833.839
anything

3829.579 --> 3835.069
it never did it's just there to make you

3833.839 --> 3837.019
imagine you're at the spinning

3835.069 --> 3838.489
underneath it that is the only thing it

3837.019 --> 3840.799
is for it doesn't matter whatever

3838.489 --> 3843.489
gadgets they put in there are on top of

3840.799 --> 3843.489
it it doesn't matter

3871.18 --> 3880.0
to ensure they show the suppose that if

3875.31 --> 3890.62
you must be joking right you're right

3880.0 --> 3901.45
you're having a joke right to show this

3890.62 --> 3904.72
oppose the rotation it's just so but why

3901.45 --> 3906.97
would you bring it up then you were

3904.72 --> 3910.89
saying it like it was supposed to prove

3906.97 --> 3913.24
something no it never was

3910.89 --> 3915.52
doesn't matter if somebody's going to be

3913.24 --> 3918.0899999999997
pushing that thing constantly or if it's

3915.52 --> 3922.06
going to be like

3918.09 --> 3925.7200000000003
made constant by a little pushes from

3922.06 --> 3929.49
mode it doesn't matter it it never

3925.72 --> 3929.49
proved anything in the first place

3950.12 --> 3953.23
[Music]

3962.809 --> 3968.989
No yeah but that's no they don't need

3965.719 --> 3973.489
power to make it do what they say it

3968.989 --> 3975.709
does that has nothing to do with it

3973.489 --> 3979.5190000000002
they don't need power they'd only thrust

3975.709 --> 3982.1299999999997
they just need it to move it could just

3979.519 --> 3985.5789999999997
be initiated by somebody whatever

3982.13 --> 3987.259
automated it's just about it moving it

3985.579 --> 3989.869
doesn't even matter how it moves and

3987.259 --> 3992.179
then somebody pointing at it and telling

3989.869 --> 3993.829
you look the earth is spinning

3992.179 --> 3999.109
underneath it that's all it is

3993.829 --> 4002.469
doesn't matter what it does really all

3999.109 --> 4004.299
it really is is just a Oh a hypnotizing

4002.469 --> 4006.309
trick really it's just a giant pendulum

4004.299 --> 4007.839
I call the earth is spinning underneath

4006.309 --> 4010.7490000000003
the earth is spinning underneath you

4007.839 --> 4012.249
know what I mean I don't have yeah the

4010.749 --> 4013.959
earth is spinning underneath the earth

4012.249 --> 4017.89
is spinning underneath that's it that's

4013.959 --> 4019.4489999999996
practically what it is it's kind of

4017.89 --> 4021.069
funny now that I think about it it

4019.449 --> 4023.909
really is just an old-fashioned

4021.069 --> 4023.909
hypnotized trick

4050.88 --> 4056.82
yes Gideon's sake it does it's called

4053.58 --> 4058.74
momentum because of the design the force

4056.82 --> 4062.3
is transmitted very efficiently and

4058.74 --> 4062.2999999999997
keeps on going for a long time

4067.099 --> 4078.94
oh yeah yeah thanks for popping by

4075.259 --> 4078.94
Cameron Parker was interesting

4109.06 --> 4111.81
hmm

4113.3 --> 4120.59
yeah then Winfield that's pretty

4116.59 --> 4123.5
so I hear it's pretty freaky like they

4120.59 --> 4129.110000000001
better not push that [ __ ] over here like

4123.5 --> 4131.27
they better not do that because I would

4129.11 --> 4133.219999999999
I would literally have medical

4131.27 --> 4135.02
objections if I'd have to walk her

4133.22 --> 4139.1
especially in the heat with a freaking

4135.02 --> 4140.900000000001
mask up I'd risk choking so if they want

4139.1 --> 4145.22
me to do that that's fine then they can

4140.9 --> 4146.96
also pay for an oxygen tank to add on

4145.22 --> 4149.06
top of that because I'm not gonna walk

4146.96 --> 4151.46
around with the mask if I don't get

4149.06 --> 4155.06
extra oxygen supply with that so that's

4151.46 --> 4156.62
my personal demand and if that's too

4155.06 --> 4159.38
much for them then I'm just gonna walk

4156.62 --> 4161.74
out without a mask because I don't want

4159.38 --> 4161.74
to choke

4173.259 --> 4180.9
yeah Mykleby oh and also I heard a

4176.799 --> 4186.33
fascinating thing that apparently

4180.9 --> 4189.879999999999
against my expectation in Sweden they

4186.33 --> 4191.739
they actually didn't like a really

4189.88 --> 4194.53
interesting thing and he just said like

4191.739 --> 4197.169999999999
no herd immunity no obscure it

4194.53 --> 4200.17
it's just keep on going we're gonna sit

4197.17 --> 4204.27
through it it's brilliant it's like oh

4200.17 --> 4207.25
really so the dude the ultimate liberals

4204.27 --> 4209.320000000001
just has so happened to do the most

4207.25 --> 4211.27
ideal thing why are they the only ones

4209.32 --> 4214.69
doing this is everything else so

4211.27 --> 4217.8
graveled and I'm almost surprised that

4214.69 --> 4221.7
that yeah that the Liberals in there

4217.8 --> 4225.52
haven't stopped it and haven't ruined it

4221.7 --> 4229.21
but no yeah apparently they barely have

4225.52 --> 4232.4800000000005
a crisis over there that just going with

4229.21 --> 4234.94
her immunity fully and the Netherlands

4232.48 --> 4237.04
was kind of like that but still some

4234.94 --> 4241.179999999999
issues because we have a lot of very

4237.04 --> 4247.29
gravely politicians that are just

4241.18 --> 4247.29
intolerable god so this

4247.349 --> 4251.3
Oh what is this again

4256.729 --> 4263.229
yeah yes some of our political parties

4259.76 --> 4270.110000000001
wants more tighter Corona measures

4263.229 --> 4274.429
disgusting guy yeah they better not push

4270.11 --> 4275.9
that [ __ ] like these people that do this

4274.429 --> 4282.679
I just don't get it

4275.9 --> 4285.079
there it's just sick there's no way that

4282.679 --> 4289.119
they don't know what they're doing I

4285.079 --> 4289.119
just don't get it why it's so sick

4309.76 --> 4319.18
right but yeah I'm not even kidding guys

4313.75 --> 4321.22
it seems kind of silly but if it would

4319.18 --> 4323.950000000001
be mandated with masks and [ __ ] that's

4321.22 --> 4326.650000000001
fine I'll take an oxygen tank a small

4323.95 --> 4330.489
one because yeah they do weigh some I'll

4326.65 --> 4333.489
take that with me I put a little wire in

4330.489 --> 4337.299999999999
my mask more like a Darth Vader helmet

4333.489 --> 4342.61
probably so I get extra oxygen because I

4337.3 --> 4345.67
don't want to choke you know if you're

4342.61 --> 4355.8099999999995
gonna sit in the heat the Sun and all

4345.67 --> 4357.9400000000005
and your group that sucks I don't know

4355.81 --> 4360.67
if it's really cold I guess it wouldn't

4357.94 --> 4367.45
even matter that much but if it's really

4360.67 --> 4369.67
warm that just sucks oh Michael Jackson

4367.45 --> 4373.989
yeah Michael Jackson was a big

4369.67 --> 4376.83
germaphobe terrified of it it was very

4373.989 --> 4376.83
very fooled

4394.07 --> 4401.119
[Music]

4397.989 --> 4404.57
oxygen can't tank a dollar dollar dollar

4401.119 --> 4408.23
dollar oh it doesn't have to be you know

4404.57 --> 4410.929
and you don't have to be boy if I'd use

4408.23 --> 4413.69
it I'm not gonna like put it for long no

4410.929 --> 4417.619
no no it's just a little extra a little

4413.69 --> 4422.089999999999
extra that normally shorted because of

4417.619 --> 4426.08
the blockage so I would probably if I'd

4422.09 --> 4427.969
use it just do a very very long time

4426.08 --> 4433.849
with it wouldn't have to be that

4427.969 --> 4437.389
expensive I will get hot yeah well

4433.849 --> 4439.13
that's if you put put the tab open full

4437.389 --> 4441.7390000000005
you know yeah you're gonna get freaking

4439.13 --> 4448.09
high so that's why I say just every very

4441.739 --> 4450.799999999999
little extra in there just a tiny amount

4448.09 --> 4452.78
yeah because Michael Jackson talking

4450.8 --> 4456.05
about Michael Jackson he was oxygen

4452.78 --> 4460.25
addicted do you remember he would go

4456.05 --> 4464.42
intense with just it was kind of he over

4460.25 --> 4466.04
killed with it but yeah there is

4464.42 --> 4471.17
something that's there's something

4466.04 --> 4473.2699999999995
remember to pressure oxygen chambers I

4471.17 --> 4475.04
mean it has to be under pressure it

4473.27 --> 4482.619000000001
actually does some amazing things for

4475.04 --> 4486.139
the body I don't get oxygen addicted

4482.619 --> 4489.11
look I used to deal with it I still can

4486.139 --> 4491.659000000001
you know I'm a goldsmith I have had

4489.11 --> 4493.67
oxygen tanks I just

4491.659 --> 4495.83
my dad has I give to my dad he still

4493.67 --> 4498.9490000000005
does some work he's also kind of into

4495.83 --> 4504.739
goldsmithing a little and then he has

4498.949 --> 4507.469
the room for it so I gave it to him but

4504.739 --> 4509.48
I had a big oxygen tank you and I would

4507.469 --> 4511.55
do a very long time with it it would not

4509.48 --> 4514.339999999999
be that extremely expensive

4511.55 --> 4516.619000000001
it wouldn't be dirt cheap it wouldn't be

4514.34 --> 4519.1990000000005
that expensive I think

4516.619 --> 4522.199
biggest hassle or if it would be that

4519.199 --> 4524.239
it's so freakin heavy that you have to

4522.199 --> 4527.959
haul it and return it and then get a new

4524.239 --> 4531.138999999999
one the hauling was kind of annoying but

4527.959 --> 4534.409
I don't know there are small oxygen

4531.139 --> 4538.909000000001
tanks as well those are like I guess

4534.409 --> 4541.789
four more divers and Nana divers have to

4538.909 --> 4550.938999999999
I don't know I know they are there are

4541.789 --> 4552.679
like small things like that so if you

4550.939 --> 4556.909000000001
get sick that's good for a cover yeah it

4552.679 --> 4558.349
is yeah that's that's remember I don't

4556.909 --> 4559.879
know if anybody here remembers but the

4558.349 --> 4562.429
boomers probably remember but it was

4559.879 --> 4565.039
used to be a thing like okay if you're

4562.429 --> 4569.689
sick or whatever you go to Switzerland

4565.039 --> 4573.8
you go to the high mountains and yeah

4569.689 --> 4577.099
people it was it's apparently very

4573.8 --> 4579.889
healthy environment over there I hope it

4577.099 --> 4581.51
still is it probably still is they're

4579.889 --> 4585.669
they're very careful with pollution

4581.51 --> 4587.929
there and people would get better there

4585.669 --> 4591.26
so it's kind of the same it's just the

4587.929 --> 4593.809
lack of pollution and more oxygen in the

4591.26 --> 4597.459
air there's a lot of woods very little

4593.809 --> 4597.459
pollution and that works

4612.37 --> 4616.92
take just a container to store

4614.02 --> 4619.96
pressurized oxygen at high pressure I

4616.92 --> 4627.97
think it scales so if it's a small

4619.96 --> 4630.91
container you know the smaller it would

4627.97 --> 4632.35
be the less thick the container you know

4630.91 --> 4635.74
it all depends on the total amount of

4632.35 --> 4640.83
pressure in there oxygen injection what

4635.74 --> 4640.83
I wouldn't go there

4661.389 --> 4665.969
PAH hello leb

4684.86 --> 4687.489
it

4695.96 --> 4706.05
right Jorge Sanford yeah that's logical

4703.28 --> 4708.389
scuba tanks thin tank about feeling yeah

4706.05 --> 4710.28
that makes perfect sense but that's also

4708.389 --> 4713.639
because the thickness of the tank with

4710.28 --> 4718.0199999999995
torches is to bypass any risk because

4713.639 --> 4722.46
yeah fire and a punctured or bursting

4718.02 --> 4724.4400000000005
oxygen tank is absolute disaster so

4722.46 --> 4726.449
that's probably also reason why those

4724.44 --> 4740.79
tanks are extra thing if you know what I

4726.449 --> 4743.219
mean and by the way oxygen scuba tanks

4740.79 --> 4747.44
are different right because scuba tanks

4743.219 --> 4752.57
are liquid air they're not pure oxygen

4747.44 --> 4752.57
so it's different like that as well

4771.91 --> 4779.57
hello revolt if people are afraid of

4774.89 --> 4784.64
being near each other well eventually

4779.57 --> 4786.44
when the pressure is high enough people

4784.64 --> 4788.75
won't give a [ __ ] anymore about Corona

4786.44 --> 4791.69
they won't they just won't care anymore

4788.75 --> 4794.78
when they're noticing that all kinds of

4791.69 --> 4796.96
bad things are happening they did won't

4794.78 --> 4800.8099999999995
care about Corona

4796.96 --> 4804.26
and by the way it it's like you have to

4800.81 --> 4806.6
really look carefully not to find anyone

4804.26 --> 4808.1900000000005
that really believes it I almost get the

4806.6 --> 4814.1900000000005
feeling at this point that it's only

4808.19 --> 4815.599999999999
people they're just really stuck into it

4814.19 --> 4817.759999999999
they have nothing better to do they're

4815.6 --> 4821.120000000001
kind of lost into the Corona narrative

4817.76 --> 4823.400000000001
or people that are just spouting it as

4821.12 --> 4826.58
like a corporate operation because I

4823.4 --> 4829.009999999999
don't think anybody out there that is

4826.58 --> 4836.38
even part of media still actually

4829.01 --> 4836.38
believes it it's no way it's just no way

4839.31 --> 4842.359
[Music]

4853.38 --> 4860.92
hmm right mark colored yeah and I'm very

4857.619 --> 4865.57
glad that there are plenty of doctors

4860.92 --> 4869.82
that are just yeah also oppose it the

4865.57 --> 4869.82
situation I'm very happy about it

4870.27 --> 4877.0
that's a great relief gives me the

4874.42 --> 4879.849
feeling that not all doctors are

4877.0 --> 4882.28
complete scam artists because I have a

4879.849 --> 4888.3
natural tendency to kind of distrust

4882.28 --> 4894.28
doctors but that's a personal issue just

4888.3 --> 4896.02
yeah it's it's difficult it just they

4894.28 --> 4898.78
haven't had a lot of good experiences

4896.02 --> 4901.96
with doctor not any specific horrific

4898.78 --> 4911.44
experiences it's just that I've never

4901.96 --> 4914.13
really yeah I never really needed any in

4911.44 --> 4914.129999999999
retrospect

4926.579 --> 4932.34
yeah by the way the whole corona monster

4929.46 --> 4935.699
situation has not bypassed my family

4932.34 --> 4942.03
because apparently my stepmother who has

4935.699 --> 4944.5199999999995
a beauty clinic dot Anil she was forced

4942.03 --> 4947.55
to close down as well under yeah under

4944.52 --> 4951.540000000001
penalty of hefty fines it's like no you

4947.55 --> 4952.2300000000005
just can't do that anymore until until

4951.54 --> 4954.599
it's over

4952.23 --> 4958.169999999999
I think they're not panicking about

4954.599 --> 4965.219
anything but still it's like really

4958.17 --> 4967.829
annoying so yeah this whole this whole

4965.219 --> 4971.909
no so situated the situation better be

4967.829 --> 4975.869
over quick because it's not gonna end

4971.909 --> 4977.909
well if it doesn't and with that I mean

4975.869 --> 4979.71
for the freakin government for the

4977.909 --> 4982.098999999999
people that are pushing this in politics

4979.71 --> 4987.21
it's not gonna end well for them if they

4982.099 --> 4989.76
don't allow the economy and business and

4987.21 --> 4993.0
in people's freaking social lives to

4989.76 --> 4994.969
continue as normal in a time when it's

4993.0 --> 4997.38
really important the spring time

4994.969 --> 5000.17
connectivity and activity is very

4997.38 --> 5002.63
important it's an optimal situation for

5000.17 --> 5006.4
it so this whole corona situation is

5002.63 --> 5006.400000000001
just a giant waste

5010.34 --> 5020.8
no Missouri bear because they live there

5016.63 --> 5020.8
their house is their business

5049.229 --> 5056.519
anyway yeah that's is what it is

5063.659 --> 5069.518999999999
yes Gideon's sake

5065.499 --> 5073.78
yeah it's gonna be the great Corona the

5069.519 --> 5075.820000000001
corona plea of to 2020 where every

5073.78 --> 5077.829
single death ever is going to be a

5075.82 --> 5082.469
corona death and it's like Oh My gods

5077.829 --> 5087.009999999999
like like a hundred million people died

5082.469 --> 5090.76
in the world of Corona and it's like oh

5087.01 --> 5092.679
yeah so isn't that just roughly around

5090.76 --> 5094.659000000001
the average they're not saying that this

5092.679 --> 5096.55
100 million or whatever that it just

5094.659 --> 5099.339999999999
happened to be that number just happened

5096.55 --> 5101.26
to be the average death rate

5099.34 --> 5103.659000000001
yeah the average amount of deaths on a

5101.26 --> 5105.070000000001
yearly basis worldwide it just happened

5103.659 --> 5108.098999999999
to be that exact figure

5105.07 --> 5111.61
you know because nobody nobody that

5108.099 --> 5113.409000000001
everybody that year was immortal except

5111.61 --> 5118.69
if you got Corona and because then you

5113.409 --> 5120.429
die like that see it's it's the year of

5118.69 --> 5124.388999999999
immortality people can only die of

5120.429 --> 5127.03
Corona this year so be careful not to

5124.389 --> 5132.429
die because you will be designated

5127.03 --> 5134.829
Corona yeah but who's gonna fall for

5132.429 --> 5139.539
that really during this age this this

5134.829 --> 5141.249
this thing may only pass after a long

5139.539 --> 5143.018999999999
period and and there's like a new

5141.249 --> 5145.51
generation that haven't even been

5143.019 --> 5147.999
consciously through it really kind of

5145.51 --> 5151.599
passed on to them passed passed them by

5147.999 --> 5153.88
because nothing really happened and they

5151.599 --> 5156.4890000000005
might not even pick up on it afterwards

5153.88 --> 5160.650000000001
it's like oh yeah look the corona yeah

5156.489 --> 5160.65
oh yeah yeah I was little I don't know

5160.739 --> 5168.129999999999
but everybody that's just adults during

5163.719 --> 5170.409
this period it's like nobody here can't

5168.13 --> 5176.159000000001
see what's going on just like nobody

5170.409 --> 5176.159
even even basic people see this [ __ ]

5185.989 --> 5191.2
yeah here's another article

5196.44 --> 5205.03
montana physician dr. NE

5199.0 --> 5209.65
bucha check about tampering with cough

5205.03 --> 5211.54
it 19 death certificate yeah i'll link

5209.65 --> 5213.19
you guys up I don't know there's lots of

5211.54 --> 5217.949
these types of videos going around now

5213.19 --> 5221.259999999999
and that's good but I'll share this one

5217.949 --> 5221.86
seems seems okay you might have seen it

5221.26 --> 5224.4400000000005
before

5221.86 --> 5228.88
these things are now going around like

5224.44 --> 5232.169999999999
crazy they're very high in demand people

5228.88 --> 5234.6990000000005
want doctors to give they're serious

5232.17 --> 5238.2390000000005
honest opinions and not go with the

5234.699 --> 5240.219
system and it's happening everywhere

5238.239 --> 5243.699
it's good to see that it is happening

5240.219 --> 5245.62
makes me very happy to know that there's

5243.699 --> 5249.099999999999
just doctors not going along with this

5245.62 --> 5251.3099999999995
scam or at least trying not to go along

5249.1 --> 5251.31
with it

5266.8 --> 5271.409000000001
Mykleby yeah sure everything's fine over

5269.38 --> 5271.409000000001
there

5283.94 --> 5286.629999999999
hmm

5291.83 --> 5296.42
right well look this is typical you have

5294.71 --> 5300.11
the winter season you have the post

5296.42 --> 5302.06
December season where morality goes

5300.11 --> 5304.549999999999
lower that's typically when people get

5302.06 --> 5308.900000000001
colds and get flu and then it

5304.55 --> 5313.04
transitions into the spring which brings

5308.9 --> 5316.879999999999
in typical pollen and all that allergies

5313.04 --> 5322.43
and all of these things all stack kind

5316.88 --> 5325.04
of so if you're in bad shape then being

5322.43 --> 5329.06
demoralized from post December

5325.04 --> 5332.9
depression can yeah can cause you to

5329.06 --> 5336.5
become sick and if you yeah you're in

5332.9 --> 5340.219999999999
the same situation and you happen to not

5336.5 --> 5343.28
respond all that well on on hey you have

5340.22 --> 5346.7
hay fever or allergies for flowers yeah

5343.28 --> 5349.88
then you may have a similar thing during

5346.7 --> 5353.24
spring you may have risks but that's

5349.88 --> 5358.31
just that that is natural that happens

5353.24 --> 5360.5
every time it's not a infectious thing

5358.31 --> 5362.54
that's just sadly pops up out of nowhere

5360.5 --> 5364.67
spreads around everybody gets it and

5362.54 --> 5367.24
then it just goes away and that doesn't

5364.67 --> 5367.24
make any sense

5384.139 --> 5393.71
oh well damn we I bet they will I

5386.989 --> 5395.449
absolutely did of course they will you

5393.71 --> 5397.82
gotta have some breathing problems in

5395.449 --> 5404.089999999999
the first place if you want to choke on

5397.82 --> 5408.219
on a facemask so yeah you'll definitely

5404.09 --> 5411.429
be classified as Corona that happens

5408.219 --> 5411.429
it's this

5425.23 --> 5430.12
yeah okay

5433.51 --> 5441.9400000000005
hmm that's fine Jon Rappoport okay cool

5442.97 --> 5446.189
[Music]

5448.51 --> 5453.349
so they still have yeah there's more

5451.699 --> 5456.129999999999
wrong with you too by the way

5453.349 --> 5459.079
I don't know if anybody else is noticing

5456.13 --> 5462.889
they still haven't restored the go to

5459.079 --> 5469.13
channel function in the chat so I'm very

5462.889 --> 5473.4490000000005
angry about it's like it is a key

5469.13 --> 5476.389
function a key function it's critical

5473.449 --> 5479.119
for social media connectivity of YouTube

5476.389 --> 5481.150000000001
and they just took it out for no damn

5479.119 --> 5481.15
reason

5482.38 --> 5490.76
so that's terrible but I also noticed

5485.48 --> 5493.369
that they kind of took out the option in

5490.76 --> 5495.38
like with primary pages I can find it in

5493.369 --> 5499.82
mind anymore between the options that

5495.38 --> 5502.01
you want to show recent activity like

5499.82 --> 5504.71
what have you watched recently watched

5502.01 --> 5507.2300000000005
videos it's not an option anymore in

5504.71 --> 5509.81
there either they just took it up so

5507.23 --> 5512.2699999999995
they completely took out connectivity

5509.81 --> 5515.150000000001
elements I can literally now only see on

5512.27 --> 5521.599
my basic on my channel who I am

5515.15 --> 5525.71
subscribed with subscribe to and my my

5521.599 --> 5528.92
own videos that's the only thing I can

5525.71 --> 5534.909
now see on my own page everything else

5528.92 --> 5540.02
is just taken out and it's I I'm gravely

5534.909 --> 5544.79
offended by this really pissed off

5540.02 --> 5547.639
YouTube there's no reason for you to do

5544.79 --> 5550.909
that these functions do not take a

5547.639 --> 5553.909000000001
bandwidth these functions do not take up

5550.909 --> 5556.07
any kind of power that you require

5553.909 --> 5561.67
because you're running out no no no it's

5556.07 --> 5566.32
it's pure it's pure crackdown it's just

5561.67 --> 5570.4400000000005
taking away connectivity from your users

5566.32 --> 5576.949
this is a crime against your own users

5570.44 --> 5581.049999999999
against your own content makers fix it

5576.949 --> 5582.678999999999
restore it fire the people that did this

5581.05 --> 5585.469
I'm serious

5582.679 --> 5588.71
get them out they don't have YouTube in

5585.469 --> 5591.079
their priorities they don't care they're

5588.71 --> 5595.579
just they just took something away for

5591.079 --> 5603.499
no good reason other than to to crack

5595.579 --> 5604.94
down and damage the users it doesn't

5603.499 --> 5607.099
matter if Google doesn't care it doesn't

5604.94 --> 5611.32
matter even if the director doesn't care

5607.099 --> 5615.309
it Google is such a massive company

5611.32 --> 5617.63
millions of people working for it and I

5615.309 --> 5619.999
betcha it's not this is not top-down

5617.63 --> 5622.01
directed the duck down Direction is

5619.999 --> 5628.039
gonna tell you take away the stick no no

5622.01 --> 5630.530000000001
no that makes no sense now it's probably

5628.039 --> 5633.139
somebody on the inside that just thought

5630.53 --> 5634.969
look good you know if we gotta do this

5633.139 --> 5636.769
now because of the corona or something

5634.969 --> 5640.4890000000005
because they Corona panic it's because

5636.769 --> 5642.289000000001
there's a lot of sjw idiots in the

5640.489 --> 5644.768999999999
company as well well it's if it's that

5642.289 --> 5649.57
big is you can't really avoid that so

5644.769 --> 5653.479
but yeah whoever did this is it's just

5649.57 --> 5657.53
attacking the company its shareholders

5653.479 --> 5660.17
its users its content makers it's an

5657.53 --> 5662.449
attack so that it has to be restored it

5660.17 --> 5667.34
has to be restored and people

5662.449 --> 5670.4
responsible have to be fired get it done

5667.34 --> 5673.1900000000005
people in YouTube get it done this is an

5670.4 --> 5676.848999999999
attack on the platform nobody needs this

5673.19 --> 5680.86
you don't need this it's not good for

5676.849 --> 5680.860000000001
anything has to be restored

5685.36 --> 5691.299999999999
[Music]

5688.3 --> 5691.3
right

5701.59 --> 5710.03
so yeah well screw them so I should this

5707.06 --> 5714.17
that that's studia that that is too

5710.03 --> 5716.42
repulsive to even consider that cuz

5714.17 --> 5718.37
social distancing is always only about

5716.42 --> 5720.2
the supposed to the infection rate right

5718.37 --> 5724.01
well how does that make any freaking

5720.2 --> 5732.92
sense digital social kit that's now that

5724.01 --> 5738.320000000001
is no that's unacceptable it is an

5732.92 --> 5741.77
attack on the users for no good reason

5738.32 --> 5745.219999999999
and I consider it criminal I wonder if

5741.77 --> 5748.97
there is criminal implications if you

5745.22 --> 5754.67
could take this to justice to a quarters

5748.97 --> 5757.22
of some kind maybe it's just on the

5754.67 --> 5758.45
giant pile of [ __ ] they've cost so far I

5757.22 --> 5760.16
don't know man maybe this is a

5758.45 --> 5762.71
controlled demolition maybe there's

5760.16 --> 5764.66
people like in the top with Google that

5762.71 --> 5766.54
are literally like okay we're gonna blow

5764.66 --> 5769.46
it up and then get the hell out of here

5766.54 --> 5772.22
jump on to something else before they

5769.46 --> 5775.04
get us before they hold us response

5772.22 --> 5777.530000000001
no what what's going on concerning that

5775.04 --> 5780.17
I just know that these functions haven't

5777.53 --> 5783.7699999999995
been taken away has no good reason

5780.17 --> 5785.6
whatsoever it is only an attack it is an

5783.77 --> 5787.55
attack on the users is an attack on

5785.6 --> 5791.570000000001
shareholders to the attack on

5787.55 --> 5793.84
advertisers it's an attack on content

5791.57 --> 5793.84
makers

5800.719 --> 5808.84
okay Michael we yeah I get um josé's

5804.98 --> 5813.218999999999

5858.78 --> 5862.949
do my best Michael be it's just that

5861.229 --> 5864.84
sometimes there's not a lot of

5862.949 --> 5870.388999999999
maneuvering room there especially when

5864.84 --> 5877.38
Brenda gets in I got that woman person

5870.389 --> 5880.469
whatever oh and by the way

5877.38 --> 5883.650000000001
yeah yesterday's episode when was it

5880.469 --> 5886.409
when did she do that again there yeah

5883.65 --> 5889.289
there was no there's no strike there's

5886.409 --> 5899.268999999999
no not I haven't even effectively been

5889.289 --> 5899.268999999999
demonetized so what's that yesterday

5900.91 --> 5904.98
I remember

5909.69 --> 5912.949
let me check it out

5920.7 --> 5926.07
yep yeah everything's fine

5928.78 --> 5935.949
so yeah you know all these nutcase they

5932.05 --> 5938.5
can all go and attack me but yeah where

5935.949 --> 5948.159
is exactly the offense what exactly did

5938.5 --> 5950.409
I do wrong you know being very honest

5948.159 --> 5955.17
and detailed mostly about most things

5950.409 --> 5955.17
that I bring to the platform

5973.79 --> 5982.91
cinge man what do you call america now

5976.88 --> 5985.64
well depends you know yeah it really all

5982.91 --> 5988.3099999999995
depends on how far it is all gonna be

5985.64 --> 5991.81
pushed how bad it will be made it could

5988.31 --> 5994.580000000001
be a medical police state you know I

5991.81 --> 5999.14
don't know I don't know how far it'll go

5994.58 --> 6003.85
but if it is let if it is all just let

5999.14 --> 6012.85
happen it could go quite literally into

6003.85 --> 6015.63
a Soylent Green type of setup yeah maybe

6012.85 --> 6017.910000000001
we should rewatch that movie again and

6015.63 --> 6020.83
just figure it out

6017.91 --> 6023.68
not just the concept of the movie but

6020.83 --> 6027.94
actually look around and what

6023.68 --> 6031.6900000000005
everybody's liking and then shiver when

6027.94 --> 6033.73
you realize that yeah looking at the

6031.69 --> 6041.679999999999
world now yeah that could actually

6033.73 --> 6044.95
happen that's right watch it again it's

6041.68 --> 6050.89
extremely old now it's I think it's like

6044.95 --> 6054.03
over half a century old now watching

6050.89 --> 6054.030000000001
again and shiver

6057.54 --> 6065.5
that could be America if you let it

6060.88 --> 6068.9800000000005
happen just look at all the details look

6065.5 --> 6072.04
at the setup look at the look the

6068.98 --> 6075.339999999999
subculture every detail of those of that

6072.04 --> 6080.41
movie every detail watch every detail

6075.34 --> 6083.83
just look at it and see how unbelievably

6080.41 --> 6089.3099999999995
and horrifically visionary the movie

6083.83 --> 6089.3099999999995
maker was could be

6099.669 --> 6108.199
yeah but own a plane look you can say

6104.09 --> 6113.150000000001
that now but you gotta remember in that

6108.199 --> 6117.199
movie there is no food it's extremely

6113.15 --> 6124.789
rare it's not allowed to be made foods

6117.199 --> 6128.15
are illegal lots of them it's like a

6124.789 --> 6132.65
superior like people now have these

6128.15 --> 6134.539
ridiculous things with golden watches or

6132.65 --> 6137.388999999999
necklaces or whatever while they have

6134.539 --> 6140.989
like yeah I got strawberry jelly [ __ ]

6137.389 --> 6144.679
yeah you try to find that that yeah

6140.989 --> 6148.388999999999
that's the Soylent Green world and it's

6144.679 --> 6154.28
made like that it's created it's all

6148.389 --> 6156.8
artificially made like that and the

6154.28 --> 6159.169
amoral ization just makes everybody feel

6156.8 --> 6161.959
and think there's nothing they can do

6159.169 --> 6164.389
about it it was never there and it never

6161.959 --> 6167.389
will be back it's pure demoralization

6164.389 --> 6170.84
that may keeps everything in that movie

6167.389 --> 6174.139
the way it is because of course things

6170.84 --> 6177.619000000001
can be made can be grown a lot of Lies

6174.139 --> 6183.86
are in that movie like claims like

6177.619 --> 6189.348999999999
everything is dead claims that

6183.86 --> 6190.999
everything is that see did you really
