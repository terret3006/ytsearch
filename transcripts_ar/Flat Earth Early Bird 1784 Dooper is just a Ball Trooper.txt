274.61 --> 281.47900000000004
[Music]

278.56 --> 285.32
it right in the meanwhile some crazy

281.479 --> 285.32
[ __ ] here over here in the Netherlands

287.36 --> 294.36
happened where forum for

291.36 --> 298.28000000000003
democracy uh party leader you could call

294.36 --> 303.88
it he's kind of like the number one

298.28 --> 303.88
guy he's is attacked again pretty

304.039 --> 310.68
viciously it just keeps

306.6 --> 310.68
happening I mean I think he's

311.84 --> 317.88
okay like nothing too serious but like

315.639 --> 322.759
they just let the guy

317.88 --> 322.759
go the police they just let him

323.479 --> 327.639
go I I don't get

325.65 --> 331.28
[Music]

327.639 --> 335.0
that like the hippoc is like

331.28 --> 339.44
really just got to Ram it

335.0 --> 339.44
in so I'm a bit annoyed about

341.72 --> 349.16
that like a freaking day two days before

345.759 --> 349.16
election I mean this is

353.54 --> 356.72900000000004
[Music]

357.16 --> 361.96000000000004

359.28 --> 365.4
heard heard by now or maybe you haven't

361.96 --> 367.63899999999995
I don't know it's all over the place

365.4 --> 371.28
this new prime minister in

367.639 --> 373.639
Argentine who's like a radical

371.28 --> 376.4
anti-socialist which is kind of cool I

373.639 --> 378.759
guess but there's also immediate

376.4 --> 380.56
suspicion because the guy seems to have

378.759 --> 383.84000000000003
some ties with the

380.56 --> 385.84
WF so it's all like a bit

383.84 --> 388.63899999999995
shaky

385.84 --> 391.4
like don't know exactly what that's

388.639 --> 391.40000000000003
going to be

394.599 --> 399.919
I

395.319 --> 402.52000000000004
mean you don't exactly know how how much

399.919 --> 406.31899999999996
he's going to like actually roll out of

402.52 --> 409.0
WF he might just be like oh no I'll help

406.319 --> 413.24
you guys but

409.0 --> 417.039
no no eatings of bugs over here though

413.24 --> 419.36

417.039 --> 422.56
we know Trudeau is like yeah screw M on

419.36 --> 426.8
country WF for the win but this guy

422.56 --> 426.8
might be slightly different

428.919 --> 433.24

2011 that's something to

1196.12 --> 1200.2399999999998
remember h

1200.28 --> 1205.84
okay ter but what I don't get

1203.08 --> 1209.1999999999998
is if they really need

1205.84 --> 1213.6789999999999
it why are they insisting on retiring

1209.2 --> 1216.679
why can't they just do it again it's

1213.679 --> 1218.48
like I mean you can like it's not like

1216.679 --> 1220.8400000000001
oh you're

1218.48 --> 1224.52

1226.559 --> 1230.1589999999999
it again

1236.24 --> 1241.88
I mean if it's so incredibly important

1239.24 --> 1244.0
then why the hell would you retire I

1241.88 --> 1246.679
just keep playing until I drop dead on

1244.0 --> 1246.679
the F or

1247.87 --> 1250.9199999999998
[Music]

1253.2 --> 1258.29
something Tommy don't be

1257.12 --> 1260.32
mean

1258.29 --> 1262.52
[Music]

1260.32 --> 1265.36
remember Tommy you're talking to a

1262.52 --> 1266.36
people in grief right now it sounds

1265.36 --> 1270.039
weird

1266.36 --> 1270.039
but it kind of

1273.04 --> 1277.1399999999999
[Music]

1282.52 --> 1287.039
is the board will sack you if you don't

1285.96 --> 1291.0
what the

1287.039 --> 1293.6
[ __ ] who the [ __ ] is this [ __ ]

1291.0 --> 1295.24
board are they just a bunch of gravers

1293.6 --> 1297.32
that suck up all the money from

1295.24 --> 1299.96
everybody's love and that's it they do

1297.32 --> 1302.3999999999999
absolutely nothing except make

1299.96 --> 1302.4
everything

1303.6 --> 1308.3999999999999
worse who the hell are these bored

1313.7 --> 1316.9
[Music]

1317.039 --> 1320.039
people

1326.799 --> 1333.08
okay oh Unfortunately they have to leave

1330.0 --> 1336.799
the sport even if fans don't want them

1333.08 --> 1341.08
to you don't get choices as

1336.799 --> 1344.36
players who made that up the board did

1341.08 --> 1348.32
the board make those rules

1344.36 --> 1350.1589999999999
terret maybe India should be uh have a

1348.32 --> 1352.559
little Sports

1350.159 --> 1356.1200000000001
Revolution

1352.559 --> 1358.52
maybe kick those filthy Grapplers out

1356.12 --> 1360.1589999999999
and their six billion that they made you

1358.52 --> 1363.1589999999999
just said that

1360.159 --> 1366.88
right and

1363.159 --> 1369.159
like maybe turn the rules around maybe

1366.88 --> 1372.88
the rules for those players should apply

1369.159 --> 1372.88
to the board and not the

1376.96 --> 1379.96
players

1390.4 --> 1397.5590000000002
I mean who determines that it works that

1394.4 --> 1399.799
way and why why is it so important like

1397.559 --> 1401.559
everybody agrees with that everybody

1399.799 --> 1406.279
agrees that when they're too old they

1401.559 --> 1406.279
should retire like really do they

1406.88 --> 1409.88
really

1414.96 --> 1418.039
maybe find new

1419.0 --> 1423.4
Heroes want to enact the life of

1426.279 --> 1432.799
Ryan oh new players gets

1429.44 --> 1432.799
preferred who

1436.52 --> 1441.96
cares if they they're really favored why

1439.6 --> 1444.3999999999999
should they be forced to retire I mean

1441.96 --> 1446.559
if they just start to suck because

1444.4 --> 1449.3200000000002
they're too old or they got some issue

1446.559 --> 1451.24
or what right yeah of course you're not

1449.32 --> 1453.36
going to play when you just suck but

1451.24 --> 1456.44
just because you get older and like oh

1453.36 --> 1458.799
I'm not a super Flex anymore like who

1456.44 --> 1461.0
cares if you're good at it you're good

1458.799 --> 1461.0

caram good morning funny

1493.0 --> 1496.52
things I'm not

1496.76 --> 1499.76
Japanese

1500.91 --> 1504.209
[Music]

1506.88 --> 1514.71
hey dank good to see you how are you

1509.0 --> 1514.71
[Music]

1522.159 --> 1529.24
doing man the other day I've almost

1525.72 --> 1530.6000000000001
forgot when when was that yesterday hold

1529.24 --> 1534.36
let me

1530.6 --> 1537.76
check mind unveiled had another freaky

1534.36 --> 1543.9189999999999
ass video man I think it might have even

1537.76 --> 1543.919
been from two days ago when was

1544.08 --> 1550.9189999999999
it was it still Sunday damn I completely

1548.279 --> 1550.919
forgot about

1551.039 --> 1558.2
it like what the hell these things like

1555.96 --> 1560.3600000000001
really make your eyes Twi witch

1558.2 --> 1563.919
sometimes or they do with

1560.36 --> 1566.7199999999998
me apparently there was this plant

1563.919 --> 1570.1200000000001
homunculus a plant that grows like a

1566.72 --> 1572.279
fruit that's exactly shaped like a sheep

1570.12 --> 1575.1589999999999
like a little

1572.279 --> 1579.2
lamb and it's a fruit like you can eat

1575.159 --> 1582.64
it it's it just really creepily makes it

1579.2 --> 1585.96
look like a little lamb but it's all

1582.64 --> 1589.6000000000001
just a fruit you can like get stuff off

1585.96 --> 1593.24
of it it has like this

1589.6 --> 1596.6
sweet red juice in

1593.24 --> 1598.84
it almost like blood but it's all sweet

1596.6 --> 1601.279
it's like a fruit it's so freaky

1598.84 --> 1602.8799999999999
apparently that thing exists it might

1601.279 --> 1605.919
still exist

1602.88 --> 1607.5200000000002
somewhere but holy [ __ ] man does that

1605.919 --> 1611.44
make things

1607.52 --> 1613.96
weird like really weird

1611.44 --> 1621.1200000000001
because if there is such a thing as

1613.96 --> 1621.1200000000001
sacrificing a lamb to like a god

1621.24 --> 1628.919
remember like Old Testament God

1625.0 --> 1634.12
sacrificing a lamb and then there's this

1628.919 --> 1637.1200000000001
plant that has a lamb

1634.12 --> 1637.12
fruit

1641.72 --> 1649.52
what so yeah definitely check that out

1644.48 --> 1649.52
if you haven't because oh my God

1655.72 --> 1663.24
like this [ __ ] like blows my mind man

1659.24 --> 1663.24
the fra implications are

1663.64 --> 1666.64
insane

1666.919 --> 1672.1200000000001
anyway hey

1668.64 --> 1672.1200000000001
dupons good to see

1676.519 --> 1679.519
you

1706.44 --> 1709.44
for

1710.48 --> 1715.559
all right well yeah

1712.96 --> 1718.0
teret it's interesting that you describe

1715.559 --> 1721.72
it right players that play amazing games

1718.0 --> 1725.039
and then like blunder in

1721.72 --> 1727.679
competition it's very

1725.039 --> 1730.48
typical it's like an effect there's like

1727.679 --> 1733.6000000000001
an esoteric little effect happening

1730.48 --> 1735.84
there I recognize it cuz I have

1733.6 --> 1739.039
something like that it's like when it

1735.84 --> 1742.6399999999999
doesn't matter everything is like

1739.039 --> 1747.24
magical like Works magically but then

1742.64 --> 1750.2
like on a thing that's like really on

1747.24 --> 1753.519
display it almost like changes how it

1750.2 --> 1755.2
all works and it reminds me of the

1753.519 --> 1758.799
knowing which

1755.2 --> 1760.519
path effect like wave function

1758.799 --> 1764.0
collapsing it's because there is an

1760.519 --> 1766.0
attention there on it like if it really

1764.0 --> 1769.24
matters that just that effect just

1766.0 --> 1771.919
doesn't unleash it's like this

1769.24 --> 1773.559
little like a snail's eye just only

1771.919 --> 1776.3990000000001
comes out when it's really calm and then

1773.559 --> 1778.0
it's like wao it's there but when it's

1776.399 --> 1780.12
there's a lot of hassle it just doesn't

1778.0 --> 1783.799
come

1780.12 --> 1785.76
out and that happens in some

1783.799 --> 1788.039
sports we have that here in the

1785.76 --> 1791.96
Netherlands too with our

1788.039 --> 1796.32
football with our soccer a lot I mean

1791.96 --> 1799.32
the fans here it has happened a

1796.32 --> 1799.32
lot

1799.399 --> 1803.2399999999998
where some of our players are like real

1801.44 --> 1805.76
Crushers they're and they're just

1803.24 --> 1808.32
awesome and they did make they do like

1805.76 --> 1808.32
amazing

1809.559 --> 1816.399
feats like crazy kicks and all that and

1813.84 --> 1818.399
it's just amazing and like yeah people

1816.399 --> 1820.4399999999998
kind of worship them too a little

1818.399 --> 1823.279
because of that but then when it really

1820.44 --> 1825.88
matters then it like doesn't work and

1823.279 --> 1828.08
that typically that's like so typical

1825.88 --> 1830.519
with Dutch it's like it Rems me of what

1828.08 --> 1833.24
you're describing it's the same effect

1830.519 --> 1835.48
like these players are legends but then

1833.24 --> 1838.32
when it really matters they just it

1835.48 --> 1841.3990000000001
doesn't come out it just collapses and

1838.32 --> 1843.32
then they're still disciplined a lot

1841.399 --> 1845.76
these players here like they have these

1843.32 --> 1849.48
systems like so they're always going to

1845.76 --> 1851.919
do their best and it's not going to like

1849.48 --> 1855.1200000000001
completely

1851.919 --> 1859.5590000000002
collapse but they then the magic just

1855.12 --> 1859.559
doesn't really happen it's very

1861.0 --> 1866.799
typical Dutch were here to in my city

1864.12 --> 1870.4399999999998
they did well at the world oh

1866.799 --> 1874.279
okay okay I don't yeah I'm not talking

1870.44 --> 1877.2
about Cricket I I've seen football I

1874.279 --> 1880.12
followed football a bit I'm not like oh

1877.2 --> 1882.0800000000002
I know all the clubs and uh the names of

1880.12 --> 1885.4799999999998
the players

1882.08 --> 1888.24
no it's just like the one sport I've

1885.48 --> 1891.44
sort of kind of like paid attention

1888.24 --> 1895.559
to cuz I'm just not really into

1891.44 --> 1895.559
sports like that watching

1896.519 --> 1901.2
sports but I've paid enough attention my

1899.2 --> 1904.039
dad's been like a football fan a lot of

1901.2 --> 1907.8400000000001
the time a lot of his life not so much

1904.039 --> 1910.76
anymore I think getting too old for that

1907.84 --> 1913.1589999999999
[ __ ] but so I know about it through that

1910.76 --> 1915.519
and that just typically happens like

1913.159 --> 1919.48
they do magical

1915.519 --> 1923.039
things but like like as a surplus it's

1919.48 --> 1925.88
like we call it for the room for the

1923.039 --> 1927.919
fame it's just this magic it just

1925.88 --> 1931.0390000000002
happens but it doesn't matter it's like

1927.919 --> 1933.159
magical but it happens when it doesn't

1931.039 --> 1937.2
matter and then when it really does

1933.159 --> 1940.0
matter it doesn't come out it's so

1937.2 --> 1943.279
[Music]

1940.0 --> 1946.48
typical and we call our soccer players

1943.279 --> 1951.559
Legends too because of because of that

1946.48 --> 1951.559
effect cuz that specific type of effect

1953.679 --> 1959.039
happens Club football it's way bigger

1956.519 --> 1959.039
International

1961.679 --> 1969.72
football Ronaldo

1965.36 --> 1973.12
yeah yeah Ronaldo that's so crazy but it

1969.72 --> 1976.1200000000001
happens with him too right I mean some

1973.12 --> 1977.9599999999998
it it sometimes he just succeeds but it

1976.12 --> 1981.1999999999998
typically does end up happening now it's

1977.96 --> 1984.44
like all this so much expectation he had

1981.2 --> 1986.67
so incredible Feats but I mean he is

1984.44 --> 1990.479
getting a a lot older and all

1986.67 --> 1990.479
[Music]

1992.039 --> 1995.279
that and I

1995.519 --> 2002.039
mean like

1998.2 --> 2002.039
Cricket is not like

2003.679 --> 2012.48
a a sport that like Bur burdens your

2007.919 --> 2015.519
phys physique a lot right I mean

2012.48 --> 2020.1200000000001
football soccer like really wears you

2015.519 --> 2023.08
out you get like damage and [ __ ] and

2020.12 --> 2024.84
like it wears you out I mean Cricket is

2023.08 --> 2027.8799999999999
not

2024.84 --> 2032.639
like a running and bashing around Sport

2027.88 --> 2035.3990000000001
and kicking and like tackling right it's

2032.639 --> 2035.399
not like that at

2035.96 --> 2042.1200000000001
all

2038.36 --> 2044.559
so I mean is there running involved in

2042.12 --> 2047.039
cricket I feel kind of weird now because

2044.559 --> 2050.399
I realized I don't even completely know

2047.039 --> 2052.24
how Cricket works is there like running

2050.399 --> 2054.159
kind of like baseball I always thought

2052.24 --> 2056.879
of it like oh it's just like baseball

2054.159 --> 2058.56
except you do with a bat and it's thrown

2056.879 --> 2060.839
against the ground the ball and you have

2058.56 --> 2060.839
to

2061.0 --> 2065.879
hit like the thrower has to hit the

2063.879 --> 2068.879
sticks behind you or

2065.879 --> 2068.879
something

2069.599 --> 2073.839
but is there any running involved like

2071.639 --> 2073.839
with

2080.079 --> 2084.7200000000003
baseball fast bowling

2084.8 --> 2090.639
okay physically

2087.72 --> 2095.1189999999997
demanding yeah but is it I mean do

2090.639 --> 2097.48
people like get into accidents and [ __ ]

2095.119 --> 2099.76
because it's so physically demanding

2097.48 --> 2101.72
lots of running oh okay okay fair enough

2099.76 --> 2105.2400000000002
okay so there is some physical strain

2101.72 --> 2107.839
then that where [ __ ] can go wrong

2105.24 --> 2110.7599999999998
right okay fair enough D I didn't know

2107.839 --> 2114.56
that I wasn't

2110.76 --> 2116.88
sure but I mean in cricket it's not

2114.56 --> 2118.92
common that people like bash into each

2116.88 --> 2121.48
other and tackle each other right that

2118.92 --> 2123.96
sort of stuff doesn't happen at all like

2121.48 --> 2126.64
in football my point was is that in

2123.96 --> 2128.96
football is just it it's more logical

2126.64 --> 2132.52
than as you age that you'll just be worn

2128.96 --> 2132.52
out you just won't be able to

2134.04 --> 2138.079
perform more than just because of

2140.4 --> 2145.86
running no collisions

2142.64 --> 2145.8599999999997
[Music]

2148.04 --> 2155.4
right it may happen rarely okay right

2152.2 --> 2157.96
well like so it is like in baseball it

2155.4 --> 2161.319
can happen but it it rarely happens

2157.96 --> 2163.56
right running you can run into

2161.319 --> 2165.68
somebody bash into each other but like

2163.56 --> 2167.7599999999998
but it's not like a typical thing that

2165.68 --> 2171.75
would happen like in

2167.76 --> 2174.2000000000003
football right okay fair

2171.75 --> 2176.48
[Music]

2174.2 --> 2179.72
enough yeah of course running has its

2176.48 --> 2181.839
own hazards right if there's running

2179.72 --> 2184.9199999999996
involved and speed really matters then

2181.839 --> 2187.599
yes there will be a wearing out people

2184.92 --> 2190.52
will put the like their body on the

2187.599 --> 2193.4
brink to like maximize the speed and all

2190.52 --> 2197.0
that and that things go wrong you gamble

2193.4 --> 2197.0
with your body on the long run

2204.68 --> 2212.64
[Music]

2208.2 --> 2215.64

Cricket are high

2303.52 --> 2309.319
quality okay terret if you say

2312.68 --> 2319.48
so I mean maybe that is a thing with

2316.4 --> 2323.44
Cricket is that if you're into Cricket

2319.48 --> 2323.44
that is considered high quality I

2325.28 --> 2329.3190000000004

2328.2 --> 2332.31

tendency to like throw things like

2473.64 --> 2480.72
off mountains and

2477.119 --> 2483.839
[ __ ] I have no idea they have it with

2480.72 --> 2488.72
tables and things that we make

2483.839 --> 2488.72
humans but like do they do it in nature

2491.119 --> 2499.079
too I mean I've seen birds be kind of

2497.24 --> 2501.839
like

2499.079 --> 2504.8390000000004
weird there's some birds that I've seen

2501.839 --> 2507.44
that literally like to put rocks on the

edge of of

really it's

2515.24 --> 2518.24
weird

2528.119 --> 2531.839
ter don't call him that

2545.16 --> 2550.359
please

2547.52 --> 2553.44
and he would probably say look who who's

2550.359 --> 2556.2799999999997
talking man from

2553.44 --> 2559.52
India but then again he might be from

2556.28 --> 2562.1600000000003
California or uh from San Francisco then

2559.52 --> 2564.8
he wouldn't probably say

2562.16 --> 2569.5989999999997
that because then you would say look who

2564.8 --> 2569.599
man from San Francisco Look Who's

2573.76 --> 2580.96
Talking oh that would be terrible man if

2576.599 --> 2583.28
Dupo actually lived in San Francisco and

2580.96 --> 2585.04
people call him pooper scooper I mean I

2583.28 --> 2587.48
can't imagine why that would really get

2585.04 --> 2587.48
to him

2589.599 --> 2597.8
then stop being protective of don't tell

2592.76 --> 2597.8
me what to do he's not been

2605.079 --> 2608.079
malicious

2612.64 --> 2616.5589999999997
he called himself that on

2619.68 --> 2627.04
YouTube now he called himself not booer

2624.359 --> 2628.92
scooper and then he realized he couldn't

2645.72 --> 2649.0
change your name back for

2659.599 --> 2663.6400000000003

he probably at this point he's not

ah right

3721.48 --> 3725.2
Nathan thrown out the

3739.68 --> 3744.48
link okay teret but I think you're

3742.319 --> 3747.68
overgeneralizing too much with this I

3744.48 --> 3750.4
really do I think that you may have been

3747.68 --> 3752.68
looking too much into astrology it does

3750.4 --> 3756.52
that to

3752.68 --> 3758.72
you what the [ __ ] are you doing here

3756.52 --> 3761.68

3758.72 --> 3764.52

[Music]

3784.799 --> 3788.24
I think I got to give him some food so

3786.88 --> 3789.4
otherwise it's just not going to leave

3788.24 --> 3792.0389999999998
me

3789.4 --> 3793.4
alone and by doing that though I

3792.039 --> 3795.48
guarantee that it's probably going to do

3793.4 --> 3797.599
it again but I mean he's probably going

3795.48 --> 3800.599
to do it again

3797.599 --> 3803.96
anyway okay

3800.599 --> 3808.839
kitty I could actually put the coffee on

3803.96 --> 3808.839
maybe that's an idea I think I'll do

3809.76 --> 3814.2000000000003
that I still have to think of like what

3812.72 --> 3816.359
kind of a title I'm going to give

3814.2 --> 3820.0
Today's

3816.359 --> 3823.799
show it's a lot of community talk

3820.0 --> 3828.48
really what's astrology got to do Got to

3823.799 --> 3831.0
Do With It uh no I'm not it's not the

3828.48 --> 3833.64
astrology that has a direct relation

3831.0 --> 3835.88
with it it is what astrology does with a

3833.64 --> 3839.839
person

3835.88 --> 3843.359
ter it talking about

3839.839 --> 3845.72
spiritual metadata type effects it's

3843.359 --> 3849.7599999999998
side effects side effect of being

3845.72 --> 3851.7599999999998
involved with it you get Mass

3849.76 --> 3854.039
overgeneralization that's what it does

3851.76 --> 3856.88
that's what astrology does with people

3854.039 --> 3856.88
that practice

3857.4 --> 3864.2400000000002
it it's not malicious it's just a

3861.039 --> 3865.7200000000003
natural effect that happens because of

3864.24 --> 3869.0
doing that a

3865.72 --> 3870.839
lot when you stop doing it that effect

3869.0 --> 3874.0
goes

3870.839 --> 3875.5589999999997
away it's not malicious it's just a

3874.0 --> 3879.4
natural side

3875.559 --> 3881.88
effect I've seen it I've seen like like

3879.4 --> 3884.079
women that're like really into astrology

3881.88 --> 3886.6800000000003
and like that's like they always think

3884.079 --> 3890.0
about it like and if they lose track

3886.68 --> 3892.359
because they just overgeneralize

3890.0 --> 3896.0
everything they stop looking at the

3892.359 --> 3899.96
actual moment and like

3896.0 --> 3901.6
the impulses and they just start boxing

3899.96 --> 3904.81
things

there's a giant

3928.68 --> 3933.0389999999998
conspiracy theory around

3937.44 --> 3943.2400000000002
you and you didn't have to do anything

3940.24 --> 3943.24
to make that

3949.76 --> 3956.3190000000004
happen since when did YouTube start

3952.44 --> 3956.319
putting in adverts onl live

3956.839 --> 3962.72

okay they've been doing that with Nathan

3972.279 --> 3977.92
streams for years

3975.2 --> 3980.279
though I've seen it for a very long time

3977.92 --> 3982.76
where just you're watching a live stream

3980.279 --> 3986.0
and suddenly ad pops up in the middle of

3982.76 --> 3986.0
the live stream I've seen that

4005.24 --> 4012.799
lot right anyway I I'm going to feed the

4254.08 --> 4258.4
over the world or something like come

4264.36 --> 4271.12
on I mean you can tell the difference

4267.52 --> 4274.360000000001
between somebody being a malignant

4271.12 --> 4277.679
infiltrator and just kind of being a a

4274.36 --> 4277.679
general numpty or

okay none of you saw that

4489.239 --> 4495.839999999999
coming I saw it coming for a little bit

4493.52 --> 4497.8
but it's not because of social behavior

4495.84 --> 4500.04
it's because of like the timings and

4497.8 --> 4502.88
things when he showed

4500.04 --> 4507.12
up right I keep track of when people

4502.88 --> 4511.679
first show up in my chat it's weird I do

4507.12 --> 4515.96
that I have just like this weird long

4511.679 --> 4519.4
history bar virtual in which is like

4515.96 --> 4520.8
when did you appear on the bar I have a

4519.4 --> 4523.96
memory for

4520.8 --> 4526.4400000000005

4523.96 --> 4529.8

actually yeah that's how I know or

4533.08 --> 4540.8
wumble like no that's

4536.92 --> 4540.8

4583.44 --> 4589.44
people you

4585.239 --> 4589.44

4589.6 --> 4595.76

earlier so

4790.04 --> 4797.4

[Music]

4846.52 --> 4852.4400000000005
know so are you just joking or is that a

4849.639 --> 4854.719
confession cuz I will kick you out no

4852.44 --> 4854.719
problem

4855.32 --> 4860.5199999999995
see see teret see how simple this

4877.52 --> 4880.7390000000005
[Music]

4881.639 --> 4884.639
works

4884.96 --> 4894.159
yeah so there you go Dr

4889.0 --> 4894.159
utar and I knew it I kind of knew

4903.48 --> 4910.4
it confessionals yeah no but there's a

4906.719 --> 4910.4
whole range of

4911.639 --> 4914.639
people

4918.159 --> 4922.4
the the name kind of already gave it

4923.56 --> 4927.6
away you can see it in a

4929.76 --> 4936.52
name I just because I suspected Dr utar

4933.32 --> 4939.28
for a long time it's just that he's he's

4936.52 --> 4942.040000000001
a nice act so there's nothing I can do

4939.28 --> 4944.08
except wait until he thinks it's a right

4942.04 --> 4945.84
moment to shock us all by revealing it

4944.08 --> 4948.679
was an infiltrant so I can kick him out

4945.84 --> 4950.679
and move on without a Flinch cuz that's

4948.679 --> 4953.4800000000005
the only thing they can do when they go

4950.679 --> 4953.4800000000005
with that type of

4953.639 --> 4959.2390000000005
fact they can just try to get to Your

4956.199 --> 4961.28
Heart by giving unexpectedly giving up a

4959.239 --> 4963.32
a friendship an apparent friendship

4961.28 --> 4966.0
that's what they do it's this is like

4963.32 --> 4968.0
the fourth time now it Absol and I've

4966.0 --> 4970.08
seen it coming I knew Dr utar was going

4968.0 --> 4971.56
to do that it's just there's no point in

4970.08 --> 4973.5199999999995
saying it

4971.56 --> 4976.92
because

4973.52 --> 4976.92
he'd probably then hang
