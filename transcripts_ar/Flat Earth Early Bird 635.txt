[Music]

102.64 --> 109.2
look so yeah it's been storming

106.079 --> 112.83999999999999
and raining pretty much all night

109.2 --> 115.28
and yeah even now it's just steadily

112.84 --> 117.119
clouded there's no real sun coming

115.28 --> 118.96000000000001
through but there is rain every now and

117.119 --> 122.88
then

118.96 --> 126.479
and it's still kind of warmish

122.88 --> 126.479
but nothing like yesterday

127.439 --> 132.239
it sounds like a lot of people are

130.319 --> 134.48
working out there

132.239 --> 135.68
probably using the decrease in

134.48 --> 138.07999999999998
temperature to get

135.68 --> 138.08
active

140.959 --> 145.84

185.04 --> 187.67999999999998
now

186.159 --> 189.519
but i'm getting used to it getting the

187.68 --> 192.8
routine uh

189.519 --> 198.4
right so yeah i had a very late night

192.8 --> 201.36
last night it's crazy situation yeah

198.4 --> 201.36
it was a storm

202.159 --> 210.239
and then like yeah

206.56 --> 213.12
my the other roommate and his girlfriend

210.239 --> 214.159
had like this i don't know what the [ __ ]

213.12 --> 217.20000000000002
they were doing

214.159 --> 219.599
having sex and just crying and it was

217.2 --> 220.64
so annoying they did like up until like

219.599 --> 224.72
half past

220.64 --> 226.95899999999997
one very aggravating

224.72 --> 227.92
i have to do that again i'm next time i

226.959 --> 230.48
am gonna like

227.92 --> 232.55999999999997
get really seriously pissed off just

230.48 --> 235.599

232.56 --> 238.4
right now i'm gonna call the police

235.599 --> 240.159
this is absolutely insane can't do that

238.4 --> 242.4
in the middle of the night there's no

240.159 --> 242.4
way

242.879 --> 246.239
and if you don't have your girlfriend

244.48 --> 247.51899999999998
under control then i don't care if it's

246.239 --> 249.84
in the middle of the night you're gonna

247.519 --> 253.20000000000002
just send her away

249.84 --> 254.879
you know it's as simple as that anyway

253.2 --> 257.199
uh

254.879 --> 258.479
but i did spend that time uh yeah

257.199 --> 262.16
watching a really

258.479 --> 265.75899999999996
awesome movie that

262.16 --> 267.68
yeah that kind of made it all right

265.759 --> 269.91900000000004
but anyway uh let's get it in

267.68 --> 272.24
chronological order so

269.919 --> 273.03999999999996
flat earth early bird yesterday i

272.24 --> 275.04
thought it was an

273.04 --> 278.40000000000003
awesome show i didn't watch it back but

275.04 --> 280.16
just going from memory

278.4 --> 283.28
a lot of technicals a lot of

280.16 --> 286.72
explanations back and forth i liked it

283.28 --> 288.79999999999995
it's on point uh

286.72 --> 290.0
yeah there was no flat earth debates

288.8 --> 293.12
live after that

290.0 --> 294.88
i don't know why it just started yeah

293.12 --> 297.199
nathan started up a premiere didn't

294.88 --> 299.44
really give an explanation

297.199 --> 300.88
maybe his computer gave out again you

299.44 --> 302.4
know seems to be having a lot of

300.88 --> 305.039
computer problems and hey

302.4 --> 306.4
if you're gonna fix things put new stuff

305.039 --> 310.0
in there

306.4 --> 313.039
that tends to yeah

310.0 --> 314.0
cause more mess you know you have to be

313.039 --> 316.24
kind of lucky

314.0 --> 318.72
when you assemble a computer and install

316.24 --> 320.24
everything that it all works out

318.72 --> 322.96000000000004
that's why there's a lot of people out

320.24 --> 323.28000000000003
there that do very extensive research on

322.96 --> 326.4
this

323.28 --> 328.4
electronics computer geeks and there's

326.4 --> 330.4
websites for that i think nathan should

328.4 --> 332.15999999999997
know that

330.4 --> 333.919
but yeah once you get a really good

332.16 --> 336.24
combination of computer going

333.919 --> 336.96
and it finds its balance it's like a

336.24 --> 339.12
balanced

336.96 --> 340.79999999999995
computer spirit whatever you're gonna

339.12 --> 344.16
regard it as

340.8 --> 345.84000000000003
like mine it's gonna last incredibly

344.16 --> 349.52000000000004
long especially if you

345.84 --> 351.919
really take good care of it

349.52 --> 353.44
and respect it don't yell at it in that

351.919 --> 356.639
sort of nonsense

353.44 --> 360.08
you know because that does influence

356.639 --> 361.199
you might be surprised uh you know we're

360.08 --> 365.19899999999996
kind of electric

361.199 --> 365.199
it's electric so yeah

365.6 --> 370.40000000000003
right but yeah once you get a good

368.479 --> 371.35999999999996
system going can go on forever but if

370.4 --> 374.31899999999996
something just

371.36 --> 376.319
is broken and you replace it you got to

374.319 --> 378.16
be lucky that it all just starts working

376.319 --> 380.0
because new problems may arrive i hope

378.16 --> 382.319
that's not the case with nathan but it

380.0 --> 383.68
might be now he's had been having a lot

382.319 --> 385.91900000000004
of computer breakdowns

383.68 --> 387.28000000000003
this would be the third time if it was

385.919 --> 389.19899999999996
actually the case i don't know i haven't

387.28 --> 393.28
heard him out on it

389.199 --> 397.039
uh but yeah own benjamin was live

393.28 --> 400.71999999999997
was pretty good uh

397.039 --> 400.71999999999997
i didn't make any specific notes

401.68 --> 406.96
right also watched alex jones at david

404.96 --> 410.56
icon

406.96 --> 412.0
and yeah it's it's not exactly what it

410.56 --> 414.96
used to be

412.0 --> 416.16
but it's i don't know still interesting

414.96 --> 419.12
to see their

416.16 --> 419.84000000000003
i guess refined generic approach and

419.12 --> 423.199
things and

419.84 --> 425.67999999999995
like bragging how they'll call it and

423.199 --> 426.479
how that works blah blah blah it's still

425.68 --> 428.56
i don't know

426.479 --> 430.24
i like it because i used to follow him

428.56 --> 433.039
way back

430.24 --> 434.24
it's just it's good to keep track like

433.039 --> 436.639
that but i don't follow

434.24 --> 438.40000000000003
like his channels every day or anything

436.639 --> 439.52
although he does have good videos every

438.4 --> 442.56
now and then

439.52 --> 444.79999999999995
uh and he

442.56 --> 446.639
is definitely on the covet hoax early on

444.8 --> 449.28000000000003
i like that

446.639 --> 451.199
right after that just movies i watch

449.28 --> 454.23999999999995
karate kid too

451.199 --> 457.12
yay uh

454.24 --> 459.12
yeah everybody's know exactly everything

457.12 --> 460.08
about that movie had some weird moments

459.12 --> 462.639
in it

460.08 --> 464.479
and yeah it's still pretty pretty decent

462.639 --> 466.479
movie i think

464.479 --> 467.599
i had some weird moments in it but so

466.479 --> 469.84
did the first one

467.599 --> 470.96
anyway and then after that it pretty

469.84 --> 472.4
much in the middle of the night i

470.96 --> 474.96
started watching

472.4 --> 478.23999999999995
a dutch movie that i had heard about i'd

474.96 --> 480.23999999999995
seen some kind of dutch review of it

478.24 --> 481.759
but i've never seen it before and i'm

480.24 --> 483.039
kind of surprised because it's totally

481.759 --> 487.28000000000003
down my lane it's called

483.039 --> 491.199
michio and it's all

487.28 --> 493.28
in language so there's british

491.199 --> 495.12
there's french and there's dutch and

493.28 --> 496.08
they all speak their own language it's

495.12 --> 499.36
really awesome

496.08 --> 501.039
i thought it was and yeah it's a history

499.36 --> 504.47900000000004
piece about michelle the

501.039 --> 507.84
writer in the early dutch situation

504.479 --> 507.84
and well

508.479 --> 512.7189999999999
yeah they put it down as like there's

510.24 --> 513.519
the the republicans and there's the

512.719 --> 515.36
nobility

513.519 --> 517.68
that was really the main stance of it

515.36 --> 520.479
and i've never seen it

517.68 --> 524.0
just put down like that i don't know i

520.479 --> 526.24
thought it was a fascinating movie

524.0 --> 527.44
and i really liked the main character he

526.24 --> 531.519
was such

527.44 --> 534.32
like oh [ __ ] yeah [ __ ] yeah like

531.519 --> 535.279
he's just like this the hague guy that's

534.32 --> 538.72
really awesome

535.279 --> 541.76
and like mega based

538.72 --> 542.72
has a like a yeah pretty gorgeous wife

541.76 --> 546.0
and like

542.72 --> 548.8000000000001
like three baby girls

546.0 --> 549.839
or well there's yeah in the teens but

548.8 --> 553.1999999999999
like that guy is like

549.839 --> 556.32
so crushing it was very

553.2 --> 558.72
very inspiring like and like man the

556.32 --> 560.5600000000001
whole thing is all about marine battles

558.72 --> 563.12
like they

560.56 --> 564.0799999999999
a lot of was cgi but i think i remember

563.12 --> 566.24
that they

564.08 --> 569.0400000000001
they have this typical practical effect

566.24 --> 572.24
where they basically blow up

569.04 --> 574.399
wood chips like almost like confetti

572.24 --> 576.16
explosions after a while you know with

574.399 --> 578.08
the first one it's like holy [ __ ] that's

576.16 --> 579.68
like something real that's exploding you

578.08 --> 582.9590000000001
can literally see the stuff

579.68 --> 584.399
hitting the people and all that but then

582.959 --> 585.3599999999999
after a while you start to see it like

584.399 --> 586.959
whoa that's like

585.36 --> 589.36
every time it's like almost like a

586.959 --> 591.04
confetti blast that has like the right

589.36 --> 594.08
color of the wood it's

591.04 --> 597.279
it's pretty smart but it is

594.08 --> 600.0
like a trick and but

597.279 --> 601.6
man so many marine battles is just crazy

600.0 --> 605.839
like cannons and [ __ ] and

601.6 --> 607.519
blow up the whole place and yeah

605.839 --> 610.24
i don't know if if you hadn't seen that

607.519 --> 613.279
one pretty damn good oh yeah and like

610.24 --> 616.32
oh man the characters were all good

613.279 --> 616.32
and they all

616.56 --> 624.56
served their function they i don't know

620.079 --> 626.399
very nicely directed movie i think

624.56 --> 629.04
like that the king of england is like

626.399 --> 632.0
one of my favorite british actors

629.04 --> 632.399
and what's his name again i forgot but

632.0 --> 636.079
like

632.399 --> 638.24
oh i thought the whole movie was pretty

636.079 --> 642.64
damn amazing

638.24 --> 646.0790000000001
so yeah me feel the writer with an

642.64 --> 650.399
ij by the way it's really funny

646.079 --> 650.399
just like our win right

652.31 --> 658.079
[Music]

655.2 --> 662.0790000000001
oh yeah also man there's some really

658.079 --> 662.079
awesome speeches in there as well

663.31 --> 666.4699999999999
[Music]

668.8 --> 675.8389999999999
like for a movie that's been made pretty

671.279 --> 678.16
recently it's pretty astounding how

675.839 --> 679.6
how well they caught the old spirit of

678.16 --> 682.7199999999999
the netherlands

679.6 --> 682.72
it's pretty impressive

683.68 --> 691.279
so i don't know

688.32 --> 691.839
yeah i bet you can find it with the

691.279 --> 703.8389999999999
english

691.839 --> 703.839
subtitles if you like

708.56 --> 711.68
how is nathan spending on a pc i don't

710.8 --> 714.639
know youtube

711.68 --> 716.8
he had a lot of surplus so if there's a

714.639 --> 718.399
new problem he will absolutely be able

716.8 --> 721.68
to fix it no doubt

718.399 --> 721.68
still has the surplus

728.32 --> 731.519
you know maybe even like free is

729.92 --> 734.0
freaking motherboard gave out or

731.519 --> 735.76
something you know

734.0 --> 737.839
that's often a problem when you have a

735.76 --> 740.24
pc

737.839 --> 742.24
and like certain things about it break

740.24 --> 743.12
after a long time like after five years

742.24 --> 745.12
or something

743.12 --> 746.88
and you get new parts they are like

745.12 --> 748.079
updated and they tend to draw more

746.88 --> 749.8389999999999
energy in that [ __ ]

748.079 --> 751.8389999999999
and i've experienced this myself trying

749.839 --> 752.24
to update slightly older motherboards

751.839 --> 753.7600000000001
that

752.24 --> 755.76
at some point they would give out

753.76 --> 756.72
because of that so that could be the

755.76 --> 759.68
situation

756.72 --> 760.48
i don't know man you never really know

759.68 --> 762.88
until

760.48 --> 765.04
nathan just shares with us what's going

762.88 --> 765.04
on

766.079 --> 786.88
anyway i hope he's going live now today

772.639 --> 790.0790000000001
so where is everybody in chat gone now

786.88 --> 792.88
yeah i bumped into me

790.079 --> 795.92
at netflix so i think that anybody could

792.88 --> 795.92
pretty much watch that

796.24 --> 801.839
unless it's now just going away

803.12 --> 815.839
internet connection is still working yes

822.519 --> 829.33
electromagnetism what about it

825.44 --> 833.45
good servant

829.33 --> 833.45
[Music]

840.839 --> 843.839
there

846.959 --> 855.5999999999999
explain it to me what explain what

851.199 --> 855.5999999999999
what electromagnetism is how that works

855.68 --> 859.8389999999999
i was thought that the explanation of

858.48 --> 863.279
dielectrics

859.839 --> 864.5600000000001
concerning magnetism is pretty spot-on

863.279 --> 868.16
that it's like this

864.56 --> 868.16
dual state of electricity

869.279 --> 871.8389999999999
you know

874.079 --> 878.16
yeah that's not much of an explanation

875.76 --> 879.8389999999999
because it's not my expertise to explain

878.16 --> 882.3199999999999
that there's other people out there that

879.839 --> 884.48
love explaining it and then drawing all

882.32 --> 886.1600000000001
kinds of things into it and whatever the

884.48 --> 888.72
ether

886.16 --> 889.399
i don't do that but as for like hey what

888.72 --> 893.12
is

889.399 --> 895.199
electromagnetism well yeah

893.12 --> 898.16
it does seem to tie in very directly

895.199 --> 901.199
with electricity

898.16 --> 903.199
like even magnets you could

901.199 --> 906.399
consider that they might actually just

903.199 --> 910.0
be tapping slight energy out

906.399 --> 915.04
of the air that's just there in some way

910.0 --> 918.16
i don't know again it's not my expertise

915.04 --> 920.0
i understand the shapes and visuals with

918.16 --> 922.16
magnetism a lot

920.0 --> 923.04
just like if you be if you're confronted

922.16 --> 924.959
enough eventually

923.04 --> 927.199
you just start to recognize what the

924.959 --> 930.7199999999999
pattern of it is

927.199 --> 934.079
but yeah the physics

930.72 --> 935.839
electric yeah physics concerning

934.079 --> 937.68
electrics

935.839 --> 940.9590000000001
i don't know for some reason i've never

937.68 --> 944.16
been great at that like even in school

940.959 --> 946.56
during physics there was like electrics

944.16 --> 949.519
switches and all that and for some

946.56 --> 952.16
reason i didn't like it

949.519 --> 955.839
i had trouble just getting my head

952.16 --> 955.8389999999999
straight with the symbols and [ __ ] and

960.959 --> 969.5189999999999
i don't know maybe maybe that'll change

966.079 --> 972.6389999999999
no i do know it is doable

969.519 --> 974.9590000000001
just never really uh no 10 wheelchairs

972.639 --> 974.9590000000001
this is

977.92 --> 983.8389999999999
alrighty dokey

987.04 --> 992.3199999999999
admiral is the english title of that

990.399 --> 996.16
movie

992.32 --> 998.48
what it's just called admiral

996.16 --> 998.48
really

1003.519 --> 1007.279
yeah i spotted that comment pretty late

1008.839 --> 1011.839
statsmart

1019.44 --> 1025.039
yeah michael jones i know i know yeah

1022.32 --> 1025.6000000000001
ken wheeler he's a bit of a blabber

1025.039 --> 1028.4
mouth

1025.6 --> 1030.0
and he likes the techno babble a lot i

1028.4 --> 1031.919
don't know it's like his juggling he

1030.0 --> 1032.559
likes attack no bubble i don't like that

1031.919 --> 1035.6000000000001
at all

1032.559 --> 1036.839
it's very confusing doesn't help you

1035.6 --> 1039.839
know

1036.839 --> 1039.839
uh

1039.919 --> 1044.64
but yeah he did he kind of seemed to be

1043.36 --> 1046.319
the first person that

1044.64 --> 1049.5200000000002
brought forth the dielectrics

1046.319 --> 1052.3999999999999
understanding concerning magnetism

1049.52 --> 1054.24
i think i don't know he brought that

1052.4 --> 1055.8400000000001
forth he discovered it maybe or he

1054.24 --> 1059.919
rediscovered it

1055.84 --> 1062.1599999999999
i don't know i just remember that

1059.919 --> 1066.24
he was kind of the guy that pushed that

1062.16 --> 1070.559
forward on youtube and he got his moment

1066.24 --> 1074.48
of fame for that yeah theor

1070.559 --> 1078.6399999999999
theo ria apophis is his

1074.48 --> 1078.64
youtube channel michael jones that's

1078.84 --> 1081.84
correct

1087.36 --> 1109.84
what the right

1095.12 --> 1109.84
right yeah

1117.2 --> 1120.289
[Music]

1120.84 --> 1128.009
hmm

1123.32 --> 1128.009
[Music]

1142.82 --> 1145.8999999999999
[Music]

1150.0 --> 1153.52
right anyway let's move on

1155.2 --> 1161.0
i don't have much to say about it

1157.79 --> 1161.0
[Music]

1162.84 --> 1166.6399999999999
uh

1164.559 --> 1169.52
you know if you want to watch that then

1166.64 --> 1179.8400000000001
just watch videos from him you know

1169.52 --> 1179.84
does it all the time

1202.24 --> 1204.559
right

1205.76 --> 1210.48
anything else another subject perhaps

1210.799 --> 1214.32
something that's more down my lane

1215.28 --> 1220.0
oh right yeah and maybe there's a tidbit

1217.84 --> 1222.32
that was just thinking about

1220.0 --> 1222.32
you know

1223.039 --> 1226.48
i just realized that

1228.96 --> 1232.0
like cognitively you know because i've

1231.36 --> 1234.8799999999999
already

1232.0 --> 1235.679
conceptually compartmentalize the things

1234.88 --> 1239.6000000000001
but

1235.679 --> 1243.52
that daylight it was created differently

1239.6 --> 1246.32
from sunlight from the sun luminary

1243.52 --> 1248.72
and it's light that it does give and i'm

1246.32 --> 1251.84
just realizing that yes

1248.72 --> 1257.2
daylight is actually light

1251.84 --> 1257.1999999999998
it does it is light it's not

1257.6 --> 1262.08
the sun because the sun can be covered

1260.799 --> 1264.4
and there's still daylight

1262.08 --> 1266.32
hitting you and this idea and this was

1264.4 --> 1267.6000000000001
originally implanted in me by

1266.32 --> 1269.84
the same people that brought this

1267.6 --> 1273.28
heliocentric model is that

1269.84 --> 1275.6
the sun just refracts onto everything

1273.28 --> 1276.32
just it's so bright it's just go yeah

1275.6 --> 1278.24
it's

1276.32 --> 1280.3999999999999
going all over the place all over the

1278.24 --> 1283.84
atmosphere

1280.4 --> 1284.48
the first half or something and that's

1283.84 --> 1287.4399999999998
how it just

1284.48 --> 1289.28
refracts around into the daylight that

1287.44 --> 1292.159
makes no sense

1289.28 --> 1293.12
makes no physical sense and i think that

1292.159 --> 1296.4
it is really

1293.12 --> 1298.2399999999998
a separate light you know

1296.4 --> 1300.0
if you do look during the day and there

1298.24 --> 1302.88
is a shadow from the sun

1300.0 --> 1305.52
that's visible and one spot it casts a

1302.88 --> 1308.4
shadow right

1305.52 --> 1310.32
but in that shadow you can still see

1308.4 --> 1314.24
it's not pitch black

1310.32 --> 1318.799
because there's daylight also

1314.24 --> 1321.919
generically coming from

1318.799 --> 1323.039
all directions you could also probably

1321.919 --> 1324.88
block

1323.039 --> 1326.24
that daylight separately it might be

1324.88 --> 1329.8400000000001
interesting to even

1326.24 --> 1333.76
figure out if i could demonstrate this

1329.84 --> 1335.6
you know because yeah you take a pole

1333.76 --> 1337.2
or like a chimney because it was over

1335.6 --> 1339.4399999999998
there that i realized it like a chimney

1337.2 --> 1341.52
it casts a shadow if the sun hits if

1339.44 --> 1343.6000000000001
if the blue sky sun hits it from the

1341.52 --> 1345.44
side casts a shadow

1343.6 --> 1347.28
they're still visible you can st i could

1345.44 --> 1348.799
still see all the rocks

1347.28 --> 1350.96
different colors in there which means

1348.799 --> 1352.6399999999999
that still light hitting it

1350.96 --> 1354.24
that's definitely not from the sun

1352.64 --> 1357.44
because it's giving off

1354.24 --> 1360.24
shadow like that over that spot so

1357.44 --> 1362.799
if i would then take it like a very low

1360.24 --> 1366.4
down table

1362.799 --> 1367.039
that's pretty wide and make sure it's

1366.4 --> 1368.96
not trans

1367.039 --> 1371.2
has a non-transparent top put it over

1368.96 --> 1374.559
that i bet you that

1371.2 --> 1378.0
if i could film it you would see that

1374.559 --> 1379.76
in the shadow you would still see

1378.0 --> 1383.2
something because of daylight but

1379.76 --> 1385.039
directly under the top in on yeah in

1383.2 --> 1388.559
this shadow spot

1385.039 --> 1389.52
it would be a lot darker because the

1388.559 --> 1393.44
daylight there

1389.52 --> 1393.44
for the most part is also being blocked

1395.76 --> 1401.28
indirectly yeah i just said that

1399.2 --> 1402.88
indirectly there's no proof for that at

1401.28 --> 1404.3999999999999
all

1402.88 --> 1406.7990000000002
doesn't make any sense that there would

1404.4 --> 1409.76
be a straight beam

1406.799 --> 1411.9189999999999
coming from this from the sun position

1409.76 --> 1415.84
from the sun angle

1411.919 --> 1419.44
making distinct distinct shadows

1415.84 --> 1422.24
very distinct and then at the same time

1419.44 --> 1425.679
cascading from all directions

1422.24 --> 1425.679
that that makes no sense

1428.0 --> 1433.6
so yeah a just so explanation

1431.039 --> 1435.36
is very simple yeah but it still doesn't

1433.6 --> 1437.039
make any sense and there's no proof for

1435.36 --> 1440.4799999999998
that

1437.039 --> 1440.48
from surrounding items no

1442.84 --> 1449.4399999999998
no yeah there may be

1445.84 --> 1452.0
reflections going on

1449.44 --> 1452.88
but in that shadow yeah something can

1452.0 --> 1454.88
reflect even

1452.88 --> 1457.2
over the top of that shadow and then add

1454.88 --> 1459.1200000000001
some sunlight after all you know

1457.2 --> 1460.88
but that's not what i saw there was

1459.12 --> 1465.12
nothing reflecting

1460.88 --> 1468.72
sunlight onto that spot it was daylight

1465.12 --> 1468.7199999999998
it's very different type of light

1470.72 --> 1477.84
very different daylight is like

1474.0 --> 1482.08
it's woozy fluffy light

1477.84 --> 1485.279
it's just very all directions and

1482.08 --> 1489.36
it's completely different from sunlight

1485.279 --> 1489.36
from direct sunlight very different

1499.44 --> 1503.76
particles in the air reflect

1505.13 --> 1510.159
[Music]

1507.36 --> 1512.4799999999998
but no not necessarily if there's a

1510.159 --> 1514.4
cloud in front of the sun

1512.48 --> 1516.48
that's really blocking it yeah there's

1514.4 --> 1516.96
going to know be no more sunlight

1516.48 --> 1519.44
hitting

1516.96 --> 1521.76
the ground but there's still there's

1519.44 --> 1524.559
even if there is clouds

1521.76 --> 1526.4
there's still just this generic light

1524.559 --> 1529.36
coming from all directions with

1526.4 --> 1532.0
clouds it's less with the blue sky it's

1529.36 --> 1532.0
a little more

1532.4 --> 1538.88
the sky is

1536.88 --> 1540.7990000000002
technically transparent air is

1538.88 --> 1542.0800000000002
transparent it doesn't have a color even

1540.799 --> 1545.76
if there's huge quantities

1542.08 --> 1545.76
of it you know

1546.96 --> 1552.32
so how

1550.08 --> 1555.039
yeah that doesn't make any sense like if

1552.32 --> 1558.08
it's like scattering reflecting

1555.039 --> 1559.76
sunlight after you would see it it

1558.08 --> 1563.9189999999999
wouldn't look

1559.76 --> 1565.84
just like fluffy light coming from all

1563.919 --> 1568.88
directions

1565.84 --> 1571.039
it makes no sense

1568.88 --> 1574.48
diffuse the sun oh yeah it does block

1571.039 --> 1574.48
the sun because you have a shadow

1575.279 --> 1579.36
so tiny wumbo it's just not true

1579.84 --> 1585.84
clouds cast shadows

1595.19 --> 1598.239
[Music]

1606.159 --> 1610.8400000000001
not all clouds are the same i'm pretty

1608.08 --> 1615.1999999999998
sure they are mostly just

1610.84 --> 1618.3999999999999
watcher that's what clouds are

1615.2 --> 1621.3600000000001
maybe some dust ah

1618.4 --> 1624.8400000000001
if there's dust then it's gonna rain out

1621.36 --> 1627.84
so it's it's non-dusted

1624.84 --> 1627.84
water

1637.2 --> 1643.279
what are clouds i don't know

1641.679 --> 1645.3600000000001
how could you explain it they're

1643.279 --> 1649.679
basically

1645.36 --> 1653.1999999999998
water trapped in between the water vapor

1649.679 --> 1657.44
and the uh

1653.2 --> 1661.1200000000001
yeah liquid water transition state

1657.44 --> 1663.52
so yeah in their vapor state they

1661.12 --> 1665.039
go up higher but they meet a certain

1663.52 --> 1668.08
critical temperature

1665.039 --> 1673.279
and then they turn to moist again

1668.08 --> 1673.279
and but yeah it kind of hangs in between

1674.0 --> 1683.84
well it is technically moist but for

1676.48 --> 1683.84
some reason it keeps hanging around

1690.72 --> 1694.88
in a way it does make sense because if

1692.48 --> 1697.279
the air is very cold up there

1694.88 --> 1699.7600000000002
then just like an ink stain in cold

1697.279 --> 1702.48
water doesn't dissolve very quickly

1699.76 --> 1706.559
and it doesn't in heat and hot water

1702.48 --> 1706.559
then so do the clouds kind of like

1707.2 --> 1714.159
not disperse as easily because it is

1710.96 --> 1717.3600000000001
cold up there even if the

1714.159 --> 1717.3600000000001
if it's pretty hot day

1719.679 --> 1723.76
why do clouds stay in their position

1721.76 --> 1725.84
well

1723.76 --> 1726.96
if first off because the earth is not a

1725.84 --> 1728.9599999999998
spinning globe

1726.96 --> 1731.52
so it's not going to be subjected by air

1728.96 --> 1734.559
displacement

1731.52 --> 1736.32
and yeah

1734.559 --> 1738.08
the second reason because of what i just

1736.32 --> 1741.2
said because it isn't cold

1738.08 --> 1743.52
it's in very cold air up there and

1741.2 --> 1744.88
just like an ink stain doesn't disperse

1743.52 --> 1747.52
very quickly

1744.88 --> 1748.88
in cold water so does a cloud not

1747.52 --> 1753.84
disperse

1748.88 --> 1753.8400000000001
very easily in very cold air up there

1754.32 --> 1758.48
oh yeah thank you julio pepin for the

1756.399 --> 1759.6
five dollar super chat donation paypal

1758.48 --> 1767.84
is working

1759.6 --> 1767.84
really okay let me check that out

1774.159 --> 1784.3990000000001
oh holy thank you very much

1779.36 --> 1784.399
that's gonna be extremely helpful

1785.52 --> 1794.96
yes thank you

1789.12 --> 1799.9189999999999
so much

1794.96 --> 1799.919
nice yeah that's that's gonna help a lot

1802.0 --> 1809.84
great support so

1805.36 --> 1809.84
yeah clouds what are they

1811.279 --> 1817.039
water vapor in a war in a hot state when

1814.48 --> 1819.679
it cools down it becomes droplets again

1817.039 --> 1824.48
it becomes liquid again

1819.679 --> 1824.48
but i don't know maybe the the droplets

1825.919 --> 1832.159
why do they stay up is it like something

1829.6 --> 1834.08
is it that the warm air keep moving that

1832.159 --> 1837.7600000000002
keeps moving up that kind of

1834.08 --> 1840.0
keeps it afloat

1837.76 --> 1841.2
i don't know you would have to you would

1840.0 --> 1844.32
have to ask a

1841.2 --> 1847.2
a meteorologist for this specific

1844.32 --> 1849.6789999999999
i think a meteorologist once told me but

1847.2 --> 1853.279
that's been a long time ago

1849.679 --> 1853.279
like 30 years or something

1854.96 --> 1859.3600000000001
and yeah besides that with meteorology

1857.919 --> 1861.3600000000001
it is kind of an issue because you're

1859.36 --> 1863.36
not entirely certain of course

1861.36 --> 1864.8799999999999
the meteorology institutes are

1863.36 --> 1868.32
completely honest with us

1864.88 --> 1871.0390000000002
at this point see so

1868.32 --> 1872.48
was that story partially a just so story

1871.039 --> 1874.72
that i got to hear

1872.48 --> 1879.84
about the clouds and why they floated i

1874.72 --> 1879.84
don't know for sure

1881.36 --> 1885.6789999999999
all right well tiny wumble look relative

1884.64 --> 1889.279
density

1885.679 --> 1890.96
okay dictates yeah yeah

1889.279 --> 1893.44
it's all about the relative density

1890.96 --> 1895.919
dictates that a droplet

1893.44 --> 1897.919
as in water in liquid form is a lot

1895.919 --> 1900.0
denser than any kind of air that's up

1897.919 --> 1903.2
there

1900.0 --> 1907.12
right so

1903.2 --> 1909.44
how come it doesn't just fall down

1907.12 --> 1911.12
it's odd it might have something to do

1909.44 --> 1913.3600000000001
with electrostatics

1911.12 --> 1914.32
because what i do know or what i was

1913.36 --> 1919.4399999999998
taught

1914.32 --> 1922.8799999999999
is that it requires a dust particle

1919.44 --> 1926.48
basically some kind of sand

1922.88 --> 1930.159
yeah dust very fine dust or anything

1926.48 --> 1933.279
so that it latches on to that

1930.159 --> 1935.0390000000002
and then it becomes heavy enough to fall

1933.279 --> 1937.12
down or something

1935.039 --> 1938.8799999999999
but i also heard even back then that it

1937.12 --> 1940.799
had to do with like electrostatic

1938.88 --> 1943.7600000000002
charges and all that

1940.799 --> 1945.519
and that just like what didn't

1943.76 --> 1949.12
understand it back then a lot

1945.519 --> 1950.88
not too great at it today even but so

1949.12 --> 1952.559
yeah i think elektra's natural

1950.88 --> 1953.7600000000002
electrostatics may also have an

1952.559 --> 1957.9189999999999
influence

1953.76 --> 1960.96
in keeping the liquid water

1957.919 --> 1964.159
which is way so visible like that

1960.96 --> 1964.159
how it keeps it up there

1969.84 --> 1976.399
yeah and now that i think of it

1973.6 --> 1977.279
it must be that you know why because

1976.399 --> 1980.559
even

1977.279 --> 1986.88
in extreme winter situations

1980.559 --> 1986.8799999999999
winter clouds can still hang up there

1988.88 --> 1994.72
see and if it's so cold

1992.159 --> 1996.5590000000002
that yeah there's like snow everywhere

1994.72 --> 1997.3600000000001
all the sunlight is gonna reflect it's

1996.559 --> 2000.6399999999999
not gonna

1997.36 --> 2001.12
get absorbed ground level as much but

2000.64 --> 2004.72
still

2001.12 --> 2007.9189999999999
clouds will hang way high up there

2004.72 --> 2011.1200000000001
yeah that makes no sense

2007.919 --> 2014.72
that yeah if there was no other

2011.12 --> 2019.84
influence than just relative density and

2014.72 --> 2019.84
the cycle of the state of water

2023.919 --> 2030.64
yeah indeed

2027.6 --> 2030.9599999999998
and with smoke i guess it it counts too

2030.64 --> 2034.5590000000002
like

2030.96 --> 2036.88
how does it hang up there and those are

2034.559 --> 2038.24
dust particles or carbon carbon

2036.88 --> 2040.24
particles

2038.24 --> 2041.84
so i think there probably is some

2040.24 --> 2044.799
electrostatics

2041.84 --> 2047.84
going on that has an influence on small

2044.799 --> 2047.84
particles up there

2049.359 --> 2061.7599999999998
that keep them just from falling down

2060.0 --> 2063.2
on the other hand yeah well with ashes

2061.76 --> 2066.48
and all that [ __ ] it

2063.2 --> 2067.2799999999997
it is very it always does happen that it

2066.48 --> 2069.04
does

2067.28 --> 2070.5600000000004
slowly fall down and then it's kind of

2069.04 --> 2074.0
like the

2070.56 --> 2076.639
the small mass the small

2074.0 --> 2077.52
yeah the size of the dust particle that

2076.639 --> 2080.0
it'll call it

2077.52 --> 2081.2
cause it to fall very slowly through the

2080.0 --> 2084.32
air

2081.2 --> 2087.5989999999997
because yeah its body

2084.32 --> 2089.3590000000004
has is very light compared to the amount

2087.599 --> 2092.32
of friction of the air is going to fall

2089.359 --> 2096.56
through so it's going to just dwell

2092.32 --> 2099.44
very very slowly compared to a more

2096.56 --> 2100.4
pronounced object of the same mass or

2099.44 --> 2103.76
yeah

2100.4 --> 2105.76
exactly the same density because there

2103.76 --> 2107.28
is the air friction that also determines

2105.76 --> 2111.28
the terminal velocity

2107.28 --> 2111.28
of an object in a medium

2112.88 --> 2118.96
but with clouds do they fall down

2116.32 --> 2118.96
slowly

2120.56 --> 2124.56
let me think about this again carefully

2124.8 --> 2129.2000000000003
right so it could be that clouds do

2128.24 --> 2131.839
indeed

2129.2 --> 2133.04
kind of fall down but like as they fall

2131.839 --> 2136.0789999999997
down

2133.04 --> 2140.24
the bottom part simply becomes water

2136.079 --> 2143.3590000000004
vapor again because it enters the

2140.24 --> 2146.3199999999997
the warmer air so maybe

2143.359 --> 2147.359
it kind of like cycles like a cloud

2146.32 --> 2151.44
could be simply

2147.359 --> 2151.44
cycling you know when there's like uh

2151.52 --> 2155.2
periodic shots like you take a shot

2153.44 --> 2156.64
every 10 minutes or something off clouds

2155.2 --> 2161.04
you do kind of see it like

2156.64 --> 2164.7999999999997
bur burling like it is not just

2161.04 --> 2168.32
like a a ball of fluff that just stays

2164.8 --> 2169.52
unmo yeah and motioning so maybe this is

2168.32 --> 2172.4
what's happening maybe

2169.52 --> 2174.48
density relative density does apply to

2172.4 --> 2177.119
the water droplets and they just

2174.48 --> 2179.28
kind of they're so small that they just

2177.119 --> 2181.28
slowly drift down

2179.28 --> 2184.1600000000003
so the whole cloud will technically

2181.28 --> 2187.52
drift down but the bottom part is always

2184.16 --> 2191.359
re evaporating because it's

2187.52 --> 2195.359
entering the warmer part as i guess

2191.359 --> 2197.92
new water vapor

2195.359 --> 2199.839
rises higher up and then start turns

2197.92 --> 2202.88
into moist again because it he

2199.839 --> 2206.16
hits the colder air front above

2202.88 --> 2207.6800000000003
yes i think this is how it works i think

2206.16 --> 2209.2
that's it

2207.68 --> 2215.839
i don't know why it took so long for me

2209.2 --> 2215.839
to remember that more clearly

2218.16 --> 2225.359
yeah glad i got it out there suddenly i

2221.599 --> 2225.3590000000004
just woke up like that i don't know why

2226.72 --> 2229.7999999999997
[Music]

2230.16 --> 2234.16
ah it seems nathan has opened a panel so

2233.76 --> 2243.8390000000004
he

2234.16 --> 2243.839
is having a live show that's good

2259.68 --> 2264.3199999999997
right george stanford you guys thought

2262.32 --> 2271.839
it made sense

2264.32 --> 2271.839
the the end explanation i get

2278.079 --> 2283.8390000000004
ah django freeman yeah

2282.16 --> 2286.96
yeah that's hey welcome to the

2283.839 --> 2286.96
holographic nature

2287.04 --> 2290.96
of the heavenly bodies it's a good one

2290.4 --> 2293.119
yeah it

2290.96 --> 2294.96
it works with the sun too you know sun

2293.119 --> 2296.7200000000003
go coming through the clouds you see all

2294.96 --> 2298.96
these beams you can even

2296.72 --> 2300.48
i don't know it's some i've i've

2298.96 --> 2302.88
experienced that

2300.48 --> 2304.0
where like sun beams would be like right

2302.88 --> 2306.079
in front of my feet

2304.0 --> 2308.8
and i could stand into them and like

2306.079 --> 2312.1600000000003
bask in this ray of light

2308.8 --> 2315.52
but hey if somebody else standing

2312.16 --> 2319.1189999999997
way on another location like a

2315.52 --> 2321.28
half a mile away even and there may be a

2319.119 --> 2323.04
little bit higher up so they can have me

2321.28 --> 2326.88
in their view without any bottoms up

2323.04 --> 2329.52
obstruction they could see me

2326.88 --> 2330.48
there but they will not see those light

2329.52 --> 2333.359
beams

2330.48 --> 2334.64
that i see right in front of me right

2333.359 --> 2337.04
next to me because

2334.64 --> 2339.359
to that person the sun is in another

2337.04 --> 2341.92
angular location

2339.359 --> 2343.7599999999998
and hey at that angular spot in relation

2341.92 --> 2345.6800000000003
to them there might not be that cloud in

2343.76 --> 2347.92
between

2345.68 --> 2351.44
or the cloud is more thick at that part

2347.92 --> 2355.04
so there's no beams going through it

2351.44 --> 2357.119
even though yeah in my location it does

2355.04 --> 2358.48
because it's all holographic it's so

2357.119 --> 2368.32
personal it's very

2358.48 --> 2372.2400000000002
weird like that

2368.32 --> 2374.2400000000002
on the globe little seeking star water

2372.24 --> 2376.0789999999997
uh yeah on a globe the phenomena i don't

2374.24 --> 2378.3199999999997
know it doesn't even have to do with the

2376.079 --> 2380.48
orientation of the earth the geometry of

2378.32 --> 2382.32
the presupposed geometry no no

2380.48 --> 2383.68
it's more about the heavenly bodies and

2382.32 --> 2387.04
the sun like

2383.68 --> 2388.64
hey it's not an object object that casts

2387.04 --> 2392.8
light doesn't work like that

2388.64 --> 2392.7999999999997
ever it doesn't

2392.88 --> 2400.32
so yeah it's like a holographic

2397.599 --> 2400.32
phenomenon

2401.44 --> 2405.44
the sun apparition and even the rest of

2403.92 --> 2408.96
it

2405.44 --> 2411.76
it's personal you see it

2408.96 --> 2413.2
uniquely and all the light effects

2411.76 --> 2416.0
deriving there from

2413.2 --> 2417.5989999999997
are observed by you uniquely from your

2416.0 --> 2420.88
position

2417.599 --> 2421.28
others cannot see the same things the

2420.88 --> 2424.6400000000003
same

2421.28 --> 2428.1600000000003
side effects exactly like you do

2424.64 --> 2430.56
because to them all the holographic

2428.16 --> 2432.96
bodies up there all the luminaries are

2430.56 --> 2434.88
arranged in a different way

2432.96 --> 2437.359
because they are in a slightly different

2434.88 --> 2439.839
location

2437.359 --> 2439.839
see

2479.52 --> 2483.44
yeah thanks for the good question django

2481.52 --> 2487.04
freeman i appreciate that

2483.44 --> 2488.93
good questions are very valuable to me

2487.04 --> 2490.319
and yeah it'll it'll help me

2488.93 --> 2493.1189999999997
[Music]

2490.319 --> 2494.24
remind people of just this weird

2493.119 --> 2497.1600000000003
supporting

2494.24 --> 2498.9599999999996
detail for my yeah holographic

2497.16 --> 2499.7599999999998
conceptualization of the globe of the

2498.96 --> 2502.0
heavens

2499.76 --> 2504.1600000000003
my conceptualization the lead that i'm

2502.0 --> 2506.839
on to as to what it really is

2504.16 --> 2508.0789999999997
non-physical holographic purely light

2506.839 --> 2510.72
based

2508.079 --> 2512.7200000000003
and yeah unique in relation to the

2510.72 --> 2516.48
observer

2512.72 --> 2518.3999999999996
which is why i typically presume that it

2516.48 --> 2521.2
is holographic because

2518.4 --> 2523.04
holographics is the only thing that does

2521.2 --> 2525.2799999999997
that sort of thing

2523.04 --> 2526.72
that i can conceive of that i can

2525.28 --> 2530.0
remember

2526.72 --> 2530.64
so yeah i'm just going bit with by what

2530.0 --> 2534.4
i've

2530.64 --> 2535.52
what i've experienced and then hope that

2534.4 --> 2539.839
i'll find

2535.52 --> 2543.2
more solid proof in some way

2539.839 --> 2545.599
or if not model it

2543.2 --> 2547.68
make a model and then not have

2545.599 --> 2548.88
scientific proof but still have a model

2547.68 --> 2552.48
for it

2548.88 --> 2553.92
i can already describe it so far

2552.48 --> 2557.44
that's how i've been explaining

2553.92 --> 2557.44
everything about it

2558.56 --> 2565.839
right but this this idea that

2568.48 --> 2576.839
that the sun or that the daylight is

2571.599 --> 2578.079
scattered sunlight that just makes no

2576.839 --> 2581.52
sense

2578.079 --> 2584.1600000000003
you know also by the way because

2581.52 --> 2585.92
way before the sun is even visible in

2584.16 --> 2588.96
the early morning

2585.92 --> 2591.76
daylight arrives and like

2588.96 --> 2592.2400000000002
it's it arrives pretty vividly enough to

2591.76 --> 2594.96
cast

2592.24 --> 2596.3999999999996
shadows again from objects if you like

2594.96 --> 2598.0
put it

2596.4 --> 2599.76
over the ground there's going to be

2598.0 --> 2603.119
thicker much

2599.76 --> 2603.119
thicker shadow in between

2603.359 --> 2607.839
right and there's no sun inside

2618.72 --> 2624.0
and then not call it a model well i'm

2621.839 --> 2624.7999999999997
not gonna call it a scientific model or

2624.0 --> 2627.65
something is

2624.8 --> 2629.119
ridiculous like that

2627.65 --> 2632.079
[Music]

2629.119 --> 2632.56
hey but look if there is no other way to

2632.079 --> 2636.48
even

2632.56 --> 2638.0
try to explain it then yeah a model is

2636.48 --> 2641.359
the best i got

2638.0 --> 2642.64
you know as long as it at least

2641.359 --> 2645.2
correlates

2642.64 --> 2646.64
with observations that people can test

2645.2 --> 2650.64
for themselves

2646.64 --> 2653.2
you know i'm not asking to reify

2650.64 --> 2654.4
anything in in a direct sense it's only

2653.2 --> 2659.2
like

2654.4 --> 2659.2000000000003
based on observations

2659.76 --> 2663.8390000000004
and correlations

2664.079 --> 2667.8390000000004
but hey again if there's some there i

2666.16 --> 2671.2799999999997
haven't found anything blatantly

2667.839 --> 2671.2799999999997
contradicting about it yet

2675.68 --> 2679.04
like observations that just completely

2678.079 --> 2682.079
outdo the

2679.04 --> 2684.24
entire concept like oh somebody actually

2682.079 --> 2684.8
did video how they approached the sun

2684.24 --> 2689.1189999999997
yeah that

2684.8 --> 2692.6400000000003
okay then yeah

2689.119 --> 2692.6400000000003
that would be a whole different matter

2693.28 --> 2697.3590000000004
but yeah there's no such thing so far

2697.68 --> 2702.319
like the biggest clue that there is even

2700.24 --> 2704.7999999999997
potential for such a thing is that one

2702.319 --> 2707.92
video and i don't know who made that

2704.8 --> 2710.6400000000003
that i saw even a long time ago

2707.92 --> 2712.8
in the early days of flat earth with

2710.64 --> 2715.44
this super high altitude balloon was it

2712.8 --> 2715.44
dog cam

2716.64 --> 2719.92
no no was another one i think i'm not

2718.4 --> 2722.64
sure where it

2719.92 --> 2723.92
seemed like the sun was a pretty damn

2722.64 --> 2727.7599999999998
big

2723.92 --> 2727.76
fiery or light ball

2727.839 --> 2732.56
hitting this weird and now retrospect

2730.839 --> 2734.7999999999997
holographic

2732.56 --> 2735.599
beam of light on the ground and the

2734.8 --> 2738.8
clouds

2735.599 --> 2741.28
very very deep below

2738.8 --> 2742.88
right well that beam i can guarantee you

2741.28 --> 2744.0
that the people there on the ground if

2742.88 --> 2748.48
there are any

2744.0 --> 2752.56
did not see a giant beam like that

2748.48 --> 2752.56
you know the spotlight

2753.599 --> 2758.8
you know when at what height do you

2755.44 --> 2761.119
start to see a spotlight from the sun

2758.8 --> 2763.8390000000004
because it was just that shot you didn't

2761.119 --> 2767.119
see it slow yeah from bottom

2763.839 --> 2768.7999999999997
from launch to up and then like oh whoa

2767.119 --> 2770.0
is that a spotlight that is sort of

2768.8 --> 2773.04
forming there

2770.0 --> 2773.52
no no it was just the shot to me it

2773.04 --> 2776.72
almost

2773.52 --> 2779.52
looked like it was in a giant box

2776.72 --> 2781.68
very odd video but it it definitely blew

2779.52 --> 2784.16
my mind

2781.68 --> 2785.9199999999996
and it did make it look very much like

2784.16 --> 2790.0789999999997
the sun was a ball that was

2785.92 --> 2790.079
floating over the flat earth

2790.8 --> 2794.6400000000003
but yeah there's just just that one

2792.64 --> 2798.319
video it's the only one

2794.64 --> 2800.48
that i've seen that was like sort of off

2798.319 --> 2802.8
and it's old i don't know even where it

2800.48 --> 2806.72
came from who made that

2802.8 --> 2809.2000000000003
it was like way in 2015 and 14

2806.72 --> 2811.2799999999997
and kind of saw it in my vision in 2012

2809.2 --> 2815.359
as well

2811.28 --> 2815.3590000000004
yeah whatever

2827.839 --> 2831.839
prison one

2832.4 --> 2842.0
curved lens around or near the sunlight

2836.079 --> 2842.0
really are you sure it's not just your

2842.839 --> 2845.839
eyes

2869.76 --> 2873.28
what are you talking about tiny wumbo

2871.599 --> 2876.0
what

2873.28 --> 2877.52
cnb if there's thing yeah but now again

2876.0 --> 2880.64
you're talking about

2877.52 --> 2883.119
physical confirmed physical light light

2880.64 --> 2887.839
that we can make

2883.119 --> 2887.839
by fire or electrics or chemistry or

2898.839 --> 2901.839
yeah

2902.64 --> 2905.7599999999998
all right django freeman

2907.92 --> 2915.839
it's funny so he's going after after the

2910.88 --> 2915.839
ballers as well

2925.04 --> 2931.599
yeah yeah eric the bay was always pretty

2928.319 --> 2934.88
decent in in his

2931.599 --> 2938.319
like hit piece videos on ballers

2934.88 --> 2940.88
i think because he does like he does

2938.319 --> 2943.839
do his homework you know he does do

2940.88 --> 2943.839
research and all that

2959.119 --> 2966.8
noble gases excited

2962.48 --> 2970.079
high in the atmo at the approaching sun

2966.8 --> 2972.1600000000003
what approaching are you stating that

2970.079 --> 2975.76
the sun is a physical object

2972.16 --> 2985.839
because that's what approach implies

2975.76 --> 2985.8390000000004
seeking star wars

2990.33 --> 2998.0789999999997
[Music]

2991.76 --> 2999.119
yeah that's right george sanford all

2998.079 --> 3013.8390000000004
right

2999.119 --> 3013.839
later tiny wumble

3025.44 --> 3029.839
right um

3037.599 --> 3045.2000000000003
getting kind of i haven't had anything

3041.839 --> 3048.48
this morning yet because i did get up

3045.2 --> 3049.04
pretty late because it was like three

3048.48 --> 3051.92
o'clock

3049.04 --> 3055.2
this is not good for me but yeah

3051.92 --> 3057.119
roommate kept me up

3055.2 --> 3058.96
and especially because if i get like

3057.119 --> 3061.839
pissed off

3058.96 --> 3062.7200000000003
after a certain point then then i stay

3061.839 --> 3069.839
awake

3062.72 --> 3069.839
because of that it just wakes me back up

3075.52 --> 3079.839
so how about that lava how the hell is

3077.68 --> 3083.839
that stuff made

3079.839 --> 3086.48
well i have a an older hangout

3083.839 --> 3086.88
on the flat earth talks about that and

3086.48 --> 3091.2
if you

3086.88 --> 3091.2000000000003
even upgraded speculation about it

3091.359 --> 3094.7999999999997
and it is very mysterious like they

3094.16 --> 3098.24
could be

3094.8 --> 3100.2400000000002
local pockets that might be

3098.24 --> 3101.359
through in yeah generated through

3100.24 --> 3105.5989999999997
induction

3101.359 --> 3108.96
or it might more be like their tubes

3105.599 --> 3112.4
created by friction if you would

3108.96 --> 3115.839
yeah step away from the imagination

3112.4 --> 3116.7200000000003
of the molten iron core and the tectonic

3115.839 --> 3119.04
plates

3116.72 --> 3120.0
yeah sitting on top of that floating on

3119.04 --> 3123.2
top of it

3120.0 --> 3124.0
and maybe conceptualize the the earth of

3123.2 --> 3128.48
the realm to

3124.0 --> 3130.079
be more like pillars

3128.48 --> 3131.52
that are just sitting next to one

3130.079 --> 3134.8
another but that do

3131.52 --> 3136.64
move around we have motion and yeah if

3134.8 --> 3138.8
there's basically

3136.64 --> 3140.8799999999997
loose things that and there is motion

3138.8 --> 3144.4
there's going to be friction now if this

3140.88 --> 3145.44
amount of friction is enough then there

3144.4 --> 3148.0
may be

3145.44 --> 3150.4
lava there so the lava may almost be

3148.0 --> 3150.4
like a

3150.48 --> 3155.359
yeah a liquid part that kind of keeps it

3155.599 --> 3159.119
like an oil it keeps it oiled maybe you

3157.92 --> 3161.2000000000003
know it's another way

3159.119 --> 3163.359
another conceptualization to approach it

3161.2 --> 3165.7599999999998
but yeah overall lava

3163.359 --> 3168.319
whether it be simple pockets created

3165.76 --> 3170.8
locally by some extra yeah

3168.319 --> 3171.44
most engineering like electrical process

3170.8 --> 3174.4
that just

3171.44 --> 3176.48
happened to create that or whether it is

3174.4 --> 3180.2400000000002
part of some integral earthly

3176.48 --> 3182.079
side of yeah what the

3180.24 --> 3184.24
what the stone what the earth actually

3182.079 --> 3184.2400000000002
is

3184.319 --> 3195.839
but it's definitely not a molten iron

3186.0 --> 3195.839
core and i'm pretty sure about that

3206.16 --> 3223.839
don't you mean magma yeah yeah that's

3209.04 --> 3223.839
what i was talking about

3228.319 --> 3237.839
new land grows up through the cracks

3231.04 --> 3237.839
really does it

3240.24 --> 3246.16
oh lava at least is known that it's very

3243.52 --> 3246.16
fertile

3246.48 --> 3252.319
but i'm not sure exactly what it like

3249.68 --> 3254.24
how it is formed

3252.319 --> 3265.839
i've yeah conceptualized about it but

3254.24 --> 3265.839
i'm just not sure

3269.76 --> 3274.4
no seeking star wars hypnotizing that

3272.48 --> 3277.599
the sun causes a shadow also implies

3274.4 --> 3277.599
physicality no it doesn't

3277.68 --> 3281.68
physicality has different requirements

3280.559 --> 3285.3590000000004
light is not a

3281.68 --> 3288.0789999999997
inter yeah you can't derive anything

3285.359 --> 3289.7599999999998
specifically physical from it hey if you

3288.079 --> 3292.96
have confirmation

3289.76 --> 3295.6800000000003
like you have already confirmed the

3292.96 --> 3297.76
physicality of like a lamp or a lantern

3295.68 --> 3299.04
or something a physical object that

3297.76 --> 3303.28
gives light

3299.04 --> 3306.319
yeah sure sure then you can imply

3303.28 --> 3308.4
from the shadow that it is an

3306.319 --> 3310.0
object and you can even like move things

3308.4 --> 3311.92
and see how the shadow becomes bigger

3310.0 --> 3313.44
smaller write all these indications of

3311.92 --> 3317.2000000000003
physicality

3313.44 --> 3319.68
well the sun already discussed that

3317.2 --> 3320.72
has holographic elements so a beam of

3319.68 --> 3322.96
light from the sun

3320.72 --> 3323.9199999999996
coming through the clouds visible to one

3322.96 --> 3326.7200000000003
person may

3323.92 --> 3329.599
simply not be visible exactly like that

3326.72 --> 3334.16
to another person

3329.599 --> 3337.52
yeah so

3334.16 --> 3342.48
let's prove against

3337.52 --> 3342.48
a standard physical nature see

3346.24 --> 3350.16
so just shadows yeah

3350.24 --> 3355.4399999999996
what a shadow implies indirectly

3353.359 --> 3357.5989999999997
is a physical object there well in this

3355.44 --> 3360.2400000000002
case the physical object would be

3357.599 --> 3363.28
a chimney or a cloud or a tree that's

3360.24 --> 3366.24
the physical object you know the shadow

3363.28 --> 3368.48
yeah for physical shadow definitely

3366.24 --> 3370.799
physical object

3368.48 --> 3370.799
you know

3372.96 --> 3376.64
but that doesn't mean anything directly

3376.16 --> 3380.3999999999996
about

3376.64 --> 3385.359
any physical nature of the light source

3380.4 --> 3389.04
there's other ways to derive information

3385.359 --> 3391.359
like that even though yeah

3389.04 --> 3392.48
look we have lamps we have lanterns we

3391.359 --> 3394.72
have torches

3392.48 --> 3396.64
on earth for a very long time so yeah

3394.72 --> 3398.5589999999997
that's

3396.64 --> 3400.96
everybody's gonna learn about how that

3398.559 --> 3404.4
works before they probably get to

3400.96 --> 3406.799
think about the sun besides i don't know

3404.4 --> 3409.92
some religious approach or

3406.799 --> 3413.2
just knowing it's freaking hot

3409.92 --> 3415.2000000000003
right anyway i'm gonna run that show so

3413.2 --> 3416.5589999999997
thanks everyone for coming i hope you

3415.2 --> 3417.52
liked the show i thought it was pretty

3416.559 --> 3419.2000000000003
good

3417.52 --> 3421.359
if you liked it then please don't forget

3446.24 --> 3450.0
i'm gonna join the flat earth debates

3448.0 --> 3453.44
