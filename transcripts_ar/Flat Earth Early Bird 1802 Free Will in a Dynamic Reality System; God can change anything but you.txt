397.639 --> 403.16
all that the other show did like

400.84 --> 405.28
severely decrease the amount of views it

403.16 --> 408.03900000000004
got at the beginning but it seems all

405.28 --> 408.039
caught up by

424.94 --> 427.98
[Music]

435.0 --> 437.68
what's going on

446.0 --> 450.479
yesterday

447.56 --> 453.319
yeah yes so speaking easy news round

450.479 --> 453.31899999999996
eight that was

454.199 --> 461.84000000000003
fun and yeah I want now remember I

457.0 --> 461.84
watched this mind unveiled had a new

465.28 --> 471.08
video and this time they were like

467.56 --> 473.08
reviewing Eon flux the movie and the old

471.08 --> 476.71999999999997
animated series from

473.08 --> 479.35999999999996
MTV that old series from MTV always

476.72 --> 482.199
really creeped me out and I mean when

479.36 --> 485.56
because it was on TV back then every

482.199 --> 488.12
time I saw it like there were people

485.56 --> 490.44
like I think my brother and other people

488.12 --> 493.68
that were older they were like wow this

490.44 --> 496.08
is really good like this is really

493.68 --> 497.479
complicated but I was just like this is

496.08 --> 500.0
so [ __ ]

497.479 --> 504.039
creepy everything about it is so messed

500.0 --> 506.84
up and everybody's all demonic and

504.039 --> 509.919
[ __ ] it like really creeped me out so I

506.84 --> 512.76
never actually watched it properly

509.919 --> 514.88
was good to basically see a walk through

512.76 --> 517.8
review

514.88 --> 520.76
from uh mind and

517.8 --> 524.8
field was very

520.76 --> 527.88
interesting like that science fiction

524.8 --> 530.16
dystopian futuristic world is very

527.88 --> 533.16
detailed and in the movie that already

530.16 --> 535.24
comes forth I have the movie like the

533.16 --> 539.7199999999999
actual live acted

535.24 --> 541.16
movie on DVD even and even though I

539.72 --> 544.88
never really thought it was like the

541.16 --> 547.079
best movie ever like it was

544.88 --> 549.519
interesting there were very interesting

547.079 --> 549.519
things in

550.6 --> 557.519
it right but

553.839 --> 559.32
yeah the video he made was just very

557.519 --> 561.48
interesting I definitely

559.32 --> 564.0
recommend that to people that are

561.48 --> 564.0
interested

565.56 --> 569.7199999999999
in in

568.12 --> 573.9590000000001
like

569.72 --> 577.399
transhumanist F futurist Visions which

573.959 --> 580.04
this is definitely a part of like it is

577.399 --> 584.24
very high-end future it's like very far

580.04 --> 586.4399999999999
away type of future set up or basically

584.24 --> 588.399
it's already very far Advanced within

586.44 --> 591.7600000000001
the transhumanism and thought through

588.399 --> 594.72
very thoroughly also like issues like oh

591.76 --> 598.92
yeah your ancestral knowledge is lost

594.72 --> 602.64
and [ __ ] and like it's very serious

598.92 --> 606.88
really really if you can get into it

602.64 --> 606.88
right anyway interesting

614.56 --> 620.92
video hey o what what are you talking

617.48 --> 625.6800000000001
about clutch doons is not

620.92 --> 629.88
Oz just stop please stop digging up

625.68 --> 633.12
old old trolls that are kicked out

629.88 --> 635.72
just don't do that

633.12 --> 638.079
please leave duper alone I mean

635.72 --> 640.72
seriously why the [ __ ] is everybody in

638.079 --> 640.7199999999999
for freaking

642.92 --> 649.92
duper like what the [ __ ] damage is he

645.68 --> 652.079
even going to do like what is he gonna

649.92 --> 655.8
do oh

652.079 --> 659.959
Tommy oh right you think Tommy is duper

655.8 --> 663.519
okay fair enough could be

659.959 --> 663.5189999999999
is you know what I

665.519 --> 669.5600000000001
mean okay fair enough

672.92 --> 675.92
it's

676.36 --> 680.839
Tomy

678.8 --> 684.959
right

680.839 --> 688.399
duper I don't get it though like at QE

684.959 --> 692.88
at ball busters like everybody was in

688.399 --> 692.88
against you and like I don't get

697.92 --> 704.5999999999999
it I don't get what duper is doing so

701.48 --> 706.88
terribly wrong except that yes you have

704.6 --> 710.16
you do have a really stupid video

706.88 --> 714.079
uploaded sort of anti fed video I do

710.16 --> 714.079
agree like that video is

717.12 --> 723.76
ridiculous but I mean it's not really a

719.639 --> 727.519
troll video and it it barely makes a

723.76 --> 730.639
point so I don't get

727.519 --> 732.88
it I don't get why everybody isn't just

730.639 --> 735.01
ignoring him if there is's annoying oh

732.88 --> 738.09
hold

735.01 --> 738.09
[Music]

747.88 --> 750.88
on

829.279 --> 831.88
and I'm

837.759 --> 843.12
back

840.04 --> 845.759
a card game that a flatter that does not

843.12 --> 845.759
sound good

845.8 --> 850.8389999999999
noons by all

847.92 --> 852.88
means put it on paper or something and

850.839 --> 857.839
make a video about it right if you'd

852.88 --> 860.279
have that kind of video about your silly

857.839 --> 862.12
projects in that sense or maybe they're

860.279 --> 865.24
not so silly maybe they're really cool I

862.12 --> 868.12
don't know do that make a video about it

865.24 --> 872.88
and upload that instead of stupid anti

868.12 --> 878.519
fed videos duper how about

872.88 --> 881.88
that right just do it I used to make

878.519 --> 884.079
cards too sort of like when I was really

881.88 --> 887.68
into Magic the Gathering and everybody

884.079 --> 890.12
was we used to make up cards and then

887.68 --> 893.7199999999999
like design and draw them and then use

890.12 --> 897.6
them in Magic game for the fun of

893.72 --> 900.44
it so yeah why not you go make a card

897.6 --> 903.399
game that's cool Flat Earth versus Globe

900.44 --> 906.12
something you do that and you work it

903.399 --> 908.8
out and then you make a video of that on

906.12 --> 912.0
your channel and maybe people won't just

908.8 --> 912.0
see you as a troll

913.68 --> 917.0
then I don't

918.12 --> 924.04
know Illuminati card game

921.32 --> 926.5600000000001
right it's not really a playable game

924.04 --> 926.56
though

927.6 --> 930.9590000000001
clutch or

931.8 --> 938.3599999999999
barely I think it is a playable game but

934.319 --> 941.36
I mean it's not

938.36 --> 941.36
interesting

942.12 --> 948.89
H wrestling

945.79 --> 948.89
[Music]

957.6 --> 960.6
cards

964.48 --> 967.72
hey Richard G good to see

970.48 --> 975.3190000000001
you it's good to have you back with your

972.959 --> 975.319
old

975.56 --> 980.1199999999999
name I mean Expedition truth is cool and

978.6 --> 982.72
all

980.12 --> 984.72
but it's kind of

982.72 --> 988.3190000000001
generic sort

984.72 --> 991.0
of by now in this era in this era I mean

988.319 --> 995.399
in 2015 that would have been pretty damn

991.0 --> 995.399
original now it's like almost

996.319 --> 999.319
common

1000.12 --> 1006.839
huh four years on your R terod du woof

1004.72 --> 1009.279
yeah but you like hand pained every

1006.839 --> 1013.639
single picture seeking star

1009.279 --> 1013.639
water so that's not a surprise

1017.48 --> 1020.48
though

1026.88 --> 1032.72
right making a

1028.679 --> 1035.52
game you can technically do that pretty

1032.72 --> 1038.24
quickly if you want to make art for

1035.52 --> 1041.199
every single thing in the game that is

1038.24 --> 1041.199
what takes a lot of

1047.4 --> 1050.4
time

1053.919 --> 1059.72
Cricket card games of course you had te

1056.679 --> 1059.72
it of course you

1077.4 --> 1080.4
did

1094.6 --> 1100.6
man I was so full like when I went to

1097.88 --> 1105.919
bed like I took a shower I mean that's

1100.6 --> 1105.9189999999999
that should be quite clear by now from

1106.44 --> 1111.48
viewers but I got so cleared up after

1113.4 --> 1120.039
that sometimes it like at night I get

1116.919 --> 1121.76
like this waking dream state almost

1120.039 --> 1125.8799999999999
where I'm just starting to dream dream

1121.76 --> 1125.8799999999999
walking but then it goes so

1128.65 --> 1134.039
[Music]

1129.799 --> 1135.08
far I was like trying to figure out like

1134.039 --> 1138.4
like

1135.08 --> 1140.84
how how you could push things in the

1138.4 --> 1143.76
right direction like for my country on a

1140.84 --> 1145.84
very serious way like also keeping in

1143.76 --> 1148.919
mind that I don't really have the full

1145.84 --> 1152.0
oversight over how it really works so it

1148.919 --> 1153.5200000000002
is like what do you do in the face of

1152.0 --> 1155.24
trying to change things when you know

1153.52 --> 1157.799
they're a little bit more complicated

1155.24 --> 1159.6
then you can oversee that you don't have

1157.799 --> 1162.6
all the grip on the factors and like how

1159.6 --> 1164.7199999999998
is it going to respond so it's like a

1162.6 --> 1167.039
pretty detailed

1164.72 --> 1170.24
simulation and like that just happens in

1167.039 --> 1170.24
my mind

1174.08 --> 1180.559
it's like trying to estimate where the

1176.799 --> 1183.6399999999999
people will decide to move in response

1180.559 --> 1183.6399999999999
to something that's

1185.24 --> 1188.24
done

1190.6 --> 1196.7199999999998
complicated right because I am kind of

1192.88 --> 1196.72
really worried about my country many

1197.24 --> 1202.2
ways this government is just like we're

1200.84 --> 1203.8799999999999
calling it a govern they're not

1202.2 --> 1205.3600000000001
technically government but they keep

1203.88 --> 1208.0800000000002
governing

1205.36 --> 1209.3999999999999
anyway we're pretty much hijacked at

1208.08 --> 1212.6789999999999
this

1209.4 --> 1215.679
point right supposedly we could have

1212.679 --> 1219.0800000000002
well we had new election yeah oh we a

1215.679 --> 1220.96
party vast majority voters and like yeah

1219.08 --> 1223.96
nobody cooperates with them so it's

1220.96 --> 1223.96
literally like

1225.799 --> 1232.08
nothing the people that everybody hates

1229.559 --> 1235.08
that everybody voted on this party for

1232.08 --> 1238.36
to get them out is still in power

1235.08 --> 1241.4399999999998
because nobody will cooperate with the

1238.36 --> 1245.28
replacing party in order to replace the

1241.44 --> 1248.76
Old Guard yeah this could go on for a

1245.28 --> 1250.84
while yeah and while it does everything

1248.76 --> 1252.96
about the country is

1250.84 --> 1255.1999999999998
destroyed all the farmers are going to

1252.96 --> 1255.2
get

1256.08 --> 1260.36
ruined and in inflation is going to go

1259.24 --> 1263.919
to all

1260.36 --> 1266.76
hell or whatever that is like prices

1263.919 --> 1270.4
will stay high go even

1266.76 --> 1273.2
higher no peace will be made with

1270.4 --> 1276.3200000000002
Russia and it's just

1273.2 --> 1279.2
yeah there literally nothing we could do

1276.32 --> 1282.72
except like wake out of this

1279.2 --> 1284.32
civilization stup and like all rise up

1282.72 --> 1287.559
and just

1284.32 --> 1288.96
say we're going to now drag them and put

1287.559 --> 1292.96
them in a

1288.96 --> 1295.88
cage like unconditional like we don't

1292.96 --> 1298.2
care about what's supposed [ __ ]

1295.88 --> 1300.24
judicial thing or whatever like we are

1298.2 --> 1302.3600000000001
going to drag them and put them into a

1300.24 --> 1304.96
cage and not let them

1302.36 --> 1307.3999999999999
out and we don't care how that's

1304.96 --> 1308.679
supposed to work we're going to make

1307.4 --> 1312.159
sure that that

1308.679 --> 1314.5590000000002
happens like we're going to force

1312.159 --> 1317.48
that and

1314.559 --> 1319.6
then give everybody a bit of space and

1317.48 --> 1321.32
and also so oriented like hey how does

1319.6 --> 1324.799
this world actually

1321.32 --> 1325.8799999999999
work without these [ __ ] scumbags

1324.799 --> 1329.12
ruling

1325.88 --> 1331.48
us like is that doable do we actually

1329.12 --> 1333.76
get a room or or will we find ourselves

1331.48 --> 1336.159
to get immediately crushed because

1333.76 --> 1338.48
everything is in a free fall and as soon

1336.159 --> 1341.6000000000001
as you try to escape from it you

1338.48 --> 1342.72
immediately get crushed I don't know how

1341.6 --> 1344.6789999999999
it

1342.72 --> 1347.2
is not

1344.679 --> 1349.5590000000002
really can't really assume that it's

1347.2 --> 1354.64
always going to be Doom but I mean the

1349.559 --> 1354.6399999999999
situation overall is pretty bad right

1358.08 --> 1362.4399999999998
anyway imp event

1367.6 --> 1373.08
what did I have seven dark Road

1371.4 --> 1376.3200000000002
fishing

1373.08 --> 1379.8799999999999
uh well te it sort of I mean it was sort

1376.32 --> 1382.72
of the moment where I iously chose and

1379.88 --> 1383.4
decided like I want to really wake up to

1382.72 --> 1385.52
the

1383.4 --> 1387.24
world like I don't want to have any

1385.52 --> 1389.9189999999999
Illusions anymore now of course I

1387.24 --> 1391.84
absolutely couldn't handle that but it's

1389.919 --> 1394.96
the first time I

1391.84 --> 1398.039
actually was

1394.96 --> 1401.72
even like capable of maneuvering my

1398.039 --> 1405.039
internal workings to like want it

1401.72 --> 1409.88
finally very very late adulthood you

1405.039 --> 1409.8799999999999
could call that like or

1410.039 --> 1416.0
it is kind of

1412.48 --> 1421.44
late I held it off very long I really

1416.0 --> 1423.679
held on to like my youth or youth my

1421.44 --> 1427.64
childhood in that sense I just did

1423.679 --> 1431.039
that's just dude I'm an elf I very

1427.64 --> 1433.159
slow very young looking and I'm old but

1431.039 --> 1435.96
I mean yeah I look still very damn young

1433.159 --> 1440.0800000000002
and it's G to stay that way so I'm

1435.96 --> 1443.679
slow very young I will grow very old and

1440.08 --> 1443.6789999999999
I will go through everything much

1451.08 --> 1457.279
slower right but uh yeah that sort of

1455.4 --> 1459.6000000000001
happened but of course also like the

1457.279 --> 1462.36
Jesuit guy and like he gave me those

1459.6 --> 1464.7199999999998
drugs and like he had that

1462.36 --> 1466.799
connection with the

1464.72 --> 1470.0
darkness a

1466.799 --> 1472.8799999999999
lot fully submersed in

1470.0 --> 1476.24
it with Future Insights and like

1472.88 --> 1479.6000000000001
knowledge of plans and like that JW guy

1476.24 --> 1481.72
knew about like the big dragons and all

1479.6 --> 1486.6789999999999
that like he knew

1481.72 --> 1489.3990000000001
them he met them that that

1486.679 --> 1490.8400000000001
level like they do they do get

1489.399 --> 1494.84
opportunities even when they're very

1490.84 --> 1494.84
young to like meet these

1496.76 --> 1499.76
dragons

1502.08 --> 1509.6789999999999
right so but I did not

1506.039 --> 1514.48
personally I merely kind of decided like

1509.679 --> 1514.48
I'm going to I'm going to learn about

1515.6 --> 1521.1999999999998
it and they were kind of hoping they the

1519.2 --> 1523.88
day evil

1521.2 --> 1526.039
day were kind of hoping that I was just

1523.88 --> 1529.1200000000001
going to come to their side completely

1526.039 --> 1531.799
because of like my intelligence me being

1529.12 --> 1534.4399999999998
capable of seeing how stupid [ __ ]

1531.799 --> 1537.32
people are everywhere already was very

1534.44 --> 1538.88
well aware of that so they're just

1537.32 --> 1540.84
hoping that I was going to come to their

1538.88 --> 1542.7600000000002
side but yeah that didn't work out

1540.84 --> 1544.52
because like my internal workings I

1542.76 --> 1546.8799999999999
don't have the stomach for it I don't

1544.52 --> 1550.1589999999999
have the actual stomach for real

1546.88 --> 1550.919
evil for real suppression and everything

1550.159 --> 1554.24
that

1550.919 --> 1554.24
comes with

1554.399 --> 1558.4799999999998
that very strong sense of justice and

1557.52 --> 1561.36
like

1558.48 --> 1564.52
like like it cannot like it can be

1561.36 --> 1568.6
flipped inside out but that doesn't last

1564.52 --> 1568.6
it will lead to self-destruction very

1570.52 --> 1573.72
quickly all

1578.159 --> 1585.159
right it's a lot if you 17 yeah it is if

1582.12 --> 1590.399
I'm 17 especially when the guy that did

1585.159 --> 1594.88
that is 14 yeah yeah you figure that out

1590.399 --> 1598.1589999999999
D it yeah a 14-year-old guy in school it

1594.88 --> 1600.72
happened in the school I literally

1598.159 --> 1602.1200000000001
remember the layout of the entire room

1600.72 --> 1605.279
and where it

1602.12 --> 1607.36
was cuz that place has been like

1605.279 --> 1609.039
savagely imprinted with throughout my

1607.36 --> 1612.399
Dark World

1609.039 --> 1614.679
Visions the echo of that moment like

1612.399 --> 1616.6
everything around me was just imprinted

1614.679 --> 1619.3600000000001
in the Dark World very

1616.6 --> 1622.6399999999999
strongly it kind of reminds

1619.36 --> 1625.8799999999999
me or other way around like uh what is

1622.64 --> 1628.039
it the newer Tron mover troll Legacy

1625.88 --> 1630.88
like oh we're going to go to the digital

1628.039 --> 1634.12
world and it's like and suddenly they're

1630.88 --> 1636.24
like they take the entire room with them

1634.12 --> 1637.6789999999999
to the other side it's all digitalized

1636.24 --> 1640.48
and then they kind of walk into the

1637.679 --> 1644.2
digital world well that's almost what

1640.48 --> 1647.88
it's like having had that stuff in that

1644.2 --> 1649.96
room I took the whole literal place with

1647.88 --> 1654.2
me to the Dark World and became like an

1649.96 --> 1655.559
emulation like that I kept being

1654.2 --> 1658.48
reminded

1655.559 --> 1662.559
of every time I dwelled on the other

1658.48 --> 1666.1200000000001
side or a lot of times and I liked it I

1662.559 --> 1667.72
liked it when I would get there I had

1666.12 --> 1671.399
more power

1667.72 --> 1674.039
there more Dynamic ability to do things

1671.399 --> 1674.039
like with the

1675.72 --> 1681.559
emulation yeah

1679.159 --> 1681.5590000000002
all right

1706.44 --> 1710.3200000000002
anyway

1709.0 --> 1714.279
that's

1710.32 --> 1714.279
hilarious that's a funny idea

1726.039 --> 1730.76
noer I think I feel where your game

1729.36 --> 1732.36
design is going that might be

1730.76 --> 1735.48
interesting if you could like have

1732.36 --> 1737.84
enough variations of that and even cross

1735.48 --> 1741.2
combinations as long as it's all l local

1737.84 --> 1741.1999999999998
it it like that could be pretty

1741.559 --> 1748.399
cool like a card M of card game of

1744.88 --> 1748.3990000000001
arguments and counter

1751.919 --> 1756.919
arguments it's

1753.72 --> 1756.919
interesting all

1757.24 --> 1764.039
right what whole of the size of 60 what

1760.919 --> 1764.039
are you talking about

1764.12 --> 1769.32
ter a hole in the sun it's all harsh

1770.64 --> 1776.679
[ __ ] they're just all fear poring

1773.399 --> 1780.279
everybody right they're it's because no

1776.679 --> 1782.88
the solar flare can destroy everything

1780.279 --> 1785.6
it's that [ __ ] teret it's oh my God the

1782.88 --> 1789.64
scary scary huge Sun it could destroy

1785.6 --> 1792.36
his all a solar flare could wipe out

1789.64 --> 1794.72
everything that's what it is it's always

1792.36 --> 1798.36
what it is when they do that it just

1794.72 --> 1800.1200000000001
means they want you all afraid why

1798.36 --> 1802.32
because they're projecting because

1800.12 --> 1806.1589999999999
they're afraid because they're losing

1802.32 --> 1809.8799999999999
mind control they're losing mind control

1806.159 --> 1813.96
so they Dole out the big disaster

1809.88 --> 1813.96
fear cuz they're losing mind

1814.32 --> 1818.9189999999999
control they're losing so they have to

1816.799 --> 1821.8799999999999
amp it

1818.919 --> 1826.44
up they have to make

1821.88 --> 1827.919
the terrible ecstasy stronger so that it

1826.44 --> 1831.679
will keep people

1827.919 --> 1834.48
people engaged with that instead of

1831.679 --> 1838.799
engaged with the solution against it all

1834.48 --> 1838.799
that is literally developing at a rapid

1842.039 --> 1847.919
Pace but I've seen that yeah I've heard

1844.559 --> 1850.279
it even Alex Jones is now doing like

1847.919 --> 1851.96
that kind of fear porn they're all like

1850.279 --> 1854.799
everybody that's inter fear porn they're

1851.96 --> 1854.799
all doing that

1855.2 --> 1860.2
now it's like they love it they just

1857.96 --> 1860.2
love

1873.159 --> 1876.159
it

1877.039 --> 1883.76
right so yeah the sun is not actually an

1880.12 --> 1886.1589999999999
object it it doesn't have a position

1883.76 --> 1889.799
it's not a

1886.159 --> 1892.48
chemical or electri or any process in

1889.799 --> 1896.399
any specific location that interacts

1892.48 --> 1899.72
with matter that creates the light that

1896.399 --> 1903.799
we see and that arrives here yeah there

1899.72 --> 1905.84
is literally no traceable origin Point

1903.799 --> 1907.679
except for

1905.84 --> 1911.1589999999999
apparent

1907.679 --> 1915.039
angular so the sun isn't an

1911.159 --> 1917.88
object it can't explode it can't go out

1915.039 --> 1920.639
there can't be holes in it and it can't

1917.88 --> 1923.519
eject a bunch of fiery

1920.639 --> 1925.4399999999998
wind in outer space vacuum which it

1923.519 --> 1928.36
would immediately explode

1925.44 --> 1931.88
into in all directions and never reach

1928.36 --> 1933.84
Earth right it's all ridiculous when you

1931.88 --> 1938.44
really think about

1933.84 --> 1941.6
it what there is a phenomenon apparently

1938.44 --> 1944.919
in this real world where the sun output

1941.6 --> 1948.12
whatever it is the the way the

1944.919 --> 1952.3200000000002
light basically arrives here

1948.12 --> 1952.32
there is like fluctuations in

1953.279 --> 1959.279
that and every time they Dole out fear

1956.88 --> 1961.519
porn about the sun is changing is doing

1959.279 --> 1965.519
this that's always related to like oh

1961.519 --> 1967.44
there's there might be expected or

1965.519 --> 1970.08
unexpected

1967.44 --> 1973.0
shifts in like light

1970.08 --> 1975.6
output and it scares them because

1973.0 --> 1978.279
they're just trying to uphold a nonsense

1975.6 --> 1980.7199999999998
story of globe and how it's supposed to

1978.279 --> 1982.88
work there with all these options of

1980.72 --> 1985.76
disasters that might happen to cover for

1982.88 --> 1987.88
the thing that's not understood and they

1985.76 --> 1989.679
using that as a cover story for the

1987.88 --> 1993.6000000000001
actual mechanics is probably more

1989.679 --> 1996.1200000000001
astrology based and just very known

1993.6 --> 1998.76
Cycles these energy outputs from the

1996.12 --> 2002.1999999999998
celestials which they know aren't

1998.76 --> 2004.799
objects and there might be things about

2002.2 --> 2009.32
these this knowledge that they're using

2004.799 --> 2012.76
to even like to keep control while they

2009.32 --> 2016.12
Dole out the the fake cosmology version

2012.76 --> 2018.96
to the public well maybe they're kind of

2016.12 --> 2021.5189999999998
like having unexpected results and maybe

2018.96 --> 2025.159
they find that they're kind of losing

2021.519 --> 2027.919
control because the things aren't really

2025.159 --> 2030.0
doing what they have been predicting all

2027.919 --> 2033.039
along

2030.0 --> 2035.96
anymore that's a lot of good reason for

2033.039 --> 2038.799
them to start really [ __ ] their

2035.96 --> 2041.3600000000001
pants

2038.799 --> 2043.6
like yeah yeah you're losing control

2041.36 --> 2046.24
you're so occupied with trying to mind

2043.6 --> 2047.8
control people into making them believe

2046.24 --> 2051.24
that you know

2047.8 --> 2054.56
everything while you literally have the

2051.24 --> 2056.56
actual knowledge slipping away from

2054.56 --> 2059.7599999999998
you

2056.56 --> 2064.159
huh it's fun isn't

2059.76 --> 2064.159
it being a globalist

2064.32 --> 2068.76
occultist secret society person trying

2067.32 --> 2073.2400000000002
to mind control everybody and you're

2068.76 --> 2075.119
losing control isn't that just

2073.24 --> 2078.7599999999998
great yeah

2075.119 --> 2082.32
because at the other end of everything

2078.76 --> 2085.8
God is there to decide how it is

2082.32 --> 2089.52
designed with foresight retroactive into

2085.8 --> 2092.0
the future so if you think you can gain

2089.52 --> 2094.52
control by understanding yeah oh guess

2092.0 --> 2096.599
what yeah God just like no it just

2094.52 --> 2099.28
turned out to be different because he

2096.599 --> 2101.88
can throughout time anticipate if you're

2099.28 --> 2105.6800000000003
trying to take control over

2101.88 --> 2109.32
reality and then have it be always have

2105.68 --> 2112.839
been different specifically to counter

2109.32 --> 2115.04
your attempt to overtake reality right

2112.839 --> 2117.7999999999997
because I think reality this is going to

2115.04 --> 2123.04
sound funny I think not the weather but

2117.8 --> 2127.28
the reality itself in a way is a dynamic

2123.04 --> 2130.7599999999998
system it's like a mesh of function

2127.28 --> 2135.6400000000003
reality function that God the designer

2130.76 --> 2139.2000000000003
from the outside can have pretty radical

2135.64 --> 2142.8799999999997
changes and like in a way that it like

2139.2 --> 2146.1189999999997
it cannot be traced that it is God doing

2142.88 --> 2148.319
that because it will always turn into no

2146.119 --> 2151.319
it it was always going to be

2148.319 --> 2154.7599999999998
that but nobody ever knew until it

2151.319 --> 2156.599
happened because only God knows cuz God

2154.76 --> 2158.88
can see everything happening throughout

2156.599 --> 2163.28
time and thereby designing things in a

2158.88 --> 2166.4
way to anticipate whatever happens

2163.28 --> 2169.28
retroactively yeah that's a reality

2166.4 --> 2174.319
shift that's

2169.28 --> 2179.079
a this ain't real God could change

2174.319 --> 2182.72
it like how things turned out to

2179.079 --> 2184.48
be and I believe God can anticipate with

2182.72 --> 2187.56
the design of all

2184.48 --> 2189.96
things and but then you yeah

2187.56 --> 2193.72
you get this conundrum this Paradox

2189.96 --> 2198.68
almost like is it God altering things

2193.72 --> 2202.72
retroactively knowing about time to stop

2198.68 --> 2204.7999999999997
the individual bound to time from get

2202.72 --> 2207.1189999999997
gain gaining such a grasp that they

2204.8 --> 2210.0
literally get more control over the

2207.119 --> 2213.48
world

2210.0 --> 2216.359
or did God literally always know exactly

2213.48 --> 2218.44
that was going to happen and free choice

2216.359 --> 2220.56
really is Just an Illusion that's still

2218.44 --> 2222.76
there but is technically taken into

2220.56 --> 2225.0789999999997
account thereby God can design

2222.76 --> 2227.44
everything at the beginning and never

2225.079 --> 2229.5600000000004
lift a finger ever since because he

2227.44 --> 2233.119
knows exactly how things are going to

2229.56 --> 2233.119
run and how people are going to choose

2233.4 --> 2238.839
things and then it wouldn't even need to

2236.079 --> 2244.76
be a dynamic

2238.839 --> 2244.7599999999998
system right but if there is a true free

2244.8 --> 2251.28
will that in time can change then then

2249.079 --> 2253.599
it can def then reality itself can

2251.28 --> 2255.8
definitely be like a dynamic system that

2253.599 --> 2257.88
God can from the outside

2255.8 --> 2261.76
alter

2257.88 --> 2263.4
retroactively to prevent and Avail

2261.76 --> 2266.28
certain things from

2263.4 --> 2269.28
happening and that could go a very W

2266.28 --> 2271.28
very large extent very broad like that

2269.28 --> 2274.48
could even be like

2271.28 --> 2277.8390000000004
environmental certain types of toxic

2274.48 --> 2280.64
disasters might happen that would

2277.839 --> 2283.7999999999997
actually really destroy a

2280.64 --> 2286.56
lot and like do irrevocable damage but

2283.8 --> 2289.2400000000002
then God can like make it

2286.56 --> 2291.7599999999998
completely not

2289.24 --> 2296.839
understandable change it so that it

2291.76 --> 2296.8390000000004
doesn't do that so that it is

2298.359 --> 2303.96
restored and just not in a way that any

2301.24 --> 2306.24
person can fre figure out how the hell

2303.96 --> 2310.319
that's mechanically possible they still

2306.24 --> 2310.319
do that I think it

2310.92 --> 2317.64
is so I'm kind of like divided in this

2314.4 --> 2318.8
dichotomy of how how to see it and God

2317.64 --> 2321.64
and what he can

2318.8 --> 2324.48
do do we really have free choice or this

2321.64 --> 2327.319
is this just a an illusion of the Matrix

2324.48 --> 2330.359
of our experience like do we just need

2327.319 --> 2332.839
to believe that we have free will

2330.359 --> 2335.52
right do we actually have free will or

2332.839 --> 2338.52
do we just need to believe we have free

2335.52 --> 2338.52
will

2338.68 --> 2344.64
for the effects psychological effects

2341.88 --> 2347.7200000000003
like the knowing which sin knowing which

2344.64 --> 2347.72
path type

2348.76 --> 2352.8
influences do we just need to believe

2351.16 --> 2355.64
that we have free

2352.8 --> 2357.7200000000003
will in order for the things to work as

2355.64 --> 2360.0
they are supposed to work or do we

2357.72 --> 2362.7999999999997
really have free will and in that case

2360.0 --> 2365.44
well unexpected things can really happen

2362.8 --> 2368.6400000000003
in accordance to the designer and then

2365.44 --> 2369.599
he would have to be able ble to after

2368.64 --> 2373.839
the

2369.599 --> 2378.079
fact alter things to accommodate the

2373.839 --> 2380.48
unexpected side effect of having real

2378.079 --> 2380.48
free

2381.079 --> 2385.6800000000003
choice I hope everybody's still

2383.16 --> 2385.68
following

2388.48 --> 2393.64
this maybe

2391.16 --> 2396.04
not right I'm going to take a bite of my

2393.64 --> 2398.359
Illuminati ah damn it it's cold I'm

2396.04 --> 2400.119
going to put put it back in the oven and

2398.359 --> 2403.64
I'm going to turn on my

2400.119 --> 2403.6400000000003
coffee be right

2425.359 --> 2428.359
back

2442.319 --> 2448.64
okay Illuminati C back in the oven

2445.52 --> 2448.64
coffee machine turn

2455.319 --> 2458.319
on

2460.92 --> 2466.52
change your free no hold on

2463.2 --> 2466.52
clutch no

2466.96 --> 2472.599
but God changes things because Free Will

2470.119 --> 2476.7200000000003
Choice then we would not have free will

2472.599 --> 2481.6400000000003
no no no no no no that's technically

2476.72 --> 2481.64
incorrect cuz God cannot change our

2482.72 --> 2489.9599999999996
mind but hey in the Free Will concept

2487.28 --> 2492.76
does it say anywhere that God is not

2489.96 --> 2494.2
allowed to literally change the design

2492.76 --> 2497.44
of

2494.2 --> 2501.04
reality yeah you might have wanted you

2497.44 --> 2504.0
may have wanted to read that fine

2501.04 --> 2509.04
print in the in the spiritual contract

2504.0 --> 2511.319
there yeah free wills cool we get it but

2509.04 --> 2514.48
that doesn't mean that

2511.319 --> 2516.839
oh you have the free will but God can't

2514.48 --> 2519.599
change anything about the the World it

2516.839 --> 2519.599
doesn't say

2524.16 --> 2529.92
that right and if God changes anything

2528.04 --> 2532.04
about the world there's definitely no

2529.92 --> 2536.0
nothing in the contract that says that

2532.04 --> 2539.119
you would be capable of seeing that God

2536.0 --> 2539.119
changed anything in the

2541.04 --> 2547.359
world he just is God he has absolute

2544.8 --> 2550.3590000000004
free power over that the only thing he

2547.359 --> 2553.319
doesn't have power over is to change our

2550.359 --> 2555.88
minds from the inside we change our

2553.319 --> 2559.319
minds we

2555.88 --> 2561.0
choose free choice that that doesn't

2559.319 --> 2563.04
mean that he can't change the world

2561.0 --> 2567.559
around

2563.04 --> 2567.5589999999997
us it literally doesn't say

2575.16 --> 2578.16
that

2578.72 --> 2585.48
do do you follow clutch what I mean do

2582.28 --> 2587.8390000000004
you see the the fine print in the

2585.48 --> 2591.359
contract do you see it

2587.839 --> 2591.359
now logical

2596.16 --> 2600.24
implications hope you're all enjoying

2598.04 --> 2603.44
the show if you do then yeah don't

2600.24 --> 2607.68
forget the Rogan it up I didn't sign any

2603.44 --> 2609.68
yes you did orino wble you you were born

2607.68 --> 2610.5589999999997
you signed the contract you're born

2609.68 --> 2614.72
you're

2610.559 --> 2616.92
there nobody lives that has not signed

2614.72 --> 2616.9199999999996
the

2618.599 --> 2624.839
contract nope nobody

2621.64 --> 2627.48
cares you have the free will to believe

2624.839 --> 2629.24
whatever the [ __ ] you want orino wble

2627.48 --> 2631.8
including that you didn't sign the

2629.24 --> 2634.24
spiritual contract with God that defined

2631.8 --> 2638.079
the rules of your condition of your

2634.24 --> 2638.0789999999997
existence yeah you did

2644.839 --> 2650.04
contract it spaces before c that's

2646.96 --> 2654.64
hilarious teret I don't think that God

2650.04 --> 2654.64
deals in that form of written lit like

2655.359 --> 2660.68
legalism think legalism is really a

2658.28 --> 2660.6800000000003
human

2663.599 --> 2668.44
invention how do you know lot iCal

2671.8 --> 2677.76
implications hey borders boy no

2674.559 --> 2677.76
notifications from

2678.359 --> 2681.5589999999997
yeah it

2684.96 --> 2691.4
happens but I mean do I mean if you just

2688.44 --> 2693.04
keep track of Twitter sorry that does

2691.4 --> 2695.96
really

2693.04 --> 2700.119
help because I always tweet out right

2695.96 --> 2700.119
before I go live

2705.24 --> 2709.4399999999996
always you must have thought it was a

2707.4 --> 2711.559
fake contract yeah but you don't have

2709.44 --> 2714.4
the thoughts

2711.559 --> 2717.4
yet how can you think such things when

2714.4 --> 2721.2400000000002
you have no contact for these thoughts

2717.4 --> 2721.2400000000002
because you weren't born yet D

2721.8 --> 2729.2400000000002
it like who says a spiritual contract is

2724.839 --> 2729.24
actually a piece of paper and ink

2729.68 --> 2736.5989999999997
yeah it's more like a vow it's just

2733.64 --> 2739.7599999999998
being told and

2736.599 --> 2743.559
saying thinking like you don't have a

2739.76 --> 2747.119
mouth you're a spirit Spirit can't

2743.559 --> 2750.2000000000003
literally move a pen and create a

2747.119 --> 2753.04
material signature on a piece of paper

2750.2 --> 2755.1189999999997
that's ridiculous yeah I'm not talking

2753.04 --> 2757.72
about that of course I'm talking

2755.119 --> 2760.839
metaphysical spiritual like

2757.72 --> 2763.319
Consciousness decision making learning

2760.839 --> 2766.599
that kind of thing things that you can

2763.319 --> 2766.599
do without a

2771.52 --> 2776.52
body which God are you talking about the

2774.52 --> 2778.92
one we all come from and the one we all

2776.52 --> 2781.969
go back

2778.92 --> 2781.969
[Music]

2784.8 --> 2787.8
to

2796.73 --> 2802.16
[Music]

2798.119 --> 2804.839
right or the true father if you will and

2802.16 --> 2807.3999999999996
by what I just described that context is

2804.839 --> 2811.359
even more pronounced because the real

2807.4 --> 2816.2000000000003
the God God the designer is really like

2811.359 --> 2818.5989999999997
the father of us of every human being

2816.2 --> 2823.24
with us at the beginning before we're

2818.599 --> 2825.2400000000002
born and is's with us when we die and

2823.24 --> 2828.64
who knows what happens he might like

2825.24 --> 2831.7599999999998
give us his rooms to enjoy or to

2828.64 --> 2835.839
contemplate or maybe send us

2831.76 --> 2839.8390000000004
back but he really is like our father

2835.839 --> 2839.839
delegating us and our

2844.72 --> 2847.72
souls

2849.32 --> 2852.539

2872.599 --> 2877.7200000000003
like following my train of thought in

2874.72 --> 2877.72
this

2883.8 --> 2891.28
you have no idea for a card that can

2886.839 --> 2893.72
counter the density card yeah D welcome

2891.28 --> 2896.76
to Flat Earth we

2893.72 --> 2898.68
know I could think of nonsense arguments

2896.76 --> 2901.0400000000004
but it would become literally

2898.68 --> 2904.1189999999997
nonsensical it would become like an anti

2901.04 --> 2907.64
Flat Earth argumentation game then

2904.119 --> 2912.76
so but you just keep on working on your

2907.64 --> 2912.7599999999998
card game I'm going to get my coffee and

2934.599 --> 2937.599

3264.079 --> 3267.079
off

3294.079 --> 3297.079
for

3298.72 --> 3301.24
that's right

3308.88 --> 3316.04
d kicks out trolls like a kick

3314.079 --> 3319.319
players Smash

3316.04 --> 3321.079
Bros yeah it does kind of feel like that

3319.319 --> 3322.88
even though I've never actually played

3321.079 --> 3325.6400000000003
that

3322.88 --> 3327.92
game I'm capable of imagining what

3325.64 --> 3330.5589999999997
you're talking about but it does feel

3327.92 --> 3333.119
like I take my time it's like oh oh

3330.559 --> 3336.88
somebody wants to get kicked out it's

3333.119 --> 3338.799
like right like like a real football

3336.88 --> 3340.6400000000003
player you have to focus first you don't

3338.799 --> 3342.7599999999998
just like oh the ball's there oh run

3340.64 --> 3346.5989999999997
against it kick no no no the players

3342.76 --> 3349.2400000000002
like okay the ball's there okay I'm just

3346.599 --> 3350.799
waiting Focus right on this amount of

3349.24 --> 3354.0389999999998
distance in meantime the

3350.799 --> 3356.96
trolls you pulled your own stand like

3354.039 --> 3360.4
yes this is the moment and I take the

3356.96 --> 3363.799
run and kick bang and it's a

3360.4 --> 3367.039
goal so that is kind of like how I kick

3363.799 --> 3368.64
trolls out I don't just immediately kick

3367.039 --> 3371.1600000000003
them

3368.64 --> 3373.2799999999997
out unless they're literally there

3371.16 --> 3375.52
specifically trying to ruin my flow and

3373.28 --> 3380.559
then I do immediately kick them out like

3375.52 --> 3380.559
before you can even read what they

3383.92 --> 3388.76
said but other times yeah I definitely

3386.24 --> 3390.5589999999997
like to like just put that ball right

3388.76 --> 3393.2000000000003
put that ball like right on the spot

3390.559 --> 3396.3190000000004
like not there no not there no right

3393.2 --> 3400.72
there just take your time Breathe In

3396.319 --> 3404.079
Breathe Out P your own you're such an

3400.72 --> 3407.16
idiot bang right you need to take your

3404.079 --> 3409.4
careful time just let it sit there just

3407.16 --> 3416.8799999999997
so that everybody just see that the ball

3409.4 --> 3416.88
is sitting there and then you kick it

3418.559 --> 3421.48
couldn't find a foot

3437.4 --> 3440.4
Emoji

3443.799 --> 3446.799
h

3456.72 --> 3462.109
and dupes don't be

3459.07 --> 3462.1090000000004
[Music]

3466.0 --> 3470.799
mean maybe it's just everybody just

3468.599 --> 3474.2000000000003
likes the Poke

3470.799 --> 3477.16
dupes I get it I mean I sometimes like

3474.2 --> 3479.839
the poke a little but you know when

3477.16 --> 3483.0389999999998
somebody's just like everybody's poking

3479.839 --> 3484.88
them I want to do the opposite and hey

3483.039 --> 3488.0
if I take that very far I'll always

3484.88 --> 3490.52
regret it I always have in the

3488.0 --> 3493.2
past but I just can't help it

3490.52 --> 3495.559
everybody's always like poking some

3493.2 --> 3498.3999999999996
individual putting them down I just

3495.559 --> 3500.599
start to really see myself in them for

3498.4 --> 3503.7200000000003
some reason and I'm like like I want you

3500.599 --> 3506.7200000000003
all to just stop doing that to

3503.72 --> 3506.72
him

3508.52 --> 3512.44
and then they'll probably be like oh and

3510.64 --> 3514.52
this happened in the past I would do

3512.44 --> 3517.52
that with somebody like in school or

3514.52 --> 3521.079
whatever and they would be like oh oh

3517.52 --> 3523.24
wow he actually is my are you my friend

3521.079 --> 3527.079
and I'm like yeah sure and then they

3523.24 --> 3530.359
turn out to be completely spaz

3527.079 --> 3533.28
idiotic or like emotionally just

3530.359 --> 3535.319
[ __ ] or whatever and then I feel

3533.28 --> 3537.2000000000003
like a freaking idiot

3535.319 --> 3540.079
for being stuck with them right but

3537.2 --> 3541.5589999999997
that's a physical situation like when

3540.079 --> 3545.8390000000004
you're in school and you befriend

3541.559 --> 3548.079
somebody you can't just like oh [ __ ] B

3545.839 --> 3550.44
no you're going to be seeing that person

3548.079 --> 3550.44
for a

3554.72 --> 3561.0789999999997
while duper is becoming the mascot of

3559.079 --> 3566.6400000000003
okay that's taking it a bit far there

3561.079 --> 3566.6400000000003
clutch but it does sound funny I guess

3567.44 --> 3570.48
pfp to a

3571.52 --> 3577.599
bird if you want duper I

3574.68 --> 3581.3999999999996
mean the picture you got is is very

3577.599 --> 3583.6800000000003
recognizable so don't change anything on

3581.4 --> 3583.6800000000003
my

3593.64 --> 3596.64
account

3602.599 --> 3607.839
imagine Smash Bro with flat earthers and

3605.16 --> 3610.1189999999997
oh yeah that's been done duper we're

3607.839 --> 3614.64
still kind of waiting for that but there

3610.119 --> 3616.88
is this uh Universal Street Fighter type

3614.64 --> 3618.92
game where you can literally program

3616.88 --> 3619.76
anything into it and it has like all

3618.92 --> 3623.28
these

3619.76 --> 3625.48
mods where all like every cartoon

3623.28 --> 3628.2400000000002
character and Anime char you've ever

3625.48 --> 3631.119
known is in

3628.24 --> 3634.5589999999997
it well you could definitely adapt that

3631.119 --> 3637.319
S I even made that suggestion in like

3634.559 --> 3640.4
2017 you can take that game

3637.319 --> 3642.92
system and literally start programming

3640.4 --> 3645.2000000000003
in like a rompus a fight the Flat Earth

3642.92 --> 3647.4
a Simon Dan and a Nathan Oakley a

3645.2 --> 3648.68
Quantum eraser and Arwin you could put

3647.4 --> 3652.0
all of that in

3648.68 --> 3653.799
there if you actually want to make that

3652.0 --> 3656.52
effort because it is a bit of effort to

3653.799 --> 3656.52
do that

3656.559 --> 3662.079
but yes that can be done if you're like

3659.2 --> 3664.68
a programmer nerd type you really like

3662.079 --> 3667.799
doing that sort of thing then that is

3664.68 --> 3671.64
definitely something that you could

3667.799 --> 3673.44
make it's like an open source code thing

3671.64 --> 3677.7599999999998
it's a program out there it's been out

3673.44 --> 3677.76
there for like two decades or

3683.44 --> 3686.44
more

3695.599 --> 3700.6400000000003
right

3696.559 --> 3704.079
anyway but I mean yeah duper I'm

3700.64 --> 3704.0789999999997
almost in my

3713.44 --> 3718.35
opinion wait

3715.22 --> 3718.35
[Music]

3719.599 --> 3726.119
what oh yeah Flat Earth debates live

3723.92 --> 3730.279
in 25

3726.119 --> 3734.2400000000002
minutes Today's Show is flown

3730.279 --> 3734.24
by I still got to give it a

3743.359 --> 3746.359
title

3766.52 --> 3772.839
a my m key is like really being a pain

3769.119 --> 3776.359
in the ass to like really like Ram it to

3772.839 --> 3776.359
just get it to work

3795.32 --> 3798.3790000000004
[Music]

3798.799 --> 3803.279
sometimes and the V also has a pain in

3801.559 --> 3806.279
the

3803.279 --> 3806.279
ass

3814.05 --> 3817.099
[Applause]

3823.2 --> 3825.7599999999998
oh this is

3830.279 --> 3835.44
interesting I want your opinion on this

3833.0 --> 3838.839
on this title that I'm not now putting

3835.44 --> 3842.48
there free will in a dynamic reality

3838.839 --> 3845.2
system God can change anything but

3842.48 --> 3848.96
you what do you

3845.2 --> 3851.52
think what do you think guys is that a

3848.96 --> 3851.52
title or

3863.2 --> 3866.2
what

3894.0 --> 3896.16
oh

3897.72 --> 3903.48
anything oh why is my chat still

3900.48 --> 3903.48
moving

3907.599 --> 3914.0
ah thanks duper anybody else has an

3911.4 --> 3914.0
opinion on

3918.43 --> 3921.469
[Music]

3923.079 --> 3926.079
this

3932.42 --> 3935.579
[Music]

3952.48 --> 3957.72
you think God can change our heart

3954.559 --> 3957.7200000000003
Hearts I

3960.4 --> 3967.96
disagree God

3963.16 --> 3972.319
because if somebody chooses to not do

3967.96 --> 3976.4
it then God can't change their

3972.319 --> 3980.0389999999998
heart and people changing their

3976.4 --> 3983.6800000000003
minds is literally within the entire

3980.039 --> 3985.5200000000004
Paradigm a complete mystery as in nobody

3983.68 --> 3988.279
knows

3985.52 --> 3991.119
what is actually the influence the force

3988.279 --> 3993.44
behind people changing their hearts

3991.119 --> 3996.279
changing their minds about things

3993.44 --> 3996.279
because of Free

4003.2 --> 4010.7599999999998
Will good title thanks Rich

4007.319 --> 4012.88
G so if God could literally change our

4010.76 --> 4016.2400000000002
hearts then we don't have free will

4012.88 --> 4019.839
that's the whole point but if we choose

4016.24 --> 4024.0
the right thing then God can

4019.839 --> 4027.52
like help you transform right but it's

4024.0 --> 4030.76
always after you chose that if you chose

4027.52 --> 4033.92
not to do something God can't make you

4030.76 --> 4037.2400000000002
choose that can't actually change your

4033.92 --> 4040.2400000000002
heart about the choice you're

4037.24 --> 4040.24
making

4042.92 --> 4045.92
right

4047.44 --> 4051.839
right that's the that's the whole point

4050.2 --> 4055.16
of Free

4051.839 --> 4059.24
Will right God can burden you in a lot

4055.16 --> 4064.5989999999997
of ways to try to force you to change or

4059.24 --> 4068.5989999999997
to test you to not change and you don't

4064.599 --> 4072.319
know you don't know and you never will

4068.599 --> 4074.96
really cuz you don't know where you are

4072.319 --> 4077.48
in the whole plan

4074.96 --> 4080.799
really and you can't

4077.48 --> 4081.599
now you can impose certain views of it

4080.799 --> 4084.92
on

4081.599 --> 4088.67
yourself declare that but you don't

4084.92 --> 4091.789
know cuz only God

4088.67 --> 4091.789
[Music]

4096.319 --> 4101.04
knows all right and you could say that

4098.359 --> 4105.839
if you declare something like I want

4101.04 --> 4105.839
this and I'll put and have it spoken out

4106.319 --> 4115.319
almost has like a a Quantum effect it

4111.839 --> 4118.5199999999995
breaks it breaks the the possibilities

4115.319 --> 4121.080000000001
and like manifest it it more because of

4118.52 --> 4123.1990000000005
it's It's spoken out it's if you say

4121.08 --> 4126.6
something then you are putting your

4123.199 --> 4129.3189999999995
decision behind that God

4126.6 --> 4133.120000000001
might accommodate for

4129.319 --> 4135.04
that so you can potentially to a degree

4133.12 --> 4138.96
impose your your view of how you want

4135.04 --> 4141.44
things on reality by declaring it if God

4138.96 --> 4144.56
agrees and if you know what is what if

4141.44 --> 4147.3189999999995
you know what is sin and what isn't sin

4144.56 --> 4147.319
if you got that

4147.56 --> 4153.400000000001
right but if you got it wrong then you

4150.56 --> 4155.759
can declare and impose upon reality

4153.4 --> 4156.92
however you see it it's not going to

4155.759 --> 4160.48
work like

4156.92 --> 4162.08
that cuz you didn't get it

4160.48 --> 4164.879999999999
right

4162.08 --> 4168.159
you're dissonant

4164.88 --> 4168.159000000001
with the workings of

4179.679 --> 4183.719
reality hey LSG good to see

4192.719 --> 4195.719
you

4203.36 --> 4206.12
all right anyway I hope you're all

4204.52 --> 4209.0
enjoying the

4206.12 --> 4211.12
show I knew this is so funny because

4209.0 --> 4213.36
yesterday I did the whole technique

4211.12 --> 4216.12
thing again because I literally do that

4213.36 --> 4218.88
every day absolutely every

4216.12 --> 4221.0
day and I had this whole thing about I

4218.88 --> 4224.719
was going to get a really big Insight I

4221.0 --> 4227.88
felt it I saw a tunnel into the future

4224.719 --> 4229.719
again and it happened like this happened

4227.88 --> 4232.36
right here I put it down right here it

4229.719 --> 4236.04
it happened exactly as I invisioned

4232.36 --> 4237.92
it while envisioning it not knowing what

4236.04 --> 4239.88
it was going to be about but I knew it

4237.92 --> 4243.0
was going to have a great Deb and I

4239.88 --> 4244.88
depth and I knew I was going to have

4243.0 --> 4246.92
complete Mastery over it but I didn't

4244.88 --> 4250.4800000000005
know what it was going to be yet and now

4246.92 --> 4253.8
it is here and I feel it now I'm feeling

4250.48 --> 4257.48
the other side of what I saw yesterday

4253.8 --> 4259.360000000001
evening night not evening yesterday

4257.48 --> 4263.599999999999
night when I was applying the technique

4259.36 --> 4268.4
and imprinting what I was going to do

4263.6 --> 4268.400000000001
today and it happened and it's

4270.19 --> 4276.5199999999995
[Music]

4273.159 --> 4282.04
amazing right now I still can't tell

4276.52 --> 4284.8
whether I created that for today with my

4282.04 --> 4288.64
imprint yesterday with the technique or

4284.8 --> 4292.719
whether it merely made me capable of

4288.64 --> 4297.639
picking up what was going to

4292.719 --> 4300.719
happen not relating to an act of will it

4297.639 --> 4303.36
just made me capable of seeing a little

4300.719 --> 4305.96
bit more into the future getting a bit

4303.36 --> 4307.4
of foresight right I don't know I don't

4305.96 --> 4310.52
know whether I just got a bit of

4307.4 --> 4314.5199999999995
foresight about the future or whether I

4310.52 --> 4317.320000000001
literally imprinted that and I can't

4314.52 --> 4320.4800000000005
really tell because sometimes it doesn't

4317.32 --> 4323.08
work I don't get a very clear imprint

4320.48 --> 4325.839999999999
about I get good ideas good principles

4323.08 --> 4328.4
that I can maintain and that works but

4325.84 --> 4331.32
no like oh I get a glimpse into the

4328.4 --> 4334.0
future a bit it doesn't always happen so

4331.32 --> 4338.0
that makes me feel about it

4334.0 --> 4340.76
statistically that maybe it's just a a

4338.0 --> 4344.159
reception it's not something I'm

4340.76 --> 4346.92
actually creating it's something I'm

4344.159 --> 4349.36
reaching I'm capable of reaching a

4346.92 --> 4352.0
glimpse from the future so I just pick

4349.36 --> 4356.199
it up it's not something I

4352.0 --> 4358.76
decide it's complicated I can't tell I

4356.199 --> 4361.36
can't tell which it is I would love to

4358.76 --> 4364.6
think that oh yeah Arn you can literally

4361.36 --> 4367.04
just project this greatness from your

4364.6 --> 4368.84
inside onto the future and then make

4367.04 --> 4371.56
that

4368.84 --> 4375.4400000000005
happen I love to believe that I would be

4371.56 --> 4375.4400000000005
able to do that but

4376.719 --> 4383.12
from like a curiosity perspective an

4379.239 --> 4384.759999999999
honesty perspective like I can't tell I

4383.12 --> 4387.32
can't

4384.76 --> 4390.1990000000005
tell whether I'm

4387.32 --> 4394.199
actually manifesting it in a future or

4390.199 --> 4397.159
merely clearing myself up to make it

4394.199 --> 4400.678999999999
possible and then receiving that

4397.159 --> 4402.12
future am I Conjuring it or am I merely

4400.679 --> 4407.56
receiving

4402.12 --> 4407.5599999999995
it I can't tell are you still

4408.96 --> 4413.56
following I were inspired by having

4411.4 --> 4417.04
duper in the chat yeah but duper does

4413.56 --> 4417.04
actually inspire me steamy

4418.4 --> 4425.96
traveler the guy just has this creative

4422.04 --> 4428.32
little mind in him for however clunky he

4425.96 --> 4430.84
can be but it's just that creativity

4428.32 --> 4432.36
Never Dies and I recognize it I was kind

4430.84 --> 4435.360000000001
of like

4432.36 --> 4435.36
that

4435.48 --> 4439.718999999999
and as I already said right everybody

4437.199 --> 4441.599999999999
piling on duper oh duper is an idiot

4439.719 --> 4444.96
duper is a troll

4441.6 --> 4449.08
dup and like yeah that's

4444.96 --> 4450.679
exactly what happened to me too when I

4449.08 --> 4453.96
was much

4450.679 --> 4457.639
younger so it's like

4453.96 --> 4461.28
yeah I recognize

4457.639 --> 4465.28
that okay go [ __ ] yourself that is

4461.28 --> 4465.28
absolutely evil

4483.159 --> 4487.08
wow it's absolutely

4492.28 --> 4495.28
ridiculous

4499.52 --> 4505.040000000001
you think you're going to get me with

4501.679 --> 4505.04
that dumb

4510.76 --> 4515.320000000001
[ __ ] I

4512.56 --> 4517.8
mean what you're trying to you don't

4515.32 --> 4520.12
even know who the person you're trying

4517.8 --> 4522.0
to emulate with your stupid troll

4520.12 --> 4524.28
attempt you don't even know what he's

4522.0 --> 4529.199
like at all

4524.28 --> 4529.199
you have no context to make such a

4530.28 --> 4538.08
remark you're just a stupid superficial

4534.44 --> 4541.839999999999
dumb [ __ ] projecting piece of

4538.08 --> 4545.04
trash that might have some shitty job

4541.84 --> 4547.2390000000005
and a super overinflated ego thanks to

4545.04 --> 4551.159
that that you can use like

4547.239 --> 4558.599999999999
a like a a rubber Hammer to try to bash

4551.159 --> 4558.599999999999
my head in with yeah a little balloon

4561.239 --> 4564.5199999999995
Hammer it's

4565.84 --> 4570.96
ridiculous you can't trigger me if

4568.639 --> 4573.96
you're too [ __ ]

4570.96 --> 4578.8
[ __ ] and

4573.96 --> 4582.12
simpleminded to even like touch my

4578.8 --> 4584.6
frequency of thinking

4582.12 --> 4587.96
yeah

4584.6 --> 4589.4400000000005
in other words if you're too lame and

4587.96 --> 4594.76
dumb and

4589.44 --> 4597.199
boring you can't trigger me [ __ ]

4594.76 --> 4600.8
with

4597.199 --> 4600.799999999999
yeah good luck with

4612.08 --> 4615.08
that

4617.639 --> 4622.8
but by all means support me through the

4620.4 --> 4626.0
PayPal and the patreon that would be

4622.8 --> 4628.8
great would be great no seeking star

4626.0 --> 4628.8
water don't do

4631.0 --> 4634.639
that don't address

4638.76 --> 4645.0
it you know that's actually my last name

4641.56 --> 4645.0
right seeking

4657.44 --> 4662.96
H didn't respond to all the com yeah but

4660.28 --> 4664.96
I mean I have to say

4662.96 --> 4667.36
something besides I was going to like

4664.96 --> 4672.0
round out the show

4667.36 --> 4675.0
anyway really my yeah

4672.0 --> 4675.0
really

4677.159 --> 4681.48
like that's my father's

4679.639 --> 4684.679
name for

4681.48 --> 4687.199
real and he would never ever talk to me

4684.679 --> 4690.76
especially in

4687.199 --> 4695.599999999999
English and he would never like he's

4690.76 --> 4699.719
never ever even said the word

4695.6 --> 4701.719
[ __ ] yeah my dad's a really non swearing

4699.719 --> 4704.12
type of guy

4701.719 --> 4707.44
like he he doesn't mind if other people

4704.12 --> 4709.8
do it he just doesn't do it not because

4707.44 --> 4712.199
somebody told him it was bad or because

4709.8 --> 4715.639
he thinks he's bad it just he just

4712.199 --> 4720.199
doesn't do it he just doesn't do

4715.639 --> 4725.0
it so yet another giant

4720.199 --> 4728.08
pit giant black hole of lack of

4725.0 --> 4729.96
knowledge about anything that you're

4728.08 --> 4731.92
trying to emulate to troll me it's

4729.96 --> 4734.92
[ __ ]

4731.92 --> 4734.92
pathetic

4739.88 --> 4744.439
yeah

4741.33 --> 4744.439
[Music]

4745.48 --> 4752.4
anyway yeah no apologies needed seeking

4747.92 --> 4754.76
star water it's perfectly fine right

4752.4 --> 4758.199
anyway moving towards rounding out the

4754.76 --> 4758.1990000000005
show a little bit shorter than

4758.56 --> 4764.84
normal get a Mitchell from Australia

4761.84 --> 4764.84
card

4765.04 --> 4768.6
definitely Mitchell from Australia

4766.84 --> 4771.84
definitely is one of the guys I mean he

4768.6 --> 4774.159000000001
is with us he's he's our good friend

4771.84 --> 4774.159000000001
down

4780.239 --> 4785.5199999999995
south I mean if there's going to be like

4782.92 --> 4787.6
cards of like flat earthers I definitely

4785.52 --> 4789.360000000001
like Flat Earth debate flat earthers I

4787.6 --> 4791.280000000001
definitely want Mitchell from Australia

4789.36 --> 4793.719
with that he he definitely deserves a

4791.28 --> 4795.84
spot even though he's not like a steady

4793.719 --> 4798.679
panelist I mean that guy's made some

4795.84 --> 4802.88
really good Flat Earth

4798.679 --> 4802.88
videos and Drone footage and all

4805.28 --> 4811.239
that fornicate under consent of the king

4808.719 --> 4814.6
yeah yeah

4811.239 --> 4814.599999999999
weird so

4821.76 --> 4824.76
weird

4828.0 --> 4831.6
right which is by the way clutch

4829.36 --> 4834.08
technically that's kind of

4831.6 --> 4836.76
satanic

4834.08 --> 4840.6
right I mean that literally makes that

4836.76 --> 4843.400000000001
King that would consent to that

4840.6 --> 4846.4400000000005
non-Christian so satanic so that

4843.4 --> 4849.199
actually kind of makes the word [ __ ] a

4846.44 --> 4852.32
satanic word which indicates

4849.199 --> 4854.12
the corruption of the decency of a king

4852.32 --> 4858.12
that he would

4854.12 --> 4858.12
allow his subjects to

4860.96 --> 4867.6
fornicate which which is traditionally

4863.719 --> 4871.08
illegal that's very interesting

4867.6 --> 4874.08
clutch what about an Arwin

4871.08 --> 4874.08
card

4876.52 --> 4882.400000000001
uh well you could use the Arwin card as

4879.52 --> 4884.679
like a arnian arguments which is always

4882.4 --> 4886.4
like Joker card because it just gives

4884.679 --> 4888.2390000000005
you something that like nobody really

4886.4 --> 4890.92
knows how to respond to that you can't

4888.239 --> 4890.919999999999
really deny

4892.52 --> 4897.280000000001
it

4894.4 --> 4899.638999999999
like what I talk about people like the

4897.28 --> 4902.4
real cosmogeny that I talk like people

4899.639 --> 4904.08
can't actually just make a case and like

4902.4 --> 4908.92
no Arn you're

4904.08 --> 4908.92
wrong because you just can't you just

4909.159 --> 4913.44
can't because I could be right about

4912.28 --> 4915.44
these things

4913.44 --> 4918.48
I absolutely could be and there's

4915.44 --> 4921.04
literally nothing you can do to

4918.48 --> 4923.4
disprove that I might be right about

4921.04 --> 4926.92
these conclusions that I

4923.4 --> 4931.5199999999995
draw these scenarios that I lay down

4926.92 --> 4931.52
about the layout of the realm and its

4931.679 --> 4936.6
properties so you could in that sense

4933.96 --> 4938.04
make an rwin card like that like it's a

4936.6 --> 4940.04
joker card it's like yeah it's always

4938.04 --> 4943.36
going to work but nobody will know how

4940.04 --> 4947.48
like you can't put another card on that

4943.36 --> 4949.759999999999
unless it's a pure adom right it's like

4947.48 --> 4951.5199999999995
our win card can pretty much Trump a lot

4949.76 --> 4957.1990000000005
of arguments

4951.52 --> 4957.1990000000005
but only Adam could take it

4958.679 --> 4965.8
down balers Gate 3 won game of the year

4962.239 --> 4969.5599999999995
at the video game award I don't know why

4965.8 --> 4969.56
LSG I don't know

4969.6 --> 4974.56
why I mean yeah it was okay

4975.4 --> 4983.04
but the story was [ __ ] lame it had

4980.52 --> 4986.080000000001
absolutely nothing to do with balers

4983.04 --> 4988.32
gate literally nothing not a traditional

4986.08 --> 4990.44
character from balers gate not

4988.32 --> 4993.08
one no

4990.44 --> 4995.239
recognizable plot that would actually

4993.08 --> 4998.679
involve balers

4995.239 --> 5002.199
gate nothing absolutely nothing like

4998.679 --> 5005.2390000000005
that game should not be allowed to be

5002.199 --> 5007.0
called balers gate it literally

5005.239 --> 5010.44
shouldn't be allowed to be called balers

5007.0 --> 5013.08
gate it's it's just a [ __ ] name steel

5010.44 --> 5016.879999999999
for a game that has absolutely nothing

5013.08 --> 5019.88
to do with the original franchise it's

5016.88 --> 5023.84
[ __ ] I mean it's a cool game sure

5019.88 --> 5026.88
right I mean but the way I see how it

5023.84 --> 5029.639
works it just really reminds me more of

5026.88 --> 5031.36
the never winter nights franchise

5029.639 --> 5033.1990000000005
especially never winter nights 2 it's

5031.36 --> 5035.32
very much like that

5033.199 --> 5037.28
it looks a lot like we had never wi

5035.32 --> 5040.12
night and they played that game a lot

5037.28 --> 5043.159
it's very alike I mean it's almost the

5040.12 --> 5045.4
exact same plot yeah in never winter

5043.159 --> 5048.4
nights 2 one of the more advanced down

5045.4 --> 5050.759999999999
the road expansions of it was called

5048.4 --> 5055.199
mask of the betrayer in which you are

5050.76 --> 5058.679
literally like a parasal spirit gets in

5055.199 --> 5063.5199999999995
you like a ghost a Hungry Ghost that

5058.679 --> 5066.6
cannot be removed yeah sounds fam

5063.52 --> 5068.4800000000005
failure yeah mask of the betrayer Spirit

5066.6 --> 5071.04
eater oh it's a whole special boy

5068.48 --> 5074.5599999999995
mechanic that you have to deal with oh

5071.04 --> 5078.0
oh like a stupid [ __ ] brain parasite

5074.56 --> 5081.400000000001
that you could use for poers how

5078.0 --> 5084.44
original Boulders game 3 you're so

5081.4 --> 5086.119
[ __ ] original you literally like

5084.44 --> 5088.759999999999
clone

5086.119 --> 5093.4
copied never winter night too the mask

5088.76 --> 5097.280000000001
of the betrayer it's pathetic it wasn't

5093.4 --> 5100.32
even a good freaking concept it that

5097.28 --> 5103.28
that entire game was only cool because

5100.32 --> 5106.599999999999
you got Epic Level because you could

5103.28 --> 5108.44
become like level 30 or something and

5106.6 --> 5110.76
because there was like you could go to

5108.44 --> 5113.5199999999995
other dimensions like the astral plane

5110.76 --> 5115.96
and like meet a dead God in the astral

5113.52 --> 5118.080000000001
plane which is freaking awesome yeah

5115.96 --> 5123.119
mask of the betrayer never wi nights 2

5118.08 --> 5126.4
was really good because of the Epic

5123.119 --> 5129.159
world and all the dimensions and that

5126.4 --> 5130.679
was awesome the music was good too yeah

5129.159 --> 5134.638999999999
this new

5130.679 --> 5137.4800000000005
thing is like the same model except

5134.639 --> 5139.84
without the Epic story and it has

5137.48 --> 5143.28
nothing to do with [ __ ] balers gate

5139.84 --> 5145.6
at all it's

5143.28 --> 5147.679
ridiculous yeah now the game mechanics

5145.6 --> 5149.1990000000005
might be pretty good and revolutionary

5147.679 --> 5151.4
oh that's really nice yeah it has

5149.199 --> 5152.96
absolutely [ __ ] all to do with balers

5151.4 --> 5155.839999999999
gate

5152.96 --> 5159.56
it's [ __ ] I hate the game also it's

5155.84 --> 5161.76
slow as [ __ ] you have to just like you

5159.56 --> 5164.400000000001
could probably only play that game

5161.76 --> 5166.320000000001
properly on Nathan's computer because

5164.4 --> 5169.599999999999
Nathan's computer is like a high-end

5166.32 --> 5172.84
thing that like really can like Ram it

5169.6 --> 5174.280000000001
out and thereby not slow your computer

5172.84 --> 5177.159000000001
down to all

5174.28 --> 5180.599999999999
hell it's that kind of a game yeah it's

5177.159 --> 5184.199
a really a super high-end game that

5180.6 --> 5187.6
sucks your computer

5184.199 --> 5189.48
and for rolling out a game quality

5187.6 --> 5193.280000000001
that's just equal to never wi winter

5189.48 --> 5195.919999999999
nights too yeah that I can play on this

5193.28 --> 5200.04
computer and like play three other games

5195.92 --> 5202.4
without any issues yeah so is it really

5200.04 --> 5207.0
worth it Boulders Gate 3 are you really

5202.4 --> 5211.199
that good no no you're

5207.0 --> 5214.119
not this is a freaking con

5211.199 --> 5217.4
job

5214.119 --> 5220.28
it's a con job them winning who [ __ ]

5217.4 --> 5220.28
voted for that

5220.8 --> 5227.1990000000005
[ __ ] yeah 100 bucks yeah it was it was

5224.56 --> 5229.280000000001
80

5227.199 --> 5233.4
clutch

5229.28 --> 5235.639
80 it's it literally the most expensive

5233.4 --> 5239.32
video game I have ever

5235.639 --> 5239.32
bought and it

5239.639 --> 5247.76
sucked I could barely even get to work

5243.679 --> 5251.04
for like the first month

5247.76 --> 5253.56
pathetic no sorry I hate it and it has

5251.04 --> 5256.56
absolutely nothing to do with baldish

5253.56 --> 5256.56
gate

name because it has absolutely nothing

5267.04 --> 5272.8
to do with Ballers gate and should be
