through the Pay Pal patreon my GoFundMe

65.199 --> 74.59
and the super chats that would be much

67.479 --> 77.16
appreciated so today it's kind of a yeah

74.59 --> 81.43
another day another type of weather

77.16 --> 86.92
really cloudy it feels like it's really

81.43 --> 90.58000000000001
moist and yeah it's like light waves of

86.92 --> 95.289
light rain just comes and goes and it's

90.58 --> 97.149
not super cold but still yeah I bet if

95.289 --> 98.92
you like if I go on a bicycle I'm

97.149 --> 101.17
definitely gonna wear gloves and all

98.92 --> 103.56
that because with all that moist in the

101.17 --> 109.66
air you're gonna cool off really quickly

103.56 --> 114.0
so yeah they're interesting to see that

109.66 --> 117.61
the workers over there that have been

114.0 --> 120.31
jackhammering those pylons in in the

117.61 --> 122.739
ground a couple of weeks ago started to

120.31 --> 124.78
progress they finished that process and

122.739 --> 129.42000000000002
I think I think they're gonna like build

124.78 --> 131.77
a bridge there so that's interesting

129.42 --> 133.80999999999997
like I don't know why that would be

131.77 --> 136.84
necessary but it looks interesting at

133.81 --> 139.78
least so anyway I got tumeric off this

136.84 --> 145.959
is not Tamera coffee I got green tea

139.78 --> 148.62
with me and half a sandwich with yeah

145.959 --> 151.629
what I'm eating these days it's like

148.62 --> 155.17000000000002
sandwich spread but all organic vegan

151.629 --> 158.79
stuff and it's surprisingly delicious I

155.17 --> 162.129
got one with a free package for savings

158.79 --> 163.84
action like you get stamps and then if

162.129 --> 166.12
you got a full card you get a box with

163.84 --> 167.89000000000001
stuff from the store typically and that

166.12 --> 170.709
was in there and it's surprisingly

167.89 --> 173.14
delicious so I think my time for straw

170.709 --> 176.62
bellied straw

173.14 --> 179.52999999999997
very jelly sandwich in the morning is

176.62 --> 181.89000000000001
over I love this stuff and it feels

179.53 --> 190.87
really good mmm

181.89 --> 192.91
anyway yeah as soon as I started up I

190.87 --> 196.6
usually start out by skipping the ads

192.91 --> 203.5
but in this case today saw something so

196.6 --> 210.88
funny cuz guess what the ad was so I put

203.5 --> 213.73
it on pause yeah and I'm gonna I can't

210.88 --> 216.97
play it back but I'm gonna play it on

213.73 --> 219.48899999999998
the show the ad that I got which

216.97 --> 222.73
immediately showed Neil deGrasse Tyson I

219.489 --> 237.13
just thought it was hilarious so here

222.73 --> 240.08999999999997
you go you can turn data to information

237.13 --> 243.09
information into knowledge knowledge

240.09 --> 243.09
wisdom

243.31 --> 247.27
the good thing about science is that

245.44 --> 248.82999999999998
it's true whether or not you believe in

247.27 --> 250.66
it what does it mean to be skeptical

248.83 --> 253.78
what does it mean to be convinced by day

250.66 --> 255.85
I will be quit you is it not only find

253.78 --> 260.29
objective truth but then communicate to

255.85 --> 262.96
others how to get there less connected

260.29 --> 264.79
you are to what is objectively true the

262.96 --> 267.64
less likely you will be able to make

264.79 --> 270.04
decisions it will benefit your life your

267.64 --> 272.52
life the life of your family and even

270.04 --> 276.15000000000003
civilization itself

[Music]

425.62 --> 431.47
[Music]

432.37 --> 447.889
anyway yeah what was watching flat water

441.529 --> 451.129
earlier another video book Paul visions

447.889 --> 454.669
of st. Paul was good I didn't get that

451.129 --> 456.529
far but it was very interesting it's

454.669 --> 459.04999999999995
always interesting these stories and

456.529 --> 462.02
even how its described it's just like

459.05 --> 464.719
wow that's like I don't want to be

462.02 --> 468.139
presumptuous but I kind of exactly know

464.719 --> 475.61
what is what that is like what that

468.139 --> 480.49
Xperia T is just staggering although I

475.61 --> 486.529
like it seems like you call him Enoch

480.49 --> 489.08
had just this very unique close-up to

486.529 --> 491.289
like that into heaven I guess or the

489.08 --> 494.719
house of God or the other dimensions

491.289 --> 500.029
I've never personally experienced it in

494.719 --> 503.539
that way I think I knew about Enoch as I

500.029 --> 505.49
entered but I was literally just trying

503.539 --> 508.909
to find my own way much more concerned

505.49 --> 511.339
about these times I did see some I did

508.909 --> 515.329
learn some things for example I needed

511.339 --> 518.74
to know like if Christ the man that

515.329 --> 522.4399999999999
actually existed because back then I had

518.74 --> 524.9590000000001
huge doubts you know I didn't understand

522.44 --> 530.12
it yet and from that angle and all but

524.959 --> 533.529
but it's just fascinating to see well

530.12 --> 533.529
what seems to be testimony

533.579 --> 545.68
of these visions yeah what

542.97 --> 546.37
Brenda's song from YouTube I don't know

545.68 --> 549.069
what that is

546.37 --> 553.48

sorry about that Peter Harrington also

676.649 --> 686.3
did I prove Jesus well I absolutely did

687.019 --> 696.54
like very to me I have like from the

693.54 --> 700.829
visions no doubt that the flesh and

696.54 --> 703.41
blood man Jesus that that has been

700.829 --> 707.81
eventually yeah

703.41 --> 712.069
become the amazing legend of the Bible

707.81 --> 715.1389999999999
that that is a that was a real man and

712.069 --> 717.8389999999999
the most miraculous thing of us is like

715.139 --> 720.269
in a way I try to I couldn't imagine

717.839 --> 721.62
that so that a man would do what he

720.269 --> 725.639
would do like at the time I just

721.62 --> 728.36
couldn't imagine it so I even like try

725.639 --> 730.649
to tell him about the future and what

728.36 --> 733.7090000000001
things that were gonna happen and

730.649 --> 740.79
everything and it just said like yeah I

733.709 --> 743.3389999999999
know still have to do this and he would

740.79 --> 747.7199999999999
not be swayed in any way so that that

743.339 --> 750.389
was my recollection of interactions on

747.72 --> 752.9590000000001
the other side and it saw some pretty

750.389 --> 752.9590000000001
amazing things

759.769 --> 765.589
like one of the things was is that I did

762.87 --> 777.48
actually see him ascend into heaven that

765.589 --> 777.72
was pretty amazing hmm yeah ranty flat

777.48 --> 780.57
earth

777.72 --> 784.73
I put yeah that was ridiculous isn't it

780.57 --> 792.0500000000001
I that was the ad I got on my show what

784.73 --> 792.0500000000001
are you doing don't

794.71 --> 799.22
yeah

796.76 --> 803.18
now I'm not gonna do that but anyway

799.22 --> 805.94
yeah Randy I that was the ad I got on my

803.18 --> 808.399
early bird show myself so I thought wow

805.94 --> 811.07
I'm gonna pause this and then show it on

808.399 --> 816.139
the show and it is like a wizard school

811.07 --> 818.6
it's so ridiculous and he even brings

816.139 --> 820.82
the communicator in it too it's like I

818.6 --> 825.0790000000001
think that science communicator is like

820.82 --> 829.339
the new trademark name that they're

825.079 --> 839.3889999999999
gonna give what they do the brand new

829.339 --> 841.19
song okay I'll check it out yeah if

839.389 --> 844.269
you're gonna be telling me to do that

841.19 --> 850.0100000000001
that makes it kind of suspicious

844.269 --> 852.91
I'm gonna listen to it on headphones see

850.01 --> 852.91
what it is

857.26 --> 871.5699999999999
okay yeah that's definitely not

869.8 --> 877.3599999999999
something I'm gonna play in the show

871.57 --> 887.38
thank you very much but I guess it was

877.36 --> 888.85
only a matter of time no I'm not gonna

887.38 --> 890.92
freakin play it hm

888.85 --> 893.77
tone it down this is not for the early

890.92 --> 895.9
bird show but hey if you want to listen

893.77 --> 901.9499999999999
to that [ __ ] and get all ballistic on

895.9 --> 916.81
your side by all means I get it

901.95 --> 924.85
link is in chat yeah that's pretty

916.81 --> 926.04
hardcore dude like literally no you

924.85 --> 929.0400000000001
couldn't hear it

926.04 --> 929.04
really

932.56 --> 944.029
okay damn it

937.93 --> 946.16
right okay well okay yeah I didn't know

944.029 --> 951.5889999999999
that that's weird I didn't know that the

946.16 --> 960.23
Sun would just relay I I have my firefox

951.589 --> 964.82
turn off how can that be okay so if I

960.23 --> 968.9200000000001
turn the visuals off in OBS the sound

964.82 --> 968.9200000000001
will still really what is this

977.11 --> 984.5790000000001
all right maybe it's just the the

979.72 --> 986.649
desktop audio input desktop oh yeah I

984.579 --> 989.709
had if I would have wanted that sign in

986.649 --> 993.089
I had to turn that off I get it now all

989.709 --> 997.56
right so anyway hmm

993.089 --> 997.5600000000001
thanks for that that's just great

1009.02 --> 1013.55
get around back what are you talking

1011.72 --> 1021.77
about AGM I don't understand what you're

1013.55 --> 1025.6699999999998
saying the volume ow damn it so you

1021.77 --> 1027.559
heard it's like a really loud yeah it's

1025.67 --> 1031.449
because when I have headphones in the

1027.559 --> 1031.449
volume is much lower so I turned it off

1037.87 --> 1047.8999999999999
yeah I guess it is kind of typical for

1045.29 --> 1050.75
that style of music it's really not my

1047.9 --> 1054.23
music never has been I liked when I was

1050.75 --> 1057.429
in school during my mid and late teens

1054.23 --> 1059.9
that was like before now during my teens

1057.429 --> 1061.88
that was like a real hype in the

1059.9 --> 1064.13
Netherlands and was like everyone would

1061.88 --> 1067.7600000000002
be shaving their freaking head bald like

1064.13 --> 1069.92
seriously even really young kids even

1067.76 --> 1071.84
children they're like doing that with

1069.92 --> 1073.5800000000002
children and it's like okay it's not

1071.84 --> 1076.01
super weird but they would listen to

1073.58 --> 1077.3
that music like really young children I

1076.01 --> 1080.48
thought that was kind of freaky like

1077.3 --> 1084.74
that's not healthy but that was like a

1080.48 --> 1085.55
real thing in the Netherlands called it

1084.74 --> 1088.19
like hubber

1085.55 --> 1090.6789999999999
and not the hardcore scene that that's

1088.19 --> 1093.8600000000001
kind of what grew out of it still around

1090.679 --> 1099.23
it was like a whole hyped thing before

1093.86 --> 1100.82
the and the 90s anyway and then

1099.23 --> 1102.5
everybody would be listening to this

1100.82 --> 1106.6
music and it would be all over the radio

1102.5 --> 1106.6
and I don't really like it that much

1108.25 --> 1111.25
yeah

1117.33 --> 1120.1399999999999
all right

1125.88 --> 1137.7600000000002
okay that turn the broke me out of out

1130.799 --> 1141.45
of my flow thanks for that workout music

1137.76 --> 1144.86
well if you like angry workouts don't

1141.45 --> 1144.8600000000001
think that's super healthy to do

1166.919 --> 1173.969
right anyway yeah let's let's get back

1179.249 --> 1183.419
man

1180.58 --> 1186.999
it's a bit weird because I think like

1183.419 --> 1189.009
cannabis seems to be yeah I said I said

1186.999 --> 1190.8990000000001
like things are working differently and

1189.009 --> 1192.849
I don't get like the fear response from

1190.899 --> 1194.859
canvas anymore but I don't know today

1192.849 --> 1198.4589999999998
seems to be making quite an impact I did

1194.859 --> 1201.339
have smoke before and like whoa lasts

1198.459 --> 1203.799
longer I guess that it that would be I

1201.339 --> 1205.9589999999998
should have expected that I need to be a

1203.799 --> 1208.6589999999999
little bit more careful with my timing

1205.959 --> 1215.079
these days because I was smoking a lot

1208.659 --> 1217.179
and now it's like whoo shoot down yes I

1215.079 --> 1220.959
have downloaded it I haven't reread

1217.179 --> 1227.219
through it yet I'm not a great fan of

1220.959 --> 1227.219
reading large books never have been

1228.599 --> 1236.1689999999999
right well that could have something to

1231.07 --> 1240.609
do with it Capra soul because yeah it

1236.169 --> 1243.3990000000001
just so happens to be that like the

1240.609 --> 1245.1689999999999
typical cannabis that I get my favorite

1243.399 --> 1246.6999999999998
and the one that I also brought to the

1245.169 --> 1248.169
Amsterdam conference because I think

1246.7 --> 1252.82
it's the best one I've ever had

1248.169 --> 1256.3590000000002
that's like run out so it's unclear as

1252.82 --> 1258.849
to why it's just run out so I made it so

1256.359 --> 1261.9089999999999
I'm kind of like taking an alternative

1258.849 --> 1263.95
and I really don't like it as much so

1261.909 --> 1268.509
that may have some influence on it but

1263.95 --> 1270.339
it's still a an indica strain and I

1268.509 --> 1274.089
usually don't have a lot of trouble from

1270.339 --> 1276.309
those but still it's like poof I just

1274.089 --> 1280.089
feel it it's like when I was young man

1276.309 --> 1281.979
when I actually smoked it just had a lot

1280.089 --> 1284.1689999999999
of impact lasted very long and that's

1281.979 --> 1286.929
also kind of the problem that I had when

1284.169 --> 1289.3890000000001
I was young is that it really had the

1286.929 --> 1292.69
tendency to kind of take away all the

1289.389 --> 1295.889
time because I would just be in a dream

1292.69 --> 1295.8890000000001
very heavily

1296.15 --> 1306.0500000000002
and have inspiration and drawing things

1299.31 --> 1308.25
and all yeah I had a blast like Louie

1306.05 --> 1314.61
and I don't really like that one

1308.25 --> 1317.12
too much anyway yeah right what have I

1314.61 --> 1320.25
been doing yesterday

1317.12 --> 1322.4899999999998
did finally manage to go to bed not that

1320.25 --> 1322.49
late

1323.63 --> 1330.68
lots of the livestreams YouTube let's

1328.38 --> 1330.68
see

1350.279 --> 1357.179
Karen B oh yeah Karen B was on yesterday

1354.479 --> 1359.3990000000001
I didn't see it live and was in the

1357.179 --> 1364.3490000000002
night yeah I didn't stay up until 4

1359.399 --> 1365.849
o'clock so but I did was it earlier than

1364.349 --> 1367.6789999999999
that I don't know what did I see no I

1365.849 --> 1370.499
didn't see it life but I did watch some

1367.679 --> 1374.3090000000002
of it because I tend to really like her

1370.499 --> 1379.799
streams but this guy that called in was

1374.309 --> 1382.4089999999999
just so just kept on rambling and

1379.799 --> 1384.96
rambling he's just being all come yeah

1382.409 --> 1386.969
sorry I don't like to call people that

1384.96 --> 1393.44
but this guy really fell into nakum

1386.969 --> 1399.089
spirit art category is just I was and I

1393.44 --> 1401.989
guess it happens getting overwhelmed by

1399.089 --> 1401.989
all the information

1419.12 --> 1423.6699999999998
all right mark colored

1425.76 --> 1428.76
Pyne

1430.299 --> 1437.289
now but I don't get anxiety that used to

1433.839 --> 1441.279
happen it's not it's just flustering me

1437.289 --> 1444.249
a little it's yeah it's like in the old

1441.279 --> 1447.159
days I know it's been smoked in over 25

1444.249 --> 1450.309
years roughly over that course of time

1447.159 --> 1453.519
but it like I said something happened it

1450.309 --> 1455.559
really did and I just seem to now

1453.519 --> 1457.33
respond much more like when I was young

1455.559 --> 1460.4189999999999
so I need to be a little bit more

1457.33 --> 1461.9089999999999
careful with it in the long run it's

1460.419 --> 1465.0990000000002
probably gonna save me a lot of money

1461.909 --> 1469.0890000000002
means I'll have to smoke less and it's

1465.099 --> 1472.109
gonna save some costs so may work out to

1469.089 --> 1472.109
my advantage also

1476.46 --> 1479.599
[Music]

1489.179 --> 1496.7
all right so let's talking about let's

1493.799 --> 1496.7
talk about other things

1505.91 --> 1521.25
right yeah oh yeah mind war petty a

1511.46 --> 1523.5900000000001
funny video on his channel like he did

1521.25 --> 1528.42
another CGI thing and he basically

1523.59 --> 1530.22
modeled the ECG ID earth ball and it

1528.42 --> 1536.1000000000001
looked really good it looked like movie

1530.22 --> 1539.6100000000001
quality and I also requested in the

1536.1 --> 1541.56
comments hey could if you're really that

1539.61 --> 1543.8999999999999
good could you maybe help me out with

1541.56 --> 1546.5
certain type of modeling that have been

1543.9 --> 1549.24
looking for for a long time maybe

1546.5 --> 1550.74
because yeah there's still these things

1549.24 --> 1553.77
that I want to put out there it's almost

1550.74 --> 1558.69
like until I can finally do that and

1553.77 --> 1565.28
have my yeah 3d CGI modeling thing to

1558.69 --> 1568.5
represent it much more why attack then

1565.28 --> 1570.51
I'm gonna have to resort constantly to

1568.5 --> 1573.21
just explaining it every time havoc

1570.51 --> 1575.43
basic sketches which it which will not

1573.21 --> 1578.45
be a satisfactory to a lot of people

1575.43 --> 1580.5
because yeah my modeling

1578.45 --> 1582.96
conceptualizations are pretty complex

1580.5 --> 1586.68
especially the equate equatorial

1582.96 --> 1596.43
orientation now if I could get some kind

1586.68 --> 1598.8300000000002
of interactive 3d molding system where

1596.43 --> 1602.0700000000002
you could basically have the face the

1598.83 --> 1604.9099999999999
map face of the earth and then through

1602.07 --> 1609.08
specific parameter changes change the

1604.91 --> 1611.78
the orient the projection basically but

1609.08 --> 1617.04
interactively so I could demonstrate

1611.78 --> 1618.57
look this is exactly what it's like when

1617.04 --> 1620.49
the equator is a straight line

1618.57 --> 1622.32
this is what it's like when it's an arc

1620.49 --> 1626.3
this is what it's like when it's a disc

1622.32 --> 1628.8899999999999
so I could literally just do that like

1626.3 --> 1632.04
warp it like this is the direct

1628.89 --> 1634.0200000000002
rectangular looping map as it were the

1632.04 --> 1636.53
known continents in that projection as

1634.02 --> 1641.3899999999999
it were and then that I could warp

1636.53 --> 1645.85
and then yeah close it like that so it

1641.39 --> 1650.51
could literally like a slider you could

1645.85 --> 1656.4099999999999
change the projection from rectangle

1650.51 --> 1663.92
into yeah irregular looping into a disc

1656.41 --> 1668.0
all flat by the way I wish I could yeah

1663.92 --> 1670.5800000000002
I could get like a gadget for that a

1668.0 --> 1675.11
little interactive gadget with a slider

1670.58 --> 1680.74
and maybe well maybe he could do it

1675.11 --> 1680.74
seems to be very competent with CGI so I

1682.27 --> 1687.5
don't know Rob Skiba yeah

1685.52 --> 1692.09
Rob's kiba's been around he's like a

1687.5 --> 1695.14
first Waiver I had some issues with him

1692.09 --> 1698.24
there's definitely issues with him but

1695.14 --> 1703.93
it's still very interesting to follow

1698.24 --> 1707.84
his work but I guess you could say that

1703.93 --> 1709.73
he does adapt he's learning to adapt but

1707.84 --> 1716.6599999999999
he's taking his own very separated

1709.73 --> 1718.73
routes and he's I don't know he keeps he

1716.66 --> 1721.4
is still learning and he does also look

1718.73 --> 1724.43
his own personal principles are kind of

1721.4 --> 1725.93
wise he does realize like yeah you you

1724.43 --> 1729.38
can always be mistaken you can always

1725.93 --> 1731.27
progress and he's he wants empirical

1729.38 --> 1733.42
evidence for things and at the same time

1731.27 --> 1737.0
he's also kind of like trying to follow

1733.42 --> 1741.47
religious Commandments from his

1737.0 --> 1742.72
perspective yeah I think he's a he's a

1741.47 --> 1746.15
good guy

1742.72 --> 1747.68
but I don't think he's perfect it

1746.15 --> 1752.42
doesn't Lee it definitely has human

1747.68 --> 1757.67
flaws and like everybody else his model

1752.42 --> 1760.49
oh you mean the the mechanical setup

1757.67 --> 1763.91
with the real thing yeah he showed that

1760.49 --> 1768.84
pretty early on it's interesting but hey

1763.91 --> 1775.499
it is very physical mechanical and

1768.84 --> 1778.34
it's also of course disc so sure but Tom

1775.499 --> 1781.769
Parker have you ever seen free energies

1778.34 --> 1784.649
model because it is almost kind of the

1781.769 --> 1787.07
same thing but in a different equatorial

1784.649 --> 1791.85
orientation with the looping factor

1787.07 --> 1796.23
it's very alike so that there are there

1791.85 --> 1798.6
are things to all the details that that

1796.23 --> 1801.3890000000001
Rob Skiba has added in his model but

1798.6 --> 1805.23
still there the proof is there's still a

1801.389 --> 1807.2099999999998
lot of presuppositions in it but yeah if

1805.23 --> 1810.84
you want to physically represent

1807.21 --> 1813.779
something it's very tough not to

1810.84 --> 1816.389
presuppose the disk setup because how

1813.779 --> 1824.249
are you gonna you can't you can

1816.389 --> 1827.4189999999999
physically represent a loop see you can

1824.249 --> 1827.419
emulate it in a computer

1832.22 --> 1839.31
[Music]

1835.64 --> 1842.16
all right good servant I yeah thanks I

1839.31 --> 1844.44
thought well I don't necessarily even

1842.16 --> 1846.8100000000002
think if I was all that great yesterday

1844.44 --> 1847.6200000000001
but yes they was for me just a

1846.81 --> 1850.6799999999998
revelation

1847.62 --> 1855.4499999999998
I did something I had to share I even

1850.68 --> 1858.78
told I relayed how I got kind of pissed

1855.45 --> 1861.21
off after the debates were over no more

1858.78 --> 1863.48
recording and I told them like yeah you

1861.21 --> 1866.64
you might think this is all nonsense

1863.48 --> 1869.43
hippie dippie [ __ ] I'm gonna freakin put

1866.64 --> 1873.18
this down on my show and I did as I

1869.43 --> 1878.4
should it is a kind of a personal

1873.18 --> 1882.95
revelation and then and I still stand

1878.4 --> 1885.96
behind it I still experience it it's

1882.95 --> 1890.1000000000001
it's like I can't even really doubt it

1885.96 --> 1892.26
like everything that I feel how

1890.1 --> 1896.34
different it is that I really don't have

1892.26 --> 1900.6299999999999
anymore nausea right which to be fair

1896.34 --> 1902.82
I've been like had a constant little

1900.63 --> 1904.8300000000002
nausea little nothing not a lot thank

1902.82 --> 1908.1599999999999
God but it could grow to more but I've

1904.83 --> 1911.31
had that for like at least a year it had

1908.16 --> 1916.0500000000002
been very slowly growing for a long time

1911.31 --> 1918.6
and I had already in my mind said okay

1916.05 --> 1920.28
this is this is what it's got to be it's

1918.6 --> 1923.1899999999998
gonna get worse it's gonna get really

1920.28 --> 1924.84
terrible when I get older but I'll sit

1923.19 --> 1927.96
through it no matter what I'll go for

1924.84 --> 1930.3899999999999
the very end and now I'm suddenly

1927.96 --> 1934.89
released and it's like mind-blowing to

1930.39 --> 1937.2800000000002
me it is mind-blowing to me and also I

1934.89 --> 1940.0500000000002
can't take too much for granted like

1937.28 --> 1942.66
even though it's been basically said

1940.05 --> 1945.03
like yeah it's never gonna get as that

1942.66 --> 1946.5900000000001
maybe when I'm really old and everything

1945.03 --> 1948.42
starts to falter but then it's gonna

1946.59 --> 1951.48
probably although all the symptoms that

1948.42 --> 1953.52
I had when the chakra was closed are

1951.48 --> 1955.68
going to be secondary to the real old

1953.52 --> 1958.32
age deteriorations but that's gonna be

1955.68 --> 1962.8500000000001
I'm probably gonna get really old now if

1958.32 --> 1964.8899999999999
if the world allows me to that's how it

1962.85 --> 1966.4499999999998
feels is like how can I feel this young

1964.89 --> 1968.22
when I'm 40 and and

1966.45 --> 1971.67
relatively look this young okay and

1968.22 --> 1975.51
people go on oh wait you're getting both

1971.67 --> 1978.39
maybe no it's not it's really not it's

1975.51 --> 1981.27
like my hair how it is now compared to

1978.39 --> 1986.5500000000002
how my dad's hair was at this age it's

1981.27 --> 1991.44
much it's I have different hair I don't

1986.55 --> 1993.93
have like this thick thick curly hair

1991.44 --> 1995.79
that my dad kind of tends to have but

1993.93 --> 1996.42
it's better and I just can't believe

1995.79 --> 1998.49
this

1996.42 --> 2001.22
and I really thought that because of

1998.49 --> 2003.08
this this energy bird in the ceiling

2001.22 --> 2006.89
that I could just never really make it

2003.08 --> 2010.8999999999999
and it's gone I really know it's gone

2006.89 --> 2016.19
and I just have to be careful not to

2010.9 --> 2021.8600000000001
full throttle too much and crash I have

2016.19 --> 2029.48
to be wise be careful don't overestimate

2021.86 --> 2033.8899999999999
myself even right yeah well I'm not bald

2029.48 --> 2038.66
uh to be fair I have a slight very

2033.89 --> 2042.67
slight Baldy spot but it's barely

2038.66 --> 2045.68
anything and it's not getting worse

2042.67 --> 2047.69
see ya you can see a little but they're

2045.68 --> 2049.61
still hairs there it's not like it's

2047.69 --> 2051.89
completely devoid of hair and it's

2049.61 --> 2059.83
nothing left no it's just a little

2051.89 --> 2067.0099999999998
thinner and it's but no get shut up

2059.83 --> 2076.159
never never

2067.01 --> 2077.51
I will die with this hair yeah it is a

2076.159 --> 2080.75
bit of a comb-over

2077.51 --> 2084.32
but even if I loosen it up it's really

2080.75 --> 2090.8
not that extreme it's just not that that

2084.32 --> 2093.679
perfect teenage hair that's all but I'm

2090.8 --> 2098.42
barely balding and it's been like this

2093.679 --> 2100.369
pretty much for for well for 20 years at

2098.42 --> 2102.41
first I thought like oh my god am I

2100.369 --> 2106.579
gonna good but then it just didn't get

2102.41 --> 2110.23
worse and it stayed like that it hasn't

2106.579 --> 2110.23
regressed it really hasn't

2115.95 --> 2125.6699999999996
so that's what it is right yeah it is is

2122.73 --> 2129.39
that so hilarious it's like oh my god

2125.67 --> 2135.15
how dare somebody actually tell the

2129.39 --> 2138.54
public oh no all right

2135.15 --> 2141.299
that'd be come over maybe well look it

2138.54 --> 2143.3089999999997
also depends on like how freshly I've

2141.299 --> 2147.54
washed my hair because I don't wash my

2143.309 --> 2149.099
hair too often it's not healthy but yeah

2147.54 --> 2151.5589999999997
when it's really necessary I do do it

2149.099 --> 2153.3900000000003
but yeah when I've just washed it it

2151.559 --> 2156.69
gets just super fluffy and then it's

2153.39 --> 2161.069
chaos it's very tough it gets all fluffy

2156.69 --> 2163.14
all over the place but when it's like

2161.069 --> 2167.7599999999998
that then I can wear it loose and you

2163.14 --> 2171.24
don't see bald at all and gets a little

2167.76 --> 2173.25
bit more fatty then eventually yeah it

2171.24 --> 2177.54
kind of does a little show it's just

2173.25 --> 2182.13
it's just that I am really confident

2177.54 --> 2186.299
about what I am okay I'm really freaking

2182.13 --> 2187.53
confident you cannot tell me oh my god

2186.299 --> 2192.75
is strike two hides

2187.53 --> 2193.3190000000004
no no not I even I even showed this I'll

2192.75 --> 2196.65
do it

2193.319 --> 2200.089
but because I'm little vain out or get a

2196.65 --> 2200.089
comb to get it problem back

2209.54 --> 2221.49
it's really not ya know I don't have

2215.19 --> 2230.73
hair plugs never had never look sure you

2221.49 --> 2231.33
see it right see oh my god it's I'm so

2230.73 --> 2233.67
bald

2231.33 --> 2234.42
oh my there's so freakin balls it's

2233.67 --> 2241.53
incredible

2234.42 --> 2244.44
Oh No so incredibly balls no oh let's

2241.53 --> 2247.71
see see there's little just there's

2244.44 --> 2250.91
slightly less hair there that's it

2247.71 --> 2253.2
wait aa mirror image is it difficult

2250.91 --> 2256.02
right see

2253.2 --> 2259.0699999999997
so this that's it see there's a little

2256.02 --> 2263.97
just a little see that's not no hair

2259.07 --> 2269.2200000000003
okay and it's been like this for 20

2263.97 --> 2270.1099999999997
years almost well 18 roughly okay that's

2269.22 --> 2276.6299999999997
not bald

2270.11 --> 2277.76
okay I'm very happy I'm 39 and I'm not

2276.63 --> 2281.4900000000002
bald

2277.76 --> 2284.1600000000003
I'm very lucky as men that gets really

2281.49 --> 2286.9199999999996
bald really quickly and it sucks for

2284.16 --> 2289.68
them I've had friends that had that I'm

2286.92 --> 2293.07
fairies yeah what they got over it they

2289.68 --> 2295.8799999999997
they usually just go go and get shave

2293.07 --> 2302.01
heads and then learn to live with that

2295.88 --> 2304.85
but that's aa mirror imaging is very

2302.01 --> 2304.8500000000004
tough this

2307.8 --> 2314.2400000000002
see it's cold I'm gonna get back to

2310.89 --> 2314.24
mayor because it's driving me nuts

2347.95 --> 2359.3799999999997
so yeah Baldwin can yeah can delete his

2354.95 --> 2359.3799999999997
account now because it's just not true

2362.47 --> 2369.5
yeah you're getting a timeout for that I

2365.86 --> 2370.19
know you're just joking still getting a

2369.5 --> 2373.73
timeout

2370.19 --> 2378.65
yeah I'm not it's been like this for a

2373.73 --> 2381.919
very long time and my hair is just great

2378.65 --> 2381.919
[Music]

2397.92 --> 2403.02
maybe I should give designate as a name

2401.58 --> 2404.61
to what I just did

2403.02 --> 2410.43
maybe I should just call this truth

2404.61 --> 2412.59
signaling just opening up showing what

2410.43 --> 2417.39
normally is kept secret and just say

2412.59 --> 2421.38
yeah that is that is real and I'm not

2417.39 --> 2425.49
afraid I'm not really embarrassed

2421.38 --> 2428.1600000000003
because that is how I was designed you

2425.49 --> 2448.74
don't have to be pried bald pride

2428.16 --> 2452.0699999999997
no it's just that yeah I'm not and now

2448.74 --> 2456.06
to be fair I do kind of expect that

2452.07 --> 2460.53
maybe when I get like 60 it will

2456.06 --> 2463.95
probably get a little worse a little but

2460.53 --> 2467.8700000000003
I don't think I'm ever gonna be like

2463.95 --> 2467.87
that bald yeah

2471.15 --> 2475.559
and I don't think by the way that help I

2473.549 --> 2477.21
probably will never really start to wear

2475.559 --> 2480.1400000000003
wigs either that would just be

2477.21 --> 2480.14
ridiculous to me

2498.31 --> 2512.49
yeah Michael rook you can if it's really

2501.369 --> 2512.4900000000002
out of if it's just bad language or spam

2519.68 --> 2535.22
the Prince of Flat Earth what right more

2531.95 --> 2544.2799999999997
colored yeah well I have very thin hair

2535.22 --> 2546.9199999999996
it's yeah I don't know I guess you yeah

2544.28 --> 2554.7200000000003
I guess you could call it like lady hair

2546.92 --> 2557.78
more I don't know I kind of had hair

2554.72 --> 2562.27
like my mother a little she also had

2557.78 --> 2562.27
very thin very fair hair

2566.89 --> 2575.5
but my dad was all oh yeah he even had

2571.3 --> 2582.2200000000003
an afro at some point I think yeah in

2575.5 --> 2584.11
the eighties of course mm man I should

2582.22 --> 2587.41
look up one of those photos that was so

2584.11 --> 2589.81
hilarious to see like my old parent AP

2587.41 --> 2591.8399999999997
photos those it's just amazing to see

2589.81 --> 2591.84
that

2595.6 --> 2598.739
[Music]

2603.93 --> 2610.21
yeah I asked for that yeah I keep on

2607.75 --> 2612.1
saying these things about myself that

2610.21 --> 2614.95
people then immediately just start

2612.1 --> 2618.64
taking as memes it's like that's really

2614.95 --> 2640.81
not my intention but whatever if it

2618.64 --> 2643.3799999999997
inspires you well mark colored look the

2640.81 --> 2647.86
funny thing about really thick hair is

2643.38 --> 2649.9
you can get kind of goofy with it if you

2647.86 --> 2652.69
yeah the problem is if you want to be

2649.9 --> 2654.28
like a serious person regarded like that

2652.69 --> 2656.29
it's gonna be kind of tough but yeah

2654.28 --> 2660.88
with thick hair you can make all kinds

2656.29 --> 2666.16
of sculptures off your hair if you

2660.88 --> 2668.23
wanted to like yeah you could look you

2666.16 --> 2670.27
can make yourself look like Kyle from

2668.23 --> 2673.33
Street Fighter for example if you want

2670.27 --> 2675.46
you can do whatever is so there is an

2673.33 --> 2677.41
advantage to still having air and having

2675.46 --> 2679.48
that thick hair it's not gonna be like

2677.41 --> 2681.25
this it's very tough to get that but you

2679.48 --> 2686.56
can still do a lot of goofy things with

2681.25 --> 2690.37
it if you wanted to and that can be just

2686.56 --> 2693.58
fun I don't know maybe I'm giving you

2690.37 --> 2695.47
like terrible advice now but it is kind

2693.58 --> 2697.7999999999997
of a general advantage of having thicker

2695.47 --> 2700.75
hair is that you can do things with it

2697.8 --> 2706.09
keep it in place and kind of sculpt it

2700.75 --> 2709.3
and a there's like a lot of Africans

2706.09 --> 2712.33
that especially in the Western world

2709.3 --> 2714.96
that that do that and it does look kind

2712.33 --> 2714.96
of interesting

2718.19 --> 2721.19
yeah

2730.369 --> 2733.369
toki

2742.38 --> 2751.2000000000003
right well AGM there is a distinctive

2747.32 --> 2757.5
advantage to having hair and not having

2751.2 --> 2762.24
hair yeah for example it protects your

2757.5 --> 2764.31
head skin a little from some so you

2762.24 --> 2766.7099999999996
don't have to walk around with a hat

2764.31 --> 2769.95
necessarily it's in really sunny places

2766.71 --> 2772.53
probably still better but in general

2769.95 --> 2775.2
yeah it's a little bit helps with that

2772.53 --> 2777.3900000000003
and especially when it's cold oh yeah if

2775.2 --> 2780.27
you're bald-headed and you're like in a

2777.39 --> 2782.9
snowy situation and stuff yeah you're

2780.27 --> 2785.73
gonna brain freeze really quickly hair

2782.9 --> 2788.13
protects that and you can even amplify

2785.73 --> 2789.6
it little by fattening it up yeah

2788.13 --> 2791.9100000000003
fattening up your bald head it's not

2789.6 --> 2793.35
gonna work so you're if you bought

2791.91 --> 2796.0499999999997
you're gonna have to damn well wear a

2793.35 --> 2798.63
cap or you're gonna freeze your you're

2796.05 --> 2804.36
gonna freeze your brain so yeah there is

2798.63 --> 2810.77
advantages to having hair bald is better

2804.36 --> 2810.77
in water I guess it is yes that's true

2814.36 --> 2820.78
because in water hair does tend to just

2817.09 --> 2825.4
be a drag mostly so it'll definitely

2820.78 --> 2827.5600000000004
help with diving that's why all the

2825.4 --> 2836.02
professional swimmers during games

2827.56 --> 2841.56
always have those rubber caps on unless

2836.02 --> 2841.56
they're bald right

2847.88 --> 2852.2200000000003
did we come to talk about this

2868.0 --> 2873.71
in a way I'm kind of lucky that I still

2871.07 --> 2877.4900000000002
have my hair I can barely imagine what

2873.71 --> 2881.03
it would be like to like for me

2877.49 --> 2885.3199999999997
specifically okay not in general because

2881.03 --> 2886.9700000000003
then if I were bald then I would either

2885.32 --> 2889.9700000000003
have to be walking around like some

2886.97 --> 2892.2799999999997
weird black dressed buddhist which is

2889.97 --> 2896.5099999999998
weird that's kind of what it would start

2892.28 --> 2901.09
to look like or with a mustache it's

2896.51 --> 2903.32
gonna be weird yeah people could yeah

2901.09 --> 2906.4700000000003
yeah yeah it probably wouldn't be good

2903.32 --> 2911.9300000000003
or I would have to wear a hat

2906.47 --> 2916.0
yeah oh that's gonna help right no so

2911.93 --> 2916.0
I'm really happy to have my hair

2931.91 --> 2937.759
IIIi got look I got good organic

2934.789 --> 2940.5490000000004
products for my skin in my hair too so

2937.759 --> 2944.829
don't worry about that I I've stepped

2940.549 --> 2948.38
away from like the deodorant crap

2944.829 --> 2955.809
Wow a long time ago last time I used

2948.38 --> 2961.4300000000003
deodorant was I think when I was 19

2955.809 --> 2963.5
yeah that's very early on there and Wow

2961.43 --> 2965.21
did I turn out to make the right choice

2963.5 --> 2966.259
I didn't even know there was aluminum in

2965.21 --> 2968.509
and all that in the [ __ ]

2966.259 --> 2970.4
I just stepped away from it because I

2968.509 --> 2972.89
knew like every time I used that [ __ ]

2970.4 --> 2977.059
I'm gonna be more stinky afterward

2972.89 --> 2982.0989999999997
literally and when I stopped it stopped

2977.059 --> 2984.289
and now I also started to step away from

2982.099 --> 2986.5
literally going under the shower every

2984.289 --> 2989.809
day because that didn't help either and

2986.5 --> 2993.019
I started to get my own tradition that I

2989.809 --> 2996.1400000000003
actually got inspired by from some weird

2993.019 --> 2997.7589999999996
do you think it's so odd I how that came

2996.14 --> 3000.819
to me but I just knew it this is what I

2997.759 --> 3004.359
got to do wash my feet wash my feet

3000.819 --> 3009.099
every night before going to sleep hot

3004.359 --> 3016.089
water and that's perfect and I have no

3009.099 --> 3017.619
smell issues like zero I think like dogs

3016.089 --> 3018.22
and everything cans of course still

3017.619 --> 3023.23
smell me

3018.22 --> 3027.8799999999997
but I've never had smell complaints from

3023.23 --> 3030.069
anyone like from me personally like

3027.88 --> 3032.829
maybe yeah my room if I don't clean it

3030.069 --> 3040.69
up long enough yeah it might get you

3032.829 --> 3042.819
know but from my personal body no and

3040.69 --> 3045.2200000000003
that was very early on and then later I

3042.819 --> 3049.8089999999997
started to eat organic and stepped away

3045.22 --> 3052.89
from the MSG stuff and all that and that

3049.809 --> 3052.8900000000003
helped it even further

3055.65 --> 3063.19
so that was around 2006 when it started

3061.21 --> 3065.26
to do that when it really went for it

3063.19 --> 3067.63
it's also because I kind of had

3065.26 --> 3070.2700000000004
financial opportunity I guess because my

3067.63 --> 3072.79
mother had died and certainly a girl the

3070.27 --> 3075.52
whole house was sold and yeah was time

3072.79 --> 3077.62
of chaos for me but also I got a lot of

3075.52 --> 3080.56
money so I couldn't cut I was very

3077.62 --> 3082.0
fearful first but it just thought no I'm

3080.56 --> 3085.83
gonna do this and see if it has

3082.0 --> 3090.46
empirical results and it did very very

3085.83 --> 3094.5099999999998
noticeably so and so I stuck to it I

3090.46 --> 3097.0
started to eat less needed less food so

3094.51 --> 3100.5400000000004
it evened out the money that I spent on

3097.0 --> 3105.88
food eventually even out and I started

3100.54 --> 3108.37
to stop drinking carbon drinks like with

3105.88 --> 3112.96
the with bubbles in it why except for

3108.37 --> 3117.3399999999997
beer that's like the only bubbly drink I

3112.96 --> 3119.56
ever drink things like coca-cola and all

3117.34 --> 3121.27
that all stepped away from that and even

3119.56 --> 3123.64
the organic versions I stepped away from

3121.27 --> 3128.35
the organic versions as well that was

3123.64 --> 3130.72
all around 2006 up until 2008 when full

3128.35 --> 3133.2999999999997
organic started to make more of my own

3130.72 --> 3136.3599999999997
food and that's well that's the

3133.3 --> 3139.48
beginning of my learning about about

3136.36 --> 3141.7000000000003
health good looked into natural news a

3139.48 --> 3143.92
lot learned a lot about plants and like

3141.7 --> 3147.85
how nutrition works and things that were

3143.92 --> 3150.88
being discovered and cannabis also helps

3147.85 --> 3154.81
against cancer in certain ways all of

3150.88 --> 3162.1
that came in there during that period I

3154.81 --> 3163.9
learned so much yeah the space exists

3162.1 --> 3167.38
because technically it could still exist

3163.9 --> 3169.6800000000003
with the dome container right no no it

3167.38 --> 3169.6800000000003
cannot

3170.849 --> 3178.809
now it yeah it defined the depends on

3177.009 --> 3181.089
what you're gonna define a space if you

3178.809 --> 3187.809
mean there's more room up there sure

3181.089 --> 3191.2
that can be fast distance fast much more

3187.809 --> 3194.2000000000003
fast than we can reach I don't know but

3191.2 --> 3197.259
it could be something within that space

3194.2 --> 3200.8289999999997
is naturally even obstructing further

3197.259 --> 3203.89
ascension but that doesn't mean that

3200.829 --> 3206.65
that is literally the end of it it just

3203.89 --> 3209.589
means there's something preventing from

3206.65 --> 3213.2490000000003
further ascension visit like spatial

3209.589 --> 3215.589
ascension there could be more room there

3213.249 --> 3217.3289999999997
and then we couldn't get there somehow

3215.589 --> 3219.7889999999998
it doesn't mean that that is the end of

3217.329 --> 3221.289
the container that is what everybody's

3219.789 --> 3223.2990000000004
oh like oh we're being blocked that

3221.289 --> 3225.5490000000004
means container because container we

3223.299 --> 3227.559
have to emphasize container because

3225.549 --> 3229.15
we're trying to counter psychological

3227.559 --> 3232.779
warfare after ballers yeah I get that

3229.15 --> 3237.009
but I'm trying to get stay real and just

3232.779 --> 3240.22
say no that that's not really proof of a

3237.009 --> 3242.98
barrier yet some kind of conditions in

3240.22 --> 3244.839
there every confrontation that as that

3242.98 --> 3247.96
seems to be kind of like a deflection

3244.839 --> 3251.17
thing or barrier it doesn't seem to be

3247.96 --> 3253.029
physical so far almost like there's a

3251.17 --> 3254.279
force field somewhere and that's very

3253.029 --> 3256.539
interesting

3254.279 --> 3259.989
there's just no signs that there is an

3256.539 --> 3263.4700000000003
actual physical obstruction where things

3259.989 --> 3266.799
have been stopped when tested by humans

3263.47 --> 3269.049
so far doesn't mean that there isn't at

3266.799 --> 3270.369
any point it just seems that we haven't

3269.049 --> 3275.339
been able to reach that because

3270.369 --> 3275.339
something else may be in the way yeah

3277.369 --> 3284.099
but there is no vacuum outer space that

3281.15 --> 3289.9500000000003
cannot exist especially in the scale

3284.099 --> 3292.05
that it is being told to us and the

3289.95 --> 3294.18
likelihood that at some point there is

3292.05 --> 3297.7200000000003
no more relative density as we know it

3294.18 --> 3300.93
is also very very slim but yeah because

3297.72 --> 3303.3289999999997
we don't really understand why the

3300.93 --> 3305.8799999999997
polarized alignment as it were within

3303.329 --> 3309.98
the relative density concept what

3305.88 --> 3314.609
ballers love to say but that is gravity

3309.98 --> 3316.98
and other flat earthers like for example

3314.609 --> 3321.93
Bob from globe Buster says no that is

3316.98 --> 3324.66
the electrostatic thing sorry I the

3321.93 --> 3329.43
changes the way he says it but that is

3324.66 --> 3333.1189999999997
especially that right well who knows if

3329.43 --> 3335.43
Bob would be sorta right or maybe

3333.119 --> 3338.2200000000003
partially right that is actually the

3335.43 --> 3339.8689999999997
nature as to why the alignment of the

3338.22 --> 3343.5299999999997
relative density Theory within the realm

3339.869 --> 3347.4300000000003
then who knows at some point that no

3343.53 --> 3350.6400000000003
longer works because of what fuels that

3347.43 --> 3353.1189999999997
polarization may simply have different

3350.64 --> 3356.39
workings and who knows maybe that

3353.119 --> 3360.27
barrier we keep bumping into is like a

3356.39 --> 3364.74
side effect of it it's kind of ironic

3360.27 --> 3368.97
because from within the global

3364.74 --> 3371.3999999999996
perspective I kind of played with the

3368.97 --> 3373.7099999999996
concepts and said oh but maybe there's a

3371.4 --> 3376.29
container through a secondary gravity

3373.71 --> 3379.23
barrier like a force field side effect

3376.29 --> 3382.609
of this gravity that was a joke and even

3379.23 --> 3385.109
rumpus has kind of been taking that joke

3382.609 --> 3385.71
because yeah what what else can they do

3385.109 --> 3389.46
right

3385.71 --> 3391.53
but maybe whatever actually is causing

3389.46 --> 3395.51
the alignment within the relative

3391.53 --> 3402.69
density might ironically actually have

3395.51 --> 3407.34
that secondary barrier effect I don't

3402.69 --> 3410.4
know it could be could be

3407.34 --> 3413.73
but yeah whatever is outside of that

3410.4 --> 3418.44
barrier I don't know if that is water or

3413.73 --> 3420.54
if it is more gas and that there's some

3418.44 --> 3422.52
other type of barrier beyond that I

3420.54 --> 3427.11
don't know I don't know even what that

3422.52 --> 3434.07
is how that works what we think we've

3427.11 --> 3436.7400000000002
been bumping into as for the general gas

3434.07 --> 3438.3900000000003
pressure in this realm well there has to

3436.74 --> 3442.1099999999997
be a container one way or the other

3438.39 --> 3447.3199999999997
whether it be that barrier whether it be

3442.11 --> 3450.2400000000002
the total spatial limits of the realm

3447.32 --> 3451.8900000000003
there is going to be a limited amount of

3450.24 --> 3453.6899999999996
space there is going to be a container

3451.89 --> 3457.6099999999997
because we have gas pressure it has to

3453.69 --> 3460.4900000000002
be because the gas pressure is here

3457.61 --> 3463.7400000000002
so anyway I'm gonna round out the show

3460.49 --> 3465.24

please also do support me through the

3474.03 --> 3479.67
paypal patreon my GoFundMe and super

3475.86 --> 3482.46
chats and thank you earlier for the the

3479.67 --> 3484.25
North's cronin super chat donation that

3482.46 --> 3486.78
wasn't that was interesting thank you

3484.25 --> 3490.97
doctor how much it is it doesn't matter

3486.78 --> 3493.5600000000004
anyway yeah hashtag meifa indeed and

3490.97 --> 3493.7099999999996
yeah i will be back tomorrow with Flat

3493.56 --> 3496.95
Earth

3493.71 --> 3499.02
early-bird number 395 and I'm gonna join

3496.95 --> 3502.02
the Flat Earth debates right now which

3499.02 --> 3509.48
is already started up so until the next

3502.02 --> 3509.48
video keep it flat

3509.81 --> 3532.75
[Music]

3535.39 --> 3537.45
you
