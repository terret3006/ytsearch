48.719 --> 53.6
good morning welcome to flat earth early

that would be much appreciated

83.52 --> 87.31
so yeah the weather today is really

86.64 --> 88.64
different

87.31 --> 91.68
[Music]

88.64 --> 95.43900000000001
it's completely gray covered and it's

91.68 --> 95.43900000000001
really really moist

95.92 --> 101.36
and it's colder

98.96 --> 103.119
it's i don't really know what to make of

101.36 --> 105.92
this weather

103.119 --> 108.24
it's just such a big difference from

105.92 --> 112.24000000000001
yesterday

108.24 --> 115.759
it's also wind still on top of that

112.24 --> 119.52
it's just

115.759 --> 121.2
yeah turn around

119.52 --> 125.03999999999999
although i think that this type of

121.2 --> 125.04
weather is probably really good for the

126.84 --> 132.64000000000001
plants

129.679 --> 132.959
it's not too great for me i think that

132.64 --> 135.92
the

132.959 --> 138.08
weather changed yeah i got issues with

135.92 --> 143.83999999999997
my jaw again

138.08 --> 143.84
pretty much all night

148.879 --> 158.07999999999998
so yeah i'm a little distracted yeah

156.239 --> 160.16
every time man i keep hoping like oh

158.08 --> 162.48000000000002
it's gone it's gonna stay gone next day

160.16 --> 166.07999999999998
comes back day after oh it's gone it's

162.48 --> 166.07999999999998
gone and next day come back it's

168.84 --> 173.44
weird

171.36 --> 175.20000000000002
at least it's just not continual that

173.44 --> 179.44
that would be really

175.2 --> 183.2
aggravating right anyway

179.44 --> 187.12
it is saturday the 19th

183.2 --> 187.11999999999998
of june 2021

189.04 --> 194.4
doing a one-hour show today maybe longer

194.879 --> 199.44
also depends on if it's what's gonna

197.519 --> 200.87900000000002
happen with that seems to be residing a

199.44 --> 204.0
little

200.879 --> 207.12
so who knows maybe at in an hour's time

204.0 --> 207.12
i'll feel a lot better

208.56 --> 215.04
i wonder if the vibration from my voice

211.36 --> 215.04000000000002
actually kind of soothes it

218.0 --> 222.0
it's weird it doesn't make it worse at

220.4 --> 227.84
least anyway

222.0 --> 227.84
hello first in chat

232.56 --> 235.76
got green tea here

236.72 --> 242.879
still a little hot

239.84 --> 242.879
right so yesterday

244.64 --> 248.319
uh flat earth debates

252.08 --> 255.84
it was quite intense

258.239 --> 264.63899999999995
was there the first half and

261.44 --> 266.88
at the last part of the

264.639 --> 269.84000000000003
after show because i was doing groceries

266.88 --> 271.36
in between

269.84 --> 274.32
and that took a while because it was

271.36 --> 274.32
really hot then

277.84 --> 284.63899999999995
right also yeah great at talk after

281.12 --> 289.84000000000003
and yeah the the game that i anticipated

284.639 --> 289.84000000000003
scotland versus england

290.16 --> 297.84000000000003
it was yeah it was an interesting match

293.52 --> 297.84
i'd hope for a little more but yeah

298.639 --> 303.36
state zero zero but it was interesting

301.039 --> 303.36
enough

304.08 --> 308.479
and i enjoyed that simultaneously with

307.039 --> 311.84
adam meekin

308.479 --> 311.84
over skype

313.759 --> 320.24
right uh also yeah i watched that movie

317.039 --> 323.28
that was recommended to me

320.24 --> 325.84000000000003
memento momentum what was it again

323.28 --> 325.84
exactly

327.84 --> 337.11999999999995
yeah memento from 2000

333.759 --> 338.96000000000004
i've never never seen that before

337.12 --> 341.039
and it was yeah it was like a

338.96 --> 342.96
psychological art piece

341.039 --> 345.84
it was really interesting about a guy

342.96 --> 348.32
that didn't really have any memory

345.84 --> 349.52
and they really tried to portray in a

348.32 --> 352.479
way

349.52 --> 354.08
that you would get what it's like for

352.479 --> 356.08
that guy

354.08 --> 357.68
because you basically got to see the

356.08 --> 361.44
entire movie backwards

357.68 --> 365.12
it's just one scene then

361.44 --> 366.8
the previous scene leading up to that

365.12 --> 368.4
then the previous scene leading up to

366.8 --> 371.039
that but

368.4 --> 371.59999999999997
not only that but also flashbacks from

371.039 --> 373.12
the guy

371.6 --> 376.96000000000004
in those moments so it got a little

373.12 --> 376.96
confusing especially at first but

377.12 --> 384.24
also it is kind of depressing

380.88 --> 387.36
i thought it's really a tough movie

384.24 --> 390.72
but it was interesting

387.36 --> 394.56
and yeah kind of like what i expected

390.72 --> 396.96000000000004
and it's where it ended up

394.56 --> 398.0
because i i got a hint very early on

396.96 --> 402.08
that this guy

398.0 --> 402.96
is very confused and then you find out

402.08 --> 406.08
why

402.96 --> 409.12
so i'm not gonna spoil that but it was

406.08 --> 414.24
very yeah psychologically interesting

409.12 --> 414.24
piece anyway

414.88 --> 418.639
and after that it kind of went a bit

421.199 --> 424.479
okay what are you saying it's on your

424.0 --> 428.08
dome

424.479 --> 428.08
today uh

432.08 --> 438.71999999999997
vocabulary of the firmament

435.28 --> 442.479
and the cranium okay

438.72 --> 442.47900000000004
i don't see the connection but sure

444.88 --> 451.12
right stevie traveler yet it is kind of

448.84 --> 453.19899999999996
tough

451.12 --> 454.72
well it wasn't tough for me

453.199 --> 458.639
intellectually

454.72 --> 460.47900000000004
to keep track because i just saw a whole

458.639 --> 463.199
bunch of things coming

460.479 --> 465.28
i don't know it's just that as soon as

463.199 --> 467.12
you start to scroll back a couple of

465.28 --> 468.15999999999997
times then you see what's happening how

467.12 --> 470.319
the guy sees it

468.16 --> 471.84000000000003
and how he's likely mistaken about so

470.319 --> 473.03900000000004
many things and now he's basically

471.84 --> 476.31899999999996
ending up in

473.039 --> 479.599
a spiral of complete confusion

476.319 --> 482.879
based on the hints he gave himself

479.599 --> 483.599
and others gave him it's re it's such a

482.879 --> 486.639
puzzle but

483.599 --> 491.44
i was able to keep track pretty good

486.639 --> 494.72
but beside that it is also depressing

491.44 --> 497.039
in a way like the guy is not really

494.72 --> 499.28000000000003
having a good time

497.039 --> 501.919
although his memory loss seems to keep

499.28 --> 505.599
him in kind of like a neutral position

501.919 --> 508.96
but he knows about his condition and

505.599 --> 511.36
yeah in a way it's kind of a tragic

508.96 --> 513.039
movie like that

511.36 --> 515.6800000000001
it's just that the guy doesn't seem to

513.039 --> 517.919
be actively down by it

515.68 --> 520.0
but that's also probably because of the

517.919 --> 523.519
condition it's just

520.0 --> 523.919
it's it's a pretty complicated movie but

523.519 --> 526.64
i did

523.919 --> 526.64
appreciate it

530.399 --> 534.08
we refer to the skull and the firmness

532.959 --> 536.959
as a dome

534.08 --> 536.9590000000001
okay okay

539.44 --> 545.6
all right like that i get it now

543.2 --> 546.88
yeah cipher from the matrix not only

545.6 --> 549.839
cipher

546.88 --> 553.12
also trinity you were a whole bunch of

549.839 --> 553.12
matrix crew in there

554.88 --> 558.0
like cypher and matrix pretty much

556.88 --> 563.8389999999999
played the

558.0 --> 563.839
the lead secondary roles in it

574.839 --> 577.839
so

585.12 --> 591.839
no never heard of that

588.64 --> 591.8389999999999
sounds interesting

592.56 --> 595.04
let's see

602.839 --> 605.839
2020

616.839 --> 619.839
okay

624.48 --> 633.839
right so that's a reason movie

635.36 --> 639.36
did you notice the color scenes were in

637.92 --> 647.8389999999999
reverse yeah

639.36 --> 647.839
and the black and white forward yes

658.839 --> 661.839
so

664.16 --> 667.8389999999999
right yeah that that difference that

666.8 --> 672.56
started to

667.839 --> 672.5600000000001
i started to really notice notice that

672.839 --> 675.839
when

675.92 --> 680.64
yeah when the scene started to meet i

678.88 --> 684.48
think halfway somewhere else and then i

680.64 --> 684.48
started to see like that pattern yes

685.44 --> 692.32
december oh matrix four

690.0 --> 692.32
all right

695.279 --> 699.6
then five and six oh jesus really

701.36 --> 705.6
all right so they got a whole thing

703.12 --> 705.6
planned

707.2 --> 709.6800000000001
all right

711.92 --> 716.079
okay well that means at least they got

713.76 --> 716.079
like a

719.76 --> 723.279
trilogy setup

723.6 --> 728.0
so wonder yeah are they going to

726.399 --> 732.16
basically completely

728.0 --> 732.16
repeat the old format

732.56 --> 736.2399999999999
like has been done with star wars and

734.959 --> 739.76
all that

736.24 --> 742.839
the re the newer ones it's pretty much

739.76 --> 744.639
playbook of the old thing like that's

742.839 --> 747.6800000000001
even

744.639 --> 750.0
generally recognized and complained

747.68 --> 750.0
about

751.839 --> 755.6800000000001
so i wonder if if this is going to be

754.0 --> 758.88
something really new

755.68 --> 761.1999999999999
that would continue it or

758.88 --> 762.959
if it's basically going to be some kind

761.2 --> 766.0
of a reboot with it

762.959 --> 767.1199999999999
within the same universe which is kind

766.0 --> 769.92
of hilarious because

767.12 --> 773.839
things reboot literally in there so who

769.92 --> 773.8389999999999
knows what they're going to do with it

777.279 --> 782.959
i don't know man maybe it'll be halfway

779.44 --> 782.9590000000001
decent you never really know

784.88 --> 787.8389999999999
uh

788.8 --> 794.24
okay yeah but maybe i will have a look

790.959 --> 794.2399999999999
up this tenant

794.56 --> 801.8389999999999
might already be available

811.92 --> 828.639
yeah yeah it is

815.839 --> 832.0790000000001
all right

828.639 --> 832.0790000000001
all right wait no no

838.88 --> 843.8389999999999
thanks for the tip i i hope this is

841.12 --> 843.839
going to be good

850.56 --> 855.3599999999999
matrix inside the matrix well yeah that

853.04 --> 858.24
was my idea tomonoid

855.36 --> 858.24
hello by the way

860.8 --> 865.76
well my idea i think a whole bunch of

863.92 --> 868.24
people that like the matrix probably

865.76 --> 871.519
came up with that

868.24 --> 875.519
i even wrote a tiny little script

871.519 --> 877.519
rough script for it more like a script

875.519 --> 879.92
guide

877.519 --> 881.04
for an idea of a continuation years ago

879.92 --> 883.92
i think even like

881.04 --> 883.92
is it two thousand

893.04 --> 897.4399999999999
right and my idea was based that neo

895.519 --> 901.04
would basically be

897.44 --> 905.36
reborn and that he would kind of like

901.04 --> 905.36
try to find the actual exit

907.199 --> 912.4799999999999
right and who knows how you could look

910.16 --> 915.519
tie that in such a loop

912.48 --> 918.0
with the older movies and all that

915.519 --> 918.9590000000001
it's like just find the exit like the

918.0 --> 922.0
real exit

918.959 --> 924.079
it's really tough

922.0 --> 925.04
and might lead to like i don't know they

924.079 --> 927.04
could

925.04 --> 928.24
put some kind of a weird time

927.04 --> 929.92
cancellation loop

928.24 --> 931.92
in there that if you would do that that

929.92 --> 932.88
it would all never happen or something i

931.92 --> 935.199
don't know

932.88 --> 937.279
it was kind of superficially thought out

935.199 --> 939.519
of me

937.279 --> 942.88
but just the idea of like trying to find

939.519 --> 945.92
the exit to the matrix

942.88 --> 947.519
because even like the machine world and

945.92 --> 950.24
the

947.519 --> 952.48
zion was basically would have been

950.24 --> 956.0
another matrix layer

952.48 --> 960.24
maybe like an end version

956.0 --> 963.36
in the spectrum like a simulation

960.24 --> 968.48
of what would be right

963.36 --> 971.44
because it's all never happened not yet

968.48 --> 974.0790000000001
if he reaches the beginning basically

971.44 --> 975.6800000000001
which would be the real exit

974.079 --> 977.92
i don't know i i had a pretty

975.68 --> 979.68
psychedelic idea about it

977.92 --> 981.04
i wonder what they're gonna do with it

979.68 --> 983.279
and if they're look if they're gonna

981.04 --> 986.8
make it like a

983.279 --> 988.56
quantum leap a series they're gonna make

986.8 --> 990.4799999999999
it like that then it's just gonna end up

988.56 --> 994.2399999999999
completely nonsensical

990.48 --> 997.6800000000001
but if they really thought it out

994.24 --> 998.8
could be quite good anyway yeah i'm i'm

997.68 --> 1001.04
curious as what the

998.8 --> 1002.0
the story is going to be like in the

1001.04 --> 1011.8389999999999
matrix

1002.0 --> 1011.839
4 and the rest of them

1013.04 --> 1016.639
bends two spoons at once well look

1015.759 --> 1018.72
terminoid

1016.639 --> 1021.6
like by the logic of matrix in the

1018.72 --> 1026.64
matrix in the matrix

1021.6 --> 1026.64
then potentially the the like the one

1027.839 --> 1035.039
the the one fractal like fr yeah

1031.679 --> 1037.2800000000002
one in all the one and all right

1035.039 --> 1038.079
would potentially be able to be in one

1037.28 --> 1041.52
matrix and

1038.079 --> 1044.3999999999999
literally through his mind influence

1041.52 --> 1046.559
things happening on another layer or on

1044.4 --> 1047.52
on previous layers of the matrix or

1046.559 --> 1050.8799999999999
something

1047.52 --> 1054.24

bit of a joke back again

1293.039 --> 1296.32
it's very distracting

1298.0 --> 1301.12
but it's not really terrible it's just

1300.159 --> 1305.8400000000001
really annoying

whether i'm hot or cold with this

1308.559 --> 1312.24
weather it's

1309.6 --> 1312.24
just weird

1315.679 --> 1333.8400000000001
i think i maybe should put on longer

1317.679 --> 1333.8400000000001
pants or something

1344.84 --> 1353.6
just

1347.2 --> 1353.6000000000001

1360.0 --> 1365.12
curious to hear that

most people find me through nathan

1365.12 --> 1367.52
oakley

1368.72 --> 1389.84
but maybe you heard about me somewhere

1372.84 --> 1389.84
else all busters

1400.84 --> 1406.08
hmm

1402.4 --> 1409.679

i'm gonna put on some pants

1409.679 --> 1417.8400000000001

okay

1456.84 --> 1459.84
uh

1462.159 --> 1473.8400000000001
all right yeah that's somewhat bad

1479.279 --> 1481.679
all right

1499.2 --> 1515.8400000000001
hair follicles trees of vegetation

1524.96 --> 1529.8400000000001
so a zr 1fc

1530.08 --> 1534.6399999999999
i kind of expect an answer i want to

1533.279 --> 1543.84
know how you

1534.64 --> 1543.8400000000001
found me

1544.88 --> 1550.0
you don't have to tell anything about

1547.919 --> 1552.0800000000002
yourself

1550.0 --> 1553.919
or anything i just want to know how you

1552.08 --> 1557.84
found my channel

1553.919 --> 1557.8400000000001
because that doesn't happen a lot

1558.0 --> 1564.559
as you can tell from the amount of

1561.44 --> 1564.559
subscribers i got

1566.72 --> 1571.84
with the amount of shows that i've done

1578.02 --> 1581.1399999999999
[Music]

1582.84 --> 1585.84
so

1610.84 --> 1613.84

uh

1648.08 --> 1655.84
okay fine

1670.64 --> 1677.44
so uh zl1 fc could you

1673.919 --> 1677.44
explain perhaps why

1681.6 --> 1698.6399999999999
why what did i ever do to you

1696.88 --> 1700.7990000000002
or are you just one of these people

1698.64 --> 1701.279
that's angry against the entire world

1700.799 --> 1704.799
and you're

1701.279 --> 1707.36
just looking for some kind of a target

1704.799 --> 1708.6399999999999
you feel would be justified to attack

1707.36 --> 1711.84
attack for no reason

1708.64 --> 1711.8400000000001
is that it

1717.12 --> 1725.84
oh okay it wasn't you

1728.32 --> 1734.32
really did you nah do people really do

1736.84 --> 1742.799
that

1739.12 --> 1745.12
like holy [ __ ] i must have really

1742.799 --> 1746.559
migrated in their heads i know i've been

1745.12 --> 1749.039
kind of like

1746.559 --> 1750.08
when that came up i'd be like yeah yeah

1749.039 --> 1753.76
i'll get in there

1750.08 --> 1756.08
i even know how to effectively do that

1753.76 --> 1759.279
but i guess i really got stuck in some

1756.08 --> 1759.279
people's heads somehow

1764.84 --> 1767.84
damn

1790.88 --> 1794.159
all right so zero one fc do you know

1793.84 --> 1796.799
about

1794.159 --> 1796.7990000000002
flat earth

1798.799 --> 1802.08
you must have seen the title of the show

1800.64 --> 1805.1200000000001
by now

1802.08 --> 1805.6
like you just heard some random guys

1805.12 --> 1809.52
sing

1805.6 --> 1812.8799999999999
or you actually know some of

1809.52 --> 1815.2
things that are going down what has

1812.88 --> 1816.0
has been discussed in the last five

1815.2 --> 1823.8400000000001
years

1816.0 --> 1823.84
on the internet do you know

1833.52 --> 1837.52
hi guys don't worry i think well i don't

1836.88 --> 1842.24
know

1837.52 --> 1842.24
you know if he if he only knows

1842.399 --> 1846.399
things that indirectly kind of like

1844.799 --> 1848.8799999999999
attempt to

1846.399 --> 1849.52
bully or make fun of me if that's all he

1848.88 --> 1852.88
knows

1849.52 --> 1856.72
yeah then he is a troll but if he

1852.88 --> 1857.679
just is a real person then we'll notice

1856.72 --> 1860.159
by him

1857.679 --> 1861.039
saying things that real persons would

1860.159 --> 1865.3600000000001
say

1861.039 --> 1868.96
and not trolls right

1865.36 --> 1868.9599999999998
that's why i'm asking questions

1873.279 --> 1879.84
hey clutch bear

1890.84 --> 1893.84
so

1904.84 --> 1907.84
uh

1960.84 --> 1963.84
okay

1972.03 --> 1975.23
[Music]

1978.559 --> 1982.0
i'm in the land of the lost

1982.24 --> 1986.96
oh no don't go squirting now

1988.96 --> 1994.32
but yeah canada it's it's pretty grim

1995.36 --> 2005.84
but in a way so is england

2030.84 --> 2033.84
hmm

2040.799 --> 2047.2
yeah guns never yeah

2044.0 --> 2051.359
it seems like we got a lot of canadians

2047.2 --> 2054.8
in chat today uh

2051.359 --> 2056.72
but yeah trudeau is a disaster

2054.8 --> 2061.8390000000004
like that guy is completely whacked out

2056.72 --> 2061.839
of his mind

2100.839 --> 2103.839
okay

2115.2 --> 2119.68
yeah i got to now run good good to have

2117.119 --> 2119.6800000000003
you here

2125.839 --> 2128.96
i'm a little distracted though so this

2127.68 --> 2130.56
is not gonna

2128.96 --> 2132.2400000000002
turn out to be the best show i've ever

2130.56 --> 2137.52
had

2132.24 --> 2137.52
let's get a little nagging from my jaw

2139.92 --> 2145.839
i feel like little fatigue from it too

2142.24 --> 2145.839
because i had it all night

2146.24 --> 2159.839
i got trouble sleeping

2177.44 --> 2182.48
did you get an extra no

2180.56 --> 2183.599
no i don't dude i don't even have a

2182.48 --> 2185.599
doctor

2183.599 --> 2187.04
i haven't gone to the dentist since my

2185.599 --> 2190.32
ex

2187.04 --> 2195.599
this is now geez

2190.32 --> 2197.76
is it damn eight years ago

2195.599 --> 2197.76
so

2199.76 --> 2204.1600000000003
but i'm i'm pretty s certain as to

2202.4 --> 2214.48
what's going on here there's nothing

2204.16 --> 2217.44
like out of con this is just something

2214.48 --> 2219.68
all right the way i see it eventually

2217.44 --> 2222.16
i'll have to do something about it or

2219.68 --> 2223.359
my body will manage to fix all of it

2222.16 --> 2226.16
it's going to be painful

2223.359 --> 2229.839
periodically yeah we'll be mad we'll be

2226.16 --> 2229.839
able to fix it

2230.8 --> 2235.6800000000003
not even for teeth i don't need no not

2233.359 --> 2235.68
really

2238.0 --> 2243.04
i don't seem to have much what you call

2240.64 --> 2243.04
it like

2244.24 --> 2249.52
the chalky type stuff build up i don't

2246.64 --> 2249.52
have that anymore

2252.88 --> 2257.28
so and i clean my teeth very carefully i

2255.52 --> 2258.48
have done that for a long time because i

2257.28 --> 2261.6800000000003
vote like have

2258.48 --> 2261.68
had a lot of issues

2262.079 --> 2265.76
right so like a couple of years ago it

2264.8 --> 2268.96
was this

2265.76 --> 2270.079
side on at the at the top lots of issue

2268.96 --> 2273.44
that hasn't played

2270.079 --> 2278.8
up at all during this whole thing

2273.44 --> 2278.8
it's just down here

2280.96 --> 2287.44
black is that called black right

2284.079 --> 2287.44
well that it's not bad

2287.52 --> 2291.52
right besides most of that really builds

2289.92 --> 2294.88
up at the front

2291.52 --> 2298.16
i never have issues hurting teeth

2294.88 --> 2301.119
at the front thank god by the way so

2298.16 --> 2301.1189999999997
it's always in the back

2304.16 --> 2314.0789999999997
so i'll lift through it

2312.24 --> 2316.24
i just have to be kind of careful as to

2314.079 --> 2320.1600000000003
what i eat because that has a lot of

2316.24 --> 2320.16
influence as i recently discovered

2322.32 --> 2328.96
that like uh cheese sauce

2326.72 --> 2330.3199999999997
like with milk in it which would have

2328.96 --> 2332.56
been heated

2330.32 --> 2334.88
or it would be heated that that's

2332.56 --> 2338.24
actually really

2334.88 --> 2340.2400000000002
has a big negative impact

2338.24 --> 2341.9199999999996
on the nerves there and i got yeah

2340.24 --> 2343.2799999999997
that's happened before and now i

2341.92 --> 2345.119
remembered it again

2343.28 --> 2346.96
and i even kind of tested it like one

2345.119 --> 2349.28
day lasagna

2346.96 --> 2351.52
next day it hurt that day i don't need

2349.28 --> 2353.599
lasagna today after it doesn't hurt

2351.52 --> 2355.28
then i eat lasagna again immediately it

2353.599 --> 2358.0
hurts again until i stopped

2355.28 --> 2359.28
so that's like and then i finally tested

2358.0 --> 2362.24
it with

2359.28 --> 2364.5600000000004
just spaghetti without the sauce and

2362.24 --> 2367.04
nothing happened

2364.56 --> 2367.599
so yeah i know but it's not the sole

2367.04 --> 2370.88
cause

2367.599 --> 2372.56
of when it happens it's also extreme

2370.88 --> 2376.32
weather change which is

2372.56 --> 2376.32
exactly what's happening right now

2381.28 --> 2386.0
yeah it's 90 degrees celsius so that

2383.68 --> 2388.3999999999996
went down

2386.0 --> 2391.359
10 degrees it's a pretty dramatic

2388.4 --> 2391.359
temperature change

2393.28 --> 2398.48
much more by the way than they even

2394.8 --> 2398.48
predicted on the weather i think

2408.96 --> 2413.44
hey good servant and he fell asleep

2413.68 --> 2427.44
yeah i started just a little late

2424.4 --> 2431.119
if i take ten evil goblins

2427.44 --> 2434.96
down before they

2431.119 --> 2437.599
get me i will die contentious okay

2434.96 --> 2440.48
if it'll come to that yeah absolutely

2437.599 --> 2440.48
same goes for me

2444.24 --> 2451.7599999999998
but let's just

2447.44 --> 2455.28
try to keep on building onto the future

2451.76 --> 2459.0400000000004
without that being inevitable

2455.28 --> 2460.88
just keep it in the back of your mind

2459.04 --> 2462.88
that it might happen at some point and

2460.88 --> 2465.76
that you need to be ready for that

2462.88 --> 2480.319
but don't count on it that's been my

2465.76 --> 2482.5600000000004
attitude with this

2480.319 --> 2486.16
steamy traveler no it's not the acid in

2482.56 --> 2489.2799999999997
tomatoes no as i just said

2486.16 --> 2490.72
one day i ate spaghetti sauce without

2489.28 --> 2494.8
the cheese sauce

2490.72 --> 2498.0789999999997
even with just regular cheese sprinkles

2494.8 --> 2501.119
no issues whatsoever from it nothing

2498.079 --> 2504.079
it wasn't the tomato

2501.119 --> 2504.96
sauce it was really the milk in the

2504.079 --> 2508.5600000000004
cheese sauce

2504.96 --> 2510.319
specifically fair is like palpable

2508.56 --> 2512.0789999999997
by the way which also means i'll never

2510.319 --> 2512.88
be able to really make hot chocolate

2512.079 --> 2514.8
again without

2512.88 --> 2517.76
getting similar issues and i even

2514.8 --> 2520.88
remember that yes

2517.76 --> 2524.4
so it's really

2520.88 --> 2524.4
heating milk that does it

2526.24 --> 2530.7999999999997
with me at least i don't know how that

2527.92 --> 2530.8
works with others

2532.41 --> 2537.839
[Music]

2534.839 --> 2537.839
uh

2548.839 --> 2552.7999999999997
okay

2550.0 --> 2554.88
well yeah guns would never rp sure arms

2552.8 --> 2556.7200000000003
dealers

2554.88 --> 2559.04
will do good business but at the same

2556.72 --> 2561.2
time they're also constantly being

2559.04 --> 2565.839
nagged

2561.2 --> 2565.839
by the federal government

2566.64 --> 2569.68
so unless you want to keep the black

2568.48 --> 2575.119
market or something

2569.68 --> 2575.1189999999997
which is also very illegal and dangerous

2575.2 --> 2581.04
it's not going to be that lucrative

2577.76 --> 2581.0400000000004
because you're constantly gonna be

2590.839 --> 2593.839
nagged

2603.599 --> 2607.839
hypothetically right right

2622.95 --> 2626.0299999999997
[Music]

2632.839 --> 2635.839
so

2646.839 --> 2649.839
okay

2654.96 --> 2658.4
well yeah at least clutchbear it's good

2657.119 --> 2663.839
that you're

2658.4 --> 2663.839
you're attempting or engaging in

2666.64 --> 2672.7999999999997
in a more homesteading farmer

2669.76 --> 2677.8390000000004
away from the city type setup

2672.8 --> 2677.8390000000004
will definitely give you a better chance

2712.16 --> 2720.0
did i see creepy joe song

2716.839 --> 2721.839
no which creepy but i have seen a lot of

2720.0 --> 2725.04
creepy joe

2721.839 --> 2727.839
clips and [ __ ] through infowars

2725.04 --> 2727.839
over the years

2730.88 --> 2733.839
a lot

2760.0 --> 2766.079
is responding to chat the norm

2763.119 --> 2767.52
yes yes it's pretty much the norm metals

2766.079 --> 2770.4
looks

2767.52 --> 2770.4
cockatiel

2771.119 --> 2777.28
dude it's it's been like it's been 929

2775.52 --> 2780.56
shows

2777.28 --> 2784.7200000000003
right and i do have topics

2780.56 --> 2788.0
but the way it works now is somebody

2784.72 --> 2790.3999999999996
needs me to talk about that topic

2788.0 --> 2792.16
genuine interest by asking a question

2790.4 --> 2794.8
and then i'll bring it up

2792.16 --> 2796.16
if i'm in the mood for it if i'm in the

2794.8 --> 2799.8390000000004
condition to do it

2796.16 --> 2802.96
some things are really tough so

2799.839 --> 2806.319
it's really up to the chat as to what

2802.96 --> 2810.2400000000002
the subject of the show is going to be

2806.319 --> 2813.7599999999998
and it usually ends up like having

2810.24 --> 2816.3999999999996
two or three subjects or

2813.76 --> 2817.76
just a bunch of kind of superficial

2816.4 --> 2821.359
chatter

2817.76 --> 2823.44
you know it all depends depends on

2821.359 --> 2825.44
whatever yeah what what's coming to the

2823.44 --> 2827.359
table and hey sometimes i might be

2825.44 --> 2829.119
really inspired

2827.359 --> 2831.2
about something that happened and then

2829.119 --> 2834.079
i'll have like a whole thing

2831.2 --> 2834.0789999999997
i'll roll out

2835.28 --> 2838.5600000000004
but yeah that doesn't happen really too

2837.28 --> 2840.3190000000004
often that

2838.56 --> 2843.2
the logical consequence of having a

2840.319 --> 2847.119
daily show like every single day

2843.2 --> 2847.1189999999997
on your own for years

2848.8 --> 2855.599
like if i would have had to like have

2852.079 --> 2858.319
a subject presented every single show

2855.599 --> 2860.7200000000003
i'd be like completely mentally crippled

2858.319 --> 2860.72
right now

2862.64 --> 2867.5989999999997
because doing that like every week maybe

2865.76 --> 2869.5200000000004
yeah that's doable that was during the

2867.599 --> 2872.4
flat earth talks

2869.52 --> 2874.48
days those years ago in the beginning

2872.4 --> 2877.52
that worked out fine

2874.48 --> 2880.319
but every day is just no way

2877.52 --> 2880.319
i can't do that

2882.16 --> 2887.92
but this works out just fine and i don't

2885.28 --> 2890.559
necessarily mind repeating

2887.92 --> 2890.559
subjects

2892.0 --> 2896.24
if somebody actually wants to hear about

2894.079 --> 2896.2400000000002
it

2897.92 --> 2901.44
but i'm not going to make a habit of

2899.359 --> 2902.7999999999997
just having this playbook constantly

2901.44 --> 2906.64
repeating

2902.8 --> 2911.44
certain subjects cyclically

2906.64 --> 2913.2799999999997
no that's that wouldn't work for me

2911.44 --> 2915.28
because it would make me feel like yeah

2913.28 --> 2917.8390000000004
i have no new subject so i'm going to

2915.28 --> 2917.8390000000004
recycle

2918.319 --> 2921.599
well if somebody in chat just asks me

2920.88 --> 2927.2000000000003
about it

2921.599 --> 2927.2000000000003
then it's like a two-way communication

2927.68 --> 2930.319
it's different

2937.92 --> 2945.28
right yeah but metal slugs cockatiel

2942.0 --> 2946.0
nathan oakley has a different type of

2945.28 --> 2957.8390000000004
show

2946.0 --> 2957.839
and he has a panel every time

2959.52 --> 2965.92
right so he set his show

2962.8 --> 2967.44
to those things and that that's what

2965.92 --> 2968.559
he's holding on to and that's what the

2967.44 --> 2970.0
panel's there for

2968.559 --> 2972.0
like that's what everybody's now

2970.0 --> 2975.68
expecting

2972.0 --> 2975.68
i never really did that

2976.48 --> 2981.04
like that i have other

2982.839 --> 2985.839
missions

2988.4 --> 2992.0
if you consider doing panel or interview

2990.559 --> 2996.0
well i have done that

2992.0 --> 2996.0
i have had a couple of panels

2997.119 --> 3002.48
early bird show had a couple of guests a

2999.68 --> 3002.48
couple of times

3005.28 --> 3011.44
interviews well

3008.559 --> 3012.7200000000003
sure i would do interviews if it's

3011.44 --> 3014.8
really

3012.72 --> 3018.7999999999997
somebody that wants to be interviewed by

3014.8 --> 3018.8
me haven't happened a lot

3020.0 --> 3023.359
also yeah there's some really weird

3021.599 --> 3024.8
people out there sometimes and if you

3023.359 --> 3026.4
just interview them

3024.8 --> 3028.2400000000002
like for the first time then you never

3026.4 --> 3030.559
really know how weird they turn out to

3028.24 --> 3033.839
be and there's been some weird people

3030.559 --> 3037.92
also on the show because of that so it

3033.839 --> 3037.92
interviewing is also just very different

3039.2 --> 3046.24
right because i do a live show

3042.48 --> 3049.2
proper interviewers always just record

3046.24 --> 3051.1189999999997
because then you know what you got and

3049.2 --> 3052.8799999999997
then you can decide afterward if you're

3051.119 --> 3054.96
all gonna do it live you never really

3052.88 --> 3068.7200000000003
know what's going to happen

3054.96 --> 3070.64
to you

3068.72 --> 3072.5589999999997
right clutch bear yeah exactly well

3070.64 --> 3074.0
that's really what i tried to do this is

3072.559 --> 3078.7200000000003
like the

3074.0 --> 3078.72
just yeah this is the r-win bar

3081.119 --> 3085.76
and we we talk all of us

3086.8 --> 3090.88
nathan show is bored really think so

3094.24 --> 3098.8799999999997
it gets sometimes a little but that's

3096.8 --> 3101.44
from my perspective

3098.88 --> 3105.28
right but you got to realize also that

3101.44 --> 3105.28
it's also meant for newer people

3109.68 --> 3114.0
what i do is really more meant for

3112.16 --> 3118.0
people that are kind of already

3114.0 --> 3120.8
into it and that's specifically what to

3118.0 --> 3120.8
reach out

3121.28 --> 3127.76
to more niche topics

3125.44 --> 3127.76
and

3128.8 --> 3132.559
but without getting themselves lost in

3131.44 --> 3139.839
them right

3132.559 --> 3139.8390000000004
that's what i typically do

3143.52 --> 3147.7599999999998
the fe bartender yeah sure steamy

3145.76 --> 3149.599
traveler

3147.76 --> 3150.8
i'm a pretty decent bartender i've done

3149.599 --> 3153.92
that

3150.8 --> 3153.92
not professionally yet

3161.52 --> 3165.119
i've done catering though that i've done

3164.079 --> 3168.7200000000003
professionally but

3165.119 --> 3181.839
yeah it's like working place cafeterias

3168.72 --> 3181.839
and [ __ ]

3187.119 --> 3193.76
right but in a way you know uh

3191.599 --> 3195.3590000000004
have you ever seen the series midnight

3193.76 --> 3199.76
dinner

3195.359 --> 3201.7599999999998
diner i mean it's a japanese series

3199.76 --> 3203.0400000000004
like i feel sometimes that's a little

3201.76 --> 3206.88
bit what i do

3203.04 --> 3209.92
it's just this very little tiny

3206.88 --> 3212.319
tiny little restaurant just one guy that

3209.92 --> 3212.319
makes it

3212.72 --> 3215.7599999999998
he doesn't have a luxurious assortment

3215.2 --> 3218.8799999999997
it's just

3215.76 --> 3221.28
kind of basic foods that everybody likes

3218.88 --> 3223.04
and yeah if you bring your own

3221.28 --> 3225.52
ingredients he'll make something with it

3223.04 --> 3228.64
like that it's really interesting right

3225.52 --> 3229.599
and it's just like this this little room

3228.64 --> 3232.64
with a

3229.599 --> 3234.7200000000003
bar and

3232.64 --> 3236.16
yeah and they all chat and that's like

3234.72 --> 3237.68
the series and they chat about

3236.16 --> 3239.04
everything and it feels

3237.68 --> 3240.72
it's of course totally different

3239.04 --> 3244.0
subjects more societal

3240.72 --> 3245.9199999999996
and all that but that's sometimes like

3244.0 --> 3249.52
how this feels a little

3245.92 --> 3251.6800000000003
except this is just digital

3249.52 --> 3252.88
and unfortunately i don't have actual

3251.68 --> 3255.1189999999997
food to present

3252.88 --> 3257.2000000000003
but i can talk about food and make you

3255.119 --> 3259.839
very very hungry as some of you have

3257.2 --> 3259.839
experienced

3261.68 --> 3265.839
all right see you later clutch bear

3268.24 --> 3275.839
stream of consciousness okay cool

3272.8 --> 3278.96
yes i do try to make people

3275.839 --> 3281.119
consciously engage

3278.96 --> 3283.52
it's i know that's always worked for me

3281.119 --> 3285.599
it's like even one-on-one

3283.52 --> 3287.359
if somebody's like giving these

3285.599 --> 3289.839
subconscious signs like i

3287.359 --> 3290.839
want to open up i want to reach further

3289.839 --> 3294.96
then it's like

3290.839 --> 3298.4
okay i literally almost

3294.96 --> 3300.88
literally almost i sort of

3298.4 --> 3302.96
like mentally open up another dimension

3300.88 --> 3305.04
between us and then i can literally draw

3302.96 --> 3307.76
in people in ways of thinking

3305.04 --> 3310.319
that will work for them that they've

3307.76 --> 3312.88
just never experienced before

3310.319 --> 3314.16
and i've had that ability since i was

3312.88 --> 3318.1600000000003
like

3314.16 --> 3320.0789999999997
a young teenager even but it would

3318.16 --> 3322.319
look if somebody would be like unwilling

3320.079 --> 3325.599
to do that however

3322.319 --> 3329.119
open up that that special bridge

3325.599 --> 3332.88
then i could barely get along with them

3329.119 --> 3337.04
then i'd feel like i'm a weirdo yeah

3332.88 --> 3337.04
so it's been quite weird for me

3337.52 --> 3342.72
but i don't know this ability doesn't

3341.52 --> 3344.96
seem to be

3342.72 --> 3347.359
limited to physical personal

3344.96 --> 3363.839
interactions

3347.359 --> 3363.839
i can do it through the internet as well

3370.48 --> 3374.839
right well yeah that describes it pretty

3372.48 --> 3377.839
well metals look

3374.839 --> 3377.839
cockatiel

3386.079 --> 3389.44
right but as a show host i don't just

3388.96 --> 3392.64
like

3389.44 --> 3394.319
fooling around being silly right i don't

3392.64 --> 3397.44
mind if people in chat do it

3394.319 --> 3400.799
a little they don't go squirting or

3397.44 --> 3403.599
getting really stupid but i

3400.799 --> 3405.839
myself i do take like everything very

3403.599 --> 3405.839
serious

3406.88 --> 3412.48
i always try to answer very seriously

3410.16 --> 3414.16
even if the person saying those things

3412.48 --> 3417.28
didn't really expect that

3414.16 --> 3419.839
then i still do it also do that with

3417.28 --> 3419.8390000000004
trolls

3433.119 --> 3438.559
it's also because might be a little bit

3436.16 --> 3440.24
of a character aberration that's going

3438.559 --> 3446.2400000000002
around in people that

3440.24 --> 3449.359
sometimes people are like afraid

3446.24 --> 3451.9199999999996
take their

3449.359 --> 3453.92
curiosity seriously so they ask a

3451.92 --> 3455.44
question but they presented like i don't

3453.92 --> 3459.359
really care

3455.44 --> 3459.359
but secretly they do really care

3459.44 --> 3464.64
right but they'd be kind of like

3462.64 --> 3467.04
afraid of the answer a little so they'd

3464.64 --> 3469.1189999999997
cover it up like they didn't really care

3467.04 --> 3471.2799999999997
to give like cover for themselves not to

3469.119 --> 3474.559
be shocked or disappointed

3471.28 --> 3477.119
seen that a lot and that's part of the

3474.559 --> 3480.079
reason why i sometimes just completely

3477.119 --> 3481.04
ignore such elements don't take it

3480.079 --> 3484.319
personally and just

3481.04 --> 3489.44
literally answer it and that seems to be

3484.319 --> 3491.92
working out just great with trolls

3489.44 --> 3493.92
because of course they are completely

3491.92 --> 3495.52
drowned in insecurity about themselves

3493.92 --> 3498.2400000000002
that's why they have that attitude

3495.52 --> 3501.2
that's why they do keep anonymous

3498.24 --> 3502.4799999999996
right but they might have actual real

3501.2 --> 3505.52
questions that they just

3502.48 --> 3506.72
can't normally formulate so they do it

3505.52 --> 3511.2
like that and that's why

3506.72 --> 3513.7599999999998
then just literally answer

3511.2 --> 3517.839
and they'd never expect it yet it

3513.76 --> 3517.8390000000004
happens every time

3521.44 --> 3528.839
oh it's already past three huh

3525.359 --> 3530.319
i'll time this fly a little i'll keep

3528.839 --> 3544.24
going

3530.319 --> 3546.48
chat pretty good

3544.24 --> 3547.52
oh wait still in 80 12. you were going

3546.48 --> 3550.96
not clutch bear

3547.52 --> 3550.96
alright see you later stallion

3552.06 --> 3556.64
[Applause]

3554.72 --> 3559.04
sometimes i just misread the chat a

3556.64 --> 3561.7599999999998
little and then i discover like a few

3559.04 --> 3561.7599999999998
minutes later

3562.24 --> 3566.0
i hope it's not too distracting

3566.319 --> 3573.839
for watchers right

3574.4 --> 3578.96
what's the most people i ever had in

3576.72 --> 3578.9599999999996
chat

3579.599 --> 3582.2400000000002
i don't know

3582.64 --> 3588.4
it's not like i literally keep track

3586.4 --> 3590.079
but i've had times that the chat would

3588.4 --> 3593.2000000000003
be pretty spinning

3590.079 --> 3595.28
as in there would be like somebody

3593.2 --> 3598.48
commenting every

3595.28 --> 3598.48
10 seconds at least

3599.359 --> 3603.7599999999998
so maybe the most that i remember it

3602.559 --> 3606.6400000000003
also depends you know

3603.76 --> 3606.6400000000003
this one time

3607.599 --> 3611.92
still one of my highest viewed shows was

3610.16 --> 3615.2799999999997
it with the flat earth talks when i had

3611.92 --> 3617.92
nathan oakley on

3615.28 --> 3618.559
and the title was called the flat earth

3617.92 --> 3623.599
the mother of

3618.559 --> 3626.0
all bombs or foreign

3623.599 --> 3628.319
but that show got like a whole bunch of

3626.0 --> 3632.24
people acted in chat

3628.319 --> 3632.24
because he drew a big crowd with him

3634.72 --> 3639.1189999999997
but yeah during that show i wasn't doing

3637.119 --> 3640.88
this

3639.119 --> 3643.44
i was literally talking with nathan the

3640.88 --> 3647.44
whole time life though

3643.44 --> 3650.88
uh as for the early bird show

3647.44 --> 3654.2400000000002
i'm not sure how many people i've had

3650.88 --> 3654.2400000000002
at once acted in chat

3654.319 --> 3658.16
maybe like 20

3656.26 --> 3660.96
[Music]

3658.16 --> 3664.319
this is just guess work at this point i

3660.96 --> 3664.319
don't know how to check that

3668.0 --> 3672.799
except for literally watching every

3670.319 --> 3675.92
freaking show and then counting how many

3672.799 --> 3678.799
people were active in chat that seems a

3675.92 --> 3678.799
little tiresome

3682.839 --> 3685.839
okay

3694.0 --> 3699.839
right yes

3706.24 --> 3710.24
yeah metal slug cocktails yes indeed

3708.799 --> 3714.799
yeah healthy eating i

3710.24 --> 3718.0
i eat purely organic i've done so for

3714.799 --> 3722.72
whoa 15 years

3718.0 --> 3722.72
damn that's a long time and

3723.039 --> 3727.5200000000004
i tried to make most myself but yeah

3725.44 --> 3730.88
organically there are some

3727.52 --> 3734.48
decently pre-fab foods but still

3730.88 --> 3734.48
i don't try to rely on that

3734.96 --> 3738.839
because it's just much better when i

3736.4 --> 3741.839
make something myself with all fresh

3738.839 --> 3741.839
ingredients

3745.039 --> 3754.48
i filter my water also takes

3748.96 --> 3757.039
take very supplements

3754.48 --> 3758.64
i take more supplements that i did like

3757.039 --> 3762.0
15 years ago

3758.64 --> 3763.44
i kind of started out with iodine

3762.0 --> 3766.319
supplements

3763.44 --> 3768.96
back then it was thanks to alex jones's

3766.319 --> 3772.24
info but it didn't know at all

3768.96 --> 3775.28
but i started out with just kelp tablets

3772.24 --> 3777.52
and then later got his product through

3775.28 --> 3779.3590000000004
ordering it on the internet and that was

3777.52 --> 3781.68
much later though

3779.359 --> 3782.4
also really got into green tea i stepped

3781.68 --> 3786.72
away from

3782.4 --> 3786.7200000000003
all kinds of uh

3787.2 --> 3794.0789999999997
sodas don't drink sodas anymore ever

3791.92 --> 3795.839
like the only fizzy drink that i ever

3794.079 --> 3799.44
drink

3795.839 --> 3800.96
is beer organic by the way exclusively

3799.44 --> 3804.319
organic

3800.96 --> 3806.079
and like no more sodas ever and there

3804.319 --> 3808.16
are organic sodas and they're

3806.079 --> 3810.079
yeah they're actually kind of nice tasty

3808.16 --> 3811.2
whatever i used to drink them like 10

3810.079 --> 3815.8390000000004
years ago i don't

3811.2 --> 3819.1189999999997
do that anymore ever so my primary drink

3815.839 --> 3822.16
has been green tea

3819.119 --> 3825.119
for a very long time

3822.16 --> 3825.92
and yeah for the last is it two years

3825.119 --> 3828.7200000000003
now

3825.92 --> 3828.7200000000003
i drink beer

3831.52 --> 3841.2
a couple

3838.16 --> 3843.359
also got my own fresh herbs like

3841.2 --> 3844.319
in the kitchen window take good care of

3843.359 --> 3848.64
them or

3844.319 --> 3853.839
they're blooming like even my oregano

3848.64 --> 3853.839
plant is now blooming it's really cute

3858.88 --> 3869.359
organic partially

3866.079 --> 3871.119
right yeah home-cooked first process is

3869.359 --> 3874.48
a big difference

3871.119 --> 3876.96
but that's everywhere but especially in

3874.48 --> 3876.96
america

3879.44 --> 3886.7200000000003
but i would never ever i will

3882.88 --> 3887.6800000000003
never ever eat again non-organic

3886.72 --> 3895.839
processed

3887.68 --> 3895.839
ever never never do that

3897.68 --> 3901.5989999999997
yeah steamy trevor i do eat organic free

3900.64 --> 3909.839
range eggs

3901.599 --> 3909.839
that's right

3934.839 --> 3937.839
uh

3945.52 --> 3952.24
have i tried going vegan no i have been

3948.96 --> 3954.4
vegetarian for a year though

3952.24 --> 3957.68
that was two years ago i was a

3954.4 --> 3957.6800000000003
vegetarian for a year

3959.359 --> 3965.52
but i'm never gonna go vegan screw that

3962.799 --> 3969.28
absolutely screw it i mean there is some

3965.52 --> 3969.28
really nice vegan food though

3971.28 --> 3974.799
but yeah if it's nice and it's good and

3973.599 --> 3978.079
it doesn't have so

3974.799 --> 3981.2
so yeah insulated

3978.079 --> 3984.2400000000002
i might eat it but i'm not

3981.2 --> 3987.5989999999997
going to like eat vegan only

3984.24 --> 3990.4799999999996
no way unless

3987.599 --> 3993.839
like organic vegan food is like the only

3990.48 --> 3993.839
decent food available

3994.079 --> 3997.3590000000004
right if i'm going to have to choose

3996.799 --> 4000.72
between

3997.359 --> 4004.72
vegan and non-organic

4000.72 --> 4007.839
like meat yeah i know

4004.72 --> 4007.839
i'm gonna choose the vegan

4011.599 --> 4015.52
unless there's freaking soy in it so

4013.68 --> 4021.839
that's why i always ask

4015.52 --> 4021.839
because soy is just not good

4025.119 --> 4029.76
what are the main differences between

4026.72 --> 4032.9599999999996
vegan and vegetarian well a vegan

4029.76 --> 4036.7200000000003
doesn't take any animal

4032.96 --> 4037.68
product so that means no milk and no

4036.72 --> 4041.68
eggs

4037.68 --> 4049.839
either it's just all plants

4041.68 --> 4049.839
that's the difference

4071.2 --> 4077.839
all done

4088.839 --> 4091.839
okay

4107.12 --> 4114.5599999999995
right yeah well

4110.88 --> 4118.88
i usually don't eat meat twice

4114.56 --> 4121.679
in a row

4118.88 --> 4123.52
sometimes i do but usually when i've

4121.679 --> 4126.88
eaten something with meat in it i

4123.52 --> 4130.080000000001
tend to like the next day don't

4126.88 --> 4134.319
do that and just eat

4130.08 --> 4137.5199999999995
like basic french fries in my eggs

4134.319 --> 4140.2390000000005
as a lunch french fries later and i just

4137.52 --> 4140.2390000000005
keep it to that

4143.92 --> 4149.6
so i eat less sort of like halfway

4147.52 --> 4152.080000000001
fasting it's not of course actually

4149.6 --> 4154.56
effectively fasting but

4152.08 --> 4157.5199999999995
it seems to work out for me and it does

4154.56 --> 4157.52
save some cost

4157.679 --> 4160.96
it does save me some money to do it like

4159.6 --> 4163.359
that like not

4160.96 --> 4165.44
insist that i have like a full dinner

4163.359 --> 4167.120000000001
like every single day

4165.44 --> 4175.839
and it doesn't really seem to need it

4167.12 --> 4175.839
that much

4180.4 --> 4184.3189999999995
but yeah i look in that year that i was

4183.04 --> 4186.4
vegetarian

4184.319 --> 4187.679
i didn't miss me at all there was

4186.4 --> 4191.3589999999995
something in my

4187.679 --> 4193.759
system that was just like no no me

4191.359 --> 4195.1990000000005
and i didn't want it even the smell of

4193.759 --> 4198.08
it was just like

4195.199 --> 4200.4
didn't like it but then after a year it

4198.08 --> 4203.04
kind of slowly like yeah you need me

4200.4 --> 4204.96
and then suddenly it's just like aha out

4203.04 --> 4207.199
of nowhere the craving came back big

4204.96 --> 4207.199
time

4208.239 --> 4214.0
but i did feel like it was good for me

4210.4 --> 4216.2
to have been vegetarian for a year

4214.0 --> 4219.319
that did me some good

4216.2 --> 4219.3189999999995
[Music]

4223.44 --> 4228.48
also because of that i discovered that a

4226.08 --> 4232.08
lot of meals that i would typically make

4228.48 --> 4232.639999999999
for decades and i did it always with

4232.08 --> 4236.4
meat i

4232.64 --> 4240.320000000001
figured out ways to do them

4236.4 --> 4242.799999999999
vegetarian practically vegan in a way

4240.32 --> 4244.0
that it was still really nice i actually

4242.8 --> 4248.08
a lot of meals i

4244.0 --> 4250.48
changed to becoming vegan

4248.08 --> 4252.4
because i like them better like my

4250.48 --> 4253.919999999999
spaghetti sauce i don't make them with

4252.4 --> 4255.28
meat anymore i used to make them with

4253.92 --> 4257.12
beef in it

4255.28 --> 4258.88
i don't do that anymore i replaced it

4257.12 --> 4262.719
with carrots

4258.88 --> 4273.36
and eggplant it works great

4262.719 --> 4275.04
i like it better it feels better

4273.36 --> 4276.88
when i was a vegetarian how did you

4275.04 --> 4279.199
mainly get protein well the eggs of

4276.88 --> 4279.1990000000005
course

4281.44 --> 4285.04
and still through vegetables

4285.12 --> 4301.84
but the eggs were really important

4287.44 --> 4301.839999999999
during that time

4318.75 --> 4321.84
[Music]

4326.84 --> 4329.84
foreign

4340.84 --> 4343.84
right

4368.84 --> 4371.84
this

4372.159 --> 4376.32
right by the way steam traveler like as

4373.92 --> 4378.32
a vegetarian

4376.32 --> 4385.44
there's also a lot of protein in a lot

4378.32 --> 4389.12
of different types of nuts

4385.44 --> 4389.12
so i did eat more of those

4389.76 --> 4399.84
i ate a lot of peanuts too

4402.239 --> 4413.839999999999
hey dale is that really you

4417.36 --> 4426.0
nuts and beans well beans yeah

4420.48 --> 4429.28
but beans don't fit like in every meal

4426.0 --> 4432.4
no at night they do nuts so dude i

4429.28 --> 4433.759999999999
i didn't i wasn't like oh i'm not eating

4432.4 --> 4437.44
meat anymore so i have to

4433.76 --> 4437.4400000000005
over compensate no

4437.84 --> 4441.679
no i didn't do that i wasn't that i'm

4439.84 --> 4443.76
not desperate for those things you know

4441.679 --> 4445.84
when i my body really starts to need

4443.76 --> 4455.84
something

4445.84 --> 4455.84
i trust the impulses

4455.87 --> 4459.0289999999995
[Music]

4460.96 --> 4464.8
and again i didn't really feel like i

4463.04 --> 4468.239
even needed the meat back then

4464.8 --> 4468.88
in that year of vegetarianism it was

4468.239 --> 4472.5599999999995
just

4468.88 --> 4475.92
like no i didn't really need it

4472.56 --> 4479.6
if i had needed it then i would probably

4475.92 --> 4479.6
be craving for it constantly

4480.64 --> 4497.84
but i did

4509.76 --> 4513.6
that's right beyond the imaginary curve

4511.679 --> 4517.12
though absolutely

4513.6 --> 4517.84
well that's what my mother and my father

4517.12 --> 4520.239
too

4517.84 --> 4523.12
like way when i was way young already

4520.239 --> 4523.12
tried to teach me

4523.6 --> 4527.679
and i did learn that like i did take

4527.199 --> 4530.719
that

4527.679 --> 4531.679
lesson to heart but then again there was

4530.719 --> 4533.84
also like ooh

4531.679 --> 4534.96
candy addiction so that kind of got in

4533.84 --> 4539.1990000000005
the way of that

4534.96 --> 4542.56
but i've taken care of it

4539.199 --> 4542.5599999999995
that was 15 years ago

4543.36 --> 4548.96
like before 15 years ago i was eating

4545.679 --> 4548.96
like really shitty food

4550.96 --> 4557.52
like chips with flavor enhancers and all

4553.679 --> 4557.52
kinds of crabs and sodas and

4564.96 --> 4568.4800000000005
and when you eat that then your body's

4567.52 --> 4571.6
impulses do

4568.48 --> 4573.678999999999
get rerouted into a more addiction based

4571.6 --> 4577.04
model that's the problem with that

4573.679 --> 4579.52
but since i stopped doing that got rid

4577.04 --> 4582.159
of it all i it cleaned me up so much

4579.52 --> 4582.64
not eating all that crap and msg and

4582.159 --> 4586.0
such

4582.64 --> 4588.400000000001
anymore that it wasn't that hard for me

4586.0 --> 4590.159
to get rid of the old addiction cycle it

4588.4 --> 4593.36
would just be like no you just

4590.159 --> 4595.759999999999
never eat it anymore

4593.36 --> 4598.239
it took some time because sometimes

4595.76 --> 4601.6
would sneakily sneak in just like one

4598.239 --> 4601.599999999999
chip just to remember

4602.719 --> 4606.4800000000005
and eventually those started to taste

4604.8 --> 4610.320000000001
really bad to me

4606.48 --> 4610.32
and then i just didn't try that anymore

4621.6 --> 4625.52
all right but it's been quite a hassle

4623.36 --> 4628.639999999999
though when i still had sort of a

4625.52 --> 4630.96
halfway decent social life

4628.64 --> 4632.96
when i still hung around with a lot of

4630.96 --> 4635.52
people regularly

4632.96 --> 4636.2390000000005
because they they didn't do that they

4635.52 --> 4639.280000000001
wouldn't

4636.239 --> 4639.959999999999
he'd be strictly organic nobody i didn't

4639.28 --> 4644.239
know

4639.96 --> 4646.0
anybody anybody

4644.239 --> 4647.759999999999
that would be eating strictly organic

4646.0 --> 4651.84
when i started to try it out

4647.76 --> 4651.84
not a soul

4652.96 --> 4657.92
so that was very difficult because

4656.239 --> 4659.919999999999
basically build the habit okay you're

4657.92 --> 4662.719
gonna go somewhere a party or

4659.92 --> 4664.0
go visit somebody yeah i bring my own

4662.719 --> 4667.12
drink i bring my own

4664.0 --> 4669.28
food every time it's like no i'm not

4667.12 --> 4670.239
going somewhere and unless i can bring

4669.28 --> 4672.88
my own food

4670.239 --> 4674.4
because if i'm gonna think oh i'll just

4672.88 --> 4677.6
get some food there

4674.4 --> 4679.599999999999
well guess what no organic food

4677.6 --> 4680.88
and then people would even be like

4679.6 --> 4682.8
agitated like what

4680.88 --> 4685.04
what is this kind of special need like

4682.8 --> 4687.1990000000005
oh we have vegetarian

4685.04 --> 4689.12
we have vegetarian no it's not freaking

4687.199 --> 4691.919999999999
vegetarian it's organic

4689.12 --> 4694.159
not vegetarian you know how long that

4691.92 --> 4694.159
took

4694.56 --> 4697.6
for people to even kind of know the

4696.56 --> 4699.360000000001
difference

4697.6 --> 4700.96
there's people out there that still

4699.36 --> 4701.32
don't know the difference they think

4700.96 --> 4704.32
that

4701.32 --> 4705.36
vegetarian is organic because they're

4704.32 --> 4709.12
stupid

4705.36 --> 4709.12
and they're not informed about it

4710.159 --> 4714.639999999999
i think it's probably less by now but

4712.32 --> 4717.199
still like that was a really big issue

4714.64 --> 4719.52
is that people just didn't get it

4717.199 --> 4721.5199999999995
when i tried doing that i was like a

4719.52 --> 4723.280000000001
crazy conspiracy theorist oh you're

4721.52 --> 4726.96
paranoid about food

4723.28 --> 4730.96
what do you think 9 11 is an inside job

4726.96 --> 4730.96
that [ __ ] constantly

4732.84 --> 4735.84
constantly

4736.56 --> 4749.84
so yeah i was keeping to myself a lot

4769.6 --> 4773.4400000000005
uh and i wanted to eat earth yeah yeah

4771.92 --> 4775.92
the dirt

4773.44 --> 4777.28
that's a very specific mineral craving

4775.92 --> 4780.0
where that comes from is really

4777.28 --> 4780.0
fascinating

4785.679 --> 4792.4
clay does some amazing things

4789.52 --> 4794.2390000000005
and i have dirt i literally have that

4792.4 --> 4794.5599999999995
and i've taken that even on the show i

4794.239 --> 4799.36
have

4794.56 --> 4799.360000000001
dirt eating dirt is really good for you

4802.4 --> 4809.759999999999
right this stuff it's dirt

4805.84 --> 4813.360000000001
it's just dirt just a bunch of clay

4809.76 --> 4816.8
well it's really refined clay no

4813.36 --> 4818.639
but it is basically just plain uh yeah i

4816.8 --> 4833.84
can't really get it out

4818.639 --> 4833.84
anyway i don't have a spoon

4835.12 --> 4847.84
archway was an inside job yeah it was

4837.44 --> 4847.839999999999
adam meekin did it

4855.04 --> 4861.84
balance okay

4862.88 --> 4870.08
what uh will billions you're

4867.44 --> 4870.08
a woman

4872.719 --> 4876.4800000000005
i didn't know you got pregnant

4880.56 --> 4883.92
welcome to the chat by the way

4885.679 --> 4889.4400000000005
and yeah man thanks for that amazing

4887.84 --> 4893.28
donation

4889.44 --> 4897.04
in may it really made my month

4893.28 --> 4897.04
it's good stuff thanks again

4900.08 --> 4905.36
totally female okay well now i know

4903.52 --> 4908.080000000001
i didn't know will could be like a

4905.36 --> 4908.08
female name

4909.76 --> 4912.0
huh

4913.76 --> 4918.56
i guess it is technically possible

4916.88 --> 4921.6
because in dutch

4918.56 --> 4923.4400000000005
a name like villi is

4921.6 --> 4927.04
potentially female it's one of those

4923.44 --> 4927.04
names that can be male and female

4927.36 --> 4931.839999999999
i just never thought about it

4933.28 --> 4938.0
it's not a name that's really that

4934.96 --> 4945.84
common anymore here it's more like a

4938.0 --> 4945.84
early 20th century dutch name

4956.84 --> 4959.84
right

4960.159 --> 4967.599999999999
i get many trolls here well

4963.84 --> 4968.08
no it's not that bad but there are a

4967.6 --> 4970.400000000001
couple

4968.08 --> 4971.44
that are really like gay for me or

4970.4 --> 4973.679
something

4971.44 --> 4975.5199999999995
so i do have this guy that comes well

4973.679 --> 4977.52
sometimes he's just in one of those

4975.52 --> 4978.159000000001
moods and then he sends me text messages

4977.52 --> 4981.040000000001
and sends

4978.159 --> 4982.48
trolls over to the chat but it's not

4981.04 --> 4984.719
every day

4982.48 --> 4987.839999999999
it's only when he's in a bad mood i

4984.719 --> 4987.84
think it's just one guy

4988.4 --> 4991.92
but it could be a couple just a couple

4990.48 --> 5001.839999999999
of people that seem to be

4991.92 --> 5001.84
obsessing over me

5007.76 --> 5012.320000000001
you eat organic only partially so then

5010.8 --> 5015.76
you don't eat organic only

5012.32 --> 5015.759999999999
you eat organic partially

5023.36 --> 5031.5199999999995
right yeah we will billions we got those

5027.52 --> 5031.52
types of ordering systems here too

5032.0 --> 5038.48
i personally don't do it but yeah

5035.199 --> 5038.96
that is pretty efficient there's quite a

5038.48 --> 5041.36
few

5038.96 --> 5043.28
ladies but the ladies really seem to

5041.36 --> 5045.839999999999
like that system

5043.28 --> 5045.84
good with it

5046.4 --> 5057.28
but yeah there's many companies that do

5048.4 --> 5060.239
that here too

5057.28 --> 5063.199
i think that even like the organic

5060.239 --> 5065.759999999999
grocery store the supermarket

5063.199 --> 5067.919999999999
eco plaza oh by the way i saw like

5065.76 --> 5070.8
advertisement that was funny like

5067.92 --> 5071.679
when i was watching football and [ __ ] in

5070.8 --> 5073.76
the commercials

5071.679 --> 5074.88
in between really bad ones there was

5073.76 --> 5078.0
also

5074.88 --> 5080.0
eco plaza advertisement which is

5078.0 --> 5082.4
my organic sir that was really funny and

5080.0 --> 5087.28
i like their advertising you know

5082.4 --> 5087.28
their advertising is good it's not

5088.0 --> 5092.32
it's not like super social justice

5090.08 --> 5096.84
warrior [ __ ]

5092.32 --> 5100.159
i like their style much more than most

5096.84 --> 5101.28
uh but they do it too that you can do it

5100.159 --> 5105.199
at their store too

5101.28 --> 5113.199
and order vegetable boxes

5105.199 --> 5116.5599999999995
over there

5113.199 --> 5119.44
look if i like had a family

5116.56 --> 5122.0
girlfriend maybe kids i would definitely

5119.44 --> 5123.839999999999
go for that setup too then yeah a box of

5122.0 --> 5125.28
vegetables would definitely be a good

5123.84 --> 5128.2390000000005
thing

5125.28 --> 5128.239
and save some money

5128.37 --> 5133.28
[Music]

5130.0 --> 5141.84
but on my own it just

5133.28 --> 5141.84
doesn't really match my my food habits

5152.84 --> 5158.4800000000005
nice

5154.239 --> 5158.48
yeah sounds delicious metal slugs

5164.36 --> 5169.839999999999
[Music]

5166.84 --> 5169.84
cockatiel

5180.48 --> 5185.839999999999
expecting any major events before the

5183.199 --> 5185.839999999999
end of the year

5186.639 --> 5188.96
uh

5193.12 --> 5197.599999999999
what's a major event you mean like a

5195.92 --> 5201.12
radical turnaround that

5197.6 --> 5204.2390000000005
changes everything no

5201.12 --> 5207.5199999999995
no i don't i think they're just going to

5204.239 --> 5209.599999999999
do the same [ __ ] over again

5207.52 --> 5211.360000000001
you know when the summer's over they're

5209.6 --> 5213.280000000001
going to be pushing oh no

5211.36 --> 5214.799999999999
there's no new for ryan it's like

5213.28 --> 5216.32
there's going to be a new freaking

5214.8 --> 5219.6
supposed corona of rain

5216.32 --> 5222.84
every year every

5219.6 --> 5226.159000000001
year forever for

5222.84 --> 5228.719
ever they will never

5226.159 --> 5229.92
stop it it's going to be something that

5228.719 --> 5232.639
if we let them

5229.92 --> 5233.4400000000005
they're going to keep pushing this every

5232.639 --> 5237.28
year

5233.44 --> 5241.44
forever never going to stop

5237.28 --> 5242.96
until we all just say okay

5241.44 --> 5245.36
we don't care about your [ __ ]

5242.96 --> 5245.36
anymore

5248.56 --> 5253.84
you're not gonna do this

5255.76 --> 5259.360000000001
why didn't they even announce this [ __ ]

5258.08 --> 5262.0
like freaking

5259.36 --> 5262.0
yesterday

5263.84 --> 5270.159000000001
the missionary minister of health diola

5266.96 --> 5272.639
what disgusting guy that is he looks

5270.159 --> 5273.92
would you say it like you know there's

5272.639 --> 5276.400000000001
something coming

5273.92 --> 5278.4
oh at the end of the summer we're

5276.4 --> 5281.04
probably going to have to go

5278.4 --> 5282.48
step back again because the new corona

5281.04 --> 5284.8
variety

5282.48 --> 5287.678999999999
yeah they just say exactly what they're

5284.8 --> 5287.679
gonna do man

5289.92 --> 5294.0
they got the wider public by the

5292.84 --> 5297.6
presuppositional

5294.0 --> 5297.6
by the presuppositional balls

5298.8 --> 5303.1990000000005
because they can just they've declared

5301.76 --> 5305.6
these conditions

5303.199 --> 5308.239
in your body conditions to be infectious

5305.6 --> 5308.56
diseases and now they got you because

5308.239 --> 5311.04
you

5308.56 --> 5313.76
all fall for it because you all believe

5311.04 --> 5316.8
that it's actually possible like that

5313.76 --> 5322.08
so they can just keep this stupid thing

5316.8 --> 5324.639
story going basically making you

5322.08 --> 5326.639
pay for your own logical inner body

5324.639 --> 5329.52
chemistry

5326.639 --> 5331.36
and do this and they will not stop they

5329.52 --> 5334.080000000001
will not stop until people say

5331.36 --> 5334.5599999999995
hey dude you don't have any freaking

5334.08 --> 5337.199
proof

5334.56 --> 5338.320000000001
that any of this physically exists that

5337.199 --> 5341.28
the model

5338.32 --> 5342.799999999999
the models you use make any damn sense

5341.28 --> 5343.679
whatsoever it's just a bunch of

5342.8 --> 5348.88
statistical

5343.679 --> 5348.88
guessing like freaking economists

5349.12 --> 5354.0
are better at predicting what's going on

5352.32 --> 5357.5199999999995
than you because your model is

5354.0 --> 5357.52
completely faulty

5358.4 --> 5362.719
it's just all condition based and then

5360.56 --> 5365.1990000000005
you make up a [ __ ] story about how

5362.719 --> 5368.32
it's all infectious it's complete

5365.199 --> 5369.28
horseshit you know what's infectious by

5368.32 --> 5374.639
your standard

5369.28 --> 5374.639
it's not actually the freaking vaccine

5374.719 --> 5379.84
people get it from it get that condition

5377.92 --> 5380.96
not the virus because you can't get a

5379.84 --> 5384.159000000001
virus

5380.96 --> 5387.84
virus is in your body it comes

5384.159 --> 5390.0
to do stuff to clean you up

5387.84 --> 5392.159000000001
that's what a virus is it's not an

5390.0 --> 5395.52
infectious agent

5392.159 --> 5398.5599999999995
right but yeah people get the condition

5395.52 --> 5401.6
especially from these freaking vaccines

5398.56 --> 5401.6
that are in vaccines

5402.4 --> 5407.839999999999
because it's poison

5418.84 --> 5421.84
uh

5430.639 --> 5437.04
space threat

5434.8 --> 5437.04
what

5440.08 --> 5442.239
no

5445.76 --> 5452.719
how would that work

5449.76 --> 5454.4800000000005
unless there's like freaking ufos

5452.719 --> 5457.6
floating over city or

5454.48 --> 5461.36
floating over streets and literally just

5457.6 --> 5464.639
like shooting at people why the hell

5461.36 --> 5467.599999999999
would a space threat cause people to

5464.639 --> 5470.719
lock themselves inside their houses that

5467.6 --> 5470.719
doesn't make any sense

5473.76 --> 5477.6
i'm able to just say it like oh no more

5476.08 --> 5480.88
there's no more virus threat

5477.6 --> 5482.88
now it's aliens we have to do social

5480.88 --> 5483.52
distancing and lockdown because of

5482.88 --> 5486.159000000001
aliens

5483.52 --> 5489.040000000001
right it'll make even less sense it will

5486.159 --> 5491.239
just be completely psychotic

5489.04 --> 5492.88
maybe they'll do that maybe they'll just

5491.239 --> 5495.919999999999
completely crash

5492.88 --> 5499.76
every aspect of logic

5495.92 --> 5502.8
in how they will unroll it total

5499.76 --> 5504.88
blabbering idiots maybe i think that

5502.8 --> 5509.12
would be kind of crazy though

5504.88 --> 5510.4800000000005
i think i don't think they're crazy

5509.12 --> 5514.08
enough to do that

5510.48 --> 5514.08
to make it that psychotic

5516.0 --> 5533.84
but baby i'm underestimating it

5544.84 --> 5551.52
hmm you think so

5547.679 --> 5554.719
they'll space force to get together

5551.52 --> 5556.96
to to to fulfill reagan's saying you

5554.719 --> 5556.96
mean

5557.28 --> 5563.199
that famous reagan speech there was a

5559.679 --> 5566.639
day it's basically an outside threat

5563.199 --> 5569.599999999999
and maybe people

5566.639 --> 5570.88
finally work together i don't know

5569.6 --> 5574.08
paraphrasing

5570.88 --> 5576.2390000000005
but yeah maybe maybe that's like

5574.08 --> 5577.44
sort of a card that could still be

5576.239 --> 5580.0
played at some point

5577.44 --> 5580.0
you don't know

5582.719 --> 5587.199
it's certain it certainly makes more

5584.88 --> 5589.679
grounds for a lot more of those types of

5587.199 --> 5591.919999999999
sci-fi stories

5589.679 --> 5591.92
right

5595.84 --> 5601.04
space force is basically just a

5597.76 --> 5604.320000000001
storytelling project

5601.04 --> 5609.679
if it even is that if it's not

5604.32 --> 5609.679
just a front for propaganda

5609.92 --> 5615.04
secret service [ __ ] that it's actually

5613.52 --> 5617.120000000001
more about censorship

5615.04 --> 5620.08
and like oh we have to perfect the

5617.12 --> 5622.4
agency to ensure that the flat earth

5620.08 --> 5623.679
stops spreading or something it could be

5622.4 --> 5631.839999999999
that you don't

5623.679 --> 5631.84
know you don't know could be that

5632.639 --> 5636.719
i kind of thought that that it that was

5635.199 --> 5638.719
what it was

5636.719 --> 5640.32
that space force like no there's nothing

5638.719 --> 5641.679
really happening and there's not even

5640.32 --> 5644.799999999999
stories gonna be made

5641.679 --> 5647.92
out of this it's just

5644.8 --> 5650.88
people being hired

5647.92 --> 5659.84
to stop the flat earthers it could just

5650.88 --> 5659.84
be that

5661.28 --> 5673.84
oh hey nick bye nick

5695.199 --> 5699.5199999999995
right yes beyond the imaginary curve yes

5698.08 --> 5704.159
they don't like

5699.52 --> 5704.159000000001
the story being questioned and also

5706.0 --> 5709.52
a lot of flat earthers and the freedom

5708.4 --> 5712.839999999999
it is provided

5709.52 --> 5715.84
seems to be just more of a challenge

5712.84 --> 5715.84
than

5716.639 --> 5719.92
then they originally predict or maybe

5718.48 --> 5723.839999999999
they just

5719.92 --> 5723.84
it's just a bigger challenge to them

5725.44 --> 5729.759999999999
so who knows what all that funding is

5727.36 --> 5732.4
going into it could simply

5729.76 --> 5732.88
be that the funding is purely dedicated

5732.4 --> 5736.719
for

5732.88 --> 5737.52
really really dips deep psychological

5736.719 --> 5743.6
research

5737.52 --> 5746.080000000001
in how to perfect semantics

5743.6 --> 5747.52
literally to perfect the use of words so

5746.08 --> 5749.6
they can literally just

5747.52 --> 5751.52
rearrange what type of words are going

5749.6 --> 5752.96
to be popularized they probably already

5751.52 --> 5756.639
been doing this but to perfect

5752.96 --> 5757.04
this to literally just use words that'll

5756.639 --> 5760.88
make

5757.04 --> 5763.6
people even more ingrained in their

5760.88 --> 5767.04
conditioning against flat earthers

5763.6 --> 5767.52
might be that who knows what all that

5767.04 --> 5770.4
money

5767.52 --> 5785.360000000001
went out for they had a big freaking

5770.4 --> 5789.119
budget for space force other countries

5785.36 --> 5789.119
their own space forces no

5792.08 --> 5796.719
steam trail i don't think other

5793.44 --> 5799.36
countries have the need to do that

5796.719 --> 5801.28
like the us has to defend the moon

5799.36 --> 5804.32
landing

5801.28 --> 5806.4
from a state from the state perspective

5804.32 --> 5810.0
other countries doesn't really matter to

5806.4 --> 5810.0
them it's not as important

5811.36 --> 5815.119
i think most countries really are just

5813.44 --> 5818.32
fine enough for it all

5815.119 --> 5821.839999999999
to just end and move on it's really

5818.32 --> 5825.04
america that is just keeping that story

5821.84 --> 5827.84
like they insist that it must be

5825.04 --> 5827.84
kept real

5828.96 --> 5832.96
despite all the problems that come with

5838.84 --> 5841.84
it

5844.239 --> 5851.839999999999
right yes no words like mosquito virus

5848.4 --> 5854.638999999999
yeah there's no mosquito viruses

5851.84 --> 5855.119000000001
but there are unfortunately parasites

5854.639 --> 5858.56
though

5855.119 --> 5862.08
those are real right

5858.56 --> 5864.88
the malaria mosquitoes have a parasite

5862.08 --> 5866.719
in their saliva that's real it's very

5864.88 --> 5869.52
dangerous

5866.719 --> 5872.96
funny enough hydroxychloric and is the

5869.52 --> 5872.96
go-to medicine for that

5880.84 --> 5883.84
right

5889.52 --> 5894.080000000001
china has a space station now yeah so i
