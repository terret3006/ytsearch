0.86 --> 6.5600000000000005
so I hope you're hearing me right now I

7.519 --> 17.689999999999998
am recording I am streaming live if you

13.889 --> 17.689999999999998
can hear me please say so

33.27 --> 45.27
can you see me yes finally finally I can

38.25 --> 50.85
see myself here now to just get back to

45.27 --> 53.72
that you add there you go alright so

50.85 --> 53.72
welcome back

55.31 --> 61.59
yeah I had a hard crash I had to reset

58.83 --> 63.9
and just yeah unfortunately OBS had

61.59 --> 68.07000000000001
stopped the stream so this is a separate

63.9 --> 76.35
secondary well that's gonna be like 10

68.07 --> 79.47
minutes maybe but yeah that didn't it

76.35 --> 82.229
wasn't my internet this time so my

79.47 --> 84.36
computer just stopped working maybe it's

82.229 --> 87.24
because of all the moist because it is

84.36 --> 90.18
raining a lot today after all the heat

87.24 --> 92.36
maybe it just didn't take a liking to

90.18 --> 92.36000000000001
that

109.31 --> 116.0
oh I killed really I killed the hope

113.06 --> 124.19
series i fee convention Amsterdam is

116.0 --> 127.78999999999999
Saturday only now Wow okay well I guess

124.19 --> 130.31
that is the way he had solved it then I

127.79 --> 132.44
guess because I went to Saturday I think

130.31 --> 134.54
that probably most people went Saturday

132.44 --> 138.14
and didn't have enough for the other

134.54 --> 140.32999999999998
days so then he just said okay through

138.14 --> 143.45
Saturday so what good news then at least

140.33 --> 145.519
it's gonna happen and that means that it

143.45 --> 147.92
probably even more people are gonna be

145.519 --> 151.209
there eventually so looking forward to

147.92 --> 151.20899999999997
it Thanks thanks for the good news

155.62 --> 161.84
Ragnar Stefan hey listen you don't

159.29 --> 163.7
understand yxy the acceleration of

161.84 --> 165.95000000000002
gravity is a problem for Flat Earth well

163.7 --> 170.11999999999998
that is because you are attributing the

165.95 --> 172.16
acceleration to gravity which is not a

170.12 --> 176.48000000000002
proven thing you're approving you are

172.16 --> 180.65
attributing a empirical existing thing

176.48 --> 183.73899999999998
to a an aberration a phantom thing

180.65 --> 188.12
that's not proven that's the problem

183.739 --> 190.18
with it now to then completely deny

188.12 --> 193.13
force is taking place in the first place

190.18 --> 195.29000000000002
that was kind of a mistake but that's

193.13 --> 197.93
again it's what I originally did called

195.29 --> 202.82
gravity allergy it's the flat earth

197.93 --> 206.209
issue gravity allergy but yeah there's

202.82 --> 207.89
relative density and there's a lot of

206.209 --> 210.64000000000001
things going on

207.89 --> 216.35
concerning relative density theory

210.64 --> 219.64999999999998
spectrum the relative death density this

216.35 --> 222.2
equilibrium how it really works the

219.65 --> 224.57
medium how it's always about the object

222.2 --> 230.29899999999998
within the medium whatever the object

224.57 --> 233.959
maybe that's what is what makes it in

230.299 --> 237.56
equilibrium to be equal to the medium it

233.959 --> 240.26
is in and it rarely is because regular

237.56 --> 243.44
air even air pressure at the bottom of

240.26 --> 246.38
the earth is usually a lot

243.44 --> 250.79
higher in density than any type of solid

246.38 --> 253.22
object so it's never gonna find that

250.79 --> 255.35
equilibrium because the air that

253.22 --> 258.28
surrounds it even up on the point when

255.35 --> 260.65999999999997
it is blocked from traveling further is

258.28 --> 262.30999999999995
always gonna make it in this equilibrium

260.66 --> 265.37
and that is why you always then

262.31 --> 268.54
translate itself into pressure in the

265.37 --> 268.54
spot where it's at rest

280.25 --> 287.3
no no Ragnar why would we need to call

283.67 --> 290.90000000000003
that anything it's just the acceleration

287.3 --> 296.51
rate that's it what is the acceleration

290.9 --> 299.06
rate 9.8 meters per second squared

296.51 --> 302.77
that's it acceleration rate you don't

299.06 --> 302.77
need to call it anything

317.22 --> 320.42900000000003
[Music]

321.29 --> 328.87
right thanks oh and Dave Johnson

324.25 --> 331.3
buoyancy and gravity are basically two

328.87 --> 333.86
opposite elements of the same

331.3 --> 336.44
conceptualization and both are taken

333.86 --> 340.1
fully into account for in the relative

336.44 --> 341.78
density theory so they are unified in a

340.1 --> 345.47
relative density theory they don't even

341.78 --> 347.38
need to be separated like it is like it

345.47 --> 349.39000000000004
has happened with the gravity

347.38 --> 352.04
conceptualization where buoyancy is

349.39 --> 356.96
required to be a specific separate

352.04 --> 366.34000000000003
effect it's not needed in a relative

356.96 --> 368.69
density theory is no it's not a name

366.34 --> 371.21
it's not a name it's a description

368.69 --> 373.76
that's the issue you don't need a name

371.21 --> 375.95
you just say the acceleration rate

373.76 --> 378.76
because that is what it is

375.95 --> 378.76
it's not a name

398.88 --> 411.52
Nathan calls it Fred or you could just

404.74 --> 418.51
call it gravy I like I like changing it

411.52 --> 423.15
to gravy you just separate the it from

418.51 --> 423.15
the gravy concerning gravity

434.95 --> 437.52
all right

438.709 --> 446.449
okay I think that flutter debates are

443.579 --> 446.449
about to start

455.86 --> 461.51
right Nathan are are you yeah you are

458.96 --> 466.21
surprisingly late hanging around in my

461.51 --> 466.21
my chat so are you going live Nathan

480.03 --> 483.40999999999997
it would be nice to know

490.75 --> 497.19
Nathan are you going live with the

494.86 --> 497.19
debates

504.639 --> 510.849
oh you're going with the premier uncut

507.34 --> 518.11
is that it okay well anyway I'm gonna

510.849 --> 520.149
round out mm-hmm it's a very short

518.11 --> 528.4590000000001
segment I wish I could like stick them

520.149 --> 532.63
together after but yeah thanks everyone

528.459 --> 535.81
for coming and being really a really

532.63 --> 537.1899999999999
good chat today so thanks if you liked

535.81 --> 539.0189999999999
the video please don't forget to upload

537.19 --> 540.0100000000001
it and if you haven't already subscribe

539.019 --> 541.54
to my channel and hit the bell

540.01 --> 543.1
notification so you know when I'm going

541.54 --> 545.829
live which is normally 2:00 p.m.

543.1 --> 549.76
Amsterdam time every day although today

545.829 --> 553.7199999999999
I went came on a little early 12 minutes

549.76 --> 555.61
to make up for the pile of five minutes

553.72 --> 564.1600000000001
being late in the last two weeks

555.61 --> 568.269
one more hour God sorry I eat there's

564.16 --> 570.399
something else well but yes I will be

568.269 --> 575.17
back tomorrow with Flat Earth early bird

570.399 --> 580.959
number 262 hash tag meifa indeed uber

575.17 --> 584.56
Mukul and yeah tomorrow's gonna be

580.959 --> 586.81
Friday so right I don't think there's a

584.56 --> 588.67
light life Flat Earth debates right now

586.81 --> 596.3389999999999
but there is a replay from the after

588.67 --> 601.54
show so what else is up on Thursday I

596.339 --> 605.0500000000001
don't know anyway I will see you in the

601.54 --> 608.0999999999999
next video and until the next time keep

605.05 --> 608.0999999999999
it flat

608.87 --> 638.929
