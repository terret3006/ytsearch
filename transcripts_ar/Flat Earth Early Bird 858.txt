and yeah it's kind of nice and warm

130.0 --> 134.56
overall

131.039 --> 138.39999999999998
except well maybe outside when the sun

134.56 --> 138.4
is not out then maybe not so much

140.84 --> 143.84
right

144.08 --> 150.56
it's friday the 9th of april

147.56 --> 150.56
2021

154.239 --> 161.519
and yeah today as expected

158.239 --> 164.16
i got a shipment

161.519 --> 166.48000000000002
finally having come through after half a

164.16 --> 166.48
year

166.8 --> 171.84
uh tobacco it's finally here

172.56 --> 176.239
and holy [ __ ] is it a big bag i'd have

175.76 --> 178.72
to say

176.239 --> 180.959
it's not as well packaged as it was last

178.72 --> 180.959
time

181.44 --> 186.319
but this is a big freaking bag of

183.44 --> 186.319
tobacco guys

186.879 --> 191.12
i'm going to be supplied for at least

189.28 --> 193.68
the next year i'm kind of guaranteed

191.12 --> 193.68
about that

194.319 --> 202.07999999999998
so pretty cool already tried it out

199.68 --> 205.76000000000002
yeah though yeah this the the way they

202.08 --> 212.31900000000002
package it is just super messy

205.76 --> 215.84
so it wasn't vacuum packed

212.319 --> 217.44
i don't know if if it's

215.84 --> 219.36
happened during shipping that they

217.44 --> 222.07999999999998
literally just took it out

219.36 --> 222.959
to see if something illegal was in there

222.08 --> 226.48000000000002
or something

222.959 --> 229.36
and then put it in there

226.48 --> 230.39999999999998
not in which case yeah the the packaging

229.36 --> 232.48000000000002
system that

230.4 --> 235.519
this company applied i'm not really

232.48 --> 238.79899999999998
satisfied about it

235.519 --> 241.04
and in the future i will definitely

238.799 --> 242.08
go back to the other company for this

241.04 --> 244.56
although yeah

242.08 --> 246.799
tobacco is fine it's just the way they

244.56 --> 250.08
packaged it

246.799 --> 251.28
not great i would have preferred three

250.08 --> 254.56
separate

251.28 --> 256.56
air tight air sealed packages like with

254.56 --> 259.199
the other shipment

256.56 --> 262.32
with the other supplier but you're happy

259.199 --> 262.32
to finally have that

262.56 --> 268.56
hey hello brand m good to see you first

265.28 --> 271.44
in chat

268.56 --> 271.44
yeah so that's

271.919 --> 282.56
like i think it's like three pounds

276.24 --> 285.919
a lot

282.56 --> 289.12
nice need to find one of them well

285.919 --> 291.35999999999996
if you want to find one of them you have

289.12 --> 294.8
to keep in mind that

291.36 --> 295.44
the shipping is just insane like there's

294.8 --> 298.32
a lot of

295.44 --> 300.56
extra costs so if if you're in the

298.32 --> 301.59999999999997
united states or canada or wherever they

300.56 --> 304.8
are

301.6 --> 309.12
it's going to be dirt chief but

304.8 --> 312.639
yeah i had to basically pay almost 50

309.12 --> 316.08
extra for all the different shipping and

312.639 --> 320.16
taxes and whatever

316.08 --> 323.44
customs fees and all that crap

320.16 --> 325.6
so yeah and they

323.44 --> 326.88
and they stack it with the entire entire

325.6 --> 330.32000000000005
price so it's like

326.88 --> 331.12
yeah you're being robbed but at least

330.32 --> 335.199
it's clean

331.12 --> 335.199
organically grown tobacco

335.36 --> 339.84000000000003
no additives

340.0 --> 344.639
i hope also dreaming about the future

343.199 --> 348.16
when i have no garden

344.639 --> 348.16
i'm definitely gonna try to

348.639 --> 353.52
cultivate tobacco myself and see how

351.52 --> 355.19899999999996
that is possible in this type of climate

353.52 --> 357.59999999999997
i probably need some kind of greenhouse

355.199 --> 357.6
for that

358.16 --> 363.44
and i'm not on a large scale but just to

360.88 --> 363.44
get my own

364.84 --> 370.08
leaves

366.8 --> 370.08
all right hellotomenoid

374.4 --> 382.08
right but yeah

378.479 --> 384.88
so kind of happy about that

382.08 --> 384.88
and relieved

385.199 --> 389.91900000000004
like even till last minute that it

387.6 --> 394.56
wasn't due to delivery guy who

389.919 --> 399.28
barely couldn't really speak dutch

394.56 --> 402.0
but just felt like man's taking so long

399.28 --> 403.039
i need to be careful like i don't know

402.0 --> 406.0
what the hell they've

403.039 --> 408.31899999999996
done in all this time at shipping that

406.0 --> 410.08
it took like half a year because the

408.319 --> 414.639
actual transport

410.08 --> 416.8
like took maybe a few weeks

414.639 --> 418.16
and the rest of the time it's just been

416.8 --> 420.84000000000003
waiting there for

418.16 --> 422.40000000000003
months and months and it's totally

420.84 --> 425.35999999999996
insane

422.4 --> 427.919
not happy about that part but at least i

425.36 --> 427.91900000000004
got it now

428.319 --> 432.08000000000004
i'll take that for what it's worth

435.12 --> 439.44
and i'm very glad to finally be able to

437.12 --> 440.56
switch away from the regular tobacco

439.44 --> 443.52
which is just

440.56 --> 444.24
insanely expensive like it's gone up in

443.52 --> 446.88
price

444.24 --> 451.039
even further it just keeps this like

446.88 --> 454.71999999999997
this inflation happening

451.039 --> 455.919
maybe yeah tobacco prices because of the

454.72 --> 459.12
taxes it's

455.919 --> 462.31899999999996
like i don't know man it's

459.12 --> 465.84000000000003
a lot of taxes they they put on it

462.319 --> 465.84000000000003
over here

467.52 --> 470.4
all right anyway

470.96 --> 474.31899999999996
yeah they try to but i don't know man

472.879 --> 476.319
like in the netherlands there's

474.319 --> 477.52000000000004
just this policy where they literally

476.319 --> 480.16
from liberal

477.52 --> 481.44
top down try to ban smoking entirely

480.16 --> 483.52000000000004
like completely ban

481.44 --> 483.52
it

485.28 --> 490.479
and of course they have started doing

488.4 --> 493.35999999999996
that at working places and

490.479 --> 494.479
cafes haha remember those cafes before

493.36 --> 497.44
corona

494.479 --> 497.44
right and all that

501.68 --> 506.24
but yeah i think that the future for

504.24 --> 507.68
tobacco is literally just growing it

506.24 --> 511.44
yourself

507.68 --> 513.76
and with the the growing

511.44 --> 516.08
technologies that are widely available

513.76 --> 518.64
now not that hard to gather

516.08 --> 521.839
it should be much more doable than say a

518.64 --> 521.8389999999999
hundred years ago

523.12 --> 530.64
fifty dollars a pack in australia what

526.56 --> 535.8389999999999
that's really at 50 australian dollars

530.64 --> 535.8389999999999
that's bizarre

535.92 --> 541.68
in australia no less it should be really

538.16 --> 544.56
easy to actually grow it there

541.68 --> 544.56
that's crazy

545.68 --> 563.8389999999999
right anyway

548.8 --> 563.8389999999999
that happened

564.32 --> 569.519
it's illegal what to grow your own

574.839 --> 577.839
tobacco

588.839 --> 591.839
what

602.839 --> 605.839
what

607.519 --> 619.839
that makes very little sense to me

629.12 --> 633.44
all right guess i'll have to take your

631.6 --> 637.0400000000001
word on that rocket blimps

633.44 --> 637.0400000000001
but sounds quite insane

638.24 --> 640.72
anyway

643.2 --> 647.839
got my green tea here

649.92 --> 653.92
other states differ all right

656.399 --> 662.24
five dope plants it's called cannabis

660.0 --> 663.92
rocket limbs it's called cannabis right

662.24 --> 666.399
so that's the

663.92 --> 667.68
that sounds very similar to the dutch

666.399 --> 670.72
policy

667.68 --> 673.4399999999999
where you can have your own plants but

670.72 --> 674.64
limited amount well why not apply that

673.44 --> 677.2790000000001
then

674.64 --> 678.16
instead of just outright banning growing

677.279 --> 681.2
a plant which

678.16 --> 681.1999999999999
is just ridiculous

681.279 --> 685.519
how about just doing the same system

683.839 --> 688.8000000000001
like okay a person can grow

685.519 --> 689.6
five tobacco plants in a year something

688.8 --> 693.04
similar

689.6 --> 695.519
right because it's cheaper it's

693.04 --> 695.519
cleaner

696.399 --> 700.64
and that will take down some of the

700.0 --> 703.2
medical

700.64 --> 704.48
costs which are the supposed threat why

703.2 --> 707.6
there has to be cracked

704.48 --> 709.9200000000001
down on tobacco even though it could

707.6 --> 713.6800000000001
probably be argued that most of the

709.92 --> 713.68
problems arriving from

713.8 --> 717.12
tobacco-related diseases rather come

716.0 --> 720.16
from the

717.12 --> 723.44
standardized production systems

720.16 --> 725.12
and the additives in that tobacco

723.44 --> 727.9200000000001
companies

725.12 --> 728.9590000000001
use as a standard not all of them are as

727.92 --> 731.8389999999999
bad but still

728.959 --> 731.8389999999999
like

736.16 --> 740.16
the punishment would be minor okay fine

739.04 --> 742.399
rocket blimp

740.16 --> 744.24
i i don't know a lot about how how that

742.399 --> 744.72
works in the netherlands i'm just i mean

744.24 --> 748.0
in

744.72 --> 749.2
australia i'm just giving out

748.0 --> 752.48
suggestions of

749.2 --> 752.48
how i would arrange it

755.68 --> 761.279
most people vape now while vaping is not

758.24 --> 761.279
without its problems

767.44 --> 774.32
right so it's gonna just yield more

771.279 --> 777.12
different problems then

774.32 --> 777.12
right anyway

781.36 --> 787.839
prince philip has died really

788.32 --> 792.72
okay let's see if that's [ __ ]

796.48 --> 803.44
oh yeah he has oh [ __ ]

800.56 --> 805.5999999999999
well you know what he wished for he

803.44 --> 808.8000000000001
wanted to reincarnate as a virus so i

805.6 --> 808.8000000000001
guess he's getting his wish

810.24 --> 815.839
sort of

826.959 --> 831.3599999999999
all right wow that just happened didn't

829.279 --> 831.36
it

836.32 --> 843.839
well prince i hope it was worth it

843.92 --> 848.88
i'm gonna pass judgment

848.959 --> 857.8389999999999
but i think that everybody knows where

850.8 --> 857.8389999999999
that guy's going

874.16 --> 879.8389999999999
no don't believe anything to do with cry

877.04 --> 879.8389999999999
never said that

883.6 --> 890.8000000000001
now it no i i don't know

887.36 --> 893.1990000000001
i haven't looked up the news report in

890.8 --> 895.8389999999999
detail

893.199 --> 898.959
we'll be hearing about that today i'm

895.839 --> 901.12
pretty sure we will

898.959 --> 902.959
like i know alex jones is going to be

901.12 --> 906.0
all over it doing his thing

902.959 --> 908.0
basically sending him off to hell as

906.0 --> 913.36
alex jones likes to do with these types

908.0 --> 916.079
of figures

913.36 --> 916.9590000000001
but yeah that always stuck to mind that

916.079 --> 919.8389999999999
he said that

916.959 --> 922.399
like prince philip notorious for having

919.839 --> 925.0400000000001
said oh when i die i want to reincarnate

922.399 --> 927.519
as a virus

925.04 --> 929.76
finally get rid of this pesky humanity

927.519 --> 929.76
well

931.839 --> 936.8000000000001
it just seems like he's gonna get his

934.48 --> 936.8000000000001
wish

938.839 --> 941.839
uh

943.35 --> 950.0
[Music]

946.639 --> 950.0
all right tiny one we're good

952.48 --> 969.279
now i was referring to myself when it

954.48 --> 972.0
comes to passing judgment

969.279 --> 972.48
although yeah as i suggested it's kind

972.0 --> 974.32
of like

972.48 --> 976.8000000000001
pointing at the obvious at this point

974.32 --> 980.8000000000001
like this was not a good man

976.8 --> 982.16
right i doubt that anybody thinks that

980.8 --> 997.8389999999999
he is

982.16 --> 997.8389999999999
or was

999.6 --> 1007.1990000000001
all right okay well there you go

1003.6 --> 1011.839
i got my tobacco prince philip died

1007.199 --> 1011.8389999999999
what else is new

1014.56 --> 1019.92
he's moved to the outer spaces really

1020.8 --> 1025.839
you really think he's not dead come on

1031.589 --> 1037.769
[Music]

1048.0 --> 1051.84
all right yeah seeking star where you

1049.76 --> 1067.84
asked if it was the cause i don't know

1051.84 --> 1067.84
hasn't i haven't

1086.08 --> 1095.84
oh christ

1133.12 --> 1137.84
wait one

1175.039 --> 1181.52
oh wait this is an older article

1178.48 --> 1181.52
16th of march

1181.76 --> 1186.16
right so there's not too much news out

1184.24 --> 1193.84
about it

1186.16 --> 1193.8400000000001
let me just take a look at this

1212.0 --> 1214.4
wow

1218.0 --> 1225.2
okay they're not they're not saying why

1222.32 --> 1228.6399999999999
i i'm not getting any info from these

1225.2 --> 1228.64
articles as to the cause

1228.96 --> 1234.98
they're even saying like oh he was such

1230.559 --> 1238.73
a good health for his age that's it

1234.98 --> 1238.73
[Music]

1241.919 --> 1245.76
maybe it ah yeah it's just stupid

1243.84 --> 1247.52
speculation who really cares you know

1245.76 --> 1251.12
but i'm thinking like

1247.52 --> 1252.48
for at that age having had infections

1251.12 --> 1254.6399999999999
and all that

1252.48 --> 1256.72
in march that was a previous article so

1254.64 --> 1259.8400000000001
he was kind of like teetering

1256.72 --> 1262.24
at old age with his health he might have

1259.84 --> 1264.72
just gotten

1262.24 --> 1265.6
like very typical pneumonia or something

1264.72 --> 1270.24
and died

1265.6 --> 1270.24
very quickly i don't know

1272.4 --> 1277.8400000000001
what the hell

1288.84 --> 1291.84
dude

1293.919 --> 1304.7990000000002
what are you wait what

1297.6 --> 1308.9599999999998
you're doing that rocket blimps

1304.799 --> 1308.96
we might have been a little bit hastily

1316.84 --> 1333.84
there

1319.76 --> 1333.84
okay and how is that working out for you

1339.6 --> 1343.52
so does nathan i don't know if he does

1344.84 --> 1348.48
that

1346.39 --> 1350.96
[Music]

1348.48 --> 1352.88
i don't think so i think he might have

1350.96 --> 1354.64
tried it there i think a lot of people

1352.88 --> 1361.3600000000001
tried it

1354.64 --> 1363.039
like when yeah in the earlier days

1361.36 --> 1366.799
i doubt there's still a lot of people

1363.039 --> 1366.799
that are constantly doing that though

1367.919 --> 1372.24
but maybe i'm wrong maybe he did do it

1370.159 --> 1376.0800000000002
he's still doing i don't know man

1372.24 --> 1376.08
why don't you ask him see what happens

1381.52 --> 1384.8799999999999
i saw a vid he made yeah i know as i

1384.48 --> 1387.1200000000001
said

1384.88 --> 1389.8400000000001
in the past he i'm pretty sure he has

1387.12 --> 1389.84
tried it

1400.24 --> 1417.84
all right i don't know why you bring

1402.799 --> 1417.84
this up though

1419.84 --> 1426.559
right so it's a little side note

1424.0 --> 1428.84
i'm kind of i just want to say that i'm

1426.559 --> 1431.84
kind of pissed off with

1428.84 --> 1431.84
rt

1432.72 --> 1440.0
because of the way well

1436.159 --> 1443.44
their composure like rt seems like very

1440.0 --> 1445.76
much into medical industrial conspiracy

1443.44 --> 1447.919
like they're they seem to be very much a

1445.76 --> 1451.24
part of that

1447.919 --> 1453.279
they're like distinct anti-va like

1451.24 --> 1457.76
anti-anti-vaxxers

1453.279 --> 1460.48
and they're like deleting any descent

1457.76 --> 1461.2
in the comment sections too like very

1460.48 --> 1464.799
telling

1461.2 --> 1467.919
creepy as [ __ ] and evil

1464.799 --> 1467.9189999999999
not happy about that

1470.0 --> 1474.799
right and there was this article where

1473.12 --> 1477.84
it basically suggested that

1474.799 --> 1477.84
europe is now

1478.559 --> 1481.6
that european courts have basically

1480.96 --> 1484.72
started

1481.6 --> 1486.9599999999998
mandating vaccines

1484.72 --> 1490.24
and i don't know how much of this is

1486.96 --> 1490.24
like a grappler bluff

1491.2 --> 1501.8400000000001
but that is just totally messed up

1495.44 --> 1501.8400000000001
if that's all true

1515.85 --> 1518.9199999999998
[Music]

1521.2 --> 1529.8400000000001
huh okay seeking star wars

1525.84 --> 1529.84
oh yeah he's got a lot of trolls so

1564.33 --> 1567.47
[Music]

1567.52 --> 1571.84
right so let's just move on

1573.919 --> 1577.3600000000001
is anybody else here in chat

1578.559 --> 1582.08
right so yesterday

1582.32 --> 1586.0
flat earth debates were good and i was

1584.72 --> 1588.64
present

1586.0 --> 1588.64
a lot of it

1589.279 --> 1592.4
it wasn't good for him

1593.6 --> 1600.6399999999999
after that gary and terry own benjamin

1597.279 --> 1613.84
was live it was great

1600.64 --> 1613.8400000000001
it's good stuff

1614.08 --> 1620.8799999999999
yeah i was talking a lot about like the

1617.12 --> 1625.4399999999998
the types again like alphas betas gammas

1620.88 --> 1627.8400000000001
and omegas laying that out like

1625.44 --> 1629.159
that's very interesting i i like that

1627.84 --> 1632.08
like

1629.159 --> 1634.64
characterizing or what you say like the

1632.08 --> 1637.9189999999999
division of types of characters based on

1634.64 --> 1640.64
just their impulses and all that

1637.919 --> 1642.159
it's an interesting system so i always

1640.64 --> 1644.24
appreciate it

1642.159 --> 1645.44
when that's brought back up it's like a

1644.24 --> 1649.279
sort of

1645.44 --> 1654.0
a map character map

1649.279 --> 1656.399
so yeah own benjamin was great

1654.0 --> 1656.399
and

1658.88 --> 1664.3200000000002
yeah sometimes i think like he's just

1662.08 --> 1665.1999999999998
giving like these extra messages through

1664.32 --> 1668.32
it's weird

1665.2 --> 1669.3600000000001
to experience that like sometimes i

1668.32 --> 1672.8799999999999
think owen best

1669.36 --> 1672.8799999999999
benjamin really tries to

1674.559 --> 1678.32
hide private messages

1678.799 --> 1684.96
towards like categories of people that

1682.159 --> 1687.1200000000001
he's suspecting or knowing that follows

1684.96 --> 1687.1200000000001
him

1687.76 --> 1692.1589999999999
and i pick up on when he does that

1690.48 --> 1692.88
sometimes i think like he's even

1692.159 --> 1695.919
directing

1692.88 --> 1698.5590000000002
things halfway at myself but that might

1695.919 --> 1701.6000000000001
be a mistake

1698.559 --> 1702.1589999999999
i don't think he's literally just a cold

1701.6 --> 1704.8799999999999
machine

1702.159 --> 1707.679
messaging me personally that that seems

1704.88 --> 1710.5590000000002
a little over the top

1707.679 --> 1712.0800000000002
but it's just a lot of it's it's very

1710.559 --> 1715.12
interesting watching his shows

1712.08 --> 1715.12
and he's very funny

1715.679 --> 1725.8400000000001
he blinks in morse code

1727.2 --> 1729.76
what the

1730.96 --> 1736.72
right so yeah also

1734.08 --> 1737.279
kind of stood out yesterday over at alex

1736.72 --> 1740.88
jones

1737.279 --> 1742.799
ted nugent coming on there and

1740.88 --> 1744.3200000000002
i've seen him on before and he's just

1742.799 --> 1747.2
like

1744.32 --> 1747.2
this certain type

1747.919 --> 1754.3200000000002
and there's a lot of weirdness

1751.12 --> 1757.279
to that guy but

1754.32 --> 1758.799
yeah it's it's so hard to describe like

1757.279 --> 1762.08
that guy

1758.799 --> 1764.24
he's not perfect but he's been kind of

1762.08 --> 1768.0
studying up

1764.24 --> 1772.88
it seems and he was like in really good

1768.0 --> 1775.44
form and energy this time and

1772.88 --> 1775.919
it seems like he's really tapped into

1775.44 --> 1777.6000000000001
well

1775.919 --> 1781.8400000000001
level kind of in the direction of what

1777.6 --> 1781.84
i'm seeking

1782.32 --> 1786.6399999999999
and yeah this is of course because going

1785.039 --> 1788.96
at it with alex jones

1786.64 --> 1790.3990000000001
who also talks about that sort of things

1788.96 --> 1794.159
and the

1790.399 --> 1795.52
psychonauts like teleporting to other

1794.159 --> 1799.0390000000002
dimensions

1795.52 --> 1802.1589999999999
and yeah alex is very fascinated by that

1799.039 --> 1808.32
so that kind of also brings out the

1802.159 --> 1810.24
spiritual mechanisms

1808.32 --> 1812.1589999999999
and ted nugent was very much into that

1810.24 --> 1813.76
so i thought it was a really interesting

1812.159 --> 1823.8400000000001
show with him

1813.76 --> 1823.84
or well it was interesting enough

1827.279 --> 1830.559
all right just get the feeling there's a

1829.679 --> 1834.48
lot of people

1830.559 --> 1837.279
really trying out trying to recognize

1834.48 --> 1839.2
the mechanism of the the path of christ

1837.279 --> 1842.48
the thing that i'm doing

1839.2 --> 1844.88
and not getting it from me

1842.48 --> 1846.0
or anything that i'm suspecting it's

1844.88 --> 1848.3200000000002
just something that's

1846.0 --> 1850.559
arising and a lot of people are picking

1848.32 --> 1853.6
up on it and just

1850.559 --> 1855.52
through neighboring echoes so everybody

1853.6 --> 1858.6399999999999
it's like the 100 monkey effect

1855.52 --> 1860.08
one could say everybody

1858.64 --> 1862.159
is starting to figure it out

1860.08 --> 1864.08
simultaneously and as everybody's

1862.159 --> 1865.8400000000001
figuring out

1864.08 --> 1867.76
through the internet to you can look

1865.84 --> 1869.9189999999999
very broad or have people

1867.76 --> 1871.76
next to you that look very broad and

1869.919 --> 1873.44
then relay what they've seen in a

1871.76 --> 1878.0
concentrated form

1873.44 --> 1880.559
and then so there's just this

1878.0 --> 1882.08
quick realization system because of the

1880.559 --> 1885.6
internet

1882.08 --> 1888.24
and social media if you have

1885.6 --> 1888.799
if you have the strength basically to

1888.24 --> 1891.039
not get

1888.799 --> 1892.6399999999999
lost in it all lose yourself in it

1891.039 --> 1895.76
because that can happen too

1892.64 --> 1898.24
and it just seems like ted

1895.76 --> 1900.32
kind of level up maybe but who knows

1898.24 --> 1903.36
he's kind of a wild person

1900.32 --> 1905.4399999999998
many ways so you never really know

1903.36 --> 1907.039
that that's kind of like my personal

1905.44 --> 1908.88
approach

1907.039 --> 1910.32
but it was it was kind of good to see

1908.88 --> 1913.1200000000001
him like that

1910.32 --> 1913.84
it just stood out to me yeah so not

1913.12 --> 1915.76
saying oh

1913.84 --> 1917.12
he's now the best or whatever it's just

1915.76 --> 1919.679
saying like whoa

1917.12 --> 1921.6789999999999
felt like he's really found something

1919.679 --> 1926.0
good

1921.679 --> 1930.0
anyway sort of a gun maniac

1926.0 --> 1935.84
well yeah well that's good

1930.0 --> 1935.84
i like that

1944.24 --> 1952.32
like he's trying to well

1948.24 --> 1955.279
build just honor

1952.32 --> 1956.799
lost traditions finding the spiritual

1955.279 --> 1959.84
power within them

1956.799 --> 1960.08
and this is like it's not a joke these

1959.84 --> 1962.799
th

1960.08 --> 1964.24
that's real and some of these things

1962.799 --> 1966.399
that he described i've

1964.24 --> 1967.679
experienced similar things in my own way

1966.399 --> 1971.12
that's real

1967.679 --> 1973.679
you can't fake that you could

1971.12 --> 1975.6
well you could try to fake that but then

1973.679 --> 1976.48
people that have actually been through

1975.6 --> 1979.1999999999998
that will

1976.48 --> 1980.799
know that that you're faking that in

1979.2 --> 1982.24
that moment other people that haven't

1980.799 --> 1984.08
experienced it

1982.24 --> 1985.6
they won't see it they will just see oh

1984.08 --> 1987.36
that's that story

1985.6 --> 1988.7199999999998
but there's more than just the story

1987.36 --> 1990.7199999999998
there's also

1988.72 --> 1991.919
the energy correlating with the

1990.72 --> 1994.159
conscious spirit

1991.919 --> 1996.3200000000002
also explaining it but it's also what

1994.159 --> 1998.7990000000002
are they radiating these things are very

1996.32 --> 1998.799
distinct

2000.559 --> 2005.84
so yeah i know i was impressed

2015.84 --> 2021.12
owen benjamin has now declared the bear

2018.88 --> 2024.64
church the gamma bear church i thought

2021.12 --> 2024.6399999999999
that was kind of funny too by the way

2025.84 --> 2033.84
she's all puzzling out like how is this

2028.399 --> 2033.84
gonna grow out of control

2038.88 --> 2043.8400000000001
hey james mason good to see you stallion

2044.84 --> 2050.3199999999997
8012.

2046.72 --> 2053.44
doing good it's a little tense

2050.32 --> 2055.52
but not too bad my shoulders still

2053.44 --> 2058.48
doing better it's not completely over

2055.52 --> 2058.48
yet but overall

2059.28 --> 2066.2400000000002
it's now maybe like 30

2062.72 --> 2066.24
of what it was two weeks ago

2066.96 --> 2070.56
so it is gradually going away also very

2069.76 --> 2073.679
noticeable

2070.56 --> 2074.159
other issues have started to arrive so

2073.679 --> 2076.7200000000003
it

2074.159 --> 2078.0
it really sometimes to me is like these

2076.72 --> 2080.1589999999997
issues

2078.0 --> 2082.72
resolving themselves resulting in the

2080.159 --> 2082.7200000000003
symptoms

2082.8 --> 2086.0
it's like a tape and once you get over

2085.119 --> 2088.0
one problem

2086.0 --> 2089.679
it moves on to the next to find a

2088.0 --> 2092.159
solution for that

2089.679 --> 2093.119
and it's just yeah if you got a whole

2092.159 --> 2094.639
bunch of things

2093.119 --> 2096.96
that you're bumping into with your

2094.639 --> 2098.6400000000003
spirit struggling personal resolve

2096.96 --> 2100.48
struggle

2098.64 --> 2103.839
there's going to be a lot of those types

2100.48 --> 2103.839
of things coming in a row

2104.72 --> 2108.3999999999996
it's very important that you don't seek

2108.079 --> 2112.96
out

2108.4 --> 2112.96
more basically issues

2113.359 --> 2117.839
the right response is it's puzzling

2120.72 --> 2131.839
rocket lamps we please stop bringing

2122.56 --> 2131.839
that up

2142.839 --> 2145.839
so

2149.74 --> 2154.16
[Music]

2151.28 --> 2155.0400000000004
all right uh yeah i hung around at

2154.16 --> 2158.8799999999997
brandon's

2155.04 --> 2161.44
not only in chat though

2158.88 --> 2162.96
because yeah he had his dream life and

2161.44 --> 2166.56
rompus got on there again

2162.96 --> 2166.56
and it was really funny

2167.359 --> 2171.52
so i kind of listened to that in the

2168.88 --> 2173.839
background and it was rounding up my

2171.52 --> 2173.839
my day

2186.24 --> 2190.56
and that's it that's pretty much what i

2187.599 --> 2190.56
was doing yesterday

2198.839 --> 2204.96
right

2201.359 --> 2208.24
so is there anything you guys

2204.96 --> 2208.2400000000002
want me to talk about

2213.52 --> 2229.839
have any questions

2235.44 --> 2240.64
all right and yeah just notice that the

2238.56 --> 2243.839
flat earth man has a new

2240.64 --> 2243.839
music video

2266.079 --> 2271.8390000000004
yes sally in 80 12 somebody already

2268.32 --> 2271.839
brought it up

2272.24 --> 2275.5989999999997
there's very little information released

2274.32 --> 2277.839
about it though

2275.599 --> 2281.2000000000003
they're not even saying a cause or a

2277.839 --> 2281.2
presumed cause or anything

2281.44 --> 2285.839
but yes i know that

2292.31 --> 2295.48
[Music]

2305.97 --> 2310.2389999999996
[Music]

2310.839 --> 2327.839
okay

2312.079 --> 2327.8390000000004
hey george sanford

2330.24 --> 2334.0789999999997
oh and james mason yeah i had to refresh

2332.32 --> 2341.839
my youtube page just some

2334.079 --> 2341.8390000000004
chat didn't show up

2349.2 --> 2355.839
okay rocket blimps

2362.64 --> 2366.8799999999997
oh right yeah seeking star wars oh you

2365.359 --> 2370.3199999999997
don't hear about that very much

2366.88 --> 2375.04
well that

2370.32 --> 2377.119
has been out there for decades now

2375.04 --> 2380.4
it's like even in the early flat earth

2377.119 --> 2384.32
days 2015 and 14

2380.4 --> 2389.6800000000003
that video was passed around

2384.32 --> 2391.839
right the super saiy line layer

2389.68 --> 2394.3199999999997
where yeah the submarine tried to get

2391.839 --> 2397.839
through it and bumped off it

2394.32 --> 2397.839
because it didn't couldn't get in

2398.079 --> 2401.44
yeah that video has been out for a while

2400.88 --> 2404.6400000000003
i

2401.44 --> 2407.92
have a weird memory where i saw that in

2404.64 --> 2409.5989999999997
the 90s even so

2407.92 --> 2412.48
but i'm not sure if that was in the

2409.599 --> 2412.48
physical realm

2419.76 --> 2422.96
it's so weird man like i have memories

2422.16 --> 2425.359
still and it's

2422.96 --> 2426.2400000000002
it must be kind of dark world related

2425.359 --> 2429.359
where i would see

2426.24 --> 2432.72
videos on the

2429.359 --> 2436.0
television in the house where i

2432.72 --> 2439.359
lived back then when like

2436.0 --> 2442.8
where is that coming from

2439.359 --> 2444.0789999999997
how is that even possible but that's

2442.8 --> 2445.92
something that i've been trying to

2444.079 --> 2448.319
figure out afterward

2445.92 --> 2449.92
and realizing like wow that experience

2448.319 --> 2452.16
might simply have

2449.92 --> 2453.6800000000003
not been in the physical reality and i

2452.16 --> 2455.359
didn't even realize it

2453.68 --> 2458.48
that it was like a holographic

2455.359 --> 2458.48
constructed dream

2460.079 --> 2467.6800000000003
and that it was almost meant to trick me

2463.2 --> 2469.839
into believing that that was real

2467.68 --> 2470.96
like that it was act that it actually

2469.839 --> 2473.44
physically happened

2470.96 --> 2474.079
in time-based reality that that was part

2473.44 --> 2477.119
of the trick

2474.079 --> 2479.2000000000003
to try to see if i would believe

2477.119 --> 2481.359
and start echoing it from out of the

2479.2 --> 2482.56
dream when i didn't have physical

2481.359 --> 2484.319
evidence for it

2482.56 --> 2486.48
that would make me at the time would

2484.319 --> 2489.839
have made me absolutely sound like

2486.48 --> 2493.359
wow you're crazy you've seen this

2489.839 --> 2496.64
well nobody's seen that because

2493.359 --> 2497.5989999999997
that's not on the television how did you

2496.64 --> 2500.16
see that

2497.599 --> 2502.319
and then me like if i would have stuck

2500.16 --> 2503.92
to trying to reify that into physical

2502.319 --> 2506.079
reality it would have been like oh my

2503.92 --> 2510.079
god i might be crazy

2506.079 --> 2512.1600000000003
that's why i never really spoke of these

2510.079 --> 2517.8390000000004
things

2512.16 --> 2517.839
up until pretty much five years ago

2519.359 --> 2524.56
before that i've been just trying to

2522.319 --> 2527.2799999999997
look at it at a distance and just

2524.56 --> 2527.68
kind of wonder silently like was that

2527.28 --> 2530.96
real

2527.68 --> 2533.7599999999998
was that real was that real

2530.96 --> 2534.16
why do those moments stand out so much

2533.76 --> 2537.2000000000003
when

2534.16 --> 2539.7599999999998
in general my memories of just daily

2537.2 --> 2541.68
life in that period were really not

2539.76 --> 2542.8
that intense and they haven't stuck to

2541.68 --> 2551.839
mind as much

2542.8 --> 2551.8390000000004
how can that be it's weird

2559.119 --> 2563.76
right and one of the more distinct

2561.68 --> 2567.04
memories of this is

2563.76 --> 2568.65
having been shown like a

2567.04 --> 2570.16
balloon launch video

2568.65 --> 2572.56
[Music]

2570.16 --> 2573.5989999999997
on what i thought was kind of like an

2572.56 --> 2576.88
iphone like an

2573.599 --> 2578.7200000000003
entire screen based telephone and like

2576.88 --> 2581.359
in the 90s

2578.72 --> 2581.359
like what

2582.079 --> 2585.76
and i even vaguely remember them

2584.0 --> 2587.359
bragging like yeah this is like an

2585.76 --> 2589.28
iphone

2587.359 --> 2591.52
it's so much better as everything that's

2589.28 --> 2596.4
here

2591.52 --> 2596.4
i i'm not really i wasn't interested

2596.88 --> 2607.839
yeah dark world visions eh weird stuff

2626.0 --> 2631.28
blue planet right yes seeking star well

2630.16 --> 2634.0789999999997
there is a blue

2631.28 --> 2635.2000000000003
planet episode i've seen it myself on

2634.079 --> 2636.96
netflix

2635.2 --> 2638.7999999999997
because that's there that it's over

2636.96 --> 2642.2400000000002
there too

2638.8 --> 2643.599
about the super saiy line layer they did

2642.24 --> 2646.839
studies on that

2643.599 --> 2649.839
it's it's fascinating like it's not

2646.839 --> 2649.839
impenetrable

2660.56 --> 2664.319
like they showed like how these weird

2662.96 --> 2667.28
kind of wormy

2664.319 --> 2669.52
creatures were hanging around there

2667.28 --> 2674.2400000000002
constantly

2669.52 --> 2676.88
and sometimes like they like they could

2674.24 --> 2678.3999999999996
get caught in the super saline layer and

2676.88 --> 2681.599
then you they would literally

2678.4 --> 2682.079
literally start to squirm because the

2681.599 --> 2684.2400000000002
salt

2682.079 --> 2685.599
was presumably damaging them and they

2684.24 --> 2688.72
would try to

2685.599 --> 2690.319
wriggle their way free and get out again

2688.72 --> 2694.16
and sometimes they couldn't and then

2690.319 --> 2694.16
they just died and sank into it

2696.88 --> 2705.839
did is that the thing that you saw from

2700.319 --> 2705.839
blue planet seeking star wars

2719.34 --> 2722.3990000000003
[Music]

2749.92 --> 2753.44
he was comparing it to the ferment well

2752.0 --> 2755.839
that's just silly

2753.44 --> 2758.16
if he does that then he's stuck into

2755.839 --> 2759.359
very old ideas that make no freaking

2758.16 --> 2761.839
sense

2759.359 --> 2761.839
that's fine

2762.96 --> 2769.28
because i'm pretty sure that super

2764.48 --> 2769.28
saline water is just super sailing water

2772.319 --> 2777.7599999999998
it's not a barrier

2775.44 --> 2779.92
right it's not a container barrier that

2777.76 --> 2783.2000000000003
could sustain

2779.92 --> 2785.76
pressure so it's within the container

2783.2 --> 2788.3999999999996
all of it

2785.76 --> 2791.119
and so to say oh that has to do with the

2788.4 --> 2793.359
firmament that's stupid

2791.119 --> 2796.8
because the firmament has to be able to

2793.359 --> 2796.7999999999997
contain the pressure

2797.119 --> 2803.839
liquids are not gonna do that

2811.2 --> 2814.839
send in james cameron you get to the

2813.599 --> 2820.4
bottom of it

2814.839 --> 2820.4
okay i'm sure he's gonna try

2825.28 --> 2830.88
like who knows man who knows

2828.56 --> 2831.92
what you'll find down there like there

2830.88 --> 2835.44
might be these

2831.92 --> 2839.04
really huge super saiyan

2835.44 --> 2841.359
drenched caverns even beneath

2839.04 --> 2843.359
like where these holes or some of them

2841.359 --> 2845.52
will just be dead end holes where the

2843.359 --> 2846.5589999999997
super saiyan water sits in but who knows

2845.52 --> 2850.24
maybe there are like

2846.559 --> 2850.2400000000002
openings to sub

2850.559 --> 2856.1600000000003
like even sub ocean bottom

2853.68 --> 2858.7999999999997
spaces where it's just completely filled

2856.16 --> 2873.839
with that stuff

2858.8 --> 2873.8390000000004
who knows what is down there

2879.6 --> 2883.929
[Music]

2896.93 --> 2900.1099999999997
[Music]

2904.96 --> 2908.16
of course it's interesting

2911.04 --> 2915.44
strange natural phenomena are always

2914.16 --> 2917.359
interesting

2915.44 --> 2920.4
you know one of these things that's also

2917.359 --> 2923.359
extremely bizarre to me and interesting

2920.4 --> 2924.4
and not the only one that thinks that is

2923.359 --> 2927.839
that certain

2924.4 --> 2930.96
that the oceans seem to be separated

2927.839 --> 2930.96
almost like cells

2932.24 --> 2937.9199999999996
there have like distinct separations and

2935.68 --> 2938.8799999999997
it stays like that it doesn't start to

2937.92 --> 2942.4
mix in now

2938.88 --> 2946.2400000000002
that is really bizarre

2942.4 --> 2949.119
because that's not another layer

2946.24 --> 2951.04
down there no that's just right in the

2949.119 --> 2953.359
ocean

2951.04 --> 2956.24
and you can see it because of the

2953.359 --> 2971.839
difference in colors on either sides

2956.24 --> 2971.839
that is weird

2994.559 --> 3001.8390000000004
seeing super saline water like sodium

2998.16 --> 3001.839
chloride in water i don't know

3010.839 --> 3014.88
probably

3012.0 --> 3017.28
i think what makes super saiyan water is

3014.88 --> 3017.28
where the

3017.359 --> 3024.96
the water is just like

3020.64 --> 3041.839
completely saturated like completely

3024.96 --> 3041.839
and then yeah it gets weird

3045.68 --> 3055.839
don't be ridiculous rocket blimps

3063.04 --> 3069.839
i wonder if they got samples from that

3064.8 --> 3069.8390000000004
extreme that well probably

3071.839 --> 3087.2
shouldn't be difficult

3083.599 --> 3090.96
like i take it that they went beyond

3087.2 --> 3092.72
just guessing right they're not just

3090.96 --> 3095.04
gonna guess like oh that

3092.72 --> 3096.8799999999997
is probably super saline water and then

3095.04 --> 3098.96
not test it whether that's actually

3096.88 --> 3101.2000000000003
super sailing water that seems kind of

3098.96 --> 3103.28
ridiculous

3101.2 --> 3106.48
so i'm pretty sure they would have taken

3103.28 --> 3106.48
a sample and tested it

3109.599 --> 3113.3590000000004
pressure would make a diff well not if

3111.2 --> 3116.24
you got a specific sampler

3113.359 --> 3116.24
if you just got a

3116.64 --> 3121.1189999999997
uh oh

3119.62 --> 3124.7999999999997
[Music]

3121.119 --> 3128.48
call that like a

3124.8 --> 3129.76
is that a syringe no basically a tube

3128.48 --> 3133.44
and just

3129.76 --> 3136.4
stick it in there robot arm control just

3133.44 --> 3137.359
fill it up close it off and then take

3136.4 --> 3140.7200000000003
the sample

3137.359 --> 3144.24
with you back up it's very easy to do

3140.72 --> 3144.24
this sort of thing especially with

3150.839 --> 3153.839
liquids

3165.92 --> 3170.7200000000003
the bridge of the hall i don't know

3174.64 --> 3178.0789999999997
well what about it steli in 80 12. i

3177.359 --> 3180.16
have not

3178.079 --> 3195.8390000000004
noticed anything so i don't know what

3180.16 --> 3195.839
story you're going by now

3231.92 --> 3238.48
the cigar one that they hinted might be

3235.28 --> 3238.48
what are you talking about

3242.0 --> 3251.839

i'm not complaining too much but it's

3445.04 --> 3448.88
just kind of superficial stories

3450.16 --> 3453.5989999999997
super saiyan water

3457.68 --> 3462.64
the meteors flying supposedly past the

3460.319 --> 3462.64
earth

3464.319 --> 3472.24
you don't accept that you find it that

3468.319 --> 3474.64
wow fine i don't

3472.24 --> 3489.839
care you'll find it so freaking

3474.64 --> 3489.839
fascinating it's your problem

3502.16 --> 3508.319
what brian cox says

3506.559 --> 3511.119
humans are holograms where are you

3508.319 --> 3511.119
getting that from

3514.88 --> 3519.92
did he really say that or what he was he

3518.24 --> 3523.1189999999997
just getting theoretical

3519.92 --> 3526.0
precept yeah was he just mind

3523.119 --> 3528.96
experimenting

3526.0 --> 3531.839
did he actually back up why he thought

3528.96 --> 3531.839
that

3536.95 --> 3540.0899999999997
[Music]

3558.319 --> 3564.16
he presupposed it

3561.359 --> 3564.16
well no doubt

3568.96 --> 3576.16
but maybe he just maybe he's trying to

3572.4 --> 3578.64
tackle like interdimensional mechanics

3576.16 --> 3582.48
just saying like oh no the human is just

3578.64 --> 3584.4
the 3d receptacle of a wider thing

3582.48 --> 3587.359
and to the bigger pictures we could be

3584.4 --> 3589.2000000000003
considered like holograms and

3587.359 --> 3590.64
well yeah there's something to argue for

3589.2 --> 3592.96
that

3590.64 --> 3595.2
except though he's a freaking baller and

3592.96 --> 3597.68
then from that perspective it makes no

3595.2 --> 3601.5299999999997
freaking sense it just makes him

3597.68 --> 3604.6789999999996
sound weird potentially solipsistic

3601.53 --> 3604.679
[Music]

3608.319 --> 3612.16
he was saying the universe is not what

3610.559 --> 3614.2400000000002
we think

3612.16 --> 3615.7599999999998
well if he's just speaking for himself

3614.24 --> 3618.8799999999997
and globe believers then he's

3615.76 --> 3618.88
absolutely right

3623.92 --> 3629.839
what is that

3648.72 --> 3654.319
right a creepy [ __ ]

3655.52 --> 3663.599
right so if i think this is what it is

3660.559 --> 3665.2000000000003
if i feel that and what he's trying to

3663.599 --> 3667.839
do is turn things

3665.2 --> 3668.3999999999996
he's basically playing absolute helios

3667.839 --> 3673.44
interest

3668.4 --> 3676.7200000000003
or rather ball reifying satanist

3673.44 --> 3680.0
and he's yeah something i've

3676.72 --> 3680.48
done is basically very much overtly

3680.0 --> 3683.52
state

3680.48 --> 3686.2400000000002
and describe in detail explain

3683.52 --> 3687.7599999999998
how the heavenly bodies are holographic

3686.24 --> 3691.4399999999996
right

3687.76 --> 3694.88
well when you look at freaking satan's

3691.44 --> 3698.16
mental reversed world legacy

3694.88 --> 3700.7200000000003
the stars they are the thing

3698.16 --> 3702.64
either to travel to or to worship or

3700.72 --> 3704.3999999999996
anything and they are physical it

3702.64 --> 3705.2
suggests that they're all physical it's

3704.4 --> 3708.2400000000002
all physical

3705.2 --> 3709.359
right so yeah the next step would be to

3708.24 --> 3711.839
basically then

3709.359 --> 3715.119
once that's established virtually that

3711.839 --> 3717.52
the stars are all physical and real

3715.119 --> 3718.48
and that outer space and all these

3717.52 --> 3727.839
things are

3718.48 --> 3727.839
god [ __ ] off your [ __ ]

3729.599 --> 3741.839
stupid biker i have to do this right in

3733.359 --> 3741.839
front of my

3744.079 --> 3748.079
but it only makes sense that he would

3747.359 --> 3750.16
then

3748.079 --> 3751.119
proceed to basically flip the world

3750.16 --> 3754.3999999999996
around and say

3751.119 --> 3757.52
no the stars are all real

3754.4 --> 3759.039
it's us and the physical world here

3757.52 --> 3762.16
that's the hologram

3759.039 --> 3765.44
right so in that sense

3762.16 --> 3768.0789999999997
yeah it might not be innocent or an

3765.44 --> 3771.92
innocent flukish idea it might simply be

3768.079 --> 3776.0
a very satanic move to

3771.92 --> 3779.359
continue the reversed world process

3776.0 --> 3781.92
by declaring now where the holograms

3779.359 --> 3783.2799999999997
and those lights you see those are the

3781.92 --> 3788.079
physical things

3783.28 --> 3788.079
right doesn't that kind of stand out

3792.799 --> 3799.28
[ __ ] says it's a hologram it

3796.24 --> 3811.839
a hologram says it wow

3799.28 --> 3811.8390000000004
great english there and not specific

3817.359 --> 3821.92
all right so yeah brian cox your [ __ ]

3820.799 --> 3824.96
lunatic

3821.92 --> 3828.559
liar liar scumbag

3824.96 --> 3831.28
yeah we're not holograms

3828.559 --> 3832.7200000000003
we are not holograms we are physical

3831.28 --> 3835.44
receptacles

3832.72 --> 3837.1189999999997
for our spirit spirit given to us by god

3835.44 --> 3839.52
that thing that you deny because you're

3837.119 --> 3843.119
a [ __ ] scumbag

3839.52 --> 3846.559
right or you're too afraid of your

3843.119 --> 3847.6800000000003
peers to recognize it something like

3846.559 --> 3850.3190000000004
that

3847.68 --> 3851.1189999999997
right in those lights you see including

3850.319 --> 3853.52
the sun

3851.119 --> 3854.2400000000002
yeah the sun that bright thing that

3853.52 --> 3857.44
seems to be

3854.24 --> 3858.0789999999997
extremely present and all of the light

3857.44 --> 3860.48
that

3858.079 --> 3861.8390000000004
seems to come from it yeah that is the

3860.48 --> 3866.799
hologram

3861.839 --> 3870.16
we're physically real right

3866.799 --> 3873.119
and so are you or you should

3870.16 --> 3875.839
you shouldn't realize that so maybe you

3873.119 --> 3875.839
should stop

3877.28 --> 3881.599
contributing to people making themselves

3880.559 --> 3885.2000000000003
more insane

3881.599 --> 3885.2000000000003
how about that brian cox

3887.119 --> 3891.6800000000003
right you're not having your supposed

3889.52 --> 3893.92
reversed world david ike moment

3891.68 --> 3895.839
oh it says he saw oh that sounds so

3893.92 --> 3897.52
crazy and then oh you're going to be

3895.839 --> 3900.64
this special boy because

3897.52 --> 3902.799
you came up with that reversed world

3900.64 --> 3908.799
piece of [ __ ] that you're going to

3902.799 --> 3913.2
continue forcing on people

3908.799 --> 3913.2
right with the system let's not do that

3921.599 --> 3925.119
what does that mean amanda you

3927.559 --> 3933.179
c-n-a-h-h-a what does that mean

3930.02 --> 3933.179
[Music]

3933.44 --> 3937.839
anyway thanks for bringing that up

3944.0 --> 3953.92
it could be curved this once

3950.48 --> 3956.96
but it turns out to be completely flat

3953.92 --> 3959.119
wow did he sail that wow

3956.96 --> 3960.88
he might have just gone completely

3959.119 --> 3965.28
insane

3960.88 --> 3967.44
maybe flat earth broke him

3965.28 --> 3979.8390000000004
and he can't replace the mechanisms that

3967.44 --> 3979.839
he had installed

3985.839 --> 3989.68
all right the universe is flat but the

3987.839 --> 3990.0789999999997
earth can be flat the others to be a

3989.68 --> 3995.2
ball

3990.079 --> 3995.2000000000003
in the flat universe all right

3996.4 --> 3999.839
or maybe it's exactly the other way

3999.2 --> 4002.16
around

3999.839 --> 4002.88
the earth is actually flat and the

4002.16 --> 4006.3999999999996
universe

4002.88 --> 4010.4
is a ball a ball

4006.4 --> 4013.6800000000003
surrounding the observer of lights

4010.4 --> 4017.2000000000003
non-local light manifest

4013.68 --> 4019.5989999999997
with holographic signatures

4017.2 --> 4020.48
at the epicenter of the light direction

4019.599 --> 4024.319
with each

4020.48 --> 4026.319
luminary right so again it's exactly

4024.319 --> 4027.92
the other way around this is all

4026.319 --> 4031.119
reversed world

4027.92 --> 4032.559
mind programming [ __ ] they're literally

4031.119 --> 4048.1800000000003
making you fantasize

4032.559 --> 4050.7200000000003
everything inside out when they do that

[Music]

4050.72 --> 4053.5989999999997
hello agm

4059.44 --> 4063.839
how does a hologram emit that type of

4061.44 --> 4063.839
light

4064.48 --> 4069.28
well the hologram is secondary so there

4067.44 --> 4072.4
is definitely

4069.28 --> 4076.1600000000003
light arriving

4072.4 --> 4079.2000000000003
being absorbed being transformed right

4076.16 --> 4079.839
it's just not coming from an object and

4079.2 --> 4083.0389999999998
where we

4079.839 --> 4085.839
presume that the object might be

4083.039 --> 4087.119
based on the observation there is a

4085.839 --> 4091.839
hologram

4087.119 --> 4091.839
a luminary a visible hologram

4092.0 --> 4098.08
at the edge of vision if not obstructed

4095.599 --> 4105.839
by something physical

4098.08 --> 4105.839
before that point

4151.04 --> 4161.839
aide

4152.64 --> 4161.839
oh nice

4188.08 --> 4191.759
who are you talking to among patrol

4192.56 --> 4203.84
who has proof of what

4195.76 --> 4203.84
hey dutch sailor good to see you

4248.32 --> 4255.12
okay well hey by all means don't answer

4252.08 --> 4259.84
just have your proof of that of what i

4255.12 --> 4259.84
don't know

4270.84 --> 4273.84
um

4293.12 --> 4298.48
don't play with your hair it gets amanda

4296.08 --> 4298.48
going

4298.84 --> 4301.84
what

4309.6 --> 4315.84
now i'm just gonna do what i naturally

4312.84 --> 4315.84
do

4326.96 --> 4334.32
can how can a hologram radiate heat

4330.719 --> 4336.64
well a hologram can be made with heat

4334.32 --> 4336.639999999999
even

4337.679 --> 4341.12
that the sun is a hologram well you

4339.76 --> 4343.84
don't have any proof that it's a

4341.12 --> 4343.84
physical object

4343.92 --> 4351.679
it doesn't abide by anything

4347.36 --> 4357.199
that physicality demands

4351.679 --> 4361.28
right can't establish a distance

4357.199 --> 4361.28
any kind of perspective effects

4362.159 --> 4368.08
there's no proximity to prove that it is

4365.679 --> 4369.6
indeed a physical objects that you would

4368.08 --> 4372.32
be approaching

4369.6 --> 4374.2390000000005
like approaching its geometry in

4372.32 --> 4375.5199999999995
euclidean space you have no proof of

4374.239 --> 4379.04
that

4375.52 --> 4382.4800000000005
so since we still see it

4379.04 --> 4385.199
i'm going to go with the next best thing

4382.48 --> 4385.759999999999
concerning phenomena out there and that

4385.199 --> 4390.799999999999
is

4385.76 --> 4390.8
holographic light based a light based

4396.84 --> 4399.84
effect

4401.81 --> 4405.589000000001
[Music]

4410.84 --> 4415.1990000000005
yeah right

4412.88 --> 4416.0
every time i say the sun is like a

4415.199 --> 4420.5599999999995
hologram

4416.0 --> 4423.52
or is holographic i'm not saying like oh

4420.56 --> 4428.159000000001
all that light is all fake it's all just

4423.52 --> 4430.4800000000005
it seems well maybe it is i don't know

4428.159 --> 4432.4
i'm just saying that there is definitely

4430.48 --> 4435.12
light arriving here

4432.4 --> 4436.879999999999
it just doesn't seem to be really coming

4435.12 --> 4440.8
from

4436.88 --> 4444.159000000001
a literal position

4440.8 --> 4448.88
it's more just angular related positions

4444.159 --> 4450.879999999999
seeming seeming locations

4448.88 --> 4452.2390000000005
but when you go there it's not coming

4450.88 --> 4455.84
from there it's

4452.239 --> 4455.839999999999
it's elusive

4458.95 --> 4462.8589999999995
[Music]

4477.84 --> 4481.360000000001
more proof of that no solid proof no

4480.159 --> 4483.92
that's the whole point

4481.36 --> 4485.92
you don't have any hmong patrol you

4483.92 --> 4488.96
don't have any solid proof

4485.92 --> 4491.76
the only thing you got is light arriving

4488.96 --> 4492.4800000000005
and a bunch of angles yeah that's what

4491.76 --> 4495.1990000000005
you got

4492.48 --> 4497.44
light arriving being absorbed and a

4495.199 --> 4501.919999999999
bunch of angles to celestial bodies

4497.44 --> 4504.639999999999
that is the only thing you have

4501.92 --> 4507.28
all right let's get real here that's the

4504.64 --> 4510.320000000001
only thing you got

4507.28 --> 4510.88
you have no proof the sun is a ball of

4510.32 --> 4525.84
fire

4510.88 --> 4525.84
anywhere none none whatsoever

4529.04 --> 4537.12
okay john james

4533.28 --> 4541.199
so your uncle went there five years ago

4537.12 --> 4541.199
cool that's nice

4542.56 --> 4546.64
how people actually go around antarctica

4545.12 --> 4549.36
by boat i don't know

4546.64 --> 4550.2390000000005
i've never tried it there's said to be

4549.36 --> 4553.679
this arc

4550.239 --> 4557.199
antarctic race

4553.679 --> 4559.76
but even from maps

4557.199 --> 4561.759999999999
like map displays of the route it's kind

4559.76 --> 4565.04
of been suggested that they kind of like

4561.76 --> 4568.8
go one way and then go back again

4565.04 --> 4572.719
so they don't actually continue on in a

4568.8 --> 4576.08
well in a straight line or in a circle

4572.719 --> 4580.56
they literally go back and forth

4576.08 --> 4583.12
that's already kind of suspect

4580.56 --> 4583.120000000001
right guys

4588.8 --> 4595.84
does a hologram not need a projector oh

4591.199 --> 4595.839999999999
you sure it does

4629.84 --> 4635.76
it needs something to project well look

4633.199 --> 4638.239
it's manifesting now how it is

4635.76 --> 4640.0
manifesting i'm not entirely sure but

4638.239 --> 4643.36
there is definitely energy

4640.0 --> 4644.8
and energy transfer involved it's no

4643.36 --> 4647.44
doubt about it

4644.8 --> 4647.4400000000005
has to be

4649.36 --> 4653.5199999999995
now how that mechanism works i don't

4651.76 --> 4657.92
know exactly i have

4653.52 --> 4657.92
vague suspicious suspicions

4658.4 --> 4663.199
suggested things and models but without

4661.199 --> 4667.678999999999
any

4663.199 --> 4671.04
tie-in system that could

4667.679 --> 4672.96
make me engage in some kind of micro

4671.04 --> 4674.88
experiment to try and test if i could

4672.96 --> 4677.28
simulate it on a small scale

4674.88 --> 4680.32
or anything so it's it's nothing

4677.28 --> 4680.32
concrete just yet

4682.48 --> 4687.678999999999
but yeah in the meantime all evidence

4685.52 --> 4693.84
of a physical nature of these heavenly

4687.679 --> 4693.84
bodies is completely elusive

4701.84 --> 4705.4400000000005
how far is the way is the sun there is

4704.08 --> 4708.32
no distance to the sun

4705.44 --> 4710.32
started in 80 12 it's not a physical

4708.32 --> 4712.88
object in euclidean space to have a

4710.32 --> 4715.5199999999995
distance towards

4712.88 --> 4718.159000000001
it's a hologram it only has apparent

4715.52 --> 4718.159000000001
distances

4718.64 --> 4722.08
depending on the observer's

4732.84 --> 4736.88
interpretation

4735.12 --> 4739.76
how does that work on a flat earth oh

4736.88 --> 4739.76
it's very simple

4740.96 --> 4746.159
it's there the light is there it is

4743.12 --> 4750.4
manifesting in that distinct pattern

4746.159 --> 4753.28
and that's what it is and it works

4750.4 --> 4755.759999999999
yeah we are not making any geometrical

4753.28 --> 4760.719
presumptions

4755.76 --> 4764.320000000001
about any part of it including the earth

4760.719 --> 4766.32
based on the heavenly sightings

4764.32 --> 4767.599999999999
the heavenly sightings the globe of the

4766.32 --> 4770.48
heavens

4767.6 --> 4771.679
is arranged including daylight night

4770.48 --> 4774.159
cycles

4771.679 --> 4775.84
the way it is and it has a very distinct

4774.159 --> 4778.799999999999
pattern in relation to the

4775.84 --> 4781.360000000001
the known earth surface that's the data

4778.8 --> 4781.360000000001
we have

4783.679 --> 4787.679
in the meantime by the way there's no

4785.199 --> 4791.44
curvature and yeah the horizon is not

4787.679 --> 4794.64
a sphere edge right it's not actually

4791.44 --> 4797.5199999999995
concealing things behind it which the

4794.64 --> 4799.84
geometry would demand

4797.52 --> 4800.88
so yeah the earth is flat and we don't

4799.84 --> 4803.360000000001
give a [ __ ]

4800.88 --> 4804.88
how the heavenly bodies are supposed to

4803.36 --> 4806.48
work on a flat earth

4804.88 --> 4808.719
because it's flat and you have no

4806.48 --> 4810.0
evidence that it's anything other than

4808.719 --> 4811.84
flat

4810.0 --> 4813.679
and then what are the heavenly bodies

4811.84 --> 4816.4800000000005
yeah it's a mystery

4813.679 --> 4819.04
it's called a mystery it's called

4816.48 --> 4822.159
getting on with it and

4819.04 --> 4826.88
trying to figure it out instead of

4822.159 --> 4826.879999999999
bugging yourself down with disproven

4830.84 --> 4833.84
illusions

4840.45 --> 4843.97
[Music]

4844.84 --> 4847.84
so

4854.88 --> 4858.8
yeah james mason vitamin d very

4858.84 --> 4864.159000000001
important

4860.96 --> 4864.159
especially in the winter

4869.6 --> 4878.2390000000005
all right well dutch sailor

4875.6 --> 4880.719
if it is such a bad thing in in your

4878.239 --> 4883.04
mind to say i don't know

4880.719 --> 4883.92
as some kind of a final statement then

4883.04 --> 4887.5199999999995
you could just say

4883.92 --> 4889.76
i don't know yet

4887.52 --> 4891.280000000001
because i can't exclude that i might

4889.76 --> 4894.159000000001
find out one day

4891.28 --> 4896.4
right as long as you're being honest

4894.159 --> 4903.839999999999
about your findings

4896.4 --> 4903.839999999999
but the data that the entirety of it

4911.52 --> 4917.679
right rocket blimp and vitamin k2 on top

4914.56 --> 4931.84
of that with vitamin d that's correct

4917.679 --> 4931.84
it helps it being absorbed better

4933.6 --> 4939.04
wow john james that's that's really sad

4942.84 --> 4945.84
buddy

4956.84 --> 4959.84
huh

4988.05 --> 4995.92
[Music]

4992.56 --> 4999.280000000001
proper evidences facts

4995.92 --> 5000.8
etc flat earthers nothing at all except

4999.28 --> 5003.84
we do

5000.8 --> 5004.76
yeah we got all the data too except we

5003.84 --> 5007.679
don't have any

5004.76 --> 5011.1990000000005
presuppositions

5007.679 --> 5014.2390000000005
that might basically

5011.199 --> 5017.5199999999995
conceal to us that certain types of data

5014.239 --> 5019.5199999999995
are impossible to gather

5017.52 --> 5020.8
must have been faked and that there is

5019.52 --> 5024.0
fakery going on

5020.8 --> 5026.719
yes there is faking going on especially

5024.0 --> 5029.44
in globe world a lot of it

5026.719 --> 5031.36
like the supposed meteors coming past us

5029.44 --> 5034.96
every few months

5031.36 --> 5038.159
it's complete [ __ ] but it fits

5034.96 --> 5040.96
the cosmological thinking and people

5038.159 --> 5045.04
want to fantasize about that [ __ ]

5040.96 --> 5049.12
apparently right

5045.04 --> 5053.12
if you know what's going on then you

5049.12 --> 5053.12
know that that's just complete [ __ ]

5054.96 --> 5059.28
and nothing ever happens ever it never

5058.239 --> 5062.48
happens

5059.28 --> 5063.04
it never happens it never happens yeah

5062.48 --> 5066.48
you can

5063.04 --> 5069.6
literally hear like 10

5066.48 --> 5070.959999999999
000 stories over your lifetime about how

5069.6 --> 5074.639
a meteor flew by

5070.96 --> 5078.8
almost hit us yeah it's never happened

5074.639 --> 5082.400000000001
ever right it only exists in this super

5078.8 --> 5085.679
far past sci-fi tales about ancient

5082.4 --> 5086.5599999999995
earth ball that's the only place that's

5085.679 --> 5099.84
ever happened

5086.56 --> 5099.84
because it's never happened

5105.36 --> 5108.719
how can we go all around antarctica by

5108.239 --> 5112.0
boat

5108.719 --> 5116.0
owner flat earth what well you

5112.0 --> 5116.0
can go past the ice wall

5116.48 --> 5120.159
and then there's all kinds of ways you

5118.239 --> 5123.199
could end up it all depends on the

5120.159 --> 5125.12
orientation of your gyroscope

5123.199 --> 5127.5199999999995
within the boat that you're going gonna

5125.12 --> 5130.239
do it with and if you keep track of its

5127.52 --> 5132.0
orientation how many total degrees it

5130.239 --> 5134.48
adds up retracts

5132.0 --> 5136.8
in the entire journey right because yeah

5134.48 --> 5140.638999999999
dude who knows

5136.8 --> 5140.96
on the flat earth in reality antarctica

5140.639 --> 5143.679
may

5140.96 --> 5144.719
turn out to be a like an ice circle

5143.679 --> 5146.4800000000005
seemingly

5144.719 --> 5148.719
surrounding the realm even though it

5146.48 --> 5151.12
might be smaller than could actually fit

5148.719 --> 5153.36
something really weird like that

5151.12 --> 5154.8
or it may turn out that it's not a

5153.36 --> 5156.239
circle at all

5154.8 --> 5157.92
you're just going to go in a straight

5156.239 --> 5159.199
line and then end up in the same

5157.92 --> 5162.56
location

5159.199 --> 5162.5599999999995
not having turned any

5162.639 --> 5167.52
adding up because you're going to turn

5164.239 --> 5169.678999999999
and turn back to basically match the

5167.52 --> 5172.88
contours of the

5169.679 --> 5174.32
landmass and the ice

5172.88 --> 5177.6
but yeah it might turn out you're just

5174.32 --> 5177.599999999999
gonna go in a straight line

5177.76 --> 5182.639
or maybe it is a freaking island maybe

5180.719 --> 5185.679
you will go

5182.639 --> 5188.56
basically 360 degrees

5185.679 --> 5191.4400000000005
around it and it turns out that it is

5188.56 --> 5191.4400000000005
like an island

5191.76 --> 5197.76
that you're always looking at the

5195.44 --> 5199.44
like the outer perimeter of a circle as

5197.76 --> 5202.08
it were

5199.44 --> 5203.5199999999995
instead of looking on the inside of a

5202.08 --> 5206.08
circle

5203.52 --> 5206.88
who knows but the fact remains it's all

5206.08 --> 5209.28
flat

5206.88 --> 5210.0
and that makes things weird that's right

5209.28 --> 5212.88
it makes things

5210.0 --> 5214.56
weird still flat though it's not a

5212.88 --> 5217.92
freaking ball no matter what

5214.56 --> 5220.2390000000005
no matter what it's never going to be

5217.92 --> 5221.52
a literal geometrical ball the earth

5220.239 --> 5223.599999999999
will never

5221.52 --> 5226.0
turn out to be a literal geometrical

5223.6 --> 5229.04
ball no matter what

5226.0 --> 5232.639
it will always be a lie it will never

5229.04 --> 5236.88
be true physical earth world

5232.639 --> 5241.36
realm is not a ball

5236.88 --> 5241.36
right might be pretty surreal place

5242.639 --> 5246.400000000001
but it's flat and it's never a

5245.199 --> 5248.719
geometrical

5246.4 --> 5250.799999999999
literal ball it's never going to turn

5248.719 --> 5253.84
out to be that way

5250.8 --> 5253.84
get over it

5266.71 --> 5269.85
[Music]

5280.08 --> 5283.92
what is the name of the song miss crazy

5283.44 --> 5285.759999999999
well

5283.92 --> 5288.4
it doesn't really have a name it's the

5285.76 --> 5291.679
early bird show intro

5288.4 --> 5291.679
and chris barry made it

5291.92 --> 5309.84
it's pretty cool isn't it i'm very happy

5293.92 --> 5309.84
with my intro song

5321.679 --> 5327.36
god no no none of it does

5324.88 --> 5328.400000000001
none of it does i'm sorry the earth is

5327.36 --> 5330.5599999999995
flat

5328.4 --> 5331.92
it's flat it doesn't matter what kind of

5330.56 --> 5334.96
sightings you have

5331.92 --> 5337.36
it's flat it's all flat doesn't matter

5334.96 --> 5339.6
all the celestial sky clock phenomena

5337.36 --> 5342.719
and the seeming eclipses

5339.6 --> 5343.04
and the supposed moon shadow and all

5342.719 --> 5345.199
that

5343.04 --> 5347.12
and oh it's lovely how that works out

5345.199 --> 5350.0
geometrically doesn't it

5347.12 --> 5351.92
within the virtual geometric realm

5350.0 --> 5355.04
created

5351.92 --> 5356.4
on top of the heavenly sphere sightings

5355.04 --> 5358.239
which is what they are they're just

5356.4 --> 5359.599999999999
at the edge of vision it's like a sphere

5358.239 --> 5361.199
it's a celestial sphere

5359.6 --> 5363.4400000000005
all the luminaries together form a

5361.199 --> 5365.28
celestial sphere it's just a sphere

5363.44 --> 5368.0
surrounding the edge of vision

5365.28 --> 5369.759999999999
for every observer there's an inherent

5368.0 --> 5372.639
part to cite

5369.76 --> 5373.76
but yet all the geometrical things

5372.639 --> 5375.4400000000005
puzzled out

5373.76 --> 5378.400000000001
with all the luminaries and the

5375.44 --> 5380.4
wandering stars the planets and all that

5378.4 --> 5381.44
yeah i know the geometry is so

5380.4 --> 5385.04
suggestive

5381.44 --> 5388.638999999999
right it's not that though

5385.04 --> 5391.199
because all of that requires

5388.639 --> 5392.0
physical nature physical approach it

5391.199 --> 5396.0
requires some

5392.0 --> 5399.04
kind of cohesive conception

5396.0 --> 5401.28
of forces keeping all this physical

5399.04 --> 5401.679
stuff presumed to be physical stuff out

5401.28 --> 5404.719
there

5401.679 --> 5406.32
in place right

5404.719 --> 5408.159
remember that oh yeah gravity is

5406.32 --> 5411.04
supposed to do that remember

5408.159 --> 5412.638999999999
when gravity was still officially

5411.04 --> 5415.679
presumed to be a force even though

5412.639 --> 5417.92
nobody claimed the hypothesis for it

5415.679 --> 5419.679
right and then einstein brought it out

5417.92 --> 5422.4800000000005
of whack even more

5419.679 --> 5425.04
but he did that because if they just

5422.48 --> 5426.959999999999
stuck to neutodian gravity

5425.04 --> 5428.48
and really latched on to that and

5426.96 --> 5430.4800000000005
permanently done that

5428.48 --> 5432.839999999999
then its flaws would have made the

5430.48 --> 5435.44
entire thing explode

5432.84 --> 5439.28
because as of

5435.44 --> 5442.4
a long time ago was figured out that

5439.28 --> 5445.599999999999
if you put all these orbital mechanics

5442.4 --> 5448.4
the idea of the heliocentric

5445.6 --> 5450.56
solar system our solar system right

5448.4 --> 5453.92
wandering stars surrounding us

5450.56 --> 5457.360000000001
directly in the presupposed heliocentric

5453.92 --> 5461.6
system in that

5457.36 --> 5464.4
format mercury cannot be calculated

5461.6 --> 5464.88
to work out with gravity they can't do

5464.4 --> 5466.96
it

5464.88 --> 5468.8
they could never do it they have never

5466.96 --> 5471.12
been able to model it

5468.8 --> 5471.84
they always would have to leave mercury

5471.12 --> 5473.36
out

5471.84 --> 5475.04
and then things would be alright it

5473.36 --> 5475.679
would kind of work with the gravity

5475.04 --> 5478.96
ideas

5475.679 --> 5481.28
of newtonian mechanics which he never

5478.96 --> 5482.8
claimed hypothesis for by the way

5481.28 --> 5484.32
right it would always work out but they

5482.8 --> 5488.08
could never get

5484.32 --> 5492.08
mercury to work out so what did they do

5488.08 --> 5494.96
they just did not complete the model

5492.08 --> 5496.5599999999995
literally calculated it all with

5494.96 --> 5499.6
newtonian gravity

5496.56 --> 5502.56
and then basically painted over

5499.6 --> 5504.400000000001
mercury drawing a circle in the geometry

5502.56 --> 5505.52
it's supposed to be going without being

5504.4 --> 5508.0
subjected tumor

5505.52 --> 5510.0
to gravity in the entire model so it

5508.0 --> 5513.6
technically doesn't exist

5510.0 --> 5516.96
right mercury physically doesn't exist

5513.6 --> 5518.719
within the model that that has

5516.96 --> 5520.88
like the whole gravity thing going in

5518.719 --> 5523.84
order to explain how it's all moving

5520.88 --> 5524.400000000001
in in the system in the solar system all

5523.84 --> 5528.159000000001
right

5524.4 --> 5530.4
so they left it out and then said

5528.159 --> 5532.4
well because we can't calculate it with

5530.4 --> 5535.44
newtonian graphic

5532.4 --> 5537.599999999999
yeah gravity and make it work out we're

5535.44 --> 5538.159
just gonna say it's time space bending

5537.6 --> 5542.0
and we don't

5538.159 --> 5545.759999999999
understand and at that

5542.0 --> 5548.8
can technically calculate it because

5545.76 --> 5550.88
einstein in gravity the math behind it's

5548.8 --> 5551.92
not even real physics anymore the math

5550.88 --> 5554.32
behind it

5551.92 --> 5555.28
it doesn't allow you to actually

5554.32 --> 5559.12
completely

5555.28 --> 5559.759999999999
calculate the entire heliocentric solar

5559.12 --> 5563.28
system

5559.76 --> 5566.159000000001
of ours can't do that because

5563.28 --> 5568.239
it can only calculate one attractive

5566.159 --> 5571.5199999999995
body at a time so you could never build

5568.239 --> 5574.718999999999
a complete model like they could

5571.52 --> 5577.120000000001
with newtonian gravity except for that

5574.719 --> 5580.2390000000005
they couldn't make mercury work

5577.12 --> 5581.04
so this is kind of like the design this

5580.239 --> 5584.879999999999
is god's

5581.04 --> 5588.8
revenge like no you can't

5584.88 --> 5589.92
complete this lie you can't do it it's

5588.8 --> 5592.0
impossible

5589.92 --> 5593.4400000000005
like even in the virtual realm it's

5592.0 --> 5595.6
impossible

5593.44 --> 5596.5599999999995
you can never make this real it will

5595.6 --> 5600.159000000001
always be

5596.56 --> 5603.4400000000005
visible to be a lie as per decree

5600.159 --> 5606.32
within the fine grain

5603.44 --> 5609.12
of the design itself it was always going

5606.32 --> 5609.12
to be that way

5609.52 --> 5612.320000000001
you understand

5612.639 --> 5616.32
it doesn't work the heliocentric model

5615.52 --> 5619.52
doesn't work

5616.32 --> 5620.239
it works in nothing everything about it

5619.52 --> 5623.52
is broken

5620.239 --> 5625.44
every concept ever devised that

5623.52 --> 5628.400000000001
every all the people all the believers

5625.44 --> 5631.199
rest on all of it is broken

5628.4 --> 5632.48
and they in they gaslight us the ones

5631.199 --> 5634.48
pointing it out

5632.48 --> 5636.799999999999
like everything we do is broken and

5634.48 --> 5640.08
they're all fixed but when you point at

5636.8 --> 5642.4800000000005
what is broken they know

5640.08 --> 5644.08
they know they're lying to themselves in

5642.48 --> 5646.159
those moments

5644.08 --> 5648.5599999999995
it's just kind of annoying to realize

5646.159 --> 5649.92
that it's nicer to fantasize that you're

5648.56 --> 5654.8
on the right side when you're

5649.92 --> 5654.8
absolutely 180 degrees on the wrong side

5656.88 --> 5660.400000000001
because everything about the

5658.48 --> 5663.839999999999
heliocentric model is broken

5660.4 --> 5665.44
everything it's not one bit about it

5663.84 --> 5669.08
that actually works

5665.44 --> 5672.48
only geometric paths and

5669.08 --> 5674.159
separated geometrical elements

5672.48 --> 5676.08
that's the only thing that can work

5674.159 --> 5676.719
about it because as soon as you actually

5676.08 --> 5680.32
try to

5676.719 --> 5683.92
reify it into physical systems

5680.32 --> 5685.759999999999
it all breaks up on every corner

5683.92 --> 5687.679
every corner it breaks up there is

5685.76 --> 5690.88
nothing about it that works

5687.679 --> 5691.6
it can never be made to work it can

5690.88 --> 5695.4400000000005
never

5691.6 --> 5698.639
be made to work it's impossible

5695.44 --> 5702.48
because god and the design he provided

5698.639 --> 5706.159000000001
does not allow that in reality

5702.48 --> 5709.678999999999
you can never make it work it can't

5706.159 --> 5713.04
work can only work

5709.679 --> 5716.159
in the realm of satan where it is okay

5713.04 --> 5719.6
to overlook details where it is okay to

5716.159 --> 5722.638999999999
lie that's the only place it can work

5719.6 --> 5725.76
in your imagination where shortcomings

5722.639 --> 5727.52
can easily be overlooked

5725.76 --> 5729.84
the only way to make it work is to

5727.52 --> 5729.84
embrace

lying scumbag

5775.6 --> 5782.159000000001
earth is flat it's not a ball

5779.36 --> 5782.96
heliocentric universe in outer space is

5782.159 --> 5787.36
a lie

5782.96 --> 5789.679
you have no physical proof of any of it

5787.36 --> 5791.28
you're just lying to yourself i don't

5789.679 --> 5794.88
give a [ __ ]

5791.28 --> 5798.159
you can't guess like me right

5794.88 --> 5800.4800000000005
i know what i'm talking about i have the

5798.159 --> 5813.839999999999
evidence

5800.48 --> 5813.839999999999
structural evidence

5819.44 --> 5821.678999999999
see

5823.92 --> 5827.84
hey dank good to see you

5828.639 --> 5841.84
yeah we heard

5850.56 --> 5855.6900000000005
oh okay the extremely

5854.88 --> 5858.639
what the hell

[Music]

5858.639 --> 5860.88
no

5866.0 --> 5870.239
no alan mcdonald earth is not flat as a

5869.52 --> 5874.0
pancake

5870.239 --> 5878.638999999999
we don't know what what the surface is

5874.0 --> 5878.639
like but it is flat though

5880.159 --> 5883.839999999999
hello jadoo

5899.679 --> 5901.92
right

5906.96 --> 5911.679
right rare but not possible

5910.5 --> 5914.08
[Music]

5911.679 --> 5916.08
that's a good one yeah it's like oh it's

5914.08 --> 5918.239
very rare it's still a black swan though

5916.08 --> 5918.719
you know you only need one oh it's very

5918.239 --> 5921.5199999999995
rare

5918.719 --> 5923.52
well one proof there's not just white

5921.52 --> 5926.639
swan so it's over

5923.52 --> 5930.0
right so again flexibility of mind

5926.639 --> 5932.08
it's okay if things don't make sense on

5930.0 --> 5935.28
the heliocentric model

5932.08 --> 5938.08
see see what you're doing it's okay

5935.28 --> 5940.5599999999995
if it doesn't make any sense it's still

5938.08 --> 5944.4
what we think what i think it is

5940.56 --> 5946.88
because i choose to ignore the things

5944.4 --> 5947.759999999999
that make it absolutely impossible every

5946.88 --> 5950.2390000000005
step of the way

5947.76 --> 5950.96
so that's a continual process then

5950.239 --> 5952.879999999999
that's

5950.96 --> 5954.639
something you're going to be continually

5952.88 --> 5956.08
doing every time

5954.639 --> 5957.76
because you're going to face a lot of

5956.08 --> 5961.76
those types of things like

5957.76 --> 5964.639
oh it's so rare this is the excuse

5961.76 --> 5965.1990000000005
no it can work because i decide to

5964.639 --> 5967.76
believe

5965.199 --> 5970.0
it can work even though the facts point

5967.76 --> 5971.679
out it can

5970.0 --> 5973.84
because you don't want to think about it

5971.679 --> 5977.1990000000005
logically you just

5973.84 --> 5982.08
want to move past and get back to the

5977.199 --> 5984.32
imagery imagination

5982.08 --> 5988.159
right because there it works in your

5984.32 --> 5988.159
imagination nobody's gonna whine

5988.32 --> 5992.88
about you're not supposed to believe

5990.719 --> 5996.96
that because it's wrong

5992.88 --> 5996.96
your imagination everything's just fine

6002.639 --> 6009.84

well that's very nice monk patrol how

6174.84 --> 6178.96
special

6177.199 --> 6182.4
doesn't explain anything about the

6178.96 --> 6182.4
heliocentric model though

6183.119 --> 6187.599999999999
because eclipses still don't make any

6185.36 --> 6191.04
sense

6187.6 --> 6194.159000000001
like how could the moon

6191.04 --> 6196.08
literally do that in front of the sun

6194.159 --> 6198.239
and then leave such a small shadow that

6196.08 --> 6199.92
makes no sense and i'm not gonna go into

6198.239 --> 6204.959999999999
the intricacies of it

6199.92 --> 6219.84
did i make and no it makes no sense now

that's the only [ __ ] thing they'll

6527.28 --> 6530.159
you don't like that

6531.28 --> 6534.8
i'm not gonna take the ads away though

6533.76 --> 6538.08
what i don't

6534.8 --> 6541.76
at least you gotta thank me like back

6538.08 --> 6544.159
at the like first 200 episodes of the

6541.76 --> 6545.84
early bird show i set the advertisement

6544.159 --> 6548.879999999999
like every 20 minutes

6545.84 --> 6552.400000000001
i don't do that anymore and no george

6548.88 --> 6555.599
sanford don't use adblocker

6552.4 --> 6559.759999999999
don't don't do that

6555.599 --> 6564.88
please don't right it's part of my setup

6559.76 --> 6564.88
i need it for my stats

6566.48 --> 6570.718999999999
right i don't have ads you can't skip

6570.96 --> 6574.719
i specifically arrange that because

6572.96 --> 6576.2390000000005
those really suck when you have to wait

6574.719 --> 6578.56
like 20 seconds on some

garbage or some alcohol advertising

6578.56 --> 6582.320000000001
[ __ ]

6580.32 --> 6585.759999999999
those typically can't be clicked away

6582.32 --> 6585.759999999999
from it's very annoying

6586.239 --> 6592.48
right always have skippable ads

6590.32 --> 6593.84
please don't use adblocker and i'm sorry

6592.48 --> 6597.598999999999
if you don't like it yeah

6593.84 --> 6601.84
i didn't make those advertisements okay

6597.599 --> 6605.1990000000005
but if i'm i'm glad to even get

6601.84 --> 6608.400000000001
the opportunity to have ads placed here

6605.199 --> 6610.799999999999
on my show because then yeah

6608.4 --> 6612.4
at least i i can have some indirect

6610.8 --> 6616.2390000000005
income from it

6612.4 --> 6617.36
and maybe expand that if if i were to

6616.239 --> 6620.48
transcend this

6617.36 --> 6620.799999999999
financial situation at some point then

6620.48 --> 6625.839999999999
it's

6620.8 --> 6625.84
gonna be even extra helpful

6634.88 --> 6639.36
right and ads do typically also happen

6637.679 --> 6641.36
when you refresh the page this is

6639.36 --> 6653.839999999999
something i noticed myself because i

6641.36 --> 6653.839999999999
also get those ads

6668.8 --> 6680.08
right so yeah i'm gonna be rounding out

6672.32 --> 6682.639
the show soon

6680.08 --> 6686.08
it's been kind of a calm hangout i think

6682.639 --> 6686.08
it's been kind of nice and calm

6686.88 --> 6693.1990000000005
like all that raging stuff

6690.08 --> 6694.8
i guess people appreciate it if somebody

6693.199 --> 6696.719
expresses that

6694.8 --> 6698.96
kind of like so they don't have to as

6696.719 --> 6700.96
much they at least have a feeling like

6698.96 --> 6703.28
okay i'm not crazy

6700.96 --> 6709.84
other people feel like this too but it's

6703.28 --> 6709.84
just not very good for myself

6729.599 --> 6731.92
what

6735.52 --> 6738.96
where are you getting that from shaking

6737.199 --> 6751.839999999999
still water that's

6738.96 --> 6751.84
what are you talking about

6772.159 --> 6776.638999999999
you got a citation for that seeking

6774.0 --> 6776.639
style water

6777.679 --> 6793.84
where is that officially accepted

6818.84 --> 6821.84
what

6824.639 --> 6828.639
but seeking star wars could you at least

6826.32 --> 6829.44
say where you got it from because now it

6828.639 --> 6832.08
kind of sounds

6829.44 --> 6834.0
kind of like random blurring out i mean

6832.08 --> 6837.599
there's a lot of sixes

6834.0 --> 6840.159
in the numbers

6837.599 --> 6841.119000000001
right of the model numbers the geometry

6840.159 --> 6844.5599999999995

6841.119 --> 6844.5599999999995

666 000 miles per hour where are you

6858.48 --> 6863.04
getting it from

6863.04 --> 6868.159
this [ __ ]

6864.0 --> 6870.4
for them okay not saying that you did

6868.159 --> 6871.28
but it is kind of like if you're gonna

6870.4 --> 6873.679
bring that up

6871.28 --> 6877.84

6873.679 --> 6877.84
