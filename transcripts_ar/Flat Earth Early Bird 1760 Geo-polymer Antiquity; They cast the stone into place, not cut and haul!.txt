I can really use

102.36 --> 111.2
it so please somebody donate

107.56 --> 113.07900000000001
something starting to wonder if it still

111.2 --> 116.479
works

113.079 --> 118.83999999999999
anyway weather today it's a little

116.479 --> 120.439
better than yesterday it's

118.84 --> 122.60000000000001
not

120.439 --> 125.32
all gray soup it's there's a patch of

122.6 --> 127.399
Blue Sky up there woohoo had a bit of

125.32 --> 131.599
sun

127.399 --> 135.56
earlier but uh yeah it's still mostly

131.599 --> 135.56
clouded beside that

139.319 --> 144.67999999999998
patch right does seem like there's

142.76 --> 148.319
barely any wind today

144.68 --> 148.31900000000002
though it's a big

148.519 --> 153.59900000000002
difference it's like kind of

150.959 --> 157.72
still it's

153.599 --> 157.72
nice makes it a little less

167.599 --> 170.879
cold all

175.84 --> 184.56
right

178.319 --> 184.56
so it is Thursday the 26th of October

191.0 --> 195.72
2023 temperature is 11°

201.08 --> 207.239
C all right the weird thing is it's kind

204.84 --> 208.799
of the roughly the same temperature at

207.239 --> 210.68
night it's not like it's really cooling

208.799 --> 213.20000000000002
down at night or

210.68 --> 216.36
anything it's like according to this

213.2 --> 219.48
it's like 8 9

216.36 --> 225.59900000000002
11 at

219.48 --> 225.599
night it's not very warm during the day

226.12 --> 232.04
though 12 13

230.4 --> 234.84
14

232.04 --> 238.67999999999998
right hey fiber outs first in chat good

234.84 --> 241.68
to see you how you

238.68 --> 241.68
doing

255.04 --> 260.59999999999997
all right there's no fed again

257.359 --> 263.08
today I doubt there will be

260.6 --> 268.08000000000004
tomorrow this might take a long time for

263.08 --> 268.08
Nathan to recover his computer

268.36 --> 273.6
again I really hope he figures it

281.36 --> 286.639
out I mean it's just like with medicine

284.199 --> 287.639
when you're when you've tinkered that

286.639 --> 291.52
much

287.639 --> 294.28000000000003
eventually you'll just be handed over to

291.52 --> 296.75899999999996
alop allopathic

294.28 --> 301.55999999999995
Solutions even computer-wise because

296.759 --> 301.56
it's like it's messed around too much

303.759 --> 309.88
like there's just a great likelihood

306.44 --> 311.52
that the stuff he's using now is like

309.88 --> 314.479
because it's all assembled is not

311.52 --> 314.479
actually all that

316.32 --> 320.12
compatible can't be sure

321.52 --> 327.0
though cuz sometimes when you assemble

324.4 --> 328.75899999999996
certain parts in a computer it just

327.0 --> 330.44
doesn't work even though it's supposed

328.759 --> 332.16
to

330.44 --> 335.4
cuz it's

332.16 --> 337.68
like they they can't get along together

335.4 --> 337.67999999999995
it's

337.88 --> 345.0
weird that's why you got to rely on

341.24 --> 348.6
trusted tested Assemblies of specific

345.0 --> 350.16
setups that always work together that's

348.6 --> 352.88
really how you got to assemble your

350.16 --> 354.52000000000004
computer if you go any other direction

352.88 --> 358.15999999999997
it's always going to be

354.52 --> 360.88
like uh Patchwork and then eventually it

358.16 --> 363.16
will turn to that chaos us that you

360.88 --> 363.15999999999997
don't

365.0 --> 368.0
want

374.199 --> 379.84000000000003
anyway right as for me f outs yeah I'm

388.4 --> 391.4
okay

396.4 --> 401.71999999999997
I'm a bit weird

397.72 --> 404.72
today cuz yesterday like I had a

401.72 --> 407.56
beer that I had like stored I don't know

404.72 --> 409.639
I had that bought a while ago for some

407.56 --> 411.52
kind of Celebration idea but that never

409.639 --> 414.599
really came and yesterday I was

411.52 --> 416.44
like I'm done staring at that beer I'm

414.599 --> 420.479
going to take it which is like a sign on

416.44 --> 424.71999999999997
the wall like yeah like I can't have

420.479 --> 426.8
alcohol storage or or well beer I mean

424.72 --> 429.84000000000003
rougher alcohol that would probably be

426.8 --> 432.479
fine just sitting there but I mean it's

429.84 --> 432.479
going to call

432.52 --> 439.71999999999997
me right and I don't really feel bad

436.8 --> 441.599
from it it's yeah I barely felt anything

439.72 --> 446.28000000000003
even drinking

441.599 --> 446.28
it but uh Hey Mojo good to see

448.319 --> 451.319
you

458.5 --> 461.66
[Music]

462.24 --> 467.24
uh

464.879 --> 468.759
right yeah everything else pretty much

467.24 --> 471.84000000000003
fine I mean it didn't have like a

468.759 --> 471.84000000000003
massive impact or

471.919 --> 476.56
anything just a little I was very

475.12 --> 479.8
worried it was going to have a big

476.56 --> 482.4
impact it didn't really but I do feel

479.8 --> 486.08
like wow if I had two bears now then I

482.4 --> 486.08
would definitely feel [ __ ] right

487.72 --> 491.96000000000004
now right so I'm glad that I

499.479 --> 504.56
didn't I think that it's like much

501.72 --> 507.40000000000003
better when it's just warm anyway hey

504.56 --> 509.84
clutch good to see you the late bird

507.4 --> 512.519
show yeah that's don't worry about it

509.84 --> 514.56
it's true but I mean there's no flat

512.519 --> 517.519
Earth debate so I'm like why am I going

514.56 --> 520.68
to start that early when I'm mostly

517.519 --> 524.2
going to be like kind of tired

520.68 --> 526.88
anyway I mean I really have to admit

524.2 --> 529.44
that on average my Early Bird shows they

526.88 --> 531.2
can be great but usually the first half

529.44 --> 534.2
hour I'm just kind of

531.2 --> 537.0400000000001
slow it's just the way it is and it's

534.2 --> 540.279
also because well you guys are often a

537.04 --> 544.36
bit slow which I totally expect because

540.279 --> 544.36
well it's very early for

545.04 --> 548.04
you

550.72 --> 557.2
right so now I'm just starting a bit

553.92 --> 561.12
later because I

557.2 --> 561.12
can and I can just go

568.12 --> 571.12
on

574.88 --> 582.399
right by the way I do have my

578.959 --> 588.04
last I have to get new ones after

582.399 --> 588.04
this right over here looking forward to

598.12 --> 601.12
that

602.44 --> 609.0400000000001
uh yeah um home Benjamin was very

606.8 --> 612.279
interesting he had

609.04 --> 614.24
the I for always forget his name but the

612.279 --> 616.48
gun guy from

614.24 --> 621.0
vertech on

616.48 --> 623.5600000000001
again very interesting guy like what he

621.0 --> 623.56
just has

623.64 --> 629.88
this the stability to him that's just

627.48 --> 632.47
amazing right

629.88 --> 634.399
uh that was

632.47 --> 637.33
[Music]

634.399 --> 640.04
there trying to think of

637.33 --> 643.399
[Music]

640.04 --> 646.16
subjects very glad yesterday to roll out

643.399 --> 649.76
basically the well one model it was a

646.16 --> 652.279
bit weird but I mean I did go kind of

649.76 --> 654.68
like when I get trolled eventually and

652.279 --> 655.6
it just keeps going I just start to

654.68 --> 658.5999999999999
throw

655.6 --> 660.6
out the most extreme things that I think

658.6 --> 663.12
will reduc the most cognitive

660.6 --> 666.6800000000001
dissonance-based headaches in

663.12 --> 668.88
people I it's like I use my knowledge in

666.68 --> 670.92
a weaponized way and so I rolled that

668.88 --> 672.92
out yesterday but I was like completely

670.92 --> 675.639
just saying like no the equator is a

672.92 --> 678.5999999999999
straight line I don't know that exactly

675.639 --> 683.0
with certainty but I

678.6 --> 683.0
assume there's something going on with

687.68 --> 694.1999999999999
it and I do actually think that it is

691.6 --> 698.36
the most likely a straight

694.2 --> 701.32
line but it could also be a yeah an

698.36 --> 705.24
arc it just does not seem to be an

701.32 --> 708.12
actual Circle in space I mean the map

705.24 --> 711.639
projection the dis basic map projection

708.12 --> 714.36
makes it look like a circle but I don't

711.639 --> 716.2
think that it actually is one I think

714.36 --> 717.9590000000001
that's just how the map projection has

716.2 --> 720.1600000000001
been

717.959 --> 722.2399999999999
created

720.16 --> 725.04
and I don't think that the North Pole is

722.24 --> 725.04
a point

725.6 --> 731.36
either I think that the North Pole is

728.519 --> 731.36
basically like a

732.92 --> 737.4399999999999
ridge

735.44 --> 740.9200000000001
or

737.44 --> 744.839
a what do you call that a mountain

740.92 --> 744.8389999999999
range with rivers coming

745.399 --> 752.56
out mountain range with four rivers

750.12 --> 756.36
that all lead to an like an inner ocean

752.56 --> 759.1199999999999
Beyond I mean all of those descriptions

756.36 --> 762.399
all fit perfectly within a rectangular

759.12 --> 763.24
looping model or above it to the north

762.399 --> 767.6
of

763.24 --> 773.55
it and all the descript it all fits

767.6 --> 777.01
perfectly it does not fit any disc model

773.55 --> 777.01
[Music]

777.839 --> 782.1600000000001
though

780.24 --> 784.0
right so also want to ask you guys if

782.16 --> 787.399
you're ready for

784.0 --> 789.199
it indeed don't address any Trolls but

787.399 --> 791.8
if you could assist with the Banning

789.199 --> 795.279
that would be great I mean I'll probably

791.8 --> 798.3599999999999
handle most of it but when I go on a on

795.279 --> 802.24
a roll with talking it would be great if

798.36 --> 805.24
somebody like took over Banning

802.24 --> 805.24
duties

807.76 --> 812.959
thanks

809.76 --> 816.519
when the AE

812.959 --> 818.68
map wraps the land around the

816.519 --> 823.16
pole think of a

818.68 --> 826.279
globe well it does that and

823.16 --> 830.959
then that disc is wrapped around the

826.279 --> 830.959
globe and like tied in at the

833.959 --> 837.279
end thanks

837.759 --> 840.759
Mojo

849.56 --> 852.199
see if this

853.32 --> 856.32
works

860.759 --> 865.639
uh does MO have a rench yeah I gave him

867.68 --> 870.68
one

879.24 --> 883.92
I don't know how we found out though

881.399 --> 886.49
without saying

883.92 --> 889.7299999999999
anything that's kind of

886.49 --> 889.73
[Music]

890.0 --> 895.199
weird hey ter 306 good to see

897.68 --> 901.8389999999999
you

900.16 --> 905.48
You Got a notification oh you get a

901.839 --> 905.48
notification for that

905.639 --> 909.72
huh I didn't know that that's

914.48 --> 919.639
interesting they moved some land

920.68 --> 923.68
around

927.6 --> 930.6
maybe

948.87 --> 952.09
[Music]

955.319 --> 961.56
but what they definitely did do is like

958.199 --> 965.3599999999999
basically Al use the the projection the

961.56 --> 965.3599999999999
map projection like a wrapping

977.12 --> 982.48
paper I can't just ban

980.279 --> 986.36
everyone yeah but I'm not Banning

982.48 --> 990.24
everyone I'm just Banning trolls that

986.36 --> 992.639
somehow manage to be able to unblock

990.24 --> 995.04
themselves seems like the timeout does

992.639 --> 995.04
work

1002.79 --> 1006.66
[Music]

1012.32 --> 1017.23
[Music]

1017.48 --> 1020.48
though

1024.6 --> 1029.6
right but yeah the problem is is that

1027.28 --> 1032.52
there are not that

1029.6 --> 1037.079
many

1032.52 --> 1039.4
sources like there's no as far as I know

1037.079 --> 1042.3999999999999
like a raw

1039.4 --> 1046.2800000000002
data cartisian

1042.4 --> 1050.0
map I mean there's like there's like

1046.28 --> 1051.32
data influx there is like data Maps but

1050.0 --> 1054.28
hey tin foil

1051.32 --> 1057.72
cat how come you Shadow band I Didn't Do

1054.28 --> 1057.72
It tin foil

1058.28 --> 1066.16
cat but people here on my channel tend

1061.919 --> 1068.1200000000001
to like there's just some bastard that's

1066.16 --> 1070.8400000000001
just messing around with the YouTube

1068.12 --> 1073.4399999999998
moderation or whatever I don't know how

1070.84 --> 1077.3999999999999
he's doing it but he's like

1073.44 --> 1079.039
keeps Banning people that don't have

1077.4 --> 1081.72
wrenches

1079.039 --> 1081.72
and you're kind of

1087.44 --> 1093.24
new but just let me know and that I will

1091.039 --> 1095.559
unban you there's a couple of people

1093.24 --> 1098.919
that keep getting

1095.559 --> 1098.9189999999999
banned not

1107.32 --> 1111.08
everybody

1109.08 --> 1115.1999999999998
what's going on

1111.08 --> 1115.1999999999998
here you been in for

1117.96 --> 1123.48
no well maybe with the wrenches what the

1120.44 --> 1123.48
hell's going on with the

1137.32 --> 1140.32
video

1144.36 --> 1147.51
[Music]

1153.159 --> 1156.72
wow okay that was some weird stalling

1155.08 --> 1159.6399999999999
going

1156.72 --> 1161.32
on seems like it's back to normal I

1159.64 --> 1162.4
think it was internet based it was just

1161.32 --> 1164.76
no

1162.4 --> 1167.24
signal there was no sign that there was

1164.76 --> 1170.24
anything wrong

1167.24 --> 1170.24
weird

1170.28 --> 1177.76
uh but infiltrated perhaps

1173.96 --> 1181.52
somebody among the wrenches or

1177.76 --> 1183.559
something but I got just really sick

2416.839 --> 2420.7999999999997
where it's only about

2422.72 --> 2429.7999999999997

before the stream and not

2443.839 --> 2449.48
during yeah I can't I can't do anything

it

2455.319 --> 2459.8
works

2458.0 --> 2461.64

2736.24 --> 2740.0
on

but I don't know maybe it's just not for

2740.0 --> 2745.92
Windows 7 or

2741.72 --> 2748.64
something cuz that isn't

2745.92 --> 2752.359
happening it's nice that it says all

2748.64 --> 2752.359
these options are there but they

2754.88 --> 2757.88
aren't

2775.559 --> 2778.3190000000004

I'm dependent on the chat to to be able

2816.24 --> 2824.4399999999996

2824.44 --> 2827.76
interesting so

2833.4 --> 2840.119
infiltrators that use it to ban people

2837.599 --> 2844.7200000000003
that I don't want to have banned

2840.119 --> 2847.7200000000003
and this like a back and forth

2844.72 --> 2847.72
dynamic

2848.04 --> 2854.4

there I don't get

3023.44 --> 3028.4
it so I've had some weird installation

banana otherwise I would have it I I

3031.96 --> 3038.04
have it in I have it installed even on

tells me to do things that I literally

3052.839 --> 3058.839
am incapable of doing with this computer

3055.68 --> 3062.52
installation so it's like yeah

3058.839 --> 3062.52
well that's that

3073.319 --> 3080.359
then 800 86,000 seconds of jail time is

3078.48 --> 3084.2400000000002
more harsh than medieval

3080.359 --> 3084.24

3207.24 --> 3211.9399999999996
[Music]

3216.48 --> 3223.44
the

3218.16 --> 3225.72
$3 is that holy [ __ ] is that what they

3223.44 --> 3228.7200000000003
pay for trolling

3225.72 --> 3228.72
terret

3231.079 --> 3237.079
damn and I thought that I was

3233.88 --> 3239.76
doing that I was

3237.079 --> 3241.6400000000003
cheap there's troll are you serious

3239.76 --> 3245.0400000000004
there there's trolls out there that do

3241.64 --> 3245.04
that for like three bucks a

3249.2 --> 3252.2
day

3255.559 --> 3264.079
poof

3256.66 --> 3267.0789999999997
[Music]

3264.079 --> 3267.079
250

3275.2 --> 3279.5589999999997
competition in Satan yeah I guess that

3277.44 --> 3284.28
the trolls these days just do it for the

3279.559 --> 3284.28
honor for just wanting to be the special

3288.24 --> 3293.4399999999996
boy it is weird though that indeed there

3291.04 --> 3295.599
is so much competition in Satan's pit

3293.44 --> 3297.4
and not just like with trolls it's like

3295.599 --> 3300.4
with

3297.4 --> 3300.4
politicians

3302.24 --> 3308.4799999999996
that like it used to be like oh yeah

3305.48 --> 3310.48
we're yeah we're evil but yeah at least

3308.48 --> 3313.2400000000002
we got we can get things under control

3310.48 --> 3315.88
and we can have some compensation for

3313.24 --> 3316.72
the sacrifice we're basically making now

3315.88 --> 3321.28
it's

3316.72 --> 3325.0789999999997
like no I'll just do the craziest [ __ ]

3321.28 --> 3327.0
and just because haha because I did it

3325.079 --> 3329.96
and you actually don't really get even

3327.0 --> 3334.16
that much out of it like what the [ __ ]

3329.96 --> 3336.599
is going on I guess that's what happens

3334.16 --> 3340.0789999999997
when yeah there's a lot of competition

3336.599 --> 3340.079
in Satan's pit as you

3340.16 --> 3345.24
said people just like start to forget

3343.44 --> 3347.039
they're actually people and the devils

3345.24 --> 3351.1189999999997
in them take over and they just start to

3347.039 --> 3352.48
do crazy [ __ ] for the evil honor of it

3351.119 --> 3357.0
or

3352.48 --> 3357.0
something sounds really ridiculous but

3357.28 --> 3361.2000000000003
but it does seem to

3375.799 --> 3380.599
happen I just can't imagine that people

3378.52 --> 3382.319
would end up in a position where they

3380.599 --> 3386.839
think

3382.319 --> 3389.2799999999997
that just nagging somebody

3386.839 --> 3392.839
like that's a good deed like what the

3389.28 --> 3392.8390000000004
[ __ ] is wrong with this world

3410.72 --> 3417.319
man right anyway let's move on where

3415.039 --> 3417.3190000000004
talking

3432.4 --> 3437.0

3442.16 --> 3449.2

again the [ __ ] out of here

3503.72 --> 3506.72

3522.839 --> 3527.319
there certainly a lot of people that

3524.319 --> 3530.48
just like to sneak in here

3527.319 --> 3532.799
somehow so weird like why do you want to

3530.48 --> 3536.72
sneak into like a

3532.799 --> 3536.72
circle why do people do

3537.88 --> 3545.2000000000003
that what's so freaking important about

3540.96 --> 3545.2
sneaking in here like I don't get

3547.44 --> 3552.559
it hey Daniel Robel I haven't seen you

3550.319 --> 3552.5589999999997
in a

3558.839 --> 3562.2
while how you

3563.64 --> 3566.64
doing

3569.87 --> 3573.0299999999997
[Music]

3588.68 --> 3593.2799999999997
standard

3589.96 --> 3596.64
protocol all troll get

3593.28 --> 3596.6400000000003
86 timeout

3597.76 --> 3603.3590000000004
out well if that would be interesting to

3601.28 --> 3605.599
but I can't do it literally I don't have

3603.359 --> 3605.5989999999997
that

3610.24 --> 3617.839
option but I mean if you would time them

3613.52 --> 3620.44
out like that yeah that would

3617.839 --> 3623.5589999999997
work been busy with work okay well

3620.44 --> 3626.2400000000002
that's the best kind of busy I

3623.559 --> 3629.44
guess

3626.24 --> 3629.4399999999996
hope it's all worked

3653.52 --> 3656.52
out

3674.359 --> 3679.52
I just thinking about what the hell am I

3676.559 --> 3679.52
going to do for my

3680.319 --> 3688.24
7076 early bird

3683.44 --> 3688.2400000000002
show what am I going to do for that

3701.68 --> 3709.16
one would be pretty bizarre if like

3705.599 --> 3710.7200000000003
exactly during my 7076 show in that day

3709.16 --> 3713.44
that there's like

3710.72 --> 3715.3999999999996
a like an American

3713.44 --> 3718.88
Revolution

3715.4 --> 3718.88
where the White House is taken

3719.52 --> 3727.559
over like actually and then like yeah

3724.48 --> 3729.88
you know all that stuff taken out of

3727.559 --> 3732.1600000000003
power if that would happen exactly when

3729.88 --> 3734.96
I had my 7076

3732.16 --> 3737.3999999999996
show that would be quite

3734.96 --> 3740.799
bizarre I mean it might just I mean

3737.4 --> 3743.48
there's a whole bunch of things in the

3740.799 --> 3745.799
works and I have seen some things in the

3743.48 --> 3749.279
dark world too

3745.799 --> 3749.279
if that means anything to

3749.319 --> 3755.96
anybody like I think there was going to

3751.64 --> 3755.96
be something like that happening at some

3760.16 --> 3766.5989999999997
point and I mean like Biden what he's

3763.48 --> 3769.76
doing just the way he's doing everything

3766.599 --> 3772.599
he is like taking a fall like his entire

3769.76 --> 3777.119
strategy is to take a fall which means

3772.599 --> 3777.119
like he's not counting on it lasting

3779.799 --> 3784.88
forever right it's like he's blowing all

3782.559 --> 3788.4
his gunpowder well you only do that if

3784.88 --> 3788.4
you don't expect to last

3791.52 --> 3799.24

3928.72 --> 3932.68
I mean

3929.799 --> 3934.559
if if Shiva would just like watch that

3932.68 --> 3936.0789999999997
video and like oh you're just yeah

3934.559 --> 3938.48
they're trying to create a person and

3936.079 --> 3941.76
just want to see just see Shiva sit

3938.48 --> 3944.2400000000002
there and just said dirty dirty dirty

3941.76 --> 3947.6800000000003
snake dirty dirty

3944.24 --> 3947.68
snake that would

3951.68 --> 3956.0789999999997
suffice h

3956.68 --> 3959.9199999999996
yes taking a break from

3962.1 --> 3968.16
[Music]

3964.44 --> 3970.44
it but did you probably I know why ter

3968.16 --> 3972.8799999999997
it because there's like all these

3970.44 --> 3975.68
there's like a giant wave of trolls now

3972.88 --> 3979.52
that have probably been paid to like

3975.68 --> 3979.52
attack anybody that goes after

3980.799 --> 3988.279
them like really aggressively so it's

3984.68 --> 3988.279
like they have a Troll Army

3988.359 --> 3992.0
now pretty messed

3995.279 --> 4001.359
up right but I get it if he wants to

3998.16 --> 4005.52
take a break it's not as productive F

4001.359 --> 4009.279
focusing on them but I mean I really do

4005.52 --> 4012.96
want him to review that

4009.279 --> 4016.2
video just I I just want to see it it

4012.96 --> 4019.76
was dude I I when I watched it I had to

4016.2 --> 4024.16
have my hands in front of my eyes it was

4019.76 --> 4027.92
so terrible it was so gross and I I just

4024.16 --> 4030.16
want to see Shea's response to that is

4027.92 --> 4031.279
like I want to see his first viewing of

4030.16 --> 4035.0789999999997
that

4031.279 --> 4037.52
video just to see that like because it

4035.079 --> 4040.119
starts out so terrible right away I just

4037.52 --> 4043.48
want to see his first video viewing

4040.119 --> 4045.279
response on on camera that's pretty much

4043.48 --> 4048.119
it

4045.279 --> 4048.119
just want to see

4051.74 --> 4054.77
[Music]

4056.96 --> 4060.839
that you get that right

4061.38 --> 4069.159
[Music]

4071.68 --> 4080.68
d what

4075.66 --> 4082.16
[Music]

4080.68 --> 4085.44
mud flood

4082.16 --> 4088.2
what something happened every city seems

4085.44 --> 4091.48
to submerged buildings no no not really

4088.2 --> 4093.839
tinf cat but that's a common

4091.48 --> 4097.88
misconception from mud

4093.839 --> 4097.88
flooders it was built like

4102.839 --> 4107.719
that

4105.44 --> 4107.719
it's

4108.85 --> 4112.1990000000005
[Music]

4126.159 --> 4133.2789999999995
weird like yeah just in that was just

4130.679 --> 4136.2390000000005
the style of doing it they would just

4133.279 --> 4140.400000000001
have like a a basement that's

4136.239 --> 4142.5599999999995
like not exactly under ground level but

4140.4 --> 4145.839
just slightly above

4142.56 --> 4147.92
it like that's been a thing for a very

4145.839 --> 4151.04
long time and I have to agree it like it

4147.92 --> 4153.4400000000005
it creates a certain

4151.04 --> 4158.0
tension in the building maybe it's like

4153.44 --> 4160.3189999999995
sort of a fun type effect that makes it

4158.0 --> 4160.319
very

4160.88 --> 4165.64
appealing and always like when I walk

4163.4 --> 4167.2789999999995
past buildings that are like that and it

4165.64 --> 4169.839
look like through a window it like it

4167.279 --> 4173.400000000001
makes me want to get in

4169.839 --> 4173.4
there it's very

4173.759 --> 4179.44
inviting so it's not because of a mud

4176.92 --> 4182.799
flood and just like oh a bunch of mud

4179.44 --> 4185.2789999999995
flooded oh well let's just build the

4182.799 --> 4186.839
streets on this mud

4185.279 --> 4191.679
layer

4186.839 --> 4191.679
what no that's definitely not how that's

4191.719 --> 4196.719
done right and there might have been

4193.799 --> 4199.32
places like completely buried in mud and

4196.719 --> 4201.88
then they left it for a bit and then

4199.32 --> 4204.88
later excavated it

4201.88 --> 4204.88
again

4206.04 --> 4211.28
right so there might have been some kind

4208.56 --> 4215.6
of weird mud

4211.28 --> 4218.5199999999995
event but that's not why buildings are

4215.6 --> 4222.320000000001
seem to be like half

4218.52 --> 4227.52
submerged it's be that's an architecture

4222.32 --> 4231.159
style and I agree with because it's very

4227.52 --> 4231.159000000001
appealing those types of

4238.76 --> 4244.4800000000005
buildings maybe nobody maybe I'm the

4241.32 --> 4244.48
only one that has that

4244.52 --> 4249.0
effect but yeah when there's buildings

4247.44 --> 4253.239
where it's

4249.0 --> 4256.04
like it's not exactly ground level it's

4253.239 --> 4256.04
like slight slightly

4259.44 --> 4267.36
different I find that very

4263.679 --> 4271.96
inviting in a positive way

4267.36 --> 4271.96
so but maybe that's just me I don't

4282.56 --> 4285.56
know

4314.12 --> 4316.8
right so

4317.36 --> 4321.5199999999995
guys what am I going to talk

4327.75 --> 4330.88
[Music]

4342.48 --> 4345.48
about

4364.719 --> 4369.6
hey all right

4366.52 --> 4371.56
just leave the chat and don't say

4369.6 --> 4375.280000000001
anything for five minutes straight

4371.56 --> 4377.92
that's that's cool

4375.28 --> 4377.92
could do that

4378.239 --> 4382.599999999999
too maybe it's the time of the

4383.04 --> 4388.719
day cuz normally I would round Out My

4385.88 --> 4388.719
Show by this

4390.48 --> 4397.599999999999
time but I actually well I started a bit

4393.639 --> 4399.679
late I wanted to go on longer but hey if

4397.6 --> 4402.120000000001
everybody just

4399.679 --> 4404.0
leaves well

4402.12 --> 4405.84
then then

4404.0 --> 4409.48
I will round out the

4405.84 --> 4409.4800000000005
show it's up to

4410.08 --> 4414.4
you oh okay later

4415.199 --> 4419.0
terret see you tomorrow

4432.36 --> 4435.36
maybe

4437.96 --> 4443.28
right but yeah I mean the mud flood

4441.04 --> 4445.159
there is something that yeah that people

4443.28 --> 4447.5199999999995
think that happened in that

4445.159 --> 4449.839999999999
sense there might have definitely been

4447.52 --> 4454.040000000001
regions where something like that

4449.84 --> 4457.159000000001
happened but much more interesting

4454.04 --> 4459.8
is instead of the idea that oh it all

4457.159 --> 4461.199
got flooded with mud and then they had

4459.8 --> 4465.0
to dig it out or

4461.199 --> 4467.839999999999
something or they just left it like that

4465.0 --> 4470.76
much more interesting is that so many

4467.84 --> 4473.2390000000005
places like big cities and all that have

4470.76 --> 4476.679
been built on

4473.239 --> 4478.599999999999
catacombs like not just

4476.679 --> 4482.2390000000005
Paris like

4478.6 --> 4484.96
London this weird

4482.239 --> 4488.28
underground stuff

4484.96 --> 4492.08
too like that's not mud flood that's

4488.28 --> 4495.28
like really old buildings that are just

4492.08 --> 4495.28
sitting under there

4499.28 --> 4501.96
that is really

4502.84 --> 4509.6
mysterious

4504.84 --> 4513.4800000000005
cuz the way that's all built like

4509.6 --> 4516.6
defies the official understanding of the

4513.48 --> 4519.638999999999
capabilities of

4516.6 --> 4522.1990000000005
antiquity yeah that's what's so

4519.639 --> 4525.1990000000005
interesting about those

4522.199 --> 4525.199
places

4530.32 --> 4535.159
that's like all this stuff is just there

4532.84 --> 4537.159000000001
and it's like yeah but

4535.159 --> 4540.679
that's that's

4537.159 --> 4543.5199999999995
like more than you would expect there to

4540.679 --> 4546.6
be it's always it isn't it it's like

4543.52 --> 4550.4400000000005
there's always more than You' expect

4546.6 --> 4553.719
there to be based on historical

4550.44 --> 4556.96
understanding what we're taught about it

4553.719 --> 4556.96
there's always more of

4557.76 --> 4560.9890000000005
[Music]

4569.679 --> 4577.88
it like I still like where are the

4573.56 --> 4582.120000000001
museums or a museum in England about

4577.88 --> 4585.4800000000005
those the tube transport

4582.12 --> 4590.719
like 19th century I

4585.48 --> 4590.718999999999
think had like this capsule

4591.48 --> 4598.4
transport where it' basically be shot

4594.84 --> 4601.0
around a bunch of tubes but was really

4598.4 --> 4602.36
quick until things like started to go

4601.0 --> 4605.0
wrong and then it was like a giant

4602.36 --> 4606.7699999999995
horror movie every time it went wrong

4605.0 --> 4608.28
and that's probably why they

4606.77 --> 4610.56
[Music]

4608.28 --> 4613.36
quit cuz it was

4610.56 --> 4614.56
just once something went wrong it it was

4613.36 --> 4617.0
all

4614.56 --> 4619.679
[ __ ] like when something goes wrong

4617.0 --> 4621.12
with a car you crash or whatever yeah

4619.679 --> 4623.4800000000005
you can go

4621.12 --> 4626.12
there get the

4623.48 --> 4628.0
ambulance haul off the carts but when

4626.12 --> 4630.199
something goes wrong in a tube or

4628.0 --> 4631.36
whatever yeah it's literally now stuck

4630.199 --> 4635.96
in a

4631.36 --> 4635.96
tube like underground so it's pretty

4642.0 --> 4645.0
[ __ ]

4648.4 --> 4654.12
but I mean there like that's a

4651.56 --> 4656.76
historical thing a technological

4654.12 --> 4658.719
societal historical thing that was

4656.76 --> 4661.8
there in

4658.719 --> 4663.4800000000005
England it was there it's like steampunk

4661.8 --> 4665.679
era

4663.48 --> 4669.12
Tech it was

4665.679 --> 4672.28
there nobody mentions it it's like it's

4669.12 --> 4675.199
not an official part of History even

4672.28 --> 4677.88
though it is is officially

4675.199 --> 4681.159
there like why don't they talk about

4677.88 --> 4683.96
that stuff isn't that just fascinating

4681.159 --> 4683.96
that that was

4695.48 --> 4704.919999999999
there and like there was a lot of steam

4699.8 --> 4704.92
powered and electric powered devices

4724.199 --> 4729.759999999999
so oh you went cool every explores in

4727.96 --> 4731.56
those underground places yeah it does

4729.76 --> 4733.96
get

4731.56 --> 4738.1990000000005
wow it almost almost feels like you're

4733.96 --> 4738.199
just going into a Dungeons and Dragons

4740.96 --> 4747.76
dungeon like what the

4744.719 --> 4752.639
hell how did I arrive in Antiquity all

4747.76 --> 4752.639
of a sudden it's just sitting

4761.84 --> 4769.38
there

4764.57 --> 4769.38
[Music]

4771.55 --> 4779.28
[Music]

4774.8 --> 4782.56
you were on yeah yeah I know that

4779.28 --> 4784.36
channel Electro generating buildings

4782.56 --> 4788.8
yeah

4784.36 --> 4788.799999999999
it's there's something about

4789.32 --> 4796.759999999999
it but I think that it's like it's bit

4793.199 --> 4800.28
exaggerated the ideas about it but I

4796.76 --> 4804.639
think for one this is an older idea of

4800.28 --> 4807.5599999999995
mine from like 2017

4804.639 --> 4811.6
18 about how the pyramids are

4807.56 --> 4814.8
hydroelectric generators like field

4811.6 --> 4818.679
generators that used water streaming

4814.8 --> 4821.159000000001
underneath it in specific channels that

4818.679 --> 4824.36
generate electricity that are then

4821.159 --> 4827.12
enhanced by the stone workings in the

4824.36 --> 4829.199
pyramid that then caus like the entire

4827.12 --> 4832.36
pyramid

4829.199 --> 4834.5199999999995
surface to become like polarized or

4832.36 --> 4838.04
whatever like

4834.52 --> 4839.1990000000005
electrified that like has a a healing

4838.04 --> 4842.44
type

4839.199 --> 4842.44
energy to

4842.719 --> 4847.21
it and I think that that's what they

4844.88 --> 4850.2390000000005
were used for

4847.21 --> 4853.199
[Music]

4850.239 --> 4854.599999999999
originally and that basically they could

4853.199 --> 4856.48
even help

4854.6 --> 4860.159000000001
maintain

4856.48 --> 4863.08
Giants so that they would have to eat

4860.159 --> 4868.0
less by just being in the presence of

4863.08 --> 4868.0
these hydroelectric generators known as

4869.239 --> 4876.4
pyramids and I'm talking big giants not

4872.76 --> 4880.4400000000005
just like o he's a really large man I'm

4876.4 --> 4880.44
talking like really freaking

4881.639 --> 4888.04
huge because yeah the bigger you are the

4885.639 --> 4891.28
more they're going to require food to

4888.04 --> 4894.679
just regenerate everything that they

4891.28 --> 4897.5599999999995
are but my theory was is that the in the

4894.679 --> 4900.639
presence of these field generators they

4897.56 --> 4902.400000000001
would basically like they would consume

4900.639 --> 4906.719
the energy like

4902.4 --> 4909.239
Mana which would require them to eat

4906.719 --> 4912.12
less which was always the main problem

4909.239 --> 4914.28
with giants is that they ate so much but

4912.12 --> 4918.12
they could do incredible

4914.28 --> 4922.259999999999
work like literal Feats that normal

4918.12 --> 4925.479
people just cannot even get close to

4922.26 --> 4925.479
[Music]

4941.56 --> 4947.280000000001
achieving

4944.159 --> 4949.28
tomatic patterns in water that is cool

4947.28 --> 4952.88
yeah yeah by the way those types of

4949.28 --> 4955.239
Chambers also exist within the

4952.88 --> 4958.4400000000005
pyramids was no wait

4955.239 --> 4961.08
not there's like special

4958.44 --> 4963.44
Chambers alongside the pyramids like

4961.08 --> 4965.5599999999995
where the hell was that I'm not an

4963.44 --> 4967.44
expert like I don't know the exact

4965.56 --> 4969.4800000000005
details I just remember it was like kind

4967.44 --> 4972.0
of like put into the same documentary

4969.48 --> 4975.959999999999
about Pyramids of Giza that there are

4972.0 --> 4975.96
like sound healing Chambers

4978.44 --> 4984.4
there where you just go in and you make

4980.84 --> 4987.4400000000005
a sound and then like that just making a

4984.4 --> 4988.28
sound there just has a healing influence

4987.44 --> 4990.678999999999
pretty

4988.28 --> 4992.88
incredible but it there's a very good

4990.679 --> 4994.4800000000005
chance that churches were

4992.88 --> 4997.52
basically

4994.48 --> 5001.239
designed in an attempt to mimic the

4997.52 --> 5004.4800000000005
healing Sound Chamber

5001.239 --> 5004.48
effects through

5004.6 --> 5010.4800000000005
architecture through knowledge of

5006.52 --> 5010.4800000000005
simatics and yeah all

5014.26 --> 5017.409000000001
[Music]

5019.52 --> 5024.84
that right and who started building the

5022.48 --> 5027.0
churches no mostly the Catholic Church

5024.84 --> 5030.8
which is

5027.0 --> 5034.12
like the Antichrist church the church

5030.8 --> 5035.679
that like took all it's like the wizard

5034.12 --> 5038.199
Church in a way it's almost like The

5035.679 --> 5041.8
Magicians Church they just take all the

5038.199 --> 5045.4
ls everything and then just cram it in

5041.8 --> 5047.679
there and they've used that I mean

5045.4 --> 5049.159
they've used like ancient Egyptian

5047.679 --> 5052.4
knowledge and

5049.159 --> 5055.04
stuff they just use everything that's

5052.4 --> 5055.04
the Catholic

5056.159 --> 5061.36
Church like use it all for themselves

5059.08 --> 5065.08
but deny

5061.36 --> 5066.92
it deny them worth so just you take all

5065.08 --> 5068.6
the value you just claim it's always

5066.92 --> 5070.76
been

5068.6 --> 5073.159000000001
yours that's kind of what the Catholic

5070.76 --> 5073.159000000001
Church

5077.45 --> 5086.8
[Music]

5083.88 --> 5089.6
did but yeah it has resulted into a

5086.8 --> 5091.360000000001
whole bunch of Miracles basically like

5089.6 --> 5093.08
miraculous

5091.36 --> 5097.5599999999995
designs

5093.08 --> 5100.32
an interesting features CU a lot of

5097.56 --> 5103.88
these people that are part of the church

5100.32 --> 5107.84
were into that they were into the

5103.88 --> 5107.84
occult figuring it all

5121.28 --> 5124.28
out

5132.159 --> 5137.08
think sound of vibration could have been

5133.8 --> 5137.08
used to move pyramid

5142.28 --> 5147.239
blocks

5144.239 --> 5147.239
perhaps

5151.28 --> 5154.36
maybe

5153.44 --> 5157.44
but I

5154.36 --> 5160.32
mean they probably wouldn't really have

5157.44 --> 5163.119
to I mean they might use tricks to like

5160.32 --> 5164.5599999999995
use sound to like maneuver things into

5163.119 --> 5167.0
place very

5164.56 --> 5168.96
carefully that sort of thing they might

5167.0 --> 5171.239
have used it like that but I think

5168.96 --> 5173.8
overall they just kind of

5171.239 --> 5178.48
used well

5173.8 --> 5178.4800000000005
Giants to carry really big

5179.04 --> 5186.36
stuff and they also well just

5183.0 --> 5188.639
Stone cast like geopolymer they just

5186.36 --> 5192.5199999999995
cast it into

5188.639 --> 5196.400000000001
place a lot I think most of the pyramids

5192.52 --> 5198.6
is cast in place it's not all just

5196.4 --> 5202.759999999999
blocks that have been hauled from some

5198.6 --> 5202.76
query Quarry

5204.84 --> 5212.8
right some definitely

5209.8 --> 5216.04
were but a lot of is just

5212.8 --> 5218.04
cast in place you just take a mold you

5216.04 --> 5220.96
cast it it's like concrete except it

5218.04 --> 5223.96
wasn't concrete it was geopol it's like

5220.96 --> 5226.679
it it's better than concrete concrete is

5223.96 --> 5230.08
quick but it also erodes and all

5226.679 --> 5232.8
that they just did concrete but with

5230.08 --> 5235.199
serious Stone and it like turns into

5232.8 --> 5238.119000000001
very serious stone that just lasts the

5235.199 --> 5241.119
test of time it doesn't

5238.119 --> 5244.119
erode like concrete

5241.119 --> 5244.119
does

5266.679 --> 5272.4400000000005
right but I could imagine that if they

5268.239 --> 5275.199
had to fit blocks perfectly that they

5272.44 --> 5278.5599999999995
might like unleash a bunch of vibrations

5275.199 --> 5281.44
on it like heavy sound to Make

5278.56 --> 5283.92
It Shake in place perfect like to make

5281.44 --> 5286.96
it perfectly slip is it would be

5283.92 --> 5290.36
slightly stuck and but if you just

5286.96 --> 5293.6
shake like super heavy shaking that it

5290.36 --> 5295.759999999999
just it just everything wobbles around

5293.6 --> 5300.6
and then it just falls into place like

5295.76 --> 5300.6
that's a technique they might have used

5300.679 --> 5304.04
right just

5326.4 --> 5333.08
thinking right but I don't think they

5328.88 --> 5336.2390000000005
actually use like continuous sound

5333.08 --> 5339.36
to lift a giant object off the ground

5336.239 --> 5341.32
and move it around or something I mean

5339.36 --> 5343.679
because it's so incredibly inefficient

5341.32 --> 5346.96
to just keep that continually going you

5343.679 --> 5348.84
know how much impact

5346.96 --> 5352.119
sound

5348.84 --> 5354.679
makes when it's loud enough to literally

5352.119 --> 5358.239
lift giant objects I mean that's going

5354.679 --> 5359.84
to be a very impactful amount of sound

5358.239 --> 5361.759999999999
you don't want to like do that

5359.84 --> 5365.719
continually you always want to reserve

5361.76 --> 5369.84
that kind of heavy in influential stuff

5365.719 --> 5373.639
for short moments not

5369.84 --> 5373.639
continuous everybody would be

5376.01 --> 5379.9490000000005
[Music]

5380.4 --> 5388.92
deaf monolithic house using some kind of

5383.44 --> 5388.919999999999
frequency device allegedly tin for

5390.92 --> 5394.6
cat

5392.48 --> 5399.638999999999
there's also just a big chance that he

5394.6 --> 5399.639
just cast it that he just created

5403.239 --> 5410.879999999999
geopolymer you see tinf cat I believe

5407.52 --> 5414.639
it's actually part of a Freemasonry

5410.88 --> 5417.1990000000005
originated scam to convince everybody

5414.639 --> 5420.2390000000005
that stone casting doesn't

5417.199 --> 5423.199
exist you only have concrete right oh

5420.239 --> 5427.08
this is all oh this is all original

5423.199 --> 5427.08
Stone from the query like

5428.159 --> 5431.159
[ __ ]

5432.04 --> 5438.639
no that's very rare like they might have

5436.119 --> 5441.88
had some pieces that were like just like

5438.639 --> 5446.639
that from queries quaries

5441.88 --> 5451.679
but like Stone casting it was a big big

5446.639 --> 5453.6
thing in Antiquity like they all did it

5451.679 --> 5456.4400000000005
that that's how the giant monolithic

5453.6 --> 5459.8
structures are there it's all cast none

5456.44 --> 5461.638999999999
of that is like cut out of a quarry I

5459.8 --> 5464.96
keep calling it

5461.639 --> 5468.119
quy what is it Quarry query no it's

5464.96 --> 5468.119
Quarry isn't it

5476.119 --> 5483.88
yeah right how they made it is much more

5479.719 --> 5488.56
likely they just min the rough

5483.88 --> 5490.8
material mostly like ground it up they

5488.56 --> 5494.1990000000005
add the components the chemical

5490.8 --> 5496.88
components that they make and

5494.199 --> 5499.5599999999995
refine I mean it couldn't have been that

5496.88 --> 5500.96
hard you just have to find the right

5499.56 --> 5503.8
[Music]

5500.96 --> 5507.84
materials you take it you just keep

5503.8 --> 5510.2390000000005
shoving it in and and then just make it

5507.84 --> 5512.4800000000005
and then suddenly yeah after a while you

5510.239 --> 5516.839999999999
have like this really

5512.48 --> 5519.44
heavy hard stone that just last forever

5516.84 --> 5523.0
you can cast it into

5519.44 --> 5525.919999999999
place and it's like it's always been

5523.0 --> 5528.679
there and then later all these nonsense

5525.92 --> 5533.8
storytellers just say oh all they all

5528.679 --> 5537.159
cut it out of they all chiseled it out

5533.8 --> 5542.2390000000005
of a quarry and then lifted it it's hor

5537.159 --> 5549.0
[ __ ] dude no they did not do that

5542.239 --> 5553.5199999999995
that yeah they cast it they cast all of

5549.0 --> 5556.239
that yeah people weren't just like

5553.52 --> 5559.1990000000005
lifting giant Stones

5556.239 --> 5561.638999999999
everywhere all the time on Industrial

5559.199 --> 5563.759999999999
Level because that's a really shitty way

5561.639 --> 5566.36
to

5563.76 --> 5570.0
work it

5566.36 --> 5572.159
sucks like cutting out giant stones and

5570.0 --> 5576.0
transporting giant stones

5572.159 --> 5580.44
it sucks it's a hazard accidents happen

5576.0 --> 5585.04
people get killed you don't do that it

5580.44 --> 5588.799999999999
sucks yeah what you do is you cast it in

5585.04 --> 5591.199
place much safer much cheaper and no

5588.8 --> 5596.400000000001
freaking

5591.199 --> 5596.4
Hazard nobody gets crushed by

5596.92 --> 5603.56
accident yeah yeah Paul Cook definitely

5599.76 --> 5603.56
now he knows all about that stuff

5603.92 --> 5606.56
five roads

5609.159 --> 5614.48
indeed right and if there's like certain

5611.92 --> 5617.04
unique big

5614.48 --> 5620.239
Stones where you can like see like it's

5617.04 --> 5622.56
a granite pattern or all that well

5620.239 --> 5625.4
there's a chance that some Stones could

5622.56 --> 5627.280000000001
have been cut from aari but I mean

5625.4 --> 5631.159
they're not going to like take like

5627.28 --> 5635.0
10,000 giant zones from a quarry and

5631.159 --> 5636.638999999999
like move move it miles there's no way

5635.0 --> 5640.28
it's

5636.639 --> 5642.639
insane they might like do that like one

5640.28 --> 5647.0
time or twice or something with some

5642.639 --> 5649.36
really key pieces that you can't cast

5647.0 --> 5653.32
you can't cast it like that it has to be

5649.36 --> 5656.48
that original piece of stone

5653.32 --> 5659.639
right but for the majority it just the

5656.48 --> 5662.759999999999
the patchwor and the the the

5659.639 --> 5666.32
framework the general stuff

5662.76 --> 5669.52
you're not going to like cut a bunch of

5666.32 --> 5672.239
stones from quaries and then haul them

5669.52 --> 5676.040000000001
Miles and Miles Away tens of thousands

5672.239 --> 5680.4
like you you out of [ __ ] mind nobody

5676.04 --> 5684.159
does that that's crazy that's

5680.4 --> 5686.32
stupid it'll take forever the losses

5684.159 --> 5689.4
will be immense and what the [ __ ] do you

5686.32 --> 5692.32
get out of it nothing a

5689.4 --> 5693.44
giant big thing

5692.32 --> 5696.28
that does

5693.44 --> 5699.119
nothing barely anything like it's not

5696.28 --> 5701.96
worth it they they didn't make it like

5699.119 --> 5701.96
that it's totally

5707.32 --> 5714.0
illogical they cast it in place cuz they

5711.119 --> 5715.36
could do that and that way you can make

5714.0 --> 5716.88
it

5715.36 --> 5722.0
perfect

5716.88 --> 5725.0
yeah you can't cut stones

5722.0 --> 5728.159
like hand chisel cut them however you

5725.0 --> 5731.52
even if you do machine work and then put

5728.159 --> 5735.32
all those separately cut Stones together

5731.52 --> 5738.96
in a gigantic structure and then make it

5735.32 --> 5742.04
fit seamlessly it doesn't work that way

5738.96 --> 5745.119
at all the only way you can make a

5742.04 --> 5751.0
gigantic structure like that fit

5745.119 --> 5754.36
seamlessly is guess what you cast it

5751.0 --> 5757.04
yeah that's even in Modern Skyscrapers

5754.36 --> 5761.4
yeah how do you think it all

5757.04 --> 5764.5199999999995
fits it's because they cast the

5761.4 --> 5767.48
concrete they put the steel frames and

5764.52 --> 5770.2390000000005
then they cast the concrete they don't

5767.48 --> 5772.48
whole blocks and then just oh it has to

5770.239 --> 5775.199
yeah it just fits perfectly no no it

5772.48 --> 5778.44
fits perfectly because it's

5775.199 --> 5783.32
cast and so are the majority of the

5778.44 --> 5783.32
pyramid Stones it's cast stone

5783.88 --> 5791.56
it's not one piece it's not one one

5788.159 --> 5794.92
casting it's separate

5791.56 --> 5797.84
castings they were cast in place

5794.92 --> 5800.08
separate Stones even with separate

5797.84 --> 5803.28
materials yeah because it doesn't just

5800.08 --> 5806.92
have to be one concrete they could cast

5803.28 --> 5809.8
it in different ways with different

5806.92 --> 5812.88
components for the

5809.8 --> 5814.1990000000005
stone I mean there's a chance that the

5812.88 --> 5815.92
during the Egyptian times when the

5814.199 --> 5818.159
pyramids were built that they knew how

5815.92 --> 5822.84
to like cast geopolymer that would

5818.159 --> 5827.32
result into pink gr uh what is it the

5822.84 --> 5829.92
pink quartz that you could cast pink

5827.32 --> 5832.32
quartz like a

5829.92 --> 5835.119
geopolymer is Nathan's computer still

5832.32 --> 5835.119
broken

5840.199 --> 5848.199
yes they get the steel no I I was just

5845.92 --> 5850.52
comparing the example with modern steel

5848.199 --> 5852.799999999999
frame buildings I'm not saying they had

5850.52 --> 5857.88
steel during

5852.8 --> 5857.88
Egypt during the pyramids not saying

5859.6 --> 5862.839
[Music]

5864.56 --> 5870.1990000000005
that although they did have batteries

5868.119 --> 5873.199
you

5870.199 --> 5873.199
know

5874.44 --> 5883.239
they did actually have lamps

5877.639 --> 5883.2390000000005
electricity but I mean steel no how dare

5892.599 --> 5897.08
you yeah let's not do that

5900.119 --> 5903.119
okay

5915.45 --> 5923.5199999999995
[Music]

5924.92 --> 5927.719
aan

5929.32 --> 5933.119
oisk where's that

5951.599 --> 5954.84
unfinished over

5957.8 --> 5963.04
this

5960.04 --> 5963.04
huh

5990.04 --> 5993.04
interesting

6009.32 --> 6013.5199999999995
okay well I guess that that Obelisk was

6011.28 --> 6017.84
not cast

6013.52 --> 6021.56
then perhaps or maybe it it still

6017.84 --> 6023.56
was that the whole thing was actually

6021.56 --> 6027.52
cast all that

6023.56 --> 6030.52
stone they could just cut it

6027.52 --> 6030.52
out

6049.92 --> 6053.88
interesting

6051.44 --> 6056.5199999999995
all right but yeah chisel marks does not

6053.88 --> 6058.32
even necessarily mean that it's that

6056.52 --> 6062.360000000001
it's not

6058.32 --> 6065.44
cast you get that cuz you cast something

6062.36 --> 6065.44
well it might leave

6068.76 --> 6075.599
imperfections or you need detail works

6072.159 --> 6075.598999999999
that you couldn't do with the

6077.96 --> 6084.159
mold so you can still chisel geopolymers

6082.159 --> 6089.08
after they've been

6084.159 --> 6089.08
cast so it doesn't necessarily reveal

6090.08 --> 6096.44
it the hide the geopolymer maybe or

6094.44 --> 6099.4
maybe it was just part of the

6096.44 --> 6102.28
procedure it's just they chisel some

6099.4 --> 6102.28
details in the

6109.0 --> 6116.28
end I mean once G geopolymer hardens up

6113.8 --> 6121.1990000000005
if you still want to work it you're

6116.28 --> 6121.199
probably going to have to use a chisle

6139.76 --> 6142.76
so

6154.599 --> 6157.76
what is The Binding

6158.199 --> 6161.469999999999
agent I'm sorry I don't know the details

6161.119 --> 6167.5199999999995

[Music]

6169.76 --> 6172.76
that

6175.199 --> 6179.638999999999
you swam with a shark in Egypt but you

6177.639 --> 6182.639
didn't get to see the

6179.639 --> 6182.639
fs

6184.0 --> 6189.0
okay there is evidence it was egg

6189.01 --> 6193.84
[Music]

6190.84 --> 6193.84

6202.89 --> 6206.109
[Music]

6210.92 --> 6214.719
seeking or you mean egg

6222.44 --> 6229.678999999999
shells cuz seashells and seashells have

6227.04 --> 6232.679
been used in

6229.679 --> 6232.679
geopolymers

6236.52 --> 6239.719
hey LSG good to see

6248.98 --> 6254.289
[Music]

6256.4 --> 6262.598999999999
you what egg

6258.76 --> 6262.599
white what the hell

6274.96 --> 6279.56
huh that is very strange seeking

6289.56 --> 6292.56
starwater

6293.01 --> 6296.2390000000005
[Music]

6298.32 --> 6304.96
what the hell was are you

6301.91 --> 6304.96
[Music]

6315.639 --> 6320.84

High okay well I'll just take your your

6320.84 --> 6325.119000000001
word on that for now interesting

6326.92 --> 6335.08
though walking on eggshells that's

6329.84 --> 6335.08
hilarious very very astute there Stevie

6349.48 --> 6354.44
Trevor

6351.32 --> 6357.48
it gets even freakier if it's like yeah

6354.44 --> 6360.36
what if they used blood or

6357.48 --> 6362.879999999999
[Music]

6360.36 --> 6365.5599999999995
something that suddenly makes it all

6362.88 --> 6365.56
very

6367.88 --> 6377.779
creepy X is already kind of

6370.79 --> 6377.7789999999995
[Music]

6379.4 --> 6382.4
weird

6399.44 --> 6403.36
liquification

6400.84 --> 6408.679
rounded

6403.36 --> 6408.679
edges yep casting that's the sign of

6409.4 --> 6412.4
casting

6415.36 --> 6422.759999999999
you see with casting it can be brilliant

6419.48 --> 6425.159
because the space it has to be in can

6422.76 --> 6426.92
just be the mold and then whatever you

6425.159 --> 6429.5599999999995
cast it's going to be

6426.92 --> 6431.36
perfect it's going to be absolutely

6429.56 --> 6436.080000000001
seamlessly

6431.36 --> 6436.08
perfect because it's literally cast in

6439.32 --> 6442.32
place

6453.0 --> 6457.76
what's made out of egg white well

6455.239 --> 6460.08
according to seeking star water source

6457.76 --> 6464.119000000001
it's

6460.08 --> 6467.5199999999995
geopolymer so the cast

6464.119 --> 6470.48
stone apparently they use egg

6467.52 --> 6474.360000000001
white as a chemical component for for

6470.48 --> 6474.36
the solid yeah for the reaction of

6514.96 --> 6518.52
Roman roads also

6520.4 --> 6528.598999999999
yeah but that's the weird thing you know

6524.04 --> 6528.599
in history they say that that's

6529.199 --> 6532.199
concrete

6533.639 --> 6538.679
I always was taught that the Romans were

6536.4 --> 6541.5199999999995
the ones who invented concrete and

6538.679 --> 6545.2390000000005
that's they use that to build roads

6541.52 --> 6545.2390000000005
everywhere but it's not

6546.96 --> 6552.36
concrete what do you mean concrete it

6550.199 --> 6557.44
isn't concrete it's freaking geopolymer

6552.36 --> 6557.44
they just cast stone what do you mean

6559.119 --> 6562.119
concrete

6583.36 --> 6589.239
yeah why did they say that all roads

6585.8 --> 6592.119000000001
read lead to Rome it's because Rome

6589.239 --> 6592.119
built all the roads
