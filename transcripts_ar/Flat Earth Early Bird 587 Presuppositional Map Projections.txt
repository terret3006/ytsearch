130.81 --> 137.22
Tamera coffee with me green tea as usual

196.349 --> 204.42
nice huh so anyway yeah lots of activity

201.42 --> 208.5
yesterday lots it's basically up until

204.42 --> 214.82999999999998
like after 4 o'clock just like way too

208.5 --> 218.629
late so I'm not as well rested as I

214.83 --> 218.62900000000002
usually am but I think I'll be ok

219.209 --> 224.489
it was just a very yeah mostly because I

222.42 --> 227.30999999999997
had a really intense conversation with

224.489 --> 230.91
Robin Stanley yesterday and it was kind

227.31 --> 235.22
of a nursed by that afterwards I like I

230.91 --> 237.959
think she got it but just every time

235.22 --> 244.47
like I open up the door like that it

237.959 --> 248.879
always unnerves me like what what right

244.47 --> 251.489
anyway uh get to that that was much

248.879 --> 254.069
later in the night or well it started

251.489 --> 259.19
out late in the evening and yet ended up

254.069 --> 262.2
being a four o'clock call for hours long

259.19 --> 265.05
anyway the Flat Earth debates there was

262.2 --> 269.82
more feedback on the whole concept of

265.05 --> 275.93
fake son again and then it turned pretty

269.82 --> 283.169
much jakey being just like being jakey

275.93 --> 284.91
being even worse than usual yeah and the

283.169 --> 286.32
after show was really good by the way so

284.91 --> 291.59000000000003
looking forward to that on Saturday

286.32 --> 291.59
right should be tomorrow

304.47 --> 310.48
right yeah Owen Benjamin I don't know

308.02 --> 314.5
exactly you know I did tune into it like

310.48 --> 319.69
it the second it went live so but it

314.5 --> 322.12
yeah was overall a fun hangout and he

319.69 --> 324.28
brought like he's always looking to

322.12 --> 327.64
froth with things so he brought like

324.28 --> 329.95
this schematic of types of mustaches and

327.64 --> 333.52
there was like the toothbrush mustache

329.95 --> 335.77
in there she was very almost well almost

333.52 --> 338.44
or yeah I don't know exactly how much

335.77 --> 340.5
how close it is to like Hitler's

338.44 --> 345.42
mustache but that was freaking funny

340.5 --> 348.16
like it's an official style concept I

345.42 --> 351.54
don't know it's just he's just prodding

348.16 --> 351.54
around I think that's hilarious

353.82 --> 359.29
I've kind of wondered for for sometime I

357.76 --> 361.12
don't know not that is that important

359.29 --> 364.45000000000005
really to me like could it be possible

361.12 --> 367.21
that like that whole curse on that type

364.45 --> 373.65999999999997
of mustache could be undone at some

367.21 --> 375.07
point that it would be okay again right

373.66 --> 379.54
yeah well right now it's gonna be a

375.07 --> 382.84
tough one it's a certain group of people

379.54 --> 384.70000000000005
that will not like that anyway yeah

382.84 --> 389.65
there was Owen Benjamin was kind of fun

384.7 --> 391.39
and then yeah Robert Stanley I had this

389.65 --> 396.06
cope pretty much right after that his

391.39 --> 396.06
show ended and then into the night

398.8 --> 409.12
and yeah we talked a lot about our lives

401.319 --> 412.509
comparing it and I still have to let it

409.12 --> 414.36
all sink in because yeah I like it we

412.509 --> 419.22900000000004
ended our co-ed what is it

414.36 --> 426.909
1:30 for me my time 1:30 at night it was

419.229 --> 429.599
still up until 4:00 because just zooming

426.909 --> 429.599
around again

436.71 --> 440.31
anyway I really appreciate Roman

438.72 --> 442.5
Stanley's presence and it was really

440.31 --> 448.58
good to have a long heartfelt

442.5 --> 453.84
conversation so I'm glad we did that I

448.58 --> 462.09
think it was uplifting I guess yeah you

453.84 --> 464.60999999999996
are you're very supportive like you've

462.09 --> 467.94
given me a lot of good things to think

464.61 --> 470.96000000000004
about at least like in response to me

467.94 --> 470.96
showing yourself you know

475.62 --> 480.57
and yeah really we even talked about

477.66 --> 483.27000000000004
relations it's kind of funny now well

480.57 --> 485.79
fun or not so fun I put down some

483.27 --> 490.56
details about my past like how that was

485.79 --> 492.8
like and yeah she's probably a mom yes

490.56 --> 492.8
she is

497.21 --> 503.98999999999995
right but it was interesting because we

502.13 --> 507.65
were also especially just talking about

503.99 --> 510.199
like the mind and action types like what

507.65 --> 511.94
like what do I typically do how do I

510.199 --> 514.37
approach things and then she explained

511.94 --> 518.27
like this is how I typically do approach

514.37 --> 520.399
things and pour out some like very

518.27 --> 522.3489999999999
clearly to me like I really got it like

520.399 --> 527.51
wow that is that is different but that

522.349 --> 537.74
would work you know I got it right three

527.51 --> 540.04
crowns each other Wow anyway she she is

537.74 --> 545.9590000000001
kind of in a bit of a pressure

540.04 --> 549.68
complexity situation though so she also

545.959 --> 552.92
shared some of that to me not gonna talk

549.68 --> 555.529
about that too much but yeah it's it's

552.92 --> 558.86
just that the location she lives is

555.529 --> 567.05
under tension from all kinds of weird

558.86 --> 570.17
[ __ ] that like the city is it the city

567.05 --> 573.4399999999999
functions aren't really functioning

570.17 --> 577.4499999999999
properly like it seems like certain

573.44 --> 577.45
groups are not doing their normal job

580.66 --> 588.13
anyway when she's yeah bothered by that

585.13 --> 590.55
right anyway it's alright

588.13 --> 594.52
[Music]

590.55 --> 596.2299999999999
yeah I had lunch like 15 minutes before

594.52 --> 598.18
the show started because I just thought

596.23 --> 612.33
like no I'm too hungry I can't hold this

598.18 --> 612.3299999999999
but now I'm like still processing it hmm

613.17 --> 621.2199999999999
but anyway yet that and yeah a lot of

618.61 --> 624.04
encouragement basically also for the

621.22 --> 626.65
idea of my book and I have done

624.04 --> 629.62
something you know so yeah right after

626.65 --> 632.02
that call ended I pretty much hung

629.62 --> 635.83
around thinking about it and then I

632.02 --> 637.75
continued watching dark which I finished

635.83 --> 645.87
to the last episode and it is definitely

637.75 --> 651.04
a last episode spoilers I think it's

645.87 --> 653.83
like I don't know but yeah very

651.04 --> 656.38
impressed by it overall and even my

653.83 --> 660.0400000000001
earlier remarks about oh dear

656.38 --> 666.04
like thyme incest I'd kind of take that

660.04 --> 668.23
back like in the end when that yeah once

666.04 --> 670.06
you because there's a lot of weird

668.23 --> 672.25
things happening in this series it's

670.06 --> 674.89
kind of hard to keep track off while

672.25 --> 677.11
it's going and it yeah it's more about

674.89 --> 678.46
the atmosphere and also like yeah

677.11 --> 680.47
there's a lot of people that just don't

678.46 --> 683.08
know certain things and then the other

680.47 --> 686.35
version does and it just gets really

683.08 --> 690.3000000000001
convoluted so you lose to kind of track

686.35 --> 695.8000000000001
but in the end you do realize like wait

690.3 --> 698.7099999999999
okay like they give philosophical back

695.8 --> 700.4499999999999
talk about basically what's going on

698.71 --> 702.46
what the viewer is even witnessing like

700.45 --> 705.22
the people are philosophizing about what

702.46 --> 711.99
they're in a lot and that increases and

705.22 --> 715.69
maximizes at the end really impressed

711.99 --> 720.12
also kind of a freaky little vision

715.69 --> 723.4000000000001
detail I remember somebody telling me

720.12 --> 726.1
when I was and this was in Germany

723.4 --> 732.13
during wave gothic treffen with my ex

726.1 --> 736.12
and apparently somebody told us look at

732.13 --> 739.63
that house do you see that that's they

736.12 --> 746.38
just filmed there for the best science

739.63 --> 748.9
fiction series of the next decade and I

746.38 --> 752.68
was like that creeped me out at the

748.9 --> 754.39
moment like I I was still yeah going

752.68 --> 756.64
through all kinds of weird dark things

754.39 --> 757.75
and I was like ah that's escaped like I

756.64 --> 760.21
almost had a feeling like that's

757.75 --> 761.98
forbidden knowledge or something weird

760.21 --> 764.5
but I remember it now like I've

761.98 --> 769.21
apparently walked past a location that

764.5 --> 776.22
is used in in the series and I think I

769.21 --> 780.13
even recognized it it was like this I

776.22 --> 783.279
don't know this cafe location pretty

780.13 --> 785.5
neat and I think they used it they used

783.279 --> 788.26
the inside of it I don't I'm not

785.5 --> 790.959
entirely sure which building that was

788.26 --> 794.35
gonna be but maybe it's the one like the

790.959 --> 796.66
big like the throne room from the

794.35 --> 799.36
scarred guy I know probably see him

796.66 --> 802.8389999999999
pretty soon the series anyway I asked

799.36 --> 805.54
like this Richie Rich guy and it's all

802.839 --> 809.3800000000001
hopeless the whole thing is so gothic as

805.54 --> 810.8499999999999
hell so but I think that that room that

809.38 --> 813.49
that a little house that I walked past

810.85 --> 815.4
was used in that series as part of the

813.49 --> 818.44
scenario so that was kind of weird

815.4 --> 824.35
realization when I remember that kind of

818.44 --> 830.5200000000001
while watching it's like wait I think I

824.35 --> 834.51
walked right there past it like yeah

830.52 --> 836.73
anyway yeah retrospect it's a really

834.51 --> 842.7
good series but it's absolutely not

836.73 --> 846.48
suitable for children because there's

842.7 --> 850.2
just some really just well really dark

846.48 --> 853.02
[ __ ] in there and like the whole time

850.2 --> 855.839
situation and it would the idea yeah how

853.02 --> 857.43
people respond like you really start to

855.839 --> 861.45
wonder eventually like are some of these

857.43 --> 864.4499999999999
people completely psychotic because they

861.45 --> 866.7900000000001
make like dramatical they do dramatic

864.45 --> 868.4100000000001
things in the assumption that it's gonna

866.79 --> 874.05
lead somewhere but there's no direct

868.41 --> 877.1999999999999
evidence that it does because it seems

874.05 --> 880.05
the currents like even things just like

877.2 --> 883.35
really like people supposedly having

880.05 --> 885.899
been prevented from living because they

883.35 --> 888.5400000000001
killed the father they were born from

885.899 --> 890.22
somebody else like it it changed they

888.54 --> 894.779
were stillborn but they were just

890.22 --> 896.9100000000001
slightly different right that was like a

894.779 --> 899.579
very interesting concept in how the

896.91 --> 901.8
realm would basically rewrite the

899.579 --> 904.26
alterations of the time interventions

901.8 --> 906.0
right it's fascinating

904.26 --> 908.91
look the whole thing was really fast

906.0 --> 911.64
it's a study piece like this series is

908.91 --> 913.86
definitely worth watching and studying

911.64 --> 916.459
maybe even like putting down in a puzzle

913.86 --> 918.72
like what is how did they do this

916.459 --> 920.67
because it is like they really

918.72 --> 923.52
engineered this [ __ ] the Germans worked

920.67 --> 925.77
on this because they really engineered

923.52 --> 928.11
it they they really put it down like a

925.77 --> 931.3389999999999
board and perfected it and make every

928.11 --> 934.02
part like they that I'm pretty sure they

931.339 --> 935.8800000000001
they made the whole they read they

934.02 --> 937.709
programmed every aspect of the whole

935.88 --> 941.37
series before they started shooting and

937.709 --> 943.5889999999999
this is like yeah you get to see like

941.37 --> 947.36
everything that happens everything that

943.589 --> 951.0790000000001
happens is reveal everything a similar

947.36 --> 953.49
feel to kind of how they did that with

951.079 --> 956.9399999999999
interstellar only that played only a

953.49 --> 958.57
minor role in the situation in the end

956.94 --> 961.7800000000001
it's much more about

958.57 --> 965.44
he's right this isn't at all it's all on

961.78 --> 968.35
earth all of it right so yeah good

965.44 --> 969.94
series once that finished it up now I'm

968.35 --> 972.99
gonna be like ah Christ

969.94 --> 974.8900000000001
it's never fun finishing a good series

972.99 --> 978.22
especially when you realize it's really

974.89 --> 983.79
the end or they would like to have to do

978.22 --> 987.3100000000001
a well a whole new thing from scratch

983.79 --> 989.7099999999999
chords but would it be worth it would it

987.31 --> 991.1199999999999
ever be as good I don't know probably

989.71 --> 994.77
not I don't know what they're thinking

991.12 --> 994.77
about it but it was good

1000.88 --> 1008.11
right so that was yesterday evening on

1005.259 --> 1011.98
this morning watched over the news a

1008.11 --> 1015.389
little and this just crazy [ __ ] going

1011.98 --> 1019.8100000000001
down in the net and it's apparently

1015.389 --> 1023.019
there were farmer protests or they're

1019.81 --> 1025.9589999999998
engaging or something no it's just I

1023.019 --> 1028.059
just touched upon this so I'm not even

1025.959 --> 1030.669
too sure like exactly what has been

1028.059 --> 1035.4089999999999
happening but I know the farmers are

1030.669 --> 1038.14
being like yeah screwed over buyer at

1035.409 --> 1040.409
the government constantly one thing

1038.14 --> 1040.409
after another

1042.78 --> 1051.46
right and now apparently they've

1046.9 --> 1057.01
utilized the army to stop the farmer

1051.46 --> 1063.64
protests like what the [ __ ] just getting

1057.01 --> 1065.35
like really messed up now maybe show

1063.64 --> 1068.909
some pictures like there's like using

1065.35 --> 1068.9089999999999
army vehicles and [ __ ]

1070.52 --> 1082.85
so yeah that's happening apparently all

1077.33 --> 1084.59
right Iren realmedia was also live in

1082.85 --> 1092.09
the morning that was kind of fun being

1084.59 --> 1096.02
there and chat right but before that I

1092.09 --> 1099.83
started drawing right so I've been

1096.02 --> 1103.7
talking about yeah the whole I watched

1099.83 --> 1108.77
back the whole episode yesterday papers

1103.7 --> 1113.14
I watched the whole thing back yesterday

1108.77 --> 1115.7
and yeah unfortunately the whole

1113.14 --> 1117.3500000000001
presuppositional explanation part in the

1115.7 --> 1120.17
custom arch and he wasn't as long as I

1117.35 --> 1122.54
hoped it was compared to the rest but

1120.17 --> 1126.23
still was really interesting and I tried

1122.54 --> 1132.92
to make some drawings to basically back

1126.23 --> 1137.06
up what I had said right several things

1132.92 --> 1141.8300000000002
that I explained in including an attempt

1137.06 --> 1145.31
to show you a a map model conception for

1141.83 --> 1148.58
the same sized ring within and without

1145.31 --> 1151.57
one another system I made it drawn for

1148.58 --> 1156.74
that alright so here first comes the

1151.57 --> 1160.46
irregular looping flat earth which could

1156.74 --> 1163.61
be a flat ball conception but I left

1160.46 --> 1169.76
open if it is basically continuous so

1163.61 --> 1172.04
it's it's knotted up right it's knotted

1169.76 --> 1173.93
up at the North and the South Pole and

1172.04 --> 1175.94
this is the the darker line is

1173.93 --> 1180.5900000000001
supposedly the equator line oh maybe I

1175.94 --> 1183.16
can light this up a little more except

1180.59 --> 1183.1599999999999
make it blurry

1186.59 --> 1194.1299999999999
this is better or worse this is my eyes

1192.51 --> 1196.28
or as the camera are getting it is

1194.13 --> 1199.0200000000002
blurry is weird

1196.28 --> 1203.8999999999999
and I should probably scan this in

1199.02 --> 1208.77
eventually I'll just do it like this so

1203.9 --> 1210.48
see I hope this have I added on the the

1208.77 --> 1213.51
lines which will be an improvised

1210.48 --> 1216.81
version of the latitude and longitude

1213.51 --> 1219.72
lines which are still celestial II

1216.81 --> 1222.0
derived so yeah every aspect of this is

1219.72 --> 1224.4
east to west looping and it's it's

1222.0 --> 1226.59
projected in perfectly straight line so

1224.4 --> 1230.13
this is this part interconnects with

1226.59 --> 1232.1999999999998
that part as if it is one the same goes

1230.13 --> 1234.39
for here so this distance will be

1232.2 --> 1237.1200000000001
shorter so this could be geometrically

1234.39 --> 1239.7800000000002
interpreted as a globe were it not that

1237.12 --> 1243.1999999999998
the whole thing is literally flat

1239.78 --> 1248.04
alright so this is a flat globe

1243.2 --> 1250.5900000000001
conception with room for more space into

1248.04 --> 1253.62
other realms that would be similar or a

1250.59 --> 1257.2099999999998
chain of beads as I described in my very

1253.62 --> 1265.6799999999998
first hangout this is that basically

1257.21 --> 1270.3
right then you got I showed this one to

1265.68 --> 1274.74
Robin Stanley yesterday you got a where

1270.3 --> 1276.99
the equator is an arc so this kind of

1274.74 --> 1279.33
funnily looks almost like an improvised

1276.99 --> 1281.7
children's tree drawing this is how I

1279.33 --> 1284.49
used to draw Christmas trees when I was

1281.7 --> 1289.71
a little kid it's really funny realizing

1284.49 --> 1292.23
that right so this utilizes the same

1289.71 --> 1294.54
projection system for latitude longitude

1292.23 --> 1298.89
lines with the same amount of split up

1294.54 --> 1304.32
of lines it's basically all half in half

1298.89 --> 1306.8000000000002
in half so it's eight parts with

1304.32 --> 1311.6399999999999
latitude in eight parts with longitude

1306.8 --> 1315.72
so here there is an atom mirror image

1311.64 --> 1318.39
there's an atom part this and this is

1315.72 --> 1322.14
actually a barrier but

1318.39 --> 1324.93
yeah because if it would be a semi disk

1322.14 --> 1327.0600000000002
the surface like that and it would

1324.93 --> 1330.93
continue on into other realms well the

1327.06 --> 1336.33
outer part is simply larger that could

1330.93 --> 1339.69
even connect to the literal smaller part

1336.33 --> 1343.56
of the next segment so there would be

1339.69 --> 1346.53
only a minor opening just one segment

1343.56 --> 1350.28
that would open up into the next segment

1346.53 --> 1357.3899999999999
of the the next realm and yeah the rest

1350.28 --> 1359.25
would be impossible to attain now yeah I

1357.39 --> 1361.41
don't even yeah and I've can only

1359.25 --> 1365.04
conceive that there would be a literal

1361.41 --> 1367.0500000000002
barrier there in that case but who knows

1365.04 --> 1368.97
maybe I've even underestimated the

1367.05 --> 1372.2
surreal possibilities of spatial

1368.97 --> 1377.78
interconnection in such a weird setup

1372.2 --> 1384.66
but yeah all right so that's that one

1377.78 --> 1388.8899999999999
and then my masterpiece not really the

1384.66 --> 1392.94
same concept when the equator line is

1388.89 --> 1397.0800000000002
proof on a literal geometrical circle

1392.94 --> 1399.44
within the space it is present in there

1397.08 --> 1399.4399999999998
we go

1403.15 --> 1415.5400000000002
so these ring segments are all the same

1409.12 --> 1418.0
size yet you see the dotted lines the

1415.54 --> 1424.5
outside of one fits in the inside of the

1418.0 --> 1426.91
next and vice versa and they could even

1424.5 --> 1429.79
interlock with one another and then you

1426.91 --> 1432.78
would have like an an impossible puzzle

1429.79 --> 1441.3899999999999
with an Asscher like an azure staircase

1432.78 --> 1444.8799999999999
that could be a reality right with this

1441.39 --> 1451.26
freaking mind-blowing every equator line

1444.88 --> 1455.38
circle in this is a literal same sized

1451.26 --> 1458.5
geometrical circle on the surface all

1455.38 --> 1463.63
literally geometrical circles on the

1458.5 --> 1466.96
same surface sized yet when you travel

1463.63 --> 1473.71
north you end up in another ring the

1466.96 --> 1477.28
exactly the same size there and yeah how

1473.71 --> 1479.41
would that interconnect well it could be

1477.28 --> 1481.36
based on the similar size of the yeah

1479.41 --> 1483.97
the tree version that there would be

1481.36 --> 1486.07
barriers with special places where you

1483.97 --> 1487.78
could transit through I didn't even care

1486.07 --> 1490.95
to draw that in this discuss it was too

1487.78 --> 1496.3899999999999
complicated two draws almost three days

1490.95 --> 1497.95
yeah but it could also be even freaking

1496.39 --> 1500.3200000000002
weirder and this is one that I also

1497.95 --> 1504.429
talked about a little not in the first

1500.32 --> 1507.01
hangout I think where yeah how could you

1504.429 --> 1510.7800000000002
interpret that if one ring would fit

1507.01 --> 1515.98
literally in the next what could be that

1510.78 --> 1519.34
space there simply shrinks so that you

1515.98 --> 1522.79
would unnoticeably move on and literally

1519.34 --> 1525.3
space itself would cause everything to

1522.79 --> 1528.52
become smaller when it goes there so

1525.3 --> 1530.77
space itself may matter the consequence

1528.52 --> 1532.45
of matter size space this is really

1530.77 --> 1533.62
science fiction when I am trying to

1532.45 --> 1536.64
describe I don't even know how to

1533.62 --> 1538.29
explain this is literally space warping

1536.64 --> 1541.0500000000002
so you would go inside and you would

1538.29 --> 1543.57
shrink so you would scale down according

1541.05 --> 1545.3999999999999
so it would from a first from a

1543.57 --> 1549.09
fourth-dimensional perspective you would

1545.4 --> 1553.92
be always in a ring of the same size and

1549.09 --> 1555.6299999999999
would scroll along would just scroll on

1553.92 --> 1558.93
them for you everything would be the

1555.63 --> 1562.5600000000002
same size but from a subjective to the

1558.93 --> 1563.97
realm perspective that could see way too

1562.56 --> 1565.71
forth and it could technically be

1563.97 --> 1570.75
possible you would literally be

1565.71 --> 1573.9
shrinking not by perspective alone but

1570.75 --> 1576.03
literally spatially be shrinking as you

1573.9 --> 1578.73
would be going deeper into the Rings and

1576.03 --> 1580.44
growing larger as you would be going to

1578.73 --> 1582.84
the outer rings from a standstill

1580.44 --> 1584.0700000000002
perspective but from a personal

1582.84 --> 1587.84
perspective a fourth-dimensional

1584.07 --> 1590.85
perspective no it's actually the realm

1587.84 --> 1597.12
that is shrinking and blowing up further

1590.85 --> 1599.6
away from you how are bad for some

1597.12 --> 1599.6
cosmogony

1605.98 --> 1623.06
[Music]

1608.06 --> 1627.1699999999998
Oh Lasky Riesling was a little bit too

1623.06 --> 1629.57
much for your brain you you think it's

1627.17 --> 1630.68
more logical it's a literal geometrical

1629.57 --> 1635.12
sphere even though there's no

1630.68 --> 1638.69
geometrical horizon to be found visually

1635.12 --> 1641.75
which we have to be it's literal 3d

1638.69 --> 1644.1200000000001
globe and the outer space and all that

1641.75 --> 1647.18
you know not making gas pressure on the

1644.12 --> 1649.4299999999998
planet presume planet possible you would

1647.18 --> 1651.3200000000002
rather believe that then that space and

1649.43 --> 1652.78
may not be linear and we may be living

1651.32 --> 1657.6799999999998
in is weird

1652.78 --> 1664.46
yeah spatially fractally fractal wise

1657.68 --> 1667.55
warped 3d reality how about that I think

1664.46 --> 1669.53
that's much more likely like it because

1667.55 --> 1673.07
technically it would all be still

1669.53 --> 1676.09
contained it would all still abide by

1673.07 --> 1679.6399999999999
natural law there's just certain weird

1676.09 --> 1685.28
speciality aspects and hey might have

1679.64 --> 1688.0
taken out his space space reality it

1685.28 --> 1691.1299999999999
kind of falls into geometry rather than

1688.0 --> 1695.32
science and even physics you can even

1691.13 --> 1702.74
use it to prove something scientifically

1695.32 --> 1707.4399999999998
space a length a distance you know so

1702.74 --> 1712.52
yeah does it make it impossible though

1707.44 --> 1715.3700000000001
now breaking natural law that does make

1712.52 --> 1719.24
it impossible so everything that I've

1715.37 --> 1725.56
shared here is actually potentially

1719.24 --> 1725.56
possible while the globe is not

1745.99 --> 1752.96
right hmm so yeah I hope you guys all

1750.47 --> 1759.1100000000001
appreciate that presentation little

1752.96 --> 1761.8890000000001
thingy I liked it it's good to do some

1759.11 --> 1761.889
homework again

1774.169 --> 1777.5490000000002
what are you talking about

1782.759 --> 1790.41
inside a sphere no you're not inside a

1785.399 --> 1793.609
sphere there is no sphere

1790.41 --> 1793.6090000000002
[Music]

1817.01 --> 1823.34
there aren't four dimensions who knows

1820.1 --> 1829.34
no fourth time at the fourth dimension

1823.34 --> 1832.48
is only a concept but I think it is at

1829.34 --> 1841.1599999999999
least a little bit more viable than

1832.48 --> 1844.13
Einsteins concept you know I'm not

1841.16 --> 1847.88
trying to read I'm not trying to change

1844.13 --> 1852.17
time into a spatial element in any way

1847.88 --> 1854.2700000000002
with like inconclusive output of what

1852.17 --> 1856.18
that even does you know that's not what

1854.27 --> 1861.17
I'm doing here no no no I'm simply

1856.18 --> 1865.13
presupposing certain space flexibility

1861.17 --> 1868.0700000000002
situations to be an entrance point of

1865.13 --> 1871.99
approach of the situation and then

1868.07 --> 1871.99
seeing what could it be

1879.12 --> 1882.2099999999998
[Music]

1885.9 --> 1892.74
as above so below images also explains

1888.9 --> 1895.17
looping you mean it could be explained

1892.74 --> 1898.14
through the concept of looping be

1895.17 --> 1898.91
careful and how you say that but yeah I

1898.14 --> 1901.68
agree

1898.91 --> 1904.98
look there's a lot of the most ancient

1901.68 --> 1907.68
depictions they can be really weird and

1904.98 --> 1910.95
surreal and they are just like that

1907.68 --> 1913.8300000000002
showing yeah

1910.95 --> 1917.16
spatial irregularities with the surfaces

1913.83 --> 1923.82
and things and they warp the space in

1917.16 --> 1926.7900000000002
depictions I think especially like in

1923.82 --> 1931.11
the Hindu it areas and all that and and

1926.79 --> 1934.53
yeah even like the the ring situation

1931.11 --> 1939.059
that I showed well in a way I even got

1934.53 --> 1945.96
that idea I think from things that I've

1939.059 --> 1949.74
seen what is it what they do the

1945.96 --> 1951.57
mandalas where they draw the Rings and

1949.74 --> 1953.46
there's like these drunks where they

1951.57 --> 1957.6
literally like people in there in the

1953.46 --> 1959.04
ring and then there's other things in

1957.6 --> 1962.6699999999998
the next ring and other things in the

1959.04 --> 1964.53
next ring and yeah that you know they're

1962.67 --> 1971.4
not interconnecting rings they are like

1964.53 --> 1977.059
really separated so maybe that is a way

1971.4 --> 1977.0590000000002
they are trying to depict this concept

1978.5 --> 1982.97
like this doesn't really matter

1983.7 --> 1993.5800000000002
right so yeah technically I didn't even

1989.71 --> 1996.19
think of it completely myself but I it's

1993.58 --> 1997.75
not like somebody told this to me I just

1996.19 --> 2001.7
got to see things and then I was like

1997.75 --> 2004.61
what is this and then everybody's also

2001.7 --> 2007.31
symbolic older just trying to put down

2004.61 --> 2011.31
historical things in a certain

2007.31 --> 2013.95
representation way and well that's the

2011.31 --> 2016.11
ages air-blast ages as the years has

2013.95 --> 2020.76
passed I'm starting to think what some

2016.11 --> 2024.12
of these things like but maybe they

2020.76 --> 2030.36
weren't doing that maybe they meant

2024.12 --> 2032.6699999999998
something else maybe there is some

2030.36 --> 2036.09
speciality aspect they were trying to

2032.67 --> 2038.25
explain so if that isn't blatantly

2036.09 --> 2040.9199999999998
obvious then why would that be could it

2038.25 --> 2049.56
be because it is really difficult to

2040.92 --> 2051.659
explain in a depiction right oh it's

2049.56 --> 2054.96
already taking a quite a lot of effort

2051.659 --> 2059.659
for me to explain the concept with a

2054.96 --> 2059.659
very flexible language called English

2060.71 --> 2066.75
and that's with spoken language and

2063.929 --> 2069.51
pictures and describing skim and X

2066.75 --> 2072.169
well that's that's not around in yeah

2069.51 --> 2076.23
and these ancient books not like that

2072.169 --> 2079.4089999999997
there's no design modeling pictures like

2076.23 --> 2085.23
that no there's just like iconography

2079.409 --> 2087.87
big prints with very detailed concepts

2085.23 --> 2090.389
and it's like even a big mystery it's

2087.87 --> 2092.85
like just they have to just do it like

2090.389 --> 2094.35
that and I don't know even if all the

2092.85 --> 2096.36
people that make those things know

2094.35 --> 2098.88
exactly what it represents but it's like

2096.36 --> 2101.34
just an art and it's just not they do

2098.88 --> 2104.78
have to do it exactly like that and so

2101.34 --> 2104.78
that's how they do it for generations

2105.02 --> 2109.35
something in that direction you know

2107.16 --> 2112.1099999999997
they don't necessarily have to know have

2109.35 --> 2116.43
the full insight you know you don't have

2112.11 --> 2118.589
to be told what something is

2116.43 --> 2121.1699999999996
in order for next generation to

2118.589 --> 2126.359
reproduce it they just have to know how

2121.17 --> 2129.75
to reprobated difficult to get the next

2126.359 --> 2131.4
generation every time to get them to

2129.75 --> 2134.91
understand it maybe that is more

2131.4 --> 2137.1600000000003
sporadic that people actually arise in a

2134.91 --> 2139.44
certain moment of time where they do get

2137.16 --> 2144.29
the inside of something like this maybe

2139.44 --> 2144.29
that is much rarer ever considered that

2158.24 --> 2166.3399999999997
well a craft can be practiced and

2162.69 --> 2169.89
repeated and things can be memorized and

2166.34 --> 2176.28
continued and reproduced but wisdom

2169.89 --> 2179.0699999999997
cannot be automated you can't force a

2176.28 --> 2182.0400000000004
person to understand something or to let

2179.07 --> 2186.81
go of an OLE idea you can try to make

2182.04 --> 2189.69
them but it's not as predictable as

2186.81 --> 2194.5499999999997
basically just teaching a person a craft

2189.69 --> 2199.53
and because yeah that's not so much

2194.55 --> 2201.27
about the about the meaning of things

2199.53 --> 2213.9500000000003
you know it's just something you're

2201.27 --> 2216.98
reproducing right what I mean by no

2213.95 --> 2220.02
geometrical horizon is no sphere

2216.98 --> 2224.45
geometric geometric or horizon tiny

2220.02 --> 2228.78
wubble there is no geometrical horizon

2224.45 --> 2232.52
because that specific geometrical

2228.78 --> 2235.2000000000003
horizon mentioned is a globe based

2232.52 --> 2239.22
geometrical horizon which has certain

2235.2 --> 2240.8689999999997
necessities if yeah if you presuppose

2239.22 --> 2246.66
it's there then it has to abide by

2240.869 --> 2249.4700000000003
certain things and yeah it's already

2246.66 --> 2252.93
widely admitted there is no visible

2249.47 --> 2256.5
geometrical horizon and thereby admitted

2252.93 --> 2258.45
because of what a horizon really is and

2256.5 --> 2261.619
how it works that there is no

2258.45 --> 2265.1699999999996
geometrical horizon because a horizon

2261.619 --> 2268.6800000000003
can never be visually displaced above

2265.17 --> 2272.099
the horizon that's impossible the

2268.68 --> 2277.14
horizon is always where it is doesn't

2272.099 --> 2279.63
change height it may appear closer it

2277.14 --> 2284.19
may appear farther away line-of-sight

2279.63 --> 2289.44
may draw closer blur up closer clear up

2284.19 --> 2295.2000000000003
blur up farther away but the horizon

2289.44 --> 2301.53
it doesn't really change height might be

2295.2 --> 2305.8799999999997
just inches nudged pixels nudged through

2301.53 --> 2310.38
some yeah unusual actual refraction

2305.88 --> 2314.1600000000003
situation but it's not really yeah it's

2310.38 --> 2317.599
not displaced above some other place

2314.16 --> 2320.94
that's impossible only things

2317.599 --> 2323.9700000000003
surrounding the horizon can be displaced

2320.94 --> 2327.06
the horizon itself cannot so with the

2323.97 --> 2330.47
claim of a geometrical horizon not being

2327.06 --> 2334.65
visible because it is being illumine the

2330.47 --> 2338.43
apparent horizon is a concession that

2334.65 --> 2341.9900000000002
there is no geometrical horizon it

2338.43 --> 2341.99
technically is exactly that

2344.98 --> 2348.11
[Music]

2367.48 --> 2371.52
parent horizon changes height

2372.52 --> 2385.5099999999998
it doesn't it just draws closer or

2377.859 --> 2388.47
further doesn't change height draws

2385.51 --> 2388.4700000000003
closer or further

2392.8 --> 2398.75
it's just things that objects

2396.41 --> 2403.609
surrounding the apparent the visual

2398.75 --> 2417.77
horizon the horizon they may appear to

2403.609 --> 2421.7
change height the horizon does not only

2417.77 --> 2425.77
draws closer or moves further away

2421.7 --> 2428.6899999999996
visually doesn't change height objects

2425.77 --> 2434.38
surrounding the horizon change height

2428.69 --> 2434.38
perhaps the horizon does not

2464.32 --> 2467.53
[Music]

2475.24 --> 2484.68
why is something before the platform and

2478.15 --> 2489.7000000000003
something behind it cuz you see it there

2484.68 --> 2494.5589999999997
but yet the horizon is not before the

2489.7 --> 2497.5
platform its behind it and if it were

2494.559 --> 2500.05
before it it would be because the

2497.5 --> 2502.78
observer height conditions or the

2500.05 --> 2505.21
weather conditions would alter so that

2502.78 --> 2510.8390000000004
your risin as I said would appear closer

2505.21 --> 2514.51
by not higher or lower no closer why and

2510.839 --> 2518.41
objects behind it they may appear to be

2514.51 --> 2521.23
lower or higher horizon is it it's the

2518.41 --> 2524.0099999999998
same height it's just further away

2521.23 --> 2524.01
closer by

2550.89 --> 2554.0099999999998
[Music]

2558.97 --> 2566.1699999999996
[Music]

2570.52 --> 2576.96
alright Lasky Riesling I just said in

2573.85 --> 2580.5099999999998
another image the horizon will move

2576.96 --> 2583.45
closer by perhaps then it would appear

2580.51 --> 2587.8900000000003
like the horizon is blocking off the

2583.45 --> 2592.4199999999996
other platform right well it's because

2587.89 --> 2596.98
the horizon has moved closer because of

2592.42 --> 2600.119
conditions it's not the horizon itself

2596.98 --> 2600.119
hasn't changed height

2605.0 --> 2610.04
you know the D suppose original Black

2607.76 --> 2613.2200000000003
Swan photograph what's so remarkable

2610.04 --> 2617.09
about it is that the horizon D well the

2613.22 --> 2619.3399999999997
real sizable optical slant point is so

2617.09 --> 2621.8
insanely far away that's really the

2619.34 --> 2624.6800000000003
unusual part because it's much more

2621.8 --> 2629.21
logical that the horizon would be all in

2624.68 --> 2631.6699999999996
between would still would make it a ball

2629.21 --> 2633.95
in any circumstance it's really unusual

2631.67 --> 2636.2000000000003
that the optical slant just for some

2633.95 --> 2638.0899999999997
reason seems to be very far away it

2636.2 --> 2641.5699999999997
reminds me of the shot that Randy took

2638.09 --> 2644.38
one time with with his skin with the

2641.57 --> 2646.8500000000004
camera in the water half like that and

2644.38 --> 2648.38
then he's you saw the beach like on the

2646.85 --> 2651.23
other side while the lens was just the

2648.38 --> 2654.4100000000003
same height as the water that is also

2651.23 --> 2657.73
like a really bizarre extreme far away

2654.41 --> 2657.73
optical slant scenario

2662.27 --> 2665.389
[Music]

2677.339 --> 2683.339
sauce from the food changed the horizon

2680.91 --> 2686.219
in a pig yes absolutely of course where

2683.339 --> 2689.8089999999997
the wet water is going to be any title

2686.219 --> 2693.4790000000003
bulging happening because of tides

2689.809 --> 2696.4500000000003
yeah sure that could change the the

2693.479 --> 2703.9199999999996
apparent cutoff point it could basically

2696.45 --> 2706.4399999999996
create a local geometria oceanic horizon

2703.92 --> 2709.529
like a local geometrical horizon caused

2706.44 --> 2713.94
by a water bulge that happens to stake

2709.529 --> 2716.19
out and blocks off a lot because of

2713.94 --> 2717.509
perspective because it's closer by then

2716.19 --> 2720.93
the things that are much further away so

2717.509 --> 2724.68
that scales up the small amount of

2720.93 --> 2727.5789999999997
height difference and blocks a lot in

2724.68 --> 2727.5789999999997
very far away

2744.76 --> 2749.86
why do I think platforms can change a

2747.7 --> 2752.0499999999997
parent position but the horizon can't

2749.86 --> 2755.2000000000003
well that's because that's how

2752.05 --> 2757.03
refraction is proven to work you

2755.2 --> 2761.02
actually look up the effects of

2757.03 --> 2763.11
refraction there's four of them once

2761.02 --> 2763.11
again

2764.91 --> 2775.12
looming falling stooping towering right

2772.48 --> 2778.42
all these effects are always in relation

2775.12 --> 2783.54
to sment in relays specifically now that

2778.42 --> 2787.84
in relation to the horizon there is no

2783.54 --> 2793.69
refraction that exists that displaces

2787.84 --> 2796.8700000000003
the horizon doesn't exist because it is

2793.69 --> 2799.27
always the whole effect is in relation

2796.87 --> 2802.14
to the horizon so there's never any

2799.27 --> 2806.29
displacement of the horizon itself

2802.14 --> 2809.2599999999998
unless there is a physical height change

2806.29 --> 2812.47
happening like for example the tidal

2809.26 --> 2814.6000000000004
bulge is literally an extra bit of water

2812.47 --> 2817.77
on top of there that's literal the

2814.6 --> 2817.77
physical add on

2821.27 --> 2826.25
like that's not caused because of

2823.7 --> 2829.93
refraction it's because there is little

2826.25 --> 2829.93
something in the way there

2830.68 --> 2833.7999999999997
[Music]

2837.34 --> 2844.9
of course The Horizon changes I never

2841.87 --> 2848.8599999999997
said it didn't change what I said is it

2844.9 --> 2852.31
doesn't displace up or down it moves

2848.86 --> 2855.51
further away or closer by that's what it

2852.31 --> 2855.5099999999998
does it doesn't change height

2865.77 --> 2872.82
yeah how could I compare it if you just

2870.78 --> 2877.8
yeah kind of like the eyeball on the

2872.82 --> 2881.28
stake effects right let's do this right

2877.8 --> 2883.44
so you see things into the distance then

2881.28 --> 2886.2900000000004
you get the horizon where the sky meets

2883.44 --> 2888.36
the ground and then it pretty much folds

2886.29 --> 2891.36
in there and moves beyond and yeah you

2888.36 --> 2893.94
will see things getting concealed

2891.36 --> 2895.619
because of behind their optical stunts

2893.94 --> 2905.27
the tying point where the sky meets the

2895.619 --> 2909.21
ground right was I gonna say right so if

2905.27 --> 2912.0
refraction would cause the line-of-sight

2909.21 --> 2914.01
to blur up the optical slant point to

2912.0 --> 2915.42
become closer by in this case not

2914.01 --> 2917.07
because of high change but because of

2915.42 --> 2920.25
air clarity whatever

2917.07 --> 2925.1400000000003
yeah then this point it's tying point is

2920.25 --> 2931.109
not point maybe basically move closer it

2925.14 --> 2934.92
will be folded in there the height is

2931.109 --> 2939.0299999999997
not changing the horizon is simply

2934.92 --> 2942.92
moving closer by instead of farther away

2939.03 --> 2946.07
you get it now

2942.92 --> 2946.07
[Music]

2951.52 --> 2954.61
[Music]

2964.56 --> 2974.47
just show my I'll show you my eyeball on

2967.96 --> 2978.4900000000002
a stick again I guess to support what I

2974.47 --> 2985.95
just said oh that's fun

2978.49 --> 2989.2299999999996
ooh oh yeah I'm gonna show this one too

2985.95 --> 2991.7799999999997
yeah that that's funny I bumped you into

2989.23 --> 2994.9
a drawing that's kind of an something

2991.78 --> 2999.3
that I even tried to model this is an

2994.9 --> 2999.3
older drawing huh forgot I had that

3007.17 --> 3017.13
hmm go on yeah that's right

3013.02 --> 3017.13
all right look at that what I found

3021.64 --> 3038.1299999999997
this is very similar to this except this

3031.779 --> 3042.88
is a top-down projection and this is a

3038.13 --> 3044.8900000000003
angled perspective for ya visual

3042.88 --> 3047.17
projection without all the latitude

3044.89 --> 3051.749
lines and all that and longitude but I

3047.17 --> 3051.7490000000003
did draw like a D or a segment in there

3052.92 --> 3061.529
funny isn't it right so but it was

3056.079 --> 3071.009
actually going to show you this one

3061.529 --> 3074.009
eyeball on a stick come on why are you

3071.009 --> 3074.009
alright

3082.73 --> 3091.91
so I just described this eyeball on a

3087.26 --> 3096.8300000000004
stick it folds into within the field of

3091.91 --> 3098.8399999999997
view like that like a tube and then at

3096.83 --> 3101.54
some point there is an optical slant

3098.84 --> 3103.88
it's caused by diffraction that fraction

3101.54 --> 3105.98
limit Raley's criteria all that the

3103.88 --> 3110.21
combined preponderance of the optics

3105.98 --> 3110.9
effects causes it demonstrable to

3110.21 --> 3113.7200000000003
yourself

3110.9 --> 3115.7000000000003
everybody can test that it is there it

3113.72 --> 3118.1899999999996
has to do with observer ID and the air

3115.7 --> 3120.6499999999996
clarity and after that point there is

3118.19 --> 3127.7000000000003
mirages in effect so there is looming

3120.65 --> 3129.65
stooping towering is the other one you

3127.7 --> 3131.54
know what I mean anyway and there yeah

3129.65 --> 3137.9
beyond the optical slant point things

3131.54 --> 3141.14
are basically concealed by the optical

3137.9 --> 3144.17
slant in a linear relation over distance

3141.14 --> 3147.92
and then eventually yeah that ends up in

3144.17 --> 3150.65
the ends we're simply refraction makes

3147.92 --> 3153.92
things blur up so much that you only

3150.65 --> 3155.6600000000003
have a generic background color and

3153.92 --> 3158.69
that's all you can see even if there was

3155.66 --> 3161.8999999999996
an object that was huge like a mountain

3158.69 --> 3164.18
of 100 kilometers high after that point

3161.9 --> 3168.44
you would not see it it would be

3164.18 --> 3170.8399999999997
invisible it would be covered up by the

3168.44 --> 3172.76
blur up of the generalized color of

3170.84 --> 3176.9300000000003
everything that's around it until you

3172.76 --> 3179.9
just it just reaches that area and then

3176.93 --> 3182.359
it will literally start to blur like a

3179.9 --> 3185.1800000000003
mirage manifesting it was literally

3182.359 --> 3190.369
started to blur through the backdrop and

3185.18 --> 3193.8199999999997
suddenly pop out of nowhere that's what

3190.369 --> 3198.19
it would be like I'm pretty certain of

3193.82 --> 3201.26
this I'd love to see somebody actually

3198.19 --> 3203.78
managing to get that caught on camera on

3201.26 --> 3205.9300000000003
some kind of travel maybe in a boat or

3203.78 --> 3210.01
something it's like if there was a

3205.93 --> 3210.0099999999998
massive mountain somewhere

3211.17 --> 3219.09
at sea that would be real but it would

3216.21 --> 3223.11
have to be insanely colossal to

3219.09 --> 3225.75
literally be still large enough to pick

3223.11 --> 3227.6400000000003
up resolution wise when it is

3225.75 --> 3231.24
technically going to be out of

3227.64 --> 3233.52
refraction sights after the blur you

3231.24 --> 3236.04
have to do yeah so is there even a place

3233.52 --> 3240.02
on this world where there's a big enough

3236.04 --> 3243.23
thing for you to test such an effect

3240.02 --> 3243.23
right now

3246.31 --> 3249.489
[Music]

3264.21 --> 3271.32
that's right horizon may move closer or

3267.55 --> 3271.32
further away does not change hiked

3287.289 --> 3294.619
platforms don't change position you do

3290.679 --> 3296.449
well position look the platforms that

3294.619 --> 3299.2090000000003
you get to see are basically in an

3296.449 --> 3301.579
apparent position in relation to the

3299.209 --> 3305.989
horizon because of well it's very far

3301.579 --> 3309.409
away and the effects happen we'll make

3305.989 --> 3311.449
it we'll make it happen to visually

3309.409 --> 3314.9590000000003
distort in some way perhaps displaced

3311.449 --> 3319.849
perhaps stretch up or whatever in

3314.959 --> 3322.959
relation to the horizon but of course

3319.849 --> 3327.799
the literal platforms don't change

3322.959 --> 3330.459
physical position but the visuals that

3327.799 --> 3334.159
you pick up of them can be displaced

3330.459 --> 3337.7889999999998
because of refraction effects but that

3334.159 --> 3346.849
displacement would always be in relation

3337.789 --> 3348.8900000000003
to the fixed height of the horizon maybe

3346.849 --> 3352.039
I could even state that I'm gonna test

3348.89 --> 3357.339
that I'm gonna cross-reference this with

3352.039 --> 3363.039
what QE is the height of the horizon

3357.339 --> 3363.0389999999998
fixed I'm gonna test this

3365.94 --> 3371.91
you know because I might yeah I've been

3368.97 --> 3373.799
saying this now in this hangout but now

3371.91 --> 3377.46
I'm thinking but I'm not even a hundred

3373.799 --> 3380.94
percent sure it but like yeah it's you

3377.46 --> 3384.0
know it's an apparent thing so it might

3380.94 --> 3389.549
appear to change hi no no I am right

3384.0 --> 3392.76
because like in a in an angular way it

3389.549 --> 3397.89
may seem the visual hedge as it were of

3392.76 --> 3402.63
a horizon may seem to change height but

3397.89 --> 3405.1189999999997
like if you would actually pinpoint the

3402.63 --> 3409.5
object that is part of that visual of

3405.119 --> 3411.96
the horizon then it wouldn't it would

3409.5 --> 3415.289
simply be a matter of perspective and

3411.96 --> 3425.099
when things get closer by angular wise

3415.289 --> 3425.8190000000004
they drop down see so yeah that's a

3425.099 --> 3428.88
tough one

3425.819 --> 3431.0
it's almost like yeah we're we're both

3428.88 --> 3434.849
correct we're both wrong

3431.0 --> 3440.4
this is a tough one but I think that I

3434.849 --> 3442.079
technically was correct platforms do not

3440.4 --> 3446.69
change well their literal position do

3442.079 --> 3450.119
not change but any visuals of them at a

3446.69 --> 3452.91
horizon however it's working at the

3450.119 --> 3456.4700000000003
moment they can be displaced but the

3452.91 --> 3456.47
literal positions of them do not

3459.69 --> 3465.869
mmm right so I'm gonna round out the

3463.289 --> 3472.38
show hi it's almost full flat earther

3465.869 --> 3474.4500000000003
how about that ah so thanks everyone for

3472.38 --> 3476.9100000000003
coming I hope you liked this show I

3474.45 --> 3478.3799999999997
thought it was pretty damn good so if

3476.91 --> 3480.1189999999997
you did then please don't forget to

3478.38 --> 3481.77
Rogen's it up and if you haven't already

3480.119 --> 3483.299
subscribed to my channel and hit the

3481.77 --> 3485.28
bell notification so you know when I'm

3483.299 --> 3487.44
going live which is normally 2 p.m.

3485.28 --> 3489.599
after damn time every day and please

3487.44 --> 3491.579
also do support me through paypal

3489.599 --> 3494.19
patreon the super chat and the

3491.579 --> 3500.28
membership system join button we much

3494.19 --> 3502.77
appreciate it we'll use it right I will

3500.28 --> 3506.13
be back tomorrow the Saturday edition of

3502.77 --> 3508.95
the Flat Earth early birds number 588

3506.13 --> 3510.869
and I'm gonna join the Flat Earth debate

3508.95 --> 3518.9399999999996
right after this it should start up any

3510.869 --> 3524.1600000000003
minute now see ashtec meifa indeed Steve

3518.94 --> 3528.44
over Marco and right until the next

3524.16 --> 3528.44
video keep it flat

3528.78 --> 3551.7090000000003
[Music]

3554.9 --> 3556.96
