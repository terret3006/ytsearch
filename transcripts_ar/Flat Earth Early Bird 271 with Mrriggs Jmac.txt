6.31 --> 39.88
[Music]

36.21 --> 43.51
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

39.88 --> 45.010000000000005
early-bird number 271 I'm your host

43.51 --> 46.78
Arwen and before we start the show

45.01 --> 48.61
please don't forget to share it on any

46.78 --> 49.93
platform you deem fit and also if you

48.61 --> 51.64
haven't already subscribed to my channel

49.93 --> 53.32
and hit the bell notification so you

51.64 --> 55.6
know when I'm going live which is

53.32 --> 58.3
normally 2:00 p.m. Amsterdam time every

55.6 --> 60.309
day so please also support my channel

58.3 --> 63.16
through the super chats paypal my

60.309 --> 65.97
patreon and my GoFundMe of course much

63.16 --> 73.09
obliged by the way I did get another

65.97 --> 78.82
GoFundMe contribution somewhere yeah

73.09 --> 80.47
last night I think from Brenda my alley

78.82 --> 84.1
I don't know who that is

80.47 --> 86.95
so another Brenda with a comment can't

84.1 --> 87.94
wait for Arwen to get to do some field

86.95 --> 92.26
work Cheers

87.94 --> 97.96
$10 Thanks so thank you for that support

92.26 --> 102.07000000000001
always good to see that going up alright

97.96 --> 105.69999999999999
so let's see the weather today it's kind

102.07 --> 108.61
of nice hasn't really rained yet still

105.7 --> 114.46000000000001
cloudy here and there but also moments

108.61 --> 117.67
of nice some wind still going but not

114.46 --> 121.57
constantly now now that's not as heavy

117.67 --> 123.81
as yesterday but still going on just a

121.57 --> 123.80999999999999
nice day

127.26 --> 136.19
all right so good to see there's some

131.25 --> 139.85
people in early because I'm early

136.19 --> 142.47
so yeah hm dank righteous force

139.85 --> 149.64
Emmerich's j-mac and and the many young

142.47 --> 159.98
and Steve good to see you na Fyodor

149.64 --> 159.98
Dostoevsky I got to see you all I'm

161.72 --> 169.38
enough in a weird mood because as

166.2 --> 178.5
everybody in the whole freaking world by

169.38 --> 181.23
now knows yeah the the deep state man

178.5 --> 183.69
are these the secret guy Epstein was

181.23 --> 186.95999999999998
found dead in his cell and the

183.69 --> 189.48
conspiracy is born immediately because

186.96 --> 191.82000000000002
it was not supposed to be able to do

189.48 --> 198.57
that the whole setup was so incredibly

191.82 --> 202.76999999999998
tricky and this could get very

198.57 --> 205.65
complicated so now everybody's pondering

202.77 --> 210.15
on that and I was just watching Owen

205.65 --> 212.52
Benjamin from last night and he was made

210.15 --> 217.44
that made a lot of sense though I don't

212.52 --> 222.54000000000002
agree with everything about it but

217.44 --> 227.25
that's keeping me busy and it's weird

222.54 --> 229.5
because concerning all of this I've seen

227.25 --> 233.82
a lot of dark world vision stuff

229.5 --> 235.98
relating to just a lot of people in

233.82 --> 240.45
general some of which I haven't even

235.98 --> 243.23899999999998
seen yet and it's just very weird to see

240.45 --> 248.36999999999998
it play out like that because I did

243.239 --> 251.76
expect it it's weird

248.37 --> 255.18
it's it every draws like a misplaced

251.76 --> 257.78999999999996
type of empathy out of me like I felt

255.18 --> 260.699
kind of sad for the guy being let yeah

257.79 --> 263.28000000000003
being stuck left in that place with

260.699 --> 266.55
pretty much nowhere to go but I

263.28 --> 271.53
shouldn't be of course or should i I

266.55 --> 280.88
don't know wherever he goes he will

271.53 --> 283.77
deserve it just maybe my empathy is just

280.88 --> 287.52
too good yeah too strong for my own good

283.77 --> 291.12
and I can just feel how extremely

287.52 --> 293.35999999999996
uncomfortable that must be I shouldn't

291.12 --> 296.07
you know I should just leave him there

293.36 --> 297.08000000000004
with his feelings because that is what

296.07 --> 302.94
he asked for

297.08 --> 308.25
with everything that he did yeah I know

302.94 --> 310.889
it just gives me the creeps to to to

308.25 --> 316.28
feel where where some people have let

310.889 --> 316.28000000000003
themselves go it's so surreal to me

321.639 --> 328.01
so anyway that's been on my mind a bit

324.5 --> 331.04
also looking through yeah mostly

328.01 --> 333.32
skipping through the faman lectures

331.04 --> 336.29
because I figured out okay those first

333.32 --> 340.46
two books literally all just

336.29 --> 345.199
mathematical extrapolations and busy

340.46 --> 351.94899999999996
therapy for math holics so I decided to

345.199 --> 359.81
delve straight in to the third book let

351.949 --> 361.43
me share some of that let's see alright

359.81 --> 364.76
he always likes to start out with like

361.43 --> 368.99
these the original the photograph boards

364.76 --> 373.34
of his stuff anyway I'm looking through

368.99 --> 375.68
it and I'm already finding issues like

373.34 --> 378.26
pretty much in the first sentence and

375.68 --> 381.35
the second one here I just wanted to

378.26 --> 383.599
share my thoughts on that and maybe I

381.35 --> 386.99
might do this a little bit more often

383.599 --> 390.229
like even live read it untouched and

386.99 --> 393.639
just give my instant response to it so

390.229 --> 396.40999999999997
let me read out this this entire part

393.639 --> 398.81
Newton thought that light was made up of

396.41 --> 401.41900000000004
particles but then it was discovered

398.81 --> 403.61
that it behaved behaves like a wave

401.419 --> 405.94
later however in the beginning of the

403.61 --> 408.86
20th century it was found that light did

405.94 --> 411.979
indeed sometimes behave like a particle

408.86 --> 415.40000000000003
or really historically the electron for

411.979 --> 417.05
example this is weird that it switched

415.4 --> 419.75
from light and then historically

417.05 --> 422.599
electron right I don't know that

419.75 --> 425.24
electron and light was not exactly the

422.599 --> 427.15999999999997
same but oh well was thought to behave

425.24 --> 429.169
like a particle and then it was found

427.16 --> 434.11
that in many respects it behaved like a

429.169 --> 434.10999999999996
wave so it really behaves like neither

434.83 --> 443.919
now we have given up it's like neither

439.82 --> 443.919
well that's definitely

444.13 --> 454.35
a very weird conclusion so if they found

450.52 --> 457.65
that certain typical behavioral types

454.35 --> 461.02000000000004
that we recognize and can compare to

457.65 --> 463.51
more large-scale things more close to

461.02 --> 465.43
our own observation range that there are

463.51 --> 468.03999999999996
certain patterns that we can compare

465.43 --> 471.48
behavior to in the material world to the

468.04 --> 474.91
micro world and they've figured out that

471.48 --> 481.26
well sometimes it's like this sometimes

474.91 --> 481.26000000000005
it's like that so it can be neither why

483.12 --> 496.44
why can't it do that well maybe now I'm

493.42 --> 496.44
losing the point here

501.62 --> 507.5
it's you know beside doing this looking

505.7 --> 510.38
into the and immediately bumping into

507.5 --> 512.09
this just as an obstacle I started to

510.38 --> 514.6899999999999
look around on YouTube for a bit

512.09 --> 518.45
just to find some kind of actual

514.69 --> 521.45
double-slit experiment that is an actual

518.45 --> 524.9300000000001
experiment and I couldn't find it almost

521.45 --> 527.4200000000001
the vast majority was either lectures by

524.93 --> 530.93
quantum mechanics that explain it or

527.42 --> 537.3199999999999
were 3d animations explaining how it

530.93 --> 539.81
supposedly works or we're basically like

537.32 --> 542.1800000000001
oh yeah here a machine and then people

539.81 --> 547.39
talking how that is supposed to be doing

542.18 --> 550.66
that so I've never seen anything

547.39 --> 553.34
actually demonstrating the effect

550.66 --> 560.0799999999999
actually demonstrating it never seen it

553.34 --> 560.08
very frustrating

567.78 --> 571.8299999999999
because I'm just starting to get the

569.94 --> 578.49
feeling like the whole thing is a giant

571.83 --> 582.6
myth it's a micro world science-based

578.49 --> 585.78
folk lore it seems because everybody

582.6 --> 588.33
gets out supposed to be working sort of

585.78 --> 590.91
when they finally get it at least it's

588.33 --> 595.5
it's repeatable I've never seen the

590.91 --> 601.14
actual demonstration and it's bizarre

595.5 --> 604.95
because every time somebody tries to

601.14 --> 608.76
prove it they find that it's so hard to

604.95 --> 611.85
do so it has the Cavendish setup effect

608.76 --> 614.64
and grained within it an actual

611.85 --> 617.25
experiment should be extremely simple to

614.64 --> 619.98
demonstrate you should be able to just

617.25 --> 624.09
get some things together and do it bang

619.98 --> 627.9
before after a bang there you go well

624.09 --> 633.089
with this thing it's apparently absurdly

627.9 --> 635.97
complex otherwise I have YouTube full of

633.089 --> 638.25
yeah live demonstrations of how that's

635.97 --> 642.87
supposed to work and I haven't seen it

638.25 --> 644.94
and it's almost like losing Santa Claus

642.87 --> 647.37
all over again because I thought it was

644.94 --> 649.85
a really cool concept but now there's

647.37 --> 654.2
not just there's nothing out there

649.85 --> 654.2
to actually prove it's real

659.88 --> 673.96
hmm so but I will keep on digging even

667.69 --> 676.72
if just to see how this machination that

673.96 --> 684.22
it could turn out to be that seems to be

676.72 --> 686.95
so far how they built it and why why

684.22 --> 696.52
it's built the way it is how that came

686.95 --> 699.01
to be let's see if I find something

696.52 --> 703.4499999999999
interesting on that line it's kind of

699.01 --> 706.27
silly but then again I I pulled this up

703.45 --> 710.58
it was like a half hour before the show

706.27 --> 710.5799999999999
started and then I got impatient

716.04 --> 724.38
it's also weird because he said here

719.19 --> 727.6700000000001
that he was basically defaulting

724.38 --> 730.71
something saying that in the micro world

727.67 --> 732.9
nothing behaves like anything we can

730.71 --> 739.11
compare it it the unpredictability

732.9 --> 740.91
factor is apparently so vast that you

739.11 --> 746.4
can't compare it with any kind of

740.91 --> 750.36
process that we see in a natural

746.4 --> 752.49
behavior of matter according to him it's

750.36 --> 754.76
just so weird about putting it in the

752.49 --> 754.76
vague

766.8 --> 769.64
hmm

769.66 --> 777.4599999999999
now that's fascinating cept happy it's a

773.23 --> 780.22
good question how is cold like created

777.46 --> 784.48
if the moonlight is supposedly cold well

780.22 --> 786.94
as I am now kind of stuck in quantum

784.48 --> 789.5500000000001
mechanics I'm going to immediately

786.94 --> 790.69
entertain that concept and speculate the

789.55 --> 793.4799999999999
crap out of it

790.69 --> 802.98
and say what if the moonlight for

793.48 --> 806.89
example somehow applies a certain

802.98 --> 812.41
frequency to matter that is exposed to

806.89 --> 819.43
it and when absorbed it literally causes

812.41 --> 822.4599999999999
heat to transfer more quickly so to get

819.43 --> 826.81
out of the way not to heat up but to

822.46 --> 829.45
somehow change the the frequency a

826.81 --> 833.05
little adapted a little so that heat may

829.45 --> 836.59
transfer more quickly so that it'll

833.05 --> 840.4
hasten the transfer of heat now that in

836.59 --> 843.58
a nighttime situation would generally

840.4 --> 845.65
result in heat transferring from the

843.58 --> 848.5
place where it's leading the moonlight

845.65 --> 850.18
which will likely be heat more warm

848.5 --> 854.26
because it's been heating up in the day

850.18 --> 857.68
and then air gets cold the quickest so

854.26 --> 859.84
the ground will be hotter then the air

857.68 --> 862.03
above during when the moon is out and

859.84 --> 864.19
then if the moonlight hit such a spot

862.03 --> 866.9499999999999
and the moonlight would actually change

864.19 --> 870.0400000000001
the frequency of the matter in order to

866.95 --> 871.6
let entropy engage more quickly to let

870.04 --> 874.0
the heat get out more quickly then

871.6 --> 877.96
measurements would result in that

874.0 --> 881.62
location as if the light were literally

877.96 --> 884.38
cold but it may not be cold energy or

881.62 --> 887.08
cold extracting energy may simply be

884.38 --> 891.1
another effect that is changing the way

887.08 --> 894.22
he transfers and it could be tested this

891.1 --> 901.12
kind of thing because if the situation

894.22 --> 903.19
were different let's say you take a room

901.12 --> 906.569
with an open roof

903.19 --> 909.519
and a not a glass ceiling but a a

906.569 --> 911.529
certain plastic type ceiling that is

909.519 --> 914.92
still transparent that will not block

911.529 --> 917.35
any yeah blocked a more niche type of

914.92 --> 920.17
light race it will not absorb it like

917.35 --> 924.4300000000001
glass das it's known to do that and then

920.17 --> 927.43
at night when the moon is out make sure

924.43 --> 928.6289999999999
that the temperature of within that

927.43 --> 930.279
closed off box

928.629 --> 932.649
technically the air is closed off but

930.279 --> 934.42
it's still an open system for light so

932.649 --> 936.459
the light will be able to get in then if

934.42 --> 940.06
the temperature is exactly the same of

936.459 --> 942.7299999999999
the air as the ground and the moonlit

940.06 --> 943.3889999999999
light at the hits and my theory is

942.73 --> 946.41
correct

943.389 --> 951.879
there will be no temperature difference

946.41 --> 955.449
that is that is a an actual experimental

951.879 --> 957.009
lead setup to figure this one out figure

955.449 --> 960.16
out if there is something about moon

957.009 --> 963.72
lights that allows heat to transfer more

960.16 --> 967.24
quickly which could mean for me the only

963.72 --> 969.9390000000001
fathomable way to explain how moonlight

967.24 --> 973.48
could register things to be more cold

969.939 --> 976.949
it's an actual viable idea in my opinion

973.48 --> 982.48
and it literally came out of nowhere

976.949 --> 985.529
just by reading that sentence there so

982.48 --> 985.529
what do you guys think

987.08 --> 990.2990000000001
[Music]

1001.01 --> 1004.23
[Music]

1010.759 --> 1016.589
something is blocking the heat radiation

1014.309 --> 1020.16
no that is [ __ ] set that be that

1016.589 --> 1023.7790000000001
excuse about all the wind that is just

1020.16 --> 1026.49
total horseshit absolute horseshit I

1023.779 --> 1029.819
look I tested the freaking moon like

1026.49 --> 1031.86
myself with a thermometer and it does

1029.819 --> 1036.11
result even in the open it's total

1031.86 --> 1039.0
nonsense doesn't matter if there's

1036.11 --> 1042.029
anything you could do it in a night when

1039.0 --> 1044.549
there's moon and there's no wind yeah

1042.029 --> 1047.939
and you don't need a freakin cover-up

1044.549 --> 1051.6299999999999
it's all nonsense the effect is that

1047.939 --> 1054.39
moonlight however that works and I just

1051.63 --> 1058.19
put forth a theory for that that can

1054.39 --> 1062.2700000000002
actually be tested I did do it and

1058.19 --> 1066.27
moonlight does result in more cold

1062.27 --> 1070.039
register register temperature then not

1066.27 --> 1078.21
in the moonlight there's nothing to do

1070.039 --> 1081.0
the aerodynamics of anything I did that

1078.21 --> 1086.7
and I didn't do it on camera because

1081.0 --> 1089.789
that was way before you to I think I did

1086.7 --> 1092.25
that the body of mine 2011 I borrowed

1089.789 --> 1094.82
his thermometer for that he had a lot of

1092.25 --> 1094.82
tech equipment

1100.53 --> 1108.3
yeah I did think about it cept happy and

1103.64 --> 1112.1100000000001
the open sky look it is still going to

1108.3 --> 1116.79
be an open sky just if you put something

1112.11 --> 1118.6499999999999
in between the moon light right and

1116.79 --> 1121.11
where it is where you're measuring it

1118.65 --> 1125.21
doesn't matter it's still the open sky

1121.11 --> 1125.2099999999998
it's ridiculous arguments really

1132.69 --> 1139.789
and besides it's moving the actual

1136.619 --> 1143.1589999999999
argument I'm not calling it cold light

1139.789 --> 1145.229
I'm not saying that literal cold is

1143.159 --> 1149.009
transferred like it's another type of

1145.229 --> 1153.779
heat energy no and I don't see how light

1149.009 --> 1156.869
could detract heat from anything I've

1153.779 --> 1161.46
never heard of that concept so I just

1156.869 --> 1164.1789999999999
gave an alternative hypotheses as to

1161.46 --> 1168.179
what it could be and how to test it

1164.179 --> 1170.3990000000001
because in reality I have measured this

1168.179 --> 1172.2
temperature from the moonlight and in

1170.399 --> 1175.2289999999998
the shadow of the moonlight and it's

1172.2 --> 1178.979
real and everyone that's gonna say it's

1175.229 --> 1183.419
not real never tried it out and they're

1178.979 --> 1186.749
just really annoying I tried it out and

1183.419 --> 1188.429
I'll do it again if I need to if I as

1186.749 --> 1191.249
soon as I get money together you know

1188.429 --> 1194.669
how maybe in a couple of years or

1191.249 --> 1196.6490000000001
something and everything gets rolling

1194.669 --> 1199.289
and I got my camera and I got more stuff

1196.649 --> 1201.9189999999999
to spend for gadgets to do this kind of

1199.289 --> 1205.559
thing I'll show it to you guys again

1201.919 --> 1209.5490000000002
show it again also there's another way

1205.559 --> 1211.9189999999999
even now to two years ago a guy I don't

1209.549 --> 1215.849
even have members name but we got

1211.919 --> 1218.5490000000002
talking over Skype and he said look how

1215.849 --> 1222.899
about a Sun cooker a Sun cooker is it is

1218.549 --> 1225.599
a device that uses the light of the Sun

1222.899 --> 1226.2589999999998
to heat something and cook it it's very

1225.599 --> 1228.21
effective

1226.259 --> 1236.119
well what if you use that same device

1228.21 --> 1236.1190000000001
for the moon well very quick to find out

1243.37 --> 1252.4299999999998
now search echo I just told you this was

1246.67 --> 1254.53
way before YouTube way before I got

1252.43 --> 1263.77
anywhere near YouTube besides just

1254.53 --> 1267.73
looking sometimes yeah moon cooker or a

1263.77 --> 1274.3899999999999
moon freezer I'll bet it's not gonna get

1267.73 --> 1277.21
any hotter for a moonlight but yeah

1274.39 --> 1279.3700000000001
these devices are literally for sale

1277.21 --> 1285.3700000000001
have been for some time they're not that

1279.37 --> 1287.9099999999999
expensive so I heard and in if you live

1285.37 --> 1292.35
in a very you know in a more warm zone

1287.91 --> 1292.3500000000001
it's always a good device to have

1301.8 --> 1305.96
I don't have a Fresno screen

1308.29 --> 1319.35
I don't even know what that is yeah

1326.75 --> 1335.3
please just go back trolling the debates

1330.72 --> 1335.3
Jets thank you very much

1347.95 --> 1356.32
a big magnifying glass yeah right sure

1353.64 --> 1360.19
all of those things should have some

1356.32 --> 1361.87
kind of influence and I'd love to to

1360.19 --> 1365.8600000000001
fool around with it and I'll do it on

1361.87 --> 1369.79
camera it's all fine it's really it it

1365.86 --> 1373.299
still doesn't prove anything other than

1369.79 --> 1377.47
that the moon is very weird and it's

1373.299 --> 1381.03
definitely not reflecting sunlight but

1377.47 --> 1381.03
that is just a given anyway

1384.67 --> 1389.13
yeah a yellow sleeping warrior

1401.45 --> 1408.349
I'm open for guests today by the way so

1405.349 --> 1410.839
rather wants to join or even if a baller

1408.349 --> 1413.229
wants to join you know it's all fine

1410.839 --> 1413.229
with me

1413.92 --> 1417.0890000000002
[Music]

1439.149 --> 1441.6899999999998
yeah

1457.48 --> 1463.65
[Music]

1459.83 --> 1466.3999999999999
so yeah man I listened back to

1463.65 --> 1468.71
yesterday's show that sucks

1466.4 --> 1474.75
wasn't doing good at all

1468.71 --> 1477.059
should really learn to not give people

1474.75 --> 1480.419
like every freaking detail of what I've

1477.059 --> 1483.26
done it's really annoying gonna try to

1480.419 --> 1483.26
stop doing that

1490.16 --> 1493.0900000000001
hmm

1518.13 --> 1530.5200000000002
all right yeah not eating anything much

1522.12 --> 1533.1299999999999
this morning Amanda young it's getting

1530.52 --> 1535.86
to the tight period financially for me

1533.13 --> 1540.48
right now that's usually up to half wait

1535.86 --> 1548.039
a month and some things start rolling in

1540.48 --> 1549.84
again yes that happy I am going to the

1548.039 --> 1560.78
EFI conference I've been sharing that

1549.84 --> 1560.78
for months still a long way to go though

1563.7 --> 1566.99
at least a month

1567.619 --> 1572.389
but I'll be there definitely

1594.58 --> 1597.36
hmm

1607.0 --> 1609.72
all right

1626.5 --> 1634.64
well

1628.32 --> 1637.83
yeah free feel right

1634.64 --> 1640.68
what causes half-moons if it moon has

1637.83 --> 1643.3999999999999
its own light well it's kind of slightly

1640.68 --> 1648.8400000000001
different it's rather that the moon is

1643.4 --> 1650.5500000000002
its own light because the moon is pretty

1648.84 --> 1653.73
sure the moon is not some kind of object

1650.55 --> 1660.12
floating out there giving off its own

1653.73 --> 1663.92
light at night there is a Sun but it's

1660.12 --> 1663.9199999999998
definitely a separate type of light

1679.97 --> 1682.97
okay

1694.45 --> 1699.76
no no the earth is the earth

1717.159 --> 1721.3300000000002
all right

1718.7 --> 1721.3300000000002
yep

1722.72 --> 1727.46
that's the funny thing about it our

1725.09 --> 1730.1899999999998
diversity is actually our strength

1727.46 --> 1733.4
because we're still trying to figure out

1730.19 --> 1738.76
what it all is and ballers are just

1733.4 --> 1742.6100000000001
going why the narrative of what is said

1738.76 --> 1744.83
and they may sometimes draw that into

1742.61 --> 1747.56
doubt a little and think it's a cover

1744.83 --> 1751.8799999999999
for something else that'll still make it

1747.56 --> 1755.4099999999999
all believable but flat earthers are

1751.88 --> 1759.14
just saying we don't really know

1755.41 --> 1761.45
so what could it be and then figure out

1759.14 --> 1764.9
all the possibilities so yeah that'll

1761.45 --> 1769.04
lead to a lot of different concepts that

1764.9 --> 1771.02
all have their pitfalls and sometimes if

1769.04 --> 1774.6399999999999
you're lucky ways to be able to test

1771.02 --> 1780.04
whether it is true or not

1774.64 --> 1783.3500000000001
falsifiability and yeah it's a giant

1780.04 --> 1786.1
playground for experimentation to try

1783.35 --> 1786.1
and figure it out

1802.29 --> 1805.1
all right

1810.07 --> 1818.3
but you see the thing about this

1812.99 --> 1823.76
supposed model of reality is is it's not

1818.3 --> 1825.98
perfect it's not even complete it still

1823.76 --> 1829.34
they still need to keep on working

1825.98 --> 1831.95
because it's not complete so you can of

1829.34 --> 1833.8999999999999
course comparative reality but it is

1831.95 --> 1837.5
definitely not an accurate

1833.9 --> 1841.21
representation of reality knowingly and

1837.5 --> 1844.19
admittedly because it's not complete and

1841.21 --> 1850.3
that means to assume anything about it

1844.19 --> 1850.3
is absolutely real is an illusion

1884.72 --> 1897.83
no no I'm actually quite clear about all

1887.6 --> 1900.8
of this fray feel quite clear all these

1897.83 --> 1906.9499999999998
models of reality are all attempts and

1900.8 --> 1910.61
they all end up in unresolved or wrong

1906.95 --> 1912.53
or somebody claiming it's real nobody

1910.61 --> 1914.9299999999998
getting it until somebody does get it in

1912.53 --> 1918.68
turned out not to be real and it's a

1914.93 --> 1927.8300000000002
giant woozy mess up there in the details

1918.68 --> 1930.74
that is the reality that is reality the

1927.83 --> 1933.32
reality is that it's a mess in the

1930.74 --> 1937.46
official story it's just very big and

1933.32 --> 1941.4199999999998
parts of it do seem very viable but it's

1937.46 --> 1944.45
not complete not by a long shot it's

1941.42 --> 1947.72
still all rag doll of bits and pieces

1944.45 --> 1951.0800000000002
everywhere pretending to be a a

1947.72 --> 1953.66
wholesome whole and it's not it's a

1951.08 --> 1956.23
giant mess keeps on rearranging the

1953.66 --> 1956.23
whole model

1961.94 --> 1965.039
[Music]

1973.42 --> 1982.78
indeed I think that denialism is a huge

1976.33 --> 1986.4099999999999
part about it because how frustrating is

1982.78 --> 1989.17
that that you're leaning upon a majority

1986.41 --> 1992.5600000000002
of people in a group and a trust in a

1989.17 --> 1995.0800000000002
system that gives such a vast vast

1992.56 --> 1999.3999999999999
amount of data and that makes a claim

1995.08 --> 2004.4399999999998
about all that data and then it's pretty

1999.4 --> 2006.72
horrific once you actually get there to

2004.44 --> 2008.76
really see it and really grasp it and

2006.72 --> 2013.08
make it sure for yourself all of it

2008.76 --> 2015.36
most of it it makes sense of it that you

2013.08 --> 2018.83
figure out that it's actually not very

2015.36 --> 2018.83
consistent at all

2045.39 --> 2049.649
whoo that's fascinated that sounds

2047.52 --> 2055.5
really interesting

2049.649 --> 2061.409
Ian Beale reverse frequency driving

2055.5 --> 2064.29
polarity huh well yeah I said it would

2061.409 --> 2066.6
probably be frequency based because

2064.29 --> 2069.899
there is frequency in light and things

2066.6 --> 2073.74
can even be altered through like

2069.899 --> 2077.0699999999997
frequency with the polarity and so I

2073.74 --> 2080.0099999999998
think yeah I don't have a complete grasp

2077.07 --> 2082.53
over what you're saying right there but

2080.01 --> 2093.2700000000004
I think that might be exactly correct

2082.53 --> 2099.3900000000003
and I already proposed in how to test

2093.27 --> 2101.75
this I think spend enough time on you

2099.39 --> 2101.75
buddy

2108.21 --> 2111.599
[Music]

2125.05 --> 2128.739
[Music]

2128.74 --> 2138.41
yes--if check oh these days I I kind of

2132.02 --> 2140.63
like to let trolls first realize for a

2138.41 --> 2144.3199999999997
while that they did go too far and that

2140.63 --> 2146.2400000000002
they will get banned and not just work

2144.32 --> 2149.8
them out as quickly as possible but just

2146.24 --> 2152.75
let them sit there for awhile

2149.8 --> 2154.67
noticing that their attempts didn't

2152.75 --> 2158.36
really work they're gaslighting attempts

2154.67 --> 2161.48
didn't work and that they can literally

2158.36 --> 2164.27
as a release of that feel that they are

2161.48 --> 2166.34
going to get banned I'd like to give

2164.27 --> 2171.11
them that sensation before I actually do

2166.34 --> 2173.71
it so they can experience knowing that

2171.11 --> 2173.71
it's coming

2182.53 --> 2185.53
hmm

2188.62 --> 2196.44
so who's out here 33 watching now hmm

[Music]

2559.539 --> 2570.65
yeah well you do need Skype to add me on

2564.109 --> 2572.239
skype that's true M rates J max it's

2570.65 --> 2575.6800000000003
kind of hard trying to add me without

2572.239 --> 2575.68
having Skype installed

2579.29 --> 2582.34
[Music]

2590.779 --> 2595.749
don't worry Karen B it's an early Sunday

2593.719 --> 2595.7490000000003
morning

2601.92 --> 2605.01
[Music]

2683.04 --> 2686.77
yeah I was on mute thanks for reminding

2686.35 --> 2694.45
me

2686.77 --> 2696.43
didn't say much though so yeah I think

2694.45 --> 2701.0699999999997
I'm having a little bit more trouble

2696.43 --> 2704.5
these days filling this this early slot

2701.07 --> 2708.2200000000003
time slot because just it's just so rare

2704.5 --> 2714.04
for people to get on and when they get

2708.22 --> 2716.02
on it's still kind of slow usually while

2714.04 --> 2719.2599999999998
in the later things and the later

2716.02 --> 2719.83
hangouts when I join in idea I just get

2719.26 --> 2724.7200000000003
going

2719.83 --> 2726.31
you've heard me when I do that it's kind

2724.72 --> 2729.54
of tough though because unless I just

2726.31 --> 2733.84
spend several hours and making notes

2729.54 --> 2738.58
it's very hard to fill an hour even just

2733.84 --> 2740.29
an hour with me talking and I kind of

2738.58 --> 2742.75
regret every time where I'm sitting

2740.29 --> 2744.52
looking at the chat and sometimes

2742.75 --> 2746.71
something really good comes out of it

2744.52 --> 2748.66
hey I got some good questions today or

2746.71 --> 2751.44
provoking questions and I don't really

2748.66 --> 2753.8199999999997
care whether a question is provoking as

2751.44 --> 2756.58
long as it's good it's good and I can

2753.82 --> 2758.1000000000004
work with that but sometimes I'm just

2756.58 --> 2760.45
having these long breaks and then

2758.1 --> 2770.44
nothing happens and that's really kind

2760.45 --> 2774.31
of a bummer so it is what it is I think

2770.44 --> 2776.86
that yeah the issue would very much be

2774.31 --> 2779.83
resolved on the long term still having

2776.86 --> 2782.08
this law if I would have things like

2779.83 --> 2784.21
equipment and life streaming capability

2782.08 --> 2786.64
mobile life streaming capabilities and

2784.21 --> 2792.09
then I could fill the time with pretty

2786.64 --> 2795.3399999999997
much a lot of things without yeah

2792.09 --> 2798.01
getting these silent moments and well or

2795.34 --> 2801.73
getting like interesting silent moments

2798.01 --> 2805.4700000000003
with pretty things to look at and that's

2801.73 --> 2808.15
never bad not that I think I'm ugly but

2805.47 --> 2810.5099999999998
yeah it's gotta be the same old same old

2808.15 --> 2810.51
you know

2813.369 --> 2819.9100000000003
any luck yet with the installing the

2816.71 --> 2819.91
Skype Emmerich's j-mac

2836.51 --> 2839.1400000000003
yeah

2843.329 --> 2850.48
you know one of the more fascinating

2846.039 --> 2852.789
things that yeah that I just wish I

2850.48 --> 2854.95
could film because then I could just

2852.789 --> 2857.289
take back that film and just talk about

2854.95 --> 2859.45
that for like five minutes because

2857.289 --> 2862.5
sometimes when I'm for example on the

2859.45 --> 2867.5389999999998
roof in the evening I get these sites

2862.5 --> 2873.19
from the Sun and clouds that is just so

2867.539 --> 2875.4700000000003
unbelievably surreal how how the light

2873.19 --> 2880.779
is worked through that and just how it

2875.47 --> 2884.14
looks it really does look so incredibly

2880.779 --> 2886.839
holographic in nature and not like an

2884.14 --> 2891.0589999999997
object like a lamp somewhere behind the

2886.839 --> 2891.0589999999997
clouds it just looks so incredibly

2892.26 --> 2899.079
holographic like a giant fractal like

2895.69 --> 2903.9900000000002
the light is not from a physical object

2899.079 --> 2909.19
but from some other dimension almost

2903.99 --> 2917.8289999999997
right that's just the impression and it

2909.19 --> 2919.66
gives such incredible views just the you

2917.829 --> 2921.25
remember how beautiful it is but when

2919.66 --> 2926.319
you actually look at it and look at it

2921.25 --> 2930.4
with your own eyes and 3d it is really

2926.319 --> 2937.839
miraculous to look at and I wish I could

2930.4 --> 2941.759
won't release some of that some more all

2937.839 --> 2941.759
right good to talk to you Karen be

2947.24 --> 2950.35
[Music]

2955.579 --> 2964.6090000000004
now I disagree PJ the biggest obstacle

2959.88 --> 2964.609
to progress is red herring

2965.99 --> 2983.339
that's that's definitely universally the

2971.49 --> 2986.2099999999996
biggest obstacle to progress mm-hmm I'm

2983.339 --> 2986.21
sure you did

2995.56 --> 3000.86
a the miss Kang

3027.83 --> 3034.13
I think he's about to share the

3030.86 --> 3035.57
discovery of this story that he made up

3034.13 --> 3039.11
and that he's been telling us for the

3035.57 --> 3043.48
last three years I think that's probably

3039.11 --> 3043.48
going to be the discovery let's see

3051.51 --> 3054.8790000000004
[Music]

3058.949 --> 3071.4990000000003
okay all right that's interesting

3067.829 --> 3074.949
did you know that in the Book of Enoch I

3071.499 --> 3078.0989999999997
think somewhere we're also the part now

3074.949 --> 3080.169
roughly pointing back at videos I saw

3078.099 --> 3081.9390000000003
from flatwater that delves into that

3080.169 --> 3084.779
where also the portals of the Sun are

3081.939 --> 3088.1789999999996
discussed and is also discussed that

3084.779 --> 3091.029
literally windows into what could be

3088.179 --> 3098.529
considered just the air dimension open

3091.029 --> 3101.979
up and breath is introduced to claim

3098.529 --> 3106.029
that a literal physical structure is

3101.979 --> 3108.759
moving like like a lung could move in

3106.029 --> 3113.65
order to displace air it's a little bit

3108.759 --> 3115.599
far-fetched maybe just a little still

3113.65 --> 3117.64
have to prove there's actually that

3115.599 --> 3121.409
physical thing there in order for that

3117.64 --> 3121.4089999999997
to be able to be possible

3133.01 --> 3140.69
did seven months to get Skype

3136.96 --> 3144.17
well maybe you'd like to instead try to

3140.69 --> 3147.98
download the app on your solid line

3144.17 --> 3153.109
computer and then I don't know transfer

3147.98 --> 3160.25
it through USB or something if it's that

3153.109 --> 3162.41
slow to download on your mobile yes I

3160.25 --> 3165.02
well I haven't read the world beyond the

3162.41 --> 3167.06
poles but I know it exists that I've

3165.02 --> 3169.88
been confronted with several with it

3167.06 --> 3175.609
several times even in the past and I've

3169.88 --> 3177.8
seen the videos that talk about it that

3175.609 --> 3183.19
tell the story it's very fascinating

3177.8 --> 3187.6600000000003
book and it does really kind of relate

3183.19 --> 3191.4700000000003
to the rectangular looping earth concept

3187.66 --> 3197.18
because it is probably the very first

3191.47 --> 3200.48
story that actually says go to the north

3197.18 --> 3205.39
and you end up in the South in quite a

3200.48 --> 3205.39
literal sense it's the first

3211.119 --> 3213.15
Oh

3224.12 --> 3238.73
that's you're getting a timeout for that

3227.6 --> 3244.62
it's just so [ __ ] no no Pete

3238.73 --> 3248.61
absolutely not the truth is specifically

3244.62 --> 3252.66
not known and we're not coming to read

3248.61 --> 3256.53
it we are finding clues everywhere in

3252.66 --> 3259.56
reading material in all kinds of things

3256.53 --> 3264.09
and we're trying to put the puzzle

3259.56 --> 3266.94
together it's not known I bet even many

3264.09 --> 3272.28
controllers don't really know it they

3266.94 --> 3274.32
may know a part of it perhaps do you

3272.28 --> 3274.86
really think they even want to know that

3274.32 --> 3276.96
[ __ ]

3274.86 --> 3279.15
the real controllers do you think they

3276.96 --> 3281.55
have time in their mind to preoccupy

3279.15 --> 3283.98
themselves with that kind of what to

3281.55 --> 3286.71
them nonsense when they could spend

3283.98 --> 3288.39
their time getting into people's mind

3286.71 --> 3291.12
and blackmailing them and getting more

3288.39 --> 3296.0
money and power you know why would they

3291.12 --> 3296.0
give a [ __ ] about any of these things

3308.43 --> 3320.94
the need to know the truth and curiosity

3311.28 --> 3323.8700000000003
is for those who walk the light the dark

3320.94 --> 3323.87
doesn't give a [ __ ]

3329.73 --> 3333.09
[Music]

3337.46 --> 3344.58
well yeah the Chris Matt that that is

3340.65 --> 3350.9900000000002
good isn't it isn't that fascinating but

3344.58 --> 3350.99
guess what that is how he describes what

3351.17 --> 3359.79
he understands of it so if you just take

3357.0 --> 3363.12
away the presuppositional structuring

3359.79 --> 3365.73
the standard thinking approach of trying

3363.12 --> 3368.15
to describe it to people that you he's

3365.73 --> 3370.71
gonna expect are not really gonna get it

3368.15 --> 3372.75
maybe he doesn't even get it what he's

3370.71 --> 3376.19
seeing he's just trying to describe it

3372.75 --> 3379.71
so you gotta approach it like that and

3376.19 --> 3382.16
then you see it is kind of there is

3379.71 --> 3385.56
uncertainty within the description

3382.16 --> 3389.18
there's definitely not absolute clarity

3385.56 --> 3393.09
there's no geometrical clarity at all

3389.18 --> 3397.49
it's very fake and he has trouble

3393.09 --> 3397.4900000000002
conceiving what he is even experiencing

3407.669 --> 3414.0989999999997
but what I definitely did get out of it

3410.259 --> 3417.009
is went to the north wooed went to the

3414.099 --> 3419.8590000000004
new mysterious Islands ran into these

3417.009 --> 3422.439
tall giant figures with kind of ancient

3419.859 --> 3427.299
garbs almost like Tartary and very

3422.439 --> 3432.279
gifted feeling of Tartarian and move

3427.299 --> 3434.739
beyond then went all over the place

3432.279 --> 3437.529
through the sea and saw this weird

3434.739 --> 3441.779
amazing stuff then he supposedly went

3437.529 --> 3444.609
back by going in another direction and

3441.779 --> 3446.559
then having this fast trip and the

3444.609 --> 3450.0389999999998
accident that killed his dad and

3446.559 --> 3452.619
everything and then he supposedly came

3450.039 --> 3458.0190000000002
out in the south and what was it like

3452.619 --> 3461.7690000000002
bumped into South Africa or something I

3458.019 --> 3463.8999999999996
don't remember exactly but he definitely

3461.769 --> 3468.8799999999997
did not freaking returned from the north

3463.9 --> 3473.789
so yeah how how are you going to explain

3468.88 --> 3477.4790000000003
that with any cosmo genie other than a

3473.789 --> 3481.119
looping spatially limited confine i

3477.479 --> 3483.009
don't know any other way except you it's

3481.119 --> 3485.1400000000003
a ball and you're moving in an inside

3483.009 --> 3490.839
ball maybe you could imagine it like

3485.14 --> 3497.5589999999997
that good maybe still very very very

3490.839 --> 3500.739
bizarre like how would a the earth

3497.559 --> 3507.039
confined within a disc be contained

3500.739 --> 3509.529
within no no it's not a concave thing

3507.039 --> 3513.659
that doesn't really directly suggest

3509.529 --> 3515.729
that at all but yeah with the little

3513.659 --> 3520.089
flexibility of mind you could it

3515.729 --> 3524.729
interpreted that way he probably did a

3520.089 --> 3527.589
little I know a lot of concave earth

3524.729 --> 3535.08
theories came out of that book because

3527.589 --> 3545.58
of that book hey somebody

3535.08 --> 3545.58
I'm contacting yes ah ah you it worked

3548.97 --> 3565.8689999999997

bitching and would you be talking about

3605.53 --> 3608.8590000000004
the things that I'm into you know I've

3607.599 --> 3611.8900000000003
been I've been a flat earther for about

3608.859 --> 3617.339
five years now and I got involved with

3611.89 --> 3623.08
this watching Jerry and marks origin and

3617.339 --> 3628.57
eventually Patricia and met a power land

3623.08 --> 3632.38
and everybody so I got to find you and

3628.57 --> 3635.65
then found you a couple years ago and

3632.38 --> 3637.81
then I found Nathan a couple years ago

3635.65 --> 3639.4900000000002
you know probably now I've been just

3637.81 --> 3641.98
chilling with you guys did you find me

3639.49 --> 3643.27
first before Nathan I found you before

3641.98 --> 3647.23
this yes Wow

3643.27 --> 3649.3
okay cool how if I may ask you you you

3647.23 --> 3651.7
had a you had another show before the

3649.3 --> 3657.94
early bird show that yeah that's right

3651.7 --> 3660.1299999999997
and another show yeah yes talks so I

3657.94 --> 3662.29
used to watch that it was just what it

3660.13 --> 3665.4100000000003
is you're a gamer so that's what it

3662.29 --> 3667.42
tracked you're a gamer and you smoke

3665.41 --> 3668.23
weed of course but you're a gamer so you

3667.42 --> 3671.14
talk about the interest

3668.23 --> 3672.369
things in the game that you play so back

3671.14 --> 3677.77
then you were talking about a lot of

3672.369 --> 3678.75
different spiritual stuff I liked which

3677.77 --> 3680.71
one

3678.75 --> 3683.08
back in Europe back in the early days

3680.71 --> 3686.56
you were talking about a lot you play

3683.08 --> 3687.93
you play like you play like Might and

3686.56 --> 3691.24
Magic games

3687.93 --> 3693.25
well role-playing well I do role but but

3691.24 --> 3695.3199999999997
that's not computer games I talked about

3693.25 --> 3698.109
D&D and I still do

3695.32 --> 3701.19
I'm a game master I wrote a book

3698.109 --> 3708.54
basically a technical rule book

3701.19 --> 3711.34
thousands of pages for a do you need

3708.54 --> 3712.93
okay

3711.34 --> 3717.2200000000003
you should play computer games a lot but

3712.93 --> 3720.52
now I'm on Xbox now I'm play arc and not

3717.22 --> 3725.95
right Frank arc is a crazy game I love

3720.52 --> 3728.68
it what is that hockey ball oh my god

3725.95 --> 3731.9199999999996
if you want to just sit back and it's a

3728.68 --> 3734.89
dinosaur game where you go out tame

3731.92 --> 3739.9900000000002
dinosaurs fight other dinosaurs run from

3734.89 --> 3742.71
dinosaurs do big boss fights with lots

3739.99 --> 3744.8799999999997
of dinosaurs that's like diner obviously

3742.71 --> 3751.33
yes Wow

3744.88 --> 3755.38
well done that's where dinosaurs were

3751.33 --> 3757.6
invented for for games like that for

3755.38 --> 3762.94
years now I've been started off with a

3757.6 --> 3768.33
beta player on it into it - it was like

3762.94 --> 3771.4900000000002
- now there's like five DLCs in you know

3768.33 --> 3778.0499999999997
actually doom of course everybody plays

3771.49 --> 3780.2799999999997
it destiny of course everybody plays it

3778.05 --> 3781.57
but console game what you don't play

3780.28 --> 3785.8590000000004
console games you only play computer

3781.57 --> 3788.44
games sorry castle game Oh console cop

3785.859 --> 3793.96
no now I haven't had a console in a long

3788.44 --> 3796.0
time I have a typical history I think in

3793.96 --> 3798.609
computer gaming as started out with

3796.0 --> 3801.1
Commodore 64 for my brother he was

3798.609 --> 3804.34
fooling around with even trying program

3801.1 --> 3805.75
in Seoul during stuff and plugging it in

3804.34 --> 3807.7000000000003
and trying it out and he was doing all

3805.75 --> 3810.07
kinds of [ __ ] with that and I love the

3807.7 --> 3818.2599999999998
games I was like total game addict right

3810.07 --> 3821.26
away and that moved on to is it yeah

3818.26 --> 3823.8100000000004
first I got a Nintendo and NES before

3821.26 --> 3829.21
that and yeah that's when I got really

3823.81 --> 3834.39
socially I started to lock myself up in

3829.21 --> 3834.39
a dark room with just the screen Mario

3838.23 --> 3847.39
yeah yeah and after that my sari

3844.62 --> 3851.35
migrated on Super Nintendo then I got

3847.39 --> 3854.7
more serious into the Amiga which was

3851.35 --> 3858.22
back at a time had some amazing things

3854.7 --> 3860.8799999999997
for the time just incredible music and

3858.22 --> 3864.1
still the music they have a sound system

3860.88 --> 3865.65
like a certain chip with sound effects

3864.1 --> 3868.0299999999997
that at that time were like

3865.65 --> 3871.6600000000003
revolutionary synthesizer sounds and

3868.03 --> 3873.34
half the retro world still rides on

3871.66 --> 3879.94
these sound effects and the Commodore 64

3873.34 --> 3885.25
sound effects so making music

3879.94 --> 3888.55
back in the 90s I Stu is to make music

3885.25 --> 3889.42

3945.35 --> 3950.0299999999997

3947.42 --> 3951.62
controversial and confusing but he just

3950.03 --> 3954.92
keeps on saying the same things over and

3951.62 --> 3959.87

3954.92 --> 3961.7000000000003

4030.19 --> 4038.41
interesting though so what are you

4033.37 --> 4040.99
experiencing in in gaming and do you

4038.41 --> 4044.74
still wait right now I'm into a lot of

4040.99 --> 4049.2099999999996
like I'm into kicking back now I like to

4044.74 --> 4052.72
kick back and Ark is more just steady

4049.21 --> 4055.7200000000003
you can relax lose yourself in there

4052.72 --> 4059.1699999999996
ride the Dinos like right now I'm

4055.72 --> 4062.1099999999997
getting myself built up you know

4059.17 --> 4065.17
wolves together so I can go down into

4062.11 --> 4069.13
this [ __ ] cave and kill this big ass

4065.17 --> 4071.65
spider okay so that sounds very much if

4069.13 --> 4073.63
I just hear the preliminaries sounds

4071.65 --> 4078.04
very much like a new world of warcraft

4073.63 --> 4081.1
in a dinosaur setting yes yes really

4078.04 --> 4086.14
but much bigger than water Warcraft not

4081.1 --> 4088.66
cartoony and no no I gotta send you a

4086.14 --> 4090.4
link or one of my videos yeah I know but

4088.66 --> 4092.8599999999997
you do but I'm not gonna play it though

4090.4 --> 4096.1900000000005
I I don't even play those type of games

4092.86 --> 4101.26
anymore I literally had two hits on

4096.19 --> 4104.5
computer it's your love it bro I don't

4101.26 --> 4106.02
know maybe your love it

4104.5 --> 4107.98
I'll tell you you want to just

4106.02 --> 4110.5
especially when you were sitting down

4107.98 --> 4113.469999999999
thinking about your material for you for

4110.5 --> 4116.17
the show you can get in there you run

4113.47 --> 4118.39
around thinking about okay look at that

4116.17 --> 4120.07
moon alright

4118.39 --> 4123.64
oh well yeah you could use it any game

4120.07 --> 4127.12
for that look at that moon in the sky I

4123.64 --> 4131.62
got the same moon I see outside I'd like

4127.12 --> 4135.19
to point back to the early quake 3 game

4131.62 --> 4139.99
engine yes remember that the impossible

4135.19 --> 4142.45
quick virtual system that was crazy back

4139.99 --> 4147.7
then yeah Thunder unreal now quake is

4142.45 --> 4150.61
under the unreal label now right yeah

4147.7 --> 4152.53
the only unlocking a server and their

4150.61 --> 4156.25
games are so much doom it's just coming

4152.53 --> 4158.23
back on that I don't do it anymore I was

4156.25 --> 4162.58
fascinated at the time because it was

4158.23 --> 4164.5
the 3d experience developing but now

4162.58 --> 4169.24
that's pretty much fulfilled and now

4164.5 --> 4172.27
it's just room for ya indoctrination a

4169.24 --> 4174.13
lot no core they've become too good at

4172.27 --> 4178.18
it and now I don't like it anymore

4174.13 --> 4180.61
I just don't like it anymore oh yeah the

4178.18 --> 4183.85
Dreamcast was nice back in the day the

4180.61 --> 4186.37
Dreamcast was nice exploit you want a

4183.85 --> 4191.43
lot of good games on the Dreamcast was

4186.37 --> 4191.43
really interesting music also it did

4192.44 --> 4199.78
it's really jazzy songs and [ __ ]

4195.14 --> 4203.030000000001
lingered interesting experimental stuff

4199.78 --> 4206.8099999999995
if I remember the steam engine to get

4203.03 --> 4209.389999999999
the steam engine you can download like

4206.81 --> 4215.89
music creators so you can play your

4209.39 --> 4219.47
music in the game that you create cool

4215.89 --> 4230.030000000001
no I've never been a music creator

4219.47 --> 4233.360000000001
though so you design freaking necklaces

4230.03 --> 4242.179999999999
and crystals crap so you have a creative

4233.36 --> 4245.509999999999
mind I know but hey it's the weird thing

4242.18 --> 4247.610000000001
is if I could really be into music I

4245.51 --> 4251.18
would have been for a long long time

4247.61 --> 4254.299999999999
because my mother literally wasn't a

4251.18 --> 4258.4400000000005
teacher a high high level teacher in

4254.3 --> 4262.43
music and my entire family was music

4258.44 --> 4264.5
oriented but I have played some

4262.43 --> 4267.83
instruments I kind of have this tendency

4264.5 --> 4271.01
to be a singer thing but at the same

4267.83 --> 4273.29
time I'm also very shy in that stuff and

4271.01 --> 4276.31
I have to like accidentally just do it

4273.29 --> 4280.66
because I'm comfortable because if I

4276.31 --> 4284.330000000001
just try to do it then I get so nervous

4280.66 --> 4288.5
and my voice is like that great right

4284.33 --> 4291.7699999999995
well you got a for me I do it all so for

4288.5 --> 4294.59
me I'm one of those people who I make up

4291.77 --> 4298.820000000001
stuff on the fly you know you can make

4294.59 --> 4302.78
up like to your early bird intro iiv

4298.82 --> 4305.299999999999
this is so crazy how that little beat

4302.78 --> 4309.65
isn't how that music is on there are you

4305.3 --> 4313.37
singing to that crap yeah yeah it was

4309.65 --> 4315.94
just perfect it the other little song I

4313.37 --> 4319.34
don't know it was very special because

4315.94 --> 4321.259999999999
Chris bury me it kind of we worked

4319.34 --> 4323.67
together in the process of making it

4321.26 --> 4326.58
like he gave me something and I was like

4323.67 --> 4328.4400000000005
not really you got something more like

4326.58 --> 4329.73
this then he tried something out and I

4328.44 --> 4332.339999999999
was like oh that's better

4329.73 --> 4333.78
a little bit more like this and then he

4332.34 --> 4339.9890000000005
this came out of it

4333.78 --> 4342.03
and and that's it I am NOT I just I'm a

4339.989 --> 4344.16
I'm a fine taster that's how I see

4342.03 --> 4347.91
myself I'm a music fine taster I have a

4344.16 --> 4351.54
very good sharp hearing I have feeling

4347.91 --> 4354.75
for harmonics and I love good melody

4351.54 --> 4357.33
like music and you really get me going

4354.75 --> 4360.81
and I'm very critical about it but to

4357.33 --> 4364.5599999999995
make it myself it's just it's very tough

4360.81 --> 4367.320000000001
but I love being I love getting myself

4364.56 --> 4368.910000000001
involved with design once you get into

4367.32 --> 4372.69
it like when you're putting together

4368.91 --> 4376.62
your first little five seconds

4372.69 --> 4379.949
instrumental you lose yourself in that

4376.62 --> 4381.87
five seconds I know I'm putting my first

4379.949 --> 4384.96
little piece together I have like I have

4381.87 --> 4388.05
like a track guru on my phone and I just

4384.96 --> 4390.2300000000005
sit back and I'll just at work I'm just

4388.05 --> 4392.85
putting together a five little

4390.23 --> 4395.58
five-second a little hit I call them

4392.85 --> 4397.9490000000005
little hits because I can I can rap to

4395.58 --> 4400.949
them sing to them rock and roll to them

4397.949 --> 4405.599999999999
anything I do I do anything I'm wild he

4400.949 --> 4406.29
was musically creative you know I always

4405.6 --> 4407.9890000000005
do that

4406.29 --> 4410.07
when I'm listening to good music I

4407.989 --> 4411.69
figure out okay where is the

4410.07 --> 4414.9
maneuverability and then I start singing

4411.69 --> 4417.87
along yeah you were watching a freaking

4414.9 --> 4421.349999999999

4849.35 --> 4855.4400000000005
when was this livestream that was large

4853.409 --> 4858.21
during that day yeah huh

4855.44 --> 4860.969
okay well then somebody probably just

4858.21 --> 4864.03
put it out in the what is a master be

4860.969 --> 4866.01
chat or something or some skype room

4864.03 --> 4869.79
yeah there were so many Skype rooms and

4866.01 --> 4872.13
I just clicked it I think so the memory

4869.79 --> 4878.07
is now starting to get back I think that

4872.13 --> 4880.83
was pretty random or maybe it was

4878.07 --> 4882.84
because I just pretty much reviewed that

4880.83 --> 4885.449
I used to be into that kind of stuff

4882.84 --> 4890.9890000000005
so everybody's linking me up like oh

4885.449 --> 4890.989
yeah be the black metal guy know right

4894.11 --> 4909.42
yeah now I'm just not into that anymore

4901.949 --> 4912.629999999999
I do get it but there's just a lot of

4909.42 --> 4915.53
people also walking through that better

4912.63 --> 4919.1990000000005
quite delusional or that get delusional

4915.53 --> 4921.989
man that's that's music you want you

4919.199 --> 4924.96
listen to when you're like drinking

4921.989 --> 4929.449
ayahuasca or something I wouldn't

4924.96 --> 4929.449
recommend it that would be quite insane

4930.29 --> 4937.139
that's gonna bring it to some creepy

4932.67 --> 4940.32
places to do drug I tried

4937.139 --> 4945.3
no no it was basically poisoned with it

4940.32 --> 4952.07
in voluntarily so what that's like the

4945.3 --> 4954.84
god drug bro they thought it was funny

4952.07 --> 4956.099999999999
you must have freaked out somebody

4954.84 --> 4958.02
jumped out of a window drinking that

4956.1 --> 4959.9400000000005
crap but it's like the gods were cause

4958.02 --> 4962.159000000001
it has your loosen eight that makes you

4959.94 --> 4964.0199999999995
see I've never tried it but I watched

4962.159 --> 4966.03
now you literally get launched into the

4964.02 --> 4968.25
other dimension and if you're not

4966.03 --> 4970.8
prepared you're [ __ ] because the the

4968.25 --> 4975.56
other spirits from there gonna come

4970.8 --> 4975.56
after you did

4977.8 --> 4983.93
and that resulted in divisions that

4981.95 --> 4985.94
while it's part of it because I have

4983.93 --> 4994.22
added before I didn't even know what it

4985.94 --> 4998.45
was and weird stuff very very weird but

4994.22 --> 5003.400000000001
I never like took ayahuasca like yeah

4998.45 --> 5006.37
I'm gonna do this like a drug I don't

5003.4 --> 5009.4
know for me it's always been associated

5006.37 --> 5019.59
with like in initiations and things and

5009.4 --> 5019.589999999999
I just the stuff is just dangerous I

5021.36 --> 5026.08
want to try it one day though well be

5024.49 --> 5028.75
sure to do it in a very controlled

5026.08 --> 5030.87
environment and realize that you're

5028.75 --> 5035.34
potentially but you're potentially

5030.87 --> 5040.42
launching yourself into a very dangerous

5035.34 --> 5043.08
adventure because it's it's all tied in

5040.42 --> 5048.43
with the world you know that dimension

5043.08 --> 5050.44
that's tied in with everything all the

5048.43 --> 5052.33
[ __ ] ring that's out there is it yours

5050.44 --> 5056.62
you're going to be exposed you could be

5052.33 --> 5061.0599999999995
exposed to everything out there if you

5056.62 --> 5063.3099999999995
know hmm I know I'm a lucid dreamer or I

5061.06 --> 5065.8
have night terrors or I dream very

5063.31 --> 5068.080000000001
deeply I can remember my dreams can my

5065.8 --> 5071.41
dream tell me hey Rick this is a dream

5068.08 --> 5074.38
bro this is a dream don't don't believe

5071.41 --> 5076.03
nothing just follow along with it you

5074.38 --> 5082.96
know figure out what's going on in there

5076.03 --> 5086.38
I dream I dream very deeply well in my

5082.96 --> 5088.51
dreams I still sometimes it's not even

5086.38 --> 5090.7300000000005
that focused because literally when my

5088.51 --> 5091.06
conscious notices I'm going getting

5090.73 --> 5094.8099999999995
there

5091.06 --> 5096.610000000001
it's prioritizes to just get away as

5094.81 --> 5098.530000000001
quickly as possible not in a panic but

5096.61 --> 5102.79
just to not get involved that kind of

5098.53 --> 5106.66
thing but sometimes in my dreams even in

5102.79 --> 5108.429
the last few weeks sometimes I just step

5106.66 --> 5110.769
from my dream back

5108.429 --> 5113.11
into the dark world for a moment just a

5110.769 --> 5117.55
snip of it and just recognize yeah this

5113.11 --> 5122.199
is where I was during that trip so I'm

5117.55 --> 5124.809
like stepping back in from a more

5122.199 --> 5133.138999999999
earthly based angle as it were instead

5124.809 --> 5135.639
of just being throughout time you do

5133.139 --> 5140.229
like I said my dreams are so vivid that

5135.639 --> 5142.09
I I remembered them you know you're not

5140.229 --> 5143.38
supposed to remember your dreams either

5142.09 --> 5145.179
you're not getting enough sleep or

5143.38 --> 5146.889
you're sleeping if you if you remember

5145.179 --> 5149.639
your dreams if you're not getting enough

5146.889 --> 5152.979
sleep you know my dream has told me that

5149.639 --> 5155.11
you know and if you're if you're

5152.979 --> 5156.34
sleeping good you don't remember your

5155.11 --> 5157.719
dreams because there's so many of them

5156.34 --> 5160.059
going by real fast

5157.719 --> 5162.249
they're like thirty five dreams at one

5160.059 --> 5166.03
time just bombarding you with dreams

5162.249 --> 5169.329
right you know well with me it's very

5166.03 --> 5171.009999999999
weird because it is said you know and

5169.329 --> 5173.799999999999
this is well it's pretty well

5171.01 --> 5175.09
established that dreams tend to confront

5173.8 --> 5178.019
you with things that are unresolved

5175.09 --> 5180.67
right that's the general approach and

5178.019 --> 5185.019
the weird thing is is that in my dreams

5180.67 --> 5187.78
sometimes I do get that I get like dream

5185.019 --> 5191.38
rewards for things that are obviously

5187.78 --> 5197.259999999999
not on the way but at the same time I

5191.38 --> 5199.51
also almost blatantly don't get these

5197.26 --> 5202.530000000001
things and it's like dangled in front of

5199.51 --> 5205.179
me with this weird saying like yeah

5202.53 --> 5207.909
don't be so complaining about it because

5205.179 --> 5210.01
it's gonna come soon enough that is very

5207.909 --> 5212.32
weird when I experienced that and it

5210.01 --> 5215.289000000001
also reflects back in saying yeah I'm

5212.32 --> 5218.289
not in a hurry to to like break out or

5215.289 --> 5219.67
anything and overstep my borders to get

5218.289 --> 5222.13
somewhere in a hurry because it

5219.67 --> 5225.4890000000005
literally feels and it's reflected in my

5222.13 --> 5231.459
dreams everything you need is gonna

5225.489 --> 5234.428999999999
arrive soon enough like I said mark yeah

5231.459 --> 5237.19
then my tears do suck girl I hate my

5234.429 --> 5239.8
dreams because I can't remember them

5237.19 --> 5242.2
and then they wake me up in a panic you

5239.8 --> 5245.16
know so I'm sitting there like well that

5242.2 --> 5249.0599999999995
a dream was that real you know oh [ __ ]

5245.16 --> 5252.28
no no wake up I'll realize the dream I

5249.06 --> 5253.93
don't have that anymore I've never

5252.28 --> 5256.57
experienced a dream where it wasn't

5253.93 --> 5260.200000000001
under control and I stopped smoking

5256.57 --> 5266.41
marijuana and now I'm having these my

5260.2 --> 5269.11
mind's wandering I'm a very deep thinker

5266.41 --> 5270.78
so my mind wants to solve something at

5269.11 --> 5275.0199999999995
all times

5270.78 --> 5276.96
hmm my mind wants like better my mind is

5275.02 --> 5278.9800000000005
trying to solve every bit of Flat Earth

5276.96 --> 5281.2
I'm trying to figure it out I'm trying

5278.98 --> 5283.299999999999
I'm trying to figure out what's going on

5281.2 --> 5285.79
what's the moving about what are we into

5283.3 --> 5288.58
you know even we've been indoctrinated

5285.79 --> 5291.73
so long I don't even know what's real or

5288.58 --> 5294.01
fake you don't well that's a problem

5291.73 --> 5295.57
with when we've been a doctrine in it

5294.01 --> 5297.55
man you got to figure out again it's

5295.57 --> 5301.0599999999995
like a baby step you get back into your

5297.55 --> 5302.860000000001
baby step mold and and go into okay

5301.06 --> 5305.110000000001
I've been indoctrinated I've been taught

5302.86 --> 5306.67
all this crap that ain't true how do I

5305.11 --> 5308.17
break that forget it

5306.67 --> 5311.58
then you got to forget all that stuff

5308.17 --> 5315.55
now you gotta say okay I'm a baby again

5311.58 --> 5321.07
what do I have to learn you know really

5315.55 --> 5324.85
what do I have to do yeah no I don't do

5321.07 --> 5328.42
that no I don't really know though I

5324.85 --> 5331.18
just figure out what was actual and

5328.42 --> 5334.0
where my belief filled it in and then I

5331.18 --> 5339.700000000001
undo that and then I let it fill in

5334.0 --> 5342.91
naturally all these moments were you or

5339.7 --> 5346.03
where I remember just accepting the

5342.91 --> 5351.04
story because from the inside the

5346.03 --> 5352.63
dreamer wanted that and that was what's

5351.04 --> 5354.82
supposed to happen like the person

5352.63 --> 5357.22
sharing that with me that was his

5354.82 --> 5360.3099999999995
intention to make me believe to make me

5357.22 --> 5362.02
enjoy that dream and that's what I

5360.31 --> 5364.410000000001
really that's not unlearning it's

5362.02 --> 5368.200000000001
literally going through it again and

5364.41 --> 5371.41
realized why it went the way it did

5368.2 --> 5373.69
it's transcending the very structure

5371.41 --> 5379.45
that allowed that to manifest in the

5373.69 --> 5383.53
first place it's like a it's like a

5379.45 --> 5386.59
lawyer mind approach to it all yes I

5383.53 --> 5388.84
hate it I hate my mind that's one thing

5386.59 --> 5391.0
I can't stand my I can't dance I can't

5388.84 --> 5393.34
stand my thoughts because like I said

5391.0 --> 5395.29
I'm always trying to solve something I'm

5393.34 --> 5400.21
always trying to figure it out deeper I

5395.29 --> 5402.01
go I go like I go into it and try to

5400.21 --> 5404.35
figure it out try to figure out what's

5402.01 --> 5407.59
going on before I can believe what's

5404.35 --> 5409.360000000001
going on right no like if and Flat Earth

5407.59 --> 5411.97
if I didn't do a lot of experiments on

5409.36 --> 5413.259999999999
my own I wouldn't believe this crap if I

5411.97 --> 5416.110000000001
wasn't doing spirit level tests on

5413.26 --> 5420.13
airplanes or if I wasn't doing curvature

5416.11 --> 5422.349999999999
test through p900 bringing the boat back

5420.13 --> 5424.12
I mean I wouldn't believe that crap I

5422.35 --> 5427.21
would believe a same thing bill nine

5424.12 --> 5429.34
[ __ ] Neil deGrasse taught me hey if

5427.21 --> 5432.88
it goes over the over over the horizon

5429.34 --> 5436.03
it's going over the curve yeah but at

5432.88 --> 5438.49
the same time we can't go far away

5436.03 --> 5441.219999999999
enough in general in order to see the

5438.49 --> 5443.83
actual curve but when we stand on the

5441.22 --> 5445.51
ground we can still see the curve that

5443.83 --> 5448.33
seems to be the biggest problem now is

5445.51 --> 5450.76
that all the upholders of the arguments

5448.33 --> 5456.07
for the earth to be able are literally

5450.76 --> 5458.4400000000005
now all breaking the narrative into and

5456.07 --> 5461.2
star double speaking about it openly

5458.44 --> 5463.15
we'll never see the curve unless yeah

5461.2 --> 5465.01
but you will you will never see the

5463.15 --> 5466.9
curve but you always will

5465.01 --> 5471.99
that's now the argument just like the

5466.9 --> 5474.46
Coriolis because we are too small and

5471.99 --> 5477.66
the curve is so far away unless you

5474.46 --> 5481.78
unless we can actually see two or three

5477.66 --> 5484.75
two or three thousand miles away with

5481.78 --> 5486.929999999999
our vision in our perspective a vision

5484.75 --> 5491.71
then when I got never see the curve grow

5486.93 --> 5493.06
too far well imagine the curve let's see

5491.71 --> 5495.46
that's what that's what ballers do they

5493.06 --> 5499.120000000001
imagine the curve yeah oh it's right

5495.46 --> 5500.77
there it's right there look at it see

5499.12 --> 5501.399
that see there's a rising line you see

5500.77 --> 5505.9890000000005
it

5501.399 --> 5509.769
that's the curve right there please you

5505.989 --> 5511.898999999999
can't see no curvature and your eyes as

5509.769 --> 5513.369000000001
can see I just can't distinct what you

5511.899 --> 5519.129
steam your eyes plays tricks on your

5513.369 --> 5521.169
eyes aren't your eyes on to see what

5519.129 --> 5523.449
they are no no your eyes are not

5521.169 --> 5527.8
tricking you it is the mind that is

5523.449 --> 5530.799999999999
treating you tricking you with what your

5527.8 --> 5533.679
eyes are presenting to you yes it's the

5530.8 --> 5536.919
mind that tricks not the eyes yes

5533.679 --> 5539.229
because your eyes want to your your mind

5536.919 --> 5541.749
wants to figure out what you think your

5539.229 --> 5544.169
mind wants to make what is seen tangible

5541.749 --> 5547.478999999999
tangible and it's literal and

5544.169 --> 5549.789
geometrically physical as it can yes

5547.479 --> 5553.929
that's the first response to make it

5549.789 --> 5559.659
more consumable for the ego for the mind

5553.929 --> 5564.849
I wish mine wouldn't do that well you

5559.659 --> 5568.239
can unlearn that no well by realizing it

5564.849 --> 5571.869000000001
first and then literally as you're doing

5568.239 --> 5574.148999999999
it negating the process it's like oh

5571.869 --> 5576.249
what I did originally to figure out the

5574.149 --> 5578.139
optical slant I just look at the picture

5576.249 --> 5579.34
now of course you're gonna see it your

5578.139 --> 5581.019
mind's gonna tell you yeah that's

5579.34 --> 5582.309
supposedly the curve that's supposedly

5581.019 --> 5585.399
the curve as you're looking it it's not

5582.309 --> 5588.669
even an active thing then you realize

5585.399 --> 5590.05
wait as I'm looking my mind is literally

5588.669 --> 5593.769
at the same time in the background

5590.05 --> 5598.03
telling that's supposedly a curve so

5593.769 --> 5600.669
then just say zip no clean there is

5598.03 --> 5602.949
literally nothing said it's just turn

5600.669 --> 5606.699
off that frequency and just look and

5602.949 --> 5609.789
just look and almost like a scanner

5606.699 --> 5612.57
laser your let your eyes just literally

5609.789 --> 5616.719
take it up literally scan it and no

5612.57 --> 5618.34
interpretations and then after you've

5616.719 --> 5622.479
completed that process and let

5618.34 --> 5626.889
everything sink in as it is then go over

5622.479 --> 5630.969
with it with your mind okay that's how I

5626.889 --> 5633.389
do it and do the programming and then do

5630.969 --> 5633.389
it again

5633.5 --> 5639.98
I gotta do that because like I said my

5635.57 --> 5642.92
mind is so wired so wide like this thing

5639.98 --> 5646.429999999999
I see it and then my mind says that's a

5642.92 --> 5648.5
boat how do you know that's a boat you

5646.43 --> 5650.21
just determined that was a boat oh yeah

5648.5 --> 5652.76
it could be a car oh you determinate

5650.21 --> 5656.54
look at what is available and then you

5652.76 --> 5659.18
see the what is it the person the most

5656.54 --> 5664.13
the percentage of likelihood that that

5659.18 --> 5668.0
will turn out to be a certain thing so

5664.13 --> 5669.74
it's all just gauging the chance what

5668.0 --> 5671.6
you get to observe and then your mind

5669.74 --> 5673.25
quickly starts to puzzle okay what could

5671.6 --> 5676.570000000001
be the pieces that are missing how am i

5673.25 --> 5684.05
interpreting this is one thing it's all

5676.57 --> 5687.19
prediction I could just stop thinking so

5684.05 --> 5693.04
much and then trying to solve it right

5687.19 --> 5695.7699999999995
then I can probably break out of the the

5693.04 --> 5700.31
indoctrination part because like I said

5695.77 --> 5702.68
my mind wants to fall right you know and

5700.31 --> 5706.04
and when it's doing that to solve it

5702.68 --> 5707.72
right and as it is doing that it is

5706.04 --> 5710.42
distracting you from what you're

5707.72 --> 5712.97
actually seeing from the details because

5710.42 --> 5717.41
it's filling in already some of the

5712.97 --> 5719.990000000001
details because of the interpretation so

5717.41 --> 5723.7699999999995
you miss details little out of place

5719.99 --> 5725.57
things kind of okay that's how far lands

5723.77 --> 5729.320000000001
without definitely like I said a thing

5725.57 --> 5732.83
right now that I can do to understand

5729.32 --> 5735.95
more you know I don't want to understand

5732.83 --> 5738.68
all that's gonna stand more things I'm a

5735.95 --> 5740.75
very smart person that's just my mind

5738.68 --> 5745.52
wants to dictate how smart I am

5740.75 --> 5748.55
oh dear oh that's not that that's not

5745.52 --> 5752.96
really good on the long run for yourself

5748.55 --> 5756.17
I can speak out of experience my mind

5752.96 --> 5758.39
want to tell me oh oh that's not right

5756.17 --> 5759.95
you fall you fall in the wrong path

5758.39 --> 5762.320000000001
you're doing the wrong thing oh my god

5759.95 --> 5765.438999999999
James what are you doing you know so is

5762.32 --> 5770.329
this it keeps me this okay

5765.439 --> 5773.389
you mean fear for mistakes no I like

5770.329 --> 5775.489
mistakes okay fix me better then why

5773.389 --> 5778.519
would you be telling why would your mind

5775.489 --> 5782.589999999999
tell you you're doing it wrong because

5778.519 --> 5785.329000000001
my I told you my mind thinks it's well I

5782.59 --> 5789.8
have multiple personality disorder

5785.329 --> 5793.669
ready so my mind think so my mind my

5789.8 --> 5795.110000000001
mind is my mind so I I call him that you

5793.669 --> 5797.809
see how I do him in the whole nother

5795.11 --> 5800.179
category of his own so he has his own

5797.809 --> 5802.6990000000005
thoughts and processing and then there's

5800.179 --> 5804.769
me I have my own thoughts in processing

5802.699 --> 5806.509999999999
and then he's sitting there nope no

5804.769 --> 5809.719
that's not that's not that's not what I

5806.51 --> 5812.3
thought right I think you mean yeah yeah

5809.719 --> 5814.669
it's it's a compartmentalization effect

5812.3 --> 5817.039
and they can start to live their own

5814.669 --> 5820.34
lives if they're just fed enough I had

5817.039 --> 5823.429
that issue but I got a strict discipline

5820.34 --> 5827.599
over every faculty that my character

5823.429 --> 5830.269
consists of now but I'm doing now I'm

5827.599 --> 5832.459
trying to work out that mm things right

5830.269 --> 5836.329000000001
there so I could get my mind to actually

5832.459 --> 5838.699
join me as one so we can both you know

5836.329 --> 5841.518999999999
instead of my mind thing no don't walk

5838.699 --> 5843.259999999999
that way come on it's like my mind sees

5841.519 --> 5845.469
the feature or something it's like my

5843.26 --> 5848.539000000001
mind my mind knows was around the corner

5845.469 --> 5851.2390000000005
before I'm around the corner don't go

5848.539 --> 5853.429
over there it's gonna be danger and then

5851.239 --> 5858.129999999999
you hear shooting over there I'm like oh

5853.429 --> 5859.34
[ __ ] my mind's right go that way so

5858.13 --> 5864.769
crazy

5859.34 --> 5866.749
alright well hey look there are there

5864.769 --> 5868.999
are many faculties about the mind

5866.749 --> 5872.03
besides the actual experiencing

5868.999 --> 5874.07
consciousness that can actually tap very

5872.03 --> 5876.889
reliably so without your conscious

5874.07 --> 5883.849
knowing it into the subconscious that

5876.889 --> 5886.789
has a how do you say a sensory element

5883.849 --> 5889.849
that transcends time there the

5886.789 --> 5893.599
subconscious and this barely even

5889.849 --> 5896.63
disputable at this point it can see into

5893.599 --> 5899.3
the future with most people with most

5896.63 --> 5902.63
people and your mind if

5899.3 --> 5905.650000000001
very trained very active can actually or

5902.63 --> 5908.9890000000005
other parts of you can see things coming

5905.65 --> 5911.329
and your consciousness will simply take

5908.989 --> 5913.759999999999
note of that another part of you is

5911.329 --> 5920.449
sensing this and then choose to go with

5913.76 --> 5921.29
it or not my money what to do my mind

5920.449 --> 5923.15
tells me what to do

5921.29 --> 5925.19
so my mind that's why he's another

5923.15 --> 5927.619
person that's how I look at him he's a

5925.19 --> 5931.388999999999
hold of the person he's like my buddy

5927.619 --> 5934.489
that is more knowledgeable than me

5931.389 --> 5935.179
playing if he tells me to do what would

5934.489 --> 5938.419999999999
you do that

5935.179 --> 5940.88
your mind is yours he's not

5938.42 --> 5942.679
that's no your mind was not smarter than

5940.88 --> 5945.619
you

5942.679 --> 5948.219
for from my point of view I think that

5945.619 --> 5950.69
my mind collects he does his own thing

5948.219 --> 5953.3
he does his own thing he thinks his own

5950.69 --> 5954.86
thoughts I can't tell it what to do

5953.3 --> 5958.52
he's telling me what to all the time I

5954.86 --> 5960.429
can't tell my mind hey don't walk around

5958.52 --> 5962.869000000001
that corner because my mind is my body

5960.429 --> 5965.03
part of me so I can't tell him not to

5962.869 --> 5967.25
walk around the corner so he's saying

5965.03 --> 5970.04
hey don't walk around there don't do

5967.25 --> 5972.32
this don't do that you know like my

5970.04 --> 5977.21
first gun flutter my mind was like on a

5972.32 --> 5980.03
rant for like about six months what are

5977.21 --> 5982.94
you doing you stupid you drink a bottle

5980.03 --> 5987.409
of bleach oh my god you're into this Oh

5982.94 --> 5989.058999999999
Lord let's figure it out it's weird it's

5987.409 --> 5994.61
weird that you call that your mind I

5989.059 --> 5997.369000000001
really call that the ego hmm the ego is

5994.61 --> 6000.009999999999
an impulsive factor that can take

5997.369 --> 6002.32
control of faculties and the mind is

6000.01 --> 6006.4490000000005
usually where the ego arrives the first

6002.32 --> 6010.889
that's the first place it can do schemes

6006.449 --> 6014.379999999999
work for the ego that's through the mind

6010.889 --> 6016.63
that's where it arrives the six-year-old

6014.38 --> 6020.4890000000005
finds out that he can abuse his

6016.63 --> 6023.88
cognitive things to get done

6020.489 --> 6023.879999999999
that's the mind

6024.07 --> 6029.44
I think think about it ego because one

6027.13 --> 6031.809
happy on an ego trip you know I don't

6029.44 --> 6033.129
want to have that in my mind that you

6031.809 --> 6036.519
know my mind don't think of me

6033.129 --> 6038.199
my mind thinks you're you and on me well

6036.519 --> 6041.9490000000005
that's fascinating because the very

6038.199 --> 6046.348999999999
element of the ego is that it's a claim

6041.949 --> 6050.259999999999
of separation from everything else so

6046.349 --> 6052.57
literally your ego is using your mind to

6050.26 --> 6055.809
try to convince you that it is separate

6052.57 --> 6059.889
from you but that is a lie and that lie

6055.809 --> 6061.959
is at the very core of its existence as

6059.889 --> 6068.379
a manifestation separate from your

6061.959 --> 6071.26
consciousness it's a trick are you doing

6068.379 --> 6074.139
a good job of it I could say all right

6071.26 --> 6076.829000000001
you can work of it on it it's kind of

6074.139 --> 6079.229
like treating social justice for your

6076.829 --> 6083.679
attention grabber you panic attack

6079.229 --> 6087.369000000001
people drown out the noise don't let it

6083.679 --> 6091.32
make its noise and take over the

6087.369 --> 6094.808999999999
atmosphere within you or outside of you

6091.32 --> 6095.938999999999
make him stand make it stand in line say

6094.809 --> 6098.409000000001
nope

6095.939 --> 6102.369000000001
yeah you have all that you can do all

6098.409 --> 6106.209
that but you got to do it for me not for

6102.369 --> 6109.598999999999
you he does it for himself bro he he he

6106.209 --> 6113.01
so he's so above and beyond like I said

6109.599 --> 6116.9490000000005
when I say my mind my mind in the space

6113.01 --> 6119.8
my mind can see into space so my mind

6116.949 --> 6122.07
says well this is as far as I can go I'm

6119.8 --> 6124.479
looking I'm looking

6122.07 --> 6126.82
could I be asking questions why he's up

6124.479 --> 6129.659000000001
there I'm like okay what do you see when

6126.82 --> 6134.259999999999
cities either you see the earth I see

6129.659 --> 6135.598999999999
darkness I don't see where these planets

6134.26 --> 6139.7390000000005
are I see lights

6135.599 --> 6143.7390000000005
you know my mind don't actually dwell

6139.739 --> 6146.1089999999995
farther into where it's supposed to go

6143.739 --> 6149.438999999999
cuz I'm trying to find out so I sent it

6146.109 --> 6153.419000000001
out go go find out this go find out

6149.439 --> 6157.629
that's literally all virtual

6153.419 --> 6161.369
that's your visual imagination that your

6157.629 --> 6166.239
reasoning capacity is using to simulate

6161.369 --> 6169.66
exploring something real but that's not

6166.239 --> 6173.41
that that is super flexible that could

6169.66 --> 6175.15
give you whatever you're at where you're

6173.41 --> 6178.3
at with your development it could

6175.15 --> 6183.79
present whatever to you that's not real

6178.3 --> 6187.51
sorry this sounds kind of weird but it

6183.79 --> 6189.31
seems well it seems real it's only gonna

6187.51 --> 6191.8
be a reflection back of the

6189.31 --> 6193.75
preponderance of all information you've

6191.8 --> 6195.1900000000005
gathered so far in the conclusions where

6193.75 --> 6197.56
you're at that's is what it's going to

6195.19 --> 6199.989
reflect that's literally the imagination

6197.56 --> 6202.27
when you integrate it you just see it

6199.989 --> 6204.82
it's not a separate process somebody is

6202.27 --> 6207.46
doing for you no you're the one doing

6204.82 --> 6214.389999999999
that that's the integration of the ego

6207.46 --> 6217.42
with the conscious right or you just let

6214.39 --> 6221.71
go of the racks of those ego behaviors

6217.42 --> 6224.8
and just unified with yourself take some

6221.71 --> 6226.9890000000005
time I'm sorry this discussion is really

6224.8 --> 6229.6900000000005
weird I'm so sorry

6226.989 --> 6232.389999999999
like I said I'm my first time on the

6229.69 --> 6235.839999999999
panel yeah it is kind of weird yeah you

6232.39 --> 6237.58
don't worry about it you threw out quite

6235.84 --> 6240.219
a lot about yourself right on the spot

6237.58 --> 6242.0199999999995
that it's gonna definitely bring out a

6240.219 --> 6248.26
lot of red flags with certain type of

6242.02 --> 6255.52
people as we all know you know well it

6248.26 --> 6257.2
is kind of weird to say that it's kind

6255.52 --> 6260.469
of a weird to say in public that's more

6257.2 --> 6262.78
it but hey everybody has especially

6260.469 --> 6266.11
intelligent people do typically have

6262.78 --> 6271.03
these types of issues that their

6266.11 --> 6273.7
capacities their mental capacities that

6271.03 --> 6275.53
they don't really find reach from within

6273.7 --> 6279.25
the consciousness to grasp it oh and

6275.53 --> 6283.719
then almost out of boredom the ego will

6279.25 --> 6286.0
take control of them and then that

6283.719 --> 6289.0
happens naturally to intelligent people

6286.0 --> 6291.219
almost every really intelligent teenager

6289.0 --> 6292.66
goes through that kind of [ __ ] where

6291.219 --> 6294.969
they start to behave like they're

6292.66 --> 6297.13
possessed because that's what that is

6294.969 --> 6299.38
it's the ego it's the ego taking control

6297.13 --> 6302.59
of the faculties because the call

6299.38 --> 6304.78
just in this can't grasp it what it has

6302.59 --> 6310.03
its own skills and then the ego takes

6304.78 --> 6313.24
over huh and then it's yeah learning the

6310.03 --> 6316.45
lessons and see well I look into more of

6313.24 --> 6319.96
my ego because I've never dwelt into

6316.45 --> 6322.54
that part of the of my of my psyche or

6319.96 --> 6326.14
my mind I just thought I was I thought

6322.54 --> 6329.86
that I thought my mind was a separate

6326.14 --> 6332.410000000001
person or a separate entity not a person

6329.86 --> 6340.36
but a separate entity and its own that

6332.41 --> 6343.0
it guides me I can try to but it is but

6340.36 --> 6347.17
it doesn't need to be separate of you it

6343.0 --> 6350.14
can literally just be a part of you you

6347.17 --> 6354.13
and if I don't know what I'm cause this

6350.14 --> 6356.56
condition I'm fighting it to bring it to

6354.13 --> 6359.77
me maybe that's what because he's been

6356.56 --> 6362.14
so he's been so long on his own teaching

6359.77 --> 6364.900000000001
me because I that's what for me I was

6362.14 --> 6370.17
doing this teaching me you know not

6364.9 --> 6374.08
letting me not letting me be blind to

6370.17 --> 6376.12
knowledge so like I said I listen to a

6374.08 --> 6377.7699999999995
lot of stuff I step nice to be part of

6376.12 --> 6380.68
the cosmos with Neil grant Neil deGrasse

6377.77 --> 6383.8
Tyson nice to be part of all of Bill's

6380.68 --> 6385.12
knives the hangouts when they were back

6383.8 --> 6389.8
in the days when they were when they

6385.12 --> 6392.67
were not hangouts I mean II a man it was

6389.8 --> 6397.24
crazy so you're a real fan back then and

6392.67 --> 6398.71
participant to know what space I want to

6397.24 --> 6401.73
know what the universe was about I

6398.71 --> 6404.44
wondered well into space I have so many

6401.73 --> 6408.07
have a whole collection on my computer

6404.44 --> 6409.95
of all the cosmos episodes I some watch

6408.07 --> 6413.86
them over and over them to figure out

6409.95 --> 6416.47
you know where we lived we're going you

6413.86 --> 6419.349999999999
know what what's going on out there you

6416.47 --> 6422.14
know cuz it when you look up that's all

6419.35 --> 6423.64
you're doing that's looking up you know

6422.14 --> 6425.92
and then your imagination takes over

6423.64 --> 6427.6
then you gotta imagine what's up there

6425.92 --> 6428.9800000000005
cuz we never been there we never

6427.6 --> 6432.110000000001
actually been there ourselves

6428.98 --> 6434.36
so for us we have to imagine what

6432.11 --> 6436.25
yeah like you were saying you know our

6434.36 --> 6439.13
imagination takes over so deeply that

6436.25 --> 6444.23
you start imagining I've seen I've seen

6439.13 --> 6445.58
Pluto from what the cosmos told me I've

6444.23 --> 6445.91
seen all his crap but they were telling

6445.58 --> 6448.25
me

6445.91 --> 6451.76
but then after I'm like wait a minute

6448.25 --> 6456.2
man am I really am I really seeing this

6451.76 --> 6458.93
or am i lying is this real mm-hmm cuz

6456.2 --> 6462.679999999999
Noah good he'd be a god to me used to be

6458.93 --> 6465.35
like a mini deity to me where I would

6462.68 --> 6467.39
listen to that crap over and over and

6465.35 --> 6470.54
over and put it in my mind in my mind

6467.39 --> 6471.4400000000005
look like rejected like you do it you

6470.54 --> 6473.54
that's stupid

6471.44 --> 6476.599999999999
have you in alliance with have you been

6473.54 --> 6478.69
there have you been there I can't I

6476.6 --> 6482.93
can't even go there have you been there

6478.69 --> 6485.929999999999
I'm like no but I know the grass has

6482.93 --> 6487.820000000001
yeah no he hasn't he hasn't been there

6485.93 --> 6489.25
but what what do you think he's talking

6487.82 --> 6492.23
about it all the time he's been there

6489.25 --> 6493.37
what I thought I what from when I was

6492.23 --> 6496.839999999999
when I was listening to the stuff I

6493.37 --> 6498.7699999999995
thought he was in space I'm damn where I

6496.84 --> 6500.75
thought he'd been everywhere I thought

6498.77 --> 6506.240000000001
he was like a mind a traveler in space I

6500.75 --> 6508.52
thought he was like Star Trek right like

6506.24 --> 6514.01
he would be part of the Men in Black

6508.52 --> 6518.06
team that would kind of like go open to

6514.01 --> 6520.64
the earthers a little bit more yes yeah

6518.06 --> 6524.84
where I'm here to declassify the entire

6520.64 --> 6529.7300000000005
space Federation that's what I thought

6524.84 --> 6532.34
he was that guy for a long time he was

6529.73 --> 6534.919999999999
working for me but then I started

6532.34 --> 6536.0
thinking myself wait a minute has

6534.92 --> 6538.28
anybody been there

6536.0 --> 6540.86
besides these people these NASA folks

6538.28 --> 6543.429999999999
has anybody else been better to actually

6540.86 --> 6547.009999999999
tell you if this stuff is real I know

6543.43 --> 6548.93
well let's figure this out these are

6547.01 --> 6551.96
only 12 people that's been there let's

6548.93 --> 6554.96
figure this out okay let's figure it out

6551.96 --> 6558.35
then go ahead do you think I'm gonna sit

6554.96 --> 6560.21
here and watch you know and then my mind

6558.35 --> 6563.72
goes into a tangent trying to figure out

6560.21 --> 6564.72
NASA hold whole conspiracy of NASA you

6563.72 --> 6566.37
know and pee

6564.72 --> 6567.990000000001
we'll say yeah why would they lie to you

6566.37 --> 6571.44
man if I was getting that much money I

6567.99 --> 6573.389999999999
would lie to everybody - I'm just doing

6571.44 --> 6575.91
a job and people to understand that

6573.39 --> 6578.3
these people are doing jobs they don't

6575.91 --> 6580.68
know one hand that wants to be other

6578.3 --> 6581.25
there's an instrument and never been to

6580.68 --> 6583.35
space

6581.25 --> 6585.47
you just look at instruments you're

6583.35 --> 6590.31
looking at you looking at a chart or oh

6585.47 --> 6593.16
it's all finished finals performed by a

6590.31 --> 6594.81
handful of people mm-hmm everything is

6593.16 --> 6596.22
on a need-to-know basis and that's how

6594.81 --> 6597.84
they pull it off and that's how they

6596.22 --> 6600.780000000001
draw the giant budgets and then they

6597.84 --> 6603.21
have all these puppet people working on

6600.78 --> 6606.15
nonsense to show for a look we have all

6603.21 --> 6606.96
these people working see it is money

6606.15 --> 6608.91
well spent

6606.96 --> 6610.56
well these people aren't even really

6608.91 --> 6615.59
part of the whole system that's just

6610.56 --> 6618.81
busying therapy yes that's all it is

6615.59 --> 6621.03
that's all it is like I said I I see

6618.81 --> 6623.070000000001
this stuff now you know like I said you

6621.03 --> 6626.34
know being part of the being part of

6623.07 --> 6628.41
this side of the earth is different than

6626.34 --> 6631.29
being a baller mm-hmm because you

6628.41 --> 6632.67
believe everything right you know and

6631.29 --> 6634.71
you revel in whatever

6632.67 --> 6636.35
yeah you believe in you can you can you

6634.71 --> 6639.69
can regurgitate it back to other people

6636.35 --> 6644.34
when I'm talking about fire it's hard to

6639.69 --> 6647.3099999999995
regurgitate what I know I can I know a

6644.34 --> 6650.22
good tape that on the airplane we're not

6647.31 --> 6652.13
traveling around anything you know

6650.22 --> 6654.51
because of my spirit level test yeah

6652.13 --> 6656.7
okay this is the stuff I can tell people

6654.51 --> 6658.77
but I can't tell people yeah in space

6656.7 --> 6661.74
there's the Sun and there's the moon and

6658.77 --> 6663.96
there's that clamp in there I can look

6661.74 --> 6665.969999999999
at the moon you can go outside right now

6663.96 --> 6667.47
I tell my people all the time you can go

6665.97 --> 6671.34
outside right now whatever country

6667.47 --> 6676.320000000001
you're in glider dark and we'll see the

6671.34 --> 6677.01
same exact moon the same effect that's

6676.32 --> 6679.5
impossible

6677.01 --> 6681.54
mm-hmm that's impossible it's personally

6679.5 --> 6684.27
impossible to see the same thing at the

6681.54 --> 6686.13
same time even if it's lighter day you

6684.27 --> 6687.4800000000005
know there's a date moon so if I'm

6686.13 --> 6689.33
watching my night moon you're watching

6687.48 --> 6691.62
your day moon they're the same moon

6689.33 --> 6695.21
maybe yours has a crescent maybe mine

6691.62 --> 6695.21
doesn't but it's the same

6695.26 --> 6703.0
well you know well it just it's not

6698.59 --> 6706.83
consistent with with a yeah physical

6703.0 --> 6709.87
object rotating around us it's just the

6706.83 --> 6714.5199999999995
whole setup is almost consistent but

6709.87 --> 6715.93
just not entirely that's always it yeah

6714.52 --> 6717.85
it don't make no sense that's what the

6715.93 --> 6720.22
problem is I like things to make sense

6717.85 --> 6721.6900000000005
so I things to make like when I was down

6720.22 --> 6724.63
with Neil deGrasse Tyson things made

6721.69 --> 6727.33
sense because he would say it and in a

6724.63 --> 6730.93
way that made sense to them can you can

6727.33 --> 6733.48
regurgitate you can be like yes the moon

6730.93 --> 6735.13
is made we made a mouse way and we can

6733.48 --> 6737.65
go there yeah you know you can

6735.13 --> 6739.96
regurgitate this stuff you know that the

6737.65 --> 6743.349999999999
earth is this big and this is why you

6739.96 --> 6745.2300000000005
can't see it because we're so small you

6743.35 --> 6747.52
know I'm like okay that sounds awesome

6745.23 --> 6754.48
that's why I can't see the curve because

6747.52 --> 6756.700000000001
we're so small you know this is crazy

6754.48 --> 6758.379999999999
life to live man like I said I

6756.7 --> 6762.07
definitely want to get back into my mind

6758.38 --> 6764.68
to try to pull it over to me to where

6762.07 --> 6766.719999999999
we're both thinking this you know

6764.68 --> 6771.64
instead of him think in advance and I'm

6766.72 --> 6775.110000000001
thinking primitive look at it

6771.64 --> 6778.570000000001
alright I'll look a little deeper and

6775.11 --> 6781.299999999999
see how much your feelings can handle it

6778.57 --> 6783.549999999999
and then because the more you get closer

6781.3 --> 6785.7390000000005
to where the actual insight from your

6783.55 --> 6790.45
intellect is coming from the harsher

6785.739 --> 6793.03
things do tend to get and usually when

6790.45 --> 6795.82
there's a trouble with integration it's

6793.03 --> 6800.2
usually because the consciousness is

6795.82 --> 6803.44
trying to save yourself from feelings

6800.2 --> 6805.66
getting hurt so it could be like

6803.44 --> 6807.16
something you see coming but you just

6805.66 --> 6809.8
can't get there because you know it's

6807.16 --> 6814.63
gonna hurt you so you're not ready for

6809.8 --> 6818.08
it that could be also at the yeah at a

6814.63 --> 6819.46
root of it that I think you heard my

6818.08 --> 6824.4
wife she said she really enjoyed the

6819.46 --> 6824.4
show I get her into this crap too

6824.869 --> 6831.289
oh she can understand what's going what

6826.46 --> 6831.86
I'm into so she'll think I'm a freak not

6831.289 --> 6834.7699999999995
a freak

6831.86 --> 6836.989
don't worry so she listens to Nathan and

6834.77 --> 6840.889
she's that's hilarious to her she loves

6836.989 --> 6843.579
Nathan mm-hmm she's like this guy's

6840.889 --> 6843.579
crazy

6843.789 --> 6849.469
now he's like the ultimate school

6847.13 --> 6856.61
teacher off the old block before the

6849.469 --> 6858.92
blow yeah he pulled me off a lot of

6856.61 --> 6861.5
channels like I said I still watched era

6858.92 --> 6863.0
of course Marx Arjun don't do as much

6861.5 --> 6865.34
anymore but I still I still watch the

6863.0 --> 6869.03
stuff he do I miss Patricia know on our

6865.34 --> 6872.78
hiatus you know Mark Powell and I fell

6869.03 --> 6874.639
off of him a long time ago Eric Dubay he

6872.78 --> 6878.509999999999
was one of the first so I really got

6874.639 --> 6880.9890000000005
into that and 100-proof scrapped and I

6878.51 --> 6886.159000000001
really started welling into that and out

6880.989 --> 6889.089999999999
what this was that yeah he fell off yeah

6886.159 --> 6895.369
definitely has a lot of presumptions

6889.09 --> 6898.369000000001
then but as a video they were still kind

6895.369 --> 6901.789
of good it's a good intro video yes yes

6898.369 --> 6905.679
they were excellent getting my mind away

6901.789 --> 6908.75
from what I was talked mm-hm

6905.679 --> 6912.05
what something else what he successfully

6908.75 --> 6915.199
did with his Vanier overconfidence as it

6912.05 --> 6916.76
were is kind of break the overconfident

6915.199 --> 6919.638999999999
spell from the ballers that they were

6916.76 --> 6922.25
still wielding very effectively back at

6919.639 --> 6924.32
the start yeah and we're still like oh

6922.25 --> 6927.32
my god you're so stupid because we have

6924.32 --> 6929.98
oh look we can look this up and see the

6927.32 --> 6934.159
you are all crazy and loose and with his

6929.98 --> 6935.839999999999
sivanna overconfidence and his I was 200

6934.159 --> 6939.949
proofs what is it even though it's all

6935.84 --> 6943.4890000000005
not all perfect it still does give it

6939.949 --> 6946.098999999999
did give a good weapon to slap back at

6943.489 --> 6949.638999999999
the overconfidence from the ballers the

6946.099 --> 6952.7300000000005
kind of round of work to walk as you go

6949.639 --> 6955.88
so it did yeah I did it that was helpful

6952.73 --> 6957.82
and at the same time he also spent a

6955.88 --> 6960.83
huge amount of time just

6957.82 --> 6963.23
blatantly brutally attacking us all

6960.83 --> 6965.6
their flat earthers but yeah that's

6963.23 --> 6967.159
course I watched all that too I mean I

6965.6 --> 6969.620000000001
watch how you with attacking every flat

6967.159 --> 6972.7699999999995
earther I used to be very into Jake the

6969.62 --> 6975.3099999999995
[ __ ] at the time too when I figured

6972.77 --> 6978.5
out when I figured out he was just a

6975.31 --> 6981.79
follower that's all that's all Jake was

6978.5 --> 6984.59
the follower now not his own person I

6981.79 --> 6986.929
had to fall off of him all right Jake oh

6984.59 --> 6990.26
forgot about him oh yeah Jake Gibson

6986.929 --> 6993.71
yeah if he was he was awesome at the

6990.26 --> 6998.150000000001
time no he had an interesting character

6993.71 --> 7000.37
to present mm-hmm funny I can get into

6998.15 --> 7003.58
that you know I like being playing so I

7000.37 --> 7006.28
was very into watching funny stuff like

7003.58 --> 7007.0
that the way and they had music involved

7006.28 --> 7009.46
with it

7007.0 --> 7018.07
bring up the bass and go crazy with the

7009.46 --> 7019.69
bass and lip music it was great that's

7018.07 --> 7024.82
it guys I'm not crazy I'm not crazy

7019.69 --> 7026.199
everybody but these other people either

7024.82 --> 7030.19
the people that brought me into this

7026.199 --> 7032.5599999999995
stuff you know I created I created a lot

7030.19 --> 7034.719
of people you're in that credit

7032.56 --> 7036.79
accreditation of bringing me into flat

7034.719 --> 7039.219
earth bringing me into it

7036.79 --> 7043.06
I call it strange conversations for you

7039.219 --> 7047.76
because you have a lot of deep minded

7043.06 --> 7051.159000000001
thought processing talks mm-hmm you know

7047.76 --> 7060.1
for me I like to I like it's like you

7051.159 --> 7063.12
you're like hey mind I don't need a song

7060.1 --> 7066.610000000001
you know how I do it

7063.12 --> 7070.32
you know how I manage to do all this and

7066.61 --> 7073.69
still walk the path by literally

7070.32 --> 7076.78
disconnecting my ego self-worth from my

7073.69 --> 7079.69
intelligence I and I had a lot of

7076.78 --> 7082.03
trouble doing that because even in my

7079.69 --> 7085.509999999999
family it was kind of promoted that your

7082.03 --> 7087.639
self-worth does have a lot to do with

7085.51 --> 7090.37
how smart you are and that you have to

7087.639 --> 7091.42
prove it constantly and everything so it

7090.37 --> 7094.57
was very

7091.42 --> 7099.04
it was in there a lot but at some point

7094.57 --> 7102.13
I figured out wait my own declarations

7099.04 --> 7105.4
of self-worth that come from my ego are

7102.13 --> 7109.75
actually obstructing the free flow of my

7105.4 --> 7112.119
intelligence so I just said no I'll call

7109.75 --> 7115.42
myself intelligent but it'll feel now to

7112.119 --> 7118.449
me more like a curse saying that then oh

7115.42 --> 7121.869
my god I am so good right because I'm so

7118.449 --> 7125.169999999999
smart no it feels like a ego trip I

7121.869 --> 7127.8099999999995
would call you using your when you say

7125.17 --> 7131.9490000000005
oh I'm so intelligent I'm so smart I'm

7127.81 --> 7134.1990000000005
so jazzy that's for me that's ego right

7131.949 --> 7136.0599999999995
I never I never see how smart I am I say

7134.199 --> 7139.33
I know but it once my mine is very bad

7136.06 --> 7141.55
but it once a smart person you know

7139.33 --> 7145.51
right but I know there's somebody else

7141.55 --> 7148.9890000000005
in there that's pushing the smartness oh

7145.51 --> 7153.04
no but no no but I don't see it like

7148.989 --> 7156.04
that it's just it's there and it's not

7153.04 --> 7158.44
really mine I just happen to be lucky

7156.04 --> 7161.23
enough to have this capability and take

7158.44 --> 7163.48
really good care of it but it feels more

7161.23 --> 7167.349999999999
like it is a plant I'm taking care of

7163.48 --> 7171.218999999999
then a part that is really just me I'm

7167.35 --> 7173.110000000001
just sitting in between there yes it's

7171.219 --> 7176.5
not mine it doesn't feel like it's mine

7173.11 --> 7179.589999999999
in a sense and that that I can or should

7176.5 --> 7182.53
tied in with my self-worth it's more

7179.59 --> 7186.9400000000005
like a big responsibility and and a

7182.53 --> 7190.96
constant nuisance I agree with that

7186.94 --> 7193.54
constantly Kyle seduced us well it's

7190.96 --> 7196.3
more of a it is like you set a plant

7193.54 --> 7198.699
ignorance is bliss if you're really

7196.3 --> 7200.889
smart you're constantly getting bothered

7198.699 --> 7205.03
by how stupid people really are without

7200.889 --> 7208.54
even realizes that they don't even see

7205.03 --> 7211.119
that you can't even make them understand

7208.54 --> 7213.01
if you try to explain it why they're

7211.119 --> 7214.839999999999
being stupid about something you can

7213.01 --> 7218.110000000001
write it down for them and they'll still

7214.84 --> 7221.889
be like no no come on bro

7218.11 --> 7224.33
yeah and that is a big downside from

7221.889 --> 7228.38
just experiencing

7224.33 --> 7230.3
intelligence it's not how good it is

7228.38 --> 7232.37
very good though if you want to be a

7230.3 --> 7233.06
demon and just power-hungry and take

7232.37 --> 7238.36
control

7233.06 --> 7241.52
then intelligence is just great but yeah

7238.36 --> 7243.38
I wish I was like pinky in the brain and

7241.52 --> 7245.75
want to take over the world but my mind

7243.38 --> 7247.91
is like now bad fate come on you got to

7245.75 --> 7249.95
go this way you got you gotta listen to

7247.91 --> 7251.51
what I'm saying right now and if you

7249.95 --> 7252.32
don't listen to what I'm saying then try

7251.51 --> 7256.85
it your way

7252.32 --> 7258.44
and he didn't come back yep you know if

7256.85 --> 7262.58
you know if you don't think that I'm

7258.44 --> 7265.49
right about what I'm saying then I'm

7262.58 --> 7267.16
wrong that's my mind telling I admit I'm

7265.49 --> 7270.59
wrong and then you can move on and

7267.16 --> 7274.55
without me but I can never prove I can

7270.59 --> 7276.77
never prove my mind wrong as much like

7274.55 --> 7278.96
I'm a smart person so I'll be trying my

7276.77 --> 7281.75
best but how are you gonna do wrong one

7278.96 --> 7285.83
time your mind is the very core of

7281.75 --> 7288.35
cognitive cognitive function so how can

7285.83 --> 7291.8
you disprove your mind wrong except with

7288.35 --> 7294.700000000001
your mind it's well it's how you define

7291.8 --> 7297.41
things to be right in the first place

7294.7 --> 7300.98
except for feelings but still the mind

7297.41 --> 7303.62
then recognize it says yep that's that

7300.98 --> 7305.839999999999
frequency yeah feelings the killings are

7303.62 --> 7308.9
totally different than my mind can my

7305.84 --> 7312.17
mind gets confused when feelings come

7308.9 --> 7315.62
into play like love

7312.17 --> 7319.97
I teach love I teach love and finances

7315.62 --> 7321.94
I'm I'm like a financial love coach that

7319.97 --> 7325.58
I can I can tell you everything about

7321.94 --> 7328.669999999999
how you should do it but I'm not doing

7325.58 --> 7331.04
it that way you know I don't do it like

7328.67 --> 7332.6900000000005
my mind does it but I can tell you

7331.04 --> 7334.79
exactly what you need to do to get your

7332.69 --> 7336.44
finances on track I can tell you exactly

7334.79 --> 7339.32
what you need to do to make your

7336.44 --> 7342.169999999999
relationship 100% better I can tell you

7339.32 --> 7344.21
everything that you need to do but I

7342.17 --> 7346.1900000000005
sometimes I don't do that I don't listen

7344.21 --> 7348.74
to it when it comes to me I'm like oh

7346.19 --> 7351.5
man these are my feelings yeah that's

7348.74 --> 7353.75
another person that sounds unbelievably

7351.5 --> 7356.03
familiar because that's exactly what

7353.75 --> 7357.83
I've been doing almost my entire life

7356.03 --> 7361.58
having like you

7357.83 --> 7364.28
grand advice that really works yet not

7361.58 --> 7367.82
being able to overcome basic obstacles

7364.28 --> 7369.98
for myself right I can't do it I can

7367.82 --> 7372.74
never do what mine what I tell people to

7369.98 --> 7374.57
do I can tell you everything you know

7372.74 --> 7376.849999999999
how to budget your money down to the

7374.57 --> 7380.54
penny I tell people I can save one

7376.85 --> 7383.120000000001
dollar for a year it's been how do you

7380.54 --> 7388.19
grow the dollar well then you got a

7383.12 --> 7390.41
dollar to it what yeah grow it what will

7388.19 --> 7392.0
you do then well you got a pocket full

7390.41 --> 7394.12
of change in your pocket every day that

7392.0 --> 7397.16
you go to the gas station to the store

7394.12 --> 7406.849999999999
if you put that change in a jar for the

7397.16 --> 7408.47
rest of your life in there what no all

7406.85 --> 7411.8
the time so she takes all the change out

7408.47 --> 7414.62
of my pockets into this big water jug

7411.8 --> 7417.53
and I'm telling you she got three of

7414.62 --> 7419.54
these water jugs because she knows me

7417.53 --> 7420.32
she knows I'm gonna keep a lot of change

7419.54 --> 7422.09
in my pocket

7420.32 --> 7424.969999999999
I just told her I get a lot of ancient

7422.09 --> 7427.34
coins or I get a lot of money from

7424.97 --> 7428.6
different countries so if you can put

7427.34 --> 7431.110000000001
that in a different country bag or

7428.6 --> 7434.0
something you know I appreciate that

7431.11 --> 7436.25
yeah cuz I want to know where what where

7434.0 --> 7438.5
people are being at and you know I like

7436.25 --> 7440.93
to know things like to know about where

7438.5 --> 7443.27
people originated originated from you

7440.93 --> 7445.610000000001
know back in the days when I first first

7443.27 --> 7448.88
started off on I caught conspiracy

7445.61 --> 7450.74
theories I wanted to figure out I'm just

7448.88 --> 7451.7
gonna say it guys I'm not crazy I wanted

7450.74 --> 7453.62
to figure out what black people came

7451.7 --> 7455.929999999999
from I want to figure out the origin of

7453.62 --> 7458.84
Africa so I got I got involved with my

7455.93 --> 7463.46
money and the Torah dr. Bini oshimen and

7458.84 --> 7466.34
ash walkway see and these guys took me

7463.46 --> 7471.2300000000005
on journeys I wanted I went to Egypt to

7466.34 --> 7473.360000000001
see the the now and the pyramids and all

7471.23 --> 7475.429999999999
the writings on the walls from where we

7473.36 --> 7478.28
don't even know what just came from or

7475.43 --> 7479.93
who even designed this stuff so in my

7478.28 --> 7482.45
mind starting oh my god there's

7479.93 --> 7485.33
something else there is a creator

7482.45 --> 7487.2699999999995
somewhere we're missing it guys there's

7485.33 --> 7489.65
no Big Bang we're missing the Creator

7487.27 --> 7491.3
why values people just disappear were

7489.65 --> 7491.759999999999
these people went were the Mayans and

7491.3 --> 7493.71
Incas

7491.76 --> 7497.64
and all you other people rat now we

7493.71 --> 7501.96
don't even know well we do know you'll

7497.64 --> 7504.660000000001
never clean out by what by the

7501.96 --> 7508.2
controllers rearranging the landscape

7504.66 --> 7511.26
rewriting the history and moving around

7508.2 --> 7514.22
yeah furniture basically yeah I agree

7511.26 --> 7516.99
with that because they want to erase

7514.22 --> 7521.7300000000005
what these people made they wanted to

7516.99 --> 7525.51
erase different parts of our creation

7521.73 --> 7527.61
right well they want to if it really

7525.51 --> 7529.29
comes down to they want to erase the

7527.61 --> 7533.339999999999
memory of us ever having been

7529.29 --> 7535.38
independent from them they want their

7533.34 --> 7538.5
very existence and the way they do

7535.38 --> 7542.52
things to be ingrained at the very core

7538.5 --> 7544.86
of everything that we understand they

7542.52 --> 7549.39
want to be there in our minds at the

7544.86 --> 7552.36
beginning forever yes so yeah taking

7549.39 --> 7554.7300000000005
over God you taking over God that's what

7552.36 --> 7556.86
they did they took over the deity I made

7554.73 --> 7559.4
that made them the deities so we can

7556.86 --> 7563.07
believe in them so we can lose our sites

7559.4 --> 7565.23
you know and we did we lost it we lost

7563.07 --> 7568.049999999999
our site we lost our we lost our way of

7565.23 --> 7569.839999999999
thinking you know like there's a certain

7568.05 --> 7573.09
amount of people or a certain amount of

7569.84 --> 7575.34
beings that can do more than what we can

7573.09 --> 7577.83
now like there's there's kids out there

7575.34 --> 7581.37
that can move stuff with their mind we

7577.83 --> 7585.09
can use more of our mind to still have

7581.37 --> 7586.92
to see demonstration of that but it's

7585.09 --> 7590.610000000001
really all I've seen demonstrations of

7586.92 --> 7593.4
it and for me I thought it was like some

7590.61 --> 7596.28
kind of magic trick or some kind of some

7593.4 --> 7600.83
kind of I don't know trick that they

7596.28 --> 7603.3
were tricking my mind to see you know

7600.83 --> 7606.6
but I've seen lots of demonstrations of

7603.3 --> 7610.74
intelligent kids intelligent adults you

7606.6 --> 7612.51
know I've seen I know a lot of people

7610.74 --> 7619.2
back in the day back in the 90s who were

7612.51 --> 7621.0
part of part of the I was in Kate alt

7619.2 --> 7623.28
respect

7621.0 --> 7625.05
those people who can see the future or

7623.28 --> 7627.54
who can go into their mind and grin

7625.05 --> 7629.67
travel yeah into the like mean future

7627.54 --> 7632.64
and see what's going on and then bring

7629.67 --> 7635.52
it back and tell us what's going on you

7632.64 --> 7638.34
know I was into that mm-hmm you know and

7635.52 --> 7640.110000000001
my mind was like I said I had to figure

7638.34 --> 7642.51
out from that point on I had to figure

7640.11 --> 7644.73
out everything you know I had to figure

7642.51 --> 7648.42
out what was going on so I stopped I

7644.73 --> 7651.33
lost a lot of my teaching of what what's

7648.42 --> 7654.42
real what I was taught in the in the 70s

7651.33 --> 7656.07
and 80s I lost that stuff I lost that

7654.42 --> 7658.68
stuff and I started thinking okay that

7656.07 --> 7660.69
sounded what this was this is what I

7658.68 --> 7663.27
wasn't meant to see this is what I

7660.69 --> 7666.24
wasn't meant to do okay I understand

7663.27 --> 7669.3
that now I got that you know I got this

7666.24 --> 7670.92
I got that you know I like I see people

7669.3 --> 7671.99
we were the first human beings on earth

7670.92 --> 7675.75
okay

7671.99 --> 7678.33
were we going from this I was going from

7675.75 --> 7680.67
Adam and Eve theory where everybody came

7678.33 --> 7683.1
from a part of Africa that we don't know

7680.67 --> 7685.26
about you know are we going with that

7683.1 --> 7687.21
theory are we going with the Big Bang

7685.26 --> 7690.39
Theory where we was just put here from

7687.21 --> 7692.82
nothing you know and then we traveled

7690.39 --> 7695.55
the earth after we were put here from a

7692.82 --> 7698.759999999999
frog and then to a it sounds crazy from

7695.55 --> 7701.9400000000005
a froggen to a monkey to a person come

7698.76 --> 7702.96
on you know ain't no monkeys are

7701.94 --> 7705.719999999999
evolving today

7702.96 --> 7707.16
ain't nothing of Bobby today into I mean

7705.72 --> 7708.72
the a got count closer Bobby's into

7707.16 --> 7711.48
butterflies of course but that's their

7708.72 --> 7713.490000000001
natural design you know this is the

7711.48 --> 7715.29
natural design of these creatures that

7713.49 --> 7716.57
are evolving into another creature no

7715.29 --> 7719.43
they're not really

7716.57 --> 7722.16
wait oh you're talking about transition

7719.43 --> 7724.02
states like pupil stage and all that yes

7722.16 --> 7726.0599999999995
yeah but that we evolved from baby

7724.02 --> 7729.240000000001
treatment it's a baby too man all right

7726.06 --> 7732.81
so from fetus to too little sperm cell

7729.24 --> 7735.78
to a person I understand that indeed

7732.81 --> 7738.660000000001
well that it's natural for a creature

7735.78 --> 7742.5
that is uniform that actually grows from

7738.66 --> 7745.65
very tiny to very big it has to undergo

7742.5 --> 7748.35
constant transmutation because its

7745.65 --> 7750.299999999999
entire form is adapting constantly to a

7748.35 --> 7752.55
new size even though it's not that

7750.3 --> 7753.719
apparent and takes more time it is

7752.55 --> 7756.179
pretty much just

7753.719 --> 7760.469
as much of a practical transition as

7756.179 --> 7761.729
from a caterpillar to a butterfly only

7760.469 --> 7768.21
that is just much more in-your-face

7761.729 --> 7770.849
visible right all right if you realize

7768.21 --> 7771.719
that from a little baby up to a big guy

7770.849 --> 7774.42
or a girl

7771.719 --> 7778.979
yeah that's total transformation it's

7774.42 --> 7781.8
like nothing what it was all right and

7778.979 --> 7783.96
then we start being bombarded with what

7781.8 --> 7786.659000000001
they want us to know what they want us

7783.96 --> 7787.7390000000005
to learn what they want is to you know

7786.659 --> 7790.199
that's what that's what a problem

7787.739 --> 7792.089999999999
getting for me because my mind has to

7790.199 --> 7794.969
erase all that I might have to say

7792.09 --> 7796.4400000000005
that's all this right here I know it's

7794.969 --> 7799.71
probably thought you're teaching all

7796.44 --> 7802.079
this you're gone yeah for me to like I

7799.71 --> 7804.479
still remember it it just lost all this

7802.079 --> 7806.909
weight there's no more value there the

7804.479 --> 7809.070000000001
net has broken there's nothing left to

7806.909 --> 7811.949
catch in that idea you know what I owe

7809.07 --> 7815.88
you I turned off the Skynet and said let

7811.949 --> 7817.619
me think oh I own let me think on my own

7815.88 --> 7820.619
here I gotta figure this out on my own

7817.619 --> 7821.249
because listening to even listening to

7820.619 --> 7822.929
you guys

7821.249 --> 7826.679
even listen to all the all this stuff

7822.929 --> 7829.559
I've learned from from Eric Dubay on and

7826.679 --> 7832.079
to and to now I take that stuff and I

7829.559 --> 7834.119000000001
have to listen to it and then I have to

7832.079 --> 7837.03
see what you guys are going with it like

7834.119 --> 7838.768999999999
when I'm listening to - John and and -

7837.03 --> 7840.78
Nathan talked about the ball at the ball

7838.769 --> 7842.729
buster stuff I have to go and figure out

7840.78 --> 7844.499
what they talking about first I have to

7842.729 --> 7848.579000000001
go and figure I go to every one of those

7844.499 --> 7851.67
sites that John puts up to see what he's

7848.579 --> 7855.42
talking about so before I can believe

7851.67 --> 7858.53
what he's telling you is true you know I

7855.42 --> 7861.92
have to go and look at it and say oh

7858.53 --> 7865.249
yeah Newton didn't say it was like okay

7861.92 --> 7865.249
that's not a

7868.929 --> 7874.81
you know so that's the gracious part of

7872.08 --> 7876.64
it all is that it's just known that

7874.81 --> 7881.05
Newton Newton never claimed an

7876.64 --> 7883.51
hypothesis distinctly and still the

7881.05 --> 7887.89
entire education system literally calls

7883.51 --> 7889.27
the law of gravitation and yes and

7887.89 --> 7892.9890000000005
that's what that's what the problem is

7889.27 --> 7895.150000000001
where people all understand is if for me

7892.989 --> 7896.65
my mind says if we wasn't back there

7895.15 --> 7898.15
when Newton was writing this stuff and

7896.65 --> 7900.48
figuring it out and giving those long

7898.15 --> 7902.5599999999995
speeches to everybody in the country

7900.48 --> 7904.0
then how can you believe what Newton

7902.56 --> 7906.909000000001
what Newton was talking about these were

7904.0 --> 7909.429
written things that after he was dead

7906.909 --> 7914.049999999999
was published after we don't know if

7909.429 --> 7915.9400000000005
they the powers that be came in okay

7914.05 --> 7918.4890000000005
Newton said this let's put it in all

7915.94 --> 7929.0199999999995
right this is the force and this is this

7918.489 --> 7933.669999999999
and gravity yeah you know and then let's

7929.02 --> 7937.179
everybody else all right well I'm pretty

7933.67 --> 7939.37
sure that he had a a gang with with like

7937.179 --> 7943.06
like a freemason gang or a group of

7939.37 --> 7945.57
friends and fellows study years that

7943.06 --> 7948.6
that he worked this stuff out with and

7945.57 --> 7951.37
then those friends after he died

7948.6 --> 7953.77
basically said yeah he got exactly what

7951.37 --> 7958.21
we need okay he's dead anyway let's just

7953.77 --> 7960.540000000001
use him as a as a foundation for the to

7958.21 --> 7964.84
birth this concept into the wider world

7960.54 --> 7968.469
yeah how we want to go let's put it how

7964.84 --> 7971.04
we want it you know right because when

7968.469 --> 7974.62
he was alive he was like no way I'm not

7971.04 --> 7977.949
that's that that God does not agree with

7974.62 --> 7981.909
me doing that because he was religious

7977.949 --> 7984.909
he was very Christian he had the path he

7981.909 --> 7986.679
had the sense for that that what is

7984.909 --> 7990.699
really wrong and what isn't

7986.679 --> 7994.4800000000005
he didn't want it he want - he wanted to

7990.699 --> 7997.96
keep it in the speculation realm yes and

7994.48 --> 7999.909
that's why he wrote that yeah that's

7997.96 --> 8001.719
exactly why I did it like I said there's

7999.909 --> 8006.089999999999
many people out there when Nicholas

8001.719 --> 8006.09
and Einstein came out they were battling

8006.719 --> 8013.69
that they were coming up with but by the

8010.389 --> 8017.499
eye science that they were doing back

8013.69 --> 8020.348999999999
then you know and then someone else came

8017.499 --> 8023.469
in and said okay he they're dead let's

8020.349 --> 8025.9490000000005
rewrite this our way and put him and

8023.469 --> 8029.349
putting this stuff oh yeah we want I

8025.949 --> 8031.96
know I'm Newton Nikola Tesla want

8029.349 --> 8032.679
everybody to pay for electric that's why

8031.96 --> 8036.13
he built it

8032.679 --> 8037.84
what okay that's awesome you know but

8036.13 --> 8040.809
Nikola Tesla's writings I went back into

8037.84 --> 8043.719
the his old writings and he was just

8040.809 --> 8047.229
inventing this stuff he was

8043.719 --> 8050.38
experimenting with this stuff right no

8047.229 --> 8052.869000000001
and then the the Future Electric Company

8050.38 --> 8056.619
basically picked what they wanted from

8052.869 --> 8058.44
him yes and he didn't even really care

8056.619 --> 8061.96
that much because he had already

8058.44 --> 8064.869
discarded society you already thought

8061.96 --> 8071.05
yeah everyone is almost irredeemable I'm

8064.869 --> 8072.909
just gonna do what I do and so I just

8071.05 --> 8075.28
didn't care he just knew like yeah I'm

8072.909 --> 8077.409
not even gonna try to fight that against

8075.28 --> 8081.099
this because it'll just detract from the

8077.409 --> 8082.42
quality of my output they're gonna take

8081.099 --> 8082.929
it over anyways I'm not gonna worry

8082.42 --> 8085.809
about it

8082.929 --> 8088.929
you know I think he already knew I did

8085.809 --> 8094.059
he was absolute genius so with with far

8088.929 --> 8102.28
insight you can see things coming oh yes

8094.059 --> 8105.13
oh yes right hey I wanna know no it's

8102.28 --> 8106.989
awesome I love this show but I do run

have hit for him to have a real opinion

he's just trying to be a host now that's

8331.86 --> 8338.390000000001
his thing okay so I guess I can watch
