270.96 --> 274.79999999999995
uncomfortable having that shirt on

276.16 --> 279.28000000000003
as

277.68 --> 282.52
i just need

279.28 --> 282.52

316.32 --> 319.12
i mean

316.83 --> 321.75899999999996
[Music]

376.72 --> 379.90900000000005
[Music]

383.62 --> 386.68
[Music]

386.72 --> 391.199

you is without sin throw your first

391.199 --> 395.28000000000003
cousin

392.8 --> 398.08
that is obviously a

395.28 --> 401.919
a hybrid reference

398.08 --> 401.919
right to both the bible and

403.28 --> 408.31899999999996
uh

405.52 --> 411.68
it's called michelle fowler so the the

408.319 --> 413.28000000000003
nasa figure that said that

411.68 --> 415.52
look at that rock that could be your

413.28 --> 416.33
cousin

415.52 --> 418.88
i combine it

416.33 --> 423.28
[Music]

418.88 --> 425.759
just silly little jokes that i do

423.28 --> 425.75899999999996
come on

426.0 --> 429.0
great

442.72 --> 446.03900000000004
there you go

453.61 --> 456.829
[Music]

459.54 --> 466.8
[Music]

463.36 --> 470.44
i still got an emergency fan here

466.8 --> 470.44
that's really necessary

474.43 --> 479.15000000000003
[Music]

480.16 --> 483.77000000000004
your first cousin is way too heavy for

482.319 --> 485.84000000000003
you to throw

483.77 --> 487.19899999999996
[Music]

485.84 --> 489.11999999999995
right

487.199 --> 492.84000000000003
it's also by the way a reference to

489.12 --> 492.84000000000003
gimli of course

493.039 --> 500.08
right i mean dwarves don't like tossing

496.96 --> 503.0
but they have a lot of cousins

500.08 --> 506.329
ta-da

503.0 --> 506.329
[Music]

506.639 --> 513.08
uh yeah jarvis never ever say that again

510.08 --> 513.0799999999999
ever

524.48 --> 529.8000000000001
why because that's a grave insult to me

536.0 --> 542.64
yeah for me my hair is

538.56 --> 542.64
also kind of a religious statement

542.959 --> 545.8389999999999
so yeah

546.0 --> 548.64
you're about yourself well that's your

547.68 --> 551.279
problem

548.64 --> 551.279
not mine

554.77 --> 557.9499999999999
[Music]

560.56 --> 563.8389999999999
i think bald is gay

564.64 --> 569.279
just be

565.76 --> 569.279
honest with you straight on

573.76 --> 577.279
didn't almost religious thing for me

575.519 --> 578.88
well look i

577.279 --> 582.08
paid a lot

578.88 --> 583.2
for my long hair okay started growing it

582.08 --> 584.5600000000001
at 12

583.2 --> 585.76
at a school

584.56 --> 588.0799999999999
where they

585.76 --> 590.72
literally told me it wasn't even allowed

588.08 --> 592.1600000000001
to do that and i did it anyway

590.72 --> 594.64
okay

592.16 --> 596.88
i got a whole bunch of bullying for my

594.64 --> 599.8389999999999
long hair people literally calling me

596.88 --> 603.04
gay because i had long hair

599.839 --> 605.839
okay throughout my teens

603.04 --> 605.8389999999999
like

607.92 --> 612.3199999999999
and then later on i got kind of

609.92 --> 614.3199999999999
convinced like oh maybe i am gay i don't

612.32 --> 616.399
know what that even means actually it

614.32 --> 618.399
seems to be a negative thing

616.399 --> 619.839
literally that ignorant like i did not

618.399 --> 622.8
even understand that there's such a

619.839 --> 626.0
thing as like homosexuality

622.8 --> 630.7199999999999
like i heard about it i just did not

626.0 --> 630.72
understand anything about that at all

631.44 --> 634.32
but uh yeah

635.2 --> 638.32
how is bald gay

638.72 --> 643.88
i

639.44 --> 643.8800000000001
i i just think it is

647.36 --> 651.2
i mean

648.56 --> 653.76
let's just say it's a lot harder for a

651.2 --> 657.2
bald man not to be gay compared to

653.76 --> 657.2
somebody that isn't bald

657.36 --> 661.6
it just makes you look

658.839 --> 662.8000000000001
gay i know

661.6 --> 666.48
like

662.8 --> 666.4799999999999
most gay guys

666.8 --> 672.7199999999999
that i've like identified as gay guys

669.04 --> 674.8
were all bald okay most of them not all

672.72 --> 678.0790000000001
but ugh

674.8 --> 678.959
bald is not a choice no balding is not a

678.079 --> 681.04
choice

678.959 --> 684.959
right if you lose your hair that doesn't

681.04 --> 684.959
mean you have to shave it all off

685.2 --> 689.839
that's weak

687.04 --> 689.8389999999999
in my opinion

695.92 --> 698.399
right

697.12 --> 700.8
yeah but

698.399 --> 703.839
that's just my opinion i am very fond of

700.8 --> 703.8389999999999
hair in general

704.079 --> 706.8
on heads

705.36 --> 709.04
specifically

706.8 --> 709.04
and

710.56 --> 716.2399999999999
the samson story from the bible always

713.04 --> 718.959
inspired me

716.24 --> 721.279
it inspired me to grow long hair as i

718.959 --> 723.1999999999999
did also everybody in my full

721.279 --> 724.56
all the men in my family had long hair

723.2 --> 725.519
my mother didn't

724.56 --> 726.8
what

725.519 --> 730.399
okay

726.8 --> 730.399
weirdo weirdo liberals

736.88 --> 741.519
yeah neil degrasse tysonized look i'm

738.639 --> 745.839
not telling you oh how dare you

741.519 --> 745.839
i'm just saying i don't like it

746.639 --> 750.88
and i mean there are guys that are bold

749.12 --> 752.72
that are kind of cool and all that like

750.88 --> 755.519
it doesn't really matter all that much

752.72 --> 755.519
it's just that

757.6 --> 762.24
people uh

759.279 --> 765.12
bald gaze just really gross me out and

762.24 --> 766.88
that's why i just associated with it i

765.12 --> 768.32
don't know what it is they call it

766.88 --> 770.72
mercurian

768.32 --> 772.639
sometimes

770.72 --> 774.88
doesn't have to make any sense to you

772.639 --> 778.9590000000001
guys i just don't like it i'm never

774.88 --> 781.279
gonna cut my hair i've never cut my hair

778.959 --> 782.56
since i was 12

781.279 --> 785.2

782.56 --> 787.68
i will never do that

785.2 --> 790.639
even if it degenerates further i will

787.68 --> 793.279
figure out how to deal with it

790.639 --> 795.36
right maybe i'll be do like a weird

793.279 --> 797.4399999999999
partially

795.36 --> 800.8000000000001
like i could imagine that this front

797.44 --> 803.0400000000001

800.8 --> 804.959
i really hope it won't it will it hey if

803.04 --> 807.519

804.959 --> 809.5189999999999

no

815.68 --> 821.3599999999999

[Music]

south asian female models are eurasia

978.079 --> 983.04
yeah i know

979.36 --> 985.04
because asians know that europeans are

983.04 --> 987.36
freaking beautiful

985.04 --> 989.519
but they need creation for that asian

987.36 --> 990.8000000000001
local pride

989.519 --> 992.8
so yeah

990.8 --> 996.079
of course

992.8 --> 999.279
all the eurasian models

996.079 --> 1002.3199999999999
are all popular in china

999.279 --> 1002.32
they know what's beautiful

hanging around with satanists and all

that and they stripped him of every part

it's definitely not me well

1256.08 --> 1262.559
i've seen weirder things

1259.28 --> 1265.12
right but yeah he's done it before

1262.559 --> 1267.36
like where he was hanging around in my

chat as another person for like two

1267.36 --> 1271.9189999999999
months straight

1269.28 --> 1274.8799999999999
having conversations and then at some

1271.919 --> 1276.88
point he just burst open until oh it was

1274.88 --> 1278.96
me all along

1276.88 --> 1282.0800000000002
because he can't help but he's a [ __ ]

1278.96 --> 1286.159
gay and he wants to be slain

1282.08 --> 1286.1589999999999
he wants to die by my hand

1288.48 --> 1292.4
right because he can't do it himself

1290.72 --> 1296.48
because he's a [ __ ] coward you see

1292.4 --> 1299.2800000000002
two [ __ ] cowardice to kill himself

1296.48 --> 1304.3600000000001

option for a piece of [ __ ] like you

1304.73 --> 1307.789
[Music]

1308.32 --> 1312.52
small peepee dude i don't even think he

1312.52 --> 1315.71
[Music]

1315.919 --> 1321.8400000000001
hammered nails in it or something he's

that kind of piece of [ __ ]

1324.5 --> 1329.65
[Music]

1331.36 --> 1336.799
but yeah i don't want to waste my stream

1333.44 --> 1336.799
on that scumbag

1337.52 --> 1341.4
so let's move on

1356.64 --> 1361.64
i wouldn't even call it that

1358.48 --> 1361.64
you know

1361.679 --> 1365.44
it's more like limp dick

1364.32 --> 1369.84
right

1365.44 --> 1371.28
like sex addict satanic gay types

1369.84 --> 1373.28
like it doesn't really matter if they

1371.28 --> 1376.799
have a small penis

1373.28 --> 1379.9189999999999
or a big venus like american big penis

1376.799 --> 1383.12
oh we i shall we saw small penis

1379.919 --> 1384.5590000000002
yeah luckily i'm only one sixteenth

1383.12 --> 1389.28
asian

1384.559 --> 1391.44
so uh don't worry about that part

1389.28 --> 1393.52
but the problem is not their size the

1391.44 --> 1395.76
problem is is that they just can't get

1393.52 --> 1399.36
it up nothing excites them anymore

1395.76 --> 1401.12
because they've just they're sex addicts

1399.36 --> 1403.84
and

1401.12 --> 1406.08
they suck everything about them sucks

1403.84 --> 1410.559
and then just nothing does it for them

1406.08 --> 1411.6
anymore while they are addicted to that

1410.559 --> 1415.12
it's just

1411.6 --> 1418.34
disgusting disgusting in every

1415.12 --> 1421.5

1431.76 --> 1435.279

1437.36 --> 1441.039
i mean he doesn't even get involved in

any

1441.039 --> 1448.96
flat earth related subjects really he is

1444.32 --> 1448.96

1462.72 --> 1466.0
bobby's one inch away from being a woman

1464.72 --> 1468.159
no

1466.0 --> 1472.0
no

1468.159 --> 1475.0390000000002
that's a very weird thing to say

1472.0 --> 1477.679
mean there is no spectrum

1475.039 --> 1481.2
of distance between men and women you're

1477.679 --> 1481.2
either a man or a woman

1481.6 --> 1486.1589999999999
and

1482.559 --> 1488.799
if you start to behave like a woman as a

1486.159 --> 1490.7990000000002
man then you're a [ __ ]

1488.799 --> 1493.12
you're never gonna actually become a

1490.799 --> 1493.12
woman

1495.12 --> 1499.1999999999998
i mean you might trick everybody in

1496.88 --> 1500.5590000000002
thinking that you are one or look like

1499.2 --> 1502.96
one but

1500.559 --> 1505.2
that doesn't actually make you one

1502.96 --> 1507.76

financially i have been kind of

1524.24 --> 1527.679
struggling recently

1526.48 --> 1529.76
and that's

1527.679 --> 1531.039
why i am

1529.76 --> 1536.24
insisting

1531.039 --> 1536.24
on a more regular basis to gain support

1536.559 --> 1541.12
because i really do need it

1538.72 --> 1543.919
just to get around

1541.12 --> 1547.6
and so far it's kind of old just in the

1543.919 --> 1547.6000000000001
nick of time worked out and everything

1555.279 --> 1559.12

support

guys and girls

1562.32 --> 1566.1589999999999

1870.399 --> 1875.4399999999998
that just felt like i have to or i'm

1872.559 --> 1877.519
like gonna lose my family or i'm gonna

1875.44 --> 1880.64
lose my house

1877.519 --> 1882.24
right i do worry for people

1880.64 --> 1884.24
so

1882.24 --> 1886.96
i haven't really talked to you in that

1884.24 --> 1888.88
phase as much

1886.96 --> 1892.44
i'm glad to hear that you have been able

1888.88 --> 1892.44
to avoid it

1909.919 --> 1913.76
i own a opal

1912.24 --> 1915.2
okay

1913.76 --> 1915.78
vox hall

1915.2 --> 1918.159
what

1915.78 --> 1921.12
[Music]

1918.159 --> 1924.3990000000001
no that doesn't come

1921.12 --> 1927.039
besides you really want it

1924.399 --> 1928.8799999999999
are you trying to be oh i got one uh

1927.039 --> 1933.08
this is the wrong thing

1928.88 --> 1933.0800000000002
to do that with blatant

1935.6 --> 1940.7199999999998
winter in south africa must be nice

1938.399 --> 1940.7199999999998
is it

1942.159 --> 1946.8400000000001
not so cold that's what i thought it's

1944.08 --> 1950.799
not really cold winters in south

1946.84 --> 1953.1999999999998
africa besides south africa

1950.799 --> 1955.9189999999999
compared to like for example australia

1953.2 --> 1958.88
and south america there south south

1955.919 --> 1961.88
africa is really not that much south

1958.88 --> 1961.88
even

1966.399 --> 1971.1999999999998
right so

1968.72 --> 1974.08
i think that like the the

1971.2 --> 1974.88
the peak of argentina

1974.08 --> 1978.24
and

1974.88 --> 1980.64
maybe australia that they might be able

1978.24 --> 1983.519
to get a lot more cold during the winter

1980.64 --> 1987.48
because they're just further south

1983.519 --> 1987.48
compared to south africa

1991.44 --> 1995.519
and of course it's directly tied to an

1994.0 --> 1998.32
open ocean so it's going to have that

1995.519 --> 2000.32
ocean as oceanic climate which usually

1998.32 --> 2003.84
leads to less

2000.32 --> 2008.08
snow during winter times because oceanic

2003.84 --> 2008.08
climate averages out the temperature

2011.36 --> 2015.399
especially during the winters

2018.24 --> 2021.679
yeah indeed flat side

2024.0 --> 2027.2
what who deleted that

2030.24 --> 2033.84
what's going on here

2034.24 --> 2038.3990000000001
chile

2035.76 --> 2040.8799999999999
is near the ice wall

2038.399 --> 2042.399
not so much

2040.88 --> 2044.7990000000002
sleets

2042.399 --> 2044.799
is it

2045.519 --> 2049.44
huh

2047.2 --> 2052.839
what how did you know

2049.44 --> 2052.839
okay fine

2061.8 --> 2068.3990000000003
[Music]

2064.879 --> 2068.399
you know what would be great

2070.72 --> 2076.0
although it probably wouldn't even last

2073.359 --> 2079.0
no never mind

2076.0 --> 2079.0
hmm

2091.2 --> 2094.3199999999997
oh

2092.159 --> 2095.52
yeah good one yeah i hadn't even seen

2094.32 --> 2097.76
that

2095.52 --> 2097.7599999999998
huh

2099.839 --> 2104.839
yeah that's in that's very sharp via lsg

2142.8 --> 2147.8390000000004
it's weird man sometimes i watch at my

2145.2 --> 2149.7599999999998
own screen

2147.839 --> 2151.599
and then i'm like wait did my camera

2149.76 --> 2154.88
just freeze

2151.599 --> 2157.44
and then suddenly i start moving

2154.88 --> 2159.599
so funny it happens a lot i do set like

2157.44 --> 2162.8
really still sometimes i don't know how

2159.599 --> 2162.8
i do it but i do

2167.359 --> 2173.48
i only really notice that it's frozen

2169.52 --> 2173.48
when i start moving around

2175.44 --> 2180.599
so today it hasn't frozen up on me just

2177.599 --> 2180.599
yet

2188.96 --> 2192.32
ah

2189.839 --> 2194.0789999999997
right so flat side you're married into

2192.32 --> 2196.7200000000003
miners

2194.079 --> 2199.119
but you're not your family isn't

2196.72 --> 2201.839
from your branch

2199.119 --> 2201.839
hmm

2209.839 --> 2212.56
still wins

2213.68 --> 2218.52
i don't know about that

2215.52 --> 2218.52
anyway

2221.29 --> 2224.449
[Music]

2228.8 --> 2233.599
let's figure out

2230.32 --> 2233.599
what am i going to talk about

2235.28 --> 2239.28
flat earth debate yesterday was not

2237.839 --> 2241.44
super long

2239.28 --> 2243.6800000000003
i kind of slept through part of it i was

2241.44 --> 2248.0
so exhausted from the heat and all that

2243.68 --> 2248.0
i just kind of slept through a lot of it

2249.28 --> 2254.0
not that it wasn't interesting it's just

2251.04 --> 2254.0
that i was just like

2255.28 --> 2257.92
two hearts

2263.52 --> 2268.7599999999998
caught up on more owen benjamin that was

2265.76 --> 2268.76
great

2275.52 --> 2281.44
flat side still doing live streams even

2278.0 --> 2283.28
though it is dude

2281.44 --> 2284.88
i really hope your computer your new

2283.28 --> 2287.8390000000004
computer is going to fix this [ __ ]

2284.88 --> 2290.0
because it's just i have to admit i find

2287.839 --> 2292.4
your streams really annoying

2290.0 --> 2294.32
because the sound quality is so shitty

2292.4 --> 2295.92
and just turning the volume loud doesn't

2294.32 --> 2296.839
even help it

2295.92 --> 2299.52
this

2296.839 --> 2301.119
is so i really hope that you're going to

2299.52 --> 2303.68
be able to fix that

2301.119 --> 2303.6800000000003
properly

2309.839 --> 2313.599
well

2310.839 --> 2316.56
mike thoughts yeah i already gave my

2313.599 --> 2316.56
thoughts on that [ __ ]

2322.24 --> 2325.72
it's all ridiculous

2327.99 --> 2331.18
[Music]

2342.079 --> 2346.3590000000004
yeah by the way hello price of atom

2358.0 --> 2364.64
all right but yeah oh uh

2361.119 --> 2364.6400000000003
i watched moonfall

2365.76 --> 2372.7200000000003
what a weird ass movie

2369.28 --> 2376.0
interesting and stupid at the same time

2372.72 --> 2376.0
and that's really special

2379.44 --> 2385.04
i mean they basically just

2382.0 --> 2387.359
had like a conspiracy theory

2385.04 --> 2389.119
turning out to be real

2387.359 --> 2392.16
and that's that's pretty much what the

2389.119 --> 2394.96
movie is but yeah the cgi that they put

2392.16 --> 2396.16
on top of it and the backstory was like

2394.96 --> 2398.2400000000002
what

2396.16 --> 2402.7999999999997
bread

2398.24 --> 2407.9599999999996
that is like really good cgi though

2402.8 --> 2407.96
that on netflix no i downloaded it

2410.56 --> 2413.44
no it's

2411.839 --> 2416.48
like from a

2413.44 --> 2416.48
very recent movie

2419.92 --> 2425.44
but it's so stupid like the

2421.96 --> 2428.48
conversations are so lame

2425.44 --> 2430.8
they're like a kiddie [ __ ] like that's

2428.48 --> 2433.68
conversations like 12 like who wrote

2430.8 --> 2435.92
this freaking script a 12 year old

2433.68 --> 2438.24
i'm serious like these conversations are

2435.92 --> 2441.28
[ __ ] lame

2438.24 --> 2443.9199999999996
like lame lame

2441.28 --> 2443.92
it's like a

2444.359 --> 2450.24
downgraded

2446.079 --> 2450.2400000000002
disaster movie where it's just dumb

2451.52 --> 2457.119
but the cgi was freaking amazing i've

2454.24 --> 2458.64
never seen anything like that

2457.119 --> 2461.119
literally

2458.64 --> 2462.319
like the cgi was so impressive that i

2461.119 --> 2464.56
was like

2462.319 --> 2464.56
what

2464.8 --> 2467.44
where

2465.68 --> 2469.7599999999998
spoiler alert

2467.44 --> 2474.079
like the moon

2469.76 --> 2475.119
is basically scraping past the earth

2474.079 --> 2476.2400000000002
and like

2475.119 --> 2478.6400000000003
passing

2476.24 --> 2481.1189999999997
over it and then like stuff just starts

2478.64 --> 2484.0789999999997
falling up and dropping down while it

2481.119 --> 2486.2400000000002
passes and they all cgi'd it and it was

2484.079 --> 2488.96
like holy [ __ ] bro

2486.24 --> 2491.4399999999996
that is like

2488.96 --> 2492.56
well a nightmare but it is almost like a

2491.44 --> 2495.2000000000003
dream

2492.56 --> 2497.92
that you could have

2495.2 --> 2501.839
it's very dreamy

2497.92 --> 2504.319
right so the cgi it was super impressive

2501.839 --> 2505.92
it really was i was really impressed by

2504.319 --> 2508.72
all the cgi

2505.92 --> 2511.6800000000003
but the story is just like

2508.72 --> 2516.16
oh a really goofy

2511.68 --> 2518.96
conspiracy theory basically the idea

2516.16 --> 2521.359
from david ike right the david ike

2518.96 --> 2522.56
hollow moon space station

2521.359 --> 2525.119
well

2522.56 --> 2526.4
this is the movie of that

2525.119 --> 2528.96
literally

2526.4 --> 2530.64
literally david ike's model is this

2528.96 --> 2533.359
movie

2530.64 --> 2537.839
and maybe even expanded upon a little

2533.359 --> 2537.839
but just like what the [ __ ]

2540.72 --> 2545.9199999999996
oh yeah and at the end of it because it

2543.119 --> 2547.44
scraped past the earth all the dust on

2545.92 --> 2551.04
the moon

2547.44 --> 2555.76
had all fallen off on the earth and so

2551.04 --> 2555.7599999999998
it was just the original megastructure

2557.92 --> 2562.8
you didn't see the moonscape with all

2561.04 --> 2565.7599999999998
the dust and the craters it was just

2562.8 --> 2568.4
like a machine it was like the death

2565.76 --> 2570.7200000000003
star like it was like oh now the moon

2568.4 --> 2574.56
has revealed for what it really is a

2570.72 --> 2577.2
death star that was like the origin

2574.56 --> 2578.64
it's the origin of life on earth i don't

2577.2 --> 2579.839
know i don't want to spoil the rest of

2578.64 --> 2582.24
the story

2579.839 --> 2585.119
it is an interesting watch

2582.24 --> 2587.7599999999998
and i did like the characters

2585.119 --> 2589.119
i mean like one of these conspiracy guys

2587.76 --> 2591.2000000000003
that becomes a very much a main

2589.119 --> 2593.52
character you'll figure it out

2591.2 --> 2596.16
is like that my favorite guy from game

2593.52 --> 2598.4
of thrones the little chubby wizard

2596.16 --> 2600.72
that's such a freaking nice guy

2598.4 --> 2603.359
i don't know his name but he is in this

2600.72 --> 2605.839
movie and it's like awesome i just like

2603.359 --> 2607.04
that guy i really hope he's not some

2605.839 --> 2609.2799999999997
freaky

2607.04 --> 2611.2799999999997
disgusting satanist or something

2609.28 --> 2613.52
underneath it though i really hope he's

2611.28 --> 2616.579
actually a nice guy

2613.52 --> 2616.579
[Music]

2618.839 --> 2626.24
ugh but uh yeah i did like it it's just

2622.56 --> 2630.24
that the dialogue seemed really stupid

2626.24 --> 2630.24
and the story built up was just like

2631.28 --> 2638.6400000000003
but yeah the action was pretty badass

2635.28 --> 2641.3590000000004
and the cgi quality overall was really

2638.64 --> 2644.72
mesmerizing it was like one of the best

2641.359 --> 2647.04
space cg i've ever seen

2644.72 --> 2647.04
really

2647.599 --> 2651.92
so

2648.4 --> 2651.92
they got that part down right

2654.16 --> 2658.24
david ike seems sketchy to me but i

2656.319 --> 2660.24
cannot put my finger on why exactly

2658.24 --> 2664.7999999999997
really you can't

2660.24 --> 2667.2799999999997
uh dude he is like a

2664.8 --> 2669.04
he's a conspiracy salesman in his own

2667.28 --> 2670.5600000000004
way he's just like alex jones but he

2669.04 --> 2672.8
does it differently

2670.56 --> 2674.0789999999997
but dude that guy is like really on

2672.8 --> 2676.88
money

2674.079 --> 2678.6400000000003
he is like a

2676.88 --> 2680.2400000000002
yeah

2678.64 --> 2681.2799999999997
he has love for money

2680.24 --> 2684.7999999999997
he does

2681.28 --> 2685.92
i mean not like rockefeller style level

2684.8 --> 2686.7200000000003
i hope

2685.92 --> 2690.16
uh

2686.72 --> 2692.7999999999997
but the guy is really

2690.16 --> 2695.2799999999997
like hoarding money

2692.8 --> 2697.119
making more more more bigger audience

2695.28 --> 2699.2000000000003
more more more

2697.119 --> 2702.1600000000003
and he has all kinds of weird occult

2699.2 --> 2702.16
connections and [ __ ]

2702.4 --> 2705.839
like

2703.44 --> 2709.119
dude that guy is hooked up with secret

2705.839 --> 2711.92
societies maybe not the old ones

2709.119 --> 2713.839
but probably the new ones

2711.92 --> 2717.119
because yeah oh oh you didn't think that

2713.839 --> 2719.2799999999997
happens right all secret societies oh no

2717.119 --> 2722.319
we all know about them and

2719.28 --> 2724.6400000000003
the jesuits and the free masons and and

2722.319 --> 2725.52
you don't think new secret societies pop

2724.64 --> 2728.0789999999997
up

2725.52 --> 2729.2
that new generations might just

2728.079 --> 2730.4
do it

2729.2 --> 2731.2799999999997
yeah they do

2730.4 --> 2733.28
they do

2731.28 --> 2735.6800000000003
and they're taking over wait you think

2733.28 --> 2737.599
that oh we got rid we're getting rid of

2735.68 --> 2739.359
the old secret society oh you think it's

2737.599 --> 2740.96
not gonna be replaced

2739.359 --> 2743.68
ah

2740.96 --> 2745.04
you really think it won't be

2743.68 --> 2749.5989999999997
guess again

2745.04 --> 2749.599
okay and david ike knows that

2749.839 --> 2754.16
and

2750.96 --> 2756.48
he's probably connected like that so

2754.16 --> 2758.319
he's like okay i'm gonna help build the

2756.48 --> 2759.2
new story

2758.319 --> 2761.599
that's

2759.2 --> 2763.2799999999997
like broken off from the new world order

2761.599 --> 2765.28
old story

2763.28 --> 2766.7200000000003
the obsession of like one world

2765.28 --> 2769.76
government

2766.72 --> 2771.2799999999997
ruled by elite uh like like super

2769.76 --> 2773.44
neo-feudalism

2771.28 --> 2776.0
like away from that story but it's still

2773.44 --> 2778.56
secret societies that are busying like

2776.0 --> 2780.16
writing dreams and programs to steer

2778.56 --> 2781.599
people in how the society is going to

2780.16 --> 2784.319
become

2781.599 --> 2788.079
right and david ike does do that

2784.319 --> 2791.119
absolutely he does

2788.079 --> 2792.48
he does it openly i can't say like oh

2791.119 --> 2795.2000000000003
how dare you

2792.48 --> 2798.079
you're secretly trying to program people

2795.2 --> 2801.1189999999997
no he's not secretly he's literally just

2798.079 --> 2802.7200000000003
like openly lectures people pay him to

2801.119 --> 2804.6400000000003
see his lectures

2802.72 --> 2805.5989999999997
where he does it openly

2804.64 --> 2808.0
so

2805.599 --> 2810.88
and yeah from that perspective you could

2808.0 --> 2813.52
say i am a little bit like that too

2810.88 --> 2815.52
i just don't get loads and loads of

2813.52 --> 2817.2
money for it

2815.52 --> 2819.7599999999998
it's the big difference

2817.2 --> 2822.0
wish i had some

2819.76 --> 2825.2000000000003
talking about which please donate to my

2822.0 --> 2827.52
paypal i could really use it

2825.2 --> 2828.96
because i'm going to not be able to

2827.52 --> 2833.599
smoke

2828.96 --> 2836.079
at all this weekend if i don't get any

2833.599 --> 2838.56
not looking forward to that

2836.079 --> 2840.48
so please donate to my paypal

2838.56 --> 2842.48
let me know in chat

2840.48 --> 2845.839
that would be great

2842.48 --> 2845.839
very relieving to me

2846.16 --> 2850.96
i met david i glanced yeah me too i met

2848.72 --> 2854.0
him like a long time ago

2850.96 --> 2856.319
in 2010

2854.0 --> 2859.04
i think

2856.319 --> 2860.8
in like in the netherlands it was like a

2859.04 --> 2863.7599999999998
little thing

2860.8 --> 2864.7200000000003
like an alternative news

2863.76 --> 2866.8
fair

2864.72 --> 2869.1189999999997
you could say it was like a fair and he

2866.8 --> 2872.0
was there too and there i even spoke to

2869.119 --> 2873.6800000000003
him personally

2872.0 --> 2875.44
and confronted him with flat earth and

2873.68 --> 2876.64
then he said no no

2875.44 --> 2879.28
i'm like

2876.64 --> 2882.16
he literally said it like this

2879.28 --> 2883.92
you might be on to something but

2882.16 --> 2885.7599999999998
it might be paraphrase but he said

2883.92 --> 2888.16
effectively that you might be on to

2885.76 --> 2889.5200000000004
something but it's i'm not gonna go

2888.16 --> 2891.359
there

2889.52 --> 2892.64
right so he wasn't like you're crazy

2891.359 --> 2895.52
it's not flat

2892.64 --> 2899.16
he was not like that he's just like nope

2895.52 --> 2899.16
not gonna do that

2912.16 --> 2916.16
yes you could afford luck big bad yeah

2914.559 --> 2919.119
yeah

2916.16 --> 2922.8799999999997
i'm not saying he's a bad person pjc net

2919.119 --> 2925.839
i'm just saying he is like ambitious and

2922.88 --> 2928.559
yeah he's not like oh bragging with his

2925.839 --> 2929.839
money he's not like that at all but he

2928.559 --> 2932.1600000000003
is like

2929.839 --> 2935.119
always just like

2932.16 --> 2936.7999999999997
expanding expanding what he's doing more

2935.119 --> 2939.52
public more

2936.8 --> 2941.599
lectures more people in those lectures

2939.52 --> 2944.96
more books

2941.599 --> 2948.7200000000003
he is like ambitious with it and it does

2944.96 --> 2951.119
like it does give a ring of money

2948.72 --> 2951.1189999999997
to me

2951.2 --> 2955.359
he definitely has that as a priority in

2953.839 --> 2957.599
what he's doing

2955.359 --> 2960.0
maybe not the number one priority but it

2957.599 --> 2960.0
is there

2968.079 --> 2971.48
is this

2979.599 --> 2984.2400000000002
craters are never blue

2981.839 --> 2986.7999999999997
oh really

2984.24 --> 2989.4399999999996
moon craters are never blue

2986.8 --> 2992.559
oh really how about the new moon

2989.44 --> 2997.0
huh how about the new moon are the

2992.559 --> 2997.0
craters never blew them

3011.44 --> 3017.04
really

3013.04 --> 3017.04
ike is likely a reptilian

3018.8 --> 3024.8
that's kind of funny i don't think so

3022.48 --> 3028.4
i don't think reptilians are actually

3024.8 --> 3031.52
beings i think that they're spirits

3028.4 --> 3035.839
and that your own soul and spirit can

3031.52 --> 3037.68
basically be converted to reptilian

3035.839 --> 3040.88
but it is not a

3037.68 --> 3043.44
a a separate being

3040.88 --> 3047.6400000000003
i think that's a bit of a reification on

3043.44 --> 3047.64
david david ike's part

3089.839 --> 3093.7999999999997
get the [ __ ] out of here

3103.28 --> 3107.28
banjo boo

3104.72 --> 3109.04
you're just timed out but uh

3107.28 --> 3110.48
yeah the thing is

3109.04 --> 3112.48
this was a

3110.48 --> 3115.04
a response

3112.48 --> 3118.16
to somebody saying earlier

3115.04 --> 3120.8
you only see the bright parts the moon

3118.16 --> 3122.64
craters are never blue

3120.8 --> 3124.8
except when you don't see the whole

3122.64 --> 3125.92
thing that was the point that's the

3124.8 --> 3128.0
counter

3125.92 --> 3129.28
to prove that that statement is just

3128.0 --> 3131.52
wrong

3129.28 --> 3133.52
like most baller

3131.52 --> 3136.079
apologist statements

3133.52 --> 3138.559
they're just wrong

3136.079 --> 3141.2000000000003
you're just incorrect the moon is not

3138.559 --> 3142.96
even a physical object just

3141.2 --> 3146.48
suggestive

3142.96 --> 3146.48
appearance that is all

3149.44 --> 3155.599
it's just that one little lunatic

3152.64 --> 3159.2799999999997
illusion in your face that can [ __ ] you

3155.599 --> 3161.28
up if you choose it to let it right

3159.28 --> 3162.7200000000003
that's what the moon can do what you

3161.28 --> 3165.44
want to believe

3162.72 --> 3166.7999999999997
that that is the proof of heliocentrism

3165.44 --> 3168.4
that it's all like that because the moon

3166.8 --> 3171.92
looks like that well that's your

3168.4 --> 3174.1600000000003
prerogative you can let the moon

3171.92 --> 3175.839
the moon's visage

3174.16 --> 3178.24
[ __ ] you up

3175.839 --> 3180.48
and make you believe

3178.24 --> 3183.1189999999997
that it's all a bunch of balls floating

3180.48 --> 3186.2400000000002
in a vacuum yeah you can do that you can

3183.119 --> 3191.28
let the moon make you into a lunatic

3186.24 --> 3191.2799999999997
if you choose to i choose not to

3192.079 --> 3197.52
yes i am price of adam

3195.28 --> 3197.52
what

3197.599 --> 3200.88
did you how would you not

3206.839 --> 3212.48
know oh you're on paypal okay that's

3210.24 --> 3212.4799999999996
good

3219.839 --> 3224.0
but yes

3221.119 --> 3227.92

3224.0 --> 3230.0
my name registered there is paul paul

3227.92 --> 3233.64
come

3230.0 --> 3233.64
that's what it is

3244.69 --> 3252.559
[Music]

3247.68 --> 3253.68
delete the truth delete the truth

3252.559 --> 3254.96
except

3253.68 --> 3257.7599999999998
i didn't

3254.96 --> 3258.8
i just deleted a straw man response

3257.76 --> 3260.48
another

3258.8 --> 3263.6800000000003
rabbit trail

3260.48 --> 3264.96
to move away from that it even was a

3263.68 --> 3266.7999999999997
response

3264.96 --> 3267.68
to a statement

3266.8 --> 3271.04
oh

3267.68 --> 3273.9199999999996
the craters the presupposed craters of

3271.04 --> 3275.92
the presupposed spherical moon

3273.92 --> 3278.319
they never turn blue

3275.92 --> 3279.6800000000003
except for during the new moon that was

3278.319 --> 3282.24
the point

3279.68 --> 3285.359
and if you're then gonna migrate away

3282.24 --> 3286.9599999999996
from that oh that that means yeah that

3285.359 --> 3288.319
means you're a straw manning piece of

3286.96 --> 3292.04
[ __ ] troll

3288.319 --> 3292.04
that's what that means

3297.52 --> 3301.599
oh

3298.72 --> 3304.64
thank you adam price

3301.599 --> 3306.4
thank you that is extremely helpful

3304.64 --> 3307.359
that now at least get me through this

3306.4 --> 3310.7200000000003
weekend

3307.359 --> 3310.72
thank you thank you so much

3316.799 --> 3321.839
thank god

3318.319 --> 3321.839
thank god i have you guys

3327.2 --> 3333.5589999999997
i had it this time

3330.24 --> 3333.5589999999997
what do you mean

3344.48 --> 3348.88
it's not there then bam it is anyone

3347.04 --> 3352.319
else see that

3348.88 --> 3352.319
why does the moon have faces

3353.119 --> 3358.6800000000003
uh

3354.319 --> 3358.68
why do fingers have nails

3362.799 --> 3369.92
why do men grow mustaches

3366.88 --> 3372.079
what like what the [ __ ]

3369.92 --> 3374.2400000000002
why why would you assume that we would

3372.079 --> 3378.7200000000003
know

3374.24 --> 3380.5589999999997
it's a sky clock the faces are obviously

3378.72 --> 3382.8799999999997
deducible to be

3380.559 --> 3384.6400000000003
function of the sky clock and that's it

3382.88 --> 3388.48
it's like the most obvious function of

3384.64 --> 3391.359
the sky clock the moon is the biggest

3388.48 --> 3393.52
celestial visible

3391.359 --> 3395.359
that is distinguishable even for people

3393.52 --> 3397.119
that don't have like the most amazing

3395.359 --> 3400.0789999999997
eyesight

3397.119 --> 3401.599
and it is palpably it's like very

3400.079 --> 3405.2000000000003
visually

3401.599 --> 3408.799
detectable the phases so it is like the

3405.2 --> 3408.799
primary sky clock

3409.119 --> 3411.28
gauge

3410.319 --> 3413.38
right

3411.28 --> 3416.679
primary

3413.38 --> 3416.679
[Music]

3418.16 --> 3420.64
english

3422.94 --> 3425.9790000000003
[Music]

3429.45 --> 3433.839
[Music]

3431.119 --> 3435.44
a clock hand right so the moon is

3433.839 --> 3437.7599999999998
effectively

3435.44 --> 3440.319
the primary clock hand it's the most

3437.76 --> 3440.3190000000004
visible

3440.48 --> 3443.44
and it is the most

3447.04 --> 3453.68
the most basic it's just full empty full

3450.24 --> 3456.16
empty full empty and it is yeah always

3453.68 --> 3458.96
going in a cycle so it's like

3456.16 --> 3460.64
the primary sky clock

3458.96 --> 3463.119
my the primary

3460.64 --> 3465.359
clock hand of the sky clock because

3463.119 --> 3467.119
everything else is too it's just that

3465.359 --> 3468.96
the moon is the most visible it's the

3467.119 --> 3470.48
first thing that will

3468.96 --> 3473.04
show to you

3470.48 --> 3476.48
a cyclical persistent nature

3473.04 --> 3476.48
which is a trait of a clock

3476.799 --> 3482.4
giving money to arwen is money well

3478.24 --> 3482.3999999999996
spent i like to think so mike definitely

3483.2 --> 3489.4399999999996
like it's revolving around a light it's

3486.559 --> 3491.52
no it's not anything it's a hologram

3489.44 --> 3493.68
john smith it's a hologram it's not

3491.52 --> 3497.2
actually an object

3493.68 --> 3500.0
it just has this weird suggestiveness to

3497.2 --> 3501.52
it with these apparent

3500.0 --> 3503.68
seeming like

3501.52 --> 3505.52
shadow effects and it's all very

3503.68 --> 3508.0
confusing

3505.52 --> 3510.559
and it's probably confusing on purpose

3508.0 --> 3514.319
to [ __ ] you up

3510.559 --> 3516.48
to [ __ ] you up in your mind

3514.319 --> 3518.88
that's why they call it a lunatic

3516.48 --> 3521.839
and i think it's there on purpose it's

3518.88 --> 3524.48
on purpose like oh oh you think you know

3521.839 --> 3526.799
everything look at the moon

3524.48 --> 3530.0
look at the moon and see if you really

3526.799 --> 3531.2
think you know everything yeah

3530.0 --> 3532.799
you don't

3531.2 --> 3535.2799999999997
you don't understand anything of it

3532.799 --> 3537.92
that's a lie radar does not bounce off

3535.28 --> 3540.4
it it's [ __ ] it doesn't do that

3537.92 --> 3543.04
there's no demonstration of that

3540.4 --> 3545.839
i've had people blabbering on about that

3543.04 --> 3550.799
claim for years

3545.839 --> 3553.119
years nobody has ever one single time

3550.799 --> 3556.559
actually shown me a viable demonstration

3553.119 --> 3558.88
of doing that not a single time no video

3556.559 --> 3561.92
that was ever shown to me

3558.88 --> 3563.28
actually demonstrated doing that

3561.92 --> 3566.64
it's a lie

3563.28 --> 3568.7200000000003
it's a made up lie

3566.64 --> 3571.359
why do people say it's been done because

3568.72 --> 3574.64
they're [ __ ] liars that's why they're

3571.359 --> 3576.4
liars they want it to be real they're

3574.64 --> 3578.8799999999997
afraid that if they point out that it

3576.4 --> 3580.88
isn't real that oh no you're a stupid

3578.88 --> 3582.7200000000003
flat earther right oh you're fired from

3580.88 --> 3585.28
your job you're not gonna get your

3582.72 --> 3586.8799999999997
pension money

3585.28 --> 3590.2400000000002
that's why

3586.88 --> 3591.2000000000003
they lie for money

3590.24 --> 3593.52
that's

3591.2 --> 3593.52
why

3595.52 --> 3599.839
i've got you with my hammer no you're a

3597.04 --> 3601.2
liar you haven't done that john smith

3599.839 --> 3603.599
you're a liar

3601.2 --> 3607.04
and i'm gonna ban you now yeah you're a

3603.599 --> 3610.319
liar get the [ __ ] out of my chat liar

3607.04 --> 3611.839
you're a liar i know you are a liar

3610.319 --> 3615.839
because you're saying oh i've done it

3611.839 --> 3615.839
with my home radio no you're a liar

3616.48 --> 3620.4
i know this

3617.92 --> 3622.7200000000003
i will literally

3620.4 --> 3626.559
wager my life

3622.72 --> 3627.52
on that you are a liar right now about

3626.559 --> 3628.96
that

3627.52 --> 3630.319
john smith

3628.96 --> 3632.64
liar

3630.319 --> 3637.5589999999997
i will wage my life

3632.64 --> 3637.5589999999997
on that you are lying right now

3644.559 --> 3655.2400000000002
i will i will wage my life on it

3648.88 --> 3655.2400000000002
may god strike me dead if i'm wrong

3657.07 --> 3660.239
[Music]

3664.24 --> 3667.52
yeah i'm sure he's done other things

3665.839 --> 3670.96
with his ham radio

3667.52 --> 3673.52
she got it up his ass

3670.96 --> 3673.52
no doubt

3675.68 --> 3681.7599999999998
what he has not done is a moon signal

3679.28 --> 3684.559
rebounds because it makes no [ __ ]

3681.76 --> 3687.3590000000004
sense it's never been demonstrated

3684.559 --> 3689.3590000000004
since freaking radio was invented it has

3687.359 --> 3693.359
not been physically

3689.359 --> 3695.7599999999998
live demonstrated by a single individual

3693.359 --> 3699.68
in earth's history

3695.76 --> 3703.44
nobody has ever actually demonstrated it

3699.68 --> 3704.64
only claimed blah blah blah calculus

3703.44 --> 3708.079
garbage

3704.64 --> 3711.5989999999997
and people just [ __ ] lying lying like

3708.079 --> 3713.44
scumbags lying scumbags

3711.599 --> 3717.599
saying you've done something that you

3713.44 --> 3720.16
haven't you [ __ ] liar wrought in hell

3717.599 --> 3720.1600000000003
liar

3720.96 --> 3730.119
why don't you [ __ ] demonstrate it

3724.599 --> 3730.119
demonstrate it then liner

3760.72 --> 3764.72
hello akumu virus that's a ridiculous

3763.119 --> 3766.96
question

3764.72 --> 3769.839
and i'm not gonna wonder about that with

3766.96 --> 3769.839
you thanks

3773.839 --> 3780.64
but yeah jarvis i will definitely wager

3776.4 --> 3780.64
my life on that i absolutely will

3780.72 --> 3784.9599999999996
i would put my head on the chopping

3783.68 --> 3788.0789999999997
block

3784.96 --> 3789.839
with the executioner and his ex

3788.079 --> 3791.8390000000004
raised up

3789.839 --> 3792.96
i would do that

3791.839 --> 3795.68
and then

3792.96 --> 3798.16
somebody shows me it

3795.68 --> 3801.359
satisfactory i will die

3798.16 --> 3804.799
i will do that because i know it's a lie

3801.359 --> 3807.839
i know it's impossible i know it cannot

3804.799 --> 3809.52
be done and i've never seen a single

3807.839 --> 3812.24
demonstration

3809.52 --> 3813.52
and i've shouted at people over it a lot

3812.24 --> 3814.799
and i've

3813.52 --> 3817.359
hung out

3814.799 --> 3819.92
on shows where ballers and all that

3817.359 --> 3821.839
piece of [ __ ] all these scumbags with

3819.92 --> 3825.039
all their expensive

3821.839 --> 3826.0789999999997
social likes nasa socialism equipment

3825.039 --> 3828.6400000000003
yeah

3826.079 --> 3831.6800000000003
nobody's ever actually demonstrated that

3828.64 --> 3834.48
a single time just a bunch of whining s

3831.68 --> 3836.3999999999996
incessant whining about it blah blah

3834.48 --> 3838.4
blah you're stupid you just don't know

3836.4 --> 3841.839
look it up just google it

3838.4 --> 3845.2000000000003
yeah no video no video ever has

3841.839 --> 3848.88
demonstrated doing that never ever and

3845.2 --> 3850.319
i've really tried i really tried digging

3848.88 --> 3852.4
it isn't there

3850.319 --> 3854.72
it's never been done

3852.4 --> 3856.48
oh you might have rolled into a piece of

3854.72 --> 3859.9199999999996
[ __ ] machination

3856.48 --> 3862.079
one time oh just come to our building we

3859.92 --> 3862.88
will demonstrate how it works and then

3862.079 --> 3864.88
they

3862.88 --> 3867.359
have some machine and they just say oh

3864.88 --> 3870.4
look see it's happening right now

3867.359 --> 3872.0
and i'll bet you i will bet you a

3870.4 --> 3875.44
million

3872.0 --> 3878.48
that you wouldn't even see the moon as

3875.44 --> 3882.16
they claim it yeah they wouldn't even

3878.48 --> 3885.599
have the moon in the sky

3882.16 --> 3888.0
when they tell you it's being done yeah

3885.599 --> 3889.2000000000003
that's how [ __ ] stupid they think you

3888.0 --> 3891.52
are

3889.2 --> 3893.2799999999997
yeah you're a bunch of ball [ __ ] [ __ ]

3891.52 --> 3895.839
retards

3893.28 --> 3898.079
that's how stupid they think you are

3895.839 --> 3900.96
when they tell you we're doing it right

3898.079 --> 3902.319
now you will not even see the moon in

3900.96 --> 3905.359
the sky

3902.319 --> 3907.839
you goddamn idiots

3905.359 --> 3909.839
and you'll still buy it and then you'll

3907.839 --> 3915.16
blabber on about it like a [ __ ]

3909.839 --> 3915.16
[ __ ] in chats claiming that it's done

3927.44 --> 3932.7200000000003
oh no that's stupid thing to say jarvis

3930.48 --> 3933.76
i've had elaborate

3932.72 --> 3936.9599999999996
shows

3933.76 --> 3940.079
entire shows dedicated to explaining

3936.96 --> 3941.28
exactly what you would need

3940.079 --> 3943.76
to do

3941.28 --> 3945.039
to attain actual evidence that it is

3943.76 --> 3946.3190000000004
possible

3945.039 --> 3948.559
yeah

3946.319 --> 3952.4
now that you can't figure that out on

3948.559 --> 3954.4
the fly that's your incompetence i

3952.4 --> 3957.6800000000003
definitely would know how you would

3954.4 --> 3962.079
demonstrate it if it were possible

3957.68 --> 3962.839
yeah you need three cameras three

3962.079 --> 3967.6800000000003
one

3962.839 --> 3970.799
camera stuck to the handheld radio

3967.68 --> 3974.3999999999996
signal aiming device

3970.799 --> 3976.88
so that you can point it at the moon in

3974.4 --> 3981.44
the sky

3976.88 --> 3987.6800000000003
and then see the moon in the sky as you

3981.44 --> 3988.559
aim the radar radio device signal thing

3987.68 --> 3992.48
yeah

3988.559 --> 3995.2000000000003
then you have another camera pointed at

3992.48 --> 3996.92
the screen readout

3995.2 --> 3999.52
yeah that will

3996.92 --> 4002.0
interactively show you

3999.52 --> 4005.44
on that screen whether there is a bounce

4002.0 --> 4007.44
of any kind right how do you do that

4005.44 --> 4011.119
well it's very simple you move the

4007.44 --> 4013.839
[ __ ] radar aiming thing around you

4011.119 --> 4015.52
point it at the ground the signal

4013.839 --> 4019.599
feedback on the second camera

4015.52 --> 4022.64
immediately shows oh see bound rebound

4019.599 --> 4026.0
you point at the sky no rebound and then

4022.64 --> 4029.7599999999998
you point it at the moon

4026.0 --> 4032.24
and then there should be whoop

4029.76 --> 4034.559
or at least once right you should have

4032.24 --> 4036.3999999999996
one pulse at some point as you point it

4034.559 --> 4038.48
try to point it at the moon

4036.4 --> 4039.92
yeah you should have that at least once

4038.48 --> 4042.799
that's how you prove it yeah and then

4039.92 --> 4044.16
you have the third camera

4042.799 --> 4046.0
is slightly

4044.16 --> 4049.68
to the backdrop

4046.0 --> 4051.68
filming you holding the aiming thing

4049.68 --> 4054.16
doing that

4051.68 --> 4058.3999999999996
and the computer

4054.16 --> 4061.92
showing the readout in a single shot

4058.4 --> 4065.52
three cameras one for the signal aim one

4061.92 --> 4068.559
for the readout one to show it all live

4065.52 --> 4073.0389999999998
in a singular unedited shot

4068.559 --> 4075.8390000000004
that's how you demonstrate it it doesn't

4073.039 --> 4079.119
exist it's not been done it shouldn't be

4075.839 --> 4080.16
hard to do this it dude you could do all

4079.119 --> 4083.28
of that

4080.16 --> 4085.92
like under a budget of

4083.28 --> 4087.599
probably a thousand euros

4085.92 --> 4090.64
that's peanuts

4087.599 --> 4092.0
for nasa socialist pieces of [ __ ] guys

4090.64 --> 4093.68
peanuts

4092.0 --> 4095.28
they got that money

4093.68 --> 4097.12
like

4095.28 --> 4098.96
they find that sort of money between

4097.12 --> 4101.44
their couch okay

4098.96 --> 4102.719
it's [ __ ] it's never been done it

4101.44 --> 4105.04
should be done

4102.719 --> 4107.44
instead people are just claiming and

4105.04 --> 4109.2789999999995
claiming and claiming oh it's been done

4107.44 --> 4111.199
it's possible really because somebody

4109.279 --> 4113.1990000000005
said it to me i'm a [ __ ] [ __ ] that

4111.199 --> 4114.719
didn't actually want a logical

4113.199 --> 4116.879999999999
demonstration

4114.719 --> 4118.56
yes we know you're a [ __ ] [ __ ] that

4116.88 --> 4123.359
didn't want any actual logical

4118.56 --> 4123.359
demonstration we know you're a baltard

4131.6 --> 4134.4800000000005
so there you go

4135.229 --> 4139.52
[Music]

4136.88 --> 4140.939
that's how you do it jarvis i hope you

4139.52 --> 4144.119000000001
paid attention

4140.939 --> 4144.119000000001
[Music]

4146.159 --> 4151.599999999999
no no no that's no you don't understand

4149.12 --> 4154.3189999999995
jarvis you're you're quite incompetent

4151.6 --> 4158.0
here right now

4154.319 --> 4158.0
you're being quite incompetent

4158.64 --> 4161.839
really

4159.52 --> 4163.839000000001
you understand can you give me feedback

4161.839 --> 4165.12
why how you replied in that last

4163.839 --> 4167.839
sentence

4165.12 --> 4170.64
yeah at 3 15

4167.839 --> 4172.96
why you are incompetent responding like

4170.64 --> 4176.56
that can you can you give me feedback on

4172.96 --> 4180.719
that or anybody else in this chat

4176.56 --> 4180.719
why is that an incompetent thing to say

4180.88 --> 4185.4400000000005
then you could still

4182.48 --> 4188.0
lie to you by showing you a fake screen

4185.44 --> 4189.678999999999
readout they made in advance why is that

4188.0 --> 4190.96
an incompetent

4189.679 --> 4193.4400000000005
thing

4190.96 --> 4193.44
to say

4199.36 --> 4203.92
do you know jarvis

4201.04 --> 4207.04
have you realized by now why that is an

4203.92 --> 4210.32
incompetent thing to say

4207.04 --> 4210.32
can you feed that back to me

4217.52 --> 4224.0
now it's good to think ahead yeah yeah

4219.36 --> 4224.0
but it's wrong you know why it's wrong

4226.56 --> 4233.96
you're not gonna figure it why uh

4230.78 --> 4233.96
[Music]

4235.52 --> 4240.2390000000005
is everybody like

4237.52 --> 4241.4400000000005
capped out at 100 iq here or something

4240.239 --> 4244.48
serious

4241.44 --> 4247.5199999999995
why can't people immediate like if i was

4244.48 --> 4249.959999999999
in this chat of my own show right now as

4247.52 --> 4254.0
another person that is me i would

4249.96 --> 4255.76
immediately immediately like a maniac

4254.0 --> 4257.52
instantly type the answer to that

4255.76 --> 4260.159000000001
question

4257.52 --> 4260.159000000001
instantly

4266.8 --> 4274.08
no no it wouldn't was it

4269.76 --> 4276.96
you're incompetent too you know why

4274.08 --> 4279.12
false meter rita yeah you know why that

4276.96 --> 4282.4800000000005
is stupid

4279.12 --> 4282.48
remember the setup

4282.88 --> 4286.0
and

4284.08 --> 4290.32
held

4286.0 --> 4294.08
radar or signal aiming device

4290.32 --> 4296.4
with camera on it to show you exactly

4294.08 --> 4300.64
where it's abling visually

4296.4 --> 4304.48
why would that make absolutely no sense

4300.64 --> 4306.88
to think that a meter reading would be

4304.48 --> 4306.879999999999
faked

4307.76 --> 4311.1990000000005
because it's

4309.28 --> 4313.12
live

4311.199 --> 4315.36
live

4313.12 --> 4318.48
you're doing it live

4315.36 --> 4320.08
the readout is happening live if it's

4318.48 --> 4323.04
rigged

4320.08 --> 4324.8
if it was a pre-programmed thing oh now

4323.04 --> 4327.199
sent the pulse at this second and then

4324.8 --> 4329.92
go away like that yeah

4327.199 --> 4331.678999999999
you would see that

4329.92 --> 4334.4
i mean

4331.679 --> 4336.8
just like go like

4334.4 --> 4339.12
if there is no live response on the

4336.8 --> 4340.320000000001
signal readout yeah then it's rigged

4339.12 --> 4344.159
yeah

4340.32 --> 4347.12
that's why it has to be live

4344.159 --> 4350.799999999999
not just oh a device

4347.12 --> 4354.08
it has a very specific preset direction

4350.8 --> 4358.159000000001
for the signal oh look we're turning it

4354.08 --> 4360.4
on see there's a signal rebound

4358.159 --> 4362.48
oh wait there's no moon in the sky oh

4360.4 --> 4364.96
don't think about that this is a signal

4362.48 --> 4366.32
rebound it's there really

4364.96 --> 4368.2390000000005
yeah

4366.32 --> 4369.96
that's why it has to be

4368.239 --> 4374.08
live

4369.96 --> 4377.44
re-aiming so you can interactively check

4374.08 --> 4381.199
whether there is a rebound live

4377.44 --> 4384.0
on the signal readout and all of it on a

4381.199 --> 4386.159
singular camera

4384.0 --> 4389.12
singular camera seeing both

4386.159 --> 4392.0
the readout happening live and the

4389.12 --> 4394.88
person holding the aiming device

4392.0 --> 4397.679
moving it around hopefully maybe even

4394.88 --> 4401.679
the moon in the shot in the background

4397.679 --> 4403.679
that would top it all off perfectly yeah

4401.679 --> 4405.92
it doesn't make any sense that you can't

4403.679 --> 4408.2390000000005
read that if it's a live readout it's

4405.92 --> 4412.56
like you would see that immediately that

4408.239 --> 4415.28
it's rigged because it's a live readout

4412.56 --> 4417.360000000001
that's the point that's why i devised

4415.28 --> 4420.4
that setup

4417.36 --> 4421.679
because saying oh we have a thing it's

4420.4 --> 4423.36
aiming

4421.679 --> 4424.84
at a steady

4423.36 --> 4427.12
position a

4424.84 --> 4428.719
signal oh here's the readout that

4427.12 --> 4431.04
doesn't do anything

4428.719 --> 4433.679
it doesn't mean anything if you can't

4431.04 --> 4434.88
vary and manipulate the actual signal

4433.679 --> 4437.36
direction

4434.88 --> 4440.159000000001
it's all [ __ ]

4437.36 --> 4442.4
you have to be able to live aim it and

4440.159 --> 4443.839999999999
then boom here's the reader oh look i'm

4442.4 --> 4446.159
aiming at the moon

4443.84 --> 4448.64
there you go signal feedback aiming not

4446.159 --> 4448.639999999999
at the moon

4450.4 --> 4452.32
that's

4451.44 --> 4455.759999999999
live

4452.32 --> 4458.799999999999
live live live if that's faked you would

4455.76 --> 4463.0
immediately see it that's the point

4458.8 --> 4463.0
that's the point of that setup

4480.8 --> 4485.1990000000005
we'll do it live is that a

4483.28 --> 4486.48
yeah that's a reference to what's the

4485.199 --> 4488.4
guy

4486.48 --> 4490.159
it's a that's cnn

4488.4 --> 4492.5599999999995
news reader

4490.159 --> 4495.12
you also got really angry about the

4492.56 --> 4495.120000000001
hammering

4495.44 --> 4499.599999999999
it's like the cnn guy from the 90s right

4500.8 --> 4505.360000000001
or is it fox news or so i don't know i

4502.8 --> 4507.76
don't really care

4505.36 --> 4510.32
right so now you know now you've heard

4507.76 --> 4512.400000000001
it you've heard my case again i mean

4510.32 --> 4515.36
this is like the sixth or seventh time

4512.4 --> 4517.12
that i've addressed this again

4515.36 --> 4519.36
people don't it doesn't seem to stick

4517.12 --> 4520.64
somehow it just goes away again and

4519.36 --> 4522.799999999999
people oh

4520.64 --> 4525.6
signal rebounds that's the signal

4522.8 --> 4528.320000000001
rebound disproven i'm a [ __ ] liar

4525.6 --> 4531.92
because i'm claiming that i've done that

4528.32 --> 4533.36
yeah you're a [ __ ] liar yeah we know

4531.92 --> 4535.52
you literally didn't even know what

4533.36 --> 4538.239
you're doing or you were just straight

4535.52 --> 4541.52
out lying about it to virtual signal to

4538.239 --> 4543.919999999999
your [ __ ] religion

4541.52 --> 4546.080000000001
bill o'reilly fox news right yeah it's

4543.92 --> 4547.52
fox news sorry bill o'reilly you do it

4546.08 --> 4549.679
live

4547.52 --> 4552.56
that was great

4549.679 --> 4554.08
that guy was so freaking angry but i

4552.56 --> 4556.0
kind of liked it

4554.08 --> 4558.4
not that i really liked watching a show

4556.0 --> 4560.719
or anything it's

4558.4 --> 4563.12
you know i can't appreciate just that

4560.719 --> 4563.12
level

4565.04 --> 4570.159
maybe bob the science guy once yeah but

4566.8 --> 4573.12
you know you know he'd spend act he

4570.159 --> 4576.159
would spend like five thousand dollars

4573.12 --> 4578.239
to do it wrong on purpose

4576.159 --> 4580.719
and then he will say oh flat earth are

4578.239 --> 4583.36
you gonna do it i spent five thousand

4580.719 --> 4585.84
dollars on doing this oh but you got it

4583.36 --> 4588.239
wrong no no you just don't understand

4585.84 --> 4590.32
why don't you do it better then oh you

4588.239 --> 4592.718999999999
pay all that money

4590.32 --> 4595.239
you do it that's what they do they'd

4592.719 --> 4598.32
always do it wrong they spend

4595.239 --> 4600.48
excessively to do it wrong and then

4598.32 --> 4603.44
complain to flat earthers why don't you

4600.48 --> 4606.08
do it then why don't you waste your

4603.44 --> 4608.239
money that you don't have excessively

4606.08 --> 4611.28
because you're not a nasa socialist

4608.239 --> 4612.239
scumbag like us anti-flat earthers piece

4611.28 --> 4614.32
of [ __ ]

4612.239 --> 4616.959999999999
why don't you spend all your money on

4614.32 --> 4619.44
doing this stupid thing

4616.96 --> 4621.12
to prove our religion which you don't

4619.44 --> 4623.36
give a [ __ ] about

4621.12 --> 4625.5199999999995
what did you do it that's what they do

4623.36 --> 4627.599999999999
they just want you to [ __ ] kill

4625.52 --> 4629.92
yourself by wasting your money on

4627.6 --> 4632.0
nonsense

4629.92 --> 4633.84
that's what they want to do

4632.0 --> 4635.6
that's what they do they always do it

4633.84 --> 4636.400000000001
wrong to make you

4635.6 --> 4639.1990000000005
spend

4636.4 --> 4642.799999999999
your money on [ __ ]

4639.199 --> 4644.96
is what anti-flat earthers do

4642.8 --> 4646.96
he would not call fight yeah he would

4644.96 --> 4649.92
make it cost that

4646.96 --> 4652.32
as i said he would spend excessively to

4649.92 --> 4654.159
do it wrong

4652.32 --> 4655.44
he would

4654.159 --> 4657.36
right

4655.44 --> 4659.639999999999
they're not going to pay a minimum

4657.36 --> 4663.679
amount to do it right now they will pay

4659.64 --> 4664.88
excessively to do it wrong it's the nasa

4663.679 --> 4667.1990000000005
way

4664.88 --> 4670.96
you see

4667.199 --> 4673.199
hello nathan oakley 1980 good to see you

4670.96 --> 4676.199
level bastard

4673.199 --> 4676.199
hello

4687.44 --> 4691.199
all right so

4688.96 --> 4694.159
yeah if anybody

4691.199 --> 4695.199
wants to take my challenge up on it you

4694.159 --> 4697.199
know

4695.199 --> 4699.36
moon signal rebounds you think that's

4697.199 --> 4700.48
really you're gonna do that you really

4699.36 --> 4701.44
think so

4700.48 --> 4704.32
well

4701.44 --> 4708.5599999999995
listen to my description of how to do it

4704.32 --> 4710.48
i talked about it again i have a show

4708.56 --> 4712.2390000000005
that's specifically dedicated in early

4710.48 --> 4715.199
virtue it's from way back so you'll have

4712.239 --> 4717.678999999999
to scroll like maybe a few years even

4715.199 --> 4719.5199999999995
through my shows but it has there is a

4717.679 --> 4722.159
show with the title

4719.52 --> 4724.88
moon signal rebounds

4722.159 --> 4726.08
it is it is among there

4724.88 --> 4728.400000000001
so

4726.08 --> 4730.08
i yeah i've dedicated a show earlier oh

4728.4 --> 4731.04
happy birthday

4730.08 --> 4734.36
what

4731.04 --> 4734.36
it's your birthday

4735.76 --> 4740.2390000000005
huh yeah happy birthday i didn't know

4738.0 --> 4740.239
that

4742.239 --> 4746.159
how did you know that lbg

4757.199 --> 4762.04
i always get calls when i'm watching

4759.04 --> 4762.04
this

4766.08 --> 4771.92
anyway yeah again if somebody wants to

4768.88 --> 4773.4400000000005
droid spilled to be oh okay

4771.92 --> 4777.4
i didn't see that

4773.44 --> 4777.4
was that in another chat

4777.44 --> 4781.759999999999
fine anyway

4779.12 --> 4783.92
yeah hey baller you really think that

4781.76 --> 4786.400000000001
the moon is physical and by the way i am

4783.92 --> 4789.1990000000005
not super invested

4786.4 --> 4792.32
in it being holographic necessarily i

4789.199 --> 4795.5199999999995
mean my model pretty much assumes it

4792.32 --> 4797.759999999999
and it seems the most logical

4795.52 --> 4798.88
maybe it's just not entirely correct

4797.76 --> 4799.679
though

4798.88 --> 4803.719
i

4799.679 --> 4803.719
how would i find out

4809.28 --> 4812.08
right

4810.48 --> 4813.44
if somebody can

4812.08 --> 4815.92
demonstrate

4813.44 --> 4817.12
it exactly the way that i've laid it

4815.92 --> 4819.84
yeah

4817.12 --> 4819.84
what is all this

4821.28 --> 4826.48
oh yeah i got a lot of boats

4823.6 --> 4829.120000000001
in the sky there but yeah you wanna

4826.48 --> 4832.08
prove the moon rebounds as a signal

4829.12 --> 4833.599999999999
would that make you feel special well

4832.08 --> 4836.32
i've

4833.6 --> 4839.1990000000005
laid out exactly how you would need to

4836.32 --> 4842.32
demonstrate that to a way that i would

4839.199 --> 4842.32
find it acceptable

4842.48 --> 4846.5599999999995
i don't know about other people but a

4844.4 --> 4849.92
live demonstration where the moon is

4846.56 --> 4851.280000000001
inside and you're literally live aiming

4849.92 --> 4853.76
the signal

4851.28 --> 4856.0
with a live readout feedback whether

4853.76 --> 4859.04
there's a connection or not that's how

4856.0 --> 4860.96
you can start to demonstrate to me that

4859.04 --> 4862.48
well the moon might be physical after

4860.96 --> 4865.04
all right

4862.48 --> 4865.919999999999
so you start aiming the

4865.04 --> 4868.639
thing

4865.92 --> 4870.0
this the signal sending device

4868.639 --> 4872.639
the radio

4870.0 --> 4875.52
you aim it at solid things at a tree at

4872.639 --> 4877.92
a mountain at the distance at the ground

4875.52 --> 4880.320000000001
at the empty sky

4877.92 --> 4882.56
and to see how is the signal radar how

4880.32 --> 4886.159
is it working what is it getting as a

4882.56 --> 4887.76
feedback and then you aim it at the moon

4886.159 --> 4888.638999999999
it's that simple

4887.76 --> 4889.52
all

4888.639 --> 4893.12
live

4889.52 --> 4897.360000000001
visual on camera in a singular shot

4893.12 --> 4897.36
with a combination of three cameras

4898.0 --> 4903.76
that's it that is the way to demonstrate

4900.96 --> 4905.6
it's the only sensible viable way to

4903.76 --> 4907.6
demonstrate whether that is possible or

4905.6 --> 4909.4400000000005
not any other

4907.6 --> 4913.52
setup suggestion

4909.44 --> 4915.12
is going to be a lie a deceptive

4913.52 --> 4917.080000000001
machination

4915.12 --> 4919.28
i guarantee it i

4917.08 --> 4920.639
guarantee it

4919.28 --> 4923.599999999999
guarantee

4920.639 --> 4925.36
only one way to properly demonstrate

4923.6 --> 4929.2390000000005
whether it's possible and that is the

4925.36 --> 4929.239
way that i just described

4932.239 --> 4936.159
no i'm not gonna do it i don't have

4934.32 --> 4938.4
money for that [ __ ]

4936.159 --> 4939.599999999999
yeah you know what i need my money for

4938.4 --> 4941.599999999999
jarvis

4939.6 --> 4944.4800000000005
for food

4941.6 --> 4946.2390000000005
and for basic smoking

4944.48 --> 4948.718999999999
yeah i don't have

4946.239 --> 4951.44
money to waste on that [ __ ] i'm not an

4948.719 --> 4954.2390000000005
electric expert i'm not an electronic

4951.44 --> 4957.04
expert i'm not an engineer

4954.239 --> 4959.5199999999995
all that stuff is not for me

4957.04 --> 4960.48
i'm a theorist

4959.52 --> 4963.280000000001
yeah

4960.48 --> 4966.718999999999
now give me an engineer and i'll make it

4963.28 --> 4968.719
happen right same goes for my light

4966.719 --> 4971.44
experiments to figure out the true

4968.719 --> 4973.679
nature of light yeah i don't know

4971.44 --> 4976.159
anything about engineering in that sense

4973.679 --> 4978.0
i don't know anything about lasers and

4976.159 --> 4980.719
the machine and how that works and what

4978.0 --> 4983.36
you're going to look out for etc etc i'm

4980.719 --> 4984.96
not an engineer but i damn well can

4983.36 --> 4986.48
figure it out

4984.96 --> 4989.28
in my mind

4986.48 --> 4991.28
that's why i've done that with john john

4989.28 --> 4993.44
refracted curvature

4991.28 --> 4995.28
and he's been very interested in my

4993.44 --> 4999.28
light experiment and he's actually

4995.28 --> 5001.84
talked about it with other engineers now

4999.28 --> 5005.5199999999995
and some of which it really apparently

5001.84 --> 5006.8
got like totally mind-blown because of

5005.52 --> 5009.120000000001
it yeah

5006.8 --> 5012.0
at first hearing it

5009.12 --> 5014.32
he laid it out how to do it to somebody

5012.0 --> 5015.44
else and their mind was immediately

5014.32 --> 5017.44
blown

5015.44 --> 5019.919999999999
like so much blown that he just started

5017.44 --> 5021.199
rambling for two minutes traits

5019.92 --> 5024.639
about

5021.199 --> 5027.199
the consequences etc yeah

5024.639 --> 5030.159000000001
i'm a theorist i'm not an engineer i'm

5027.199 --> 5033.36
not joke just do it yourself just get

5030.159 --> 5036.5599999999995
the machine just oh just a few thousand

5033.36 --> 5037.679
bucks just to test something yeah sure

5036.56 --> 5038.639
right

5037.679 --> 5041.52
no

5038.639 --> 5043.6
i don't do that you wanna help me out

5041.52 --> 5044.4800000000005
you're an engineer you could make it

5043.6 --> 5046.96
happen

5044.48 --> 5049.44
i'd love to do it with you

5046.96 --> 5050.56
i'm not going to do it on my own that's

5049.44 --> 5054.0
never

5050.56 --> 5056.4800000000005
ever going to happen you understand ever

5054.0 --> 5058.239
it's pointless suggesting it to me i

5056.48 --> 5061.04
don't have the money i don't have the

5058.239 --> 5064.759999999999
expertise i don't have the room

5061.04 --> 5064.76
for any of that

5087.76 --> 5091.4400000000005
okay

5088.96 --> 5091.44
all right

5092.0 --> 5096.4
you're looking at what what are you

5093.92 --> 5099.12
looking at the price of adam

5096.4 --> 5103.199
moonbones would never prove or nor proof

5099.12 --> 5103.199
globe nor flat earth or rotating yeah

5104.159 --> 5108.4
well it would prove that that the moon

5106.0 --> 5111.199
is physical steamy traveler and i think

5108.4 --> 5114.239
that is a very good thing to prove or

5111.199 --> 5116.5599999999995
disprove wouldn't you say

5114.239 --> 5120.08
yeah exactly it only would prove or

5116.56 --> 5123.4400000000005
disprove the holographic the holograph

5120.08 --> 5125.28
the holographic nature yeah

5123.44 --> 5127.12
i know

5125.28 --> 5129.199
right well if you want to disprove the

5127.12 --> 5133.36
holographic nature and claim that it's a

5129.199 --> 5136.239
giant ball of dirt floating around us

5133.36 --> 5137.92
like moonfall huh the movie moon fall if

5136.239 --> 5140.32
you want to prove it's like that

5137.92 --> 5141.679
well yeah then you gotta disprove its

5140.32 --> 5146.599999999999
holographic

5141.679 --> 5146.6
by having an actual radio bounce signal

5155.76 --> 5161.4800000000005
get the [ __ ] out of here you [ __ ]

5157.36 --> 5161.48
scumbag go kill yourself

5176.719 --> 5180.88
okay yeah price will eat

5178.56 --> 5180.88
sure

5181.44 --> 5185.48
i'm not gonna look at it

5198.4 --> 5201.199
no

5199.28 --> 5204.32
no that's completely unnecessary level

5201.199 --> 5206.4
bastard i mean the dude

5204.32 --> 5208.719
makes no sense the moon

5206.4 --> 5210.32
is gonna change its angle during the

5208.719 --> 5211.04
night

5210.32 --> 5214.08
so

5211.04 --> 5216.48
oh oh really you're gonna you can only

5214.08 --> 5218.5599999999995
do the signal readout at this very

5216.48 --> 5221.599999999999
specific minute

5218.56 --> 5224.639
when it might just be hanging behind the

5221.6 --> 5226.639
satellite that's total nonsense i mean

5224.639 --> 5229.76
you just wait an hour

5226.639 --> 5231.6
and then you point it like 14 degrees

5229.76 --> 5233.4400000000005
differently there's not going to be a

5231.6 --> 5234.96
set loon like

5233.44 --> 5239.48
no

5234.96 --> 5239.4800000000005
just no this is pointless

5241.679 --> 5245.1990000000005
you're an unlucky guy yeah but that's

5243.199 --> 5248.08
just ridiculous

5245.199 --> 5248.08
it's not gonna happen

5248.56 --> 5253.360000000001
i mean in my opinion the signal wouldn't

5250.56 --> 5254.8
even reach that far

5253.36 --> 5257.759999999999
it's just

5254.8 --> 5260.719
none of it actually makes sense

5257.76 --> 5263.04
none of it makes sense don't you get it

5260.719 --> 5265.12
the entire idea that you could even send

5263.04 --> 5268.12
a freaking signal to the moon over that

5265.12 --> 5271.12
presupposed distance and back is

5268.12 --> 5275.199
absolutely absurd

5271.12 --> 5278.0
yet it is claimed my asses with ham

5275.199 --> 5281.759999999999
radios who claim that they've done that

5278.0 --> 5283.12
liars scummy disgusting liars

5281.76 --> 5286.320000000001
that say that

5283.12 --> 5286.32
it's ridiculous

5287.76 --> 5292.719
really you're gonna send a signal

5289.76 --> 5294.639
through a ham radio typical ham radio

5292.719 --> 5296.96
over that distance

5294.639 --> 5299.52
really

5296.96 --> 5300.96
oh so

5299.52 --> 5303.1990000000005
like

5300.96 --> 5304.639
are you gonna like do it in some kind of

5303.199 --> 5306.239
a bunker

5304.639 --> 5308.08
silo

5306.239 --> 5310.48
because the amount of energy you would

5308.08 --> 5314.0
have to ram into that device might like

5310.48 --> 5315.759999999999
literally melt the entire radio

5314.0 --> 5318.8
that's how strong it would need to be to

5315.76 --> 5322.88
even go that distance everything about

5318.8 --> 5325.679
the entire scenario is absurd

5322.88 --> 5328.8
hey you want to prove it's possible

5325.679 --> 5331.679
and you do it the way i told you

5328.8 --> 5334.320000000001
yeah that's the only way to actually

5331.679 --> 5337.84
give a satisfactory demonstration so you

5334.32 --> 5337.84
go and do that then

5341.89 --> 5345.089
[Music]

5358.719 --> 5363.719
wider when it comes back right

5367.12 --> 5370.719
what do you think about the cold

5368.48 --> 5373.599999999999
moonlight thing i have my ideas about

5370.719 --> 5376.56
that i devised an experiment or a test

5373.6 --> 5378.719
not an experiment really not yet

5376.56 --> 5382.400000000001
to figure out what

5378.719 --> 5385.28
is causing the apparent cooling

5382.4 --> 5388.32
i've suspected that the moon light

5385.28 --> 5391.36
itself is not literally cold

5388.32 --> 5394.0
but that it might enhance entropy

5391.36 --> 5397.28
in other words that it might

5394.0 --> 5400.48
enhance the potential ability to cool

5397.28 --> 5403.599999999999
off or to transfer heat right that the

5400.48 --> 5405.839999999999
instead of it being cold energy which

5403.6 --> 5407.6
logically doesn't make any sense to me

5405.84 --> 5411.12
that moonlight is

5407.6 --> 5414.56
entropy enhancing and that it will

5411.12 --> 5417.12
enhance the exchange of heat

5414.56 --> 5420.6
and in the night that typically means

5417.12 --> 5420.599999999999
cooling off

5420.96 --> 5426.719
so there is a test to figure out how to

5423.92 --> 5430.96
do that call it the moonlight test

5426.719 --> 5430.96
i have an enclosed space

5431.28 --> 5436.159
with like

5432.84 --> 5439.4400000000005
uh transparent plastic top that would

5436.159 --> 5441.679
definitely let full moon light through

5439.44 --> 5443.5199999999995
you have a temperature control in that

5441.679 --> 5445.28
room it's like dirt

5443.52 --> 5447.040000000001
you have perfect temperature checking

5445.28 --> 5449.5199999999995
and control

5447.04 --> 5451.36
and then you just check

5449.52 --> 5454.4800000000005
if everything is the exact same

5451.36 --> 5456.5599999999995
temperature the soil and the air within

5454.48 --> 5459.12
that controlled room you unleash you

5456.56 --> 5460.8
open the top the moonlight comes through

5459.12 --> 5462.239
is the temperature going to change is it

5460.8 --> 5465.04
actually going to cool off or is it

5462.239 --> 5467.678999999999
going to stay the same

5465.04 --> 5469.76
yeah then you have another one

5467.679 --> 5471.92
instead of having a temperature control

5469.76 --> 5474.08
make it the same temperature you make

5471.92 --> 5476.4800000000005
the earth warmer and the air a little

5474.08 --> 5479.04
cooler which is typically the nighttime

5476.48 --> 5480.48
situation then you open the top again

5479.04 --> 5483.76
moonlight

5480.48 --> 5486.5599999999995
is the temperature gonna cool off faster

5483.76 --> 5489.6
of the earth then well there you go the

5486.56 --> 5492.88
moonlight is not cold energy instead it

5489.6 --> 5496.159000000001
is a entropy enhancer and it will

5492.88 --> 5498.88
aggravate heat exchange

5496.159 --> 5501.44
that would be my conclusion that's my

5498.88 --> 5503.6
little test that i devised like three

5501.44 --> 5505.919999999999
years ago yeah

5503.6 --> 5508.4800000000005
i mean i've been at this sort of thing a

5505.92 --> 5511.6
long time guys i am a theorist i've

5508.48 --> 5513.28
devised a whole bunch of very very good

5511.6 --> 5516.159000000001
theories here

5513.28 --> 5519.04
that are like on the edge of actual

5516.159 --> 5520.4
scientific discovery here especially my

5519.04 --> 5524.08
light test

5520.4 --> 5527.839999999999
and i've devised a whole bunch of them

5524.08 --> 5527.84
three at the top of my head

5529.84 --> 5534.2390000000005
so

5530.96 --> 5536.4800000000005
yeah moonlight you can actually figure

5534.239 --> 5539.919999999999
out what it is will it always introduce

5536.48 --> 5543.36
cold or is it simply an entropy enhancer

5539.92 --> 5545.679
that will aggravate heat exchange

5543.36 --> 5549.44
specifically it's one way to figure it

5545.679 --> 5549.4400000000005
out and that's my test

5550.4 --> 5554.5599999999995
like when you put solenoids it melts

5552.159 --> 5557.44
quicker right

5554.56 --> 5557.4400000000005
something like that

5558.08 --> 5562.0
the thing is

5559.52 --> 5563.4400000000005
if in a controlled environment where

5562.0 --> 5565.44
everything is exactly the same

5563.44 --> 5567.04
temperature and moonlight is introduced

5565.44 --> 5569.678999999999
will it cause

5567.04 --> 5572.32
it literally becoming colder

5569.679 --> 5574.56
or will it do nothing will it only cause

5572.32 --> 5576.159
colds when there is a temperature

5574.56 --> 5577.52
difference within the controlled

5576.159 --> 5580.08
environment

5577.52 --> 5584.320000000001
if it's like that then it will be an

5580.08 --> 5587.44
entropy effect instead of cold energy

5584.32 --> 5590.96
somehow which makes no logical sense

5587.44 --> 5592.879999999999
right but if moonlight causes entropy

5590.96 --> 5595.36
then it's different

5592.88 --> 5597.6
then it's a kind of a new mystery

5595.36 --> 5599.36
but makes more sense than cold energy

5597.6 --> 5602.639
which makes absolutely no sense like

5599.36 --> 5605.36
there's that cannot compute cold energy

5602.639 --> 5607.679
cannot compute at all

5605.36 --> 5610.08
so there's no logical framework to back

5607.679 --> 5612.4
such in a statement up doesn't make any

5610.08 --> 5612.4
sense

5612.96 --> 5620.52
but if it's an entropy and enhancing

5615.36 --> 5620.5199999999995
effect well that might make some sense

5633.28 --> 5639.92
ah it's been a great show so far

5636.719 --> 5639.92
very technical today

5642.239 --> 5647.04
should buy myself a fan

5644.8 --> 5649.52
well i do have one but yeah i'll need

5647.04 --> 5651.44
some support

5649.52 --> 5652.639
could always use it but i have a bit of

5651.44 --> 5654.96
a fan it's

5652.639 --> 5659.8
if i'm without my t-shirt here it's it's

5654.96 --> 5659.8
doable it's pretty doable together

5661.43 --> 5665.169
[Music]

5669.31 --> 5673.84
[Music]

5671.199 --> 5677.5199999999995
check my paypal love it drunken bullet

5673.84 --> 5677.52
you're the best bullet ever

5685.199 --> 5689.199
and of course thank you adam price

5686.8 --> 5689.1990000000005
earlier

5694.159 --> 5698.0
dude

5695.199 --> 5700.638999999999
drunken bull dude you are

5698.0 --> 5703.36
you're pretty wealthy i think sometimes

5700.639 --> 5705.76
thank you so much

5703.36 --> 5705.759999999999
this is

5705.84 --> 5709.4400000000005
that's great

5708.48 --> 5712.08
wow

5709.44 --> 5715.599999999999
to think about that

5712.08 --> 5718.639
yeah that's gonna probably last me to

5715.6 --> 5721.119000000001
halfway next week maybe maybe i'm a bit

5718.639 --> 5723.6
too optimistic there

5721.119 --> 5726.239
something like that

5723.6 --> 5729.280000000001
yeah that's great

5726.239 --> 5733.678999999999
thank you so much drunken bullet and

5729.28 --> 5733.679
adam price earlier this is awesome

5736.56 --> 5741.1990000000005
sometimes i like to help where i can

5738.08 --> 5743.6
well you are certainly doing that

5741.199 --> 5744.48
thank you so much

5743.6 --> 5748.96
great

5744.48 --> 5748.959999999999
and yeah great fun having you around too

5751.04 --> 5756.0
you're gonna have to buy a proper fan

5753.119 --> 5759.599999999999
nah sorry i'm not gonna do that actually

5756.0 --> 5759.6
i still need it for just food

5763.76 --> 5768.96
thermodynamics says cool light isn't

5765.679 --> 5772.0
possible yeah i know akumavirus that's

5768.96 --> 5774.4
why i devised the test to figure out if

5772.0 --> 5776.719
the cooling is actually caused by

5774.4 --> 5779.5199999999995
something else

5776.719 --> 5782.96
yeah that the cooling is just apparent

5779.52 --> 5784.56
because of heat exchange

5782.96 --> 5787.119
that's the point food more important

5784.56 --> 5791.4400000000005
yeah i know

5787.119 --> 5791.44
i know that's why i'm very thankful

5795.28 --> 5799.04
all right

5796.719 --> 5802.0
yeah it makes sense like you said

5799.04 --> 5804.32
because indeed thermodynamics

5802.0 --> 5806.56
doesn't allow light to be cool because

5804.32 --> 5808.719
cool energy makes no sense that's like

5806.56 --> 5810.320000000001
an anti-energy energy

5808.719 --> 5812.8
makes no sense

5810.32 --> 5816.239
so if the cooling

5812.8 --> 5819.76
is simply a happenstance thing because

5816.239 --> 5821.839999999999
typically at night the ground is warmer

5819.76 --> 5823.1990000000005
the air is cooler so there is a

5821.84 --> 5824.4800000000005
temperature difference when there's a

5823.199 --> 5827.119
temperature difference there's going to

5824.48 --> 5830.0
be temperature exchange well

5827.119 --> 5833.36
temperature exchange actually causes

5830.0 --> 5834.719
apparent cold to read out really it does

5833.36 --> 5838.159
so

5834.719 --> 5840.4
if there is a temperature difference

5838.159 --> 5843.119
and the moon light comes in

5840.4 --> 5846.159
and the entropy effectively would cause

5843.119 --> 5848.5599999999995
the heat exchange to aggravate then that

5846.159 --> 5853.44
might just exactly read out like hey

5848.56 --> 5855.679
it's cold the moon light is cooling it

5853.44 --> 5858.159
well that wouldn't be because the energy

5855.679 --> 5861.28
itself is cold but because the heat

5858.159 --> 5863.199
exchange would increase

5861.28 --> 5865.119
so more heat would come out of the

5863.199 --> 5865.919999999999
ground quicker where the moonlight hits

5865.119 --> 5868.159
it

5865.92 --> 5869.4400000000005
and it would seem colder than the ground

5868.159 --> 5873.48
surrounding it

5869.44 --> 5873.48
that was the point of the test

5885.04 --> 5890.08
would have to know what the wound is no

5887.44 --> 5890.08
no you don't

5890.48 --> 5895.759999999999
but you do have because you can't really

5893.04 --> 5898.4
know but we can't measure the light

5895.76 --> 5900.719
effect just like with the sun

5898.4 --> 5903.5199999999995
we don't know exactly what the sun is

5900.719 --> 5906.56
it's a hologram it's just an image of

5903.52 --> 5909.56
light as far as we can actually figure

5906.56 --> 5909.56
out

5910.88 --> 5915.1990000000005
to even say it emits energy is almost a

5913.6 --> 5917.92
straw man

5915.199 --> 5920.719
because it is not a thing it's an

5917.92 --> 5923.1990000000005
apparition i mean the energy is there

5920.719 --> 5924.56
it's arriving but to say it is coming

5923.199 --> 5926.799999999999
from that

5924.56 --> 5929.1990000000005
that is like a physicality assumption

5926.8 --> 5931.679
bias based statement

5929.199 --> 5934.0
it's like claiming it's a lamp

5931.679 --> 5936.32
a physical man-made lamp that is sending

5934.0 --> 5938.96
light or it isn't it's a hologram it

5936.32 --> 5942.0
isn't actually coming from anywhere it's

5938.96 --> 5943.44
just manifesting non-local holograms the

5942.0 --> 5945.199
celestials

5943.44 --> 5948.799999999999
that's my model

5945.199 --> 5950.159
have not seen any proof that contradicts

5948.8 --> 5953.84
that model

5950.159 --> 5953.839999999999
just yet anyway

5969.04 --> 5972.96
thinking away from the glow

5975.679 --> 5979.119
your son's brain broke

5979.76 --> 5984.2390000000005
okay

5981.84 --> 5984.2390000000005
did it

5984.4 --> 5986.799999999999
sorry

5986.88 --> 5991.28
what do you think beyond the ice

5988.96 --> 5994.28
dude did somebody ask that yesterday i

5991.28 --> 5994.28
mean

5994.8 --> 5998.4800000000005
i don't even know there is an ice wall

5999.36 --> 6003.36
why would you say it's a wall maybe it's

6001.44 --> 6005.28
just a big chunk of ice why would that

6003.36 --> 6008.239
be a wall

6005.28 --> 6010.08
how do you know it is a continual wall i

6008.239 --> 6012.718999999999
mean oh yeah there was footage there was

6010.08 --> 6014.4
footage guys from what

6012.719 --> 6016.96
80 years ago

6014.4 --> 6019.679
yeah there was footage from 80 years ago

6016.96 --> 6023.44
oh no that means that it has to still be

6019.679 --> 6024.4
there exactly like in the footage right

6023.44 --> 6028.08
no

6024.4 --> 6030.159
no that doesn't have to mean that at all

6028.08 --> 6032.5599999999995
you don't know you don't even know where

6030.159 --> 6035.199
it was exactly shot you know where it

6032.56 --> 6038.96
was claimed to have been shot

6035.199 --> 6038.96
how do you know it was actually there

6039.199 --> 6044.719
in the claim location

6042.0 --> 6046.8
you don't know any of that

6044.719 --> 6048.88
when's the last time somebody even saw

6046.8 --> 6052.88
that supposed eyes wall

6048.88 --> 6052.88
with their own eyes and filmed it

6059.119 --> 6064.239
the sun gives entry no

6061.92 --> 6066.639
sun gives energy

6064.239 --> 6068.159
entropy is not something that is given

6066.639 --> 6070.2390000000005
or taken away

6068.159 --> 6072.799999999999
entropy is an effect

6070.239 --> 6074.5599999999995
it is something that always happens

6072.8 --> 6077.04
it's the law of nature

6074.56 --> 6079.6
sun doesn't give entropy and knight

6077.04 --> 6083.679
doesn't take it away sun gives energy

6079.6 --> 6086.2390000000005
and the night then depletes that energy

6083.679 --> 6089.28
and potentially the moon could be

6086.239 --> 6090.08
enhancing the entropy of that entropy is

6089.28 --> 6092.48
not

6090.08 --> 6096.29
a thing to be given or taken it's

6092.48 --> 6101.83
something that just happens at all times

6096.29 --> 6101.83
[Music]

6106.4 --> 6109.44
yeah

6107.28 --> 6110.32
you happy you seen it by the way

6109.44 --> 6112.239
dude

6110.32 --> 6114.48
that's like in the first part of the

6112.239 --> 6118.4
moon fall they literally addressed that

6114.48 --> 6120.08
by the way how ridiculous you know

6118.4 --> 6122.239
that part i thought was pretty amazing

6120.08 --> 6124.719
because it was a real good switcheroo a

6122.239 --> 6126.0
bit of spoiler here bit of spoiler but

6124.719 --> 6128.159
it's worth it

6126.0 --> 6131.04
it's not going to reveal the rest

6128.159 --> 6133.599999999999
but they basically are come up like yeah

6131.04 --> 6136.88
the moon is 400 times smaller than the

6133.6 --> 6138.719
sun and exactly 400 times the distance

6136.88 --> 6141.6
why can't that be that seems

6138.719 --> 6143.84
astronomically impossible

6141.6 --> 6145.84
like that's mathematically impossible

6143.84 --> 6148.88
they literally say that the guy that

6145.84 --> 6152.0
presents that and then he says but if

6148.88 --> 6155.119
it's a station

6152.0 --> 6157.199
then it could be kept exactly in that

6155.119 --> 6159.599999999999
location

6157.199 --> 6159.599999999999
why

6159.92 --> 6163.84
don't say why but to just say yeah

6162.08 --> 6166.159
that's the reason why the moon is

6163.84 --> 6168.719
perfectly facing us exactly like that

6166.159 --> 6170.638999999999
and always that exact distance because

6168.719 --> 6174.32
it's actually a space station that's

6170.639 --> 6176.11
specifically programmed to do that

6174.32 --> 6179.25
okay

6176.11 --> 6179.25
[Music]

6179.44 --> 6183.919999999999
that's in that movie moonfall

6181.92 --> 6186.159
it's in there it that part was really

6183.92 --> 6188.32
hilarious

6186.159 --> 6191.32
it's really in your face hilarious right

6188.32 --> 6191.32
so

6193.28 --> 6195.599999999999
what

6202.96 --> 6207.36
okay

6205.36 --> 6210.159
moonlight

6207.36 --> 6212.32
okay that's hilarious left diode can be

6210.159 --> 6213.839999999999
used as solar panels

6212.32 --> 6216.159
what

6213.84 --> 6216.159000000001
okay

6216.719 --> 6221.6
well i don't necessarily want to watch a

6219.04 --> 6225.04
youtube video an article might be more

6221.6 --> 6225.04
effective for that someone

6225.199 --> 6231.799999999999
i mean if that's like officially being

6227.76 --> 6231.8
utilized now that's interesting

6232.32 --> 6235.36
min that's a long time

6236.719 --> 6241.119
all right by the way have you picked up

6238.32 --> 6244.239
on this weird thing this item on the

6241.119 --> 6246.4
infowars from two days ago someone

6244.239 --> 6249.119
it basically said like oh yeah there's

6246.4 --> 6251.36
cold fusion now it's not actually fusion

6249.119 --> 6254.4
but that's what it's called

6251.36 --> 6255.119
they just call it that popularly

6254.4 --> 6256.4
but

6255.119 --> 6259.119
yeah basically

6256.4 --> 6260.48
a material that is like radon except not

6259.119 --> 6262.96
radioactive

6260.48 --> 6264.959999999999
that can be used as like perfectly safe

6262.96 --> 6267.84
undepletable

6264.96 --> 6270.8
micro nuclear reactors like non-nuclear

6267.84 --> 6270.8
nuclear reactors

6272.0 --> 6276.239
did you see that i have i haven't heard

6274.4 --> 6278.0
anything about it back i didn't even see

6276.239 --> 6280.638999999999
a freaking article about it it's really

6278.0 --> 6284.4
confusing like how why did that just

6280.639 --> 6286.96
come out was that just complete or [ __ ]

6284.4 --> 6289.759999999999
or is that actually a thing

6286.96 --> 6291.92
it was so weird

6289.76 --> 6293.76
like in your face like oh yeah we we're

6291.92 --> 6295.6
gonna get like fusion

6293.76 --> 6297.360000000001
reactors now

6295.6 --> 6298.159000000001
what

6297.36 --> 6300.32
what

6298.159 --> 6302.159
what oh that's gonna be a thing now it's

6300.32 --> 6305.04
gonna be mega industrialized it's going

6302.159 --> 6307.839999999999
to revolutionize all the electric

6305.04 --> 6309.6
and fuel industries and like we no

6307.84 --> 6311.6
longer even need nuclear power now

6309.6 --> 6313.280000000001
thanks to those things and you can

6311.6 --> 6314.96
completely decentralize it basically

6313.28 --> 6316.5599999999995
have a device like that in every home

6314.96 --> 6318.0
and it's perfectly safe

6316.56 --> 6320.159000000001
what

6318.0 --> 6321.04
what

6320.159 --> 6323.199
so

6321.04 --> 6325.76
how is that gonna work is they actually

6323.199 --> 6325.759999999999
gonna happen

6328.639 --> 6333.64
it just kind of overran me

6331.76 --> 6336.6990000000005
when i watched that

6333.64 --> 6336.6990000000005
[Music]

6337.679 --> 6341.4800000000005
anyway that was on thursday

6350.88 --> 6355.92
let's see if mike adams still had

6352.719 --> 6357.04
because he did that part he did that

6355.92 --> 6359.76
show

6357.04 --> 6362.32
about that subject

6359.76 --> 6364.159000000001
i can't find any feedback about it and

6362.32 --> 6366.88
that's kind of weird it's weirding me

6364.159 --> 6369.199
out like why isn't if this is really

6366.88 --> 6371.4400000000005
going to be like a new industrial

6369.199 --> 6374.638999999999
revolution like thing

6371.44 --> 6376.719
why isn't like everything booming with

6374.639 --> 6378.96
talks about it

6376.719 --> 6381.44
like oh damn it like the investment just

6378.96 --> 6384.159
got overkill and we've like surpassed

6381.44 --> 6386.879999999999
like 400 percent of our budget and

6384.159 --> 6389.04
or like 400 percent of the needed income

6386.88 --> 6393.6
and like

6389.04 --> 6393.6
ups like no nothing there's no feedback

6394.719 --> 6399.92
but it was an item on the show

6398.08 --> 6402.88
they made a whole bunch of claims how it

6399.92 --> 6404.2390000000005
is like really solid and reliable and

6402.88 --> 6405.6
revolutionary it's gonna change

6404.239 --> 6408.32
everything and now

6405.6 --> 6412.04
it's just gone i'm not hearing anything

6408.32 --> 6412.04
this is so odd

6416.0 --> 6420.28
did anybody else see that

6451.92 --> 6456.32
not sure it will happen

6453.92 --> 6459.52
well the thing is it's it's like being

6456.32 --> 6461.36
sold or something like you can just

6459.52 --> 6463.280000000001
order it for yourself

6461.36 --> 6466.239
i'm just surprised that it's not like

6463.28 --> 6470.5599999999995
booming all over the place i mean

6466.239 --> 6473.199
i cannot think of a more effective

6470.56 --> 6476.080000000001
thing to have during this stupid energy

6473.199 --> 6476.08
crisis wouldn't you

6476.48 --> 6480.879999999999
i mean it's permanent

6478.32 --> 6483.119
it's just a permanent energy like

6480.88 --> 6485.679
passive you literally don't even have to

6483.119 --> 6487.679
insert any fuel or anything it's just

6485.679 --> 6490.4
passive permanent

6487.679 --> 6490.4
like what the hell

6497.199 --> 6500.32
powered car yeah yeah

6503.36 --> 6508.88
yeah we all heard about that but that's

6505.28 --> 6512.639
that was like a long time ago

6508.88 --> 6514.159000000001
the landscape has changed so why isn't

6512.639 --> 6516.4800000000005
it being

6514.159 --> 6518.48
everywhere why isn't it getting in your

6516.48 --> 6519.759999999999
face this is like the new investment

6518.48 --> 6522.959999999999
opportunity

6519.76 --> 6526.280000000001
big business right happening

6522.96 --> 6526.28
right now

6530.0 --> 6534.639
and runs on water man yeah i know price

6532.159 --> 6534.638999999999
of atom

6537.84 --> 6543.76
now [ __ ] watercolor powered car is

6540.639 --> 6543.76
very much possible

6546.88 --> 6551.56
there's a whole bunch of things possible

6558.32 --> 6565.04
how does it work i don't know i'm not a

6560.96 --> 6567.04
mechanic i just know it's possible

6565.04 --> 6569.04
just like i know it is possible to

6567.04 --> 6571.599
literally have your

6569.04 --> 6573.679
water car run on water

6571.599 --> 6577.04
by in like

6573.679 --> 6578.4800000000005
right there on the spot converted into

6577.04 --> 6580.8
into hydrogen

6578.48 --> 6583.119
like right next to the motor and then

6580.8 --> 6585.679
have that hydrogen inserted in the motor

6583.119 --> 6587.36
so basically run your car on hydrogen

6585.679 --> 6589.52
that you make

6587.36 --> 6594.08
in your car

6589.52 --> 6594.080000000001
so you can literally tank up on water

6594.639 --> 6599.52
you just literally put a hose of water

6596.96 --> 6599.52
in the tank

6601.599 --> 6604.719
and i've seen that done

6603.76 --> 6607.679
like

6604.719 --> 6607.679
actually seen it

6608.639 --> 6613.679
i was a whole while back if i

6611.84 --> 6616.159000000001
wish i still had the money but i

6613.679 --> 6618.4800000000005
actually had the opportunity to have my

6616.159 --> 6620.239
car converted to that

6618.48 --> 6622.799999999999
i'm really

6620.239 --> 6624.959999999999
annoyed and disappointed that i didn't

6622.8 --> 6626.4800000000005
get to that because i i kind of really

6624.96 --> 6629.76
wanted that

6626.48 --> 6633.28
i mean freaking free gas just water i

6629.76 --> 6638.89
mean that is super epic

6633.28 --> 6645.139999999999
but i i didn't do it ugh so stupid of me

6638.89 --> 6645.14
[Music]

6656.4 --> 6660.799999999999
split hydrogen water from using much

6658.96 --> 6662.4
less energy

6660.8 --> 6665.4400000000005
yeah

6662.4 --> 6667.04
hydrolyzes you in electrolysis

6665.44 --> 6669.04
yeah but there is

6667.04 --> 6671.679
i i don't know who this stanley spg has

6669.04 --> 6674.32
seen it but i knew a guy that literally

6671.679 --> 6676.76
was a personal friend of somebody that

6674.32 --> 6679.5199999999995
created a patented

6676.76 --> 6680.719
electrolysis machine

6679.52 --> 6684.4800000000005
yeah

6680.719 --> 6684.4800000000005
that was what was it again

6684.92 --> 6691.119
500 times cheaper

6687.679 --> 6693.599
to build than the previous system which

6691.119 --> 6695.5199999999995
uses like platinum plates and all that

6693.599 --> 6698.639
and like it had to

6695.52 --> 6701.280000000001
for it to work well he devised a system

6698.639 --> 6701.28
to do that

6701.76 --> 6704.88
to

6702.56 --> 6707.280000000001
then a dutch guy by the way he devised

6704.88 --> 6709.679
the system to have electrolysis happened

6707.28 --> 6711.199
like without even needing

6709.679 --> 6713.679
noble metals

6711.199 --> 6715.839999999999
it was amazing it was super efficient

6713.679 --> 6718.159
and it's like you can run it on a 9-volt

6715.84 --> 6722.1990000000005
battery

6718.159 --> 6722.199
he patented that [ __ ]

6724.239 --> 6728.638999999999
i don't know if was able to ever sell it

6726.96 --> 6730.08
after that point because yeah when you

6728.639 --> 6733.1990000000005
paid it

6730.08 --> 6735.119
you know how that [ __ ] happens always

6733.199 --> 6736.4
but

6735.119 --> 6739.5199999999995
i really

6736.4 --> 6741.679
like that system should be out there

6739.52 --> 6744.0
for sale

6741.679 --> 6746.56
like oh you need a

6744.0 --> 6747.76
electrolysis hydrogen

6746.56 --> 6748.96
generator

6747.76 --> 6752.4800000000005
well

6748.96 --> 6755.28
those machines should be for sale

6752.48 --> 6757.119
and instead of costing like

6755.28 --> 6760.159
what is it

6757.119 --> 6762.48
10 or 20 000 euros they cost like a

6760.159 --> 6765.839999999999
thousand

6762.48 --> 6765.839999999999
or 500 or something

12 years ago

6780.32 --> 6785.04
when i was really into all that energy

6782.719 --> 6785.04
stuff

6785.76 --> 6789.119000000001
so i don't know if that guy is even

6787.28 --> 6793.84
still alive

6789.119 --> 6793.839999999999
i hope he is he was freaking genius

6798.99 --> 6806.4
[Music]

6802.88 --> 6808.83
ooh nice wins

6806.4 --> 6812.08
yes

6808.83 --> 6812.08
[Music]

6819.199 --> 6824.32
and stuff signal mail yeah yeah

6823.04 --> 6826.88
firefly

6824.32 --> 6826.88
the movie

6827.52 --> 6831.64
that's right

6828.45 --> 6831.639999999999
[Music]

6831.679 --> 6834.719
that was the important stuff that gets

6833.04 --> 6836.56
deleted from youtube yeah that's why

6834.719 --> 6838.639
when it's really important you need to

6836.56 --> 6840.96
download it you just need to download

6838.639 --> 6843.119
the video

6840.96 --> 6845.04
to have it on your computer and then

6843.119 --> 6848.799999999999
share it on forums

6845.04 --> 6852.08
like just the video file or serenity

6848.8 --> 6854.88
yeah serenity it was called

6852.08 --> 6857.199
just like the ship

6854.88 --> 6860.400000000001
firefly was the class of the ship

6857.199 --> 6863.4
serenity was the name of the ship

6860.4 --> 6863.4
anyway

6873.119 --> 6876.5199999999995
time has flown

6889.28 --> 6894.96
right with energy yeah energy stuff

6891.84 --> 6897.4400000000005
energy developments it's out there

6894.96 --> 6899.84
but you should never expect that it's

6897.44 --> 6901.199
going to be industrialized

6899.84 --> 6905.1990000000005
like

6901.199 --> 6907.759999999999
if it cannot be utilized to parasite on

6905.199 --> 6910.159
the general public it's not going to be

6907.76 --> 6911.52
industrialized

6910.159 --> 6914.4
sometimes i even think that

6911.52 --> 6917.76
industrialization itself

6914.4 --> 6921.598999999999
was specifically enrolled

6917.76 --> 6923.4400000000005
to prevent the people from naturally

6921.599 --> 6924.88
overcoming their issues by their own

6923.44 --> 6927.36
inventions

6924.88 --> 6929.36
i mean industrialization came out of the

6927.36 --> 6931.36
renaissance which came out of medieval

6929.36 --> 6932.639
times medieval times was the times of

6931.36 --> 6936.239
guilt

6932.639 --> 6939.119
in medieval times i bet that like most

6936.239 --> 6941.04
important technologies were probably

6939.119 --> 6942.239
invented

6941.04 --> 6943.92
how

6942.239 --> 6947.04
through

6943.92 --> 6949.76
through the craft through the craft

6947.04 --> 6951.36
which in that time was developed by

6949.76 --> 6953.599
individuals

6951.36 --> 6955.839999999999
and their students

6953.599 --> 6958.4800000000005
just by doing it all the time and they

6955.84 --> 6960.88
formed guilds and they had power and

6958.48 --> 6962.959999999999
money because of their craft because

6960.88 --> 6965.119
they were so good at it

6962.96 --> 6968.0
and they had to keep it a secret right

6965.119 --> 6969.839999999999
industrial secrets were big that's why

6968.0 --> 6971.679
the guilds were there

6969.84 --> 6974.08
guild secrets

6971.679 --> 6975.92
secret technology information that was

6974.08 --> 6977.5199999999995
discovered it's not a public thing oh

6975.92 --> 6980.88
this was it all the time no it was

6977.52 --> 6983.1990000000005
secret secret nobody knew

6980.88 --> 6985.4400000000005
because it was kept secret

6983.199 --> 6987.759999999999
it was their secret if it leaked then

6985.44 --> 6990.32
they didn't have anything anymore

6987.76 --> 6991.92
they discovered something or god forbid

6990.32 --> 6993.759999999999
they stole it from somebody else and

6991.92 --> 6995.28
then murdered him

6993.76 --> 6996.400000000001
and then they would have that guild

6995.28 --> 6997.759999999999
secret

6996.4 --> 7001.36
right well i think that

6997.76 --> 7003.360000000001
industrialization was specifically to

7001.36 --> 7006.719
roll over

7003.36 --> 7009.04
all those old craft secrets and

7006.719 --> 7010.4
basically route them out to destroy the

7009.04 --> 7011.119
tradition

7010.4 --> 7012.879999999999
of

7011.119 --> 7014.48
student

7012.88 --> 7018.639
master

7014.48 --> 7020.959999999999
and replace it with like decentralized

7018.639 --> 7022.639
specialism

7020.96 --> 7024.96
that's what the industrialization was

7022.639 --> 7027.04
for to destroy the old knowledge that

7024.96 --> 7030.2390000000005
came out of the crafting

7027.04 --> 7031.44
age of medieval times

7030.239 --> 7033.759999999999
because they were just getting too

7031.44 --> 7035.5199999999995
powerful and they don't want that the

7033.76 --> 7037.52
rubber barons were going to take over

7035.52 --> 7040.56
and but to do that they first needed to

7037.52 --> 7042.400000000001
destroy all the power traditions

7040.56 --> 7044.56
all the traditions of personally

7042.4 --> 7048.0
developed power and knowledge

7044.56 --> 7048.0
through the craft age

7048.88 --> 7051.92
i had to destroy it

7052.88 --> 7059.92
the only way to destroy it is to

7056.0 --> 7062.88
steamroll it with something else that

7059.92 --> 7064.34
claims to be that

7062.88 --> 7068.999
that's how they do it

7064.34 --> 7068.999
[Music]

7069.44 --> 7073.48
what are you talking about

7071.04 --> 7073.48
and illegitimate

7088.8 --> 7093.1990000000005
oh you're talking about firefly yeah

7090.88 --> 7095.4400000000005
well they're not really space pirates

7093.199 --> 7099.879999999999
they're privateers

7095.44 --> 7099.879999999999
they don't literally rob people

7102.239 --> 7106.4
that's kind of a big point in the whole

7104.4 --> 7107.759999999999
firefly series is that they're not

7106.4 --> 7109.04
actually

7107.76 --> 7112.159000000001
thugs

7109.04 --> 7114.48
and highwaymen in space

7112.159 --> 7116.48
but they might like loot

7114.48 --> 7119.919999999999
dead ships or something

7116.48 --> 7123.919999999999
they are smugglers and opportunists

7119.92 --> 7123.92
so not literally a pirate

7124.32 --> 7130.639
but it is yeah it is effectively a

7126.48 --> 7132.799999999999
privateer but not a criminal privateer

7130.639 --> 7133.92
while they are technically criminal it's

7132.8 --> 7135.92
just that

7133.92 --> 7138.96
smuggling it's just about a smuggling

7135.92 --> 7140.56
group really that's what they did

7138.96 --> 7144.4
it was hilarious by the way that they

7140.56 --> 7148.04
also smuggled cows one time

7144.4 --> 7148.04
that was pretty amazing

7173.76 --> 7177.599
he didn't know how much detail to go

7175.52 --> 7179.52
into in a one season yeah but it doesn't

7177.599 --> 7182.32
matter like it's a one season show but

7179.52 --> 7185.599
it is effectively like two seasons

7182.32 --> 7186.48
it was so compact so much in there

7185.599 --> 7188.8
and

7186.48 --> 7192.159
so much more potential to go on from

7188.8 --> 7192.159000000001
there on it's just

7192.4 --> 7195.4
yeah

7195.82 --> 7199.0
[Music]

7201.36 --> 7207.28
seen the airship movie from airships

7204.159 --> 7207.28
from movie stardust

7208.239 --> 7211.879999999999
i might have

7226.239 --> 7229.4
all right

7240.4 --> 7243.04
i think i'm gonna round out the show

7241.92 --> 7246.08
guys

7243.04 --> 7246.08
it's been two hours

7247.28 --> 7251.32
i feel a little depleted

7254.239 --> 7258.799999999999
pirate ships with hot air balloons

7255.76 --> 7258.8
attached on the top

7266.84 --> 7271.599
interesting i might have to check it out

7269.119 --> 7271.598999999999
leg

7275.119 --> 7282.549999999999
oh my god stupid freaking

7279.41 --> 7282.55
[Music]

7283.0 --> 7286.88
2007 movie is that it

7290.8 --> 7295.320000000001
oh god it has him in it

7297.52 --> 7303.4400000000005
i think i remember why i didn't watch

7300.0 --> 7303.44
this movie is because

7304.08 --> 7308.76
the actors in it kind of really suck

7322.08 --> 7328.239
i think i don't like that movie

7324.639 --> 7328.2390000000005
i might have watched a little of it

7329.679 --> 7335.159
i mean who's that name that guy again

7339.679 --> 7344.8
ah robert de niro it's just like gross

7344.88 --> 7349.0
i can't stand that guy

7352.96 --> 7359.44
watch tennis yeah yeah i've already seen

7355.199 --> 7359.44
that gold moon logic yeah tanit is

7359.599 --> 7365.360000000001
really heavy on the sci-fi i like it i

7362.639 --> 7367.679
like that it i watched it like twice

7365.36 --> 7370.08
it is very interesting

7367.679 --> 7372.08
it's just an experience and it's like

7370.08 --> 7374.08
really i get a real kick out of it

7372.08 --> 7375.679
especially when he the main character

7374.08 --> 7378.639
first starts to figure out like what the

7375.679 --> 7381.36
[ __ ] is going on here that's so trippy

7378.639 --> 7383.599
yeah tenet is very impressive

7381.36 --> 7384.88
and it's so it's such a simple concept

7383.599 --> 7387.04
movie really

7384.88 --> 7389.119
very hard to puzzle it out but they did

7387.04 --> 7389.119
it

7389.679 --> 7392.84
amazing

7391.44 --> 7395.759999999999
the nero is

7392.84 --> 7399.32
funny sorry i've never seen him actually

7395.76 --> 7399.320000000001
funny in anything

7409.44 --> 7415.44
basically a remake of forest gump the

7412.08 --> 7415.44
indian forest gump

7416.48 --> 7421.919999999999
you couldn't get past 30 minutes wow was

7419.199 --> 7421.919999999999
it that bad

7427.44 --> 7432.759999999999
okay terry i'm gonna have to take your

7429.28 --> 7432.759999999999
word on it

7447.04 --> 7452.32
right anyway look i'm gonna run out the

7449.599 --> 7454.4800000000005
show but if any of you if you haven't

7452.32 --> 7455.759999999999
like watched

7454.48 --> 7458.32
moonfall

7455.76 --> 7460.320000000001
i still recommend it

7458.32 --> 7462.4
i mean it's a kind of a stupid movie in

7460.32 --> 7466.0
ways but there is some really

7462.4 --> 7467.92
interesting things in there

7466.0 --> 7470.4
and i mean yeah there's interesting

7467.92 --> 7472.0
jokes but especially the cgi was just

7470.4 --> 7474.799999999999
very impressive

7472.0 --> 7476.079
very very impressed by that

7474.8 --> 7478.56
scary

7476.079 --> 7480.639
heavy heavy sci-fis

7478.56 --> 7482.719
and by the way it didn't really make a

7480.639 --> 7484.32
lot of sense in retrospect i mean if the

7482.719 --> 7486.0
moon's gonna literally just start

7484.32 --> 7487.84
ripping everything apart you know what's

7486.0 --> 7490.4
gonna happen

7487.84 --> 7493.679
well after things restore

7490.4 --> 7495.759999999999
it's gonna be a giant dust bowl

7493.679 --> 7498.0
everywhere in the world

7495.76 --> 7499.1990000000005
i mean literally dust

7498.0 --> 7501.04
sand

7499.199 --> 7503.5199999999995
rocks were

7501.04 --> 7506.159
pulled from the earth and then crashed

7503.52 --> 7509.679
back down this means smoke and dust

7506.159 --> 7512.079
everywhere probably for years

7509.679 --> 7514.56
movie didn't really figure that one out

7512.079 --> 7517.04
but yeah it pretty much as soon as that

7514.56 --> 7519.92
[ __ ] starts rolling out and happening

7517.04 --> 7521.44
you know the world is just done it's

7519.92 --> 7524.32
everybody's gonna die now it doesn't

7521.44 --> 7526.879999999999
matter if they save the situation it's

7524.32 --> 7529.119
like everybody's just gonna die anyway

7526.88 --> 7531.04
this is

7529.119 --> 7533.44
but the movie doesn't tell you that

7531.04 --> 7535.679
right doesn't like oh no no everything's

7533.44 --> 7537.28
just back to normal after this right

7535.679 --> 7539.679
it's not like it's going to be a dust

7537.28 --> 7541.679
storm for a decade and

7539.679 --> 7544.0
everybody's going to die from hunger and

7541.679 --> 7546.8
all the animals are all dead and no more

7544.0 --> 7550.0
oxygen all the forest burn and

7546.8 --> 7550.96
no no no no everything will be just fine

7550.0 --> 7553.599
again

7550.96 --> 7556.159
sure it will be

7553.599 --> 7558.079
right but despite that it is just

7556.159 --> 7562.48
interesting

7558.079 --> 7565.599
the cgi that is the storyline

7562.48 --> 7565.598999999999
character development

7566.4 --> 7569.199
but yeah

7569.28 --> 7572.159
still interesting

7574.159 --> 7577.92
anyway

7575.76 --> 7580.2390000000005
