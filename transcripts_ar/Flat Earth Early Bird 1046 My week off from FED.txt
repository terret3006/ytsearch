385.6 --> 391.44
you're dumb asses you're terrible at

388.56 --> 394.4
divining people's feelings terrible

391.44 --> 398.88
you don't know [ __ ] about me and my

394.4 --> 401.75899999999996
motives even when i told you

417.44 --> 424.4
conjuring up motives about my feelings

421.199 --> 426.639
it's really annoying and makes you look

424.4 --> 428.88
[ __ ]

426.639 --> 430.319
right and that's why i'm boycotting the

428.88 --> 432.56

430.319 --> 435.36
because i don't want to associate with

432.56 --> 438.08

435.36 --> 440.40000000000003
retards you understand

438.08 --> 443.44

443.44 --> 446.16
my plight

not amusing embarrassing

477.49 --> 480.579
[Music]

483.84 --> 486.88
[Music]

489.44 --> 492.599

500.96 --> 503.35999999999996
jones

503.68 --> 508.96
squirting over oh no he's a eugenicist

507.12 --> 510.24
he's so evil

508.96 --> 512.399
even though he's

510.24 --> 516.24
like literally one of your freaking

512.399 --> 516.24
globe champions idiot

517.2 --> 524.36
alex jones is such a [ __ ] [ __ ]

520.399 --> 524.36
sometimes it's unbelievable

524.399 --> 527.04
so dumb

531.76 --> 536.0
you want to fill in the people who don't

533.92 --> 537.12
watch fed

536.0 --> 538.16
no

537.12 --> 539.839
maybe

538.16 --> 542.7199999999999
if somebody

539.839 --> 543.9200000000001
inquires perhaps

542.72 --> 547.12
i mean

543.92 --> 549.92
oh random watchers that don't know what

547.12 --> 552.24
fed is that watch my show

549.92 --> 552.24
well

552.399 --> 556.64
it's called internal situation

555.92 --> 560.92
it

556.64 --> 560.92
you shouldn't even be interested

564.32 --> 569.44
it's just the whole situation on

566.959 --> 571.5999999999999
thursday me talking about

569.44 --> 572.6400000000001
william shatner going up in the penis

571.6 --> 574.399
rocket

572.64 --> 576.959
me not

574.399 --> 579.76
oh i'm going to soft code i'm gonna

576.959 --> 582.4799999999999
euphemize it and just call it the blue

579.76 --> 584.48
origin and all because i don't want to

582.48 --> 586.8000000000001
call it a penis right no no i just call

584.48 --> 588.48
it a penis rocket and i even think that

586.8 --> 589.519
william shatner is fine with that

588.48 --> 590.88
because

589.519 --> 593.2
dude

590.88 --> 595.92
he's not [ __ ] he knows it looks like

593.2 --> 598.48
a penis doesn't give a [ __ ] he's like

595.92 --> 600.64
yeah yeah [ __ ] you

598.48 --> 602.0790000000001
i'm doing this i want this right i want

600.64 --> 604.3199999999999
to do that

602.079 --> 607.68
and nobody everybody's gonna think i'm

604.32 --> 610.0
gonna die because i'm 90 and they're all

607.68 --> 613.4399999999999
going to be weak and [ __ ] when

610.0 --> 615.839
they're 90 unlike me william shatner

613.44 --> 618.72
right that's what i think that happened

615.839 --> 620.48
and then he made up a whole story

618.72 --> 623.36
afterward

620.48 --> 626.16
probably to kind of pitch

623.36 --> 629.92
advertise for climate change in the

626.16 --> 631.12
coming catastrophe it's just so standard

629.92 --> 632.64
that's not like

631.12 --> 635.92
oh no

632.64 --> 640.16
oh no a dire warning

635.92 --> 643.8389999999999
alex jones you [ __ ] [ __ ]

640.16 --> 646.56
[ __ ] [ __ ] so embarrassing

643.839 --> 648.32
what you're doing man

646.56 --> 650.56
so embarrassing

648.32 --> 653.519
i mean did william

650.56 --> 654.959
even a single time

653.519 --> 658.079
mention

654.959 --> 662.2399999999999
like oh humans bad

658.079 --> 664.7199999999999
oh overpop no not a word oh no he said

662.24 --> 667.6800000000001
the word gaia oh so that automatically

664.72 --> 672.0790000000001
implies all that does it you conspire it

667.68 --> 673.5999999999999
hard over generalizing [ __ ]

672.079 --> 674.56
no he didn't

673.6 --> 677.279
right

674.56 --> 680.7199999999999
i'm just gonna keep it real and stop

677.279 --> 683.36
squirting over this old man

680.72 --> 684.8000000000001
that's still a little ambitious for his

683.36 --> 688.0
age right

684.8 --> 690.7199999999999
that's it i just wanna keep it a little

688.0 --> 690.72
realistic

693.2 --> 699.2
yeah and that's very ironic

696.56 --> 703.279
because it is pretty bizarre for an old

699.2 --> 706.8000000000001
man to actually go up in a rocket right

703.279 --> 707.92
also i have watched back again

706.8 --> 710.7199999999999
the

707.92 --> 714.3199999999999
floaty part of the video that was

710.72 --> 717.0400000000001
presented afterward very weird

714.32 --> 719.519
and you know what

717.04 --> 723.4399999999999
guys are full of [ __ ]

719.519 --> 726.24
fed you're full of [ __ ] what high wires

723.44 --> 728.8800000000001
nathan you literally pull that out of

726.24 --> 732.399
your ass there was no [ __ ] wires

728.88 --> 734.72
there there wasn't

732.399 --> 738.0
that was actually free fall

734.72 --> 740.1600000000001
fall yeah not go not floaty up there it

738.0 --> 741.36
was in the fall it was exactly like i

740.16 --> 743.1999999999999
thought it was

741.36 --> 745.2
and then i thought well maybe they did a

743.2 --> 747.6800000000001
separate scene somewhere

745.2 --> 749.519
no no they didn't i don't think they did

747.68 --> 752.16
i think that it was actually part of the

749.519 --> 754.5600000000001
ride it's just when it comes down they

752.16 --> 756.8
don't like to say it like that because

754.56 --> 759.1199999999999
they want the people

756.8 --> 760.8
to buy in the idea that if you go up

759.12 --> 762.519
really high

760.8 --> 764.3199999999999
and remain

762.519 --> 767.76
geostationary

764.32 --> 770.0
that you can then float that's the idea

767.76 --> 772.48
that's the part where the illusion comes

770.0 --> 774.72
in that doesn't happen when it comes

772.48 --> 777.519
down it happens though that's why they

774.72 --> 779.839
do a little switcheroo

777.519 --> 780.8
right it's a little shell game

779.839 --> 783.839
move

780.8 --> 785.76
you move the penis head up there and

783.839 --> 787.2
then you say oh look look there's the

785.76 --> 788.72
little ball the floaty ball it's

787.2 --> 790.8000000000001
floating up there

788.72 --> 792.5600000000001
and then it goes down then it's when

790.8 --> 794.56
it's actually floating and then they

792.56 --> 796.6389999999999
show it afterwards like oh look yeah

794.56 --> 798.2399999999999
that's when it was up there when it was

796.639 --> 801.44
already going down

798.24 --> 803.76
very basic trick

801.44 --> 805.9200000000001
very basic trick right i don't think

803.76 --> 808.8
there was high wires

805.92 --> 811.12
yeah they did the stupid spinny maneuver

808.8 --> 813.3599999999999
but that's because it's that's just the

811.12 --> 815.92
classic that's what they all do that's

813.36 --> 818.9590000000001
because oh i've seen other astronauts do

815.92 --> 821.519
that on actual high wires when it's very

818.959 --> 822.88
blatantly obvious they're wired

821.519 --> 824.48
right

822.88 --> 827.36
doesn't mean that if you're on the vomit

824.48 --> 829.12
comet that you're that you can't do that

827.36 --> 831.6
yeah you can

829.12 --> 833.279
you could actually do that and i think

831.6 --> 836.88
that they did

833.279 --> 838.399
so yeah i'm actually i'm retracting

836.88 --> 841.4399999999999
the original

838.399 --> 844.399
yeah probably and saying no there was no

841.44 --> 847.12
freaking separate scene

844.399 --> 849.12
there was no studio with wires

847.12 --> 851.76
[ __ ]

849.12 --> 855.16
that was real

851.76 --> 855.16
there you go

856.48 --> 861.1990000000001
oh john smith shut up

859.12 --> 863.68
oh let me push me around they push

861.199 --> 864.56
everybody around

863.68 --> 867.8389999999999
right

864.56 --> 869.8389999999999
at least i have something to push around

867.839 --> 870.9590000000001
i'm not some vacant little balloon

869.839 --> 873.12
that's gonna

870.959 --> 875.76
immediately respond to local air

873.12 --> 878.0
pressure differential and just adapt to

875.76 --> 880.88
whatever rolls in

878.0 --> 882.8
like some [ __ ]

880.88 --> 885.68
right and yeah yeah everybody does get a

882.8 --> 887.68
little bit trained by nathan like that

885.68 --> 890.56
to to get like that because hey if you

887.68 --> 892.7199999999999
go against it he's gonna roar at you

890.56 --> 895.199
he's gonna bite ya

892.72 --> 895.1990000000001
i know

895.6 --> 901.279
i'm not a [ __ ] [ __ ] though i am going

898.0 --> 903.92
to have my separate opinions and i will

901.279 --> 907.04
share my insights and nobody in this

903.92 --> 909.199
[ __ ] world is going to stop me

907.04 --> 911.5999999999999
like even if you'd freaking unplug me

909.199 --> 916.24
from the internet i'm still gonna do it

911.6 --> 917.44
i'm going to find somebody with a phone

916.24 --> 920.16
and then

917.44 --> 924.0790000000001
basically use their phone to do whatever

920.16 --> 925.199
right all i need is an account name

924.079 --> 927.8389999999999
login

925.199 --> 927.8389999999999
and i'll do it

930.399 --> 935.6
hell of a landing what do you mean hell

932.8 --> 935.5999999999999
of a learning

936.399 --> 940.44
what so hell about it

943.44 --> 948.1600000000001
it was just a big dust cloud

946.48 --> 952.519
that's all

948.16 --> 952.519
wasn't really a one hell of a landing

956.48 --> 962.0790000000001
no dust on the penis said oh really no

959.36 --> 964.24
no there was there absolutely was dust

962.079 --> 966.88
on it afterward george sanford what a

964.24 --> 970.0790000000001
ridiculous statement

966.88 --> 973.199
oh what because it doesn't look like

970.079 --> 977.199
there's like 10 years or 20 years worth

973.199 --> 979.279
of dust traces and moist on there

977.199 --> 981.519
oh because of that there is no moist

979.279 --> 983.8389999999999
really

981.519 --> 986.32
well i bet you that if somebody would

983.839 --> 988.32
have for the for the fun of it just gone

986.32 --> 989.279
up there and like drawn a circle or

988.32 --> 992.88
something

989.279 --> 996.24
then it would have been on there yeah

992.88 --> 999.12
and besides you don't know what material

996.24 --> 1001.92
it's made of maybe it is dust repellent

999.12 --> 1007.279
you don't know you don't know [ __ ] you

1001.92 --> 1009.68
don't know it you don't know it about it

1007.279 --> 1011.6
you don't know

1009.68 --> 1015.12
just because you believe flat earth

1011.6 --> 1018.12
doesn't mean you know everything all

1015.12 --> 1018.12
right

1041.439 --> 1046.3190000000002
right it's it's like this oh flat earth

1044.16 --> 1049.28
oh it turns out the globe was fake and

1046.319 --> 1052.24
there's almost these lies in there

1049.28 --> 1054.6399999999999
all right so now because i know that i'm

1052.24 --> 1057.36
just gonna roll the dice

1054.64 --> 1059.2
and expect that i'm gonna roll a six

1057.36 --> 1061.6
every time

1059.2 --> 1064.96
that seems to be the behavior here it's

1061.6 --> 1067.9189999999999
very embarrassing it's dumb it's like

1064.96 --> 1069.919
it's like what elitists

1067.919 --> 1071.76
have that same issue

1069.919 --> 1074.3200000000002
they get control they get power they get

1071.76 --> 1076.8799999999999
some authority and then they certainly

1074.32 --> 1079.12
turn into full-blown retards that think

1076.88 --> 1081.0390000000002
they can just sit on a pile of money

1079.12 --> 1083.1999999999998
like a dragon

1081.039 --> 1086.799
they turn [ __ ]

1083.2 --> 1088.4
they lose their actual grip on reality

1086.799 --> 1091.84
because they think they won they

1088.4 --> 1095.72
overcame it no you don't you still have

1091.84 --> 1095.72
to figure it all out

1118.0 --> 1122.64
hello ex gen

1120.559 --> 1123.6789999999999
who made it for once

1122.64 --> 1124.5590000000002
all right

1123.679 --> 1127.039
well

1124.559 --> 1131.24
i only just begun streaming 15 minutes

1127.039 --> 1131.24
ago so i'm super late

1143.84 --> 1147.52
all right so yeah that was it

1147.679 --> 1151.52
that's really

1149.6 --> 1153.039
yeah the core issue

1151.52 --> 1155.679
that it was

1153.039 --> 1157.52
that was on my heart

1155.679 --> 1160.0800000000002
it's annoying

1157.52 --> 1162.72
it's annoying to hear the guys

1160.08 --> 1165.36
like talk about me behind my back and

1162.72 --> 1166.72
get it so wrong

1165.36 --> 1169.9189999999999
so wrong

1166.72 --> 1172.64
even though i literally told them

1169.919 --> 1176.3600000000001
literally told them

1172.64 --> 1176.3600000000001
can't believe it

1185.919 --> 1189.3600000000001
yeah hello cps

1188.0 --> 1191.36
well there's always going to be some

1189.36 --> 1193.9189999999999
dust on it but you're right there there

1191.36 --> 1196.559
did seem to be like a last second

1193.919 --> 1199.039
thruster to

1196.559 --> 1200.96
to kind of give an air cushion to land

1199.039 --> 1206.28
on that

1200.96 --> 1206.28
that did stand out to me too cbs i agree

1207.919 --> 1212.5590000000002
no steamy traveler nathan does not share

1210.24 --> 1213.44
the money with the panelist panelists

1212.559 --> 1215.76
are

1213.44 --> 1218.0800000000002
voluntary

1215.76 --> 1223.44
and hey nathan actually has donated to

1218.08 --> 1225.6
my paypal occasionally not a lot he has

1223.44 --> 1225.6000000000001
so

1226.32 --> 1232.799
in that sense he does spread it around a

1228.24 --> 1232.799
little but he mostly just spends it

1233.2 --> 1237.44
like on lavish lavish birthdays of his

1236.159 --> 1238.72
daughters

1237.44 --> 1240.559
for example

1238.72 --> 1243.1200000000001
right

1240.559 --> 1245.039
i'm not gonna complain oh

1243.12 --> 1248.4799999999998
he's not good enough anymore so now i'm

1245.039 --> 1250.559
gonna like nitpick over his money no no

1248.48 --> 1253.52
no

1250.559 --> 1255.9189999999999
but what you could do

1253.52 --> 1260.44
if you don't like the way he does things

1255.919 --> 1260.44
is sponsor me more

1262.799 --> 1267.84
right you can just

1265.039 --> 1271.679
become part of my patreon

1267.84 --> 1274.6399999999999
donate to my paypal regularly

1271.679 --> 1275.6000000000001

1274.64 --> 1278.4
better

1275.6 --> 1281.039
i don't know getting a new chair

1278.4 --> 1283.44
that barely has a cushion left on it

1281.039 --> 1285.52
maybe getting new pants that is now more

1283.44 --> 1287.6000000000001
whole than pants

1285.52 --> 1290.1589999999999
getting a new air filter

1287.6 --> 1293.6789999999999
that's been sitting there dead for over

1290.159 --> 1293.679
one and a half year by now

1294.24 --> 1298.48
right

1295.44 --> 1301.679
i could use the money like when while he

1298.48 --> 1303.039
nathan is upgrading his studio like what

1301.679 --> 1304.4
is it worth

1303.039 --> 1306.559
thousands

1304.4 --> 1308.0800000000002
of pounds

1306.559 --> 1308.8799999999999
by now

1308.08 --> 1310.72
yeah

1308.88 --> 1313.2
super

1310.72 --> 1316.159
super expensive little sound studio he

1313.2 --> 1320.48
made it it's really cool yeah i'd like

1316.159 --> 1322.3200000000002
to have some basic equipment and clothes

1320.48 --> 1325.84
how about that

1322.32 --> 1328.24
right that requires real support

1325.84 --> 1330.72
right now right now i'm just

1328.24 --> 1333.84
getting by being able to eat and that

1330.72 --> 1333.84
makes me happy enough

1340.32 --> 1344.6399999999999
hey godzilla

1342.24 --> 1346.799
37 thank you for the five

1344.64 --> 1348.88
the canadian dollar super chat donation

1346.799 --> 1351.44
man doesn't stand on this principle

1348.88 --> 1353.8400000000001
stands on nothing at all

1351.44 --> 1356.0
good in you but for our sakes i hope

1353.84 --> 1358.24
nathan does the right thing yeah

1356.0 --> 1360.559
what's up to him you know it's not like

1358.24 --> 1362.4
the first time

1360.559 --> 1363.28
this straight

1362.4 --> 1366.48
dude

1363.28 --> 1369.2
i don't know if you realize but nathan

1366.48 --> 1370.96
is not walking the path of christ he

1369.2 --> 1374.32
doesn't give a [ __ ] about that do you

1370.96 --> 1375.76
realize that nathan is pretty much an

1374.32 --> 1378.1589999999999
atheist

1375.76 --> 1381.52
when it comes down to it he really is

1378.159 --> 1384.4
he's a guy that deems it more important

1381.52 --> 1387.12
to do whatever he likes

1384.4 --> 1390.0
however he sees fit

1387.12 --> 1392.7199999999998
recognizes nobody above him

1390.0 --> 1394.4
but he does recognize creation

1392.72 --> 1396.32
right he doesn't recognize the

1394.4 --> 1397.919
architecture

1396.32 --> 1401.039
i don't know what he feels about it i

1397.919 --> 1403.2
don't think he cares he just wants to

1401.039 --> 1406.2
grind down on anti-flat earthers and

1403.2 --> 1406.2
globers

1418.159 --> 1422.5590000000002

1565.36 --> 1570.8799999999999
fantasy right where you can dream about

1568.08 --> 1572.8799999999999
how i'm opposing nathan

right

1572.88 --> 1577.6000000000001
i'm not gonna give you that luxury

you're still [ __ ] the earth is still

1577.6 --> 1580.6
flat

1594.32 --> 1599.76
well cps that's look if you is doing

1597.679 --> 1602.0
well off his back well are you saying

1599.76 --> 1603.96
that those people that donate to him are

1602.0 --> 1606.799
doing it

1603.96 --> 1608.799
involuntarily what a kind of ridiculous

1606.799 --> 1610.8799999999999
statement is that no

1608.799 --> 1612.4
nathan has fans

1610.88 --> 1615.5200000000002
and they support him

1612.4 --> 1616.96
and they probably want him to sit on a

1615.52 --> 1620.1589999999999
pile of money

1616.96 --> 1622.08
you know and nathan is kind of fat

1620.159 --> 1626.4
yeah

1622.08 --> 1629.76
nathan calling shatner a fat old man

1626.4 --> 1633.52
how the [ __ ] dare you okay i'd like to

1629.76 --> 1636.24
see you look as good when you're 90

1633.52 --> 1638.559
when you're in your 40s and you're like

1636.24 --> 1641.2
that yeah i'd like to see you pull

1638.559 --> 1644.32
another 50 years like this nathan how

1641.2 --> 1645.919
the [ __ ] dare you call shatner fat

1644.32 --> 1646.6399999999999
even though he is bit

1645.919 --> 1649.6000000000001
but

1646.64 --> 1653.72
it's ridiculous to hear you say that

1649.6 --> 1653.7199999999998
it's absolutely embarrassing

1665.84 --> 1670.559
he's

1666.96 --> 1670.559
no that's ridiculous cbs

1671.039 --> 1674.96
doing well off the backs of people like

1673.84 --> 1676.08
me

1674.96 --> 1676.88
no it's

1676.08 --> 1679.039
no

1676.88 --> 1681.0390000000002
why are you saying that

1679.039 --> 1683.2
what you really think that this

1681.039 --> 1684.64
blabbering is going to make me

1683.2 --> 1686.799
permanently

1684.64 --> 1688.72
stop going there

1686.799 --> 1691.279
you really think

1688.72 --> 1692.72
you could pull that off you really think

1691.279 --> 1695.039
that

1692.72 --> 1697.6000000000001
it's never going to happen i will go

1695.039 --> 1699.44
back just despite you

1697.6 --> 1701.52
all right but i'm not gonna do it today

1699.44 --> 1704.3200000000002
because i said i wouldn't come on for a

1701.52 --> 1707.76
week and i won't

1704.32 --> 1710.6399999999999
because nathan needs to know

1707.76 --> 1713.44
with his ego he needs to know

1710.64 --> 1715.8400000000001
that you can't just sloppily

1713.44 --> 1718.24
shove arwin aside when he's actually

1715.84 --> 1720.24
making a real point

1718.24 --> 1722.48
you can't do that

1720.24 --> 1725.039
not without consequences

1722.48 --> 1727.52
you're gonna feel it even though it's

1725.039 --> 1729.919
barely anything it's just me not showing

1727.52 --> 1732.24
up and you having to deal

1729.919 --> 1734.48
with the rest of the panel without an

1732.24 --> 1736.0
arwin to actually

1734.48 --> 1738.88
diplomize

1736.0 --> 1741.679
the situation which i do naturally and

1738.88 --> 1744.679
i'm very good at it unlike you

1741.679 --> 1744.679
nathan

1752.55 --> 1756.01
[Music]

1775.36 --> 1780.399
it's just

1777.44 --> 1782.799
dude bad karma

1780.399 --> 1785.12
have you ever considered that maybe the

1782.799 --> 1789.12
panelists just do it because they want

1785.12 --> 1791.36
to or that they use fed

1789.12 --> 1794.32
as an advertisement platform for

1791.36 --> 1796.9599999999998
themselves it's a mutual relationship

1794.32 --> 1798.8799999999999
become part of the panel

1796.96 --> 1800.24
you get

1798.88 --> 1802.3990000000001
the

1800.24 --> 1804.64
yeah the attention

1802.399 --> 1806.7199999999998
fed gets a lot of attention there's a

1804.64 --> 1810.3200000000002
lot of influx of watchers because

1806.72 --> 1812.32
there's a lot of premieres lots of them

1810.32 --> 1814.32
there's constant influx there's constant

1812.32 --> 1817.52
attention

1814.32 --> 1819.52
fed has become relatively high profile

1817.52 --> 1822.24
enough in

1819.52 --> 1824.799
in the flatter scene got some shout outs

1822.24 --> 1827.36
here and there people know him

1824.799 --> 1830.799
no he's around even though everybody oh

1827.36 --> 1833.84
they can't handle it oh it's so mean why

1830.799 --> 1837.1589999999999
isn't here why isn't nathan more polite

1833.84 --> 1837.1589999999999
in npr

1837.2 --> 1842.88
yeah that's because you're [ __ ]

1838.96 --> 1846.159
[ __ ] and npr is [ __ ] [ __ ] and

1842.88 --> 1849.48
dishonest for wussies

1846.159 --> 1849.48
that's why

1863.44 --> 1867.44
looking forward to standing my ground

1865.36 --> 1868.8799999999999
more force now that's impossible steamy

1867.44 --> 1872.64
traveler

1868.88 --> 1875.279
i was pretty forceful and i left because

1872.64 --> 1878.7990000000002
yeah if you get forceful nathan is going

1875.279 --> 1882.159
to mute you even if you're right

1878.799 --> 1883.9189999999999
right he doesn't give a [ __ ]

1882.159 --> 1886.5590000000002
if he's making a point and you're gonna

1883.919 --> 1888.96
get loud and maybe

1886.559 --> 1892.08
somewhat rampassy he is just going to

1888.96 --> 1896.0
mute you he doesn't give a [ __ ] you

1892.08 --> 1898.32
understand he doesn't give his [ __ ]

1896.0 --> 1901.36
doesn't give a [ __ ] if i'm our win

1898.32 --> 1904.48
or tenth man or brian getting agitated

1901.36 --> 1906.8799999999999
doesn't care he if you are going against

1904.48 --> 1908.64
him he will mute you

1906.88 --> 1910.3990000000001
unless

1908.64 --> 1913.519
you really got a point

1910.399 --> 1915.6
and he is in the mood to correct himself

1913.519 --> 1919.24
over that

1915.6 --> 1919.24
which is rare

1932.48 --> 1937.679
why don't you stop whining about it now

1935.2 --> 1941.679
that karma is getting really on my

1937.679 --> 1945.76
nerves stop whining about nathan

1941.679 --> 1948.48
stop being a little [ __ ]

1945.76 --> 1952.32
stop complaining about the man that

1948.48 --> 1955.3600000000001
raped your feelings okay stop whining

1952.32 --> 1957.76
about him it's getting really annoying

1955.36 --> 1959.84
if you don't shut the [ __ ] up about

1957.76 --> 1962.48
whining about every [ __ ] thing he

1959.84 --> 1963.6
does i'm gonna ban you

1962.48 --> 1968.84
hear me

1963.6 --> 1968.84
i'm sick of your whining about him

1992.72 --> 1998.279
huh

1994.88 --> 1998.279
hello exgin

2007.6 --> 2011.1999999999998
yeah i don't know either richie red

2009.84 --> 2015.039
wretched

2011.2 --> 2018.3990000000001
i have no idea why he did that

2015.039 --> 2020.64
it was really unexpected when he did but

2018.399 --> 2023.6
then again maybe nathan is just in the

2020.64 --> 2024.96
works of just trying to find targets to

2023.6 --> 2026.32
[ __ ] on

2024.96 --> 2028.559
with well

2026.32 --> 2030.6399999999999
the amount of anti-flat earthers

2028.559 --> 2033.9189999999999
actually taking a risk and getting on

2030.64 --> 2037.039
the panel is dying down

2033.919 --> 2039.279
and he's doing it himself you know he is

2037.039 --> 2039.279
like

2039.44 --> 2044.3990000000001
banning them

2041.84 --> 2047.12
in my personal opinion banning rumpus

2044.399 --> 2049.1189999999997
even though he's a lying scumbag totally

2047.12 --> 2052.6389999999997
agree with that banning him was the

2049.119 --> 2055.9190000000003
worst decision he ever made for a show

2052.639 --> 2060.96
the worst decision you ever made nathan

2055.919 --> 2062.879
it was the worst decision you ever made

2060.96 --> 2064.7200000000003
after you banned him

2062.879 --> 2069.5989999999997
officially

2064.72 --> 2072.48
it's all starting to die down since then

2069.599 --> 2075.119
before that time there was ballers

2072.48 --> 2077.52
always getting ready to get on always do

2075.119 --> 2080.639
you remember that nathan

2077.52 --> 2083.2
before you decided to ban rumpus and

2080.639 --> 2085.9190000000003
that suddenly all started to grind to a

2083.2 --> 2088.96
halt you remember that

2085.919 --> 2091.2799999999997
been trying to tell you for like a year

2088.96 --> 2091.28
now

2092.24 --> 2097.1189999999997
right so he's just looking for a target

2095.04 --> 2098.32
to [ __ ] on and in this case it was

2097.119 --> 2102.32
shatner

2098.32 --> 2104.48
and it was a very obvious target to pick

2102.32 --> 2107.76
i don't pick him though for that because

2104.48 --> 2107.76
i find it embarrassing

2107.92 --> 2111.599
i find it embarrassing to do that

2114.48 --> 2122.2
if he was not on his rocket would there

2117.119 --> 2122.2000000000003
even be an argument no there wouldn't be

2137.359 --> 2141.2
no

2138.64 --> 2145.16
you're a numpty stinky durable look at

2141.2 --> 2145.16
your [ __ ] name

2176.48 --> 2181.2
no banning good

2178.24 --> 2183.9199999999996
banning good texture mix what kind of a

2181.2 --> 2183.9199999999996
name is that

2184.079 --> 2189.04
banning good you come in with stupid

2186.079 --> 2190.2400000000002
soccer counts say stupid things i will

2189.04 --> 2192.64
ban you

2190.24 --> 2194.64
i just happen to know that stinky gerbil

2192.64 --> 2196.48
is actually

2194.64 --> 2199.52
a real person

2196.48 --> 2201.839
weirdly enough but yeah nathan is not a

2199.52 --> 2201.839
numpty

2202.64 --> 2207.839
it's just a dick sometimes

2206.24 --> 2209.839
and he gets

2207.839 --> 2211.599
like careless

2209.839 --> 2215.48
that's a problem that's a character

2211.599 --> 2215.48
problem carelessness

2221.2 --> 2227.68
but banning romp is bad yeah

2224.88 --> 2228.6400000000003
yeah from my chat banning good

2227.68 --> 2231.7599999999998
but

2228.64 --> 2233.44
nathan should have never banned rumpus

2231.76 --> 2235.3590000000004
permanently that is he should have

2233.44 --> 2237.2000000000003
kicked him out of course plenty of times

2235.359 --> 2239.92
but he should have never like officially

2237.2 --> 2241.9199999999996
banned him from discord like that

2239.92 --> 2244.2400000000002
it's the worst decision he ever made

2241.92 --> 2245.839
after that point the amount of anti-flat

2244.24 --> 2247.52
earthers getting on

2245.839 --> 2251.92
died down

2247.52 --> 2256.2
and has kept on dying down now it's rare

2251.92 --> 2256.2000000000003
it's a waste what a waste

2258.88 --> 2263.119
who is my most closest and most

2261.359 --> 2265.92
supportive friend that you have in the

2263.119 --> 2265.92

2289.599 --> 2294.48

i mean i have thought about it but

2444.64 --> 2447.64
nope

2458.4 --> 2462.4
you don't waste your time with people

2460.56 --> 2465.68
like nathan oh well

2462.4 --> 2467.599
that's your prerogative a mildly higher

2465.68 --> 2469.2799999999997
primate

2467.599 --> 2472.1600000000003
the [ __ ]

2469.28 --> 2473.76
who the hell calls themselves that

2472.16 --> 2475.839
if you don't want to waste your time

2473.76 --> 2477.6800000000003
with them

2475.839 --> 2479.599
go right ahead

2477.68 --> 2484.64
just know that

2479.599 --> 2486.7200000000003
concerning like 90 to 98 percent

2484.64 --> 2490.4
nathan and me share

2486.72 --> 2490.3999999999996
the same opinions

2492.319 --> 2498.88
right especially when it comes to

2494.319 --> 2498.88
academic and philosophical opinions

2500.56 --> 2505.2
so yeah if you don't want to waste your

2502.56 --> 2506.7999999999997
time with people like nathan then

2505.2 --> 2509.839
you might not realize that you're

2506.8 --> 2512.2400000000002
wasting your time with people like irwin

2509.839 --> 2512.24
as well

2512.72 --> 2517.5989999999997
because if you're gonna shout your

2514.8 --> 2518.6400000000003
chance i will grind down on you just the

2517.599 --> 2520.1600000000003
same

2518.64 --> 2521.52
maybe not as

2520.16 --> 2524.3999999999996
hardcore

2521.52 --> 2526.48
or maybe i will sometimes i do when i

2524.4 --> 2528.48
feel like it

2526.48 --> 2532.319
i tend to be a little bit more

2528.48 --> 2532.319
analytical and personal

2532.56 --> 2537.44
divine your feelings

2534.56 --> 2539.7599999999998
actually properly in the process right

2537.44 --> 2541.92
because i can do that i'm actually good

2539.76 --> 2543.92
at that unlike nathan

2541.92 --> 2546.079
and other people although he is decent

2543.92 --> 2548.16
at it sometimes

2546.079 --> 2549.28
but it's only with the more predictable

2548.16 --> 2552.7999999999997
people

2549.28 --> 2554.96
like he does know how to divine

2552.8 --> 2557.28
like how anti-flat earthers proceed

2554.96 --> 2559.04
because it's very predictable it

2557.28 --> 2563.3190000000004
doesn't take like

2559.04 --> 2563.319
an empath to do that

2570.24 --> 2577.72
jesus had a side hustle as a carpenter

2574.4 --> 2577.7200000000003
that's hilarious

2578.24 --> 2582.0
yeah yeah yeah i guess

2582.319 --> 2585.52
that's hilarious man

2591.44 --> 2597.92
what did jesus make

2593.52 --> 2599.04
well maybe jesus made the the table

2597.92 --> 2601.359
and

2599.04 --> 2604.48
the spoons

2601.359 --> 2605.7599999999998
and the chairs

2604.48 --> 2608.319
and like

2605.76 --> 2608.3190000000004
everything

2608.72 --> 2612.48
right

2609.76 --> 2615.0400000000004
remember the last supper ever considered

2612.48 --> 2616.64
that he might have made all

2615.04 --> 2618.0
like the bench

2616.64 --> 2620.96
the table

2618.0 --> 2623.359
the chairs that everybody was using that

2620.96 --> 2625.359
maybe jesus made those have you ever

2623.359 --> 2628.96
even thought about that never even

2625.359 --> 2628.96
realized like hey who made that

2629.359 --> 2634.56
he wasn't a carpenter he was a carpenter

2631.2 --> 2636.8799999999997
right so he probably made those chairs

2634.56 --> 2638.96
that and the table that everybody was

2636.88 --> 2641.04
sitting at

2638.96 --> 2643.119
in the last supper

2641.04 --> 2645.7599999999998
i hope you didn't make her no that's not

2643.119 --> 2645.76
carpentry

2646.8 --> 2649.8390000000004
that really is not

2659.28 --> 2665.119
besides he didn't do carpentry for the

2661.76 --> 2666.079
romans if you know what i mean

2665.119 --> 2668.96
jews

2666.079 --> 2668.96
didn't do that

2669.76 --> 2674.96
nothing in the bible about jesus making

2672.0 --> 2678.64
tables right well there's a whole chunk

2674.96 --> 2681.599
of his life missing entirely

2678.64 --> 2683.839
and he was a carpenter wasn't he

2681.599 --> 2686.319
so maybe they just didn't think it was

2683.839 --> 2686.319
important

2689.359 --> 2693.839
no doubt he would have made my stuff for

2691.359 --> 2696.64
his mother and did he have an aunt

2693.839 --> 2700.359
an aunt i didn't know that

2696.64 --> 2700.359
for his mother perhaps

2725.599 --> 2729.599
jesus would have liked that joke i don't

2727.599 --> 2732.599
know

2729.599 --> 2732.599
maybe

2741.599 --> 2746.839
don't do that bad karma don't

2750.079 --> 2754.5600000000004
remember how he he

2751.839 --> 2756.0789999999997
threw them the money changers out of the

2754.56 --> 2759.52
temple

2756.079 --> 2762.0
don't start saying oh he sold booze on

2759.52 --> 2765.119
the side that's

2762.0 --> 2769.119
really really disrespectful and proves

2765.119 --> 2769.119
that you absolutely don't get it

2772.88 --> 2776.7200000000003
his aunt was elizabeth mother of john

2775.599 --> 2778.4
the bath oh

2776.72 --> 2780.8799999999997
huh

2778.4 --> 2780.88
all right

2784.8 --> 2789.319
i'll take your word on that interesting

2814.839 --> 2820.4
hmm all right

2817.92 --> 2820.4
anyway

2824.4 --> 2828.079
i think i'm gonna round out this show

2829.119 --> 2833.04
i said everything i wanted to say

2836.4 --> 2840.2400000000002
got all that crap of my chest

2841.04 --> 2845.44
and uh yeah

2842.96 --> 2848.7200000000003
pointing out how wrong

2845.44 --> 2852.079
the fad crowd was

2848.72 --> 2855.4399999999996
in their divining of my motivations why

2852.079 --> 2857.52
i did what i did on thursday

2855.44 --> 2860.88
and then they still got it wrong after i

2857.52 --> 2864.319
did an entire show about it on friday

2860.88 --> 2868.4

2864.319 --> 2868.4
