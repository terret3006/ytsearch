so yeah please get the support flowing

88.5 --> 90.74
again

91.259 --> 96.54
right whether today

94.02 --> 99.65899999999999
well right now it's kind of sunny again

96.54 --> 101.52000000000001
but yeah there are some clouds

99.659 --> 105.18
it's very hazy

101.52 --> 108.119
and it's actually been kind of clouded

105.18 --> 110.82000000000001
all day and in the night it has rained a

108.119 --> 113.46
bit not hard or anything but

110.82 --> 116.83999999999999
a little

113.46 --> 116.83999999999999
just a little splash

117.659 --> 123.899
so yeah it definitely cooled down a lot

121.079 --> 127.219
but with the direct Sun hitting again

123.899 --> 127.219
yeah it is warmer

127.259 --> 132.0
there's a bit of wind but it's not

129.959 --> 133.98
really substantial and yeah there's a

132.0 --> 137.0
lot of moist in the air amplifying the

133.98 --> 137.0
experience of the Heat

140.14 --> 143.32999999999998
[Music]

143.4 --> 150.18
don't see any Trails being left today

147.48 --> 152.28
planes flying over but no not leaving

150.18 --> 156.0
trails

152.28 --> 156.0
right ah

156.3 --> 160.699
Halo

157.49 --> 160.699
[Music]

163.26 --> 166.16
tuning in

166.7 --> 173.28
from the Planet Krypton

169.64 --> 176.11999999999998
is our win

173.28 --> 176.12
my friends

181.22 --> 190.86
right so it is Tuesday the uh 12th of

187.14 --> 190.85999999999999
September 2023

191.04 --> 194.239
let's check the temperature

197.22 --> 204.659
23 degrees right yeah that's a lot less

201.0 --> 204.659
and 28.30

208.44 --> 213.68
and it looks like it's kind of gonna

210.9 --> 213.68
stay that way

214.08 --> 216.68
all right

219.959 --> 224.23
still kind of decent just not that

222.959 --> 226.08
blazing hot

224.23 --> 228.42
[Music]

226.08 --> 231.86
I'm kind of glad because now I can get

228.42 --> 234.23899999999998
more moving and more energy without

231.86 --> 238.09900000000002
immediately bursting out in sweating

234.239 --> 238.09900000000002
which is really annoying and distracting

238.44 --> 246.379
uh does not help

242.04 --> 246.379
so I think I can do better shows even

247.92 --> 253.5
don't have to go bare chested right so

251.819 --> 255.1
now I'm just hoping somebody's actually

253.5 --> 258.459
gonna show up

255.1 --> 258.459
[Music]

258.66 --> 263.18
I am

260.519 --> 263.18
earlier

264.419 --> 270.78
but I mean yeah the the heat wave did

267.06 --> 274.4
kind of pass so that was the reason

270.78 --> 278.11999999999995
I.E LSG first in chat good to see you

274.4 --> 278.12
good morning to you

282.78 --> 287.94
so I think the weather is probably

284.88 --> 289.68
pretty synchronized right now across the

287.94 --> 292.699
northern

289.68 --> 297.44
north of the equator Northern Hemisphere

292.699 --> 297.44
uh language habits

304.139 --> 310.56
since yesterday was already kind of like

306.36 --> 313.86
cloudy and cool down in America

310.56 --> 317.54
so I predict that's probably happening

313.86 --> 321.08000000000004
here and in England

317.54 --> 321.08000000000004
buggy good to see you

326.039 --> 329.0
hello us

332.4 --> 340.09999999999997
right so I'm stocked up here

336.78 --> 340.09999999999997
Illuminati casa

342.0 --> 344.82
gusto

343.23 --> 347.47900000000004
[Music]

344.82 --> 347.479
Rook

347.88 --> 350.88
minty

352.919 --> 358.19899999999996
all good to go

355.32 --> 361.82
on this less than two hour show I'm

358.199 --> 361.82
gonna have to get used to that again

364.38 --> 368.88
[Music]

366.02 --> 371.34
but there's always the weekends and I'll

368.88 --> 373.86
probably be doing like four hour shows

371.34 --> 376.69899999999996
in the weekends now

373.86 --> 376.699
I suspect

379.74 --> 383.72
right so yeah what are you guys up to

385.8 --> 392.24
uh

388.08 --> 395.039
there's no Owen Benjamin or not yet

392.24 --> 398.419
that was a bit weird I expected there to

395.039 --> 398.419
be own Benjamin life yesterday

398.759 --> 401.66
since it's Monday

402.06 --> 405.5
but there was not

405.78 --> 413.4
sorry re-watched a bit of uh Friday show

410.4 --> 415.31899999999996
the recording was all off with like the

413.4 --> 416.94
video and the sound and that's really

415.319 --> 420.24
distracting

416.94 --> 422.88
because I do actually like to watch him

420.24 --> 424.8
his face like how he talks and all that

422.88 --> 426.0
and then it's very distracting when that

424.8 --> 429.139
happens

426.0 --> 429.139
but uh

430.62 --> 435.08
looking forward to a new own Benjamin

437.34 --> 442.61999999999995
oh and by the way I think he already

439.319 --> 446.40000000000003
actually did uh

442.62 --> 448.74
abide by the bear chest challenge I

446.4 --> 451.62
realize in that very video he played

448.74 --> 453.419
somewhere he was like having a vest over

451.62 --> 456.9
his bare chest

453.419 --> 458.639
I don't know how old that video was but

456.9 --> 462.35999999999996
anyway

458.639 --> 464.699
low low fruit let's see you watching

462.36 --> 468.139
flatzord from yesterday

464.699 --> 468.139
stream guys nuked

469.139 --> 472.699
you mean just interrupted

482.0 --> 487.8
I mean the Channel's still there and all

484.5 --> 489.0
so it's just probably copyright

487.8 --> 491.90000000000003
really

489.0 --> 491.9
what the hell

492.479 --> 495.38
over what

497.28 --> 505.44
content from National Geographic wow

502.44 --> 505.44
okay

510.24 --> 512.66
yeah

512.88 --> 519.419
yeah no that is let me just

516.3 --> 521.459
yeah you can check it out yourself

519.419 --> 523.76
this is last night's video and it does

521.459 --> 523.76
say

534.3 --> 539.16
right so yeah that's why you shouldn't

536.94 --> 542.0400000000001
that's why I don't

539.16 --> 543.12
use any material

542.04 --> 545.6999999999999
right

543.12 --> 548.22
because oh yes the whole time it's like

545.7 --> 552.0
oh yeah that's just fine if you use it

548.22 --> 554.22
but then sadly no it's not fine now you

552.0 --> 556.38
now they copyrighted for it because they

554.22 --> 559.9200000000001
just choose to for some reason

556.38 --> 562.74
they might even do it retroactively so

559.92 --> 566.04
that's why I don't typically have video

562.74 --> 568.8
materials or stuff that I play right

566.04 --> 571.1999999999999
unless it's of people

568.8 --> 573.7199999999999
I mean I'll show a still picture right I

571.2 --> 575.76
mean they can't just National Geographic

573.72 --> 579.14
wouldn't strike you for slowing it

575.76 --> 579.14
showing a still picture

580.74 --> 585.3
Arena algorithm probably wouldn't even

583.019 --> 586.86
pick up on it they probably caught it on

585.3 --> 589.5
the music that was used in National

586.86 --> 591.839
Geographic

589.5 --> 594.3
that's usually how they catch you

591.839 --> 596.839
I mean it's extremely hard to get things

594.3 --> 596.8389999999999
on pictures

597.54 --> 600.36
it really is

599.1 --> 603.86
okay

600.36 --> 606.839
like you have to have like

603.86 --> 609.24
distinctly recognizable faces or

606.839 --> 612.4200000000001
something right

609.24 --> 615.12
and even that's not easy

612.42 --> 618.06
but music

615.12 --> 620.82
right certain sound clips that is very

618.06 --> 622.3199999999999
easy because we don't manipulate the

620.82 --> 623.7600000000001
sound Clips you see

622.32 --> 626.4590000000001
typically

623.76 --> 629.8199999999999
when we just edit stuff we might

626.459 --> 633.8389999999999
rearrange some of it but we don't

629.82 --> 637.519
actually like nudge the sound or in some

633.839 --> 640.2
way very rare like reform it

637.519 --> 643.5
some sound artists may do that if the

640.2 --> 644.4590000000001
like the it's like a comedy video or

643.5 --> 646.14
something

644.459 --> 649.14
creative thing

646.14 --> 651.48
but mostly most people just kind of copy

649.14 --> 654.0
sound so that is much more recognizable

651.48 --> 655.44
by the algorithm for copyright strike

654.0 --> 659.22
purposes

655.44 --> 662.1
compared to just still images

659.22 --> 663.779
which is like yeah people can literally

662.1 --> 666.14
mimic something

663.779 --> 669.36
like

666.14 --> 672.24
redraw it to resemble something else

669.36 --> 674.339
perfectly it's like and that people do

672.24 --> 675.9590000000001
that I mean artists do that so it's like

674.339 --> 678.48
let's just

675.959 --> 681.0189999999999
you can't this is what I'm saying you

678.48 --> 681.019
can't really

681.12 --> 686.04
get massive algorithmic searches on

684.0 --> 688.13
video material

686.04 --> 690.06
but you can on sound

688.13 --> 692.279
[Music]

690.06 --> 694.0189999999999
so always be careful like what sound

692.279 --> 695.3389999999999
you're gonna be playing because that's

694.019 --> 696.9590000000001
the first thing that's going to be

695.339 --> 700.5790000000001
hooked

696.959 --> 700.579
some general tips that

703.74 --> 708.899
right people that just play Still

706.56 --> 711.38
pictures they don't get copyright

708.899 --> 711.38
strikes

711.959 --> 716.88
and with video reviewing it's different

714.0 --> 720.24
because then you have to like

716.88 --> 721.18
breaks and commentary that's just

720.24 --> 722.519
YouTube rules

721.18 --> 725.12
[Music]

722.519 --> 725.12
anyway

730.079 --> 733.8199999999999
you think he can appeal

734.88 --> 739.139
okay maybe

735.98 --> 739.139
[Music]

740.54 --> 747.42
like I had a couple of sort of uh

744.18 --> 749.399
copyright strike on music tracks or no

747.42 --> 751.019
wait one time I played like the Lord of

749.399 --> 754.92
the Rings a scene because I thought it

751.019 --> 757.64
was like symbolic but oh you can do that

754.92 --> 757.64
but then

758.18 --> 764.9399999999999
YouTube did give me the option to

761.04 --> 767.76
basically like blot out the sound track

764.94 --> 770.399
so that's just muted that part is muted

767.76 --> 773.16
and that would fix it so I could

770.399 --> 776.339
literally show the visuals

773.16 --> 778.9399999999999
I just could not have the sound

776.339 --> 778.94
huh

783.6 --> 786.3000000000001
really

784.45 --> 790.639
[Music]

786.3 --> 790.639
that's how it works anyway cheers guys

793.52 --> 796.649
[Music]

797.22 --> 803.82
right

799.8 --> 808.019
so yeah music is much more copyrightable

803.82 --> 810.72
than visuals on average

808.019 --> 812.88
and the funny thing is though is that

810.72 --> 815.22
if you're a bit creative with music well

812.88 --> 816.8389999999999
then you can literally bypass a lot of

815.22 --> 818.24
copyright [ __ ]

816.839 --> 821.8800000000001
you know how

818.24 --> 824.639
by playing it yourself

821.88 --> 827.7
cover bands

824.639 --> 830.399
and there are lots of like media people

827.7 --> 832.62
that do that they have friends or they

830.399 --> 835.76
are in a band and they play their music

832.62 --> 838.86
and that like even if it's literally

835.76 --> 842.279
directly a cover of some famous

838.86 --> 844.639
song they'll never get copyright struck

842.279 --> 844.639
for it

844.92 --> 850.079
see even though it is like very

847.74 --> 851.66
recognizable and copyrighted song If

850.079 --> 854.8199999999999
they play it themselves

851.66 --> 856.92
nobody's ever gonna strike it

854.82 --> 859.0790000000001
because that works so here's some

856.92 --> 861.8389999999999
general advice

859.079 --> 864.2399999999999
oh yeah and I did not read through

861.839 --> 866.2790000000001
manuals and blah blah blah whatever this

864.24 --> 868.62
is just logical thinking and

866.279 --> 871.22
based on my own experience in the field

868.62 --> 871.22
thus far

871.38 --> 874.679
[Music]

883.38 --> 887.82
it doesn't harm the channel no because

885.48 --> 891.24
it's not a community guideline strike

887.82 --> 893.88
only Community guidelight strikes like

891.24 --> 895.44
you get one warning two warning and if

893.88 --> 896.9399999999999
you violate the third warning your

895.44 --> 899.399
channel goes down

896.94 --> 901.8800000000001
but copyright strikes it doesn't work

899.399 --> 901.88
like that

907.519 --> 912.66
although like if you're just a channel

910.44 --> 914.1600000000001
that purely copies somebody else's

912.66 --> 915.68
material

914.16 --> 919.5
verbatim

915.68 --> 922.68
then yeah then they get more dramatic

919.5 --> 923.88
and just delete your channel sometimes

922.68 --> 926.8199999999999
right

923.88 --> 929.72
they they go on an investigation

926.82 --> 933.019
if that seems to be the case sometimes

929.72 --> 933.019
but uh

938.519 --> 943.32
gaze flying sound

940.92 --> 947.16
yeah that is the sign of

943.32 --> 950.9590000000001
season ends hasn't happened here yet

947.16 --> 950.959
but I mean it's still very warm

957.38 --> 960.559
[Music]

965.72 --> 971.339
Water by the way also good like really

969.0 --> 973.019
raised a lot

971.339 --> 975.5400000000001
overnight somehow

973.019 --> 978.48
I wonder if other parts of the of my

975.54 --> 980.459
Nate of my condition of the Netherlands

978.48 --> 982.5
for the South had more rain or something

980.459 --> 984.8
because like the water did seem to rise

982.5 --> 984.8
a bit

986.699 --> 990.4399999999999
like at least a foot

990.74 --> 993.74
foreign

994.279 --> 998.54
maybe I'm just wrong I don't know

1000.139 --> 1004.759
but yeah the water can rise pretty much

1002.54 --> 1007.699
when there's a lot of rain

1004.759 --> 1009.5
there has been but I mean there like we

1007.699 --> 1010.459
got

1009.5 --> 1013.399
like

1010.459 --> 1015.5
water height regulation systems like

1013.399 --> 1018.519
throughout the city and all that

1015.5 --> 1018.519
little barriers

1018.8 --> 1023.9799999999999
that can determine basically how high

1020.839 --> 1023.98
the water is and all that

1024.079 --> 1028.959
so it might also have something to do

1026.059 --> 1028.959
with that I don't know

1029.54 --> 1036.459
because the water hides in the channels

1032.48 --> 1036.459
everywhere are continually regulated

1040.869 --> 1047.4389999999999
[Music]

1043.4 --> 1047.439
hey seeking star water good to see you

1048.14 --> 1051.3400000000001
flash flood warning

1053.179 --> 1055.66
okay

1058.34 --> 1063.4399999999998
does that risk literally count for your

1061.039 --> 1067.06
home as well or is it like

1063.44 --> 1070.3
the town nearby or something

1067.06 --> 1070.3
[Music]

1074.73 --> 1080.8600000000001
[Music]

1077.6 --> 1080.86
it's going to be a cold winter

1081.26 --> 1086.539
well winter is like

1083.539 --> 1088.72
in North America do seem to get kind of

1086.539 --> 1088.72
cold

1091.1 --> 1096.76
like

1093.26 --> 1096.76
above middle America

1096.86 --> 1100.78
middle United States I mean

1103.22 --> 1109.72
like you got a lot cold like your

1105.2 --> 1109.72
Winters are like Norway's Winters

1116.78 --> 1123.2
although nor May might even be more even

1120.2 --> 1126.02
worse sometimes I don't know

1123.2 --> 1129.0800000000002
I mean it's not exactly like about the

1126.02 --> 1132.1
the parallel to the equator like where

1129.08 --> 1132.1
it is exactly

1133.16 --> 1139.72
it's all a bit Shifty because it's like

1135.86 --> 1139.7199999999998
these lines are just like curved

1140.72 --> 1145.52
I used to be very fascinated about these

1143.6 --> 1148.9399999999998
divisions

1145.52 --> 1150.799
like why is it like warmer further north

1148.94 --> 1153.14
and like because that's like so

1150.799 --> 1154.94
dramatically impactful

1153.14 --> 1156.6200000000001
but it's like I always was fascinated

1154.94 --> 1159.3200000000002
like what about

1156.62 --> 1161.6599999999999
like the land and and what's going on

1159.32 --> 1163.76
makes that happen

1161.66 --> 1166.28
I used to be very fascinated with that

1163.76 --> 1169.76
as a kid and that expressed itself also

1166.28 --> 1173.4189999999999
in my map drawing efforts which I really

1169.76 --> 1175.7
started doing like around 12.

1173.419 --> 1178.1000000000001
just completely by myself and it would

1175.7 --> 1181.78
start to basically draw Game maps

1178.1 --> 1181.78
game maps

1183.38 --> 1189.6200000000001
from because I was always like designing

1186.2 --> 1192.14
video games in in my head and on paper

1189.62 --> 1193.9399999999998
or like a video game that I like and

1192.14 --> 1197.179
then I would like try to fit like

1193.94 --> 1200.66
imagine levels of it

1197.179 --> 1203.47
I would literally draw game levels

1200.66 --> 1205.52
I was a very nerdy kid like that

1203.47 --> 1206.78
[Music]

1205.52 --> 1209.36
okay

1206.78 --> 1211.6399999999999
but yeah then started drawing Maps then

1209.36 --> 1214.34
discovered Dungeons and Dragons type

1211.64 --> 1216.5
things and then really hit it off and

1214.34 --> 1219.3799999999999
started like drawing complicated game

1216.5 --> 1222.2
worlds and started to like craft in like

1219.38 --> 1225.679
I want this world to be realistic in a

1222.2 --> 1227.9
way like the nature there has to be

1225.679 --> 1230.6000000000001
realistic

1227.9 --> 1233.6200000000001
like it's not going to be as boring and

1230.6 --> 1233.62
complicated and

1234.08 --> 1239.84
and hard

1236.299 --> 1243.3799999999999
on the soul as the real world has to be

1239.84 --> 1245.6599999999999
necessarily but like how nature works

1243.38 --> 1247.7
even though it is a different world it's

1245.66 --> 1250.1000000000001
a different nature it has to like feel

1247.7 --> 1251.96
like this place could be real

1250.1 --> 1254.799
and it's always very important to me as

1251.96 --> 1254.799
a world designer

1257.84 --> 1263.74
and I always was asking questions too

1260.0 --> 1263.74
it's like why is this

1266.0 --> 1272.9
like why is South Africa such a weird

1269.84 --> 1275.86
climate compared to like

1272.9 --> 1275.8600000000001
the rest of the world

1277.28 --> 1281.8999999999999
and also just like these differences is

1279.559 --> 1285.26
like why does like summer and winter

1281.9 --> 1286.76
work so weirdly different

1285.26 --> 1290.78
like South

1286.76 --> 1294.08
like the South part of the

1290.78 --> 1297.1399999999999
equator compared to the north part like

1294.08 --> 1301.46
and nobody's ever been able to like

1297.14 --> 1303.7990000000002
explain that and I mean nobody ever

1301.46 --> 1306.14
like even smart people inform people

1303.799 --> 1308.24
like nobody really had a good answer for

1306.14 --> 1311.9
that they would just start rolling out

1308.24 --> 1313.88
their model and not actually answer it

1311.9 --> 1315.6200000000001
and I'm talking through like real life

1313.88 --> 1318.0200000000002
experiences and even Dark World like

1315.62 --> 1320.6589999999999
even in the Dark World nobody freaking

1318.02 --> 1323.6589999999999
understood it

1320.659 --> 1326.179
it was just like the

1323.659 --> 1328.22
the farthest I got was like figuring out

1326.179 --> 1330.38
like hey the celestial mechanics that

1328.22 --> 1331.94
it's like a device in the sixth

1330.38 --> 1334.7600000000002
dimension

1331.94 --> 1336.02
and then like it's separated it's like a

1334.76 --> 1338.299
hologram

1336.02 --> 1342.799
so it's not like objects in the physical

1338.299 --> 1345.26
world it's like here I go objects in the

1342.799 --> 1348.26
fourth dimension projected force from

1345.26 --> 1350.0
the device the celestial mechanism in

1348.26 --> 1352.52
the sixth dimension

1350.0 --> 1354.44
it's just a mechanism there

1352.52 --> 1356.9
and in the fourth dimension it results

1354.44 --> 1360.2
in like a hologram projection that would

1356.9 --> 1362.419
have like euclidean location in relation

1360.2 --> 1364.7
to everything but then in the third

1362.419 --> 1367.6000000000001
dimension it doesn't it is literally a

1364.7 --> 1367.6000000000001
non-local hologram

1368.36 --> 1373.58
[Music]

1371.14 --> 1375.38
and now that you heard that you're

1373.58 --> 1377.36
probably not surprised that I don't

1375.38 --> 1379.46
bring this up because

1377.36 --> 1381.0
this is the moment where all of the FED

1379.46 --> 1382.1200000000001
guys all goes

1381.0 --> 1386.9
[Applause]

1382.12 --> 1388.6999999999998
all total nonsense oh ridiculous yeah

1386.9 --> 1391.0590000000002
yeah that's why I typically don't bring

1388.7 --> 1391.059
that up

1391.4 --> 1395.5
because it is so freaking ethereal

1395.84 --> 1400.34
it's a little out there I know

1398.36 --> 1402.6399999999999
but I mean yeah I've experienced all

1400.34 --> 1406.22
these different dimensions and

1402.64 --> 1408.74
catalog them and like

1406.22 --> 1410.9
there are some things that I figured out

1408.74 --> 1414.559
can be explained

1410.9 --> 1417.5
even though not very solidly

1414.559 --> 1422.32
through the derivatives of of my

1417.5 --> 1422.32
exploits and that was one of them

1430.22 --> 1432.52
what

1433.64 --> 1441.14
South Poles have common

1436.88 --> 1443.48
different climates best iffy proof ever

1441.14 --> 1445.64
nah

1443.48 --> 1446.96
they've always had different climates so

1445.64 --> 1448.64
you can start water

1446.96 --> 1452.1200000000001
I always did

1448.64 --> 1454.5200000000002
but I do think they are in a way polls

1452.12 --> 1457.299
polarized and synchronized so if there

1454.52 --> 1459.559
is like weird anomalies that they will

1457.299 --> 1461.96
symmetrically mirror themselves so if

1459.559 --> 1464.96
there's like a band

1461.96 --> 1467.78
like there is there is a band where it's

1464.96 --> 1469.46
a little warmer right in the north it's

1467.78 --> 1471.3799999999999
like super cold super cold and then

1469.46 --> 1473.179
there's a bit like oh it's well it's

1471.38 --> 1475.46
almost moderate for a bit and then it

1473.179 --> 1478.46
gets super cold again that's there in

1475.46 --> 1479.78
the north well I think that that is also

1478.46 --> 1482.6000000000001
in the south

1479.78 --> 1485.86
and actually that might be like South

1482.6 --> 1488.299
Africa that might be right on that point

1485.86 --> 1491.9599999999998
after like

1488.299 --> 1493.94
compare it though on the map like the

1491.96 --> 1495.74
the degree

1493.94 --> 1497.48
is that the case

1495.74 --> 1499.58
because it would make a lot of sense

1497.48 --> 1501.679
right so but if there is some kind of

1499.58 --> 1505.58
shift over it gets like super warm there

1501.679 --> 1507.919
for some reason then that should mirror

1505.58 --> 1510.3999999999999
itself on the other side of the Equator

1507.919 --> 1510.4
as well

1513.679 --> 1516.3400000000001
wow

1517.58 --> 1524.48
it's like the influence is symmetrical

1520.94 --> 1526.64
but because the landscape is not

1524.48 --> 1528.679
symmetrical

1526.64 --> 1530.539
from the equator right North and South

1528.679 --> 1533.0
that's not symmetrical there's different

1530.539 --> 1535.82
shapes and that's why

1533.0 --> 1538.94
that symmetrical influence Celestial

1535.82 --> 1542.1789999999999
influence most likely celestial

1538.94 --> 1544.159
is Express manifesting differently

1542.179 --> 1548.14
because the landscape is differently

1544.159 --> 1548.14
making it asymmetrical somewhat

1552.62 --> 1554.62
um

1559.4 --> 1562.48
what do you guys think

1562.52 --> 1565.24
hey doctor

1566.9 --> 1571.179
dude look you're getting a ranch low

1568.94 --> 1571.179
fruit

1585.26 --> 1589.24
it's like you were always one of the

1587.059 --> 1589.24
guys

1591.74 --> 1595.46
and it was kind of from the beginning

1593.299 --> 1596.96
but I mean just because I get that on an

1595.46 --> 1599.3600000000001
Impulse it doesn't mean that you can

1596.96 --> 1602.6200000000001
just get a wrench because of the impulse

1599.36 --> 1602.62
because I've been wrong before

1603.44 --> 1609.5
yeah but you definitely deserve that

1606.62 --> 1611.2399999999998
like sensible even like subjects that

1609.5 --> 1613.279
I'm talking about getting a response

1611.24 --> 1615.5
that'll definitely

1613.279 --> 1617.24
give you a lot of credit because I'm

1615.5 --> 1619.7
kind of desperate for people that are

1617.24 --> 1621.799
like actually following what I'm saying

1619.7 --> 1623.24
and I understand that it can be very

1621.799 --> 1625.94
difficult

1623.24 --> 1628.52
if only I have even more sympathy for

1625.94 --> 1631.039
that effect because well that kind of

1628.52 --> 1633.02
partially also happened with me with

1631.039 --> 1635.6589999999999
Darth the other day

1633.02 --> 1638.0
when it's somebody else beside myself

1635.659 --> 1640.279
that is actually explaining complicated

1638.0 --> 1642.679
things even though I am doing it it's

1640.279 --> 1644.659
yeah when you have to like decode

1642.679 --> 1646.7
somebody doing that

1644.659 --> 1648.8600000000001
that's a little bit more difficult than

1646.7 --> 1652.419
just letting it happen because you're

1648.86 --> 1652.4189999999999
the one rolling it out

1653.779 --> 1661.1
and of course Darth is not super trained

1656.36 --> 1663.26
in being explicable as what I have done

1661.1 --> 1665.12
but that's completely logical I mean

1663.26 --> 1667.4
it's his first appearance it's already

1665.12 --> 1670.299
his performance level was great he was

1667.4 --> 1670.299
very explicable

1671.779 --> 1678.58
for a first appearance that was like

1674.179 --> 1678.5800000000002
really good in that sense so

1679.94 --> 1684.919
much better than my first appearance

1683.059 --> 1687.98
then again I didn't really have somebody

1684.919 --> 1690.38
to really guide me into it too

1687.98 --> 1692.679
what

1690.38 --> 1692.679
no

1694.94 --> 1702.919
because even Nathan wasn't all that

1699.26 --> 1704.779
like we they was also fresh and Patricia

1702.919 --> 1707.24
though but I mean I went like on

1704.779 --> 1708.98
Patricia's show when I was already like

1707.24 --> 1711.26
doing my own thing

1708.98 --> 1715.3600000000001
but that person was in a way like a

1711.26 --> 1715.36
moral guidance for us all at the time

1716.0 --> 1720.26
it really was it's just something that

1718.159 --> 1722.9
just was there it's just a spirit thing

1720.26 --> 1727.1589999999999
I don't know why it's just she had this

1722.9 --> 1730.3600000000001
this care and it really was palpable and

1727.159 --> 1730.3600000000001
very motivating

1730.82 --> 1733.6
but yeah

1733.94 --> 1738.5
I think Darth could be very interesting

1736.82 --> 1740.299
person on YouTube

1738.5 --> 1744.22
if he chooses to

1740.299 --> 1744.22
he's got a lot to work through though

1745.279 --> 1750.44
It's gotta find a good

1747.98 --> 1753.08
a good place for his nerd syndrome

1750.44 --> 1755.9
because he does have that I recognize it

1753.08 --> 1759.6789999999999
and I highly sympathize

1755.9 --> 1762.02
because like I actually appreciate that

1759.679 --> 1763.52
he still has like these heavy modesty

1762.02 --> 1767.0
reflexes

1763.52 --> 1768.98
which is a great habit it's a

1767.0 --> 1771.26
I used to do that all the time but then

1768.98 --> 1775.24
I kind of like recently chose to like

1771.26 --> 1775.24
yeah I'm gonna just

1775.76 --> 1782.12
I'm just gonna own it now

1779.299 --> 1785.12
I'm gonna stop being modest

1782.12 --> 1788.0
unless I know

1785.12 --> 1790.58
it would be wiser to do that

1788.0 --> 1793.34
because it's something that I can like

1790.58 --> 1795.799
palpably prove

1793.34 --> 1797.48
I am not a master at because I'm not a

1795.799 --> 1800.26
master at any everything

1797.48 --> 1800.26
you know

1807.32 --> 1814.76
just confidence

1810.76 --> 1814.76
self-reflection explicability

1817.039 --> 1821.96
those are my main focuses

1820.53 --> 1824.62
[Music]

1821.96 --> 1824.6200000000001
all right anyway

1824.72 --> 1829.96
right

1826.88 --> 1829.96
I love this chat

1830.32 --> 1837.1399999999999
isn't this chat just so much cleaner

1833.659 --> 1839.72
than say flat swords or even feds

1837.14 --> 1842.779
isn't it

1839.72 --> 1845.8990000000001
I mean yeah we get the the occasional

1842.779 --> 1848.86
like drive-by shootings from trolls in

1845.899 --> 1848.86
the chat and all that

1849.2 --> 1854.3600000000001
like all these suicide bombing soccer

1853.22 --> 1856.7
counts

1854.36 --> 1858.9189999999999
but I mean

1856.7 --> 1861.74
like we got good roof snipers and all

1858.919 --> 1863.179
that and they don't have a chance really

1861.74 --> 1866.179
it's like

1863.179 --> 1869.0
my chat is like a little Switzerland

1866.179 --> 1872.0
we all got ranches right most of us do

1869.0 --> 1875.059
it's not everybody but like if you're

1872.0 --> 1876.679
like slightly unreliable then you

1875.059 --> 1878.36
probably wouldn't have a Rancher like if

1876.679 --> 1881.299
you're not in control of your machine

1878.36 --> 1882.9799999999998
and and constant pocket Banning [ __ ] or

1881.299 --> 1884.4189999999999
your kid gets a hold of it all the time

1882.98 --> 1886.52
yeah then you're not gonna have a wrench

1884.419 --> 1888.0800000000002
but most have a wrenches it's like a

1886.52 --> 1891.7
civil Duty because

1888.08 --> 1895.22
our little tiny little internet chat

1891.7 --> 1898.1000000000001
Nation sort of thing is continually

1895.22 --> 1901.88
getting hit from the outside by

1898.1 --> 1904.58
like Marxist Anarchist or whatever

1901.88 --> 1907.3400000000001
crazy people

1904.58 --> 1909.98
that don't like our culture

1907.34 --> 1911.4189999999999
and so we're all ready to like on a

1909.98 --> 1913.279
moment's note it's just oh here's one

1911.419 --> 1914.8990000000001
again

1913.279 --> 1916.76
gone

1914.899 --> 1920.4799999999998
because we know exactly where to shoot

1916.76 --> 1923.24
we've had that happen so many times

1920.48 --> 1925.52
like we have a we have an industrial

1923.24 --> 1927.38
efficiency for dealing with that at this

1925.52 --> 1931.179
point

1927.38 --> 1931.179
yeah best chat to start today

1931.419 --> 1936.6200000000001
like actually clean where everybody that

1935.36 --> 1939.62
comes there

1936.62 --> 1943.6999999999998
cleans up their own mess

1939.62 --> 1947.1789999999999
do you remember those time those days

1943.7 --> 1949.3400000000001
where like you're with the community

1947.179 --> 1951.14
and like everybody cleans up their own

1949.34 --> 1953.1789999999999
mess you'll go picnicking and everybody

1951.14 --> 1955.5800000000002
like literally goes looking in the grass

1953.179 --> 1958.22
if they didn't like leave a little piece

1955.58 --> 1961.82
of paper or something I'd be epic

1958.22 --> 1965.419
and that's what I feel with this chat

1961.82 --> 1967.56
and it's awesome it's very

1965.419 --> 1970.8990000000001
morally stabilizing

1967.56 --> 1974.26
[Music]

1970.899 --> 1974.26
I love it

1975.159 --> 1981.3200000000002
it's the one thing really that

1978.14 --> 1983.96
that like keeps me

1981.32 --> 1985.22
prevents me from moving on too like

1983.96 --> 1987.08
because there's other things that I

1985.22 --> 1989.72
could potentially do

1987.08 --> 1993.1589999999999
but I mean I really like this I I like

1989.72 --> 1993.159
that how this has formed

1995.679 --> 2001.72
I'm proud of it

1997.88 --> 2005.98
and I'm like very hopeful and

2001.72 --> 2009.039
that all of you guys also are just like

2005.98 --> 2011.5
taking advantage

2009.039 --> 2013.539
taking advantage of this thing that we

2011.5 --> 2015.399
have

2013.539 --> 2018.1589999999999
and that you like

2015.399 --> 2019.899
there to like get to know one another

2018.159 --> 2023.2
even better

2019.899 --> 2025.9599999999998
like I actually try to because most of

2023.2 --> 2028.659
you guys are like in the US and like it

2025.96 --> 2031.659
would be very cool if you guys like

2028.659 --> 2035.3990000000001
really became like personal like like we

2031.659 --> 2035.3990000000001
could really be a more tight Club

2035.919 --> 2040.1200000000001
right because

2037.72 --> 2042.519
we all went through the vetting process

2040.12 --> 2045.899
which is this check right it is a

2042.519 --> 2045.8990000000001
vetting process in a way

2046.84 --> 2052.899
and the longer you're there the more you

2049.179 --> 2055.839
just like become like

2052.899 --> 2057.7599999999998
yeah you get it more

2055.839 --> 2060.82
and that's something that you can rely

2057.76 --> 2063.28
on even I think to a degree it would

2060.82 --> 2067.32
have to like figure that out

2063.28 --> 2067.32
Beyond just this show in the chat

2068.26 --> 2073.659
I uphold this beyond the show in the

2070.72 --> 2076.2
chat too except well on the show I have

2073.659 --> 2078.099
authority so I can like really just

2076.2 --> 2080.02
enforce that

2078.099 --> 2082.3590000000004
outside of the show I can't really

2080.02 --> 2084.879
enforce that I can only like try to

2082.359 --> 2088.5989999999997
advertise for like there is a there we

2084.879 --> 2091.419
can make a better world kind of thing

2088.599 --> 2094.179
but by example and by showing how things

2091.419 --> 2097.18
can be fixed that really impresses

2094.179 --> 2099.64
people when you can explicably tell how

2097.18 --> 2101.7999999999997
things that our typical burden can be

2099.64 --> 2103.68
fixed and that they certainly feel it in

2101.8 --> 2107.0800000000004
their grasp that's like

2103.68 --> 2109.44
enormously morally restoring

2107.08 --> 2112.119
because no almost Nobody Does that

2109.44 --> 2115.599
everybody's like used to like moping and

2112.119 --> 2117.7200000000003
oh another shitty thing happened and

2115.599 --> 2121.42
it's like dude

2117.72 --> 2123.2799999999997
why aren't you trying to figure a way

2121.42 --> 2125.98
through it's like oh another challenge

2123.28 --> 2128.32
another pile of [ __ ] how can we

2125.98 --> 2130.0
fermentize this [ __ ] and like turn it

2128.32 --> 2132.52
into great compost as quickly as

2130.0 --> 2134.88
possible and then be thankful to God for

2132.52 --> 2134.88
the gift

2134.98 --> 2141.16
yeah that's that's what I like

2138.18 --> 2144.18
it's I learned that in a way from the

2141.16 --> 2144.18
culture of the Mormons

2145.48 --> 2152.32
it's like take the hyper-constructive

2149.619 --> 2155.8
positive find a way through attitude of

2152.32 --> 2159.3590000000004
the Mormons combine it with Hyper

2155.8 --> 2159.3590000000004
mechanical intelligence

2160.839 --> 2166.599
and then

2162.7 --> 2169.359
take off the Dogma clams the things that

2166.599 --> 2172.3
are nonsensical the illogic take the

2169.359 --> 2174.2799999999997
illogical teachings from Mormonism and

2172.3 --> 2177.46
Christianity take it off

2174.28 --> 2178.98
take the Mormon social culture

2177.46 --> 2182.7400000000002
and then

2178.98 --> 2185.02
enforce intelligence make it even more

2182.74 --> 2188.7999999999997
debating

2185.02 --> 2190.599
intelligent like we all train each other

2188.8 --> 2191.92
like that like it's an attitude it's

2190.599 --> 2195.2200000000003
like a duty

2191.92 --> 2197.7000000000003
to make sure the others don't slip down

2195.22 --> 2197.7
right

2198.16 --> 2203.44
and I think that would that's like the

2200.32 --> 2206.079
perfect combination you got great

2203.44 --> 2209.579
positivity you got great intelligence

2206.079 --> 2209.579
and nothing to hold you down

2211.3 --> 2216.76
this is our winian culture it's probably

2214.66 --> 2219.5789999999997
not a good name for it but

2216.76 --> 2222.3390000000004
that's my vision that's what I've been

2219.579 --> 2225.76
trying to personify for a while

2222.339 --> 2228.24
I mean I went and gone from the

2225.76 --> 2233.98
government church but I mean their power

2228.24 --> 2237.8199999999997
is palpable they did actually save me

2233.98 --> 2240.099
I was having hallucinations like seeing

2237.82 --> 2241.0
things from the Dark World in the

2240.099 --> 2243.54
streets

2241.0 --> 2243.54
like

2243.88 --> 2250.48
totally totally like sweating scared

2248.5 --> 2252.64
and like went to them like and they did

2250.48 --> 2255.16
a lay on hands on me and like blessed me

2252.64 --> 2257.2
and like it did actually change

2255.16 --> 2260.02
everything

2257.2 --> 2262.18
and then like I got I wasn't afraid of

2260.02 --> 2264.16
them because I just thought like oh it's

2262.18 --> 2266.2599999999998
just more Christians

2264.16 --> 2268.8999999999996
but they're really different from a lot

2266.26 --> 2270.94
of other Christians because they focus

2268.9 --> 2273.52
just more on that

2270.94 --> 2275.079
positive creativity with the families

2273.52 --> 2277.24
like all these families have like

2275.079 --> 2279.2200000000003
creative

2277.24 --> 2281.3199999999997
activity

2279.22 --> 2283.7799999999997
they play music

2281.32 --> 2285.76
and that already like playing music is

2283.78 --> 2289.8
like whoa that's what my mother used to

2285.76 --> 2289.8
do with that's what we used to do

2290.619 --> 2295.9
so there's a real appeal from a lot of

2293.56 --> 2298.42
like Mormon culture to me

2295.9 --> 2300.4
the problem now is that I've never

2298.42 --> 2304.619
really been able to find people in there

2300.4 --> 2304.619
that were like hyper intelligent

2306.16 --> 2311.3199999999997
I've tested it a bunch and like all of

2308.44 --> 2313.359
them eventually would be like I don't

2311.32 --> 2314.44
understand I'm gonna just appeal to my

2313.359 --> 2316.72
Dogma

2314.44 --> 2321.339
they would not be mean about it though

2316.72 --> 2325.1189999999997
always polite they were never mean to me

2321.339 --> 2327.66
for venturing outside of territory that

2325.119 --> 2327.6600000000003
they could understand

2334.359 --> 2338.859
right and not like passive aggressive

2336.4 --> 2340.599
not like oh I can't be mean about it but

2338.859 --> 2344.56
I'm like holding a grudge you know they

2340.599 --> 2346.06
would generally genuine genuinely

2344.56 --> 2348.64
not do that

2346.06 --> 2351.9
I was very impressed

2348.64 --> 2351.9
hey Stevie Traveler

2352.18 --> 2355.0789999999997
oh

2362.38 --> 2367.6600000000003
oh God talking about masks I saw some

2365.079 --> 2372.1600000000003
guy yesterday wearing one

2367.66 --> 2374.3799999999997
and it like literally looked like a baby

2372.16 --> 2378.7
like a baby print

2374.38 --> 2381.33
baby clothes print themed mask like on a

2378.7 --> 2384.3889999999997
guy that was clearly a dog and I'm like

2381.33 --> 2384.389
[Music]

2386.5 --> 2391.48
pick that off

2388.72 --> 2394.0
but then

2391.48 --> 2396.4
then I'd probably get like in a hassle

2394.0 --> 2400.8
and [ __ ] because he's probably like a

2396.4 --> 2400.8
[ __ ] sjw from the look of it

2400.839 --> 2405.82
but uh yeah

2403.06 --> 2407.38
it's a couple of freaks

2405.82 --> 2410.8590000000004
there's freaks

2407.38 --> 2413.98
roaming around they're all

2410.859 --> 2417.22
these environment environmentalist

2413.98 --> 2419.56
man-made climate change crazies like the

2417.22 --> 2423.04
man-made climate change crazies are now

2419.56 --> 2425.7999999999997
dominating over the original

2423.04 --> 2428.619
premise of sjw

2425.8 --> 2430.599
it's like that side that part of the

2428.619 --> 2432.099
delusion you have the sjw illusion you

2430.599 --> 2434.44
had the climate change delusion the

2432.099 --> 2438.099
climate change delusion is basically now

2434.44 --> 2441.46
all growing the sjw illusion

2438.099 --> 2443.6800000000003
why because it's more overt total

2441.46 --> 2446.52
Destruction

2443.68 --> 2446.52
it's worse

2447.28 --> 2452.02
it's moreover and that's happening they

2449.98 --> 2455.52
are out there and all of them are are

2452.02 --> 2458.2599999999998
crazy it's like they're all like

2455.52 --> 2460.78
provably clinical but for some reason

2458.26 --> 2463.9
they are now

2460.78 --> 2466.8390000000004
not they're not being

2463.9 --> 2468.52
isolated as not that they rule you have

2466.839 --> 2470.2599999999998
to put them in a cloud of room necessary

2468.52 --> 2473.44
but they're not like addressed on it

2470.26 --> 2475.6600000000003
anymore like no you are approvably wrong

2473.44 --> 2477.94
and that is a bit worrisome

2475.66 --> 2480.2799999999997
but on the other hand I mean people are

2477.94 --> 2483.46
everywhere are saturated with like crazy

2480.28 --> 2485.44
situations that eventually being

2483.46 --> 2487.2400000000002
presented with enough situations that

2485.44 --> 2488.859
you can't do anything about you will

2487.24 --> 2490.24
stop doing about the things that you

2488.859 --> 2492.5789999999997
could do something about

2490.24 --> 2495.2799999999997
that's an unfortunate effect of

2492.579 --> 2497.8590000000004
overexposure to social media too and

2495.28 --> 2499.96
news it was always the original problem

2497.859 --> 2503.02
with news right because what did they do

2499.96 --> 2506.079
with the original news even in the 90s

2503.02 --> 2507.7
give you a lot of [ __ ] bad news what

2506.079 --> 2510.28
could you do about it barely anything

2507.7 --> 2512.7999999999997
maybe send money to some fund or

2510.28 --> 2515.02
something right that's it

2512.8 --> 2517.0
and then a lot of it even was a scam

2515.02 --> 2519.82
afterward and nobody would admit it and

2517.0 --> 2522.7
[ __ ] and it's just a mess but like

2519.82 --> 2525.88
giving you a lot of bad news

2522.7 --> 2527.6189999999997
you end up like knowing caring about

2525.88 --> 2529.859
things that you can't do anything about

2527.619 --> 2533.859
when you do that

2529.859 --> 2535.5989999999997
you also then start to like ignore

2533.859 --> 2538.14
things that you potentially could do

2535.599 --> 2538.1400000000003
something about

2539.44 --> 2543.7000000000003
and that's a real big that's a universal

2542.02 --> 2546.599
problem with all forms of media

2543.7 --> 2546.5989999999997
including television

2547.96 --> 2555.18
and I think that that factor is very

2550.54 --> 2555.18
contributing to people basically not

2555.94 --> 2559.359
exerting peer pressure about the right

2558.339 --> 2561.7
things

2559.359 --> 2564.16
it's like the the whole [ __ ] virtue

2561.7 --> 2566.98
signaling like oh you're

2564.16 --> 2569.52
you're like homophobic and that's evil

2566.98 --> 2573.339
or you're a Nazi that sort of stuff

2569.52 --> 2575.5
that's like taking up that frequency and

2573.339 --> 2577.54
now that's the only thing people still

2575.5 --> 2579.099
do with that frequency there's no more

2577.54 --> 2582.4
intense Shame about anything else

2579.099 --> 2584.8
because that thing is like

2582.4 --> 2587.76
like gotten in there like a yeah well

2584.8 --> 2591.3390000000004
like a cancer metaphorically

2587.76 --> 2595.7400000000002
not a good analogy with what I know

2591.339 --> 2599.619
about cancer really but still it's like

2595.74 --> 2603.0989999999997
it's stolen the frequency where is the

2599.619 --> 2604.48
like hey don't do that that's wrong

2603.099 --> 2606.7000000000003
where's it gone

2604.48 --> 2610.06
publicly

2606.7 --> 2613.3799999999997
public outcry about indecencies

2610.06 --> 2613.38
where is it

2617.56 --> 2624.5789999999997
it's like the sjws just stole it

2621.76 --> 2627.0600000000004
and now everybody's just afraid to to do

2624.579 --> 2627.0600000000004
that anymore

2628.66 --> 2633.46
virtue mining that's an interesting one

2631.24 --> 2636.3999999999996
they are digging for

2633.46 --> 2640.38
virtue mining is actually a better way

2636.4 --> 2640.38
to say it yeah a good one is she

2641.2 --> 2646.02
right but everybody knows it is like

2643.06 --> 2646.02
virtual signaling

2649.18 --> 2653.52
hey lumpy gas in a vacuum good to see

2651.4 --> 2653.52
you

2668.2 --> 2672.3999999999996
all right but virtue mining is like

2670.78 --> 2674.8590000000004
different from virtue signaling when you

2672.4 --> 2676.6600000000003
think about it because virtue singer is

2674.859 --> 2678.4
just one moment it's just like oh yeah

2676.66 --> 2680.5
I'm not threatening

2678.4 --> 2682.96
and then like yeah [ __ ] it I'm just

2680.5 --> 2685.0
doing it my way right that would be a

2682.96 --> 2688.06
virtual signaling while virtue mining is

2685.0 --> 2690.04
like no I didn't really like this and

2688.06 --> 2693.22
I'm gonna apply it and everything I do

2690.04 --> 2695.8
like that's like virtue mining it's like

2693.22 --> 2699.04
you completely you just

2695.8 --> 2700.78
get covered in in Gross virtue because

2699.04 --> 2703.599
of the binding

2700.78 --> 2707.26
like coals you're just all blackened up

2703.599 --> 2710.94
with virtue oh gross

2707.26 --> 2710.94
that would be virtue mining

2714.04 --> 2720.839
taken cannot eat

2716.68 --> 2720.839
that's really cool I like that say

2735.94 --> 2743.14
people alone in their car wearing mat

2738.46 --> 2745.66
you find that humorous steamy Traveler

2743.14 --> 2747.94
sorry to say but I that I find it a bit

2745.66 --> 2750.64
creep a bit of a creeper though

2747.94 --> 2752.319
do you have that tendency I mean I like

2750.64 --> 2754.359
you dude but

2752.319 --> 2757.66
it's I don't think that's funny at all

2754.359 --> 2759.64
when I see that I'm just like oh no

2757.66 --> 2762.7
oh my God

2759.64 --> 2764.98
it's like idiocracy is just staring you

2762.7 --> 2766.8999999999996
in the face it's like hey hey you're

2764.98 --> 2771.28
trying to fix everything well guess up

2766.9 --> 2774.099
guess what idiocracy is is there

2771.28 --> 2776.6800000000003
it's like retardation is trying to

2774.099 --> 2778.3590000000004
replicate itself like infect others

2776.68 --> 2780.8799999999997
spiritually so that they also become

2778.359 --> 2783.7
[ __ ] because when you see people

2780.88 --> 2785.7400000000002
that are [ __ ] enough that like makes

2783.7 --> 2788.02
a little devil and some people come out

2785.74 --> 2789.64
when they're very stressed out about how

2788.02 --> 2791.859
the pressures in their life and all the

2789.64 --> 2794.859
responsibility and that devil tells them

2791.859 --> 2797.14
like well

2794.859 --> 2799.54
if they're that [ __ ] then why would

2797.14 --> 2801.7
you have to make all that effort yeah

2799.54 --> 2802.7799999999997
and some people actually let themselves

2801.7 --> 2806.4399999999996
slip

2802.78 --> 2809.5600000000004
because of how [ __ ] other people act

2806.44 --> 2811.42
yeah and that's the spreading

2809.56 --> 2813.94
of Idiocracy

2811.42 --> 2817.98
I don't find it funny personally

2813.94 --> 2817.98
like I never like joke about that

2818.2 --> 2822.64
except well when I'm on a roll maybe

2820.66 --> 2824.68
then in between anywhere but I don't

2822.64 --> 2827.44
actually like in the world laugh I'd

2824.68 --> 2830.2599999999998
always like oh no the freaking idiocracy

2827.44 --> 2832.3
how how am I gonna cure this that's what

2830.26 --> 2834.8390000000004
I think it's just like how how can I

2832.3 --> 2834.8390000000004
cure this

2835.26 --> 2842.28
how can I prevent this mental illness

2837.88 --> 2842.28
from spreading that's what I feel

2846.88 --> 2851.28
but uh yeah

2849.52 --> 2854.319
okay

2851.28 --> 2856.0
didn't mean to get give a dig at you

2854.319 --> 2856.96
there see me traveler don't worry about

2856.0 --> 2859.42
it

2856.96 --> 2861.46
It's just sometimes you I find that you

2859.42 --> 2863.5
have a bit of a weird tone and I feel

2861.46 --> 2865.54
like you don't see it

2863.5 --> 2867.04
it's definitely not something that you

2865.54 --> 2870.64
intend

2867.04 --> 2873.24
so don't worry still one of my favorite

2870.64 --> 2873.24
followers

2878.44 --> 2882.46
yeah

2880.9 --> 2884.38
not wanting to wear a mask yeah

2882.46 --> 2886.359
worrisome

2884.38 --> 2889.359
for me it's a sign of mental illness

2886.359 --> 2892.72
especially when it's dude he was wearing

2889.359 --> 2895.0
the mask in that freaking like 31 degree

2892.72 --> 2898.54
heat okay

2895.0 --> 2901.48
like outside with the Sun hitting him

2898.54 --> 2903.22
and then he stands there with like

2901.48 --> 2905.94
dude

2903.22 --> 2905.9399999999996
dude

2907.9 --> 2913.54
but he wasn't even there

2910.66 --> 2916.48
he was acting weird too he was not like

2913.54 --> 2919.359
he maybe he did I kind of sort of feel

2916.48 --> 2920.2
ashamed about it it's just so bizarre

2919.359 --> 2923.859
because

2920.2 --> 2925.18
foreign didn't seem communicatable at

2923.859 --> 2927.339
all

2925.18 --> 2929.14
from just what I felt and it's not like

2927.339 --> 2930.64
I just hung around for a minute and

2929.14 --> 2932.92
stared at him but

2930.64 --> 2935.56
I mean I get a lot of impressions in

2932.92 --> 2938.2200000000003
just a few seconds a spiritual metadata

2935.56 --> 2938.22
that they work with

2942.099 --> 2948.6600000000003
watching mosquitoes with fishing net

2944.74 --> 2948.66
yeah that's not very useful

2953.38 --> 2959.38
right anyway I'm gonna take a bite out

2956.98 --> 2962.339
of this cheers

2959.38 --> 2962.339
good

2962.52 --> 2965.63
[Music]

2988.48 --> 2990.54
um

2990.819 --> 2997.319
no cringe today what

2994.72 --> 2997.319
foreign

3007.5 --> 3012.02
you didn't think that sounded crunchy

3009.66 --> 3012.02
did you

3016.859 --> 3019.14
what

3017.66 --> 3022.68
[Music]

3019.14 --> 3026.06
you hear a massive crunch well

3022.68 --> 3026.06
it's cooled down a bit

3026.7 --> 3033.3799999999997
so a massive crunch well maybe I can do

3030.359 --> 3033.38
that let's see

3034.819 --> 3038.24
is that better

3041.67 --> 3044.82
[Music]

3054.78 --> 3058.94
yeah the tips are always very crunchy

3068.46 --> 3071.18
hmm

3081.119 --> 3086.76
wow

3082.68 --> 3090.7799999999997
okay the clouds have now covered the sky

3086.76 --> 3094.079
they could probably cooled off in a bit

3090.78 --> 3096.07
chickens are going wild

3094.079 --> 3100.1490000000003
do you hear that

3096.07 --> 3100.1490000000003
[Music]

3105.24 --> 3110.4599999999996
I wonder if they have been actually kept

3107.819 --> 3113.839
properly cool with the heat recently

3110.46 --> 3113.839
they're still alive but

3116.16 --> 3118.16
um

3118.52 --> 3122.72
but they're probably relieved

3124.98 --> 3127.4
okay

3130.38 --> 3136.7000000000003
are they wild no

3133.619 --> 3136.7000000000003
we're in a city

3137.4 --> 3143.94
there's no wild chickens in cities

3140.16 --> 3145.6189999999997
although there is a part in Utrecht

3143.94 --> 3147.7200000000003
where there's a park

3145.619 --> 3149.1600000000003
and they literally have wild chickens

3147.72 --> 3152.8799999999997
running well

3149.16 --> 3155.819
they weren't like native chickens but

3152.88 --> 3157.8
it's like chickens

3155.819 --> 3160.2599999999998
they just have chickens of all kinds

3157.8 --> 3162.059
there that literally like just run all

3160.26 --> 3163.7400000000002
over the place and they venture out out

3162.059 --> 3165.8390000000004
of the park too

3163.74 --> 3167.8799999999997
sometimes so sometimes like inner

3165.839 --> 3169.38
surrounding areas you could literally

3167.88 --> 3172.26
like walk in the streets and suddenly

3169.38 --> 3174.7200000000003
there's a chick in there hilarious

3172.26 --> 3177.7200000000003
yeah

3174.72 --> 3179.7
I love that I really like that

3177.72 --> 3182.0989999999997
and those chickens are like crushing it

3179.7 --> 3184.6189999999997
too because they are multiplying

3182.099 --> 3187.44
a lot

3184.619 --> 3190.619
so it's almost like a public Farm it's

3187.44 --> 3193.98
just that they just walk around eat

3190.619 --> 3196.26
stuff and whatever they can find it's

3193.98 --> 3198.54
not like they actively get food from

3196.26 --> 3200.28
like grain or something all those

3198.54 --> 3203.22
chickens in that Park literally like

3200.28 --> 3206.6600000000003
take care of themselves

3203.22 --> 3206.66
and there's hundreds of them

3206.94 --> 3210.839
if not a thousand or something I don't

3209.28 --> 3212.7000000000003
know exactly how much but there's a lot

3210.839 --> 3214.619
of chickens there

3212.7 --> 3217.5
I love it

3214.619 --> 3220.2200000000003
and hey it is also basically a backup

3217.5 --> 3220.22
food source

3223.22 --> 3227.9399999999996
but in this case you would actually have

3225.599 --> 3231.6800000000003
to find the eggs

3227.94 --> 3234.98
and probably fight off the mother

3231.68 --> 3234.98
to get him

3239.94 --> 3243.38
but I mean if like

3243.72 --> 3249.2999999999997
if farming got all [ __ ] up right and

3246.48 --> 3251.4
it's like just impossible and they all

3249.3 --> 3254.4
get like attacked or something with SWAT

3251.4 --> 3257.04
teams or something [ __ ] up

3254.4 --> 3258.9
well then after that's over and all

3257.04 --> 3260.94
those chickens were exterminated because

3258.9 --> 3263.04
the government's just [ __ ] up

3260.94 --> 3265.7400000000002
right

3263.04 --> 3268.7
well if they wanted to restart we got

3265.74 --> 3268.7
some chickens here

3269.579 --> 3273.44
that have like survived on their own

3275.64 --> 3282.42
so it is like a potentially a startup

3278.16 --> 3285.2599999999998
source for new Farms

3282.42 --> 3285.26
I like it

3288.19 --> 3292.92
[Music]

3290.46 --> 3295.68
maybe by the way they even like sell

3292.92 --> 3298.14
them like that maybe Farmers sometimes

3295.68 --> 3300.2999999999997
do combine it's like uh we would like a

3298.14 --> 3302.2799999999997
couple of these chickens

3300.3 --> 3304.02
and then here's a donation for the

3302.28 --> 3306.0
maintenance of the park maybe they

3304.02 --> 3308.599
already do that sort of thing that would

3306.0 --> 3308.599
be pretty cool

3315.18 --> 3319.9199999999996
that would be pretty smart

3317.54 --> 3323.0
I mean those chickens really do

3319.92 --> 3323.0
procreate a lot

3329.14 --> 3334.52
[Music]

3331.98 --> 3334.52
okay

3335.099 --> 3337.819
what

3344.099 --> 3346.1600000000003
um

3349.68 --> 3355.339
yeah hello turret

3351.74 --> 3355.339
306 gets you

3367.68 --> 3372.74
wow seeking star water that is really

3370.2 --> 3372.74
messed up

3373.38 --> 3376.579
how the hell did that happen

3392.28 --> 3396.7400000000002
but I mean that's gonna ruin the entire

3394.38 --> 3396.7400000000002
company

3397.559 --> 3400.52
very quickly

3402.78 --> 3408.3190000000004
because now nobody will want their

3405.54 --> 3408.319
product anymore

3412.32 --> 3417.6600000000003
[Music]

3415.38 --> 3420.6600000000003
after finding this out they're all

3417.66 --> 3422.5789999999997
literally all those safes are gonna go

3420.66 --> 3424.6189999999997
empty

3422.579 --> 3426.54
and they're gonna find a new safe that

3424.619 --> 3429.7400000000002
the government doesn't have access to

3426.54 --> 3429.74
this is ridiculous

3433.99 --> 3437.1899999999996
[Music]

3447.35 --> 3450.56
[Music]

3471.3 --> 3478.5
yeah so this Liberty Safeco taking star

3474.9 --> 3481.079
water what kind of company are they

3478.5 --> 3485.66
are they young old are they like an old

3481.079 --> 3485.6600000000003
American family company like what is it

3485.76 --> 3490.44
yeah

3488.099 --> 3491.52
is it a mega Corporation is like a black

3490.44 --> 3495.02
rock

3491.52 --> 3495.02
Corporation what is it

3497.4 --> 3499.64
foreign

3528.0 --> 3532.74
because this sounds almost like another

3529.799 --> 3534.42
like button wiser sellout

3532.74 --> 3536.4599999999996
where they're just like

3534.42 --> 3538.26
selling out in a terrible way that

3536.46 --> 3540.7200000000003
nobody agrees to and then their company

3538.26 --> 3544.2000000000003
literally gets ruined because of it it

3540.72 --> 3547.2599999999998
sounds like a Marxist sellout

3544.2 --> 3548.8799999999997
old company right that so that's

3547.26 --> 3551.2200000000003
terrible

3548.88 --> 3553.1400000000003
sounds like an old company just did a

3551.22 --> 3556.819
Marxist sellout

3553.14 --> 3556.819
that's really horrendous

3560.359 --> 3565.2599999999998
the owners are cursed

3562.92 --> 3566.579
for this like I don't need to do

3565.26 --> 3570.1400000000003
anything I'm just pointing it out like

3566.579 --> 3570.1400000000003
those owners are cursed for that

3574.88 --> 3580.319
I don't know why they did it are they

3577.44 --> 3582.2400000000002
blackmailed that did the government get

3580.319 --> 3584.359
in and threaten to kill them or

3582.24 --> 3584.359
something

3585.0 --> 3590.359
like I don't know why the hell you would

3586.859 --> 3590.359
ever do that then

3610.26 --> 3615.96
right but it's it's very

3613.44 --> 3619.52
think about it it's very

3615.96 --> 3619.52
communist Chinese

3619.68 --> 3624.0789999999997
right communist China Chinese

3624.66 --> 3629.7599999999998
that party

3626.099 --> 3631.98
their party the Republican Chinese party

3629.76 --> 3634.3190000000004
or whatever the [ __ ] that was called

3631.98 --> 3636.92
they have that with everything in China

3634.319 --> 3636.92
it's like

3637.319 --> 3644.4
they have access to everything

3640.28 --> 3647.46
like you cannot have a secret

3644.4 --> 3649.7400000000002
from their government the CCP right

3647.46 --> 3651.66
so if you have a vault and they want

3649.74 --> 3654.359
access to that fault you must give them

3651.66 --> 3656.16
access to that vault and that's well

3654.359 --> 3658.319
that's because yeah people don't

3656.16 --> 3660.24
actually have constitutional rights in

3658.319 --> 3663.44
China and it seems like they're trying

3660.24 --> 3663.4399999999996
to copy that effect

3669.599 --> 3674.579
they just want the excess of Kings which

3672.839 --> 3677.5789999999997
is what the Chinese do with their

3674.579 --> 3680.04
assistant Communist Party

3677.579 --> 3683.8390000000004
are like kings and they have like full

3680.04 --> 3683.839
out right to do whatever they want

3687.78 --> 3694.02
with other people

3690.0 --> 3696.98
and it seems like America or the Boyden

3694.02 --> 3696.98
regime whatever

3697.14 --> 3702.0499999999997
they're trying to like get that same

3699.54 --> 3705.139
place but through technocracy

3702.05 --> 3705.139
[Music]

3717.98 --> 3722.46
all right they get it not by literally

3721.319 --> 3727.2
like

3722.46 --> 3730.44
CCP like okay give it to us or die

3727.2 --> 3733.22
are they just blackmail or bribe it

3730.44 --> 3733.2200000000003
somehow

3733.38 --> 3738.1800000000003
to try and achieve the same thing

3735.9 --> 3740.6600000000003
so achieve the same thing without overt

3738.18 --> 3740.66
Force

3771.2 --> 3774.29
[Music]

3780.38 --> 3783.449
[Music]

3787.02 --> 3792.839
yeah that's actually newsworthy enough

3789.359 --> 3796.02
for me to put it in the title

3792.839 --> 3798.66
thank you for letting me know about that

3796.02 --> 3801.44
I mean that is like very significant

3798.66 --> 3801.44
that that's happened

3802.68 --> 3807.7799999999997
because of the

3804.599 --> 3811.7400000000002
this yeah the the privacy

3807.78 --> 3815.6600000000003
violation that it actually is it's a

3811.74 --> 3815.66
Monumental privacy violation

3815.7 --> 3818.48
out of nowhere

3852.54 --> 3856.099
yeah so thanks for the tip

3869.16 --> 3874.22
thank you

3871.26 --> 3874.2200000000003
foreign

3885.44 --> 3893.66

3898.14 --> 3902.94
well that people that are gonna watch

3899.88 --> 3907.1600000000003
this that they can click

3902.94 --> 3907.16
basically or in the comment section

3909.0 --> 3912.68
otherwise I'm just gonna have to

3916.619 --> 3919.88
Google it myself

3943.88 --> 3947.42
can't find it

3949.559 --> 3951.799
foreign

3961.68 --> 3964.7599999999998
I can't find it

3975.839 --> 3978.68
seeking

3979.02 --> 3984.9
what's your Source seeking

3982.28 --> 3987.2400000000002
I tried to search it it's completely

3984.9 --> 3990.92
impossible to find anything

3987.24 --> 3990.9199999999996
it's all other subjects

4006.64 --> 4011.5
can I please get a source seeking star

4009.26 --> 4011.5
water

4014.48 --> 4017.48
okay

4017.93 --> 4023.74
[Music]

4019.76 --> 4023.7400000000002
oh my God no

4062.0 --> 4065.079
what is this

4068.539 --> 4076.3390000000004
they provided FBI in excess code for

4072.98 --> 4078.079
j6 guns

4076.339 --> 4080.2599999999998
yeah that's all the [ __ ] that I'm

4078.079 --> 4080.26
getting

4084.619 --> 4088.76
oh

4085.76 --> 4092.2400000000002
okay this is a YouTube thing here

4088.76 --> 4094.42
Liberty's safe Under Fire I'll give my

4092.24 --> 4094.4199999999996
access

4094.64 --> 4100.5199999999995
to a legend January 6. oh so it's about

4098.239 --> 4103.58
that

4100.52 --> 4105.92
it's not just they get everything they

4103.58 --> 4108.94
gave them specific access

4105.92 --> 4108.9400000000005
because of that

4109.819 --> 4114.14
president has visited right so that's

4111.92 --> 4117.259
different then

4114.14 --> 4120.02
I mean still worrisome but I literally

4117.259 --> 4123.259
thought that like American Liberty like

4120.02 --> 4125.42
literally like here are the keys to

4123.259 --> 4128.48
government that can like even without

4125.42 --> 4130.64
our supervision just check any safe that

4128.48 --> 4132.5199999999995
we have I thought it was that I thought

4130.64 --> 4136.279
it was like a direct

4132.52 --> 4138.5
CCP Handover of control like thing an

4136.279 --> 4141.1
Empire taking over

4138.5 --> 4143.54
but I mean yeah they just like

4141.1 --> 4148.0
cooperated and gave the government what

4143.54 --> 4148.0
they wanted in relation to January 6.

4149.92 --> 4156.4400000000005
I mean it's still crazy it's still

4153.38 --> 4159.08
really bad but I thought it was like

4156.44 --> 4161.299
super maximum I guess it isn't super

4159.08 --> 4163.759
maximum good

4161.299 --> 4165.739
still worth worth putting it in the

4163.759 --> 4167.96
title

4165.739 --> 4170.178999999999
foreign

4167.96 --> 4172.699
they should absolutely get a huge

4170.179 --> 4175.219
backlash because of it

4172.699 --> 4176.419999999999
on the other hand yeah if the FBI comes

4175.219 --> 4180.259
in and just

4176.42 --> 4182.2390000000005
what the hell do you do you know

4180.259 --> 4183.799
that is a good question like if you're

4182.239 --> 4185.839
like oh

4183.799 --> 4188.06
we have safes that's our corporation

4185.839 --> 4190.04
that they're safe and the FBI comes

4188.06 --> 4193.279
rolling and what the hell do you do

4190.04 --> 4194.26
would be kind of Handy to actually have

4193.279 --> 4196.9400000000005
some

4194.26 --> 4199.46
preconceived notions on how to respond

4196.94 --> 4201.639999999999
to that like can you actually say no to

4199.46 --> 4201.64
them

4203.42 --> 4209.0
like how does that work would be really

4206.36 --> 4211.88
useful to know that

4209.0 --> 4214.46
it's like if the FBI comes rolling in

4211.88 --> 4217.52
it'd be good to know if you're like okay

4214.46 --> 4219.62
I'm gonna call my lawyer right now don't

4217.52 --> 4222.02
you [ __ ] dare do anything

4219.62 --> 4224.199
and then you advise it like what do we

4222.02 --> 4224.1990000000005
do

4251.48 --> 4254.48
foreign

4255.82 --> 4259.719
laws otherwise why would you

4260.239 --> 4265.4
right well that's if they were

4262.28 --> 4268.219
potentially like

4265.4 --> 4270.739
not super clean

4268.219 --> 4272.78
and that the FBI said oh we're going to

4270.739 --> 4274.58
investigate you now we're gonna throw

4272.78 --> 4275.96
the buck at you unless you cooperate

4274.58 --> 4278.0
yeah that could have happened I don't

4275.96 --> 4281.659
know man

4278.0 --> 4283.159
I don't really know how the FBI operates

4281.659 --> 4286.219
yeah

4283.159 --> 4288.08
because I'm pretty sure that how it goes

4286.219 --> 4289.04
in the movies is not exactly how that

4288.08 --> 4291.76
works

4289.04 --> 4291.76
on average

4292.159 --> 4296.08
or maybe it is I don't know man

4308.56 --> 4315.7390000000005
locks only keep honest people out yeah

4312.26 --> 4318.64
damn at least you're on a roll today

4315.739 --> 4318.639999999999
totally true

4318.739 --> 4321.5199999999995
foreign

4330.76 --> 4336.08
on the other hand a good safe should

4333.92 --> 4338.86
keep everybody out that's the whole

4336.08 --> 4338.86
point of the safe

4346.04 --> 4349.94
can you show her older will be angry

4347.9 --> 4352.639999999999
very

4349.94 --> 4356.599999999999
low fruit very I mean it does almost

4352.64 --> 4359.54
feel like an Anheuser bush

4356.6 --> 4362.2390000000005
scenario

4359.54 --> 4365.96
it was again with the stupid beer [ __ ]

4362.239 --> 4368.0
cut Edwards like everybody was like [ __ ]

4365.96 --> 4371.06
you

4368.0 --> 4374.36
and the shareholders of American Liberty

4371.06 --> 4378.280000000001
are gonna be [ __ ] you you told us you

4374.36 --> 4378.28
would be no you wouldn't do that

4380.0 --> 4383.84
that's like in the contract that you

4381.92 --> 4385.34
would never do that you bastards

4383.84 --> 4387.08
probably they might have been in the

4385.34 --> 4388.6990000000005
contract so who knows I don't know the

4387.08 --> 4391.34
details

4388.699 --> 4395.08
but uh yeah

4391.34 --> 4395.08
yeah there's gonna be a backlash

4396.14 --> 4399.64
time to bury your safe

4420.98 --> 4427.159
well the mess safe would probably always

4423.32 --> 4429.799999999999
want be the one that are completely

4427.159 --> 4432.099999999999
invisible not as in transparent as in

4429.8 --> 4432.1
like

4432.5 --> 4437.54
like you really

4434.719 --> 4439.96
think of Dwarven architecture think of

4437.54 --> 4443.0
Dwarven doors

4439.96 --> 4444.56
now not literally it's not like yeah you

4443.0 --> 4446.9
need to have a safe

4444.56 --> 4450.1990000000005
that you can only find

4446.9 --> 4452.48
when the Moonlight of September 11 is

4450.199 --> 4455.239
shining right at it and then you can see

4452.48 --> 4456.5599999999995
where it is not as Dwarven door like

4455.239 --> 4459.62
that

4456.56 --> 4461.659000000001
but as in like you're just staring at

4459.62 --> 4463.58
the wall if you don't know where it is

4461.659 --> 4465.32
if you don't literally feel with your

4463.58 --> 4468.08
finger and then oh here's the button

4465.32 --> 4471.62
then you just visually wouldn't be able

4468.08 --> 4474.14
to find it a Dwarven safe right it's

4471.62 --> 4474.92
like if you didn't know the person had a

4474.14 --> 4478.46
safe

4474.92 --> 4480.4400000000005
you would never have ever find out

4478.46 --> 4483.67
that would be the the alternative

4480.44 --> 4483.669999999999
[Music]

4484.64 --> 4487.360000000001
okay

4491.84 --> 4495.46
what the [ __ ] is wrong with you

4503.239 --> 4506.379999999999
are you okay

4506.84 --> 4512.42
because you seem a little deranged fuzzy

4510.679 --> 4516.04
Bush Monk

4512.42 --> 4516.04
I might have to time you out

4526.14 --> 4529.319
[Music]

4542.0 --> 4548.42
yeah I checked Richard G yeah no I know

4546.5 --> 4551.84
for you fuzzy Bush won't see them around

4548.42 --> 4555.32
in like Nathan Oakley chat

4551.84 --> 4558.9400000000005
but you might be like drunk or something

4555.32 --> 4558.94
you need help press one

4568.88 --> 4574.6
maybe just woke up and he hasn't figured

4572.179 --> 4577.28
out that he has a hangover yet

4574.6 --> 4580.159000000001
[Music]

4577.28 --> 4583.699
and he's like oh yeah it's an everyday

4580.159 --> 4586.46
check oh it's not there yet uh our win

4583.699 --> 4589.0599999999995
okay and then he's like

4586.46 --> 4589.06
uh

4591.58 --> 4595.9
could be pocket commenting

4596.3 --> 4599.5
that's hilarious

4600.679 --> 4605.84
it's pretty uncanny though that he would

4603.14 --> 4607.159000000001
like Contin multiple press like the dot

4605.84 --> 4610.42
so much

4607.159 --> 4610.42
that's really unusual

4624.94 --> 4632.259999999999
press two if you're an ass chatting you

4628.58 --> 4632.26
are ass chatting what the [ __ ]

4632.719 --> 4636.46
you mean pocket commenting

4639.26 --> 4643.6
could be

4641.06 --> 4643.6
whatever

4648.76 --> 4653.320000000001
probably it was probably that

4656.1 --> 4659.669000000001
[Applause]

4672.14 --> 4676.2390000000005
yes hello diver than Navy vet

4678.199 --> 4683.178999999999
right but gun safes are also intended to

4680.78 --> 4685.34
keep the hunt guns out of the hands of

4683.179 --> 4688.719
tyrants tracking trying to take those

4685.34 --> 4688.719
guns from citizens

4693.92 --> 4700.34
unless you like automatically already

4697.159 --> 4702.259999999999
classified like the government as

4700.34 --> 4704.4800000000005
burglars

4702.26 --> 4707.02
in that case yeah then it's a perfect

4704.48 --> 4707.0199999999995
statement

4715.4 --> 4719.839999999999
very annoying when that happens by the

4717.32 --> 4723.199
way another reason why I don't like

4719.84 --> 4724.9400000000005
freaking smartphones yeah

4723.199 --> 4727.48
there's butt calls because of

4724.94 --> 4727.48
smartphones

4729.679 --> 4735.26
like more than it used to be

4732.199 --> 4738.86
like bit with old-fashioned phones with

4735.26 --> 4740.6
clicky clicky yeah it's a lot tougher to

4738.86 --> 4744.339999999999
do butt calls

4740.6 --> 4747.8
right because most people's butts don't

4744.34 --> 4750.82
they're not tensile enough to cause

4747.8 --> 4750.820000000001
clicky clicky

4751.46 --> 4757.84
yeah

4752.9 --> 4757.839999999999
so clicky clicky prevents butt calls

4788.12 --> 4794.0599999999995
not Morse code no it's funny I kind of

4792.38 --> 4795.92
thought of that for a moment too if

4794.06 --> 4798.7390000000005
there was some code to it

4795.92 --> 4802.64
but checking it out it's mostly like the

4798.739 --> 4806.78
same couple of groups of letters

4802.64 --> 4809.62
right so k m

4806.78 --> 4809.62
Dot

4809.659 --> 4814.28
I

4811.219 --> 4816.679
so it seems like somebody right across

4814.28 --> 4817.82
the keyboard there's spaces there so

4816.679 --> 4819.62
space

4817.82 --> 4822.28
k m

4819.62 --> 4822.28
o

4822.32 --> 4827.179
right

4823.52 --> 4828.860000000001
l so it was somebody's hand on an actual

4827.179 --> 4830.6
keyboard

4828.86 --> 4833.36
I don't think there was a pocket thing

4830.6 --> 4836.0
because this is like literally if my

4833.36 --> 4838.339999999999
hand would go across this keyboard just

4836.0 --> 4839.48
like that those exact characters would

4838.34 --> 4841.52
all pop up

4839.48 --> 4844.04
because they're on the typical classical

4841.52 --> 4845.120000000001
keyboard form they're all next to each

4844.04 --> 4848.36
other

4845.12 --> 4850.82
and if I do my hand right across it then

4848.36 --> 4853.759999999999
those buttons will all be

4850.82 --> 4856.04
be getting pushed

4853.76 --> 4858.4400000000005
and even the enter is very close to it

4856.04 --> 4860.179
so it could be like hand on it then the

4858.44 --> 4864.199
thumb hits the enter

4860.179 --> 4865.6990000000005
your backhand hits the m

4864.199 --> 4868.699
the k

4865.699 --> 4873.08
the I the o

4868.699 --> 4878.0199999999995
zero and nine it it makes perfect sense

4873.08 --> 4878.0199999999995
the dot right next is right on it

4882.4 --> 4888.4
[Music]

4884.36 --> 4888.4
very odd by the way this is

4893.92 --> 4898.42
maybe he's like asleep at the keyboard

4898.58 --> 4902.96
that could actually be it

4901.1 --> 4904.9400000000005
maybe it's asleep at the keyboard he

4902.96 --> 4907.219
just woke up he did that and it's like

4904.94 --> 4909.4
walked away to get some breakfast or

4907.219 --> 4909.4
something

4911.78 --> 4917.54
I'm really reaching at this point I want

4914.659 --> 4919.04
to be so exactly sure what exactly

4917.54 --> 4922.239
happened there

4919.04 --> 4922.239
it's getting silly

4927.8 --> 4933.1990000000005
fell asleep and face fell on kid now I

4930.92 --> 4935.4800000000005
think it's a hand because the face

4933.199 --> 4937.759999999999
then a lot of other Keys would also be

4935.48 --> 4940.58
pressed right faces are a round shape

4937.76 --> 4944.54
and they will have a round circular

4940.58 --> 4947.78
print this the letters that were pushed

4944.54 --> 4949.88
are all exactly on a specific line which

4947.78 --> 4952.159
gives the indication that it was the

4949.88 --> 4954.02
side of a hand

4952.159 --> 4955.94
it's going diagonally on the keyboard

4954.02 --> 4958.52
and even the thumb

4955.94 --> 4962.44
might have been down on the enter

4958.52 --> 4962.4400000000005
because enter was pressed twice

4963.02 --> 4966.88
so I think it's a hand not a face

4968.239 --> 4974.0199999999995
really riveting

4970.52 --> 4974.02
riveting investigation

4976.9 --> 4982.639999999999
face plants are funny though I get it

4980.54 --> 4984.739
but usually when somebody plants their

4982.64 --> 4987.820000000001
face on the keyboard there's a lot more

4984.739 --> 4987.82
keys getting pressed

4992.0 --> 4997.82
right because of the sheer surface

4995.239 --> 4999.919999999999
of any side of the face is going to be

4997.82 --> 5002.98
pressing multiple keys

4999.92 --> 5006.54
not just a couple that happen to be

5002.98 --> 5006.54
sitting exactly in a line

5007.3 --> 5011.26
I'm taking this so seriously it's just

5009.219 --> 5013.86
getting nerdy

5011.26 --> 5013.860000000001
ah

5013.9 --> 5018.699
hope he's okay

5016.179 --> 5019.659
oh at worst he like karate chopped his

5018.699 --> 5022.32
keyboard

5019.659 --> 5022.32
or something

5022.54 --> 5025.8
he's probably fine

5041.02 --> 5047.080000000001
nobody pressed one yet so we can assume

5043.659 --> 5048.94
he's okay fair enough

5047.08 --> 5051.54
okay

5048.94 --> 5051.54
right

5054.04 --> 5058.719
I'm gonna get a cold drink from those

5056.44 --> 5061.739
hairs a bit tough

5058.719 --> 5061.7390000000005
grapefruit juice

5062.62 --> 5065.34
be right back

5083.02 --> 5085.620000000001
foreign

5135.699 --> 5142.48
epic I love this drink

5139.84 --> 5146.76
it's not the diameter of quality but oh

5142.48 --> 5146.759999999999
oh well it's great

5157.78 --> 5162.82
all right

5159.82 --> 5162.82
foreign

5179.21 --> 5182.35
[Music]

5193.48 --> 5198.159
right so yeah let's let's try to get a

5196.48 --> 5202.138999999999
bit more substantial although it's yeah

5198.159 --> 5202.138999999999
we got like 20 minutes left

5203.02 --> 5207.6
I mean it's funny about the weird

5204.58 --> 5207.6
comment and all that

5210.88 --> 5217.1990000000005
I want to get a bit more serious

5213.4 --> 5217.199
also please support me

5219.639 --> 5224.219
through the PayPal it'll be great

5227.199 --> 5233.199
then I can keep going I mean we're

5229.719 --> 5236.02
almost like halfway the month so

5233.199 --> 5238.98
I'm already very grateful that I was

5236.02 --> 5238.9800000000005
able to get this far

5242.26 --> 5247.08
and that I I will be able to eat

5244.48 --> 5247.08
definitely

5256.6 --> 5263.92
Dr Cohen yes new biology

5261.4 --> 5268.5599999999995
very similar to German new medicine oh

5263.92 --> 5268.56
of course who the hell is Dr Cohen

5271.99 --> 5275.1089999999995
[Music]

5279.54 --> 5284.88
alternative medicine practitioner

5281.679 --> 5284.88
there's no photo of him

5284.92 --> 5291.639
what the [ __ ] there's no photo of him on

5287.98 --> 5293.98
a freaking Wikipedia page what the hell

5291.639 --> 5295.12
okay this guy

5293.98 --> 5298.379999999999
wait

5295.12 --> 5298.38
there's a multiple

5309.52 --> 5313.26
so what's the full name

5317.38 --> 5321.06
Dr Lanka

5321.219 --> 5325.26
Dr Lanka Cohen

5326.44 --> 5328.919999999999
what

5329.56 --> 5332.1
no

5338.86 --> 5343.299999999999
who is that

5341.26 --> 5344.92
okay this freaking Google search is not

5343.3 --> 5349.4400000000005
working

5344.92 --> 5349.4400000000005
Tom cone separate person yeah thanks

5357.58 --> 5363.179
right yeah that guy

5360.219 --> 5363.179
think I've seen him

5367.9 --> 5373.44
so he's like sort of creating a German

5370.239 --> 5373.44
new medicine out of it

5378.159 --> 5380.638999999999
okay

5381.46 --> 5386.159
it's very water-centric that's

5383.62 --> 5386.159
interesting

5391.06 --> 5395.139
God

5392.98 --> 5397.66
you guys also seem to be part of the

5395.139 --> 5400.87
Brotherhood though

5397.66 --> 5400.87
[Music]

5409.179 --> 5412.8
he is part of the Brotherhood

5413.739 --> 5418.54
so I guess the Brotherhood is trying to

5416.56 --> 5421.659000000001
assimilate German new medicine because

5418.54 --> 5424.12
well it works

5421.659 --> 5425.799999999999
but they can't just recognize like oh

5424.12 --> 5428.98
it's German new medicine no they'll have

5425.8 --> 5431.139
to like reinvent it and rename it and

5428.98 --> 5435.419999999999
that's what they will be doing and hey

5431.139 --> 5435.42
if it freaking works it works

5435.52 --> 5440.1
I'll just refer to the old stuff

5451.36 --> 5455.679
hmm

5453.1 --> 5459.42
[Music]

5455.679 --> 5459.42
hey Emma field with CEO

5460.239 --> 5465.839999999999
I missed most of the show

5462.46 --> 5465.84
it's been kind of silly

5466.179 --> 5471.9400000000005
but fun I think and we were yeah I had a

5469.48 --> 5474.94
bit of a community talk like

5471.94 --> 5477.099999999999
how much it stands out to me like

5474.94 --> 5479.62
that this chat really is like its own

5477.1 --> 5481.4800000000005
micro community and how fascinating that

5479.62 --> 5485.0199999999995
is and what

5481.48 --> 5487.0
the potential value that we have

5485.02 --> 5490.84
and that I definitely would encourage

5487.0 --> 5494.219
you guys to seek each other out but

5490.84 --> 5494.219
outside of my chat

5494.8 --> 5501.05
I would think it would be epic if we

5497.38 --> 5503.1990000000005
could like become like a friend Circle

5501.05 --> 5505.2390000000005
[Music]

5503.199 --> 5507.879999999999
where it's not just all standard around

5505.239 --> 5509.44
me but like you also like become friends

5507.88 --> 5511.12
among one another

5509.44 --> 5514.0599999999995
so that

5511.12 --> 5516.28
God forbid at some point I suddenly go

5514.06 --> 5517.38
out of the picture that you guys would

5516.28 --> 5519.159
keep going together

5517.38 --> 5521.5
[Music]

5519.159 --> 5523.299999999999
that's not just oh our wins gone and

5521.5 --> 5526.86
boom you never hear of each other again

5523.3 --> 5526.860000000001
that would be such a shame

5527.92 --> 5530.1
foreign

5537.46 --> 5540.46
Jesus

5542.08 --> 5548.4
why why was that

5545.08 --> 5548.4
why why did you

5548.8 --> 5555.659000000001
sleep right why did you start sleeping

5551.56 --> 5555.659000000001
8am that's crazy Emma Peel

5558.4 --> 5564.599999999999
yeah I'd be sick too

5560.56 --> 5564.6
I take it easy today if I were you

5566.139 --> 5569.86
all right what

5570.88 --> 5575.9800000000005
in the nights

5572.679 --> 5578.88
how what

5575.98 --> 5578.879999999999
I don't get it

5586.54 --> 5591.5199999999995
I mean the worst thing that can prevent

5588.639 --> 5594.6
me from sleeping in the night is

5591.52 --> 5594.6
freaking mosquitoes

5594.699 --> 5597.178999999999
right

5597.219 --> 5602.56
and in the morning that gets worse it's

5599.32 --> 5604.78
like once it becomes like nine o'clock

5602.56 --> 5606.400000000001
and the sun really starts hitting the

5604.78 --> 5608.5
wall here that's when it actually

5606.4 --> 5610.9
becomes impossible to start to sleep

5608.5 --> 5612.639
because I'll just wake up all drowning

5610.9 --> 5614.679
in my own sweat

5612.639 --> 5616.92
like even if I don't have a blanket over

5614.679 --> 5616.92
me

5617.8 --> 5623.02
I don't even know how you would be able

5619.54 --> 5626.32
to sleep after 8 A.M and not before that

5623.02 --> 5628.120000000001
I don't get it

5626.32 --> 5631.08
couldn't you just like take a cold

5628.12 --> 5631.08
shower or something

5633.52 --> 5637.9800000000005
and then try to go back to sleep

5635.199 --> 5637.98
wouldn't that work

5646.42 --> 5651.159
maybe next time you could try that

5649.0 --> 5655.0
if it's literally like too warm to sleep

5651.159 --> 5658.719
well then you gotta like cool it off

5655.0 --> 5661.0
I mean I very rarely do that but it just

5658.719 --> 5662.679
because it's not been that hot but I

5661.0 --> 5665.38
still remember that like going on

5662.679 --> 5667.719
vacation in Spain in high summer

5665.38 --> 5670.78
sometimes it would be so [ __ ] hot

5667.719 --> 5672.34
even at night that yeah like it is too

5670.78 --> 5674.199
hot to sleep I remember having

5672.34 --> 5676.659000000001
experienced that

5674.199 --> 5678.638999999999
because it would be like a 40 degree day

5676.659 --> 5682.0599999999995
and then at night it would still be like

5678.639 --> 5685.86
really above 20 and very uncomfortable

5682.06 --> 5685.860000000001
but then like a cold shower

5685.96 --> 5689.219
would be very nice

5692.32 --> 5696.94
it would not by the way be super cold

5694.42 --> 5699.1
because the water when it's in Spain

5696.94 --> 5701.28
there like the water wouldn't get that

5699.1 --> 5703.780000000001
cold

5701.28 --> 5707.08
it would stay

5703.78 --> 5710.32
I mean cooler than the heat but I mean

5707.08 --> 5712.96
all that water there was always like

5710.32 --> 5715.299999999999
it was never super cold

5712.96 --> 5717.659
but it will cool you off in the middle

5715.3 --> 5717.659000000001
of the night

5719.02 --> 5723.6990000000005
oh you're ill oh

5722.08 --> 5726.0599999999995
[ __ ]

5723.699 --> 5729.9
okay

5726.06 --> 5729.900000000001
we got vitamin C

5738.34 --> 5741.6
you have fever

5743.739 --> 5748.239
are you so are you sick or are you not

5746.8 --> 5750.219
sick

5748.239 --> 5752.0199999999995
because otherwise you're just saying

5750.219 --> 5754.6
like yeah the temperature got so hot

5752.02 --> 5759.06
that I got a fever effect of it that

5754.6 --> 5759.06
makes sense and it's not healthy

5759.76 --> 5763.0
you're gonna have a lot of concentration

5761.44 --> 5765.5199999999995
problems if you got that hot because

5763.0 --> 5769.239
that's basically a heat stroke

5765.52 --> 5771.88
right when you get so overheated

5769.239 --> 5774.28
that you get like a fever from it that's

5771.88 --> 5776.4400000000005
called a heat stroke

5774.28 --> 5780.12
usually that only happens when you're

5776.44 --> 5780.12
directly in sunlight and stuff

5785.739 --> 5788.879999999999
doing the test

5789.04 --> 5791.82
wait what

5794.199 --> 5800.5
oh

5795.46 --> 5801.88
right yeah the the supposed yay you have

5800.5 --> 5804.52
flu

5801.88 --> 5807.76
yeah you got the test so yeah then you

5804.52 --> 5809.080000000001
get the flu I know

5807.76 --> 5812.679
yeah

5809.08 --> 5815.0199999999995
just like roommate also had the flu one

5812.679 --> 5816.6990000000005
thing really helps though when you get

5815.02 --> 5820.679
that by the way I'm a PO you know what

5816.699 --> 5820.678999999999
that is vitamin C

5823.3 --> 5830.56
you must have vitamin C you must use it

5828.1 --> 5833.02
any form of flu by the way any form of

5830.56 --> 5835.860000000001
flu vitamin C always works it always has

5833.02 --> 5835.860000000001
and it always will

5838.96 --> 5844.679
it had the flu before you took the test

5841.0 --> 5844.679
while benium just made it worse

5852.4 --> 5857.199
and I don't get it why the [ __ ] would

5854.98 --> 5860.5
you take a test if you already had the

5857.199 --> 5862.54
flu why why you had the flu you don't

5860.5 --> 5866.52
need to test anything

5862.54 --> 5866.5199999999995
you have the flu why would you test it

5869.44 --> 5873.759999999999
vitamin C loads of fresh orange juice

5871.9 --> 5876.48
yeah be careful with the fresh orange

5873.76 --> 5876.4800000000005
juice though

5878.26 --> 5883.7390000000005
just make sure you get the vitamin C

5880.38 --> 5886.659000000001
fresh orange juice

5883.739 --> 5889.959999999999
depends on the oranges

5886.659 --> 5892.92
like yellow orange juice is not as great

5889.96 --> 5892.92
as you'd think

5893.199 --> 5895.44
foreign

5895.54 --> 5900.4
go for the blood orange juice the red

5898.179 --> 5903.04
stuff that is you can have like as much

5900.4 --> 5905.44
of that as you can there's no detriment

5903.04 --> 5908.56
but be careful with the regular oranges

5905.44 --> 5910.659
I dare it very tasty yeah I love a glass

5908.56 --> 5913.96
of orange juice

5910.659 --> 5916.0599999999995
but don't drink a lot of it

5913.96 --> 5917.679
because you think it's healthy if you're

5916.06 --> 5919.719
gonna drink orange juice for the health

5917.679 --> 5922.9
benefits and more than usual then drink

5919.719 --> 5927.06
red or red blood orange juice

5922.9 --> 5927.0599999999995
that one is actually really healthy

5927.1 --> 5930.780000000001
orange man Badness

5935.32 --> 5943.38
went through all of this yesterday

5937.62 --> 5943.38
yeah but I still gonna tell you though

5944.679 --> 5947.159
right

5950.8 --> 5956.1
yeah I'm not gonna pull you through all

5952.659 --> 5956.099999999999
of it again I mean yeah

5958.06 --> 5963.159000000001
it is a fact I mean

5960.34 --> 5967.179
nobody's gonna take a test

5963.159 --> 5970.719
like that and then not have anything

5967.179 --> 5974.04
negative happen out of it take a test

5970.719 --> 5974.04
it's gonna make things worse

5974.92 --> 5979.8
constitutional

5977.26 --> 5979.8
what

5991.78 --> 5995.159
right yeah Marky Mark

5998.54 --> 6001.93
[Music]

6003.3 --> 6008.6990000000005
what I mean technically that's how is

6006.06 --> 6013.320000000001
that exactly unconstitutional like if

6008.699 --> 6017.099999999999
there's that standard police operation

6013.32 --> 6021.599999999999
if there is evidence presented enough to

6017.1 --> 6024.719
Warrant further investigation then yeah

6021.6 --> 6025.679
that's kind of how it does work though I

6024.719 --> 6028.32
don't understand how that's

6025.679 --> 6030.0
unconstitutional when a judge judge has

6028.32 --> 6031.799999999999
already

6030.0 --> 6032.99
has seen enough

6031.8 --> 6034.26
evidence

6032.99 --> 6040.28
[Music]

6034.26 --> 6040.280000000001
of basically yeah crime of some kind

6046.739 --> 6051.0
so actually don't think it's

6048.42 --> 6053.219
unconstitutional Marky Mark I mean it

6051.0 --> 6055.8
can be super abused

6053.219 --> 6057.4800000000005
right if the reason for doing it just

6055.8 --> 6060.06
doesn't make any [ __ ] sense there's a

6057.48 --> 6061.919999999999
stupid political nonsense yeah then it's

6060.06 --> 6064.580000000001
highly unwarranted highly

6061.92 --> 6068.159
unconstitutional it's a total corrupted

6064.58 --> 6070.639
application of such a cons of such a

6068.159 --> 6070.638999999999
procedure

6073.739 --> 6080.82
but in general yeah I mean

6077.58 --> 6083.58
if somebody if there's indication

6080.82 --> 6085.86
enough for a judge to like

6083.58 --> 6089.1
be highly like to

6085.86 --> 6092.159
warrant further investigation

6089.1 --> 6094.9800000000005
then yeah they should be able to

6092.159 --> 6099.0199999999995
check those things

6094.98 --> 6099.0199999999995
that's normal isn't it

6101.04 --> 6106.1
like what else would an investigator do

6106.98 --> 6111.659
right I mean if there's no leads

6109.679 --> 6114.42
whatsoever

6111.659 --> 6117.0
if then somebody says no we I I'm very

6114.42 --> 6119.04
sure he's done something and if then the

6117.0 --> 6120.6
judge says okay we'll just investigate

6119.04 --> 6123.9
further and do all those things when

6120.6 --> 6128.0
there is actually no real lead yeah then

6123.9 --> 6128.0
it becomes a violation logically

6129.719 --> 6133.159
isn't that what happened with the safe

6133.199 --> 6137.339999999999
yeah

6134.699 --> 6140.638999999999
yeah that is true yes it's a false

6137.34 --> 6143.34
premise that's right

6140.639 --> 6146.76
come on

6143.34 --> 6149.2390000000005
right so yeah it's a false premise

6146.76 --> 6151.679
the procedure itself is not

6149.239 --> 6154.799999999999
unconstitutional but when it's a false

6151.679 --> 6157.1990000000005
premise then it is

6154.8 --> 6159.06
right just like violating somebody's

6157.199 --> 6161.4
rights because they've been declared a

6159.06 --> 6163.320000000001
terrorist because they just said

6161.4 --> 6165.48
something and that is it

6163.32 --> 6168.9
there's no actual actions that would

6165.48 --> 6172.138999999999
literally legally warrant

6168.9 --> 6173.599999999999
Declaration of terrorism

6172.139 --> 6177.139
then it's

6173.6 --> 6177.139
slow-mo what the [ __ ]

6183.659 --> 6186.78
it was a false premise this is on the

6185.4 --> 6189.179
judge yes

6186.78 --> 6191.9
correct

6189.179 --> 6191.9
I guess

6207.78 --> 6213.08
ah hey yeah die for that maybe but

6210.179 --> 6213.08
indeed

6223.619 --> 6229.199
yeah I don't know what's going on there

6226.08 --> 6233.6
slow ball I mean they need a new phone

6229.199 --> 6233.599999999999
getting one it's possessed

6233.82 --> 6236.659
uh

6244.92 --> 6247.52
all right

6249.36 --> 6253.139
but yeah I mean slow mode be careful

6251.4 --> 6254.759999999999
though if it keeps reoccurring I will

6253.139 --> 6256.4400000000005
eventually I could take your wrench

6254.76 --> 6259.8
because

6256.44 --> 6261.0599999999995
it's become unstable it's not because I

6259.8 --> 6262.860000000001
don't like you or I think you didn't

6261.06 --> 6264.360000000001
things wrong but if your telephone sucks

6262.86 --> 6265.799999999999
at this stabilizing this [ __ ] happens

6264.36 --> 6267.96
more often

6265.8 --> 6270.360000000001
then kind of like with

6267.96 --> 6271.5
lumpy gas in a vacuum I will take your

6270.36 --> 6273.42
wrench

6271.5 --> 6275.76
because lumpy gas in the vacuum every

6273.42 --> 6278.719
time I given him a wrench on his [ __ ]

6275.76 --> 6278.719
always goes crazy

6282.48 --> 6287.099999999999
anyway it's okay for now

6285.42 --> 6290.04
yeah

6287.1 --> 6292.52
it does slumpy gas in the vacuum don't

6290.04 --> 6297.5
think I I forgot about all that

6292.52 --> 6297.5
and I like you dude but I mean

6300.36 --> 6304.339999999999
giving you a wrench is dangerous

6305.82 --> 6308.54
huh

6315.84 --> 6320.78
haven't been texting because the phone

6317.58 --> 6320.78
has gone insane hmm

6321.6 --> 6326.84
they're still part of this mode

6323.04 --> 6326.84
definitely of course he is

6350.42 --> 6354.3
right so is there like an objection to

6353.159 --> 6356.82
the title

6354.3 --> 6360.179
from what I gather

6356.82 --> 6363.179
Marky Mark are you saying that my title

6360.179 --> 6366.36
is blaming the the Safe Company when

6363.179 --> 6369.3
it's the judge's fault

6366.36 --> 6370.92
is that your claim

6369.3 --> 6376.46
can I have it

6370.92 --> 6376.46
confirmed or denied directly in the chat

6377.34 --> 6380.96
because you might have a bit of a coin

6382.95 --> 6387.3
[Music]

6384.9 --> 6390.119
it's just that from what I understood

6387.3 --> 6392.6990000000005
it's like the FBI just moved over they

6390.119 --> 6393.42
didn't have like a judge's order to do

6392.699 --> 6396.98
it

6393.42 --> 6396.9800000000005
but I'm not sure now

6401.04 --> 6407.119
that was involved in January 6th

6404.58 --> 6407.119
so

6410.219 --> 6414.36
look up what happened yeah well we just

6412.679 --> 6416.28
found out during the show that's why

6414.36 --> 6418.5
this isn't a title because in the middle

6416.28 --> 6421.46
somebody brought that

6418.5 --> 6421.46
in the chat

6429.96 --> 6434.52
before issuing a warrant for a safe

6432.78 --> 6437.119
yeah

6434.52 --> 6437.119000000001
okay

6440.94 --> 6446.28
okay fair enough

6443.52 --> 6447.900000000001
because like if I don't know what the

6446.28 --> 6450.119
American maybe American Liberty

6447.9 --> 6452.5199999999995
Corporation did exacts are like really

6450.119 --> 6454.139
pissed off that that happened

6452.52 --> 6456.119000000001
I don't know

6454.139 --> 6457.38
I don't know if they're like globalist

6456.119 --> 6459.599999999999
[ __ ]

6457.38 --> 6462.84
or if they're actually like really

6459.6 --> 6465.860000000001
American Constitution and they they feel

6462.84 --> 6465.860000000001
victimized I don't know

6466.56 --> 6472.619000000001
I hope so

6469.56 --> 6474.360000000001
you know you want a company that that

6472.619 --> 6476.04
deals in safes

6474.36 --> 6479.699
to be

6476.04 --> 6483.56
well morally upright and and not

6479.699 --> 6483.5599999999995
corrupted so I don't know

6484.26 --> 6490.139
judge can issue warrant for your house

6486.36 --> 6492.839999999999
right the search search warrant

6490.139 --> 6494.58
but only if there's like already enough

6492.84 --> 6496.619000000001
leads

6494.58 --> 6499.0199999999995
right if there is like a strong

6496.619 --> 6501.119
indication of a criminal thing that's

6499.02 --> 6503.34
happened

6501.119 --> 6506.219
it's part of procedures the judge can't

6503.34 --> 6508.6990000000005
just like oh just do it without any

6506.219 --> 6508.699
leads

6508.98 --> 6512.239
you can't just do it like that

6512.46 --> 6517.02
there has to be a good lead

6514.86 --> 6519.96
I wonder though like

6517.02 --> 6523.080000000001
if a judge would just say look oh I have

6519.96 --> 6528.54
a warrant for this and the person asks

6523.08 --> 6531.239
so can you show me exactly what that is

6528.54 --> 6534.719
that they could like this is not a

6531.239 --> 6536.94
proper warrant like we deny your judge's

6534.719 --> 6539.1
worth like is that the possible or like

6536.94 --> 6540.659
as soon as a judge just says it is then

6539.1 --> 6542.46
it's law

6540.659 --> 6545.599999999999
like it can be questioned until after

6542.46 --> 6545.6
how does that work even

6546.0 --> 6551.76
can you resist it like this is an

6547.92 --> 6555.119
unlawful seizure or search

6551.76 --> 6558.119000000001
the justification is like politically

6555.119 --> 6561.259999999999
corrupted can you do that officially do

6558.119 --> 6561.259999999999
you have a right to do that

6562.139 --> 6566.96
for years internet search history

6571.32 --> 6578.4
why is the safe such a big deal because

6574.82 --> 6579.84
it's literally called the safe

6578.4 --> 6584.04
a safe

6579.84 --> 6586.26
is assumed to be safe

6584.04 --> 6588.48
if you know what I mean

6586.26 --> 6593.6
right that's why it's a big deal

6588.48 --> 6593.599999999999
because it's safe is assumed to be safe

6595.26 --> 6601.26
possible that I am a reptilian or a form

6598.26 --> 6603.96
of non-human makes sense some of my

6601.26 --> 6607.58
super powers

6603.96 --> 6607.58
well I am an elf

6608.52 --> 6614.280000000001
my spirit might be like hybridized with

6611.52 --> 6615.2390000000005
like a weird non-human Spirit thing or

6614.28 --> 6617.219
something

6615.239 --> 6619.699
if that's true it happened when I was

6617.219 --> 6619.699
very young

6622.199 --> 6626.36
but I mean

6624.36 --> 6630.0
I'm not like

6626.36 --> 6632.58
another yeah I'm more like it all

6630.0 --> 6634.739
depends on like how I would present

6632.58 --> 6636.42
myself in the in the Dark World to

6634.739 --> 6638.5199999999995
somebody else I don't know what I would

6636.42 --> 6639.78
look I think I'd still look pretty damn

6638.52 --> 6642.119000000001
human

6639.78 --> 6643.739
maybe a light a little bit more pointy

6642.119 --> 6647.0599999999995
ears or something

6643.739 --> 6647.0599999999995
but I doubt even that

6650.52 --> 6655.26
I think in the dark world I just very

6652.619 --> 6657.36
much look exactly like I am I don't have

6655.26 --> 6659.52
another form

6657.36 --> 6661.08
right when you have another form in the

6659.52 --> 6663.659000000001
dark world that's also an indication

6661.08 --> 6666.0
that you're not presenting yourself as

6663.659 --> 6667.46
you really are and by not presenting

6666.0 --> 6669.659
yourself as you really are you get a

6667.46 --> 6672.9
compartmentalization where

6669.659 --> 6676.32
your overt side becomes the More Human

6672.9 --> 6681.0
Side while the compartmentalized Secret

6676.32 --> 6683.82
side dwells off even further Beyond

6681.0 --> 6686.28
human into other type behaviors because

6683.82 --> 6687.84
of its secrecy there's nothing to hold

6686.28 --> 6690.9
it back you see

6687.84 --> 6693.659000000001
and that might also be the factor that

6690.9 --> 6696.239
actually alienates people's people's

6693.659 --> 6697.92
inner self to the degree that another

6696.239 --> 6700.86
might

6697.92 --> 6703.08
view them in a hallucinatory state and

6700.86 --> 6704.96
then see them as for example reptilian

6703.08 --> 6707.88
because they're in their

6704.96 --> 6710.88
compartmentalized side has alienated

6707.88 --> 6714.179
itself from the normal human frequency

6710.88 --> 6716.82
to a degree where it actually becomes

6714.179 --> 6718.5
like a reptile Spirit almost

6716.82 --> 6721.86
and then

6718.5 --> 6724.56
if you were like a dark World Vision

6721.86 --> 6726.659
you would see them for their inner self

6724.56 --> 6730.46
right that that would be an explanation

6726.659 --> 6730.46
that might make sense to you

6745.33 --> 6750.619
[Music]

6751.739 --> 6756.299999999999
I was like these impromptu out of

6754.02 --> 6757.8
nowhere questions that are radical and

6756.3 --> 6760.08
seem kooky

6757.8 --> 6762.3
because I'll just literally answer them

6760.08 --> 6764.699
immediately as if they're perfectly

6762.3 --> 6767.6990000000005
normal questions that's my thing that I

6764.699 --> 6770.04
could do yeah I can answer extraordinary

6767.699 --> 6772.44
bizarre questions like they are

6770.04 --> 6775.0199999999995
perfectly normal

6772.44 --> 6777.0599999999995
I like it I like that I'm capable of

6775.02 --> 6780.26
doing that it catches people off guard I

6777.06 --> 6780.26
think that's an entertaining

6780.42 --> 6784.639
it's a very personal form of

6782.1 --> 6784.639
entertainment

6785.9 --> 6791.879999999999
right anyway I'm gonna round out the

6788.34 --> 6795.4800000000005
show it's been very interesting

6791.88 --> 6797.06
is this judge for sure corrupt is that

6795.48 --> 6801.379999999999
the deal

6797.06 --> 6805.4400000000005
uh well it's a January 6 stuff so yeah

6801.38 --> 6807.900000000001
very very very very corrupt

6805.44 --> 6809.879999999999
those judges don't even follow proper

6807.9 --> 6812.599999999999
procedures

6809.88 --> 6812.6
off the court

6813.0 --> 6819.239
just like that crazy judge

6816.42 --> 6822.0
situation like the the court situation

6819.239 --> 6824.159
with Alex Jones which is like a whole uh

6822.0 --> 6826.86
convoluted to hell and all that with

6824.159 --> 6829.92
but I mean the way that happened I saw

6826.86 --> 6834.839999999999
some that was just like

6829.92 --> 6837.6
a very poorly written script for a Law

6834.84 --> 6841.139
and Order television program I mean that

6837.6 --> 6843.3
was completely nonsensical everything

6841.139 --> 6845.04
that happened in that Court situation

6843.3 --> 6847.679
and I think it's kind of the same people

6845.04 --> 6849.48
that are doing the January say like they

6847.679 --> 6852.42
are ridiculous

6849.48 --> 6854.94
they've completely thrown overboard like

6852.42 --> 6856.7390000000005
normal court procedures it makes no

6854.94 --> 6859.82
sense at all that they can even do that

6856.739 --> 6859.82
and get away with it

6860.04 --> 6866.639
ridiculous anyway oh it's raining huh

6864.36 --> 6868.98
okay

6866.639 --> 6871.34
all right but I am gonna round out the

6868.98 --> 6871.339999999999

6930.36 --> 6935.639
that power of the summer and we hold it

6933.239 --> 6937.86
in ourselves and we keep it throughout

6935.639 --> 6939.4800000000005
the Autumn time and that'll give us an

6937.86 --> 6941.699
edge over all those stupid doom and

6939.48 --> 6943.799999999999
gloomers that just threw it overboard

6941.699 --> 6946.919999999999
and forgot about it and now just moping

6943.8 --> 6949.08
instead you don't have to do that you

6965.639 --> 6968.46
this summer

6966.84 --> 6971.34
like whatever the weather is going to be

6968.46 --> 6974.52

6971.34 --> 6977.219
over oh it's over the Summer's over no

6974.52 --> 6980.040000000001
no no the Summer's over when the energy

6977.219 --> 6982.8
is really depleted which usually happens

6980.04 --> 6984.42
somewhere in the middle of winter

6982.8 --> 6985.8
that's when the Summer is gone and

6984.42 --> 6988.139
that's where you have to like really

6985.8 --> 6991.02
like build up again

6988.139 --> 6993.36
